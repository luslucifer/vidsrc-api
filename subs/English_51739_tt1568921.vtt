00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.770
I'll never forget that summer

3
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.850
I spent a week in the old house
where my mother grew up

8
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.800
Almost there.  
Feeling all right?

9
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.990
Yes.

KARIGURASHI

12
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.460
NO ARRIETTY

13
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.460
Haru ...how many timeshave I told her?

14
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.900
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

15
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.280
Haru!

16
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.290
You're blocking the driveway again.

17
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.210
Sho?

18
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.380
Where are you?

19
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.450
Don't touch!

20
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.560
These aren't for you.

21
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.950
- Arrietty!
- What?


22
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.980
You went outside again.  Didn't you?

23
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.550
And you might clean up
this room, young lady.


24
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.490
It's my own little garden.

25
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.260
If you ask me,
it looks like a mess.


26
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.760
Oh!  Is that a bay leaf?

27
00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.940
Oh well, I guess this means
your birthday comes early.


28
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.010
Enough for a whole year.

29
00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.520
But the bay tree is
so far away.


30
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.950
If a human being saw you...

31
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.680
I'm always careful.

32
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.620
The world is full of
dangerous creatures.


33
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:41.930
Your great uncle...

34
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.690
...was eaten by a frog.  Right?

35
00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.730
Doesn't that shiso smell lovely?

36
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.640
Yes, it does.

37
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.200
With a bit of sugar
I could make shiso juice.


38
00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.840
Wait till tonight.
I'll borrow some for you.


39
00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.880
My first borrowing ever!
I've been practicing night and day.


40
00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:08.020
Papa's home.

41
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.130
Welcome back.

42
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.660
- Papa, about tonight...
- There's a boy in the house.


43
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.340
I saw him.

44
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.710
- No! Arrietty...
- He didn't see me!


45
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.880
I hid behind the bay leaf.
Papa, we're still going, aren't we?


46
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.780
I won't hear of it.
It's too dangerous.


47
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.990
But he's just a child!

48
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.050
Papa, I've been waiting
for such a long time.


49
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.330
The children can be more savage
than the grownups.


50
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.230
I'll be fine!

51
00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.530
Youngsters go to bed early.

52
00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.060
Thank you, Papa!

53
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.570
But Pod...

54
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.070
The boy's sick.
Don't worry, we'll be fine.


55
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.570
But still...

56
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.110
Stop worrying, Mother.
We'll be more careful.


57
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.720
Arrietty will be 14 soon.

58
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.860
Someday she'll have to
survive without our help.


59
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.460
Sometimes I think
we're the last Borrowers in the world.


60
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:50.390
Whatever you need,
just ask Haru.


61
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.620
All right.

62
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.820
Haru, I'm depending on you.

63
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.760
Yes ma'am.

64
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.110
Let's shut the screen.
Keep the bugs out.


65
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.560
Shouldn't you wear something darker?

66
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.690
I already decided!

67
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.690
I hope you can borrow
some tissue paper.


68
00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.130
And a bit of sugar, perhaps?

69
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:09.070
We could have shiso juice
and sugar for the tea.


70
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.030
But anything's just fine.

71
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.910
We'll be back soon.

72
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:20.780
Please be careful.

73
00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.180
We will.

74
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:55.220
Arrietty!

75
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.300
Sorry!

76
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.080
- Hold these for me.
- Yes, Papa.


77
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.050
Hold on tight!

78
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.190
Arrietty?

79
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.520
Ready?

80
00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:50.180
Everything's so huge!

81
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.850
The world of human beings.

82
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.950
The sugar's over there.

83
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.590
Wait for me down there.

84
00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:50.010
Papa, you're great!

85
00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.520
Now let's get that tissue.

86
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.940
Papa, okay.

87
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.790
Your first borrowing.

88
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.260
Be careful, it's sharp.

89
00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.620
I will!

90
00:17:07.450 --> 00:17:09.390
Papa, borrowing is such fun!

91
00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.560
Look down there.

92
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.800
Rats.  Steer clear of them.
They're trouble.


93
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:27.600
I'm not afraid.

94
00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.270
I'm ready for anything.
I've got this!


95
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.470
Sometimes it's best not to
go looking for danger.


96
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.460
What is this place?

97
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.390
Human beings made it
for their dolls.


98
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.140
It's just perfect for us!

99
00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.370
I'm sure Mother would love
that dresser over there.


100
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.310
These things aren't for borrowing.

101
00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:48.610
If anything went missing
they'd know right away.


102
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.610
Oh...

103
00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:12.920
Don't be afraid.

104
00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.480
I saw you.

105
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:38.520
In the garden.
It was you, wasn't it?


106
00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:47.790
My mother told me about you.

107
00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.660
She saw little people here
when she was young.


108
00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:57.130
Was it you that she saw?

109
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:00.940
Was it?

110
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.390
I'm sorry, Papa.

111
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.190
He saw me today,
out in the garden.


112
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.200
I should've been more careful.

113
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.030
I hope he didn't frighten you.

114
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.070
Best not tell your mother,
it will only worry her.


115
00:23:04.670 --> 00:23:05.570
All right.

116
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:16.580
You don't always have to run.
Observe them first, then decide.


117
00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:31.890
We're home.

118
00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:33.830
Safe and sound.

119
00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:46.780
And...?

120
00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:50.080
Things didn't go well this time.

121
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.550
This light gave out
before we finished.


122
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:55.720
Oh dear.

123
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.450
We had to give up
on the sugar.


124
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:03.460
Don't give it a thought.
At least you're  safe and sound.


125
00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:08.900
Arrietty, you found something.
Show your mother your first borrowing.


126
00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:19.840
What a pretty pin.

127
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.950
Time for bed.

128
00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.630
Good night.

129
00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.170
She looks worn out.

130
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:43.830
Shall make some tea?

131
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:18.460
Sho!

132
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:21.830
Come in the house.
You'll catch cold out there.


133
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.100
A cube of sugar?
But whatever for?


134
00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.050
He left it by the grating.

135
00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.520
It's probably the same one
I dropped last night.


136
00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:17.210
What?

137
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.050
What do you mean,
you dropped it?


138
00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.200
Don't touch it.
Do you understand?


139
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.200
It's a trap.

140
00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.590
They're trying to catch us!

141
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:39.370
We'll have to stop borrowing
for a while.


142
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.140
Maybe they already
know where we are.


143
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.240
Pod, we'll have to move!

144
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.880
This was such a lovely house.

145
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.410
Now we'll have to
start all over again.


146
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.220
Well, let's see how things go.

147
00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.580
Now eat, soup's getting cold.

148
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:02.760
Why did it have to be sugar?

149
00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.020
Thank you Arrietty.

150
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.260
I wanted to hang everything
while the sun's out.


151
00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.960
You know I love doing laundry.

152
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:41.630
- I'm going to nap for a bit.
- All right.


153
00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:26.280
You forgot something

154
00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:40.260
You came back.

155
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:45.100
Wait, don't go.

156
00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.250
Please leave us alone.

157
00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:54.080
I wanted to tell you that.

158
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.250
I want to talk to you.

159
00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.780
Human beings are dangerous.

160
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:04.080
If we're seen, we have to leave.
My parents said so.


161
00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.290
You have a family?
I envy you.


162
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.570
Don't you have one?

163
00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.600
Yes, but I practically
never see my father.


164
00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:19.640
Mother's so busy at work,
she barely has time for me.


165
00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:22.140
Really...

166
00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:28.780
My name's Sho.
What's your name?


167
00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.520
Do you have one?

168
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:36.890
Of course I have a name!

169
00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.790
It's Arrietty.

170
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:42.830
Arrietty... Arrietty...

171
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.800
That's pretty.

172
00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.550
Won't you let me see you?
Just for a moment.


173
00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.930
Just a peek.  Please?

174
00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:09.170
What's happening?
Oh my gosh, it's a crow!


175
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.160
You can't come in here!

176
00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:36.100
What got into that bird?
They never behave like that.


177
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:39.380
Maybe it's nesting season
or something.


178
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:48.190
Now l have to replace this screen.
Where do we keep them?


179
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.590
Are you all right?

180
00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.760
Maybe you should take
some of your medicine.


181
00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:56.630
Thanks, Haru.

182
00:37:56.970 --> 00:37:58.460
I feel fine.

183
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:08.770
The nesting season, eh?

184
00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.050
Have yourself
a nice long rest now.


185
00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:20.840
Papa...

186
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:26.850
- I told you to stay away.
- I'm sorry.


187
00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.950
I wanted to do
something to help.


188
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:32.660
But he didn't see me.

189
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.990
You put your family in danger.

190
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:41.070
I won't say it again.
Understand?


191
00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.400
Yes.

192
00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:54.670
We'd better start looking.

193
00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.610
It's time.

194
00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.130
Pod...

195
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.940
You forgot something

196
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.150
Afternoon!  Package for you.

197
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.600
Thanks again ma'am.
It's pretty hot out there.


198
00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.360
Listen, know any good
pest control companies?


199
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.470
Pest control?

200
00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.440
Here's one.  " Squeaky Clean Service. "

201
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.270
Squeaky Clean Service?
Let me just write that down.


202
00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:07.450
Having problems with mice?

203
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:12.650
Maybe it's mice,
or maybe it's something else.


204
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:17.160
Between us, it's little people.

205
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:18.970
I've seen them myself.

206
00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:28.910
A crow tried to
fly into your room?


207
00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.040
I hope it didn't scare you.

208
00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:34.810
Don't worry, Aunt Sadako.
Haru chased it out.


209
00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:38.680
I was so astonished!

210
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.180
I never saw such a huge...

211
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:44.830
Excitement is the worst thing
in the world for his heart.


212
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:48.130
He came here for peace and quiet.

213
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:52.160
If anything were to happen
before the operation...


214
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.490
I know, I know.

215
00:41:56.140 --> 00:42:00.010
I realize his mother's
terribly busy at work.


216
00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.230
But to go abroad on business
and leave a sick child?


217
00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.040
It must be terribly hard for you
without your mother.


218
00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.750
I don't mind.

219
00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.050
I suppose the divorce
couldn't be helped.


220
00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.680
But why can't she be here,
when he needs her so?


221
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.460
Aunt Sadako, who made
that little house in my room?


222
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:32.170
It's amazing.

223
00:42:32.510 --> 00:42:34.410
You mean the doll house?

224
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.700
That doll house
belongs to your mother.


225
00:42:38.050 --> 00:42:41.240
She left there
when she moved out.


226
00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:42.550
It was her?

227
00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:46.850
My father had it
made to order in England.


228
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.620
It was for the little people.

229
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:54.020
My father claimed he'd seen them.

230
00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.230
He waited for so many years.

231
00:42:56.770 --> 00:43:01.400
He always said that house
was a present for them.


232
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:05.440
But I'm afraid they never
showed themselves again.


233
00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:09.730
Not in my father's lifetime,
nor in mine.


234
00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:14.870
Young Master, did you happen to see
any little people in your room?


235
00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:20.410
Unfortunately... no.

236
00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.620
It's been in our family
for four generations.


237
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:29.090
If you like it,
it will be yours someday.


238
00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:30.760
You mean it?

239
00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:32.320
Yes.

240
00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:37.230
Have you looked inside?
It's quite beautiful!


241
00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.440
- Haru, could you turn off the lights?
- Yes.


242
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.120
This is the living room.

243
00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:04.120
All the furnishings were hand made
by a real furniture maker.


244
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.890
Isn't it wonderful?

245
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:13.430
Here's the library on the first floor.
There's even a bathroom.


246
00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.140
But the next room
is my personal favorite.


247
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:20.980
Haru, could you open that up?

248
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.150
Let's see,
I think it opens this way.


249
00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.690
Everything is so detailed!

250
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:34.190
Detailed and just like
the real thing.


251
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:38.460
That's a real oven.
You could use it for baking.


252
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:40.700
Beautiful, just beautiful.

253
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:43.670
What a pity Father's dream
never came true.


254
00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:45.340
And it's been so long...

255
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:48.870
Maybe the little people
are gone now.


256
00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:13.290
Mother, we've had
these pictures three years.


257
00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.810
Don't you want new ones?

258
00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:17.820
I love those pictures.

259
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:21.990
I've a ways dreamed
I'd see the real ocean someday.


260
00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:26.130
Besides, there's no point
changing them now.


261
00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.360
Papa's later than usual.

262
00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:36.540
I hope he didn't get caught
in that downpour.


263
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.020
- Papa?
- That's the back door.


264
00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.350
Papa!  Welcome back...

265
00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.190
Twisted my leg.

266
00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.690
It's lucky Spiller found me.

267
00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:03.030
Pod?

268
00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:07.740
Oh dear, you're hurt!
Hurry.  Bring him in.


269
00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:11.240
Does it hurt?

270
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:14.710
It's not broken.
I'll be fine in no time.


271
00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.050
I'll get some cold water.

272
00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:22.580
Here's a towel, better dry off.

273
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.750
Who's this?

274
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:33.090
It's not just the
three of us after all.


275
00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:42.900
Gotta go.

276
00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.110
Wait, at east stay
and have some tea.


277
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:58.780
I'll see to your father.
Get Spiller a cup of tea.


278
00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.930
Thank you Spiller.
Papa's so lucky you came along.


279
00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:09.790
We're so grateful for your help.

280
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:13.140
Listen, have you seen
other Borrowers?


281
00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:17.300
You see, we thought
we might be the only ones left.


282
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:22.070
This many.

283
00:49:23.350 --> 00:49:25.720
Then Cousin Lupy must be okay?

284
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:29.450
Can I see your bow?

285
00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:37.460
You use this for hunting.

286
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:45.500
Give that back.
It's not a toy.


287
00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:02.850
Gotta go.

288
00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.620
Won't you stay
and have a bite?


289
00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:11.820
Got this.

290
00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:17.030
A cricket's leg!

291
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:20.940
Want some?  It's real good.

292
00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:22.040
No thanks!

293
00:50:26.850 --> 00:50:27.750
Take care.

294
00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:30.880
Thanks again.

295
00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.180
I'll see him out.

296
00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.220
You were looking
for a new place.


297
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:50.430
I tripped and fell.  Couldn't move.
Then Spiller came.


298
00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.200
Really...

299
00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:55.870
His territory reaches past the river.

300
00:50:56.740 --> 00:51:00.610
And he knows a few
places we could live.


301
00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:03.480
That's good I suppose.

302
00:51:04.650 --> 00:51:06.920
I'd hate to camp out.

303
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:12.480
But I doubt we'll find anything
quite as nice as this.


304
00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:19.760
I'm glad there are
still others like us.


305
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:22.870
Do you have friends
and family, Spiller?


306
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.230
Family? No, just me.

307
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:29.270
Well, I hope you
can come again.


308
00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:32.570
My mother's stew
is the best in the world.


309
00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:39.340
Haru?

310
00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.970
Arrietty, your stitches
need to be closer together.


311
00:53:01.170 --> 00:53:02.660
Pull it apart and do it again.

312
00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:08.370
Why do we need
such a big sack anyway?


313
00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.880
I'm going to look in on Papa.

314
00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:23.020
Papa, can I come in?

315
00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:26.990
How's your leg?

316
00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:29.350
I'll be walking soon.

317
00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.690
Papa?

318
00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.990
Are we going to move?

319
00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:40.730
We were seen.
We've no choice but to move.


320
00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:48.310
I don't think every
human being is dangerous.


321
00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:51.080
Arrietty...

322
00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:55.910
Before you were born, there were
two other families living in this house.


323
00:53:56.290 --> 00:53:59.050
One family went missing.
They just disappeared.


324
00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:01.420
The other one moved away.

325
00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.690
They were seen by humans.

326
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:07.600
No matter what happens
we've got to survive.


327
00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.730
Papa...

328
00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:29.680
What in heaven's name!
Is this an earthquake?


329
00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:55.580
Mother!

330
00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.580
It won't open.

331
00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:05.720
The frame's buckled.

332
00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:28.810
The... the wall!

333
00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:06.210
Homily!

334
00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:09.520
Homily!

335
00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.880
I always dreamed
of having a kitchen like this.


336
00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:22.790
Gather only the things we need.

337
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.900
We can't carry all that.

338
00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:36.800
And Homily, take nothing
from the doll house.


339
00:57:39.010 --> 00:57:40.980
I'll make sure it's safe.

340
00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:44.250
- Stay with your mother.
- Yes Papa.


341
00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:18.170
You finally came.

342
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:30.960
Do you like your new kitchen?

343
00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.960
Our house is a disaster.

344
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:40.340
But it doesn't matter.
I came to say goodbye.


345
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:46.880
Can I look?

346
00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:12.670
You're beautiful.

347
00:59:16.110 --> 00:59:18.010
We have to move.

348
00:59:19.210 --> 00:59:20.870
We were seen.

349
00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.750
Borrowers aren't meant to be seen.

350
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:26.250
Borrowers...?

351
00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:28.710
We borrow from human beings.

352
00:59:29.060 --> 00:59:31.350
Things we need.
Things they won't miss.


353
00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.760
Soap and cookies and sugar.
Electricity and gas, too.


354
00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:39.490
Even my great-grandfather
was a Borrower.


355
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:43.100
No one ever saw them?

356
00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:45.100
Probably.

357
00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:50.080
It's all my fault.

358
00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:55.110
Niya, don't be like that.
Be nice to her.


359
00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:00.580
Are there other little people
like you in the house?


360
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:04.620
No, it's just my father
and mother and me.


361
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:06.950
What about in other houses?

362
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:10.960
I'm sure there are some.
I've only met one so far.


363
01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:12.650
Oh.

364
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:17.400
Soon you'll be the only one left.

365
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:21.570
Every year there's fewer of you, right?

366
01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:25.470
You're a doomed species, you know.

367
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:29.280
That's not true!

368
01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:32.850
There's lots more of us.
Spiller said so!


369
01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:34.480
Spiller?

370
01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:36.650
He's one of us.

371
01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:40.160
And he said there's lots more.

372
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:46.220
Do you know how many people
there are in the world?


373
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.330
There are 6.7 billion of us.

374
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.370
Six point seven billion...?

375
01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:55.440
What about you?

376
01:00:56.310 --> 01:00:57.830
I don't know.

377
01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:00.980
There's probably
just a few of you.


378
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:05.340
Until my mom told me,
I didn't know little people existed.


379
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:10.990
Lots of species
are already extinct.


380
01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:14.650
l've only seen them
in books, though.


381
01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:18.130
So many beautiful species...

382
01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:21.960
But the environment changed,
so they died out.


383
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:27.000
It's sad, but that's what fate
has in store for your kind.


384
01:01:28.740 --> 01:01:30.140
Fate, you say?

385
01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:35.370
You're the one who changed things.
Now we have to move away.


386
01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:39.480
We have to survive.
That's what Papa said.


387
01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:42.490
So we're leaving,
even though it's dangerous.


388
01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:48.890
We'll make do, we always have.
You don't know anything about us!


389
01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.590
We're not going
to die out that easily!


390
01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:58.170
I'm sorry.
You're right.


391
01:01:59.170 --> 01:02:01.500
I'm the one
who's going to die.


392
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:08.510
It's my heart.

393
01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.710
They're going to operate
next week, but it's probably hopeless.


394
01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:14.420
Your heart...?

395
01:02:16.590 --> 01:02:20.050
I've always been sick.
I can't play like other kids.


396
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:25.260
From the moment I saw you,
I wanted to protect you.


397
01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:27.760
I can't even do that.

398
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:30.800
I hope you can forgive me.

399
01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:35.310
I didn't know
you were so sick.


400
01:02:59.430 --> 01:03:02.230
What in the world
is this doing here?


401
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.290
It's the kitchen
from the doll house!


402
01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:50.480
Found you!

403
01:03:56.090 --> 01:03:57.280
What's wrong?

404
01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:01.090
My mother... I heard her voice.

405
01:04:32.330 --> 01:04:35.520
This really is a great kitchen.

406
01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:39.130
You're not the only
little one here, I bet.


407
01:05:01.790 --> 01:05:02.720
I have to go.

408
01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:54.010
Let me out! Help me!

409
01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:04.040
The ceiling's tilted.

410
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:33.460
Hello?  Squeaky Clean Service?

411
01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:36.060
Can you make
an urgent house call?


412
01:08:36.370 --> 01:08:39.360
There's something small
in the house.  No, not mice.


413
01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:40.830
<i>Not mice?</i>

414
01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:43.130
I don't want them killed.

415
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:44.840
<i>You need trapping services?</i>

416
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.170
Yes, that's it.
I want you to trap them.


417
01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.780
Sho! Sho!

418
01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:05.660
Arrietty!

419
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.870
Mother's gone!

420
01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:18.000
Someone took the roof off.
I think a human being got her!


421
01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.410
Momma...

422
01:09:35.530 --> 01:09:37.050
We'll find her.

423
01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.990
It's locked.

424
01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:20.200
Let's try the room next door.

425
01:10:40.090 --> 01:10:41.020
Can't budge it.

426
01:10:41.230 --> 01:10:42.420
Wait!

427
01:10:52.810 --> 01:10:53.770
I can fit.

428
01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.310
Amazing!

429
01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:08.180
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

430
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:12.350
There's a dirt road.
Turn in there.


431
01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:15.990
<i>- Before the bridge?
- No, not that one!</i>


432
01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:26.060
Haru opened this.

433
01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.530
Then she must've
taken Mother someplace.


434
01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:07.660
Are you okay?

435
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:20.420
What's taking them so long?

436
01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:56.680
Mother! Where are you?

437
01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.140
But the lock...

438
01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:16.800
Lock?

439
01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:21.480
Could I have
some hot milk?


440
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.510
Okay, wait just a minute.

441
01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:35.330
Thanks.

442
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:16.660
I'm a little hungry.
Are there any cookies?


443
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:24.210
Mother!

444
01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.310
Mother!

445
01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.410
- Mother?
- Arrietty!


446
01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:46.830
Here I am, Arrietty!

447
01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:48.220
Mother!

448
01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.070
Arrietty!

449
01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:25.600
There they are.
They finally found the right road.


450
01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.780
Another human being!

451
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:54.290
It's all right, Mother.

452
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:20.620
We'd like to take a look
around first.


453
01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:22.320
Take your time.

454
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:49.390
Now who can this be?

455
01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:52.650
Haru?  Haru!

456
01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:56.660
What's going on here?

457
01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.690
It's finally happened.
The little people are here!


458
01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.300
Little people?

459
01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:04.660
That's right.

460
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:07.360
And what little thieves they are!

461
01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:22.510
<i>It's really true.</i>

462
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:29.820
They steal from
all over the house.


463
01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:33.160
That's why things
were going missing.


464
01:18:34.270 --> 01:18:36.200
Haru, what's gotten into you?

465
01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:39.430
<i>All these years I thought
it was my imagination.</i>


466
01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:41.570
<i>Well, it wasn't.</i>

467
01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:45.830
You certainly didn't need
to call the exterminators.


468
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:50.340
We'd better hurry.
The house is full of them!


469
01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.350
You'll believe me
when you see this.


470
01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:57.280
This is their nest.

471
01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.750
Nest?

472
01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.430
It looks like a pile
of old junk to me.


473
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:15.600
What? I swear I saw it.

474
01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:19.840
Haru, I'm sending
the exterminators away.


475
01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:22.550
Now, wait just a minute.

476
01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:26.010
The doll house!

477
01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:36.560
Young Master? May we come in
for a minute?


478
01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:37.920
All right.

479
01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:52.710
You won't believe this.
They stole the little kitchen too.


480
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:57.080
You'll see, it's gone.

481
01:20:00.990 --> 01:20:01.950
It's not gone.

482
01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:04.480
Such a pleasure to look at.

483
01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:21.500
Wait, I can prove it!
I have one of them in a jar.


484
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:27.480
I wonder what's gotten into Haru.

485
01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.010
Hmm?

486
01:20:31.450 --> 01:20:33.510
Fresh herbs, how lovely.

487
01:20:48.570 --> 01:20:50.630
Someone was making tea!

488
01:20:52.700 --> 01:20:57.040
It's just as my father said.
There are little people living here.


489
01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:01.540
Yes, there are.

490
01:21:02.610 --> 01:21:04.980
So Haru really saw them.

491
01:21:05.180 --> 01:21:07.650
Though she accused them of stealing.

492
01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:11.380
They're not thieves at all!
They're Borrowers.


493
01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:16.060
I mean, I wish
I could see them.


494
01:21:18.130 --> 01:21:20.560
I bet they're here somewhere.

495
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.560
I'm sure they are.

496
01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:43.450
Excuse me, ma'am!

497
01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:46.220
Where'd you like us to start?

498
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:56.560
Are you alright?

499
01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:01.240
It got away.

500
01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:04.100
I had one and it got away!

501
01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:07.940
It's not just my imagination.
There are little people here!


502
01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.710
Next time I swear
I'll get them!


503
01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:30.470
How far is it to where
we're meeting Spiller?


504
01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:35.140
It's just outside the forest.
Then we head down river.


505
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:41.100
I'm already worn out.
I'll never make it that far.


506
01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:57.960
Let's hurry.

507
01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:00.990
I can't do it...

508
01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:32.000
Better have something to eat.
We'll be walking till morning.


509
01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.300
What?

510
01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.700
I'm so sorry.

511
01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:42.340
It's my fault we had to leave
such a wonderful house.


512
01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:48.200
That's in the past.

513
01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:53.350
We'll make another wonderful house,
the three of us together.


514
01:23:59.390 --> 01:24:01.360
I'm going outside for a bit.

515
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:04.720
Don't go too far, now.

516
01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:41.420
Niya!

517
01:25:51.700 --> 01:25:52.830
Niya...

518
01:26:11.890 --> 01:26:13.480
Just a little further.

519
01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:37.850
Spiller!

520
01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:54.390
That's everything.

521
01:26:55.730 --> 01:26:57.720
Now let's get moving.

522
01:26:58.040 --> 01:26:59.200
Okay.

523
01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:05.870
Mother, are you all right?

524
01:27:18.090 --> 01:27:19.390
Arrietty!

525
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:50.910
Sho!

526
01:27:54.990 --> 01:27:56.260
Arrietty...

527
01:28:15.850 --> 01:28:17.610
We're leaving now.

528
01:28:22.690 --> 01:28:24.480
I'm glad I made it.

529
01:28:28.530 --> 01:28:30.650
Niya showed me the way.

530
01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:41.170
Thanks.  Take care of yourself.

531
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:48.940
I brought this.

532
01:28:54.850 --> 01:28:58.190
I hope you'll accept it this time.

533
01:29:04.030 --> 01:29:05.360
Thank you.

534
01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:21.340
I have to go.

535
01:29:22.750 --> 01:29:24.540
When is your operation?

536
01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:26.850
The day after tomorrow.

537
01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:31.520
I'm going to be okay.
You gave me the courage to live.


538
01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.860
For luck.

539
01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.070
Thanks.

540
01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:57.570
You protected me after all.

541
01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:01.380
Arrietty...

542
01:30:03.860 --> 01:30:06.720
I hope you have
the best life ever.


543
01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:10.590
Goodbye.

544
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:19.060
Arrietty, you're a part
of me now.


545
01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:22.760
I'll never forget you, ever.

546
01:33:51.650 --> 01:33:56.810
A Studio Ghibli Film

547
01:33:59.260 --> 01:34:03.660
