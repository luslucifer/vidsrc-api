00:00:49.196 --> 00:00:50.948
<i>In days of legend,</i>

2
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.284
<i>gods walked the Earth...</i>

3
00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:58.038
<i>and tormented mortals.</i>

4
00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.335
<i>Athena, goddess of warfare and wisdom,</i>

5
00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:07.255
<i>had the power to destroy humanity,</i>

6
00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:09.299
<i>but chose to protect us.</i>

7
00:01:10.342 --> 00:01:13.303
<i>Brave young knights from across the globe</i>

8
00:01:13.387 --> 00:01:15.973
<i>swore their allegiance to her.</i>

9
00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:17.641
<i>They learned to harness Cosmo...</i>

10
00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:21.061
<i>the power of the stars.</i>

11
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:24.898
<i>Their fists cracked to the heavens</i>

12
00:01:24.982 --> 00:01:28.068
<i>in battles against those
who wished Athena dead.</i>


13
00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:33.448
<i>Over time...</i>

14
00:01:34.283 --> 00:01:37.411
<i>the gods retreated and became myths.</i>

15
00:01:38.453 --> 00:01:40.872
<i>But then, 18 years ago,</i>

16
00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:44.960
<i>Athena was reborn as a helpless child.</i>

17
00:01:46.128 --> 00:01:49.631
<i>A knight clad in gold armor</i>

18
00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:53.468
<i>gave his life to protect her
as they crashed to Earth.</i>


19
00:01:55.512 --> 00:01:59.266
<i>And that's how I found her,
lying in his arms.</i>


20
00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.019
<i>A mortal girl with
the power of a god.</i>

21
00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:04.229
<i>Since then,</i>

22
00:02:04.313 --> 00:02:07.941
<i>I've been searching
for a new generation of knights</i>


23
00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:10.611
<i>to protect Athena and the Earth.</i>

24
00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.833
<i>We fight to protect ourselves.</i>

25
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.841
<i>But we also fight to protect each other.</i>

26
00:02:37.596 --> 00:02:40.390
<i>There's always something bigger
than you, Seiya.</i>


27
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:43.769
<i>You'll have to fight
to protect that as well.</i>


28
00:02:50.943 --> 00:02:52.402
You give up?

29
00:02:52.486 --> 00:02:53.487
<i>Never!</i>

30
00:02:56.114 --> 00:02:58.200
Nice try. But not tonight.

31
00:02:58.283 --> 00:02:59.910
-Tap out.
-No!


32
00:02:59.993 --> 00:03:01.662
You must learn when to quit!

33
00:03:01.745 --> 00:03:03.288
Never!

34
00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:09.711
No, Seiya! Don't!

35
00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:13.090
Promise you won't come out.

36
00:03:13.173 --> 00:03:14.091
I promise.

37
00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:26.937
Hey, kid!

38
00:03:28.647 --> 00:03:30.190
Come on, you're up next.

39
00:04:05.142 --> 00:04:07.853
You win this fight,
maybe you get a shot at me someday.


40
00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:10.856
Hey! Listen to me.

41
00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.275
No more of that dancing around,
you understand?


42
00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:15.110
You make it a good show this time.

43
00:04:17.487 --> 00:04:19.156
Fight this time, asshole.

44
00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.783
It's time for the main event!

45
00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:26.121
Introducing first,
the undisputed champion of the Octagon.


46
00:04:26.204 --> 00:04:29.583
Give it up for Jaki the Beast!

47
00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:35.964
<i>Jaki! Jaki! Jaki!</i>

48
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.639
And the contender,
who literally danced his way


49
00:04:43.722 --> 00:04:45.432
through his first two fights,

50
00:04:46.183 --> 00:04:50.187
let's hear it for Street Kid Seiya!

51
00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:57.110
You both know how this works.

52
00:04:59.696 --> 00:05:02.199
You know the rules. 
There are none.

53
00:05:02.282 --> 00:05:04.952
Anything goes until one of you
gives up or blacks out.


54
00:05:06.912 --> 00:05:09.998
If you give up,
you're banished from the Octagon.


55
00:05:10.082 --> 00:05:11.500
Understood?

56
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.105
Damn it, fight!

57
00:05:36.692 --> 00:05:38.777
Hey! I said, no dancing!

58
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:06.763
<i>Cassios! Cassios! Cassios!</i>

59
00:06:06.847 --> 00:06:08.890
What, you think you can just ignore me?

60
00:06:09.725 --> 00:06:11.101
Okay, calm down, big guy.

61
00:06:26.074 --> 00:06:27.492
Ballet's over, kid.

62
00:06:58.398 --> 00:07:00.359
Cassios wins.

63
00:07:00.442 --> 00:07:01.526
Every...

64
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:02.778
single...

65
00:07:02.861 --> 00:07:03.862
time.

66
00:07:09.952 --> 00:07:15.958
<i>Cassios! Cassios! Cassios!</i>

67
00:07:38.397 --> 00:07:39.606
You give up?

68
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:17.811
Yeah!

69
00:08:35.287 --> 00:08:36.788
You don't know when to quit, huh?

70
00:08:38.248 --> 00:08:39.249
Yeah.

71
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.959
I've heard that before.

72
00:08:57.643 --> 00:08:59.269
We're not done here!

73
00:09:03.982 --> 00:09:05.317
This ain't over!

74
00:09:17.037 --> 00:09:18.163
Come outside.

75
00:09:19.414 --> 00:09:22.042
You're cute, but you're not my type, man.

76
00:09:26.171 --> 00:09:30.342
There's someone outside
that wants to speak with you.


77
00:09:30.425 --> 00:09:32.052
He knows about your search.

78
00:09:33.971 --> 00:09:35.681
He knows what you're looking for.

79
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:52.572
Give me that.

80
00:10:00.038 --> 00:10:01.248
Yeah, it's me.

81
00:10:04.167 --> 00:10:06.545
Think I found one of your Cosmo guys.

82
00:10:19.558 --> 00:10:20.559
I'm out of here.

83
00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:25.647
Your little show in there made
some people upset.


84
00:10:25.731 --> 00:10:27.357
Look, I'm not looking for trouble.

85
00:10:27.441 --> 00:10:29.568
You may not be looking,
but you've found it.


86
00:10:30.652 --> 00:10:34.114
In a few moments,
Vander Guraad will be here with her boys.


87
00:10:35.365 --> 00:10:36.366
Who?

88
00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:38.368
My ex-wife.

89
00:10:38.452 --> 00:10:40.078
She controls this fighting ring.

90
00:10:40.162 --> 00:10:42.164
It's her recruitment operation.

91
00:10:43.123 --> 00:10:44.666
What does she recruit?

92
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.461
Warriors with special skills.

93
00:10:47.544 --> 00:10:48.754
For her private army.

94
00:10:50.088 --> 00:10:51.089
Okay.

95
00:10:51.173 --> 00:10:52.841
I saw what you did in the ring.

96
00:10:53.592 --> 00:10:55.802
I knew it had to be you, Seiya.

97
00:10:59.348 --> 00:11:00.349
Who are you?

98
00:11:01.183 --> 00:11:03.101
I'm the only friend you have.

99
00:11:04.853 --> 00:11:06.563
You need to make a choice, Seiya.

100
00:11:06.647 --> 00:11:10.108
Come with me or try your luck
against Guraad's warriors.


101
00:11:16.198 --> 00:11:17.532
Lead the way.

102
00:11:24.748 --> 00:11:25.832
Come on!

103
00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:37.678
Look what we've found.

104
00:11:47.312 --> 00:11:48.647
What are those guys made of?

105
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:50.440
You don't want to know. Keep moving!

106
00:12:04.329 --> 00:12:05.789
Our ride's just around the corner!

107
00:12:11.712 --> 00:12:12.838
Get down!

108
00:12:29.896 --> 00:12:31.064
Go!

109
00:12:33.025 --> 00:12:35.152
Meet Mylock, my assistant.

110
00:12:40.073 --> 00:12:42.200
Those guys work for your ex-wife?

111
00:12:42.784 --> 00:12:44.369
Surrender the boy!

112
00:12:50.042 --> 00:12:51.877
Dude, you gotta make better life choices.

113
00:13:01.094 --> 00:13:02.554
What the hell is that thing?

114
00:13:07.351 --> 00:13:08.852
Hope you had a light dinner.

115
00:13:35.545 --> 00:13:36.546
Why are they after me?

116
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.548
They're after warriors
with a strong Cosmo.


117
00:13:43.762 --> 00:13:45.806
Cosmo? Is that a new martial arts
or something?


118
00:13:46.515 --> 00:13:48.725
You should know.
You tapped into it in the Octagon.


119
00:13:48.809 --> 00:13:51.228
I didn't tap into anything.
They got the wrong guy!


120
00:13:51.311 --> 00:13:53.438
Oh, would you like us to stop
and let them know?


121
00:14:05.867 --> 00:14:06.868
God!

122
00:14:26.263 --> 00:14:27.639
Hold on tight!

123
00:14:46.408 --> 00:14:49.119
I am not going another step
until you tell me what's going on.


124
00:14:49.202 --> 00:14:50.912
There'll be time for that later.

125
00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.123
We're still in danger.

126
00:14:53.206 --> 00:14:54.583
You're really--

127
00:15:00.047 --> 00:15:02.633
<i>Okay, okay, okay. 
Go to sleep.</i>

128
00:15:19.316 --> 00:15:21.234
Hey. Hey. Wake up. Wake up.

129
00:15:22.819 --> 00:15:24.071
Wake up. Come on.

130
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:29.910
You need to hide. No matter what happens,
you stay out of sight.


131
00:15:29.993 --> 00:15:32.412
I have to make sure
these people don't find you.


132
00:15:32.496 --> 00:15:33.956
Promise you won't come out.

133
00:15:34.748 --> 00:15:36.917
Okay. I promise.

134
00:16:05.112 --> 00:16:05.946
Thank you.

135
00:16:06.488 --> 00:16:07.489
For what?

136
00:16:09.783 --> 00:16:11.285
You tapped into your Cosmo.

137
00:16:12.577 --> 00:16:14.913
<i>No, Seiya. Don't!</i>

138
00:16:17.624 --> 00:16:19.584
<i>Led me right to your doorstep.</i>

139
00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:26.466
Saved me so much trouble.

140
00:16:30.304 --> 00:16:31.138
Let's go!

141
00:16:31.847 --> 00:16:32.681
Let's go!

142
00:16:32.764 --> 00:16:35.267
You can't use it. 
Only the Pegasus can!

143
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:36.977
That's why you're coming with us.

144
00:17:02.461 --> 00:17:03.503
Relax.

145
00:17:05.047 --> 00:17:06.464
Relax, we're safe now.

146
00:17:07.424 --> 00:17:08.258
Safe?

147
00:17:08.342 --> 00:17:10.344
First I get attacked by ninja cyborgs,

148
00:17:10.426 --> 00:17:12.095
then I got a spaceship shooting at me.

149
00:17:12.179 --> 00:17:14.347
And then that freak
in a suit drugs me!

150
00:17:14.431 --> 00:17:16.974
Allow me to rephrase it.

151
00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:19.102
You're safer here than with Guraad.

152
00:17:19.185 --> 00:17:21.730
She has already captured
many kids like you,


153
00:17:21.813 --> 00:17:23.022
drained them of their Cosmo.

154
00:17:23.106 --> 00:17:25.232
Stop talking nonsense
and tell me what's going on!


155
00:17:26.068 --> 00:17:27.653
-Prepare for landing.
-What?


156
00:17:27.736 --> 00:17:30.030
You might want to buckle up.

157
00:17:30.113 --> 00:17:31.281
No, I want answers now!

158
00:17:32.074 --> 00:17:33.158
Oh, shit.

159
00:17:40.123 --> 00:17:41.375
There's no runway!

160
00:17:44.628 --> 00:17:46.213
I said, you might want to buckle up.

161
00:17:56.723 --> 00:17:59.226
You couldn't just tell me
this thing lands vertically?


162
00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:07.985
Let's start afresh, shall we?

163
00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.529
My name is Alman Kido.

164
00:18:10.612 --> 00:18:13.323
Once upon a time, 
I was a businessman.

165
00:18:13.407 --> 00:18:15.867
Mylock, let her know our guest
has arrived, please.


166
00:18:15.951 --> 00:18:17.119
Yes, sir.

167
00:18:17.202 --> 00:18:19.204
Should I believe you went bust?

168
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:24.167
I won't hide the fact
I've been quite successful in my trade.


169
00:18:24.251 --> 00:18:27.045
But the one thing
money can't buy is purpose.


170
00:18:27.129 --> 00:18:29.631
So this is where you store your "purpose"?

171
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:31.591
Yes.

172
00:18:34.886 --> 00:18:36.680
Tell me, Seiya, what do you see?

173
00:18:40.142 --> 00:18:41.310
I'm not sure.

174
00:18:41.893 --> 00:18:44.396
A whole bunch of
real old stuff, I guess.

175
00:18:45.522 --> 00:18:47.149
I see stories.

176
00:18:47.232 --> 00:18:51.820
Ancient heroes were defined
by their monumental deeds


177
00:18:51.903 --> 00:18:53.947
as much as by their tragic ends.

178
00:18:54.781 --> 00:18:59.328
I always admired
the formidable magnitude of their fate.


179
00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:05.250
I envied it. I used to think
the ancient lore held no secret for me.


180
00:19:07.085 --> 00:19:08.587
I'm afraid that was my hubris.

181
00:19:10.547 --> 00:19:12.424
What do you know about Athena?

182
00:19:12.507 --> 00:19:15.552
-She was a god of war.
-And wisdom.


183
00:19:15.636 --> 00:19:18.722
What if I told you
Athena had returned in human form


184
00:19:18.805 --> 00:19:23.101
and you are destined
to become one of her guardian knights?


185
00:19:23.185 --> 00:19:25.562
I'd say your therapist isn't worth
his paycheck.


186
00:19:26.939 --> 00:19:29.358
Things happen for a reason, Seiya.

187
00:19:29.441 --> 00:19:31.151
Your Cosmo brought you here.

188
00:19:31.234 --> 00:19:33.695
Actually, I was brought here
on a very expensive aircraft.


189
00:19:34.446 --> 00:19:36.448
And now I'm leaving
on my own two feet.

190
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.661
You know the truth in your heart, Seiya.

191
00:19:40.744 --> 00:19:42.245
Your sister knew it too.

192
00:19:51.004 --> 00:19:52.756
What do you know about my sister?

193
00:19:52.839 --> 00:19:56.843
Ten years ago,
Guraad detected a strong Cosmo


194
00:19:56.927 --> 00:19:59.054
at your location.
She thought it was Patricia.


195
00:19:59.137 --> 00:20:00.472
What did she do to her?

196
00:20:00.555 --> 00:20:03.767
I don't know,
but your sister gave herself up


197
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.144
so that Guraad wouldn't find you.

198
00:20:06.228 --> 00:20:08.814
She knew what you were to become.

199
00:20:08.897 --> 00:20:11.733
A warrior of Athena. 
The Pegasus Knight.

200
00:20:12.276 --> 00:20:13.527
The Pegasus Knight?

201
00:20:14.361 --> 00:20:15.946
You're really out of your mind.

202
00:20:17.197 --> 00:20:18.949
That doesn't bode well.

203
00:20:19.032 --> 00:20:20.284
This is Sienna.

204
00:20:21.743 --> 00:20:23.996
Guraad is after her too.

205
00:20:24.079 --> 00:20:25.497
Your mission is to protect her.

206
00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:27.374
I can take care of myself.

207
00:20:27.457 --> 00:20:30.127
Why would I ever want
to risk my neck to protect some rich girl?


208
00:20:31.211 --> 00:20:35.173
Because our little Sienna here is
the reincarnation of the goddess Athena.


209
00:20:35.257 --> 00:20:38.302
-Dad.
-Don't you have something for our guest?


210
00:20:38.385 --> 00:20:40.804
Sure, a toilet,
so he can flush himself out.


211
00:20:40.887 --> 00:20:43.181
Wow, spoken like a true goddess.

212
00:20:43.265 --> 00:20:47.227
Dad, come on. This moron can't
seriously be the Pegasus Knight.


213
00:20:48.937 --> 00:20:49.938
Go on.

214
00:20:53.609 --> 00:20:54.735
Fine.

215
00:20:54.818 --> 00:20:57.029
You might recognize this, Seiya.

216
00:21:11.418 --> 00:21:12.502
This is Patricia's.

217
00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.089
That is the key to the Pegasus armor.

218
00:21:16.173 --> 00:21:19.092
Without it, you don't stand a chance
against Guraad's army.


219
00:21:19.176 --> 00:21:20.469
I could've handled those guys.

220
00:21:20.552 --> 00:21:22.054
That's not what Mylock said.

221
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.143
So how's this supposed
to help me find my sister?


222
00:21:28.226 --> 00:21:30.687
You give me a little present
and expect me to help you out?


223
00:21:30.771 --> 00:21:32.773
My plan is to trust you
to do what is right.


224
00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:34.066
And what would that be?

225
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:37.444
I suppose you've never heard of Marin,
the Silver Knight.


226
00:21:37.527 --> 00:21:39.279
God, another one of your old legends?

227
00:21:39.363 --> 00:21:41.657
Marin can teach you how to reveal

228
00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.325
the hidden secret of the pendant.

229
00:21:43.408 --> 00:21:46.370
So you can protect Sienna,
and yourself, against your enemies.


230
00:21:46.453 --> 00:21:48.538
And maybe even help you find your sister.

231
00:21:48.622 --> 00:21:50.290
Ancient gods. Magic knights.

232
00:21:50.374 --> 00:21:52.876
Do you have any idea
how totally insane you sound?


233
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.505
I know, it is a
lot to take in, isn't it?

234
00:21:56.588 --> 00:22:00.425
So why don't we have breakfast,
take the day off and...


235
00:22:01.385 --> 00:22:03.553
revisit this tomorrow. Yeah.

236
00:22:07.057 --> 00:22:08.767
Well, I am hungry, but...

237
00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:10.811
A goddess's fate is
on the line, but sure.

238
00:22:10.894 --> 00:22:12.896
Let's eat pancakes.

239
00:22:14.481 --> 00:22:15.315
Yeah.

240
00:22:25.993 --> 00:22:27.911
Get off my ring, you scum.

241
00:22:28.662 --> 00:22:29.871
Get out of my ring!

242
00:22:31.373 --> 00:22:32.958
You moron.

243
00:22:33.041 --> 00:22:35.002
You were supposed to keep a low profile.

244
00:22:35.711 --> 00:22:36.920
And I did.

245
00:22:37.004 --> 00:22:39.214
We need to shut this place down.

246
00:22:39.298 --> 00:22:42.718
-You don't get to decide that!
-That's right. I do.


247
00:22:42.801 --> 00:22:44.386
Guraad, come on.

248
00:22:45.137 --> 00:22:46.596
We have a great partnership.

249
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:48.515
Yes. We did.

250
00:22:49.641 --> 00:22:51.560
How's the boy's Cosmo?

251
00:22:51.643 --> 00:22:52.978
It's legit.

252
00:22:53.061 --> 00:22:56.064
Good news. I've got
a new deal for you.

253
00:22:56.648 --> 00:22:58.817
No ring, no deal.

254
00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.776
All the better.

255
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.654
Nobody needs a loser who gets
his ass kicked by a scrawny kid.


256
00:23:02.738 --> 00:23:04.740
He got a lucky break.

257
00:23:04.823 --> 00:23:06.992
No man gets lucky twice with Cassios.

258
00:23:07.075 --> 00:23:09.578
I can beat anyone, anytime.

259
00:23:09.661 --> 00:23:11.038
Well, let's see if that's true.

260
00:23:29.181 --> 00:23:30.182
Something wrong?

261
00:23:33.852 --> 00:23:36.772
I just don't know how you can breathe
while you're eating like that.


262
00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:44.154
Where I come from, you eat
as much as you can, when you can.


263
00:23:45.948 --> 00:23:48.158
You never know
where your next meal's coming from.


264
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.372
You wouldn't understand.

265
00:23:56.166 --> 00:23:57.167
Rich girl.

266
00:23:59.962 --> 00:24:01.338
No, I wouldn't.

267
00:24:02.589 --> 00:24:04.299
But I'm sorry you
had to live like that.

268
00:24:09.596 --> 00:24:12.099
Sir. There's an urgent call.

269
00:24:13.725 --> 00:24:15.060
Please excuse me.

270
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.321
So...

271
00:24:27.948 --> 00:24:29.783
How does it feel to be a goddess?

272
00:24:32.452 --> 00:24:35.622
Well, I'm not a goddess yet.

273
00:24:36.832 --> 00:24:38.000
Just Sienna.

274
00:24:38.083 --> 00:24:40.877
But her Cosmo is getting stronger
by the day,


275
00:24:40.961 --> 00:24:43.547
and someday soon I will become Athena.

276
00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.679
Most people would be excited

277
00:24:51.471 --> 00:24:53.390
to have breakfast with a future goddess.

278
00:24:56.351 --> 00:24:57.769
Guess I'm not most people, then.

279
00:24:59.479 --> 00:25:01.231
Well, then maybe you should--

280
00:25:04.901 --> 00:25:06.320
Maybe I should what?

281
00:25:13.785 --> 00:25:15.078
You should back off.

282
00:25:15.787 --> 00:25:17.080
Jeez, don't be so sensitive.

283
00:25:19.249 --> 00:25:20.542
Just get away from me, okay?

284
00:25:20.626 --> 00:25:22.169
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-Just get away--


285
00:25:30.886 --> 00:25:31.720
Hey!

286
00:25:33.764 --> 00:25:35.223
Dad!

287
00:25:35.766 --> 00:25:36.642
Hey!

288
00:25:37.267 --> 00:25:39.227
-Are you okay?
-Wait!


289
00:25:43.065 --> 00:25:44.441
What's going on?

290
00:25:45.108 --> 00:25:46.818
She could kill you right now.

291
00:25:47.319 --> 00:25:49.488
I'm here, sweetheart, just relax.

292
00:25:57.788 --> 00:25:58.914
What just happened?

293
00:26:03.543 --> 00:26:06.546
She bears a goddess's Cosmo
in the body of a mortal.


294
00:26:13.428 --> 00:26:17.224
When our sensors detect
a potential Cosmo burst,


295
00:26:17.933 --> 00:26:20.602
the building automatically
blocks the signal.


296
00:26:21.687 --> 00:26:24.940
It's the only way we can keep
Sienna hidden from Guraad.


297
00:26:25.023 --> 00:26:27.859
Which is why I am stuck here
like a prisoner.


298
00:26:32.114 --> 00:26:33.115
Excuse me.

299
00:26:34.533 --> 00:26:37.327
Wait. Wait, so... 
So you really are...?

300
00:26:48.297 --> 00:26:50.841
You really think this guy could beat
the Pegasus Knight?


301
00:26:51.466 --> 00:26:54.094
Perhaps. If we give him the prototype.

302
00:27:07.649 --> 00:27:09.151
Next candidate?

303
00:27:13.655 --> 00:27:14.656
You giving up already?

304
00:27:25.584 --> 00:27:27.377
What the hell are you made of?

305
00:27:28.795 --> 00:27:29.755
Disengage.

306
00:27:34.468 --> 00:27:35.927
We ain't done yet.

307
00:27:41.475 --> 00:27:43.810
You made your point, Cassios.

308
00:27:43.894 --> 00:27:45.187
You're a strong man.

309
00:27:45.896 --> 00:27:48.231
But you're just a man.

310
00:27:53.403 --> 00:27:54.696
I have a problem.

311
00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:56.490
You met him in your ring.

312
00:27:57.324 --> 00:27:58.158
The kid.

313
00:27:58.241 --> 00:28:00.077
His power's a liability.

314
00:28:00.744 --> 00:28:04.539
Once he learns to control it,
no living man will be able to stop him.


315
00:28:05.624 --> 00:28:07.584
What, you think I could, though?

316
00:28:08.293 --> 00:28:10.629
You know, with your prototype thing?

317
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:12.631
I have a good ear.

318
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.925
So, what's your price?

319
00:28:17.302 --> 00:28:18.553
Well, that depends.

320
00:28:19.805 --> 00:28:20.973
Can I kill him?

321
00:28:21.056 --> 00:28:22.724
That's kind of the point.

322
00:28:23.725 --> 00:28:25.060
I'll do it for free.

323
00:28:51.044 --> 00:28:53.338
-You all right?
-I'm better.


324
00:28:54.506 --> 00:28:57.426
-You?
-I'm good. I guess.


325
00:28:59.303 --> 00:29:01.972
It's just that I can't believe
you really are a--


326
00:29:02.055 --> 00:29:03.056
A goddess?

327
00:29:05.183 --> 00:29:06.977
I'm never gonna call you that.

328
00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.770
That's fine with me.

329
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:14.026
So how do people usually react
when they learn you're Athena?


330
00:29:14.818 --> 00:29:15.652
Varies.

331
00:29:16.612 --> 00:29:19.531
Like, the day after I was born,
someone tried to kill me.


332
00:29:19.615 --> 00:29:20.616
No.

333
00:29:22.492 --> 00:29:25.621
Not even you could annoy someone
that much in just one day.


334
00:29:26.538 --> 00:29:29.833
I was told a knight in gold armor
gave his life to save mine.


335
00:29:31.293 --> 00:29:33.712
When they found him,
he was still holding me in his arms.


336
00:29:33.795 --> 00:29:35.797
Who found you? Alman?

337
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.841
And Guraad.

338
00:29:40.302 --> 00:29:42.804
Though she was a little more
into the gold armor.


339
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.559
Used it to develop technology
far beyond anything you could imagine.


340
00:29:48.935 --> 00:29:49.978
Look at the bright side.

341
00:29:51.229 --> 00:29:53.065
Half your foster family is great.

342
00:29:54.358 --> 00:29:56.985
When Alman's around you,
he almost looks like a real dad.


343
00:29:58.445 --> 00:30:01.698
Alman is my dad, and I love him
more than anything in the world.


344
00:30:03.325 --> 00:30:07.204
Although that might be hard
for you to understand, street boy.


345
00:30:08.747 --> 00:30:09.748
I do.

346
00:30:12.793 --> 00:30:14.628
I had someone like that once.

347
00:30:16.338 --> 00:30:17.339
Your sister?

348
00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.301
What was she like?

349
00:30:23.261 --> 00:30:24.721
She was kind.

350
00:30:26.848 --> 00:30:28.058
<i>And strong.</i>

351
00:30:29.393 --> 00:30:31.937
And protected me
when I couldn't protect myself.


352
00:30:33.355 --> 00:30:35.315
And you won't stop until you find her.

353
00:30:35.399 --> 00:30:38.360
You really don't care that I've become
your bodyguard, do you?


354
00:30:39.111 --> 00:30:41.321
I will someday become Athena.

355
00:30:42.197 --> 00:30:43.615
I don't have a choice.

356
00:30:43.699 --> 00:30:46.368
But that doesn't mean you have
to become the Pegasus Knight.


357
00:30:46.451 --> 00:30:48.120
Alman said it's my destiny.

358
00:30:48.203 --> 00:30:50.205
Nobody's destiny is written in stone.

359
00:30:51.707 --> 00:30:52.791
Except yours.

360
00:30:54.334 --> 00:30:56.169
Your Cosmo bursts,

361
00:30:56.253 --> 00:30:58.005
do they come with visions?

362
00:30:58.714 --> 00:31:00.048
You have visions too?

363
00:31:00.132 --> 00:31:01.300
What does it matter?

364
00:31:01.383 --> 00:31:05.554
Cosmo visions are a window
into the universe.


365
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.181
They can show us things.

366
00:31:11.518 --> 00:31:14.187
So that Silver Knight
your dad mentioned...?


367
00:31:14.271 --> 00:31:15.897
-Who, Marin?
-Marin.


368
00:31:15.981 --> 00:31:18.525
Do you think if he could teach me
to control my Cosmo,


369
00:31:18.609 --> 00:31:20.235
I could use it to find my sister?

370
00:31:21.236 --> 00:31:22.279
Maybe.

371
00:31:24.406 --> 00:31:25.616
If that's what you want.

372
00:32:00.651 --> 00:32:02.945
He's drained of Cosmo, Guraad.

373
00:32:06.239 --> 00:32:07.783
Won't get another dose.

374
00:32:09.952 --> 00:32:12.496
The prototype procedure has started.

375
00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:14.581
It'll be ready tomorrow.

376
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:16.375
Any issues?

377
00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.001
Just one.

378
00:32:18.919 --> 00:32:20.253
Why Cassios?

379
00:32:21.046 --> 00:32:22.464
'Cause you failed.

380
00:32:24.633 --> 00:32:28.095
You know, the target was assisted
by Alman Kido.


381
00:32:28.178 --> 00:32:30.138
A personal bad penny.

382
00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.725
Athena's growing stronger by the day,

383
00:32:33.809 --> 00:32:36.645
and now she'll have
the Pegasus Knight by her side.


384
00:32:36.728 --> 00:32:40.732
I reckon the boy's got some Cosmo.
Doesn't mean he's a knight yet.


385
00:32:40.816 --> 00:32:42.734
I don't need cold comfort, Nero.

386
00:32:42.818 --> 00:32:45.487
I need to know where on Earth
Alman is hiding the girl.


387
00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:48.115
So we can neutralize her
before she becomes Athena


388
00:32:48.198 --> 00:32:49.574
and destroys the world.

389
00:32:51.159 --> 00:32:52.202
Beats me.

390
00:32:54.121 --> 00:32:56.081
But you could always ask our prisoner.

391
00:32:59.126 --> 00:33:00.294
We have a prisoner?

392
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:37.664
Hey!

393
00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:39.666
Hey, wait up.

394
00:33:40.417 --> 00:33:41.460
Yeah?

395
00:33:42.711 --> 00:33:46.506
I... I just figured you could focus more
on your training if you weren't


396
00:33:46.590 --> 00:33:49.092
worried about where your next meal
was coming from.


397
00:33:50.761 --> 00:33:51.595
Thanks.

398
00:33:59.269 --> 00:34:00.395
Thank you.

399
00:34:01.897 --> 00:34:02.898
I guess.

400
00:34:05.776 --> 00:34:06.777
Seiya!

401
00:34:07.694 --> 00:34:08.820
Time to go.

402
00:34:11.657 --> 00:34:12.658
See you.

403
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:16.869
Take a seat.

404
00:34:21.667 --> 00:34:23.418
Don't get any big ideas.

405
00:34:24.336 --> 00:34:27.714
Goddesses don't have boyfriends.

406
00:34:27.798 --> 00:34:29.675
-How many dads does Sienna have?
-Buckle up.


407
00:34:40.018 --> 00:34:41.019
Lunchbox?

408
00:34:42.896 --> 00:34:44.606
That's unusually kind of you.

409
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.069
I just thought
he might as well enjoy his last meal,


410
00:34:49.152 --> 00:34:51.362
since Marin's probably
gonna kill him anyway.


411
00:34:52.864 --> 00:34:53.865
Right.

412
00:35:16.638 --> 00:35:18.557
So where am I supposed to go?

413
00:35:25.397 --> 00:35:27.232
Okay. Just drop me off up there.

414
00:35:27.316 --> 00:35:28.817
Not how it works.

415
00:35:47.878 --> 00:35:51.632
"Those who seek the master
must do so on foot."


416
00:36:21.578 --> 00:36:23.497
What the hell am I doing here?

417
00:36:24.623 --> 00:36:26.416
I was wondering the same thing.

418
00:36:39.846 --> 00:36:42.015
You must be Marin.

419
00:36:42.849 --> 00:36:44.977
-The Silver Knight.
-You look surprised.


420
00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.354
Yeah. No, I'm... I mean...

421
00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.357
No offense, I thought you'd be a man.

422
00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.900
No offense taken.

423
00:36:51.984 --> 00:36:53.527
I thought the same of you.

424
00:36:55.195 --> 00:36:57.239
What's the training schedule like here?

425
00:36:57.322 --> 00:36:59.449
I only train knights.

426
00:37:01.576 --> 00:37:03.495
I'm told I'm the Pegasus Knight.

427
00:37:05.247 --> 00:37:08.292
You're not the first boy
with a pretty necklace to show up here.


428
00:37:09.459 --> 00:37:11.169
Is there a test
I can take or something?

429
00:37:15.841 --> 00:37:17.759
The Pegasus Knight is brave.

430
00:37:20.721 --> 00:37:21.555
Check.

431
00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:23.390
Humble.

432
00:37:23.473 --> 00:37:24.641
Check.

433
00:37:24.725 --> 00:37:27.811
And committed
to protecting Athena with his life.


434
00:37:28.729 --> 00:37:32.357
Okay, that's where this whole situation
gets a little sticky.


435
00:37:32.441 --> 00:37:33.900
See, I lost my sister-
- Hey!

436
00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:36.778
I just got up here!

437
00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.033
I just got up here.

438
00:37:44.661 --> 00:37:45.912
I'm not going down there.

439
00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:18.695
There's nothing for you here.

440
00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:20.781
What are you? Like, a ninja?

441
00:38:23.951 --> 00:38:26.912
Listen, I only wanna find my sister.
Sienna said you could help.


442
00:38:26.995 --> 00:38:29.456
I knew a knight just like you.

443
00:38:29.539 --> 00:38:31.458
He desired power for his own goals.

444
00:38:31.541 --> 00:38:33.543
-Which was?
-The Phoenix.


445
00:38:33.627 --> 00:38:35.712
The most powerful of Athena's knights.

446
00:38:35.796 --> 00:38:37.839
You mean, aside from the Pegasus Knight.

447
00:38:40.258 --> 00:38:42.135
I'll have Mylock come get you
in the morning.


448
00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:43.887
No. Come on, I made it this far.

449
00:38:43.971 --> 00:38:45.305
And how far is that?

450
00:38:46.223 --> 00:38:47.933
Do you even know how
far you need to go?

451
00:38:48.642 --> 00:38:50.268
Just give me one chance.

452
00:38:56.358 --> 00:38:57.859
If you can break this rock...

453
00:38:58.986 --> 00:39:01.113
then you can be my student.

454
00:39:09.871 --> 00:39:10.872
Fair enough.

455
00:39:11.832 --> 00:39:13.041
Where's the hammer?

456
00:39:15.961 --> 00:39:18.088
Come on, I can't break a rock
with my bare hands.


457
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.007
A knight could.

458
00:39:21.967 --> 00:39:23.343
You can't be serious.

459
00:39:26.972 --> 00:39:28.515
You're serious.

460
00:39:44.323 --> 00:39:45.991
I told you, this was stupid!

461
00:39:50.162 --> 00:39:53.999
Your flesh, this rock,
the stars in the sky,


462
00:39:54.082 --> 00:39:58.045
all things in the cosmos are made
from the same atoms.


463
00:39:58.128 --> 00:40:02.382
From the moment we are born,
we all hold a Cosmo within ourselves.


464
00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:05.218
A knight can make it explode.

465
00:40:05.802 --> 00:40:09.806
And shatter the atoms of any object.

466
00:40:14.686 --> 00:40:16.813
How's that supposed to make any sense?

467
00:40:20.484 --> 00:40:21.485
Focus.

468
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.738
Clear your mind.

469
00:40:25.322 --> 00:40:27.366
Feel the Cosmo within you.

470
00:41:03.151 --> 00:41:04.111
<i>Seiya!</i>

471
00:41:08.156 --> 00:41:09.908
This is stupid, it'll never work!

472
00:41:09.992 --> 00:41:11.952
Something clouded your focus
at the last minute.


473
00:41:12.035 --> 00:41:14.746
Figures. Guess I'm not
the Pegasus Knight after all.


474
00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:16.832
No, you're not.

475
00:41:16.915 --> 00:41:19.084
But maybe you will be.

476
00:41:20.335 --> 00:41:22.087
Are you ready to start your training?

477
00:41:38.937 --> 00:41:41.982
It's a good thing he didn't mind
the permanent changes to his body.


478
00:41:42.065 --> 00:41:44.318
-Well...
-What?


479
00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:47.404
I might have forgotten to mention
the permanent part to him.


480
00:41:59.708 --> 00:42:00.876
What the hell is this?

481
00:42:00.959 --> 00:42:02.628
What did you do? You made--

482
00:42:03.295 --> 00:42:05.922
You made me a freaking cyborg!

483
00:42:16.266 --> 00:42:17.768
What is that?

484
00:42:17.851 --> 00:42:19.353
It's the curse of Athena.

485
00:42:21.313 --> 00:42:24.232
The war that awaits us is unlike
any other before.


486
00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:27.486
Our enemies are the gods themselves.

487
00:42:28.695 --> 00:42:30.530
We've all made sacrifices.

488
00:42:32.741 --> 00:42:37.329
But what is flesh in comparison
to the power to crush the immortals?


489
00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:44.169
A war with the gods, huh?

490
00:42:44.252 --> 00:42:46.630
There's only one person I wanna crush.

491
00:42:50.092 --> 00:42:51.802
Well, that was a nice little show.

492
00:42:51.885 --> 00:42:54.179
Let's move on.
We have bigger issues at hand.


493
00:42:54.262 --> 00:42:55.889
-Bigger than his ego?
-Your prisoner.


494
00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:58.475
He's a tough one. 
I can't get him to talk.

495
00:42:58.558 --> 00:43:01.395
-Any ideas?
-Have you tried asking nicely?


496
00:43:09.152 --> 00:43:10.487
Let's get a baseline.

497
00:43:22.374 --> 00:43:24.084
Show me what you know.

498
00:43:24.167 --> 00:43:26.586
You mean, fight you? Now?

499
00:43:33.093 --> 00:43:34.636
You came here to train, yes?

500
00:43:40.058 --> 00:43:42.311
Is dancing all you can do?

501
00:44:11.381 --> 00:44:13.175
Shouldn't I have a weapon or something?

502
00:44:13.258 --> 00:44:15.093
Athena's knights wield no weapon.

503
00:44:15.761 --> 00:44:16.803
That sucks.

504
00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:46.959
Okay, I felt that one.

505
00:44:47.042 --> 00:44:48.710
It wasn't a direct hit.

506
00:44:56.093 --> 00:44:57.594
How the hell'd you do that?

507
00:44:57.678 --> 00:44:59.304
You want a weapon?

508
00:44:59.388 --> 00:45:01.390
Your Cosmo is your weapon.

509
00:45:01.473 --> 00:45:03.266
Focus your energy,

510
00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:05.477
let it burn inside of you.

511
00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.437
Release it all at once.

512
00:45:07.521 --> 00:45:08.563
Like a shooting star.

513
00:45:09.356 --> 00:45:11.275
Felt more like a meteor shower to me.

514
00:45:16.989 --> 00:45:19.866
So do I get to learn
this meteor fist of yours?


515
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.951
You must...

516
00:45:21.493 --> 00:45:24.204
if you want to survive
the battles that await you.


517
00:46:31.647 --> 00:46:32.648
Sienna!

518
00:46:37.402 --> 00:46:38.946
It's all right. 
It's all right.

519
00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:40.614
It's all right. 
It's all right.

520
00:46:40.697 --> 00:46:42.324
I'm here. It's all right.

521
00:46:44.743 --> 00:46:47.621
I had another vision. Bad one.

522
00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:50.290
It's okay, it's all gone now.

523
00:46:50.916 --> 00:46:51.750
Dad...

524
00:46:53.627 --> 00:46:56.380
How can you be so sure
I'll grow up to protect the world?


525
00:46:56.463 --> 00:46:58.840
You are the goddess of wisdom, remember?

526
00:46:58.924 --> 00:46:59.967
And warfare.

527
00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.261
And you're my baby girl.

528
00:47:03.971 --> 00:47:06.306
The most loving and stubborn.

529
00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:09.101
Nothing could stop you
from doing what's right.


530
00:47:09.184 --> 00:47:10.644
What did you see?

531
00:47:12.896 --> 00:47:15.107
People... burning.

532
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:16.942
Cities in ruins.

533
00:47:17.693 --> 00:47:19.152
Everything...

534
00:47:20.529 --> 00:47:21.822
destroyed.

535
00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:23.907
We won't let that happen, will we?

536
00:47:23.991 --> 00:47:26.118
You don't understand. 
It was Athena.

537
00:47:26.201 --> 00:47:27.786
She was doing it. I...

538
00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:30.289
I was doing it.

539
00:47:31.123 --> 00:47:34.584
Visions are just... possibilities.

540
00:47:34.668 --> 00:47:37.504
Dad, I know you'd let
the world burn to keep me safe...


541
00:47:39.339 --> 00:47:41.383
but what if that's not me anymore?

542
00:47:56.064 --> 00:47:58.275
Prove to me you're worthy. Focus.

543
00:48:02.738 --> 00:48:03.947
Is that all you've got?

544
00:48:06.199 --> 00:48:07.326
Your body is here.

545
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.078
But your mind is elsewhere.

546
00:48:18.545 --> 00:48:19.504
<i>Seiya.</i>

547
00:48:19.588 --> 00:48:21.715
There's so many things
I need to tell you.

548
00:48:21.798 --> 00:48:23.467
I'm here to protect you.

549
00:48:25.177 --> 00:48:26.595
Now stop my attack.

550
00:48:35.395 --> 00:48:36.647
You're failing.

551
00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:41.902
Was he a knight too?

552
00:48:41.985 --> 00:48:43.362
The Pegasus?

553
00:48:44.029 --> 00:48:47.616
Mind and body must become one.

554
00:48:51.286 --> 00:48:53.830
A knight's power comes from within.

555
00:49:04.925 --> 00:49:06.385
You give up?

556
00:49:10.472 --> 00:49:13.266
If you can't do this,
you'll never be a knight.


557
00:49:24.903 --> 00:49:25.904
You give up?

558
00:50:11.199 --> 00:50:12.993
How did you say
you ended up here, again?

559
00:50:13.827 --> 00:50:15.829
I didn't say. And it's none of your--

560
00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:18.040
Right, I'm not supposed to know. I know.

561
00:50:20.208 --> 00:50:23.253
My destiny is bound to this island.

562
00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:26.131
Well, that sounds like a lonely existence.

563
00:50:26.214 --> 00:50:27.924
But not one without purpose.

564
00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:29.593
You know, I...

565
00:50:30.594 --> 00:50:32.179
I have a purpose too.

566
00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:33.805
To find my sister.

567
00:50:33.889 --> 00:50:37.267
A knight should not mistake
obsession for purpose.


568
00:50:38.018 --> 00:50:40.062
I know there is pain in your past...

569
00:50:40.771 --> 00:50:43.941
but beyond that pain,
there lies your strength.


570
00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:47.861
Find it and the armor will accept you.

571
00:50:48.862 --> 00:50:50.864
This is what your sister would've wanted.

572
00:50:52.741 --> 00:50:53.909
Get some sleep.

573
00:52:44.603 --> 00:52:46.480
I get it.

574
00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:48.398
You're tough.

575
00:52:49.149 --> 00:52:53.153
You know, someone once taught me

576
00:52:53.236 --> 00:52:56.114
that all men, no matter how tough,

577
00:52:57.491 --> 00:52:58.992
have something they fear.

578
00:53:06.375 --> 00:53:09.753
I wonder what it is
a big man like you fears the most.


579
00:53:28.772 --> 00:53:30.190
Who are you?

580
00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:38.115
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

581
00:53:40.784 --> 00:53:42.119
Make it stop.

582
00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:47.457
Make it stop!

583
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.334
Make it go away.

584
00:53:50.752 --> 00:53:51.586
Now...

585
00:53:52.838 --> 00:53:56.091
would you mind telling me
where I can find Alman Kido?


586
00:53:57.342 --> 00:53:58.719
Make it stop!

587
00:54:05.309 --> 00:54:09.146
-This one's bigger than the last one.
-And your Cosmo is stronger.


588
00:54:09.229 --> 00:54:11.189
Now, show me what you've learned.

589
00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:40.153
You did it, Seiya.

590
00:55:41.405 --> 00:55:43.198
The Pegasus armor is--

591
00:55:56.878 --> 00:56:00.090
You can't use it. 
Only the Pegasus can.

592
00:56:00.173 --> 00:56:01.883
That's why you're coming with us.

593
00:56:13.186 --> 00:56:14.021
Alman.

594
00:56:15.439 --> 00:56:16.815
He was a part of it.

595
00:56:18.317 --> 00:56:21.653
He was there when Guraad took Patricia.

596
00:56:26.241 --> 00:56:27.909
I want off this island.

597
00:56:30.787 --> 00:56:32.039
You are not ready.

598
00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:34.041
Your training is not over.

599
00:56:35.417 --> 00:56:36.585
It is now.

600
00:56:47.346 --> 00:56:49.473
Alman's been playing me for a fool!

601
00:56:49.556 --> 00:56:51.099
You must calm down.

602
00:56:51.183 --> 00:56:54.227
If your heart and mind aren't clear,
the armor will reject you.


603
00:56:54.311 --> 00:56:55.812
To hell with the armor!

604
00:57:26.969 --> 00:57:27.970
Seiya.

605
00:57:29.221 --> 00:57:30.430
I don't care.

606
00:57:32.057 --> 00:57:33.767
You can either kill me now...

607
00:57:36.645 --> 00:57:37.938
or send me back.

608
00:57:44.236 --> 00:57:46.071
Let's go. One more round, guys.

609
00:57:47.114 --> 00:57:48.115
Come on.

610
00:57:55.831 --> 00:57:57.165
How's it coming along?

611
00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:02.337
You want this to work, 
I need more time.

612
00:58:04.256 --> 00:58:05.924
Be careful, you idiot!

613
00:58:11.388 --> 00:58:15.475
Yeah, running out of sparring partners.
You care to join?


614
00:58:15.559 --> 00:58:17.436
Oh, I'm sorry. Busy day.

615
00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:23.609
Right, right. You're playing
with your god-killing toy over here.


616
00:58:24.943 --> 00:58:25.944
Yeah.

617
00:58:27.362 --> 00:58:29.656
So much trouble for one little girl.

618
00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:31.366
You know, if you ask me,

619
00:58:31.450 --> 00:58:35.078
I'd be more than happy to snap her neck
the old-fashioned way.


620
00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:42.252
Any damage to Sienna's body
might awaken Athena's Cosmo within her.


621
00:58:42.336 --> 00:58:45.005
Yeah, I don't even know what that means.

622
00:58:45.631 --> 00:58:49.676
It means you can't dismantle
a nuclear bomb by smashing it with a club.


623
00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:52.387
I'd sure love to try.

624
00:58:53.722 --> 00:58:55.098
It's not happening.

625
00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.726
Make it work.

626
00:59:06.485 --> 00:59:07.653
Alman!

627
00:59:07.736 --> 00:59:09.196
I know what you did!

628
00:59:10.072 --> 00:59:12.991
-Come face me, you coward.
-Stand down!


629
00:59:13.825 --> 00:59:15.118
I'll handle this.

630
00:59:15.744 --> 00:59:17.579
-Seiya, please.
-Alman!


631
00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:19.665
Please calm down.

632
00:59:19.748 --> 00:59:20.958
Stand back!

633
00:59:21.959 --> 00:59:23.543
You can't hide from me.

634
00:59:24.252 --> 00:59:25.253
Seiya!

635
00:59:25.837 --> 00:59:28.590
He took Patricia. 
He was in on it.

636
00:59:28.674 --> 00:59:30.008
There's more to it than that.

637
00:59:30.092 --> 00:59:32.636
No! No, you don't wanna do that.

638
00:59:32.719 --> 00:59:34.221
You don't understand.

639
00:59:35.097 --> 00:59:37.891
Come with me. I'll tell you
what really happened to your sister.


640
00:59:43.647 --> 00:59:45.274
Sienna, you know the rules.

641
00:59:46.608 --> 00:59:50.737
You must not leave the mansion grounds.

642
01:00:23.312 --> 01:00:24.604
You said you have answers.

643
01:00:25.314 --> 01:00:26.148
Hey!

644
01:00:28.108 --> 01:00:30.736
Alman was there when Guraad took Patricia.
He was a part of it.


645
01:00:30.819 --> 01:00:32.571
Tell me I'm wrong.

646
01:00:32.654 --> 01:00:34.656
He did it because of me.

647
01:00:39.286 --> 01:00:42.080
When I was younger,
I had no control at all.


648
01:00:42.164 --> 01:00:45.417
One night, my mom was holding me
and I had a burst of Cosmo.


649
01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.960
I don't even know how it happened.

650
01:00:47.044 --> 01:00:51.006
All I remember is she was holding me
and I destroyed her arms.


651
01:00:51.089 --> 01:00:53.884
And the next moment,
she was dying and it was all my fault.


652
01:00:53.967 --> 01:00:56.637
Alman used the power
of the gold armor to save her,


653
01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:00.015
but ever since the accident,
Guraad needs Cosmo to stay alive.


654
01:01:00.098 --> 01:01:02.184
So what? You've got plenty of it.

655
01:01:02.267 --> 01:01:04.978
Athena's Cosmo's too powerful.
It would kill her.


656
01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:08.190
That's why she sought out kids
like your sister.


657
01:01:08.273 --> 01:01:09.691
What did she do to Pat?

658
01:01:09.775 --> 01:01:11.818
Your sister didn't have any Cosmo.

659
01:01:11.902 --> 01:01:14.363
Once Guraad figured that out,
she let her go.


660
01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:16.782
But she sent her men to watch her.

661
01:01:16.865 --> 01:01:19.201
Guraad knew Patricia was hiding something.

662
01:01:20.369 --> 01:01:21.370
Me.

663
01:01:23.705 --> 01:01:25.540
That's why she never came back.

664
01:01:25.624 --> 01:01:28.585
Look, I'm sorry, Seiya. If I knew, I...

665
01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:35.592
My mother was never the same
after the incident.


666
01:01:35.676 --> 01:01:39.930
She became convinced that Athena
had returned to this world to end it.


667
01:01:40.847 --> 01:01:43.475
She was gonna kill me,
so my father forced me into hiding.


668
01:01:43.558 --> 01:01:44.935
And left Pat behind.

669
01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:48.939
Your sister wasn't the only one.

670
01:01:50.857 --> 01:01:52.317
We left them all behind.

671
01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:56.822
How many kids did your family take?

672
01:02:04.579 --> 01:02:06.915
Our radar picked up Guraad's signature.

673
01:02:11.169 --> 01:02:12.671
So it is happening.

674
01:02:13.255 --> 01:02:14.965
We don't stand a chance.

675
01:02:15.048 --> 01:02:19.553
You need to get out of here.
I'll buy you as much time as I can.


676
01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:21.346
I'm not running from a fight.

677
01:02:21.847 --> 01:02:23.348
Find Sienna.

678
01:02:24.391 --> 01:02:25.392
Protect her.

679
01:02:26.476 --> 01:02:28.603
You're the only one I can trust.

680
01:02:36.028 --> 01:02:37.237
And, Mylock?

681
01:02:38.947 --> 01:02:40.616
You've been a good friend.

682
01:02:42.826 --> 01:02:43.827
Thank you.

683
01:02:51.335 --> 01:02:54.296
After Pat was taken, I ran away.

684
01:02:55.464 --> 01:02:58.258
All these years,
I've never stopped looking for her.


685
01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:02.846
Turns out she was the one
who was keeping away from me.


686
01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:05.098
Your sister sacrificed herself

687
01:03:05.182 --> 01:03:07.017
because she believed
in what you really are.


688
01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:08.810
I never asked to be a knight.

689
01:03:11.396 --> 01:03:13.148
I only wanted to be with Pat.

690
01:03:14.858 --> 01:03:16.902
You think I wanted any of this?

691
01:03:18.487 --> 01:03:22.157
Sometimes I feel like
I'm a guest in my own body.


692
01:03:24.201 --> 01:03:26.703
In time,
I thought I'd learn to control it.


693
01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:28.956
But you're fighting it.

694
01:03:31.917 --> 01:03:33.585
What if my mother was right?

695
01:03:37.631 --> 01:03:42.052
What if I was only born
to bring ruin and misery into this world?


696
01:03:42.135 --> 01:03:43.929
That's not who you are.

697
01:03:47.599 --> 01:03:48.684
How do you know?

698
01:03:50.936 --> 01:03:52.604
I guess I just know.

699
01:04:00.028 --> 01:04:01.655
I need you to promise me...

700
01:04:02.572 --> 01:04:04.032
if things go wrong...

701
01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:08.620
if, in the end, I become a goddess of war
and I can't control my powers...


702
01:04:10.956 --> 01:04:14.418
you will stop me, at all costs.

703
01:04:15.127 --> 01:04:17.879
-You don't mean--
-Just promise me, please.


704
01:04:21.717 --> 01:04:23.302
That's my mother.

705
01:04:27.723 --> 01:04:29.433
Sienna, wait, you can't go back!

706
01:04:29.516 --> 01:04:32.728
-You're the one she's after.
-I have to help my father.


707
01:04:34.104 --> 01:04:35.105
Okay.

708
01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:37.107
I'm with you.

709
01:04:38.025 --> 01:04:39.026
For now.

710
01:05:12.726 --> 01:05:13.727
Shut it! Shut it!

711
01:05:16.355 --> 01:05:17.356
Hold.

712
01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:30.619
Don't let them through!

713
01:05:46.969 --> 01:05:47.928
No! No--!

714
01:06:01.275 --> 01:06:02.276
It's clear.

715
01:06:26.508 --> 01:06:27.509
Where's Seiya?

716
01:06:28.427 --> 01:06:29.511
And whatever her name is?

717
01:06:29.594 --> 01:06:33.390
Sienna is not here,
but I am willing to make a deal.


718
01:06:33.473 --> 01:06:36.018
Old man, you are in no position
to be making deals.


719
01:06:36.101 --> 01:06:37.978
Wait outside, Cassios.

720
01:06:39.271 --> 01:06:40.731
-Are you serious?
-Out!


721
01:06:48.363 --> 01:06:49.364
Hey!

722
01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:56.622
I really need to get to this ship.

723
01:07:12.179 --> 01:07:13.680
Glad you understand.

724
01:07:23.649 --> 01:07:25.734
How do you like my special bullets?

725
01:07:31.323 --> 01:07:32.991
Let's make this easy, shall we?

726
01:07:33.075 --> 01:07:34.868
Just tell me where she is.

727
01:07:37.245 --> 01:07:38.664
Straight to business, then.

728
01:07:38.747 --> 01:07:40.916
What do you expect,
after she almost killed me?


729
01:07:40.999 --> 01:07:43.210
That was an accident and you know it.

730
01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:44.753
You can't blame Sienna for it.

731
01:07:44.836 --> 01:07:46.755
Oh, I never blamed Sienna.

732
01:07:46.838 --> 01:07:48.256
I blamed you, Alman,

733
01:07:48.882 --> 01:07:50.968
for leaving me
to make all the hard choices.


734
01:07:51.051 --> 01:07:54.054
How is murdering a little girl
even a choice?


735
01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:57.099
She's a sword of Damocles
hanging over all of us.


736
01:07:57.182 --> 01:07:59.851
-She's your daughter.
-We never had a daughter!


737
01:08:01.395 --> 01:08:04.231
What we had was an agreement, remember?

738
01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:07.901
That when she'd go out of control,
we'd do whatever had to be done together.


739
01:08:07.985 --> 01:08:11.154
Sienna was entrusted to me.

740
01:08:13.782 --> 01:08:15.325
I'm responsible for her.

741
01:08:15.909 --> 01:08:17.201
I believe in her.

742
01:08:17.285 --> 01:08:19.579
You must believe in our child too.

743
01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:28.629
What about all the children
you took to make these?


744
01:08:31.591 --> 01:08:33.343
Weren't you responsible for them?

745
01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:35.971
It was the only way to save you.

746
01:08:36.053 --> 01:08:38.265
And now I must save
the rest of us from her.


747
01:08:48.734 --> 01:08:50.151
Speaking of the devil.

748
01:08:57.450 --> 01:08:58.535
Dad?

749
01:09:10.172 --> 01:09:12.966
I didn't want to do this,
but I won't let you hurt her.


750
01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:14.384
I know.

751
01:09:14.468 --> 01:09:15.552
Cassios!

752
01:09:24.852 --> 01:09:25.854
Enough!

753
01:09:28.022 --> 01:09:30.651
Get me the girl.
You can do what you want with the boy.


754
01:09:46.833 --> 01:09:48.209
Seiya!

755
01:09:53.548 --> 01:09:54.591
We need to go.

756
01:09:57.094 --> 01:10:00.013
Hey there. I'm gonna take the girl now.

757
01:10:00.931 --> 01:10:02.391
But first, I want you.

758
01:10:02.474 --> 01:10:03.725
Let's end this now.

759
01:10:03.809 --> 01:10:05.227
-No, Seiya. Don't.
-It's okay.


760
01:10:06.561 --> 01:10:07.688
I've got the armor.

761
01:10:12.651 --> 01:10:13.902
Any time now.

762
01:10:16.697 --> 01:10:18.490
Sienna, stay back!

763
01:10:44.141 --> 01:10:45.934
Things have changed, kid.

764
01:10:46.018 --> 01:10:48.270
Face it, you don't have what it takes.

765
01:11:57.381 --> 01:11:59.383
I loved these glasses.

766
01:12:44.094 --> 01:12:45.470
Stop! Stop!

767
01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:49.141
You've won.
I'm coming with you. Let him go.


768
01:12:51.226 --> 01:12:53.186
You're coming with me anyway.

769
01:13:13.081 --> 01:13:14.750
Rescue on the way, kids.

770
01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:35.771
I'm sorry,

771
01:13:35.854 --> 01:13:38.732
but I'm taking you down with me.

772
01:13:43.195 --> 01:13:44.571
Go! Go! Go!

773
01:14:40.085 --> 01:14:41.169
No.

774
01:15:12.534 --> 01:15:13.535
It's ready.

775
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:17.956
Give me a minute.

776
01:15:22.127 --> 01:15:23.128
Leave.

777
01:15:47.986 --> 01:15:50.864
You must think
I'm the worst mother in the world.


778
01:15:51.531 --> 01:15:54.326
You... You killed Father.

779
01:15:55.494 --> 01:15:57.079
Alman chose his own way,

780
01:15:57.162 --> 01:16:00.374
and left me
to clean up his mess, as always.


781
01:16:09.591 --> 01:16:11.385
Athena's Cosmo is too strong.

782
01:16:12.177 --> 01:16:13.971
It won't fix you.

783
01:16:14.054 --> 01:16:14.888
I know.

784
01:16:17.057 --> 01:16:20.727
Yeah. I gave up
on fixing this body a long time ago.


785
01:16:26.775 --> 01:16:29.278
We both have a bomb ticking inside.

786
01:16:30.696 --> 01:16:35.826
Except yours is gonna be so much louder
if we let it go off.


787
01:16:44.376 --> 01:16:46.336
I know I'm doing the right thing.

788
01:16:52.342 --> 01:16:55.637
I just wanted you to know
it doesn't make it any easier.


789
01:17:09.651 --> 01:17:10.902
Will it hurt much?

790
01:17:13.697 --> 01:17:14.698
I don't know.

791
01:17:37.638 --> 01:17:39.014
We need to start.

792
01:17:46.063 --> 01:17:47.189
Do it.

793
01:18:33.944 --> 01:18:34.987
Sienna...

794
01:18:46.415 --> 01:18:48.208
That ain't gonna help, kiddo.

795
01:18:50.043 --> 01:18:51.670
I let her get taken.

796
01:18:52.921 --> 01:18:53.922
I failed.

797
01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:57.884
We all did.

798
01:18:58.468 --> 01:19:00.095
I was supposed to protect her.

799
01:19:00.178 --> 01:19:03.015
Things don't always work out
the way we expect them to.


800
01:19:13.692 --> 01:19:14.985
Come on, Seiya.

801
01:19:37.591 --> 01:19:38.842
Marin.

802
01:19:42.095 --> 01:19:43.513
You were right about me.

803
01:19:45.474 --> 01:19:46.475
I failed.

804
01:19:50.145 --> 01:19:51.313
I'm not a knight.

805
01:19:53.315 --> 01:19:54.650
I couldn't save her.

806
01:19:55.817 --> 01:20:00.656
A knight should not mistake
obsession for purpose.


807
01:20:06.828 --> 01:20:09.164
Seiya, focus.

808
01:20:10.082 --> 01:20:12.125
Who is it that you're trying to save?

809
01:20:19.591 --> 01:20:20.425
Pat.

810
01:20:26.306 --> 01:20:27.391
What does this...?

811
01:20:27.975 --> 01:20:30.394
<i>Who are you really trying to save?</i>

812
01:20:55.294 --> 01:20:56.420
I'm sorry.

813
01:20:57.421 --> 01:20:59.172
I'm so sorry.

814
01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.563
I know.

815
01:21:16.857 --> 01:21:17.899
It's okay.

816
01:21:20.819 --> 01:21:22.112
It wasn't your fault.

817
01:21:23.905 --> 01:21:24.906
Okay.

818
01:21:44.593 --> 01:21:45.719
I'll bring her back.

819
01:21:54.728 --> 01:21:55.854
I promise.

820
01:21:56.563 --> 01:21:57.606
Okay.

821
01:22:07.741 --> 01:22:09.451
Let's go get Sienna back.

822
01:22:28.428 --> 01:22:29.763
How long will it take?

823
01:22:30.389 --> 01:22:33.600
To kill a god? 
Good question.

824
01:22:33.684 --> 01:22:35.102
We're about to find out.

825
01:23:03.547 --> 01:23:06.717
Oh, boy. They got us on radar.

826
01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.218
-What?
-Get ready.


827
01:23:08.302 --> 01:23:09.303
For what?

828
01:23:09.886 --> 01:23:13.056
I can get you
close, but I can't land.

829
01:23:14.391 --> 01:23:15.434
Parachute?

830
01:23:17.936 --> 01:23:19.813
Who says you're not funny?

831
01:23:21.523 --> 01:23:23.191
It's now or never!

832
01:23:26.153 --> 01:23:27.154
Open the doors.

833
01:23:38.415 --> 01:23:40.042
Get yourself out of here!

834
01:23:41.335 --> 01:23:42.628
Godspeed, kiddo.

835
01:25:17.514 --> 01:25:19.016
-Out of the way.
-Hey!


836
01:25:20.142 --> 01:25:21.393
He's mine.

837
01:25:23.729 --> 01:25:25.939
Big deal. You know how to glow.

838
01:25:26.023 --> 01:25:28.942
Step aside, Cassios,
if you don't wanna get hurt.


839
01:25:29.026 --> 01:25:29.860
Hurt?

840
01:25:31.528 --> 01:25:34.031
You should've died
when you had the chance.


841
01:25:51.548 --> 01:25:53.133
What was it that you said, Cassios?

842
01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:56.261
Right.

843
01:26:00.349 --> 01:26:01.183
Oh, no.

844
01:26:01.808 --> 01:26:03.060
Things have changed.

845
01:26:10.609 --> 01:26:13.779
Finally,
the goddess Athena reveals herself.


846
01:26:19.952 --> 01:26:22.204
<i>You must believe in our child too.</i>

847
01:26:27.793 --> 01:26:30.295
Stop! Stop the procedure!

848
01:26:30.379 --> 01:26:32.339
It'll be over soon.

849
01:26:32.422 --> 01:26:33.674
Now!

850
01:26:34.508 --> 01:26:36.426
We are not stopping!

851
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:38.095
Get out of my way.

852
01:26:39.888 --> 01:26:40.973
Guards!

853
01:26:44.977 --> 01:26:47.354
Your services are no longer required.

854
01:26:47.437 --> 01:26:49.064
There's no stopping it now.

855
01:26:49.147 --> 01:26:52.150
In moments,
she'll be nothing but a memory.


856
01:26:55.153 --> 01:26:56.238
Kill him!

857
01:27:59.968 --> 01:28:01.887
You said it yourself, Guraad.

858
01:28:02.596 --> 01:28:06.975
When one goes to war with the gods,
sacrifices must be made.


859
01:28:08.894 --> 01:28:11.772
There must be another way
to protect humanity.


860
01:28:11.855 --> 01:28:13.607
Protect humanity?

861
01:28:14.274 --> 01:28:15.859
Is that what you think you're doing?

862
01:28:35.170 --> 01:28:37.381
Killing Athena was only
half of the battle.


863
01:28:45.931 --> 01:28:48.100
This is the other half.

864
01:28:50.519 --> 01:28:51.895
The gold armor.

865
01:29:05.409 --> 01:29:06.952
Can't let you do that.

866
01:29:07.035 --> 01:29:09.121
Thought you were the only knight in town?

867
01:29:09.746 --> 01:29:11.123
You gotta get out of the way.

868
01:30:24.655 --> 01:30:25.489
Sienna!

869
01:30:57.187 --> 01:30:59.273
You're no match for the Phoenix.

870
01:31:10.450 --> 01:31:12.202
Why do you try so hard?

871
01:31:13.745 --> 01:31:15.122
She's not worth it.

872
01:31:15.872 --> 01:31:17.708
She's not even human.

873
01:31:18.625 --> 01:31:20.502
Sienna's not a god of war.

874
01:31:20.585 --> 01:31:23.213
I don't care what
kind of god she is.

875
01:31:23.297 --> 01:31:24.840
Man needs no gods!

876
01:31:59.499 --> 01:32:01.293
You don't know when to quit.

877
01:32:01.376 --> 01:32:02.836
People keep telling me that.

878
01:32:44.795 --> 01:32:46.797
Stop, you fool!

879
01:33:22.541 --> 01:33:24.001
Sienna!

880
01:33:24.626 --> 01:33:27.045
Listen to me!
That's not your friend anymore!


881
01:33:30.632 --> 01:33:32.551
She's become the goddess of war.

882
01:33:32.634 --> 01:33:34.011
We have to stop her!

883
01:34:29.566 --> 01:34:30.776
<i>Seiya.</i>

884
01:34:30.859 --> 01:34:32.194
<i>I'm losing control.</i>

885
01:34:33.946 --> 01:34:36.823
<i>I don't think
I can hold her back much longer.</i>


886
01:34:43.538 --> 01:34:45.582
<i>You can't save me,</i>

887
01:34:45.666 --> 01:34:48.085
<i>but you can stop Athena.</i>

888
01:34:50.003 --> 01:34:51.505
<i>You must do it now.</i>

889
01:34:52.339 --> 01:34:53.757
<i>At all costs.</i>

890
01:35:49.313 --> 01:35:50.439
Sienna...

891
01:35:52.065 --> 01:35:53.400
you're not a goddess of war.

892
01:35:55.235 --> 01:35:56.903
No one's destiny...

893
01:35:57.863 --> 01:35:59.364
is written in stone.

894
01:36:02.326 --> 01:36:03.493
Not even yours.

895
01:36:10.876 --> 01:36:12.669
The guardian of mankind...

896
01:36:13.503 --> 01:36:15.172
or a petulant jerk...

897
01:36:17.924 --> 01:36:21.428
whatever you choose to be,
I'll never give up on you.


898
01:37:22.823 --> 01:37:23.824
Seiya.

899
01:37:33.583 --> 01:37:34.835
What? Why?

900
01:37:35.419 --> 01:37:38.088
-What was that for?
-Who's the petulant jerk?


901
01:37:38.755 --> 01:37:39.798
Oh, my...

902
01:37:40.882 --> 01:37:42.050
Okay.

903
01:37:43.844 --> 01:37:45.178
-Get up.
-Okay.


904
01:37:51.727 --> 01:37:53.145
Let's get out of here.

905
01:37:55.522 --> 01:37:56.523
Wait.

906
01:38:26.136 --> 01:38:27.179
I'm sorry.

907
01:38:28.388 --> 01:38:29.890
I was wrong about you.

908
01:38:31.308 --> 01:38:34.519
I wasn't so sure myself
for a very long time.


909
01:39:20.274 --> 01:39:21.900
You didn't have to do that.

910
01:39:24.194 --> 01:39:25.237
Yes, I did.

911
01:39:44.798 --> 01:39:46.133
Did I do this?

912
01:39:52.639 --> 01:39:53.640
Mylock!

913
01:39:54.182 --> 01:39:55.309
Sienna!

914
01:39:58.812 --> 01:39:59.813
Are you okay?

915
01:40:00.439 --> 01:40:01.440
I'm okay.

916
01:40:11.658 --> 01:40:12.993
Glad you made it, Seiya.

917
01:40:14.286 --> 01:40:15.287
You too.

918
01:41:01.208 --> 01:41:02.626
So, boss...

919
01:41:04.294 --> 01:41:05.629
what do we do now?

920
01:41:07.839 --> 01:41:11.718
Athena's awakening is a sign the old gods
will soon return and try to start a war.


921
01:41:14.346 --> 01:41:17.140
We need to gather all the Knights
of the Zodiac to stop them.


922
01:41:21.311 --> 01:41:24.314
I'm at your service, my lord.

923
01:41:28.110 --> 01:41:29.945
Stop. Don't call me that.

924
01:41:30.028 --> 01:41:31.446
Whatever you say, princess.

925
01:41:32.698 --> 01:41:34.574
No. And definitely not that.

926
01:41:42.708 --> 01:41:45.210
Before we gather the knights,
there's something else we need to do.


927
01:41:46.211 --> 01:41:47.212
What's that?

928
01:41:50.132 --> 01:41:52.050
It's time to find Patricia.

929
01:41:57.222 --> 01:41:58.223
Thank you.

930
01:41:59.725 --> 01:42:01.393
It's the least a goddess could do.
