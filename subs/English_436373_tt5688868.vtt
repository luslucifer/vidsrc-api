00:03:57.186 --> 00:03:58.355
Hi.

2
00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:02.929
- Look, I don't know what you want me to say.
- Could start with "thank you".


3
00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.514
Thanks... for picking me up.

4
00:04:05.594 --> 00:04:07.475
"Sorry" would be nice.

5
00:04:20.918 --> 00:04:25.583
- You're smoking again.
- Yeah, I'm smoking again.


6
00:04:26.608 --> 00:04:28.678
Not around him, Max.

7
00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:39.723
You look good.

8
00:04:39.803 --> 00:04:43.084
I'm eating good, 
I'm not drinking...

9
00:04:43.164 --> 00:04:45.193
...I'm not smoking...

10
00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:46.974
...nothing.

11
00:04:47.252 --> 00:04:51.102
- Please tell me you learned your lesson.
- I learned lots of lessons.


12
00:04:51.182 --> 00:04:54.981
I learned how to make a shiv.
Turns out prison has arts & crafts time.


13
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:56.874
It's not funny.

14
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.667
How is he?

15
00:05:05.947 --> 00:05:07.844
He's good.

16
00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:09.778
Yeah.

17
00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:12.524
- He's good.
- That's good.


18
00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:15.485
- Thanks for not bringing him.
- Well, he's got school.


19
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.500
- He's in school?
- Mm, preschool.


20
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.090
- Preschool?
- Yep, he says he's a big kid now.


21
00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:31.543
- What, so this is what you listen to now?
- Yeah, it's only been a year.


22
00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:34.746
A year, a month, and nine days.
But who's counting?


23
00:05:34.826 --> 00:05:38.166
Yeah, and not much has changed
since then, it's just some music.


24
00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.598
Really? Did they come play for you
during your stint in Folsom?


25
00:06:44.562 --> 00:06:46.193
Max?

26
00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:49.470
Max, look at me. Look at me, Max.

27
00:06:50.292 --> 00:06:51.804
Max.

28
00:07:02.455 --> 00:07:03.976
Sorry.

29
00:07:05.756 --> 00:07:07.546
It's fine.

30
00:07:09.326 --> 00:07:12.050
No, it wasn't. It sucked.

31
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.043
It was fine.

32
00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:11.911
Do you want anything?

33
00:08:16.195 --> 00:08:17.607
Okay.

34
00:08:34.989 --> 00:08:38.312
This is a missing person. 
Have you seen him?

35
00:08:38.745 --> 00:08:41.332
Bigfoot got 'im! 
He's coming 'round again.

36
00:08:41.412 --> 00:08:43.184
Yeah, right.

37
00:08:43.882 --> 00:08:46.161
Hairy, ape-man bastard.

38
00:08:46.718 --> 00:08:50.958
You and your kind ain't foolin' me
with your wampum, your Oh-Mah...


39
00:08:51.038 --> 00:08:53.485
...and your mystic injun horseshit!

40
00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:57.389
Nickel Pete, if you see him,
you give me a call.


41
00:08:57.469 --> 00:09:00.210
- Yeah, I'll do that. I'll call you.
- Alright, thank you.


42
00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:03.988
You're all in on it...

43
00:09:04.068 --> 00:09:06.073
...try the fuckin' donuts.

44
00:09:06.153 --> 00:09:08.230
Bigfoot lovers.

45
00:09:14.254 --> 00:09:15.767
Hey...

46
00:09:16.647 --> 00:09:18.502
...big, hairy bastard.

47
00:09:18.582 --> 00:09:21.217
- Sorry?
- Giant, hairy, mohawk motherfucker...


48
00:09:21.297 --> 00:09:24.142
...coming 'round again...
him and his big ol' fuckin' feet.


49
00:09:24.222 --> 00:09:26.093
Gonna getcha!

50
00:09:26.673 --> 00:09:29.281
Yeah, sure as shit. 
Twenty dollars.

51
00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.386
Have a nice day.

52
00:09:46.806 --> 00:09:48.649
That's what I'm talking 'bout.

53
00:09:51.365 --> 00:09:54.651
Hey! Put it in your pants, ya pervert!

54
00:09:55.959 --> 00:09:59.003
- Hey!
- Okay, alright. Ow!


55
00:10:00.007 --> 00:10:01.946
Well, well...

56
00:10:02.026 --> 00:10:03.598
Boo!

57
00:10:05.363 --> 00:10:07.301
Convict.

58
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:09.270
Ex-convict.

59
00:10:10.455 --> 00:10:12.568
I'm shakin' in my boots!

60
00:10:15.022 --> 00:10:16.834
Are you done?

61
00:10:35.242 --> 00:10:37.856
Got you some, uh, healthy trail mix.

62
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.123
Really?

63
00:10:44.203 --> 00:10:47.567
You've been out an hour and you
already got me on an open container.


64
00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:51.829
- And it starts. Ashley, it's just a beer.
- No! It's a Class 2 misdemeanor...


65
00:10:51.909 --> 00:10:54.373
...'cause I already got one, remember?

66
00:10:55.853 --> 00:10:59.241
- I guess you didn't learn a goddamn thing.
- I learned plenty, actually.


67
00:10:59.321 --> 00:11:03.450
I learned that when making a shiv,
you've gotta taper and serrate the blade...


68
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:08.185
...otherwise you're just poppin' people with
needles and that's something they're used to.


69
00:11:08.265 --> 00:11:11.098
But when the time is right,
the only thing that you have to do...


70
00:11:11.178 --> 00:11:13.526
...is aim for the sweet spot,
just right in the kidney.


71
00:11:13.606 --> 00:11:16.028
- Enough!
- Then you say something.


72
00:11:16.108 --> 00:11:18.939
You say something
to make all this good again.


73
00:11:20.119 --> 00:11:23.832
Because you didn't say a goddamn thing
when I was sitting in handcuffs...


74
00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:29.025
You know... you weren't
much better than me, Ashley.


75
00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.653
Not much, but at least I was better.

76
00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:35.306
And I'm clean now, courtesy
of the Department of Corrections.


77
00:11:35.386 --> 00:11:37.409
Congratulations!
I'm glad they could do it for you...


78
00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:39.879
...but your wife and son
weren't worth enough.


79
00:11:39.959 --> 00:11:42.539
For a year, a month, and nine days...

80
00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:45.589
...I have been planning this exact moment.

81
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:47.769
I'm just fucking it up.

82
00:11:47.849 --> 00:11:50.704
How could you fuck this up? It's me.

83
00:11:51.384 --> 00:11:54.651
This is me. This is us. What?

84
00:11:55.153 --> 00:11:58.037
- What? Say it.
- I'm scared.


85
00:12:00.517 --> 00:12:02.445
Right now in this moment...

86
00:12:02.715 --> 00:12:04.610
...I'm scared.

87
00:12:04.831 --> 00:12:06.653
You're scared?

88
00:12:07.002 --> 00:12:08.945
I'm scared shitless.

89
00:12:10.346 --> 00:12:12.191
Good answer.

90
00:12:18.855 --> 00:12:20.431
Shit!

91
00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:23.105
What was that?

92
00:13:09.956 --> 00:13:11.357
Oh, my God.

93
00:13:12.863 --> 00:13:15.173
- He's not moving.
- What happened to him?


94
00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:17.421
Where did he come from? 
What was he doing?

95
00:13:17.501 --> 00:13:19.336
I don't know.

96
00:13:21.316 --> 00:13:22.887
But our car didn't do all that.

97
00:13:23.127 --> 00:13:25.079
Oh, my God!

98
00:13:31.986 --> 00:13:34.329
I'm going to get my phone.

99
00:13:38.817 --> 00:13:41.494
Ashley! Ashley!

100
00:13:41.574 --> 00:13:43.338
Ashley!

101
00:13:44.072 --> 00:13:46.821
Ashley, wait. There's beer all over
the car. We just hit this guy.


102
00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:49.424
Yeah, there's no way we did all that, Max.
That was not just us.


103
00:13:49.504 --> 00:13:52.835
Jesus, Ash! Just got out. Party of one?

104
00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:55.943
Don't do this to me. 
Think about us.

105
00:13:56.335 --> 00:13:58.141
Ashley, please.

106
00:14:03.066 --> 00:14:07.666
Yeah, hello? I'm on Highway 23
about 25 miles north of state prison.


107
00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:09.256
There's been an accident.

108
00:14:10.076 --> 00:14:13.372
Yes, there's a man
here and he needs help.

109
00:14:14.552 --> 00:14:17.460
Yes, as soon as possible, please. Yes.

110
00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.136
Max!

111
00:14:20.877 --> 00:14:21.989
Ow!

112
00:14:23.987 --> 00:14:25.700
Oh, my God, Max!

113
00:14:59.849 --> 00:15:01.367
Max!

114
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:05.366
Wake up!

115
00:15:29.286 --> 00:15:31.968
Max! Wake up!

116
00:15:47.647 --> 00:15:48.959
Max!

117
00:16:28.463 --> 00:16:30.142
Max!

118
00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:35.051
Max!

119
00:17:09.629 --> 00:17:13.177
Max! Max? Max, wake up!

120
00:17:14.357 --> 00:17:17.056
Wake up, Max. Wake up!

121
00:17:18.047 --> 00:17:20.527
Max! Please, Max!

122
00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:24.667
Wake up! Max!

123
00:17:25.387 --> 00:17:29.037
Wake up, Max! Wake up, Max!

124
00:17:47.442 --> 00:17:49.855
Come on. Okay.

125
00:18:00.305 --> 00:18:02.918
Come on, keep going, almost there.

126
00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:13.696
What happened?

127
00:18:13.976 --> 00:18:15.917
You fucking fell in the water.

128
00:18:18.115 --> 00:18:21.454
- You're going into shock, come here.
- No, I'm just... I'm just cold.


129
00:18:21.534 --> 00:18:24.155
Come on, sit up. Come here.

130
00:18:25.135 --> 00:18:27.209
Okay, let's get you warm.

131
00:18:33.104 --> 00:18:36.194
We need to get you
warm, come on. Sit up.

132
00:18:38.651 --> 00:18:40.548
Stand up.

133
00:19:17.131 --> 00:19:19.678
- Sheriff!
- Mrs. Goring.


134
00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:22.348
- You find him?
- I'm sorry, not yet.


135
00:19:22.428 --> 00:19:24.200
What are you gonna do about it?

136
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.819
We're still doing everything
we can within our means.


137
00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:31.323
Bullshit! I want answers now,
or I'll have your job!


138
00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:32.958
Please...

139
00:19:33.838 --> 00:19:36.585
...Mrs. Goring, we will find your husband.

140
00:19:36.665 --> 00:19:39.715
- I promise you.
- You know something!


141
00:19:39.795 --> 00:19:42.099
You know something you're not telling us!

142
00:19:50.223 --> 00:19:53.146
I see Mrs. G sniped ya. Any luck?

143
00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:54.881
No.

144
00:19:55.561 --> 00:20:00.242
Say, are you part of this vast
Indian-Bigfoot conspiracy?


145
00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:03.049
- Nope.
- Nickel Pete...


146
00:20:03.129 --> 00:20:05.624
...says I should know all about it.

147
00:20:06.104 --> 00:20:08.544
Thought I was missing out on something.

148
00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:12.572
Nickel Pete might be right. Maybe there's
something to those Oh-Mah stories.


149
00:20:13.662 --> 00:20:16.084
You're taking sides with Nickel Pete?

150
00:20:16.164 --> 00:20:18.896
If it means honoring the traditions,
I guess so.


151
00:20:18.976 --> 00:20:23.247
So you're saying you would call on
Nickel Pete as an expert reliable witness?


152
00:20:23.327 --> 00:20:27.271
- Uh, no.
- Then what the hell are you saying?


153
00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:29.907
I'm saying we shouldn't ignore
the Oh-Mah legends...


154
00:20:29.987 --> 00:20:31.756
...Nickel Pete or no Nickel Pete.

155
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.188
Sheriff?

156
00:20:37.768 --> 00:20:40.478
I think you're smoking something
other than tobacco in that...


157
00:20:40.558 --> 00:20:43.044
...peace pipe bong of yours, Deputy.

158
00:20:43.124 --> 00:20:46.565
- What's this, Nell?
- 911 call, no name or nothing.


159
00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:49.093
Aw, Hell's monkeys, 
I was just out this way.

160
00:20:49.173 --> 00:20:52.251
- Call if you need backup.
- Yeah, I will. I'll use the radio.


161
00:20:52.331 --> 00:20:55.341
Because smoke signals
don't work so well in the rain.


162
00:20:57.114 --> 00:20:58.970
Don't fall and break your hip.

163
00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.030
You're lucky I let you wear a gun.

164
00:21:11.137 --> 00:21:12.749
Okay.

165
00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:17.767
Your lighter... 
I need your lighter.

166
00:21:17.847 --> 00:21:19.893
Come on, come on.

167
00:21:35.387 --> 00:21:37.629
Come on, please.

168
00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.578
Light. Oh, my God.

169
00:21:51.606 --> 00:21:53.159
Okay.

170
00:22:06.676 --> 00:22:09.012
Come on, fire.

171
00:22:10.297 --> 00:22:11.823
Yes.

172
00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:23.863
Here we go.

173
00:22:24.143 --> 00:22:26.755
Okay. Okay.

174
00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:34.264
Okay, we're almost there.

175
00:22:36.123 --> 00:22:37.659
Okay.

176
00:22:41.754 --> 00:22:44.230
Okay. Okay.

177
00:22:47.249 --> 00:22:49.070
Come here.

178
00:22:54.465 --> 00:22:57.121
There was an easier way
to get my clothes off.


179
00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.407
Not with you.

180
00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:06.438
I'm sorry.

181
00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:09.976
- It's okay.
- I'm so sorry.


182
00:23:25.538 --> 00:23:27.551
What have we got here?

183
00:24:17.239 --> 00:24:20.804
Nellibell, I'm at the location
of the 911 call...


184
00:24:20.884 --> 00:24:24.777
...about a hundred yards north
of Marker 23 on the highway.


185
00:24:24.857 --> 00:24:28.004
You call Nelson, you tell him
to get over here with a winch...


186
00:24:28.088 --> 00:24:32.168
...and about a hundred feet
of cable ASAP. Lickety-split.


187
00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:42.070
In the morning we'll set things right, okay?

188
00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.252
I'll get you back to Jameson.

189
00:24:44.332 --> 00:24:46.120
Where is Jameson?

190
00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.189
He's at mom's.

191
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:49.726
- Poor guy.
- Stop.


192
00:24:49.806 --> 00:24:52.211
- It's worse than prison.
- No.


193
00:24:53.474 --> 00:24:55.071
I didn't know what was going to happen.

194
00:24:55.151 --> 00:24:57.361
I thought we'd either be yelling
at each other all night...


195
00:24:57.441 --> 00:25:00.327
...or we'd be shacked up
in a hotel room somewhere.


196
00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:05.185
Whatever it was, it wasn't this.

197
00:25:05.265 --> 00:25:07.669
I mean, what's our next move?
What are we gonna do?


198
00:25:07.749 --> 00:25:09.996
You got me here to protect you.

199
00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:13.415
Defensive prison techniques and all.

200
00:25:13.495 --> 00:25:15.476
So, this shiv business...

201
00:25:15.556 --> 00:25:17.703
It's a legitimate thing.

202
00:25:17.783 --> 00:25:20.856
- Who told you that?
- My cellmate.


203
00:25:22.124 --> 00:25:26.429
Legend has it, he shanked about
a dozen guys back in the day.


204
00:25:26.509 --> 00:25:28.653
Please tell me you didn't shank anyone.

205
00:25:28.733 --> 00:25:32.375
No, I couldn't hurt anybody else.

206
00:25:33.898 --> 00:25:35.879
Not after all that's happened.

207
00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:37.824
It was an accident, Max.

208
00:25:37.904 --> 00:25:39.411
No...

209
00:25:41.199 --> 00:25:43.094
...no, it wasn't.

210
00:25:45.425 --> 00:25:47.441
But we'll get you back, okay?

211
00:25:48.421 --> 00:25:51.870
We'll get us back to Jameson
and then we'll, uh...


212
00:25:52.753 --> 00:25:55.422
...we'll make sure everything's
alright, okay? I promise.


213
00:26:01.536 --> 00:26:03.109
Hey.

214
00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:05.190
Look at me.

215
00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:11.662
You gotta trust me, okay?

216
00:26:16.592 --> 00:26:18.405
I trust you.

217
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:37.169
Let's get this on the road.

218
00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:53.419
Ashley Carr.

219
00:26:54.329 --> 00:26:56.278
Ashley Carr.

220
00:26:59.168 --> 00:27:00.975
This guy...

221
00:27:01.055 --> 00:27:05.313
...check with the prison, find out
if they had any inmates released today.


222
00:28:30.877 --> 00:28:33.466
Max! Where are you?

223
00:28:33.546 --> 00:28:35.233
Ashley?

224
00:28:37.005 --> 00:28:39.171
- What's wrong?
- Where are my clothes?


225
00:28:39.251 --> 00:28:42.551
- Aren't they where you left them?
- I left them right here, I didn't touch them.


226
00:28:42.631 --> 00:28:44.637
Well, they have to be here somewhere.

227
00:28:45.617 --> 00:28:48.110
- What is this?
- Well, there are your shoes.


228
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:50.078
What the fuck?

229
00:28:52.915 --> 00:28:55.360
Take this. Here.

230
00:28:56.143 --> 00:28:59.350
- That's it?
- I mean, unless you want my pants, too.


231
00:29:03.742 --> 00:29:06.107
- Works for me.
- Good, I'm glad it works for someone.


232
00:29:06.187 --> 00:29:07.951
- Alright, let's go.
- Hold on.


233
00:29:08.031 --> 00:29:09.643
Ugh.

234
00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:30.182
How are you feeling?

235
00:29:30.262 --> 00:29:32.337
- Really good.
- Really?


236
00:29:32.417 --> 00:29:35.420
Yeah, I mean, my head fuckin'
hurts but the view ain't bad.


237
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.813
Well, let's get home.

238
00:29:40.363 --> 00:29:42.576
Come on. This'll be easy.

239
00:29:43.556 --> 00:29:47.133
We'll just follow the river
back up to the road...


240
00:29:47.213 --> 00:29:49.024
...flag someone down...

241
00:29:49.804 --> 00:29:50.821
...it'll be easy.

242
00:29:59.382 --> 00:30:01.264
Shit's Creek, I presume?

243
00:30:59.025 --> 00:31:03.046
My shoes are wet. My feet feel
like cold prunes. It sucks!


244
00:31:03.796 --> 00:31:06.002
Well, I've got wet jeans...

245
00:31:06.082 --> 00:31:08.345
...and sand in my crotch...

246
00:31:08.425 --> 00:31:10.448
...so it's chafing my nuts.

247
00:31:11.128 --> 00:31:12.941
You win.

248
00:31:34.168 --> 00:31:35.878
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.


249
00:31:40.026 --> 00:31:41.862
You know who that is?

250
00:31:42.759 --> 00:31:45.059
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


251
00:31:45.139 --> 00:31:47.877
It's our inbred hunting buddies
from back at the gas station.


252
00:31:47.957 --> 00:31:51.081
Unfortunately they're the only ones
that might have a cell phone or a radio.


253
00:31:53.061 --> 00:31:55.567
- Come on, we don't have a choice.
- Great.


254
00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:57.494
Come on.

255
00:32:00.136 --> 00:32:02.941
Maxwell Carr, just released yesterday.

256
00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:05.248
- What was he in for?
- Reckless endangerment...


257
00:32:05.328 --> 00:32:08.548
...assault with a deadly weapon.
His car hit a kid.


258
00:32:08.628 --> 00:32:12.601
Possession, substance abuse,
same old stupid fucking white man.


259
00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:16.447
So... the wife picks him up...

260
00:32:16.527 --> 00:32:19.207
...they crash the car, and vanish.

261
00:32:24.416 --> 00:32:28.673
So you're telling me right here, right now,
to my face that you actually believe...


262
00:32:28.753 --> 00:32:30.761
...there's an Oh
-Mah out there?

263
00:32:30.841 --> 00:32:35.674
Motherfucking Bigfoot himself!
Abducting white people, ex-cons no less.


264
00:32:35.754 --> 00:32:38.319
No, but I like it better
than being told it's wrong.


265
00:32:38.399 --> 00:32:40.721
I like it better
than being told it's not true.


266
00:32:40.801 --> 00:32:43.701
I like it better than being told
what to think. It's an identity.


267
00:32:43.781 --> 00:32:45.403
- Protest.
- Same thing.


268
00:32:45.483 --> 00:32:46.569
Not even close.

269
00:32:46.649 --> 00:32:50.539
Then you tell me right here, right now
you 100% don't believe it's Oh-Mah.


270
00:32:51.348 --> 00:32:53.162
A-ha! See that?

271
00:32:53.242 --> 00:32:56.112
I don't believe it's Oh
-Mah. Swear to God!

272
00:32:56.192 --> 00:32:58.715
Sure thing, Sheriff.
You should go ask the Whispering Woman.


273
00:32:58.795 --> 00:33:01.143
She might know what happened.
That's her turf.


274
00:33:01.223 --> 00:33:05.838
With all due respect, Deputy,
to the ancestors... fuck that.


275
00:33:07.268 --> 00:33:09.942
- You're afraid of her.
- What?


276
00:33:11.297 --> 00:33:14.238
Okay, some. Is she even still alive?

277
00:33:14.318 --> 00:33:16.356
She'll always be alive.

278
00:33:16.436 --> 00:33:18.142
She's not human.

279
00:33:18.222 --> 00:33:20.322
Please tell me you don't really believe that.

280
00:33:20.402 --> 00:33:22.588
No, not really.

281
00:33:22.668 --> 00:33:26.399
You should go talk to her.
What she knows will die with her.


282
00:33:26.479 --> 00:33:28.794
Should listen to her before it's too late.

283
00:33:28.874 --> 00:33:31.122
Yeah, listening to answers
you don't believe in.


284
00:33:31.202 --> 00:33:33.599
At least not in this day and age.

285
00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:37.068
Probably not.
I really wish I could believe...


286
00:33:37.148 --> 00:33:39.550
- ...I really do.
- Ironic, huh?


287
00:33:40.035 --> 00:33:41.848
I'd say tragic.

288
00:34:03.151 --> 00:34:05.312
You should probably sit this one out.

289
00:34:05.901 --> 00:34:07.715
Ya think?

290
00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.346
Hey.

291
00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:30.503
Hey, hey, where's the funky bunch, man?

292
00:34:32.011 --> 00:34:33.675
The funky...

293
00:34:33.755 --> 00:34:35.791
Well, well, well...

294
00:34:35.871 --> 00:34:37.522
...if it ain't the convict!

295
00:34:38.484 --> 00:34:41.200
Oh, I apologize... ex-convict.

296
00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:45.037
Look, there was an accident on the road.
Does anybody have a cell phone?


297
00:34:45.117 --> 00:34:47.050
Cell phone?

298
00:34:47.415 --> 00:34:49.293
Cell phone?

299
00:34:50.882 --> 00:34:53.037
Think I... think I lost mine.

300
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:55.697
Well, sorry about that.

301
00:34:55.777 --> 00:34:59.107
I mean, hell, it ain't like we get
a lot of service out in these parts.


302
00:34:59.187 --> 00:35:02.188
I mean, really, what's a moose
gonna do with a cell phone?


303
00:35:02.701 --> 00:35:06.217
Moose... moose with a cell phone.

304
00:35:06.297 --> 00:35:10.154
- Guys, we're just trying to get back.
- It's not so much the technology...


305
00:35:10.234 --> 00:35:12.789
...it's the hoof!
Can't reach those little buttons.


306
00:35:14.622 --> 00:35:17.866
So, on the cell phone,
do you have one or not?


307
00:35:19.776 --> 00:35:23.492
Maybe you could just point us
in the general direction of the road.


308
00:35:23.572 --> 00:35:25.103
Road?

309
00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:28.084
Road?

310
00:35:34.896 --> 00:35:37.773
- That way.
- Is there any basement?


311
00:35:41.127 --> 00:35:42.688
Say...

312
00:35:42.768 --> 00:35:45.856
...you know, I'm curious.
What happened to that, uh...


313
00:35:45.936 --> 00:35:48.643
- ...pretty little thing you were with?
- Oh, yeah.


314
00:35:48.723 --> 00:35:51.603
- My wife?
- Ooh.


315
00:35:52.134 --> 00:35:55.275
- "My wife?"
- She's around.


316
00:35:56.555 --> 00:35:58.368
Around where?

317
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.533
- She's around.
- Probably shopping.


318
00:36:04.613 --> 00:36:06.494
With the mooses.

319
00:36:06.574 --> 00:36:08.621
For a cell phone!

320
00:36:10.287 --> 00:36:13.175
- How about a radio?
- Mm, radio?


321
00:36:13.255 --> 00:36:15.545
- Got a radio?
- Radio?


322
00:36:17.316 --> 00:36:20.060
Oh, hey, you know what? I got one.

323
00:36:20.794 --> 00:36:22.989
- Perfect.
- But it don't work.


324
00:36:23.069 --> 00:36:26.999
- Aw.
- Nope. Damn thing crapped out on us.


325
00:36:27.079 --> 00:36:29.500
Cheap gook piece of shit.

326
00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:31.547
Do you mind if I
take a look at it?

327
00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:34.171
You want to look at my radio?

328
00:36:34.251 --> 00:36:38.042
What, you don't think I can understand
a basic electronical device, convict?


329
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:40.027
Is that what you're saying to me?

330
00:36:41.007 --> 00:36:42.766
And you're gonna help me with that?

331
00:36:42.846 --> 00:36:44.457
- Lefty?
- Yeah.


332
00:36:44.537 --> 00:36:48.344
- What's that word say?
- It's, uh... "on".


333
00:36:48.424 --> 00:36:51.163
On! Jumping Jesus on a gump stump!

334
00:36:51.243 --> 00:36:52.767
That's the problem.

335
00:36:53.771 --> 00:36:57.487
Hell, it is a damn good thing that this
ex-convict wandered through here...


336
00:36:57.567 --> 00:37:00.722
...with his taxpayer
prison education and all.


337
00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:02.659
City folk... damn smart.

338
00:37:02.739 --> 00:37:05.477
Yeah, I just figured out
my toaster last week.


339
00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:09.030
- It makes toast!
- Can I use the radio or not?


340
00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:13.794
I don't think so.

341
00:37:13.874 --> 00:37:16.130
Look, I don't know where
all this hostility's coming from...


342
00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:18.862
- ...but we're just trying to get back.
- 'Cause, hell, I don't know...


343
00:37:18.942 --> 00:37:21.660
...having an ex-convict in our midst...

344
00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:24.222
...I mean, it's nothing personal, son, but...

345
00:37:24.302 --> 00:37:27.266
...importing convicted criminals into
our own backyard, is that cool, guys?


346
00:37:27.346 --> 00:37:29.476
- No.
- No.


347
00:37:29.556 --> 00:37:31.933
- Nope.
- I paid my debt.


348
00:37:36.813 --> 00:37:40.012
Hot damn. That's good to know.

349
00:37:40.092 --> 00:37:42.309
Seriously, I'm done kidding around.

350
00:37:56.233 --> 00:37:58.222
Come on, Max.

351
00:37:59.202 --> 00:38:01.066
Ah, hell, kid.

352
00:38:01.864 --> 00:38:04.386
We're just kidding around!
We're having some fun!


353
00:38:05.868 --> 00:38:07.656
Just kidding.

354
00:38:07.736 --> 00:38:10.292
We got a CB in the truck. Right?

355
00:38:10.372 --> 00:38:11.253
Yup.

356
00:38:11.333 --> 00:38:13.495
We can get you there
in, what, about an hour?

357
00:38:13.575 --> 00:38:15.039
- Yeah.
- Maybe four.


358
00:38:15.119 --> 00:38:17.375
We can get him
there in about an hour.

359
00:38:17.455 --> 00:38:19.265
You can call the Sheriff.

360
00:38:35.573 --> 00:38:40.180
You know, I'm still curious, what happened
to that pretty little wife of yours anyway?


361
00:38:40.595 --> 00:38:42.874
I told you, she's around.

362
00:38:42.954 --> 00:38:44.868
Whoa! Whoa!

363
00:38:45.965 --> 00:38:49.064
Survey says thank you, Jesus!

364
00:38:50.115 --> 00:38:52.175
Speak of the devil.

365
00:38:52.503 --> 00:38:54.061
We had the accident.

366
00:38:54.141 --> 00:38:56.606
Is that what you kids
are calling it these days?


367
00:38:56.686 --> 00:38:58.993
Hell, I got a
boner a cat couldn't scratch!

368
00:38:59.073 --> 00:39:00.795
Hey!

369
00:39:00.875 --> 00:39:03.146
Keep that shit in your pants.

370
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.522
Alright, listen up.

371
00:39:05.602 --> 00:39:09.415
These two fine citizens, well, they, uh...
they need our help.


372
00:39:09.495 --> 00:39:13.296
And us being... you know,
good samaritans and all...


373
00:39:13.376 --> 00:39:17.560
...we're obliged to help 'em any way
we can. So with that being said...


374
00:39:18.552 --> 00:39:21.664
...I want you all to treat
our new guests here...


375
00:39:21.744 --> 00:39:23.719
...with the utmost respect.

376
00:39:26.065 --> 00:39:27.914
- Shut up. Hey!
- Sorry.


377
00:39:27.994 --> 00:39:30.473
That means keep that shit in your pants!

378
00:39:32.253 --> 00:39:35.169
All of ya's... you hear?

379
00:39:35.249 --> 00:39:37.624
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.


380
00:39:37.704 --> 00:39:40.191
- Okay.
- Yes.


381
00:39:40.271 --> 00:39:42.154
Alright.

382
00:39:44.524 --> 00:39:47.385
Let's pack it up. 
We're moving out.

383
00:39:49.475 --> 00:39:51.257
Let's go!

384
00:39:57.304 --> 00:39:59.135
There's something in these woods.

385
00:39:59.915 --> 00:40:03.012
- We gotta go.
- Come on.


386
00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:05.877
Here you go, sweetheart.

387
00:40:06.597 --> 00:40:08.740
- What's up, baby?
- Get going.


388
00:40:14.213 --> 00:40:15.812
Hey.

389
00:40:15.892 --> 00:40:17.693
There you go.

390
00:40:20.472 --> 00:40:21.906
Thank you.

391
00:40:31.497 --> 00:40:34.395
Yeah, alignment's off,
the gears are stripped.


392
00:40:34.475 --> 00:40:37.023
Car was put in park, moved sideways...

393
00:40:37.103 --> 00:40:39.321
...then forward off the road.

394
00:40:40.171 --> 00:40:43.304
- It was pushed?
- I don't know about pushed.


395
00:40:45.443 --> 00:40:46.649
Are you sure, Nelson?

396
00:40:46.729 --> 00:40:50.495
Well, maybe the transmission
got knocked there during the accident.


397
00:40:59.891 --> 00:41:01.738
Yeah, maybe.

398
00:41:16.918 --> 00:41:20.207
Bigfoot got 'em. 
Big goddamn footy-mother...

399
00:41:20.287 --> 00:41:24.820
...bushy, effin' tall-ass hairy bastard.

400
00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:26.746
You know it!

401
00:41:31.833 --> 00:41:34.528
Sure as eggs is eggs, Cochise.

402
00:42:45.765 --> 00:42:49.263
Now that we got you here, uh...
we're not so bad, are we?


403
00:42:49.343 --> 00:42:53.225
Hell, you could be in the South.
Hey, Lefty. Are we in the South?


404
00:42:53.305 --> 00:42:56.799
- No, no, we're not in the South.
- Do you even know where the South is?


405
00:42:56.879 --> 00:42:58.940
Yeah, it's in the South.

406
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:02.067
I mean, hell, you
know, we as a community...

407
00:43:02.933 --> 00:43:07.003
...we really don't mind you convicts
just waltzing through our homes, right?


408
00:43:08.287 --> 00:43:10.842
I'm sorry... ex-convicts.

409
00:43:12.216 --> 00:43:15.932
- So you want to revisit this again?
- Just hear me out, alright?


410
00:43:16.012 --> 00:43:18.590
I mean, hell, our wives and our schools...

411
00:43:19.607 --> 00:43:22.386
...they actually find it
enriching, you know, this...


412
00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:24.928
...close proximity to such a wealth of...

413
00:43:25.404 --> 00:43:28.268
...hell, what's the word
I'm looking for, anyway?


414
00:43:28.348 --> 00:43:30.650
How about "rehabilitation"?

415
00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:33.365
Damn, man, that's a word and a half.

416
00:43:33.445 --> 00:43:34.716
Sure is.

417
00:43:34.796 --> 00:43:38.805
Looks like our ex-convict's
got himself a vocabulary.


418
00:43:38.885 --> 00:43:43.217
Yeah, but... no, that's not the word
I was thinking about.


419
00:43:43.497 --> 00:43:46.045
Then what is the
word you were looking for?

420
00:43:49.025 --> 00:43:50.850
I don't know. Something, uh...

421
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:53.590
...less fitting for mixed company, I guess.

422
00:43:56.768 --> 00:43:58.357
You know we're going the wrong way?

423
00:44:01.103 --> 00:44:03.195
The sun rises in the East.

424
00:44:03.775 --> 00:44:06.566
So that's East. 
We're going West.

425
00:44:06.646 --> 00:44:09.235
We're going to our trucks, young lady...

426
00:44:09.815 --> 00:44:12.013
...and our trucks are this way.

427
00:44:12.093 --> 00:44:14.172
It's where the CB is, darlin'.

428
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:48.391
Body and spirit look like
they're going north and south.


429
00:44:49.671 --> 00:44:52.637
I'm joking. You do look like shit.

430
00:44:52.717 --> 00:44:54.329
Well...

431
00:44:54.722 --> 00:44:57.067
...thank you very much.

432
00:44:57.147 --> 00:44:59.426
- Go see the Whispering Woman?
- Hell, no.


433
00:44:59.506 --> 00:45:02.168
- Scares you, doesn't she?
- No!


434
00:45:02.248 --> 00:45:04.891
- Okay, yeah.
- Yeah, me too.


435
00:45:06.171 --> 00:45:08.460
Verna Six Trees has cancer.

436
00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.914
They're having a peyote ceremony
for her, you should come.


437
00:45:12.594 --> 00:45:14.809
Verna Six Trees...

438
00:45:16.989 --> 00:45:19.488
...well, I really hate those things.

439
00:45:19.568 --> 00:45:23.426
They go on forever,
smoke burns my eyes, I get piles.


440
00:45:23.506 --> 00:45:26.453
Take the medicine. 
Have a vision.

441
00:45:26.533 --> 00:45:29.186
Offset all this white man law and order,
you need to be reminded...


442
00:45:29.266 --> 00:45:31.303
...that you're a part of Mother Earth.

443
00:45:31.989 --> 00:45:36.813
Teach you to be nurturing,
loving, forgiving, self-healing.


444
00:45:38.745 --> 00:45:41.017
Go ahead, make fun of me.

445
00:45:41.797 --> 00:45:45.056
Timing's perfect. 
Must mean something.

446
00:45:45.136 --> 00:45:47.600
Like a scheduled airplane out of the blue.

447
00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:52.129
- Where are they holding the ceremony?
- At Mama Day's farm.


448
00:45:52.209 --> 00:45:54.241
- Not the reservation?
- Not the Res.


449
00:45:54.321 --> 00:45:56.711
Reservation depresses the shit out of me.

450
00:45:58.281 --> 00:46:00.327
You drive.

451
00:46:12.296 --> 00:46:14.132
Hey, ex-convict.

452
00:46:14.646 --> 00:46:15.983
Come here.

453
00:46:20.829 --> 00:46:23.660
- I have a name.
- Well, hell, I don't know it.


454
00:46:30.448 --> 00:46:32.004
It's Max.

455
00:46:32.084 --> 00:46:33.698
Max, huh?

456
00:46:37.154 --> 00:46:39.647
Everybody... meet Max.

457
00:46:40.917 --> 00:46:43.146
- Hi, Max.
- Hey, Max.


458
00:46:43.226 --> 00:46:46.152
- Maxi pad.
- Hi, Max.


459
00:46:48.213 --> 00:46:50.498
Well, there, Max.

460
00:46:51.135 --> 00:46:53.925
You know how I can tell
that you just got out, son?


461
00:46:54.005 --> 00:46:55.655
Well...

462
00:46:55.735 --> 00:46:59.113
...you ever seen an ex-con eat his food?

463
00:46:59.193 --> 00:47:01.827
Yeah, they... well, they guard it, you know?

464
00:47:01.907 --> 00:47:06.701
In a situation, or a scenario, if you will,
when they clearly don't need to...


465
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:10.774
...they wrap it up, hide it...

466
00:47:10.854 --> 00:47:14.922
...like someone's gonna come by and
steal it from them when clearly no one is.


467
00:47:16.238 --> 00:47:17.625
And?

468
00:47:19.681 --> 00:47:21.211
And...

469
00:47:23.504 --> 00:47:24.846
...well, Max.

470
00:47:25.899 --> 00:47:27.907
That's how you are...

471
00:47:28.658 --> 00:47:30.894
...with that pretty little wife of yours.

472
00:47:30.974 --> 00:47:34.315
- She's my wife.
- It's still rude.


473
00:47:34.395 --> 00:47:38.071
Excuse me for trying to protect my wife.
Besides, I don't think she's your type.


474
00:47:38.151 --> 00:47:41.914
- That's no excuse for being rude.
- Ain't no social graces.


475
00:47:41.994 --> 00:47:43.455
Hicks!

476
00:47:44.758 --> 00:47:46.532
Stand down.

477
00:47:49.556 --> 00:47:51.843
Now look at what you gone and done.

478
00:47:52.413 --> 00:47:56.746
You upset my boys here.
I believe this calls for an, uh...


479
00:47:56.826 --> 00:47:59.531
- ...atonement!
- Okay, enough!


480
00:47:59.611 --> 00:48:02.277
We appreciate the fact
that your radio does not work.


481
00:48:02.357 --> 00:48:06.798
What? No, no. The radio works. Right?

482
00:48:06.878 --> 00:48:08.639
It, uh...

483
00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:11.516
- ...well, it doesn't transmit.
- Sure it does. Sure it does.


484
00:48:11.596 --> 00:48:14.956
- I was just using it earlier. I was talking...
- Okay, the radio works?


485
00:48:15.036 --> 00:48:16.361
Yeah!

486
00:48:17.121 --> 00:48:21.453
Uh, no. I meant, um, something else.

487
00:48:21.533 --> 00:48:23.364
Radio's broken.

488
00:48:24.944 --> 00:48:26.451
- I gotta pee!
- Get back here!


489
00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:28.753
- I gotta pee!
- Get back...


490
00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.155
Why you gotta run?

491
00:48:31.235 --> 00:48:33.946
Eze! Get your butt over here.

492
00:48:34.026 --> 00:48:35.227
What?

493
00:48:35.307 --> 00:48:37.629
- Go get him.
- He's peeing.


494
00:48:37.709 --> 00:48:40.973
I don't care!
You ain't holding it for him! Go get him!


495
00:48:41.053 --> 00:48:43.911
- So mean.
- Don't get your ass lost!


496
00:48:43.991 --> 00:48:46.569
- Shut up!
- Go!


497
00:48:50.587 --> 00:48:54.918
I swear, that kid... he'd lose
his head if it wasn't attached.


498
00:48:57.769 --> 00:49:00.060
- You're it.
- Come on, man.


499
00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.056
We don't have BD on our asses,
we can at least have a little fun.


500
00:49:05.836 --> 00:49:07.249
I have fun.

501
00:49:07.329 --> 00:49:09.535
When did you... when was the last time
you really had fun?


502
00:49:09.615 --> 00:49:12.772
I don't know, yesterday
we went fishing, remember that?


503
00:49:12.852 --> 00:49:16.393
Alright, hold on, I'm gonna stop for a minute.
I really actually do have to take a piss.


504
00:49:16.473 --> 00:49:19.064
- You do that.
- I plan to, thank you.


505
00:49:19.144 --> 00:49:21.372
'Preciate your permission to urinate.

506
00:49:29.468 --> 00:49:31.391
Oh, boy... Oh...

507
00:49:31.471 --> 00:49:34.621
- You in dutch with BD, Gord.
- Yeah, no shit.


508
00:49:34.701 --> 00:49:36.179
He gonna hide you.

509
00:49:36.259 --> 00:49:39.341
Yeah, that's why I'm out here
and not with him.


510
00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:45.771
What was that?

511
00:49:46.522 --> 00:49:47.940
Hey!

512
00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:51.419
Ah, shit! Peed on my goddamn leg.

513
00:49:51.499 --> 00:49:53.661
Hey, Critter, what...

514
00:49:54.793 --> 00:49:56.326
Critter?

515
00:49:58.707 --> 00:50:00.304
Critter?

516
00:50:02.068 --> 00:50:03.434
Shit!

517
00:50:08.008 --> 00:50:10.266
Critter, Critter.

518
00:50:13.546 --> 00:50:15.118
Critter?

519
00:50:22.654 --> 00:50:24.386
What...

520
00:51:12.154 --> 00:51:14.752
Fuck you, BD. "Don't get lost."

521
00:51:14.832 --> 00:51:17.766
Fuck you. I do what I want.

522
00:51:24.275 --> 00:51:25.840
Hello?

523
00:51:27.094 --> 00:51:28.683
Critter!

524
00:51:30.097 --> 00:51:32.852
Dammit. Gordy!

525
00:51:33.768 --> 00:51:35.280
Critter!

526
00:51:47.213 --> 00:51:48.726
No.

527
00:51:52.745 --> 00:51:55.675
Critter! Anybody?

528
00:52:17.375 --> 00:52:18.807
Fuck.

529
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:22.322
Dammit!

530
00:53:27.324 --> 00:53:29.537
Oh, God!

531
00:54:24.211 --> 00:54:25.883
You hear that?

532
00:54:25.963 --> 00:54:27.901
Hear what?

533
00:54:28.298 --> 00:54:32.164
Sounds like them boys
is sodomizing each other again!


534
00:54:34.273 --> 00:54:36.594
Sorry we're keeping you.

535
00:54:36.674 --> 00:54:39.195
- What?
- Well, you sound like a man of means.


536
00:54:39.275 --> 00:54:41.634
- Hey, shut up, all of you.
- I was just joking.


537
00:54:41.714 --> 00:54:43.336
- Right.
- I said shut it!


538
00:54:43.416 --> 00:54:48.174
What the fuck is going on?
So the radio works, great! Good news.


539
00:54:48.754 --> 00:54:51.042
Maybe... maybe it doesn't.

540
00:54:52.082 --> 00:54:55.014
Hell, you see,
this here hunting expedition...


541
00:54:55.094 --> 00:54:59.201
...it's not exactly on the up and up.
You know?


542
00:54:59.281 --> 00:55:02.272
So you're keeping your
criminal activities from him?


543
00:55:02.352 --> 00:55:07.246
Yeah, not so much, it's just not wanting
to broadcast it all over the airwaves, alright?


544
00:55:07.326 --> 00:55:10.010
At the gas station, you all were
loading up for a hunting party...


545
00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:13.399
- ...right in front of the sheriff.
- We hadn't killed anything yet.


546
00:55:13.479 --> 00:55:16.776
- You haven't killed anything now.
- Not yet.


547
00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:22.583
Ah, hell, sweet buns.
What are you so concerned about anyway, huh?


548
00:55:22.663 --> 00:55:25.244
We've been more
than accommodating, am I right?


549
00:55:25.324 --> 00:55:27.273
- That's enough!
- Hold on, let me make the call.


550
00:55:27.353 --> 00:55:29.707
We'll just pretend you're not here.
How 'bout that?


551
00:55:30.618 --> 00:55:33.694
Honeybunch, it just don't work that way.

552
00:55:33.774 --> 00:55:37.669
- Then how does it work?
- Well, you see, it works like this.


553
00:55:38.291 --> 00:55:42.131
We have guns! Lots of 'em. You...

554
00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.297
...you ain't even wearing pants!

555
00:55:54.427 --> 00:55:57.096
Jesus, Trout! It wasn't that funny.

556
00:56:11.558 --> 00:56:13.317
What the fuck was that?

557
00:56:16.751 --> 00:56:19.217
- What the fuck was that?
- Easy!


558
00:56:24.835 --> 00:56:26.688
Goddammit, Frank!

559
00:56:34.826 --> 00:56:37.170
Quit shooting, Frank! Dammit!

560
00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:40.129
- Frank!
- Frank, what do you see?


561
00:56:40.209 --> 00:56:42.255
Goddammit! Jesus!

562
00:56:44.841 --> 00:56:47.401
Frank! Quit shooting, goddammit!

563
00:56:48.396 --> 00:56:50.486
Go! Go!

564
00:56:53.612 --> 00:56:55.104
Get the fuck off me!

565
00:56:55.184 --> 00:56:57.128
What do you see, Frank?

566
00:56:58.834 --> 00:57:01.156
Frank! Goddammit, Frank!

567
00:57:01.236 --> 00:57:02.907
What are you shooting at?

568
00:57:44.147 --> 00:57:45.820
Max?

569
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.209
It's me. Wake up. Wake up.

570
01:02:28.631 --> 01:02:30.177
Max.

571
01:02:44.906 --> 01:02:46.452
Ashley.

572
01:02:56.293 --> 01:02:58.311
Oh, Jesus.

573
01:04:01.223 --> 01:04:04.431
- Hey.
- Hi. Oh, so good to see you.


574
01:04:04.511 --> 01:04:06.604
Come on in, see everybody.

575
01:04:08.706 --> 01:04:10.112
Hi.

576
01:04:10.192 --> 01:04:11.977
Nice to have you here.

577
01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:13.906
Please, welcome.

578
01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:18.896
Come on.

579
01:05:18.976 --> 01:05:20.866
We're ready.

580
01:14:56.980 --> 01:14:59.807
Help! Help!

581
01:17:45.732 --> 01:17:47.616
There he is.

582
01:17:50.528 --> 01:17:53.093
- How long was I out?
- All night.


583
01:17:55.473 --> 01:17:57.181
Where's Ashley?

584
01:17:58.597 --> 01:18:00.432
Here's the deal.

585
01:18:01.363 --> 01:18:03.983
There's a creature, lives in these woods...

586
01:18:04.063 --> 01:18:06.323
...as ancient as my tribe remembers.

587
01:18:06.403 --> 01:18:10.546
The legend says that when our chiefs
die, they come back, their spirits...


588
01:18:10.626 --> 01:18:13.620
- ...as the Oh-Mah.
- The what?


589
01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:17.033
It's where the legend
of Sasquatch comes from.


590
01:18:17.113 --> 01:18:19.278
We're talking about Bigfoot?

591
01:18:20.891 --> 01:18:24.523
This woman watches the Oh
-Mah.

592
01:18:24.603 --> 01:18:27.602
She said it stopped at you. 
It got prideful.

593
01:18:27.682 --> 01:18:30.330
Its pride distracted it and it got shot.

594
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:33.470
It's down an arm, which means...

595
01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:36.416
...no arrows,
which means it's out of balance.


596
01:18:36.496 --> 01:18:40.664
Since it's hurt, we stand
a chance to take it down.


597
01:18:40.744 --> 01:18:44.615
She said the Oh
-Mah took your wife, Ashley.

598
01:18:45.542 --> 01:18:48.990
She has a chance if we fight it.

599
01:18:50.202 --> 01:18:52.527
This Oh
-Mah, it's a sentry, sort of...

600
01:18:52.607 --> 01:18:55.723
...watching over the periphery
of the forest where it lives...


601
01:18:55.803 --> 01:19:00.092
...and it has seen the workings
of man's chaos and evil for too long.


602
01:19:01.405 --> 01:19:03.262
It put it out of balance.

603
01:19:03.642 --> 01:19:05.906
So we're talking about a Bigfoot.

604
01:19:05.986 --> 01:19:08.456
- That's what, crazy?
- No.


605
01:19:08.536 --> 01:19:10.266
Well...

606
01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:11.739
...kinda.

607
01:19:11.819 --> 01:19:13.849
Sort of. A lot, actually.

608
01:19:13.929 --> 01:19:17.251
Awesome. I guess
that's just bad luck for us, huh?


609
01:19:17.331 --> 01:19:21.458
Not really. A man out of balance
is easier to knock over.


610
01:19:21.718 --> 01:19:25.142
- Is that Native American wisdom?
- Hell, I just made it up.


611
01:19:25.822 --> 01:19:27.644
So, yeah.

612
01:19:28.224 --> 01:19:30.082
It's time to go, Max.

613
01:19:30.562 --> 01:19:31.927
Now.

614
01:19:33.972 --> 01:19:36.462
These are Oh
-Mah's weapons. We need 'em.

615
01:19:36.542 --> 01:19:37.939
Don't we have guns?

616
01:19:38.019 --> 01:19:42.701
Its primary sense is its sense of smell.
It can smell gunpowder a mile away.


617
01:19:42.781 --> 01:19:45.893
It will stalk you and gut you...

618
01:19:46.303 --> 01:19:48.382
...before you can say...

619
01:20:29.262 --> 01:20:33.544
This will hide your smell.
Get plenty of it on you.


620
01:20:36.718 --> 01:20:38.548
Oh, God.

621
01:22:11.271 --> 01:22:14.344
- We good?
- We bad.


622
01:23:42.052 --> 01:23:45.653
Get off! Get off me! Get off!

623
01:24:01.514 --> 01:24:05.643
Whoever it is, they're coming for you,
asshole! They're coming for you!


624
01:26:20.572 --> 01:26:22.020
So, uh...

625
01:26:22.635 --> 01:26:24.531
...what is the plan?

626
01:26:29.174 --> 01:26:30.822
You find your wife.

627
01:26:33.377 --> 01:26:36.807
You find your wife, you
go back to your boy.

628
01:31:22.048 --> 01:31:23.560
Psst!

629
01:31:56.507 --> 01:31:59.173
Wait. Wait!

630
01:32:23.910 --> 01:32:26.339
Go! Go!

631
01:32:48.518 --> 01:32:52.597
I shot him in the back
and then I got him in the front too.


632
01:32:57.109 --> 01:32:59.198
Go. Go.

633
01:33:01.233 --> 01:33:02.734
Jesus.

634
01:33:03.833 --> 01:33:05.638
Listen to him.

635
01:33:06.509 --> 01:33:08.308
Come on. Come on.

636
01:33:25.988 --> 01:33:27.494
Go.

637
01:33:28.174 --> 01:33:30.047
- No.
- Run as fast as you can.


638
01:33:30.127 --> 01:33:33.025
- No. Absolutely not.
- Don't stop til you get to the road.


639
01:33:34.455 --> 01:33:36.934
- Max, no!
- Ashley!


640
01:33:46.884 --> 01:33:48.343
Go!

641
01:33:48.652 --> 01:33:50.244
Go!

642
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:13.898
Come on. Right here.

643
01:34:13.978 --> 01:34:16.942
Come on! Come here!

644
01:34:27.008 --> 01:34:29.656
That's it. Come here.

645
01:34:29.736 --> 01:34:32.020
Come here! Come on!

646
01:34:37.877 --> 01:34:39.732
Come on!

647
01:34:49.046 --> 01:34:50.490
Come on!

648
01:35:23.256 --> 01:35:24.927
Oh, shit!
