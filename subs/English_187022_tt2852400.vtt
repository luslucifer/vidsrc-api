3
00:01:57.903 --> 00:01:59.530
Stop!

4
00:01:59.613 --> 00:02:01.449
Stop!

5
00:02:10.374 --> 00:02:14.128
Mister, you got some money for us?

6
00:02:14.462 --> 00:02:16.005
Come on.

7
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:18.966
Quick.

8
00:02:21.552 --> 00:02:23.012
Quick!

9
00:05:27.655 --> 00:05:32.243
WUJINSHAN (Black Gold Mountain)

10
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.102
Which way to Wujinshan?

11
00:05:58.185 --> 00:05:59.270
You're here.

12
00:05:59.353 --> 00:06:02.606
- Highway 307?
- This is it.


13
00:07:30.903 --> 00:07:32.071
Dahai

14
00:07:54.343 --> 00:07:56.053
Whose trike is that outside?

15
00:07:56.136 --> 00:07:57.888
I don't know.

16
00:07:57.971 --> 00:07:59.348
No?

17
00:08:01.517 --> 00:08:03.394
Sit down, Dahai.

18
00:08:03.477 --> 00:08:07.189
It's been there two days.
No idea whose it is.


19
00:08:07.272 --> 00:08:10.150
If no one wants it, I'll sell it.

20
00:08:12.986 --> 00:08:16.573
So if the village chief's Audi A6
sat outside his house,


21
00:08:16.657 --> 00:08:18.784
you'd sell that too?

22
00:08:18.867 --> 00:08:19.952
What do you think?

23
00:08:20.035 --> 00:08:23.330
His A6 belongs to everyone in the village.

24
00:08:23.414 --> 00:08:27.167
He sold the state-owned coal mine
so he could afford it.


25
00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:29.753
No wonder the car looks so familiar.

26
00:08:29.837 --> 00:08:32.673
Those shiny wheels are actually mine.

27
00:08:32.756 --> 00:08:35.008
You're smart.

28
00:08:35.092 --> 00:08:36.552
Dahai

29
00:08:36.635 --> 00:08:38.762
A pity you weren't born earlier.

30
00:08:38.846 --> 00:08:40.889
In the war years,

31
00:08:40.973 --> 00:08:44.101
you'd surely have made general.

32
00:08:44.184 --> 00:08:45.644
Just see what happens.

33
00:08:45.727 --> 00:08:48.063
When I report to Beijing,

34
00:08:48.147 --> 00:08:52.151
the chief and the new boss Jiao
will be hauling sand in prison.


35
00:08:52.234 --> 00:08:56.530
Before you even get to Taiyuan,
the chief's men will catch you.


36
00:08:56.613 --> 00:08:59.616
Why do you think I studied law?

37
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.995
The chief sold off
collectively owned property.


38
00:09:03.078 --> 00:09:05.122
He accepted a bribe.

39
00:09:05.205 --> 00:09:07.166
That'll get him 20 years.

40
00:09:07.249 --> 00:09:10.961
As for your boss Jiao Shengli,
he's rolling in it, right?


41
00:09:11.044 --> 00:09:14.590
<i>I'll</i> accuse him of polluting
and covering up accidents in the mine.


42
00:09:14.673 --> 00:09:16.258
They'll close him down.

43
00:09:16.341 --> 00:09:18.760
Believe it.

44
00:09:19.761 --> 00:09:25.601
If the coal mine had gone to you,
you'd have been no different.


45
00:09:25.684 --> 00:09:27.561
I would have.

46
00:09:27.644 --> 00:09:32.232
Jiao's Maserati is parked in the yard.
Nobody uses it.


47
00:09:32.316 --> 00:09:35.652
Drive it off and sell it.
Then you can buy us all a drink.


48
00:09:35.736 --> 00:09:38.071
I don't want his fucking car.

49
00:09:41.116 --> 00:09:44.661
- Sanming. Got the train ticket?
- Yes.


50
00:09:44.745 --> 00:09:47.915
- Where are you going?
- To see my wife for New Year's.


51
00:09:47.998 --> 00:09:50.083
That's romantic.

52
00:09:51.168 --> 00:09:53.170
The police are here.

53
00:09:53.253 --> 00:09:55.088
Stop eating.

54
00:09:57.674 --> 00:09:59.510
Investigation.

55
00:09:59.593 --> 00:10:02.179
Are all the migrant workers here?

56
00:10:02.262 --> 00:10:03.597
Yes. What's wrong?

57
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.017
A murder in Shibawan.
The migrants have to be checked.


58
00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.187
Get them all outside.

59
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.980
Hurry!

60
00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:20.322
Chief.

61
00:10:20.405 --> 00:10:21.532
Village Chief.

62
00:10:21.615 --> 00:10:25.661
When you sold off the coal mine
you promised yearly dividends.


63
00:10:25.744 --> 00:10:27.704
I said that in private.

64
00:10:27.788 --> 00:10:29.623
I don't have time now.

65
00:10:29.706 --> 00:10:33.085
Okay, explain it
to the Discipline Commission.


66
00:10:37.631 --> 00:10:41.635
You've picked
the wrong time for a fight.


67
00:10:42.553 --> 00:10:45.347
You'll be a loser your whole life.

68
00:10:57.901 --> 00:11:01.530
- You won't discuss it?
- You talk too much.


69
00:11:10.497 --> 00:11:14.042
Okay. People from Chongqing.

70
00:11:32.477 --> 00:11:33.687
Over there.

71
00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.022
Next.

72
00:11:56.376 --> 00:11:58.253
He's making a run for it!

73
00:12:19.274 --> 00:12:20.776
Damn animal!

74
00:13:08.031 --> 00:13:09.074
<i>What' s up, Baha'i?</i>

75
00:13:09.157 --> 00:13:11.993
I'm writing to the Discipline Commission

76
00:13:12.077 --> 00:13:15.205
to complain about the chief
and Jiao Shengli.


77
00:13:16.123 --> 00:13:18.625
Miss, a registered letter.

78
00:13:18.709 --> 00:13:22.587
- To whom?
- Beijing. Zhongnanhai. The Commission.


79
00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:25.382
I need the full address.

80
00:13:25.465 --> 00:13:27.300
Zhongnanhai, Beijing.

81
00:13:27.384 --> 00:13:30.595
That's not enough. 
I need the full address.

82
00:13:30.679 --> 00:13:33.974
What? Everyone knows Zhongnanhai.

83
00:13:34.057 --> 00:13:36.059
That's not enough.

84
00:13:36.143 --> 00:13:39.020
Miss, are you siding
with the village chief?


85
00:13:39.104 --> 00:13:41.440
Does he give you kickbacks?

86
00:13:41.523 --> 00:13:45.527
Or are you Jiao's mistress?
Has he bought you a car?


87
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.654
You're crazy! Go away!

88
00:13:48.447 --> 00:13:50.907
You two must be in league.

89
00:13:50.991 --> 00:13:52.868
There's no justice!

90
00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:54.202
No justice!

91
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.580
No justice.

92
00:14:07.174 --> 00:14:11.094
All aboard! We're leaving, hurry!

93
00:14:11.178 --> 00:14:14.014
Dahai, come on!

94
00:14:15.474 --> 00:14:16.558
What's this for?

95
00:14:16.641 --> 00:14:20.729
Greeting Boss Jiao.
One bag of flour per person.


96
00:14:26.485 --> 00:14:30.405
Boss Jiao has a new private plane.
He's flying back from Hong Kong.


97
00:14:30.489 --> 00:14:33.825
We're a welcoming group.
Everyone gets a bag of flour.


98
00:14:33.909 --> 00:14:37.287
A plane?
Living on this earth isn't enough?


99
00:14:41.875 --> 00:14:44.628
Were you at the coal mine
when the gun was fired?


100
00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:46.254
Yes.

101
00:14:47.088 --> 00:14:49.216
Who was the guy who ran away?

102
00:14:49.299 --> 00:14:52.844
A loader in the coal yard. From Sichuan.

103
00:14:52.928 --> 00:14:56.598
Why did he run? 
The killings in Shibawan?

104
00:14:56.681 --> 00:14:58.850
He's an escaped prisoner.

105
00:14:58.934 --> 00:15:02.062
Killed someone in his hometown.
He's been hiding here.


106
00:15:02.145 --> 00:15:03.980
He thought they'd come for him.

107
00:15:04.064 --> 00:15:06.483
He panicked and ran.

108
00:15:06.566 --> 00:15:10.028
- Did they catch him?
- Of course.


109
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.117
- What happened in Shibawan?
- Don't you know?


110
00:15:16.201 --> 00:15:20.872
Someone shot three guys yesterday.
Three dead in Shibawan.


111
00:15:20.956 --> 00:15:23.500
- Who did it?
- I don't know.


112
00:15:23.583 --> 00:15:28.421
Early this morning,
a bunch of armed police were in Shibawan.


113
00:15:29.256 --> 00:15:31.424
I see.

114
00:15:34.678 --> 00:15:38.265
Accountant Liu,
are your accounts up to date?


115
00:15:40.016 --> 00:15:44.062
When Boss Jiao got
hold of the coal mine

116
00:15:44.145 --> 00:15:47.649
he said 40% of the profits
would go to the village.


117
00:15:47.732 --> 00:15:52.320
How much do the last

118
00:15:52.404 --> 00:15:55.448
Listen, back in 2001,

119
00:15:55.532 --> 00:15:59.077
the village committee
signed to sell the coal mine.


120
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:01.162
Who asked you to sell it?

121
00:16:01.246 --> 00:16:03.498
Was the contract discussed?

122
00:16:03.582 --> 00:16:05.834
We must keep our word.

123
00:16:05.917 --> 00:16:10.881
But Jiao got so rich
he even bought a plane.


124
00:16:10.964 --> 00:16:13.008
He's a hard worker.

125
00:16:13.091 --> 00:16:19.222
Then tell me how much you
and the chief took in bribes.


126
00:16:19.306 --> 00:16:21.474
Stop, please.

127
00:16:23.143 --> 00:16:26.062
Tell me how much you took in bribes.

128
00:16:26.146 --> 00:16:27.689
Open the door.

129
00:16:27.772 --> 00:16:32.444
Devils like you are more evil
than the village chief and Jiao.


130
00:16:38.825 --> 00:16:42.495
- Listen to me -
- Don't talk to me.


131
00:16:51.171 --> 00:16:54.090
Everyone, repeat after me.

132
00:16:54.507 --> 00:16:55.592
Welcome! Welcome!

133
00:16:55.675 --> 00:16:57.218
A warm welcome!

134
00:17:00.555 --> 00:17:01.973
Good.

135
00:17:03.141 --> 00:17:05.101
Here's the plane!

136
00:18:02.575 --> 00:18:05.662
Mr. Jiao, you've reached a new level.

137
00:18:05.745 --> 00:18:08.415
Let's progress together.

138
00:18:08.498 --> 00:18:10.750
Congratulations, ma'am.

139
00:18:10.834 --> 00:18:12.585
Kids, the flowers.

140
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.972
Mr. Jiao, look this way.

141
00:18:26.599 --> 00:18:29.019
A bit closer, please.

142
00:18:29.936 --> 00:18:33.273
- Please say something, sir.
- Later.


143
00:18:44.951 --> 00:18:46.953
How are you, Auntie?

144
00:18:50.915 --> 00:18:52.709
Thanks for coming.

145
00:18:52.792 --> 00:18:54.711
Long time no see.

146
00:18:54.794 --> 00:18:57.380
- Shengli!
- Dahai.


147
00:18:57.464 --> 00:18:59.549
Congratulations.

148
00:18:59.632 --> 00:19:01.551
Thank you, Dahai.

149
00:19:01.634 --> 00:19:03.762
You're a hard man to reach.

150
00:19:03.845 --> 00:19:05.889
There's something I want to discuss.

151
00:19:05.972 --> 00:19:07.932
Can you do me a favor?

152
00:19:08.016 --> 00:19:09.934
Whatever you need, just ask.

153
00:19:10.018 --> 00:19:11.853
Sponsor my journey to Beijing

154
00:19:11.936 --> 00:19:15.356
to file accusations
against you and the village chief.


155
00:19:15.857 --> 00:19:18.651
Sure, come and pick it up later.

156
00:19:18.735 --> 00:19:21.112
Here, in front of all these villagers,

157
00:19:21.196 --> 00:19:24.365
can't you discuss the village economy?

158
00:19:28.036 --> 00:19:30.330
What are you staring at?

159
00:20:09.369 --> 00:20:12.580
Xiao Bai, are you playing golf?

160
00:20:44.571 --> 00:20:48.408
I'm hereto compensate you
on behalf of the Shengli Group.


161
00:21:08.595 --> 00:21:10.430
Case closed.

162
00:22:51.406 --> 00:22:53.116
Where's your mother?

163
00:22:53.199 --> 00:22:56.786
- Who are you?
- Don't you remember me?


164
00:22:56.869 --> 00:23:00.623
I'm your uncle from Wujinshan.

165
00:23:00.707 --> 00:23:04.127
Morn went out for food.
She'll be back soon.


166
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:12.218
Animal.

167
00:23:15.305 --> 00:23:17.265
Where's your dad?

168
00:23:17.348 --> 00:23:20.601
Out hunting “animals.”

169
00:23:20.685 --> 00:23:22.770
On which mountain?

170
00:23:22.854 --> 00:23:24.564
Jiaokou.

171
00:23:26.774 --> 00:23:28.526
Dahai

172
00:23:29.235 --> 00:23:30.570
You've -

173
00:23:32.071 --> 00:23:34.240
When did you get here?

174
00:23:34.324 --> 00:23:36.993
I've been in town a couple of days.

175
00:23:37.618 --> 00:23:39.579
Let's go inside.

176
00:23:40.121 --> 00:23:42.790
Ganggang. Eat first, then homework.

177
00:23:42.874 --> 00:23:44.876
Of course, Mom.

178
00:23:45.835 --> 00:23:47.712
You're -

179
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.257
Tell me.

180
00:23:55.345 --> 00:23:59.057
A while back,
I introduced you to a woman from Wangcun.


181
00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.184
You were well matched.

182
00:24:01.267 --> 00:24:02.477
But you -

183
00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.646
Why didn't you date her, as arranged?

184
00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.817
You never think about your life.

185
00:24:12.612 --> 00:24:14.989
All you do is make accusations.

186
00:24:15.073 --> 00:24:18.743
Even if your charges stick, you'll grow old.

187
00:24:18.826 --> 00:24:22.663
I'm already old. 
But I don't care.

188
00:24:22.747 --> 00:24:24.540
Don't be silly.

189
00:24:24.624 --> 00:24:27.293
You're only middle-aged.

190
00:24:32.465 --> 00:24:34.842
The kid's here.

191
00:24:36.928 --> 00:24:39.180
I'm at fault here.

192
00:24:39.263 --> 00:24:41.391
You really are hopeless.

193
00:24:41.474 --> 00:24:44.435
I told you when
we were still at school.

194
00:24:44.519 --> 00:24:47.230
There's more to life than getting rich.

195
00:24:47.313 --> 00:24:50.900
You want to be more evil
than Jiao Shengli?


196
00:24:50.983 --> 00:24:53.236
How can you compare me with him?

197
00:24:53.319 --> 00:24:55.488
If not him, then who?

198
00:24:55.571 --> 00:24:57.740
You and he were classmates.

199
00:24:57.824 --> 00:25:02.328
Look what he's made of himself
compared to us here.


200
00:25:02.995 --> 00:25:07.625
You have your own place in Wujinshan.

201
00:25:07.708 --> 00:25:13.589
But my husband and I
don't even have a home of our own.


202
00:25:15.466 --> 00:25:16.926
Enough of this.

203
00:25:17.009 --> 00:25:20.346
If you have time on your hands,
why not open a restaurant?


204
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:23.641
Or a shop?
To earn money and get married.


205
00:25:23.724 --> 00:25:28.020
Your life belongs to you.
Stop caring what others do.


206
00:25:31.774 --> 00:25:34.735
My dear, wait and see.

207
00:25:34.819 --> 00:25:39.407
I can be more evil
than the village chief or Jiao.


208
00:26:09.979 --> 00:26:11.898
Isn't that Mr. Golf?

209
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.611
- What did you call me?
- Mr. Golf.


210
00:26:16.694 --> 00:26:20.156
Everyone calls you Mr. Golf now.
Didn't you know?


211
00:26:39.675 --> 00:26:41.260
Mr. Golf!

212
00:26:56.025 --> 00:26:57.568
I...

213
00:27:00.029 --> 00:27:01.364
Lin Chong...

214
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:08.412
unsheathed my sword and, in anger,

215
00:27:08.496 --> 00:27:11.332
slew two of Gao Qiu's henchmen.

216
00:27:11.415 --> 00:27:13.918
Fortunately for me,

217
00:27:14.001 --> 00:27:16.546
Officer Chai gave me a document

218
00:27:16.629 --> 00:27:20.716
which enabled me to come to Mount Liang.

219
00:29:29.929 --> 00:29:31.681
Good morning.

220
00:29:32.306 --> 00:29:33.599
Dahai, good morning.

221
00:29:33.683 --> 00:29:35.726
I want a word with your husband.

222
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:37.645
Go ahead.

223
00:29:48.364 --> 00:29:49.907
Write.

224
00:29:53.536 --> 00:29:55.287
Write what?

225
00:29:57.957 --> 00:30:01.168
You know how much
the village chief embezzled.


226
00:30:01.252 --> 00:30:04.630
- Write a confession.
- You're being ridiculous.


227
00:30:13.305 --> 00:30:15.850
What are you doing? 
That's dangerous.

228
00:30:16.892 --> 00:30:18.728
Write it down.

229
00:30:21.647 --> 00:30:23.315
Write!

230
00:30:33.951 --> 00:30:35.327
Write.

231
00:31:00.352 --> 00:31:01.729
Shoot

232
00:31:04.023 --> 00:31:05.608
Shoot me here.

233
00:31:19.246 --> 00:31:22.166
You're too much of
a coward to kill me.

234
00:32:53.007 --> 00:32:56.093
Village Chief. it's Liuliu.

235
00:32:56.176 --> 00:32:58.137
I just started work.

236
00:32:59.638 --> 00:33:01.807
What do you want done?

237
00:33:03.976 --> 00:33:07.271
Okay, don't worry.
<i>I'll</i> do it this afternoon.


238
00:33:08.397 --> 00:33:10.149
Mr. Golf.

239
00:33:10.232 --> 00:33:12.401
- Where's the chief?
- At the temple.


240
00:33:15.446 --> 00:33:18.490
What did you just call me?

241
00:33:18.949 --> 00:33:20.242
Mr. Golf.

242
00:33:20.326 --> 00:33:22.995
Isn't that your foreign name?

243
00:33:23.078 --> 00:33:24.747
Little bastard.

244
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.498
What did you say?

245
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.236
- Dahai.
- Where are you off to?


246
00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:59.990
Fengjie. Going hunting?

247
00:34:00.074 --> 00:34:01.825
Hunting animals.

248
00:34:22.805 --> 00:34:24.890
Stop fooling around.

249
00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.235
Calm down.

250
00:34:37.486 --> 00:34:40.572
Let's sit down and talk.

251
00:34:41.073 --> 00:34:42.866
We can sort it out.

252
00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:04.680
Listen, don't be impulsive.

253
00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:16.442
Let's sit down.

254
00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.946
Bastard!

255
00:37:29.449 --> 00:37:31.201
Dahai?

256
00:37:44.882 --> 00:37:46.884
How can we fix this?

257
00:37:46.967 --> 00:37:48.135
Just tell me.

258
00:39:49.256 --> 00:39:50.716
Hey.

259
00:39:52.384 --> 00:39:54.678
You got a light?

260
00:39:54.761 --> 00:39:56.221
No.

261
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:14.072
Motorcycle taxi.

262
00:40:27.919 --> 00:40:30.339
- Where to, buddy?
- The expressway.


263
00:40:30.422 --> 00:40:32.341
Let's go.

264
00:40:57.574 --> 00:41:02.329
<i>Our Mrs. Zhou here
worked hard to raise her children.</i>


265
00:41:02.412 --> 00:41:04.623
<i>Now it's her 70th birthday,</i>

266
00:41:04.706 --> 00:41:08.835
<i>so lefs wish her happiness,
good health and a long life.</i>


267
00:41:11.129 --> 00:41:15.008
<i>And now, let's welcome
her second son and his family,</i>


268
00:41:15.092 --> 00:41:17.135
<i>with their birthday greetings.</i>

269
00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:19.221
San'er is here!

270
00:41:21.014 --> 00:41:23.266
The youngest son is back.

271
00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:33.735
You're back.

272
00:41:33.819 --> 00:41:35.821
Brother.

273
00:41:53.839 --> 00:41:56.425
Why are you running off?

274
00:41:56.508 --> 00:41:58.051
Come here.

275
00:42:04.057 --> 00:42:05.308
Mother.

276
00:42:20.907 --> 00:42:22.409
Don't cry.

277
00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.957
Where did you come from?

278
00:43:15.003 --> 00:43:17.255
I came by boat.

279
00:43:18.673 --> 00:43:20.383
And before that?

280
00:43:25.555 --> 00:43:27.349
I got your money transfers.

281
00:43:27.432 --> 00:43:29.476
130,000 yuan in all.

282
00:43:32.103 --> 00:43:33.897
That's right.

283
00:43:37.275 --> 00:43:41.154
The most recent one came from Shanxi.

284
00:44:02.634 --> 00:44:06.429
I earned it in Wuhan
and sent it from Shanxi.


285
00:44:11.851 --> 00:44:13.770
I don't want your money.

286
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.797
Your brothers are coming.

287
00:45:12.162 --> 00:45:16.166
Mother's birthday was on the 7th day
of the 11th lunar month.


288
00:45:16.249 --> 00:45:20.337
But we two had to work that day.
We couldn't get home.


289
00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:23.632
Our relatives couldn't get here either.

290
00:45:24.382 --> 00:45:26.843
Since New Year is now
and many people come home,


291
00:45:26.926 --> 00:45:29.471
we decided to celebrate today.

292
00:45:32.432 --> 00:45:37.062
I'll go through it for you both.

293
00:45:37.604 --> 00:45:40.273
For Mother's 70th birthday celebrations

294
00:45:40.357 --> 00:45:46.237
we received gifts of money
totaling 10,270 yuan.


295
00:45:47.739 --> 00:45:49.866
12 tables of guests.

296
00:45:49.949 --> 00:45:53.995
To buy meat, vegetables,
wine and cigarettes,


297
00:45:54.079 --> 00:45:58.917
the total cost
was 6,477 yuan and 33 cents.


298
00:45:59.918 --> 00:46:03.004
I hired a host for 800 yuan.

299
00:46:03.088 --> 00:46:05.799
Taking all expenses into account,

300
00:46:05.882 --> 00:46:11.179
I had to spend
7,485 yuan and 42 cents.

301
00:46:11.262 --> 00:46:13.473
That was the total cost.

302
00:46:15.517 --> 00:46:19.896
What's left is 2,784 yuan and 58 cents.

303
00:46:21.106 --> 00:46:23.983
This money, the way I see it,

304
00:46:24.067 --> 00:46:27.195
should be shared
between us three and Mother.


305
00:46:27.278 --> 00:46:28.780
A quarter each.

306
00:46:28.863 --> 00:46:32.867
I've already divided it
into four equal shares.


307
00:46:33.618 --> 00:46:36.287
- Right, Second Brother?
- Yes.


308
00:46:37.622 --> 00:46:40.875
I don't need a share.
Give mine to Mother.


309
00:46:47.132 --> 00:46:51.803
I bought ten packs of cigarettes.
A good brand.


310
00:46:53.555 --> 00:46:55.682
There are nine left.

311
00:46:55.765 --> 00:46:59.144
So, that makes three each.

312
00:47:01.855 --> 00:47:06.735
As the oldest brother
I have to be impartial.


313
00:47:08.695 --> 00:47:11.865
If you want your
share to go to Mother,

314
00:47:12.407 --> 00:47:14.576
give it to her yourself.

315
00:47:49.027 --> 00:47:52.155
People usually worship the gods tomorrow.

316
00:47:53.656 --> 00:47:56.034
I'm worshiping ghosts.

317
00:48:28.316 --> 00:48:31.569
The gods were to blame.

318
00:48:32.403 --> 00:48:35.698
If you have any grievances,
tell heaven about them.


319
00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.805
Is Qinqin in Dongguan?
Didn't she come back with you?


320
00:49:40.889 --> 00:49:43.349
She's gone to Zhongshan.

321
00:49:43.725 --> 00:49:44.851
She won't be back.

322
00:49:46.644 --> 00:49:49.022
She tested HIV positive.

323
00:49:49.647 --> 00:49:51.524
AIDS?

324
00:49:52.025 --> 00:49:54.569
Didn't she work in a factory?

325
00:49:55.236 --> 00:49:58.907
Impossible to make a decent living.

326
00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:03.536
Lili has a hair salon in Zhongshan,
so Qinqin went to work there.


327
00:50:04.495 --> 00:50:09.000
She provided “special services.”
That's how she got AIDS.


328
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:10.627
Bloody...

329
00:50:11.461 --> 00:50:13.212
you slept with her once.

330
00:50:13.296 --> 00:50:15.840
You'd better have a check-up.

331
00:50:16.382 --> 00:50:18.343
Don't talk crap.

332
00:50:18.426 --> 00:50:21.763
Get a check-up, quick. 
Good luck with it.

333
00:50:21.846 --> 00:50:26.768
What's your wife up to in Tianjin
while you're stuck here?


334
00:50:26.851 --> 00:50:29.479
You should get her checked up.

335
00:50:29.562 --> 00:50:31.773
- Maybe you have HIV.
- What?


336
00:50:31.856 --> 00:50:33.983
You should keep your mouth shut.

337
00:50:34.067 --> 00:50:36.110
You want to die?

338
00:50:36.444 --> 00:50:39.072
Scumbag! Let's settle this right now!

339
00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:42.241
Action? Let's see it, then.

340
00:50:42.325 --> 00:50:45.912
Only 78 minutes to go
till the New Year bell.


341
00:50:46.412 --> 00:50:49.374
Think you can take me?

342
00:52:24.093 --> 00:52:27.013
- Shall we set off a firework?
- Great!


343
00:52:32.852 --> 00:52:34.520
Watch.

344
00:53:06.052 --> 00:53:08.763
Tickets to Guangzhou, 240 yuan.

345
00:53:08.846 --> 00:53:11.891
Wuhan. Anybody for Wuhan?

346
00:53:16.604 --> 00:53:18.272
Want a ticket?

347
00:53:18.356 --> 00:53:21.359
- To Nanning?
- Yes, how many?


348
00:53:21.442 --> 00:53:23.653
Where else?

349
00:53:23.736 --> 00:53:25.363
Yichang.

350
00:53:27.782 --> 00:53:31.285
One each for Guangzhou,
Yichang and Nanning.


351
00:53:31.369 --> 00:53:34.163
Wait for me on the bridge.
<i>I'll</i> bring them.


352
00:53:34.247 --> 00:53:37.041
- Be quick.
- Okay, wait for me.


353
00:53:39.877 --> 00:53:42.839
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

354
00:53:44.215 --> 00:53:47.135
<i>Chongqing Railway Station reminds you</i>

355
00:53:47.218 --> 00:53:50.054
<i>that during this holiday congestion</i>

356
00:53:50.138 --> 00:53:52.515
<i>it is strictly prohibited
to carry combustible materials</i>


357
00:53:52.598 --> 00:53:56.435
<i>as well as firearms and knives.</i>

358
00:54:01.941 --> 00:54:04.318
Will you go to Guangzhou,

359
00:54:04.402 --> 00:54:06.404
Yichang,

360
00:54:06.904 --> 00:54:08.656
or Nanning?

361
00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.096
You've looked in my bag?

362
00:54:37.435 --> 00:54:42.106
Not sure yet. I'd
like to go to Burma.

363
00:54:47.153 --> 00:54:51.115
You can't stay here in the village?

364
00:55:02.084 --> 00:55:04.295
It's boring.

365
00:55:05.963 --> 00:55:08.466
What isn't boring?

366
00:55:12.803 --> 00:55:15.932
Shooting guns isn't boring.

367
00:55:20.895 --> 00:55:24.398
What would you do in Burma?

368
00:55:34.659 --> 00:55:37.912
I'd buy a new fast-loading pistol.

369
00:55:41.958 --> 00:55:45.962
You should buy a cell phone.
Then I could call you.


370
00:55:50.716 --> 00:55:52.301
No way.

371
00:55:52.385 --> 00:55:54.387
Too dangerous.

372
00:57:02.705 --> 00:57:05.041
Can I help you?

373
00:57:06.542 --> 00:57:08.586
Just looking.

374
00:57:18.262 --> 00:57:20.181
Feel free.

375
00:57:20.973 --> 00:57:24.185
- Where's the bathroom?
- Over there.


376
00:57:24.268 --> 00:57:27.104
Can you watch my
bag? <i>I'll</i> be right back.

377
00:57:27.188 --> 00:57:29.315
All right.

378
00:59:18.257 --> 00:59:22.303
- Go ahead and start the car.
- Be careful.


379
00:59:37.276 --> 00:59:39.153
Xiaoyan.

380
00:59:39.236 --> 00:59:42.406
- Where are you going?
- To get her immunized.


381
00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:44.950
Time for her shot?

382
00:59:45.034 --> 00:59:46.368
Afraid?

383
00:59:46.452 --> 00:59:47.786
Say no.

384
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:50.289
- How are things?
- As usual.


385
00:59:50.372 --> 00:59:51.624
Let's have tea sometime.

386
00:59:51.707 --> 00:59:53.459
<i>I'll</i> call you.

387
01:01:58.042 --> 01:02:00.711
Driver, stop here.

388
01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:05.799
Stop.

389
01:02:05.883 --> 01:02:07.926
I can't, till the next rest area.

390
01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:09.845
Stop here.

391
01:03:41.645 --> 01:03:43.731
Traffic jam?

392
01:03:43.814 --> 01:03:46.316
Small delay in Tianmen.

393
01:03:48.402 --> 01:03:50.821
When did you get here?

394
01:03:51.363 --> 01:03:53.031
Just now.

395
01:04:01.123 --> 01:04:03.125
You're frowning.

396
01:04:08.672 --> 01:04:10.048
To get to the station?

397
01:04:10.132 --> 01:04:13.719
I booked a black car.
The driver's waiting.


398
01:04:19.099 --> 01:04:22.561
Driver Wang? it's me.

399
01:04:22.644 --> 01:04:24.354
Car booked for Xiaoyu.

400
01:04:24.438 --> 01:04:26.565
You can come now.

401
01:04:26.648 --> 01:04:28.192
Okay.

402
01:04:34.865 --> 01:04:36.909
Did you tell her?

403
01:04:43.123 --> 01:04:45.000
I started to.

404
01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:48.337
What did you say?

405
01:04:50.297 --> 01:04:51.965
I hinted.

406
01:04:55.636 --> 01:04:57.930
You're delaying again.

407
01:05:03.185 --> 01:05:05.562
She must have understood.

408
01:05:14.196 --> 01:05:16.448
Come to Guangzhou with me.

409
01:05:23.038 --> 01:05:25.499
I've been with you so many years.

410
01:05:25.582 --> 01:05:27.709
Why do I wait?

411
01:05:28.585 --> 01:05:31.004
I accept things the way they are.

412
01:05:31.088 --> 01:05:33.257
But I owe my parents an explanation.

413
01:05:56.530 --> 01:05:58.532
I want a baby.

414
01:06:06.582 --> 01:06:08.625
Let's go to Guangzhou together.

415
01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:24.725
Either you stay with your wife
and we separate,


416
01:06:24.808 --> 01:06:28.979
or you divorce her and we live together.

417
01:06:30.814 --> 01:06:32.691
You have to choose.

418
01:06:36.153 --> 01:06:38.322
Let's go together.

419
01:06:44.828 --> 01:06:49.041
Once you get back to Guangzhou,
<i>I'll</i> give you six months.


420
01:06:51.168 --> 01:06:55.255
We can both think it over,
then make the decision.


421
01:07:39.508 --> 01:07:42.302
Sir, there's a problem with your bag.

422
01:07:42.386 --> 01:07:44.388
Please come to have it checked.

423
01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.443
Open the bag.

424
01:08:07.411 --> 01:08:09.329
You can't take this on the train.

425
01:08:09.413 --> 01:08:12.791
- It's a fruit knife.
- It's not permitted.


426
01:08:12.874 --> 01:08:16.336
- Why not?
- Regulations.


427
01:08:16.837 --> 01:08:18.839
What if I eat an apple?

428
01:08:18.922 --> 01:08:21.008
Eat it with the peel.

429
01:08:23.969 --> 01:08:26.763
Give it to me, <i>I'll</i> take it.

430
01:08:27.431 --> 01:08:29.349
Then you can't go.

431
01:08:30.142 --> 01:08:31.351
I'm not going.

432
01:08:31.435 --> 01:08:33.562
Or enter the station.

433
01:08:36.398 --> 01:08:38.275
Forget the knife.

434
01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:46.074
Your ID card?

435
01:08:57.294 --> 01:08:59.087
<i>I'll</i> leave first.

436
01:09:00.213 --> 01:09:03.050
Call me when you get there.

437
01:10:28.718 --> 01:10:33.515
<i>This is your final call for train 934</i>

438
01:10:33.598 --> 01:10:38.937
<i>from Yichang East to Guangzhou East.</i>

439
01:12:50.443 --> 01:12:53.613
<i>Fellow countrymen in Yuanshan village,</i>

440
01:12:53.697 --> 01:12:56.866
<i>come and have a look!</i>

441
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:59.577
<i>Roll up, roll up!</i>

442
01:12:59.661 --> 01:13:03.498
<i>See the holy snakes. 
See the beauty.</i>

443
01:13:03.581 --> 01:13:06.626
<i>A marriage is to be.</i>

444
01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:09.879
<i>The holy snakes foretell weal and woe.</i>

445
01:13:09.963 --> 01:13:12.674
<i>Roll up, roll up!</i>

446
01:13:12.757 --> 01:13:16.636
<i>See the holy snakes. 
See the beauty.</i>

447
01:13:37.657 --> 01:13:41.244
NIGHT
-COMER SAUNA

448
01:14:12.692 --> 01:14:15.945
Good evening, sir. 
Overnight or sauna?

449
01:14:21.117 --> 01:14:23.703
- Are you Xiaoyu?
- Yes.


450
01:14:23.787 --> 01:14:25.705
I'm Zhang Youliang's wife.

451
01:14:25.789 --> 01:14:27.332
Bitch!

452
01:14:51.815 --> 01:14:55.151
Shameless whore! <i>I'll</i> beat you to death!

453
01:14:55.235 --> 01:14:59.364
Did your mother give birth to you
just to seduce my husband?


454
01:17:25.677 --> 01:17:28.221
Number 11, your turn.

455
01:18:42.378 --> 01:18:44.047
Thank you.

456
01:18:49.385 --> 01:18:51.471
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.


457
01:19:33.805 --> 01:19:36.140
You have been there a long time.

458
01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.394
You know the ropes.

459
01:19:43.398 --> 01:19:45.358
If you don't know the ropes here...

460
01:19:46.275 --> 01:19:48.361
you won't earn much.

461
01:19:49.946 --> 01:19:51.739
I'd rather stay here.

462
01:20:00.623 --> 01:20:03.543
When will this airport be finished?

463
01:20:04.127 --> 01:20:07.380
They're working on the runway first.

464
01:20:07.463 --> 01:20:11.718
When that's finished,
most of the workers will leave.


465
01:20:11.801 --> 01:20:13.803
I'll leave too.

466
01:20:20.810 --> 01:20:22.228
Mom...

467
01:20:23.229 --> 01:20:25.898
I saw Dad in Yichang.

468
01:20:32.864 --> 01:20:34.949
I don't want to hear about him.

469
01:20:58.347 --> 01:21:01.017
Incredible! How could this happen?

470
01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:02.310
<i>At 8:38 p.m. yesterday,</i>

471
01:21:02.393 --> 01:21:07.356
<i>the Beijing to Fuzhou train
reached Shangyu, in Wenzhou.</i>


472
01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:12.069
<i>There it ran into a stationary train
going from Hangzhou to Fuzhou.</i>


473
01:21:12.153 --> 01:21:17.992
<i>The collision caused the first four carriages
to plunge from the viaduct.</i>


474
01:21:18.075 --> 01:21:20.620
<i>Two carriages from the other train also fell.</i>

475
01:21:20.703 --> 01:21:24.123
<i>The current death toll stands at 35.</i>

476
01:21:24.207 --> 01:21:27.960
<i>Nineteen have been identified.
They include two foreigners.</i>


477
01:21:28.044 --> 01:21:30.463
<i>In all, 210 people were injured.</i>

478
01:22:04.455 --> 01:22:06.082
- Pay the toll.
- What toll?


479
01:22:06.165 --> 01:22:07.500
Transit fee, 10 yuan.

480
01:22:07.583 --> 01:22:10.503
- We work at the airport site.
- You're most liable.


481
01:22:10.586 --> 01:22:14.048
When your trucks pass through our town,
you leave potholes.


482
01:22:14.131 --> 01:22:15.925
From today you have to pay.

483
01:22:16.008 --> 01:22:18.928
- I don't drive the trucks.
- It makes no difference.


484
01:22:32.275 --> 01:22:34.360
You work at the airport?

485
01:22:34.443 --> 01:22:37.029
I'll pay if you give me a receipt.

486
01:22:38.656 --> 01:22:40.491
Receipt?

487
01:22:46.956 --> 01:22:48.583
Receipt.

488
01:22:52.503 --> 01:22:54.255
Take care of this guy.

489
01:23:17.069 --> 01:23:18.779
Stop it, you'll kill him!

490
01:23:20.823 --> 01:23:23.242
<i>Can an animal commit suicide?</i>

491
01:23:23.326 --> 01:23:26.579
<i>For those who think that humans</i>

492
01:23:26.662 --> 01:23:31.375
<i>are the only advanced creatures
on earth -</i>


493
01:23:34.754 --> 01:23:37.173
Xiaoyu, your shift's over.

494
01:23:38.257 --> 01:23:40.259
Did you know animals commit suicide?

495
01:23:40.343 --> 01:23:42.887
So they don't know the saying:

496
01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:45.556
Better to live miserable than die happy.

497
01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:47.850
Animals wouldn't agree.

498
01:24:05.701 --> 01:24:08.037
Good evening, gentlemen.

499
01:24:11.791 --> 01:24:14.377
Sauna or overnight?

500
01:24:18.047 --> 01:24:20.716
Sauna, then give us a room.

501
01:24:22.009 --> 01:24:24.804
Sauna. Two guests for sauna.

502
01:25:38.669 --> 01:25:41.213
Washing clothes?

503
01:25:41.297 --> 01:25:42.298
Yes.

504
01:25:43.299 --> 01:25:45.551
What's your employee number?

505
01:25:45.885 --> 01:25:47.470
I don't have one.

506
01:25:49.472 --> 01:25:51.307
Give me a massage.

507
01:25:54.101 --> 01:25:56.187
Please go to the third floor.

508
01:25:56.270 --> 01:25:59.398
- The masseuses are there.
- I want an untrained person.


509
01:25:59.482 --> 01:26:02.068
Give me a full set. I'll tip you.

510
01:26:03.611 --> 01:26:07.573
Sorry, sir, I'm a receptionist,
not a masseuse.


511
01:26:07.656 --> 01:26:10.367
Receptionist? Then why are you up here?

512
01:26:12.745 --> 01:26:14.413
Sorry.

513
01:26:31.263 --> 01:26:33.015
What do you mean by that?

514
01:26:33.099 --> 01:26:35.101
Nothing.

515
01:26:49.865 --> 01:26:51.450
Don't look down on me.

516
01:26:51.534 --> 01:26:54.620
- You'll be well paid.
- Get out.


517
01:26:54.703 --> 01:26:57.540
Fuck. Stop pretending.

518
01:26:58.207 --> 01:27:00.876
- <i>I'll</i> have you.
- I'm not a masseuse!


519
01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.004
Then why are you in a sauna?

520
01:27:04.088 --> 01:27:05.673
- Get out.
- Fuck.


521
01:27:05.756 --> 01:27:08.217
You've had too many pretty boys, eh?

522
01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:09.802
We can afford you.

523
01:27:09.885 --> 01:27:12.888
I'm not a prostitute.
Go home to your wives.


524
01:27:26.527 --> 01:27:29.738
- Now what?
- I'm having you!


525
01:27:30.573 --> 01:27:33.200
- No, you're not!
- I'm not?


526
01:27:34.994 --> 01:27:37.204
- I have money.
- Money can't buy everything!


527
01:27:37.288 --> 01:27:40.583
I have money.
Isn't it good enough?


528
01:27:43.210 --> 01:27:45.588
It's not fucking good enough?

529
01:27:47.798 --> 01:27:50.259
I'll smother you in it!

530
01:27:50.342 --> 01:27:51.635
Not a prostitute?

531
01:27:51.719 --> 01:27:54.180
I'll smother you in money!

532
01:27:56.932 --> 01:27:58.142
Bitch!

533
01:27:58.225 --> 01:28:00.728
I have fucking money!

534
01:28:03.439 --> 01:28:04.773
Fuck!

535
01:28:05.649 --> 01:28:06.859
Fuck you!

536
01:28:06.942 --> 01:28:09.486
Isn't my money good enough?

537
01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:11.739
It's not good enough?

538
01:28:14.241 --> 01:28:16.744
Not a prostitute? Who is, then?

539
01:31:42.658 --> 01:31:46.620
<i>Hello, this is
the 110 emergency call line.</i>


540
01:31:54.336 --> 01:31:56.672
I've killed someone.

541
01:33:04.072 --> 01:33:06.074
Hands off my phone.

542
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:08.494
Where's the GPS?

543
01:33:09.369 --> 01:33:12.331
You want GPS, buy a fucking BMW.

544
01:33:12.414 --> 01:33:16.418
I'm going to see my buddy in Dongguan.
I don't know the way.


545
01:33:16.752 --> 01:33:20.714
Get a motorcycle taxi and then a train.

546
01:33:20.797 --> 01:33:22.799
A high-speed train?

547
01:33:23.383 --> 01:33:27.095
- Which town in Dongguan is it?
- Humen.


548
01:33:48.450 --> 01:33:50.619
What should I do?

549
01:33:52.204 --> 01:33:55.999
The company rules say:
“No small talk during working hours.”


550
01:33:56.083 --> 01:33:59.711
The accident today was your fault.

551
01:34:01.672 --> 01:34:03.173
Agreed?

552
01:34:07.469 --> 01:34:10.973
The company will pay the medical fees.

553
01:34:11.056 --> 01:34:13.350
You'll pay for the man-hours.

554
01:34:13.892 --> 01:34:17.354
<i>It'll</i> take two weeks
for his hand to heal.

555
01:34:20.065 --> 01:34:22.609
For that period your
wages will go to him.

556
01:34:22.693 --> 01:34:25.028
You'll work for him.

557
01:35:28.634 --> 01:35:34.681
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the next stop will be Dongguan.</i>


558
01:35:48.195 --> 01:35:50.155
Hey, buddy.

559
01:36:29.361 --> 01:36:31.738
He gets my wages while he's off.

560
01:36:31.822 --> 01:36:35.283
So if he's off for 100 days
he gets 100 days' wages from me.


561
01:36:35.367 --> 01:36:39.329
Shit.
That means you work for him.


562
01:36:39.413 --> 01:36:41.707
So I ran away.

563
01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:45.585
Luckily I got paid not long ago
so I'm ahead.


564
01:36:45.794 --> 01:36:49.506
Come and work here.
The factory's recruiting.


565
01:36:49.589 --> 01:36:52.592
Basic pay is 1,200 yuan,
plus meals and a bed.


566
01:36:53.135 --> 01:36:55.303
What do most people get?

567
01:36:55.387 --> 01:36:57.389
About 2,500 yuan.

568
01:36:59.141 --> 01:37:00.976
Training?

569
01:37:01.184 --> 01:37:04.146
One week, without pay.

570
01:37:05.355 --> 01:37:07.774
Anything else going?

571
01:37:11.319 --> 01:37:14.489
You could be a waiter in Changping.

572
01:37:14.781 --> 01:37:16.199
A waiter?

573
01:37:16.283 --> 01:37:19.327
In a nightclub. The johns
are from Hong Kong and Taiwan.


574
01:37:19.411 --> 01:37:22.497
They tip well. 
But you gotta work nights.

575
01:37:23.832 --> 01:37:28.503
- Is it far?
- Nah. it's another town in Dongguan.


576
01:37:33.633 --> 01:37:35.594
Hello, Mr. Lau.

577
01:37:43.852 --> 01:37:47.522
This guy's from my village.
Please take care of him.


578
01:37:47.606 --> 01:37:50.442
- Your buddy?
- Sure, his name's Xiaohui.


579
01:37:50.525 --> 01:37:52.861
Xiaohui, get in.

580
01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:57.282
Call me if anything comes up.

581
01:37:57.365 --> 01:37:59.409
Nothing will.

582
01:37:59.493 --> 01:38:02.329
- Look after him.
- Sure.


583
01:38:08.502 --> 01:38:12.756
When a guest arrives,
don't call him “sir.”


584
01:38:12.839 --> 01:38:17.469
From now on
he's a “distinguished guest.”


585
01:38:17.719 --> 01:38:21.973
So you say, “Good evening,
distinguished guest. Welcome.”


586
01:38:22.057 --> 01:38:23.809
Now, after me.

587
01:38:23.892 --> 01:38:26.144
Good evening, distinguished guest.

588
01:38:26.228 --> 01:38:31.566
Good evening, distinguished guest.
Welcome to The Golden Age.


589
01:38:31.983 --> 01:38:32.984
In Cantonese.

590
01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:40.075
In English.

591
01:38:46.748 --> 01:38:49.084
Show the guest to room 214.

592
01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:06.852
- What are you doing?
- I didn't see anything.


593
01:39:06.935 --> 01:39:08.770
What didn't you see?

594
01:39:08.854 --> 01:39:11.314
I didn't see anything.

595
01:39:12.357 --> 01:39:15.443
It's okay, I'm decent.

596
01:39:16.945 --> 01:39:18.697
New here?

597
01:39:20.782 --> 01:39:24.452
- Name?
- Xiaohui.


598
01:39:25.829 --> 01:39:28.832
- From Hunan?
- How'd you know that?


599
01:39:28.915 --> 01:39:32.168
Easy. I recognize your accent.

600
01:39:32.252 --> 01:39:34.504
I'm from Hunan too.

601
01:39:37.048 --> 01:39:38.800
Come here.

602
01:39:44.723 --> 01:39:46.808
I'm Lianrong.

603
01:39:47.183 --> 01:39:49.644
It means “lotus seed.”

604
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:52.397
Easy to remember.

605
01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:54.232
Delicious.

606
01:39:56.526 --> 01:39:59.321
We were meant to meet here.

607
01:40:00.071 --> 01:40:04.701
Lots of people are “meant to meet here.”

608
01:40:15.170 --> 01:40:17.172
Give me a hand.

609
01:41:36.209 --> 01:41:37.585
Sir.

610
01:41:42.549 --> 01:41:44.759
I'm in Dongguan.

611
01:41:45.885 --> 01:41:48.179
A painting by Xu Beihong?

612
01:41:48.263 --> 01:41:49.931
Buy it.

613
01:41:50.015 --> 01:41:52.434
Great investment.

614
01:41:54.102 --> 01:41:57.647
Okay, see you in Macao.

615
01:41:57.731 --> 01:41:59.691
We're done.

616
01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:33.808
- Slacking?
- No.


617
01:42:39.814 --> 01:42:41.775
Aren't you slacking?

618
01:42:41.858 --> 01:42:44.486
This room has great Wi
-Fi.

619
01:42:47.989 --> 01:42:50.366
Are there many guests?

620
01:42:50.450 --> 01:42:52.619
On and off.

621
01:42:52.702 --> 01:42:56.748
We have a rush around 1:00,
another at 3:00


622
01:42:56.831 --> 01:42:59.375
and another at 5:00.

623
01:43:06.007 --> 01:43:08.885
It's snowing in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia.

624
01:43:08.968 --> 01:43:12.138
It can't be.
Here in Dongguan it's still 75 °F.


625
01:43:16.351 --> 01:43:17.977
Fuck.

626
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:22.273
At the home of a land-bureau chief

627
01:43:22.357 --> 01:43:25.652
they found
more than 130 Louis Vuitton bags.


628
01:43:25.735 --> 01:43:27.987
Why did he buy so many?

629
01:43:28.696 --> 01:43:31.658
- He's a she.
- A lady needs that many?


630
01:43:31.741 --> 01:43:34.119
As I said, she's a lady.

631
01:43:39.165 --> 01:43:41.209
Let's post a comment.

632
01:43:43.086 --> 01:43:47.298
- What to write?
- WTF.


633
01:43:50.552 --> 01:43:52.595
WTF.

634
01:43:52.679 --> 01:43:55.807
The bags were worth over 2 million yuan.

635
01:43:56.975 --> 01:43:59.144
Anything else?

636
01:44:02.355 --> 01:44:05.400
A mine explosion in Shanxi.

637
01:44:05.483 --> 01:44:08.987
- Dozens dead.
- Post a comment.


638
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:12.574
- What?
- WTF.


639
01:44:16.703 --> 01:44:19.247
WTF.

640
01:44:21.082 --> 01:44:22.667
What's your handle?

641
01:44:22.750 --> 01:44:26.212
On QQ, I'm Little Bird.

642
01:44:27.297 --> 01:44:31.718
- Is it really little?
- That's going too far.


643
01:44:31.801 --> 01:44:34.929
Just lending a hand.

644
01:44:35.013 --> 01:44:37.599
You're embarrassed.

645
01:44:38.141 --> 01:44:40.101
What's your handle?

646
01:44:42.729 --> 01:44:44.314
I forgot!

647
01:45:04.375 --> 01:45:05.835
They're not dead?

648
01:45:05.919 --> 01:45:09.964
- You have fish?
- I'm going to set them free tomorrow.


649
01:45:12.467 --> 01:45:14.385
Are you a Buddhist?

650
01:45:15.470 --> 01:45:17.055
Yes.

651
01:45:17.597 --> 01:45:22.685
In this line of work,
the Cantonese call us “illicit traders.”


652
01:45:22.769 --> 01:45:26.981
So we need to do lots of good deeds
to be forgiven in our next life.


653
01:45:27.065 --> 01:45:30.318
Do you understand Little Bird?

654
01:45:34.072 --> 01:45:36.157
My handle is Fish Seeks Water.

655
01:47:06.622 --> 01:47:09.792
Welcome. Room <i>7</i> is here.

656
01:47:23.890 --> 01:47:27.393
<i>Now for the first lesson
in our</i> Quick <i>Cantonese series.</i>


657
01:47:27.477 --> 01:47:32.815
<i>When you meet the right guy
you'll know what to say in Cantonese.</i>


658
01:47:32.899 --> 01:47:35.985
<i>When two people
are first drawn to each other,</i>


659
01:47:36.069 --> 01:47:39.739
<i>if the boy's bold enough,
he'll say, “I like you.”</i>


660
01:47:39.822 --> 01:47:42.700
<i>There are more girls than boys
in Dongguan,</i>


661
01:47:42.784 --> 01:47:47.038
<i>so ifs quite common for a girl
to approach a boy.</i>


662
01:49:34.770 --> 01:49:37.356
I only know one sentence in Cantonese.

663
01:49:39.567 --> 01:49:41.277
Say it.

664
01:49:46.449 --> 01:49:48.451
I like you very much.

665
01:50:11.265 --> 01:50:13.267
Let's leave Dongguan.

666
01:50:18.981 --> 01:50:21.275
Where will you take me?

667
01:50:27.073 --> 01:50:30.701
As long as you're coming,
anywhere will do.


668
01:50:37.959 --> 01:50:40.545
There's no true love in sex work.

669
01:50:40.628 --> 01:50:43.005
How well do you know me?

670
01:50:45.174 --> 01:50:47.426
I have a daughter.

671
01:50:50.304 --> 01:50:52.848
That day you saw me on the train,

672
01:50:52.932 --> 01:50:55.434
I was going to see her in Guangzhou.

673
01:50:57.478 --> 01:50:59.480
She's three.

674
01:51:02.817 --> 01:51:04.986
I have to raise her.

675
01:51:30.011 --> 01:51:31.846
Leaders' Train Room.

676
01:51:39.437 --> 01:51:40.980
Come in.

677
01:51:41.063 --> 01:51:43.566
I want a conductor, not a nurse.

678
01:51:43.649 --> 01:51:46.944
Won't a nurse be good?
There's your health to consider.


679
01:51:47.028 --> 01:51:48.571
That's enough.

680
01:51:48.654 --> 01:51:51.657
Go look after sick comrades.

681
01:51:51.741 --> 01:51:55.119
- But -
- I'm in excellent health.


682
01:51:55.202 --> 01:51:56.662
Leave now.

683
01:51:56.746 --> 01:51:58.831
Please wait, then.

684
01:51:59.999 --> 01:52:02.877
- Your fruit, distinguished guest.
- Leave it there.


685
01:52:29.362 --> 01:52:33.074
Distinguished guest, may I serve you?

686
01:52:33.157 --> 01:52:35.826
Address me as Chief Leader.

687
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:38.162
Chief Leader.

688
01:52:38.245 --> 01:52:41.582
That's better. 
Let's set off.

689
01:52:49.757 --> 01:52:51.509
Where to?

690
01:52:51.592 --> 01:52:54.720
You don't know where we're going?

691
01:52:54.804 --> 01:52:57.348
Wherever you want, we'll go.

692
01:52:57.431 --> 01:53:01.519
Young people nowadays
have no sense of direction.


693
01:53:01.602 --> 01:53:04.814
Any recent innovations?

694
01:53:36.512 --> 01:53:38.264
Come here.

695
01:54:41.076 --> 01:54:43.162
Have fun, buddy.

696
01:54:48.167 --> 01:54:52.630
I have no place to go.
I came here to join you.


697
01:54:54.006 --> 01:54:55.800
Consider it carefully.

698
01:54:55.883 --> 01:55:00.930
Stick with it, no walking out,
or I'd lose face.


699
01:55:01.013 --> 01:55:02.681
I know.

700
01:55:59.071 --> 01:56:03.158
OASIS OF PROSPERITY

701
01:56:53.375 --> 01:56:56.420
- Are you new here?
- I'm a trainee.


702
01:56:56.503 --> 01:56:59.423
Hello. I'm your workshop supervisor.

703
01:56:59.506 --> 01:57:03.385
Welcome to a Fortune 500 company.
Work hard.


704
01:57:03.469 --> 01:57:08.223
Top employees win trips to Taiwan
and visits to our headquarters.


705
01:57:08.307 --> 01:57:09.391
Good luck.

706
01:57:09.475 --> 01:57:11.936
- Where are you from?
- Hunan. And you?


707
01:57:12.019 --> 01:57:13.687
Taiwan.

708
01:58:02.736 --> 01:58:04.613
Hey, Mom.

709
01:58:06.657 --> 01:58:09.743
Didn't I send you money not long ago?

710
01:58:11.829 --> 01:58:14.248
I changed jobs.

711
01:58:14.331 --> 01:58:17.292
We get paid at
the end of the month.

712
01:58:20.421 --> 01:58:23.590
I just checked, I'm broke.

713
01:58:26.719 --> 01:58:31.265
Why would I lie?
I'm at the bank now, I just came out.


714
01:58:35.602 --> 01:58:39.732
I don't waste money.
I can't live on nothing.


715
01:58:39.815 --> 01:58:42.276
I'm not a bank robber.

716
01:58:57.875 --> 01:59:00.627
I really don't waste money.

717
01:59:36.663 --> 01:59:40.334
Thought you could skip work?
Chang Ling wants to see you.


718
02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:47.688
- Hu Yunyun?
- Here.


719
02:02:57.823 --> 02:03:01.451
- Your name is Zheng Xiaoyu?
- Yes.


720
02:03:01.952 --> 02:03:04.037
Your ID card?

721
02:03:14.965 --> 02:03:18.218
- You're from Hubei?
- Right.


722
02:03:19.136 --> 02:03:21.763
Are you familiar with our Shengli Group?

723
02:03:22.472 --> 02:03:25.350
From the Internet, I know a bit.

724
02:03:26.768 --> 02:03:31.023
This is Mrs. Jiao.
She currently chairs our company.


725
02:03:33.275 --> 02:03:36.278
Why have you come
all the way to Shanxi for a job?


726
02:03:38.572 --> 02:03:40.782
Do you have relatives here?

727
02:03:41.241 --> 02:03:42.826
No.

728
02:03:46.496 --> 02:03:49.333
You're a bit older
than the other applicants.


729
02:03:49.958 --> 02:03:52.419
What work experience do you have?

730
02:03:53.754 --> 02:03:57.674
I used to work
in a garment factory in Guangzhou.


731
02:03:57.758 --> 02:03:59.676
Guangzhou?

732
02:04:00.427 --> 02:04:03.180
Why did you leave Guangzhou?

733
02:04:04.431 --> 02:04:06.683
I wanted a new environment.

734
02:04:07.768 --> 02:04:11.271
Your name rings a bell.

735
02:04:12.439 --> 02:04:15.067
Is that problem behind you now?

736
02:04:18.028 --> 02:04:20.030
Yes, it is.

737
02:05:08.286 --> 02:05:15.627
<i>In court,
the magistrate changes his mind</i>


738
02:05:28.723 --> 02:05:30.976
<i>He brands me,
Su San, as a murderer</i>


739
02:05:31.059 --> 02:05:34.688
<i>I cannot defend myself</i>

740
02:05:34.771 --> 02:05:40.610
<i>I am forced to confess</i>

741
02:05:40.694 --> 02:05:43.697
<i>My tears flow</i>

742
02:06:01.381 --> 02:06:05.635
Su San! Do you understand your sin?

743
02:06:07.512 --> 02:06:11.850
Do you understand your sin?

744
02:06:13.810 --> 02:06:19.483
Do you understand your sin?

745
02:09:33.927 --> 02:09:36.262
