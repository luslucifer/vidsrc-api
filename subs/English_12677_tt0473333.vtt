00:05:55.374 --> 00:05:56.475
Hi!

2
00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:33.812
Hi.

3
00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.788
Hello. Two glasses
of wine, please.


4
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:46.892
Paco: Fucking foreigners.

5
00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:49.294
They learn Spanish
just to get drunk.


6
00:06:49.362 --> 00:06:51.997
[laughter]

7
00:06:54.066 --> 00:06:57.369
Paul: It's not nice
laughing at the tourists.


8
00:06:58.237 --> 00:07:00.171
[fly buzzing]

9
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.177
Bartender: The hunter, hunted.
[laughter]


10
00:07:06.245 --> 00:07:07.979
You shut up.
Serve us another round.


11
00:07:08.047 --> 00:07:10.115
After I help
this gentlemen.


12
00:07:10.182 --> 00:07:11.616
Hi.
Good morning.


13
00:07:11.684 --> 00:07:13.151
Hello.

14
00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:14.686
Paco: Is our wine coming
or what?


15
00:07:14.754 --> 00:07:16.354
Waitress: Right away.

16
00:07:19.158 --> 00:07:21.459
Man: British?
Paul: Yes.


17
00:07:21.527 --> 00:07:23.728
Paco: The smart one has spoken.
[laughter]


18
00:07:29.168 --> 00:07:30.569
Man: You speak
very good Spanish.


19
00:07:30.636 --> 00:07:32.871
Paul: My grandma
was from this region.


20
00:07:32.939 --> 00:07:34.105
She married
my grandpa


21
00:07:34.173 --> 00:07:36.575
And they both
moved to England.


22
00:07:36.642 --> 00:07:37.642
I'm practically
from around here.


23
00:07:38.544 --> 00:07:40.579
From around here!
[all laugh]


24
00:07:42.882 --> 00:07:43.882
What was your
grandma's name?


25
00:07:45.451 --> 00:07:48.286
Uh, Begoña.
Begoña Colomo.


26
00:07:49.155 --> 00:07:50.522
I remember her.

27
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.190
And the Englishman.

28
00:07:52.258 --> 00:07:54.025
They lived at the house
by the River.


29
00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:56.061
But it's
abandoned now.


30
00:07:56.128 --> 00:07:59.664
Not anymore. I bought
the house a year ago.


31
00:07:59.732 --> 00:08:00.665
It's mine now.

32
00:09:24.150 --> 00:09:26.518
Man: Your grandpa
loved hunting.


33
00:09:26.585 --> 00:09:28.153
During the time
he spent here...


34
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.922
Hi. Come on.

35
00:09:31.924 --> 00:09:33.958
Who's that?

36
00:09:34.026 --> 00:09:35.260
Who are those?

37
00:09:35.327 --> 00:09:37.328
Englishmen.

38
00:09:37.396 --> 00:09:38.496
Careful, Lechón.

39
00:09:38.564 --> 00:09:40.065
One of them
speaks Spanish.


40
00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:41.132
Right, Antonio?

41
00:09:45.237 --> 00:09:47.105
Leave the bottle.

42
00:09:47.173 --> 00:09:49.641
Man: Two nights ago,
a tree got hit by lightning


43
00:09:49.709 --> 00:09:51.976
And fell in
the middle of the road.


44
00:09:52.044 --> 00:09:54.813
So, to get to
your grandma's house,


45
00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.549
You should now take
the road that starts
at the end of town.


46
00:09:57.616 --> 00:09:59.517
To the left.
Left.


47
00:09:59.585 --> 00:10:00.919
Left, yes.

48
00:10:03.556 --> 00:10:07.992
If all those lazy
men didn't spend
the whole day here,


49
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.527
The road
would be fixed by now.


50
00:10:09.595 --> 00:10:10.662
Fuck me!

51
00:10:14.667 --> 00:10:17.135
[silence]

52
00:10:30.015 --> 00:10:31.449
Come on, I think
we should get going.


53
00:10:31.517 --> 00:10:33.585
It's getting late.
Yeah.


54
00:10:33.652 --> 00:10:34.619
We have to
get going.


55
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:39.958
Paul: Thanks for
the directions.


56
00:10:40.025 --> 00:10:41.126
I'm paying this tab.

57
00:10:41.193 --> 00:10:44.362
Oh, no.
I'll...Pay this time.


58
00:10:45.798 --> 00:10:46.898
Thank you.

59
00:10:50.002 --> 00:10:51.236
Thank you.

60
00:10:59.211 --> 00:11:01.012
Man: That car
won't stand it.


61
00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.113
What?

62
00:11:02.181 --> 00:11:04.382
Man: It won't last
two kilometers.


63
00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:06.551
In your place, I'd take
the other one only.


64
00:11:06.619 --> 00:11:08.586
Paul: Huh. Thank you.

65
00:11:08.654 --> 00:11:10.355
Paul: Goodbye.
Man: Goodbye.


66
00:28:38.102 --> 00:28:39.436
Hello?

67
00:28:41.339 --> 00:28:42.639
Hello.

68
00:30:32.951 --> 00:30:34.217
Take it easy.

69
00:30:35.219 --> 00:30:36.286
Take it easy.

70
00:30:36.354 --> 00:30:39.389
Calm down. We're
not going to hurt you.


71
00:33:10.608 --> 00:33:11.908
Hi.

72
00:33:31.729 --> 00:33:34.931
Calm down, dear.
Nothing is gonna happen to you.


73
00:33:36.033 --> 00:33:38.335
We won't do
anything bad to you.


74
00:33:56.087 --> 00:33:57.320
Take this.

75
00:34:28.986 --> 00:34:30.887
[girl yelping]

76
00:34:32.456 --> 00:34:35.725
Calm down, I'll
take it off afterwards.
Take it easy.


77
00:34:59.183 --> 00:35:00.750
Easy, easy.

78
00:35:00.818 --> 00:35:03.186
That's it,
dear, that's it.


79
00:35:04.755 --> 00:35:06.957
Easy, easy,
that's it, that's it.


80
00:35:07.024 --> 00:35:08.892
That's it.
It's just water.
Just water.


81
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.961
Shh! Shh!

82
00:35:11.028 --> 00:35:12.929
Shh. Shh.

83
00:35:12.997 --> 00:35:15.999
Shh. That's it.

84
00:35:16.067 --> 00:35:17.701
Look, you see?
It's just water.


85
00:35:18.703 --> 00:35:20.570
It's not
a big deal, see?


86
00:35:24.041 --> 00:35:27.811
(music) I have a little doll (music)

87
00:35:27.878 --> 00:35:31.381
(music) dressed up in blue (music)

88
00:36:01.812 --> 00:36:07.450
Isabel: (music) I have a little doll
dressed up in blue (music)


89
00:36:07.518 --> 00:36:13.156
(music) with her little shirt
and her corset (music)


90
00:38:06.504 --> 00:38:07.670
Calm down,
everything is ok.


91
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:02.131
Hi.
Good morning.


92
00:43:02.199 --> 00:43:04.901
Excuse us, we're
the ones from the bar.


93
00:43:04.968 --> 00:43:08.037
[sighs]
yes, I remember.


94
00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.540
What do you want?

95
00:43:12.009 --> 00:43:15.878
Excuse us. I'm Paco, and
these two are my brothers.


96
00:43:15.946 --> 00:43:18.314
Paco: Lechón and Chat,
Antonio.


97
00:43:19.717 --> 00:43:22.018
He's our cousin Miguel.

98
00:43:23.554 --> 00:43:25.354
A little girl from the town
has just disappeared,


99
00:43:25.422 --> 00:43:27.623
And we believe
she got lost in the Forest.


100
00:43:27.691 --> 00:43:28.891
A little girl?

101
00:43:28.959 --> 00:43:31.427
We've been searching for her
since dawn.


102
00:43:31.495 --> 00:43:32.428
Since this is the only
house in the area,


103
00:43:32.496 --> 00:43:33.763
Perhaps
you've seen her.


104
00:43:34.765 --> 00:43:36.265
No, we haven't seen her.

105
00:43:40.237 --> 00:43:42.038
We hoped
you knew something.


106
00:43:42.106 --> 00:43:43.973
I'm sorry.

107
00:43:44.041 --> 00:43:46.743
We haven't seen
anybody around here.


108
00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:48.811
You're the
first ones.


109
00:43:48.879 --> 00:43:51.547
Yeah. This is
a remote area.


110
00:43:51.615 --> 00:43:52.548
Nobody comes here
anymore.


111
00:43:52.616 --> 00:43:53.783
[door squeaks]

112
00:43:58.989 --> 00:44:00.523
And your friends?

113
00:44:00.591 --> 00:44:03.426
Mm. They're sleeping.

114
00:44:03.494 --> 00:44:05.094
It's very early.

115
00:44:12.636 --> 00:44:14.737
We just don't want
the little girl to be hurt.


116
00:44:19.042 --> 00:44:20.576
I'm going with you
to help you search.


117
00:44:24.248 --> 00:44:25.748
Ha ha,
it's ok, uh...


118
00:44:25.816 --> 00:44:27.517
We can take care
of it ourselves.


119
00:44:27.584 --> 00:44:28.518
We didn't mean
to bother.


120
00:44:28.585 --> 00:44:30.686
Not at all.
Really.


121
00:44:30.754 --> 00:44:33.089
Just give me a moment.

122
00:46:47.024 --> 00:46:50.860
You know? My dog
disappeared too.


123
00:46:51.862 --> 00:46:54.397
City dogs become crazy
in the Forest.


124
00:46:54.464 --> 00:46:55.998
They get disoriented.

125
00:46:56.066 --> 00:46:58.868
Don't worry. As soon
as this fog clears up,


126
00:46:58.936 --> 00:47:00.236
He'll come back
for sure.


127
00:47:00.304 --> 00:47:02.605
Sure. He's
very smart.


128
00:47:02.673 --> 00:47:05.975
Same as this one.
Isn't it true,
you damned dog?


129
00:47:06.043 --> 00:47:09.612
You know, you speak
Spanish very well.


130
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.913
Almost better
than these.


131
00:47:10.981 --> 00:47:12.181
[all laugh]

132
00:47:12.249 --> 00:47:13.182
I'm learning.

133
00:47:14.418 --> 00:47:17.586
Yeah, that's what I
tell them to do: Learn.


134
00:47:25.629 --> 00:47:26.762
Well...

135
00:47:27.831 --> 00:47:29.899
It will be better
to spread out.


136
00:47:29.967 --> 00:47:34.303
Miguel, you take
Lechón and Antonio.


137
00:47:34.371 --> 00:47:35.604
I'll go
with this one.


138
00:47:35.672 --> 00:47:37.073
Why he has to
come with us?


139
00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:38.941
Because I say so.

140
00:47:39.743 --> 00:47:41.677
You follow
the River.


141
00:47:41.745 --> 00:47:44.547
Don't worry. You'll
be safe with me.


142
00:47:44.614 --> 00:47:46.916
I don't worry.

143
00:47:46.984 --> 00:47:47.984
What's the girl's name?

144
00:47:52.089 --> 00:47:53.489
Nerea.

145
00:47:53.557 --> 00:47:54.991
Her name is Nerea.

146
00:47:55.058 --> 00:47:56.125
Like her mother.

147
00:47:56.193 --> 00:47:57.927
She's our sister,
you know.


148
00:47:59.496 --> 00:48:01.998
Leave her mother
out of this.


149
00:48:03.633 --> 00:48:06.068
Let's go. We don't
have the whole day.


150
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:02.311
Do you want one?

151
00:51:03.146 --> 00:51:04.780
Thanks.

152
00:51:04.848 --> 00:51:06.849
We don't smoke
anything else here.


153
00:51:17.093 --> 00:51:18.794
Beautiful shotgun.

154
00:51:18.862 --> 00:51:20.996
Do you hunt a lot?

155
00:51:21.064 --> 00:51:22.464
I did when
I was younger.


156
00:51:22.532 --> 00:51:25.367
I started again
recently.


157
00:51:25.435 --> 00:51:26.402
It's like riding
a bike.


158
00:51:26.469 --> 00:51:28.204
You don't forget how.

159
00:51:28.271 --> 00:51:29.772
Are you
a good shooter?


160
00:51:29.839 --> 00:51:32.775
I'm better now
than before.


161
00:51:36.646 --> 00:51:38.480
See that tree branch?

162
00:51:39.449 --> 00:51:40.716
Yeah.

163
00:51:54.164 --> 00:51:55.331
Good.
[chuckles]


164
00:52:14.584 --> 00:52:16.252
[chuckles]

165
00:53:40.804 --> 00:53:42.805
I'm going this way.

166
00:53:42.872 --> 00:53:45.674
Let's meet by that car.

167
00:54:15.638 --> 00:54:17.806
Be careful.

168
00:54:17.874 --> 00:54:18.807
What?

169
00:54:18.875 --> 00:54:20.542
You may get lost.

170
00:54:20.610 --> 00:54:23.612
We can end up
searching for you too.


171
00:54:24.647 --> 00:54:27.683
Just in case,
don't stray too far.


172
00:54:28.618 --> 00:54:30.652
It can be dangerous.

173
00:54:39.162 --> 00:54:40.429
Good morning.

174
00:54:41.064 --> 00:54:42.231
Good morning.

175
00:54:42.298 --> 00:54:43.232
Isabel:
Good morning.


176
00:54:43.299 --> 00:54:45.000
Forgive us for
intruding like this.


177
00:54:45.068 --> 00:54:46.902
We've spent the whole
morning walking
around the Forest,


178
00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:50.873
And we thought
you could offer us
something to drink.


179
00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:53.208
Isabel: Sure, sure.
Take a seat, please.


180
00:54:59.115 --> 00:55:00.983
You're very kind.

181
00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:03.051
Isabel: Take off your coats.
Get comfortable.


182
00:55:03.119 --> 00:55:06.255
Lechón: Thank you.
What do you say?


183
00:55:06.322 --> 00:55:07.322
Thank you.

184
00:55:08.124 --> 00:55:09.558
You're welcome.

185
00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:15.597
A big Storm is coming.

186
00:55:15.665 --> 00:55:17.032
Even the birds are
staying in their nests.


187
00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:19.168
[chuckles]

188
00:55:19.235 --> 00:55:22.271
Would you like
some hot coffee?
I just made it.


189
00:55:24.774 --> 00:55:27.075
Well, yes,
thank you.


190
00:55:27.143 --> 00:55:28.377
Thank you.

191
00:55:45.228 --> 00:55:46.695
Cream? Sugar?

192
00:55:48.364 --> 00:55:49.298
No, thanks.

193
00:55:51.935 --> 00:55:53.368
We like it strong.

194
00:55:53.436 --> 00:55:55.270
No sugar.

195
00:56:00.343 --> 00:56:02.277
Yes, good.

196
00:56:02.345 --> 00:56:04.980
Where there's
a woman's hand...


197
00:56:17.327 --> 00:56:18.494
And where's
the other one?


198
00:56:19.863 --> 00:56:21.530
The other one?

199
00:56:21.598 --> 00:56:22.798
Yes, the other one.

200
00:56:22.866 --> 00:56:25.200
The one with
the retarded face.


201
00:56:25.268 --> 00:56:27.269
Isabel: He's coming back soon.

202
00:56:27.337 --> 00:56:28.537
Right.

203
00:56:32.642 --> 00:56:33.742
He's getting rotten.

204
00:56:35.144 --> 00:56:36.445
What?

205
00:56:36.513 --> 00:56:39.381
The rabbit.
He's getting rotten.


206
00:56:39.449 --> 00:56:41.149
Can't you smell it?
[inhales deeply]


207
00:56:41.217 --> 00:56:42.751
Tell them to leave.

208
00:56:45.054 --> 00:56:47.623
What does she say?
Isabel: Nothing.


209
00:56:47.690 --> 00:56:48.891
Nothing?

210
00:56:48.958 --> 00:56:50.792
Isabel: Please,
leave us alone.


211
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:52.160
We got many
things to do.


212
00:56:52.228 --> 00:56:53.962
Why don't we dance?

213
00:56:54.030 --> 00:56:56.632
It's been a while
since I danced
with a beautiful woman.


214
00:56:56.699 --> 00:56:58.967
In the town, only
the ugly ones dance with me.


215
00:56:59.035 --> 00:57:02.838
Antonio.
Look for a romantic song.


216
00:57:10.446 --> 00:57:12.414
The radio doesn't work.

217
00:57:18.555 --> 00:57:20.055
(music) I said,
"father, change my name" (music)


218
00:57:20.123 --> 00:57:21.823
That one.
Leave that one on.


219
00:57:23.526 --> 00:57:25.227
Get out, please.

220
00:57:25.295 --> 00:57:28.564
Just one dance. One dance
and we leave, I promise.


221
00:57:31.234 --> 00:57:33.402
Tell her to be
nice with me,
it's only a dance.


222
00:57:33.469 --> 00:57:35.671
(music) lover, lover,
lover, lover (music)


223
00:57:35.738 --> 00:57:38.173
(music) lover, lover,
lover, come back to me (music)


224
00:57:38.241 --> 00:57:40.976
That's it.
Like this.


225
00:57:41.044 --> 00:57:42.144
That's it.

226
00:57:42.211 --> 00:57:44.379
(music) lover, lover,
lover, lover (music)


227
00:57:44.447 --> 00:57:49.017
(music) lover, lover,
lover, come back to me (music)


228
00:57:51.054 --> 00:57:53.121
Put the volume up!

229
00:57:53.189 --> 00:57:56.758
(music) I mean it as
a kind of trial (music)


230
00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.602
What are you waiting for?
Dance with the other one.


231
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:17.172
Lechón: Go.
I don't feel like it.


232
00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:20.575
Don't be rude.
She feels like it.


233
00:59:20.643 --> 00:59:22.344
Lechón: Isn't that right?

234
00:59:22.412 --> 00:59:24.446
Don't you think
he's quite handsome?


235
00:59:24.514 --> 00:59:26.248
Women fight for him
in our town.


236
00:59:26.315 --> 00:59:28.583
And the idiot doesn't do
anything about it.


237
00:59:28.651 --> 00:59:30.585
I think he's gay.

238
00:59:36.125 --> 00:59:39.327
(music) yes, and lover, lover, lover,
lover, lover, lover (music)


239
00:59:39.395 --> 00:59:41.830
Lechón: And you don't play
the fool. What do you think?


240
00:59:41.898 --> 00:59:44.633
That I didn't notice
how you stared at me at the bar?


241
00:59:44.701 --> 00:59:46.935
Huh?
Please let go of me.


242
00:59:47.003 --> 00:59:50.405
"plisletgofmi"?
I like your voice.


243
00:59:50.473 --> 00:59:52.007
And I like your mouth
even more.


244
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:54.309
Easy, woman.

245
00:59:54.377 --> 00:59:55.544
The little girl
is upstairs.


246
00:59:55.611 --> 00:59:57.612
Don't hurt us, please.

247
00:59:57.680 --> 01:00:00.582
Wow, finally
the bird sang.


248
01:00:01.818 --> 01:00:04.152
You heard her, Antonio.
Go get the kid.


249
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.088
<i>Laisse-moi.</i>

250
01:00:06.155 --> 01:00:08.890
We shouldn't.
Go upstairs, damn it!


251
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:16.131
And you, if you
don't want your friend
to lose her teeth,


252
01:00:16.199 --> 01:00:19.935
Stay where you are
and shut up. Ok?


253
01:00:20.002 --> 01:00:21.169
You already got
what you want.


254
01:00:21.237 --> 01:00:22.704
Please, get out.
I won't say anything.


255
01:00:22.772 --> 01:00:25.107
Lechón: Enough. It's over.

256
01:00:25.174 --> 01:00:27.442
You stay still.
I'll be the one
moving you, ok?


257
01:00:28.878 --> 01:00:29.978
[glass breaks]

258
01:00:48.464 --> 01:00:49.931
Go out
and keep watch.


259
01:00:49.999 --> 01:00:51.533
We already
have the kid.


260
01:00:51.601 --> 01:00:53.268
Out, I said!

261
01:00:53.336 --> 01:00:56.037
Or you want me
to crush your head?


262
01:01:04.847 --> 01:01:07.115
Tell her I'm gonna
take the knife away,


263
01:01:07.183 --> 01:01:09.618
But she better
not try anything.


264
01:01:09.685 --> 01:01:10.919
Come on, tell her.

265
01:01:10.987 --> 01:01:12.354
[girl screaming]

266
01:01:12.421 --> 01:01:15.023
Isabel: He's going to
take the knife away.


267
01:01:15.091 --> 01:01:18.360
Please let him finish,
and they'll go away.


268
01:01:19.796 --> 01:01:22.631
Good. I see
you understood.


269
01:02:22.124 --> 01:02:24.159
Easy, easy.
Calm down.


270
01:02:26.395 --> 01:02:28.697
What about the police?

271
01:02:28.764 --> 01:02:30.031
We better
go tell them.


272
01:02:30.099 --> 01:02:32.767
The civil guard?
They don't care.


273
01:02:32.835 --> 01:02:34.569
Our problems
make them laugh.


274
01:02:34.637 --> 01:02:36.238
Here everybody minds
their own business.


275
01:02:36.305 --> 01:02:37.839
But her mother
will be worried.


276
01:02:39.041 --> 01:02:40.909
Leave her mother out.

277
01:02:40.977 --> 01:02:42.210
Our sister
is a good woman.


278
01:02:42.278 --> 01:02:43.245
It's not her fault.

279
01:02:43.312 --> 01:02:45.146
I didn't mean to offend.

280
01:02:47.116 --> 01:02:49.017
[thunder]

281
01:02:50.319 --> 01:02:51.486
I must go back.

282
01:02:52.321 --> 01:02:53.588
Go back?

283
01:02:53.656 --> 01:02:56.258
I must go back
to my friends.


284
01:02:58.327 --> 01:03:01.363
You better go
to the police.


285
01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:03.665
This is serious.

286
01:03:05.301 --> 01:03:07.269
Yeah, yeah.

287
01:03:07.336 --> 01:03:09.337
It's not
a laughing matter.


288
01:03:12.008 --> 01:03:14.442
This place is
very peaceful.


289
01:03:16.345 --> 01:03:18.847
Only humble, hard-working
people live here.


290
01:03:25.321 --> 01:03:28.623
Perhaps we're not
as learned as you are.


291
01:03:28.691 --> 01:03:31.593
But we're decent people
and we don't like trouble.


292
01:03:31.661 --> 01:03:33.328
And if you don't like
one problem,


293
01:03:33.396 --> 01:03:35.330
You lock her away
like an animal.


294
01:03:35.398 --> 01:03:36.331
You wouldn't
understand.


295
01:03:36.399 --> 01:03:37.832
Some things are better
kept secret.


296
01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:39.200
If you offend God,
you have to pay.


297
01:03:39.268 --> 01:03:41.803
And the girl?
Who did she offend?


298
01:03:43.706 --> 01:03:46.441
Sometimes the righteous
pay for the sinners.


299
01:03:56.686 --> 01:03:58.186
Look...

300
01:04:00.156 --> 01:04:02.057
She's a good girl.

301
01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.361
I wouldn't want her
to be hurt.


302
01:04:13.469 --> 01:04:15.670
Why did you
leave the house deserted?


303
01:04:15.738 --> 01:04:18.640
The house is not
deserted.


304
01:04:18.708 --> 01:04:20.442
I know it's not.

305
01:04:21.677 --> 01:04:22.711
[twig snaps]

306
01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.814
Ooh!

What the fuck
did you do, idiot?


308
01:04:30.319 --> 01:04:33.221
If he doesn't
understand the words,
what the hell?


309
01:04:33.289 --> 01:04:36.224
Besides, I was
getting bored. Fuck it.


310
01:07:20.656 --> 01:07:22.157
I didn't hit him
that hard.


311
01:07:22.224 --> 01:07:25.627
Shut up. You almost
broke his skull.


312
01:07:25.694 --> 01:07:27.695
Give me
the canteen.


313
01:07:34.203 --> 01:07:37.105
Wake up!
Do you hear me?


314
01:07:38.007 --> 01:07:38.940
Hey, hey!

315
01:07:41.977 --> 01:07:44.078
[coughing]

316
01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.415
We're gonna
leave you here.


317
01:07:47.483 --> 01:07:48.883
We're going
to pick up the girl,


318
01:07:48.951 --> 01:07:50.552
And then
we'll be back.


319
01:07:51.387 --> 01:07:53.288
Do you
understand me?


320
01:07:53.355 --> 01:07:55.123
After things cool down,

321
01:07:55.191 --> 01:07:57.292
You and me
will have a talk.


322
01:07:59.428 --> 01:08:02.764
Come on.
Carry him.


323
01:08:06.869 --> 01:08:09.470
Miguel: Let's see if his
dizziness goes away now.


324
01:08:09.538 --> 01:08:11.639
We're gonna
leave you here. Locked.

[vomits]
it's for your own good.


326
01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:16.644
You couldn't find
your way out of the Forest.


327
01:08:16.712 --> 01:08:17.812
We'll be back
in a couple of hours.


328
01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:19.214
You have time
to think it over--


329
01:08:19.281 --> 01:08:20.582
What's best for you.

330
01:08:20.649 --> 01:08:23.384
I can walk,
I'm ok.


331
01:08:23.452 --> 01:08:25.453
Let him walk in
by himself.


332
01:08:25.521 --> 01:08:26.621
Oh!

Don't fucking kill him.

01:08:33.929 --> 01:08:34.862
Fuck.

There he is!

[gunshot]
aah!


340
01:09:14.436 --> 01:09:16.938
Fuck, I told you
not to shoot at him.


341
01:09:17.006 --> 01:09:18.873
If we don't get him,
we're fucked.


342
01:09:18.941 --> 01:09:19.874
Give me that.
Let's go.


343
01:10:55.037 --> 01:10:57.138
Attack, attack.
He's here!


344
01:11:47.055 --> 01:11:49.023
Son of a bitch.

345
01:11:57.299 --> 01:11:58.833
Aah!

[shouts]

347
01:13:50.212 --> 01:13:51.946
Don't move...

348
01:13:52.014 --> 01:13:54.949
Or I'll blow
your fuckin' head off.


349
01:13:56.518 --> 01:13:57.952
Where are the others?

350
01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.454
Where are they?

351
01:14:06.161 --> 01:14:07.361
Are you ok?

352
01:14:10.198 --> 01:14:11.399
What about Lechón?

353
01:14:13.802 --> 01:14:14.735
Dead.

354
01:14:24.713 --> 01:14:26.180
Dead?

355
01:14:28.016 --> 01:14:30.217
Antonio: In the house.

356
01:14:39.995 --> 01:14:41.262
Miguel?

357
01:18:07.369 --> 01:18:10.137
Hello. Sorry
to bother you.


358
01:18:10.205 --> 01:18:11.672
We had a problem
with our car.


359
01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.374
We ran out of gas.

360
01:18:13.441 --> 01:18:14.642
Can we use
your phone?


361
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:16.110
I'm sorry,
we don't have one.


362
01:18:16.178 --> 01:18:18.679
There are no phones
in this town.


363
01:18:18.747 --> 01:18:20.281
But if I can be
of any help...


364
01:18:30.091 --> 01:18:32.660
You better come in.
You're soaked.


365
01:18:47.309 --> 01:18:48.576
Don't you want
to come in?


366
01:18:48.643 --> 01:18:50.211
You're going to catch
pneumonia.


367
01:18:55.217 --> 01:18:56.784
Thank you.

368
01:19:07.629 --> 01:19:09.496
Poor kid,
she must be so cold.


369
01:19:09.564 --> 01:19:11.165
Yes, she's exhausted.
She fell asleep.


370
01:19:11.233 --> 01:19:13.300
[in Spanish]
girl ok, thanks.


371
01:19:17.405 --> 01:19:18.672
Come in.

Man: What's going on?

374
01:19:30.185 --> 01:19:32.353
English people, dad.
They ran out of gas.


375
01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:35.389
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.


376
01:19:36.558 --> 01:19:38.559
This is a bad place
to run out of gas.


377
01:19:38.627 --> 01:19:40.728
More so in this weather.

378
01:19:40.795 --> 01:19:41.729
Yes.

379
01:19:44.399 --> 01:19:48.302
Go on. Go to the kitchen
and fix them something to eat.


380
01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:50.104
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.


381
01:19:52.674 --> 01:19:56.577
Can you please tell him
to leave the shotgun somewhere?


382
01:19:56.645 --> 01:19:58.145
The devil loads them.

383
01:20:14.162 --> 01:20:15.162
Thanks.

384
01:20:17.299 --> 01:20:21.969
My daughter will
fix you something
to help you get warm.


385
01:20:22.037 --> 01:20:24.338
Isabel: Thanks.
You're very kind.
Man: Don't mention it.


386
01:20:24.406 --> 01:20:28.108
Upstairs I have towels,
some clothes,
if you want to change.


387
01:20:28.176 --> 01:20:29.510
While your clothes
get dry.


388
01:20:29.577 --> 01:20:30.945
Isabel: Very well.

389
01:20:31.012 --> 01:20:34.114
Man: Or I can lend you
some gas and drive you
back to your car.


390
01:20:34.182 --> 01:20:37.918
But with the roads
full of mud, that
won't be advisable.


391
01:20:37.986 --> 01:20:39.153
Isabel: Perhaps he could
take us to the--


392
01:21:04.179 --> 01:21:05.245
Should we go up?

393
01:21:05.313 --> 01:21:08.048
There are two empty rooms
where you can change.


394
01:21:08.116 --> 01:21:10.017
Yes, yes.
This way.


395
01:21:10.085 --> 01:21:11.418
Come on, let's go.

what's going on?

I don't
understand you.


398
01:25:28.943 --> 01:25:32.179
Man: Are you ok? Go check
what's going on upstairs.

01:25:43.791 --> 01:25:45.292
Please...

Where's Paul?

401
01:25:48.129 --> 01:25:49.363
Calm down.

01:26:15.023 --> 01:26:16.790
Son of a bitch.

403
01:27:16.384 --> 01:27:17.751
I got you, asshole.

404
01:27:57.925 --> 01:27:59.459
Give me the girl.

405
01:28:03.197 --> 01:28:05.298
I beg you, one last time,
give me back the girl.


406
01:28:05.366 --> 01:28:06.867
She's mine.

407
01:28:07.935 --> 01:28:09.669
Don't you see
she's crying?


408

Don't make me kill you!

with me to see the civil guard.

01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:44.584
Let's go.
Get into the car.

Man: Get into the car.

01:32:01.068 --> 01:32:02.469
Did you understand?

01:32:08.209 --> 01:32:09.909
You understood, right?
