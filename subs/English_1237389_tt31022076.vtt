Because I know that was your favorite grandmother.

You know, she was my favorite grandma,

102
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.840
but that was also
because your mother hated me.

me to move in with her family,

we gotta fix it up a little bit,

Pause the game for a minute. 
I need to talk to you.

00:08:46.095 --> 00:08:47.797
My friends call me BK.

166
00:08:47.864 --> 00:08:48.998
It's nice to meet you, BK.

167
00:08:49.065 --> 00:08:50.366
BK.

168
00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:52.268
Um, and this is my friend, Dante, so...

169
00:08:53.236 --> 00:08:54.237
[Dante] How you doing?

170
00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:55.638
I'm Dante.

171
00:08:55.671 --> 00:08:57.440
-He comes with the house. 
-[Joanna] Hey.

172
00:08:57.507 --> 00:08:59.442
[Whitney] Uh-hmm. 
We find you in the pantry.

173
00:08:59.475 --> 00:09:00.610
[Dante] And you guys love me for it.

174
00:09:00.643 --> 00:09:03.379
Your house is so beautiful.

175
00:09:04.647 --> 00:09:07.016
When my dad first told
me that you were dating,

176
00:09:07.049 --> 00:09:08.351
I looked you up

177
00:09:08.384 --> 00:09:09.385
and I ordered some of your products

178
00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:10.820
and they were really good.

179
00:09:10.887 --> 00:09:12.321
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

180
00:09:12.355 --> 00:09:15.625
I could've given you them for free.

181
00:09:17.059 --> 00:09:18.594
This is a really nice photo.

182
00:09:20.062 --> 00:09:21.330
Oh, what's this?

183
00:09:21.397 --> 00:09:25.768
Oh, um, that's my mother's urn.

184
00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:28.804
She passed away a
little over a year ago,

185
00:09:28.838 --> 00:09:31.474
and we we're really close, so
I like to keep her here

186
00:09:31.541 --> 00:09:35.244
with me, and no one touches it.

187
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:36.879
[Joanna] Well, that's really sweet.

188
00:09:36.913 --> 00:09:40.383
I really wish I
would've done something like that.

189
00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:43.286
Um, I'm sorry.

190
00:09:43.319 --> 00:09:45.655
I didn't mean to upset you.

191
00:09:45.688 --> 00:09:47.356
It's okay.

192
00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.991
It's just been a lot.

193
00:09:49.058 --> 00:09:51.093
[Michael] No, it's fine.

194
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.595
It's okay, right?

195
00:09:54.964 --> 00:09:58.034
[suspenseful music]

196
00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:13.249
Hey, baby,

197
00:10:13.316 --> 00:10:15.818
I got Joanna all
settled in down there, so...

198
00:10:15.885 --> 00:10:19.388
-Hmm. 
-Yeah, she's good.

199
00:10:19.422 --> 00:10:20.489
That's great.

200
00:10:21.891 --> 00:10:23.826
[Michael] Is it?

201
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.494
Yes, it is.

202
00:10:25.528 --> 00:10:27.163
It's...that's great news.

203
00:10:27.229 --> 00:10:29.398
I'm just...like I said, 
I just wanna apologize

204
00:10:29.465 --> 00:10:31.534
because we never really talked and discussed it--

205
00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:32.835
-Honey... -...and she just popped up.

206
00:10:32.902 --> 00:10:34.103
-It wasn't planned... 
-I know.

207
00:10:34.136 --> 00:10:35.304
-...you know? 
-Yes, it was...

208
00:10:35.338 --> 00:10:38.641
it is an unexpected surprise,

209
00:10:38.708 --> 00:10:42.078
but she's your daughter
and we're a family now,

210
00:10:42.144 --> 00:10:45.581
so we just gotta
roll with the punches, right?

211
00:10:45.648 --> 00:10:48.184
Yeah. Yeah.

212
00:10:48.217 --> 00:10:49.585
Okay.

213
00:10:49.619 --> 00:10:51.387
[Whitney] You ready for beds?

214
00:10:51.454 --> 00:10:53.289
I'm ready now.

215
00:10:53.356 --> 00:10:54.724
[Whitney] Let's go.

216
00:10:54.757 --> 00:10:56.626
[indistinct] I got permission, you know.

[knocks on door]

219
00:11:11.707 --> 00:11:13.476
[Brian] Hey, can I come in?

220
00:11:13.509 --> 00:11:14.744
[Joanna] Yeah, come on in.

221
00:11:17.947 --> 00:11:19.849
Oh, shoot.

222
00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.585
I didn't-
-I didn't know you could paint.

223
00:11:22.652 --> 00:11:24.120
Oh, yeah, I do it for fun.

224
00:11:27.456 --> 00:11:29.492
Um, I just wanted to tell you

225
00:11:29.558 --> 00:11:32.028
that they're about to make lunch.

226
00:11:32.061 --> 00:11:34.130
It's gonna be turkey sandwiches, so...

227
00:11:35.564 --> 00:11:37.199
Okay. Thanks.

228
00:11:42.538 --> 00:11:45.608
[dramatic music]

229
00:11:47.109 --> 00:11:49.679
[Brian] Is that supposed to be you?

230
00:11:49.712 --> 00:11:52.481
Oh, yeah, this is me.

231
00:11:52.515 --> 00:11:56.052
Um, the painting basically just represents

232
00:11:56.085 --> 00:11:59.488
the two women I love
the most in my life dying.

233
00:11:59.522 --> 00:12:02.158
Well, you are--you are talented.

234
00:12:02.224 --> 00:12:04.226
[Joanna] Appreciate it.

235
00:12:04.293 --> 00:12:06.128
Apparently, I get it from my mother.

236
00:12:09.665 --> 00:12:10.733
[Brian] Is this her?

237
00:12:11.867 --> 00:12:13.969
Uh, yeah, that's her.

238
00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:20.209
Wow. I mean, she's gorgeous.

239
00:12:20.276 --> 00:12:22.044
You look just like her, you know?

240
00:12:22.078 --> 00:12:25.815
Do you, uh, you miss her a lot?

241
00:12:25.848 --> 00:12:27.950
Yeah, I do.

242
00:12:28.017 --> 00:12:32.154
I just get lost in
thought a lot of the time

243
00:12:32.188 --> 00:12:35.091
thinking about how she feels about certain things.

244
00:12:37.159 --> 00:12:38.527
Like what?

245
00:12:39.862 --> 00:12:43.866
Like if she's angry at
the drunk driver that killed her.

246
00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:45.334
I couldn't...

247
00:12:47.603 --> 00:12:49.972
I couldn't even imagine something like that

248
00:12:50.039 --> 00:12:53.175
happening to my mom, you know?

249

[hip-hop music]

[Michael] Left, right, left, right.

251

If you gonna cut it, cut it right.

You just in time for the party, baby.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.425
Just in time. Lunch is almost ready.

can Dante spend the night tonight?

I don't see why not.

00:13:16.966 --> 00:13:18.367
You okay with that, babe?

260
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.802
You know, I don't make the rules.

261

It's your mama house.

-You right. 
-[Michael] And you know that.

00:13:22.972 --> 00:13:25.274
Okay. Yeah.

264
00:13:25.341 --> 00:13:27.309
All I do is make sandwiches.

00:13:28.444 --> 00:13:30.045
Let's see what this tastes like.

266

Hey, Whitney,

267
00:13:32.815 --> 00:13:35.184
what is all this stuff for?

268
00:13:35.217 --> 00:13:37.486
Oh, these are samples that I'm prepping

00:13:37.553 --> 00:13:39.989
for my pitch meeting I have coming up.

270
00:13:40.022 --> 00:13:41.590
What's a pitch meeting?

271
00:13:41.657 --> 00:13:44.293
I have a meeting
with some execs from Walmart,

272
00:13:44.326 --> 00:13:46.061
so if all goes well,

273
00:13:46.128 --> 00:13:48.430
they'll start to carry
my products in their stores,

274
00:13:48.464 --> 00:13:50.800
and that means worldwide distribution.

275
00:13:50.833 --> 00:13:54.036
That would be huge for us.

276
00:13:55.137 --> 00:13:57.173
Wow.

277
00:13:57.206 --> 00:13:59.308
This is all so cool.

to a lot of girls like me.

00:14:02.845 --> 00:14:05.848
I really do hope that one
day I can be somewhat like you.

Aw, you're so sweet and beautiful.

282
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.155
And your dad tells me
how creative and smart you are.

283
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:14.790
[Michael] Uh-hmm.

284
00:14:14.857 --> 00:14:17.726
Because I'm always bragging about my baby.

285
00:14:20.062 --> 00:14:21.430
Leave her alone.

I'm sure you'll be able
to accomplish whatever you want.

I hope you're hungry.

-Yeah, I'm starving. 
-Yeah?

291

Put this away.

292
00:14:38.113 --> 00:14:39.849
You know, I was thinking

293
00:14:39.882 --> 00:14:42.985
maybe we could have
a girls' day this weekend

294
00:14:43.052 --> 00:14:45.654
and go get our nails done

295
00:14:45.688 --> 00:14:47.556
or a facial or something like that.

296
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.991
What do you--what do you say?

297
00:14:49.058 --> 00:14:50.192
Yeah, that sounds great.

298
00:14:50.259 --> 00:14:52.595
Um, let me think about it.

299
00:14:53.762 --> 00:14:54.463
Okay.

Oh, sh--

306
00:15:12.915 --> 00:15:13.649
[Whitney] What happened, baby?

00:15:15.384 --> 00:15:16.585
-[Michael] Hey, hey, hey! 
-[Whitney] Oh, my God.

What are y'all doing?

No, no, no, don't touch-- don't touch anything.

313
00:15:29.164 --> 00:15:30.833
-Can I help? 
-No, no, no. I got it.

314
00:15:30.866 --> 00:15:31.967
It's okay.

315
00:15:33.202 --> 00:15:34.503
[Michael] What do you--
what do you want, baby?

316
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:35.704
Do you want a container or something?

317
00:15:35.738 --> 00:15:37.006
I...can I do that? Yes.

318
00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:38.040
Can you get me a container, please?

319
00:15:38.073 --> 00:15:39.942
[groans] I can't believe this.

320
00:15:39.975 --> 00:15:41.543
Baby, what?

321
00:15:42.945 --> 00:15:44.013
[sighs]

322
00:15:49.652 --> 00:15:51.720
Accidents happen, but the fact that she acted

323
00:15:51.787 --> 00:15:53.522
like she didn't even do it,

324
00:15:53.555 --> 00:15:54.890
it's a little troubling.

325
00:15:56.592 --> 00:15:59.428
I mean, she was
probably scared to say something.

326
00:15:59.461 --> 00:16:01.030
Think about it.

327
00:16:01.096 --> 00:16:02.631
If it was you,

328
00:16:02.665 --> 00:16:04.600
don't you think you would
be a little afraid too?

329
00:16:05.167 --> 00:16:07.903
Put yourself in her shoes? 
I'm saying she just got here.

330
00:16:07.937 --> 00:16:09.705
I guess you're right.

331
00:16:11.974 --> 00:16:14.109
I mean, at least we were
able to get most of the ashes.

332
00:16:14.143 --> 00:16:15.511
I can always get a new urn.

333
00:16:15.577 --> 00:16:16.912
Right.

334
00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:18.714
Please do not tell
Joanna that Eric told me.

335
00:16:18.747 --> 00:16:21.717
He does not want
her not to like him.

336
00:16:21.784 --> 00:16:23.585
[chuckles] I'm not gonna tell.

337
00:16:23.652 --> 00:16:24.620
Trust me.

338
00:16:24.653 --> 00:16:27.523
Oh, he's so cute.

339
00:16:28.657 --> 00:16:30.259
I do wanna say thank you, you know,

340
00:16:30.292 --> 00:16:31.694
just for being understanding

341
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.430
about Joanna popping up like this.

342
00:16:34.496 --> 00:16:36.532
She's a good kid, baby, trust me.

343
00:16:36.598 --> 00:16:37.967
Yeah,

344
00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.769
she seems like it,

345
00:16:40.803 --> 00:16:42.871
which is what makes me wonder

346
00:16:42.938 --> 00:16:46.508
why you didn't take
her after her mother died.

347
00:16:47.676 --> 00:16:52.014
I mean, there's a reason why.

348
00:16:52.081 --> 00:16:53.849
I mean, we just...

349
00:16:55.584 --> 00:16:58.454
we never talked about it.

350
00:16:58.487 --> 00:16:59.555
I'm listening.

351
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:02.925
Oh, wow.

352
00:17:02.958 --> 00:17:08.864
Um... this is funny. 
I haven't, um...

353
00:17:11.066 --> 00:17:15.337
I hadn't talked about
this to anyone in years.

354
00:17:17.773 --> 00:17:21.210
Baby, you can-- you can tell me anything.

355
00:17:21.243 --> 00:17:22.311
I'm here.

356
00:17:24.246 --> 00:17:27.816
I mean, I told
you that she was killed,

357
00:17:27.883 --> 00:17:30.152
um, by a drunk driver, but I didn't...

358
00:17:30.185 --> 00:17:32.888
never go into detail about what happened afterwards.

359
00:17:34.423 --> 00:17:35.991
It was about five years ago.

360
00:17:36.025 --> 00:17:39.094
Um, and then after the accident,

361
00:17:39.128 --> 00:17:41.063
it was...

362
00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.799
you know, it was just bad for me.

363
00:17:43.866 --> 00:17:46.135
It was rough on Joanna too.

364
00:17:48.904 --> 00:17:49.905
And, you know, 
I started drinking

365
00:17:49.938 --> 00:17:51.874
to deal with the pain

366
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:56.145
and... drinking heavy,

367
00:17:56.211 --> 00:17:58.847
so heavy that I would--um,

368
00:17:58.881 --> 00:18:00.883
I would pass out,

369
00:18:00.916 --> 00:18:05.421
black out at hotels for days

370
00:18:05.454 --> 00:18:08.724
and I would leave Joanna.

371
00:18:08.791 --> 00:18:11.493
She would be at home by herself.

372
00:18:14.563 --> 00:18:17.466
Can you imagine that little girl,

373
00:18:17.533 --> 00:18:20.602
12 years old, all alone?

374
00:18:23.439 --> 00:18:25.507
No money, no food.

375
00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:27.076
Just...

376
00:18:30.946 --> 00:18:32.915
she's so smart.

377
00:18:32.948 --> 00:18:35.851
Jo is so smart. 
That girl is a survivor, man.

378
00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:38.587
She was walking to the store, you know,

379
00:18:38.821 --> 00:18:40.055
to get something to eat.

380
00:18:40.089 --> 00:18:44.326
And I was at home, blacked out

381
00:18:44.359 --> 00:18:46.295
on one of my episodes,

382
00:18:49.465 --> 00:18:51.333
and she got picked up by the cops.

383
00:18:51.366 --> 00:18:54.603
And long story short,

384
00:18:54.636 --> 00:18:58.907
that's how she ended up with Chantal's mother.

385
00:19:01.143 --> 00:19:03.078
Oh, my God

386
00:19:03.112 --> 00:19:04.213
Yeah.

387
00:19:06.348 --> 00:19:08.417
That little girl, man, she loved me.

388
00:19:08.484 --> 00:19:11.453
She loved me so much,
she wasn't gonna tell on me,

389
00:19:11.487 --> 00:19:16.458
but they took her and
it was for the best,

390
00:19:16.492 --> 00:19:17.893
because I wasn't, um...

391
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.499
I wasn't good for her and, you know,

392
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.835
I was-
- I wasn't good for anyone,

393
00:19:26.902 --> 00:19:29.471
you know, at that time, so...

394
00:19:33.342 --> 00:19:34.476
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.746
That sounds really tough.

396
00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:41.817
I'm sorry you two both
had to deal with that.

397
00:19:41.884 --> 00:19:42.985
I am...

398
00:19:44.253 --> 00:19:46.955
I just kind of thought like
this would be my second chance,

399
00:19:47.022 --> 00:19:48.257
you know,

400
00:19:49.725 --> 00:19:51.393
so I could finally give that little girl

401
00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.762
the father that she deserves.

402
00:19:53.795 --> 00:19:56.331
Uh-hmm.

403
00:19:56.365 --> 00:19:57.733
You will.

404
00:19:57.799 --> 00:19:59.568
You are.

405
00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:03.739
You're an amazing person and you
are so good to the boys.

406
00:20:05.073 --> 00:20:06.308
Yeah?

407
00:20:06.341 --> 00:20:07.643
She'll see that.

408
00:20:08.744 --> 00:20:10.078
It's coming around.

409
00:20:13.615 --> 00:20:15.217
-Thank you. 
-Uh-hmm.

410
00:20:16.151 --> 00:20:18.820
-I love you. 
-I love you too.

411
00:20:21.056 --> 00:20:23.392
[Cassandra] Wait, he is just
now telling you about this?

412
00:20:23.458 --> 00:20:26.028
[Rhonda] Whoa, whoa, well, maybe he was ashamed.

413
00:20:26.061 --> 00:20:28.330
But we're talking about his wife and daughter.

414
00:20:28.397 --> 00:20:31.066
He should have come clean
before he popped the question.

415
00:20:31.967 --> 00:20:35.337
I do not fault
him for not telling me.

416
00:20:35.404 --> 00:20:37.172
[Rhonda] Are you insane?

417
00:20:37.239 --> 00:20:39.675
After everything you've been
through in your first marriage?

418
00:20:39.741 --> 00:20:41.743
I'm just saying I'd be extra cautious.

419
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:44.079
Michael is nothing like James.

420
00:20:45.247 --> 00:20:47.816
I'm really worried about Joanna.

421
00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:50.219
You know how it
was when we lost mom?

422
00:20:50.252 --> 00:20:51.620
[Cassandra] Uh-hmm.

423
00:20:51.653 --> 00:20:53.222
I would be worried too.

424
00:20:53.288 --> 00:20:55.090
There's no telling how an incident like that

425
00:20:55.123 --> 00:20:57.359
has shaped her mentally.

426
00:20:57.426 --> 00:20:58.860
And she did break your mom's urn.

427
00:20:58.894 --> 00:21:00.295
It was a honest mistake.

428
00:21:00.362 --> 00:21:01.463
But she lied about it.

429
00:21:01.496 --> 00:21:02.631
She didn't lie.

430
00:21:02.664 --> 00:21:04.032
She just...

431
00:21:04.066 --> 00:21:05.434
she didn't wanna tell me,

432
00:21:05.601 --> 00:21:07.269
because she didn't wanna get in trouble.

433
00:21:07.302 --> 00:21:08.904
[Cassandra] Well, speaking of trouble,

434
00:21:08.971 --> 00:21:11.373
has she gotten into
any trouble in her past?

435
00:21:11.406 --> 00:21:13.208
Michael hasn't mentioned anything.

436
00:21:13.275 --> 00:21:16.411
Well, Michael hasn't mentioned
a lot of things lately.

437
00:21:16.445 --> 00:21:17.946
Stop it, Rhonda.

438
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.548
I'm just saying.

439
00:21:19.615 --> 00:21:21.350
I can have Terrance do
a little bit of digging.

440
00:21:21.383 --> 00:21:22.751
It can't hurt.

441
00:21:22.784 --> 00:21:25.320
We are not looking into anything.

442
00:21:25.354 --> 00:21:27.889
Michael has told me everything.

443
00:21:27.923 --> 00:21:31.526
Well, new information about
your husband and his daughter.

444
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.096
Baby, sometimes there is more to the story

445
00:21:34.129 --> 00:21:36.064
than what we are told.

446
00:21:36.131 --> 00:21:38.467
I can have Terrance just
do a little digging into them.

447
00:21:38.533 --> 00:21:39.901
It cannot hurt.

448
00:21:39.935 --> 00:21:40.969
No.

449
00:21:41.003 --> 00:21:42.204
Michael is an amazing man

450
00:21:42.237 --> 00:21:43.338
with a sweet daughter,

451
00:21:43.372 --> 00:21:44.740
nothing more to the story.

452
00:21:44.906 --> 00:21:47.576
Yeah, but don't you
find it a little odd

453
00:21:47.643 --> 00:21:48.977
that he decided to wait

454
00:21:49.144 --> 00:21:51.146
until she popped up before he told you?

455
00:21:51.179 --> 00:21:53.849
No one expected her to pop up, Cass.

456
00:21:53.882 --> 00:21:56.852
[Rhonda] You know what, 
Whit, you're right.

457
00:21:56.918 --> 00:21:59.288
You should let it go. 
We should let it go.

458
00:22:00.355 --> 00:22:02.624
Let's do what we came here to do

459
00:22:02.658 --> 00:22:04.726
which is toast Whitney,

460
00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:08.196
sending her all the
good energy and positive vibes

461
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:10.265
for her big pitch tomorrow.

462
00:22:10.332 --> 00:22:11.633
Cheers!

463
00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.168
-Cheers. 
-Cheers to you.

464
00:22:13.235 --> 00:22:14.670
-Love you guys. 
-Love you.

-Hmm.

Hmm. I'm up.

-I'm up, I'm up, I'm up. 
-You up?

472
00:22:33.055 --> 00:22:34.122
Yeah.

473
00:22:35.123 --> 00:22:36.391
Good morning, baby.

474
00:22:39.328 --> 00:22:40.962
You ready for the big day?

475
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:42.464
Oh, goodness.

476
00:22:43.498 --> 00:22:44.700
Yeah.

477
00:22:44.766 --> 00:22:46.034
I'm ready, ready.

478
00:22:46.068 --> 00:22:47.069
Well, go get ready then.

479

[laughs]

480
00:22:50.539 --> 00:22:51.873
Okay, baby.

481
00:22:51.907 --> 00:22:53.675
And I'll get your breakfast ready.

482
00:22:56.478 --> 00:22:57.579
Even better.

483
00:22:57.612 --> 00:22:59.081
[Michael] Uh-hmm.

484
00:22:59.114 --> 00:23:02.084
[dramatic music]

485
00:23:03.452 --> 00:23:04.986
Okay, ladies.

486
00:23:05.053 --> 00:23:06.321
Show 'em what we got.

487
00:23:09.191 --> 00:23:10.992
-Hi. 
-[man] Hey.

488
00:23:11.026 --> 00:23:12.194
Have a seat.

489
00:23:13.428 --> 00:23:14.963
Hello, everybody. Thank you.

490
00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:16.898
-Mrs. Lawrence, I presume. 
-Yes.

491
00:23:16.965 --> 00:23:20.268
Mr. Robertson, it is so nice
to finally meet you in person.

492
00:23:20.302 --> 00:23:21.703
Likewise.

493
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.071
Really looking forward to this one.

494
00:23:23.138 --> 00:23:25.140
-Great. 
-Well, let's get started.

495
00:23:25.207 --> 00:23:26.975
Wonderful.

496
00:23:27.008 --> 00:23:28.744
Uh, we've taken the liberty
to place my business prospectus

497
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:30.245
in front of you there,

498
00:23:30.278 --> 00:23:33.181
so please feel free to take a look.

499
00:23:34.216 --> 00:23:35.751
[associate] Oh, wow.

500
00:23:35.784 --> 00:23:37.419
-This is nice. 
-Yeah.

501
00:23:37.452 --> 00:23:39.388
Nice.

502
00:23:42.657 --> 00:23:45.727
So as you can
see, my primers all have

503
00:23:45.794 --> 00:23:48.263
a very nice golden undertone.

504
00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.165
And you said this is all natural ingredients?

505
00:23:50.232 --> 00:23:51.366
[Whitney] Oh, absolutely.

506
00:23:51.433 --> 00:23:54.503
I rely heavily on a coconut

507
00:23:54.569 --> 00:23:56.571
and aloe vera base.

508
00:23:56.638 --> 00:23:58.073
According to our researchers,

509
00:23:58.140 --> 00:23:59.374
you've done very well for yourself.

510
00:24:00.442 --> 00:24:02.544
So tell me why
change your sales strategy now

511
00:24:02.611 --> 00:24:04.713
and get in bed with us?

512
00:24:04.746 --> 00:24:07.549
It's simple, Mr. Robertson.

513
00:24:07.616 --> 00:24:10.919
Your stores can target
young, low income Black women

514
00:24:10.952 --> 00:24:13.922
and I simply cannot.

515
00:24:13.989 --> 00:24:15.357
Great answer.

516
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.592
-[Whitney] Thank you. 
-[model] Um, Whit?

517
00:24:17.626 --> 00:24:20.362
I'm really sorry, but I think
I need to go wash this off.

518
00:24:20.395 --> 00:24:21.329
One second. Yeah.

519
00:24:21.396 --> 00:24:22.964
Uh, wait. What?

520
00:24:22.998 --> 00:24:24.499
Are you serious?

521
00:24:24.533 --> 00:24:26.201
[gasps]

522
00:24:26.234 --> 00:24:28.303
Um, I think I'm
having some type of reaction.

523
00:24:28.336 --> 00:24:30.005
-[Whitney] Okay. 
-No, me too.

524
00:24:30.038 --> 00:24:31.072
I thought I was going
crazy, but it doesn't feel right.

525
00:24:31.106 --> 00:24:32.507
Okay. Okay. One second.

526
00:24:32.574 --> 00:24:37.112
Um, this, uh, normally doesn't happen.

527
00:24:37.179 --> 00:24:38.480
Okay. Here. Here.

528
00:24:38.547 --> 00:24:39.981
Ooh, it feels like
my face is on fire.

529
00:24:40.015 --> 00:24:43.318
-Oh, are you serious? 
-[groaning]

530
00:24:43.385 --> 00:24:44.820
Oh, my God.

531
00:24:44.853 --> 00:24:46.855
[screaming]

532
00:24:46.888 --> 00:24:48.023
Shh.

533
00:24:49.124 --> 00:24:50.692
[screaming]

534
00:24:50.759 --> 00:24:51.860
Oh, my God!

535
00:24:53.595 --> 00:24:55.597
I
-I am-
-I am so sorry.

536
00:24:57.065 --> 00:24:58.600
I promise this has never happened.

537
00:24:59.468 --> 00:25:00.635
Are you okay?

538
00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:02.103
Keep it back on.

539
00:25:03.371 --> 00:25:04.973
Someone call 911!

540
00:25:08.477 --> 00:25:11.546
[somber music]

541
00:25:14.316 --> 00:25:15.617
[Whitney] Michael?

542
00:25:18.487 --> 00:25:20.155
Michael?

543
00:25:20.222 --> 00:25:21.490
[Michael] I'm here.

544
00:25:24.459 --> 00:25:26.695
Hey, what's wrong? No.

545
00:25:28.697 --> 00:25:29.731
What happened?

546
00:25:29.764 --> 00:25:32.567
I was...I don't know.

547
00:25:32.634 --> 00:25:34.803
It was terrible. Just...

548
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.505
[Michael] It's okay, baby. I'm here.

549
00:25:36.571 --> 00:25:38.139
[sobs]

550
00:25:38.173 --> 00:25:39.241
Tell me what happened.

551
00:25:39.307 --> 00:25:40.775
I can't. Oh, my God.

552
00:25:53.255 --> 00:25:54.556
[water gushing]

553
00:25:57.926 --> 00:25:59.127
[Joanna] Hi.

554
00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.195
Hi.

555
00:26:00.228 --> 00:26:01.396
Sorry.

556
00:26:01.429 --> 00:26:02.998
It's okay.

557
00:26:04.966 --> 00:26:06.201
-Hi. 
-Hi. I just--

558
00:26:06.234 --> 00:26:07.636
I just wanted to tell you

559
00:26:07.702 --> 00:26:09.704
that my dad told me what happened.

560
00:26:09.771 --> 00:26:13.308
I'm so sorry that everything fell through.

561
00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:16.478
-Oh, thank you, Joanna. 
-[Joanna] Yeah.

562
00:26:16.511 --> 00:26:19.648
Uh, and there's gonna be other opportunities.

563
00:26:19.714 --> 00:26:20.949
Yeah, for sure.

564
00:26:22.984 --> 00:26:26.354
So I just wanted to
ask if your offer still stands.

565
00:26:27.522 --> 00:26:29.257
What offer?

566
00:26:29.291 --> 00:26:30.659
[Joanna] A girls' day would be good.

567
00:26:30.725 --> 00:26:32.027
Oh, yeah.

568
00:26:32.093 --> 00:26:34.362
Yes. Uh, why don't...yes.

569
00:26:34.396 --> 00:26:36.565
Let's do it this Saturday.

570
00:26:36.631 --> 00:26:37.799
That sounds great.

571
00:26:37.832 --> 00:26:38.767
-Works for me. 
-[Whitney] Yeah.

572
00:26:38.833 --> 00:26:40.802
Yeah. Me too.

573
00:26:40.869 --> 00:26:42.938
All right. Well, see you tomorrow.

574
00:26:42.971 --> 00:26:43.972
-Good night. 
-[Whitney] Yes.

575
00:26:44.005 --> 00:26:45.473
Okay. Good night.

576
00:26:55.517 --> 00:26:58.587
[suspenseful music]

577
00:27:36.625 --> 00:27:37.926
[sighs]

578
00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.697
[Joanna] What is this? Fluxamine?

579
00:27:42.764 --> 00:27:43.765
Hmm.

580
00:27:43.832 --> 00:27:47.936
[foreboding music]

581
00:28:09.824 --> 00:28:12.027
This is exactly what we needed.

582
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.495
I know, right?

583
00:28:17.699 --> 00:28:19.868
So did my dad ever explain to you

584
00:28:19.934 --> 00:28:22.070
why I've been living in Louisiana?

585
00:28:23.171 --> 00:28:25.674
He brought it up.

586
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.043
And what did he say?

587
00:28:28.076 --> 00:28:32.580
Uh, just that he
hit a really rough patch

588
00:28:32.647 --> 00:28:34.315
when your mom passed,

589
00:28:35.483 --> 00:28:38.586
which is why you went
to go stay with your grandmother.

590
00:28:38.653 --> 00:28:40.922
Yeah. I guess it's the gist of it.

591
00:28:42.924 --> 00:28:44.859
[Whitney] I want you to know
that you don't have to worry

592
00:28:44.893 --> 00:28:47.495
about anything like that ever happening here.

593
00:28:47.529 --> 00:28:50.532
Your dad's in a really good place and...

594
00:28:52.667 --> 00:28:54.703
the past is the past for a reason.

595
00:28:54.736 --> 00:28:56.838
Aw. Thanks, Whit.

596
00:28:56.905 --> 00:28:58.606
But I'm not scared it'll happen again.

597
00:28:59.974 --> 00:29:01.042
Good.

598
00:29:03.445 --> 00:29:05.914
I am so tired.

599
00:29:16.124 --> 00:29:17.392
Oh, I'm not feeling very well.

600
00:29:17.425 --> 00:29:19.060
[Joanna] Oh, no.

601
00:29:20.061 --> 00:29:21.296
Can you drive?

602
00:29:21.362 --> 00:29:22.597
Yeah, of course.

603
00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:23.865
Are you--are you okay with that?

604
00:29:23.898 --> 00:29:25.266
Yeah, I have my license.

605
00:29:25.333 --> 00:29:26.434
Okay.

606
00:29:26.468 --> 00:29:28.470
I'm gonna...oh gosh.

607
00:29:28.503 --> 00:29:30.271
Let me take this. Are you okay?

608
00:29:30.338 --> 00:29:33.975
[groans] This is so strange.

609
00:29:37.312 --> 00:29:38.546
I've got you.

610
00:29:38.613 --> 00:29:40.081
Thank you.

611
00:29:40.148 --> 00:29:41.616
Okay.

612
00:29:43.585 --> 00:29:44.486
Just gonna need--

613
00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:46.054
[Joanna] Okay. Slow.

614
00:29:51.926 --> 00:29:53.628
Watch your step, baby.

615
00:29:53.695 --> 00:29:55.196
I see it, baby.

616
00:29:55.263 --> 00:29:57.398
-It's not funny. 
-[laughs]

617
00:29:57.432 --> 00:29:59.434
This is just silly.

618
00:29:59.467 --> 00:30:00.702
-Get-- 
-I--

619
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:02.270
-Easy. 
-Uh-huh. I told you.

620
00:30:02.337 --> 00:30:04.339
-Nuh-uh, relax. 
-Ugh.

621
00:30:04.405 --> 00:30:06.908
Stop fussing over me. I'm fine.

622
00:30:06.975 --> 00:30:08.743
-You're fine? 
-Yes.

623
00:30:08.777 --> 00:30:11.613
Joanna told me you literally
almost fell on your face

624
00:30:11.646 --> 00:30:13.281
when you came out of the spa.

625
00:30:13.348 --> 00:30:16.284
Yeah. Well, lucky for me she was there.

626
00:30:16.317 --> 00:30:17.852
Lucky for you, huh?

627
00:30:21.022 --> 00:30:22.190
You know what? 
I'm not going on my trip.

628
00:30:22.257 --> 00:30:23.558
What?

629
00:30:23.625 --> 00:30:25.293
Yeah. No, I'm canceling my business trip.

630
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.661
Why?

631
00:30:26.728 --> 00:30:28.163
What do you mean why?

632
00:30:28.196 --> 00:30:29.898
Between what happened to you at your meeting

633
00:30:29.964 --> 00:30:31.199
and the day you almost passing out?

634
00:30:31.232 --> 00:30:32.700
Oh, my gosh.

635
00:30:32.767 --> 00:30:34.469
Clearly, I don't need
to leave you right now.

636
00:30:34.502 --> 00:30:36.738
I need to be here so
I can take care of you.

637
00:30:37.772 --> 00:30:39.240
Don't be ridiculous.

638
00:30:39.307 --> 00:30:42.577
And you've been planning this trip for months.

639
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.879
[Michael] Yeah, I have.

640
00:30:44.946 --> 00:30:47.615
But what am I supposed to do, Whit?

641
00:30:49.818 --> 00:30:51.753
Take the trip

642
00:30:51.786 --> 00:30:53.655
and go to your real estate conference,

643
00:30:53.721 --> 00:30:56.524
and it'll give Joanna and I

644
00:30:56.558 --> 00:31:00.161
some time to spend together and bond.

645
00:31:00.228 --> 00:31:03.064
Trust me. I'm fine.

646
00:31:03.097 --> 00:31:05.166
-[Michael] Trust you? 
-Uh-hmm.

647
00:31:05.233 --> 00:31:06.301
[sigh]

648
00:31:07.535 --> 00:31:09.571
Well, can you at
least go to the doctor

649
00:31:09.604 --> 00:31:11.339
so you can make sure everything is okay?

650
00:31:11.406 --> 00:31:12.640
I'm serious.

651
00:31:12.674 --> 00:31:14.809
Baby, I'm fine.

652
00:31:14.876 --> 00:31:16.878
I have the boys and Joanna.

653
00:31:16.945 --> 00:31:19.614
They'll take care of
me if I need them.

654
00:31:19.681 --> 00:31:22.283
All right. All right.

655
00:31:22.317 --> 00:31:24.552
I'm gonna think about it.

656
00:31:24.586 --> 00:31:26.120
But until then,

657
00:31:27.121 --> 00:31:31.226
can you promise me that you
will relax and get some rest?

658
00:31:31.259 --> 00:31:32.927
I'll think about it.

659
00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.469
[suspenseful music]

660
00:32:09.397 --> 00:32:11.165
[Eric] What are you doing?

661
00:32:11.232 --> 00:32:13.067
Minding my own business.

662
00:32:13.134 --> 00:32:15.503
Something you should learn how to do.

663
00:32:17.238 --> 00:32:20.141
I know you did something to my mom.

664
00:32:20.208 --> 00:32:21.676
What are you talking about?

665
00:32:23.678 --> 00:32:26.481
She left and she was totally fine.

666
00:32:26.547 --> 00:32:29.584
She came back and she fell out.

667
00:32:29.651 --> 00:32:31.452
Listen here, chief.

668
00:32:31.519 --> 00:32:33.955
And I'm only gonna tell you this once.

669
00:32:33.988 --> 00:32:37.225
You need to be careful
what you accuse me of.

670
00:32:37.258 --> 00:32:38.660
You don't know me.

671
00:32:38.726 --> 00:32:40.395
And you don't know me.

672
00:32:40.461 --> 00:32:43.097
You don't wanna get on my bad side.

673
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:45.033
I can be a dream

674
00:32:45.099 --> 00:32:47.402
or your worst nightmare.

675
00:32:49.604 --> 00:32:50.972
I'm watching you.

676
00:32:51.005 --> 00:32:53.241
I'm watching you.

677
00:32:53.274 --> 00:32:55.510
And if you want
your mommy to be okay,

678
00:32:55.576 --> 00:32:57.512
you didn't see anything tonight.

679
00:32:57.545 --> 00:33:01.115

[eerie music]

684
00:34:34.876 --> 00:34:37.412
[Whitney] Yeah. No, I'll be fine.

685
00:34:37.445 --> 00:34:39.514
I just need to take
some time away from the office.

686
00:34:41.182 --> 00:34:42.950
You know, clear my head a little

687
00:34:43.017 --> 00:34:45.019
after everything that happened.

688
00:34:45.086 --> 00:34:48.289
Um, did you take care
of the lady's medical costs?

689
00:34:50.324 --> 00:34:51.592
Oh, yeah, for sure.

690
00:34:51.626 --> 00:34:53.394
Hold on.

691
00:34:54.695 --> 00:34:57.799
Uh, I don't know
where my credit card is.

692
00:34:57.832 --> 00:35:00.201
Uh, have you guys seen my credit card?

693
00:35:00.234 --> 00:35:02.770
Uh, no. No.

694
00:35:02.804 --> 00:35:05.139
Um, hold on. Let
me call you back. Okay?

695
00:35:05.173 --> 00:35:06.641
[Joanna] The grapes are here.

696
00:35:06.707 --> 00:35:08.976
Eric, baby, have you seen my credit card?

697
00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.012
No, I haven't seen it.

698
00:35:12.947 --> 00:35:14.015
Joanna, have you seen it?

699
00:35:14.082 --> 00:35:15.149
[Joanna] Seen what?

700
00:35:15.183 --> 00:35:16.784
[Whitney] My credit card.

701
00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:18.052
Your credit card?

702
00:35:18.086 --> 00:35:19.687
Why are you asking me?

703
00:35:19.754 --> 00:35:21.155
I'm asking you because

704
00:35:21.189 --> 00:35:22.557
the last time I remember using it

705
00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.392
was at the spa
when I was with you.

706
00:35:24.425 --> 00:35:25.526
No.

707
00:35:25.593 --> 00:35:27.128
Well, I really don't appreciate

708
00:35:27.195 --> 00:35:29.097
your little passive-aggressive accusation.

709
00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:31.532
First of all, I
didn't accuse you of anything.

710
00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:34.469
I asked you the same
question that I asked the boys.

711
00:35:34.535 --> 00:35:36.471
Hey, just cut the shit.

712
00:35:36.504 --> 00:35:38.072
[Whitney] Excuse me? 
What did you just say?

713
00:35:38.139 --> 00:35:40.842
I said cut the shit, Whit.

714
00:35:40.908 --> 00:35:42.477
Hey!

715
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.612
You need to watch your
mouth in my house, little girl.

716
00:35:44.679 --> 00:35:46.814
Oh, in your house? [scoffs]

717
00:35:46.881 --> 00:35:48.483
This is what this
is all about, isn't it?

718
00:35:48.516 --> 00:35:49.851
Your house?

719
00:35:49.884 --> 00:35:52.019
And I am not your little girl.

720
00:35:52.086 --> 00:35:54.455
-[Michael] Hey. 
Hey, hey, hey! 
-You--

721
00:35:54.522 --> 00:35:56.090
What was all that about?

722
00:35:56.124 --> 00:35:57.959
[Joanna] Your wife here is accusing me

723
00:35:57.992 --> 00:35:59.227
of stealing her credit card.

724
00:35:59.293 --> 00:36:00.862
I didn't accuse her of anything.

725
00:36:00.895 --> 00:36:02.396
-Yeah, she did. 
-[Michael] Baby.

726
00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:03.598
She did.

727
00:36:04.832 --> 00:36:06.434
[sigh] All right.

728
00:36:06.467 --> 00:36:07.768
You mean this credit card?

729
00:36:07.802 --> 00:36:09.504
[Joanna scoffs]

730
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:10.571
Yes.

731
00:36:10.638 --> 00:36:11.772
Where did you find it?

732
00:36:12.807 --> 00:36:13.975
You left it on the dresser.

733
00:36:14.008 --> 00:36:16.177
I'm not shocked.

734
00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.412
Joanna, we need to talk.

735
00:36:18.446 --> 00:36:19.881
I'm done with this conversation.

736
00:36:20.948 --> 00:36:23.217
You two, come with me. 
I'd like to speak to you.

737
00:36:27.488 --> 00:36:28.723
You can go.

738
00:36:31.926 --> 00:36:33.394
What the hell was that?

739
00:36:33.461 --> 00:36:35.363
I asked her had she seen my card,

740
00:36:35.396 --> 00:36:36.631
just like I asked the boys.

741
00:36:36.697 --> 00:36:38.132
It was a simple question.

742
00:36:38.166 --> 00:36:39.333
-You need to go check her. 
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

743
00:36:39.367 --> 00:36:41.636
-She's out of line. 
-I will.

744
00:36:41.702 --> 00:36:44.305
It's not really like you to accuse anyone,

745
00:36:44.338 --> 00:36:45.773
but still, come on, baby.

746
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.309
Joanna's a teenager.

747
00:36:48.342 --> 00:36:49.777
She's full of emotion, man.

748
00:36:49.844 --> 00:36:53.648
She just lost her grandmother, so, yeah.

749
00:36:53.681 --> 00:36:56.417
And she's probably on her little...teenage period,

750
00:36:56.484 --> 00:36:58.452
monthly woman thing, whatever y'all do.

751
00:36:58.486 --> 00:37:01.255
So, yeah, she probably is crazy right now.

752
00:37:01.322 --> 00:37:02.924
You know what, look,

753
00:37:02.957 --> 00:37:05.193
I was worse when I was 17.

754
00:37:05.259 --> 00:37:07.361
There you go.

755
00:37:07.395 --> 00:37:09.530
-I'mma talk to her, all right? 
-Okay.

756
00:37:10.865 --> 00:37:11.999
But stop fighting with my daughter.

757
00:37:12.033 --> 00:37:14.135
Get outta here. I'm trying.

758
00:37:18.206 --> 00:37:20.007
God, I cannot catch a break.

759
00:37:28.049 --> 00:37:29.383
[taps]

760
00:37:33.421 --> 00:37:34.589
Hello?

761
00:37:36.257 --> 00:37:37.658
-[taps] 
-Hello?

762
00:37:42.863 --> 00:37:44.298
[taps]

763
00:38:04.619 --> 00:38:05.720
Hey.

764
00:38:05.753 --> 00:38:07.622
What are you doing out here?

765
00:38:07.688 --> 00:38:09.890
My God, Jesus, you scared me.

766
00:38:11.092 --> 00:38:12.226
I couldn't sleep.

767
00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.628
[Eric] I know what you're doing.

768
00:38:13.661 --> 00:38:14.862
I'm not five.

769
00:38:14.929 --> 00:38:16.497
I saw you smoking weed.

770
00:38:19.934 --> 00:38:24.171
Listen. Why don't you come take
a seat right next to me?

771
00:38:29.477 --> 00:38:31.512
Look...

772
00:38:31.545 --> 00:38:32.580
you'll be fine.

773
00:38:32.647 --> 00:38:33.814
Just sit down.

774
00:38:33.881 --> 00:38:34.949
Oh.

775
00:38:37.618 --> 00:38:38.886
Listen, buddy.

776
00:38:40.288 --> 00:38:42.823
I feel like we got
off on the wrong foot.

777
00:38:43.424 --> 00:38:45.359
You know, we're brother and sister now.

778
00:38:45.393 --> 00:38:47.662
We should establish a
real bond with each other

779
00:38:47.728 --> 00:38:50.064
where we can keep secrets to ourselves.

780
00:38:51.632 --> 00:38:53.901
What do you say? Truce?

781
00:38:55.036 --> 00:38:56.370
You're just trying to be nice to me

782
00:38:56.404 --> 00:38:58.105
so I don't snitch on you, huh?

783
00:38:58.172 --> 00:39:00.007
[tense music]

784
00:39:07.915 --> 00:39:09.317
[Eric] What are you doing?

785
00:39:09.383 --> 00:39:11.185
Is it working?

786
00:39:13.387 --> 00:39:14.622
A little.

787
00:39:16.824 --> 00:39:18.259
Come on.

788
00:39:18.326 --> 00:39:20.561
-[laughs] 
-Truce.

789
00:39:25.299 --> 00:39:27.001
Have you ever had a beer before?

790
00:39:28.602 --> 00:39:29.970
I'm 12 years old.

791
00:39:30.037 --> 00:39:31.505
Why would I have a beer?

792
00:39:31.572 --> 00:39:34.508
I started drinking beer when I was 11.

793
00:39:34.542 --> 00:39:36.444
Here. You should try one.

794
00:39:39.547 --> 00:39:41.015
You're crazy.

795
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.686
Look at the view. It's nice.

796
00:39:50.791 --> 00:39:53.961
Here. Here's a beer. 
You should try it.

797
00:39:53.994 --> 00:39:55.629
You'll like it. I promise.

798
00:39:55.663 --> 00:39:57.565
They say real men drink beer.

799
00:40:08.075 --> 00:40:09.377
Hmm.

800
00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:11.512
It's not that bad.

801
00:40:11.579 --> 00:40:13.047
I knew you'd say that.

802
00:40:13.114 --> 00:40:14.181
I knew you'd love it.

803
00:40:16.384 --> 00:40:18.552
It's not the best.

804
00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:20.287
I wonder how much you can drink.

805
00:40:34.502 --> 00:40:35.836
I
-I feel dizzy.

806
00:40:36.904 --> 00:40:38.105
Why don't you have another one?

807
00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.008
-Another one? 
-[can hisses]

808
00:40:41.041 --> 00:40:42.476
Yeah.

809
00:40:42.543 --> 00:40:43.677
I don't feel like...

810
00:40:45.346 --> 00:40:46.847
I should have another one.

811
00:40:46.881 --> 00:40:47.948
Why not?

812
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:50.618
You're doing so good.

813
00:40:55.923 --> 00:40:57.291
Babe?

814
00:40:57.958 --> 00:41:00.394
Wanna drink together? Cheers?

815
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:10.971
So good.

816
00:41:11.005 --> 00:41:12.706
Why are you making that face? 
You know you like it.

817
00:41:14.375 --> 00:41:15.443
Babe?

818
00:41:20.414 --> 00:41:21.449
You know...

819
00:41:22.883 --> 00:41:25.953
people are always complaining
about being an only child.

820
00:41:27.955 --> 00:41:29.790
It was lonely and they
wish they had more kids

821
00:41:29.857 --> 00:41:30.925
in the house with them.

822
00:41:31.959 --> 00:41:33.661
You know, I actually didn't mind it.

823
00:41:34.895 --> 00:41:37.965
Hell, actually, I enjoyed it.

824
00:41:37.998 --> 00:41:40.634
I got all the toys to myself,

825
00:41:40.701 --> 00:41:42.136
I didn't have to deal

826
00:41:42.203 --> 00:41:44.205
with any other little boys around me.

827
00:41:45.172 --> 00:41:47.107
It was great.

828
00:41:47.141 --> 00:41:51.078
Then my dad decided to
play Super Dad for your family.

829
00:41:51.145 --> 00:41:53.647
Got to deal with you little rascals.

830
00:41:57.351 --> 00:41:58.419
It's fine.

831
00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:03.557
Hello?

832
00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.896
Now I have to
take care of this mess.

833
00:42:08.929 --> 00:42:10.297
Ugh.

834
00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:18.472
It's time for you to die.

835
00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:20.608
[Michael] Babe. What?

836
00:42:22.977 --> 00:42:24.311
Babe, what are you doing?

837
00:42:28.015 --> 00:42:29.650
-[Whitney gasps] 
-No!

838
00:42:31.485 --> 00:42:33.220
[sighs] Dammit.

839
00:42:34.321 --> 00:42:35.489
What are you doing?

840
00:42:35.556 --> 00:42:37.291
I don't know. I don't know.

841
00:42:37.324 --> 00:42:39.159
I don't know how I got out here.

842
00:42:39.193 --> 00:42:40.461
-Oh, my God. 
-Are you...

843
00:42:40.528 --> 00:42:42.663
-are you sleepwalking? 
-I dunno.

844
00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:45.633
I
-I
-I had, uh, a dream. And...

845
00:42:45.699 --> 00:42:47.835
-Baby, you could've drowned. 
-I know.

846
00:42:47.902 --> 00:42:49.370
[whimpers]

847
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:51.038
Come on.

848
00:42:53.474 --> 00:42:54.542
Okay.

849
00:42:56.744 --> 00:42:59.813
[dramatic music]

850
00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:04.451
All right, guys. 
About to get outta here.

851
00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:08.322
-[chuckles] 
-See y'all in about two weeks.

852
00:43:08.389 --> 00:43:10.357
-Peace out. 
-Oh, yeah, "Peace out"?

853
00:43:10.391 --> 00:43:12.560
-Oh, you a tough guy now? 
-Oh, yeah.

854
00:43:12.593 --> 00:43:15.195
Take care of your mom, tough guy.

855
00:43:15.262 --> 00:43:16.830
Safe travels.

856
00:43:16.864 --> 00:43:18.399
Thank you, bro.

857
00:43:18.432 --> 00:43:20.301
Mr. Lawrence, you take care.

858
00:43:21.335 --> 00:43:22.937
You two take care.

859
00:43:23.003 --> 00:43:24.505
-You watch him. 
-Bye, Dad.

860
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.742
-Have a safe trip. 
-Up the stairs.

861
00:43:29.877 --> 00:43:31.378
You in charge now, all right?

862
00:43:31.445 --> 00:43:32.913
[Joanna laughs]

863
00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:34.281
You take care of the house.

864
00:43:35.816 --> 00:43:37.818
Oh, a house full of kids.

865
00:43:37.851 --> 00:43:40.120
Yeah, you and all your kids.

866
00:43:40.187 --> 00:43:42.790
-Lucky me. [laughs] 
-Uh-hmm.

867
00:43:42.823 --> 00:43:44.625
You know I don't wanna leave you, right?

868
00:43:44.692 --> 00:43:46.760
Baby. Go. I'll be fine.

869
00:43:46.794 --> 00:43:48.762
You'll be fine?

870
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:50.564
How can you say
you're gonna be fine, baby,

871
00:43:50.598 --> 00:43:52.266
with all this stuff
that's been happening to you?

872
00:43:52.299 --> 00:43:54.134
I promise it's not gonna happen again.

873
00:43:54.168 --> 00:43:56.036
Okay. What if we wasn't here?

874
00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:59.306
I'll lock the bedroom
door. Just in case. Okay?

875
00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.674
Don't worry.

876
00:44:00.708 --> 00:44:02.109
I can cancel the trip.

877
00:44:02.142 --> 00:44:03.110
I don't have to go.

878
00:44:03.143 --> 00:44:05.312
Don't worry, okay?

879
00:44:05.346 --> 00:44:07.281
-Now you gonna go. Get out. 
-Oh.

880
00:44:07.348 --> 00:44:08.482
-[giggles] Come on. 
-You're kicking me out now?

881
00:44:08.549 --> 00:44:09.984
Yes.

882
00:44:10.017 --> 00:44:11.452
You got somebody else coming over here?

883
00:44:11.518 --> 00:44:12.920
[laughs]

884
00:44:12.953 --> 00:44:15.889
That's for me to know
and for you to find out.

885
00:44:15.956 --> 00:44:17.458
-I'll be calling you. 
-Okay.

886
00:44:17.524 --> 00:44:19.259
-Every chance I get. 
-Out.

887
00:44:20.594 --> 00:44:21.662
Safe travels.

888
00:44:32.139 --> 00:44:34.208
[phone rings]

889
00:44:39.513 --> 00:44:40.814
Hello?

890
00:44:40.848 --> 00:44:43.050
This is Kevin from Quick
-Chem-labs.

891
00:44:43.083 --> 00:44:45.185
I'm calling about those
make-up samples you sent us.

892
00:44:45.252 --> 00:44:46.620
Yes.

893
00:44:46.687 --> 00:44:48.789
Did you find out
what happened with my samples?

894
00:44:48.822 --> 00:44:50.190
Yes, ma'am.

895
00:44:50.257 --> 00:44:53.427
So most of the samples are perfectly fine

896
00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:57.531
but I don't know, some
of them have a high concentration

897
00:44:57.564 --> 00:45:00.067
of sodium hydroxide.

898
00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.436
Sodium hydroxide?

899
00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:05.105
Yeah, they're mixed in.

900
00:45:05.139 --> 00:45:07.508
How would lye get into my...

901
00:45:07.541 --> 00:45:11.779
[Kevin] Listen, ma'am, as-as you
know, lye is highly toxic.

902
00:45:11.812 --> 00:45:13.180
Okay. Thank-thank you.

903
00:45:13.213 --> 00:45:14.281
You're welcome.

904
00:45:15.582 --> 00:45:18.652
[dramatic music]

905
00:45:34.902 --> 00:45:36.537
[utensils rattling]

906
00:46:21.381 --> 00:46:22.449
[door closes]

907
00:46:27.554 --> 00:46:28.655
[sighs]

908
00:46:41.401 --> 00:46:43.036
Joanna, hi.

909
00:46:43.103 --> 00:46:45.038
Hi. Lose something?

910
00:46:47.407 --> 00:46:52.346
Yeah, I was looking for
a cleaner that I had,

911
00:46:52.412 --> 00:46:54.848
that might've gotten into my makeup samples.

912
00:46:54.882 --> 00:46:56.750
Would you happen to know anything about that?

913
00:46:56.784 --> 00:46:59.486
No. Not a thing.

914
00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:01.822
But if I were you, 
I would be a little more careful

915
00:47:01.889 --> 00:47:05.492
about what I leave lying around.

916
00:47:27.548 --> 00:47:30.350
Hey. I need to talk to you now.

917
00:47:33.153 --> 00:47:35.422
Mike is out of
town and I don't think--

918
00:47:35.455 --> 00:47:38.091
Okay. Just spit it out. What is it?

919
00:47:38.158 --> 00:47:40.027
I changed my mind.

920
00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.429
I do want you to ask
Terrance to look into Joanna for me

921
00:47:42.462 --> 00:47:44.965
-if you could, please? 
-Yes, of course, of course.

922
00:47:45.032 --> 00:47:46.900
But why the sudden change of heart?

923
00:47:46.934 --> 00:47:49.503
I don't know. I just...I have...

924
00:47:50.003 --> 00:47:51.638
this funny feeling.

925
00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:54.641
Before, she was so sweet.

926
00:47:54.675 --> 00:47:57.611
And now...I don't know, 
I thought we were getting along.

927
00:47:57.678 --> 00:47:59.112
Okay, so what happened?

928
00:47:59.146 --> 00:48:01.381
You know the disaster
at work with my products?

929
00:48:01.448 --> 00:48:02.749
Yeah?

930
00:48:02.783 --> 00:48:04.318
So I talked to the chemist this morning

931
00:48:04.351 --> 00:48:07.387
and he proceeds to tell
me that they detected lye

932
00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:09.089
in my samples.

933
00:48:09.122 --> 00:48:11.925
Joanna was the only one near those samples.

934
00:48:11.992 --> 00:48:13.594
So I'm going through the garbage,

935
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.429
trying to see maybe I left something.

936
00:48:15.462 --> 00:48:18.599
I don't know. And then she tells me,

937
00:48:18.665 --> 00:48:21.602
"Maybe you shouldn't leave stuff lying around."

938
00:48:21.635 --> 00:48:23.103
What?

939
00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:25.038
[Whitney] I don't even
think about it at first.

940
00:48:25.072 --> 00:48:28.141
And the other day I asked her, 
I can't find my credit card.

941
00:48:28.175 --> 00:48:29.543
I said, I'm searching for my credit card.

942
00:48:29.576 --> 00:48:31.111
I asked her, "Have you seen it?"

943
00:48:31.144 --> 00:48:32.980
And she flipped out on me.

944
00:48:33.013 --> 00:48:36.683
I'm like, I don't know. 
Maybe-maybe I'm going crazy.

945
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:39.786
No, no, you are not going crazy.

946
00:48:39.853 --> 00:48:43.457
I told you to
watch out for that kid.

947
00:48:44.524 --> 00:48:47.327
You sure I'm not overthinking this?

948
00:48:48.262 --> 00:48:49.997
I am sure.

949
00:48:50.063 --> 00:48:52.399
And if anyone is gonna
be staying in your home,

950
00:48:52.466 --> 00:48:54.701
you need to know everything about them.

951
00:48:56.336 --> 00:48:59.139
I will have Terrance do
a quick background check on her

952
00:48:59.206 --> 00:49:00.807
and see what he finds.

953
00:49:03.644 --> 00:49:05.379
Thanks, Cass.

954
00:49:05.412 --> 00:49:06.713
Of course, sis.

955
00:49:10.918 --> 00:49:12.386
[Dante] I don't hear you talking.

956
00:49:12.452 --> 00:49:13.654
[Brian] Yeah. Done.

957
00:49:13.687 --> 00:49:15.355
You're done. You're garbage.

958
00:49:15.389 --> 00:49:16.957
-Bro, I keep telling you. 
-You're trash.

959
00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:18.292
-Bro, you're cheating, bro. 
-[Brian] You're trash.

960
00:49:18.325 --> 00:49:19.526
-Bro, I keep telling you. 
-You're not good.

961
00:49:19.559 --> 00:49:21.094
-I'm done with the game. 
-All right, bro.

962
00:49:21.128 --> 00:49:23.530
I'm done with the game. 
That's about it. Wraps.

963
00:49:23.597 --> 00:49:25.899
-[laughs] 
-You're stupid, bro.

964
00:49:25.933 --> 00:49:27.401
Hey, bro, where's your, uh--

965
00:49:27.434 --> 00:49:30.037
where's your, uh...your stepsis at?

966
00:49:31.338 --> 00:49:33.206
Probably downstairs. Why?

967
00:49:35.842 --> 00:49:37.311
I mean, okay, bro. 
So, listen, like...

968
00:49:37.377 --> 00:49:39.112
Okay. Come on, bro.

969
00:49:39.146 --> 00:49:41.181
We've been...look, so we've been
texting back and forth, right?

970
00:49:41.214 --> 00:49:42.516
Why you acting all funny about it?

971
00:49:42.549 --> 00:49:43.917
Y'all not even blood-related.

972
00:49:45.419 --> 00:49:47.621
And I'm not gonna
lie, she's been on one.

973
00:49:47.688 --> 00:49:50.791
Look at this, uh--look at this
picture she sent me right here.

974
00:49:50.824 --> 00:49:52.025
-Bro, look at this one. 
-No.

975
00:49:52.059 --> 00:49:53.760
Look at that one.

976
00:49:53.827 --> 00:49:56.296
Stop. Stop.

977
00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:57.597
Stop. Stop.

978
00:49:57.664 --> 00:49:59.099
-Oh. Hey, well... 
-That's not okay.

979
00:49:59.166 --> 00:50:00.233
[Dante] ...I gotta pee.

980
00:50:01.635 --> 00:50:03.170
Yeah.

981
00:50:03.203 --> 00:50:04.705
What are you telling me that for?

982
00:50:04.738 --> 00:50:06.073
You know where the bathroom is, right?

983
00:50:06.106 --> 00:50:08.075
[Dante] Oh, yeah. I got it.

984
00:50:08.141 --> 00:50:09.176
-Yup. 
-[Brian] Don't trip.

985
00:50:09.209 --> 00:50:11.111
Oh, yeah. I would never.

986
00:50:31.331 --> 00:50:32.599
Joanna.

987
00:50:35.202 --> 00:50:36.269
Hello?

988
00:50:37.404 --> 00:50:38.472
Hey, beautiful.

989
00:50:39.639 --> 00:50:40.707
It's me.

990
00:50:43.744 --> 00:50:44.978
Hey, yo.

991
00:50:46.813 --> 00:50:48.382
What is this?

992
00:50:56.656 --> 00:50:58.658
What the heck?

993
00:51:00.127 --> 00:51:03.497
Hey, yo, Brian, your sister is weird, bro.

994
00:51:07.968 --> 00:51:11.038
[suspenseful music]

995
00:51:13.373 --> 00:51:15.876
I mean, we might
as well see what's inside.

996
00:51:19.212 --> 00:51:21.281
Feel like I just hit the jackpot.

997
00:51:23.984 --> 00:51:27.154
[suspenseful music]

998
00:51:27.187 --> 00:51:29.256
[chuckles]

999
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:31.925
No way.

1000
00:51:34.861 --> 00:51:36.263
Was that a diary?

1001
00:51:44.004 --> 00:51:45.605
Oh, my God.

1002
00:51:45.639 --> 00:51:47.674
I gotta tell Brian about this.

1003
00:51:47.707 --> 00:51:48.775
[grunts]

1004
00:51:55.048 --> 00:51:58.085
[suspenseful music]

1005
00:52:26.179 --> 00:52:28.148
[Joanna] Okay. Go Brian. Go Eric.

1006
00:52:29.216 --> 00:52:31.485
You got it, big head.

1007
00:52:32.786 --> 00:52:34.287
Yeah!

1008
00:52:36.456 --> 00:52:38.525
[crickets chirping]

1009
00:52:41.695 --> 00:52:42.896
[Joanna] Hello, Whitney.

1010
00:52:44.731 --> 00:52:47.367
Oh, I just had the most terrific day.

1011
00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:48.735
I took the boys to the park

1012
00:52:48.768 --> 00:52:50.437
and I watched them play basketball.

1013
00:52:52.038 --> 00:52:53.507
How was your day?

1014
00:52:54.841 --> 00:52:57.477
Work as usual.

1015
00:53:00.547 --> 00:53:03.016
I need to take this.

1016
00:53:12.626 --> 00:53:14.661
-Cass. 
-You're on speaker.

1017
00:53:14.694 --> 00:53:16.596
-It's me and Terrance. 
-Hey, Whit.

1018
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:18.532
Hey, y'all. How's it going?

1019
00:53:18.598 --> 00:53:20.100
[Terrance] So I was
able to pull some strings

1020
00:53:20.167 --> 00:53:22.135
and some information about your stepdaughter.

1021
00:53:22.202 --> 00:53:24.171
Joanna Lawrence isn't her real name.

1022
00:53:24.237 --> 00:53:25.705
It's actually Maggie Dillon.

1023
00:53:26.907 --> 00:53:28.675
-What? 
-[Terrance] Yeah.

1024
00:53:29.543 --> 00:53:31.878
So I started checking out her online presence

1025
00:53:31.912 --> 00:53:35.482
and I couldn't find anything,
so I dug a little deeper.

1026
00:53:35.515 --> 00:53:37.551
So apparently, 
Joanna Lawrence

1027
00:53:37.584 --> 00:53:39.152
been going by this name for years.

1028
00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:42.589
Does she have a juvie record?

1029
00:53:42.622 --> 00:53:45.859
Just a couple minor
infractions but, uh, nothing alarming.

1030
00:53:45.892 --> 00:53:47.727
What about Michael?

1031
00:53:47.761 --> 00:53:50.463
[Terrance] Well, so far, 
Michael background checks is good,

1032
00:53:50.497 --> 00:53:51.565
you know, so so far he's clean.

1033
00:53:51.631 --> 00:53:53.366
Yeah. A real clean liar.

1034
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:54.935
[Terrance] Oh, come on, Cass.

1035
00:53:54.968 --> 00:53:56.203
[sighs] Okay.

1036
00:53:56.269 --> 00:53:58.572
Uh, thank you guys so much.

1037
00:53:58.605 --> 00:54:00.674
Yes. Anything for you, sis.

1038
00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.642
Just be careful.

1039
00:54:02.676 --> 00:54:05.111
Maybe what you should
do is talk to Michael

1040
00:54:05.145 --> 00:54:08.515
and find out why he's
been lying about his daughter's name.

1041
00:54:08.548 --> 00:54:10.150
[Whitney] I will. All right.

1042
00:54:10.217 --> 00:54:11.685
Okay.

1043
00:54:11.751 --> 00:54:13.353
Let me go. Bye.

1044
00:54:14.654 --> 00:54:15.722
[sighs]

1045
00:54:24.998 --> 00:54:27.434
[phone rings]

1046
00:54:28.802 --> 00:54:30.670
Hey, baby, I miss you.

1047
00:54:30.704 --> 00:54:31.871
[Whitney] Why didn't you
even tell me that Joanna

1048
00:54:31.905 --> 00:54:33.106
is not her real name?

1049
00:54:34.274 --> 00:54:35.675
-Wait. What? 
-[Whitney] Yeah. That's right.

1050
00:54:35.709 --> 00:54:37.744
I know that her name is Maggie Dillon.

1051
00:54:37.777 --> 00:54:39.312
Who told you that?

1052
00:54:39.346 --> 00:54:41.414
Cass asked Terrance to check her out.

1053
00:54:41.481 --> 00:54:43.049
[Michael] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

1054
00:54:43.083 --> 00:54:45.018
You had your sister's cop husband

1055
00:54:45.085 --> 00:54:46.519
do a background check on my daughter?

1056
00:54:46.553 --> 00:54:48.088
[Whitney] Yeah. That's right.

1057
00:54:48.121 --> 00:54:50.056
Things are off, Michael.

1058
00:54:50.123 --> 00:54:51.758
She changed her name for a reason,

1059
00:54:51.825 --> 00:54:54.327
and you're sitting here
lying to me and covering.

1060
00:54:54.394 --> 00:54:55.996
Well, I need answers.

1061
00:54:56.029 --> 00:54:57.664
[Michael] Baby, baby, baby, calm down.

1062
00:54:57.697 --> 00:54:58.798
Okay? I'm sorry.

1063
00:54:58.865 --> 00:55:00.600
Don't tell me to calm down.

1064
00:55:00.634 --> 00:55:01.835
Okay. You're right.

1065
00:55:03.436 --> 00:55:05.872
Yes. Joanna did get her name changed. Okay?

1066
00:55:05.939 --> 00:55:09.276
But it wasn't me, it was her grandparents.

1067
00:55:09.342 --> 00:55:11.111
Listen to me. You gotta understand.

1068
00:55:11.144 --> 00:55:14.914
This is...this was around the
time when I was getting drunk.

1069
00:55:16.216 --> 00:55:18.385
Then I started dating this woman.

1070
00:55:19.686 --> 00:55:21.621
Her name was Heather.

1071
00:55:21.655 --> 00:55:25.292
You know, I thought it
was going to fix things,

1072
00:55:26.092 --> 00:55:27.761
but it only made it worse.

1073
00:55:29.796 --> 00:55:33.600
Heather was abusing Joanna, Whitney,

1074
00:55:33.667 --> 00:55:35.669
mentally, physically.

1075
00:55:38.438 --> 00:55:41.474
And when Joanna told me, 
I didn't even believe her.

1076
00:55:41.541 --> 00:55:43.143
I didn't believe my baby.

1077
00:55:45.078 --> 00:55:47.147
Not until I called Heather myself.

1078
00:55:49.516 --> 00:55:52.085
And that's when they
took Joanna away from me.

1079
00:55:53.053 --> 00:55:54.621
Heather went to jail...

1080
00:55:56.523 --> 00:55:58.658
and Joanna went to live with her grandparents.

1081
00:56:00.794 --> 00:56:03.263
And I was all alone again.

1082
00:56:06.833 --> 00:56:08.335
So when Heather got out,

1083
00:56:08.401 --> 00:56:11.071
her grandparents thought that as a safety precaution,

1084
00:56:11.137 --> 00:56:14.407
it would be better if
Joanna got her name changed.

1085
00:56:15.408 --> 00:56:18.611
And, yeah, I didn't tell you

1086
00:56:18.678 --> 00:56:22.515
because I figured that it
wasn't my business to tell you.

1087
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:25.151
I figured Joanna would tell you

1088
00:56:25.218 --> 00:56:28.154
whenever she felt comfortable enough with you.

1089
00:56:28.188 --> 00:56:31.891
But now, I don't even think that's possible.

1090
00:56:31.958 --> 00:56:34.260
Are you saying it's my fault

1091
00:56:34.327 --> 00:56:36.062
that she doesn't feel comfortable?

1092
00:56:36.096 --> 00:56:39.265
No. No. No. No. Baby, no.

1093
00:56:39.332 --> 00:56:41.067
Listen, okay?

1094
00:56:43.103 --> 00:56:45.405
Joanna's been through a lot.

1095
00:56:45.438 --> 00:56:48.341
All right? And if you're
saying that she's acting out,

1096
00:56:48.408 --> 00:56:50.276
she has trust issues.

1097
00:56:50.343 --> 00:56:53.847
And all I'm telling you
is that if she's acting out,

1098
00:56:53.913 --> 00:56:56.883
it's probably because she's been triggered, you know?

1099
00:56:56.916 --> 00:57:00.186
Now, I feel like a complete jerk.

1100
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.454
No, no, no.

1101
00:57:01.521 --> 00:57:03.523
Listen, baby, it's not your fault.

1102
00:57:03.590 --> 00:57:05.725
Like I said, I should have told you.

1103
00:57:05.759 --> 00:57:09.195
Yeah, you should have told me a lot

1104
00:57:09.229 --> 00:57:11.498
before we adopted your daughter.

1105
00:57:11.531 --> 00:57:13.032
[Michael] What's that supposed to mean?

1106
00:57:13.533 --> 00:57:17.904
It means that there's been
a series of strange occurrences.

1107
00:57:17.971 --> 00:57:20.440
My mother's urn, my presentation,

1108
00:57:20.473 --> 00:57:22.842
the chemist calls and tells me
that there's lye in my samples.

1109
00:57:22.876 --> 00:57:24.577
Lye, Michael.

1110
00:57:24.611 --> 00:57:26.012
How does something like that get in there?

1111
00:57:26.079 --> 00:57:28.381
Whitney, whoa, whoa. Calm down.

1112
00:57:28.415 --> 00:57:31.117
Listen to yourself. 
You're not even making sense.

1113
00:57:31.151 --> 00:57:33.920
What reason would Joanna have
to do all this to you?

1114
00:57:33.987 --> 00:57:35.622
I don't know.

1115
00:57:35.688 --> 00:57:37.290
It doesn't mean that she didn't.

1116
00:57:37.323 --> 00:57:38.992
It don't mean that she did either.

1117
00:57:39.025 --> 00:57:42.495
You just said that she
could be acting out and triggered.

1118
00:57:42.562 --> 00:57:44.597
I'm not doing this with you.

1119
00:57:44.664 --> 00:57:47.700
Listen to me. I love you, all right?

1120
00:57:47.767 --> 00:57:49.903
But I love my daughter too.

1121
00:57:49.969 --> 00:57:53.473
Can we just try to
work this out as a family?

1122
00:57:53.506 --> 00:57:55.074
We already got people talking

1123
00:57:55.141 --> 00:57:56.743
about we got married too quickly.

1124
00:57:56.776 --> 00:57:58.511
And I know it messed
things up when Joanna popped up.

1125
00:57:58.578 --> 00:58:02.315
But I love you, and I
need you to have my back.

1126
00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:05.885
We can get through this.

1127
00:58:05.952 --> 00:58:08.288
We can make this work. 
We are making this work.

1128
00:58:08.354 --> 00:58:11.925
I just...I need you
to be honest with me.

1129
00:58:11.991 --> 00:58:13.426
No more keeping secrets.

1130
00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:15.361
[Michael] Yeah. Yeah.

1131
00:58:15.428 --> 00:58:16.830
No more secrets,

1132
00:58:16.863 --> 00:58:19.032
I promise.

1133
00:58:19.065 --> 00:58:20.700
Okay.

1134
00:58:22.268 --> 00:58:24.037
I love you.

1135
00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:25.672
And I know how important it is

1136
00:58:25.738 --> 00:58:28.174
for Joanna to have a
mother figure. I get it.

1137
00:58:29.108 --> 00:58:32.645
And I'll do my best
to be that for her.

1138
00:58:32.679 --> 00:58:34.581
I love you too, baby.

1139
00:58:34.647 --> 00:58:35.715
Thank you.

1140
00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.490
[suspenseful music]

1141
00:58:53.233 --> 00:58:55.902
[Joanna] Brian, Eric, come on. Let's go.

1142
00:58:57.403 --> 00:58:58.471
Hurry.

-[Joanna] To the movies.

00:59:01.641 --> 00:59:04.010
[Whitney] You didn't run it by me first.

1145
00:59:04.077 --> 00:59:05.745
[Joanna] Uh, I asked my dad.

1146
00:59:05.812 --> 00:59:07.580
And he said it was fine.

1147
00:59:07.614 --> 00:59:10.316
I took the boys to the park
last week and there wasn't an issue.

1148
00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:11.751
Well, I don't think it's a good idea

1149
00:59:11.818 --> 00:59:13.052
for them to go anywhere with you

1150
00:59:13.086 --> 00:59:14.621
without your father or me present.

1151
00:59:14.654 --> 00:59:15.722
Why?

1152
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:19.259
What do you think, they're
unsafe with me or something?

1153
00:59:19.292 --> 00:59:20.493
I didn't say that.

1154
00:59:21.528 --> 00:59:23.263
Listen, Whitney,

1155
00:59:23.296 --> 00:59:25.798
I think that's a little
bit hypocritical coming from you,

1156
00:59:25.832 --> 00:59:29.969
Mrs. Almost-hurt-herself- sleepwalking.

1157
00:59:30.003 --> 00:59:31.571
Maybe too much pill popping you're doing.

1158
00:59:32.572 --> 00:59:35.141
You better watch your
slick ass mouth, little girl.

1159
00:59:35.208 --> 00:59:37.377
Yeah, or what? 
Are you gonna hit me?

1160
00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:39.712
Yeah. I wonder what my
dad would feel about that.

1161
00:59:39.746 --> 00:59:42.015
No. I'm not gonna hit you,

1162
00:59:42.048 --> 00:59:43.750
but I'm sure your
dad would love to hear

1163
00:59:43.816 --> 00:59:45.451
about this little discussion.

1164
00:59:45.485 --> 00:59:47.353
So let's just wait until he comes back

1165
00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:49.689
to have this conversation, Maggie.

1166
00:59:49.722 --> 00:59:51.658
What did you just say?

1167
00:59:51.724 --> 00:59:53.126
Keep playing with me.

1168
00:59:53.159 --> 00:59:55.128
It's gonna be trouble for you, little girl.

1169
00:59:55.194 --> 00:59:56.863
[Brian] Hey, what's going on?

1170
00:59:56.930 --> 00:59:58.331
Oh, Joanna was just telling me

1171
00:59:58.364 --> 00:59:59.999
that she can't take
you two to the movies.

1172
01:00:00.033 --> 01:00:01.801
So I'm gonna be taking you guys.

1173
01:00:01.868 --> 01:00:03.269
She has other plans. Come on.

1174
01:00:03.303 --> 01:00:05.238
-Wait, what? 
-Let's get in the car.

1175
01:00:06.506 --> 01:00:07.840
[Brian] Are you okay?

1176
01:00:07.907 --> 01:00:09.976
Yeah, I'm fine.

1177
01:00:11.544 --> 01:00:14.180
[suspenseful music]

1178
01:00:26.459 --> 01:00:28.061
-[Brian] Hey. 
-[Joanna] Hey.

1179
01:00:28.094 --> 01:00:29.462
Can I come in?

1180
01:00:29.495 --> 01:00:31.364
Yeah, come in.

1181
01:00:33.499 --> 01:00:35.101
[Joanna] So your mom kind of swung

1182
01:00:35.134 --> 01:00:37.403
left on me this morning.

1183
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:41.140
[Brian] Oh, I knew something, something happened.

1184
01:00:42.508 --> 01:00:44.644
So I was thinking I'm
gonna find a place to stay

1185
01:00:44.711 --> 01:00:45.912
for the next couple of days

1186
01:00:45.945 --> 01:00:47.914
while my dad's still out of town.

1187
01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:49.882
I really don't wanna cause any more trouble,

1188
01:00:49.916 --> 01:00:52.218
especially after what happened with the urn.

1189
01:00:52.285 --> 01:00:55.221
The urn? You... that was an accident.

1190
01:00:55.254 --> 01:00:57.523
[Joanna] Yeah. But still,

1191
01:00:57.590 --> 01:00:59.859
I really should have just
told your mom right away

1192
01:00:59.892 --> 01:01:02.962
that I dropped it accidentally.

1193
01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:04.397
[Brian] Joanna, you shouldn't have to stay

1194
01:01:04.464 --> 01:01:06.566
anywhere else, you know.

1195
01:01:06.599 --> 01:01:10.236
So, um, hell, I'll talk to her.

1196
01:01:10.303 --> 01:01:12.338
I'll get her to chill or something.

1197
01:01:12.405 --> 01:01:14.140
[Joanna] Really?

1198
01:01:14.173 --> 01:01:16.042
Yeah. Yeah.

1199
01:01:16.075 --> 01:01:18.277
Thank you.

1200
01:01:18.311 --> 01:01:19.846
[Brian] You're welcome.

1201
01:01:19.912 --> 01:01:21.447
I appreciate it.

1202
01:01:21.514 --> 01:01:23.282
[Brian] Of course.

1203
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:24.817
And, uh,

1204
01:01:26.653 --> 01:01:28.321
you look--you look real pretty by the way.

1205
01:01:31.991 --> 01:01:33.059
Thank you.

1206
01:02:29.482 --> 01:02:30.616
Son?

1207
01:02:31.918 --> 01:02:36.422
[sighs] You know you can tell
me anything no matter what it is.

1208
01:02:36.456 --> 01:02:38.891
You can tell me and
you won't get in trouble, right?

1209
01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:40.126
Yeah.

1210
01:02:40.193 --> 01:02:41.494
I know, Mom.

1211
01:02:41.561 --> 01:02:43.229
Everything's cool.

1212
01:02:43.296 --> 01:02:46.065
-[Whitney] [sighs] Okay. 
-Are you all right?

1213
01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:47.600
You look tired.

1214
01:02:47.633 --> 01:02:49.702
My sweet boy.

1215
01:02:49.736 --> 01:02:51.871
I'm okay. Mommy's okay.

1216
01:02:51.904 --> 01:02:55.575
Uh, lights out, all right? I love you.

1217
01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:57.577
-[Eric] Love you too. 
-Goodnight.

1218
01:03:00.379 --> 01:03:03.850
Yeah. I'm
-I'm a rizz guy. I'm, like...

1219
01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:05.518
I mean, if you
wanted to talk to me,

1220
01:03:05.585 --> 01:03:06.686
you could've just said that.

1221
01:03:06.719 --> 01:03:07.787
I mean, there's no problem.

1222
01:03:09.489 --> 01:03:12.024
-Yeah. 
-[Whitney] Hmm. Son.

1223
01:03:12.058 --> 01:03:13.960
One second. Yeah?

1224
01:03:14.026 --> 01:03:15.595
[Whitney] I'm waking you up at 6:30

1225
01:03:15.628 --> 01:03:16.996
whether you get sleep or not,

1226
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:19.732
so I suggest you get off that phone,

1227
01:03:19.766 --> 01:03:21.734
turn these lights out.

1228
01:03:21.801 --> 01:03:23.202
[Brian] I know.

1229
01:03:23.236 --> 01:03:24.704
Are you okay?

1230
01:03:26.305 --> 01:03:28.007
Yes, baby.

1231
01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.909
All right.

1232
01:03:29.942 --> 01:03:32.612
Look like you're the
one who needs sleep, so...

1233
01:03:32.645 --> 01:03:35.648
Get the posters off the
wall. Come on. Go to bed.

1234
01:03:35.715 --> 01:03:37.283
[Brian] Poster?

1235
01:03:42.421 --> 01:03:45.458
[suspenseful music]

1236
01:04:01.073 --> 01:04:04.010
[panting]

1237
01:04:20.059 --> 01:04:21.194
[Joanna] Hey.

1238
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:25.031
Hey.

1239
01:04:27.967 --> 01:04:29.168
What's up?

1240
01:04:32.538 --> 01:04:36.542
Um, I was wondering
if you got the chance

1241
01:04:36.576 --> 01:04:38.411
to talk to your mom yet.

1242
01:04:40.646 --> 01:04:44.617
Uh, no, actually, I haven't. Not yet.

1243
01:04:46.152 --> 01:04:47.753
-Oh. 
-Yeah.

1244
01:04:47.787 --> 01:04:49.822
Well, yeah.

1245
01:04:49.889 --> 01:04:51.724
That's okay.

1246
01:04:51.791 --> 01:04:53.459
Whenever you get the chance.

1247
01:04:55.094 --> 01:04:56.662
Uh, yeah.

1248
01:05:01.968 --> 01:05:04.570
I can-
-I can do it now actually.

1249
01:05:04.604 --> 01:05:06.038
Really?

1250
01:05:06.105 --> 01:05:08.274
Yeah.

1251
01:05:08.341 --> 01:05:10.243
That would be really great.

1252
01:05:10.276 --> 01:05:12.478
My dad will still be out
of town for a couple more days

1253
01:05:12.511 --> 01:05:14.513
and I really don't want
things to be as awkward

1254
01:05:14.547 --> 01:05:16.449
as they were tonight at dinner.

1255
01:05:16.482 --> 01:05:18.050
Yeah.

1256
01:05:18.117 --> 01:05:19.619
Thanks, BK.

1257
01:05:22.455 --> 01:05:23.689
It's no big problem.

1258
01:05:23.723 --> 01:05:25.057
It's, um...

1259
01:05:25.091 --> 01:05:27.059
it's cool.

1260
01:05:27.093 --> 01:05:29.662
And you're a really good guy.

1261
01:05:29.695 --> 01:05:31.597
-You know that? 
-Thank you.

1262
01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:35.902
[clears throat]

1263
01:05:39.705 --> 01:05:40.907
We, um...

1264
01:05:40.973 --> 01:05:42.575
it's what family is for.

1265
01:05:42.608 --> 01:05:44.010
Right.

1266
01:05:46.212 --> 01:05:47.747
Well, let me know how it goes.

1267
01:05:49.649 --> 01:05:51.017
Okay.

1268
01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.521
Be right back.

1269
01:06:04.964 --> 01:06:07.733
Hey, Mom? Um...

1270
01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:12.371
I
-I
-I just really wanted to talk to you about Joanna.

1271
01:06:13.506 --> 01:06:16.809
Um, I just think you're overreacting.

1272
01:06:16.842 --> 01:06:18.477
I really do.

1273
01:06:18.511 --> 01:06:21.347
Like at dinner, we--you can hear me, right?

1274
01:06:22.915 --> 01:06:24.150
Mom?

1275
01:06:25.351 --> 01:06:26.485
Are you sleeping?

1276
01:06:28.921 --> 01:06:31.958
Mom? Mom? Mom?

1277
01:06:32.024 --> 01:06:34.994
Mom? Mom? Oh, my God. Oh my God.

1278
01:06:35.027 --> 01:06:37.897
Oh, my God. Mom? Mom? Mom.

1279
01:06:37.930 --> 01:06:41.033
Joanna! Joanna, come here now! Joanna!

1280
01:06:41.067 --> 01:06:43.102
-What's wrong? 
-[Brian] Hurry! Hurry up!

1281
01:06:44.403 --> 01:06:45.738
-Joanna! 
-[Joanna] Yeah?

1282
01:06:45.805 --> 01:06:47.273
[Brian] Joanna, hurry up! Hurry up!

1283
01:06:47.306 --> 01:06:48.641
-What's wrong? 
-[Brian] Hurry up!

1284
01:06:48.708 --> 01:06:49.909
-[gasps] 
-[Brian] Oh, my God.

1285
01:06:49.976 --> 01:06:51.744
Give me--give me a towel. 
Give me a towel.

1286
01:06:51.811 --> 01:06:53.379
-[Joanna] What happened to her? 
-Wake up. Wake up.

1287
01:06:53.412 --> 01:06:55.982
-She's asleep. I don't know. 
-[Joanna] Oh, my God.

1288
01:06:56.015 --> 01:06:58.250
[Brian] Give me a towel. 
Go get me a towel.

1289
01:06:58.284 --> 01:07:01.287
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. 
-Mom!

1290
01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:02.355
Oh, no. Don't let Eric see this.

1291
01:07:02.388 --> 01:07:03.589
-[Eric] Mom! 
-Yes, yes. Okay.

1292
01:07:03.656 --> 01:07:04.423
She... uh, there's still a pulse.

1293
01:07:04.457 --> 01:07:05.524
Call 911.

1294
01:07:08.627 --> 01:07:09.762
[cop] And you're sure she's never done

1295
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:10.963
anything like this before?

1296
01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:12.999
No. No.

1297
01:07:13.065 --> 01:07:15.001
I mean, she-she suffered from depression before

1298
01:07:15.034 --> 01:07:19.105
but she's never tried
to commit suicide, you know?

1299
01:07:19.138 --> 01:07:20.406
[cop] Okay.

1300
01:07:20.473 --> 01:07:22.475
That's all I need.

1301
01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:26.212
Officer, when can Whitney be released?

1302
01:07:26.245 --> 01:07:28.681
[cop] Typical standard procedure
in a case like this

1303
01:07:28.748 --> 01:07:30.383
is over 72 hours.

1304
01:07:32.018 --> 01:07:34.353
You guys have someone
coming to pick you up?

1305
01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:35.988
Oh, yes.

1306
01:07:37.156 --> 01:07:38.891
[Cassandra] Poor baby. 
How's your mom?

1307
01:07:38.924 --> 01:07:41.227
-Where is she? 
-I don't know.

1308
01:07:41.293 --> 01:07:42.728
[elevator dings]

1309
01:07:42.795 --> 01:07:44.263
I take it you're...

1310
01:07:44.296 --> 01:07:45.464
I'm Cassandra.

1311
01:07:45.498 --> 01:07:47.433
I'm their mother's sister.

1312
01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.769
Well, good news. She's fine.

1313
01:07:49.802 --> 01:07:51.470
Stable condition.

1314
01:07:51.504 --> 01:07:53.939
But the bad news is we're
gonna have to keep her here

1315
01:07:54.006 --> 01:07:56.242
a few more days just as a precaution,

1316
01:07:56.275 --> 01:07:58.077
just to take further tests.

1317
01:07:58.144 --> 01:07:59.578
But she's okay though, right?

1318
01:07:59.612 --> 01:08:01.280
[doctor] Yes.

1319
01:08:01.313 --> 01:08:03.849
I understand. Can we see her?

1320
01:08:03.883 --> 01:08:06.318
Actually, she would like to only speak

1321
01:08:06.385 --> 01:08:08.187
to you just for the moment.

1322
01:08:08.254 --> 01:08:10.056
But I wanna see my mom!

1323
01:08:10.089 --> 01:08:11.957
We should all be able
to see our--see our mom.

1324
01:08:11.991 --> 01:08:13.893
It's okay. It's all right. It's fine.

1325
01:08:13.959 --> 01:08:15.795
Just stay with your brother, okay?

1326
01:08:15.861 --> 01:08:17.096
Stay with your brother. Do you mind?

1327
01:08:17.129 --> 01:08:18.431
-Anything you need. 
-Okay.

1328
01:08:18.464 --> 01:08:20.099
-Yeah. 
-Where is she?

1329
01:08:25.004 --> 01:08:27.440
Cass. You have to
get me out of here.

1330
01:08:27.506 --> 01:08:30.176
I didn't do it. 
You have to believe me.

1331
01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:31.677
Honey, look at you.

1332
01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:32.878
[Whitney] I don't know what happened.

1333
01:08:32.912 --> 01:08:35.648
I was in my bathroom

1334
01:08:35.681 --> 01:08:38.317
taking my medicine and now I'm here.

1335
01:08:38.384 --> 01:08:39.685
What...

1336
01:08:39.752 --> 01:08:41.053
they think you tried to commit suicide.

1337
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.955
No, I didn't. I...

1338
01:08:45.157 --> 01:08:46.692
do you think it could've been Joanna?

1339
01:08:46.759 --> 01:08:49.228
You think Joanna tried to kill you?

1340
01:08:49.261 --> 01:08:53.265
I don't-
-I don't know.

1341
01:08:53.332 --> 01:08:54.967
It doesn't make any sense.

1342
01:08:57.336 --> 01:08:59.171
God. And my boys.

1343
01:08:59.205 --> 01:09:00.639
Oh, my God. My boys are out there.

1344
01:09:00.706 --> 01:09:03.075
I cannot let them see me like this.

1345
01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:06.078
[sighs]

1346
01:09:09.248 --> 01:09:12.017
They're not gonna let me leave.

1347
01:09:12.051 --> 01:09:14.420
So will you please
take the boys with you

1348
01:09:14.453 --> 01:09:15.721
until I can get out of here?

1349
01:09:15.788 --> 01:09:17.957
Yes. Of course.

1350
01:09:20.559 --> 01:09:22.928
Do not let them near my stepdaughter.

1351
01:09:22.995 --> 01:09:26.432
I don't know if she
is trying to hurt them

1352
01:09:26.465 --> 01:09:28.734
-or you or something. 
-Don't worry.

1353
01:09:28.767 --> 01:09:31.604
Don't worry. The boys
will be fine with us.

1354
01:09:31.637 --> 01:09:33.672
But if you think
this little girl is capable

1355
01:09:33.706 --> 01:09:37.376
of something like this, then
she needs to be locked up.

1356
01:09:37.443 --> 01:09:39.712
What does Michael think about all this?

1357
01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:44.783
I haven't told him yet.

1358
01:09:46.785 --> 01:09:49.889
I don't wanna worry him
until I know for sure.

1359
01:09:51.557 --> 01:09:52.858
Okay.

1360
01:09:54.093 --> 01:09:56.295
You need to get some rest.

1361
01:09:56.362 --> 01:09:58.631
Come here. Come here.

1362
01:09:58.664 --> 01:10:01.066
It's okay. It's okay.

1363
01:10:01.133 --> 01:10:02.801
I've got you.

1364
01:10:02.868 --> 01:10:04.303
I've got you.

1365
01:10:04.336 --> 01:10:05.738
[Whitney] Thank you.

1366
01:10:14.246 --> 01:10:16.148
Can we see her? 
We can see her?

1367
01:10:16.182 --> 01:10:18.918
No. No. Not right now.

1368
01:10:18.951 --> 01:10:20.686
No. She needs to rest.

1369
01:10:20.753 --> 01:10:22.588
But she wants you guys
to come home with us

1370
01:10:22.655 --> 01:10:24.523
until she feels better, okay?

1371
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:26.358
I just wanna see her.

1372
01:10:26.425 --> 01:10:27.860
We should be able to see our mom.

1373
01:10:27.893 --> 01:10:30.596
I know, buddy. 
And she wants to see you too.

1374
01:10:30.629 --> 01:10:32.331
But she just needs to rest, all right?

1375
01:10:32.364 --> 01:10:35.301
And I promise you'll see her soon.

1376
01:10:35.367 --> 01:10:38.137
Until then, you guys are
gonna come home with me

1377
01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:40.406
and Uncle Terrance, okay?

1378
01:10:40.439 --> 01:10:43.142
So is this just a family affair

1379
01:10:43.175 --> 01:10:45.044
or is everything invited to the sleepover?

1380
01:10:45.077 --> 01:10:46.512
Oh, Joanna, of course you are.

1381
01:10:46.579 --> 01:10:49.848
Actually, she just mentioned Brian and Eric.

1382
01:10:49.882 --> 01:10:52.685
What are you talking about? 
That's not fair. She's family.

1383
01:10:52.751 --> 01:10:54.853
Honey, do you mind
taking them to the car?

1384
01:10:54.887 --> 01:10:56.789
No [indistinct]

1385
01:10:58.557 --> 01:10:59.792
You just call me.

1386
01:10:59.825 --> 01:11:00.993
-Yes. 
-Okay.

1387
01:11:01.026 --> 01:11:02.828
-Thank you. 
-Welcome.

1388
01:11:02.895 --> 01:11:03.963
See you.

1389
01:11:08.767 --> 01:11:10.803
I suppose, Joanna,

1390
01:11:10.836 --> 01:11:13.038
you're old enough to take care of yourself

1391
01:11:13.072 --> 01:11:15.474
at the house while
Whitney is in the hospital.

1392
01:11:15.507 --> 01:11:17.009
You're right.

1393
01:11:17.042 --> 01:11:19.745
I can take care of myself.

1394
01:11:19.778 --> 01:11:21.547
-Okay. 
-I'll be at home.

1395
01:11:25.651 --> 01:11:28.721
[suspenseful music]

1396
01:13:09.321 --> 01:13:10.556
[doctor] Good morning, Mrs. Lawrence.

1397
01:13:10.589 --> 01:13:12.925
I hope you were
able to get some rest.

1398
01:13:12.958 --> 01:13:16.261
Would you be able to if
you were accused of being crazy,

1399
01:13:16.328 --> 01:13:18.163
tried to kill yourself?

1400
01:13:18.230 --> 01:13:20.499
[doctor] Okay. 
Well, about that, seeing the state

1401
01:13:20.532 --> 01:13:22.134
you were in last we spoke,

1402
01:13:22.201 --> 01:13:24.336
I put a rush on your toxicology report

1403
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:27.606
and well, I just got
the results in this morning.

1404
01:13:27.673 --> 01:13:29.675
And I have to admit,

1405
01:13:29.742 --> 01:13:33.112
I mean, it looked very
troubling to say the least.

1406
01:13:34.146 --> 01:13:38.650
Now, a woman of your standing,

1407
01:13:38.684 --> 01:13:41.120
I shouldn't have to remind you, Mrs. Lawrence,

1408
01:13:41.153 --> 01:13:44.790
that mixing recreational drugs and antidepressants

1409
01:13:44.857 --> 01:13:47.192
is a very dangerous game.

1410
01:13:47.259 --> 01:13:50.095
I don't-- what are you talking about?

1411
01:13:50.162 --> 01:13:52.064
Look, everything is right here

1412
01:13:52.097 --> 01:13:54.066
in black and white, Mrs. Lawrence.

1413
01:13:54.133 --> 01:13:55.734
I don't know what you're talking about.

1414
01:13:55.801 --> 01:13:59.171
I've never done drugs in my life.

1415
01:13:59.238 --> 01:14:02.107
Then how do you explain us finding cocaine,

1416
01:14:02.174 --> 01:14:05.144
Diphenhydramine, and Temazepam in your system,

1417
01:14:05.177 --> 01:14:07.546
along with your prescribed medication?

1418
01:14:07.579 --> 01:14:12.351
I mean, that combination is
beyond a recipe of disaster.

1419
01:14:12.384 --> 01:14:14.753
And it's very likely
that mixing those drugs together,

1420
01:14:14.787 --> 01:14:16.555
you could've been in
an alternate state of mind

1421
01:14:16.622 --> 01:14:19.258
and then inadvertently attempted suicide.

1422
01:14:19.291 --> 01:14:22.594
No. No, I'm telling you. I've never-
-I've never--

1423
01:14:22.661 --> 01:14:24.296
[doctor] Either way, Mrs. Lawrence,

1424
01:14:24.363 --> 01:14:26.799
the police are here and they
would like to have a word.

1425
01:14:28.867 --> 01:14:30.302
[cop] Ms. Lawrence,

1426
01:14:30.369 --> 01:14:31.970
I wanna start by
saying you're not under arrest,

1427
01:14:32.004 --> 01:14:34.006
but your case has been
passed on to Social Services.

1428
01:14:35.374 --> 01:14:36.608
What?

1429
01:14:36.642 --> 01:14:39.178
No, no, this is--no, no.

1430
01:14:39.211 --> 01:14:41.613
I-
-I'm a damn good mother.

1431
01:14:41.647 --> 01:14:44.216
No. I need my phone!

1432
01:14:44.249 --> 01:14:46.485
Give me my phone! 
You can call my husband!

1433
01:14:46.552 --> 01:14:50.088
This is--this is--this is--
this is my stepdaughter's doing!

1434
01:14:50.155 --> 01:14:52.658
Yeah, she said that you might say that.

1435
01:14:52.724 --> 01:14:54.326
Oh, my God.

1436
01:14:54.359 --> 01:14:55.794
[cop] Now, I need you to tell me

1437
01:14:55.861 --> 01:14:57.296
about an incident that
happened a few weeks ago

1438
01:14:57.329 --> 01:14:59.331
when you were sleepwalking in your backyard.

1439
01:14:59.364 --> 01:15:01.567
What?

1440
01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.836
[newscaster] I'm reporting to
you live from Orange County,

1441
01:15:03.902 --> 01:15:06.205
where this afternoon, the body of missing teen,

1442
01:15:06.238 --> 01:15:09.107
Dante Owen has been recently discovered

1443
01:15:09.141 --> 01:15:10.509
-in a local park... 
-No.

1444
01:15:10.542 --> 01:15:11.844
[newscaster] ...where he tragically fell

1445
01:15:11.877 --> 01:15:13.679
from the James Davis Bridge.

1446
01:15:13.745 --> 01:15:14.780
For more on this,

1447
01:15:14.813 --> 01:15:16.148
-tune in tonight... 
-No.

1448
01:15:16.181 --> 01:15:17.182
[newscaster] ...on the 10 o'clock news.

1449
01:15:17.216 --> 01:15:20.285
This is crazy. [sobs]

1450
01:15:22.521 --> 01:15:24.223
Wait, what?

1451
01:15:24.256 --> 01:15:25.824
What's crazy? What?

1452
01:15:25.858 --> 01:15:29.394
That's the same park that Joanna
took us to the other day.

1453
01:15:29.428 --> 01:15:33.966
Then she disappeared for, like,
15 minutes and then, came back.

1454
01:15:35.133 --> 01:15:36.335
No.

1455
01:15:39.571 --> 01:15:42.541
Do you think she did this to Dante?

1456
01:15:42.608 --> 01:15:44.343
No.

1457
01:15:44.376 --> 01:15:45.944
No, no.

1458
01:15:45.978 --> 01:15:49.448
I mean, the last time Dante
was seen was at our house.

1459
01:15:49.515 --> 01:15:50.749
[sobs]

Hell, no.

1462
01:15:56.788 --> 01:15:58.657
Oh, hell. I'm calling Joanna.

1463
01:15:58.690 --> 01:16:00.225
It--it's just--calm down.

1464
01:16:00.292 --> 01:16:01.927
-I'm calling Joanna. 
-Just calm down, all right?

1465
01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:04.196
There is no need call anyone right now.

1466
01:16:04.263 --> 01:16:05.764
Why?

1467
01:16:05.831 --> 01:16:07.032
You know what...

1468
01:16:08.133 --> 01:16:11.703
Auntie, that was our best friend Dante.

1469
01:16:11.737 --> 01:16:13.138
Baby.

[dramatic music]

01:16:30.656 --> 01:16:32.357
Look, babe, I hear you.

1472
01:16:32.391 --> 01:16:34.026
And trust me, I think weird things

1473
01:16:34.059 --> 01:16:35.994
have been happening since she's been here

1474
01:16:36.061 --> 01:16:38.597
but it's nothing to bring
her in on for questioning.

1475
01:16:38.664 --> 01:16:40.666
Then figure something out.

1476
01:16:40.732 --> 01:16:43.068
[Michael] Baby, even if I did,
you know I can't do that

1477
01:16:43.135 --> 01:16:45.604
without her legal parent or guardian present.

1478
01:16:46.672 --> 01:16:49.241
And with Michael out of town
and your sister in the hospital,

1479
01:16:49.308 --> 01:16:50.943
my hands are tied
for the time being, baby.

1480
01:16:51.009 --> 01:16:53.512
Oh, God, Whitney.

1481
01:16:53.579 --> 01:16:55.147
I gotta let her know.

1482
01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:58.350
Babe, can you send
me over all the information

1483
01:16:58.417 --> 01:17:00.319
you have on Joanna.

1484
01:17:00.352 --> 01:17:01.787
Sure. But it's not much.

[siren wailing]

1488
01:17:14.933 --> 01:17:16.702
They said they're gonna take the kids away.

1489
01:17:16.768 --> 01:17:17.836
No.

1490
01:17:17.869 --> 01:17:19.237
They said they're gonna take them.

1491
01:17:19.271 --> 01:17:21.206
No, you know we
will not let that happen.

1492
01:17:21.273 --> 01:17:22.674
I brought you a change of clothes

1493
01:17:22.708 --> 01:17:23.875
for when it's time
for you to be released.

1494
01:17:23.909 --> 01:17:25.777
I still have 48 hours in here.

1495
01:17:25.811 --> 01:17:28.080
The doctor came in here and
he told me that they found

1496
01:17:28.146 --> 01:17:30.949
drugs and cocaine, and all
that stuff in my system.

1497
01:17:30.983 --> 01:17:32.618
And I swear...you know, you
know me and I swear.

1498
01:17:32.651 --> 01:17:34.119
I know. I know,
honey, I know. I know.

1499
01:17:34.186 --> 01:17:35.387
I...

1500
01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:36.788
I need you to listen to me, okay?

1501
01:17:36.822 --> 01:17:40.192
-Okay. 
-They found Dante dead.

1502
01:17:40.225 --> 01:17:41.426
What?

1503
01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:42.828
They found this body this morning

1504
01:17:42.894 --> 01:17:44.162
at the Hammel's Creek

1505
01:17:44.196 --> 01:17:45.230
beneath the old James Davis Bridge.

1506
01:17:45.263 --> 01:17:46.632
Oh, my God.

1507
01:17:46.698 --> 01:17:48.700
Cops are thinking it was an accidental fall,

1508
01:17:48.767 --> 01:17:51.737
but I overheard the boys talking.

1509
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:54.473
Dante was last seen at your house

1510
01:17:54.506 --> 01:17:56.108
-before he went missing. 
-Oh, my God, no.

1511
01:17:56.174 --> 01:17:59.144
And Joanna, she took the
boys to the same park.

1512
01:17:59.177 --> 01:18:01.046
Now, Eric said that she disappeared

1513
01:18:01.079 --> 01:18:02.981
for 15 minutes before she came back.

1514
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:05.651
What?

1515
01:18:05.684 --> 01:18:08.286
It's my opinion that
she may have killed him.

1516
01:18:08.353 --> 01:18:10.622
No. No way.

1517
01:18:10.656 --> 01:18:12.357
Have you--have you told anyone?

1518
01:18:12.391 --> 01:18:13.959
Well, the cops can't question her

1519
01:18:14.026 --> 01:18:15.827
until either you get out of here

1520
01:18:15.861 --> 01:18:17.229
or until Michael gets back.

1521
01:18:17.295 --> 01:18:19.097
Oh, my God. Michael.

1522
01:18:19.131 --> 01:18:20.799
No, Michael-
-Michael's never--

1523
01:18:20.832 --> 01:18:23.368
he's never going to agree to that.

1524
01:18:23.402 --> 01:18:25.137
[Cassandra] I think there is something else

1525
01:18:25.203 --> 01:18:27.205
you need to take a look at.

1526
01:18:27.272 --> 01:18:30.142
What is it? What
is this? Oh, my God.

1527
01:18:30.208 --> 01:18:32.511
It's Chantal Lawrence's case file.

1528
01:18:32.577 --> 01:18:34.046
Joanna's mother.

1529
01:18:34.079 --> 01:18:37.149
Now you said that she
was killed by a drunk driver,

1530
01:18:37.182 --> 01:18:38.550
but it says it right here

1531
01:18:38.617 --> 01:18:41.119
that she was the one that was inebriated.

1532
01:18:41.186 --> 01:18:43.488
She had cocaine, Temazepam,

1533
01:18:43.522 --> 01:18:46.058
diphenhydramine all in her system, too.

1534
01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:49.928
Why would Michael tell me

1535
01:18:49.995 --> 01:18:51.997
that she was killed by a drunk driver?

1536
01:18:52.064 --> 01:18:54.833
I don't know, maybe Michael was too ashamed

1537
01:18:54.866 --> 01:18:56.935
to admit that his wife was an addict.

1538
01:18:56.968 --> 01:19:00.372
But let's be real, sis, 
Michael has not been honest

1539
01:19:00.405 --> 01:19:02.941
about anything relating to his past.

1540
01:19:02.974 --> 01:19:05.777
Do you think that Joanna's responsible

1541
01:19:05.844 --> 01:19:08.146
for her mother's death?

1542
01:19:08.213 --> 01:19:10.982
At this point, I don't-
-I don't know.

1543
01:19:11.016 --> 01:19:13.385
Anything is possible.

1544
01:19:13.418 --> 01:19:16.888
I don't-
- I don't understand, Cass.

1545
01:19:16.922 --> 01:19:19.858
How did--how did she... how
could she have given me

1546
01:19:19.925 --> 01:19:23.829
all of that crap and I didn't-
-I didn't know?

1547
01:19:23.895 --> 01:19:25.163
[Cassandra] Just think.

1548
01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:26.498
-Did she--did she cook for you? 
-No.

1549
01:19:26.531 --> 01:19:28.200
Did she--did she make you a protein shake?

1550
01:19:28.233 --> 01:19:29.301
-No. 
-Come on. You gotta think.

1551
01:19:29.367 --> 01:19:30.836
Never.

1552
01:19:33.572 --> 01:19:35.173
The...my pills.

1553
01:19:36.608 --> 01:19:39.244
She saw me taking them every day.

1554
01:19:40.779 --> 01:19:43.682
Oh, my God. She
must've poisoned them or something.

1555
01:19:43.715 --> 01:19:45.250
That has to be it.

1556
01:19:45.283 --> 01:19:47.319
'Cause if she doctored your medicine,

1557

then her fingerprints are on the bottle

01:19:49.755 --> 01:19:51.156
and on the capsule.

1559
01:19:52.424 --> 01:19:55.260
If I can just
get that over to Terrance...

1560
01:19:56.795 --> 01:19:59.765
Wait. Where are you going?

1561
01:19:59.831 --> 01:20:02.400
To your house, to get your pills.

1562

And while I do that,

1563
01:20:04.136 --> 01:20:05.837
it's time for you to
call Michael and tell him

1564
01:20:05.871 --> 01:20:08.273
-what is really going on here. 
-Cass,

if she is as dangerous

1566
01:20:10.108 --> 01:20:11.910
as we say she
is, you cannot go over.

1567

You're making this so much
harder than it has to be!

1630
01:27:04.489 --> 01:27:07.192
Stop complicating things!

Was that really that hard, Whit?

01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:27.745
You're complicating things so much.

1637
01:27:27.779 --> 01:27:30.682
If only you knew how
much planning went into this,

1638
01:27:30.715 --> 01:27:34.319
maybe you would be a little
bit more respectful of my time!

1639
01:27:34.352 --> 01:27:36.754
You're a lot more difficult than my granny.

You're probably wondering what I hit you with.

1651
01:28:55.199 --> 01:28:57.568
It's a concentrated dose of Temazepam,

1652
01:28:57.635 --> 01:28:59.237
which is one of the main ingredients

1653
01:28:59.304 --> 01:29:00.605
in the little cocktail I replaced

1654
01:29:00.638 --> 01:29:02.373
some of your pills with.

1655
01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:04.409
I don't know how you
caught onto that so quickly.

01:29:04.475 --> 01:29:07.011
Hey, I'm not gonna kill you.

1657
01:29:07.078 --> 01:29:09.614
Terrance, your sister, they're still alive.

1658
01:29:09.681 --> 01:29:11.649
Just easier to manage.

1659
01:29:13.985 --> 01:29:17.655
Now we're just waiting for
the guest of honor to arrive.

1660
01:29:19.791 --> 01:29:24.962
You know, this was supposed
to be so easy, Whit.

1661
01:29:25.963 --> 01:29:28.933
A simple murder/suicide.

1662
01:29:28.966 --> 01:29:31.336
I was gonna make it look
like you took out your family,

1663
01:29:31.369 --> 01:29:34.272
you offed yourself, then you
set your house on fire.

1664
01:29:34.305 --> 01:29:36.240
The headlines would've read,

1665
01:29:36.307 --> 01:29:38.376
"Mentally insane businesswoman

1666
01:29:38.409 --> 01:29:41.679
goes crazy and murders
her family then kills herself."

1667
01:29:41.713 --> 01:29:43.715
But that's not what happened!

1668
01:29:43.748 --> 01:29:46.851
You know, it was supposed to
just be a little tragic blurb

1669
01:29:46.884 --> 01:29:49.787
in the media, maybe trended on
social media for a day or two,

1670
01:29:49.854 --> 01:29:52.857
then we would've all been able
to move on with our lives!

1671
01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:55.960
But look at the mess you created!

1672
01:29:55.993 --> 01:29:57.495
The cops are involved,

1673
01:29:57.528 --> 01:30:00.198
your brother-in-law, your sister.

My God!

1675
01:30:01.966 --> 01:30:05.870
It was supposed to be so easy!

1676
01:30:05.903 --> 01:30:07.472
But you made it so personal!

1677
01:30:07.505 --> 01:30:10.575
You see, Whit, it was never personal!

1678
01:30:10.608 --> 01:30:13.878
You were just a victim of circumstance!

Now it looks like the
guest of honor has arrived.

1688
01:30:43.875 --> 01:30:45.443
All I'm saying, 
I just wanna make sure

1689
01:30:46.577 --> 01:30:49.414
everything is at place, you know?

1690
01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.249
Well, what's wrong?

1691
01:30:51.282 --> 01:30:54.786
-Don't you trust me? 
-Come on now, baby girl.

It's just that this our biggest job ever.

1694
01:31:00.391 --> 01:31:03.027
We never had a score like this.

1695
01:31:03.094 --> 01:31:05.463
And I need to make
sure that you down to do

1696

whatever needs to be done.

1697
01:31:09.066 --> 01:31:11.502
-Like killing kids? 
-Exactly.

1698
01:31:11.536 --> 01:31:13.871
About killing the damn kids.

if you're ready to win.

Sacrifices gotta be made if you wanna win.

1704

Are you ready to sacrifice?

[tense music]

1706
01:32:17.635 --> 01:32:19.036
Hey.

1707
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:21.506
I told you this was never personal.

1708
01:32:21.572 --> 01:32:25.042
Daddy dearest have had his eyes set
on you for over a year now.

1709
01:32:25.076 --> 01:32:27.044
-[Michael] Uh-hmm. 
-[Joanna] Usually, his targets

1710
01:32:27.111 --> 01:32:29.947
were little old ladies
looking for one last thrill.

1711
01:32:30.014 --> 01:32:33.484
He'd set the op,
figure out the entire scheme,

1712
01:32:33.518 --> 01:32:36.654
and then the old
bags would mysteriously kneel over,

1713
01:32:36.721 --> 01:32:39.757
and we'd get their
inheritance or their life insurance,

1714
01:32:39.824 --> 01:32:42.093
or both, then we just move on.

1715
01:32:43.094 --> 01:32:46.130
But you were special.

1716
01:32:46.197 --> 01:32:49.033
The self-made millionaire, hey.

1717
01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:51.102
You were easy enough to steal from,

1718
01:32:51.168 --> 01:32:53.671
but also you didn't make
enough money to the point

1719
01:32:53.738 --> 01:32:56.040
where people would look at
us sideways for killing you.

1720
01:32:56.073 --> 01:32:57.441
All right, Maggie.

1721
01:32:58.809 --> 01:33:00.878
-That's enough. 
-Oh, yeah.

1722
01:33:00.945 --> 01:33:02.947
Maggie, that's my real name.

1723
01:33:03.014 --> 01:33:04.515
We had to change
it a couple years back

1724
01:33:04.582 --> 01:33:07.952
because he got his
hands a little too dirty.

1725
01:33:08.019 --> 01:33:10.521
He was worried that the
police were gonna catch on

1726
01:33:10.588 --> 01:33:13.190
to all he was doing
and start asking him questions,

1727
01:33:13.224 --> 01:33:16.093
so now I'm Joanna
but I actually was Maggie.

1728
01:33:16.127 --> 01:33:19.363
All right, yeah. 
Mag, that's enough.

1729
01:33:19.397 --> 01:33:22.099
No more time for games.

1730
01:33:22.133 --> 01:33:24.735
Where them damn boys? 
Are they here?

1731
01:33:24.769 --> 01:33:26.837
And matter of fact, why
are these two even here?

1732
01:33:26.904 --> 01:33:29.707
-Huh? 
-Like I told you on the call,

1733
01:33:29.740 --> 01:33:31.909
-there were complications. 
-No.

1734
01:33:31.943 --> 01:33:33.644
Ain't no complications.

1735
01:33:33.678 --> 01:33:36.380
The only complication is them boys.

1736
01:33:36.414 --> 01:33:39.383
Because if they still
alive, that's the problem, okay?

1737
01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:40.585
See...

1738
01:33:42.253 --> 01:33:44.522
I knew I couldn't trust your ass.

1739
01:33:44.555 --> 01:33:46.524
I shouldn't have put you in charge.

1740
01:33:46.557 --> 01:33:48.292
Now I gotta fix everything.

1741
01:33:48.326 --> 01:33:50.227
I gotta get all this plastic out.

1742
01:33:50.294 --> 01:33:51.963
-Look at this? 
-Don't you just hate it

1743
01:33:52.029 --> 01:33:53.998
when he talks to us like this?

1744
01:33:54.065 --> 01:33:56.567
Like he's talking down on
us like we're little ants

1745
01:33:56.634 --> 01:33:59.437
in his farm, like, my God.

1746
01:33:59.470 --> 01:34:01.572
Grow the hell up, Maggie.

1747
01:34:01.639 --> 01:34:04.108
Because we on a time crunch now.

1748
01:34:04.141 --> 01:34:07.912
So go ahead and call Brian
like I told you to do.

1749
01:34:07.945 --> 01:34:11.716
Tell him to come home
and bring his little bad-ass brother.

1750
01:34:11.782 --> 01:34:13.684
I'll handle the rest of this.

1751
01:34:13.718 --> 01:34:15.419
I always gotta fix everything...

1752
01:34:15.453 --> 01:34:18.222
where did you even get that gun?

1753
01:34:18.255 --> 01:34:20.424
-Huh? 
-It's right here.

1754

[tense music]

1755
01:34:25.930 --> 01:34:27.865
Good girl.

1756
01:34:27.932 --> 01:34:28.966
Give it to me.

1757
01:34:30.234 --> 01:34:31.302
Give me the gun.

1758
01:34:37.274 --> 01:34:41.412
The boys weren't the complication, daddy dearest.

1759
01:34:41.445 --> 01:34:42.747
[Michael] What?

1760
01:34:42.780 --> 01:34:44.548
This file is.

1761
01:34:44.615 --> 01:34:46.283
[Michael] What the hell is that?

1762
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:50.087
[Joanna] It's the case file from mom's accident.

1763
01:34:50.154 --> 01:34:53.658
The one you told
me she was murdered in.

1764
01:34:57.962 --> 01:34:59.196
-Hmm. 
-I don't know

1765
01:34:59.230 --> 01:35:00.264
what you're talking about, Maggie,

1766
01:35:00.331 --> 01:35:01.265
but I ain't got time for games.

1767
01:35:01.332 --> 01:35:02.867
-Give me the gun. 
-Whitney.

1768
01:35:02.933 --> 01:35:06.971
Heather, she wasn't just my dad's first girlfriend

1769
01:35:07.004 --> 01:35:08.806
after my mom died.

1770
01:35:10.141 --> 01:35:12.143
She was his first murder.

1771
01:35:12.209 --> 01:35:13.377
Hey.

1772
01:35:13.444 --> 01:35:14.512
Hey, ain't nobody got time for this.

1773
01:35:14.545 --> 01:35:16.113
Let's go, Mag, we don't have time!

1774
01:35:16.180 --> 01:35:17.748
At least that's what I was told

1775
01:35:17.782 --> 01:35:20.651
because she was the one
that was behind the wheel.

1776
01:35:20.685 --> 01:35:23.587
She was the one
who had murdered my mom.

1777
01:35:23.621 --> 01:35:25.322
-[Michael] Maggie-- 
-Which is the only reason

1778
01:35:25.356 --> 01:35:26.757
why he picked her.

1779
01:35:28.392 --> 01:35:30.094
At least that's what I was told.

1780
01:35:30.161 --> 01:35:31.529
[Michael] Look, enough is enough, all right?

1781
01:35:31.562 --> 01:35:34.065
Just give me the gun, baby.

1782
01:35:34.098 --> 01:35:36.434
But that's not the truth.

1783
01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.436
Is it, Dad?

1784
01:35:38.469 --> 01:35:41.238
Because this says that my mom

1785
01:35:41.305 --> 01:35:43.874
was the one who was under the influence.

1786
01:35:45.276 --> 01:35:47.244
That my mom

1787
01:35:47.311 --> 01:35:51.115
was the one who
passed out behind the wheel.

1788
01:35:51.148 --> 01:35:54.351
My mom is the one who hit Heather.

1789
01:35:54.385 --> 01:35:56.153
Look at here, Maggie.

1790
01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:58.322
I'll talk to you
about whatever you wanna know

1791
01:35:58.355 --> 01:36:01.292
whenever we get done with this but right now, 
I need that gun.

1792
01:36:01.325 --> 01:36:04.795
They found three substances in her system.

1793
01:36:04.862 --> 01:36:06.964
Would you like to see?

1794
01:36:06.997 --> 01:36:08.065
[Michael] Hey--

1795
01:36:10.701 --> 01:36:15.039
Benadryl, cocaine, and Temazepam.

1796
01:36:16.373 --> 01:36:20.211
The three main ingredients to your little cocktail.

1797
01:36:21.579 --> 01:36:23.280
Isn't that right, Pops?

1798
01:36:23.314 --> 01:36:27.318
Maggie, give me the gun, baby.

1799
01:36:27.384 --> 01:36:30.421
Did you kill my mom?

1800
01:36:30.488 --> 01:36:32.923
[Michael] Stop pointing that gun at me.

1801
01:36:32.957 --> 01:36:35.726
You poisoned my mom?

1802
01:36:35.793 --> 01:36:37.528
Stop pointing that damn gun at me.

1803
01:36:37.561 --> 01:36:39.597
[Joanna] And what was I?

1804
01:36:39.630 --> 01:36:41.198
Just collateral damage?

1805
01:36:41.265 --> 01:36:42.666
What if I was in the car?

1806
01:36:42.700 --> 01:36:44.902
Would I have just died, too?

1807
01:36:44.935 --> 01:36:46.837
Would you have even cared?

1808
01:36:46.871 --> 01:36:49.607
-[Michael] Maggie... 
-You killed my mom!

1809
01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:51.375
[Michael] Stop it, okay?

1810
01:36:51.442 --> 01:36:54.145
You killed my mom!

1811
01:36:54.211 --> 01:36:56.647
[Michael] I love you, baby girl.

1812
01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:59.250
Daddy would never do nothin' to hurt you.

1813
01:37:00.518 --> 01:37:05.389
Now give me that damn gun.

1814
01:37:05.422 --> 01:37:08.492
[tense music]

1815
01:37:10.361 --> 01:37:12.096
[Michael] Stop playing with me.

1816
01:37:15.399 --> 01:37:16.801
Playtime is over.

1817
01:37:16.867 --> 01:37:19.904
[tense music]

1818
01:37:24.008 --> 01:37:25.910
We gotta fix your mistakes.

1819
01:37:28.679 --> 01:37:30.548
Clearly, you can't do nothin' right.

1820
01:37:30.581 --> 01:37:32.316
You didn't even give this girl enough

1821
01:37:32.383 --> 01:37:33.484
of the damn medicine, did you?

1822
01:37:33.517 --> 01:37:35.553
She's getting her feelings back.

1823
01:37:35.619 --> 01:37:37.421
Damn!

1824
01:37:37.454 --> 01:37:39.156
[Joanna] No, you're right.

1825
01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:42.660
I didn't give her all of it, 
I was saving some.

1826
01:37:42.726 --> 01:37:44.495
Saving it for what?

1827
01:37:44.528 --> 01:37:46.964
Because I was saving some for you.

1828
01:37:47.031 --> 01:37:50.301
[Michael] What? [grunting]

1829
01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:57.541
What are you doing?

1830
01:37:59.109 --> 01:38:00.177
[grunts]

1831
01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.481
[Joanna] [yells] Damn it!

1832
01:38:04.548 --> 01:38:07.017
[tense music]

1833
01:38:07.051 --> 01:38:10.120
-Do not fight me! 
-[Michael grunting]

1834
01:38:12.089 --> 01:38:14.558
You killed my mom!

1835
01:38:15.025 --> 01:38:16.493
What are you doing?

1836
01:38:18.095 --> 01:38:19.763
[grunts] What are you doing, Maggie?

1837
01:38:19.797 --> 01:38:20.865
[grunts]

1838
01:38:20.931 --> 01:38:23.033
You killed my mom!

1839
01:38:23.067 --> 01:38:25.669
[tense music]

01:38:25.736 --> 01:38:27.004

1841
01:38:30.574 --> 01:38:32.710
[sobbing]

1842
01:38:36.814 --> 01:38:40.417
[dramatic music]

1843
01:38:40.451 --> 01:38:42.953
[police siren blares]

1844
01:38:42.987 --> 01:38:46.223
[dramatic music]

1845
01:38:50.928 --> 01:38:52.963
-Hey, Bradford, what's going on? 
-[Bradford] Hey.

1846
01:38:54.632 --> 01:38:55.933
Sorry, Mrs. Lawrence.

1847
01:38:57.201 --> 01:38:58.602
No body was found.

1848
01:38:59.770 --> 01:39:01.872
Your husband's missing.

1849
01:39:02.172 --> 01:39:04.074
What about Joanna?

1850
01:39:04.108 --> 01:39:06.377
She was rushed to a nearby hospital.

1851
01:39:06.443 --> 01:39:07.912
Her condition's critical.

1852
01:39:10.748 --> 01:39:13.484
You have no idea
what she is capable of.

1853
01:39:13.517 --> 01:39:15.252
She's contained, ma'am.

1854
01:39:15.286 --> 01:39:16.420
Trust me.

1855
01:39:16.453 --> 01:39:17.821
She isn't going anywhere.

1856
01:39:19.556 --> 01:39:20.724
You all have a great night.

1857
01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:25.562
