I happen to know that is
really good cake...


7
00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:43.984
Because I made it myself.

8
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.088
It's okay.
Happy Birthday.


9
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:50.123
Thank you.

10
00:02:10.812 --> 00:02:12.179
You're a goddamn liar.

11
00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:13.581
Oh, calm down.

12
00:02:13.615 --> 00:02:16.149
We decided it was going
to be a casual thing.


13
00:02:16.183 --> 00:02:17.519
Casual?

14
00:02:17.552 --> 00:02:19.554
You told me you loved me.

15
00:02:19.587 --> 00:02:21.656
It's an expression, Bernice.

16
00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.691
Go to hell.

17
00:03:20.848 --> 00:03:24.117
Anna?

18
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:25.553
Hello, Gerry.

19
00:03:25.587 --> 00:03:28.155
How did you get in?

20
00:03:29.757 --> 00:03:31.726
You invited me over for a drink

21
00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:34.696
and gave my shoulder
a little squeeze. Remember?


22
00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:38.298
I've been thinking about things.

23
00:03:38.332 --> 00:03:41.168
How short life is.

24
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:45.238
So, you decided to
seize the day?


25
00:03:45.272 --> 00:03:47.809
Well, you only get so many.

26
00:03:47.842 --> 00:03:51.479
Why don't you put on some music?
Set the mood?


27
00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:55.182
Great idea.

28
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.489
You have taste.

29
00:04:02.824 --> 00:04:05.158
Funny.
I didn't take you for much.


30
00:04:06.928 --> 00:04:09.196
Excuse me?

31
00:04:16.704 --> 00:04:18.873
Interesting.

32
00:04:18.906 --> 00:04:20.808
I would've gone for something a
little more


33
00:04:20.842 --> 00:04:24.746
atmospheric.

34
00:04:26.948 --> 00:04:29.717
Best to drink this vintage neat.

35
00:04:29.751 --> 00:04:31.819
- Maybe later.
- You sure?


36
00:04:31.853 --> 00:04:34.254
This is 80 years old.

37
00:04:34.287 --> 00:04:36.223
You can only get this
in Scotland.


38
00:04:36.256 --> 00:04:38.960
Very impressive.

39
00:04:38.993 --> 00:04:41.194
Mmm.

40
00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:44.532
Hmm. These are cool.

41
00:04:44.565 --> 00:04:45.867
So delicate.

42
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.568
Now, please be careful
with that.


43
00:04:47.602 --> 00:04:49.604
Everything is transitory, Gerry.

44
00:04:51.406 --> 00:04:54.842
Just ask her.

45
00:04:54.876 --> 00:04:57.512
How did you die?

46
00:04:57.545 --> 00:05:00.682
Where did you go?

47
00:05:00.715 --> 00:05:03.851
What do you think?

48
00:05:03.885 --> 00:05:07.422
I have no idea
what you're talking about.


49
00:05:07.455 --> 00:05:10.290
Where is her soul, Gerry?

50
00:05:10.323 --> 00:05:12.560
- Don't insult me, now.
- I'm keeping this.


51
00:05:12.593 --> 00:05:14.796
Like hell you are.

52
00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:17.999
You come over
to some lonely man's house


53
00:05:18.032 --> 00:05:20.735
and give him ideas,

54
00:05:20.768 --> 00:05:23.705
and then you act like
a spoiled child.


55
00:05:23.738 --> 00:05:25.873
Now, give it back.

56
00:05:25.907 --> 00:05:28.976
Why don't you come and get it?

57
00:05:37.552 --> 00:05:38.886
Mmm.

58
00:05:53.835 --> 00:05:56.637
This is for Bernice.

59
00:06:37.512 --> 00:06:40.715
Ugh. 'Morning.

60
00:06:44.018 --> 00:06:45.953
Ugh.

61
00:06:58.866 --> 00:07:00.067
Hint of cherry.

62
00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:02.302
Oak.

63
00:07:07.508 --> 00:07:09.477
Tart finish. Hmm.

64
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.747
Get your stuff, Robbie.

65
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:14.982
What'd I do this time?

66
00:07:16.684 --> 00:07:18.119
Yep. You have to leave.

67
00:07:18.152 --> 00:07:20.521
All right. Whatever it is,
just... I'm very sorry.


68
00:07:20.555 --> 00:07:23.558
Just please let me wake up,
and then I'll help you clean.


69
00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:24.826
Okay?

70
00:07:24.859 --> 00:07:26.861
You really don't remember?

71
00:07:30.498 --> 00:07:31.532
Did I get some?

72
00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:36.070
You made out with my fiancé.

73
00:07:36.103 --> 00:07:37.905
Doug?

74
00:07:43.544 --> 00:07:45.112
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

75
00:07:45.146 --> 00:07:46.914
This isn't funny, Robbie.

76
00:07:46.948 --> 00:07:48.482
Okay, okay. I'm sorry, though,
okay?


77
00:07:48.516 --> 00:07:50.017
Please, please. Just...
It didn't mean anything.


78
00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:52.720
It was just a couple of guys
having fun, all right?


79
00:07:52.753 --> 00:07:54.622
You can't crash here anymore.

80
00:07:54.655 --> 00:07:56.991
Look. Take a step back,
all right?


81
00:07:57.024 --> 00:07:58.092
You know,

82
00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:01.529
I thought maybe, just maybe,

83
00:08:01.562 --> 00:08:04.932
you'd stick it through rehab
eventually, but it...


84
00:08:04.966 --> 00:08:06.934
You didn't want to admit
your own brother


85
00:08:06.968 --> 00:08:10.738
is nothing more than
a worthless sack of shit.


86
00:08:13.608 --> 00:08:15.643
You make out with one dude.

87
00:08:20.615 --> 00:08:22.617
You know what?

88
00:08:23.818 --> 00:08:26.654
I was suffocating here.

89
00:08:26.687 --> 00:08:28.556
Now, I'm free, 
I'm really free,

90
00:08:28.589 --> 00:08:31.425
to go out there
and find my destiny.


91
00:08:31.459 --> 00:08:34.462
So, hey.

92
00:08:34.495 --> 00:08:36.497
Thank you.

93
00:09:40.094 --> 00:09:42.029
Can I ask you a question?

94
00:09:42.063 --> 00:09:44.598
- I'm not giving you money.
- I don't want your money.


95
00:09:44.632 --> 00:09:46.634
Where do we go when we die?

96
00:09:53.174 --> 00:09:55.743
You tell me.

97
00:09:55.776 --> 00:09:57.778
I have no idea.

98
00:09:59.113 --> 00:10:01.582
I need to find out...

99
00:10:01.615 --> 00:10:03.851
...now.

100
00:10:03.884 --> 00:10:06.754
What's the rush?

101
00:10:06.787 --> 00:10:10.925
I think it's time for me to,

102
00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.693
you know,

103
00:10:12.727 --> 00:10:14.295
end it.

104
00:10:14.328 --> 00:10:17.198
So, do it, then.

105
00:10:17.231 --> 00:10:19.667
That's the thing.

106
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.703
I'm fuckin' terrified
of what comes next.


107
00:10:24.238 --> 00:10:26.240
Oh, I've done some shit.

108
00:10:32.146 --> 00:10:34.882
Okay.

109
00:10:34.915 --> 00:10:38.919
Um, I absolve you
of all your sins.


110
00:10:42.723 --> 00:10:45.960
That's a nice gesture. Thanks.
I just...


111
00:10:45.993 --> 00:10:47.695
I don't think you have
the authority.


112
00:10:47.728 --> 00:10:49.730
- Nobody does.
- No.


113
00:10:52.666 --> 00:10:54.135
Somebody does.

114
00:10:54.168 --> 00:10:59.140
I'm going to meet him, tonight.

115
00:10:59.173 --> 00:11:02.710
No. You're not.

116
00:11:02.743 --> 00:11:04.712
There's nothing.

117
00:11:04.745 --> 00:11:08.749
You just go out like a candle.

118
00:11:15.289 --> 00:11:17.291
That doesn't sound so bad.

119
00:11:22.296 --> 00:11:25.933
What are you doing tonight?

120
00:11:25.966 --> 00:11:28.769
None of your business.

121
00:11:30.905 --> 00:11:32.907
Sounds fun. Can I come?

122
00:11:39.647 --> 00:11:41.649
Up to you.

123
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:43.711
Well...

124
00:12:43.744 --> 00:12:47.748
Um, I don't have anywhere else
to go, so...


125
00:12:49.083 --> 00:12:52.253
So?

126
00:12:52.286 --> 00:12:56.824
Maybe I can just come in
for a bit...


127
00:12:56.857 --> 00:12:58.859
...and warm up?

128
00:13:00.327 --> 00:13:04.865
Maybe have a drink
and I'll be on my way.


129
00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:07.935
I don't drink alcohol.

130
00:13:07.968 --> 00:13:09.336
Oh.

131
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.139
Then, make tonight an exception.

132
00:13:45.139 --> 00:13:48.142
Hello? You there?

133
00:13:51.912 --> 00:13:53.914
Jesus. Come on.

134
00:13:57.284 --> 00:14:01.288
All right. It's officially
super weird now.


135
00:14:02.923 --> 00:14:04.925
You didn't even tell me
your name.


136
00:14:09.196 --> 00:14:11.198
Anna.

137
00:14:12.534 --> 00:14:14.802
Hi, Anna.

138
00:14:14.835 --> 00:14:17.938
Um, I'm Robbie.

139
00:14:17.972 --> 00:14:19.974
Hi, Robbie.

140
00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:25.379
So, how about that drink, huh?

141
00:14:25.413 --> 00:14:27.415
I might have something
lying around.


142
00:14:42.497 --> 00:14:45.966
This scotch is 80 years old.

143
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.968
You sure I can have
some of this?


144
00:14:48.002 --> 00:14:51.071
Knock yourself out.

145
00:14:57.845 --> 00:14:59.013
Smoky.

146
00:15:01.282 --> 00:15:02.983
Like your eyes.

147
00:15:03.017 --> 00:15:05.019
I don't fuck humans.

148
00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:11.493
Right.

149
00:15:34.081 --> 00:15:36.083
Tilt your head back.

150
00:15:44.992 --> 00:15:46.960
What are you doing?

151
00:15:46.994 --> 00:15:48.896
Exploring your veins.

152
00:15:51.031 --> 00:15:54.268
Feels... feels good.

153
00:15:54.301 --> 00:15:57.605
Different blood
has different qualities.


154
00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:59.541
Taste.

155
00:15:59.574 --> 00:16:01.576
Kick.

156
00:16:04.044 --> 00:16:06.046
I'm trying to guess
what yours is like.


157
00:16:11.686 --> 00:16:13.887
Afraid?

158
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.591
No.

159
00:16:18.359 --> 00:16:20.361
I'm a vampire.

160
00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:26.133
I kind of figured.

161
00:16:26.166 --> 00:16:29.169
I'm going to suck your blood
and get high as fuck.


162
00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:34.341
Okay.

163
00:16:34.375 --> 00:16:36.343
I'm going to kill you.

164
00:16:39.681 --> 00:16:41.882
Get on with it, then.

165
00:16:52.092 --> 00:16:54.094
You're really not afraid?

166
00:16:55.195 --> 00:16:57.197
No.

167
00:16:59.299 --> 00:17:01.301
I'm ready.

168
00:17:06.106 --> 00:17:08.108
Okay, then.

169
00:17:11.479 --> 00:17:13.147
- Wait.
- It's too late.


170
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.182
No, no. Please. I just...

171
00:17:16.651 --> 00:17:20.120
I got one last thing I need.

172
00:17:40.775 --> 00:17:42.976
That shit is expensive.

173
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.012
Yeah, it is.

174
00:17:48.282 --> 00:17:49.517
It's cost me everything.

175
00:17:52.754 --> 00:17:56.591
I vow not to have another drink

176
00:17:56.624 --> 00:17:58.626
as long as I live.

177
00:18:05.467 --> 00:18:08.470
Okay.

178
00:18:11.104 --> 00:18:13.608
Now I'm ready.

179
00:18:22.115 --> 00:18:24.486
Is it going to hurt?

180
00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:27.422
You might feel a little pinch.

181
00:18:27.455 --> 00:18:28.656
That's it?

182
00:18:30.257 --> 00:18:32.259
It's going to hurt quite a bit.

183
00:18:38.298 --> 00:18:40.300
Make it quick, then.

184
00:18:57.485 --> 00:18:59.487
What are you waiting for?

185
00:19:00.655 --> 00:19:04.425
Most people don't go so easily.

186
00:19:06.694 --> 00:19:09.564
They scream.

187
00:19:09.597 --> 00:19:12.534
They cry. They fight.

188
00:19:13.768 --> 00:19:16.671
I never understood it.

189
00:19:16.704 --> 00:19:18.171
I mean, no matter what,

190
00:19:18.205 --> 00:19:20.073
it's going to happen somehow,
someday.


191
00:19:20.107 --> 00:19:22.109
Now or later,
what's the difference?


192
00:19:32.487 --> 00:19:34.489
Good night.

193
00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:43.598
Can I sleep here?

194
00:21:05.546 --> 00:21:06.814
Gus.

195
00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:10.818
What do you think
you're doing here?


196
00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:13.454
I'm going to start over.

197
00:21:13.488 --> 00:21:14.789
Listen.

198
00:21:14.822 --> 00:21:17.357
I know I made a lot of mistakes,
all right?


199
00:21:17.392 --> 00:21:19.359
I'm sorry.
But things are going to be


200
00:21:19.394 --> 00:21:20.561
completely different now, okay?

201
00:21:20.595 --> 00:21:22.430
What do you want, Robbie?

202
00:21:22.463 --> 00:21:24.699
Gus, I just want
to make amends, okay?


203
00:21:26.266 --> 00:21:27.802
You're not getting
your job back.


204
00:21:27.835 --> 00:21:31.939
No, no. You think this is about
some dishwashing job? No.


205
00:21:31.973 --> 00:21:33.941
No, no.
It's so much more than that.


206
00:21:33.975 --> 00:21:36.744
It's about me.
It's about who I am.


207
00:21:36.778 --> 00:21:40.313
You know, I just want to be
a good person, okay?


208
00:21:40.347 --> 00:21:42.884
I can't do anything for you.

209
00:21:42.917 --> 00:21:44.919
Go get yourself cleaned up.

210
00:21:46.888 --> 00:21:48.890
That's what I'm trying to
tell you.


211
00:21:48.923 --> 00:21:51.492
But I need help. Please, Gus.

212
00:21:51.526 --> 00:21:53.594
We're going to be
getting busy soon.


213
00:21:53.628 --> 00:21:55.630
Go home.

214
00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:16.484
Stop. Take it easy.

215
00:22:16.517 --> 00:22:19.020
Let me do my job.

216
00:22:19.053 --> 00:22:22.322
I don't even know
how you're still here.


217
00:22:22.355 --> 00:22:25.258
The Grim Reaper is going to come
for me when he wants.


218
00:22:25.292 --> 00:22:27.995
But if he thinks I'm going to
lie around waiting for him,


219
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:30.031
he's got another "think" coming.

220
00:22:30.064 --> 00:22:31.566
Can't run. Can't hide.

221
00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:33.300
Thank you.

222
00:22:33.333 --> 00:22:36.303
Most people
just avoid the subject


223
00:22:36.336 --> 00:22:38.973
or treat me with pity.

224
00:22:39.006 --> 00:22:40.441
It's so exhausting.

225
00:22:45.413 --> 00:22:47.448
You seen Gerry today?

226
00:22:47.482 --> 00:22:48.916
No.

227
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:50.952
Weird.

228
00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:25.987
Hello?

229
00:23:27.622 --> 00:23:30.992
Still here?

230
00:23:31.025 --> 00:23:33.027

Let's figure out
how I can help.

I'll think about it

268
00:27:06.107 --> 00:27:09.076
Tough to get service
in here, huh?


269
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.545
Yeah. This place must be union.

270
00:27:11.579 --> 00:27:13.948
What is the world coming to?

271
00:27:13.981 --> 00:27:18.085
I got this chick over there
waiting for me.


272
00:27:18.119 --> 00:27:20.287
She's got to be, like,
I don't know, 20?


273
00:27:20.321 --> 00:27:21.956
Nina?

274
00:27:21.989 --> 00:27:23.324
She's an old friend.

275
00:27:23.357 --> 00:27:24.759
Really?

276
00:27:24.792 --> 00:27:26.794
Oh, you know her?

277
00:27:26.827 --> 00:27:29.030
Okay.

278
00:27:29.063 --> 00:27:31.265
So then, I decided

279
00:27:31.298 --> 00:27:32.867
to make life my bitch.

280
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.735
All right? No more kissing ass.

00:30:09.524 --> 00:30:11.493

00:30:18.999 --> 00:30:21.168
Guys, seriously.
Take a closer look.


340
00:30:21.202 --> 00:30:22.970
- What?
- Who does he remind you of?


341
00:30:23.003 --> 00:30:24.205
What?

342
00:30:24.238 --> 00:30:25.973
Oh, my God.

343
00:30:26.006 --> 00:30:28.108
- The Baron.
- The Baron!


344
00:30:31.078 --> 00:30:32.346
Let's do this.

345
00:30:32.379 --> 00:30:35.249
Who's the Baron? Who's the...
Okay.


346
00:30:35.282 --> 00:30:37.251
- Yes!
- Oh, that's good.


347
00:30:46.093 --> 00:30:48.062
So, how do you guys know
each other?


348
00:30:48.095 --> 00:30:52.199
Oh. Uh, we hunt together.

349
00:30:52.233 --> 00:30:54.235
Okay.

350
00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:59.306
Seriously,
we're a pack of cheetahs,


351
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.342

360
00:31:30.405 --> 00:31:31.406
Hold on a sec.

361
00:31:31.439 --> 00:31:33.173
No.

362
00:31:33.207 --> 00:31:37.211
Let him do one last line.

363
00:31:48.523 --> 00:31:51.526
Oh. Ah.

364
00:31:51.559 --> 00:31:56.263
Just stay right there.

365
00:31:56.297 --> 00:31:59.434
Um, wait. I...

366
00:31:59.467 --> 00:32:01.335
Ow!

367
00:32:04.371 --> 00:32:08.610
Ugh!

368
00:32:56.156 --> 00:32:58.158
Shut up.

369
00:33:02.464 --> 00:33:05.032
Thank you.

370
00:33:19.113 --> 00:33:21.416
It's Mom.

371
00:33:21.449 --> 00:33:25.453
Sorry, Mom.
Ben is permanently unavailable.


372
00:33:31.992 --> 00:33:34.361
What was your mom like, Boris?

373
00:33:34.396 --> 00:33:36.363
Oh, fine, I guess.

374
00:33:36.398 --> 00:33:38.400
I don't really remember.

375
00:33:41.101 --> 00:33:43.103
I remember being
in a dark room...


376
00:33:45.239 --> 00:33:47.241
...and not allowed to leave.

377
00:33:50.545 --> 00:33:54.214
Sometimes the door would open,

378
00:33:54.248 --> 00:33:57.251
and a woman would come in
and beat me with a stick.


379
00:33:59.421 --> 00:34:01.423
I think that was my mom.

380
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:04.992
Tell us about your mom again,
Anna.


381
00:34:09.196 --> 00:34:11.198
I have to go to work.

382
00:34:13.267 --> 00:34:17.971
Please, indulge me
one more time.


383
00:34:18.005 --> 00:34:21.975
Why do you go to that job
every day?


384
00:34:22.009 --> 00:34:24.011
It's beneath you.

385
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.384
I can't live looting the dead.

386
00:34:31.051 --> 00:34:33.053
It's undignified.

387
00:34:35.289 --> 00:34:37.324
Besides, I like books.

388
00:34:56.176 --> 00:34:57.645
Oh, come on.

389
00:34:57.679 --> 00:35:01.348
Oh, shit! Shit.

390
00:35:01.381 --> 00:35:05.352
What happened?

391
00:35:05.386 --> 00:35:08.490
I spilled some pills.

392
00:35:08.523 --> 00:35:10.458
You take all of these?

393
00:35:10.492 --> 00:35:12.494
Yep.

394
00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:13.695
It's ridiculous.

395
00:35:13.728 --> 00:35:15.430
Oh, my God.

396
00:35:15.463 --> 00:35:16.798
How do you swallow that?

397
00:35:16.831 --> 00:35:19.166
I know. They sprung this one
on me yesterday.


398
00:35:19.199 --> 00:35:21.201
It's supposed to help
with the side effects.


399
00:35:25.607 --> 00:35:28.476
I don't know.

400
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:30.745
Maybe it's not worth it.

401
00:35:40.755 --> 00:35:42.757
Hey.

402
00:35:47.729 --> 00:35:49.464
Hey!

403
00:35:49.497 --> 00:35:52.165
Hmm?

404
00:35:52.199 --> 00:35:54.201
Tell me again
why you're doing this.


405
00:35:57.805 --> 00:35:59.807
For the laughs.

406
00:35:59.841 --> 00:36:02.042
Just have a drink.

407
00:36:03.678 --> 00:36:06.313
You could end it all right now.

408
00:36:10.284 --> 00:36:13.120
You think this is a joke?

409
00:36:16.524 --> 00:36:18.526
You watch me.

410
00:37:50.317 --> 00:37:51.552
Hey.

411
00:37:51.586 --> 00:37:53.588
I brought you something.

412
00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:14.669
Good morning.

413
00:39:14.702 --> 00:39:17.505
You sound different.

414
00:39:17.538 --> 00:39:19.707
I woke up this morning,
and I looked at


415
00:39:19.741 --> 00:39:22.309
the pile of pills
in the organizer


416
00:39:22.342 --> 00:39:25.813
and I thought,
I don't want these.


417
00:39:25.847 --> 00:39:27.482
What?

418
00:39:27.515 --> 00:39:29.851
And so, I didn't take them,
and you know what?


419
00:39:29.884 --> 00:39:31.786
I feel like a million bucks.

420
00:39:31.819 --> 00:39:33.353
- Don't you need those?
- No, no.


421
00:39:33.387 --> 00:39:36.591
I don't believe the lies
anymore.


422
00:39:36.624 --> 00:39:41.629
I'm going on faith.
Faith and sheer willpower.


423
00:39:44.732 --> 00:39:46.734
I know what I'm doing.

424
00:39:48.736 --> 00:39:51.005
I know what I'm doing.

425
00:40:32.413 --> 00:40:34.415
Go away!

426
00:40:47.929 --> 00:40:50.832
You okay?

427
00:40:50.865 --> 00:40:52.466
Robbie?

428
00:40:54.669 --> 00:40:56.671
Hey.

429
00:40:58.739 --> 00:41:00.741
Robbie!

430
00:41:18.693 --> 00:41:20.461
Shit.

431
00:41:22.864 --> 00:41:25.867
Hey. Come on. Come on.

432
00:41:42.717 --> 00:41:44.018
Robbie.

433
00:41:44.051 --> 00:41:46.854
Robbie? Robbie!

434
00:41:46.888 --> 00:41:49.090
Robbie, wake up!

435
00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:55.763
It's freezing.

436
00:41:55.796 --> 00:41:58.699
I thought you were dead.

437
00:41:58.733 --> 00:42:00.801
So did I.

438
00:42:00.835 --> 00:42:02.837
I think you saved my life.

439
00:42:08.976 --> 00:42:10.645
Clean up.

440
00:42:10.678 --> 00:42:12.680
You reek.

441
00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.262
Can I help you?

442
00:43:01.295 --> 00:43:02.930
You're Lara, the artist, right?

443
00:43:02.964 --> 00:43:04.532
Oh, somebody's heard of me?

444
00:43:04.565 --> 00:43:06.233
Of course I have.

445
00:43:06.267 --> 00:43:09.003
I brought some friends.

446
00:43:09.036 --> 00:43:11.038
They might want to buy
something.


447
00:43:15.242 --> 00:43:16.978
Hi.

448
00:43:17.011 --> 00:43:19.013
Okay. Come in.

449
00:43:27.955 --> 00:43:31.592
Such balanced form.

450
00:43:31.625 --> 00:43:33.995
Please. We don't have to do
art-school talk.


451
00:43:36.664 --> 00:43:39.133
Talk to me about
where this came from.


452
00:43:39.166 --> 00:43:41.969
Sculpture is talking.

453
00:43:42.003 --> 00:43:44.739
- Just look at it.
- She's right.


454
00:43:44.772 --> 00:43:48.909
Talking about art is like
drawing legs on a snake.


455
00:43:48.943 --> 00:43:50.945
Well said.

456
00:43:52.646 --> 00:43:54.615
This is the one
they'll remember you by.


457
00:43:56.083 --> 00:43:59.854
God. Who cares? I'll be dust.

458
00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:03.057
But your art will live forever.

459
00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:05.259
I'm not in this
to create forever.


460
00:44:05.292 --> 00:44:07.294
Why do you do it?

461
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:11.565
I do it to make
the spirit flesh.


462
00:44:11.599 --> 00:44:14.168
Is that the kind of thing
you want to hear?


463
00:44:14.201 --> 00:44:17.204
People will look at this
after you're gone.


464
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:23.177
They'll look at it
and they'll remember you.


465
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:25.846
They will miss you.

466
00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.082
I won't be able to do much
about that.


467
00:44:30.184 --> 00:44:32.186
Deep, deep in the ground.

468
00:44:34.221 --> 00:44:36.223
So fearless.

469
00:44:38.859 --> 00:44:41.862
I wouldn't say so.

470
00:44:46.634 --> 00:44:48.636
Stop.

471
00:44:49.904 --> 00:44:53.607
Not this one.

472
00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:55.643
We are already here, Anna.

473
00:44:58.913 --> 00:45:01.816
People die all the time.

474
00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:04.151
Think about it.

475
00:45:04.185 --> 00:45:07.888
Someone, somewhere,
is dying this very second.


476
00:45:12.427 --> 00:45:14.028
And this one.

477
00:45:20.402 --> 00:45:22.136
And this one.

478
00:45:26.307 --> 00:45:28.876
And this one.

479
00:45:31.446 --> 00:45:33.647
You're here to kill me?

480
00:46:13.287 --> 00:46:15.923
Hey.

481
00:46:22.863 --> 00:46:24.865
Sit beside me?

482
00:46:55.162 --> 00:46:59.166
Your work history has some gaps.
What were you doing then?


483
00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.770
Uh, honestly,
I don't really remember.


484
00:47:02.803 --> 00:47:06.140
Hmm. Well, don't really need
any dishwashers at the moment.


485
00:47:06.173 --> 00:47:07.475
Well, that's perfect.

486
00:47:07.509 --> 00:47:09.843
I'm sick and tired of hiding
in the back.


487
00:47:09.877 --> 00:47:11.245
I need to reinvent myself.

488
00:47:11.278 --> 00:47:13.415
I want to be a waiter,
out front, interacting,


489
00:47:13.448 --> 00:47:15.983
serving people. I think
I'd be really good at it.


490
00:47:16.016 --> 00:47:18.786
You don't even have
bussing experience.


491
00:47:18.819 --> 00:47:20.955
Well, let's start there, then.

492
00:47:22.923 --> 00:47:24.892
Okay. Well, we'll call you.

493
00:47:24.925 --> 00:47:26.093
I don't have a phone.

494
00:47:26.126 --> 00:47:28.963
Mm-hmm.

495
00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:36.870
Shh.

496
00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:08.202
- Hey, stranger.
- Holy shit. Vanessa.


497
00:48:08.235 --> 00:48:11.305
You look great.

498
00:48:11.338 --> 00:48:12.507
Thanks.

499
00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.509
How you been?

500
00:48:14.542 --> 00:48:15.543
Uh, unemployed.

501
00:48:15.577 --> 00:48:17.011
Fine. Perfect.

502
00:48:17.044 --> 00:48:19.414
You have time for a drink,
then.


503
00:48:19.447 --> 00:48:21.849
Uh, I don't drink anymore.

504
00:48:21.882 --> 00:48:23.451
No way.

505
00:48:23.485 --> 00:48:25.487
No, it's true.

506
00:48:27.254 --> 00:48:28.956
Well, get in anyway.

507
00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:31.225
Uh, I don't think
that's such a good idea.


508
00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:34.194
You know, Robbie,

509
00:48:34.228 --> 00:48:37.264
if you can't face your triggers,

510
00:48:37.298 --> 00:48:40.334
you haven't really
beaten them yet.


511
00:48:48.108 --> 00:48:50.844
♪ And your doubting mind ♪

512
00:48:50.878 --> 00:48:55.149

513
00:48:55.182 --> 00:48:56.350

515
00:48:59.253 --> 00:49:01.523
Next time, dear,

516
00:49:01.556 --> 00:49:04.091
you only shake cocktails
with juice.


517
00:49:04.124 --> 00:49:07.194
Old-fashioned you-just-stir.

518
00:49:07.227 --> 00:49:10.998
Yes.

519
00:49:11.031 --> 00:49:12.199
How's your water?

520
00:49:12.232 --> 00:49:13.401
Um, cold.

521
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:17.871
Hmm.

522
00:49:19.306 --> 00:49:21.008
Oh, I'm sorry.

523
00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:23.578
I shouldn't be enjoying this
so much in front of you.


524
00:49:23.611 --> 00:49:26.046
No problem. Don't worry.

525
00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.315
I thought about you a lot.

526
00:49:28.349 --> 00:49:32.420
Good God, why? I was a mess.

527
00:49:32.454 --> 00:49:34.589
Well, you were a hot mess.

528
00:49:34.622 --> 00:49:36.391
Looks aren't everything.

529
00:49:36.424 --> 00:49:39.927
No, but they're not nothing.

530
00:49:42.996 --> 00:49:45.099
Tell me a story.

531
00:49:45.132 --> 00:49:46.601
Oh, God.

532
00:49:46.634 --> 00:49:50.337
I'm sleeping on
a vampire's couch.


533
00:49:52.172 --> 00:49:56.110
Like, an emotional vampire?

534
00:49:56.143 --> 00:49:58.546
Sure.

535
00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.180
Cute?

536
00:50:00.214 --> 00:50:02.617
Very. Sorry.

537
00:50:02.650 --> 00:50:05.420
But she's going to suck the life
right out of you.


538
00:50:06.721 --> 00:50:10.625
I don't know yet.

539
00:50:10.658 --> 00:50:13.461
Well, if she ever gets to be
too much,


540
00:50:13.495 --> 00:50:15.497
I have a guest bedroom.

541
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:17.532
It's nice.

542
00:50:19.333 --> 00:50:21.034
I just got clean.

543
00:50:21.068 --> 00:50:24.238
Well, I'm not going to
pour booze down your throat.


544
00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:25.440
But you will, though.

545
00:50:25.473 --> 00:50:27.475
Come on.

546
00:50:27.509 --> 00:50:31.111
I just want to take care of you,
you know?


547
00:50:31.145 --> 00:50:34.081
At least for a little while.

548
00:50:35.483 --> 00:50:37.951
I'm not asking for help.

549
00:50:37.985 --> 00:50:41.255
I know, but sometimes things
just fall from the sky.


550
00:50:41.288 --> 00:50:43.458
I just don't know
if I'd do too well


551
00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:45.959
in a gilded cage, so...

552
00:50:48.028 --> 00:50:50.632
Okay.

553
00:50:51.733 --> 00:50:53.133
Well, the offer is open.

554
00:50:53.167 --> 00:50:56.671
Take my card.

555
00:50:56.704 --> 00:50:59.707
And you call me, day or night.

556
00:51:02.009 --> 00:51:04.011
I mean it.

557
00:51:22.797 --> 00:51:24.998
Bernice?

558
00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:30.572
Hi.

559
00:51:35.677 --> 00:51:39.581
Now I'm the one
who looks like death.


560
00:51:39.614 --> 00:51:42.784
What happened?

561
00:51:42.817 --> 00:51:45.587
Oh, things
are just being cut short


562
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.622
a little sooner
than we expected.


563
00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:52.059
How do you feel?

564
00:51:53.428 --> 00:51:55.430
I'm in agony.

565
00:51:59.166 --> 00:52:01.168
But it'll all be over soon.

566
00:52:03.738 --> 00:52:06.774
I mean, the agony ends,
but so does everything else.


567
00:52:06.808 --> 00:52:09.009
And to top it all off,
you're here.


568
00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:17.452
I used to have nightmares
that I had a fatal disease,


569
00:52:17.485 --> 00:52:19.687
and I'd be so relieved
when I woke up


570
00:52:19.721 --> 00:52:21.723
and knew it was just a dream.

571
00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:28.563
Could you wake me up, Anna?

572
00:52:28.596 --> 00:52:31.298
Wake up, Bernice.

573
00:52:31.331 --> 00:52:35.703
I wish I could offer you
some hope,


574
00:52:35.737 --> 00:52:39.039
but I can't think of any.

575
00:52:42.276 --> 00:52:44.278
What if...

576
00:52:47.347 --> 00:52:49.349
What if what?

577
00:52:56.824 --> 00:53:00.227
Nothing.

578
00:54:54.509 --> 00:54:56.511
Why now?

579
00:54:57.578 --> 00:54:59.480
Oh, God.

580
00:54:59.514 --> 00:55:03.518
Well, you know, you barrelled
in here and you jumped on me.


581
00:55:06.521 --> 00:55:08.523
Do I need a reason?

582
00:55:10.958 --> 00:55:13.728
Maybe I just felt like it.

583
00:55:13.761 --> 00:55:16.363
Come on.

584
00:55:16.397 --> 00:55:18.399
Look deep into your heart.

585
00:55:25.272 --> 00:55:27.274
Someone I work with is dying.

586
00:55:28.810 --> 00:55:30.812
She might already be gone.

587
00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:38.386
Sorry.

588
00:55:38.419 --> 00:55:40.421
Don't be sorry.

589
00:55:43.558 --> 00:55:48.563
So, you wanted to, uh,
make the pain go away?


590
00:55:53.568 --> 00:55:54.902
Who is that?

591
00:55:54.936 --> 00:55:57.572
Nobody. Just ignore it.

592
00:55:57.605 --> 00:56:00.875
Ah. So, you do have friends.

593
00:56:00.908 --> 00:56:02.910
Let's see who these people are.

594
00:56:07.347 --> 00:56:08.516
Oh.

595
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:10.551
Come on in.

596
00:56:14.889 --> 00:56:16.991
You idiot.

597
00:56:17.024 --> 00:56:19.560
You have no idea
what they can do to you.


598
00:56:19.594 --> 00:56:21.729
You can protect me, right?

599
00:56:21.763 --> 00:56:23.765
I don't know if I can do that.

600
00:56:26.868 --> 00:56:28.669
Who's this?

601
00:56:28.703 --> 00:56:30.438
He has nothing to do with you.

602
00:56:30.471 --> 00:56:31.806
Don't tell me you fucked it.

603
00:56:31.839 --> 00:56:33.373
Anna.

604
00:56:33.407 --> 00:56:36.611
When was the last time you fed?

605
00:56:36.644 --> 00:56:37.879
You look like hell.

606
00:56:37.912 --> 00:56:39.881
I don't know. A few days.

607
00:56:39.914 --> 00:56:42.850
Okay. You need to feed, now.

608
00:56:42.884 --> 00:56:46.754
No. I think I'm going to lay off
for a while.


609
00:56:46.788 --> 00:56:48.456
You can't lay off.

610
00:56:48.489 --> 00:56:50.458
Then I guess I'll have to
kick altogether.


611
00:56:50.491 --> 00:56:52.059
Kick?

612
00:56:52.093 --> 00:56:53.928
You'll die.

613
00:56:53.961 --> 00:56:55.997
You've seen what happens.

614
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:58.399
Maybe I'll become human again.

615
00:57:00.067 --> 00:57:03.905
Remember, they are cattle
and not pets. Okay?


616
00:57:03.938 --> 00:57:06.574
Frolicking with the humans
makes you one of them.


617
00:57:06.607 --> 00:57:08.509
An animal.

618
00:57:08.543 --> 00:57:11.412
Take a deep breath
and let it pass.


619
00:57:11.445 --> 00:57:12.814
You're wrong, Boris.

620
00:57:12.847 --> 00:57:14.982
You haven't fed,
and it's messing with your head.


621
00:57:15.016 --> 00:57:17.084
We need to do this, Anna.

622
00:57:17.118 --> 00:57:20.388
You'll thank us later.

623
00:57:20.421 --> 00:57:21.789
Robbie, run,
and don't come back.


624
00:57:21.823 --> 00:57:23.356
- No.
- No. I will be fine.


625
00:57:23.391 --> 00:57:24.926
- I'm not leaving you.
- Listen to me.


626
00:57:24.959 --> 00:57:27.628
If you don't go,
I will have to kill you myself.


627
00:57:27.662 --> 00:57:29.362
You don't want them to do it.

628
00:57:29.397 --> 00:57:31.098
Go!

629
00:57:35.469 --> 00:57:37.905
Great.

630
00:57:37.939 --> 00:57:39.473
Now, we have to go hunt.

631
00:57:39.507 --> 00:57:41.442
You can't change, Anna.

632
00:57:41.475 --> 00:57:42.710
I need to be alone.

633
00:57:42.743 --> 00:57:46.714
Leave.

634
00:57:48.649 --> 00:57:50.885
Well, that's it, then.

635
00:57:50.918 --> 00:57:53.487
You're just going to sit here
by yourself and die?


636
00:57:53.521 --> 00:57:55.423
She'll come around.

637
00:57:55.456 --> 00:57:57.458
She just needs time.

638
00:57:58.659 --> 00:58:01.662
You know we will find him,
right?


639
00:58:01.696 --> 00:58:03.698
Eventually.

640
00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:24.652
What's going on, Robbie?

641
00:58:27.021 --> 00:58:29.023
You're not going to understand.

642
00:58:30.558 --> 00:58:32.560
Try me.

643
00:58:37.198 --> 00:58:39.400
I just left her there.

644
00:58:43.037 --> 00:58:45.940
Oh, yeah.

645
00:58:45.973 --> 00:58:47.975
The bloodsucker.

646
00:58:50.011 --> 00:58:52.980
If you want, I can pour you one.

647
00:58:53.014 --> 00:58:55.850
That's a bad idea.

648
00:58:58.552 --> 00:58:59.720
I get it.

649
00:58:59.754 --> 00:59:03.024
You're scared.

650
00:59:03.057 --> 00:59:04.625
Maybe.

651
00:59:06.494 --> 00:59:10.831
You're scared that

652
00:59:10.865 --> 00:59:15.870
people are going to think
that you're just a lousy drunk.


653
00:59:20.041 --> 00:59:22.043
But I'm not going to judge you.

654
00:59:26.247 --> 00:59:28.649
All I want

655
00:59:28.683 --> 00:59:31.018
is for you to be...

656
00:59:36.223 --> 00:59:39.760
...who you really are.

657
00:59:43.798 --> 00:59:46.100
It's okay.

658
01:00:34.882 --> 01:00:36.884
Are you okay?

659
01:01:11.218 --> 01:01:13.220
'Morning, Anna.

660
01:03:16.744 --> 01:03:18.012
What time is it?

661
01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:20.047
Who cares?

662
01:03:21.749 --> 01:03:22.983
Oh.

663
01:03:31.025 --> 01:03:32.826
Can you just forget her?

664
01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:36.398
Tell you what.

665
01:03:36.431 --> 01:03:39.366
Let's get away from here.

666
01:03:39.401 --> 01:03:43.103
Let's go to the cabin.

667
01:03:43.137 --> 01:03:45.139
She needs my help.

668
01:03:48.242 --> 01:03:51.378
She's not your responsibility.

669
01:03:51.413 --> 01:03:53.781
Where are your keys?

670
01:03:53.814 --> 01:03:54.982
You're not driving.

671
01:03:55.015 --> 01:03:56.518
Don't wait up for me, all right?

672
01:03:56.551 --> 01:03:57.985
Robbie, Robbie.

673
01:03:58.018 --> 01:04:00.354
Fine.

674
01:04:00.388 --> 01:04:04.058
I need a word with this bitch.

675
01:04:14.235 --> 01:04:17.238
Please stay in the car.

676
01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:19.173
Not on your life.

677
01:04:19.206 --> 01:04:21.208
Stay! Stay in the c...

678
01:04:23.277 --> 01:04:25.279
Hello?

679
01:04:28.015 --> 01:04:29.783
Oh, my God.

680
01:04:29.817 --> 01:04:32.219
Oh, my God, Anna.

681
01:04:32.253 --> 01:04:35.322
This is what
you've been so obsessed with?


682
01:04:40.595 --> 01:04:44.098
Just what kind of hold do you
have on him, you junkie witch?


683
01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:48.002
If you don't get out of
his head, I will beat your ass.


684
01:04:48.035 --> 01:04:49.203
- Okay?
- Okay.


685
01:04:49.236 --> 01:04:50.505
No. Let me handle this.

686
01:04:50.538 --> 01:04:53.007
- Hold on.
- Don't.


687
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:54.375
Robbie...

688
01:04:56.377 --> 01:04:59.046
Okay. Come on.

689
01:04:59.079 --> 01:05:00.415
- No.
- Open your mouth.


690
01:05:00.448 --> 01:05:01.849
Stop.

691
01:05:01.882 --> 01:05:03.518
- Stop.
- Come on. Open your mouth.


692
01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:06.353
You have to let me finish this.

693
01:05:06.388 --> 01:05:10.190
Please. You can't be here.

694
01:05:10.224 --> 01:05:12.059
They will kill you.

695
01:05:12.092 --> 01:05:15.397
I'm not going to let you
die here alone.


696
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:18.600
Okay? Now, come on. Get up.

697
01:05:18.633 --> 01:05:23.203
Come on. Come on.

698
01:06:14.355 --> 01:06:18.359
Hey, baby. You okay?

699
01:06:18.393 --> 01:06:20.395
Robbie.

700
01:06:22.996 --> 01:06:24.599
He's in trouble.

701
01:06:24.632 --> 01:06:28.936
Tell us where they went.

702
01:06:40.147 --> 01:06:42.149
Come on.

703
01:06:57.465 --> 01:06:59.233
Robbie?

704
01:06:59.266 --> 01:07:00.635
I can't see.

705
01:07:00.668 --> 01:07:02.136
Anna?

706
01:07:04.138 --> 01:07:06.474
Anna?

707
01:07:08.008 --> 01:07:12.246
Anna, it's okay.

708
01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:14.416
It's okay.

709
01:07:23.658 --> 01:07:26.226
What are you doing here?

710
01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:28.530
Oh, my God. Run, Vanessa!

711
01:07:28.563 --> 01:07:30.432
Just stay calm.
We're here to help.


712
01:07:30.465 --> 01:07:32.266
Where's Anna?

713
01:07:32.299 --> 01:07:34.569
She didn't make it.

714
01:07:34.602 --> 01:07:36.438
You're lying.

715
01:07:36.471 --> 01:07:38.305
Just...

716
01:07:38.338 --> 01:07:41.443
Can you just please get in the
car and we'll take you home?


717
01:07:41.476 --> 01:07:43.478
Can you please get out of here?
Please?


718
01:07:43.511 --> 01:07:46.280
Listen to me.
You're under a spell.


719
01:07:46.313 --> 01:07:47.715
Will you go? Now!

720
01:07:47.749 --> 01:07:50.518
Please.

721
01:07:50.552 --> 01:07:52.587
You don't have to do this.

722
01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:54.689
You tell me where she is.

723
01:07:57.157 --> 01:07:58.693
I said she's dead!

724
01:07:58.726 --> 01:08:01.596
Okay.

725
01:08:01.629 --> 01:08:02.996
Robbie?

726
01:08:03.030 --> 01:08:04.632
Oh, my God.

727
01:08:07.067 --> 01:08:10.538
Watch closely. You did this.

728
01:08:14.241 --> 01:08:17.277
Don't.

729
01:08:17.311 --> 01:08:19.681
Robbie?

730
01:08:23.317 --> 01:08:27.388
Oh, my God. No.

731
01:08:27.422 --> 01:08:29.424
You see the mess he's made?

732
01:08:33.561 --> 01:08:35.630
Any ideas?

733
01:08:35.663 --> 01:08:37.799
Turn him.

734
01:08:37.832 --> 01:08:40.502
Anna bites Robbie. Robbie turns,

735
01:08:40.535 --> 01:08:43.237
and we all live
happily ever after.


736
01:08:45.105 --> 01:08:47.809
I can live with that.

737
01:08:47.842 --> 01:08:49.644
It's a pretty good deal, man.

738
01:08:49.677 --> 01:08:52.447
I don't want it.

739
01:08:52.480 --> 01:08:54.549
I'm talking about immortality.

740
01:08:54.582 --> 01:08:58.218
Look at me. I'm a god.

741
01:08:58.252 --> 01:09:01.456
No, you're not.

742
01:09:01.489 --> 01:09:03.257
Living forever
doesn't make you a god.


743
01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:05.827
It makes you less than human.

744
01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:08.429
Are you listening to this?

745
01:09:08.463 --> 01:09:10.632
I'm offering him the chance
to live forever,


746
01:09:10.665 --> 01:09:13.568
and he's too stupid
and weak to take it.


747
01:09:13.601 --> 01:09:15.837
I won't turn him.

748
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:19.239
Fine. Then kill him.

749
01:09:19.273 --> 01:09:21.275
Or we will.

750
01:09:25.513 --> 01:09:28.716
This is all my fault.

751
01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:32.185
You're going to die
because of me.


752
01:09:32.219 --> 01:09:34.121
I'm sorry.

753
01:09:34.154 --> 01:09:37.324
No. No, no. Don't be.

754
01:09:42.564 --> 01:09:44.566
You saved me.

755
01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:47.802
Okay?

756
01:09:50.237 --> 01:09:52.239
Anna?

757
01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.242
Anna?

758
01:10:01.649 --> 01:10:03.651
No. This can't be happening.

759
01:10:06.421 --> 01:10:08.423
How can she just be gone?

760
01:10:13.695 --> 01:10:15.697
Don't act like you care
about her.


761
01:10:19.366 --> 01:10:22.302
I did care.

762
01:10:22.336 --> 01:10:25.272
Quite a bit.

763
01:10:25.305 --> 01:10:28.308
But it doesn't really matter
now, does it?


764
01:10:31.579 --> 01:10:33.581
Just get on with it, then.

765
01:10:37.284 --> 01:10:40.755
If you're out to kill me,
then kill me!


766
01:10:40.788 --> 01:10:44.726
Do it!

767
01:10:50.263 --> 01:10:52.265
Let's go, Nina.

768
01:11:06.781 --> 01:11:09.784
Are you sure you don't want to
turn, honey?


769
01:11:09.817 --> 01:11:13.253
Travel the world? Get high?

770
01:11:13.286 --> 01:11:15.390
Live forever?

771
01:11:15.423 --> 01:11:17.692
I'm sure.

772
01:11:19.727 --> 01:11:22.563
Yeah. Well...

773
01:11:22.597 --> 01:11:24.599
...it's not all
it's cracked up to be.
