1
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.480
This is my "T".

2
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.390
My testosterone.

3
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.840
I'm on 250 milligram right now.

4
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.840
Guys...

5
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.130
Today is my 25th shot.

6
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.040
That's why I wanted
to share with you.


7
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.160
see I pull back a little bit
to get rid of the bubble,


8
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.100
then I wipe it,

9
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.100
then I slap it,
like this...


10
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.350
and then...

11
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.450
ROMEOS

12
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.460
- It was a misunderstanding.
- A "misunderstanding"?


13
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.530
Lukas was placed in the
girl’s dorms by mistake.


14
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.470
- Do I look like a girl?
- The men's dorms are full.


15
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.660
- So, I have to stay here?
- Lukas stays 'til this is sorted.


16
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.170
- Can you cope for now?
- Ms. Kampmann, I can't stay!


17
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.490
We will put up a notice for
new arrivals.


18
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.520
Lukas, although our first meeting
didn't go especially well,


19
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.530
We're happy that you're
joining our team,


20
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.580
so welcome to your civilian
service year in Ehrenfeld.


21
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.710
Could you please tell the others?
Lukas, a moment please.


22
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.600
- I'm sorry about this.
- What do you mean there's no room?


23
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.920
- It wasn't approved.
- What? I thought it would be fine.


24
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.490
- I'll speak with them again, OK?
- When will you?


25
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.030
- When I get an appointment.
- Hello.


26
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.130
They're all very nice here.
Ine, shouldn't you be working?


27
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.760
- Do it now or it'll take forever.
- I just wanted to say hello.


28
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.950
- Ine, it's ten past.
- I'm not gonna stay here.


29
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.850
- I'll take care of it.
- Ms. Kampmann, please.


30
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.620
I promise.

31
00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.980
- Ine?
- Yeah.


32
00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.110
Get a move on, girls.

33
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.600
Crazy! This is crazy!

34
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.260
- Yeah crazy.
- Your voice!


35
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.500
- Ine are you coming?
- Yes. Everything. Crazy!


36
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.680
Ine, come please.
-Yes!


37
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.590
Shit, I gotta go.
Oh, God...


38
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.200
- There's a party tonight. Are you coming?
- Sure.


39
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.540
I'm glad you're here.

40
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.690
Ine?
-All right!


41
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.270
Two...

42
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.340
One...

43
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.660
Zero...

44
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.370
Legs, biceps

45
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.960
- It's me. Are you coming?
- Yes.


46
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:53.430
- Hurry up.
- Ok.


47
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:58.580
- What are you waiting for?
- Oh.


48
00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.160
"Oh" what?

49
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.770
- I'm hurrying.
- You better. I got us a lift.


50
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:10.210
What do you think?
If I don't pull tonight, I'll go mad.


51
00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.190
Look. Good, right?

52
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.280
You've got so much armpit hair!

53
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.710
Yeah. We're coming.

54
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:31.410
Yeah, we're leaving now,
see you in a second.


55
00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.100
Let's go.

56
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.170
God, fuck!

57
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.610
"Biceps, stomach, legs, arse?"

58
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.450
- You measure your arse?
- Of course.


59
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.170
-Isn't that a little over the top?
-No.


60
00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.220
- Come on, we've got to go!

61
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:03.220
- What's better, open or closed?

62
00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:06.050
- Both are good.

63
00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.710
It's just a party.
We look good.


64
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.270
- Is this OK? I'm freaking out.
- Yes! We have to leave.


65
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.890
- You didn't tell anyone did you?
- No.


66
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.180
- Come on.
- You swear?


67
00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:22.470
Yes.

68
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.840
- You look good.
- Really?


69
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.740
Yes, now come on!

70
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.910
- We've got a lift. Come on!
- I am coming.


71
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.340
- Hello, you're there.

72
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:41.450
- You're coming with us?
- Yes.


73
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.850

75
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:59.360
- Great, and you?
- Hurry! Come on! Let's go!


76
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.660
- We'll talk later, OK?
- Can you wait a minute?


77
00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.130
- It's on the left.
- Let's talk later, OK?


78
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.060
- We can...
- Bye.


79
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.450
- Who are you?
- You said that we could bring...


80
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.630
- It's so nice of you.
- Yeah, great.


81
00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.080
- Yeah, thank you.
- It's not my fault!


82
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.890
Ine, asked to come.
Now there are five of us.


83
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.730
- Are you crazy? Get back inside!
- It's fun.


84
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:20.830
- No one's getting off in my car, OK?
- All right, we didn't know.


85
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.870
Sheesh.

86
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.120
- Hey! Get out. You can walk!
- Calm down!


87
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:40.240
- What's the problem?
- Nobody is getting off in my car.


88
00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:41.970
I'm serious guys!

89
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.430
What's up?

90
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.990
Here we go. Come on!

91
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.470
I'm watching you.

92
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.210
Now!

93
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.290
- Yeah!
- Yes!


94
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.440
How old are you guys?

95
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:17.400
- Women just don't get it!
- Yeah, yeah.


96
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.960
- Hi, I'm Fabio.
- Lukas.


97
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.910
- Thanks for the lift.
- No worries.


98
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.580
- Yeah, thanks for the lift. Bye bye.

99
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:49.790
Are we going or not?

100
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.440
- I'm not coming. I'm going home.
- Are you crazy?


101
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.960
- My jacket is too tight.
- No, it isn't. You look good. Vamos!


102
00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.220
Hey.

103
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.220
So, is she looking?

104
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:49.890
Yes. No, not anymore.
Wait, she is.


105
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.740
She's gone.

106
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.650
Those girls are looking at us.

107
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.560
- No, they're looking at you.
- Think they're together?


108
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.820
Not so obvious!

109
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.330
- Let's look for one for you.
- No, don't.


110
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:16.630
Just for a snog.

111
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.280
Have a go with her.

112
00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.880
- No.
- Why not? She's your type.


113
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.500
No. You can have her.

114
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.950
- Are you crazy?
- Careful!


115
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.230
That chick.

116
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.990
- What a bitch.
- Hey necklace was ugly anyway.


117
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.070
Ok, retards, it's time to party!

118
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.350
The alpha male. To us!

119
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.620
Cheers!

120
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:49.110
The way he looks.

121
00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.080
What you're lacking in manliness,
he has too much of.


122
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.540
Come on. To us. Cheers!

123
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.030
Sorry. Occupied!

124
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.310
I'm sorry.

125
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.530
Shit... Shit...

126
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.360
Shit!

127
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.480
- You're back?
- What? I didn't go anywhere.


128
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.140
- Neither did I.
- What's up with you?


129
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.660
Nothing.

130
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.630
- You're acting weird.
- No, everything's just great.


131
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.890
- Hey, Sven, how you doing?
- Great party, yeah?


132
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:12.760
Guys, you have to see this!
It's totally mad!


133
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:16.670
- What's going on?
- Hey, where did you guys meet?


134
00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.150
- I can't see anything, can you?
- No. What's going on?


135
00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.910
- Let's check it out.
- No, Ine, don't. No!


136
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:26.710
- What?
- So, who's cock is this?


137
00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:31.170
- Whose cock is this?
- I found it on the bathtub.


138
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.520
Come on! Whose is this cock?

139
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.580
It's yours?! Take it!
Admit it! Admit it, man!


140
00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:43.500
Sven, is it yours? 
Go on, admit it!

141
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:49.720
Svennie! Svennie!

142
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.840
Stop it! It's not even funny!

143
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.100
Sven, give it here. 
This isn't funny!

144
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.960
Sve, give me the fucking penis man!

145
00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:01.250
Total retards!

146
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.190
Hey, Lukas, you all right?

147
00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.000
My neck... It's cramped in there.

148
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:25.570
- Waiting for someone?
- Nobody.


149
00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:29.760
- So what are you doing here?
- Chilling.


150
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.540
- Nothing happening up there?
- Nah, not really.


151
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.650
Wait a second.

152
00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:49.020
Very funny...

153
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:55.110
Total retards.

154
00:18:57.420 --> 00:18:59.440
There were three of you in there?

155
00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.310
My balls ache.
All they were doing is snogging.


156
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.830
Totally annoying man,
you know what I mean?


157
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.690
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, it was good anyway.


158
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:27.430
Hold this for a second.

159
00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.540
Hey, the disabled home where you live...

160
00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.240
- What is it?
- It's not a disabled home.


161
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.780
I'm doing my civilian service there.

162
00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:46.080
- You're new here?
- Yep.


163
00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.620
To Cologne and everything.

164
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.120
Sweet jacket.

165
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:05.270
Can I try it on?

166
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.060
Hand it over.

167
00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:11.440
Come on...

168
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:15.580
Don't be like that. 
Give it to me.

169
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.380
- Well?
- It's Ok.


170
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:38.290
- What then? Ok or really good?
- Really good.


171
00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:45.610
- Are you cold?
- No. Why?


172
00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.930
You're sitting as if you are.

173
00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.570
Just give me my jacket, Ok?

174
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.270
Try and take it.

175
00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:05.780
- Shit! Fabio?
- Come on!


176
00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.930
Fabio, I swear...

177
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:16.150
- Come and get it!
- Fabio! Shit!


178
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.140
Come on! Come!

179
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:25.120
Fabio! Wait!

180
00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.220
Fuck!

181
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.400
Do you have problems sleeping?

182
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.190
I don't know if it's my T

183
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.210
but dreams they keep me up
all night.


184
00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.450
Some really really scary sort of dreams
makes me not want to go to sleep.


185
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.310
So you guys on T

186
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.500
please beg me with your experience.

187
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.590
I'm sure I'm not alone
I'm sure you have the same feelings.


188
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.040
You know what I thought
when I cut it out

189
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.890
it would be off my chest and
I would try to work on it better.


190
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:45.460
Okay, whatever, hopefully I'll
update again soon.


191
00:22:45.790 --> 00:22:49.010
Hopefully then it's a very happy update.

192
00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:57.170
Three...

193
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.000
Two...

194
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.210
One...

195
00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:41.640
- Everyone saw.
- Girls, make yourselves decent.


196
00:23:49.450 --> 00:23:53.040
Thank you.
Put all this in the fridge.


197
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:07.560
- Shit.
- Good God!


198
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.980
Give it to me.

199
00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.290
Give me your hand.

200
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.260
- Why?
- Give me your hand.


201
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.230
- Why?
- Give me it.


202
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:32.620
- Are you crazy!
- Try to get away! No!


203
00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:46.600
I know. I acted stupid
last night at the party.


204
00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:49.230
I'm sorry. Honestly.

205
00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:59.900
Miri, you're a little smelly.

206
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.350
- My name is Lukas.
- OK, but you still smell sweaty.


207
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:09.250
Manly sweat. Isn't that great?

208
00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.520
It's Ok now, but you
would've passed out a year ago.


209
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:17.490
- Ine, you should've seen it!
- I wanted to.


210
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:22.560
- I was a little distant.
- A little?


211
00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:43.560
They are thicker.

212
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.200
Ms. Leonhard, I have to admit

213
00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:11.660
I thought that you would
look differently.


214
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:17.540
The current changing room situation
for you is unbearable.


215
00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:22.850
You wrote: "I receive
uncomfortable looks everywhere..."


216
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:28.030
Mr. Boeken, Lukas is the only boy
at a nurses' station.


217
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:31.770
The girls are curious. The situation is
embarrassing for everyone.


218
00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:37.590
But they know that Miss Leonhard,
Lukas, is a girl.


219
00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:41.110
- Can't they just accept her?
- They don't know how to.


220
00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.100
I'm not a girl. I am a FTM.

221
00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.550
- "Female to male."
- Female to male.


222
00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.770
I wrote everything down for you.

223
00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.530
- "Gender identity disorder."
- Yes. - Transsexuality.


224
00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.650
Will you approve the request?
Yes or no?


225
00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:02.970
This is still about housing a
female in a males dorm.


226
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.700
The decision can not be taken lightly.

227
00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.170
- My name's been changed.
- It says here that you are female.


228
00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.870
Because I still have ovaries?
Yes.


229
00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:17.570
- So I am officially a man if...
- How much is the operation?


230
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:24.000
- A lot but state insurance covers it.
- Really? Health insurance covers that?


231
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.170
- Did you know Ms. Kampmann?
- Didn't you?


232
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:35.230
I mean, you can't even tell.
Well done. Remarkable.


233
00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:42.820
- Can I ask you a small question?
- Will you approve the transfer? Yes or no?


234
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:47.890
Ms. Kampmann, l'll take such
a request into consideration.


235
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.910
I'll check everything over again,

236
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.510
but now that I've seen Miss Leonhard,
and she's left a good impression on me...


237
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.520
Come on, Lukas, we're leaving.

238
00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:03.120
- Super. Thanks!
- We have to find his weak point.


239
00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.820
- What am I supposed to do now?
- Fight.


240
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.830
I can't believe it,

241
00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.230
So... Drains... Flat...

242
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:29.850
Here look on the left side,
on this side you can see the scar.


243
00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:33.250
Still very swollen.
But it'll fade.


244
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.130
Can I ask you something?

245
00:28:43.790 --> 00:28:45.760
I mean, down there...

246
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:50.650
I don't know if it's my T, my
hormones or the fucking steroids,


247
00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.760
but do you know what it's like to have
a permanent hard on?


248
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:23.990
Hey, what's it like in your dorm?

249
00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:29.080
Super. The boys are really great!
Really amazing.


250
00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:33.540
Why are you in the girls dorms?

251
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:37.670
Hey, Marcus, what's up? Up for
going out for a drink later?


252
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:40.970
Sure, absolutely. Great!

253
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.360
Do you want to come too?

254
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.210
Come with us. See you then!

255
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.150
- Give me the sherry.
- Just a second.


256
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:24.750
Thanks.
Ine, want to go out tonight?


257
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.960
No.

258
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.240
Ine, please.

259
00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:38.850
Do it for me, please.

260
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.470
Little big, isn't it?

261
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.850
Can I go like this?

262
00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.300
- My dearest. For you.
- Thanks.


263
00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.050
- He's annoying. Let's go soon, Ok?
- Yeah, Ok.


264
00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:15.230
- Thanks again for coming.
- Sure.


265
00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.940
To us.

266
00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.070
Hey guys.

267
00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:23.600
- How are you?
- Good, you?


268
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.450
Hey ladies, you all right?

269
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.480
Shit.

270
00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.590
Look who's here.
Is he wearing your jacket?


271
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:46.210
- I lent it to him.
- To him? When was that?


272
00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.730
- Hey, it's your turn.
- Hold this. Hold this.


273
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.070
Shit! Fuck!

274
00:31:57.570 --> 00:32:00.110
You're such a poof, man.

275
00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:04.170
- You play like a fairy.
- You are a fairy. Look at you!


276
00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.740
One to one.

277
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.690
- Ok, let's go.
- What?


278
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:15.850
How about a deciding game?

279
00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.610
Go play it from over there.

280
00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.410
What are you waiting for?

281
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:43.570
- I thought we were going.
- Ine, please, just this game.


282
00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.300
- Move over?
- Come on, play!


283
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:55.090
Shit! We're losing, you idiot.

284
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.220
Fuck you man! Think I didn't see you?

285
00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:50.480
You flirt with my girl,
You'll be on the floor!


286
00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.780
- Understand?.
- I didn't do anything.


287
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.550
- You were staring, you arsehole!
- You're the arsehole!


288
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.910
Calm down, Massimo.
Take it easy!


289
00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.500
- He's coming onto my girlfriend!
- No he isn't.


290
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:09.260
- Do you know him?
- No.


291
00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:16.870
Fine. I want a big apology
from you now.


292
00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:20.180
- Go on.
- Just leave it?


293
00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.040
I apologize. Sorry, scusi,
excuse me. Happy now?


294
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:30.150
You got lucky.

295
00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:37.350
- Could you please move aside.
- "Could you please move aside."


296
00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.040
What a fairy, man.

297
00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:52.760
- Hit it from the side.
- Shut up.


298
00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.620
Great!

299
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:06.430
It was just luck.

300
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.490
What now?

301
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.490
Are you coming?

302
00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:30.710
- Where to?
- To have a bit of fun.


303
00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:35.800
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.


304
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.200
Come on.

305
00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:44.380
Come on!

306
00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.470
- How's it going?
- Good. You?


307
00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.060
Isn't it great here.
Absolutely amazing! Totally raging.


308
00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.930
- What did you take?
- He looks so good!


309
00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.130
- Who?
- Fabio, of course.


310
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.180
You look good too.

311
00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.960
Look after yourself, OK?
Let me tell you something.


312
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:44.050
He might fuck well,
but there's nothing else.


313
00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:46.980
Some guys are better left alone.

314
00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.720
Hey, where have you been?

315
00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:01.320
- Fabio, I can't.
- Sure you can.


316
00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:10.350
- Fabio, we're moving too fast.
- Fast?


317
00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.000
Last night was so cool.

318
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:51.640
Ine, guess where I
went yesterday. Come on.


319
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:54.450
I went to Men Only.

320
00:39:56.410 --> 00:39:58.280
Ine, isn't that amazing?

321
00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:01.230
You know what?

322
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:04.120
"Please, please,
Don't leave me alone. "


323
00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:07.610
I didn't see you anywhere.

324
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:10.190
You are so into yourself.

325
00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:13.500
You wouldn't have got in anyway.
Girls aren't allowed in.


326
00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.830
- You two look really rough.
- So do you.


327
00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:21.520
Do you know what they said?
What they think of me?


328
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.100
You have a huge hickey.

329
00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.850
- Who was it?
- Only if you stop to being cross.


330
00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.270
- It doesn't bother him?
- What bother whom?


331
00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:49.920
Nothing.

332
00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:52.840
Guess what they think of me.

333
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:56.600
Guess what Sven and others
said to me.


334
00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:00.620
- I have no idea. Nice?
- No.


335
00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.450
- Interesting?
- Good looking!


336
00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:08.310
Ine, Sven thinks I'm good looking.
They all do!


337
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:12.240
- How do you guys know eachother?
- From school. Satisfied?


338
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:16.110
- Is he your ex?
- No, my best girlfriend.


339
00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.250
Is he gay?

340
00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:25.170
When can I move to the men's dormitory?

341
00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:28.390
- Hello, first of all.
- Have you apologized?


342
00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:31.200
- So I can get approval?

343
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:34.240
No, and I'm not going to.

344
00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:40.140
But there are loads of free rooms!

345
00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:44.540
Lukas, I promised I will talk about that,
but there are other important things.


346
00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:46.910
- Like what?
- Excuse me?


347
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.290
I hate having to give every
tiny detail.


348
00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:54.320
My name, my new passport,
whether or not I take my testosterone.


349
00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:58.280
I needed five signatures just to
get out of fucking physical surveillance.


350
00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:00.180
It's always the same questions.

351
00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.660
And now when all I need is for you to
suck up a little, you won't.


352
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:09.380
- That's right.
- Why not?


353
00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.680
Miss Kampmann, please.

354
00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:18.090
- I understand it's difficult for you.
- I'm not a girl. I don't belong here!


355
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.740
I know, but you can't force things.

356
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:17.680
- Let's go swimming.
- No, I do not have time.


357
00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.220
Oh, come on.

358
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:23.820
Is everything Okay?

359
00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:32.130
Lukas was at the window.

360
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:59.330
- Fabio, your family's here.
- What?


361
00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.720
- Over there, look!
- Where?


362
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:04.490
- Over there, next to the tree.
- Where?


363
00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:11.550
He's a big man out here, but he'd get
his arse kicked if Mama found out


364
00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:16.490
how many strangers' arses
he'd stuck his cock up.


365
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.150
You arse.

366
00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:23.190
Do you think it's winter?

367
00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:26.750
Ditch your clothes and get a tan.
What's wrong?


368
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:30.030
- I have a sun allergy.
- Sun allergy?


369
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.870
- So, you're handicapped.
- No!


370
00:44:34.340 --> 00:44:36.290
Stop it! Fabio!

371
00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.930
- Who wants water?
- Bitch!


372
00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:46.860
Just eleven more weeks,
then these things are off at last.


373
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:49.370
I am so happy.

374
00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:53.010
- Afterward, just a small scar...
- Have you lost your mind!


375
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:56.800
Lukas, come on in! 
Don't be like that!

376
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:59.670
- No thanks.
- Come on!


377
00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.980
Fabio's always looking at us.

378
00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:10.960
He's looking at me.

379
00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:14.710
He looks so good.

380
00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:18.810
Are you jealous?

381
00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.960
It's so unfair.

382
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:27.230
What's going on between you two?

383
00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.020
- Is he into you?
- Yes.


384
00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.070
I think so.

385
00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.840
Look! Look, now!

386
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:43.520
Not so obvious.
There, did you see that?


387
00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.490
- Have you told him?
- Of course not.


388
00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:59.530
He's going to figure it out eventually
anyway.


389
00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:11.660
If you like boys anyway,
then stay a girl. It would be easier.


390
00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.040
Are you crazy?

391
00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.410
Why put yourself through all this?

392
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:21.190
One thing has absolutely nothing to
do with the other.


393
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:23.950
You're just jealous.

394
00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.900
Just because you're not the center
of attention and I am.


395
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:42.110
- Miri, I don't know who you are.
- Listen to me!


396
00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:44.970
Can you just call me Lukas, please!

397
00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.840
- Miri doesn't exist anymore.
- Too bad.


398
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:51.630
You can't stand me not following you!
Miri was shit!


399
00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.640
No, she wasn't!

400
00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:57.660
Lukas! Come on!

401
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:59.980
Look, they all think I'm great.

402
00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:04.310
They don't know who you are yet.

403
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:08.970
No! No!

404
00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:36.240
No!

405
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.070
No!
Go away!


406
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:52.220
You have such a rod up your arse!

407
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:57.780
Fabio, wait!

408
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.620
- Thanks for the lift.
- No problem.


409
00:49:26.850 --> 00:49:28.950
What's wrong with you, man?

410
00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:39.630
Nothing.

411
00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.110
Hey! My jacket!

412
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.000
- Minnie Mouse!
- Happy birthday!


413
00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:18.590
- Don't worry. He's always late.
- Hey.


414
00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:23.370
- Lukas!
- Miriam, finally!


415
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:27.030
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.


416
00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:31.080
- Hi, Dad.
- Happy birthday.


417
00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.880
You're soaking wet. 
What happened?

418
00:50:35.370 --> 00:50:39.670
- Lukas, where are you?
- I'll be right back! Wait for me!


419
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:42.630
Lukas! My mobile! My keys!

420
00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:46.090
Don't take another step!
I'll get your things! Wait there!


421
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:51.310
- Layla, take that off now. Take it off!
- I don't want to.


422
00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.650
- Where's the other stuff?
- I hid them.


423
00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.790
Lukas, I'm sick of this!

424
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.010
Let's play our little lying game.
Do you remember how we played?


425
00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:12.130
- So, am I your brother or your sister?
- My brother.


426
00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:16.010
- If someone asks my name, you say?
- Lukas. He's dumb...


427
00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.240
You're pissing me off, man!

428
00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:22.470
- My brother's dumb!
- That's true, totally dumb.


429
00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:24.520
- Here's your jacket!
- The rest?


430
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:27.480
- I'm looking for it.
- I hid it.


431
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:30.190
- Layla, where are his things?
- I hid them!


432
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.340
- And who are you?
- Minnie Mouse.


433
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:35.070
- Is that chewing gum?
- Yes.


434
00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.140
- OK.
- Cool.


435
00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:43.250
Give me your gum.
I'll show you a trick. Spit it out.


436
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.060
- Cool!
- There!


437
00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.690
Here's everything.
Come on, you've gotta go.


438
00:51:57.880 --> 00:51:59.420
- Ciao, Minnie Mouse.
- No!


439
00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:02.930
Do some more magic!
I don't want you to go!


440
00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:04.510
- Shut up!
- Stupid cow!


441
00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:06.110
- Get out!
- What is wrong with you?!


442
00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.380
- I hate you and your stupid secret!
- Quiet!


443
00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:11.680
- Lukas is a girl! Lukas is a girl!
- Shut your mouth!


444
00:52:11.890 --> 00:52:15.410
- Don't talk to her like that!
- Miri's lying! She's a she, not a he!


445
00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:20.720
Nobody's supposed to know that she
takes medicine to become a boy!


446
00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:25.020
That's why I have to lie and tell
everyone she's my brother!


447
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.370
- Are you crazy! Stop it!

448
00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.780
- Have you lost your mind, Miri?

449
00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.560
Get lost!

450
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:50.740
Just the two of us.

451
00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:57.150
What huge thighs I had back then.

452
00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:35.550
Three.

453
00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:40.900
Two.

454
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:47.530
One.

455
00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:21.700
- Anything exciting happening?
- Not really.


456
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:24.170
- Hi.
- And you?


457
00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:30.520
No, nothing special.
We're doing something tonight.


458
00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:33.780
Come with us, Lukas.
Ine told me everything.


459
00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:42.500
You and Fabio are over. What an arse.
You should be happy. Really.


460
00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:47.670
Shall we go? Are you coming, Lukas?

461
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:52.090
- No, I'm staying in.
- It's good to distract yourself.


462
00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:54.360
You can come with us.

463
00:56:55.700 --> 00:56:59.990
OK, bye. Call me if you need anything.

464
00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.600
Can I come in?

465
00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.010
- Was my application rejected?
- Yes.


466
00:58:02.090 --> 00:58:03.400
But...

467
00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.060
Let's do this.

468
00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:15.110
Nobody will check and the
porters know.


469
00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.530
Thank you.

470
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:27.490
But I'm warning you, it's not as nice
over there as it is here.


471
00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:36.160
- What's all this?
- Applications.


472
00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:42.690
Do you have good doctors?

473
00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.120
I hope so.

474
00:58:49.300 --> 00:58:53.700
- You know you can always come back.
- No.


475
00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:57.130
Never.

476
00:58:59.810 --> 00:59:01.640
I have to go.

477
00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:07.950
What do you think?
Like this or like this?


478
00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.620
Like that.

479
00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:19.460
- Do you have a date?
- It's Saturday night.


480
00:59:57.250 --> 00:59:58.660
Let me make this clear.

481
00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:01.360
I don't like trannies, OK?

482
01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:05.650
- I'm not a tranny. I just...
- Yeah, right. Bullshit!


483
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.420
Let's clear some things up!
First, don't touch me!


484
01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:12.770
And second, who knows?

485
01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.090
- Ine?
- Yes.


486
01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.050
Who else? Sven? 
Sven's boyfriend?

487
01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.040
- No, of course not.
- Thank God. Let's keep it that way.


488
01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:30.950
- No one needs to know that you're a girl!
- I'm not a girl!


489
01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:34.610
I don't want anyone like Sven having
a go at me.


490
01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.440
Deal?

491
01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.820
Hey, Lukas! You came.

492
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.160
- What did he want?
- Nothing special.


493
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:49.980
- Having problems? Is it over?
- It's not that bad.


494
01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:54.250
- Typical Fabio.
- Let's have a drink, Lukas.


495
01:00:54.970 --> 01:00:58.740
The important thing is to tell
everyone that you finished it.


496
01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:00.740
Otherwise, your reputation is gone.

497
01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.730
Find someone else.
There are plenty of guys around.


498
01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:13.130
- What are you having?
- A beer.


499
01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:19.970
- Beer?
- Sure.


500
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:24.360
- Excuse me.
- What do you think is under her dress?


501
01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:30.140
- I'm not sure.
- Think he'll really cut his dick off?


502
01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:32.910
- Yes.
- No. You can't cut your own dick off.


503
01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:38.210
First they cut off the balls and
then they pull the glands down.


504
01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:44.840
Is that something for you, Fabio?
Make you a pussy? With a little clit?


505
01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.380
- Each to their own.
- I bet.


506
01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:53.690
- If they only knew who was
standing next to me. Crazy!


507
01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.370
Tell me...

508
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.130
Will you have a cock?

509
01:02:02.330 --> 01:02:05.240
- Is that even possible?
- Of course it is.


510
01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:14.890
What do you have down there?

511
01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:23.870
- Can you fall pregnant?
- Why don't you look on the internet?!


512
01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:28.460
- It's explained in full there!
- Sorry. It's just so crazy.


513
01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:34.340
What's so wrong with me that
nothing ever works out?


514
01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:38.480
Why can't things just work out
for me, without all the shit,


515
01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.490
the stress and all the psychos?

516
01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:45.070
Why does everything always have to
be so hard for me?


517
01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:48.270
- What's wrong?
- She doesn't know if she loves me.


518
01:02:48.490 --> 01:02:49.760
Oh...

519
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:53.070
You don't have to think about it.
You feel it!


520
01:02:57.730 --> 01:03:00.660
- You've become so self-centered.
- What?


521
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.540
You're not even listening to me,
You arse!


522
01:03:03.720 --> 01:03:05.640
If she says she doesn't know,

523
01:03:05.850 --> 01:03:09.740
it's still better than saying she
doesn't love you at all.


524
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:33.760
<i>I am a poor wayfaring stranger</i>

525
01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:42.520
<i>I'm travelling through
this world of woe</i>


526
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:51.550
<i>yet there's no sickness, toil
nor danger</i>


527
01:03:52.340 --> 01:04:00.270
<i>in that bright world, in which I go.</i>

528
01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:09.670
<i>I'm going there to see my father,</i>

529
01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:18.160
<i>I'm going there, no more to roam</i>

530
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:26.690
<i>I'm only going over Jordan</i>

531
01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:35.990
<i>I'm only going over home.</i>

532
01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:45.880
<i>I know dark clouds, will gather around me</i>

533
01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:54.450
<i>I know my way is rough and steep,</i>

534
01:04:55.370 --> 01:05:04.380
<i>but golden fields lie out before me</i>

535
01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:13.770
<i>where God's redeemed, shall ever sleep.</i>

536
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:34.260
- Where should we go tonight?
- The Italian place.


537
01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:46.920
- Hey, can you clean my room too?

538
01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:51.780
- Need an apron?
- Not today.


539
01:07:53.850 --> 01:07:56.490
Ask him if he wants some too.

540
01:07:58.110 --> 01:08:01.900
- You want a noodle?

541
01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:22.380
- You all right?
- Yes.


542
01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.700
- What's that? What is it?
- None of your business.


543
01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:29.090
- What's wrong? Why are you running?
- Why? Can't you keep up?


544
01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:30.880
Of course, you retard.

545
01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:35.110
- Are you taking tablets?
- Give them here.


546
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:37.770
- Do they give you muscles?
- Bigger than yours.


547
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:41.450
- Give them to me.
- No, are you crazy?


548
01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:51.770
Come on!

549
01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.280
Hey, all right?

550
01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:15.880
No.

551
01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:19.200
OK, you?

552
01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.150
Ok, see you soon.

553
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:31.190
My date. I have to go. Ciao.

554
01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:14.090
I was looking for Ine but
I can't find her.


555
01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:20.440
Something terrible has happened.

556
01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:38.750
Guys are shits.

557
01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.640
Twenty four SMS messages.

558
01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:48.170
I thought I'd just take a look and
there were twenty four SMS messages.


559
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:53.300
It's strange, right? He said he
needed a second mobile for work.


560
01:11:54.910 --> 01:11:57.350
It's been going on for three weeks.

561
01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:00.230
He says he loves me.

562
01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:02.160
Guys are shits.

563
01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:05.640
It's all behind me now.

564
01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:09.500
- Being alone is much better.
- Absolutely.


565
01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.600
- No stress, no worries...
- To being alone!


566
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.580
To being alone!

567
01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:23.280
- Guys are shits.
- Fabio's a shit.


568
01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:27.670
- And your shitty boyfriend.
- Shitty ex-boyfriend.


569
01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:40.740
Fight, Sven, fight!

570
01:12:41.450 --> 01:12:43.730
- With you!
- With you!


571
01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.300
You're really sweet, Lukas.

572
01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:10.560
- Sven, I can't.
- Of course you can. Why not?


573
01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.970
I just can't.

574
01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:15.710
- Come on.
- Sven, I'm trans.


575
01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:20.700
- Trans?
- Transsexual.


576
01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:26.800
Transsexual?

577
01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:31.890
- What? You want tits?
- No, I want to get rid of them.


578
01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.050
Whatever.

579
01:14:51.630 --> 01:14:55.970
- I've never fucked a tranny, come on!
- Stop! Get off!


580
01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.020
- I'll stick it in the front.
- Stop! Stop!


581
01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:03.910
Fuck off! Fuck off!

582
01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.440
Get out now!

583
01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.140
I said no!

584
01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.650
Cunt!

585
01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:28.730
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.


586
01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.690
Are you messed up?

587
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:38.090
- No. You?
- No. why?


588
01:16:41.690 --> 01:16:43.770
I have something for you.

589
01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:48.140
It was your birthday, wasn't it?

590
01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:19.750
Ok, it's second hand, but I
thought maybe you could use it.


591
01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:39.060
- Totally Weak.
- Use that one.


592
01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:51.570
- Still weak.
- Do it on the side.


593
01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:53.940
Is it for the shoulder?

594
01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:14.600
What are you looking at? Triceps.

595
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.030
And you should do it too.

596
01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:32.680
Keep your shoulders straight and put
your elbows up a little higher.


597
01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.670
- Like this?
- Yes.


598
01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.530
Come on. Do a couple more.

599
01:18:47.450 --> 01:18:49.250
Come on.

600
01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:57.840
That's good.

601
01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:03.430
Not bad.

602
01:19:30.550 --> 01:19:33.650
Aren't you guys sweet!

603
01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:38.260
- Romeo and Juliet!
- You're asking to be hit.


604
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:45.990
Oh my God!

605
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:56.440
Fabio, wait!

606
01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.160
Shit! Fuck!

607
01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:04.650
Shit.

608
01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:10.120
- Are you Ok?
- Yes, everything's ok, Lukas.


609
01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:12.980
- Let me see.
- Leave me alone!


610
01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:17.740
- What is it?
- Miri, you make me sick as Lukas!


611
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:21.610
- It wasn't on purpose..
- That's not what I meant. Got it?


612
01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:27.040
- You don't listen to or care about me.
It's always, trans, trans, trans!


613
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:32.320
- Sorry, I...
- Friends take care of eachother!


614
01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.930
I have to wonder if we are
still friends!


615
01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:06.600
Fuck!

616
01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.510
Fabio, it's me.

617
01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:25.530
- Fabio, I'm tired of...
- Yes? Hello?


618
01:21:26.760 --> 01:21:30.250
I'm sorry. I thought Fabio lived here.

619
01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:35.090
- Yes, he does. Who are you?
- I'm Lukas, a friend of Fabio's.


620
01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:39.050
Come in, please, come in.

621
01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:44.540
- I'll come back.
- No, no, no. Fabio's home. Come in.


622
01:21:45.970 --> 01:21:48.120
Fabio never brings friends home.

623
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:51.880
Just a moment please.

624
01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:13.610
- Fabio, I...
- Get out!


625
01:22:14.690 --> 01:22:17.120
Fabio, I had no
idea you lived at home!

626
01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.590
I never want to see you again!

627
01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.600
- I'm sick of you!
- Me too!


628
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:28.630
- Well, that's perfect then!
- Yeah!


629
01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.050
- I've deleted you.
- I deleted you too!


630
01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.710
- Good.
- Yeah.


631
01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:15.160
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


632
01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:30.670
- Can I have a drag?
- Sure.


633
01:23:30.850 --> 01:23:32.300
Thank you.

634
01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.330
They found out about me,
about my situation,


635
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:48.580
were making fun of me.

636
01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:53.040
So I will look like this.
Like a piece of shit!


637
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:57.580
You know, I don't want
to go on like this.

638
01:25:58.060 --> 01:26:00.400
I just want to make a break.

639
01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:04.410
...wanna be free.

640
01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:19.030
Hey. It's me.

641
01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:23.420
Be strong Chester.
I'm here for you.


642
01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.970
I wish I could meet you someday.

643
01:26:30.190 --> 01:26:34.290
Keep fighting my friend. 
Keep fighting!

644
01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:42.900
Who's there?

645
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:54.190
How are you?

646
01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:00.950
And you?

647
01:27:07.770 --> 01:27:09.950
Ready for a rematch?

648
01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:20.620
- Come on.
- Ine, no.


649
01:27:23.230 --> 01:27:24.570
We challenge you.

650
01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:27.570
- You can't.
- Yes we can.


651
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:30.110
- No.
- We can play together.


652
01:27:30.330 --> 01:27:33.280
- We don't have any time.
- Please, baby.


653
01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:36.930
- You don't know how to play.
- But I want to learn!


654
01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:40.010
Please, I want to stay.

655
01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:44.450
- This is Jacqueline.
- Hi. I'm Ine and this is Lukas.


656
01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:48.620
- We're going.
- We'll come with you.


657
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:51.270
No, baby, please.

658
01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.930
- What are the teams?
- I want to play with one of the boys,


659
01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:59.530
because I'm just learning, so
it's hard for me.


660
01:27:59.710 --> 01:28:01.170
Ok, I understand.

661
01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.250
- Just one game though.
- One game.


662
01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.530
One game.

663
01:28:13.420 --> 01:28:15.230
Shit.

664
01:28:22.290 --> 01:28:26.750
Yes! Very good.
That’s the way it's done.


665
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:29.790
- You can have another shot.
- Exactly.


666
01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:34.410
That's the way!

667
01:28:35.940 --> 01:28:39.180
- I don't believe it!
- Not bad.


668
01:28:39.420 --> 01:28:43.870
Baby, this is for you, so you're not
too sad that I'm so good.


669
01:28:51.570 --> 01:28:55.870
- Damn.
- See? You can't always win.


670
01:29:07.060 --> 01:29:08.520
Shit!

671
01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:23.040
Cute, isn't he?

672
01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:26.440
It's still really new between
Fabio and me.


673
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:31.430
And what about you and Lukas?
How long have you been together?


674
01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:37.040
- We're not together.
- Crazy. Is he your ex?


675
01:29:37.290 --> 01:29:40.370
Nope. I'm a lesbian.

676
01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:46.480
Girls, can you give the chat a rest?
It's your turn.


677
01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:53.130
- We won!
- Rematch. Rematch.


678
01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:56.870
- Baby, shouldn't we go soon?
- Just one game. Ok, babe?


679
01:29:57.190 --> 01:29:59.080
- New teams.
- Baby, one more.


680
01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:03.310
- Ok, new teams. Who's playing with me?
- Me.


681
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:45.310
