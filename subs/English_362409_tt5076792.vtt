1
00:01:10.874 --> 00:01:14.539
For as long as I can remember,
I'd been waiting for my parents to die...


2
00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.151
...so I could commit suicide without feeling
an overwhelming sense of guilt.


3
00:01:21.684 --> 00:01:23.541
And there they were...

4
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:25.948
...dead.

5
00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:30.057
And I didn't have the guts
to go through with it.


6
00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:34.526
Florence?

7
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.696
Florence?

8
00:01:40.304 --> 00:01:41.756
Florence!

9
00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:44.058
I'm pouring my guts
out and you fall asleep?

10
00:01:44.158 --> 00:01:47.386
I did. How does that make you feel?

11
00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.859
Angry.

12
00:01:52.783 --> 00:01:56.220
Okay, you know how some old people
are asked to stop driving?


13
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.121
It's not that most of them are incapable...

14
00:01:58.221 --> 00:02:01.058
...it's just not particularly safe
for them to be on the road.


15
00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:04.928
I mean, that just about sums up
how I feel about you as a psychiatrist.


16
00:02:05.028 --> 00:02:07.011
It's time to throw in the towel.

17
00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:11.360
I'm sensing a great deal
of hostility coming from you.


18
00:02:13.571 --> 00:02:15.763
Go fuck yourself, Florence.

19
00:02:27.318 --> 00:02:28.866
You look nice.

20
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.833
What's wrong?

21
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.599
Nothing.

22
00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:43.266
Don't do this to me.

23
00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:47.171
I told myself for the longest time
you were actually gonna grow up.


24
00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:53.777
- I can't... I can't do this, I'm gonna go.
- Stop, okay, fine. Okay?


25
00:02:54.677 --> 00:02:57.955
Don't go. I'll cut down on my drinking,
whatever you want.


26
00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:02.119
We've been together for three years,
nothing's changed.


27
00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.023
I need security in a relationship...

28
00:03:05.923 --> 00:03:08.526
...and I don't get
it from you anymore, Owen.

29
00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:11.686
Excuse me, ma'am, pardon my reach.

30
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.106
Thank you.

31
00:03:23.907 --> 00:03:28.145
What am I still doing here?
You obviously don't care.


32
00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:30.482
I don't even know what to say anymore.

33
00:03:31.882 --> 00:03:35.419
Don't do that with your napkin.
There are real people here.


34
00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.855
I need a girlfriend, not a second mother.

35
00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:39.737
I'm supposed to be sexually
attracted to you...


36
00:03:39.837 --> 00:03:42.711
...and right now you're not giving me
much to work with.


37
00:03:44.975 --> 00:03:47.213
Happy fucking anniversary.

38
00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:10.497
Isabel!

39
00:05:24.441 --> 00:05:26.122
Okay.

40
00:05:27.917 --> 00:05:29.529
Hey.

41
00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:33.421
You're such an asshole.

42
00:05:36.186 --> 00:05:40.063
You fucked up last weekend.
Our anniversary sucked...


43
00:05:40.163 --> 00:05:43.798
...and then you have a seizure,
and here I am taking care of you.


44
00:05:45.962 --> 00:05:48.165
This looks pretty good.

45
00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:53.272
Well, if it's not
and you value your life, lie.


46
00:05:55.706 --> 00:05:57.941
Can I at least get some salt?

47
00:05:58.541 --> 00:06:01.097
- No.
- Okay.


48
00:06:01.197 --> 00:06:04.866
Hey, look on the bright side,
at least I didn't shit myself this time.


49
00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:09.730
Oh, God, really?

50
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:12.565
It was only a little.

51
00:06:15.859 --> 00:06:18.313
What is a girl like you
doing with a guy like me?


52
00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:23.470
Working through my self-esteem issues
before planning my escape.


53
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:29.344
Thank you.

54
00:06:42.052 --> 00:06:45.255
Isabel, do you hear that? What is that?

55
00:06:46.055 --> 00:06:48.124
Is that the smoke detector?

56
00:06:48.624 --> 00:06:53.330
It's fine. That's just the sound
it makes when the battery's low.


57
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.124
It makes a different beep when it's smoke.

58
00:07:01.638 --> 00:07:04.475
Owen, just take the battery out.

59
00:07:04.575 --> 00:07:06.822
I think I'm having a panic attack.

60
00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:20.391
- Hi.
- Hi.


61
00:07:20.491 --> 00:07:22.960
Sorry, we're late.
We didn't get a lot of sleep last night.


62
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.029
I'm a little short for time, so I took the
liberty of ordering for the three of us.


63
00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:29.967
You're gonna love that French toast.
You mind if I say a prayer before we eat?


64
00:07:30.267 --> 00:07:32.074
Give me your hand.

65
00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:38.358
Dear God, thank you for this time
with my lovely sister...


66
00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:42.012
...and her off-again, on-again boyfriend.

67
00:07:42.112 --> 00:07:45.438
Please bless us and these gifts which we
are about to receive from Thy bounty...


68
00:07:45.538 --> 00:07:47.819
...through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

69
00:07:49.352 --> 00:07:52.590
- Do you mind if I say a few words?
- Please do.


70
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.193
Dark Lord of the Abyss,
we wish to become one...


71
00:07:56.293 --> 00:07:58.795
That's not funny. 
That's not funny.

72
00:07:59.295 --> 00:08:01.876
No one's laughing, because it's not funny.

73
00:08:05.869 --> 00:08:08.278
So, Mom and Dad tell me
you're doing really well.


74
00:08:08.378 --> 00:08:10.870
Congratulations on the promotion at work.

75
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:15.165
It's actually not a promotion,
it's just a pay raise, but thank you.


76
00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:17.734
Well, you know what, at any rate,
I'm happy for you.


77
00:08:17.834 --> 00:08:20.070
We're all so proud of you
and your little achievements.


78
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:23.707
- Everyone back home sends their best.
- Well, I miss everybody.


79
00:08:23.807 --> 00:08:27.844
I talk to Mom and Dad on the phone pretty
much every day, but it's not the same.


80
00:08:27.944 --> 00:08:29.396
I hope to come
and visit you guys soon.

81
00:08:29.496 --> 00:08:32.015
We would absolutely love that.
I hope you do that.


82
00:08:32.115 --> 00:08:34.996
- Please make that happen.
- Yes.


83
00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:41.737
And I trust you're looking after
my sister, as best you're capable?


84
00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.344
You know, Owen, 
I'd be lying...

85
00:08:49.444 --> 00:08:51.826
...if I said that I'd pick you
as the ideal mate for Isabel...


86
00:08:51.926 --> 00:08:54.671
...but if you're going to continue
this courtship...


87
00:08:54.871 --> 00:08:57.916
...you should look into making
an honest woman out of her.


88
00:09:01.044 --> 00:09:04.527
I'm not taking relationship advice
from a beige earthworm.


89
00:09:14.024 --> 00:09:16.060
It was really nice seeing you.

90
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.795
I'll be back in town on business shortly.

91
00:09:17.895 --> 00:09:20.263
I hope we can get together again,
just the two of us.


92
00:09:20.363 --> 00:09:22.266
I love you, Caleb.

93
00:09:22.566 --> 00:09:25.906
- I love you.
- Love you.


94
00:09:34.344 --> 00:09:37.955
Hey. I know that family
is a touchy subject for you...


95
00:09:38.055 --> 00:09:39.640
...and maybe you feel
like you don't have one...


96
00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.652
...but if you could make more of an effort
with mine, that would mean a lot to me.


97
00:09:42.752 --> 00:09:44.822
Your family hates me.

98
00:09:45.222 --> 00:09:48.158
They don't hate you.
They just don't know you.


99
00:09:48.258 --> 00:09:50.894
All they know is what Caleb tells them
and you treat him like garbage.


100
00:09:50.994 --> 00:09:53.197
He's a self-righteous prick.

101
00:09:53.597 --> 00:09:55.678
You're both full of shit.

102
00:09:57.167 --> 00:09:59.909
You know what? You're right.

103
00:10:00.009 --> 00:10:02.243
I'm gonna make more of an effort.

104
00:10:04.607 --> 00:10:06.510
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.


105
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:09.890
I love you, and I
owe you at least that much.

106
00:10:12.615 --> 00:10:14.151
Thank you, Owen.

107
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:18.531
What do you say we celebrate my
newfound transformation with a little sex?


108
00:10:21.224 --> 00:10:24.635
I'm gonna have to pretend it was
another man's penis inside me.


109
00:10:25.795 --> 00:10:27.598
I'm okay with that.

110
00:10:28.098 --> 00:10:29.783
Okay.

111
00:10:33.336 --> 00:10:36.139
What's going on?
It normally doesn't take you this long.


112
00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:40.678
- It's been like 30 seconds.
- I know, is everything okay?


113
00:10:41.878 --> 00:10:44.314
Maybe it's your complete lack of enthusiasm.

114
00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:46.650
Well, your balls smell real bad.

115
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.919
I wanted to keep us in the moment.

116
00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:51.087
Just take a shower next time.

117
00:10:51.187 --> 00:10:55.291
You know what, I'm gonna go
jerk off in the bathroom.


118
00:10:55.391 --> 00:10:57.461
Don't use the towels.

119
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:32.829
What's wrong?

120
00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:35.599
Nothing, it's just nerves.

121
00:11:35.999 --> 00:11:38.201
Do you want me to take you home?
We can always reschedule.


122
00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:41.438
- No, you're not getting out of this.
- Okay.


123
00:11:41.538 --> 00:11:43.385
I'm fine.

124
00:11:47.644 --> 00:11:50.046
- Hello.
- Hello.


125
00:11:50.846 --> 00:11:53.583
Uh, Florence, I'd like
to start off by apologizing...


126
00:11:53.683 --> 00:11:57.053
...for telling you to find a new line of work
at our one-on-one session the other day.


127
00:11:57.153 --> 00:12:00.030
You seemed caught off-guard to find out
that you're terrible at your job...


128
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.893
- ...and I honestly thought you knew.
- Don't talk to Florence like that.


129
00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:04.527
She fell asleep at our session.

130
00:12:04.627 --> 00:12:07.731
Yeah, I'd fall asleep too, if I had to
listen to you talk for an hour straight.


131
00:12:07.831 --> 00:12:10.955
You know, I'm beginning to feel like
my relationship with both of you...


132
00:12:11.055 --> 00:12:13.619
...is becoming equally unhealthy.

133
00:12:13.719 --> 00:12:16.907
Well, let's get back on track, shall we?

134
00:12:17.407 --> 00:12:20.744
Isabel, you voiced a concern
about Owen's drinking.


135
00:12:20.844 --> 00:12:23.514
- Do you still have an issue with that?
- No.


136
00:12:23.614 --> 00:12:29.419
Because I told him I'd cut his dick off,
and he knew that, and I meant it.


137
00:12:29.519 --> 00:12:31.522
She did tell me
she'd cut off my dick...

138
00:12:31.622 --> 00:12:34.457
...and I did know it, but I wasn't
particularly concerned on account...


139
00:12:34.557 --> 00:12:37.127
...of the fact that I don't use it
for much except pissing.


140
00:12:37.227 --> 00:12:39.362
In fact, I'd love to see it go...

141
00:12:39.462 --> 00:12:42.365
...because all I do is look at it every day
and it reminds me of better times.


142
00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:44.601
Now when I brought up your dick,
it wasn't my intention...


143
00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:48.070
...for you to just run with it
as a topic of conversation.


144
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.940
You know, gay guys get excited about dick.

145
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.576
It's celebrated and sought
after in their community.


146
00:12:53.676 --> 00:12:56.346
You show a picture of a dick
to a woman, watch her cringe.


147
00:12:56.446 --> 00:12:58.681
What are you saying, you're gay now?

148
00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:02.736
I'm saying, I wish I
was. I wish I was.

149
00:13:03.036 --> 00:13:07.357
It's not dick that makes women cringe,
it's specifically your dick.


150
00:13:07.457 --> 00:13:10.660
Threatening Owen isn't going to help him
with his drinking problem.


151
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.063
- I don't have a drinking problem.
- Yes, you do...


152
00:13:13.163 --> 00:13:16.166
...and all your idiotic friends
just encourage it.


153
00:13:16.266 --> 00:13:18.668
Okay, so I'm a substance abuser
with an ugly dick...


154
00:13:18.768 --> 00:13:23.841
...who's mentally ill-equipped to stand up
to peer pressure and you're dating me.


155
00:13:24.941 --> 00:13:28.417
Sometimes you don't choose
who you fall in love with.


156
00:13:33.717 --> 00:13:37.314
All right, one drink here,
one drink at dinner, okay?


157
00:13:37.414 --> 00:13:40.294
It's gonna take more than two drinks
for me to become detached enough...


158
00:13:40.394 --> 00:13:42.658
...to make it through dinner
with your friends.


159
00:13:42.758 --> 00:13:46.562
What do you mean "my friends?"
Sheldon and Mimi are our friends.


160
00:13:46.662 --> 00:13:50.533
- Keep telling yourself that.
- What, come on, you and Sheldon are cool.


161
00:13:50.633 --> 00:13:54.705
Sheldon and I do not have a friendship,
we have an understanding.


162
00:13:55.605 --> 00:13:57.707
I'm going to give you
a chance to stop right now...


163
00:13:57.807 --> 00:14:00.377
...before you piss me off enough
to a point there's turning back.


164
00:14:00.477 --> 00:14:03.446
It has become painfully obvious
to Sheldon and myself...


165
00:14:03.546 --> 00:14:06.015
...that we're going to have
to interact on a monthly basis...


166
00:14:06.115 --> 00:14:08.018
...so we let you two
do most of the talking...


167
00:14:08.118 --> 00:14:10.187
...we reduce our conversation
to banal pleasantries...


168
00:14:10.287 --> 00:14:12.822
...and everybody comes out unscathed.

169
00:14:12.922 --> 00:14:16.792
I've spent countless evenings with the guy,
I can't tell you what he does for a living.


170
00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:20.130
He's a paralegal. 
A paralegal, okay?

171
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.000
You asked him that three times last time
we hung out. It was embarrassing.


172
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.204
I can't wrap my head around why it's so
important for you that I like your friends.


173
00:14:28.304 --> 00:14:31.206
Isn't it enough that
I hang out with them?

174
00:14:31.306 --> 00:14:33.977
I hate you sometimes. I really do.

175
00:14:34.077 --> 00:14:36.279
Let's go, we're already late.

176
00:14:37.379 --> 00:14:39.224
Yeah, great.

177
00:14:43.836 --> 00:14:46.773
So what's going on with you guys?
Tell me, what's up?


178
00:14:46.873 --> 00:14:49.859
Yeah, um... uh...

179
00:14:49.959 --> 00:14:53.229
My father is in the advanced
stages of Alzheimer's.


180
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:56.299
- Oh.
- Yeah, it's a terrible disease.


181
00:14:56.399 --> 00:14:59.418
It's been really tough, but all my time's
been spent going back and forth...


182
00:14:59.518 --> 00:15:03.640
...between our house and the nursing home
and Sheldon's been really busy with work.


183
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.810
Oh, yeah. What is
it that you do again?

184
00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.637
- You gotta be kidding me, bro.
- Some sort of lawyer?


185
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:17.831
- I'm a paralegal.
- Yeah, that's right, fascinating.


186
00:15:21.224 --> 00:15:25.061
- I'm really sorry to hear about your father.
- Yeah, it's been really hard.


187
00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:30.000
- You need anything, let me know.
- I know, you're the best. I know, thank you.


188
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:34.571
Owen, forgive me if I'm...
I don't know, if it's a touchy subject...


189
00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:38.075
...but I've never heard you bring up
your family in conversation.


190
00:15:39.475 --> 00:15:41.678
My parents died in a fire.

191
00:15:42.178 --> 00:15:46.516
- Oh.
- His... his sister survived.


192
00:15:46.616 --> 00:15:48.651
She lives with my crazy grandmother.

193
00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:53.523
That's awful. I'm so sorry. Have you
kept in touch with your sister at all?


194
00:15:53.623 --> 00:15:57.861
Nah. Pretty sure she hates me.

195
00:15:57.961 --> 00:16:01.031
I'm trying to convince him to,
you know, reach out to her.


196
00:16:01.131 --> 00:16:02.899
Too much guilt, honey.

197
00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:05.335
So long as we're on the subject
of guilt, you know...


198
00:16:05.435 --> 00:16:08.305
...I don't get why they have to put
the caloric content on the menu.


199
00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:11.774
You know, I was going to order a burger...
but I just can't bring myself to do it?


200
00:16:11.874 --> 00:16:14.010
I just feel bad about it.

201
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.879
Yeah, it's hard when you know,
it's like, right there.


202
00:16:16.979 --> 00:16:20.934
Owen, hey, tell us, bro. What's your secret?
How do you stay so thin, man?


203
00:16:21.034 --> 00:16:23.820
- I eat whatever I want.
- Must be some metabolism.


204
00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:26.392
Nope. I'm bulimic.

205
00:16:30.944 --> 00:16:32.946
Wow, yeah, I thought
that was a girl disease.

206
00:16:33.046 --> 00:16:35.881
Well, in all fairness,
you're also kind of an idiot.


207
00:16:36.431 --> 00:16:39.035
- Wow.
- Apologize to Sheldon.


208
00:16:39.135 --> 00:16:43.016
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I haven't had enough to drink.


209
00:16:58.988 --> 00:17:02.658
Can you not drink out of the carton?
It's disgusting.


210
00:17:05.027 --> 00:17:09.732
I'm sorry that I snapped at Sheldon.
Talking about my family puts me on edge.


211
00:17:09.832 --> 00:17:13.169
Yeah, well, we're eventually going
to run out of people to hang out with.


212
00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:16.139
If I'm stuck with you all the time,
I'll go crazy.


213
00:17:16.239 --> 00:17:18.108
I understand.

214
00:17:18.808 --> 00:17:22.279
So, any chance you want to fuck?

215
00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:25.848
Any chance you can be romantic, ever?

216
00:17:25.948 --> 00:17:29.753
Okay, intimate? 
Do you want to be intimate?

217
00:17:30.953 --> 00:17:33.289
I let you have sex with me
three times last week.


218
00:17:33.389 --> 00:17:36.593
I really feel like we shouldn't do it
again until I'm back on birth control.


219
00:17:36.693 --> 00:17:40.077
Isabel, we've had enough unprotected
sex without birth control...


220
00:17:40.177 --> 00:17:45.101
...to come to at least three conclusions.
Either I'm the master king at pulling out...


221
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:50.008
...I'm sterile, or you're barren.
All roads leads to us having sex tonight.


222
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:55.311
Not sure I can handle
the increase in your sex drive...


223
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:58.014
...since you've slowed down on the drinking.

224
00:17:58.614 --> 00:18:01.225
Starting to miss the guy who'd come
home every night in a drunken stupor...


225
00:18:01.325 --> 00:18:03.728
...with a flaccid penis. Let's go.

226
00:18:06.588 --> 00:18:08.993
Can you at least take off your shirt?

227
00:18:10.293 --> 00:18:12.138
I'll come faster.

228
00:18:18.268 --> 00:18:21.571
- Be gentle... I'm not wet yet.
- You're never wet.


229
00:18:21.671 --> 00:18:23.986
Well, that means you're doing
something wrong.


230
00:18:38.755 --> 00:18:40.566
This is new.

231
00:19:02.612 --> 00:19:05.848
- Well, that was unexpected.
- I think you mean traumatic.


232
00:19:05.948 --> 00:19:08.718
- I'm in the hospital?
- Mm-hm.


233
00:19:08.818 --> 00:19:11.711
- It was your worst one yet.
- How long have I been here?


234
00:19:12.021 --> 00:19:13.890
Three hours.

235
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:16.448
- Hi.
- Hi.


236
00:19:19.829 --> 00:19:22.899
- Everyone okay?
- Someone tell me I'm still dreaming.


237
00:19:22.999 --> 00:19:26.202
Caleb had to jet back in town for
another last minute corporate meeting.


238
00:19:26.302 --> 00:19:29.105
Well, I'm not dead yet.
So you can hold off on all your celebrating.


239
00:19:29.205 --> 00:19:33.142
That's very funny. Look, Isabel told me
what happened and I rushed right over.


240
00:19:33.242 --> 00:19:36.612
Oh, she told you I had a seizure
while we were fucking?


241
00:19:36.712 --> 00:19:39.999
- What? What did you say?
- Oh, my God.


242
00:19:40.349 --> 00:19:42.423
Are you two sleeping together?

243
00:19:44.886 --> 00:19:47.389
We've been together for three years.

244
00:19:47.489 --> 00:19:50.560
He lives with me. I just assumed
with your background in mathematics...


245
00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.964
- ...you'd be better at deductive reasoning.
- I, on the other hand...


246
00:19:53.064 --> 00:19:56.599
...expected you to be just as delusional
and caught off-guard as you are right now.


247
00:19:56.699 --> 00:20:01.704
Isabel, this is not how you were raised.
I am so ashamed of you.


248
00:20:01.804 --> 00:20:04.374
Please, at least tell me he's your first.

249
00:20:04.474 --> 00:20:07.844
Caleb, my sex life
isn't really any of your business.


250
00:20:07.944 --> 00:20:11.080
You know what, let me just clear
that right up for you.


251
00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:13.349
I've never been with a virgin.

252
00:20:13.449 --> 00:20:16.257
- Fuck you, Owen.
- Is that true?


253
00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:19.589
Fuck both of you.

254
00:20:19.689 --> 00:20:23.192
I think it goes without saying that you
two should get yourselves checked out.


255
00:20:23.292 --> 00:20:26.862
- In the interest of public safety.
- I'm in a committed relationship.


256
00:20:26.962 --> 00:20:29.032
What about you, Caleb? How many times
have you strolled through the clinic...


257
00:20:29.132 --> 00:20:31.301
...while fucking your way
through two failed marriages?


258
00:20:31.401 --> 00:20:33.703
If you weren't already in a hospital bed,
I would put you in one.


259
00:20:33.803 --> 00:20:35.705
Guys, stop it! Both of you!

260
00:20:35.805 --> 00:20:39.876
Will the two of you at least consider saving
face in the eyes of God and getting married?


261
00:20:39.976 --> 00:20:44.284
No, because that means we'd no longer
be living in sin and we enjoy living in sin.


262
00:20:44.384 --> 00:20:46.282
Speak for yourself.

263
00:20:47.282 --> 00:20:51.254
Caleb, I'm sorry, I feel like you should
just go. But I'll see you next week.


264
00:20:51.354 --> 00:20:54.014
I'll see you for Shelby's birthday,
I'm going to take the train in and...


265
00:20:54.114 --> 00:20:55.926
You're uninvited.

266
00:20:56.678 --> 00:20:59.602
I don't want such a negative
influence around my daughter.


267
00:20:59.702 --> 00:21:04.408
And until you straighten up your act, you
should not be allowed anywhere near children.


268
00:21:19.748 --> 00:21:24.286
Come on, who cares, you'll never see your
niece again, she's a pain in the ass, anyway.


269
00:21:24.386 --> 00:21:28.557
She's supposed to be my fucking
goddaughter, you heartless sack of shit.


270
00:21:28.857 --> 00:21:30.960
What if I told you I want
to have kids some day?


271
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.653
Go ahead. It's your body, do what
you want, but don't treat pregnancy...


272
00:21:33.753 --> 00:21:36.866
...like some special achievement.
Crack whores have babies.


273
00:21:36.966 --> 00:21:40.602
All you have to do is spread your legs,
and invite someone to jizz in you.


274
00:21:41.402 --> 00:21:45.374
That is the most vile thing I've ever
heard come out of your mouth.


275
00:21:46.174 --> 00:21:49.545
Best case scenario, you have a healthy baby
that turns into a piece of shit teenager...


276
00:21:49.645 --> 00:21:54.083
...and makes only a portion of your life
a living hell. That is the best-case scenario.


277
00:21:55.883 --> 00:21:59.688
- I hate your fucking guts.
- Yeah, what else is new?


278
00:22:00.688 --> 00:22:02.492
I'm pregnant.

279
00:22:03.392 --> 00:22:05.829
- What?
- I'm pregnant.


280
00:22:07.529 --> 00:22:10.166
- Don't worry, I'm having an abortion.
- Yeah, of course, you are.


281
00:22:10.266 --> 00:22:13.081
I mean, what is it, like, 400 bucks?
We'll split it.


282
00:22:15.237 --> 00:22:17.079
Fucking asshole.

283
00:23:15.865 --> 00:23:17.367
Hi.

284
00:23:18.067 --> 00:23:20.703
- What the fuck is this doing here?
- It's a funeral spray.


285
00:23:20.803 --> 00:23:23.572
Yeah, I can see that. 
What is it doing here?

286
00:23:23.672 --> 00:23:26.576
It's part of a whole thing I'm doing.
Will you sit down?


287
00:23:26.676 --> 00:23:27.644
No.

288
00:23:27.744 --> 00:23:30.785
Come on, just give me
a few minutes, and then I'll leave.


289
00:23:35.117 --> 00:23:36.952
You got two.

290
00:23:37.652 --> 00:23:41.056
So, I couldn't sleep last night,
so I wrote your obituary.


291
00:23:41.856 --> 00:23:43.931
No, it's a nice thing.

292
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.443
Get it over with.

293
00:23:52.935 --> 00:23:55.605
Isabel Sullivan, 93,
of Los Angeles, California...


294
00:23:55.705 --> 00:23:58.975
...died peacefully
of natural causes yesterday.


295
00:23:59.675 --> 00:24:02.211
Though they cannot say
to an absolute degree of certainty...


296
00:24:02.311 --> 00:24:06.282
...friends and family speculate
that if Heaven does in fact exist...


297
00:24:06.382 --> 00:24:08.751
...that's probably where she went.

298
00:24:09.051 --> 00:24:12.103
She was born in Carson City, Nevada,
and graduated with a business degree...


299
00:24:12.203 --> 00:24:16.459
...from some forgettable second-tier college
even she had trouble remembering the name of.


300
00:24:17.159 --> 00:24:20.496
She was married to Owen Roberts,
noted web designer...


301
00:24:20.596 --> 00:24:24.634
...who loved her very much,
even though he had trouble showing it.


302
00:24:25.234 --> 00:24:27.002
They adopted later in life...

303
00:24:27.102 --> 00:24:30.206
...and she was often heard remarking
on what a great father he was...


304
00:24:30.306 --> 00:24:33.576
...despite the fact that he
could be a miserable bastard.


305
00:24:34.526 --> 00:24:37.513
He loved everything about her,
even the disgusting fact...


306
00:24:37.613 --> 00:24:40.917
...that she would leave her dried contact
lenses scattered around the apartment.


307
00:24:41.017 --> 00:24:46.826
To him, she was perfect and he could
not imagine himself with anyone else.


308
00:24:50.226 --> 00:24:51.891
I'm sorry about last night.

309
00:24:58.167 --> 00:24:59.636
Okay.

310
00:25:01.036 --> 00:25:04.843
This is pretty tacky...

311
00:25:04.943 --> 00:25:07.131
...and inappropriate.

312
00:25:07.276 --> 00:25:12.283
But I get that you are doing
a nice thing in your own weird way.


313
00:25:14.483 --> 00:25:16.819
Let's just talk about it
when I get home tonight.


314
00:25:16.919 --> 00:25:18.363
Okay.

315
00:25:23.575 --> 00:25:25.677
- Owen!
- Yeah.


316
00:25:25.777 --> 00:25:27.580
Get this thing out of here.

317
00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:29.467
Okay.

318
00:25:44.313 --> 00:25:46.160
Thank you.

319
00:25:59.962 --> 00:26:01.505
So...

320
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.269
- ...how long have you known?
- Two weeks.


321
00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:10.272
How could you keep this
from me for so long?

322
00:26:10.372 --> 00:26:13.542
Because I wasn't even sure
if I was even going to keep it.


323
00:26:13.642 --> 00:26:16.212
And I knew you'd react
basically how you did...


324
00:26:16.312 --> 00:26:18.551
...so, I mean, what would be the point?

325
00:26:20.883 --> 00:26:24.290
Again, I'm sorry. 
I was caught off-guard.

326
00:26:26.622 --> 00:26:29.786
Let's be honest, you're not responsible
enough to even be in a relationship...


327
00:26:29.886 --> 00:26:33.796
- ...let alone be a dad.
- Okay, don't put this on me.


328
00:26:33.896 --> 00:26:36.732
We both know it's
just not the right timing.

329
00:26:36.832 --> 00:26:41.237
If I was in a stable relationship,
I would keep this kid.


330
00:26:43.037 --> 00:26:46.484
I'm not getting any younger. 
I want a family.

331
00:26:47.143 --> 00:26:50.585
I just don't want one with you.

332
00:26:56.551 --> 00:26:58.187
That is shitty thing to say to me.

333
00:26:58.287 --> 00:27:00.823
Owen, you don't even keep
in touch with your own family...


334
00:27:00.923 --> 00:27:03.192
...you've alienated me from mine.

335
00:27:03.292 --> 00:27:07.829
I'm sure there's love for me somewhere
in there, but it's not like it used to be.


336
00:27:07.929 --> 00:27:12.101
Okay, first of all, that's not true.
And I'm not saying that it's what I want...


337
00:27:12.201 --> 00:27:15.253
...but I think I'd make a great father.

338
00:27:16.738 --> 00:27:18.608
Are you insane?

339
00:27:18.808 --> 00:27:22.745
Some of the biggest pieces of shit I've ever
met are parents. I think I could do it.


340
00:27:23.145 --> 00:27:27.194
Well, I'm not going to have a kid with you,
just so you can prove a point.


341
00:27:54.109 --> 00:27:56.315
Isabel, I want to have this baby.

342
00:27:59.248 --> 00:28:03.653
Okay, wake up. Wake up, okay?
I want to tell you something.


343
00:28:04.453 --> 00:28:07.856
Listen, I know things haven't been
as good as they once were.


344
00:28:07.956 --> 00:28:11.660
But we'll get back there.
I'll make sure of it.


345
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.835
This could be your only chance
to have a baby.


346
00:28:15.765 --> 00:28:17.834
It could change our lives.

347
00:28:18.634 --> 00:28:20.870
I mean, as fucked up as we are...

348
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:24.280
...I can't imagine doing this
with anyone else.


349
00:28:32.881 --> 00:28:34.884
You really want to keep this baby?

350
00:28:35.284 --> 00:28:39.326
Yes, I want us
to keep this baby together.

351
00:28:45.961 --> 00:28:50.266
First, I want you to call Caleb
and apologize to him.


352
00:28:51.166 --> 00:28:52.301
Of course, yes.

353
00:28:52.401 --> 00:28:55.070
Be the first step in getting
my family to like you.


354
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:56.639
Okay.

355
00:28:57.139 --> 00:28:59.815
Second, I want us to go and visit
your grandmother and sister...


356
00:28:59.915 --> 00:29:01.730
...and reconcile with them.

357
00:29:02.244 --> 00:29:04.344
Oh, Isabel...

358
00:29:05.488 --> 00:29:07.749
No. I... that's...

359
00:29:07.849 --> 00:29:10.644
If we're gonna have a family of our own,
I'd like to see you reconnect...


360
00:29:10.744 --> 00:29:13.762
- ...with the one you've got.
- You don't know what you're asking.


361
00:29:16.658 --> 00:29:18.229
So?

362
00:29:21.263 --> 00:29:23.133
It's important to me.

363
00:29:57.531 --> 00:29:59.969
Not being able to drive is humiliating.

364
00:30:00.069 --> 00:30:02.104
Yeah, well, if this new
medication works out...


365
00:30:02.204 --> 00:30:05.275
...you'll be able to get your license
renewed in a few months.


366
00:30:06.575 --> 00:30:08.845
I can't believe I agreed to do this.

367
00:30:09.545 --> 00:30:13.349
I mean, we're just getting on the road,
and my hands are already starting to sweat.


368
00:30:13.849 --> 00:30:16.651
Aw... you must really love me.

369
00:30:16.751 --> 00:30:20.823
You know I haven't seen or spoken to my
grandmother or my sister since the funeral?


370
00:30:21.723 --> 00:30:23.559
You did tell them
we were coming though, right?


371
00:30:23.659 --> 00:30:26.328
- Yeah, of course.
- What'd they say?


372
00:30:26.428 --> 00:30:28.163
Well, I only got my grandmother
on the phone...


373
00:30:28.263 --> 00:30:31.433
...and she said she'd be willing
to tolerate the inconvenience.


374
00:30:31.533 --> 00:30:34.937
Ah... she sounds a lot like you.

375
00:30:35.237 --> 00:30:38.483
Well, by comparison, 
I'm relatively pleasant.

376
00:30:42.043 --> 00:30:44.247
Is that why you guys don't talk anymore?

377
00:30:46.047 --> 00:30:48.050
It's a long story.

378
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:53.151
Come on, man, we've got a long drive
ahead of us. You know all my secrets.


379
00:30:54.256 --> 00:30:57.493
Okay. Fine.

380
00:30:58.793 --> 00:31:00.973
<i>The only thing my parents
had in common was religion.</i>


381
00:31:01.263 --> 00:31:03.667
All right, let's give this one last try.

382
00:31:04.967 --> 00:31:10.305
- <i>They never got along.</i>
- Smile this time, Owen. A real smile.


383
00:31:10.405 --> 00:31:13.275
Lower your chin, you don't look macho,
you look like a thug.


384
00:31:13.375 --> 00:31:14.710
Smiles!

385
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:17.663
<i>I was practically hate-fucked into existence.</i>

386
00:31:17.763 --> 00:31:21.450
<i>After they had my sister,
things went even further downhill.</i>


387
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:25.353
<i>They thought it would strengthen their
marriage, but it only made things worse...</i>


388
00:31:25.453 --> 00:31:28.123
<i>...duh. As far as I was concerned...</i>

389
00:31:28.223 --> 00:31:32.194
<i>...my father's primary method of
communication was quoting scripture.</i>


390
00:31:32.294 --> 00:31:36.090
<i>My mom was different. 
Her main vice was sex.</i>

391
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:40.669
<i>She loved to fuck.
That's probably where I get it from.</i>


392
00:31:40.769 --> 00:31:44.039
<i>Though, in fairness,
she was a lot better lay than me.</i>


393
00:31:44.139 --> 00:31:47.035
<i>More often than not,
people would come back for seconds...</i>


394
00:31:47.135 --> 00:31:48.844
<i>...and thirds, and fourths.</i>

395
00:31:48.944 --> 00:31:52.014
<i>Around that time, I started
to refuse to go to church.</i>


396
00:31:52.114 --> 00:31:54.716
<i>That's when they sent me away
to a school for troubled youth...</i>


397
00:31:54.816 --> 00:31:57.752
<i>...which I was subsequently expelled from.</i>

398
00:31:57.852 --> 00:32:02.024
<i>One night, while I was on one of
my benders, the house caught fire.</i>


399
00:32:02.124 --> 00:32:07.596
<i>I had installed the propane,
something went wrong, I fucked up.</i>


400
00:32:07.796 --> 00:32:10.132
<i>My parents were burned alive,
and my sister escaped...</i>


401
00:32:10.232 --> 00:32:13.235
<i>...with third-degree burns
on over 80% of her body.</i>


402
00:32:13.735 --> 00:32:16.138
<i>She was unrecognizable.</i>

403
00:32:16.238 --> 00:32:19.691
<i>After my parents died, we ended up
moving in with my grandmother.</i>


404
00:32:22.227 --> 00:32:24.847
<i>We planned our escape,
but with her medical condition...</i>


405
00:32:24.947 --> 00:32:29.200
<i>...I knew we didn't stand a chance.
Not together.</i>


406
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.287
<i>So I left her...
alone on the side of the road.</i>


407
00:32:32.387 --> 00:32:36.840
<i>I planned on going back for her,
but I never found the courage.</i>


408
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:39.843
Of course, that is, until now...

409
00:32:39.943 --> 00:32:43.566
...on account of the fact that you
threatened to abort my unborn child.


410
00:32:44.166 --> 00:32:46.068
Baby, the fact that you've kept
this from me...


411
00:32:46.168 --> 00:32:49.304
...for the three years we've been
together, it terrifies me.


412
00:32:49.404 --> 00:32:54.883
Yeah, well, you know... it's not something
you just bring up casually at dinner.


413
00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.562
- I thought you liked that song.
- I'm starting to get nervous.


414
00:33:13.662 --> 00:33:16.231
You're nervous, 
I'm petrified.

415
00:33:16.331 --> 00:33:18.266
Say something comforting.

416
00:33:18.366 --> 00:33:21.824
- It's not my fortÃ©.
- Just try.


417
00:33:21.924 --> 00:33:25.985
Okay, I guess there's a chance
this won't be a complete disaster.


418
00:33:27.743 --> 00:33:29.745
Okay, put the music back on.

419
00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:29.984
Well, here we go.

420
00:34:50.759 --> 00:34:53.598
No, you cannot stay the night, no.

421
00:34:56.898 --> 00:34:59.735
- Owen.
- Hello, Grandmother.


422
00:35:00.435 --> 00:35:02.704
You remember Pastor Sterling?

423
00:35:03.104 --> 00:35:05.575
How could I forget Pastor Sterling?

424
00:35:06.975 --> 00:35:08.848
Yes, well...

425
00:35:08.948 --> 00:35:12.519
...you see, I look in from time
to time on your grandmother.


426
00:35:14.049 --> 00:35:16.885
And isn't it wonderful to see
that she's improving.


427
00:35:16.985 --> 00:35:19.588
- What do you mean?
- Well, thank you very much, Sterling.


428
00:35:19.688 --> 00:35:23.689
I will see you on Sunday morning
for early service.


429
00:35:23.789 --> 00:35:25.400
Okay.

430
00:35:26.795 --> 00:35:29.834
- Pardon me.
- Oh, yeah, sure.


431
00:35:34.403 --> 00:35:37.306
Well... and who have we here?

432
00:35:37.406 --> 00:35:40.208
- This is Isabel, my girlfriend.
- Hi.


433
00:35:40.708 --> 00:35:43.645
You have a girlfriend?
You said you were married.


434
00:35:43.745 --> 00:35:45.747
You must have misheard.

435
00:35:47.347 --> 00:35:49.208
Well, I...

436
00:35:49.573 --> 00:35:52.812
...well, of course,
you will sleep in separate rooms.


437
00:35:52.912 --> 00:35:57.327
You follow me to the guest room,
and Owen, you'll take the sofa.


438
00:37:14.436 --> 00:37:16.481
Good night, Grandma.

439
00:38:07.455 --> 00:38:09.333
Stop it.

440
00:38:13.161 --> 00:38:16.569
- Mmm.
- Head of the table, huh?


441
00:38:19.801 --> 00:38:23.008
Oh, sorry, I didn't know.

442
00:38:25.073 --> 00:38:27.776
Oh, Owen, you were properly raised.

443
00:38:27.876 --> 00:38:30.556
You know the fork goes on the left.

444
00:38:36.918 --> 00:38:38.911
I'll say grace.

445
00:38:39.788 --> 00:38:44.251
Heavenly Father, we thank you for
this food which you have sanctified...


446
00:38:44.351 --> 00:38:47.579
...and we pray that it will give us
the strength to do thy Holy will...


447
00:38:47.679 --> 00:38:50.899
...through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

448
00:38:50.999 --> 00:38:52.408
Yup.

449
00:38:54.636 --> 00:38:56.514
That was lovely.

450
00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.177
- Where do you go to church?
- We don't.


451
00:39:03.812 --> 00:39:08.150
What he means is, we're not as good
about going as we should be.


452
00:39:11.219 --> 00:39:13.255
Grandma, where's Pearl?

453
00:39:13.755 --> 00:39:16.863
- She takes her meals in her room.
- Why is that?


454
00:39:21.196 --> 00:39:24.452
Because I find it hard
to hold my food down...


455
00:39:24.552 --> 00:39:26.685
...while looking at her.

456
00:39:36.711 --> 00:39:38.248
Pearl?

457
00:39:39.448 --> 00:39:41.895
Well, she's not ready to see you yet.

458
00:39:51.693 --> 00:39:56.998
Owen, have... what's her name,
help me in the kitchen, huh?


459
00:39:57.098 --> 00:39:58.934
Oh, it's Isabel.

460
00:39:59.034 --> 00:40:00.669
Isabel.

461
00:40:01.169 --> 00:40:03.104
Didn't your parents teach you
any manners, honey?


462
00:40:03.204 --> 00:40:06.174
I've got a kitchen full of dirty dishes.

463
00:40:06.274 --> 00:40:08.689
Oh, yeah, sure, be right there.

464
00:40:12.664 --> 00:40:14.902
Go easy on her, huh, Grandma?

465
00:40:44.879 --> 00:40:47.849
What is wrong with Owen?
He hardly touched his plate.


466
00:40:47.949 --> 00:40:50.018
Waste of good food.

467
00:40:50.118 --> 00:40:52.988
Oh, yeah, he has issues with food.

468
00:40:53.088 --> 00:40:57.025
- Um, it's a control thing.
- Control?


469
00:40:57.525 --> 00:40:59.494
He's bulimic.

470
00:41:00.694 --> 00:41:02.400
Oh.

471
00:41:06.034 --> 00:41:09.364
Here, this is for my teeth. 
Don't drop it.

472
00:41:14.809 --> 00:41:17.412
Ma, tell me a little about yourself.

473
00:41:17.512 --> 00:41:22.054
All I know at the moment
is you have bad taste in men.


474
00:41:23.184 --> 00:41:26.905
Uh, well, I am from Carson City, Nevada.

475
00:41:27.005 --> 00:41:30.225
- Hm.
- I work in interior design.


476
00:41:30.725 --> 00:41:35.664
It's... it's when you make
the inside of a house nice, like this.


477
00:41:35.764 --> 00:41:41.865
And I'm not sure if Owen told you,
but I am pregnant.


478
00:41:44.972 --> 00:41:46.041
So...

479
00:41:46.141 --> 00:41:49.386
My daughter couldn't keep
her legs closed, either.


480
00:41:54.482 --> 00:41:56.350
It's beautiful here.

481
00:41:56.945 --> 00:41:59.621
Reminds me of where
I grew up in England.

482
00:42:00.318 --> 00:42:01.923
I've never been to England.

483
00:42:02.023 --> 00:42:05.059
Always wanted to go, I hear
you come back a changed person...


484
00:42:05.159 --> 00:42:07.062
...something you should always experience.

485
00:42:07.162 --> 00:42:10.965
- Hey, Grandma, what's all this stuff?
- Oh, that's your sister.


486
00:42:11.065 --> 00:42:15.537
She has as much difficulty looking
at herself as I have looking at her.


487
00:42:15.637 --> 00:42:17.639
Well, that's not a
very nice thing to say.

488
00:42:17.739 --> 00:42:20.174
Oh, I'm sure she
didn't mean it like that.

489
00:42:20.874 --> 00:42:24.312
It's so great. You get to look
out your window and just see this.


490
00:42:24.412 --> 00:42:28.248
This is gorgeous.
You must never want to leave.


491
00:42:28.348 --> 00:42:30.785
You know, I appreciate the company...

492
00:42:31.385 --> 00:42:35.023
...but please don't talk. 
Can't we just sit?

493
00:42:35.123 --> 00:42:37.526
Grandma, don't talk to her like that.

494
00:42:37.626 --> 00:42:41.463
She's lovely to look at,
but she never shuts up.


495
00:42:41.563 --> 00:42:43.969
Honestly, I don't know how you stand it.

496
00:42:53.141 --> 00:42:55.410
Okay, so your grandmother's a fucking cunt.

497
00:42:55.510 --> 00:43:00.117
- Yeah, I know. I told you.
- I feel so bad for your sister.


498
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.620
You know, maybe this trip
wasn't such a bad idea.


499
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:09.591
Our mutual disdain for my grandmother might
actually be bringing us closer together.


500
00:43:10.991 --> 00:43:12.428
Yeah.

501
00:43:13.328 --> 00:43:16.931
Okay, I'm going to try
and connect with my sister.


502
00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:19.099
You okay here by yourself?

503
00:43:19.199 --> 00:43:24.648
Yeah, I guess, just close the door.
I need to decompress.


504
00:43:53.301 --> 00:43:54.965
Pearl?

505
00:43:56.437 --> 00:43:58.911
Pearl, it's Owen. 
I just want to talk.

506
00:44:02.243 --> 00:44:04.254
I'm here when you're ready.

507
00:44:27.969 --> 00:44:30.184
Take the napkin out of your shirt.

508
00:44:33.808 --> 00:44:37.846
Why'd you come back here after all
these years? Do you need money?


509
00:44:38.346 --> 00:44:41.684
Because if it's money you're after,
I don't have any.


510
00:44:42.884 --> 00:44:46.821
No. I just thought it'd be good
for Owen to reconnect with his family.


511
00:44:46.921 --> 00:44:51.123
It's a little more complicated
than that, but that's the gist.


512
00:44:52.126 --> 00:44:56.197
Well, I overheard you trying to talk
to your sister this afternoon.


513
00:44:57.297 --> 00:44:59.768
There are things you don't know.

514
00:45:00.268 --> 00:45:04.445
She's a bad girl. 
She's a very bad girl.

515
00:45:06.005 --> 00:45:07.508
How do you mean?

516
00:45:07.608 --> 00:45:11.346
Look... if you came here
expecting me to be pleased...


517
00:45:11.446 --> 00:45:15.750
...because you've fathered
a child out of wedlock, I'm not.


518
00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:18.686
I mean, the very least you
could do is to marry the poor girl...


519
00:45:18.786 --> 00:45:20.989
...before she's discovered
for the slut that she is.


520
00:45:21.089 --> 00:45:22.924
I mean, that's what your father did.

521
00:45:23.024 --> 00:45:25.359
How could you say that
about your own daughter?


522
00:45:25.459 --> 00:45:28.763
Oh, Owen... grow up.

523
00:45:28.863 --> 00:45:31.236
Your mother was a whore.

524
00:45:31.336 --> 00:45:35.086
Your father was a moron,
and your sister's an abomination.


525
00:45:35.636 --> 00:45:40.788
And now, I have to go to my grave
knowing that this bloodline continues?


526
00:45:44.178 --> 00:45:45.733
Excuse me.

527
00:46:09.737 --> 00:46:11.572
We have to go... now.

528
00:46:11.672 --> 00:46:14.842
I know, I know. 
But what about Pearl?

529
00:46:14.942 --> 00:46:18.646
- I'm not comfortable here.
- I can't leave unless I've made up with her.


530
00:46:18.746 --> 00:46:21.081
Okay? I'm so close.

531
00:46:21.181 --> 00:46:24.986
- Can we stay at a motel or something?
- The closest motel's like an hour away.


532
00:46:25.086 --> 00:46:29.329
- The further away the better.
- Just give me a few days. Please.


533
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:34.273
Keep that bitch away from me.

534
00:46:41.035 --> 00:46:44.839
I told you what it
was gonna be like. Okay?

535
00:46:44.939 --> 00:46:46.274
You were right.

536
00:46:46.374 --> 00:46:49.606
Okay, so just bear with me...

537
00:46:50.729 --> 00:46:52.607
...a little.

538
00:47:53.174 --> 00:47:55.577
Good morning, sunshine.

539
00:47:56.777 --> 00:47:59.047
Look what I just found on my nightstand.

540
00:47:59.147 --> 00:48:01.282
Wow, fashionable.

541
00:48:01.382 --> 00:48:04.252
- They're awful.
- So don't wear them.


542
00:48:04.352 --> 00:48:08.289
I think these are like a gift from your
grandmom, like some sort of an apology.


543
00:48:08.389 --> 00:48:11.092
You can always re-gift them
to someone you don't like.


544
00:48:11.792 --> 00:48:15.596
Your grandmother's the only person I've met
that I don't like enough to give these to.


545
00:48:15.696 --> 00:48:20.301
Look, just put them on, and say thank you.
You'll never have to wear them again.


546
00:48:20.401 --> 00:48:23.604
Are you kidding me? You want me
to say thank you after last night?


547
00:48:23.704 --> 00:48:27.175
At least, she's trying to apologize,
that's more than she's ever done for me.


548
00:48:28.875 --> 00:48:30.411
Can we at least clean them or something?

549
00:48:30.511 --> 00:48:33.176
I'm not gonna put your grandmom's
nasty shit in my ear.


550
00:48:34.382 --> 00:48:37.018
Good morning, Grandma. 
How are you feeling?

551
00:48:37.618 --> 00:48:41.989
There's bacon on the stove.
I just couldn't wait any longer.


552
00:48:42.089 --> 00:48:46.296
- I think we're okay with coffee.
- Thank you for the earrings.


553
00:48:56.304 --> 00:48:59.062
Grandma, what was that about?
She was trying to be nice.


554
00:48:59.974 --> 00:49:04.845
After this, you'll come to the store
with me to help with the groceries, huh?


555
00:49:05.245 --> 00:49:07.058
Of course, Grandma.

556
00:49:15.355 --> 00:49:17.767
Oh, thank you for the earrings.

557
00:49:32.073 --> 00:49:35.009
<i>If a man has a
sexual relation with a man...</i>

558
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:38.346
<i>...as one does with a woman,
then both have done what is...</i>


559
00:49:38.446 --> 00:49:41.231
<i>Serve the Lord with fear. And...</i>

560
00:49:41.331 --> 00:49:44.218
<i>And God said to them,
be fruitful and multiply...</i>


561
00:49:44.318 --> 00:49:47.388
<i>Honor your father, and your mother,
so that you might...</i>


562
00:49:47.488 --> 00:49:51.169
<i>Love rejoices in the truth!</i>

563
00:49:57.698 --> 00:50:01.636
Pearl? It's Isabel, 
Owen's girlfriend.

564
00:50:02.336 --> 00:50:04.211
Can I come in?

565
00:50:06.774 --> 00:50:10.790
Owen and your grandmother
went into town. It's just me.


566
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.381
Can we talk?

567
00:50:13.981 --> 00:50:16.019
Put on the blindfold.

568
00:50:27.161 --> 00:50:29.641
Okay, it's on.

569
00:50:35.936 --> 00:50:37.780
Come in.

570
00:50:42.576 --> 00:50:46.647
If I take off the blindfold,
do you promise not to turn around?


571
00:50:46.747 --> 00:50:48.352
Promise.

572
00:51:05.233 --> 00:51:07.702
The earrings were a gift from you.

573
00:51:08.102 --> 00:51:11.005
Do you like them? 
They're my favorite.

574
00:51:11.105 --> 00:51:14.008
- They're beautiful.
- Thanks.


575
00:51:14.108 --> 00:51:17.611
You should sell your jewelry online.
You could make a fortune.


576
00:51:17.711 --> 00:51:19.549
What's 'online'?

577
00:51:22.016 --> 00:51:25.453
- You're kidding, right?
- No, what's it do?


578
00:51:26.153 --> 00:51:29.157
It connects people from all across the world.

579
00:51:29.257 --> 00:51:32.660
Oh, so it's like a fancy telephone?

580
00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.465
Jesus. Yes, that is what it's like.

581
00:51:37.565 --> 00:51:39.399
Be careful.

582
00:51:39.799 --> 00:51:42.236
I used to take
his name in vain, too.

583
00:51:43.436 --> 00:51:46.041
Then he killed my parents
and set me on fire.

584
00:51:49.209 --> 00:51:52.480
I guess it's time for you
to put the blindfold back on now.


585
00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.622
Okay.

586
00:52:03.824 --> 00:52:05.692
Turn around.

587
00:52:06.249 --> 00:52:08.329
Let me get a good look at you.

588
00:52:09.029 --> 00:52:11.099
What color are your eyes?

589
00:52:11.399 --> 00:52:14.468
- Green.
- That's a nice color.


590
00:52:14.568 --> 00:52:17.438
Not my favorite, but it's a good one.

591
00:52:18.338 --> 00:52:19.807
Thanks?

592
00:52:20.707 --> 00:52:24.520
So, what is it that you came here
to see me about?


593
00:52:25.145 --> 00:52:28.817
Your brother... why won't you talk to him?

594
00:52:29.717 --> 00:52:32.153
He was always fighting with my parents.

595
00:52:33.053 --> 00:52:36.457
I don't like fighting.
It makes me feel bad inside.


596
00:52:37.057 --> 00:52:41.362
Okay, but you know
he came here just to talk to you.


597
00:52:41.462 --> 00:52:44.865
He wants to say
he's sorry. He loves you.

598
00:52:45.465 --> 00:52:47.702
Did he tell you
I used to be pretty?

599
00:52:48.202 --> 00:52:51.172
Not model pretty,
but I used to get compliments.


600
00:52:51.272 --> 00:52:53.741
I'm sure you're still very pretty.

601
00:52:54.041 --> 00:52:56.898
No. Not anymore.

602
00:52:58.979 --> 00:53:03.117
Give Owen a chance.
Just think about it, okay?


603
00:53:04.217 --> 00:53:06.659
I think it's time
for you to leave now.

604
00:53:10.057 --> 00:53:12.272
Put the blindfold outside.

605
00:53:16.781 --> 00:53:19.428
- Bye, Pearl.
- Goodbye.


606
00:54:20.427 --> 00:54:23.215
You are not gonna believe this.
Grandmother managed to get us...


607
00:54:23.315 --> 00:54:26.167
- ...kicked out of the supermarket.
- What'd she do?


608
00:54:26.267 --> 00:54:29.262
She was looking for the Brazil nuts
and decided to use a racial epithet...


609
00:54:29.362 --> 00:54:31.838
...when describing them to a black employee.

610
00:54:31.938 --> 00:54:33.707
Classy.

611
00:54:33.807 --> 00:54:35.709
What have you been doing?

612
00:54:35.809 --> 00:54:37.611
Oh, just getting ready for the day...

613
00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:40.681
...thinking about perfect responses
to past arguments we've had.


614
00:54:40.781 --> 00:54:42.950
Well, that sounds healthy.

615
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:45.920
Also managed to have
a conversation with your sister.


616
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:49.022
What? Really? What'd she say?

617
00:54:49.622 --> 00:54:52.833
Give her some time.
I think she'll come around.


618
00:54:55.362 --> 00:54:58.005
- Cool.
- Cool.


619
00:55:01.201 --> 00:55:03.204
Pass the green beans.

620
00:55:04.504 --> 00:55:06.507
Pass the green beans what?

621
00:55:07.207 --> 00:55:09.895
Just pass the green beans.

622
00:55:13.747 --> 00:55:16.951
Pass the green beans what?

623
00:55:17.451 --> 00:55:19.587
Pass the green beans now...

624
00:55:19.687 --> 00:55:23.356
...before your nasty old lady
skin flakes get all over it.


625
00:55:23.456 --> 00:55:27.361
Tsk-tsk, in this house,
we respect our elders.


626
00:55:27.461 --> 00:55:31.065
So if you want to
behave like a female dog...

627
00:55:31.965 --> 00:55:34.369
...you can eat off the floor like one.

628
00:55:35.269 --> 00:55:39.161
You're pathetic. It's no wonder
Owen ran away and never looked back.


629
00:55:39.261 --> 00:55:42.182
First thing in the morning
we're getting the fuck out of here.


630
00:55:43.511 --> 00:55:45.145
Your slut has a foul mouth.

631
00:55:45.245 --> 00:55:47.548
You've been on her ass ever since
we walked through that door.


632
00:55:47.648 --> 00:55:50.284
It's no wonder it took her
so long to explode.


633
00:55:50.384 --> 00:55:52.640
You're just like your father.

634
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:56.123
Your mother may have been a whore,
but she had backbone.


635
00:55:56.223 --> 00:55:58.125
How do you call yourself a Christian?

636
00:55:58.225 --> 00:56:01.115
The same way you're able
to call yourself a man.


637
00:56:01.215 --> 00:56:03.931
You know, I almost wish
this Bible shit was true...


638
00:56:04.031 --> 00:56:07.000
...so that I could watch you burn
right alongside me.


639
00:56:08.668 --> 00:56:12.674
Stop fighting. 
I don't like fighting.

640
00:56:15.275 --> 00:56:16.845
Pearl!

641
00:56:24.518 --> 00:56:29.556
Okay, Pearl, open the door.
Pearl, I just want to talk.


642
00:56:30.356 --> 00:56:33.027
Goddammit, Pearl, open the door.

643
00:56:33.627 --> 00:56:36.364
You left me here with her,
but at least there was no fighting.


644
00:56:36.464 --> 00:56:39.733
Now you came back and there's fighting again.

645
00:56:39.833 --> 00:56:43.203
Okay, Pearl, I'm sorry.
There will be no more fighting.


646
00:56:43.303 --> 00:56:46.140
Isabel and I are leaving
in the morning and it'll all be over.


647
00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:49.513
This is our last chance to talk.
Open the door.


648
00:56:53.647 --> 00:56:55.155
Fuck!

649
00:58:05.953 --> 00:58:08.576
It's okay. It's just me.

650
00:58:09.004 --> 00:58:11.057
It's Pearl.

651
00:58:11.157 --> 00:58:14.578
Hi... hi, what are you doing here?

652
00:58:14.678 --> 00:58:16.396
I brought you something.

653
00:58:16.496 --> 00:58:19.519
I didn't make it.
It used to belong to my mother.


654
00:58:19.619 --> 00:58:23.672
- Oh, no, no, no, I can't accept this.
- No, I want you to have it.


655
00:58:24.772 --> 00:58:27.541
My mother wasn't a whore
like Grandmother says.


656
00:58:27.641 --> 00:58:31.524
She just liked having sex,
and it's okay to like having sex.


657
00:58:33.781 --> 00:58:35.325
Mm-hm.

658
00:58:37.491 --> 00:58:41.421
Isabel, please don't go.
Please don't leave me here with her.


659
00:58:41.521 --> 00:58:43.991
Stay just a little bit longer, please?

660
00:58:44.691 --> 00:58:48.395
I'm... I'm sorry, sweetie,
we really do have to go back home.


661
00:58:48.495 --> 00:58:50.178
Owen and I have to leave.

662
00:58:50.698 --> 00:58:53.002
But if you... if you stay...

663
00:58:53.102 --> 00:58:57.305
...Owen can apologize to me
for making me like this, like he wanted.


664
00:58:58.405 --> 00:58:59.907
Sorry.

665
00:59:00.507 --> 00:59:03.151
I'm glad we got
a chance to be here.

666
00:59:55.763 --> 01:00:00.404
Violet... what a... what a pleasant surprise.

667
01:00:06.607 --> 01:00:09.777
- How's Pearl?
- Oh, queer as ever.


668
01:00:09.877 --> 01:00:13.367
Well, we just need to keep praying
for her, then, don't we?


669
01:00:13.467 --> 01:00:19.983
She's got a thing for my Grandson's
girlfriend. It's pathetic.


670
01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:23.056
So your family's still in town, then?
How wonderful is that.


671
01:00:23.156 --> 01:00:26.594
I've started seeing things again.

672
01:00:27.994 --> 01:00:29.548
What...

673
01:00:31.403 --> 01:00:34.835
- ...what kind of things?
- Horrible things.


674
01:00:35.835 --> 01:00:38.272
God wants them all dead.

675
01:00:38.372 --> 01:00:39.963
Violet...

676
01:00:40.063 --> 01:00:43.440
...what would make you think
God would want anybody dead?


677
01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:48.281
They weren't supposed to survive
the last time around.


678
01:00:48.381 --> 01:00:50.251
None of them.

679
01:00:51.551 --> 01:00:53.153
What are you saying?

680
01:00:53.253 --> 01:00:57.757
I was given specific instructions.

681
01:00:57.857 --> 01:01:01.572
It wanted them all to burn.

682
01:01:01.672 --> 01:01:03.864
And it wanted me to watch.

683
01:01:03.964 --> 01:01:07.701
- And I did.
- Instructions for what?


684
01:01:07.801 --> 01:01:13.382
The boy was semi-coherent at the best
of times so it wasn't difficult...


685
01:01:13.782 --> 01:01:16.476
...to convince him it was his fault.

686
01:01:17.676 --> 01:01:20.648
There was a thrill...

687
01:01:20.748 --> 01:01:23.533
...in hearing my daughter...

688
01:01:23.733 --> 01:01:26.228
...screaming out in agony.

689
01:01:28.088 --> 01:01:33.108
For a brief moment,
and for the first time, I felt...


690
01:01:35.095 --> 01:01:36.693
...pleasure.

691
01:01:37.631 --> 01:01:40.701
The kind of pleasure she must have derived...

692
01:01:40.801 --> 01:01:44.495
...from her innumerable sexual episodes.

693
01:01:46.772 --> 01:01:50.644
And then I knew
that I was doing God's work...


694
01:01:50.744 --> 01:01:54.681
...and he was rewarding me.

695
01:01:54.781 --> 01:01:56.617
Now, Violet...

696
01:01:57.317 --> 01:02:00.354
...you are sorely mistaken if you
think that what you are doing...


697
01:02:00.454 --> 01:02:02.679
...is God's will.

698
01:02:03.256 --> 01:02:07.027
No, you're applying His Holy name
to some kind of personal agenda, no more.


699
01:02:07.127 --> 01:02:11.189
- What you're doing is a kind of sacrilege.
- No, no, no.


700
01:02:11.887 --> 01:02:14.383
After I convinced Owen...

701
01:02:15.183 --> 01:02:19.985
...that he had improperly
installed the heating system...


702
01:02:20.785 --> 01:02:23.476
...he was so consumed with guilt...

703
01:02:23.576 --> 01:02:26.180
...I thought he would take his own life.

704
01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:30.019
Instead of which, he ran away.

705
01:02:32.786 --> 01:02:37.457
But I knew he'd come
back one day for Pearl.

706
01:02:38.257 --> 01:02:42.934
My voices told me, and now he's back.

707
01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:47.267
And they want me
to finish what I started.

708
01:02:48.267 --> 01:02:50.537
Now, Violet, you listen to me.

709
01:02:51.137 --> 01:02:55.281
These voices you're hearing,
they are a delusion.


710
01:02:55.381 --> 01:02:58.945
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to contact the authorities.


711
01:02:59.045 --> 01:03:01.285
You will do no such thing.

712
01:03:01.385 --> 01:03:03.650
I'm afraid I have no choice.

713
01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:08.955
Not unless you want them to find out...

714
01:03:09.055 --> 01:03:13.198
...what you did to my daughter.

715
01:03:16.729 --> 01:03:19.567
She was 15, Sterling.

716
01:03:21.188 --> 01:03:23.645
She wasn't born a whore.

717
01:03:23.745 --> 01:03:26.212
But you turned her into one.

718
01:03:29.008 --> 01:03:31.678
Come now, Sterling...

719
01:03:32.878 --> 01:03:35.334
...I thought you'd be excited to...

720
01:03:35.434 --> 01:03:38.989
...sit back and relax...

721
01:03:39.089 --> 01:03:42.667
...and watch a true vessel of God...

722
01:03:42.767 --> 01:03:45.053
...do His work.

723
01:04:29.269 --> 01:04:31.950
Violet, I have to...

724
01:04:34.341 --> 01:04:35.821
Violet?

725
01:04:40.914 --> 01:04:42.390
Violet!

726
01:04:55.795 --> 01:04:59.366
I just gave Pearl some of my makeup,
so she could look nice for you.


727
01:04:59.466 --> 01:05:01.393
- She's putting it on right now.
- Really?


728
01:05:01.493 --> 01:05:04.038
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.


729
01:05:05.538 --> 01:05:08.014
Lovely day, isn't it?

730
01:05:12.478 --> 01:05:16.615
I'm gonna finish this coffee and then spend
the next hour trying to relieve myself.


731
01:05:16.715 --> 01:05:19.186
I didn't know pregnancy
made you so constipated.


732
01:05:19.286 --> 01:05:23.369
There is such a thing
as too much information, dear.


733
01:05:53.286 --> 01:05:56.390
- Grandma, what was that?
- A regular occurrence.


734
01:05:56.490 --> 01:06:00.151
- That's it! No more mirrors!
- I'm gonna go check on her.


735
01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:03.274
- I'll go with you.
- No, please, I'd rather go alone.


736
01:06:13.773 --> 01:06:15.210
Pearl?

737
01:06:18.545 --> 01:06:20.548
Pearl, are you okay?

738
01:06:21.648 --> 01:06:24.951
- I think so.
- What happened?


739
01:06:25.051 --> 01:06:29.530
Isabel let me borrow her makeup
because I wanted to look pretty for you...


740
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:32.659
- ...and then I got sad.
- I don't care about looks, Pearl.


741
01:06:32.759 --> 01:06:36.667
It's not important to me.
However, I am a little concerned...


742
01:06:36.767 --> 01:06:40.968
...about all the bad luck you're accruing
on account of these broken mirrors.


743
01:06:42.068 --> 01:06:45.906
I think I maxed out
on bad luck for one lifetime.


744
01:06:47.106 --> 01:06:49.943
Come back tonight when it's dark out.
We'll talk then.


745
01:06:50.043 --> 01:06:54.614
Oh, come on, Pearl, don't make me wait
another night. Pearl, open the door.


746
01:06:57.617 --> 01:07:00.287
Do you have any reading material
other than the Bible?


747
01:07:00.387 --> 01:07:02.556
I just finished what I brought
and it doesn't feel right...


748
01:07:02.656 --> 01:07:04.725
...reading the Holy book on the toilet.

749
01:07:05.225 --> 01:07:08.635
It's nice to know you have some dignity.

750
01:07:11.464 --> 01:07:13.734
Why do you hate me so much?

751
01:07:14.434 --> 01:07:16.733
You remind me of my daughter.

752
01:07:17.203 --> 01:07:19.272
The so-called whore?

753
01:07:19.372 --> 01:07:24.832
Anyone who would have sex
with Owen can't be too discerning.


754
01:07:26.112 --> 01:07:29.488
Sounds like he had a great
support system growing up.


755
01:07:32.118 --> 01:07:34.992
Are you sure this is his baby?

756
01:07:35.442 --> 01:07:38.825
Excuse me. What exactly are you implying?

757
01:07:38.925 --> 01:07:42.029
Presumably, exactly
what you think I'm implying.


758
01:07:42.129 --> 01:07:44.564
That you've been sleeping around.

759
01:07:45.364 --> 01:07:48.194
Owen is not supposed to be...

760
01:07:49.266 --> 01:07:51.504
...capable of fathering a child.

761
01:07:51.604 --> 01:07:54.974
Well, whatever backwards doctor
told you that was incorrect.


762
01:07:55.074 --> 01:07:57.811
Owen and his college girlfriend
had an abortion.


763
01:07:57.911 --> 01:08:00.947
And I haven't had sex
with anyone else in years.


764
01:08:01.047 --> 01:08:04.856
You can't hide the sexual dissatisfaction.
It's written all over my face.


765
01:08:11.224 --> 01:08:13.036
I believe you.

766
01:08:15.561 --> 01:08:19.566
So it's settled? I'm not a whore
and you no longer hate me?


767
01:08:22.509 --> 01:08:24.471
It appears that you're not a liar.

768
01:08:24.571 --> 01:08:27.495
But you're still a whore...

769
01:08:27.595 --> 01:08:29.787
...and I don't like you.

770
01:08:31.077 --> 01:08:35.186
Well, at least that's a step
in the right direction.


771
01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:37.351
Excuse me.

772
01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:41.765
<i>Gather round, saints and sinners alike,
are you having money trouble?</i>


773
01:08:45.824 --> 01:08:49.262
Grandma, will you please
tell Isabel I'll be right back?


774
01:08:50.062 --> 01:08:51.864
Where are you going?

775
01:08:51.964 --> 01:08:55.202
I was actually going to go visit
the old property.


776
01:08:56.002 --> 01:08:57.810
Uh-huh.

777
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:03.782
Thanks.

778
01:09:08.448 --> 01:09:11.418
<i>God is good! God is great! 
Praise his name!</i>

779
01:09:11.518 --> 01:09:13.987
<i>I'm so excited about this Holy water,
I can barely speak.</i>


780
01:09:14.087 --> 01:09:16.156
<i>What a gift Heaven sent, 
I'm telling you.</i>

781
01:09:16.256 --> 01:09:18.393
<i>Friends, for the mere price...</i>

782
01:09:24.597 --> 01:09:26.866
<i>Woman was created for man...</i>

783
01:09:26.966 --> 01:09:29.269
<i>...the Bible speaks plainly on the subject.</i>

784
01:09:29.369 --> 01:09:32.171
<i>And while an excellent wife
is the crown of her husband...</i>


785
01:09:32.271 --> 01:09:36.548
<i>...make no mistake, she who shames him,
is like rottenness in his bone.</i>


786
01:09:52.592 --> 01:09:53.764
Hey.

787
01:09:58.948 --> 01:10:02.519
My family used to own this land.
There was a house right here in the middle.


788
01:10:02.619 --> 01:10:05.571
You used to live in the house
that burned down?


789
01:10:05.671 --> 01:10:09.365
Sometimes we come at night
with flashlights and try to see ghosts.


790
01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:14.728
I'll tell you what.
If you ever see any of those ghosts...


791
01:10:14.828 --> 01:10:17.703
...do me a favor and tell them
Owen says he's sorry.


792
01:10:24.657 --> 01:10:26.149
See ya, kid.

793
01:11:03.279 --> 01:11:05.020
<i>Due to your loin...</i>

794
01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:09.140
<i>...for the husband is head of the wife
just as Christ is head of the church.</i>


795
01:11:25.418 --> 01:11:31.271
<i>Wives! Submit yourselves
to your husbands and all things.</i>


796
01:11:31.891 --> 01:11:35.732
<i>That is what Christ asks of you.</i>

797
01:11:57.917 --> 01:11:59.697
Oh, my God!

798
01:12:00.252 --> 01:12:02.186
Oh, my God!

799
01:12:19.105 --> 01:12:20.807
Grandmother!

800
01:12:27.046 --> 01:12:29.082
You wicked, wicked child!

801
01:12:29.182 --> 01:12:31.752
Grandma! What happened?

802
01:12:33.052 --> 01:12:36.456
- She...
- Isabel, what the fuck is going on?


803
01:12:37.056 --> 01:12:39.619
That snake was in the toilet.

804
01:12:39.719 --> 01:12:42.494
What? Are you okay?

805
01:12:42.594 --> 01:12:44.197
- Yeah.
- Did it bite you?


806
01:12:44.297 --> 01:12:47.587
No, Pearl... did that.

807
01:12:48.067 --> 01:12:51.905
This is a very old house. It probably
got in through a hole in the pipes.


808
01:12:52.505 --> 01:12:54.507
We can't have an incident like that again.

809
01:12:54.607 --> 01:12:58.478
Now, Owen, you can find
the hole in the pipes.


810
01:12:58.578 --> 01:13:00.580
Okay, what do I have to do?

811
01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:04.684
Get into the crawl space
under the floor, it's very simple.


812
01:13:04.784 --> 01:13:06.519
I'll show you.

813
01:13:06.619 --> 01:13:11.299
Okay, I'm just going to talk to Isabel
for a second. Come here. Come here.


814
01:13:17.864 --> 01:13:21.000
Hey, hey, hey, are you okay? Come here.

815
01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.980
- That was so insane.
- I can imagine.


816
01:13:32.979 --> 01:13:35.348
Why are your eyes like that?

817
01:13:35.448 --> 01:13:38.284
- Allergies.
- Have you been crying?


818
01:13:39.284 --> 01:13:41.035
Maybe.

819
01:13:41.135 --> 01:13:43.176
You know it's okay to be sensitive.

820
01:13:43.556 --> 01:13:46.292
I know. I'm just
not particularly used to it.

821
01:13:50.362 --> 01:13:54.267
- You remember the first time we met?
- Bits and pieces.


822
01:13:54.367 --> 01:13:57.670
You were the biggest piece of shit
douche bag I've ever met in my life.


823
01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:01.290
- I could not stand you.
- I tend to give off that first impression.


824
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:04.674
And second, and third, fourth.

825
01:14:06.044 --> 01:14:08.650
But when I ran
into you that fifth time...

826
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:11.684
- ...something clicked.
- Well, you were lonely.


827
01:14:11.784 --> 01:14:13.821
Well, you were drunk.

828
01:14:15.021 --> 01:14:18.834
It's crazy... now you're pregnant.

829
01:14:27.566 --> 01:14:30.087
I want to have this baby with you.

830
01:14:32.904 --> 01:14:34.746
Me, too.

831
01:14:35.041 --> 01:14:38.248
- So, it's settled?
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.


832
01:14:41.781 --> 01:14:43.783
- Okay, I'm gonna go help Grandma.
- Okay.


833
01:14:43.883 --> 01:14:46.853
Make amends with Pearl
and first thing in the fucking morning...


834
01:14:46.953 --> 01:14:49.422
- ...we're getting out of here.
- Amen.


835
01:14:49.522 --> 01:14:51.098
Owen?

836
01:14:52.958 --> 01:14:54.994
- Owen?
- Yeah! I'm here, Grandma.


837
01:14:55.094 --> 01:14:56.938
Oh, hurry up.

838
01:14:57.997 --> 01:14:59.532
- Okay.
- Here you are.


839
01:14:59.632 --> 01:15:01.868
- Yeah, what is this?
- It's an oil lamp.


840
01:15:01.968 --> 01:15:03.903
Yeah, I can see that.
Don't you have a flashlight?


841
01:15:04.003 --> 01:15:06.205
- No.
- Great.


842
01:15:06.305 --> 01:15:09.175
If it was good enough for your ancestors,
it's good enough for you.


843
01:15:09.275 --> 01:15:11.144
I don't know if I subscribe
to that philosophy.


844
01:15:11.244 --> 01:15:14.147
These old, arthritic hands
are not good anymore.


845
01:15:14.247 --> 01:15:16.055
Give it to me.

846
01:15:19.852 --> 01:15:21.657
There, see?

847
01:15:25.024 --> 01:15:26.225
Good.

848
01:15:26.325 --> 01:15:30.557
- I think it's like this. There you go.
- Nice job, that's right. Now...


849
01:15:31.357 --> 01:15:35.968
Let's get this done. Wait. 
What am I doing?

850
01:15:36.068 --> 01:15:39.538
Oh, just follow the piping
along the floor to the back.


851
01:15:39.638 --> 01:15:43.442
And then, any holes you find,
just wrap them up with the tape.


852
01:15:43.542 --> 01:15:47.184
It's just a temporary measure,
but it's better than nothing.


853
01:16:31.991 --> 01:16:34.436
Ah... okay.

854
01:16:44.403 --> 01:16:47.410
No, no holes, Grandma!

855
01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:50.318
Okay, I'm coming back up.

856
01:17:03.889 --> 01:17:08.294
It's disgusting down here. Thanks for the
solid reminder never to be a homeowner.


857
01:17:08.394 --> 01:17:13.600
- What's that smell?
- Oh, I spilled the lamp oil. Clumsy me.


858
01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:17.337
I'm gonna go freshen up and get ready.
Isabel and I are leaving in the morning.


859
01:17:17.437 --> 01:17:22.475
Oh, well, I'm going to make
a really nice last dinner.


860
01:17:22.575 --> 01:17:26.145
- I'll have Isabel come help.
- No. I cook alone, Owen.


861
01:17:26.245 --> 01:17:29.482
Now, as I recall,
you like chicken and biscuits, hm?


862
01:17:29.582 --> 01:17:33.519
I'm actually trying to be healthy,
so maybe something lighter.


863
01:17:33.619 --> 01:17:37.690
Well, why bother? You're just going
to throw it up anyway, Owen.


864
01:17:38.690 --> 01:17:40.738
I'm gonna go try and see Pearl.

865
01:17:45.564 --> 01:17:47.318
Damn!

866
01:17:58.778 --> 01:18:00.581
Pearl, it's me.

867
01:18:01.981 --> 01:18:04.598
I'm leaving and we don't have much time.

868
01:18:07.937 --> 01:18:09.412
Please.

869
01:18:15.027 --> 01:18:16.869
Come in.

870
01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:30.713
Sit down.

871
01:18:51.397 --> 01:18:53.666
I wasn't even supposed to be there.

872
01:18:54.766 --> 01:18:57.069
What are you talking about?

873
01:18:57.169 --> 01:18:59.239
The evening of the fire.

874
01:18:59.989 --> 01:19:02.659
I was supposed to be staying at Emily's.

875
01:19:03.609 --> 01:19:08.014
Grandmother caught us kissing and told
Mother and Father, and I was grounded.


876
01:19:08.614 --> 01:19:11.050
I'm sorry, I don't remember Emily.

877
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:13.553
It doesn't matter.

878
01:19:13.953 --> 01:19:17.490
She's married now, has two boys.

879
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:20.193
I'm sorry to hear that.

880
01:19:20.593 --> 01:19:23.475
It's okay. She seems happy.

881
01:19:26.098 --> 01:19:28.552
When was the last time you two spoke?

882
01:19:31.103 --> 01:19:32.917
Not since the fire.

883
01:19:35.574 --> 01:19:39.387
I had third-degree burns
over 80% of my body.

884
01:19:41.047 --> 01:19:43.582
I spent many months in the hospital.

885
01:19:43.682 --> 01:19:46.153
No one came to visit me, but Grandmother.

886
01:19:47.553 --> 01:19:49.593
Has she been taking care of you?

887
01:19:52.658 --> 01:19:55.094
She thinks she can talk to God.

888
01:19:55.794 --> 01:19:58.497
Sometimes he tells her to do terrible things.

889
01:19:58.597 --> 01:20:00.863
She hasn't hurt you though, right?

890
01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:03.610
No. Not me.

891
01:20:10.576 --> 01:20:13.178
- Owen?
- Yes.


892
01:20:13.778 --> 01:20:15.850
You're a very lucky man.

893
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:20.387
You shouldn't take things for granted.

894
01:20:21.547 --> 01:20:23.459
I'm working on that.

895
01:20:30.829 --> 01:20:33.294
I would have made a great mother.

896
01:20:35.134 --> 01:20:38.971
I would have understood things, you know?

897
01:20:39.071 --> 01:20:43.409
I would have taken care of my babies.

898
01:20:44.409 --> 01:20:48.581
- I would have protected them.
- Pearl, you can still be a mother.


899
01:20:49.081 --> 01:20:52.495
Why'd you leave me, Owen? Why?

900
01:20:55.421 --> 01:20:58.229
I don't... I can't say. I don't know.

901
01:21:00.292 --> 01:21:04.430
All I can say is it's been
eating me up ever since...


902
01:21:04.530 --> 01:21:06.026
...and...

903
01:21:06.579 --> 01:21:09.225
...I need to ask for your forgiveness.

904
01:21:10.052 --> 01:21:12.525
Okay, I need you to forgive me, Pearl.

905
01:21:14.807 --> 01:21:16.347
Okay?

906
01:21:37.162 --> 01:21:39.435
I don't forgive you, Owen.

907
01:21:41.867 --> 01:21:44.909
I don't forgive you, and I never will.

908
01:21:45.009 --> 01:21:46.539
Pearl.

909
01:21:46.639 --> 01:21:49.876
Let Isabel and I take you
away from this place.


910
01:21:51.276 --> 01:21:53.612
This is where I belong now.

911
01:21:53.712 --> 01:21:56.382
Pearl, it's not too late, okay?
We can get out of here.


912
01:21:56.482 --> 01:22:01.556
This... is where I belong now.

913
01:22:05.658 --> 01:22:07.860
This is where I belong now.

914
01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.765
- No, Pearl. We'll take good care of you.
- Get out!


915
01:22:11.065 --> 01:22:14.491
Get out! Get out! Get out!

916
01:23:24.536 --> 01:23:28.007
- Hey... shh, it's me.
- I was asleep.


917
01:23:28.107 --> 01:23:30.409
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?

918
01:23:30.509 --> 01:23:32.311
I'm over that couch.

919
01:23:32.411 --> 01:23:36.482
- Aren't you worried about your grandmother?
- She can go fuck herself.


920
01:23:36.782 --> 01:23:39.191
All I care about is
right here in this room.

921
01:23:43.489 --> 01:23:45.340
Hold on.

922
01:23:45.724 --> 01:23:47.531
I'll be right back.

923
01:24:45.884 --> 01:24:48.554
- What's going on?
- I don't know.


924
01:24:49.804 --> 01:24:52.073
I'm feeling a little light-headed.

925
01:24:52.473 --> 01:24:57.165
- Did you take your medicine?
- Shit, no, they're in the drawer there.


926
01:24:59.465 --> 01:25:00.909
Thanks.

927
01:25:02.534 --> 01:25:06.438
- Should probably eat something.
- Yeah, come on, I'll make you a sandwich.


928
01:25:06.538 --> 01:25:08.052
Okay.

929
01:25:23.422 --> 01:25:25.237
Oh, fuck.

930
01:25:30.396 --> 01:25:32.452
Call an ambulance.

931
01:25:32.552 --> 01:25:36.168
This doesn't make any sense.
His new medication's been helping so much.


932
01:25:36.268 --> 01:25:39.945
- He's been so much better.
- No, let him rot.


933
01:25:40.705 --> 01:25:43.342
What did you just say, you crazy bitch?

934
01:25:43.842 --> 01:25:46.338
If Owen dies, I'll kill you myself.

935
01:25:46.438 --> 01:25:50.849
Oh, I'm afraid you and your baby
are going with him.


936
01:25:50.949 --> 01:25:52.985
And then it's over.

937
01:25:53.485 --> 01:25:55.559
This is where it ends.

938
01:26:00.792 --> 01:26:03.739
How many times do
I have to say it?

939
01:26:05.898 --> 01:26:09.779
No... more... fighting.

940
01:26:11.370 --> 01:26:12.407
Pearl!
