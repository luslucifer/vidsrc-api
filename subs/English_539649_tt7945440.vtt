Where's your friend?


161
00:09:19.745 --> 00:09:22.748
- Oh, my God.
- Wait.


162
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:24.207
Dad.

163
00:09:31.423 --> 00:09:33.008
Britney!

164
00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:36.386
Daddy!

165
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.388
Britney!

166
00:09:38.472 --> 00:09:40.474
Daddy!

167
00:09:43.226 --> 00:09:44.853
Daddy.

168
00:09:44.936 --> 00:09:46.688
Daddy!

169
00:09:48.774 --> 00:09:51.610
- Britney!
- Daddy!


170
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.162
Daddy!

171
00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:07.876
Britney!

172
00:10:10.545 --> 00:10:15.467
Call 911! Call 911!

173
00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.969
Hey, Dad. Dad.

174
00:10:18.053 --> 00:10:19.429
Dad.

175
00:10:22.682 --> 00:10:24.726
- Dad, wait.
- What's the code to your phone?


176
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:26.228
What's the code?
What's the fucking code?


177
00:10:26.311 --> 00:10:28.480
Come on, what's the code
to your phone? Kayla.


178
00:10:28.563 --> 00:10:31.775
- Come on!
- I pushed her.


179
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.990
She was...
She was being a bitch!


180
00:10:39.074 --> 00:10:41.326
- She was just being a bitch!
- No, no, no, no, no, no.


181
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:43.745
No, no, no. No.

182
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:46.623
I pushed her
and she fell.


183
00:10:46.706 --> 00:10:51.336
I... I pushed...
I pushed her and she fell.


184
00:10:54.256 --> 00:10:55.173
Get down. Get down.

185
00:11:14.693 --> 00:11:16.486
Okay, get in the car.

186
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.864
Come on, come on.

187
00:12:24.054 --> 00:12:28.725
I want the depo served as soon
as I get those, uh, responses.


188
00:12:28.808 --> 00:12:31.853
Can I call you back? Okay.

189
00:12:33.438 --> 00:12:34.814
Where's Kayla?

190
00:12:36.441 --> 00:12:39.486
Um, she's in the car.

191
00:12:39.569 --> 00:12:42.447
- Damn it, Jay. Don't tell me...
- Listen to me for a second.


192
00:12:42.531 --> 00:12:44.032
- ...she talked you out of going again.
- We need to...


193
00:12:44.115 --> 00:12:45.367
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Listen to me.


194
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.369
We need to talk.

195
00:12:47.452 --> 00:12:49.746
<i>Rebecca.</i>

196
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:51.498
- Goddamn it, hold on.
- Should've dropped her off myself.


197
00:12:51.581 --> 00:12:52.541
Just hold on a minute.

198
00:12:52.624 --> 00:12:53.917
- She needs to be there.
- Hey.


199
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.377
I'm serious.
We have to talk.


200
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.546
Talk about what, Jay?

201
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.966
She's nothing
but a spoiled little brat


202
00:13:01.049 --> 00:13:03.969
because you let her
get away with everything.


203
00:13:08.974 --> 00:13:11.560
Hey, you're right.
I'll take her on the retreat.


204
00:13:14.521 --> 00:13:15.814
Kayla?

205
00:13:19.442 --> 00:13:21.570
- I told you to stay in the car.
- Jay.


206
00:13:21.653 --> 00:13:24.739
I can't-can't breathe.
Please.


207
00:13:24.823 --> 00:13:26.449
- Where's your inhaler?
- I don't know.


208
00:13:26.533 --> 00:13:27.909
I put a new one
in your bag.


209
00:13:27.993 --> 00:13:29.995
I looked in my, in my bag,
I can't find it.


210
00:13:30.078 --> 00:13:31.997
It's gotta be there. Gotta
be there. Come on. Come on.


211
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.665
Let's look.

212
00:13:36.209 --> 00:13:38.211
Okay. Okay. I got this. I got this.
- Please, no.


213
00:13:38.295 --> 00:13:39.921
She just needs to lie down
and get some rest.


214
00:13:40.005 --> 00:13:41.131
Let's go back to my loft.

215
00:13:41.214 --> 00:13:43.675
- Okay? Yes.
- No, no. No, Dad.


216
00:13:43.758 --> 00:13:45.760
I don't want to, I don't want
to go there. Trini's there.


217
00:13:45.844 --> 00:13:47.387
I just want to go home.

218
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.431
- Come on. No, no, no, no, no.
- Come on. Step over.


219
00:13:49.514 --> 00:13:51.600
- I'm bringing her to the house.
- No.


220
00:13:51.683 --> 00:13:54.477
For God's sakes, Jay.

221
00:14:14.581 --> 00:14:16.458
Dad?

222
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:19.377
Do you think she's pretty?

223
00:14:26.468 --> 00:14:27.761
It's the ballet school.

224
00:14:27.844 --> 00:14:29.846
Tell them she's sick.

225
00:14:32.307 --> 00:14:35.268
Hi. Yes, I know.

226
00:14:35.352 --> 00:14:37.937
Lindsey,
I'm sorry...


227
00:14:38.021 --> 00:14:39.981
I really appreciate
your understanding.


228
00:14:40.065 --> 00:14:42.651
Okay, bye.

229
00:14:42.734 --> 00:14:45.904
- What did you tell them?
- What do you think I told them?


230
00:14:45.987 --> 00:14:47.947
If you need to get back,
I can stay with her.


231
00:14:48.031 --> 00:14:50.825
No, it's fine.
I can work from home.


232
00:14:50.909 --> 00:14:52.619
What happened to your hand?

233
00:14:52.702 --> 00:14:57.540
Uh, was cutting drywall.

234
00:14:57.624 --> 00:14:59.626
Maybe I should take her
back to my place.


235
00:14:59.709 --> 00:15:02.545
- It's closer to Gresham.
- No, I'm gonna drop her off tomorrow.


236
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:04.798
And you need to make sure
that you always have


237
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:07.050
an inhaler with you
at all times, in your car.


238
00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:10.011
She could get
in serious trouble without it.


239
00:15:12.681 --> 00:15:14.641
What?

240
00:15:17.644 --> 00:15:19.896
Kayla?

241
00:15:23.942 --> 00:15:27.028
Kayla?

242
00:15:27.112 --> 00:15:29.280
- What are you doing?
- Taking a bath.


243
00:15:29.364 --> 00:15:30.990
- Do you mind?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.


244
00:15:31.074 --> 00:15:32.951
- Excuse us.
- Hey-- I just need to talk...


245
00:15:33.034 --> 00:15:35.036
- I'll be right outside.
- Jay.


246
00:15:40.208 --> 00:15:41.751
What's going on?

247
00:15:56.057 --> 00:16:00.103
I do not know what
is going on with you two,

248
00:16:00.186 --> 00:16:02.814
but you're going
to that retreat tomorrow.


249
00:16:04.566 --> 00:16:06.151
What is this?

250
00:16:06.234 --> 00:16:09.529
Kayla, I just bought this.

251
00:16:09.612 --> 00:16:11.948
You've got to learn to take
better care of your things.


252
00:16:12.031 --> 00:16:13.867
You're not a child anymore.

253
00:16:15.285 --> 00:16:16.578
Stop it.

254
00:16:16.661 --> 00:16:19.289
How did this happen?

255
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:12.717
We need a lawyer, a good one.

256
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:16.554
That defense attorney that you
argued the Walker case against.


257
00:17:16.638 --> 00:17:18.056
He's the best.
What's his name?


258
00:17:18.139 --> 00:17:19.682
Edelman, Edelstein?

259
00:17:19.766 --> 00:17:23.353
I don't, I don't understand
how this could happen.


260
00:17:23.436 --> 00:17:24.896
I mean,
you shouldn't have left.


261
00:17:26.439 --> 00:17:28.149
You shouldn't have
just driven away.


262
00:17:28.233 --> 00:17:29.984
What was I supposed to do?
Call the cops?


263
00:17:30.068 --> 00:17:32.028
You know better than that.
Come on.


264
00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:33.363
Think.

265
00:17:33.446 --> 00:17:35.782
We need a lawyer,
someone to help her.


266
00:17:35.865 --> 00:17:39.077
But then, what? I mean,
they're not gonna plea this out.


267
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.870
Helmes is
a law-and-order type.


268
00:17:40.954 --> 00:17:43.873
He's the city prosecutor.
He'll make an example of her.


269
00:17:43.957 --> 00:17:45.667
He-- I mean,
he'll try her as an adult.


270
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.752
As an adult?
That's ridiculous.


271
00:17:47.836 --> 00:17:49.337
She's 15 years old.

272
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.591
But they were arguing
before it happened.


273
00:17:53.675 --> 00:17:57.595
So he'll say that it was
intentional, with malice.


274
00:17:57.679 --> 00:17:59.556
That's second-degree murder.

275
00:17:59.639 --> 00:18:02.892
But it wasn't intentional.
It was an accident.


276
00:18:02.976 --> 00:18:05.353
Jay, she pushed her.

277
00:18:19.784 --> 00:18:21.870
- Where are you going?
- Going to the river.


278
00:18:21.953 --> 00:18:24.330
- I'm going to find her.
- No. No, that's not gonna happen.


279
00:18:24.414 --> 00:18:26.457
- Sit down.
- I have to find her, and then this all goes away.


280
00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:28.793
And she could be alive, Jay.
She could be alive.


281
00:18:28.877 --> 00:18:31.880
- She could be alive in that...
- No, no, no, no. She's dead.


282
00:18:31.963 --> 00:18:34.757
She's dead.

283
00:18:36.926 --> 00:18:39.345
Hey, hey, hey.

284
00:18:42.515 --> 00:18:44.642
The fall
would've broken her neck.


285
00:18:44.726 --> 00:18:46.936
Okay?

286
00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.773
And even if somehow
she survived... she drowned.


287
00:18:50.857 --> 00:18:54.068
Hypothermia would kill her.

288
00:18:54.152 --> 00:18:56.571
Get out.

289
00:18:56.654 --> 00:19:01.784
Whatever you want to believe,
I know my daughter.


290
00:19:01.868 --> 00:19:05.538
She didn't,
she didn't mean it.


291
00:19:05.622 --> 00:19:07.457
She can't have
her life ruined.


292
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:10.710
All right? Look at me.

293
00:19:10.793 --> 00:19:12.712
Look at me.

294
00:19:12.795 --> 00:19:16.132
There's nothing that we
can do for that girl.

295
00:19:16.215 --> 00:19:18.009
We have to help Kayla.
Okay?


296
00:19:18.092 --> 00:19:21.471
No one saw us.
No one knows that she was there.


297
00:19:21.554 --> 00:19:25.141
So we don't tell anyone.

298
00:19:29.145 --> 00:19:31.105
God.

299
00:19:34.817 --> 00:19:38.321
I need to know that you're
on board with this, please.


300
00:19:53.378 --> 00:19:55.755
Please go.

301
00:22:29.283 --> 00:22:30.493
Hey, Mom?

302
00:22:32.912 --> 00:22:35.081
What is there to eat?

303
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.753
Do you want me to make eggs?

304
00:22:40.837 --> 00:22:42.755
Sure.

305
00:23:06.571 --> 00:23:08.531
Thanks.

306
00:23:25.256 --> 00:23:27.466
Must be your dad.

307
00:23:30.094 --> 00:23:31.512
Hey, Dad.

308
00:23:31.596 --> 00:23:33.598
We're making breakfast.
Have you eaten yet?


309
00:23:33.681 --> 00:23:36.893
Hey, Mom,
Dad hasn't eaten breakfast yet.


310
00:23:36.976 --> 00:23:38.936
He's welcome to eat with us.

311
00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:50.656
I'm gonna make eggs
with jalapeños... and Gouda.


312
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.202
My favorite.

313
00:23:54.285 --> 00:23:57.038
Okay.

314
00:24:19.101 --> 00:24:21.020
She seems okay.
That's good.


315
00:24:22.647 --> 00:24:24.982
- How can she act so normal?
- She's in shock.


316
00:24:25.066 --> 00:24:28.361
How do you expect her to act?
Hmm?


317
00:24:28.444 --> 00:24:29.862
I don't know.

318
00:24:33.074 --> 00:24:36.244
You're sure,
you are positive,


319
00:24:36.327 --> 00:24:37.745
that nobody saw you?

320
00:24:37.828 --> 00:24:39.372
We were in the middle
of nowhere.


321
00:24:39.455 --> 00:24:42.708
There was...
There was no one around.


322
00:24:42.792 --> 00:24:44.210
What?

323
00:24:46.379 --> 00:24:48.339
It isn't an issue,
it's just...


324
00:24:48.422 --> 00:24:49.590
there was a truck
on the road,


325
00:24:49.674 --> 00:24:51.342
- but he didn't see us.
- Oh, my God.


326
00:24:51.425 --> 00:24:53.094
No-no.
He was speeding, okay?


327
00:24:53.177 --> 00:24:54.762
He wasn't paying attention.
He didn't see her,


328
00:24:54.845 --> 00:24:56.305
because we were hiding
behind the car.


329
00:24:56.389 --> 00:24:59.267
- Jay, he saw the fucking car?
- Listen to me.


330
00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:02.186
Kayla was never there.

331
00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:04.772
Okay?
She got sick at my house,


332
00:25:04.855 --> 00:25:06.315
and I went to the office
to get the inhaler,


333
00:25:06.399 --> 00:25:08.401
and then we brought
her back here. End of story.


334
00:25:11.028 --> 00:25:12.697
Right, we just go on
with our lives?


335
00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.323
Yeah,
that's exactly what we do.


336
00:25:14.407 --> 00:25:15.992
Because we're not
turning her in.


337
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.120
That's your daughter.

338
00:25:21.372 --> 00:25:23.374
- I know that.
- Act like it.


339
00:25:27.253 --> 00:25:29.338
It was her she was
talking about yesterday,


340
00:25:29.422 --> 00:25:31.465
when she said you thought
she was pretty?


341
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:33.426
- That was Britney, wasn't it?
- Oh, my God.


342
00:25:33.509 --> 00:25:35.594
Is that why they were fighting?

343
00:25:35.678 --> 00:25:37.179
'Cause of you?

344
00:25:37.263 --> 00:25:38.973
Don't you walk away
from me, Jay.


345
00:25:39.056 --> 00:25:41.225
Why were they fighting?
You answer me.


346
00:25:41.309 --> 00:25:43.185
She didn't do it on purpose.
Is that what you think?


347
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:45.104
- That she meant to hurt her?
- I don't know.


348
00:25:45.187 --> 00:25:46.772
I don't know
what I think anymore.


349
00:25:46.856 --> 00:25:48.274
Just always the absolute

350
00:25:48.357 --> 00:25:51.068
fucking worst
about your own daughter.


351
00:25:52.611 --> 00:25:54.530
Kayla?

352
00:25:54.613 --> 00:25:57.783
Kayla? Kayla.

353
00:25:57.867 --> 00:25:59.452
Jay, where is she going?

354
00:25:59.535 --> 00:26:01.704
- Kayla!
- Kayla?


355
00:26:01.787 --> 00:26:03.247
What--
What are you doing?


356
00:26:03.331 --> 00:26:05.166
- This way. Come on.
- No! No!


357
00:26:05.249 --> 00:26:08.294
No! I hate you!

358
00:26:08.377 --> 00:26:10.046
Jay, get her inside!

359
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:14.884
Stop her, Jay!

360
00:26:17.178 --> 00:26:19.430
- Please get her inside!
- Let go!


361
00:26:19.513 --> 00:26:22.600
- Stop it!
- It wasn't an accident!


362
00:26:22.683 --> 00:26:25.728
I did it on purpose!
I pushed her because of you!


363
00:26:25.811 --> 00:26:27.396
I fucking did it
because of you!


364
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.565
Shut up!
You shut up! Shut up!


365
00:26:29.648 --> 00:26:30.649
Jay! Jay!

366
00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.741
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

367
00:26:38.824 --> 00:26:42.244
- I'm sorry.
- She didn't mean it.


368
00:26:42.328 --> 00:26:43.954
Don't leave. Jay!
Jay, don't go!


369
00:26:49.001 --> 00:26:50.586
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.


370
00:27:58.612 --> 00:28:00.072
Hey, Rebecca.

371
00:28:00.156 --> 00:28:03.159
Bet they thought they were gonna
get away with this, huh?


372
00:28:04.827 --> 00:28:06.662
Excuse me?

373
00:28:06.745 --> 00:28:08.289
I thought you knew.

374
00:28:08.372 --> 00:28:10.541
Britney and Kayla, they didn't
make it to the dance camp.


375
00:28:10.624 --> 00:28:11.876
Didn't the school call you?

376
00:28:11.959 --> 00:28:14.879
Uh, no. Kayla's sick.

377
00:28:14.962 --> 00:28:17.256
I kept her home
this weekend.


378
00:28:17.339 --> 00:28:21.677
Huh.
I was sure they were...


379
00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.013
doing this thing together.
You know how they are


380
00:28:24.096 --> 00:28:27.683
- with their plans and secrets and stuff.
- Yes.


381
00:28:31.562 --> 00:28:33.772
I did something stupid,
you know?


382
00:28:33.856 --> 00:28:37.693
I... I told her
to take the bus up there.


383
00:28:37.776 --> 00:28:39.278
We were fighting, and...

384
00:28:39.361 --> 00:28:41.739
she tried to run out
of the house, I grabbed her.


385
00:28:41.822 --> 00:28:43.616
- She fell.
- Oh.


386
00:28:43.699 --> 00:28:46.243
Oh, it was just awful.

387
00:28:46.327 --> 00:28:49.705
I guess she was
punishing old Dad, right?


388
00:28:49.788 --> 00:28:50.664
Yeah.

389
00:28:52.374 --> 00:28:54.919
Don't worry, Sam. I'm sure
she's just playing hooky


390
00:28:55.002 --> 00:28:56.462
- or something.
- Yeah?


391
00:28:56.545 --> 00:28:57.463
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


392
00:28:59.423 --> 00:29:01.467
Yeah. Okay.
Yeah, you're right.


393
00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.427
I mean, it's not like she hasn't
done this before, right?


394
00:29:03.511 --> 00:29:05.095
- Yeah.
- A lot?


395
00:29:05.179 --> 00:29:06.388
Okay. I'm sorry.

396
00:29:06.472 --> 00:29:07.848
I'm sorry to have
bothered you about it.


397
00:29:07.932 --> 00:29:10.142
- No, no problem.
- I-I hope Kayla feels better.


398
00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:11.101
Bye.

399
00:29:13.604 --> 00:29:16.148
Oh. Actually, um...

400
00:29:16.232 --> 00:29:18.484
do you think I could talk
to Kayla for a second?


401
00:29:18.567 --> 00:29:20.444
You said she was home,
right?


402
00:29:20.528 --> 00:29:22.947
Um, she went out.
Her dad took her to the doctor.


403
00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:26.033
Okay. Uh, can she call me
when she's back?


404
00:29:26.116 --> 00:29:28.452
- I don't want to impose.
- No. Of course.


405
00:29:28.536 --> 00:29:30.538
Uh, she'll call you.
I have your number.


406
00:29:30.621 --> 00:29:33.791
Okay. Let me give you
my-my work cell. Just in case.


407
00:29:33.874 --> 00:29:35.376
Sure.

408
00:29:35.459 --> 00:29:38.045
- Um, what is it?
- Um... Jesus.


409
00:29:38.128 --> 00:29:39.797
It's really cold
out here, right?


410
00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.258
- Yeah, sorry.
- Here, let me do that.


411
00:29:42.341 --> 00:29:46.345
So three more years and, uh,
they're off to college, right?


412
00:29:47.972 --> 00:29:50.182
I can't wait.
There you go.


413
00:29:52.101 --> 00:29:55.187
Okay. Thanks, and, uh,
I hope she feels better.


414
00:30:02.778 --> 00:30:05.739
Oh, my God.

415
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:56.582
Jay? Where are you?

416
00:30:56.665 --> 00:30:58.417
I've been calling you
all morning.


417
00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.337
Her dad came by the house,
and he wants to talk to Kayla.


418
00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.424
Call me when you get this,
please.


419
00:31:05.507 --> 00:31:07.635
Fuck.

420
00:32:03.691 --> 00:32:06.985
<i>No, we're not</i>
<i>doing a song about a centipede!</i>

423
00:32:15.536 --> 00:32:18.247
- Kayla?
- Hmm?


424
00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:20.332
Um, you need to call her dad.

425
00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:24.586
Tell him that you
don't know where she is.

426
00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:26.797
That you've been sick,
and that's why you missed the retreat.

You call him right now.

437
00:32:51.655 --> 00:32:52.948
No.

438
00:33:24.772 --> 00:33:26.648
Shh.

439
00:34:17.991 --> 00:34:19.201
Rebecca?

440
00:34:19.284 --> 00:34:20.953
Daddy!

441
00:34:21.036 --> 00:34:23.580
Daddy, we're right here.

442
00:34:23.664 --> 00:34:26.834
Whoa-- Oh.
What's going on?


443
00:34:26.917 --> 00:34:30.045
He's an engineer.
He's divorced.


444
00:34:30.128 --> 00:34:33.131
His wife left him. They moved
here, like, three months ago,


445
00:34:33.215 --> 00:34:35.926
or two, maybe.

446
00:34:36.009 --> 00:34:38.637
You know, at first
it was really nice.


447
00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.223
She had a friend finally,
and they were going out,


448
00:34:41.306 --> 00:34:42.683
- and she was happy...
- He-he-he said


449
00:34:42.766 --> 00:34:44.268
that he fought with Britney?
What about?


450
00:34:44.351 --> 00:34:46.687
I don't know.
He didn't say.


451
00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:48.355
Kayla started missing curfews
and talking back to me


452
00:34:48.438 --> 00:34:49.815
- from the minute...
- We have to focus on him.


453
00:34:49.898 --> 00:34:51.108
What did they fight about?

454
00:34:51.191 --> 00:34:53.026
I don't know.

455
00:34:56.154 --> 00:34:59.283
Why didn't you call me back
all morning?


456
00:34:59.366 --> 00:35:02.536
My phone got shot in the river.
I had to get a new one.


457
00:35:02.619 --> 00:35:04.121
You cannot just walk out
of here and leave me

458
00:35:04.204 --> 00:35:07.207
to deal with this...
by myself.


459
00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:15.465
She wants to get caught.

460
00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.803
She's upset.
And she's scared shitless


461
00:35:19.887 --> 00:35:21.471
to talk to him.

462
00:35:23.098 --> 00:35:25.017
And to lie.
She's not that kind of kid.


463
00:35:26.852 --> 00:35:29.646
We're asking her to lie for
the rest of her life, Jay.

464
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.985
Okay, this is what we're
- We're putting her


465
00:35:35.068 --> 00:35:36.695
- in a hotel for a couple of days.
- What?


466
00:35:36.778 --> 00:35:38.488
Just to get distance
from this.


467
00:35:38.572 --> 00:35:42.200
And then we're gonna walk her
through the whole story,


468
00:35:42.284 --> 00:35:44.620
and when she's calmer,
then she can talk to him.


469
00:35:44.703 --> 00:35:46.246
Right?
You saw her this morning.


470
00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:48.206
She can't be trusted
to talk to him.


471
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.542
Or anyone right now.

472
00:35:50.626 --> 00:35:52.419
So I'll pack up her things.

473
00:35:52.502 --> 00:35:54.421
You throw whatever you need
into my car.


474
00:35:54.504 --> 00:35:57.841
We got to go. Now.

475
00:36:19.363 --> 00:36:21.198
Rebecca?

476
00:36:21.281 --> 00:36:23.033
What's going on?

477
00:36:23.116 --> 00:36:26.119
Didn't you get my messages? I've
been calling you all morning.


478
00:36:26.203 --> 00:36:27.871
No, I'm so sorry. I didn't.

479
00:36:27.955 --> 00:36:30.290
Is Kayla back now?
I really need to talk to her.


480
00:36:30.374 --> 00:36:32.084
No. She's still out
at the doctor.


481
00:36:32.167 --> 00:36:35.253
Oh, uh, are you okay?

482
00:36:35.337 --> 00:36:37.130
You look really on edge.

483
00:36:37.214 --> 00:36:39.466
- Uh...
- Hey, can I help you?


484
00:36:39.549 --> 00:36:42.177
- This is Britney's dad.
- Uh...


485
00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.471
And this is Kayla's father, Jay.

486
00:36:44.554 --> 00:36:46.556
- Oh. Hey. Uh...
- How you doing?


487
00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:48.517
Sam Ismali.

488
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.686
Oh, you-you took Kayla
to the doctor.


489
00:36:50.769 --> 00:36:53.814
So then-- So she's there now,
by herself?


490
00:36:53.897 --> 00:36:56.733
Running tests.

491
00:36:56.817 --> 00:36:59.277
So we'll call you
when she gets back.


492
00:36:59.361 --> 00:37:00.779
Okay.

493
00:37:09.538 --> 00:37:11.498
What the hell's going on?

494
00:37:11.581 --> 00:37:13.542
Get in the house.

495
00:37:13.625 --> 00:37:15.711
- What is this?
- She's not feeling well.


496
00:37:15.794 --> 00:37:18.797
Why are you guys covering up
for these girls? What'd they do?


497
00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.674
- Look, uh-- You need to leave.
- What'd they do?


498
00:37:20.757 --> 00:37:23.385
I'm sorry, but you need to leave. Yes.
- I need to...


499
00:37:23.468 --> 00:37:25.345
- I got to-- Hey, Kayla.
- Yes.


500
00:37:25.429 --> 00:37:27.014
- You gotta go. Hey.
- Kayla, where's Britney?


501
00:37:27.097 --> 00:37:28.640
- Kayla, where-where is...
- You gotta go.


502
00:37:28.724 --> 00:37:30.642
- Get off me! Shit.
- Dad!


503
00:37:30.726 --> 00:37:33.061
- Jay.
- The hell are you doing?


504
00:37:33.145 --> 00:37:35.105
- You're bleeding.
- Why are you grabbing me like that, man?


505
00:37:35.188 --> 00:37:37.399
- Get out of here! Go!
- I didn't mean to hit him.


506
00:37:37.482 --> 00:37:38.567
He's acting crazy!

507
00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.235
Get in the house.

508
00:37:40.318 --> 00:37:42.404
I just need to know
where my kid is, okay?


509
00:37:45.073 --> 00:37:46.908
I'm going to the police.

510
00:37:50.162 --> 00:37:51.747
Get in the house.

511
00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:00.130
Hang on.

512
00:38:02.632 --> 00:38:04.843
- Ah! Ah...
- Don't move.


513
00:38:06.136 --> 00:38:08.055
Ow! Fuck.

514
00:38:29.868 --> 00:38:32.621
Britney had a bruise
on her face.


515
00:38:34.414 --> 00:38:36.041
I saw it.

516
00:38:36.124 --> 00:38:38.460
It was right here.

517
00:38:38.543 --> 00:38:41.004
It's like
she had been hit.


518
00:38:43.799 --> 00:38:46.635
They were fighting that morning.
He said so himself.


519
00:38:46.718 --> 00:38:48.136
No. No way.

520
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:50.055
- We are not doing that.
- Well, he's at the station


521
00:38:50.138 --> 00:38:51.389
right now giving his own version
of events, so...


522
00:38:51.473 --> 00:38:52.974
- I will not be a party to that.
- Listen to me,


523
00:38:53.058 --> 00:38:55.018
they're gonna arrest her,
they're gonna put her away,


524
00:38:55.102 --> 00:38:56.353
so we need to do something.

525
00:38:56.436 --> 00:38:57.813
I know Sam.
He's not like that.


526
00:38:57.896 --> 00:38:59.481
You used to work there.
Talk to your friend.


527
00:38:59.564 --> 00:39:00.774
- That cop.
- No.


528
00:39:00.857 --> 00:39:02.526
Life for one family's over.

529
00:39:02.609 --> 00:39:04.820
- It doesn't have to be for ours.
- So we frame an innocent man?


530
00:39:04.903 --> 00:39:08.115
Sh-- Look, she had
a bruise on her face.


531
00:39:08.198 --> 00:39:09.950
How many times
did he hit her?


532
00:39:10.033 --> 00:39:11.910
- No. That's not...
- You worked homicide.


533
00:39:11.993 --> 00:39:13.537
People do all kinds
of crazy things.


534
00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.748
They hurt their chil--
They kill their children.


535
00:39:16.832 --> 00:39:18.625
No.

536
00:39:20.669 --> 00:39:24.256
They're coming for her
unless we do something.


537
00:39:43.275 --> 00:39:44.734
Becca?

538
00:39:47.445 --> 00:39:51.616
Damn. They said it was you,
and I said “bullshit.”


539
00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:53.618
Back from the dead.

540
00:39:53.702 --> 00:39:56.329
Or c-corporate law.
Same thing.


541
00:39:56.413 --> 00:39:58.748
How's civilian life
treating you?


542
00:39:58.832 --> 00:39:59.791
Really good.

543
00:39:59.875 --> 00:40:01.626
Yeah. Better than here.

544
00:40:01.710 --> 00:40:03.628
I get free coffee
where I work now.


545
00:40:03.712 --> 00:40:06.339
- Living the dream.
- Mm-hmm.


546
00:40:06.423 --> 00:40:08.091
You want to talk in my office?

547
00:40:09.384 --> 00:40:10.886
No, that's okay.

548
00:40:10.969 --> 00:40:14.723
You know,
it's-it's probably nothing.


549
00:40:14.806 --> 00:40:16.725
But you're here.

550
00:40:16.808 --> 00:40:18.435
So, what's up?

551
00:40:20.270 --> 00:40:21.813
It's Kayla's friend.

552
00:40:21.897 --> 00:40:24.649
She, um, didn't show up
to this big retreat


553
00:40:24.733 --> 00:40:26.067
that the ballet school hosts

554
00:40:26.151 --> 00:40:28.528
every winter
over the long weekend.


555
00:40:28.612 --> 00:40:30.280
So I'm just worried.

556
00:40:30.363 --> 00:40:34.034
So we're talking a teenager
who's been AWOL for what?


557
00:40:34.117 --> 00:40:36.453
Twenty-four hours,
give or take.


558
00:40:36.536 --> 00:40:38.205
Her folks file
a missing persons?


559
00:40:38.288 --> 00:40:40.290
I don't know.

560
00:40:40.373 --> 00:40:43.919
But her father came by the house
earlier today,


561
00:40:44.002 --> 00:40:47.756
acting strange, off.

562
00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:50.175
He scared me.

563
00:40:56.097 --> 00:40:58.058
I think...

564
00:41:01.353 --> 00:41:04.314
...I think that he abuses
his daughter.


565
00:41:51.569 --> 00:41:52.737
Mind if I join?

566
00:41:54.364 --> 00:41:55.657
I don't care.

567
00:42:02.747 --> 00:42:04.332
Want to go for a swim?

568
00:42:06.126 --> 00:42:08.336
That was a stupid
thing to say.


569
00:42:13.174 --> 00:42:15.093
I'm scared.

570
00:42:20.098 --> 00:42:21.725
You know?

571
00:42:29.983 --> 00:42:33.111
It isn't a game,
it's your life.


572
00:42:33.194 --> 00:42:34.654
It's your future.

573
00:42:34.738 --> 00:42:36.906
And it won't always be
like this, but for now,


574
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:38.992
you have to do
everything we say.


575
00:42:39.075 --> 00:42:41.453
It's the only way
we can protect you.


576
00:42:45.665 --> 00:42:47.292
Yeah.

577
00:42:50.962 --> 00:42:52.797
You must be freezing. Here.

578
00:42:54.466 --> 00:42:56.718
Here.

579
00:43:12.776 --> 00:43:15.153
It helps...

580
00:43:17.614 --> 00:43:19.407
It helps take away the pain.

581
00:43:21.326 --> 00:43:23.828
No one likes me.

582
00:43:26.039 --> 00:43:28.792
None of the boys at school
even look at me.


583
00:43:28.875 --> 00:43:31.461
No, that's not true.

584
00:43:31.544 --> 00:43:33.380
You're beautiful.

585
00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:36.091
Not like her.

586
00:43:38.968 --> 00:43:41.763
Is that why you pushed her?

587
00:43:47.977 --> 00:43:52.357
If you do something
really bad...


588
00:43:54.442 --> 00:43:56.111
how do you undo that?

589
00:44:01.658 --> 00:44:03.201
Jay?

590
00:44:03.284 --> 00:44:06.454
Kayla, get in the house.
I need to talk to your dad.


591
00:44:10.959 --> 00:44:13.670
Here you go. Come here.

592
00:44:17.841 --> 00:44:19.384
Kenji's gonna be here soon.

593
00:44:19.467 --> 00:44:21.428
She wants to talk to Kayla.

594
00:44:23.346 --> 00:44:26.182
Tell me about the bruise.

595
00:44:28.810 --> 00:44:33.356
Um, i-it was,
it was on her jaw.


596
00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.817
It was right-right here.

597
00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.945
Did Britney tell you
who hit her?


598
00:44:39.028 --> 00:44:40.572
No.

599
00:44:40.655 --> 00:44:43.450
I realize you may not want
to get anyone in trouble,


600
00:44:43.533 --> 00:44:47.495
but if she did tell you,
I need to know.


601
00:44:47.579 --> 00:44:49.330
She didn't.
I already said that.


602
00:44:49.414 --> 00:44:50.498
Okay.

603
00:44:50.582 --> 00:44:52.542
Got it.

604
00:44:52.625 --> 00:44:54.085
Understood.

605
00:44:55.628 --> 00:44:57.630
When did you and Britney
last talk?


606
00:44:59.048 --> 00:45:02.385
Uh, um, like,

607
00:45:02.469 --> 00:45:06.764
like two-two
or three days ago.


608
00:45:06.848 --> 00:45:09.934
I-I...
I don't really remember.


609
00:45:10.018 --> 00:45:11.811
Britney lives just
a few streets down,


610
00:45:11.895 --> 00:45:14.355
so the girls see each other,
like, almost every day.


611
00:45:14.439 --> 00:45:17.692
So maybe the day
before yesterday?


612
00:45:17.775 --> 00:45:20.361
Yeah. Maybe.

613
00:45:20.445 --> 00:45:22.989
And you didn't go to this
ballet retreat yesterday?


614
00:45:23.072 --> 00:45:25.241
Yeah, um, I, um...

615
00:45:27.368 --> 00:45:29.287
I got sick
at my dad's place,


616
00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:34.876
and then I needed my inhaler,
so we went to my mom's office,


617
00:45:34.959 --> 00:45:38.129
and then we just came back here.

618
00:45:40.298 --> 00:45:44.135
Did Britney ever talk about her
relationship with her father?


619
00:45:58.483 --> 00:46:00.777
Anything helps.

620
00:46:12.413 --> 00:46:17.794
He got mad at her...
a lot, like, all the time.


621
00:46:21.089 --> 00:46:26.344
He's got a really,
really bad temper.


622
00:46:26.427 --> 00:46:28.388
Um...

623
00:46:33.059 --> 00:46:37.146
She told me that he hits her.

624
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:39.190
A lot.

625
00:46:51.327 --> 00:46:53.246
Can I go?

626
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:55.290
She's been sick.

627
00:46:55.373 --> 00:46:57.292
Yeah. I
-I got enough for now.

628
00:46:57.375 --> 00:46:59.836
I'll call if there's
anything else.


629
00:47:04.799 --> 00:47:06.968
Thank you for coming by.

630
00:47:10.805 --> 00:47:12.140
She's so grown up.

631
00:47:12.223 --> 00:47:14.475
Last time I saw Kayla,
she was this tall.


632
00:47:14.559 --> 00:47:15.476
Yeah.

633
00:47:17.061 --> 00:47:20.189
If you need anything
else, give me a call. Anytime.


634
00:47:20.273 --> 00:47:23.901
- Sorry for putting her through that.
- Oh, it's okay.


635
00:47:23.985 --> 00:47:26.487
Dad didn't file a missing
persons. I checked.


636
00:47:26.571 --> 00:47:29.115
What are you gonna do?

637
00:47:29.198 --> 00:47:31.034
Well, I'm gonna reach out
to that piece of shit,


638
00:47:31.117 --> 00:47:32.619
and see what he has
to say for himself.


639
00:47:32.702 --> 00:47:36.414
Speaking of pieces of shit,
how's Jay?


640
00:47:36.497 --> 00:47:38.583
- Oh...
- I thought he would disappear


641
00:47:38.666 --> 00:47:41.002
into his midlife crisis
after the divorce.


642
00:47:41.085 --> 00:47:45.173
Yeah. He's a-actually,
he's changed a lot.


643
00:47:45.256 --> 00:47:47.342
He's really good with Kayla.

644
00:47:47.425 --> 00:47:49.427
No, he's better than me.

645
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:52.847
He's a good dad.

646
00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.850
Still downtown,
kicking it with the vermin?


647
00:47:55.933 --> 00:47:59.520
Well,
some things don't change.


648
00:47:59.604 --> 00:48:02.523
Thank you for coming by.

649
00:48:02.607 --> 00:48:04.942
We should have lunch sometime
or-or even dinner.


650
00:48:05.026 --> 00:48:06.527
Yeah, if you pay.

651
00:48:06.611 --> 00:48:09.822
You're the only one
who can afford it.


652
00:48:09.906 --> 00:48:11.074
- Bye.
- Bye.


653
00:48:39.102 --> 00:48:40.853
Hey.

654
00:48:40.937 --> 00:48:44.273
What you said
about Britney's dad...


655
00:48:44.357 --> 00:48:46.567
Does he really hit her?

656
00:48:55.118 --> 00:48:57.203
Wow.

657
00:48:57.286 --> 00:48:59.747
Guess I learned
from the best.


658
00:49:10.717 --> 00:49:12.677
Will you please stay?

659
00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:16.055
What if he comes back?

660
00:49:16.139 --> 00:49:19.058
I'll talk to your mom.

661
00:49:19.142 --> 00:49:20.768
Okay.

662
00:49:24.731 --> 00:49:27.108
It's really nice
to have you home.


663
00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.161
Yeah, it is.

664
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.643
You know where
the extra blankets are,


665
00:50:02.727 --> 00:50:04.645
in case you get cold.

666
00:50:09.317 --> 00:50:11.694
I'll do it.
I got it.


667
00:50:18.951 --> 00:50:21.078
You didn't change
the locks on the door.


668
00:50:24.582 --> 00:50:26.918
No, I didn't.

669
00:50:45.645 --> 00:50:48.648
How long has she been
cutting herself?


670
00:50:52.068 --> 00:50:56.322
Um, she started a
few months after you left.

671
00:50:56.405 --> 00:51:00.159
I had her talk to somebody,
but she didn't stop, so...


672
00:51:00.243 --> 00:51:02.745
I don't know what to do.

673
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:04.622
I wasn't paying attention.

674
00:51:06.457 --> 00:51:08.042
Hey, hey.

675
00:51:10.461 --> 00:51:12.755
I'm sorry.

676
00:51:16.926 --> 00:51:19.887
I'm so sorry that I wasn't
there all those years.


677
00:51:33.401 --> 00:51:35.945
Jay, there's something wrong with her.

678
00:51:45.454 --> 00:51:49.542
She was such
a happy little girl.


679
00:51:53.421 --> 00:51:55.381
Yeah, she was.

680
00:52:05.474 --> 00:52:07.810
- Good night.
- Night.


681
00:52:29.373 --> 00:52:31.292
Mr. Ismali?

682
00:52:31.375 --> 00:52:34.837
Detectives Tagata, Barnes.

683
00:52:34.921 --> 00:52:36.881
We're with
the prosecutor's office.


684
00:52:36.964 --> 00:52:39.508
You've been out all night.

685
00:52:39.592 --> 00:52:42.678
We've been, uh,
waiting for you.


686
00:52:42.762 --> 00:52:46.182
Yeah, I-I was, I was
looking for my daughter.


687
00:52:46.265 --> 00:52:47.767
Did you find her?

688
00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:50.561
- Might've helped if you filed a report.
- I tried.


689
00:52:50.645 --> 00:52:52.146
They didn't take it seriously.

690
00:52:52.229 --> 00:52:54.315
They said 'cause she's done
this kind of thing before,


691
00:52:54.398 --> 00:52:56.734
- I had to wait 48 hours.
- Your daughter ran away before?


692
00:52:56.817 --> 00:52:58.069
She's not a runaway,

693
00:52:58.152 --> 00:53:00.237
They do this kind of thing.

694
00:53:00.321 --> 00:53:03.449
What're you, uh--
You Indian?


695
00:53:03.532 --> 00:53:05.326
Arab? What?

696
00:53:07.912 --> 00:53:10.247
- Pakistani.
- Oh.


697
00:53:10.331 --> 00:53:13.000
You ever lose your temper
with your kid?


698
00:53:13.084 --> 00:53:14.835
What are you asking exactly?

699
00:53:14.919 --> 00:53:16.212
Have you ever
hit your daughter?


700
00:53:16.295 --> 00:53:18.714
- What?
- It's a simple yes or no answer.


701
00:53:18.798 --> 00:53:21.008
No. No.

702
00:53:21.092 --> 00:53:22.843
I never hit my child.

703
00:53:24.261 --> 00:53:25.930
Who told you this?

704
00:53:26.013 --> 00:53:27.181
- Let's go inside and have a talk.
- No!


705
00:53:27.264 --> 00:53:28.641
This is bullshit.

706
00:53:28.724 --> 00:53:31.268
- Who have you been talking to?
- Hey, hey. I heard you.


707
00:53:31.352 --> 00:53:32.812
I don't think
you fucking did.


708
00:53:32.895 --> 00:53:34.981
- What did you say?
- Let's go inside,


709
00:53:35.064 --> 00:53:36.691
Mr. Ismali.

710
00:53:57.253 --> 00:53:59.547
Dad, it's me.
Come on, wake up.


711
00:54:06.804 --> 00:54:08.723
Wake up.

712
00:54:13.686 --> 00:54:15.855
What're we gonna do today?

713
00:54:15.938 --> 00:54:18.065
- Hey, hey, stop.
- What're we gonna do?


714
00:54:18.149 --> 00:54:19.233
No, Dad!

715
00:54:19.316 --> 00:54:20.776
No!

716
00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:23.112
- What're we gonna do?
- I don't know! I asked you.


717
00:54:23.195 --> 00:54:24.447
- You're gonna hug me.
- Ah! No!


718
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:27.992
- Stop.
- No. No, you stop.


719
00:54:28.075 --> 00:54:29.201
Get her off of me!

720
00:54:29.285 --> 00:54:32.163
Ah! Get her off of me.

721
00:54:32.246 --> 00:54:34.373
- Get her off of me!
- Um, I...


722
00:54:34.457 --> 00:54:36.584
I have to go into the office
for a few hours.


723
00:54:36.667 --> 00:54:38.044
Um, feel free to stay,

724
00:54:38.127 --> 00:54:40.379
but, um, might be nice
to get some fresh air.


725
00:54:40.463 --> 00:54:43.049
No, we'll go to my place.
I have to change anyway.


726
00:54:43.132 --> 00:54:45.092
Say goodbye to your mom.

727
00:54:45.176 --> 00:54:46.385
Go on.

728
00:54:48.137 --> 00:54:50.431
- Bye.
- Bye.


729
00:54:52.516 --> 00:54:54.393
Knock 'em out, knockout.

730
00:54:57.855 --> 00:54:59.815
Don't break anything.

731
00:55:05.696 --> 00:55:08.699
No, no,
you already got me. Ow!


732
00:55:11.535 --> 00:55:14.080
- I thought I hurt you.
- Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.


733
00:55:16.874 --> 00:55:18.584
What're you doing here?

734
00:55:18.667 --> 00:55:20.503
Hi to you too.
Uh, band practice?


735
00:55:20.586 --> 00:55:22.379
You told us to be here
by noon or you'd


736
00:55:22.463 --> 00:55:25.049
fucking fire all of us.

737
00:55:26.884 --> 00:55:28.719
Seriously? You forgot?

738
00:55:28.803 --> 00:55:30.846
I just got caught up

739
00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:34.058
- in stuff and...
- Can we talk for a minute?


740
00:55:34.141 --> 00:55:35.392
In private?

741
00:55:37.436 --> 00:55:39.105
This gig is only, like,
the most important thing to us.


742
00:55:39.188 --> 00:55:40.981
I don't know how
you could've forgot about it.


743
00:55:41.065 --> 00:55:43.859
- I've just been dealing with a lot of shit, okay?
- What shit?


744
00:55:43.943 --> 00:55:46.153
Can we just go back out there?
The band's waiting.


745
00:55:50.449 --> 00:55:52.743
I found this in your car.

746
00:55:52.827 --> 00:55:54.745
Whose is it?

747
00:55:57.206 --> 00:56:00.251
It's Kayla's.

748
00:56:00.334 --> 00:56:02.336
- Can I have it, please?
- Bullshit.


749
00:56:02.419 --> 00:56:04.505
- You know what? I'll just go ask Kayla myself.
- Hey!


750
00:56:04.588 --> 00:56:06.340
Give me the fucking purse
right now.


751
00:56:06.423 --> 00:56:08.509
I'm not gonna say it again.
Give it to me.


752
00:56:11.178 --> 00:56:13.472
Asshole.

753
00:56:30.364 --> 00:56:33.200
Hey. Where's Kayla?

754
00:56:33.284 --> 00:56:36.078
- She took off too.
- What?


755
00:56:36.162 --> 00:56:39.081
What's with your ladies, bro?

756
00:56:39.165 --> 00:56:40.666
Oh...

757
00:56:46.130 --> 00:56:47.214
Becca.

758
00:56:47.298 --> 00:56:48.841
- Hey.
- Kenji.


759
00:56:48.924 --> 00:56:50.467
Hi.

760
00:56:50.551 --> 00:56:54.346
- My partner, Rodney Barnes.
- Hey.


761
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:57.975
- Everything okay?
- We had a talk with Dad.


762
00:56:58.058 --> 00:56:59.810
He was pretty upset,

763
00:56:59.894 --> 00:57:02.354
- said you wouldn't let Kayla speak with him.
- Yeah.


764
00:57:02.438 --> 00:57:04.773
He was acting really crazy,
I told you.


765
00:57:04.857 --> 00:57:08.110
I didn't want him near her.
We know that he has a temper.


766
00:57:08.194 --> 00:57:09.570
According to your kid,
right?


767
00:57:09.653 --> 00:57:10.821
I mean,
none of the other neighbors


768
00:57:10.905 --> 00:57:12.364
really held
the same opinion, but...


769
00:57:12.448 --> 00:57:14.825
Maybe they don't know him
as well as they think.


770
00:57:14.909 --> 00:57:17.286
Did your daughter ever mention

771
00:57:17.369 --> 00:57:19.205
Britney Ismali
losing her cell phone?


772
00:57:19.288 --> 00:57:21.916
No. Did you bring him in
at least?


773
00:57:21.999 --> 00:57:23.500
Kayla gave you plenty
to hold him


774
00:57:23.584 --> 00:57:25.294
for 24 hours,
keep the pressure on.


775
00:57:25.377 --> 00:57:27.963
We think the missing
girl must've lost her cell


776
00:57:28.047 --> 00:57:29.757
'cause the last ding that we got

777
00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.218
was the day
after she disappeared,


778
00:57:32.301 --> 00:57:36.555
and we traced it
to a cell tower downtown.


779
00:57:36.639 --> 00:57:41.227
Your husband lives downtown,
right?


780
00:57:42.686 --> 00:57:44.230
My ex-husband.

781
00:57:44.313 --> 00:57:47.858
Right.
And how does he, uh,


782
00:57:47.942 --> 00:57:50.819
get along with
your daughter's friends?


783
00:57:50.903 --> 00:57:53.697
Like any father would.
What are you implying?


784
00:57:53.781 --> 00:57:55.407
I'm not implying
anything. I'm just,


785
00:57:55.491 --> 00:57:57.743
uh, I'm just wondering.

786
00:57:57.826 --> 00:58:01.664
Girl... Girl was pretty hot.

787
00:58:01.747 --> 00:58:04.166
Did this guy
just get off prison detail?


788
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:06.585
I'd send him back there
if I was you, Kenji.


789
00:58:06.669 --> 00:58:08.420
Teach him some manners.

790
00:58:08.504 --> 00:58:10.589
Just doing the job.

791
00:58:10.673 --> 00:58:12.841
You know how it goes.

792
00:58:12.925 --> 00:58:15.302
Yes, I do.

793
00:58:15.386 --> 00:58:19.014
And I need to do mine, so if
there isn't anything else...


794
00:58:19.098 --> 00:58:20.933
Nothing else.

795
00:58:21.016 --> 00:58:23.018
Thanks, Rebecca.

796
00:58:23.102 --> 00:58:24.853
Happy to help anytime.

797
00:58:46.875 --> 00:58:49.295
Kayla! Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.


798
00:58:49.378 --> 00:58:51.088
This has gone far enough,
all right?


799
00:58:51.171 --> 00:58:53.340
The police are involved now,
do you know that?


800
00:58:53.424 --> 00:58:55.175
So whatever this game is that
you and Britney are playing,


801
00:58:55.259 --> 00:58:56.218
it's over, it's done.

802
00:58:56.302 --> 00:58:57.928
You gotta tell me where she is.

803
00:58:59.722 --> 00:59:01.682
I'm sorry.

804
00:59:01.765 --> 00:59:03.100
I'm sorry, I never...

805
00:59:03.183 --> 00:59:05.102
I never meant for-for it
to go this far.


806
00:59:05.185 --> 00:59:06.812
I never meant for anyone
to g-get hurt.


807
00:59:06.895 --> 00:59:08.439
- What does that mean?
- N-nothing.


808
00:59:08.522 --> 00:59:10.107
What does that mean, Kayla?

809
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:12.318
- Let me go! Let me go!
- Where is my daughter?


810
00:59:12.401 --> 00:59:13.569
My daughter! Jesus!

811
01:01:37.504 --> 01:01:41.258
Kayla! Kayla!

812
01:01:41.341 --> 01:01:43.802
Kayla!

813
01:01:54.897 --> 01:01:56.190
Jay?

814
01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:14.416
Kayla?

815
01:02:16.376 --> 01:02:20.047
Kayla? Honey?

816
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.840
What?

817
01:02:21.924 --> 01:02:23.050
What are you doing?

818
01:02:23.133 --> 01:02:24.259
Kayla?

819
01:02:24.343 --> 01:02:25.928
Kayla,
what were you thinking?


820
01:02:26.011 --> 01:02:27.262
Why did you just leave?

821
01:02:27.346 --> 01:02:29.097
Kenji came by my office.

822
01:02:29.181 --> 01:02:32.100
They tracked down Britney's
- It was downtown.


823
01:02:34.645 --> 01:02:37.898
- Oh, my God. Do you have it?
- No, I left it in my car.


824
01:02:37.981 --> 01:02:40.400
It was turned off.
They won't be able to trace it again.


825
01:02:40.484 --> 01:02:42.027
That doesn't matter.
They know where it was.


826
01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:43.278
They know
you live there.


827
01:02:43.362 --> 01:02:44.821
But so does
half the fucking city.


828
01:02:44.905 --> 01:02:46.198
When'd you talk to them?
You should've called.


829
01:02:46.281 --> 01:02:47.449
- I'm supposed to call you...
- Yeah!


830
01:02:47.533 --> 01:02:48.992
...right after the cops
talked to me?


831
01:02:49.076 --> 01:02:51.662
How's that gonna look?
You have to fucking think, Jay!


832
01:02:51.745 --> 01:02:53.247
I can't be the only one
thinking!


833
01:02:53.330 --> 01:02:55.082
What do you want from me?
I made one mistake!


834
01:02:55.165 --> 01:02:56.875
But we can't make
any mistakes, Jay!


835
01:02:56.959 --> 01:03:00.045
Shut up!

836
01:03:00.128 --> 01:03:03.465
Shut up.
It's my fault, all of it!


837
01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:05.300
It just won't stop.

838
01:03:05.384 --> 01:03:06.593
Kayla, stop it.

839
01:03:06.677 --> 01:03:09.054
- Just stop it.
- I'm a terrible person.


840
01:03:13.392 --> 01:03:16.186
I'm a terrible person.

841
01:03:20.566 --> 01:03:22.150
What I did...

842
01:03:24.027 --> 01:03:27.406
I'm a-- I'm a--
I'm a terrible person.


843
01:03:27.489 --> 01:03:28.740
- I'm a terrible person.
- No.


844
01:03:28.824 --> 01:03:31.952
- No, no, you're not.
- Yes, I am.


845
01:03:32.035 --> 01:03:33.704
Listen.

846
01:03:33.787 --> 01:03:37.374
You are a good person.

847
01:03:37.457 --> 01:03:38.959
I know that.

848
01:03:39.042 --> 01:03:43.213
So that thing that happened,

849
01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:45.048
it was an accident.

850
01:03:45.132 --> 01:03:46.842
You didn't mean it.

851
01:03:46.925 --> 01:03:51.847
And we are never gonna talk
about that thing again.


852
01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:55.309
Ever. Okay?

853
01:03:55.392 --> 01:03:57.686
- Okay?
- Okay.


854
01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:05.444
Shh...

855
01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:28.759
This is it.

856
01:04:49.738 --> 01:04:52.240
Okay, now you've seen it.
You happy?


857
01:04:52.324 --> 01:04:53.909
Give me a minute.

858
01:04:55.952 --> 01:04:58.038
She's a three-time runner.

859
01:04:58.121 --> 01:05:00.499
A year and a half ago,
six months ago.


860
01:05:00.582 --> 01:05:02.292
Kids don't run
without a reason.


861
01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:04.586
Maybe your buddy was right,
huh?


862
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:07.381
Come on, Kenji, I thought
you liked Dad for it.


863
01:05:07.464 --> 01:05:09.216
I do.

864
01:05:09.299 --> 01:05:11.134
Okay, then what are we
doing here?


865
01:05:13.762 --> 01:05:16.973
Let's bring him in
and have another talk.


866
01:06:29.671 --> 01:06:31.882
You familiar
with the Hopewell Bridge?


867
01:06:31.965 --> 01:06:35.302
It's, uh, on Route 275,
just on the way to Gresham.


868
01:06:35.385 --> 01:06:37.220
You can't miss it from the road.

869
01:06:37.304 --> 01:06:40.015
No,
I'm not familiar with it.


870
01:06:40.098 --> 01:06:43.185
So you didn't stop there
that morning with Kayla?


871
01:06:43.268 --> 01:06:45.645
We went straight from
my house to Rebecca's office,


872
01:06:45.729 --> 01:06:47.564
just like I told you,
no stops.


873
01:06:49.775 --> 01:06:51.401
You should be talking
to the father again,


874
01:06:51.485 --> 01:06:53.111
arresting him already.

875
01:06:53.195 --> 01:06:55.489
You're keeping eyes on him,
at least?


876
01:06:55.572 --> 01:06:57.365
Let's get back to this.

877
01:06:57.449 --> 01:06:59.242
This is a waste of time.
I mean, he could flee.


878
01:06:59.326 --> 01:07:02.037
He could be off to Chicago,
or wherever he's from.


879
01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:03.955
Did Kayla and Britney
fight recently?


880
01:07:04.039 --> 01:07:05.916
No.

881
01:07:05.999 --> 01:07:07.375
Never? Wow, really?
They never fought?


882
01:07:07.459 --> 01:07:09.336
- I didn't say that they never fought.
- Okay,


883
01:07:09.419 --> 01:07:10.754
so when was the last time
that they did fight?


884
01:07:10.837 --> 01:07:12.297
You want to give her
a chance to speak,


885
01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.216
or are you just gonna
keep interrupting?


886
01:07:18.512 --> 01:07:21.556
They're best friends.
Of course they fought.


887
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.099
Nothing recent.

888
01:07:23.183 --> 01:07:25.227
We found some e-mails
on Britney's computer


889
01:07:25.310 --> 01:07:27.562
about a boy,
Jeremy Richards.


890
01:07:27.646 --> 01:07:28.730
Do you know him?

891
01:07:28.814 --> 01:07:31.191
No.

892
01:07:31.274 --> 01:07:35.028
He's a kid at school.
So what?


893
01:07:35.111 --> 01:07:36.738
He was your daughter's
boyfriend.


894
01:07:36.822 --> 01:07:40.075
- What?
- A few weeks ago,


895
01:07:40.158 --> 01:07:42.536
she accused Britney
of stealing him.


896
01:07:42.619 --> 01:07:44.996
She wrote kind of
a nasty e-mail too.


897
01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.456
I got it right here.

898
01:07:48.083 --> 01:07:49.835
Yeah.

899
01:07:49.918 --> 01:07:52.128
She threatened
to kill Britney.


900
01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:01.596
Look, we know teenagers
can be melodramatic.


901
01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:04.057
- She obviously didn't mean it.
- Are you serious?


902
01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:06.893
That's ridiculous.

903
01:08:08.979 --> 01:08:11.940
I'm gonna ask you
one more time,


904
01:08:12.023 --> 01:08:14.109
and I need you
to be straight with me.


905
01:08:15.652 --> 01:08:19.239
Was Kayla at,
or in the vicinity of,


906
01:08:19.322 --> 01:08:21.449
the Hopewell Bridge
that morning?


907
01:08:24.703 --> 01:08:26.162
No.

908
01:08:36.172 --> 01:08:39.050
We found this there.

909
01:08:39.134 --> 01:08:41.469
Kayla's inhaler.

910
01:08:48.268 --> 01:08:51.229
The canine unit is
searching the river right now.


911
01:08:51.313 --> 01:08:55.025
It's only a matter of time
until they find her.


912
01:08:56.359 --> 01:08:59.029
Get out.
Get out of my house.


913
01:08:59.112 --> 01:09:01.907
- Come on, Becca.
- I need you to leave right now.


914
01:09:28.975 --> 01:09:30.185
They're gonna come back.

915
01:09:33.146 --> 01:09:35.440
They're gonna arrest her.

916
01:09:35.523 --> 01:09:38.777
They're gonna arrest all of us.

917
01:12:08.676 --> 01:12:11.387
Jay, he's in the house.
The lights went out.


918
01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.393
He must be going upstairs.

919
01:12:17.477 --> 01:12:19.437
<i>Can you see the top floor</i>
<i>from there?</i>


920
01:12:19.521 --> 01:12:22.273
No, I-I mean,
I can't see the back from here.


921
01:12:22.357 --> 01:12:24.234
Hold on.

922
01:12:44.045 --> 01:12:46.798
Jay, he's not turning
any lights on.


923
01:12:46.881 --> 01:12:48.716
I don't know where he is.

924
01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.094
<i>I think we just need</i>
<i>to get out of here.</i>


925
01:12:51.177 --> 01:12:53.221
Okay. Almost done.

926
01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.060
Oh, God,
I think we need to go.


927
01:12:59.144 --> 01:13:01.062
Are you there?

928
01:13:28.882 --> 01:13:31.092
No, no.
You're not going anywhere.


929
01:13:31.176 --> 01:13:33.928
You tell me
where Britney is.


930
01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.976
Where's my daughter?

931
01:13:40.059 --> 01:13:41.936
Jay!

932
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:52.488
- Let go of me!
- Just tell me...


933
01:13:52.572 --> 01:13:53.990
Hey! What are you doing?

934
01:13:54.073 --> 01:13:55.200
What...

935
01:13:55.283 --> 01:13:56.451
Jay!

936
01:13:56.534 --> 01:13:58.494
- Jay!
- Hey, what the hell?


937
01:13:58.578 --> 01:13:59.871
Don't you fucking touch her.

938
01:14:05.543 --> 01:14:06.794
Jay!

939
01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:11.257
- Stop. Stop it!
- Please. Jay.


940
01:14:11.341 --> 01:14:15.094
Jay, stop it.
You're killing him.


941
01:14:16.346 --> 01:14:19.349
Okay.

942
01:14:19.432 --> 01:14:20.558
Stop it!

943
01:14:31.444 --> 01:14:33.112
I know...

944
01:14:34.948 --> 01:14:37.367
I know you've been
protecting her.


945
01:14:39.244 --> 01:14:42.205
I know Kayla's the one...

946
01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.334
I know she did it!

947
01:14:48.461 --> 01:14:49.671
- Jay.
- I know.


948
01:14:49.754 --> 01:14:51.422
Hey, let's go.
Let's go.


949
01:14:51.506 --> 01:14:54.384
Let's go, now. Go!

950
01:15:23.746 --> 01:15:26.082
Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!


951
01:15:26.165 --> 01:15:29.252
Hey!

952
01:15:40.638 --> 01:15:44.100
Rebecca!
Go grab help, Go, go!


953
01:15:44.183 --> 01:15:46.102
Oh, God.

954
01:15:46.185 --> 01:15:47.854
Rebecca.

955
01:15:49.897 --> 01:15:51.858
Help.

956
01:15:53.860 --> 01:15:56.112
What are you doing?

957
01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:10.001
Please...

958
01:16:17.925 --> 01:16:19.844
Please!

959
01:16:19.927 --> 01:16:21.596
Help me.

960
01:16:21.679 --> 01:16:23.806
Please...

961
01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:29.228
Please.

962
01:18:05.825 --> 01:18:07.869
Please don't leave me.

963
01:18:14.333 --> 01:18:17.128
I won't.

964
01:19:40.336 --> 01:19:42.380
Here you go.

965
01:19:53.182 --> 01:19:55.017
Aren't you guys hungry?

966
01:20:56.370 --> 01:20:59.498
Um, I'm gonna be late.

967
01:21:14.972 --> 01:21:16.932
I love you guys.

968
01:22:59.869 --> 01:23:01.829
Is Kayla home?

969
01:23:04.999 --> 01:23:07.460
Mrs. Marston,
is everything okay?


970
01:23:18.179 --> 01:23:20.181
I guess Kayla told you.

971
01:23:21.849 --> 01:23:26.353
Okay, we totally didn't mean
for it to go on this long,


972
01:23:26.437 --> 01:23:30.357
but... I just,

973
01:23:30.441 --> 01:23:32.902
I just wanted to see
my boyfriend.


974
01:23:32.985 --> 01:23:35.780
And Kayla...

975
01:23:37.406 --> 01:23:41.869
...she just, just kind of
went along with it.


976
01:23:47.416 --> 01:23:48.876
Does my dad know?

977
01:23:50.377 --> 01:23:51.504
Am I in trouble?

978
01:24:13.818 --> 01:24:17.279
I'm...
I'm gonna go say hi to her.


979
01:24:17.363 --> 01:24:18.781
Wait.

980
01:24:47.518 --> 01:24:48.811
Go home.

981
01:25:46.410 --> 01:25:47.745
What?

982
01:25:55.753 --> 01:25:58.505
Don't look at me like that.

983
01:25:58.589 --> 01:26:01.634
It was, uh-- B-Britney
planned-planned all of it.


984
01:26:01.717 --> 01:26:03.135
N-not me.

985
01:26:03.218 --> 01:26:04.720
She-she said it would be funny

986
01:26:04.803 --> 01:26:06.722
if-if I pretended to push her.

987
01:26:08.682 --> 01:26:09.892
Kayla, my God.

988
01:26:16.815 --> 01:26:19.109
I was--
I was gonna tell you.


989
01:26:20.444 --> 01:26:21.946
I was.

990
01:26:23.697 --> 01:26:25.491
I swear, I was.

991
01:26:25.574 --> 01:26:29.161
I was, I was gonna tell you,
I... I-I swear.


992
01:26:29.244 --> 01:26:31.497
I swear I was. I
-I...

993
01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.332
But then...

994
01:26:35.167 --> 01:26:37.086
But then, I...

995
01:26:37.169 --> 01:26:38.712
I heard both of you

996
01:26:38.796 --> 01:26:40.547
in the bathroom...

997
01:26:42.257 --> 01:26:44.134
and you were laughing.

998
01:26:48.013 --> 01:26:51.016
It was just like,
you know, before.


999
01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.228
It was like that,
when I was, when I was little.


1000
01:26:54.311 --> 01:26:56.647
It was like that.

1001
01:26:56.730 --> 01:26:59.108
And we were so happy.

1002
01:27:03.278 --> 01:27:07.157
I just, I-I needed
some more time.


1003
01:27:07.241 --> 01:27:10.202
That's all,
I just needed some more time.


1004
01:27:10.285 --> 01:27:13.622
You know?
I just needed time for you,


1005
01:27:13.706 --> 01:27:16.333
for you to choose each other.

1006
01:27:16.417 --> 01:27:18.419
Really, just...

1007
01:27:23.007 --> 01:27:25.384
for you to choose me.

1008
01:27:30.556 --> 01:27:31.724
I'm...

1009
01:27:33.142 --> 01:27:35.394
I'm sorry. Please, no...

1010
01:27:35.477 --> 01:27:37.438
I'm sorry.

1011
01:27:41.984 --> 01:27:44.528
Please, please, no.

1012
01:27:44.611 --> 01:27:46.196
I'm sorry.

1013
01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.615
Please don't leave me.

1014
01:27:48.699 --> 01:27:53.037
I just wanted it to be like
it was before. I'm sorry.


1015
01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:55.706
Please don't leave.

1016
01:27:55.789 --> 01:28:00.085
I'm sorry.
Please don't leave me, Mom.


1017
01:28:00.169 --> 01:28:02.046
Please...

1018
01:28:02.129 --> 01:28:03.630
I can't...

1019
01:28:03.714 --> 01:28:06.300
I love you.

1020
01:28:16.810 --> 01:28:19.229
Please don't leave me.
