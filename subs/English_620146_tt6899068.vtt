Woman: # I remember
how just last December #


2
00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:24.513
# We were here together
in the cold #


3
00:00:24.515 --> 00:00:29.318
# Snow was falling
and I heard you calling me #


4
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.356
# To meet you by the mistletoe #

5
00:00:34.358 --> 00:00:36.692
# And you held
me by the fire #

6
00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:39.461
# With the lights
all on the tree #


7
00:00:39.463 --> 00:00:41.730
# When everything was perfect #

8
00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:44.499
# Just you and me #

9
00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:48.437
# I don't need no presents #

10
00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:54.509
# 'Cause my only wish is
that you're home for Christmas #


11
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:56.878
# Counting down the se... #

12
00:00:58.349 --> 00:01:00.449
Okay, I can't hear my vocals,

13
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:02.501
so can we pump those up
a little bit?


14
00:01:02.502 --> 00:01:04.552
Yeah. No problem. I'll
pump 'em up right now. Uh...


15
00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:05.721
Thank you.

16
00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:09.358
Here we go. Set?

17
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.994
# And you held me
by the fire #


18
00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:14.629
- # Held me by the fire...
# - # With the lights all on the tree #


19
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:16.965
# When everything was perfect #

20
00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:18.900
# Just you and me #

21
00:01:18.902 --> 00:01:21.436
Okay.
I-It's still not up enough.


22
00:01:21.438 --> 00:01:22.938
Can you try
turning the track down?


23
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.806
All right.
Consider it pumped up,


24
00:01:24.808 --> 00:01:27.376
and I will bring the track down
just a little bit for you.


25
00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:28.677
- How's that?
- Hello. Hello.


26
00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.746
Okay. Yeah, let's do it.

27
00:01:30.748 --> 00:01:31.813
Here we go.

28
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:37.652
# I don't need no presents #

29
00:01:37.654 --> 00:01:43.458
# 'Cause my only wish is
that you're home for Christmas #


30
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.661
Okay, sorry.
Can you take the click out?


31
00:01:47.664 --> 00:01:48.997
Taking the click out.

32
00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:50.699
Thank you.

33
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:51.867
Anything else?

34
00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.869
No, that's it. Thanks.

35
00:01:57.408 --> 00:02:01.676
# Favorite carols
and the sound of sleigh bells #


36
00:02:01.678 --> 00:02:06.982
# Running through the city
and the night #


37
00:02:06.984 --> 00:02:11.653
# Fingers frozen,
but your arms were open #


38
00:02:11.655 --> 00:02:16.658
# So you pulled me close
and wrapped me tight #


39
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.494
# And you held
me by the fire #

40
00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:21.863
# With the lights
all on the tree #


41
00:02:21.865 --> 00:02:24.599
# When everything was perfect #

42
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:27.035
# Just you and me #

43
00:02:27.037 --> 00:02:30.906
# I don't need no presents #

44
00:02:30.908 --> 00:02:37.446
# 'Cause my only wish is
that you're home for Christmas #


45
00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:40.916
# Counting down the seconds #

46
00:02:40.918 --> 00:02:44.019
'Cause I need your kisses #

47
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:46.688
# So come home for Christmas #

48
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.459
# To me #

49
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.027
That was really nice, Chance.

50
00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:54.830
Your grandfather'd be really
happy for you over this one.


51
00:03:00.504 --> 00:03:01.736
You good?

52
00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.542
You don't wanna
do one more run-through?


53
00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:13.048
No, I'm good.

54
00:03:16.987 --> 00:03:18.987
We should do
one more for safety.


55
00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.856
I said I'm good.

56
00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:23.892
Merry Christmas.

57
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.030
I'm doing
everything I can to be there.


58
00:03:29.032 --> 00:03:30.532
Aw, man.

59
00:03:30.534 --> 00:03:33.034
Uh, can she talk?
How's she doing?


60
00:03:35.038 --> 00:03:37.539
No, don't worry about it. Just...

61
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.040
Yeah, just let her rest.

62
00:03:39.042 --> 00:03:40.609
Yeah, I'll call later.

63
00:03:41.812 --> 00:03:43.678
Yeah, I love you, too, Dad.

64
00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:47.816
Ah, it's about damn time!

65
00:03:47.818 --> 00:03:50.719
Somebody get me
a sparkling water!


66
00:03:51.722 --> 00:03:53.054
Here you go.

67
00:03:53.056 --> 00:03:54.823
Mom, I swear
that is the last time


68
00:03:54.825 --> 00:03:56.691
I sing that stupid
Christmas song.


69
00:03:56.693 --> 00:03:58.376
What?
Everyone loves that song.


70
00:03:58.377 --> 00:04:00.060
Because my image
needs to be rock 'n' roll!


71
00:04:00.063 --> 00:04:01.997
I'm so sick
of this Christmas thing!


72
00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.165
This Christmas thing
is what got you here.


73
00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:13.074
Hey, what's up? How'd it go?

74
00:04:13.076 --> 00:04:16.044
Uh, cancel my flight home.
And when's my meeting


75
00:04:16.046 --> 00:04:18.046
with Trevor Grossman
about the new album?


76
00:04:18.048 --> 00:04:19.548
Chance,
it's been, like, an hour.


77
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:20.682
You know I'm working on it.

78
00:04:20.684 --> 00:04:22.017
And?

79
00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.953
And I'm trying really hard.

80
00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:27.022
Why are...Why cancel the flights?
What happened?


81
00:04:27.024 --> 00:04:28.757
Well, because we
need to be here


82
00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.859
for when Roger
sets up the meeting.


83
00:04:30.861 --> 00:04:32.827
We need to be here? Chance...

84
00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:34.963
with Christmas happening,

85
00:04:34.965 --> 00:04:36.798
I don't think anyone's
gonna be available


86
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.568
till, like, the 27th, and my mom
is really having a hard...


87
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.770
Brian, get it done.

88
00:04:43.106 --> 00:04:45.840
Now get out. Need some quiet.

89
00:04:47.945 --> 00:04:49.778
Chance, please.

90
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.413
You don't understand.

91
00:04:51.414 --> 00:04:53.047
All I need is a few days
to see my mom.


92
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.650
Oh, you can leave
whenever you want.


93
00:04:55.652 --> 00:04:58.987
Thank you. I can't tell you
how much that means to me.


94
00:04:58.989 --> 00:05:01.723
It's just gonna be really hard
to get a new assistant,


95
00:05:01.725 --> 00:05:06.127
especially this time of year,
but if you really need to...


96
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.763
Nah, just...

97
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:11.866
I'll stay.

98
00:05:11.868 --> 00:05:12.934
Good.

99
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:14.936
Great.

100
00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:20.208
Brian, what's up, man?

101
00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:21.642
We gotta talk about
that scheduling for Chance...


102
00:05:21.643 --> 00:05:23.076
Cory, I can't talk
right now. Sorry.


103
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.146
...scheduling. Come on.

104
00:05:25.148 --> 00:05:28.149
Jason! How's my favorite
male pop star?


105
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:31.286
Coo...We gotta talk
about the Europe tour, baby!


106
00:05:32.222 --> 00:05:34.055
Hey, I'm family.

107
00:05:38.862 --> 00:05:41.229
- Hell of a day.
- Hey, baby.


108
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:42.297
Mmm.

109
00:05:43.967 --> 00:05:45.300
Hey, Nate,

110
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:46.634
why don't you
hang out in the car?


111
00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:47.869
I'll let you know
when I need you.


112
00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:48.937
Copy that.

113
00:05:51.942 --> 00:05:54.175
Nate, I really
need to speak to Ja...


114
00:05:57.047 --> 00:05:59.314
Great. Great.

115
00:06:00.817 --> 00:06:02.968
- I hate that song.
- Ahh.


116
00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.120
- I keep telling Cory not to...
- I know. Mine, too.


117
00:06:05.122 --> 00:06:07.689
They had me do the bridge,
like, 40 times,


118
00:06:07.691 --> 00:06:09.190
like I'm some beginner,
so I fired my manager


119
00:06:09.192 --> 00:06:10.692
right there in front of them.

120
00:06:10.694 --> 00:06:12.794
- You fired Tom?
- Yeah.


121
00:06:12.796 --> 00:06:14.929
I had to let 'em know
who they're dealing with.


122
00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:16.665
You put your guard down
for one second,


123
00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.033
and people start thinking
they're in control.


124
00:06:18.035 --> 00:06:20.802
- What did Tom do?
- He set up the session.


125
00:06:20.804 --> 00:06:23.004
Haven't you been
with him for, like, ever?


126
00:06:23.006 --> 00:06:24.873
Let's not talk about that.

127
00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:26.842
Hey, no more work,

128
00:06:26.843 --> 00:06:28.810
'cause I have
a little surprise for you.


129
00:06:28.812 --> 00:06:30.812
I love surprises.

130
00:06:30.814 --> 00:06:33.248
Why don't we spend
New Year's Eve in Paris?


131
00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.916
Are you serious?

132
00:06:34.918 --> 00:06:36.251
Serious as a heart attack.

133
00:06:36.253 --> 00:06:38.286
It'll be the most romantic week.

134
00:06:38.288 --> 00:06:41.156
Oh, my God, baby!
I love you!


135
00:06:41.158 --> 00:06:45.026
Of course. I'm gonna get you
a front-row ticket to the show.


136
00:06:45.028 --> 00:06:47.128
The show? What show?

137
00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:49.998
I'm playing
the stadium in Paris.


138
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.232
Can you believe that?

139
00:06:51.234 --> 00:06:53.835
And you can be
my little groupie.


140
00:06:53.837 --> 00:06:55.904
Your groupie?

141
00:06:55.906 --> 00:06:57.739
Yeah, my sexy groupie.

142
00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:01.242
Okay, Jason, not now.
My mom's in the other room.


143
00:07:01.244 --> 00:07:03.712
Aw, come on.

144
00:07:03.714 --> 00:07:06.915
I've been working
with these hacks all day long.


145
00:07:06.917 --> 00:07:08.850
You texted me to stop by.

146
00:07:08.852 --> 00:07:12.721
I know, but I actually
just want to be alone, so...


147
00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:14.114
You don't wanna spend time

148
00:07:14.115 --> 00:07:15.506
with your boyfriend
on Christmas Eve?


149
00:07:15.507 --> 00:07:16.898
Oh, screw Christmas!

150
00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:18.290
What is your problem?
I stopped by to be with you.


151
00:07:18.295 --> 00:07:19.994
Now you're trying
to throw me out?


152
00:07:19.996 --> 00:07:22.063
I'm not throwing you out.
I'm just tired,


153
00:07:22.065 --> 00:07:23.932
and we can see
each other tomorrow.


154
00:07:23.934 --> 00:07:25.867
Come on.
God, don't be like this!


155
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:27.168
I'm not being like anything!

156
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:28.970
Why can't anyone
just listen to me?


157
00:07:28.972 --> 00:07:30.238
Because you're acting crazy.

158
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.774
Oh, I'm crazy now?

159
00:07:32.776 --> 00:07:34.409
Just get out.

160
00:07:36.146 --> 00:07:38.880
Fine. Eh, have it your way.

161
00:07:39.883 --> 00:07:41.382
Uh, Jason, wait!

162
00:07:53.296 --> 00:07:55.897
Give her a minute, chief.
She's in a mood.


163
00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:57.132
Thanks for the heads-up.

164
00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:58.366
Hey, you...you wrap up
that European deal?


165
00:07:58.368 --> 00:08:00.034
Yeah, I told you. Tonight.

166
00:08:01.037 --> 00:08:02.971
Your car's ready outside, sir.

167
00:08:08.311 --> 00:08:09.944
You got this.

168
00:08:12.883 --> 00:08:13.915
Cory!

169
00:08:13.917 --> 00:08:16.885
- Hi.
- Hi.


170
00:08:18.088 --> 00:08:20.822
Now, why is Brian having
to get me all my meetings


171
00:08:20.824 --> 00:08:23.024
when I have one
of the best agents in town?


172
00:08:23.026 --> 00:08:25.594
Merry Christmas to you, too.

173
00:08:25.595 --> 00:08:28.163
I asked you to get me
that meeting last week.


174
00:08:28.165 --> 00:08:31.232
And I told you last week that I would
get you in with him when he's available.


175
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:34.903
Patience.

176
00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:36.938
So, anyway,
how'd the recording go today?


177
00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.174
I can't believe
I let them talk me into it.


178
00:08:39.176 --> 00:08:43.077
But it is a good paycheck,
so I'll take it.


179
00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:45.113
Actually, I wanted
to talk to you about that.


180
00:08:45.115 --> 00:08:46.815
About what?

181
00:08:46.817 --> 00:08:48.316
When I picked your mom up
at the airport,


182
00:08:48.318 --> 00:08:50.218
we were talking,
and we were thinking maybe


183
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.253
we could donate the proceeds
from this to charity.


184
00:08:52.255 --> 00:08:54.088
What are you talking about?

185
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.324
My cut, too.
You know, we give it all away.


186
00:08:56.326 --> 00:09:00.061
Look, this paycheck is peanuts
compared to your last release.


187
00:09:00.063 --> 00:09:02.147
We could easily give it

188
00:09:02.148 --> 00:09:04.232
to the less fortunate
for Christmas.


189
00:09:05.368 --> 00:09:07.836
Hmm.

190
00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:12.040
Who exactly is this "we"
we're talking about?


191
00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:14.309
- What?
- This is my money.


192
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:18.012
How dare you and my mother talk
about my money behind my back?


193
00:09:18.014 --> 00:09:19.914
I-I thought
you would love the idea,


194
00:09:19.916 --> 00:09:21.249
a-and your mom said
that, for Christmas...


195
00:09:21.251 --> 00:09:24.085
Oh, for Christmas?
I hate Christmas.


196
00:09:24.087 --> 00:09:26.254
It's a stupid,
unnecessary holiday


197
00:09:26.256 --> 00:09:28.122
where I'm expected
to buy things for people


198
00:09:28.124 --> 00:09:29.424
and pretend I care about them.

199
00:09:29.426 --> 00:09:31.259
I'm boycotting this year.

200
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:34.062
Wow. Wow.

201
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.466
You know what, Chance?

202
00:09:40.003 --> 00:09:42.403
Take a long, hard look
in that mirror.


203
00:09:42.405 --> 00:09:44.339
You might be surprised
what you see.


204
00:09:50.213 --> 00:09:51.379
Oh.

205
00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:55.350
My car's here.

206
00:09:59.055 --> 00:10:00.889
Looks like
we're done for the day.


207
00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:02.591
They got everything they needed.

208
00:10:02.592 --> 00:10:04.292
Do you wanna grab dinner
on the way to the airport?


209
00:10:04.294 --> 00:10:06.160
- You can. I'm staying.
- What?


210
00:10:06.162 --> 00:10:09.097
But feel free to take
Santa Claus over here with you.


211
00:10:09.099 --> 00:10:10.765
- What?
- Okay, look, Mom,


212
00:10:10.766 --> 00:10:12.432
I know you might
not understand this concept,


213
00:10:12.435 --> 00:10:15.436
but I have a business to run,
and I am the business,


214
00:10:15.438 --> 00:10:17.939
so I can't just be running off
for no good reason.


215
00:10:17.941 --> 00:10:20.174
No good reason?
It's Christmas.


216
00:10:20.176 --> 00:10:21.726
Everyone's waiting for you.

217
00:10:21.727 --> 00:10:23.277
We have a whole party
planned for us.


218
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.213
Well, then,
tell them I said hello.


219
00:10:25.215 --> 00:10:26.915
My car's here.

220
00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:30.051
Cory, get me that meeting!

221
00:10:31.054 --> 00:10:32.420
Don't do this.

222
00:10:32.422 --> 00:10:34.322
Your father's
gonna be devastated.


223
00:10:43.133 --> 00:10:44.332
She's coming. She's coming.

224
00:10:44.334 --> 00:10:46.134
Get ready. Get ready.

225
00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:48.603
Watch your step.

226
00:10:50.106 --> 00:10:52.373
Chance! Hey, Chance!
Please sign this!


227
00:10:52.375 --> 00:10:54.042
- Hold on.
- Chance, please!


228
00:10:54.044 --> 00:10:55.610
Take a moment.
Say hi to my daughter!


229
00:10:57.347 --> 00:11:00.181
Say hi to my daughter?
She loves you!


230
00:11:00.183 --> 00:11:01.482
Bodyguard: Back up. Sir!

231
00:11:05.088 --> 00:11:06.521
Excuse me.

232
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:08.556
It's okay, sweetie.

233
00:11:08.558 --> 00:11:10.491
It's okay.

234
00:11:10.493 --> 00:11:12.994
I tell you what.
You wanna go get some ice cream?


235
00:11:12.996 --> 00:11:13.995
Yeah?

236
00:11:13.997 --> 00:11:15.263
Want some ice cream?

237
00:11:15.265 --> 00:11:16.431
Okay.

238
00:11:16.433 --> 00:11:17.632
Let's go.

239
00:11:24.341 --> 00:11:25.974
Survive the crowd okay?

240
00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:28.576
Yeah, barely.

241
00:11:28.578 --> 00:11:31.546
Phew.

242
00:11:31.548 --> 00:11:33.548
Merry Christmas, Ms. Love.

243
00:11:34.484 --> 00:11:36.250
Man, they really love you.

244
00:11:36.252 --> 00:11:38.386
Please.

245
00:11:38.388 --> 00:11:41.089
Hey, one thing.
If you mistreat your fans,


246
00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:42.991
you just might
not have any one day.


247
00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:46.260
No one's asking
for your advice, Brian.


248
00:11:46.262 --> 00:11:49.030
Fine. Here. You know what?

249
00:11:49.032 --> 00:11:51.399
I'm gonna catch up
on your taxes.


250
00:11:51.401 --> 00:11:53.401
Disclaimer, you might
have to hire a CPA,


251
00:11:53.403 --> 00:11:56.237
'cause we're two years
behind already.


252
00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:58.289
I can handle my own business.

253
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.340
Chance, you really
can't keep pushing this off.


254
00:12:00.343 --> 00:12:02.043
They're really
gonna come after you.


255
00:12:02.045 --> 00:12:04.412
Bobby, what's the holdup?
Take me home already.


256
00:12:04.414 --> 00:12:06.280
We're not waiting
for your mom?


257
00:12:06.282 --> 00:12:08.049
No. Just drive.

258
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:09.550
How's she gonna get
to the airport?


259
00:12:09.552 --> 00:12:11.486
We're not going
to the airport, Bobby.


260
00:12:11.488 --> 00:12:14.489
Are your ears clogged?
Drive home now!


261
00:12:14.491 --> 00:12:16.290
You're the boss.

262
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.227
It's gonna take
just a couple of minutes


263
00:12:19.229 --> 00:12:21.195
for the fans to clear us a path.

264
00:12:21.197 --> 00:12:22.463
Fine.

265
00:12:22.465 --> 00:12:24.465
I hate this time of year.

266
00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:26.300
No, you don't.
You're just hungry.


267
00:12:26.302 --> 00:12:28.603
No, you're hangry again.

268
00:12:28.605 --> 00:12:30.438
Shut up.

269
00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.040
My place is
just down the street


270
00:12:32.042 --> 00:12:34.159
if you want
to grab something.


271
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.277
Are you serious? No.

272
00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:38.212
Fine. I was...
was just offering.


273
00:12:39.482 --> 00:12:44.252
Your dad had this cute
little guy sent to the office.


274
00:12:44.254 --> 00:12:46.454
Look at him.

275
00:12:47.557 --> 00:12:50.091
I grabbed him off the desk
on the way out.


276
00:12:50.093 --> 00:12:51.192
Here you go.

277
00:12:52.228 --> 00:12:53.594
Thank you.

278
00:12:55.198 --> 00:12:56.397
Little guitar.

279
00:12:59.469 --> 00:13:01.335
Sir...

280
00:13:01.337 --> 00:13:02.670
get rid of this.

281
00:13:05.308 --> 00:13:07.208
That wasn't very nice,
Ms. Love.


282
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.478
You know, he probably
had that specially made.


283
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.246
I'm not a little girl anymore.

284
00:13:12.248 --> 00:13:14.348
So? He's still your dad.

285
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:17.151
He sent that to you,
because he loves you.


286
00:13:17.153 --> 00:13:19.487
He's gonna notice when he comes
to visit and it's not around.


287
00:13:19.489 --> 00:13:22.490
I pay you to drive,
not give me advice, okay?


288
00:13:23.626 --> 00:13:26.160
So, uh, hey,

289
00:13:26.162 --> 00:13:28.362
did your mom mention the thing?

290
00:13:28.364 --> 00:13:30.298
- You knew about that?
- Yeah.


291
00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.499
I think it's a great idea,

292
00:13:31.501 --> 00:13:33.634
giving presents
to, like, the kids


293
00:13:33.636 --> 00:13:35.303
at orphanages and hospitals,
that's amazing.


294
00:13:35.305 --> 00:13:36.504
You know how happy
they're gonna be?


295
00:13:36.506 --> 00:13:38.239
So happy.

296
00:13:38.241 --> 00:13:40.458
See?

297
00:13:40.459 --> 00:13:42.676
Do you wanna give away
all of your money to charity?


298
00:13:42.679 --> 00:13:44.112
Actually, yeah.

299
00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:45.580
N-Not all of it,
but some of it.


300
00:13:45.582 --> 00:13:48.133
Good for you.

301
00:13:48.134 --> 00:13:50.685
Me? I gotta look out
for number one.


302
00:13:50.687 --> 00:13:53.454
My music makes people happy.

303
00:13:53.456 --> 00:13:56.457
That's how I give back,
and that's enough for me.


304
00:13:56.459 --> 00:13:59.260
Ah, that's not
the Chance I grew up with.


305
00:13:59.262 --> 00:14:00.528
You don't even sound like you.

306
00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.130
Deal with it.

307
00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:04.499
Hey, if it's about money,
I can make sure


308
00:14:04.501 --> 00:14:06.601
there's tax write-offs,
charity donations.


309
00:14:06.603 --> 00:14:08.369
I'll make sure
you save money on it.


310
00:14:08.371 --> 00:14:09.704
Brian, just shut
your trap, okay?


311
00:14:12.275 --> 00:14:14.242
Okay.
I was just trying to help.


312
00:14:14.244 --> 00:14:15.643
Yeah, I got it.

313
00:14:16.713 --> 00:14:18.513
Okay, they're clearing up.

314
00:14:18.515 --> 00:14:20.148
We can go now.

315
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:21.582
All right, I'm gonna take a nap.

316
00:14:21.584 --> 00:14:23.284
Wake me up when we get there.

317
00:14:23.286 --> 00:14:24.619
You got it, Ms. Love.

318
00:14:35.632 --> 00:14:37.632
Seriously?

319
00:14:37.634 --> 00:14:38.766
All the lights on?

320
00:14:38.768 --> 00:14:40.568
What, am I made of money?

321
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:43.704
I'm so firing
those cleaning ladies.


322
00:15:17.674 --> 00:15:22.210
Really? 500 channels,
and there's actually nothing on?


323
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.547
Did Brian forget to pay my bill?

324
00:15:39.495 --> 00:15:42.797
Oh, no.

325
00:15:42.799 --> 00:15:44.732
Oh, wow! It's really you.

326
00:15:44.734 --> 00:15:46.434
I
-I'm a little starstruck.

327
00:15:46.436 --> 00:15:48.636
Um, I-I got you
your kale smoothie right here.


328
00:15:48.638 --> 00:15:51.339
I put in, um,
some extra vitamin shots,


329
00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:53.374
an immunity boost,
and some extra protein powder,


330
00:15:53.376 --> 00:15:54.609
- because, yeah...
- Okay.


331
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:55.843
I gotta tell you,
I'm a huge fan.


332
00:15:55.845 --> 00:15:57.378
- Yeah.
- Thank you.


333
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.313
No, hey, do you think
I could actually get


334
00:15:59.315 --> 00:16:01.449
your...your signature on this?
You can make it out to Toby?


335
00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:03.251
Oh. Yeah, no,
my hand's tired.


336
00:16:03.253 --> 00:16:04.786
- Your hand is...
- I'm sorry, yeah.


337
00:16:04.787 --> 00:16:06.320
No. No, don't close it.

338
00:16:06.322 --> 00:16:07.688
Please don't.
No, no, don't close it.


339
00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:08.856
Mm-mmm.

340
00:16:10.493 --> 00:16:11.659
Mm-mmm.

341
00:16:13.663 --> 00:16:14.829
Merry Christmas!

342
00:16:36.319 --> 00:16:38.386
There we go.

343
00:16:39.689 --> 00:16:40.821
Much better.

344
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.912
Aw, man

345
00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:25.960
Chance!

346
00:18:26.996 --> 00:18:28.729
Chance?

347
00:18:28.731 --> 00:18:30.931
Stay away from me.

348
00:18:30.933 --> 00:18:32.533
- Chance!
- Who are you?!


349
00:18:32.535 --> 00:18:33.934
What do you want?!

350
00:18:33.936 --> 00:18:36.537
Don't you recognize
your own grandfather?


351
00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.075
Grandpa Jack?

352
00:18:41.076 --> 00:18:44.611
You've started to go down
a road that leads into the dark.


353
00:18:44.614 --> 00:18:47.815
What is going on?

354
00:18:47.817 --> 00:18:51.018
How are you here?
Wh-Why are you here?


355
00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.453
Look at you.

356
00:18:52.455 --> 00:18:54.422
Look what you've become!

357
00:18:54.424 --> 00:18:57.858
It was
that delivery guy, Toby,


358
00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.795
with the kale sm...He spiked
my smoothie. That's it.


359
00:19:00.797 --> 00:19:02.563
No, no, no, no!

360
00:19:02.565 --> 00:19:03.998
This is not a trick.

361
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.934
Your time has come.

362
00:19:06.936 --> 00:19:08.569
I'm an old man.
I need a seat.


363
00:19:08.571 --> 00:19:10.571
What?

364
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:14.942
It never gets easier.

365
00:19:14.944 --> 00:19:16.977
I have a gift for you.

366
00:19:16.979 --> 00:19:18.045
I'm getting a gift?

367
00:19:18.047 --> 00:19:20.581
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.


368
00:19:20.583 --> 00:19:22.650
Now I know I'm crazy.
I've lost it.


369
00:19:22.652 --> 00:19:25.820
I'm sitting here, talking to
my dead rock-star grandfather.


370
00:19:25.822 --> 00:19:27.755
All right, all right.
Let's cut to the chase.


371
00:19:27.757 --> 00:19:29.857
Let's stop with
the chitter-chatter, all right?


372
00:19:29.859 --> 00:19:31.492
Let's get to it.

373
00:19:31.494 --> 00:19:34.662
Okay.
So, ghost of Grandpa Jack,


374
00:19:34.664 --> 00:19:36.664
why don't you
just give me the gift,


375
00:19:36.666 --> 00:19:37.998
and we can wrap this up,

376
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.733
'cause it's freaking me out
a little bit.


377
00:19:39.735 --> 00:19:41.936
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You see,


378
00:19:41.938 --> 00:19:45.639
my actions in life
have had consequences


379
00:19:45.641 --> 00:19:48.709
that have lasted
throughout my living years.


380
00:19:48.711 --> 00:19:53.647
These contracts
became my life, my family...


381
00:19:53.649 --> 00:19:56.016
and to them,

382
00:19:56.018 --> 00:20:00.788
my soul is bound forever.

383
00:20:02.959 --> 00:20:07.895
I must carry these
throughout all time,


384
00:20:07.897 --> 00:20:09.730
retribution...

385
00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:13.701
for a wasted life.

386
00:20:13.702 --> 00:20:15.902
- Do you need my help?
- No, I don't need your help.


387
00:20:15.905 --> 00:20:18.939
That ship has...
long gone. Nah.


388
00:20:18.941 --> 00:20:22.643
But living for one's self,

389
00:20:22.645 --> 00:20:26.046
only for one's self,
has a price.


390
00:20:29.619 --> 00:20:31.552
I came here
to give you this gift,


391
00:20:31.554 --> 00:20:34.522
the gift of another chance.

392
00:20:34.524 --> 00:20:35.923
Another chance?

393
00:20:35.925 --> 00:20:37.558
That's right.

394
00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:43.063
Tonight, you'll
be visited by three spirits,


395
00:20:43.065 --> 00:20:47.835
one of which will reveal
themselves within the next hour.


396
00:20:47.837 --> 00:20:50.804
You're sending me
three ghosts?!


397
00:20:50.806 --> 00:20:52.957
That's right, my dear,

398
00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:55.109
my gift
to my lovely granddaughter.


399
00:20:55.111 --> 00:20:57.811
Some gift.

400
00:20:57.813 --> 00:21:02.082
Chance, y-you gotta
change your ways.


401
00:21:02.084 --> 00:21:04.718
If you don't change your ways,
you're gonna end up like me!


402
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.786
A rock star?

403
00:21:05.788 --> 00:21:07.555
No, doomed!

404
00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:10.208
Doomed, I tell thee!

405
00:21:10.209 --> 00:21:12.860
I lived my entire life
for fame, money, fortune,


406
00:21:12.862 --> 00:21:15.629
and look where it brought me!
Here!


407
00:21:15.631 --> 00:21:18.999
When my life should have
been about sincerity...


408
00:21:20.136 --> 00:21:21.869
humility...

409
00:21:22.939 --> 00:21:24.838
kindness, and mercy.

410
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.140
Do you hear what I'm saying?

411
00:21:29.612 --> 00:21:30.911
Think I just broke something.

412
00:21:32.048 --> 00:21:36.850
But it might not be
too late for you.


413
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.821
Another chance.

414
00:21:40.823 --> 00:21:42.222
Oh, man.

415
00:21:49.665 --> 00:21:51.198
Grandpa Jack...

416
00:21:52.134 --> 00:21:53.767
out.

417
00:22:06.048 --> 00:22:10.250
Yeah. There was definitely
something in that smoothie.


418
00:22:11.754 --> 00:22:13.087
I gotta get out of here.

419
00:22:16.158 --> 00:22:18.058
Christmas...

420
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.128
lies told to force kids
to sit on the lap


421
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:24.098
of a jiggle-bellied pimp
in a red velvet suit


422
00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.101
to capture that Kodak moment,

423
00:22:27.103 --> 00:22:30.004
hoping he's real,
hoping for rewards,


424
00:22:30.006 --> 00:22:31.171
hoping he don't attack,

425
00:22:31.173 --> 00:22:33.641
but no time
for thought on that.


426
00:22:33.643 --> 00:22:37.645
Hang ten on the Net to catch
that cyberwave of capitalism,


427
00:22:37.647 --> 00:22:39.880
ripping, running,
racing through stores


428
00:22:39.882 --> 00:22:41.815
to buy more things
we can't afford,


429
00:22:41.817 --> 00:22:44.718
then wrap them
in festive gaudy paper.


430
00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.787
Oh, we destroy that later.

431
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:49.890
That is how we celebrate,

432
00:22:49.892 --> 00:22:51.992
like my inebriated Uncle Jimmy,

433
00:22:51.994 --> 00:22:54.762
who, once again,
this holiday season,


434
00:22:54.764 --> 00:22:59.967
drowns his failed hopes
and dreams in a bottle.


435
00:22:59.969 --> 00:23:01.735
What a treat,

436
00:23:01.737 --> 00:23:03.037
overeat processed meat.

437
00:23:03.039 --> 00:23:06.206
St. Nick is
a jive turkey from Turkey.


438
00:23:06.208 --> 00:23:09.209
No grace, tight space,
tight waist,


439
00:23:09.211 --> 00:23:11.879
slips down inside your place,

440
00:23:11.881 --> 00:23:13.714
eats your cookies and milk,

441
00:23:13.716 --> 00:23:17.317
leaves packages
under a murdered tree.


442
00:23:18.688 --> 00:23:20.287
Rich cat with a pimpish red hat.

443
00:23:20.289 --> 00:23:21.889
Did you know that?

444
00:23:22.892 --> 00:23:24.792
Celebrate.

445
00:23:25.695 --> 00:23:29.963
Joy, excitement, family.

446
00:23:29.965 --> 00:23:32.299
Focused on an overweight,
out-of-date clown


447
00:23:32.301 --> 00:23:35.169
so unrelated,
I can't concentrate.


448
00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.777
Why can't we remember...

449
00:23:43.779 --> 00:23:45.813
Hey, good evening.
Happy Holidays.


450
00:23:45.815 --> 00:23:47.748
Would you like to see a menu?

451
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.433
Yeah.

452
00:23:49.434 --> 00:23:51.117
...playing their hand
to get the common man


453
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.252
to follow their plan.

454
00:23:52.254 --> 00:23:54.221
Hey. Uh, merry Christmas.

455
00:23:54.223 --> 00:23:55.723
What can I get for you?

456
00:23:55.725 --> 00:23:56.890
Cranberry vodka.

457
00:23:56.892 --> 00:23:59.026
All right.

458
00:23:59.028 --> 00:24:02.129
...a brand-new rendition
of a pagan tradition


459
00:24:02.131 --> 00:24:05.733
designed to keep
the people in check.


460
00:24:05.735 --> 00:24:07.334
And so we celebrate...

461
00:24:07.336 --> 00:24:10.037
There you go,
little Christmas cheer.


462
00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:12.873
Poet: # Love and happiness #

463
00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:14.875
Joy, excitement...

464
00:24:14.877 --> 00:24:18.112
- # All is calm #
- family...


465
00:24:19.749 --> 00:24:23.183
# All is bright #

466
00:24:23.185 --> 00:24:31.892
# Sleep in heavenly peace #

467
00:24:31.894 --> 00:24:40.768
# Sleep in heavenly peace #

468
00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.170
Mmm, "Silent Night."

469
00:24:44.073 --> 00:24:45.906
Hello, doll.

470
00:24:45.908 --> 00:24:49.042
Ah, that is
just one fine piece of music.


471
00:24:49.044 --> 00:24:50.778
Mm, mm, it's a classic.

472
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.313
My opinion,
Ol' Blue Eyes did it best.


473
00:24:53.315 --> 00:24:56.283
I didn't think your generation
went in for that kind of thing.


474
00:24:56.285 --> 00:24:59.453
It was my grandfather's
secret favorite song, so...


475
00:25:01.257 --> 00:25:04.358
Now, look,
I don't mean to be nosy,


476
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:07.227
but, uh, aren't you Chance Love?

477
00:25:07.229 --> 00:25:08.328
Guilty.

478
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.798
Oh, well, well, well, Chance.

479
00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.132
It's an absolute pleasure.

480
00:25:12.134 --> 00:25:13.333
I'm Gus.

481
00:25:13.335 --> 00:25:14.902
It was nice to meet you, Gus.

482
00:25:14.904 --> 00:25:16.837
Mm, well, doll,
let me tell you this.


483
00:25:16.839 --> 00:25:18.939
With legs like that
and a suit like this,


484
00:25:18.941 --> 00:25:21.809
we could dance the night away.

485
00:25:21.811 --> 00:25:24.311
Okay, thanks, but I'll pass.

486
00:25:24.313 --> 00:25:26.146
Ah. Well, that's too bad.

487
00:25:29.819 --> 00:25:32.003
What's a nice girl like you

488
00:25:32.004 --> 00:25:34.188
doing in a dive like this
on Christmas Eve, huh?


489
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.157
Shouldn't you be at some big
Hollywood shindig in the Hills?


490
00:25:37.159 --> 00:25:39.326
Can you please
stop talking to me?


491
00:25:39.328 --> 00:25:43.030
Oh, I'm sorry.
I meant no offense.


492
00:25:50.439 --> 00:25:51.872
Well, Merry Christmas.

493
00:25:51.874 --> 00:25:53.373
You have yourself
a nice evening.


494
00:25:56.378 --> 00:25:59.213
Uh, one more thing, doll face.

495
00:26:05.254 --> 00:26:06.453
What?

496
00:26:12.061 --> 00:26:14.127
What's happening?
Where am I?


497
00:26:14.129 --> 00:26:17.164
No, no, no, no.
Have a drink. Take the edge off.


498
00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:20.067
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is...This is...


499
00:26:20.069 --> 00:26:21.869
This is your childhood home.

500
00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:23.937
Mom? Dad?

501
00:26:23.939 --> 00:26:25.456
Sweetie, sweetie,
no, no, no, no touchie.


502
00:26:25.457 --> 00:26:26.974
No, no, can't hear you.
Can't see you.


503
00:26:26.976 --> 00:26:28.976
It's just us, okay?

504
00:26:28.977 --> 00:26:30.977
Yeah, the tree
looks really good this year.


505
00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:32.145
You did a great job.

506
00:26:32.147 --> 00:26:33.180
Mama bear, Papa bear.

507
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.183
Gus is the name.

508
00:26:36.185 --> 00:26:38.151
Ghost of Christmas Past
is my job,


509
00:26:38.153 --> 00:26:40.120
though I've never been
too keen about that title.


510
00:26:40.122 --> 00:26:42.256
I find it too on the nose.

511
00:26:44.792 --> 00:26:46.425
Oh, hey, look, look,
look, look! A second Chance!


512
00:26:46.428 --> 00:26:47.928
A guitar!

513
00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.163
- Hey, Merry Christmas, sweetie!
- Hey!


514
00:26:52.001 --> 00:26:53.967
I just got it as I said it.

515
00:26:53.969 --> 00:26:56.136
There goes a second Chance,

516
00:26:56.138 --> 00:26:58.272
'cause your...
your name is Chance, and...


517
00:26:58.274 --> 00:27:00.274
And, yeah,
yes, it was corny, okay,


518
00:27:00.276 --> 00:27:02.342
but, my God,
how could I not have said that?


519
00:27:06.048 --> 00:27:09.483
Oh! It's just the one I wanted!

520
00:27:10.452 --> 00:27:12.419
Oh, it must be
from Grandpa Jack.


521
00:27:12.421 --> 00:27:15.055
Grandpa, he's amazing.

522
00:27:15.057 --> 00:27:17.124
We told him you'd been
taking lessons, sweetie.


523
00:27:19.461 --> 00:27:21.461
Ah, Grandpa Jack.

524
00:27:21.463 --> 00:27:23.096
Couldn't make Christmas
once again,


525
00:27:23.098 --> 00:27:25.232
but look at those
nice presents he sent.


526
00:27:25.234 --> 00:27:28.936
I would have loved him,
no matter what.


527
00:27:28.938 --> 00:27:30.604
Mm-mm-mm. Let's put away

528
00:27:30.605 --> 00:27:32.271
that social media following
of yours for now, okay?


529
00:27:32.274 --> 00:27:34.041
This is about you, Cherry Bear.

530
00:27:34.043 --> 00:27:35.275
Don't call me that.

531
00:27:37.313 --> 00:27:40.180
Oh, that guitar,
that gift of love.


532
00:27:40.182 --> 00:27:42.616
It sure pushed you to practice,
huh? Am I wrong about that?


533
00:27:43.519 --> 00:27:45.319
Why are we here?

534
00:27:45.321 --> 00:27:48.021
Well, you know,
being a spirit has some perks.


535
00:27:48.023 --> 00:27:50.090
One, I get to help you
find your way.


536
00:27:50.092 --> 00:27:53.026
And, I consider
the most important,


537
00:27:53.028 --> 00:27:54.494
the drinks are free!

538
00:27:55.998 --> 00:27:58.131
That thing is
gonna make me so rich.


539
00:27:58.133 --> 00:27:59.399
Okay, I have
a notion that you're


540
00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:02.102
not exactly getting
the point of this,


541
00:28:02.104 --> 00:28:03.503
so we might need
to do this again.


542
00:28:03.505 --> 00:28:05.539
You know what?
Let's see it one more time.


543
00:28:10.546 --> 00:28:12.412
Chance: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

544
00:28:12.414 --> 00:28:15.382
Are we both watching the same
ghostly flashback thing?


545
00:28:15.384 --> 00:28:19.152
Because what I see
is a star in the making.


546
00:28:20.456 --> 00:28:23.223
Kiddo, we have
got some work to do.


547
00:28:28.397 --> 00:28:30.030
Oh, I remember this.

548
00:28:30.032 --> 00:28:32.232
This is the day. This is...

549
00:28:32.234 --> 00:28:34.468
This is "A.G.T.S.,"
the show that made me famous.


550
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.136
Bingo! You hit that one

551
00:28:36.138 --> 00:28:37.471
straight out of the ballpark,
sweetheart.


552
00:28:37.473 --> 00:28:38.672
But now tell me this.

553
00:28:39.575 --> 00:28:41.608
Do you remember everything?

554
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:44.077
But, Mom,
what if I forget the words?


555
00:28:44.079 --> 00:28:45.512
What if I don't want
to do it anymore?


556
00:28:45.514 --> 00:28:47.381
Is it too late
to tell them not to?


557
00:28:47.383 --> 00:28:49.182
You could do
whatever you want to do.


558
00:28:49.184 --> 00:28:51.284
I don't think
you want to quit. Do you?


559
00:28:51.286 --> 00:28:53.553
Plus, you're gonna
totally kill it.


560
00:28:53.555 --> 00:28:55.155
Thanks, Mom.

561
00:28:55.157 --> 00:28:57.124
All right.
I'm gonna get us some water.


562
00:28:57.126 --> 00:28:58.342
Okay.

563
00:28:59.561 --> 00:29:02.295
Don't worry, kid. You nail it.

564
00:29:05.034 --> 00:29:07.067
Without people like us,

565
00:29:07.069 --> 00:29:10.070
some people don't get to eat
or... or pay the bills.


566
00:29:10.072 --> 00:29:12.539
Like, they depend on us
for survival.


567
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:14.574
People like us?

568
00:29:14.576 --> 00:29:18.178
Yeah, you know, stars.

569
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:21.114
I don't think so.

570
00:29:22.151 --> 00:29:24.117
Well, you look
like a star to me.


571
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.720
That's really sweet.

572
00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.357
Let me give you
a piece of advice.


573
00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:32.359
Always look out for number one.

574
00:29:32.361 --> 00:29:34.694
Give them your talent.
That's what the people want.


575
00:29:38.434 --> 00:29:39.550
Keep the rest for yourself.

576
00:29:39.551 --> 00:29:40.667
Do you really think
I could be a star?


577
00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:45.405
Oh, hello.

578
00:29:45.407 --> 00:29:47.207
Who's your new friend?

579
00:29:47.209 --> 00:29:50.477
Mom! It's Jason Cleavers.

580
00:29:50.479 --> 00:29:52.245
Are you one
of the contestants, too?


581
00:29:52.247 --> 00:29:54.481
That's cute.

582
00:29:54.483 --> 00:29:56.316
I'm the host.

583
00:30:01.356 --> 00:30:03.223
I didn't know.

584
00:30:03.225 --> 00:30:05.092
And what am I
supposed to learn


585
00:30:05.094 --> 00:30:06.493
about my mom embarrassing me?

586
00:30:06.495 --> 00:30:08.395
It wasn't about...

587
00:30:08.397 --> 00:30:11.364
It was about Jason
giving you bad advice.


588
00:30:11.366 --> 00:30:14.101
You know what?
Let's look a little forward.


589
00:30:14.103 --> 00:30:15.135
How 'bout a year?

590
00:30:21.276 --> 00:30:23.610
Is that Brian?

591
00:30:23.612 --> 00:30:25.612
I haven't thought
about this in years.


592
00:30:25.614 --> 00:30:29.249
Mm, he's thought
about it a lot.


593
00:30:32.588 --> 00:30:34.187
Yeah?

594
00:30:34.189 --> 00:30:36.657
Uh, hi, Mr. Love.

595
00:30:36.658 --> 00:30:39.126
I'm here to pick up Chance
for the Christmas Eve dance.


596
00:30:39.128 --> 00:30:41.495
Brian. Looking sharp, buddy.

597
00:30:42.598 --> 00:30:43.597
Hmm.

598
00:30:43.599 --> 00:30:44.598
Cherry Bea...Oh.

599
00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.765
I'm here.

600
00:30:47.503 --> 00:30:48.602
Wow.

601
00:30:48.604 --> 00:30:49.769
Hi.

602
00:30:50.672 --> 00:30:52.339
You look beautiful.

603
00:30:53.275 --> 00:30:55.208
Thank you. So do you.

604
00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.544
Hey, let me get a picture.
Mom will kill me if I don't.


605
00:30:57.546 --> 00:30:58.645
- Okay.
- All right.


606
00:30:58.647 --> 00:31:00.180
Get together now.

607
00:31:00.182 --> 00:31:02.716
All right, ready?

608
00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.687
Oh, yeah, that's awesome.

609
00:31:06.688 --> 00:31:08.155
All right, listen.

610
00:31:08.157 --> 00:31:10.290
Have fun. Drive safe, okay?

611
00:31:10.292 --> 00:31:11.558
- You got it, sir.
- Dad.


612
00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.593
11:00. 11:00.

613
00:31:13.595 --> 00:31:16.429
Agh, that dress!
What was I thinking?


614
00:31:16.431 --> 00:31:19.332
No, no. Shh, shh, shh.
This is the cute part.


615
00:31:21.503 --> 00:31:22.702
- Right here.
- Oh, right there.


616
00:31:22.704 --> 00:31:23.737
- Yeah!
- Okay.


617
00:31:23.739 --> 00:31:25.705
- Oh, my God.
- Gotcha.


618
00:31:27.543 --> 00:31:28.675
Chance: Thank you.

619
00:31:34.616 --> 00:31:36.550
Oh, boy.

620
00:31:36.552 --> 00:31:38.518
And now the sad part.

621
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.789
Jason?

622
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:44.591
What are you doing here?

623
00:31:44.593 --> 00:31:47.194
I got a show tonight,
lost my opener.


624
00:31:47.196 --> 00:31:48.595
How'd you like
to open for me?


625
00:31:48.597 --> 00:31:49.729
Are you serious?

626
00:31:49.731 --> 00:31:51.698
You wanna be a star?

627
00:31:57.673 --> 00:31:58.838
Chance.

628
00:32:12.621 --> 00:32:14.521
I'd like to go home now.

629
00:32:14.523 --> 00:32:16.489
Even after
you broke his heart,


630
00:32:16.491 --> 00:32:18.692
he followed you around
like a puppy dog.


631
00:32:18.694 --> 00:32:22.829
Now he does your bidding
without ever a word of thanks.


632
00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.304
I never meant to hurt him.

633
00:32:34.643 --> 00:32:37.711
He's the best friend
I've ever had.


634
00:32:37.713 --> 00:32:39.546
Do you ever tell him that?

635
00:32:44.253 --> 00:32:46.319
I said
I'd like to go home now.


636
00:32:46.321 --> 00:32:47.320
Mm-hmm.

637
00:32:47.322 --> 00:32:50.323
I said now!

638
00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.668
...designed to keep
the people in check.


639
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.371
And so we celebrate.

640
00:33:06.391 --> 00:33:08.408
# Love and happiness #

641
00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:10.310
Christmas is...

642
00:33:10.312 --> 00:33:13.713
joy, family...

643
00:33:13.715 --> 00:33:15.348
Okay.

644
00:33:17.419 --> 00:33:18.785
Deuces.

645
00:33:22.691 --> 00:33:24.791
Are you kidding me?

646
00:33:31.333 --> 00:33:32.499
Mm.

647
00:33:32.501 --> 00:33:33.566
Hey...

648
00:33:34.636 --> 00:33:36.836
that was pretty intense.

649
00:33:36.838 --> 00:33:39.506
Never met someone
so anti-Santa before.


650
00:33:39.508 --> 00:33:40.573
Nah, I love Santa.

651
00:33:40.575 --> 00:33:42.575
He... He roasted me last week,

652
00:33:42.577 --> 00:33:44.844
so I had to hit him back.
You know what I mean?


653
00:33:44.846 --> 00:33:47.380
So are you
the, uh, entitled rich girl?


654
00:33:47.382 --> 00:33:49.382
Excuse me?

655
00:33:49.384 --> 00:33:51.551
I-I'm supposed to let you
stew in your own guilt,


656
00:33:51.553 --> 00:33:53.453
and then you get all scared
with anticipation,


657
00:33:53.455 --> 00:33:56.589
but, uh,
it's not really my style.


658
00:33:56.591 --> 00:33:58.725
You know what? I'm good.

659
00:33:58.727 --> 00:34:00.460
Hold on, Second Chance.

660
00:34:00.462 --> 00:34:01.561
Don't touch me!

661
00:34:02.731 --> 00:34:04.464
I got a job to do,

662
00:34:04.466 --> 00:34:06.800
and your leaving wouldn't
allow me to accomplish that,


663
00:34:06.802 --> 00:34:09.336
so why don't you
do us both a favor


664
00:34:09.338 --> 00:34:12.339
and just drop the
"I'm better than everyone" act?


665
00:34:12.341 --> 00:34:13.940
Okay, look. I don't know
what you're getting at,


666
00:34:13.942 --> 00:34:15.608
but I don't even know you!

667
00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:17.410
Well, I know you.

668
00:34:18.413 --> 00:34:20.163
Fifth grade,
you stole a candy bar.


669
00:34:20.164 --> 00:34:21.914
Sixth grade, put gum
in Cindy Fletcher's hair


670
00:34:21.917 --> 00:34:24.551
at recess and blamed it
on Frankie Fletcher.


671
00:34:24.553 --> 00:34:27.354
Oh, same here.
Cheated on a test.


672
00:34:27.356 --> 00:34:28.755
Then eighth grade...Hoo!

673
00:34:28.757 --> 00:34:30.757
Okay, okay, I get it.

674
00:34:30.759 --> 00:34:34.928
You're a stalker,
a really committed one.


675
00:34:34.930 --> 00:34:36.529
Super impressive, really.

676
00:34:42.571 --> 00:34:44.037
I'm a ghost.
You got that part, right?


677
00:34:45.507 --> 00:34:47.474
If you run, I'll catch you.

678
00:34:47.476 --> 00:34:49.509
If you hide, I'll find you.

679
00:34:49.511 --> 00:34:51.878
Think of me like you
would think of a cold.


680
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:54.848
You got me.
I'm gonna be here for a while.


681
00:34:54.850 --> 00:34:56.683
You gotta put up with me.

682
00:34:56.685 --> 00:34:58.551
Then I'll be gone.

683
00:34:58.553 --> 00:35:00.420
You want me
to think of you like a cold?


684
00:35:00.422 --> 00:35:01.688
That's the best
you can come up with?


685
00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:03.523
I'm thinking on the fly here.

686
00:35:03.525 --> 00:35:04.824
Look, shut up, and let's ride.

687
00:35:12.701 --> 00:35:13.733
We didn't go anywhere.

688
00:35:13.735 --> 00:35:15.402
You gotta move your feet.

689
00:35:15.404 --> 00:35:16.603
If you wanna go somewhere,

690
00:35:16.605 --> 00:35:17.937
I'm parked out front.

691
00:35:19.641 --> 00:35:21.074
Fine.

692
00:35:26.548 --> 00:35:29.849
Okay. So you have
some type of ghost magic


693
00:35:29.851 --> 00:35:32.886
where you can transport,
but we're in your car?


694
00:35:32.888 --> 00:35:34.854
I like driving.

695
00:35:34.856 --> 00:35:36.923
Well, at least
my dreams are creative.


696
00:35:36.925 --> 00:35:38.958
Baby, I'm the Ghost
of Christmas Present.


697
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.927
You're the Ghost
of Christmas Presents?


698
00:35:40.929 --> 00:35:42.629
Present.

699
00:35:43.565 --> 00:35:45.632
- Present!
- Oh.


700
00:35:45.634 --> 00:35:47.567
Guess you're awake now, huh?

701
00:35:47.569 --> 00:35:49.969
Now get on board
with the process.


702
00:36:03.618 --> 00:36:05.885
Okay, okay.

703
00:36:05.887 --> 00:36:07.987
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

704
00:36:07.989 --> 00:36:09.556
Wonderful.

705
00:36:10.625 --> 00:36:12.725
So, where are we going?

706
00:36:12.727 --> 00:36:14.127
Almost there.

707
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.313
Where's there?

708
00:36:17.314 --> 00:36:18.997
Well, you never gave him
a housewarming gift,


709
00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.667
and you never, ever
let your driver


710
00:36:20.669 --> 00:36:21.768
drop him off first.

711
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:23.286
Look,

712
00:36:23.287 --> 00:36:24.803
can we just be done
with all of this?


713
00:36:24.806 --> 00:36:27.540
Oh, I can maybe give you
something that you want,


714
00:36:27.542 --> 00:36:29.809
and you could tell your boss
or whoever's in charge


715
00:36:29.811 --> 00:36:31.744
that you got the job done?

716
00:36:31.746 --> 00:36:33.480
Are you trying to bribe me?

717
00:36:33.482 --> 00:36:34.681
Well...

718
00:36:34.683 --> 00:36:35.882
Girl, please!

719
00:36:36.885 --> 00:36:38.585
Your assistant
has nothing in here


720
00:36:38.587 --> 00:36:40.887
but condiments and pickles.
Are pickles a condiment?


721
00:36:40.889 --> 00:36:43.056
What are we doing
in my assistant's kitchen?


722
00:36:43.058 --> 00:36:44.624
Your choices, boo.

723
00:36:44.626 --> 00:36:46.092
My choices?

724
00:36:46.094 --> 00:36:47.660
Let's have a look.

725
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.039
Hey, Dad.

726
00:37:00.041 --> 00:37:01.808
How you guys holding up?

727
00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:05.578
Hey, champ. We're doing okay.

728
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.180
Did you get that girl
to marry you yet?


729
00:37:10.819 --> 00:37:12.519
Oh, I don't know. Not yet.

730
00:37:12.521 --> 00:37:15.655
Uh, she's, you know, busy.

731
00:37:15.657 --> 00:37:17.056
He has a girlfriend?

732
00:37:17.058 --> 00:37:18.124
Nope.

733
00:37:21.796 --> 00:37:22.929
Uh...

734
00:37:22.931 --> 00:37:26.900
my cards are maxed out.

735
00:37:26.902 --> 00:37:29.936
Did you send the transfer
for the week?


736
00:37:29.938 --> 00:37:31.871
Yeah, I
-I just sent it.

737
00:37:33.608 --> 00:37:34.607
Is that Brian?

738
00:37:34.609 --> 00:37:36.009
Oh, hey.

739
00:37:36.011 --> 00:37:37.043
Come on.

740
00:37:37.045 --> 00:37:38.678
Look who's awake!

741
00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:39.679
Hey.

742
00:37:39.681 --> 00:37:40.680
There she is!

743
00:37:40.682 --> 00:37:41.915
How you doing, beautiful?

744
00:37:41.917 --> 00:37:42.949
How they treating you?

745
00:37:42.951 --> 00:37:45.818
Um, not too bad.

746
00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.021
Oh, I'll be dancing
out of here tomorrow.


747
00:37:50.625 --> 00:37:53.927
How are you, Brian?
How's your week been?


748
00:37:53.929 --> 00:37:57.730
Aw, my day was good,
and I'm fine, Mama.


749
00:37:57.732 --> 00:38:00.633
I just wish I was
right there, right next to you.


750
00:38:00.635 --> 00:38:02.101
I'm sorry I'm not.

751
00:38:02.103 --> 00:38:04.904
Don't you worry yourself,
sweetheart.


752
00:38:04.906 --> 00:38:06.739
We understand.

753
00:38:06.741 --> 00:38:08.908
We'll spend Christmas
together next year.


754
00:38:09.844 --> 00:38:11.578
We are so proud of you.

755
00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.579
Yeah.

756
00:38:13.648 --> 00:38:15.114
Thank you, Mom.

757
00:38:16.751 --> 00:38:18.184
Oh. Uh, feeling...

758
00:38:18.186 --> 00:38:20.153
No, i-it's all right,

759
00:38:20.155 --> 00:38:21.721
It's okay. It's okay.

760
00:38:21.723 --> 00:38:23.690
- Just hold on.
- Hey, what's going on?


761
00:38:23.692 --> 00:38:24.691
I'll get somebody.

762
00:38:24.693 --> 00:38:27.026
Is Mom all right? Mom!

763
00:38:29.064 --> 00:38:30.997
Sh
-She's okay.

764
00:38:30.999 --> 00:38:33.733
Uh, the I.V. just popped out.

765
00:38:36.171 --> 00:38:37.804
Okay. All right.

766
00:38:38.807 --> 00:38:41.674
Just a second, pal.

767
00:38:41.676 --> 00:38:42.675
Nurse?

768
00:39:02.731 --> 00:39:05.665
Your choices
have consequences.


769
00:39:05.667 --> 00:39:07.934
My choices?

770
00:39:07.936 --> 00:39:10.236
I chose to give him a job.

771
00:39:10.238 --> 00:39:14.173
I chose to pay him
more than fair wage.


772
00:39:14.175 --> 00:39:16.175
I didn't choose
to make his mom sick.


773
00:39:16.177 --> 00:39:18.878
He sends every dime home.

774
00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:22.849
His father spends every moment
he can with her at the hospital.


775
00:39:22.851 --> 00:39:24.183
He left his job at the plant.

776
00:39:24.185 --> 00:39:26.719
Well, then,
I'm happy Brian's paycheck


777
00:39:26.721 --> 00:39:28.655
allows for him
to take care of his family.


778
00:39:28.657 --> 00:39:30.957
You think what you pay him

779
00:39:30.959 --> 00:39:33.126
is...is taking care
of that woman?


780
00:39:33.128 --> 00:39:34.994
He sends her everything,
and it still


781
00:39:34.996 --> 00:39:36.796
barely just keeps her
in the hospital.


782
00:39:36.798 --> 00:39:39.699
Well, why didn't he tell me
that his mother was sick?


783
00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:42.669
- He did, several times.
- When?


784
00:39:42.671 --> 00:39:44.871
When you yelled at him
to go get your dry cleaning,


785
00:39:44.873 --> 00:39:46.973
when you yelled at him for not
getting a reservation at Enzo's,


786
00:39:46.975 --> 00:39:48.841
when you yelled at him
for using his phone


787
00:39:48.843 --> 00:39:50.943
to deposit your royalty check.

788
00:39:50.945 --> 00:39:52.812
Yeah, okay. I get it.

789
00:39:52.814 --> 00:39:54.047
Father: There we go.

790
00:39:54.049 --> 00:39:56.015
All's well that ends okay.

791
00:39:56.017 --> 00:39:58.117
Uh, I could probably
make it out there within a few...


792
00:40:00.789 --> 00:40:03.189
Uh, shoot, Dad.
I gotta...I gotta take this.


793
00:40:03.191 --> 00:40:04.924
I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay.

794
00:40:04.926 --> 00:40:07.160
I love you. Love to Mom.

795
00:40:07.162 --> 00:40:08.361
All right, bye.

796
00:40:10.732 --> 00:40:12.098
Hey, what's up?

797
00:40:13.234 --> 00:40:15.101
Uh...

798
00:40:15.103 --> 00:40:17.103
yeah, no, not a problem at all.

799
00:40:17.105 --> 00:40:18.705
I
-I could rush over there.

800
00:40:18.707 --> 00:40:19.872
I could be there in...

801
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:26.279
I could be there
in 20 minutes, if that's okay.


802
00:40:26.281 --> 00:40:29.015
Okay, yeah, I-I'm rushing over.
See you soon.


803
00:40:47.001 --> 00:40:48.134
Told you.

804
00:40:49.838 --> 00:40:52.555
You suck.

805
00:40:52.556 --> 00:40:55.273
I didn't make anybody
lose their job or get sick.


806
00:40:55.276 --> 00:40:57.276
It's not my fault
that the healthcare system


807
00:40:57.278 --> 00:40:59.345
in this country's
so messed up.


808
00:40:59.347 --> 00:41:01.914
What, are you gonna
blame that on me, too?


809
00:41:01.916 --> 00:41:03.015
Yeah.

810
00:41:05.887 --> 00:41:07.887
Shall we?

811
00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.089
- Goose!
- No, no, an eagle.


812
00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:11.289
- Uh, duck! A lame duck!
- Keep going!


813
00:41:11.292 --> 00:41:12.759
You guys know what it is.

814
00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:15.328
- Aww!
- Aw, no talking!


815
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.096
Come on. You can't talk.

816
00:41:17.098 --> 00:41:18.531
Sit down.

817
00:41:18.532 --> 00:41:19.965
So what held her up this time?

818
00:41:19.968 --> 00:41:22.335
Uh, she had a meeting
with a big music executive.


819
00:41:22.337 --> 00:41:24.137
She's really excited about it.

820
00:41:24.139 --> 00:41:26.906
She couldn't schedule it
for the day after Christmas?


821
00:41:27.976 --> 00:41:30.042
- Come on. Your turn, sweetie.
- Okay.


822
00:41:30.044 --> 00:41:32.311
- Ready?
- Yeah.


823
00:41:34.783 --> 00:41:36.048
Um...

824
00:41:37.051 --> 00:41:39.018
Bruce, did you cut one?

825
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.120
Oh, very funny, Stinky!

826
00:41:41.122 --> 00:41:42.321
Uh, smelly!

827
00:41:42.323 --> 00:41:43.923
Gross? Yucky?

828
00:41:43.925 --> 00:41:46.859
D
-Disgusting. It's smelly.

829
00:41:47.796 --> 00:41:49.796
Oh! Chance!

830
00:41:49.798 --> 00:41:51.030
Chance.

831
00:41:51.032 --> 00:41:53.232
Hey, hey, now! Be nice!

832
00:41:53.234 --> 00:41:55.334
No, wait. Actually,
it's really close enough.


833
00:41:55.336 --> 00:41:56.869
Spoiled.

834
00:41:56.871 --> 00:41:58.271
Spoiled?

835
00:41:58.273 --> 00:42:00.873
They think I'm spoiled?

836
00:42:00.875 --> 00:42:02.909
I worked my butt off
to get where I am!


837
00:42:02.911 --> 00:42:05.278
What about that boy
that follows her around, Brian?


838
00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.279
They dating?

839
00:42:06.281 --> 00:42:07.346
I wish they were.

840
00:42:07.348 --> 00:42:08.948
He's really good to her.

841
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:10.183
I love him. He's amazing.

842
00:42:10.185 --> 00:42:11.818
He's actually her assistant now.

843
00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:15.254
- Wow, her assistant.
- Hmm.


844
00:42:15.256 --> 00:42:17.223
Hey, uh, why don't we get
another cheese plate, yeah?


845
00:42:17.225 --> 00:42:18.424
Yeah.

846
00:42:20.128 --> 00:42:21.544
More cheese, Stinky?

847
00:42:21.545 --> 00:42:22.961
Yes, that would be good.

848
00:42:22.964 --> 00:42:24.130
- I'll take some wine.
- Okay.


849
00:42:36.244 --> 00:42:39.312
I know you're disappointed
she didn't come,


850
00:42:39.314 --> 00:42:41.280
but she's
our workaholic little girl.


851
00:42:43.852 --> 00:42:44.917
Did you try to call her?

852
00:42:44.919 --> 00:42:47.386
Yeah. She isn't answering.

853
00:42:47.388 --> 00:42:49.856
Maybe she changed her mind
and she's already on the plane.


854
00:42:49.858 --> 00:42:51.057
Yeah, maybe.

855
00:42:57.332 --> 00:43:00.132
Your father worked hard
to keep a roof over your head,


856
00:43:00.134 --> 00:43:02.301
put food on the table,
clothes on your back.


857
00:43:02.303 --> 00:43:07.073
Yeah, and I'm grateful,
but I don't owe anyone anything!


858
00:43:07.075 --> 00:43:09.075
I'm not talking about money.

859
00:43:09.077 --> 00:43:11.143
He wouldn't take it, anyway.

860
00:43:11.145 --> 00:43:12.411
She never even
so much as calls


861
00:43:12.413 --> 00:43:13.880
unless she needs something.

862
00:43:13.882 --> 00:43:15.448
- She's such a brat.
- Yeah.


863
00:43:15.449 --> 00:43:17.015
I mean, she's gotta
be worth millions now.


864
00:43:17.018 --> 00:43:19.151
It's not like she can't
take off the weekend and spend...


865
00:43:19.153 --> 00:43:21.921
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, hey, you got the cheese.


866
00:43:21.923 --> 00:43:23.422
All right, Karen,
it's your turn.


867
00:43:23.424 --> 00:43:25.358
Get up there,
and make a fool of yourself.


868
00:43:28.897 --> 00:43:30.429
- All right. All right.
- Here you go.


869
00:43:30.431 --> 00:43:32.198
There you go. Sorry.

870
00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.101
- Oh, hey, I'll be right back.
- Okay.


871
00:43:46.314 --> 00:43:48.047
What the heck?

872
00:44:03.164 --> 00:44:04.397
What's the card say?

873
00:44:05.934 --> 00:44:08.167
"Merry Christmas.
Love, Chance."


874
00:44:09.337 --> 00:44:11.638
What?

875
00:44:11.639 --> 00:44:13.940
What?!
I didn't send them anything!


876
00:44:13.942 --> 00:44:15.975
Oh, Brian, that idiot!

877
00:44:15.977 --> 00:44:17.443
That was supposed
to go to Roger!


878
00:44:17.445 --> 00:44:20.012
That guy
takes good care of you.


879
00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:24.016
What? You need a road map?

880
00:44:24.018 --> 00:44:28.387
He's trying to patch up things
between you and your parents.


881
00:44:28.389 --> 00:44:30.489
If I'd know any better,
I'd say he loves you.


882
00:44:32.994 --> 00:44:35.127
Let's go set this baby up!

883
00:44:37.999 --> 00:44:39.298
Can we go, please?

884
00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:40.466
Jason isn't texting me back.

885
00:44:49.444 --> 00:44:50.927
Jason, baby,

886
00:44:50.928 --> 00:44:52.411
I'm so sorry
that I threw you out!


887
00:44:52.413 --> 00:44:54.046
Look, how hard is

888
00:44:54.048 --> 00:44:56.983
the "no one can see or hear us"
part of this?


889
00:44:58.769 --> 00:45:00.552
I didn't realize
we were still doing the thing.


890
00:45:00.555 --> 00:45:03.055
The thing where we
transported into the back


891
00:45:03.057 --> 00:45:05.024
of a moving vehicle?
You missed that?


892
00:45:05.026 --> 00:45:07.059
Okay, you have
a serious attitude problem.


893
00:45:07.061 --> 00:45:09.395
No. I have a woman
who won't acknowledge the fact


894
00:45:09.397 --> 00:45:11.530
that she has not taken
one positive move


895
00:45:11.532 --> 00:45:13.566
toward fixing herself.

896
00:45:13.568 --> 00:45:15.534
Take a chill pill, okay?

897
00:45:15.536 --> 00:45:17.403
You chill!

898
00:45:17.405 --> 00:45:20.172
She is still texting me!
The nerve.


899
00:45:20.174 --> 00:45:21.307
I heard that.

900
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:23.409
I
-I made her!

901
00:45:23.411 --> 00:45:25.211
God! Without me,
she would be doing


902
00:45:25.213 --> 00:45:28.347
the fair circuit
somewhere in Podunk, Nowhere.


903
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:30.416
She is nothing.

904
00:45:30.418 --> 00:45:34.220
Nobody treats J. Cleavers
like that, nobody.


905
00:45:34.222 --> 00:45:38.024
I'm nothing? You're nothing!

906
00:45:38.026 --> 00:45:42.194
You're a has-been pop star
with one good album, maybe!


907
00:45:42.196 --> 00:45:44.196
And three of the songs sucked.

908
00:45:44.198 --> 00:45:45.564
Ah, there she is.

909
00:45:45.566 --> 00:45:47.099
Who's she?

910
00:45:47.101 --> 00:45:50.436
Oh, you wouldn't dare!

911
00:45:50.438 --> 00:45:52.304
I can't believe
this is happening!


912
00:45:52.306 --> 00:45:54.206
This is amazing.

913
00:45:54.208 --> 00:45:56.509
Thank you so much.

914
00:45:56.511 --> 00:45:58.177
Merry Christmas to me!

915
00:45:58.179 --> 00:46:00.312
Ooh! Jason Cleaver,
if you are cheating on me,


916
00:46:00.314 --> 00:46:01.580
I'm gonna wring
your scrawny little neck!


917
00:46:01.582 --> 00:46:03.115
You hear me?

918
00:46:03.117 --> 00:46:04.383
There's nothing
you can do now!


919
00:46:04.385 --> 00:46:06.552
Jump pump your brakes!
Chill out!


920
00:46:06.554 --> 00:46:09.588
So, uh, what are
these questions you have for me?


921
00:46:09.590 --> 00:46:12.591
Okay, how do I get an agent?
Also, who's your agent,


922
00:46:12.593 --> 00:46:14.527
and do I take the band with me
to meetings?


923
00:46:14.529 --> 00:46:17.063
And how do I get my demo out?
Should I send emails,


924
00:46:17.065 --> 00:46:18.364
or is it better
to send hard copies?


925
00:46:18.366 --> 00:46:20.399
- Who do I talk to about...
- Okay, whoa.


926
00:46:20.401 --> 00:46:24.470
First thing that I do
is breathe, relax.


927
00:46:24.472 --> 00:46:26.372
Excitement shows
your lack of experience,


928
00:46:26.374 --> 00:46:30.543
so be bold.
Demand their attention.


929
00:46:30.545 --> 00:46:32.545
There's a certain
kind of decorum


930
00:46:32.547 --> 00:46:34.346
expected from people like us.

931
00:46:34.348 --> 00:46:36.549
People like us?

932
00:46:36.551 --> 00:46:39.285
He wouldn't.

933
00:46:39.287 --> 00:46:40.453
Stars.

934
00:46:41.355 --> 00:46:43.456
I'm not a star.

935
00:46:43.458 --> 00:46:45.257
You look like a star to me.

936
00:46:45.259 --> 00:46:46.559
Oh, you skeeze-ball!

937
00:46:46.561 --> 00:46:48.160
You used that line on me.

938
00:46:48.162 --> 00:46:50.696
Oh, you are a piece of garbage!

939
00:46:52.633 --> 00:46:54.467
Nice mentor you got there.

940
00:46:54.469 --> 00:46:57.236
You're such a lucky girl.

941
00:46:57.238 --> 00:46:59.105
I don't need him.

942
00:46:59.107 --> 00:47:01.574
My album's gonna outsell his.

943
00:47:01.576 --> 00:47:03.576
My fans are gonna
tear him apart.


944
00:47:03.578 --> 00:47:06.378
Your fans?

945
00:47:09.617 --> 00:47:14.220
Wow. You just take me
to the nicest of places.


946
00:47:14.222 --> 00:47:15.922
Remember that pathetic fan

947
00:47:15.923 --> 00:47:17.623
with her daughter that was
trying to get your autograph,


948
00:47:17.625 --> 00:47:19.191
just dying to meet you?

949
00:47:19.193 --> 00:47:21.360
Oh, no, please.
Can we just go home, okay?


950
00:47:21.362 --> 00:47:23.596
Look, I get it. I know
what you're trying to tell me.


951
00:47:23.598 --> 00:47:25.631
That autograph
would have been the only treat


952
00:47:25.633 --> 00:47:27.633
she could give
her daughter this year.


953
00:47:27.635 --> 00:47:30.402
Great. Wonderful.

954
00:47:33.174 --> 00:47:38.210
Um, I didn't know that you
were gonna be so late tonight.


955
00:47:38.212 --> 00:47:40.446
I-I have to be
at Christmas tomorrow


956
00:47:40.448 --> 00:47:41.714
at 9 A.M. with my parents.

957
00:47:41.716 --> 00:47:44.216
I'll pay you double.

958
00:47:44.218 --> 00:47:45.384
You don't have to do that.

959
00:47:45.386 --> 00:47:47.253
No, it's holiday pay.

960
00:47:47.255 --> 00:47:50.189
Um, I get paid on Friday.
Is that all right?


961
00:47:50.191 --> 00:47:51.807
I mean, okay. I mean,

962
00:47:51.808 --> 00:47:53.424
but what time are you
gonna be back tonight?


963
00:47:55.496 --> 00:47:59.231
I don't know,
but please, please just stay.


964
00:47:59.233 --> 00:48:01.634
I can't miss this shift.

965
00:48:01.636 --> 00:48:03.269
I
-I already swapped

966
00:48:03.271 --> 00:48:05.404
so that I could take Becca
to go see Chance Love.


967
00:48:05.406 --> 00:48:07.273
Oh, how was the concert?

968
00:48:07.275 --> 00:48:08.674
Oh, we didn't
get to see her play.


969
00:48:08.676 --> 00:48:11.177
Just to try to get an autograph.

970
00:48:11.179 --> 00:48:14.780
We don't have
the money for tickets right now.


971
00:48:16.751 --> 00:48:18.484
Um...

972
00:48:20.321 --> 00:48:22.321
maybe you should find
some other child care.


973
00:48:22.323 --> 00:48:24.456
I can't afford day care.

974
00:48:25.426 --> 00:48:26.659
I mean, I can't work for free.

975
00:48:26.661 --> 00:48:28.327
I mean, I would if I could,

976
00:48:28.329 --> 00:48:31.530
but I've gotta
pay my bills, too.


977
00:48:31.532 --> 00:48:34.200
I know. I know.

978
00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:36.268
Please just watch her for today.

979
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:40.739
And I'll pay you on Friday for
next week in advance, I promise.


980
00:48:40.741 --> 00:48:43.309
Okay, but if
Friday doesn't happen,


981
00:48:43.311 --> 00:48:45.311
you're gonna have
to find another sitter.


982
00:48:45.313 --> 00:48:47.780
- A-And you understand, right?
- Oh, I do.


983
00:48:47.782 --> 00:48:49.248
Oh, God, I do.

984
00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:50.616
Um, I gotta go. Thank you.

985
00:48:50.618 --> 00:48:53.219
Thank you.
I'll be back in the morning.


986
00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:56.388
Um, thank you.

987
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:58.224
I really do appreciate you.

988
00:48:58.226 --> 00:48:59.858
Okay, bye.

989
00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:08.500
What a sweet woman.

990
00:49:08.502 --> 00:49:10.636
Okay, now can we go home?

991
00:49:15.643 --> 00:49:17.243
Becca.

992
00:49:17.245 --> 00:49:19.545
Girl, you gotta go to sleep.

993
00:49:19.547 --> 00:49:22.648
Come on. Why don't you lay down?

994
00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:24.650
Besides, tomorrow is Christmas,

995
00:49:24.652 --> 00:49:28.254
and Santa is not gonna come
if you aren't asleep.


996
00:49:28.256 --> 00:49:32.458
Mama says Santa
can't come this year.


997
00:49:34.695 --> 00:49:36.729
Well, adults
don't know everything,


998
00:49:36.731 --> 00:49:38.731
so why don't you hush up
and get some sleep?


999
00:49:38.733 --> 00:49:40.299
And I betcha he might

1000
00:49:40.301 --> 00:49:41.700
just have something for you
in the morning.


1001
00:49:41.702 --> 00:49:43.435
You think so?

1002
00:49:43.437 --> 00:49:45.838
Well, you don't know
if you don't go to sleep.


1003
00:49:50.645 --> 00:49:53.579
I'm gonna
leave this one on for you.


1004
00:49:53.581 --> 00:49:54.813
Good night, girl.

1005
00:49:58.586 --> 00:50:01.754
It's not like my autograph
would have paid for their bills.


1006
00:50:01.756 --> 00:50:03.656
You're right. It's worthless.

1007
00:50:03.658 --> 00:50:05.524
But it would have made
that little girl's Christmas


1008
00:50:05.526 --> 00:50:06.692
just a little bit brighter.

1009
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:11.397
Well, my agent told me
that I can't just sign


1010
00:50:11.399 --> 00:50:12.865
everything that gets
shoved in my face.


1011
00:50:12.867 --> 00:50:14.633
Otherwise,
it devalues my autograph,


1012
00:50:14.635 --> 00:50:16.402
and I wouldn't get
to sign at conventions.


1013
00:50:16.404 --> 00:50:18.054
I see.
It's your agent's fault.


1014
00:50:18.055 --> 00:50:19.705
Let's see what he has to say.

1015
00:50:21.676 --> 00:50:23.575
Yep.

1016
00:50:23.577 --> 00:50:26.512
That blonde little tyrant
wants me to get her a meeting


1017
00:50:26.514 --> 00:50:29.315
with Roger Grossman
of Grossman Records.


1018
00:50:29.317 --> 00:50:30.916
- Is he talking about me?
- Nope.


1019
00:50:30.918 --> 00:50:33.552
Brought you here to listen
to him talk about someone else.


1020
00:50:33.554 --> 00:50:35.454
No, I did not call him.

1021
00:50:35.456 --> 00:50:39.925
She's a diva. I don't want him
thinking I work with crazies.


1022
00:50:39.927 --> 00:50:42.594
But now her assistant's
trying to get her a meeting,


1023
00:50:42.596 --> 00:50:44.363
so I don't know what to do.

1024
00:50:44.365 --> 00:50:46.565
He didn't call?

1025
00:50:46.567 --> 00:50:48.634
Oh, he's so fired!

1026
00:50:48.636 --> 00:50:50.803
You said you'd been
waiting to hear back!


1027
00:50:50.805 --> 00:50:52.438
You think he's the problem?

1028
00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.740
You think he didn't want
to make a new album


1029
00:50:54.742 --> 00:50:56.675
so he can earn his cut?

1030
00:50:56.677 --> 00:50:58.344
I think he's lost his mind

1031
00:50:58.346 --> 00:51:00.612
if he's not gonna
get me in to see Grossman!


1032
00:51:01.749 --> 00:51:03.382
If she messes this up,

1033
00:51:03.384 --> 00:51:04.616
I'm cutting all ties.

1034
00:51:04.618 --> 00:51:06.552
She treats me like hell, anyway.

1035
00:51:06.554 --> 00:51:09.621
Oh, you think
I treat you like hell now?


1036
00:51:09.623 --> 00:51:11.590
You just wait
until I get ahold of you!


1037
00:51:11.592 --> 00:51:13.492
I'm gonna tear you a new one!

1038
00:51:13.494 --> 00:51:14.760
You ever sent him
a thank-you note


1039
00:51:14.762 --> 00:51:15.794
for everything he's done?

1040
00:51:15.796 --> 00:51:17.896
A Christmas gift?

1041
00:51:17.898 --> 00:51:19.631
Ask him how his day is?

1042
00:51:19.633 --> 00:51:21.467
Take him to lunch? No?

1043
00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.170
Do you take
any other stress meds?


1044
00:51:24.171 --> 00:51:25.771
'Cause I've been
popping these like Tic Tacs,


1045
00:51:25.773 --> 00:51:27.806
and I really don't see
a difference.


1046
00:51:28.776 --> 00:51:29.775
Whoa, Grandma!

1047
00:51:29.777 --> 00:51:31.510
Aren't those illegal?

1048
00:51:31.512 --> 00:51:35.848
Ah, anyway, I will see you
at Christmas breakfast.


1049
00:51:35.850 --> 00:51:37.916
Yep, I know. It's late.

1050
00:51:37.918 --> 00:51:40.652
Gotta get back
to the wife and kids.


1051
00:51:40.654 --> 00:51:42.654
Okay. Merry Christmas.

1052
00:51:42.656 --> 00:51:44.823
Love you, too. Good night.

1053
00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.593
That's his grandma.

1054
00:51:47.595 --> 00:51:50.596
I have a totally different
relationship with mine.


1055
00:51:50.598 --> 00:51:51.997
He's married?

1056
00:51:51.999 --> 00:51:53.932
He has kids?

1057
00:51:55.002 --> 00:51:56.869
How long
has he been your agent?


1058
00:51:58.672 --> 00:52:00.539
Ever since I first started.

1059
00:52:00.541 --> 00:52:02.674
You suck.

1060
00:52:03.677 --> 00:52:06.678
Yeah, you mentioned that.

1061
00:52:10.985 --> 00:52:12.951
Hey, babe.

1062
00:52:12.953 --> 00:52:15.921
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
I-It's so late.


1063
00:52:15.923 --> 00:52:18.557
Look, I-I've just been trying
to close Cleaver's deal


1064
00:52:18.559 --> 00:52:19.625
for the Europe tour.

1065
00:52:20.661 --> 00:52:22.611
Yeah, okay.

1066
00:52:22.612 --> 00:52:24.562
Uh, I'll be home in 15 minutes.

1067
00:52:24.565 --> 00:52:25.964
I love you, too, babe.

1068
00:52:49.757 --> 00:52:52.624
Wow, he has really
gotta get his life together.


1069
00:52:52.626 --> 00:52:54.460
I see why you're so popular.

1070
00:52:54.462 --> 00:52:56.695
Okay, look,
I have had enough of this.


1071
00:52:56.697 --> 00:52:58.831
- Is that it?
- Yes.


1072
00:52:58.833 --> 00:53:01.633
How dare you come
into my life and judge me?


1073
00:53:01.635 --> 00:53:04.470
What gives you the right to kick
a girl when she's down, huh?


1074
00:53:04.472 --> 00:53:05.838
Are you perfect?

1075
00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:07.739
I'm an angel.

1076
00:53:26.594 --> 00:53:27.793
Hello?

1077
00:53:28.829 --> 00:53:30.028
Any more ghosts?

1078
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.130
I have a stick!

1079
00:53:34.969 --> 00:53:36.602
What am I doing?

1080
00:54:34.628 --> 00:54:36.562
Get out! Get out!

1081
00:54:36.564 --> 00:54:39.865
I don't want to do this anymore!
I didn't ask for any of this!


1082
00:54:40.834 --> 00:54:43.902
I'm gonna call the police!

1083
00:54:46.106 --> 00:54:47.606
- 911. What's your emergency?
- Yes! Yes!


1084
00:54:47.608 --> 00:54:49.074
I have an emergency!
I have a stalk...


1085
00:54:49.076 --> 00:54:51.243
Hello?

1086
00:54:54.582 --> 00:54:56.182
Of course.

1087
00:54:56.183 --> 00:54:57.783
I am the third.

1088
00:54:57.785 --> 00:55:00.085
What, did you
die at Comic-Con?


1089
00:55:00.087 --> 00:55:02.187
You will follow.

1090
00:55:04.792 --> 00:55:07.960
Okay. Just let me get dressed.

1091
00:55:07.962 --> 00:55:09.628
You will follow.

1092
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:11.096
Okay.

1093
00:55:11.098 --> 00:55:13.832
Right. Jeez.

1094
00:55:17.037 --> 00:55:19.838
Okay. Okay, right.

1095
00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:20.872
Just...

1096
00:55:20.874 --> 00:55:23.208
Whew.

1097
00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:25.143
Hold on.

1098
00:55:25.145 --> 00:55:27.179
You just had the...

1099
00:55:27.181 --> 00:55:29.181
And...And you...Blehh.

1100
00:55:29.183 --> 00:55:30.816
And now you...

1101
00:55:30.818 --> 00:55:33.285
You gotta admit,
pretty scary, right?


1102
00:55:35.823 --> 00:55:37.723
What is going on?

1103
00:55:37.725 --> 00:55:40.926
Ooh, the old tricks
are the best tricks.


1104
00:55:40.928 --> 00:55:42.094
Got your attention.

1105
00:55:42.096 --> 00:55:43.829
You're trying to scare me?

1106
00:55:43.831 --> 00:55:46.932
Literally the only thing
that I hope to do.


1107
00:55:46.934 --> 00:55:47.966
I don't understand.

1108
00:55:47.968 --> 00:55:51.069
You will get but one view.

1109
00:55:51.071 --> 00:55:53.939
You will not speak
unless prompted.


1110
00:55:53.941 --> 00:55:55.807
You will not move unless told.

1111
00:55:55.809 --> 00:55:58.777
You will not get another chance.

1112
00:56:05.285 --> 00:56:08.787
Girl, you must have
seriously screwed up. Mm.


1113
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:10.289
Okay, let's do this, then.

1114
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:11.790
Let's get it over with.
Wh-What is this?


1115
00:56:11.792 --> 00:56:12.858
Oh, please.

1116
00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:15.227
Don't be a fool.

1117
00:56:15.229 --> 00:56:18.130
It's time to prove
you're worth the effort.


1118
00:56:18.132 --> 00:56:21.050
Don't waste this.

1119
00:56:21.051 --> 00:56:23.969
A Christmas gift like this
only comes once in a lifetime.


1120
00:56:23.971 --> 00:56:25.937
Okay, yeah. I got it.

1121
00:56:25.939 --> 00:56:27.205
So where we going?

1122
00:56:33.681 --> 00:56:37.082
Remember in Hawaii?

1123
00:56:38.719 --> 00:56:42.688
We pestered her until we
got her to try skimboarding.


1124
00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:45.824
Again? I've been here already.

1125
00:56:50.831 --> 00:56:52.998
And she fell,

1126
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.933
bruised her butt so bad.

1127
00:56:54.935 --> 00:56:57.102
Yeah, I remember.

1128
00:56:57.104 --> 00:56:59.037
And she didn't sit for two days.

1129
00:57:08.949 --> 00:57:10.215
Did she, uh...

1130
00:57:13.187 --> 00:57:14.886
Did she go peacefully?

1131
00:57:18.826 --> 00:57:19.958
In her sleep.

1132
00:57:22.796 --> 00:57:24.062
She died?

1133
00:57:25.265 --> 00:57:26.865
She dies?

1134
00:57:28.135 --> 00:57:30.235
What happened?

1135
00:57:30.237 --> 00:57:34.339
I come for her
two weeks before next Christmas.


1136
00:57:36.043 --> 00:57:38.944
Dad, stay as long
as you want, all right?


1137
00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:42.280
Your mom
would be proud of you...


1138
00:57:44.284 --> 00:57:46.218
taking care of your old man.

1139
00:57:49.356 --> 00:57:51.223
Man, it's so strange

1140
00:57:51.225 --> 00:57:53.892
referring to her
in the past tense.


1141
00:57:56.764 --> 00:57:58.964
Yeah. I...

1142
00:57:58.966 --> 00:58:00.999
I still wake up at night...

1143
00:58:02.236 --> 00:58:04.402
expecting her to be next to me.

1144
00:58:08.075 --> 00:58:09.241
God.

1145
00:58:10.377 --> 00:58:13.044
Ah, sorry.

1146
00:58:14.148 --> 00:58:16.848
- Dad, don't worry about it.
- Sorry.


1147
00:58:16.850 --> 00:58:18.450
Just let it all out, okay?

1148
00:58:20.821 --> 00:58:22.120
Let it all out.

1149
00:58:23.056 --> 00:58:25.090
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

1150
00:58:26.293 --> 00:58:28.393
She knew you loved her.

1151
00:58:31.398 --> 00:58:35.300
How 'bout I make us
uh, some tea, yeah?


1152
00:58:35.302 --> 00:58:36.468
Yeah.

1153
00:58:37.905 --> 00:58:38.970
Yeah.

1154
00:58:39.907 --> 00:58:41.072
Okay.

1155
00:58:48.081 --> 00:58:50.115
He's not even there
when she passes?


1156
00:58:51.218 --> 00:58:53.151
So now you care?

1157
00:58:57.991 --> 00:58:59.958
This isn't real!

1158
00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.260
None of this has even happened!

1159
00:59:02.262 --> 00:59:04.229
Y
-You're a liar!

1160
00:59:04.231 --> 00:59:05.363
This is some sick joke that...

1161
00:59:05.365 --> 00:59:07.265
A joke?

1162
00:59:07.267 --> 00:59:10.869
The weak and foolish tempt me.

1163
00:59:10.871 --> 00:59:15.106
The brave laugh in my face.

1164
00:59:15.108 --> 00:59:17.843
I am eternal.

1165
00:59:17.845 --> 00:59:20.445
I am the constant!

1166
00:59:20.447 --> 00:59:23.982
All will come to me in the end!

1167
00:59:23.984 --> 00:59:27.385
I speak only truth!

1168
00:59:32.993 --> 00:59:34.860
Why are you
showing me all this?


1169
00:59:34.862 --> 00:59:40.999
This? This is the result
of your uncaring greed,


1170
00:59:41.001 --> 00:59:44.035
your self-importance...

1171
00:59:45.305 --> 00:59:47.439
your complete blindness

1172
00:59:47.441 --> 00:59:50.976
to the plight of others
who genuinely...


1173
00:59:52.946 --> 00:59:55.013
care about you.

1174
00:59:59.019 --> 01:00:01.119
You have one hope.

1175
01:00:05.893 --> 01:00:07.192
Chance...

1176
01:00:08.395 --> 01:00:10.362
open your heart.

1177
01:01:05.185 --> 01:01:08.219
Announcer: Welcome back
to "Dance or Bust,"


1178
01:01:08.221 --> 01:01:10.188
where former celebs...
- What is this?


1179
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:12.190
- Is that me?
- ...social media has-been...


1180
01:01:12.192 --> 01:01:14.576
What happens to me?

1181
01:01:14.577 --> 01:01:16.961
Karma, fate,
call it what you want.


1182
01:01:16.964 --> 01:01:19.130
Shane, what did you think
of today's performances?


1183
01:01:19.132 --> 01:01:22.100
Yeah, no, I know, Mom.
I wish I could be there, too,


1184
01:01:22.102 --> 01:01:25.971
but I'm just so swamped
with work right now.


1185
01:01:25.973 --> 01:01:28.273
Hi, Dad. Hi. Merry Christmas.

1186
01:01:28.275 --> 01:01:31.242
No, I know. I'm...I'm so sorry.
I really gotta go.


1187
01:01:31.244 --> 01:01:33.311
Okay, all right.
I love you. O-Okay, bye.


1188
01:01:33.313 --> 01:01:34.930
So sad.

1189
01:01:34.931 --> 01:01:36.548
Our judges have made
a final decision.


1190
01:01:39.386 --> 01:01:41.987
With the lowest score

1191
01:01:41.989 --> 01:01:45.023
recorded in the history
of "Dance or Bust,"


1192
01:01:45.025 --> 01:01:46.992
former teen pop icon
Chance Love


1193
01:01:46.994 --> 01:01:48.526
has officially been eliminated

1194
01:01:48.528 --> 01:01:50.996
in the first round
of the competition.


1195
01:01:50.998 --> 01:01:54.265
Seems like the judges
have been pretty harsh on her.


1196
01:01:54.267 --> 01:01:56.501
The judges?
Life's been harsh on her,


1197
01:01:56.503 --> 01:01:58.403
and it's not letting up
any time soon.


1198
01:01:58.405 --> 01:02:02.107
I do a celebrity
dance show? Aw, jeez.


1199
01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:03.441
Who are you to judge?

1200
01:02:03.443 --> 01:02:05.510
Not everyone does it
to pay their lawyer.


1201
01:02:05.512 --> 01:02:09.014
My lawyer?
What do I need a lawyer for?


1202
01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:12.550
There's a price
for living only for yourself,


1203
01:02:12.552 --> 01:02:14.552
and the bill comes due.

1204
01:02:18.758 --> 01:02:20.325
Thank you, guys,
so much for watching


1205
01:02:20.327 --> 01:02:22.660
and tuning in
to "Dance or Bust."


1206
01:02:28.635 --> 01:02:30.101
Yeah, uh...

1207
01:02:30.103 --> 01:02:31.436
- Chance Love?
- Yes.


1208
01:02:31.438 --> 01:02:33.104
I'm Agent Harris with the FBI.

1209
01:02:33.106 --> 01:02:34.472
You're under arrest
for tax evasion.


1210
01:02:34.474 --> 01:02:36.207
- Cuff her.
- What? This is ridiculous!


1211
01:02:36.209 --> 01:02:37.475
Miss, I need you
to turn around,


1212
01:02:37.477 --> 01:02:38.610
put your hands
behind your back.


1213
01:02:38.612 --> 01:02:39.978
Oh, my God!

1214
01:02:39.979 --> 01:02:41.345
There's no way that happens!

1215
01:02:41.348 --> 01:02:42.614
Oh, but it does.

1216
01:02:42.616 --> 01:02:44.082
...against you
in a court of law.


1217
01:02:44.084 --> 01:02:46.268
No! No! Get off of me!

1218
01:02:46.269 --> 01:02:48.453
- Stop resisting!
- No! Ow!


1219
01:02:48.455 --> 01:02:50.455
You understand these rights?

1220
01:02:50.457 --> 01:02:52.424
Yes, I do!
I freaking want an attorney.


1221
01:02:52.426 --> 01:02:55.093
Oh, I'm gonna lawyer up so hard,
and you're gonna be so screwed!


1222
01:02:55.095 --> 01:02:57.062
You have no idea!
I hope you like your job,


1223
01:02:57.064 --> 01:02:58.814
because you're gonna miss it!

1224
01:02:58.815 --> 01:03:00.565
Ow! I'm gonna wear your badge
like a belt buckle!


1225
01:03:00.567 --> 01:03:02.600
Officer: Get in!

1226
01:03:02.602 --> 01:03:04.636
You'll be sorry.
I'm Chance Love.


1227
01:03:04.638 --> 01:03:06.504
You have no idea
what you're doing!


1228
01:03:06.506 --> 01:03:08.239
Charming.

1229
01:03:08.241 --> 01:03:11.076
You can't treat me like this.

1230
01:03:11.078 --> 01:03:13.328
Ah, whatever.

1231
01:03:13.329 --> 01:03:15.579
Are you kidding me?
I get arrested on Christmas?


1232
01:03:15.582 --> 01:03:18.349
What kind of a horrible person
arrests someone on Christmas?


1233
01:03:18.351 --> 01:03:20.618
Aw, sweetie pie,

1234
01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:22.454
you ain't seen nothin' yet.

1235
01:03:22.456 --> 01:03:24.456
Let's go.

1236
01:03:35.335 --> 01:03:38.536
Let's take a trip
further down the rabbit hole.


1237
01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:43.141
Jail?

1238
01:03:43.143 --> 01:03:45.276
I'm in jail?

1239
01:03:45.278 --> 01:03:46.644
What's going on?

1240
01:03:46.646 --> 01:03:48.513
Okay, look.
Now I know you're lying,


1241
01:03:48.515 --> 01:03:50.648
because my lawyer
would never let me rot in jail.


1242
01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:52.417
You are so full of it.

1243
01:03:52.419 --> 01:03:56.321
You got 18 months.
Prison ain't no joke.


1244
01:03:56.323 --> 01:03:57.589
Toughens you up a little bit.

1245
01:03:57.591 --> 01:03:59.724
I've been in jail a year?

1246
01:03:59.726 --> 01:04:01.359
Mm-hmm.

1247
01:04:01.361 --> 01:04:04.129
I'm broke?

1248
01:04:04.131 --> 01:04:06.431
What? You're untouchable?

1249
01:04:06.433 --> 01:04:10.435
The rules don't apply
to the great Chance Love?


1250
01:04:10.437 --> 01:04:12.537
Turns out Uncle Sam
doesn't agree.


1251
01:04:12.539 --> 01:04:17.742
# 'Cause my only wish is #

1252
01:04:19.646 --> 01:04:24.249
# To go home for Christmas #

1253
01:04:26.936 --> 01:04:29.620
Prisoner 23582,
step back from the bars.


1254
01:04:32.459 --> 01:04:35.160
It's time
for your scheduled visitation.


1255
01:04:35.162 --> 01:04:36.461
Please step out.

1256
01:04:39.366 --> 01:04:40.431
- Are they...
- Walk!


1257
01:04:44.471 --> 01:04:46.404
Oh! He shoved me!

1258
01:04:46.406 --> 01:04:47.705
He can't shove me!

1259
01:04:47.707 --> 01:04:50.775
I am so tired of you.

1260
01:04:50.777 --> 01:04:53.278
Shut up. Open your eyes.

1261
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.713
Maybe you'll actually
learn something.


1262
01:05:04.724 --> 01:05:07.725
Well, who am I visiting with?

1263
01:05:11.398 --> 01:05:13.464
Thanks for all the help.

1264
01:05:16.403 --> 01:05:18.703
Ms. Love,
I'm sorry to inform you


1265
01:05:18.705 --> 01:05:20.572
that your visitors
were unable to make it.


1266
01:05:24.477 --> 01:05:26.311
Miss?

1267
01:05:26.313 --> 01:05:28.446
N-No, they said
they're coming.


1268
01:05:28.448 --> 01:05:30.365
Look, you're not
the only prisoner


1269
01:05:30.366 --> 01:05:32.283
whose family didn't show up.
Now please stand up.


1270
01:05:32.285 --> 01:05:34.752
They're gonna come, okay?

1271
01:05:35.755 --> 01:05:37.355
They're coming.

1272
01:05:39.292 --> 01:05:41.226
Miss, let's go.

1273
01:05:41.228 --> 01:05:42.660
No.

1274
01:05:42.662 --> 01:05:44.529
They're coming.

1275
01:05:44.531 --> 01:05:46.497
- Miss, come on.
- They're coming.


1276
01:05:46.499 --> 01:05:48.499
- Let's go.
- They're gonna come, okay?


1277
01:05:48.501 --> 01:05:49.767
They're coming.

1278
01:05:52.305 --> 01:05:55.440
I'm sure they
just got held up at the airport.


1279
01:05:55.442 --> 01:05:57.592
It's the holidays, so...

1280
01:05:57.593 --> 01:05:59.743
Yeah.
The holidays.


1281
01:05:59.746 --> 01:06:02.413
I'm sure
that's exactly what it is.


1282
01:06:39.286 --> 01:06:41.503
I guess I'd have to say

1283
01:06:41.504 --> 01:06:43.721
that this beautiful flower
is my inspiration.


1284
01:06:48.895 --> 01:06:50.595
Career gone.

1285
01:06:50.597 --> 01:06:52.563
Family gone.

1286
01:06:52.565 --> 01:06:55.466
Looks gone. Money gone.

1287
01:06:56.703 --> 01:06:57.835
You wither.

1288
01:06:59.572 --> 01:07:01.706
You never marry.

1289
01:07:01.708 --> 01:07:04.475
You never travel.
You never leave the house.


1290
01:07:11.751 --> 01:07:15.753
But this is
just a possible outcome


1291
01:07:15.755 --> 01:07:17.488
if everything goes
a certain way, right?


1292
01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:18.823
It's not definite.

1293
01:07:18.825 --> 01:07:20.892
You spiral.

1294
01:07:20.894 --> 01:07:24.529
You lie to family and friends.

1295
01:07:24.531 --> 01:07:26.564
You sit right there.

1296
01:07:27.734 --> 01:07:30.568
You watch
as the world forgets you.


1297
01:07:32.339 --> 01:07:33.738
Okay, I'm ready
to go back now.


1298
01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:35.473
Can you just please
take me back?


1299
01:07:35.475 --> 01:07:36.874
Mm-mmm.

1300
01:07:36.876 --> 01:07:39.010
One last stop.

1301
01:07:42.482 --> 01:07:44.382
All the furniture
is included if you want.


1302
01:07:44.384 --> 01:07:47.485
And this is
this fantastic master bedroom.


1303
01:07:47.487 --> 01:07:50.521
And right off to the side here
is the bathroom.


1304
01:07:50.523 --> 01:07:52.357
I like that tub.

1305
01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:54.459
If you guys
follow me right over here,


1306
01:07:54.461 --> 01:07:57.662
I'm excited to show you
this spacious backyard.


1307
01:07:58.631 --> 01:08:01.466
So I sell my house? Great.

1308
01:08:01.468 --> 01:08:03.401
You didn't sell it.

1309
01:08:03.403 --> 01:08:04.569
What do you mean?

1310
01:08:05.672 --> 01:08:06.971
The house's previous owner

1311
01:08:06.973 --> 01:08:10.408
was recording artist
Chance Love.


1312
01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:12.910
- Oh.
- Who...Who is that?


1313
01:08:12.912 --> 01:08:15.380
- Honey, he's in The Roots.
- Oh.


1314
01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:18.549
No. She did
one of those reality shows once.


1315
01:08:18.551 --> 01:08:19.951
It's a quite sad story,
actually.


1316
01:08:19.953 --> 01:08:21.753
Anyway, follow me this way.

1317
01:08:21.755 --> 01:08:24.389
I'm gonna show you this
fantastic, beautiful kitchen...


1318
01:08:24.391 --> 01:08:25.723
What's the sad story?

1319
01:08:26.926 --> 01:08:29.560
Be careful what you ask of me.

1320
01:08:29.562 --> 01:08:31.496
You cannot unsee your fate.

1321
01:08:31.498 --> 01:08:34.565
What happens to me?

1322
01:08:44.444 --> 01:08:45.443
Ms. Love?

1323
01:08:45.445 --> 01:08:46.844
Ms. Love, can you hear me?

1324
01:08:46.846 --> 01:08:49.414
Can you hear me?

1325
01:08:49.416 --> 01:08:51.549
The air bag did a number on her.

1326
01:08:51.551 --> 01:08:53.651
We need to clear her airway.
Get her head back.


1327
01:08:54.754 --> 01:08:56.554
What's happening?

1328
01:08:56.556 --> 01:09:00.057
The crash
threw you clear of your car.


1329
01:09:03.663 --> 01:09:05.313
She's shaking.

1330
01:09:05.314 --> 01:09:06.964
Hold her still.
I can't get the I.V. in.


1331
01:09:09.035 --> 01:09:10.101
Do I die?

1332
01:09:12.572 --> 01:09:13.704
Is this how I die?

1333
01:09:16.676 --> 01:09:17.809
I don't believe you.

1334
01:09:17.811 --> 01:09:19.644
You're liars!

1335
01:09:19.646 --> 01:09:21.546
I want to go home.

1336
01:09:21.548 --> 01:09:23.714
I want to go home right now.

1337
01:09:24.918 --> 01:09:27.118
Check
the other victim's pulse!


1338
01:09:28.488 --> 01:09:29.787
What other victim?

1339
01:09:35.528 --> 01:09:36.727
Brian?

1340
01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:38.729
What is he doing here?

1341
01:09:38.731 --> 01:09:40.731
He was in the passenger seat.

1342
01:09:41.768 --> 01:09:43.935
Never abandons you.

1343
01:09:43.937 --> 01:09:46.704
Sticks by your side
to the very end.


1344
01:09:46.706 --> 01:09:48.873
He doesn't die, okay?

1345
01:09:48.875 --> 01:09:51.008
He doesn't die.

1346
01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:53.878
Take me, okay?

1347
01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.013
Take me instead,
but he doesn't die!


1348
01:09:56.015 --> 01:09:58.015
Take me instead!

1349
01:09:58.017 --> 01:09:59.083
I'm sorry.

1350
01:09:59.085 --> 01:10:01.018
He's gone.

1351
01:10:01.020 --> 01:10:05.556
Time of death, 2:27.

1352
01:10:08.495 --> 01:10:12.063
He does not die.

1353
01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:15.500
He does not die.

1354
01:10:22.609 --> 01:10:24.041
I'm sorry.

1355
01:10:27.514 --> 01:10:28.546
Okay, let's get her going.

1356
01:10:28.548 --> 01:10:30.081
Okay, let's get her back.

1357
01:10:30.082 --> 01:10:31.615
- Let's get her back.
- Chance: Take me instead.


1358
01:10:31.618 --> 01:10:32.884
- Charging at 360!
- Take me.


1359
01:10:32.886 --> 01:10:35.786
Take me instead.

1360
01:10:36.756 --> 01:10:38.122
Charging.

1361
01:10:38.124 --> 01:10:39.924
Clear!

1362
01:10:39.926 --> 01:10:40.925
Shocking!

1363
01:10:40.927 --> 01:10:42.126
Chance: Don't die.

1364
01:10:45.832 --> 01:10:46.864
Take me instead.

1365
01:10:46.866 --> 01:10:48.099
Take me instead.

1366
01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:54.739
Please.

1367
01:10:54.741 --> 01:10:55.940
Please, no.

1368
01:10:55.942 --> 01:10:57.808
I'll change. I swear.

1369
01:10:57.810 --> 01:11:00.811
Please just give me
one more chance.


1370
01:11:00.813 --> 01:11:02.713
Hey! You all right?

1371
01:11:02.715 --> 01:11:03.814
We're here.

1372
01:11:03.816 --> 01:11:05.650
Sorry. Traffic was really bad.

1373
01:11:05.652 --> 01:11:07.084
Brian?

1374
01:11:08.021 --> 01:11:09.720
You're alive?!

1375
01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:12.857
Yeah, last I checked.

1376
01:11:15.094 --> 01:11:16.827
Thank you!

1377
01:11:18.565 --> 01:11:20.064
Wait! What...What day is it?

1378
01:11:20.066 --> 01:11:22.066
It's Christmas Eve.

1379
01:11:23.169 --> 01:11:26.737
Wow, that must have been
one heck of a nap.


1380
01:11:26.739 --> 01:11:29.106
Really? I didn't miss it?

1381
01:11:29.108 --> 01:11:31.809
No, you only been asleep,
like, less than an hour.


1382
01:11:31.811 --> 01:11:33.778
What?

1383
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:36.814
Thank you. Thank you.

1384
01:11:36.816 --> 01:11:38.399
You're welcome?

1385
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.983
H
-Hey, are you feeling okay?

1386
01:11:39.986 --> 01:11:42.920
I've never felt better
in my whole life!


1387
01:11:42.922 --> 01:11:45.122
Well, that's good.
That's amazing.


1388
01:11:45.124 --> 01:11:48.259
Wow, I'm so happy
how happy you are.


1389
01:11:49.162 --> 01:11:50.728
Hey, guess what?

1390
01:11:50.730 --> 01:11:52.029
While you were asleep,
Ron Grossman called.


1391
01:11:52.031 --> 01:11:54.231
He wants to set up
a phone meeting ASAP.


1392
01:11:56.936 --> 01:11:59.270
Can you come inside with me
for just five minutes?


1393
01:12:00.773 --> 01:12:02.907
- Sure.
- Okay.


1394
01:12:02.909 --> 01:12:05.843
Is that okay, if you
just wait for five minutes?


1395
01:12:05.845 --> 01:12:07.044
Fine with me.

1396
01:12:07.046 --> 01:12:09.914
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1397
01:12:10.984 --> 01:12:12.850
Hey, you sure
you don't want me


1398
01:12:12.852 --> 01:12:14.785
to get Roger on the phone again?

1399
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:18.155
No.

1400
01:12:18.157 --> 01:12:19.624
Come with me.

1401
01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:20.959
Okay.

1402
01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.293
All right.

1403
01:12:23.763 --> 01:12:25.730
What's going on? 
What you doing?

1404
01:12:25.732 --> 01:12:27.164
Okay. Oh, good, good, good!

1405
01:12:27.166 --> 01:12:28.633
I found them! Right.

1406
01:12:28.635 --> 01:12:30.768
What? What are they?

1407
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:32.336
Come on!

1408
01:12:32.337 --> 01:12:33.903
What...What are you up to?

1409
01:12:33.906 --> 01:12:35.973
Airplane ticket vouchers.

1410
01:12:35.975 --> 01:12:37.642
Okay. You going somewhere?

1411
01:12:37.644 --> 01:12:40.645
Uh-uh. We are.

1412
01:12:40.647 --> 01:12:41.712
We're going home.

1413
01:12:41.714 --> 01:12:43.648
Seriously?

1414
01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:44.982
Mm-hmm.

1415
01:12:44.984 --> 01:12:46.751
Come on.

1416
01:12:46.753 --> 01:12:47.885
You need a bag or something?

1417
01:12:50.890 --> 01:12:52.056
Jason?

1418
01:12:52.058 --> 01:12:54.058
What up, girl? Great news!

1419
01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.794
I got us the deal!
I talked to Grossman!


1420
01:12:56.796 --> 01:13:00.131
He wants us to produce
a duet album, media gold mine.


1421
01:13:00.133 --> 01:13:03.267
You will not believe the money!
Time to celebrate!


1422
01:13:03.269 --> 01:13:06.771
Seriously? A duet with you?

1423
01:13:06.773 --> 01:13:07.805
Heck, yeah.

1424
01:13:07.807 --> 01:13:09.140
Get on in.

1425
01:13:12.912 --> 01:13:14.745
Aw, Chance...

1426
01:13:19.952 --> 01:13:21.719
Jason...

1427
01:13:21.721 --> 01:13:23.220
this just isn't working out.

1428
01:13:30.763 --> 01:13:32.163
Are you sure?

1429
01:13:34.233 --> 01:13:35.332
Come on.

1430
01:13:37.103 --> 01:13:38.202
Babe?

1431
01:13:46.846 --> 01:13:48.245
You laughing at me?

1432
01:14:01.094 --> 01:14:03.127
I always hated that guy.

1433
01:14:03.129 --> 01:14:05.096
Airport, please.

1434
01:14:05.098 --> 01:14:06.831
You're the boss.

1435
01:14:06.833 --> 01:14:09.133
I can't believe
this is happening.


1436
01:14:11.037 --> 01:14:13.304
Cory? Hi. It's Chance.

1437
01:14:13.306 --> 01:14:16.073
Look, I am so sorry
for how I've acted with you,


1438
01:14:16.075 --> 01:14:18.142
and I know I've been
a slave-driving diva,


1439
01:14:18.144 --> 01:14:20.745
but I really need a favor.

1440
01:14:20.747 --> 01:14:24.949
I know it's really late
on Christmas Eve, but please.


1441
01:14:34.127 --> 01:14:35.126
Hello?

1442
01:14:35.128 --> 01:14:36.293
Hello. Merry Christmas!

1443
01:14:36.295 --> 01:14:38.162
Uh, oh. I'm sorry.

1444
01:14:38.164 --> 01:14:41.932
Can I help you? I'm sor...
What are you doing?


1445
01:14:45.071 --> 01:14:47.071
Look, I don't live here.
I'm just the sitter.


1446
01:14:47.073 --> 01:14:50.241
Actually, I'm looking for you.

1447
01:14:50.243 --> 01:14:51.976
Uh, for me?

1448
01:14:51.978 --> 01:14:55.012
I have no clue what you
said to her, but thank you.


1449
01:14:55.014 --> 01:14:56.914
Uh, to who?

1450
01:14:56.916 --> 01:14:58.883
Uh, these are all
for the little girl,


1451
01:14:58.885 --> 01:15:01.252
and we have one more that needs
to be special ordered.


1452
01:15:01.254 --> 01:15:02.920
I'm sorry.
I don't understand.


1453
01:15:02.922 --> 01:15:05.156
And this is for you.

1454
01:15:10.062 --> 01:15:12.196
My client instructed me
to give you this.


1455
01:15:12.198 --> 01:15:15.166
She's paying for your services
to this household.


1456
01:15:15.168 --> 01:15:16.834
A
-Are you kidding? I mean,

1457
01:15:16.836 --> 01:15:18.936
this is three times
what I make in a year.


1458
01:15:18.938 --> 01:15:21.071
Well, Merry Christmas!

1459
01:15:23.042 --> 01:15:25.276
Wait. Um...

1460
01:15:26.212 --> 01:15:27.278
Di...

1461
01:15:29.148 --> 01:15:30.981
Did anyone else see that?

1462
01:15:35.955 --> 01:15:37.488
Merry Christmas.

1463
01:15:39.959 --> 01:15:41.325
Mom? Dad?

1464
01:15:44.197 --> 01:15:45.362
Mom? Dad?

1465
01:15:45.364 --> 01:15:48.232
- Cherry Bear, hey!
- Hey!


1466
01:15:48.234 --> 01:15:49.800
Merry Christmas!

1467
01:15:49.801 --> 01:15:51.367
- Merry Christmas!
- Yeah!


1468
01:15:51.370 --> 01:15:53.370
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1469
01:15:53.372 --> 01:15:55.372
I love you guys so much!

1470
01:15:55.374 --> 01:15:58.142
I'm so sorry for how I've
treated you and how I've acted.


1471
01:15:58.144 --> 01:16:00.978
Aw, don't worry about it.
You're right on time.


1472
01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:03.180
- Are you gonna stay?
- Yeah.


1473
01:16:03.182 --> 01:16:05.349
We're gonna spend Christmas
as a family.


1474
01:16:05.351 --> 01:16:06.350
Ah, yes.

1475
01:16:06.352 --> 01:16:08.085
Okay. I have an idea,

1476
01:16:08.087 --> 01:16:09.987
and I need your guys' help.

1477
01:16:09.989 --> 01:16:12.389
It's gonna sound a little crazy.

1478
01:16:19.899 --> 01:16:23.000
Excuse me.
Uh, where Mrs. Barnes' room?


1479
01:16:23.002 --> 01:16:25.336
Are you friend or family?

1480
01:16:26.439 --> 01:16:28.305
I'm a friend.

1481
01:16:28.307 --> 01:16:30.107
Oh, you just missed
visiting hours.


1482
01:16:30.109 --> 01:16:32.409
It's, uh, family only.

1483
01:16:32.411 --> 01:16:33.444
Oh, my gosh.

1484
01:16:33.446 --> 01:16:35.145
You're Chance Love!

1485
01:16:35.147 --> 01:16:37.081
Yeah, in the flesh.

1486
01:16:37.083 --> 01:16:38.415
I follow you on Instagram.

1487
01:16:38.417 --> 01:16:41.952
That is so sweet. Thank you.

1488
01:16:41.954 --> 01:16:45.289
Look, I'm sorry.
A-Are you a paramedic?


1489
01:16:45.291 --> 01:16:47.157
Th-That's just so weird
that you would ask that.


1490
01:16:47.159 --> 01:16:48.893
I'm actually training
to become one,


1491
01:16:48.895 --> 01:16:52.296
hoping to move out west
and hop on an E.R. unit.


1492
01:16:52.298 --> 01:16:56.233
I have a feeling
you'll do really well.


1493
01:16:56.235 --> 01:16:57.935
Thanks.

1494
01:16:57.937 --> 01:16:59.570
Look, is there any way

1495
01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:01.204
that you could sneak me
into my friend's room?


1496
01:17:01.207 --> 01:17:03.140
I mean, it is Christmas.

1497
01:17:03.142 --> 01:17:07.278
Well, I'm not supposed to,

1498
01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:09.380
but I'm happy
to make an exception this time.


1499
01:17:09.382 --> 01:17:11.048
- I'll show you where.
- Great.


1500
01:17:11.050 --> 01:17:13.384
Oh, wait. Okay, um...

1501
01:17:13.386 --> 01:17:15.386
this is for the children's wing,

1502
01:17:15.388 --> 01:17:18.122
but don't tell anyone
who it's from.


1503
01:17:22.962 --> 01:17:24.495
You're an absolute angel.

1504
01:17:24.497 --> 01:17:27.064
Administration is gonna freak!

1505
01:17:27.066 --> 01:17:29.233
Okay, one more favor.

1506
01:17:29.235 --> 01:17:31.468
Uh, come here.

1507
01:17:33.239 --> 01:17:35.539
I just don't understand.

1508
01:17:35.541 --> 01:17:39.209
I thought you said
you couldn't come. I mean,


1509
01:17:39.211 --> 01:17:43.948
we're so happy that you're here,
but what about your job?


1510
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:46.984
Yeah, Mom,
I can stay as long as I need to,


1511
01:17:46.986 --> 01:17:49.486
paid, and she gave me a raise.

1512
01:17:49.488 --> 01:17:51.956
Oh, my...

1513
01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:54.158
What a wonderful girl.

1514
01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.226
Well, I'll be.

1515
01:17:56.228 --> 01:18:00.197
It looks like I'm gonna have
to get you a pig to kiss, son!


1516
01:18:02.335 --> 01:18:04.501
You know, he's right.
I did promise,


1517
01:18:04.503 --> 01:18:06.437
so, yeah, you go ahead,
and find that pig,


1518
01:18:06.439 --> 01:18:08.973
'cause I will kiss it!

1519
01:18:08.975 --> 01:18:10.174
Am I interrupting?

1520
01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:16.981
Chance?

1521
01:18:16.983 --> 01:18:18.816
What are you doing here?

1522
01:18:18.817 --> 01:18:20.650
Brian, I asked,
am I interrupting?


1523
01:18:25.391 --> 01:18:27.391
No, I don't believe you are.

1524
01:18:27.393 --> 01:18:29.493
Great. Come on in, guys!

1525
01:18:29.495 --> 01:18:31.195
Let's go.

1526
01:18:31.197 --> 01:18:33.130
Hey, all right.

1527
01:18:33.132 --> 01:18:34.264
Merry Christmas!

1528
01:18:34.266 --> 01:18:36.000
Yeah, Merry Christmas!

1529
01:18:36.002 --> 01:18:38.002
Brian: Thank you!
You guys shouldn't have.


1530
01:18:38.004 --> 01:18:40.270
Wait.

1531
01:18:40.272 --> 01:18:45.376
Chance, I can't
believe you did all this.


1532
01:18:45.378 --> 01:18:47.344
Well, you've done
so much for me,


1533
01:18:47.346 --> 01:18:49.413
and I've never even
said thank you,


1534
01:18:49.415 --> 01:18:53.017
so I just wanted to show you
how much you mean to me.


1535
01:18:53.019 --> 01:18:55.419
Well, it's incredible.

1536
01:18:55.421 --> 01:18:57.054
Thank you so much.

1537
01:18:57.056 --> 01:18:59.356
I donated all of the proceeds
from the single


1538
01:18:59.358 --> 01:19:01.058
to the children's wing,

1539
01:19:01.060 --> 01:19:04.695
and all of your mom's bills
are paid for.


1540
01:19:09.602 --> 01:19:11.101
Thank you.

1541
01:19:15.508 --> 01:19:19.109
Thank you. You are amazing.

1542
01:19:37.229 --> 01:19:39.430
Becca! Come here!

1543
01:19:39.432 --> 01:19:40.464
Yes, Katherine?

1544
01:19:40.466 --> 01:19:43.467
Come here. Hurry.

1545
01:19:43.469 --> 01:19:45.469
Look!

1546
01:19:49.241 --> 01:19:51.475
Who brought them?

1547
01:19:51.477 --> 01:19:53.343
I think an angel.

1548
01:19:56.182 --> 01:20:01.452
# I remember
how just last December #


1549
01:20:01.454 --> 01:20:07.658
# We were here together
in the cold #


1550
01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:13.497
# Snow was falling,
and I heard you calling me #


1551
01:20:13.499 --> 01:20:19.336
# To meet you by the mistletoe #

1552
01:20:19.338 --> 01:20:22.239
# And you held
me by the fire #

1553
01:20:22.241 --> 01:20:25.375
# With the lights
all on the tree #


1554
01:20:25.377 --> 01:20:28.412
# When everything was perfect #

1555
01:20:28.414 --> 01:20:31.348
# Just you and me #

1556
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:35.586
# I don't need no presents #

1557
01:20:35.588 --> 01:20:42.626
# 'Cause my only wish is
that you're home for Christmas #


1558
01:20:42.628 --> 01:20:47.431
# Counting down the seconds #

1559
01:20:47.433 --> 01:20:51.301
# 'Cause I need your kisses #

1560
01:20:51.303 --> 01:20:55.272
# So come home
for Christmas to me #


1561
01:21:06.318 --> 01:21:11.421
# Our favorite carols
and the sound of sleigh bells #


1562
01:21:11.423 --> 01:21:18.262
# Ringing through the city
and the night #


1563
01:21:18.264 --> 01:21:21.165
# Fingers frozen... #

1564
01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:22.566
We did all right, huh?

1565
01:21:23.536 --> 01:21:26.170
Yeah, we did.

1566
01:21:26.172 --> 01:21:27.471
Not too shabby.

1567
01:21:27.473 --> 01:21:29.306
Hmm.

1568
01:21:29.308 --> 01:21:31.175
# And you held me
by the fire... #


1569
01:21:31.177 --> 01:21:32.442
I could go for Chinese.

1570
01:21:32.444 --> 01:21:35.445
Mmm. I could eat.

1571
01:21:35.447 --> 01:21:37.414
Sure, but no fusion.

1572
01:21:37.416 --> 01:21:39.283
Ooh. No. No, no, no.

1573
01:21:41.687 --> 01:21:43.587
Pickles a condiment?

1574
01:21:43.589 --> 01:21:46.523
Mm, as a purist, I'd say no.

1575
01:21:46.525 --> 01:21:47.791
You know, to me,
it's the ketchups,


1576
01:21:47.793 --> 01:21:49.726
it's the mayos,
it's the relishes.


1577
01:21:49.728 --> 01:21:51.595
- Then again...
- Technically, relish is...


1578
01:21:51.597 --> 01:21:53.597
Exactly. It's just
chopped up pickles, so...


1579
01:21:53.599 --> 01:21:57.668
# Counting down the seconds #

1580
01:21:57.670 --> 01:22:01.438
# 'Cause I need your kisses #

1581
01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:06.543
# So come home
for Christmas to me #


1582
01:22:11.717 --> 01:22:13.217
No! I thought we were
done with all of this!


1583
01:22:13.219 --> 01:22:15.286
I learned my lesson! I swear!

1584
01:22:15.287 --> 01:22:17.354
I just have
one more thing to show you.


1585
01:22:17.356 --> 01:22:18.622
You'll like this.

1586
01:22:21.227 --> 01:22:23.794
Becca, look!

1587
01:22:23.796 --> 01:22:26.630
It's for you!

1588
01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.533
Oh, she got it.

1589
01:22:29.535 --> 01:22:30.734
I hope she likes it.

1590
01:22:30.736 --> 01:22:32.769
Just watch.

1591
01:22:35.507 --> 01:22:36.907
Oh, my...

1592
01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:45.349
Oh, my God.
