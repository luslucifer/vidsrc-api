1
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.401
Ruth.

2
00:00:48.397 --> 00:00:49.772
Hey, Ruth.

3
00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:52.849
Where are you going?
Home.


4
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:54.651
Home's the other way.
Not mine.


5
00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:57.387
Are you going back
to your mom's?


6
00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:01.291
It's a 15-mile walk.
I know how far it is.


7
00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:03.193
All right. Well, then,
I'll just walk with you.


8
00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:05.328
You do whatever you want.
What I want to do is take you


9
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.996
back to our house.
Why did you tell Freddy you


10
00:01:06.998 --> 00:01:08.932
were gonna strike out
on your own?


11
00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:11.868
I don't think I said that, but

12
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.672
if I did, when I say, "on my
own," I mean you and me.


13
00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:18.375
I always mean you and me.

14
00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:19.485
Hey.

15
00:01:22.893 --> 00:01:24.572
You gonna leave me?

16
00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.117
No, I'm not gonna leave you.
Nobody's leaving any...


17
00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.286
'cause I will leave you first.

18
00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:33.891
It's not... Funny.

19
00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:39.563
I'm not gonna leave you.
You're not gonna leave me.


20
00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.857
Because if you do, I'll just
follow you.


21
00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:51.442
I don't want to go to jail.
Not going to jail.


22
00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:56.122
And that shack ain't a home.
Well, I'm working on it.


23
00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:05.793
And I think I'm gonna have a baby.

24
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:22.805
We're gonna have a baby?

25
00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:31.416
You're not mad? I'm not mad.

26
00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:35.053
No, my mama will raise it.

27
00:02:35.055 --> 00:02:37.989
â™ª Can I steal a kiss?

28
00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:46.031
Stop it. That tickles.
That's what you're supposed


29
00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:49.534
to do, is sing songs.
Just talk.


30
00:02:56.591 --> 00:02:58.336
Are you tired?

31
00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:18.916
Bluebird, bluebird.

32
00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.859
All right.

33
00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:45.157
I'll be fine.

34
00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:51.187
I'll be back in five minutes.

35
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:17.155
We've got a little bit of a

36
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.159
chase on our hands here...
I tell you, walking into


37
00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:21.094
there, you feel like you're
meeting the devil.


38
00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:24.431
All cars for backup.
I repeat, all cars, all cars...


39
00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:27.300
any and all cars.
Shit. All right. Check, hon.


40
00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:39.965
Ugh!

41
00:04:47.156 --> 00:04:50.791
Ugh!

42
00:04:50.793 --> 00:04:54.194
I'm hit! I shot someone.

43
00:04:54.196 --> 00:04:59.199
I think I shot someone.

44
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:02.803
It's okay.

45
00:05:02.805 --> 00:05:06.908
Oh, my God.

46
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.712
Hey. Hey.

47
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:30.313
I think I shot someone.
Oh, shit.


48
00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:38.139
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Ruth.


49
00:05:42.612 --> 00:05:44.846
What are you doing?
Listen to me.


50
00:05:44.848 --> 00:05:47.281
We're gonna stand up and walk
out there.


51
00:05:47.283 --> 00:05:48.950
No. Okay. I'm gonna go first.

52
00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:51.786
You come after me.
That's how it's gonna be.


53
00:05:51.788 --> 00:05:55.223
No. We can make it.
We can make it if we run.


54
00:05:55.225 --> 00:05:58.192
We can't make it, Ruth.
Yeah, we can.


55
00:05:58.194 --> 00:05:59.927
They're gonna shoot us.
If we stay in here,


56
00:05:59.929 --> 00:06:01.496
they're gonna shoot us
right where we are.


57
00:06:01.498 --> 00:06:02.330
No. Please.

58
00:06:02.332 --> 00:06:03.665
I'm gonna do it.

59
00:06:03.667 --> 00:06:05.434
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not going to jail!


60
00:06:05.436 --> 00:06:07.237
Shh. You got to tell them I
did everything.


61
00:06:07.238 --> 00:06:08.971
Tell them that me and Freddy did
everything.


62
00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:11.173
You got a gun in your hands
'cause I put it there.


63
00:06:11.175 --> 00:06:13.342
You tell them you were scared
and I put it there.


64
00:06:13.344 --> 00:06:15.177
I'm gonna be out in a blink, and
I'm gonna come back.


65
00:06:15.179 --> 00:06:17.179
All you got to
do is wait for me.

66
00:06:17.181 --> 00:06:21.884
I promise I'll come get you.
Just wait for me, okay?


67
00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:23.886
Just wait for me.

68
00:07:28.947 --> 00:07:34.099
So, I lost my boy.
And that leaves you...


69
00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:39.354
And Bob.
Only Bob don't got a choice.


70
00:07:40.804 --> 00:07:45.567
I'm confused, Ruth.
I took you kids in...


71
00:07:46.934 --> 00:07:49.860
raised you and Bob
like you were my own.


72
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.273
How do you go and
do a thing like this?


73
00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:58.523
We were just doing
what you taught us to do.


74
00:08:01.625 --> 00:08:03.766
Is that a boy or a girl?

75
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.213
Do you know yet?
I don't know.


76
00:08:11.597 --> 00:08:16.333
So, what do you want to do,
Ruth?


77
00:08:16.335 --> 00:08:18.512
I'm gonna wait for him.

78
00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.673
Dear Ruth...

79
00:08:23.743 --> 00:08:26.810
I dreamed about you again last night.

80
00:08:26.812 --> 00:08:32.583
I guess I dream about you every
night... and most days, too.


81
00:08:32.585 --> 00:08:36.787
I hold your face in my mind.
I put your voice together in my


82
00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:39.323
head. I think about your hair

83
00:08:39.325 --> 00:08:41.759
getting longer.
I think about your belly


84
00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:45.362
getting bigger.
I hear people talk about regret,


85
00:08:45.364 --> 00:08:48.999
but I haven't got any.
I don't think poorly on the


86
00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:53.070
things I've done.
We did what we did, and that is


87
00:08:53.072 --> 00:08:55.539
who we are.
They're gonna cross out this


88
00:08:55.541 --> 00:08:58.343
sentence before you get to read it,
but I know you know what it


89
00:08:58.345 --> 00:09:01.413
says.
Every day, I wake up thinking


90
00:09:01.415 --> 00:09:04.916
today's the day I'm gonna see
you, and one of these days, it


91
00:09:04.918 --> 00:09:07.419
will be so.
And until then, I'll keep


92
00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:10.121
writing you.
I'll write you every day.


93
00:09:10.123 --> 00:09:13.625
And someday you'll get a letter
from me, and you will look up,


94
00:09:13.627 --> 00:09:17.495
and it'll be me who's handing it
to you.


95
00:09:17.497 --> 00:09:20.165
And then we can forget about
words, and I'll touch your face


96
00:09:20.167 --> 00:09:23.401
and I'll kiss you.

97
00:09:43.739 --> 00:09:45.651
Bob Muldoon, are you awake?

98
00:09:46.493 --> 00:09:49.761
Yeah. You got a baby girl.

99
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.885
And I'll take our baby girl
in my arms...


100
00:10:14.589 --> 00:10:20.559
And we will ride off to somewhere...
somewhere far away.


101
00:10:23.237 --> 00:10:24.728
Hey.

102
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.501
Write to me soon, any chance
you get.


103
00:10:39.113 --> 00:10:41.113
Love, Bob.

104
00:10:55.431 --> 00:10:56.315
Mommy. Mommy.

105
00:11:30.499 --> 00:11:35.702
Mommy. Mommy.

106
00:11:35.704 --> 00:11:38.271
Mornin'. Mommy.

107
00:11:38.273 --> 00:11:41.274
How'd you sleep? Good.

108
00:11:41.276 --> 00:11:45.112
You hungry? No.

109
00:11:45.114 --> 00:11:48.048
What's up? Come here.

110
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:53.942
Let's go back to sleep.

111
00:13:24.182 --> 00:13:28.370
Mommy! Look what I found!

112
00:13:28.819 --> 00:13:32.120
What'd you find? Kitties!

113
00:13:32.122 --> 00:13:34.923
Where did these come from?
I don't know.


114
00:13:34.925 --> 00:13:37.392
How many are you?

115
00:13:37.394 --> 00:13:41.630
You're just a tiny little thing.
Aren't you tiny?


116
00:13:41.632 --> 00:13:44.700
Where's your mama at?

117
00:13:44.702 --> 00:13:46.735
What are you crying for? Huh?

118
00:13:46.737 --> 00:13:50.073
Maybe he wants me. What?

119
00:13:50.075 --> 00:13:53.710
Maybe he wants me.
Maybe he does.


120
00:13:53.712 --> 00:13:56.379
But you still have two more bites.

121
00:13:56.381 --> 00:13:59.449
"And the little horse ran and"

122
00:13:59.451 --> 00:14:03.319
ran, and foxes chased him, and
he could hear them barking.


123
00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:07.123
And the wolves ran after him,
and he could hear them howling,


124
00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:09.459
"but he knew they couldn't catch him."

125
00:14:09.461 --> 00:14:12.362
Bear.
Yeah, there's that baby bear.


126
00:14:12.364 --> 00:14:14.864
Your daddy loves bears.
He used to wrestle with them.


127
00:14:14.866 --> 00:14:18.001
He'd tackle them down.
He'd bop them on the nose.


128
00:14:50.918 --> 00:14:52.832
Sylvie, put your shoes on.

129
00:14:53.387 --> 00:14:54.762
Okay.

130
00:15:02.286 --> 00:15:04.217
Hey. Morning, miss Guthrie.

131
00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.594
I was hoping to catch you
before work.


132
00:15:06.919 --> 00:15:10.054
Is something wrong?
I was hoping for a word.


133
00:15:10.056 --> 00:15:12.523
How many cats you got? Four.

134
00:15:12.525 --> 00:15:16.493
Yeah? What's this one's name?
Willow.


135
00:15:16.495 --> 00:15:21.498
He looks like a Jimmy to me.

136
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.536
How'd you get those cats?

137
00:15:25.538 --> 00:15:28.405
Get down. Found them out back.

138
00:15:28.407 --> 00:15:32.309
Oh, thank you.
Mama was long gone, I guess.


139
00:15:32.311 --> 00:15:35.979
Well, you need someone to
take a few of them off your


140
00:15:35.981 --> 00:15:37.815
hands?
I can handle some kittens, at


141
00:15:37.817 --> 00:15:41.785
least.

142
00:15:44.521 --> 00:15:48.661
Like I said, uh...
They're setting to get ready to


143
00:15:48.696 --> 00:15:54.432
call you down to the station,
and, uh, it's gonna be all over


144
00:15:54.434 --> 00:15:58.136
the news later.
Thought best if you hear this


145
00:15:58.138 --> 00:16:02.307
from a friend. Hear what?

146
00:16:14.338 --> 00:16:17.309
Bob tried to escape five
times already.


147
00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:22.494
Did you know that? No, sir.

148
00:16:22.496 --> 00:16:25.196
Well, maybe six times is the charm.

149
00:16:25.198 --> 00:16:29.334
The boys he broke free with got
caught trying to hop a train up


150
00:16:29.336 --> 00:16:31.946
near bartlesville, heading north.

151
00:16:33.907 --> 00:16:36.372
Maybe Bob's doing likewise.

152
00:16:38.501 --> 00:16:41.315
Maybe he's already long gone.

153
00:16:41.615 --> 00:16:45.184
Maybe. What do you think?

154
00:16:45.186 --> 00:16:49.989
I don't know.
Anybody asking about him...


155
00:16:49.991 --> 00:16:54.427
anybody at all? Nope.

156
00:16:54.429 --> 00:16:59.632
What about those letters?
Everyone read them before


157
00:16:59.634 --> 00:17:03.068
they even got sent.
They don't say anything.


158
00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:06.138
You want to just bring them
in anyway?


159
00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.276
I'll do whatever you want,
but he won't come back.


160
00:17:10.278 --> 00:17:14.513
He's not coming back for me if
that's what you're thinking.


161
00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:25.507
Ruth!

162
00:17:34.973 --> 00:17:39.564
Did she tell you anything?
Did she tell you anything?


163
00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.142
No, gene.
She didn't say a damn thing.


164
00:17:42.144 --> 00:17:45.011
I'm surprised.
I thought she'd like you better


165
00:17:45.013 --> 00:17:48.515
than me.
Let me have this one, huh?


166
00:17:48.517 --> 00:17:50.617
Well, hell, pat.
You're the one he shot.


167
00:17:50.619 --> 00:17:52.886
I'm gonna let you catch the son
of a bitch.


168
00:17:52.888 --> 00:17:56.122
Yep. Sorry I'm late.

169
00:17:56.124 --> 00:17:59.526
She had to have a time-out.
She got in a fight with Miles.


170
00:17:59.528 --> 00:18:02.929
Why did you get into a fight
with those boys?


171
00:18:02.931 --> 00:18:05.999
They called me names.
You need to have a better


172
00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:08.001
reason than that.

173
00:18:15.203 --> 00:18:19.069
Come on. Upsy
-Daisy. Oy.

174
00:18:19.248 --> 00:18:19.792
Evening.

175
00:18:24.486 --> 00:18:28.188
Hi. Hey, little girl.

176
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:32.425
Hi.
Don't you look pretty today?


177
00:18:32.427 --> 00:18:35.061
You got a birthday coming up,
don't you?


178
00:18:35.063 --> 00:18:39.299
Well, you got your birthday list
put together yet?


179
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.455
You better get on that.
Get your mama to help you.


180
00:18:46.743 --> 00:18:52.446
I heard the news.
Anything you want to talk about?


181
00:18:52.448 --> 00:18:55.416
Everyone thinks I got
something to tell them.


182
00:18:56.104 --> 00:18:57.966
I don't have a goddamn thing.

183
00:19:00.356 --> 00:19:02.978
They say they traced
him to Montana.


184
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.768
You think he's in Montana?

185
00:19:10.253 --> 00:19:14.089
I can make some phone calls,
see what I can do about putting


186
00:19:14.771 --> 00:19:17.471
an end to all this.
I could put an end to all


187
00:19:17.931 --> 00:19:21.746
this right now all by myself.
All I'd have to do is...


188
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.447
Tell the truth.

189
00:19:39.156 --> 00:19:43.475
â™ª Hey, little blue Jay,
sing me a song â™ª


190
00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:48.770
â™ª About Santa Ana at the
San Anton' â™ª


191
00:19:48.772 --> 00:19:53.709
â™ª Hey, blue Jay, can I steal
a kiss â™ª


192
00:19:53.711 --> 00:19:59.514
â™ª Like they tried to steal a
Cannon from Gonzales? â™ª


193
00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:06.257
â™ª Bluebird, whistle Waterloo
â™ª will you come to the bower


194
00:20:06.667 --> 00:20:09.376
I've shaded for you? â™ª

195
00:20:09.867 --> 00:20:14.481
â™ª Hey, little blue Jay,
sing me a tune â™ª


196
00:20:15.133 --> 00:20:20.070
â™ª Down way in Mexico,
back in June â™ª


197
00:21:10.829 --> 00:21:12.368
Excuse me, ma'am.

198
00:21:12.837 --> 00:21:13.781
Ma'am?

199
00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:22.720
Keep driving and stick to the
highway.


200
00:21:24.436 --> 00:21:26.569
Where are we, anyway? What?

201
00:21:26.571 --> 00:21:30.139
Where are we?
What state are we in?


202
00:21:30.141 --> 00:21:33.811
Missouri.
Oh, Missouri?


203
00:21:39.553 --> 00:21:41.622
I recognize you.

204
00:23:10.304 --> 00:23:12.413
Hey, how do you turn it up?

205
00:23:12.448 --> 00:23:13.978
On the side, there's a
little, uh...


206
00:23:13.980 --> 00:23:17.515
Yeah, that's it.

207
00:23:18.452 --> 00:23:23.123
â™ª And lonely nights, I think
of people that I miss â™ª


208
00:23:24.624 --> 00:23:30.296
â™ª And every day, I think of
others you might miss â™ª


209
00:23:30.732 --> 00:23:32.253
Where you planning on going?

210
00:23:32.792 --> 00:23:35.950
A direction that hasn't been invented yet.
â™ª... The sound of...


211
00:23:36.372 --> 00:23:39.872
I don't know.
â™ª I could never forget about


212
00:23:39.874 --> 00:23:44.910
you â™ª
â™ª the good times and the bad


213
00:23:44.912 --> 00:23:47.780
so, uh...

214
00:23:47.782 --> 00:23:51.350
How'd you do it?
Do what... get out?


215
00:23:51.352 --> 00:23:54.553
Yeah. Is this how fellas are

216
00:23:54.555 --> 00:23:59.658
wearing their hair?

217
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:05.064
Well, man, I just started
walking, you know... just like I


218
00:24:05.066 --> 00:24:10.836
said I would.

219
00:24:14.378 --> 00:24:15.741
And just walked out?

220
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:18.392
Yep.

221
00:24:20.414 --> 00:24:24.049
How's that work?
Well, you know, the guards...


222
00:24:24.051 --> 00:24:28.087
they come by your cell every night...

223
00:24:28.089 --> 00:24:32.092
Sort of saying, "lights out" and
rattling bars with their sticks.


224
00:24:32.094 --> 00:24:34.594
And this one guard... he used to
always joke and carry on with


225
00:24:34.596 --> 00:24:39.065
us.
And one night I said, "well, I"


226
00:24:39.067 --> 00:24:43.703
won't be seeing you much longer.
I figure I'll be out of here in


227
00:24:43.705 --> 00:24:47.040
about 10 days."
He said, "how you gonna do it?"


228
00:24:47.042 --> 00:24:50.610
I said, "I'm gonna just walk
right out the door."


229
00:24:50.612 --> 00:24:53.980
And he said they'd stop me.
And I said, "no, sir."


230
00:24:53.982 --> 00:24:58.084
I've got better things to do."
And he said, "well, that's not


231
00:24:58.086 --> 00:25:01.054
how it works."
And I said, "well, it only works


232
00:25:01.056 --> 00:25:03.490
that way 'cause you think it has to.

233
00:25:03.492 --> 00:25:07.627
See, I've got a higher calling.
I've got a wife and a little


234
00:25:07.629 --> 00:25:13.099
girl who needs her daddy."
And he asked me what I know


235
00:25:13.101 --> 00:25:15.535
about higher callings... says
even if I do get out, I'm gonna


236
00:25:15.537 --> 00:25:20.540
have to answer to God and the
devil for the things I done.


237
00:25:20.542 --> 00:25:26.411
I tell him... Shoot.
I tell him...


238
00:25:30.258 --> 00:25:32.200
I tell him, "sir..."

239
00:25:32.986 --> 00:25:38.426
I used to be the devil.
Now I'm just a man."


240
00:25:38.428 --> 00:25:43.597
As the days tick by...

241
00:25:43.599 --> 00:25:45.622
and on the last day...

242
00:25:48.413 --> 00:25:53.085
The bars open up,
and I walk right out.


243
00:25:55.702 --> 00:25:58.128
News says you jumped
off a work truck.


244
00:26:01.291 --> 00:26:02.931
Yeah.

245
00:26:06.266 --> 00:26:07.897
Well...

246
00:26:20.151 --> 00:26:22.575
Man, have you got anything to eat?

247
00:26:23.072 --> 00:26:27.209
I'm still a little bit hungry.

248
00:26:27.211 --> 00:26:32.781
Well, I'll find something.

249
00:26:32.783 --> 00:26:37.628
Have you seen Ruth lately?
Nope. It's been a while.


250
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:45.494
She don't live with her
mama no more.


251
00:26:45.496 --> 00:26:49.664
Got a new house. A new house?

252
00:26:49.666 --> 00:26:53.235
Mm-hmm. Skerritt's been
looking after her.


253
00:26:53.237 --> 00:26:57.105
He got her all set up.
Guess I should tell you got a


254
00:26:57.107 --> 00:27:00.642
call the other day asking about you.

255
00:27:00.644 --> 00:27:02.811
Oh, yeah? What'd you tell 'em?

256
00:27:02.813 --> 00:27:06.481
I told them I hadn't seen
you, which I hadn't.


257
00:27:07.313 --> 00:27:09.627
Didn't think I'd be
seeing you so soon.


258
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:11.850
That's the truth.

259
00:29:47.519 --> 00:29:51.040
I guess that's about... that's
about what I owe you.


260
00:29:54.421 --> 00:29:57.689
Where'd this come from?

261
00:29:57.691 --> 00:30:02.427
All over. Whose is it?

262
00:30:02.429 --> 00:30:05.663
It's mine.

263
00:30:11.671 --> 00:30:16.674
Sounds like that wood's gone soft.

264
00:30:16.676 --> 00:30:20.846
Yeah, I expect you're right.
More nails just won't hold it.


265
00:30:20.848 --> 00:30:23.649
The whole gutter just comes off
the house every time it rains


266
00:30:23.651 --> 00:30:25.417
like this.
You know, I go out there and


267
00:30:25.419 --> 00:30:27.486
nail it back up.
Next thing you know, it's back


268
00:30:27.488 --> 00:30:29.455
off.
Well, you can either do that


269
00:30:29.457 --> 00:30:31.457
or get more buckets.

270
00:30:31.459 --> 00:30:34.293
Yeah, I could do that.
That'd be easier in the


271
00:30:34.295 --> 00:30:36.662
short-term, for sure.
Then I'd have to haul that water


272
00:30:36.664 --> 00:30:38.430
out every time it rains.
I don't know.


273
00:30:38.432 --> 00:30:40.766
Howdy! Howdy to you.

274
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.738
Yeah, all this rain we've
been having reminds me of that


275
00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.908
one march, it was.
We'd get 101/2 inches in a day.


276
00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:53.312
Man.
Oh, my middle tank out there has


277
00:30:53.314 --> 00:30:55.648
gone dry, and the other two...
say, can you tell me just


278
00:30:55.650 --> 00:31:00.119
what town we're in, exactly?
This is meridian.


279
00:31:00.121 --> 00:31:03.689
Okay. See, we passed through

280
00:31:03.691 --> 00:31:06.458
Glen rose, but we didn't see a
sign... didn't know if we'd gone


281
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.795
too far, not far enough.
Well, that depends on where


282
00:31:09.797 --> 00:31:14.099
you're headed.
We're headed here.


283
00:31:14.101 --> 00:31:17.470
You, uh, plan to hunt some
deer?


284
00:31:17.472 --> 00:31:21.174
Thinking about it.
Anyway, it rained so much, it


285
00:31:21.176 --> 00:31:23.510
filled up them tanks, and my
wife walked up there to check


286
00:31:23.512 --> 00:31:25.945
'em the next day, and there was
catfish lyin' there.


287
00:31:25.947 --> 00:31:28.715
That thing filled up, and it was
spillin', and it had come out in


288
00:31:28.717 --> 00:31:29.949
the spill.

289
00:31:29.951 --> 00:31:32.452
Are these real? Come again?

290
00:31:32.454 --> 00:31:37.290
Are these real? You bet.

291
00:31:37.292 --> 00:31:41.895
How old are they?
Well, that pistol goes back


292
00:31:41.897 --> 00:31:45.532
125 years. You don't say.

293
00:31:45.534 --> 00:31:49.769
See that scrap of paper there

294
00:31:49.771 --> 00:31:53.206
next to it?

295
00:31:53.208 --> 00:31:58.878
That there is a list...
Of every poor son of a bitch who


296
00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:04.184
met his end at the barrel of it.

297
00:32:04.186 --> 00:32:06.342
Sounds like a bunch of
bullshit to me.


298
00:32:07.138 --> 00:32:09.260
Yeah, probably is.

299
00:32:12.025 --> 00:32:15.041
Can I help you gentlemen
find something in particular?


300
00:32:15.076 --> 00:32:19.533
Nah. Just looking around.

301
00:32:34.109 --> 00:32:35.866
Is there any news?

302
00:32:36.819 --> 00:32:39.854
No, not today. Uh...

303
00:32:40.404 --> 00:32:45.379
Figured you want these back.
They're just gathering dust.


304
00:32:48.865 --> 00:32:51.932
You read 'em? No, ma'am.

305
00:32:51.934 --> 00:32:55.202
Why not? Everyone else has.

306
00:32:55.204 --> 00:32:58.305
They're not mine to read.

307
00:33:07.005 --> 00:33:10.712
Can I ask you something?
Mm, sure.


308
00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:14.389
Do you mean what you said
about Bob not coming back for


309
00:33:14.391 --> 00:33:20.328
you? Yeah, I did.

310
00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:24.032
Well, I was thinking maybe
you all'd want to get out of


311
00:33:24.034 --> 00:33:29.838
town until all this blows over.
You mean till he gets caught?


312
00:33:30.825 --> 00:33:34.612
Where would we go?
Someplace safe.


313
00:33:37.398 --> 00:33:39.254
Would you come?

314
00:33:41.057 --> 00:33:43.189
Someone would come with you.

315
00:33:48.938 --> 00:33:51.876
I think I'll just stay here.
You know, I got to work, and


316
00:33:52.429 --> 00:33:55.497
Sylvie's got her birthday.
We'll be just fine.


317
00:33:55.499 --> 00:33:57.933
Yeah, sure. She's gonna be 4.

318
00:33:57.935 --> 00:33:59.868
Is that right? Yep.

319
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:03.972
Yeah. What's she want?

320
00:34:03.974 --> 00:34:06.942
She wants a horse.
Like, a real horse?


321
00:34:06.944 --> 00:34:11.981
Yep. Yeah?

322
00:34:11.983 --> 00:34:15.251
Where you gonna put it?

323
00:34:15.253 --> 00:34:17.520
You know what?
I know a man who... who could


324
00:34:17.522 --> 00:34:19.622
sell you one for... for not a
bad price.


325
00:34:19.624 --> 00:34:21.290
You do? I do.

326
00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:26.462
I can't take care of no horse.

327
00:34:26.464 --> 00:34:31.200
Well... No horse.
Maybe I could, uh... maybe I


328
00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:34.470
could bring her something. Why?

329
00:34:34.472 --> 00:34:38.908
Well, I was just doing some
cleaning, and...


330
00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:42.245
I... I may have a few deals just
floating around that maybe,


331
00:34:42.247 --> 00:34:43.813
uh... maybe she'd take to,
you know?


332
00:34:43.815 --> 00:34:45.715
Just... A few deals, huh?

333
00:34:45.717 --> 00:34:47.116
A few deals.

334
00:34:54.352 --> 00:34:56.019
Dear Ruth...

335
00:34:57.834 --> 00:35:00.395
I don't know how
to start this letter.


336
00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:01.998
I have got a million things on

337
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.433
my mind, and I need
to get them out.


338
00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:07.136
I know you know I am out, and I
hope you know I am coming for


339
00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:11.408
you, just like I always said.
Just like I always said I was


340
00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:15.279
going to do, I am coming for
you.


341
00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:18.582
I wish I were standing at your
side, whispering in your ear,


342
00:35:19.103 --> 00:35:23.840
but that's not so. I came across the
woods and mountains with no shoes on.


343
00:35:25.532 --> 00:35:29.796
I traveled high and far,
and now I am close.


344
00:35:31.823 --> 00:35:35.268
I'm so close to you, I can almost
reach out and touch your cheek.


345
00:36:36.867 --> 00:36:38.615
Here you go, Don.

346
00:36:49.059 --> 00:36:50.884
You boys take it easy, now.

347
00:37:02.503 --> 00:37:05.583
Well... Look at you, Bob.

348
00:37:06.394 --> 00:37:10.162
Break out of parson and head
straight back here.


349
00:37:10.164 --> 00:37:15.501
Maybe not the smartest move.
Long as you don't turn me in.


350
00:37:29.773 --> 00:37:33.865
Where's Miles?
Miles is gone.


351
00:37:34.188 --> 00:37:38.290
Gone? Gladys is gone, too.

352
00:37:39.402 --> 00:37:42.572
It's just me now.
Well, who's running the show?


353
00:37:46.525 --> 00:37:50.127
No show to run... not anymore.

354
00:37:53.641 --> 00:37:59.111
Didn't this belong to Freddy?
Doubt it.


355
00:37:59.793 --> 00:38:04.718
I remember playing with this.
And all those little Indians...


356
00:38:06.354 --> 00:38:08.455
have you got those Indians
someplace?


357
00:38:09.518 --> 00:38:11.949
Anything of Freddy's is long gone.

358
00:38:14.629 --> 00:38:19.365
Hmm. What do you want, Bob?

359
00:38:19.367 --> 00:38:22.168
I was just wondering if you'd
heard anything.


360
00:38:23.072 --> 00:38:24.408
About what?

361
00:38:27.644 --> 00:38:30.991
About that local man who
escaped from the penitentiary.


362
00:38:33.268 --> 00:38:34.519
Gene Dentler and a bunch of

363
00:38:34.554 --> 00:38:37.684
his deputies come over a few
days ago for a chat.


364
00:38:37.686 --> 00:38:40.553
I told them I could think of at
least six sons of bitches who've


365
00:38:40.555 --> 00:38:45.825
got a mind to see you dead but
that it'd be more fun to sit


366
00:38:45.827 --> 00:38:51.397
back and take bets on who gets
you first.


367
00:38:51.399 --> 00:38:54.667
You fucked over your share of
people in your day.


368
00:38:54.669 --> 00:39:00.373
Yeah, and then I got caught.
Not by them, you didn't.


369
00:39:00.375 --> 00:39:03.577
Well, they might as well quit
looking.


370
00:39:03.579 --> 00:39:07.848
Old Bob Muldoon's about to
disappear.


371
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:11.585
And where's old Bob Muldoon
gonna disappear to?


372
00:39:12.784 --> 00:39:16.546
I'm thinking about settling
down, build a little house,


373
00:39:18.166 --> 00:39:21.049
open a shop. I don't know.

374
00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:26.827
Get old. Like you.

375
00:39:30.573 --> 00:39:33.440
On your own?

376
00:39:40.582 --> 00:39:43.224
Oh. So, I heard you bought
Ruth a house.


377
00:39:43.786 --> 00:39:46.954
I'm letting her stay in one
of my old places.


378
00:39:46.956 --> 00:39:50.524
It's got a big old yard where
her little girl can play.


379
00:39:50.526 --> 00:39:53.961
Hey, that's my little girl,
too.


380
00:39:53.963 --> 00:39:59.534
Man, I'll tell you... she's about
cute enough to make


381
00:40:00.082 --> 00:40:05.118
you want to give up.
You did one thing right.


382
00:40:05.809 --> 00:40:09.811
I'll give you that.
I do what I can to look after


383
00:40:09.813 --> 00:40:13.949
both of them. Yeah.

384
00:40:13.951 --> 00:40:17.619
Well, I guess I'll handle it
from here.


385
00:40:17.621 --> 00:40:21.590
Oh, you think so? Yes, sir.

386
00:40:21.592 --> 00:40:23.523
Well, I'll tell you what.

387
00:40:26.577 --> 00:40:28.698
You do whatever you want.

388
00:40:29.833 --> 00:40:34.569
You take all your money and you
get yourself as far away from


389
00:40:34.571 --> 00:40:39.500
here as you possibly can.
But you listen to me when I tell you...


390
00:40:41.783 --> 00:40:43.979
You leave those girls alone.

391
00:40:45.658 --> 00:40:50.985
I can't do that. 
Yeah, you can.

392
00:40:55.716 --> 00:41:00.772
And why would I?
Well, now, think about it, Bob.


393
00:41:02.222 --> 00:41:04.647
If you got any trouble
coming your way...


394
00:41:05.569 --> 00:41:07.718
They sure as hell
don't need that.


395
00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:12.342
What trouble is that?

396
00:41:15.582 --> 00:41:19.987
You got out.
What more do you want?


397
00:41:21.853 --> 00:41:24.253
I want my family.

398
00:41:27.752 --> 00:41:31.191
So do I. But I don't got it.

399
00:41:33.131 --> 00:41:37.366
Now, this is how it works.
I will never hurt you more than


400
00:41:37.368 --> 00:41:41.103
I'm hurting you now.
I will never lay another hand to


401
00:41:41.105 --> 00:41:45.408
you or prick your finger or
pinch your cheek.


402
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:48.744
I won't call the sheriff, and I
won't tell them where you've


403
00:41:48.746 --> 00:41:51.914
been. But if I hear that

404
00:41:51.916 --> 00:41:56.453
old Bob Muldoon has been talking
to Ruth Guthrie...


405
00:41:56.455 --> 00:42:02.392
You asked me about trouble.
I will make sure you got some.


406
00:42:21.347 --> 00:42:23.970
Freddy was the one
who shot first that day.


407
00:42:25.164 --> 00:42:27.893
Nobody would have gotten
hurt if he hadn't done that.


408
00:42:28.908 --> 00:42:30.558
Go on, Bob.

409
00:42:32.391 --> 00:42:38.195
I got to unlock my door.
Get out of here before someone


410
00:42:38.197 --> 00:42:41.198
sees you.
Find yourself someplace safe.


411
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:46.203
Where are the keys?

412
00:42:46.205 --> 00:42:48.105
In the truck. The keys?

413
00:42:48.107 --> 00:42:52.142
I'm gonna give her trouble?
I'm gonna give her trouble?


414
00:42:52.144 --> 00:42:55.480
He thinks he can buy her a
house?


415
00:42:55.482 --> 00:42:57.115
No, sir.
I don't think that's how it


416
00:42:57.117 --> 00:42:59.717
works.
Ruth will walk away from that


417
00:42:59.719 --> 00:43:04.155
house like it was on fire.

418
00:43:04.157 --> 00:43:06.457
Pen... I need a pen.

419
00:43:06.459 --> 00:43:09.460
Give me a pen.

420
00:43:14.189 --> 00:43:15.427
No damn sense.

421
00:43:38.864 --> 00:43:40.337
Excuse me.

422
00:44:51.003 --> 00:44:52.379
Come here.

423
00:44:57.315 --> 00:44:58.846
I was thinking...

424
00:45:01.362 --> 00:45:03.531
Maybe we could go on a trip...

425
00:45:06.281 --> 00:45:11.584
After your birthday.
What do you think about that...


426
00:45:11.982 --> 00:45:13.975
going someplace new?

427
00:45:15.614 --> 00:45:18.519
Just get in the car
and drive and drive.


428
00:45:19.562 --> 00:45:21.379
Be real fun.

429
00:45:30.063 --> 00:45:31.345
Hey!

430
00:45:32.013 --> 00:45:33.340
Hey, hold on.

431
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:43.432
Let me see that. Give it here.

432
00:45:58.155 --> 00:46:01.864
There you go. Come on. Go.

433
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:23.635
What do you think about me
closin' up... take you for a


434
00:46:24.029 --> 00:46:26.778
ride somewhere...
Get away for a little bit?


435
00:46:27.196 --> 00:46:29.630
Hmm?

436
00:46:32.668 --> 00:46:36.203
Hey, sweetie.

437
00:46:36.205 --> 00:46:39.707
How you been? Just fine.

438
00:46:39.709 --> 00:46:44.144
Break the law or something?

439
00:46:44.146 --> 00:46:47.415
No.
I just hadn't seen you around in


440
00:46:47.417 --> 00:46:51.219
years, it feels like.
I stay put.


441
00:46:51.221 --> 00:46:54.823
You want something to drink?
No, sir. Thank you.


442
00:46:54.825 --> 00:46:58.093
We're looking for an old friend
of yours.


443
00:46:58.095 --> 00:47:01.663
I'm sure you heard the news.
Yeah. Yeah.


444
00:47:01.665 --> 00:47:04.966
A couple cops came by from
Monroe's asking questions.


445
00:47:04.968 --> 00:47:09.671
All right. Have you seen him?

446
00:47:09.673 --> 00:47:13.875
Sure haven't. Look, all right.

447
00:47:13.877 --> 00:47:18.346
You mind if I take a look
around?


448
00:47:18.348 --> 00:47:23.485
Billy, mind the bar?
Hope we can make this quick.


449
00:47:23.487 --> 00:47:26.488
Don't want to rile up my
customers.


450
00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:30.759
Haven't heard from him since

451
00:47:30.761 --> 00:47:32.694
last winter.
He sent me a letter.


452
00:47:32.696 --> 00:47:37.065
You write him back? Nope.

453
00:47:37.067 --> 00:47:40.001
Weren't you part of his old
gang... Bob Muldoon,


454
00:47:40.003 --> 00:47:43.104
Ruth Guthrie, Freddy?
Nope. Got out of that racket.


455
00:47:43.106 --> 00:47:48.644
Got myself this business.

456
00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:58.395
Hell.
Left the darn key downstairs.


457
00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:01.757
Well... Hold up.

458
00:48:28.934 --> 00:48:31.505
I'm gonna need to get back to
the register before too long.


459
00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.470
Been using it as a bookmark.
I guess I lost my place.


460
00:48:52.544 --> 00:48:56.213
Ruth give it to you?
She mailed it.


461
00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.059
Asked me, uh... asked me to send
it on to Bob.


462
00:49:02.221 --> 00:49:05.889
You never did.
Like I said, I'm bad with


463
00:49:05.891 --> 00:49:10.961
correspondence. How long ago?

464
00:49:10.963 --> 00:49:16.433
How old's the little girl?

465
00:49:16.435 --> 00:49:22.139
About that long, then. Okay.

466
00:49:22.141 --> 00:49:27.444
Uh, mind if I hang on to this?
By all means.


467
00:49:27.446 --> 00:49:30.180
I'm sure you'll call us if
you hear anything.


468
00:49:30.182 --> 00:49:32.182
Sure bet.

469
00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:41.739
Look at this.

470
00:49:42.568 --> 00:49:46.187
This is the first thing you ever
wore, the day you were born.


471
00:49:48.581 --> 00:49:52.706
You were so tiny.
Look how small it is.


472
00:49:56.376 --> 00:49:59.610
I brought you home, and you
slept and slept for hours.


473
00:49:59.612 --> 00:50:05.149
You were such a good little
girl.


474
00:50:05.151 --> 00:50:10.621
I'll bring this with us just
because...


475
00:50:10.623 --> 00:50:16.427
We might need it someday.
"And the little horse picked up"


476
00:50:16.429 --> 00:50:21.666
his shoes and ran until he was
out of the dark woods.


477
00:50:21.668 --> 00:50:23.901
He came to the river where the
fish had been.


478
00:50:23.903 --> 00:50:26.938
The fish was gone now, and there
was no one there to stop him


479
00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:30.975
from crossing.
He crossed the river and climbed


480
00:50:31.654 --> 00:50:34.024
the hill, and before too long,
he could see home."


481
00:50:37.408 --> 00:50:40.973
What's wrong, sweet girl?
Why are you so quiet?


482
00:50:42.931 --> 00:50:48.154
Everything's gonna be fine.
You just wait and see, okay?


483
00:52:18.449 --> 00:52:20.471
Have you heard from Bob?

484
00:52:23.091 --> 00:52:26.426
Why don't you come in? No.

485
00:52:26.428 --> 00:52:31.064
I know Bob's been around.
Will you see to it that he gets


486
00:52:31.066 --> 00:52:35.469
this? What is it?

487
00:52:35.471 --> 00:52:41.208
You can read it if you want.
I figure you will anyway.


488
00:52:41.615 --> 00:52:46.017
If you see him...
Can you tell him...


489
00:52:48.818 --> 00:52:50.985
Just... just give it to him.

490
00:53:08.457 --> 00:53:13.227
Dear Bob...
I hope you never get this.


491
00:53:14.701 --> 00:53:17.134
I want you to come
through that door,


492
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:20.016
take us away just
like you always said.


493
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:25.682
But you can't.

494
00:53:26.822 --> 00:53:32.059
You can't come here...
not right now.


495
00:53:32.061 --> 00:53:37.132
And I can't go with you.
If you come here, they'll catch


496
00:53:37.134 --> 00:53:40.802
you.
If we go with you, they'll find


497
00:53:40.804 --> 00:53:45.373
us. It can't end like that.

498
00:53:45.375 --> 00:53:49.778
I can't let it end like that,
not for us...


499
00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:55.650
And not for Sylvie.
I can't let that happen.


500
00:53:58.895 --> 00:54:04.218
So, we're gonna go. If you come
looking for us here, we'll be gone.


501
00:54:05.904 --> 00:54:08.686
I'll go somewhere where
no one knows who we are,


502
00:54:09.247 --> 00:54:13.982
or we can wait for the
time to be right and the


503
00:54:14.237 --> 00:54:16.284
world to forget about us.

504
00:54:18.237 --> 00:54:21.143
I don't know how to
explain this any better,


505
00:54:21.604 --> 00:54:24.482
but I know you know
what I'm talking about.


506
00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:31.155
We've waited so long.
We've just got to wait a little longer.


507
00:54:35.259 --> 00:54:39.176
Come find us. I know you will.

508
00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:43.655
I hope you will.
We'll find each other.


509
00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:50.657
I love you so much. I do.

510
00:55:13.808 --> 00:55:16.231
It's time to wake up, baby girl.

511
00:55:24.135 --> 00:55:25.860
Sweet pea...

512
00:55:27.912 --> 00:55:32.716
Good morning. Happy Birthday.

513
00:56:39.719 --> 00:56:40.603
You seen him?

514
00:58:17.592 --> 00:58:19.653
We stopped by his girl's place.

515
00:58:30.263 --> 00:58:33.168
Hartigan said to tell you
something if we ran into you.


516
00:58:33.203 --> 00:58:37.136
What's that?

517
00:58:37.138 --> 00:58:42.775
Shit, I forgot. Oh.

518
00:58:42.777 --> 00:58:47.513
Let me tell you something.
You take that and do what you


519
00:58:47.515 --> 00:58:52.518
will.
And if you don't find him...


520
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.455
That don't give you cause to
come back here.


521
00:58:55.457 --> 00:59:00.626
You understand?
Don't think I'm washing my hands


522
00:59:00.628 --> 00:59:05.164
of all this.
And if you set foot in this town


523
00:59:05.166 --> 00:59:09.669
again...
If you even think about bringing


524
00:59:09.671 --> 00:59:15.441
those girls into this...
I'll kill you.


525
00:59:15.443 --> 00:59:19.212
And that'll be that. Dude.

526
00:59:22.218 --> 00:59:26.720
Warren Miller.
Who makes up the names?


527
00:59:26.722 --> 00:59:29.523
They ain't made up.
They're real folks.


528
00:59:29.525 --> 00:59:32.693
I mean, they're dead, but...
They're real.


529
00:59:32.695 --> 00:59:36.096
Oh, really? Mm-hmm.

530
00:59:36.098 --> 00:59:38.492
So I'm told.
Ruth and Sylvie, too?


531
00:59:39.243 --> 00:59:40.361
Yep.

532
00:59:41.981 --> 00:59:44.113
Nobody's gonna be
asking after us?


533
00:59:44.725 --> 00:59:46.572
Not anymore.

534
00:59:47.143 --> 00:59:49.510
Good job.

535
00:59:49.512 --> 00:59:52.880
You make a wish?
What did you wish for?


536
00:59:52.882 --> 00:59:55.549
I'm not telling. All right.

537
00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:58.252
You keep your little secret, huh?

538
01:00:25.384 --> 01:00:30.114
How do I look?
You look like you.


539
01:00:31.288 --> 01:00:37.158
Then that'll do.
The way I see it, I didn't waste


540
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.495
my time.
You remember old Joe cranston?


541
01:00:40.497 --> 01:00:44.232
Yep.
Remember that time he and I


542
01:00:44.234 --> 01:00:45.900
went up to St. Louis? Mm-hmm.

543
01:00:45.902 --> 01:00:49.137
He spent about three hours
getting prettied up before we


544
01:00:49.139 --> 01:00:50.305
got in the car to go up there.
I said, "Joe, what are you"


545
01:00:50.307 --> 01:00:54.109
doing?"
He said, "well, in case anything


546
01:00:54.111 --> 01:00:58.379
happens to me, I want to make
sure my mama can recognize me."


547
01:00:58.381 --> 01:01:01.049
So he put on this coat he had
when he was 12 years old, and he


548
01:01:01.051 --> 01:01:03.418
tried to button it up, and he
was a big old boy, and it ripped


549
01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:07.088
right out the back.
And he kept that thing on all


550
01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:10.024
the way up to St. Louis and back
down to Texas.


551
01:01:10.026 --> 01:01:12.527
He looked like a damn
raggedy Ann.


552
01:01:12.529 --> 01:01:15.463
And when we got back, I said,
"Joe, you know your mama would


553
01:01:15.465 --> 01:01:17.799
have recognized you if something
happened to you."


554
01:01:17.801 --> 01:01:20.703
He said, "yeah, 'cause I had my
coat on."


555
01:01:20.705 --> 01:01:23.205
I mean, he didn't get it.
You see, people... they don't


556
01:01:23.207 --> 01:01:25.574
know things the way that they
think they know them.


557
01:01:34.674 --> 01:01:36.836
Sylvie... she's gonna know me.

558
01:01:38.849 --> 01:01:41.136
She'll know me
without looking at me.


559
01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:48.597
And Ruth... by God, she'll feel
me coming down the street.


560
01:01:48.599 --> 01:01:54.170
I mean, we always just been...
You know, just two parts of the


561
01:01:54.172 --> 01:01:59.575
same.
I mean, we would fight, and we'd


562
01:01:59.577 --> 01:02:04.647
fight like two kids with a ball.
And she'd rip through the house


563
01:02:04.649 --> 01:02:08.651
like she was on fire, and I'd
just want to hold her.


564
01:02:08.653 --> 01:02:10.653
I'd just want to hold her.

565
01:02:10.655 --> 01:02:12.896
But she'd be yelling and
flapping around so quick, it was


566
01:02:13.573 --> 01:02:18.874
like a hummingbird.
I'd say, "Ruth..."


567
01:02:19.765 --> 01:02:23.033
You can scream at me till your
voice is gone...


568
01:02:23.035 --> 01:02:26.670
But it doesn't make much
difference...


569
01:02:26.672 --> 01:02:30.407
Because when you're all done
screaming...


570
01:02:30.409 --> 01:02:35.378
"It's just gonna be you and me
sitting here in a room."


571
01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:40.183
And she said, "that's right.
It's always just gonna be the"


572
01:02:40.185 --> 01:02:45.188
"two of us."

573
01:02:54.611 --> 01:02:58.177
Look how pretty that is.
You like that?


574
01:03:00.983 --> 01:03:02.586
Happy Birthday.

575
01:03:04.536 --> 01:03:10.076
Well, there's, uh, one
last... Surprise, I suppose.


576
01:03:10.816 --> 01:03:14.451
You know how to open these?

577
01:03:14.453 --> 01:03:18.122
All right. Let's open her up.
Yeah.


578
01:03:18.124 --> 01:03:22.193
Okay.
So, this was mine when I was


579
01:03:22.195 --> 01:03:25.463
about your size.
Let's see how it looks on you.


580
01:03:27.405 --> 01:03:30.665
Say hi to Ruth for me?
I'll tell her.


581
01:03:32.672 --> 01:03:36.340
I guess I hope I never see
you again.


582
01:03:48.663 --> 01:03:51.010
â™ª ... My love to the day

583
01:03:52.325 --> 01:03:57.728
â™ª my precious little goodbye
â™ª stay


584
01:04:04.337 --> 01:04:10.074
â™ª well, I hollered up into the

585
01:04:10.076 --> 01:04:13.745
night â™ª
â™ª and I hollered up into the


586
01:04:13.747 --> 01:04:17.949
day â™ª
â™ª and from that big black hole


587
01:04:17.951 --> 01:04:23.055
come running down â™ª
â™ª back every word that I would


588
01:04:23.057 --> 01:04:28.727
say â™ª
â™ª forever mine has gone away


589
01:04:28.729 --> 01:04:29.229
â™ª away

590
01:05:40.329 --> 01:05:43.500
How's a dog sound? Ruff, ruff.

591
01:05:43.535 --> 01:05:45.805
Ruff, ruff? Try that.

592
01:05:45.807 --> 01:05:48.808
Ruff, ruff, and then go back

593
01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:50.376
to cat.

594
01:05:50.378 --> 01:05:52.979
Try that.
â™ª and some will travel 'cross


595
01:05:52.981 --> 01:05:55.815
the land, looking for their
love â™ª


596
01:05:55.817 --> 01:05:57.450
One more time.

597
01:05:57.452 --> 01:06:03.423
â™ª Others gaze upon the sea
and search the sky above â™ª


598
01:06:03.425 --> 01:06:08.612
â™ª But count me not among them
â™ª as I was before


599
01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:15.869
â™ª now I go wandering
â™ª wandering no more


600
01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:19.973
â™ª I shall go wandering no more,
my lord â™ª


601
01:06:20.521 --> 01:06:25.530
â™ª I shall go wandering no more
you are all the treasure â™ª


602
01:06:27.508 --> 01:06:33.351
â™ª That I've been searching for
â™ª I shall go wandering no more


603
01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:39.226
â™ª I shall go wandering no more

604
01:06:43.159 --> 01:06:46.754
Why don't you hang on to this?
Maybe in a week or so, I'll


605
01:06:47.002 --> 01:06:51.171
check back in with you, and
maybe you'll play me a song.


606
01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:53.073
How's that? No.

607
01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:56.376
No?
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.


608
01:06:56.378 --> 01:07:01.915
A trip? Is that right? Mm-hmm.

609
01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:07.856
She's great.

610
01:07:26.682 --> 01:07:31.257
You all right? Yeah, I'm fine.

611
01:09:53.377 --> 01:09:55.528
What are you doing here?

612
01:10:04.449 --> 01:10:08.317
Well, I didn't mean to wear
out my welcome.


613
01:10:08.828 --> 01:10:11.239
No. I just want to know.

614
01:10:14.047 --> 01:10:16.256
Just happy to be here.

615
01:10:17.983 --> 01:10:20.507
You're planning on leaving?

616
01:10:20.586 --> 01:10:22.720
Yes, I am. All right.

617
01:10:22.722 --> 01:10:28.259
You know where you're headed?
No, I don't know yet... just


618
01:10:28.261 --> 01:10:32.263
away from here.
Well, if you need any help...


619
01:10:32.265 --> 01:10:34.069
I don't need anything.

620
01:10:37.674 --> 01:10:40.077
I appreciate the invitation, and

621
01:10:40.456 --> 01:10:46.152
I bid you good night.
Good night.


622
01:11:10.704 --> 01:11:11.204
Ruth.

623
01:11:14.908 --> 01:11:20.378
I want to tell you something.
This has been, uh, weighing on


624
01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:25.817
me for some time.
Uh... When I was in the hospital,


625
01:11:25.819 --> 01:11:30.690
I wasn't, uh... I wasn't sitting
there making plans or anything.


626
01:11:32.192 --> 01:11:35.460
You know, I got nothing against
Bob.


627
01:11:35.462 --> 01:11:38.463
And what happened... I mean,
that's the risk.


628
01:11:38.465 --> 01:11:42.300
That's... that's part of my job.
And beyond that, I don't hold it


629
01:11:42.302 --> 01:11:45.570
against him to be who he was or
do what he was doing, and I


630
01:11:45.572 --> 01:11:49.174
still don't.
I'm glad to be alive.


631
01:11:49.176 --> 01:11:53.278
I'm glad to know you.
And if you weren't who you were


632
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.984
and had never been with him and
somehow we had still come


633
01:11:58.575 --> 01:12:00.784
together right here, right now,

634
01:12:01.543 --> 01:12:03.833
I wouldn't feel any different.

635
01:12:06.258 --> 01:12:07.888
Do you understand?

636
01:12:11.178 --> 01:12:13.327
You remember that day?

637
01:12:13.362 --> 01:12:16.469
I remember getting shot.
I remember feeling like I'm


638
01:12:16.471 --> 01:12:20.373
getting punched in the shoulder,
seeing the big old Texas sky.


639
01:12:20.375 --> 01:12:24.343
I remember that, but, uh...
Did you see me?


640
01:12:24.345 --> 01:12:28.381
No, ma'am.
Did you hear what I said


641
01:12:28.383 --> 01:12:34.287
after? I read your statement.

642
01:12:34.289 --> 01:12:38.291
It wasn't all true, you know.
I wasn't just a little girl who


643
01:12:38.293 --> 01:12:41.460
got dragged in over her head.
I knew what I was doing.


644
01:12:41.462 --> 01:12:46.833
Well... I think that, uh...

645
01:12:46.835 --> 01:12:52.438
A lot of things were said that
might not have been true.


646
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:57.644
But you did what you did.
So did he.


647
01:12:57.646 --> 01:13:02.783
And whatever it is you've done,
when I see you with your


648
01:13:02.785 --> 01:13:06.920
daughter... All I see is good.

649
01:13:19.494 --> 01:13:21.604
Maybe I'm just fooling you.

650
01:13:24.915 --> 01:13:26.447
Are you?

651
01:14:29.725 --> 01:14:30.600
Ugh!

652
01:14:37.113 --> 01:14:41.049
Ugh!

653
01:14:47.090 --> 01:14:49.424
Wait. Wait, God damn it!

654
01:15:38.175 --> 01:15:39.608
Ugh!

655
01:15:39.610 --> 01:15:44.046
Ugh! Ugh!

656
01:15:59.293 --> 01:16:00.402
Ugh.

657
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:18.065
God damn it.

658
01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.396
You shot me.
Why'd you shoot me?


659
01:16:27.343 --> 01:16:30.460
I've never even seen you.
No, sir.


660
01:16:30.462 --> 01:16:33.930
What's this about... money?

661
01:16:35.184 --> 01:16:39.923
You... it's about you.
You and the girl.


662
01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.599
Everything you tried to do.

663
01:16:50.736 --> 01:16:52.543
You gonna shoot me?

664
01:17:40.753 --> 01:17:43.316
I don't want you to think
I owe you anything.


665
01:17:44.103 --> 01:17:45.853
No, you don't.

666
01:17:45.888 --> 01:17:49.207
The only person I owe
anything to is Bob.


667
01:17:50.209 --> 01:17:51.890
That's not so.

668
01:17:54.984 --> 01:17:57.793
I've been storing
things up all this time...


669
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:04.640
Sitting awake at night, thinking of
all the things I want to say to him.


670
01:18:05.969 --> 01:18:09.561
Except now I have so many
things, I don't know how I'd


671
01:18:09.563 --> 01:18:14.599
ever start.
All I had was Sylvie and I.


672
01:18:14.601 --> 01:18:17.903
I didn't know how to write about
her.


673
01:18:17.905 --> 01:18:23.208
How do you write about something
like that?


674
01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:28.847
I remember the day she was born.
I was so scared, and I tried to


675
01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:33.138
keep her from coming, but she
came anyway.


676
01:18:35.622 --> 01:18:37.656
And when they put her in my
arms...


677
01:18:37.658 --> 01:18:40.058
Ugh!

678
01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:43.828
We just stared at one
another, and I thought I would


679
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:48.768
die from all that love.
And I tried to write to him


680
01:18:48.770 --> 01:18:52.271
about it so he'd know what it
was like, but... but I just


681
01:18:52.273 --> 01:18:55.074
couldn't find the words to do it
right.


682
01:18:55.076 --> 01:18:59.212
So, I just stopped... stopped
writing to him.


683
01:18:59.214 --> 01:19:04.617
I figured that I'd just tell him
all at once when I saw him.


684
01:19:04.619 --> 01:19:08.654
He'd walk through the door, and
I'd know exactly what to say to


685
01:19:08.656 --> 01:19:11.624
him, and things would be the way
they used to be.


686
01:19:11.626 --> 01:19:15.628
That's why I've been saving
every little thing.


687
01:19:22.504 --> 01:19:24.967
And I haven't slept in four
years...


688
01:19:26.382 --> 01:19:31.805
And I'm tired.
I'm just so goddamn tired.


689
01:19:35.197 --> 01:19:36.894
Then rest.

690
01:19:39.171 --> 01:19:41.932
Will you wait with
me while I do?


691
01:20:11.496 --> 01:20:14.773
Are you all right? Okay?
Hey, what are you... what are you doing?


692
01:20:15.285 --> 01:20:16.748
Drive, man. Drive.

693
01:20:17.168 --> 01:20:18.825
Please, just take the keys.
Step on the gas, man!


694
01:20:18.827 --> 01:20:21.328
Step on the gas!

695
01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:23.063
All right.

696
01:20:23.065 --> 01:20:26.233
And just stick to the highway.
When you get to highway 6, you


697
01:20:26.235 --> 01:20:28.368
turn right.
I... I'm just trying to go see


698
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:30.504
my family, okay?
I'm just trying to get home.


699
01:20:30.506 --> 01:20:33.073
I ain't gonna put up a fight.
I'll do whatever you want.


700
01:20:33.075 --> 01:20:35.142
I just want to make sure I get
home to them.


701
01:20:35.144 --> 01:20:39.713
I just want you to drive.

702
01:20:39.715 --> 01:20:44.352
What's your family?

703
01:20:44.354 --> 01:20:49.791
What? What family have you got?

704
01:20:49.793 --> 01:20:54.862
You have a wife and kids? No.

705
01:20:54.864 --> 01:20:59.734
No, I'm going to see my parents.
Your parents?


706
01:20:59.736 --> 01:21:02.303
Mom and dad? Yeah.

707
01:21:02.305 --> 01:21:05.940
What's your name?

708
01:21:05.942 --> 01:21:11.746
Will. Will's your name?

709
01:21:11.748 --> 01:21:15.350
Yeah.
Will, do you have anything to


710
01:21:15.352 --> 01:21:19.387
drink? No.

711
01:21:19.389 --> 01:21:22.156
You don't? Unh-unh.

712
01:21:22.158 --> 01:21:26.461
Shoot.
I could go for some water.


713
01:21:32.307 --> 01:21:34.840
You need to... you need to go

714
01:21:34.875 --> 01:21:38.239
to a hospital or something?
No, man.


715
01:21:38.241 --> 01:21:41.443
Just stay on the highway.
Turn at highway number 6.


716
01:21:41.445 --> 01:21:46.115
Yes, sir.

717
01:21:51.837 --> 01:21:55.620
Well, I guess you can
tell I got shot. Yep.


718
01:22:00.357 --> 01:22:02.331
These men came looking for me.

719
01:22:03.295 --> 01:22:09.139
They wanted to put me under.
Somebody sent them, and they


720
01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:15.210
came from somewhere,
and they got me.


721
01:22:15.212 --> 01:22:20.983
They got me pretty good.
They didn't get me good enough.


722
01:22:27.358 --> 01:22:33.228
See... Ohh.

723
01:22:33.230 --> 01:22:36.231
Tell your daddy who you gave a
ride to today.


724
01:22:36.878 --> 01:22:40.583
Okay. Who?

725
01:22:43.041 --> 01:22:47.911
What? Who are you?

726
01:23:47.607 --> 01:23:48.107
Hey!

727
01:23:51.644 --> 01:23:54.912
Drop it!

728
01:24:26.979 --> 01:24:31.482
It's all right.

729
01:24:31.484 --> 01:24:36.488
You remember...

730
01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:40.959
Remember the first run you ever
did for me?


731
01:24:41.598 --> 01:24:45.714
Huh? Heh. You and Freddy.

732
01:24:47.503 --> 01:24:52.972
The very first one.
Nah, I never did nothing for you, sir.


733
01:25:02.608 --> 01:25:05.040
You both thought you were so
tough.


734
01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:12.909
You were little boys.

735
01:25:20.921 --> 01:25:22.474
Ohh.

736
01:26:10.934 --> 01:26:14.989
I want to go home.
I was on the line with Morgan


737
01:26:15.623 --> 01:26:17.556
10 minutes ago... told him how
it happened.


738
01:26:17.558 --> 01:26:19.358
No, no, no.
You get 'em back on the phone


739
01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:21.494
'till they come down here.
I don't know who did what to


740
01:26:21.496 --> 01:26:23.062
who. Did you get an I.D. Yet?

741
01:26:23.064 --> 01:26:26.465
No.
I mean, yeah, but he was just


742
01:26:26.467 --> 01:26:28.234
some son of a bitch up near
burleson.


743
01:26:28.236 --> 01:26:32.611
Who knows?
Skerritt went out like a sucker, huh?


744
01:26:35.185 --> 01:26:36.877
I'm gonna take Ruth on home.

745
01:26:36.879 --> 01:26:42.049
No, I got Teddy doing that.
Yeah, I'm gonna take her.


746
01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:05.103
Wait here.

747
01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:44.143
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.


748
01:28:00.624 --> 01:28:02.391
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

749
01:28:07.948 --> 01:28:09.901
I've been waiting for you.

750
01:28:26.589 --> 01:28:29.858
Stop it. That tickles.
I thought that's what we're


751
01:28:30.433 --> 01:28:34.980
supposed to do... sing to 'em.
Just talk.


752
01:28:38.091 --> 01:28:42.255
Well...
Let me tell you about something.


753
01:28:43.541 --> 01:28:47.342
I'm gonna tell you about the
future.


754
01:28:47.344 --> 01:28:51.480
In the future, I'm a very old
man.


755
01:28:51.482 --> 01:28:56.718
And I'm standing in the door.
We're in a house.


756
01:28:57.242 --> 01:29:02.357
It's our house, somewhere far
away from here, where everything


757
01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:06.829
is green and the
sun is almost set.


758
01:29:06.831 --> 01:29:11.896
And where we're standing, the way I see it,
we're waving to somebody.


759
01:29:13.789 --> 01:29:16.340
And maybe that somebody is you,

760
01:29:17.942 --> 01:29:21.093
come to see us after
a long time gone.


761
01:29:23.754 --> 01:29:28.734
If it is you...
We are very happy to see you.


762
01:29:30.655 --> 01:29:32.989
Hey, sweetie.

763
01:30:01.276 --> 01:30:03.399
Tell me more about that house.

764
01:30:05.866 --> 01:30:07.644
I'm not talking to you.

765
01:30:09.944 --> 01:30:13.802
It's big... Maybe a farm.

766
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:18.557
It's old. It's older than us.

767
01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:25.420
At the same time, though,
I feel like maybe I built it.


768
01:30:28.239 --> 01:30:29.969
There's no telling.

769
01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:35.517
There's just no telling.

770
01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:35.195
â™ª Left your home at 23

771
01:33:35.866 --> 01:33:38.833
â™ª suitcase full of gin

772
01:33:39.706 --> 01:33:42.937
â™ª thought you had the perfect...

773
01:33:43.409 --> 01:33:45.219
getaway â™ª

774
01:33:47.367 --> 01:33:51.071
â™ª Stole yourself across the hills â™ª

775
01:33:51.416 --> 01:33:54.471
â™ª You stole, you stole again

776
01:33:55.090 --> 01:33:59.621
â™ª Now the lights don't shine
'cause you're away â™ª


777
01:34:03.529 --> 01:34:09.421
â™ª You stuffed that suitcase full
with dirty $100 bills â™ª


778
01:34:11.129 --> 01:34:15.204
â™ª Leaving for another holiday

779
01:34:18.691 --> 01:34:24.453
â™ª Found yourself surrounded by
the city's finest clowns â™ª


780
01:34:25.777 --> 01:34:30.666
â™ª Now the lights don't shine
while you're away â™ª


781
01:34:33.913 --> 01:34:39.696
â™ª Must have been a memory put
you out to sea â™ª


782
01:34:42.338 --> 01:34:46.571
â™ª You were never one for big
displays â™ª


783
01:34:48.877 --> 01:34:51.972
â™ª Well, the devil seems to think

784
01:34:52.422 --> 01:34:56.214
â™ª these complications suit you well â™ª

785
01:34:56.719 --> 01:35:01.321
â™ª 'cause the lights don't shine
while you're away â™ª


786
01:35:21.612 --> 01:35:26.395
â™ª Starin' at that picture in
your mama's dining room â™ª


787
01:35:28.104 --> 01:35:32.740
â™ª Taken just before your
birthday â™ª


788
01:35:36.071 --> 01:35:42.007
â™ª She keeps asking if I know
when you'll be coming home â™ª


789
01:35:43.234 --> 01:35:48.380
â™ª 'Cause the lights don't shine
while you're away â™ª
