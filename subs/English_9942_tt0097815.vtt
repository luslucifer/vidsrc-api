1
00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:31.776
Yeah!

2
00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.403
Stay! Stay!

3
00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:36.322
-Stay!
-I got it!


4
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:36.048
Good morning, gentlemen,

5
00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:39.051
and welcome to another season
of Indians baseball.


6
00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:46.475
I know it may not seem the same
without Donald here,


7
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:49.186
but I promise you,
by the end of this season,


8
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:51.606
we will have made history.

9
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.152
Unfortunately, there are
some in the press who feel that


10
00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:59.655
"the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps

11
00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.868
"has no business being the owner
of a major league baseball team."


12
00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:07.330
Spring training begins in two weeks.

13
00:04:07.831 --> 00:04:11.334
Here's a list of the players
we'll be inviting to camp.


14
00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:17.506
I never heard of half of these guys,

15
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.009
and the ones I do know
are way past their prime.


16
00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.928
Most of these guys never had a prime.

17
00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:25.556
The facts are, we lost
our two best players to free agency.


18
00:04:25.724 --> 00:04:27.516
We haven't won a pennant
in over 35 years.


19
00:04:27.601 --> 00:04:31.020
We haven't placed higher than fourth
in the last 15.


20
00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.481
Obviously, it's time for some changes.

21
00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:37.526
-This guy here is dead.
-Cross him off, then.


22
00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:40.154
Spring training starts on the 1st.

23
00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:43.199
How do you think the Indians
will do this year?


24
00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:45.284
It doesn't look too good.

25
00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:48.371
These guys don't look too fucking good.

26
00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:57.129
Oh, hi, Charlie. 
Come in, have a seat.

27
00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:58.798
I'm glad you called me in.

28
00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:01.884
I'm still unclear
about a couple of things.


29
00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:03.302
Oh, really? Like what?

30
00:05:03.387 --> 00:05:06.514
Well, if I'm the GM,
who's gonna be the manager?


31
00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.767
I was thinking of Lou Brown.

32
00:05:10.394 --> 00:05:11.727
Who's Lou Brown?

33
00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:14.105
He's managed the Toledo Mud Hens
of the International League


34
00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:15.982
for the last 30 years.

35
00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:18.985
I think he'll fit right in
with our team concept.


36
00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:21.654
What exactly is our team concept?

37
00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.031
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about, Charlie.


38
00:05:24.116 --> 00:05:28.035
I want to put together a team
that'll help us relocate to Miami.


39
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.412
What do you mean?

40
00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:31.288
Some of these guys
are furniture movers?


41
00:05:31.373 --> 00:05:33.958
I'm serious about this, Charlie.

42
00:05:34.042 --> 00:05:37.712
It's no secret
I've never liked Cleveland much.


43
00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:41.340
The stadium's falling apart,
we don't draw dick, the weather's lousy.


44
00:05:41.425 --> 00:05:42.466
Another couple years of this,

45
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:45.970
and I'm gonna have to start
feeding Cha-Cha real dog food.


46
00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:49.682
Mrs. Phelps, you just can't
up and move a team on a whim.


47
00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:51.517
It's hardly a whim.

48
00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:55.479
Miami's offered
to build us a new stadium:


49
00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:57.690
62,000 capacity,

50
00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.775
45 VIP boxes,

51
00:06:00.152 --> 00:06:02.069
and for me, a mansion in Boca Raton,

52
00:06:02.154 --> 00:06:06.073
plus free membership in
the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club.


53
00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:09.744
Now, no other franchise in baseball
can match that deal.


54
00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.370
The league will never let us
leave Cleveland.


55
00:06:11.455 --> 00:06:13.122
We got a lease with the city.

56
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.874
The lease says
we have the right to move


57
00:06:14.958 --> 00:06:17.251
if the attendance falls below 800,000
for the year.


58
00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.253
Paragraph 40, line 17.

59
00:06:19.337 --> 00:06:22.548
If we play bad enough, we should
be able to come in under that.


60
00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:24.925
What are you saying?
You want us to lose?


61
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:27.303
No. We've been losing.

62
00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:31.807
What I want is for
us to finish dead last.

63
00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.707
-Yeah?
-Hello, Jake?


64
00:06:56.792 --> 00:07:00.628
This is Charlie Donovan,
the new GM of the Cleveland Indians.


65
00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.004
Yeah.

66
00:07:02.214 --> 00:07:03.881
We'd love for you
to come to spring training


67
00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.424
for a shot at this year's club.

68
00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.052
-Is that you, Talbert?
-What?


69
00:07:08.136 --> 00:07:10.846
This isn't very funny, you know.
I'm hung over,


70
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:13.140
my knees are killing me,
and if you're gonna pull this shit,


71
00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:16.685
at least you could have said
you were from the Yankees.


72
00:07:18.522 --> 00:07:19.522
Tire World.

73
00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:22.858
Hello, Lou? This is Charlie Donovan
of the Cleveland Indians.


74
00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:25.736
How would you like to manage
the Indians this year?


75
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:27.530
I don't know.

76
00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:29.615
What do you mean, you don't know?

77
00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.826
This is a chance to manage
in the big leagues.


78
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.494
Let me think it over, will you, Charlie?

79
00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:36.288
I got a guy on the other line
about some whitewalls.


80
00:07:36.373 --> 00:07:38.040
I'll talk to you later.

81
00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:40.876
Rick, we heard about your pitching
out of Portland last year.


82
00:07:41.002 --> 00:07:42.920
I'm not really with them anymore.

83
00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:44.713
Well, we'd still like to
take a look at you

84
00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:47.424
at our spring camp in Arizona,
March the 1st.


85
00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:50.219
Well, I'm not sure I
can make it by then.

86
00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.419
There's Jake Taylor.

87
00:08:24.087 --> 00:08:25.671
He was an all-star at Boston, wasn't he?

88
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.965
Yeah, wound up in the Mexican League.

89
00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.050
Had some problems with his knees.

90
00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:33.220
-Wish we had him two years ago.
-We did.


91
00:08:33.305 --> 00:08:35.181
Four years ago, then.

92
00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.397
Who is that?

93
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:45.441
Must be Cerrano.

94
00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.319
Defected from Cuba.
Wanted religious freedom.


95
00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.279
What's his religion?

96
00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.282
Voodoo.

97
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.295
I thought you didn't have
any high-priced talent.


98
00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:08.631
Forgot about Dorn,
'cause he's only high-priced.


99
00:09:08.715 --> 00:09:10.799
Picked him up as a free agent
three years ago.


100
00:09:10.884 --> 00:09:12.760
Still hits the ball pretty well, doesn't he?

101
00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:15.054
Yeah. He just can't field it.

102
00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.600
We'll shape him up.

103
00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:21.268
Hey.

104
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.316
I don't recognize this guy.

105
00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:33.113
Say, hey. Willie Mays Hayes here.

106
00:09:33.198 --> 00:09:35.616
Play like Mays, but I run like Hayes.

107
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.701
How you doing?

108
00:09:37.786 --> 00:09:39.245
How you doing?

109
00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:43.332
-My man.
-Lou Brown. Nice to meet you, Hayes.


110
00:09:43.416 --> 00:09:46.168
The parking lot is right out there.

111
00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:49.713
Thanks.

112
00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:53.217
Oh, and don't you guys go anywhere.

113
00:09:53.343 --> 00:09:56.178
I plan to put on a hitting display.

114
00:09:58.265 --> 00:10:00.891
I don't remember a Hayes on the list.

115
00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.661
Look at this fucking guy.

116
00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:28.836
My kinda team, Charlie.
It's my kinda team.


117
00:10:32.716 --> 00:10:33.841
Mr. Dorn.

118
00:10:33.925 --> 00:10:35.926
Harris! How you doing?

119
00:10:36.011 --> 00:10:37.970
Hey, that weave is looking good, huh?

120
00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:40.639
It's better than that rug of yours.

121
00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:42.474
Whoa! Another freak show candidate.

122
00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:45.269
How do you cut your hair, rook?
Vegematic?


123
00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:49.940
The earring's cute, too. Have you got
the matching bracelet, veg-head?


124
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:52.735
Whoa.

125
00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.951
-Watch yourself, Rog.
-Mr. Tough Guy.


126
00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.126
Hi. Jake Taylor.

127
00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:16.342
So, you got a name,
or are you gonna settle for "veg-head"?


128
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:19.094
-Vaughn. Rick Vaughn.
-Hi, Rick.


129
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:20.554
Hey, forget about Dorn.

130
00:11:20.638 --> 00:11:22.139
He's always a little tough
on the rookies.


131
00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:23.849
You get a lot worse from other clubs.

132
00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:27.144
Say, hey! How you doing?
Willie Mays Hayes here.


133
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.937
Jake Taylor here.

134
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.190
Rick Vaughn.

135
00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.941
What the hell league
you been playing in?


136
00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:34.693
California Penal.

137
00:11:34.778 --> 00:11:37.404
Never heard of it.
Well, how'd you end up playing there?


138
00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:38.906
Stole a car.

139
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.288
Hey, big guy. You a golfer?

140
00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.458
Hats for bats.

141
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.128
Yeah. What's your handicap?

142
00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:55.798
Keep bats warm.

143
00:11:58.301 --> 00:11:59.510
Gracias.

144
00:12:01.304 --> 00:12:03.722
Whoa, amigo, I...

145
00:12:03.807 --> 00:12:05.474
You can't...

146
00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.478
You're welcome.

147
00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:29.706
This is the guy
that wasn't invited to the camp.


148
00:12:29.791 --> 00:12:31.667
Let's take his ass out.

149
00:12:58.736 --> 00:13:00.863
Shit! I've been cut already?

150
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.122
Who the hell is that?

151
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:31.018
Get him a uniform.

152
00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:33.228
All right.
Did you get enough hay for him?


153
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:36.607
You sure?
Take good care of it, all right? All right.


154
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.986
Hey, Jake. How's the knees holding up?

155
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.488
Great. Never been better.

156
00:13:42.572 --> 00:13:45.324
Mobility's good? No problem
getting off the throw to second?


157
00:13:45.408 --> 00:13:46.533
No problemo.

158
00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:47.910
I need a catcher, Jake,

159
00:13:47.994 --> 00:13:50.162
somebody who can lead this team
on the field.


160
00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:53.749
So, I want the absolute truth here.
Are you 100%?


161
00:13:53.875 --> 00:13:55.792
Yeah. Would I bullshit you
about something like that?


162
00:13:55.877 --> 00:13:58.587
You better,
if you wanna make this team.


163
00:14:01.424 --> 00:14:02.841
Second base!

164
00:14:05.595 --> 00:14:06.720
Shit.

165
00:14:29.994 --> 00:14:31.745
Hold it. Hold it.

166
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.918
Well, you may run like Mays,
but you hit like shit.


167
00:14:38.002 --> 00:14:40.546
With your speed,
you should hit the ball on the ground


168
00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.755
and be legging them out.

169
00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.550
Every time I see you
hit one in the air,

170
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.468
you owe me 20 pushups.

171
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.721
Hey, no problem.

172
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:02.276
Shit.

173
00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:09.074
All right, Vaughn,
they tell us you're a pitcher.


174
00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:11.410
You're sure not much of a dresser.

175
00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:14.454
We wear caps and sleeves
at this level, son.


176
00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:16.415
Understood?

177
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.335
All right, let's see what you can do.

178
00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:33.181
-Nice velocity.
-Sounded like it.


179
00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:34.516
Jesus.

180
00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.102
How much?

181
00:15:38.021 --> 00:15:39.563
96.

182
00:15:40.523 --> 00:15:44.359
Better teach this kid some control
before he kills somebody.


183
00:15:46.529 --> 00:15:49.197
Come on, Dorn.
Get in front of the damn ball.


184
00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:51.658
Don't give me this olé bullshit.

185
00:15:51.743 --> 00:15:53.285
Look, I took one of those
in the eye last year.


186
00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:54.620
I'm not about to lose my sight.

187
00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:57.456
I'm deeply moved.
Every time you play one off your hips,


188
00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.374
you owe me 40 sit-ups.

189
00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:00.709
What?

190
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.692
Jesus. This guy hits a ton.

191
00:16:25.777 --> 00:16:28.153
How come nobody else
picked up on him?


192
00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:31.740
Okay, Eddie, that's enough fastballs.
Throw him some breaking balls.


193
00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.752
Lou, I want a word with you here.

194
00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:46.254
Sure.

195
00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.635
About those sit-ups you want me to do,

196
00:16:51.719 --> 00:16:54.346
I got it right here in my contract.
Says I don't have to do any calisthenics


197
00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:58.100
I don't feel are necessary.
So, what do you think about that?


198
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.492
Two hundred pushups. How am I
supposed to hit if I can't lift my arms?


199
00:17:15.576 --> 00:17:16.868
Shit.

200
00:17:16.953 --> 00:17:17.994
The way I played today,

201
00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:20.205
I wouldn't be surprised
if they red-tagged me already.


202
00:17:20.289 --> 00:17:21.540
What do you mean?

203
00:17:21.624 --> 00:17:24.209
You get a red tag on your locker,
it means the manager wants to see you


204
00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:27.546
because you just died
and went down to the minors.


205
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.804
Hey, don't worry, kid.

206
00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:38.724
They ain't gonna cut anybody
the first day.


207
00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:51.528
What's that shit on your chest?

208
00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.739
Crisco.

209
00:17:54.949 --> 00:17:56.158
Bardahl.

210
00:17:57.368 --> 00:17:58.368
Vagisil.

211
00:17:58.453 --> 00:17:59.619
Any one of 'em will give you

212
00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:02.080
another 2 to 3 inches drop
on your curve ball.


213
00:18:02.165 --> 00:18:04.082
'Course, if the umps
are watching me close,


214
00:18:04.167 --> 00:18:07.085
I just rub a little jalapeño
inside my nose, get it running.


215
00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:09.129
Then if I need to
load the ball up a little,

216
00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.131
I just wipe my nose.

217
00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.384
You put snot on the ball?

218
00:18:15.178 --> 00:18:19.431
I haven't got an arm like yours.
I gotta put anything on it I can find.


219
00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.017
Someday you will, too.

220
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:47.083
Qué pasa there, Pedro?

221
00:18:48.795 --> 00:18:51.046
Bats, they are sick.

222
00:18:51.798 --> 00:18:53.465
I can no hit curve ball.

223
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.967
Straight ball, 
I hit it very much.

224
00:18:56.469 --> 00:18:59.137
Curve ball, bats are afraid.

225
00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:05.393
I ask Jobu to
come, take fear from bats.

226
00:19:06.187 --> 00:19:09.356
I offer him cigar and rum.

227
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:12.651
He will come.

228
00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:14.319
Hey, you know, you might think about

229
00:19:14.403 --> 00:19:16.112
taking Jesus Christ as your savior,

230
00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:18.615
instead of fooling around
with all this stuff.


231
00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:20.867
Shit, Harris.

232
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:26.289
Jesus. I like him very much,

233
00:19:27.124 --> 00:19:29.584
but he no help with curve ball.

234
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:32.587
You trying to say
Jesus Christ can't hit a curve ball?


235
00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:35.590
Okay, Harris.
Let's not start a holy war here.


236
00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:41.513
I wouldn't leave that rum sitting around
out here with this group.


237
00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:47.769
Is very bad to steal Jobu's rum.

238
00:19:53.317 --> 00:19:54.734
Is very bad.

239
00:20:01.659 --> 00:20:03.285
Sí, sí, Pedro.

240
00:20:32.398 --> 00:20:35.233
Attaboy, Dorn.
Way to get in front of that ball.


241
00:20:35.318 --> 00:20:37.152
That's the ticket.

242
00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:05.138
Gracias.

243
00:21:06.557 --> 00:21:07.807
Okay.

244
00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:23.406
Third base.

245
00:21:30.748 --> 00:21:32.165
-Shit.
-Jesus!


246
00:21:34.251 --> 00:21:35.710
He's safe!

247
00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:41.508
Damn!

248
00:21:46.305 --> 00:21:47.806
Jeez!

249
00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:51.393
He's going.

250
00:21:54.522 --> 00:21:56.940
-Come on.
-Out!


251
00:22:01.362 --> 00:22:04.698
-Final cut-down day, right?
-Afraid so.


252
00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.158
I don't wanna go in there.

253
00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:09.035
Yeah. Look, whatever happens,

254
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.163
you just keep it to yourselves
until you get out of the clubhouse.


255
00:22:12.248 --> 00:22:15.792
You don't wanna celebrate
in front of guys who just died.


256
00:22:16.127 --> 00:22:19.421
Yeah, but what if
we're one of the deceased, huh?


257
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.596
Come on, Jake, it's only your life.

258
00:23:49.345 --> 00:23:50.512
Yes, yes, yes.

259
00:24:15.913 --> 00:24:18.998
I got news for you, Mr. Brown.
You haven't heard the last of me.


260
00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:20.500
You may think I'm shit now,

261
00:24:20.584 --> 00:24:23.253
but someday,
you're gonna be sorry that you cut me.


262
00:24:23.337 --> 00:24:24.546
I'm gonna catch on somewhere else,

263
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.798
and every time that I pitch against you,

264
00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:29.759
I'm gonna stick it up your fucking ass!

265
00:24:32.096 --> 00:24:35.140
Good. I like that kind of spirit
in a player.


266
00:24:35.599 --> 00:24:38.309
The only problem is I didn't cut you.

267
00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:39.394
What?

268
00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:42.564
I think someone's been
having some fun with you.


269
00:24:48.988 --> 00:24:50.029
Jesus.

270
00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:55.410
Hey, hey, hey!

271
00:24:57.913 --> 00:24:59.038
Vaughn!

272
00:25:00.624 --> 00:25:02.417
Come on, guys! Cool it!

273
00:25:02.501 --> 00:25:04.002
-Don't fuck with me, Vaughn!
-Yeah?


274
00:25:04.086 --> 00:25:05.086
Fuck you!

275
00:25:05.171 --> 00:25:07.505
What's the matter, rookie fuckwad,
can't you take a little joke?


276
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.133
Oh, yeah. Real fucking funny, asshole!

277
00:25:10.217 --> 00:25:13.011
All right. All right! 
Knock that shit off!

278
00:25:14.096 --> 00:25:16.347
Lou, you better make it real clear
to this little lady,


279
00:25:16.432 --> 00:25:18.600
I'm not about to take his shit.

280
00:25:18.726 --> 00:25:20.435
Shut up, Dorn.

281
00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:23.104
Save all that energy for the field.

282
00:25:23.189 --> 00:25:26.191
Got a long way to go
before the season's over.


283
00:25:29.445 --> 00:25:32.739
Hey, forget about Dorn.
We got other things to do.


284
00:25:32.948 --> 00:25:34.324
Like what?

285
00:25:35.576 --> 00:25:37.911
Like packing for Cleveland.

286
00:25:39.788 --> 00:25:41.080
Come on.

287
00:25:56.597 --> 00:25:59.015
Ricky Vaughn? Willie Hayes?

288
00:25:59.892 --> 00:26:02.018
I never heard of most of 'em.

289
00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:04.437
Mitchell Friedman?

290
00:26:05.648 --> 00:26:07.398
Who are these fucking guys?

291
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.920
Two down. Bottom of the ninth.

292
00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:31.089
Game is tied.

293
00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:33.925
Taylor calls his shot.

294
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.472
There's the pitch.

295
00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:08.501
Yeah!

296
00:27:09.086 --> 00:27:12.630
Whoo! Oh, boy!
Oh, you really got a hold of that one.


297
00:27:13.007 --> 00:27:15.216
Yeah. What was that, a slider?

298
00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:18.303
It was out of here.

299
00:27:32.192 --> 00:27:34.444
Are you gentlemen ready to order?

300
00:27:34.528 --> 00:27:37.363
Oh, we'll need a few
minutes more, please.


301
00:27:44.747 --> 00:27:46.873
I look like a banker in this.

302
00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:50.543
Sorry, Rick, those are the house rules.

303
00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:53.379
So, what are we gonna have?

304
00:27:53.464 --> 00:27:55.256
What language is this?

305
00:27:55.424 --> 00:27:56.591
French.

306
00:27:57.092 --> 00:27:59.218
They got chilidogs over there?

307
00:27:59.303 --> 00:28:02.221
Forget it, I'll order. 
Let's have a toast.

308
00:28:05.684 --> 00:28:07.435
Here's to baseball,

309
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:10.396
and to the start of two great careers.

310
00:28:11.357 --> 00:28:12.857
And for me,

311
00:28:13.275 --> 00:28:16.027
here's to one more good year
in the sun.


312
00:28:37.633 --> 00:28:39.801
What is it, the chick?

313
00:28:40.177 --> 00:28:43.513
-That's my wife.
-Does she know that?


314
00:28:43.847 --> 00:28:45.973
I mean, she would have been,
if I hadn't messed it up.


315
00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:47.183
Who's that guy she's with?

316
00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:49.852
I don't know.
He's not wearing a name tag.


317
00:28:49.937 --> 00:28:53.815
You want me to drag him out of here,
kick the shit out of him?


318
00:28:58.821 --> 00:28:59.862
Excuse me.

319
00:28:59.947 --> 00:29:02.573
Miss Westland, there's
a telephone call for you at the desk.


320
00:29:02.658 --> 00:29:04.450
Oh, okay, thank you.

321
00:29:05.035 --> 00:29:07.662
That's strange. 
I'll be right back.

322
00:29:13.293 --> 00:29:16.712
-Hello?
-Hello, Lynn? It's Jake.


323
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:19.632
Jake.

324
00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:22.135
-Jake Taylor?
-Uh-huh.


325
00:29:24.012 --> 00:29:25.555
How'd you know I was here?

326
00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:27.390
Oh, just a hunch.

327
00:29:28.016 --> 00:29:31.436
I took you there when you
got your master's degree, remember?


328
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.231
I figured you're wearing that black dress
with the red sash.


329
00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:39.861
How'd you know that?
I didn't even have this dress when...


330
00:29:46.952 --> 00:29:49.495
You're still a stunner.

331
00:29:50.205 --> 00:29:51.414
Thanks.

332
00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:55.626
What are you doing here?

333
00:29:55.711 --> 00:29:58.004
Aren't you supposed to be
in Mexico somewhere?


334
00:29:58.088 --> 00:30:00.923
Well, I'm playing with the Indians again.
Back in the bigs.


335
00:30:01.008 --> 00:30:04.510
Well, that's great.
That's great, Jake. I'm happy for you.


336
00:30:04.595 --> 00:30:08.181
Lynn, I don't think he's gonna buy
the phone bit now.


337
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.188
I... I gotta get back.

338
00:30:15.522 --> 00:30:16.898
Wait a minute. 
I need your number.

339
00:30:16.982 --> 00:30:19.150
I tried calling you at home,
but you're not listed.


340
00:30:19.234 --> 00:30:21.319
My life is different
from when you knew me, Jake.


341
00:30:21.403 --> 00:30:23.362
Meaning what,
I don't know you anymore?


342
00:30:23.447 --> 00:30:24.780
Couldn't we talk about this
some other time?


343
00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:26.741
-I really gotta get back.
-Okay. Just give me the number.


344
00:30:26.825 --> 00:30:29.243
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-Why? 'Cause of this guy you're with?


345
00:30:29.328 --> 00:30:31.746
-What is he, an accountant?
-Attorney.


346
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:35.124
-Oh, worse.
-Please. He's watching us.


347
00:30:35.209 --> 00:30:38.252
I'm not leaving
till you give me your number.


348
00:30:39.755 --> 00:30:43.758
All right. It's 555-1934.

349
00:30:44.218 --> 00:30:45.551
Thank you.

350
00:30:46.553 --> 00:30:47.637
Lynn.

351
00:30:49.348 --> 00:30:51.807
I'm back. I'm gonna be around.

352
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.229
Relax, kid.
We got 162 of these games to go.


353
00:31:44.653 --> 00:31:45.987
All right, everybody.

354
00:31:46.071 --> 00:31:49.657
We got 10 minutes to game time.
Let's all gather round.


355
00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:57.456
I'm not much
for giving inspirational addresses,


356
00:31:57.749 --> 00:32:02.003
but I'd just like to point out
that every newspaper in the country


357
00:32:02.129 --> 00:32:04.505
has picked us to finish last.

358
00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:09.760
The local press seems to think
we'd save everyone


359
00:32:09.845 --> 00:32:12.138
a lot of time and trouble

360
00:32:12.222 --> 00:32:15.057
if we just went out and shot ourselves.

361
00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:18.394
Me? I'm for wasting sportswriters' time.

362
00:32:18.645 --> 00:32:20.855
So, I'd like to hang around

363
00:32:20.981 --> 00:32:24.900
and see if we can give 'em all
a nice big shit-burger to eat.


364
00:32:27.195 --> 00:32:29.196
Shit-burger?

365
00:32:29.865 --> 00:32:31.157
Hey, Lou.

366
00:32:32.993 --> 00:32:35.369
Aren't we gonna have a prayer?

367
00:32:35.495 --> 00:32:39.206
I mean, we're not all savages
like Cerrano over there.


368
00:32:42.044 --> 00:32:43.794
You guys go ahead.

369
00:32:43.879 --> 00:32:45.880
Oh, well, okay. Let's...

370
00:32:47.257 --> 00:32:50.801
-Let's all bow our heads.
-Excuse me. I'll be in my office.


371
00:32:53.472 --> 00:32:57.099
Dear Heavenly Father,
we humbly pray that you will guide...


372
00:32:59.019 --> 00:33:01.187
Jesus Christ, Cerrano.

373
00:33:01.271 --> 00:33:03.064
Have to wake up bats.

374
00:33:03.607 --> 00:33:06.150
Okay. Shit, can we try this again?

375
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:13.574
Dear God, we humbly pray
that you will guide and protect us


376
00:33:13.659 --> 00:33:16.452
as we gird up our loins
to take the field of battle.


377
00:33:16.536 --> 00:33:19.747
Lead us all into victory
in the name of Jesus...


378
00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:22.500
Christ.

379
00:33:24.294 --> 00:33:26.545
-Way to go, Cerrano.
-God damn it.


380
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:28.756
-Jesus.
-Let's go. Go.


381
00:33:34.763 --> 00:33:35.805
Hello again, everybody.

382
00:33:35.889 --> 00:33:38.933
Harry Doyle here, welcoming all you
friends of the feather


383
00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:41.477
to another season of Indians baseball.

384
00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:44.563
A lot of new faces in Chief Wahoo's
tribe this year


385
00:33:44.648 --> 00:33:46.899
as they take on the defending
American League champs,


386
00:33:46.983 --> 00:33:48.275
the New York Yankees.

387
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.903
And hopefully, we'll have some
of the names that go with those faces


388
00:33:50.987 --> 00:33:52.488
before their first at-bat.

389
00:33:52.572 --> 00:33:56.951
Anyway, listen to the roar of the crowd
as the Indians take the field.


390
00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:08.504
Yes, sir,
they love this club here in Cleveland.


391
00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.674
Just a reminder, fans,
about Die Hard Night


392
00:34:11.758 --> 00:34:12.967
coming up here at the stadium.

393
00:34:13.051 --> 00:34:15.803
Free admission to anyone
who was actually alive


394
00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:18.806
the last time the Indians won a pennant.

395
00:34:21.393 --> 00:34:24.103
Here's to the thrill of defeat, Charlie.

396
00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.275
Keltner delivers. Here's a swing,
and a high fly ball to center field.


397
00:34:29.484 --> 00:34:30.568
Hayes under it.

398
00:34:30.652 --> 00:34:33.738
Hey. Makes a basket catch,
Willie Mays style.


399
00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:35.531
And the side is retired.

400
00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.243
All right. Way to look out there. Great.

401
00:34:39.327 --> 00:34:42.663
Nice catch, Hayes.
Don't ever fucking do it again.


402
00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:45.750
-All right. Let's go! Let's get it going!
-Let's go.


403
00:34:45.959 --> 00:34:48.002
Bottom of the first,
and Willie Mays Hayes


404
00:34:48.086 --> 00:34:50.004
to lead it off for the wigwammers.

405
00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:52.673
A lot of people say you can tell
how the season's gonna go


406
00:34:52.758 --> 00:34:54.300
by the first hitter of the year.

407
00:34:54.384 --> 00:34:56.677
Brewster into the wind,
and comes to the plate.


408
00:34:57.012 --> 00:34:58.137
Oops!

409
00:34:58.221 --> 00:34:59.972
Hey! Here's a hot shot toward the hole.

410
00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:03.893
Rudiya knocks it down, fires to first.
Late! Hayes beat it!


411
00:35:05.687 --> 00:35:09.607
Hey, give Rudiya credit
for sacrificing his body on that racket.


412
00:35:09.691 --> 00:35:11.442
That guy's got a family to think about.

413
00:35:11.526 --> 00:35:14.361
So, Hayes becomes
the first Indian in 15 years


414
00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:15.863
to lead off the season with a hit.

415
00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.157
Really knocked the crap out of that one.

416
00:35:18.241 --> 00:35:20.451
Oh, I plan to get
at least a double out of this.


417
00:35:20.577 --> 00:35:24.079
I bought 100 of these,
one for every base I'm gonna steal.


418
00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:25.122
Shit.

419
00:35:25.207 --> 00:35:28.292
Well, maybe things will turn around
a little for the Indians this year.


420
00:35:28.376 --> 00:35:30.544
Now batting, number seven,
catcher Jake Taylor.


421
00:35:30.629 --> 00:35:33.881
Excuse me. Gotta take my first step
toward the Hall of Fame.


422
00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:34.965
My ass.

423
00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:37.176
We don't know where Hayes
played last year,


424
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.386
but I'm sure he did
a hell of a job.

425
00:35:39.471 --> 00:35:42.807
Brewster ready from the stretch.
Hayes with a good lead.


426
00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:45.184
You look real sharp,
but it's hard to steal second base


427
00:35:45.268 --> 00:35:47.102
with your shoe untied.

428
00:35:47.187 --> 00:35:49.647
Quick move to first. He got him!

429
00:35:49.731 --> 00:35:51.565
Hayes is picked off.

430
00:35:55.695 --> 00:35:56.862
Well, so much for that.

431
00:35:56.947 --> 00:36:00.074
Personally, I think we got hosed
on that call.


432
00:36:06.706 --> 00:36:10.084
Nice going. Don't bounce the damn ball.

433
00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:13.254
Nice throw, dickhead.

434
00:36:15.382 --> 00:36:16.632
Strike.

435
00:36:16.967 --> 00:36:18.425
Son of a bitch!

436
00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.135
Coming through! I...

437
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.847
Oh, shit!

438
00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:28.519
Top of the sixth, and rookie sensation
Ricky Vaughn on the pitch now.


439
00:36:28.603 --> 00:36:32.356
You can close the book on Keltner.
Thank God.


440
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.024
Relax, rookie.
We're only four runs down.


441
00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:35.192
We're still in this game.

442
00:36:35.277 --> 00:36:36.402
You take it to 'em.

443
00:36:36.486 --> 00:36:37.695
-Let's go.
-All right.


444
00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:40.281
Look, man, a guy gets to second,
first sign indicator.


445
00:36:40.448 --> 00:36:42.950
Vaughn, a juvenile delinquent
in the off-season,


446
00:36:43.034 --> 00:36:44.535
in his major league debut.

447
00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:47.121
I'm gonna light your ass up, meat.

448
00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:52.543
Vaughn into the wind-up
in his first offering.


449
00:36:53.128 --> 00:36:56.672
Just a bit outside.
He tried the corner and missed.


450
00:36:58.049 --> 00:37:00.301
Ball four. Ball eight.

451
00:37:01.887 --> 00:37:04.346
Low, and Vaughn has walked
the bases loaded


452
00:37:04.431 --> 00:37:05.931
on 12 straight pitches.

453
00:37:06.016 --> 00:37:08.142
Boy, how can these guys
lay off pitches that close?


454
00:37:08.226 --> 00:37:09.226
Fuck!

455
00:37:12.314 --> 00:37:15.107
Wild thing

456
00:37:15.358 --> 00:37:17.359
You make my heart sing

457
00:37:19.154 --> 00:37:21.280
You walk everything

458
00:37:23.158 --> 00:37:24.742
Taylor, what are you doing
back up here?


459
00:37:24.826 --> 00:37:27.745
I couldn't cut it in the Mexican League.

460
00:37:28.121 --> 00:37:30.247
How's your wife and my kids?

461
00:37:30.332 --> 00:37:33.083
Vaughn in deep trouble here
with Clue Haywood,


462
00:37:33.168 --> 00:37:36.587
last year's American League
home-run champ at the plate.


463
00:37:36.671 --> 00:37:38.422
Vaughn kicks, fires.

464
00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:42.551
Here is a swing, and a drive
toward left field, and deep. Oh, boy.


465
00:37:42.636 --> 00:37:45.304
No way. No way. Too high. Too high.

466
00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:48.390
It is gone off the reservation.

467
00:37:48.475 --> 00:37:51.185
A grand-slam home run for Haywood.

468
00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.604
Looked like a strike, anyway.

469
00:37:53.688 --> 00:37:54.772
Where are you going?

470
00:37:54.856 --> 00:37:56.440
"Too high"?
What does that mean, "too high"?


471
00:37:56.524 --> 00:37:58.108
Too high, I thought.

472
00:37:58.193 --> 00:38:00.402
So, Vaughn is off to a rocky start,

473
00:38:00.487 --> 00:38:03.280
as Haywood clears the bases
with one swing.


474
00:38:03.365 --> 00:38:05.115
Not "too high," "too hard," right?

475
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.202
-At first, it was really high.
-Who gives a shit? It's gone.


476
00:38:10.872 --> 00:38:14.166
-Want me to go get him?
-Nah. Let's see how he reacts.


477
00:38:14.334 --> 00:38:16.835
Well, Brown, apparently,
is going to stay with Vaughn here,


478
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.713
as the Indians trail now,
eight to nothing.


479
00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:23.509
Coleman steps in. 
A .281 lifetime hitter.

480
00:38:23.593 --> 00:38:27.179
Taylor with a sign,
Vaughn into his motion, and the pitch.


481
00:38:27.931 --> 00:38:28.973
Uh-oh!

482
00:38:29.057 --> 00:38:30.516
Interesting.

483
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.600
About time, it's eight-nothing.

484
00:38:31.685 --> 00:38:33.268
You! You're gone!

485
00:38:33.395 --> 00:38:35.771
-What?
-You heard me, you're gone!


486
00:38:35.855 --> 00:38:37.147
He was right on top of the plate.

487
00:38:37.232 --> 00:38:39.358
Get him out of here!
He's horse shit.


488
00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:41.694
I think you can go get him now.

489
00:38:41.778 --> 00:38:44.071
The ball slipped out of my hand.
It was an accident.


490
00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:45.614
You threw at him intentionally.

491
00:38:45.699 --> 00:38:47.866
-Kiss my ass.
-You're gone.


492
00:38:47.951 --> 00:38:50.494
-You're full of shit! Fuck you!
-Get out of here, rookie!


493
00:38:50.578 --> 00:38:52.329
Why don't you blow me, ump?

494
00:38:52.414 --> 00:38:53.664
You're gone!

495
00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:55.708
All right, Coleman, take it easy.
Accidents will happen.


496
00:38:55.792 --> 00:38:57.626
You show a lot of heart
shaking it off like this.


497
00:38:57.711 --> 00:38:59.044
Fuck you, Taylor.

498
00:38:59.129 --> 00:39:00.879
-He done hurt him, hurt himself!
-Come on!


499
00:39:00.964 --> 00:39:02.965
Don't even think about it, Coleman.

500
00:39:03.258 --> 00:39:05.884
The fucking wall, you pansy!

501
00:39:06.928 --> 00:39:07.928
Hard and high.

502
00:39:08.013 --> 00:39:10.681
They succeeded at getting the object
that they were trying to establish.


503
00:39:10.765 --> 00:39:13.350
Because of the trajectory of the ball,
it looked way too high.


504
00:39:15.145 --> 00:39:17.688
So, a tough start for the Erie warriors,

505
00:39:17.772 --> 00:39:21.692
as they drop a heartbreaker
to the Yankees, nine to nothing.


506
00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:24.319
Post-game show is brought to you by...

507
00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:29.450
Christ, I can't find it. 
The hell with it.

508
00:39:31.494 --> 00:39:33.620
Hello. Cuyahoga Sheet Metal.

509
00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:37.291
Yeah, you wouldn't happen to have
someone working there


510
00:39:37.459 --> 00:39:39.543
named Lynn Westland, would you?

511
00:39:39.627 --> 00:39:41.545
Nah, nobody here by that name.

512
00:39:41.629 --> 00:39:43.297
Didn't think so.

513
00:40:08.573 --> 00:40:09.948
Jake, you shouldn't have come here.

514
00:40:10.033 --> 00:40:11.742
I was wondering
why you'd give an old friend


515
00:40:11.826 --> 00:40:13.869
a bum phone number.

516
00:40:14.162 --> 00:40:17.331
-Let's talk in my office, okay?
-I don't wanna talk in your office.


517
00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:19.666
I told you, I don't think it's a good idea
that we see each other.


518
00:40:19.751 --> 00:40:20.751
Why not?

519
00:40:20.835 --> 00:40:22.002
Because we don't have
anything in common.


520
00:40:22.087 --> 00:40:23.504
Sometimes I wonder if we ever did.

521
00:40:23.588 --> 00:40:24.922
What are you talking about?

522
00:40:25.006 --> 00:40:27.508
We were both athletes, world-class,
hot for each other.


523
00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:28.926
What more could we have in common?

524
00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.969
I stopped being an athlete
three years ago, Jake.


525
00:40:31.054 --> 00:40:32.930
Books are my life now.

526
00:40:34.516 --> 00:40:36.308
Don't you dare laugh.
In two years, I put together


527
00:40:36.392 --> 00:40:38.644
one of the best special collection
departments in the country.


528
00:40:38.728 --> 00:40:42.189
What is this? You're still sore
I never read Moby Dick?


529
00:40:42.524 --> 00:40:44.525
You never read anything I asked you to.

530
00:40:44.609 --> 00:40:47.027
All right, I'll check it out now.
Is this the whale section?


531
00:40:47.112 --> 00:40:49.029
I'll bet what's-his-name at the restaurant
read it.


532
00:40:49.114 --> 00:40:50.656
Tom. His name's Tom,
and keep your voice down.


533
00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:51.990
What do you see in this guy?

534
00:40:52.075 --> 00:40:53.784
Well, he's stable, intelligent,

535
00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:55.869
and I never found him in bed
with a stewardess.


536
00:40:55.954 --> 00:40:57.496
That's because no stewardess
would have him.


537
00:40:57.580 --> 00:40:59.623
Hey, wouldn't you rather be
with someone who's in demand?


538
00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:01.458
Oh, God, you know, Jake,
it's just like always.


539
00:41:01.543 --> 00:41:03.669
You don't take anything seriously.
Everything's a joke to you.


540
00:41:03.753 --> 00:41:06.964
Oh, come on, man, for Christ's sake.
I'm just trying to loosen things up.


541
00:41:07.048 --> 00:41:09.216
I'm getting frostbite here.

542
00:41:09.717 --> 00:41:12.719
Tom and I
are getting married in the fall.


543
00:41:13.388 --> 00:41:16.056
Oh, God, Lynn, that's crazy.
I had plans for us.


544
00:41:16.182 --> 00:41:17.266
-Plans?
-Yeah.


545
00:41:17.392 --> 00:41:19.059
How can you say stuff like that?

546
00:41:19.144 --> 00:41:22.146
I haven't seen you in three years.
You never even wrote me a letter.


547
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.313
Well, I'm sorry about that,

548
00:41:23.398 --> 00:41:25.023
but I wasn't exactly proud
of my situation.


549
00:41:25.108 --> 00:41:26.859
Come on, you never thought
about me at all while I was gone?


550
00:41:26.943 --> 00:41:28.485
Yeah, Jake, not so loud.

551
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.696
What about the three nights we spent
on the beach in Veracruz?


552
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.156
You ever have nights like that
with Mr. Briefcase?


553
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.700
What about the night you had in Detroit
with Miss Fuel Injection?


554
00:41:34.784 --> 00:41:35.784
Well, what was I supposed to do?

555
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.494
She bet me 50 bucks
she had a better body than you,


556
00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:38.620
and I had to defend your honor.

557
00:41:38.705 --> 00:41:39.788
Oh, what a bunch of bullshit!

558
00:41:39.873 --> 00:41:42.916
I have a much better body
than she does!


559
00:41:48.506 --> 00:41:49.631
She's right.

560
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:53.177
You haven't changed at all, have you?

561
00:41:53.261 --> 00:41:54.928
I'm afraid I have,
or I wouldn't be here.

562
00:41:55.013 --> 00:41:58.265
Come on, Lynn. Don't make me do time
for things that happened years ago.


563
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.516
Jake, I'm sorry.

564
00:41:59.601 --> 00:42:03.103
You'll just always be the little boy
who wouldn't grow up.


565
00:42:03.188 --> 00:42:04.271
Lynn.

566
00:42:08.443 --> 00:42:11.236
A quarter of the season's gone.
We're 15 and 24.


567
00:42:11.321 --> 00:42:12.821
Seven games out of first.

568
00:42:12.906 --> 00:42:14.448
That's bad. It's not bad enough.

569
00:42:14.532 --> 00:42:17.743
Plus, this team is showing
signs of improvement.


570
00:42:17.911 --> 00:42:20.204
I didn't think we'd win

571
00:42:20.288 --> 00:42:22.748
-Any ideas?
-On how we can get worse?


572
00:42:24.125 --> 00:42:26.376
How about a series of fines
for good play?


573
00:42:26.461 --> 00:42:30.380
Maybe a $30,000 bonus for the guy
voted least valuable player.


574
00:42:32.842 --> 00:42:34.760
Maybe the problem is

575
00:42:36.137 --> 00:42:38.555
we're coddling these guys too much.

576
00:42:39.474 --> 00:42:40.557
Yeah.

577
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:49.816
What's with this?
We never leave from down here.


578
00:42:49.901 --> 00:42:52.194
Maybe the Jetway isn't working.

579
00:42:54.072 --> 00:42:56.198
Hey, this is good. 
This is real good.

580
00:42:56.282 --> 00:42:57.699
A 757 to Milwaukee?

581
00:42:57.784 --> 00:43:01.620
No, that's not your plane.
Yours is this one rolling in.


582
00:43:17.053 --> 00:43:20.180
Oh, sure, now you come around.

583
00:43:20.515 --> 00:43:21.682
He's not fooled.

584
00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:26.937
So, the sons of Geronimo,
still suffering from propeller-lag,


585
00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:29.856
are nipped by the Brewers tonight,
seven to nothing.


586
00:43:29.941 --> 00:43:32.317
The only excitement for the tribe
provided by Rick Vaughn,


587
00:43:32.402 --> 00:43:34.152
who set an American League record

588
00:43:34.237 --> 00:43:36.488
by throwing four wild pitches
in one inning.


589
00:43:36.572 --> 00:43:38.365
Hey, congratulations, Rick.

590
00:43:38.449 --> 00:43:41.660
Excuse me, Mr. Vaughn?
Can I have your autograph?


591
00:43:41.869 --> 00:43:43.245
Yeah, sure.

592
00:43:44.664 --> 00:43:45.956
My first autograph.

593
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.958
Couldn't give these away
a couple of weeks ago.


594
00:43:48.084 --> 00:43:51.920
I saw your record on the news.
You made their Hall of Shame.


595
00:43:52.005 --> 00:43:53.630
Congratulations.

596
00:43:53.756 --> 00:43:56.174
-Thanks.
-Hey, thank you.


597
00:43:58.011 --> 00:43:59.803
Nice hair.

598
00:44:00.013 --> 00:44:02.389
Well, you're a celebrity now, Vaughn.

599
00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:04.975
Thought you had to do something good
to be a celebrity.


600
00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:06.518
Not if you do it colorfully.

601
00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:13.317
Call the stewardess, Vaughn.
I need one of those bags.


602
00:44:13.401 --> 00:44:15.902
There aren't any stewardesses.

603
00:44:16.195 --> 00:44:18.655
I wonder if there are any pilots.

604
00:44:21.826 --> 00:44:24.077
So, the tribe drops
its third straight on this trip.


605
00:44:24.162 --> 00:44:25.871
Six to one to the Rangers.

606
00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:29.249
For the Indians, one run on,
let's see, one hit.


607
00:44:29.667 --> 00:44:32.085
That's all we got, one goddamn hit?

608
00:44:32.879 --> 00:44:34.588
You can't say "goddamn" on the air.

609
00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:37.174
Don't worry, nobody's listening anyway.

610
00:44:37.258 --> 00:44:40.052
Hey, Mort, what is Comtec at?

611
00:44:41.596 --> 00:44:43.472
Buy it when it hits 34.

612
00:44:45.058 --> 00:44:46.058
What?

613
00:44:46.142 --> 00:44:48.101
Moby Dick? What you reading that for?

614
00:44:49.937 --> 00:44:53.774
This happens to be a masterpiece
of American literature, that's why.


615
00:44:53.858 --> 00:44:55.400
Lynn turned you on to that?

616
00:44:55.485 --> 00:44:57.611
Yeah, a long time ago.

617
00:44:57.695 --> 00:44:59.029
Well, look, if we
ever get out of here,

618
00:44:59.113 --> 00:45:01.406
me and the guys, we're gonna
go to a club later on tonight.


619
00:45:01.491 --> 00:45:03.116
Wanna come along?

620
00:45:03.326 --> 00:45:05.952
Well, I... I got some reading to do.

621
00:45:06.037 --> 00:45:07.454
What, you got a test or something?

622
00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:09.581
Hey, Jake, man, why don't you
just go over there and see her?


623
00:45:09.665 --> 00:45:11.625
I mean, maybe she'll let you slide
on a couple of these.


624
00:45:11.709 --> 00:45:14.002
Well, I would, if
I knew where she lived.

625
00:45:14.087 --> 00:45:17.172
That's easy.
Just tail her home from the library.


626
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.675
What, do you mean sit in the car
and wait for her to come out?


627
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:23.595
-That's kinda juvenile, don't you think?
-Yeah.


628
00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.983
Jake, this isn't my place.

629
00:47:00.067 --> 00:47:02.611
-Who is this, love?
-Whose is it?


630
00:47:03.196 --> 00:47:05.238
Oh, Mr. Taylor, right?

631
00:47:06.324 --> 00:47:08.325
I remember you from the restaurant.

632
00:47:08.409 --> 00:47:10.660
Lynn's told me a lot about you.

633
00:47:11.704 --> 00:47:13.914
Why don't you come in for a while?

634
00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:16.124
Oh, no.
I really ought to be running along.


635
00:47:16.209 --> 00:47:19.002
-Yeah, he's gotta get going.
-Yeah.


636
00:47:19.086 --> 00:47:21.505
Really. Come on in for a drink.

637
00:47:21.756 --> 00:47:22.923
Well...

638
00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.677
Excuse me, everybody.
This is Jake Taylor.


639
00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:30.347
Jake, Arthur and Claire Holloway.

640
00:47:30.431 --> 00:47:31.598
-How do you do?
-Hi.


641
00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:34.017
-Hello.
-Brent and Janice Bowden.


642
00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:35.602
-How do you do?
-Hi. How are you?


643
00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:36.937
Hi.

644
00:47:37.021 --> 00:47:39.523
Jake is a professional baseball player.

645
00:47:39.607 --> 00:47:40.774
Really?

646
00:47:41.734 --> 00:47:44.444
Jake, what brings you here
this evening?


647
00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:48.365
Well, I wanted to discuss
a couple of books with Lynn,


648
00:47:48.449 --> 00:47:51.076
and I thought this was her place.

649
00:47:51.452 --> 00:47:54.204
Well, it soon will be.

650
00:47:55.623 --> 00:47:59.459
Yeah, I heard you were engaged.
Congratulations.


651
00:48:03.923 --> 00:48:05.257
Thank you.

652
00:48:05.341 --> 00:48:09.052
-What can I get you to drink?
-Beer will be fine.


653
00:48:09.136 --> 00:48:10.887
Great. Have a seat.

654
00:48:23.818 --> 00:48:25.944
-That's great.
-Yeah.


655
00:48:26.028 --> 00:48:27.487
-No, thanks.
-Sir.


656
00:48:29.031 --> 00:48:30.031
No.

657
00:48:37.456 --> 00:48:41.084
Well, what team do you play for, Jake?

658
00:48:41.168 --> 00:48:42.627
The Indians.

659
00:48:42.712 --> 00:48:44.546
Here in Cleveland?

660
00:48:44.839 --> 00:48:47.173
I didn't know they still had a team.

661
00:48:47.258 --> 00:48:50.635
Yeah. We got uniforms and everything.
It's really great.


662
00:48:51.846 --> 00:48:56.474
They're in last right now,
but hopefully moving up, eh, Jake?


663
00:49:00.396 --> 00:49:04.482
I've heard baseball players make
very good salaries these days.


664
00:49:05.443 --> 00:49:08.612
Well, that depends on
how good they are, I guess.


665
00:49:08.863 --> 00:49:10.488
How good are you?

666
00:49:12.199 --> 00:49:14.200
I make the league minimum.

667
00:49:16.454 --> 00:49:20.874
He was one of the best in baseball
before he had problems with his knees.


668
00:49:25.546 --> 00:49:29.341
Well, Jake, what are you gonna do
when your career's over?


669
00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:33.094
I mean, you can't play baseball forever,
can you?


670
00:49:33.888 --> 00:49:35.972
Something will come up.

671
00:49:36.599 --> 00:49:38.391
Will it?

672
00:49:40.728 --> 00:49:43.063
Well, I thought I'd go to Hawaii,

673
00:49:44.023 --> 00:49:46.441
have a couple of kids who grow up
to be Olympic champions.


674
00:49:47.401 --> 00:49:50.070
Really? In what event?

675
00:49:50.571 --> 00:49:51.738
Swimming.

676
00:49:53.407 --> 00:49:55.116
The 200-meter individual medley.

677
00:49:55.201 --> 00:49:57.661
I figure it ought to
be real big by then.

678
00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:59.162
You got the girl picked out?

679
00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:02.749
I did, but I wasn't smart enough
to hold on to her.


680
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.380
You used to be an athlete,
didn't you, Lynn?


681
00:50:08.464 --> 00:50:09.798
Yeah.

682
00:50:09.882 --> 00:50:12.217
What did you do?

683
00:50:13.803 --> 00:50:16.304
200-meter individual medley.

684
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.397
Alternate on the '80 Olympic team.

685
00:50:26.107 --> 00:50:28.942
Oh, really? Well...

686
00:50:32.947 --> 00:50:34.739
Well, I better get going.

687
00:50:34.824 --> 00:50:36.366
Oh, let me walk you out.

688
00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.952
-Nice meeting all of you.
-Yeah.


689
00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:44.457
-Thanks for the beer.
-Don't mention it.


690
00:50:44.542 --> 00:50:47.377
I'll let you know if I land a job.
I know you're very concerned.


691
00:50:47.503 --> 00:50:49.754
Yeah, well, I

692
00:50:50.548 --> 00:50:54.342
just wanted Lynn to know
what she would have had ahead of her.


693
00:50:55.136 --> 00:50:57.595
-Stay away from her.
-Suck my dick.


694
00:51:08.816 --> 00:51:11.359
-Pepper says you wanted to see me.
-Yeah, Rick.


695
00:51:11.444 --> 00:51:13.653
Come on in. Have a seat.

696
00:51:19.285 --> 00:51:22.203
Rick, I'm not gonna
beat around the bush here.


697
00:51:22.288 --> 00:51:25.582
You've got a great arm.
It's one of the best I've ever seen,


698
00:51:25.666 --> 00:51:29.294
but your control hasn't come around
like we'd hoped it would.


699
00:51:29.503 --> 00:51:31.629
Now, a lot of pitchers started off wild,

700
00:51:31.714 --> 00:51:34.340
and after they worked it out
in the minors for a while,


701
00:51:34.425 --> 00:51:36.426
they went on to great careers.

702
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:38.136
Take Ryan there.

703
00:51:45.144 --> 00:51:47.937
-What about him?
-Never mind Ryan.


704
00:51:56.071 --> 00:51:58.198
Read these letters for me.

705
00:52:02.077 --> 00:52:04.204
You can't read them, can you?

706
00:52:09.168 --> 00:52:12.462
Yo, man, they look nice.
I had a pair just like 'em.


707
00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:16.800
Well, after the game, I'm gonna
pick out a pair that's more me.


708
00:52:16.884 --> 00:52:18.468
-Good luck.
-They look good.


709
00:52:18.552 --> 00:52:21.596
Besides, seeing's
the most important thing, son.


710
00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:24.265
I don't think it's that important.

711
00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:28.603
Fuck.

712
00:52:29.188 --> 00:52:31.815
All right, let's hit the field.

713
00:53:01.929 --> 00:53:03.847
Up your butt, Jobu.

714
00:53:19.113 --> 00:53:22.448
Yo, bartender! 
Jobu needs a refill!

715
00:53:23.117 --> 00:53:25.243
-Head's up!
-Yo, watch it!


716
00:53:25.327 --> 00:53:26.870
Hustle! Let's go!

717
00:53:26.954 --> 00:53:28.580
-God damn!
-Shit.


718
00:53:31.834 --> 00:53:34.043
We're in the ninth.

719
00:53:34.962 --> 00:53:36.254
Two down, a man on first,

720
00:53:36.338 --> 00:53:38.882
and the Indians clinging to
a one-run lead.


721
00:53:38.966 --> 00:53:41.259
Ricky Vaughn,
the kid they call "Wild Thing,"


722
00:53:41.343 --> 00:53:44.512
one out away
from his first major league victory.


723
00:53:45.306 --> 00:53:47.390
Vaughn's been looking good
out there today.


724
00:53:47.474 --> 00:53:49.684
Don't worry, he'll blow it.

725
00:53:49.768 --> 00:53:52.604
Vaughn's showing some signs
of fatigue out there.


726
00:53:52.688 --> 00:53:55.732
He seems to have lost some zip
on his fastball.


727
00:53:55.816 --> 00:53:57.775
Slow curve. Here's a swing,
and a bouncing ball.


728
00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:00.653
Dorn has a chance to make the play.
He can't get it.


729
00:54:00.738 --> 00:54:03.990
Clark digging around second.
He'll make it to third easily.


730
00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:07.201
And the A's have runners at the corners.

731
00:54:07.494 --> 00:54:10.163
Dorn didn't get much of a jump
on that ball, Monte.


732
00:54:10.247 --> 00:54:13.875
But let's give him credit,
at least he didn't spike himself.


733
00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:16.836
You want me to get him
out of there, Lou?


734
00:54:16.921 --> 00:54:17.962
No.

735
00:54:18.047 --> 00:54:20.590
He's come this far,
let's see if he can finish it.


736
00:54:20.674 --> 00:54:22.759
Come on, we need some defense here!

737
00:54:22.843 --> 00:54:25.053
Johnny, maybe we ought to do
one of those waves.


738
00:54:25.137 --> 00:54:28.097
So, Vaughn in a little trouble here.

739
00:54:28.182 --> 00:54:30.099
But I'll tell you,
these Cleveland fans are great.


740
00:54:30.184 --> 00:54:32.352
Listen to them get behind Vaughn.

741
00:54:32.436 --> 00:54:35.104
-Hey, way to go, Rick!
-Go, Rick!


742
00:54:35.189 --> 00:54:38.274
Come on, baby. Come on, Ricky.
Come on, Ricky.


743
00:54:39.526 --> 00:54:42.654
Okay, Ricky, there's two outs,
so forget about the runners.


744
00:54:42.738 --> 00:54:46.032
Get this guy at the plate.
Come on, Rick. Get tough.


745
00:54:46.825 --> 00:54:47.825
This guy's a first-ball hitter.

746
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:49.827
You gotta come up
with something nasty.


747
00:54:49.912 --> 00:54:51.746
Fucking Dorn.
This game should be over by now.


748
00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:54.290
He could have had that ball.
He tanked it on purpose.


749
00:54:54.375 --> 00:54:56.751
This isn't the California Penal League,
Vaughn.


750
00:54:56.835 --> 00:54:58.169
We're professionals here.

751
00:54:58.253 --> 00:54:59.712
We don't tank plays
for personal reasons,


752
00:54:59.797 --> 00:55:01.547
so cut the crybaby shit.

753
00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:04.342
Now, you pitched a hell of a game.
You want to finish it, don't you?


754
00:55:04.426 --> 00:55:06.219
-Yeah.
-All right.


755
00:55:06.637 --> 00:55:08.680
You think you can throw
a strike on this pitch?


756
00:55:08.764 --> 00:55:11.307
There's not gonna be much on it.
My arm feels like Jell-O right now.


757
00:55:11.392 --> 00:55:14.102
Just get it over the plate.
I want him to swing.


758
00:55:14.186 --> 00:55:16.980
Last time I did that,
the guy hit one that hasn't landed yet.


759
00:55:17.064 --> 00:55:18.481
Don't worry about it. 
I'll take care of it.

760
00:55:18.565 --> 00:55:21.275
Number 27, right fielder Mike Rexman.

761
00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.568
Hi, Rexman.

762
00:55:22.653 --> 00:55:24.779
Hell of a situation we got here.
Two on, two out,


763
00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:27.073
you guys trailing by one in the ninth.

764
00:55:27.157 --> 00:55:29.158
You got a chance to be a hero
on national television.


765
00:55:29.243 --> 00:55:30.743
If you don't blow it.

766
00:55:30.828 --> 00:55:32.996
By the way, I saw your wife
at the Capri Lounge last night.


767
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:35.164
Hell of a dancer.
You must be very, very proud.


768
00:55:35.249 --> 00:55:36.332
That guy she was with,

769
00:55:36.417 --> 00:55:38.126
I mean, I'm sure
he's a close personal friend and all,


770
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:39.335
but tell me, what was he doing

771
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.671
wearing her panties on his head?

772
00:55:41.922 --> 00:55:43.381
Swung on and popped up.

773
00:55:43.465 --> 00:55:47.260
Uh-oh, Rexie,
I don't think this one's got the distance.


774
00:55:48.887 --> 00:55:51.389
Taylor under it.
He's got it, and this ball game is over...


775
00:55:51.473 --> 00:55:52.515
Shit.

776
00:55:52.599 --> 00:55:54.434
...as the Indians hold out
for a 3-2 victory.


777
00:55:54.518 --> 00:55:55.727
Yeah.

778
00:55:55.811 --> 00:55:58.021
Starting to come together, Pepper.
Starting to come together.


779
00:55:58.105 --> 00:55:59.105
Yeah.

780
00:56:03.485 --> 00:56:05.820
Knock it off, Charlie.

781
00:56:22.796 --> 00:56:24.547
Well, hi, Jake. Come on in.

782
00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:26.382
Hi, Suzanne.

783
00:56:26.467 --> 00:56:28.593
-How are you?
-Oh, I'm fine, thanks.


784
00:56:28.677 --> 00:56:31.846
I was just wondering if I might have
a quick word with Roger?


785
00:56:31.972 --> 00:56:34.265
Well, sure. He's in the solarium.
I'll get some coffee.


786
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:35.975
Oh, thank you.

787
00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:39.562
United Airlines down three-quarters
at 141.


788
00:56:39.646 --> 00:56:43.399
International Business Machines down
one-half to 96 and three-eighths.


789
00:56:43.484 --> 00:56:44.859
American Telephone & Telegraph...

790
00:56:44.943 --> 00:56:47.361
-Hey, Jake.
-Hey, Roger.


791
00:56:48.655 --> 00:56:49.614
Nice place.

792
00:56:49.698 --> 00:56:50.740
Yeah, we're still working on it,

793
00:56:50.824 --> 00:56:54.660
trying to figure if we wanna take
this room Oriental or Santa Fe.


794
00:56:54.745 --> 00:56:57.121
Listen, Rog, I had to talk to you
about something,


795
00:56:57.206 --> 00:56:59.290
and I didn't want to do it
in front of the rest of the team.


796
00:56:59.374 --> 00:57:01.292
Yeah, sure. What is it?
Here, have a seat. You want a beer?


797
00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:03.002
Oh, no, thank you.

798
00:57:04.505 --> 00:57:06.964
You have financial problems?

799
00:57:07.132 --> 00:57:09.050
I could put you on
to a great investment guy.


800
00:57:09.134 --> 00:57:12.637
No, I don't have much of a portfolio
right now,


801
00:57:12.721 --> 00:57:15.348
but, you know,
what I was concerned about


802
00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:16.808
was why you didn't come up
with that grounder


803
00:57:16.892 --> 00:57:18.559
that Reichart hit in the ninth.

804
00:57:18.644 --> 00:57:22.480
It was out of my reach.
What do you want me to do, dive for it?


805
00:57:25.025 --> 00:57:27.568
Rog, it could have meant the game.

806
00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:30.071
Oh, come on.
Cut the rah-rah shit, Taylor.


807
00:57:30.155 --> 00:57:31.364
Year after this, 
I go free agent.

808
00:57:31.448 --> 00:57:34.450
Plus, my agent and I got
a couple of plans for life after baseball.


809
00:57:34.535 --> 00:57:36.536
So, I am not
about to risk major injury,

810
00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:38.871
or deface this property,
for a collection of stiffs.


811
00:57:39.873 --> 00:57:40.998
You know, Dorn,

812
00:57:41.083 --> 00:57:44.127
I liked you so much better
when you were just a ballplayer.


813
00:57:44.211 --> 00:57:45.628
You were really great once.

814
00:57:45.712 --> 00:57:47.463
If you want to be
an interior decorator now,


815
00:57:47.548 --> 00:57:48.840
that's none of my business,

816
00:57:48.924 --> 00:57:51.217
but some of us still need this team.

817
00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:54.720
Now, you listen to me.
This is my last shot at a winner.


818
00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:57.056
And for the younger guys,
it could be their only shot.


819
00:57:57.141 --> 00:57:59.058
I don't know what happened to you,

820
00:57:59.143 --> 00:58:03.062
but if you ever, ever tank another play
like you did today,


821
00:58:03.897 --> 00:58:08.067
I'm gonna cut your nuts off
and stuff 'em down your fucking throat.


822
00:58:10.237 --> 00:58:11.821
Coffee, anybody?

823
00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:22.915
Hello again, all you Wahoo maniacs.
This is Harry Doyle welcoming you


824
00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.334
to another edition of Teepee Talk.

825
00:58:25.419 --> 00:58:27.003
Hey, in case you haven't noticed,

826
00:58:27.087 --> 00:58:29.547
and judging by the attendance,
you haven't,


827
00:58:29.631 --> 00:58:32.425
the Indians have managed
to win a few here and there,


828
00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:34.927
and are threatening
to climb out of the cellar.


829
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:47.648
Wild thing, you make my heart sing.

830
00:58:52.779 --> 00:58:55.281
You know, they could be a lot worse.

831
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:58.492
You know, these guys
ain't so fucking bad.


832
00:59:03.415 --> 00:59:07.460
Oh, boy, this old
body could use a soak.

833
00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:09.837
Yeah? Well, forget it,
'cause it ain't working again.


834
00:59:09.922 --> 00:59:13.299
Damn it! I thought they were gonna
replace this thing.


835
00:59:13.884 --> 00:59:16.385
Hey! No hot water in here.

836
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:19.388
I've had it with this
nickel-and-dime stuff.


837
00:59:19.598 --> 00:59:22.183
I'm gonna get that bitch on the phone.

838
00:59:22.935 --> 00:59:25.561
-You wanted to talk to the bitch?
-Yeah.


839
00:59:26.021 --> 00:59:29.649
Don't you think you ought to cover
yourself with a towel first, Mr. Brown?


840
00:59:29.733 --> 00:59:31.192
We're out of towels,

841
00:59:31.276 --> 00:59:34.070
and I'm too old
to go diving into lockers.

842
00:59:34.154 --> 00:59:36.155
I can take it if you can.

843
00:59:38.325 --> 00:59:41.953
What happened to the new whirlpool
we were supposed to get?


844
00:59:43.163 --> 00:59:46.666
Revenue problems have forced us
to cut back on equipment.


845
00:59:49.127 --> 00:59:50.503
Cups still work, though.

846
00:59:50.587 --> 00:59:52.630
We'll simply have to fix
the old whirlpool.


847
00:59:52.714 --> 00:59:54.966
You fixed it six times already.

848
00:59:55.092 --> 00:59:57.260
Now there's no hot water in the shower.

849
00:59:57.344 --> 01:00:00.346
The pipes in this building
are old and rusted.


850
01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:05.142
We're replacing them,
but it's a long, expensive process.


851
01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:06.269
Sorry.

852
01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.770
How am I supposed
to keep my players healthy


853
01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.272
with cold water
and no therapy equipment?


854
01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:12.608
Your players will just have to get
a little tougher.


855
01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:16.737
What are they, a bunch of pansies?

856
01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:20.992
Over 162 games,
even tough guys get sprains,


857
01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:22.285
sore arms, muscle pulls.

858
01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:24.412
It's only temporary.

859
01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:27.248
Besides, these guys weren't playing
that good


860
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.041
when the equipment was working.

861
01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:31.460
If I could get anybody
to come out and watch this team,


862
01:00:31.545 --> 01:00:34.130
none of this would be necessary.

863
01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:39.218
You ought to be grateful I can still afford
to pay your salary.


864
01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:59.238
Harris winds and delivers.

865
01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:01.907
Vaseline ball, swung on
and grounded to short.


866
01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:05.202
Hey, easy play for Malina.
Up with it, throws to first.


867
01:01:05.287 --> 01:01:06.746
And this ball game is over,

868
01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:09.874
as the Indians beat the Tigers
five to four.


869
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:14.420
Harris struggled, but picked up
his ninth win of the season.


870
01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:37.777
Frank, I need a car, quick,

871
01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.570
and mine's on the other side
of the stadium.


872
01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:41.697
-Take the bullpen car.
-Yeah.


873
01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.154
Whose place are we at this time?

874
01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:04.655
Mine.

875
01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:09.410
Did you follow me again?

876
01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:11.537
I spotted you in the stands.

877
01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:14.540
Figured you wanted
to see me about something.


878
01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.793
I just wanted to see you play.

879
01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.295
How was I?

880
01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:22.590
You ought to open your stance a little.
They're pitching you inside.


881
01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.218
I'll try that.

882
01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:27.928
What's all this?

883
01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:31.223
I'm moving in with Tom.

884
01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.519
-Going uptown, huh?
-No.


885
01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:37.813
Not going uptown.

886
01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:41.525
Just want to lead a regular life,
you know. Like an adult, maybe?


887
01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:44.069
You think I can't lead a regular life?

888
01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:46.697
Oh, God, Jake.

889
01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:47.990
Do you like the life you've had?

890
01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:51.368
You like hanging out with the boys,
living in hotels,


891
01:03:51.578 --> 01:03:54.788
having girls send you
their underwear in the mail.


892
01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:58.167
Remember the surprise party
I threw for you on your birthday?


893
01:03:58.251 --> 01:03:59.627
You never showed up,

894
01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:02.505
but the doorbell rang once,
and we all got real quiet


895
01:04:02.589 --> 01:04:04.673
and hid behind the furniture.

896
01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:07.051
It was a guy to serve you
with a paternity suit.


897
01:04:07.135 --> 01:04:10.679
That was a hoax.
The girl was looking for some publicity.


898
01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:13.432
Yeah, but you'd obviously been with her.

899
01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:16.018
And it happened
in front of all of our friends.


900
01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:18.145
Those days are gone, Lynn.

901
01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:22.775
I'm just a guy
trying to put his life back together.


902
01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:27.196
I've come back to you
so many times, Jake.


903
01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.740
I can't afford to believe you anymore.

904
01:04:29.824 --> 01:04:30.908
Well,

905
01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.453
I guess this is our last hurrah, then.

906
01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:37.122
Yeah. I guess so.

907
01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:47.925
Hey,

908
01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:51.637
did you ever read Moby Dick?

909
01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:54.974
Cover to cover, babe.

910
01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.060
When's the wedding?

911
01:04:58.144 --> 01:04:59.687
October 3rd.

912
01:04:59.771 --> 01:05:01.564
Your folks like this guy?

913
01:05:01.648 --> 01:05:04.567
You're still their favorite.

914
01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.695
-Gonna be a big wedding?
-No, Tom doesn't like big weddings.


915
01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:10.906
You know, you could have read
Plot Outlines of 101 Great Novels.


916
01:05:10.991 --> 01:05:12.616
-Where?
-At any library.


917
01:05:12.826 --> 01:05:16.495
-No, no, no. Where's the wedding?
-Oh, All Saints, on Euclid.


918
01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:28.340
-Nice church.
-Yeah.


919
01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:37.224
-Who saved Ishmael at the end?
-What?


920
01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:39.643
Nobody. It was Queequoc's...
Queequeg's coffin.


921
01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:41.020
Yeah.

922
01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.358
-Am I invited?
-Where?


923
01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.611
-To the wedding.
-Yeah.


924
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:50.362
-Lynn?
-What?


925
01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.448
The zipper on your skirt's stuck.

926
01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:54.533
Use your imagination.

927
01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.163
You know, this doesn't change anything.

928
01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.123
We were always good at this.

929
01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:20.976
We're 60 and 60.
Nine games out of first.


930
01:06:21.061 --> 01:06:22.853
Who do these guys think they are?

931
01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:25.481
Maybe you just have to accept the fact
they're not as bad as you hoped.


932
01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:27.900
I don't have to accept anything.

933
01:06:28.068 --> 01:06:30.110
Attendance is only just
beginning to rise.


934
01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:32.821
If we can force a losing streak,
we can still turn this thing around.


935
01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:35.616
What's left to do?
You've taken away everything you can.


936
01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:36.867
Not everything.

937
01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:46.919
Hey, Ricky, I'll trade you Song of
Hiawatha for The Deerslayer.


938
01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:49.254
Nah, I'm not into Song of Hiawatha.

939
01:06:49.381 --> 01:06:52.257
Veg-head, I think I got one here
that's right up your alley.


940
01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.176
Crime and Punishment.

941
01:06:57.389 --> 01:07:00.099
Hey, is that a detective story? Yeah?

942
01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:03.560
"Wild Thing" Vaughn

943
01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:06.605
roughed up in his only other
appearance against the Yankees,


944
01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:07.856
in a little jam here.

945
01:07:07.941 --> 01:07:09.483
He fanned Burton to open the inning,

946
01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:12.361
walked Saslow,
gave up a double to Billy Leff,


947
01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:13.862
which will bring up Haywood,

948
01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:16.281
who leads the league
in most offensive categories,


949
01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.117
including nose hair.

950
01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:21.495
When this guy sneezes,
he looks like a party favor.


951
01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:23.664
Taylor, they ain't released you yet?

952
01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:26.333
Haywood's a convicted felon,
isn't he, Monte?


953
01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.961
-Doesn't really say it here.
-Well, he should be.


954
01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:31.547
Vaughn among the league leaders
in strikeouts now,


955
01:07:31.631 --> 01:07:33.465
up on the rubber and ready to work.

956
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.093
And from the wind-up, here he comes.

957
01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:40.013
Haywood swings and crushes one
towards South America.


958
01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.725
Tomlinson's gonna need a visa
to catch this one.


959
01:07:42.809 --> 01:07:46.937
It is out of here,
and there's nothing left but a vapor trail.


960
01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:50.816
Vaughn continues to have problems
with Haywood and the Yankees.


961
01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.276
Oh, boy.

962
01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:01.702
Hi, Lou.

963
01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:03.328
Donovan, what are you doing here?

964
01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:06.373
Well, I just wanted to get back out
on the road again.


965
01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:09.918
You know, you had a hell of a road trip.
You nearly pulled that one out today.


966
01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:13.172
Someday we'll figure out
how to beat those guys.


967
01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.341
You know, you've done
a great job this year.


968
01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:19.219
60 and 61 is hardly a great job.

969
01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:21.597
With this club, it is.

970
01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.434
You know, there's a lot of talent
on this club, Charlie.


971
01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:27.352
The veterans are starting to play
back to form,


972
01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:29.354
and the rookies are developing faster
than I thought.


973
01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.649
There's two or three
potential all-stars in there.


974
01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:36.153
I think we're a contender, right now.

975
01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:37.988
You really believe that, don't you?

976
01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.281
I know it.

977
01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:42.659
All we need is something
to bring it all together.


978
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:46.663
Rachel Phelps will never
allow that to happen.


979
01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:55.672
Can I have your attention, please?

980
01:08:57.175 --> 01:09:00.552
I have something I think
you all ought to know about.


981
01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:06.266
It seems that Mrs. Phelps
doesn't think too highly of our worth.


982
01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:09.812
She put this team together

983
01:09:09.896 --> 01:09:13.482
because she thought
we'd be bad enough to finish dead last,


984
01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:15.150
knocking attendance down to the point

985
01:09:15.235 --> 01:09:18.111
where she could move the team
to Miami


986
01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:21.365
and get rid of all of us
for better personnel.


987
01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:24.076
Even me?

988
01:09:24.244 --> 01:09:25.494
Even you, Dorn.

989
01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:27.454
What if we don't finish last?

990
01:09:27.539 --> 01:09:30.332
She'll replace you
with somebody who will.


991
01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:34.127
After this season,
you'll be sent back to the minors


992
01:09:34.212 --> 01:09:36.797
or given your outright release.

993
01:09:48.268 --> 01:09:51.603
Well, then I guess
there's only one thing left to do.


994
01:09:52.146 --> 01:09:53.564
What's that?

995
01:09:54.566 --> 01:09:56.775
Win the whole fucking thing.

996
01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:09.454
-Yeah.
-Yes!


997
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.625
Yes!

998
01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:17.546
Yeah.

999
01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:19.756
Yeah.

1000
01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:30.017
I figure it's gonna take

1001
01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:34.605
Every time we win, we peel a section.

1002
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:36.648
Yeah.

1003
01:10:43.031 --> 01:10:44.865
Come on.

1004
01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:51.163
Oh, shit.

1005
01:11:02.592 --> 01:11:03.759
Strike!

1006
01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.093
He's out!

1007
01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.227
Safe!

1008
01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:17.022
-Yeah, man.
-Yes!


1009
01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:33.580
Strike!

1010
01:11:34.874 --> 01:11:35.874
Strike!

1011
01:11:41.339 --> 01:11:42.464
Shit!

1012
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.637
He's out!

1013
01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:56.269
Hello. Do you know us?
We're a major league baseball team.


1014
01:11:56.896 --> 01:11:59.856
But since we haven't won
a pennant in over 30 years,


1015
01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:01.733
nobody recognizes us,

1016
01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.944
not even in our own hometown.

1017
01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:07.030
That's why we carry
the American Express card.


1018
01:12:07.115 --> 01:12:10.242
No matter how far out of first we are,
it's cool.


1019
01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:11.994
You know, it keeps us
from getting shut out


1020
01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:15.247
at our favorite hotels
and restaurant-type places.


1021
01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.624
So, if you're looking
for some big-league clout,


1022
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:20.085
apply for that little green
home-run hitter.


1023
01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.920
Look what it's done for us.

1024
01:12:22.005 --> 01:12:24.589
People still don't recognize us, but...

1025
01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:28.301
We're contenders now.

1026
01:12:28.428 --> 01:12:31.847
The American Express card.
Don't steal home without it.


1027
01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:37.162
Yeah!

1028
01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:52.552
Safe!

1029
01:13:56.474 --> 01:13:58.183
Cowabunga!

1030
01:13:58.267 --> 01:14:00.143
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

1031
01:14:00.228 --> 01:14:01.478
The incredible has happened.

1032
01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:03.730
Even though it comes as no surprise
to this commentator,


1033
01:14:03.815 --> 01:14:07.109
the Indians have finished
the regular season in a first-place tie


1034
01:14:07.193 --> 01:14:08.193
with the New York Yankees

1035
01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.737
on the strength of a 4-2 win
over the White Sox


1036
01:14:10.822 --> 01:14:12.864
in Chicago today.

1037
01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:20.831
All right!

1038
01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:23.959
Not bad for a has-been
and a couple of never-will-be's, huh?


1039
01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:25.293
Yeah. Yeah.

1040
01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:28.547
We haven't won anything yet.
Still got one game to go.


1041
01:14:29.382 --> 01:14:32.467
The Indians are still savoring
their victory today in Chicago


1042
01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:34.469
but are due to
leave in a few hours.

1043
01:14:34.554 --> 01:14:36.221
We're going to go back now
to Ross Farmer,


1044
01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.431
who's standing by with the team
at their hotel.


1045
01:14:38.516 --> 01:14:40.058
Thank you, Hal. 
Well, as you can see,

1046
01:14:40.143 --> 01:14:42.269
the Indians are in high spirits tonight,

1047
01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:45.188
looking forward to their final showdown

1048
01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:47.023
with the Yankees.

1049
01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:50.610
Who will start that game
is still a matter of some conjecture,


1050
01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:54.156
but the smart money is on
the crafty veteran, Eddie Harris,


1051
01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.076
or the young fireballer,
"Wild Thing" Ricky Vaughn.


1052
01:14:58.244 --> 01:14:59.619
Meanwhile, the Yanks have announced

1053
01:14:59.704 --> 01:15:02.664
that they will start 20-game winner
Steve Jackson,


1054
01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:05.458
a curve-ball specialist who has shut...

1055
01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:16.052
You wanted to see me, skip?

1056
01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.222
Yeah, Rick. Have a seat.

1057
01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:26.563
I just wanted to tell you
that I'm starting Harris


1058
01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:28.857
against the Yankees tomorrow,

1059
01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:32.110
even though I know
it's your turn in the rotation.


1060
01:15:32.737 --> 01:15:34.696
He's got a little more experience,

1061
01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.741
with a bit better record
against the Yankees.


1062
01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:41.786
Yeah, I guess what's best for the team.

1063
01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.080
Don't read anything into it, Rick.

1064
01:15:44.165 --> 01:15:46.875
You're one of the
guys that got us here.

1065
01:15:51.130 --> 01:15:52.214
Hello again, everybody.

1066
01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:54.883
Harry Doyle coming to you
live from the stadium,


1067
01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:57.010
where the Indians
have just returned home


1068
01:15:57.094 --> 01:15:59.554
in preparation
for their one-game play-off


1069
01:15:59.639 --> 01:16:02.891
with the New York Yankees
for the Eastern Division Championship.


1070
01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:06.102
We'll have interviews
on Indians Powwow at 8:00,


1071
01:16:06.187 --> 01:16:10.023
but in the meantime,
get your tomahawks ready, Cleveland.


1072
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.984
You're the best!

1073
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.405
You mind if I join you?

1074
01:16:59.198 --> 01:17:02.242
I don't think I'd be very good company
right now.


1075
01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:05.036
-Why not?
-Nothing.


1076
01:17:05.871 --> 01:17:07.247
Job problem.

1077
01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.793
-I'm a ballplayer.
-I know.


1078
01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:14.879
But that's not why I came over here.

1079
01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:17.132
I don't chase ballplayers.

1080
01:17:17.216 --> 01:17:19.384
Why'd you come over here then?

1081
01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:26.099
Because you are the sexiest man
I have ever laid eyes on,


1082
01:17:29.312 --> 01:17:32.355
and you look like
you could use a friend.

1083
01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:37.736
Check.

1084
01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.492
Where are you going?

1085
01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:46.369
I've got to get home.

1086
01:17:47.747 --> 01:17:50.081
I don't think I ever got your name.

1087
01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:53.084
Suzanne. Suzanne Dorn.

1088
01:17:55.755 --> 01:17:57.213
Suzanne Dorn?

1089
01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.385
Mrs. Roger Dorn.

1090
01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:08.600
So long. You're a great kid.

1091
01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:19.444
Hi, Jake.

1092
01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:32.582
I didn't know who she was.
I swear to God.


1093
01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:36.920
Got one off the chest,
but he's up with it, and it's over!


1094
01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:40.048
Bye-bye, honey. See you at the park.
Wish me luck.


1095
01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:45.553
Before you go,

1096
01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:48.264
there's something I'd like to tell you.

1097
01:18:48.349 --> 01:18:49.432
What?

1098
01:18:49.517 --> 01:18:51.893
I don't know what Dorn's wife
is up to, but I think it best


1099
01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:54.145
if you get dressed out early
and out to the bullpen


1100
01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.981
before Dorn hits the clubhouse, okay?

1101
01:18:57.942 --> 01:18:59.734
Hey, we got a big problem.

1102
01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:01.820
Cerrano wants some
extra power for tonight.


1103
01:19:01.904 --> 01:19:04.948
He's looking to sacrifice a live chicken.

1104
01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:06.157
Hey, Jake, man, we can't have people

1105
01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.076
puking in the locker room
before the game.


1106
01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:10.120
God, what next?

1107
01:19:10.204 --> 01:19:13.331
All right, tell him not to worry.
I'll think of something. Come on.


1108
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.251
Jake.

1109
01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.628
Where's Vaughn? 
Seen him around?

1110
01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:22.882
If you do, tell him I'd like
to have a little talk with him.


1111
01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:30.598
-Thanks, Pepper.
-Yeah.


1112
01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:33.143
One whole chicken, just like you said.

1113
01:19:58.252 --> 01:19:59.335
Hello again, everybody.

1114
01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:02.130
Harry Doyle bidding you
a big Wahoo welcome


1115
01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:03.798
from Municipal Stadium,

1116
01:20:03.883 --> 01:20:09.012
where tonight, before a capacity crowd
of 75,000 screaming feather-heads,


1117
01:20:09.096 --> 01:20:11.556
the fighting braves of the Cuyahoga

1118
01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.142
will leave their teepees
in search of Cleveland's


1119
01:20:14.226 --> 01:20:17.479
first league championship
in over 30 years.


1120
01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:20.106
Standing in the way,
their long-time nemesis,


1121
01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:21.608
the New York Yankees.

1122
01:20:21.692 --> 01:20:24.360
Trying to put the stop on the Yanks
will be Eddie Harris,


1123
01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:26.696
the tribe's veteran right-hander.

1124
01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:29.949
-Monte, anything to add?
-No.


1125
01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:32.952
He's not the best colorman
in the league for nothing, folks.


1126
01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:35.079
All right, we're set to go.

1127
01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:40.502
-Are you ready?
-We're ready!


1128
01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:42.629
Are you ready? 
Let's take it to 'em!

1129
01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:19.415
Two out in the first inning,
and Harris looking very sharp, so far.


1130
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:22.961
The sign from Taylor.
The target goes up, and the pitch.


1131
01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:26.798
Here's a bouncer to third,
easy play for Dorn.


1132
01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:30.802
Fires across to Metcalfe,
and the Yankees are gone in the first.


1133
01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:36.516
Bottom of the third,

1134
01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.394
Cerrano swings and misses,
strike three.


1135
01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:42.564
Springer leads away from first.

1136
01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:45.942
Harris comes to the plate,
Taylor, snap throw to first, got him!


1137
01:21:46.443 --> 01:21:48.403
Springer is picked off.

1138
01:21:49.113 --> 01:21:51.447
Jackson deals. 
Hayes pops it up,

1139
01:21:51.532 --> 01:21:54.492
and that will do it
for the Indians in the fourth.


1140
01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:58.079
Harris delivers.
K-Y ball hit toward the hole.


1141
01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:01.916
Hey, great stop by Dorn!
Throws in time, and he got him.


1142
01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:04.919
A curve ball,
and down goes Cerrano again.


1143
01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:06.337
Strike!

1144
01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:09.090
Williams swings and drives one deep.

1145
01:22:10.634 --> 01:22:13.261
Back goes Hayes. 
Way back to the wall.

1146
01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:15.763
Jumps, and makes a great catch!

1147
01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:19.142
What a play, and the Yankees
are turned away in the sixth!


1148
01:22:28.402 --> 01:22:31.404
Still nothing-nothing.
Top of the seventh, with two out.


1149
01:22:31.488 --> 01:22:33.823
Harris has been in trouble,
but has battled his way out


1150
01:22:33.907 --> 01:22:36.075
with the help of some
great defensive plays.


1151
01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:38.578
All right, here's Burton coming on.

1152
01:22:41.332 --> 01:22:45.168
Harris, from the stretch, is ready,
and here he comes to Burton.


1153
01:22:45.252 --> 01:22:47.420
He swings and drives one to right field.

1154
01:22:47.504 --> 01:22:52.342
Uh-oh, this one is way back, way back.
It is off the reservation.


1155
01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:56.387
A home run, and the Yankees now lead
two to nothing.


1156
01:22:57.931 --> 01:22:59.932
That ought to shut these people up.

1157
01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.852
Well, the Indians have been
living dangerously all night,


1158
01:23:02.936 --> 01:23:05.563
and Burton finally burned them.

1159
01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.482
One down, bottom of the seventh.

1160
01:23:07.566 --> 01:23:10.276
Taylor hits a ground ball to short.
Danello up with it.


1161
01:23:10.361 --> 01:23:13.571
On to first in time,
and Taylor is hobbling a little


1162
01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:15.907
as he goes back to the dugout.

1163
01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:24.457
-Now batting, number 24.
-Go, Roger.


1164
01:23:25.292 --> 01:23:28.503
Third baseman, Roger Dorn.

1165
01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:31.506
Dorn up.
Two men out, bottom of the seventh.


1166
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:34.092
The Indians running out of chances.

1167
01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:36.302
Dorn, off to a slow start this year,

1168
01:23:36.387 --> 01:23:40.556
has come on lately,
hitting .271, with 86 RBIs.


1169
01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:42.975
Here's the wind-up,
and the pitch to him.


1170
01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:46.521
And he swings and drives
a base hit to left field.


1171
01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:53.027
And the Indians have a runner here
with two men out


1172
01:23:53.112 --> 01:23:55.780
on a sharp single to left by Dorn.

1173
01:23:56.281 --> 01:24:00.576
All right. That'll bring up Cerrano,
the big man, with two away,


1174
01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:03.204
and he represents the tying run.

1175
01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:07.709
Now batting, number 13,
Pedro Cerrano.


1176
01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:09.252
Cerrano hitless tonight.

1177
01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:11.796
As a matter of fact,
he hasn't touched the ball yet.


1178
01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:16.467
-Pedro! Pedro! Pedro!
-Pedro! Pedro! Pedro!


1179
01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:21.723
Cerrano ready now.

1180
01:24:21.807 --> 01:24:23.975
Here's the pitch. 
Swings and misses.

1181
01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:26.811
We should have gotten a live chicken.

1182
01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:30.398
Cerrano digging in. 
Down a strike.

1183
01:24:32.359 --> 01:24:34.902
Jackson gets his sign, and comes set.

1184
01:24:35.112 --> 01:24:37.780
Checks Dorn at first. 
Here's the pitch.

1185
01:24:37.865 --> 01:24:39.991
A curve ball. Swung on and missed.

1186
01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:43.619
Strike two, and Cerrano
wasn't even close to that one.


1187
01:24:44.997 --> 01:24:47.206
Pissed off now, Jobu.

1188
01:24:47.291 --> 01:24:50.001
Look, I good to you. 
I stick up for you.

1189
01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.837
If you no help me now,

1190
01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:57.383
I say, fuck you, Jobu. 
I do it myself.

1191
01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:13.399
Jackson wants a new sign.
Now he's got what he likes.


1192
01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:18.070
Here's the pitch to Cerrano.

1193
01:25:18.489 --> 01:25:21.240
He swings, and drives one to deep left.

1194
01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:25.536
Way back! Way back! 
This ball is gone!

1195
01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:26.788
Yeah!

1196
01:25:50.938 --> 01:25:53.105
Jobu! Yes!

1197
01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:03.616
Sit down, Charlie.

1198
01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:23.553
Welcome to the happy hunting ground!

1199
01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:25.805
The Indians have tied it at two

1200
01:26:25.889 --> 01:26:28.474
on a two-run blast by Cerrano.

1201
01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:35.231
Two outs, top of the ninth,
still tied at two.


1202
01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:37.483
Harris working on a seven-hitter.

1203
01:26:37.568 --> 01:26:40.194
Here's the pitch.
Saslow hits a long drive.


1204
01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:43.072
This one's gonna get
over Cerrano's head and off the wall.


1205
01:26:43.156 --> 01:26:46.868
Cerrano up with it.
Fires it back in, Marx digging for third.


1206
01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:49.370
Saslow into second
with a standing double,


1207
01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.873
and the Yankees have runners
at second and third,


1208
01:26:51.957 --> 01:26:55.126
as Harris is now beginning to show
signs of fatigue.


1209
01:26:55.419 --> 01:26:56.419
Shit!

1210
01:26:57.254 --> 01:26:58.838
Get Vaughn up.

1211
01:27:03.468 --> 01:27:05.845
Activity continues in the bullpen.

1212
01:27:06.096 --> 01:27:08.306
Harris is in real trouble now.

1213
01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:11.893
He got the first two hitters,
then gave up a single and a double,


1214
01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:14.312
and has now gone
3 and 0 to Cheevers.

1215
01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:18.232
Harris sets, checks the runners.

1216
01:27:18.317 --> 01:27:21.110
Comes to the plate. 
High, ball four,

1217
01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:23.946
and the bases are loaded,
and that's gonna bring up


1218
01:27:24.031 --> 01:27:27.408
Clue Haywood, the biggest
Indian-killer of them all.


1219
01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:29.577
Taylor and Brown
on their way to the mound,


1220
01:27:29.661 --> 01:27:33.456
and this could be all for Harris.
He has pitched a beauty.


1221
01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:38.252
How's it holding, Eddie?
You look a little tired.


1222
01:27:38.337 --> 01:27:41.756
I'm throwing every piece of junk
I can think of at 'em, skipper.


1223
01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.382
I got enough left for one more hitter.

1224
01:27:43.467 --> 01:27:45.217
Nah.
You pitched a hell of a game there.


1225
01:27:45.302 --> 01:27:48.346
Take a seat, and we'll see
if we can get this guy out for you.


1226
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:50.681
-All right.
-Good game, Eddie.


1227
01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:52.683
Give me Vaughn.

1228
01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:54.727
You want Vaughn?

1229
01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:56.520
I know he hasn't done
very well against this guy,


1230
01:27:56.605 --> 01:27:58.731
but I got a hunch he's due.

1231
01:27:59.566 --> 01:28:01.484
Good job. Good job.

1232
01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.923
Wild thing

1233
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.426
You make my heart sing

1234
01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:29.762
I hate this fucking song.

1235
01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:36.644
Come on, wild thing

1236
01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:50.741
Wild thing, I think I love you

1237
01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:54.912
But I wanna know for sure

1238
01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:05.840
Okay, Ricky.

1239
01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:08.384
Haywood likes the hard stuff
out over the plate,


1240
01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:11.595
so bust him in,
and don't get up with anything.


1241
01:29:12.472 --> 01:29:14.348
-You listening to me, Rick?
-Yeah.


1242
01:29:14.433 --> 01:29:17.143
Okay, you're my man. 
Go get him, kid.

1243
01:29:19.730 --> 01:29:23.482
This guy's the out
you've been waiting your whole life for.


1244
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:27.111
Wild thing

1245
01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:30.489
Come on, wild thing

1246
01:29:31.533 --> 01:29:35.161
Come on, come on, come on, wild thing

1247
01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:37.788
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

1248
01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:38.956
Wild thing

1249
01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:43.961
Come on, come on, wild thing

1250
01:29:44.046 --> 01:29:47.840
So, a surprise move by Brown here,
bringing in the Wild Thing,


1251
01:29:47.924 --> 01:29:51.635
who's been shelled
in two outings against the Yankees.


1252
01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:58.684
Oh, shit.

1253
01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:12.156
Let's cut through the crap, Vaughn.
I only got one thing to say to you.


1254
01:30:14.534 --> 01:30:16.744
Strike this motherfucker out!

1255
01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:31.842
Okay, the conference
on the mound is over,


1256
01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:33.844
and we are ready to go.

1257
01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:39.183
Now batting, number six,
first baseman, Clue Haywood.


1258
01:30:44.147 --> 01:30:45.272
Haywood steps in,

1259
01:30:45.357 --> 01:30:47.149
the American League's
Triple Crown winner.


1260
01:30:47.234 --> 01:30:51.195
.341 average, 48 homers, 121 RBIs.

1261
01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:54.490
He's homered the only two times
he's faced Vaughn.


1262
01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:07.211
All right, Ricky. 
Let's get nasty.

1263
01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:11.507
Haywood's set at the plate.

1264
01:31:12.175 --> 01:31:14.385
Vaughn, from the wind-up...

1265
01:31:14.594 --> 01:31:16.137
Swing and a miss.

1266
01:31:19.224 --> 01:31:20.766
That sucker was moving, wasn't it?

1267
01:31:20.851 --> 01:31:24.228
If it hit you, it'd leave
a two-foot hole coming out.


1268
01:31:26.398 --> 01:31:28.440
Okay, what shall we call now?

1269
01:31:28.525 --> 01:31:31.735
Let's see what the kid feels
about the old number one.


1270
01:31:35.198 --> 01:31:38.325
Wild Thing delivers. Strike two!

1271
01:31:38.410 --> 01:31:39.952
Fuck!

1272
01:31:45.375 --> 01:31:49.003
Forget about the curve ball, Ricky.
Give him the heater.


1273
01:31:49.504 --> 01:31:52.381
Now, shit.
All these pitches to choose from.


1274
01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:55.885
Maybe we ought to try
something different this time.


1275
01:32:25.332 --> 01:32:28.209
-Got him swinging!
-Strike three!


1276
01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:30.920
All right, Ricky! Yeah!

1277
01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:47.061
Oh, Lordy! Three straight heaters,
and the Yankees are blown down.


1278
01:32:47.145 --> 01:32:50.314
No runs, two hits, three left on.

1279
01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:52.483
And are you ready, Cleveland?

1280
01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:55.819
We go to the Indian ninth
still tied at two.


1281
01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:59.657
Can you believe this, Monte?

1282
01:33:02.285 --> 01:33:05.746
One down in the ninth.
Jackson delivers, Tomlinson swings


1283
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.790
and drives one deep to right field!

1284
01:33:07.874 --> 01:33:11.418
Back goes Worberg
and makes the catch against the wall.


1285
01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:14.255
Tomlinson gave it a ride,
but came up short.


1286
01:33:14.839 --> 01:33:17.758
That's gonna bring a visit to the mound.

1287
01:33:17.842 --> 01:33:21.345
And Horton wasting no time.
He's going to the Duke.


1288
01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:28.560
The Duke leads the league
in saves, strikeouts per inning


1289
01:33:28.645 --> 01:33:30.020
and hit batsmen.

1290
01:33:30.105 --> 01:33:33.274
This guy threw at his own kid
in a father-son game.


1291
01:33:33.358 --> 01:33:39.029
Now batting, number double zero,
center fielder Willie Mays Hayes.


1292
01:33:39.114 --> 01:33:42.574
Two down now, as Hayes steps in,
hitting .291.


1293
01:33:42.701 --> 01:33:45.619
Trying to get something going
for the tribe.


1294
01:33:46.538 --> 01:33:49.331
The Duke, who's been overpowering
down the stretch,


1295
01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:53.085
has not been scored upon
in his last 16 appearances.


1296
01:33:54.754 --> 01:33:59.008
The Duke ready now and delivers.
Here's a high chopper towards short.


1297
01:33:59.384 --> 01:34:01.802
Danello charges. Can he get him? No!

1298
01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:03.637
-Safe!
-Hayes beat it!


1299
01:34:11.521 --> 01:34:12.563
All right!

1300
01:34:26.995 --> 01:34:30.622
-Going somewhere, meat?
-About 90 feet.


1301
01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:35.711
Number seven, catcher Jake Taylor.

1302
01:34:42.177 --> 01:34:43.844
Taylor to the plate.

1303
01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:46.847
He's 0 for 12 against the Duke, lifetime.

1304
01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:49.641
The Duke has his sign and is ready.

1305
01:34:49.768 --> 01:34:51.352
Hayes with a good lead.

1306
01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:53.604
-Go! Go! Go! Go!
-Go! Go! Go! Go!


1307
01:35:00.236 --> 01:35:02.863
A quick move by the Duke,
and Hayes just beat it back.


1308
01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:04.531
Safe!

1309
01:35:16.294 --> 01:35:18.545
Hayes leads away again.

1310
01:35:18.630 --> 01:35:21.382
Tie game, 2-2, two outs in the ninth,

1311
01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:22.841
and the winning run at first.

1312
01:35:22.926 --> 01:35:25.386
Hayes out to a big lead now.

1313
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:36.563
Hayes goes!

1314
01:35:41.778 --> 01:35:43.862
Come on!

1315
01:35:45.365 --> 01:35:47.032
Come on, Willie.

1316
01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:49.827
Here's the throw.

1317
01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:51.912
-Safe!
-Yeah!


1318
01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:53.122
Yeah!

1319
01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.296
All right, Willie! Way to go!

1320
01:36:03.716 --> 01:36:07.052
-Whoo! All right!
-You, man! You, man!


1321
01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:11.432
It's up to Taylor now,

1322
01:36:11.516 --> 01:36:15.436
as the Indians have the winning run
in scoring position.


1323
01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:25.362
That's a hell of an idea.

1324
01:36:45.884 --> 01:36:48.469
What's this?
Taylor is pointing to the bleachers.


1325
01:36:48.553 --> 01:36:50.387
He's calling his shot.

1326
01:36:52.932 --> 01:36:56.518
Nobody's done this since Babe Ruth
in the '32 World Series.


1327
01:36:56.644 --> 01:36:59.605
Hayes leads from second,
as Duke takes his stretch.


1328
01:36:59.689 --> 01:37:00.981
The pitch.

1329
01:37:01.065 --> 01:37:03.984
Look out! Down goes Taylor!

1330
01:37:09.616 --> 01:37:12.910
Come on, hairball!
Cut down on that shit, man!


1331
01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:15.204
Bring that shit to me, man.

1332
01:37:15.288 --> 01:37:18.499
Taylor back up,
refusing to dust himself off


1333
01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:21.585
after Duke gave him a little chin music.

1334
01:37:26.049 --> 01:37:28.008
Taylor's pointing again!

1335
01:37:34.015 --> 01:37:38.227
Unbelievable. They're on their feet here,
stomping, clapping.


1336
01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:41.438
Come on.
Join in wherever you are out there.


1337
01:37:41.523 --> 01:37:42.940
Let's hear you, Cleveland!

1338
01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:45.317
-Go, go, go!
-Go, go, go!


1339
01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:58.664
Taylor waits at the plate.

1340
01:37:59.457 --> 01:38:02.417
The Duke at the belt.
Hayes away from second.


1341
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:11.510
Here comes the 1-1 pitch.

1342
01:38:17.225 --> 01:38:18.600
Taylor bunts.

1343
01:38:18.685 --> 01:38:19.685
Shit.

1344
01:38:45.545 --> 01:38:46.670
Safe!

1345
01:38:47.839 --> 01:38:51.216
Hayes around third!
He's gonna try to score!


1346
01:38:53.011 --> 01:38:55.095
Here comes the throw.

1347
01:38:58.349 --> 01:39:01.476
He slides! He is...

1348
01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:03.228
Safe! Safe!

1349
01:39:03.855 --> 01:39:06.064
And the Indians win it!
The Indians win it!


1350
01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:08.692
Oh, my God! The Indians win it!

1351
01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:25.083
I can't believe it!

1352
01:39:51.319 --> 01:39:54.319
We did it! We did it!
