Hi, beautiful.

Mwah.

34
00:02:19.548 --> 00:02:21.590
Hi, you. You look great.

35
00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:22.673
Oh, thanks, thanks.

36
00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:25.048
- Paul!
- Paul! Right over here.


37
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:26.881
- Two seconds.
- Okay.


38
00:02:26.965 --> 00:02:31.256
Hi, how you doing? Good to see you again.
How are you? Thank you so much for coming.


39
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.131
- A few questions.
- Hang on a second. Hang on.


40
00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:38.673
I'd be nowhere without this amazing woman
and brilliant writer in her own right,


41
00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:40.548
my book editor, 
Madeline Kelly.

42
00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:42.506
- Maddie, come here. Come here.
- Oh.


43
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.798
This is our night, Maddie.
You and me, we did this together.


44
00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:51.256
You wrote a great story, Paul.
I just helped you polish it up.


45
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.673
Save me a moment inside, will you?
I have something I want to talk about.


46
00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:56.131
- What is it?
- You'll see.


47
00:02:56.798 --> 00:02:57.798
- Okay.
- Okay.


48
00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:00.215
- Quick question.
- Hi, Jay.


49
00:03:00.298 --> 00:03:04.173
So, was there a particular lady
in your life that inspired the love story?


50
00:03:04.256 --> 00:03:07.256
Well, come on, you know,
I can't give away all of my secrets.


51
00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:12.840
- Always good to be back.
- Yeah? Another bestseller?


52
00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:13.756
Hello?

53
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.965
- Oh, Maddie.
<i>- Hi, Mom.</i>


54
00:03:16.048 --> 00:03:17.340
Glad I caught you.

55
00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:18.965
<i>What's that clicking noise?</i>

56
00:03:19.048 --> 00:03:21.673
I'm trying to order toilet paper online.

57
00:03:21.756 --> 00:03:23.631
The students keep stealing it,

58
00:03:23.715 --> 00:03:25.756
and the button on my keyboard

59
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.881
<i>keeps getting stuck.</i>

60
00:03:26.965 --> 00:03:28.131
Too much detail, Mom.

61
00:03:28.215 --> 00:03:29.423
Well, you asked.

62
00:03:29.506 --> 00:03:30.840
It's a little hectic here.

63
00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:32.631
I got stuck in traffic, and I just

64
00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:34.256
<i>literally got to the venue.</i>

65
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.048
You're gonna be late for your big night.
It's bad time management.


66
00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:39.965
<i>I wish I could've
been there to help you.</i>

67
00:03:40.048 --> 00:03:42.673
- Okay, Mom, can you hang on a second?
<i>- Of course.</i>


68
00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.090
Yeah, just one second.

69
00:03:44.173 --> 00:03:45.631
Okay, go ahead.

70
00:03:45.715 --> 00:03:46.590
<i>I was calling</i>

71
00:03:46.673 --> 00:03:49.256
to see if you've
had that talk with Paul.

72
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.548
Not yet. I hope you haven't told anyone
about my feelings for him.


73
00:03:53.631 --> 00:03:55.173
Trust me.

74
00:03:55.256 --> 00:03:56.631
No one in Des Moines cares.

75
00:03:56.715 --> 00:03:58.798
Well, Heather and Emma don't even know.

76
00:03:58.881 --> 00:04:00.173
<i>You didn't tell them?</i>

77
00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:01.965
<i>I'm just... 
I'm not ready.</i>

78
00:04:02.048 --> 00:04:03.590
If your friends don't know,

79
00:04:03.673 --> 00:04:06.048
it's entirely possible
that Paul doesn't either.


80
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:08.048
No, I've given him plenty of signs.

81
00:04:08.131 --> 00:04:10.756
<i>You should see the way he looks at me
when we work together.</i>


82
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.590
<i>- Mom, he gets me.</i>
- Well, you're in love with him.


83
00:04:13.673 --> 00:04:16.131
<i>- Why don't you just tell him?</i>
- I may not have to.


84
00:04:16.215 --> 00:04:17.715
<i>Oh. What's happened?</i>

85
00:04:18.423 --> 00:04:20.923
<i>He says he has to talk to me
about something.</i>


86
00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:23.131
<i>- Really?</i>
- So tonight may be the night.


87
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.715
Ah! It works.

88
00:04:25.798 --> 00:04:27.048
Okay, Mom, I have to go.

89
00:04:27.131 --> 00:04:30.006
<i>All right. If he doesn't tell you
how he feels about you tonight,</i>


90
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.048
you gotta speak up. 
That's all I'll say.

91
00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:34.756
- Okay, love you. Bye.
<i>- Love you too.</i>


92
00:04:37.256 --> 00:04:39.340
- Hey, girls!
- Hi!


93
00:04:39.423 --> 00:04:41.173
This is so exciting.

94
00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:43.298
We are so proud of you.

95
00:04:43.381 --> 00:04:46.881
- Thank you for coming.
- Oh, where's the scarf I gave you to wear?


96
00:04:46.965 --> 00:04:49.548
- Somewhere in Brooklyn by now.
- How'd that happen?


97
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:52.923
Freak accident. I totally get if you
never wanna loan me anything again.


98
00:04:53.006 --> 00:04:56.465
Don't worry about it, Mads.
That scarf was a sample from work.


99
00:04:57.173 --> 00:04:59.673
Heather, great job on the cover art.

100
00:04:59.756 --> 00:05:00.756
You like it?

101
00:05:00.798 --> 00:05:03.215
It's stunning. 
What do you think, Emma?

102
00:05:03.298 --> 00:05:06.006
- I think you've been holding out on us.
- On what? Paul?


103
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.673
Yeah, you've been working
with him for over a year.


104
00:05:08.756 --> 00:05:10.506
Don't tell me you haven't noticed.

105
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.090
I think he's an amazing writer.
That's all.


106
00:05:13.173 --> 00:05:15.423
You should have
your name on the cover with him.


107
00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:18.256
- You practically wrote the book.
- No, I didn't.


108
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.048
I mean, not exactly.

109
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:21.798
Besides, it's good for my career.

110
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:23.923
Paul's talking me up to the publisher.

111
00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:26.256
- He's Irish.
- Yes.


112
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.298
- Does he have a sexy accent?
- Haven't noticed.


113
00:05:28.381 --> 00:05:30.048
- Is he single?
- Give me that.


114
00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:32.673
- Okay.
- Where are you going?


115
00:05:32.756 --> 00:05:33.881
To find Paul.

116
00:05:39.465 --> 00:05:42.256

Come on, Maddie. 
Don't wimp out now.

120
00:05:52.506 --> 00:05:53.798
Here you are.

121
00:05:54.756 --> 00:05:58.423
Thought I'd use a little liquid courage
before going in to face the masses.


122
00:05:58.506 --> 00:06:00.715
They're gonna love it.
It's a beautiful story.


123
00:06:01.506 --> 00:06:03.256
Well, I have you to thank for that.

124
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.840
If I had my way,

125
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:07.601
the lovers would have tossed themselves
into the lake by chapter ten.


126
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:10.256
You're amazing. 
You know that?

127
00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:12.631
You balance me out, Madeline.

128
00:06:13.215 --> 00:06:14.590
We do make a great team.

129
00:06:14.673 --> 00:06:17.006
We do, which is why
I wanted to talk to you


130
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.715
about something really important to me.

131
00:06:19.798 --> 00:06:22.465
- You know you can tell me anything.
- Well...


132
00:06:24.006 --> 00:06:26.006
I feel like it's time

133
00:06:26.673 --> 00:06:28.798
we take our relationship
to the next level.


134
00:06:30.298 --> 00:06:32.965
Oh, Paul, I don't know what to say.

135
00:06:33.048 --> 00:06:35.048
I feel exactly the same way.

136
00:06:35.131 --> 00:06:36.298
Really?

137
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:38.090
That's wonderful.

138
00:06:38.173 --> 00:06:39.256
So,

139
00:06:39.756 --> 00:06:41.881
will you work with
me on my next book?

140
00:06:42.881 --> 00:06:45.756
I want to bring you in
from the conception of the story.


141
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.131
I know you wanted to write your own novel.
I can help you with that.


142
00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:52.256
But do you think it could wait
just... a little longer?


143
00:06:53.256 --> 00:06:54.381
Oh, I, uh...

144
00:06:55.756 --> 00:06:57.173
- Sure.
- Great!


145
00:06:57.256 --> 00:06:58.715
- Sounds great.
- Wonderful!


146
00:06:58.798 --> 00:07:00.131
- Yeah.
- Well...


147
00:07:00.215 --> 00:07:02.840
Right, time to feed me to the wolves.

148
00:07:06.423 --> 00:07:07.423
See you in there.

149
00:07:09.673 --> 00:07:12.090
Well, if you stop moving, 
I can grab it.

150
00:07:12.173 --> 00:07:14.173
Just get me to the bathroom.

151
00:07:14.256 --> 00:07:16.590
Oh, I'm so sorry. 
Are you all right?

152
00:07:16.673 --> 00:07:18.756
We're just having
a minor eyelash malfunction.


153
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.548
May I offer my assistance?

154
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:23.590
Oh, uh, yeah. Maybe.
They're the new NanoGrip lashes.


155
00:07:23.673 --> 00:07:25.340
I'm a stylist at Bergdorf's.

156
00:07:25.423 --> 00:07:28.381
I get the latest samples
of all their luxury cosmetics.


157
00:07:28.465 --> 00:07:30.465
This one gets a thumbs-down.

158
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.298
- Do you mind if I give it a go?
- Sure.


159
00:07:35.673 --> 00:07:38.340
I'll be very, very careful.

160
00:07:40.173 --> 00:07:41.173
There.

161
00:07:41.923 --> 00:07:42.923
How's that?

162
00:07:43.923 --> 00:07:45.006
Much better.

163
00:07:46.381 --> 00:07:47.715
Um, hey.

164
00:07:47.798 --> 00:07:50.478
Hate to break this up, but you have
a lot of people waiting for you.


165
00:07:50.548 --> 00:07:53.173
- Okay, well, after you.
- Oh no, after you.


166
00:07:54.298 --> 00:07:55.298
Ugh.

167
00:07:55.756 --> 00:07:57.965
"She peers up from the watery depths."

168
00:07:58.756 --> 00:08:01.006
"If only he would reach out for her,

169
00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:03.631
it could break the spell."

170
00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:07.298
"But instead, he turns his back."

171
00:08:07.381 --> 00:08:10.506
"She calls out with drowned words

172
00:08:11.423 --> 00:08:14.548
as he disappears
into the shadows of the mossy glen."


173
00:08:25.006 --> 00:08:26.006
"Chapter eight."

174
00:08:27.798 --> 00:08:30.965
"The first night
she spent alone was the worst."


175
00:08:31.048 --> 00:08:32.381
TWO IRISH HEARTS
PAUL KENNEDY


176
00:08:33.173 --> 00:08:36.131
There you go, Gertrude.
That's a beautiful name, by the way.


177
00:08:36.215 --> 00:08:37.506
Thank you, Paul.

178
00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.298
- So, how did you three meet?
- Oh, we're friends from school.


179
00:08:43.173 --> 00:08:45.298
I was always a big reader.

180
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:46.548
What?

181
00:08:46.631 --> 00:08:47.631
That was me.

182
00:08:48.798 --> 00:08:51.756
- Would you like me to sign your book?
- Oh, uh, yes, I would.


183
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.715
Of course.

184
00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:55.173
- Here we go.
- Is that a real lake?


185
00:08:55.256 --> 00:08:58.381
Yes. It's in Ireland.
It's not far from my family's home.


186
00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:01.381
Hmm, well, I'd love to see it sometime.

187
00:09:02.381 --> 00:09:04.548
And I would love
for you to see it sometime.


188
00:09:05.423 --> 00:09:09.256
You write such amazing stories.
I could listen to them all night.


189
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.840
Wow.

190
00:09:10.923 --> 00:09:12.256
Wouldn't that be great?

191
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.506
Unfortunately,
Paul has press in the morning, so...


192
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.673
Check, please.

193
00:09:15.756 --> 00:09:17.673
- It's an open bar.
- No, it's not.


194
00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.423
It was amazing.

195
00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:23.673
Yes.

196
00:09:23.756 --> 00:09:26.798
This might have been
the most incredible night of my life.


197
00:09:26.881 --> 00:09:28.590
You and Paul seemed to hit it off.

198
00:09:28.673 --> 00:09:31.423
I know, it's like we had
this immediate connection.


199
00:09:31.506 --> 00:09:34.673
Well, you can't take it too seriously.
Paul's a famous person.


200
00:09:34.756 --> 00:09:38.131
- He's used to making people feel special.
- Well, he signed my book.


201
00:09:38.215 --> 00:09:39.715
He signs a lot of books.

202
00:09:39.798 --> 00:09:41.256
With his phone number?

203
00:09:44.923 --> 00:09:46.256
It's just a phone number.

204
00:09:46.756 --> 00:09:48.631
It's not like it's a proposal.

205
00:09:53.006 --> 00:09:55.798
I can't believe Paul and Emma
are getting married.


206
00:09:55.881 --> 00:09:57.090
It all happened so fast.

207
00:09:57.673 --> 00:09:58.673
Like whiplash.

208
00:09:59.048 --> 00:10:00.048
Welcome to Ireland.

209
00:10:00.131 --> 00:10:01.256
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


210
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.173
Nearly there. You've got one more bag.

211
00:10:05.256 --> 00:10:07.048
Oh Paul, that one's mine too.

212
00:10:07.131 --> 00:10:09.548
- There you go.
- Did you bring enough luggage, Em?


213
00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:10.965
I'm getting married.

214
00:10:11.048 --> 00:10:14.256
You won't believe the number
of wardrobe changes I'm gonna need.


215
00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:16.381
Oh.

216
00:10:16.881 --> 00:10:18.673
Excuse me. Ma'am.

217
00:10:19.715 --> 00:10:21.006
- Mads.
- Excuse me.


218
00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:22.631
- Are you okay?
- Sure.


219
00:10:22.715 --> 00:10:24.548
Maddie, have you got your bag?

220
00:10:24.631 --> 00:10:25.673
Almost.

221
00:10:25.756 --> 00:10:28.173
- We'll meet you out front, okay?
- Okay.


222
00:10:28.798 --> 00:10:32.798
If you need me on that job,
I'm available at a moment's notice. Okay?


223
00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:35.131
Good. All right. 
Yeah, of course. Mm-hmm.

224
00:10:35.215 --> 00:10:36.256
Yeah.

225
00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.340
- Oh.
- Oh, sorry. This is mine.


226
00:10:38.423 --> 00:10:41.131
Uh, no, I'm afraid it's mine.

227
00:10:41.215 --> 00:10:43.756
- No, actually it's mine.
- Hang on a minute.


228
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.090
There's an American woman
trying to steal my bag.


229
00:10:46.173 --> 00:10:48.381
I'm not. I'm trying to take my bag.

230
00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:50.923
If you just look
at the tag, you'll see.

231
00:10:51.006 --> 00:10:53.131
I don't need to. 
I know my own bag.

232
00:10:53.215 --> 00:10:54.048
So let go.

233
00:10:54.131 --> 00:10:55.673
I'm not letting go of my bag.

234
00:10:56.298 --> 00:10:57.381
Oh!

235
00:10:57.965 --> 00:10:59.798
See? Look, my favorite plaid skirt.

236
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.506
Are you sure those are your size?

237
00:11:05.965 --> 00:11:07.173
I'm so sorry.

238
00:11:07.256 --> 00:11:10.090
It's quite all right.
It could have happened to anyone.


239
00:11:10.173 --> 00:11:13.173
Although I suspect
it happens to you more often than most.


240
00:11:17.715 --> 00:11:18.881
- Enjoy your visit.
- Hmm.


241
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:24.673
LOST LUGGAGE

242
00:11:24.756 --> 00:11:26.715
Ah, Maddie. There you are.

243
00:11:26.798 --> 00:11:29.756
We finally managed to get
all of Emma's bags into the car.


244
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.506
I may have to ride on the roof.

245
00:11:34.423 --> 00:11:37.631
- Can't believe this is actually happening.
- I know. How are you feeling?


246
00:11:37.715 --> 00:11:38.965
No cold feet, right?

247
00:11:39.048 --> 00:11:40.590
Me? Never.

248
00:11:41.173 --> 00:11:43.840
I can't thank you enough
for introducing me to Emma.


249
00:11:43.923 --> 00:11:46.715
You've changed my life,
and I'll never forget it.


250
00:11:46.798 --> 00:11:48.673
Can you please fill this out?

251
00:11:49.256 --> 00:11:51.173
Looks like this is gonna take a while.

252
00:11:51.256 --> 00:11:54.506
- Why don't you guys head to the house?
- No. I can't leave you here.


253
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.173
- Don't worry about me. I'll take a taxi.
- Okay.


254
00:11:58.756 --> 00:12:00.715
Call me, let me know everything's okay.

255
00:12:00.798 --> 00:12:01.798
Good.

256
00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:10.590
"No Ubers in the area." Great.

257
00:12:20.256 --> 00:12:21.840
Can you go to this address?

258
00:12:21.923 --> 00:12:23.923
Oh, yeah. I can take you there, love.

259
00:12:24.006 --> 00:12:25.215
- Okay.
- Yeah.


260
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.631
Whoa, whoa! Wait, wait, wait!

261
00:12:30.548 --> 00:12:32.631
Billy. Oh, good to see you again.

262
00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:38.715
Ah.

263
00:12:39.173 --> 00:12:41.548
Couldn't convince anyone else
to give you their bag?


264
00:12:42.048 --> 00:12:45.506
As a matter of fact, my bag is missing,
but they'll call me when they find it.


265
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.590
Well, if you're in need of boxer shorts,
you know who to ask.


266
00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:17.090
So, you're a photographer?

267
00:13:17.173 --> 00:13:18.215
I am.

268
00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:19.673
A nature photographer.

269
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.298
Well, at least I'm trying to be.

270
00:13:22.381 --> 00:13:26.590
It's a little trickier now the whole world
carries a camera in their pocket.


271
00:13:26.673 --> 00:13:28.298
Never thought about that.

272
00:13:29.548 --> 00:13:31.965
- What brings you to Ireland?
- A wedding.


273
00:13:32.048 --> 00:13:34.673
- Oh, congratulations.
- Oh, no. It's... it's not mine.


274
00:13:34.756 --> 00:13:36.256
It's my friend's.

275
00:13:36.756 --> 00:13:38.590
Maybe you'll be lucky
to catch the bouquet.


276
00:13:38.673 --> 00:13:40.756
What makes you think
I wanna get married?


277
00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.840
Nothing. It was a joke.

278
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.256
Apparently, a bad one.

279
00:13:49.798 --> 00:13:50.965
Oh!

280
00:13:51.048 --> 00:13:52.131
TWO IRISH HEARTS

281
00:13:52.215 --> 00:13:53.215
Oh.

282
00:13:55.923 --> 00:13:56.923
Huh.

283
00:13:58.298 --> 00:13:59.798
- Thanks.
- All right.


284
00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.006
You enjoying that?

285
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.548
Yes. Have you read it?

286
00:14:03.631 --> 00:14:04.798
Nope. Don't need to.

287
00:14:05.881 --> 00:14:08.423
I barely made it through his last one.

288
00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:11.590
Paul Kennedy's one
of the best-selling authors in the UK.


289
00:14:11.673 --> 00:14:14.673
They sell a lot of fish and chips too.
Doesn't mean they're any good.


290
00:14:15.256 --> 00:14:19.131
Well, he seems to be doing
very well without your approval.


291
00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.048
Not a friend of yours, is he?

292
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.881
Your stop coming up, Miss.
Kennedy House.


293
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:27.590
Ah.

294
00:14:28.131 --> 00:14:29.131
As in Paul?

295
00:14:30.965 --> 00:14:33.006
Well, that answers that question.

296
00:14:38.256 --> 00:14:40.340
- Thank you.
- No bother, love.


297
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:44.506
Oh, and, FYI, I edited this book.

298
00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:46.548
So, what do you
have to say to that?

299
00:14:46.631 --> 00:14:47.840
My deepest sympathies.

300
00:14:48.423 --> 00:14:50.131
You know what? 
You can just go...

301
00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:24.923
Hey, you.

302
00:15:25.798 --> 00:15:28.423
- You're trespassing, you know.
- Uh, I'm sorry.


303
00:15:28.506 --> 00:15:30.173
I'm
-I'm looking for Paul Kennedy.

304
00:15:30.256 --> 00:15:32.465
I know who you are.
Just having a bit of fun.


305
00:15:32.548 --> 00:15:33.965
I'm Kory, the brother.

306
00:15:34.048 --> 00:15:36.340
- Hi.
- Come on, everyone's inside.


307
00:15:36.423 --> 00:15:38.090
Oh, Maddie! You made it!

308
00:15:38.173 --> 00:15:40.673
Yeah, I took the bus, which was fine,

309
00:15:40.756 --> 00:15:43.631
except for the cheeky English guy
I had to ride with.


310
00:15:47.298 --> 00:15:50.923
Olivia, this china is divine.

311
00:15:51.006 --> 00:15:53.631
You have an excellent eye. It's Belleek.

312
00:15:53.715 --> 00:15:55.881
- Oh.
- It's been in the family for generations.


313
00:15:55.965 --> 00:15:57.673
Just this way.

314
00:15:59.006 --> 00:16:00.256
Oh wow.

315
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.715
This place looks like a fairy tale.

316
00:16:03.798 --> 00:16:06.256
Except around here,
if you lose your shoe at midnight,


317
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.340
you're just drunk.

318
00:16:08.715 --> 00:16:10.298
He's so cute.

319
00:16:10.381 --> 00:16:13.340
- Wow, really?
- I've got Maddie here. Fresh off the bus.


320
00:16:13.423 --> 00:16:14.482
- Hey, Maddie.
- Good.


321
00:16:14.506 --> 00:16:16.215
- Sean. Paul's dad.
- Hi.


322
00:16:17.131 --> 00:16:18.715
Oh, no!

323
00:16:19.798 --> 00:16:21.798
Um, I'm so sorry.

324
00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:23.298
Quite all right.

325
00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:24.881
- No damage done.
- Yes, sir.


326
00:16:24.965 --> 00:16:27.256
Have they found your luggage?

327
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.090
- No, not yet.
- Come join us.


328
00:16:29.173 --> 00:16:30.631
Oh, Mads, I'm sorry.

329
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.340
It's okay.

330
00:16:32.381 --> 00:16:33.506
It was insured.

331
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.881
It's not the bag we're worried about.
It's the bridesmaid's dress.


332
00:16:36.965 --> 00:16:39.798
Without it, you'll imbalance
the look of the wedding party.


333
00:16:39.881 --> 00:16:43.923
Maybe she could stand-off to one side.
You know, like a cheering section.


334
00:16:45.923 --> 00:16:48.298
Right! The car is loaded up.

335
00:16:48.381 --> 00:16:49.256
Ah.

336
00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.590
Madeline. Everybody about ready to go?

337
00:16:51.673 --> 00:16:53.631
- Oh yeah.
- Where are we going?


338
00:16:53.715 --> 00:16:57.631
Paul's planned a surprise trip for us all.
Isn't he sweet?


339
00:16:57.715 --> 00:16:58.881
Mwah.

340
00:16:58.965 --> 00:17:00.732
- Just give me a sec to get changed.
- Mm-hmm.


341
00:17:00.756 --> 00:17:02.631
Such a lovely young woman.

342
00:17:02.715 --> 00:17:04.256
She's adorable.

343
00:17:04.923 --> 00:17:07.381
Madeline, you must be
so thrilled for them both.


344
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:09.840
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

345
00:17:10.465 --> 00:17:13.215
SCRUFFY MURPHY'S PUB & INN

346
00:17:16.465 --> 00:17:18.256
You all right? Good.

347
00:17:21.048 --> 00:17:22.798
Afternoon. How are we, chaps?

348
00:17:23.506 --> 00:17:24.506
That looks good.

349
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:25.715
Ah.

350
00:17:25.798 --> 00:17:28.048
There's the world traveler.

351
00:17:28.756 --> 00:17:30.465
Good to see you, Murphy.

352
00:17:31.048 --> 00:17:33.340
Doing well? How's it going?

353
00:17:33.423 --> 00:17:37.090
Oh, fine, fine. So, are you around
for a week this time?


354
00:17:37.173 --> 00:17:40.131
I am. Yeah, I'm covering
the sheep-shearing festival.


355
00:17:40.215 --> 00:17:43.006
Oh, there's great excitement
around here for that one.


356
00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.631
I'm sure.

357
00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:46.798
Now Fionnuala is getting your room ready,

358
00:17:46.881 --> 00:17:50.006
and you can use
my old Triumph while you're here.


359
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.256
No, no, no, no. 
I can't take your car.

360
00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:55.506
Look, you can trade me
with one of your fancy photographs.


361
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:57.215
And I'll hang it up in the pub.

362
00:17:57.298 --> 00:17:59.131
All right, deal.

363
00:17:59.215 --> 00:18:00.673
You're still liking it?

364
00:18:00.756 --> 00:18:03.256
All this gallivanting around the world?

365
00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.298
Snapping pictures
of lizards and birds, huh?


366
00:18:06.381 --> 00:18:07.215
I am.

367
00:18:07.298 --> 00:18:08.965
If you don't stay put,

368
00:18:09.048 --> 00:18:12.506
how are you going to find
a nice woman to settle down with you?


369
00:18:13.548 --> 00:18:16.298
I'm not sure I'm cut out
for settling down with anyone.


370
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:20.006
What am I telling you for?
You've never listened to me anyway.


371
00:18:21.715 --> 00:18:23.840
- Good to see you, man.
- All right.


372
00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:36.048
Beautiful.

373
00:18:43.631 --> 00:18:47.090
Hey! You need anything?
I can lend you some clothes.


374
00:18:47.173 --> 00:18:49.631
- No, I'm good. I had a sweater in my bag.
- Okay.


375
00:18:49.715 --> 00:18:51.965
- Gorgeous view.
- Yep.


376
00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:55.590
Is everything okay with you?
You seem a little off.


377
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.881
Yeah. No, uh, I'm good. I'm great.

378
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.173
Why don't we have a girls' night?
We can go out, get a couple drinks,


379
00:19:03.256 --> 00:19:04.715
meet some guys.

380
00:19:04.798 --> 00:19:08.298
You haven't dated in almost a year
since you started writing that book.


381
00:19:09.215 --> 00:19:11.881
- Just say yes. Come on, come on!
- Yes.


382
00:19:11.965 --> 00:19:14.756
Thank you. I'll see you downstairs in 15.

383
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.506
- Happy couple taking us on a picnic.
- Ugh.


384
00:19:33.173 --> 00:19:34.173
Thank you.

385
00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:37.631
- I'll take the basket.
- Lovely. I'll take the heavy thing.


386
00:19:37.715 --> 00:19:40.006
Right, follow me. 
Let's have a picnic.

387
00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.548
It's so pretty here.

388
00:19:42.131 --> 00:19:44.006
This bridge was used by the Vikings.

389
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.256
This must be where
you get all your creative inspiration.


390
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.256
Look, it's Lough Tay.

391
00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.173
- It's the lake from Paul's book.
- Ah.


392
00:19:51.756 --> 00:19:53.423
Oh, it's beautiful.

393
00:19:53.923 --> 00:19:56.006
Is this where your mystical fairy lives,

394
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.048
in a sunken city
at the bottom of the lake?


395
00:19:58.131 --> 00:20:01.590
- Yeah, exactly. You're so perceptive.
- Except she's not mystical.


396
00:20:01.673 --> 00:20:05.131
She's wicked and selfish,
and she lures men to their watery deaths.


397
00:20:05.215 --> 00:20:06.881
- Maddie!
- No, that's right.


398
00:20:07.423 --> 00:20:09.340
Evil fairy.

399
00:20:09.423 --> 00:20:11.048
Anyone fancy a boat trip?

400
00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:12.298
- Oh!
- I do.


401
00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:15.881
Nevin put some boats aside for us.

402
00:20:17.173 --> 00:20:19.881
- Maddie, come on, we can squeeze you in.
- Oh, it's okay.


403
00:20:19.965 --> 00:20:22.173
There's plenty of room. It'll be fun.

404
00:20:22.256 --> 00:20:25.048
- I'm just gonna go for a walk.
- Really? Okay.


405
00:20:25.131 --> 00:20:26.631
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.


406
00:20:26.715 --> 00:20:28.756
- Could we get a picture?
- Oh, okay.


407
00:20:31.298 --> 00:20:32.607
- Cheese!
- Woo-hoo!


408
00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:34.548
How about one of Paul and I?

409
00:20:34.631 --> 00:20:38.715
Here, use my phone.
That way, I can post on my stories later.


410
00:20:38.798 --> 00:20:41.298
Okay. Uh, one, two, three.

411
00:20:42.506 --> 00:20:44.274
- Think the water's warm?
- Here you go.


412
00:20:44.298 --> 00:20:45.381
Thank you, Mads.

413
00:20:46.965 --> 00:20:49.340
- I am so excited by this.
- All right, have fun.


414
00:20:49.423 --> 00:20:51.256
- See you later.
- Enjoy your walk.


415
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.923
- And we're off.
- Oh, it's lovely.


416
00:20:54.006 --> 00:20:55.215
I'm counting on you.

417
00:20:55.298 --> 00:20:56.381
Bye, guys.

418
00:20:56.465 --> 00:20:58.173
- See you, Maddie!
- Bye!


419
00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.340
We're off.

420
00:21:43.298 --> 00:21:46.423
- Hi, Mom.
<i>- You promised you'd call when you landed.</i>


421
00:21:46.506 --> 00:21:48.506
Sorry. I am safe and sound.

422
00:21:49.006 --> 00:21:53.006
Actually, Paul took us to Lough Tay.
It's really magical in person.


423
00:21:53.506 --> 00:21:55.881
Is there something in your voice?
Are you all right?


424
00:21:55.965 --> 00:21:58.048
<i>Yeah, I'm okay, but...</i>

425
00:21:58.131 --> 00:22:00.340
I can't help but think
that things would be different


426
00:22:00.423 --> 00:22:03.256
if I'd just taken your advice
and told Paul how I felt.


427
00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.173
<i>Sweetheart,
think of this as a lesson learned.</i>


428
00:22:06.756 --> 00:22:09.340
You're gonna have
to start speaking up for yourself.


429
00:22:09.423 --> 00:22:10.590
Stop that.

430
00:22:10.673 --> 00:22:11.673
<i>Yeah, well,</i>

431
00:22:11.756 --> 00:22:13.340
it's too late now.

432
00:22:13.423 --> 00:22:16.756
It's not like I can tell Paul
I wish he was marrying me instead of Emma.


433
00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.048
<i>Maddie?</i>

434
00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:20.298
- Mom?
- Maddie? Maddie?


435
00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:23.090
Mom, it's... it's reconnecting.

436
00:22:23.173 --> 00:22:24.173
Mom?

437
00:22:25.131 --> 00:22:26.131
Oh! Whoa!

438
00:22:27.381 --> 00:22:29.381
Was that a wish you were making?

439
00:22:29.465 --> 00:22:30.923
Oh, no, I was just, um...

440
00:22:31.006 --> 00:22:33.340
I mean, I guess,
but I didn't think anyone was listening.


441
00:22:34.006 --> 00:22:35.006
Well, I was.

442
00:22:35.506 --> 00:22:36.506
Look down.

443
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:38.590
Okay.

444
00:22:38.923 --> 00:22:42.506
They call that a wishing chair,
but you have to do it right.


445
00:22:43.506 --> 00:22:47.506
So, sit down,
close your eyes and make your wish.


446
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.881
Oh, no, I'm good.

447
00:22:49.798 --> 00:22:51.006
What are you afraid of?

448
00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.423
I'm not afraid. I just...
I don't believe in that kind of thing.


449
00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:56.673
Well, then you have nothing to lose.

450
00:22:56.756 --> 00:22:58.923
Oh, come on. Why
not give it a go?

451
00:23:00.381 --> 00:23:01.381
Okay, I wish...

452
00:23:01.465 --> 00:23:03.590
No, you have to
do it right. Sit down.

453
00:23:05.923 --> 00:23:08.673
Close your eyes and mean it.

454
00:23:12.381 --> 00:23:14.131
Okay, I wish...

455
00:23:17.215 --> 00:23:19.965
I wish I was marrying Paul Kennedy.

456
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.298
Oh.

457
00:23:24.381 --> 00:23:26.381
Well, that didn't work.

458
00:23:26.465 --> 00:23:28.715
Didn't it? And how can you tell?

459
00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:32.631
Isn't there supposed to be an earthquake
or a lightning bolt or something?


460
00:23:32.715 --> 00:23:34.881
So you want something more theatrical?

461
00:23:34.965 --> 00:23:39.465
Let me see if I can muster up
a stiff breeze. Would that help?


462
00:23:40.048 --> 00:23:41.173
That would be nice.

463
00:23:48.631 --> 00:23:49.923
Whoa!

464
00:23:50.006 --> 00:23:51.006
Oh!

465
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:53.506
Oh!

466
00:24:21.298 --> 00:24:23.381
That was a weird dream.

467
00:24:26.923 --> 00:24:27.923
Hello?

468
00:24:30.131 --> 00:24:31.131
Hello?

469
00:24:32.381 --> 00:24:33.423
Heather?

470
00:24:33.965 --> 00:24:34.965
Emma?

471
00:24:35.881 --> 00:24:36.881
Are you in there?

472
00:24:38.756 --> 00:24:40.506
Paul!

473
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:43.423
Ah, Maddie, you're up.
Can you hand me a towel?


474
00:24:43.506 --> 00:24:45.465
Uh, sure.

475
00:24:45.548 --> 00:24:47.048
Yeah. Okay. Um...

476
00:24:48.298 --> 00:24:50.923
Um, Paul, what are you doing in here?

477
00:24:51.006 --> 00:24:53.726
Taking a shower. What does it look like?
Have you seen my beard balm?


478
00:24:53.798 --> 00:24:54.715
No!

479
00:24:54.798 --> 00:24:56.465
Ow! Oh!

480
00:24:56.548 --> 00:24:57.756
What's wrong with you?

481
00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.923
Nothing, I just, um...
I didn't know you were in here.


482
00:25:01.006 --> 00:25:03.006
- Where else would I be?
- Right. Okay.


483
00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:05.798
Oh! Uh, I'm
-I'm gonna go. Right. So sorry.

484
00:25:09.506 --> 00:25:10.881
Whoa! Oh!

485
00:25:11.715 --> 00:25:13.423
Maddie! Are you all right?

486
00:25:13.923 --> 00:25:16.131
- They found my suitcase.
- Come here.


487
00:25:16.215 --> 00:25:17.798
Huh!

488
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.965
You know what? I'm gonna go outside.
I'll just... Yeah, I'm gonna get some air.


489
00:25:29.798 --> 00:25:31.840
- Oh, morning, Mads.
- Hi, Emma.


490
00:25:32.673 --> 00:25:34.381
Emma! You're up early.

491
00:25:34.881 --> 00:25:37.256
I'll get a run in before breakfast.
Have you seen Paul?


492
00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.006
- Paul?
- I've been looking for him everywhere.


493
00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:42.173
You know, you can
get lost in this house.

494
00:25:42.256 --> 00:25:46.090
Yeah, well, uh,
he is definitely not in there. At all.


495
00:25:46.173 --> 00:25:47.631
- Right.
- You know what?


496
00:25:47.715 --> 00:25:50.923
As a matter of fact, I haven't seen
an inch of him anywhere.


497
00:25:51.506 --> 00:25:53.673
What? How did he get in there?

498
00:25:53.756 --> 00:25:55.066
- Morning, Emma.
- Morning.


499
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:58.173
- Your mother's looking for you downstairs.
- Oh. Great, thanks.


500
00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:01.215
- I'll see you at breakfast?
- Whoa. Paul.


501
00:26:01.298 --> 00:26:04.173
What? It's not like
she's never seen us kiss before.


502
00:26:04.256 --> 00:26:05.590
Nevin, my jacket.

503
00:26:08.423 --> 00:26:10.840
So, uh, getting ready
for the big day, huh?


504
00:26:10.923 --> 00:26:12.340
You must be getting excited.

505
00:26:12.423 --> 00:26:14.631
I'm looking forward to the reception.

506
00:26:14.715 --> 00:26:17.506
There are some seriously hot men
in this town.


507
00:26:18.131 --> 00:26:19.006
See?

508
00:26:20.798 --> 00:26:22.090
Oh.

509
00:26:23.006 --> 00:26:25.256
- Oh. Hey, are you...
- I need to talk to you.


510
00:26:26.256 --> 00:26:29.048
What in the world, Mads? 
What is wrong?

511
00:26:29.131 --> 00:26:30.340
I'm gonna tell you something,

512
00:26:30.423 --> 00:26:33.465
but you cannot breathe
a word of this to Emma.


513
00:26:33.548 --> 00:26:35.090
Oh. All right.

514
00:26:35.673 --> 00:26:38.090
Last night, I had the craziest dream.

515
00:26:38.173 --> 00:26:41.465
We were by the lake,
and this odd lady told me to make a wish.


516
00:26:41.965 --> 00:26:44.881
And I wished
that I was marrying Paul Kennedy.


517
00:26:46.173 --> 00:26:48.840
- I know that probably shocks you.
- Should it?


518
00:26:48.923 --> 00:26:49.923
Well, anyway,

519
00:26:49.965 --> 00:26:54.631
when I woke up from the dream,
my suitcase magically appeared,


520
00:26:55.756 --> 00:26:58.840
and Paul was taking a shower. In there!

521
00:26:59.423 --> 00:27:00.506
Okay.

522
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.381
Isn't that a bit weird to you?

523
00:27:02.465 --> 00:27:03.923
Uh...

524
00:27:05.673 --> 00:27:07.798
And there's a wedding dress
in my suitcase!


525
00:27:07.881 --> 00:27:08.881
Uh, yeah.

526
00:27:09.506 --> 00:27:12.340
- Why is it in there?
- Because it's yours, silly.


527
00:27:12.423 --> 00:27:14.131
You and your mom
picked it out in New York.


528
00:27:14.215 --> 00:27:15.131
What?

529
00:27:15.215 --> 00:27:16.965
Yeah, and in a couple of days,

530
00:27:17.048 --> 00:27:20.131
you're gonna put it on,
walk down the aisle, and get married!


531
00:27:20.215 --> 00:27:21.506
No, I'm not!

532
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:22.840
Yes, you are.

533
00:27:22.923 --> 00:27:25.423
I think you're having
a little pre-wedding anxiety.


534
00:27:25.506 --> 00:27:27.673
- Perfectly normal.
- I mean, what are these?


535
00:27:27.756 --> 00:27:28.756
These aren't mine.

536
00:27:28.798 --> 00:27:31.131
Girl, sexy heels for your honeymoon.

537
00:27:33.006 --> 00:27:35.715
No. I am not the one
who's getting married.


538
00:27:35.798 --> 00:27:36.840
She is!

539
00:27:37.756 --> 00:27:39.215
Exactly.

540
00:27:40.756 --> 00:27:43.673
You, my friend, are marrying Paul Kennedy.

541
00:27:43.756 --> 00:27:45.256
Now, just breathe. Relax.

542
00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.465
This is gonna be
the best weekend of your life.


543
00:27:47.548 --> 00:27:48.548
Get dressed.

544
00:27:52.465 --> 00:27:54.090
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy.

545
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.590
Yes!

546
00:27:57.215 --> 00:27:59.173
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy!

547
00:27:59.256 --> 00:28:00.256
Ah!

548
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:01.756
Whoo! Yes!

549
00:28:15.923 --> 00:28:18.715
- Okay, so...
- Well, I just don't understand it.


550
00:28:18.798 --> 00:28:21.715
Why can I not find
a photographer for this wedding?


551
00:28:21.798 --> 00:28:24.048
Because you're horrible, Mum.

552
00:28:24.131 --> 00:28:27.673
The last two photographers
you hired for our parties left in tears.


553
00:28:29.298 --> 00:28:30.965
- Did they really?
- Yes.


554
00:28:31.048 --> 00:28:33.090
They did. They were crying and everything.

555
00:28:33.756 --> 00:28:35.840
Oh, there she is.

556
00:28:36.798 --> 00:28:39.381
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning.


557
00:28:42.048 --> 00:28:43.840
I'm digging this groove.

558
00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:46.048
Uh, darling?

559
00:28:46.881 --> 00:28:47.923
Oh.

560
00:28:48.006 --> 00:28:49.006
Allow me.

561
00:28:49.631 --> 00:28:50.798
Thank you.

562
00:28:50.881 --> 00:28:54.465
- Are you feeling all right, Madeline?
- Yes. Just a little jet-lagged.


563
00:28:54.548 --> 00:28:56.965
Have some champagne. 
It's working for me.

564
00:28:59.131 --> 00:28:59.965
Thank you.

565
00:29:00.048 --> 00:29:03.048
Try these local woodland strawberries.
They're delicious.


566
00:29:03.131 --> 00:29:05.048
Let me give you one. Very good.

567
00:29:08.673 --> 00:29:11.590
- None for me, thank you.
- Madeline might want one.


568
00:29:11.673 --> 00:29:13.340
Madeline, would you like a boxty?

569
00:29:13.423 --> 00:29:14.590
A what?

570
00:29:14.673 --> 00:29:17.590
Oh, she's so adorable.
Um, it's an Irish pancake.


571
00:29:17.673 --> 00:29:18.715
Oh, okay, thank you.

572
00:29:18.798 --> 00:29:21.048
Sean, I meant to tell you.
The bakery called.


573
00:29:21.131 --> 00:29:24.048
The wedding cake we ordered
is too tall for the delivery truck.


574
00:29:24.131 --> 00:29:26.298
- Oh, no.
- Could you get a smaller cake?


575
00:29:26.381 --> 00:29:27.256
Very good.

576
00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:29.965
- I like your thinking.
- Well done, dear.


577
00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.090
Finally, someone with some sense.

578
00:29:33.798 --> 00:29:37.673
Well, the weather seems to be holding up.
You fancy a bike ride this morning?


579
00:29:39.923 --> 00:29:41.548
- Oh, with me?
- Mm-hmm.


580
00:29:41.631 --> 00:29:43.381
Of course with me.

581
00:29:44.131 --> 00:29:46.840
Emma and I are going down
to the orchard to pick some apples.


582
00:29:46.923 --> 00:29:50.506
- Kory, do you want to come with us?
- I can't. I've got rugby practice.


583
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:51.840
Paul, can we go pick apples?

584
00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:53.923
I'm not really
that coordinated on a bicycle.


585
00:29:54.006 --> 00:29:56.131
Don't be silly.
Everyone knows how to ride a bike.


586
00:30:01.715 --> 00:30:04.798
Sweetheart, can you
pick up the pace a little?


587
00:30:04.881 --> 00:30:06.090
Paul, I'm trying.

588
00:30:11.131 --> 00:30:13.173
These are so luscious.

589
00:30:14.798 --> 00:30:17.256
- Maddie, you still back there?
- I'm coming.


590
00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.673
- Oh, hey.
- Hi, ladies.


591
00:30:20.215 --> 00:30:21.131
Hey, Maddie.

592
00:30:22.381 --> 00:30:25.340
Whoa! Whoa!

593
00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:26.506
Ah!

594
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:28.131
Oh!

595
00:30:28.215 --> 00:30:30.756
- Maddie, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.


596
00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:34.631
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'll just hop back on.


597
00:30:34.715 --> 00:30:37.798
I don't know, you kind of look like
a liability on that thing.


598
00:30:37.881 --> 00:30:40.631
Oh, no, I'll just push it
and trot along next to you.


599
00:30:40.715 --> 00:30:43.423
Well, I was kind of hoping
to get some cardio in, babe.


600
00:30:43.506 --> 00:30:46.465
- It's okay. I'll take it from you, Maddie.
- No.


601
00:30:46.548 --> 00:30:48.256
Could use a bike ride.
I'm low on my steps.


602
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.881
- All right then!
- Alright.


603
00:30:49.965 --> 00:30:53.090
- Quick little trip around the village?
- Only if you can keep up with me.


604
00:30:53.756 --> 00:30:55.840
- Whoo!
- Them fighting words.


605
00:30:58.215 --> 00:31:00.090
Yeah, left you in my dust!

606
00:31:00.173 --> 00:31:01.756
I'm gonna get you.

607
00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.381
So, want to pick some apples?

608
00:31:04.465 --> 00:31:06.090
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.


609
00:31:07.506 --> 00:31:10.423
I literally cannot believe
we got so many apples.


610
00:31:10.506 --> 00:31:14.340
How about we make an apple pie for Kory?
Maybe he likes a girl that can bake.


611
00:31:15.465 --> 00:31:19.340
There you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere.


612
00:31:19.423 --> 00:31:21.923
Madeline, do you realize what time it is?

613
00:31:22.006 --> 00:31:25.673
We have an appointment at the tailor's
for the fitting of your wedding dress.


614
00:31:25.756 --> 00:31:29.840
Oh, but don't I already have a dress?
My mom and I picked it out together.


615
00:31:29.923 --> 00:31:31.340
Oh, speaking of your mother.

616
00:31:31.423 --> 00:31:34.223
Nevin will collect her from the airport
and bring her to the rehearsal.


617
00:31:34.298 --> 00:31:36.506
- My mother's coming?
- Better late than never.


618
00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.506
Yeah, I agree with you.

619
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:41.256
I don't see a problem
with guys using Botox.


620
00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.465
Right? I mean, I don't need it now,
but maybe in the future.


621
00:31:44.548 --> 00:31:45.548
Oh hey, Em.

622
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:46.881
- Hey.
- Hi.


623
00:31:46.965 --> 00:31:50.048
Paul, darling, I thought you told Madeline
about the wedding dress.


624
00:31:50.131 --> 00:31:51.131
I did.

625
00:31:51.756 --> 00:31:52.798
- Right, honey?
- No.


626
00:31:52.881 --> 00:31:54.381
Well, anyway, come on.

627
00:31:56.298 --> 00:31:59.006
- Well, she's no fun.
- My mom can handle her.


628
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.131
It fits her like a dream.

629
00:32:08.215 --> 00:32:09.840
Spectacular.

630
00:32:09.923 --> 00:32:11.006
Magnificent.

631
00:32:11.506 --> 00:32:13.090
- Wow.
- Wow.


632
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.423
My grandmother
wore that gown on her wedding day.


633
00:32:16.506 --> 00:32:18.465
So did my mother. So did I.

634
00:32:19.173 --> 00:32:21.381
It's a tradition in our family, Madeline.

635
00:32:21.465 --> 00:32:23.340
It's really... fun.

636
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.673
"Fun"?

637
00:32:24.756 --> 00:32:27.340
It's vintage Lanvin.

638
00:32:27.423 --> 00:32:32.423
It is a fashion artifact.
It is the sphinx of wedding gowns.


639
00:32:33.715 --> 00:32:35.131
Maybe you could add a slit?

640
00:32:36.673 --> 00:32:37.798
Hmm.

641
00:32:39.381 --> 00:32:41.173
Brilliant. They have it.

642
00:32:43.465 --> 00:32:44.840
REWILDING

643
00:32:44.923 --> 00:32:46.563
- Fantastic.
- It is lovely.


644
00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:48.590
THE NEW BESTSELLER
FROM PAUL KENNEDY


645
00:32:48.673 --> 00:32:49.673
- Hello.
- Hello.


646
00:32:49.756 --> 00:32:51.116
- Let me get you this.
- Thank you.


647
00:32:51.173 --> 00:32:53.506
Oh! Congratulations.

648
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.840
You are our 100th customer of the week.

649
00:32:56.923 --> 00:32:58.090
Oh. Wow.

650
00:32:58.173 --> 00:32:59.631
Which means you win

651
00:32:59.715 --> 00:33:04.090
a promotional copy
of Paul Kennedy's new novel.


652
00:33:04.881 --> 00:33:05.881
Uh...

653
00:33:06.465 --> 00:33:09.506
- That's okay. It's fine, thanks.
- But it's free.


654
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:11.048
Even so.

655
00:33:11.631 --> 00:33:12.631
There you go.

656
00:33:13.548 --> 00:33:14.381
Oh.

657
00:33:14.465 --> 00:33:16.423
- Little gift.
- Of course.


658
00:33:16.923 --> 00:33:18.715
- One of this.
- Lovely.


659
00:33:19.798 --> 00:33:22.631
Oh, and the payment. There you go.

660
00:33:22.715 --> 00:33:24.048
Perfect.

661
00:33:24.131 --> 00:33:26.215
- Have a good day.
- You too. Bye.


662
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:29.673
SHEEP SHEARING
FESTIVAL


663
00:33:29.756 --> 00:33:31.923
CANCELLED

664
00:33:34.423 --> 00:33:35.506
Oh!

665
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:37.006
- After you.
- Thank you.


666
00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:38.715
WEST COAST RARE BOOKS

667
00:33:41.548 --> 00:33:44.256
Oh, come on. You've got to be joking.

668
00:33:44.756 --> 00:33:46.465
I was looking forward to that gig.

669
00:33:47.673 --> 00:33:51.715
- It's really not that bad.
- Yes, it is. What are you talking about?


670
00:33:51.798 --> 00:33:56.048
- What are you gonna do about this, Maddie?
- Well, I'm just gonna wear the dress.


671
00:33:56.131 --> 00:33:59.256
Because it's only a dress
and because Paul wants me to.


672
00:33:59.340 --> 00:34:01.048
<i>And because you wished it.</i>

673
00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:02.423
Did you just hear that?

674
00:34:02.506 --> 00:34:03.840
There she is.

675
00:34:03.923 --> 00:34:05.643
That's her!
She's right there. There she is!


676
00:34:05.673 --> 00:34:06.965
Oh...

677
00:34:07.048 --> 00:34:09.256
Who? Maddie!

678
00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:13.840
Hey, wait, come back!

679
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:19.090
What does that mean?
I'm happy with my wish.


680
00:34:22.298 --> 00:34:24.840
<i>Are you really happy with your wish?</i>

681
00:34:26.006 --> 00:34:27.465
Where are you going?

682
00:34:28.131 --> 00:34:31.006
I love my wish.
Come back! Please don't take it away!


683
00:34:32.631 --> 00:34:33.756
Whoa!

684
00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:36.798
Hello.

685
00:34:36.881 --> 00:34:38.881
- It's you.
- You all right?


686
00:34:39.965 --> 00:34:44.090
- You didn't see me crossing the street?
- Well, yes, but you ran into me, so...


687
00:34:45.131 --> 00:34:46.756
- Well...
- There you go.


688
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:51.590
It's okay. I got it.

689
00:34:54.381 --> 00:34:55.840
- Here.
- Oh. Well done.


690
00:34:57.465 --> 00:34:58.465
Hey.

691
00:34:59.256 --> 00:35:01.048
You told me you didn't like Paul's books.

692
00:35:01.631 --> 00:35:03.673
- Sorry, what?
- When we were on the bus.


693
00:35:03.756 --> 00:35:06.840
I don't mean to be rude,
but do I know you?


694
00:35:06.923 --> 00:35:07.965
You don't remember?

695
00:35:09.298 --> 00:35:12.756
- Oh, that's because it didn't happen.
- What didn't happen?


696
00:35:13.256 --> 00:35:14.465
- Nothing.
- Maddie!


697
00:35:14.548 --> 00:35:18.131
- What was that about? You just ran off.
- I, um, I saw...


698
00:35:18.215 --> 00:35:22.715
You found one. A photographer.
Wonderful. Well done, Madeline.


699
00:35:22.798 --> 00:35:23.923
No, I...

700
00:35:24.006 --> 00:35:25.840
Olivia Kennedy. And you are?

701
00:35:26.423 --> 00:35:29.090
James. James Thomas. 
Lovely to meet you.

702
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:32.798
I don't suppose you're any relation
to Paul Kennedy, the author?


703
00:35:32.881 --> 00:35:33.798
That's my son.

704
00:35:33.881 --> 00:35:36.423
- Ah.
- This is his bride-to-be.


705
00:35:36.506 --> 00:35:39.340
- Of course you already knew that.
- I didn't, actually.


706
00:35:39.423 --> 00:35:42.256
The thing is,
James is not that kind of photographer.


707
00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.465
How do you know that?

708
00:35:44.048 --> 00:35:45.607
- You're a photographer?
- I am.


709
00:35:45.631 --> 00:35:46.840
What would you charge?

710
00:35:46.923 --> 00:35:50.298
I appreciate the offer,
but I don't think I'm the man for the job.


711
00:35:50.923 --> 00:35:52.090
What do you mean?

712
00:35:52.673 --> 00:35:54.215
I don't really photograph people.

713
00:35:55.423 --> 00:35:58.090
Whatever your fee is, 
I will triple it.

714
00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.715
When did you say the wedding was?

715
00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:06.340
You see how there's this beautiful glow
around the bride and groom.


716
00:36:06.423 --> 00:36:08.107
- It's lovely.
- That's what I'm looking for.


717
00:36:08.131 --> 00:36:09.215
Something ethereal.

718
00:36:09.298 --> 00:36:12.881
And then any photographs of me
should be taken from the right.


719
00:36:12.965 --> 00:36:14.215
That is my better side.

720
00:36:15.381 --> 00:36:16.215
All right.

721
00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.673
Whose car is in
the middle of the drive?

722
00:36:33.756 --> 00:36:34.965
Hey.

723
00:36:35.048 --> 00:36:37.006
Oh, good, darling. 
You're just in time.

724
00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:39.923
Madeline found
a wedding photographer for us.


725
00:36:40.006 --> 00:36:40.840
Oh!

726
00:36:40.923 --> 00:36:43.631
James Thomas, this is Paul, my fiancé.

727
00:36:43.715 --> 00:36:45.548
- I've read some of your work.
- Oh.


728
00:36:45.631 --> 00:36:48.756
- It's always nice to meet a fan.
- Yes, I'm sure it is.


729
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.881
You know, my publicist said

730
00:36:50.965 --> 00:36:54.131
that we should get
some PR pictures after the wedding


731
00:36:54.215 --> 00:36:57.173
of Madeline and I
in some idyllic Irish backdrops.


732
00:36:57.256 --> 00:36:59.715
He thinks it'll help
boost my sales figures.


733
00:36:59.798 --> 00:37:02.256
So not just a wedding
but a good PR event too.


734
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:03.215
Yeah, exactly.

735
00:37:03.298 --> 00:37:05.441
Especially since
Maddie is Paul's book editor.


736
00:37:05.465 --> 00:37:08.465
Why don't the three of you spend tomorrow
driving around the area?


737
00:37:08.548 --> 00:37:11.298
- You might find some great spots.
- That sounds wonderful.


738
00:37:11.381 --> 00:37:13.340
- What do you think, Paul?
- It's a great idea.


739
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:15.840
- 10:00 a.m., James?
- Sure.


740
00:37:15.923 --> 00:37:18.048
Madeline, would you mind
showing James out?


741
00:37:18.131 --> 00:37:19.131
Sure.

742
00:37:22.465 --> 00:37:25.381
So you're not just his fiancée
but his editor too.


743
00:37:26.006 --> 00:37:27.090
How convenient.

744
00:37:27.173 --> 00:37:30.423
If you're gonna spend the day with us,
can you leave your snark at home?


745
00:37:30.506 --> 00:37:34.090
Since I don't technically have a home,
I don't know where that would be.


746
00:37:36.298 --> 00:37:37.298
I'll do my best.

747
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.423
I suppose I should
be thanking you for the job.


748
00:37:43.465 --> 00:37:45.923
I don't mind saying
it's gonna come in very handy.


749
00:37:46.506 --> 00:37:48.673
Now that the world
has a camera in their pocket?


750
00:37:50.006 --> 00:37:51.173
It's what I always say.

751
00:37:51.256 --> 00:37:52.256
Really?

752
00:37:52.798 --> 00:37:53.798
Yeah.

753
00:37:56.256 --> 00:37:58.131
- See you in the morning.
- Yep.


754
00:38:27.798 --> 00:38:28.798
Hmm.

755
00:38:30.048 --> 00:38:31.256
Guess what?

756
00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.173
<i>You</i> are marrying Paul Kennedy.

757
00:38:35.506 --> 00:38:36.798
Oh! Yes!

758
00:38:55.881 --> 00:38:57.131
What the...

759
00:38:57.215 --> 00:38:58.506
Ow!

760
00:38:58.590 --> 00:38:59.881
Oh!

761
00:39:05.215 --> 00:39:07.506
- Paul?
- Maddie! What the hell?


762
00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:08.840
I'm sorry! I was asleep!

763
00:39:08.923 --> 00:39:09.965
God, that hurts.

764
00:39:10.048 --> 00:39:13.381
I didn't... It was a knee-jerk reaction.
Did I get you in the eye?


765
00:39:14.048 --> 00:39:15.965
You got a bit more than the eye.

766
00:39:16.048 --> 00:39:18.090
Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

767
00:39:18.173 --> 00:39:19.798
Don't... Don't touch me.

768
00:39:19.881 --> 00:39:21.256
- Okay.
- Okay?


769
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.840
- Yeah.
- Oh.


770
00:39:27.506 --> 00:39:28.506
I'm so sorry.

771
00:39:32.881 --> 00:39:34.215
Are you sure you're okay?

772
00:39:34.298 --> 00:39:37.131
- Oh, I'm tickety-boo.
- . Okay.


773
00:39:46.215 --> 00:39:48.673
- You're doing a grand job, mate.
- Thank you.


774
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:51.298
Ah. Morning.

775
00:39:52.131 --> 00:39:53.298
Where's Paul?

776
00:39:53.381 --> 00:39:54.881
Uh, he's not coming.

777
00:39:54.965 --> 00:39:55.881
Well, why not?

778
00:39:55.965 --> 00:39:57.673
He had a little late-night injury.

779
00:39:57.756 --> 00:39:59.340
He said we should scout locations.

780
00:39:59.423 --> 00:40:02.506
- Nothing serious, I hope?
- Oh, no, he just needs the ice.


781
00:40:03.548 --> 00:40:06.548
- What about your friends?
- Uh, they're getting mani-pedis.


782
00:40:09.548 --> 00:40:10.548
Ready?

783
00:40:28.881 --> 00:40:30.590
So how did you become an editor?

784
00:40:30.673 --> 00:40:35.006
Oh, well, I was a freelance writer,
but that wasn't really paying the bills.


785
00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:38.173
- Then I got a job at the publishing house.
- Ah, so that's how you met Paul.


786
00:40:38.756 --> 00:40:41.881
Yeah. He wasn't really clicking
with any of the other editors,


787
00:40:41.965 --> 00:40:44.506
and we were a good
fit right off the bat.

788
00:40:45.465 --> 00:40:46.465
That's interesting.

789
00:40:47.923 --> 00:40:48.923
What does that mean?

790
00:40:49.506 --> 00:40:51.506
I guess opposites attract.

791
00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:55.715
Excuse me, Paul and I are not opposites.
We have many things in common.


792
00:40:57.631 --> 00:41:00.631
I stand corrected.
I'm sure it's a long list of mutualities.


793
00:41:01.631 --> 00:41:05.090
Why don't we stay silent for a second?
That way I can enjoy the view.


794
00:41:06.006 --> 00:41:07.006
As you wish.

795
00:41:25.465 --> 00:41:27.631
DES MOINES,
IOWA


796
00:41:38.631 --> 00:41:41.965
- How about you?
- We don't need to talk about me.


797
00:41:42.048 --> 00:41:44.090
- Nice view though.
- Where are we going?


798
00:41:57.173 --> 00:42:00.215
- This is so pretty.
- Oh, it gets better. Come on.


799
00:42:04.006 --> 00:42:07.048
So... I've got to ask.

800
00:42:07.548 --> 00:42:08.673
Do you have to?

801
00:42:08.756 --> 00:42:10.465
- Go ahead.
- Okay.


802
00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:13.465
Why don't you write your own book?

803
00:42:15.381 --> 00:42:16.673
I've been trying,

804
00:42:17.256 --> 00:42:19.340
but it's been a bit difficult lately.

805
00:42:19.423 --> 00:42:22.173
Because you're too busy
working on Paul's book.


806
00:42:22.798 --> 00:42:24.131
No, I just...

807
00:42:25.298 --> 00:42:28.923
- I'm not sure I have anything to say now.
- Everyone has something to say.


808
00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:31.798
They just have to be
brave enough to say it.


809
00:42:32.548 --> 00:42:34.840
- Are you calling me a coward?
- Absolutely not.


810
00:42:34.923 --> 00:42:38.631
- You came up with that all by yourself.
- Okay.


811
00:42:42.131 --> 00:42:46.423
Right. Well, Paul said
he wanted some authentic Ireland.


812
00:42:46.506 --> 00:42:49.965
So, this is about
as authentic as it gets.

813
00:42:53.215 --> 00:42:54.215
Wow.

814
00:42:54.923 --> 00:42:56.465
It's the Cliffs of Moher.

815
00:42:57.381 --> 00:42:59.881
- You know it?
- I've heard about it.


816
00:43:04.131 --> 00:43:06.006
What do you think?

817
00:43:06.090 --> 00:43:08.631
I think I just stepped
into a James Joyce novel.


818
00:43:09.506 --> 00:43:11.256
That's not the reference I was expecting.

819
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.715
Joyce is my favorite author.

820
00:43:14.381 --> 00:43:15.381
Is he?

821
00:43:15.881 --> 00:43:16.881
Hmm.

822
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:20.631
Hey, you're pretty good.

823
00:43:21.131 --> 00:43:22.131
Thank you.

824
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:26.756
Unfortunately, I don't think
a rugged cliff is Paul's style.


825
00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.840
No. No, probably not.

826
00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:30.798
But is it yours?

827
00:43:31.923 --> 00:43:34.423
- Yeah, I think it's beautiful here.
- Yeah, me too.


828
00:43:34.923 --> 00:43:37.548
I'd love to get married up here.

829
00:43:38.673 --> 00:43:39.673
Why don't you?

830
00:43:40.631 --> 00:43:44.090
Because the wedding is this weekend,
and I don't want to be difficult.


831
00:43:44.173 --> 00:43:47.215
I'd hardly call having a voice
at your own wedding being difficult.


832
00:43:51.381 --> 00:43:54.381
Sorry, I just like to know
a little bit about my subjects


833
00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.340
before I photograph them, that's all.

834
00:43:57.215 --> 00:43:59.173
I thought you didn't photograph people.

835
00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:01.965
I'm willing to make an exception.

836
00:44:21.881 --> 00:44:24.048
I just don't understand it.

837
00:44:25.298 --> 00:44:26.298
Oh.

838
00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:28.715
- Wow.
- That was awful.


839
00:44:28.798 --> 00:44:30.256
This looks like fun.

840
00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.381
Heather, Emma. 
Come meet my mate, Finn.

841
00:44:32.465 --> 00:44:35.465
Hi, I'm also Paul's groomsman.
Nice to meet you.


842
00:44:35.548 --> 00:44:37.506
Paul, what happened to you?

843
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:39.548
Well, it's a long story.

844
00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:41.715
I'm trying to minimize the damage.

845
00:44:41.798 --> 00:44:43.006
Look.

846
00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.006
Do you think it'll show in the photos?

847
00:44:45.090 --> 00:44:47.006
I have an amazing concealer
you can borrow.


848
00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:49.173
That'd be great. Thanks.

849
00:44:50.631 --> 00:44:53.673
Heather, I was talking to Kory
about the big wedding aisle walk.


850
00:44:53.756 --> 00:44:56.215
Should we all practice,
so we can make a splashy entrance?


851
00:44:56.298 --> 00:44:58.090
I've got my eye on you, Finn.

852
00:44:58.173 --> 00:45:01.715
- He's trying to steal my spotlight.
- I got moves, Paul. I ain't gonna lie.


853
00:45:03.048 --> 00:45:06.756
Oh, no one could steal your spotlight.
Can I get you some more ice?


854
00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:11.881
No, no, no. Stay here and entertain me.
Stop me feeling sorry for myself.


855
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:18.965
Are you always so thoughtful?

856
00:45:20.131 --> 00:45:21.715
Not with everybody.

857
00:45:22.298 --> 00:45:23.298
Lucky me.

858
00:45:25.881 --> 00:45:27.673
There's a storm's coming.

859
00:45:27.756 --> 00:45:30.506
We should probably get you back.
I'm sure you got lots to do.


860
00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:34.090
Not really. Paul's mom
has already done everything.


861
00:45:34.173 --> 00:45:36.923
Where's your mum in this whole equation?

862
00:45:37.006 --> 00:45:40.423
In Des Moines, but she's flying in
for the rehearsal dinner tomorrow.


863
00:45:40.506 --> 00:45:43.381
- I'm sure you'll be happy to see her.
- It'll be great to get her here.


864
00:45:43.465 --> 00:45:46.923
She knows how to handle these situations.
It'll make everything easier.


865
00:45:47.506 --> 00:45:49.631
- Should...
- Give me a hand with that. Yeah.


866
00:45:50.715 --> 00:45:51.548
Just pull.

867
00:46:07.548 --> 00:46:09.048
Holy mother of God!

868
00:46:10.298 --> 00:46:13.423
- This is intense.
- You know what they say about Ireland?


869
00:46:13.506 --> 00:46:16.715
If you don't like the weather,
just wait five minutes.


870
00:46:16.798 --> 00:46:18.256
Mark Twain said that.

871
00:46:24.465 --> 00:46:25.840
That is a really big tree.

872
00:46:25.923 --> 00:46:27.340
Yeah, it is.

873
00:46:27.423 --> 00:46:29.756
And this is the only road out.

874
00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.673
- There has to be another way around it.
- If we had a Hummer.


875
00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:36.465
I'll have to turn around. It's okay.
I know a lovely little pub we can go to.


876
00:46:36.548 --> 00:46:37.590
Wait, really?

877
00:47:00.965 --> 00:47:02.756
- Come on. Come on.
- Ah!


878
00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.173
- Get under.
- Thank you.


879
00:47:04.256 --> 00:47:05.090
Let's go.

880
00:47:06.548 --> 00:47:08.673
It's a good pub, this. 
It'll be worth it.

881
00:47:16.923 --> 00:47:18.548
Wow. This is a fun place.

882
00:47:18.631 --> 00:47:21.006
They do the best
fish and chips in Ireland here.


883
00:47:21.090 --> 00:47:23.816
- I thought you didn't like fish and chips.
- What makes you think that?


884
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:24.840
Well, you said...

885
00:47:25.215 --> 00:47:26.215
Never mind.

886
00:47:26.965 --> 00:47:29.881
James Thomas, you bastard.

887
00:47:30.381 --> 00:47:31.923
O'Callaghan, you swine.

888
00:47:32.548 --> 00:47:34.256
How are you, buddy?

889
00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:35.756
Yeah. What brings you here?

890
00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.756
Well, there's a tree down on the road,
so we're stuck.


891
00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.506
Oh, right, I heard, yeah.

892
00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:43.215
Seamus is gonna see to it
first thing in the morning.


893
00:47:43.298 --> 00:47:45.798
But he's a little cabbaged now.

894
00:47:45.881 --> 00:47:48.881
In that case,
we'll need two rooms for the night.


895
00:47:48.965 --> 00:47:51.715
Whoa, wait, we can't spend the night here.

896
00:47:51.798 --> 00:47:53.881
Well, do you fancy sleeping in the car?

897
00:47:56.715 --> 00:47:58.256
Just give me a second.

898
00:47:59.673 --> 00:48:02.513
<i>This is Paul Kennedy.
I can't get to the phone right now.</i>


899
00:48:02.548 --> 00:48:04.715
- Who's that lovely creature?
- Calm down.


900
00:48:04.798 --> 00:48:08.173
Don't tell me you finally convinced
some young lady you're worth a shake.


901
00:48:08.256 --> 00:48:09.465
Hey, Paul, it's Maddie.

902
00:48:09.548 --> 00:48:13.173
Uh, a tree fell down in the middle
of the road, and so we are stuck here.


903
00:48:13.256 --> 00:48:16.173
Her name is Madeline Kelly,
and I'm photographing her wedding.


904
00:48:16.256 --> 00:48:17.131
Ah.

905
00:48:17.215 --> 00:48:19.090
- Her wedding, huh?
- Now, now.


906
00:48:19.173 --> 00:48:22.631
Looks like I'll have to spend the night.
Call me when you get this.


907
00:48:25.131 --> 00:48:26.298
Okay, I left a message.

908
00:48:26.381 --> 00:48:27.881
Good. Let's eat.

909
00:48:27.965 --> 00:48:30.090
- Ah, take a seat.
- Okay.


910
00:48:32.048 --> 00:48:33.798
How about a couple of stouts?

911
00:48:34.298 --> 00:48:38.215
Oh, can I have a white wine, please?
I don't really drink beer.


912
00:48:38.298 --> 00:48:41.756
Ooh, I wouldn't say that too loud
around these parts.


913
00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:44.256
You'd get locked up for treason.

914
00:48:47.215 --> 00:48:49.131
- He seems great.
- Yeah, he's great.


915
00:48:49.215 --> 00:48:50.715
Tom and I go a long way back.

916
00:48:50.798 --> 00:48:54.048
I've been coming to Ireland
since I was a kid, so it holds a very...


917
00:48:54.548 --> 00:48:56.256
special place in my heart.

918
00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:58.465
Here's our latest. 
Hope you like it.

919
00:48:59.215 --> 00:49:01.215
Is it true that
you don't have a home?

920
00:49:02.715 --> 00:49:06.090
This week it's a rented room
above Scruffy Murphy's.


921
00:49:06.173 --> 00:49:08.215
After, I'll be on the road
traveling the world


922
00:49:08.298 --> 00:49:10.465
with nothing but a camera and a passport.

923
00:49:10.548 --> 00:49:12.631
<i>♪ Different situations ♪</i>

924
00:49:12.715 --> 00:49:15.131
<i>♪ Running through my mind ♪</i>

925
00:49:15.215 --> 00:49:17.590
Doesn't that get lonely after a while?

926
00:49:17.673 --> 00:49:18.756
I mean, it's...

927
00:49:20.131 --> 00:49:22.256
There's a freedom, having no ties.

928
00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:26.006
<i>♪ And I don't
know if I'm crazy ♪</i>

929
00:49:26.548 --> 00:49:30.423
Well, maybe you haven't found that person
to spend the rest of your life with.


930
00:49:32.173 --> 00:49:33.173
Like you did?

931
00:49:33.215 --> 00:49:35.131
<i>♪ I see a
house upon a hill ♪</i>

932
00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:38.590
<i>♪ With our names
written on the deck ♪</i>

933
00:49:39.173 --> 00:49:40.256
Do you play darts?

934
00:49:41.423 --> 00:49:42.256
Not recently.

935
00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.715
Let's play now.

936
00:49:46.548 --> 00:49:47.548
Here we go.

937
00:49:48.965 --> 00:49:52.090
It's all about grip,
stance, and confidence.


938
00:49:53.548 --> 00:49:56.923
- You don't like to talk about yourself.
- What makes you say that?


939
00:49:57.006 --> 00:49:58.590
You keep changing the subject.

940
00:50:01.923 --> 00:50:04.423
You're supposed
to keep your feet on the floor.


941
00:50:05.048 --> 00:50:06.256
You see what I mean?

942
00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:11.173
This time, just try your stance like this.

943
00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:14.631
Only your arm moves.

944
00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:16.840
You're a man of mystery.

945
00:50:16.923 --> 00:50:19.881
If you keep talking,
you won't visualize hitting the target.


946
00:50:23.423 --> 00:50:25.298
- That was sneaky.
- I'm not sneaky.


947
00:50:25.381 --> 00:50:27.173
Maybe it's the luck of the Irish then.

948
00:50:27.256 --> 00:50:28.673
Or maybe it's just you.

949
00:50:30.256 --> 00:50:33.715
- I mean, you're a good coach.
- Well, you're a good student.


950
00:50:37.256 --> 00:50:39.090
I'm getting married in two days.

951
00:50:40.215 --> 00:50:41.048
Right.

952
00:50:44.423 --> 00:50:46.298
- Your drinks.
- Oh.


953
00:50:49.631 --> 00:50:51.673
And your rooms.

954
00:50:51.756 --> 00:50:53.965
- Lovely. Thanks, Tom.
- Enjoy.


955
00:50:55.673 --> 00:50:56.715
Thank you.

956
00:50:57.215 --> 00:50:59.465
- You want to try it?
- Uh, sure.


957
00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.840
Not bad.

958
00:51:10.006 --> 00:51:13.006
- One dance before we call it a night.
- Okay.


959
00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:18.340
I'm sorry. I need to get by here.

960
00:51:18.423 --> 00:51:21.256
It's a family emergency.
I got to go. Please. Please.


961
00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.965
Yeah, you're done. You're done.

962
00:51:23.048 --> 00:51:24.756
Thank you. Bye.

963
00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:28.673
Hi, I've been standing in line
all this time at the wrong counter,


964
00:51:28.756 --> 00:51:30.006
and I've missed my flight.

965
00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.131
So I need you to get me
another one immediately.


966
00:51:32.881 --> 00:51:35.423
Principal Kelly. It's me, Allegra.

967
00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:38.673
- Oh. Yes, hello, Allegra.
- Hi.


968
00:51:38.756 --> 00:51:41.590
Well, I need to get to Ireland.
My daughter's getting married.


969
00:51:41.673 --> 00:51:44.465
- Maddie's getting married?
- Yes. I'm pressed for time.


970
00:51:44.548 --> 00:51:48.131
I missed my flight to Dublin.
So see if you can you find me another one.


971
00:51:48.215 --> 00:51:51.798
Then I need a connection to Knock airport.
That's in West Ireland.


972
00:51:51.881 --> 00:51:54.548
Sure. How did you miss your plane?

973
00:51:55.048 --> 00:51:57.840
A clock malfunction.

974
00:51:58.423 --> 00:52:00.465
You overslept. That's crazy.

975
00:52:01.798 --> 00:52:05.048
There was a power outage,
and my backup phone alarm just...


976
00:52:07.173 --> 00:52:09.423
- What are you doing?
- I'm texting Kimmy.


977
00:52:09.506 --> 00:52:11.798
Remember her from detention?
She's gonna freak out.


978
00:52:11.881 --> 00:52:13.090
- Seriously?
- Yeah.


979
00:52:13.173 --> 00:52:15.715
Somebody help me.

980
00:52:15.798 --> 00:52:17.006
Please, help me!

981
00:52:38.048 --> 00:52:39.048
Let's go.

982
00:53:02.256 --> 00:53:03.673
Hey!

983
00:53:08.548 --> 00:53:10.298
WILD HEN INN

984
00:53:24.465 --> 00:53:26.840
Come on, please start. Please.

985
00:53:26.923 --> 00:53:27.756
Mm-hmm.

986
00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.548
Nope, nothing.

987
00:53:29.631 --> 00:53:32.548
I can't believe this. I'm gonna be late
for my own wedding rehearsal.


988
00:53:32.631 --> 00:53:34.548
Could be water in the carburetor.

989
00:53:35.048 --> 00:53:37.173
- We could try a rolling jump.
- What's that?


990
00:53:37.965 --> 00:53:39.673
You two push. I spring the clutch.

991
00:53:40.381 --> 00:53:42.006
- Sure. Okay.
- Yeah, great.


992
00:53:46.881 --> 00:53:48.465
All right, ready?

993
00:53:48.548 --> 00:53:49.965
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay!


994
00:53:51.298 --> 00:53:52.423
Push!

995
00:53:57.381 --> 00:53:58.840
Whoa!

996
00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:04.590
Success!

997
00:54:05.965 --> 00:54:07.131
Ah, crap.

998
00:54:07.715 --> 00:54:08.715
I'll get a rag.

999
00:54:08.756 --> 00:54:10.881
That'll do. A rag.

1000
00:54:14.965 --> 00:54:17.298
Well, no sign of Madeline.

1001
00:54:17.381 --> 00:54:19.215
First, her mother misses the flight,

1002
00:54:19.298 --> 00:54:21.506
and now here we are
waiting for the daughter.


1003
00:54:21.590 --> 00:54:25.006
- I hope this isn't a family trait.
- You couldn't make it up.


1004
00:54:25.090 --> 00:54:27.050
I'm sure Maddie will be here any minute.

1005
00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:29.256
I mean, those trees
can be a huge challenge,


1006
00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.423
and we don't even know
if they had a chain saw, right, Em?


1007
00:54:32.506 --> 00:54:33.840
Yeah, right.

1008
00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:41.548
I can't believe
you didn't bring a phone charger.


1009
00:54:41.631 --> 00:54:43.423
Neither did you.

1010
00:54:43.506 --> 00:54:45.173
Does this car go any faster?

1011
00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:47.548
- No.
- Great.


1012
00:54:51.756 --> 00:54:54.798
- It's not funny.
- It's pretty funny. It'll be fine. Look.


1013
00:54:54.881 --> 00:54:55.881
Look at that.

1014
00:55:02.006 --> 00:55:04.881
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today

1015
00:55:04.965 --> 00:55:10.090
to celebrate the love
of these two fine, young people who...


1016
00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:13.131
Hold on, I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

1017
00:55:14.631 --> 00:55:16.506
I'm sorry. I'm
-I'm so sorry.

1018
00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:18.756
Close call, Maddie.
You almost lost your place.


1019
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.006
Come here. Come here.

1020
00:55:20.798 --> 00:55:22.215
Oh. Sorry.

1021
00:55:23.048 --> 00:55:25.131
- What happened to you?
- Well...


1022
00:55:25.215 --> 00:55:27.298
Uh, I'm afraid I'm to blame.

1023
00:55:27.381 --> 00:55:29.923
We were coming back
from the Cliffs of Moher.


1024
00:55:30.006 --> 00:55:32.256
What were you doing in that tourist trap?

1025
00:55:32.756 --> 00:55:34.131
How did you get all muddy?

1026
00:55:34.215 --> 00:55:37.756
Well, we're all together now,
and that's what matters.


1027
00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:39.340
Mind if we cut to the chase?

1028
00:55:39.423 --> 00:55:41.903
We have guests are arriving
at the rehearsal dinner in an hour.


1029
00:55:41.965 --> 00:55:45.048
All right then,
let's skip to the good part.


1030
00:55:45.131 --> 00:55:46.965
You may now kiss the bride.

1031
00:55:47.048 --> 00:55:48.465
- Aw!
- Aw!


1032
00:55:58.965 --> 00:55:59.965
James?

1033
00:56:00.673 --> 00:56:01.673
What?

1034
00:56:02.256 --> 00:56:03.340
Who's James?

1035
00:56:06.465 --> 00:56:07.465
That'd be me.

1036
00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:10.215
What happened?

1037
00:56:10.923 --> 00:56:12.215
Well, you fainted.

1038
00:56:15.715 --> 00:56:16.715
It's her.

1039
00:56:18.048 --> 00:56:19.048
It's who?

1040
00:56:19.465 --> 00:56:20.465
Saint Brigid?

1041
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.506
She's the one who made all this happen.

1042
00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:26.173
- Do you think she's been at the whiskey?
- Sean, please.


1043
00:56:26.256 --> 00:56:28.191
- Must be the stress of the wedding.
- Need water?


1044
00:56:28.215 --> 00:56:31.965
No, I'm just, uh...
I just feel a little dizzy, that's all.


1045
00:56:32.965 --> 00:56:35.715
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, of course I'm okay.


1046
00:56:36.506 --> 00:56:37.923
I'm marrying Paul Kennedy.

1047
00:56:38.548 --> 00:56:39.381
That's right.

1048
00:56:40.631 --> 00:56:42.006
Shall we continue?

1049
00:56:42.090 --> 00:56:43.673
Of course, Father. Sorry.

1050
00:56:44.423 --> 00:56:45.673
Where were we?

1051
00:56:52.423 --> 00:56:54.631
Quieten down, everyone.

1052
00:56:54.715 --> 00:56:57.631
My darling husband, 
Sean, has the floor.

1053
00:56:58.965 --> 00:57:00.006
Thank you, darling.

1054
00:57:01.381 --> 00:57:03.548
May your hearts be light and happy.

1055
00:57:03.631 --> 00:57:06.298
May your smiles be big and wide.

1056
00:57:06.381 --> 00:57:10.631
And may your pockets
always have a coin or two inside.


1057
00:57:11.631 --> 00:57:13.923
No worries there, Maddie.
You're marrying a Kennedy.


1058
00:57:15.631 --> 00:57:17.673
- Sláinte!
- Sláinte!


1059
00:57:19.923 --> 00:57:23.381
- You're drinking Guinness now, Maddie?
- I'm acquiring a taste for it.


1060
00:57:23.965 --> 00:57:26.298
All right, now in honor
of the happy couple,


1061
00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:29.756
we're gonna play a game
of "How Well Do You Know Your Fiancé?"


1062
00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.340
Oh!

1063
00:57:32.423 --> 00:57:35.715
Three questions. If you get them right,
you both take a shot.


1064
00:57:35.798 --> 00:57:36.631
Mm-hmm.

1065
00:57:36.715 --> 00:57:39.548
If you get them wrong,
we all have to drink a shot.


1066
00:57:41.298 --> 00:57:44.590
We have to drink no matter what?
Can we play a different game?


1067
00:57:44.673 --> 00:57:48.256
Oh, no, you're not getting out of this.
Kory's making the rules.


1068
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:53.298
All right, first question.
Who is Maddie's favorite author?


1069
00:57:53.381 --> 00:57:55.298
Oh, that's an easy one.

1070
00:57:56.423 --> 00:57:57.423
Paul Kennedy.

1071
00:57:59.465 --> 00:58:01.381
No. Very good. 
Very good, no.

1072
00:58:01.465 --> 00:58:05.381
No, my fiancée likes the classics.
Her favorite author is...


1073
00:58:05.465 --> 00:58:07.048
James Joyce.

1074
00:58:07.131 --> 00:58:08.298
...Charles Dickens.

1075
00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:10.881
That's right.

1076
00:58:10.965 --> 00:58:12.006
Hey!

1077
00:58:15.298 --> 00:58:17.131
One point for the happy couple.

1078
00:58:17.631 --> 00:58:21.673
Question two. What is the song
you first danced to together?


1079
00:58:21.756 --> 00:58:23.215
Ooh.

1080
00:58:24.131 --> 00:58:26.340
- Well, there wasn't one.
- Mm!


1081
00:58:26.423 --> 00:58:30.006
Maddie doesn't know how to dance, do you?

1082
00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.798
Nope.

1083
00:58:33.131 --> 00:58:36.881
We've heard enough from you, brother.
Last question is for you, Maddie.


1084
00:58:38.298 --> 00:58:40.506
Where did Paul propose to you?

1085
00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:43.090
- She knows that answer.
- Tell us anyway.


1086
00:58:43.173 --> 00:58:44.590
- Propose?
- Yeah.


1087
00:58:44.673 --> 00:58:46.798
You know, how'd you get
the ring on your finger?


1088
00:58:46.881 --> 00:58:48.631
Well, go on, Maddie. Tell them.

1089
00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:57.756
Well, it was in this really special place.

1090
00:58:58.340 --> 00:58:59.881
Really special.

1091
00:59:00.381 --> 00:59:02.423
It was so, so special and...

1092
00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:07.798
Right, wasn't it?
It was really beautiful and special.


1093
00:59:07.881 --> 00:59:11.215
It was at O'Toole's in Brooklyn
on my birthday.


1094
00:59:11.298 --> 00:59:12.298
Exactly.

1095
00:59:12.381 --> 00:59:13.590
Ah.

1096
00:59:14.173 --> 00:59:17.215
- It was. It was at O'Toole's in Brooklyn.
- Mm-hmm.


1097
00:59:17.298 --> 00:59:19.006
- On your birthday.
- On my birthday.


1098
00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:20.090
And then...

1099
00:59:20.548 --> 00:59:22.840
Well, and then Maddie looked at me,

1100
00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:27.340
and she said, "What would it take
for you to bring me to Ireland?"


1101
00:59:28.215 --> 00:59:29.215
And I said,

1102
00:59:30.423 --> 00:59:32.715
"We'd have to be getting married."

1103
00:59:34.131 --> 00:59:35.131
And then...

1104
00:59:36.798 --> 00:59:37.798
Then...

1105
00:59:44.631 --> 00:59:46.631
Oh, she's only messing.

1106
00:59:49.506 --> 00:59:52.715
Then you got down on your knee,
and you proposed to me.


1107
00:59:53.215 --> 00:59:54.298
I proposed?

1108
00:59:54.381 --> 00:59:57.506
I mean, yes, of course.
Yes, I proposed. Me.


1109
00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.840
- I. Yes, I proposed.
- You.


1110
00:59:59.923 --> 01:00:03.006
And the rest, as they say, is history.

01:00:20.506 --> 01:00:22.798

- Foot's hurting.


1115
01:00:22.881 --> 01:00:23.881
Come on.

1116
01:00:31.131 --> 01:00:31.965
Excuse me.

1117
01:00:32.048 --> 01:00:35.006
James, I thought
I might take a look at those.


1118
01:00:36.215 --> 01:00:39.006
I think it might be better
if you stay tonight.


1119
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:41.756
I've asked Nevin
to make up the tower suite for you.


1120
01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:42.923
Nevin. Lovely.

1121
01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:44.686
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Fantastic.


1122
01:00:44.756 --> 01:00:48.256
- Thank you for today.
- Of course. Thank you for having me.


1123
01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:49.506
It's been lovely.

1129
01:01:10.465 --> 01:01:12.173
Are you leaving already?

1130
01:01:13.048 --> 01:01:15.631
No, no, no. Just packing up
my stuff for the night.


1131
01:01:16.548 --> 01:01:19.298
Olivia has me staying
in their guest tower.


1132
01:01:19.381 --> 01:01:20.548
Sounds very posh.

1133
01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:25.423
I don't think she trusts me to make it
on time tomorrow after the tree incident.


1134
01:01:25.506 --> 01:01:26.506
- Mm.
- Yeah.


1135
01:01:27.673 --> 01:01:30.881
Thank you for taking me
to see the Cliffs, and for the dance.


1136
01:01:30.965 --> 01:01:33.923
I'd like to think of myself
as a full-service photographer.


1137
01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:47.673
Is it everything you imagined?

1138
01:01:47.756 --> 01:01:48.798
- What?
- This.


1139
01:01:50.631 --> 01:01:51.715
All of this.

1140
01:01:52.756 --> 01:01:56.506
You seemed confused in there,
like you and Paul didn't know each other.


1141
01:01:57.465 --> 01:01:59.673
That's ridiculous.
Of course we know each other.


1142
01:01:59.756 --> 01:02:01.965
- Charles Dickens?
- Anybody can make a mistake.


1143
01:02:02.048 --> 01:02:03.048
Yeah.

1144
01:02:05.131 --> 01:02:06.923
I hope you're not making one too.

1145
01:02:07.923 --> 01:02:09.548
You don't get to say that to me.

1146
01:02:10.256 --> 01:02:13.215
We barely know each other.
We spent a day together.


1147
01:02:13.923 --> 01:02:16.173
I admit it was a beautiful day

1148
01:02:16.256 --> 01:02:18.965
filled with dramatic vistas
and romantic rain,


1149
01:02:19.506 --> 01:02:22.465
but that doesn't give you the right
to question my life choices.


1150
01:02:23.881 --> 01:02:26.006
Tomorrow, I'm marrying Paul Kennedy.

1151
01:02:27.965 --> 01:02:29.298
Because you asked him.

1152
01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:33.965
Wait, so... so what? You don't think
a woman can ask a man to marry her?


1153
01:02:34.048 --> 01:02:35.048
Of course not.

1154
01:02:35.798 --> 01:02:37.923
But if you were my girlfriend,
I wouldn't have waited.


1155
01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:41.090
I'd have asked you first.

1156
01:02:42.965 --> 01:02:45.340
You know what?
Maybe you shouldn't come to the wedding.


1157
01:02:45.423 --> 01:02:46.548
I'll tell Olivia then.

1158
01:02:46.631 --> 01:02:49.631
- Fine. Take the photos.
- Fine. It'll be the last you see of me.


1159
01:02:49.715 --> 01:02:52.798
After this job, I'm off to Bolivia
to photograph an endangered tree lizard.


1160
01:02:52.881 --> 01:02:55.548
- What? When do you leave?
- Sunday.


1161
01:02:56.131 --> 01:02:58.673
Great. Right on time
to keep running from your own life.


1162
01:03:01.048 --> 01:03:02.506
I shouldn't have said that.

1163
01:03:03.715 --> 01:03:04.881
A bit late.

1164
01:03:15.215 --> 01:03:16.048
Mom?

1165
01:03:16.131 --> 01:03:18.756
- I got a flight. We're about to board.
<i>- You did?</i>


1166
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:21.298
- That is great news.
- I'll be there in time for the wedding.


1167
01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.215
But don't pick me up. 
I'll take a taxi.

1168
01:03:23.298 --> 01:03:25.215
Okay. Mom, I'm so happy you're coming.

1169
01:03:25.298 --> 01:03:28.173
- I really need to see you.
<i>- I'll be there soon.</i>


1170
01:03:28.256 --> 01:03:31.131
<i>I'll make sure your wedding to Paul
is absolutely perfect.</i>


1171
01:03:31.215 --> 01:03:32.298
<i>Thank you, Mom.</i>

1172
01:03:32.381 --> 01:03:36.381
<i>Gate change announcement.
Flight 47 to Dublin will now...</i>


1173
01:03:36.465 --> 01:03:39.298
What did they just say?
Hold on one sec, honey.


1174
01:03:39.381 --> 01:03:41.798
Where's everyone going? 
What's happening?

1175
01:03:41.881 --> 01:03:44.548
<i>- I gotta go. Bye.</i>
- Mom? Mom?


1176
01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:49.881
Coming through. 
Coming through.

1177
01:03:51.756 --> 01:03:52.798
Oh.

1178
01:03:52.881 --> 01:03:53.798

01:04:17.006 --> 01:04:19.923
Hi. Uh, looks like you're having fun.

1187
01:04:20.006 --> 01:04:21.715
Emma's a good dancer, huh?

1188
01:04:21.798 --> 01:04:25.090
Yeah. Hey, maybe she can give you
a few pointers for tomorrow.


1189
01:04:25.173 --> 01:04:29.965
Oh, I almost forgot. I wrote our vows.
I emailed them to you.


1190
01:04:30.548 --> 01:04:32.965
Wait, uh, you wrote my wedding vows?

1191
01:04:33.048 --> 01:04:35.006
Maddie, I am a writer.

1192
01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:37.381
But maybe you can
spruce them up a bit, huh?


1193
01:04:38.423 --> 01:04:40.840
Paul, can you come here for a sec?

1194
01:04:40.923 --> 01:04:43.881
Oh. I'm being summoned. You coming?

1195
01:04:43.965 --> 01:04:46.840
You know, I think
I'm gonna head to bed if that's okay.


1196
01:04:46.923 --> 01:04:47.923
I'm pretty beat.

1197
01:04:47.965 --> 01:04:50.548
Okay, well, I'm staying
in the guest room tonight.


1198
01:04:50.631 --> 01:04:52.673
Wouldn't want any bad luck
before the wedding.


1199
01:04:52.756 --> 01:04:54.840
No. Wouldn't want that.

1200
01:04:54.923 --> 01:04:56.340
- Good night.
- Good night.

1204
01:05:50.465 --> 01:05:53.173
HERE YOU GO BABE!
WEDDING VOWS BY PAUL KENNEDY


1205
01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.423
- This was an amazing night.
- It was.


1206
01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:08.715
Yes. I wish it
could have gone on forever.

1207
01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.465
Yeah, me too.

1208
01:06:13.215 --> 01:06:14.923
- Good night.
- Good night.


1209
01:06:46.173 --> 01:06:48.090
Those flowers go in the chapel.

1210
01:06:49.256 --> 01:06:51.006
A perfect morning for a wedding.

1211
01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.340
Did you get a good shot?

1212
01:07:12.548 --> 01:07:13.631
I think so. Yeah.

1213
01:07:14.965 --> 01:07:18.423
Um, haven't you got
a wedding to get ready for?


1214
01:07:19.465 --> 01:07:21.881
Yeah, I'm just taking a moment.

1215
01:07:24.381 --> 01:07:25.631
I'll leave you to it.

1216
01:07:26.881 --> 01:07:30.173
James. I'm really sorry about last night.

1217
01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:34.506
No apologies necessary.

1218
01:07:36.881 --> 01:07:38.215
You've had a lot going on.

1219
01:07:42.006 --> 01:07:44.256
- I read your book.
- You mean Paul's book.


1220
01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:45.756
I know what I said.

1221
01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.506
It's better than his other books.

1222
01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:49.756
A lot better.

1223
01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.340
Wonder how that happened.

1224
01:07:52.215 --> 01:07:54.090
I didn't change all that much.

1225
01:07:55.173 --> 01:07:57.256
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?


1226
01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.840
It's one thing to edit a book,

1227
01:07:58.923 --> 01:08:01.173
but you shouldn't
go on editing your own life.


1228
01:08:03.965 --> 01:08:06.465
I'm not editing my own life, I just...

1229
01:08:06.548 --> 01:08:08.381
I know this might sound strange,

1230
01:08:08.465 --> 01:08:11.423
but I'm not sure
this is supposed to be my life.


1231
01:08:11.506 --> 01:08:14.131
If that's the case,
then now is the time to speak up.


1232
01:08:16.298 --> 01:08:18.465
Is this what you really want, Maddie?

1233
01:08:20.423 --> 01:08:24.215
Is Paul really the person you want
to share the rest of your life with?


1234
01:08:26.756 --> 01:08:28.673
Marrying Paul is my wish come true.

1235
01:08:31.631 --> 01:08:32.631
Okay.

1236
01:08:34.173 --> 01:08:35.965
Then why are you so sad?

1237
01:09:31.673 --> 01:09:32.715
Right this way.

1238
01:09:46.798 --> 01:09:50.965
Your veil is spectacular.
You look amazing.


1239
01:09:51.048 --> 01:09:53.965
Well, this is it.
I can't believe it's all happening.


1240
01:09:54.048 --> 01:09:57.881
Me neither. Can you do me a favor
and see if my mom's arrived?


1241
01:09:57.965 --> 01:10:00.445
- She's not answering her phone.
- Yeah, absolutely. I'm on it.


1242
01:10:00.506 --> 01:10:02.090
Okay, thank you.

1243
01:10:03.715 --> 01:10:04.715
Hi, Father.

1244
01:10:05.673 --> 01:10:06.965
Are you ready, Madeline?

1245
01:10:07.048 --> 01:10:09.131
Uh, I guess so.

1246
01:10:09.631 --> 01:10:11.631
- You guess?
- I'm just...


1247
01:10:13.006 --> 01:10:15.506
Father, I think I've done something wrong.

1248
01:10:16.506 --> 01:10:17.756
What is it, my dear?

1249
01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:21.090
I made a wish to Saint Brigid.

1250
01:10:21.173 --> 01:10:22.048
Oh!

1251
01:10:22.131 --> 01:10:23.131
Is that all?

1252
01:10:23.673 --> 01:10:25.548
You have to be careful with that one.

1253
01:10:25.631 --> 01:10:27.881
She's known to have
a bit of a sense of humor.


1254
01:10:28.465 --> 01:10:30.256
Oh. What does that mean?

1255
01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:34.465
Well, when you ask her for something,
she may not give you what you want,


1256
01:10:35.298 --> 01:10:38.590
but she'll always give you what you need.

1257
01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:42.048
Oh, that's my cue.

1258
01:10:42.131 --> 01:10:45.131
It's all going to work out just fine.
I'll see you out there.


1259
01:10:45.965 --> 01:10:47.215
Oh!

1260
01:10:48.006 --> 01:10:49.840
Oh! It's starting.

1261
01:10:49.923 --> 01:10:52.215
Ah! Are my eyebrows even?

1262
01:10:52.298 --> 01:10:55.298
That makeup artist Olivia hired
has serious 'tude.


1263
01:10:55.381 --> 01:10:57.465
- And I think I pissed her off.
- You look great.


1264
01:10:57.548 --> 01:10:58.590
Mm...

1265
01:11:01.423 --> 01:11:02.756
- I'm sorry, Em.
- Hmm?


1266
01:11:03.465 --> 01:11:04.298
About what?

1267
01:11:04.381 --> 01:11:05.548
You and Paul.

1268
01:11:08.298 --> 01:11:10.381
What are you talking about?

1269
01:11:12.881 --> 01:11:15.215
I know you two
have feelings for each other.


1270
01:11:15.965 --> 01:11:18.048
I saw you on the patio last night.

1271
01:11:19.465 --> 01:11:20.798
Nothing happened.

1272
01:11:20.881 --> 01:11:22.798
I've known you since we were kids, Em.

1273
01:11:23.506 --> 01:11:25.506
It's all right. 
You can tell me.

1274
01:11:26.756 --> 01:11:27.840
Maddie.

1275
01:11:28.673 --> 01:11:30.381
Do you believe in fate?

1276
01:11:32.423 --> 01:11:33.590
Sometimes.

1277
01:11:33.673 --> 01:11:35.590
See, I don't know why,

1278
01:11:36.256 --> 01:11:38.298
but from the moment I met Paul,

1279
01:11:38.798 --> 01:11:42.173
it just... it just felt like
we were supposed to be together.


1280
01:11:43.756 --> 01:11:46.465
In another life, maybe we would have been.

1281
01:11:47.923 --> 01:11:49.173
Just not this one.

1282
01:11:55.381 --> 01:11:57.506
I can't believe
you're taking this so well.


1283
01:11:57.590 --> 01:12:00.381
This is your big
day, and I'm ruining it.

1284
01:12:00.965 --> 01:12:02.965
It's not your fault. Really.

1285
01:12:05.423 --> 01:12:07.173
I'm gonna try to make things right.

1286
01:12:23.173 --> 01:12:24.423
Ah.

1287
01:13:18.298 --> 01:13:19.590
Excuse me.

1288
01:13:19.673 --> 01:13:21.548
- Hi.
- Stop, stop, stop.


1289
01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:24.423
- Hello.
- Is that the dress?


1290
01:13:26.298 --> 01:13:28.090
- What's going on?
- Oh, dear.


1291
01:13:28.673 --> 01:13:31.506
What's she wearing?
Where's the family wedding dress?


1292
01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:41.590
Hi, there.

1293
01:13:42.090 --> 01:13:45.506
Um, for those of you who don't know me,
I'm Maddie.


1294
01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.340
The bride.

1295
01:13:47.881 --> 01:13:49.965
Or at least I was supposed to be.

1296
01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:52.965
Of course, uh, you know Paul.

1297
01:13:53.673 --> 01:13:57.215
He's a really great guy,
and a good writer too.


1298
01:13:58.048 --> 01:13:59.048
Um...

1299
01:13:59.673 --> 01:14:02.715
People often tell me
that I need to speak up for myself.


1300
01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:05.590
So, here it goes.

1301
01:14:08.006 --> 01:14:09.631
I really care about Paul...

1302
01:14:11.006 --> 01:14:12.715
...but I'm not in love with him.

1303
01:14:13.798 --> 01:14:16.590
And I'm pretty sure
he feels the same way about me.


1304
01:14:16.673 --> 01:14:17.756
Maddie.

1305
01:14:18.673 --> 01:14:19.840
I just think

1306
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:23.423
that if you're gonna go through
with something like this,


1307
01:14:23.923 --> 01:14:27.256
like a wedding,
and a marriage, and a life,


1308
01:14:28.006 --> 01:14:32.090
that it should be with someone you love,
not just someone you wish for.


1309
01:14:33.506 --> 01:14:35.840
It should be with someone you find,

1310
01:14:36.423 --> 01:14:39.173
or even someone who finds you.

1311
01:14:44.256 --> 01:14:47.048
I'm sorry. This is unacceptable!

1312
01:14:47.548 --> 01:14:49.798
Paul, how did you let this happen?

1313
01:14:50.298 --> 01:14:51.298
Me?

1314
01:14:52.298 --> 01:14:53.715
It's all his fault.

1315
01:14:54.756 --> 01:14:57.215
- The photographer?
- I saw you with Maddie this morning.


1316
01:14:57.298 --> 01:14:58.548
At the lily pond.

1317
01:14:59.381 --> 01:15:02.048
Wait, what about you and Emma
last night on the patio?


1318
01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:05.590
Oh, that's irrelevant.
This joker is trying to steal my bride.


1319
01:15:05.673 --> 01:15:08.840
At least I'm not stealing Maddie's ideas
and calling them my own.


1320
01:15:10.215 --> 01:15:12.135
- What are you talking about?
- Your latest book.


1321
01:15:12.215 --> 01:15:13.548
Well.

1322
01:15:14.673 --> 01:15:16.131
Wha...?

1323
01:15:16.215 --> 01:15:17.298
I wrote that book.

1324
01:15:17.381 --> 01:15:18.423
Hmm.

1325
01:15:18.506 --> 01:15:20.673
No, you didn't. 
I wrote that book.

1326
01:15:23.465 --> 01:15:24.798
And there you have it.

1327
01:15:24.881 --> 01:15:26.298
Paul, stop.

1328
01:15:26.381 --> 01:15:30.131
No. You're right. You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, everyone.


1329
01:15:30.215 --> 01:15:31.215
Come here!

1330
01:15:32.548 --> 01:15:34.631
No! Stop. Let go of him.

1331
01:15:34.715 --> 01:15:36.423
Maddie, this is not helping.

1332
01:15:38.048 --> 01:15:39.381
Paul, stop it!

1333
01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.465
- My leg.
- Oh!


1334
01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.131
Oh!

1335
01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.173
Sean, don't just stand there!
Do something!


1336
01:15:56.256 --> 01:15:58.631
Come on, son. You got this.

1337
01:15:58.715 --> 01:16:00.298
- Steady does you.
- Who's that?


1338
01:16:02.548 --> 01:16:05.298
- Leave my brother alone!
- Mom? Where are you?


1339
01:16:06.131 --> 01:16:08.715
Don't panic,
but I am in the hospital in Des Moines.


1340
01:16:08.798 --> 01:16:10.840
- What? Are you all right?
<i>- I'm fine.</i>


1341
01:16:10.923 --> 01:16:13.131
I've just got a fracture of the metatarsal

1342
01:16:13.215 --> 01:16:16.256
and a little bump on the head,
but I remember everything now.


1343
01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:20.381
Honey, tell me. The wedding.
Was it everything you ever dreamt of?


1344
01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.673
Kory!

1345
01:16:22.756 --> 01:16:24.173
Not in a million years.

1346
01:16:24.256 --> 01:16:27.506
Why are you not getting him? Help me!
Help me get him.


1347
01:16:28.798 --> 01:16:30.048
Get off my foot! Get off!

1348
01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:34.006
What's wrong with you? What?

1349
01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.965
Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back.

1350
01:16:36.048 --> 01:16:37.048
James!

1351
01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.965
Who are you helping?

1352
01:16:39.048 --> 01:16:41.631
Paul. Are you hurt?

1353
01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:44.798
No, I don't think so.

1354
01:16:46.090 --> 01:16:48.506
I can't believe you called me irrelevant.

1355
01:16:49.881 --> 01:16:50.881
What?

1356
01:16:51.256 --> 01:16:54.548
I didn't mean it like that.
I'm sorry! Come back!


1357
01:16:54.631 --> 01:16:56.256
Oh my God.

1358
01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:58.006
Let's keep him out of this.

1359
01:17:01.090 --> 01:17:02.090
James.

1360
01:17:02.881 --> 01:17:04.506
Wait, James.

1361
01:17:04.590 --> 01:17:06.090
I made a mistake.

1362
01:17:08.256 --> 01:17:12.590
I shouldn't have stayed on this job.
I've become too emotionally involved.


1363
01:17:12.673 --> 01:17:14.965
- You have?
- You heard Paul in there.


1364
01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:19.798
He thinks I'm responsible for all this,
and if I'm being honest, I probably am.


1365
01:17:19.881 --> 01:17:21.090
You're not.

1366
01:17:22.548 --> 01:17:27.131
If I ever made you doubt yourself,
then I am truly sorry.


1367
01:17:27.215 --> 01:17:29.340
- But...
- The best thing I can do is just...


1368
01:17:30.506 --> 01:17:31.673
walk away from you.

1369
01:17:32.256 --> 01:17:34.340
But none of this is your fault.

1370
01:17:35.631 --> 01:17:38.048
I really wish you
all the happiness in the world.


1371
01:17:39.215 --> 01:17:41.006
I can't be happy without you.

1372
01:17:42.006 --> 01:17:44.340
I know this doesn't make sense right now,

1373
01:17:44.423 --> 01:17:46.798
but I believe in my heart
that we're meant to be together.


1374
01:17:49.506 --> 01:17:50.506
Not like this.

1375
01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:54.631
James, stop!

1376
01:18:18.673 --> 01:18:20.506
Goodbye, Maddie.

1377
01:19:10.215 --> 01:19:12.381
Okay, I'm here!

1378
01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:14.340
Oh.

1379
01:19:15.465 --> 01:19:18.340
I know you're here, Saint Brigid.
You can come out now!


1380
01:19:18.423 --> 01:19:21.173
Please! This was all a mistake.

1381
01:19:21.798 --> 01:19:24.215
Paul, the wedding, James.

1382
01:19:24.715 --> 01:19:26.006
Just take it back!

1383
01:19:28.756 --> 01:19:29.881
Saint Brigid!

1384
01:19:29.965 --> 01:19:31.881
There's no need to shout, dear.

1385
01:19:31.965 --> 01:19:33.090
I'm right here.

1386
01:19:34.465 --> 01:19:36.298
I need to unwish my wish.

1387
01:19:36.381 --> 01:19:37.423
Oh.

1388
01:19:38.048 --> 01:19:42.090
I'm afraid that's impossible.
That wish has already been granted.


1389
01:19:42.173 --> 01:19:44.090
But everything has gone horribly wrong.

1390
01:19:44.173 --> 01:19:47.840
Has it? Or has it gone exactly
as it was supposed to?


1391
01:19:47.923 --> 01:19:50.506
No, you're right,
and I've learned my lesson.


1392
01:19:50.590 --> 01:19:52.423

let me unwish my wish!

Oh!

Okay.

1398
01:20:09.715 --> 01:20:11.798
Okay. I can do this.

1399
01:20:14.381 --> 01:20:16.131
I just need a little wind.

1400
01:20:16.881 --> 01:20:19.048
Where's the wind? Okay.

1401
01:20:21.423 --> 01:20:23.798
Okay, just a little breeze.
Give me something.


1402
01:20:23.881 --> 01:20:26.673
I'll take anything you got. Okay.

1407
01:21:19.006 --> 01:21:21.673

- That's a bridesmaid's dress.


1408
01:21:21.756 --> 01:21:24.548
Uh, yes, and it's supposed to be
on the bridesmaid.

01:21:25.256 --> 01:21:27.048

- What ring?


1410
01:21:27.131 --> 01:21:28.506
