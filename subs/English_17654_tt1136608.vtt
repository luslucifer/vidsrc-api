1
00:00:45.146 --> 00:00:50.393
<i>Attention, Mr. Hayes,
your wife is waiting at the station.</i>


2
00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:54.313
<i>Oh, it was after... You know,
after last year's corporate...</i>


3
00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:56.865
...my wife was always
encouraging me, you know?


4
00:00:56.866 --> 00:01:00.486
She said, "No, you did fine
in the corporate." I was a bit nervous.


5
00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:02.738
This little guy. Hello? Sorry.

6
00:01:02.747 --> 00:01:04.081
- That's nice, eh?
- Yeah.


7
00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:05.908
Nice background with the people.

8
00:01:07.085 --> 00:01:10.170
- We are here at... Must I look in there?
- Look into the lens.


9
00:01:10.171 --> 00:01:14.174
We are here at MNU head office,
Department of Alien Affairs.


10
00:01:14.175 --> 00:01:16.426
My name is Wikus van de Merwe.

11
00:01:16.427 --> 00:01:20.089
And behind me you can see
other Alien Affairs workers.


12
00:01:20.098 --> 00:01:23.183
And what we do here
at this department is...


13
00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:27.771
we try to engage with the prawn
on behalf of MNU...


14
00:01:27.772 --> 00:01:30.600
...and on behalf of humans.

15
00:01:32.026 --> 00:01:34.903
<i>To everyone's surprise,
the ship didn't come to a stop...</i>


16
00:01:34.904 --> 00:01:38.949
<i>...over Manhattan or Washington
or Chicago...</i>


17
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.363
<i>...but instead coasted to a halt
directly over the city of Johannesburg.</i>


18
00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:50.711
The doors didn't open for months.
Nobody could get in.


19
00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:54.631
<i>They eventually decided, after much
deliberation, that the best thing to do...</i>


20
00:01:54.632 --> 00:01:57.460
<i>...would be to physically
cut their way in.</i>


21
00:02:01.347 --> 00:02:04.258
We're gonna need a drill down here.

22
00:02:04.642 --> 00:02:09.513
<i>We were on the verge of first contact.</i>

23
00:02:09.522 --> 00:02:11.398
<i>The whole world was watching.</i>

24
00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:12.767
We need some more light.

25
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.897
Expecting, I don't know, music
from heaven and bright shining lights.


26
00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:20.191
Got a lot of moisture in here.

27
00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:22.693
Yeah, just go slowly.

28
00:02:23.202 --> 00:02:25.863
Oh, my God.

29
00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.548
The creatures
were extremely malnourished.


30
00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.127
They were very unhealthy.
They seemed to be aimless.


31
00:02:40.136 --> 00:02:43.305
<i>There was a lot of international
pressure on us at the time.</i>


32
00:02:43.306 --> 00:02:45.348
<i>The world was looking
at Johannesburg...</i>


33
00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.642
<i>...so we had to do the right thing.</i>

34
00:02:47.643 --> 00:02:50.061
<i>The government then established
an aid group...</i>


35
00:02:50.062 --> 00:02:54.141
<i>...that started to ferry the aliens to
a temporary camp that was set up...</i>


36
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.227
<i>...just beneath the ship.</i>

37
00:02:56.778 --> 00:02:59.070
<i>We didn't have a plan.</i>

38
00:02:59.071 --> 00:03:01.023
<i>There was a million of them.</i>

39
00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.409
<i>So, what was
a temporary holding zone...</i>


40
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.245
...soon became fenced,
became militarized.


41
00:03:07.246 --> 00:03:09.740
And before we knew
it, it was a slum.

42
00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:13.577
<i>Well, the truth is nobody really knew
what this place was.</i>


43
00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:17.206
There's a lot of secrets in District 9.

44
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:30.811
At first, a lot of attention was given
to giving the aliens...


45
00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:32.847
...proper status and protection.

46
00:03:33.481 --> 00:03:36.107
They're spending so much money
to keep them here...


47
00:03:36.108 --> 00:03:40.479
...when they could be spending it
on other things. But at least...


48
00:03:40.488 --> 00:03:43.566
<i>At least they're
keeping them separate from us.</i>


49
00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:49.488
I wanna be realistic with everyone.

50
00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:54.326
- The aliens will not be able to go home.
- The aliens are here to stay.


51
00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.213
<i>There were literally thousands
of theories as to why...</i>


52
00:03:58.214 --> 00:04:00.291
<i>...the ship seemed inoperable.</i>

53
00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.052
And what was speculated was that a
command module had detached itself...


54
00:04:04.053 --> 00:04:07.798
...from the main ship and then
somehow mysteriously become lost.


55
00:04:07.807 --> 00:04:11.343
Did it fall by itself
or was it programmed?


56
00:04:12.228 --> 00:04:13.471
I don't know.

57
00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.147
<i>Examination of the old
video footage...</i>


58
00:04:16.148 --> 00:04:20.811
<i>...shows very clearly
that a piece falls from the ship.</i>


59
00:04:25.074 --> 00:04:29.077
We looked everywhere. There's pieces
falling off that vessel for months.


60
00:04:29.078 --> 00:04:31.288
<i>More energy weapon caches found.</i>

61
00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:34.291
<i>The special task force
conducted raids in District 9...</i>


62
00:04:34.292 --> 00:04:37.919
Where there's a weapon, there's crime.
Tensions rose and rose.


63
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.540
People became more and more fed up,
and eventually the rioting started.


64
00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:45.260
<i>Residents in Tembisa rioted
for the third consecutive night...</i>


65
00:04:45.261 --> 00:04:48.464
<i>...in an attempt to remove
all the aliens from their township.</i>


66
00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:57.856
I think they must fix that ship
and they must go.


67
00:04:57.857 --> 00:05:00.518
A virus, a selective virus.

68
00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:02.353
Release it near the aliens.

69
00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:05.648
They must just go. I don't know where,
but they must just go!


70
00:05:05.656 --> 00:05:07.741
If they were from another country,
we might understand...


71
00:05:07.742 --> 00:05:09.868
...but they are not even
from this planet at all.


72
00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:12.571
<i>The government have enforced
a nationwide curfew.</i>


73
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.158
These aliens... Prawns.
...they take my wife away.


74
00:05:16.167 --> 00:05:18.209
The derogatory term "prawn" is used.

75
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.205
Obviously, it implies something
that is a bottom feeder...


76
00:05:21.213 --> 00:05:23.958
<i>...that scavenges the leftovers.</i>

77
00:05:25.176 --> 00:05:28.470
You can't say they don't look
like that. They look like prawns.


78
00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:31.681
<i>Aliens made off
with an undisclosed amount of cash.</i>


79
00:05:31.682 --> 00:05:33.342
<i>One bystander was hurt.</i>

80
00:05:33.351 --> 00:05:36.645
What for an alien might be seen as
something recreational...


81
00:05:36.646 --> 00:05:40.023
...setting fire to a truck,
derailing a train...


82
00:05:40.024 --> 00:05:42.810
...is for us, obviously,
an extremely destructive act.


83
00:05:44.904 --> 00:05:47.072
They can take the sneakers
you are wearing off you.


84
00:05:47.073 --> 00:05:49.991
They check the brand and take them.
They take whatever you have on you.


85
00:05:49.992 --> 00:05:52.619
Your cell phone or anything.

86
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.071
After that, they kill you.

87
00:05:55.373 --> 00:05:58.284
<i>After 20 years, public pressure
forced the government...</i>


88
00:05:58.292 --> 00:06:01.495
<i>...to ship the aliens
out of Johannesburg.</i>


89
00:06:02.171 --> 00:06:05.340
They had had enough, and they
wanted District 9 to be moved...


90
00:06:05.341 --> 00:06:07.793
...and more intensively policed
and controlled.


91
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:12.097
<i>To enforce eviction, the government
turned to Multi-National United.</i>


92
00:06:12.098 --> 00:06:14.140
Welcome all,
and thank you for coming.


93
00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:17.268
Please listen very closely
to this briefing.


94
00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:22.016
Today we start a very complex
and delicate operation.


95
00:06:23.067 --> 00:06:27.070
<i>This is the largest operation that MNU
has ever undertaken...</i>


96
00:06:27.071 --> 00:06:31.358
<i>...and we believe that it is going
to be undertaken successfully.</i>


97
00:06:31.367 --> 00:06:34.528
It is to move 1.8 million prawns...

98
00:06:34.537 --> 00:06:40.284
<i>...from their present home in District 9
to a safer and better location...</i>


99
00:06:40.292 --> 00:06:44.038
...200 kilometers outside
of Johannesburg city.


100
00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:46.881
<i>We've built a nice, new facility
where the prawn can go.</i>


101
00:06:46.882 --> 00:06:49.043
<i>He can be comfortable.
He can stay there.</i>


102
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.097
The people of Johannesburg
and of South Africa are going to live...


103
00:06:54.098 --> 00:06:58.427
...happily and safely, knowing
that that prawn is very far away.


104
00:06:58.436 --> 00:07:04.441
UIO protocol dictates that
we give the aliens 24-hours' notice...


105
00:07:04.442 --> 00:07:06.310
...of our right to evict.

106
00:07:06.318 --> 00:07:09.438
Today, you will serve these notices...

107
00:07:09.447 --> 00:07:12.449
...getting the aliens
to sign the I-27 form.


108
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.904
The legality that MNU is using to evict
the aliens is simply a whitewash.


109
00:07:16.912 --> 00:07:22.368
So I'm going to appoint a field officer
to take direct command.


110
00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.669
Wikus van de Merwe.

111
00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.714
<i>Everybody always said that Wikus
was not a very smart boy...</i>


112
00:07:27.715 --> 00:07:29.708
<i>...but he was a wonderful son.</i>

113
00:07:30.926 --> 00:07:33.170
That was my Wikus. Just...

114
00:07:35.264 --> 00:07:39.517
Yes. Like up on the big stage.
Thank you, Piet. Mr. Smit.


115
00:07:39.518 --> 00:07:44.306
<i>I had to put aside the fact that
my daughter was married to Wikus.</i>


116
00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:48.068
That didn't factor in my decision.

117
00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:52.773
It's almost as big as my wedding day.
You know, not as big.


118
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:55.825
Wikus was always making me things.

119
00:07:55.826 --> 00:07:58.661
He said that way, they just mean
so much more.


120
00:07:58.662 --> 00:08:01.915
He left this papier-mâché ball
on the sofa one day...


121
00:08:01.916 --> 00:08:05.335
...and I didn't see it
and I sat down and I...


122
00:08:05.336 --> 00:08:06.669
I kind of squished it.

123
00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:10.090
They took all his stuff away
for the investigation...


124
00:08:10.091 --> 00:08:12.835
...and I made them bring it all back.

125
00:08:14.053 --> 00:08:16.137
- Congratulations, man.
- Oh, thanks, man.


126
00:08:16.138 --> 00:08:18.723
- Okay, you're gonna go to P-7.
- Wikus. Wikus.


127
00:08:18.724 --> 00:08:22.602
Leslie. How's it going, man?
There's the shake. P-9 for you.


128
00:08:22.603 --> 00:08:24.722
<i>I'm not saying what he did was right.</i>

129
00:08:25.898 --> 00:08:27.690
He took the choices that were given.

130
00:08:27.691 --> 00:08:30.902
This is Trent. Fundiswa, Trent.
Trent, Fundiswa.


131
00:08:30.903 --> 00:08:33.404
- Hi.
- Fundiswa's the guy I've selected...


132
00:08:33.405 --> 00:08:35.824
...to replace me.
If he can make it today, eh?


133
00:08:35.825 --> 00:08:37.617
- I'll make it.
- You think you can?


134
00:08:37.618 --> 00:08:39.862
I just want everyone watching this...

135
00:08:41.038 --> 00:08:42.906
...to learn from what has happened.

136
00:08:44.083 --> 00:08:47.502
You would think things like this
happen to somebody else, not me.


137
00:08:47.503 --> 00:08:49.838
Guys, don't forget to pack
the stun grenades.


138
00:08:49.839 --> 00:08:52.715
Tovi. There's Tovi.
How's it going, man? A long time, eh?


139
00:08:52.716 --> 00:08:54.843
- You got my stuff?
- Hey, big boss.


140
00:08:54.844 --> 00:08:56.594
- How's it going?
- I'm all right.


141
00:08:56.595 --> 00:08:58.964
This is Fundiswa.
He's training with us today.


142
00:08:58.973 --> 00:09:02.217
<i>I think I was...
"Disgusted" would be the word.</i>


143
00:09:03.435 --> 00:09:06.930
There was always a hint of something
not kosher with van de Merwe.


144
00:09:08.107 --> 00:09:11.602
Nobody saw it coming. None of us
had any idea of what he was doing.


145
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:16.156
I think it's a great thing that it's not
the military guys in charge this time.


146
00:09:16.157 --> 00:09:20.027
Not to say Koobus and the cowboys
are not wanted. You're always wanted.


147
00:09:20.703 --> 00:09:22.613
You see now?
These are the cowboys.


148
00:09:23.247 --> 00:09:25.032
- Get out!
- Fire!


149
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.500
They shoot first
and then answer the questions.


150
00:09:27.501 --> 00:09:29.411
You can see...
Hey, sorry, sorry.


151
00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:31.880
That's above the allocated amount
of ammunition.


152
00:09:31.881 --> 00:09:34.090
Your pouches are full,
but you still carry.


153
00:09:34.091 --> 00:09:36.176
Maybe you should speak
to the colonel.


154
00:09:36.177 --> 00:09:38.011
I just think that you should...

155
00:09:38.012 --> 00:09:41.340
FNG over here says that we got
too much ammunition.


156
00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:44.767
All I'm saying, Koobus, is that,
you know, you should find ways...


157
00:09:44.768 --> 00:09:47.596
...of making your guys more efficient,
you know?


158
00:09:47.605 --> 00:09:51.392
Listen to me, you fuck! Get that
fucking camera out of my face.


159
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.684
Fucking <i>doos.</i>

160
00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:56.438
There are rules.
We're all living by rules.


161
00:09:57.615 --> 00:10:01.193
I don't think he can be forgiven.
It was like a betrayal.


162
00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:05.288
I've gotta get going, guys. I think we're
gonna have to out this. We're gonna go.


163
00:10:05.289 --> 00:10:07.157
This is tangled. 
This is tangled.

164
00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:10.293
- Move it, move it.
- Come on, let's go.


165
00:10:10.294 --> 00:10:12.913
- Hurry up. Go on. Go on.
- Go, go, go.


166
00:10:13.547 --> 00:10:17.251
<i>We've got four teams in the air
and three teams on the ground.</i>


167
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.757
Got a visual on the ground crew.
We can take it into position.


168
00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:26.093
Copy that.

169
00:10:30.022 --> 00:10:34.309
These are full. Check your magazines,
people. Come on. Let's go.


170
00:10:34.318 --> 00:10:38.647
The prawn doesn't really understand
the concept of ownership of property.


171
00:10:38.656 --> 00:10:43.034
So we have to come there and say,
"Listen, this is our land."


172
00:10:43.035 --> 00:10:44.945
"Please will you go?"

173
00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:51.417
It's difficult to put the vest on
by yourself.


174
00:10:51.418 --> 00:10:54.754
- Thomas, can you help me?
- They told me I was going to get a vest.


175
00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:58.208
Just look... Thomas, just look
on the side if there's a vest there.


176
00:10:58.217 --> 00:11:01.761
- I'm concerned about my family.
- Look, don't worry. It'll be fine.


177
00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:04.180
<i>Rights groups have demanded
that mercenaries...</i>


178
00:11:04.181 --> 00:11:07.718
<i>...should comply
with all UIO regulations in District 9.</i>


179
00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:11.972
<i>We're coming to you from
the entrance of District 9...</i>


180
00:11:12.189 --> 00:11:15.858
<i>...as today Multi-National United
sets out to relocate...</i>


181
00:11:15.859 --> 00:11:20.355
<i>...approximately 1. 8 million
alien residents from their homes.</i>


182
00:11:20.364 --> 00:11:23.700
<i>Human-rights groups are keeping
a watchful eye, as many suspect...</i>


183
00:11:23.701 --> 00:11:25.152
<i>...abuses might occur.</i>

184
00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:45.638
<i>We're seeing heavily armed
private security forces...</i>


185
00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:51.553
<i>...being deployed into District 9,
backed up by significant air support.</i>


186
00:12:00.988 --> 00:12:04.191
We go shack to shack
and get them to sign the form.


187
00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:07.319
First one, E
-X-triple-seven.

188
00:12:07.328 --> 00:12:10.906
<i>We're seeing the convoy stop
and the operation is about to begin.</i>


189
00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:16.586
<i>- Arriving at destination.</i>
- Just stay focused.


190
00:12:16.587 --> 00:12:18.914
- You ready, Thomas?
- Yeah.


191
00:12:19.715 --> 00:12:21.758
- Okay. Yeah, that's it.
- Here we go.


192
00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:23.468
- Ready, boss?
- That's the signal.


193
00:12:23.469 --> 00:12:25.845
<i>Doors will now open.
Please mind the step.</i>


194
00:12:25.846 --> 00:12:29.174
- You stay behind us. Good luck, boy.
- Sure, sure.


195
00:12:29.183 --> 00:12:32.553
- No, no. Don't split up.
- Shit!


196
00:12:34.646 --> 00:12:36.473
- Thomas.
- We've got the bastard.


197
00:12:36.482 --> 00:12:39.650
Stay, stay, stay. Stay low.
Where is he going? What is he...?


198
00:12:39.651 --> 00:12:41.061
Okay, Thomas, move away.

199
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:43.196
<i>It's clear that security is very high...</i>

200
00:12:43.197 --> 00:12:46.066
<i>...and it's only the beginning
of a total clampdown.</i>


201
00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:52.372
We are here to assist you.

202
00:12:52.373 --> 00:12:55.041
Move out. Let's go.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!


203
00:12:55.042 --> 00:12:57.327
Let's go. Move out. Let's go!

204
00:12:57.628 --> 00:12:58.878
This is MNU agents.

205
00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:02.124
- Open the door, please.
- Open up, open up. MNU are here.


206
00:13:02.591 --> 00:13:04.759
- MNU.
- Always hold your badge up.


207
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.012
Hello. Hello. Hello.

208
00:13:08.013 --> 00:13:10.890
Okay. This is Wikus van de Merwe
from MNU.


209
00:13:10.891 --> 00:13:13.267
We are here to serve you
an eviction notice.


210
00:13:13.268 --> 00:13:14.644
You just put your scrawl there.

211
00:13:14.645 --> 00:13:16.263
Fuck off!

212
00:13:16.355 --> 00:13:18.682
Okay, all right. 
Thomas, hold it.

213
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.608
We've got the scrawl. 
As he hit it...

214
00:13:20.609 --> 00:13:24.187
That's what I was saying,
it counts as a scrawl.


215
00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:29.784
First time you come in, there'll always
be a little bit of tension between us...


216
00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:32.495
Hey! Hey, food sack,
you can't eat that, man.


217
00:13:32.496 --> 00:13:35.248
The prawn likes to eat the rubber.
Like a marshmallow.


218
00:13:35.249 --> 00:13:38.126
No, no, no! Don't prod him.
Don't prod him like that.


219
00:13:38.127 --> 00:13:40.329
Don't prod him.

220
00:13:41.171 --> 00:13:42.422
Fuck.

221
00:13:42.423 --> 00:13:44.298
You see that. Breaking the rules.

222
00:13:44.299 --> 00:13:46.001
No, stay calm.

223
00:13:47.886 --> 00:13:51.305
Okay, this is gonna be problems.
All the prawns are coming out.


224
00:13:51.306 --> 00:13:54.725
They wanna see what's going on.
No, hey. Stop it! Stop it!


225
00:13:54.726 --> 00:13:55.935
Horace, bring my <i>goed.</i>

226
00:13:55.936 --> 00:13:58.187
See? Everybody's gathering now.
Don't shoot.


227
00:13:58.188 --> 00:14:01.357
- You're gonna turn it into a war zone.
- What is that? Tear gas?


228
00:14:01.358 --> 00:14:03.609
- Is that tear gas?
- No, it's cat food.


229
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.146
It's cat food. 
I just distract them.

230
00:14:06.155 --> 00:14:09.407
Yeah, yeah. He got a bit close,
he was prodding a prawn and he...


231
00:14:09.408 --> 00:14:11.325
He's lost his arm.

232
00:14:11.326 --> 00:14:14.404
So we need a team down here
straightaway, please, man.


233
00:14:14.413 --> 00:14:18.700
No, it's not my house.
I don't live here.


234
00:14:18.709 --> 00:14:21.377
That's a pity, because you know this...

235
00:14:21.378 --> 00:14:24.039
Hell, this is a nice cat food,
you know?


236
00:14:24.047 --> 00:14:27.008
But it's not your house,
so we'll give it to someone else.


237
00:14:27.009 --> 00:14:28.217
Yes! It is my house!

238
00:14:28.218 --> 00:14:30.636
We need you to sign there.
Okay, there it is.


239
00:14:30.637 --> 00:14:34.849
Now you can take that. Okay, all right.
Thomas. Thomas, wait. Take it easy.


240
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.053
<i>The creatures became incredibly
obsessed with cat food.</i>


241
00:14:38.061 --> 00:14:41.856
Something about that. It was like
catnip for cats, only a lot more intense.


242
00:14:41.857 --> 00:14:44.351
Get down on the ground or I'll shoot.

243
00:14:44.359 --> 00:14:46.937
Come on. Come on.
That's it. Come on.


244
00:14:46.945 --> 00:14:48.522
MNU are your friends.

245
00:14:49.698 --> 00:14:52.450
Hello? MNU. We are here
to serve eviction notices.


246
00:14:52.451 --> 00:14:54.577
What is eviction?

247
00:14:54.578 --> 00:14:55.828
Hold it, boys.

248
00:14:55.829 --> 00:15:00.617
<i>What we have stranded on Earth in
this colony, is basically the workers.</i>


249
00:15:01.835 --> 00:15:05.004
Don't think for themselves,
take commands, have no initiative.


250
00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:08.625
They've lost all of their leadership
through, we presume, illness.


251
00:15:09.676 --> 00:15:12.254
- We are here for you.
- Keep your fucking hands up.


252
00:15:13.931 --> 00:15:17.092
...holding stable in
the Nigerian compound area.


253
00:15:26.902 --> 00:15:29.271
<i>Where there's a slum, there's crime...</i>

254
00:15:29.696 --> 00:15:31.857
<i>...and District 9 was no exception.</i>

255
00:15:31.865 --> 00:15:34.283
The Nigerians had
various scams going.


256
00:15:34.284 --> 00:15:36.695
One of them was the cat-food scam...

257
00:15:36.703 --> 00:15:40.490
<i>...where they sold cat food
to the aliens for exorbitant prices.</i>


258
00:15:40.499 --> 00:15:42.617
You put the money here first.

259
00:15:42.626 --> 00:15:45.328
You don't get anything until you pay.

260
00:15:47.756 --> 00:15:50.500
What are you trying to do?
I'll chop your balls off.


261
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:53.420
<i>Not to mention
interspecies prostitution.</i>


262
00:15:53.428 --> 00:15:56.298
<i>And they also dealt
in alien weaponry.</i>


263
00:15:56.306 --> 00:15:58.975
You have a car hijacking,
there's a chop shop there.


264
00:15:58.976 --> 00:16:01.219
See that?
That's somebody's car in there.


265
00:16:01.228 --> 00:16:05.599
The Nigerians in District 9 are headed
by a man called Obesandjo.


266
00:16:05.607 --> 00:16:09.561
<i>He's a very powerful
underground figure in Johannesburg.</i>


267
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:12.488
Don't play with these boys.
He'll cut you in four pieces.


268
00:16:12.489 --> 00:16:14.991
- He will put you on each side of...
- Boss. Boss.


269
00:16:14.992 --> 00:16:18.987
That's the boss there. Okay,
no problems. No. Keep walking.


270
00:16:18.996 --> 00:16:23.366
Don't look at him. That's gonna cause
problems. Trent, don't film here now.


271
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:25.744
Double up, baby, double up.

272
00:16:26.086 --> 00:16:29.664
- All right, next, 766. All right.
- Now, this is the one.


273
00:16:30.257 --> 00:16:33.593
- MNU agents. Open the door, please.
- Hey, hey.


274
00:16:33.594 --> 00:16:35.378
- What?
- Jesus.


275
00:16:35.387 --> 00:16:37.839
- Thomas. Check around the side.
- What is it?


276
00:16:37.848 --> 00:16:40.683
Check around the side there.
That's a...


277
00:16:40.684 --> 00:16:44.520
Control, it's Wikus van de Merwe.
I need a population-control team...


278
00:16:44.521 --> 00:16:48.934
...at JV-766, Zone 4 immediately,
please. Check that side, Thomas.


279
00:16:48.942 --> 00:16:52.187
- There's 40 to 50 eggs in here.
- Is this normal?


280
00:16:52.195 --> 00:16:54.447
- This is an amazing find.
- They're all gone.


281
00:16:54.448 --> 00:16:56.782
I can just show you a little bit
how it works.


282
00:16:56.783 --> 00:16:59.744
Basically, a cow is hung
from the ceiling, you can see.


283
00:16:59.745 --> 00:17:04.123
Very little of it left, of course, because
all these pipes supply the nutrition...


284
00:17:04.124 --> 00:17:06.660
...to the little prawn eggs.

285
00:17:06.668 --> 00:17:08.919
- You can do one, if you want.
- No, I'm fine.


286
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.632
You want to see? There you go. Okay.
No more nutrition to the guy.


287
00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:15.843
- And then, finally, we take out that.
- Oh, God.


288
00:17:15.844 --> 00:17:19.089
The little guy has gone
to a nice little sleep now.


289
00:17:19.348 --> 00:17:22.892
Just pop him out. There we go.
And pop him out here.


290
00:17:22.893 --> 00:17:26.513
You can take that. Keep it
as a souvenir for your first abortion.


291
00:17:26.521 --> 00:17:28.814
- You can feel like you did one.
- Yes, boss.


292
00:17:28.815 --> 00:17:30.517
Where's the team now?

293
00:17:31.318 --> 00:17:34.111
Okay, here he comes, guys.

294
00:17:34.112 --> 00:17:35.605
This is The Snake.

295
00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:39.784
To go in and abort each egg one
at a time would take a very long time.


296
00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:42.112
So this makes a lot of sense.

297
00:17:42.663 --> 00:17:46.290
Do you hear that? That's a popping
sound that you're hearing.


298
00:17:46.291 --> 00:17:51.212
It's almost like a popcorn.
What the egg does is, it pops up.


299
00:17:51.213 --> 00:17:54.457
The little guy, what's left of him,
pops out there.


300
00:17:54.466 --> 00:17:57.510
So that's the sound
that you are hearing with the popping.


301
00:17:57.511 --> 00:18:01.256
You don't need that, man. Only sissies
wear that. You don't need that.


302
00:18:01.264 --> 00:18:05.093
- You've been drinking a little bit, eh?
- Watch the suit, man.


303
00:18:05.102 --> 00:18:07.853
What are you doing
with these television sets here?


304
00:18:07.854 --> 00:18:09.264
What's this?

305
00:18:09.398 --> 00:18:11.691
Hey. Smile for the cameras there, eh?

306
00:18:11.692 --> 00:18:14.311
- That's a first-day find.
- That's a big find.


307
00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:17.279
You see this? Look at this.
Trent. Trent, look at this.


308
00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.989
There's weapons all over here.

309
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.693
TK-57572.

310
00:18:21.702 --> 00:18:28.450
Some of the guns are small.
But if it shoot you, it make a big mess.


311
00:18:32.796 --> 00:18:36.541
MNU is trying to move the aliens
for humanitarian reasons...


312
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:40.837
<i>...but the real focus, just as it has been
right from the beginning, is weapons.</i>


313
00:18:41.263 --> 00:18:46.009
<i>MNU is the second-largest weapons
manufacturer in the world.</i>


314
00:18:46.017 --> 00:18:48.978
We assumed that we'd be able
to pick up the alien gun...


315
00:18:48.979 --> 00:18:51.681
...and be able to shoot it.
It didn't work like that.


316
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.693
<i>As we discovered, their technology is
engineered in a biological manner...</i>


317
00:18:55.694 --> 00:18:57.979
<i>...and interacts exclusively
with their DNA.</i>


318
00:18:57.988 --> 00:19:01.066
<i>So it just doesn't work with humans.
It's as simple as that.</i>


319
00:19:02.909 --> 00:19:05.911
This is basically a guy
and there's three humans here.


320
00:19:05.912 --> 00:19:08.247
Basically, trying to make a warning,
you know?


321
00:19:08.248 --> 00:19:11.993
He's saying, "I killed three humans.
Watch out for me."


322
00:19:12.002 --> 00:19:15.463
Hey, don't urinate on your own bloody...
Okay. Back up. Back up.


323
00:19:15.464 --> 00:19:17.791
Back up, back up, back up.
Guys. Thomas.


324
00:19:17.799 --> 00:19:22.253
Control, this is Wikus requesting
First Battalion air support, please.


325
00:19:23.388 --> 00:19:27.099
You want to talk to them or you want
to talk to me? Yeah, you can talk...


326
00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.426
No, not them!

327
00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:32.013
No.

328
00:19:34.983 --> 00:19:39.646
Okay, guys, thanks very much.
Yeah, no, he had a spade.


329
00:19:55.962 --> 00:19:58.422
Look! I find some!

330
00:19:58.423 --> 00:20:00.007
I tell you before...

331
00:20:00.008 --> 00:20:02.134
...this is human technology...

332
00:20:02.135 --> 00:20:03.677
...it is useless.

333
00:20:03.678 --> 00:20:06.305
Only our technology
contains the fluid.


334
00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:08.216
That is not our technology?

335
00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.051
No, it's junk.

336
00:20:10.644 --> 00:20:12.345
Keep looking.

337
00:20:14.898 --> 00:20:17.225
I find something.

338
00:20:17.692 --> 00:20:21.521
Yes. This is what we need.

339
00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:24.190
Good, little one.

340
00:20:28.537 --> 00:20:29.779
Get down.

341
00:20:39.631 --> 00:20:41.791
Careful. Wait.

342
00:20:42.551 --> 00:20:43.960
There.

343
00:20:44.928 --> 00:20:47.471
Why must it take so long?

344
00:20:47.472 --> 00:20:50.592
Because it is very difficult...

345
00:20:51.601 --> 00:20:54.429
...so much can go wrong.

346
00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:08.993
Twenty years of work.

347
00:21:08.994 --> 00:21:10.828
Our plan is ready now?

348
00:21:10.829 --> 00:21:13.198
Quiet. Listen.

349
00:21:14.499 --> 00:21:16.785
They are coming.

350
00:21:16.793 --> 00:21:21.164
To Control, van de Merwe unit.
This is Yankee-Foxtrot-5-3-O.


351
00:21:21.172 --> 00:21:24.300
This is a dangerous area, you know.

352
00:21:24.301 --> 00:21:26.169
You must hide this...

353
00:21:26.511 --> 00:21:28.713
...they must not find it.

354
00:21:28.722 --> 00:21:31.299
Answer the door and be polite.

355
00:21:31.558 --> 00:21:33.843
No! You take it.

356
00:21:34.352 --> 00:21:38.814
Okay, now, you see, this is a problem.
This is a gang sign. You see this?


357
00:21:38.815 --> 00:21:41.817
So again, looks like we have a...
Thomas, look sharp, eh?


358
00:21:41.818 --> 00:21:43.736
Looks like we have
more gang members.


359
00:21:43.737 --> 00:21:46.447
Fundiswa, you just stay back.
You stay behind Thomas.


360
00:21:46.448 --> 00:21:47.865
This place is swarming with MNU.

361
00:21:47.866 --> 00:21:49.074
Open up!

362
00:21:49.075 --> 00:21:50.360
I will be searched.

363
00:21:50.452 --> 00:21:52.119
I must get back to my son.

364
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.155
Don't make them angry. Be polite!

365
00:21:54.831 --> 00:21:58.542
MNU agents. Open the door, please.
Hello.


366
00:21:58.543 --> 00:21:59.793
Nobody is here.

367
00:21:59.794 --> 00:22:02.671
We would like you to please sign...
That's unacceptable.


368
00:22:02.672 --> 00:22:03.923
Move out! Move out!

369
00:22:03.924 --> 00:22:06.926
- That is totally unacceptable!
- Get out, you stupid prawn.


370
00:22:06.927 --> 00:22:09.678
- That's bloody rude. Get outside.
- Come on. Move!


371
00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:11.388
- Move! Move!
- Get outside.


372
00:22:11.389 --> 00:22:13.223
We tried to talk nicely with you.

373
00:22:13.224 --> 00:22:17.645
I tried to talk nicely with him, I did.
Get him out to the front there, Thomas.


374
00:22:17.646 --> 00:22:19.563
- Keep moving.
- Cheeky bastard.


375
00:22:19.564 --> 00:22:21.307
You got something in your house?

376
00:22:21.316 --> 00:22:23.233
- All the way, Thomas.
- On your knees.


377
00:22:23.234 --> 00:22:26.487
- I'm gonna have a look.
- Just stay there. Right there.


378
00:22:26.488 --> 00:22:29.114
Sir, we have to serve you
an eviction notice.


379
00:22:29.115 --> 00:22:30.532
Do you understand that?

380
00:22:30.533 --> 00:22:31.533
No.

381
00:22:31.534 --> 00:22:34.662
This is a classic kind of
gangster shack. I can tell you...


382
00:22:34.663 --> 00:22:36.288
...we gonna find weapons here.

383
00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:39.041
Trent, watch your head.
Don't hit the cow's head.


384
00:22:39.042 --> 00:22:41.251
Just checking for panels.

385
00:22:41.252 --> 00:22:43.997
You hear that?
Yeah, it's hollow there.


386
00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:48.251
See? Look at that. Look at that.

387
00:22:48.885 --> 00:22:50.844
I haven't seen this type of setup.

388
00:22:50.845 --> 00:22:54.757
It's almost like
a chemistry type of a set.


389
00:22:55.433 --> 00:22:57.635
There's gonna be something.

390
00:22:59.479 --> 00:23:01.306
What is this <i>kak?</i>

391
00:23:03.233 --> 00:23:05.059
What is this?

392
00:23:09.364 --> 00:23:12.199
I don't know. This has got
the markings there of...


393
00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.569
So it's definitely alien.

394
00:23:14.953 --> 00:23:18.531
But it's not a weapon.

395
00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.368
But I don't trust it.
You know, I don't trust anything that...


396
00:23:22.585 --> 00:23:24.461
Are you all right?

397
00:23:24.462 --> 00:23:28.041
- Wikus, are you all right?
- Cut it. Turn it off.


398
00:23:32.012 --> 00:23:34.380
Just switch it off. Turn it off.
Turn it off.


399
00:23:34.889 --> 00:23:37.975
You gonna just... You gonna
cut that part, Trent, out of this?


400
00:23:37.976 --> 00:23:39.518
- Yeah.
- Where it sprays me.


401
00:23:39.519 --> 00:23:40.728
We'll cut that.

402
00:23:40.729 --> 00:23:44.565
We just found
a dangerous object here.


403
00:23:44.566 --> 00:23:49.528
It has a fluid in it that I suspect might
leak onto people or cause damage.


404
00:23:49.529 --> 00:23:53.191
So we just check that in and we
take that down nicely to the lab.


405
00:23:53.199 --> 00:23:55.276
It's not a weapon, but it's dangerous.

406
00:23:55.285 --> 00:23:57.119
He's got weapons somewhere here.

407
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.365
My sense is telling me that.
Let's check the other side here.


408
00:24:00.373 --> 00:24:01.665
- Thomas.
- Yes, sir?


409
00:24:01.666 --> 00:24:03.792
- Thomas, keep the gun on him.
- I got him.


410
00:24:03.793 --> 00:24:06.621
Keep the gun on him, Thomas.
There's weapons here.


411
00:24:08.048 --> 00:24:11.542
This is Christmas.
This is Christmas, my friends.


412
00:24:11.551 --> 00:24:13.969
This is the biggest find
that I've ever seen.


413
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.388
Control, come in.
This is Wikus van de Mervve...


414
00:24:16.389 --> 00:24:18.766
...requesting First Reaction Battalion...

415
00:24:18.767 --> 00:24:22.136
<i>...at Foxtrot
-Yankee-5-3-0.</i>

416
00:24:23.354 --> 00:24:26.307
<i>- I'll send them out to you now, sir.</i>
- Stand by, guys.


417
00:24:27.317 --> 00:24:30.861
This I've never seen. Have you seen
this? Amazing. Look at this gun.


418
00:24:30.862 --> 00:24:33.280
- Fuck, man.
- What gun is this?


419
00:24:33.281 --> 00:24:35.783
- This is absolutely amazing.
- Just hold it still.


420
00:24:35.784 --> 00:24:38.327
- What are you doing?
- I wanna show this to Thomas.


421
00:24:38.328 --> 00:24:41.163
- You said we can't handle them.
- I'm just gonna show it.


422
00:24:41.164 --> 00:24:44.826
I'm not gonna use it.
It doesn't even work with humans.


423
00:24:44.918 --> 00:24:49.338
- Thomas, look at this gun.
- Yeah. That's a big one, man.


424
00:24:49.339 --> 00:24:50.339
That's not mine.

425
00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:51.340
You're a dealer?

426
00:24:51.341 --> 00:24:52.500
No.

427
00:24:54.385 --> 00:24:56.428
You hear this?
You see what's happening?


428
00:24:56.429 --> 00:24:59.098
First Battalion, my friend,
you know what that means?


429
00:24:59.099 --> 00:25:01.850
That means your days
of flaunting the law are over.


430
00:25:01.851 --> 00:25:05.354
Have a look there. You see that?
What's that? That's a hiding for you.


431
00:25:05.355 --> 00:25:06.939
That's a hiding.

432
00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.691
- Hey. Hey.
- Stop that!


433
00:25:09.692 --> 00:25:11.769
- Stand back!
- Hey.


434
00:25:18.535 --> 00:25:20.403
Wikus!

435
00:25:34.384 --> 00:25:35.634
Come here.

436
00:25:35.635 --> 00:25:38.296
- Wikus, are you all right?
- Come here.


437
00:25:38.304 --> 00:25:41.557
Where do you think you're going?
Hey. Come on.


438
00:25:41.558 --> 00:25:42.891
- Are you okay?
- Fuck off!


439
00:25:42.892 --> 00:25:45.477
You don't run away from a chopper.
Where are you going?


440
00:25:45.478 --> 00:25:47.138
No. No.

441
00:25:49.983 --> 00:25:52.518
Skeet off, brother. Skeet off.

442
00:25:57.031 --> 00:25:58.775
Koobus to base, come in.

443
00:26:00.118 --> 00:26:01.952
I've got two people down.

444
00:26:01.953 --> 00:26:04.530
MNU guard, MNU agent.

445
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.369
It's Foxtrot
-Yankee-5-3-0, copy?

446
00:26:09.377 --> 00:26:11.378
And we need a medevac ASAP.

447
00:26:11.379 --> 00:26:15.048
No, that's fine, Koobus.
I don't need the medevac.


448
00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:18.719
- Wikus, you burned your arm.
- I'll just treat it here, Koobus.


449
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:21.381
It's not serious. 
I'll treat it here.

450
00:26:21.598 --> 00:26:23.849
I think you must go to a doctor,
a hospital.


451
00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:25.225
- No.
- Get it checked out.


452
00:26:25.226 --> 00:26:30.306
I'll just have it treated by the medics.
Just help me... Help me up quick.


453
00:26:30.899 --> 00:26:33.025
Did you see how fast
that one was, Trent?


454
00:26:33.026 --> 00:26:34.484
Yeah, he was fast.

455
00:26:34.485 --> 00:26:36.896
Hell, this guy was fast,
I promise you.


456
00:26:44.787 --> 00:26:46.622
Look, I fix it...

457
00:26:46.623 --> 00:26:47.998
...I make it work.

458
00:26:47.999 --> 00:26:50.618
I told you not to touch that.

459
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.253
What is wrong?

460
00:26:53.254 --> 00:26:56.707
Nothing.
Go outside and watch for humans.


461
00:26:57.717 --> 00:26:59.794
Where is your friend?

462
00:27:00.553 --> 00:27:02.630
He's gone.

463
00:27:14.692 --> 00:27:16.944
- Are you okay?
- Just a bit hot. Are you hot?


464
00:27:16.945 --> 00:27:18.445
- Are you hot, Trent?
- Yeah.


465
00:27:18.446 --> 00:27:21.865
Yeah. If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the kitchen.


466
00:27:21.866 --> 00:27:23.943
That's what I... 
That's what I say.

467
00:27:23.952 --> 00:27:26.411
- They are too dangerous. I understand.
- You see.


468
00:27:26.412 --> 00:27:29.414
Another kid. There's just kids
everywhere. Kids everywhere.


469
00:27:29.415 --> 00:27:32.251
This is what I mean.
This is why we get rid of them.


470
00:27:32.252 --> 00:27:34.336
- The little ones.
- That's why we abort.


471
00:27:34.337 --> 00:27:37.381
- Should I shoot the little bastard?
- You can't shoot it now.


472
00:27:37.382 --> 00:27:38.715
It's illegal to do that.

473
00:27:38.716 --> 00:27:40.842
- MNU agent, come out.
- Hello.


474
00:27:40.843 --> 00:27:43.637
Hello, little guy. MNU.
Here's a sweetie for you, okay.


475
00:27:43.638 --> 00:27:46.014
There you go.
Eat your sweetie.


476
00:27:46.015 --> 00:27:48.517
Yeah, he's gonna eat his sweetie.

477
00:27:48.518 --> 00:27:50.978
Works like a charm every time,
you know.


478
00:27:50.979 --> 00:27:52.813
- Hey. Hey, come on! Hey!
- Fuck, man.


479
00:27:52.814 --> 00:27:56.525
You almost poked my eye out
with a fucking lollipop.


480
00:27:56.526 --> 00:27:58.777
- I tried to be fucking nice to you!
- Hey.


481
00:27:58.778 --> 00:28:01.571
Fuck. Is this
your fucking little runt here?


482
00:28:01.572 --> 00:28:03.156
Inside, go!

483
00:28:03.157 --> 00:28:04.741
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

484
00:28:04.742 --> 00:28:07.236
You teach him some manners.
Thomas, get him out.


485
00:28:07.245 --> 00:28:11.206
Come. Get down!
Had enough of you stupid things.


486
00:28:11.207 --> 00:28:13.493
What do you want?

487
00:28:14.252 --> 00:28:15.502
We're from MNU.

488
00:28:15.503 --> 00:28:16.712
I know.

489
00:28:16.713 --> 00:28:19.673
We require your scrawl
on this eviction notification.


490
00:28:19.674 --> 00:28:21.633
Why am I being evicted?

491
00:28:21.634 --> 00:28:23.503
Yes, it's eviction notice.

492
00:28:23.511 --> 00:28:25.971
Put your scrawl on the bottom.
There's your name?


493
00:28:25.972 --> 00:28:27.180
Yes?

494
00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:29.516
Christopher Johnson.
Put your name at the bottom.


495
00:28:29.517 --> 00:28:31.727
It says you must give me

496
00:28:31.728 --> 00:28:34.646
You're going to another place.
A city built for prawns.


497
00:28:34.647 --> 00:28:37.357
And we're not even
going to charge you. Okay?


498
00:28:37.358 --> 00:28:38.567
This isn't legal.

499
00:28:38.568 --> 00:28:39.776
Sign the fucking paper.

500
00:28:39.777 --> 00:28:40.986
No.

501
00:28:40.987 --> 00:28:43.864
You don't have a choice.
You have to sign the document.


502
00:28:43.865 --> 00:28:47.117
This guy's obviously...
He's a little sharper.


503
00:28:47.118 --> 00:28:49.612
You know? So we're gonna
have to try something.


504
00:28:49.912 --> 00:28:51.121
Hello.

505
00:28:51.122 --> 00:28:55.459
Okay, seems like we didn't understand
each other there properly, eh?


506
00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:59.296
Okay. So you've got a little one, eh?
Do you have a license for that?


507
00:28:59.297 --> 00:29:00.505
Yes.

508
00:29:00.506 --> 00:29:04.760
You see this litter out here? This is
dangerous conditions for your child.


509
00:29:04.761 --> 00:29:08.889
Article 75 says that because your child
is living in dangerous conditions...


510
00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:12.517
...I'm gonna take him to Child Services.
I'll have a chat with your son.


511
00:29:12.518 --> 00:29:14.353
You keep away from my child!

512
00:29:14.354 --> 00:29:17.064
Don't... Don't point
your fucking tentacles at me.


513
00:29:17.065 --> 00:29:19.191
Don't point
your fucking tentacles at me.


514
00:29:19.192 --> 00:29:21.902
You want to stay,
your boy is coming down with me...


515
00:29:21.903 --> 00:29:26.156
to Child Services. He's gonna spend the
rest of his life in a 1-by-1 meter box.


516
00:29:26.157 --> 00:29:28.784
- Put the gun on him, Thomas.
- Hello, little guy.


517
00:29:28.785 --> 00:29:31.870
It's the sweetie man coming.

518
00:29:31.871 --> 00:29:35.499
Fuck. Look at this, Trent. Fuck.

519
00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.786
Thomas. Thomas, keep the gun
on him, he's definitely a criminal.


520
00:29:38.795 --> 00:29:40.629
He's got a whole
computer shop here.


521
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:42.422
He's going nowhere, boss.

522
00:29:42.423 --> 00:29:44.549
You know, this is amazing.
I mean, this...


523
00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:47.427
These are obviously, you can see,
stolen computers now...


524
00:29:47.428 --> 00:29:49.471
...that he's decorating his place with.

525
00:29:49.472 --> 00:29:52.091
Definitely doesn't have
a permit for this.


526
00:29:52.392 --> 00:29:55.469
Where is that fucking little runt?

527
00:29:56.979 --> 00:30:00.065
Hello, it's the sweetie man.

528
00:30:00.066 --> 00:30:01.817
Here's a sweetie...

529
00:30:01.818 --> 00:30:04.228
Hey, I've got a s...

530
00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.608
- Hey. Wikus.
- Trent, turn it off.


531
00:30:08.616 --> 00:30:12.035
- Turn off the fucking camera, man.
- Wikus, are you okay, boss?


532
00:30:12.036 --> 00:30:14.155
- Are you all right?
- Fuck off. Fuck off!


533
00:30:14.247 --> 00:30:15.781
Shit.

534
00:30:22.839 --> 00:30:25.207
- I said...
- All right, I'll switch it off.


535
00:30:25.758 --> 00:30:27.884
- Shall I leave him?
- Just leave him here.


536
00:30:27.885 --> 00:30:29.337
You're lucky.

537
00:30:29.345 --> 00:30:31.596
We'll come back for you tomorrow,
my friend.


538
00:30:31.597 --> 00:30:34.508
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow,
Christopher Johnson.


539
00:30:35.017 --> 00:30:38.770
<i>When dealing with aliens,
try to be polite but firm.</i>


540
00:30:38.771 --> 00:30:41.773
<i>- A smile is cheaper than a bullet.</i>
- Are you feeling better?


541
00:30:41.774 --> 00:30:43.817
- What?
- How are you feeling?


542
00:30:43.818 --> 00:30:48.648
I'm f... I'm fine. I'm all right.
I'm just... I'm a bit dizzy.


543
00:30:48.781 --> 00:30:53.110
Actually, just pull up there on the side.
I just wanna get something to eat here.


544
00:30:59.625 --> 00:31:03.788
Are you sure you should be having
that after your whole puking episode?


545
00:31:03.796 --> 00:31:05.380
I actually feel a lot better.

546
00:31:05.381 --> 00:31:07.416
- I think I needed to cleanse.
- Boss.


547
00:31:08.634 --> 00:31:10.010
Boss.

548
00:31:10.011 --> 00:31:12.220
- Boss. Your...
- Wikus, that's... That's...


549
00:31:12.221 --> 00:31:15.341
Black stuff coming out
of your nose there.


550

<i>Telephone call for Mr. Clark
on Line 5.</i>


551
00:32:19.247 --> 00:32:21.414
It's a silver cylinder.

552
00:32:21.415 --> 00:32:23.500
I can't find it.

553
00:32:23.501 --> 00:32:25.585
We must find it.

554
00:32:25.586 --> 00:32:28.038
It contains the fluid.

555
00:32:29.882 --> 00:32:31.091
It's not here.

556
00:32:31.092 --> 00:32:33.961
It has to be, keep looking.

557
00:32:50.152 --> 00:32:53.272
We trade for 10,000 cans.

558
00:32:56.367 --> 00:33:00.912
Certain factions of Nigerian gangs want
to extract weaponry from District 9...


559
00:33:00.913 --> 00:33:02.907
...and have been trying to for years.

560
00:33:03.416 --> 00:33:05.534
Give them one hundred cans.

561
00:33:06.877 --> 00:33:08.128
One hundred.

562
00:33:08.129 --> 00:33:10.088
Yes, yes, but we
take all of them now.

563
00:33:10.089 --> 00:33:11.298
All right, boys.

564
00:33:11.299 --> 00:33:13.834
Get them the cat food. Hurry up.

565
00:33:15.553 --> 00:33:20.015
And they amassed
thousands of these weapons...


566
00:33:20.016 --> 00:33:21.891
...without the ability to use them.

567
00:33:21.892 --> 00:33:23.101
Fuck off! Go!

568
00:33:23.102 --> 00:33:25.353
Hey, friend, not you. 
You stay here.

569
00:33:25.354 --> 00:33:26.855
What do you want with me?

570
00:33:26.856 --> 00:33:28.641
We just want to talk.

571
00:33:30.443 --> 00:33:31.685
Talk about what?

572
00:33:32.778 --> 00:33:35.064
Stupid prawn.
They'll believe anything.


573
00:33:35.072 --> 00:33:37.691
"Muti" is a South African word.

574
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:42.029
<i>Today, it's synonymous
with witch-doctory and magic.</i>


575
00:33:42.121 --> 00:33:44.122
You out it here.

576
00:33:44.123 --> 00:33:45.741
This is the heart.

577
00:33:46.167 --> 00:33:48.668
It cures high blood pressure
when you boil it.


578
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:51.872
It cures diabetes, all diseases.

<i>The Nigerians were consuming
alien body parts.</i>


580
00:33:57.678 --> 00:34:02.633
They believed that by doing so,
they were ingesting their power...


581
00:34:02.642 --> 00:34:05.143
<i>...to use alien weaponry.</i>

582
00:34:05.144 --> 00:34:06.929
You must eat them...

583
00:34:08.606 --> 00:34:12.476
...and their power will live in you.

584
00:34:16.238 --> 00:34:19.358
Just give me a fucking chance
to go in front of you, man.


585
00:34:28.709 --> 00:34:30.377
- Oh, baby, thank God.
- Hi, baby.


586
00:34:30.378 --> 00:34:32.212
- I need to get to the toilet.
- Why?


587
00:34:32.213 --> 00:34:34.547
- Why are the lights off'?
- What's the matter?


588
00:34:34.548 --> 00:34:38.711
- I might have crapped in my pants.
- Surprise!


589
00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:43.932
- What's this for?
- Your promotion.


590
00:34:43.933 --> 00:34:46.142
Oh, right. Got my promotion.

591
00:34:46.143 --> 00:34:48.512
- Oh, Dad, how's it going?
- Good to see you.


592
00:34:48.521 --> 00:34:51.682
Mom, how's it going? That's good.
Yeah, what a surprise, man.


593
00:34:51.691 --> 00:34:54.025
- Congrats on the promotion.
- Yeah, no, thanks.


594
00:34:54.026 --> 00:34:56.361
Congratulations, boss.
You're gonna be great.


595
00:34:56.362 --> 00:34:58.154
- Thanks.
- Wikus, what happened?


596
00:34:58.155 --> 00:35:01.282
Just had a small incident.
I'm just gonna go to the toilet...


597
00:35:01.283 --> 00:35:03.785
...and then I'll talk to the people, okay?

598
00:35:03.786 --> 00:35:06.788
- I need to talk to you. Come with me.
- Okay, I just gotta...


599
00:35:06.789 --> 00:35:09.749
- Guys, can you give us a moment?
- Sure, no problem.


600
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.668
What happened out there?

601
00:35:11.669 --> 00:35:13.495
A small incident.

602
00:35:13.504 --> 00:35:19.585
You know, an unruly prawn
and I just had to get him in my grasp.


603
00:35:19.593 --> 00:35:22.220
Listen to me, too many aliens
died out there today.


604
00:35:22.221 --> 00:35:25.215
UIO is all over my backside.

605
00:35:25.224 --> 00:35:29.219
Focus. You're not going
to fuck this up for me.


606
00:35:29.228 --> 00:35:32.932
If you can't do the job,
I'll find someone who can.


607
00:35:35.526 --> 00:35:38.520
- Hi, there.
- Hey, it's nice to see you again.


608
00:35:39.447 --> 00:35:43.074
Now, does this mean he's
in charge of this new operation?


609
00:35:43.075 --> 00:35:45.152
- Yes.
- That's nice, eh?


610
00:35:45.161 --> 00:35:48.614
Wikus? Baby, are you okay?

611
00:35:58.799 --> 00:36:01.092
Okay, let's cut some cake.

612
00:36:01.093 --> 00:36:03.636
<i>Cut some cake.</i>

613
00:36:03.637 --> 00:36:06.090
- He doesn't look very well.
- Are you all right?


614
00:36:15.065 --> 00:36:16.350
Just calm down, okay?

615
00:36:18.611 --> 00:36:20.521
Wikus.

616
00:36:33.209 --> 00:36:37.121
<i>Dr. Smith, please come to Room 405.
Dr. Smith.</i>


617
00:36:42.009 --> 00:36:43.961
Is it...? Is it badly infected?

618
00:36:43.969 --> 00:36:45.921
There's a lot of suppuration.

619
00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:48.306
Also, you should know
on my right hand...


620
00:36:48.307 --> 00:36:50.308
...some fingernails
were coming loose.


621
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:52.769
And I had a black fluid
coming out of my nose...


622
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.972
...and sort of a black vomit.

623
00:36:58.025 --> 00:36:59.442
What happened to my arm?

624
00:36:59.443 --> 00:37:01.528
- Just breathe deeply.
- What happened?


625
00:37:01.529 --> 00:37:03.238
- This is oxygen.
- What is this?


626
00:37:03.239 --> 00:37:05.107
Just breathe deeply. Calm down.

627
00:37:05.366 --> 00:37:09.236
- Stay calm.
- Doctor, tell my wife.


628
00:37:09.662 --> 00:37:12.156
Go tell my wife.

629
00:37:13.707 --> 00:37:18.920
<i>Attention, all medical staff members,
evacuate Ward 11 immediately.</i>


630
00:37:18.921 --> 00:37:23.917
<i>All medical staff members,
evacuate Ward 11 immediately.</i>


631
00:37:24.009 --> 00:37:26.295
Who the fuck are you, man?

632
00:37:27.429 --> 00:37:29.138
What the fuck is wrong with you?

633
00:37:29.139 --> 00:37:31.467
Fuck you! Fuck you!

634
00:37:32.351 --> 00:37:35.179
Get the fuck off me, you bitch! Fuck!

635
00:37:35.187 --> 00:37:37.473
What are you assholes
planning on doing?


636
00:37:38.607 --> 00:37:40.225
Stop right there, madam.

637
00:37:40.234 --> 00:37:43.103
What's going on?
What are you doing to him?


638
00:37:43.153 --> 00:37:44.688
- Let go of me!
- All right.


639
00:37:44.697 --> 00:37:47.824
- Let me through. Let me through!
- Good to go. Come on.


640
00:37:47.825 --> 00:37:50.034
- Wikus.
- Madam, get your hands off me.


641
00:37:50.035 --> 00:37:52.404
Where are you taking him?

642
00:37:53.873 --> 00:37:55.999
We have the infected agent on board.

643
00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.536
We're en route to MNU HQ
with an ETA of five minutes.


644
00:38:05.926 --> 00:38:08.003
Unzip it. Unzip it.

645
00:38:08.012 --> 00:38:09.512
Okay.

646
00:38:09.513 --> 00:38:12.424
- You got him? You ready?
- Yeah. Got him.


647
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.230
Decided not to use any anesthetic.

648
00:38:19.231 --> 00:38:22.025
The reason being, with nitrous,
the subject reacts to...


649
00:38:22.026 --> 00:38:24.485
- Blood pressure is way above normal.
- Calm down.


650
00:38:24.486 --> 00:38:28.489
The arm is doing
some really interesting things.


651
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.567
Aaron, what do you think
we've got here?


652
00:38:31.076 --> 00:38:35.697
We would have expected it to...
The antibodies to react and maintain.


653
00:38:35.706 --> 00:38:37.241
- Dr. Visser?
- Yes?


654
00:38:37.249 --> 00:38:38.867
I think you should see this.

655
00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.587
I found it in his jacket.

656
00:38:42.588 --> 00:38:44.213
Do you think this is alien?

657
00:38:44.214 --> 00:38:47.300
No. No. No.

658
00:38:47.301 --> 00:38:48.544
No, don't.

659
00:38:49.094 --> 00:38:51.630
Don't. No.

660
00:38:52.222 --> 00:38:54.716
Sons of bitches leave me... Fuck.

661
00:39:01.273 --> 00:39:03.308
Where is this?

662
00:39:07.404 --> 00:39:09.189
What?

663
00:39:11.742 --> 00:39:15.487
What...? What are they doing
to these prawns?


664
00:39:19.041 --> 00:39:21.626
Pain threshold, test one, DBX-7.

665
00:39:21.627 --> 00:39:24.746
<i>Commencing test one, DBX-7.</i>

666
00:39:28.592 --> 00:39:30.711
Now that's a strong pain reaction.

667
00:39:31.136 --> 00:39:33.763
That means the nerves have fused.

668
00:39:33.764 --> 00:39:36.933
I mean, it's almost
completely integrated.


669
00:39:36.934 --> 00:39:39.136
Okay, do it.

670
00:39:39.812 --> 00:39:42.855
- B5.
<i>- Testing AMR-B5.</i>


671
00:39:42.856 --> 00:39:45.559
All right. Okay.

672
00:39:45.567 --> 00:39:47.276
- Clear the range.
- Range fire.


673
00:39:47.277 --> 00:39:50.397
- Now. Quickly.
<i>- Quiet, please. We are now recording.</i>


674
00:39:50.406 --> 00:39:52.191
Swing it around.

675
00:39:52.533 --> 00:39:54.492
- What are you doing?
- There we go.


676
00:39:54.493 --> 00:39:55.986
What are you doing?

677
00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.538
- Can you grip that?
- What is this?


678
00:39:58.539 --> 00:40:01.325
- Put it through.
- Why are you doing that with the gun?


679
00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:03.376
- Stand by to fire.
- Stand by.


680
00:40:03.377 --> 00:40:05.954
- You want me to shoot that?
- Stand by.


681
00:40:05.963 --> 00:40:07.964
- Stand back.
- I cannot use this weapon.


682
00:40:07.965 --> 00:40:09.333
And fire.

683
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:13.670
<i>That's good.</i>

684
00:40:13.679 --> 00:40:16.931
- It worked. That's satisfactory.
<i>- AMR-B5 test complete.</i>


685
00:40:16.932 --> 00:40:19.434
Right. Thanks very much.
Load up another target.


686
00:40:19.435 --> 00:40:21.769
- You got this?
- Do you know where my wife is?


687
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:25.064
Do you know if my wife knows
where I am? Sir?


688
00:40:25.065 --> 00:40:27.517
Where's my wife?

689
00:40:28.152 --> 00:40:30.479
- Pull. Pull.
- I won't do that.


690
00:40:30.487 --> 00:40:32.113
No, sir, I will not pull it.

691
00:40:32.114 --> 00:40:34.490
What did you say about your wife?

692
00:40:34.491 --> 00:40:37.326
- Fuck your wife.
- No, sir. No, please, sir. I will...


693
00:40:37.327 --> 00:40:39.746
- I will not pull.
- Have to use the prod again.


694
00:40:39.747 --> 00:40:41.573
Fire.

695
00:40:45.294 --> 00:40:47.128
- B7.
<i>- AMR-B7.</i>


696
00:40:47.129 --> 00:40:49.213
- I'll pull it.
- He says he can pull it.


697
00:40:49.214 --> 00:40:50.749
I can pull the trigger.

698
00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:55.003
I said I would pull it.

699
00:40:55.012 --> 00:40:56.255
- You rotten pig!
- Fire.


700
00:40:58.724 --> 00:41:02.344
- B21.
<i>- AMR-B21.</i>


701
00:41:03.729 --> 00:41:06.022
Move. Hurry up. Move.

702
00:41:06.023 --> 00:41:08.149
We want him in the center,
by the chain.


703
00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.985
- Get this off me.
- Come on. Time. Time.


704
00:41:10.986 --> 00:41:14.447
Hey, leave that fucking prawn, man.
I will shoot a pig.


705
00:41:14.448 --> 00:41:17.784
I'll shoot... Sir.
Listen. I'll shoot a pig again for you.


706
00:41:17.785 --> 00:41:21.037
I'll pull the trigger, but I'm not
shooting that prawn, hear me?


707
00:41:21.038 --> 00:41:25.041
- Untie that fucking guy, man.
- B21. The human hand.


708
00:41:25.042 --> 00:41:26.876
That's good. It worked.

709
00:41:26.877 --> 00:41:30.163
<i>Just untie that guy.
Untie that guy, sir.</i>


710
00:41:30.172 --> 00:41:33.250
This is... You can't use the real guy.
He didn't do anything.


711
00:41:33.425 --> 00:41:37.178
Right. I wanna observe this one.
You prod him.


712
00:41:37.179 --> 00:41:39.430
- Everybody standing by.
- Let him go.


713
00:41:39.431 --> 00:41:40.640
Ready to go?

714
00:41:40.641 --> 00:41:43.601
- Don't use a... Oh, no.
- Three, two, one...


715
00:41:43.602 --> 00:41:45.220
- Don't, don't, don't.
- ...go.


716
00:41:48.315 --> 00:41:49.524
Amazing.

717
00:41:49.525 --> 00:41:52.561
<i>AMR
-B21 test completed.</i>

718
00:41:53.654 --> 00:41:57.149
All right. I think that's all we need.

719
00:41:58.534 --> 00:42:01.494
Gentlemen,
you're running out of time.


720
00:42:01.495 --> 00:42:04.573
This is the key stage
in the metamorphosis.


721
00:42:04.915 --> 00:42:08.744
His DNA is in perfect balance
between alien and human.


722
00:42:08.752 --> 00:42:12.088
The problem is,
as the infection spreads...


723
00:42:12.089 --> 00:42:14.958
...the transition becomes
permanent and less active.


724
00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:17.969
He's going to turn into one of them,
a prawn?


725
00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.887
What happens to him isn't important.

726
00:42:19.888 --> 00:42:23.467
What's important is that we harvest
from him what we can right now.


727
00:42:25.018 --> 00:42:28.020
This body represents
hundreds of millions...


728
00:42:28.021 --> 00:42:31.440
...maybe billions of dollars
worth of biotechnology.


729
00:42:31.441 --> 00:42:35.695
There are people out there,
governments, corporations...


730
00:42:35.696 --> 00:42:37.898
...who would kill for this chance.

731
00:42:38.574 --> 00:42:41.576
- Will he survive the procedure?
- No, of course not.


732
00:42:41.577 --> 00:42:45.663
We need everything.
Tissue, bone marrow, blood.


733
00:42:45.664 --> 00:42:49.458
The procedure's gonna basically
strip him down to nothing.


734
00:42:49.459 --> 00:42:51.169
What about next of kin?

735
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:55.006
Please, help me. 
Don't let them do it.

736
00:42:55.007 --> 00:42:56.500
I'll handle that.

737
00:42:58.343 --> 00:43:00.136
Okay. I say, let's go.

738
00:43:00.137 --> 00:43:02.547
Good. Thank you.

739
00:43:12.691 --> 00:43:17.854
I don't understand.
None of this makes any sense.


740
00:43:17.863 --> 00:43:21.233
He just hurt his arm, Dad.

741
00:43:22.242 --> 00:43:24.111
The doctors are trying, sweetheart.

742
00:43:25.662 --> 00:43:28.323
They're doing their best to save him.

743
00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:33.169
We're starting to harvest material
from the specimen.


744
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:36.464
We'll start with soft tissue first.
Cut through the chest cavity.


745
00:43:36.465 --> 00:43:38.799
We need to get the heart out quickly.

746
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.796
Once the septicemia set in,
it just spread.


747
00:43:42.804 --> 00:43:45.890
- Don't touch me with this gas!
- Calm down.


748
00:43:45.891 --> 00:43:47.801
You know Wikus.

749
00:43:48.393 --> 00:43:50.262
He never was very strong.

750
00:43:51.939 --> 00:43:54.565
I'll go through the chest,
straight into the heart.


751
00:43:54.566 --> 00:43:56.601
- That should quiet him down.
- Fuck you!


752
00:43:56.777 --> 00:43:58.353
Can I see him?

753
00:44:01.698 --> 00:44:03.150
Not a good idea.

754
00:44:08.872 --> 00:44:10.615
Fuck you. Fuck you!

755
00:44:12.209 --> 00:44:15.745
You don't fucking come near me.
Don't fucking come near me.


756
00:44:22.469 --> 00:44:24.921
Fuck you. You big fucking man, huh?

757
00:44:27.808 --> 00:44:29.509
Hey. Hey. Drop the knife.

758
00:44:29.518 --> 00:44:33.271
Fuck you! Drop that thing
or I'll fucking cut his eyes out.


759
00:44:33.272 --> 00:44:36.349
Okay. All right. Okay.

760
00:44:37.442 --> 00:44:40.812
- We're gonna get you, mate.
- I'll fucking kill you. I'll kill you.


761
00:44:50.163 --> 00:44:53.158
You need to let go of him now.

762
00:44:55.836 --> 00:45:00.999
That's okay, Tania.
Everything will be okay.


763
00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:10.550
Smit.

764
00:45:12.728 --> 00:45:14.429
When?

765
00:45:17.399 --> 00:45:18.642
Get Koobus.

766
00:45:44.634 --> 00:45:46.086
Hey, hey, wait, man.

767
00:45:56.396 --> 00:46:00.308
<i>Wikus van de Merwe,
white male, mid-30s...</i>


768
00:46:00.317 --> 00:46:02.352
<i>...is considered highly dangerous.</i>

769
00:46:02.361 --> 00:46:03.569
- Hello?
- Hi, baby.


770
00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:05.738
<i>- Wikus? Is that you?</i>
- It's Wikus...


771
00:46:05.739 --> 00:46:08.199
- Mrs. Smit? Hi.
<i>- How dare you phone us.</i>


772
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:11.160
- What are all these people doing?
- None of your business.


773
00:46:11.161 --> 00:46:13.412
I need to speak
to Tania straightaway.


774
00:46:13.413 --> 00:46:16.040
It's my house. This is my
phone that you are using.


775
00:46:16.041 --> 00:46:18.410
- I'm fucking... What?
<i>- It's</i> disgusting.


776
00:46:19.628 --> 00:46:22.588
- He tried calling me.
- Anton, it's me. It's me. Accept...


777
00:46:22.589 --> 00:46:24.048
Accept the call.

778
00:46:24.049 --> 00:46:27.502
I've been friends with you
for fucking 19 years, man.


779
00:46:27.511 --> 00:46:30.096
Fuck off! What are you
watching, man? Fuck off!


780
00:46:30.097 --> 00:46:32.882
We thought it was for the best
because he needed help.


781
00:46:34.059 --> 00:46:37.895
Special medical help. And he wasn't
gonna get that as a fugitive.


782
00:46:37.896 --> 00:46:39.806
Move, move, move.

783
00:46:42.234 --> 00:46:43.442
Go, go, go!

784
00:46:43.443 --> 00:46:48.898
<i>He became the most valuable
business artifact on Earth.</i>


785
00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.244
He was the only human
who had ever...


786
00:46:53.245 --> 00:46:57.407
...successfully been combined with
alien genetics and remained alive.


787
00:46:57.666 --> 00:47:02.120
<i>But his real value was that
he could operate alien weaponry.</i>


788
00:47:10.137 --> 00:47:11.470
Hello.

789
00:47:11.471 --> 00:47:15.433
Can I get seven schnitzel burgers
and a large sauer klopse, please?


790
00:47:15.434 --> 00:47:18.269
<i>We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.</i>


791
00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:22.690
<i>A patient has escaped from the
isolation ward and is loose in the city.</i>


792
00:47:22.691 --> 00:47:25.276
<i>Wikus van de Merwe
was recently apprehended...</i>


793
00:47:25.277 --> 00:47:29.356
<i>...after prolonged sexual activity
with aliens in District 9.</i>


794
00:47:29.364 --> 00:47:30.739
Oh, you <i>bliksem.</i>

795
00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.158
I have to call my manager.

796
00:47:32.159 --> 00:47:35.161
That's totally untrue.
You are legally obliged to serve me.


797
00:47:35.162 --> 00:47:37.204
<i>...which is causing
bodily disfigurement.</i>


798
00:47:37.205 --> 00:47:39.707
Can I buy your burger, please?
If I could just...


799
00:47:39.708 --> 00:47:41.500
<i>- It's contagious.</i>
- Don't listen.


800
00:47:41.501 --> 00:47:44.663
<i>Police warn people to stay
at least 20 meters away.</i>


801
00:47:44.671 --> 00:47:46.964
No, look at this hand.
This hand is fine!


802
00:47:46.965 --> 00:47:50.801
<i>If you have any information regarding
the whereabouts of van de Merwe...</i>


803
00:47:50.802 --> 00:47:54.305
<i>...please contact us immediately
on 0-800-STOP-WIKUS.</i>


804
00:47:54.306 --> 00:47:57.592
<i>- You fucking freak! Stop!
- Don't go away, after the break...</i>


805
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:10.070
<i>- Hi. This is Tania.
- And Wikus.</i>


806
00:48:10.071 --> 00:48:14.533
<i>We can't come to the phone right now.
Please leave a message. Bye.</i>


807
00:48:14.534 --> 00:48:17.612
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Good things!</i>


808
00:48:27.255 --> 00:48:31.050
<i>Control, this is Bird Dog 7. We're
set up at all major exits to the city.</i>


809
00:48:31.051 --> 00:48:36.381
<i>There's no sign of Mr. van de Merwe.
We are in total lockdown at this point.</i>


810
00:48:58.787 --> 00:49:03.082
<i>The entire world was watching him.</i>

811
00:49:03.083 --> 00:49:07.245
<i>He was on every radio station,
every image on television.</i>


812
00:49:07.254 --> 00:49:10.130
Anything you could find
had his face on it.


813
00:49:10.131 --> 00:49:11.833
So he had nowhere else to go.

814
00:49:12.717 --> 00:49:15.628
<i>He ended up hiding
in the one place he knew...</i>


815
00:49:15.637 --> 00:49:18.882
<i>...no one would ever come
looking for him.</i>


816
00:50:38.136 --> 00:50:41.464
I'm not playing here.

817
00:50:41.556 --> 00:50:43.724
I pay you next week, I promise.

818
00:50:43.725 --> 00:50:45.559
No money, you get nothing.

819
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:48.388
Fucking prawn, this isn't a charity.

820
00:50:50.982 --> 00:50:54.727
Hello. I'd like to buy
some meat, please.


821
00:50:56.571 --> 00:51:00.824
Yes, have you got hamburger
or, you know, steak roll?


822
00:51:00.825 --> 00:51:03.361
Does it look like a hamburger shop?

823
00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:05.329
- Which one do you want?
- Goat, then.


824
00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:08.992
Come on, come on, come on, man.
I don't have all day here.


825
00:51:09.167 --> 00:51:11.126
- Is that cat food there?
- Yeah, it is.


826
00:51:11.127 --> 00:51:13.671
That's cat food, eh?
I'll have some of that, guys.


827
00:51:13.672 --> 00:51:14.914
- Is that all?
- Yeah.


828
00:51:36.111 --> 00:51:37.353
Fuck, man.

829
00:51:58.174 --> 00:52:01.169
Hello? Hello?

830
00:52:01.636 --> 00:52:03.212
Ba...

831
00:52:04.139 --> 00:52:07.474
Baby, is that you? Tania?

832
00:52:07.475 --> 00:52:10.011
Oh, God, please, let it be you.

833
00:52:10.353 --> 00:52:14.064
<i>- Yes, it's me.</i>
- Baby...


834
00:52:14.065 --> 00:52:16.859
I'm so happy you called me, baby.

835
00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:21.155
<i>- Wikus, listen to me.</i>
- Okay.


836
00:52:21.156 --> 00:52:25.367
<i>I have something to say to you
and it's not gonna be easy.</i>


837
00:52:25.368 --> 00:52:28.363
No, okay, look. Listen, baby,
before you say anything.


838
00:52:28.705 --> 00:52:32.200
Your father is working against me,
baby. He's lying to you.


839
00:52:32.542 --> 00:52:36.037
I did not have
sex with one of these...

840
00:52:36.379 --> 00:52:37.997
...fucking creatures, man.

841
00:52:38.006 --> 00:52:40.841
I would never have
any kind of pornographic activity...


842
00:52:40.842 --> 00:52:43.802
...with a fucking creature. Baby...

843
00:52:43.803 --> 00:52:46.798
<i>But they said that you'd become
obsessed with them.</i>


844
00:52:47.307 --> 00:52:49.141
<i>I can't do this.</i>

845
00:52:49.142 --> 00:52:52.095
Baby, please, don't give up on me,
you know?


846
00:52:52.103 --> 00:52:56.064
Don't give up on me
because I can... I...


847
00:52:56.065 --> 00:52:59.193
I wanna see you again, baby.
And I'm gonna fix my arm...


848
00:52:59.194 --> 00:53:01.320
...and I'm gonna see you again...

849
00:53:01.321 --> 00:53:04.114
...and I'm gonna kiss you
and I'm gonna hold you again.


850
00:53:04.115 --> 00:53:07.610
<i>I don't want you to hold me again.</i>

851
00:53:10.246 --> 00:53:12.115
Baby?

852
00:53:14.042 --> 00:53:16.160
Baby?

853
00:53:28.932 --> 00:53:33.386
Hey, hey. What the...?
Hey, hey. Hey, man. Hey.


854
00:53:52.705 --> 00:53:54.407
Okay.

855
00:54:20.275 --> 00:54:22.150
<i>...directly to the left of us.</i>

856
00:54:22.151 --> 00:54:25.063
<i>Roger that. I'll send you
a couple choppers back up and...</i>


857
00:54:45.633 --> 00:54:46.876
You!

858
00:54:47.635 --> 00:54:49.754
What do you want?

859
00:54:53.683 --> 00:54:56.844
Copy, control. No sign of the target.
Moving to Sector 6.


860
00:54:57.353 --> 00:54:59.062
You have to go.

861
00:54:59.063 --> 00:55:01.474
Okay, please, I need your help. Okay?

862
00:55:02.775 --> 00:55:05.394
Okay. We gonna play hide and seek.

863
00:55:05.486 --> 00:55:06.528
Yes! Yes!

864
00:55:06.529 --> 00:55:07.613
You wanna help me hide?

865
00:55:07.614 --> 00:55:08.822
No, get back.

866
00:55:08.823 --> 00:55:10.115
Show me your favorite hiding place.

867
00:55:10.116 --> 00:55:12.451
Please, just go.

868
00:55:12.452 --> 00:55:13.702
Leave us alone.

869
00:55:13.703 --> 00:55:16.697
No. Please, you don't...
I need to hide.


870
00:55:16.706 --> 00:55:20.459
Okay? They're coming.
They wanna kill me. All right?


871
00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:24.747
I just need to hide here, sir,
for five minutes. Okay? I just need to...


872
00:55:35.516 --> 00:55:39.186
What is this <i>kak?</i> What are you
doing here? I remember you.


873
00:55:39.187 --> 00:55:41.313
Nothing. You must hide
somewhere else.


874
00:55:41.314 --> 00:55:45.393
Please, sir, you have to help me. I'm
losing blood. They're trying to kill me.


875
00:55:58.456 --> 00:56:01.784
Only one thing
that could make that happen.


876
00:56:01.876 --> 00:56:06.664
Quick, we have to hide him.

877
00:56:08.841 --> 00:56:10.126
Now you, get down there.

878
00:56:22.313 --> 00:56:24.189
Where the fuck I am?

879
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.399
Where's the fluid?

880
00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.984
What did you do with it?

881
00:56:26.985 --> 00:56:28.227
Please.

882
00:56:28.236 --> 00:56:29.478
You took it.

883
00:56:29.487 --> 00:56:30.737
I don't know what you're talking about.

884
00:56:30.738 --> 00:56:32.197
I know you did.

885
00:56:32.198 --> 00:56:35.276
I can see what's happening to you.

886
00:56:35.785 --> 00:56:38.362
Tell me where it is.

887
00:56:39.706 --> 00:56:41.574
Right, right.

888
00:56:42.333 --> 00:56:44.501
Was it a black fluid
in a glass container?


889
00:56:44.502 --> 00:56:47.747
Yes, that's it. Yes!

890
00:56:47.839 --> 00:56:51.633
Right. I confiscated it,
and the guys at the lab took it.


891
00:56:51.634 --> 00:56:53.878
It'll be at MNU. MNU has it.

892
00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.174
Okay. Okay.

893
00:57:04.147 --> 00:57:06.140
What is this?

894
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:07.642
You ruined everything.

895
00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:09.685
Where is this?

896
00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:14.982
Is that your shack?

897
00:57:16.743 --> 00:57:19.453
This whole thing's
under your shack?


898
00:57:19.454 --> 00:57:23.741
For 20 years you've had this fucking
thing hidden down here. This is...


899
00:57:24.375 --> 00:57:26.543
This is very illegal.

900
00:57:26.544 --> 00:57:30.589
I mean, this is a fine,
you know, if they...


901
00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:32.124
If they catch you with this.

902
00:57:34.969 --> 00:57:37.380
Fuel goes in here!

903
00:57:37.638 --> 00:57:40.132
That's enough! Quiet!

904
00:57:40.141 --> 00:57:42.218
Then we fly away.

905
00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:44.519
I said quiet! We cannot trust him.

906
00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:48.440
What is he saying about the fuel?
Are you trying to start this thing?


907
00:57:48.441 --> 00:57:52.228
Are you little fuckers
trying to start this and get away, eh?


908
00:57:52.487 --> 00:57:54.230
Never mind.

909
00:57:54.238 --> 00:57:56.482
Yeah, you sneaky
fucking prawns, eh?


910
00:57:56.824 --> 00:57:59.110
Too bad. I could've fixed you.

911
00:57:59.452 --> 00:58:04.039
What? What did you say
about the fixing?


912
00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.582
What, you could fix me?

913
00:58:05.583 --> 00:58:06.826
Forget it.

914
00:58:07.418 --> 00:58:09.211
It doesn't matter, it's too late.

915
00:58:09.212 --> 00:58:13.632
No. No. Listen, listen. Are you saying
that you could turn this...


916
00:58:13.633 --> 00:58:17.219
This prawn hand into a human hand?
You can make me human again?


917
00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:22.049
We have medical machines on
the mother ship that can fix you. Yes.


918
00:58:22.475 --> 00:58:26.095
We can use this
ship to fly up there.

919
00:58:26.104 --> 00:58:28.563
That's fantastic.
You guys are brilliant, eh?


920
00:58:28.564 --> 00:58:30.899
I always thought
the prawns were intelligent.


921
00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.567
Let's do it.

922
00:58:32.568 --> 00:58:34.903
I don't have fluid.

923
00:58:34.904 --> 00:58:39.942
I could fix you and I could fly away.
But I don't have fluid.


924
00:58:39.951 --> 00:58:41.910
Right. Right. Okay.

925
00:58:41.911 --> 00:58:45.372
All right, I'll tell you
what, why don't we go...?


926
00:58:45.373 --> 00:58:47.707
Let's get some more.
Let's go collect some up.


927
00:58:47.708 --> 00:58:52.163
It took 20 years
to collect that amount.


928
00:58:52.171 --> 00:58:55.298
Fuck, man. Fuck!

929
00:58:55.299 --> 00:58:58.635
Fuck! The only one
is the one I confiscated?


930
00:58:58.636 --> 00:59:00.338
Yes.

931
00:59:00.555 --> 00:59:02.548
It's four stories under ground.

932
00:59:09.605 --> 00:59:11.606
Why's he keep looking at me like that?

933
00:59:11.607 --> 00:59:13.476
He likes you.

934
00:59:13.901 --> 00:59:15.443
We are the same.

935
00:59:15.444 --> 00:59:18.947
Fuck off, man. 
I'm not the same.

936
00:59:18.948 --> 00:59:21.400
Not the fucking same.

937
00:59:27.707 --> 00:59:29.617
There is a way out of this.

938
00:59:29.834 --> 00:59:34.288
We get the fluid back from MNU.

939
00:59:35.339 --> 00:59:39.293
And what then? Then we both die, eh?
Both of us dead.


940
00:59:39.635 --> 00:59:41.428
That's a suicide mission.

941
00:59:41.429 --> 00:59:44.298
Can you not fill my head
with that sort of nonsense?


942
00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:49.053
The transformation is accelerating.

943
00:59:51.439 --> 00:59:54.433
You do not have much time.

944
00:59:55.610 --> 00:59:58.145
Oh, Christ.

945
01:00:24.096 --> 01:00:26.507
Fuck. Okay.

946
01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:47.820
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

947
01:01:11.936 --> 01:01:14.688
- Hello?
- Wikus?


948
01:01:14.689 --> 01:01:18.316
- Tania? Baby.
<i>- Are you okay?</i>


949
01:01:18.317 --> 01:01:20.402
Oh, God. Thank God.

950
01:01:20.403 --> 01:01:22.771
<i>Where are you?</i>

951
01:01:26.492 --> 01:01:29.411
<i>All those things my father said...</i>

952
01:01:29.412 --> 01:01:32.072
<i>I know he was trying to protect me.</i>

953
01:01:33.499 --> 01:01:36.376
<i>I just don't know
what to believe anymore.</i>


954
01:01:36.377 --> 01:01:39.546
Baby, baby, I know, but listen to me.
It's all lies.


955
01:01:39.547 --> 01:01:43.667
I swear to you.
Everything he said to you is lies.


956
01:01:43.968 --> 01:01:45.260
<i>I know.</i>

957
01:01:45.261 --> 01:01:48.047
What? What?

958
01:01:48.389 --> 01:01:51.766
<i>I believe you, Wikus.
I just want you back.</i>


959
01:01:51.767 --> 01:01:54.269
<i>I want everything back
the way it was.</i>


960
01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:59.149
That's... Baby, that's what I want.
That's what... That's great.


961
01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:04.230
That's great news. I can make it
the way it was, if you take me back.


962
01:02:04.405 --> 01:02:08.901
<i>But how? How can we go back?</i>

963
01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:15.749
I have a plan, and I know how to fix it.
All right?


964
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:18.168
I know how to fix myself.
And it'll be me...


965
01:02:18.169 --> 01:02:20.246
...and we'll be back together.

966
01:02:20.629 --> 01:02:22.714
<i>You promise me?</i>

967
01:02:22.715 --> 01:02:24.917
I promise you, baby.

968
01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:31.556
Don't give up on me, okay? Because
I haven't given up on you, all right?


969
01:02:31.557 --> 01:02:33.133
<i>I won't.</i>

970
01:02:33.476 --> 01:02:35.560
<i>I love you.</i>

971
01:02:35.561 --> 01:02:38.264
<i>I love you too.</i>

972
01:02:38.939 --> 01:02:41.183
- Tell me you got a fix on him.
- D-9.


973
01:02:49.867 --> 01:02:52.403
How many moons
does our planet have?


974
01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:59.535
Seven.

975
01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:04.415
This planet only has one.

976
01:03:05.132 --> 01:03:07.342
I can't wait to see our planet.

977
01:03:07.343 --> 01:03:09.135
It is bigger than this one, isn't it?

978
01:03:09.136 --> 01:03:11.547
Enough.

979
01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.174
We go home now?

980
01:03:15.184 --> 01:03:19.013
Not home. No.

981
01:03:19.188 --> 01:03:23.350
This is where we must go.

982
01:03:23.818 --> 01:03:25.527
See that tent there?

983
01:03:25.528 --> 01:03:27.146
That might be ours.

984
01:03:28.697 --> 01:03:31.650
I want to go home!

985
01:03:32.827 --> 01:03:38.866
We can't go home. Not anymore.

986
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:48.042
Hi. You don't wanna go to the tents.
They're not better.


987
01:03:48.050 --> 01:03:50.093
They're smaller than the shacks.

988
01:03:50.094 --> 01:03:52.671
Actually more like
a concentration camp.


989
01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:57.926
If I can get you that black fluid,
what happens then?


990
01:03:58.102 --> 01:04:00.145
We go up to the mother ship.

991
01:04:00.146 --> 01:04:02.389
And you can start that thing?

992
01:04:02.398 --> 01:04:03.682
Yes.

993
01:04:04.233 --> 01:04:09.313
Okay. So just to be clear,
this is gonna go back...


994
01:04:10.698 --> 01:04:15.076
This is gonna go back
to be human like this.


995
01:04:15.077 --> 01:04:16.612
I can go home.

996
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:19.706
And then, you can go home.
You can take your boy.


997
01:04:19.707 --> 01:04:23.160
You can take all the prawns.
If I could get you that fluid, right?


998
01:04:23.794 --> 01:04:27.206
You said it was a suicide mission.

999
01:04:27.798 --> 01:04:29.750
Maybe you were right.

1000
01:04:30.176 --> 01:04:34.004
We have no weapons.
They'll shoot us on sight.


1001
01:04:35.181 --> 01:04:38.008
Look. Look, Christopher.

1002
01:04:38.434 --> 01:04:41.136
I know where we can get weapons.

1003
01:04:49.028 --> 01:04:52.481
Hi, guys. Hello. Hi, hi. Hello.

1004
01:04:53.908 --> 01:04:57.486
- I'd like to buy some weapons, please.
- No, no, no. Hold it.


1005
01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.988
How did you do this one, my man?

1006
01:05:01.332 --> 01:05:04.243
It's doggy-style with a demon.

1007
01:05:05.628 --> 01:05:07.579
You're one brave white man.

1008
01:05:07.588 --> 01:05:09.748
Were you wearing a condom?

1009
01:05:11.008 --> 01:05:14.044
I need to buy weapons, please.

1010
01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:18.932
You and I both know that
there are illegal weapons inside there.


1011
01:05:18.933 --> 01:05:23.804
I have money and I would like to buy
some of those wea...


1012
01:05:24.188 --> 01:05:27.099
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1013
01:05:29.276 --> 01:05:32.612
- I brought you here to make me money.
- Sit. Don't move around.


1014
01:05:32.613 --> 01:05:35.524
You're fucking wasting my time.

1015
01:05:36.492 --> 01:05:39.862
Shut up. Fucking lying bitch.

1016
01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:50.956
Thank... Thank you, sir, for your time.
Thank you very much for seeing me.


1017
01:05:52.299 --> 01:05:54.126
I would like to buy some weapons.

1018
01:05:54.134 --> 01:05:59.681
AK-47, some grenades,
maybe tear-gas canisters.


1019
01:05:59.682 --> 01:06:01.849
I see you have limpet mines here,
as well.


1020
01:06:01.850 --> 01:06:06.604
And I also see you guys have
alien weapons there, which is great.


1021
01:06:06.605 --> 01:06:09.315
I could have one or two of those.

1022
01:06:09.316 --> 01:06:12.151
I have money, okay?

1023
01:06:12.152 --> 01:06:14.688
Now, I'm s...

1024
01:06:18.117 --> 01:06:20.652
Sir. Please, sir. Please, sir.
Please, sir.


1025
01:06:20.953 --> 01:06:22.404
I've heard about you.

1026
01:06:22.955 --> 01:06:24.163
Where do you have it?

1027
01:06:24.164 --> 01:06:25.783
Show me.

1028
01:06:26.208 --> 01:06:27.493
Oh, shit!

1029
01:06:28.877 --> 01:06:30.621
Come here. Come.

1030
01:06:32.172 --> 01:06:34.625
Shit.

1031
01:06:37.261 --> 01:06:40.798
No, no, no. No, please.

1032
01:06:44.143 --> 01:06:48.597
Why are you doing that? Why is he...?
What is he...? What do you want?


1033
01:06:48.897 --> 01:06:50.440
- What do you...?
- Shut up.


1034
01:06:50.441 --> 01:06:52.275
Please.

1035
01:06:52.276 --> 01:06:53.484
Sir, don't.

1036
01:06:53.485 --> 01:06:56.154
Forget the weapons.
Forget the weapons.


1037
01:06:56.155 --> 01:06:57.447
Forget the weapons.

1038
01:06:57.448 --> 01:06:59.365
I want the arm. Cut it off.

1039
01:06:59.366 --> 01:07:02.076
What's he saying?
What does he want? What did he say?


1040
01:07:02.077 --> 01:07:04.822
What does he want? 
What does he...?

1041
01:07:14.006 --> 01:07:16.416
I'll show you. 
I'm gonna teach you.

1042
01:07:16.884 --> 01:07:18.126
Hey, hey, hey.

1043
01:07:19.762 --> 01:07:21.088
Holy shit.

1044
01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:28.637
You tell them to stand down.

1045
01:07:33.901 --> 01:07:35.735
You tell them to be quiet.

1046
01:07:35.736 --> 01:07:38.939
You, back off. 
Put your gun down.

1047
01:07:39.406 --> 01:07:41.824
Tell them to put the weapons
in the bag, man.


1048
01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:45.404
Fuck. Give me
the fucking weapons, man.


1049
01:07:46.497 --> 01:07:48.115
Don't you fucking look at me.

1050
01:07:49.541 --> 01:07:53.579
I said don't fucking look at me.

1051
01:07:58.050 --> 01:07:59.793
How did you get that hand?

1052
01:08:02.054 --> 01:08:03.304
Fucking hurry up, man.

1053
01:08:03.305 --> 01:08:05.139
Look at me
when I fucking speak to you.


1054
01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.550
What is your secret?

1055
01:08:06.558 --> 01:08:07.850
What did you do?

1056
01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:09.469
Tell me.

1057
01:08:10.854 --> 01:08:12.639
I want that fucking arm.

1058
01:08:13.273 --> 01:08:14.766
What the fuck did you do?

1059
01:08:14.942 --> 01:08:16.984
You fucking <i>mizungo</i>,
I'm coming for you.


1060
01:08:16.985 --> 01:08:18.785
I'm coming for you.
I'm going to get you.


1061
01:08:20.322 --> 01:08:21.781
Drop the fucking knife.

1062
01:08:21.782 --> 01:08:24.568
- Drop your fucking knife!
- Easy, easy.


1063
01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:34.502
And no live ammo.
He's useless to us dead.


1064
01:08:34.503 --> 01:08:36.254
Would you relax?

1065
01:08:36.255 --> 01:08:40.208
For fuck's sakes. My men have
done this a hundred times before.


1066
01:08:40.217 --> 01:08:44.171
Maintaining a visual on that location
at November-Alpha-1-9-1-1.


1067
01:08:44.179 --> 01:08:47.299
- The unit is closing in now, sir.
<i>- It's gonna be quick.</i>


1068
01:08:48.142 --> 01:08:50.344
<i>It's gonna be clean.</i>

1069
01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:52.638
<i>And best of all...</i>

1070
01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:55.349
...it's gonna be quiet.

1071
01:08:55.649 --> 01:08:58.894
Van de Mervve hasn't got a clue
what's coming his way.


1072
01:09:02.448 --> 01:09:03.990
It's empty.

1073
01:09:03.991 --> 01:09:05.400
Where are they?

1074
01:09:06.118 --> 01:09:08.870
The target is gone.
The place is empty.


1075
01:09:08.871 --> 01:09:11.531
<i>What do you mean, "empty"?
Where the fuck is he?</i>


1076
01:09:12.082 --> 01:09:15.376
That little shithead has got no idea
what's coming his way.


1077
01:09:15.377 --> 01:09:17.037
I'm gonna find him.

1078
01:09:21.425 --> 01:09:24.969
<i>Security breach, Level 2.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

<i>Do not use...</i>

1080
01:09:26.722 --> 01:09:30.767
There are the guards. At the gate.
Watch the guards at the gate, man.


1081
01:09:30.768 --> 01:09:32.386
Come on.

1082
01:09:34.354 --> 01:09:37.482
<i>Security breach, Level 2.
Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>


1083
01:09:37.483 --> 01:09:40.227
Move. Get out. Get out!

1084
01:09:41.987 --> 01:09:44.439
- Don't shoot!
- Go.


1085
01:09:45.449 --> 01:09:47.567
Going down. Four stories down.

1086
01:09:47.951 --> 01:09:50.661
This is alien weaponry.
Give me a status report.


1087
01:09:50.662 --> 01:09:52.622
<i>Security breach, Level 4. Bio lab.</i>

1088
01:09:52.623 --> 01:09:55.917
- It's van de Merwe. He's on Level 4.
- Switch to live ammo.


1089
01:09:55.918 --> 01:09:58.544
- We're taking him out.
- Colonel.


1090
01:09:58.545 --> 01:10:00.755
We were ordered
not to use live ammunition.


1091
01:10:00.756 --> 01:10:03.250
- They want him alive.
<i>- Security breach, Level 4.</i>


1092
01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:09.347
Okay. Stay here until I call you.

1093
01:10:09.348 --> 01:10:10.598
I understand.

1094
01:10:10.599 --> 01:10:12.266
I need to get the door open.

1095
01:10:12.267 --> 01:10:14.678
<i>Possible alien tissue detected.</i>

1096
01:10:14.686 --> 01:10:16.479
I said, stay until I call you.

1097
01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:19.558
<i>Wait for the decontamination
process to finish before...</i>


1098
01:10:19.566 --> 01:10:21.643
You trying to get yourself killed?

1099
01:10:23.654 --> 01:10:24.938
Fuck!

1100
01:10:26.114 --> 01:10:28.066
I thought you said not to kill them?

1101
01:10:28.951 --> 01:10:31.111
He shot at me.

1102
01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:36.332
Open up! Get the fuck out!
Don't fucking look at me. Get out!


1103
01:10:36.333 --> 01:10:37.868
Get the fuck out!

1104
01:10:43.090 --> 01:10:44.666
Okay.

1105
01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:54.968
- Move, move, move.
- Get out! Everybody get the fuck out!


1106
01:10:54.977 --> 01:10:58.271
Get out! Go! Move out of here now!

1107
01:10:58.272 --> 01:11:01.308
I'll send you home
in a fucking jar. Go!


1108
01:11:01.942 --> 01:11:03.192
What is this place?

1109
01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:05.479
Don't worry about that.

1110
01:11:05.904 --> 01:11:07.238
What do they do in here?

1111
01:11:07.239 --> 01:11:09.024
It's in one of these.

1112
01:11:10.826 --> 01:11:12.493
Check these. Check these boxes.

1113
01:11:12.494 --> 01:11:16.531
Any kind of a box that looks like
it can hold a tube. Just check that.


1114
01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:18.492
These fuckers.

1115
01:11:21.753 --> 01:11:23.914
Go, go!

1116
01:11:26.133 --> 01:11:27.709
Clear.

1117
01:11:32.639 --> 01:11:35.926
<i>- Security breach...</i>
- I got it! I got it.


1118
01:11:39.146 --> 01:11:42.641
Chris, I got it. Let's go. Let's go.

1119
01:11:43.483 --> 01:11:45.560
Christopher.

1120
01:11:48.572 --> 01:11:49.815
Oh, fuck.

1121
01:11:50.574 --> 01:11:55.161
Listen. Listen, I didn't... I promise you,
I didn't know they were doing this.


1122
01:11:55.162 --> 01:11:58.956
Until they brought me here the other
day, I swear to you, I did not know...


1123
01:11:58.957 --> 01:12:01.292
...they were doing this, but...
Christopher.


1124
01:12:01.293 --> 01:12:03.836
Christopher, listen, look at me.
Listen to me.


1125
01:12:03.837 --> 01:12:06.672
We need to leave now. Okay?

1126
01:12:06.673 --> 01:12:09.175
The whole of MNU is gonna
come down here.


1127
01:12:09.176 --> 01:12:11.044
He's going to destroy us.

1128
01:12:12.054 --> 01:12:15.340
We are big, but quick.
We can do this.


1129
01:12:15.349 --> 01:12:18.009
- Okay, we're gonna get out of here.
- Target. Fire!


1130
01:12:19.811 --> 01:12:21.054
Move, move, move.

1131
01:12:23.607 --> 01:12:25.058
Move down the row. Move.

1132
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:33.692
- Fuck.
- Move close.


1133
01:12:34.076 --> 01:12:35.569
You fucking bastard.

1134
01:12:35.577 --> 01:12:38.196
- Christopher, what are you doing?
- Two o'clock.


1135
01:12:38.622 --> 01:12:40.073
Cover the sides.

1136
01:12:43.001 --> 01:12:44.870
The bugs, the bugs, the bugs!

1137
01:12:46.129 --> 01:12:49.207
Think of your boy, for fuck's sake.

1138
01:12:57.975 --> 01:13:00.893
What are you doing?
Are you out of your fucking mind?


1139
01:13:00.894 --> 01:13:02.345
Move, move!

1140
01:13:03.814 --> 01:13:05.189
You'll get us killed.

1141
01:13:05.190 --> 01:13:07.809
What do we do now?

1142
01:13:07.818 --> 01:13:10.228
Fuck, yeah, man. Come on.

1143
01:13:10.237 --> 01:13:11.813
It's a fucking dead end.

1144
01:13:11.863 --> 01:13:13.815
I thought you had a way out?

1145
01:13:13.824 --> 01:13:17.451
I didn't say anything about a way out.
I promised you we'd get in. We're in.


1146
01:13:17.452 --> 01:13:18.661
I have an idea.

1147
01:13:18.662 --> 01:13:19.954
What? Where are you going?

1148
01:13:19.955 --> 01:13:21.372
Follow me.

1149
01:13:21.373 --> 01:13:23.366
Follow you?

1150
01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:27.920
What are you doing?

1151
01:13:27.921 --> 01:13:29.338
Making a bomb!

1152
01:13:29.339 --> 01:13:30.589
I've got you, Wikus.

1153
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:31.590
Let's go!

1154
01:13:31.591 --> 01:13:33.251
It's a dead end.

1155
01:13:44.479 --> 01:13:46.848
Come on. Get in.

1156
01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:50.018
Go! Drive!

1157
01:13:51.153 --> 01:13:52.604
Okay.

1158
01:13:54.990 --> 01:13:56.483
Okay, hold on.

1159
01:14:05.667 --> 01:14:09.871
<i>Reports are coming in of an explosion
in downtown Johannesburg.</i>


1160
01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.917
Well, there was a terrorist attack,
but I can assure you we've dealt with it.


1161
01:14:17.637 --> 01:14:22.217
Drop it now. We drop it now.
The cunt!


1162
01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:31.309
They're really pissed at us now.

1163
01:14:35.947 --> 01:14:37.565
Shit.

1164
01:14:41.953 --> 01:14:44.239
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1165
01:14:45.749 --> 01:14:48.535
Don't drop that fucking thing.

1166
01:14:57.344 --> 01:14:59.921
Come on, come on, come on. Move.
Get down there.


1167
01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:03.091
Go down and initiate
the binary commands.


1168
01:15:05.811 --> 01:15:08.263
Set it down right now.

1169
01:15:08.271 --> 01:15:11.107
When we get to the mother ship,
how long is this gonna take?


1170
01:15:11.108 --> 01:15:12.608
To do what?

1171
01:15:12.609 --> 01:15:14.060
The fixing. To fix me.

1172
01:15:14.319 --> 01:15:16.487
It's going to take
a bit longer than I thought.


1173
01:15:16.488 --> 01:15:19.399
Okay. All right. That's fine.
How long do you need?


1174
01:15:19.449 --> 01:15:21.318
Three years.

1175
01:15:21.326 --> 01:15:23.869
Sorry, wait. Just go slowly
with the clicks there.


1176
01:15:23.870 --> 01:15:27.991
It sounded like you said "three years."
Like human years.


1177
01:15:28.166 --> 01:15:30.577
Yes. Three years.

1178
01:15:30.836 --> 01:15:33.496
What? Three fucking years?

1179
01:15:33.505 --> 01:15:35.714
I will fix you...

1180
01:15:35.715 --> 01:15:40.128
...but first I must save my people.

1181
01:15:40.137 --> 01:15:43.715
The deal was,
you go home, I get fixed.


1182
01:15:43.723 --> 01:15:47.761
I will not let my people
be medical experiments!


1183
01:15:47.769 --> 01:15:50.396
I'm a fucking medical experiment.
You hear me?


1184
01:15:50.397 --> 01:15:53.274
I'm a fucking
medical experiment, man.


1185
01:15:53.275 --> 01:15:59.606
I must go home and get help. I must
use all the fluid to travel quickly.


1186
01:16:00.282 --> 01:16:04.402
I'll just stay here, Christopher.
I'll just stay here in this shack.


1187
01:16:04.411 --> 01:16:06.370
And I'll see you in three years time?

1188
01:16:06.371 --> 01:16:08.080
I will come back. I promise.

1189
01:16:08.081 --> 01:16:09.908
Hey, Christopher.

1190
01:16:22.804 --> 01:16:27.258
Arriving on the ground. First
Reaction Battalion is in pursuit. Over.


1191
01:16:32.147 --> 01:16:33.848
Where the fuck is he?

1192
01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:37.151
Hey.

1193
01:16:37.152 --> 01:16:39.938
You got Wikus down there, my boy?

1194
01:16:41.114 --> 01:16:42.399
Father!

1195
01:16:42.490 --> 01:16:46.827
No. Your daddy needs to stay there
to sort out a few things, all right?


1196
01:16:46.828 --> 01:16:50.824
But we're gonna go and we're come
back and fetch him. Okay? All right?


1197
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:55.461
In here?

1198
01:16:55.462 --> 01:16:56.462
In there.

1199
01:16:56.463 --> 01:16:57.922
It goes in here, eh?

1200
01:16:57.923 --> 01:17:00.875
How the fuck
do you open this, prawn?


1201
01:17:04.221 --> 01:17:05.547
Father.

1202
01:17:06.181 --> 01:17:08.974
Tell me, you fucker.
You want me to fucking kill you?


1203
01:17:08.975 --> 01:17:13.346
Hey? Is that what you fucking want'?
Hey?


1204
01:17:17.567 --> 01:17:19.060
Hey?

1205
01:17:21.947 --> 01:17:25.567
Okay. Let's see.

1206
01:17:27.702 --> 01:17:29.203
What?

1207
01:17:29.204 --> 01:17:32.122
What? Okay. There's no buttons.

1208
01:17:32.123 --> 01:17:33.825
- On.
- Open it.


1209
01:17:34.668 --> 01:17:37.503
- Activate.
- You have five seconds to tell me.


1210
01:17:37.504 --> 01:17:40.999
One prawn, one bullet.

1211
01:17:46.221 --> 01:17:49.549
I can't believe I
get paid to do this.

1212
01:17:50.892 --> 01:17:54.679
I love watching you prawns die.

1213
01:17:56.356 --> 01:17:58.600
What the fuck, man?

1214
01:17:59.526 --> 01:18:01.769
Oh, fuck.

1215
01:18:03.571 --> 01:18:07.358
All right. Okay. Okay.

1216
01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:10.320
Father!

1217
01:18:13.999 --> 01:18:15.533
Get out! Now!

1218
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:25.092
<i>This is remarkable.</i>

1219
01:18:25.093 --> 01:18:27.845
<i>It looks like something
is emerging from the ground.</i>


1220
01:18:27.846 --> 01:18:30.347
<i>Something is definitely
coming out of the ground.</i>


1221
01:18:30.348 --> 01:18:33.301
All right. All right.
Okay. Okay, steady.


1222
01:18:35.895 --> 01:18:38.056
Fuck it.

1223
01:18:41.568 --> 01:18:45.029
Go sit down. You can't play here now.
Your Uncle Wikus is flying.


1224
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:48.073
Uncle Wikus is flying now, all right?

1225
01:18:48.074 --> 01:18:49.692
Fuck. Fuck off.

1226
01:18:56.916 --> 01:18:59.918
- Hold your track on that target.
<i>- Affirmative, colonel.</i>


1227
01:18:59.919 --> 01:19:01.871
Fire when locked.

1228
01:19:04.758 --> 01:19:08.336
<i>It seems to be drifting
towards the center of the territory.</i>


1229
01:19:08.345 --> 01:19:10.088
<i>- We have a lock.</i>
- Fire!


1230
01:19:12.015 --> 01:19:14.926
<i>Something has fired upon it.
Yes, it's been hit.</i>


1231
01:19:15.185 --> 01:19:17.011
What the fuck is that?

1232
01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:20.265
<i>One of the engines is
billowing smoke. It's out of control.</i>


1233
01:19:20.607 --> 01:19:25.228
It's going down, boss. Should I
send the boys to fuck him up?


1234
01:19:28.198 --> 01:19:32.034
<i>...now, and... And it's hit the ground.
A massive impact.</i>


1235
01:19:32.035 --> 01:19:33.987
<i>And it's come to a standstill.</i>

1236
01:19:40.043 --> 01:19:41.327
My Son!

1237
01:19:42.379 --> 01:19:43.587
My son's in there!

1238
01:19:43.588 --> 01:19:47.591
Shut the fuck up! Get this fuck inside.
We're moving out. Come, let's go!


1239
01:19:47.592 --> 01:19:52.297
- Move him out. That's it.
- Move!


1240
01:19:52.305 --> 01:19:54.973
<i>We're banking around,
trying to get a better view...</i>


1241
01:19:54.974 --> 01:19:56.767
<i>...of the ship, which is wrecked.</i>

1242
01:19:56.768 --> 01:19:58.803
<i>Waiting for some
of the smoke to clear.</i>


1243
01:21:02.375 --> 01:21:04.710
<i>Somebody has been pulled out
of the vehicle.</i>


1244
01:21:04.711 --> 01:21:06.587
<i>It looks like a human being.</i>

1245
01:21:06.588 --> 01:21:09.590
<i>We are getting unconfirmed reports
that this might be...</i>


1246
01:21:09.591 --> 01:21:12.676
<i>...Wikus van de Merwe,
a fugitive that has been on the run...</i>


1247
01:21:12.677 --> 01:21:15.171
<i>...from Multi-National United
for the past week.</i>


1248
01:21:15.180 --> 01:21:19.926
<i>They're loading him into
a vehicle now and heading off.</i>


1249

<i>Battalion One to Control, confirming
prisoners are secured and traveling.</i>


1250
01:21:28.067 --> 01:21:31.646
<i>Expect delivery by 1600 hours.</i>

1251
01:21:46.419 --> 01:21:48.371
What the fuck?

1252
01:21:49.797 --> 01:21:51.666
Back up.

1253
01:21:57.388 --> 01:21:59.090
Watch out. Watch out.

1254
01:22:01.809 --> 01:22:03.344
We found him, boss.

1255
01:22:03.645 --> 01:22:04.887
Bring him to me.

1256
01:22:14.864 --> 01:22:16.816
Get up. Move! Move!

1257
01:22:21.704 --> 01:22:24.574
- Take cover. Fall back.
- We need to regroup.


1258
01:22:25.792 --> 01:22:27.034
What the fuck?

1259
01:22:33.091 --> 01:22:34.967
Control, we're taking enemy fire.

1260
01:22:34.968 --> 01:22:37.754
We need support.
Backup. Backup now!


1261
01:22:42.892 --> 01:22:45.261
Fuck off! No, fuck off, man!

1262
01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:57.982
Get your hands off me.
Fucking get off me!


1263
01:23:01.786 --> 01:23:05.782
Get your fucking hands off me!
I'll fucking kill you.


1264
01:23:42.577 --> 01:23:44.620
Didn't I tell you...

1265
01:23:44.621 --> 01:23:46.038
...that I'm going to get you?

1266
01:23:46.039 --> 01:23:49.617
You came that day and left
with something that belongs to me.


1267
01:23:51.419 --> 01:23:52.995
Fuck you.

1268
01:24:00.928 --> 01:24:05.591
Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you!

1269
01:24:14.817 --> 01:24:16.686
Go, go, go!

1270
01:24:18.112 --> 01:24:19.981
<i>Arriving at location. Over.</i>

1271
01:24:26.037 --> 01:24:29.782
Additional troops
are moving into place.


1272
01:24:30.375 --> 01:24:32.535
Go, go, go!

1273
01:24:32.919 --> 01:24:34.912
Kill them! Kill all of them!

1274
01:24:37.256 --> 01:24:38.507
Move it.

1275
01:24:38.508 --> 01:24:41.168
- Koobus!
- Cover the eastern block.


1276
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:43.796
I told you...

1277
01:24:44.180 --> 01:24:46.048
...that the day would come.

1278
01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:49.302
You've been running around
with my prize.


1279
01:24:50.103 --> 01:24:54.106
All I want is to eat that arm
and become like you.


1280
01:24:54.107 --> 01:24:56.225
No, no, no. It won't work.

1281
01:24:58.528 --> 01:25:00.313
- Go, go, go.
- Move it.


1282
01:25:00.321 --> 01:25:02.231
Once I have that power...

1283
01:25:02.407 --> 01:25:04.025
...no one will stop me.

1284
01:25:04.033 --> 01:25:05.443
It was your turn...

1285
01:25:06.452 --> 01:25:07.695

<i>With MNU security forces,

1288
01:26:08.431 --> 01:26:10.383
Let's cut here.

1289
01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:29.068
Fuck.

1290
01:26:36.918 --> 01:26:38.327
Fuck.

- Yeah.


1294

- See that prawn in the Casspir?
- Yeah.


1295
01:27:53.953 --> 01:27:56.447
He knows what the fuck
is up with that ship.


1296
01:27:56.455 --> 01:27:59.325
Get the fucker out
and get him talking now.


1297
01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:03.621
- Kronier.
- Cover.

you fucking alien. Come here.


1300

What's your plan, huh?
What's your plan?


1301
01:28:38.831 --> 01:28:40.116
Move, move, move.

1302
01:28:57.808 --> 01:29:00.052
How are you doing that?

1303

Who's moving that ship?

1304
01:29:04.523 --> 01:29:07.609
All right. That's very comfort...

1305

Fucking <i>bliksem.</i>

1306

Wait for my command.
Make sure you fucking shoot to kill.


1307

Move it, move it.

1309

Take the right flanks.
Take that fucker down.

Hold your fire.
Hold your fire and keep your positions.

Get down, get down.

Okay, go, go, go.

No, we can make it. I think the ship's
stopping. We can make it. Come on.

Come on. Come on. Come on.

Listen, you go ahead.
You can make it.


1348

No, we stick together.
I'm not leaving you here.

Don't make me go through this

01:34:05.157 --> 01:34:06.525
Big fucking men.

1358
01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:28.297
Come on! Bring what you got!

1359
01:34:29.306 --> 01:34:31.300
Come on!

1360
01:34:53.455 --> 01:34:55.365
You want me? You want me?

1361
01:35:00.587 --> 01:35:01.914
Is that all you've got?

1362
01:35:04.258 --> 01:35:06.376
Is that all you've fucking got?

1363
01:35:09.596 --> 01:35:12.974
<i>Some sort of quite extraordinary light
from the mother ship.</i>


1364
01:35:12.975 --> 01:35:15.886
<i>I've never seen anything like it.
It's a beam of li...</i>


1365
01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:24.444
Select weapons.
Okay, fuck. Which one?


1366
01:35:24.445 --> 01:35:27.231
No, not that one. Go forward.
Forward scan. Okay.


1367
01:35:30.117 --> 01:35:31.818
Fire.

1368
01:35:59.104 --> 01:36:03.232
<i>Report. Come in.</i>

1369
01:36:03.233 --> 01:36:05.151
Get to the vehicle now. Get going.

1370
01:36:05.152 --> 01:36:06.687
- Yes, colonel.
- Go, go, go.


1371
01:36:16.246 --> 01:36:17.489
Fuck!

1372
01:36:32.012 --> 01:36:33.380
Fuck. Fuck.

1373
01:36:34.098 --> 01:36:37.092
You wanna fucking play with me,
Koobus?


1374
01:36:37.476 --> 01:36:39.803
You fucker!

1375
01:36:57.996 --> 01:36:59.698
He almost got me.

1376
01:37:00.374 --> 01:37:03.827
Go. Come on.

1377
01:38:40.557 --> 01:38:42.926
We go home now?

1378
01:38:43.685 --> 01:38:44.785
Yes.

1379
01:39:10.837 --> 01:39:13.165
Unbelievable.

1380
01:39:13.757 --> 01:39:16.501
Now I know why
everybody wants a piece of you.


1381
01:39:20.055 --> 01:39:22.758
I can't wait for those med boys
to cut you up.


1382
01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.638
But you know what? You're not gonna
waste any more of my time.


1383
01:39:28.647 --> 01:39:31.850
You half-breed piece of shit.

1384
01:39:33.110 --> 01:39:36.730
I'm gonna just fucking
kill you myself.


1385
01:39:44.788 --> 01:39:46.698
Stay back, you fucker.

1386
01:39:47.082 --> 01:39:48.492
Stay back.

1387
01:39:50.085 --> 01:39:52.245
Stay back!

1388
01:41:17.756 --> 01:41:20.675
<i>And people everywhere
across Johannesburg...</i>


1389
01:41:20.676 --> 01:41:24.261
<i>...are flooding the streets,
are pouring out of their offices.</i>


1390
01:41:24.262 --> 01:41:28.599
<i>And all eyes are pointing up towards
the sky on this momentous day.</i>


1391
01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:33.062
<i>It's the first time, ladies and
gentlemen, in over two decades...</i>


1392
01:41:33.063 --> 01:41:35.690
<i>...that the mother ship has shown
any movement...</i>


1393
01:41:35.691 --> 01:41:37.733
<i>...and people are
tremendously excited.</i>


1394
01:41:37.734 --> 01:41:40.945
<i>The city has come
to an absolute standstill.</i>


1395
01:41:40.946 --> 01:41:45.658
<i>And everybody wants to know
what's going to happen next.</i>


1396
01:41:45.659 --> 01:41:48.994
<i>There's no way of knowing whether
Christopher Johnson will return.</i>


1397
01:41:48.995 --> 01:41:53.950
We don't know if he was escaping,
whether he will effect a rescue plan...


1398
01:41:56.044 --> 01:41:58.421
...and as the so-called
free press says...


1399
01:41:58.422 --> 01:42:01.958
...whether or not he'll come back
and declare war on us.


1400
01:42:26.825 --> 01:42:31.287
<i>This is the last known footage
of Wikus van de Merwe.</i>


1401
01:42:31.288 --> 01:42:36.368
<i>And we can only speculate
as to what has happened to him.</i>


1402
01:42:36.376 --> 01:42:40.671
The more zany conspiracy theories
state that...


1403
01:42:40.672 --> 01:42:45.176
...he's been captured by MNU
or by another government.


1404
01:42:45.177 --> 01:42:47.636
Or by perhaps some
shady government agency...


1405
01:42:47.637 --> 01:42:50.590
...and is actually being held
in captivity.


1406
01:42:50.599 --> 01:42:53.017
If we knew where he was,
we would help him.


1407
01:42:53.018 --> 01:42:56.846
And that is the most difficult part,
just not knowing where he is.


1408
01:42:56.855 --> 01:42:58.898
Wikus, sadly, is gone...

1409
01:42:58.899 --> 01:43:03.903
...but I'm the one who stays behind
with all the questions.


1410
01:43:03.904 --> 01:43:05.397
I can't give the answers.

1411
01:43:05.739 --> 01:43:09.109
He died in my
mind a long time ago.

1412
01:43:09.326 --> 01:43:10.568
And that's that.

1413
01:43:10.577 --> 01:43:14.413
Wikus van de Merwe is a name
that will become very widely known...


1414
01:43:14.414 --> 01:43:18.368
...because of this pivotal role
that he played in this whole event.


1415
01:43:18.376 --> 01:43:21.663
<i>He was an honest man and he
didn't deserve what happened.</i>


1416
01:43:21.671 --> 01:43:25.583
<i>I know. I looked into
the computer system and I found stuff.</i>


1417
01:43:25.592 --> 01:43:29.178
I mean, the whole data was there,
you know?


1418
01:43:29.179 --> 01:43:31.673
They didn't even do a good job
of hiding it.


1419
01:43:49.908 --> 01:43:53.611
You guys haven't seen my wife.
Let me show you my wife.


1420
01:43:53.954 --> 01:43:55.830
She's my special angel.

1421
01:43:55.831 --> 01:43:59.083
She even looks like a angel
with a halo. You want to see?


1422
01:43:59.084 --> 01:44:03.671
With the white veil over the head,
she even looks like an angel.


1423
01:44:03.672 --> 01:44:07.675
Everyone says his wife's an angel, but
this is a real angel that you're seeing.


1424
01:44:07.676 --> 01:44:10.962
On the cameras. They won't put that
in the video, I don't think.


1425
01:44:17.435 --> 01:44:22.891
I found this at my front door, as though
somebody had just left it there.


1426
01:44:24.484 --> 01:44:28.605
My friends say I should throw it away
because it's just a piece of rubbish.


1427
01:44:30.156 --> 01:44:33.318
And it couldn't possibly
come from him.


1428
01:44:34.119 --> 01:44:36.529
I know it's true.
