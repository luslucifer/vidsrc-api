00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.346
<i>- Sorry.
- It's OK.</i>


2
00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:02.136
<i>Well... what do you want to know?</i>

3
00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.346
<i>Um.. oh, just a sec,
it hasn't recorded.</i>


4
00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:10.730
<i>There.</i>

5
00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:15.536
<i>So, the way you describe
the son's accident...</i>


6
00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:19.016
<i>It's troubling to read
because we know it's your life.</i>


7
00:01:19.186 --> 00:01:21.596
<i>Do you think one can only
write from experience?</i>


8
00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:31.636
<i>Come. Jump!</i>

9
00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:33.886
<i>Jump!</i>

10
00:01:34.346 --> 00:01:36.056
Jump. C'mon!

11
00:01:37.916 --> 00:01:39.586
Jump! Jump!

12
00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:43.266
...and it leads me
to an interesting story,


13
00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:46.361
and I decide to put you in the book
that I'm writing. And that's it.


14
00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:48.279
It's not more. 
You're in my book.

15
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:50.615
And yet, I don't know you.

16
00:01:51.436 --> 00:01:53.951
<i>What I do know about is my
interest in you and that is for..</i>


17
00:01:53.976 --> 00:01:56.436
Yeah, but still, you
had to meet me first.

18
00:01:56.846 --> 00:01:59.476
I'm real, in front of you now.

19
00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.556
<i>Yes, that you are.</i>

20
00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:04.241
Yeah, so, for you to start inventing,

21
00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:06.096
you need something real first.

22
00:02:06.306 --> 00:02:08.568
<i>You say your books
always mix truth and fiction</i>


23
00:02:08.593 --> 00:02:11.229
<i>and that makes us want
to figure out which is which.</i>


24
00:02:11.253 --> 00:02:11.991
What?

25
00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:13.306
<i>Is that your goal?</i>

26
00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:14.722
What's it?

27
00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:19.596
OK, get out.

28
00:02:24.006 --> 00:02:25.166
<i>Snoop, come!</i>

29
00:02:26.051 --> 00:02:29.056
<i>Let's dry you off.
You're nice and clean.</i>


30
00:02:29.226 --> 00:02:30.476
<i>No more dirt.</i>

31
00:02:36.947 --> 00:02:38.846
<i>What would you write about?</i>

32
00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:41.759
It's Samuel working upstairs.
My husband.


33
00:02:45.056 --> 00:02:47.571
So, what interests you?

34
00:02:47.596 --> 00:02:49.936
What makes you so mad
you want to explode?


35
00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.150
Forget about your thesis,
your studies.


36
00:02:52.175 --> 00:02:53.564
I don't want to be a writer.

37
00:02:54.275 --> 00:02:57.976
<i>That's OK, you don't have to write,
just talk, like we're talking now.</i>


38
00:02:58.151 --> 00:02:59.876
You don't want to go on
with my questions?


39
00:02:59.901 --> 00:03:03.976
<i>Of course, I want to go on vacation.
Of course... but we could chat too.</i>


40
00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:06.516
Maybe we ask one question each,

41
00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:10.436
so nobody's frustrated,
like a normal conversation.


42
00:03:11.636 --> 00:03:13.261
Are you really interested
in what I...


43
00:03:13.286 --> 00:03:16.266
What interests you?
Come on, sure.


44
00:03:16.936 --> 00:03:19.356
I never see anybody,
I work here all day long.


45
00:03:19.456 --> 00:03:21.516
You come to see me,
of course you interest me.


46
00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:25.761
Okay, uh...

47
00:03:25.786 --> 00:03:26.876
I run.

48
00:03:27.336 --> 00:03:29.706
It's one of my favorite things to do.

49
00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.126
Makes me feel high,
like I'm on drugs.


50
00:03:33.496 --> 00:03:35.792
- What do you know about drugs, then?
- Oh, a lot.


51
00:03:35.817 --> 00:03:37.766
That's the next question.

52
00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:39.496
Big subject.

53
00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:42.228
<i>Maybe you don't write everything down.</i>

54
00:03:42.253 --> 00:03:44.126
No. No, surely not.

55
00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:56.536
I told you,
we should have done this in Grenoble.


56
00:03:57.206 --> 00:03:59.836
<i>It's fine.
I'll write your answers down.</i>


57
00:04:00.036 --> 00:04:03.836
But I have many, many questions.
Maybe you don't have the time.


58
00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:08.311
Oh, don't worry about time,
time is not the problem here.


59
00:04:08.336 --> 00:04:09.336
OK. Cool.

60
00:04:09.456 --> 00:04:11.961
I'd like to discuss storytelling
as an investiga...


61
00:04:11.994 --> 00:04:13.414
I don't like sports.

62
00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.626
That's the first thing.

63
00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:17.786
Walking yes, maybe.
Running, no!


64
00:04:18.456 --> 00:04:20.126
OK, right, I get it.

65
00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:22.126
So,

66
00:04:23.086 --> 00:04:24.246
<i>you're...</i>

67
00:04:33.286 --> 00:04:35.416
It's not really possible anymore,
is it?


68
00:04:35.586 --> 00:04:36.996
<i>Yes, it's complicated.</i>

69
00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:39.246
I think we have to stop, Zoé.

70
00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.416
You know what,
I'll be in Grenoble soon.


71
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:46.150
I'll give you a call.
How about that?


72
00:04:46.175 --> 00:04:47.222
Okay.

73
00:04:53.036 --> 00:04:54.416
Sorry about that.

74
00:04:57.306 --> 00:04:58.511
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.


75
00:04:58.536 --> 00:05:00.416
- See you soon.
- Yeah. Definitively, I will.


76
00:06:54.456 --> 00:06:55.586
Careful.

77
00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:34.536
Dad...

78
00:07:34.586 --> 00:07:35.626
Mom!

79
00:07:36.166 --> 00:07:37.626
<i>Mom!</i>

80
00:07:38.947 --> 00:07:39.955
Mom!

81
00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:41.893
Mom!

82
00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:43.626
Mom, come quick!

83
00:08:24.893 --> 00:08:25.806
I don't know...

84
00:08:29.336 --> 00:08:30.761
<i>Yes...</i>

85
00:08:30.786 --> 00:08:32.311
<i>No, he's...
I don't know.</i>


86
00:08:32.336 --> 00:08:35.036
<i>I didn't move him,
I didn't touch him at all.</i>


87
00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:38.166
<i>He's not breathing,
that's why I'm calling.</i>


88
00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:42.811
<i>No, please come,
I can't answer all the questions.</i>


89
00:08:43.444 --> 00:08:44.452
<i>No.</i>

90
00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:49.126
<i>No, he's not moving.
Please just come.</i>


91
00:08:58.336 --> 00:08:59.956
<i>Samuel Maleski,</i>

92
00:09:00.126 --> 00:09:02.376
<i>found dead below his chalet...</i>

93
00:09:34.836 --> 00:09:36.416
<i>Turning him now.</i>

94
00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.246
<i>Full shot.</i>

95
00:09:42.376 --> 00:09:43.666
<i>Close up.</i>

96
00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:51.086
<i>I'll dictate the initial ideas.
Insert them before the conclusion.</i>


97
00:09:51.416 --> 00:09:55.246
The parallel, superficial abrasions
on the hands and forearms


98
00:09:55.416 --> 00:09:58.286
suggest the body slid

99
00:09:58.496 --> 00:10:01.536
<i>before reaching
its final, supine position.</i>


100
00:10:02.376 --> 00:10:05.996
<i>A left temporal hematoma
related to the fatal brain trauma</i>


101
00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:09.916
<i>indicates collision with
a blunt object in the environment</i>


102
00:10:10.136 --> 00:10:12.516
<i>or a violent blow to the head.</i>

103
00:10:13.536 --> 00:10:16.996
<i>Injury location is inconsistent
with discovery position,</i>


104
00:10:17.166 --> 00:10:20.836
<i>thus impact occurred
before the body hit the ground.</i>


105
00:10:22.626 --> 00:10:24.746
<i>In conclusion,
we cannot yet determine</i>


106
00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:28.286
<i>if the injury resulted
from a collision or a blow.</i>


107
00:10:28.626 --> 00:10:32.996
<i>We cannot, at this stage,
rule out third party involvement.</i>


108
00:10:35.086 --> 00:10:36.876
<i>Then, the usual.</i>

109
00:10:37.246 --> 00:10:39.431
<i>CAUSE OF DEATH: Head Trauma.</i>

110
00:10:39.456 --> 00:10:43.956
<i>FORENSIC CAUSE:
Accidental and/or Deliberate.</i>


111
00:10:44.186 --> 00:10:48.516
<i>Toxicological analysis needed
to establish the truth.</i>


112
00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:58.336
Anatomy of A Fall.

113
00:12:40.286 --> 00:12:42.590
- Thank you for coming.
- Yeah.


114
00:12:43.166 --> 00:12:45.206
It's really weird,
seeing you again like this.


115
00:12:45.376 --> 00:12:46.456
- It is.
- OK.


116
00:12:49.086 --> 00:12:52.036
I didn't realize it was so high.

117
00:12:52.536 --> 00:12:53.916
Yeah.

118
00:12:54.666 --> 00:12:55.836
Come.

119
00:13:00.246 --> 00:13:02.666
Have you lived here long?

120
00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:05.666
Less than two years.

121
00:13:06.042 --> 00:13:08.605
As for Samuel,
he grew up here.


122
00:13:08.916 --> 00:13:10.166
It's his...

123
00:13:16.206 --> 00:13:17.456
Well...

124
00:13:21.055 --> 00:13:26.286
How are we gonna do this?
Will you ask me some questions and...


125
00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:29.784
I'm really sorry that my French
isn't any better than when we met.


126
00:13:29.809 --> 00:13:31.956
- No. English is fine.
- OK.


127
00:13:36.286 --> 00:13:38.286
How many times
have you been questioned?


128
00:13:38.956 --> 00:13:42.036
It's been once here,
by the policemen


129
00:13:42.206 --> 00:13:44.746
and once
by the investigative judge.


130
00:13:46.416 --> 00:13:50.656
<i>Can you tell me what you told them
about the day he died?</i>


131
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:51.736
Yes, of course.

132
00:13:51.767 --> 00:13:54.806
<i>I told them everything,
from when I was with the student</i>


133
00:13:54.956 --> 00:13:56.956
<i>until the ambulance got here.</i>

134
00:13:57.286 --> 00:13:59.746
<i>I was in the middle of a meeting
with this girl,</i>


135
00:13:59.916 --> 00:14:02.416
<i>and Samuel started</i>

136
00:14:02.636 --> 00:14:05.886
<i>blasting a song on repeat
to piss me off and make her leave.</i>


137
00:14:06.036 --> 00:14:08.876
Is that what you told them... that he
played the song to piss you off?


138
00:14:09.036 --> 00:14:10.126
<i>No.</i>

139
00:14:10.926 --> 00:14:14.870
I just said that he played the song
super loud and that we had to stop.


140
00:14:14.895 --> 00:14:18.166
because he was recording the interview
and it wasn't possible anymore.


141
00:14:19.586 --> 00:14:22.336
<i>I need you to be precise.</i>

142
00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:26.036
<i>Tell me everything, I mean,
exactly the way you told them.</i>


143
00:14:26.206 --> 00:14:27.242
Yes.

144
00:14:28.036 --> 00:14:31.586
So. I told them that
I put an end to the interview.


145
00:14:32.586 --> 00:14:33.746
And that she left.

146
00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:36.376
And I went upstairs to my bedroom

147
00:14:36.536 --> 00:14:39.586
and that's when I saw Daniel
go out for a walk.


148
00:14:39.806 --> 00:14:41.386
He wasn't at school, Daniel?

149
00:14:41.536 --> 00:14:43.996
<i>No, he only goes
two days a week in Grenoble.</i>


150
00:14:44.376 --> 00:14:45.626
How old is he now?

151
00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:47.086
<i>He's eleven.</i>

152
00:14:48.456 --> 00:14:49.996
And then...

153
00:14:50.666 --> 00:14:52.916
So, after the girl left...

154
00:14:54.996 --> 00:14:57.086
Samuel came down
to see me in my bedroom


155
00:14:57.246 --> 00:15:00.416
and we spoke a litle bit about
what we were going to do that day.


156
00:15:00.586 --> 00:15:02.226
It was nothing special, really.

157
00:15:02.274 --> 00:15:03.352
And...

158
00:15:05.126 --> 00:15:06.286
He...

159
00:15:06.456 --> 00:15:10.086
He went back upstairs to work
in the attic and I worked a little in bed.


160
00:15:10.836 --> 00:15:13.206
<i>You wrote? On your computer?</i>

161
00:15:13.376 --> 00:15:15.416
Yes, I finished a translation.

162
00:15:15.586 --> 00:15:18.786
I translate for several German weeklies.
Its for extra money.


163
00:15:19.996 --> 00:15:21.126
And...

164
00:15:22.086 --> 00:15:25.626
Yeah. I heard him working upstairs
and playing his music


165
00:15:25.786 --> 00:15:28.416
for about, I think it must've been

166
00:15:28.586 --> 00:15:29.746
ten minutes.

167
00:15:30.126 --> 00:15:33.456
And then I put some earplugs in
because I wanted to take a nap.


168
00:15:34.836 --> 00:15:35.996
And..

169
00:15:36.626 --> 00:15:37.996
I fell asleep.

170
00:15:40.416 --> 00:15:42.416
And an hour later, I think,

171
00:15:42.786 --> 00:15:45.126
I heard Daniel scream and...

172
00:15:48.876 --> 00:15:52.456
One of the earpluga must've fallen out,
I guess, because it woke me up and...


173
00:15:53.206 --> 00:15:56.336
The music was still on and
I ran downstairs and...


174
00:15:56.916 --> 00:15:58.036
Yeah. That's it.

175
00:15:59.286 --> 00:16:02.036
I called the SAMU
and they arrived 30 minutes later.


176
00:16:03.075 --> 00:16:04.083
Okay.

177
00:16:12.496 --> 00:16:14.761
- Can I take a look around?
- Of course.


178
00:16:14.831 --> 00:16:16.416
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


179
00:16:21.036 --> 00:16:25.036
Where do you want to start?
Should I explain... something?


180
00:16:25.206 --> 00:16:26.376
Yeah, maybe.

181
00:16:26.876 --> 00:16:28.336
Yeah. This is where...

182
00:16:28.496 --> 00:16:30.086
This is where we eat.

183
00:16:30.246 --> 00:16:31.956
- Yeah, sorry...
- No...


184
00:16:56.246 --> 00:16:57.246
So...

185
00:16:58.166 --> 00:16:59.376
He was working over there?

186
00:16:59.536 --> 00:17:01.496
Yeah, he was insulating the attic.

187
00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:06.126
And when you were having a nap,
he was right above you?


188
00:17:06.286 --> 00:17:08.395
- Yes.
- OK.


189
00:17:17.746 --> 00:17:19.206
So...

190
00:17:19.376 --> 00:17:21.376
He was supposed to get to that next.

191
00:17:21.536 --> 00:17:23.786
We wanted to make rooms for B&B.

192
00:18:04.086 --> 00:18:06.166
So, he was working there?

193
00:18:06.336 --> 00:18:07.626
<i>These days, yes.</i>

194
00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:12.641
And the window,

195
00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:15.166
do you remember, when the
ambulance arrived, was it open?


196
00:18:15.376 --> 00:18:16.746
Yes, it was.

197
00:18:18.536 --> 00:18:20.536
<i>He used to keep it open?</i>

198
00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:23.666
I'm not sure of that really, because

199
00:18:23.836 --> 00:18:25.641
sometimes he would air
the room, you know,


200
00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:27.706
because he wanted to get rid
of the wood dust and...


201
00:18:27.916 --> 00:18:31.286
Was he reckless? Did he ever
take risks while he was working?


202
00:18:31.626 --> 00:18:35.536
No, he was very cautious and
meticulous. He worked slowly.


203
00:18:44.626 --> 00:18:46.536
<i>Is there any reason why he would've</i>

204
00:18:46.766 --> 00:18:49.716
leaned out the window,
for instance, to call out to you


205
00:18:49.741 --> 00:18:50.779
<i>or Daniel?</i>

206
00:18:50.811 --> 00:18:55.786
No, when he was working, especially when
he was playing his music, he kind of...


207
00:18:57.376 --> 00:18:59.626
he shut himself off from
the rest of world.


208
00:18:59.786 --> 00:19:02.336
So, he never called
for me or Daniel up here.


209
00:19:03.565 --> 00:19:06.376
Anyway, with the height of the...

210
00:19:08.378 --> 00:19:09.441
Windowsill?

211
00:19:09.519 --> 00:19:10.846
- Windowsill.
- Yeah.


212
00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:15.166
Had he been drinking?

213
00:19:15.336 --> 00:19:16.626
No, never drinked
during the day.


214
00:19:16.856 --> 00:19:18.856
Especially when he was working.

215
00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:29.086
<i>Sweetie...</i>

216
00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:33.456
Come wash up and get dressed.
It's daytime, you need to get up.


217
00:19:35.956 --> 00:19:38.626
Honey, I know this is hard.
It's hard for me too.


218
00:19:39.036 --> 00:19:41.246
And it's going to be hard
for a while.


219
00:19:42.586 --> 00:19:46.586
But we have to try and do the things
that we did before because...


220
00:19:50.996 --> 00:19:54.036
Look, Monica came to see you,
she made you Tiramisu. Huh?


221
00:19:56.996 --> 00:19:59.206
You can't spend whole days
like this without going outside.


222
00:19:59.376 --> 00:20:02.246
It's beautiful out.
And Snoop needs to go out too.


223
00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:12.956
Daniel,
will you come eat with us?


224
00:20:13.496 --> 00:20:14.666
<i>I want to sleep.</i>

225
00:20:14.836 --> 00:20:18.416
OK, first eat with us,
then you can sleep.


226
00:20:53.376 --> 00:20:54.876
<i>I don't understand.</i>

227
00:20:56.166 --> 00:20:58.286
<i>No one understands.</i>

228
00:20:58.456 --> 00:21:00.036
<i>We can't understand.</i>

229
00:21:04.996 --> 00:21:06.496
I have to understand.

230
00:21:12.666 --> 00:21:16.086
Remember the psychic
I told you about,


231
00:21:16.246 --> 00:21:18.416
the one I saw when Alain died?

232
00:21:19.586 --> 00:21:20.996
Monica.

233
00:21:21.166 --> 00:21:22.166
<i>I'd like to.</i>

234
00:21:22.246 --> 00:21:24.086
I'd rather you don't...

235
00:21:24.246 --> 00:21:26.246
He helped me a lot.

236
00:21:26.456 --> 00:21:27.746
But he's a child.

237
00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:29.286
Don't confuse things.

238
00:21:29.456 --> 00:21:30.916
I'll discuss it with Monica.

239
00:21:31.086 --> 00:21:33.126
<i>She's helped children before.</i>

240
00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:37.336
Want some?

241
00:21:47.336 --> 00:21:48.956
What do you need?

242
00:21:49.586 --> 00:21:50.956
<i>Nothing, I'm OK.</i>

243
00:21:51.126 --> 00:21:52.336
OK.

244
00:22:01.706 --> 00:22:04.536
<i>Your doubts aside, it might help him.</i>

245
00:22:04.706 --> 00:22:07.586
<i>She senses things we can't.</i>

246
00:22:09.336 --> 00:22:10.916
Vincent, an old lawyer friend,

247
00:22:11.086 --> 00:22:13.246
Monica, Daniel's Godmother.

248
00:22:13.416 --> 00:22:14.876
- Hello.
- Hello.


249
00:22:15.036 --> 00:22:17.416
- I'll call you.
- Tell me if he eats.


250
00:22:17.626 --> 00:22:18.626
Yes.

251
00:22:22.786 --> 00:22:24.520
- The plates?
- There.


252
00:22:35.786 --> 00:22:37.626
I'm so tired of crying.

253
00:22:37.786 --> 00:22:39.996
It's really ridiculous,
I'm so exhausted.


254
00:22:41.416 --> 00:22:43.336
- You want Parmesan?
- Yes, it's perfect.


255
00:22:43.496 --> 00:22:46.626
- I don't know where the pepper is.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.


256
00:22:49.456 --> 00:22:52.496
So, as you know,
the autopsy report is inconclusive


257
00:22:52.666 --> 00:22:54.206
about the cause of death.

258
00:22:54.586 --> 00:22:58.376
The forensic pathologist
didn't have enough concrete elements.


259
00:22:58.536 --> 00:22:59.706
But...

260
00:23:01.286 --> 00:23:03.417
What we can defend is...

261
00:23:03.442 --> 00:23:07.016
a fall from the attic window,
with him...


262
00:23:07.996 --> 00:23:10.246
bouncing off the shed roof.

263
00:23:10.476 --> 00:23:13.386
His head may have hit the edge
somewhere around here.


264
00:23:16.036 --> 00:23:17.086
<i>You see?</i>

265
00:23:18.086 --> 00:23:20.336
<i>Then he would have landed
on the ground,</i>


266
00:23:20.496 --> 00:23:21.916
<i>approximately here.</i>

267
00:23:22.336 --> 00:23:26.166
<i>It seems that he found the strength
to crawl one meter or two</i>


268
00:23:26.336 --> 00:23:29.786
<i>before collapsing
in this final position.</i>


269
00:23:29.956 --> 00:23:32.706
<i>That explains
the blood on the snow.</i>


270
00:23:33.456 --> 00:23:34.836
But there are several problems.

271
00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:38.086
First, they found nothing
on the roof, no DNA.


272
00:23:38.646 --> 00:23:42.476
And there's these 3 blood spatters
here on the wall.


273
00:23:43.336 --> 00:23:47.206
It seems it doesn't really match
with the head impact on the roof.


274
00:23:47.766 --> 00:23:50.886
The judge has asked an expert
to clarify this.


275
00:23:51.786 --> 00:23:54.536
When you see this
what do you think?


276
00:23:56.876 --> 00:24:00.416
I don't know,
I'm not a spatter analyst.


277
00:24:01.126 --> 00:24:04.336
But I know a very good one.

278
00:24:04.916 --> 00:24:06.496
So, I'm gonna get her opinion.

279
00:24:19.706 --> 00:24:21.996
There's one last problem for us,

280
00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:23.626
that bruise on your arm.

281
00:24:25.246 --> 00:24:28.876
It might look like
the result of a fight or struggle.


282
00:24:31.036 --> 00:24:32.246
When did they see it?

283
00:24:32.396 --> 00:24:34.996
They examined me that same
night, my sleeve was rolled up


284
00:24:35.021 --> 00:24:36.035
and they saw it.

285
00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.996
You explained it to them right away?

286
00:24:38.166 --> 00:24:39.916
I knew how it happened.
Shall I show you?


287
00:24:40.086 --> 00:24:41.376
Yeah, please.

288
00:24:42.336 --> 00:24:45.496
So, when I'm here in the kitchen,
I bang my arm on this all the time.


289
00:24:45.836 --> 00:24:47.336
Like, when I move.

290
00:24:47.836 --> 00:24:51.376
It's ridiculous, it happened
several times that week.


291
00:24:51.536 --> 00:24:53.891
I told them my skin marks easily

292
00:24:53.916 --> 00:24:57.033
and they can ask Daniel because
He hears me bumping into it all the time.


293
00:24:57.206 --> 00:24:58.496
OK. Good.

294
00:25:02.746 --> 00:25:06.376
So, as you can see, an accidental
fall is gonna be hard to defend,


295
00:25:06.536 --> 00:25:09.706
given the height of the windowsill.

296
00:25:10.036 --> 00:25:13.086
So that's why
there's an investigation for...


297
00:25:13.626 --> 00:25:14.956
more suspects.

298
00:25:15.666 --> 00:25:16.956
And you're...

299
00:25:17.126 --> 00:25:19.086
more "Suspicious death".

300
00:25:19.306 --> 00:25:22.136
<i>You're an assisted witness because
you were the only person there.</i>


301
00:25:22.286 --> 00:25:23.416
OK.

302
00:25:23.746 --> 00:25:25.536
<i>And of course, you're his wife.</i>

303
00:25:27.376 --> 00:25:29.678
<i>Now, looking for
a stranger who walks in,</i>


304
00:25:29.703 --> 00:25:32.232
<i>kills him while you were
sleeping right above</i>


305
00:25:32.257 --> 00:25:35.456
<i>and Daniel was out for
a walk is a shitty strategy.</i>


306
00:25:35.626 --> 00:25:37.286
<i>Samuel had no enemies.</i>

307
00:25:37.456 --> 00:25:38.706
Stop!

308
00:25:39.086 --> 00:25:40.496
I did not kill him.

309
00:25:44.746 --> 00:25:46.246
That's not the point.

310
00:25:46.876 --> 00:25:48.036
Really.

311
00:25:50.586 --> 00:25:54.086
We have to go through
Samuel's personality.


312
00:25:54.746 --> 00:25:56.166
What was he going through lately?

313
00:25:58.166 --> 00:26:01.666
Is there anything that would
seem consistent with...


314
00:26:01.836 --> 00:26:02.956
suicide?

315
00:26:09.126 --> 00:26:10.666
I thought about it, obviously,

316
00:26:10.836 --> 00:26:13.746
but I just can't imagine him jumping
with Daniel so close by.


317
00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:16.916
I just can't get it in my head.

318
00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:22.876
Yeah, but it's probably
our best defense.


319
00:26:23.036 --> 00:26:25.206
I mean, if they indict you,

320
00:26:25.836 --> 00:26:27.246
it's our only defense.

321
00:26:28.246 --> 00:26:29.996
But I think he fell.

322
00:26:31.786 --> 00:26:33.626
Nobody's going to believe that.

323
00:26:35.286 --> 00:26:36.786
I don't believe that.

324
00:26:39.496 --> 00:26:40.876
I need a smoke.

325
00:27:10.286 --> 00:27:11.336
<i>Vincent.</i>

326
00:27:12.086 --> 00:27:14.836
<i>There's something
I want to tell you.</i>


327
00:27:16.416 --> 00:27:18.086
About six months ago,

328
00:27:18.876 --> 00:27:20.746
I wonder if...

329
00:27:21.126 --> 00:27:23.706
Samuel didn't swallow some pills.

330
00:27:24.086 --> 00:27:26.715
I found him passed out drunk
on the floor.


331
00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.556
<i>He'd vomited.
It was very early in the morning.</i>


332
00:27:30.456 --> 00:27:32.456
<i>There were some white spots</i>

333
00:27:32.686 --> 00:27:33.686
in the vomit,

334
00:27:33.786 --> 00:27:37.206
and I remember wondering
if they were pills.


335
00:27:39.036 --> 00:27:40.666
- <i>Really?</i>
- Yes.


336
00:27:40.836 --> 00:27:42.836
<i>﻿Did you two talk about it?</i>

337
00:27:42.996 --> 00:27:45.086
No, he didn't want to talk about it.

338
00:27:45.746 --> 00:27:46.836
<i>﻿Did Daniel see this?</i>

339
00:27:46.996 --> 00:27:48.086
No.

340
00:27:48.586 --> 00:27:51.206
<i>﻿And you didn't call for a doctor?</i>

341
00:27:51.376 --> 00:27:54.836
No, I didn't realize it back then,
but looking back at it now,


342
00:27:54.996 --> 00:27:58.586
it seems like it might have been
a suicide attempt.


343
00:28:04.286 --> 00:28:05.786
<i>﻿Does anyone know about this?</i>

344
00:28:05.956 --> 00:28:06.996
No.

345
00:28:10.132 --> 00:28:11.626
<i>OK. I'll call you back.</i>

346
00:28:11.765 --> 00:28:12.956
Yes.

347
00:28:13.126 --> 00:28:14.286
- <i>OK.</i>
- Bye.


348
00:29:16.456 --> 00:29:17.876
<i>Is the light too bright?</i>

349
00:29:19.036 --> 00:29:20.996
<i>Want me to lower the blinds?</i>

350
00:29:21.876 --> 00:29:23.206
I'm OK.

351
00:29:23.376 --> 00:29:24.586
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.


352
00:29:24.746 --> 00:29:25.746
OK.

353
00:29:25.786 --> 00:29:29.246
<i>You didn't tell me about
your parents' arguments.</i>


354
00:29:31.786 --> 00:29:35.206
What do you mean?
I don't really remember any.


355
00:29:37.336 --> 00:29:41.036
When they start yelling,
I prefer to leave.


356
00:29:41.416 --> 00:29:44.666
<i>Can you tell me who was angrier?</i>

357
00:29:46.036 --> 00:29:47.086
No.

358
00:29:49.956 --> 00:29:53.786
<i>Is that why you left
the day your dad died?</i>


359
00:29:53.956 --> 00:29:56.496
No, I just felt like a walk.

360
00:29:57.672 --> 00:30:01.086
<i>OK. You say you heard
your parents when you left?</i>


361
00:30:01.496 --> 00:30:03.876
<i>Do you remember the conversation?</i>

362
00:30:04.706 --> 00:30:06.996
More or less. It wasn't a fight.

363
00:30:09.336 --> 00:30:12.246
I couldn't hear the words,
but it wasn't...


364
00:30:12.416 --> 00:30:15.086
<i>Then you don't know
it was a fight.</i>


365
00:30:15.246 --> 00:30:18.836
I could tell...
I could hear it wasn't a fight.


366
00:30:19.166 --> 00:30:22.166
<i>Daniel, the music was loud,
you were outside.</i>


367
00:30:22.336 --> 00:30:25.246
<i>They were in her bedroom,
two floors up.</i>


368
00:30:25.626 --> 00:30:27.496
<i>How can you be sure?</i>

369
00:30:27.886 --> 00:30:30.636
<i>I wonder
if you could hear them at all.</i>


370
00:30:30.786 --> 00:30:33.336
I was just below the open window.

371
00:30:33.496 --> 00:30:35.166
I know what I heard.

372
00:30:37.476 --> 00:30:38.556
OK.

373
00:30:44.246 --> 00:30:45.336
Is it over?

374
00:30:46.626 --> 00:30:50.036
How can you be so sure
where you were?


375
00:30:50.496 --> 00:30:52.456
<i>Because I touched the..</i>

376
00:30:52.626 --> 00:30:54.496
<i>Gaffer tape on the woodshed.</i>

377
00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:57.206
Gaffer tape?

378
00:30:57.586 --> 00:30:59.036
<i>When we moved in,</i>

379
00:30:59.266 --> 00:31:02.426
Dad put tape with
different textures everywhere,


380
00:31:02.586 --> 00:31:04.246
- so I could feel my way.
- Yes.


381
00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:08.786
I don't really need them now,
but I still touch them.


382
00:31:08.956 --> 00:31:10.746
Each piece feels different,

383
00:31:10.916 --> 00:31:12.166
I wouldn't get it wrong.

384
00:31:13.416 --> 00:31:15.416
I touched the woodshed tape.

385
00:31:17.206 --> 00:31:18.916
So I was under the window.

386
00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:20.206
OK.

387
00:31:26.416 --> 00:31:28.456
<i>I transposed what you told me.</i>

388
00:31:28.626 --> 00:31:30.506
But I didn't say it in French.

389
00:31:30.666 --> 00:31:32.916
<i>The volume is what matters here,</i>

390
00:31:33.086 --> 00:31:35.626
<i>and French is easier for everyone.</i>

391
00:31:36.456 --> 00:31:38.666
<i>Helene, start the music.</i>

392
00:31:44.786 --> 00:31:45.916
<i>Did it go well?</i>

393
00:31:46.086 --> 00:31:47.996
Yes, nothing special.

394
00:31:48.166 --> 00:31:49.786
<i>What's next this afternoon?</i>

395
00:31:49.956 --> 00:31:53.996
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.


396
00:31:54.206 --> 00:31:55.336
Not asking me?

397
00:31:55.496 --> 00:31:58.336
I assume
you'll keep working in the attic?


398
00:31:59.246 --> 00:32:00.496
Stop the music.

399
00:32:00.876 --> 00:32:01.956
<i>Stop.</i>

400
00:32:02.433 --> 00:32:03.439
So?

401
00:32:03.464 --> 00:32:04.786
Did you hear anything?

402
00:32:06.066 --> 00:32:08.686
<i>Let's go again, louder this time.</i>

403
00:32:09.376 --> 00:32:12.626
Louder? But I didn't shout at all.

404
00:32:12.786 --> 00:32:16.416
<i>The point of the reenactment
is to determine a credible volume.</i>


405
00:32:17.416 --> 00:32:19.086
Vincent, I never shouted.

406
00:32:19.996 --> 00:32:23.666
<i>She spoke no louder.
Her son says the voices were calm.</i>


407
00:32:23.836 --> 00:32:26.836
<i>That doesn't hold up.
The music drowns them out.</i>


408
00:32:27.586 --> 00:32:28.996
<i>My client didn't shout.</i>

409
00:32:29.206 --> 00:32:30.706
She won't shout now.

410
00:32:32.206 --> 00:32:33.206
Miss,

411
00:32:33.376 --> 00:32:35.246
please replace Mrs Voyter.

412
00:32:35.416 --> 00:32:37.876
<i>Come on in, please.</i>

413
00:32:39.456 --> 00:32:40.916
Play the music.

414
00:32:41.086 --> 00:32:42.416
<i>Start the music!</i>

415
00:32:45.086 --> 00:32:46.416
<i>Did it go well?</i>

416
00:32:46.646 --> 00:32:47.976
Yes, nothing special.

417
00:32:48.416 --> 00:32:50.086
What's next this afternoon?

418
00:32:50.246 --> 00:32:52.996
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.


419
00:33:00.356 --> 00:33:02.186
Go again, much louder.

420
00:33:03.166 --> 00:33:04.206
<i>Was it good?</i>

421
00:33:04.376 --> 00:33:05.916
<i>Yes, nothing special.</i>

422
00:33:06.806 --> 00:33:08.046
What's next this afternoon?

423
00:33:08.126 --> 00:33:11.666
I don't know, I'm tired.
I need to work, then I'll rest.


424
00:33:11.836 --> 00:33:13.666
Not asking me?

425
00:33:13.836 --> 00:33:16.246
<i>I assume
you'll keep working in the attic?</i>


426
00:33:17.246 --> 00:33:18.336
<i>Stop the music.</i>

427
00:33:19.706 --> 00:33:21.206
Now they hear it.

428
00:33:21.376 --> 00:33:22.416
Good.

429
00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:25.206
You do realize that was ridiculous?

430
00:33:25.376 --> 00:33:27.456
<i>Spare me your comments.</i>

431
00:33:28.266 --> 00:33:30.636
<i>It was calm voices, not like that.</i>

432
00:33:30.786 --> 00:33:34.166
But see,
you wouldn't have heard them.


433
00:33:36.246 --> 00:33:37.496
Right?

434
00:33:39.956 --> 00:33:43.036
Can we try one last time,
starting inside?


435
00:33:43.376 --> 00:33:45.166
With calm voices again.

436
00:33:47.086 --> 00:33:48.086
We can.

437
00:34:12.916 --> 00:34:14.536
I made a mistake.

438
00:34:14.706 --> 00:34:15.706
<i>Cut the music.</i>

439
00:34:15.746 --> 00:34:18.876
This is the tape I touched.
I was inside.


440
00:34:20.916 --> 00:34:21.996
I got mixed up.

441
00:34:22.166 --> 00:34:23.836
<i>That's not what you told us.</i>

442
00:34:23.996 --> 00:34:27.496
Zoé Solidor saw you
leave the house after she left.


443
00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:30.996
And your mom says
she spoke to your dad after that.


444
00:34:31.456 --> 00:34:32.916
I got mixed up.

445
00:34:33.876 --> 00:34:35.286
You got mixed up.

446
00:34:37.336 --> 00:34:38.536
Well.

447
00:36:24.376 --> 00:36:26.746
This afternoon was hard, wasn't it?

448
00:36:32.916 --> 00:36:34.166
I'm mad at myself.

449
00:36:35.536 --> 00:36:38.086
I thought I was sure, and then...

450
00:36:38.416 --> 00:36:40.336
But you didn't lie, did you?

451
00:36:45.024 --> 00:36:47.734
I don't want you
to change your memories.


452
00:36:48.456 --> 00:36:51.496
You have to tell them
exactly like you remember it.


453
00:36:52.456 --> 00:36:53.746
That can never hurt me.

454
00:36:58.706 --> 00:37:00.086
<i>Give me your hand.</i>

455
00:37:02.539 --> 00:37:03.749
Yes?

456
00:37:09.621 --> 00:37:11.121
What do we do now?

457
00:37:13.706 --> 00:37:14.996
You want a drink?

458
00:37:15.376 --> 00:37:16.386
Whiskey?

459
00:37:18.996 --> 00:37:20.086
Come.

460
00:37:21.894 --> 00:37:23.024
Sorry.

461
00:37:27.456 --> 00:37:28.746
All I can say is,

462
00:37:28.956 --> 00:37:33.536
the interrogation is in progress
and may continue for a while.


463
00:37:33.706 --> 00:37:36.286
She's been in there for 8 hours.

464
00:37:36.456 --> 00:37:38.036
Is she in trouble?

465
00:37:38.416 --> 00:37:40.586
Sandra Voyter is not in trouble.

466
00:37:40.746 --> 00:37:42.496
She maintains her innocence,

467
00:37:42.666 --> 00:37:44.586
so there will be no confession.

468
00:37:44.746 --> 00:37:48.126
You're confident,
but we've heard about a recording.


469
00:37:48.286 --> 00:37:49.786
Is it incriminating?

470
00:37:50.336 --> 00:37:52.166
You're not listening.

471
00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:56.456
She has not been indicted,
so nothing is incriminating.


472
00:37:56.626 --> 00:37:58.956
The so-called video is a myth so far.

473
00:37:59.126 --> 00:38:00.996
We've had no access to it.

474
00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:03.586
So, you confirm it's a video?

475
00:38:04.246 --> 00:38:08.166
No, I confirm nothing.
I said precisely the opposite.


476
00:38:08.336 --> 00:38:10.786
If there's nothing new,
why the summons?


477
00:38:10.956 --> 00:38:13.166
I don't know what to tell you.

478
00:38:13.336 --> 00:38:15.916
We don't understand it ourselves.
Thank you.


479
00:38:18.086 --> 00:38:19.286
Thank you for coming

480
00:38:20.416 --> 00:38:22.956
for the public prosecutor's
statement.


481
00:38:24.536 --> 00:38:28.246
So, Sandra Voyter was indicted
this morning at 8:30 a.m.


482
00:38:28.476 --> 00:38:32.766
The investigation revealed elements
that justify this decision.


483
00:38:32.916 --> 00:38:34.456
Three elements in particular.

484
00:38:35.286 --> 00:38:38.496
Analysis of Mr. 
Maleski's blood spatter

485
00:38:38.666 --> 00:38:41.246
found at the couple's domicile

486
00:38:41.416 --> 00:38:46.086
indicate he may have received
a blunt force blow to the head


487
00:38:46.246 --> 00:38:49.286
when he was
on the third-floor balcony.


488
00:38:49.786 --> 00:38:51.536
In addition,

489
00:38:51.766 --> 00:38:53.806
the reenactment
done three days ago


490
00:38:53.956 --> 00:38:57.246
brought to light
a number of discrepancies.


491
00:38:57.416 --> 00:38:58.586
Lastly,

492
00:38:58.746 --> 00:39:03.996
a file was discovered on a USB key
belonging to Mr. Maleski.


493
00:39:04.166 --> 00:39:06.706
All I can say about it, for now,

494
00:39:06.876 --> 00:39:10.126
is that it's an audio recording
of the couple,


495
00:39:10.286 --> 00:39:12.496
made the day before his death.

496
00:39:15.376 --> 00:39:19.166
As I'm trying to tell you,
she can't come sign herself


497
00:39:19.336 --> 00:39:22.746
because she's held up
at the courthouse.


498
00:39:23.206 --> 00:39:25.996
So it'll be me,
her lawyer Vincent Renzi,


499
00:39:26.166 --> 00:39:29.036
coming to get the documents for her.

500
00:39:29.836 --> 00:39:31.916
No, I can't come at 11.

501
00:39:32.456 --> 00:39:34.836
I can be there in 20 minutes?

502
00:39:35.836 --> 00:39:38.246
OK. Thanks, be right there.

503
00:39:38.416 --> 00:39:39.746
We have good news.

504
00:39:40.496 --> 00:39:44.036
The judge this afternoon
is not Da Silva, it's Bollène.


505
00:39:44.156 --> 00:39:45.156
OK.

506
00:39:45.586 --> 00:39:46.746
I'm off to the bank.

507
00:39:46.916 --> 00:39:48.706
And the home equity loan?

508
00:39:51.086 --> 00:39:54.666
Less than we hoped.
They have money problems.


509
00:39:54.836 --> 00:39:56.416
Outstanding credit, etc.

510
00:39:56.586 --> 00:39:59.496
The bank will only do 50,000.

511
00:39:59.666 --> 00:40:02.876
Bail will be more than that.

512
00:40:03.766 --> 00:40:06.016
Her son is a witness.

513
00:40:06.166 --> 00:40:08.166
He'll be testifying in court.

514
00:40:08.336 --> 00:40:12.496
There is obviously a risk
of her exerting pressure on him.


515
00:40:12.666 --> 00:40:14.086
As a consequence,

516
00:40:14.246 --> 00:40:17.336
release on bail is not an option.

517
00:40:17.496 --> 00:40:21.996
I'm asking you to place Mrs Voyter
in detention pending trial.


518
00:40:22.496 --> 00:40:24.996
Thank you.
Over to you, Mrs Boudaoud.


519
00:40:25.226 --> 00:40:28.476
Judge, how can we
consider her a flight risk,


520
00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:30.786
when she's responsible for her son?

521
00:40:31.016 --> 00:40:32.516
That makes no sense.

522
00:40:32.666 --> 00:40:34.706
With a visually impaired child?

523
00:40:34.876 --> 00:40:37.376
And she's all over the media.

524
00:40:37.536 --> 00:40:40.586
Separating them
could compound his trauma.


525
00:40:40.746 --> 00:40:43.956
He had an accident
at the age of four


526
00:40:44.186 --> 00:40:45.226
that damaged his sight.

527
00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:46.956
He's been traumatized,

528
00:40:47.126 --> 00:40:49.706
both psychologically and emotionally.

529
00:40:52.686 --> 00:40:54.436
Mrs Boudaoud, your reaction?

530
00:40:55.146 --> 00:40:58.846
The judge's decision is rare
enough to merit praise.


531
00:40:58.996 --> 00:41:02.496
A judge refusing to give in
to repressive reflexes


532
00:41:02.666 --> 00:41:05.126
is a healthy sign,
especially in such a case.


533
00:41:05.336 --> 00:41:08.746
We feel the release
under judicial supervision


534
00:41:08.916 --> 00:41:11.126
underscores the weakness of the case.

535
00:41:11.336 --> 00:41:12.876
Is your client relieved?

536
00:41:15.836 --> 00:41:18.956
This is a rare decision
in a homicide accusation,


537
00:41:19.126 --> 00:41:21.586
and reads like
a repudiation of Judge Janvier.


538
00:41:21.746 --> 00:41:24.706
Reactions in the hallways
have been intense.


539
00:41:24.936 --> 00:41:28.186
I quote,
"This decision is dangerous."


540
00:41:28.336 --> 00:41:31.166
"The suspect will be reunited
with a major witness."


541
00:41:31.336 --> 00:41:34.536
"It's a real concern
for the upcoming trial."


542
00:41:46.876 --> 00:41:48.706
How could you not tell me about it?

543
00:41:48.876 --> 00:41:50.496
I had no idea he recorded it.

544
00:41:50.596 --> 00:41:51.786
Even if he hadn't...

545
00:41:51.936 --> 00:41:54.516
You had a fight
the day before he died.


546
00:42:12.206 --> 00:42:13.666
That recording

547
00:42:14.246 --> 00:42:15.956
is not reality.

548
00:42:17.286 --> 00:42:18.706
It's a part of it, maybe,

549
00:42:18.876 --> 00:42:22.956
if you have an extreme moment,
an emotional peak you focus on,


550
00:42:23.126 --> 00:42:25.206
of course it crushes everything.

551
00:42:25.536 --> 00:42:29.586
It may seem like irrefutable proof,
but actually warps everything.


552
00:42:29.746 --> 00:42:33.036
It's not reality. It's our voices,
but it's not who we are.


553
00:42:33.266 --> 00:42:35.766
I don't give a fuck
about what is reality. OK.


554
00:42:36.376 --> 00:42:38.206
You need to start seeing yourself

555
00:42:38.376 --> 00:42:40.336
the way others
are going to perceive you.


556
00:42:40.496 --> 00:42:42.416
The trial is not about the truth.

557
00:42:42.586 --> 00:42:45.376
- I didn't know there'd be a trial.
- Well, there is.


558
00:42:56.376 --> 00:42:59.456
Now, what really counts is...

559
00:43:00.416 --> 00:43:02.496
who you have around you.

560
00:43:02.666 --> 00:43:04.036
There's nobody around me.

561
00:43:04.266 --> 00:43:05.516
Yes, there's Daniel.

562
00:43:06.376 --> 00:43:07.876
Daniel is important.

563
00:43:09.376 --> 00:43:11.996
And didn't you and Samuel have...

564
00:43:12.166 --> 00:43:13.706
any friends?

565
00:43:13.876 --> 00:43:17.956
We should never have come here.
I was so happy in London.


566
00:43:20.876 --> 00:43:22.416
It was him, he insisted.

567
00:43:22.586 --> 00:43:25.496
He said there'd be no more
distractions from work.


568
00:43:25.916 --> 00:43:28.336
It would solve
our financial problems.


569
00:43:34.416 --> 00:43:38.956
I left my shithole in Germany
and ended up stuck in his shithole.


570
00:43:39.126 --> 00:43:41.086
It's fucking absurd, isn't it? Come on!

571
00:43:49.206 --> 00:43:50.246
- Hello.
- Hello.


572
00:43:52.586 --> 00:43:53.956
Hi, kitten.

573
00:43:55.836 --> 00:43:57.336
This is Mrs Berger,

574
00:43:57.536 --> 00:43:59.916
appointed by the Justice Minister.

575
00:44:00.086 --> 00:44:01.336
Hello.

576
00:44:01.536 --> 00:44:03.286
Vincent Renzi, 
I work with Nour.

577
00:44:03.746 --> 00:44:06.746
She'll be here regularly, with...

578
00:44:07.496 --> 00:44:09.286
Daniel, and with you.

579
00:44:09.876 --> 00:44:11.836
The frequency will be specified.

580
00:44:11.996 --> 00:44:13.916
She's here...

581
00:44:14.916 --> 00:44:17.586
to ensure that everything goes well.

582
00:44:17.956 --> 00:44:21.706
And that no one
tries to influence Daniel,


583
00:44:21.876 --> 00:44:26.206
or make him say things
he doesn't want to say at the trial.


584
00:44:26.836 --> 00:44:30.456
The judge says you must
speak French in her presence.


585
00:44:32.786 --> 00:44:33.836
Right.

586
00:44:37.416 --> 00:44:38.496
That's it.

587
00:44:40.536 --> 00:44:42.746
May I speak with Daniel in private?

588
00:44:45.996 --> 00:44:47.496
OK, shall we go?

589
00:44:47.666 --> 00:44:48.666
I'll call you.

590
00:44:48.706 --> 00:44:51.876
Your mother will give us
space to get acquainted.


591
00:44:58.586 --> 00:45:00.246
My name is Marge.

592
00:45:00.806 --> 00:45:02.716
We'll see each other a lot.

593
00:45:03.666 --> 00:45:05.586
Do you know why I'm here?

594
00:45:06.376 --> 00:45:07.706
Are you OK with it?

595
00:45:09.126 --> 00:45:10.996
You can consider me a friend.

596
00:45:12.086 --> 00:45:14.286
Or not. That's your choice.

597
00:45:14.456 --> 00:45:15.456
What do you think?

598
00:45:16.416 --> 00:45:17.876
It's OK, I don't...

599
00:45:18.836 --> 00:45:20.956
I don't need us to be friends.

600
00:45:24.376 --> 00:45:27.206
Well, I'm here
to protect your testimony.


601
00:45:27.786 --> 00:45:29.996
The law sent me, and...

602
00:45:30.456 --> 00:45:32.836
the law can't be someone's friend.

603
00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:36.126
Otherwise it couldn't be
someone else's friend,


604
00:45:36.286 --> 00:45:38.746
and the law must be
the same for everyone.


605
00:45:40.036 --> 00:45:42.586
So you're right,
I can't be your friend.


606
00:45:43.786 --> 00:45:47.336
You just have to tell me
if anything feels strange,


607
00:45:47.496 --> 00:45:50.246
if there's a problem,

608
00:45:50.416 --> 00:45:51.496
I don't know,

609
00:45:51.666 --> 00:45:53.416
for example with your mom,

610
00:45:53.586 --> 00:45:55.036
regarding the trial.

611
00:45:56.876 --> 00:46:00.626
I usually discuss stuff like
that with my friends.


612
00:46:03.416 --> 00:46:04.456
Right.

613
00:46:05.036 --> 00:46:07.746
Maybe this time
you don't really have a choice.


614
00:46:29.626 --> 00:46:31.836
With chocolate chips...

615
00:46:34.086 --> 00:46:35.536
and raspberries...

616
00:46:36.836 --> 00:46:39.536
I know it doesn't exist
but that's what I vow.


617
00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:48.036
The archduchess's socks...

618
00:46:49.746 --> 00:46:50.786
What?

619
00:46:51.786 --> 00:46:54.836
The archduchess's socks...

620
00:47:28.206 --> 00:47:30.586
He was
one of the only persons I knew,


621
00:47:30.746 --> 00:47:32.336
when he walked into a room,

622
00:47:32.786 --> 00:47:34.626
something shifted,

623
00:47:34.786 --> 00:47:36.916
the atmosphere changed.

624
00:47:37.246 --> 00:47:40.246
And I suppose that's charm, isn't it?

625
00:47:40.416 --> 00:47:42.916
I fell in love with his charm.

626
00:47:47.126 --> 00:47:51.786
I spend my whole life
not understanding family and friends.


627
00:47:52.666 --> 00:47:56.036
And then he came along,
and I felt like...


628
00:47:57.336 --> 00:48:01.206
I understood what he was saying,
the signals he was sending me.


629
00:48:03.166 --> 00:48:05.036
We didn't necessarily agree,

630
00:48:05.246 --> 00:48:06.916
but we had...

631
00:48:08.586 --> 00:48:10.626
We had things to tell each other.

632
00:48:11.586 --> 00:48:14.206
I realized that later,
when it was gone.


633
00:48:14.876 --> 00:48:16.626
Don't say it's gone.

634
00:48:17.586 --> 00:48:19.536
Just focus on him.

635
00:48:20.416 --> 00:48:21.706
How you met.

636
00:48:23.706 --> 00:48:27.456
When we met, he'd just gotten a job
at a university in London.


637
00:48:28.956 --> 00:48:30.706
So... we moved there together.

638
00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:34.626
He was a great teacher.

639
00:48:35.126 --> 00:48:39.286
He had a way of making everything
sound alive and accessible,


640
00:48:39.456 --> 00:48:40.706
it was great.

641
00:48:43.586 --> 00:48:45.786
But some...
But that wasn't really enough,


642
00:48:46.586 --> 00:48:47.626
so...

643
00:48:48.336 --> 00:48:51.706
Deep down, what he really wanted
to do was to write.


644
00:48:52.336 --> 00:48:54.916
He was working on a novel for years.

645
00:48:55.086 --> 00:48:57.086
I watched him struggle, it was hard.

646
00:49:02.746 --> 00:49:04.416
And I came to realize

647
00:49:04.586 --> 00:49:08.456
his relationship with time,
with work, was...


648
00:49:09.586 --> 00:49:11.626
complicated, unlike for me...

649
00:49:11.786 --> 00:49:14.126
No,
stop comparing yourself to him.


650
00:49:14.356 --> 00:49:15.436
Just to...

651
00:49:15.586 --> 00:49:17.416
Go back to your relationship.

652
00:49:21.086 --> 00:49:25.916
Our relationship revolved
around intellectual stimulation,


653
00:49:26.086 --> 00:49:28.536
even if it meant
neglecting everything else.


654
00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:30.376
Everything else?

655
00:49:31.206 --> 00:49:32.206
Meaning Daniel?

656
00:49:34.186 --> 00:49:36.016
We should mention Daniel
early on.


657
00:49:36.496 --> 00:49:38.036
The accident.

658
00:49:38.206 --> 00:49:40.336
OK. I didn't know it was so...

659
00:49:44.456 --> 00:49:46.086
- It's OK?
- It's OK.


660
00:49:46.836 --> 00:49:50.126
It's just that I didn't know
that it was so...


661
00:49:50.706 --> 00:49:52.036
like this, OK.

662
00:49:55.836 --> 00:49:58.456
Everything changed
after the accident.


663
00:50:00.086 --> 00:50:01.536
Daniel was four.

664
00:50:03.876 --> 00:50:08.376
That day, Samuel was supposed
to pick him up from school.


665
00:50:08.836 --> 00:50:11.666
But he was on a roll
with his writing, so...


666
00:50:12.166 --> 00:50:16.286
he called a babysitter last minute,
and she showed up late.


667
00:50:17.246 --> 00:50:18.796
As they were crossing the street,

668
00:50:18.896 --> 00:50:20.266
a motorcycle hit Daniel.

669
00:50:20.416 --> 00:50:23.206
His optic nerve
was permanently damaged.


670
00:50:28.376 --> 00:50:29.586
After that,

671
00:50:30.586 --> 00:50:33.536
Samuel became obsessive about it,

672
00:50:33.706 --> 00:50:35.416
he blamed himself on a loop.

673
00:50:35.586 --> 00:50:37.786
If only he'd gone,
picked him up in time...


674
00:50:40.336 --> 00:50:42.786
He was overcome with guilt.

675
00:50:45.786 --> 00:50:48.206
Perhaps he never
truly escaped that feeling.


676
00:50:49.586 --> 00:50:52.416
We spent that whole year
at the hospital,


677
00:50:53.086 --> 00:50:54.336
with Daniel.

678
00:50:55.626 --> 00:50:58.166
We began having financial problems

679
00:50:59.586 --> 00:51:02.786
and Samuel started
taking antidepressants.


680
00:51:04.706 --> 00:51:07.126
Can we please keep that clean,
Vincent?


681
00:51:07.286 --> 00:51:11.206
I'd really like to protect him
and his image, and spare Daniel.


682
00:51:13.586 --> 00:51:14.666
We'll try.

683
00:51:14.836 --> 00:51:15.996
OK.

684
00:51:16.456 --> 00:51:18.836
But it will be like that,
I have to...


685
00:51:19.916 --> 00:51:22.376
I have to admit things.

686
00:51:24.456 --> 00:51:26.916
You have to prepare yourself

687
00:51:27.586 --> 00:51:31.036
to tell everything, and the challenge
is to do it in French.


688
00:51:33.206 --> 00:51:34.666
OK.

689
00:52:12.956 --> 00:52:18.126
One year later.

690
00:52:20.166 --> 00:52:21.996
Are you really interested in...

691
00:52:22.166 --> 00:52:24.876
What interests you?
Come on, sure.


692
00:52:25.786 --> 00:52:28.166
I never see anybody,
I work here all day long,


693
00:52:28.336 --> 00:52:30.746
you come to see me,
of course you interest me.


694
00:52:33.996 --> 00:52:35.166
I run.

695
00:52:35.666 --> 00:52:37.996
It's one of my favorite things to do.

696
00:52:38.166 --> 00:52:40.416
Makes me feel high,
like I'm on drugs.


697
00:52:41.876 --> 00:52:45.036
What do you know about drugs?
That's the next question.


698
00:52:46.626 --> 00:52:47.746
Big subject.

699
00:52:48.706 --> 00:52:50.376
Maybe don't write everything down.

700
00:52:50.456 --> 00:52:52.166
No surely not.

701
00:52:56.706 --> 00:53:00.206
I told you,
we should have done this in Grenoble.


702
00:53:01.086 --> 00:53:02.086
It's fine.

703
00:53:02.206 --> 00:53:03.876
I'll write your answers down.

704
00:53:09.206 --> 00:53:12.706
Do you confirm this is your
interview with Mrs Voyter?


705
00:53:12.876 --> 00:53:13.996
Yes.

706
00:53:14.206 --> 00:53:17.746
She refuses to talk about herself,
yet that's why you came.


707
00:53:17.916 --> 00:53:20.206
I came to talk about her work.

708
00:53:20.376 --> 00:53:23.706
Right, but by constantly
changing the subject,


709
00:53:23.876 --> 00:53:26.626
what was she looking for,
do you suppose?


710
00:53:27.086 --> 00:53:30.166
We can hear it.
She asks about me.


711
00:53:30.836 --> 00:53:34.916
She seemed to enjoy talking about me
more than herself.


712
00:53:35.836 --> 00:53:38.416
Was she inciting you
to talk about yourself?


713
00:53:38.836 --> 00:53:40.206
Inciting...

714
00:53:40.746 --> 00:53:42.746
No, I wouldn't say that.

715
00:53:42.916 --> 00:53:45.336
She wasn't manipulative,
just relaxed.


716
00:53:45.496 --> 00:53:48.916
It felt natural.
She seemed to enjoy the conversation.


717
00:53:49.146 --> 00:53:53.346
You say "relaxed".
We hear her serve you wine at 1:45.


718
00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:56.036
Had she been drinking
before you arrived?


719
00:53:56.786 --> 00:53:57.786
I think so.

720
00:53:57.836 --> 00:54:00.836
Would you say she did her utmost

721
00:54:00.996 --> 00:54:02.376
to make you comfortable,

722
00:54:02.536 --> 00:54:07.166
more than you might've expected
when interviewing a writer?


723
00:54:07.376 --> 00:54:09.996
I wouldn't say that, no.

724
00:54:10.166 --> 00:54:13.166
It seemed like Sandra... Mrs Voyter,

725
00:54:13.336 --> 00:54:16.246
needed to escape, to relax.

726
00:54:16.416 --> 00:54:17.416
- Escape?
- Right.


727
00:54:17.626 --> 00:54:21.286
Did you know that Sandra,
as you call her, was bisexual?


728
00:54:23.086 --> 00:54:24.086
No.

729
00:54:24.126 --> 00:54:25.786
Did you sense it?

730
00:54:25.956 --> 00:54:27.086
No.

731
00:54:27.996 --> 00:54:31.836
Hearing the conversation now,
with hindsight,


732
00:54:32.786 --> 00:54:34.626
would you call it seduction?

733
00:54:36.416 --> 00:54:40.336
I felt, and she told me herself,
that she didn't have


734
00:54:40.496 --> 00:54:44.036
much of a social life
or many chances to talk


735
00:54:44.246 --> 00:54:45.536
to new people.

736
00:54:45.706 --> 00:54:49.626
I suppose you could call that
a form of seduction.


737
00:54:50.416 --> 00:54:54.036
The court needs to know
if you would call it that.


738
00:54:54.956 --> 00:54:56.456
Seduction means several things.

739
00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:59.416
But the word seduction
always implies some...


740
00:54:59.916 --> 00:55:00.916
seduction.

741
00:55:00.956 --> 00:55:02.286
The witness's answer

742
00:55:02.496 --> 00:55:06.246
is clear enough,
as to what she means by seduction.


743
00:55:06.416 --> 00:55:09.876
Mrs Voyter kept expressing
her interest in you.


744
00:55:10.036 --> 00:55:12.586
She wanted to do the interview
in Grenoble.


745
00:55:13.336 --> 00:55:14.336
Didn't you sense...

746
00:55:14.496 --> 00:55:15.996
She answered that question.

747
00:55:16.166 --> 00:55:18.666
Not very clearly.
Please answer, Miss Solidor.


748
00:55:19.086 --> 00:55:20.836
Could you call me Mrs?

749
00:55:21.376 --> 00:55:23.876
I dislike being reduced
to a marital status.


750
00:55:24.036 --> 00:55:26.206
Of course.
That wasn't my intention.


751
00:55:26.536 --> 00:55:28.836
I didn't feel seduced in the moment.

752
00:55:28.996 --> 00:55:31.666
So you did wonder afterwards?

753
00:55:32.706 --> 00:55:35.086
I found it atypical, nothing more.

754
00:55:35.286 --> 00:55:39.416
How did you interpret the song
Samuel Maleski played?


755
00:55:40.626 --> 00:55:42.626
I felt tension around the noise.

756
00:55:42.786 --> 00:55:47.166
Samuel Maleski imposing
his presence without showing himself.


757
00:55:47.496 --> 00:55:49.036
And Sandra's reaction...

758
00:55:49.246 --> 00:55:50.786
What was her reaction?

759
00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:54.786
She was a bit annoyed.

760
00:55:55.456 --> 00:55:58.036
And when the song started over?

761
00:55:58.666 --> 00:56:00.376
He was playing it on a loop.

762
00:56:01.666 --> 00:56:03.126
Clearly...

763
00:56:03.586 --> 00:56:04.786
good deduction.

764
00:56:04.956 --> 00:56:07.956
But how did it feel to you
in the moment?


765
00:56:08.626 --> 00:56:10.246
It added to the strangeness.

766
00:56:10.996 --> 00:56:13.496
I felt my presence was less...

767
00:56:15.026 --> 00:56:16.386
It was less relaxed.

768
00:56:16.496 --> 00:56:18.206
So you clearly felt tension.

769
00:56:18.376 --> 00:56:21.126
- You're nitpicking.
- No, just clarifying.


770
00:56:21.286 --> 00:56:22.996
Did you feel tension?

771
00:56:23.166 --> 00:56:24.246
Yes.

772
00:56:25.836 --> 00:56:29.496
Did you feel that Mr. Maleski,
by playing that music,


773
00:56:30.036 --> 00:56:33.166
wanted to disrupt, or interrupt,
your interview?


774
00:56:33.406 --> 00:56:35.656
That was my first thought, yes.

775
00:56:36.706 --> 00:56:41.086
But it's hard to read the intentions
of someone you can't see.


776
00:56:41.706 --> 00:56:43.536
That's what they pay me for!

777
00:56:45.376 --> 00:56:46.666
Sandra Voyter,

778
00:56:47.166 --> 00:56:50.246
you sought a connection
to divert the interview.


779
00:56:50.476 --> 00:56:51.846
Correct?

780
00:56:51.996 --> 00:56:53.536
That's a leading question.

781
00:56:53.706 --> 00:56:55.416
There was no seduction.

782
00:56:55.746 --> 00:56:57.786
My question concerns your connection.

783
00:56:57.956 --> 00:57:02.036
In the recording you're chummy,
laughing, drinking wine.


784
00:57:02.206 --> 00:57:05.206
Were you seeking escape
from a difficult home-life


785
00:57:05.376 --> 00:57:07.456
by connecting with this young woman?

786
00:57:07.626 --> 00:57:10.206
Mrs Voyter
did not initiate the meeting.


787
00:57:10.416 --> 00:57:12.376
Please answer, Mrs Voyter.

788
00:57:14.206 --> 00:57:16.536
Yes, I found her surprising.

789
00:57:16.706 --> 00:57:19.536
I hadn't seen anyone new in a while.

790
00:57:19.706 --> 00:57:21.996
And yes, I needed a drink.

791
00:57:22.166 --> 00:57:26.336
This person was intelligent and nice,
nothing more.


792
00:57:27.206 --> 00:57:31.036
That interview was hardly enough
to base a thesis on!


793
00:57:31.206 --> 00:57:35.746
She can have a laugh with a student
whose questions don't thrill her.


794
00:57:35.916 --> 00:57:38.996
Would you say the music
Mr. Maleski played


795
00:57:39.166 --> 00:57:41.166
so aggressively

796
00:57:41.336 --> 00:57:43.206
indicated he was jealous of you,

797
00:57:43.376 --> 00:57:45.536
or Miss... Mrs Solidor? Sorry.

798
00:57:45.746 --> 00:57:48.416
The music was a cover
of 50 Cent's P.I.M.P.,


799
00:57:48.586 --> 00:57:50.836
a deeply misogynistic song.

800
00:57:50.996 --> 00:57:52.786
It was an instrumental version.

801
00:57:52.956 --> 00:57:54.416
Answer, please.

802
00:57:54.626 --> 00:57:58.416
Could your husband's song choice
express his jealousy?


803
00:57:58.586 --> 00:57:59.586
I can answer.

804
00:58:01.036 --> 00:58:04.536
He often played that song.
I doubt it was intentional.


805
00:58:05.586 --> 00:58:08.786
He loved loud music, it relaxed him.

806
00:58:10.456 --> 00:58:13.286
He had purposefully installed...

807
00:58:14.746 --> 00:58:16.626
What is a "speaker"? Sorry.

808
00:58:17.626 --> 00:58:20.246
A powerful speaker... sorry.

809
00:58:21.036 --> 00:58:22.996
He worked a lot, it was noisy...

810
00:58:23.206 --> 00:58:26.536
Mrs Solidor says
you ended the interview over that.


811
00:58:26.706 --> 00:58:29.166
- Is that true?
- She never said that.


812
00:58:29.336 --> 00:58:30.636
If the defense

813
00:58:31.246 --> 00:58:34.416
keeps reacting to every question,

814
00:58:34.586 --> 00:58:36.496
I'll be very irritated.

815
00:58:37.626 --> 00:58:39.586
Mrs Voyter, answer the question.

816
00:58:42.246 --> 00:58:44.876
The music was just very loud.

817
00:58:45.036 --> 00:58:47.206
And when it started over,

818
00:58:47.376 --> 00:58:50.416
I realized it wasn't going to stop.

819
00:58:51.916 --> 00:58:54.876
That made discussion difficult.

820
00:58:55.036 --> 00:58:56.916
So I...

821
00:58:57.956 --> 00:58:59.416
I preferred to stop.

822
00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:02.336
And I was tired, yes.

823
00:59:02.496 --> 00:59:03.746
And I felt a bit...

824
00:59:05.586 --> 00:59:07.456
woozy, from the wine.

825
00:59:08.206 --> 00:59:11.746
Yet once alone, you didn't ask
him to explain his behavior?


826
00:59:13.536 --> 00:59:15.746
As I said, it was habitual.

827
00:59:15.916 --> 00:59:17.246
No.

828
00:59:17.456 --> 00:59:20.586
You entertaining
an attractive young woman


829
00:59:20.746 --> 00:59:24.246
while he toiled upstairs
was neither habitual, nor neutral.


830
00:59:24.416 --> 00:59:27.246
He knew you liked women.
You'd recently cheated.


831
00:59:27.416 --> 00:59:28.996
That's beside the point.

832
00:59:29.226 --> 00:59:30.116
And sexist.

833
00:59:30.206 --> 00:59:33.076
I'd have said the same
if she were an attractive man.


834
00:59:33.206 --> 00:59:36.916
Excuse me, but this couple's
conflicts matter here.


835
00:59:37.126 --> 00:59:39.996
There's something
a bit strange in this situation.


836
00:59:40.166 --> 00:59:43.746
You say you went upstairs
to your room to work and sleep.


837
00:59:43.916 --> 00:59:47.416
Right below the attic
with the deafening music.


838
00:59:47.586 --> 00:59:50.746
Music that had made
the interview impossible.


839
00:59:50.916 --> 00:59:53.166
In that big house,
you chose that spot?


840
00:59:53.376 --> 00:59:57.126
Yes, that's where I work.
I always work in bed.


841
00:59:59.586 --> 01:00:02.836
When Samuel came to talk to you,
you didn't complain?


842
01:00:02.996 --> 01:00:06.286
Deafening music overhead
is hardly normal.


843
01:00:08.206 --> 01:00:09.706
I'm used to it, I don't mind.

844
01:00:09.876 --> 01:00:12.626
I wanted to work, 
I had my earplugs.

845
01:00:12.786 --> 01:00:13.836
It was normal.

846
01:00:14.626 --> 01:00:16.626
I can work in any situation.

847
01:00:16.836 --> 01:00:19.496
You said you were tired,
woozy from the wine.


848
01:00:19.666 --> 01:00:21.536
Yet you wanted to work?

849
01:00:21.746 --> 01:00:22.746
Yes.

850
01:00:22.876 --> 01:00:24.626
And I did. Not for long.

851
01:00:24.786 --> 01:00:26.336
A translation was due.

852
01:00:26.496 --> 01:00:28.746
I wanted to finish it before resting.

853
01:00:29.336 --> 01:00:33.376
As I said, I can work
in any environment, any condition.


854
01:00:33.586 --> 01:00:36.746
Apparently you can also rest
anywhere, anytime.


855
01:00:36.916 --> 01:00:39.036
So all was well with the world.

856
01:00:44.126 --> 01:00:45.146
That's all.

857
01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:50.126
No further questions.

858
01:00:53.206 --> 01:00:55.376
Daniel, that's not what you told us.

859
01:00:55.536 --> 01:00:58.456
Zoe Solidor saw you
leave the house after she left.


860
01:00:58.626 --> 01:01:01.916
And your mom says
she spoke to your dad after that.


861
01:01:03.536 --> 01:01:04.746
I got mixed up.

862
01:01:05.586 --> 01:01:06.836
You got mixed up.

863
01:01:13.086 --> 01:01:15.286
Indeed there is a problem, Daniel.

864
01:01:15.456 --> 01:01:16.456
Right?

865
01:01:16.586 --> 01:01:19.286
You couldn't be two places at once.

866
01:01:20.786 --> 01:01:23.166
I think I went back inside.

867
01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:30.086
What bothers me is how sure you were
before the reenactment.


868
01:01:30.456 --> 01:01:32.666
You said in your statement:

869
01:01:32.836 --> 01:01:35.586
"Each piece of tape feels different."

870
01:01:35.746 --> 01:01:38.456
"I wouldn't get it wrong."

871
01:01:39.086 --> 01:01:41.746
And:
"I was just below the open window."


872
01:01:41.916 --> 01:01:43.746
"I know what I heard."

873
01:01:43.916 --> 01:01:47.496
Then, during the reenactment,
you said something else entirely.


874
01:01:47.666 --> 01:01:49.286
How come?

875
01:01:51.996 --> 01:01:55.036
I thought
I remembered where I was, but...


876
01:01:57.536 --> 01:02:01.286
Maybe the shock of what happened next
got me mixed up.


877
01:02:01.666 --> 01:02:03.786
A psychiatrist who met with Daniel

878
01:02:03.956 --> 01:02:07.746
says emotional shock
may have altered some memories.


879
01:02:08.196 --> 01:02:09.106
Of course.

880
01:02:09.206 --> 01:02:12.036
Do you remember now
why you came back inside?


881
01:02:14.246 --> 01:02:16.246
I think I must've forgotten...

882
01:02:16.916 --> 01:02:18.536
my gloves or my phone.

883
01:02:19.416 --> 01:02:20.746
But you're not sure?

884
01:02:22.246 --> 01:02:23.996
I don't remember exactly.

885
01:02:24.166 --> 01:02:27.666
So, you went from absolute certainty
to uncertainty


886
01:02:27.836 --> 01:02:30.246
about your memories of that day.

887
01:02:30.416 --> 01:02:32.336
This is very problematic.

888
01:02:32.496 --> 01:02:35.496
You're fixating on one detail
in his memory


889
01:02:35.666 --> 01:02:38.206
to cast doubt on his whole memory.

890
01:02:38.626 --> 01:02:40.336
What do you want us to believe?

891
01:02:40.496 --> 01:02:43.836
That shock may have turned yelling
into calm voices?


892
01:02:43.996 --> 01:02:46.916
You insinuate
he lied to protect his mother.


893
01:02:47.086 --> 01:02:48.206
No.

894
01:02:48.746 --> 01:02:51.036
I'm merely signaling
the witness's doubts.


895
01:02:51.206 --> 01:02:53.456
But we are entitled to wonder.

896
01:02:53.626 --> 01:02:57.456
Daniel Maleski says he would leave
when his parents fought.


897
01:02:57.626 --> 01:03:00.836
Whereas on that day,
he happens to go out


898
01:03:00.996 --> 01:03:03.746
right when an argument
is likely to erupt.


899
01:03:03.916 --> 01:03:05.836
Thus, he doesn't hear a thing.

900
01:03:06.286 --> 01:03:08.916
I didn't happen to go out.
I fled the music.


901
01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:13.086
And he's very precise
about what he heard.


902
01:03:13.246 --> 01:03:14.916
He's never budged on that.

903
01:03:15.496 --> 01:03:18.706
The psychiatrist
and visual impairment expert


904
01:03:18.876 --> 01:03:22.126
both observed
Daniel's excellent aural memory.


905
01:03:28.286 --> 01:03:31.706
Clerk, please display

906
01:03:31.876 --> 01:03:34.376
the elements provided by Mr. Balard.

907
01:03:36.746 --> 01:03:38.286
We're listening.

908
01:03:38.456 --> 01:03:41.956
The decisive element here
is the three blood spatters


909
01:03:42.186 --> 01:03:43.516
on the woodshed,

910
01:03:43.666 --> 01:03:46.286
as indicated on the sketch.

911
01:03:47.246 --> 01:03:49.996
Can we zoom in on the woodshed?

912
01:03:51.336 --> 01:03:55.126
Their shape is typical of spatter
projected from high above.


913
01:03:55.356 --> 01:03:57.606
They are long and narrow.

914
01:03:57.806 --> 01:04:02.056
The longest measures 4 centimeters,
which is a lot.


915
01:04:02.586 --> 01:04:04.246
So, according to our tests,

916
01:04:04.416 --> 01:04:06.956
these spatters
could only have landed here


917
01:04:07.126 --> 01:04:09.666
if Mr. Maleski was struck on the head

918
01:04:09.836 --> 01:04:12.246
while on the 3rd floor balcony.

919
01:04:13.286 --> 01:04:16.336
He would have to have been
leaning over the balcony,


920
01:04:16.496 --> 01:04:20.166
his head already quite far out
when the blow was struck,


921
01:04:20.336 --> 01:04:22.916
for the spatter to land there.

922
01:04:23.146 --> 01:04:24.936
No other explanation stands.

923
01:04:25.086 --> 01:04:28.996
Did the violence of the blow
make Mr. Maleski fall?


924
01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:30.286
Most likely,

925
01:04:30.496 --> 01:04:33.916
it was the combination
of a violent blow


926
01:04:34.086 --> 01:04:36.166
and a deliberate push.

927
01:04:36.336 --> 01:04:40.126
Would you say the aggressor
was in a state of extreme anger,


928
01:04:40.336 --> 01:04:43.956
to provoke a fall after
administering such a violent blow?


929
01:04:44.166 --> 01:04:46.286
A state of rage, I'd say.

930
01:04:46.456 --> 01:04:48.086
Hard to imagine anything less.

931
01:04:48.286 --> 01:04:52.456
Such states
can increase physical strength.


932
01:05:03.786 --> 01:05:08.536
The guardrail is 1.2 meters high.

933
01:05:08.706 --> 01:05:11.746
Comes up to about here.

934
01:05:12.246 --> 01:05:14.916
Mr. Maleski was 1.82 meters tall

935
01:05:15.086 --> 01:05:17.206
and weighed 85 kilos.

936
01:05:17.536 --> 01:05:20.586
So, pushing him over that guardrail

937
01:05:20.746 --> 01:05:24.496
would have required
a very deliberate push, right?


938
01:05:24.666 --> 01:05:27.666
The entire act was very deliberate.

939
01:05:27.836 --> 01:05:29.996
Such a blow is always intentional.

940
01:05:30.206 --> 01:05:32.336
What I mean by very deliberate is...

941
01:05:32.496 --> 01:05:35.286
very coordinated. Methodical.

942
01:05:35.456 --> 01:05:37.876
Based on his weight, we can assume

943
01:05:38.036 --> 01:05:41.496
it was necessary to lift his legs
to make him fall,


944
01:05:41.666 --> 01:05:43.626
which hardly suggests rage.

945
01:05:43.786 --> 01:05:45.496
Rage does not exclude will.

946
01:05:45.666 --> 01:05:49.836
And Mr. Maleski was probably
already off-balance.


947
01:05:49.996 --> 01:05:51.586
He may have fallen

948
01:05:51.746 --> 01:05:55.166
as much from the blow
as from his own unstable position.


949
01:05:55.376 --> 01:05:58.086
As I said,
we have no material elements...


950
01:05:58.246 --> 01:06:00.376
Except those 3 drops of blood.

951
01:06:01.456 --> 01:06:06.416
Everything else must be speculated
to explain those drops, right?


952
01:06:06.586 --> 01:06:09.876
OK, but the only explanation
is the one I gave.


953
01:06:10.106 --> 01:06:13.436
You gave us a theory,
not an explanation.


954
01:06:13.586 --> 01:06:15.036
Actually, two theories.

955
01:06:15.246 --> 01:06:18.336
With and without a deliberate push.

956
01:06:19.036 --> 01:06:20.706
According to your theories,

957
01:06:20.916 --> 01:06:22.956
what type of object was used?

958
01:06:23.126 --> 01:06:25.706
A heavy object, probably in metal

959
01:06:25.916 --> 01:06:27.876
or dense wood,

960
01:06:28.036 --> 01:06:30.246
and undoubtedly with a sharp edge.

961
01:06:30.786 --> 01:06:34.336
Did you examine any such objects
found on the premises?


962
01:06:34.496 --> 01:06:37.126
You know no weapon was found.

963
01:06:37.286 --> 01:06:39.086
They're easily disposed of.

964
01:06:39.706 --> 01:06:41.246
No further questions.

965
01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:46.336
Two possible explanations
for these 3 spatters.


966
01:06:46.496 --> 01:06:50.626
Either they came from here,
after a violent blow.


967
01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:54.036
Or they resulted when the skull

968
01:06:54.206 --> 01:06:55.876
hit this roof ledge,

969
01:06:56.086 --> 01:06:57.496
approximately here.

970
01:06:57.836 --> 01:06:59.666
The first hypothesis is unlikely.

971
01:06:59.836 --> 01:07:04.286
It's inconsistent with the shape
and movement of the spatters.


972
01:07:05.266 --> 01:07:07.056
Focusing on the second hypothesis,

973
01:07:07.206 --> 01:07:10.956
we must take into account
the bounce caused by the impact


974
01:07:11.126 --> 01:07:12.456
on the roof ledge.

975
01:07:13.286 --> 01:07:16.456
I'll show you a video
of our in-situ tests.


976
01:07:21.976 --> 01:07:22.886
There.

977
01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:26.706
As you can see
in our reenactment with a dummy,


978
01:07:26.936 --> 01:07:30.056
such an impact
causes the body to turn abruptly.


979
01:07:30.206 --> 01:07:33.666
And during that rollover, or spin,

980
01:07:34.036 --> 01:07:36.166
a fraction of a second after impact,

981
01:07:36.336 --> 01:07:40.206
these 3 spatters are projected

982
01:07:40.436 --> 01:07:41.886
onto this surface.

983
01:07:45.496 --> 01:07:47.286
The only valid explanation

984
01:07:47.456 --> 01:07:50.996
is that Mr. Maleski
fell from the attic window.


985
01:07:51.166 --> 01:07:52.456
I believe it's the only way

986
01:07:52.666 --> 01:07:54.956
he could've bounced off the roof,

987
01:07:55.436 --> 01:07:57.016
and sustained such an injury.

988
01:07:57.166 --> 01:07:59.536
You use the cautious qualifier
"I believe".


989
01:07:59.706 --> 01:08:00.996
So it's your opinion.

990
01:08:01.586 --> 01:08:04.336
How do you explain
the lack of DNA or trace tissue


991
01:08:04.536 --> 01:08:07.916
at the point of impact,
or "bounce" as you call it?


992
01:08:08.416 --> 01:08:09.996
I'll show you.

993
01:08:10.166 --> 01:08:12.286
This is a test we carried out

994
01:08:12.516 --> 01:08:14.596
under comparable conditions.

995
01:08:14.746 --> 01:08:17.916
At the time of the incident,
there was a layer of ice


996
01:08:18.086 --> 01:08:20.746
underneath a thick layer of snow.

997
01:08:21.956 --> 01:08:25.126
We see the snow melting
in acceleration.


998
01:08:25.286 --> 01:08:26.626
And we can see,

999
01:08:26.786 --> 01:08:30.706
during 1 hour and 50 minutes,
that the runoff


1000
01:08:31.206 --> 01:08:34.836
takes with it all residue
embedded at the point of impact.


1001
01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:36.706
It ends up with the blood
that was already


1002
01:08:36.806 --> 01:08:37.886
down here.

1003
01:08:38.036 --> 01:08:41.666
You call the violent blow hypothesis
"improbable".


1004
01:08:41.836 --> 01:08:43.786
Would you call it impossible?

1005
01:08:45.086 --> 01:08:46.956
No, but highly improbable.

1006
01:08:47.126 --> 01:08:48.786
Meaning it is possible.

1007
01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:51.956
As it's possible
I'll be president someday.


1008
01:08:52.186 --> 01:08:53.556
I know the definition.

1009
01:08:53.706 --> 01:08:55.166
It's improbable for a reason.

1010
01:08:55.336 --> 01:08:58.496
In your hypothesis,
in order to explain the angle


1011
01:08:58.726 --> 01:09:00.136
of these 3 spatters,

1012
01:09:00.286 --> 01:09:03.666
we have to imagine
that Mr. Maleski's head


1013
01:09:03.836 --> 01:09:07.376
was leaning way out,
around 80 cm past the guardrail.


1014
01:09:07.536 --> 01:09:10.496
This implies the aggressor forced him

1015
01:09:10.706 --> 01:09:12.706
to lean backwards over the void,

1016
01:09:13.286 --> 01:09:15.746
shoving him against the guardrail,

1017
01:09:15.916 --> 01:09:18.916
his entire torso pitched backwards.

1018
01:09:19.246 --> 01:09:23.586
The aggressor would have
to be leaning very far out


1019
01:09:23.786 --> 01:09:26.166
while holding a heavy object

1020
01:09:26.336 --> 01:09:29.496
and striking the victim
with powerful momentum.


1021
01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:30.956
All these elements,

1022
01:09:31.126 --> 01:09:33.996
in addition to
the defendant's body mass,


1023
01:09:34.166 --> 01:09:36.336
make this hypothesis highly improbable.

1024
01:09:36.496 --> 01:09:37.666
But not impossible.

1025
01:09:42.086 --> 01:09:45.206
Listen Daniel,
I asked to see you because...


1026
01:09:45.376 --> 01:09:48.626
I know you have a vested interest
in this case.


1027
01:09:48.786 --> 01:09:51.496
I've allowed you
to attend the trial so far.


1028
01:09:51.666 --> 01:09:53.036
But tomorrow will be

1029
01:09:53.266 --> 01:09:55.056
far more complicated.

1030
01:09:55.206 --> 01:09:57.996
We'll be covering
some disturbing details,


1031
01:09:58.166 --> 01:10:00.666
so I've decided
you won't be attending.


1032
01:10:01.786 --> 01:10:03.456
I think I can hear anything.

1033
01:10:03.626 --> 01:10:04.456
What?

1034
01:10:04.626 --> 01:10:06.586
I think I can hear anything.

1035
01:10:06.996 --> 01:10:08.786
- Yeah?
- I'm prepared.


1036
01:10:08.956 --> 01:10:12.036
You can hear it,
but can you handle it?


1037
01:10:12.206 --> 01:10:13.786
We have a job to do.

1038
01:10:13.956 --> 01:10:17.536
We need to be able to work...
with serenity.


1039
01:10:17.706 --> 01:10:19.336
I've never disrupted the trial.

1040
01:10:19.496 --> 01:10:20.996
Disrupted...

1041
01:10:21.336 --> 01:10:23.036
That's not the point.

1042
01:10:24.376 --> 01:10:27.666
We need to be able
to evoke the facts bluntly.


1043
01:10:28.916 --> 01:10:30.996
We have to address everything,

1044
01:10:31.166 --> 01:10:33.536
without fear of hurting you.

1045
01:10:36.246 --> 01:10:37.996
I've already been hurt.

1046
01:10:39.706 --> 01:10:41.916
And that's why I need...

1047
01:10:43.286 --> 01:10:45.456
to hear, so I can get past it.

1048
01:10:45.626 --> 01:10:47.746
The trial is not about you hearing.

1049
01:10:47.916 --> 01:10:50.286
It's about establishing the truth,

1050
01:10:50.456 --> 01:10:53.206
without being forced
to censor ourselves.


1051
01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:56.166
When has anyone
censored themselves?


1052
01:10:57.356 --> 01:11:00.016
Even if you forbid me to come,

1053
01:11:00.416 --> 01:11:02.956
I'll find out.
I'll know what happened


1054
01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:04.956
from TV, radio, internet.

1055
01:11:05.836 --> 01:11:07.456
I'll be obsessed.

1056
01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:21.376
Mrs Voyter, you claim

1057
01:11:21.586 --> 01:11:24.916
your husband attempted suicide

1058
01:11:25.286 --> 01:11:28.456
You remembered late,
which is quite surprising.


1059
01:11:28.626 --> 01:11:31.586
Can you describe
the episode in detail?


1060
01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:32.916
Yes.

1061
01:11:38.746 --> 01:11:43.246
It happened a few weeks
after he stopped his medication.


1062
01:11:44.376 --> 01:11:46.876
I found him lying on the floor...

1063
01:11:47.916 --> 01:11:50.246
early in the morning, in his room.

1064
01:11:51.996 --> 01:11:53.166
He'd...

1065
01:11:53.536 --> 01:11:55.286
had a lot to drink..

1066
01:11:56.036 --> 01:11:58.746
The night before, and passed out.

1067
01:12:00.336 --> 01:12:03.746
He'd vomited,
and in the vomit, I saw aspirin.


1068
01:12:04.626 --> 01:12:07.996
The pills had nearly dissolved.

1069
01:12:10.086 --> 01:12:12.876
At first I didn't understand
what it was.


1070
01:12:13.626 --> 01:12:16.086
But later, I found...

1071
01:12:16.786 --> 01:12:19.586
empty blister packs
in the kitchen garbage.


1072
01:12:20.706 --> 01:12:23.336
I cleaned it all up
and put him in bed.


1073
01:12:23.916 --> 01:12:25.166
Later,

1074
01:12:25.336 --> 01:12:26.956
when he felt better,

1075
01:12:27.166 --> 01:12:29.086
he didn't want to discuss it.

1076
01:12:29.246 --> 01:12:32.036
He just said he'd
stopped his meds too soon.


1077
01:12:33.706 --> 01:12:35.666
You had separate bedrooms?

1078
01:12:36.666 --> 01:12:40.086
It was his office,
and he usually slept there, yes.


1079
01:12:41.746 --> 01:12:46.036
I see. What made you
go into his room so early?


1080
01:12:46.206 --> 01:12:48.746
I wake up very early.
He did too, sometimes.


1081
01:12:48.916 --> 01:12:52.166
We occasionally spent that time
together, talking.


1082
01:12:52.336 --> 01:12:53.746
At 6 in the morning?

1083
01:12:53.916 --> 01:12:56.376
Yes, if I saw the light on. Yes.

1084
01:12:57.166 --> 01:13:00.246
We'd stopped sharing a bed,
but we were very close.


1085
01:13:00.416 --> 01:13:02.246
I would often...

1086
01:13:03.336 --> 01:13:06.336
finish the night with him,
in the office bed.


1087
01:13:07.836 --> 01:13:09.746
I'd gone down to make coffee.

1088
01:13:09.916 --> 01:13:12.916
I saw his door was ajar, and...

1089
01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:15.496
I saw him lying on the floor.

1090
01:13:15.916 --> 01:13:18.086
No one else witnessed that?

1091
01:13:18.206 --> 01:13:19.206
No.

1092
01:13:19.536 --> 01:13:21.956
Thank you, you may sit down.

1093
01:13:24.246 --> 01:13:25.626
Did you know that?

1094
01:13:27.416 --> 01:13:29.166
Which antidepressant
did you prescribe?


1095
01:13:29.336 --> 01:13:31.086
Escitalopram, 20 mg per day.

1096
01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:33.336
- Was it his choice to stop?
- Yes.


1097
01:13:33.746 --> 01:13:36.956
About 7 months before he died
he wanted to wean off.


1098
01:13:37.126 --> 01:13:40.916
I recommended a tapering plan
with weekly check-ins.


1099
01:13:41.086 --> 01:13:42.586
Any suicidal ideation?

1100
01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:45.246
No, Samuel wasn't depressive.

1101
01:13:45.416 --> 01:13:48.586
I'd prescribed Escitalopram
as an emotional shield


1102
01:13:49.416 --> 01:13:52.126
to help him cope
after his son's accident.


1103
01:13:52.286 --> 01:13:56.746
Can sudden withdrawal from a low dose
trigger a suicide attempt?


1104
01:13:57.606 --> 01:13:59.856
Anything's possible in theory,

1105
01:13:59.996 --> 01:14:04.246
but why would he have asked me
to help him wean off,


1106
01:14:04.416 --> 01:14:07.336
then stop behind my back?
Makes no sense.


1107
01:14:07.496 --> 01:14:10.336
And no mention of it
in our weekly sessions?


1108
01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:26.626
Have you ever had a patient
commit suicide,


1109
01:14:26.856 --> 01:14:28.476
or attempt suicide?

1110
01:14:28.626 --> 01:14:30.876
In French, "committing suicide"

1111
01:14:31.036 --> 01:14:34.666
means both trying and succeeding.

1112
01:14:34.896 --> 01:14:35.896
It's the action.

1113
01:14:36.036 --> 01:14:37.706
Thanks for the language lesson.

1114
01:14:38.186 --> 01:14:39.636
No patient has committed suicide.

1115
01:14:39.786 --> 01:14:42.126
Aside from Mr. Maleski,

1116
01:14:42.286 --> 01:14:44.836
since we're here
to rule on the question.


1117
01:14:44.996 --> 01:14:46.286
In any case,

1118
01:14:46.456 --> 01:14:49.246
we can't consider you
an expert on suicide,


1119
01:14:49.416 --> 01:14:50.586
failed or successful.

1120
01:14:51.336 --> 01:14:54.746
You said your husband
refused to discuss it with you,


1121
01:14:54.916 --> 01:14:56.666
or anyone else, apparently.

1122
01:14:56.836 --> 01:14:58.126
Why, do you think?

1123
01:15:00.586 --> 01:15:02.166
Because he was ashamed.

1124
01:15:02.336 --> 01:15:04.586
He had a lot of...

1125
01:15:09.286 --> 01:15:11.536
It's too complicated.
Can I change the language, please?


1126
01:15:13.126 --> 01:15:14.376
Thanks.

1127
01:15:16.286 --> 01:15:18.376
Yeah, I think because he was ashamed.

1128
01:15:19.566 --> 01:15:22.606
Samuel had
a lot of issues with shame.


1129
01:15:22.806 --> 01:15:24.136
It's complicated.

1130
01:15:27.246 --> 01:15:31.246
He was frustrated with teaching.
It had become a burden,


1131
01:15:31.956 --> 01:15:33.626
and he wanted to write.

1132
01:15:34.416 --> 01:15:36.536
He'd been working
on a novel for years,


1133
01:15:36.706 --> 01:15:38.836
before and after Daniel's accident.

1134
01:15:40.456 --> 01:15:41.746
I read everything he wrote.

1135
01:15:41.916 --> 01:15:44.206
I thought it was really good
and I told him so.


1136
01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:46.626
But from one day to another,
he just...


1137
01:15:47.166 --> 01:15:49.786
couldn't do it anymore,
he just stopped.


1138
01:15:51.286 --> 01:15:53.376
It made him feel like a coward.

1139
01:15:54.166 --> 01:15:56.286
He would belittle himself.

1140
01:15:57.706 --> 01:16:00.496
He ended up convincing himself
he could not write


1141
01:16:00.666 --> 01:16:03.666
because of his dependency
on the medication.


1142
01:16:03.836 --> 01:16:05.666
He wanted to free himself of that,

1143
01:16:05.836 --> 01:16:08.126
and he could not, of course not...

1144
01:16:08.286 --> 01:16:09.916
I'm sorry, I'm not finished.

1145
01:16:10.086 --> 01:16:12.726
He could not talk about
the suicide attempt


1146
01:16:12.836 --> 01:16:16.286
because his feelings of failure
were just too painful.


1147
01:16:16.456 --> 01:16:18.166
He never spoke of that.

1148
01:16:18.336 --> 01:16:19.336
Not once.

1149
01:16:19.376 --> 01:16:23.166
He blamed you for getting him hooked
on the pills from the first session.


1150
01:16:23.336 --> 01:16:24.456
It drove him mad.

1151
01:16:24.666 --> 01:16:26.166
He and I decided together.

1152
01:16:26.336 --> 01:16:29.836
You can't deny you're at the center
of this equation.


1153
01:16:30.246 --> 01:16:33.666
Samuel came to see me
because he felt guilty,


1154
01:16:33.836 --> 01:16:36.496
but mostly because you blamed him.

1155
01:16:36.666 --> 01:16:39.086
He described your behavior

1156
01:16:39.246 --> 01:16:41.336
as quite castrating.

1157
01:16:41.746 --> 01:16:43.706
You made him pay

1158
01:16:44.036 --> 01:16:45.786
for the accident

1159
01:16:45.996 --> 01:16:49.416
by forcing him to give up
what mattered most to him:


1160
01:16:49.586 --> 01:16:50.626
Writing.

1161
01:16:51.456 --> 01:16:54.876
You put him on
an emotional roller coaster.


1162
01:16:55.086 --> 01:16:57.246
On the one hand, it's true,

1163
01:16:57.416 --> 01:17:00.336
you encouraged him to write,
wanted him to succeed.


1164
01:17:00.496 --> 01:17:03.916
But if he had,
it would've been unbearable for you.


1165
01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:06.916
That's the problem.
It may have been subconscious.


1166
01:17:08.086 --> 01:17:11.416
All the material
and psychological burdens


1167
01:17:11.586 --> 01:17:14.126
resulting from the accident
were his to bear.


1168
01:17:14.286 --> 01:17:17.206
It's as though you said,
"This is your problem."


1169
01:17:17.376 --> 01:17:19.376
"You're responsible. 
Deal with it."

1170
01:17:19.536 --> 01:17:22.376
"I want to free myself from that,
to write."


1171
01:17:22.536 --> 01:17:24.126
Material burdens

1172
01:17:24.286 --> 01:17:27.416
were managed by Mrs Voyter
as much as her husband.


1173
01:17:27.586 --> 01:17:30.996
We have their bank statements,
receipts, etc.


1174
01:17:31.206 --> 01:17:33.836
I'm also talking about
the emotional load.


1175
01:17:33.996 --> 01:17:36.706
Responsibilities, sense of purpose,

1176
01:17:37.376 --> 01:17:38.586
anxiety.

1177
01:17:38.746 --> 01:17:43.166
In those areas,
Samuel felt an unbearable imbalance.


1178
01:17:43.336 --> 01:17:45.706
So what your patients
tell you is the truth?


1179
01:17:45.876 --> 01:17:47.996
As a psychoanalyst,

1180
01:17:48.166 --> 01:17:50.876
you never wondered
whether Samuel Maleski


1181
01:17:51.036 --> 01:17:54.746
might've needed to imagine
an unbearable imbalance


1182
01:17:54.916 --> 01:17:56.916
to prevent himself from writing?

1183
01:17:57.086 --> 01:18:01.086
After a while, I can tell
what's real and what isn't.


1184
01:18:01.286 --> 01:18:02.496
Lucky you.

1185
01:18:02.666 --> 01:18:04.416
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1186
01:18:04.836 --> 01:18:06.126
But...

1187
01:18:06.496 --> 01:18:08.916
I don't know. You come here,

1188
01:18:09.086 --> 01:18:12.536
OK, with maybe your opinion,
and you tell me


1189
01:18:13.626 --> 01:18:17.456
who Samuel was
and what we were going through.


1190
01:18:18.126 --> 01:18:21.456
But what you say is just

1191
01:18:22.036 --> 01:18:25.036
a little part of the whole situation.

1192
01:18:25.586 --> 01:18:26.706
You know.

1193
01:18:27.286 --> 01:18:28.666
I mean, sometimes,

1194
01:18:29.336 --> 01:18:30.706
sometimes a couple...

1195
01:18:32.286 --> 01:18:34.126
is kind of a chaos

1196
01:18:34.286 --> 01:18:36.286
and everybody is lost.

1197
01:18:36.456 --> 01:18:39.246
Sometimes we fight together
and sometimes we fight alone,


1198
01:18:39.416 --> 01:18:42.666
and sometimes we fight against
each other, that happens.


1199
01:18:42.836 --> 01:18:45.836
And I think it's possible that Samuel

1200
01:18:46.166 --> 01:18:49.876
needed to see things
the way you describe them, but...


1201
01:18:51.416 --> 01:18:53.416
If I'd been seeing a therapist,

1202
01:18:53.586 --> 01:18:57.666
he could stand here too and say
very ugly things about Samuel.


1203
01:18:57.836 --> 01:18:59.836
But would those things be true?

1204
01:19:08.496 --> 01:19:12.746
Did you resent your husband
after your son's accident?


1205
01:19:16.286 --> 01:19:18.496
We were both dealing with

1206
01:19:18.666 --> 01:19:21.786
very different emotions at that time.

1207
01:19:23.126 --> 01:19:24.706
Yes or no?

1208
01:19:27.456 --> 01:19:29.036
Yes, for a few days.

1209
01:19:29.536 --> 01:19:31.416
Daniel was on his watch.

1210
01:19:32.586 --> 01:19:35.456
Your son practically lost his sight,

1211
01:19:35.836 --> 01:19:38.286
and you only resented him
for a few days?


1212
01:19:39.416 --> 01:19:42.786
Yes, about his responsibility
for the accident. Yes.


1213
01:19:43.706 --> 01:19:44.876
Of course.

1214
01:19:45.916 --> 01:19:50.996
I mean, maybe. The doctor earlier said
something about a tragic situation.


1215
01:19:51.416 --> 01:19:54.416
I immediately refused
to see it that way.


1216
01:19:54.786 --> 01:19:57.456
I never saw Daniel as handicapped.

1217
01:19:58.286 --> 01:20:01.626
You know, I wanted to protect
him from that perception.


1218
01:20:01.786 --> 01:20:05.456
Because, as soon as you mark a child
that way, you condemn him to now


1219
01:20:05.626 --> 01:20:08.376
to not see his life as his own,

1220
01:20:08.536 --> 01:20:11.246
whereas he should feel
that it's his best life


1221
01:20:11.416 --> 01:20:13.036
because it's the only life he's got,

1222
01:20:13.206 --> 01:20:14.536
it is his own.

1223
01:20:16.836 --> 01:20:18.206
He reads books,

1224
01:20:19.286 --> 01:20:21.746
he goes on social media
like any other kid


1225
01:20:21.916 --> 01:20:23.286
he plays the piano,

1226
01:20:23.456 --> 01:20:25.376
he dreams, he cries, he laughs.

1227
01:20:25.536 --> 01:20:27.536
He's a very lively kid.

1228
01:20:27.876 --> 01:20:29.086
He's OK.

1229
01:20:30.166 --> 01:20:31.336
Yeah.

1230
01:20:33.456 --> 01:20:35.746
So perhaps, I...

1231
01:20:37.376 --> 01:20:41.536
I resented Samuel for projecting
his own pain onto Daniel, yes.


1232
01:20:44.496 --> 01:20:45.496
Thank you.

1233
01:21:06.246 --> 01:21:08.376
I want to drink all night.

1234
01:21:09.706 --> 01:21:10.876
Yeah, same.

1235
01:21:11.706 --> 01:21:12.996
I will drink.

1236
01:21:13.746 --> 01:21:14.876
To forget.

1237
01:21:15.086 --> 01:21:17.166
Come on. You're the only lawyer...

1238
01:21:19.706 --> 01:21:20.956
OK, once again.

1239
01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:23.666
No, you're really
the only lawyer I know.


1240
01:21:25.126 --> 01:21:28.626
Is it a great reason for putting
your life in someone's hands?


1241
01:21:29.036 --> 01:21:30.916
- Is it?
- No, but you're good too.


1242
01:21:31.496 --> 01:21:33.086
Right? You're good.

1243
01:21:33.246 --> 01:21:34.706
- I don't know.
- Oh, come on.


1244
01:21:36.706 --> 01:21:38.206
You look like a dog.

1245
01:21:39.496 --> 01:21:40.666
Excuse me?

1246
01:21:40.836 --> 01:21:42.586
No, a beautiful dog.

1247
01:21:43.586 --> 01:21:44.916
How do you say it?

1248
01:21:45.956 --> 01:21:47.536
A basset?

1249
01:21:47.706 --> 01:21:49.836
Funny you say that.
I can't trust someone


1250
01:21:50.036 --> 01:21:52.416
if I can't put
an animal's head on them.


1251
01:21:52.626 --> 01:21:54.786
Really? So what am I?

1252
01:21:57.626 --> 01:21:59.086
I'm not sure yet.

1253
01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:04.036
After all this time,

1254
01:22:04.876 --> 01:22:06.376
you still don't know?

1255
01:22:08.786 --> 01:22:10.126
OK.

1256
01:22:21.746 --> 01:22:25.706
Do you remember me from before,
when we first met?


1257
01:22:26.246 --> 01:22:27.586
Yes I do, of course.

1258
01:22:28.336 --> 01:22:30.376
I don't. What was I like?

1259
01:22:32.376 --> 01:22:34.876
You were a little bit lost,

1260
01:22:35.706 --> 01:22:37.336
as I can remember.

1261
01:22:38.536 --> 01:22:39.586
Lonely.

1262
01:22:40.626 --> 01:22:41.706
And..

1263
01:22:42.956 --> 01:22:44.086
Ambitious.

1264
01:22:45.336 --> 01:22:47.746
And I was hopelessly in love.

1265
01:22:55.706 --> 01:22:57.206
I can't remember a thing.

1266
01:23:00.376 --> 01:23:01.706
OK.

1267
01:23:09.126 --> 01:23:11.416
But I'm innocent.
You know that, right?


1268
01:23:11.746 --> 01:23:13.036
Yes.

1269
01:23:13.376 --> 01:23:14.746
I mean really.

1270
01:23:17.916 --> 01:23:19.876
I don't know what you're thinking.

1271
01:23:22.496 --> 01:23:25.376
I think a lot of things
I don't tell you.


1272
01:23:25.836 --> 01:23:27.336
Otherwise you'd fire me right now.

1273
01:23:27.456 --> 01:23:28.456
No, Vincent.

1274
01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:30.536
In your head, you're thinking...

1275
01:23:30.706 --> 01:23:34.036
Sometimes when you look at me,
just like right now,


1276
01:23:34.416 --> 01:23:36.336
I can feel that you're judging me.

1277
01:23:37.836 --> 01:23:39.706
I don't know what you think.

1278
01:23:40.036 --> 01:23:42.036
Sandra, I believe you.

1279
01:23:42.746 --> 01:23:44.146
I'm not judging you.

1280
01:24:05.336 --> 01:24:06.376
My love,

1281
01:24:07.586 --> 01:24:08.916
I just want you to know...

1282
01:24:09.536 --> 01:24:10.626
I'm not...

1283
01:24:11.206 --> 01:24:14.586
I'm not that monster, you know?

1284
01:24:15.536 --> 01:24:17.916
Everything you hear in the trial,

1285
01:24:19.126 --> 01:24:20.586
it's just...

1286
01:24:22.036 --> 01:24:23.956
It's twisted. You know.

1287
01:24:24.836 --> 01:24:25.836
And...

1288
01:24:25.876 --> 01:24:27.706
It wasn't like that.

1289
01:24:28.286 --> 01:24:29.376
Your father...

1290
01:24:29.996 --> 01:24:32.246
Your father was my soulmate.

1291
01:24:32.876 --> 01:24:35.626
We chose each other, and I loved him.

1292
01:24:39.126 --> 01:24:40.996
But how do you prove that?

1293
01:24:46.876 --> 01:24:51.036
I just wish you would be shielded
from all this, that you could do...


1294
01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:55.456
that you could do children's stuff,

1295
01:24:56.166 --> 01:24:59.206
that you could be a child
just a little longer. You know.


1296
01:25:14.586 --> 01:25:15.876
All rise!

1297
01:25:24.536 --> 01:25:26.336
You may be seated.

1298
01:25:28.206 --> 01:25:32.786
We'll begin by calling the
Chief Investigator to the bar.


1299
01:25:37.586 --> 01:25:39.286
He insists, it's important.

1300
01:26:25.536 --> 01:26:27.336
You may be seated.

1301
01:26:29.496 --> 01:26:31.916
The Chief Investigator
has surely arrived,


1302
01:26:32.086 --> 01:26:34.286
so we'll start with him.

1303
01:26:35.336 --> 01:26:38.876
Clerk, please cue Exhibit 31.

1304
01:26:41.036 --> 01:26:44.126
Bailiff, prepare to hand out

1305
01:26:44.286 --> 01:26:47.996
the transcription
of the recording to the jurors.


1306
01:26:54.836 --> 01:26:56.126
Clerk?

1307
01:26:57.456 --> 01:26:59.586
What can I do?
It's part of the job.


1308
01:26:59.746 --> 01:27:01.786
Organize yourself differently.

1309
01:27:01.956 --> 01:27:03.206
I'm not going to cancel.

1310
01:27:03.376 --> 01:27:05.166
How can I organize on my own?

1311
01:27:05.536 --> 01:27:07.876
You know
we have to plan things together.


1312
01:27:10.746 --> 01:27:13.166
I won't leave Daniel alone
because you're gone.


1313
01:27:13.336 --> 01:27:15.536
Leave him with Monica,
what's the big deal?


1314
01:27:16.416 --> 01:27:17.416
Three days a week?

1315
01:27:17.586 --> 01:27:19.206
We'd have to pay her for that.

1316
01:27:19.376 --> 01:27:20.916
We can't afford it.

1317
01:27:23.786 --> 01:27:25.246
I need time.

1318
01:27:25.456 --> 01:27:27.336
Not just a few hours.

1319
01:27:27.956 --> 01:27:30.666
I'm talking about blocking out time
for myself for the whole year.


1320
01:27:31.746 --> 01:27:33.496
This isn't working for me anymore.

1321
01:27:37.706 --> 01:27:40.376
Organize your time differently,
it's up to you.


1322
01:27:40.536 --> 01:27:43.206
When's the last time
you helped him do his homework?


1323
01:27:43.416 --> 01:27:47.086
So many things you don't care about.
That's the time I mean.


1324
01:27:48.206 --> 01:27:51.836
Darling, the book just came out.
You know it's just this time.


1325
01:27:51.996 --> 01:27:54.496
It's always "just this time".

1326
01:27:56.626 --> 01:27:59.786
Whether you have a book out,
or you're writing,


1327
01:27:59.956 --> 01:28:03.036
or you need space
to figure out what to write.


1328
01:28:05.376 --> 01:28:08.036
I've been following
your lead for years!


1329
01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:10.996
I can't do anything with my time.

1330
01:28:11.536 --> 01:28:12.606
Do you understand?

1331
01:28:16.496 --> 01:28:18.876
It's not my time, it's yours!

1332
01:28:23.376 --> 01:28:26.166
Do I force you to teach?

1333
01:28:27.916 --> 01:28:30.876
Do I force you
to homeschool Daniel?


1334
01:28:31.626 --> 01:28:33.126
No one's forcing you.

1335
01:28:33.536 --> 01:28:35.916
If you want more time,
I've never stopped you.


1336
01:28:36.086 --> 01:28:37.536
Are you fucking serious?

1337
01:28:38.496 --> 01:28:41.166
I cut my course load in half
to gain more time


1338
01:28:41.336 --> 01:28:42.836
and it's still not enough.

1339
01:28:42.996 --> 01:28:45.836
I have to finish the renovation,
and I'm dealing with everything else!


1340
01:28:48.286 --> 01:28:50.746
Why do you refuse to talk about it?

1341
01:28:50.916 --> 01:28:54.536
Why can't you just admit it has to do
with how things are divided between us?


1342
01:28:54.706 --> 01:28:55.876
Because you're wrong.

1343
01:28:56.036 --> 01:28:58.786
I don't owe you any time.
I do my part.


1344
01:28:59.376 --> 01:29:02.376
Come on, let's not
take inventory here, please.


1345
01:29:03.536 --> 01:29:04.746
Let's relax.

1346
01:29:11.536 --> 01:29:12.746
I love you.

1347
01:29:19.536 --> 01:29:22.246
When you decided
to homeschool Daniel,


1348
01:29:22.476 --> 01:29:24.136
I told you be careful.

1349
01:29:24.836 --> 01:29:27.456
It's a beautiful, generous choice.
I thank you for it,


1350
01:29:27.626 --> 01:29:30.376
but you don't have to.
I told you it would force you...


1351
01:29:30.536 --> 01:29:33.746
What?
To spend more time with my son?


1352
01:29:35.376 --> 01:29:36.666
I'm glad I did.

1353
01:29:37.876 --> 01:29:40.996
I wouldn't have the relationship
I have with him today if I didn't.


1354
01:29:44.086 --> 01:29:47.086
The relationship
I don't have with him, you mean?


1355
01:29:47.246 --> 01:29:49.246
I didn't say that, no.

1356
01:29:53.836 --> 01:29:55.206
I'm saying maybe,

1357
01:29:57.036 --> 01:30:00.206
just maybe, things are a little
out of balance between us.


1358
01:30:00.376 --> 01:30:03.036
I want you to look at that.
Why is this so hard to discuss?


1359
01:30:03.206 --> 01:30:05.836
I don't believe in the notion
of reciprocity in a couple.


1360
01:30:05.996 --> 01:30:07.786
It's naïve and frankly, depressing.

1361
01:30:08.666 --> 01:30:12.336
Yes. And I think
discussing it is a waste of time,


1362
01:30:12.496 --> 01:30:14.746
considering the state
you're in. Seriously.


1363
01:30:15.706 --> 01:30:18.166
All this blah-blah-blah,
and more time is gone.


1364
01:30:19.286 --> 01:30:20.786
All this time spent chitchatting

1365
01:30:20.956 --> 01:30:23.416
could be spent in silence
doing whatever you want to do,


1366
01:30:23.586 --> 01:30:24.956
if only you knew.

1367
01:30:25.166 --> 01:30:27.956
I want time to start writing,
same as you.


1368
01:30:28.706 --> 01:30:29.706
Do it.

1369
01:30:29.786 --> 01:30:33.166
Writers don't stop writing
because they have a son and chores.


1370
01:30:33.336 --> 01:30:35.746
Stop whining about
your scheduling bullshit


1371
01:30:35.916 --> 01:30:39.666
and stop blaming me
for what you did or didn't do.


1372
01:30:39.836 --> 01:30:42.786
I live with you.
I plan my life around you.


1373
01:30:44.246 --> 01:30:47.086
If I imposed on you
what you're imposing on me,


1374
01:30:47.786 --> 01:30:49.536
neither of us would be able to write.

1375
01:30:49.706 --> 01:30:52.086
Don't worry about me,
I always manage to write.


1376
01:30:52.586 --> 01:30:53.706
Great.

1377
01:30:54.416 --> 01:30:55.416
Perfect.

1378
01:30:55.456 --> 01:30:57.456
If you're so sure of yourself, adapt.

1379
01:30:57.686 --> 01:31:00.056
I do adapt.
I take Daniel to school.


1380
01:31:00.376 --> 01:31:02.626
- Once a week.
- We have Monica on Tuesdays, come on.


1381
01:31:02.786 --> 01:31:04.496
Sandra, don't be dishonest.

1382
01:31:04.566 --> 01:31:07.106
- I'm not. You're the one nitpicking.
- I've given you too much.


1383
01:31:07.186 --> 01:31:09.556
Too much time,
too many concessions.


1384
01:31:09.706 --> 01:31:11.416
I want this time back.

1385
01:31:11.586 --> 01:31:13.286
And you owe it to me. Be fair!

1386
01:31:13.516 --> 01:31:15.766
I'm sorry, but no.
Are you insane?


1387
01:31:15.916 --> 01:31:17.376
I don't owe you anything.

1388
01:31:17.836 --> 01:31:18.836
Really.

1389
01:31:18.996 --> 01:31:20.956
This is about your relationship
with your son.


1390
01:31:21.026 --> 01:31:22.666
And to protect
yourself and your comfort,


1391
01:31:22.716 --> 01:31:25.416
because you got scared and
put yourself in that position.


1392
01:31:25.626 --> 01:31:29.126
It was your choice to come here
and start this renovation.


1393
01:31:29.286 --> 01:31:31.336
This is your own trap!

1394
01:31:32.206 --> 01:31:36.036
I don't take your time,
you waste it all on your own!


1395
01:31:36.246 --> 01:31:38.036
I want things to change now.

1396
01:31:38.206 --> 01:31:40.416
I want time to start writing again.

1397
01:31:40.586 --> 01:31:41.786
Great, go for it.

1398
01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:45.246
If you want my advice,
go back to the one you ditched.


1399
01:31:46.246 --> 01:31:49.536
That's your advice?
Go back to the book you plundered?


1400
01:31:50.336 --> 01:31:52.036
So now it's plundering.

1401
01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:54.376
We've discussed it.
You'd given up.


1402
01:31:55.806 --> 01:31:59.846
You took the book's best idea.
How am I supposed to go back to it?


1403
01:32:00.206 --> 01:32:02.166
Do you realize
how cynical that is of you?


1404
01:32:02.376 --> 01:32:04.836
Publish your own version,
say it inspired me,


1405
01:32:04.996 --> 01:32:06.166
I'll admit to it.

1406
01:32:06.626 --> 01:32:10.126
If something needs to be written,
someone has to write it. You know.


1407
01:32:10.336 --> 01:32:13.376
You have animal vision.
You pretend to be obliging, but...


1408
01:32:13.606 --> 01:32:17.396
Look at you.
Even your bullshit moralizing...


1409
01:32:17.536 --> 01:32:21.246
And this, really, is a way
for you to waste more time.


1410
01:32:21.416 --> 01:32:23.626
You should be flattered
that I was inspired by you.


1411
01:32:23.786 --> 01:32:26.036
This is life, things circulate.

1412
01:32:26.206 --> 01:32:27.376
Yes.

1413
01:32:28.206 --> 01:32:31.336
And frankly, I wish
you'd be inspired to plunder me.


1414
01:32:31.496 --> 01:32:34.126
You're not alone in your jungle,
but you impose everything.


1415
01:32:34.336 --> 01:32:37.126
You impose your rhythm,
your use of time,


1416
01:32:37.586 --> 01:32:38.626
even your language.

1417
01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:41.876
Even with language,
I meet you on your turf.


1418
01:32:42.036 --> 01:32:43.626
We speak English at home.

1419
01:32:43.786 --> 01:32:45.996
I'm not on my turf,
I don't speak my mother tongue.


1420
01:32:46.206 --> 01:32:48.456
Nor mine, though we live here.

1421
01:32:48.626 --> 01:32:50.876
Yes, it's a middle ground, in fact.

1422
01:32:51.626 --> 01:32:54.126
Because I'm not French,
you're not German.


1423
01:32:54.286 --> 01:32:57.586
We create a middle ground, so nobody
has to go to the other's turf.


1424
01:32:57.746 --> 01:33:01.586
This is what English is for.
Don't blame me for that.


1425
01:33:01.746 --> 01:33:04.746
But we live in France.
That's our reality.


1426
01:33:04.976 --> 01:33:07.866
Daniel hears you speak a language
that has nothing to do with his life,


1427
01:33:07.916 --> 01:33:11.206
just because you impose it on him,
like everything else.


1428
01:33:11.376 --> 01:33:13.286
We're on your turf, all the time.

1429
01:33:13.516 --> 01:33:15.056
Your country!

1430
01:33:15.836 --> 01:33:20.416
Every single day I have to accept
that we live in your hometown!


1431
01:33:20.836 --> 01:33:23.036
The people you grew up with
look down on me


1432
01:33:23.206 --> 01:33:26.126
whenever I don't make the effort
to smile at them.


1433
01:33:27.376 --> 01:33:30.916
You don't think me living here
counts as meeting you on your turf?


1434
01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:33.586
You never smile at anyone.

1435
01:33:34.626 --> 01:33:36.456
That's why you love me, right?

1436
01:33:36.626 --> 01:33:40.086
Because, if you wanted a stupid
bitch who grins at your friends,


1437
01:33:40.246 --> 01:33:42.246
you'd have picked someone else.

1438
01:33:47.206 --> 01:33:48.586
You really have no shame.

1439
01:33:48.746 --> 01:33:50.206
That's a superpower.

1440
01:33:50.376 --> 01:33:52.166
You see no one but yourself.

1441
01:33:52.336 --> 01:33:55.246
I see you very clearly,
just not as a victim.


1442
01:33:56.166 --> 01:33:57.206
You impose

1443
01:33:57.436 --> 01:34:01.016
your way of living, speaking, eating,

1444
01:34:01.226 --> 01:34:02.146
even fucking.

1445
01:34:02.206 --> 01:34:04.786
I could never get you to fuck
any other way.


1446
01:34:04.956 --> 01:34:07.876
Because you expect me to follow your
lead, that's your notion of a couple.


1447
01:34:07.996 --> 01:34:09.956
I don't believe it;
I don't believe it...


1448
01:34:10.126 --> 01:34:13.996
I don't have a notion, I don't
give a fuck about couples. Really.


1449
01:34:17.036 --> 01:34:19.376
So, you say I'm stopping you

1450
01:34:19.536 --> 01:34:21.706
from fucking the way you want.

1451
01:34:22.086 --> 01:34:23.496
- Seriously?
- Yes.


1452
01:34:23.876 --> 01:34:26.416
Who's been refusing
to fuck since the accident?


1453
01:34:26.586 --> 01:34:28.036
You know I meant before.

1454
01:34:28.206 --> 01:34:31.416
What did I ever
refuse to do sexually?


1455
01:34:34.206 --> 01:34:35.336
Everything.

1456
01:34:37.036 --> 01:34:39.836
Everything plus I have to accept
that you fuck other people.


1457
01:34:40.066 --> 01:34:41.686
I do not fuck other people.

1458
01:34:41.836 --> 01:34:42.836
Don't deny it.

1459
01:34:42.996 --> 01:34:46.336
Once, and you cling to it
in order to suffer!


1460
01:34:46.496 --> 01:34:49.456
- You cheated several times.
- You make yourself the victim!


1461
01:34:49.626 --> 01:34:52.416
I'm not a victim,
I'm a man who's been cheated on!


1462
01:34:52.586 --> 01:34:54.086
Plundered and cheated on.

1463
01:34:58.996 --> 01:35:02.206
I can live without sex,
but not forever.


1464
01:35:03.246 --> 01:35:05.746
So you blame me?
I'm the one frustrating you?


1465
01:35:05.976 --> 01:35:08.176
It's not about who's...

1466
01:35:08.876 --> 01:35:11.336
who's blaming who
or who's frustrating who.


1467
01:35:11.496 --> 01:35:13.996
The frustration is there
and we're both dealing with it.


1468
01:35:14.916 --> 01:35:18.286
Me personally
I refuse to rot inside,


1469
01:35:18.516 --> 01:35:19.556
so I find solutions.

1470
01:35:19.706 --> 01:35:22.786
At this point, sex was a question
of personal hygiene!


1471
01:35:23.246 --> 01:35:26.876
But you impose your solutions,
which are solutions for you only.


1472
01:35:27.036 --> 01:35:29.246
You don't give a shit
if it hurts me and Daniel.


1473
01:35:29.416 --> 01:35:32.246
You leave Daniel out of this.
This is not about him.


1474
01:35:32.416 --> 01:35:34.036
I do not impose anything on him.

1475
01:35:34.206 --> 01:35:36.206
You made us live here
among the goats.


1476
01:35:36.376 --> 01:35:38.536
You complain
about the life you chose!


1477
01:35:38.706 --> 01:35:40.286
You're not a victim.

1478
01:35:40.626 --> 01:35:42.376
Not at all!

1479
01:35:42.536 --> 01:35:46.246
Your generosity conceals
something dirtier and meaner.


1480
01:35:47.416 --> 01:35:50.336
You're incapable of facing
your ambitions and resent me for it.


1481
01:35:50.496 --> 01:35:54.626
But I didn't put you where you are.
I've nothing to do with it!


1482
01:35:55.036 --> 01:35:57.586
You're not sacrificing yourself,
as you say.


1483
01:35:57.746 --> 01:36:01.126
You choose to sit on the sidelines
because you're afraid!


1484
01:36:01.286 --> 01:36:03.166
Your pride makes your head explode

1485
01:36:03.336 --> 01:36:06.376
before you can even come up
with a germ of an idea!


1486
01:36:06.536 --> 01:36:09.166
You wake up at 40
needing someone to blame.


1487
01:36:09.336 --> 01:36:10.786
You're the one to blame!

1488
01:36:13.206 --> 01:36:15.876
You're petrified
by your own fucking standards


1489
01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:17.336
and fear of failure.

1490
01:36:17.496 --> 01:36:18.786
This is the truth.

1491
01:36:18.956 --> 01:36:21.246
You're smart.
I know you know I'm right.


1492
01:36:21.476 --> 01:36:24.556
And Daniel has nothing to do with it.
Stop it!


1493
01:36:29.286 --> 01:36:30.706
You're a monster.

1494
01:36:32.126 --> 01:36:34.246
Even Daniel says it,
with his own words.


1495
01:36:34.416 --> 01:36:36.536
Take that back,
you piece of shit.


1496
01:36:36.706 --> 01:36:39.536
He's told me countless times
how hard you are.


1497
01:36:39.706 --> 01:36:41.746
He's telling you
what you want to hear.


1498
01:36:41.916 --> 01:36:44.876
He can feel your guilt
and he's trying to reassure you,


1499
01:36:45.106 --> 01:36:46.476
don't you see that?

1500
01:36:46.626 --> 01:36:49.126
You've never stopped
feeling guilty about him!


1501
01:36:49.356 --> 01:36:50.606
You're cold-hearted.

1502
01:36:50.746 --> 01:36:51.836
You have no pity.

1503
01:36:51.996 --> 01:36:53.666
And you have
way too much for yourself.


1504
01:36:53.836 --> 01:36:56.746
I can't stand any more
of your fucking ice!


1505
01:36:59.206 --> 01:37:00.836
- You're violent!
- Yes, I am!


1506
01:37:29.626 --> 01:37:30.876
So...

1507
01:37:31.416 --> 01:37:34.996
Can you tell us
where you found this recording?


1508
01:37:36.916 --> 01:37:39.586
On a USB key belonging to the victim.

1509
01:37:39.746 --> 01:37:43.996
He made several dozen recordings
on his cellphone.


1510
01:37:44.746 --> 01:37:48.626
For 6 months, he'd been recording
moments from, his life.


1511
01:37:48.786 --> 01:37:50.666
For a literary project, apparently.

1512
01:37:50.876 --> 01:37:53.036
Did he transcribe all the recordings?

1513
01:37:53.206 --> 01:37:55.246
Yes, except this last argument.

1514
01:37:56.036 --> 01:37:59.626
Does your investigation link
this argument to his death?


1515
01:37:59.786 --> 01:38:03.416
Yes. They occurred 20 hours apart
and have common themes.


1516
01:38:03.586 --> 01:38:05.456
He criticizes her infidelity.

1517
01:38:05.626 --> 01:38:08.036
A pretty girl comes the next day.

1518
01:38:08.376 --> 01:38:10.786
A literature student,

1519
01:38:10.956 --> 01:38:13.916
to interview Sandra Voyter
about her books.


1520
01:38:14.706 --> 01:38:17.206
There must've been
tension in the air.


1521
01:38:17.376 --> 01:38:18.586
The two women

1522
01:38:18.786 --> 01:38:22.876
were enjoying themselves
while he worked hard upstairs.


1523
01:38:24.246 --> 01:38:28.086
The argument can be seen as
a dress rehearsal for the next day.


1524
01:38:28.246 --> 01:38:32.626
How do you interpret
the violent outbursts?


1525
01:38:33.086 --> 01:38:34.626
We hear blows.

1526
01:38:35.416 --> 01:38:38.666
A physical altercation,
the accused striking her husband.


1527
01:38:38.836 --> 01:38:42.456
What makes it possible for you
to reach that conclusion?


1528
01:38:43.336 --> 01:38:46.086
She seems to be
in a more intense state of rage.


1529
01:38:49.206 --> 01:38:51.956
- Sorry?
- Speak directly to the court.


1530
01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:55.496
She's clearly
in a more intense state of rage.


1531
01:38:56.996 --> 01:39:01.586
Her shouts at the end of the audio
are the last step


1532
01:39:01.746 --> 01:39:04.166
before the violence gets physical.

1533
01:39:04.586 --> 01:39:08.086
The confusion that follows
is hard to analyze, but...


1534
01:39:08.496 --> 01:39:11.626
we hear blows to
a body or a face,

1535
01:39:11.786 --> 01:39:14.456
and the muffled screams we hear

1536
01:39:14.626 --> 01:39:16.286
are Mr. Maleski's.

1537
01:39:16.456 --> 01:39:18.666
You mentioned
bruises on Mrs Voyter.


1538
01:39:18.836 --> 01:39:21.036
Show Exhibit 9, please.

1539
01:39:21.786 --> 01:39:25.126
This photo was taken
on the day her husband died.


1540
01:39:25.456 --> 01:39:26.876
How did she explain it?

1541
01:39:27.036 --> 01:39:30.746
She initially told us
she'd bumped into a kitchen counter.


1542
01:39:31.376 --> 01:39:34.456
We pointed out that the bruising
was around her wrist,


1543
01:39:34.666 --> 01:39:37.706
and looked a lot
like signs of a struggle.


1544
01:39:38.416 --> 01:39:41.036
Later, when we played her
the recording,


1545
01:39:41.206 --> 01:39:43.786
she admitted it had happened then,

1546
01:39:44.286 --> 01:39:45.956
during their brief struggle.

1547
01:39:46.126 --> 01:39:48.036
So you admit you lied?

1548
01:39:48.956 --> 01:39:50.086
Yes.

1549
01:39:50.706 --> 01:39:51.956
Because..

1550
01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:56.206
I was afraid
that if I mentioned it,


1551
01:39:57.126 --> 01:40:00.086
I knew it would make me a suspect
and I got scared.


1552
01:40:00.246 --> 01:40:03.166
And you didn't know
he'd recorded the fight.


1553
01:40:03.336 --> 01:40:04.666
So you lied twice.

1554
01:40:04.836 --> 01:40:08.376
About the bruises,
and by not mentioning the fight.


1555
01:40:08.536 --> 01:40:11.206
For me, it was just one lie.

1556
01:40:11.376 --> 01:40:15.536
Because, if I'd been honest about the
bruises, I'd have mentioned the argument.


1557
01:40:15.956 --> 01:40:18.376
I didn't want to be seen as guilty.

1558
01:40:18.586 --> 01:40:20.456
As no guilty person ever does.

1559
01:40:20.626 --> 01:40:23.036
Can we time the bruises exactly?

1560
01:40:23.206 --> 01:40:25.536
The doctor examined her
the following day.


1561
01:40:26.336 --> 01:40:30.586
It was too late to determine exactly
when they occurred.


1562
01:40:30.786 --> 01:40:32.336
So it's possible

1563
01:40:32.496 --> 01:40:36.416
a second fight caused the bruises
on the day Mr. Maleski died.


1564
01:40:45.786 --> 01:40:48.786
What do we hear
at the end of the argument?


1565
01:40:49.536 --> 01:40:51.786
The first sound of breaking glass

1566
01:40:51.956 --> 01:40:54.416
is me throwing a glass
against the wall.


1567
01:40:54.586 --> 01:40:57.126
A wine glass that was on the table.

1568
01:40:57.916 --> 01:41:02.376
After that, I went over to my husband
and I slapped him.


1569
01:41:02.996 --> 01:41:06.206
That's when he grabbed my wrist,
quite violently.


1570
01:41:06.376 --> 01:41:08.536
That's the struggling we can hear.

1571
01:41:09.126 --> 01:41:13.496
Just after, I tried to stop him from
throwing picture frames to the floor


1572
01:41:13.666 --> 01:41:15.706
but I couldn't,
so we hear them shattering.


1573
01:41:16.416 --> 01:41:18.536
Aside from that slap,
did you hit him?


1574
01:41:19.086 --> 01:41:20.206
No.

1575
01:41:21.536 --> 01:41:22.876
What we hear next

1576
01:41:23.036 --> 01:41:27.416
is Samuel repeatedly hitting himself
in the face and the head,


1577
01:41:28.086 --> 01:41:30.586
and then punching the wall.

1578
01:41:30.746 --> 01:41:32.586
You can still see the dent.

1579
01:41:33.376 --> 01:41:37.336
There are a few around the house,
it's not the first time he did that.


1580
01:41:37.876 --> 01:41:41.166
Years ago, he already broke a finger

1581
01:41:41.666 --> 01:41:44.036
punching the wall during an episode.

1582
01:41:46.086 --> 01:41:48.496
We have photos
of those dents in the wall.


1583
01:41:48.666 --> 01:41:49.666
Thank you.

1584
01:41:49.856 --> 01:41:50.606
Here.

1585
01:41:50.746 --> 01:41:52.996
And the X-ray
of his fractured finger,


1586
01:41:53.206 --> 01:41:56.836
taken in June 2017
at the hospital in Grenoble.


1587
01:41:58.066 --> 01:41:59.356
Is it fair to say

1588
01:41:59.496 --> 01:42:04.336
your depiction of the violence
is interpretive and not objective?


1589
01:42:06.126 --> 01:42:08.786
She repeatedly lied to us,
so believing her...


1590
01:42:08.996 --> 01:42:10.836
Thus, this is about believing,

1591
01:42:10.996 --> 01:42:12.376
or not believing.

1592
01:42:12.706 --> 01:42:14.586
It's a subjective opinion,

1593
01:42:14.746 --> 01:42:16.996
based on an ambiguous recording.

1594
01:42:17.956 --> 01:42:20.836
You link the argument
of the day of the death.


1595
01:42:20.996 --> 01:42:23.706
You call it a "dress rehearsal".

1596
01:42:23.876 --> 01:42:25.666
Do you have any direct proof?

1597
01:42:25.836 --> 01:42:28.876
The recording
is direct proof of a fight.


1598
01:42:29.036 --> 01:42:30.836
I mean the day of the death.

1599
01:42:31.996 --> 01:42:35.246
With no witnesses or confessions,
we must interpret.


1600
01:42:37.876 --> 01:42:40.996
In fact, this violent fight is...

1601
01:42:41.166 --> 01:42:44.246
phantasmal.
It exists only as fantasy.


1602
01:42:44.876 --> 01:42:46.336
You float the idea,

1603
01:42:46.496 --> 01:42:48.166
the prosecutor floats it,

1604
01:42:48.336 --> 01:42:51.126
over or around the facts,

1605
01:42:51.286 --> 01:42:54.626
making it omnipresent
here in court, but...


1606
01:42:56.456 --> 01:42:59.626
We risk turning this fantasy
into a reality


1607
01:42:59.786 --> 01:43:03.126
simply because
there was indeed a fight


1608
01:43:03.496 --> 01:43:06.206
the day before Mr. Maleski died.

1609
01:43:06.746 --> 01:43:10.626
Don't substitute the day before
for the next day.


1610
01:43:11.836 --> 01:43:15.496
We can't fill the blanks
with a supposition,


1611
01:43:15.666 --> 01:43:19.416
simply because we have sounds
for one and not the other.


1612
01:43:19.586 --> 01:43:20.586
Mrs Voyter,

1613
01:43:20.666 --> 01:43:24.456
did you know he'd recorded
you before you were told?


1614
01:43:26.166 --> 01:43:29.746
No, but I knew that he often recorded
moments of our lives.


1615
01:43:29.956 --> 01:43:32.246
He didn't always let you know?

1616
01:43:32.416 --> 01:43:34.666
What were these recordings?

1617
01:43:35.746 --> 01:43:37.626
At first, he would mention it.

1618
01:43:37.786 --> 01:43:40.456
After a while,
he did it without us knowing.


1619
01:43:40.626 --> 01:43:43.336
He recorded conversations,

1620
01:43:43.496 --> 01:43:45.496
Daniel's piano lessons,

1621
01:43:45.666 --> 01:43:49.246
and sometimes just himself,
talking to himself.


1622
01:43:49.416 --> 01:43:53.996
I think he wanted to gather material
to help him start writing again.


1623
01:43:55.206 --> 01:43:58.536
Now, with hindsight,
it seems possible


1624
01:43:58.706 --> 01:44:01.996
that he could have provoked
this fight just to record it.


1625
01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:06.536
Wait, are you implying
you're the victim of a twisted man?


1626
01:44:06.706 --> 01:44:07.876
Seriously?

1627
01:44:08.416 --> 01:44:11.836
He recorded her in secret.
It's a valid question.


1628
01:44:11.996 --> 01:44:14.586
You forget the situation is perverse.

1629
01:44:15.416 --> 01:44:16.706
Now the victim is on trial!

1630
01:44:16.876 --> 01:44:18.786
No, but my client has a point.

1631
01:44:18.956 --> 01:44:22.246
Can you explain
what he means by cheating,


1632
01:44:22.416 --> 01:44:23.746
and how he found out?

1633
01:44:26.086 --> 01:44:29.086
He went through my phone
and discovered messages


1634
01:44:29.246 --> 01:44:31.956
from a woman I'd met
at the beginning of that year.


1635
01:44:32.126 --> 01:44:34.336
What do you mean by "met"?

1636
01:44:34.746 --> 01:44:37.086
It was sexual,
we slept together twice.


1637
01:44:37.246 --> 01:44:38.246
Twice?

1638
01:44:38.286 --> 01:44:39.286
Yes.

1639
01:44:39.456 --> 01:44:42.086
On the recording you said once.

1640
01:44:42.996 --> 01:44:45.336
It meant with just one person.

1641
01:44:46.036 --> 01:44:47.336
Hang on...

1642
01:44:47.836 --> 01:44:51.336
Samuel mentions
numerous affairs in the past.


1643
01:44:51.496 --> 01:44:54.166
It sounds like
you cheated constantly.


1644
01:44:54.376 --> 01:44:55.996
That's not true.

1645
01:44:56.536 --> 01:45:00.086
I had a few flings
the year of Daniel's accident.


1646
01:45:00.246 --> 01:45:02.496
It wasn't cheating,
because Samuel knew.


1647
01:45:02.666 --> 01:45:04.206
He found out each time?

1648
01:45:04.536 --> 01:45:06.086
No, I told him.

1649
01:45:06.746 --> 01:45:08.336
It was a tricky year.

1650
01:45:08.496 --> 01:45:10.746
You want us to believe
he agreed to it?


1651
01:45:11.376 --> 01:45:15.336
I'm not saying that,
I'm saying I was honest about it.


1652
01:45:16.086 --> 01:45:17.786
Interesting take on honesty.

1653
01:45:17.956 --> 01:45:21.246
But the year he died
you quit being honest, why?


1654
01:45:24.416 --> 01:45:25.916
Things were different.

1655
01:45:26.086 --> 01:45:29.536
I felt that it would hurt him
too much at that time.


1656
01:45:29.706 --> 01:45:32.626
Because you had feelings
for that woman?


1657
01:45:32.786 --> 01:45:35.626
No, I felt it would hurt him
because he was fragile.


1658
01:45:35.786 --> 01:45:37.286
And...

1659
01:45:37.456 --> 01:45:40.416
As I said,
with her it was just sexual.


1660
01:45:40.586 --> 01:45:43.376
The person I had feelings for
was Samuel.


1661
01:45:43.536 --> 01:45:45.416
Interesting take on feelings.

1662
01:45:45.586 --> 01:45:46.916
I'm trying to understand.

1663
01:45:47.086 --> 01:45:50.286
At first you agreed
on an open relationship,


1664
01:45:50.456 --> 01:45:52.166
then that changed?

1665
01:45:53.336 --> 01:45:56.246
I don't even know
what that means, I'm sorry.


1666
01:45:56.416 --> 01:45:59.876
Sorry. No, we never had
that kind of agreement.


1667
01:46:00.036 --> 01:46:04.376
After the accident,
we were both trying to feel better.


1668
01:46:04.536 --> 01:46:06.706
I needed that to keep it together,

1669
01:46:06.916 --> 01:46:08.086
and I was honest.

1670
01:46:08.246 --> 01:46:11.586
But then you quit being honest,
and he held you accountable.


1671
01:46:11.746 --> 01:46:14.166
He doesn't sound "fragile".

1672
01:46:14.336 --> 01:46:16.706
- Do you admit he was jealous?
- Yes.


1673
01:46:16.876 --> 01:46:18.786
OK. Had he become obsessed?

1674
01:46:18.996 --> 01:46:20.666
No. I don't know...

1675
01:46:21.086 --> 01:46:23.206
He was hurt, that's true.

1676
01:46:24.626 --> 01:46:26.876
Sometimes when we fought
he brought it up.


1677
01:46:27.036 --> 01:46:29.536
But he didn't think about it
all the time.


1678
01:46:30.036 --> 01:46:34.086
According to your logic,
all Samuel's problems were my fault.


1679
01:46:34.246 --> 01:46:37.086
That's not true.
His pain came from a deeper place.


1680
01:46:37.286 --> 01:46:41.496
According to "his" logic
you're to blame, as we heard.


1681
01:46:41.666 --> 01:46:45.036
What does he mean when he says
his work was plundered?


1682
01:46:45.246 --> 01:46:48.336
No, there wasn't any plundering.

1683
01:46:48.496 --> 01:46:52.706
In the book that he abandoned,
there was an interesting passage...


1684
01:46:52.876 --> 01:46:54.666
A passage?
How many pages?


1685
01:46:54.996 --> 01:46:56.036
About 20.

1686
01:46:56.246 --> 01:46:57.376
27.

1687
01:46:58.166 --> 01:47:01.536
It was just a rough outline.
I thought the idea was brilliant.


1688
01:47:01.706 --> 01:47:02.836
Can you summarize it?

1689
01:47:02.996 --> 01:47:05.586
Must we enter into a literary debate?

1690
01:47:05.746 --> 01:47:07.746
This isn't literary, it's concrete.

1691
01:47:07.956 --> 01:47:09.706
It's the heart of their conflict.

1692
01:47:10.036 --> 01:47:13.286
I don't know how else
to present it to the jurors.


1693
01:47:13.456 --> 01:47:14.456
Nor do I.

1694
01:47:14.586 --> 01:47:15.626
Proceed.

1695
01:47:15.786 --> 01:47:16.956
Well...

1696
01:47:17.126 --> 01:47:20.126
It was about a guy imagining
how his life would've been


1697
01:47:20.286 --> 01:47:22.666
without the accident
that killed his brother.


1698
01:47:22.996 --> 01:47:25.836
He wakes up and finds himself
in two different realities.


1699
01:47:25.996 --> 01:47:27.996
In one, the accident
is the center of his life.


1700
01:47:28.166 --> 01:47:30.206
In the other, it never happened.

1701
01:47:30.376 --> 01:47:32.836
I told Samuel I loved it.

1702
01:47:32.996 --> 01:47:36.126
He had me read
everything he wrote back then.


1703
01:47:36.456 --> 01:47:39.706
Soon after,
he abandoned the whole book.


1704
01:47:39.876 --> 01:47:42.626
I asked him if I could use the idea
and he said yes.


1705
01:47:42.836 --> 01:47:43.876
No.

1706
01:47:44.536 --> 01:47:47.206
He couldn't have,
he calls it plundering.


1707
01:47:47.376 --> 01:47:49.206
It's an argument.

1708
01:47:49.376 --> 01:47:52.626
People exaggerate and alter facts
when they argue.


1709
01:47:52.786 --> 01:47:55.586
It's no exaggeration to say his
book became yours: "ECLIPSE".


1710
01:47:59.916 --> 01:48:03.626
All I took was this idea.

1711
01:48:03.786 --> 01:48:06.376
My characters are a woman
and her daughter,


1712
01:48:06.536 --> 01:48:07.706
and I developed the story

1713
01:48:07.916 --> 01:48:09.746
over 300 pages.

1714
01:48:11.876 --> 01:48:16.126
I can't believe I must tell you what's the
difference between an outline and a novel?


1715
01:48:16.286 --> 01:48:17.626
He agreed to it.

1716
01:48:17.786 --> 01:48:21.996
And when he read it, he said
I did something very different.


1717
01:48:22.166 --> 01:48:25.916
Sometimes yes, when we argued
it came out, because...


1718
01:48:26.086 --> 01:48:28.836
he was upset
because he couldn't write.


1719
01:48:29.036 --> 01:48:32.786
The only thing we know for sure
is that "it came out".


1720
01:48:32.956 --> 01:48:34.666
Did the two of you...

1721
01:48:35.246 --> 01:48:38.206
argue again
before the time of his death?


1722
01:48:38.376 --> 01:48:40.456
It must've been very tense.

1723
01:48:43.166 --> 01:48:44.246
We were...

1724
01:48:45.496 --> 01:48:47.246
we were both really shaken.

1725
01:48:47.416 --> 01:48:50.836
We were both keeping to ourselves
and Samuel was...


1726
01:48:52.086 --> 01:48:53.626
I don't know, something was gone.

1727
01:48:53.786 --> 01:48:56.586
He was depleted,
his energy was just gone.


1728
01:48:56.746 --> 01:49:00.166
In the audio, I hear Samuel Maleski
arguing strenuously.


1729
01:49:00.336 --> 01:49:03.626
I hear a man determined
to regain control of his life.


1730
01:49:03.786 --> 01:49:06.746
In no way
a man who has decided to give up.


1731
01:49:06.916 --> 01:49:11.456
Samuel's psychiatrist said he was
combative in their last sessions.


1732
01:49:11.626 --> 01:49:16.246
Do you kill yourself after fighting
for time and self-esteem?


1733
01:49:16.416 --> 01:49:20.956
Do you kill yourself after pleading
so fiercely and energetically


1734
01:49:21.126 --> 01:49:24.626
for balance and justice
in your relationship? No.


1735
01:49:25.626 --> 01:49:28.416
That's the main flaw
in the suicide theory.


1736
01:49:28.586 --> 01:49:31.786
You say he seemed "depleted".

1737
01:49:31.956 --> 01:49:33.536
His energy was gone.

1738
01:49:33.876 --> 01:49:37.876
May I read from one of Mrs Voyter's
recent books, "The Black House"?


1739
01:49:38.036 --> 01:49:39.876
We judge facts, not books.

1740
01:49:40.036 --> 01:49:42.746
Judge, this is a slippery slope.

1741
01:49:42.916 --> 01:49:46.336
In 2017, Sandra Voyter herself
declared, and I quote,


1742
01:49:46.496 --> 01:49:49.536
"My books are linked to my life
and those in it."


1743
01:49:49.746 --> 01:49:52.666
Objection! She's always said
her work is fiction.


1744
01:49:53.286 --> 01:49:55.746
First book is her mother's death!

1745
01:49:55.916 --> 01:49:57.666
Second, a rift with her father.

1746
01:49:57.836 --> 01:50:00.036
Third, her son's accident, etc.

1747
01:50:00.206 --> 01:50:02.286
Her books are part of this trial.

1748
01:50:02.456 --> 01:50:05.336
Her life is in them,
her relationship in particular.


1749
01:50:05.496 --> 01:50:07.336
Go ahead, but keep it brief.

1750
01:50:07.996 --> 01:50:11.126
This is a wife
talking about her husband.


1751
01:50:13.956 --> 01:50:16.916
"He'd stopped complaining.
He'd given up."


1752
01:50:17.416 --> 01:50:20.706
"She studied him,
repulsed by his resignation."


1753
01:50:21.416 --> 01:50:24.626
"An idea sprouted in her mind,
a seed of deliverance."


1754
01:50:24.956 --> 01:50:26.376
"The possibility of his death."

1755
01:50:26.536 --> 01:50:27.626
Give us the context.

1756
01:50:27.786 --> 01:50:29.626
Later: "How does one kill?"

1757
01:50:29.786 --> 01:50:32.586
"What about the body? Its weight?

1758
01:50:32.746 --> 01:50:35.036
"She could think of nothing else.

1759
01:50:35.456 --> 01:50:39.206
"She saw him dead,
his body a lump no longer desired.


1760
01:50:39.376 --> 01:50:41.206
"The body she'd loved

1761
01:50:41.376 --> 01:50:43.586
was now in the way
and had to go."


1762
01:50:43.746 --> 01:50:45.456
I'll provide the context.

1763
01:50:45.666 --> 01:50:49.126
This is a minor character,
going insane,


1764
01:50:49.286 --> 01:50:51.286
who doesn't act on her thoughts.

1765
01:50:51.456 --> 01:50:53.876
A novel is not life!
An author is not her characters.


1766
01:50:54.036 --> 01:50:57.336
But an author can express herself
through her characters.


1767
01:50:57.496 --> 01:50:58.956
You flagged this passage.

1768
01:50:59.126 --> 01:51:00.916
How can we not see a link?

1769
01:51:01.126 --> 01:51:03.126
Is Stephen King a serial killer?

1770
01:51:03.286 --> 01:51:06.286
Did his wife turn up dead
in suspicious circumstances?


1771
01:51:06.456 --> 01:51:07.536
Focus on the facts!

1772
01:51:07.746 --> 01:51:11.126
Mr. Renzi,
I strongly advise you to calm down.


1773
01:51:11.286 --> 01:51:14.536
Prosecutor, I advise you
to follow Mr. Renzi's advice.


1774
01:51:15.206 --> 01:51:17.376
Focus on the facts.

1775
01:51:20.626 --> 01:51:22.206
Aside from the slap

1776
01:51:22.416 --> 01:51:25.166
you admitted to,
did you ever hit your husband?


1777
01:51:25.626 --> 01:51:26.706
Never?

1778
01:51:27.336 --> 01:51:28.586
That was the only time?

1779
01:51:28.786 --> 01:51:32.166
You were always a good,
admirable soul,


1780
01:51:32.626 --> 01:51:34.416
altruistic, reasonable,

1781
01:51:34.586 --> 01:51:36.706
trying to save him from himself,

1782
01:51:36.876 --> 01:51:39.416
except on this recording?
Rotten luck!


1783
01:51:40.996 --> 01:51:42.996
Any more questions
for the witness?


1784
01:51:43.166 --> 01:51:45.286
I have one more, if I may.

1785
01:51:46.586 --> 01:51:49.086
I'd like to know if Maleski

1786
01:51:49.286 --> 01:51:51.376
sent the transcripts to anyone?

1787
01:51:51.536 --> 01:51:54.086
He sent them to a publisher friend,
Paul Nachez,


1788
01:51:54.246 --> 01:51:56.206
slated to publish his first novel.

1789
01:51:56.376 --> 01:51:58.036
Email from August 9, 2017:

1790
01:51:58.206 --> 01:52:01.746
"I'm writing again, I need your eye.
Still rough, eager to talk."


1791
01:52:01.916 --> 01:52:03.086
Nachez's response:

1792
01:52:03.286 --> 01:52:05.626
"Sure, send it and I'll read it."

1793
01:52:05.786 --> 01:52:08.746
Up to his death,
Maleski sent 4 texts a week.


1794
01:52:08.916 --> 01:52:10.746
What was their communication like?

1795
01:52:10.916 --> 01:52:13.086
The publisher never replied.

1796
01:52:13.416 --> 01:52:16.126
Apparently he was busy
and the project mystified him.


1797
01:52:16.836 --> 01:52:18.416
His friend's silence

1798
01:52:18.626 --> 01:52:22.836
must've hurt Mr. Maleski's
already low self-esteem.


1799
01:52:22.996 --> 01:52:24.536
He feels rejected.

1800
01:52:25.036 --> 01:52:27.786
When we read all the writing he sent,

1801
01:52:27.956 --> 01:52:30.246
it's difficult
to identify a storyline.


1802
01:52:30.416 --> 01:52:31.996
At best, it's a project.

1803
01:52:32.166 --> 01:52:33.666
Maleski is a "project man".

1804
01:52:33.836 --> 01:52:36.336
His first abandoned novel,
the chalet...


1805
01:52:37.036 --> 01:52:40.996
So, since we're being asked
to mix justice and literature,


1806
01:52:41.166 --> 01:52:43.036
to imagine what we don't know,

1807
01:52:43.206 --> 01:52:46.996
let's imagine
Samuel Maleski's final year.


1808
01:52:47.166 --> 01:52:48.916
And I'm dabbling in fantasy?

1809
01:52:49.126 --> 01:52:53.036
Give me half the time
you took to read a book!


1810
01:52:53.206 --> 01:52:54.586
Get to the point.

1811
01:52:55.166 --> 01:52:57.376
What was
Samuel Maleski's final year like?


1812
01:52:58.786 --> 01:53:02.956
After accumulating debt
from medical procedures in London,


1813
01:53:03.126 --> 01:53:06.166
he insists on returning
to his hometown.


1814
01:53:06.336 --> 01:53:09.916
He finds a chalet to fix up and rent.
They'll pay off their debts.


1815
01:53:10.086 --> 01:53:13.036
He'll quit teaching
and start writing full-time.


1816
01:53:13.456 --> 01:53:17.166
Renovation proves tricky.
They have to take out a loan.


1817
01:53:17.956 --> 01:53:19.956
A vicious circle begins.

1818
01:53:20.126 --> 01:53:24.126
Samuel needs his teaching wages.
Renovations drag on.


1819
01:53:24.286 --> 01:53:26.456
A year and a half later,

1820
01:53:26.626 --> 01:53:27.996
he feels trapped.

1821
01:53:28.336 --> 01:53:29.876
He's a wounded man.

1822
01:53:30.086 --> 01:53:31.876
His son's accident,
his abandoned novel,


1823
01:53:32.036 --> 01:53:34.416
his wife publishing book after book.

1824
01:53:35.166 --> 01:53:36.586
He must write!

1825
01:53:38.916 --> 01:53:42.246
He quits the antidepressants
and starts recording his life,


1826
01:53:42.416 --> 01:53:44.996
embarking on a kind of auto-fiction,

1827
01:53:45.166 --> 01:53:48.206
perhaps inspired by Sandra's method.

1828
01:53:48.376 --> 01:53:51.286
And why not?
She borrows from their lives.


1829
01:53:51.456 --> 01:53:53.376
She did borrow his idea.

1830
01:53:53.586 --> 01:53:54.876
Save it for your plea.

1831
01:53:55.036 --> 01:53:58.956
He's running.
But refuses to see that transcribing


1832
01:53:59.166 --> 01:54:00.246
is not writing.

1833
01:54:00.416 --> 01:54:03.086
His publisher friend's silence
humiliates him.


1834
01:54:04.286 --> 01:54:07.246
What do we hear
in the March 4th fight?


1835
01:54:07.586 --> 01:54:10.536
The energy, the willfulness...
What is it?


1836
01:54:10.916 --> 01:54:12.496
The energy of despair.

1837
01:54:12.666 --> 01:54:15.496
The final push before giving up.

1838
01:54:18.786 --> 01:54:23.036
In his final days, this man
isn't facing a war in his marriage.


1839
01:54:24.246 --> 01:54:26.336
He's facing his own failures.

1840
01:54:28.036 --> 01:54:30.166
Sandra Voyter is only guilty

1841
01:54:30.336 --> 01:54:32.996
of succeeding
where her husband failed.


1842
01:54:37.036 --> 01:54:41.456
Despite appearances, those were not
Mr. Renzi's closing arguments.


1843
01:54:43.206 --> 01:54:44.956
That wasn't Samuel.

1844
01:54:45.126 --> 01:54:48.246
It's Friday evening,
we have a weekend ahead of us.


1845
01:54:48.916 --> 01:54:51.456
Before I adjourn,
I have an announcement.


1846
01:54:51.626 --> 01:54:54.956
I've decided to call Daniel
back to the bar on Monday.


1847
01:54:55.376 --> 01:54:57.626
He has new information of interest.

1848
01:54:57.836 --> 01:55:01.376
Since the witness
is the defendant's son


1849
01:55:01.836 --> 01:55:03.746
and lives with his mother,

1850
01:55:03.916 --> 01:55:07.416
I'm asking everyone
to refrain from contacting him.


1851
01:55:07.876 --> 01:55:11.286
Obviously, if contact is inevitable,

1852
01:55:11.456 --> 01:55:14.376
refrain from discussing the trial.

1853
01:55:14.536 --> 01:55:15.786
Mrs Berger,

1854
01:55:15.956 --> 01:55:19.036
you'll stay with Daniel all weekend.

1855
01:55:20.036 --> 01:55:23.416
See to it these rules are respected.

1856
01:55:23.626 --> 01:55:25.496
I insist that no one,

1857
01:55:25.666 --> 01:55:29.956
absolutely no one,
can ask him about his testimony.


1858
01:55:30.836 --> 01:55:33.036
Have a good weekend,
get some rest.


1859
01:55:33.206 --> 01:55:34.916
Court is adjourned.

1860
01:56:22.956 --> 01:56:25.166
- Come get warm.
- Ready in 10!


1861
01:56:31.456 --> 01:56:32.586
You OK?

1862
01:56:39.916 --> 01:56:41.996
I think I want to be alone.

1863
01:56:43.456 --> 01:56:44.666
OK.

1864
01:56:46.336 --> 01:56:48.626
- You can eat in your room.
- No.


1865
01:56:48.786 --> 01:56:50.666
I want to be alone this weekend.

1866
01:56:51.166 --> 01:56:52.286
Before I testify.

1867
01:56:52.456 --> 01:56:53.456
Alone?

1868
01:56:53.536 --> 01:56:55.166
Just you and me?

1869
01:56:56.166 --> 01:56:57.166
Is that it?

1870
01:56:58.786 --> 01:57:00.416
Are you sure?

1871
01:57:01.626 --> 01:57:04.876
We can find other solutions.
It's a big house.


1872
01:57:05.496 --> 01:57:07.036
I want her to leave.

1873
01:57:17.956 --> 01:57:19.536
I just spoke to Daniel.

1874
01:57:20.586 --> 01:57:23.246
He wants to be alone this weekend.

1875
01:57:23.416 --> 01:57:25.126
Until the end of the trial.

1876
01:57:39.586 --> 01:57:41.836
Is that what you want?

1877
01:57:46.786 --> 01:57:49.286
OK. Is it because
of what you heard today?


1878
01:57:49.456 --> 01:57:52.706
I couldn't talk to you
about all that before.


1879
01:57:52.876 --> 01:57:55.166
We weren't allowed to..

1880
01:57:56.416 --> 01:57:57.536
No trial talk.

1881
01:57:57.706 --> 01:58:00.416
I know, I'm just talking to my son.

1882
01:58:00.876 --> 01:58:01.956
OK.

1883
01:58:03.246 --> 01:58:05.786
I totally understand
that you need calm.


1884
01:58:05.956 --> 01:58:08.376
I can mind my own business,
keep to myself.


1885
01:58:08.536 --> 01:58:11.786
I won't talk to you
if you don't want. Can we try that?


1886
01:58:11.996 --> 01:58:13.206
No speaking English.

1887
01:58:14.246 --> 01:58:16.336
You can talk to me.

1888
01:58:17.376 --> 01:58:21.536
Couldn't you and I discuss this,
and then you decide?


1889
01:58:23.706 --> 01:58:25.746
I think he's made his decision.

1890
01:58:36.706 --> 01:58:38.916
Yeah, I'll just get my stuff.

1891
01:59:05.286 --> 01:59:06.876
Somebody said,

1892
01:59:07.706 --> 01:59:10.086
of course money
doesn't make you happy,


1893
01:59:10.416 --> 01:59:14.456
but it's still better to cry in a car
than in a subway.


1894
01:59:17.876 --> 01:59:18.916
Who said that?

1895
01:59:19.086 --> 01:59:20.416
I don't know.

1896
02:00:21.626 --> 02:00:22.916
Sorry.

1897
02:00:48.456 --> 02:00:49.536
Go on.

1898
02:00:56.376 --> 02:00:57.666
Eat up.

1899
02:01:26.876 --> 02:01:27.996
Snoop...

1900
02:01:40.246 --> 02:01:41.416
Marge!

1901
02:01:43.836 --> 02:01:46.126
Marge, come quick, please!

1902
02:01:52.706 --> 02:01:53.706
What is it?

1903
02:01:56.586 --> 02:01:59.086
I gave him aspirin,
I messed up bad.


1904
02:02:00.166 --> 02:02:02.206
- You gave him aspirin?
- Yes!


1905
02:02:02.376 --> 02:02:03.496
How much?

1906
02:02:04.086 --> 02:02:06.456
8 or 10, I can't remember.

1907
02:02:06.626 --> 02:02:07.626
A lot.

1908
02:02:08.456 --> 02:02:09.876
Make him vomit.

1909
02:02:10.036 --> 02:02:11.206
Why'd you do that?

1910
02:02:11.996 --> 02:02:13.776
Make him vomit! Please!

1911
02:02:13.886 --> 02:02:14.926
OK, hang on.

1912
02:02:17.166 --> 02:02:18.286
"Make a dog vomit."

1913
02:02:19.036 --> 02:02:20.246
Hang on.

1914
02:02:20.416 --> 02:02:23.086
We need saltwater.
Be right back.


1915
02:02:33.246 --> 02:02:34.336
He's not moving.

1916
02:02:34.536 --> 02:02:36.126
Daniel, help me.

1917
02:02:37.376 --> 02:02:38.746
Open his mouth.

1918
02:02:39.626 --> 02:02:40.666
Easy.

1919
02:02:50.206 --> 02:02:51.746
That's right.

1920
02:02:57.246 --> 02:02:58.456
That's good.

1921
02:03:01.126 --> 02:03:02.876
He's coming around.

1922
02:03:05.416 --> 02:03:07.956
- What's happening?
- He's going to vomit.


1923
02:03:13.836 --> 02:03:14.836
That's it.

1924
02:03:14.956 --> 02:03:16.286
He'll be OK.

1925
02:03:20.086 --> 02:03:21.456
Good dog.

1926
02:03:29.586 --> 02:03:32.376
He's OK, he's breathing.
Looking at us.


1927
02:03:37.786 --> 02:03:39.036
Can you explain?

1928
02:03:42.836 --> 02:03:44.246
You know, I...

1929
02:03:44.916 --> 02:03:46.956
I'd never heard about...

1930
02:03:48.416 --> 02:03:50.586
my dad's suicide attempt.

1931
02:03:51.726 --> 02:03:54.056
I'd never heard about...

1932
02:03:54.786 --> 02:03:57.536
the shrink, the medicine...

1933
02:03:58.456 --> 02:03:59.766
the vomit and aspirin.

1934
02:04:00.836 --> 02:04:03.536
When my mom talked about it,
I remembered something


1935
02:04:03.706 --> 02:04:05.286
from around that time.

1936
02:04:06.376 --> 02:04:07.496
One morning,

1937
02:04:07.726 --> 02:04:09.976
Snoop was lying on my bedroom floor.

1938
02:04:10.126 --> 02:04:12.286
Not moving.
He smelled like vomit.


1939
02:04:14.286 --> 02:04:16.336
I figured he'd vomited.

1940
02:04:17.786 --> 02:04:19.626
I cleaned his muzzle.

1941
02:04:20.666 --> 02:04:22.836
I figured he'd...

1942
02:04:23.336 --> 02:04:27.086
I don't know, caught a virus
or something, because...


1943
02:04:27.876 --> 02:04:30.496
he acted strange for days.

1944
02:04:30.666 --> 02:04:32.586
He just slept or drank.

1945
02:04:33.746 --> 02:04:37.996
See? Now I'm thinking
maybe he ate my dad's vomit,


1946
02:04:38.166 --> 02:04:39.666
and "that" made him sick,

1947
02:04:39.836 --> 02:04:41.876
and Mom told the truth!

1948
02:04:43.416 --> 02:04:46.246
So my experiment with the aspirin

1949
02:04:46.416 --> 02:04:48.376
was to see how he'd react.

1950
02:04:48.536 --> 02:04:49.626
And you saw.

1951
02:04:49.786 --> 02:04:53.416
He slept for 14 hours.
Now he's drinking all the time.


1952
02:04:53.586 --> 02:04:55.586
He smells exactly the same!

1953
02:04:56.206 --> 02:04:57.206
Everything!

1954
02:04:57.266 --> 02:04:59.306
Everything's exactly the same!

1955
02:05:00.876 --> 02:05:02.376
But since..

1956
02:05:03.016 --> 02:05:06.426
Since yesterday,
I'm not sure if I believe her or not.


1957
02:05:06.586 --> 02:05:08.456
I knew they fought, but...

1958
02:05:12.956 --> 02:05:14.496
It wasn't...

1959
02:05:15.626 --> 02:05:18.246
I didn't think it was that violent.

1960
02:05:20.246 --> 02:05:22.626
Your memories are all you're sure of,

1961
02:05:22.786 --> 02:05:24.786
and it's important to tell the jury.

1962
02:05:24.956 --> 02:05:26.746
But you're just a witness.

1963
02:05:26.916 --> 02:05:29.246
Do you think she could've killed him?

1964
02:05:32.746 --> 02:05:34.126
It's not for me to judge.

1965
02:05:34.286 --> 02:05:37.206
I know,
but you could at least tell me!


1966
02:05:37.436 --> 02:05:40.686
I can't answer that.
My role is to protect you...


1967
02:05:40.896 --> 02:05:42.686
Fucking help me!

1968
02:06:19.956 --> 02:06:21.166
Actually,

1969
02:06:21.336 --> 02:06:23.496
when we lack an element

1970
02:06:23.726 --> 02:06:26.176
to judge something,
and the lack is unbearable,


1971
02:06:27.336 --> 02:06:29.416
all we can do is decide.

1972
02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:32.086
You see?

1973
02:06:32.746 --> 02:06:35.586
To overcome doubt,
sometimes we have to...


1974
02:06:35.746 --> 02:06:38.416
decide to sway
one way rather than the other.


1975
02:06:40.376 --> 02:06:44.286
Since you need to believe one thing
but have two choices,


1976
02:06:44.456 --> 02:06:45.956
you must choose.

1977
02:06:47.036 --> 02:06:49.246
So you have to invent your belief?

1978
02:06:49.586 --> 02:06:51.626
Yes, well... in a sense.

1979
02:06:51.996 --> 02:06:54.666
So that means, 
I'm not sure...

1980
02:06:55.586 --> 02:06:59.206
and you're saying
I have to pretend I'm sure?


1981
02:06:59.996 --> 02:07:01.996
No, I'm saying decide.

1982
02:07:03.666 --> 02:07:05.246
That's different.

1983
02:07:36.876 --> 02:07:40.496
What strikes me is
we don't know who's more lyrical.


1984
02:07:40.706 --> 02:07:43.536
- The author or the character?
- Both, no doubt!


1985
02:07:43.706 --> 02:07:45.496
Voyter plays with confusion.

1986
02:07:45.666 --> 02:07:47.496
Her second book goes further,

1987
02:07:47.706 --> 02:07:50.876
telling how her father
couldn't stand the first.


1988
02:07:51.036 --> 02:07:52.166
Undoubtedly true.

1989
02:07:52.336 --> 02:07:56.086
The rift degenerates,
forcing her to leave her country.


1990
02:07:56.286 --> 02:08:00.376
Fearing her father's rage,
she falls prey to horrifying visions.


1991
02:08:00.536 --> 02:08:04.786
I found this troubling quote
in an interview. She says,


1992
02:08:05.126 --> 02:08:07.086
"My job is to cover the tracks,"

1993
02:08:07.246 --> 02:08:09.996
"so fiction can destroy reality."

1994
02:08:11.586 --> 02:08:13.416
Yes, and what excites people

1995
02:08:13.586 --> 02:08:15.666
about the Samuel Maleski case,

1996
02:08:15.836 --> 02:08:18.706
is that it seems to come
from one of her books.


1997
02:08:18.876 --> 02:08:21.336
It feels like
she's already written it.


1998
02:08:21.496 --> 02:08:25.166
Even the doubts around his death,
the way he died,


1999
02:08:25.336 --> 02:08:28.666
Voyter's murky personality,
the amoral, deceptive traits


2000
02:08:28.836 --> 02:08:30.206
she seems to overplay...

2001
02:08:30.376 --> 02:08:32.786
It all reads like her books.

2002
02:08:32.996 --> 02:08:35.416
I don't think it matters how he died.

2003
02:08:35.586 --> 02:08:39.166
The fact is, the idea of a writer
killing her husband


2004
02:08:39.336 --> 02:08:42.996
is far more compelling
than a teacher killing himself.


2005
02:10:53.706 --> 02:10:56.416
If I imagine my mother doing it,
I don't understand.


2006
02:10:58.786 --> 02:11:00.706
But if I imagine my father...

2007
02:11:02.956 --> 02:11:05.166
I think I can understand.

2008
02:11:11.376 --> 02:11:13.536
Prosecutor, any questions?

2009
02:11:16.496 --> 02:11:19.206
The experiment on his dog
proves nothing.


2010
02:11:19.376 --> 02:11:21.166
It's not documented.

2011
02:11:21.336 --> 02:11:24.246
More problematic
are these providential memories,


2012
02:11:24.416 --> 02:11:27.786
clearly jarred
by what he heard during the trial.


2013
02:11:28.416 --> 02:11:31.536
No event can be placed
convincingly on our timeline.


2014
02:11:31.706 --> 02:11:34.286
The time frame of 6 months
before Maleski's death


2015
02:11:34.456 --> 02:11:36.266
comes only from testimony

2016
02:11:36.416 --> 02:11:38.586
given by the defendant herself.

2017
02:11:42.336 --> 02:11:43.746
I'd like to know...

2018
02:11:50.416 --> 02:11:51.786
Did you ever wonder

2019
02:11:51.996 --> 02:11:54.956
if the overdose
your father supposedly took


2020
02:11:55.126 --> 02:11:58.536
might've resulted
not from a suicide attempt,


2021
02:11:58.706 --> 02:12:01.536
but from an attempt by your mother
to poison him?


2022
02:12:01.706 --> 02:12:04.416
I'm not accusing,
just making a point.


2023
02:12:04.586 --> 02:12:06.996
So, taking these speculations,

2024
02:12:07.166 --> 02:12:09.746
why choose one over the other?

2025
02:12:09.916 --> 02:12:13.996
Your memories speak
to the consequences, not the causes.


2026
02:12:15.206 --> 02:12:17.586
Yes, I thought about that, but...

2027
02:12:18.496 --> 02:12:20.916
I don't see
why she would've done it.


2028
02:12:21.456 --> 02:12:23.876
It feels like when we lack proof

2029
02:12:24.036 --> 02:12:26.706
to make us sure
how something happened,


2030
02:12:27.246 --> 02:12:30.166
we have to look further,
as the trial is doing.


2031
02:12:30.686 --> 02:12:34.226
When we've looked everywhere
and still don't understand


2032
02:12:34.436 --> 02:12:36.886
how the thing happened,

2033
02:12:37.036 --> 02:12:39.916
I think we have to ask
why it happened.


2034
02:12:44.916 --> 02:12:46.206
Thank you, Daniel.

2035
02:12:47.036 --> 02:12:48.206
Are you finished?

2036
02:12:56.586 --> 02:12:57.786
No.

2037
02:12:59.456 --> 02:13:01.206
I want to say something else.

2038
02:13:08.286 --> 02:13:12.706
Since my dog was sick for days,
Dad and I went to the vet.


2039
02:13:14.166 --> 02:13:16.286
Dad was really quiet in the car.

2040
02:13:16.456 --> 02:13:19.746
He didn't even play music.
He usually always does.


2041
02:13:22.336 --> 02:13:25.286
After a while,
he started talking about Snoop.


2042
02:13:26.876 --> 02:13:27.666
He said,

2043
02:13:27.846 --> 02:13:29.846
"You know, he could get sick."

2044
02:13:30.496 --> 02:13:33.746
"Even die. You know that.
You need to be ready."


2045
02:13:35.336 --> 02:13:36.956
I didn't want to hear that.

2046
02:13:37.706 --> 02:13:40.916
Snoop was doing better.
He was still young.


2047
02:13:41.146 --> 02:13:42.306
He'd never been sick.

2048
02:13:42.456 --> 02:13:44.706
I told him he wasn't going to die.

2049
02:13:46.806 --> 02:13:48.176
But he kept going.

2050
02:13:48.706 --> 02:13:52.956
He said, "You need to be aware of it.
It'll happen someday."


2051
02:13:53.916 --> 02:13:56.916
"And it's no wonder Snoop gets tired."

2052
02:13:57.086 --> 02:13:59.086
"He's not so young in dog years."

2053
02:14:02.286 --> 02:14:03.996
"Can you imagine his life?"

2054
02:14:06.166 --> 02:14:07.876
"He's not just any dog."

2055
02:14:08.836 --> 02:14:10.416
"He's a great dog."

2056
02:14:11.956 --> 02:14:13.836
"An outstanding dog."

2057
02:14:14.836 --> 02:14:17.786
"Think about it.
He anticipates your needs,"


2058
02:14:18.206 --> 02:14:20.416
"foresees your movements,"

2059
02:14:20.996 --> 02:14:22.746
"keeps you safe from danger."

2060
02:14:24.536 --> 02:14:26.786
"He spends his life
imagining your needs"


2061
02:14:26.956 --> 02:14:29.246
"thinking about what you can't see."

2062
02:14:32.836 --> 02:14:34.246
"Maybe he's tired."

2063
02:14:34.666 --> 02:14:36.336
"Always caring for others."

2064
02:14:37.126 --> 02:14:39.086
"Maybe one day, he'll be done."

2065
02:14:39.956 --> 02:14:41.246
"That could happen."

2066
02:14:46.336 --> 02:14:48.206
And I remember at the end,

2067
02:14:50.036 --> 02:14:51.996
he said, "One day",

2068
02:14:52.166 --> 02:14:55.126
"when it's time
for him to go, he'll go."


2069
02:14:56.246 --> 02:14:59.746
"You won't be able to help it.
Prepare yourself, it'll be hard."


2070
02:14:59.916 --> 02:15:02.336
"But it won't be
the end of your life."


2071
02:15:08.916 --> 02:15:10.456
He meant himself.

2072
02:15:11.286 --> 02:15:12.536
Now...

2073
02:15:13.956 --> 02:15:16.086
Now I know he meant himself.

2074
02:15:22.786 --> 02:15:25.956
I implore the jurors to bear in mind

2075
02:15:26.166 --> 02:15:28.416
this story is extremely subjective.

2076
02:15:28.836 --> 02:15:32.746
In no way does it qualify
as any form of proof.


2077
02:15:53.126 --> 02:15:56.996
Yes Serge, we are still
outside the courthouse in Grenoble.


2078
02:15:57.166 --> 02:16:00.086
The trial was scheduled
to end on Friday,


2079
02:16:00.246 --> 02:16:02.706
but Sandra Voyter's son Daniel

2080
02:16:02.876 --> 02:16:05.206
insisted on testifying again
this morning.


2081
02:16:05.376 --> 02:16:06.956
The jury is still...

2082
02:16:22.766 --> 02:16:23.786
Daniel.

2083
02:16:24.166 --> 02:16:27.746
Mrs Voyter, how do you feel...

2084
02:16:27.956 --> 02:16:30.086
after being acquitted?

2085
02:16:31.186 --> 02:16:34.766
There were too many words
in this trial.


2086
02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:36.496
I've nothing more to say.

2087
02:16:36.996 --> 02:16:40.246
I want to call
my son and go home.

2088
02:16:41.336 --> 02:16:45.376
Obviously I thank my lawyers,
who always believed in me.


2089
02:16:45.536 --> 02:16:48.166
Mr. Renzi, are you relieved?

2090
02:16:48.336 --> 02:16:50.496
I commend the jury,

2091
02:16:50.836 --> 02:16:53.416
who saw Sandra Voyter as she is...

2092
02:17:55.166 --> 02:17:57.036
Marge, it's Sandra.

2093
02:17:59.126 --> 02:18:01.666
Yes, it's incredible, we're relieved.

2094
02:18:05.706 --> 02:18:07.916
Does Daniel want to talk to me?

2095
02:18:10.376 --> 02:18:12.626
Of course, he must be tired,

2096
02:18:12.856 --> 02:18:14.056
I understand.

2097
02:18:15.876 --> 02:18:18.786
Does he mind if I come home tonight?

2098
02:18:19.016 --> 02:18:20.886
Would he prefer tomorrow, or...

2099
02:18:25.786 --> 02:18:27.496
OK, OK.

2100
02:18:28.206 --> 02:18:31.786
We'll get some dinner,
then I'll be home. See you then.


2101
02:18:35.336 --> 02:18:36.786
I need a drink.

2102
02:18:41.356 --> 02:18:42.606
Another!

2103
02:18:51.416 --> 02:18:52.786
Do you always...

2104
02:18:52.956 --> 02:18:56.086
When you win,
do you always do this?


2105
02:18:56.246 --> 02:18:57.626
We never win.

2106
02:18:59.336 --> 02:19:02.126
That's the fucking first time
in our life we win!


2107
02:19:02.286 --> 02:19:03.626
- No!
- Yes, of course!


2108
02:19:03.786 --> 02:19:05.786
You told me you're a good lawyer.

2109
02:19:09.286 --> 02:19:10.536
No, it's not true!

2110
02:19:10.656 --> 02:19:11.656
It's not spicy.

2111
02:19:11.746 --> 02:19:13.536
You have to try this, really.

2112
02:19:13.746 --> 02:19:15.036
We ate too much.

2113
02:19:15.206 --> 02:19:16.286
I'm gonna throw up.

2114
02:19:16.496 --> 02:19:18.126
A quick smoke first.

2115
02:19:18.456 --> 02:19:19.536
Be right back.

2116
02:19:24.286 --> 02:19:25.586
You first.

2117
02:19:39.456 --> 02:19:41.246
It's not so easy, huh?

2118
02:19:42.916 --> 02:19:44.746
With all the bones, and...

2119
02:19:49.376 --> 02:19:50.586
After this, we go?

2120
02:19:50.916 --> 02:19:52.456
Ready to go home?

2121
02:19:53.286 --> 02:19:55.876
I can drive, I can drive you.

2122
02:19:57.036 --> 02:19:58.086
One more.

2123
02:19:58.876 --> 02:20:00.286
For the road.

2124
02:20:01.626 --> 02:20:03.496
Of course, for the driver.

2125
02:20:04.586 --> 02:20:05.666
Same?

2126
02:20:13.836 --> 02:20:15.536
Can I just get

2127
02:20:15.746 --> 02:20:17.956
two more of these? Thanks.

2128
02:20:34.126 --> 02:20:35.166
To you.

2129
02:20:50.456 --> 02:20:51.626
Are you alright?

2130
02:20:55.836 --> 02:20:57.036
Tell me.

2131
02:20:57.746 --> 02:20:59.746
I just, I thought...

2132
02:21:01.336 --> 02:21:03.876
I thought I'd feel relieved.

2133
02:21:07.536 --> 02:21:09.376
It doesn't come right away.

2134
02:21:11.496 --> 02:21:12.666
Sure?

2135
02:21:12.836 --> 02:21:13.916
Not sure.

2136
02:21:17.286 --> 02:21:19.746
It's just, you know,
when you lose, you lose.


2137
02:21:20.336 --> 02:21:22.286
It's the worst thing that can happen,

2138
02:21:22.456 --> 02:21:23.876
and if you win...

2139
02:21:26.456 --> 02:21:29.416
you expect some reward.

2140
02:21:30.956 --> 02:21:32.416
But there isn't any.

2141
02:21:33.246 --> 02:21:34.416
It's just...

2142
02:21:36.286 --> 02:21:37.706
It's just over.

2143
02:21:42.666 --> 02:21:45.456
Maybe sometimes,
we expect too much.


2144
02:21:48.746 --> 02:21:49.996
Yeah, maybe.

2145
02:22:55.746 --> 02:22:56.996
Hi.

2146
02:22:57.996 --> 02:22:59.336
Sorry.

2147
02:23:01.286 --> 02:23:03.876
He tried to wait up but fell asleep.

2148
02:23:53.166 --> 02:23:54.706
I'll be going now.

2149
02:23:54.876 --> 02:23:56.086
Not staying over?

2150
02:23:56.246 --> 02:23:58.126
No, I'll leave you be.

2151
02:24:04.456 --> 02:24:05.626
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


2152
02:24:22.786 --> 02:24:24.916
I was afraid of you coming home.

2153
02:24:26.666 --> 02:24:29.786
Me too,
I was afraid to come home.
