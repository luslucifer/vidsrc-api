00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:25.590
<i>Ain't but one kind of blues.</i>

2
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:30.094
<i>And that consisted between</i>

3
00:00:30.678 --> 00:00:33.806
<i>male and female that's in love.</i>

4
00:00:34.724 --> 00:00:38.853
<i>In love, just like
I sung one of them songs a while ago</i>


5
00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:43.107
<i>and I put a verse in there
saying that love hide all fault</i>


6
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:45.860
<i>and make you do things
you don't wanna do.</i>


7
00:00:45.902 --> 00:00:49.530
<i>Love sometimes
will leave you feeling sad and blue.</i>


8
00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:52.867
<i>I'm talking about the blues!
I ain't talking about monkey junk.</i>


9
00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.038
<i>And it consisted
between male and female.</i>


10
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:02.669
<i>And that means two people,
supposed to be in love</i>


11
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.380
<i>when one or the other</i>

12
00:01:06.297 --> 00:01:10.468
<i>deceives the other through their love.</i>

13
00:02:17.493 --> 00:02:18.703
Ronnie?

14
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:25.418
Are you okay? Baby?

15
00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:30.173
Baby. Baby.

16
00:02:30.256 --> 00:02:32.550
It's okay. It's okay.

17
00:02:33.926 --> 00:02:36.304
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

18
00:02:37.138 --> 00:02:38.222
<i>It's okay.</i>

19
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.145
I never laid a
hand on her in anger.

20
00:02:44.854 --> 00:02:48.566
Not one time, R.L.
Not even when I was drinking.


21
00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:50.234
But this here business
got me wondering


22
00:02:50.318 --> 00:02:52.320
what a good shake and slap
would do for her.


23
00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:54.322
We gonna keep that talk
between us now.


24
00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:56.157
Don't you go in there
with that shit on your tongue.


25
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.159
I ain't start this shit, R.L.

26
00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.873
You wanna pray with me
before you go in, Laz?


27
00:03:08.503 --> 00:03:12.340
Heavenly Father, we do not question
your divine plan for us,


28
00:03:12.423 --> 00:03:15.968
but in these times,
when our spirit lies in shadow,


29
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.055
when we are lost,
we ask for your strength.


30
00:03:19.138 --> 00:03:22.809
We ask for strength
to surpass all understanding.


31
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.312
In your name we pray. Amen.

32
00:03:35.905 --> 00:03:38.991
Can't remember the last time
I saw you in that suit.


33
00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:40.910
At your mamma's funeral.

34
00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:43.412
I was a pallbearer, remember?

35
00:03:43.496 --> 00:03:45.998
How about I get you folks some coffee
before I take your order?


36
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.751
We won't be staying long.
Coffee will be fine.


37
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.424
We leaving this weekend.
Deke got a friend in Mobile...


38
00:03:55.508 --> 00:03:57.176
You gonna talk about that motherfucker,

39
00:03:57.218 --> 00:03:58.886
I'm just gonna get up
and leave you sitting here


40
00:03:58.928 --> 00:04:00.263
in that new shit he bought you.

41
00:04:00.346 --> 00:04:02.348
I thought we was gonna be friendly
about this.


42
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.975
You sneaking around behind my back,

43
00:04:04.058 --> 00:04:06.894
got everybody in town
looking at me like I'm a fool.


44
00:04:06.936 --> 00:04:09.063
What's friendly about that?

45
00:04:09.772 --> 00:04:12.275
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz.

46
00:04:12.358 --> 00:04:16.070
Living with you, I feel it.
Like I'm one foot in the dirt.


47
00:04:17.071 --> 00:04:20.074
Saw what happened to my mamma,
and that's not gonna happen to me.


48
00:04:20.116 --> 00:04:21.742
I got living to do.

49
00:04:21.784 --> 00:04:24.453
And you gonna do that living with him.

50
00:04:26.038 --> 00:04:27.415
Look, Rose,

51
00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:31.377
when folk get sick,
they do what they can


52
00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.379
to get on the mend, get well.

53
00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:36.716
Our marriage, it just done got sick.

54
00:04:36.757 --> 00:04:38.593
Don't talk to me about sick!

55
00:04:38.718 --> 00:04:41.429
I ain't been right
since I moved into that drafty house.


56
00:04:41.512 --> 00:04:42.805
Keeps the heat on.

57
00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.641
That damn, rusty radiator
about burned the skin off my legs.


58
00:04:45.725 --> 00:04:48.519
- Kept us warm for 12 years.
- Laz, you can't say nothing that's...


59
00:04:48.603 --> 00:04:50.855
Look, look, look.
Look, maybe we can do like R.L. said,


60
00:04:50.938 --> 00:04:53.065
come down to the church
and get with one of them counselors.


61
00:04:53.107 --> 00:04:54.859
I don't love you no more.

62
00:05:00.364 --> 00:05:02.241
I'm sorry you hurting.

63
00:05:03.743 --> 00:05:05.369
I said my piece.

64
00:05:07.955 --> 00:05:09.498
God forgive you
for what you done to me.


65
00:05:09.582 --> 00:05:10.625
Let me go.

66
00:05:10.708 --> 00:05:13.127
My daddy told me
a younger woman would bleed me dry,


67
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:14.378
and that's what you've done.

68
00:05:14.462 --> 00:05:17.423
- Laz, I said let...
- You better pray, gal.


69
00:05:17.465 --> 00:05:20.301
You hear me? You best pray.

70
00:05:20.343 --> 00:05:22.470
Don't you lay a curse on me!

71
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:25.806
Yeah, go on, look.

72
00:05:25.848 --> 00:05:28.809
See if I give a shit
about any of you people!


73
00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:49.497
- You still want a lift?
- Yeah.


74
00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:52.375
Transmission's shot.

75
00:06:03.552 --> 00:06:04.637
Hey.

76
00:06:06.097 --> 00:06:08.683
Make sure you go see my Aunt Lori.
You gotta get rid of that cough.


77
00:06:08.766 --> 00:06:10.351
This ain't gonna work.

78
00:06:10.977 --> 00:06:12.228
- Rae...
- I don't see why we gotta


79
00:06:12.311 --> 00:06:14.355
pretend about it when you and I
both know it ain't gonna work.


80
00:06:14.438 --> 00:06:16.524
- Rae, please don't do this, okay?
- It's stupid!


81
00:06:16.607 --> 00:06:18.734
- Rae. Rae!
- It's so fucking stupid!


82
00:06:23.364 --> 00:06:26.492
Look it. I got something for us, okay?

83
00:06:26.534 --> 00:06:28.202
Give me your hand.

84
00:06:29.412 --> 00:06:31.122
Give me your hand.

85
00:06:33.124 --> 00:06:34.250
Look.

86
00:06:40.631 --> 00:06:41.716
See?

87
00:06:42.883 --> 00:06:46.429
Both these watches are gonna beep
at the same time, every night.


88
00:06:46.512 --> 00:06:50.766
So no matter how far away we are,
we'll be thinking about each other.


89
00:06:51.517 --> 00:06:53.102
Hey, look at me.

90
00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:55.479
Look at me.

91
00:06:57.565 --> 00:07:01.402
I gotta believe we can do this,
or I ain't gonna make it.


92
00:07:03.237 --> 00:07:04.322
Okay.

93
00:07:05.573 --> 00:07:07.241
God, I love you.

94
00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:35.770
Ronnie, wait!

95
00:07:38.147 --> 00:07:39.398
Ronnie!

96
00:08:22.316 --> 00:08:23.484
Fuck.

97
00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:25.945
Uh-uh. Mmm-mmm.

98
00:08:26.946 --> 00:08:28.489
No, no.

99
00:08:58.894 --> 00:09:01.063
Hey, you got any money?

100
00:09:01.147 --> 00:09:02.982
Thought you had a man for that.

101
00:09:03.023 --> 00:09:04.942
I said we weren't gonna talk about him.

102
00:09:05.025 --> 00:09:07.153
How many times
we done done this shit?


103
00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:08.821
Look, I ain't calling you
no ho or nothing,


104
00:09:08.863 --> 00:09:10.906
but I ain't gonna let you
play me like no trick, neither.


105
00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.368
- Remember, you called me.
- Save it.


106
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.204
Save it for those dumb fuckers
you sell crack to.


107
00:09:19.457 --> 00:09:21.292
How much money you need, ho?

108
00:09:21.375 --> 00:09:22.877
The hell you call me?

109
00:09:26.046 --> 00:09:29.425
You wanna get rough, huh?
Is that what you doing?


110
00:09:30.426 --> 00:09:32.970
Tehronne. Tehronne, let me go.
Let me go!


111
00:09:45.316 --> 00:09:46.400
Bye.

112
00:10:31.028 --> 00:10:32.112
It's already noon, Rae.

113
00:10:32.154 --> 00:10:33.739
You think them shorts
should still be on?


114
00:10:33.781 --> 00:10:37.409
Well, if they weren't, you could
kiss my rebel cootch, you faggot.


115
00:10:42.164 --> 00:10:43.958
Cough drops or condoms?

116
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.879
I didn't know you was working here.

117
00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:53.259
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

118
00:10:55.302 --> 00:10:58.556
I just love getting dressed up
in these goddamn blue vests.


119
00:11:02.977 --> 00:11:05.688
Your meal ticket get shipped out today?

120
00:11:10.025 --> 00:11:12.820
Just let me know
if I can be of any assistance.


121
00:11:17.074 --> 00:11:19.660
Here you go, Linc.
Keep the change on that.


122
00:11:20.661 --> 00:11:21.954
Thanks, Mr. Laz.

123
00:11:21.996 --> 00:11:24.456
But if you wanna tip me,
best do it in butter beans.


124
00:11:24.498 --> 00:11:26.208
Mamma wants a bag of yours.

125
00:11:26.292 --> 00:11:28.586
"None of that store-bought junk."
That's what she said.


126
00:11:28.669 --> 00:11:30.588
All right, you keep the change anyhow.

127
00:11:30.671 --> 00:11:32.840
Come on out to the house,
I'll load you up.


128
00:11:32.881 --> 00:11:34.174
Yes, sir.

129
00:12:39.573 --> 00:12:42.618
Why y'all stop having dances
on Saturday night?


130
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:45.704
You used to have live bands
and all kind of shit.


131
00:12:45.746 --> 00:12:47.498
Feels like a wake up in here now.

132
00:12:47.581 --> 00:12:51.585
Folks can dance if they want.
I didn't buy that mirror ball for nothing.


133
00:12:51.627 --> 00:12:54.213
Y'all seen my snakeskin shoes?

134
00:12:54.254 --> 00:12:56.632
- They from New York.
- Yeah.


135
00:12:56.715 --> 00:12:58.967
My niece,
she gets them on the computer.


136
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:01.929
- Is that right?
- They got blue snakes up north?


137
00:13:03.764 --> 00:13:06.475
No. They got blue dye, though.

138
00:13:06.558 --> 00:13:09.770
You think them boots on your feet
come from a black cow?


139
00:13:09.853 --> 00:13:12.564
You wanna get on somebody
about live music?


140
00:13:12.606 --> 00:13:14.400
Get on old Laz there.

141
00:13:14.441 --> 00:13:17.528
He the one who got this joint shaking
back in the day.


142
00:13:17.611 --> 00:13:19.571
You ain't gotta tell me.

143
00:13:19.613 --> 00:13:21.281
Me and my girlfriends,

144
00:13:21.365 --> 00:13:24.493
we used to talk about
how hard his fingertips get


145
00:13:24.576 --> 00:13:26.912
just picking that guitar.

146
00:13:26.954 --> 00:13:29.581
They hard from picking peas,
not strings.


147
00:13:29.623 --> 00:13:31.417
And they still hard.

148
00:13:32.793 --> 00:13:37.589
Mayella, it ain't never happened.
It damn sure ain't gonna happen tonight.


149
00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:39.758
Oh, Laz, I know you hurting.

150
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.802
But you should know more than me,

151
00:13:41.885 --> 00:13:45.764
ain't no better cure for the blues
than some good pussy.


152
00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:57.860
Now that's a whole lot of woman
right there.


153
00:13:57.943 --> 00:13:59.069
Yeah.

154
00:13:59.153 --> 00:14:01.572
She sure do like to spread it around.

155
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.493
Hey, Laz.

156
00:14:07.202 --> 00:14:09.163
Me and you friends and all,

157
00:14:09.204 --> 00:14:12.666
but promise me
you'll keep your cool in my joint.


158
00:14:19.298 --> 00:14:22.134
- I'm gonna finish my beer.
- All right then.


159
00:14:26.013 --> 00:14:27.514
Mind if I sit?

160
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:39.109
Rose said that
it didn't go too well this afternoon.


161
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.112
See, I told her. 
I said, "Rose,

162
00:14:42.196 --> 00:14:44.990
"we ain't leaving
till we make peace with Laz."


163
00:14:45.032 --> 00:14:47.826
And that's the God's truth. 
I laid it down.

164
00:14:47.868 --> 00:14:50.037
- You laid it down?
- I did.


165
00:14:50.662 --> 00:14:52.122
That's funny.

166
00:14:52.873 --> 00:14:55.375
You laying it down for my wife.

167
00:14:55.417 --> 00:14:57.753
You think I wanna hurt you, Laz?

168
00:14:58.378 --> 00:15:01.215
- Man, I'd take a bullet for you!
- Would you now?


169
00:15:01.298 --> 00:15:03.634
We can put that to the test.

170
00:15:03.717 --> 00:15:07.971
Say, Bo, would you still got that
little.22 over behind the bar?


171
00:15:08.055 --> 00:15:10.057
My little brother here say
he'd take a bullet for me.


172
00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.601
All right now, slow your roll now.

173
00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:17.898
You come in here
to ease your heart, huh?


174
00:15:18.565 --> 00:15:21.026
Well, I ain't gonna help you do that.

175
00:15:21.068 --> 00:15:23.111
You took her into your bed,

176
00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:26.824
now you got to lay in it.

177
00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.374
I'll always love you, Laz.

178
00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:37.751
Till the end of my days.

179
00:15:40.045 --> 00:15:42.548
- Laz, what you doing, man?
- Laz, God damn it!


180
00:15:42.589 --> 00:15:44.758
Cain slew Abel.

181
00:15:44.842 --> 00:15:46.760
Slew him out of envy.

182
00:15:46.844 --> 00:15:49.763
God put his mark
on Cain for his sins.

183
00:15:49.805 --> 00:15:53.016
Is that what you want, Deke?
Huh? Is that what you come here for?


184
00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.104
I'll do it for you.
All you got to do is say it again.


185
00:15:57.813 --> 00:15:59.439
Say you love me.

186
00:16:00.357 --> 00:16:02.276
Say you love me, nigger!

187
00:16:28.427 --> 00:16:30.762
- Ronnie ship out this morning?
- Yeah. He's so stupid.


188
00:16:30.804 --> 00:16:31.805
Why do you think he's stupid?

189
00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:34.641
He told me he don't want nothing to do
with no military career.


190
00:16:34.683 --> 00:16:38.645
He wants to go up in Knoxville,
start an auto body shop with his uncle.


191
00:16:38.687 --> 00:16:41.899
- I said, "Let's go! Let's do it now!"
- Really?


192
00:16:41.982 --> 00:16:45.360
Shit, Ronnie knows cars.
Fixed that Buick for my Uncle Dale.


193
00:16:45.444 --> 00:16:49.281
Then he starts talking all this shit
about honor and duty. I swear.


194
00:16:49.323 --> 00:16:51.283
If he gets hurt up there,
I'm gonna kill him.


195
00:16:51.325 --> 00:16:53.368
It's not like you're married.
He ain't even proposed.


196
00:16:53.452 --> 00:16:54.786
He don't give a shit about me.

197
00:16:54.828 --> 00:16:57.497
I begged him not to go.
I fucking begged him.


198
00:16:57.539 --> 00:16:59.041
Oh, my God!

199
00:17:08.634 --> 00:17:10.677
Hey, you all right?

200
00:17:10.719 --> 00:17:13.138
- Yeah. I'm okay.
- You wanna go home?


201
00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:16.683
No, it just gets worse there,
leaving me to my own head.


202
00:17:26.068 --> 00:17:28.195
- Better?
- Yeah.


203
00:17:28.278 --> 00:17:30.906
- Hey, Jess.
- Hey, Batson.


204
00:17:30.989 --> 00:17:33.075
You Robotripping tonight?

205
00:17:33.158 --> 00:17:35.327
No, but I will smoke that joint.

206
00:17:35.369 --> 00:17:38.705
Well, check this out.
I got eight packs of DXM.


207
00:17:38.747 --> 00:17:39.998
I got OxyContin.

208
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.794
I got a whole shitload of Coricidin
if you wanna get out-of-body and all.


209
00:17:43.877 --> 00:17:46.630
Coricidin? You're just trying to get me
out of my clothes.


210
00:17:46.713 --> 00:17:49.091
- I'll be right back, okay?
- All right.


211
00:17:52.094 --> 00:17:55.097
- Hey.
- What you want?


212
00:17:56.807 --> 00:17:59.393
Ain't no reason I can't go out
and have fun with my friends.


213
00:17:59.434 --> 00:18:01.979
What, you think
I'm Ronnie's spy or something?


214
00:18:02.896 --> 00:18:05.565
Come tomorrow, his dumb ass
gonna be halfway around the world


215
00:18:05.649 --> 00:18:08.276
trying to keep his head
on his shoulders.


216
00:18:08.694 --> 00:18:11.363
You think
he's gonna be thinking about you?


217
00:18:12.948 --> 00:18:14.491
You go to hell.

218
00:18:17.619 --> 00:18:20.247
Hey, how many to get me fucked up?

219
00:19:58.386 --> 00:20:01.765
<i>Just like a bird
without a feather</i>


220
00:20:06.686 --> 00:20:10.023
<i>You know I'm lost without your love</i>

221
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.448
<i>Just like a bird without a feather</i>

222
00:20:23.161 --> 00:20:26.081
<i>You know I'm lost without your love</i>

223
00:20:30.877 --> 00:20:33.463
<i>You know I need your lovin'</i>

224
00:20:35.048 --> 00:20:38.385
<i>Just like the angels need heaven above</i>

225
00:20:46.393 --> 00:20:48.520
<i>Well, I done shot that woman</i>

226
00:20:51.815 --> 00:20:55.026
<i>Shot her 'cause she done me wrong</i>

227
00:21:02.784 --> 00:21:06.121
<i>Yeah, I love that woman</i>

228
00:21:07.747 --> 00:21:11.042
<i>Says she ain't love no one but me</i>

229
00:21:19.092 --> 00:21:22.387
<i>Yeah, but I caught that woman cheatin'</i>

230
00:21:24.764 --> 00:21:28.018
<i>Now our home ain't
where it used to be</i>

231
00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.284
<i>Jess!</i>

232
00:21:47.704 --> 00:21:50.498
Jess! Jess!

233
00:21:57.464 --> 00:21:58.590
Stop!

234
00:22:00.467 --> 00:22:02.093
- Stop! Stop!
- Stop what?


235
00:22:02.135 --> 00:22:05.138
Stop. I'm spinning. Don't.

236
00:22:09.935 --> 00:22:12.479
Oh, God, that feels so much better.

237
00:22:27.577 --> 00:22:29.412
Come on, I'll take you home.

238
00:22:43.385 --> 00:22:45.845
Thought you had
some shorts on earlier.


239
00:22:47.013 --> 00:22:48.515
I got others.

240
00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:51.893
This thing you got...

241
00:22:57.357 --> 00:23:01.319
I've heard people say you'd fuck a tree
if it was handy. I can see that.


242
00:23:02.737 --> 00:23:05.865
But that nigger, Tehronne?

243
00:23:10.537 --> 00:23:12.247
He thinks he's some player

244
00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:15.500
'cause he hustles dope
and stolen hubcaps, I mean,


245
00:23:15.542 --> 00:23:18.044
I can see a tree. 
But that piece of shit?

246
00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.547
I begged him not to go.

247
00:23:22.215 --> 00:23:23.425
But he went.

248
00:23:23.508 --> 00:23:25.218
I begged him.

249
00:23:25.302 --> 00:23:27.178
I bet you did.

250
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.889
Just had to get
that black cock up in you.


251
00:23:38.773 --> 00:23:40.275
That's not...

252
00:23:43.194 --> 00:23:45.363
What the fuck you laughing at?

253
00:23:45.405 --> 00:23:48.241
You ain't got a half
of what Tehronne got.


254
00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:52.412
Not a half.

255
00:24:00.253 --> 00:24:01.421
Get up!

256
00:24:02.422 --> 00:24:04.049
I ain't playing!

257
00:24:06.134 --> 00:24:08.928
You gotta open your goddamn eyes!
God damn it!


258
00:24:19.898 --> 00:24:21.399
Jesus Christ.

259
00:24:45.215 --> 00:24:46.966
Hey, man, wake up.

260
00:25:15.995 --> 00:25:18.081
- Lazarus.
<i>- Bojo called.</i>


261
00:25:18.748 --> 00:25:23.336
Said you got to see your brother
at the long end of a broken bottle.


262
00:25:24.003 --> 00:25:27.549
What, you call to preach me
about turning the other cheek now?


263
00:25:27.632 --> 00:25:31.261
I think you did all right by God,
under the circumstances.


264
00:25:33.179 --> 00:25:36.516
Your people are here for you, Laz.
This is your home.


265
00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:39.102
<i>Ain't no shame
in showing your face around here.</i>


266
00:25:39.185 --> 00:25:40.770
Yeah, all right.

267
00:25:42.939 --> 00:25:44.107
Shit.

268
00:27:25.208 --> 00:27:26.459
Oh, shit!

269
00:27:45.687 --> 00:27:47.105
Little lady?

270
00:27:48.147 --> 00:27:50.066
Little lady, listen to me. Miss.

271
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:53.486
Miss, now, I need you to open
your eyes for me, all right?


272
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.489
Come on now. Open your eyes.
Now, you can do that for me, can't you?


273
00:27:56.531 --> 00:27:58.575
Come on. Come on.

274
00:27:58.658 --> 00:28:00.493
There you go. Just like that.

275
00:28:00.577 --> 00:28:01.703
That's good.

276
00:28:01.786 --> 00:28:03.496
- Tehronne.
- Huh?


277
00:28:03.538 --> 00:28:06.124
- Tehronne.
- Tehronne?


278
00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:09.544
He did... He did... 
He didn't do this to...

279
00:28:12.422 --> 00:28:13.881
It's all right.

280
00:28:16.092 --> 00:28:20.013
I'm fixing to go to town and get
some medicines so I can fix you up.


281
00:28:21.097 --> 00:28:23.057
You just rest, all right?

282
00:28:24.225 --> 00:28:26.352
Just try to get some sleep.

283
00:28:27.186 --> 00:28:29.314
Take that chill off of you.

284
00:28:31.274 --> 00:28:32.525
God damn.

285
00:29:06.684 --> 00:29:10.146
- Lazarus?
- Miss Angie. You gave me a start.


286
00:29:10.229 --> 00:29:13.691
I'm sorry, it's these soft shoes
I wear for my back.


287
00:29:13.733 --> 00:29:16.069
- You hurt your back?
- No, no, I'm standing most of my day.


288
00:29:16.152 --> 00:29:18.071
They're just for support.

289
00:29:18.154 --> 00:29:20.198
Didn't see you in church this morning.

290
00:29:20.239 --> 00:29:23.910
Oh, I'm real busy with the crops.

291
00:29:23.993 --> 00:29:27.747
And if I don't work on Sunday,
then I have to hire some extra hands.


292
00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:30.416
Well, it's good to see you.

293
00:29:31.376 --> 00:29:33.002
Look here, Miss Angela,

294
00:29:33.836 --> 00:29:37.507
my little niece,
she got a real bad cough.


295
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.301
- You take her to a doctor?
- No.


296
00:29:40.385 --> 00:29:43.388
She can't go...
Well, ain't no money for a doctor.


297
00:29:43.429 --> 00:29:46.933
Her daddy off work
and he asked me to take care of her.


298
00:29:48.267 --> 00:29:50.603
I don't... I don't know what to do.

299
00:29:51.604 --> 00:29:53.189
You wait right here.

300
00:31:25.239 --> 00:31:28.034
Is your niece older than 12?

301
00:31:28.117 --> 00:31:31.287
Okay. My sister got a bad cough
with her pneumonia


302
00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:32.830
so I just copied her prescription.

303
00:31:32.872 --> 00:31:35.875
You don't need to pay anything.
Just take it.


304
00:31:35.958 --> 00:31:38.753
And if she gets worse,
you give me a call.


305
00:31:38.836 --> 00:31:40.838
I put my number on the bottle.

306
00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.552
You ain't gonna get into no trouble
about this, is you?


307
00:31:46.594 --> 00:31:48.429
Not if no one finds out.

308
00:32:05.822 --> 00:32:08.574
Hey, Laz.
You know we closed on Sunday, man.


309
00:32:08.616 --> 00:32:10.743
I need to talk to Tehronne.

310
00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.537

Come on back, Cuz.

313
00:32:20.044 --> 00:32:23.798
You call it a game
when one man wins each time?


314
00:32:25.424 --> 00:32:27.802
I call it a motherfucking shame.

315
00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.639
- What you want?
- Can I get a word?


316
00:32:33.683 --> 00:32:34.934
Come on.

317
00:32:43.401 --> 00:32:46.946
- You want some weed?
- No, man, I don't mess with that stuff.


318
00:32:48.364 --> 00:32:50.908
You know a white girl about yay high,

319
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.703
dirty blonde hair
split down the middle like?


320
00:32:53.786 --> 00:32:55.788
That ain't up to me
to hook you up, pop.

321
00:32:55.872 --> 00:32:57.874
- She on her own, you know?
- Huh?


322
00:32:57.957 --> 00:33:00.042
I don't pimp that.

323
00:33:00.126 --> 00:33:02.336
But if you talking about
who I think you talking about,


324
00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.131
you talking about Rae. Rae Doole.

325
00:33:05.923 --> 00:33:08.259
Sexy little split tail, like you say.

326
00:33:08.801 --> 00:33:12.388
Can't hook you up with that.
But I do got two ho.


327
00:33:12.471 --> 00:33:14.181
One of them ain't in town

328
00:33:14.265 --> 00:33:17.143
and the other one pregnant,
so you on your own.


329
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:20.563
Well, this Rae, you get with her?

330
00:33:20.646 --> 00:33:23.482
- Shit, man, who ain't fucked her?
- What you mean?


331
00:33:23.566 --> 00:33:26.986
Man, she got a spare minute,
she snatch up anybody.


332
00:33:27.028 --> 00:33:30.448
Sometime she needs the real deal,
so she calls me up.


333
00:33:31.073 --> 00:33:34.160
Girl got a itch, you know?
What's a nigger to do?


334
00:33:36.203 --> 00:33:39.707
Now this girl, 
Rae, she like it rough?

335
00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:41.375
You know, like beating on her
or whatnot?


336
00:33:41.459 --> 00:33:42.627
That ain't my scene.

337
00:33:42.668 --> 00:33:44.420
- That something you into?
- No.


338
00:33:44.503 --> 00:33:47.423
See, look, nigger, that girl's in my favor.

339
00:33:47.506 --> 00:33:49.717
You fuck with her rough,
you got me to fuck with.


340
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.678
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Collar that dog, boy.


341
00:33:52.762 --> 00:33:55.806
I don't wanna mess with her.
I just wanna know who she is, that's all.


342
00:33:55.848 --> 00:33:59.727
Like I say, you wanna hook up with that,
I ain't in your way.


343
00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:02.772
That switch of hers
been all over town anyway.


344
00:34:02.855 --> 00:34:05.733
- She got that sickness, you know?
- What sickness?


345
00:34:06.609 --> 00:34:11.155
What I'm saying is,
she gotta get dick or she goes crazy.


346
00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:15.242
Get my money ready, nigger.

347
00:34:19.538 --> 00:34:20.665
Miss?

348
00:34:21.958 --> 00:34:23.250
Miss Rae?

349
00:34:25.044 --> 00:34:26.921
Hey! Hey, you hear me?

350
00:34:29.966 --> 00:34:31.550
Come here. Come on.

351
00:34:32.718 --> 00:34:34.428
Come on now. Hey.

Hey, listen to me.
Look me in the eye now. Come on.


354
00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:43.020
Look at me.

355
00:34:43.062 --> 00:34:45.940
See, ain't no harm here. 
Ain't no harm.

356
00:34:46.023 --> 00:34:48.025
All I wanna do is get you well.

357
00:34:48.818 --> 00:34:52.154
My name is Lazarus. Lazarus Redd.

358
00:34:52.238 --> 00:34:55.032
- Lazarus.
- That's right. My name is Lazarus.


359
00:34:55.074 --> 00:34:56.701
- Lazarus Redd.
- Lazarus.


360
00:34:56.742 --> 00:34:59.954
And I'm gonna take good care of you,
all right? Okay?


361
00:35:07.336 --> 00:35:10.089
Lazarus! Lazarus!

362
00:35:10.923 --> 00:35:12.216
Lazarus!

363
00:35:12.633 --> 00:35:14.927
Get off me! Get off me!

364
00:35:18.347 --> 00:35:21.267
See if I give a shit
about any of you people!


365
00:35:43.456 --> 00:35:46.792
Lazarus! Lazarus!

366
00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.462
Lazarus!

367
00:36:33.964 --> 00:36:36.592
I know. I know it hurts. 
I know it hurts!

368
00:36:36.675 --> 00:36:38.177
We gotta break that fever!

369
00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.054
I ain't gonna let you die!

370
00:36:40.137 --> 00:36:42.807
I ain't letting you die!

371
00:36:42.848 --> 00:36:44.350
Now breathe.

372
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:47.686
Come on. Breathe now. Calm down.

373
00:36:50.147 --> 00:36:52.775
There you go. You cooling off already.

374
00:36:53.234 --> 00:36:57.029
Girl, you put the fear
of the devil in me.

375
00:36:57.571 --> 00:37:01.242
I was scared as a kid
on Halloween night in the graveyard.


376
00:37:24.306 --> 00:37:25.516
Ronnie?

377
00:37:32.731 --> 00:37:33.858
Ronnie?

378
00:37:36.652 --> 00:37:39.155
Ronnie, where did you go?
Where did you go?


379
00:37:40.406 --> 00:37:41.740
Where did you go?

380
00:37:42.575 --> 00:37:45.578
Where did you go, Ronnie?
Where did you go?


381
00:37:47.538 --> 00:37:48.747
Ronnie?

382
00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.749
Ronnie?

383
00:37:52.918 --> 00:37:55.504
Ronnie!

384
00:37:58.215 --> 00:38:00.009
Ronnie!

385
00:38:00.092 --> 00:38:01.719
Say, gal...

386
00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:02.887
Hey.

387
00:38:03.846 --> 00:38:06.098
Is you hearing the sound of my voice?

388
00:38:06.974 --> 00:38:08.934
You traveling now, girl.

389
00:38:09.852 --> 00:38:12.563
Why don't you come on back
in the house with me now?


390
00:38:12.605 --> 00:38:14.273
Come on now.

391
00:38:14.315 --> 00:38:15.441
Come on!

392
00:38:15.524 --> 00:38:18.110
Hey. Hey. Hey. 
Hey, you all right?

393
00:38:18.194 --> 00:38:22.281
Whoa, whoa, whoa now.
Come on. Hey, hey.


394
00:38:27.453 --> 00:38:30.122
It's all right. It's all right. 
It's all right.

395
00:38:30.206 --> 00:38:32.291
Come on. Come on.

396
00:38:35.002 --> 00:38:37.171
You all right. 
You all right.

397
00:38:45.471 --> 00:38:48.474
It's all right now. It's okay.
Just rest, all right.


398
00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.145
It's okay.

399
00:38:54.647 --> 00:38:56.315
It's okay.

400
00:38:56.357 --> 00:38:58.150
- Oh, no, no, no.
- It's okay.


401
00:38:58.901 --> 00:39:01.987
Hey. Hey.
We ain't gonna do that, all right?


402
00:39:03.614 --> 00:39:06.492
Here you go, Rae. 
You're safe now.

403
00:39:07.743 --> 00:39:09.828
Listen. Listen. Listen here.

404
00:39:10.579 --> 00:39:12.498
<i>I went</i>

405
00:39:14.083 --> 00:39:16.627
<i>Down to the church house</i>

406
00:39:18.337 --> 00:39:20.422
<i>I heard a voice</i>

407
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:23.592
<i>Tell me to pray</i>

408
00:39:24.468 --> 00:39:27.513
<i>I got down on my knees</i>

409
00:39:28.347 --> 00:39:31.183
<i>But I had no words to say</i>

410
00:39:32.518 --> 00:39:34.687
<i>No words to say</i>

411
00:39:36.188 --> 00:39:38.399
<i>You know I could not pray</i>

412
00:40:42.755 --> 00:40:45.883
<i>If I, I was a catfish</i>

413
00:40:46.884 --> 00:40:49.803
<i>Swimming, Lord, in the deep blue sea</i>

414
00:40:50.554 --> 00:40:54.016
<i>I'd have all you big leg women</i>

415
00:40:54.099 --> 00:40:56.185
<i>Fishing after me</i>

416
00:40:56.268 --> 00:40:57.936
<i>Fishing after me</i>

417
00:41:02.191 --> 00:41:05.944
<i>Well, there's two, two trains runnin'</i>

418
00:41:06.612 --> 00:41:09.281
<i>They run, they run my way</i>

419
00:41:09.865 --> 00:41:12.242
<i>You know one run 'round midnight</i>

420
00:41:12.284 --> 00:41:14.912
<i>The other run just 'fore day,
just 'fore day</i>


421
00:41:15.621 --> 00:41:18.582
<i>That train, 
Lord, took my baby away</i>

422
00:41:19.291 --> 00:41:21.210
<i>Took my baby away</i>

423
00:42:17.433 --> 00:42:19.309
Whoa, whoa, whoa, now.

424
00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.563
Just take it easy. 
Don't go too fast.

425
00:42:23.188 --> 00:42:25.190
How long I been out?

426
00:42:25.232 --> 00:42:28.360
You been in and out, I don't know,
I guess two days.


427
00:42:29.319 --> 00:42:30.487
Two days?

428
00:42:30.529 --> 00:42:33.157
Well, you wake up in spells, you know.

429
00:42:33.198 --> 00:42:36.201
Just long enough to get
some of this medicine in you.


430
00:42:37.244 --> 00:42:39.329
Can you turn that shit off?

431
00:42:40.038 --> 00:42:41.373
Oh, yeah.

432
00:42:48.046 --> 00:42:50.549
Found you out by
the side of the road.

433
00:42:50.591 --> 00:42:53.886
Looked like somebody
took to beating on you pretty bad.


434
00:42:53.927 --> 00:42:56.388
You know who done that to you?

435
00:42:56.472 --> 00:42:59.057
- Where's Ronnie?
- I don't know who that is.


436
00:42:59.099 --> 00:43:01.560
No, wait, wait. He left.

437
00:43:06.398 --> 00:43:10.235
I don't got any money or anything,
you know, for fixing me up.


438
00:43:10.319 --> 00:43:12.237
I don't need none.

439
00:43:12.321 --> 00:43:14.573
I guess I best be on my way.

440
00:43:14.656 --> 00:43:17.910
- I think we need to talk some.
- No, sir.


441
00:43:17.951 --> 00:43:19.119
I gotta be on my way.

442
00:43:19.203 --> 00:43:21.663
Best to get your wits about you before...

443
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.252
I wanted to tell you about that.

444
00:43:28.295 --> 00:43:30.255
Why you got me chained?

445
00:43:39.973 --> 00:43:41.600
What the fuck you been doing to me?

446
00:43:41.642 --> 00:43:44.102
I ain't laid a hand on you,
except to break your fever.


447
00:43:44.186 --> 00:43:46.438
- Like I said...
- Get this goddamn chain off me!


448
00:43:46.522 --> 00:43:49.233
Look, girl, you been running wild on me!

449
00:43:49.274 --> 00:43:51.818
Between them fits
and them fever dreams you having,


450
00:43:51.902 --> 00:43:53.779
I been chasing you
all over this place at night.


451
00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:56.281
Well, I'm woke now.
You can take this off.


452
00:43:58.784 --> 00:44:01.620
No. You ain't right yet.

453
00:44:01.662 --> 00:44:04.456
I'm right enough
to stand on my own two feet.


454
00:44:04.498 --> 00:44:06.959
Now get this goddamn chain off me!

455
00:44:08.377 --> 00:44:11.004
Why you let them mens
treat you like that?


456
00:44:12.214 --> 00:44:13.298
What?

457
00:44:13.382 --> 00:44:16.843
All them mens you up under,
why you let them do you like that?


458
00:44:19.805 --> 00:44:21.807
What the hell you know about me?

459
00:44:22.975 --> 00:44:25.018
You ain't got no right
to talk to me about that shit!


460
00:44:25.102 --> 00:44:27.521
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- I saved your life, girl!


461
00:44:27.604 --> 00:44:30.440
I can do or say
whatever the fuck I want!

462
00:44:32.067 --> 00:44:35.112
Now, I done give you enough chain
so you can get around the house here.


463
00:44:35.153 --> 00:44:38.198
You can get to the kitchen.
Bathroom, back yonder.


464
00:44:38.282 --> 00:44:39.992
You got enough food around here.

465
00:44:40.033 --> 00:44:43.078
A few more swallows left
in that medicine over there.


466
00:44:43.161 --> 00:44:47.958
Whatever you want, you know,
if you wanna have me, you can take me.


467
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.796
I'll do whatever you like.
Just, when you're done, I gotta go.


468
00:44:52.838 --> 00:44:56.341
You know?
'Cause I can't stay here with you.


469
00:44:56.425 --> 00:44:59.761
God seen fit to
put you in my path.

470
00:45:00.846 --> 00:45:04.099
And I aim to cure you
of your wickedness.


471
00:45:07.978 --> 00:45:10.981
- You some kind of pervert?
- No, ma'am.


472
00:45:11.023 --> 00:45:13.483
Some crazy Jesus freak,
gonna fuck the spirit into me?


473
00:45:13.525 --> 00:45:15.736
You watch your tongue in my house!

474
00:45:15.819 --> 00:45:17.696
- Look it, mister...
- Now, you sick!


475
00:45:17.738 --> 00:45:20.032
- You got a sickness!
- Look it, mister...


476
00:45:20.115 --> 00:45:22.242
- We done broke the fever.
- I will do whatever you want.


477
00:45:22.326 --> 00:45:24.536
Now, we gonna break the hold
the devil got on you!


478
00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:26.997
I can't stay here! 
I can't stay here!

479
00:45:29.541 --> 00:45:30.709
Help!

480
00:45:39.885 --> 00:45:41.887
Somebody help me!

481
00:46:00.572 --> 00:46:02.574
We ain't gonna be moved.

482
00:46:09.414 --> 00:46:11.249
Listen here, gal.

483
00:46:11.958 --> 00:46:14.336
I ain't gonna be moved on this.

484
00:46:17.214 --> 00:46:18.465
Help!

485
00:46:21.718 --> 00:46:23.428
Let me go!

486
00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:26.765
You can holler all you want.
Ain't nobody gonna hear you.


487
00:46:26.848 --> 00:46:28.975
Ain't gonna bend my will, neither.

488
00:46:29.559 --> 00:46:30.936
Right or wrong,

489
00:46:32.813 --> 00:46:34.272
you gonna mind me.

490
00:46:34.356 --> 00:46:37.442
Like Jesus says, 
I'm gonna suffer you.

491
00:46:37.526 --> 00:46:39.194
I'm gonna suffer you!

492
00:46:40.237 --> 00:46:42.489
Get your ass back in my house!

493
00:46:46.743 --> 00:46:47.953
Or what?

494
00:46:50.122 --> 00:46:51.415
Or what?

495
00:47:17.149 --> 00:47:20.318
- Quit it! It hurts!
- Now, whose doing is that?


496
00:47:30.704 --> 00:47:32.831
God damn it! Okay!

497
00:47:43.008 --> 00:47:44.384
You hungry?

498
00:47:56.646 --> 00:47:59.524
I put a lot of backache
into growing them greens.


499
00:48:00.567 --> 00:48:02.861
Some love into cooking the rest of it.

500
00:48:03.695 --> 00:48:06.281
If you slow down,
you might taste some of it.


501
00:48:25.217 --> 00:48:26.843
Oh, you like this?

502
00:48:26.885 --> 00:48:29.387
Walking me through this field all day
like I was your mule?


503
00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:31.640
Can't lay around on the sofa all day.

504
00:48:31.723 --> 00:48:33.600
Gotta get your legs strong.

505
00:48:33.683 --> 00:48:36.353
If I break one, you gonna shoot me?

506
00:48:56.164 --> 00:48:58.959
My daddy was one of
the first mens in these parts


507
00:48:59.042 --> 00:49:01.795
to start a soil conservation group.

508
00:49:01.878 --> 00:49:06.216
They got a group of farmers together,
every year they rotate the crops.


509
00:49:07.175 --> 00:49:09.052
Know why they do that?

510
00:49:10.095 --> 00:49:11.972
Keep the soil healthy.

511
00:49:13.223 --> 00:49:15.600
- That sting?
- Itches.


512
00:49:15.684 --> 00:49:17.602
That mean it's healing.

513
00:49:20.272 --> 00:49:25.277
Now, I done seen it in nature
and I done seen it in men.


514
00:49:26.528 --> 00:49:30.073
You gots to change, rotate the crop.

515
00:49:30.115 --> 00:49:33.076
Gotta have change,
else that seed won't take.


516
00:49:33.118 --> 00:49:35.412
Hell, girl, you gotta cut that shit out.

517
00:49:35.453 --> 00:49:37.622
Laying up under all them fools,

518
00:49:37.706 --> 00:49:39.958
rutting on you
like you some bitch in heat,


519
00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.668
like you somebody's dog.

520
00:49:41.751 --> 00:49:46.798
A man or woman
that enters into union with Almighty God


521
00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:48.466
in the sanctity of marriage,

522
00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:52.304
should not demean theyselves
by bending to another's will.


523
00:49:52.345 --> 00:49:54.222
Hell, girl, is you crazy?

524
00:49:54.306 --> 00:49:57.350
I ain't no saint. 
I ain't saying I ain't weak.

525
00:49:57.434 --> 00:50:01.021
I mean, playing guitar
in them blood-bucket jukes all your life,


526
00:50:01.104 --> 00:50:02.439
a nigger learn how to sin.

527
00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:05.567
And I do got sin in me.
I ain't gonna lie about that.


528
00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:07.360
But I got respect!

529
00:50:07.444 --> 00:50:10.155
And all you got in you is bile!
Just bile!


530
00:50:10.238 --> 00:50:13.199
Running around behind my back,
whoring with my brother!


531
00:50:13.283 --> 00:50:15.285
- Killing my baby!
- Get off!


532
00:50:33.178 --> 00:50:35.639
I didn't mean to go off like that.

533
00:50:38.099 --> 00:50:40.894
Why you old men gotta talk so much?

534
00:50:40.977 --> 00:50:43.647
You gotta talk yourself into fucking me?

535
00:50:43.688 --> 00:50:45.357
Like little boys.

536
00:50:46.775 --> 00:50:49.778
It's okay. I'm grown. I know.

537
00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.364
We can go slow.

538
00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.535
You gonna give me another bath?

539
00:52:58.531 --> 00:53:01.451
Well, Archie, there goes our fortune.

540
00:53:01.493 --> 00:53:04.621
Laz, we've been doing good
since you been away.


541
00:53:07.457 --> 00:53:09.667
What time Ella Mae's open up?

542
00:53:09.751 --> 00:53:12.212
You needing to buy some pantyhose?

543
00:53:13.171 --> 00:53:15.298
Couple of dresses, actually.

544
00:53:35.443 --> 00:53:38.738
- May I help you, sir?
- Yessum.


545
00:53:38.822 --> 00:53:42.450
I'm looking to get some things
for a woman.


546
00:53:42.534 --> 00:53:47.122
You know, some dresses and such
and maybe some shoes.


547
00:53:47.205 --> 00:53:51.376
But they gotta be nice things,
you know, proper things for a woman.


548
00:53:51.459 --> 00:53:54.671
You know, things that make a woman
feel like a woman


549
00:53:54.712 --> 00:53:58.091
and not look like
a hussy or a floozy.

550
00:53:59.676 --> 00:54:02.053
Well, that makes it easier.

551
00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:19.904
Hello?

552
00:54:21.489 --> 00:54:22.615
Hey!

553
00:54:24.701 --> 00:54:25.952
Asshole.

554
00:55:00.862 --> 00:55:03.531
I just wanted to bring something
to show my appreciation.


555
00:55:03.615 --> 00:55:06.492
Some squash, tomatoes,
corn, butter beans.


556
00:55:06.576 --> 00:55:08.244
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

557
00:55:08.286 --> 00:55:11.122
Well, my niece is all better now,
thanks to you.


558
00:55:11.164 --> 00:55:13.291
That's good. I'm happy to hear it.

559
00:55:13.374 --> 00:55:16.461
Oh, and I put something special in here.

560
00:55:17.295 --> 00:55:20.006
This whipped body cream.
Got a scent to it.


561
00:55:23.301 --> 00:55:25.553
That there is ginger soufflĂ©.

562
00:55:25.637 --> 00:55:30.266
Say, you put it on
after a hot bath or shower,


563
00:55:30.308 --> 00:55:33.478
it'll make you soft, smell good.

564
00:55:33.561 --> 00:55:35.647
That's real sweet of you.

565
00:55:35.688 --> 00:55:38.233
Just hope you enjoy it.

566
00:55:38.316 --> 00:55:39.692
Thank you.

567
00:55:50.411 --> 00:55:51.579
Mr. Lazarus!

568
00:55:54.999 --> 00:55:56.334
Hey, Mr. Laz!

569
00:56:00.797 --> 00:56:02.882
I come for the butter beans!

570
00:56:12.141 --> 00:56:13.393
Mr. Laz?

571
00:56:43.673 --> 00:56:45.258
Mr. Laz, you in there?

572
00:57:47.278 --> 00:57:48.488
Mr. Laz!

573
00:57:49.739 --> 00:57:51.532
I'm coming inside!

574
00:58:27.652 --> 00:58:29.320
There now! Hush up!

575
00:58:38.913 --> 00:58:42.375
God damn! Girl, I can't leave you alone
for a minute!


576
00:58:42.458 --> 00:58:44.877
Get your ass away from around here!

577
00:58:48.131 --> 00:58:50.007
Lincoln. Lincoln!

578
00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:01.519
Was that Lincoln James
I seen running off?


579
00:59:01.602 --> 00:59:02.603
Uh-huh.

580
00:59:04.772 --> 00:59:06.399
Why his britches down
around his knees?


581
00:59:08.484 --> 00:59:09.527
R.L., you gonna have to get on.

582
00:59:10.945 --> 00:59:13.197
Can't have nobody around my place.

583
00:59:13.239 --> 00:59:15.199
You get a call from Rose?

584
00:59:15.283 --> 00:59:16.826
This ain't got nothing to do
with that woman.


585
00:59:16.868 --> 00:59:19.120
I just don't wanna be bothered
with nobody right now.


586
00:59:19.203 --> 00:59:22.957
Something wrong with your phone?
I been trying to call you for a few days.


587
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.709
Going dove hunting?

588
00:59:24.792 --> 00:59:28.379
R.L., now I done told you to get on.
I ain't playing.


589
00:59:34.343 --> 00:59:37.180
You saying that gun is
for me if I don't.

590
00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:40.433
I ain't letting you
talk me out of shit no more, R.L.


591
00:59:40.516 --> 00:59:43.728
I done made up my mind on this,
I ain't gonna be moved.


592
00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:45.855
"Ain't gonna be moved."

593
00:59:45.897 --> 00:59:48.316
There ain't no room
for preaching around here no more!


594
00:59:48.399 --> 00:59:49.984
Now, I done told you to get on!

595
00:59:50.067 --> 00:59:51.736
- Or what?
- Go on now!


596
00:59:53.738 --> 00:59:55.781
Go on. Shoot me.

597
00:59:56.491 --> 00:59:58.034
Shoot me, killer.

598
01:00:01.245 --> 01:00:04.248
I ought to stomp your ass,
pointing this thing at me.


599
01:00:07.335 --> 01:00:08.878
Damn it, Laz.

600
01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.464
I know we ain't blood,
but we was raised like brothers,


601
01:00:11.547 --> 01:00:14.133
since the very first day
we was slapped on the ass.


602
01:00:14.217 --> 01:00:16.385
Now you gonna go
point a gun at me?

603
01:00:20.264 --> 01:00:25.686
If you were in some kind of trouble,
then we gonna figure something out.


604
01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:27.271
You and me.

605
01:00:31.275 --> 01:00:33.778
Here. Go on, wipe your face off.

606
01:00:40.618 --> 01:00:43.120
This got something to do with Rose?

607
01:00:45.456 --> 01:00:46.749
Then what?

608
01:00:57.635 --> 01:00:59.345
I didn't wanna do it.

609
01:01:08.604 --> 01:01:10.898
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

610
01:01:10.982 --> 01:01:12.233
Man in your line of work

611
01:01:12.316 --> 01:01:15.027
ought to not use the Lord's name in vain
like you just did.


612
01:01:15.111 --> 01:01:17.113
A half-naked white woman
chained up in your house!


613
01:01:17.154 --> 01:01:21.242
Now look here, I found that girl beat on
and left for dead out on the road!


614
01:01:21.325 --> 01:01:22.827
I just brung her home!

615
01:01:22.868 --> 01:01:24.620
Laz, I know that girl!

616
01:01:24.662 --> 01:01:28.666
She had a whole mess of crabs
and STDs! What you thinking?


617
01:01:28.749 --> 01:01:32.420
I swear on my mamma's grave, R.L.,
I ain't touched that girl.


618
01:01:32.503 --> 01:01:34.130
My wick dry on this.

619
01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.723
You say she was beat on.
You call the Sheriff on this?


620
01:01:43.806 --> 01:01:47.602
R.L., now put yourself in my place.

621
01:01:47.685 --> 01:01:50.271
You out here by yourself with,
as you say,


622
01:01:50.354 --> 01:01:53.566
a half-naked white woman
who love to fuck.


623
01:01:53.649 --> 01:01:56.569
Now, I done been toe to toe
with the law in this town a heap of times


624
01:01:56.652 --> 01:01:58.696
just for being black and nearby.

625
01:02:00.573 --> 01:02:04.035
- What's that chain around her waist for?
- Go on in there and ask her.


626
01:02:04.827 --> 01:02:08.456
Now this girl been rut on
and beat on all her days.


627
01:02:08.539 --> 01:02:11.792
She need to talk to somebody
with some sense and some reasoning.


628
01:02:11.876 --> 01:02:13.085
That's you.

629
01:02:14.045 --> 01:02:16.213
Just go in there and talk to her.

630
01:02:18.215 --> 01:02:19.383
Please.

631
01:02:25.139 --> 01:02:27.224
And I'm fixing steaks for supper.

632
01:02:28.392 --> 01:02:30.186
I expect you to stay.

633
01:02:30.227 --> 01:02:34.231
You expect me to sit down and eat with
that woman chained up the way she is?


634
01:02:34.315 --> 01:02:36.942
R.L., you watch yourself in there.

635
01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:40.279
That gal be on your dick
like stank on shit.


636
01:02:47.995 --> 01:02:49.246
Lincoln.

637
01:02:49.872 --> 01:02:52.041
Come here, boy. Come on.

638
01:02:53.542 --> 01:02:56.504
- I ain't hurt you none, did I?
- No, sir.


639
01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.714
Look here.

640
01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:03.719
What happened up yonder at the house,
that wasn't your fault.


641
01:03:03.761 --> 01:03:06.222
Ain't a young man alive
could've kept his pants on


642
01:03:06.263 --> 01:03:08.724
with that girl in heat like she is.

643
01:03:08.766 --> 01:03:10.559
Why she got a chain on her?

644
01:03:10.601 --> 01:03:14.230
Well, now, that's between me and her,
that's private.


645
01:03:15.856 --> 01:03:16.941
So,

646
01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:21.487
- that your first time?
- Yes, sir.


647
01:03:22.279 --> 01:03:25.324
Shit! I remember my first time

648
01:03:25.408 --> 01:03:28.327
was out behind my uncle's barn
with my second cousin.


649
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:34.041
Man, that girl must've weighed two tons
if she weighed a pound.


650
01:03:34.125 --> 01:03:36.669
Could've done a lot better for myself.

651
01:03:36.752 --> 01:03:39.380
Hell, look like you sure enough did.

652
01:03:42.258 --> 01:03:44.635
- You want a cigarette?
- No, sir.


653
01:03:45.094 --> 01:03:47.304
That's usually what you do
when you get through, you know.


654
01:03:47.388 --> 01:03:49.682
You either smoke
or leave them smoking.


655
01:03:55.271 --> 01:03:58.023
- You a preacher?
- That's right.


656
01:03:59.817 --> 01:04:01.360
Can I ask you a question?

657
01:04:01.444 --> 01:04:02.445
Mmm-hmm.

658
01:04:04.238 --> 01:04:07.491
You know how people are always
saying, you gotta get right with Jesus


659
01:04:07.533 --> 01:04:09.410
if you want not to
go to hell, you know.

660
01:04:09.493 --> 01:04:13.581
Gotta say you're sorry
and Jesus will let you into heaven.


661
01:04:14.874 --> 01:04:17.001
You can put it that way.

662
01:04:17.042 --> 01:04:19.170
That's so fucking stupid.

663
01:04:19.253 --> 01:04:22.298
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to curse. I just...


664
01:04:22.339 --> 01:04:25.384
No, no, no. What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?


665
01:04:27.303 --> 01:04:30.306
You can't go around hurting people
and then just


666
01:04:30.347 --> 01:04:33.058
say you're sorry
and it all gets washed away.


667
01:04:34.351 --> 01:04:36.645
Why would heaven
want people like that?


668
01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:44.695
I'm gonna tell you something,

669
01:04:44.737 --> 01:04:47.865
and it's just gonna be
between you and me.


670
01:04:47.907 --> 01:04:51.202
I think folks
carry on about heaven too much.


671
01:04:51.243 --> 01:04:55.247
Like it's some kind of
all-you-can-eat buffet up in the clouds,


672
01:04:55.331 --> 01:04:57.500
and folks just do as they're told

673
01:04:57.541 --> 01:05:00.711
so they can eat what they want
behind some pearly gates.


674
01:05:07.551 --> 01:05:09.553
There's sin in my heart.

675
01:05:11.347 --> 01:05:13.557
There's evil in the world.

676
01:05:13.599 --> 01:05:17.561
But when I got no one, 
I talk to God.

677
01:05:19.396 --> 01:05:21.524
I ask for strength.

678
01:05:21.565 --> 01:05:23.567
I ask for forgiveness.

679
01:05:23.609 --> 01:05:27.029
Not peace at the end of my days
when I got no more life to live


680
01:05:27.071 --> 01:05:29.573
or no more good to do, but today.

681
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:32.326
Right now.

682
01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:39.083
What's your heaven?

683
01:05:44.839 --> 01:05:46.048
Ronnie.

684
01:06:19.123 --> 01:06:20.666
Holy shit.

685
01:06:27.673 --> 01:06:30.676
Hey, Jim, let's get Ronnie set up here.

686
01:06:33.721 --> 01:06:34.722
Thank you.

687
01:06:36.974 --> 01:06:38.267
Hey, Herman.

688
01:06:38.851 --> 01:06:41.979
Hey, Ronnie.
They buy you that Big Chicken Dinner?


689
01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:45.983
The what?

690
01:06:46.358 --> 01:06:48.986
They got different names
for things in the Corps


691
01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:50.988
when they trying to get rid of you.

692
01:06:51.030 --> 01:06:52.823
I don't know what
it's like in the Guard,

693
01:06:52.907 --> 01:06:57.745
but there's a thing called the
Bad Conduct Discharge, a BCD.


694
01:06:57.828 --> 01:07:00.789
It's not the same as the brig,
but it'll sure fuck you up for life


695
01:07:00.831 --> 01:07:03.667
if you ever wanna work
for the government.


696
01:07:03.751 --> 01:07:05.878
How do you get one of them deals?

697
01:07:05.961 --> 01:07:08.505
Well, blowing boys in the head...

698
01:07:08.547 --> 01:07:10.174
Whoa, whoa, whoa, son!

699
01:07:10.257 --> 01:07:12.343
I ain't saying shit about you.
I'm just talking.


700
01:07:12.426 --> 01:07:15.012
You don't know what you're
talking about, so shut the fuck up!


701
01:07:15.054 --> 01:07:17.014
All right, man. All right! 
It's all right!

702
01:07:17.056 --> 01:07:20.309
Hey, Herman. Come on, man.
He just got back. Shit.


703
01:07:20.351 --> 01:07:22.853
To get back
he had to have gone somewhere.


704
01:07:22.895 --> 01:07:24.647
- Fuck you!
- All right, man.


705
01:07:26.649 --> 01:07:29.276
- Come on, sit down.
- God damn it.


706
01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:42.289
So what happened?

707
01:07:45.417 --> 01:07:48.837
They been keeping a folder on me
'cause of my stomach.


708
01:07:49.713 --> 01:07:53.008
Like how I used to get before games
back in school.


709
01:07:55.344 --> 01:07:56.845
I can't shoot.

710
01:07:57.721 --> 01:07:59.974
I mean, target practice, I'm a pro.

711
01:08:00.057 --> 01:08:02.559
I can tag
right between the numbers, but...


712
01:08:06.438 --> 01:08:10.150
Something happens
when I get around loud noises.


713
01:08:11.026 --> 01:08:14.905
I get shaky and
start to lose my breath.

714
01:08:17.366 --> 01:08:19.284
They called it anxiety.

715
01:08:19.910 --> 01:08:21.495
Severe anxiety.

716
01:08:24.456 --> 01:08:26.542
Anyway, they sent me home.

717
01:08:31.046 --> 01:08:34.466
I guess it could be worse.
Could be coming back in a body bag.


718
01:08:35.259 --> 01:08:37.511
Hey, I can't get Rae on the phone.

719
01:08:38.887 --> 01:08:41.098
I mean, I called, she's not at home.

720
01:08:41.181 --> 01:08:42.933
None of her friends
seem to know where she is.


721
01:08:43.017 --> 01:08:44.101
She's around.

722
01:08:44.184 --> 01:08:45.269
Always is.

723
01:08:45.352 --> 01:08:47.479
I don't know. I just feel like
something bad's happened.


724
01:08:47.563 --> 01:08:50.399
You'd tell me
if you knew something, right?


725
01:08:57.656 --> 01:09:01.243
Now that's sharp. 
That is sharp.

726
01:09:01.285 --> 01:09:03.412
You ain't had no trouble with that chain,
did you?


727
01:09:03.454 --> 01:09:04.538
No.

728
01:09:08.208 --> 01:09:11.170
Well, steaks is on.

729
01:09:12.046 --> 01:09:14.089
Potatoes is boiling.

730
01:09:14.131 --> 01:09:16.925
R.L. and Lincoln are out there
grilling the corn.


731
01:09:16.967 --> 01:09:19.678
I'm about to throw these biscuits
in the oven.


732
01:09:19.762 --> 01:09:22.973
- What you know how to fix?
- I don't fucking cook.


733
01:09:23.015 --> 01:09:27.186
You know, Rae, I known a whole bunch
of hard-cussing people in my day...


734
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:30.898
All right, all right. Now, look.
I put the goddamn dress on, okay?


735
01:09:30.981 --> 01:09:33.484
I think I'm handling myself
with a little bit of fucking restraint,


736
01:09:33.525 --> 01:09:36.070
how you got me chained up here
like I'm some kind of dog!


737
01:09:36.153 --> 01:09:37.404
Rae. Rae!

738
01:09:38.447 --> 01:09:40.365
I ain't arguing with you.

739
01:09:40.449 --> 01:09:44.411
All I'm saying is
I know you got more in you than filth.


740
01:09:47.206 --> 01:09:50.084
- You saying you can't cook nothing?
- No.


741
01:09:52.294 --> 01:09:56.298
- Can you boil water?
- I think I can handle that.


742
01:09:56.381 --> 01:09:59.176
All right. Get to handling it.

743
01:10:06.058 --> 01:10:09.478
- We gonna eat with her?
- That's what I'm told.


744
01:10:12.856 --> 01:10:16.527
- She still gonna have that chain on?
- Well, I'm working on that.


745
01:10:18.195 --> 01:10:20.906
We ask you to bless this meal
put before us.


746
01:10:20.989 --> 01:10:22.866
May this food nourish our bodies

747
01:10:22.908 --> 01:10:25.035
and may the fellowship
nourish our spirit.


748
01:10:25.119 --> 01:10:27.538
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

749
01:10:27.579 --> 01:10:28.872
Amen.

750
01:10:29.706 --> 01:10:32.543
Y'all let me know
if these steaks is too dry, all right?


751
01:10:32.626 --> 01:10:35.754
And don't be shy now.
Got plenty over here.


752
01:10:35.838 --> 01:10:39.049
- This all looks wonderful.
- I skipped lunch today.


753
01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:46.181
These eggs got a little kick
to them. What you put in this?


754
01:10:46.223 --> 01:10:49.309
I expect you need
to ask the chef here.

755
01:10:49.393 --> 01:10:50.894
Cayenne pepper.

756
01:11:06.743 --> 01:11:07.870
Rae?

757
01:11:09.997 --> 01:11:11.206
Rae?

758
01:11:24.469 --> 01:11:26.221
Kitchen looks just like I left it.

759
01:11:26.263 --> 01:11:28.640
She ever tell you
she was thinking of taking off?


760
01:11:28.724 --> 01:11:31.560
You know how she gets!
With her history...


761
01:11:32.728 --> 01:11:33.979
God damn!

762
01:11:38.066 --> 01:11:40.986
I guess I could see
how she could get scared.


763
01:11:46.992 --> 01:11:48.785
All right. All right, man.

764
01:11:49.536 --> 01:11:50.871
Sit down.

765
01:12:01.798 --> 01:12:04.801
Her mamma works down
at the grocery down on the square.


766
01:12:04.885 --> 01:12:07.137
- Hell, maybe she's seen her.
- Ronnie.


767
01:12:07.221 --> 01:12:09.932
You can't see it
'cause you're too close to it.


768
01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:14.436
Anxiety spells you get,
you never had that shit back in school.


769
01:12:14.478 --> 01:12:16.647
- That's not true...
- You joined up in that monkey troop


770
01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:18.774
'cause you had a plan for yourself!

771
01:12:18.815 --> 01:12:21.652
Army's gonna pay for school.
Gonna get yourself a degree.


772
01:12:21.693 --> 01:12:23.570
Maybe something in business
or agriculture.


773
01:12:23.654 --> 01:12:25.239
You were gonna
make something of yourself.


774
01:12:25.322 --> 01:12:28.784
Then you had to go and fall in love
with the school slut.


775
01:12:28.825 --> 01:12:31.495
Hey, I know about how she was like.

776
01:12:32.162 --> 01:12:34.873
Hey, I was the only one
she talked to about it.


777
01:12:34.957 --> 01:12:36.667
How she was abused.

778
01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:40.379
- Terrible things, Gill.
- Bullshit.


779
01:12:40.462 --> 01:12:42.422
Terrible things. Things you
don't even wanna know about.


780
01:12:42.506 --> 01:12:44.007
You had a plan!

781
01:12:44.508 --> 01:12:47.344
You had a goddamn life
and she just fucked the guts out of you!


782
01:12:47.427 --> 01:12:49.888
She had to take care of me
the whole time!


783
01:12:51.515 --> 01:12:54.685
Shit, I'd start throwing up, choking!

784
01:12:57.354 --> 01:13:00.440
And I got better. You know?

785
01:13:02.025 --> 01:13:05.821
And since we been together
she put all that junk behind her.


786
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:08.699
She been faithful.

787
01:13:21.712 --> 01:13:23.422
First weekend away,

788
01:13:24.464 --> 01:13:27.384
when you was off playing soldier
on Saturdays,


789
01:13:27.467 --> 01:13:30.929
I come over, drop off spare keys
like you want me to.


790
01:13:31.763 --> 01:13:34.391
You weren't gone two hours

791
01:13:36.476 --> 01:13:39.354
and she was aching
to get me inside of her.


792
01:13:40.188 --> 01:13:43.900
I mean, every time you leave town,
that pussy's up for grabs.


793
01:13:43.942 --> 01:13:45.444
You're a liar.

794
01:13:47.571 --> 01:13:49.072
Is that right?

795
01:13:50.198 --> 01:13:54.119
Don't you think it's funny how I know
where everything in your house is?


796
01:13:57.539 --> 01:14:00.667
I don't care if that hurts you or not.
I really don't.


797
01:14:04.421 --> 01:14:05.630
Truth is

798
01:14:07.591 --> 01:14:10.260
I don't even know who you are anymore.

799
01:14:11.928 --> 01:14:14.806
So fuck it.

800
01:14:56.723 --> 01:14:59.810
- You gonna steal my truck now?
- Make yourself at home.


801
01:15:00.602 --> 01:15:02.437
You've done it already.

802
01:15:18.286 --> 01:15:20.872
- You take it straight?
- Sure.


803
01:15:32.426 --> 01:15:33.593
Jesus!

804
01:15:36.471 --> 01:15:38.640
- You want another one?
- Sure.


805
01:15:39.808 --> 01:15:41.810
We drinking buddies now?

806
01:15:45.439 --> 01:15:47.023
To

807
01:15:52.654 --> 01:15:53.864
freedom.

808
01:15:55.073 --> 01:15:56.825
Still making jokes.

809
01:16:00.662 --> 01:16:02.414
This ain't no joke.

810
01:16:04.082 --> 01:16:05.459
Come here.

811
01:16:11.798 --> 01:16:15.218
It ain't on me to change your life
or nobody else's.


812
01:16:17.345 --> 01:16:21.391
Shit. People gonna do
what the hell they wanna do anyway.


813
01:16:27.772 --> 01:16:29.900
You ain't got but one life.

814
01:16:30.984 --> 01:16:33.612
You ought to live
it the way you want.

815
01:16:44.748 --> 01:16:47.667
I can take you back to town now
if you want.


816
01:16:51.755 --> 01:16:52.797
Laz,

817
01:16:54.591 --> 01:16:56.760
will you do something for me?

818
01:17:00.514 --> 01:17:02.182
Whatever you want.

819
01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:37.842
I ain't played for nobody in years.

820
01:17:46.142 --> 01:17:49.521
I wanted me some kids,
a whole mess of them.


821
01:17:50.564 --> 01:17:54.985
But for Rose, my wife,
kids is for another time.


822
01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.825
Then one spring,

823
01:18:04.619 --> 01:18:06.663
I seened a change in her.

824
01:18:07.872 --> 01:18:10.041
Her breasts started swelling up.

825
01:18:10.959 --> 01:18:14.796
Couple of mornings,
I hear her in the bathroom throwing up.


826
01:18:14.838 --> 01:18:19.718
I done seen it in other women before,
so I knew.


827
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:25.265
Then one day,

828
01:18:26.266 --> 01:18:29.728
Rose said she had to go to Jackson,
visit her folks,


829
01:18:29.811 --> 01:18:33.523
and she ain't wanted me to go,
so I stayed here.


830
01:18:36.943 --> 01:18:40.780
You know how they talk about a woman
having that glow?


831
01:18:43.575 --> 01:18:45.702
She didn't have it no more.

832
01:18:48.163 --> 01:18:49.914
She done cut it out.

833
01:18:51.124 --> 01:18:52.667
Got rid of it.

834
01:18:58.632 --> 01:19:00.550
That voice in my head,

835
01:19:01.926 --> 01:19:05.722
every time I think it's gone,
it comes howling back.


836
01:19:08.642 --> 01:19:10.518
Calls me when I'm ailing,

837
01:19:11.227 --> 01:19:14.022
when I can't find my way home.

838
01:19:14.439 --> 01:19:16.358
Lost in the pines.

839
01:19:18.068 --> 01:19:20.737
I calls it the <i>Black Snake Moan.</i>

840
01:19:27.243 --> 01:19:31.289
<i>Black snake all in my room</i>

841
01:19:43.385 --> 01:19:47.055
<i>Black snake all in my room</i>

842
01:19:55.355 --> 01:19:58.274
<i>Some pretty mamma</i>

843
01:19:58.608 --> 01:20:02.779
<i>Better get this black snake soon</i>

844
01:20:11.079 --> 01:20:13.873
Sing, Laz. Please keep singing.

845
01:20:21.798 --> 01:20:24.300
<i>Black snake is evil</i>

846
01:20:25.593 --> 01:20:29.347
<i>Black snake is all I see</i>

847
01:20:36.980 --> 01:20:39.315
<i>Black snake is evil</i>

848
01:20:40.817 --> 01:20:44.320
<i>Black snake is all I see</i>

849
01:20:52.078 --> 01:20:54.122
<i>Woke up this morning</i>

850
01:20:56.416 --> 01:21:00.003
<i>Black snake moved in on me</i>

851
01:21:44.506 --> 01:21:47.383
- Where you gonna be?
- I'm gonna be right here.


852
01:21:47.425 --> 01:21:49.260
- Be here all afternoon.
- Okay.


853
01:21:53.973 --> 01:21:55.058
Hey.

854
01:21:56.601 --> 01:21:58.770
You sure you ready for this?

855
01:22:00.563 --> 01:22:03.858
Yeah. Yeah, no big deal.
I'm just gonna get some girlie stuff.


856
01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.236
You know, like some makeup and stuff.

857
01:22:07.737 --> 01:22:09.072
All right.

858
01:22:23.211 --> 01:22:24.295
Hey.

859
01:22:25.004 --> 01:22:27.507
You know,
this town ain't going nowhere.


860
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:29.717
Take all the time you need.

861
01:22:30.218 --> 01:22:31.594
All right.

862
01:22:53.157 --> 01:22:54.951
She a friend of mine.

863
01:23:12.886 --> 01:23:15.972
I bet you got
a lot of loyal customers.

864
01:23:16.014 --> 01:23:17.974
- Hey, Miss Angie.
- Hey.


865
01:23:18.975 --> 01:23:20.685
Like what I brung you, huh?

866
01:23:20.768 --> 01:23:23.354
I've been eating like a princess all week.

867
01:23:24.522 --> 01:23:27.025
I even got enough
for us to take lunch.

868
01:23:27.108 --> 01:23:28.484
That'd be nice.

869
01:23:28.526 --> 01:23:31.571
And I got that
lotion on you gave me.

870
01:23:33.281 --> 01:23:34.991
Can you smell it?

871
01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.830
Now that's nice, too.

872
01:24:00.934 --> 01:24:02.018
Hey.

873
01:24:03.978 --> 01:24:05.939
What happened to your face?

874
01:24:06.606 --> 01:24:08.691
I got in a little accident.

875
01:24:11.736 --> 01:24:14.405
I was thinking,
since you're working on the square now,


876
01:24:14.489 --> 01:24:18.493
if you wanted to, we could get coffee
or something some morning.


877
01:24:18.534 --> 01:24:21.371
- You need money again?
- No.


878
01:24:21.454 --> 01:24:22.705
No, I...

879
01:24:24.123 --> 01:24:25.959
Why we always gotta do this?

880
01:24:26.042 --> 01:24:28.836
You and me been at each other
as far back as I can remember.


881
01:24:28.878 --> 01:24:30.380
I'm your daughter.

882
01:24:31.422 --> 01:24:35.593
- I'm the only family you got.
- You never needed nobody, Rae.


883
01:24:35.677 --> 01:24:37.762
You always made that
perfectly clear to me.


884
01:24:37.845 --> 01:24:39.305
I know I did.

885
01:24:40.723 --> 01:24:44.894
But I'm trying to be different, you know.
I'm trying to get some peace.


886
01:24:46.396 --> 01:24:49.732
Yeah, well, I'm working here now.
Can't you see that?


887
01:24:53.695 --> 01:24:55.738
I just wanted some makeup.

888
01:24:55.822 --> 01:24:57.865
All that shit's on aisle five.

889
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:08.876
I just think you should've
kept him off me, that's all.


890
01:25:16.050 --> 01:25:19.762
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Now don't do that, Mamma.


891
01:25:19.846 --> 01:25:22.473
I will go along
with all the crap you talk about me,


892
01:25:22.557 --> 01:25:24.767
but you can't pretend no more on that.

893
01:25:24.851 --> 01:25:26.394
'Cause I was just a kid.

894
01:25:26.436 --> 01:25:28.855
I didn't know
about all that shit he was doing to me.


895
01:25:28.938 --> 01:25:30.898
And you let him do it.

896
01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:34.235
Some big nobody in your life and you
let him do whatever the fuck he wanted!


897
01:25:34.277 --> 01:25:37.572
No. Okay. All right. I'm sorry, Mamma.
I didn't mean to shout.


898
01:25:37.613 --> 01:25:39.157
Sorry, I didn't mean to get upset.
I just...


899
01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:41.075
All my life I've been
putting out your fires


900
01:25:41.117 --> 01:25:43.995
while you been giving out your snatch
to every wagging dick in this town!


901
01:25:44.078 --> 01:25:45.288
And now you're gonna
put the blame at my feet?


902
01:25:45.329 --> 01:25:46.497
Mamma, if we can just talk about it.

903
01:25:46.581 --> 01:25:48.249
If you could just tell me,
we could be eye to eye on this.


904
01:25:48.291 --> 01:25:49.500
I'm just not gonna take your shit.
No, I'm not.


905
01:25:49.584 --> 01:25:52.795
You don't have to say you're sorry!
Just tell me how you knew!


906
01:25:52.879 --> 01:25:55.006
The only thing I'm sorry for

907
01:25:55.089 --> 01:25:57.508
is for ever listening to my parents
and having you


908
01:25:57.592 --> 01:25:59.761
and not doing what I should've done.

909
01:26:10.146 --> 01:26:13.983
Tell me you didn't know,
you goddamn liar! Tell me!


910
01:26:14.692 --> 01:26:17.403
You fucking liar!

911
01:26:17.487 --> 01:26:18.988
Fuck you!

912
01:26:19.072 --> 01:26:22.742
You were in the next goddamn room,
you bitch!


913
01:26:24.452 --> 01:26:27.497
What you be doing with yourself
when you ain't working?


914
01:26:28.581 --> 01:26:31.501
I was thinking about singing in the choir.

915
01:26:31.584 --> 01:26:33.044
Up at the church?

916
01:26:33.127 --> 01:26:36.255
- Why don't you sing me something?
- When? Now?


917
01:26:36.339 --> 01:26:37.507
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.


918
01:26:37.548 --> 01:26:41.761
Come on now, don't be shy.
Just go ahead and let it out.


919
01:26:45.264 --> 01:26:46.974
All right. Let's see.

920
01:26:49.393 --> 01:26:55.691
<i>There is a balm in Gilead</i>

921
01:26:57.318 --> 01:27:02.615
<i>To make the wounded whole</i>

922
01:27:03.783 --> 01:27:10.289
<i>There is a balm in Gilead</i>

923
01:27:11.207 --> 01:27:16.420
<i>To heal the sin sick soul</i>

924
01:27:17.338 --> 01:27:19.590
What? What is it?

925
01:27:21.592 --> 01:27:22.969
Get off!

926
01:27:24.387 --> 01:27:25.847
My God!

927
01:27:28.057 --> 01:27:30.893
Turn her loose!
Turn her loose, God damn it!


928
01:27:36.566 --> 01:27:38.734
Do you hear the sound of my voice?

929
01:27:43.573 --> 01:27:46.075
Y'all get on out the way now.
Move, man!


930
01:27:50.830 --> 01:27:52.248
This your niece?

931
01:28:23.946 --> 01:28:26.782
You took care of your wife
like you do me?


932
01:28:29.452 --> 01:28:30.661
I tried.

933
01:29:27.677 --> 01:29:30.096
Ain't no use in us fighting this shit.

934
01:29:30.179 --> 01:29:32.390
You and me, we night owls.

935
01:29:33.516 --> 01:29:34.809
Get dressed.

936
01:29:52.201 --> 01:29:54.912
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.


937
01:30:02.795 --> 01:30:04.964
All right, see if you can find yourself
a seat over there


938
01:30:05.047 --> 01:30:07.049
in the corner on that bench.

939
01:30:07.091 --> 01:30:09.593
Go on.
Ain't nobody gonna fuck with you.


940
01:30:10.469 --> 01:30:11.887
Who the hell's all this?

941
01:30:11.971 --> 01:30:15.266
What? I called Bojo, like you said.
Called the fellas in the band.


942
01:30:15.349 --> 01:30:17.059
Where the fuck
all these people come from?


943
01:30:17.101 --> 01:30:18.853
I been drinking
in this shithole all my life,


944
01:30:18.894 --> 01:30:21.022
I ain't never seen
this many people in here at once.


945
01:30:21.063 --> 01:30:22.982
Shithole? Kiss my ass, Laz.

946
01:30:23.065 --> 01:30:24.483
Back at you, motherfucker.

947
01:30:24.567 --> 01:30:27.862
I bet both of y'all called all these people,
didn't you?


948
01:30:27.903 --> 01:30:31.365
That's right, preacher, get me drunk
so I don't stick my foot up your ass.


949
01:30:31.407 --> 01:30:33.409
I just know how you get.

950
01:30:33.451 --> 01:30:36.579
Good to know
you still got some butterflies in your gut.


951
01:30:37.705 --> 01:30:39.540
All right, here we go.

952
01:30:40.374 --> 01:30:41.751
Hey, y'all.

953
01:30:42.585 --> 01:30:43.669
All right.

954
01:30:52.219 --> 01:30:55.765
Ced. Ken. Thank y'all for coming.

955
01:30:57.433 --> 01:31:00.019
All y'all, hush up. Shut up.

956
01:31:01.187 --> 01:31:04.440
All right now.
Y'all ready for some shit?


957
01:31:05.649 --> 01:31:07.735
Is you ready for some shit?

958
01:31:09.653 --> 01:31:11.072
<i>Alice Mae.</i>

959
01:31:20.539 --> 01:31:23.417
<i>If you see my baby</i>

960
01:31:23.459 --> 01:31:26.712
<i>They call her Alice Mae</i>

961
01:31:26.796 --> 01:31:28.964
Yeah! You home now, old man!

962
01:31:29.006 --> 01:31:31.342
You just walked through the door!
Yeah!


963
01:31:31.425 --> 01:31:34.011
<i>If you see my baby</i>

964
01:31:34.095 --> 01:31:37.681
<i>They call her Alice Mae</i>

965
01:31:37.765 --> 01:31:39.642
You wanna cut it up, baby?

966
01:31:42.478 --> 01:31:45.147
<i>Tell all them fellas</i>

967
01:31:45.231 --> 01:31:48.192
<i>They'd better stay away</i>

968
01:31:52.571 --> 01:31:55.241
<i>Tell all them fellas</i>

969
01:31:55.324 --> 01:31:58.494
<i>In this here neighborhood</i>

970
01:32:03.165 --> 01:32:05.668
<i>Tell all them fellas</i>

971
01:32:05.751 --> 01:32:09.004
<i>In this here neighborhood</i>

972
01:32:14.176 --> 01:32:16.345
<i>This here's my woman</i>

973
01:32:16.387 --> 01:32:21.559
<i>That chacha will do you no good</i>

974
01:32:30.484 --> 01:32:32.862
Whoa! Yeah!

975
01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:48.752
<i>This here a song
from back in the day</i>


976
01:32:48.836 --> 01:32:51.839
<i>Nineteen hundred and sixty-two</i>

977
01:32:53.466 --> 01:32:57.011
<i>My woman put my black ass
out in the cold</i>


978
01:32:57.052 --> 01:32:59.138
<i>I said, "Baby, why you leaving?"</i>

979
01:32:59.221 --> 01:33:01.557
<i>She said, "Our love done gone cold"</i>

980
01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:05.853
<i>Well, I waded through water
and I waded through mud</i>


981
01:33:05.895 --> 01:33:10.357
<i>Till I come to this place
they call the Bucket of Blood</i>


982
01:33:20.075 --> 01:33:23.245
<i>You know, that bartender
give me a dirty look and a dirty glass</i>


983
01:33:23.329 --> 01:33:27.625
<i>I said, "Say, motherfucker!
Do you know who I am?"</i>


984
01:33:27.708 --> 01:33:32.087
<i>He said, "Hell no, nigger!
I don't give a goddamn!"</i>


985
01:33:41.805 --> 01:33:45.643
<i>I reached down in my pocket
and pulled out my shiny.44</i>


986
01:33:45.726 --> 01:33:47.811
<i>Shot that motherfucker twice!</i>

987
01:33:47.895 --> 01:33:49.563
<i>He hit the goddamn floor</i>

988
01:33:54.610 --> 01:33:58.322
<i>'Bout that time
you could've heard the drop of a pin</i>


989
01:33:58.405 --> 01:34:02.785
<i>That's when that bad motherfucker
Billy Lyons walked in</i>


990
01:34:11.961 --> 01:34:16.173
<i>'Bout that time a pimp eased up
and turned out the lights</i>


991
01:34:16.257 --> 01:34:20.010
<i>That's when I had old Billy Lyons
dead in my sights</i>


992
01:34:20.094 --> 01:34:23.764
<i>When the lights come back on
old Billy gone to rest</i>


993
01:34:23.806 --> 01:34:28.102
<i>I pumped nine of my bullets
in his motherfucking chest!</i>


994
01:35:06.682 --> 01:35:09.393
<i>Sometime, that kind of blues</i>

995
01:35:10.102 --> 01:35:13.981
<i>will make you even kill one another</i>

996
01:35:14.023 --> 01:35:17.610
<i>or do anything that kind of low.</i>

997
01:35:18.235 --> 01:35:21.530
<i>It goes here, on this side.</i>

998
01:35:23.115 --> 01:35:24.908
<i>That's where the blues started.</i>

999
01:35:24.992 --> 01:35:27.286
<i>It ain't on this side. 
It's over here.</i>

1000
01:35:32.541 --> 01:35:35.210
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1001
01:35:35.294 --> 01:35:38.589
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1002
01:35:38.672 --> 01:35:41.592
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1003
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:47.014
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1004
01:35:50.893 --> 01:35:54.021
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1005
01:35:54.063 --> 01:35:57.149
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1006
01:35:57.232 --> 01:35:59.610
<i>This little light of...</i>

1007
01:36:00.861 --> 01:36:02.363
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1008
01:36:02.404 --> 01:36:04.531
Look like somebody know a song.

1009
01:36:06.033 --> 01:36:09.578
No. I got the words in my head
but, you know...


1010
01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:12.581
I don't know where I learned it.
But I can't play.


1011
01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:15.125
How you feeling?

1012
01:36:16.585 --> 01:36:19.588
You know how you feel
when you come out of a bad hangover?


1013
01:36:19.630 --> 01:36:22.424
You know, like you could
open your eyes a little more?


1014
01:36:22.466 --> 01:36:24.635
Yeah. Yeah, I'm there.

1015
01:36:25.803 --> 01:36:29.139
I got up real early this morning.
You know, the sun was shining.


1016
01:36:29.223 --> 01:36:32.059
And I thought
maybe I'd see if I could play this, but...


1017
01:36:32.101 --> 01:36:34.103
- You can.
- No, I can't.


1018
01:36:34.186 --> 01:36:36.689
Yeah, you can.
Right here. Right here, see?


1019
01:36:39.274 --> 01:36:42.611
- I tell you what. You sing.
- All right.


1020
01:36:42.695 --> 01:36:45.614
- I'll see if I can pick it out for you.
- Okay.


1021
01:36:47.616 --> 01:36:49.118
All right, now.

1022
01:36:49.702 --> 01:36:55.207
Just close your eyes
and think on what you love.


1023
01:36:56.959 --> 01:36:59.795
- Get a real good picture of it.
- What I love.


1024

01:38:20.793 --> 01:38:21.877
No!

1047
01:38:24.046 --> 01:38:28.050
It ain't been but a week
and you already some nigger's whore.


1048
01:38:29.593 --> 01:38:32.054
Oh, did you think I wouldn't find out?

1049
01:38:33.388 --> 01:38:35.724
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

1050
01:38:35.808 --> 01:38:40.270
Gill told me how you and him...
How you and everybody...


1051
01:38:40.354 --> 01:38:42.523
Did you have fun with her, huh?

1052
01:38:43.232 --> 01:38:46.026
Sweet as a peach, I bet! Huh?

1053
01:38:46.068 --> 01:38:48.403
- No!
- Shut up, bitch! Shut the fuck up!


1054
01:38:48.445 --> 01:38:51.156
Be careful where you aim that gun, boy.

1055
01:38:52.491 --> 01:38:54.952
Or what? Huh?

1056
01:38:55.786 --> 01:38:57.246
Or what?

1057
01:38:57.287 --> 01:38:59.581
You come to talk, boy,
or you come to kill somebody?


1058
01:38:59.665 --> 01:39:02.459
You ain't gonna be calling me boy
when I blow your fucking face off!


1059
01:39:02.543 --> 01:39:06.964
Boy, you so green
you couldn't stomp a baby duck.


1060
01:39:07.798 --> 01:39:09.925
Are you testing me? Huh?

1061
01:39:09.967 --> 01:39:12.427
Just what kind of test
would that be, huh?


1062
01:39:13.428 --> 01:39:15.097
Test if you're a man?

1063
01:39:15.931 --> 01:39:17.683
If you're a killer?

1064
01:39:18.517 --> 01:39:21.061
Hell, that ain't hard
to find out, is it?

1065
01:39:21.103 --> 01:39:23.313
All you gotta do
is pull that trigger back.

1066
01:39:24.481 --> 01:39:25.649
Go on.

1067
01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:27.693
Go ahead.

1068
01:39:30.946 --> 01:39:33.115
- Okay, Ronnie...
- God damn it, Rae!


1069
01:39:33.156 --> 01:39:35.617
Keep that gun trained on me, boy.

1070
01:39:35.659 --> 01:39:39.037
Now, you wanna kill a man,
and all you need's a reason, right?


1071
01:39:39.121 --> 01:39:41.540
Well, you know
she been out here with me.


1072
01:39:42.958 --> 01:39:46.962
Been all over town giving up that switch
you thought was yours.


1073
01:39:47.045 --> 01:39:50.299
- Shut up!
- Give all your love to one woman


1074
01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:52.759
and she give it to another man.

1075
01:39:52.801 --> 01:39:55.470
Now that's a reason
to kill a man there.

1076
01:39:55.554 --> 01:39:59.308
Then won't be no questions.
She'll know you a man!


1077
01:39:59.391 --> 01:40:01.560
- A real killer!
- Don't say that to me!


1078
01:40:01.643 --> 01:40:04.354
I'm too old to play house or cowboys.

1079
01:40:05.981 --> 01:40:08.984
You gonna do it or
get out of my face.

1080
01:40:11.445 --> 01:40:12.613
Go on.

1081
01:40:13.447 --> 01:40:14.656
Do it!

1082
01:40:15.782 --> 01:40:17.576
Ronnie. Ronnie.

1083
01:40:19.286 --> 01:40:23.165
Ronnie, baby, look at me.
Ronnie, look at me. Look at me.


1084
01:40:23.206 --> 01:40:24.833
Come on, look at me.

1085
01:40:24.875 --> 01:40:29.004
Baby, it's all right. I
got you. I got you.

1086
01:40:29.087 --> 01:40:32.049
Come on. Come on.

1087
01:40:36.345 --> 01:40:39.014
Hold on. Hold on, baby.

1088
01:40:41.016 --> 01:40:42.726
- Hey, it's me.
- It's okay.


1089
01:40:42.809 --> 01:40:44.978
I need you to get over here.

1090
01:40:45.687 --> 01:40:47.272
Yeah, right now!

1091
01:40:57.866 --> 01:41:00.535
We did a lot
of dreaming, me and Rae.

1092
01:41:02.871 --> 01:41:04.873
Made big plans to get out.

1093
01:41:10.087 --> 01:41:14.132
I'd go do my tour
and move out of here.

1094
01:41:17.052 --> 01:41:18.887
Maybe go to Knoxville.

1095
01:41:28.397 --> 01:41:29.815
But when Rae

1096
01:41:30.649 --> 01:41:32.776
gets like she does

1097
01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:37.072
and does the things

1098
01:41:38.949 --> 01:41:40.575
that she does...

1099
01:41:45.455 --> 01:41:47.499
Go on, Ronnie. Go on.

1100
01:41:47.582 --> 01:41:51.420
- This is fucking stupid.
- Go on.


1101
01:41:53.088 --> 01:41:55.882
What Rae did for me,

1102
01:42:00.178 --> 01:42:01.680
she fixed me.

1103
01:42:08.437 --> 01:42:10.230
But I can't fix her.

1104
01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:15.944
Rae,

1105
01:42:17.487 --> 01:42:20.615
we don't wanna fix you or judge you.

1106
01:42:21.825 --> 01:42:24.202
Only you and the
good Lord can do that.

1107
01:42:25.245 --> 01:42:28.457
But I want you to tell me
about these spells you get.


1108
01:42:33.128 --> 01:42:34.337
Well,

1109
01:42:36.673 --> 01:42:39.301
I get these thoughts in my head,
you know.


1110
01:42:41.303 --> 01:42:45.348
Like shit I done
or shit that's been done to me,


1111
01:42:45.432 --> 01:42:48.101
and I can't get them out.

1112
01:42:48.643 --> 01:42:51.521
And it burns, you know, it hurts.

1113
01:42:51.605 --> 01:42:55.484
It starts in my head
and moves down to my hands,


1114
01:42:55.567 --> 01:42:59.780
and my stomach, and then lower, and...

1115
01:43:01.823 --> 01:43:07.287
You know, sometimes I can stop them
but mostly I can't.


1116
01:43:08.246 --> 01:43:10.499
The only thing that ever
made that feel better was Ronnie


1117
01:43:10.582 --> 01:43:12.292
'cause I love him so much.

1118
01:43:14.086 --> 01:43:18.215
Why don't you look at Ronnie
and tell him how you feel?


1119
01:43:33.939 --> 01:43:36.650
I think... I think we're fucked up.

1120
01:43:37.901 --> 01:43:40.487
Both of us. I
mean, I know I am.

1121
01:43:42.864 --> 01:43:46.701
But that don't mean
that what I feel isn't real,


1122
01:43:47.202 --> 01:43:49.287
that I can't love somebody.

1123
01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:57.337
And I know how I've been
and what I've done is real, real bad.


1124
01:43:58.380 --> 01:43:59.589
But...

1125
01:44:08.890 --> 01:44:11.601
So if you wanna quit on me,
I understand.


1126
01:44:13.228 --> 01:44:14.771
But please don't.

1127
01:44:19.067 --> 01:44:20.235
So,

1128
01:44:22.154 --> 01:44:24.573
what you two gonna do about this?

1129
01:44:40.589 --> 01:44:42.215
Hi, Miss Angie.

1130
01:44:42.257 --> 01:44:46.803
You wasn't at your work
so I just figured I'd drop by.


1131
01:44:46.887 --> 01:44:48.388
What you need?

1132
01:44:49.639 --> 01:44:51.558
I need your help again.

1133
01:44:52.350 --> 01:44:53.935
More cough syrup?

1134
01:44:56.021 --> 01:44:57.272
Come on.

1135
01:45:02.277 --> 01:45:03.486
Shit.

1136
01:45:05.697 --> 01:45:07.115
You Ronnie?

1137
01:45:08.992 --> 01:45:10.076
Yeah.

1138
01:45:10.118 --> 01:45:12.871
I'm Lincoln.
I'm gonna be your best man.


1139
01:45:13.955 --> 01:45:15.081
Okay.

1140
01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:19.002
You having trouble with that tie?
'Cause I'm pretty good at it.


1141
01:45:25.759 --> 01:45:28.970
Gotta do it like this
or I'll get all turned around.


1142
01:45:34.142 --> 01:45:36.978
Laz, she's ready.

1143
01:45:42.817 --> 01:45:44.444
Ain't she pretty?

1144
01:45:44.945 --> 01:45:47.364
I'll give y'all some time together.

1145
01:45:53.995 --> 01:45:55.830
Now that is sharp!

1146
01:45:56.456 --> 01:45:59.000
Girl, you sharp as a tack.

1147
01:45:59.042 --> 01:46:01.169
Old Miss Ella Mae done you right,
didn't she?


1148
01:46:01.211 --> 01:46:02.921
- Yeah.
- You like it?


1149
01:46:03.004 --> 01:46:04.506
I've had nice things before

1150
01:46:04.547 --> 01:46:06.841
but, you know,
I always seem to ruin them somehow.


1151
01:46:06.883 --> 01:46:10.470
This here one yours.
I know you gonna take care of it.


1152
01:46:10.512 --> 01:46:14.015
- I'm gonna try. But, Laz...
- Hey, hey.


1153
01:46:14.099 --> 01:46:17.727
We ain't gonna have
no talk like that today, all right?


1154
01:46:17.811 --> 01:46:21.690
You and me, we gonna get through this.
We gonna be just fine.


1155
01:46:23.024 --> 01:46:25.527
You go on and live your life.

1156
01:46:25.610 --> 01:46:29.322
Get your shit together and live your life.

1157
01:46:30.365 --> 01:46:31.449
Okay.

1158
01:46:37.372 --> 01:46:39.833
I don't want you
to let go of me.

1159
01:46:41.001 --> 01:46:42.377
You and me,

1160
01:46:43.837 --> 01:46:46.256
we always gonna have hope
to each other.


1161
01:46:53.471 --> 01:46:57.976
<i>When I was a child,
I talked like a child,</i>


1162
01:46:58.059 --> 01:47:02.731
<i>I thought like a child,
I reasoned like a child.</i>


1163
01:47:03.732 --> 01:47:08.570
<i>When I became a man,
I put aside my childish ways.</i>


1164
01:47:09.696 --> 01:47:12.407
All right. You got her now.

1165
01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:16.369
<i>And now these three remain,</i>

1166
01:47:17.746 --> 01:47:22.792
<i>faith, hope and love.</i>

1167
01:47:23.293 --> 01:47:26.379
<i>But the greatest of these is love.</i>

1168
01:48:50.296 --> 01:48:51.506
Ronnie?

1169
01:48:53.174 --> 01:48:54.509
I gotta pull over.

1170
01:49:35.425 --> 01:49:36.551
Okay.

1171
01:49:37.969 --> 01:49:39.053
Okay.

1172
01:49:40.263 --> 01:49:41.389
Okay.

1173
01:49:43.224 --> 01:49:45.643
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1174
01:49:45.727 --> 01:49:48.646
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1175
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:51.232
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1176
01:49:51.316 --> 01:49:53.568
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1177
01:49:53.651 --> 01:49:56.446
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1178
01:49:56.529 --> 01:49:59.616
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1179
01:49:59.699 --> 01:50:04.078
<i>Let it shine, let
it shine, let it shine</i>

1180
01:50:08.541 --> 01:50:09.876
Baby.

1181
01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:13.004
See?

1182
01:50:13.713 --> 01:50:15.340
See? We're okay.

1183
01:50:15.965 --> 01:50:17.342
We're okay.
