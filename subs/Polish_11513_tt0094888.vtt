1
00:00:01.445 --> 00:00:03.903
That will cost you money.

2
00:00:04.903 --> 00:00:07.861
Ladies and gentlemen...

3
00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:12.528
...you'll have to pay up...

4
00:00:12.652 --> 00:00:17.444
... if you want me to sing the
ballad of Francisco Manoel...


5
00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:22.153
...the bandit of Cobra Verde...

6
00:00:22.278 --> 00:00:25.320
...the poorest of the poor...

7
00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:29.278
...the master of the slaves...

8
00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:36.027
It was he who became the Viceroy.

9
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:40.820
It was he who was the
Alonest of the alone.


10
00:00:47.694 --> 00:00:49.611
Francisco Manoel's mother sighs,

11
00:00:49.736 --> 00:00:52.070
Francisco, I feel only
aches and dread.


12
00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:54.070
Francisco Manoel's mother cries

13
00:00:54.195 --> 00:00:56.653
Francisco, leave me.
I will soon be dead.


14
00:00:57.903 --> 00:01:01.736
Eleven years of drought,
the rocks are sick.


15
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:05.736
The world is dying.
Evil is a trick.


16
00:01:20.403 --> 00:01:24.361
I will die now. Be quiet, or the
bench will crack from sadness.


17
00:01:24.445 --> 00:01:25.986
Do not move. Stay still.

18
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.820
The water, the earth
and the sun turn black.


19
00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:31.861
God in His Perplexity,
pretends it's His Will.


20
00:01:33.362 --> 00:01:36.112
Francisco, traveling,
reads a line in the sky.


21
00:01:36.236 --> 00:01:38.569
''Don't set your eyes
on the salt sea shore.


22
00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:41.111
Don't reason. Don't argue.
Don't ask us why.


23
00:01:41.236 --> 00:01:44.027
Fate will send you a lover,
and one friend more.''


24
00:02:50.362 --> 00:02:55.237
Based on the novel '' The Viceroy
of Ouidah'' by Bruce Chatwin


25
00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:09.444
His Royal Highness
Nana Agyefi Kwamell of Nsein


26
00:03:16.278 --> 00:03:20.195
and with the girls of the
Zigi Cultural Troupe Ho Ziavi


27
00:05:37.528 --> 00:05:39.154
Where's my money?!

28
00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:45.986
Where's my money?! Where are my
partners?! Where's my money?!


29
00:05:51.444 --> 00:05:54.986
Keep moving! Next?

30
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.861
What the hell are you doing here?
There's no money for you!


31
00:05:57.945 --> 00:05:59.236
What? No! I can't believe it!

32
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.153
You know you don't get
any wages this week.


33
00:06:01.236 --> 00:06:04.778
The bank kept it all! Get out!

34
00:06:05.903 --> 00:06:07.694
There's no place here
for blood suckers.


35
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.112
You bastard! You cheated me!

36
00:06:15.486 --> 00:06:17.987
I want you awake when you die!

37
00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:41.194
It's Cobra Verde, the bandit!
Get the children in a safe place!


38
00:06:55.945 --> 00:06:58.112
Go on, get it into the church!

39
00:08:41.611 --> 00:08:44.277
That rifle stays outside!

40
00:08:45.319 --> 00:08:49.152
Now, get that thing out of here,
or I'll throw you out!


41
00:09:01.028 --> 00:09:07.069
I want something to eat! Tell
your parents Cobra Verde is here!


42
00:09:07.194 --> 00:09:13.361
I have no parents! This is my bar,
and you don't frighten me!


43
00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:24.653
My name is Francisco Manoel.

44
00:09:25.403 --> 00:09:28.528
And my name is Euclides...

45
00:09:28.653 --> 00:09:34.820
Euclides Alves da Silva
Pernambucano Wandereley.


46
00:09:36.444 --> 00:09:38.694
I'm a da Silva too.

47
00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:44.528
It's only my chest and shoulders
that are crooked - at night...


48
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:48.277
I always dream I have to carry a
whole mountain range on my back.


49
00:09:50.611 --> 00:09:53.985
You stand straighter than
the whole town!


50
00:09:54.986 --> 00:09:59.445
- I'm hungry.
- I'll bring you some food.


51
00:10:22.653 --> 00:10:25.027
How do you know all these things?

52
00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:30.027
From our priest, and he
learned them from our Bishop.


53
00:10:31.236 --> 00:10:33.611
And where does
the snow come from?


54
00:10:34.027 --> 00:10:36.319
You'll see it out there!

55
00:10:36.403 --> 00:10:39.570
There's always snow on the moon!

56
00:10:39.695 --> 00:10:42.612
That's why it's always white!
White and cold.


57
00:10:42.736 --> 00:10:45.361
You have to look very carefully.

58
00:10:46.278 --> 00:10:47.695
Why is that?

59
00:10:48.194 --> 00:10:53.528
It's because the moon...
takes the water out of the ocean.


60
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:54.985
And when night falls...

61
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:58.528
the tips of the mountains
attract the snowflakes.


62
00:10:58.611 --> 00:11:03.236
But only as much salt
as we have in our tears.


63
00:11:05.903 --> 00:11:06.985
And here on earth?

64
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:11.403
It's very far away -
you must keep going west.


65
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:15.862
Four years in horseback...
and ten on foot.


66
00:11:15.944 --> 00:11:19.361
And after that,
there are high mountains.


67
00:11:19.486 --> 00:11:23.486
They rise higher and higher -
right over the clouds.


68
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:27.028
And then above the clouds,
then you find the snow.


69
00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:29.653
It only falls in the night-time.

70
00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:36.570
Just like feathers. But it only falls...
from above the clouds.


71
00:11:36.944 --> 00:11:41.445
And then the whole world
turns light as feather -


72
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.194
and snow white!

73
00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.487
Even the lions turn white...
and the eagles...


74
00:11:51.653 --> 00:11:53.861
the rabbits get a snowy coat...

75
00:11:53.986 --> 00:11:57.403
and all the animals
in the world turn white!


76
00:11:59.361 --> 00:12:02.194
And when you're walking
through the snow...


77
00:12:02.319 --> 00:12:06.402
your feet don't weigh anything at all.

78
00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:11.779
And the little snowflakes,
go flying up in the air...


79
00:12:12.528 --> 00:12:14.528
just like feathers.

80
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:30.861
In a year or so,
I'm going to sell this bar.


81
00:12:30.944 --> 00:12:35.027
And then go west,
and climb up the mountains.


82
00:12:38.986 --> 00:12:41.445
I'm going east to the sea.

83
00:12:42.028 --> 00:12:46.111
The Sertao dries our hearts,
and kills the cattle.


84
00:12:47.236 --> 00:12:50.403
You'd better be very careful
when you go to the sea...


85
00:12:50.528 --> 00:12:52.861
it's where the tempests are born...

86
00:12:52.944 --> 00:12:55.069
and the snowflakes
have their cradle.


87
00:12:55.194 --> 00:12:58.528
That's what the reverend father said!

88
00:13:20.737 --> 00:13:23.487
I never had a
friend in all my life...

89
00:13:26.445 --> 00:13:27.612
Farewell.

90
00:14:26.236 --> 00:14:27.819
Your money or your life!

91
00:14:33.361 --> 00:14:34.819
My life.

92
00:15:52.111 --> 00:15:57.194
Every day... you walk forty miles
through the thorns...


93
00:15:57.778 --> 00:16:02.028
And why are you barefoot?
Don't you have any shoes?


94
00:16:04.195 --> 00:16:06.070
I don't trust shoes.

95
00:16:06.195 --> 00:16:09.153
And why don't you have a horse?

96
00:16:10.903 --> 00:16:15.529
I'd never trust a horse.
And I don't trust people either.


97
00:16:16.861 --> 00:16:20.694
But I long to go forth
from here to another world.


98
00:17:22.527 --> 00:17:25.194
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

99
00:17:35.153 --> 00:17:39.153
Don't run away.
It'll only be worse for you.


100
00:17:42.527 --> 00:17:44.111
Let him go!

101
00:17:45.736 --> 00:17:48.527
He can find the post by himself!

102
00:18:28.527 --> 00:18:33.111
Hey, you with the bare feet.
What's your name?


103
00:18:36.111 --> 00:18:40.861
Da Silva...
Francisco Manoel da Silva.


104
00:18:41.195 --> 00:18:46.736
I am Colonel Octavio Cotinho.
I need a man like you.


105
00:18:46.861 --> 00:18:49.694
I have six hundred slaves
in my sugar fields...


106
00:18:49.778 --> 00:18:52.237
and my overseer is an idiot.

107
00:18:54.403 --> 00:18:57.444
No one... grows more sugar than I do.

108
00:19:37.903 --> 00:19:40.611
Now, if that's not enough,
you can always ask for more.


109
00:19:40.694 --> 00:19:42.694
I've never had
this many clothes before.


110
00:19:42.819 --> 00:19:46.569
You know, when I think there
are still some fields not planted...


111
00:19:46.694 --> 00:19:48.694
with my sugar cane.

112
00:19:49.153 --> 00:19:52.819
It makes me even madder
to think there are meadows...


113
00:19:53.945 --> 00:19:56.320
where my cattle aren't grazing!

114
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:03.486
And when I think of
all the mulatto girls...


115
00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:06.819
I haven't made pregnant yet, why,
that's quite beyond endurance.


116
00:20:06.903 --> 00:20:10.070
Better watch out for the ladies,
my friend!


117
00:20:10.903 --> 00:20:12.694
And when do I start work?

118
00:20:12.819 --> 00:20:16.527
Oh, there's no hurry.
I'll show you everything.


119
00:20:43.528 --> 00:20:45.320
You'll be the overseer here.

120
00:20:45.402 --> 00:20:48.402
We harvest twice a year,
it's that fertile.


121
00:20:48.528 --> 00:20:51.403
I've got another forty sugar
plantations just like this one.


122
00:20:52.611 --> 00:20:56.611
I alone produce more sugar than
the whole state of Pernambuco.


123
00:20:56.694 --> 00:20:59.944
A hundred thousand tons per year.

124
00:21:00.237 --> 00:21:03.361
And all of it goes to England,
our enemy.


125
00:21:03.486 --> 00:21:07.861
They've abolished the slave trade.
They seize our ships.


126
00:21:07.945 --> 00:21:10.403
And yet, without us they
wouldn't have any sugar.


127
00:21:10.528 --> 00:21:12.237
And the way they buy the sugar...

128
00:21:12.361 --> 00:21:14.862
you'd think our rivers were
overflowing with the stuff.


129
00:21:14.945 --> 00:21:16.403
Hah, it's grotesque.

130
00:21:17.195 --> 00:21:19.569
You'll be in charge here, too.

131
00:21:20.569 --> 00:21:22.402
This is where we squeeze
out the sugar cane...


132
00:21:22.528 --> 00:21:24.279
and this is where
the juice is thickened.


133
00:21:24.361 --> 00:21:27.153
We heat the molasses up to
a hundred and twenty degrees.


134
00:21:27.237 --> 00:21:29.820
At this stage it's still a thin syrup.

135
00:21:29.903 --> 00:21:34.444
In a couple of hours the
molasses will start to crystallize.


136
00:21:35.611 --> 00:21:38.736
This is no easy task - every now
and then one of the workers...


137
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:40.277
collapses from the fumes.

138
00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:42.070
But we've got enough of them.

139
00:21:42.195 --> 00:21:45.861
As you see here we're ladling it
from one tub to another.


140
00:22:28.195 --> 00:22:30.528
Don't run away.
Get a machete. Hurry!


141
00:22:37.153 --> 00:22:40.235
We're going to have to
hack another arm off!


142
00:22:41.028 --> 00:22:42.486
Is there nothing we can do?

143
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:44.903
Oh, this sort of thing
happens all the time.


144
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:10.361
How very strange. I haven't bred
any children yet today.


145
00:23:10.486 --> 00:23:12.861
Come on. Come on then!

146
00:24:24.903 --> 00:24:28.403
Hey, Francisco Manoel...
don't your shoes fit?


147
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:45.028
Tell me, did you ever learn
how to use a knife and fork?


148
00:25:04.778 --> 00:25:07.569
The man from Santao doesn't
talk to just anyone!


149
00:25:07.695 --> 00:25:10.029
How many cows did you own?

150
00:26:29.278 --> 00:26:33.737
I have nothing to lose.
I don't have to talk to anybody!


151
00:27:24.319 --> 00:27:28.861
I'll kill the lot of you!
My daughters are all whores.


152
00:27:28.986 --> 00:27:32.361
Rutting with a barefoot cowherd!
Bonita you whore!


153
00:27:32.486 --> 00:27:38.361
Bonita! Bonita! You filthy
little bitch! Bonita pregnant!


154
00:27:38.445 --> 00:27:40.570
My little Bonita pregnant!

155
00:27:40.695 --> 00:27:44.737
Wandeleide! Only fifteen years old
and she's pregnant!


156
00:27:44.862 --> 00:27:49.487
Valkyria! Valkyria! Valkyria!

157
00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:53.111
Valkyria, look me in the eye
and tell me the truth!


158
00:27:53.194 --> 00:27:54.944
Are you pregnant too? Well!

159
00:27:55.027 --> 00:27:58.653
No, I mean yes.
Daddy, I don't know!


160
00:27:58.737 --> 00:28:05.654
Cowherd! Bastard! You!!!
What have you got to say for yourself!


161
00:28:08.403 --> 00:28:14.570
Sugarcane planter.
I am the bandit Cobra Verde.


162
00:28:21.695 --> 00:28:25.028
An outlaw in my own house!

163
00:28:26.528 --> 00:28:31.403
A thief, a bandit, a criminal!

164
00:28:32.403 --> 00:28:34.361
Let's put him on trial.

165
00:28:35.361 --> 00:28:36.695
Just kill him.

166
00:28:36.778 --> 00:28:39.069
The man's too dangerous.

167
00:28:40.194 --> 00:28:44.027
We'd have three or four dead
before we finished him off.


168
00:28:44.361 --> 00:28:47.528
Why not marry him off to
one of your daughters?


169
00:28:47.611 --> 00:28:50.860
After all, isn't he the best man
on your plantation?


170
00:28:51.361 --> 00:28:52.820
I'd have done that...

171
00:28:52.944 --> 00:28:55.986
if the swine hadn't made
all three of them pregnant.


172
00:28:56.069 --> 00:28:58.444
Send him to Africa to buy slaves.

173
00:28:58.528 --> 00:29:00.403
What do you mean : ''buy slaves''?

174
00:29:00.528 --> 00:29:03.319
We haven't had a slave from
Africa in the last ten years.


175
00:29:03.403 --> 00:29:05.403
That's just the point.

176
00:29:08.236 --> 00:29:10.819
We send him to a certain death.

177
00:29:10.944 --> 00:29:13.278
The King of Dahomey is mad.

178
00:29:13.361 --> 00:29:17.111
Anyone who sets foot on
his territory is killed on the spot!


179
00:29:17.194 --> 00:29:20.736
Not one single white man has
come back alive from there...


180
00:29:20.861 --> 00:29:22.944
in the last ten years.

181
00:29:24.861 --> 00:29:29.362
And what if... and what if
the scum does manage it!


182
00:29:30.111 --> 00:29:32.153
He'll never make it. 
I know Africa.

183
00:29:32.236 --> 00:29:33.445
I know the Bight of Benin.

184
00:29:33.528 --> 00:29:37.111
And if he does make it,
he'll bring back so many slaves...


185
00:29:37.236 --> 00:29:40.486
you can extend your plantations
all the way to Sergipe.


186
00:29:41.528 --> 00:29:44.111
Why don't you give him your
oldest daughter to marry?


187
00:29:44.236 --> 00:29:47.027
Yes! Use him any way you can.

188
00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.903
And as for the other two girls...
well, surely you can find...


189
00:29:52.028 --> 00:29:54.654
some sort of husband for them.

190
00:29:54.737 --> 00:29:56.528
If that doesn't appeal to you...

191
00:29:56.653 --> 00:29:59.944
send them to the Carmelite Sisters.
The choice is yours.


192
00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:02.570
I'll kill that pig!

193
00:30:02.695 --> 00:30:05.986
I'll arrange everything
with my friend the governor.


194
00:30:15.653 --> 00:30:19.319
Da Silva... we have
a special assignment...


195
00:30:19.403 --> 00:30:22.486
which we can entrust
only to a capable man.


196
00:30:27.612 --> 00:30:30.570
This is an official certificate
entitling you to practice...


197
00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:31.653
the slave trade.

198
00:30:31.777 --> 00:30:34.528
As you know, this trade
has fallen into stagnation.


199
00:30:34.653 --> 00:30:37.153
The King of Dahomey
has cut off our supplies...


200
00:30:37.278 --> 00:30:39.612
but we know he needs
weapons and money.


201
00:30:39.819 --> 00:30:42.069
So, we propose the following :...

202
00:30:42.194 --> 00:30:46.319
we will send you to our
Fort Elmina in Dahomey.


203
00:30:46.861 --> 00:30:49.695
You will have rank as a lieutenant.

204
00:30:49.777 --> 00:30:52.735
Your wages will be held for you
here in a special bank account...


205
00:30:52.861 --> 00:30:53.861
in Bahia.

206
00:30:53.986 --> 00:30:58.361
In five months' time, a ship with
a cargo of munitions will arrive.


207
00:30:58.486 --> 00:31:00.444
You can pay the king with that.

208
00:31:00.528 --> 00:31:02.861
We've also thought about Angola...

209
00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:05.528
but the English Navy
have it blockaded.


210
00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:08.778
Sailing around the Cape to
the east coast of Africa...


211
00:31:08.861 --> 00:31:12.111
is impossible because the Arabs
monopolize the slave trade...


212
00:31:12.194 --> 00:31:14.194
from Zanzibar on down.

213
00:31:15.236 --> 00:31:17.986
The situation looks very
promising at this time...


214
00:31:18.069 --> 00:31:22.111
because the King of Dahomey
is involved in a war with the Egbas.


215
00:31:22.195 --> 00:31:26.153
And that means that he needs us
just as much as we need him.


216
00:31:26.903 --> 00:31:29.612
When did you last
receive information?


217
00:31:29.694 --> 00:31:34.028
It's been a long time since
we received any messages.


218
00:31:34.111 --> 00:31:37.861
And we can't trust those
reports that we do get.


219
00:31:38.028 --> 00:31:39.654
Will you accept our offer?

220
00:31:45.111 --> 00:31:46.111
Yes.

221
00:31:47.986 --> 00:31:49.819
Congratulations.

222
00:31:51.528 --> 00:31:56.194
Here's your commission,
and the best of luck to you.


223
00:32:00.986 --> 00:32:04.819
We've got a ship to outfit
for a long ocean journey.


224
00:32:10.694 --> 00:32:14.528
Elmina, West Africa

225
00:32:17.361 --> 00:32:19.319
Brazilian slave fortress...

226
00:32:19.445 --> 00:32:23.819
in the country of the sinister,
demented King of Dahomey


227
00:32:38.944 --> 00:32:41.819
Put me ashore - and give me
ten rifles to take along.


228
00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:46.820
None of my crew would dare take you.

229
00:32:46.944 --> 00:32:49.194
I can't force them.
We'll just have to wait...


230
00:32:49.278 --> 00:32:51.570
... and see if the Africans
will come and fetch you.


231
00:32:51.694 --> 00:32:58.028
Nobody there - what's the matter.
Here, take the telescope.


232
00:32:58.153 --> 00:33:00.362
The fort seems dead to the world.

233
00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:11.153
Usually they send out
one of their fetish priests...


234
00:33:11.861 --> 00:33:14.320
praying for us to capsize in the surf.

235
00:33:14.403 --> 00:33:17.819
All flotsam is the property of the king.

236
00:33:18.903 --> 00:33:22.861
I've even seen them strip
a half-drowned sailor naked.


237
00:33:22.944 --> 00:33:24.902
We'll just have to wait
and see what happens.


238
00:33:25.028 --> 00:33:26.945
Thus far, Africa's quite
a disappointment.


239
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:17.195
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!


240
00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:22.611
Where is the barge full of silk?
And the coach and the horses?


241
00:37:22.778 --> 00:37:28.028
What about the trumpets? And
what about the silver hunting rifles?


242
00:37:29.111 --> 00:37:30.736
There will be no gifts.

243
00:37:31.195 --> 00:37:33.028
Not even greyhounds?

244
00:37:35.195 --> 00:37:37.403
Not even greyhounds.

245
00:37:37.903 --> 00:37:40.986
There will be no gifts until your
king resumes the slave trade.


246
00:37:41.111 --> 00:37:42.902
And turns over the fort to me.

247
00:37:48.611 --> 00:37:50.361
Give me one of those rifles!

248
00:37:52.319 --> 00:37:55.070
I'll make payment with rifles.

249
00:37:57.361 --> 00:38:00.028
The powder we have here
takes a long time to speak -


250
00:38:00.153 --> 00:38:02.319
- yours speaks at once.
- Keep it then.


251
00:38:03.111 --> 00:38:06.028
Death to the white men!
Death to the white men!


252
00:38:44.903 --> 00:38:46.778
You can live here if you like.

253
00:38:46.861 --> 00:38:49.694
The west wing's in
reasonable condition.


254
00:38:52.195 --> 00:38:55.695
And... you can help yourself
to one of my daughters.


255
00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.278
She could... She could
live in the castle with you.


256
00:38:59.611 --> 00:39:01.861
Are you running a brothel, or what?

257
00:39:01.945 --> 00:39:04.736
No. I mean I'm doing this for free.

258
00:39:04.986 --> 00:39:07.402
I need something to live on after all...

259
00:39:07.528 --> 00:39:09.862
but I only do this for white men.

260
00:39:09.986 --> 00:39:13.986
And you're the first one
who's come here... for a long time.


261
00:41:23.528 --> 00:41:26.903
Mother of Jesus Christ and all
the saints be praised!


262
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:30.403
I am Taparica, the drum major...

263
00:41:30.528 --> 00:41:32.570
the only survivor of the garrison.

264
00:41:32.695 --> 00:41:34.403
I'm a free Yoruba...

265
00:41:34.528 --> 00:41:37.403
and I served in the First Regiment
of the Black Militia.


266
00:41:37.528 --> 00:41:40.153
Shall I show you where I live?

267
00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:52.152
This is my home...

268
00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:55.903
and these are
my brothers and sisters.


269
00:42:15.319 --> 00:42:16.820
What happened here?

270
00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:20.361
It all started very strangely.

271
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:24.028
They say the king in Abomey
is a little soft in the head.


272
00:42:24.528 --> 00:42:26.695
He found slavery
to be a bad idea.


273
00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:28.528
Instead of sending us slaves...

274
00:42:28.611 --> 00:42:31.903
one day he sent us a
horse with only one ear.


275
00:42:32.027 --> 00:42:33.694
Then they attacked us.

276
00:42:33.945 --> 00:42:38.027
The governor was killed outright
in a skirmish on the coast.


277
00:42:38.152 --> 00:42:41.486
Then they overran the fort
and plundered everything.


278
00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:45.028
The Black Militia ran away, and
all the whites were murdered.


279
00:42:45.152 --> 00:42:47.110
The skulls of the prisoners...

280
00:42:47.194 --> 00:42:49.820
are now decorating the walls
of the Palace in Abomey.


281
00:42:49.945 --> 00:42:52.319
They looted everything,
stole the bells...


282
00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:56.778
and poked the eyes out of all the
portraits in the main building.


283
00:42:58.027 --> 00:43:01.736
Then... they broke open the
rum barrels one by one...


284
00:43:01.862 --> 00:43:03.487
and drank the lot!

285
00:43:03.653 --> 00:43:07.111
They grabbed a cadet and
raped him in the courtyard.


286
00:43:13.361 --> 00:43:17.236
They put ants on my chest...
pepper under my eyelids.


287
00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:21.486
They burnt my tongue because they
claimed we were hiding a treasure.


288
00:43:21.611 --> 00:43:25.069
They were just about to do their
worst when someone exploded...


289
00:43:25.194 --> 00:43:27.486
the powder magazine with
a lighted torch.


290
00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.570
They took seven corpses
from the wreckage...


291
00:43:31.695 --> 00:43:34.445
... and after that
they left me in peace.


292
00:44:41.111 --> 00:44:43.944
We do not know
who is buried where...


293
00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:51.653
but I think this grave here
is the Governor's.


294
00:44:54.278 --> 00:44:56.403
Why did you come...

295
00:44:58.778 --> 00:45:02.444
all alone... without any soldiers?

296
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:06.152
Aren't you afraid...?
Aren't you afraid of dying...?


297
00:45:06.236 --> 00:45:07.944
I never tried it.

298
00:45:28.611 --> 00:45:30.486
What do we do now?

299
00:45:36.695 --> 00:45:38.278
We wait.

300
00:48:00.736 --> 00:48:02.819
Careful with that! Keep it up.

301
00:48:07.028 --> 00:48:10.819
I've never seen a
white man work before!


302
00:48:17.028 --> 00:48:20.570
Get out of my way!
I've got to hold up the front!


303
00:50:31.819 --> 00:50:33.320
Spiritus sanctus...

304
00:50:37.111 --> 00:50:38.111
sanctus...

305
00:50:38.195 --> 00:50:40.320
Come on, let me through here...!

306
00:50:40.652 --> 00:50:43.819
You filthy pig! I don't want to
see you here anymore.


307
00:50:43.944 --> 00:50:45.986
Get out, and stay out!

308
00:51:24.694 --> 00:51:27.736
Only three hundred slaves?
That doesn't make full use...


309
00:51:27.861 --> 00:51:31.070
of the hold capacity, but
it's better than nothing.


310
00:51:31.694 --> 00:51:34.777
Our friends in Brazil will be surprised.

311
00:51:35.028 --> 00:51:38.028
Of course twenty per cent of
the sales price will be paid...


312
00:51:38.153 --> 00:51:39.861
into your bank account.

313
00:51:50.694 --> 00:51:52.195
Have you got any firearms?

314
00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.111
One hundred and forty
with ammunition.


315
00:51:54.195 --> 00:51:55.195
Silk?

316
00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.320
Five bales. lt isn't the best quality...

317
00:51:57.403 --> 00:51:59.236
but here they don't
know the difference.


318
00:51:59.362 --> 00:52:00.362
Rum?

319
00:52:00.486 --> 00:52:01.903
Ten barrels.

320
00:52:03.653 --> 00:52:05.070
How about tobacco?

321
00:52:05.195 --> 00:52:09.486
Unfortunately it got damp and
we had to throw it overboard.


322
00:52:15.028 --> 00:52:18.736
Next time you'll have to bring...
more firearms.


323
00:52:19.486 --> 00:52:23.404
Has that war with the Egbas
flared up again?


324
00:52:27.195 --> 00:52:30.820
The information that
gets here is... incomplete...


325
00:52:30.945 --> 00:52:33.112
We have to rely on guess-work.

326
00:52:36.236 --> 00:52:38.819
May I make a... personal remark.

327
00:52:38.945 --> 00:52:40.279
Go ahead.

328
00:52:41.819 --> 00:52:44.861
We tried to... if I might say so...

329
00:52:44.986 --> 00:52:48.986
consider all the possibilities
when we sent you down here.


330
00:52:49.444 --> 00:52:54.195
But we never expected...
to see you again...


331
00:52:55.195 --> 00:52:58.237
Why do you suppose
they're sending you slaves?


332
00:52:59.527 --> 00:53:01.819
I suppose they need me.

333
00:53:38.195 --> 00:53:41.861
You can best guess their age...
from their teeth.


334
00:53:55.569 --> 00:53:58.402
Actually they're lucky.
We're saving their lives.


335
00:53:58.528 --> 00:54:00.903
During their annual ceremonies,
their customs would have


336
00:54:01.028 --> 00:54:03.278
them sacrificed to the king's
ancestors as messengers.


337
00:54:03.361 --> 00:54:05.778
They'd be dispatched
to the other world.


338
00:54:05.861 --> 00:54:09.944
But now we are sending
them to a wonderful land...


339
00:54:10.028 --> 00:54:13.444
where the cigars grow on trees
and everyone dances.


340
00:54:25.111 --> 00:54:26.861
Find out what's going on!

341
00:54:44.861 --> 00:54:48.736
It is Bossa. Bossa Gelele.
He's the king's older brother.


342
00:54:48.861 --> 00:54:52.319
All men and children with the
first name Bossa are to be killed.


343
00:54:52.402 --> 00:54:55.236
The king can't stand to have
anyone else in his domain...


344
00:54:55.361 --> 00:54:56.736
with his first name, Bossa.

345
00:54:56.861 --> 00:54:59.527
His name is Bossa, Bossa Ahadee.

346
00:55:00.361 --> 00:55:03.195
He knows customs won't allow
him to kill his own brother...


347
00:55:03.319 --> 00:55:04.986
of the solid soil of his kingdom.

348
00:55:05.112 --> 00:55:08.528
That's why he's being taken out
to the sea to be drowned.


349
00:56:22.736 --> 00:56:26.986
White man, when the king searches
for someone, he can't hide.


350
00:56:27.403 --> 00:56:29.987
Even if he flees beneath the earth...

351
00:56:30.194 --> 00:56:32.028
the ground will talk!

352
00:56:36.695 --> 00:56:41.403
The leopard has begotten
a son with a female human.


353
00:56:41.820 --> 00:56:43.486
The leopards mighty claw...

354
00:56:43.569 --> 00:56:46.903
has left an indelible mark
on the child's temples.


355
00:56:47.028 --> 00:56:49.528
Now the holy... 
Leopard's son...

356
00:56:49.611 --> 00:56:52.569
declares that he
loves the white man.


357
00:56:52.736 --> 00:56:55.236
Is the white man in good health?

358
00:56:56.236 --> 00:56:59.194
The new white man
comes from across the sea.


359
00:56:59.611 --> 00:57:01.528
He has seen many things.

360
00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:05.112
The king has prepared a
king's road for him.


361
00:57:05.194 --> 00:57:07.778
The king wishes to see the stranger.

362
00:57:12.861 --> 00:57:16.694
The king has dictated this message
for you to his royal scribe.


363
00:57:20.903 --> 00:57:22.152
I am Portuguese...

364
00:57:22.277 --> 00:57:25.111
held captive by this horrible king
these last sixteen years.


365
00:57:25.194 --> 00:57:27.277
He does not know I am
writing this. Beware!


366
00:57:27.361 --> 00:57:30.361
If you come here, you're a dead man.

367
00:57:30.653 --> 00:57:34.778
Tell his majesty... I must always
have one foot in the sea...


368
00:57:34.987 --> 00:57:36.487
I cannot come.

369
00:57:36.695 --> 00:57:38.029
Seize him.

370
01:00:27.486 --> 01:00:30.361
Abomey
Residence of the King


371
01:01:24.403 --> 01:01:26.986
I wish I had your skin.

372
01:01:27.695 --> 01:01:30.737
The black people believe
the Devil is white.


373
01:04:41.653 --> 01:04:43.777
The leopard has risen.

374
01:04:46.111 --> 01:04:48.236
The leopard takes his seat.

375
01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:55.694
Dada, breathe for me! Dada, steal
from me. Dada, break my bones.


376
01:04:56.403 --> 01:05:00.861
Take me! My head is yours.
My body is yours. Take me.


377
01:05:01.361 --> 01:05:05.861
It's yours. I'm all yours.
Dada! Please!


378
01:05:09.528 --> 01:05:11.653
The bush king takes his seat.

379
01:05:22.153 --> 01:05:24.153
What does that mean?

380
01:05:27.195 --> 01:05:31.070
That is the bush king.
He doesn't exist.


381
01:05:31.195 --> 01:05:33.986
That is, he only exists
in the king's imagination.


382
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:36.236
But the two kings rule together.

383
01:05:39.361 --> 01:05:41.069
The leopard speaks!

384
01:05:41.819 --> 01:05:45.819
For the annual ceremony
all dogs must be slaughtered -


385
01:05:46.153 --> 01:05:48.986
the preceding night
at the Gate of Tears.


386
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:53.611
The dogs assemble in the streets,
and try to talk like humans.


387
01:05:53.694 --> 01:05:58.570
But if they succeed, it will
bring a plague upon the people.


388
01:06:16.111 --> 01:06:18.652
We must conquer the Egbas!

389
01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:28.028
We shall break Abeokuta!

390
01:06:32.694 --> 01:06:35.278
My house needs thatching!

391
01:06:40.195 --> 01:06:43.903
I'll thatch my roof with
the skulls of my enemies.


392
01:07:05.361 --> 01:07:10.111
How are my brethren?
Answer, white man before I kill you!


393
01:07:13.361 --> 01:07:17.694
How is the health
of the King of Prussia?


394
01:07:21.195 --> 01:07:27.320
How is my brother,
the Tsar of Russia?


395
01:07:29.861 --> 01:07:36.070
And how is Queen Victoria,
whose heart is a big calabash...


396
01:07:36.195 --> 01:07:40.153
overflowing with palm wine
for the thirsty man?


397
01:07:42.527 --> 01:07:45.445
I can't hear what you said...

398
01:07:45.527 --> 01:07:47.736
I can't hear you.

399
01:08:06.195 --> 01:08:11.362
Prepare for your death, stranger.
Time doesn't occur to the king.


400
01:08:39.445 --> 01:08:43.861
The Devil is white. Death is white!
All whites are half dead.


401
01:09:05.486 --> 01:09:09.611
That's what they always do before
they behead a white man.


402
01:09:15.362 --> 01:09:17.987
They have painted your face black...

403
01:09:18.819 --> 01:09:22.028
because they are not
allowed to kill a white man.


404
01:09:23.569 --> 01:09:25.652
I'm not afraid of you.

405
01:09:30.111 --> 01:09:34.153
In this place, the dead are
more alive than the living.


406
01:09:39.653 --> 01:09:43.653
No one may see the leopard
while he drinks.


407
01:09:54.903 --> 01:10:01.112
Hey, white man. One day
I will drink from your skull!


408
01:10:03.402 --> 01:10:07.111
This was the King of the Mahis.

409
01:10:26.819 --> 01:10:32.986
The dead eat so...
The dead drink so.


410
01:10:44.195 --> 01:10:49.945
I have sworn, in my swearinghouse...
to conquer the Egbas.


411
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:55.444
I fear nobody.
I have only one fear.


412
01:10:55.778 --> 01:10:58.319
And that is that one day...

413
01:10:58.736 --> 01:11:03.153
there may be anyone left
to be conquered.


414
01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:09.319
But tell me, white man...
why have the Portuguese...


415
01:11:09.945 --> 01:11:15.361
brought three hundred and thirty-five
thousand warships to my shore?


416
01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:21.820
And why did you
poison my greyhound?


417
01:12:34.736 --> 01:12:37.778
The snow... the... snow.

418
01:13:22.194 --> 01:13:24.569
Quickly! Quickly! 
Kill the guards!

419
01:13:30.528 --> 01:13:32.903
I am Bakoko,
the confidant of the prince.


420
01:13:33.028 --> 01:13:35.236
Prince Kankpe is waiting for you.
Quickly, stranger, come with me!


421
01:13:35.361 --> 01:13:38.112
Where is Taparica!
You must take Taparica along!


422
01:13:52.778 --> 01:13:55.112
Why did you free us?

423
01:13:55.861 --> 01:14:00.861
Prince Kankpe has decided to
revolt against his uncle Ahadee.


424
01:14:01.028 --> 01:14:03.319
He is the rightful heir to the throne.

425
01:14:04.653 --> 01:14:08.528
Yesterday, King Bossa Ahadee
went up north with his entire army.


426
01:14:09.194 --> 01:14:11.820
Out there live many hills.

427
01:14:16.945 --> 01:14:22.570
We must overcome Bossa Ahadee.
But we'll need your help to do it.


428
01:14:23.236 --> 01:14:25.319
Our rebel warriors
have all disappointed us.


429
01:14:25.444 --> 01:14:28.028
The women are much more brave.

430
01:14:34.945 --> 01:14:36.653
My father.

431
01:14:38.528 --> 01:14:40.987
The traitor must die.

432
01:14:41.111 --> 01:14:44.570
He has opened up the
graves of our ancestors!


433
01:15:07.987 --> 01:15:10.653
We will go down to
the fortress on the coast...


434
01:15:10.736 --> 01:15:13.611
and there we will establish
an army of Amazons.


435
01:15:16.069 --> 01:15:19.778
The prince would like to make a
pact of blood brotherhood with you.


436
01:15:20.444 --> 01:15:23.945
Blood brothers do not kill each other.

437
01:15:26.486 --> 01:15:29.486
lf the new king will turn over
the slave trade to me...


438
01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:31.152
...then I am his man.

439
01:15:33.611 --> 01:15:36.778
Does he have the vaguest notion
what we're talking about?


440
01:15:38.862 --> 01:15:42.320
He is in agreement.
He has no choice.


441
01:15:45.278 --> 01:15:48.862
He says yes to anything.
You see, he is quite insane.


442
01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:19.111
All right! Over there!
What a wretched mess.


443
01:16:19.528 --> 01:16:22.611
Listen to me! I said over there!
All of you!


444
01:16:29.403 --> 01:16:32.153
You'll have to get up quicker,
if you don't want to get killed.


445
01:16:46.528 --> 01:16:48.528
I've got four hundred new recruits.
Where do you want them?


446
01:16:48.611 --> 01:16:50.069
Not over here.
Take them down to the shore.


447
01:16:50.194 --> 01:16:51.903
They all want to fight!
They want to kill all the men.


448
01:16:52.027 --> 01:16:52.985
Don't bother me now.

449
01:16:53.153 --> 01:16:56.153
I've got to get this herd
of women organized first.


450
01:17:02.653 --> 01:17:04.820
- Shields up!
- Watch what you do with that spear!


451
01:17:13.486 --> 01:17:15.653
All right! Now, fight!

452
01:17:20.528 --> 01:17:21.986
No, you've got it all wrong!

453
01:17:22.069 --> 01:17:24.653
You've got to hold
your spear like this...


454
01:17:24.736 --> 01:17:27.152
and keep your feet moving.
Like this!


455
01:17:33.528 --> 01:17:36.570
Here, you take it.

456
01:17:38.361 --> 01:17:39.944
Attack, damn you!

457
01:17:47.069 --> 01:17:50.528
Let's have that cutlass!
Come on, attack! Attack!


458
01:17:50.653 --> 01:17:53.069
Keep your spear up!
Defend yourself.


459
01:17:53.194 --> 01:17:55.152
Cover your body with the shield!

460
01:17:55.278 --> 01:18:01.653
lf you trip and fall,
it's the end of you! Haaa! Haaa!


461
01:18:08.027 --> 01:18:10.402
Come on! Get a move on!

462
01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:04.194
One! Two!

463
01:19:05.695 --> 01:19:08.695
Three! Four!

464
01:19:09.861 --> 01:19:11.737
Five! And take the enemy!

465
01:19:15.028 --> 01:19:18.278
Not bad... All right, now get
back in your starting positions.


466
01:19:18.361 --> 01:19:22.570
Come on, quicker, keep moving!

467
01:19:24.695 --> 01:19:28.028
And now... ready!?

468
01:19:28.361 --> 01:19:31.236
Attack position.
No, no, no, no!... At ease!


469
01:19:31.944 --> 01:19:35.653
The whole thing again faster!
In position!


470
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:42.779
One! Two! Three!

471
01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:48.403
Who told them they could take a rest?

472
01:20:27.403 --> 01:20:29.695
Who told them they could take a rest?

473
01:20:29.819 --> 01:20:31.695
On your feet now, come on.

474
01:20:31.861 --> 01:20:34.612
- Keep on moving!
- Come on, come on!


475
01:20:34.695 --> 01:20:35.695
Get up!

476
01:20:35.819 --> 01:20:38.902
We don't want to practice anymore.
We want to fight!


477
01:20:39.028 --> 01:20:43.487
I swear I will bring back Bossa
Ahadee's head - single-handed!


478
01:20:43.695 --> 01:20:45.403
No, you're not yet ready.

479
01:20:45.528 --> 01:20:51.319
You've got to keep on practicing.
You've got to obey my orders.


480
01:20:51.403 --> 01:20:54.986
Come on. I don't want to hear
any more from you.


481
01:20:55.111 --> 01:20:58.320
I want you to hear what
I have to say. I command here.


482
01:20:58.445 --> 01:21:02.403
No one else! And we're going
to continue practicing.


483
01:21:02.528 --> 01:21:05.861
No more arguments from you.
Only that way can we succeed.


484
01:21:06.986 --> 01:21:09.236
We will storm the palace
soon enough.


485
01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.903
I've made my decision! We attack!

486
01:21:23.694 --> 01:21:28.486
We march out tomorrow.
Fight, fight, fight, fight...


487
01:21:31.694 --> 01:21:34.861
Fight, fight, fight, fight...

488
01:22:17.819 --> 01:22:20.528
Off to Abomey!

489
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:33.820
They have taken the
sacred python from the temple.


490
01:24:33.944 --> 01:24:36.527
We must turn back -
nobody gets past it alive!


491
01:24:36.652 --> 01:24:39.194
In my country, 
I was a snake myself!

492
01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.070
Out of the way! Attack! Attack!

493
01:25:32.611 --> 01:25:35.237
The dead kings have deposed you.

494
01:25:37.153 --> 01:25:39.653
So, now I will go and sleep.

495
01:25:43.278 --> 01:25:46.694
Wall up the doors
to the women's quarters.


496
01:26:02.527 --> 01:26:06.986
No! Don't let him get away!
Stop him! Hold Him!


497
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:10.695
Stay back. His wives will
strangle him now.


498
01:26:28.195 --> 01:26:31.028
The new king takes his seat!

499
01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:35.819
Shall I ask him to approach?

500
01:27:06.237 --> 01:27:09.112
He has given you
the name Adjinakou -


501
01:27:09.195 --> 01:27:11.320
that means ''green snake''.

502
01:27:11.402 --> 01:27:14.903
He has appointed you
Viceroy of Dahomey.


503
01:27:15.611 --> 01:27:20.070
Our King Kankpe gives you Fort
Elmina as your official residence.


504
01:27:59.444 --> 01:28:02.986
We have to remove the glass
windows from the main house.


505
01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:05.319
The servants sprinkled
them with water...


506
01:28:05.402 --> 01:28:08.236
because they believed the
rising sun set them on fire.


507
01:28:08.361 --> 01:28:09.444
You'd do better to see to it...

508
01:28:09.528 --> 01:28:11.820
the ventilation in the slave
quarters is improved.


509
01:28:11.903 --> 01:28:14.569
- Too many are dying.
- Yes, Adjinakou.


510
01:28:17.528 --> 01:28:19.528
We'll have to get them shipped faster.

511
01:28:19.653 --> 01:28:22.611
The captain of the Flor de Bahia
has the best quarters in town -


512
01:28:22.694 --> 01:28:24.903
I gave him the east wing.

513
01:28:25.153 --> 01:28:26.986
And the relays are all prepared.

514
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:29.319
Tomorrow they will all be in position.

515
01:28:29.402 --> 01:28:32.153
The distance is twenty-three
thousand five hundred bamboo poles.


516
01:28:32.277 --> 01:28:34.778
That will be a great
surprise for our king.


517
01:28:48.569 --> 01:28:52.652
They're offering you a place in
the syndicate back in Bahia.


518
01:28:53.569 --> 01:28:55.694
I don't need that crap!

519
01:28:56.403 --> 01:28:58.987
And why haven't I received
the ships that I asked for?


520
01:28:59.112 --> 01:29:01.029
I don't know, Don Francisco.

521
01:29:02.569 --> 01:29:04.736
But I will bring it to
the governor's attention...


522
01:29:04.861 --> 01:29:07.319
- as soon as I return.
- This is an outrage!


523
01:29:23.945 --> 01:29:27.653
This is the second shipment of slaves
you've received without payment.


524
01:29:27.778 --> 01:29:30.736
I'm not sure I can trust your word.

525
01:30:03.444 --> 01:30:05.861
Sometimes I get a bit tired.

526
01:30:08.986 --> 01:30:11.527
Tonight I won't take any of them.

527
01:30:12.403 --> 01:30:14.653
Which one would you like to have?

528
01:30:19.277 --> 01:30:20.277
That one.

529
01:30:21.194 --> 01:30:22.986
You there - come on up!

530
01:30:27.403 --> 01:30:28.737
Yes, you!

531
01:30:31.028 --> 01:30:33.402
lf they get pregnant,
they aren't taken aboard.


532
01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:35.653
Then they get their own hut out here.

533
01:30:36.194 --> 01:30:38.820
We've already got
a whole village full of them.


534
01:30:38.903 --> 01:30:43.945
- Who are these women?
- Our future murderers.


535
01:31:11.736 --> 01:31:14.486
Send the signals!
I want to write a letter for you...


536
01:31:14.569 --> 01:31:16.277
to take back to my partners in Brazil.

537
01:31:16.361 --> 01:31:18.152
It's going to take about
an hour and a half...


538
01:31:18.278 --> 01:31:20.029
before I get an
answering signal anyway.


539
01:32:22.236 --> 01:32:27.153
I cannot begin to describe this
cretinous existence of mine.


540
01:32:27.361 --> 01:32:32.486
Nor how lonely it is to be
without family or friends.


541
01:32:32.987 --> 01:32:35.403
The only white man in this country...

542
01:32:35.528 --> 01:32:37.528
perhaps on this whole continent.

543
01:32:39.528 --> 01:32:42.611
Meanwhile I have become the
father of sixty-two children...


544
01:32:42.695 --> 01:32:45.111
but this gives me no satisfaction.

545
01:32:45.361 --> 01:32:48.987
Perhaps next year
I shall come back and marry.


546
01:32:50.403 --> 01:32:53.361
I would live in the lands
of ice and snow...


547
01:32:53.444 --> 01:32:56.110
anywhere to be away from here...

548
01:33:00.486 --> 01:33:04.069
The heat here is
mean and inescapable.


549
01:33:04.903 --> 01:33:08.152
It courses through the
bodies of the people like a fever -


550
01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:12.695
and yet my heart grows
colder and colder.


551
01:33:42.611 --> 01:33:47.152
Adjinakou... there's
an answer coming back.


552
01:34:22.319 --> 01:34:26.194
The king sends his brother the
Royal Leopard Salute.


553
01:34:36.361 --> 01:34:40.319
This one's about nineteen -
looks strong and healthy.


554
01:34:45.862 --> 01:34:49.320
He must be about twenty-five -
a good, hard boy.


555
01:34:49.445 --> 01:34:54.362
This one's about the same age.
And he's a very strong boy also.


556
01:37:17.861 --> 01:37:21.320
- You obviously like my nuns' choir.
- Nun's choir. Not bad.


557
01:37:21.445 --> 01:37:24.028
Do you know Pedro Vincente,
the captain of the Flor de Bahia?


558
01:37:24.153 --> 01:37:25.695
Yes, I do.

559
01:37:26.194 --> 01:37:28.735
How much would some
interesting news be worth to you?


560
01:37:28.861 --> 01:37:30.153
I won't cheat you.

561
01:37:33.111 --> 01:37:36.320
Pedro Vincente took a large
consignment of slaves off your hands.


562
01:37:36.445 --> 01:37:37.903
He never paid.

563
01:37:39.361 --> 01:37:42.194
Then let me tell you what
I saw with my own eyes.


564
01:37:42.278 --> 01:37:44.819
The Flor de Bahia was
brimming over with cargo.


565
01:37:44.944 --> 01:37:47.570
He cheated you.

566
01:37:48.486 --> 01:37:52.152
He's gone and dumped all his
weapons and goods to the British -


567
01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:54.320
made a double profit on the deal.

568
01:37:54.445 --> 01:37:56.945
And guess what happened
to the Flor de Bahia!


569
01:37:57.028 --> 01:38:00.736
She's drifting off shore
near Lagos... unseaworthy.


570
01:38:00.861 --> 01:38:02.986
And on top of that,
the crew has mutinied...


571
01:38:03.069 --> 01:38:05.152
which means now
you've got him trapped.


572
01:38:09.986 --> 01:38:14.570
You take a cutter and deliver
a message to Captain Vincente.


573
01:38:14.694 --> 01:38:18.570
''Come here. I'll re-equip you.
Nobody cheats me twice.''


574
01:38:45.195 --> 01:38:47.736
Come on, move on...
and take everything.


575
01:38:49.861 --> 01:38:53.236
Hey! What is the meaning of this?

576
01:38:53.652 --> 01:38:59.153
Our King Kankpe was never insane.
He only pretended to be.


577
01:38:59.861 --> 01:39:03.153
He thanks his brother,
who was once the viceroy.


578
01:39:03.445 --> 01:39:05.861
The blood brother of the king
was a big tree...


579
01:39:05.944 --> 01:39:07.486
... and that's what he
wants you to know.


580
01:39:07.570 --> 01:39:10.195
Why does the king speak
of me only in the past tense?


581
01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:11.903
Adjinakou, things look very bad...

582
01:39:12.028 --> 01:39:14.195
but as long as Kankpe is king
you're fairly safe.


583
01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.445
He would never kill a blood brother.

584
01:39:17.652 --> 01:39:19.153
There are still some rifles in there.

585
01:39:19.278 --> 01:39:22.195
Where's his money?
Come on, hurry up!


586
01:40:03.986 --> 01:40:08.111
- Do you really want to help me?
- I keep my word.


587
01:40:08.195 --> 01:40:10.070
But that won't help me anymore...

588
01:40:10.195 --> 01:40:12.028
and it won't help you either!

589
01:40:12.611 --> 01:40:14.529
Brazil's joined the rest of the world...

590
01:40:14.652 --> 01:40:16.194
and abolished the slave trade.

591
01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:18.111
Any shipments currently under way...

592
01:40:18.195 --> 01:40:20.237
will be seized on the high seas.

593
01:40:21.195 --> 01:40:23.112
In the eyes of the law...

594
01:40:23.195 --> 01:40:28.070
Fort Elmina and our lives
have ceased to exist.


595
01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:30.653
And while I'm at it,
there's something else.


596
01:40:30.778 --> 01:40:33.529
I know that for at least one year...

597
01:40:33.652 --> 01:40:37.486
you've been slandered and cheated
by your partners in Bahia.


598
01:40:37.611 --> 01:40:40.820
Your assets have all been
confiscated by the state bank.


599
01:40:40.903 --> 01:40:44.778
And in addition, the English
have put a price on your head.


600
01:40:47.527 --> 01:40:49.819
Finally something's happened.

601
01:40:54.362 --> 01:40:58.070
Finally something's happened.

602
01:41:04.111 --> 01:41:05.652
To slavery...

603
01:41:05.944 --> 01:41:10.153
the greatest misunderstanding
in the history of mankind!


604
01:41:12.694 --> 01:41:18.485
It was no misunderstanding.
It was a crime.


605
01:41:25.778 --> 01:41:33.320
Slavery is an element of the
human heart... To our ruin!


606
01:47:40.528 --> 01:47:49.070
The slaves will sell their masters
and grow wings.
