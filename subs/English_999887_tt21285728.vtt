00:01:25.283 --> 00:01:27.503
The person
you are trying to reach--


2
00:01:27.503 --> 00:01:29.273
Sam.

3
00:01:29.273 --> 00:01:30.593
Sam.

4
00:01:30.593 --> 00:01:32.613
is
currently unavailable.


5
00:01:32.613 --> 00:01:34.613
Please leave your
message after the beep.


6
00:01:34.613 --> 00:01:35.973
Hey, Sam.

7
00:01:35.973 --> 00:01:36.773
It's your mom.

8
00:01:36.773 --> 00:01:37.613
Psych!

9
00:01:37.613 --> 00:01:38.603
It's your therapist.

10
00:01:38.603 --> 00:01:39.693
Don't get your hopes up.

11
00:01:39.693 --> 00:01:41.003
I have to push our session.

12
00:01:41.003 --> 00:01:43.190
I had some last minute shopping.

13
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.023
You're probably at your
little theater, so--


14
00:01:45.023 --> 00:01:47.703
I don't know-- write some
more plays or something.


15
00:01:47.703 --> 00:01:48.503
Bye-bye.

16
00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:58.033
Enter.

17
00:01:58.033 --> 00:01:59.893
Come on in, Sam.

18
00:01:59.893 --> 00:02:02.273
Sit down.

19
00:02:02.273 --> 00:02:05.873
Well, I bet you're wondering,
oh, what's going on?


20
00:02:05.873 --> 00:02:06.743
Yes, yes.

21
00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:08.201
See,
that's theater--


22
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:09.913
palpable tension.

23
00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:11.663
Um, are you
still doing my play?


24
00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:15.866
Because I love writing plays
and being around actors.


25
00:02:16.823 --> 00:02:18.933
Of course,
rain's coming in.


26
00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:19.733
Yes.

27
00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:20.693
Here's the new draft.

28
00:02:20.693 --> 00:02:23.273
Ah, great.

29
00:02:23.273 --> 00:02:26.213
Well, you sure do love
Southerners, don't you?


30
00:02:26.213 --> 00:02:28.433
They kind of
shoot from the hip in a way


31
00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:31.133
that I respond to,
and in a way I kind


32
00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:32.423
of wish I was more like that.

33
00:02:32.423 --> 00:02:35.153
Greggy Thompson
was slated to direct.


34
00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:36.432
The
great Greggy, yeah.


35
00:02:36.432 --> 00:02:37.234
Was?

36
00:02:37.234 --> 00:02:38.508
But
we have decided


37
00:02:38.508 --> 00:02:41.753
that we want you, the scribe.

38
00:02:41.753 --> 00:02:42.793
To direct?
No.


39
00:02:42.793 --> 00:02:43.593
Yes.

40
00:02:43.593 --> 00:02:44.483
Oh, no.

41
00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:46.583
I'm not someone
who could do that.


42
00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:50.293
I think that there's got
to be someone better.


43
00:02:50.293 --> 00:02:51.213
I'm trying to think.

44
00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:52.873
Um, Darlene O'Donnell?

45
00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:53.673
She could be good.

46
00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.503
She's
got a gig off-Broadway.


47
00:02:55.503 --> 00:02:58.623
Oh, April
Slattery is really talented.


48
00:02:58.623 --> 00:03:00.295
Had
a baby a week ago.


49
00:03:00.295 --> 00:03:02.253
Sheldon, I'm
beginning to feel like I


50
00:03:02.253 --> 00:03:04.719
wasn't your first choice here.

51
00:03:09.603 --> 00:03:10.773
Where's Greggy?

52
00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:12.093
Greggy Schmeggy.

53
00:03:12.093 --> 00:03:13.653
Just say yes!

54
00:03:13.653 --> 00:03:16.083
It'll be magic to
have our first female


55
00:03:16.083 --> 00:03:18.573
kick off our 29th season.

56
00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:21.423
I mean, you can, you
know, recast all--


57
00:03:21.423 --> 00:03:23.163
all ladies if you want.

58
00:03:23.163 --> 00:03:23.963
Whatever.

59
00:03:23.963 --> 00:03:24.765
Well,
that wouldn't work


60
00:03:24.765 --> 00:03:26.433
because it's a family drama.

61
00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:28.263
Oh, yes!

62
00:03:28.263 --> 00:03:29.703
Yeah.

63
00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:31.293
Of course, your
rate would double.


64
00:03:31.293 --> 00:03:32.373
I accept.

65
00:03:32.373 --> 00:03:33.663
Hallelujah.

66
00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:35.103
- That's great.
- I accept.


67
00:03:35.103 --> 00:03:35.903
OK.

68
00:03:35.903 --> 00:03:37.233
You got to be confident.

69
00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:39.303
Because these actors are hyenas.

70
00:03:39.303 --> 00:03:40.903
And if you falter
in front of them,


71
00:03:40.903 --> 00:03:43.471
it'll be your blood
dripping off their face fur.


72
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:44.763
OK, well, then I'll--

73
00:03:44.763 --> 00:03:46.293
I'll become a lion.

74
00:03:46.293 --> 00:03:48.453
I'll be like a mama lioness.

75
00:03:48.453 --> 00:03:50.013
A
pack of hyenas can


76
00:03:50.013 --> 00:03:51.783
easily tear apart a lioness.

77
00:03:51.783 --> 00:03:55.443
But it's a good general
mindset to start out with.


78
00:03:55.443 --> 00:03:56.523
Mama lion!

79
00:03:56.523 --> 00:03:58.143
- Rawr, rawr!
- Oh, boy.


80
00:03:58.143 --> 00:03:59.403
I'm a lion.
Rawr, rawr!


81
00:04:03.363 --> 00:04:05.343
Yes.

82
00:04:05.343 --> 00:04:06.828
This one.

83
00:04:06.828 --> 00:04:09.303
That's me.

84
00:04:09.303 --> 00:04:11.283
That's me, sir.

85
00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:12.283
That's me.

86
00:04:12.283 --> 00:04:14.053
You
work at that theater?


87
00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.873
Yes, I do.

88
00:04:15.873 --> 00:04:16.863
I'm a director.

89
00:04:16.863 --> 00:04:18.822
No shit?

90
00:04:18.822 --> 00:04:19.622
Actor.

91
00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:22.173
Hey, maybe you
could get me a job.


92
00:04:22.173 --> 00:04:23.533
You're right.

93
00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:24.715
Maybe I could.

94
00:04:24.715 --> 00:04:26.423
Well, I
know where you live.


95
00:04:26.423 --> 00:04:28.198
And I know your name.

96
00:04:28.198 --> 00:04:29.573
I do not know how
to contact you.


97
00:04:29.573 --> 00:04:31.283
And my driver
information does not


98
00:04:31.283 --> 00:04:33.023
have any contact info for me.

99
00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:34.538
So we may have to exchange--

100
00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:36.413
I'm sure we'll
bump into each other


101
00:04:36.413 --> 00:04:40.193
again because I'm
constantly taking Zooms.


102
00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:42.143
This is
where you live, right?


103
00:04:42.143 --> 00:04:43.601
Yeah, I
kind of usually--


104
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:45.320
- we actually overshot it.
- Oh.


105
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.653
I can take you right back there.

106
00:04:46.653 --> 00:04:47.778
No, this is good.

107
00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:48.893
I'll get out here.

108
00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:50.663
Thank you.

109
00:04:50.663 --> 00:04:52.343
Good
old brick and stucco.


110
00:04:53.423 --> 00:04:54.683
I know where you live.

111
00:04:54.683 --> 00:04:56.663
Yeah, I put my
neighbors coordinates.


112
00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.253
Coordinates?
You live next door?


113
00:04:58.253 --> 00:04:59.711
Yeah, I
live in the area.


114
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:01.903
This one's just--
either are fine.


115
00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:02.703
Bye!

116
00:05:05.613 --> 00:05:08.460
Back to my place!

117
00:05:26.943 --> 00:05:28.953
Guys, places, please.

118
00:05:28.953 --> 00:05:30.243
Places.

119
00:05:30.243 --> 00:05:32.623
All right, you in the
back, can you sit down?


120
00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:33.423
Yes.

121
00:05:33.423 --> 00:05:36.963
When the hand goes up,
whoop, everyone quiet.


122
00:05:36.963 --> 00:05:39.513
I'm your director.

123
00:05:39.513 --> 00:05:43.133
I'm a director.

124
00:05:56.973 --> 00:06:02.103
I don't know how to describe
it except it's like I just


125
00:06:02.103 --> 00:06:06.543
suddenly feel like I exist.

126
00:06:06.543 --> 00:06:07.623
You got a gig.

127
00:06:07.623 --> 00:06:08.583
Yes.

128
00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:10.593
I'm happy.

129
00:06:10.593 --> 00:06:13.023
How do you know?

130
00:06:13.023 --> 00:06:15.493
Could I
be tricking myself?


131
00:06:15.493 --> 00:06:17.633
Mm-hmm.

132
00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:18.483
Oh.

133
00:06:18.483 --> 00:06:20.763
Do you hate yourself?

134
00:06:20.763 --> 00:06:24.223
I mean,
sometimes I'm just like,


135
00:06:24.223 --> 00:06:28.433
other people are better
than you, and you suck.


136
00:06:28.433 --> 00:06:29.233
Yeah.

137
00:06:29.233 --> 00:06:31.460
But hate?

138
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.293
I'm going to
put you down for yes.


139
00:06:33.293 --> 00:06:34.123
OK.

140
00:06:34.123 --> 00:06:36.290
But, you know,
therapy is crucial for you.


141
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.223
With your aloof parents, and
your loner mentality, and your


142
00:06:39.223 --> 00:06:41.323
deep insecurities, you need it.

143
00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:45.673
In other news-- and
yes, I too bear news--


144
00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:48.493
I'm changing my billing
system to the Square.


145
00:06:48.493 --> 00:06:50.341
And I don't want
you to be startled


146
00:06:50.341 --> 00:06:52.382
at the end of our session,
so I'm letting you know now.


147
00:06:52.382 --> 00:06:53.184
OK.

148
00:06:53.184 --> 00:06:54.793
So you can
emotionally prepare.


149
00:06:55.593 --> 00:06:56.913
Oh.

150
00:06:56.913 --> 00:06:59.883
Oh, it's from my theater.

151
00:06:59.883 --> 00:07:01.803
It's a community meeting.

152
00:07:01.803 --> 00:07:02.913
Damn, it's so soon.

153
00:07:02.913 --> 00:07:04.203
I don't have on good makeup.

154
00:07:04.203 --> 00:07:05.703
I just don't want to look mousy.

155
00:07:05.703 --> 00:07:07.121
This is a big opportunity.

156
00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:08.767
Oh, I have
a cosmetology license.


157
00:07:08.767 --> 00:07:09.569
You do?

158
00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:10.905
I could
do your makeup.


159
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:19.269
Mama lion.

160
00:07:27.303 --> 00:07:28.103
What?

161
00:07:28.103 --> 00:07:28.923
Gerald, come on.

162
00:07:28.923 --> 00:07:30.673
Give me my light, will you?

163
00:07:30.673 --> 00:07:33.573
Gerald, what are you doing?

164
00:07:33.573 --> 00:07:35.173
Cut it out!

165
00:07:35.173 --> 00:07:39.453
That
is the best bit.


166
00:07:39.453 --> 00:07:40.773
Come on.

167
00:07:40.773 --> 00:07:43.511
I sign your checks, Gerald!

168
00:07:49.803 --> 00:07:51.753
Ahem.

169
00:07:51.753 --> 00:07:58.323
Thespians, ushers,
box office personnel,


170
00:07:58.323 --> 00:08:01.978
costume designers,
stage managers, and yes,


171
00:08:01.978 --> 00:08:02.833
even techies--

172
00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:04.083
Fucking dick.

173
00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:06.003
Stupid bitch.

174
00:08:06.003 --> 00:08:07.773
It has
come to my attention


175
00:08:07.773 --> 00:08:11.363
that our beloved
director, Greggy Thompson,


176
00:08:11.363 --> 00:08:14.993
had non-traditional
relationships with cast members


177
00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:18.443
in every play he directed.

178
00:08:18.443 --> 00:08:20.483
Greggy is stepping down.

179
00:08:20.483 --> 00:08:21.683
What?

180
00:08:21.683 --> 00:08:22.523
OK.

181
00:08:22.523 --> 00:08:26.873
Now I'm going to announce
Greggy's replacement.


182
00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:29.393
She is a female, which
is just the medicine


183
00:08:29.393 --> 00:08:30.653
we need right now--

184
00:08:30.653 --> 00:08:32.423
Sam Clifford!

185
00:08:38.175 --> 00:08:40.493
Oh, whoa.

186
00:08:40.493 --> 00:08:41.483
Oh, no.

187
00:08:41.483 --> 00:08:44.063
Gerald, where's my
spotlight action?


188
00:08:44.063 --> 00:08:45.523
Let's dance, baby.

189
00:08:45.523 --> 00:08:46.323
Ah, ah!

190
00:08:46.323 --> 00:08:48.383
Come on.

191
00:08:48.383 --> 00:08:49.623
OK.

192
00:08:49.623 --> 00:08:51.293
We'll do it some other time.

193
00:08:51.293 --> 00:08:53.393
I am Sam Clifford.

194
00:08:53.393 --> 00:08:54.753
Hi, friends.

195
00:08:54.753 --> 00:08:57.533
I know the mood is a
little iffy right now,


196
00:08:57.533 --> 00:09:00.473
but I just want you to know
from the bottom of my heart,


197
00:09:00.473 --> 00:09:02.463
I believe victims.

198
00:09:02.463 --> 00:09:04.163
And that's what you are.

199
00:09:04.163 --> 00:09:05.093
Sorry if I look crazy.

200
00:09:05.093 --> 00:09:07.470
My therapist did my makeup.

201
00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.143
Thank you very much.

202
00:09:09.143 --> 00:09:09.943
I sound like Elvis.

203
00:09:09.943 --> 00:09:10.983
Ah, getting in my head.

204
00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:11.783
Thanks, guys.

205
00:09:11.783 --> 00:09:13.373
I'm going to be a mama lion.

206
00:09:13.373 --> 00:09:15.103
I'm going to protect you.
Rawr!


207
00:09:15.103 --> 00:09:15.903
OK.

208
00:09:15.903 --> 00:09:17.106
We'll see you soon.

209
00:09:17.106 --> 00:09:18.023
Holy shit.

210
00:09:22.003 --> 00:09:23.153
Hey, Sam.

211
00:09:23.153 --> 00:09:23.953
Wait up.

212
00:09:23.953 --> 00:09:25.273
Whoa, Greggy.

213
00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:26.833
That was a
great speech back there.


214
00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:28.573
Oh, thank you.
That means a lot.


215
00:09:28.573 --> 00:09:30.698
Yeah, I just kind of had
to make it up on the spot,


216
00:09:30.698 --> 00:09:32.333
- but I was happy with it.
- Hey, listen.


217
00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:33.791
Walk and talk with
me for a second.


218
00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:36.208
I keep my car parked down
here so she don't get dinged.


219
00:09:38.853 --> 00:09:41.533
I can see you as a director.

220
00:09:41.533 --> 00:09:42.603
You do?

221
00:09:42.603 --> 00:09:43.683
Of course.

222
00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:45.423
You're super duper.

223
00:09:45.423 --> 00:09:48.343
You are a very
special person, OK?


224
00:09:48.343 --> 00:09:49.143
You know that.

225
00:09:49.143 --> 00:09:50.153
Right, kid?

226
00:09:50.153 --> 00:09:52.500
I think I do, yeah.

227
00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.833
She is my stingray.

228
00:09:53.833 --> 00:09:54.853
Yeah.

229
00:09:54.853 --> 00:09:55.653
Look.

230
00:09:55.653 --> 00:09:57.103
You're going to make theater.

231
00:09:57.103 --> 00:09:58.043
That's the dream.

232
00:09:58.043 --> 00:09:58.843
Right?

233
00:09:58.843 --> 00:10:03.883
I lost my dream because of some
bad judgment or some bad luck.


234
00:10:03.883 --> 00:10:05.803
Really, some vindictive phonies.

235
00:10:05.803 --> 00:10:08.023
The point is, I'm here for you.

236
00:10:08.023 --> 00:10:09.583
Hey, I'm damn good.

237
00:10:09.583 --> 00:10:11.423
I can teach you to
get standing O's.


238
00:10:11.423 --> 00:10:12.223
Mm-hmm.

239
00:10:12.223 --> 00:10:13.023
You know what?

240
00:10:13.023 --> 00:10:15.433
Thank you, but I kind of
want to find my own way.


241
00:10:15.433 --> 00:10:16.723
Silly.

242
00:10:16.723 --> 00:10:18.763
Why don't you grab
a coffee with me?


243
00:10:18.763 --> 00:10:20.963
I mean, what-- what's the
worst that can happen?


244
00:10:20.963 --> 00:10:22.153
I got a cool car.

245
00:10:22.153 --> 00:10:23.413
Why don't you hop in?

246
00:10:23.413 --> 00:10:25.153
It is so cool.

247
00:10:25.153 --> 00:10:26.593
God.

248
00:10:26.593 --> 00:10:28.853
Maybe I could just sit
in it for a second.


249
00:10:28.853 --> 00:10:29.993
No, I can't do this.

250
00:10:29.993 --> 00:10:31.253
I got to go.
I got to sleep.


251
00:10:31.253 --> 00:10:32.053
I got to eat.

252
00:10:32.053 --> 00:10:34.033
I got a table read
tomorrow, Greggy.


253
00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:34.933
OK.

254
00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:36.913
Well, text me.

255
00:10:36.913 --> 00:10:37.843
All right.

256
00:10:37.843 --> 00:10:38.643
Bye, Greggy.

257
00:10:54.883 --> 00:10:57.031
I say we
do another musical, guys.


258
00:10:57.031 --> 00:10:57.831
Rawr!

259
00:10:57.831 --> 00:11:00.203
Rawr, rawr, rawr!

260
00:11:00.203 --> 00:11:02.731
Mama lion reporting
for den duty.


261
00:11:02.731 --> 00:11:03.773
Hey, twin.

262
00:11:03.773 --> 00:11:05.293
Check the lips.

263
00:11:05.293 --> 00:11:06.233
Hmm?

264
00:11:06.233 --> 00:11:08.663
Marjorie,
that's an exact match.


265
00:11:08.663 --> 00:11:09.533
That's crazy.

266
00:11:09.533 --> 00:11:11.273
It's not crazy.

267
00:11:11.273 --> 00:11:12.923
It's flattering.

268
00:11:12.923 --> 00:11:15.323
Anyhow, so by now
we've all read the script.


269
00:11:15.323 --> 00:11:17.963
We know it's about a small town.

270
00:11:17.963 --> 00:11:19.553
But what is it really about?

271
00:11:19.553 --> 00:11:21.053
It's
about all of us.


272
00:11:21.053 --> 00:11:22.676
Is it about Detroit?

273
00:11:22.676 --> 00:11:23.843
It's-- it's human.

274
00:11:23.843 --> 00:11:24.661
It's universal.

275
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:26.453
Come on,
the universal Southern


276
00:11:26.453 --> 00:11:28.578
experiences that we were--
that's what we're doing?


277
00:11:28.578 --> 00:11:31.673
Rain's coming in.

278
00:11:31.673 --> 00:11:32.523
What is rain?

279
00:11:32.523 --> 00:11:33.323
What is it?

280
00:11:33.323 --> 00:11:34.733
Rain, rain is water.

281
00:11:34.733 --> 00:11:35.533
It's viscous.

282
00:11:35.533 --> 00:11:37.113
It's molecular H2O.

283
00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:38.273
Mm-hmm.
Good.


284
00:11:38.273 --> 00:11:40.433
It cleanses
but also makes mud.


285
00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:42.593
Phones down, OK?

286
00:11:42.593 --> 00:11:45.443
Let's
open the damn script.


287
00:11:45.443 --> 00:11:49.043
Rain's Coming
In, written by Sam Clifford,


288
00:11:49.043 --> 00:11:51.713
directed by Sam Clifford!

289
00:11:54.707 --> 00:11:56.703
That's my girl.

290
00:11:56.703 --> 00:11:59.033
No relation
to me, Sheldon Clifford.


291
00:11:59.033 --> 00:12:00.423
Only met her mom once!

292
00:12:00.423 --> 00:12:01.713
I swear I did nothing.

293
00:12:01.713 --> 00:12:03.133
You fucked her mom?

294
00:12:03.133 --> 00:12:04.623
No.
Uh-oh.


295
00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:05.423
No.

296
00:12:05.423 --> 00:12:06.753
No, I did not.

297
00:12:06.753 --> 00:12:07.825
Here we go.

298
00:12:07.825 --> 00:12:08.973
Act 1.

299
00:12:08.973 --> 00:12:11.043
Mama Jean's rural home.

300
00:12:11.043 --> 00:12:13.713
Mama Jean enters
in robe smoking.


301
00:12:13.713 --> 00:12:16.753
Opens newspaper, smacks it.

302
00:12:16.753 --> 00:12:17.833
Humph!

303
00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:19.843
Thunder, lightning.

304
00:12:19.843 --> 00:12:20.993
Mama looks outside.

305
00:12:24.983 --> 00:12:27.043
Rain's coming in.

306
00:12:27.043 --> 00:12:29.263
It's raining
drops the size of gumballs.


307
00:12:32.623 --> 00:12:35.153
Cooper,
you got a hard heart.


308
00:12:35.153 --> 00:12:40.173
It ain't our fault you
drink to get through a day!


309
00:12:40.173 --> 00:12:44.963
I'm daddy, but
I'm a dead fucking ghost daddy.


310
00:12:48.983 --> 00:12:52.363
W-- why,
Cooper, you're drunk.


311
00:12:52.363 --> 00:12:53.863
You are too, mama.

312
00:12:53.863 --> 00:12:56.393
So don't you dare!

313
00:12:56.393 --> 00:12:58.468
No,
she ain't, Cooper!


314
00:12:58.468 --> 00:13:00.503
Lillie Mae,
mama's little lapdog!


315
00:13:03.713 --> 00:13:08.203
Now, listen, here,
if you love the wild, the wild


316
00:13:08.203 --> 00:13:09.533
love you back, boy.

317
00:13:09.533 --> 00:13:11.243
Dinner's
ready, potatoes


318
00:13:11.243 --> 00:13:13.133
whipped high like mountains.

319
00:13:13.133 --> 00:13:16.643
There's enough food here
to feed a firehouse.


320
00:13:16.643 --> 00:13:19.343
Mama, we ought to invite Buck.

321
00:13:19.343 --> 00:13:22.163
Lillie Mae's sweet on him.

322
00:13:22.163 --> 00:13:24.263
Lillie Mae
screams and collapses


323
00:13:24.263 --> 00:13:26.553
in the door, holding Buck.

324
00:13:26.553 --> 00:13:30.293
Oh, Buck, the
father of the unborn baby!


325
00:13:30.293 --> 00:13:36.743
Oh, God, this is worse
than porridge on ice!


326
00:13:36.743 --> 00:13:39.263
Yes, I'm pregnant, y'all.

327
00:13:39.263 --> 00:13:44.403
Lights dim,
rain sound, end of play.


328
00:13:44.403 --> 00:13:45.653
It's really good.

329
00:13:45.653 --> 00:13:46.853
Really sad, right?

330
00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:47.653
Sad story.

331
00:13:47.653 --> 00:13:48.986
Yeah, it was great.

332
00:13:48.986 --> 00:13:50.603
I'd just go a little
longer, chica.


333
00:13:50.603 --> 00:13:52.283
No, it was long.

334
00:13:52.283 --> 00:13:54.023
I think like a director.

335
00:13:54.023 --> 00:13:55.593
You
know, I love it.


336
00:13:55.593 --> 00:13:56.783
I'm obsessed with it.

337
00:13:56.783 --> 00:13:59.123
But there are three funerals.

338
00:13:59.123 --> 00:14:02.823
There are also 20
monologues back to back.


339
00:14:02.823 --> 00:14:05.813
Imagine-- imagine
fucking but you're


340
00:14:05.813 --> 00:14:08.713
climaxing the entire time.

341
00:14:08.713 --> 00:14:11.163
Don't
have to imagine.


342
00:14:11.163 --> 00:14:13.623
Corden,
your ghost character


343
00:14:13.623 --> 00:14:15.133
scared the shit out of me.

344
00:14:15.133 --> 00:14:17.631
And I say that as someone
who's been stabbed six times.


345
00:14:17.631 --> 00:14:19.173
By six
different people?


346
00:14:19.173 --> 00:14:20.006
Four.

347
00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:22.743
Should we focus, or
is this good for camaraderie?


348
00:14:22.743 --> 00:14:24.873
OK,
monstrous read, everybody.


349
00:14:24.873 --> 00:14:26.853
Just a little over three hours.

350
00:14:26.853 --> 00:14:28.113
Thank you, everyone.

351
00:14:28.113 --> 00:14:29.403
Beautiful work.

352
00:14:29.403 --> 00:14:33.603
Email me if you want to
meet for one-on-ones!


353
00:14:33.603 --> 00:14:35.223
- Well, that was amazing.
- It--


354
00:14:35.223 --> 00:14:36.661
It was.
It was.


355
00:14:36.661 --> 00:14:37.953
And did you see this?

356
00:14:37.953 --> 00:14:40.893
Glendale Post, "Sam
Clifford to direct.


357
00:14:40.893 --> 00:14:42.873
First-time female
director poised to helm


358
00:14:42.873 --> 00:14:44.173
show at the Regis Theater."

359
00:14:44.173 --> 00:14:45.543
Front page!

360
00:14:45.543 --> 00:14:47.769
Incredible.

361
00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:50.259
Ooh, la la la.

362
00:14:50.259 --> 00:14:52.603
Mm-hmm.

363
00:14:52.603 --> 00:14:53.403
Sam.

364
00:14:53.403 --> 00:14:55.213
Yeah.

365
00:14:55.213 --> 00:14:56.553
Hey.

366
00:14:56.553 --> 00:14:59.153
Just looking at this
little write-up that I got.


367
00:14:59.153 --> 00:15:00.483
Oh wow.
Congratulations.


368
00:15:00.483 --> 00:15:01.393
Thank you.

369
00:15:01.393 --> 00:15:04.053
I'm so excited
that you're getting to direct.


370
00:15:04.053 --> 00:15:05.283
I am too.

371
00:15:05.283 --> 00:15:06.825
The whole
time I've worked


372
00:15:06.825 --> 00:15:08.013
here, it's always been men.

373
00:15:08.013 --> 00:15:09.753
So just seeing you
walk through that door


374
00:15:09.753 --> 00:15:13.930
today in this new position
was really powerful.


375
00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:14.763
Thank you.

376
00:15:14.763 --> 00:15:15.850
I'm inspired.

377
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:16.683
Thank you.

378
00:15:16.683 --> 00:15:18.873
I've been trying
to do a little writing myself.


379
00:15:18.873 --> 00:15:19.673
Really?

380
00:15:19.673 --> 00:15:22.173
Yeah, but I'm
really visual and abstract.


381
00:15:22.173 --> 00:15:24.843
I'm-- I'm scared it
might be my downfall.


382
00:15:24.843 --> 00:15:28.793
Well, if I could
give you some advice, um,


383
00:15:28.793 --> 00:15:30.433
I would say have fun with it.

384
00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:31.873
Because if you're
not, they won't.


385
00:15:31.873 --> 00:15:35.353
Well, us two girls, we
got to stick together.


386
00:15:35.353 --> 00:15:37.511
That glass ceiling is no joke.

387
00:15:37.511 --> 00:15:39.553
Yeah, and my
glass ceiling is blocking


388
00:15:39.553 --> 00:15:41.143
me from getting up to yours.

389
00:15:41.143 --> 00:15:43.103
So--

390
00:15:43.903 --> 00:15:47.253
That part.

391
00:15:47.253 --> 00:15:50.223
Anyway, I got
to do a little work.


392
00:15:50.223 --> 00:15:51.098
All right.

393
00:16:04.533 --> 00:16:07.023
Today, I've
brought in some coaches


394
00:16:07.023 --> 00:16:10.203
from all over Glendale who
are going to help you think


395
00:16:10.203 --> 00:16:12.953
about how to refine your work.

396
00:16:12.953 --> 00:16:13.753
OK?

397
00:16:13.753 --> 00:16:18.193
What is acting?

398
00:16:18.193 --> 00:16:19.290
Rudie, where are you from?

399
00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:20.873
- Florida.
- OK, Rudie.


400
00:16:20.873 --> 00:16:22.493
I want this to come
out of your dick.


401
00:16:22.493 --> 00:16:25.433
I want you to really
just, like, say it.


402
00:16:25.433 --> 00:16:26.333
OK?

403
00:16:26.333 --> 00:16:28.223
- Florida!
- I'm from Florida!


404
00:16:28.223 --> 00:16:29.054
Can we get
another one out of you?


405
00:16:29.054 --> 00:16:30.743
That's my friend.
Let's get the whole shaft.


406
00:16:30.743 --> 00:16:32.363
- I'm from Florida!
- More.


407
00:16:32.363 --> 00:16:33.263
Put the balls in.

408
00:16:33.263 --> 00:16:34.471
I'm from Florida!

409
00:16:34.471 --> 00:16:35.703
Yes, yes!

410
00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:37.043
- Put your hands--
- From Iowa.


411
00:16:37.043 --> 00:16:38.376
I'm from Hollywood!

412
00:16:38.376 --> 00:16:40.643
You put
both titties in there!


413
00:16:40.643 --> 00:16:42.443
You're
fucking seals,


414
00:16:42.443 --> 00:16:44.693
just throwing little anchovies
out for you to catch.


415
00:16:44.693 --> 00:16:46.223
Ar, ar, ar, ar!

416
00:16:46.223 --> 00:16:47.663
Are you saying
that like a good thing or?


417
00:16:47.663 --> 00:16:49.471
No, I'm saying it
like that's what being an actor


418
00:16:49.471 --> 00:16:50.273
is.

419
00:16:50.273 --> 00:16:51.106
Uh-huh.

420
00:16:51.106 --> 00:16:53.053
Acting
is not something I do.


421
00:16:53.053 --> 00:16:54.263
I'm 28.

422
00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:56.903
You can definitely
play older or younger.


423
00:16:56.903 --> 00:16:58.133
How old are you?

424
00:16:58.133 --> 00:16:58.933
28.

425
00:17:01.363 --> 00:17:02.163
Yeah.

426
00:17:02.163 --> 00:17:03.538
I
also do training.


427
00:17:03.538 --> 00:17:05.763
I'm a trainer as well.

428
00:17:05.763 --> 00:17:06.878
Down, and back.

429
00:17:06.878 --> 00:17:08.921
You want us all
running at the same time?


430
00:17:08.921 --> 00:17:09.722
All
at the same time.


431
00:17:09.722 --> 00:17:10.523
Just
do what he says.


432
00:17:10.523 --> 00:17:12.483
Do you know
were Flappers Comedy Club is?


433
00:17:12.483 --> 00:17:13.285
Yes.

434
00:17:13.285 --> 00:17:14.733
I live in
one of the apartments


435
00:17:14.733 --> 00:17:15.543
right above that.

436
00:17:15.543 --> 00:17:16.442
Wow.

437
00:17:16.442 --> 00:17:18.317
How did
you get a place there?


438
00:17:18.317 --> 00:17:19.803
I do
stand-up comedy.


439
00:17:19.803 --> 00:17:20.603
Wait.

440
00:17:20.603 --> 00:17:23.942
So the rundown is you do
stand-up, personal training,


441
00:17:23.942 --> 00:17:25.143
- and acting coaching?
- Yes.


442
00:17:25.143 --> 00:17:25.952
What's
your bread-winner,


443
00:17:25.952 --> 00:17:26.994
though, out of the three?

444
00:17:26.994 --> 00:17:30.463
I make my most
money working at Squeakers.


445
00:17:30.463 --> 00:17:31.263
Hi.

446
00:17:33.893 --> 00:17:35.613
Say hi.

447
00:17:35.613 --> 00:17:36.443
OK, hi.

448
00:17:36.443 --> 00:17:37.443
Oh my God.

449
00:17:37.443 --> 00:17:40.273
Is World War III coming?

450
00:17:40.273 --> 00:17:41.253
Hi.

451
00:17:41.253 --> 00:17:43.413
See?

452
00:17:43.413 --> 00:17:44.330
So let's try it again.

453
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.288
Thank you.

454
00:17:45.288 --> 00:17:47.343
Because I really felt
like you really meant it.


455
00:17:47.343 --> 00:17:48.483
- It's different.
- I got chills.


456
00:17:48.483 --> 00:17:50.353
There
are differences.


457
00:17:50.353 --> 00:17:52.353
How do you
get out of your own head?


458
00:17:52.353 --> 00:17:55.353
I feel like so often
I'm my greatest block.


459
00:17:55.353 --> 00:17:57.411
I thought you
said, I migrate as block.


460
00:17:57.411 --> 00:17:58.953
That's
what I thought.


461
00:17:59.753 --> 00:18:01.983
I thought she
said, I migrate as block.


462
00:18:01.983 --> 00:18:03.633
OK,
and what if she did?


463
00:18:03.633 --> 00:18:05.703
What if she did?

464
00:18:05.703 --> 00:18:09.753
Everything is right except
for what you're feeling.


465
00:18:12.378 --> 00:18:13.178
Food.

466
00:18:16.603 --> 00:18:17.403
OK?

467
00:18:17.403 --> 00:18:23.133
If your character is not
eating, the heart's not beating.


468
00:18:23.133 --> 00:18:26.178
The-- the sound can come
out of your mouth, but--


469
00:18:26.178 --> 00:18:28.053
I didn't
even know you had that.


470
00:18:28.053 --> 00:18:29.428
Brad
Pitt has never


471
00:18:29.428 --> 00:18:31.928
said a line on or off camera
without something in his mouth.


472
00:18:32.728 --> 00:18:34.323
I just got chills.

473
00:18:34.323 --> 00:18:40.173
Denzel Washington
would not be Denzel Washington


474
00:18:40.173 --> 00:18:41.623
without a pocketful of peanuts.

475
00:18:41.623 --> 00:18:43.113
Always going.

476
00:18:43.113 --> 00:18:45.150
You can see his mouth going.

477
00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.233
Who are you waiting to be?

478
00:18:46.233 --> 00:18:49.643
You have a bathroom in
here on the premises?


479
00:18:49.643 --> 00:18:51.756
Yeah.

480
00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:52.581
How far?

481
00:18:53.383 --> 00:18:54.183
Get out.

482
00:18:54.183 --> 00:18:54.983
We don't know him.

483
00:18:54.983 --> 00:18:56.288
We don't know him.
Come on out.


484
00:18:56.288 --> 00:18:57.173
I'm
doing all right.


485
00:18:57.173 --> 00:18:58.283
We don't--

486
00:18:58.283 --> 00:18:59.700
It's
too much fruit.


487
00:19:13.758 --> 00:19:15.883
We were all
shocked you were directing.


488
00:19:15.883 --> 00:19:17.466
It felt
like time, you know?


489
00:19:17.466 --> 00:19:18.773
It felt right.

490
00:19:18.773 --> 00:19:20.603
Huge jump.

491
00:19:20.603 --> 00:19:25.423
I wanted to talk about
our vision for Cooper.


492
00:19:25.423 --> 00:19:27.403
- Do you see him as gay?
- Do you him to be?


493
00:19:27.403 --> 00:19:28.243
No.

494
00:19:28.243 --> 00:19:29.503
Well, I'm not mommy.

495
00:19:29.503 --> 00:19:32.033
What's your vision?

496
00:19:32.033 --> 00:19:33.323
Mommy?

497
00:19:33.323 --> 00:19:34.913
It's a funny word.

498
00:19:34.913 --> 00:19:36.983
Mine actually split
when I was six.


499
00:19:36.983 --> 00:19:40.763
A lot of the mama lion
thing you've been doing, um,


500
00:19:40.763 --> 00:19:41.903
it's just a lot for me.

501
00:19:41.903 --> 00:19:43.563
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, my God.


502
00:19:43.563 --> 00:19:45.173
- I did not know.
- No, stop.


503
00:19:45.173 --> 00:19:47.478
I went to a fun boarding
school and got over it fast.


504
00:19:47.478 --> 00:19:49.103
And, you know, I just
kind of realized,


505
00:19:49.103 --> 00:19:50.903
like, why am I
taking it so personal


506
00:19:50.903 --> 00:19:52.493
that my mom abandoned me?

507
00:19:52.493 --> 00:19:53.423
Right.

508
00:19:53.423 --> 00:19:55.313
Yeah, and, Rudie,
I hope you're not


509
00:19:55.313 --> 00:19:57.293
nervous about this production.

510
00:19:57.293 --> 00:19:59.573
I know it's
challenging material,


511
00:19:59.573 --> 00:20:03.323
but you're a super duper actor.

512
00:20:03.323 --> 00:20:05.213
And you're really great.

513
00:20:05.213 --> 00:20:06.953
You know that, right?

514
00:20:06.953 --> 00:20:09.833
Don't try
that greeky shit with me.


515
00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:11.633
It's not you.

516
00:20:11.633 --> 00:20:14.643
Anyway, thanks for
giving me free rein.


517
00:20:14.643 --> 00:20:15.443
Yeah.

518
00:20:19.783 --> 00:20:23.463
You know,
you seem scared.


519
00:20:23.463 --> 00:20:26.523
Sometimes the best thing
you can do is just admit it.


520
00:20:29.063 --> 00:20:31.733
People really respect honesty.

521
00:20:35.376 --> 00:20:36.294
Coffee?

522
00:20:36.294 --> 00:20:37.252
Oh, my god.

523
00:20:37.252 --> 00:20:38.573
Oh, it's too hot.

524
00:20:38.573 --> 00:20:40.603
It's too hot to--

525
00:20:40.603 --> 00:20:41.403
oh.

526
00:20:44.803 --> 00:20:45.603
Bye.

527
00:20:58.738 --> 00:20:59.983
So notecard 72--

528
00:20:59.983 --> 00:21:01.483
nope 71.

529
00:21:01.483 --> 00:21:02.593
Sorry about that.

530
00:21:02.593 --> 00:21:04.513
So this is Elizabeth Cary.

531
00:21:04.513 --> 00:21:06.523
To anyone who guessed,
that's correct.


532
00:21:06.523 --> 00:21:09.163
Elizabeth Cary, she
penned the first play


533
00:21:09.163 --> 00:21:11.683
written by a woman in 1613.

534
00:21:11.683 --> 00:21:14.263
She had 11 kids, and
she still created.


535
00:21:14.263 --> 00:21:15.463
That's grit.

536
00:21:15.463 --> 00:21:17.593
OK, I'm going to hang this.

537
00:21:17.593 --> 00:21:19.783
I'll get one of the
guys to hang it.


538
00:21:19.783 --> 00:21:22.263
We made it through
this many notecards.


539
00:21:22.263 --> 00:21:23.423
Corn on the cob.

540
00:21:23.423 --> 00:21:24.423
Nya-nya.

541
00:21:24.423 --> 00:21:28.803
You guys have been amazing to
just stick it out this long.


542
00:21:28.803 --> 00:21:33.163
And I want to admit
something to you.


543
00:21:33.163 --> 00:21:34.353
I'm scared right now.

544
00:21:34.353 --> 00:21:36.063
I was scared this
morning getting ready.


545
00:21:36.063 --> 00:21:39.183
I'm scared to lead.

546
00:21:39.183 --> 00:21:40.593
Sometimes it's good to say that.

547
00:21:45.693 --> 00:21:47.643
What?

548
00:21:47.643 --> 00:21:49.803
I'm doing
a panties giveaway.


549
00:21:49.803 --> 00:21:50.883
My panties, I wear them.

550
00:21:50.883 --> 00:21:52.593
- And then I give them away.
- Pantie?


551
00:21:52.593 --> 00:21:54.218
It's
like a sponsor thing.


552
00:21:54.218 --> 00:21:57.643
There's some shit on them,
so they sell for more.


553
00:21:57.643 --> 00:21:59.669
Not my shit.

554
00:22:01.545 --> 00:22:03.133
- My love?
- Yeah.


555
00:22:03.133 --> 00:22:05.713
My kid sister,
I mentioned her to you, right?


556
00:22:05.713 --> 00:22:06.913
She's a single mom?

557
00:22:06.913 --> 00:22:09.023
Yeah, she's having
some child care issue.


558
00:22:09.023 --> 00:22:10.043
Oh, no.

559
00:22:10.043 --> 00:22:10.876
Yeah.

560
00:22:10.876 --> 00:22:13.333
So I told her I'd
watch my niece.


561
00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:14.593
I mean, you get it?

562
00:22:14.593 --> 00:22:16.133
Single mom, child care issues?

563
00:22:16.133 --> 00:22:16.933
Yeah.

564
00:22:16.933 --> 00:22:18.853
I'm trying to think how
we could make it work.


565
00:22:18.853 --> 00:22:20.448
Maybe she could
sit off to the side


566
00:22:20.448 --> 00:22:21.823
and do her homework
or something?


567
00:22:21.823 --> 00:22:23.573
I don't know, but we
should talk about it.


568
00:22:23.573 --> 00:22:24.681
When is this?

569
00:22:24.681 --> 00:22:25.723
Right now.

570
00:22:25.723 --> 00:22:28.123
Come on in, honey.

571
00:22:28.123 --> 00:22:30.615
She-- she said you have
to sit in the corner.


572
00:22:31.417 --> 00:22:33.493
No, I'm saying
like, I just feel like then


573
00:22:33.493 --> 00:22:35.443
you'd have your own space.

574
00:22:35.443 --> 00:22:39.081
Yeah, you can grab that chair.

575
00:22:58.723 --> 00:23:00.600
She seems so sad.

576
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.533
- Unforgivable.
- It's hard to see.


577
00:23:02.533 --> 00:23:03.333
Welcome.

578
00:23:05.853 --> 00:23:08.085
So--

579
00:23:09.913 --> 00:23:11.173
My boy Zac.

580
00:23:11.173 --> 00:23:12.643
What's up?

581
00:23:12.643 --> 00:23:14.983
Yeah, hey, Efron, baby.

582
00:23:14.983 --> 00:23:16.408
What's up, brother?

583
00:23:16.408 --> 00:23:18.033
Wait
are-- are you serious?


584
00:23:18.033 --> 00:23:19.493
It's actually Zac Efron?

585
00:23:19.493 --> 00:23:21.035
Yeah,
you little bitch.


586
00:23:21.035 --> 00:23:21.943
What up?

587
00:23:21.943 --> 00:23:23.893
Now we got
rid of him, we can get


588
00:23:23.893 --> 00:23:26.743
to the infamous notecard 72.

589
00:23:26.743 --> 00:23:27.693
What's the diaphragm?

590
00:23:27.693 --> 00:23:28.493
Where is it?

591
00:23:28.493 --> 00:23:29.683
You know, I'm going
to take over because I think


592
00:23:29.683 --> 00:23:30.893
you're going to confuse them.

593
00:23:30.893 --> 00:23:34.746
And it's better if I
just, like, read this one.


594
00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:36.913
Um, it's just an area that
I have a lot of expertise


595
00:23:36.913 --> 00:23:39.455
and passion around, which is
the diaphragm, which is actually


596
00:23:39.455 --> 00:23:41.330
connected to the pelvic floor.

597
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.902
So if you have a
scrotum, for example,


598
00:23:42.902 --> 00:23:43.704
tighten that, kind of--

599
00:23:43.704 --> 00:23:44.863
OK,
there's a kid, just


600
00:23:44.863 --> 00:23:45.748
reminding you, the scrotum.

601
00:23:45.748 --> 00:23:46.693
Oh,
I'm fine with that.


602
00:23:46.693 --> 00:23:48.763
It's good to not attach
shame to those words.


603
00:23:48.763 --> 00:23:50.683
Let it spread around the anus.

604
00:23:50.683 --> 00:23:52.573
Interesting choice for director.

605
00:23:52.573 --> 00:23:54.343
I'm all for a woman
in charge, completely.


606
00:23:54.343 --> 00:23:56.773
But like, kind of please
be a different one.


607
00:23:56.773 --> 00:23:57.573
Please.

608
00:23:57.573 --> 00:23:58.948
At
least a woman that


609
00:23:58.948 --> 00:24:00.311
won't let Marjorie's niece just
barge into the rehearsal space.


610
00:24:00.311 --> 00:24:01.111
That was insane.

611
00:24:01.911 --> 00:24:02.711
That was crazy.

612
00:24:02.711 --> 00:24:03.513
Wait.

613
00:24:03.513 --> 00:24:04.993
Who am I?

614
00:24:04.993 --> 00:24:07.153
Hoo, hoo.

615
00:24:07.153 --> 00:24:09.258
Scared Samantha.

616
00:24:09.258 --> 00:24:10.758
Oh, I
just dislike her.


617
00:24:10.758 --> 00:24:13.338
Look at these notecards!

618
00:24:13.338 --> 00:24:14.463
My name is Sam.

619
00:24:14.463 --> 00:24:16.303
I have a lot riding on this.

620
00:24:16.303 --> 00:24:19.361
I hope I get a big, fancy--

621
00:24:19.361 --> 00:24:20.653
Wait, what is that?

622
00:24:22.963 --> 00:24:24.573
Where
are you looking?


623
00:24:24.573 --> 00:24:26.323
Oh.

624
00:24:26.323 --> 00:24:27.495
Hey, guys.

625
00:24:27.495 --> 00:24:29.163
Hey.

626
00:24:29.163 --> 00:24:30.981
Great rehearsal today.
Great job.


627
00:24:30.981 --> 00:24:31.898
Thank you.

628
00:24:31.898 --> 00:24:34.353
It was amazing.

629
00:24:34.353 --> 00:24:36.123
Just
waiting for a Zoomer.


630
00:24:36.123 --> 00:24:37.373
Yeah.

631
00:24:37.373 --> 00:24:40.403
I'm just
going to Zoom on out.


632
00:24:42.758 --> 00:24:43.633
Bye, Clara.

633
00:24:43.633 --> 00:24:44.433
Bye.

634
00:24:48.226 --> 00:24:49.143
Hey, Corden.

635
00:24:49.143 --> 00:24:50.268
Yeah, see you.

636
00:24:55.013 --> 00:24:56.503
- Hey.
- Hey.


637
00:24:56.503 --> 00:24:58.295
You have a
good first rehearsal?


638
00:24:58.295 --> 00:24:59.823
Yeah, it
was really good.


639
00:24:59.823 --> 00:25:01.723
It was so good today.

640
00:25:01.723 --> 00:25:02.813
- OK.
- Bye.


641
00:25:02.813 --> 00:25:03.855
See you later.

642
00:25:17.189 --> 00:25:19.393
Whoa,
a hand-drawn map.


643
00:25:19.393 --> 00:25:21.853
"Hey, let's meet
at Griffith Park.


644
00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:23.045
Fun rehearsal time."

645
00:25:23.045 --> 00:25:24.253
I know the spot.

646
00:25:24.253 --> 00:25:25.873
Follow me.

647
00:25:25.873 --> 00:25:27.608
Come on.

648
00:25:27.608 --> 00:25:29.233
Yeah,
I'll catch up later.


649
00:25:29.233 --> 00:25:30.275
I'll meet you guys there.

650
00:25:30.275 --> 00:25:32.353
I just got to go
get a couple Jamocha


651
00:25:32.353 --> 00:25:33.417
shakes for me and my mom.

652
00:25:33.417 --> 00:25:34.217
Be really
disappointing if you


653
00:25:34.217 --> 00:25:35.017
didn't come.

654
00:25:35.017 --> 00:25:35.817
Be really disappointing
if you didn't.


655
00:25:35.817 --> 00:25:36.793
Oh my God.

656
00:25:36.793 --> 00:25:38.263
My doctor.

657
00:25:38.263 --> 00:25:39.924
I have it.

658
00:26:03.533 --> 00:26:06.203
Hey, hey.

659
00:26:06.203 --> 00:26:09.293
Hello, thespians.

660
00:26:09.293 --> 00:26:10.373
Hi.

661
00:26:10.373 --> 00:26:12.263
Just squatting
on this old tree


662
00:26:12.263 --> 00:26:15.566
stump, communing with nature,
practicing my bird call.


663
00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:24.833
You're not dealing with that
uptight robot Sam Bird anymore.


664
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:26.583
I had an epiphany.

665
00:26:26.583 --> 00:26:27.923
I got to loosen up.

666
00:26:27.923 --> 00:26:30.353
So let's loosen up!

667
00:26:30.353 --> 00:26:31.503
Woo!

668
00:26:31.503 --> 00:26:32.303
So let's hike.

669
00:26:32.303 --> 00:26:33.483
Oh!

670
00:26:33.483 --> 00:26:34.343
Ah.

671
00:26:34.343 --> 00:26:35.993
So let's hike and--

672
00:26:35.993 --> 00:26:36.893
ooh.

673
00:26:36.893 --> 00:26:37.693
Got me.

674
00:26:37.693 --> 00:26:40.971
So let's hike and shout
lines into the wind.


675
00:26:40.971 --> 00:26:42.298
I didn't
bring my hiking shoes.


676
00:26:42.298 --> 00:26:43.100
Me neither.

677
00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.823
Well, we weren't
born in shoes, were we?


678
00:26:46.823 --> 00:26:49.583
So Davina,
like, totally bailed.


679
00:26:49.583 --> 00:26:50.546
And where's Corden?

680
00:26:50.546 --> 00:26:52.463
Ooh, I do have
a little announcement


681
00:26:52.463 --> 00:26:53.573
on that front.

682
00:26:53.573 --> 00:26:55.903
Corden landed a role in
the Magic Mike prequel.


683
00:26:55.903 --> 00:26:57.413
- Oh.
- He got out.


684
00:26:57.413 --> 00:26:58.913
So we're
completely fucked.


685
00:26:58.913 --> 00:26:59.871
Do not worry.

686
00:26:59.871 --> 00:27:04.163
He has given me his word, he
will be back for previews.


687
00:27:04.163 --> 00:27:06.477
Woo!

688
00:27:06.477 --> 00:27:07.578
Yes!

689
00:27:07.578 --> 00:27:09.865
Sam, is the
trail at least short?


690
00:27:09.865 --> 00:27:11.323
The
trail is not short.


691
00:27:11.323 --> 00:27:12.441
It's very steep and rigorous.

692
00:27:13.243 --> 00:27:14.503
What do you mean?

693
00:27:14.503 --> 00:27:16.423
I'll wait for you.

694
00:27:16.423 --> 00:27:22.508
My
shoes are made of felt.


695
00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:25.223
Everyone's
accents could improve,


696
00:27:25.223 --> 00:27:26.953
so let's really try to watch--

697
00:27:26.953 --> 00:27:30.472
I don't know-- old Southern
movies or something.


698
00:27:35.523 --> 00:27:36.805
Sam, Sam, Sam.

699
00:27:36.805 --> 00:27:40.125
You know I respect
your vision, but what--


700
00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:42.083
what the hell does this
have to do with acting?


701
00:27:42.083 --> 00:27:42.893
I'm just confused.

702
00:27:42.893 --> 00:27:45.323
I want to understand.

703
00:27:45.323 --> 00:27:48.008
You'll understand as
it goes deeper in your soul.


704
00:27:52.583 --> 00:27:54.743
Simon DiCaprio, hit us.

705
00:27:54.743 --> 00:27:59.498
I bought
poison from the apothecary.


706
00:27:59.498 --> 00:28:00.303
Ow!

707
00:28:00.303 --> 00:28:01.656
I hurt my damn ankle.

708
00:28:01.656 --> 00:28:02.823
Are you all right?

709
00:28:04.238 --> 00:28:05.038
Oh.

710
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:08.501
Why
are we even here?


711
00:28:08.501 --> 00:28:09.302
Don't worry.

712
00:28:09.302 --> 00:28:11.173
I'm going to just cock
that shit right back in--


713
00:28:11.173 --> 00:28:13.673
Wait, wait, wait.

714
00:28:13.673 --> 00:28:17.303
My ankle is double-jointed.

715
00:28:17.303 --> 00:28:18.603
What's new is the scratch.

716
00:28:21.083 --> 00:28:21.883
Oh.

717
00:28:21.883 --> 00:28:24.083
Come on.

718
00:28:24.083 --> 00:28:24.883
Oh.

719
00:28:47.711 --> 00:28:50.933
Home
again, home again, jiggity jig.


720
00:28:50.933 --> 00:28:52.153
All right, we're back.

721
00:28:52.153 --> 00:28:54.403
And it's rain day.

722
00:28:54.403 --> 00:28:57.133
Rain, rain, don't go away.

723
00:28:57.133 --> 00:28:58.230
Is the rain rig ready?

724
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:59.563
Oh, you betcha.

725
00:28:59.563 --> 00:29:01.003
- Should I fire it up?
- One second.


726
00:29:01.003 --> 00:29:02.053
Joseph.

727
00:29:02.053 --> 00:29:03.733
It's-- it's time
to run the rain.


728
00:29:03.733 --> 00:29:05.803
Joseph, we're going
to do the rain.


729
00:29:05.803 --> 00:29:07.543
You have earplugs
in or something?


730
00:29:07.543 --> 00:29:09.163
Earbuds.

731
00:29:09.163 --> 00:29:11.443
I listen to music
while I make kill lists


732
00:29:11.443 --> 00:29:14.583
of people I want fucking dead.

733
00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:16.543
All right, Joseph.

734
00:29:16.543 --> 00:29:17.343
All right.

735
00:29:17.343 --> 00:29:20.073
Well, it's the
gray, dreary morning


736
00:29:20.073 --> 00:29:22.023
of grandpappy's funeral.

737
00:29:22.023 --> 00:29:24.033
And here he lays, right?

738
00:29:24.033 --> 00:29:25.293
Here lays grandpappy.

739
00:29:25.293 --> 00:29:26.553
The rain is going to come on.

740
00:29:26.553 --> 00:29:27.453
You will get wet.

741
00:29:27.453 --> 00:29:30.423
There's plenty of towels
over here for after.


742
00:29:30.423 --> 00:29:31.683
I brought a bunch of props.

743
00:29:31.683 --> 00:29:33.133
Come on up and grab some.

744
00:29:33.133 --> 00:29:33.933
Whoa!

745
00:29:33.933 --> 00:29:34.733
We got a hat.

746
00:29:34.733 --> 00:29:35.563
We got an umbrella.

747
00:29:35.563 --> 00:29:36.363
We got a poncho.

748
00:29:36.363 --> 00:29:38.893
We got a something.

749
00:29:38.893 --> 00:29:39.693
Have at it.

750
00:29:39.693 --> 00:29:40.495
I'm
going to go ahead


751
00:29:40.495 --> 00:29:42.266
and snatch this little
rainslicker right here.


752
00:29:42.266 --> 00:29:43.683
I'll
take the flowers.


753
00:29:43.683 --> 00:29:46.958
I'll
take the umbrella.


754
00:29:46.958 --> 00:29:48.978
That's actually
bad luck, Macbeth.


755
00:29:50.193 --> 00:29:52.096
Macbeth, Macbeth!

756
00:29:52.096 --> 00:29:53.013
Oh, great.

757
00:29:53.013 --> 00:29:54.453
Well, I'll just use this--
something that my character


758
00:29:54.453 --> 00:29:55.595
would absolutely never wear.

759
00:29:56.397 --> 00:29:57.243
- Cute.
- It's cute.


760
00:29:57.243 --> 00:29:58.326
This isn't even bad taste.

761
00:29:58.326 --> 00:29:59.823
It's the complete
absence of taste.


762
00:29:59.823 --> 00:30:01.693
Clara, that's
actually hurting my feelings.


763
00:30:01.693 --> 00:30:03.568
That my personal hat
that I brought from home


764
00:30:03.568 --> 00:30:04.833
to share with you guys.

765
00:30:04.833 --> 00:30:08.373
It's neither
here nor there, Sam.


766
00:30:08.373 --> 00:30:09.723
Oh, come on.

767
00:30:09.723 --> 00:30:12.093
These kids don't know style.

768
00:30:12.093 --> 00:30:14.433
We're in our brew.

769
00:30:14.433 --> 00:30:17.828
Oh, mama, mama, mama, mama.

770
00:30:17.828 --> 00:30:19.953
Kind of taste
what you had for breakfast.


771
00:30:19.953 --> 00:30:20.753
All right.

772
00:30:20.753 --> 00:30:22.503
Yeah, we better get going.

773
00:30:22.503 --> 00:30:24.543
Let's get into the piece, OK?

774
00:30:24.543 --> 00:30:26.653
Let's see what we got here.

775
00:30:26.653 --> 00:30:27.453
All right.

776
00:30:27.453 --> 00:30:28.413
So you're sad.

777
00:30:28.413 --> 00:30:29.713
You're at a funeral.

778
00:30:29.713 --> 00:30:30.513
You're sad.

779
00:30:30.513 --> 00:30:31.803
Everyone's feeling down.

780
00:30:31.803 --> 00:30:34.053
Grandpappy is gone.

781
00:30:34.053 --> 00:30:36.123
Davina, remember you're sad?

782
00:30:36.123 --> 00:30:37.113
Yeah.

783
00:30:37.113 --> 00:30:38.433
He's dead, right?

784
00:30:38.433 --> 00:30:39.983
So grandpappy, no!

785
00:30:39.983 --> 00:30:42.483
Grandpappy, no!

786
00:30:42.483 --> 00:30:44.523
All right,
we'll take it.


787
00:30:44.523 --> 00:30:47.483
Grandpappy
is my grandpappy, right?


788
00:30:47.483 --> 00:30:48.983
Oh, no, no.

789
00:30:48.983 --> 00:30:51.963
Your grandpappy would have died
a long, long, long, long time


790
00:30:51.963 --> 00:30:52.763
ago.

791
00:30:52.763 --> 00:30:55.853
No, but I'm
playing mama like 34, 35.


792
00:30:55.853 --> 00:30:58.073
She's
going to be high 60s


793
00:30:58.073 --> 00:31:03.743
and early 70s at the very, very
youngest, I'm going to say.


794
00:31:03.743 --> 00:31:05.358
Yeah.

795
00:31:05.358 --> 00:31:07.358
All right, guys,
Marjorie, lead us in.


796
00:31:07.358 --> 00:31:08.158
Woo!

797
00:31:08.158 --> 00:31:09.233
OK.

798
00:31:09.233 --> 00:31:14.943
Sky's darkening,
clouds getting heavy.


799
00:31:14.943 --> 00:31:21.813
We best say our final goodbyes
to dear old grandpappy,


800
00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:27.413
lest we get caught in
a hard, driving rain.


801
00:31:28.695 --> 00:31:29.653
Grandpappy!

802
00:31:29.653 --> 00:31:30.486
Oh, no.

803
00:31:30.486 --> 00:31:31.528
We're so sad.

804
00:31:32.403 --> 00:31:33.653
Dead and gone.

805
00:31:35.958 --> 00:31:38.463
Is it
raining way too hard?


806
00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:39.963
Turn it down, Sam!

807
00:31:39.963 --> 00:31:40.988
OK.

808
00:31:40.988 --> 00:31:42.363
We
look like a joke!


809
00:31:46.126 --> 00:31:47.668
It's
a hot, hot house.


810
00:31:52.249 --> 00:31:54.291
This is supposed
to be extremely hot.


811
00:31:58.549 --> 00:32:01.253
I'm swimming.

812
00:32:01.253 --> 00:32:04.904
Why is there so much rain?

813
00:32:04.904 --> 00:32:06.796
I'm sorry!

814
00:32:08.688 --> 00:32:12.243
The rain is
most definitely coming in.


815
00:32:12.243 --> 00:32:13.243
Ah!

816
00:32:26.623 --> 00:32:29.063
The Regis
is wet, wet, wetter.


817
00:32:29.063 --> 00:32:32.613
We don't care over here
about climate change, honey.


818
00:32:32.613 --> 00:32:35.715
We're doing a wet
t-shirt contest, dude.


819
00:32:35.715 --> 00:32:38.093
Davina, knock it off!

820
00:32:38.093 --> 00:32:41.848
Wet t-shirt,
wet t-shirt contest.


821
00:32:41.848 --> 00:32:43.207
My boobies are so wet!

822
00:32:43.207 --> 00:32:45.193
Stop showing
your chest, please!


823
00:32:45.193 --> 00:32:47.363
You're
slut-shaming them!


824
00:32:47.363 --> 00:32:50.763
What is going on?

825
00:32:50.763 --> 00:32:53.703
Hey, a little
water experiment setback.


826
00:32:53.703 --> 00:32:56.223
Sam, cast,
I'd like you to meet


827
00:32:56.223 --> 00:32:58.083
Miles and Thimberly Paris.

828
00:32:58.083 --> 00:33:00.673
They are very generous
donors to our little theater.


829
00:33:00.673 --> 00:33:02.163
Oh, well,
what an honor.


830
00:33:02.163 --> 00:33:04.068
Thank you.

831
00:33:04.068 --> 00:33:05.384
We love the Regis.

832
00:33:06.186 --> 00:33:07.228
You're kind.

833
00:33:07.228 --> 00:33:08.823
And I
put my money where


834
00:33:08.823 --> 00:33:10.400
my mouth is with the arts.

835
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.358
Here, here.

836
00:33:11.358 --> 00:33:13.593
It
makes me feel better


837
00:33:13.593 --> 00:33:15.993
about my undeserved wealth.

838
00:33:15.993 --> 00:33:17.703
Well, I love to stand
right here with all


839
00:33:17.703 --> 00:33:21.963
of you actors, theater
people, here in the green room


840
00:33:21.963 --> 00:33:22.893
together.

841
00:33:22.893 --> 00:33:24.133
Well, it's-- it's energizing.

842
00:33:24.133 --> 00:33:25.383
This is the green room, right?

843
00:33:25.383 --> 00:33:26.673
I'm saying that right?

844
00:33:26.673 --> 00:33:29.048
Well, technically,
it's known as the house.


845
00:33:29.048 --> 00:33:29.853
Ah.

846
00:33:29.853 --> 00:33:31.263
What a letdown.

847
00:33:31.263 --> 00:33:33.101
But it
is like a green room.


848
00:33:33.101 --> 00:33:34.143
It really is.

849
00:33:34.143 --> 00:33:35.093
Is it?

850
00:33:35.093 --> 00:33:36.093
It isn't.

851
00:33:36.093 --> 00:33:36.893
No?

852
00:33:36.893 --> 00:33:39.363
I have
a friend in textiles


853
00:33:39.363 --> 00:33:42.483
who would love her
fabric, Alabama jazz,


854
00:33:42.483 --> 00:33:44.313
to be incorporated into the set.

855
00:33:44.313 --> 00:33:45.415
Oh!

856
00:33:46.771 --> 00:33:48.963
But after
today, I don't know.


857
00:33:48.963 --> 00:33:51.003
Isn't
that fabric exquisite?


858
00:33:51.003 --> 00:33:52.413
- Stunning.
- All right.


859
00:33:52.413 --> 00:33:56.171
Well, we'll get out
of your wet hair.


860
00:34:00.653 --> 00:34:01.953
- Hey.
- Hey.


861
00:34:01.953 --> 00:34:02.913
Hey, are you OK?

862
00:34:02.913 --> 00:34:04.463
Yeah.

863
00:34:04.463 --> 00:34:05.823
Um, I'm good.

864
00:34:05.823 --> 00:34:06.933
Yeah.

865
00:34:06.933 --> 00:34:10.322
It's a little harder than I
thought, but it's been good.


866
00:34:10.322 --> 00:34:11.230
OK.

867
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:13.563
Yeah, see, I've been struggling
to get this play I wrote


868
00:34:13.563 --> 00:34:15.242
produced, so it's kind of
comforting to know it's


869
00:34:15.242 --> 00:34:16.443
no cakewalk for you either.

870
00:34:16.443 --> 00:34:18.163
No, there's
like hot coals.


871
00:34:18.163 --> 00:34:19.393
My feet are burnt.
Ow.


872
00:34:19.393 --> 00:34:20.193
Blisters.

873
00:34:20.193 --> 00:34:20.993
Oh.

874
00:34:20.993 --> 00:34:22.252
And I'm treading on--

875
00:34:22.252 --> 00:34:23.072
Sam?

876
00:34:23.072 --> 00:34:23.951
Yeah.

877
00:34:23.951 --> 00:34:25.159
Can I grab you?

878
00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:26.012
Uh-huh.

879
00:34:26.012 --> 00:34:27.813
All right.

880
00:34:27.813 --> 00:34:30.663
You are
alarmingly behind schedule.


881
00:34:30.663 --> 00:34:32.883
And I bit my tongue when
you harbored a minor


882
00:34:32.883 --> 00:34:34.623
and when you held
rehearsal in a tree,


883
00:34:34.623 --> 00:34:37.303
but this water
debacle was wretched.


884
00:34:37.303 --> 00:34:38.103
It's bad.

885
00:34:38.103 --> 00:34:38.903
Yeah.

886
00:34:38.903 --> 00:34:40.742
Would it help if
I sat in the room?


887
00:34:40.742 --> 00:34:43.143
I mean, it's tricky because
I want you to be yourself.


888
00:34:43.143 --> 00:34:47.703
But the blueprint for
what works here is Greggy.


889
00:34:47.703 --> 00:34:50.282
You know, he could go
mad dog if he needed to


890
00:34:50.282 --> 00:34:52.395
or-- or morph into
a trusted friend.


891
00:34:52.395 --> 00:34:54.426
Yeah, he was always
flipping out on people.


892
00:34:54.426 --> 00:34:55.228
Yeah.

893
00:34:55.228 --> 00:34:56.463
And then, like,
really weird and intimate.


894
00:34:56.463 --> 00:34:57.513
- Yeah.
- I'll try that.


895
00:34:57.513 --> 00:35:00.033
You do not have to sit
in rehearsals, my friend.


896
00:35:00.033 --> 00:35:02.953
I am excellent at
reading people.


897
00:35:02.953 --> 00:35:03.753
Trust me.

898
00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:14.885
Morning, Sam.

899
00:35:17.803 --> 00:35:20.423
Davina, are you
going to post about the show?


900
00:35:20.423 --> 00:35:21.829
No.

901
00:35:36.725 --> 00:35:38.725
Good morning.

902
00:35:39.803 --> 00:35:40.783
Hey.

903
00:35:40.783 --> 00:35:43.875
Clara, how's your mom?

904
00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:44.833
She's good.

905
00:35:44.833 --> 00:35:47.083
Miss that old girl.

906
00:35:47.083 --> 00:35:49.213
Marjorie, you look cool today!

907
00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:50.333
Oh, thanks.

908
00:35:50.333 --> 00:35:51.133
Want this jacket?

909
00:35:51.133 --> 00:35:52.963
I don't,
but thank you so much.


910
00:35:52.963 --> 00:35:54.043
That's so generous.

911
00:35:54.043 --> 00:35:55.093
Right off your back.

912
00:35:55.093 --> 00:35:56.803
Uh, who else we got in here?

913
00:35:56.803 --> 00:35:58.583
Davina!

914
00:35:58.583 --> 00:36:00.153
Rocking a cool new headband.

915
00:36:00.153 --> 00:36:01.553
- I like it.
- Thank you, girl.


916
00:36:01.553 --> 00:36:03.803
I got it from a company
in exchange for a post.


917
00:36:03.803 --> 00:36:08.243
Exciting
creative relationship!


918
00:36:11.063 --> 00:36:13.283
Simon's over there
nursing a coffee


919
00:36:13.283 --> 00:36:14.433
like it's his best friend.

920
00:36:14.433 --> 00:36:15.233
Mm-hmm.

921
00:36:15.233 --> 00:36:16.650
What's
your go-to order?


922
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.603
What is it?

923
00:36:17.603 --> 00:36:19.232
I usually
like an Americano


924
00:36:19.232 --> 00:36:20.034
with some agave in it.

925
00:36:20.034 --> 00:36:21.653
All right,
enough chit-chat!


926
00:36:21.653 --> 00:36:22.688
Everybody down!

927
00:36:27.138 --> 00:36:27.938
Sam!

928
00:36:27.938 --> 00:36:31.013
Have we replaced a male
predator with a female disaster?


929
00:36:31.013 --> 00:36:32.763
That's
a false equivalency!


930
00:36:32.763 --> 00:36:36.371
Learn your blocking!

931
00:36:36.371 --> 00:36:37.413
Knock it off.

932
00:36:37.413 --> 00:36:39.955
You're making us
all really uncomfortable, girl.


933
00:36:39.955 --> 00:36:41.303
Is this uncomfortable?

934
00:36:41.303 --> 00:36:42.723
Ka-blam!

935
00:36:42.723 --> 00:36:43.523
Yeah.

936
00:36:43.523 --> 00:36:45.023
You shot her.

937
00:36:45.023 --> 00:36:46.553
Blocking charts.

938
00:36:46.553 --> 00:36:47.688
Ever heard of them?

939
00:36:47.688 --> 00:36:49.324
You're going to want
to memorize those.


940
00:36:49.324 --> 00:36:50.126
Throwing shit at us?

941
00:36:50.126 --> 00:36:52.013
That'll help you
know where you're standing.


942
00:36:52.013 --> 00:36:54.430
Yeah, I don't
know how we memorize a picture.


943
00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:59.903
XTR to US of table?

944
00:36:59.903 --> 00:37:03.413
Cross down
right to upstage of table.


945
00:37:03.413 --> 00:37:06.421
Clara, so
there is a little brain


946
00:37:06.421 --> 00:37:07.463
knocking around in there.

947
00:37:07.463 --> 00:37:09.653
Ping, pong, poom, pom, poom pop.

948
00:37:09.653 --> 00:37:10.673
Good.

949
00:37:10.673 --> 00:37:11.753
Wow.

950
00:37:11.753 --> 00:37:13.583
We cue to cue in 20!

951
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:16.653
- Thank you, 20.
- I'm taking a shit.


952
00:37:16.653 --> 00:37:17.533
I'm not dealing with this.

953
00:37:17.533 --> 00:37:18.633
I have
a medical migraine.


954
00:37:18.633 --> 00:37:20.008
She
was provoking me.


955
00:37:20.008 --> 00:37:21.827
Sam is out
of her goddamn mind.


956
00:37:23.219 --> 00:37:25.813
Stay in the room!

957
00:37:25.813 --> 00:37:27.543
The doors are locked.

958
00:37:27.543 --> 00:37:29.293
Everybody
learn your lines,


959
00:37:29.293 --> 00:37:30.253
your lines and blocking.

960
00:37:30.253 --> 00:37:32.033
If you would have gotten
that, then none of this


961
00:37:32.033 --> 00:37:33.075
ever would have happened!

962
00:38:01.068 --> 00:38:02.443
How's
everyone feeling?


963
00:38:02.443 --> 00:38:05.183
You've been working
pretty hard out here.


964
00:38:05.183 --> 00:38:06.013
I appreciate it.

965
00:38:06.013 --> 00:38:08.235
Does anyone need anything,
a cup of tea or something?


966
00:38:09.035 --> 00:38:10.273
No.

967
00:38:10.273 --> 00:38:11.353
No?

968
00:38:11.353 --> 00:38:12.613
Everyone know all your marks?

969
00:38:12.613 --> 00:38:15.803
You feel good, feel solid?

970
00:38:15.803 --> 00:38:17.423
No one's talking to me?

971
00:38:17.423 --> 00:38:18.263
Let's play ball.

972
00:38:18.263 --> 00:38:19.568
Let's run it.

973
00:38:19.568 --> 00:38:20.783
Oh my god.

974
00:38:20.783 --> 00:38:21.953
Hey, wait.

975
00:38:21.953 --> 00:38:23.097
You're supposed to
take it off on me.


976
00:38:23.097 --> 00:38:23.899
You
got to scoot back.


977
00:38:23.899 --> 00:38:25.313
You got to scoot back.

978
00:38:25.313 --> 00:38:27.083
Houston,
we have a problem.


979
00:38:27.083 --> 00:38:27.938
Very out of sync.

980
00:38:27.938 --> 00:38:30.933
You guys are improving like
LA traffic is improving.


981
00:38:30.933 --> 00:38:31.733
It ain't.

982
00:38:31.733 --> 00:38:32.563
It's very wooden.

983
00:38:32.563 --> 00:38:33.563
Where's the camaraderie?

984
00:38:33.563 --> 00:38:34.605
Have you ever met before?

985
00:38:34.605 --> 00:38:35.563
Do you know each other?

986
00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:36.713
Just stop, OK?

987
00:38:36.713 --> 00:38:38.283
We're not robots!

988
00:38:38.283 --> 00:38:40.253
We're a bunch of people,
just kind of hanging


989
00:38:40.253 --> 00:38:41.753
out and living our lives.

990
00:38:41.753 --> 00:38:45.053
You know, doing what humans
do, having millions of feelings


991
00:38:45.053 --> 00:38:46.613
like little tea
candles, which you're


992
00:38:46.613 --> 00:38:48.443
snuffing out every single one.

993
00:38:48.443 --> 00:38:49.523
You want us to create?

994
00:38:49.523 --> 00:38:51.563
You want us to protect our fire?

995
00:38:51.563 --> 00:38:53.993
We cannot because of you!

996
00:38:53.993 --> 00:38:56.453
So why don't you stop
being fake nice to us


997
00:38:56.453 --> 00:38:57.803
and then yelling at us?

998
00:38:57.803 --> 00:38:59.003
Boom, dude!

999
00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:01.283
Come on, get a lifestyle.

1000
00:39:01.283 --> 00:39:03.131
It's ridiculous, Sam!

1001
00:39:04.067 --> 00:39:05.993
All right, what
are you doing right now?


1002
00:39:05.993 --> 00:39:06.793
I'm sorry.

1003
00:39:06.793 --> 00:39:08.273
Are you filming yourself crying?

1004
00:39:08.273 --> 00:39:09.383
Yeah,
people do that now.


1005
00:39:09.383 --> 00:39:11.591
They film themselves, like,
crying or at the hospital


1006
00:39:11.591 --> 00:39:13.013
and then post with
no explanation.


1007
00:39:13.013 --> 00:39:14.680
You
should put a filter on.


1008
00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.953
Oh my god!

1009
00:39:16.953 --> 00:39:18.803
This
is our craft, Sam.


1010
00:39:18.803 --> 00:39:19.643
It's kind
of a bummer, dude.


1011
00:39:19.643 --> 00:39:21.161
This feel like we
work at, like, Amazon.


1012
00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:21.961
Amazon?
Simon?


1013
00:39:21.961 --> 00:39:22.761
Really?

1014
00:39:22.761 --> 00:39:23.561
Amazon.

1015
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:24.473
Yes, Sam.

1016
00:39:24.473 --> 00:39:25.273
OK, I'm--

1017
00:39:25.273 --> 00:39:27.270
I'm getting a lot of big
feelings off everyone.


1018
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:28.853
I'm-- I'm riding
these waves with you.


1019
00:39:28.853 --> 00:39:30.903
And I got to tell you, I knew
today was going to be hard.


1020
00:39:30.903 --> 00:39:31.913
I knew that.

1021
00:39:31.913 --> 00:39:34.393
So I got you a treat
it's right over there.


1022
00:39:34.393 --> 00:39:35.513
What is it?

1023
00:39:35.513 --> 00:39:37.223
That's a
box full of donuts.


1024
00:39:37.223 --> 00:39:40.163
And each donut in there has
one of your names on it.


1025
00:39:40.163 --> 00:39:42.473
Do you think
we're little children?


1026
00:39:42.473 --> 00:39:43.313
You're
not going to like


1027
00:39:43.313 --> 00:39:45.814
my answer, which is you are
acting like a bunch of brats


1028
00:39:45.814 --> 00:39:46.616
- right now.
- Whoa!


1029
00:39:46.616 --> 00:39:48.023
Oh, my god.

1030
00:39:48.023 --> 00:39:50.773
That's it?

1031
00:39:50.773 --> 00:39:55.033
Sam, we quit.

1032
00:39:55.033 --> 00:39:56.243
OK.

1033
00:39:56.243 --> 00:39:57.951
Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.


1034
00:39:57.951 --> 00:39:59.563
Quitting as in
shuttering the show?


1035
00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:00.823
Maybe she
can change, you know?


1036
00:40:00.823 --> 00:40:01.873
She can't.

1037
00:40:01.873 --> 00:40:02.956
Is this serious?

1038
00:40:02.956 --> 00:40:03.883
OK, we need to talk.

1039
00:40:03.883 --> 00:40:05.686
This whole situation has
gotten very out of hand.


1040
00:40:06.488 --> 00:40:07.363
Yeah.

1041
00:40:07.363 --> 00:40:09.763
All right, this
is a little runaway train.


1042
00:40:09.763 --> 00:40:12.923
I think we need to talk
through some of our issues


1043
00:40:12.923 --> 00:40:13.723
and make it right.

1044
00:40:13.723 --> 00:40:15.403
We're certainly not
going to stop the show.


1045
00:40:15.403 --> 00:40:16.611
Don't be sheeple!

1046
00:40:19.713 --> 00:40:21.033
Follow me.

1047
00:40:21.033 --> 00:40:21.993
Oh, great.

1048
00:40:21.993 --> 00:40:24.641
Just like your mom
walked out on you, right?


1049
00:40:25.683 --> 00:40:26.783
Oh my God.

1050
00:40:26.783 --> 00:40:27.881
- Whoa.
- That was crazy, bro.


1051
00:40:28.683 --> 00:40:29.613
- Tsk-tsk.
- I'm sorry, man.


1052
00:40:29.613 --> 00:40:30.480
I'm sorry.

1053
00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:31.563
Sam, you got to do better.

1054
00:40:31.563 --> 00:40:32.363
That was wild.

1055
00:40:33.163 --> 00:40:36.183
Low blow, Sam.

1056
00:40:36.183 --> 00:40:38.148
Guys.

1057
00:40:38.148 --> 00:40:39.273
I'm sorry, Sam.

1058
00:40:52.056 --> 00:40:53.723
You're
not cut out for this.


1059
00:41:06.383 --> 00:41:07.643
Yes.

1060
00:41:07.643 --> 00:41:09.083
Yes.
Yes.


1061
00:41:09.083 --> 00:41:10.013
Come on, let's talk.

1062
00:41:12.713 --> 00:41:14.003
Come on.

1063
00:41:14.003 --> 00:41:14.903
Come back.

1064
00:41:14.903 --> 00:41:16.783
Rudie, come back!

1065
00:41:16.783 --> 00:41:19.933
Don't-- please.

1066
00:41:19.933 --> 00:41:23.233
Gerald, don't fucking
dim the lights, man!


1067
00:41:23.233 --> 00:41:24.408
Work with me, Gerald!

1068
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:50.583
Did you have an
abortion like a few years ago?


1069
00:41:50.583 --> 00:41:51.393
Was that you?

1070
00:41:51.393 --> 00:41:52.353
No.

1071
00:41:52.353 --> 00:41:54.228
Oh, you wanted
to freeze your eggs,


1072
00:41:54.228 --> 00:41:55.358
and you couldn't afford it.

1073
00:41:55.358 --> 00:41:56.691
More chardonnay?

1074
00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:57.603
Yes, yes.

1075
00:41:57.603 --> 00:41:59.998
Yessiree, Bob, I will
take more, please.


1076
00:41:59.998 --> 00:42:02.181
Me too.

1077
00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:04.473
I'm going to have
to put mine in a doggy bag.


1078
00:42:04.473 --> 00:42:05.705
Oh, why?

1079
00:42:05.705 --> 00:42:06.663
I have to go.

1080
00:42:06.663 --> 00:42:08.673
I have a date in 20 minutes.

1081
00:42:08.673 --> 00:42:11.103
And it's at the racetrack,
which is 35 minutes away.


1082
00:42:11.103 --> 00:42:12.213
So you do the math.

1083
00:42:12.213 --> 00:42:13.153
Racetrack?

1084
00:42:13.153 --> 00:42:13.953
Listen.

1085
00:42:13.953 --> 00:42:15.063
Have a blast tonight.

1086
00:42:15.063 --> 00:42:17.653
Life is a non-stop party,
or you're doing it wrong.


1087
00:42:17.653 --> 00:42:18.643
- Got it?
- Yeah.


1088
00:42:18.643 --> 00:42:19.443
Good.

1089
00:42:19.443 --> 00:42:21.483
Hang in there.

1090
00:42:21.483 --> 00:42:23.133
Thank you.

1091
00:42:23.133 --> 00:42:24.433
You're the best.

1092
00:42:24.433 --> 00:42:27.063
Thanks for
paying for my drink.


1093
00:42:27.063 --> 00:42:30.493
Gosh,
I love that girl.


1094
00:42:30.493 --> 00:42:31.293
Oh, hey.

1095
00:42:31.293 --> 00:42:33.933
I just thought of a joke.

1096
00:42:33.933 --> 00:42:37.935
What do horses drink?

1097
00:42:37.935 --> 00:42:40.983
Um, Chardon-neigh?

1098
00:42:40.983 --> 00:42:41.973
Yeah.

1099
00:42:41.973 --> 00:42:43.278
You got it on the first try.

1100
00:42:57.627 --> 00:43:00.263
Hey.

1101
00:43:00.263 --> 00:43:01.473
Hi.

1102
00:43:01.473 --> 00:43:02.273
Oh.

1103
00:43:02.273 --> 00:43:03.073
Hi.

1104
00:43:03.073 --> 00:43:06.333
I feel like I know you,
but I'm like wee, wee, wee.


1105
00:43:06.333 --> 00:43:07.510
I should really go home.

1106
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:08.343
Oh, no.

1107
00:43:08.343 --> 00:43:09.168
That'd be sad.

1108
00:43:09.168 --> 00:43:09.968
Why?

1109
00:43:09.968 --> 00:43:12.201
Well,
because I just got here.


1110
00:43:12.201 --> 00:43:13.029
Oh.

1111
00:43:13.029 --> 00:43:14.643
You
had a rough day?


1112
00:43:14.643 --> 00:43:16.383
My boss is in here.

1113
00:43:16.383 --> 00:43:17.716
He's in your phone?

1114
00:43:17.716 --> 00:43:20.343
I had 17 missed
calls from my boss.


1115
00:43:20.343 --> 00:43:22.873
My boss, he says no.

1116
00:43:22.873 --> 00:43:25.759
Maybe he was
calling with 17 compliments?


1117
00:43:25.759 --> 00:43:30.193
I wish!

1118
00:43:30.193 --> 00:43:31.553
Hey, you know what?

1119
00:43:31.553 --> 00:43:32.911
- I thought of a joke.
- Hmm.


1120
00:43:32.911 --> 00:43:33.713
You
want to hear it?


1121
00:43:33.713 --> 00:43:34.523
Yeah.

1122
00:43:34.523 --> 00:43:36.983
What
do horses drink?


1123
00:43:36.983 --> 00:43:40.263
Oh my God, no!

1124
00:43:40.263 --> 00:43:41.333
You heard that?

1125
00:43:41.333 --> 00:43:42.291
I'm sorry.

1126
00:43:42.291 --> 00:43:43.263
Oh my God.

1127
00:43:43.263 --> 00:43:44.613
You're so bad.

1128
00:43:44.613 --> 00:43:46.377
You stole my joke!

1129
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:49.368
You scared me.

1130
00:43:49.368 --> 00:43:50.493
You're brilliant.

1131
00:43:50.493 --> 00:43:52.500
Where did you come from?

1132
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.583
I don't know.

1133
00:43:53.583 --> 00:43:54.661
Heaven.

1134
00:43:54.661 --> 00:43:56.703
Maybe that's why I'm
wearing a white jean jacket.


1135
00:43:57.583 --> 00:43:59.853
I definitely
do believe in angels.


1136
00:43:59.853 --> 00:44:00.843
I do.

1137
00:44:00.843 --> 00:44:03.550
I'm going to say
something to you right now.


1138
00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.133
You're one of the
most beautiful women


1139
00:44:05.133 --> 00:44:08.103
I've ever seen in my life.

1140
00:44:08.103 --> 00:44:09.363
You're stunning.

1141
00:44:09.363 --> 00:44:11.218
Thanks.

1142
00:44:11.218 --> 00:44:12.093
Hold on.

1143
00:44:12.093 --> 00:44:14.235
Don't move.

1144
00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:15.333
I said, don't move.

1145
00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:16.323
Sorry.

1146
00:44:16.323 --> 00:44:17.123
I know.

1147
00:44:17.123 --> 00:44:18.873
It's hard.

1148
00:44:18.873 --> 00:44:19.743
Ow!

1149
00:44:19.743 --> 00:44:20.583
You're hot.

1150
00:44:20.583 --> 00:44:21.993
Ah, thanks.

1151
00:44:21.993 --> 00:44:23.643
Man, who are you?

1152
00:44:23.643 --> 00:44:25.713
Who are you?

1153
00:44:31.343 --> 00:44:33.133
You're so alert.

1154
00:44:33.133 --> 00:44:35.153
Let's go.

1155
00:44:35.153 --> 00:44:36.083
Where?

1156
00:44:36.083 --> 00:44:37.853
I want
you to see my house.


1157
00:44:37.853 --> 00:44:39.453
It's an apartment.

1158
00:44:39.453 --> 00:44:40.973
Oh.

1159
00:44:52.733 --> 00:44:54.203
Morning.

1160
00:44:55.683 --> 00:44:56.863
Oh my goodness.

1161
00:44:56.863 --> 00:44:57.663
Humans, wow.

1162
00:44:57.663 --> 00:44:58.743
We're just animals.

1163
00:44:58.743 --> 00:44:59.713
We're fucking.

1164
00:44:59.713 --> 00:45:00.513
Animals.

1165
00:45:00.513 --> 00:45:01.388
Totally.

1166
00:45:02.188 --> 00:45:03.125
Yeah.

1167
00:45:03.125 --> 00:45:05.077
Hey.

1168
00:45:05.077 --> 00:45:13.203
Uh, I want to do
Cooper in the play.


1169
00:45:13.203 --> 00:45:15.553
How do you
even know my play?


1170
00:45:15.553 --> 00:45:17.363
Because I'm Robbie.

1171
00:45:17.363 --> 00:45:19.673
I'm the head usher at the Regis.

1172
00:45:19.673 --> 00:45:20.718
What?

1173
00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:21.593
Come on.

1174
00:45:21.593 --> 00:45:22.468
You knew that, right?

1175
00:45:22.468 --> 00:45:24.123
I did not know that.

1176
00:45:24.123 --> 00:45:26.213
Then you should know
the play's shut down.


1177
00:45:26.213 --> 00:45:27.296
Yeah, I know.

1178
00:45:27.296 --> 00:45:28.688
What a better time to recast?

1179
00:45:28.688 --> 00:45:31.673
Look, I don't want to
be an usher forever.


1180
00:45:31.673 --> 00:45:34.138
I-
- I've got aspirations too.

1181
00:45:34.138 --> 00:45:35.863
I mean, look at you.

1182
00:45:35.863 --> 00:45:37.363
You were a scuzzy
little playwright,


1183
00:45:37.363 --> 00:45:39.673
and now you're a director.

1184
00:45:39.673 --> 00:45:40.513
Kind of.

1185
00:45:40.513 --> 00:45:42.283
Let me take a
crack at the Cooper monologue


1186
00:45:42.283 --> 00:45:44.293
from the final act,
from the final scene.


1187
00:45:44.293 --> 00:45:48.883
Please Ahem.

1188
00:45:48.883 --> 00:45:50.263
OK.

1189
00:45:50.263 --> 00:45:53.073
I killed daddy.

1190
00:45:53.073 --> 00:45:54.370
It was me.

1191
00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.703
I should have never taken him
down to that watering hole


1192
00:45:56.703 --> 00:45:57.723
by the mining company.

1193
00:45:57.723 --> 00:45:59.733
I'm going to stop you.

1194
00:45:59.733 --> 00:46:03.513
Um, I don't think that
you're Regis material.


1195
00:46:03.513 --> 00:46:04.313
I like you.

1196
00:46:04.313 --> 00:46:07.723
I think you're so
awesome and cool.


1197
00:46:07.723 --> 00:46:09.841
Bullshit.

1198
00:46:09.841 --> 00:46:10.883
What'd you say?

1199
00:46:10.883 --> 00:46:12.091
I said bullshit.

1200
00:46:15.543 --> 00:46:17.723
You know what?

1201
00:46:17.723 --> 00:46:21.648
I don't think you're
girlfriend material.


1202
00:46:21.648 --> 00:46:22.773
How do you feel about that?

1203
00:46:22.773 --> 00:46:23.843
Wait.

1204
00:46:23.843 --> 00:46:25.163
I thought we connected.

1205
00:46:25.163 --> 00:46:26.843
Nothing to see here!

1206
00:46:26.843 --> 00:46:29.051
Just a woman screwing
her underling.


1207
00:46:29.051 --> 00:46:30.218
That is a stretch!

1208
00:46:30.218 --> 00:46:31.733
Who reports to her!

1209
00:46:31.733 --> 00:46:32.533
Stretch!

1210
00:46:32.533 --> 00:46:34.395
Whatever
you say, boss.


1211
00:46:34.395 --> 00:46:35.703
Shut up!

1212
00:46:35.703 --> 00:46:37.623
I-
- I didn't even recognize him.

1213
00:46:37.623 --> 00:46:38.423
Burn.

1214
00:46:38.423 --> 00:46:40.688
Also, I was extremely
drunk, and he was not.


1215
00:46:40.688 --> 00:46:42.478
Then that
would be assault.


1216
00:46:42.478 --> 00:46:43.853
OK, by
that definition,


1217
00:46:43.853 --> 00:46:45.803
I have been assaulted
hundreds of times.


1218
00:46:45.803 --> 00:46:47.303
Sometimes
you have to buff


1219
00:46:47.303 --> 00:46:48.845
the veneer off the
status quo and lay


1220
00:46:48.845 --> 00:46:50.163
bare the truth beneath it.

1221
00:46:50.163 --> 00:46:51.841
But-- but you're a writer.

1222
00:46:51.841 --> 00:46:53.633
You must do that all
the time in your work.


1223
00:46:56.283 --> 00:46:58.893
Hey, give me
back my white jean jacket!


1224
00:46:58.893 --> 00:47:01.748
Here you
go, you stupid idiot!


1225
00:47:01.748 --> 00:47:02.748
Be careful!

1226
00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:15.921
We got 15
minutes left in our sesh, bro.


1227
00:47:15.921 --> 00:47:17.213
What do you want to talk about?

1228
00:47:17.213 --> 00:47:18.353
What hurts the most?

1229
00:47:18.353 --> 00:47:20.223
That you didn't
succeed, that you


1230
00:47:20.223 --> 00:47:24.473
were a female pawn for the
patriarchy set up to fail?


1231
00:47:24.473 --> 00:47:25.373
Is it my drinking?

1232
00:47:25.373 --> 00:47:26.333
Is it our drinking?

1233
00:47:26.333 --> 00:47:27.323
No.

1234
00:47:27.323 --> 00:47:29.003
Oh, it's the usher, right?

1235
00:47:29.003 --> 00:47:30.503
Dude, it's the usher.

1236
00:47:30.503 --> 00:47:33.743
He got you hot in the loins,
then he left you for dead?


1237
00:47:33.743 --> 00:47:34.823
What, is it Sheldon?

1238
00:47:34.823 --> 00:47:36.353
I mean, who cares about Sheldon?

1239
00:47:36.353 --> 00:47:38.813
What, are you afraid to
return Sheldon's phone calls?


1240
00:47:38.813 --> 00:47:41.393
You know, you always adopt
this childlike mentality


1241
00:47:41.393 --> 00:47:43.343
with powerful men.

1242
00:47:43.343 --> 00:47:44.951
Is it the square?

1243
00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:47.243
Because I need to bust it
out so you can remit payment.


1244
00:47:47.243 --> 00:47:49.368
What kind of
therapist babbles like this?


1245
00:47:49.368 --> 00:47:50.543
Are you a gumshoe?

1246
00:47:50.543 --> 00:47:51.773
Are you on cocaine again?

1247
00:47:51.773 --> 00:47:53.393
Are you using?

1248
00:47:53.393 --> 00:47:55.853
I don't even
know what you mean by that.


1249
00:47:55.853 --> 00:47:57.683
I think
you're on cocaine.


1250
00:47:57.683 --> 00:47:59.723
And I don't think we
should have sessions when


1251
00:47:59.723 --> 00:48:03.983
you're on the.

1252
00:48:03.983 --> 00:48:06.093
So you don't
want to use the Square or?


1253
00:48:06.093 --> 00:48:07.683
Here.
Here.


1254
00:48:07.683 --> 00:48:08.483
Fuck the Square.

1255
00:48:08.483 --> 00:48:09.283
Here.

1256
00:48:09.283 --> 00:48:11.123
You want money so bad?

1257
00:48:11.123 --> 00:48:12.153
There.

1258
00:48:12.153 --> 00:48:13.643
And I am not scared of Sheldon.

1259
00:48:13.643 --> 00:48:15.413
That's actually ridiculous.

1260
00:48:15.413 --> 00:48:17.396
You should be ashamed
of that theory.


1261
00:48:20.753 --> 00:48:21.553
Sheldon.

1262
00:48:23.736 --> 00:48:25.153
Where
have you been?


1263
00:48:25.153 --> 00:48:26.310
I'm treading water here.

1264
00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:28.393
I couldn't handle
the mutiny, obviously.


1265
00:48:28.393 --> 00:48:30.383
All
actors want is to act.


1266
00:48:30.383 --> 00:48:32.413
All day they're dying
to get back here


1267
00:48:32.413 --> 00:48:34.393
to be anyone but themselves.

1268
00:48:34.393 --> 00:48:37.783
You somehow made them
prefer their own lives


1269
00:48:37.783 --> 00:48:39.433
to the land of make-believe?

1270
00:48:39.433 --> 00:48:40.963
I mean, that's impressive, Sam.

1271
00:48:40.963 --> 00:48:42.553
Can you just
help me get Rudie to fold?


1272
00:48:42.553 --> 00:48:43.583
He blocked my number.

1273
00:48:43.583 --> 00:48:45.583
No, I will
not take on your drama.


1274
00:48:45.583 --> 00:48:46.873
Please
just help me out.


1275
00:48:46.873 --> 00:48:47.773
It's your theater.

1276
00:48:47.773 --> 00:48:51.233
I will
not take on your drama!


1277
00:48:51.233 --> 00:48:54.593
Look, what's behind
every powerful man?


1278
00:48:54.593 --> 00:48:56.063
A family with money?

1279
00:48:56.063 --> 00:49:00.995
A woman
who gains power by proxy.


1280
00:49:06.803 --> 00:49:08.993
Clara.

1281
00:49:08.993 --> 00:49:09.863
Come on, man.

1282
00:49:09.863 --> 00:49:15.106
Open the door.

1283
00:49:15.106 --> 00:49:15.993
Open the door!

1284
00:49:15.993 --> 00:49:17.423
God, Sam.

1285
00:49:17.423 --> 00:49:18.263
Hey.

1286
00:49:18.263 --> 00:49:19.553
I'm not
supposed to talk to you.


1287
00:49:19.553 --> 00:49:21.773
But you kind
of want to, don't you?


1288
00:49:21.773 --> 00:49:22.983
Well, I don't.

1289
00:49:22.983 --> 00:49:23.783
'Sup?

1290
00:49:23.783 --> 00:49:24.633
A lot of bowls.

1291
00:49:24.633 --> 00:49:25.433
Hmm.

1292
00:49:25.433 --> 00:49:26.233
I'd be careful.

1293
00:49:26.233 --> 00:49:27.613
You're on really thin ice.

1294
00:49:27.613 --> 00:49:28.413
Am I?

1295
00:49:33.753 --> 00:49:35.553
So life is good, then?

1296
00:49:35.553 --> 00:49:37.893
Having fun following a
male-led mutiny against


1297
00:49:37.893 --> 00:49:39.523
a first-time female director?

1298
00:49:39.523 --> 00:49:40.323
My God.

1299
00:49:40.323 --> 00:49:42.180
Sam, don't embrace those labels.

1300
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.013
They're not
labels, they're facts.


1301
00:49:44.013 --> 00:49:46.821
I have a vagina, no?

1302
00:49:46.821 --> 00:49:47.863
I don't know.

1303
00:49:47.863 --> 00:49:49.423
Fact--
you have one too.


1304
00:49:49.423 --> 00:49:52.603
Fact-- you and your vagina took
me and my vagina for granted.


1305
00:49:52.603 --> 00:49:55.063
And you and your vagina left
me and my vagina for dead.


1306
00:49:55.063 --> 00:49:56.323
I'm
really uncomfortable


1307
00:49:56.323 --> 00:49:57.973
with the direction this
conversation is going.


1308
00:49:57.973 --> 00:49:58.773
Are you?

1309
00:49:58.773 --> 00:50:00.658
Because I thought
you loved the body.


1310
00:50:00.658 --> 00:50:01.531
I do.

1311
00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:03.797
And I thought you
loved medical terminology.


1312
00:50:03.797 --> 00:50:04.599
I do.

1313
00:50:04.599 --> 00:50:05.623
You turned
your back on me.


1314
00:50:05.623 --> 00:50:07.423
And now you and me are
sitting here with our fucking


1315
00:50:07.423 --> 00:50:08.353
dicks in our hands.

1316
00:50:08.353 --> 00:50:11.353
We got nothing to do.

1317
00:50:11.353 --> 00:50:12.278
Fuck.

1318
00:50:12.278 --> 00:50:13.078
You're right.

1319
00:50:16.323 --> 00:50:18.063
Fucking Rudie.

1320
00:50:18.063 --> 00:50:19.683
He's projecting his
mother onto you.


1321
00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:21.713
It's not fair.

1322
00:50:21.713 --> 00:50:23.005
You're completely childless.

1323
00:50:23.005 --> 00:50:24.463
He doesn't
go to therapy.


1324
00:50:24.463 --> 00:50:26.126
I bet he doesn't do
anything like that.


1325
00:50:26.126 --> 00:50:28.043
He doesn't
do any work on himself.


1326
00:50:28.043 --> 00:50:32.473
I do so much work
on myself, Sam.


1327
00:50:32.473 --> 00:50:33.827
I'm so scared of
losing the show.


1328
00:50:33.827 --> 00:50:34.629
We won't.

1329
00:50:34.629 --> 00:50:35.923
We're going to get
it back, Clara.


1330
00:50:35.923 --> 00:50:36.723
Yeah.

1331
00:50:36.723 --> 00:50:38.773
You have to talk to him.

1332
00:50:38.773 --> 00:50:40.230
OK.

1333
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:41.563
The show must go on.

1334
00:50:41.563 --> 00:50:42.433
Yes.

1335
00:50:42.433 --> 00:50:43.766
The show must go on!

1336
00:50:43.766 --> 00:50:44.653
It has to.

1337
00:50:44.653 --> 00:50:46.153
God,
he does this to me.


1338
00:50:46.153 --> 00:50:49.053
He does this to everyone.

1339
00:50:49.053 --> 00:50:51.723
That's what a star does.

1340
00:50:51.723 --> 00:50:53.203
You're a star too.

1341
00:50:53.203 --> 00:50:54.661
Do you
really think so?


1342
00:50:57.623 --> 00:51:00.423
I hate how much I needed
to hear that from you.


1343
00:51:00.423 --> 00:51:01.668
Never forget that.

1344
00:51:04.903 --> 00:51:08.665
Also, full
disclosure, I fucked Greggy.


1345
00:51:08.665 --> 00:51:09.873
It was something I had to do.

1346
00:51:13.213 --> 00:51:14.173
I'm glad you came.

1347
00:51:14.173 --> 00:51:15.813
- Me you.
- Thought you might.


1348
00:51:15.813 --> 00:51:17.293
Vag-- vag you came.

1349
00:51:17.293 --> 00:51:18.783
Vag you came.

1350
00:51:18.783 --> 00:51:19.813
I was nervous.

1351
00:51:19.813 --> 00:51:20.983
- Yeah.
- Look.


1352
00:51:20.983 --> 00:51:22.593
- I think I'm--
- Oh my God.


1353
00:51:22.593 --> 00:51:23.883
I was so nervous.

1354
00:51:23.883 --> 00:51:24.983
Yeah.

1355
00:51:24.983 --> 00:51:25.783
God.

1356
00:51:25.783 --> 00:51:29.458
See, he always finds
these cushy jobs.


1357
00:51:29.458 --> 00:51:31.683
Here we are.

1358
00:51:31.683 --> 00:51:33.035
Where?

1359
00:51:33.035 --> 00:51:34.523
There.

1360
00:51:34.523 --> 00:51:35.333
Oh.

1361
00:51:35.333 --> 00:51:36.773
Hey, Rudie.

1362
00:51:36.773 --> 00:51:38.993
You're looking great, bud.

1363
00:51:38.993 --> 00:51:43.133
I am so sorry that you had to
sit there and watch me struggle


1364
00:51:43.133 --> 00:51:44.223
through my learning curve.

1365
00:51:44.223 --> 00:51:48.893
It wasn't fair to you, no
matter how imbalanced the scales


1366
00:51:48.893 --> 00:51:50.380
of gender are in directing.

1367
00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:52.546
Stick to the script.

1368
00:51:52.546 --> 00:51:54.588
But, Rudie, the
show must go on, right?


1369
00:51:54.588 --> 00:51:56.963
You should have
thought about that before you


1370
00:51:56.963 --> 00:51:58.673
went ballistic in
a tech rehearsal


1371
00:51:58.673 --> 00:52:01.373
and turned my life's
passion into a chore!


1372
00:52:01.373 --> 00:52:05.693
Rudie, you hate chores
because your mother turned


1373
00:52:05.693 --> 00:52:07.553
love itself into a chore.

1374
00:52:07.553 --> 00:52:11.303
But I am not her, 
I promise you.

1375
00:52:11.303 --> 00:52:16.603
And you cannot let those
ancient feelings stop our show.


1376
00:52:16.603 --> 00:52:19.063
You don't belong
here shilling fast fashion.


1377
00:52:19.063 --> 00:52:19.863
OK?

1378
00:52:19.863 --> 00:52:20.713
It's crass.

1379
00:52:20.713 --> 00:52:21.630
She's right.

1380
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:23.923
You are one of the
best damn actors


1381
00:52:23.923 --> 00:52:26.083
I have ever laid eyes on.

1382
00:52:26.083 --> 00:52:28.343
You belong on the stage!

1383
00:52:28.343 --> 00:52:31.933
The show must go on.

1384
00:52:31.933 --> 00:52:33.523
The
commute is better.


1385
00:52:33.523 --> 00:52:38.503
The show must go on!

1386
00:52:42.703 --> 00:52:48.373
The show must go on.

1387
00:52:48.373 --> 00:52:51.453
The show must go on.

1388
00:52:56.053 --> 00:52:59.323
Oh, this feels good!

1389
00:52:59.323 --> 00:53:00.843
- Yes.
- It does feel good.


1390
00:53:00.843 --> 00:53:01.773
I have to admit it.

1391
00:53:01.773 --> 00:53:04.143
It feels good.

1392
00:53:04.143 --> 00:53:05.183
I'm in.

1393
00:53:05.183 --> 00:53:06.783
Amazing!

1394
00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:09.133
I'll rally the cast.

1395
00:53:09.133 --> 00:53:09.933
Wait.

1396
00:53:09.933 --> 00:53:11.493
Was there an earthquake today?

1397
00:53:11.493 --> 00:53:12.873
No, I don't think so.

1398
00:53:12.873 --> 00:53:13.790
Oh, weird.

1399
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:16.813
It looks like you got
ready during an earthquake.


1400
00:53:16.813 --> 00:53:19.076
We are back!

1401
00:53:19.876 --> 00:53:22.723
We are Back!

1402
00:53:22.723 --> 00:53:24.843
Rain's coming in.

1403
00:53:24.843 --> 00:53:29.013
Rain's coming in!

1404
00:53:29.013 --> 00:53:32.763
I am hungry!

1405
00:53:32.763 --> 00:53:33.713
Oh, man.

1406
00:53:33.713 --> 00:53:36.333
Sam, aren't you always
hungry at this age?


1407
00:53:36.333 --> 00:53:37.373
I'm like, oh!

1408
00:53:37.373 --> 00:53:39.213
Oh, I missed you guys.

1409
00:53:39.213 --> 00:53:41.793
I love you!

1410
00:53:41.793 --> 00:53:45.543
Being here in
this group, I missed that.


1411
00:53:45.543 --> 00:53:48.033
I missed feeling the room.

1412
00:53:48.033 --> 00:53:49.631
I missed hearing
language, staying


1413
00:53:49.631 --> 00:53:50.673
alert, going what's that?

1414
00:53:50.673 --> 00:53:52.233
What's my line, and
then knowing that it was


1415
00:53:52.233 --> 00:53:53.433
already in me the whole time.

1416
00:53:53.433 --> 00:53:54.993
You all
missed each other.


1417
00:53:54.993 --> 00:53:55.846
Got it!

1418
00:53:55.846 --> 00:53:56.763
Yeah.

1419
00:53:56.763 --> 00:53:59.523
We fiddled with the
pressure balancing valve.


1420
00:53:59.523 --> 00:54:02.506
It should keep the rain
temperature from fluctuating.


1421
00:54:02.506 --> 00:54:03.423
Great, guys.

1422
00:54:03.423 --> 00:54:04.426
Nice adjustment.

1423
00:54:04.426 --> 00:54:05.343
Yeah.

1424
00:54:05.343 --> 00:54:08.773
That way you can't
get severely burned.


1425
00:54:08.773 --> 00:54:09.648
Cool beans.

1426
00:54:10.448 --> 00:54:12.153
It's
pretty cool beans!


1427
00:54:12.153 --> 00:54:13.540
Why do you
say it so high like that?


1428
00:54:14.342 --> 00:54:15.303
Why do you
say it so high like that?


1429
00:54:15.303 --> 00:54:16.600
Shut up!

1430
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.433
All right.

1431
00:54:17.433 --> 00:54:18.663
All right, guys.

1432
00:54:18.663 --> 00:54:21.463
This production
is a total fucking heat roller.


1433
00:54:21.463 --> 00:54:22.737
Not sure what
that means, guys, but let's


1434
00:54:22.737 --> 00:54:23.538
keep our--

1435
00:54:23.538 --> 00:54:24.339
Is heat
roller good or bad?


1436
00:54:24.339 --> 00:54:25.383
Keep our
thoughts up there, OK?


1437
00:54:25.383 --> 00:54:27.404
We're trying to focus down here.
We've got a big job ahead.


1438
00:54:28.206 --> 00:54:29.013
Yeah, drinks later.

1439
00:54:29.013 --> 00:54:29.815
Love you.

1440
00:54:29.815 --> 00:54:31.226
Great to
see you guys again.


1441
00:54:32.026 --> 00:54:33.453
Fuck off!

1442
00:54:33.453 --> 00:54:35.163
Let's shake that off.

1443
00:54:35.163 --> 00:54:39.243
You guys, I promised you
a treat once, didn't I?


1444
00:54:39.243 --> 00:54:42.693
Well, today is the day
that treat is back--


1445
00:54:42.693 --> 00:54:44.403
a bajillion donuts.

1446
00:54:44.403 --> 00:54:45.203
Hello.

1447
00:54:45.203 --> 00:54:46.245
Oh my god.

1448
00:54:46.245 --> 00:54:47.123
I love donuts!

1449
00:54:47.123 --> 00:54:48.563
They make me so happy.

1450
00:54:48.563 --> 00:54:52.003
Cast donuts, huh?

1451
00:54:52.003 --> 00:54:53.443
Typical.

1452
00:54:53.443 --> 00:54:54.973
Robbie, enter stage right.

1453
00:54:54.973 --> 00:54:57.139
Robbie, don't.

1454
00:54:57.139 --> 00:55:00.583
Sugar can
cause complications


1455
00:55:00.583 --> 00:55:06.741
that ultimately result in
death, inflammation, diabetes.


1456
00:55:06.741 --> 00:55:07.783
Come on, man.

1457
00:55:07.783 --> 00:55:12.153
One donut
could realistically


1458
00:55:12.153 --> 00:55:14.531
feed up to 10 people.

1459
00:55:14.531 --> 00:55:16.323
What in God's
name are you doing?


1460
00:55:16.323 --> 00:55:17.433
And what's the accent?

1461
00:55:17.433 --> 00:55:18.533
What is this?

1462
00:55:18.533 --> 00:55:21.703
He's
taking two donuts!


1463
00:55:21.703 --> 00:55:23.606
Exeunt Robbie.

1464
00:55:23.606 --> 00:55:25.773
You know, a lot
of different personalities


1465
00:55:25.773 --> 00:55:27.333
in here, but let's just
keep the energy up.


1466
00:55:27.333 --> 00:55:28.333
Yoo hoo.

1467
00:55:28.333 --> 00:55:29.478
Oh, Thimberly.

1468
00:55:29.478 --> 00:55:30.873
You slipped in undetected.

1469
00:55:30.873 --> 00:55:33.595
That's what
I said to Miles last night.


1470
00:55:35.013 --> 00:55:36.243
Good news, gang.

1471
00:55:36.243 --> 00:55:39.203
We got Alabama jazz.

1472
00:55:39.203 --> 00:55:40.003
Hurray!

1473
00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:41.963
Alabama jazz!

1474
00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:42.950
Amazing.

1475
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:44.432
Really
punctures the eyes.


1476
00:55:44.432 --> 00:55:45.234
Hey, gal.

1477
00:55:45.234 --> 00:55:46.813
Do you want to see our
curtain call or what?


1478
00:55:46.813 --> 00:55:49.483
Yeah, a little curtain
call showcase for Thimberly.


1479
00:55:49.483 --> 00:55:50.593
Come right this way.

1480
00:55:50.593 --> 00:55:52.075
And--

1481
00:55:52.875 --> 00:55:54.668
Oh, look at this.

1482
00:55:56.253 --> 00:55:57.053
Oh.

1483
00:55:57.053 --> 00:55:58.823
Oh, my friends.

1484
00:55:58.823 --> 00:56:01.023
I believe we're
ready for previews.


1485
00:56:01.023 --> 00:56:03.953
I knew it.
I knew it.


1486
00:56:03.953 --> 00:56:06.120
Miles and
I would like to invite you


1487
00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:08.663
all over for a cautiously
celebratory dinner tomorrow


1488
00:56:08.663 --> 00:56:10.103
night at 3:30.

1489
00:56:10.103 --> 00:56:11.881
Yes!

1490
00:56:11.881 --> 00:56:12.923
I accept.

1491
00:56:12.923 --> 00:56:14.063
Will
there be lobster?


1492
00:56:14.063 --> 00:56:15.533
Miles
does all the cooking.


1493
00:56:15.533 --> 00:56:18.053
Well, that's such a
wonderful invite, Thimberly.


1494
00:56:18.053 --> 00:56:19.763
- Dress sharp.
- Wow.


1495
00:56:19.763 --> 00:56:20.563
OK.

1496
00:56:20.563 --> 00:56:21.863
Oh, a 3:30 dinner?

1497
00:56:21.863 --> 00:56:23.196
No ripped jeans.

1498
00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:27.043
- Oh, I say.
- I dare say.


1499
00:56:27.043 --> 00:56:28.053
Are we
at Buckingham Palace?


1500
00:56:28.053 --> 00:56:30.108
I feel
like I'm in London.


1501
00:56:30.108 --> 00:56:32.127
Act like
you've been there before.


1502
00:56:32.127 --> 00:56:34.213
Look at this house.

1503
00:56:34.213 --> 00:56:35.013
Hi.

1504
00:56:35.013 --> 00:56:35.813
Hello.

1505
00:56:35.813 --> 00:56:37.463
Hi.

1506
00:56:37.463 --> 00:56:38.338
Thimberly and Miles?

1507
00:56:38.338 --> 00:56:39.138
Yes.

1508
00:56:39.138 --> 00:56:39.938
Yes.

1509
00:56:39.938 --> 00:56:41.763
It's that
house over there.


1510
00:56:41.763 --> 00:56:43.353
Yeah, the small one.

1511
00:56:43.353 --> 00:56:44.283
Over there.

1512
00:56:44.283 --> 00:56:45.243
Yeah, there's a path.

1513
00:56:45.243 --> 00:56:47.173
Open your eyes.

1514
00:56:47.173 --> 00:56:48.903
Take the path.
Just take the path and go.


1515
00:56:48.903 --> 00:56:49.893
All right.

1516
00:56:49.893 --> 00:56:51.183
Are you stupid?

1517
00:56:51.183 --> 00:56:52.488
Go down the path.

1518
00:56:52.488 --> 00:56:54.025
- This way!
- Just keep walking.


1519
00:56:54.025 --> 00:56:54.827
Oh, hi.

1520
00:56:54.827 --> 00:56:56.191
Careful
on that top step.


1521
00:56:56.191 --> 00:56:57.583
Guess it's down here.

1522
00:56:57.583 --> 00:56:58.703
Come on down.

1523
00:56:58.703 --> 00:57:00.495
I want
to go to that house.


1524
00:57:02.868 --> 00:57:04.743
Would
anyone like more beans?


1525
00:57:04.743 --> 00:57:06.078
I dream of beanie.

1526
00:57:06.078 --> 00:57:08.463
Did you just
say, I dream of beanie?


1527
00:57:08.463 --> 00:57:09.503
Oh my God.

1528
00:57:09.503 --> 00:57:12.663
Beyond
my wildest beans.


1529
00:57:12.663 --> 00:57:14.163
You
know, it's so funny.


1530
00:57:14.163 --> 00:57:16.366
We thought you lived up
in the large, white house.


1531
00:57:16.366 --> 00:57:18.033
The
mansion up on the hill,


1532
00:57:18.033 --> 00:57:19.413
the big, white mansion.

1533
00:57:19.413 --> 00:57:20.523
But we're not there.

1534
00:57:20.523 --> 00:57:21.691
No.

1535
00:57:21.691 --> 00:57:23.733
How else do you think we
would accumulate wealth?


1536
00:57:23.733 --> 00:57:25.443
- Ah.
- We scrimp, we save.


1537
00:57:25.443 --> 00:57:28.791
We live below our means in the
guest house of our own mansion.


1538
00:57:28.791 --> 00:57:30.333
Why
don't people do that?


1539
00:57:30.333 --> 00:57:32.500
And a
TikToker lives in our mansion.


1540
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.396
I love TikTok.

1541
00:57:34.396 --> 00:57:36.063
And
this is Sugar Belle.


1542
00:57:36.063 --> 00:57:37.929
She lives under the table.

1543
00:57:41.583 --> 00:57:43.033
Would anyone like
some more water?


1544
00:57:43.033 --> 00:57:43.833
Hmm.

1545
00:57:43.833 --> 00:57:45.033
Thank you.

1546
00:57:45.033 --> 00:57:47.418
You know, your art
here is so evocative.


1547
00:57:48.218 --> 00:57:49.163
Oh, yes.

1548
00:57:49.163 --> 00:57:50.288
Really, though.

1549
00:57:50.288 --> 00:57:53.006
The horse, kind of classic
symbol of aristocracy.


1550
00:57:53.006 --> 00:57:54.423
I
love the back legs.


1551
00:57:54.423 --> 00:57:56.073
Pardon me.

1552
00:57:56.073 --> 00:57:58.593
Sheldon intimated
that perhaps you lot


1553
00:57:58.593 --> 00:58:00.273
had skipped some
rehearsals and were


1554
00:58:00.273 --> 00:58:01.743
squandering our investment.

1555
00:58:01.743 --> 00:58:03.243
Don't start, Miles.

1556
00:58:03.243 --> 00:58:05.908
It is a fair
line of inquiry, Thimberly.


1557
00:58:05.908 --> 00:58:07.533
It was
a creative decision.


1558
00:58:08.333 --> 00:58:09.783
Yeah.

1559
00:58:09.783 --> 00:58:13.443
We needed to take
a beat, come back to it fresh.


1560
00:58:13.443 --> 00:58:18.573
Young man,
that's a waste of our funds.


1561
00:58:18.573 --> 00:58:20.103
Miles,
can I just ask, is


1562
00:58:20.103 --> 00:58:22.020
that your actual
shoulder muscle,


1563
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.643
or is that a shoulder pad?
Can I--


1564
00:58:23.643 --> 00:58:24.443
Oh.

1565
00:58:24.443 --> 00:58:26.103
Oh my God.

1566
00:58:26.103 --> 00:58:27.061
Wow, Miles.

1567
00:58:27.061 --> 00:58:28.299
It's a muscle.

1568
00:58:28.299 --> 00:58:29.585
Oh!

1569
00:58:29.585 --> 00:58:31.043
Muscle,
muscle, muscle.


1570
00:58:31.043 --> 00:58:31.923
Hercules.

1571
00:58:31.923 --> 00:58:35.343
My secret is I
don't eat breakfast or lunch.


1572
00:58:35.343 --> 00:58:36.753
And then for dinner--

1573
00:58:36.753 --> 00:58:39.103
almost nothing.

1574
00:58:39.103 --> 00:58:42.123
And then you have to
keep moving all the time.


1575
00:58:42.123 --> 00:58:44.433
Never stop moving and stay low.

1576
00:58:44.433 --> 00:58:47.223
Always keep moving because it
keeps the pounds off and will


1577
00:58:47.223 --> 00:58:48.753
keep your metabolism high.

1578
00:58:48.753 --> 00:58:51.013
Move, move, move, move, move.

1579
00:58:51.013 --> 00:58:51.813
Keep moving.

1580
00:58:51.813 --> 00:58:54.753
And stay low when I walk,
lower than you would think.


1581
00:58:54.753 --> 00:58:57.063
Never stop moving.

1582
00:58:57.063 --> 00:58:59.923
And that's why I'm
fit as a fiddle.


1583
00:58:59.923 --> 00:59:01.378
Bravo.

1584
00:59:01.378 --> 00:59:02.833
- Bravo.
- I love you guys.


1585
00:59:02.833 --> 00:59:04.033
That
sounds hard, fella.


1586
00:59:04.033 --> 00:59:05.563
I show no
signs of slowing down.


1587
00:59:05.563 --> 00:59:06.763
No, you don't.

1588
00:59:06.763 --> 00:59:07.846
Oh, thank you.

1589
00:59:07.846 --> 00:59:09.133
Do you know clapping push-ups?

1590
00:59:09.133 --> 00:59:10.063
I do those too.

1591
00:59:10.063 --> 00:59:11.893
Miles, if you
can do that, you have to!


1592
00:59:11.893 --> 00:59:13.601
No, I'm
not going to do them.


1593
00:59:13.601 --> 00:59:14.488
I really-
- I really--

1594
00:59:14.488 --> 00:59:15.363
I beg thee!

1595
00:59:15.363 --> 00:59:17.753
For you,
perhaps, young lady.


1596
00:59:17.753 --> 00:59:18.553
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.


1597
00:59:18.553 --> 00:59:19.353
Lucky day.

1598
00:59:19.353 --> 00:59:20.153
Come on, come
on, come on, come on.


1599
00:59:20.153 --> 00:59:20.953
Let's see.

1600
00:59:20.953 --> 00:59:22.966
Miles!

1601
00:59:22.966 --> 00:59:24.883
Miles, Miles,
Miles, Miles, Miles.


1602
00:59:24.883 --> 00:59:26.050
The inspiration!

1603
00:59:29.213 --> 00:59:31.072
And--

1604
00:59:33.594 --> 00:59:35.011
He
must be exhausted.


1605
00:59:35.011 --> 00:59:36.493
- Oh my god.
- Miles?


1606
00:59:36.493 --> 00:59:37.663
- Miles?
- Bro.


1607
00:59:37.663 --> 00:59:39.550
Miles?

1608
00:59:39.550 --> 00:59:42.107
Is he dead
or is he just being silly?


1609
00:59:42.107 --> 00:59:43.024
Miles!

1610
00:59:46.298 --> 00:59:47.673
Sam,
what did you do?


1611
00:59:47.673 --> 00:59:50.836
Miles, don't go.

1612
00:59:50.836 --> 00:59:52.600
Not yet.

1613
00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:56.853
Don't leave me alone
with the staff.


1614
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:12.353
Hello, hello.

1615
01:00:12.353 --> 01:00:14.033
Hello, Corden!

1616
01:00:14.033 --> 01:00:15.753
Corden.

1617
01:00:15.753 --> 01:00:17.343
Corden, Corden!

1618
01:00:17.343 --> 01:00:19.053
How you doing, man?

1619
01:00:19.053 --> 01:00:20.483
- Amazing.
- There we go.


1620
01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:22.553
- I'm back.
- How was Channing?


1621
01:00:22.553 --> 01:00:23.353
Was he nice?

1622
01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:25.673
Did you
make, like, $1,000,000?


1623
01:00:25.673 --> 01:00:27.593
Channing
was-- was chill, yeah.


1624
01:00:27.593 --> 01:00:28.393
We had fun.

1625
01:00:28.393 --> 01:00:32.093
And my starmeter raised 19%.

1626
01:00:32.093 --> 01:00:33.353
So that counts for something.

1627
01:00:33.353 --> 01:00:36.863
But it feels good to be
back here with you guys.


1628
01:00:36.863 --> 01:00:40.493
You're like family to me in
that I don't know you that well,


1629
01:00:40.493 --> 01:00:42.383
- but I care about you.
- That's so sweet.


1630
01:00:42.383 --> 01:00:43.183
Yeah.

1631
01:00:43.183 --> 01:00:48.251
And before anybody asks, no,
I haven't changed too much.


1632
01:00:48.251 --> 01:00:50.043
Well, your
body hasn't changed.


1633
01:00:50.043 --> 01:00:51.188
That's for sure.

1634
01:00:51.188 --> 01:00:53.963
Yeah, your
body hasn't changed either.


1635
01:00:53.963 --> 01:00:55.989
Please,
how can you tell?


1636
01:00:55.989 --> 01:00:57.513
I'm swimming in this thing.

1637
01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:02.863
Miles is dead.

1638
01:01:02.863 --> 01:01:03.738
No shit.

1639
01:01:18.213 --> 01:01:21.493
Oh, looks
like it might rain.


1640
01:01:21.493 --> 01:01:26.653
Rain might clear away the smoke
from all those factory farms.


1641
01:01:26.653 --> 01:01:28.123
Oh, boy.

1642
01:01:28.123 --> 01:01:31.491
Sit down here to
my morning paper.


1643
01:01:47.843 --> 01:01:50.803
Home sweet home.

1644
01:01:50.803 --> 01:01:54.883
This is our third home,
due to factory fires.


1645
01:01:57.953 --> 01:02:00.983
So excuse me, mama.

1646
01:02:00.983 --> 01:02:04.973
I'm going to go show
you where Buck is now.


1647
01:02:04.973 --> 01:02:09.383
Said I'm
drunk on raspberry cordials.


1648
01:02:09.383 --> 01:02:12.768
Yes, I am.

1649
01:02:15.543 --> 01:02:20.228
Oh, my grandmamma,
grandpappy, and the house.


1650
01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:25.603
Oh, the house before we
lost it in the factory fire.


1651
01:02:31.143 --> 01:02:34.578
There it
is, that familiar smell,


1652
01:02:34.578 --> 01:02:37.433
the factory fire.

1653
01:02:37.433 --> 01:02:40.673
We've had three
this year already.


1654
01:02:40.673 --> 01:02:42.953
What's one more?

1655
01:02:42.953 --> 01:02:45.738
I've lost all my
friends in those fires.


1656
01:02:48.593 --> 01:02:49.393
It's blazing!

1657
01:03:12.063 --> 01:03:13.443
Do they even like it?

1658
01:03:13.443 --> 01:03:15.163
It was so lukewarm.

1659
01:03:15.163 --> 01:03:15.963
God.

1660
01:03:15.963 --> 01:03:17.833
I'm used to standing
fucking ovations.


1661
01:03:17.833 --> 01:03:19.423
Sam's
extremely green.


1662
01:03:19.423 --> 01:03:21.028
Give her a break.
She's in menopause.


1663
01:03:21.028 --> 01:03:22.153
She's an idiot.

1664
01:03:22.153 --> 01:03:24.111
Yeah, it
kind of sucks being back.


1665
01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:32.503
We would love to
dedicate tonight's performance,


1666
01:03:32.503 --> 01:03:35.323
y'all, to somebody who is dead.

1667
01:03:36.283 --> 01:03:39.673
Our guy who is a part of
the community theater and we


1668
01:03:39.673 --> 01:03:40.493
love him.

1669
01:03:40.493 --> 01:03:41.293
He's dope.

1670
01:03:41.293 --> 01:03:44.503
Miles, we love you,
and we miss you.


1671
01:03:44.503 --> 01:03:45.433
Come back.

1672
01:03:45.433 --> 01:03:46.583
No, he can't.

1673
01:03:47.383 --> 01:03:50.493
But, Thimberly, we are
here with you, girl.


1674
01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:51.493
Oh, why!

1675
01:03:56.593 --> 01:03:58.423
No, I
mean, we can always


1676
01:03:58.423 --> 01:04:00.466
- change that blocking and stuff.
- Oh my god.


1677
01:04:00.466 --> 01:04:01.423
Paparazzi.
Is it Zac Efron?


1678
01:04:01.423 --> 01:04:02.548
Wait a second.

1679
01:04:02.548 --> 01:04:03.753
Is this for me?

1680
01:04:03.753 --> 01:04:04.663
Oh my God.

1681
01:04:04.663 --> 01:04:05.983
Oh my God, congrats.

1682
01:04:05.983 --> 01:04:06.918
Great preview.

1683
01:04:06.918 --> 01:04:08.293
It's a
start, you know.


1684
01:04:08.293 --> 01:04:09.373
What's this?

1685
01:04:09.373 --> 01:04:11.956
They're just doing
a story on my little theater.


1686
01:04:11.956 --> 01:04:13.123
Congratulations.

1687
01:04:13.123 --> 01:04:14.413
I'm Rudie.

1688
01:04:14.413 --> 01:04:15.551
Yeah, we've met.

1689
01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:16.843
She's here every day.

1690
01:04:16.843 --> 01:04:19.303
You know,
your hair looks so rad,


1691
01:04:19.303 --> 01:04:21.373
all piled up like a sea goddess.

1692
01:04:21.373 --> 01:04:22.273
Can I touch it?

1693
01:04:22.273 --> 01:04:24.403
Come on, I think
we should have stopped at rad.


1694
01:04:24.403 --> 01:04:25.772
No one stopped her?
No one stopped her?


1695
01:04:25.772 --> 01:04:26.574
No, we
should get out of here.


1696
01:04:26.574 --> 01:04:28.363
We're mucking up your
whole setup here.


1697
01:04:28.363 --> 01:04:30.523
Hey, great work on
everything, you guys.


1698
01:04:30.523 --> 01:04:31.931
You really nailed it today.

1699
01:04:31.931 --> 01:04:33.223
Big things for you.

1700
01:04:33.223 --> 01:04:34.123
Wow.

1701
01:04:34.123 --> 01:04:34.923
Thank you, Rudie.

1702
01:04:35.803 --> 01:04:37.543
Good job, Rudie.

1703
01:04:37.543 --> 01:04:39.173
R
-U
-D
-I
-E.

1704
01:04:39.173 --> 01:04:42.153
I really want you to
come see my show, Oil & Rancor.


1705
01:04:42.153 --> 01:04:43.153
It's at the Yellow Goat.

1706
01:04:43.153 --> 01:04:44.983
I would be
absolutely delighted to.


1707
01:04:44.983 --> 01:04:46.691
OK, great.
I'll put you on the list.


1708
01:04:46.691 --> 01:04:48.233
No, I want
to buy a ticket.


1709
01:04:48.233 --> 01:04:49.123
I want to support.

1710
01:04:49.123 --> 01:04:51.253
It's sold out.

1711
01:04:51.253 --> 01:04:53.033
I'll-- I'll throw
your name in the list.


1712
01:04:53.033 --> 01:04:53.833
Sold out?

1713
01:04:53.833 --> 01:04:54.808
That's so great.

1714
01:05:05.678 --> 01:05:07.303
I just
can't even freaking


1715
01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:09.283
believe that ghosts are real.

1716
01:05:09.283 --> 01:05:11.643
But they sure are.

1717
01:05:11.643 --> 01:05:13.165
Because I'm one.

1718
01:05:13.165 --> 01:05:14.373
We have a saying.

1719
01:05:14.373 --> 01:05:17.643
If there's a factory fire,
it's probably Tuesday.


1720
01:05:21.315 --> 01:05:26.265
I killed daddy!

1721
01:05:35.244 --> 01:05:36.744
Follow
me on Instagram.


1722
01:05:40.263 --> 01:05:41.403
Yes?

1723
01:05:41.403 --> 01:05:42.903
Are you
from Down South?


1724
01:05:42.903 --> 01:05:44.073
I love grits.

1725
01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:44.913
Does that count?

1726
01:05:48.393 --> 01:05:49.473
Yes?

1727
01:05:49.473 --> 01:05:51.093
I have a
question for you.


1728
01:05:51.093 --> 01:05:53.433
It seemed water wastey.

1729
01:05:53.433 --> 01:05:54.681
Are we not in a drought?

1730
01:05:54.681 --> 01:05:56.973
Did you
get the free tickets OK, Meg?


1731
01:05:56.973 --> 01:05:57.821
- Yeah.
- All the comps?


1732
01:05:57.821 --> 01:05:58.623
Yeah?
Good.


1733
01:05:58.623 --> 01:05:59.423
All right.

1734
01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:01.843
Any other questions from
anyone here tonight?


1735
01:06:01.843 --> 01:06:03.536
Anyone else?

1736
01:06:03.536 --> 01:06:04.338
Oh, that
guy has a question.


1737
01:06:05.138 --> 01:06:05.973
Mm-mm.

1738
01:06:05.973 --> 01:06:07.273
That's all
the time we have.


1739
01:06:07.273 --> 01:06:08.856
Thank you for
supporting live theater.


1740
01:06:08.856 --> 01:06:11.339
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1741
01:06:24.263 --> 01:06:25.453
This is such a relief.

1742
01:06:25.453 --> 01:06:26.848
I never get a female driver.

1743
01:06:29.973 --> 01:06:31.503
Interesting.

1744
01:06:31.503 --> 01:06:33.033
What's interesting?

1745
01:06:33.033 --> 01:06:37.623
Seems it would go
against the idea of feminism


1746
01:06:37.623 --> 01:06:42.243
to presuppose, huh, we have
the same values because


1747
01:06:42.243 --> 01:06:45.543
of our exterior appearance
or presumed plumbing,


1748
01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:48.990
even to assume, young lady,
that I'm not dangerous.


1749
01:06:48.990 --> 01:06:50.448
Yeah,
right here is good.


1750
01:06:51.513 --> 01:06:53.305
Where?

1751
01:06:53.305 --> 01:06:54.763
Um, just
really anywhere.


1752
01:06:54.763 --> 01:06:56.833
Not yet.

1753
01:06:56.833 --> 01:06:57.633
OK, look.

1754
01:06:57.633 --> 01:06:58.473
Right here.

1755
01:06:58.473 --> 01:06:59.293
What the?

1756
01:06:59.293 --> 01:07:00.603
- Oh my--
- That's right.


1757
01:07:00.603 --> 01:07:02.373
Cash, stolen guns.

1758
01:07:02.373 --> 01:07:03.453
Stolen guns.

1759
01:07:06.373 --> 01:07:08.103
Holy shit.

1760
01:07:08.103 --> 01:07:09.121
I'm terrified.

1761
01:07:09.121 --> 01:07:10.413
Of course you are.

1762
01:07:10.413 --> 01:07:12.051
I need to get
out of this car right now.


1763
01:07:12.051 --> 01:07:12.853
You don't.

1764
01:07:12.853 --> 01:07:13.653
OK.

1765
01:07:13.653 --> 01:07:15.223
I'm sorry that I felt safe.

1766
01:07:15.223 --> 01:07:16.893
I certainly take it back.

1767
01:07:16.893 --> 01:07:17.913
Where are we going?

1768
01:07:17.913 --> 01:07:19.663
I've got
a couple of errands.


1769
01:07:22.383 --> 01:07:24.981
Hey, just wanted to
take a quick picture,


1770
01:07:24.981 --> 01:07:25.992
just to prove that
I dropped you off.


1771
01:07:25.992 --> 01:07:26.793
What?

1772
01:07:27.594 --> 01:07:28.563
- Got it.
- You're psychotic.


1773
01:07:28.563 --> 01:07:29.763
There are privacy laws.

1774
01:07:29.763 --> 01:07:31.753
Bye!

1775
01:07:31.753 --> 01:07:32.553
Thank you.

1776
01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:36.343
Hey, Sam.

1777
01:07:36.343 --> 01:07:37.633
It's Greggy.

1778
01:07:37.633 --> 01:07:40.403
Listen, I heard you didn't get
any standing O's in previews?


1779
01:07:40.403 --> 01:07:41.203
Yikes.

1780
01:07:41.203 --> 01:07:42.943
Anyway, I told you, meet me.

1781
01:07:42.943 --> 01:07:44.203
Chess Cafe, OK?

1782
01:07:44.203 --> 01:07:46.123
I'm here most afternoons,
hanging out with


1783
01:07:46.123 --> 01:07:47.593
my new community of cool buds.

1784
01:08:25.695 --> 01:08:28.873
It was
a crisp summer day.


1785
01:08:28.873 --> 01:08:30.733
I was eating a plum.

1786
01:08:30.733 --> 01:08:34.672
Plums are sweet and nectary.

1787
01:08:34.672 --> 01:08:38.313
Where can you find a
plum tree in the city?


1788
01:08:38.313 --> 01:08:41.353
I've never seen one.

1789
01:08:41.353 --> 01:08:44.533
Yet in my childhood,
on a crisp summer day,


1790
01:08:44.533 --> 01:08:48.613
I did pluck the plums
and eat them slowly.


1791
01:08:48.613 --> 01:08:50.727
Plum!

1792
01:08:54.233 --> 01:08:58.523
The year is 8005.

1793
01:08:58.523 --> 01:09:01.882
A great plague is upon us.

1794
01:09:01.882 --> 01:09:04.002
I feel lost.

1795
01:09:04.002 --> 01:09:06.343
I am lost.

1796
01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:08.491
But aren't you?

1797
01:09:08.491 --> 01:09:09.423
Aren't we all?

1798
01:09:12.693 --> 01:09:14.573
Who could love me?

1799
01:09:14.573 --> 01:09:16.873
Who?

1800
01:09:16.873 --> 01:09:19.348
I've tried my whole life!

1801
01:09:25.323 --> 01:09:29.479
That's called America
as we know it.


1802
01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:33.231
Help!

1803
01:09:33.231 --> 01:09:36.721
Why aren't you helping me?

1804
01:09:36.721 --> 01:09:40.130
Don't look.

1805
01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:41.278
Help!

1806
01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:42.078
Oh!

1807
01:09:47.135 --> 01:09:51.252
Cords, so many cords!

1808
01:09:51.252 --> 01:09:53.882
My neck.

1809
01:09:53.882 --> 01:10:00.043
my spine, my ass,
surrounded by cords!


1810
01:10:00.043 --> 01:10:03.283
I can't escape the cords!

1811
01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:06.228
Everywhere I go-- cords.

1812
01:10:35.865 --> 01:10:39.913
Y'all,
sit down, sit down.


1813
01:10:39.913 --> 01:10:44.173
I wrote this play for
my soul, for your soul,


1814
01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:47.323
for your soul, your soul,
for all of our souls.


1815
01:10:47.323 --> 01:10:48.913
Theater is connection.

1816
01:10:48.913 --> 01:10:50.443
Art is connection.

1817
01:10:50.443 --> 01:10:54.793
And I believe that I was put
on this earth to connect.


1818
01:10:54.793 --> 01:10:58.963
Every single one of y'all
in this audience is tribe.


1819
01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:01.603
And the vibe is
always for the tribe.


1820
01:11:01.603 --> 01:11:03.073
You know what I'm saying?

1821
01:11:03.073 --> 01:11:07.183
And on that note, white
theater with a capital W,


1822
01:11:07.183 --> 01:11:09.463
your day has come and gone.

1823
01:11:09.463 --> 01:11:10.263
Sorry.

1824
01:11:20.203 --> 01:11:21.673
Star!

1825
01:11:21.673 --> 01:11:23.293
A plum is juicy.

1826
01:11:23.293 --> 01:11:25.003
Plum!

1827
01:11:25.003 --> 01:11:25.843
Oh my God.

1828
01:11:25.843 --> 01:11:27.238
You're a genius!

1829
01:11:27.238 --> 01:11:28.113
Thank you.

1830
01:11:28.113 --> 01:11:29.946
Oh, I should
have got you flowers.


1831
01:11:29.946 --> 01:11:30.940
You crushed it.

1832
01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.023
Oh, no worries.

1833
01:11:32.023 --> 01:11:33.963
I'm actually on my
way out the door.


1834
01:11:33.963 --> 01:11:35.563
Me and the cast are
going to go party.


1835
01:11:35.563 --> 01:11:36.605
Oh, that's fun.

1836
01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:42.163
What do you put in the water
here, and can you bottle it?


1837
01:11:42.163 --> 01:11:44.568
I'll take 245 bottles, please.

1838
01:11:44.568 --> 01:11:45.943
That's the capacity
of the Regis.


1839
01:11:45.943 --> 01:11:47.173
Oh, stop it.

1840
01:11:47.173 --> 01:11:49.073
Your show is so good.

1841
01:11:49.073 --> 01:11:52.003
I've never gotten a
standing O like that before.


1842
01:11:52.003 --> 01:11:53.093
That was so magical.

1843
01:11:53.093 --> 01:11:55.093
Oh, well, you
know, you can't measure


1844
01:11:55.093 --> 01:11:56.473
yourself on that type of crap.

1845
01:11:56.473 --> 01:11:58.913
I can, and I do.

1846
01:11:58.913 --> 01:11:59.713
Sorry.

1847
01:11:59.713 --> 01:12:00.513
It's your night.

1848
01:12:00.513 --> 01:12:01.656
It's not about all this.

1849
01:12:01.656 --> 01:12:02.739
It is my night.

1850
01:12:02.739 --> 01:12:04.493
It was so amazing.

1851
01:12:04.493 --> 01:12:06.113
I literally feel like a queen.

1852
01:12:06.113 --> 01:12:08.903
Everyone was clapping so much--
clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.


1853
01:12:08.903 --> 01:12:10.463
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.
It was so loud.


1854
01:12:10.463 --> 01:12:12.833
It's like my ears are still
ringing from the clap,


1855
01:12:12.833 --> 01:12:14.153
clap, clap, clap, clap, clap.

1856
01:12:14.153 --> 01:12:15.683
I mean, you felt it.

1857
01:12:15.683 --> 01:12:17.573
Yes, I
was-- it was loud.


1858
01:12:17.573 --> 01:12:18.573
It was crazy.

1859
01:12:18.573 --> 01:12:19.990
It's
incredible that you


1860
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:22.073
have your own crowd
that came out and just


1861
01:12:22.073 --> 01:12:24.008
supports you like that.

1862
01:12:24.008 --> 01:12:25.883
The Regis
has a built-in audience.


1863
01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:27.803
I feel like you got
your own crowd too.


1864
01:12:27.803 --> 01:12:29.633
I know, but
white theater's over


1865
01:12:29.633 --> 01:12:31.613
so I guess I need a new job.

1866
01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:32.903
Oh.

1867
01:12:32.903 --> 01:12:34.253
You took that personal?

1868
01:12:34.253 --> 01:12:35.783
No, I'm
kidding with you.


1869
01:12:35.783 --> 01:12:38.963
I said white theater
with a capital W. Yeah, I


1870
01:12:38.963 --> 01:12:41.063
felt comfortable
enough in the moment


1871
01:12:41.063 --> 01:12:43.013
to express the sentiment
that the theater


1872
01:12:43.013 --> 01:12:44.633
establishment is musty.

1873
01:12:44.633 --> 01:12:45.575
I didn't say you.

1874
01:12:45.575 --> 01:12:47.783
I don't even know
how we got on this topic.


1875
01:12:47.783 --> 01:12:51.783
You were mad I got
a standing O. Remember that?


1876
01:12:51.783 --> 01:12:54.353
Yeah, because if you never
get one, that's on you, love.


1877
01:12:54.353 --> 01:12:55.313
Whoa.
Come on.


1878
01:12:55.313 --> 01:12:56.493
I'm not trying to
make this about me.


1879
01:12:56.493 --> 01:12:58.076
I'm just in this
weird situation where


1880
01:12:58.076 --> 01:12:59.963
everyone's comparing
me to this man


1881
01:12:59.963 --> 01:13:02.013
who has 20 years of experience.

1882
01:13:02.013 --> 01:13:03.233
And it's not fair, like.

1883
01:13:03.233 --> 01:13:04.441
OK, you know what?

1884
01:13:04.441 --> 01:13:07.223
I don't feel supported
in this visit.


1885
01:13:07.223 --> 01:13:09.653
Yeah, this-- this is draining.

1886
01:13:09.653 --> 01:13:10.736
You have some blind spots.

1887
01:13:10.736 --> 01:13:11.536
Me?

1888
01:13:11.536 --> 01:13:12.743
Yeah.

1889
01:13:12.743 --> 01:13:14.063
Big time.

1890
01:13:14.063 --> 01:13:15.911
If you feel anything
less than grateful


1891
01:13:15.911 --> 01:13:17.453
for an opportunity
that was literally


1892
01:13:17.453 --> 01:13:21.023
plopped into your lap,
you got to reconsider.


1893
01:13:21.023 --> 01:13:22.773
I'm not the person to
talk to about this.


1894
01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:23.573
What?

1895
01:13:23.573 --> 01:13:24.683
I mean, come on.

1896
01:13:24.683 --> 01:13:26.843
I-- what-- what can I
do to be better, then?


1897
01:13:26.843 --> 01:13:29.063
It actually
reminds me of this joke.


1898
01:13:29.063 --> 01:13:31.613
What's the difference between
a thoughtful white person


1899
01:13:31.613 --> 01:13:32.973
and a thoughtless white person?

1900
01:13:32.973 --> 01:13:33.773
What?

1901
01:13:33.773 --> 01:13:35.631
Nothing.

1902
01:13:35.631 --> 01:13:37.673
I should have learned my
lesson with Lena Dunham,


1903
01:13:37.673 --> 01:13:40.277
but I simply love Girls.

1904
01:13:44.073 --> 01:13:47.023
For what it's
worth, I didn't love her play.


1905
01:13:47.023 --> 01:13:49.623
But I thought
it was just so good.


1906
01:13:49.623 --> 01:13:50.945
Of course you did.

1907
01:13:53.021 --> 01:13:54.563
Thank you
for understanding


1908
01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:56.521
that I'm going to need
you to pay up front now.


1909
01:13:56.521 --> 01:13:57.623
Yeah.

1910
01:13:57.623 --> 01:14:00.713
So I saw Star's play
and just-- boom,


1911
01:14:00.713 --> 01:14:02.663
standing ovation right away.

1912
01:14:02.663 --> 01:14:04.703
I'm like, what am I doing?

1913
01:14:04.703 --> 01:14:06.523
I feel like I have
nothing to say.


1914
01:14:06.523 --> 01:14:08.148
You're
having a breakthrough.


1915
01:14:08.148 --> 01:14:09.181
I am?

1916
01:14:09.181 --> 01:14:10.723
You don't
have much to say.


1917
01:14:10.723 --> 01:14:12.098
Well,
let me say this--


1918
01:14:12.098 --> 01:14:14.700
give me all my
money back, addict!


1919
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:15.783
I don't have it.

1920
01:14:15.783 --> 01:14:16.583
What?

1921
01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:17.909
I spent it.

1922
01:14:17.909 --> 01:14:19.623
Sam, I have a
gambling addiction.


1923
01:14:19.623 --> 01:14:20.583
Good god.

1924
01:14:20.583 --> 01:14:22.488
I never I was perfect!

1925
01:14:22.488 --> 01:14:24.603
I-- I do
have something to say.


1926
01:14:24.603 --> 01:14:25.473
Ow.

1927
01:14:25.473 --> 01:14:27.093
You hurt my hand!

1928
01:14:27.093 --> 01:14:27.893
OK.

1929
01:14:27.893 --> 01:14:29.393
OK, you
need to pay for this.


1930
01:14:29.393 --> 01:14:30.435
Oh my goodness.

1931
01:14:30.435 --> 01:14:32.551
I fucking paid at the beginning.

1932
01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:34.043
That is my bad.
You did.


1933
01:14:34.043 --> 01:14:35.003
I apologize.

1934
01:14:35.003 --> 01:14:36.623
Please excuse me.

1935
01:14:36.623 --> 01:14:39.563
I have to step away
from this, for I


1936
01:14:39.563 --> 01:14:42.593
must attend opening night
of my directorial debut


1937
01:14:42.593 --> 01:14:43.468
at the Regis Theater.

1938
01:14:43.468 --> 01:14:45.468
Sounds like you
don't need me anymore.


1939
01:14:45.468 --> 01:14:47.003
I guess I'll just
jump off a bridge.


1940
01:14:47.003 --> 01:14:49.009
Meg!

1941
01:15:15.421 --> 01:15:19.943
No, daddy.
No.


1942
01:15:19.943 --> 01:15:21.023
Hey, guys.

1943
01:15:21.023 --> 01:15:24.173
Slap looks fantastic.

1944
01:15:24.173 --> 01:15:27.541
Corden, it's been so nice
having you back at the Regis.


1945
01:15:27.541 --> 01:15:30.083
Oh, I told you I'd
be back as long as you let me


1946
01:15:30.083 --> 01:15:31.375
miss almost all the rehearsals.

1947
01:15:31.375 --> 01:15:33.233
And you're
a man of your word.


1948
01:15:33.233 --> 01:15:34.553
- Now, mama.
- Yeah.


1949
01:15:34.553 --> 01:15:35.353
Papa.

1950
01:15:35.353 --> 01:15:40.853
My vet and my pro, I've got a
new monologue for each of you.


1951
01:15:40.853 --> 01:15:42.398
On opening night?

1952
01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:51.703
Enjoy the show.

1953
01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:01.927
Let's do
this warm-up for Miles.


1954
01:16:01.927 --> 01:16:02.729
Hell yeah.

1955
01:16:02.729 --> 01:16:03.901
Love you, Miles.

1956
01:16:03.901 --> 01:16:05.269
I feel you here.

1957
01:16:05.269 --> 01:16:07.085
What's coming in?

1958
01:16:07.085 --> 01:16:08.308
Rain's coming in.

1959
01:16:36.563 --> 01:16:37.363
Hmm.

1960
01:16:37.363 --> 01:16:43.033
This world, I see it
with new eyes now--


1961
01:16:43.033 --> 01:16:48.223
white privilege,
infrastructure designed


1962
01:16:48.223 --> 01:16:53.413
to support us while
cutting the other out


1963
01:16:53.413 --> 01:16:57.103
of the American dream.

1964
01:16:57.103 --> 01:17:00.603
Generational wealth!

1965
01:17:00.603 --> 01:17:08.773
And don't you even get me
started on so-called illegals.


1966
01:17:08.773 --> 01:17:09.573
Hmph.

1967
01:17:09.573 --> 01:17:15.208
You know who the biggest
illegal of all was, don't you?


1968
01:17:15.208 --> 01:17:21.363
why, Mr. Christopher Columbus.

1969
01:17:21.363 --> 01:17:27.363
Capitalism chews
up and spits out the have-nots.


1970
01:17:27.363 --> 01:17:28.623
And for what?

1971
01:17:28.623 --> 01:17:30.933
The almighty dollar.

1972
01:17:30.933 --> 01:17:33.393
Yeah, just look at our--

1973
01:17:33.393 --> 01:17:39.123
our public school systems and
the prison industrial complex.


1974
01:17:39.123 --> 01:17:41.983
Yeah, that's a great example.

1975
01:17:41.983 --> 01:17:44.343
And it's-- it's all by design.

1976
01:17:44.343 --> 01:17:47.548
So think about that.

1977
01:17:58.267 --> 01:18:01.243
I love advertising.

1978
01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:06.753
It's about balance, something
I never had in this house.


1979
01:18:06.753 --> 01:18:09.358
Because you tore through this
family like a factory fire,


1980
01:18:09.358 --> 01:18:10.158
Mama.

1981
01:18:13.703 --> 01:18:19.283
I may be a
ghost, but I'm still here!


1982
01:18:19.283 --> 01:18:25.823
Oh, the wrath of
those I bore and those I raised


1983
01:18:25.823 --> 01:18:32.843
is like a weight tied
to my torso, dragging me


1984
01:18:32.843 --> 01:18:41.449
and all my good intentions
downward toward oblivion.


1985
01:18:44.683 --> 01:18:47.555
Rain's coming in.

1986
01:18:50.683 --> 01:18:54.613
Shame,
shame on your fake rain!


1987
01:18:54.613 --> 01:18:58.603
Shame, shame on your fake rain!

1988
01:18:58.603 --> 01:19:00.463
We are in a water crisis.

1989
01:19:05.673 --> 01:19:07.959
Oh, dinner's ready.

1990
01:19:07.959 --> 01:19:10.103
Mama, we ought to invite Buck.

1991
01:19:10.103 --> 01:19:12.023
Lillie Mae's sweet on him.

1992
01:19:12.023 --> 01:19:16.246
Oh, my husband
Buck, the-- the father


1993
01:19:16.246 --> 01:19:18.073
of my unborn child!

1994
01:19:18.073 --> 01:19:21.575
And, yes, I am pregnant!

1995
01:19:21.575 --> 01:19:23.539
Buck!

1996
01:19:26.493 --> 01:19:29.193
Shame,
shame, shame, shame.


1997
01:19:30.018 --> 01:19:36.063
Shame, shame, shame,
shame, shame, shame, shame,


1998
01:19:36.063 --> 01:19:43.033
shame, shame, shame,
shame, shame, shame, shame,


1999
01:19:43.033 --> 01:19:46.913
shame, shame, shame, shame!

2000
01:19:53.673 --> 01:19:54.673
Yeah, yeah.

2001
01:19:54.673 --> 01:19:56.170
Fuck you!

2002
01:19:58.166 --> 01:20:03.655
Shame, shame,
shame, shame, shame, shame,


2003
01:20:03.655 --> 01:20:08.344
shame, shame, shame, shame.

2004
01:20:08.344 --> 01:20:09.144
Oh!

2005
01:20:13.963 --> 01:20:16.463
Ow!

2006
01:20:16.463 --> 01:20:19.373
How do you have so much
paint in this theater?


2007
01:20:19.373 --> 01:20:20.663
I don't get it.

2008
01:20:20.663 --> 01:20:22.581
But I want to thank our
season ticket holders


2009
01:20:22.581 --> 01:20:23.873
because you make this possible.

2010
01:20:23.873 --> 01:20:25.956
When it's good, you
make that possible.


2011
01:20:25.956 --> 01:20:27.623
I thank you from the
bottom of my heart,


2012
01:20:27.623 --> 01:20:30.408
and I want you to know
your hard-earned cash


2013
01:20:30.408 --> 01:20:31.283
isn't going to waste.

2014
01:20:31.283 --> 01:20:35.003
The Q&A is still on!

2015
01:20:35.003 --> 01:20:38.453
It was a colorful
evening, obviously.


2016
01:20:38.453 --> 01:20:40.463
But, yeah, does
anyone have a question


2017
01:20:40.463 --> 01:20:42.563
for any of these
brilliant souls up here?


2018
01:20:42.563 --> 01:20:44.253
Let's focus on the work.

2019
01:20:44.253 --> 01:20:45.803
Let's focus on the work, huh?

2020
01:20:45.803 --> 01:20:48.473
Sam, you've
admitted yourself publicly


2021
01:20:48.473 --> 01:20:49.683
that you're not Southern.

2022
01:20:49.683 --> 01:20:50.483
OK.

2023
01:20:50.483 --> 01:20:53.213
So at a time when
authenticity reigns supreme,


2024
01:20:53.213 --> 01:20:55.493
you are inauthentic.

2025
01:20:55.493 --> 01:20:56.363
Why?

2026
01:20:56.363 --> 01:20:57.643
What
can she do, right?


2027
01:20:57.643 --> 01:20:59.518
She's supposed to write
a play about a writer


2028
01:20:59.518 --> 01:21:00.623
who becomes a director?

2029
01:21:00.623 --> 01:21:01.853
And
then directs that?


2030
01:21:01.853 --> 01:21:02.653
Man.

2031
01:21:02.653 --> 01:21:04.283
I think that'd be
a hall of mirrors.


2032
01:21:06.233 --> 01:21:07.977
Who wrote
Peter Pan, a pirate?


2033
01:21:07.977 --> 01:21:08.779
Think about it.

2034
01:21:08.779 --> 01:21:10.878
Martin McDonagh wrote a
whole movie about Missouri


2035
01:21:10.878 --> 01:21:11.753
from across the pond.

2036
01:21:11.753 --> 01:21:15.643
Or the dream-- he wrote
Single Ladies, and he's a man!


2037
01:21:15.643 --> 01:21:18.143
All right, they've
been working really hard to put


2038
01:21:18.143 --> 01:21:19.351
on a great show for you guys.

2039
01:21:19.351 --> 01:21:20.423
They really have, OK?

2040
01:21:20.423 --> 01:21:22.943
So they would love
a question, in spite


2041
01:21:22.943 --> 01:21:26.093
of all the weird setbacks with
environmentalists apparently


2042
01:21:26.093 --> 01:21:28.463
just kind of pegging
me and Clara, which


2043
01:21:28.463 --> 01:21:30.113
is sort of sexist in a way.

2044
01:21:30.113 --> 01:21:31.073
Weird.

2045
01:21:31.073 --> 01:21:32.283
Sexist environmentalists.

2046
01:21:32.283 --> 01:21:33.583
- OK.
- What's up, man?


2047
01:21:33.583 --> 01:21:34.458
Hello, sir.

2048
01:21:34.458 --> 01:21:35.293
Here.

2049
01:21:35.293 --> 01:21:36.273
Oh, oh.

2050
01:21:36.273 --> 01:21:38.123
I'm not sexist.

2051
01:21:38.123 --> 01:21:39.203
Oh.

2052
01:21:39.203 --> 01:21:41.708
Thanks, Sam.

2053
01:21:41.708 --> 01:21:42.536
Oh, wait.

2054
01:21:42.536 --> 01:21:43.703
I really do have a question.

2055
01:21:43.703 --> 01:21:45.353
Where is this play set?

2056
01:21:45.353 --> 01:21:46.523
The Deep South.

2057
01:21:46.523 --> 01:21:48.203
No, you cannot ask a question.

2058
01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:49.673
Yeah, you don't
get a question, honeybun!


2059
01:21:49.673 --> 01:21:51.773
Well, it's
clearly a fictional location


2060
01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:54.863
with conflicting cultural
and geographical references


2061
01:21:54.863 --> 01:21:56.573
and accents and costumes.

2062
01:21:56.573 --> 01:21:58.163
Ugh,
you coastal elites,


2063
01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:01.073
you love our cracker barrels
and our Southern plays


2064
01:22:01.073 --> 01:22:03.113
and our need for jet
skis and ferrets,


2065
01:22:03.113 --> 01:22:05.063
but you sneer at
rural values when


2066
01:22:05.063 --> 01:22:06.373
you get in the voting booth.

2067
01:22:06.373 --> 01:22:08.633
OK, I'd
rather not enter a full


2068
01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:10.313
political discussion right now.

2069
01:22:10.313 --> 01:22:11.787
Oh,
watch whiteness work.


2070
01:22:11.787 --> 01:22:12.589
What does that mean?

2071
01:22:12.589 --> 01:22:15.053
Why don't you treat
water as a precious resource?


2072
01:22:15.053 --> 01:22:16.803
My God,
look at all the water


2073
01:22:16.803 --> 01:22:18.873
coming up and down my tits!

2074
01:22:18.873 --> 01:22:21.623
Oh, go, go, go, go, go.

2075
01:22:21.623 --> 01:22:23.823
Why
isn't grief linear?


2076
01:22:23.823 --> 01:22:27.563
Why does it spin relentlessly
around like a tornado?


2077
01:22:27.563 --> 01:22:29.183
Why are you a Jew?

2078
01:22:29.183 --> 01:22:30.814
Why did
you sleep with me?


2079
01:22:30.814 --> 01:22:31.616
Really?

2080
01:22:31.616 --> 01:22:32.778
I'm
your subordinate


2081
01:22:32.778 --> 01:22:33.863
in a professional setting.

2082
01:22:33.863 --> 01:22:35.030
Well, I was drunk!

2083
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:36.263
You know I was drunk.

2084
01:22:36.263 --> 01:22:37.063
That's why.

2085
01:22:37.063 --> 01:22:39.413
That's why I would sleep with
you, because I was drunk.


2086
01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:40.993
Booze hound!

2087
01:22:40.993 --> 01:22:42.473
Sam, not an usher.

2088
01:22:42.473 --> 01:22:43.763
Oh, OK, Greggy.

2089
01:22:43.763 --> 01:22:44.563
She fucked Greggy.

2090
01:22:44.563 --> 01:22:45.363
Yeah.

2091
01:22:45.363 --> 01:22:46.313
Yeah, she did.

2092
01:22:46.313 --> 01:22:47.639
To bring that here.

2093
01:22:47.639 --> 01:22:48.597
Apologize!

2094
01:22:48.597 --> 01:22:49.583
Apologize.

2095
01:22:49.583 --> 01:22:52.463
Apologize,
apologize, apologize.


2096
01:22:52.463 --> 01:22:53.593
Oh, oh!

2097
01:22:53.593 --> 01:22:55.213
Apologize, apologize!

2098
01:22:55.213 --> 01:22:57.073
Don't
listen to them, Sam!


2099
01:22:57.073 --> 01:22:59.073
All right,
Greggy, that's not helping.


2100
01:22:59.073 --> 01:22:59.873
All right?

2101
01:22:59.873 --> 01:23:01.260
That's not helping.

2102
01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:03.645
You're not even supposed
to be in this building.


2103
01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:08.892
Apologize,
apologize, apologize!


2104
01:23:08.892 --> 01:23:11.691
For what?

2105
01:23:11.691 --> 01:23:14.563
What do you want me
to apologize for?


2106
01:23:14.563 --> 01:23:18.813
You ever think about that?

2107
01:23:23.073 --> 01:23:24.283
You ever think about that?

2108
01:23:28.893 --> 01:23:31.053
What do you want me
to apologize for?


2109
01:23:31.053 --> 01:23:33.963
I can't even hear each thing!

2110
01:23:33.963 --> 01:23:37.473
You want me to apologize because
I wasn't thinking about water?


2111
01:23:37.473 --> 01:23:39.963
Because I fucked
some weird psycho?


2112
01:23:39.963 --> 01:23:41.043
Because I'm not Southern?

2113
01:23:41.043 --> 01:23:42.333
Sorry.
Sorry.


2114
01:23:42.333 --> 01:23:43.183
I'm a Jew.

2115
01:23:43.183 --> 01:23:43.983
Help.

2116
01:23:43.983 --> 01:23:45.693
I'm drowning in
white woman tears.


2117
01:23:45.693 --> 01:23:47.913
- Jews aren't white.
- They are to me.


2118
01:23:47.913 --> 01:23:49.653
You think
I don't know I suck?


2119
01:23:49.653 --> 01:23:50.553
I suck.

2120
01:23:50.553 --> 01:23:51.963
I know that.

2121
01:23:51.963 --> 01:23:54.261
And this is a group
of basic amateurs.


2122
01:23:55.063 --> 01:23:55.863
Basic?

2123
01:23:55.863 --> 01:23:57.933
Yeah, who are probably
going to-- let's be frank.


2124
01:23:57.933 --> 01:23:59.932
They're going to live and
die on this shitty stage.


2125
01:23:59.932 --> 01:24:00.734
Hey!

2126
01:24:00.734 --> 01:24:02.058
Yeah,
I don't know--


2127
01:24:02.058 --> 01:24:03.063
But I tried.

2128
01:24:03.063 --> 01:24:05.673
I tried, and no one's happy.

2129
01:24:05.673 --> 01:24:07.923
I can barely pay my rent.

2130
01:24:07.923 --> 01:24:10.443
I don't know whose dream
this is, but it's not mine.


2131
01:24:10.443 --> 01:24:11.883
I just realized that right now.

2132
01:24:11.883 --> 01:24:13.113
It's not mine.

2133
01:24:13.113 --> 01:24:15.803
Caring is
one piece of the puzzle.


2134
01:24:15.803 --> 01:24:17.453
Talent is another.

2135
01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:19.524
Then you write
a fucking play, Rudie!


2136
01:24:19.524 --> 01:24:20.324
OK.

2137
01:24:20.324 --> 01:24:21.124
That's it.

2138
01:24:21.124 --> 01:24:23.693
Yeah, you can write
it with this stupid audience!


2139
01:24:23.693 --> 01:24:25.776
Sheldon, are
you going to do anything?


2140
01:24:25.776 --> 01:24:27.273
Shut up, Clara!

2141
01:24:27.273 --> 01:24:29.393
There's no one
waiting in the wings.


2142
01:24:29.393 --> 01:24:32.853
There's no man who's going to
come out and fucking save you.


2143
01:24:32.853 --> 01:24:33.653
Do you get it?

2144
01:24:33.653 --> 01:24:35.127
You're being
scary girl right now.


2145
01:24:35.127 --> 01:24:35.929
I know.
I'm going to shut down.


2146
01:24:35.929 --> 01:24:38.453
Sheldon is not
coming, because Sheldon's


2147
01:24:38.453 --> 01:24:39.893
a fucking pussy.

2148
01:24:39.893 --> 01:24:41.063
But no one sees that.

2149
01:24:41.063 --> 01:24:46.023
Because if anyone in this
entire theater is a pussy,


2150
01:24:46.023 --> 01:24:47.403
Sheldon is a pussy.

2151
01:24:47.403 --> 01:24:49.620
Sheldon is a pussy!

2152
01:24:57.543 --> 01:24:58.543
It's over.

2153
01:24:58.543 --> 01:25:00.193
We've reached an impasse.

2154
01:25:00.193 --> 01:25:01.553
Great.

2155
01:25:01.553 --> 01:25:03.720
Don't think
I forgot how you flirted


2156
01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:06.143
with Miles, ogling
his muscles, begging


2157
01:25:06.143 --> 01:25:07.943
him to fatally exert himself.

2158
01:25:07.943 --> 01:25:09.623
Please
understand, I had zero


2159
01:25:09.623 --> 01:25:10.883
attraction to your husband.

2160
01:25:10.883 --> 01:25:12.773
He is
out of your league.


2161
01:25:12.773 --> 01:25:16.493
Wouldn't have touched you with
a 10-foot pole, which he had,


2162
01:25:16.493 --> 01:25:19.383
by the way.

2163
01:25:19.383 --> 01:25:22.353
Trust is
broken, and maybe you are too.


2164
01:25:22.353 --> 01:25:23.773
Oh, maybe so.

2165
01:25:23.773 --> 01:25:24.573
Yeah.

2166
01:25:24.573 --> 01:25:27.873
In brighter news,
someone familiar with the play


2167
01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:30.393
has graciously thrown
his hat into the ring.


2168
01:25:30.393 --> 01:25:31.830
Oh, who, pray tell?

2169
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:32.663
Rudie.

2170
01:25:32.663 --> 01:25:34.000
Oh, perfect.

2171
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.583
We
felt it made sense.


2172
01:25:35.583 --> 01:25:36.423
Did ya?

2173
01:25:36.423 --> 01:25:38.703
Maybe tell Rudie that
actors are not hyenas


2174
01:25:38.703 --> 01:25:41.193
or whatever mythical
shit you ascribe to them.


2175
01:25:41.193 --> 01:25:44.553
They're just very stupid people.

2176
01:25:44.553 --> 01:25:45.813
I see.

2177
01:25:45.813 --> 01:25:47.523
Everything is the man's fault.

2178
01:25:47.523 --> 01:25:48.723
In this case, yes.

2179
01:25:48.723 --> 01:25:50.713
No,
look inward, Sam.


2180
01:25:50.713 --> 01:25:51.513
I do.

2181
01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:54.093
I go to therapy every
week with one of the best


2182
01:25:54.093 --> 01:25:55.473
therapists in this country.

2183
01:25:55.473 --> 01:25:58.533
And this is where it brought
me, this shitty fucking office.


2184
01:25:58.533 --> 01:25:59.613
I hated this job.

2185
01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:01.383
And this trophy, I've
been looking at it.


2186
01:26:01.383 --> 01:26:03.987
I fucking hate it.

2187
01:26:03.987 --> 01:26:04.983
Eh!

2188
01:26:04.983 --> 01:26:05.973
Gah!

2189
01:26:05.973 --> 01:26:08.193
Can't even
knock over a trophy.


2190
01:26:08.193 --> 01:26:10.083
I fucking
hate this place.


2191
01:26:10.083 --> 01:26:11.463
I quit.

2192
01:26:11.463 --> 01:26:13.659
You're fired.

2193
01:26:50.023 --> 01:26:53.863
Sam,
you finally made it.


2194
01:26:53.863 --> 01:26:56.083
How do you like my new office?

2195
01:26:56.083 --> 01:26:57.293
It's kind of gross.

2196
01:26:57.293 --> 01:26:58.453
These
are some of my buddies


2197
01:26:58.453 --> 01:26:59.620
who have also made mistakes.

2198
01:27:02.473 --> 01:27:06.560
You're one of us now,
one of the outcasts.


2199
01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.393
I'm sorry.

2200
01:27:07.393 --> 01:27:08.983
Are there no levels here?

2201
01:27:08.983 --> 01:27:12.103
Everyone's just clumped together
with me, a woman who had


2202
01:27:12.103 --> 01:27:14.893
a minor outburst at a theater?

2203
01:27:14.893 --> 01:27:17.113
Protesters
got you ruffled, huh?


2204
01:27:17.113 --> 01:27:19.323
I see you're wearing all black.

2205
01:27:19.323 --> 01:27:22.833
Are you in mourning
for your life?


2206
01:27:23.633 --> 01:27:24.743
Yeah.

2207
01:27:24.743 --> 01:27:27.263
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

2208
01:27:27.263 --> 01:27:28.423
It's over.

2209
01:27:28.423 --> 01:27:29.293
I'm out.

2210
01:27:29.293 --> 01:27:30.823
Rudie's directing.

2211
01:27:30.823 --> 01:27:32.083
Rudie?

2212
01:27:32.083 --> 01:27:33.763
He's great, very competent.

2213
01:27:33.763 --> 01:27:35.773
He has zero
directing experience.


2214
01:27:35.773 --> 01:27:37.923
But
he seems competent.


2215
01:27:37.923 --> 01:27:40.173
You know what I do when I
feel low, when I feel down?


2216
01:27:40.173 --> 01:27:43.963
I just meditate on all
those standing O's.


2217
01:27:44.763 --> 01:27:45.633
Oh, hey.

2218
01:27:45.633 --> 01:27:49.293
I have got some exciting news
in the Greggy Land department.


2219
01:27:49.293 --> 01:27:50.158
What?

2220
01:27:50.158 --> 01:27:53.623
I think I
finagled myself a gig with--


2221
01:27:53.623 --> 01:27:56.543
drum roll-
- Nickelodeon.

2222
01:27:56.543 --> 01:27:57.343
What?

2223
01:27:57.343 --> 01:27:59.343
Maybe
I'll put in a word.


2224
01:27:59.343 --> 01:28:01.343
That would be
so huge for me right now


2225
01:28:01.343 --> 01:28:04.469
if you would really do that.

2226
01:28:04.469 --> 01:28:06.413
Got you.

2227
01:28:06.413 --> 01:28:07.213
Thanks.

2228
01:28:10.823 --> 01:28:12.323
Hey,
can I put my hands


2229
01:28:12.323 --> 01:28:13.943
on both sides of your butt?

2230
01:28:13.943 --> 01:28:16.323
I'm doing this book
about butt measurements.


2231
01:28:16.323 --> 01:28:17.123
And I think--

2232
01:28:17.123 --> 01:28:18.143
I'm an idiot.

2233
01:28:18.143 --> 01:28:20.073
Desperation, and you
smelled it on me.


2234
01:28:20.073 --> 01:28:20.873
Of course.

2235
01:28:23.153 --> 01:28:24.203
Don't salute me.

2236
01:28:24.203 --> 01:28:26.475
Fucking weirdos, you
ruin people's lives.


2237
01:28:26.475 --> 01:28:28.433
Hey, the
book is legit, all right?


2238
01:28:28.433 --> 01:28:30.228
And I'm serious
about Nickelodeon.


2239
01:28:30.228 --> 01:28:31.028
Sam!

2240
01:28:36.783 --> 01:28:37.893
Rudie rules.

2241
01:28:37.893 --> 01:28:38.883
I love him.

2242
01:28:38.883 --> 01:28:39.993
I love the confidence.

2243
01:28:39.993 --> 01:28:41.043
Sorry.

2244
01:28:41.043 --> 01:28:42.183
With
Rudie, it feels right.


2245
01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:43.893
I just have to say that.
It just does.


2246
01:28:43.893 --> 01:28:45.993
It's so automatic, so organic.

2247
01:28:45.993 --> 01:28:50.223
We're like Laurel and Hardy,
just two total freaks.


2248
01:28:50.223 --> 01:28:52.153
The
woman has lost power.


2249
01:28:52.153 --> 01:28:54.003
The man is in power.

2250
01:28:54.003 --> 01:28:55.773
And everyone is happy.

2251
01:28:55.773 --> 01:28:59.323
Rudie doesn't
care how people see him.


2252
01:28:59.323 --> 01:29:01.273
I like that.

2253
01:29:01.273 --> 01:29:03.633
You don't care about people.

2254
01:29:03.633 --> 01:29:05.473
That's my shit.

2255
01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:06.843
Yeah, he's a--

2256
01:29:06.843 --> 01:29:08.133
he's an alpha.

2257
01:29:08.133 --> 01:29:09.843
Objectively, that's
better for the play,


2258
01:29:09.843 --> 01:29:12.333
if you believe in objectivity.

2259
01:29:12.333 --> 01:29:14.943
I don't.

2260
01:29:14.943 --> 01:29:16.563
I'm going to go
be in Star's play.


2261
01:29:16.563 --> 01:29:19.233
She's special, you know?

2262
01:29:19.233 --> 01:29:23.408
She lets there be water
where Rudie is brick.


2263
01:29:23.408 --> 01:29:25.033
Can't build a house
with brick, but you


2264
01:29:25.033 --> 01:29:27.133
can build a lake with water.

2265
01:29:31.863 --> 01:29:35.903
I just realized I
have K in my pocket.


2266
01:29:35.903 --> 01:29:38.813
Why did I take over?

2267
01:29:38.813 --> 01:29:41.363
Why does a wild dog
attack a water buffalo?


2268
01:29:43.883 --> 01:29:47.348
It's not my fault Sam
is weak or like a mom.


2269
01:29:50.003 --> 01:29:54.703
Don't act like I'm the only
person who hates their mother.


2270
01:29:54.703 --> 01:29:58.028
Most people do.

2271
01:29:58.028 --> 01:29:58.953
Hmm.

2272
01:29:58.953 --> 01:30:00.653
They brought us into this mess.

2273
01:30:00.653 --> 01:30:02.963
What was the game plan?

2274
01:30:02.963 --> 01:30:05.333
I mean, literally everything
bad that happens to us


2275
01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:08.043
is their fault.

2276
01:30:08.043 --> 01:30:12.123
I'm a Republican.

2277
01:30:20.133 --> 01:30:25.963
I don't need a
mother, one to call my own.


2278
01:30:25.963 --> 01:30:31.168
I don't need a mother;
the theater is my home.


2279
01:31:37.321 --> 01:31:39.333
The
best day of my life!


2280
01:31:39.333 --> 01:31:42.693
I realized
I don't like the arts.


2281
01:31:42.693 --> 01:31:46.173
It's extremely manic.

2282
01:31:46.173 --> 01:31:47.433
I love it here.

2283
01:31:47.433 --> 01:31:49.413
Everything is in its place.

2284
01:31:49.413 --> 01:31:51.873
There's order.

2285
01:31:51.873 --> 01:31:54.813
I'm content.

2286
01:31:54.813 --> 01:31:56.513
I'm finally content.

2287
01:31:56.513 --> 01:31:59.513
Finance, who knew?

2288
01:31:59.513 --> 01:32:02.273
And they say they may have a
full-time position opening up.


2289
01:32:02.273 --> 01:32:07.203
So we'll see.

2290
01:32:07.203 --> 01:32:10.785
But I'm very happy.

2291
01:33:08.055 --> 01:33:12.133
Trying
to give you up-- fiasco.


2292
01:33:12.133 --> 01:33:17.383
When I'm not with you,
I'm in airplane mode.


2293
01:33:17.383 --> 01:33:20.230
Trying to give you up--

2294
01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:22.098
fiasco.

2295
01:33:22.098 --> 01:33:27.663
When I'm not with you, I'm
stuck in airplane mode.


2296
01:33:27.663 --> 01:33:37.663
Airplane mode, airplane mode,
airplane mode, airplane mode.


2297
01:33:37.823 --> 01:33:40.213
Had to give you up.

2298
01:33:40.213 --> 01:33:42.868
Didn't choose to.

2299
01:33:42.868 --> 01:33:47.863
I don't feel like me
when I'm not with you.


2300
01:33:47.863 --> 01:33:52.803
You will always come,
but you never stay.


2301
01:33:52.803 --> 01:33:57.843
We will always fall and
go our separate ways.


2302
01:33:57.843 --> 01:34:02.179
How did I start walking
down this lonely road?


2303
01:34:02.179 --> 01:34:03.673
Lonely road.

2304
01:34:03.673 --> 01:34:08.433
That will always take
me as I grow more alone.


2305
01:34:08.433 --> 01:34:10.348
I miss our contact.

2306
01:34:10.348 --> 01:34:11.777
I miss holding hands.

2307
01:34:15.025 --> 01:34:19.063
This be aching.

2308
01:34:19.063 --> 01:34:24.343
Trying to give you up-- fiasco.

2309
01:34:24.343 --> 01:34:28.663
When I'm not with you,
I'm in airplane mode.


2310
01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:32.103
Trying to give you up--

2311
01:34:32.103 --> 01:34:34.261
fiasco.

2312
01:34:34.261 --> 01:34:39.001
When I'm not with you, I'm
stuck in airplane mode.


2313
01:34:39.001 --> 01:34:43.923
In a silk robe drinking
coffee all alone.


2314
01:34:43.923 --> 01:34:49.127
You know nothing good
ever happens in my phone.


2315
01:34:49.127 --> 01:34:54.002
You know nothing good
ever happens in my phone.


2316
01:34:54.002 --> 01:35:00.229
I took a wrong turn
at a fork in the road.


2317
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:05.292
Now I'm drinking
coffee in my silk robe.


2318
01:35:05.292 --> 01:35:10.715
Now I'm all alone drinking
coffee in my robe.


2319
01:35:10.715 --> 01:35:12.687
Oh!

2320
01:35:12.687 --> 01:35:18.110
Airplane mode.

2321
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:20.103
I'm all alone, baby.

2322
01:35:20.103 --> 01:35:22.433
Trying give you up--

2323
01:35:22.433 --> 01:35:23.816
fiasco.

2324
01:35:23.816 --> 01:35:24.738
Ah!

2325
01:35:24.738 --> 01:35:30.083
When I'm not with you,
I'm in airplane mode.


2326
01:35:30.083 --> 01:35:32.723
Trying to give you up--

2327
01:35:32.723 --> 01:35:34.103
fiasco.

2328
01:35:34.103 --> 01:35:35.483
Can't give you up, baby!

2329
01:35:35.483 --> 01:35:40.343
When I'm not with you, I'm
stuck in airplane mode.


2330
01:35:40.343 --> 01:35:45.625
Airplane mode,
airplane mode, baby.


2331
01:35:50.445 --> 01:35:53.093
Trying to give you up--

2332
01:35:53.093 --> 01:35:55.523
fiasco.

2333
01:35:55.523 --> 01:36:00.563
When I'm not with you,
I'm in airplane mode.


2334
01:36:00.563 --> 01:36:03.033
Trying to give you up--

2335
01:36:03.033 --> 01:36:05.698
fiasco.

2336
01:36:05.698 --> 01:36:11.003
When I'm not with you, I'm
stuck in airplane mode.


2337
01:36:11.003 --> 01:36:19.733
Airplane mode, airplane mode,
airplane mode, airplane mode.
