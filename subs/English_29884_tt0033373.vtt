1
00:02:11.178 --> 00:02:15.137
Make the same. It's good for you.
Spring air.


2
00:02:15.516 --> 00:02:18.952
The way you're gulping it up,
there won't be enough left to go around.


3
00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.988
Isn't it very hot for so early in April,
Dr. Gurkakoff?


4
00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:23.420
I'm not surprised.

5
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.482
This recent bombardment
by ions from the sun.


6
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.688
You see, temperature is due
to the quantity of molecular...


7
00:02:29.763 --> 00:02:31.492
Hey, hey. Stop, stop,

8
00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:33.123
if you don't want me to retaliate

9
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.226
by reciting all the tributary branches
of the Amazon.


10
00:02:36.303 --> 00:02:39.830
Incredible that only last week we were
drawing lots for our hot water bottle.


11
00:02:39.907 --> 00:02:43.104
Observe the forsythia or golden bell.

12
00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:45.441
I never knew it to bloom so early.

13
00:02:54.121 --> 00:02:56.089
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

14
00:02:57.558 --> 00:02:59.219
It's 8:46, gentlemen.

15
00:02:59.293 --> 00:03:01.921
Oh, Potts.
Just once more around the park.


16
00:03:01.995 --> 00:03:04.020
Before we go back to our mausoleum.

17
00:03:04.097 --> 00:03:05.826
I saw a scarlet tanager

18
00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:09.198
which must have flown
all the way from Florida just to enjoy it.


19
00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.930
- 1,500 miles.
- Yes.


20
00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:13.871
Our constitutional
has taken up too much time already.


21
00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:15.465
We're working under pressure.

22
00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:18.807
After nine years of effort we are,
as the race track enthusiast might say,


23
00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.437
in the home stretch.

24
00:03:20.514 --> 00:03:22.505
Three more years
and our encyclopedia will be finished.


25
00:03:22.583 --> 00:03:24.847
Let's not bog down
in the middle of the letter "S."


26
00:03:24.918 --> 00:03:27.045
All right. All right.
That's done it.


27
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.146
It's now 8:49, gentlemen.
I, for one, am going back to work.


28
00:03:30.224 --> 00:03:32.818
- Teacher's pet!
- Bertram Potts, the incorruptible.


29
00:03:32.893 --> 00:03:34.724
The eternal no-no man.

30
00:03:34.795 --> 00:03:35.784
Back home. Back home.

31
00:03:35.863 --> 00:03:38.388
Oh, well,
it may be raining this afternoon, anyway.


32
00:03:58.552 --> 00:04:00.645
- Good morning, Miss Bragg.
- Good morning, Miss Bragg.


33
00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:03.656
- Good morning, Miss Bragg.
- Good morning, Professor.


34
00:04:03.724 --> 00:04:05.589
- Good morning, Miss Bragg.
- Good morning.


35
00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.958
- Good morning, Miss Bragg.
- Good morning, Professor.


36
00:04:10.831 --> 00:04:14.130
Gentlemen, before you get down to work,
I have got something to say.


37
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:16.192
One of you made off with
a jar of strawberry preserves


38
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.532
from my pantry last night.

39
00:04:17.604 --> 00:04:22.041
<i>I located the empty jar on the shelf behind
The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.</i>


40
00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.340
That seems to indicate our historian,
Professor Peagram.


41
00:04:25.412 --> 00:04:26.845
I did no such thing, Miss Bragg.

42
00:04:26.914 --> 00:04:28.472
I'm not accusing anybody,

43
00:04:28.549 --> 00:04:32.041
but until it's cleared up, I think
we'll dispense with jam for breakfast.


44
00:04:32.119 --> 00:04:34.383
- Miss Bragg.
- Yes, Professor Oddly.


45
00:04:34.454 --> 00:04:36.046
I am the one.

46
00:04:36.123 --> 00:04:40.560
I was writing about strawberries
when suddenly I got a horrible craving.


47
00:04:40.627 --> 00:04:43.027
A crime confessed is half atoned.

48
00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:46.599
Miss Bragg. Miss Bragg.

49
00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:49.932
I had some material here.
What happened to it?


50
00:04:50.003 --> 00:04:51.095
What happened?

51
00:04:51.171 --> 00:04:53.639
I blushed for my duster
when I did your desk.


52
00:04:53.707 --> 00:04:56.733
You'll find everything
in the middle drawer, face down.


53
00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.110
I'm just starting my article on sex,
Miss Bragg. Any objections?


54
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:05.311
No, I trust you have more control
of yourself than Professor Oddly.


55
00:05:09.323 --> 00:05:11.917
Professor Gurkakoff,
your window shade again.


56
00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:13.926
Yes, Miss Bragg.

57
00:05:13.994 --> 00:05:16.656
It's a crime
to carelessly expose this good carpet.


58
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.221
You've just committed
a more serious crime, Miss Bragg.


59
00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:21.062
You have split an infinitive.

60
00:05:21.134 --> 00:05:24.900
Never "to carelessly expose."
Always "to expose carelessly."


61
00:05:24.972 --> 00:05:26.371
I'm not here to juggle words.

62
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.170
It's my job
to conscientiously see that this house...


63
00:05:29.242 --> 00:05:31.176
You've just split another one, Miss Bragg.

64
00:05:31.244 --> 00:05:32.302
- Professor...
- Oh, oh.


65
00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:34.006
- Here's whatchamacallit.
- Who?


66
00:05:34.081 --> 00:05:36.982
The lawyer for the Foundation.
And Miss Totten's with him.


67
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.245
And this place looking like a flicker's nest.

68
00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:43.221
Yes, we're in for our semi-annual wigging,
I suppose.


69
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.985
- You'd better put your coat on, Potts.
- Why? What...


70
00:05:45.058 --> 00:05:47.549
- Better fix your tie.
- Fix your hair, fix your hair.


71
00:05:47.628 --> 00:05:48.925
Say, what is all this nonsense?

72
00:05:48.996 --> 00:05:51.965
This nonsense is Miss Totten.
And will you please smile at her?


73
00:05:52.032 --> 00:05:53.260
Say, this is all very undignified.

74
00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:55.665
- lf you think you're being funny, I...
- Shh!


75
00:05:57.738 --> 00:06:00.036
- Morning, gentlemen.
Good morning.


76
00:06:00.107 --> 00:06:02.337
Won't you sit here, Miss Totten?

77
00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.400
It's a very nice morning, Miss Totten.

78
00:06:04.478 --> 00:06:06.378
Would you like to speak, Miss Totten,
or shall I?


79
00:06:06.446 --> 00:06:08.209
You, please, Mr. Larsen.

80
00:06:08.281 --> 00:06:10.340
I'll make this as brief as possible,
gentlemen.


81
00:06:10.417 --> 00:06:15.855
To date, $283,000 have been expended
in writing this encyclopedia.


82
00:06:16.223 --> 00:06:20.057
You all realize that Miss Totten's father,
the late Daniel S. Totten,


83
00:06:20.127 --> 00:06:22.721
left only a quarter of a million dollars
for this project.


84
00:06:22.796 --> 00:06:26.061
Every additional penny will have to come
from Miss Totten's own pocket.


85
00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:30.229
We would like a frank estimate
of how much longer you will take.


86
00:06:30.303 --> 00:06:35.297
- Maybe three years, maybe four.
- It cannot be. It just cannot be.


87
00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:37.309
Oh, my dear Miss Totten,

88
00:06:37.377 --> 00:06:39.902
you wouldn't discontinue
your father's great gesture


89
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.073
towards human enlightenment?

90
00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:44.674
"Human enlightenment."
What nonsense, Professor Jerome.


91
00:06:44.751 --> 00:06:48.118
Papa had just one reason for ever starting
this unfortunate enterprise.


92
00:06:48.188 --> 00:06:49.212
Vanity.

93
00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.655
He broke a blood vessel
because he found his name was omitted


94
00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:53.317
<i>from the Encyclopedia Britannica.</i>

95
00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:56.521
Because 30 pages were devoted
to Thomas Alva Edison,


96
00:06:56.596 --> 00:06:58.587
17 to Alexander Graham Bell,

97
00:06:58.665 --> 00:07:03.227
but not one line to Daniel S. Totten,
the inventor of the electric toaster.


98
00:07:04.671 --> 00:07:07.105
In our encyclopedia,

99
00:07:07.174 --> 00:07:10.371
Mr. Totten shall receive
an appropriate amount of space.


100
00:07:10.444 --> 00:07:12.002
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Yes, of course.


101
00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:15.276
- Three quarters of a page, I should think.
- Three quarters of a page?


102
00:07:15.348 --> 00:07:17.043
- That's all he deserves.
- Is it?


103
00:07:17.117 --> 00:07:18.778
You may go on, Mr. Larsen.

104
00:07:18.852 --> 00:07:21.377
All we ask is
that you bring this thing to a close


105
00:07:21.455 --> 00:07:24.117
somehow or the other.
Get on with it. Slap it together.


106
00:07:24.191 --> 00:07:26.489
Mr. Larsen, may I have a word?

107
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.791
- Hello, Professor Potts.
- Hello, Miss Totten.


108
00:07:30.864 --> 00:07:33.765
Mr. Larsen, you said, "Slap it together."

109
00:07:34.601 --> 00:07:36.398
We're not the slapping together kind.

110
00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:38.131
We have started an encyclopedia,

111
00:07:38.205 --> 00:07:40.901
and we shall finish it
as thoroughly as is humanly possible.


112
00:07:40.974 --> 00:07:43.841
- Another $100,000?
- lf necessary, yes.


113
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:47.073
If our work goes slowly
it's because the world, it goes so fast.


114
00:07:47.147 --> 00:07:49.411
Take Professor Jerome, our geographer.

115
00:07:49.483 --> 00:07:50.609
He has to rewrite all the time.

116
00:07:50.684 --> 00:07:52.379
- And Dr. Magenbruch...
I'm not interested.


117
00:07:52.452 --> 00:07:54.579
Don't interrupt, Mr. Larsen.

118
00:07:55.155 --> 00:07:56.782
Go on, Professor.

119
00:07:57.991 --> 00:08:00.016
I'm sure it's your wish that this monument

120
00:08:00.093 --> 00:08:03.392
to your father be finished
as nobly as it was begun.


121
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:09.198
I'm appealing to you, Miss Totten,

122
00:08:09.269 --> 00:08:11.169
to your vision and to your heart.

123
00:08:11.238 --> 00:08:13.229
Maybe I'm a little inarticulate,

124
00:08:13.306 --> 00:08:15.740
but I've always regarded you as a...

125
00:08:16.243 --> 00:08:17.767
Yes, Professor?

126
00:08:19.412 --> 00:08:21.403
Always regarded you as a...

127
00:08:22.883 --> 00:08:24.373
Oh, Professor.

128
00:08:27.053 --> 00:08:30.545
- You know what I mean, Miss Totten.
- Yes.


129
00:08:30.624 --> 00:08:33.149
I warn you, Miss Totten,
another four years of this, with...


130
00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:36.024
After all, it was Father's wish.

131
00:08:36.096 --> 00:08:39.725
But, gentlemen, you will hurry
and finish the encyclopedia, won't you?


132
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.825
- We will.
- Yes, yes, indeed.


133
00:08:43.904 --> 00:08:47.271
Last year, when all the other professors
came to my musical,


134
00:08:47.374 --> 00:08:49.706
where were you, 
Professor Potts?

135
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.838
Sinus. But I shall be there this year.

136
00:08:53.213 --> 00:08:56.205
I shall look forward to seeing you again.

137
00:08:56.283 --> 00:08:57.944
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


138
00:08:58.451 --> 00:09:00.510
- Goodbye, madam.
- Good day.


139
00:09:00.587 --> 00:09:02.350
- Good day.
- Good day.


140
00:09:05.892 --> 00:09:08.383
That maneuver down my spine
was very unnecessary.


141
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:10.326
- Was it, my dear Potts?
- Didn't it work?


142
00:09:10.997 --> 00:09:12.191
Hi.

143
00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:15.129
I hope you don't mind.
I came through the kitchen.


144
00:09:15.202 --> 00:09:17.636
Who are you?
- I'm the garbage man.


145
00:09:18.038 --> 00:09:20.506
I want to find out something
about Cleopatra.


146
00:09:20.574 --> 00:09:22.064
- Cleopatra?
- Yeah.


147
00:09:22.142 --> 00:09:24.303
This is some kind of a library or school,
isn't it?


148
00:09:24.377 --> 00:09:27.073
Neither, we are writing an encyclopedia.

149
00:09:27.147 --> 00:09:29.308
- Icyclo-what?
- An encyclopedia.


150
00:09:29.382 --> 00:09:32.044
A work which endeavors to compile
and catalog all human knowledge.


151
00:09:32.118 --> 00:09:33.813
Say, that's just what I need.

152
00:09:33.887 --> 00:09:35.946
Young man,
did you come through my kitchen?


153
00:09:36.022 --> 00:09:38.422
- That's right, sister.
- I'm not your sister, and you get out.


154
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:40.425
- Oh, now...
- Miss Bragg.


155
00:09:40.493 --> 00:09:42.154
Please, Miss Bragg,
we find this intensely interesting.


156
00:09:42.229 --> 00:09:43.218
Go on, please.

157
00:09:43.296 --> 00:09:45.196
You can't tell me
he's not infested with germs.


158
00:09:45.265 --> 00:09:48.428
Then go and get your gas mask.
Now, shoo, scat, skedaddle.


159
00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:51.436
- Please, won't you take a seat?
- Thanks, bo.


160
00:09:51.872 --> 00:09:53.464
I seen all these books
through the window,


161
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.474
and I figured
that maybe you can help me out.


162
00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:58.409
- In what way, young man?
- With this quizzola they got on the radio.


163
00:09:58.478 --> 00:09:59.502
- This what?
- Quizzola?


164
00:09:59.579 --> 00:10:01.206
Korn Krunchies Quiz
-Quiz.

165
00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:04.182
Send in 100 box covers,
and you stand to make a little dough.


166
00:10:04.251 --> 00:10:07.778
Well, with my opportunities,
I got about 3,000 box covers together.


167
00:10:07.854 --> 00:10:10.322
Only some of the answers
you have to send in to the questions.


168
00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:12.255
You know, like true or false.

169
00:10:12.893 --> 00:10:14.053
You have those questions here?

170
00:10:14.127 --> 00:10:15.116
Yeah, sure.

171
00:10:15.195 --> 00:10:17.425
Well, that's very interesting.

172
00:10:18.732 --> 00:10:21.223
"Question one. 
Cleopatra died...

173
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:23.360
"A. From swallowing a needle.

174
00:10:23.436 --> 00:10:25.370
"B. From snake bite.

175
00:10:25.438 --> 00:10:27.201
"C. From hiccups."

176
00:10:27.941 --> 00:10:30.466
That's my province. 
I cover history.

177
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:32.735
The correct answer is "B."

178
00:10:33.213 --> 00:10:37.309
Cleopatra, queen of Egypt,
daughter of Ptolemy Xlll, born 69 BC,


179
00:10:37.384 --> 00:10:40.410
killed herself
on the 29th day of August, 30 BC,


180
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.750
by placing an asp to her bosom.

181
00:10:42.822 --> 00:10:44.619
- A what?
- An asp.


182
00:10:45.225 --> 00:10:46.783
A small snake.

183
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.589
Well, patch my pantywaist.

184
00:10:48.662 --> 00:10:50.061
Well, well, next.

185
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:51.859
"Which way would you say it?

186
00:10:51.932 --> 00:10:53.399
"Two and two is five.

187
00:10:53.466 --> 00:10:55.161
"Two and two are five.

188
00:10:55.235 --> 00:10:56.862
"Two and two makes five."

189
00:10:56.937 --> 00:10:58.962
Professor Potts covers English.

190
00:10:59.039 --> 00:11:01.439
- Did you hear the question, Potts?
- I did.


191
00:11:01.508 --> 00:11:03.601
As the verb
is always governed by the subject,


192
00:11:03.677 --> 00:11:06.111
the correct answer is,
"Two and two are five."


193
00:11:06.179 --> 00:11:08.704
- Potts.
- Oh, no, Potts.


194
00:11:08.782 --> 00:11:12.616
Correct for a grammarian perhaps,
but not for a mathematician.


195
00:11:12.686 --> 00:11:14.278
Two and two are four.

196
00:11:15.689 --> 00:11:18.681
That's a good one.
Nobody's gonna get that.


197
00:11:18.758 --> 00:11:20.350
Well, I certainly am obliged.

198
00:11:20.427 --> 00:11:22.327
I could use a
bundle of scratch right now

199
00:11:22.395 --> 00:11:24.022
on account of I met
me a mouse last week.

200
00:11:24.097 --> 00:11:25.587
- Mouse?
- What a pair of gams.


201
00:11:25.665 --> 00:11:27.963
A little in, a little out,
and a little more out...


202
00:11:28.034 --> 00:11:29.399
I am still completely mystified.

203
00:11:29.469 --> 00:11:30.868
Well, with this dish on me hands

204
00:11:30.937 --> 00:11:33.804
and them giving away 25 smackaroos
on that quizzola.


205
00:11:33.873 --> 00:11:37.400
- Smackaroos?
- Smackaroos? What are smackaroos?


206
00:11:37.477 --> 00:11:39.741
- A smackaroo is a...
- No such word exists.


207
00:11:39.813 --> 00:11:42.805
Oh, it don't? A
smackaroo is a dollar, pal.

208
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:45.841
Well, the accepted vulgarism
for a dollar is a buck.


209
00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:49.252
The accepted vulgarism
for a smackaroo is a dollar.


210
00:11:49.322 --> 00:11:52.382
That goes for a banger, a fish,
a buck or a rug.


211
00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:53.756
Well, what about the mouse?

212
00:11:53.827 --> 00:11:56.318
The mouse is the dish.
That's what I need the moolah for.


213
00:11:56.396 --> 00:11:57.727
- Moolah?
- Yeah, the dough.


214
00:11:57.797 --> 00:12:00.061
We'll be stepping. Me and this smooch...
I mean, the dish,


215
00:12:00.133 --> 00:12:02.761
I mean, the mouse. You know,
hit the jiggles for a little rum boogie.


216
00:12:02.836 --> 00:12:03.894
Please, please, not so fast.

217
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.494
Brother, we're going to have
some hoytoytoy.


218
00:12:05.572 --> 00:12:06.630
- Hoytoytoy?
- Hoytoytoy?


219
00:12:06.706 --> 00:12:10.301
Yeah, and if you want that one explained,
you go ask your papas.


220
00:12:14.114 --> 00:12:16.912
That's Archie. 
His water's getting hot.

221
00:12:16.983 --> 00:12:18.575
Well, thanks again, gents.

222
00:12:18.651 --> 00:12:21.176
And if you ever want to get into
a contest sometime,


223
00:12:21.254 --> 00:12:22.949
just call on me.

224
00:12:23.023 --> 00:12:26.254
Maybe you've got the brains,
but I got the box covers.


225
00:12:26.726 --> 00:12:29.024
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, come again.


226
00:12:30.463 --> 00:12:33.455
Well, kind of a breezy fellow, isn't he?

227
00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:34.522
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


228
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:36.967
- He seems a most likeable gentleman.
- Yes.


229
00:12:37.037 --> 00:12:38.095
And I'm an idiot.

230
00:12:38.171 --> 00:12:39.832
- Idiot? Why?
- Why?


231
00:12:39.906 --> 00:12:41.533
Miss Bragg. Miss Bragg!

232
00:12:41.608 --> 00:12:43.075
- What's the matter, Potts?
- Well, what's...


233
00:12:43.143 --> 00:12:45.043
- I'm going out.
Going out?


234
00:12:45.111 --> 00:12:47.045
What's your prognosis
on the weather, Gurkakoff?


235
00:12:47.113 --> 00:12:49.581
- Light showers toward the evening, but...
- Yes, Professor Potts?


236
00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:51.310
Miss Bragg, my hat and my mackintosh.

237
00:12:51.384 --> 00:12:52.908
And put my luncheon sandwich
in the pocket.


238
00:12:52.986 --> 00:12:54.112
- But...
- Immediately.


239
00:12:54.187 --> 00:12:55.176
- Yes, sir.
- What's happened?


240
00:12:55.255 --> 00:12:56.916
What do you mean
you're going out, Potts?


241
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:58.753
- Where are you going?
- Research.


242
00:12:58.825 --> 00:13:00.383
Research? What research?

243
00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.826
- The garbage man. Didn't you hear him?
- Yes.


244
00:13:02.896 --> 00:13:05.421
Well, I didn't quite understand all he said.

245
00:13:05.498 --> 00:13:08.695
Nor did I. And it's catastrophic, gentlemen,
catastrophic.


246
00:13:08.768 --> 00:13:10.133
- Why?
- How so?


247
00:13:10.203 --> 00:13:12.433
I've just finished my article on slang.

248
00:13:12.505 --> 00:13:15.474
Twenty-three pages compiled
from a dozen reference books.


249
00:13:15.542 --> 00:13:17.271
- Eight hundred examples.
- Well?


250
00:13:17.343 --> 00:13:19.743
Everything
from the idiotic combination "absotively"


251
00:13:19.813 --> 00:13:21.474
to the pejorative use of "zigzag."

252
00:13:21.548 --> 00:13:23.072
I traced the evolution of "hunky dory,"

253
00:13:23.149 --> 00:13:25.640
tracked down "skiddo" from "skedaddle."

254
00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:28.783
Eight hundred examples and I may as well
throw it in the waste basket.


255
00:13:28.855 --> 00:13:31.346
- Three weeks' work.
- Potts, you're hysterical.


256
00:13:31.424 --> 00:13:34.086
Outmoded.
Based on reference books 20 years old.


257
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.027
Take "smooch." Take "dish." Take...

258
00:13:37.097 --> 00:13:40.498
- Hoytoytoy?
- Hoytoytoy. Not one of them included.


259
00:13:40.567 --> 00:13:43.661
Living in this house cut off from the world,
I've lost touch.


260
00:13:43.736 --> 00:13:45.101
And it's inexcusable.

261
00:13:45.171 --> 00:13:48.538
That man talked a living language.
I embalmed some dead phrases.


262
00:13:48.608 --> 00:13:51.543
- But where are you going?
- Out to collect new data,


263
00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:54.603
to tap the sources of slang,
the major sources.


264
00:13:54.681 --> 00:13:56.376
The streets. The slums.

265
00:13:56.449 --> 00:13:59.316
- The theatrical and allied professions.
- Oh, now, Potts, don't you think that...


266
00:13:59.385 --> 00:14:01.353
I know it's regrettable,
this loss of time, gentlemen,


267
00:14:01.421 --> 00:14:03.184
but it must be done.

268
00:14:05.325 --> 00:14:07.657
Leave the key under the mat.
I won't be home before 9:00.


269
00:14:07.727 --> 00:14:08.989
Yes, sir.

270
00:14:10.463 --> 00:14:13.091
I'm writing about the planet Saturn.

271
00:14:13.166 --> 00:14:15.999
Do I insist on
going to the planet Saturn?

272
00:14:16.936 --> 00:14:20.997
Maybe my data on sex
is a little outdated, too.


273
00:14:23.009 --> 00:14:26.308
Just a moment, please.
Do you mind if I ride along with you?


274
00:14:26.379 --> 00:14:27.903
Hop on, buddy.

275
00:14:29.282 --> 00:14:32.342
Extra! Extra!
Nab Benny the Creep in cement killing!


276
00:14:32.418 --> 00:14:35.615
Read all about it.
Corpse's dogs dunked into cement.


277
00:14:35.688 --> 00:14:36.712
Extra! Extra!

278
00:14:38.091 --> 00:14:39.991
Ice-pick killing!
Link Benny the Creep with Big Tom!


279
00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:41.424
Extra! Extra!

280
00:14:41.494 --> 00:14:43.724
Seek man behind the man
behind the murder ring!


281
00:14:43.796 --> 00:14:45.661
Extra! Extra!

282
00:14:47.467 --> 00:14:49.401
Hey, what are you,
checking up on me or something?


283
00:14:49.469 --> 00:14:52.461
Four words, blitz it, mister.
Blitz it, will you? You give me the mimis.


284
00:14:52.539 --> 00:14:54.769
- "Mimis"?
- Yeah, the screaming mimis.


285
00:14:54.841 --> 00:14:55.899
Extremely picturesque.

286
00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:57.772
Young man,
could I interest you in a research project


287
00:14:57.844 --> 00:14:59.175
in which you could be very helpful?

288
00:14:59.245 --> 00:15:01.907
And what you promoting?
Some kind of reform school?


289
00:15:01.981 --> 00:15:04.211
If you would come to this address
at 9:30 tomorrow morning,


290
00:15:04.284 --> 00:15:06.411
you'd be doing society a definite service.

291
00:15:06.486 --> 00:15:08.716
Who are you anyway? 
Father Flanagan?

292
00:17:37.537 --> 00:17:39.971
Come on, Krup, knock yourself out.

293
00:19:02.388 --> 00:19:05.551
Three, four, five,

294
00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:09.789
six, seven, eight,

295
00:19:09.862 --> 00:19:13.389
nine, ten, eleven,

296
00:19:13.466 --> 00:19:17.061
twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

297
00:19:25.678 --> 00:19:26.872
Yeah!

298
00:19:34.854 --> 00:19:37.584
Young man,
what is the name of that song?


299
00:19:37.657 --> 00:19:39.625
<i>- Boogie.
- What does "boogie" mean?</i>


300
00:19:39.692 --> 00:19:41.284
Are you kidding?

301
00:19:50.069 --> 00:19:52.333
More! More!
Yeah!


302
00:19:52.405 --> 00:19:55.272
- Okay, what do you want, hep cats?
- More of the same.


303
00:19:55.341 --> 00:19:56.638
- Same thing?
- Yeah.


304
00:19:56.709 --> 00:19:59.177
Okay, we'll mix it up a little.
Come on down, Krup.


305
00:19:59.245 --> 00:20:00.906
You're gonna have to be
awful quiet on this.


306
00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:02.447
I'm gonna need a little help,
okay, squares?


307
00:20:02.515 --> 00:20:03.777
- All right.
- All right.


308
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.114
I want this chair,
and we'll clean off the table.


309
00:20:06.185 --> 00:20:07.743
A little juice down here, junior.

310
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:09.981
- What's cooking, Sugar?
- Match boogie, Krup. How about it?


311
00:20:10.056 --> 00:20:11.489
Want match boogie? You'll get it.
Where's some matches?


312
00:20:11.557 --> 00:20:12.649
I have some right here.

313
00:20:17.597 --> 00:20:18.621
You two go with me,

314
00:20:18.698 --> 00:20:21.326
and the rest of you take boogie
with you on the orchestra, right?


315
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.458
- Right.
- Okay.


316
00:20:22.535 --> 00:20:25.129
Here we go, Krup, like buster's gang.

317
00:20:25.204 --> 00:20:27.195
Very quiet. One, two.

318
00:20:44.323 --> 00:20:45.517
Boogie.

319
00:21:16.556 --> 00:21:17.853
Yeah!

320
00:21:20.927 --> 00:21:22.918
Young man,
what is the name of that young lady?


321
00:21:22.995 --> 00:21:25.327
- Sugarpuss O'Shea.
- An astounding specimen.


322
00:21:25.398 --> 00:21:29.334
She jives by night, root, zoot and cute
and solid to boot.


323
00:21:29.402 --> 00:21:31.233
- Are you kidding?
- No.


324
00:21:32.939 --> 00:21:34.531
- Come on, Sugar, quick.
- Yeah, quick is right.


325
00:21:34.607 --> 00:21:35.631
What's the fever?

326
00:21:35.708 --> 00:21:37.039
Listen, Sugie, you gotta
take it on the lam.

327
00:21:37.109 --> 00:21:38.098
- Yeah, they're looking for you.
- Who?


328
00:21:38.177 --> 00:21:39.303
- The District Attorney's office.
- Why?


329
00:21:39.378 --> 00:21:40.572
You've got to get
dressed and out of here

330
00:21:40.646 --> 00:21:42.079
- before they slap a subpoena on you.
- A subpoena?


331
00:21:42.148 --> 00:21:43.843
Shh! Come on, we'll talk about it
in the dressing room.


332
00:21:43.916 --> 00:21:45.679
Well, why can't you tell me now?

333
00:21:47.954 --> 00:21:49.581
What is all this subpoena business?

334
00:21:49.655 --> 00:21:51.350
On account of
Benny the Creep had an accident.


335
00:21:51.424 --> 00:21:52.982
I never heard of Benny the Creep.
Who's he?


336
00:21:53.059 --> 00:21:54.617
- One of the boys.
- He was on kind of an errand


337
00:21:54.694 --> 00:21:56.389
when he grazed into a police car,
that dope.


338
00:21:56.462 --> 00:21:59.454
And for that I've got to hide out?
That don't make sense, Pastrami.


339
00:21:59.532 --> 00:22:01.466
No, you see,
when the bulls gave Benny a ticket,


340
00:22:01.534 --> 00:22:03.001
they saw Kinnick in
the back of the car.

341
00:22:03.069 --> 00:22:04.229
- Dead.
- In the accident?


342
00:22:04.303 --> 00:22:05.827
That's what Benny was trying to tell them.

343
00:22:05.905 --> 00:22:08.066
- Only they saw Kinnick's feet.
- They was in a cake of cement.


344
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.698
Benny was gonna dump him
in the East River.


345
00:22:09.775 --> 00:22:12.471
- That was the errand.
- What is all this? Where do I come...


346
00:22:12.545 --> 00:22:14.513
Wait a second.
Is Joe Lilac mixed up in this?


347
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.207
The DA had him picked up
about a half hour ago.


348
00:22:16.282 --> 00:22:18.580
That's why we're here.
That's why you got to beat it.


349
00:22:18.651 --> 00:22:20.482
- Joe Lilac mixed up in a murder?
- Yeah.


350
00:22:20.553 --> 00:22:21.986
I don't believe it, not for a second.

351
00:22:22.054 --> 00:22:24.352
He was framed, Sugie, honest he was,
may I drop down dead.


352
00:22:24.423 --> 00:22:26.823
- Wasn't he, Asthma?
- And there was them pajamas they found.


353
00:22:26.892 --> 00:22:28.587
- Pajamas?
- Yeah, that's where you come in.


354
00:22:28.661 --> 00:22:31.221
Remember the dozen pink ones
you gave to the boss last Christmas?


355
00:22:31.297 --> 00:22:33.492
Before you knew
that the only color Joe Lilac wears is lilac?


356
00:22:33.566 --> 00:22:35.158
- Yeah.
- So we handed them out to the boys.


357
00:22:35.234 --> 00:22:38.260
And in the suitcase right beside
Benny the Creep when he gets caught


358
00:22:38.337 --> 00:22:40.430
is a pair with that big JL monogram.

359
00:22:43.809 --> 00:22:45.037
Who is it?

360
00:22:45.111 --> 00:22:48.137
I'd like to speak to Miss O'Shea
regarding an investigation I'm conducting.


361
00:22:48.347 --> 00:22:50.474
Okay, we'll take care of it.

362
00:22:50.816 --> 00:22:52.340
Just a minute.

363
00:22:57.023 --> 00:22:58.888
- How do you do, Miss O'Shea?
- Hello.


364
00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:00.858
I hate to intrude like this,
but mine is a very...


365
00:23:00.926 --> 00:23:02.120
Cut the corners. What is it?

366
00:23:02.194 --> 00:23:05.095
Well, this inquiry
is one of considerable importance.


367
00:23:05.164 --> 00:23:07.132
- Stop beating up with the gums.
- What was that?


368
00:23:07.199 --> 00:23:08.689
Get this. I don't know from nothing.

369
00:23:08.768 --> 00:23:11.464
Oh, but you do.
Every word you say proves as much.


370
00:23:11.537 --> 00:23:13.937
- Where's that paper?
- Subpoena?


371
00:23:14.006 --> 00:23:17.271
Suppose you tell the DA
to take a nice running jump for himself?


372
00:23:17.343 --> 00:23:20.471
Bewildering. And you want to tell me
you're not the person I'm looking for?


373
00:23:20.546 --> 00:23:24.209
- Say, how many of you are on this job?
- The entire project? Eight.


374
00:23:24.283 --> 00:23:27.411
Oh. The other seven waiting outside?

375
00:23:27.486 --> 00:23:29.477
Oh, no. They're at home.
Sound asleep I imagine.


376
00:23:29.555 --> 00:23:32.251
- Asleep?
- Yes, they go to bed at 9:00 every night.


377
00:23:32.324 --> 00:23:35.418
Do you mean to tell me
with crime what it is in New York...


378
00:23:35.494 --> 00:23:37.223
Say, are you a bull or aren't you?

379
00:23:37.296 --> 00:23:40.288
Well, if bull is the slang word
for professor, then I'm a bull.


380
00:23:40.366 --> 00:23:41.924
- A professor?
- Of English.


381
00:23:42.001 --> 00:23:42.990
Oh.

382
00:23:43.069 --> 00:23:45.230
I thought
there was some misunderstanding.


383
00:23:45.304 --> 00:23:46.430
Sure was.

384
00:23:46.505 --> 00:23:48.837
You see, I'm conducting an investigation
on current slang.


385
00:23:48.908 --> 00:23:51.706
Would you object
if I used you for observation and study?


386
00:23:51.777 --> 00:23:53.472
- Yeah, I would.
- lf I could have your assistance


387
00:23:53.546 --> 00:23:54.638
for just a few days it would be...

388
00:23:54.714 --> 00:23:56.272
Out, out, Professor.

389
00:23:56.348 --> 00:23:58.748
- Then you won't help me?
- No. Out. Shove in your clutch.


390
00:23:58.818 --> 00:24:01.150
"Shove in your clutch."
Exactly the kind of thing I want.


391
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.688
Perhaps if I could come back here again
when you have more time...


392
00:24:03.756 --> 00:24:06.020
Save the gas. I
won't be here after tonight.

393
00:24:06.092 --> 00:24:08.617
Well, look,
here's the address of the Foundation


394
00:24:08.694 --> 00:24:10.787
if you should happen
to change your mind by any chance.


395
00:24:10.863 --> 00:24:12.990
- It's my residence, as well.
- Listen, not now.


396
00:24:13.065 --> 00:24:16.626
- Well, I'll just leave it here.
- Okay, scrow, scram, scraw.


397
00:24:16.702 --> 00:24:19.796
The complete conjugation.
All right, I'll scraw.


398
00:24:21.807 --> 00:24:23.866
Stop futzing around.
You haven't got time to get dressed.


399
00:24:23.943 --> 00:24:25.467
- All right. Only I...
We'll go out the window.


400
00:24:25.544 --> 00:24:27.205
I think you're a pair of cracked dice.

401
00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:32.213
- Excuse me.
- Look out, mister.


402
00:24:37.556 --> 00:24:38.921
Good night.

403
00:24:40.092 --> 00:24:42.390
- Miss O'Shea.
- What do you want?


404
00:24:43.629 --> 00:24:45.062
Right there.

405
00:24:51.871 --> 00:24:54.396
Open up. District Attorney's office.

406
00:25:06.752 --> 00:25:09.277
- Where to?
- Just keep cruising, Jack.


407
00:25:10.356 --> 00:25:13.553
- Well?
- How about that warehouse on West 11th?


408
00:25:13.626 --> 00:25:15.059
- No. Too many rats.
- Hey, wait a minute.


409
00:25:15.127 --> 00:25:17.357
- Where are you taking me?
- It's just for the night, Sugarpuss.


410
00:25:17.429 --> 00:25:19.420
We can't take you to your place,
they'll have it covered.


411
00:25:19.498 --> 00:25:21.762
Joe's apartment,
they got sealed up like a can of coffee.


412
00:25:21.834 --> 00:25:24.394
Oh, I see.
Yeah, but you live someplace, don't you?


413
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:25.869
Yeah, sure and the cops know where.

414
00:25:25.938 --> 00:25:29.339
Yeah, hotel, I thought of a hotel,
but they'll fan every hotel in town.


415
00:25:29.408 --> 00:25:30.705
Well, I could change my name.

416
00:25:30.776 --> 00:25:34.268
Listen, Sugie, why take chances?
It's an awful nice warehouse.


417
00:25:34.346 --> 00:25:37.679
He says rats, big mouth does.
Well, maybe a few little bitty mice.


418
00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.739
Uh-uh. That's out.

419
00:25:38.818 --> 00:25:41.878
Tomorrow we'll get hold of a lawyer
and figure out something with more class.


420
00:25:41.954 --> 00:25:43.785
Say, I got an uncle who's an undertaker

421
00:25:43.856 --> 00:25:46.086
and with business like it is,
he's always got an extra slab.


422
00:25:46.158 --> 00:25:49.150
That's fine. That's all I need.
Keep thinking.


423
00:25:50.262 --> 00:25:51.991
Hey, what's this?

424
00:25:52.064 --> 00:25:54.658
"Bertram Potts..."
Oh, that's that professor jerk.


425
00:25:59.271 --> 00:26:00.260
Uh-oh.

426
00:26:05.678 --> 00:26:07.669
I never would have believed it.

427
00:26:07.746 --> 00:26:09.543
But how do you account for the name?

428
00:26:09.615 --> 00:26:11.105
Have I missed anything?

429
00:26:11.183 --> 00:26:13.048
No, I was just about to explain...

430
00:26:13.118 --> 00:26:15.552
- You see, the word "puss" means face.
- Yes.


431
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:18.215
As for instance, sourpuss, picklepuss.

432
00:26:18.991 --> 00:26:21.653
Sugarpuss implies
a certain sweetness in her appearance.


433
00:26:21.727 --> 00:26:22.716
- Sugar, yes, yes.
- Yes.


434
00:26:22.795 --> 00:26:24.353
Never mind the etymology.

435
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.022
- Was she...
- Was she blonde or brunette?


436
00:26:26.098 --> 00:26:28.896
- Yes, which?
- That, I don't know. I didn't notice.


437
00:26:29.335 --> 00:26:31.360
But her vocabulary,
even in ordinary conversation...


438
00:26:31.437 --> 00:26:33.268
You spoke to her?

439
00:26:33.339 --> 00:26:35.136
- Yes, in her dressing room...
- In her dressing room?


440
00:26:35.207 --> 00:26:37.038
- Backstage?
- Yes.


441
00:26:37.109 --> 00:26:40.772
Unfortunately,
she disclaimed any interest in our project


442
00:26:42.414 --> 00:26:45.281
in words so bizarre
they made my mouth water.


443
00:26:45.351 --> 00:26:48.218
- "Shove in your clutch," for instance.
- Why, it's amazing.


444
00:26:48.287 --> 00:26:50.312
Potts, could you tell us
what was it like backstage?


445
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:52.152
Very vivacious, I imagine.

446
00:26:52.224 --> 00:26:56.718
And perhaps, ballerinas giggling
up and down iron staircases.


447
00:26:56.795 --> 00:26:58.353
Around and around.

448
00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:01.058
- Possibly wearing tights.
- Tights.


449
00:27:01.133 --> 00:27:04.227
And that ineffable smell of rice powder.

450
00:27:04.303 --> 00:27:05.964
On nude shoulders.

451
00:27:07.706 --> 00:27:08.832
Well.

452
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:11.774
It's getting a bit late, gentlemen.

453
00:27:11.844 --> 00:27:14.039
Perhaps we had better get to bed.

454
00:27:22.621 --> 00:27:24.589
Someday, I'll tell you my experiences

455
00:27:24.657 --> 00:27:26.522
with a young actress
named Lillian Russell.


456
00:27:26.592 --> 00:27:27.616
Did you know her?

457
00:27:27.693 --> 00:27:29.627
I stood in the snow
four hours to get to...

458
00:27:30.796 --> 00:27:32.696
Is that our doorbell?

459
00:27:32.765 --> 00:27:34.232
But it's 12:25.

460
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:37.599
It must be the statistics
on San Salvador's saltpeter.


461
00:27:37.937 --> 00:27:38.926
I'll get it.

462
00:27:39.004 --> 00:27:42.064
I asked for it
to be sent registered airmail.

463
00:27:45.444 --> 00:27:46.706
Hi-de-ho.

464
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.178
Don't tell me I'm too late for class,
Professor.


465
00:27:50.249 --> 00:27:51.238
Oh, my goodness gracious.

466
00:27:52.551 --> 00:27:54.143
Say, what is that?

467
00:27:55.387 --> 00:27:57.582
- Those are my colleagues.
- Oh.


468
00:27:58.357 --> 00:28:01.793
- I apologize for their lack of costume.
- Oh, that's all right, Professor.


469
00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.623
And the fact
that I haven't got my tie on and...


470
00:28:03.696 --> 00:28:06.927
Oh, you know,
once I watched my big brother shave.


471
00:28:08.734 --> 00:28:10.861
- Won't you come in?
- Why not?


472
00:28:11.904 --> 00:28:14.964
Frankly, your coming here
was the last thing I expected.


473
00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.302
Your "no" was so explicit.

474
00:28:16.375 --> 00:28:17.865
Well, I got thinking it over

475
00:28:17.943 --> 00:28:20.537
and "Foo," I said to myself,
"Who am I to give science the brush?"


476
00:28:20.612 --> 00:28:24.139
- Then I take it you've reconsidered?
- Yeah, that's the big idea.


477
00:28:24.216 --> 00:28:25.342
Well.

478
00:28:26.151 --> 00:28:27.880
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

479
00:28:28.787 --> 00:28:30.049
Look out.

480
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:34.919
- Well, that was Professor Oddly.
- Any more of them around?


481
00:28:34.994 --> 00:28:36.393
I hope not.

482
00:28:37.129 --> 00:28:39.324
Say, who decorated this place?

483
00:28:40.733 --> 00:28:42.360
- The mug that shot Lincoln?
- This is our work room.


484
00:28:42.968 --> 00:28:45.129
The living quarters are upstairs.

485
00:28:45.204 --> 00:28:48.230
That's a lot of books. 
All of them different?

486
00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:49.329
- I trust.
- Uh-huh.


487
00:28:49.441 --> 00:28:51.966
- May I have your coat?
- Yeah, thanks.


488
00:28:53.479 --> 00:28:54.878
Miss O'Shea.

489
00:28:56.882 --> 00:29:01.012
Greek philosophy,
I've got a set like this with a radio inside.


490
00:29:01.453 --> 00:29:03.546
Are you sure you don't want your coat?

491
00:29:03.622 --> 00:29:06.648
No, I'm fine.
Except I've got a run in this stocking.


492
00:29:06.725 --> 00:29:08.249
Well, how do we start, Professor?

493
00:29:08.327 --> 00:29:11.455
You see, this is the first time
anybody moved in on my brain.


494
00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:13.794
Have you got some kind of a machine,

495
00:29:13.866 --> 00:29:16.994
an X-ray or a vacuum cleaner maybe
that sorts out the words you want?


496
00:29:17.069 --> 00:29:18.627
What's your method, Professor?

497
00:29:18.704 --> 00:29:22.003
Well, it's quite simple. If you will be here
tomorrow morning not later than 9:30...


498
00:29:22.074 --> 00:29:23.063
Tomorrow morning?

499
00:29:23.142 --> 00:29:25.872
Why, yes.
I have arranged a round table discussion


500
00:29:25.944 --> 00:29:28.742
with a few people of various backgrounds.

501
00:29:28.814 --> 00:29:29.940
Uh-huh.

502
00:29:30.015 --> 00:29:33.815
You don't think we could sort of
begin the Beguine right now?


503
00:29:33.886 --> 00:29:35.979
Well, it's nearly 1:00, Miss O'Shea.

504
00:29:36.055 --> 00:29:38.148
Oh, foo, Professor,
let's get ourselves a couple of drinks,


505
00:29:38.223 --> 00:29:40.953
light the fire maybe, and you can start
working on me right away.


506
00:29:41.026 --> 00:29:44.291
I wouldn't think of imposing upon you
at this hour.


507
00:29:44.363 --> 00:29:47.230
Listen, I figured on working all night.

508
00:29:47.299 --> 00:29:50.894
Well, any hasty random discussion
would be of no scientific value.


509
00:29:50.969 --> 00:29:52.903
You see, I have to have my notes
thoroughly prepared


510
00:29:52.971 --> 00:29:54.996
- for the seminar tomorrow.
- Mmm-hmm.


511
00:29:55.641 --> 00:29:57.575
Okay. Where do I sleep?

512
00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:00.039
I don't know. Where do you live?

513
00:30:00.112 --> 00:30:01.841
Up on Riverside.
But I'm going to sleep here.


514
00:30:01.914 --> 00:30:03.108
Here?

515
00:30:03.182 --> 00:30:05.116
You don't understand, Miss O'Shea.

516
00:30:05.184 --> 00:30:09.086
We're all bachelors with the exception
of Professor Oddly, who is a widower.


517
00:30:09.154 --> 00:30:10.917
Why, no woman ever...

518
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.583
Even Miss Bragg who takes care
of our needs


519
00:30:13.659 --> 00:30:15.991
goes home every night at 7:30.

520
00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:18.552
If you want me
tomorrow morning at 9:30, you...


521
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.530
Oh, I do, Miss O'Shea.

522
00:30:22.835 --> 00:30:26.327
Even the most free-thinking people
must respect the...


523
00:30:27.473 --> 00:30:29.270
All right, feel that.

524
00:30:29.808 --> 00:30:31.673
Go on. Feel that foot.

525
00:30:33.212 --> 00:30:35.703
Okay, tootsie bell, what do you say?

526
00:30:35.781 --> 00:30:38.272
- It's cold.
- It's cold and it's wet.


527
00:30:39.918 --> 00:30:41.476
Now, come here.

528
00:30:43.589 --> 00:30:44.920
Come here.

529
00:30:47.526 --> 00:30:48.754
Closer.

530
00:30:50.395 --> 00:30:51.589
Closer.

531
00:30:52.397 --> 00:30:54.365
Come on, give.

532
00:30:54.433 --> 00:30:57.027
Hello, kids. Look down my throat.

533
00:30:57.102 --> 00:30:58.694
Go on. Look down.

534
00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.670
All right, right down there, look.

535
00:31:00.739 --> 00:31:02.900
I don't know what to look for.

536
00:31:02.975 --> 00:31:07.002
There is possibly a slight rosiness
in the laryngeal region.


537
00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:08.569
Slight rosiness?

538
00:31:08.647 --> 00:31:11.047
<i>It's as red as the Daily Worker
and just as sore.</i>


539
00:31:11.116 --> 00:31:12.640
- Who are you?
- I'm...


540
00:31:12.718 --> 00:31:13.878
Who is he?

541
00:31:13.952 --> 00:31:17.388
This is Dr. Magenbruch,
our physiological expert.


542
00:31:17.456 --> 00:31:19.287
This is Professor Robinson, law.

543
00:31:19.358 --> 00:31:23.192
- Professor Gurkakoff...
- Not so fast. Just let it creep up on me.


544
00:31:23.262 --> 00:31:24.661
I'll get to know them.

545
00:31:24.730 --> 00:31:27.961
Come here, physiology.
For all I know, I've got a fever. Feel.


546
00:31:28.033 --> 00:31:29.295
- It's possible.
- Certainly.


547
00:31:29.368 --> 00:31:31.768
And he wants to throw
me out on my tin.

548
00:31:31.837 --> 00:31:34.601
There'll be no 9:30 for me
if you let me go out in the rain now.


549
00:31:34.673 --> 00:31:35.697
Naturally not.

550
00:31:35.774 --> 00:31:38.174
With the streets cold
and the subway hot and full of germs.


551
00:31:38.243 --> 00:31:40.677
I'm a push-over for streptococcus.

552
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.774
- Can I have this now, kid?
- Pardon me.


553
00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:47.949
We'll call you a heated taxi and furnish you
with woolen socks and warm slippers.


554
00:31:48.020 --> 00:31:50.454
- How do you like that?
- Really, I don't understand you, Potts.


555
00:31:50.522 --> 00:31:52.854
- Why take chances?
- With valuable material?


556
00:31:52.925 --> 00:31:55.826
- You must think of your article, Potts.
- See, they get the point.


557
00:31:55.894 --> 00:31:58.021
If I might venture a suggestion,

558
00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.859
why couldn't the young lady
sleep in my room?


559
00:31:59.932 --> 00:32:01.126
- What?
- What?


560
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.327
- Well!
- Professor Peagram!


561
00:32:04.102 --> 00:32:06.036
I can bunk in with Professor Robinson.

562
00:32:06.104 --> 00:32:07.935
I sometimes do
when there's an electric storm.


563
00:32:08.006 --> 00:32:09.803
Yes, he's afraid of thunder.

564
00:32:09.875 --> 00:32:12.207
Well, then it's all settled.

565
00:32:12.277 --> 00:32:15.542
Well, I guess I'll turn in.
Can I have my coat?


566
00:32:15.614 --> 00:32:18.208
- Of course.
- Thank you.


567
00:32:18.283 --> 00:32:20.342
- Hi-de-ho, fellows.
- Hi-de-ho.


568
00:32:21.186 --> 00:32:23.984
- I'll show you to my room.
- Yes, we all will go.


569
00:32:24.056 --> 00:32:25.421
I know where my
own room is, thank you,

570
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.583
- without any help from you.
- Why shouldn't... Why shouldn't...


571
00:32:27.659 --> 00:32:30.321
I'll find it. Don't bother.
Just rough out the directions.


572
00:32:30.395 --> 00:32:33.023
Top of the stairs
and the third door on the left.


573
00:32:33.098 --> 00:32:34.963
Gentlemen, just a moment, please.

574
00:32:35.033 --> 00:32:36.557
Gentlemen, this is all highly irregular.

575
00:32:36.635 --> 00:32:38.762
What if this should come
to the attention of the Foundation?


576
00:32:38.837 --> 00:32:40.202
And what about Miss Bragg tomorrow?

577
00:32:40.272 --> 00:32:42.832
What are you talking about?
This is research, isn't it?


578
00:32:42.908 --> 00:32:44.170
- Yes.
- Certainly.


579
00:32:44.243 --> 00:32:46.973
Who was that guy learned so much
from watching an apple drop?


580
00:32:47.045 --> 00:32:51.106
Isaac Newton, 1642 to 1727.

581
00:32:51.183 --> 00:32:53.845
- The law of gravity.
- Yeah, that's him.


582
00:32:54.419 --> 00:32:58.515
And I want you to look at me
as another apple, Professor Potts.


583
00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.319
Just another apple.

584
00:33:09.167 --> 00:33:11.032
It fits you like a glove,
you admit that, don't you?


585
00:33:11.103 --> 00:33:14.402
I like a little more effect around
the shoulders, sort of a puffed sleeve.


586
00:33:14.473 --> 00:33:18.034
- You know that JL could be Joe Lilac.
- Could be.


587
00:33:18.577 --> 00:33:21.671
- Still claim it isn't yours?
- No, it isn't and never was.


588
00:33:21.747 --> 00:33:24.773
Come on, loosen up, Joe.
It's 5:00 in the morning.


589
00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:27.182
How's about a little Benzedrine?

590
00:33:27.252 --> 00:33:29.345
- Put it on Benny the Creep.
- Sure.


591
00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:30.752
Take off your coat.

592
00:33:30.822 --> 00:33:34.223
I should have brought along my valet.
I'm a sucker for comfort.


593
00:33:34.293 --> 00:33:36.955
Why, don't worry, Joe.
You'll have your comfort.


594
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:41.432
We'll have platinum bars on your cell,
and we'll heat up a chair for you, special.


595
00:33:41.533 --> 00:33:43.057
Twenty thousand volts.

596
00:33:44.536 --> 00:33:45.798
AC or DC?

597
00:33:49.541 --> 00:33:52.066
- So those are your pajamas, huh?
- Yep.


598
00:33:52.911 --> 00:33:55.471
You always wear them
three sizes too big?


599
00:33:55.547 --> 00:33:59.813
Allows for my chest expansion.
And my fingers get kind of chilly at night.


600
00:33:59.885 --> 00:34:01.819
And the JL?

601
00:34:03.055 --> 00:34:06.149
It stands for jellybean.
It stands for lollipop.


602
00:34:07.459 --> 00:34:09.290
- Take him away.
- Come on.


603
00:34:09.361 --> 00:34:11.488
That's fine. That's great.

604
00:34:12.764 --> 00:34:15.927
You never heard of Benny the Creep.
Benny the Creep never heard of you.


605
00:34:16.001 --> 00:34:18.265
There was no murder.
And there is no murder ring


606
00:34:18.337 --> 00:34:21.568
with you at the control boards
pushing the buttons.


607
00:34:22.107 --> 00:34:23.836
- Good morning, Joe.
- Hiya, McNeary?


608
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:26.070
Morning, and pardon my glove,
Mr. District Attorney.


609
00:34:26.144 --> 00:34:27.771
Good morning.

610
00:34:27.846 --> 00:34:32.283
- All right, I've got a writ of habeas corpus.
- I've forgotten my reading glasses.


611
00:34:32.351 --> 00:34:34.512
Too bad. Come on, Joe.

612
00:34:34.586 --> 00:34:36.577
May be a couple of days
before I find them.


613
00:34:36.655 --> 00:34:39.783
- I won't stand for my client's...
- It's all right, McNeary.


614
00:34:39.858 --> 00:34:41.826
The man's trying to clean up the city.

615
00:34:41.893 --> 00:34:44.088
Why not give him
all the cooperation we can?


616
00:34:44.162 --> 00:34:47.620
- Does that mean you're going to talk, Joe?
- What about?


617
00:34:48.467 --> 00:34:50.992
Well, I'll make the pajamas talk.

618
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:53.060
Here's the sales slip for them.

619
00:34:53.138 --> 00:34:56.198
They were bought by Miss O'Shea.
She bought them for you.


620
00:34:56.274 --> 00:34:59.368
Or maybe you never heard of her.
Maybe she isn't your girlfriend.


621
00:34:59.444 --> 00:35:03.642
- Why bring a lady's name into this?
- I'll bring the lady in herself.


622
00:35:05.784 --> 00:35:08.651
Where do we stand with that O'Shea girl?
What?


623
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:10.119
What about the deputies?

624
00:35:10.188 --> 00:35:11.815
All right, let me talk to Collins himself.

625
00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:13.414
- What about the girl?
- Don't worry.


626
00:35:13.492 --> 00:35:15.858
We've got her in safe deposit temporarily.

627
00:35:15.927 --> 00:35:19.090
- Temporarily is not good enough.
- I've got something figured out.


628
00:35:19.164 --> 00:35:21.257
- Nothing gloomy, I hope.
- Strictly legal.


629
00:35:21.333 --> 00:35:22.857
A wife can't testify against her husband.

630
00:35:22.934 --> 00:35:24.629
- She's not my wife.
- Not yet, she isn't.


631
00:35:24.703 --> 00:35:26.933
But once they let you go,
we'll pull a fastie.


632
00:35:27.005 --> 00:35:28.336
Of all the incompetent...

633
00:35:28.407 --> 00:35:30.136
What sweetheart dreamed up that law?

634
00:35:30.208 --> 00:35:34.269
Don't give me that. You've had six hours.
Tell those guys to get a jump on.


635
00:35:37.048 --> 00:35:38.640
Having some trouble, Mr. DA?

636
00:35:38.717 --> 00:35:40.048
Don't worry, Joe.

637
00:35:40.118 --> 00:35:43.087
And don't underestimate this office
or the State of New York.


638
00:35:43.155 --> 00:35:46.215
I've got some boys
that can find a needle in a haystack.


639
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:47.485
Why, that's a cinch.

640
00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:51.859
All you have to do is get a horse
to eat the hay and then X-ray the horse.


641
00:35:59.237 --> 00:36:01.000
Okay. Okay.

642
00:36:02.541 --> 00:36:04.168
Hold your horses.

643
00:36:07.045 --> 00:36:09.309
- Good morning.
- Good morning.


644
00:36:09.414 --> 00:36:12.247
What time is it?
This is worse than being in the army.


645
00:36:12.317 --> 00:36:15.286
Professor Potts started
the round table discussion 10 minutes ago.


646
00:36:15.353 --> 00:36:17.719
He did? Say, that's divastigating.

647
00:36:17.789 --> 00:36:20.485
- And this came for you.
- Who brought it?


648
00:36:20.992 --> 00:36:23.460
- A couple of persons.
- Any message?


649
00:36:23.528 --> 00:36:26.588
- Well, they spoke very picturesquely.
- Yeah, very.


650
00:36:26.665 --> 00:36:29.759
Yes, they said it's getting hot and hotter

651
00:36:29.835 --> 00:36:32.633
and to stay in the icebox
like a good little salad.


652
00:36:32.704 --> 00:36:34.968
And this is the dressing.

653
00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.565
- The salad, huh?
- And we wondered what it meant.


654
00:36:37.642 --> 00:36:38.666
Yes, we did.

655
00:36:38.743 --> 00:36:40.540
I'll tell you, sweetie. I...

656
00:36:40.612 --> 00:36:41.977
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.

657
00:36:42.047 --> 00:36:43.674
- Miss Bragg.
- Oh, my goodness.


658
00:36:43.748 --> 00:36:46.046
Sounds like Mother calling.
Kids, you better go.


659
00:36:46.117 --> 00:36:48.051
See you later.

660
00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:52.112
- Gentlemen, where are you, gentlemen?
- We're coming, Miss Bragg, we're coming.


661
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:54.658
- On our way.
- I would like to talk to you.


662
00:36:54.726 --> 00:36:55.715
I wanted to ask you,

663
00:36:55.794 --> 00:36:57.762
what were all your trousers
doing in my kitchen?


664
00:36:57.829 --> 00:37:00.127
- I wanted mine pressed.
- Well, that accounts for one pair.


665
00:37:00.198 --> 00:37:01.995
- I did, too.
- Mine, too.


666
00:37:02.067 --> 00:37:03.932
Seven pairs, all at once?

667
00:37:04.002 --> 00:37:06.061
What's going on in this house anyway?

668
00:37:06.137 --> 00:37:09.129
No constitutional this morning.
You've hardly touched your breakfast.


669
00:37:09.207 --> 00:37:12.540
Professor Potts in the dining room with
a conglomeration of dubious characters.


670
00:37:12.611 --> 00:37:13.737
You, not at your desks.

671
00:37:13.812 --> 00:37:17.339
- That's right, gentlemen, we have to work.
- Yes, we have to work.


672
00:37:17.415 --> 00:37:22.318
- What were you doing upstairs, anyway?
- We took up a suitcase.


673
00:37:22.387 --> 00:37:24.116
- Suitcase?
- Yes.


674
00:37:24.189 --> 00:37:26.453
- Whose suitcase?
- We're very busy, Miss Bragg.


675
00:37:26.525 --> 00:37:27.719
I said, whose suitcase?

676
00:37:27.792 --> 00:37:31.125
Well, now, Miss Bragg, there is...

677
00:37:32.864 --> 00:37:35.298
- There is someone staying with us.
- Staying with us?


678
00:37:35.367 --> 00:37:38.200
- That's it.
- Who?


679
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.669
Who's staying with us?

680
00:37:39.738 --> 00:37:41.933
What's the matter? 
Cat got your tongues?

681
00:37:42.007 --> 00:37:44.134
- Who's staying with us?
- Well, I...


682
00:37:44.209 --> 00:37:47.645
- Well, I... Oh, dear.
- Professor Potts didn't tell you?


683
00:37:47.712 --> 00:37:50.044
- No, and I want to know.
- Well, under the pressure


684
00:37:50.115 --> 00:37:52.310
- of a very trying assignment...
- Yes?


685
00:37:52.384 --> 00:37:54.648
- He's...
- Go on.


686
00:37:54.719 --> 00:37:57.347
- He's taken a temporary assistant.
- Yes.


687
00:37:57.422 --> 00:38:00.323
- So we're running a hotel now.
- Not exactly.


688
00:38:00.392 --> 00:38:03.520
It seems to me that... 
Professor Robinson,

689
00:38:03.595 --> 00:38:06.928
- is that one of your socks?
- No, not mine.


690
00:38:07.732 --> 00:38:09.359
I wish that it...

691
00:38:11.002 --> 00:38:14.301
Well, I know Professor Peagram
explains the corset he wears


692
00:38:14.372 --> 00:38:15.771
as due to a floating kidney.

693
00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.239
What's the explanation of this?

694
00:38:17.309 --> 00:38:21.609
Say, kids, I'm stuck.
Any of you can jerk a zipper?


695
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.908
A zipper?

696
00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:25.347
Yeah, the darn thing's stuck...

697
00:38:25.417 --> 00:38:27.146
Hello, who are you?

698
00:38:27.218 --> 00:38:30.745
- This is our Miss Bragg.
- Miss... Did you say Bag?


699
00:38:30.822 --> 00:38:32.380
Bragg. How do you do?

700
00:38:32.457 --> 00:38:34.391
Great-o.
Do you know anything about zippers?


701
00:38:34.459 --> 00:38:35.858
- Do you? Do you?
- Well, I...


702
00:38:35.927 --> 00:38:37.224
- Well, do you?
- Do I?


703
00:38:37.295 --> 00:38:40.696
- No, I don't, but Professor Gurkakoff.
- Okay.


704
00:38:40.765 --> 00:38:43.791
- Well, it's purely mechanical.
- But look, you were married.


705
00:38:43.868 --> 00:38:45.062
No, I'm just a botanist.

706
00:38:45.136 --> 00:38:47.468
Look, kids, after all,
you know, this is only a zipper.


707
00:38:47.539 --> 00:38:49.769
- Come on, Gurky.
- Well, I can try.


708
00:38:49.841 --> 00:38:52.105
You know, I had this happen one night
in the middle of my act.


709
00:38:52.177 --> 00:38:55.010
I couldn't get a thing off,
was I embarrassed.


710
00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.479
How's chances for a cup of coffee?

711
00:38:56.548 --> 00:38:59.540
- No breakfast after 9:00.
- You see, it's a rule.


712
00:38:59.618 --> 00:39:02.712
Just like my Aunt Beulah that
brought me up, that's why I left home.


713
00:39:02.787 --> 00:39:03.776
- There.
- Oh, swell.


714
00:39:03.855 --> 00:39:05.618
Now where is this little clambake
of Professor Potts'?


715
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:09.091
- In the dining room, just across the hall.
- In the dining room. See you later, kids.


716
00:39:13.965 --> 00:39:17.128
Don't tell me the jive session
has beat off without baby.


717
00:39:17.202 --> 00:39:19.670
Shut the door please, Miss O'Shea.

718
00:39:23.174 --> 00:39:24.198
You're late.

719
00:39:24.275 --> 00:39:26.470
I won't waste time with introductions.
These are our collaborators.


720
00:39:26.544 --> 00:39:28.068
- Hi, kids.
- Hi.


721
00:39:28.146 --> 00:39:30.671
As I was saying, I've worked out
a series of cross-references


722
00:39:30.749 --> 00:39:32.842
which I believe will be the best approach
to our subject.


723
00:39:32.917 --> 00:39:34.350
Going like gangbusters, isn't he?

724
00:39:34.419 --> 00:39:36.080
Sit down, please.

725
00:39:39.424 --> 00:39:42.621
I don't think
you'll find our venture dull, Miss O'Shea.


726
00:39:42.694 --> 00:39:46.528
The scientific conquest of
an important subject is never dull.


727
00:39:47.298 --> 00:39:49.960
"Slang," as the poet
Carl Sandburg has said,


728
00:39:50.035 --> 00:39:51.696
"is language which takes off its coat,

729
00:39:51.770 --> 00:39:53.931
"spits on its hands and goes to work."

730
00:39:54.005 --> 00:39:56.906
Let us... Let us, too,
then get down to work.


731
00:40:03.581 --> 00:40:06.482
Well, we've accomplished a lot
in the last three days,


732
00:40:06.551 --> 00:40:09.076
and I'm very grateful to all of you.

733
00:40:09.154 --> 00:40:11.645
There's another word
I'd like to take up now.


734
00:40:11.723 --> 00:40:13.782
It's recurred several times
in our discussions,


735
00:40:13.858 --> 00:40:15.849
and its meaning still eludes me.

736
00:40:15.927 --> 00:40:17.519
I think it was Miss O'Shea
who used it yesterday


737
00:40:17.595 --> 00:40:20.223
in reference to the cuffs that I wear.

738
00:40:20.298 --> 00:40:23.028
- The word is "corny."
- Yeah, wouldn't you say they were corny?


739
00:40:23.101 --> 00:40:26.468
- Because of the cornstarch in them?
- Because it's 1941.


740
00:40:27.205 --> 00:40:31.164
- Then corny means old-fashioned.
- Kind of hick, loose-tooth.


741
00:40:31.242 --> 00:40:32.766
Mortimer Snerd.

742
00:40:33.578 --> 00:40:35.136
Oh, gee.

743
00:40:35.747 --> 00:40:37.408
There's other kinds of corn, too.

744
00:40:37.482 --> 00:40:39.143
When you give your girl
your fraternity pin,


745
00:40:39.217 --> 00:40:41.515
well, if she says, "I'll keep it forever,"

746
00:40:41.586 --> 00:40:43.850
- that's corny, too.
- Yeah, or take a joke.


747
00:40:43.922 --> 00:40:45.719
"That's no lady, that's my wife."

748
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:48.122
Making your baby's shoes into ashtrays.

749
00:40:48.193 --> 00:40:49.558
- That's corn.
- Right off the cob.


750
00:40:49.627 --> 00:40:51.925
Well, let's stick to corn.

751
00:40:51.996 --> 00:40:53.861
Is it synonymous with baloney?

752
00:40:53.932 --> 00:40:57.026
No, it's anything
that gets them in the sticks.


753
00:40:57.102 --> 00:40:59.696
"Long time, no see," that's Indian corn.

754
00:40:59.771 --> 00:41:01.329
Yeah, when a guy comes to see a girl
and says,


755
00:41:01.406 --> 00:41:03.237
"Let's turn off the lights,
it hurts my eyes."


756
00:41:03.308 --> 00:41:05.003
Brother, that's corn.

757
00:41:05.076 --> 00:41:08.136
The implication is
he's trying to pull some hoytoytoy.


758
00:41:08.213 --> 00:41:12.172
- You're catching on, Professor.
- Countrified, old-fashioned, sentimental.


759
00:41:25.196 --> 00:41:26.686
Business kind of peaked, Jack?

760
00:41:26.765 --> 00:41:29.666
Yeah, it takes up a lot of time
being on the faculty.


761
00:41:29.734 --> 00:41:31.702
- I'll buy the heap.
- There's no call for you to do that.


762
00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:33.601
Why not?
I want to line my bureau drawers.


763
00:41:33.671 --> 00:41:34.797
Gee, thanks.

764
00:41:35.573 --> 00:41:38.804
- Back in a second, Professor.
- Oh, yes, all right.


765
00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:54.952
- Miss O'Shea.
- Just a minute.


766
00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:00.356
- Miss O'Shea.
- Yeah?


767
00:42:00.431 --> 00:42:02.296
We saw you pass the library arch,

768
00:42:02.367 --> 00:42:04.665
and we kind of got a little problem
on our hands.


769
00:42:04.736 --> 00:42:06.169
- Would you help us?
- Why, I'd love to.


770
00:42:06.237 --> 00:42:07.261
Oh, good.

771
00:42:08.072 --> 00:42:10.040
You're kind of spruced up today,
aren't you, Professor?


772
00:42:10.108 --> 00:42:11.735
- The spats?
- Yeah.


773
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:15.439
I ran across them in my bottom drawer.
Why let the moths eat them?


774
00:42:15.513 --> 00:42:17.572
Attaboy. What's your problem, sweetie?

775
00:42:17.649 --> 00:42:19.514
- Well, look.
- Let me start again.


776
00:42:19.717 --> 00:42:21.742
But, Professor,
I'm completely exhausted.


777
00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:25.017
But we've got to get it right.
Now, start with the right foot.


778
00:42:25.089 --> 00:42:26.750
- The left foot.
- The right foot.


779
00:42:26.825 --> 00:42:27.883
Gentlemen, it's the left foot.

780
00:42:27.959 --> 00:42:30.018
- Which foot, please?
- The right foot.


781
00:42:30.094 --> 00:42:32.187
All right, but you're wrong.

782
00:42:32.697 --> 00:42:34.892
One, two, three, four.

783
00:42:34.966 --> 00:42:37.366
One, two, three.

784
00:42:37.435 --> 00:42:39.903
But I can't "humph" from here.

785
00:42:41.105 --> 00:42:44.268
We've been working on it
ever since luncheon.


786
00:42:44.342 --> 00:42:45.468
Holy smoke.

787
00:42:45.543 --> 00:42:49.138
- Start again with the left foot, come on.
- The left foot.


788
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:53.783
One, two, three.

789
00:42:54.919 --> 00:42:56.614
Well, it's the right motion.

790
00:42:56.688 --> 00:43:00.055
- But it doesn't feel right.
- It doesn't look right.


791
00:43:00.592 --> 00:43:02.389
Possibly it isn't right.

792
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:04.792
There was two "humphs." Humph, humph.

793
00:43:04.863 --> 00:43:07.297
Well, that would make it right.
Humph, humph.


794
00:43:08.132 --> 00:43:09.394
You're wrong, my dear Gurkakoff.

795
00:43:09.467 --> 00:43:12.095
Mathematics can never be wrong.
Look here, I'll show you.


796
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.400
- Stay there, Professor Oddly.
- Show him.


797
00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.573
One, two.

798
00:43:17.642 --> 00:43:19.439
Professor Oddly, please stand up.

799
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:20.738
I beg your pardon.

800
00:43:20.812 --> 00:43:24.373
- One, two, three. Humph, humph.
- Just one.


801
00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.214
- The expert is here. We need you.
- What's the trouble?


802
00:43:28.286 --> 00:43:30.117
Well, that dance you showed us last night.

803
00:43:30.188 --> 00:43:31.917
- Yeah?
- Yes, maybe we're not very bright.


804
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:35.790
Professor Gurkakoff has been trying
to reconstruct it by compound fractions.


805
00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.192
- You'd better relax, lover.
- Who, me? Thank you.


806
00:43:38.263 --> 00:43:42.222
I can't find the common denominator
between the steps and the music.


807
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.996
You bet you can't, you're playing
a polka, and I taught you a conga.


808
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:47.697
How about some light in here? Come on.

809
00:43:48.506 --> 00:43:50.406
Look, kids, this is the tempo.

810
00:43:54.045 --> 00:43:55.273
Got it?

811
00:43:59.317 --> 00:44:01.649
- That's right, hit it.
- Hit what?


812
00:44:01.719 --> 00:44:03.346
That's what I told you.

813
00:44:03.755 --> 00:44:07.714
- One, two, three...
- Attaboy, Gurky! You're wonderful!


814
00:44:09.527 --> 00:44:12.223
Wing it, Professor. Hang on.

815
00:44:13.464 --> 00:44:14.931
Good afternoon.

816
00:44:17.201 --> 00:44:18.463
How do you like the new suit?

817
00:44:18.536 --> 00:44:20.663
What the well-dressed professor will wear.

818
00:44:20.738 --> 00:44:23.172
A young lady chased me all the way up
Fifth Avenue.


819
00:44:23.241 --> 00:44:25.209
Probably to tell you
to take the price tag off.


820
00:44:25.276 --> 00:44:27.244
Did you... Did you get the records?

821
00:44:27.312 --> 00:44:29.746
<i>Well, they were all out of
Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar.</i>


822
00:44:29.814 --> 00:44:31.714
<i>- Oh, dear, oh, dear.
- But I got Chicka Chicka Boom Boom</i>


823
00:44:31.783 --> 00:44:35.480
<i>- and Shoot the Sherbet to Me Herbert.
- Now watch us go.</i>


824
00:44:37.989 --> 00:44:39.183
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

825
00:44:39.257 --> 00:44:41.316
The same time tomorrow,
all of you who can.


826
00:44:41.392 --> 00:44:43.360
- Okay, coach, so long.
- Goodbye.


827
00:44:43.428 --> 00:44:46.329
This has given me
a new interest in life, Doc.


828
00:44:46.397 --> 00:44:47.421
Me, too.

829
00:44:47.498 --> 00:44:49.864
I'm gonna use some of those
two-dollar words hollering my papers.


830
00:44:49.934 --> 00:44:53.893
Park Avenue bigamy scandal,
most illuminating, most illuminating!


831
00:44:53.972 --> 00:44:56.236
- So long, Prof.
- And thank you very much.


832
00:44:56.307 --> 00:44:57.604
That's all right.

833
00:44:57.675 --> 00:44:59.472
Excuse me for talking shop,

834
00:44:59.544 --> 00:45:02.411
but your garbage certainly
has cheered up these days.


835
00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:07.179
Flowers, candy boxes, perfume wrappings
and an empty of that sweet French liqueur.


836
00:45:07.251 --> 00:45:10.152
Why, that's not our garbage,
I'm sure.


837
00:45:10.221 --> 00:45:12.280
Maybe it wasn't, but
it was in your pail.

838
00:45:15.393 --> 00:45:17.224
I'm leaving, sister.

839
00:45:20.565 --> 00:45:21.964
Miss Bragg.

840
00:45:22.033 --> 00:45:23.432
May I have a word with you,
Professor Potts?


841
00:45:23.501 --> 00:45:24.900
That music, is it coming from next door?

842
00:45:24.969 --> 00:45:27.403
From this door, and that's what
I want to talk to you about.


843
00:45:27.472 --> 00:45:29.099
Either she goes or I go.

844
00:45:29.173 --> 00:45:32.370
- You're speaking of Miss O'Shea?
- I am, Professor Potts.


845
00:45:32.443 --> 00:45:36.743
That is the kind of woman
that makes whole civilizations topple.


846
00:45:36.814 --> 00:45:40.944
It's always been my pride to scrupulously,
untiringly, efficiently...


847
00:45:41.019 --> 00:45:43.385
Now, now, Miss Bragg,
you've split that infinitive three times.


848
00:45:43.454 --> 00:45:45.752
I repeat, either she goes or I go.

849
00:45:45.823 --> 00:45:48.656
I don't like ultimata, Miss Bragg,
but I shall look into the matter.


850
00:45:48.726 --> 00:45:51.923
Don't look into the matter,
look into the library.


851
00:46:08.212 --> 00:46:10.544
Hiya, Pottsy, come on, hook on!

852
00:46:10.615 --> 00:46:12.242
I feel so abandoned.

853
00:46:21.526 --> 00:46:23.187
Hey, what's the big idea?

854
00:46:23.261 --> 00:46:26.628
As soon as you gentlemen get your breath,
we had better have a conference.


855
00:46:26.697 --> 00:46:28.187
Will you please leave the room,
Miss O'Shea?


856
00:46:28.266 --> 00:46:32.225
- But we've only just started.
- lf you please, Miss O'Shea.


857
00:46:32.303 --> 00:46:34.237
Loose-tooth again.

858
00:46:34.305 --> 00:46:36.170
Now, if you gentlemen will be kind enough

859
00:46:37.842 --> 00:46:39.707
to get together all that you've written
in the last three days...


860
00:46:47.919 --> 00:46:49.045
Well, it's about time.

861
00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:51.020
I thought you two had amnesia
and forgot where you parked me.


862
00:46:51.089 --> 00:46:52.113
Hold the phone, Sugie.

863
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.488
Dropping me on the doorstep
like a throwaway for a credit dentist.


864
00:46:54.559 --> 00:46:56.584
- You said it was for one night.
- Sugie, for snap's sake.


865
00:46:56.661 --> 00:46:58.891
You're as hot as a pistol.
The DA's got 100 men on the job.


866
00:46:58.963 --> 00:47:01.591
Why, they're squeezing this town
through a sieve, borough by borough.


867
00:47:01.666 --> 00:47:02.894
You tell her, Pastrami.

868
00:47:02.967 --> 00:47:05.629
They're tailing us, Sugie. Took us
three hours to get here from 48th Street.


869
00:47:05.703 --> 00:47:07.500
Detoured through Jamaica, Long Island
to shake them off.


870
00:47:07.572 --> 00:47:08.630
Okay, you wait here.

871
00:47:08.706 --> 00:47:10.105
I'll get my things together
in two seconds flat.


872
00:47:10.174 --> 00:47:11.573
Hey, wait a minute, Sugie.

873
00:47:11.642 --> 00:47:15.305
- We got a surprise for you.
- You ain't leaving, not right yet.


874
00:47:15.379 --> 00:47:16.641
I'm not? Joe's out, isn't he?

875
00:47:16.714 --> 00:47:19.683
Yeah, but for how long? They're laying
for you so they can get him back.


876
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:20.774
That's the surprise.

877
00:47:20.852 --> 00:47:23.582
I'm supposed to stay in this old mans'
home till the moths eat holes in me?


878
00:47:23.654 --> 00:47:26.145
Say, when I say a surprise,
I mean a surprise.


879
00:47:26.224 --> 00:47:27.919
Go on, flash it to her.

880
00:47:27.992 --> 00:47:30.358
Put on your sunglasses, Sugie.

881
00:47:30.995 --> 00:47:33.862
- Oh, boy.
- Seven grand boiled into that one, Sugie.


882
00:47:34.665 --> 00:47:37.031
Joe doesn't have to bribe me
just because I do him a little favor.


883
00:47:37.101 --> 00:47:38.659
It's not a bribe,
don't take it like that.

884
00:47:38.736 --> 00:47:39.896
Let him try and get it back though.

885
00:47:39.971 --> 00:47:41.131
Say, it's not your size, is it?

886
00:47:41.205 --> 00:47:43.070
lt'll do, if I have
to whittle down my finger.

887
00:47:43.141 --> 00:47:45.371
Third finger, left hand, Sugie.

888
00:47:45.443 --> 00:47:47.536
- Who do you think you're kidding?
- The future Mrs. Joe Lilac.


889
00:47:47.612 --> 00:47:49.409
- Come again?
- Wedding bells, sweetheart.


890
00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:51.072
Joe and the lawyer have got it
all figured out.


891
00:47:51.149 --> 00:47:52.946
Yeah, a wife can't testify
against husband, see.


892
00:47:53.017 --> 00:47:54.348
Don't put it like that, you dope.

893
00:47:54.418 --> 00:47:58.616
Say, he's been thataway about you
ever since he first picked you out.


894
00:47:58.689 --> 00:48:01.123
Yeah, but it took the DA
to make him pop the question.


895
00:48:01.192 --> 00:48:02.318
He sent you a love message.

896
00:48:02.393 --> 00:48:05.419
He says to tell you he gets more bang
out of you than any dame he ever knew.


897
00:48:05.496 --> 00:48:08.693
And he's the top, Sugie,
do you realize that? He's the top.


898
00:48:08.799 --> 00:48:10.266
Mrs. Joe Lilac.

899
00:48:10.334 --> 00:48:12.996
Third Avenue girl
in the major league at last.


900
00:48:13.070 --> 00:48:15.368
Wait till they find out,
those other dolls in the show.


901
00:48:15.439 --> 00:48:17.532
Watch me break their crockery with this.

902
00:48:17.608 --> 00:48:19.200
Here, here,
the wedding's got to be a fast one, though.


903
00:48:19.277 --> 00:48:20.539
Over in New Jersey someplace.

904
00:48:20.611 --> 00:48:23.045
Now, this is the application for the license,
and you sign right here.


905
00:48:23.114 --> 00:48:24.775
- Will I? You got a pen?
- Yeah.


906
00:48:24.849 --> 00:48:27.079
- Unscrew it for Mrs. Lilac.
- Right here, right here.


907
00:48:27.151 --> 00:48:28.243
You know, I can't make up my mind.

908
00:48:28.319 --> 00:48:32.653
Will I continue my night club career
or bust in on the Helen Hayes racket?


909
00:48:32.723 --> 00:48:34.486
Say, this ought to be signed
before a notary public.


910
00:48:34.559 --> 00:48:37.255
I'm a notary public,
permission expires 1943.


911
00:48:37.328 --> 00:48:39.057
Were those pajamas a good investment.

912
00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:41.155
You'll get the final dope
by tomorrow morning.


913
00:48:41.232 --> 00:48:42.324
Joe will phone around 10:00.

914
00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.834
Now, meantime lie low
and stick close to the Ameche.


915
00:48:44.902 --> 00:48:47.200
- Okay, the what?
- The telephone.


916
00:48:51.676 --> 00:48:54.509
- Miss Sugarpuss.
- You'd better duck.


917
00:48:54.579 --> 00:48:56.672
- Okay, 10:00, I'll be waiting.
- Okay, okay.


918
00:48:56.747 --> 00:48:58.715
- Miss Sugarpuss.
- Here I am.


919
00:48:58.783 --> 00:49:00.683
Just getting a little air.

920
00:49:00.751 --> 00:49:03.311
- Miss O'Shea.
- What's buzzing, cousin?


921
00:49:03.387 --> 00:49:05.787
Professor Potts would...

922
00:49:05.856 --> 00:49:08.723
He wishes to speak to you.

923
00:49:09.093 --> 00:49:10.355
- Yes.
- Yes.


924
00:49:10.428 --> 00:49:12.658
Don't worry, kids, cheer up.

925
00:49:14.198 --> 00:49:16.428
- Shut the door, please.
- Sure.


926
00:49:20.504 --> 00:49:23.962
- Take this chair, please, Miss O'Shea.
- This particular one?


927
00:49:24.041 --> 00:49:25.167
Okay.

928
00:49:28.312 --> 00:49:30.280
- Open your mouth, please.
- Hmm?


929
00:49:30.348 --> 00:49:32.816
Open your mouth. Wider.

930
00:49:33.951 --> 00:49:34.975
Thank you.

931
00:49:35.052 --> 00:49:36.610
- Can I close it now?
- Please do.


932
00:49:36.687 --> 00:49:37.984
- Okay.
- Miss O'Shea.


933
00:49:38.055 --> 00:49:39.079
Yeah?

934
00:49:39.156 --> 00:49:42.523
Circumstances, under, over which
neither of us has the least control,


935
00:49:42.593 --> 00:49:45.653
force me to a step
I am most reluctant to take.


936
00:49:46.964 --> 00:49:49.956
The sky is perfectly clear.
The thermometer stands at 76.


937
00:49:50.034 --> 00:49:53.128
Your throat seems quite normal.
I must ask you to leave.


938
00:49:53.204 --> 00:49:55.263
Leave here? Why?

939
00:49:55.339 --> 00:49:58.172
Miss O'Shea,
I want you to look at our project,


940
00:49:58.242 --> 00:50:01.405
I mean the encyclopedia, as a voyage,

941
00:50:01.479 --> 00:50:03.947
a long, hard, tedious one.

942
00:50:04.015 --> 00:50:06.074
A voyage from "A" to "Z."

943
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:08.015
Now, when the Foundation
launched our vessel,


944
00:50:08.085 --> 00:50:12.545
it very wisely followed an old rule
of the sea, no women aboard.


945
00:50:12.623 --> 00:50:15.490
It chose a crew of single men
with nothing to distract them


946
00:50:15.559 --> 00:50:17.151
from the course they were to sail.

947
00:50:17.228 --> 00:50:20.425
Say, junior, couldn't stop
walking around a little, could you?


948
00:50:20.498 --> 00:50:23.626
For four days, we have been drifting,
Miss O'Shea.


949
00:50:23.701 --> 00:50:26.033
The needle of the compass
no longer points to the magnetic pole.


950
00:50:26.103 --> 00:50:28.731
It points, if I may
say so, to your ankles.

951
00:50:28.806 --> 00:50:31.104
Come now, Admiral,
a bunch of grown men,


952
00:50:31.175 --> 00:50:33.166
they've seen a pair of ankles before.

953
00:50:33.244 --> 00:50:34.734
Not for nine years.

954
00:50:34.812 --> 00:50:38.805
Except for the singularly uninspiring
underpinnings of Miss Bragg.


955
00:50:38.883 --> 00:50:40.282
Now, my colleagues...

956
00:50:40.351 --> 00:50:42.581
If you think I'm bothering them,
I'll sit on my legs.


957
00:50:42.653 --> 00:50:45.053
- And I'll do it in my room or in the kitchen.
- Too late.


958
00:50:45.122 --> 00:50:48.353
- You must leave, Miss O'Shea.
- Well, I can't leave now.


959
00:50:48.426 --> 00:50:50.917
How about that slang?
It's not finished yet.


960
00:50:50.995 --> 00:50:52.895
There's a lot of words
we haven't caught up with.


961
00:50:52.963 --> 00:50:55.796
For instance, do you know what this
means, "I'll get you on the Ameche"?


962
00:50:55.866 --> 00:50:57.094
- No.
- Of course, you don't.


963
00:50:57.168 --> 00:50:58.533
An Ameche is the telephone.

964
00:50:58.602 --> 00:51:00.433
- On account of he invented it.
- Oh, no, he didn't.


965
00:51:00.504 --> 00:51:05.134
- You know, in the movies.
- I see what you mean. Very interesting.


966
00:51:05.276 --> 00:51:08.939
Make no mistake, I shall regret
the absence of your keen mind.


967
00:51:09.013 --> 00:51:13.074
Unfortunately, it is inseparable
from an extremely disturbing body.


968
00:51:14.452 --> 00:51:16.750
All right. I'll go, only don't shove.

969
00:51:16.821 --> 00:51:19.517
- I'll leave sometime tomorrow.
- Not tomorrow. Right away.


970
00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:21.717
- But I tell you I've got a...
- I insist, Miss O'Shea.


971
00:51:21.792 --> 00:51:23.225
Oh, Crabapple Annie.

972
00:51:23.294 --> 00:51:24.955
- Listen, Pottsy...
- Crabapple Annie?


973
00:51:25.029 --> 00:51:27.190
Why, that implies
that I'm puritanical and narrow-minded.


974
00:51:27.264 --> 00:51:28.288
Yeah.

975
00:51:28.366 --> 00:51:31.062
I am a perfectly normal man
with perfectly normal instincts.


976
00:51:31.135 --> 00:51:33.603
- But an awful high boiling point.
- Not even that.


977
00:51:33.671 --> 00:51:36.469
I, too, have been acutely aware
of your presence.


978
00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:38.337
- You have?
- Twice, to be exact.


979
00:51:38.409 --> 00:51:39.740
Once when you leaned over my shoulder

980
00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:41.744
to correct my spelling of
the word "boogie-woogie,"


981
00:51:41.812 --> 00:51:43.541
I could feel your breath on my ear.

982
00:51:43.614 --> 00:51:46.048
And yesterday afternoon when you
happened to stand against the window


983
00:51:46.117 --> 00:51:48.415
with the sunlight in your hair.

984
00:51:50.154 --> 00:51:53.317
- What'd you do about it?
- I left the room,


985
00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:54.983
dipped my handkerchief in cold water

986
00:51:55.059 --> 00:51:56.959
and applied it to the back of
my neck right there,


987
00:51:57.027 --> 00:52:00.087
- where the nerve center is.
- That's cute.


988
00:52:00.164 --> 00:52:03.224
You see, that's the basic difference
between me and the other professors.


989
00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.030
We are all beguiled,
but I am relatively young.


990
00:52:06.103 --> 00:52:07.400
I can suppress temptation.

991
00:52:07.471 --> 00:52:11.032
I generate enough energy
to take precautionary measures.


992
00:52:12.243 --> 00:52:15.701
A little sun on my hair
and you had to water your neck.


993
00:52:17.782 --> 00:52:20.216
Perhaps I shouldn't have mentioned it,
Miss O'Shea,


994
00:52:20.284 --> 00:52:22.149
but I'm merely trying
to point out the fact

995
00:52:22.219 --> 00:52:25.052
that the success of our enterprise
is at stake.


996
00:52:25.122 --> 00:52:27.181
I want you to...

997
00:52:31.028 --> 00:52:32.552
Cooperate.

998
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:34.393
I want you to leave.

999
00:52:35.499 --> 00:52:37.296
All right, I'll go.

1000
00:52:38.202 --> 00:52:41.433
But if I'm going to go anyway,
I guess I might as well spill it.


1001
00:52:41.505 --> 00:52:43.769
Spill it? Spill what?

1002
00:52:43.841 --> 00:52:45.604
Why do you suppose
I came here in the first place?


1003
00:52:45.676 --> 00:52:46.734
To help with the research.

1004
00:52:46.811 --> 00:52:48.802
- I did not. I came on account of you.
- Me?


1005
00:52:48.879 --> 00:52:50.813
And not on account of
you needed some slang.


1006
00:52:50.881 --> 00:52:52.576
On account of
because I wanted to see you again.


1007
00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:55.244
Miss O'Shea, the construction
"on account of because"


1008
00:52:55.319 --> 00:52:57.014
outrages every grammatical law.

1009
00:52:57.087 --> 00:52:59.885
So what? I came on account of
because I couldn't stop thinking about you


1010
00:52:59.957 --> 00:53:01.720
after you left my dressing room.

1011
00:53:01.792 --> 00:53:06.354
On account of because I thought
you were big and cute and pretty.


1012
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:07.761
- Pretty?
- Yeah, I mean you.


1013
00:53:07.832 --> 00:53:11.199
Maybe I'm just crazy, but to me,
you're a regular yum-yum type.


1014
00:53:11.268 --> 00:53:13.259
- Yum-yum?
- Yeah, don't you know what that means?


1015
00:53:13.337 --> 00:53:14.395
No, we never got to that.

1016
00:53:14.472 --> 00:53:16.167
Well, we've got to it now,
and I'm glad it's out.


1017
00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.969
I don't give a whoop
whether the others went for me.


1018
00:53:18.042 --> 00:53:19.907
You're the one I'm wacky about,
just plain wacky.


1019
00:53:19.977 --> 00:53:21.740
- Can you understand that?
- Please, Miss O'Shea.


1020
00:53:21.812 --> 00:53:23.973
Oh, please, nothing.
Maybe you can generate or whatever it is


1021
00:53:24.048 --> 00:53:26.312
for all that suppress business, but...

1022
00:53:26.383 --> 00:53:28.681
I can't. No, you're too tall.

1023
00:53:31.422 --> 00:53:32.684
- What are you doing?
- You'll find out.


1024
00:53:32.756 --> 00:53:34.348
Those are Professor Gurkakoff's
reference books.


1025
00:53:34.425 --> 00:53:36.484
- Now, isn't that just too bad!
- And they're very...


1026
00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.152
- That's perfect.
- What are you going to do?


1027
00:53:38.229 --> 00:53:40.993
Come here,
I'm going to show you what yum-yum is.


1028
00:53:41.065 --> 00:53:42.430
Here's yum.

1029
00:53:43.968 --> 00:53:45.799
Here's the other yum.

1030
00:53:47.805 --> 00:53:49.568
And here's yum-yum.

1031
00:53:53.444 --> 00:53:54.775
Excuse me.

1032
00:53:55.513 --> 00:53:56.537
Hey, where are you going?

1033
00:54:08.025 --> 00:54:11.085
Did you see?
He practically stepped on my hand.


1034
00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:12.992
- Three steps at a time.
- Shot out of a gun.


1035
00:54:13.063 --> 00:54:14.724
- But where is he going?
- Why?


1036
00:54:14.798 --> 00:54:18.495
To get a razor strop, I hope,
and I hope he knows where to apply it.


1037
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.342
- Well, Professor Potts?
- Yes, Miss Bragg.


1038
00:54:27.411 --> 00:54:30.710
Will one of you call a taxi
from the corner for Miss O'Shea?


1039
00:54:31.382 --> 00:54:33.373
- Right away.
- Thank you.


1040
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:41.656
- Fine business.
- I beg your pardon?


1041
00:54:41.725 --> 00:54:43.352
What's the idea of
running out on me like that?


1042
00:54:43.427 --> 00:54:45.520
Nothing, nothing.

1043
00:54:46.096 --> 00:54:49.156
The last few minutes
only confirmed my former decision.


1044
00:54:49.233 --> 00:54:51.224
Your further presence here would be fatal.

1045
00:54:51.302 --> 00:54:54.863
You must get me out of your mind
just as I must get you out of this house.


1046
00:54:54.939 --> 00:54:58.306
- Your hair's wet.
- Well, never mind, please.


1047
00:54:58.375 --> 00:55:00.866
- Well, it is wet.
- Well, what of it?


1048
00:55:00.945 --> 00:55:02.173
Nothing, I just happened to mention it.

1049
00:55:02.246 --> 00:55:04.840
- Well, forget it, please.
- Okay, okay.


1050
00:55:05.549 --> 00:55:08.575
Now to get back to the subject
under discussion.


1051
00:55:08.652 --> 00:55:12.019
It would be idle of me to deny that I, too,
feel the affinity


1052
00:55:12.089 --> 00:55:15.456
that you mentioned a few minutes ago,
very strongly.


1053
00:55:15.526 --> 00:55:17.391
After three years,
when my work is finished,


1054
00:55:17.461 --> 00:55:20.259
perhaps we can take
up where we left off.

1055
00:55:20.331 --> 00:55:25.268
In the meantime, I hope we can keep up
some sort of correspondence.


1056
00:55:26.503 --> 00:55:30.599
- Would you, Miss Sugarpuss?
- Oh, Pottsy.


1057
00:55:31.909 --> 00:55:35.174
I know that's the way I feel, too,
but it has to be.


1058
00:55:36.714 --> 00:55:41.048
Sugarpuss, before you go, would you...

1059
00:55:47.791 --> 00:55:49.258
Would you

1060
00:55:50.794 --> 00:55:52.694
yum me just once more?

1061
00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:02.766
- It seems so unnecessary.
- Yes.


1062
00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.467
- Yes.
- The taxi's here.


1063
00:56:04.575 --> 00:56:06.065
I'll tell him.

1064
00:56:11.448 --> 00:56:14.940
Professor Potts,
the taxi for that young woman is here.


1065
00:56:17.054 --> 00:56:18.351
The taxi.
