00:00:19.948 --> 00:00:23.452
<i>This is the night</i>

2
00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:27.122
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

3
00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.296
<i>And they call it bella notte</i>

4
00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:37.391
<i>Look at the skies</i>

5
00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:41.270
<i>They have stars in their eyes</i>

6
00:00:41.428 --> 00:00:47.561
<i>On this lovely bella notte</i>

7
00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:51.272
<i>So take the love</i>

8
00:00:51.438 --> 00:00:54.783
<i>Of your loved one</i>

9
00:00:54.941 --> 00:01:00.823
<i>You'll need it about this time</i>

10
00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:07.247
<i>To keep from falling like a star</i>

11
00:01:07.412 --> 00:01:11.462
<i>When you make that dizzy climb</i>

12
00:01:11.625 --> 00:01:17.132
<i>For this is the night</i>

13
00:01:17.297 --> 00:01:22.428
<i>And the heavens are right</i>

14
00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:26.023
<i>On this lovely</i>

15
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:31.062
<i>Bella notte</i>

16
00:01:32.854 --> 00:01:35.573
<i>On this lovely</i>

17
00:01:35.732 --> 00:01:41.910
<i>Bella notte</i>

18
00:02:05.512 --> 00:02:10.564
<i>Silent as a snowﬂake in the night</i>

19
00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:15.356
<i>Holy is the spirit of this night</i>

20
00:02:15.522 --> 00:02:20.323
<i>All the world is calm and peaceful</i>

21
00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:25.161
<i>All the world is bright and joyful</i>

22
00:02:25.323 --> 00:02:29.294
<i>Spirit of love</i>

23
00:02:29.452 --> 00:02:35.084
<i>And child of peace</i>

24
00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:39.630
<i>Love unending</i>

25
00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:45.474
<i>That shall not cease</i>

26
00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:50.812
<i>Peace, my children</i>

27
00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:55.821
<i>Of good will</i>

28
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:58.740
<i>Peace, my children</i>

29
00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:04.906
<i>Peace, be still</i>

30
00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:09.459
It's for you, darling.

31
00:03:09.618 --> 00:03:10.961
Merry Christmas.

32
00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:12.996
Oh, Jim, dear.

33
00:03:13.163 --> 00:03:15.382
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?

34
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.417
Trimmed with ribbons?

35
00:03:17.584 --> 00:03:21.134
Well, it has a ribbon.

36
00:03:22.923 --> 00:03:26.052
Oh, how sweet.

37
00:03:26.217 --> 00:03:28.720
- You like her, darling?
- Oh, I love her.


38
00:03:32.724 --> 00:03:35.853
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.

39
00:03:46.571 --> 00:03:48.699
Come on, Lady. Over here.

40
00:03:50.742 --> 00:03:52.369
That's a girl.

41
00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.709
There, now.
A nice little bed for you.


42
00:03:57.874 --> 00:04:01.003
But Jim, dear, are you sure
she'll be warm enough?


43
00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.389
Why, of course, darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a...


44
00:04:05.674 --> 00:04:07.472
Almost forgot something.

45
00:04:08.593 --> 00:04:10.470
There.

46
00:04:10.637 --> 00:04:11.889
Good night, Lady.

47
00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:13.728
Now, now, don't worry, darling.

48
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.642
She'll go right to sleep.

49
00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:19.237
No, no, Lady.

50
00:04:21.606 --> 00:04:25.156
This is where you belong, right here.

51
00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.093
Aw, look. She's lonesome.

52
00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:49.180
Don't you think maybe...?
Just for tonight?


53
00:04:49.342 --> 00:04:52.221
Now, darling, if we're going
to show her who's master,


54
00:04:52.387 --> 00:04:54.515
we must be firm
from the very beginning.


55
00:05:30.258 --> 00:05:31.601
Lady!

56
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.932
Stop that now!

57
00:05:33.094 --> 00:05:34.516
Stop it!

58
00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:55.743
Lady! Quiet, now. You hear me?

59
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:57.502
Back to bed!

60
00:05:57.994 --> 00:05:59.416
Quick, now.

61
00:06:00.705 --> 00:06:03.003
Not one more sound.

62
00:07:00.598 --> 00:07:01.770
Jim, dear.

63
00:07:09.482 --> 00:07:11.029
Aw, Jim.

64
00:07:11.192 --> 00:07:12.409
What?

65
00:07:20.201 --> 00:07:22.044
Oh, all right.

66
00:07:23.204 --> 00:07:25.923
But remember, just for tonight.

67
00:08:08.041 --> 00:08:10.385
All right, Lady. All right.

68
00:08:10.543 --> 00:08:13.262
I'm up. I'm up, Lady. I...

69
00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:15.765
Oh, no!

70
00:08:15.924 --> 00:08:17.517
What's wrong, Jim? What is it?

71
00:08:17.675 --> 00:08:20.474
Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays?

72
00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:35.804
Have you noticed, darling,
since we've had Lady,


73
00:09:35.962 --> 00:09:39.637
we see less and less
of those disturbing headlines?


74
00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:43.895
Yes, I just don't know
how we ever got along without her.


75
00:09:44.637 --> 00:09:47.516
Say, she must be about six months old.

76
00:09:47.682 --> 00:09:49.605
We'd better be getting her a license.

77
00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:06.121
Hope it fits.

78
00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:09.830
My, but it does look nice.

79
00:10:09.996 --> 00:10:11.293
So grown up.

80
00:10:11.456 --> 00:10:14.084
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?

81
00:10:30.141 --> 00:10:33.315
<i>Four steps straight
and then to the left</i>


82
00:10:33.478 --> 00:10:37.233
<i>And right to the place
where I marked it</i>


83
00:10:37.398 --> 00:10:41.278
<i>With a bonnie, bonnie bone
that I buried for me own</i>


84
00:10:41.444 --> 00:10:45.449
<i>In my bonnie, bonnie bank
in the backyard</i>


85
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:49.202
That's a grand sight.

86
00:10:49.369 --> 00:10:50.495
Jock!

87
00:10:52.372 --> 00:10:54.215
Oh, Jock!

88
00:11:00.046 --> 00:11:01.673
Hello, Jock.

89
00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:04.638
Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie.

90
00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:06.769
Notice anything different?

91
00:11:08.054 --> 00:11:09.977
You've had a bath?

92
00:11:10.139 --> 00:11:11.641
No, not that.

93
00:11:11.808 --> 00:11:13.981
You've had your nails clipped?

94
00:11:15.353 --> 00:11:17.105
Guess again.

95
00:11:17.563 --> 00:11:21.033
Well, I wouldn't a-be a-knowin'.

96
00:11:24.237 --> 00:11:25.830
Why, lassie.

97
00:11:25.988 --> 00:11:27.865
A bonnie new collar.

98
00:11:28.032 --> 00:11:30.251
- Do you like it?
- Aye.


99
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.498
It must be very expensive.

100
00:11:35.373 --> 00:11:37.717
- Have you shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.


101
00:11:37.875 --> 00:11:40.424
We'd best go at once.

102
00:11:40.586 --> 00:11:43.840
You know how sensitive
he is about these things.


103
00:12:04.026 --> 00:12:05.744
He's dreaming.

104
00:12:05.903 --> 00:12:06.995
Aye.

105
00:12:07.155 --> 00:12:09.408
Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days

106
00:12:09.574 --> 00:12:12.703
when he and his grandfather
were trackin' criminals


107
00:12:12.869 --> 00:12:14.371
through the swamps.

108
00:12:14.537 --> 00:12:17.381
- They were?
- But that was before...


109
00:12:18.416 --> 00:12:19.963
Before what?

110
00:12:20.543 --> 00:12:23.513
'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie.

111
00:12:23.671 --> 00:12:26.299
It shouldn't have happened to a dog.

112
00:12:26.466 --> 00:12:29.015
<i>But, well...</i>

113
00:12:29.177 --> 00:12:32.101
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.

114
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:35.024
<i>' No!
' Aye.</i>


115
00:12:35.725 --> 00:12:38.478
But we must never let on
that we know, lassie.


116
00:12:39.479 --> 00:12:42.449
It would break his poor heart

117
00:12:50.406 --> 00:12:53.205
Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?


118
00:12:53.367 --> 00:12:56.291
- Go?
- Yeah, big fella.


119
00:12:56.454 --> 00:12:58.206
About six-foot-two.

120
00:12:59.248 --> 00:13:00.670
No, three.

121
00:13:00.833 --> 00:13:03.586
Wore a striped suit. No collar.

122
00:13:04.587 --> 00:13:07.887
Why, Miss Lady.

123
00:13:08.049 --> 00:13:10.222
You have a collar.

124
00:13:11.552 --> 00:13:12.769
And a license.

125
00:13:12.929 --> 00:13:14.727
<i>My, my.</i>

126
00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:18.063
- How time does fly.
- Aye.


127
00:13:18.226 --> 00:13:20.604
It seems only yesterday
she was cuttin' her teeth


128
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.488
on Jim Dear's slippers,

129
00:13:22.647 --> 00:13:26.743
and now there she is, a full-grown lady.

130
00:13:26.901 --> 00:13:31.372
Wearin' the greatest honor
man can bestow.


131
00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:34.000
The badge of faith and respectability.

132
00:13:35.535 --> 00:13:37.913
That's right, Miss Lady.

133
00:13:38.079 --> 00:13:42.084
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...


134
00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:45.754
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.


135
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.173
Aye, you have, laddie.

136
00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:50.182
Oh, yeah.

137
00:13:51.592 --> 00:13:53.219
It's Jim Dear.

138
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.642
Please excuse me.

139
00:13:59.517 --> 00:14:01.144
Hello, there, Lady.

140
00:14:01.894 --> 00:14:03.737
Come on, beat you home.

141
00:14:10.278 --> 00:14:11.951
You win again.

142
00:14:12.113 --> 00:14:13.330
Steady, now.

143
00:14:13.489 --> 00:14:15.241
Steady.

144
00:14:15.783 --> 00:14:17.535
Well, what have we here?

145
00:14:19.036 --> 00:14:20.413
Big girl now, huh?

146
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:21.581
All right.

147
00:14:22.707 --> 00:14:24.334
Ladies first.

148
00:14:30.298 --> 00:14:32.175
You know, darling, with Lady here,

149
00:14:32.341 --> 00:14:34.969
I'd say life is quite complete.

150
00:14:35.136 --> 00:14:36.308
Yes, dear.

151
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.225
I don't imagine anything could
ever take her place in our hearts.


152
00:15:24.977 --> 00:15:26.979
What a day!

153
00:15:27.146 --> 00:15:30.275
Well, now to dig up some breakfast.

154
00:15:43.204 --> 00:15:45.548
Cute little rascals.

155
00:15:50.795 --> 00:15:53.890
Now. That breakfast, let's see.

156
00:15:54.632 --> 00:15:55.758
Bernie's?

157
00:15:57.385 --> 00:15:59.979
No. Francois...

158
00:16:00.137 --> 00:16:01.434
No, no.

159
00:16:01.597 --> 00:16:03.224
Nope. Too much starch.

160
00:16:04.016 --> 00:16:06.110
Tony's. Oh, that's it.

161
00:16:07.311 --> 00:16:08.938
I haven't been there in a week.

162
00:16:10.314 --> 00:16:12.988
<i>A beautiful day to make pizza</i>

163
00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.326
<i>Hey, still we call it bella notte</i>

164
00:16:19.156 --> 00:16:22.160
Well, buon giorno, Butch.

165
00:16:22.326 --> 00:16:24.704
You want-a your breakfast?

166
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:28.841
OK. The boss, he's a-saving
some a-nice bones for you.


167
00:16:29.542 --> 00:16:32.386
Breakfast comin' up from a-left field.

168
00:16:33.587 --> 00:16:35.009
Good catch!

169
00:16:41.262 --> 00:16:42.889
Whoa, boy, whoa.

170
00:17:18.966 --> 00:17:19.967
Hey.

171
00:17:23.053 --> 00:17:24.270
Blimey.

172
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.649
Look, Peg, it's the tramp.

173
00:17:27.558 --> 00:17:30.402
Hiya, handsome.
Come to join the party?


174
00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:32.689
All right, all right.
No time for wisecracks.


175
00:17:32.855 --> 00:17:34.277
I've got to get you out.

176
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:37.694
I'm telling you, the pressure's
really on. Signs all over town.


177
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:41.581
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.


178
00:17:41.739 --> 00:17:44.663
- OK, OK, get going.
- Hey! What's going on over there?


179
00:17:44.825 --> 00:17:47.669
Scram. And be careful.

180
00:17:49.413 --> 00:17:50.665
WW, you mangy mutt.

181
00:17:50.831 --> 00:17:52.833
Hey. Let go. Let go of me.

182
00:18:12.937 --> 00:18:15.565
Well. Snob hill!

183
00:18:19.276 --> 00:18:21.449
Hi, gals. How's pickings?

184
00:18:23.239 --> 00:18:24.991
Pretty slim?

185
00:18:25.157 --> 00:18:28.832
Yeah. I'll bet they've got
a lid on every trash can.


186
00:18:30.454 --> 00:18:32.798
And a fence around every tree.

187
00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.005
I wonder what the leash and collar set
does for excitement.


188
00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:47.184
Lassie. Lassie!

189
00:18:48.305 --> 00:18:51.559
Miss Lady, ma'am.

190
00:18:52.476 --> 00:18:56.231
Miss Lady!

191
00:18:56.397 --> 00:18:58.240
Good morning, lassie.

192
00:18:58.399 --> 00:19:00.822
'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day...

193
00:19:01.777 --> 00:19:03.029
...day.

194
00:19:03.195 --> 00:19:05.448
Why, Miss Lady.

195
00:19:05.614 --> 00:19:07.412
Is something wrong?

196
00:19:07.575 --> 00:19:09.122
Aye. Tell us, lassie.

197
00:19:09.285 --> 00:19:12.539
- If somebody's been mistreatin' <i>ya...</i>
- No, Jock.


198
00:19:12.705 --> 00:19:15.584
It's something I've done, I guess.

199
00:19:15.749 --> 00:19:17.342
You?

200
00:19:17.501 --> 00:19:19.003
It must be.

201
00:19:19.169 --> 00:19:22.639
Jim Dear and Darling are acting <i>so...</i>

202
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.811
- Jim Dear and Darling?
- Hush, lad.


203
00:19:39.899 --> 00:19:43.324
Now, lassie,
get on with the details.


204
00:19:43.485 --> 00:19:45.863
Well, I first noticed it

205
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:48.749
the other day
when Jim Dear came home.


206
00:19:59.752 --> 00:20:00.924
Down, Lady, down!

207
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:08.052
Darling, darling!

208
00:20:08.218 --> 00:20:09.640
Are you all right?

209
00:20:09.803 --> 00:20:12.306
Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?


210
00:20:17.895 --> 00:20:19.897
I just can't help worrying.

211
00:20:20.064 --> 00:20:21.907
After all, in your condition,

212
00:20:22.066 --> 00:20:23.318
alone here all day,

213
00:20:23.484 --> 00:20:25.657
and walking that dog...

214
00:20:26.445 --> 00:20:29.415
- That dog!
- That dog?


215
00:20:29.573 --> 00:20:32.076
He's never called me that before.

216
00:20:32.242 --> 00:20:34.040
Well, now, lassie,

217
00:20:34.203 --> 00:20:36.672
I wouldn't worry
my wee head about that.


218
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.674
Remember,
they're only humans, after all.


219
00:20:39.833 --> 00:20:42.131
That's right, Miss Lady.

220
00:20:42.294 --> 00:20:46.299
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...


221
00:20:46.465 --> 00:20:50.095
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.


222
00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.355
Aye, you have, laddie.

223
00:20:53.514 --> 00:20:55.892
- Frequently.
- Yeah.


224
00:20:56.058 --> 00:20:58.732
But now Darling <i>is... Well...</i>

225
00:20:58.894 --> 00:21:02.239
We've always enjoyed
our afternoon romp together.


226
00:21:02.398 --> 00:21:03.650
But yesterday...

227
00:21:19.498 --> 00:21:22.502
No, Lady. No walk today.

228
00:21:32.886 --> 00:21:34.138
No, Lady.

229
00:21:34.888 --> 00:21:35.935
Not now.

230
00:21:38.017 --> 00:21:39.143
Lady!

231
00:21:39.727 --> 00:21:41.149
Drop that, Lady.

232
00:21:42.146 --> 00:21:43.819
Drop it, I say.

233
00:21:45.816 --> 00:21:48.035
It didn't hurt, really

234
00:21:48.193 --> 00:21:51.618
But Darling has never
struck me... before.


235
00:21:53.991 --> 00:21:55.368
Now, lassie.

236
00:21:55.534 --> 00:21:57.582
Do not take it too seriously.

237
00:21:57.745 --> 00:21:59.793
After all, at a time like this...

238
00:21:59.955 --> 00:22:03.255
Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady,

239
00:22:03.417 --> 00:22:07.843
there comes a time
in the life of all humans when...


240
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.850
Well, as they put it...

241
00:22:12.009 --> 00:22:14.307
Birds and the bees?

242
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.689
Or... Well...

243
00:22:16.847 --> 00:22:20.147
The stork? You know... No?

244
00:22:20.309 --> 00:22:23.279
- Well...
- What he's trying to say, lassie,


245
00:22:23.437 --> 00:22:26.987
is Darling is expecting a wee bairn.

246
00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:28.321
Bairn?

247
00:22:28.484 --> 00:22:31.363
He means a baby, Miss Lady.

248
00:22:31.528 --> 00:22:33.121
Oh.

249
00:22:33.906 --> 00:22:35.954
What's a baby?

250
00:22:36.116 --> 00:22:38.744
Well, they resemble humans.

251
00:22:38.911 --> 00:22:42.006
But I'd say a mite smaller.

252
00:22:42.164 --> 00:22:44.337
Aye. And they walk on all fours.

253
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.596
And if I remember correctly,
they bellow a lot.


254
00:22:48.754 --> 00:22:51.382
Aye. And they're very expensive.

255
00:22:52.132 --> 00:22:53.884
You will not be permitted
to play with it.


256
00:22:54.051 --> 00:22:56.474
But they're mighty sweet.

257
00:22:56.637 --> 00:22:59.356
And very, very soft.

258
00:22:59.515 --> 00:23:01.734
Just a cute little bundle.

259
00:23:02.768 --> 00:23:03.860
Of trouble.

260
00:23:04.186 --> 00:23:06.689
Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears...

261
00:23:07.481 --> 00:23:10.109
But shucks. Any dog can take that.

262
00:23:10.275 --> 00:23:12.369
It's what they do to your happy home.

263
00:23:12.528 --> 00:23:13.905
Move it over, will you, friend?

264
00:23:14.071 --> 00:23:15.789
Homewreckers, that's what they are.

265
00:23:15.948 --> 00:23:17.916
Look here.
Who are you to barge in?


266
00:23:18.075 --> 00:23:20.578
The voice of experience, buster.

267
00:23:21.995 --> 00:23:24.919
Just wait till junior gets here.

268
00:23:25.082 --> 00:23:27.631
You get the urge
for a nice comfortable scratch,


269
00:23:27.793 --> 00:23:30.046
and, "Put that dog out!

270
00:23:30.212 --> 00:23:32.214
He'll get fleas all over the baby."

271
00:23:32.881 --> 00:23:35.009
You start barking
at some strange mutt


272
00:23:37.094 --> 00:23:39.563
"Stop that racket.
You'll wake the baby."


273
00:23:40.222 --> 00:23:41.394
And then!

274
00:23:41.557 --> 00:23:44.811
Then they hit you in the room
and board department.


275
00:23:45.936 --> 00:23:49.031
Remember those nice,
juicy cuts of beef?


276
00:23:51.066 --> 00:23:52.659
<i>Forget them.</i>

277
00:23:52.818 --> 00:23:55.287
<i>Leftover baby food.</i>

278
00:23:55.445 --> 00:23:57.698
<i>And that nice,
warm bed by the fire?</i>


279
00:24:03.954 --> 00:24:06.002
<i>A leaky doghouse.</i>

280
00:24:06.165 --> 00:24:08.259
- Oh, dear.
- Do not listen, lassie.


281
00:24:08.417 --> 00:24:10.044
No human is that cruel.

282
00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.588
Of course not, Miss Lady.

283
00:24:12.754 --> 00:24:15.132
Why, everybody knows

284
00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:18.894
a dog's best friend is his human.

285
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.268
Come on now, fellas.

286
00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.268
You haven't fallen
for that old line, now have you?


287
00:24:25.434 --> 00:24:28.313
Aye. And we've no need for mongrels

288
00:24:28.478 --> 00:24:30.606
and their radical ideas.

289
00:24:30.772 --> 00:24:32.399
Off with you, now. Off with you!

290
00:24:32.566 --> 00:24:34.068
- OK, Sandy.
- The name's Jock.


291
00:24:34.234 --> 00:24:36.487
- OK, Jock.
- Heather Lad of Glencairn to you!


292
00:24:36.653 --> 00:24:38.951
OK, OK, OK.

293
00:24:39.114 --> 00:24:40.787
But remember this, Pigeon.

294
00:24:40.949 --> 00:24:44.544
A human heart has only so much
room for love and affection.


295
00:24:44.995 --> 00:24:47.214
When a baby moves in,

296
00:24:47.372 --> 00:24:49.966
the dog moves out.

297
00:24:56.256 --> 00:24:59.305
Let's see. That'll be about...

298
00:25:00.802 --> 00:25:02.725
Oh, well.

299
00:25:09.353 --> 00:25:10.479
Darling?

300
00:25:11.313 --> 00:25:15.193
There isn't any way we can tell, for
sure, what it's going to be, is there?


301
00:25:15.359 --> 00:25:19.705
I'm afraid not.
Nobody ever knows for certain.


302
00:25:19.863 --> 00:25:22.537
All we can do is hope.

303
00:25:48.308 --> 00:25:52.029
Darling, are you sure
you want watermelon?


304
00:25:54.648 --> 00:25:56.241
And some chop suey too.

305
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.949
Chop su...

306
00:25:59.111 --> 00:26:01.205
All right, darling.

307
00:26:12.082 --> 00:26:14.926
- That's the cutest thing I ever saw.
- What darling little booties!


308
00:26:15.085 --> 00:26:17.508
- That bonnet.
- Isn't it just too adorable?


309
00:26:17.671 --> 00:26:19.344
Don't you love showers?

310
00:26:19.506 --> 00:26:21.679
I've never seen you look more beautiful.

311
00:26:21.842 --> 00:26:23.185
Isn't she radiant?

312
00:26:23.343 --> 00:26:25.311
That's what I told Bill yesterday.

313
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:27.814
"Darling looks positively radiant.

314
00:26:27.973 --> 00:26:31.568
Why, in all my days," I said,
"I've never seen anyone as radiant."


315
00:26:35.188 --> 00:26:36.610
Jim, you look terrible.

316
00:26:36.773 --> 00:26:38.366
Absolutely horrible.

317
00:26:38.525 --> 00:26:40.653
I never saw you look worse.

318
00:26:40.819 --> 00:26:45.416
Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones
has never lost a father yet.


319
00:26:56.335 --> 00:26:58.212
Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's a boy.

320
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.423
A boy. And... What's that?

321
00:27:02.215 --> 00:27:04.809
Eyes?
What color are they?


322
00:27:04.968 --> 00:27:06.220
Well, oh, gosh.

323
00:27:06.386 --> 00:27:08.013
I forgot to look.

324
00:27:09.431 --> 00:27:12.401
A boy. It's a boy, it's a... Doctor!

325
00:27:13.393 --> 00:27:15.395
Doctor, it's a boy!

326
00:27:15.562 --> 00:27:17.530
Yes, yes, I know.

327
00:27:17.689 --> 00:27:18.815
A boy.

328
00:27:18.982 --> 00:27:20.325
Oh, boy, oh, boy!

329
00:27:20.484 --> 00:27:22.452
It's a boy, it's
a boy, it's a boy!

330
00:27:22.611 --> 00:27:24.488
<i>Hello? Hello, Jim?</i>

331
00:27:24.654 --> 00:27:26.076
<i>Are you there, Jim?</i>

332
00:27:26.239 --> 00:27:28.833
<i>Central, we've been cutoff.</i>

333
00:27:28.992 --> 00:27:30.335
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

334
00:27:30.494 --> 00:27:32.121
<i>Hello!</i>

335
00:28:01.566 --> 00:28:03.614
<i>What is a baby?</i>

336
00:28:04.486 --> 00:28:07.706
<i>I just can't understand</i>

337
00:28:09.116 --> 00:28:13.337
<i>It must be something wonderful</i>

338
00:28:13.495 --> 00:28:17.045
<i>It must be something grand</i>

339
00:28:18.291 --> 00:28:22.091
<i>'Cause everybody's smiling</i>

340
00:28:22.254 --> 00:28:26.680
<i>In a kind and wistful way</i>

341
00:28:26.842 --> 00:28:31.188
<i>And they haven't even noticed</i>

342
00:28:31.346 --> 00:28:35.101
<i>That I'm around today</i>

343
00:28:46.903 --> 00:28:49.281
<i>What is a baby, anyway?</i>

344
00:28:52.409 --> 00:28:55.208
<i>What is a baby?</i>

345
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.044
<i>I must find out today</i>

346
00:28:58.206 --> 00:29:02.461
<i>What makes Jim Dear and Darling</i>

347
00:29:02.627 --> 00:29:08.475
<i>Act this way?</i>

348
00:29:22.939 --> 00:29:27.490
<i>Oh, my little star sweeper</i>

349
00:29:27.652 --> 00:29:31.498
<i>I'll sweep the stardust</i>

350
00:29:31.656 --> 00:29:34.125
<i>For you</i>

351
00:29:39.998 --> 00:29:44.504
<i>Little soft ﬂuffy sleeper</i>

352
00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:49.095
<i>Here comes a pink cloud</i>

353
00:29:49.257 --> 00:29:51.760
<i>For you</i>

354
00:29:58.266 --> 00:30:03.193
<i>Little wandering angel</i>

355
00:30:03.355 --> 00:30:06.700
<i>Fold up your wings</i>

356
00:30:06.858 --> 00:30:10.328
<i>Close your eyes</i>

357
00:30:15.825 --> 00:30:20.626
<i>And may love be your keeper</i>

358
00:30:34.261 --> 00:30:35.683
There, now.

359
00:30:35.845 --> 00:30:37.893
Little star sweeper.

360
00:30:38.056 --> 00:30:39.524
Dream on.

361
00:30:53.405 --> 00:30:55.328
Well, that should do it.

362
00:30:56.157 --> 00:30:58.626
We've got enough here
to take us halfway to China.


363
00:31:03.456 --> 00:31:06.426
Darling. Darling!

364
00:31:06.585 --> 00:31:08.508
We haven't much time.

365
00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:10.889
Jim, I just can't leave him.

366
00:31:11.047 --> 00:31:13.141
He's still so small and helpless.

367
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:14.973
He'll be all right.

368
00:31:15.135 --> 00:31:18.810
Now come on. If he wakes up,
we'll never get away.


369
00:31:18.972 --> 00:31:21.191
Jim, I feel so guilty
deserting him like this.


370
00:31:21.349 --> 00:31:23.147
Nonsense.

371
00:31:25.395 --> 00:31:28.239
Hey. What's the matter with Lady?

372
00:31:28.398 --> 00:31:31.117
She thinks we're running out on him.

373
00:31:32.277 --> 00:31:33.574
Don't worry, old girl.

374
00:31:33.737 --> 00:31:35.990
We'll be back in a few days.

375
00:31:36.156 --> 00:31:37.499
And Aunt Sarah will be here.

376
00:31:37.657 --> 00:31:40.126
With you here to help her...

377
00:31:40.285 --> 00:31:41.912
There's the old girl now.

378
00:31:42.912 --> 00:31:45.836
Coming, Aunt Sarah. Coming!

379
00:31:45.999 --> 00:31:48.878
Sorry I'm late, dears.
Hope I haven't kept you waiting.


380
00:31:49.044 --> 00:31:50.762
- Let me take your things.
- No.


381
00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.298
No fussing. I know my way around.

382
00:31:53.465 --> 00:31:55.559
On your way.
Mustn't miss your train.


383
00:31:55.717 --> 00:31:58.345
Have a good time,
and don't worry about a thing.


384
00:31:58.511 --> 00:32:00.263
Goodbye, dears. Goodbye.

385
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:02.558
Goodbye.

386
00:32:02.724 --> 00:32:05.443
Now to see that big nephew of mine.

387
00:32:17.447 --> 00:32:19.666
You adorable little...

388
00:32:19.824 --> 00:32:22.077
Good gracious!
What are you doing here?


389
00:32:22.243 --> 00:32:24.962
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo.
Scat. Get out of here.


390
00:32:26.247 --> 00:32:27.590
There, there.

391
00:32:27.749 --> 00:32:31.720
Aunt Sarah won't let
that dog frighten you any more.


392
00:32:31.878 --> 00:32:34.506
No, no, no.

393
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:42.648
<i>Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop</i>

394
00:32:42.806 --> 00:32:45.104
<i>When the wind blows</i>

395
00:33:16.423 --> 00:33:20.269
<i>We are Siamese if you please</i>

396
00:33:21.845 --> 00:33:27.102
<i>We are Siamese if you don't please</i>

397
00:33:27.267 --> 00:33:32.444
<i>Now we looking over our new domicile</i>

398
00:33:32.605 --> 00:33:36.485
<i>If we like we stay
for maybe quite a while</i>


399
00:33:48.747 --> 00:33:52.923
Do you seeing that thing
swimming round and round?


400
00:33:53.084 --> 00:33:54.427
Yes.

401
00:33:55.128 --> 00:33:58.302
Maybe we could reaching in
and make it drown.


402
00:34:00.341 --> 00:34:03.390
If we sneaking up upon it carefully...

403
00:34:05.054 --> 00:34:07.273
<i>There will be a head for you</i>

404
00:34:07.432 --> 00:34:09.480
<i>A tail for me</i>

405
00:34:32.624 --> 00:34:34.672
Do you hear what I hear?

406
00:34:35.668 --> 00:34:37.887
A baby CW-

407
00:34:38.046 --> 00:34:41.596
<i>Where we finding baby
there are milk nearby</i>


408
00:34:43.009 --> 00:34:46.730
<i>If we look in baby buggy
there could be</i>


409
00:34:48.056 --> 00:34:52.436
<i>Plenty milk for you
and also some for me</i>


410
00:35:02.529 --> 00:35:04.031
What's going on down there?

411
00:35:05.448 --> 00:35:07.951
Merciful heavens! My darlings.

412
00:35:08.117 --> 00:35:10.119
My precious pets.

413
00:35:11.871 --> 00:35:14.044
That wicked animal.

414
00:35:14.207 --> 00:35:18.883
Attacking my poor,
innocent little angels.


415
00:35:23.299 --> 00:35:24.676
Good afternoon, ma'am.

416
00:35:24.843 --> 00:35:26.641
What can I do for you?

417
00:35:26.803 --> 00:35:29.397
I want a muzzle.
A good, strong muzzle.


418
00:35:29.556 --> 00:35:32.059
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Now here's our latest.


419
00:35:32.225 --> 00:35:35.024
Combination leash and muzzle.

420
00:35:35.186 --> 00:35:37.234
Now, we'll just slip it on like this,

421
00:35:37.397 --> 00:35:38.819
and... No! No, no, no.

422
00:35:38.982 --> 00:35:41.280
Nice doggy. No, don't wiggle.

423
00:35:41.442 --> 00:35:43.820
Steady, now.
Now... Now, now.


424
00:35:43.987 --> 00:35:45.409
Careful, you little...

425
00:35:45.572 --> 00:35:46.994
Watch out.

426
00:35:47.365 --> 00:35:49.868
- Careful, doggy.
- Come back!


427
00:35:50.034 --> 00:35:52.332
Get over here, I say.
Come back here.


428
00:37:29.133 --> 00:37:32.228
Hey, Pige, what are you doing
on this side of the tracks?


429
00:37:32.387 --> 00:37:33.855
I thought you...

430
00:37:34.013 --> 00:37:35.105
<i>Wh...?</i>

431
00:37:36.557 --> 00:37:39.060
You poor kid.

432
00:37:39.227 --> 00:37:41.571
We've got to get this off.

433
00:37:42.772 --> 00:37:46.117
I think I know the very place.

434
00:37:46.275 --> 00:37:48.118
Come on.

435
00:37:51.364 --> 00:37:52.957
Well, here we are.

436
00:37:53.116 --> 00:37:55.744
- The zoo?
- Sure.


437
00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.668
No, no. This way.

438
00:37:59.831 --> 00:38:01.925
Follow me.

439
00:38:10.675 --> 00:38:12.473
- Oh.
- What's the matter, Pige?


440
00:38:12.635 --> 00:38:15.263
- We can't go in.
- Why not?


441
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:18.400
<i>- The sign says...
- Yeah, that's...</i>


442
00:38:18.558 --> 00:38:20.606
- That's the angle.
- Angle?


443
00:38:20.768 --> 00:38:22.816
Look. We'll wait for the right...

444
00:38:24.981 --> 00:38:26.073
Here we are now.

445
00:38:26.232 --> 00:38:28.234
Just lay low.

446
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:40.288
- Hey, you!
- I beg your pardon.


447
00:38:40.455 --> 00:38:43.800
- Were you addressing...?
- What's the matter? Can't you read?


448
00:38:43.958 --> 00:38:46.086
Why, yes, in several languages.

449
00:38:46.252 --> 00:38:48.596
Oh, a wise guy?

450
00:38:48.755 --> 00:38:52.601
All right, now, what's
this creature doing here?


451
00:38:52.759 --> 00:38:55.353
- He's not my dog.
- He's not?


452
00:38:55.511 --> 00:38:56.603
Go away. Get down.

453
00:38:56.763 --> 00:38:58.686
Go on. Why, certainly not, officer.

454
00:38:58.848 --> 00:39:00.725
I suppose you'll be tellin' me next

455
00:39:00.892 --> 00:39:02.644
it was the dog that was whistling?

456
00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:04.153
I'm certain I don't know.

457
00:39:04.312 --> 00:39:06.440
Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I?

458
00:39:06.606 --> 00:39:08.324
Well, you listen to me.

459
00:39:08.483 --> 00:39:10.656
Resisting an officer of the law.

460
00:39:10.818 --> 00:39:12.115
You're gonna pay.

461
00:39:13.279 --> 00:39:14.701
Pull a knife on me, will you?

462
00:39:14.864 --> 00:39:16.662
Trying to assassinate me, you are.

463
00:39:16.824 --> 00:39:18.622
Carrying concealed weapons.

464
00:39:26.751 --> 00:39:28.003
Come on, Pige.

465
00:39:28.169 --> 00:39:30.342
The place is ours.

466
00:39:35.843 --> 00:39:38.312
We'd better go through
this place from A to Z.


467
00:39:39.972 --> 00:39:41.098
Apes.

468
00:39:42.266 --> 00:39:45.019
No, no. No use even asking them.

469
00:39:45.186 --> 00:39:46.233
They wouldn't understand.

470
00:39:46.395 --> 00:39:47.692
They wouldn't?

471
00:39:48.856 --> 00:39:51.200
Too closely related to humans.

472
00:39:52.068 --> 00:39:54.947
Alligators. Now there's an idea.

473
00:39:55.113 --> 00:39:58.583
Say, Al, do you suppose you could
nip this contraption off for us?


474
00:39:58.741 --> 00:40:01.244
Glad to oblige.

475
00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:03.458
Whoa. Whoa!

476
00:40:14.465 --> 00:40:16.308
If anybody ever needed
a muzzle, it's him.


477
00:40:16.467 --> 00:40:18.185
Timber!

478
00:40:18.344 --> 00:40:20.017
Pigeon, look out!

479
00:40:21.222 --> 00:40:23.224
Now what harebrained idiot would...

480
00:40:23.391 --> 00:40:25.610
Hey, look. A beaver.

481
00:40:28.688 --> 00:40:30.816
There's the answer to our problem.

482
00:40:30.982 --> 00:40:32.655
Let me see here.

483
00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:37.364
Six-foot-six and seven-sixteenth inches.

484
00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:38.702
Pardon me, friend.

485
00:40:39.907 --> 00:40:42.877
- I wonder if you'd do us a little...
- Busy, sonny. Busy.


486
00:40:43.035 --> 00:40:45.083
Can't stop to gossip now.

487
00:40:45.246 --> 00:40:48.090
Got to slide this sycamore to the...

488
00:40:48.249 --> 00:40:49.250
...swamp.

489
00:40:49.417 --> 00:40:51.260
Well, this will only take a second.

490
00:40:51.419 --> 00:40:53.547
Only a second? 
Listen, sonny.

491
00:40:53.713 --> 00:40:57.638
Do you realize every second,

492
00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.723
is wasted over that spillway?

493
00:40:59.886 --> 00:41:03.060
- Yeah, but...
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.


494
00:41:03.222 --> 00:41:04.690
Gotta get it moving.

495
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:07.728
'Taint the cuttin' takes the time.

496
00:41:07.894 --> 00:41:10.443
It's the doggone haulin'.

497
00:41:12.064 --> 00:41:14.112
The haulin'. Exactly.

498
00:41:14.275 --> 00:41:17.654
- Now, what you need...
- I'd better bisect this section here.


499
00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.822
What you need is a log puller.

500
00:41:20.865 --> 00:41:23.744
I said a log puller!

501
00:41:25.328 --> 00:41:27.376
I ain't deaf, sonny.

502
00:41:27.538 --> 00:41:28.881
There's no need to...

503
00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.338
Did you say log puller?

504
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:34.595
And by a lucky coincidence
you see before you,


505
00:41:34.754 --> 00:41:38.258
modeled by the lovely little lady,
the new, improved,


506
00:41:38.424 --> 00:41:42.145
patented, handy dandy,
never-fail little giant log puller.


507
00:41:42.303 --> 00:41:44.271
The busy beaver's friend.

508
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:45.682
You don't say?

509
00:41:45.848 --> 00:41:48.146
Guaranteed not to wear,
tear, rip or ravel.


510
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:50.687
Show the customer the merchandise.

511
00:41:50.853 --> 00:41:54.107
And it cuts log-hauling time 66 percent.

512
00:41:54.899 --> 00:41:57.368
Sixty-six percent?

513
00:41:58.527 --> 00:41:59.779
Think of that.

514
00:41:59.946 --> 00:42:02.495
- Well, how's it work?
- Why, it's no work at all.


515
00:42:02.657 --> 00:42:05.206
You merely slip this ring
over the limb like this


516
00:42:05.368 --> 00:42:06.540
and haul it off.

517
00:42:06.702 --> 00:42:08.079
<i>Say...</i>

518
00:42:08.246 --> 00:42:10.499
You mind if I
slip it on for size?

519
00:42:10.665 --> 00:42:12.508
Help yourself, friend.

520
00:42:12.667 --> 00:42:15.841
OK. Don't mind if I do.

521
00:42:16.963 --> 00:42:19.466
How do you get
the consarned thing off, sonny?


522
00:42:19.632 --> 00:42:22.511
Glad you brought that up.
Glad you brought that up.


523
00:42:22.677 --> 00:42:25.681
To remove it, simply place
the strap between your teeth...


524
00:42:25.846 --> 00:42:27.519
Like this?

525
00:42:27.682 --> 00:42:30.856
Correct, friend. 
Now bite hard.

526
00:42:31.894 --> 00:42:33.487
You see?

527
00:42:33.646 --> 00:42:34.863
It's off.

528
00:42:35.022 --> 00:42:37.491
Say, that is simple.

529
00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:40.904
Well, friend, we'll be
on our way now, so...


530
00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.823
Not so fast now, sonny..

531
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:46.664
I'll have to make
certain it's satisfactory


532
00:42:46.826 --> 00:42:49.170
before we settle on a price.

533
00:42:49.328 --> 00:42:51.080
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.

534
00:42:51.247 --> 00:42:52.294
You can keep it.

535
00:42:53.291 --> 00:42:55.589
I can?

536
00:42:57.044 --> 00:42:58.296
It's a free sample.

537
00:42:59.588 --> 00:43:01.841
Well, thanks a lot.

538
00:43:02.967 --> 00:43:04.310
Thanks ever so...

539
00:43:21.777 --> 00:43:23.370
Say!

540
00:43:23.529 --> 00:43:25.998
It works swell.

541
00:43:29.535 --> 00:43:32.004
But when she put
that horrible muzzle on me...


542
00:43:32.163 --> 00:43:34.757
Say no more.
I get the whole picture.


543
00:43:34.915 --> 00:43:36.542
Aunts. Cats. Muzzles.

544
00:43:36.709 --> 00:43:40.430
Well, that's what comes of tying
yourself down to one family.


545
00:43:40.588 --> 00:43:42.056
Haven't you a family?

546
00:43:42.214 --> 00:43:43.682
One for every day of the week.

547
00:43:43.841 --> 00:43:46.640
The point is, none of them have me.

548
00:43:46.802 --> 00:43:49.305
I'm afraid I don't understand.

549
00:43:49.472 --> 00:43:50.473
It's simple.

550
00:43:50.639 --> 00:43:52.266
You see...

551
00:43:52.433 --> 00:43:53.855
Hey.

552
00:43:55.936 --> 00:43:58.359
Something tells me it's suppertime.

553
00:43:58.522 --> 00:44:00.445
Come on.
I'll show you what I mean.


554
00:44:02.818 --> 00:44:04.161
Take the Schultzes here.

555
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.369
Little Fritzie, that's me, Pige,

556
00:44:07.531 --> 00:44:08.748
makes this his Monday home.

557
00:44:08.908 --> 00:44:11.707
- Monday home?
- Ach, ja.


558
00:44:11.869 --> 00:44:13.212
Monday's is Mama Schultz

559
00:44:13.371 --> 00:44:15.214
<i>cooking der Wiener Schnitzel.</i>

560
00:44:16.791 --> 00:44:18.418
Delicious.

561
00:44:18.584 --> 00:44:21.178
Now, O'Brien's here
is where little Mike,


562
00:44:21.337 --> 00:44:23.339
that's me again, Pige,

563
00:44:23.506 --> 00:44:26.430
- comes of a Tuesday.
- Of a Tuesday?


564
00:44:26.592 --> 00:44:27.718
Begorra.

565
00:44:27.885 --> 00:44:31.560
That's when they're after havin'
their darlin' corned beef.


566
00:44:32.223 --> 00:44:35.568
You see, Pige,
when you're footloose and collar-free,


567
00:44:35.726 --> 00:44:38.946
well, you take nothing but the best.

568
00:44:40.856 --> 00:44:42.449
Hey! Tony's!

569
00:44:42.608 --> 00:44:47.535
Of course. The very place
for a very special occasion.


570
00:44:49.281 --> 00:44:52.205
No, this way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.


571
00:44:57.373 --> 00:44:59.717
Wait here.

572
00:45:02.002 --> 00:45:04.881
Just one minute. I'm a-comin'. I'm...

573
00:45:05.047 --> 00:45:08.221
What's a-matter? Somebody's
a-makin' da April Fool...


574
00:45:09.885 --> 00:45:12.058
Oh, hello, Butch.

575
00:45:12.221 --> 00:45:13.848
Where you been so long?

576
00:45:14.014 --> 00:45:16.062
Hey, Joe, look who's here.

577
00:45:16.225 --> 00:45:19.320
Well, what do you know? It's Butch.

578
00:45:19.478 --> 00:45:21.572
Hey, hey, hey!

579
00:45:21.730 --> 00:45:24.984
Joe, bring some bones
for Butchy before he eat me up.


580
00:45:25.151 --> 00:45:27.028
OK, Tony. OK.

581
00:45:27.194 --> 00:45:28.741
Bones a-coming up.

582
00:45:35.119 --> 00:45:37.292
What's this?

583
00:45:37.455 --> 00:45:39.082
Hey, Joe, look.

584
00:45:39.248 --> 00:45:41.171
Butchy, he's got a new girlfriend.

585
00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:43.131
Well, a son of a gun!

586
00:45:43.294 --> 00:45:45.513
He's a got a cockerel Spanish a-girl.

587
00:45:46.714 --> 00:45:50.093
Hey, she's a pretty sweet kiddo, Butch.

588
00:45:50.259 --> 00:45:54.105
You take-a Tony's advice
and a-settle down with this-a one?


589
00:45:56.432 --> 00:45:57.809
"This a-one?"

590
00:45:57.975 --> 00:45:59.568
This one. This... Oh!

591
00:45:59.727 --> 00:46:01.445
Tony, you know.

592
00:46:01.604 --> 00:46:04.699
He's a-not a-speaking
English a-pretty good.


593
00:46:05.691 --> 00:46:08.945
Now, first we fix-a the table.

594
00:46:09.111 --> 00:46:13.082
- Here's your bones, Tony.
- OK, bones. Bones?


595
00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.414
What's the matter for you, Joe?
I break-a your face.


596
00:46:16.577 --> 00:46:19.797
Tonight, Butch,
he gets the best in the house.


597
00:46:19.955 --> 00:46:21.502
OK, Tony, you the boss.

598
00:46:21.665 --> 00:46:23.463
Tell me, what's your pleasure?

599
00:46:23.626 --> 00:46:26.300
À la carte? Dinner?

600
00:46:28.464 --> 00:46:29.465
OK.

601
00:46:29.632 --> 00:46:31.225
Hey, Joe.

602
00:46:31.383 --> 00:46:32.430
Butch-a, he says

603
00:46:32.593 --> 00:46:36.223
he wants-a two spaghetti speciale.

604
00:46:36.388 --> 00:46:38.265
Heavy on the meats-a ball.

605
00:46:38.432 --> 00:46:40.309
Tony, dogs don't talk.

606
00:46:40.476 --> 00:46:43.821
- He's a-talkin' to me!
- OK, he's a-talkin' to you.


607
00:46:43.979 --> 00:46:45.151
You the boss.

608
00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.657
Now here you are.

609
00:46:50.819 --> 00:46:53.538
The best spaghetti in town.

Is something wrong, Pige?

645
00:50:05.264 --> 00:50:08.313
- It's morning.
- Yeah.


646

So it is.

647
00:50:11.103 --> 00:50:13.026
I should have been home hours ago.

648
00:50:13.188 --> 00:50:15.282
Why? Because
you still believe in that

"ever faithful old dog Tray"
routine?

653
00:50:27.411 --> 00:50:29.539
I'll show you what I mean.

654
00:50:32.249 --> 00:50:35.093
Look down there.
Tell me what you see.


655
00:50:38.046 --> 00:50:40.890
Well, I see nice homes

656
00:50:41.049 --> 00:50:42.801
with yards and fences.

657
00:50:42.968 --> 00:50:46.142
Exactly. Life on a leash.

658
00:50:46.305 --> 00:50:47.898
Look again, Pige.

659
00:50:50.392 --> 00:50:52.645
Look, there's a great
big hunk of world down there


660
00:50:52.811 --> 00:50:55.030
with no fence around it.

661
00:50:55.189 --> 00:50:58.534
Where two dogs can find
adventure and excitement.


662
00:50:58.692 --> 00:51:00.319
And beyond those distant hills,

663
00:51:00.486 --> 00:51:04.332
who knows what wonderful experiences?

664
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:06.959
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.

665
00:51:07.701 --> 00:51:09.374
It's all ours.

666
00:51:11.413 --> 00:51:12.881
It sounds wonderful.

667
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.838
But?

668
00:51:16.502 --> 00:51:18.175
But who'd watch over the baby?

669
00:51:24.218 --> 00:51:25.845
You win.

670
00:51:26.011 --> 00:51:27.228
Come on.

671
00:51:27.387 --> 00:51:29.310
I'll take you home.

672
00:51:45.197 --> 00:51:47.291
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

673
00:51:47.741 --> 00:51:49.994
<i>And they call it...</i>

674
00:51:53.664 --> 00:51:56.588
Not to change the subject, but...

675
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:57.922
Ever chase chickens?

676
00:51:58.085 --> 00:51:59.712
I should say not!

677
00:52:00.754 --> 00:52:02.222
Then you've never lived.

678
00:52:02.381 --> 00:52:04.383
- But we shouldn't.
- I know.


679
00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:06.393
That's what makes it fun.

680
00:52:07.511 --> 00:52:09.639
Come on, kid.

681
00:52:09.805 --> 00:52:11.773
Start building some memories.

682
00:52:13.809 --> 00:52:15.811
But we...
We won't hurt the chickens?


683
00:52:15.978 --> 00:52:17.480
Hurt 'em? No!

684
00:52:17.646 --> 00:52:19.819
We'll just stir 'em up a bit.

685
00:52:27.197 --> 00:52:29.871
Just look at those fat, lazy biddies.

686
00:52:30.033 --> 00:52:32.161
Why, they should've been up hours ago.

687
00:52:43.964 --> 00:52:46.092
Some fun, hey, kid?

688
00:52:46.258 --> 00:52:48.602
Hey, what's going on in there?

689
00:52:49.136 --> 00:52:50.137
What's that?

690
00:52:50.304 --> 00:52:52.477
That's the signal to get going. Come on.

691
00:52:58.353 --> 00:53:01.482
- This is living, hey, kid!
- Is it?


692
00:53:01.982 --> 00:53:04.405
Come on, Pige. Follow me.

693
00:53:14.828 --> 00:53:18.924
You know, there's a little bit
of bird dog in all of us, Pige.


694
00:53:19.082 --> 00:53:20.174
Pige? Pige?

695
00:53:22.127 --> 00:53:24.004
Pige? Where are you, Pige?

696
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:26.473
Pige?

697
00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:29.472
Pigeon?

698
00:53:31.762 --> 00:53:33.856
Oh, Pige!

699
00:55:16.491 --> 00:55:18.789
Hey. Hey, Dachsie, how we coming?

700
00:55:18.952 --> 00:55:21.046
Just one more chorus and we're out.

701
00:55:21.204 --> 00:55:23.377
OK. On a downbeat.

702
00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:26.544
One, <i>two...</i>

703
00:55:33.467 --> 00:55:35.469
Put her in number four, Bill,

704
00:55:35.635 --> 00:55:39.139
- while I check her license number.
- OK.


705
00:55:40.223 --> 00:55:42.225
All right, baby, in here.

706
00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:48.240
Well, look yous guys,
Miss Park Avenue herself.


707
00:55:48.398 --> 00:55:49.695
Blimey.

708
00:55:49.858 --> 00:55:52.361
A regular bloomin' debutante.

709
00:55:52.527 --> 00:55:54.996
Yeah. And pipe the crown jewel
she's wearin'.


710
00:55:55.155 --> 00:55:57.328
Hey, whatcha in for, sweetheart?

711
00:55:57.491 --> 00:55:59.835
Putting fleas on the butler?

712
00:56:06.124 --> 00:56:09.344
All right, you guys.
Lay off, will you?


713
00:56:09.503 --> 00:56:11.471
What's the matter, Peg?

714
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:15.134
We was only havin'
a bit of sport, we was.


715
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.053
Can't you see the poor kid's
scared enough already?


716
00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:21.520
<i>Pay no attention,
my little ochi chernye.</i>


717
00:56:21.681 --> 00:56:23.058
That's right, dearie.

718
00:56:23.225 --> 00:56:25.068
They don't mean no real harm.

719
00:56:25.227 --> 00:56:28.652
It's like Gorky says
in <i>Lower Depths,</i> quote:


720
00:56:28.814 --> 00:56:32.535
"Miserable being must find
more miserable being.


721
00:56:32.692 --> 00:56:34.740
Then he's happy-"

722
00:56:34.903 --> 00:56:37.873
- Unquote.
- Boris is a philosopher.


723
00:56:38.031 --> 00:56:39.704
Besides, little <i>bublichki,</i>

724
00:56:39.866 --> 00:56:41.459
wearing license here,

725
00:56:41.618 --> 00:56:44.918
that is like waving,
you should excuse the expression,


726
00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:47.174
red flag in front of bull.

727
00:56:47.332 --> 00:56:50.461
My license?
But what's wrong with it?


728
00:56:50.627 --> 00:56:52.721
There ain't nothin' wrong with it.

729
00:56:52.879 --> 00:56:55.052
Confidential,
there's not one dog here


730
00:56:55.215 --> 00:56:58.560
who would not give left hind leg
for such a knick-knack.


731
00:56:58.718 --> 00:57:01.938
That's your passport to freedom, honey
Without it...


732
00:57:02.097 --> 00:57:05.567
Hey
- Hey, yous guys, look.

733
00:57:05.725 --> 00:57:08.353
Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk.

734
00:57:11.565 --> 00:57:13.033
Where is he taking him?

735
00:57:13.191 --> 00:57:16.240
Through the one-way door, sister.

736
00:57:22.409 --> 00:57:25.379
You... You mean he's...

737
00:57:30.167 --> 00:57:32.215
Oh, well.

738
00:57:32.377 --> 00:57:34.254
A short life and a merry one.

739
00:57:34.421 --> 00:57:36.890
Yeah, that's what
the Tramp always says.


740
00:57:37.048 --> 00:57:38.925
- The Tramp?
- Now there's a bloke


741
00:57:39.092 --> 00:57:40.435
what never gets caught.

742
00:57:40.594 --> 00:57:43.438
He's given the slip to every
dogcatcher in this burg.


743
00:57:43.597 --> 00:57:47.602
You won't believe this, dearie,
but no matter how tight a jam he's in,


744
00:57:47.767 --> 00:57:50.441
that Tramp always finds some way out.

745
00:57:50.604 --> 00:57:52.732
I can quite easily believe that.

746
00:57:52.898 --> 00:57:54.946
But remember, my friends,

747
00:57:55.108 --> 00:57:57.657
even Tramp has his Achilles' heel.

748
00:57:57.819 --> 00:58:00.993
Pardon me, amigo.
What is this "chili heel"?


749
00:58:01.156 --> 00:58:03.375
Achilles' heel, Pedro.

750
00:58:03.533 --> 00:58:06.457
This is meaning his... weaknesses.

751
00:58:07.412 --> 00:58:09.335
The dames. Yeah.

752
00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:13.794
He has an eye
for a well-turned paw, he has.


753
00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:15.837
Let's see. There's been Lulu.

754
00:58:16.004 --> 00:58:17.221
Yeah, and Trixie.

755
00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.848
Und Fifi.

756
00:58:19.007 --> 00:58:20.259
And my sister,

757
00:58:20.425 --> 00:58:22.803
Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua.

758
00:58:22.969 --> 00:58:24.061
I think.

759
00:58:24.387 --> 00:58:25.809
What a dog.

760
00:58:25.972 --> 00:58:28.441
Yeah. Tell us about it, Peg.

761
00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:31.103
What a dog!

762
00:58:31.269 --> 00:58:34.113
Peg used to be
in the Dog and Pony Follies.


763
00:58:34.272 --> 00:58:36.570
<i>He's a tramp</i>

764
00:58:36.733 --> 00:58:38.861
<i>But they love him</i>

765
00:58:39.027 --> 00:58:42.748
<i>Breaks</i> a <i>new heart every day</i>

766
00:58:43.531 --> 00:58:45.704
<i>He's a tramp</i>

767
00:58:45.867 --> 00:58:47.790
<i>They adore him</i>

768
00:58:47.953 --> 00:58:52.083
<i>And I only hope he'll stay that way</i>

769
00:58:52.707 --> 00:58:54.926
<i>He's a tramp</i>

770
00:58:55.085 --> 00:58:57.087
<i>He's a scoundrel</i>

771
00:58:57.254 --> 00:58:59.302
<i>He's a rounder</i>

772
00:58:59.464 --> 00:59:01.637
<i>He's a cad</i>

773
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.848
<i>He's a tramp</i>

774
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:06.183
<i>But I love him</i>

775
00:59:06.346 --> 00:59:09.896
<i>Yes, even I have got it pretty bad</i>

776
00:59:11.142 --> 00:59:13.486
<i>You can never tell</i>

777
00:59:13.645 --> 00:59:15.613
<i>When he'll show up</i>

778
00:59:16.606 --> 00:59:19.200
<i>He gives you plenty of trouble</i>

779
00:59:20.819 --> 00:59:24.790
<i>I guess he's just a no 'count pup</i>

780
00:59:24.948 --> 00:59:28.452
<i>But I wish that he were double</i>

781
00:59:28.618 --> 00:59:30.586
<i>He's a tramp</i>

782
00:59:30.745 --> 00:59:33.214
<i>He's a rover</i>

783
00:59:33.373 --> 00:59:36.252
<i>And there's nothin' more to say</i>

784
00:59:37.377 --> 00:59:39.471
<i>If he's a tramp</i>

785
00:59:39.629 --> 00:59:41.381
<i>He's a good one</i>

786
00:59:41.548 --> 00:59:46.930
<i>And I wish that
I could travel his way</i>

787
00:59:47.095 --> 00:59:56.948
<i>Wish that I could travel his way</i>

788
00:59:58.648 --> 00:59:59.649
Yeah.

789
00:59:59.816 --> 01:00:01.489
But he never takes them serious.

790
01:00:02.152 --> 01:00:07.033
But someday he is meeting
someone different.


791
01:00:07.198 --> 01:00:09.872
Some delicate, fragile creature

792
01:00:10.035 --> 01:00:13.414
who's giving him a wish
to shelter and protect.


793
01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.005
Like Miss Park Avenue here, matey?

794
01:00:17.167 --> 01:00:19.135
Could be.

795
01:00:19.294 --> 01:00:22.594
- But when he does...
- Yeah. I'm way ahead of ya.


796
01:00:22.756 --> 01:00:25.259
Under the spell of true love...

797
01:00:25.425 --> 01:00:27.894
The poor chump grows careless...

798
01:00:28.053 --> 01:00:29.930
The Cossacks are picking him <i>up...</i>

799
01:00:30.096 --> 01:00:32.645
And it's curtains for the Tramp.

800
01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:36.983
It's the little cooker, Bill.

801
01:00:37.145 --> 01:00:39.819
- In number four.
- OK.


802
01:00:41.316 --> 01:00:42.693
All right, baby.

803
01:00:42.859 --> 01:00:45.453
They've come to take you home.

804
01:00:45.612 --> 01:00:48.616
You're too nice a girl
to be in this place.


805
01:00:59.167 --> 01:01:00.419
Courage, man.

806
01:01:00.585 --> 01:01:01.802
Courage!

807
01:01:01.961 --> 01:01:03.087
<i>But...</i>

808
01:01:03.254 --> 01:01:06.258
I've never even considered matrimony.

809
01:01:06.424 --> 01:01:08.301
Nor I.

810
01:01:08.468 --> 01:01:10.937
But no matter which of us she accepts,

811
01:01:11.096 --> 01:01:13.815
we'll always be the best of friends.

812
01:01:15.141 --> 01:01:16.313
Now remember,

813
01:01:16.476 --> 01:01:19.446
not a word about her
unfortunate experience.


814
01:01:19.604 --> 01:01:23.199
- We don't want to hurt her feelings
- Yeah. Yeah.


815
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:25.823
Lassie.

816
01:01:25.985 --> 01:01:29.080
Miss Lady, ma'am.

817
01:01:29.239 --> 01:01:32.288
Please, I don't want to see anybody.

818
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:34.919
Now, now, lassie.

819
01:01:35.078 --> 01:01:36.580
Don't feel that way about it.

820
01:01:36.746 --> 01:01:39.340
Of course not, Miss Lady.

821
01:01:39.499 --> 01:01:42.924
Why, some of the finest people
I ever tracked down


822
01:01:43.086 --> 01:01:44.633
- were jailbirds.
- Quiet!


823
01:01:44.796 --> 01:01:46.514
You great loony!

824
01:01:47.465 --> 01:01:49.684
Please, lassie.

825
01:01:49.843 --> 01:01:53.313
We've come with a proposition
for helpin' ya.


826
01:01:53.471 --> 01:01:55.815
Help me? What do you mean?

827
01:01:55.974 --> 01:01:57.897
Well, now...

828
01:01:58.059 --> 01:01:59.936
You see, lassie...

829
01:02:00.103 --> 01:02:02.447
Neither of us is as young
as we used to be.


830
01:02:02.605 --> 01:02:05.449
But we're still in the prime of life.

831
01:02:05.608 --> 01:02:06.609
Aye.

832
01:02:06.776 --> 01:02:10.280
And we've both got
very comfortable homes


833
01:02:10.447 --> 01:02:13.121
That's right. Where we know

834
01:02:13.283 --> 01:02:16.457
you'll be welcome
and appreciated, Miss Lady.


835
01:02:16.619 --> 01:02:21.216
<i>So...</i> So, to come
directly to the point...


836
01:02:21.374 --> 01:02:23.217
If you could...

837
01:02:23.376 --> 01:02:27.097
...find it possible to...

838
01:02:27.255 --> 01:02:28.381
<i>To...</i>

839
01:02:28.548 --> 01:02:31.973
You're both very kind,
and I do appreciate it.


840
01:02:32.135 --> 01:02:34.058
- But...
- Oh, Pigeon.


841
01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:36.097
<i>Oh, Pi...</i>

842
01:02:36.264 --> 01:02:38.187
Oh! Hi, boys.

843
01:02:41.853 --> 01:02:43.947
Anything new in the kennel club set?

844
01:02:48.359 --> 01:02:50.953
A little something
I picked up for you, Pige.


845
01:03:00.497 --> 01:03:02.591
Looks like I'm the one
that's in the doghouse.


846
01:03:02.749 --> 01:03:07.220
If this person is
annoying you, Miss Lady...


847
01:03:07.378 --> 01:03:10.222
We'll gladly throw the rascal out.

848
01:03:10.381 --> 01:03:12.884
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

849
01:03:13.051 --> 01:03:15.224
Very well, ma'am.

850
01:03:15.386 --> 01:03:18.185
<i>You... You...</i>

851
01:03:18.348 --> 01:03:20.442
...mongrel!

852
01:03:25.146 --> 01:03:27.740
Come on, Pige.

853
01:03:27.899 --> 01:03:30.197
It wasn't my fault.

854
01:03:31.569 --> 01:03:35.039
I thought you were
right behind me. Honest.


855
01:03:35.198 --> 01:03:37.451
When I heard they'd
taken you to the pound...


856
01:03:37.617 --> 01:03:39.915
Don't even mention that horrible place.

857
01:03:40.078 --> 01:03:43.082
I was so embarrassed and...

858
01:03:43.248 --> 01:03:46.297
- And frightened.
- Now, now.


859
01:03:46.459 --> 01:03:50.259
Who could ever harm
a cute little trick like you?


860
01:03:50.421 --> 01:03:52.469
Trick? Trick!

861
01:03:52.632 --> 01:03:56.432
- That reminds me, who is Trixie?
- Trixie?


862
01:03:56.594 --> 01:03:59.222
And Lulu and Fifi
and Rosita Chiquita wh...


863
01:03:59.389 --> 01:04:01.437
- Whatever her name is.
- Chiquita...


864
01:04:01.599 --> 01:04:03.522
Oh! Yes! Well, I
-I...

865
01:04:03.685 --> 01:04:07.030
As far as I'm concerned,
you needn't worry about your old heel.


866
01:04:07.188 --> 01:04:08.189
MY heel?

867
01:04:08.356 --> 01:04:10.450
I don't need you
to shelter and protect me.


868
01:04:10.608 --> 01:04:13.077
- But...
- If you grow careless, don't blame me.


869
01:04:13.236 --> 01:04:16.911
I don't care if the Cossacks
do pick you up! Goodbye.


870
01:04:17.782 --> 01:04:19.455
And take this with you.

871
01:05:26.726 --> 01:05:28.728
Stop that.

872
01:05:31.939 --> 01:05:33.657
Hush, now, hush.

873
01:05:37.945 --> 01:05:39.618
Stop that racket!

874
01:05:42.241 --> 01:05:43.367
What's wrong, Pige?

875
01:05:43.534 --> 01:05:45.207
- A rat!
- Where?


876
01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:47.543
Upstairs, in the baby's room!

877
01:05:47.705 --> 01:05:50.379
- How do I get in?
- The little door.


878
01:05:50.541 --> 01:05:51.838
On the porch.

879
01:07:38.149 --> 01:07:39.571
Merciful heavens!

880
01:07:39.734 --> 01:07:43.329
Oh, you poor little darling.

881
01:07:43.488 --> 01:07:46.412
No, no, no.
Thank goodness you're not hurt.


882
01:07:46.574 --> 01:07:49.453
You... You vicious brutes. Back!

883
01:07:49.619 --> 01:07:51.166
Get back!

884
01:07:51.329 --> 01:07:53.548
Go on! Get back!

885
01:07:53.706 --> 01:07:57.586
The pound. The pound, that's it.
I'll call the pound.


886
01:07:59.879 --> 01:08:02.302
Come here, you. Come here!

887
01:08:03.382 --> 01:08:04.725
Come on, come on.

888
01:08:04.884 --> 01:08:06.932
Come along. I'll call them this minute.

889
01:08:07.094 --> 01:08:09.643
I won't sleep a wink
with that brute in the house.


890
01:08:17.522 --> 01:08:20.196
Hello? Hello!

891
01:08:24.362 --> 01:08:27.411
I don't care if you
are alone there, young man.


892
01:08:27.573 --> 01:08:30.622
I insist you pick him up immediately.

893
01:08:38.501 --> 01:08:40.629
Darling, look.

894
01:08:42.255 --> 01:08:45.850
If you want my advice
you'll destroy that animal at once.


895
01:08:46.008 --> 01:08:47.555
Don't worry, ma'am.

896
01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:50.229
We've been after this one for months.

897
01:08:50.388 --> 01:08:52.186
We'll take care of him.

898
01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.108
- What do you suppose...?
- Say, what's going on here?


899
01:08:58.271 --> 01:09:00.069
Just picking up a stray, mister.

900
01:09:00.231 --> 01:09:02.484
Come on, giddap.

901
01:09:02.650 --> 01:09:03.993
Caught him attacking a baby.

902
01:09:04.151 --> 01:09:05.448
- Good heavens.
- My baby.


903
01:09:05.611 --> 01:09:07.864
Aunt Sarah!

904
01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:10.912
Aunt Sarah!

905
01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:14.833
I was certain he was no good

906
01:09:14.996 --> 01:09:17.249
the moment I first laid eyes on him.

907
01:09:17.415 --> 01:09:19.964
Yeah, <i>but...</i>

908
01:09:20.126 --> 01:09:23.380
I never thought
he'd do a thing like that.


909
01:09:24.797 --> 01:09:26.970
Thank goodness I got there in time.
There they were...


910
01:09:27.133 --> 01:09:30.262
No, I'm sure there must be
some mistake. Lady wouldn't...


911
01:09:32.513 --> 01:09:35.266
Watch out! That dog's loose.
Keep her away.


912
01:09:35.433 --> 01:09:37.902
Nonsense.
She's trying to tell us something.


913
01:09:39.061 --> 01:09:40.358
What is it, old girl?

914
01:09:42.148 --> 01:09:43.320
What are you try...

915
01:09:43.482 --> 01:09:45.155
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.

916
01:09:45.318 --> 01:09:46.865
What is it, Jim?

917
01:09:47.486 --> 01:09:48.487
A rat!

918
01:09:48.654 --> 01:09:50.327
A rat?

919
01:09:50.489 --> 01:09:52.241
We should've known.

920
01:09:52.408 --> 01:09:55.457
I misjudged him.

921
01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:56.621
Badly.

922
01:09:56.787 --> 01:10:00.257
Come on. We got to stop that wagon.

923
01:10:00.416 --> 01:10:03.761
But, man, we don't know
which way they've gone.


924
01:10:04.253 --> 01:10:06.130
We'll track 'em down.

925
01:10:06.297 --> 01:10:07.469
And then?

926
01:10:07.632 --> 01:10:09.225
We'll hold 'em.

927
01:10:09.383 --> 01:10:11.260
Hold 'em at bay.

928
01:10:23.606 --> 01:10:24.698
Now what?

929
01:10:24.857 --> 01:10:28.031
The scent. Follow the scent.

930
01:10:34.909 --> 01:10:37.082
Let's face it, man.

931
01:10:37.244 --> 01:10:39.963
We both know you've lost
your sense of smell.


932
01:11:46.397 --> 01:11:47.865
Go on, get out of here.

933
01:11:48.607 --> 01:11:49.699
Go on, get away.

934
01:11:55.406 --> 01:11:57.124
Easy. Go on, get away.

935
01:11:57.283 --> 01:11:58.910
Watch it now. Watch it!

936
01:12:13.674 --> 01:12:15.096
Hi, Pige.

937
01:12:45.998 --> 01:12:48.922
All right, everybody, watch the birdy.

938
01:13:00.137 --> 01:13:01.263
Steady, now.

939
01:13:03.015 --> 01:13:04.358
Hold it.

940
01:13:07.937 --> 01:13:09.939
I guess I used a little too much.

941
01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:15.403
Darling, visitors.

942
01:13:15.569 --> 01:13:16.661
Visitors?

943
01:13:17.613 --> 01:13:19.615
Why, it's Jock.

944
01:13:21.242 --> 01:13:23.210
And good old Trusty.

945
01:13:23.994 --> 01:13:25.416
Careful now, man.

946
01:13:25.579 --> 01:13:28.458
Careful. It's a wee bit slippery.

947
01:13:28.749 --> 01:13:30.296
Yes, yes.

948
01:13:32.378 --> 01:13:34.676
All right, boy. 
We'll let 'em in.

949
01:13:35.965 --> 01:13:37.967
No, no, not you, young man.

950
01:13:38.134 --> 01:13:39.431
You're going to take a nap.

951
01:13:39.969 --> 01:13:41.937
Well, Merry Christmas.

952
01:13:42.096 --> 01:13:44.440
Come in. If you'll just
step into the parlor,


953
01:13:44.598 --> 01:13:46.396
I'll see about refreshments.

954
01:13:46.559 --> 01:13:50.029
Darling, where did you
put the dog biscuits?


955
01:13:50.187 --> 01:13:52.565
The box Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.

956
01:13:52.731 --> 01:13:54.199
In the kitchen, Jim, dear.

957
01:13:55.025 --> 01:13:56.948
No doubt about it.

958
01:13:57.111 --> 01:13:59.580
They've got their mother's eyes.

959
01:14:01.448 --> 01:14:02.745
Aye.

960
01:14:05.661 --> 01:14:08.130
But there's a bit of
their father in them too.


961
01:14:10.166 --> 01:14:14.091
Well, and I see you finally
acquired a collar.


962
01:14:14.253 --> 01:14:17.302
Oh. Yes.

963
01:14:17.464 --> 01:14:18.761
Complete with license.

964
01:14:18.924 --> 01:14:22.019
Oh, yeah, a new collar.

965
01:14:22.178 --> 01:14:25.057
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.


966
01:14:25.890 --> 01:14:27.267
Trusty, I says,

967
01:14:27.433 --> 01:14:31.438
Trusty, somebody's
wearing a new collar.


968
01:14:32.438 --> 01:14:35.863
'Course, my sense of smell

969
01:14:36.025 --> 01:14:38.403
is very highly developed.

970
01:14:38.569 --> 01:14:40.196
Runs in the family, you know.

971
01:14:40.362 --> 01:14:42.785
There'll be no livin'
with him from now on.


972
01:14:42.948 --> 01:14:47.545
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...


973
01:14:47.703 --> 01:14:51.753
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.


974
01:14:51.916 --> 01:14:54.044
No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.

975
01:14:55.753 --> 01:14:57.881

976
01:14:58.047 --> 01:15:00.015
<i>Well...</i>

977
01:15:00.174 --> 01:15:03.599

<i>Of good will</i>

985
01:15:36.418 --> 01:15:39.718

<i>Peace</i>

987
01:15:42.049 --> 01:15:44.928
