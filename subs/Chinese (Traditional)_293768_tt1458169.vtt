00:04:50.025 --> 00:04:51.929
Hey, sorry. I'm here alone.

18
00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:53.726
- Would you like coffee?
- That'd be great.


19
00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:56.280
- I'd like a hot tea.
- Okay.


20
00:04:57.268 --> 00:04:59.132
This is so really bad.

21
00:04:59.351 --> 00:05:00.353
It's fine.

22
00:05:00.406 --> 00:05:03.210
This is the grossest place
I've ever seen in my life.


23
00:05:03.377 --> 00:05:04.710
- It's fine.
- It's dirty.


24
00:05:04.765 --> 00:05:06.093
It's local.

25
00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:10.140
Mom,
you said we need to leave at 11.


26
00:05:10.263 --> 00:05:12.822
I know, honey.
But Agnes isn't here yet.


27
00:05:13.007 --> 00:05:16.369
We have to wait for her, sweetie.
I promise, we're gonna leave soon.


28
00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:23.603
What is that like the
third time this week?


29
00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:25.533
Next time
it's going out of your paycheck.


30
00:05:25.635 --> 00:05:27.517
Dale, where's my eggs over?

31
00:05:27.603 --> 00:05:31.055
- Right here. You said up.
- I said easy.


32
00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:34.038
- Give me 5 minutes.
- Well, I don't have 5 minutes.


33
00:05:34.147 --> 00:05:35.827
- I got to get out of here.
- Jeez.


34
00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:39.061
Okay, darling.

35
00:05:39.125 --> 00:05:40.850
How about you colored it up
for your mother.


36
00:05:40.898 --> 00:05:41.898
Okay. Ow!

37
00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:43.971
I'll get it later.

38
00:05:48.824 --> 00:05:51.175
- Crawfish Friday?
- Crawfish are good.


39
00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:55.129
Just peel the tail back
and suck all the juice out the head.


40
00:05:55.402 --> 00:05:57.847
- You suck juice out of the head?
- Yeah.


41
00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.113
- What?
- Yeah, you just...


42
00:06:03.404 --> 00:06:07.816
Okay.
Here's a Belgian waffle and bacon.


43
00:06:09.574 --> 00:06:11.004
Where the hash browns?

44
00:06:11.152 --> 00:06:13.435
- You ordered bacon.
- I want it hash browns.


45
00:06:13.524 --> 00:06:16.113
- Okay, I can get you that. No problem.
- No, he's fine.


46
00:06:16.255 --> 00:06:18.793
- You ordered bacon.
- I want it hash browns.


47
00:06:18.954 --> 00:06:20.104
Come on.

48
00:06:20.393 --> 00:06:23.042
Tyler, eat. He's fine.

49
00:06:23.136 --> 00:06:25.425
- Okay. Short stack with eggs.
- That's grandma's.


50
00:06:25.712 --> 00:06:27.532
Mom, breakfast!

51
00:06:27.732 --> 00:06:30.932
I can't eat now.
I just took my pills.


52
00:06:31.222 --> 00:06:32.722
You know what, you can have
grandma's potatoes.


53
00:06:32.793 --> 00:06:34.066
I don't want hers.

54
00:06:34.168 --> 00:06:35.988
Tyler,
knock it off.


55
00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.152
Okay,
egg white omelet for you.


56
00:06:38.293 --> 00:06:40.165
- Honey.
- Yes, ma'am?


57
00:06:40.527 --> 00:06:42.524
You remind me of my daughter.

58
00:06:42.613 --> 00:06:46.808
- Doesn't she look like Stephanie?
- Mom, I'm your daughter. Stephanie.


59
00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:48.371
I'm your daughter.

60
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:53.441
- Tabasco?
- Okay, I'll get your Tabasco.


61
00:06:54.544 --> 00:06:56.340
And your eggs will be right up, sir.

62
00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.215
- Where's Agnes, Bill?
- Late?


63
00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:02.965
- You trying to be funny?
- No, she's not answering her phone.


64
00:07:03.082 --> 00:07:05.457
She might have overslept.
Can you do a double?


65
00:07:05.605 --> 00:07:08.183
Can't, I got plans with my kid.
Call Alan.


66
00:07:14.453 --> 00:07:16.583
Okay, hot coffee.

67
00:07:17.754 --> 00:07:20.660
No, no, no. I would like
herbal tea, please.


68
00:07:23.105 --> 00:07:25.496
Okay, I'll get you an herbal tea.

69
00:07:25.613 --> 00:07:28.449
- Did you guys get menus?
- No, but we'd like some.


70
00:07:28.761 --> 00:07:31.300
- Claire.
- What? Like we're supposed to guess?


71
00:07:31.465 --> 00:07:33.816
- I'll be right back.
- Do your job.


72
00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:37.636
Okay, I'm so sorry about that.
Here you go.


73
00:07:38.111 --> 00:07:39.590
Silverware.

74
00:07:40.566 --> 00:07:42.902
- Is everybody good here now?
- He's sulking.


75
00:07:43.067 --> 00:07:44.580
I am not.

76
00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.394
You know what, can you just
bring us side hash browns?


77
00:07:47.465 --> 00:07:49.965
- Burnt on the edges.
- Burnt on the edges, coming up.


78
00:07:50.075 --> 00:07:51.224
- We're good.
- Okay.


79
00:07:51.308 --> 00:07:52.915
Still waiting on my eggs.

80
00:07:52.965 --> 00:07:55.535
Oh! Right.
Your eggs are coming right up.


81
00:07:55.625 --> 00:07:57.144
Yeah,
and can I actually get...


82
00:07:57.192 --> 00:07:59.636
Can I switch to wheat toast
instead of white toast, is that alright?


83
00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:01.517
Yeah, wheat instead of white.
Yep, got it.


84
00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:03.050
- Thank you.
- Be right back.


85
00:08:03.185 --> 00:08:05.697
New side of hash browns,
burnt on the edges.


86
00:08:05.862 --> 00:08:07.237
Copy.

87
00:08:08.161 --> 00:08:09.511
Miss!

88
00:08:12.254 --> 00:08:13.284
Don't yell.

89
00:08:13.563 --> 00:08:14.493
Miss!

90
00:08:14.574 --> 00:08:16.435
- Please stop yelling.
- Shut up.


91
00:08:18.218 --> 00:08:19.299
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

92
00:08:19.347 --> 00:08:22.418
But Karla's kid sitting here waiting
for her to take him to the park.


93
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:25.445
Yeah, so you can come in?

94
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.300
So come in.

95
00:08:28.827 --> 00:08:30.217
Here you go.

96
00:08:30.535 --> 00:08:36.254
All the herbal tea you could
possibly want and two menus.


97
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:40.558
Is your oatmeal steel?

98
00:08:40.754 --> 00:08:42.699
- What?
- Cut.


99
00:08:42.863 --> 00:08:46.582
- Are your oats steel-cut?
- No, they're Quaker.


100
00:08:50.582 --> 00:08:52.714
- Should I come back...
- No, no.


101
00:08:52.793 --> 00:08:54.660
Oatmeal with...

102
00:08:54.898 --> 00:08:57.035
I'll take with
with reduced fat almond.


103
00:08:58.715 --> 00:09:00.707
Oh, let me guess,
you only have wholemeal?


104
00:09:00.832 --> 00:09:02.644
- From the Outer?
- No, from AMP.


105
00:09:02.723 --> 00:09:05.675
Why don't I just apply it
directly to my thighs?


106
00:09:06.556 --> 00:09:08.215
You could use some help.

107
00:09:11.332 --> 00:09:12.845
Karla, go ahead and go.

108
00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:15.386
- Really?
- Yeah. Dale found Agnes.


109
00:09:15.652 --> 00:09:18.294
- She should be here in 15 minutes.
- Awesome.


110
00:09:18.347 --> 00:09:21.582
- Who wants to go to the park?
- I am!


111
00:09:23.282 --> 00:09:24.682
Let's go.

112
00:10:54.508 --> 00:10:56.704
Mommy, your turn.

113
00:11:00.646 --> 00:11:02.922
Is daddy coming to the fair?

114
00:11:03.485 --> 00:11:06.305
No, sweetheart.
You're gonna see daddy next weekend.


115
00:11:06.485 --> 00:11:09.035
And maybe
you'll get to see Cheryl too.


116
00:11:11.656 --> 00:11:13.256
Do you like Cheryl?

117
00:11:15.836 --> 00:11:19.000
- I don't know.
- I think she's nice, Frankie.


118
00:11:19.844 --> 00:11:22.961
And she's smart.
She's very smart.


119
00:11:23.226 --> 00:11:26.875
- She's gonna be a doctor.
- Yeah, I know.


120
00:11:28.032 --> 00:11:30.446
And I want you to really
make friends with her, okay?


121
00:11:30.522 --> 00:11:32.110
Are you friends with her?

122
00:11:32.925 --> 00:11:34.055
Yeah.

123
00:11:34.414 --> 00:11:35.500
Yeah, I am.

124
00:11:35.555 --> 00:11:39.321
She, daddy and I,
we all love somebody like crazy.


125
00:11:39.525 --> 00:11:42.688
- Do you know who that is?
- Me!


126
00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:44.595
You!

127
00:11:47.846 --> 00:11:49.106
You.

128
00:11:50.579 --> 00:11:52.375
We all love you.

129
00:12:22.435 --> 00:12:24.122
Mommy, can I get ice cream?

130
00:12:24.193 --> 00:12:27.216
You know what, how about
we check out all of our options first...


131
00:12:27.294 --> 00:12:28.755
and then maybe
we'll come back.


132
00:12:28.911 --> 00:12:30.685
- Okay? Come on.
- Okay.


133
00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.357
Can I get my face painted?

134
00:12:48.405 --> 00:12:50.499
How about we wait until
the line is a little shorter?


135
00:12:50.555 --> 00:12:52.094
We'll come back, okay?

136
00:13:04.498 --> 00:13:07.918
- Marco.
- Polo.


137
00:13:08.803 --> 00:13:11.795
- How old your boy?
- Six.


138
00:13:12.505 --> 00:13:14.780
He obviously likes to hide.

139
00:13:24.688 --> 00:13:26.256
Marco.

140
00:13:27.125 --> 00:13:29.485
Oh, Marco.

141
00:13:30.139 --> 00:13:31.735
Oh, no.

142
00:13:32.397 --> 00:13:35.665
Am I lost my little Frankie
forever?


143
00:13:36.624 --> 00:13:38.921
Where could he be?

144
00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:41.030
There you are.

145
00:13:42.844 --> 00:13:44.522
Come on,
let's go see the show.


146
00:14:04.186 --> 00:14:06.056
Can I get my face painted now?

147
00:14:06.662 --> 00:14:09.592
Yeah, as soon as this song is over,
okay sweetheart?


148
00:14:12.228 --> 00:14:14.353
Frankie, I'm gonna need
my phone for one second.


149
00:14:14.416 --> 00:14:16.072
There you go.
Let's switch.


150
00:14:16.232 --> 00:14:17.416
Hello?

151
00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:20.174
Yeah.

152
00:14:20.806 --> 00:14:22.865
Can you hold on just one second?

153
00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:24.564
Okay. Frankie, listen.

154
00:14:24.652 --> 00:14:27.345
I'm gonna have to go over there
and take this phone call, okay?


155
00:14:27.478 --> 00:14:30.158
It's really important.
Don't move, okay?


156
00:14:30.352 --> 00:14:32.853
- Marco.
- Polo.


157
00:14:33.855 --> 00:14:35.369
Don't move.

158
00:14:36.077 --> 00:14:38.267
Okay, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

159
00:14:41.468 --> 00:14:42.918
He wants what?

160
00:14:44.885 --> 00:14:46.845
Primary custody?

161
00:14:48.895 --> 00:14:51.694
Well, he can't have that.
I mean, can he?


162
00:14:54.275 --> 00:14:57.985
My batteries are gonna die, Mr. Jackson.
If it does, I'll call you back, okay?


163
00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:00.905

I'm sorry. What?

165
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.800
I can't hear you.
Say that again.


166
00:15:08.062 --> 00:15:13.389
Yes, yes, I have a job.
I have a regular job. Yes.


167
00:15:15.061 --> 00:15:17.498
Is that even gonna matter
to the court?


168
00:15:18.765 --> 00:15:20.957
Well, yeah, he's in real estate.

169
00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:25.565
And his girlfriend is a pediatrician
and I'm a waitress.


170
00:15:25.701 --> 00:15:27.694
So you do the math. Marco.

172
00:15:31.535 --> 00:15:33.665
Let me tell you something, Mr. Jackson.

173
00:15:34.325 --> 00:15:38.625
If he thinks that he's gonna take
my son away from me just because...

Frankie.

189
00:16:45.145 --> 00:16:48.202

- No, I can't find him.


190
00:16:48.258 --> 00:16:49.537
- I don't know where he is.
- Okay.

Frankie!

197
00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:04.061

Don't let me lose him.

225
00:20:11.902 --> 00:20:17.945
Okay, God, I know I never pray to you
unless somebody is sick.


226
00:20:19.324 --> 00:20:22.355
Or somebody's dying or in an airplane.

227
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.113
But, God, please don't let me lose him.

228
00:20:27.785 --> 00:20:31.025
But if you get me this one thing,
God...

This one thing...

230
00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:38.488
I will never ever ask you
for another thing as long as I live.


231
00:20:41.245 --> 00:20:43.075
Let them be there, God.

232
00:20:44.875 --> 00:20:47.635
Oh, thank God.
Oh, God, thank you.

00:30:52.485 --> 00:30:55.003
<i>I really think that's your mom
in the parking lot.</i>


320
00:30:55.075 --> 00:30:56.824
<i>Come on, let's go find her.</i>

321
00:30:57.025 --> 00:30:59.519
<i>Go, she's scared.
She thinks you're lost.</i>


322
00:30:59.695 --> 00:31:03.245
<i>I don't know, because she said...</i>

323
00:31:28.327 --> 00:31:29.665
Oh, God.

324
00:31:29.944 --> 00:31:32.765
The police. Thank God, the police.

325
00:31:42.257 --> 00:31:43.627
Come on!

326
00:31:44.105 --> 00:31:46.413
Come on, come and get me!

327
00:32:02.476 --> 00:32:03.916
Okay.

328
00:32:04.135 --> 00:32:07.015
Come up here. Come up here.

329
00:32:17.945 --> 00:32:21.144
They got my son! Help me!

330
00:32:21.145 --> 00:32:23.805
- Pull over!
- No! Stop them!


331
00:32:23.955 --> 00:32:26.714
- They have my son in that car!
- Pull your car over now!


332
00:32:26.715 --> 00:32:30.354
Pull them over!
They got my son in that car!


333
00:32:30.355 --> 00:32:32.965
My son! Help me!

334
00:32:34.065 --> 00:32:36.545
Pull that van over now!

335
00:32:37.105 --> 00:32:40.305
This is your last warning! Pull over!

336
00:32:41.275 --> 00:32:45.155
- Pull the car over now!
- Help me! They got my son!


337
00:32:47.885 --> 00:32:49.245
No!

338
00:33:32.755 --> 00:33:33.995
Oh, God!

339
00:34:12.559 --> 00:34:14.019
Frankie!

340
00:34:14.335 --> 00:34:16.055
I'm here, Frankie!

341
00:34:17.485 --> 00:34:19.135
Oh, God.

342
00:34:30.926 --> 00:34:32.746
What do you want?

343
00:34:46.265 --> 00:34:47.655
No!

344
00:35:22.514 --> 00:35:25.114
What do you people want?

345
00:35:26.982 --> 00:35:28.292
Money?

346
00:35:33.299 --> 00:35:37.425
There's not a lot of cash in here.
But all my credit cards are in here too.


347
00:35:37.995 --> 00:35:41.175
So you can get
all the money I have.

348
00:35:41.875 --> 00:35:46.745
My PIN number is 1015.

349
00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.451
Here.

350
00:35:58.565 --> 00:36:02.465
If you let him out of that car,
I will stop chasing you.


351
00:36:02.661 --> 00:36:03.941
I'll go away.

352
00:36:04.675 --> 00:36:08.295
All I want is my son.
That's all I care about.


353
00:36:08.735 --> 00:36:11.915
If the cops asked,
I haven't seen your face.


354
00:36:12.005 --> 00:36:14.145
I don't know your license plate.

355
00:36:14.945 --> 00:36:15.974
You can get away.

356
00:36:16.209 --> 00:36:19.525
If they asked me,
I won't know anything.


357
00:36:30.325 --> 00:36:32.105
Let me tell you something.

358
00:36:33.365 --> 00:36:39.270
As long as my
son is in that car...

359
00:36:39.457 --> 00:36:42.450
I will not stop.

360
00:36:43.021 --> 00:36:44.751
Wherever you go...

361
00:36:45.805 --> 00:36:48.485
I will be right behind you.

362
00:36:50.216 --> 00:36:53.357
No matter what.

363
00:37:36.123 --> 00:37:38.393
- Mommy!
- Frankie.


364
00:37:38.475 --> 00:37:40.025
Frankie.

365
00:38:07.765 --> 00:38:09.795
Karla, unlock the door.

366
00:38:11.308 --> 00:38:12.848
What do you want?

367
00:38:13.155 --> 00:38:14.965
You got $10,000?

368
00:38:16.395 --> 00:38:17.395
Yeah.

369
00:38:18.015 --> 00:38:21.471
I'm gonna ride with you,
your son is gonna ride with him...


370
00:38:21.685 --> 00:38:23.825
and we're gonna go get that money.

371
00:38:25.299 --> 00:38:27.385
Or you're gonna kill me.

372
00:38:28.409 --> 00:38:29.845
That's what he wants.

373
00:38:30.268 --> 00:38:32.175
What he wants me to do.

374
00:38:32.549 --> 00:38:36.745
But I told him for $10,000,
we can make a new plan.


375
00:38:37.958 --> 00:38:43.068
You want your boy and I want $10,000.

376
00:38:48.541 --> 00:38:53.674
Karla, we have to get out of this field.
Unlock the door.


377
00:38:55.371 --> 00:38:56.621
No.

378
00:38:57.666 --> 00:39:00.395
I'm trying to save your child.

379
00:39:01.112 --> 00:39:04.518
Open the door before he changes his mind.

380
00:39:04.893 --> 00:39:08.221
Come on.
You want him to kill your son?


381
00:39:27.825 --> 00:39:29.393
Follow him.

382
00:39:47.455 --> 00:39:48.915
Where do I go?

383
00:39:49.502 --> 00:39:52.471
Just keep going straight,
I'll tell you where to go.


384
00:39:55.995 --> 00:39:58.690
After we get the money,
I'll give him a call...


385
00:39:58.876 --> 00:40:01.116
and you'll get your boy back.

386
00:42:12.685 --> 00:42:14.786
Okay. Okay.

387
00:42:17.475 --> 00:42:18.805
I know.

388
00:42:33.565 --> 00:42:35.995
Go, go, go.

389
00:43:45.025 --> 00:43:46.365
Okay.

390
00:43:47.655 --> 00:43:49.115
So now what's the plan?

391
00:43:52.465 --> 00:43:55.005
You don't really even have a plan,
do you?


392
00:43:55.247 --> 00:43:58.356
You have no idea
what to even do right now.


393
00:43:58.489 --> 00:43:59.613
You need her...

394
00:43:59.683 --> 00:44:02.136
You need her to tell you
what to do, don't you?


395
00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.385
Shit!

396
00:45:48.385 --> 00:45:49.955
No!

397
00:45:50.305 --> 00:45:52.075
No! Stop!

398
00:45:52.255 --> 00:45:53.935
Frankie!

399
00:45:55.935 --> 00:45:57.745
No!

400
00:46:03.885 --> 00:46:06.655
Oh, God! I need help!

401
00:47:03.285 --> 00:47:05.125
Call 911!

402
00:47:05.695 --> 00:47:08.955
- Why?
- My son has been kidnapped!


403
00:47:09.167 --> 00:47:11.565
- What?
- Repeat after me!


404
00:47:12.225 --> 00:47:18.035
80's Green Mustang GT!

405
00:47:18.095 --> 00:47:21.655
- Mustang GT.
- Call the police right now!


406
00:47:22.385 --> 00:47:24.785
Call the police now!

407
00:48:52.395 --> 00:48:53.815
Oh, no.

408
00:49:23.665 --> 00:49:25.395
Please still here.

409
00:49:29.613 --> 00:49:31.203
Oh my God.

410
00:49:36.445 --> 00:49:37.965
Frankie!

411
00:49:38.515 --> 00:49:39.805
Oh, God.

412
00:49:51.255 --> 00:49:52.684
What happened to the people
that were in this car?


413
00:49:52.685 --> 00:49:53.754
They have me right
when I pulled him down.


414
00:49:53.755 --> 00:49:55.135
He was driving like a crazy man.

415
00:49:55.195 --> 00:49:58.593
- Okay, did you see a little boy?
- Yeah, they went down that way.


416
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.796
Just wait, the police on their way.

417
00:50:00.875 --> 00:50:03.718
That little boy is my son and
the man he was with kidnapped him.


418
00:50:03.805 --> 00:50:05.929
- So tell the cops that.
- They'll be here in a minute.


419
00:50:06.075 --> 00:50:07.625
Can't wait!

420
00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:11.035
There's a police station
up the road right in town!


421
00:50:27.635 --> 00:50:30.757
My son has been kidnapped.
Has anybody contacted you?


422
00:50:30.905 --> 00:50:33.312
His name is Frankie,
he's six years old.


423
00:50:33.395 --> 00:50:38.964
And he's wearing a blue and red shirt
and he's wearing little black glasses.


424
00:50:39.016 --> 00:50:40.484
And this right here is something I have...

425
00:50:40.555 --> 00:50:42.908
a woman's voice on the exact moment
that she was taking him.


426
00:50:42.955 --> 00:50:45.734
She's talking on here.
She's a big huge lady.


427
00:50:45.782 --> 00:50:48.434
And right now he is with a man...

428
00:50:48.482 --> 00:50:50.804
Okay, calm down.
We're gonna call it in immediately.


429
00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:53.094
- What's your name, ma'am.
- My name is Karla Dyson.


430
00:50:53.215 --> 00:50:56.324
- Describe the suspect for me.
- He's tall, skinny, white.


431
00:50:56.399 --> 00:50:59.457
He has a red baseball cap
with blonde hair sticking out of it.


432
00:50:59.505 --> 00:51:06.094
And he has on like a gray or blue,
some kind of work uniform, I don't know.


433
00:51:06.149 --> 00:51:07.656
Wait a minute.

434
00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:10.075
- Is nobody here with you?
- No, ma'am.


435
00:51:10.158 --> 00:51:12.798
But we can have a hundred cars
looking for them in an hour, okay?


436
00:51:12.865 --> 00:51:14.524
- An hour? Oh my God, in an hour?
- I just need you to be patient.


437
00:51:14.572 --> 00:51:16.662
My son is gonna
be dead in an hour!

438
00:51:16.961 --> 00:51:18.590
No, no, it's going online.

439
00:51:18.685 --> 00:51:21.674
Every cop in the Parish
is gonna be looking for him, Karla.


440
00:51:21.727 --> 00:51:23.462
Oh, God.

441
00:51:27.595 --> 00:51:29.734
Issuing amber alert
for a potential kidnapping.


442
00:51:29.908 --> 00:51:33.477
A six years old African-American boy.
Last seen wearing a blue and red shirt.


443
00:51:33.525 --> 00:51:36.854
Responds to Frankie Dyson.
The mother is here with me at the station.


444
00:51:36.923 --> 00:51:38.294
Do you have a
cellphone that I can use...

445
00:51:38.438 --> 00:51:40.455
so if I go out there I can call and
stay in touch with you?


446
00:51:40.532 --> 00:51:43.204
No, ma'am. But you can use that phone
right over on that wall.


447
00:51:43.252 --> 00:51:44.540
I cannot use that phone?
It's right there.


448
00:51:44.599 --> 00:51:46.321
Anyone you need to call?

449
00:51:47.229 --> 00:51:48.779
Your husband?

450
00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.630
Okay, my husband, yes.

451
00:51:51.855 --> 00:51:55.399
- I need to call my husband.
- 9 in the area code.


452
00:51:56.165 --> 00:51:58.446
I've put out an APP for Jefferson Parish.

453
00:51:58.641 --> 00:52:00.235
You just need to wait, Karla.

454
00:52:00.396 --> 00:52:03.395
<i>You've reach David Dyson.
I'm away from my desk right now.</i>


455
00:52:03.475 --> 00:52:06.145
<i>I'll get back to you
as soon as possible. Thank you.</i>


456
00:52:06.705 --> 00:52:08.149
Hi, David.

457
00:52:08.725 --> 00:52:09.945
It's me.

458
00:52:11.255 --> 00:52:13.985
I am in a police station in Chester.

459
00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:17.045
Frankie's been kidnapped.

460
00:52:17.579 --> 00:52:19.359
Happened at the park.

461
00:52:20.255 --> 00:52:23.435
The police are out doing everything
they can looking for him.


462
00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:28.065
And they said that all we have to do now
is just sit right and wait.


463
00:53:00.699 --> 00:53:02.529
That's what all these people did.

464
00:53:09.775 --> 00:53:11.355
They waited.

465
00:53:18.535 --> 00:53:20.555
Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.
Ma'am? Ma'am?


466
00:53:38.074 --> 00:53:41.424
Excuse me, did you see a man
with a little boy?


467
00:53:55.764 --> 00:53:57.889
Is that your jacket?

468
00:54:01.344 --> 00:54:03.365
That's your jacket.

469
00:54:40.914 --> 00:54:42.475
Frankie?

470
00:55:13.448 --> 00:55:16.503
I found you, you son of a bitch!

471
00:57:02.315 --> 00:57:06.685
No! No, that's not it!
It's a black Volvo!


472
00:57:07.103 --> 00:57:08.963
Goddamnit!

473
00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.810
Goddamnit.

474
00:59:15.725 --> 00:59:19.325
No! You are not opening that door!

475
00:59:22.371 --> 00:59:24.051
I said no!

476
00:59:30.494 --> 00:59:32.354
Fuck you!

477
00:59:35.273 --> 00:59:36.788
No!

478
00:59:45.095 --> 00:59:46.673
Oh, God. No!

479
00:59:47.112 --> 00:59:48.298
No!

480
00:59:48.517 --> 00:59:50.915
No, no, no...

481
00:59:52.515 --> 00:59:54.455
Don't stop, don't stop.

482
01:01:31.296 --> 01:01:33.507
- I need help!
- Are you alright?


483
01:01:33.555 --> 01:01:35.616
- Do you have a phone?
- I got a radio.


484
01:01:35.675 --> 01:01:38.125
Call 911.
My son has been kidnapped!


485
01:01:38.635 --> 01:01:41.817
- Call 911.
- Okay, but I got to go this way.


486
01:01:41.895 --> 01:01:44.223
- I don't get a reception over here.
- But they went that way!


487
01:01:44.295 --> 01:01:46.055
That way is a dead end.

488
01:01:47.215 --> 01:01:49.442
Dead end? What do you mean?

489
01:01:49.535 --> 01:01:50.665
Look out!

490
01:03:46.845 --> 01:03:49.352
Damnit! Where's my shells?

491
01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:33.775
You had to keep coming, didn't you?

492
01:05:45.635 --> 01:05:47.445
Where's my son?

493
01:05:49.025 --> 01:05:51.195
Where's my son!

494
01:06:23.095 --> 01:06:26.375
Terrence Vicky? 
Is that who you are?

495
01:06:28.155 --> 01:06:29.485
Were.

496
01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:34.635
125, Route 77.

497
01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.665
Okay.

498
01:06:37.572 --> 01:06:39.368
Let's see.

499
01:06:45.215 --> 01:06:48.425
<i>Continue on route 77 for 2 miles.</i>

500
01:06:48.585 --> 01:06:51.345
<i>Your destination will be on the left.</i>

501
01:11:18.784 --> 01:11:20.004
Hello?

502
01:11:22.015 --> 01:11:23.575
He ain't here.

503
01:11:25.065 --> 01:11:29.425
Yes, we got another one
and now everything is gone to shit!


504
01:11:32.675 --> 01:11:37.725
Okay, then the price just doubled
because this mother has become a problem.


505
01:11:40.666 --> 01:11:44.893
I told you Terry ain't here.
I had to hitch a ride back.


506
01:11:45.787 --> 01:11:49.427
He's out taking care of the problem.

507
01:11:51.713 --> 01:11:54.549
Just remember,
you are just the middleman.


508
01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:57.690
It'll be a $100,000 or you get nothing.

509
01:12:53.451 --> 01:12:55.684
<i>911 operator, what's your emergency?</i>

510
01:12:55.778 --> 01:12:57.038
I need help.

511
01:13:00.575 --> 01:13:01.670
<i>Ma'am?</i>

512
01:13:01.888 --> 01:13:04.420
<i>Ma'am, are you there? Ma'am?</i>

513
01:13:05.735 --> 01:13:07.004
<i>Ma'am, we're here with you.</i>

514
01:13:07.061 --> 01:13:09.154
<i>We're keeping the line open,
we're gonna get you some help.</i>


515
01:13:09.217 --> 01:13:10.324
<i>Do not hang up.</i>

516
01:13:10.389 --> 01:13:12.925
<i>I'm gonna place you on hold
while we triangulate your location.</i>


517
01:13:13.002 --> 01:13:14.792
<i>I'll be right back with you.</i>

518
01:13:40.115 --> 01:13:42.014
<i>Ma'am, I'm back. 
Is it safe to talk?</i>

519
01:13:42.091 --> 01:13:44.955
- What is your emergency?
- My son has been kidnapped.


520
01:13:45.198 --> 01:13:47.448
And I'm in the house where I think
they're keeping him.


521
01:13:47.585 --> 01:13:50.104
<i>We think we found you.
Can you verified your address?</i>


522
01:13:50.185 --> 01:13:52.385
Yes. 125, route 77.

523
01:13:52.654 --> 01:13:55.524
<i>And do you know if there's anyone else
in the house with you, ma'am?</i>


524
01:13:56.402 --> 01:13:57.801
I don't know, I'm not sure, but...

525
01:13:57.849 --> 01:14:02.560
But the woman that took him is out
in a barn or some house.


526
01:14:02.608 --> 01:14:03.661
It's near where I am.

527
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:05.435
<i>I've already contacted
the dispatch officers.</i>


528
01:14:05.483 --> 01:14:06.411
<i>They're on the way.</i>

529
01:14:06.459 --> 01:14:08.458
<i>You need to find a safe place
to wait until they're arrive.</i>


530
01:14:08.506 --> 01:14:10.092
Okay.
How long is that gonna take?


531
01:14:10.149 --> 01:14:11.483
<i>They'll be there very soon.</i>

532
01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:13.326
<i>I just need you to stay
on the line with me, okay?</i>


533
01:14:13.374 --> 01:14:14.146
Okay.

534
01:14:14.194 --> 01:14:17.178
- Is that gonna be like 5 minutes?
- Between 7-15 minutes, ma'am.


535
01:14:17.232 --> 01:14:19.865
Oh, God, 15 minutes...
That's a long time.


536
01:14:19.944 --> 01:14:21.802
<i>It's alright, ma'am.
The police are on their way.</i>


537
01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:25.686
<i>I need you to get to a safe place,
stay here on the line with me now, okay?</i>


538
01:14:28.069 --> 01:14:30.647
<i>Would you let me know when
you find a safe place to hide?</i>


539
01:14:31.355 --> 01:14:32.835
<i>Ma'am, are you there?</i>

540
01:14:33.365 --> 01:14:36.694
- Ma'am? Ma'am?
- Hang up, hang up.


541
01:14:38.014 --> 01:14:39.238
Oh, God.

542
01:14:45.953 --> 01:14:47.418
Terry!

543
01:14:49.258 --> 01:14:51.478
Terry, are you back?

544
01:14:53.617 --> 01:14:56.398
Terry, was that you on the phone?

I can't, honey,
because the ladder is locked.

01:25:10.263 --> 01:25:11.607
Yeah.

609
01:25:12.395 --> 01:25:14.619
She and her husband kidnapped my son.
