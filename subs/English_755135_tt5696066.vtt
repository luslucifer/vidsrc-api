2
00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:17.030
Yeah, it's nice and quaint.

3
00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:18.198
It is.

4
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.367
Where are the people again?

5
00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.284
I don't know.

6
00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.828
Why don't we find out?

7
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.664
Hello, Bog Grove, grove, grove.

8
00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:28.291
Repeat after me.

9
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:29.168
Repeat.

10
00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:31.128
You do it.

11
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.754
Hello, Bog Grove.

12
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.968
You're my kryptonite.

13
00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.763
- Just ask my parents.
- Mm hm.


14
00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:44.391
Well, that's why your mom hates me.

15
00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:46.643
But I am reformed, remember?

16
00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.938
- Mm, that's what you say.
- Mm hm.


17
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.692
Look.

18
00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:55.902
Look at how beautiful this is.

19
00:03:55.944 --> 00:03:56.820
Isn't it amazing?

20
00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:58.989
What do you think?

21
00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:02.325
It looks like something out

22
00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:03.869
of a Norman Rockwell painting.

23
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:05.913
It's cool.

24
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.582
I'm telling you we're
gonna have a magical weekend.


25
00:04:08.624 --> 00:04:09.749
Okay?

26
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.626
I promise.

27
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:13.045
Come here.

28
00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:40.697
Hello?

29
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:45.285
Hello?

30
00:04:47.246 --> 00:04:49.539
Huh, again, where is everybody?

31
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.208
Hello?

32
00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:53.669
- Knock, knock.
- Hello?


33
00:04:56.964 --> 00:04:58.006
Hello?

34
00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:59.716
Hello?

35
00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.638
Again, where are all the people?

36
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.098
I don't know.

37
00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:07.182
Hello?

38
00:05:13.063 --> 00:05:14.773
Oh, incoming!

39
00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:18.402
I think that's a new record.

40
00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:22.281
Gotta keep the talons tame.

41
00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:27.452
- Hello.
- Blue eyes, red hair.


42
00:05:28.203 --> 00:05:31.539
Third wife, I liked her.

43
00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.168
Hope he's not the chef.

44
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.671
Oh, I happen to do that too.

45
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:40.632
I'm Gene.

46
00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.844
Welcome to the Cozy Nook.

47
00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:46.388
- Huh?
- I'm Bobby.


48
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.639
This is my girlfriend, Jules.

49
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.015
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.


50
00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.475
I'll let you in on a little secret.

51
00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.894
- Okay.
- Most folks say


52
00:05:52.936 --> 00:05:55.856
after spending one day in Bog Grove,

53
00:05:56.481 --> 00:06:01.111
they just can't leave.

54
00:06:01.153 --> 00:06:01.861
Huh?

55
00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:04.573
I gotta get back to a
recording session on Monday.


56
00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.702
Sorry, so, let's just play it by ear.

57
00:06:09.828 --> 00:06:11.705
Or we can always
just take a ferry home

58
00:06:11.747 --> 00:06:13.581
in the morning if we need to.

59
00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.083
No ferry service tomorrow.

60
00:06:15.125 --> 00:06:16.168
Okay.

61
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.128
Oh, that's confusing.

62
00:06:18.754 --> 00:06:19.838
Why not?

63
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.423
Is it because there's
a holiday or something?


64
00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:23.008
You might say that.

65
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.301
Just that there's a little history

66
00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:25.677
on the island, that's all.

67
00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.638
Don't worry.

68
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.766
You kids are gonna have a great day.

69
00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.477
Look at this.

70
00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:40.025
- All right, this way.
- All right.


71
00:06:40.067 --> 00:06:43.737
A beautiful lighting
table here, kitchenette,


72
00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:46.406
there's your bathroom,
your beautiful bedroom,


73
00:06:46.448 --> 00:06:48.533
ceiling fans in both rooms.

74
00:06:49.284 --> 00:06:54.664
And now, for the Pierre
Cardin de la resistance,


75
00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.959
a beautiful view of the island.

76
00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:00.962
Complete with your own private balcony.

77
00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:03.173
- Huh?
- Nice, I love it.


78
00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.593
It's a good nookie vibe in here, huh?

79
00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:11.264
Enjoy yourselves, kids.

80
00:07:13.892 --> 00:07:15.769
- Thanks, Gene.
- Welcome.


81
00:07:21.191 --> 00:07:23.568
- Check this out.
- Look at this view.


82
00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:26.654
Wow.

83
00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.073
Look at this.

84
00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:36.081
Okay, does any of
this look familiar to you?


85
00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.500
No, I don't remember any of it.

86
00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:39.793
I was so young.

87
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:44.714
If you told me
we were going on vacation

88
00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:47.634
a couple weeks ago, I would
have told you you were crazy.


89
00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:49.719
There's nothing wrong with going

90
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:51.221
a little crazy once in a while.

91
00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.724
Yeah, I just hate when we fight.

92
00:07:54.766 --> 00:07:56.518
Yeah, well, all couples fight.

93
00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.853
Hey, I love you.

94
00:07:59.187 --> 00:08:00.564
I love you.

95
00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:16.538
It's Gene.

96
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.457
Everything okay in there?

97
00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.251
Uh, Gene, yeah, we're good, buddy.

98
00:08:21.293 --> 00:08:22.502
Thank you.

99
00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.009
These walls are really, really thin.

100
00:08:30.051 --> 00:08:32.470
He's probably got his ear
against the door right now.


101
00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:39.394
Hm, he's probably outside
there clipping his fingernails.


102
00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.396
Is he?

103
00:08:41.438 --> 00:08:43.231
Oh, yeah.

104
00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:50.947
Ooh, I like makeup sex.

105
00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:53.825
Yeah.

106
00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.393
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Hm?


107
00:10:01.643 --> 00:10:03.645
Who set the alarm for 6:45?

108
00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.859
Calm down, ray of sunshine.

109
00:10:09.901 --> 00:10:12.028
You must've done it outta habit.

110
00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.530
That's not me.

111
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:15.240
That thing is from the '70s.

112
00:10:15.282 --> 00:10:16.616
I don't know how to work it.

113
00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:23.123
Well, I'm awake now.

114
00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.212
Yeah, it's really beautiful.

115
00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:37.387
Huh, why don't we get
out there and explore.


116
00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:40.682
Soak up the local culture.

117
00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:44.269
Bog Grove culture?

118
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:45.604
Absolutely.

119
00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.147
I'm just kidding.

120
00:10:47.397 --> 00:10:48.356
Of course.

121
00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:51.067
Hey, I love you.

122
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.988
Anything you want, we're in, I'm game.

123
00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.161
You really love me, huh?

124
00:11:02.871 --> 00:11:04.706
I know you may not believe this,

125
00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.000
but you're the only girl I've ever loved.

126
00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:09.419
Hm, you're right.

127
00:11:09.628 --> 00:11:11.171
I don't believe you.

128
00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:16.009
Hey, look, I've used those words before,

129
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.594
but I never meant it.

130
00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:20.347
With you it's different.

131
00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:25.143
I'd never hurt you.

132
00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:26.895
You know that, right?

133
00:11:29.314 --> 00:11:30.649
Interesting.

134
00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:36.821
- What about Ashley?
- That, no.


135
00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:42.452
We promised not to talk about
that while we're here, okay?


136
00:11:45.372 --> 00:11:48.166
I already know, I just
needed to hear you say it.


137
00:11:49.668 --> 00:11:50.877
Why?

138
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.713
Because it's important.

139
00:11:54.881 --> 00:11:57.550
Jesus Christ.

140
00:11:57.592 --> 00:11:58.635
It's Gene.

141
00:11:58.677 --> 00:12:00.595
Everything all right in there?

142
00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:07.393
Uh, yeah, Gene, thanks.

143
00:12:07.435 --> 00:12:09.312
Everything's great.

144
00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:13.274
Why did, how are his toenails?

145
00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:14.818
What is this guy doing?

146
00:12:15.902 --> 00:12:17.987
Don't want your
breakfast to get cold.


147
00:12:19.447 --> 00:12:20.490
Thanks, buddy.

148
00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:23.951
Wow, they're on it here, huh?

149
00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.578
It's like he left.

150
00:12:25.954 --> 00:12:27.831
It's like he never left the door.

151
00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:31.668
Hey, you think
I can smoke in here?


152
00:12:32.836 --> 00:12:34.045
I doubt it.

153
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.807
What's this, "To Bobby?"

154
00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:49.018
I wrote you a letter.

155
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:50.728
When'd you do that?

156
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.230
When we were fighting.

157
00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:53.940
In case I forgot all the terrible,

158
00:12:53.982 --> 00:12:55.942
terrible things I wanted to say to you.

159
00:12:57.986 --> 00:12:59.320
That sounds great.

160
00:13:02.157 --> 00:13:03.742
Why don't you go shower

161
00:13:04.367 --> 00:13:07.120
and we'll read it together
later for a laugh.


162
00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:08.246
Okay.

163
00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.873
Well, can you do me a favor?

164
00:13:10.874 --> 00:13:12.417
Burn that letter.

165
00:13:12.459 --> 00:13:13.710
Ha, ha, ha.

166
00:13:13.752 --> 00:13:15.754
Tell your mom I said hi.

167
00:13:48.953 --> 00:13:49.871
Hey, Gene.

168
00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:52.123
- Hey, good morning.
- Hey, good morning.


169
00:13:53.708 --> 00:13:55.293
I just noticed the bathroom this morning

170
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:56.377
and I wanted to mention it.

171
00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.629
It's pretty messy right now.

172
00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:00.423
Oh, sorry about that.

173
00:14:00.799 --> 00:14:02.842
I'll have Shelly tidy up in there later.

174
00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:07.722
Don't you guys usually
tidy up before people arrive?


175
00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.517
Well, sometimes Shelly
gets the numbers mixed up.


176
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.351
Not a problem, I'll have
her take care of it.


177
00:14:12.393 --> 00:14:16.063
- Okay.
- You two were up kinda early.


178
00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:17.648
Most couples like to sleep in

179
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.734
a little late on their vacation.

180
00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:23.738
Um, why is it so dead around here?

181
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.074
Isn't this supposed to be like
the perfect winter getaway?


182
00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:29.452
It is, but not this weekend.

183
00:14:30.161 --> 00:14:32.163
I'm surprised there's anyone here at all.

184
00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.290
Yeah, what's up with that?

185
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.668
Well, something...

186
00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.712
Gene, come on.

187
00:14:39.754 --> 00:14:41.589
What is, what's, what are you not saying

188
00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.299
obviously what happened here?

189
00:14:47.303 --> 00:14:49.389
Oh, it was bad things.

190
00:14:50.265 --> 00:14:52.100
Very bad things.

191
00:14:52.892 --> 00:14:55.103
Let's just leave it at that.

192
00:14:56.062 --> 00:14:59.106
Look, forget I said anything.

193
00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:00.233
Forget it.

194
00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:02.068
I mean, what's past is the past.

195
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.778
Nobody can change that.

196
00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:07.240
Most important thing
for you is to make sure


197
00:15:07.282 --> 00:15:10.285
you make wonderful, beautiful
memories on our island.


198
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:14.497
Take some pictures, take 'em
home and make a scrapbook.


199
00:15:15.373 --> 00:15:16.666
That's some great advice.

200
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:18.084
I appreciate that, Gene.

201
00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.294
Yeah.

202
00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:20.837
Oh, look at that.

203
00:15:20.879 --> 00:15:22.463
You missed one right there.

204
00:15:24.382 --> 00:15:25.258
Hm.

205
00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.135
What?

206
00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:29.345
Thanks, Gene.

207
00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.473
What do you think he was talking about?

208
00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:33.140
I don't know.

209
00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.351
I think the whole thing's promotional.

210
00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:37.019
Oh, really, promotional?

211
00:15:37.061 --> 00:15:41.315
Yeah, he tells us a scary
story, we tell somebody else


212
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:43.359
a scary story and
so forth and so on,

213
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.819
and business is booming.

214
00:15:45.153 --> 00:15:46.904
Wait, why would he do that?

215
00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:47.947
I don't understand.

216
00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:49.824
I don't know, tourism is down.

217
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:53.244
Bog Grove ain't quite the tourism mecca.

218
00:15:53.286 --> 00:15:54.328
What do you think?

219
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.455
Look at it.

220
00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:59.125
If this story grows, he might
get like a ghost hunting show


221
00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:00.626
that comes here and then you got

222
00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:03.838
1,000 asshats with selfie sticks.

223
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.465
Boom, business is booming.

224
00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:08.217
- You think?
- Yeah.


225
00:16:09.552 --> 00:16:11.721
You know what, I bet we
could leave here and get


226
00:16:11.763 --> 00:16:14.432
a t-shirt that says,
"I survived Bog Grove."


227
00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:23.357
Anyway, you ready to get out there?

228
00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:24.275
Let's go.

229
00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.824
Here.

230
00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.785
- Nice.
- Oh, look at that, babe.


231
00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.079
Yeah.

232
00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:50.218
Hey, babe, it says "Jules."

233
00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:53.304
Nice.

234
00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:08.527
Ooh, nice.

235
00:17:12.198 --> 00:17:14.158
Whoopi Goldberg, "Ghost."

236
00:17:18.037 --> 00:17:19.706
Demi Moore.

237
00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:21.624
Nailed it.

238
00:17:26.129 --> 00:17:27.755
"16 Candles."

239
00:17:31.509 --> 00:17:32.802
"Ghost Rider."

240
00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:39.142
Grandma?

241
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.270
Wow, what's this?

242
00:17:44.731 --> 00:17:47.358
"Free historical movies every 10 minutes."

243
00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:49.944
What do you think,
you wanna check it out?

244
00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.821
- Heck yeah.
- Okay.


245
00:17:59.412 --> 00:18:02.540
Okay, even I'm bored by this.

246
00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:03.708
Oh, thank god you said that.

247
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.585
All right, I'm game.

248
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.004
Hm.

249
00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:12.091
Well, that was interesting.

250
00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:16.262
So strange.

251
00:18:23.227 --> 00:18:24.311
I remember coming here.

252
00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:26.647
I used to hang out and play
"Donkey Kong" all the time.


253
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:29.776
"Donkey Kong."

254
00:18:30.026 --> 00:18:31.277
Wanna try one out?

255
00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:32.528
- Yeah.
- This is the one right here.


256
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.407
- Oh, great.
- Yeah, here it is.


257
00:18:36.866 --> 00:18:38.117
You play pinball?

258
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:39.994
Couple times.

259
00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:45.124
This is the game that my
dad and I used to play when


260
00:18:45.166 --> 00:18:48.836
he had a few extra quarters
coming off a bender or whatever.


261
00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:51.964
Come on, let's go.

262
00:18:53.341 --> 00:18:55.676
Hey, easy, easy, tiger.

263
00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:58.930
You break it, I buy it.

264
00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:00.890
Calm down, hey, hey, hey!

265
00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:04.602
Really?

266
00:19:05.311 --> 00:19:06.646
Really.

267
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.773
We're just having fun, right?

268
00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:09.982
So, let's just have fun.

269
00:19:10.024 --> 00:19:11.192
Take it easy.

270
00:19:15.113 --> 00:19:17.448
Did you ever live
on an island like this?

271
00:19:18.032 --> 00:19:19.283
Heck no.

272
00:19:19.867 --> 00:19:22.411
I wanted to, when I was little especially.

273
00:19:23.037 --> 00:19:26.415
Yeah, "Robinson Crusoe."

274
00:19:38.261 --> 00:19:40.304
You're such the romantic.

275
00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:43.724
I love you.

276
00:19:43.766 --> 00:19:46.519
You know that's gonna
wash away in like no time.


277
00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:49.355
Nothing lasts forever.

278
00:19:54.861 --> 00:19:56.195
Fuckin' starving.

279
00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:00.282
This it?

280
00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:03.244
- How you livin', all right?
- Yeah, good.


281
00:20:03.286 --> 00:20:05.705
We are livin' the dream.

282
00:20:06.247 --> 00:20:08.999
The dream is real.

283
00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.543
- Oh, hey.
- Okay, guys.


284
00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:12.253
- Ah, yes.
- And if you need anything


285
00:20:12.295 --> 00:20:13.295
else let me know, my name is Pearl.

286
00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:14.964
- Thank you, Pearl.
- Thanks, Pearl.


287
00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.091
Yeah.

288
00:20:21.262 --> 00:20:22.930
How you guys doing over here?

289
00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.141
You want a beer with those burgers?

290
00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:26.851
- We're fine.
- We'll take a water.


291
00:20:26.893 --> 00:20:28.102
Water's good.

292
00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:33.566
Why are you in a fucking bar

293
00:20:33.608 --> 00:20:35.818
if you're not gonna have a drink?

294
00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:38.696
Shut the hell up would you, Brooklyn?

295
00:20:39.697 --> 00:20:41.073
My name's Larry.

296
00:20:41.657 --> 00:20:43.242
They call me Legosh.

297
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:49.331
I have no idea why, but
if you guys need anything,


298
00:20:49.373 --> 00:20:53.544
if I can do anything to
help you, you let me know.


299
00:20:53.586 --> 00:20:55.337
Appreciate it, man.

300
00:20:55.379 --> 00:20:56.380
Yeah.

301
00:20:57.048 --> 00:20:59.467
You guys sure you're okay?

302
00:21:00.009 --> 00:21:01.010
I'm totally fine, man.

303
00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:02.219
Just an unexpected early morning.

304
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:05.389
- That's all.
- Hey, girl.


305
00:21:06.557 --> 00:21:11.729
Why don't you ditch the
stick and go with the chick?


306
00:21:13.356 --> 00:21:16.192
It's a first time for that one.

307
00:21:16.234 --> 00:21:19.153
Brooklyn, did you
swallow a book of poetry?


308
00:21:23.074 --> 00:21:25.868
What's up, where do
you wanna go after this?


309
00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:29.622
It's just this guy
in the booth is just,

310
00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:31.374
is just like staring at me.

311
00:21:31.666 --> 00:21:32.458
You're a good looking girl,

312
00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.460
you get stared at all the time.

313
00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:37.046
He's kinda freaking me out
a little bit, that's all.


314
00:21:46.681 --> 00:21:48.683
Yo,.

315
00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:50.309
You got a problem, dude?

316
00:21:53.229 --> 00:21:54.605
Okay.

317
00:21:54.647 --> 00:21:56.273
I give you new and
improved Bobby Patterson.


318
00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:57.483
Bobby, stop!

319
00:21:57.525 --> 00:21:58.734
You think it's cool looking at my girl?

320
00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:00.236
Fuckin' smack that off your face.

321
00:22:00.278 --> 00:22:04.573
Mm, and without a punch thrown.

322
00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:05.950
My hero.

323
00:22:06.033 --> 00:22:07.743
I know, totally boring.

324
00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:12.540
I hope she dumps your ass.

325
00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:15.042
Okay.

326
00:22:15.167 --> 00:22:17.503
I love that
idea, I love exploring.


327
00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:20.214
Okay.

328
00:22:20.256 --> 00:22:21.716
What do you want?

329
00:22:28.097 --> 00:22:29.181
What's wrong?

330
00:22:29.849 --> 00:22:30.516
Oh, nothing.

331
00:22:30.558 --> 00:22:33.102
I was just thinking about
the story my mom told


332
00:22:33.185 --> 00:22:35.479
about this couple traveling to Colorado.

333
00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:36.772
Mm hm.

334
00:22:36.856 --> 00:22:39.483
I guess they got killed
by a bunch of locals.


335
00:22:40.234 --> 00:22:41.610
When did she tell you that?

336
00:22:41.652 --> 00:22:43.738
This morning when I called her.

337
00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:45.864
- Oh, you got through?
- Yeah, barely.


338
00:22:45.906 --> 00:22:47.574
My phone died halfway through.

339
00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:49.201
- Ah.
- No more phone.


340
00:22:49.243 --> 00:22:51.036
Why's she gotta be so morbid?

341
00:22:51.078 --> 00:22:53.414
I guess that's just her
way of saying be careful.


342
00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:55.166
Well, she has a point.

343
00:22:56.042 --> 00:22:57.126
Marry me, Jules.

344
00:22:57.168 --> 00:22:58.669
- What?
- Yeah.


345
00:22:58.836 --> 00:23:01.463
- But we were just fighting.
- Yeah, I know, I know.


346
00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:02.715
It...

347
00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:07.803
It took me almost losing you
to realize how much I love you.


348
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.723
And I know this isn't ideal,

349
00:23:10.931 --> 00:23:12.683
but I don't know what that means.

350
00:23:13.934 --> 00:23:16.937
I wanna prove to you that I can
be the man that you deserve.


351
00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:19.899
I love you.

352
00:23:21.859 --> 00:23:23.736
What?

353
00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.407
- I love you.
- I love you.


354
00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:34.914
What?

355
00:23:36.415 --> 00:23:37.792
Would you like to head back?

356
00:23:38.834 --> 00:23:41.837
Um, no, let's keep walking.

357
00:23:41.879 --> 00:23:44.382
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's a beautiful day.


358
00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:46.008
- Okay.
- Yeah.


359
00:23:51.639 --> 00:23:53.808
I wish this day could last forever.

360
00:24:39.687 --> 00:24:41.981
Oh, my God, you gotta be kidding me.

361
00:24:47.069 --> 00:24:48.904
Calm down, ray of sunshine.

362
00:24:48.946 --> 00:24:50.823
You must've done it outta habit.

363
00:24:56.287 --> 00:24:57.580
What time is it?

364
00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:00.833
It's 6:45.

365
00:25:01.667 --> 00:25:03.586
Holy shit, I had the weirdest dream.

366
00:25:05.588 --> 00:25:06.755
Oh, what was it?

367
00:25:06.797 --> 00:25:07.923
It was...

368
00:25:09.925 --> 00:25:11.093
You know what?

369
00:25:13.137 --> 00:25:14.096
Don't worry about it.

370
00:25:14.138 --> 00:25:15.556
You just go to bed, okay?

371
00:25:16.474 --> 00:25:17.683
What was it, what was your dream?

372
00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:18.642
I'll tell you what it means.

373
00:25:20.144 --> 00:25:21.186
It's Gene.

374
00:25:21.228 --> 00:25:22.730
Everything okay in there?

375
00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:26.442
Yeah, everything's fine in here, Gene.

376
00:25:26.484 --> 00:25:27.693
Thank you.

377
00:25:28.819 --> 00:25:30.696
What does he think we're doing in here?

378
00:25:32.239 --> 00:25:33.699
It's like he never left the door.

379
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:34.783
Yeah.

380
00:25:48.255 --> 00:25:50.382
Hey, I don't think
you can smoke in here.


381
00:25:54.261 --> 00:25:56.639
Oh, yeah, that's right, um...

382
00:25:59.016 --> 00:26:02.061
Oh, yeah, I wrote you a letter.

383
00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:11.946
Hey, why don't you go shower.

384
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:15.157
I'm gonna call my mom to see
if I can get through to her.


385
00:26:15.616 --> 00:26:17.451
Let her know I'm alive.

386
00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:20.746
Should I tell her you said hi?

387
00:26:23.165 --> 00:26:24.416
Okay.

388
00:26:38.889 --> 00:26:42.768
And then, strike three.

389
00:26:53.362 --> 00:26:54.572
Morning.

390
00:26:55.531 --> 00:26:57.574
Hey, sorry about the bathroom.

391
00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.994
I'll have Shelly tidy up in there later.

392
00:27:01.203 --> 00:27:03.205
The two of you are up early.

393
00:27:03.831 --> 00:27:06.792
Most folks like to sleep in late, huh?

394
00:27:06.834 --> 00:27:07.751
Yeah.

395
00:27:08.085 --> 00:27:10.963
Why is it so quiet around here, Gene?

396
00:27:11.422 --> 00:27:12.548
Well...

397
00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:23.892
Something happened on the
island a few years ago.


398
00:27:24.602 --> 00:27:26.854
Now, I don't wanna get
you all in a tizzy,

399
00:27:27.771 --> 00:27:29.439
but a couple visiting Bog Grove

400
00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:31.316
were Killed over by the cathedral.

401
00:27:31.358 --> 00:27:33.277
- Over by the cathedral.
- Oh, my God.


402
00:27:34.862 --> 00:27:35.863
Killed?

403
00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:39.491
The girl's throat was slashed.

404
00:27:39.783 --> 00:27:43.078
Her fella's neck snapped like a twig.

405
00:27:46.999 --> 00:27:51.795
Well, do they, do
they know who did it?

406
00:27:52.755 --> 00:27:53.797
No.

407
00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:57.885
They never caught the guy.

408
00:28:00.596 --> 00:28:03.724
Cops never found any
evidence at the scene.


409
00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:08.979
No DNA, no prints, nothing.

410
00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:11.898
Outta respect for the
families, the town decided


411
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.153
no ferry service on the
anniversary of their death.


412
00:28:20.324 --> 00:28:21.200
Hm.

413
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.370
God, a terrible, terrible tragedy.

414
00:28:27.665 --> 00:28:30.584
Anyway, you two have fun

415
00:28:30.626 --> 00:28:31.877
out there, all right?

416
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.008
Oh, look at that.

417
00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:42.721
You think I look British?

418
00:28:47.518 --> 00:28:49.186
Hey, babe, it says Jules.

419
00:28:50.479 --> 00:28:51.814
"16 Candles."

420
00:28:54.608 --> 00:28:55.943
"Baywatch."

421
00:28:56.985 --> 00:28:58.278
"Demi Moore."

422
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:00.280
"Soundgarden."

423
00:29:00.322 --> 00:29:02.074
Oh, woo!

424
00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:03.200
Yeah!

425
00:29:22.386 --> 00:29:23.345
You okay?

426
00:29:24.847 --> 00:29:28.392
I feel like I'm having like
serious, serious deja vu.


427
00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:35.315
Well, you were here as a
kid, so maybe that's why.


428
00:29:35.899 --> 00:29:40.195
No, I mean, I mean the whole day.

429
00:29:40.237 --> 00:29:44.491
Like everything you say and
like everything that I do is,


430
00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:47.578
we've already said it and
we've done it already before.


431
00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:49.621
Stop messing with me.

432
00:29:49.663 --> 00:29:50.539
Come on.

433
00:29:50.581 --> 00:29:52.791
No, I, I mean it.

434
00:29:54.293 --> 00:29:55.586
It feels like a dream.

435
00:29:58.046 --> 00:30:00.507
Like I'm watching us, you know?

436
00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:05.304
Okay, if that's true,
then what happens to us?


437
00:30:09.183 --> 00:30:10.851
Hey, hey, hey.

438
00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:13.103
Hey, you're okay.

439
00:30:14.938 --> 00:30:15.856
Hey, listen to me.

440
00:30:15.898 --> 00:30:17.357
Let's go get some air, okay?

441
00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:38.253
Okay, guys, here you go.

442
00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:39.588
And if you need
anything else let me know.

443
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.256
- My name is Pearl.
- Thank you.


444
00:30:43.884 --> 00:30:45.969
Hey, can we go
some place else to eat?

445
00:30:46.011 --> 00:30:47.429
Okay, but Gene said
this place was great,


446
00:30:47.513 --> 00:30:48.930
so let's just stay here.

447
00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:51.391
I don't, I don't care
about his Yelp review.


448
00:30:51.433 --> 00:30:52.851
I really don't.

449
00:30:52.976 --> 00:30:54.686
- Can we just-
- Baby, we're already here.


450
00:30:55.062 --> 00:30:56.354
Well, let's go some place different.

451
00:30:56.396 --> 00:30:58.315
Let's try something new, right?

452
00:30:58.357 --> 00:31:01.109
Okay, because we come to
Bog Grove every weekend.


453
00:31:01.151 --> 00:31:03.570
No, I mean, let's go to a
different town, all right?


454
00:31:03.612 --> 00:31:05.238
A different hotel, try something new-

455
00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.574
Hey, hey, listen, listen.

456
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:11.286
You just, you had a bad
dream or whatever it was.


457
00:31:11.328 --> 00:31:12.370
You're fine, okay?

458
00:31:12.412 --> 00:31:14.706
We're fine, I promise.

459
00:31:18.293 --> 00:31:19.920
And listen, we don't come here often,

460
00:31:19.962 --> 00:31:21.797
so let's just enjoy it while we're here.

461
00:31:21.839 --> 00:31:22.881
What do you say?

462
00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:25.926
Why are you in a fucking bar

463
00:31:25.968 --> 00:31:27.636
if you're not gonna drink?

464
00:31:28.846 --> 00:31:31.849
Shut the hell up, Brooklyn.

465
00:31:32.349 --> 00:31:33.809
You're just a bartender, Larry.

466
00:31:33.851 --> 00:31:36.353
Know your fucking place.

467
00:31:36.645 --> 00:31:38.146
Brooklyn has a few drinks in her

468
00:31:38.188 --> 00:31:39.606
and she gets carried away.

469
00:31:39.648 --> 00:31:41.691
Pay no attention to her whatsoever.

470
00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.485
No, she's fine, she's fine.

471
00:31:44.236 --> 00:31:47.113
Hey, girl, hey, hey.

472
00:31:47.155 --> 00:31:50.909
Why don't you ditch the
stick and get with a chick?


473
00:31:56.456 --> 00:31:58.000
First time for that one.

474
00:31:58.834 --> 00:32:00.794
Larry, can I just, can we
get the check real quick, man?


475
00:32:00.836 --> 00:32:01.879
You got it.

476
00:32:03.672 --> 00:32:05.799
I hope she dumps your ass.

477
00:32:11.555 --> 00:32:14.766
Hey, there's this guy in the booth

478
00:32:15.893 --> 00:32:17.561
and he's just like staring at me.

479
00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.945
Hey, stop, what are you doing?

480
00:32:26.987 --> 00:32:28.154
- What?
- Stop it.


481
00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:29.906
- What?
- Hey, what are you gonna do,


482
00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:32.450
just punch a guy in the face
'cause he's looking at me?


483
00:32:32.492 --> 00:32:34.578
How many times are we gonna do this?

484
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.454
Seriously?

485
00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:38.206
- That's a good question.
- Hey.


486
00:32:38.248 --> 00:32:41.418
Hey, where the hell are you going, huh?

487
00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.377
Stop!

488
00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:53.388
What?

489
00:32:54.348 --> 00:32:55.974
Are you kidding me?

490
00:32:59.895 --> 00:33:00.938
Hey!

491
00:33:03.231 --> 00:33:04.524
What the fuck?

492
00:33:09.905 --> 00:33:13.075
What the fuck?

493
00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:23.376
Jules, I know you don't believe me,

494
00:33:23.418 --> 00:33:24.878
but I really was protecting you.

495
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.672
- Slow down.
- From what?


496
00:33:28.715 --> 00:33:29.841
I don't know.

497
00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.262
Okay.

498
00:33:35.806 --> 00:33:38.224
Well, at least you took me
for a walk, so thank you.


499
00:33:38.266 --> 00:33:40.602
Yeah, well, on a different route anyway.

500
00:33:41.853 --> 00:33:43.605
Where do you mean different route?

501
00:33:43.647 --> 00:33:45.065
What, what, what do you mean?

502
00:33:46.775 --> 00:33:48.110
Just forget it, okay?

503
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.279
As long as you and
I are cool, I'm good.

504
00:33:54.366 --> 00:33:55.951
Okay, well.

505
00:33:59.371 --> 00:34:00.956
- Okay?
- Yeah.


506
00:34:00.998 --> 00:34:02.040
- All right.
- Thank you


507
00:34:02.082 --> 00:34:03.166
for taking me here.

508
00:34:22.686 --> 00:34:24.771
Come on, you're super beautiful.

509
00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:26.940
- You are beautiful.
- I am?


510
00:34:26.982 --> 00:34:27.816
Yeah.

511
00:34:28.984 --> 00:34:30.944
Oh, I'm so sorry.

512
00:34:56.553 --> 00:34:58.138
Fuck.

513
00:34:58.180 --> 00:34:59.639
No, no, no, no.

514
00:35:00.307 --> 00:35:01.433
No, not again.

515
00:35:02.434 --> 00:35:03.560
Calm down, ray of sunshine.

516
00:35:03.602 --> 00:35:04.561
Whoa!

517
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:06.646
Don't fucking say that.

518
00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:07.981
Please don't fucking say that.

519
00:35:08.065 --> 00:35:09.024
Please, please, please, please.

520
00:35:09.232 --> 00:35:10.692
All I was gonna say was-

521
00:35:10.734 --> 00:35:12.277
Calm down, ray of sunshine,

522
00:35:12.319 --> 00:35:14.237
you must've done it outta habit.

523
00:35:14.613 --> 00:35:15.530
Bingo.

524
00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:18.616
Okay, look at us.

525
00:35:18.658 --> 00:35:19.868
No, no, no, don't look at us.

526
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.328
Do you know that you've
said that to me three times?


527
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.997
Three fucking times.

528
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.374
Third time for what?

529
00:35:26.416 --> 00:35:29.795
- You're scaring me.
- Oh, yeah, you're scared?


530
00:35:32.839 --> 00:35:35.175
It's Gene, everything
all right in there?


531
00:35:35.217 --> 00:35:36.218
Right on cue.

532
00:35:36.301 --> 00:35:37.677
Yeah, everything's fine in here, Gene.

533
00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:39.220
Sorry.

534
00:35:39.262 --> 00:35:41.347
Everything's not fine, Gene.

535
00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:42.557
How about you fuck off.

536
00:35:48.605 --> 00:35:52.567
Bobby, third time for what?

537
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:53.985
We've done this twice before,

538
00:35:54.027 --> 00:35:56.112
and this is the third
time we've done this.


539
00:35:56.154 --> 00:35:58.865
Every morning we wake
up at 6:45 in the a.m.,


540
00:35:58.907 --> 00:36:00.909
and we say the same shit.

541
00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:02.744
We do the same shit.

542
00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.581
And then we go
about our day and then...

543
00:36:08.083 --> 00:36:09.126
And then what?

544
00:36:17.717 --> 00:36:19.386
Then something happens to you.

545
00:36:21.263 --> 00:36:22.639
What happens to me?

546
00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:28.186
I don't wanna talk about it.

547
00:36:30.772 --> 00:36:32.023
You had a bad dream, that's all.

548
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.777
Okay, yeah, bad dream.

549
00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:36.945
That's what it is.

550
00:36:40.115 --> 00:36:43.993
Okay, you had, you had a terrible dream.

551
00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:45.745
That's a better word.

552
00:36:45.787 --> 00:36:46.704
Yep.

553
00:36:46.746 --> 00:36:48.832
Yeah, but let's be realistic here.

554
00:36:49.499 --> 00:36:51.334
All right, this could be from anything.

555
00:36:51.376 --> 00:36:53.420
You've been stressed out lately.

556
00:36:53.795 --> 00:36:55.172
We've been fighting.

557
00:36:55.839 --> 00:36:57.716
You have no idea, okay?

558
00:36:58.508 --> 00:37:01.595
Everything it feels so.

559
00:37:04.723 --> 00:37:05.849
You're gonna be okay.

560
00:37:05.891 --> 00:37:08.143
How many times have you
woken up from a dream


561
00:37:08.185 --> 00:37:11.354
sad or happy or scared?

562
00:37:11.396 --> 00:37:13.231
Right, right?

563
00:37:16.026 --> 00:37:16.901
You got me, Jules.

564
00:37:16.943 --> 00:37:18.320
How many fuckin' times?

565
00:37:18.695 --> 00:37:19.904
Why don't you just calm down

566
00:37:19.946 --> 00:37:21.865
and we'll go get some fresh air.

567
00:37:22.407 --> 00:37:23.325
Okay?

568
00:37:23.825 --> 00:37:26.912
- Just go shower.
- Mm hm.


569
00:37:27.537 --> 00:37:30.999
I'm gonna call my mom
and let her know I'm alive.


570
00:37:33.043 --> 00:37:34.961
Should I tell her you said hi?

571
00:37:35.003 --> 00:37:36.338
Yeah, sure.

572
00:37:55.982 --> 00:37:57.067
Okay.

573
00:38:02.697 --> 00:38:03.990
What the fuck?

574
00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:10.247
Okay.

575
00:38:11.498 --> 00:38:12.415
Okay.

576
00:38:25.804 --> 00:38:27.472
Oh, hey, morning.

577
00:38:27.514 --> 00:38:28.598
Sorry about the bathroom.

578
00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.892
I'll have Shelly tidy up in there later.

579
00:38:30.934 --> 00:38:31.851
Will you?

580
00:38:31.893 --> 00:38:33.186
Yeah, where is Shelly?

581
00:38:33.228 --> 00:38:34.229
Is she sleeping in?

582
00:38:34.271 --> 00:38:35.813
No, she's here, she's working.

583
00:38:35.855 --> 00:38:38.858
Okay, now that I got
you here in front of us


584
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.736
instead of knocking on our
door which you love to do,


585
00:38:42.028 --> 00:38:43.404
we pay good money, right, right?

586
00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:45.240
Can I assume that I'm not gonna

587
00:38:45.282 --> 00:38:46.783
have to shave the fuckin' soap tomorrow?

588
00:38:46.825 --> 00:38:48.368
- Bobby.
- Shave the soap?


589
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:50.203
What are you talkin'
about shaving the soap?


590
00:38:50.245 --> 00:38:52.205
There was a hair on it this big.

591
00:38:52.289 --> 00:38:53.498
- Really?
- Yeah.


592
00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.875
Well, I'll have Shelly take care of it.

593
00:38:55.917 --> 00:38:56.751
That sounds great.

594
00:38:56.793 --> 00:38:58.086
This Shelly person, who is she?

595
00:38:58.128 --> 00:38:59.087
I've not seen her.

596
00:38:59.129 --> 00:39:00.546
- Have you seen her?
- Stop it, stop it.


597
00:39:00.588 --> 00:39:02.257
Hm, yeah?

598
00:39:02.299 --> 00:39:06.135
Gene, not having a very
good time as you can see.


599
00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:07.637
I assume the ferries are running

600
00:39:07.887 --> 00:39:09.472
so we can get the fuck outta here?

601
00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:15.645
Bobby, Bobby, how many
times I gotta tell you


602
00:39:15.854 --> 00:39:17.897
there's no ferry service this weekend.

603
00:39:19.024 --> 00:39:21.985
You can't get off the island, all right?

604
00:39:22.444 --> 00:39:25.613
But I will get Shelly for you.

605
00:39:25.655 --> 00:39:27.073
She's down in the laundry room.

606
00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:28.324
We'll take care of the bathroom.

607
00:39:28.366 --> 00:39:29.367
- She is?
- Yeah.


608
00:39:29.409 --> 00:39:31.035
Okay, great.

609
00:39:31.077 --> 00:39:32.162
That sounds awesome.

610
00:39:32.829 --> 00:39:33.997
Thanks, Gene.

611
00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:36.624
- You're welcome.
- What?


612
00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:39.002
You know, this stopped
being fun about an hour ago.


613
00:39:39.044 --> 00:39:42.130
Mm mm, this stopped being fun yesterday

614
00:39:42.172 --> 00:39:43.172
when I did it for the second time.

615
00:39:43.214 --> 00:39:44.591
I told you that.

616
00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:47.552
Why are you being such an asshole?

617
00:39:48.845 --> 00:39:52.891
Hey, I'm trying to save you.

618
00:39:53.016 --> 00:39:55.351
- That's all.
- Save me from what, Bobby?


619
00:39:55.393 --> 00:39:56.144
I am fine.

620
00:39:56.186 --> 00:39:56.936
Everything is fine.

621
00:39:56.978 --> 00:39:58.271
I don't know what you
think happened to me.


622
00:39:58.313 --> 00:40:00.565
Honestly, I have no idea.

623
00:40:03.651 --> 00:40:04.736
Okay.

624
00:40:06.446 --> 00:40:09.699
His is gonna sound fuckin' crazy, I know.

625
00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:12.202
But you...

626
00:40:15.705 --> 00:40:16.915
Bobby,

627
00:40:20.752 --> 00:40:21.419
what?

628
00:40:21.461 --> 00:40:22.795
Forgot something,
I'll be right back okay?


629
00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:23.629
- Are you serious?
- I'm sorry.


630
00:40:23.671 --> 00:40:24.881
No, I'm sorry.

631
00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:26.007
- I'll be right back.
- Don't touch me.


632
00:40:26.049 --> 00:40:27.467
I apologize, my bad.

633
00:40:30.136 --> 00:40:31.888
Hey, Shelly.

634
00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.098
Don't worry,
I'm gonna get the bathroom


635
00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.725
cleaned for you right now.

636
00:40:36.101 --> 00:40:38.394
Look at that, who's the lucky guy?

637
00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:39.896
Give me a break.

638
00:40:39.938 --> 00:40:41.397
What do you want?

639
00:40:41.439 --> 00:40:43.358
I've got a question to ask.

640
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.234
I got a lotta rooms to do.

641
00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.486
What is it?

642
00:40:46.528 --> 00:40:48.363
Gene was talking about a story,

643
00:40:48.405 --> 00:40:51.324
a couple that got murdered a while back.

644
00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:53.243
What happened, who were they?

645
00:40:54.536 --> 00:40:57.497
Lovers on vacation as far as I know.

646
00:40:59.666 --> 00:41:03.253
Sally, there
is a hair on this soap!


647
00:41:04.212 --> 00:41:06.339
You know what you need to do, Bobby.

648
00:41:07.674 --> 00:41:09.175
How do you know my name?

649
00:41:10.009 --> 00:41:11.636
Just do the right thing.

650
00:41:12.011 --> 00:41:13.596
It's all you gotta do.

651
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:16.724
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what
the hell does that mean?


652
00:41:19.769 --> 00:41:21.479
Don't touch me.

653
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.983
Hey, what the hell does that mean?

654
00:41:25.608 --> 00:41:29.654
Don't touch me.

655
00:41:42.292 --> 00:41:43.918
- Have you been drinking?
- What?


656
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:45.420
Is that, are you serious?

657
00:41:45.462 --> 00:41:46.421
- Come on.
- Well, you're looking


658
00:41:46.463 --> 00:41:48.256
around like a crazy maniac.

659
00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.105
- Thank you.
- Oh, thanks.


660
00:42:47.482 --> 00:42:48.733
No way.

661
00:42:52.612 --> 00:42:54.197
Marry me, Jules.

662
00:42:55.198 --> 00:42:56.824
We were just fighting.

663
00:42:57.492 --> 00:42:59.577
I don't understand, what, how?

664
00:42:59.619 --> 00:43:01.246
None of that matters.

665
00:43:08.962 --> 00:43:10.463
I love you so much.

666
00:43:13.091 --> 00:43:14.425
I love you.

667
00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:22.183
I am right here, Jules,
the whole time okay?


668
00:43:27.772 --> 00:43:28.773
Hey.

669
00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:33.569
I know just how good the odds

670
00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:35.029
are that this is gonna go bad.

671
00:43:35.071 --> 00:43:36.531
Jules is different, Cassi, I'm serious.

672
00:43:36.573 --> 00:43:39.575
Uh, she may be different, but you?

673
00:43:39.617 --> 00:43:41.536
Mm mm, nope.

674
00:43:41.744 --> 00:43:43.162
She doesn't even know who you are.

675
00:43:43.204 --> 00:43:44.413
- Yeah?
- Not really.


676
00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:46.249
How long have we known each other, huh?

677
00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:50.253
I think the heart wants
what the heart wants.


678
00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:51.629
- You didn't just say that.
- Yes, I did.


679
00:43:51.671 --> 00:43:54.840
Don't even try that
Dr. Phil crap with me.


680
00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:56.301
Like...

681
00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:58.094
She's wrong for you.

682
00:43:58.136 --> 00:44:00.972
She's a nice girl,
but a dog's gotta hunt.

683
00:44:01.055 --> 00:44:05.726
And we both know, 
Bobby Patterson was, is,

684
00:44:05.768 --> 00:44:08.855
and will always be a pure bred canine.

685
00:44:10.189 --> 00:44:12.233
What's the one that was
up here from Florida?


686
00:44:12.275 --> 00:44:14.193
- With the internship.
- Yeah are, yeah, okay.


687
00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:15.611
- That was Alexi and I was-
- And?


688
00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:16.779
Just welcoming her to our city.

689
00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:19.824
You were just welcoming her
to fuck you for a few months.


690
00:44:19.866 --> 00:44:21.826
And the waitress in Tribeca?

691
00:44:22.827 --> 00:44:25.204
That was, that was Sarah.

692
00:44:25.246 --> 00:44:28.791
Soup, the girl smelled like soup.

693
00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:30.251
Delicious soup.

694
00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:32.461
You starting to see
where I'm going with this?


695
00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.088
- Maybe a little.
- Yeah, yeah.


696
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:36.215
Listen to Cassi, she's nothing but classy.

697
00:44:36.549 --> 00:44:38.092
- You are.
- This is true.


698
00:44:38.134 --> 00:44:39.594
You've always had my back, I know that.

699
00:44:39.636 --> 00:44:41.429
It's about being true to yourself.

700
00:44:41.721 --> 00:44:43.764
That is some Dr. 
Phil shit right there.

701
00:44:43.806 --> 00:44:44.807
You know what?

702
00:44:44.849 --> 00:44:46.183
- Fuck you, Bobby.
- Fuck you?


703
00:44:46.225 --> 00:44:48.144
And that ship sailed a long time ago.

704
00:44:48.186 --> 00:44:49.562
- Very long ago.
- Nice try.


705
00:44:49.604 --> 00:44:51.230
Very,.

706
00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:54.942
I wish this day could last forever.

707
00:45:19.217 --> 00:45:20.968
That's really what you wanna do?

708
00:45:22.387 --> 00:45:23.471
Why not?

709
00:45:24.931 --> 00:45:26.766
You wanna stay in the room all day?

710
00:45:27.975 --> 00:45:28.684
Are you kidding me?

711
00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:31.354
Who wouldn't wanna spend
all day in a room with you?


712
00:45:32.271 --> 00:45:33.564
Cute, you're cute.

713
00:45:33.606 --> 00:45:35.983
Mm hm.

714
00:45:37.694 --> 00:45:40.697
Hm, I don't know, let's think about it.

715
00:45:41.531 --> 00:45:45.284
How often do we get to
spend all day in a cozy bed


716
00:45:45.827 --> 00:45:49.372
in this cozy nook, giving
massages and making love all day.


717
00:45:49.414 --> 00:45:52.709
- I don't know.
- Yeah?


718
00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.671
Okay, but shouldn't we, I don't know.

719
00:45:57.755 --> 00:45:59.716
Go sightseeing or something?

720
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:02.385
Oh, I've got my sights right here.

721
00:46:03.678 --> 00:46:05.930
That's a good one.

722
00:46:05.972 --> 00:46:07.264
That was bad I think, oh yes.

723
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.018
It's Gene.

724
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.062
Gene, yeah, we're good in here, buddy.

725
00:46:14.021 --> 00:46:15.648
Everything all right in there?

726
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:16.858
Yeah, yeah.

727
00:46:18.151 --> 00:46:19.402
What is he doing?

728
00:46:26.242 --> 00:46:28.744
Hey, Gene, yeah, we're fine.

729
00:46:28.786 --> 00:46:30.538
I think we're gonna stay in today.

730
00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:32.457
- You are?
- Yeah.


731
00:46:33.207 --> 00:46:34.875
Would you mind bringing up some lunch

732
00:46:34.917 --> 00:46:37.670
and maybe some of those
board games you mentioned?


733
00:46:37.712 --> 00:46:39.922
Since you asked so politely.

734
00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:47.179
So, I asked Gene to bring up

735
00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:49.557
some lunch and board games for us.

736
00:46:49.599 --> 00:46:51.058
What do you think?

737
00:46:51.392 --> 00:46:52.351
Hm?

738
00:46:52.894 --> 00:46:54.061
- Keep going.
- Keep going?


739
00:46:54.103 --> 00:46:55.521
- Mm hm.
- Okay.


740
00:46:56.898 --> 00:46:57.940
- I'll keep going.
- Mm hm.


741
00:46:57.982 --> 00:47:00.276
Oh, my God, Bobby.

742
00:47:00.359 --> 00:47:01.944
Not so rough, sheesh.

743
00:47:01.986 --> 00:47:03.029
Sorry.

744
00:47:06.699 --> 00:47:09.744
Hey, I love you.

745
00:47:10.244 --> 00:47:11.454
I love you.

746
00:47:42.443 --> 00:47:45.363
Oh, that was a quick one.

747
00:47:46.405 --> 00:47:48.324
- Mm.
- Okay, teach me how to play.


748
00:47:48.366 --> 00:47:50.243
- Okay.
- What's my first move?


749
00:47:51.327 --> 00:47:53.954
- This-
- Uh huh, is?


750
00:47:53.996 --> 00:47:55.831
- This is a pawn.
- Is a pawn.


751
00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:59.001
Mm hm, it's a very important piece.

752
00:48:13.474 --> 00:48:14.809
"The black cat.

753
00:48:15.768 --> 00:48:17.603
For the most yet wildly homely narrative

754
00:48:17.645 --> 00:48:22.942
which I'm about to pen, I
neither expect nor solicit belief


755
00:48:23.401 --> 00:48:27.988
in which case where my senses
reject their own evidence.


756
00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.950
Mad I am not, very
surely do I not dream.

757
00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:35.120
Before I die, today I
would unburthen my soul.


758
00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:41.794
Would unburthen my soul
my immediate purpose."


759
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:55.683
Hey, baby.

760
00:48:56.225 --> 00:48:57.184
Hey.

761
00:50:14.345 --> 00:50:15.763
I really love this day.

762
00:50:17.348 --> 00:50:19.433
I wish it could last forever.

763
00:50:56.262 --> 00:50:57.722
Jesus Christ.

764
00:51:04.812 --> 00:51:05.980
What's up?

765
00:51:06.981 --> 00:51:10.901
I'm gonna take these
dishes outside for Gene.


766
00:51:10.943 --> 00:51:14.196
Well, just put 'em in
the sink right there.


767
00:51:14.238 --> 00:51:16.615
Then it's gonna stink all
night and that would suck.


768
00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:17.783
- Right?
- Okay.


769
00:51:17.825 --> 00:51:19.243
Why don't you just leave 'em?

770
00:51:19.285 --> 00:51:20.911
Open the door and just pop 'em
right on the floor for Gene,


771
00:51:20.953 --> 00:51:22.246
and he'll pick 'em up.

772
00:51:22.288 --> 00:51:23.956
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

773
00:51:23.998 --> 00:51:25.082
Okay.

774
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:27.418
What?

775
00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.503
I just, that's what I'm doing, baby.

776
00:51:29.545 --> 00:51:30.796
- Okay.
- Yeah.


777
00:52:09.085 --> 00:52:10.294
Hey, Gene.

778
00:52:10.711 --> 00:52:11.837
Thanks!

779
00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.133
A real son of a bitch!

780
00:52:18.177 --> 00:52:19.845
I think I pissed him off.

781
00:52:20.221 --> 00:52:21.680
- Oh, yeah?
- 100% pissed him off.


782
00:52:21.722 --> 00:52:23.015
- 100%?
- Yes.


783
00:52:29.021 --> 00:52:31.315
Hey, I'm gonna shower.

784
00:52:31.899 --> 00:52:32.900
- Okay.
- Yeah.


785
00:52:32.942 --> 00:52:34.443
- Can I join you?
- No, you stay right here.


786
00:52:34.485 --> 00:52:35.652
I got you right where I want you.

787
00:52:35.694 --> 00:52:37.613
- Oh, really?
- Yep, yep.


788
00:52:37.655 --> 00:52:38.697
- I'm showering.
- Well, that's interesting.


789
00:52:38.739 --> 00:52:39.740
- You are?
- Mm hm.


790
00:52:39.782 --> 00:52:40.699
Huh, okay.

791
00:52:40.741 --> 00:52:42.284
You can sleep on that
bed out there, all right?


792
00:52:42.326 --> 00:52:43.202
Okay.

793
00:52:43.494 --> 00:52:45.913
- Sleep tight.
- Okay, I'm taking a shower.


794
00:52:45.955 --> 00:52:46.955
Mm hm, enjoy.

795
00:52:46.997 --> 00:52:48.249
All right.

796
00:52:58.175 --> 00:52:59.343
Holy shit.

797
00:53:00.845 --> 00:53:02.138
We did it.

798
00:53:17.319 --> 00:53:18.112
Jules?

799
00:53:19.446 --> 00:53:20.865
You can open up.

800
00:53:27.496 --> 00:53:29.498
What's the magic word?

801
00:53:29.915 --> 00:53:32.960
Um, multiple orgasms.

802
00:53:33.002 --> 00:53:35.003
That's two words.

803
00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:37.339
Okay, no, come on, seriously.

804
00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:38.424
Let me in.

805
00:53:38.716 --> 00:53:40.885
Come on, you have three seconds.

806
00:53:42.553 --> 00:53:49.017
Three, two, one!

807
00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:22.926
I wish this day would last forever.

808
00:54:22.968 --> 00:54:24.761
I wish this day would
last forever, forever,


809
00:54:24.803 --> 00:54:27.056
forever, forever, forever.

810
00:55:10.766 --> 00:55:12.351
You really love me, huh?

811
00:55:23.612 --> 00:55:25.447
You think I look British?

812
00:55:29.868 --> 00:55:32.329
Bobby, not so rough, sheesh.

813
00:55:37.001 --> 00:55:39.086
What's this, "To Bobby?"

814
00:55:40.713 --> 00:55:42.506
I wrote you a letter.

815
00:55:42.548 --> 00:55:45.551
- When'd you do that?
- When we were fighting.


816
00:55:46.093 --> 00:55:47.177
In case I forgot all the terrible,

817
00:55:47.219 --> 00:55:49.471
terrible things I wanted to say to you.

818
00:55:50.931 --> 00:55:52.433
I really love this day.

819
00:55:54.268 --> 00:55:56.312
You know what
you need to do, Bobby.


820
00:55:56.854 --> 00:55:58.397
Just do the right thing.

821
00:56:02.568 --> 00:56:04.194
But we were just fighting.

822
00:56:11.035 --> 00:56:12.494
Don't touch me.

823
00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:21.962
I'm trying to piece this all together

824
00:56:22.004 --> 00:56:23.505
and explain it to you.

825
00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:26.550
That's bullshit.

826
00:56:28.635 --> 00:56:29.845
I can prove it.

827
00:57:20.312 --> 00:57:22.398
I'm really starting to like this island.

828
00:57:22.689 --> 00:57:24.525
- You are?
- Mm hm, yeah.


829
00:57:25.567 --> 00:57:26.401
- Good.
- I don't know,


830
00:57:26.443 --> 00:57:27.694
with everything going on.

831
00:57:29.405 --> 00:57:31.198
Yeah?

832
00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:33.409
This is a really nice day with you.

833
00:57:35.661 --> 00:57:37.204
I wish it could last forever.

834
00:57:39.706 --> 00:57:40.666
I do.

835
00:57:44.253 --> 00:57:46.546
Bobby, what's up?

836
00:57:46.588 --> 00:57:49.091
- Hey.
- What the fuck?


837
00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:52.928
What are you doing, Bobby?

838
00:57:54.012 --> 00:57:55.222
Bobby!

839
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:58.016
Oh, my God.

840
00:58:15.534 --> 00:58:16.577
Bobby!

841
00:58:19.246 --> 00:58:20.664
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey!


842
00:58:22.875 --> 00:58:24.376
- What the hell, man?
- Oh shit.


843
00:58:24.418 --> 00:58:26.169
- What do you want?
- Shit, I'm sorry, man.


844
00:58:26.211 --> 00:58:27.254
I am...

845
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:31.300
Seriously, this is not funny anymore.

846
00:59:14.426 --> 00:59:16.845
Calm down, ray of sunshine.

847
00:59:16.887 --> 00:59:19.056
You must've done it by habit.

848
00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:26.605
You're silly.

849
01:00:00.389 --> 01:00:02.933
You're trying to get reception here now?

850
01:00:02.975 --> 01:00:05.561
We don't get reception here.

851
01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:09.648
Um, I'm gonna call my mom
and see if I can get through


852
01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:10.607
to her outside, okay?

853
01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:11.900
- Yeah.
- Okay.


854
01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.617
That's a nice
looking girl you got there.


855
01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:23.161
Appreciate it, Larry.

856
01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:02.451
Okay, guys.

857
01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:04.077
And if you need
anything else let me know.

858
01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:05.787
- My name's Pearl.
- Thank you, Pearl.


859
01:01:07.998 --> 01:01:10.917
That's a nice
looking girl you got there.


860
01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:12.878
Appreciate it, Larry.

861
01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.710
Hey, genius.

862
01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.754
It's a toy gun.

863
01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.632
Can't you feel the weight?

864
01:01:58.674 --> 01:02:00.842
What are you horse's ass or what?

865
01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:04.221
Shut the fuck up.

866
01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.848
Damn, he's crazy.

867
01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:10.811
Okay, guys.

868
01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:12.228
And if you need
anything else let me know.

869
01:02:12.270 --> 01:02:13.897
- My name's Pearl.
- Thank you, Pearl.


870
01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:19.152
All right, say it.

871
01:02:19.778 --> 01:02:20.654
Come on.

872
01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:23.865
Go ahead and say it, Brooklyn.

873
01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:26.159
I hope she dumps your ass.

874
01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:36.294
- You shut the fuck-
- What the fuck?


875
01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:38.421
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Shut the fuck up, Brooklyn!


876
01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:40.340
Yo, leave that bitch alone.

877
01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:57.232
I thought you said no fighting?

878
01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:58.608
I don't know what to tell you.

879
01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:01.152
You assaulted two people
and you broke his nose.


880
01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:02.529
Yeah, he probably had
it coming to him anyway.


881
01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:03.488
- Really, Bobby?
- Yeah.


882
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:04.531
Look where you are right now.

883
01:03:04.573 --> 01:03:05.657
Where I am?

884
01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:07.909
Well, to me, this looks
like somewhere safe.


885
01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:10.328
God.

886
01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:12.289
You two having fun in our little town?

887
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.749
Oh, yeah.

888
01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:16.376
Time of our fuckin' lives.

889
01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:18.253
Are the cuffs necessary, sir?

890
01:03:18.587 --> 01:03:20.964
Your boyfriend just
punched a local in the face.


891
01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:23.008
So, yeah, cuffs.

892
01:03:25.719 --> 01:03:28.722
But you're in luck, Mark's
not gonna press charges.


893
01:03:28.764 --> 01:03:30.515
If it was up
to me, you'd be spending

894
01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:32.476
a very long time on our island.

895
01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:35.687
Still, Mark and Brooklyn
are friends of mine.


896
01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:38.106
So, you're gonna sit tight
while we process you out.


897
01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.567
You can ponder that for
a few hours, tough guy.


898
01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:42.319
- All right.
- Have a nice night, ma'am.


899
01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:44.154
Yeah, okay.

900
01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:46.782
All right, yeah.

901
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.451
- I'll be here.
- Great, well...


902
01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.037
- What?
- Okay.


903
01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.458
Enjoy yourself in there.

904
01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:57.459
I'll bake you a cake.

905
01:03:57.542 --> 01:03:58.293
Appreciate it and you know what?

906
01:03:58.335 --> 01:03:59.628
I'll be right here.

907
01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:02.338
I didn't ask to be bailed out.

908
01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.923
Look, you've been acting
like a complete psycho


909
01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:05.509
- all day long.
- I'm trying...


910
01:04:05.592 --> 01:04:06.509
You know the Bobby that made me

911
01:04:06.551 --> 01:04:07.343
not wanna come in the first place?

912
01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:08.887
- Yeah, that Bobby.
- Please, come on-


913
01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:10.180
Why did you bring me
here in the first place


914
01:04:10.222 --> 01:04:11.556
if you're gonna act like this?

915
01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.017
I am trying to figure that out myself.

916
01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.018
Hey, good job, bravo.

917
01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.853
Because I wanted to spend
all day in prison with you.


918
01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:18.188
That's what I wanted to do.

919
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:22.150
Really, you're acting like
a fucking mental patient!


920
01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.109
Why?

921
01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:25.528
What are you trying to
save me from, Bobby?


922
01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.030
Listen, you don't understand.

923
01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:28.073
You don't.

924
01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:30.158
You know what, that's the first thing

925
01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.702
you've said all day that
makes complete sense.


926
01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:35.997
You're right, I don't understand
you and I don't want to.


927
01:04:36.665 --> 01:04:37.749
Jules, come on.

928
01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.210
Listen, I just need you to trust me.

929
01:04:40.252 --> 01:04:41.503
Please, trust me.

930
01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:46.299
Please.

931
01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.219
I don't trust you.

932
01:05:05.902 --> 01:05:07.112
No!

933
01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:01.916
Hey, I'm gonna grab a coffee.

934
01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:04.753
- You want one?
- Yes, please.


935
01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:06.713
Yes, please.

936
01:06:08.757 --> 01:06:10.967
Mm, I don't have any service here.

937
01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:12.802
Oh, that's a good thing.

938
01:06:12.928 --> 01:06:14.262
I was just trying to call my mom

939
01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:15.305
and let her know we're alive.

940
01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:17.349
Well, good luck with that.

941
01:06:17.515 --> 01:06:19.225
Uh huh, should I
tell her you said hi?

942
01:06:19.267 --> 01:06:20.602
Mm hm.

943
01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:42.624
Okay, mother, I'm calling.

944
01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:03.853
Hi, Mom.

945
01:07:04.104 --> 01:07:05.647
Yeah, sorry.

946
01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.398
There's barely...

947
01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.235
No, no, I know, there's barely
any service on this island.


948
01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:12.028
No, no, I understand.

949
01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:13.821
No, I'm good, we're good.

950
01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.031
Everything's great.

951
01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:17.575
Oh, no, it's beautiful here.

952
01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:20.787
Yeah, he's good.

953
01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:23.206
Uh huh.

954
01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:25.000
Mom, I can't hear you.

955
01:07:26.001 --> 01:07:27.794
What did you, Mom?

956
01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:32.632
Hey, Larry?

957
01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:38.638
Would you mind if I bend
your ear for a minute?


958
01:07:40.015 --> 01:07:41.349
I am a bartender.

959
01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.184
It's not exactly unusual.

960
01:07:44.853 --> 01:07:47.063
Well, you know
my girl, Jules, right?


961
01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:48.982
About as well as I know you.

962
01:07:49.441 --> 01:07:52.944
Okay, well,
recently we had a fight,


963
01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:56.281
and it was one of those
fights that never ends.


964
01:07:57.490 --> 01:07:59.451
- Unfinished.
- How bad?


965
01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:03.079
It's bad, real bad.

966
01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:06.916
She accused me of something
and what she accused me of,


967
01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:11.421
well, she was right.

968
01:08:12.714 --> 01:08:13.798
And?

969
01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:15.925
I never fessed up to it.

970
01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:19.512
So, you're asking me advice about women?

971
01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:21.222
Yeah.

972
01:08:21.347 --> 01:08:23.307
Having been married four times,

973
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:25.768
I'm not exactly an
authority on the subject.


974
01:08:25.810 --> 01:08:29.397
I'm not particularly good at it,

975
01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:33.985
but one thing I can tell you
is that when it comes to women,


976
01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:36.362
honestly is not the best policy.

977
01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:40.033
It's the only policy.

978
01:08:40.492 --> 01:08:41.701
Is that right?

979
01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:44.162
And as Shakespeare would say,

980
01:08:44.204 --> 01:08:46.122
"The truth will come to light."

981
01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:51.419
Yeah, but what
if this truth entails me


982
01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.004
fucking her best friend?

983
01:08:53.088 --> 01:08:55.673
- You fucked her best friend?
- Yes, I did.


984
01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:57.967
And it knocked her up.

985
01:08:58.009 --> 01:09:00.219
You fucked her best friend
and you made her pregnant?


986
01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.263
Yes, I did and
took her to the clinic.


987
01:09:02.847 --> 01:09:03.807
Wow.

988
01:09:05.391 --> 01:09:06.476
Yeah.

989
01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:11.022
We, hey, we went to the clinic
together and everything.


990
01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:14.734
Well, then, Bobby, 
I guess we both know

991
01:09:14.776 --> 01:09:16.528
what you have to do.

992
01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:08.872
- Stop, stop pouring please.
- What?


993
01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:09.873
What you doing, Bobby?

994
01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:11.040
What does it look like I'm doing?

995
01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:12.458
Having drinks, getting lit.

996
01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:14.627
Is this a joke?

997
01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:16.212
You bet it's a joke.

998
01:10:16.337 --> 01:10:18.047
It's one big fuckin' joke.

999
01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:21.593
And I'm the fuckin' punch line.

1000
01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:24.011
But at least this time, thank
you, Larry, you're a good man.


1001
01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:26.681
And this time it
ain't gonna hurt as much.

1002
01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:28.850
It's good stuff.

1003
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:30.310
Want some?

1004
01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:31.728
You gonna have one with me?

1005
01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.564
Hm, what?

1006
01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:38.318
It's a fuckin' joke.

1007
01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:41.487
Stop, you gonna have one with me?

1008
01:10:42.947 --> 01:10:44.782
Yeah, I could use one.

1009
01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:49.120
Woo, where you goin'?

1010
01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:51.122
You ain't gonna catch that ferry today.

1011
01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:52.206
- I'm just ea yin'.
- Oh, hello.


1012
01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:55.168
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay.


1013
01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.419
That's different.

1014
01:10:56.461 --> 01:10:57.212
Like that?

1015
01:10:57.337 --> 01:10:58.796
- Enjoy, Bobby.
- Okay.


1016
01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.677
Hey, look, you're not
gonna get off the island.


1017
01:11:04.719 --> 01:11:05.553
There's no point anyway.

1018
01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:07.597
Hey, hey!

1019
01:11:09.224 --> 01:11:10.975
Hey, fuck you, Brooklyn.

1020
01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:13.603
You're a waste of space.

1021
01:11:44.884 --> 01:11:46.135
You're just gonna keep
on doing this, aren't you?


1022
01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:47.720
You're just gonna keep on doing this, huh?

1023
01:11:47.762 --> 01:11:48.346
Huh, Bobby?

1024
01:11:48.388 --> 01:11:50.556
Look at me, focus and look at me!

1025
01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:53.476
Listen to me!

1026
01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:55.061
Because this girlfriend
doesn't love you, right?


1027
01:11:55.103 --> 01:11:56.687
Because I don't love you?

1028
01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:59.398
Are you seriously not going
to look at me right now?


1029
01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.859
Look at me in the face, Bobby!

1030
01:12:02.694 --> 01:12:04.737
How many times are you
gonna do this to me?


1031
01:12:04.821 --> 01:12:07.323
Listen to me, Bobby, listen to me.

1032
01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:10.535
I'm right here!

1033
01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:12.995
I'm trying to talk to you, Bobby.

1034
01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:15.289
You need to stop fucking drinking

1035
01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:17.458
because I love you and I care!

1036
01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:20.211
You need to stop drinking
and you need to love me!


1037
01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:21.128
Really?

1038
01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.922
Okay, walk away, Bobby.

1039
01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:24.465
Bobby!

1040
01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:34.142
Bobby!

1041
01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:53.512
Okay, guys, here you go.

1042
01:13:53.554 --> 01:13:54.847
And if you need anything
else, let me know.


1043
01:13:54.889 --> 01:13:55.806
My name's Pearl.

1044
01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:58.142
I hope she dumps your ass.

1045
01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:00.394
You've lost
your very soul, Bobby.


1046
01:14:00.436 --> 01:14:01.479
You gotta tell her the truth.

1047
01:14:01.521 --> 01:14:03.522
If you care about the
girl, you gotta let her go.


1048
01:14:03.564 --> 01:14:05.066
You know what
you need to do, Bobby.


1049
01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:06.776
Set her free, man.

1050
01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:08.611
- Hey.
- Hm?


1051
01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:14.700
I'm gonna tell you something.

1052
01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:22.875
Hi.

1053
01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:26.003
I have a few things I
wanna talk to you about.


1054
01:14:26.671 --> 01:14:28.172
- Okay.
- Okay.


1055
01:14:28.756 --> 01:14:31.759
Um, we've been spending
a lot of time together,


1056
01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:34.178
and I know that I've done some
stupid shit and fucked up.


1057
01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:35.221
It's been a long time and
this is the hardest thing-


1058
01:14:35.263 --> 01:14:36.889
Understand that I'm telling you this only

1059
01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:39.392
because of how much I
love you and I fucked up.


1060
01:14:39.434 --> 01:14:40.768
I can't keep you in a cage.

1061
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:42.103
I've done some stupid shit.

1062
01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.313
Ever had to tell anyone.

1063
01:14:44.564 --> 01:14:45.898
I fucked up.

1064
01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:53.948
Before Ashley, there was this other girl.

1065
01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.700
Bobby.

1066
01:15:00.872 --> 01:15:02.915
Come back to bed, baby.

1067
01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:07.962
There was this other girl.

1068
01:18:06.974 --> 01:18:08.768
This time I did it.

1069
01:18:13.314 --> 01:18:14.482
I did it.

1070
01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:25.052
Robert Patterson,
you're under arrest


1071
01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:27.722
for the murder of Juliet Rable.

1072
01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:45.030
Ball's in your court, kid.

1073
01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:47.116
Look, I don't know what
you guys want me to tell you


1074
01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:50.035
that I haven't fucking
said 15 times already.


1075
01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:51.328
The truth works.

1076
01:19:51.412 --> 01:19:54.081
'Cause right now you're
looking at the death penalty.


1077
01:19:55.207 --> 01:19:57.251
Look, Robert, I told you in the lobby.

1078
01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:01.004
You're under arrest for
the murder of Juliet Rable.


1079
01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:02.214
Now, if you'd done this in Philly,

1080
01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:03.757
you'd only be looking at life.

1081
01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:06.886
- Dumbass.
- This is fuckin' ridiculous.


1082
01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:08.554
I just spoke with her.

1083
01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:10.097
Just spoke to her?

1084
01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:12.558
We got real good acting here, huh, Tony?

1085
01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:14.309
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.


1086
01:20:14.351 --> 01:20:15.227
I don't know.

1087
01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:16.645
Robert, we know what you did.

1088
01:20:16.687 --> 01:20:18.230
We just wanna hear it from you.

1089
01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.024
I love the fucking girl.

1090
01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:22.401
Why would I kill her?

1091
01:20:24.403 --> 01:20:25.988
Ashley Myers.

1092
01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:28.282
She was Juliet's best friend.

1093
01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.411
I don't know that girl.

1094
01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:35.790
Girl had your abortion.

1095
01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:37.708
Now you don't know the girl?

1096
01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:39.918
You got a fucking cold heart, man.

1097
01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:41.211
No, no, no, you guys
are making a mistake.


1098
01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:43.130
Jules isn't dead, okay?

1099
01:20:44.048 --> 01:20:45.883
If that's the case, fuckhead,

1100
01:20:45.925 --> 01:20:47.718
then what the hell are we looking at?

1101
01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:50.012
'Cause that sure looks
like a dead person to me.


1102
01:20:55.768 --> 01:20:57.352
This is a mistake, okay?

1103
01:20:57.394 --> 01:20:59.313
I was just on vacation with her.

1104
01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:02.399
Bobby, I don't know who
you think you were with,


1105
01:21:02.441 --> 01:21:03.734
but it wasn't her.

1106
01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.736
You know damn well Juliet wasn't there.

1107
01:21:05.778 --> 01:21:06.946
You know!

1108
01:21:07.238 --> 01:21:08.489
Why don't you just give Gene a call?

1109
01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:09.865
Okay, he owns the Cozy Nook.

1110
01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:12.159
You give him a call, he'll
clear this whole thing up.


1111
01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:13.494
Give him a fuckin' call.

1112
01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:14.787
Pick up the phone.

1113
01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:16.914
Give him a call.

1114
01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:20.584
Robert, you really
don't know what you did, do you?


1115
01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:21.919
You really don't know
what you did, do you?


1116
01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:23.671
Jules, you in there?

1117
01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:27.258
Yeah, uh, Jules is fine, Mr. Lee.

1118
01:22:05.045 --> 01:22:06.714
I don't think
you can smoke in here.


1119
01:22:37.995 --> 01:22:39.330
Marry me, Jules.

1120
01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:32.109
Yeah, just sit there.

1121
01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:34.111
Just fucking sit there, Bobby.

1122
01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:39.199
How could you fucking do that, seriously?

1123
01:24:39.491 --> 01:24:41.284
You're just gonna fucking not listen to me

1124
01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.203
the entire fucking time, huh?

1125
01:24:48.751 --> 01:24:50.127
Do you even fucking care about me?

1126
01:24:50.169 --> 01:24:52.254
Do you even fucking care about me, huh?

1127
01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:54.757
Fucking care about me, huh?

1128
01:24:57.676 --> 01:24:58.969
- Is that what's gonna happen?
- Yeah.


1129
01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:00.095
And then what are we gonna do?

1130
01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:01.054
I'm gonna
fucking move outta here.


1131
01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:02.305
Yeah, all right.

1132
01:25:02.347 --> 01:25:03.974
- I only cheated with you.
- Stop it!


1133
01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:05.809
No more fucking lying!

1134
01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:12.524
Leave me, is that
what you're gonna do, huh?


1135
01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:13.859
You're just gonna leave me?

1136
01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:15.485
Like I don't love you?

1137
01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:17.863
Like I haven't given you everything?

1138
01:27:54.144 --> 01:27:55.896
I love you.

1139
01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:25.801
You really love me, huh?

1140
01:28:44.444 --> 01:28:46.363
A discovery
inside a walk-up apartment


1141
01:28:46.405 --> 01:28:47.906
on Berkeley Place.

1142
01:28:47.948 --> 01:28:52.035
A woman is dead and police say
her boyfriend is responsible.


1143
01:28:52.119 --> 01:28:53.745
Officers tell us they responded

1144
01:28:53.787 --> 01:28:56.790
to a domestic disturbance
earlier this evening


1145
01:28:56.832 --> 01:29:00.001
after they got a call
from the complex landlord.


1146
01:29:00.043 --> 01:29:02.712
Officers tell us inside
the second floor apartment


1147
01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:05.924
they found 24 year
old Jules Rable is dead

1148
01:29:05.966 --> 01:29:07.968
in a pool of her blood.

1149
01:29:08.051 --> 01:29:10.846
The woman had a wound on her neck.

1150
01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:01.021
Hey.

1151
01:30:02.898 --> 01:30:04.024
You okay?

1152
01:30:34.805 --> 01:30:38.058
"I'm done, Bobby, even if
you weren't fucking Ashley,


1153
01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:40.310
which I know you'll never admit to.

1154
01:30:40.936 --> 01:30:41.937
I'm done.

1155
01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:43.855
You know I start soon again soon,

1156
01:30:43.897 --> 01:30:46.149
and I'm finally get along with my mom.

1157
01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:48.860
It took me a
while to admit to myself,

1158
01:30:48.902 --> 01:30:51.446
but the truth is I just feel
better when you're not around.


1159
01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:54.574
And um, I think I really
think that writing this letter


1160
01:30:54.616 --> 01:30:57.077
is a lot safer than telling
you all this in person.


1161
01:30:58.495 --> 01:31:01.623
There's a real violence in
you and I don't wanna be


1162
01:31:01.665 --> 01:31:03.834
anywhere near you when you finally erupt.

1163
01:31:05.168 --> 01:31:07.671
Please don't contact me ever again."

1164
01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:32.570
The doctors I
had been speaking with


1165
01:31:32.612 --> 01:31:34.489
want me to read this letter everyday.

1166
01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.536
To convince me what
they said I did is true.


1167
01:31:41.621 --> 01:31:43.540
That's fine, I'll read it.

1168
01:31:44.458 --> 01:31:45.500
And they can say whatever they want.

1169
01:31:45.542 --> 01:31:46.751
I really don't care.

1170
01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:52.132
'Cause I know that I beat that bastard.

1171
01:31:54.217 --> 01:31:56.678
My piss-ant lawyer wants
me to say I'm crazy.


1172
01:31:58.889 --> 01:32:01.391
Why would I do that?

1173
01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:04.352
I saved her.

1174
01:32:04.936 --> 01:32:09.483
I'm the hero, not the
monster they're describing.


1175
01:32:11.067 --> 01:32:14.863
And yet, they say I'll be
here for a very long time.


1176
01:32:43.754 --> 01:32:48.754
