1
00:02:05.565 --> 00:02:07.608
Think you know it?

2
00:02:07.693 --> 00:02:09.860
Yes, sir.

3
00:02:09.945 --> 00:02:12.154
Name the five Great Lakes.

4
00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.171
Name one.

5
00:02:30.757 --> 00:02:33.676
Lake, uh
-Lake Huron?

6
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.678
That's a boy, Joe!

7
00:02:35.762 --> 00:02:38.347
If you run, you'll catch up
with the others. Happy Easter.


8
00:02:38.432 --> 00:02:40.099
Happy Easter, sir!

9
00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:44.854
Ed, are you leaving now?

10
00:02:44.938 --> 00:02:47.857
Have to stop at LaPorte's office.
Then I'm leaving. Why?


11
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:50.985
Can you give me a push?
My car is stalled.


12
00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.196
I can't.
My wife has our car today.


13
00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:57.199
- Why don't you get a new car, Pat?
- I wish I could.


14
00:02:57.284 --> 00:02:59.660
Maybe Wally can give you a push.
Wally?


15
00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:04.832
- You're not going downtown, are you?
- I wasn't planning to.


16
00:03:04.916 --> 00:03:07.668
I'll be lucky to get home.

17
00:03:07.753 --> 00:03:10.171
Wally, can you give my car a push?

18
00:03:10.255 --> 00:03:12.252
Yeah, sure, if you can
wait a few minutes.


19
00:03:12.277 --> 00:03:13.948
I'm parked right next to yours.

20
00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:16.302
- Yeah.
- Have a nice vacation, Ed.


21
00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:18.763
- Try and get some rest.
- Thanks, Pat.


22
00:03:20.348 --> 00:03:23.768
I'd give her a push myself, only Lou has our
car today and I've got to get downtown.


23
00:03:23.852 --> 00:03:25.772
- Say, you're coming tonight, aren't you?
- Sure.


24
00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:27.772
- Who you bringing?
- Just myself.


25
00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:30.191
Why don't you bring Pat?
She's nice.


26
00:03:31.818 --> 00:03:34.653
Yeah, I just might.

27
00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:41.410
How long are you gonna be stuck here?
May I?


28
00:03:41.495 --> 00:03:45.414
Couple of hours at least, unless you want
to take on those parents for me.


29
00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:47.124
I can't.

30
00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.147
If you wanna bring those
reports over tonight,


31
00:03:49.172 --> 00:03:50.944
I'll get them cleaned
up for you tomorrow.


32
00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:56.300
Hello, darling.
I'm stuck here at school again.


33
00:03:56.384 --> 00:03:58.464
No, it's a meeting with a
couple of board members.


34
00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.161
I'm sorry I didn't
let you know sooner.


35
00:04:01.264 --> 00:04:04.683
No, I won't forget.
So long.


36
00:04:05.727 --> 00:04:09.063
Why can't you tell your wife
about your job with the cab company?


37
00:04:09.147 --> 00:04:12.066
- She'd think it isn't good enough for me.
- Well, it isn't.


38
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.110
- Pays the bills.
- Fine thing...


39
00:04:14.194 --> 00:04:17.446
as good a teacher as you are
has to be working on the side.


40
00:04:17.531 --> 00:04:20.449
Let me have the bus fare, will you.
I'll give it back to you tonight.


41
00:04:20.534 --> 00:04:24.120
- What time are we expected?
- Lou said about... 7:30?


42
00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:26.539
7:30. Thank you, Bob.

43
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.798
- Would you like to come in now, ladies?
- Yes.


44
00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:43.222
Hey!

45
00:05:00.198 --> 00:05:02.199
Hey, Voice!

46
00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:13.335
Hiya, Voice. Hey, try to keep me in the
Ridgemont district today, will ya? Number 12.


47
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.754
- Okay, 12, I'll remember.
- Good. Thanks.


48
00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.174
Hey, Voice, keep me Central, will ya?

49
00:05:18.258 --> 00:05:21.427
- Remember, I'm 36, Central.
- How are you doing on the horses?


50
00:05:21.511 --> 00:05:24.430
Hey, that's what I mean.
Don't give me any runs to the track.


51
00:05:24.514 --> 00:05:28.100
If I stay there, I bet.
If I bet, I lose. So it's your fault.


52
00:05:28.185 --> 00:05:31.187
- Okay, 36. Central.
- Thanks, Voice.


53
00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:34.481
I got a budget, you know.

54
00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:37.484
Hey, you okay?

55
00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.737
Yeah, I'm
-I'm all right.

56
00:05:47.037 --> 00:05:49.413
- Hi.
- Hi, Ed.


57
00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:52.541
- Want some coffee?
- Thanks.


58
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.630
- Busy?
- So-so.


59
00:05:57.714 --> 00:06:00.925
Yellow Cab.

60
00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.052
Yellow Cab.

61
00:06:03.136 --> 00:06:06.805
216 West Avenue North?
Race track?


62
00:06:11.186 --> 00:06:13.729
Hi, Dad!

63
00:06:13.813 --> 00:06:15.397
Hi, Son.

64
00:06:15.482 --> 00:06:17.066
Bring me anything?

65
00:06:19.277 --> 00:06:21.195
Trout season opens tomorrow.

66
00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:24.073
Now, what did I forget?

67
00:06:24.157 --> 00:06:27.910
I know, Mr. Daniels. It just makes it
difficult for tonight, that's all.


68
00:06:27.994 --> 00:06:29.912
Yes. All right.

69
00:06:29.996 --> 00:06:32.748
- You bring the olives?
- Ohh!


70
00:06:32.832 --> 00:06:35.584
- I - I'll go right out.
- No, never mind.


71
00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.587
- The water heater's off again.
- Was that Daniels you were talking to?


72
00:06:38.672 --> 00:06:41.590
Yes. He said he'd be over
to fix it in the morning.


73
00:06:41.675 --> 00:06:44.134
What kept you so long?
You know we're having company tonight.


74
00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:47.137
I called you, dear.
Couple of members of the school board.


75
00:06:47.222 --> 00:06:48.847
- Can I help?
- No.


76
00:06:48.932 --> 00:06:52.101
The members of the board seem to be
unusually active this year, don't they?


77
00:06:52.185 --> 00:06:55.104
Yee-haw!

78
00:07:01.778 --> 00:07:04.530
- Hmm.
- Well, are we going fishin'?


79
00:07:04.614 --> 00:07:07.700
- Doesn't this stuff bore you?
- No.


80
00:07:07.784 --> 00:07:10.869
- It's always the same story.
- I know.


81
00:07:10.954 --> 00:07:14.623
Everybody's going fishin'.
Paul and his dad are.


82
00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:16.625
- Everybody!
- I can't help that.


83
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.795
- I have work to do.
- But vacation started today.


84
00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:22.298
- Have you practiced your music?
- Not yet.


85
00:07:22.382 --> 00:07:24.967
Well, why don't you do that
while I help your mother.


86
00:07:25.051 --> 00:07:27.636
Wally and the LaPortes
are coming over tonight.


87
00:07:27.661 --> 00:07:28.953
Can I stay up late?

88
00:07:30.932 --> 00:07:34.310
We'll see.
Collect all this junk.


89
00:07:43.486 --> 00:07:45.654
How many are coming, Lou?

90
00:07:45.739 --> 00:07:48.866
The LaPortes, the Joneses
and Wally, so far.


91
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.661
But we need one more if we're going to
play two tables. Is Wally bringing anyone?


92
00:07:52.746 --> 00:07:55.664
I asked him to bring Pat Wade.

93
00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:57.666
I thought she only played hearts.

94
00:07:57.751 --> 00:08:00.252
I think she plays bridge.

95
00:08:00.337 --> 00:08:02.338
Two tables, huh?

96
00:08:03.673 --> 00:08:08.093
Well, it isn't simply a matter of choosing between
having a baby or buying a vacuum cleaner.


97
00:08:08.178 --> 00:08:11.764
- Well, at least it shouldn't... be.
- Well, you don't have a child with asthma.


98
00:08:11.848 --> 00:08:14.266
I don't care much the doctor
says it's psychosomatic.


99
00:08:14.351 --> 00:08:18.604
As far as I'm concerned it's the dust,
and we need a new vacuum cleaner.


100
00:08:18.688 --> 00:08:20.898
Seven spades,
doubled and redoubled.


101
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.152
- Do you have some kind of pain, Ed?
- Nothing's wrong.


102
00:08:33.703 --> 00:08:36.538
- The game's over.
- That's good.


103
00:08:37.707 --> 00:08:41.126
I only had them because of you,
and you spend half the evening in here.


104
00:08:41.211 --> 00:08:44.129
Why don't you help them find their coats.
I'll be right in.


105
00:08:44.214 --> 00:08:45.714
Ed...

106
00:08:54.057 --> 00:08:56.308
- There you go.
- Tell me, Bob.


107
00:08:56.393 --> 00:08:59.812
Why is it necessary for you and Ed to have
board meetings every other afternoon?


108
00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:01.814
Just a couple of board members
today, Lou.


109
00:09:01.898 --> 00:09:04.650
I think they should leave you
alone for a while. You do enough.


110
00:09:04.734 --> 00:09:07.152
- This is a new poster, isn't it, Ed?
- Yes, it is.


111
00:09:07.237 --> 00:09:10.489
- We have to run. Good night.
- Good night, everybody! Thanks for everything!


112
00:09:10.573 --> 00:09:13.826
Remember the days when we used to resent
vacations because they interrupted our work?


113
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.577
Not me, Ed.

114
00:09:15.662 --> 00:09:18.580
- Good night, Lou.
- You've never looked more beautiful, Vi.


115
00:09:18.665 --> 00:09:21.083
Thanks, Lou.
It's because I'm having the baby.


116
00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:22.584
- Good night, Vi.
- Good night, Ed.


117
00:09:22.669 --> 00:09:24.378
- See you tomorrow, Ed.
- Good night.


118
00:09:24.462 --> 00:09:26.088
- Thanks again, Lou.
- Good-bye, Pat.


119
00:09:26.172 --> 00:09:27.881
- Good night, Pat.
- Good night, Ed.


120
00:09:27.966 --> 00:09:29.550
Trout season opens tomorrow.

121
00:09:29.634 --> 00:09:33.554
What do you say you, Lou, Richie and I get a
couple of sleeping bags, take off for a few days?


122
00:09:33.638 --> 00:09:36.849
- Maybe next weekend.
- Okay. Good night, Ed.


123
00:09:36.933 --> 00:09:38.934
- Good night, Wally.
- Good night.


124
00:10:23.229 --> 00:10:25.481
Leave them, honey.

125
00:10:25.565 --> 00:10:27.232
All right.

126
00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:43.207
Wouldn't it be great for both of us
to really get away one of these days?


127
00:10:43.291 --> 00:10:45.542
Mm-hmm.

128
00:10:45.627 --> 00:10:48.754
- You like the Joneses?
- They're all right.


129
00:10:48.838 --> 00:10:50.756
- I think she's very nice.
- Who?


130
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.424
Mrs. Jones.

131
00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:54.092
She gripes too much.

132
00:10:54.177 --> 00:10:55.928
I think they're both dull.

133
00:10:56.012 --> 00:10:58.555
- You think they're what?
- Dull!


134
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.349
So are we.

135
00:11:00.433 --> 00:11:03.060
- What did you say?
- So are we.


136
00:11:03.144 --> 00:11:04.937
You are, I am.

137
00:11:05.021 --> 00:11:06.855
Let's face it - we're dull.

138
00:11:15.156 --> 00:11:17.157
Have you found somebody who isn't?

139
00:11:17.992 --> 00:11:19.993
What do you mean by that?

140
00:11:22.038 --> 00:11:24.873
There was no board meeting.

141
00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:26.500
Where were you?

142
00:11:26.584 --> 00:11:30.379
I told you.
What did you think I was doing?


143
00:11:30.463 --> 00:11:34.341
You can't expect me to figure that out.
I'm supposed to be dull. Remember?


144
00:11:34.425 --> 00:11:36.802
I said we all are.

145
00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:41.682
Tell me one thing that was said or done
by anyone here tonight...


146
00:11:41.766 --> 00:11:45.394
that was funny, startling, imaginative...

147
00:11:46.229 --> 00:11:49.189
Ed?

148
00:11:52.277 --> 00:11:54.152
Ed?

149
00:11:54.237 --> 00:11:56.238
Oh, Ed.

150
00:11:58.491 --> 00:12:01.451
Oh, Richie, Richie,
get Dr. Norton on the phone.


151
00:12:01.536 --> 00:12:04.746
- What's his phone number?
- Oh, it's...


152
00:12:04.831 --> 00:12:07.499
It's in the book
right next to the phone.

153
00:12:07.584 --> 00:12:09.835
Hurry, darling.

154
00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:11.920
And call Uncle Wally too.

155
00:12:18.511 --> 00:12:21.555
Oh, Ed. Oh, Ed.

156
00:12:30.815 --> 00:12:33.483
You should've told me
about this before, Ed.


157
00:12:33.568 --> 00:12:36.612
I thought I was just overly tired.

158
00:12:36.696 --> 00:12:39.615
It isn't as if the pain
was always in the same place.


159
00:12:39.699 --> 00:12:41.617
It's the first time I've blacked out.

160
00:12:41.701 --> 00:12:44.119
And it's been going on for six months.

161
00:12:44.203 --> 00:12:46.163
More or less.

162
00:12:46.247 --> 00:12:49.416
- You wanna go with me?
- No, Doctor, I'll take him in our car.


163
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.501
- All right. I'll go on ahead.
- Okay.


164
00:12:51.586 --> 00:12:53.503
I'll see you there later.

165
00:12:53.588 --> 00:12:55.964
Did he tell you anything
I should know?


166
00:12:56.049 --> 00:12:58.133
He doesn't know anything yet.

167
00:12:58.217 --> 00:13:00.844
- Well, it can't be very serious then.
- No.


168
00:13:03.097 --> 00:13:04.806
Excuse me.

169
00:13:04.891 --> 00:13:06.475
- Good night, Doctor.
- Good night, Doctor.


170
00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:09.061
Good night.
Good night, Richie.


171
00:13:20.323 --> 00:13:22.240
Let's see if I've forgotten anything.

172
00:13:22.325 --> 00:13:25.077
Your toothbrush, your pajamas -
Oh, your slippers!


173
00:13:25.161 --> 00:13:26.745
I'll get them.

174
00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:31.750
If a teacher has to be sick, he owes it to himself
to be sick on school days and not on vacations.


175
00:13:31.834 --> 00:13:34.252
- Thanks for coming over, Wally.
- Here, let me take that.


176
00:13:34.337 --> 00:13:38.924
Since you're promoting your self to breakfast in
bed for a week, you might as well go in style.


177
00:13:39.008 --> 00:13:42.511
Let's come in here for a minute.

178
00:13:48.518 --> 00:13:52.437
You know, Richie, you're gonna be
head man around here while I'm gone.


179
00:13:52.522 --> 00:13:55.440
I want you to take good care
of your mother.


180
00:13:55.525 --> 00:13:58.110
I'll look out for her.
Don't you worry.


181
00:13:58.194 --> 00:13:59.861
That's a boy.

182
00:14:00.988 --> 00:14:03.240
Look at this thing.
It's like a stewed prune.


183
00:14:03.324 --> 00:14:05.409
- Get the bike pump.
- Coming up.


184
00:14:10.915 --> 00:14:12.833
I bring the needle valve.

185
00:14:12.917 --> 00:14:15.836
Well, sit down, hold the ball
and I'll "brung" some air into it.


186
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.587
Okay, brought.

187
00:14:17.672 --> 00:14:22.050
Boy, I wish I would have been there
when you won that game.


188
00:14:22.135 --> 00:14:25.637
Third-string sub to hero
in 20 seconds.


189
00:14:25.722 --> 00:14:27.639
Real last-minute stuff.

190
00:14:27.724 --> 00:14:30.809
You shouldn't kid about it, Dad.
You won the game for 'em.


191
00:14:30.893 --> 00:14:33.395
Sure was the high school hero that day.

192
00:14:36.733 --> 00:14:38.859
Here. It's yours.

193
00:14:38.943 --> 00:14:40.861
For me to keep in my room?

194
00:14:40.945 --> 00:14:43.864
No, outdoors.
Kick it around with the other kids.


195
00:14:43.948 --> 00:14:45.866
Maybe they'll make you captain.

196
00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:49.578
Mom, Dad just gave me his football!
I'm gonna tell Uncle Wally!


197
00:14:54.292 --> 00:14:55.834
Don't look so grim.

198
00:14:55.918 --> 00:14:58.628
I'm sorry.

199
00:14:58.713 --> 00:15:01.715
I think I'm just very tired.
You know?


200
00:15:01.799 --> 00:15:04.009
Well, a few days rest won't hurt.

201
00:15:04.093 --> 00:15:07.137
No, they... won't.

202
00:15:10.933 --> 00:15:13.310
Ed!

203
00:15:30.953 --> 00:15:32.621
I'm all right now.

204
00:15:34.457 --> 00:15:37.375
- I'd better get going.
- I'll get my coat.


205
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.211
- Let Wally take me.
- No!


206
00:15:39.295 --> 00:15:43.381
I don't want Richie seeing me in one
of these spells or whatever they are.


207
00:15:43.466 --> 00:15:45.884
Do this my way.

208
00:15:45.968 --> 00:15:47.636
Please.

209
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.682
All right.

210
00:16:13.287 --> 00:16:16.331
Oh, his slippers. Ed!

211
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.034
All right, Nurse.

212
00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.623
- Ready, Doctor.
- Lights, please.


213
00:17:00.293 --> 00:17:04.379
When I turn the lights out drink
this, please, one swallow at a time.


214
00:17:04.463 --> 00:17:06.506
- What is it?
- Barium.


215
00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:08.884
Don't swallow until I tell you to, please.

216
00:17:08.968 --> 00:17:11.136
- Ready, Doctor?
- Mm-hmm.


217
00:17:17.143 --> 00:17:25.143
Swallow, please.

218
00:17:34.785 --> 00:17:37.787
- How's the view down there?
- Mm-hmm.


219
00:17:38.998 --> 00:17:40.916
- Hello, Doctor.
- Have you two been introduced?


220
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.003
I've taken all specimens, blood counts, tests,
with the exception of the Brom Sulphalien.


221
00:17:45.087 --> 00:17:48.173
Oh, I'd say that constitutes an
introduction. How'd you sleep?


222
00:17:48.257 --> 00:17:50.175
- Once in a while.
- Hello, Dr. Ruric.


223
00:17:50.259 --> 00:17:53.678
Doctor, I can't afford this private room.
I'm a schoolteacher, not a plumber.


224
00:17:53.763 --> 00:17:55.723
I know, and if this takes longer
than I expected...


225
00:17:55.765 --> 00:17:57.182
Longer?

226
00:17:57.266 --> 00:18:01.186
Well, at this point your symptoms could mean
anything from arthritis to trichinosis.


227
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:04.189
That's why I've called in a specialist
for a consultation.


228
00:18:04.273 --> 00:18:06.358
This is Dr. Ruric
of the college of medicine.


229
00:18:06.442 --> 00:18:08.360
He's particularly interested
in your symptoms.


230
00:18:08.444 --> 00:18:10.362
- Mr. Avery.
- Glad to know you.


231
00:18:10.446 --> 00:18:12.364
- Have you prepared for examination?
- Yes, Doctor.


232
00:18:12.448 --> 00:18:13.865
- Another?
- Relax.


233
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.201
We'll really put you
through the mill tomorrow.


234
00:18:22.458 --> 00:18:25.710
Leucocytosis and indication
of vascular spasm.


235
00:18:25.795 --> 00:18:27.879
Hmm.

236
00:18:27.964 --> 00:18:30.382
- Biopsy?
- Yeah.


237
00:18:30.466 --> 00:18:34.386
Ed, put your finger on one of the spots
where the pain occurs.


238
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:38.723
No, we don't want to open you up.
How about an arm or a leg?


239
00:18:39.809 --> 00:18:42.477
This one here is a beaut.

240
00:18:42.561 --> 00:18:44.604
Branch of the popliteal artery.

241
00:18:44.689 --> 00:18:47.816
- Take a section of the gastrocnemius?
- Mmm.


242
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.734
Yeah.

243
00:18:49.819 --> 00:18:53.530
Easy, Ed. We just want to take
a sample of your calf muscle.


244
00:18:54.699 --> 00:18:56.408
We'll wash up.

245
00:18:58.619 --> 00:19:00.620
Turn over, please.

246
00:19:43.956 --> 00:19:48.209
One more little piece of surgery, Ed.
It's called a sternal puncture.


247
00:19:48.294 --> 00:19:50.587
Here we go again.

248
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:53.798
No, no!
Sternum means breastbone.


249
00:19:54.967 --> 00:19:58.136
Oh, sorry.
I did four years in the navy.


250
00:19:59.138 --> 00:20:02.390
- Can I see Mr. Avery now?
- Yes. Room 61.


251
00:20:02.475 --> 00:20:05.560
- Will you tell Ed I'll be right in?
- Yes, Doctor.


252
00:20:09.148 --> 00:20:11.274
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.


253
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:15.028
- Hiya, Voice.
- Hi.


254
00:20:15.112 --> 00:20:18.031
I had a fare right to the desk,
so I'm lookin' in. How are ya?


255
00:20:18.115 --> 00:20:19.657
I'm fine.

256
00:20:19.742 --> 00:20:22.660
- Sam, I'd like you to meet my wife.
- How do you do?


257
00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:25.413
- How do you do?
- They all miss ya down at the garage.


258
00:20:25.498 --> 00:20:27.832
Tell them hello.

259
00:20:27.917 --> 00:20:31.127
You're lookin' pretty good.

260
00:20:32.171 --> 00:20:35.340
- Who was that?
- He's a man I know.


261
00:20:36.926 --> 00:20:40.261
- He's a cabdriver.
- Oh, I'd never have known.


262
00:20:41.305 --> 00:20:44.516
- What do you have to do with the garage?
- What do I have to do?


263
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.560
Well, it's just a
bunch of fellows I know.

264
00:20:47.645 --> 00:20:50.730
- Well, he said they missed you.
- Guess they do.


265
00:20:51.816 --> 00:20:54.734
Look, Ed, what's all this about?

266
00:20:54.819 --> 00:20:57.779
Have you been working at a garage?

267
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.368
Yes.

268
00:21:03.452 --> 00:21:05.829
Two or three afternoons a week.

269
00:21:05.913 --> 00:21:08.623
- After school?
- Yes.


270
00:21:10.209 --> 00:21:13.545
- Why didn't you let me know?
- Well...


271
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.382
I had to make
some extra money somehow.


272
00:21:19.468 --> 00:21:21.386
Are you laughing at me?

273
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:25.223
Oh, yes 
- Oh, Ed!

274
00:21:25.307 --> 00:21:27.225
Ed, I'm so small-minded.

275
00:21:27.309 --> 00:21:29.352
I 
- I thought...

276
00:21:29.436 --> 00:21:31.479
you were having a big romance.

277
00:21:31.564 --> 00:21:33.481
- You did?
- Yes, I did.


278
00:21:33.566 --> 00:21:35.483
Oh, it isn't funny!

279
00:21:35.568 --> 00:21:39.821
Oh, Ed, you're a wonderful,
handsome man.


280
00:21:39.905 --> 00:21:43.116
I like the idea of you being jealous.

281
00:21:44.243 --> 00:21:46.494
Morning, Ed.

282
00:21:46.579 --> 00:21:48.580
- Morning.
- Morning.


283
00:21:51.041 --> 00:21:54.127
Well, what's the verdict?

284
00:21:59.925 --> 00:22:03.595
We don't have any secrets.
Not now.


285
00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:05.680
So whatever you have to say...

286
00:22:05.764 --> 00:22:11.477
Well, the laboratory findings confirm
Dr. Norton's original diagnosis.


287
00:22:11.562 --> 00:22:14.647
There's a definite increase
in the eosinophils.


288
00:22:14.732 --> 00:22:19.444
Periarteritis nodosa, an extremely rare
inflammation of the arteries.


289
00:22:19.528 --> 00:22:24.365
You're the first case I've had.
Dr. Ruric has treated 10 or 12.


290
00:22:26.535 --> 00:22:28.786
Well?

291
00:22:28.871 --> 00:22:30.872
The prognosis is poor.

292
00:22:33.167 --> 00:22:34.792
How poor?

293
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:40.715
The great majority of cases have proved
fatal within a year after the first attack.


294
00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:45.553
However, during the past year we have had
some success with a new drug...


295
00:22:45.638 --> 00:22:47.722
but we are still experimenting with it.

296
00:22:47.806 --> 00:22:51.184
- A miracle drug?
- Some people think it is.


297
00:22:53.896 --> 00:22:56.898
Well, why don't we find out for sure?

298
00:22:56.982 --> 00:22:59.025
Is that what you want me to say?

299
00:22:59.109 --> 00:23:01.402
It's called cortisone.

300
00:23:01.487 --> 00:23:03.071
It's a hormone.

301
00:23:03.155 --> 00:23:05.907
I'm sorry to have been
so outspoken, Lou, but...


302
00:23:05.991 --> 00:23:08.910
if you'll think of the number of advances
in the past few years...


303
00:23:08.994 --> 00:23:13.581
such as in the treatment of mastoiditis,
typhoid and pneumonia...


304
00:23:13.666 --> 00:23:15.792
you have every reason
to feel hopeful.


305
00:23:17.169 --> 00:23:19.712
Ah, just the lady I was looking for.

306
00:23:19.797 --> 00:23:23.758
A couple of forms here they'd like you
to sign, Lou. Do you mind doing it now?


307
00:23:23.842 --> 00:23:25.635
May I come back?

308
00:23:25.719 --> 00:23:28.721
Yes, of course, in a little while.

309
00:23:30.975 --> 00:23:32.892
I'll be right here, darling.

310
00:23:32.977 --> 00:23:34.602
Right here.

311
00:24:26.322 --> 00:24:29.407
- You think they're home already?
- No, or the car'd be out in front.


312
00:24:29.491 --> 00:24:31.993
What, is this door locked?

313
00:24:32.077 --> 00:24:34.662
No, you just gotta know how.

314
00:24:34.747 --> 00:24:36.456
Oh.

315
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.336
Now, don't let me forget
these steaks, Richie.


316
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.465
Hand me the yogurt, the black strap
molasses and the brewer's yeast.


317
00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:49.802
Miracle drugs or no miracle drugs,
we're gonna have to build your father up.


318
00:24:49.887 --> 00:24:53.514
I want you to learn how to fix this
and you make him drink it every morning.


319
00:24:54.516 --> 00:24:57.435
That a boy. Now...

320
00:24:57.519 --> 00:25:00.271
See, you take a
half a jar of yogurt...

321
00:25:02.608 --> 00:25:04.025
Got it?

322
00:25:04.109 --> 00:25:07.528
Now you get a tablespoon full of molasses -
Black strap molasses.


323
00:25:09.281 --> 00:25:11.282
- Mom! Dad!
- Hey, hey.


324
00:25:16.747 --> 00:25:18.331
Where's Dad?

325
00:25:18.415 --> 00:25:21.334
They wanted to keep him one more night
just to be sure. Hi, Wally!


326
00:25:21.418 --> 00:25:23.137
Hi. The pains didn't
start again, did they?


327
00:25:23.162 --> 00:25:24.762
Oh, no, no. He feels
just wonderful.


328
00:25:24.797 --> 00:25:26.618
How much longer are
they gonna keep him?


329
00:25:26.643 --> 00:25:28.907
Just tonight. We'll go
get him in the morning.


330
00:25:28.967 --> 00:25:31.886
- What's going on in the kitchen?
- They say when he can go back to work?


331
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.222
Ed says he wants to go tomorrow.

332
00:25:34.306 --> 00:25:37.600
- Well, he oughta wait a couple of days.
- I think so too.


333
00:25:40.479 --> 00:25:42.397
Who are all these steaks for?

334
00:25:42.481 --> 00:25:43.898
Oh, they're mine.

335
00:25:43.982 --> 00:25:46.567
Steaks every night?

336
00:25:46.652 --> 00:25:50.905
Well, a gym teacher has to keep
in shape, you know. Here, try this.


337
00:25:50.989 --> 00:25:53.282
- What is it?
- That's tiger's milk.


338
00:25:53.367 --> 00:25:56.911
Go on, try it.
It'll really put hair on your chest.


339
00:25:57.996 --> 00:26:00.581
What a day!

340
00:26:00.666 --> 00:26:03.668
I think we've worked out
your proper cortisone dosage, Ed.


341
00:26:03.752 --> 00:26:07.505
From now on you'll continue
in tablet form, one every six hours.


342
00:26:07.589 --> 00:26:09.966
- Is that right, Doctor?
- That's right.


343
00:26:10.968 --> 00:26:13.886
This is the greatest thing
that's come our way since penicillin.


344
00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:16.931
I want you back in the office
a week from today for a checkup.


345
00:26:17.015 --> 00:26:19.767
In the meantime, if you should notice
any adverse symptoms...


346
00:26:19.852 --> 00:26:22.895
Doctor, a man as broke as I am
can't afford any more symptoms.


347
00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.179
Once in a while cortisone
gets a little tricky.


348
00:26:25.204 --> 00:26:26.256
It certainly does.

349
00:26:26.316 --> 00:26:29.735
That's why even the slightest period of
depression is important for us to know about.


350
00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.237
Why should I be depressed?

351
00:26:31.321 --> 00:26:34.241
A week ago it looked as though
I'd have maybe four or five months to live.


352
00:26:34.324 --> 00:26:36.367
This morning I go back to work.

353
00:26:36.452 --> 00:26:40.121
- Your family's waiting for you downstairs.
- Oh, fine, fine.


354
00:26:40.205 --> 00:26:42.748
How long will I have to take these?

355
00:26:43.876 --> 00:26:45.460
I'm afraid indefinitely.

356
00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:49.714
Oh. I see.

357
00:26:49.798 --> 00:26:51.299
Anything else?

358
00:26:51.383 --> 00:26:53.301
No. You're all packed?

359
00:26:53.385 --> 00:26:56.304
- I've been ready for hours.
- Do you want these crossword puzzles?


360
00:26:56.388 --> 00:27:00.224
I've finished them all.
They make them too easy these days.


361
00:27:00.309 --> 00:27:02.143
I'd better be going.

362
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:10.067
- Thanks very much.
- Not at all, Ed.


363
00:27:10.152 --> 00:27:12.111
More than I can really say.

364
00:27:12.196 --> 00:27:13.738
Good-bye, Nurse.

365
00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.741
- Ed, you forgot your pills.
- Oh.


366
00:27:16.825 --> 00:27:19.744
Now remember, one every six hours.
No more, no less.


367
00:27:19.828 --> 00:27:22.330
- I'll see you a week from today.
- Right.


368
00:27:37.221 --> 00:27:41.015
Well, here we are again -
Male schoolmarm.


369
00:27:41.099 --> 00:27:44.519
Well, I'm funny that way - always proud
to say I'm a schoolteacher's wife.


370
00:27:44.603 --> 00:27:46.521
I tell you...

371
00:27:46.605 --> 00:27:50.691
when I came down into the hospital lobby
and saw you and Richie again...


372
00:27:50.776 --> 00:27:52.401
I felt 10 feet tall.

373
00:27:54.112 --> 00:27:56.906
You've always been 10 feet tall to me.

374
00:28:04.748 --> 00:28:06.666
Now, in your own words...

375
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:11.254
why did Cassius refer to
Julius Caesar as a "colossus"?


376
00:28:17.177 --> 00:28:20.638
Will you take over Miss Wade's class?
She hasn't come in yet.


377
00:28:20.722 --> 00:28:22.723
Certainly.

378
00:28:22.808 --> 00:28:25.726
Joe, will you take charge of the class
while I'm gone, please?


379
00:28:25.811 --> 00:28:27.478
Yes, sir!

380
00:28:31.316 --> 00:28:33.734
Hey, Squirrel, in your own words...

381
00:28:33.819 --> 00:28:37.780
why did Cassius refer to
Julius Caesar as a "colossus"?


382
00:28:37.864 --> 00:28:40.324
- You holding up all right?
- Fine.


383
00:28:40.409 --> 00:28:43.661
Time to take one.
They seem to be doing the trick.


384
00:28:43.745 --> 00:28:46.664
We can arrange for a substitute
for a couple of days, if you need it.


385
00:28:46.748 --> 00:28:48.749
I wouldn't think of it.

386
00:28:59.845 --> 00:29:02.763
Okay, settle down, all of you.
Into your seats.


387
00:29:06.977 --> 00:29:08.894
Is he running on schedule?

388
00:29:08.979 --> 00:29:10.980
Nope. Ten minutes late.

389
00:29:11.064 --> 00:29:14.025
- Better wash up, get ready for reading.
- Yes, sir.


390
00:29:16.361 --> 00:29:19.322
- You like dogs?
- It's a cow.


391
00:29:19.406 --> 00:29:23.242
- A cow with five legs?
- It can stand better.


392
00:29:23.327 --> 00:29:24.994
Time to wash up.

393
00:29:28.832 --> 00:29:31.834
Say, that's a fine, uh... thunderstorm?

394
00:29:31.918 --> 00:29:36.380
This is a man.
He's just mad at his mother.


395
00:29:38.634 --> 00:29:41.761
Oh, thanks, Ed, for taking over for me.

396
00:29:41.845 --> 00:29:44.805
My car broke down
just 10 minutes outside of town.


397
00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:46.807
Should have known better
than to take it.


398
00:29:46.892 --> 00:29:48.809
You did get some rest, didn't you?

399
00:29:48.894 --> 00:29:50.811
- Sure.
- Children, get ready for reading.


400
00:29:50.896 --> 00:29:53.689
You look wonderful.
Where did you get that dress?


401
00:29:53.774 --> 00:29:56.692
I had to have something to wear
to the ladies forum.


402
00:29:56.777 --> 00:29:58.986
- Where'd you buy it?
- In the French room at Martin's.


403
00:29:59.071 --> 00:30:02.114
Once every year I get carried away.

404
00:30:02.199 --> 00:30:05.534
- How do you feel?
- I feel fine, fine.


405
00:30:05.619 --> 00:30:07.662
LaPorte wants to see you
after school.


406
00:30:07.746 --> 00:30:09.872
Naturally.

407
00:30:09.956 --> 00:30:13.626
- Thanks again, Ed, for taking over for me.
- You're welcome.


408
00:30:22.302 --> 00:30:23.886
No, I took one.

409
00:30:29.434 --> 00:30:31.102
Hi, Mom!

410
00:30:38.610 --> 00:30:40.528
Wow!

411
00:30:48.036 --> 00:30:50.037
Dad's home!

412
00:30:51.581 --> 00:30:54.542
Oh, darling!

413
00:30:54.626 --> 00:30:57.253
- How do you feel? How did it go?
- I feel great!


414
00:30:57.337 --> 00:30:59.714
- What's been going on here?
- I've been baking a cake.


415
00:30:59.798 --> 00:31:01.298
Mmm!

416
00:31:08.181 --> 00:31:10.891
All right, come on, both of you.
We're going out!


417
00:31:10.976 --> 00:31:13.394
- Now? Where?
- Places.


418
00:31:13.478 --> 00:31:16.355
- I haven't even finished frosting the cake.
- No arguments!


419
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:18.733
- Get your coats and hats!
- Well, Ed...


420
00:31:20.652 --> 00:31:23.821
- Aw, come on, Dad. Where are we going?
- Never mind.


421
00:31:23.905 --> 00:31:26.824
Oh, Ed, what's come over you?
Is it a surprise?


422
00:31:26.908 --> 00:31:29.410
You'll find out when we get there.

423
00:31:34.875 --> 00:31:37.793
But, Ed, you won't even help me
pick out a pair of stockings.


424
00:31:37.878 --> 00:31:39.879
Don't quibble.
Big occasion.


425
00:31:44.009 --> 00:31:47.011
This is so expensive.
I buy my things at Madame Mae's Frock Shop.


426
00:31:47.095 --> 00:31:50.014
Madame Mae's Frock Shop doesn't cater
to women with terrific curves.


427
00:31:50.098 --> 00:31:53.184
- Now, Ed, just this morning you -
- Now, let me handle this.


428
00:31:53.268 --> 00:31:57.271
Well, as long as you're being so nice
about twisting my arm.


429
00:32:15.207 --> 00:32:18.125
- How do we get a salesgirl here?
- Salesgirl? Please.


430
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:21.128
I think we wait until
one of the passing Cleopatras...


431
00:32:21.213 --> 00:32:23.130
- Oh, Miss, if you don't mind -
- Miss!


432
00:32:23.215 --> 00:32:26.415
Ed, I know you're feeling your oats, but
an upper-crust sugar daddy never shouts.


433
00:32:26.468 --> 00:32:28.469
This one does. Miss!

434
00:32:29.554 --> 00:32:30.971
I beg your pardon.

435
00:32:31.056 --> 00:32:33.974
We want to buy some clothes,
if it isn't too much trouble.


436
00:32:34.059 --> 00:32:36.977
- Someone will be with you directly.
- One moment, please.


437
00:32:37.062 --> 00:32:39.980
You see, dear, my wife and I
aren't used to places like this...


438
00:32:40.065 --> 00:32:44.985
so it's only fair to tell you that if we don't get a
whole lot of high-class service, and in a hurry...


439
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:48.155
there's likely to be a terribly
embarrassing scene in this sanctum.


440
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.741
You know, dear?
Vulgar shouting.


441
00:32:51.743 --> 00:32:54.495
- That'll fetch it.
- I should think so.


442
00:32:57.916 --> 00:32:59.917
You think it's becoming?

443
00:33:00.001 --> 00:33:02.002
Honey, it's you!

444
00:33:02.087 --> 00:33:05.089
I'm sorry, madam.
Just doesn't look good on her.


445
00:33:20.438 --> 00:33:24.358
Oh, thank you, darling.
It's just absolutely the one.


446
00:33:24.442 --> 00:33:26.360
Hold everything.

447
00:33:26.444 --> 00:33:30.364
Now I'd like to see her in that.

448
00:33:35.370 --> 00:33:38.914
Oh, Ed, what are you thinking of?
All these expenses we're having.


449
00:33:38.999 --> 00:33:42.084
Relax. Everything's
going to be all right.


450
00:33:50.218 --> 00:33:53.262
Oh, dear, it's - it's heavenly.

451
00:33:53.346 --> 00:33:56.515
But, Ed, I have no use
for two like this.


452
00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.560
Of course you do!
From now on we'll be going out a lot.


453
00:33:59.644 --> 00:34:02.813
- Oh, Ed, be sensible.
- Sensible? But I like it on you.


454
00:34:02.898 --> 00:34:05.941
- And anyway, who's paying for it?
- Please, not another. One's enough!


455
00:34:06.026 --> 00:34:07.430
Lou, what's the matter with you?

456
00:34:07.455 --> 00:34:10.261
I bring you to a place like this,
try to do something nice...


457
00:34:10.322 --> 00:34:13.949
Mr. Avery, you can come again.
Your wife's tired.


458
00:34:14.034 --> 00:34:16.702
Okay. Wrap it up.

459
00:34:20.415 --> 00:34:23.584
Jacques Fath.
Christian Dior.


460
00:34:23.668 --> 00:34:28.088
Any intelligent man with a reasonable amount
of good taste could make out in this racket.


461
00:34:28.173 --> 00:34:31.091
I feel exactly as if I were
walking on cream puffs.


462
00:34:31.176 --> 00:34:34.094
Now its your turn, young fella.
The best bike shop in town.


463
00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:38.098
- I can get it myself, Dad.
- What's the matter with this family?


464
00:34:38.183 --> 00:34:41.101
Come on, Richie.
Three gears, hand brakes. You know.


465
00:34:41.186 --> 00:34:42.853
Gee!

466
00:34:45.982 --> 00:34:49.485
Mom, isn't Dad
acting a little foolish?


467
00:34:49.569 --> 00:34:53.864
Oh, darling, your daddy's just excited.
It's his first day out of the hospital.


468
00:35:00.705 --> 00:35:03.832
Signals! Nine, seven, four, three!

469
00:35:03.917 --> 00:35:05.584
That's a boy!

470
00:35:06.878 --> 00:35:10.255
Gotcha! Now let's take to the air.
Get down there.


471
00:35:11.883 --> 00:35:13.717
- Ready?
- Yeah.


472
00:35:15.845 --> 00:35:18.889
Great! Perfect spiral!

473
00:35:19.724 --> 00:35:21.058
Good boy.

474
00:35:22.227 --> 00:35:26.230
Now straight at me! That's it!

475
00:35:26.314 --> 00:35:28.816
Once more.

476
00:35:30.026 --> 00:35:33.153
Okay, I'll be right back.

477
00:35:34.656 --> 00:35:37.116
Hello? Yes, Bob.

478
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.870
Book on educational
measurements?


479
00:35:38.895 --> 00:35:41.644
No. No, I haven't read it.
When did you give it to me?


480
00:35:42.539 --> 00:35:45.916
Okay, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
Huh!


481
00:35:46.001 --> 00:35:48.460
- Who was that?
- Bob LaPorte.


482
00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:53.007
All right, right at me.
Come on.


483
00:35:54.718 --> 00:35:56.552
Good boy!

484
00:36:02.517 --> 00:36:05.102
Oh!

485
00:36:06.688 --> 00:36:08.856
You kids are going to wreck something!

486
00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:13.027
Don't be silly! Where's that ball?
Come on, throw me a pass!


487
00:36:13.111 --> 00:36:14.695
That's a boy.

488
00:36:14.779 --> 00:36:17.489
Lou, how about
bringing some sandwiches?


489
00:36:17.574 --> 00:36:19.533
You ate half the roast at dinner.

490
00:36:19.617 --> 00:36:22.036
I'm the healthy type now!

491
00:36:24.122 --> 00:36:26.415
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it!


492
00:36:28.835 --> 00:36:30.085
Yep?

493
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:32.671
- Mr. Avery. How are you feeling?
- Who is this?


494
00:36:32.756 --> 00:36:34.965
- This is Frank at the cab company.
- Oh.


495
00:36:35.050 --> 00:36:38.427
Received a call from your doctor
saying you'd be unable to work for a while.


496
00:36:38.511 --> 00:36:41.180
Wondering when you're planning
on coming back.


497
00:36:41.264 --> 00:36:43.182
As a matter of fact, I'm not.

498
00:36:43.266 --> 00:36:46.185
I'm planning something
more in line with my profession.


499
00:36:46.269 --> 00:36:48.130
You should have given
us a little warning.


500
00:36:48.155 --> 00:36:49.712
You could do me a favor though.

501
00:36:49.773 --> 00:36:53.567
Get one of your drivers to wrap up the things
in my locker and dump them off at my home.


502
00:36:55.653 --> 00:36:57.321
Okay, thanks.

503
00:36:59.657 --> 00:37:02.576
Turn that thing off!

504
00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:05.704
I hate to be a killjoy,
but it's past Richie's bedtime.


505
00:37:05.789 --> 00:37:07.372
Aw, not yet.

506
00:37:07.457 --> 00:37:09.416
- Get going!
- Yes, sir.


507
00:37:09.501 --> 00:37:11.001
Good night, sir.

508
00:37:11.086 --> 00:37:13.504
- Good night, Mom.
- Good night, darling.


509
00:37:14.547 --> 00:37:17.466
Ed, what's this new thing
you've got lined up?


510
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.010
Now, don't you
start picking on me!


511
00:37:25.809 --> 00:37:27.392
Go on up, darling.

512
00:37:36.528 --> 00:37:39.530
I'll get you
a glass of warm milk, hmm?


513
00:37:56.256 --> 00:38:00.676
I know I've been
sort of keyed up, you know.


514
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.678
I guess we've all been.

515
00:38:02.762 --> 00:38:05.973
Maybe I'll go up and have a hot tub,
soak for a while.


516
00:38:06.057 --> 00:38:08.725
That's a good idea.

517
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:11.478
Oh, I've used up all the hot water.

518
00:38:11.563 --> 00:38:14.481
That half-pint heater
really has to be babied.


519
00:38:14.566 --> 00:38:16.775
I'll order a big one tomorrow.

520
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:20.320
Why, Ed, we can't afford
another thing this year.


521
00:38:20.405 --> 00:38:22.906
Well, just fill a kettle.

522
00:38:22.991 --> 00:38:24.658
All right.

523
00:40:05.009 --> 00:40:06.802
One more kettle'll do.

524
00:40:08.596 --> 00:40:11.098
You're not in the hospital now!

525
00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.111
I...

526
00:40:24.195 --> 00:40:27.447
I'm sorry, but I just...

527
00:40:28.449 --> 00:40:31.159
I mu
-I must have been crazy.

528
00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:34.997
Please 
- Please forgive me.

529
00:40:35.081 --> 00:40:38.500
There's only one thing wrong...

530
00:40:38.584 --> 00:40:40.585
with both of us.

531
00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.007
We've been away from each other
too long.


532
00:40:45.091 --> 00:40:46.925
Yes!

533
00:41:08.239 --> 00:41:10.157
- Mommy!
- What's the matter, Richie?


534
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:14.745
It's Daddy.
He's down in the den, and he's crying.


535
00:41:15.788 --> 00:41:19.207
Go back to bed, darling.
Your daddy's been through a lot.


536
00:41:26.507 --> 00:41:28.759
Oh, Ed. Oh, Darling!

537
00:41:28.843 --> 00:41:31.094
My darling, what is it?

538
00:41:31.179 --> 00:41:35.599
It's nothing.
Look, I told you, please go away!


539
00:41:35.683 --> 00:41:38.498
You should have called me.
Is the pain back?


540
00:41:38.523 --> 00:41:39.710
Of course not!

541
00:41:39.771 --> 00:41:41.772
It isn't anything physical.

542
00:41:43.441 --> 00:41:45.692
I wish to God it were.

543
00:41:45.777 --> 00:41:48.028
I'll call Dr. Norton.

544
00:41:48.112 --> 00:41:51.615
- He'll send me back to the hospital.
- But shouldn't you go?


545
00:41:52.658 --> 00:41:58.372
I can't get sick again. What'll happen
to you and Richie if I fold up on the job?


546
00:41:58.456 --> 00:42:02.667
I'm not going to argue about this!

547
00:42:03.669 --> 00:42:08.340
Well - Well, let's go upstairs
and get some sleep then.


548
00:42:08.424 --> 00:42:11.426
We'll see how you feel in the morning.

549
00:42:22.105 --> 00:42:24.606
Some kind of a letdown is all.

550
00:42:26.317 --> 00:42:28.235
I'm sorry if I worried you.

551
00:42:28.319 --> 00:42:30.487
Oh, you'll be all right.

552
00:42:32.824 --> 00:42:35.742
You go ahead.
I'll be - I'll be right in.


553
00:42:35.827 --> 00:42:39.496
- Don't be long, darling.
- No.


554
00:43:11.946 --> 00:43:14.948
Hello?
Dr. Norton speaking.


555
00:43:16.534 --> 00:43:18.535
Hello? Who's calling?

556
00:44:34.904 --> 00:44:38.365
- Mm-hmm.
- What is it?


557
00:44:38.449 --> 00:44:40.367
- 128 over 80, Ed.
- Oh.


558
00:44:40.451 --> 00:44:43.870
It's fine. Still no periods
of depression?


559
00:44:44.956 --> 00:44:47.082
Just a little one first night home.

560
00:44:47.166 --> 00:44:50.418
- Mm-hmm. Nothing else?
- No, nothing at all.


561
00:44:50.503 --> 00:44:53.213
Well, we might as well
continue the present dosage.


562
00:44:53.297 --> 00:44:55.382
I'll need a new prescription.

563
00:44:55.466 --> 00:44:57.384
Hmm?

564
00:44:57.468 --> 00:45:00.512
Oh, you should have enough
to carry you another five days.


565
00:45:00.596 --> 00:45:03.515
- You didn't take more than I prescribed?
- No, my hands were wet.


566
00:45:03.599 --> 00:45:06.518
I dropped the bottle.
The whole lot ran down the drain.


567
00:45:06.602 --> 00:45:08.979
- You taking penicillin?
- Yeah.


568
00:45:09.063 --> 00:45:11.106
- Have any bad reactions?
- No.


569
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:14.484
Some people do.
Same with aspirin even.


570
00:45:15.778 --> 00:45:17.904
Now, cortisone...

571
00:45:17.989 --> 00:45:21.825
sometimes we see it produce
some pretty queer mental effects.


572
00:45:24.704 --> 00:45:27.247
- Oh, is there something else?
- No, no. Nothing at all.


573
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:29.666
- All right, I'll see you in 10 days, Ed.
- Bye.


574
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:31.251
Bye.

575
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:34.504
- Good-bye, Mr. Avery.
- Bye, Nurse.


576
00:45:49.353 --> 00:45:53.857
I'm not kidding, Wally. Every P.T.A. night
I wish I worked in a filling station.


577
00:45:53.941 --> 00:45:56.943
Come on.
Parents are no worse than kids.


578
00:45:57.028 --> 00:45:59.279
Ah, that's easy for you to say.

579
00:46:05.161 --> 00:46:07.495
Examples of their little hobbies...

580
00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.165
Butterflies, home weaving and so on...

581
00:46:10.249 --> 00:46:11.916
We call it sharing.

582
00:46:17.632 --> 00:46:23.470
Think of it, ladies and gentlemen - 100,000
schools like this from coast to coast.


583
00:46:23.554 --> 00:46:25.347
Every year whole forests are cut down...

584
00:46:25.431 --> 00:46:28.058
to supply the paper
for these grotesque daubs.


585
00:46:29.185 --> 00:46:33.563
And we coo over them as though
they were van Goghs or Rembrandts.


586
00:46:33.648 --> 00:46:36.900
I'm afraid Mr. 
Avery hasn't much faith...

587
00:46:36.984 --> 00:46:39.986
in the unspoiled instincts of childhood.

588
00:46:40.071 --> 00:46:42.447
Afraid? My dear lady...

589
00:46:42.531 --> 00:46:44.449
childhood is a congenital disease...

590
00:46:44.533 --> 00:46:47.243
and the purpose of education
is to cure it!


591
00:46:58.589 --> 00:47:01.508
I see my point of view
is new to many of you.


592
00:47:01.592 --> 00:47:05.762
But ask yourselves, how do we describe
the unfortunate individual...


593
00:47:05.846 --> 00:47:11.434
who carries his unspoiled
childhood instincts into adult life?


594
00:47:11.519 --> 00:47:15.271
We say he's arrested.
We call him a moron.


595
00:47:15.356 --> 00:47:17.190
Well!

596
00:47:17.274 --> 00:47:21.945
I'm not at all sure that I like to have
my daughter Louise thought of that way...


597
00:47:22.029 --> 00:47:23.947
and by her teacher!

598
00:47:24.031 --> 00:47:26.616
My dear lady, your Louise
is a charming little creature...


599
00:47:26.701 --> 00:47:30.120
but we must try to examine the problem
without prejudice or sentiment.


600
00:47:30.204 --> 00:47:33.957
The hard fact remains that your daughter,
at her present stage of development...


601
00:47:34.041 --> 00:47:37.293
is roughly on an intellectual par
with the African gorilla.


602
00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:42.382
It's, uh, getting pretty hot in here,
isn't it, Ed?


603
00:47:48.723 --> 00:47:50.849
Excuse me, sir.

604
00:47:52.393 --> 00:47:54.310
She's the president of the P.T.A.

605
00:47:54.395 --> 00:47:56.396
Oh, really?

606
00:48:00.067 --> 00:48:03.236
What, after all,
from the Stone Age to the present day...


607
00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:06.197
has been the greatest invention
of mankind?


608
00:48:06.282 --> 00:48:08.575
Has anybody got a match?

609
00:48:08.659 --> 00:48:10.618
Thank you.

610
00:48:13.789 --> 00:48:14.956
Fire?

611
00:48:18.002 --> 00:48:19.502
The wheel?

612
00:48:20.588 --> 00:48:22.338
Safety pin?

613
00:48:22.423 --> 00:48:24.257
The hydrogen bomb?

614
00:48:25.259 --> 00:48:28.595
No, ladies and gentlemen,
the alphabet.


615
00:48:28.679 --> 00:48:33.433
And persons like myself are required
to teach these poor, bewildered kids...


616
00:48:33.517 --> 00:48:36.352
to read by a system
of word recognition...


617
00:48:36.437 --> 00:48:41.149
as though the mighty English language
were a collection of Chinese ideograms.


618
00:48:41.233 --> 00:48:44.611
And then we're surprised when Junior
can't even wade through the comics.


619
00:48:44.695 --> 00:48:48.531
Some of us have been waiting
to hear this kind of talk, Mr. Avery.


620
00:48:49.533 --> 00:48:52.452
He's telling us we oughta
get back to the old three Rs.


621
00:48:52.536 --> 00:48:55.705
"The three Rs" -
That's just a catchphrase.


622
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:58.958
Before it's too late, we ought to
get back to the real fundamentals.


623
00:48:59.043 --> 00:49:02.128
And I'm not just talking
of primary education now.


624
00:49:02.213 --> 00:49:05.840
We're breeding a race of moral midgets.

625
00:49:07.676 --> 00:49:12.472
All this hogwash about "self-expression,"
"permissiveness"...


626
00:49:12.556 --> 00:49:14.808
"development patterns"...

627
00:49:14.892 --> 00:49:17.685
"emotional security"...

628
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:21.314
Security -
With the world ready to blow up.


629
00:49:21.398 --> 00:49:23.525
If the republic is to survive...

630
00:49:23.609 --> 00:49:26.110
we've got to get back to teaching
the good old virtues...


631
00:49:26.195 --> 00:49:29.906
of hard work and self-discipline
and a sense of duty!


632
00:49:31.742 --> 00:49:33.660
My friends, I tell you...

633
00:49:33.744 --> 00:49:38.039
we're committing hara-kiri
every day right here in this classroom.


634
00:49:38.123 --> 00:49:43.044
Mister, that young man
ought to be the principal of this school.


635
00:49:54.056 --> 00:49:55.515
I just can't figure it out.

636
00:49:55.599 --> 00:49:59.102
LaPorte and I sat up
half the night talking about it.


637
00:50:00.187 --> 00:50:02.730
- What did Bob think?
- Well, he asked me...


638
00:50:02.815 --> 00:50:06.192
if I didn't think
Ed was getting a little out of hand.


639
00:50:06.277 --> 00:50:11.364
So I said, Sure, but you have to
make allowances because he's been sick.


640
00:50:11.448 --> 00:50:14.284
Well, you're a fine friend,
talking to his boss behind his back.


641
00:50:14.368 --> 00:50:18.538
But, Lou, haven't you noticed anything
lately, like the way he talks?


642
00:50:18.622 --> 00:50:20.665
He just isn't the same guy.

643
00:50:20.749 --> 00:50:24.794
You know, uh, big shot.
He even looks bigger.


644
00:50:24.879 --> 00:50:28.423
Look, Wally -
Wally, mind your own business.


645
00:50:28.507 --> 00:50:32.635
No matter how close we are to the LaPortes
socially, Bob is still Ed's boss...


646
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.388
and we mustn't let him think
that Ed's still sick.


647
00:50:35.472 --> 00:50:37.765
He may force Ed to take a vacation.

648
00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:39.934
Do you have any idea
what that would mean?


649
00:50:40.019 --> 00:50:42.687
Just the cortisone Ed has to take
costs two dollars a day.


650
00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:44.689
That's $60 a month.

651
00:50:46.775 --> 00:50:48.735
Gee, Lou, you wouldn't think...

652
00:50:48.819 --> 00:50:51.905
a foot that big could fit
in a guy's mouth.


653
00:50:51.989 --> 00:50:55.533
I'm sorry, Lou. I -

654
00:50:57.745 --> 00:51:00.163
- Lou?
- Yes, darling.


655
00:51:00.247 --> 00:51:02.165
Surprised?

656
00:51:02.249 --> 00:51:06.419
Had the substitute take over.
Little white lies. And I had a headache.


657
00:51:06.503 --> 00:51:09.547
Lou, have I got an idea. I knew
something would come of it last night.


658
00:51:09.632 --> 00:51:12.759
The most revolutionary concept
ever to hit modern education.


659
00:51:12.843 --> 00:51:14.641
Whole series of
magazine articles.


660
00:51:14.666 --> 00:51:17.746
Will you be sitting up nights
pounding the old typewriter.


661
00:51:18.807 --> 00:51:21.142
- Hi, Ed.
- Wally just dropped by.


662
00:51:21.226 --> 00:51:24.103
So I see.
Why don't you get him a beer?


663
00:51:24.188 --> 00:51:26.814
- You know I don't drink, Ed.
- Oh, yeah.


664
00:51:26.899 --> 00:51:28.942
Mr. Muscle Beach.

665
00:51:29.026 --> 00:51:30.402
Well, isn't this nice.

666
00:51:30.427 --> 00:51:34.554
My old pal dropping by to entertain
the little woman while I'm at work.


667
00:51:34.615 --> 00:51:38.076
I suppose you fell into that habit
while I was in the hospital.


668
00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:41.746
I didn't notice your car outside
as I drove in.


669
00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:43.831
Well, I 
- I walked, Ed.

670
00:51:43.916 --> 00:51:46.751
Oh, of course. Exercise.

671
00:51:46.835 --> 00:51:48.753
That magnificent physique.

672
00:51:48.837 --> 00:51:50.755
By the way,
what were you talking about?


673
00:51:50.839 --> 00:51:53.925
- W-We were just chatting.
- What about exactly?


674
00:51:54.009 --> 00:51:56.177
You know, Ed, one thing and another.

675
00:51:56.261 --> 00:51:58.304
- What short memories.
- Oh, Ed.


676
00:51:58.389 --> 00:52:00.348
Yes, Ed!

677
00:52:02.559 --> 00:52:05.019
Oh, I started to tell you.

678
00:52:05.104 --> 00:52:08.356
A whole new vista
suddenly opened up.


679
00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:12.360
It's gonna take everything I've got.
But what a career. What a mission.


680
00:52:12.444 --> 00:52:17.073
It could lead to a completely new type
of television program for adults.


681
00:52:17.157 --> 00:52:19.534
It 
- It sounds fascinating.

682
00:52:19.618 --> 00:52:22.453
Is that what you told them
at the P.T.A. meeting?


683
00:52:23.789 --> 00:52:27.667
Oh, so you do remember
what you were talking about.


684
00:52:27.751 --> 00:52:30.837
Did you make a full report, Wally?

685
00:52:30.921 --> 00:52:33.256
I'm sure you did.

686
00:52:35.426 --> 00:52:37.010
Well...

687
00:52:39.096 --> 00:52:41.639
this will be a
wrench for both of us.

688
00:52:42.641 --> 00:52:46.477
But you must try to understand
that I couldn't possibly continue on here.


689
00:52:46.562 --> 00:52:48.730
This new project...

690
00:52:48.814 --> 00:52:51.941
I couldn't do it justice
in an atmosphere of...


691
00:52:52.026 --> 00:52:54.027
petty domesticity.

692
00:52:58.449 --> 00:53:00.450
A man's wife.

693
00:53:01.785 --> 00:53:05.788
The woman he expected to love
devotedly for the rest of his life.


694
00:53:06.915 --> 00:53:11.169
Then suddenly one morning,
you're free - released.


695
00:53:12.588 --> 00:53:14.922
- You've simply outgrown her.
- What?


696
00:53:15.007 --> 00:53:16.966
Quiet!

697
00:53:17.968 --> 00:53:20.303
The way things turn out.

698
00:53:20.387 --> 00:53:25.475
The way destiny imposes
its intentions at crucial moments.


699
00:53:25.559 --> 00:53:28.394
What perfect timing.

700
00:53:28.479 --> 00:53:31.773
Oh -

701
00:53:31.857 --> 00:53:33.941
Take it easy.

702
00:53:34.026 --> 00:53:36.903
You get on the
phone and call Dr. Norton.

703
00:53:36.987 --> 00:53:39.113
He'll put you in touch with a...

704
00:53:39.198 --> 00:53:41.115
- Well, you know, a psychiatrist.
- No!


705
00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:43.576
No, don't you dare say that!

706
00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:45.870
You're gonna keep kidding yourself, Lou?

707
00:53:45.954 --> 00:53:47.872
Kidding myself?

708
00:53:47.956 --> 00:53:51.667
If it gets around that Ed's in the hospital
again, this time with mental trouble...


709
00:53:51.752 --> 00:53:55.254
what do you think that's going to do
to a schoolteacher's career?


710
00:53:55.339 --> 00:53:57.840
Oh, I see.

711
00:53:59.009 --> 00:54:01.719
Yeah.

712
00:54:01.804 --> 00:54:04.263
I certainly had you figured wrong, Lou.

713
00:54:04.348 --> 00:54:06.724
Smart girl like you.

714
00:54:06.809 --> 00:54:08.893
Why don't you
carry the ball for a while?


715
00:54:08.977 --> 00:54:12.438
Get your old job back again
or something.


716
00:54:12.523 --> 00:54:16.109
Do you think Ed would let me go out and
earn a living while he's in the hospital?


717
00:54:16.193 --> 00:54:17.875
What are you gonna do then?

718
00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:21.138
Whatever he thinks he
wants - anything at all.


719
00:54:22.533 --> 00:54:24.951
- Look, Wally, you go back to the school.
- But, Lou...


720
00:54:25.035 --> 00:54:26.953
- You'll only disturb him.
- You heard him.


721
00:54:27.037 --> 00:54:29.622
- He said he was gonna leave you.
- Oh, that. That doesn't mean anything.


722
00:54:29.706 --> 00:54:32.625
He's not himself!
All that pain and worry.


723
00:54:32.709 --> 00:54:35.628
- Uh, go on.
- Okay.


724
00:54:35.712 --> 00:54:38.214
But if you need any help, you...

725
00:54:38.298 --> 00:54:39.799
Right?

726
00:55:05.576 --> 00:55:07.910
- Can I help?
- If you like.


727
00:55:07.995 --> 00:55:09.579
Thanks.

728
00:55:19.423 --> 00:55:21.632
You look tired.

729
00:55:21.717 --> 00:55:24.135
Why don't you take a nap
before you leave?


730
00:55:24.219 --> 00:55:27.722
We waste a third of our lives sleeping.

731
00:55:27.806 --> 00:55:31.809
Not content with that, we keep
running to the doctors for sleeping pills.


732
00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:38.107
They can afford to be lavish with life because
they have no conception of its value.


733
00:55:38.192 --> 00:55:40.234
All right.
They've reduced the mortality rate.


734
00:55:40.319 --> 00:55:44.614
They know how to keep us alive.
But they don't know why.


735
00:55:46.325 --> 00:55:49.202
- Hadn't you better wait until morning?
- It's probably never occurred to you...


736
00:55:49.286 --> 00:55:52.538
that the words "teacher" and "doctor"
mean the same thing.


737
00:55:52.623 --> 00:55:55.708
Unfortunately there are too many doctors
and not enough teachers.


738
00:55:57.127 --> 00:55:59.212
How long do you think
this new job will take?


739
00:55:59.296 --> 00:56:02.798
It's a lifework.
Can't you get that through your head?


740
00:56:02.883 --> 00:56:06.427
What a shame I couldn't have married
someone who was my intellectual equal.


741
00:56:09.306 --> 00:56:12.183
I suppose you'll send the manuscript here
so I can type it.


742
00:56:12.267 --> 00:56:14.560
- I'll hire a professional.
- Oh, but that's so expensive.


743
00:56:14.645 --> 00:56:16.645
There you go again.
Very thing I was talking about.


744
00:56:16.688 --> 00:56:21.776
The trivial - You just can't distinguish between
the trivial and the important, can you?


745
00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:24.237
- Where will you stay?
- Some hotel.


746
00:56:25.239 --> 00:56:30.159
Ed, I'll drive you around
so you can find a really nice place.


747
00:56:30.244 --> 00:56:33.120
You can keep the car,
if that's what's worrying you.


748
00:56:34.248 --> 00:56:36.165
I'll call a cab.

749
00:56:42.464 --> 00:56:44.507
Want to come over and play baseball?

750
00:56:45.509 --> 00:56:47.885
Okay. Then hurry up.

751
00:56:50.222 --> 00:56:52.348
Hi, Mom!
Anything to eat?


752
00:56:58.313 --> 00:57:00.231
Richie, shh.

753
00:57:03.527 --> 00:57:05.695
Richie, I want you to go over
to your daddy's school.


754
00:57:05.779 --> 00:57:09.031
Find your Uncle Wally and tell him
I have to talk to him right away.


755
00:57:09.116 --> 00:57:11.075
Okay, Mom.

756
00:57:16.081 --> 00:57:19.000
Hi, Dad!
What are you doing home?


757
00:57:21.211 --> 00:57:23.212
You better wash that face.

758
00:57:43.275 --> 00:57:45.234
I can't leave after all.

759
00:57:47.446 --> 00:57:50.573
A man's first obligation
is to bring up his own son.


760
00:57:53.577 --> 00:57:56.287
Sometimes we say more than we mean.

761
00:57:56.371 --> 00:57:58.331
I know.

762
00:57:58.415 --> 00:58:00.875
I think I'll go for a little ride.

763
00:58:00.959 --> 00:58:02.960
- Do you want me to go along?
- No, thanks.


764
00:58:03.045 --> 00:58:06.339
I have to think.
Gotta clear my mind.


765
00:58:06.423 --> 00:58:08.341
Want me to unpack your bags?

766
00:58:10.594 --> 00:58:12.553
Yeah.

767
00:58:12.637 --> 00:58:14.180
Might as well.

768
00:58:27.652 --> 00:58:29.612
Shall I take my bike?

769
00:58:30.864 --> 00:58:32.782
No, darling.
You don't have to go now.


770
00:58:34.576 --> 00:58:36.702
Now, come on.
Shall we raid the icebox?


771
00:58:46.171 --> 00:58:48.339
Get going, you stupid...

772
00:59:10.946 --> 00:59:13.322
Oh, I seem to have left
my prescription blanks in the car.


773
00:59:13.407 --> 00:59:15.324
Let me have one of yours, will you?

774
00:59:16.368 --> 00:59:18.327
Thanks.

775
00:59:19.579 --> 00:59:22.039
Are you a physician?

776
00:59:22.124 --> 00:59:24.542
If I weren't, I wouldn't be able
to write this, would I?


777
00:59:27.754 --> 00:59:30.548
If it would make you feel any better,
I can go get my bag.


778
00:59:35.345 --> 00:59:37.596
I guess this will be all right, Doctor.

779
00:59:37.681 --> 00:59:40.891
If you don't mind, I'm in a hurry.
My patient's right outside in the car.


780
00:59:40.976 --> 00:59:42.893
Periarteritis nodosa.

781
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:46.188
Yes, sir.

782
00:59:50.444 --> 00:59:52.361
I'm glad I dropped in.
I'm new here.


783
00:59:52.446 --> 00:59:55.322
- I like the way you do business.
- Thank you.


784
00:59:56.616 --> 00:59:59.577
Is the virus epidemic
keeping you busy, Doctor?


785
00:59:59.661 --> 01:00:01.620
Night and day.

786
01:00:01.705 --> 01:00:03.622
The birthrate's getting out of hand too.

787
01:00:03.707 --> 01:00:07.710
The birthrate -
Yes.


788
01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:13.757
This will be $50.
Doctor's cost.


789
01:00:20.891 --> 01:00:23.058
- Gosh, Dad. I'm winded.
- That's football.


790
01:00:23.143 --> 01:00:26.562
Come on, boy. Let's go.
You're center. I yell "hike."


791
01:00:26.646 --> 01:00:28.689
You run.
You count six and it'll be there.


792
01:00:28.773 --> 01:00:31.025
Ready? Hike!

793
01:00:38.575 --> 01:00:39.824
What'd you close your eyes for?

794
01:00:39.849 --> 01:00:42.185
You can't expect to catch a
pass with your eyes closed.


795
01:00:42.245 --> 01:00:43.746
I didn't.

796
01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:46.332
You flinched. I saw you.

797
01:00:47.334 --> 01:00:51.128
You don't think they gave
me this ball for flinching, do you?


798
01:00:51.213 --> 01:00:54.006
Every college in the East
had a scout there that day.


799
01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:59.094
Dad, football season's over.
All the other kids are playing baseball.


800
01:00:59.179 --> 01:01:00.971
- Richie.
- Yes?


801
01:01:01.056 --> 01:01:03.265
Are you satisfied with the way
you play football?


802
01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:06.435
- I'm as good as most kids.
- I know it's just a game.


803
01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.773
But if you back off now, if you let it go at "good
enough," that's the way you'll be later on.


804
01:01:10.857 --> 01:01:12.775
You want to be a man, don't you?

805
01:01:14.528 --> 01:01:17.112
All right.
Let's see you really get in there.


806
01:01:19.282 --> 01:01:20.783
Ready?

807
01:01:20.867 --> 01:01:22.785
Hike!

808
01:01:27.999 --> 01:01:30.376
You didn't even try that time.
You quit!


809
01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:32.378
I'm no quitter.

810
01:01:32.462 --> 01:01:34.380
Richie, I can't allow such behavior.

811
01:01:34.464 --> 01:01:37.216
For your own sake, I have to brace
you up with a little penalty.


812
01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:40.177
If you miss this next pass,
it's gonna cost you your lunch.


813
01:01:46.351 --> 01:01:49.853
This may seem hard to you, but later on
you'll look back and you'll thank me.


814
01:01:49.938 --> 01:01:51.897
All right? Ready?

815
01:01:51.982 --> 01:01:53.357
Hike!

816
01:02:26.683 --> 01:02:31.270
I'm sure if you send the check back through
it'll be all right, Mr. Byron.


817
01:02:31.354 --> 01:02:34.231
And if it's something
I don't know about...


818
01:02:34.316 --> 01:02:36.734
well, then I'll take
the dress back myself on Monday.


819
01:02:36.818 --> 01:02:39.612
And the bank will tell you
nothing like this has ever happened before.


820
01:02:39.696 --> 01:02:42.281
I'm sure it'll be all right,
Mrs. Avery.


821
01:02:42.365 --> 01:02:45.451
It's just that we've never
done business with you before.


822
01:02:45.535 --> 01:02:49.121
Well, I appreciate your attitude
very much, Mr. Byron.


823
01:02:49.205 --> 01:02:51.749
- It'll all be straightened out on Monday.
- All right.


824
01:03:06.431 --> 01:03:09.071
Wally, Ed's out in back.
You know, he - he's home now on Saturdays.


825
01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:11.018
I know, Lou.
But I just found out something.


826
01:03:11.102 --> 01:03:13.312
Lou, Lou, this is important.
You've got to listen to me.


827
01:03:13.396 --> 01:03:15.068
You haven't been talking
about Ed, have you?


828
01:03:15.093 --> 01:03:16.839
No, but I know what's
the matter with him.


829
01:03:16.900 --> 01:03:19.158
Good morning, Mrs. Avery.
Any cream today?


830
01:03:19.183 --> 01:03:21.177
Oh, just the usual.
Thanks, Andy.


831
01:03:21.237 --> 01:03:24.239
Here. Read this.
Go on! Read it.


832
01:03:24.324 --> 01:03:28.202
It's about cortisone. A lot of doctors
have been having trouble with it.


833
01:03:28.286 --> 01:03:32.081
"The most serious reported complication
of the treatment is psychosis.


834
01:03:32.165 --> 01:03:35.167
"In some cases,
major mental disturbances have occurred.


835
01:03:35.251 --> 01:03:38.671
"They have been most common in cases
of high dosage and prolonged treatment.


836
01:03:38.755 --> 01:03:42.174
The benefits of the drug must now be
weighed against its long-term dangers."


837
01:03:42.258 --> 01:03:44.218
See? That's what it is.

838
01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:48.347
- I see.
- What are you gonna do?


839
01:03:48.431 --> 01:03:50.516
Call Dr. Norton.

840
01:03:51.768 --> 01:03:54.853
- I'll go with you, Lou.
- Oh, no, Wally. I'll call you later.


841
01:03:54.938 --> 01:03:56.730
Oh, you're an angel.

842
01:03:57.732 --> 01:04:00.317
And furthermore, this isn't the first time
you've gone out of your way...


843
01:04:00.402 --> 01:04:03.696
to annoy me with
yourjingle-jangle in, jingle-jangle out.


844
01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:04.663
Why do you do it?

845
01:04:04.688 --> 01:04:07.181
I can't help it if the
bottles make noise.


846
01:04:07.242 --> 01:04:09.201
Don't lie to me.
It's deliberate.


847
01:04:09.285 --> 01:04:12.538
You're filled with envy and malice
towards me because I work with my mind...


848
01:04:12.622 --> 01:04:14.540
so you make it impossible
for me to concentrate.


849
01:04:14.624 --> 01:04:17.418
I wouldn't do a thing like that,
Mr. Avery.


850
01:04:17.502 --> 01:04:19.586
Why, you folks and me,
we've been real friend...


851
01:04:19.671 --> 01:04:22.214
Some mornings I even
take the boy with me on my rounds.


852
01:04:22.298 --> 01:04:24.550
Ask him.

853
01:04:24.634 --> 01:04:27.886
I said for you to wait outside.
Go and do as you're told.


854
01:04:33.643 --> 01:04:35.102
Now I give you warning.

855
01:04:35.186 --> 01:04:39.022
If this happens once more - once more -
I'll have your job for it.


856
01:04:39.107 --> 01:04:41.108
I'll call the president of your company.

857
01:04:41.192 --> 01:04:46.238
Look, Mr. Avery, I've been working for
this company since - since 11 years, see?


858
01:04:46.322 --> 01:04:50.409
A-And you can take a-and call the president
of the United States if you wanna!


859
01:04:52.537 --> 01:04:56.081
Oh, well, g-g-good-bye.
I'm sorry.


860
01:04:56.166 --> 01:04:58.584
I'll try not to disturb you, Mr. Avery.

861
01:05:01.838 --> 01:05:04.631
That's what I mean.
Listen to him.


862
01:05:10.805 --> 01:05:13.932
Ed, I want to talk to you.

863
01:05:14.017 --> 01:05:15.851
All right.

864
01:05:15.935 --> 01:05:18.937
You've been so erratic,
so unreasonable...


865
01:05:19.022 --> 01:05:20.939
as if you'd been drinking.

866
01:05:21.024 --> 01:05:24.109
But Wally found out why.
It's the cortisone.


867
01:05:25.695 --> 01:05:27.446
Oh.

868
01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:30.866
You've got to believe me.
You've got to stop taking it.


869
01:05:36.122 --> 01:05:37.706
Oh, my God!

870
01:05:37.791 --> 01:05:39.958
Yes?

871
01:05:40.043 --> 01:05:42.377
Did you forget
what you were going to say?


872
01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:46.298
I forgot.

873
01:05:47.342 --> 01:05:49.384
Wally knows, doesn't he?

874
01:05:49.469 --> 01:05:53.639
He knows that without cortisone
I'd be dead within the year.


875
01:05:55.433 --> 01:05:58.143
What sort of a fool
do you both take me for?


876
01:06:05.568 --> 01:06:09.947
Nine, four, 17. Hike!

877
01:06:10.031 --> 01:06:12.908
Hey, Jimmy,
wanna play football with me?


878
01:06:17.497 --> 01:06:19.498
Dr. Norton's office.

879
01:06:19.582 --> 01:06:22.960
Hello. Is Dr. Norton there?
This is Mrs. Avery.


880
01:06:23.044 --> 01:06:26.213
I'm sorry, Mrs. Avery.
Doctor is out of town for the weekend.


881
01:06:26.297 --> 01:06:28.632
Dr. MacLennan is taking his calls.

882
01:06:28.716 --> 01:06:31.260
Mrs. Avery.
May I connect you with him?


883
01:06:31.344 --> 01:06:34.346
No, it'll wait until Monday.

884
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:37.182
I'd rather talk to Dr. 
Norton personally.

885
01:07:11.134 --> 01:07:12.759
Richie.

886
01:07:13.761 --> 01:07:17.472
What is the common denominator
of six and five?


887
01:07:18.558 --> 01:07:21.143
Thirty? No, 20.

888
01:07:21.227 --> 01:07:22.769
No, 30.

889
01:07:23.897 --> 01:07:26.023
Why did you write "11 "?

890
01:07:26.107 --> 01:07:28.233
I don't know.
I guess I...


891
01:07:28.318 --> 01:07:30.694
You guessed?

892
01:07:30.778 --> 01:07:33.030
Take a fresh sheet.

893
01:07:34.657 --> 01:07:36.658
Ready?

894
01:07:38.161 --> 01:07:42.164
"A" and "B" are hired to cut wood...

895
01:07:42.248 --> 01:07:44.166
at 50 cents a cord.

896
01:07:45.335 --> 01:07:47.419
Write it down.

897
01:07:50.506 --> 01:07:55.636
"A" can cut a cord in six hours,
"B" in five hours.


898
01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.055
Now think.

899
01:07:58.139 --> 01:08:01.183
How long will it take them both
to cut a cord?


900
01:08:03.186 --> 01:08:05.646
They could do it faster
with a power saw.


901
01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:08.357
A power saw isn't the point.

902
01:08:08.441 --> 01:08:11.193
This is a problem,
quite a simple problem in arithmetic...


903
01:08:11.277 --> 01:08:13.195
designed to develop your mind.

904
01:08:13.279 --> 01:08:15.030
Understand?

905
01:08:15.114 --> 01:08:17.449
Very well then.

906
01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:20.035
Fifty cents a cord.

907
01:08:20.119 --> 01:08:22.913
Richie, don't you see? The 50 cents
doesn't - doesn't make any difference.


908
01:08:22.997 --> 01:08:25.207
Leave the 50 cents out,
and go on from there.


909
01:08:27.001 --> 01:08:30.087
Don't get flustered.

910
01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:32.756
Just use your reason calmly.

911
01:08:34.217 --> 01:08:37.135
We'll have dinner the moment
you've mastered this problem.


912
01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:45.519
- Ed, dinner's been waiting two hours.
- I'm sorry.


913
01:08:45.603 --> 01:08:48.814
- Richie ought to eat.
- I'm hungry too.


914
01:08:50.233 --> 01:08:53.318
Ed, Richie didn't even have lunch.

915
01:08:53.403 --> 01:08:56.029
Look at him.
He's falling asleep.


916
01:08:56.114 --> 01:08:59.658
- He's just a child.
- Lou, my profession is teaching.


917
01:08:59.742 --> 01:09:01.660
I happen to know something
about children.


918
01:09:01.744 --> 01:09:05.872
They're born bone lazy,
just as they're born greedy and untruthful.


919
01:09:06.874 --> 01:09:08.792
Aren't you expecting too much?

920
01:09:08.876 --> 01:09:12.337
The human brain, if properly developed,
is capable of doing 10 times the work...


921
01:09:12.422 --> 01:09:13.922
that'll ever be required of it.

922
01:09:14.007 --> 01:09:17.801
Lou, my concern is solely
for Richard's future.


923
01:09:17.885 --> 01:09:20.262
I'm prepared to sacrifice
everything to that.


924
01:09:21.264 --> 01:09:23.682
Any objection?

925
01:09:23.766 --> 01:09:26.601
No, Ed, I 
- I'm sorry I interfered.

926
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:32.107
Never a moment's peace.

927
01:09:48.374 --> 01:09:50.876
Keep at it.
I'll be right back.


928
01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:00.135
Richie. Richie! Drink this.

929
01:10:06.142 --> 01:10:09.770
I can't do it.
I hate him, Mom.


930
01:10:09.854 --> 01:10:12.814
- I hate him.
- Oh, Richie.


931
01:10:14.233 --> 01:10:16.610
Now, darling, listen to me.

932
01:10:16.694 --> 01:10:20.989
You've got to understand this,
just as if you were a grown person.


933
01:10:21.074 --> 01:10:23.867
Your father doesn't mean to act this way.
It's those pills.


934
01:10:23.951 --> 01:10:26.411
And if he stops taking them, he...

935
01:10:26.496 --> 01:10:28.872
His awful pain will return.

936
01:10:28.956 --> 01:10:31.374
Now, we wouldn't want that
to happen, would we?


937
01:10:31.459 --> 01:10:33.376
Gosh, no.

938
01:10:33.461 --> 01:10:36.296
So you and I must be very careful
not to upset him.


939
01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:41.635
Just keep on loving him with all our
hearts, no matter what he does.


940
01:10:41.719 --> 01:10:43.762
Now, we'll see
Dr. Norton on Monday.


941
01:10:43.846 --> 01:10:47.808
And you'll do everything you can
to help until then, won't you, darling?


942
01:10:47.892 --> 01:10:50.852
Sure, Mom.
I just didn't get it.


943
01:10:50.937 --> 01:10:53.271
Well, uh, finish your milk.

944
01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:08.703
Now wipe your mouth.

945
01:11:13.209 --> 01:11:15.627
- Finished?
- Not yet.


946
01:11:34.355 --> 01:11:35.939
Done?

947
01:11:36.023 --> 01:11:38.316
I... think so.

948
01:11:38.401 --> 01:11:40.318
You think so, huh?

949
01:11:46.659 --> 01:11:51.496
Two hours, 43 minutes...

950
01:11:51.581 --> 01:11:55.500
38 and 2/11 seconds.

951
01:11:55.585 --> 01:11:57.502
Good work, boy.

952
01:11:58.504 --> 01:12:00.755
Wasn't so hard after all, was it?

953
01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.383
I was just dumb, I guess.

954
01:12:03.467 --> 01:12:05.677
Go on. Time for dinner.

955
01:12:05.761 --> 01:12:07.929
Hey, Mom! Dinner!

956
01:12:32.663 --> 01:12:35.040
Lord, we thank thee...

957
01:12:35.124 --> 01:12:37.667
for the blessings
we are about to receive.


958
01:12:37.752 --> 01:12:39.252
Amen.

959
01:12:53.809 --> 01:12:56.186
Give me that pitcher.

960
01:13:02.401 --> 01:13:04.319
Give me that glass.

961
01:13:17.375 --> 01:13:20.877
How stupid to suppose
you could hide anything from me.


962
01:13:22.338 --> 01:13:27.300
Quite obviously one glassful
has already been poured out of this.


963
01:13:27.385 --> 01:13:30.845
- What became of it?
- I drank it, Daddy.


964
01:13:30.930 --> 01:13:34.766
It's my fault, Ed. I brought it
to him while you were upstairs.


965
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:38.728
Lou, it will be better for all of us
if you clearly understand one thing.


966
01:13:38.813 --> 01:13:42.691
I will not tolerate your attempts
to undermine my program for Richard.


967
01:13:42.775 --> 01:13:43.775
Yes, darling.

968
01:13:43.859 --> 01:13:47.070
Be good enough not to speak to me
in that hypocritical tone of voice.


969
01:13:47.154 --> 01:13:49.823
I see through you as clearly
as I see through this glass pitcher!


970
01:13:49.907 --> 01:13:52.492
If you imagine I'm gonna be fooled
by all this sweetness and meekness...


971
01:13:52.576 --> 01:13:54.327
"Yes, darling, no, darling"...

972
01:13:54.412 --> 01:13:56.579
You're even a bigger idiot
than I took you for.


973
01:13:56.664 --> 01:13:58.581
Let's clear this up once and for all!

974
01:13:58.666 --> 01:14:00.917
I'm staying in this house
solely for the boy's sake!


975
01:14:01.002 --> 01:14:04.129
As for you personally, I'm completely
finished with you. There's nothing left.


976
01:14:04.213 --> 01:14:07.299
Our marriage is over!
In my mind, I've divorced you.


977
01:14:07.383 --> 01:14:11.011
You're not my wife any longer.
I am not your husband any longer.


978
01:14:25.693 --> 01:14:28.069
"But the father said to his servants...

979
01:14:28.154 --> 01:14:31.197
"'Bring forth the best robe
and put it on him...


980
01:14:31.282 --> 01:14:34.993
"'and put a ring on his hand,
and shoes on his feet...


981
01:14:35.077 --> 01:14:38.163
"'and bring hither the fatted calf,
and kill it...


982
01:14:38.247 --> 01:14:40.165
"'and let us eat and be merry.

983
01:14:40.249 --> 01:14:43.293
"'For this my son was dead,
and is alive again.


984
01:14:43.377 --> 01:14:46.087
"He was lost, and is found.'

985
01:14:46.172 --> 01:14:48.340
And they began to be merry."

986
01:14:48.424 --> 01:14:53.595
First, that I may preach
the word of God truly...


987
01:14:53.679 --> 01:14:55.430
and you hear it...

988
01:14:55.514 --> 01:14:58.183
let us bow our
heads to him who said...

989
01:14:58.267 --> 01:15:02.771
"Whatsoever you ask the father in my name,
he will give it you."


990
01:15:25.461 --> 01:15:29.589
Of all the feeble-witted sermons it's
ever been my misfortune to sit through.


991
01:15:29.673 --> 01:15:32.092
Richie, why don't you
take the funnies upstairs?


992
01:15:32.176 --> 01:15:34.260
I'll look at 'em later.

993
01:15:34.345 --> 01:15:36.930
A man who couldn't earn a living
selling neckties...


994
01:15:37.014 --> 01:15:41.893
has the audacity to stand up
and talk ethics to 500 people.


995
01:15:41.977 --> 01:15:43.937
You better go change your clothes.

996
01:15:46.107 --> 01:15:48.858
Come down as soon as you're changed.

997
01:15:48.943 --> 01:15:50.944
Where are you going?

998
01:15:51.028 --> 01:15:52.946
To change my dress.

999
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:55.323
First, you didn't want
to wear it to church.


1000
01:15:55.408 --> 01:15:58.868
I like to see you in bright colors.
You're to keep it on.


1001
01:15:58.953 --> 01:16:00.370
All right.

1002
01:16:00.454 --> 01:16:03.998
If it weren't downright criminal,
it would really be funny.


1003
01:16:04.083 --> 01:16:04.854
What would, Ed?

1004
01:16:04.879 --> 01:16:07.192
Trusting the moral
guidance of our children...


1005
01:16:07.253 --> 01:16:11.005
to these sanctimonious stuffed shirts.

1006
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:13.425
Now I'll have to take all that on.

1007
01:16:13.509 --> 01:16:16.928
Well, dinner's in the oven.
I'd better go look.


1008
01:16:17.012 --> 01:16:18.930
Lou...

1009
01:16:19.014 --> 01:16:22.350
"Take no thought, saying,
what shall we eat?


1010
01:16:22.435 --> 01:16:23.977
"Or, what shall we drink?

1011
01:16:24.061 --> 01:16:26.354
Or, wherewithal shall we be clothed?"

1012
01:16:29.066 --> 01:16:32.610
The duty of children to parents,
and parents to children.


1013
01:16:32.695 --> 01:16:35.572
All that fuzzy-minded sentimentality.

1014
01:16:36.615 --> 01:16:38.783
Love?

1015
01:16:38.868 --> 01:16:40.785
Of course.

1016
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:43.830
It's built in.
Nature takes care of that.


1017
01:16:43.914 --> 01:16:47.333
But the first duty is to principle.

1018
01:16:47.418 --> 01:16:49.544
Where's that boy?

1019
01:16:49.628 --> 01:16:53.214
So much has to be reevaluated, explored.

1020
01:17:59.949 --> 01:18:02.283
Lou! Lou?

1021
01:18:04.537 --> 01:18:06.538
You'll be happy to know
you've won.


1022
01:18:06.622 --> 01:18:11.084
All my efforts have been too late.
In this house our son has become a thief.


1023
01:18:16.006 --> 01:18:19.259
...is to devote my entire efforts to...

1024
01:18:28.811 --> 01:18:31.062
- I've tried to do my best -
- Hello.


1025
01:18:31.146 --> 01:18:33.439
May I speak to
Mr. Wally Gibbs, please?


1026
01:18:33.524 --> 01:18:35.441
But if you flinch in power...

1027
01:18:35.526 --> 01:18:37.527
No, thank you.
I'll call him over at the LaPortes.


1028
01:18:37.611 --> 01:18:39.529
...household duties and steal and lie...

1029
01:18:39.613 --> 01:18:41.698
I'm not a liar! You are!

1030
01:18:41.782 --> 01:18:45.076
All that about being
such a big football player.


1031
01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.579
You were just a substitute.

1032
01:18:47.663 --> 01:18:51.332
And I'm gonna call Dr. Norton
to make you stop taking those pills!


1033
01:18:51.417 --> 01:18:53.668
I don't care if
your pain does come back!


1034
01:18:53.752 --> 01:18:56.796
I'd rather you were dead
than the way you are now!


1035
01:19:06.974 --> 01:19:08.891
Come out of there.

1036
01:19:21.113 --> 01:19:23.031
Get into your room.

1037
01:19:34.251 --> 01:19:37.045
You've done a bad thing.

1038
01:19:37.129 --> 01:19:39.047
I've got to think about it.

1039
01:19:41.842 --> 01:19:45.219
Vi - Vi, listen to me.
I'll be over as soon as I can.


1040
01:19:45.304 --> 01:19:48.306
But you tell Wally I have to see him.
It's terribly important.


1041
01:19:49.725 --> 01:19:53.978
"And so the Lord visited Sarah...

1042
01:19:54.063 --> 01:19:57.357
"and it came to pass after these things
that God did tempt Abraham...


1043
01:19:57.441 --> 01:19:58.941
"and said unto him, 'Abraham.'

1044
01:19:59.026 --> 01:20:01.152
"And he said, '
Behold, here I am.'

1045
01:20:01.236 --> 01:20:05.198
"And he said, 'Take now thy son,
thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest...


1046
01:20:05.282 --> 01:20:08.451
and get thee into the land of Moriah"'...

1047
01:20:08.535 --> 01:20:11.120
Where are you going?

1048
01:20:11.205 --> 01:20:13.956
Just over to the LaPortes.
I won't be long.


1049
01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:16.042
There's something
we have to talk about.


1050
01:20:16.126 --> 01:20:19.504
Vi isn't feeling well and she's all alone.

1051
01:20:19.588 --> 01:20:21.881
This is enormously more important.

1052
01:20:21.965 --> 01:20:24.133
Well, I'm sorry. It'll have to wait.
Vi needs me.


1053
01:20:24.218 --> 01:20:26.135
Please, darling.

1054
01:20:27.805 --> 01:20:29.514
All right.

1055
01:20:29.598 --> 01:20:32.517
- We must try to forgive each other.
- Forgive?


1056
01:20:32.601 --> 01:20:36.312
No, wait. About Richie -
This terrible thing that's happened to him.


1057
01:20:36.397 --> 01:20:39.232
No matter what's come between us, Lou,
you and I are still his parents.


1058
01:20:39.316 --> 01:20:41.234
Perhaps we're both to blame.

1059
01:20:41.318 --> 01:20:44.654
We must face this together,
try to think out what must be done.


1060
01:20:44.738 --> 01:20:46.489
- Done? But, Ed -
- Now let me finish!


1061
01:20:46.573 --> 01:20:49.200
Lou, ask yourself,
what's to become of him?


1062
01:20:49.284 --> 01:20:51.619
He's ignored all my teaching.

1063
01:20:51.704 --> 01:20:54.038
What future can we reasonably
see for him now?


1064
01:20:54.123 --> 01:20:58.501
Growing up into a man who feels himself
above the law, above ethics.


1065
01:20:58.585 --> 01:21:01.337
When we're no longer here to
restrain him, watch over him...


1066
01:21:01.422 --> 01:21:03.339
who knows what crimes...

1067
01:21:04.383 --> 01:21:05.925
Even murder.

1068
01:21:09.138 --> 01:21:11.097
Lou, our boy.

1069
01:21:12.766 --> 01:21:14.308
For his sake...

1070
01:21:14.393 --> 01:21:18.646
no matter how hard it must be for us,
we've got to save him from all that.


1071
01:21:18.731 --> 01:21:20.481
Now. Before it's too late.

1072
01:21:20.566 --> 01:21:23.234
Oh, Ed, I don't know
what you're talking about.


1073
01:21:23.318 --> 01:21:25.820
Look here.
It says...


1074
01:21:25.904 --> 01:21:28.531
"Take thy son Isaac,
whom thou lovest...


1075
01:21:28.615 --> 01:21:32.410
"and get thee into the land of Moriah;
and offer him there for a burnt offering...


1076
01:21:32.494 --> 01:21:35.121
upon one of the mountains
which I will tell thee of."


1077
01:21:35.205 --> 01:21:37.874
- Oh!
- "And Abraham rose up early in the morning...


1078
01:21:37.958 --> 01:21:42.211
"and took Isaac his son, and Clave
the wood for the burnt offering...


1079
01:21:42.296 --> 01:21:44.589
"and went unto the place
of which God had told him.


1080
01:21:44.673 --> 01:21:48.718
"Then on the third day Abraham lifted up
his eyes and saw the place afar off...


1081
01:21:48.802 --> 01:21:51.304
"and they came to the place
of which God had told him.


1082
01:21:51.388 --> 01:21:54.223
"And Abraham built an altar there
and laid the wood in order...


1083
01:21:54.308 --> 01:21:58.728
"and bound Isaac his son,
and laid him on the altar upon the wood.


1084
01:21:58.812 --> 01:22:02.148
"And Abraham stretched forth his hand...

1085
01:22:02.232 --> 01:22:06.360
and took the knife to slay his son."

1086
01:22:07.529 --> 01:22:10.031
But, Ed, you didn't read it all.
God stopped Abraham.


1087
01:22:10.115 --> 01:22:12.158
God was wrong.

1088
01:22:18.081 --> 01:22:20.625
Where is Richie now?

1089
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:23.419
In his room.
I told him to wait there.


1090
01:22:27.257 --> 01:22:29.383
Well, Ed, you've had...

1091
01:22:29.468 --> 01:22:31.385
time to think this thing out.

1092
01:22:31.470 --> 01:22:33.221
I haven't.

1093
01:22:33.305 --> 01:22:36.599
This seems very terrible to you,
doesn't it?


1094
01:22:36.683 --> 01:22:38.643
Yes, it does.

1095
01:22:41.063 --> 01:22:43.898
For you too.
Oh, Ed, look at you.


1096
01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:46.102
I know what's in your mind.

1097
01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.885
Here, in the same book it's
written, "Thou shalt not kill."


1098
01:22:50.113 --> 01:22:52.698
So, Richie remains innocent.

1099
01:22:52.783 --> 01:22:56.160
We take the guilt.
We incur the damnation...


1100
01:22:56.245 --> 01:22:58.162
in mercy to the boy.

1101
01:22:58.247 --> 01:23:01.707
Ed, your son - your little boy.

1102
01:23:01.792 --> 01:23:03.751
You love him.

1103
01:23:11.844 --> 01:23:15.429
Look at these.
His very first photographs.


1104
01:23:15.514 --> 01:23:17.431
Look at this one, Ed.

1105
01:23:17.516 --> 01:23:20.685
You're holding him in your arms,
s-so proud.


1106
01:23:20.769 --> 01:23:24.689
A-And this one. You're pushing him
in that awful secondhand baby carriage.


1107
01:23:24.773 --> 01:23:26.399
Now look, Ed.

1108
01:23:27.442 --> 01:23:29.443
- No, Ed, look. Look at his hair.
- Put it away!


1109
01:23:29.528 --> 01:23:31.529
We can't allow ourselves -

1110
01:23:31.613 --> 01:23:33.114
Let it ring!

1111
01:23:41.331 --> 01:23:44.292
Ed, how will we make it
seem like an accident?


1112
01:23:44.376 --> 01:23:47.503
Perhaps - Perhaps if we take him
out in the car...


1113
01:23:47.588 --> 01:23:49.130
Accident?

1114
01:23:49.214 --> 01:23:53.593
But I hadn't planned to go on living.
Do you?


1115
01:23:53.677 --> 01:23:56.846
There's nothing left for us
to live for now.


1116
01:23:59.933 --> 01:24:04.896
Ed 
- Ed, our - our own home.

1117
01:24:06.982 --> 01:24:09.942
Tomorrow, or the next day, when they -
When they come and find us...


1118
01:24:10.027 --> 01:24:12.653
None of us will know.

1119
01:24:12.738 --> 01:24:16.324
Oh, Ed! Ed!

1120
01:24:16.408 --> 01:24:19.619
Ed!

1121
01:24:29.004 --> 01:24:31.130
Oh, Ed. No, no. Not yet.

1122
01:24:31.214 --> 01:24:33.716
- Not yet!
- Now, Lou.


1123
01:24:34.843 --> 01:24:39.013
Ed 
- Ed, just -just one more thing.

1124
01:24:39.097 --> 01:24:41.057
Do you mind?
I know it's foolish of me.


1125
01:24:41.141 --> 01:24:42.892
Well?

1126
01:24:42.976 --> 01:24:45.436
Could - Could we go out together
one last time?


1127
01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:47.688
You know, the way we do
around the block.


1128
01:24:50.025 --> 01:24:51.525
All right.

1129
01:25:02.788 --> 01:25:07.249
- How far shall we walk?
- Oh! Just -Just to the corner.


1130
01:25:07.334 --> 01:25:10.628
- The corner with the police station?
- Ed! No! Ed!


1131
01:25:10.712 --> 01:25:12.632
No! Ed! No!

1132
01:25:12.714 --> 01:25:15.841
Richie! Run out the window! Richie!

1133
01:25:15.926 --> 01:25:20.721
Richie! No! Richie!

1134
01:25:20.806 --> 01:25:25.810
Richie! Richie, run! 
From your father!

1135
01:25:25.894 --> 01:25:30.064
Run, Richie!
Richie! Richie!


1136
01:26:01.263 --> 01:26:04.098
It's okay, pal.
Everything's gonna be okay!


1137
01:26:53.815 --> 01:26:55.983
No!

1138
01:27:32.521 --> 01:27:34.647
I'm sorry.

1139
01:27:34.731 --> 01:27:37.983
Some people work awful late, don't they?

1140
01:27:38.068 --> 01:27:40.861
Oh, Richie...

1141
01:27:40.946 --> 01:27:42.863
you oughta be in bed now.

1142
01:27:42.948 --> 01:27:44.865
What time is it?

1143
01:27:51.456 --> 01:27:53.374
Oh, Nurse...

1144
01:27:56.086 --> 01:27:58.379
Nurses are always in such a hurry!

1145
01:28:05.554 --> 01:28:10.474
Doctor, what is going on?
How is my husband?


1146
01:28:10.559 --> 01:28:13.310
I've just come from his room.
He's still under sedation.


1147
01:28:13.395 --> 01:28:15.563
Why isn't Dr. Norton back?
He said he would.


1148
01:28:15.647 --> 01:28:19.150
He's in your husband's room right now.
I suppose he didn't want to wake you.


1149
01:28:19.234 --> 01:28:21.152
Didn't want to wake me!

1150
01:28:21.236 --> 01:28:23.529
If there's any new development,
I'm sure he'll tell you.


1151
01:28:23.613 --> 01:28:25.213
But the thing I want to know...

1152
01:28:25.282 --> 01:28:28.284
- Dr. Norton, how is Ed?
- He's still under sedation.


1153
01:28:28.368 --> 01:28:31.912
Well, I know that. You've had him
like a dead man in there for over 30 hours.


1154
01:28:31.997 --> 01:28:34.832
- But how is he?
- Lou, you've been very brave up to now.


1155
01:28:34.916 --> 01:28:38.252
- Don't go to pieces.
- I am not going to pieces, sir!


1156
01:28:38.336 --> 01:28:41.172
I am Ed Avery's wife,
and I want to know what's happening to him.


1157
01:28:41.256 --> 01:28:44.133
Yes? For instance,
why all these sedatives?


1158
01:28:44.217 --> 01:28:46.656
I am not precisely an idiot!
What are you hiding?


1159
01:28:46.681 --> 01:28:47.493
Nothing.

1160
01:28:47.554 --> 01:28:49.471
Ed's in good physical shape.

1161
01:28:49.556 --> 01:28:51.515
Well, what's happening to him now?
Is he in pain?


1162
01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:54.268
- No.
- But?


1163
01:28:54.352 --> 01:28:57.521
We've kept him under sedation
to give him every chance to recover.


1164
01:28:57.606 --> 01:28:58.898
From what?

1165
01:28:58.982 --> 01:29:01.942
From the psychosis
induced by the cortisone.


1166
01:29:02.027 --> 01:29:06.697
He's had a deep, refreshing sleep, and we may
find him bright and alert any minute now.


1167
01:29:08.283 --> 01:29:10.701
- However -
- Yes?


1168
01:29:11.703 --> 01:29:15.706
Well, I can't promise you that he's going
to be the Ed that you've always known.


1169
01:29:15.790 --> 01:29:19.251
By that, I mean
that he may be psychotic.


1170
01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:23.631
You mean out of his mind?

1171
01:29:26.176 --> 01:29:31.263
Lou, I've always been frank with you,
and I'm not going to change now.


1172
01:29:32.265 --> 01:29:36.936
When Ed opens his eyes,
he may not recognize any of us.


1173
01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:39.813
I want you to
be prepared for that.


1174
01:29:39.898 --> 01:29:43.484
But if he can remember everything
that happened, and face it...


1175
01:29:43.568 --> 01:29:45.653
then he'll be all right.

1176
01:30:02.796 --> 01:30:05.965
Doctor, I want to look
on the brighter side.


1177
01:30:06.049 --> 01:30:08.008
By all means, Lou.

1178
01:30:09.719 --> 01:30:11.762
If he comes out of this...

1179
01:30:11.846 --> 01:30:14.473
I mean, the way
we all want him to...

1180
01:30:14.557 --> 01:30:16.475
What will you give him
instead of cortisone?


1181
01:30:16.559 --> 01:30:18.477
There is no instead, Lou.

1182
01:30:18.561 --> 01:30:20.938
Cortisone again.

1183
01:30:21.022 --> 01:30:24.942
It was only Ed's misuse of the drug
that brought about this condition.


1184
01:30:25.026 --> 01:30:29.738
This time it'll be in carefully prescribed
dosage, which you will have to supervise.


1185
01:30:29.823 --> 01:30:31.907
But if this drug is so dangerous...

1186
01:30:31.992 --> 01:30:34.201
All drugs are potentially dangerous.

1187
01:30:34.286 --> 01:30:37.705
Cortisone is the only thing
that could have saved his life, Lou...


1188
01:30:37.789 --> 01:30:39.456
and it'll do so again.

1189
01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:41.792
But it needs faith.

1190
01:30:43.753 --> 01:30:45.671
Do you have faith, Lou?

1191
01:30:45.755 --> 01:30:48.150
The patient in Room

1192
01:30:48.175 --> 01:30:48.990
Thank you.

1193
01:30:49.050 --> 01:30:53.220
Yes, I have faith, Doctor...

1194
01:30:53.305 --> 01:30:56.223
Faith in my husband...

1195
01:30:56.308 --> 01:30:59.018
in my son...

1196
01:30:59.102 --> 01:31:01.562
in the family we can be together.

1197
01:31:03.023 --> 01:31:08.569
And that is why I -
I want to stay close to him...


1198
01:31:08.653 --> 01:31:10.821
in his room...

1199
01:31:10.905 --> 01:31:14.199
at his bed, by his side...

1200
01:31:14.284 --> 01:31:18.954
so that when he opens his eyes
and sees us...


1201
01:31:19.039 --> 01:31:21.915
he'll know that we have faith in him.

1202
01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:25.878
Sure. That seems like
a reasonable request.


1203
01:31:57.952 --> 01:32:00.996
Turn out the sun!

1204
01:32:01.081 --> 01:32:05.292
- What?
- The sun. Turn it out. It's blinding me.


1205
01:32:05.377 --> 01:32:07.795
What sun?

1206
01:32:07.879 --> 01:32:10.839
The overhead light, you fool.
It's blinding me!


1207
01:32:19.349 --> 01:32:21.558
What's this?

1208
01:32:21.643 --> 01:32:23.602
Where am I?

1209
01:32:25.063 --> 01:32:28.732
- What's happened?
- You're in the hospital, Ed.


1210
01:32:30.527 --> 01:32:33.737
- I'm disappointed.
- About what?


1211
01:32:35.281 --> 01:32:38.826
You're a poor substitute
for Abraham Lincoln.


1212
01:32:40.620 --> 01:32:43.372
How do you mean that?

1213
01:32:43.456 --> 01:32:46.250
Mean what?

1214
01:32:46.334 --> 01:32:50.712
- You're not Abraham Lincoln, are you?
- No. No, I'm not.


1215
01:33:04.853 --> 01:33:06.812
Lou?

1216
01:33:08.022 --> 01:33:11.483
What's happened? What -
Was there an auto accident?


1217
01:33:13.278 --> 01:33:15.988
You sort of f-fell down the stairs.

1218
01:33:22.537 --> 01:33:24.538
Richie?

1219
01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:40.679
I was dreaming.

1220
01:33:43.016 --> 01:33:45.225
I walked with Lincoln.

1221
01:33:46.478 --> 01:33:50.105
He was as big and ugly...

1222
01:33:50.190 --> 01:33:52.274
and beautiful...

1223
01:33:52.358 --> 01:33:54.276
as he was in life.

1224
01:33:57.322 --> 01:33:59.239
Abraham.

1225
01:34:04.996 --> 01:34:06.580
Abraham!

1226
01:34:09.083 --> 01:34:12.169
Did I hurt you?
I tried to.


1227
01:34:12.253 --> 01:34:14.171
Are you all right?

1228
01:34:14.255 --> 01:34:16.340
I'm all right, Dad.

1229
01:34:16.424 --> 01:34:18.383
I remember now.

1230
01:34:23.223 --> 01:34:25.140
I remember everything that happened.

1231
01:34:25.225 --> 01:34:27.726
That's the way it should be, Ed.

1232
01:34:28.895 --> 01:34:31.063
It's important to remember.

1233
01:34:33.399 --> 01:34:37.027
Dr. Norton, will you leave me alone
with my wife and son?


1234
01:34:38.571 --> 01:34:40.489
Of course, Ed.

1235
01:34:52.377 --> 01:34:54.962
Oh.

1236
01:34:56.130 --> 01:34:59.883
I'm so far away from you.
Come closer.


1237
01:34:59.968 --> 01:35:04.137
- Closer. Closer.
- Ed, you'll have us both in bed.


1238
01:35:04.222 --> 01:35:07.558
That's what I mean. Closer.

1239
01:35:07.642 --> 01:35:09.142
Closer.
