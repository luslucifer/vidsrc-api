Hi.

37
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:53.594
Uh... hello.

38
00:05:53.627 --> 00:05:56.931
That's a real
sharp-lookin' outfit.


39
00:05:58.299 --> 00:06:01.269
What time is it?
My watch is on the bed table.


40
00:06:04.438 --> 00:06:07.441
- Ten to 12:00?
- No, no, it's 8:25.


41
00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:09.443
The stem is broken.

42
00:06:09.477 --> 00:06:12.413
It's three hours
and 25 minutes fast.


43
00:06:12.446 --> 00:06:14.582
Why don't you get it fixed?

44
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.087
I was going to,
but I got used to it.


45
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.156
Doesn't it mix you up?

46
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.327
No, I'm very quick with figures.
Oh.


47
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.297
Why are you looking
at me like that?


48
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.966
Why do you have to
look so luminous?


49
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.069
It would make things so much easier
if you woke up with puffy eyes...


50
00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:38.940
and blotchy skin
like everyone else.


51
00:06:38.973 --> 00:06:42.243
I guess God just figured that
chubby thighs were enough.


52
00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:45.980
Look, this isn't gonna just go away.
We have to talk about this.


53
00:06:46.014 --> 00:06:47.916
Okay.

54
00:06:52.086 --> 00:06:54.255
Where you going?
I wanna brush my teeth.


55
00:06:54.288 --> 00:06:56.257
Dorothy, sit down.

56
00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.028
Oh, by the way...
No, please, sit.


57
00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:02.096
Dorothy, in the first place,

58
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.166
I want you to know that what happened
last night was the most beautiful,


59
00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:07.535
wonderful, crazy thing
that's ever happened to me,


60
00:07:07.568 --> 00:07:09.437
and I'll never forget it or you.

61
00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:12.006
Doris.

62
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:15.476
What?
My name is Doris.


63
00:07:18.546 --> 00:07:21.049
Your name is Doris?
Yes.


64
00:07:22.483 --> 00:07:25.686
I've been calling you
Dorothy all night. I know.


65
00:07:25.719 --> 00:07:30.658
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I didn't know we were gonna end up...


66
00:07:30.691 --> 00:07:33.928
And then I did try and tell
you, but you weren't listening.


67
00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:38.499
When?

68
00:07:38.532 --> 00:07:42.036
It was right in the middle
of everything.


69
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.606
It was incredible, wasn't it?

70
00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:49.143
It was... nice.

71
00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:52.981
I mean, especially
the last time.


72
00:07:54.415 --> 00:07:57.085
I know, I'm an animal.

73
00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:00.955
I don't know what came over me.

74
00:08:00.989 --> 00:08:05.093
I mean, I was... what... Wait,
what was wrong with the first two times?


75
00:08:05.126 --> 00:08:08.729
Well, the first time
was a little fast.


76
00:08:08.762 --> 00:08:14.035
And, um, the second time...

77
00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:19.340
Listen, I really feel funny
talking about this.


78
00:08:19.373 --> 00:08:22.310
It was a very beautiful
thing, Doris.


79
00:08:22.343 --> 00:08:26.080
There was nothing ugly or
disgusting about what we did.


80
00:08:26.114 --> 00:08:28.616
Then how come you look
so down in the dumps?


81
00:08:28.649 --> 00:08:31.585
Because my wife
is going to kill me.


82
00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:35.389
Well, how's she gonna find out?
She knows already.


83
00:08:35.423 --> 00:08:39.027
- You said she was in New Jersey.
- It doesn't matter. She knows.


84
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.196
How?

85
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.999
Was it as incredible for you
as it was for me?


86
00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:49.103
Do all men like to talk
about it a lot afterwards?


87
00:08:50.504 --> 00:08:53.107
Why? You think I'm some kind
of a pervert or something?


88
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:55.109
Oh, no!
I was just curious.


89
00:08:55.143 --> 00:08:59.313
See, I was a virgin when I got married.
Well, at least sort of.


90
00:09:01.215 --> 00:09:03.384
Sort of?

91
00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:07.121
Well, I was pregnant,
but I don't count that.


92
00:09:07.155 --> 00:09:09.390
Doris, that counts!

93
00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:13.061
No, I mean it was by the man that
I married. Oh, I see. I'm sorry.


94
00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:16.730
Oh, that's all right. See, Harry and
me were gonna get married anyway.


95
00:09:16.764 --> 00:09:20.234
That just speeded things up
a little bit.


96
00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:25.306
It turns out I get pregnant if
we drink out of the same cup.


97
00:09:25.339 --> 00:09:27.775
What's the matter?

98
00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:30.378
Nothing.
I-I-I-I'm fine.


99
00:09:30.411 --> 00:09:32.380
I'm all right.

100
00:09:32.413 --> 00:09:34.748
Doris?
What?


101
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.287
I think I'm in love with you.

102
00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:47.628
I mean, it's crazy.
It's really crazy.


103
00:09:47.661 --> 00:09:50.364
I don't even know if you've
read Catcher in the Rye.


104
00:09:50.398 --> 00:09:54.135
Oh, no, I didn't even finish high school.
There. You see?


105
00:09:54.168 --> 00:09:58.072
I don't even care,
and I'm really a snob about education.


106
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.410
Of course, I should have
known this would happen.


107
00:10:02.443 --> 00:10:06.180
When it comes to life,
I have a brown thumb. What do you mean?


108
00:10:06.214 --> 00:10:09.783
I mean nothing I ever do
turns out right.


109
00:10:09.817 --> 00:10:13.121
First time... First time I had
sex, I was 18 years old.


110
00:10:13.154 --> 00:10:16.757
We were in the backseat
of a parked 1938 Dodge sedan.


111
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.727
Right in the middle of it,
we were rear-ended.


112
00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.596
Oh. And you didn't have
any insurance?


113
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.333
No, that's not exactly
what I mean. I mean...


114
00:10:25.366 --> 00:10:27.601
Oh.
Look, take last night.


115
00:10:27.635 --> 00:10:30.504
You know what the radio was
playing while we were making love?


116
00:10:30.538 --> 00:10:33.407
No. "If I Knew You Were
Coming, I'd Have Baked A Cake."


117
00:10:33.441 --> 00:10:36.310
So?
So that's gonna be our song.


118
00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.312
Is it?
No.


119
00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:42.183
I mean, other people would have gotten
"Be My Love" or "Some Enchanted Evening."


120
00:10:42.216 --> 00:10:46.520
Me, I get "If I Knew You Were
Coming, I'd Have Baked A Cake."


121
00:10:54.795 --> 00:10:57.265
What is it?

122
00:10:57.298 --> 00:11:00.434
I really want to
take a bath now.


123
00:11:00.468 --> 00:11:02.703
Oh, I'm so...
Oh, I see. I'm sorry.


124
00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:04.638
It's okay.

125
00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:10.544
Yeah. Okay. Oh, sure.
I'll... I'll wait out... I'll be out...


126
00:11:46.447 --> 00:11:47.815
Wow!

127
00:11:47.848 --> 00:11:50.451
We're in big trouble, Doris.
Huh?


128
00:11:50.484 --> 00:11:53.421
I really think I've fallen
in love with you.


129
00:11:53.454 --> 00:11:57.191
- You wanna know what kind of luck I have?
- Yeah.


130
00:11:57.225 --> 00:11:59.627
I'm happily married!

131
00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.795
Are you Jewish?

132
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:03.063
No.

133
00:12:03.096 --> 00:12:06.267
Then how come you feel so guilty?
Don't you feel guilty?


134
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:11.272
You kidding?
Half my high school became nuns.


135
00:12:11.305 --> 00:12:13.974
I guess the Catholics have
rules about this sort of thing.


136
00:12:14.007 --> 00:12:17.211
Oh, yeah, we have rules
about everything.


137
00:12:17.245 --> 00:12:19.580
That's what's so great
about being Catholic.


138
00:12:19.613 --> 00:12:21.849
You always know where you stand.

139
00:12:21.882 --> 00:12:24.985
I tell you, Doris,
I feel like slitting my wrists.


140
00:12:25.018 --> 00:12:28.522
- Are you Italian?
- What's with you and nationalities?


141
00:12:28.556 --> 00:12:31.692
Nothing.
You're just so emotional.


142
00:12:31.725 --> 00:12:34.562
I happen to be a C.P.A.
Oh?


143
00:12:34.595 --> 00:12:38.899
I could be as logical
as the next person. Oh.


144
00:12:38.932 --> 00:12:41.702
Well, you don't strike me
as the accountant type.


145
00:12:41.735 --> 00:12:44.638
It's very simple.
My whole life has been a mess.


146
00:12:44.672 --> 00:12:47.275
Figures always come out right.

147
00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:50.278
What are you?
Oh, I'm Irish.


148
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:53.947
Well, they're emotional. Why aren't
you yelling or crying or something?


149
00:12:53.981 --> 00:12:56.817
I did all of that before
in the bathroom.


150
00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.421
Crying?
Nope. Yelling.


151
00:13:00.454 --> 00:13:04.625
I didn't hear you.
I stuffed a towel in my mouth.


152
00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:07.495
I'm sorry.
It's all right.


153
00:13:07.528 --> 00:13:10.331
No sense crying over spilt milk.

154
00:13:10.364 --> 00:13:13.334
Yeah, you're right.

155
00:13:13.367 --> 00:13:16.504
How come we feel so terrible?

156
00:13:16.537 --> 00:13:20.408
Because we're two decent, honest people,
and this thing is tearing us apart.


157
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:23.277
I mean, I know it wasn't our
fault, but I...


158
00:13:23.311 --> 00:13:27.348
I keep seeing the faces of my children
and the look of betrayal in their eyes.


159
00:13:27.381 --> 00:13:29.883
I keep thinking
about my marriage vows,


160
00:13:29.917 --> 00:13:32.953
the trust my wife
has placed in me...


161
00:13:32.986 --> 00:13:36.957
and all the experiences
we've shared together.


162
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.293
And you know
the worst part of it all?


163
00:13:39.327 --> 00:13:41.495
What?

164
00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:46.066
While I'm thinking all this,

165
00:13:46.099 --> 00:13:48.602
I have this fantastic hard-on.

166
00:13:53.073 --> 00:13:56.043
I really wish
you hadn't said that.


167
00:13:56.076 --> 00:13:58.879
I'm sorry. I think we should be
totally honest with each other.


168
00:13:58.912 --> 00:14:02.049
It's not that.
It's that I have to go to confession.


169
00:14:09.022 --> 00:14:11.024
You know...

170
00:14:12.593 --> 00:14:15.329
W-We're both crazy.
You know that, don't you?


171
00:14:15.363 --> 00:14:20.501
I mean, this sort of thing happens
every day to millions of people.


172
00:14:20.534 --> 00:14:25.439
You don't use actual names in
confession, do you? No.


173
00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:37.651
Doris, may I ask you something?

174
00:14:37.685 --> 00:14:40.688
Sure.

175
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:43.391
Would you go to bed
with me again?


176
00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:45.793
Oh, George, I can't.

177
00:14:45.826 --> 00:14:48.862
Why not? 'Cause we'd just
feel worse afterwards.


178
00:14:48.896 --> 00:14:51.999
Oh, no. I'm over that now.
I just remembered something.


179
00:14:52.032 --> 00:14:54.568
What?
The Russians have the bomb.


180
00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:57.004
We could all be dead tomorrow.

181
00:14:57.037 --> 00:14:59.873
George, I think you're
clutching at straws.


182
00:14:59.907 --> 00:15:02.810
Doris, don't you understand?
No.


183
00:15:02.843 --> 00:15:05.679
We're two grown-up people.

184
00:15:05.713 --> 00:15:09.983
We have absolutely nothing
to be ashamed or afraid of.


185
00:15:15.823 --> 00:15:18.926
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!


186
00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:21.662
What are we gonna do?

187
00:15:21.695 --> 00:15:24.498
What are we gonna do?

188
00:15:24.532 --> 00:15:26.567
Uh... Coming!
My hat. My bag.


189
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:28.802
What?
My hat! My bag!


190
00:15:30.604 --> 00:15:32.606
Be right there.

191
00:15:34.508 --> 00:15:36.777
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Where are you going?


192
00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:42.750
Okay.

193
00:15:42.783 --> 00:15:45.619
- Don't go in the bathroom.
- Why not?


194
00:15:45.653 --> 00:15:48.922
That's the first place
they'd look.


195
00:15:48.956 --> 00:15:50.858
Oh!

196
00:15:57.731 --> 00:16:00.734
Oh, hello.
Oh, good morning, Mr. Peters.


197
00:16:00.768 --> 00:16:03.382
I've got your breakfast.
Did you have a good night?


198
00:16:03.407 --> 00:16:04.438
Yes. Fine, fine.

199
00:16:04.472 --> 00:16:08.175
Uh, y-you know,
I think I heard an owl out here.


200
00:16:23.223 --> 00:16:27.828
I'm a C.P.A. When you work hard all
year, it's great to get back to nature.


201
00:16:27.861 --> 00:16:30.531
I really loved it.
That's right.


202
00:16:30.564 --> 00:16:34.134
Well, thank you, Mr. Chalmers.
You're welcome.


203
00:16:34.167 --> 00:16:36.504
Have a nice day, now.
Thank you. You too.


204
00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:37.271
Enjoy the view.

205
00:16:37.296 --> 00:16:39.497
Yes, I will.
I'll just wander around by myself.


206
00:16:45.145 --> 00:16:47.080
Doris?

207
00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:53.521
Doris?

208
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:59.893
Have you got a woman in there?

209
00:17:01.762 --> 00:17:05.533
It's okay. It was old
Mr. Chalmers with my breakfast.


210
00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:09.169
I was very calm. He didn't suspect a thing.
He didn't ask about the girdle.


211
00:17:09.202 --> 00:17:12.072
- What?
- Girdle.


212
00:17:14.608 --> 00:17:16.677
Oh, great!

213
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:19.012
Now he probably thinks I'm a homo.
Oh, well.


214
00:17:19.046 --> 00:17:22.550
What do you care?
I stay here every year.


215
00:17:22.583 --> 00:17:24.818
Oh, yeah? How come?

216
00:17:24.852 --> 00:17:27.688
I have a friend who went into
the wine business near here.


217
00:17:27.721 --> 00:17:32.092
I fly out the same weekend every year
to do his books. From New Jersey?


218
00:17:32.125 --> 00:17:34.862
He was my first client.
It's sort of a sentimental thing.


219
00:17:34.895 --> 00:17:36.797
Oh, I see.

220
00:17:40.133 --> 00:17:43.637
Uh, Doris, I'd like to
tell you something. Okay.


221
00:17:43.671 --> 00:17:46.640
You probably think I do this
sort of thing all the time.


222
00:17:46.674 --> 00:17:50.210
I know I must appear very
smooth and glib and sexual.


223
00:17:50.243 --> 00:17:54.582
But since I've been married, this is
the very first time I've done this.


224
00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:59.687
Ah, sure. Don't worry.
I could tell.


225
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.156
Listen, would you mind if I
had a little of your breakfast?


226
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:06.159
Sure. I'm not hungry. Thank you.

227
00:18:06.193 --> 00:18:10.731
Even when I was single, I was no
good at quick, superficial affairs.


228
00:18:10.764 --> 00:18:13.734
I always had to like the person...
What do you mean, you could tell?


229
00:18:13.767 --> 00:18:17.304
- In what way could you tell?
- What? Oh.


230
00:18:17.337 --> 00:18:19.573
Uh, well, it was
just little things,


231
00:18:19.607 --> 00:18:22.976
you know, like when you tried to take
your pants off over your shoes...


232
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.814
and t... tripped and hit your
head on the coffee table.


233
00:18:26.847 --> 00:18:29.549
Just little things like that.

234
00:18:32.219 --> 00:18:35.355
It's great to be totally honest
with another person, isn't it?


235
00:18:35.388 --> 00:18:37.725
It sure is.

236
00:18:37.758 --> 00:18:40.728
Doris, I haven't been totally
honest with you. You haven't?


237
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.708
I told you I was a married
man with two children.


238
00:18:45.733 --> 00:18:46.758
You're not?

239
00:18:48.201 --> 00:18:50.738
I'm a married man
with three children.


240
00:18:53.373 --> 00:18:56.710
I thought it would make me
seem less married.


241
00:18:56.744 --> 00:19:00.380
All right, I didn't think it
through, all right?


242
00:19:00.413 --> 00:19:04.351
There's been like a lead weight
inside me all morning.


243
00:19:04.384 --> 00:19:07.354
I mean,
denying little Debbie like that!


244
00:19:10.758 --> 00:19:13.961
I was under a certain stress
or I wouldn't have done it.


245
00:19:13.994 --> 00:19:17.731
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Y-You understand?


246
00:19:17.765 --> 00:19:21.702
Sure. We all do
dopey things sometimes.


247
00:19:26.674 --> 00:19:29.810
Well...

248
00:19:29.843 --> 00:19:32.646
I really should be going.

249
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:35.716
The nuns are gonna be wondering
what happened to me.


250
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.257
Nuns?
Did you say nuns?


251
00:19:44.291 --> 00:19:47.895
Yeah, somehow it just didn't seem
right to bring up last night,


252
00:19:47.928 --> 00:19:52.099
but I was on my way to retreat.

253
00:19:52.132 --> 00:19:54.267
Retreat?
Yeah.


254
00:19:54.301 --> 00:19:56.269
See, it's right near here.

255
00:19:56.303 --> 00:20:00.007
I go every year at this time when
Harry takes the kids to Bakersfield.


256
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:02.342
What's in Bakersfield?
His mother.


257
00:20:02.375 --> 00:20:04.344
It's her birthday.

258
00:20:04.377 --> 00:20:08.148
Doesn't she mind that you don't go?
No, she hates me.


259
00:20:08.181 --> 00:20:11.919
'Cause I got pregnant.
Her son had something to do with that.


260
00:20:11.952 --> 00:20:14.988
Yeah, she blocks that
out of her mind.


261
00:20:15.022 --> 00:20:17.758
See, he was in his first
year of dental college...


262
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:21.762
and he had to quit and take a
job selling waterless cooking.


263
00:20:21.795 --> 00:20:25.198
So now every year on her
birthday, I just go on retreat.


264
00:20:25.232 --> 00:20:27.200
To think about God?

265
00:20:27.234 --> 00:20:30.804
Well, him too, sure,
but also about myself...


266
00:20:30.838 --> 00:20:34.775
'cause, see, I got pregnant
when I was just 18,


267
00:20:34.808 --> 00:20:38.245
so I've never really
had any time to just think.


268
00:20:38.278 --> 00:20:41.048
You know, I mean, about,

269
00:20:41.081 --> 00:20:43.951
well, what I think about.

270
00:20:45.285 --> 00:20:48.188
Never mind.
I don't know what I'm trying to say.


271
00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:51.825
Sometimes I think I'm crazy.
Why?


272
00:20:51.859 --> 00:20:55.328
Oh. Well,

273
00:20:55.362 --> 00:20:57.865
okay, like, take my life.

274
00:20:57.898 --> 00:21:02.736
Now, we live in a two-bedroom
duplex in downtown Oakland,


275
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.239
and we have a 1948 Studebaker,

276
00:21:06.273 --> 00:21:08.909
a blond, three-piece
dinette set,


277
00:21:08.942 --> 00:21:10.911
Motorola TV.

278
00:21:10.944 --> 00:21:13.747
We go bowling
at least once a week.


279
00:21:13.781 --> 00:21:16.850
I mean, what more
could anyone ask for?


280
00:21:16.884 --> 00:21:19.787
But sometimes...

281
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.922
things get me down.

282
00:21:21.955 --> 00:21:25.025
Oh, I don't know.
It's dumb.


283
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.831
I don't think it's dumb.

284
00:21:30.864 --> 00:21:33.200
You don't?
No.


285
00:21:35.969 --> 00:21:40.440
You know, I can really
talk to you.


286
00:21:40.473 --> 00:21:42.442
It's just amazing.

287
00:21:42.475 --> 00:21:46.880
I find myself saying things to you
that I didn't even know I thought.


288
00:21:46.914 --> 00:21:49.950
I noticed that yesterday right
after we met in the restaurant.


289
00:21:49.983 --> 00:21:52.519
We had instant rapport.
Did you notice that too?


290
00:21:52.552 --> 00:21:56.790
No, but I know
we really hit it off.


291
00:21:56.824 --> 00:22:00.293
See, Harry's not much
of a talker, you know.


292
00:22:00.327 --> 00:22:03.763
How 'bout your wife?
Do you two get to talk a lot?


293
00:22:06.433 --> 00:22:09.302
Uh... Uh, Doris,
it's only natural...


294
00:22:09.336 --> 00:22:12.372
that we should be curious about
each other's husband and wife,


295
00:22:12.405 --> 00:22:15.542
but-but rather than dwelling on it
and letting it spoil everything,


296
00:22:15.575 --> 00:22:17.978
why... why don't we...
Why don't we do this?


297
00:22:18.011 --> 00:22:19.880
I'll tell you two stories
about my wife...


298
00:22:19.913 --> 00:22:23.183
One showing the worst side of her,
the other showing the best side of her.


299
00:22:23.216 --> 00:22:26.019
You do the same thing about your
husband, and then let's forget it.


300
00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:28.021
Okay.
I'll go first.


301
00:22:28.055 --> 00:22:30.057
I'll start with the worst side.
Okay.


302
00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:34.394
Phyllis knows about us. Oh,
you said that before. How could she know?


303
00:22:34.427 --> 00:22:38.065
She's got this thing in her head!
Like a plate?


304
00:22:38.098 --> 00:22:42.936
A plate?
Oh, my uncle has one of those.


305
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.838
He was wounded in the war,

306
00:22:44.872 --> 00:22:47.941
and they put this steel
plate in his head.


307
00:22:47.975 --> 00:22:52.012
Now he says he can always
tell when it's going to rain.


308
00:22:54.948 --> 00:22:57.550
I'm in big trouble, Doris.
Why?


309
00:22:57.584 --> 00:23:01.021
Because I find everything you
say absolutely fascinating.


310
00:23:01.054 --> 00:23:04.992
Come on! Tell me about
your wife's steel plate.


311
00:23:05.025 --> 00:23:09.462
No, no, it's not a plate.
It's more like a bell. A bell.


312
00:23:09.496 --> 00:23:10.825
I could be a million miles away.

313
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:13.200
If I look at another woman,
it goes off like an alarm.


314
00:23:13.233 --> 00:23:15.202
Oh, I see.

315
00:23:15.235 --> 00:23:19.907
I just know that last night at exactly

316
00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.977
with her head going ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!


317
00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:25.645
How do you know it was 1:22?

318
00:23:25.678 --> 00:23:28.982
Because I have peripheral vision,
and I noticed my watch said 4:47.


319
00:23:29.016 --> 00:23:31.919
Oh.

320
00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:35.989
Well, okay, now, tell me,
um, something nice about her.


321
00:23:39.626 --> 00:23:42.629
Well... she made me
believe in myself.


322
00:23:44.531 --> 00:23:48.668
It's probably hard for you to imagine this,
but there was a time I was very insecure.


323
00:23:48.701 --> 00:23:53.173
How did she do that... make
you believe in yourself?


324
00:23:53.206 --> 00:23:55.175
She married me.

325
00:23:55.208 --> 00:23:58.378
Oh. Yes, well, that was
very nice of her.


326
00:23:58.411 --> 00:24:01.949
Oh, no, no, no. I meant bolstering
you up and all, you know?


327
00:24:01.982 --> 00:24:05.252
Okay, your turn.
Tell me the worst story first.


328
00:24:05.285 --> 00:24:07.154
Okay. Um...

329
00:24:10.023 --> 00:24:12.292
Ooh, this is hard.
To pick one?


330
00:24:12.325 --> 00:24:14.394
No, to think of one.

331
00:24:14.427 --> 00:24:18.031
See, Harry's the salt of the earth.
Everybody says so.


332
00:24:18.065 --> 00:24:21.101
Look, you owe me
at least one rotten story.


333
00:24:21.134 --> 00:24:22.970
Oh, okay.

334
00:24:23.003 --> 00:24:26.439
Uh...

335
00:24:26.473 --> 00:24:30.610
Well, I don't know.
This isn't really rotten, but... Okay?


336
00:24:30.643 --> 00:24:32.679
All right.

337
00:24:32.712 --> 00:24:36.116
Now, this was on
our fourth anniversary.


338
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:39.186
We decided that we'd have some
people over to help celebrate.


339
00:24:39.219 --> 00:24:42.222
So Harry doesn't usually drink,

340
00:24:42.255 --> 00:24:46.293
but that night
he had three beers.


341
00:24:46.326 --> 00:24:48.695
It was after
the Gillette fights.


342
00:24:51.064 --> 00:24:54.367
Well, I just overheard him
talking to some of the guys,


343
00:24:54.401 --> 00:24:56.503
and he said that his...

344
00:24:56.536 --> 00:25:00.007
His time in the army were
the best years of his life.


345
00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:05.045
What's wrong with that? A lot of
guys feel that way about the service.


346
00:25:05.078 --> 00:25:07.014
Harry was in the army
for four years,


347
00:25:07.047 --> 00:25:10.350
and three of 'em were spent
in a Japanese prison camp!


348
00:25:14.087 --> 00:25:17.224
Okay. Now do you want to hear the
story about the good side of him?


349
00:25:17.257 --> 00:25:19.559
Not particularly.
Aw, come on. You have to.


350
00:25:19.592 --> 00:25:23.030
I don't want you to get the wrong
impression of him. Okay, if you insist.


351
00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:25.665
I do. Okay.

352
00:25:25.698 --> 00:25:29.136
Harry's this, like, big,
heavyset kind of guy, you know...


353
00:25:29.169 --> 00:25:31.771
I really wish you hadn't
told me that. Why?


354
00:25:31.804 --> 00:25:35.408
Oh! No, don't worry.
He's gentle as a puppy.


355
00:25:35.442 --> 00:25:38.645
Anyway, uh, last year
he got this great idea...


356
00:25:38.678 --> 00:25:41.214
that he'd take Tony out
to fly a kite.


357
00:25:41.248 --> 00:25:43.216
See, Tony's our four-year-old.

358
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:47.020
And so they went out to the park to
fly a kite, but there wasn't any wind.


359
00:25:47.054 --> 00:25:51.058
So it's about an hour later, and I was
on my way home from the laundromat.


360
00:25:51.091 --> 00:25:53.060
I passed by...

361
00:25:53.093 --> 00:25:56.296
and I see Tony
sound asleep in the car.


362
00:25:56.329 --> 00:25:58.398
I look out in the park.

363
00:25:58.431 --> 00:26:01.268
There's Harry all alone
in the park,


364
00:26:01.301 --> 00:26:03.703
all red in the face
and out of breath,


365
00:26:03.736 --> 00:26:06.339
and he's just pounding
up and down...


366
00:26:06.373 --> 00:26:11.111
with this huge kite dragging
on the ground behind him.


367
00:26:12.812 --> 00:26:16.516
Oh, I don't know.
It just really got to me.


368
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:18.818
Yeah, I know.

369
00:26:18.851 --> 00:26:22.155
Helen has some nice qualities too.
Who's Helen?


370
00:26:22.189 --> 00:26:24.224
My wife.

371
00:26:24.257 --> 00:26:26.793
You said her name was Phyllis.

372
00:26:29.329 --> 00:26:32.532
No, I lied.

373
00:26:32.565 --> 00:26:35.768
Phyllis! Helen!
What's the difference? I'm married!


374
00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:39.106
Look, I was nervous. I was afraid
you'd try to look me up or something.


375
00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:42.509
I didn't want to
leave any clues.


376
00:26:42.542 --> 00:26:46.413
Is your name really George?
Well, of course it is.


377
00:26:46.446 --> 00:26:49.649
You think I'd lie
about my own name?


378
00:26:49.682 --> 00:26:53.220
Yes.
That would be crazy!


379
00:26:54.254 --> 00:26:57.257
Well, you're pretty crazy.

380
00:27:02.262 --> 00:27:04.063
It's funny, isn't it?

381
00:27:05.565 --> 00:27:09.202
Here we are in a hotel room,
gazing into each other's eyes.


382
00:27:09.236 --> 00:27:14.174
We're both married,
and we have six kids between us.


383
00:27:14.207 --> 00:27:17.076
Do you have any pictures?

384
00:27:18.478 --> 00:27:20.613
What?
Pictures of your kids.


385
00:27:20.647 --> 00:27:23.550
Yeah, but I don't think
this is the time or place.


386
00:27:23.583 --> 00:27:27.387
Come on, come on.
If you show me yours, I'll show you mine.


387
00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.424
I keep mine in this little
folder we got free from Kodak.


388
00:27:31.458 --> 00:27:34.627
Where's yours?
You have to take the whole wallet.


389
00:27:41.434 --> 00:27:43.536
Ahh!

390
00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.206
Ohh.

391
00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:49.409
Is that the oldest one with
the glasses and baggy tights?


392
00:27:49.442 --> 00:27:52.479
Yeah, that's Michael.
Funny-looking kid, isn't he?


393
00:27:52.512 --> 00:27:55.782
No. What does he
wanna be, Superman?


394
00:27:55.815 --> 00:27:58.151
No, Peter Pan.

395
00:27:58.185 --> 00:27:59.886
I'm kinda worried about him.

396
00:28:02.289 --> 00:28:04.857
Why is this one's face
all scrunched up?


397
00:28:04.891 --> 00:28:07.427
That's Paul.
That was taken on a roller coaster.


398
00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.596
Isn't it natural looking?

399
00:28:09.629 --> 00:28:12.865
Right after that he threw up.

400
00:28:12.899 --> 00:28:15.902
Yeah, he's really, um...

401
00:28:15.935 --> 00:28:18.438
I guess he... I guess
he takes after Harry.


402
00:28:18.471 --> 00:28:20.407
No, both of us, really.

403
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.911
What's your little girl's name?
Debbie.


404
00:28:24.944 --> 00:28:27.680
That was on her second birthday. We were
trying to get her to blow out the candles.


405
00:28:27.714 --> 00:28:32.552
She's got her hand in the cake.
Neat is not her strong suit.


406
00:28:34.487 --> 00:28:36.556
Ohh.

407
00:28:36.589 --> 00:28:39.292
You have great-looking
kids, George.


408
00:28:39.326 --> 00:28:41.361
Thank you.
So do you.


409
00:28:41.394 --> 00:28:43.296
Thank you.

410
00:29:24.771 --> 00:29:28.775
Okay, but this is the last time.

Happy anniversary, darling.

438
00:31:16.048 --> 00:31:19.619
Blow out the candles and make a wish.
All right.


439
00:31:21.854 --> 00:31:25.725
What'd you wish?
I only have one wish.


440
00:31:25.758 --> 00:31:28.761
What? That you keep on
showing up here every year.


441
00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:33.933
What?
You hate my hair, don't you?


442
00:31:33.966 --> 00:31:36.469
I told you, I love your hair.
Really?


443
00:31:36.503 --> 00:31:41.474
I don't know. Next time I'm going
to go into the city to get it done.


444
00:31:41.508 --> 00:31:44.844
How are the suburbs?
Oh, muddy, mostly.


445
00:31:44.877 --> 00:31:48.715
Right now everyone's
very excited.


446
00:31:48.748 --> 00:31:52.519
Next week they're gonna
connect the sewers.


447
00:31:56.889 --> 00:32:01.894
It's not exactly the life of Scott
and Zelda, but we're surviving.


448
00:32:01.928 --> 00:32:04.464
Uh, let's go over there.

449
00:32:04.497 --> 00:32:07.700
Scott and Zelda, huh?
You started reading.


450
00:32:07.734 --> 00:32:09.902
Oh, you don't know
the half of it.


451
00:32:09.936 --> 00:32:12.839
I've joined the Book of the Month Club.
Good for you!


452
00:32:12.872 --> 00:32:16.476
Sometimes I even take
the alternate selections.


453
00:32:16.509 --> 00:32:19.979
Thank you.

454
00:32:20.012 --> 00:32:22.148
Good evening,
Mr. Peters, ma'am.


455
00:32:22.181 --> 00:32:24.183
Hello, Mr. Chalmers.
Nice to see you again.


456
00:32:24.216 --> 00:32:26.118
Good to be back.

457
00:32:31.558 --> 00:32:34.494
Well, how 'bout you?
Are you still in New Jersey?


458
00:32:34.527 --> 00:32:36.496
No. We moved to Connecticut.
Really?


459
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:40.166
We bought a barn and converted it.
Oh, what's it like?


460
00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:42.969
Drafty.

461
00:32:43.002 --> 00:32:46.038
Helen's got
the decorating bug now.


462
00:32:46.072 --> 00:32:48.575
I have this mental picture
of her at my funeral,


463
00:32:48.608 --> 00:32:51.844
as they're closing the lid to my coffin,
throwing in two fabric swatches...


464
00:32:51.878 --> 00:32:56.683
and yelling out,
"Which one do you like?"


465
00:32:56.716 --> 00:33:00.753
That's the bad story about her.
What else is new?


466
00:33:00.787 --> 00:33:02.755
Oh, how's Michael?

467
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:06.092
Crazy as ever.

468
00:33:06.125 --> 00:33:09.862
He had this homework assignment to write
about what he did on his summer vacation.


469
00:33:09.896 --> 00:33:12.699
Trouble was,
he wrote what he actually did. What?


470
00:33:12.732 --> 00:33:14.867
Tried to get laid.

471
00:33:14.901 --> 00:33:19.105
He wrote in great comic detail
about his unfortunate tendency...


472
00:33:19.138 --> 00:33:23.676
to get an erection on all
forms of public transportation.


473
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:26.679
The school almost suspended him.

474
00:33:26.713 --> 00:33:28.881
You're crazy about him,
aren't you?


475
00:33:28.915 --> 00:33:32.585
He's a very weird kid, Doris.

476
00:33:32.619 --> 00:33:36.589
You know what?
I think that one really gets to you.


477
00:33:36.623 --> 00:33:39.458
Come on, now.
Admit it.


478
00:33:42.061 --> 00:33:44.997
All right, I admit it.
He's a nice kid.


479
00:33:45.031 --> 00:33:47.934
There.
Was that so hard?


480
00:33:53.005 --> 00:33:55.975
Mmm.
What was that for?


481
00:33:58.611 --> 00:34:01.247
For everything.

482
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.584
For this.

483
00:34:04.617 --> 00:34:07.620
For one beautiful weekend
every year with no cares,


484
00:34:07.654 --> 00:34:09.956
no ties,

485
00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:11.958
no responsibilities.

486
00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:19.666
Thank you, Doris.

487
00:34:38.084 --> 00:34:40.019
Doris.

488
00:34:45.758 --> 00:34:49.596
Gee, and I just got
all dressed up.


489
00:35:06.212 --> 00:35:08.214
Mmm.

490
00:35:11.183 --> 00:35:15.755
Oh, somebody has
a rotten sense of timing.


491
00:35:18.257 --> 00:35:20.159
Damn.

492
00:35:25.798 --> 00:35:27.700
Hello?

493
00:35:27.734 --> 00:35:30.803
Yes, this is Daddy!

494
00:35:30.837 --> 00:35:33.272
Is there anything wrong?

495
00:35:33.305 --> 00:35:35.274
Funny?

496
00:35:35.307 --> 00:35:39.378
That's probably because
Daddy was just, uh, uh...


497
00:35:39.411 --> 00:35:43.349
I have a frog
in my throat, sweetheart.


498
00:35:43.382 --> 00:35:45.818
Uh... wh...

499
00:35:45.852 --> 00:35:47.954
Oh, it came out, huh?

500
00:35:49.321 --> 00:35:54.160
Ohh. Well, of course
the tooth fairy will come.


501
00:35:55.361 --> 00:35:58.097
Well, tonight, of course.

502
00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:01.233
Well, sweetheart,
I wish Daddy could find it for you,


503
00:36:01.267 --> 00:36:04.771
but I'm, uh...
I'm working.


504
00:36:06.706 --> 00:36:09.676
Honey, does Mommy
know you called?


505
00:36:10.977 --> 00:36:14.280
Oh, I'll try.
Yes, I love you too, sweetheart.


506
00:36:14.313 --> 00:36:16.683
Yes, I do!

507
00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:18.718
Very much! Ye...

508
00:36:18.751 --> 00:36:21.120
Okay.

509
00:36:23.823 --> 00:36:26.125
Okay, bye.

510
00:36:26.158 --> 00:36:29.662
Oh, God, I feel so guilty!

511
00:36:29.696 --> 00:36:31.898
Was that Debbie?

512
00:36:31.931 --> 00:36:34.266
Her tooth came out,
and she can't find it,


513
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:36.836
and she's afraid the
tooth fairy won't know.


514
00:36:36.869 --> 00:36:40.873
Oh, God, that thin, reedy little voice!
You know what that does to me?


515
00:36:40.907 --> 00:36:44.811
Sure, that cheerful look on your
face doesn't fool me for a minute.


516
00:36:44.844 --> 00:36:47.113
You think this is funny?

517
00:36:47.146 --> 00:36:49.982
Doris, my little girl, said,
"I love you, Daddy,"


518
00:36:50.016 --> 00:36:53.352
and I answered her in a voice
still hoarse with passion.


519
00:36:53.385 --> 00:36:56.756
I get the picture, George.

520
00:36:56.789 --> 00:36:59.325
Don't you ever feel guilty?

521
00:36:59.358 --> 00:37:01.961
Sometimes.
Well, you never say anything.


522
00:37:01.994 --> 00:37:05.932
Well, I just handle it
in a different way. How?


523
00:37:05.965 --> 00:37:07.934
Privately.

524
00:37:07.967 --> 00:37:11.203
Boy, something like this
really brings you up short.


525
00:37:11.237 --> 00:37:15.074
I mean, look at this.
Look at me. Look.


526
00:37:15.107 --> 00:37:19.111
I tell you, Doris, when she started
talking about the tooth fairy,


527
00:37:19.145 --> 00:37:22.281
that affected me
in a very profound manner.


528
00:37:22.314 --> 00:37:26.719
On top of which,
I have indigestion you won't believe.


529
00:37:26.753 --> 00:37:28.955
It hit me that hard, you know?

530
00:37:28.988 --> 00:37:32.491
I have three children too,
you know, George?


531
00:37:32.524 --> 00:37:34.493
What do you want me to do?

532
00:37:34.526 --> 00:37:37.930
It would be terrific if you
stopped talking about it.


533
00:37:37.964 --> 00:37:41.400
It is only making you feel worse.
I can't feel worse!


534
00:37:41.433 --> 00:37:44.003
That pure little voice...
No, you're right. Oh!


535
00:37:44.036 --> 00:37:47.073
No, forget it.
Change the subject.


536
00:37:47.106 --> 00:37:50.476
So t-tell me about the
good story about Harry.


537
00:37:50.509 --> 00:37:52.411
He went bankrupt.

538
00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:57.950
How can you go bankrupt
selling TV sets?


539
00:37:57.984 --> 00:38:01.220
Harry has one little failing
as a salesman.


540
00:38:01.253 --> 00:38:06.125
It's a compulsion to talk people out of
things that they can't really afford.


541
00:38:06.158 --> 00:38:08.427
He kind of lacks
the killer instinct.


542
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:13.365
Actually, it's one of the things
about him that I like best.


543
00:38:13.399 --> 00:38:15.802
Oh, listen. Something
just occurred to me.


544
00:38:15.835 --> 00:38:19.338
Instead of my leaving at my usual time,
would you mind if I left a little earlier?


545
00:38:19.371 --> 00:38:23.175
When did you have in mind?
There's a plane in half an hour.


546
00:38:25.544 --> 00:38:29.548
You want to leave

547
00:38:29.581 --> 00:38:32.819
There's a connecting flight from
San Francisco in 90 minutes.


548
00:38:32.852 --> 00:38:34.821
I know how you feel.
Really, I do.


549
00:38:34.854 --> 00:38:38.524
I wouldn't suggest it if you weren't
a mother and didn't understand.


550
00:38:38.557 --> 00:38:41.460
It wouldn't even occur to me
if-if this crisis hadn't come up.


551
00:38:41.493 --> 00:38:44.964
I don't mean
just the tooth fairy.


552
00:38:44.997 --> 00:38:47.934
She could have swallowed
the tooth.


553
00:38:47.967 --> 00:38:52.004
It could be lodged
God knows where.


554
00:38:52.038 --> 00:38:56.042
Uh... have you seen
my hairbrush?


555
00:38:56.075 --> 00:38:58.377
Doris, I'm probably
doing you a big favor.


556
00:38:58.410 --> 00:39:02.514
If I did stay, I probably wouldn't be very
good company. I'm thinking of you too.


557
00:39:02.548 --> 00:39:06.085
With the way I'm feeling...
You probably understand.


558
00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.469
You feel somewhat
rejected, right?


559
00:39:25.872 --> 00:39:29.008
I understand.
Really, I do.


560
00:39:29.041 --> 00:39:34.046
I just want you to know that my leaving
has nothing to do with you and me.


561
00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.950
This is an emergency!
I have a sick child at home!


562
00:39:37.984 --> 00:39:40.186
Will you stop!

563
00:39:40.219 --> 00:39:45.091
This has nothing to do with
the goddamn tooth fairy!


564
00:39:45.124 --> 00:39:47.093
You are simply feeling guilty,

565
00:39:47.126 --> 00:39:51.130
and you wanna get
as far from me as possible.


566
00:39:51.163 --> 00:39:54.066
All right!
I feel guilty, yes!


567
00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:56.068
Is that so strange?

568
00:39:56.102 --> 00:39:57.970
Doris, we're cheating.

569
00:39:58.004 --> 00:40:00.572
Once a year
we lie to our families...


570
00:40:00.606 --> 00:40:03.142
and sneak off to a hotel
in California...


571
00:40:03.175 --> 00:40:05.577
and commit adultery!

572
00:40:05.611 --> 00:40:09.015
Not that I want to
stop doing it.


573
00:40:09.048 --> 00:40:13.052
But yes, I feel guilty.
I admit it.


574
00:40:13.085 --> 00:40:15.054
You admit it?

575
00:40:15.087 --> 00:40:17.356
You take out ads.

576
00:40:17.389 --> 00:40:20.426
I'll bet you stop strangers
on the street!


577
00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:24.396
Y-You probably have
a scarlet "A" embroidered...


578
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:26.465
on your jockey shorts.

579
00:40:26.498 --> 00:40:29.101
You go around
like an open nerve saying,


580
00:40:29.135 --> 00:40:32.104
"Yes, I'm cheating,
but look how guilty I feel,


581
00:40:32.138 --> 00:40:35.107
so I must really be
a nice guy."


582
00:40:35.141 --> 00:40:39.946
Then... Then to top it all,
you have the incredible arrogance...


583
00:40:39.979 --> 00:40:43.149
of thinking you're the only person
in the world with a conscience.


584
00:40:43.182 --> 00:40:45.584
Well, that doesn't make you
a nice guy, George!


585
00:40:45.617 --> 00:40:49.455
You know what that makes you?
A horse's ass!


586
00:41:00.199 --> 00:41:04.971
I liked you a lot better before you
joined the Book of the Month Club.


587
00:41:05.004 --> 00:41:07.039
Yes, I'll just bet you did.

588
00:41:07.073 --> 00:41:11.110
- Look, can we discuss this in the car?
- The car?


589
00:41:11.143 --> 00:41:14.380
I really hate to ask you, Doris,
but I need a lift to the airport.


590
00:41:42.208 --> 00:41:46.378
Cheer up, Doris. It's not the end of the
world. I'm not leaving you permanently.


591
00:41:46.412 --> 00:41:49.081
I'll see you next year.

592
00:41:49.115 --> 00:41:51.083
No, I don't think you will.

593
00:41:51.117 --> 00:41:54.053
Just because I have to
leave early one year,


594
00:41:54.086 --> 00:41:57.089
you're willing to throw away
a lifetime of weekends?


595
00:41:57.123 --> 00:41:59.091
How can you be so casual?

596
00:41:59.125 --> 00:42:02.628
I don't see any point in going on.
Don't do that to me.


597
00:42:02.661 --> 00:42:05.297
Don't try to manipulate me.
I get enough of that at home.


598
00:42:05.331 --> 00:42:10.102
What's the sense of meeting in guilt and
remorse, huh? What joy is there in that?


599
00:42:10.136 --> 00:42:15.207
Look, I have a commitment there.
And you have none here?


600
00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:18.544
Here? I thought our only commitment
here was to show up every year.


601
00:42:18.577 --> 00:42:20.546
Nice and tidy, huh?

602
00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:25.451
Just two friendly sex partners that
meet every year and touch and let go.


603
00:42:25.484 --> 00:42:28.454
Is that it?
So maybe I was kidding myself.


604
00:42:28.487 --> 00:42:31.390
- I'm human.
- So am I.


605
00:42:31.423 --> 00:42:35.061
But you're different.
You're stronger.


606
00:42:35.094 --> 00:42:37.196
Y-You seem able
to take care of yourself.


607
00:42:37.229 --> 00:42:39.498
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you something.


608
00:42:39.531 --> 00:42:43.735
In the past year, I've picked up
the phone to call you 10 times.


609
00:42:43.769 --> 00:42:46.138
I couldn't stop
thinking about you.


610
00:42:46.172 --> 00:42:50.576
You kept slipping over into my real
life, and it scared the hell out of me.


611
00:42:50.609 --> 00:42:53.679
More to the point,
I felt guilty.


612
00:42:53.712 --> 00:42:56.748
So I decided that we shouldn't
see each other anymore.


613
00:42:56.782 --> 00:43:00.519
I wasn't even going to come, but I thought
at least I owed you an explanation,


614
00:43:00.552 --> 00:43:02.821
so I came.

615
00:43:02.854 --> 00:43:06.292
When you walked through the door,
I knew I couldn't go through with it,


616
00:43:06.325 --> 00:43:08.660
that no matter what the price,

617
00:43:08.694 --> 00:43:10.629
I was willing to pay it.

618
00:43:10.662 --> 00:43:14.600
You better get on your plane.

619
00:44:08.254 --> 00:44:11.390
I love you, Doris.
I'm an idiot.


620
00:44:11.423 --> 00:44:14.226
I suspect I'm deeply
neurotic and I'm no bargain,


621
00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.395
but I do love you.

622
00:44:16.428 --> 00:44:18.864
Will you let me stay?

623
00:44:21.733 --> 00:44:26.872

634
00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:18.857
No, of course I
haven't left Helen.


635
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:21.360
I'm on a business trip.

636
00:45:21.393 --> 00:45:23.629
I come up here every year.

637
00:45:25.897 --> 00:45:29.501
I am not running away
from the problem.


638
00:45:29.535 --> 00:45:31.970
Of course I know it's serious.

639
00:45:32.003 --> 00:45:35.907
I still don't think that's any reason
to call me long distance and try...


640
00:45:37.709 --> 00:45:40.679
Yes, I saw a doctor.

641
00:45:40.712 --> 00:45:43.415
He said... He said
it's no big deal.


642
00:45:43.449 --> 00:45:48.987
He said every man has this problem
at one time or another and...


643
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:52.791
Look, if we have to discuss this, you might
as well learn to pronounce it correctly.


644
00:45:52.824 --> 00:45:56.528
It's impotence, not im-po-tence.

645
00:46:00.999 --> 00:46:06.238
It is not something
you have to nip in the bud!


646
00:46:06.272 --> 00:46:08.907
Yes, of... of course I'm gonna
try to do something about it.


647
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:13.011
Would you let me handle this in my own way?
Would you pl... May I...


648
00:46:13.044 --> 00:46:15.747
I... I'm gonna be fine,
all right?


649
00:46:15.781 --> 00:46:19.585
I'm gonna... I'm gonna be okay.
I can feel it. I know it.


650
00:46:21.687 --> 00:46:23.922
I'm seeing someone out here
who's an expert.


651
00:46:34.065 --> 00:46:37.269
I'm gonna hang up now!

652
00:46:37.303 --> 00:46:39.004
Good-bye, Mother!

653
00:46:43.642 --> 00:46:46.244
Hello, Mr. Chalmers.
Afternoon, ma'am.


654
00:46:58.924 --> 00:47:00.992
George?

655
00:47:01.026 --> 00:47:02.961
Be right out, darling.

656
00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:45.404
How are you, lover?

657
00:47:54.112 --> 00:47:55.914
Guess what.

658
00:47:58.484 --> 00:48:00.619
Oh, my God!

659
00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:07.593
What did you do to yourself?

660
00:48:07.626 --> 00:48:09.795
Well, I can't take
all the credit.


661
00:48:09.828 --> 00:48:12.864
It was sort of a mutual effort.

662
00:48:15.601 --> 00:48:18.670
George, when you haven't seen
an old friend in a whole year,


663
00:48:18.704 --> 00:48:22.474
isn't it customary to give
'em a kiss hello? What?


664
00:48:22.508 --> 00:48:24.443
A kiss?

665
00:48:25.711 --> 00:48:28.714
Kiss?

666
00:48:28.747 --> 00:48:31.383
Oh, yeah. Oh, sorry.

667
00:48:31.417 --> 00:48:33.785
Oh. Ohh.

668
00:48:35.854 --> 00:48:37.789
You okay, pal?
Oh, I'm fine.


669
00:48:37.823 --> 00:48:41.860
I'm fine. I'm just a little surprised.
You're surprised.


670
00:48:41.893 --> 00:48:45.096
I insisted upon visiting
the dead rabbit's grave.


671
00:48:49.535 --> 00:48:53.839
George, how come you're wearing your
robe and pajamas in the afternoon?


672
00:48:56.942 --> 00:49:00.111
I'm rehearsing
a Noel Coward play.


673
00:49:03.782 --> 00:49:06.985
Is there something on your mind?

674
00:49:07.018 --> 00:49:09.921
Uh, no, not anymore.
No.


675
00:49:13.492 --> 00:49:15.827
You must be
eight months pregnant.


676
00:49:15.861 --> 00:49:18.029
Exactly.

677
00:49:18.063 --> 00:49:20.799
Oh, come on!
It's not all that tragic.


678
00:49:20.832 --> 00:49:25.403
We can find some other way to communicate.
Great. Great.


679
00:49:26.872 --> 00:49:28.907
You got any ideas?

680
00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:31.843
Is there something else
bothering you?


681
00:49:31.877 --> 00:49:35.080
No. Mm-mmm. No.

682
00:49:37.148 --> 00:49:40.886
Well, you know, every year it
is always a little awkward...


683
00:49:40.919 --> 00:49:42.888
when we first meet.

684
00:49:42.921 --> 00:49:47.893
We manage to take care of that with a lot
of heavy breathing between the sheets.


685
00:49:47.926 --> 00:49:49.961
Uh, Doris, uh...

686
00:49:49.995 --> 00:49:53.031
If we're not gonna do it,
do you mind if we don't talk about it?


687
00:49:53.064 --> 00:49:56.535
No, I just meant maybe we need
something else to help break the ice.


688
00:49:56.568 --> 00:49:59.905
Well, I'm wide open to suggestions.
Okay.


689
00:49:59.938 --> 00:50:01.973
How 'bout this?

690
00:50:02.007 --> 00:50:05.944
How about if, uh, if I tell you some
deep, dark secret about myself...


691
00:50:05.977 --> 00:50:08.013
that I've never
told anyone before,


692
00:50:08.046 --> 00:50:11.917
and then you tell me
some secret about yourself.


693
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:14.920
- I've had enough surprises.
- You're gonna like this one.


694
00:50:14.953 --> 00:50:17.689
I've been having
sex dreams about you.


695
00:50:17.723 --> 00:50:21.059
Oh, yeah?
Almost every night too.


696
00:50:21.092 --> 00:50:24.863
What kind of sex dreams?
That's what's so strange.


697
00:50:24.896 --> 00:50:26.965
They're always the same.

698
00:50:26.998 --> 00:50:31.169
I mean, we're making love,
but it's always underwater.


699
00:50:32.237 --> 00:50:34.973
It's in caves, grottos,
swimming pools,


700
00:50:35.006 --> 00:50:37.108
but always underwater.

701
00:50:37.142 --> 00:50:39.110
Isn't that weird?

702
00:50:39.144 --> 00:50:42.180
I think it probably has something
to do with my being pregnant.


703
00:50:42.213 --> 00:50:44.716
Always underwater, huh?
Come on.


704
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:47.519
You tell me some deep,
dark secret about yourself.


705
00:50:47.553 --> 00:50:49.487
I can't swim.

706
00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:54.560
I'll start with
the good story about her.


707
00:50:54.593 --> 00:50:57.095
You've never done that before.
You must be mellowing.


708
00:50:57.128 --> 00:51:00.866
Doris, do you mind?
No, I don't mind.


709
00:51:00.899 --> 00:51:03.001
We went to London,

710
00:51:03.034 --> 00:51:05.203
and as we were checking
into the hotel,


711
00:51:05.236 --> 00:51:08.173
there was a man in a formal
coat and striped pants...


712
00:51:08.206 --> 00:51:12.110
standing at the front
entrance of the hotel.


713
00:51:12.143 --> 00:51:15.647
Helen handed him her suitcase
and breezed into the lobby.


714
00:51:15.681 --> 00:51:17.833
The man followed her in
and politely explained


715
00:51:17.858 --> 00:51:19.985
that not only didn't
he work at the hotel,


716
00:51:20.018 --> 00:51:24.055
but that he was the Danish ambassador.

717
00:51:24.089 --> 00:51:27.125
And without batting an
eye, Helen said,


718
00:51:27.158 --> 00:51:32.564
"Well, that's marvelous! You can tell us
the good places to eat in Copenhagen."


719
00:51:32.598 --> 00:51:34.299
And he did!

720
00:51:35.934 --> 00:51:38.837
The point is,
it doesn't bother her at all...


721
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:42.273
if she makes
a total ass of herself.


722
00:51:42.307 --> 00:51:44.976
I really admire that.

723
00:51:48.146 --> 00:51:51.850
And what is it
that you don't admire?


724
00:51:51.883 --> 00:51:55.086
It's that damn
sense of humor of hers.


725
00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.690
Good. These are always
the stories I like best.


726
00:52:03.128 --> 00:52:05.631
We'd been to a party,

727
00:52:05.664 --> 00:52:08.667
and we'd had a few drinks.

728
00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:12.738
So we went to bed
and we started making love,


729
00:52:12.771 --> 00:52:15.373
and nothing happened.

730
00:52:15.406 --> 00:52:18.009
I mean, for me.

731
00:52:18.043 --> 00:52:20.011
I mean, I couldn't...

732
00:52:20.045 --> 00:52:23.048
Well, you get the picture.
Yeah. It was no big deal.


733
00:52:23.081 --> 00:52:25.751
I mean, we laughed about it.

734
00:52:25.784 --> 00:52:30.021
Then about a half hour later,
just as I was going to sleep,


735
00:52:30.055 --> 00:52:32.724
Helen turned to me
and said, "It's funny.


736
00:52:32.758 --> 00:52:37.663
When I married a C.P.A., I always thought
it would be his eyes that would go first."


737
00:52:48.807 --> 00:52:53.111
Well... she was just trying
to make you feel better.


738
00:52:53.144 --> 00:52:56.047
Well, it didn't.
Some things aren't funny.


739
00:52:59.184 --> 00:53:03.221
What I'm trying to say is the thing
that bugs me the most about Helen...


740
00:53:03.254 --> 00:53:05.123
is that she broke my pecker.

741
00:53:11.129 --> 00:53:14.065
- You're impotent.
- Slightly.


742
00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:17.202
That's five people who know.

743
00:53:17.235 --> 00:53:21.439
You, me, Helen and her mother.
Who's the fifth?


744
00:53:21.472 --> 00:53:26.978
Chet Huntley. I'm sure her mother has
given him the bulletin for the 6:00 news.


745
00:53:27.012 --> 00:53:30.115
Honey, when did this happen?
Happen?


746
00:53:30.148 --> 00:53:33.852
Doris, we're not talking
about a throughway accident.


747
00:53:33.885 --> 00:53:35.920
You don't wake up one morning and say,

748
00:53:35.945 --> 00:53:38.814
"Shoot, the family jewels
have gone on the blink."


749
00:53:40.158 --> 00:53:42.694
It's a gradual thing.

750
00:53:42.728 --> 00:53:45.396
And how's Helen reacting to it?

751
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:47.465
We haven't discussed it much.

752
00:53:47.498 --> 00:53:51.870
I got the impression she regards it as
a lapse in one's social responsibility.


753
00:53:51.903 --> 00:53:56.007
Rather like letting your partner down
in tennis by not holding your serve.


754
00:53:57.508 --> 00:54:00.311
I'll be all right.

755
00:54:00.345 --> 00:54:04.415
The patient's not dead,
just resting.


756
00:54:04.449 --> 00:54:08.119
Doris, that statement hardly
calls for congratulations.


757
00:54:08.153 --> 00:54:10.789
No, I need help getting up.

758
00:54:27.505 --> 00:54:31.142
Is there anything I can say that
would make you feel any better?


759
00:54:31.176 --> 00:54:34.345
You can say anything you want
except, "It's all in your head."


760
00:54:34.379 --> 00:54:38.183
I'm no doctor, but I have
a great sense of direction.


761
00:54:39.785 --> 00:54:41.853
What shall we talk about?

762
00:54:41.887 --> 00:54:44.189
Anything but sex.

763
00:54:44.222 --> 00:54:46.524
How do you feel being pregnant?

764
00:54:46.557 --> 00:54:49.260
Oh, catatonic,

765
00:54:49.294 --> 00:54:51.863
incredulous,

766
00:54:51.897 --> 00:54:54.365
angry,

767
00:54:54.399 --> 00:54:57.869
pragmatic and...

768
00:54:57.903 --> 00:55:00.038
finally maternal.

769
00:55:00.071 --> 00:55:03.174
Pretty much in that order.
Your vocabulary is improving.


770
00:55:03.208 --> 00:55:05.176
Oh, you don't know.

771
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:07.545
You happen to be speaking
to a high school graduate.


772
00:55:07.578 --> 00:55:09.781
No kidding. How come?

773
00:55:09.815 --> 00:55:13.985
I was confined to my bed for the
first three months of my pregnancy,


774
00:55:14.019 --> 00:55:17.288
so it shouldn't be a total loss,
I took a correspondence course.


775
00:55:17.322 --> 00:55:19.490
You're really something,
you know that?


776
00:55:19.524 --> 00:55:22.802
There's kind of an
ironic twist to all this.


777
00:55:22.827 --> 00:55:23.895
What?

778
00:55:23.929 --> 00:55:27.899
I didn't graduate from high school
the first time because I got pregnant.


779
00:55:27.933 --> 00:55:32.337
Now I did graduate from high
school because I got pregnant.


780
00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:36.307
I don't know. That kind of
appeals to my sense of order.


781
00:55:36.341 --> 00:55:38.476
Harry still selling real estate?

782
00:55:38.509 --> 00:55:40.846
No. Insurance.

783
00:55:40.879 --> 00:55:42.814
He likes it, though.

784
00:55:42.848 --> 00:55:46.551
Gives him a chance to look up
all his old army buddies.


785
00:55:48.153 --> 00:55:50.588
Are you comfortable
in that position?


786
00:55:50.621 --> 00:55:54.192
When you're in my condition,
you're not comfortable in any position.


787
00:55:54.225 --> 00:55:56.261
Come on.
Sit over here.


788
00:56:07.405 --> 00:56:09.875
Oh, that's good.

789
00:56:11.276 --> 00:56:13.278
Now, tell me, how are the kids?

790
00:56:13.311 --> 00:56:17.115
They're fine. Michael just got
a job with the Associated Press.


791
00:56:17.148 --> 00:56:19.851
Really? Oh, that's terrific!
Isn't that great?


792
00:56:19.885 --> 00:56:22.587
Gee, I feel so proud of him.

793
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:35.200
What?

794
00:56:35.233 --> 00:56:38.469
George, why are you
looking at me like that?


795
00:56:40.305 --> 00:56:43.141
No reason.

796
00:56:43.174 --> 00:56:45.543
I ju... It's too...
I was won... uh...


797
00:56:45.576 --> 00:56:48.279
Fir-First I was try... Nothing!
Forget it. It's all right.


798
00:56:48.313 --> 00:56:52.117
Just, uh, tell me the... tell
me the other story about Harry.


799
00:56:52.150 --> 00:56:54.953
You know.

800
00:56:56.354 --> 00:57:00.591
George, what is it?
You're still doing it.


801
00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:03.394
It's obscene!
What is?


802
00:57:03.428 --> 00:57:08.199
When I touched you just now,
I started to get excited.


803
00:57:08.233 --> 00:57:10.668
What kind of a pervert am I?

804
00:57:10.701 --> 00:57:15.506
Staring at a 200-pound pregnant
woman, and I'm getting hot.


805
00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:18.209
Well, I'll tell you something.

806
00:57:18.243 --> 00:57:22.647
That is about the nicest thing
anybody's said to me in months.


807
00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:25.383
It's not funny, Doris.

808
00:57:25.416 --> 00:57:27.652
I really got to ya, huh, fella?

809
00:57:30.555 --> 00:57:33.558
Uh, would you excuse me?

810
00:57:55.246 --> 00:57:59.250
That's incredible!
Are you as good as I think you are?


811
00:57:59.284 --> 00:58:01.286
How good do you think I am?
Sensational.


812
00:58:01.319 --> 00:58:03.621
I'm not as good
as you think I am.


813
00:58:03.654 --> 00:58:07.625
But that piano's been sitting here for

814
00:58:07.658 --> 00:58:10.695
Why tonight?
It beats a cold shower.


815
00:58:10.728 --> 00:58:14.265
You mean, you play
to relieve sexual tension?


816
00:58:14.299 --> 00:58:19.337
You don't even get this good
without a lot of practice.


817
00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:23.341
You're gonna be exhausted.
That's the idea.


818
00:58:27.145 --> 00:58:29.714
I've got a better idea.
Come on.


819
00:58:29.747 --> 00:58:33.651
Doris... Come on. It's all right.
It'll be okay.


820
00:58:33.684 --> 00:58:36.054
But... But you can't...

821
00:58:36.087 --> 00:58:39.557
Well, I know that.
Well, then how...


822
00:58:39.590 --> 00:58:44.029
Well, we can work something
out, can't we?


823
00:58:46.764 --> 00:58:49.200
Oh.
What... What is it?


824
00:58:49.234 --> 00:58:52.737
Aah!
For God's sake, what is it?


825
00:58:52.770 --> 00:58:57.508
Doris, what the hell
is the matter?


826
00:58:57.542 --> 00:59:01.679
If memory serves me correctly,
I just had a labor pain.


827
00:59:01.712 --> 00:59:05.616
You can't have. It must be indigestion.
No. There's a difference.


828
00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:08.553
Indigestion doesn't
make your eyes bug out.


829
00:59:10.488 --> 00:59:13.258
You can't be in labor.
When... When's the baby due?


830
00:59:13.291 --> 00:59:16.427
Not for another month, but...

831
00:59:16.461 --> 00:59:20.331
Oh! Oh, my God!
What have I done?


832
00:59:20.365 --> 00:59:23.601
What have you done?
I brought this on with my selfishness.


833
00:59:23.634 --> 00:59:26.637
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
You had nothing to do with it.


834
00:59:26.671 --> 00:59:30.708
Doris, don't treat me like a child.
Will you stop getting excited?


835
00:59:30.741 --> 00:59:34.545
Excited? I thought I had
problems with my sex life before.


836
00:59:34.579 --> 00:59:39.150
Can you imagine what this is gonna
do to it? Just... Will you just...


837
00:59:39.184 --> 00:59:41.652
Ohh. Oh,
I think I'd better lie down.


838
00:59:41.686 --> 00:59:44.722
What kind of a man am I? What kind
of a man would do a thing like this?


839
00:59:44.755 --> 00:59:47.792
May I say something? Doris,
I appreciate what you're trying to do,


840
00:59:47.825 --> 00:59:50.428
but nothing you can say would
make me feel any better.


841
00:59:50.461 --> 00:59:54.765
I'm not trying to make you feel any better.
I'm gonna have a baby.


842
00:59:54.799 --> 00:59:59.070
I know that.
No. I mean now.


843
00:59:59.104 --> 01:00:02.773
I have a history of short labor.

844
01:00:02.807 --> 01:00:05.110
Oh, no! No, no, no!

845
01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:08.746
No, no, no, no!
Oh, no! No!


846
01:00:16.187 --> 01:00:19.124
How do you feel?

847
01:00:21.692 --> 01:00:24.595
Like I'm gonna have a baby.

848
01:00:24.629 --> 01:00:28.108
Maybe it's a false alarm.
It's a false alarm. That's all.


849
01:00:28.133 --> 01:00:29.267
No. No.

850
01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:33.104
No. Now, just get ahold of yourself,
honey, and get on the phone...


851
01:00:33.138 --> 01:00:36.741
and find out
where the nearest hospital is.


852
01:00:36.774 --> 01:00:40.077
Hospital?
You wanna go to a hospital?


853
01:00:41.712 --> 01:00:45.683
George, like it or not,

854
01:00:45.716 --> 01:00:49.587
I am going to have a baby!

855
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:53.324
But we're not married.
That's going to look odd.


856
01:00:55.393 --> 01:00:59.530
Will you get
on the phone, please,


857
01:00:59.564 --> 01:01:03.701
and find out
where the hospital is!


858
01:01:06.837 --> 01:01:09.740
- Well, where are you going?
- To the bathroom!


859
01:01:09.774 --> 01:01:11.709
Why?

860
01:01:12.743 --> 01:01:15.880
It's hard to explain.

861
01:01:15.913 --> 01:01:19.384
Hello. Mr. Chalmers,
this is George.


862
01:01:19.417 --> 01:01:22.487
Uh, where's
the nearest hospital?


863
01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:27.858
Uh, well, it's... it's my wife.
Something unexpected came up.


864
01:01:27.892 --> 01:01:31.796
She got pregnant,
and now she's gonna have the baby.


865
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:34.365
That far?

866
01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:37.302
All right. Look.
Get him on the phone right away, will ya?


867
01:01:37.335 --> 01:01:40.371
Doris, are you all right?

868
01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:43.874
Doris? Doris,
answer me!


869
01:01:43.908 --> 01:01:47.945
I'm busy!
Oh, Jesus!


870
01:01:47.978 --> 01:01:52.917
Hello? Yes, yes!
Uh, hello. Uh... hello.


871
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:58.889
Um, I'm here at the Sea Shadows
Inn just outside of Mendocino.


872
01:01:58.923 --> 01:02:04.795
I was in my room before, and I heard
this groaning from the next room.


873
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:09.800
And, um, well,
I knock on the door,


874
01:02:09.834 --> 01:02:14.805
and I found this lady... who I've
never seen before in my life...


875
01:02:14.839 --> 01:02:17.808
Uh, in labor.

876
01:02:20.811 --> 01:02:23.714
Do you have to know that?

877
01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:30.588
George Peters.
So... George Peters. Peters.


878
01:02:32.523 --> 01:02:35.793
I don't know. I didn't time them.
Three or four minutes apart, I guess.


879
01:02:35.826 --> 01:02:37.862
I don't know.

880
01:02:37.895 --> 01:02:40.698
All right.
Uh... Uh, hold on.


881
01:02:40.731 --> 01:02:43.534
Doris? Doris,
who's your doctor?


882
01:02:43.568 --> 01:02:45.870
Joseph Harrington.
Uh, Joseph Harrington.


883
01:02:45.903 --> 01:02:48.439
In Oakland.
In, uh... in Oakland.


884
01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:53.778
534-0711.

885
01:02:53.811 --> 01:02:59.450
Um... Yes, uh, I-I have a car.
I'd be glad to take her over there.


886
01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:03.754
Sure. Uh, could you... could
you just answer one question?


887
01:03:03.788 --> 01:03:08.359
Would... Would erotic contact in
the last stages of pregnancy...


888
01:03:08.393 --> 01:03:11.896
bring on premature...

889
01:03:11.929 --> 01:03:15.466
No reason. Just interested.
Just, you know...


890
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.504
Okay. I'll get her right
over there. Okay. Bye.


891
01:03:19.537 --> 01:03:20.855
All right. It's okay.

892
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.809
They're gonna call your doctor,
and he's gonna meet us at the hospital.


893
01:03:24.842 --> 01:03:29.947
We're not gonna make it to the hospital.
My water just broke.


894
01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:34.919
Oh, my God! We're gonna have
to find a doctor in the area.


895
01:03:34.952 --> 01:03:38.989
Oh, my... Ohh, my God.
You look awful!


896
01:03:39.023 --> 01:03:42.693
What if we can't find one?
You're not gonna faint, are you?


897
01:03:42.727 --> 01:03:46.964
Doris, I'm not a cabdriver!
I don't know how to deliver babies!


898
01:03:46.997 --> 01:03:51.936
George, this is no time to start
acting like Butterfly McQueen.


899
01:03:51.969 --> 01:03:55.005
Now, you just get on the phone
and find a doctor.


900
01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.316
Ohh.

901
01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:09.920
Hello. Uh, Mr. Chalmers,
where's the nearest doctor?


902
01:04:09.954 --> 01:04:13.491
Well, get... Look.
Get him on the phone for me, will you?


903
01:04:13.524 --> 01:04:15.059
This is an emergency.

904
01:04:15.092 --> 01:04:16.561
It's all right.
It's okay.


905
01:04:16.594 --> 01:04:17.562
No! No!

906
01:04:17.595 --> 01:04:19.997
Hold on. Hold on.
It's okay, baby.


907
01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:22.742
This will teach you to fool
around with a married woman!


908
01:04:22.767 --> 01:04:24.502
Shh! What's the matter with you?

909
01:04:24.535 --> 01:04:27.472
Get that down! Get down!
Get down! Put that down!


910
01:04:27.505 --> 01:04:32.009
Calm down. Relax.
Just keep that down. Hel...


911
01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:34.912
What do you mean,
his answering service?


912
01:04:34.945 --> 01:04:38.416
W... No, no. Wait. Wait a second.
You don't understand.


913
01:04:38.449 --> 01:04:41.952
This is an emergency.
She's in the last stages of labor!


914
01:04:44.021 --> 01:04:49.794
Well, get in your car and drive down
to the goddamn pier and get him!


915
01:04:49.827 --> 01:04:53.364
Just get him!
It's okay. It's all right.


916
01:04:53.398 --> 01:04:56.000
Relax.

917
01:04:56.033 --> 01:05:00.137
He's... The doctor's on his boat,
but he's just down... down the road,


918
01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:05.075
and, uh... and, uh... Chalmers is
gonna drive down there in his...


919
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:07.478
God... in his car and get him.

920
01:05:07.512 --> 01:05:10.047
He'll be right here.

921
01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.982
What?

922
01:05:12.016 --> 01:05:15.019
What? What? What? What?

923
01:05:15.052 --> 01:05:18.789
I feel the baby!
No!


924
01:05:21.826 --> 01:05:24.562
George, I'm scared.

925
01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:30.000
Honey, do something.

926
01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:35.606
- I'll be right back.
- George, don't leave me.


927
01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.743
- I'm right here, baby. I'm right here.
- George!


928
01:05:38.776 --> 01:05:42.747
What are those for?
We're gonna have a baby.


929
01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.616
- "We"?
- Yeah, but I'm gonna need your help.


930
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:51.155
Give me your hand.
Look into my eyes.


931
01:05:51.188 --> 01:05:54.959
You're gonna be fine.

932
01:05:54.992 --> 01:05:59.630
There's nothing to worry about.
We're together. Okay.


933
01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:02.933
You think I play the piano well?
Yeah.


934
01:06:02.967 --> 01:06:06.537
Wait till you see
the way I deliver babies.


935
01:07:24.014 --> 01:07:26.884
Hey, man.
What do ya say?


936
01:07:41.799 --> 01:07:45.570
Mmm. So... wanna fuck?

937
01:07:49.039 --> 01:07:54.144
What? You didn't
understand the question?


938
01:07:54.178 --> 01:07:59.083
Of course I did. I just think it's a
damned odd way to start a conversation.


939
01:07:59.116 --> 01:08:03.120
Oh. Gee, I thought it was
a great little icebreaker.


940
01:08:04.221 --> 01:08:08.726
Aren't you horny
after your long flight?


941
01:08:08.759 --> 01:08:12.296
I didn't fly. I drove.
From Connecticut?


942
01:08:12.329 --> 01:08:15.933
No. From Los Angeles. We moved to
Beverly Hills about six months ago.


943
01:08:15.966 --> 01:08:18.202
Ohh. How come?

944
01:08:18.235 --> 01:08:21.739
A number of reasons. I got tired of
standing knee-deep in the snow...


945
01:08:21.772 --> 01:08:26.243
trying to scrape the ice off my
windshield with a credit card.


946
01:08:26.276 --> 01:08:30.214
There are people here with a lot of
money who don't know what to do with it.


947
01:08:30.247 --> 01:08:34.218
And you tell 'em?
I'm what they call a business manager.


948
01:08:34.251 --> 01:08:39.256
- How's it goin'?
- Can't complain. Why?


949
01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:42.359
You look kind of shitty.

950
01:08:42.392 --> 01:08:46.296
Is everything all right?

951
01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:48.663
When did you start dressing like an Indian?

952
01:08:48.688 --> 01:08:51.368
You look like a refugee
from the Sunset Strip.


953
01:08:51.401 --> 01:08:55.005
Oh, no. I've gone
back to school... Berkeley.


954
01:08:55.039 --> 01:08:58.208
Why?
Why?


955
01:08:58.242 --> 01:09:00.878
You mean, what do I want
to be when I grow up?


956
01:09:00.911 --> 01:09:04.181
Well, you have to admit it's a bit
odd becoming a schoolgirl at your age.


957
01:09:04.214 --> 01:09:09.053
Hey, listen. You think it's easy being the
only one in your class with clear skin?


958
01:09:09.086 --> 01:09:14.024
What made you do it? Actually,
it was a dinner party that made me decide.


959
01:09:14.058 --> 01:09:18.328
Harry's boss invited us over for
dinner, and I just freaked. Why?


960
01:09:18.362 --> 01:09:22.633
Well, I'd spent so much time at home with
the kids that I really wasn't sure...


961
01:09:22.667 --> 01:09:25.429
I was capable of carrying on
an intelligent conversation


962
01:09:25.454 --> 01:09:27.271
with anyone over the age of five.

963
01:09:27.304 --> 01:09:31.942
So, anyway, we went,
and I got seated right next to the boss.


964
01:09:31.976 --> 01:09:35.312
But, you know, I surprised myself.
I mean, he talked and I talked.


965
01:09:35.345 --> 01:09:38.082
It was just like
a regular conversation.


966
01:09:38.115 --> 01:09:40.150
I thought everything was cool,

967
01:09:40.184 --> 01:09:43.253
till I noticed that he was looking
at me in kind of a weird way.


968
01:09:43.287 --> 01:09:47.224
I looked down at his plate and discovered
that all the time we had been talking,


969
01:09:47.257 --> 01:09:51.328
I'd been cutting up
his meat for him.


970
01:09:54.431 --> 01:09:58.035
That's when I decided that I'd
better get out of the house.


971
01:09:58.068 --> 01:10:00.137
Yeah, but why school?
Oh, I don't know.


972
01:10:00.170 --> 01:10:05.776
I felt restless and undirected, and I
thought school would give me some answers.


973
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:10.881
What sort of answers?
You know, like where it's really at.


974
01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:14.318
Jesus.
What?


975
01:10:14.351 --> 01:10:16.821
That expression.

976
01:10:16.854 --> 01:10:19.857
Okay. I wanted to find
out who the hell I am.


977
01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:22.727
You don't get answers
like that from the classroom.


978
01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.062
Well, I'm not in
a classroom all the time.


979
01:10:25.095 --> 01:10:27.865
I'll tell ya, the protests
and demonstrations...


980
01:10:27.898 --> 01:10:31.902
are a learning experience
in themselves.


981
01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:35.906
Protests against what?

982
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:40.244
The war. Didn't you hear about it?
It was in all the papers.


983
01:10:40.277 --> 01:10:44.281
Demonstrations
aren't gonna stop the war.


984
01:10:44.314 --> 01:10:49.119
Oh, really?
Have you got a better idea?


985
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:56.093
Look, I didn't drive all the
way up here to discuss politics.


986
01:10:59.363 --> 01:11:04.334
Well, so far you've turned
down sex and politics.


987
01:11:04.368 --> 01:11:08.138
Would you like to try religion?

988
01:11:08.172 --> 01:11:11.208
I think I'll try a Librium.

989
01:11:33.163 --> 01:11:36.066
Jesus.

990
01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:41.238
Ohh. Honey,
why are you so uptight?


991
01:11:41.271 --> 01:11:44.408
That's another expression I hate.
"Uptight"?


992
01:11:44.441 --> 01:11:49.413
There's no such word.
You remind me of my mother.


993
01:11:49.446 --> 01:11:52.182
When I was nine,
I asked her what "fuck" meant.


994
01:11:52.216 --> 01:11:56.253
You know what she said?
"There's no such word."


995
01:11:56.286 --> 01:11:57.429
And now you know there is,

996
01:11:57.454 --> 01:12:00.048
you feel compelled to use
it in every other sentence?


997
01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:06.096
What is bugging you? "Bugging" me?
I'll tell you what's bugging me.


998
01:12:06.130 --> 01:12:08.365
The blacks
are burning down the cities.


999
01:12:08.398 --> 01:12:11.936
There's a Harvard professor telling
my kids the only way to happiness...


1000
01:12:11.969 --> 01:12:14.571
is to become doped-up zombies.

1001
01:12:14.604 --> 01:12:17.507
And I have a teenage son with
hair so long that from the back,


1002
01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:22.246
he looks exactly
like Yvonne De Carlo.


1003
01:12:22.279 --> 01:12:27.117
You know that's a sign of
age, don't you? What is?


1004
01:12:27.151 --> 01:12:31.121
When you start worrying about the
declining morality of the young.


1005
01:12:31.155 --> 01:12:34.291
Besides, there is nothing
you can do about it.


1006
01:12:34.324 --> 01:12:37.227
We can start
setting some examples.


1007
01:12:37.261 --> 01:12:41.398
As I recall, when you
were a little younger,


1008
01:12:41.431 --> 01:12:44.168
you were not exactly a monk
about that sort of thing.


1009
01:12:44.201 --> 01:12:47.171
That was different.

1010
01:12:47.204 --> 01:12:50.908
Our relationship is not based
on a casual one-night stand.


1011
01:12:50.941 --> 01:12:53.310
No. It's been

1012
01:12:55.345 --> 01:12:59.416
It's not the same.
We shared things.


1013
01:12:59.449 --> 01:13:02.386
My God. I helped deliver your child.
Remember?


1014
01:13:02.419 --> 01:13:05.589
Remember?

1015
01:13:05.622 --> 01:13:09.526
I consider that our finest hour.

1016
01:13:15.232 --> 01:13:19.036
- How is she?
- Georgette?


1017
01:13:19.069 --> 01:13:23.307
Ooh, she's very healthy,
very noisy and very spoiled.


1018
01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.176
Don't you feel guilty leaving
her alone when you go to school?


1019
01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:28.245
No. Harry's home a lot.

1020
01:13:28.278 --> 01:13:30.915
How does Harry feel
about all this? Oh.


1021
01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:33.884
When I told him I wanted to go back
to school to get some identity,


1022
01:13:33.918 --> 01:13:38.255
he said to me, "You want identity,
go build a bridge, invent penicillin.


1023
01:13:38.288 --> 01:13:40.958
Just get off my back."

1024
01:13:40.991 --> 01:13:44.661
I always said Harry had a
good head on his shoulders.


1025
01:13:44.694 --> 01:13:48.899
That was supposed to be
the bad story about him.


1026
01:13:49.666 --> 01:13:52.536
How's Helen?

1027
01:13:52.569 --> 01:13:55.539
Helen's fine, just fine.

1028
01:13:55.572 --> 01:14:00.911
Hmm. Why don't you tell me a story that
shows how really rotten she can be?


1029
01:14:02.212 --> 01:14:04.414
That's not like you.

1030
01:14:04.448 --> 01:14:07.584
I know, but it seems like we need
something to bring us together.


1031
01:14:07.617 --> 01:14:12.656
I thought a really lousy story about
Helen would make you appreciate me more.


1032
01:14:14.992 --> 01:14:19.696
Okay. As you know,
she has this funny sense of humor.


1033
01:14:19.729 --> 01:14:22.332
By funny,
I take it you mean peculiar. Right.


1034
01:14:22.366 --> 01:14:26.036
And it comes out
at the most inappropriate times.


1035
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:30.707
I had just signed this client...
very proper, very old money.


1036
01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:35.179
Helen and I were invited to his house
for cocktails with him and his wife.


1037
01:14:35.212 --> 01:14:38.015
Well, it was all pretty awkward,

1038
01:14:38.048 --> 01:14:41.285
but we managed to get
through the drinks all right.


1039
01:14:41.318 --> 01:14:45.389
Then, as we were leaving,
instead of walking out the front door,


1040
01:14:45.422 --> 01:14:48.993
I walked into the hall closet.

1041
01:14:49.026 --> 01:14:53.063
Well, that wasn't so bad.
Anybody could've done that.


1042
01:14:53.097 --> 01:14:56.666
My mistake was
I stayed in there.


1043
01:14:57.667 --> 01:15:01.605
You stayed in the closet?

1044
01:15:01.638 --> 01:15:04.674
I wasn't sure anybody
had seen me go in. Aha.


1045
01:15:04.708 --> 01:15:08.312
I guess I figured I'd stay in
there until they'd all gone away.


1046
01:15:08.345 --> 01:15:12.182
All right. Maybe
I didn't think things through.


1047
01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:17.121
I was there a minute before I realized
I had probably misjudged the situation.


1048
01:15:17.154 --> 01:15:21.125
And then when I came out,
the three of them were just staring at me.


1049
01:15:21.158 --> 01:15:22.715
Well, it was pretty awkward,

1050
01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:26.163
but I probably could've carried
it off except for Helen.


1051
01:15:26.196 --> 01:15:29.733
- You know what she did?
- What?


1052
01:15:31.135 --> 01:15:34.704
She peed on the carpet.

1053
01:15:37.641 --> 01:15:41.678
She did what?
Well, not right away.


1054
01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:44.548
First, she started to laugh.

1055
01:15:44.581 --> 01:15:48.085
Her face was all screwed up.
She was holding her sides.


1056
01:15:48.118 --> 01:15:52.989
Tears were streaming down her cheeks.
And then she peed all over the carpet.


1057
01:15:54.291 --> 01:15:57.327
What did you say?

1058
01:15:57.361 --> 01:15:59.396
I said, "You'll have to
excuse my wife.


1059
01:15:59.429 --> 01:16:02.266
Ever since her last pregnancy,
she's had a problem."


1060
01:16:02.299 --> 01:16:05.035
Then I offered
to have the rug cleaned.


1061
01:16:05.069 --> 01:16:06.412
Did that help?

1062
01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:10.464
No. They said they had a maid,
and it wouldn't be necessary.


1063
01:16:18.582 --> 01:16:22.086
You think this is funny?
Listen.


1064
01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:26.623
I've been meaning to tell
you this for a long time.


1065
01:16:26.656 --> 01:16:30.160
I just love Helen.

1066
01:16:32.862 --> 01:16:36.666
Would she come off any worse if
I told you I lost the account?


1067
01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:40.670
Oh, George, when
did you get so stuffy?


1068
01:16:40.704 --> 01:16:44.708
Stuffy?
Yeah.


1069
01:16:44.741 --> 01:16:48.812
Am I stuffy because I don't like my
wife to urinate on my client's carpet?


1070
01:16:50.547 --> 01:16:53.783
Well, I didn't mean
just that, honey, but...


1071
01:16:53.817 --> 01:16:58.255
Well, look at you.
You just scream establishment.


1072
01:16:58.288 --> 01:17:01.858
I am not a faddist.

1073
01:17:01.891 --> 01:17:02.834
What do you mean?

1074
01:17:02.859 --> 01:17:05.662
I mean I have no desire to
be those middle-aged idiots...


1075
01:17:05.695 --> 01:17:09.133
who walk around in bell-bottomed
trousers and Prince Valiant haircuts...


1076
01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.535
saying "ciao."

1077
01:17:11.568 --> 01:17:16.740
Well, I wasn't just talking about fashion.
I was talking about your attitudes.


1078
01:17:16.773 --> 01:17:20.244
My attitudes are the same as they
always were. I haven't changed at all.


1079
01:17:20.277 --> 01:17:24.548
Oh, yes, you have. You used to be kind
of, well, crazy and insecure...


1080
01:17:24.581 --> 01:17:28.852
and a terrible liar,
but awfully human.


1081
01:17:28.885 --> 01:17:32.622
Now you... I don't know.
You just seem so sure of yourself.


1082
01:17:37.161 --> 01:17:41.131
- That's the last thing I am.
- Oh, yeah?


1083
01:17:41.165 --> 01:17:44.834
I picked up one of Helen's magazines the
other day, and there was this article...


1084
01:17:44.868 --> 01:17:49.173
telling women what sort
of orgasms they should have.


1085
01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:52.476
It was called "The Big 'O.'"

1086
01:17:52.509 --> 01:17:55.379
You know what really
got me about that?


1087
01:17:55.412 --> 01:17:59.316
This was a magazine my mother used
to buy for its fruitcake recipes.


1088
01:17:59.349 --> 01:18:02.919
Well, the times, in fact,
are a-changing, darling.


1089
01:18:02.952 --> 01:18:05.822
Too fast.

1090
01:18:07.891 --> 01:18:12.462
I don't know.
Twenty, thirty years ago, we had standards.


1091
01:18:12.496 --> 01:18:15.899
Maybe they were black and white,
but at least they were standards.


1092
01:18:15.932 --> 01:18:17.867
Now...

1093
01:18:20.304 --> 01:18:23.207
It's so confusing.

1094
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:28.645
Well...

1095
01:18:28.678 --> 01:18:32.716
That's at least a step
in the right direction.


1096
01:18:34.384 --> 01:18:37.454
When did I suddenly
become so appealing?


1097
01:18:37.487 --> 01:18:41.458
When you went
from pompous to confused.


1098
01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:49.966
All right.
Now, tell me, sir.


1099
01:18:49.999 --> 01:18:52.336
What's your pleasure?

1100
01:18:52.369 --> 01:18:56.206
A walk by the ocean...

1101
01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:59.676
or a good book...

1102
01:18:59.709 --> 01:19:01.611
or...

1103
01:19:03.012 --> 01:19:05.315
me?

1104
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:11.288
You.
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.


1105
01:19:17.327 --> 01:19:19.729
What?

1106
01:19:19.763 --> 01:19:24.301
Doris, you're not wearing a bra.

1107
01:19:24.334 --> 01:19:28.705
George, you're so 40s.

1108
01:19:28.738 --> 01:19:31.375
I'm a very old-fashioned man.

1109
01:19:31.408 --> 01:19:35.412
Next, you'll be telling me
you voted for Goldwater.


1110
01:19:35.445 --> 01:19:37.414
I did.

1111
01:19:38.515 --> 01:19:41.385
You're putting me on.

1112
01:19:41.418 --> 01:19:44.654
No. Of course not.

1113
01:19:44.688 --> 01:19:46.656
What are you doing?

1114
01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:50.894
If you think I'm going to bed with any
son of a bitch who voted for Goldwater,


1115
01:19:50.927 --> 01:19:52.996
you're crazy.

1116
01:19:53.029 --> 01:19:56.366
Doris, don't do this to me.
Not now.


1117
01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:00.437
How could you vote for
a man like that? Yuck!


1118
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:04.274
Can we discuss this later? No.
We'll discuss it right now.


1119
01:20:04.308 --> 01:20:05.817
Why did you vote for him?

1120
01:20:05.842 --> 01:20:09.379
Because I have a son who
wants to be a rock musician.


1121
01:20:09.413 --> 01:20:13.317
What kind of reason is that? The best
one I can come up with in my condition.


1122
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:16.420
I'm sorry, George, you're gonna have
to do a whole lot better than that.


1123
01:20:16.453 --> 01:20:20.424
All right. He wanted to end the war, okay?
Sure, by destroying the country.


1124
01:20:20.457 --> 01:20:23.593
He never said that. That's the trouble
with you people. You never listen.


1125
01:20:23.627 --> 01:20:26.696
It's a civil war. We have no right
being there in the first place.


1126
01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:29.333
Oh, I'm so sick
of hearing that liberal crap.


1127
01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:32.769
We have the bomb. Why don't we use it?
Are you serious?


1128
01:20:32.802 --> 01:20:37.441
You're damned right I am. Wipe the sons
of bitches off the face of the earth.


1129
01:20:37.474 --> 01:20:41.678
Oh, my God!
I don't know anything about you!


1130
01:20:41.711 --> 01:20:45.749
- What kind of man are you?
- Right now, a very frustrated one.


1131
01:20:45.782 --> 01:20:50.320
All this time, I thought I was going
to bed with a liberal Democrat.


1132
01:20:50.354 --> 01:20:52.989
Wait a minute.
You told me you worked for Stevenson.


1133
01:20:53.022 --> 01:20:56.092
That was years ago. So what happened?
What changed you?


1134
01:20:56.125 --> 01:20:59.329
I grew up. Oh, yeah?
Well, as far as I'm concerned,


1135
01:20:59.363 --> 01:21:02.466
you didn't turn out too hot.

1136
01:21:08.438 --> 01:21:11.775
Let's just forget it, huh?
Oh, I'm not gonna forget it!


1137
01:21:11.808 --> 01:21:16.413
I mean, being stuffy and old-fashioned is
one thing, but being a fascist is another.


1138
01:21:16.446 --> 01:21:20.049
I am not a fascist!
Well, you're advocating mass murder!


1139
01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:23.653
Let's just drop it.
No, I'm not... I'm not going to drop it.


1140
01:21:23.687 --> 01:21:25.722
You stand for everything
that I'm against.


1141
01:21:25.755 --> 01:21:29.526
Maybe you're against the wrong things.
But you used to believe as I do.


1142
01:21:29.559 --> 01:21:31.528
Now, what happened?
I changed!


1143
01:21:31.561 --> 01:21:35.665
But why?
Because Michael was killed!


1144
01:21:42.539 --> 01:21:44.674
How?

1145
01:21:48.945 --> 01:21:53.950
He was helping a wounded man onto a Red
Cross helicopter, and a sniper killed him.


1146
01:21:58.755 --> 01:22:02.158
When?

1147
01:22:07.531 --> 01:22:11.401
We got word during
a Fourth of July party.


1148
01:22:15.505 --> 01:22:19.609
Helen went completely to pieces.

1149
01:22:29.553 --> 01:22:34.824
I thought I was in shock and
that I'd feel it later, you know?


1150
01:22:39.062 --> 01:22:41.965
I never did.

1151
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:50.640
I've never shed a tear.

1152
01:22:53.477 --> 01:22:57.581
All I've ever been able
to feel is blind anger.


1153
01:22:59.248 --> 01:23:03.887
I never shed a tear.

1154
01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.790
Isn't that something?

1155
01:23:09.493 --> 01:23:14.163
He was my son.
I love him.


1156
01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:20.604
And for the life of me...

1157
01:23:24.073 --> 01:23:26.876
I can't seem to cry for him.

1158
01:23:26.910 --> 01:23:28.712
Oh.

1159
01:23:42.258 --> 01:23:45.695
Doris, I'm sorry.
No.


1160
01:23:47.531 --> 01:23:50.767
About... About everything.

1161
01:23:55.605 --> 01:24:00.043
I've been a bit on edge lately.

1162
01:24:01.645 --> 01:24:05.582
Just seems to be one damn...

1163
01:24:33.042 --> 01:24:37.180
♪ Dreams make promises

1164
01:24:37.213 --> 01:24:40.283

01:24:40.316 --> 01:24:42.786

01:25:17.754 --> 01:25:23.660
You know, it's amazing how good it
can be after 21 years, isn't it?


1175
01:25:25.695 --> 01:25:31.100
Well, if you add up all the times
we actually made it together,


1176
01:25:32.168 --> 01:25:35.271
we're still on our honeymoon.

1177
01:25:37.306 --> 01:25:41.745
Did I tell you I'm a grandmother?
No.


1178
01:25:41.778 --> 01:25:44.313
But I think you picked a
weird time to announce it.


1179
01:25:47.416 --> 01:25:50.987
Congratulations.
Thank you.


1180
01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:53.677
Anyway, you're the
youngest-looking grandmother


1181
01:25:53.702 --> 01:25:55.725
I've had a peak experience with.

1182
01:25:55.759 --> 01:25:59.395
Well, my mother thanks you.
My father thanks you.


1183
01:25:59.428 --> 01:26:04.167
My hairdresser thanks you.
And my plastic surgeon thanks you.


1184
01:26:06.102 --> 01:26:12.175
When Harry says, "You're not the girl I
married," he doesn't know how right he is.


1185
01:26:12.208 --> 01:26:15.011
Didn't Harry like your old nose?

1186
01:26:15.044 --> 01:26:18.181
Harry thinks
this is my old nose.


1187
01:26:18.214 --> 01:26:21.084
He never noticed? No.
Isn't that pathetic?


1188
01:26:21.117 --> 01:26:25.789
I mean, a new dress or something,
I could understand, but a whole nose?


1189
01:26:25.822 --> 01:26:28.925
Well, to be totally honest,
I don't see any difference either.


1190
01:26:28.958 --> 01:26:32.996
Well, I don't care.
It's sure different from my side.


1191
01:26:33.029 --> 01:26:36.432
Makes me feel more attractive.

1192
01:26:36.465 --> 01:26:39.903
Anyway, that's this year's
bad story about Harry.


1193
01:26:39.936 --> 01:26:42.772
Have you got one about Helen?

1194
01:26:42.806 --> 01:26:46.843
Well, there was
this loud party next door.


1195
01:26:46.876 --> 01:26:49.946
Helen couldn't sleep.

1196
01:26:49.979 --> 01:26:53.850
And, uh, she didn't wanna
take a sleeping pill...


1197
01:26:53.883 --> 01:26:59.088
because she had to get up
at 6:00 in the morning.


1198
01:26:59.122 --> 01:27:03.226
So she took a couple of pills
and stuffed them in her ears.


1199
01:27:03.259 --> 01:27:05.895
What?

1200
01:27:05.929 --> 01:27:09.032
During the night,
the pills melted.


1201
01:27:09.065 --> 01:27:12.435
Then the next day, while the doctor
was digging the stuff out of her ears,


1202
01:27:12.468 --> 01:27:16.773
he said, "You know,
these can be taken orally."


1203
01:27:18.474 --> 01:27:22.311
Helen just laughed.
She didn't care.


1204
01:27:22.345 --> 01:27:26.015
I'll tell you something. If that's the
worst story you can tell about your wife,


1205
01:27:26.049 --> 01:27:28.317
you must be a very happy man.

1206
01:27:28.351 --> 01:27:31.454
Well, let's just say I've discovered
the potential for happiness.


1207
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:43.066
Yes, Liz?

1208
01:27:44.868 --> 01:27:48.872
No, honey.
It's 60 guests, not 16.


1209
01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:55.845
There's no problem. We've catered
parties for her lots of times. It...


1210
01:27:55.879 --> 01:27:58.481
I know, but she puts little
tables around her swimming pool,


1211
01:27:58.514 --> 01:28:01.985
and then there's room
on the patio for the buffet.


1212
01:28:02.018 --> 01:28:05.021
Right.
It's a brunch.


1213
01:28:05.054 --> 01:28:09.125
Right. That's okay.
Sure.


1214
01:28:09.158 --> 01:28:12.061
Uh, Liz, did Harry call?

1215
01:28:16.866 --> 01:28:20.069
Okay. You know
where to reach me, huh?


1216
01:28:24.073 --> 01:28:28.077
I'm sorry. It was a busy weekend,
and I had to leave a number.


1217
01:28:28.111 --> 01:28:32.982
Does Harry know you're here? No.
Harry still thinks I go on retreat.


1218
01:28:33.016 --> 01:28:34.984
Don't worry.

1219
01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:38.421
I'm not worried. Yeah?
Then why are you frowning?


1220
01:28:38.454 --> 01:28:42.058
I'm getting bad vibes again.
Again?


1221
01:28:42.091 --> 01:28:47.363
Yeah. When you first walked in,
I picked up on your high tension level.


1222
01:28:47.396 --> 01:28:50.499
Then after we made love,
I sensed a certain anxiety reduction,


1223
01:28:50.533 --> 01:28:56.039
but, uh, now I'm getting
definite negative feedback.


1224
01:28:56.072 --> 01:28:58.141
When did you go into analysis?

1225
01:28:58.174 --> 01:29:02.445
- How did you know I was in analysis?
- Just a wild guess.


1226
01:29:02.478 --> 01:29:05.882
What made you start?

1227
01:29:05.915 --> 01:29:10.219
My value system changed. One day,
I took a look at my $150,000 house...


1228
01:29:10.253 --> 01:29:15.925
and the three cars in the garage and
the swimming pool and the gardeners,


1229
01:29:15.959 --> 01:29:19.195
and I asked myself, "Why?"

1230
01:29:19.228 --> 01:29:23.166
I mean, did I really
want the whole status trip?


1231
01:29:23.199 --> 01:29:27.871
So I decided to try to find out
what I did want and who I was.


1232
01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:31.207
So you went from analysis
to Esalen to Gestalt...


1233
01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:35.611
to encounter groups to
transactional to nirvana, huh?


1234
01:29:35.644 --> 01:29:39.248
Just because some people are trying
to widen their emotional horizons...


1235
01:29:39.282 --> 01:29:41.851
doesn't make the experience
any less valid.


1236
01:29:41.885 --> 01:29:44.253
I've learned a lot.
So I've noticed.


1237
01:29:44.287 --> 01:29:48.257
For one thing, you've learned to talk as
though you're reasoning with somebody...


1238
01:29:48.291 --> 01:29:51.260
about to jump from a high ledge.

1239
01:29:51.294 --> 01:29:56.032
Okay, okay. I know sometimes I tend
to overcompensate for my emotionalism.


1240
01:29:58.134 --> 01:30:01.971
Occasionally, there's a loss of
spontaneity. I'm working on that.


1241
01:30:02.005 --> 01:30:06.142
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
What else have you learned?


1242
01:30:08.177 --> 01:30:11.614
That behind the walls
I've built around myself,


1243
01:30:11.647 --> 01:30:15.384
I'm a warm, caring,
loving human being.


1244
01:30:15.418 --> 01:30:19.088
Well, I could've
told you that 20 years ago.


1245
01:30:21.090 --> 01:30:25.261
Tell me. How's Helen reacting to
your voyage of self-discovery?


1246
01:30:25.294 --> 01:30:28.898
Well, at first, she tended to overreact.
Oh, yeah? In what way?


1247
01:30:28.932 --> 01:30:32.168
She threw a grapefruit
at me in the supermarket.


1248
01:30:32.201 --> 01:30:33.561
Listen.

1249
01:30:33.586 --> 01:30:37.640
It's only natural that there'd be some
interpersonal conflicts to work through,


1250
01:30:37.673 --> 01:30:41.010
but now it's cool.

1251
01:30:41.044 --> 01:30:45.148
- Helen's into pottery.
- Oh. And what are you doing for a living?


1252
01:30:45.181 --> 01:30:48.284
We live very simply, Doris.

1253
01:30:48.317 --> 01:30:54.123
We don't need much. What bread we do need,
I can provide by simple, honest labor.


1254
01:30:54.157 --> 01:30:57.360
Like what? I play cocktail piano
in a singles bar in the Valley.


1255
01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:10.206
Yes, Liz?

1256
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:18.514
No. No.
Tell 'em that's our final offer.


1257
01:31:18.547 --> 01:31:21.284
Oh, that's a lot of bull.
I know it's a good piece of property,


1258
01:31:21.317 --> 01:31:25.254
but he needs us
more than we need him.


1259
01:31:25.288 --> 01:31:29.692
Well, if he doesn't like it, tell him
to shove it. And don't worry. He won't.


1260
01:31:31.627 --> 01:31:35.564
Okay, hon. Thanks.
Anything else?


1261
01:31:35.598 --> 01:31:38.734
All right. Well,
I'll be at this number.


1262
01:31:38.767 --> 01:31:41.170
Okay.

1263
01:31:42.305 --> 01:31:45.975
I'm buying another store.
Why?


1264
01:31:46.009 --> 01:31:47.060
Money.

1265
01:31:47.085 --> 01:31:50.213
Is that why you went into business?
To make money?


1266
01:31:50.246 --> 01:31:55.318
No. I wanted power too.
I take it you are for women's liberation?


1267
01:31:55.351 --> 01:31:59.388
- Hey, I'm for any kind of liberation.
- That's a cop-out.


1268
01:31:59.422 --> 01:32:03.159
Women have always been exploited
by men, and you know it.


1269
01:32:03.192 --> 01:32:09.065
Doris, we've all been shafted,
and by the same things.


1270
01:32:09.098 --> 01:32:13.336
Look. Let me lay this on you.
I go to a woman doctor.


1271
01:32:13.369 --> 01:32:16.605
Oh, yeah? First time she
gave me a rectal examination,


1272
01:32:16.639 --> 01:32:21.210
she said, "Am I hurting
you or are you tense?"


1273
01:32:21.244 --> 01:32:25.448
I said, "I'm tense." She said,
"Are you tense because I'm a woman?"


1274
01:32:25.481 --> 01:32:29.718
I said, "No. I get tense when
anybody does that to me."


1275
01:32:29.752 --> 01:32:33.122
See what I mean?
Well, I don't know about that,


1276
01:32:33.156 --> 01:32:36.325
but I do know in this country,
nobody takes a woman seriously...


1277
01:32:36.359 --> 01:32:39.395
until she has enough money
to back up her mouth.


1278
01:32:39.428 --> 01:32:41.797
Hey, I think
it's great to have a hobby.


1279
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:44.800
A hobby?

1280
01:32:44.833 --> 01:32:48.437
We grossed a half
million the first year.


1281
01:32:48.471 --> 01:32:52.741
Doris, don't misunderstand me. If that's
what you want, I'm very happy for you.


1282
01:32:54.177 --> 01:32:57.313
I'm just not
into the money thing anymore.


1283
01:32:58.681 --> 01:33:02.151
Do you ever get the feeling
that we're drifting apart?


1284
01:33:02.185 --> 01:33:05.521
No. In many ways,
I've never felt closer to you.


1285
01:33:05.554 --> 01:33:11.427
I don't know. Somehow it seems
to me our lives are out of synch.


1286
01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:15.664
Look. We all realize our potential
in different ways at different times.


1287
01:33:15.698 --> 01:33:19.202
The important thing is, does what you
do give you a sense of fulfillment?


1288
01:33:19.235 --> 01:33:23.106
Well, I'm working on it.
And you have everything you want?


1289
01:33:23.139 --> 01:33:26.075
With one minor exception.

1290
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:30.846
Somewhere along the way,
I seem to have lost my husband.


1291
01:33:30.879 --> 01:33:35.384
- Lost him?
- Well, I don't know if I lost him...


1292
01:33:35.418 --> 01:33:37.720
or I simply misplaced him.

1293
01:33:37.753 --> 01:33:42.225
He left home four days ago,
and I haven't heard from him since.


1294
01:33:42.258 --> 01:33:46.629
How do you feel about that?
George, do me a favor.


1295
01:33:46.662 --> 01:33:50.158
Stop talking as though you're
leading a human potential group.


1296
01:33:50.183 --> 01:33:51.767
It really pisses me off.

1297
01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.837
That's cool.
What's cool?


1298
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:59.108
For you to transfer your feelings of
hostility and aggression from Harry to me.


1299
01:33:59.142 --> 01:34:02.511
As long as you know that's what
you're doing. You know something?


1300
01:34:02.545 --> 01:34:05.381
You're really beginning
to get on my nerves.


1301
01:34:05.414 --> 01:34:08.651
That's cool too.
Jesus.


1302
01:34:08.684 --> 01:34:14.657
I mean it. At least it's honest.
Total honesty is the key to everything.


1303
01:34:14.690 --> 01:34:16.859
Really? Are you being
totally honest with Helen?


1304
01:34:16.892 --> 01:34:21.564
- I'm trying.
- Oh, yeah? Have you told her about us?


1305
01:34:21.597 --> 01:34:24.800
No, but I could. I think today
she's mature enough to handle it.


1306
01:34:24.833 --> 01:34:26.869
George, you're full of shit.

1307
01:34:31.574 --> 01:34:34.910
I can buy that.

1308
01:34:34.943 --> 01:34:38.614
I mean,
if you're being totally honest.


1309
01:34:38.647 --> 01:34:42.518
Believe me. I am
being totally honest.


1310
01:34:44.787 --> 01:34:47.790
Well, at least it's a start.

1311
01:34:47.823 --> 01:34:50.926
And what about
all that other garbage?


1312
01:34:50.959 --> 01:34:54.697
"I don't know if I lost him
or simply misplaced him."


1313
01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:59.902
What kind of crap is that?
All right. You've got a point.


1314
01:34:59.935 --> 01:35:03.706
So how do you feel about all this?
You're doing it again!


1315
01:35:03.739 --> 01:35:07.876
Okay. I think...
Don't tell me how you think.


1316
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:11.880
Tell me how you feel.

1317
01:35:11.914 --> 01:35:15.318
Like I've been kicked
in the stomach.


1318
01:35:15.351 --> 01:35:17.520
What else?

1319
01:35:18.921 --> 01:35:24.927
Angry. Hurt. Betrayed.

1320
01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:28.331
And, okay, a little guilty.
But I'll tell you something.


1321
01:35:28.364 --> 01:35:31.434
I really resent the fact that
he's making me feel guilty.


1322
01:35:31.467 --> 01:35:33.869
Why do you feel resentment?

1323
01:35:33.902 --> 01:35:37.973
Well, look. I didn't marry Harry
because he had a good head for business.


1324
01:35:38.006 --> 01:35:42.345
Okay. So it turns out that I do,
or maybe I was lucky. I don't know.


1325
01:35:42.378 --> 01:35:48.284
The point is, I don't love him any less
just 'cause he's a failure as a provider,


1326
01:35:48.317 --> 01:35:52.855
so why should he love me less
just 'cause I'm a success?


1327
01:35:52.888 --> 01:35:55.758
Have you told him you still love him?
Love him.


1328
01:35:57.593 --> 01:36:01.397
What's he think I've been
hanging around for 27 years for?


1329
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:04.933
Would it be so hard to let him
know you understand how he feels?


1330
01:36:04.967 --> 01:36:07.836
Right now it would, yes.

1331
01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:10.373
Do you want him back?

1332
01:36:11.874 --> 01:36:15.344
I don't know.

1333
01:36:15.378 --> 01:36:19.615
But ask me again tomorrow, and I'll
probably give you a different answer.


1334
01:36:19.648 --> 01:36:21.484
Why?

1335
01:36:23.786 --> 01:36:26.889
Because tomorrow
I won't have you.


1336
01:36:33.429 --> 01:36:38.301
- I'm always with you in spirit.
- Thanks a lot.


1337
01:36:38.334 --> 01:36:42.671
It's kind of difficult to put your
cold feet on somebody's spirit,


1338
01:36:42.705 --> 01:36:45.741
especially when
they're 400 miles away.


1339
01:36:50.078 --> 01:36:54.883
Is that a proposal, Doris?

1340
01:36:54.917 --> 01:36:59.588
Are you interested?
Are you?


1341
01:37:02.391 --> 01:37:05.428
I've always thought
we'd make a nice couple.


1342
01:37:06.795 --> 01:37:08.964
You didn't answer the question.

1343
01:37:08.997 --> 01:37:12.601
I was the one who proposed.

1344
01:37:15.604 --> 01:37:18.641
Well, don't look
so panicky, George.


1345
01:37:18.674 --> 01:37:22.378
I was only
three-quarters serious.


1346
01:37:26.749 --> 01:37:30.486
Well, when you're completely
serious, ask me again.


1347
01:37:30.519 --> 01:37:34.623
I bet you say that
to all the girls.


1348
01:37:34.657 --> 01:37:36.559
No.

1349
01:37:41.697 --> 01:37:45.634
Thank you.
You hungry?


1350
01:37:45.668 --> 01:37:48.937
Yes.
Well, you're in luck.


1351
01:37:48.971 --> 01:37:53.642
Because today, your lunch is
being catered by the chicest,


1352
01:37:53.676 --> 01:37:57.580
most expensive French delicatessen
in all of San Francisco.


1353
01:37:57.613 --> 01:38:01.517
How did we swing that?
The owner's got a thing for ya.


1354
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:04.353
It's out in the trunk of my car.
Can I help?


1355
01:38:04.387 --> 01:38:07.590
Why, you could set the table
and turn on some nice music...


1356
01:38:07.623 --> 01:38:09.658
and when I come back,
make me laugh, huh?


1357
01:38:09.692 --> 01:38:12.461
I'll try.
Don't worry.


1358
01:38:12.495 --> 01:38:16.331
If you can't make me
laugh, just hold my hand.


1359
01:38:38.086 --> 01:38:40.889
Hello?

1360
01:38:40.923 --> 01:38:44.660
Uh, no, she's not here
right now. Who's this?


1361
01:38:47.162 --> 01:38:50.132
Harry? Um...

1362
01:38:50.165 --> 01:38:55.037
Uh, would you... would you just
hold on for a minute, please?


1363
01:39:08.984 --> 01:39:10.986
Hello?

1364
01:39:12.688 --> 01:39:16.892
Harry, we're two mature adult human
beings, and I've decided to be honest.


1365
01:39:18.994 --> 01:39:22.931
No. Doris is not here right now,
but I'd like to talk to you.


1366
01:39:24.833 --> 01:39:26.502
Because I know
that you and Doris


1367
01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:29.128
are having a pretty rough
time right now, and...


1368
01:39:31.574 --> 01:39:35.010
Uh, we're very close friends.

1369
01:39:35.043 --> 01:39:39.014
I've known Doris for 20 years,
and I feel that through her, I know you.


1370
01:39:42.718 --> 01:39:46.188
We've been meeting this
same weekend for 20 years.


1371
01:39:50.192 --> 01:39:54.096
The retreat?
Uh, yeah.


1372
01:39:54.129 --> 01:39:58.233
I'll, uh... I'll get to
that in a minute, but, um,


1373
01:39:58.266 --> 01:40:01.637
first I'd like to tell you
something, Harry.


1374
01:40:01.670 --> 01:40:04.507
She loves you.

1375
01:40:04.540 --> 01:40:09.812
Well, I just know. Look. Maybe if I told
you a story she told me this morning,


1376
01:40:09.845 --> 01:40:12.581
maybe it would help you
understand.


1377
01:40:12.615 --> 01:40:17.953
Uh, a few months ago,
Doris was supposed to act as den mother...


1378
01:40:17.986 --> 01:40:22.224
for your 10-year-old daughter
and her Indian Guide group.


1379
01:40:22.257 --> 01:40:26.762
And Doris was a little late.
She was hung up at the store,


1380
01:40:26.795 --> 01:40:29.131
and she got home
about two hours late.


1381
01:40:29.164 --> 01:40:30.958
When she walked into the house,

1382
01:40:30.983 --> 01:40:34.603
she looked in the living room,
and you know what she saw?


1383
01:40:34.637 --> 01:40:38.841
A rather overweight, balding, middle-aged
man with a feather on his head...


1384
01:40:38.874 --> 01:40:43.011
sitting cross-legged on the
floor, very gravely and gently...


1385
01:40:43.045 --> 01:40:46.749
telling a circle of totally
absorbed girls what it was like...


1386
01:40:46.782 --> 01:40:50.719
to be in a World War II
Japanese prison camp.


1387
01:40:52.655 --> 01:40:57.025
And she turned around and went
outside and got in her car...


1388
01:40:57.059 --> 01:41:00.963
and thanked God for being
married to a man like you.


1389
01:41:05.968 --> 01:41:09.204
Are you still there, Harry?

1390
01:41:11.139 --> 01:41:17.145
Yeah, well, look. Sometimes married
people get into an emotional straitjacket,


1391
01:41:17.179 --> 01:41:22.050
and it's kind of hard for them to express
how they truly feel about each other.


1392
01:41:27.856 --> 01:41:32.227
Total honesty is the key.

1393
01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:34.830
Yes, I've known Doris
for 20 years,


1394
01:41:34.863 --> 01:41:38.033
and I'm not ashamed to admit that
it's been one of the most intimate,


1395
01:41:38.066 --> 01:41:41.970
satisfying experiences
of my life.


1396
01:41:43.071 --> 01:41:45.240
My name?

1397
01:41:49.277 --> 01:41:53.916
My name is
Father Michael O'Herlihy.


1398
01:41:53.949 --> 01:41:58.220
Right. Oh.

1399
01:42:51.807 --> 01:42:55.110
It never changes, does it?
About the only thing that doesn't.


1400
01:42:55.143 --> 01:42:58.814
I find that comforting.

1401
01:42:58.847 --> 01:43:01.650
Even old Chalmers
hasn't changed.


1402
01:43:01.684 --> 01:43:04.920
He must be 75 by now.

1403
01:43:04.953 --> 01:43:10.693
You remember when we first met?
Even then, we called him old Chalmers.


1404
01:43:10.726 --> 01:43:13.328
He must've been the same
age then that we are now.


1405
01:43:13.361 --> 01:43:17.099
That I don't find so comforting.

1406
01:43:17.132 --> 01:43:20.102
We were very young.
Yeah.


1407
01:43:20.135 --> 01:43:24.039
Have we changed much?
Oh, sure we have.


1408
01:43:24.072 --> 01:43:28.443
I grew up with you. Remember all
those dumb lies I used to tell?


1409
01:43:28.476 --> 01:43:32.414
Yeah. How about me?
Have I grown up too?


1410
01:43:32.447 --> 01:43:36.719
I had the feeling you were
already grown up when we met.


1411
01:43:41.023 --> 01:43:43.959
Why is it every time I look at you,
I want to put my hands all over you?


1412
01:43:43.992 --> 01:43:48.897
That's another thing that hasn't changed.
You always were a sex maniac.


1413
01:43:54.036 --> 01:43:57.940
I'll start a fire.
Okay.


1414
01:43:57.973 --> 01:44:00.275
You know, I figured out with
the cost of firewood today,


1415
01:44:00.308 --> 01:44:05.113
it's cheaper to buy furniture,
break it up and burn it.


1416
01:44:05.147 --> 01:44:09.051
Are things that tight?
No. I'm okay.


1417
01:44:09.084 --> 01:44:12.287
I've been doing some
teaching at U.C.I.A. Ah.


1418
01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:16.391
What? Music?
Accounting.


1419
01:44:16.424 --> 01:44:18.927
With the way things
are happening out there,


1420
01:44:18.961 --> 01:44:22.464
it seems that figures are still
the only things that don't lie.


1421
01:44:25.133 --> 01:44:26.969
Doris, why'd you
sell your business?


1422
01:44:29.004 --> 01:44:32.808
How did you know about that?
I'll tell you later.


1423
01:44:32.841 --> 01:44:37.279
What made you do it?
A chain bought me out.


1424
01:44:37.312 --> 01:44:40.816
It was just the right offer
at the right time.


1425
01:44:40.849 --> 01:44:46.421
But what do you do with yourself now?
Oh, I read and watch TV...


1426
01:44:46.454 --> 01:44:51.226
and visit my grandchildren,
play a little golf.


1427
01:44:51.259 --> 01:44:54.963
You know, all the jet set stuff.

1428
01:44:54.997 --> 01:44:57.766
I thought you loved working.

1429
01:44:57.800 --> 01:45:00.936
Well, there was another factor.

1430
01:45:00.969 --> 01:45:04.339
Harry had a heart attack.
It turned out to be a mild one,


1431
01:45:04.372 --> 01:45:07.509
but he needed me
at the time, so...


1432
01:45:07.542 --> 01:45:11.079
Besides, it's not like I'm
in permanent retirement.


1433
01:45:11.113 --> 01:45:15.517
There's a local election in a couple of
months, and I've been approached to run.


1434
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:18.987
On what ticket?
Independent.


1435
01:45:19.021 --> 01:45:21.423
Figures.

1436
01:45:21.456 --> 01:45:23.992
Harry's okay now?
Oh, yeah.


1437
01:45:24.026 --> 01:45:28.430
He runs four miles a day and
has a body like Mark Spitz.


1438
01:45:28.463 --> 01:45:33.401
Unfortunately, he still has a
face like Ernest Borgnine, but...


1439
01:45:36.338 --> 01:45:41.309
How's everything with you
and Harry emotionally?


1440
01:45:44.980 --> 01:45:47.983
Comfortable.
Comfortable?


1441
01:45:48.016 --> 01:45:50.986
Well, that's not such
a bad state to be in.


1442
01:45:51.019 --> 01:45:54.923
That word's been given a
bad reputation by the young.


1443
01:45:56.624 --> 01:46:00.528
Where's your luggage?
Still in the car?


1444
01:46:00.562 --> 01:46:04.332
I didn't bring any.
I can't stay.


1445
01:46:06.001 --> 01:46:09.071
Why not?
Look, I have a lot to say...


1446
01:46:09.104 --> 01:46:14.342
and a very short time to say
it, so I'd better start.


1447
01:46:14.376 --> 01:46:17.312
In the first place,
it turns out that...


1448
01:46:17.345 --> 01:46:20.248
Helen found out
about us 10 years ago.


1449
01:46:26.121 --> 01:46:30.425
When did you learn that?
Two months ago.


1450
01:46:32.227 --> 01:46:35.330
And she never confronted
you with it before?


1451
01:46:35.363 --> 01:46:39.134
No.
What made her tell you now?


1452
01:46:39.167 --> 01:46:43.271
She didn't. We have
a very close friend, Connie.


1453
01:46:43.305 --> 01:46:46.441
- Did... Have I ever mentioned her?
- No.


1454
01:46:46.474 --> 01:46:49.277
Well, Connie told me.

1455
01:46:49.311 --> 01:46:53.882
All those years,
and she never even hinted that she knew.


1456
01:46:58.386 --> 01:47:01.523
I guess that's the nicest
story I've ever told about her.


1457
01:47:01.556 --> 01:47:06.461
- Your wife is an amazing woman.
- She passed away, Doris.


1458
01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:16.171
I lost her six months ago.

1459
01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:21.043
It was very fast.

1460
01:47:25.047 --> 01:47:27.058
I'm sorry to blurt it out like that.

1461
01:47:27.083 --> 01:47:29.908
I couldn't think of a
graceful way to tell you.


1462
01:47:31.353 --> 01:47:34.289
It's so strange.

1463
01:47:34.322 --> 01:47:39.327
I never even met Helen, and I feel
like I've just lost my best friend.


1464
01:47:42.697 --> 01:47:46.368
Are the kids okay? The kids are great.
If it weren't for them,


1465
01:47:46.401 --> 01:47:50.105
I don't know if I'd have gotten
through this whole thing.


1466
01:47:50.138 --> 01:47:52.941
I wish you'd tried to reach me.
Well, I did.


1467
01:47:52.975 --> 01:47:55.978
That's how I found out
you'd sold the store.


1468
01:47:56.011 --> 01:47:59.581
They gave me
your home number, and I...


1469
01:47:59.614 --> 01:48:03.585
I let the phone ring four
times, and then I hung up.


1470
01:48:03.618 --> 01:48:06.321
But I felt better knowing you
were there if I needed you.


1471
01:48:06.354 --> 01:48:11.960
Oh, I wish you'd spoken to me.
Well, I didn't want to intrude.


1472
01:48:11.994 --> 01:48:15.497
I didn't think I had the right.

1473
01:48:15.530 --> 01:48:20.335
That's just terrible.
We should've been together.


1474
01:48:22.504 --> 01:48:26.208
You know, I've been thinking
about us a lot lately,


1475
01:48:27.675 --> 01:48:32.614
everything we've been through
together, things we've shared,


1476
01:48:32.647 --> 01:48:36.151
times we've helped each other.

1477
01:48:36.184 --> 01:48:39.454
Did you know we made love 113 times?
What?


1478
01:48:39.487 --> 01:48:45.227
I figured that out
on my Bomar calculator.


1479
01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:49.397
I think it's wonderful when
people know each other that well.


1480
01:48:49.431 --> 01:48:52.367
You know, there's nothing
about you I don't know.


1481
01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:55.603
You take two sugars, right?
No. One.


1482
01:48:55.637 --> 01:48:58.473
Okay. Uh...

1483
01:48:58.506 --> 01:49:02.510
Oh, well, okay.
Maybe I don't know everything about you.


1484
01:49:04.279 --> 01:49:07.515
You know, I don't know who
your favorite movie stars are.


1485
01:49:07.549 --> 01:49:10.585
And I couldn't remember the
name of your favorite perfume.


1486
01:49:10.618 --> 01:49:13.489
I racked my brain,
and I couldn't think of it.


1487
01:49:13.514 --> 01:49:14.589
That's funny.

1488
01:49:14.622 --> 01:49:16.591
It's My Sin.

1489
01:49:21.629 --> 01:49:26.068
But I do know that in 26 years,
I've never been out of love with you.


1490
01:49:27.635 --> 01:49:31.339
I think that's incredible.

1491
01:49:33.241 --> 01:49:37.345
- So what do you say, Doris?
- You wanna get married?


1492
01:49:37.379 --> 01:49:41.183
Married? We shouldn't
even be doing this.


1493
01:49:41.216 --> 01:49:43.685
I'm serious.

1494
01:49:47.622 --> 01:49:51.593
Oh, my God. You are.

1495
01:49:51.626 --> 01:49:56.364
Well, what'd you think I
was, just a summer romance?


1496
01:49:59.234 --> 01:50:02.470
A simple yes will do.

1497
01:50:03.738 --> 01:50:07.575
There is no such thing, my love.

1498
01:50:10.878 --> 01:50:14.249
What is it?

1499
01:50:14.282 --> 01:50:18.620
I was just thinking of how many times
I've dreamed of your asking me this.


1500
01:50:18.653 --> 01:50:24.526
You know, that's pulled me through a lot
of bad times. I wanna thank you for that.


1501
01:50:24.559 --> 01:50:27.629
What did you say
those other times?


1502
01:50:28.730 --> 01:50:31.799
I always said yes.

1503
01:50:31.833 --> 01:50:36.371
Why are you hesitating now? Do you realize
I'm offering you the opportunity...


1504
01:50:36.404 --> 01:50:39.374
to marry a man who has
known you for 26 years...


1505
01:50:39.407 --> 01:50:42.844
and can't walk by you without
wanting to grab your ass?


1506
01:50:42.877 --> 01:50:45.347
You always were a sweet talker.

1507
01:50:46.714 --> 01:50:48.783
Doris, will you marry me?

1508
01:50:52.787 --> 01:50:55.323
I can't.

1509
01:50:56.391 --> 01:50:58.526
Why not?

1510
01:51:01.696 --> 01:51:04.399
I'm already married.

1511
01:51:04.432 --> 01:51:07.635
You feel you have to stay
with him because he needs you?


1512
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:12.574
No. No.
It's a lot of things.


1513
01:51:13.741 --> 01:51:16.711
Affection.

1514
01:51:16.744 --> 01:51:19.447
Respect.

1515
01:51:19.481 --> 01:51:22.550
And a sense of continuity.

1516
01:51:22.584 --> 01:51:25.787
I mean, we share
all the same memories.


1517
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:30.492
It's comfortable.

1518
01:51:30.525 --> 01:51:36.331
Goddamn it. I was the one who brought
you back together six years ago.


1519
01:51:36.364 --> 01:51:39.634
Why did I do such a stupid thing?
Why was I so generous?


1520
01:51:39.667 --> 01:51:43.838
Because you felt the same way then about
Helen as I do now about Harry, that's why.


1521
01:51:43.871 --> 01:51:47.209
And besides, if you hadn't,
you might've been stuck with me for good,


1522
01:51:47.242 --> 01:51:50.245
and that idea
scared you to death.


1523
01:51:53.881 --> 01:51:57.585
You always could see through
me, couldn't you?


1524
01:51:57.619 --> 01:52:00.522
But that's okay, 'cause...

1525
01:52:01.756 --> 01:52:04.759
I've always loved
what I've seen.


1526
01:52:06.761 --> 01:52:10.232
Well, I want you now.

1527
01:52:12.534 --> 01:52:16.838
You can still have me once a
year, same time, same place.


1528
01:52:16.871 --> 01:52:19.774
Doris, I need a wife.

1529
01:52:21.309 --> 01:52:24.679
I'm just not the kind of man
who can live alone.


1530
01:52:24.712 --> 01:52:29.784
What I'm trying to say is that without
you, I'll probably end up with Connie.


1531
01:52:32.687 --> 01:52:36.724
Look, she knows all about us, and,
uh, she's not the kind of person...


1532
01:52:36.758 --> 01:52:40.595
who would go along with it.

1533
01:52:40.628 --> 01:52:43.731
I guess what I'm
trying to say is that...


1534
01:52:46.033 --> 01:52:49.271
we'll never
see each other again.


1535
01:53:03.518 --> 01:53:06.754
Doris, for God's sake, marry me.

1536
01:53:16.531 --> 01:53:18.700
I can't.

1537
01:53:27.309 --> 01:53:30.812
I wish there were something I
could say that would make you...


1538
01:53:30.845 --> 01:53:34.349
burst into tears
and run away with me.


1539
01:53:38.052 --> 01:53:42.824
Well, you know us Irish.
We never cry.


1540
01:53:45.927 --> 01:53:48.863
Yeah, well...

1541
01:53:52.367 --> 01:53:55.870
I have to catch a plane.

1542
01:54:07.048 --> 01:54:09.317
Who were
your favorite movie stars?


1543
01:54:13.388 --> 01:54:16.424
Laurence Olivier.

1544
01:54:16.458 --> 01:54:19.093
Marlon Brando.

1545
01:54:19.126 --> 01:54:21.463
Cary Grant.

1546
01:54:23.965 --> 01:54:26.300
Lon McCallister.

1547
01:56:02.730 --> 01:56:06.934
Okay. I'm back,
goddamn it.


1548
01:56:08.670 --> 01:56:12.707
- What about Connie?
- Connie is 87 years old.


1549
01:56:12.740 --> 01:56:15.843
What? Look.
I wanted you to marry me,


1550
01:56:15.877 --> 01:56:19.681
and I figured if you thought somebody
else wanted me, I'd stand a better chance.


1551
01:56:19.714 --> 01:56:23.585
Okay. Maybe I didn't
think things through.


1552
01:56:23.618 --> 01:56:26.654
I was desperate, okay?

1553
01:56:26.688 --> 01:56:30.157
Look. I don't even wanna discuss it.
I'm back, and I'm gonna keep coming back...


1554
01:56:30.191 --> 01:56:33.661
every year until our bones are
too brittle to risk contact.
