2001年穆罕默德•阿塔
在德國港口城市漢堡策劃了911恐怖攻擊


4
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.420
情報失誤和部門間內鬥使他和他的同夥

5
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.680
在未受察覺和干擾的情況下實施了襲擊

6
00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.930
如今 德國和國際情報部門在漢堡保持高度戒備

7
00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.690
決心不讓2001年悲劇再次發生

8
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.680
嗯
Yes.

我今天下午在機場接上了他

我知道
I know.


11
00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.800
你知道我需要什麼吧？
You know what I need?


12
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.780
相信我 賈馬爾

13
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.540
你做的是正義之事

14
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.730
你們害怕嗎 我的朋友們
Are you afraid, my friends?


15
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.240
怕我們嗎
Of us?


16
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.320
怕伊斯蘭嗎
Of Islam?


17
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.490
穆斯林世界的人們在受苦

18
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.520
在巴勒斯坦 在阿富汗 在巴格達

19
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.160
但是，能用恐怖主義
But do I believe terrorism


20
00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.080
為這些苦難作辯解嗎？
is the justifiable consequence of this suffering?


21
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.610
當然不能
No.


22
00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.520
用暴力對待無辜人群 這不是真主之道
Violence against the innocent is not the way of Allah.


23
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.370
我在世界各地的慈善機構
My charities are set up around the world


24
00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.770
為了消滅貧窮 也為了宣傳宗教寬容

31
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.840
說中央火車站有一個形跡可疑之人

32
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:03.570
警方收到了這張用手機拍的這張照片
They were sent this image taken from a mobile phone.


33
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.890

37
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:16.370
可能有暴力傾向
- Hmm. - Potentially violent.


38
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.610
小心靠近
Approach with caution.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.090
播放這一幅
Pull that down.


40
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.250
監控錄像拍到他在那一天

44
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.240
看手上動作
- Ah. Give me the hands. - Uh-huh.


45
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.200
是便條？
Some sort of note?


46
00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:31.920
可能是鈔票
Currency maybe.


47
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.570
這是我們最後一次見到他
That's our last sight of him.


48
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.130
還有誰知道他來了
Who else knows he's out there?


49
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.890
警方還沒查出來
The cops haven't made a connection.


50
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.610
樓上的部門呢
Mmm. And upstairs?


51
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.050
估計也沒有
Mmm-mmm, doesn't look like it.


52
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.730
他們很快也會的

62
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.490
這小子令人困惑

64
00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.280
他不是什麼人的兒子嗎

伊薩…弄不好是耶穌

66
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.160
也許他是上帝之子 來拯救我們的

67
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.120

68
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:26.900

Why make a four hour layover, in Cyprus,


83
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.040
為何在塞浦路斯停留了四小時

84
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.330
而沒有坐直飛的航班
When you can fly direct?


85
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:22.450
不知道 昆特 為了航空里程積分？

運氣好的話 可能真沒別的

88
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.930
你只有這麼多朋友？
Is that all you have, Günther?


89
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.530
連七個都沒有
Oh, I wish.

不要管他

114
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.600
那麼你們找到了他？

115
00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:25.850
我要提醒你 你們在漢堡的權限

假如這小子引爆炸彈呢

那你就要負責了 昆特
It's in your hands, Günther.


123
00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.170
幸虧這事不是你負責
Thank Christ it's not in yours


124
00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.610
因為那樣的話 你就砸了

One son, Melik.


143
00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:49.490
邁克爾的電話
Oh, Michael.


144
00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:52.890
他們正在申請成為德國公民
They have a citizenship application pending.


145
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:54.250
邁克爾
Michael.


146
00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.890
你得罪了穆爾
You've upset Dieter Mohr.


147
00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.330
是嗎
Really?


148
00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.650
這可能是因為
It probably has something to do


149
00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:01.890
你任由恐怖分子在漢堡逍遙法外
with the terrorists you're allowing to walk the streets of Hamburg.


150
00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:04.170
我們是為了盯梢
We're on a wait and see approach.


151
00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.800
盯到什麼了
And what are we seeing?


152
00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.610
還需要繼續盯梢下去
Enough to keep waiting.


153
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.120
別低估了穆爾
Don't underestimate Mohr.


154
00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.640
他在柏林有很多熟人
He's got a lot of friends here in Berlin.


155
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.810
你把那車臣人交給他就是了
Why don't you give him the Chechen?


156
00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.330
讓他出風頭 你專注于調查阿布杜拉就是了
Let him shine while you stay focused on Abdullah.


157
00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.570
我認為他在把錢轉移到一家船運公司
I think he's moving the money to a shipping company.


158
00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.890
你確定嗎
Are you sure?


159
00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.120
還不能完全確定 但差不多
Not yet, but close.


160
00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.130
我還需要一些時間
I need more time.


161
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.650
我會盡力的 昆特 但你也小心點
I'll do what I can, Günther, but watch your back.


162
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.050
據說美國人對此事也有興趣
Word is the Americans are taking an interest.


163
00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:35.440
謝謝提醒
Thanks for the warning.


164
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:43.610
美國人
Americans.


165
00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:55.290
昆特•巴克曼？
Günther Bachmann?


166
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:59.360
我是馬莎•蘇利文 美國駐柏林大使館的
Martha Sullivan. US Embassy, Berlin.


167
00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.770
我當然早已知道你的名聲
I know you by reputation, of course.


168
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.040
肯定不是好名聲
That can't be good.


169
00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.050
名聲好的人一般對我沒用
Men with good reputations usually aren't much use to me.


170
00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:11.160
那麼女人呢
What about women?


171
00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.690
這是我的同事伊娜•弗雷
This is my colleague Irna Frey.


172
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.770
-你好  -你好
- Hello. - Hello.


173
00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:18.600
她會帆船 也做間諜
She sails and spies.


174
00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.720
我不會帆船
I don't sail.


175
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.930
漢堡離柏林很遠
Hamburg's a long way from Berlin.


176
00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:26.090
你來此何事
What are you doing here?


177
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.640
我只是旁觀者
Me? I am just an observer.


178
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.650
我被美國人旁觀過
I have been observed by Americans before.


179
00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.280
結局一般都不好
It usually doesn't end well.


180
00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.210
據我聽說 我們不是那種
From what I'm hearing, we're not the ones


181
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.840
你需要防範的人
you need to be worrying about.


182
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.330
各位早上好
Good morning, everyone.


183
00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.320
穆爾先生編寫了一個報告
Herr Mohr has compiled a report.


184
00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.690
我們經過調查確認
Our investigations confirm


185
00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.330
伊薩•卡爾波夫
that Issa Karpov


186
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:55.320
是一個激進的車臣聖戰分子卡拉菲組織的成員
is a member of a militant Salafi group of Chechen jihadists.


187
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.330
今年早些時候 這一組織的頭目落網後
Karpov was arrested soon after the capture


188
00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.850
卡爾波夫不久後也被捕
of the group's leader earlier this year.


189
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.960
這一情報的來源是哪裡
Where did this information come from?


190
00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:08.240
我們在俄羅斯國家安全部門中有可靠的情報來源
We have excellent resources inside the Russian state security system.


191
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.490
經過24小時的審訊卡爾波夫承認
After 24 hours of questioning, Karpov confessed


192
00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:16.170
參與了襲擊煤氣管道
to taking part in attacks on gas pipelines,


193
00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.450
運輸部門、基礎設施、警察局
transport, infrastructure, police stations.


194
00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:21.610
被俄國人審訊24小時
After 24 hours of Russian questioning


195
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.130
我們任何人都能承認任何罪名
any one of us would admit to anything.


196
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.610
你是在質疑這份報告？
Are you contesting this report?


197
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.450
不是 是的
No. Yes.


198
00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.490
或許是
Maybe.


199
00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.850
我們還沒看過這報告
We've not yet had the benefit of reading it.


200
00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.690
這份報告認為 恐怖分子卡爾波夫來漢堡
The report concludes that the terrorist Karpov has come to Hamburg


201
00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:42.850
試圖與本市的伊斯蘭小組取得聯繫
seeking to make contact with Islamist cells operating in the city.


202
00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:44.050
他們就藏在我們中間
They hide among us.


203
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.730
-是嗎  -是的
- Really? - Yes.


204
00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:47.050
卡爾波夫是個通緝犯
Karpov is a wanted man.


205
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.490
如果你知道他的下落
If you have knowledge of his whereabouts,


206
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.690
你就要按照憲法規定的正當法律程序
you are obliged to follow due process under the constitution.


207
00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.720
你是說逮捕他？
You mean arresting him?


208
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.760
伊薩克•卡爾波夫的確在漢堡試圖取得聯繫
Issa Karpov is indeed seeking to make contact in Hamburg,


209
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.450
聯繫一個銀行家
with a banker.


210
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.250
你沒說過這事
We've had no briefing on this.


211
00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:07.730
假如你調查仔細 根本不用我說
Well, if you were doing your job, you wouldn't need one.


212
00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.770
我們不是警察
We're not policemen.


213
00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.850
我們是間諜 伊薩•卡爾波夫可能對我們有用
We're spies. Issa Karpov may be of value to us.


214
00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:14.650
我只要求再給一些時間
All I'm asking for is more time.


215
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:18.010
我們小組想在德國的伊斯蘭居民中
Our unit was set up to develop intelligence resources


216
00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:21.000
發展線人
inside Germany's Islamic community.


217
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.840
-我們正是為此來漢堡  -哦
- That's why we're here. - Oh.


218
00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:27.610
我以為你們來漢堡 是因為你們在貝魯特失敗了
And I thought you were here because you fucked up in Beirut


219
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.690
而你的朋友邁克爾•埃克斯羅完全不知道…
and your friend Michael Axelrod had no idea...


220
00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.330
這個銀行家 我們知道卡爾波夫為何找他嗎
This banker, do we know what Karpov wants from him?


221
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.930
還不知道 假如我們現在抓捕他
Not yet and if we move against him now,


222
00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:37.120
我們很可能永遠不會知道
the chances are we never will.


223
00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.250
我認為他是有道理的 奧托
I think he knows what he's doing, Otto.


224
00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:43.760
也許你該讓他繼續下去
Maybe you should let him get on with it.


225
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:50.210
限你72小時內
You have 72 hours to bring


226
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.650
把這事做個了斷
this matter to a resolution,


227
00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:56.290
否則 我們就會了斷 不管你們是否合作
if not, we will, with or without your co-operation.


228
00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:58.610
-好嗎  -好
- Okay? - Okay.


229
00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.650
我們該去哪兒
Where should we go?


230
00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.520
在街角那家飯店見面？
Meet at the place on the corner?


231
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.760
好
Okay.


232
00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.970
你們先走一步吧
Uh, I'll catch up with you later.


233
00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.480
好我們到那裡見
Okay, we'll see you there.


234
00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:24.480
梅裡克
Melik?


235
00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.920
我們有預約嗎
Did we have an appointment?


236
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.910
媽媽

237
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.650
這是安娜貝爾•裡克特
Annabel Richter, Mama.


238
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.290
你好 萊拉一向可好
Hello, Leyla. How are you?


239
00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.410
歡迎光臨寒舍 安娜貝爾夫人
Welcome to our house, Frau Annabel.


240
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:47.090
很高興再次見到你
Nice to see you again.


241
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.410
請進請進
Come in. Come in please.


242
00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.120
謝謝
Thank you.


243
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:57.320
這孩子是好人 安娜貝爾夫人 你知道嗎
The boy is good, Frau Annabel. Do you understand?


244
00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:01.100
假如他做了什麼錯事 那是因為他不知道…
If he has done something wrong, it's because he had no...


245
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.330
你好 伊薩
Hello, Issa.


246
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:14.010
我叫安娜貝爾•裡克特
Uh, my name is Annabel Richter.


247
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.570
我是個律師
I am a lawyer.


248
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:19.360
我和一個叫"北方避難所"的組織合作
I work with an organization called Sanctuary North.


249
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.880
-請坐  -好
- Mmm, please? - Okay.


250
00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.600
你來德國是尋求庇護嗎
Are you seeking asylum in Germany?


251
00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:34.560
我去泡咖啡
I make coffee.


252
00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.370
肯定是有原因的
There has to be a reason.


253
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:43.530
要麼你不能回你的祖國
Either you cannot return to your country of origin


254
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.890
因為那樣會有生命危險
because your life would be in danger


255
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.570
要麼你受到了迫害
or you have been tortured.


256
00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.160
是的
Yes.


257
00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.130
是哪個
Yes, what?


258
00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.440
我受到了迫害
I have been tortured.


259
00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.560
請原諒我 可這是我的職責
Forgive me, but this is my job.


260
00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.090
我也希望相信你 可很多人都聲稱受到迫害
I want to believe you, but people make this claim all the time.


261
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:01.930
我必須…
I have to...


262
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.450
是誰傷了你
Who did this to you?


263
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:22.040
俄國警察
Roosskie.


264
00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.480
你必須對我坦誠 我才能幫你
I cannot help you unless you are honest with me.


265
00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.130
德國當局找上你是遲早的事
It's only a matter of time before the German authorities will find you.


266
00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:32.290
最好是你主動找他們
It's better for your case if you go to them first.


267
00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:35.280
-我們可以正式的…  -我決不回俄國
- We can make a formal... - I will never, never go back to Russia.


268
00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.520
拜託
Please?


269
00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.680
你聯繫這個人
You will contact this man.


270
00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:45.120
他會幫助我
He will help me.


271
00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.650
湯姆•布魯先生
Mr. Thomas Brue.


272
00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:19.090
格裡戈裡•索維奇•卡爾波夫上校
Colonel Grigori Borisovich Karpov,


273
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:21.800
1986年駐紮於車臣
stationed in Chechnya, 1986.


274
00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.400
他參與了集團犯罪
He was involved with organized crime.


275
00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:28.240
重大犯罪 武器換毒品 販賣白人妓女
Big time. Drugs for arms. White slave traffic.


276
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:30.650
沒他沒幹過的壞事
You name it he was in to it.

286
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.530
"北方避難所"是什麼組織
What exactly is Sanctuary North?


287
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.890
我是個律師
I'm a lawyer.


288
00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.890
我們的客戶都是離開了出生地的人

實際上失去了國籍的人

290
00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.400
他們經常受過創傷

291
00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.570
你是什麼目的 裡克特小姐
What is it you want, Miss Richter?


292
00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.120
要我捐款？
A donation?


293
00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.570
對不起
I'm sorry.


294
00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.920
那些話沒打動我
That was insensitive.


295
00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.800
我是為了一個客戶而來
I'm here on behalf of a client.


296
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.520
他叫伊薩•卡爾波夫
His name is Issa Karpov.


297
00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.810
你知道這個名字嗎
Is the name known to you?


298
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:46.130
卡爾波夫？
Karpov?


299
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.680
不知道
Mmm-mmm. No.


300
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.170
他有一封你父親寫給他的信
He is in possession of a letter written by your father to his.


301
00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.650
信中提到"利比紮馬"
It makes reference to a Mr. Lipizzaner,


302
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.250
就是那種生下來是黑色 然後逐漸變成白色的西班牙馬
as in the Spanish horses which are born black but gradually turn white.


303
00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:00.650
對
Yes.


304
00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:03.920
你的銀行對這種業務應該很熟悉吧
This is a process I'm guessing your bank is familiar with?


305
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.920
信中有一個數字
The letter contains a number.


306
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.130
符合嗎

307
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.610
符合什麼
Does it fit what?


308
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.490
這數字是這銀行中的一個賬戶嗎
Is the number an account reference in use at this bank?


309
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:29.160
我的銀行並不大肆宣傳我們的業務方式
I'm afraid my bank doesn't broadcast the manner in which it does its business.


310
00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.280
這肯定很適合你的客戶們
I'm sure that suits your clients very well.


311
00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:37.890
但假如這個數字的確屬￿本銀行的一個賬戶
But if this number does pertain to an account held at this bank,


312
00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:41.720
也是很久以前開設的賬戶了
it would have been established quite some time ago.


313
00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:46.970
我需要查一下記錄
I will need to check our records.


314
00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.970
我查完後會聯繫你的
Once I have done so I will call you.


315
00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.210
什麼時候
When?


316
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.490
我的客戶在漢堡的處境非常敏感 布魯先生
My client's situation in Hamburg is extremely sensitive Mr. Brue.


317
00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.280
我相信
I'm sure.


318
00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.840
他信任你
He trusts you.


319
00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:04.010
從信的內容看 他父親也曾很信任你的父親
As, judging by the contents of the letter, his father trusted yours.


320
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.200

324
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.450
對不起
Sorry.


325
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.800
沒關係 我已經戒煙了
That's all right. I've given up.


326
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.800
是嗎 只怕很難
Yeah? Good luck with that.


327
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:26.680
喂
Yes?


328
00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:30.280
好
Okay.


329
00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.170
"大西洋"

330
00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.280

332

要喝什麼

333
00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.730
一杯紅酒？
Uh, glass of wine?


334
00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.970
純水
Uh, still water please.


335
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.320
純水 好的
Still water. Of course.


336
00:30:57.340 --> 00:30:59.880
你常來"大西洋"嗎
You frequent the Atlantic?


337
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.810
呃…
Uh...


338
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.970
不常來？
Not your scene?


339
00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:10.160
你說過你的客戶處境很敏感 所以很急
You said your client's situation was sensitive, hence the hurry.


340
00:31:11.780 --> 00:31:15.890
我可以確認 你提供的參考數宇
I can confirm that the reference number you supplied


341
00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:19.840
的確是屬￿"布魯兄弟銀行"的一個賬戶
does pertain to an account held at Brue Freres Bank.


342
00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.040
那麼他想繼承這筆錢
Then he intends to make a claim.


343
00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.770
那麼讓他帶個大皮箱
Then tell him to bring a large suitcase.


344
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:30.760
當然他需要證明白己的身份
Of course he will need to establish his identity.


345
00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.930
我的客戶是在困難的情況下進入這個國家
My client entered the country in difficult circumstances.


346
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.210
那封信在他手上

347
00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.890
-我需要看看  -當然

348
00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.970
另外他還需要提供一個器具

349
00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:44.050
什麼器具

350
00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.130
恐怕我不能說
I'm afraid I can't say,


351
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.530
但假如你的客戶是合法繼承人
but if your client is legitimate


352
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.290
他會知道我說的是什麼
he will know what I am talking about.


353
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.040
如果他有這器具呢
And if he has this instrument?


354
00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:58.600
那就沒什麼障礙了
I see no difficulty in proceeding.


355
00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:15.080
她要出來了

357
00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:27.770
不是我喜歡的類型
Not my type.


358
00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.610
你喜歡什麼樣的 昆特
What is your type, Günther?


359
00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:33.200
你這樣的 伊娜 你是知道的

去約翰內斯•勃拉姆斯廣場
Johannes-Brahms-Platz.


361

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.760
我叫巴克曼

364
00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.280
領導一個反恐小組
I head an anti-terror unit


365
00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:33.480
知道我們的人不多 喜歡我們的更少
not many people know about and even less like.


366
00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.090
我們走走
Let's walk.


367
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.850
漢堡是世上最偉大的港口之一 湯姆
Hamburg is one of the great ports of the world, Tommy.


368
00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.330
數百年來 它張開雙臂
For centuries it opened its arms


369
00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:24.040
歡迎被沖上海岸的每一個外國人

370
00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.210
而如今在911之後
Now, since 9/11,


371
00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.450
每個深色皮膚的人
in the eyes of every dark-skinned man


372
00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.050
我們都感覺這些人可能會殺害我們
we see someone who wants to kill us.


373
00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.280
而且 確實有此可能
Problem is some of them do,


374
00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:38.810
問題是 伊薩•卡爾波夫是不是這樣的人
but the question is whether Issa Karpov is one of them.


375
00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.520
那個律師
The lawyer.


376
00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.810
律師？
Lawyer?

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.890
安娜貝爾•裡克特

378
00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.410
你在酒店見過的律師  想和她上床的那個律師
The one you met at the hotel. The one you'd like to fuck.


379
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:52.850
怎麼 難道不是嗎
What? Not true?


380
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.450
你對她來說太老了 你我都太老了
You're too old for her, Tommy. We both are.


381
00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.330
見到她 愛上她 但你永遠得不到她
See her, love her, but you'll never get her,


382
00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:00.210
即使有那一筆
not even with all that black money


383
00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.490
藏在你銀行金庫的黑錢
you've got tucked away in your bank vaults.


384
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:06.250
我只知道裡克特小姐代表的客戶
As far as I am aware, Miss Richter represents


385
00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:11.490
在我的銀行裡有合法的金融業務

386
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:14.450
你的銀行與俄國人做生意吧
Your bank does business with the Russians, right?


387

以前是的 在我父親的時代

388
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.600
黑手黨？
Mafia?


389
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.800
主要是軍方的
Military mainly.


390
00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.090
我完全可以
What's to stop me


391
00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.640
對此置身事外
from just walking away from this?


392
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.610
不管是什麼渾水
Whatever this is.


393
00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:36.400
要不要先全面審計一下你的帳目？
How about we start with a full audit of your books?


394
00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.290
你父親並非只是個銀行家 湯姆
But your father wasn't just a banker, Tommy.


395
00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:43.730
還從事洗錢
He was a laundryman.


396
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:44.770
你是在威脅我？
You're threatening me?


397
00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.480
只是同情你
Just sympathizing.


398
00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.640
留給你收拾殘局
You've been left to clean up the mess.


399

我們有工作要做 湯姆

你要協助我們
You're going to help me do it.

到底做什麼
Do what exactly?


402
00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.690
先從挽救安娜貝爾•裡克特開始

403
00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.530
為了什麼

404
00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.320
為所有的事情
From all of it.


405
00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.770
沒想到你會來
Hmm. I wasn't expecting you.


406
00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.090
是嗎
No?


407
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.520
你以為誰會來
Who were you expecting?


408
00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.240
今天不順心？
Bad day?


409
00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.730
發生了一些意外
A few surprises.

享用你的威士忌 湯姆

412
00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:11.640

Of course.


416
00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:22.680
伊薩
Issa.


417
00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.160
這位是布魯先生
This is Mr. Brue.


418
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.440
早上好
Morning.


419
00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.480
你可以讓他看看信
Perhaps you could show him the letter.


420
00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.760
親愛的卡爾波夫：
"My dear Karpov,


421
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.690
正如我們討論過的 請接收這封信
"as discussed, please accept this letter


422
00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.890
做為一個朋友對另一個朋友的擔保
"as assurance from one friend to another,


423
00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.010
假如你不幸去世
"that in the unfortunate circumstance of your death


424
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:52.730
我會很高興把你的兒子
"I should be pleased to acquaint your own dear son,


425
00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.650
伊萬•格裡維奇•卡爾波夫
"Ivan Grigorevich Karpov,


426
00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:58.200
介紹給我們的朋友"利比紮馬"
"with our friend Mr. Lipizzaner.


427
00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.090
他只需要持有這封信
"He need only present this letter,


428
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.130
再帶上你的器具
"together with the necessary instrument


429
00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.480
就可以了
"currently in your possession for me to act.


430
00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:09.090
假如我去世了
"In case of my own death,


431
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.760
我兒子湯姆將履行我對你的承諾
"my son Thomas will fulfill my promise to you."


432
00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:18.210
對不起 這是你父親的親筆簽名嗎
Forgive me. It's correct signature of your father?


433
00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.880
是的
It is.


434
00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:24.330
那我該稱呼你伊薩 還是伊萬
Should I address you then as Issa or Ivan?


435
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.650
伊薩
Issa.


436
00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.810
這是我的穆斯林名字 也是我喜歡的
It's my Muslim name and I like.


437
00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.840
但這不是你父親給你取的名字？
But not the one your father gave you?


438
00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:34.360
我母親是車臣人
My mother was Chechen.


439
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:36.410
我希望在你的幫助下
I wish, sir, with your help,


440
00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:39.330
能在漢堡體面的生活
to make an honorable life in Hamburg.


441
00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.130
很好
Very good,


442
00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:45.880
但首先 你明白需要有些證明
but first, you understand there are certain questions of fact.


443
00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.680
我想問問那個物件
I bring your attention to the matter of the instrument.


444
00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:01.560
我能不能問問 你是怎麼得到的？
May I ask how you came to be in possession of this?


445
00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.440
是我父親的律師給我的
It was given to me by my father's lawyer.


446
00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:09.050
那麼說來 是要求我
So it seems I am being asked


447
00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:12.650
履行一個父親對另一個父親的承諾
to fulfill one father's promise to another.


448
00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.520
是的 卡爾波夫是我父親
It's true. Karpov was my father.


449
00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:18.320
你們並不親近？
You weren't close?


450
00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.120
我父親殺過人
My father was a murderer.


451
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.210
他手上沾有車臣人的鮮血
He has Chechen blood on his hands.


452
00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:26.690
而你似乎願意接受他的錢？
And yet you seem willing enough to take his money?


453
00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.770
我聽說你是從土耳其來到這兒的
I understand you came here from Turkey,


454
00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:40.610
是通過非正式的途徑 可以這麼說嗎
by an informal route, shall we say?


455
00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:45.160
我能不能問問 你在土耳其是做什麼的
May I ask, what you were doing in Turkey?


456
00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:47.930
我是在牢裡
I was in prison.


457
00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:50.610
坐牢之前呢
And before that?


458
00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:55.080
在俄國的牢裡
I was in prison in Russia.


459
00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:58.810
-為什麼坐牢  -你不必回答這個問題 伊薩
- Why? - You don't need to answer that, Issa.


460
00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.210
為什麼
Why not?


461
00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.570
因為這與此無關的
Because it is immaterial.


462
00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.080
和什麼無關 裡克特小姐
To what, Fraulein Richter?


463
00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.250
你的客戶…
Your client...


464
00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.440
他也是你的客戶 布魯先生
He's your client, too, Mr. Brue.


465
00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.930
你的客戶要求繼承
Your client lays claim


466
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.610
他父親的賬戶
to his father's account,


467
00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.010
可他沒有護照
yet he has no passport,


468
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.770
證明不了自己的身份
cannot prove his identity.


469
00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:19.120
他有鑰匙 也有信 你還想要什麼
He has the key and the letter, what more do you want?


470
00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:46.720
我們聽得不是很清楚 湯姆
We couldn't hear everything so well, Tommy.


471
00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:50.570
賬戶裡有多少錢
So exactly how much are we talking about?


472
00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.650
我不能告訴你
I can't tell you.


473
00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.240
不能說具數額
Not exactly.


474
00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.160
大致數額呢
A ballpark figure?


475
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.450
1萬？ 10萬？ 50萬？

476
00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.000
數額
We're talking


477
00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:07.680
在一千萬歐元以上
upwards of 10 million euro.


478
00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.000
至少
At least.


479
00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.890
-咖啡  -好
- Coffee. - Yes, sir.


480
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:22.680
-黑咖啡  -馬上就好
- Black. - Right away.


481
00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:25.930
我本不確定你會來
I wasn't sure you'd come.


482
00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.200
我想說明一點
I want to make one thing clear.


483
00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.680
我不欠你任何人情
I don't owe you anything.


484
00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.320
在貝魯特出了什麼事
What happened in Beirut?


485
00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.250
你知道在貝魯特出了什麼事
You know what happened in Beirut.


486
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.640
我的聯絡網被毀了
My networks were blown.


487
00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.880
那麼調到漢堡是處罰你？
So Hamburg is a punishment?


488
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.720
這要看你是否喜歡漢堡了
Depends on whether you like Hamburg.


489
00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:51.280
或者這是你們的計策
Unless that's what you want people to think?


490
00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.410
轉移別人對你的注意力
Take some of the heat off you so you can


491
00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:54.890
你卻暗中進行調查
get on with the real game.


492
00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.330
調查什麼
Which is?


493
00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.600
費薩爾•阿布杜拉博士
Dr. Faisal Abdullah.


494
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.880
拜託 昆特 我們對他的瞭解 可能和你差不多
Come on, Günther, we probably know as much about him as you do.


495
00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.760
你瞭解什麼 馬莎
What do you know, Martha?


496
00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.530
我們知道你監視他幾個月了
We know you've been watching him for months,


497
00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:20.770
也知道你受到壓力 需要儘快得出結果
and we know you're under pressure to get results.


498
00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.410
我們知道他通過一個
And we know that the man moves money


499
00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.730
穆斯林慈善機構來轉移資金
through a network of Muslim charities


500
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:28.240
每一次轉移 都會有一部分錢失蹤
and every time he does, some of it goes missing.


501
00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:34.330
費薩爾•阿布杜拉博士正是那種
Dr. Faisal Abdullah is everything


502
00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.930
我們最喜歡的穆斯林 而且他做的更好
we want him to be and a little bit more.


503
00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.640
他寬容、開明 與西方國家交流
He's tolerant, enlightened, engaged with the West.


504
00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.960
可每個好人身上 也都有不好的一面 不是嗎
But every good man has a little bit of bad, doesn't he?


505
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.850
在阿布杜拉身上
And in Abdullah's case,


506
00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.400
這不好的一面
that little bit


507
00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.480
或許就是殺心
just might kill you.


508
00:43:55.780 --> 00:44:00.090
既然你們知道這麼多 他為什麼依然在漢堡自由自在
You know all that, how come he's still walking the streets of Hamburg


509
00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:03.090
而不是被關在關塔那摩監獄裡？
and not rotting in some cell in Guantanamo?


510
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:06.730
因為我們只是懷疑但沒有證據
Because we think, we don't know.


511
00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.810
失蹤的錢 我們不知道去了哪裡
The money leaves and we don't know where it goes.


512
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.970
況且在德國領土上 他還受到德國法律的保護
Anyways, on German soil he's got the protection of German law.


513
00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:16.450
你們可從來不管德國法律
That hasn't stopped you before.


514
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:18.330
我們不再這麼做了
We don't do that anymore.


515
00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:20.250
那麼是要求我們這麼做了
You want us to do it, then.


516
00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.870
我不明白的是 你為何到現在也沒這麼做
I'm more interested in knowing why you haven't done it already?


517
00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:27.600
請在這件事上與我們合作吧 昆特
Please work with us on this one, Günther.


518
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.970
我信不過你們
I don't trust you.


519
00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:35.480
老習慣難改啊
Old habits die hard.


520
00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:38.480
所以信不過你們
That's what I'm worried about.


521
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.320
我說的是你
I was talking about yours.


522
00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:45.970
再見
Have a nice day.


523
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.520
我收到了你的短信
I got your text.


524
00:45:13.940 --> 00:45:15.480
我…
I...


525
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.360
這事我不能幹下去了
I can't do this anymore.


526
00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:23.330
會被人發現的 我能感覺到
Someone's going to find out. I can feel it.


527
00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.480
我很害怕
I'm frightened.


528
00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:34.930
他們盯上了我
They are looking at me.


529
00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.880
他們都是
All of them.


530
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:39.680
我不幹了到此為止
I'm done. It's over.


531
00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:43.560
我不是你的間諜 我是學生
I am not your spy. I am a student.


532
00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.810
你無法逼我幹這個
You cannot make me do this.


533
00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:48.840
我從未逼你幹過任何事 賈馬爾
I never made you do anything, Jamal.


534
00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.280
也永遠不會
And I never will.


535
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:56.530
你是知道的
You know that.


536
00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.240
我們第一次見面時
When we first met,


537
00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.480
還記得我們說過什麼嗎
you remember what we talked about?


538
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:08.240
你記得嗎
You remember that?


539
00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:12.160
家人  未來
Family, the future.


540
00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:17.240
大多數人對此沒有選擇的權利 可是你有
Most of us don't get to choose, but you did.


541
00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.760
你做出了正確的選擇
You made the right choice.


542
00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:23.840
這條路並不容易
It's not easy.


543
00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.560
但沒有回頭路
But there's no going back,


544
00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:32.410
對我們來說都是
for any of us.


545
00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:37.320
我們無法改變做過的事
We can't undo what's done.


546
00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.810
看著我
Look at me.


547
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:51.730
看著我
Look at me.


548
00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.570
來
Come here.


549
00:46:58.620 --> 00:47:02.280
你是我的耳目 賈馬爾 我需要你
You're my ears, Jamal, and my eyes. I need you.


550
00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.200
你對我很重要
You're important to me.


551
00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:12.960
好嗎？
Good.


552
00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.360
-喂  -湯姆
- Hello? - Tommy?


553
00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.640
是我
Yes.


554
00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:54.130
你需要滿足伊薩•卡爾波夫的要求
You need to give Issa Karpov what he wants.


555
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:15.880
呃 裡克特小姐？
Uh, Miss Richter?


556
00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.730
我們能談談嗎
Can we talk?


557
00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:24.890
或許我們一起喝杯茶？
Perhaps we could go for a tea?


558
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.840
你想怎樣
What do you want?


559
00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:31.370
我重新考慮了你的客戶的情況
I've reconsidered your client's position.


560
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.800
我的銀行打算滿足他的要求
My bank is prepared to honor his claim.


561
00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.840
你為何改變主意了
Why have you changed your mind?


562
00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.960
或許是你說服了我
Perhaps you convinced me.


563
00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.650
我以為你會高興的
I thought you'd be pleased.


564
00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.240
好吧
Okay.


565
00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.680
我會聯繫你的
I'll be in touch.


566
00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.480
安娜貝爾
Annabel?


567
00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.640
我們應該小心
We should take care.


568
00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:06.880
我們所有人
All of us.


569
00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.170
奉獻是我們的宗教義務
It is our religious obligation to give.


570
00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.130
這是神聖的宗教稅
This is the holy practice of Zakat,


571
00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.360
是伊斯蘭教五大支柱之一
one of the five pillars of Islam.


572
00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:48.010
通過我們對這一慈善行為的堅持
Through our adherence to this practice of charity,


573
00:50:48.020 --> 00:50:50.050
我們會更離上帝更近
we are drawn nearer to God.


574
00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.280
昆特 那銀行家打來電話 他辦妥了
Günther, the banker called. He did it.


575
00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:54.120
很好
Good.


576
00:50:56.660 --> 00:50:58.520
伊薩 伊薩
Issa! Issa!


577
00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.010
醒醒
Wake up.


578
00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.530
你要帶他去哪兒
Where will you take him?


579
00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:08.400
你還是不知道的好
It's better if you don't know.


580
00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:10.290
我們必須走
We have to go.


581
00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:14.040
你住在這裡不安全 不管是對你還是對他們
It's not safe to stay here. For you or for them.


582
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:16.050
這裡面有衣服
There are clothes in here.


583
00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.560
也有一把剪刀和剃鬚刀
There's also some scissors and a razor.


584
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.400
伊薩 他們知道你的模樣
Issa, they know what you look like.


585
00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:29.080
快 伊薩
Come on, Issa.


586
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:22.870
願真主保佑這房子

587
00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:41.040
他們動身了
They're moving.


588
00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.240
我們要去哪兒
Where are we going?


589
00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:53.730
我哥哥弗洛林有個公寓正在裝修
My brother Florien has an apartment that's being renovated.


590
00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:57.000
他已安排他們停工一周
He's arranged for them to stop work for a week.


591
00:54:11.180 --> 00:54:13.680
下一站是哪兒
Where's the next station?


592
00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.280
好
Okay.


593
00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.240
我們下一站下車
We get out at the next stop.


594
00:54:28.540 --> 00:54:31.560
我們要再找一輛出租車
We have to find another taxi, okay?


595
00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:00.610
喂
Hey.


596
00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.920
你擋住路了
You're blocking the street!


597
00:55:05.940 --> 00:55:07.560
喂
Hey.


598
00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.480
該死
Oh, fuck!


599
00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:06.960
誰啊
Hello?


600
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:10.680
誰啊
Hello?


601
00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:15.490
靠在牆上
Against the wall!


602
00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:17.010
搜查別的房間
Check the other rooms!


603
00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:18.090
住手
Ow! Stop!


604
00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:19.650
臥室沒人
Bedroom clear.


605
00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.760
我們快到了
We're nearly there.


606
00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:27.200
我想和布魯先生談談
I wish to talk to Mr. Brue.


607
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:30.160
我今晚早些時候和他談過
I spoke with him earlier tonight.


608
00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:34.170
伊薩 他說銀行會滿足你的要求
Issa, he says the bank will honor your claim.


609
00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.640
我不想要那筆錢
I do not want the money.


610
00:57:37.820 --> 00:57:39.410
什麼
What?


611
00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:42.760
父親的錢是不乾淨的錢
Father's money is bad money.


612
00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.120
可你除了這錢一無所有
But without it you have nothing.


613
00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.200
我有上帝
I have God.


614
00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:57.120
我給你帶了些吃的
I brought you some food.


615
00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:08.650
裡面有個睡袋和幾件衣服
There's a sleeping bag and some more clothes.


616
00:58:10.220 --> 00:58:12.600
我明天一早就回來
I'll be back first thing in the morning.


617
00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:18.960
這裡不是監獄
It is not a prison.


618
00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:36.170
這就是你最高檔的場所？
This was the best you could do, huh?


619
00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:38.760
我是個穴居人
I am a cave dweller.


620
00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:42.120
我會留給你一個有景觀的房間
I'll leave the rooms with a view to you.


621
00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:46.480
你批准穆爾行動了？
You let Mohr off the leash?


622
00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:51.960
他想激怒你的話 不需要我的批准
He doesn't need me to give him a reason to piss you off.


623
00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.840
你跟丟了卡爾波夫 是不是
You've lost Karpov, haven't you?


624
00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:03.720
我需要讓那個律師行動自由
I need the lawyer to move freely.


625
00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:09.250
我可沒那麼大的影響力 昆特
I don't have that kind of influence, Günther.


626
00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:12.930
你我都知道 你的影響力要多大就有多大
We both know you have all the influence you choose to have.


627
00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.170
假如你要我繼續幫你 你就必須告訴我
Look, if you want me to help you on your way, you've got to tell me.


628
00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:18.330
告訴我 你下一步的方向
Tell me which way you're heading.


629
00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:25.720
上個月 一艘貨輪離開了塞浦路斯
Last month a cargo ship left Cyprus.


630
00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:31.410
裝載了一千噸捐贈糧食駛往吉布提
It was carrying 1,000 tons of donated grain bound for Djibouti.


631
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:36.410
在也門南海岸停船加油
It stopped to re-fuel on the south coast of Yemen.


632
00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:41.760
到達目的地後還剩下900噸
When it reached its destination there were 900 tons left.


633
00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:45.000
在同一時間 有100噸糧食
At the same time 100 tons of grain


634
00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.920
神秘的出現在也門的利伯維爾場
mysteriously hit the open market in the Yemen.


635
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:53.730
掙來的錢給了伊斯蘭激進分子
The money from its sale was used to buy rocket launchers


636
00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:56.000
購買火箭發射器
for Islamist militants.


637
00:59:56.220 --> 01:00:00.880
我認為這家船運公司是基地組織的一個幌子
I think the shipping company is an al-Qaeda front.


638
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.210
我認為阿布杜拉的慈善機構
I think that's where the missing funds


639
01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.560
失蹤的資金就是去了那裡
from Abdullah's charities are going.


640
01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.720
你是認為還是確定？
You think, or you know?


641
01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.250
拜託 昆特 分享一下
Come on, Günther. Share.


642
01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.880
阿布杜拉不是壞人
Abdullah's not the bad guy.


643
01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:19.040
他是我們找到壞人的方式
He's our way to the bad guy.


644
01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.770
他提供資金 購買武器來殺害美國人
A man supplies money that buys weapons that kills Americans


645
01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:24.170
你卻說他是好人
and you're telling me he's a pal?


646
01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:27.370
雖然他不像你們那樣賣力的
So maybe he's not waving the flag of freedom and democracy


647
01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:28.930
揮舞自由民主的大旗
as enthusiastically as you'd like.


648
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:30.410
好了
Okay.


649
01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.930
不用教訓我們了
- But he sees his people... - Spare the lecture.


650
01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.730
他看到他的同族人一直受到不公平對待
He sees his people being fucked over from here to eternity.


651
01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.850
這些話我都聽過了…
I've heard that before, so...


652
01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:40.930
也許他有了一點報復的想法
Maybe a little bit of him wants to return the favor,


653
01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:44.650
但也正是這一點讓他這麼有價值
but it's that little bit that makes him so valuable.


654
01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:46.160
你說不是嗎
Don't you see?


655
01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:49.850
我明白你的意思 可我們美國人不會這麼說
Okay. I understand. But that's not what my people would say.


656
01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:53.050
你們美國人會怎麼說 除掉他 殺了他？
What would your people say? Take him out? Kill him?


657
01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:54.690
然後你們會得到什麼呢
And then what have you got?


658
01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:58.210
挖了個大坑 誰來填平呢
A great big fucking hole, and who's going to fill it?


659
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.000
沒人知道 尤其是你
Nobody knows. You least of all.


660
01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:05.130
於是我們又開始查找
So we all start looking again,


661
01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.400
在夜裡到處敲門
and tap-tapping around in the dark.


662
01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:15.010
你想獨自調查阿布杜拉 對嗎
You want to own Abdullah, is that what you want?


663
01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:18.520
以你的名聲和你這點人馬
A man with your reputation and your resources.


664
01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.840
你怎麼能做到
How are you going to do that?


665
01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:26.130
卡爾波夫的這筆錢
Karpov has access to money.


666
01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.970
這或許會引起阿布杜拉的興趣
That may be of interest to Abdullah.


667
01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.690
那律師呢
And the lawyer?


668
01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.290
他信任她
He trusts her.


669
01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:43.930
沒事的
It's okay.


670
01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.520
沒事？
It's okay?


671
01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:55.560
輕鬆
Dance.


672
01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:00.490
-你是想在我面前逞英雄？  -不是
- Trying to impress me, Günther? - No.


673
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.450
聽著 我會再次約束穆爾
Listen, I'll put Mohr back on the leash,


674
01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.680
但現在你欠我的人情了
but now you owe me.


675
01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:05.610
嗨 安娜貝爾
Hey, Annabel.


676
01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.400
很高興見到你 厄休拉還好嗎
Good to see you. How's Ursula?


677
01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:10.810
不
No, no.


678
01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:16.640
放開我
Let go. Let go of me!


679
01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.000
喂
Yes?


680
01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:10.090
好了嗎
Okay?


681
01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.280
好了
- Yeah. Good. - Yeah.


682
01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.880
拉希德
- Rasheed? - Mmm-hmm?


683
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:22.810
你不能這麼做 我是個律師
You can't do this. I'm a lawyer.


684
01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:23.930
這是犯罪行為
This is criminal.


685
01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:25.960
給我坐下
Sit the fuck down.


686
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:28.200
律師？
Lawyer?


687
01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:31.360
你是恐怖分子的社會工作者
You're a fucking social worker for terrorists.


688
01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:34.180
抽煙嗎
Cigarette?


689
01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:38.000
對 你戒煙了
That's right, you've given up.


690
01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.400
這就完了？
Is that it?


691
01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:50.200
你就反抗這麼一兩下？
Is that all the fight you're going to give me?


692
01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.850
和平主義者
Pacifist.


693
01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.160
我們瞭解你
We know about you.


694
01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.410
左翼律師
Left-wing lawyer.


695
01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:08.370
家庭富裕
Wealthy family.


696
01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:10.530
父親是法官
Father's a judge.


697
01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.040
你做的每一件事都是對他無聲的反抗
Everything you do says "fuck you" to him.


698
01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:23.720
你就這麼點能耐？
Is that the best you can do?


699
01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:26.480
我可以走了嗎
Can I go now?


700
01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.280
去哪兒
Go where?


701
01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:35.120
去哪兒
Go where?


702
01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.520
回到你在"北方避難所"那些自以為是的朋友們那裡？
Back to your self-righteous friends at Sanctuary North?


703
01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:52.320
可沒人會鋸掉他們的頭 不是嗎
But no one's going to saw off their heads, are they?


704
01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:57.250
沒人會炸死他們的孩子
Nobody's going to blow up their kids


705
01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.290
因為你在巴利島的海灘上
because you're on a beach in Bali


706
01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:02.920
或是乘火車去在馬德裡或倫敦的學校
or riding a train to school in Madrid or London.


707
01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.010
你怎麼敢這麼說
How fucking dare you?


708
01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.370
How fucking dare me?

709
01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:10.280
告訴我違反了所有法律
Tell me I've broken every rule in the book?


710
01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:14.960
我踐踏了憲法的宗旨？
That I've trampled on the essence of the constitution?


711
01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.600
你想說這套廢話嗎
You want to spout that crap?


712
01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:25.120
是嗎
Yes?


713
01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:29.000
你知道身在哪兒嗎
Do you know where you are?


714
01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:31.850
你不知道
No, you don't.


715
01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:34.680
這就是殘酷的現實世界 安娜貝爾
This is the real world, Annabel.


716
01:06:36.740 --> 01:06:41.480
我們是在和一個叫伊斯蘭的國家中的激進分子作戰
We are fighting against the radical off cuts of a nation called Islam.


717
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.610
你已經越過了界
You've crossed the line.


718
01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:46.120
你如今是站在他們一邊了
You're on their side now.


719
01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:30.850
你好
Hello.


720
01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:44.050
我不在乎你們打算怎麼對待我
I don't care what you do to me.


721
01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:47.720
可關鍵不在於你 不是嗎
But you're not the one we're talking about, are you, dear?


722
01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.040
伊薩 現在肯定很擔心
Issa must be worried sick.


723
01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:56.400
不管你把他藏在哪裡
Wherever you've hidden him,


724
01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:00.720
他恐怕在想你再也不會回去了
he's probably wondering if you're ever coming back.


725
01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:09.760
但願他不會做出傻事來
I hope he doesn't do anything foolish.


726
01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.850
來和我一起坐坐
Come, sit with me.


727
01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.560
來
Come on.


728
01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:22.050
現在有人想逮捕他
There are people out there who want to arrest him.


729
01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:24.450
當然你知道這事
You know that of course.


730
01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:28.320
我們擔心他們會在我們之前找到他
We're concerned that they will find him before we do.


731
01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:32.000
他們和我們的做事方式可大不一樣
There is a difference between them and us.


732
01:08:33.740 --> 01:08:36.120
他們想傷害他
They want to hurt him.


733
01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:39.720
我們想幫助他
We want to help him.


734
01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.570
安娜貝爾 我們不是你的敵人
You see, Annabel, we're not your enemy.


735
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.840
而是你的出路
We're your solution.


736
01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:10.600
很好
Good.


737
01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:55.240
你知道我的人怎麼對我說的嗎
You know what my guys told me?


738
01:09:55.260 --> 01:09:58.280
當他們從街上抓走你的時候
When they pulled you off the street?


739
01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:01.200
你沒有做出反抗
You didn't put up a fight.


740
01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:03.800
沒像樣的反抗
Not really.


741
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.610
只是稍稍掙扎了一下
You struggled a bit.


742
01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:07.880
喊了一下
Screamed a little, but


743
01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:10.760
就任由他們抓走你
you let them take you.


744
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:19.920
似乎是你希望此事發生
It's almost as if you wanted it to happen.


745
01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:25.850
你需要有人接管此事
You needed someone to take it out of your hands


746
01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:29.280
因為你已經力所不及了 安娜貝爾
because you are out of your depth, Annabel.


747
01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.250
你知道你救不了他
You know you can't save him,


748
01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:37.920
至少靠你自己不行
not on your own.


749
01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:45.880
你要麼求助我們
Your choice is between us


750
01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.680
要麼找不到任何人
and nobody.


751
01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:53.880
時間已不多了
The clock is ticking.


752
01:10:56.700 --> 01:11:00.200
你知道他們會找到他 到時
You know they'll find him, and when they do,


753
01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:04.570
會立刻讓他坐飛機回俄國
he'll be on the first plane back to Russia,


754
01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:07.280
除非美國人想得到他
unless the Americans want him


755
01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.160
然後我們就不知道把他關在哪兒了 他也不會知道
and then we won't know where he is and nor will he.


756
01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.720
他不想要那筆錢
He doesn't want the money.


757
01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.440
就是不想要
He just doesn't want it.


758
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.290
一半是激進分子 一半是
Half radical, half


759
01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:26.650
有錢的年輕人
rich kid.


760
01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:29.760
一半俄國人 一半車臣人
Half Russian, half Chechen.


761
01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:33.600
愛他母親 恨他父親
Loves his mother, hates his father.


762
01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:38.200
你我都清楚 伊薩•卡爾波夫並不知道自己想要什麼
You and I both know Issa Karpov has no idea what he wants.


763
01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:41.810
還有一點
There is something else


764
01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:44.600
是你我都知道的 是不是
you and I both know, don't we?


765
01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:50.600
我們都知道他是無辜的
We both know he's innocent.


766
01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.120
那麼你想幹什麼
So what do you want?


767
01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:15.520
我想幫他
I want to help him.


768
01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:43.680
伊薩
Issa?


769
01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:56.370
伊薩 對不起
Issa, I'm sorry.


770
01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.370
我做了個夢
I had a dream.


771
01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.920
他們抓走了你 拷打你
They took you. They tortured you.


772
01:14:11.740 --> 01:14:13.570
然後呢
And what happened?


773
01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:18.640
我告訴他們你在哪兒了嗎
Did I tell them where you were?


774
01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:20.170
沒有
No.


775
01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:22.210
你比我堅強
You are stronger than I was.


776
01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:24.600
你什麼都沒跟他們說
You tell them nothing.


777
01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:28.770
去穿些暖和的衣服
Go and put on something warm.


778
01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.280
我想帶你出去看看
I want to show you something outside.


779
01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.040
好
Okay.


780
01:16:30.180 --> 01:16:31.840
好
Right.


781
01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.930
看看他
Look at him.


782
01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:40.120
他很安全
He's safe.


783
01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:44.370
這裡還有你的床
There's a bed for you here.


784
01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:46.490
你最好別回家
It's better that you don't go home.


785
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:49.120
穆爾先生和他的人還在找你
Herr Mohr and his boys are still out looking for you.


786
01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.770
你是想灌醉我嗎
Are you trying to get me drunk?


787
01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:57.400
是的
Yes.


788
01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:00.440
卡爾波夫怎麼樣了
How's Karpov?


789
01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.520
快了
Getting there.


790
01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.080
那律師呢
And the lawyer?


791
01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.880
我已經幫你儘量爭取了時間
I already got you all the time I can get.


792
01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.760
貝魯特的事兒是我們的錯
Beirut was our mistake.


793
01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:22.280
我們的一個特工
One of our agents


794
01:17:22.940 --> 01:17:26.880
毀了你的網絡 你分享了情報 是我們辦砸了
blew your network and I know you shared. We messed up.


795
01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:31.560
只想告訴你這一點
Just thought you needed to know that.


796
01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:35.360
我們經常犯類似錯誤
We make that kind of mistake.


797
01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:41.130
我能理解你為什麼信不過我們
I can understand why you don't trust us.


798
01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:44.640
你的特工和聯絡人暴露了
Your agents and contacts were compromised.


799
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.810
一些信任你的人死了
Men who trusted you died,


800
01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:52.640
這會讓你永遠不能忘懷
and that stays with you always.


801
01:17:54.500 --> 01:17:56.680
我們留下的
And all that damage


802
01:17:57.700 --> 01:17:59.800
那些傷害
we leave behind.


803
01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:09.370
那些生命
All those lives,


804
01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.560
那些空蕩蕩的房子
all those empty rooms,


805
01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:16.960
他們本來的命運是什麼
what would they have been for?


806
01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:21.280
你問過自己這個問題嗎
You ever ask yourself that question?


807
01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:24.850
我們為何幹這行
Why we do what we do?


808
01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:27.850
有時也會問
Mmm-hmm, sometimes.


809
01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:29.970
可每次都是同樣的答案
But I always come back to the same answer.


810
01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:32.000
是什麼
And what is it?


811
01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.760
為了讓世界更安全
Make the world a safer place.


812
01:18:37.860 --> 01:18:39.520
這還不夠嗎
Isn't that enough?


813
01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:11.600
動一下你的皇后
Move your queen.


814
01:19:13.740 --> 01:19:15.210
雖然你是俄國人
Just because you're Russian,


815
01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:19.040
不等於你下棋比我強
doesn't mean you're a better chess player than me.


816
01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:22.090
我是車臣人
I'm Chechen.


817
01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:26.520
好吧 你下棋厲害
Okay, so you're good at chess.


818
01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:30.400
說說你別的方面
Tell me something else about yourself.


819
01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:36.240
你說過你母親是車臣人？
You said your mother is Chechen?


820
01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.400
她去世了
She's dead.


821
01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:42.680
對不起
I'm sorry.


822
01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:46.720
我父親強姦了她
My father raped her.


823
01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.410
她死於我出生那一天
She died when I was born.


824
01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:56.880
當時她15歲
She was 15.


825
01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:08.170
這是我媽媽的
It was my mother's.


826
01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.690
很漂亮
It's beautiful.


827
01:21:12.340 --> 01:21:14.280
你必須走
You must go.


828
01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:43.240
你可以再刺激一下他
You can push him a bit more.


829
01:21:44.260 --> 01:21:46.760
讓他動情緒
Try to get him emotional.


830
01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:51.400
只要是自然而然的 你不妨發發脾氣
If it happens naturally, lose your temper.


831
01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:58.730
可他不想要那筆錢
But he doesn't want the money.


832
01:21:58.740 --> 01:22:00.400
我知道
I know.


833
01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:04.080
可他喜歡你
But he wants you.


834
01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.090
昆特
Günther?


835
01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:32.810
你應該當心點
You should take care.


836
01:22:32.820 --> 01:22:35.520
也許我們太心急了
Maybe we're pushing too hard.


837
01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:39.080
你可別軟弱 伊娜
Don't go soft on me, Irna.


838
01:22:39.100 --> 01:22:41.440
在這件事上容不得軟弱
There's no room for that on this one.


839
01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:45.240
你哪件事上容許軟弱過？
Tell me one where there was.


840
01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:09.800
早上好
Morning.


841
01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:29.320
昨天有70人死於巴格達一處集市上
Seventy people died in a market in Baghdad yesterday.


842
01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:41.320
上帝的意旨
Insha Allah.


843
01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.120
"上帝的意旨"？
God's will?


844
01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:52.810
還是妄以上帝的名義來殺人？
Or just a man who was arrogant enough to kill in his name?


845
01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.440
她很厲害
She's good.


846
01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:59.000
萊拉和梅裡克都被逮捕了
Leyla and Melik have been arrested.


847
01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:01.530
他們可能會被驅逐出境
They may be deported,


848
01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:03.370
就因為他們對你好
because they were kind to you,


849
01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:05.880
因為他們把你請到家中
because they invited you in to their home.


850
01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:09.290
跟我解釋一下 伊薩
Explain it to me, Issa!


851
01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:11.210
上帝的意旨？
God's will?


852
01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.410
你解釋一下 那個在巴格達
Explain to me why that man who killed


853
01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:15.370
殺了那麼多婦女兒童的人
those women and children in Baghdad


854
01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:17.370
和你父親的行徑又有什麼不同
is any different from your own father?


855
01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:19.090
我來漢堡是為了開始新生活
I came to Hamburg to make a new life.


856
01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:22.850
不 你來漢堡是為了找湯姆•布魯先生
No. You came to Hamburg to find Mr. Tommy Brue.


857
01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:24.690
你來繼承你父親的錢
You came to claim your father's money.


858
01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:28.090
我跟你說過 我不想要他的錢
I told you, I do not want his money.


859
01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:42.720
原諒我
Forgive me.


860
01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.480
或許
Maybe


861
01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:07.000
有一個把過去拋在身後的辦法
there's a way to leave your past behind, Issa.


862
01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:13.090
-拿著你父親的錢   -拿著你父親的錢
- Take your father's money... - Take your father's money,


863
01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:17.280
-用它來做好事  -用它來做好事
- and turn it into something good. - ...and turn it into something good.


864
01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:51.320
你的山羊被拴住了
Your goat is tethered.


865
01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:26.530
只是一隻普通的筆
It's just an ordinary pen.


866
01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:30.760
看起來像是筆 寫起字也像 聽起來也像筆
Looks like a pen, writes like a pen and listens like a pen.


867
01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:33.450
拆開看依然是筆
Take it apart, it's still a pen.


868
01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:35.450
你明白了嗎
Are you clear?


869
01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.170
-明白啦  -嗯
- Are you clear? - Mmm-hmm.


870
01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:39.690
你是代表一個富有的穆斯林客戶
You are acting on behalf of a wealthy Muslim client.


871
01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:40.770
我們都談過了
We've been over this.


872
01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.170
你是代表一個富有的穆斯林客戶
You are acting on behalf of a wealthy Muslim...


873
01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:43.370
好幾次了
Several times.


874
01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:45.370
他來這裡繼承一大筆錢
...who has come in to a considerable inheritance


875
01:26:45.380 --> 01:26:47.650
而這筆錢的來路很可疑
and the source of the money is questionable.


876
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.930
他想按照宗教精神
He seeks to distribute these funds


877
01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:50.130
捐獻出這筆錢
in a spiritually correct manner.


878
01:26:50.140 --> 01:26:52.320
真是的
For Christ's sake!


879
01:26:53.300 --> 01:26:56.200
我做這事不是為了你
I'm not doing this for you.


880
01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:59.040
不管是為了什麼 湯姆
Whatever it takes, Tommy.


881
01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:58.320
你好
Hello.


882
01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:01.720
抬起胳膊
Put your arms up.


883
01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.640
包
Bag?


884
01:28:20.940 --> 01:28:22.170
嗨
Hi.


885
01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:25.410
-嗨  -你好

886
01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:26.490
-布魯先生嗎  -是的

887
01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:27.610
-歡迎  -謝謝
- Welcome. - Thank you.


888
01:28:27.620 --> 01:28:28.690
我是賈馬爾
I'm Jamal.


889
01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:30.090
我父親在等你
My father is expecting you.


890
01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:31.890
-你能脫了鞋嗎  -好的
- Can you take off your shoes? - Of course.


891
01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:34.120
大衣交給我吧
I'll take care of the coat.


892
01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.450
布魯先生
Mr. Brue.


893
01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:44.720
-布魯先生  -幸會
- Mr. Brue. - An honor.


894
01:28:49.820 --> 01:28:51.290
你見過我兒子賈馬爾了吧
You have met my son Jamal?


895
01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:54.720
是的還有門外的一個人
Yes, and, uh, another at the door, I believe.


896
01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:57.290
請坐
Please sit.


897
01:29:02.020 --> 01:29:03.720
請
Please.


898
01:29:07.460 --> 01:29:09.170
正像我跟你解釋過的
As explained to you,


899
01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:12.410
我的客戶在德國的處境很敏感
my client's situation in Germany is delicate.


900
01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:15.400
這是他捐贈的具體內容
These are the details of his offer.


901
01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:19.570
你能看到上面有明確的要求
As you can see, there are specific requests


902
01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:21.890
一部分錢要送到車臣
for some money to be sent to Chechnya.


903
01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:24.680
醫院和學校
Hospitals and schools.


904
01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:28.850
也許這是個惡作劇？
Perhaps this is a joke?


905
01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:31.760
你加了個0來考驗我？
You have added a zero to test me.


906
01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:34.520
數額是無誤的
The figure is correct.


907
01:29:51.380 --> 01:29:54.320
這錢是哪裡來的
Where did this money come from?


908
01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.290
他得到這筆錢
It has come to him


909
01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:58.880
是出於繼承
in the form of an inheritance.


910
01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:02.370
我的客戶認為這錢不乾淨
My client has come to regard it as unclean


911
01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:05.130
希望在你的指導下散發出去
and seeks your guidance in disposing of it


912
01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:07.560
以符合你們宗教的方式
in a manner befitting your religion.


913
01:30:13.060 --> 01:30:15.810
你是個體面的人 我相信這一點
You're an honorable man, I believe that.


914
01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:19.360
可你告訴我 我為何可以信任你
But tell me, why should I trust you?


915
01:30:19.540 --> 01:30:21.890
我們當然必須信任對方
We must trust each other surely.


916
01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:25.330
根據我的客戶的意思 我願意
I am willing, under my client's instruction,


917
01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:27.530
把一大筆資金
to arrange for significant funds


918
01:30:27.540 --> 01:30:29.400
轉帳給你
to be transferred to you.


919
01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:32.210
你是個著名的宗教人士
You are known as a religious man.


920
01:30:32.220 --> 01:30:34.010
受信任的人
A trusted man.


921
01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:37.690
我相信你會把這筆錢
I accept you will direct this money


922
01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:40.040
用於他希望的用途上
to the purpose he intends.


923
01:30:40.420 --> 01:30:42.000
為何要這麼緊急呢
Why this urgency?


924
01:30:42.420 --> 01:30:46.600
我的客戶在德國的法律地位並不安穩
My client's legal status in Germany is insecure.


925
01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:50.240
我想建議你馬上接受這一禮物
I would recommend you accept this gift now,


926
01:30:50.940 --> 01:30:53.650
因為他可能用不了多久
because he may not be in a position


927
01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:55.400
就無權捐出這筆錢了
to offer it much longer.


928
01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:17.280
明早我需要你開車送我去漢堡

929
01:31:40.810 --> 01:31:43.400
-謝謝你 賈馬爾 -不客氣 父親

930
01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:56.280
布魯先生
Mr. Brue.


931
01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.200
-給  -謝謝
- Here. - Thanks.


932
01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:12.040
博士 請這裡來
Doctor, this way, please.


933
01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:25.010
阿布杜拉博士 我來介紹一下
Dr. Abdullah, may I introduce


934
01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:27.170
捐助人伊薩•卡爾波夫
your benefactor, Issa Karpov,


935
01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:30.680
和他的律師裡克特小姐
and his lawyer, Miss Richter.


936
01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.930
我想和伊薩單獨談談
I wish to speak with Issa alone.


937
01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:38.730
好的
Of course.


938
01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.680
裡克特小姐
Miss Richter?


939
01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:50.920
請告訴我
Please tell me,


940
01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:52.490
你為何決定
why you have decided


941
01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:54.880
捐出這麼多錢
to make this generous gift?


942
01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:57.840
是被脅迫的嗎
Are you under duress?


943
01:32:58.020 --> 01:32:59.170
沒有
No.


944
01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:00.570
看著我
Look at me.


945
01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:03.280
這是不乾淨的錢 先生
It is unclean money, sir.


946
01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.610
是一個做了大壞事的人的錢
It belongs to a man who has done great evil.


947
01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:12.610
我父親
My father.


948
01:33:13.340 --> 01:33:15.840
我希望擺脫他
I wish to be free of him.


949
01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:19.050
你做出這一捐贈
Whose sins do you renounce


950
01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.730
是拋棄誰的罪過
by making this gift?


951
01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:23.240
我父親的罪過
The sins of my father.


952
01:33:23.620 --> 01:33:25.800
你自己的罪過呢
And your own sins?


953
01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:34.080
我相信沒有上帝或者愛
I believe you feel lost,


954
01:33:34.420 --> 01:33:36.720
你迷失了自己
without God or love.


955
01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:40.920
你必須選擇真主的道路
You must choose the path of Allah.


956
01:33:41.220 --> 01:33:45.800
只有那時你才能真正解除這一負擔
Only then will you be truly free of this burden.


957
01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:04.490
布魯先生 我很滿意他的捐增是真心的
I am satisfied, Mr. Brue, that his offer is genuine.


958
01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:06.330
很好

959
01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:13.690
這是一些慈善機構的列表 及其銀行信息

960
01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:15.440

962
01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:33.530
看起來井然有序
It seems in order.


963
01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:38.320
我會等待進一步指示

968
01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:11.170
你需要專攻伯格多夫

969
01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:13.280
內政部的
Ministry of the Interior.


970
01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:15.770
是他最後拍板
The final decision will be his.


971
01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:19.970
我將會需要卡爾波夫和那兩個土耳其人的護照
I'm going to need passports for Karpov and the Turks.


972
01:35:19.980 --> 01:35:21.330
我們不做護照
We don't do passports.


973
01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:22.730
他向那律師保證過了
He gave the lawyer his word.


974
01:35:22.740 --> 01:35:26.880
是的 希望這次你們能把我的保證當回事
I did, and this time I want it to mean something.


975
01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:55.410
在上面
It's up there.


976
01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:15.890
我們查過了列表上的每個名字
We've checked every name on the charity list.


977
01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:18.080
都是乾淨的
They're all clean.


978
01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.440
巴克曼先生 請講
Herr Bachmann, please.


979
01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:29.480
你們在看著我 看著我們
You're looking at me, at us,


980
01:36:29.980 --> 01:36:31.930
可我們並不存在
but we don't exist,


981
01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:34.360
不是合法部門 不是正式部門
not legally, not officially,


982
01:36:34.380 --> 01:36:39.290
因為德國情報部門需要做一些
because German intelligence needs a job to be done


983
01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:41.610
德國法律所不容許的事
that German law won't let it do,


984
01:36:41.620 --> 01:36:46.010
因此我和我的人保持小規模
so me and my people we stay small.


985
01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:48.250
保持在街面辦公
We stay on the streets.


986
01:36:48.260 --> 01:36:50.560
應對各種困難
We make the weather.


987
01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:54.960
不會有線人主動找我們 是我們找到他們
Our sources don't come to us, we find them.


988
01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:58.650
成為他們的朋友
Uh, we become their friends.


989
01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:01.530
他們的兄弟、父親
Their brothers, their fathers,


990
01:37:01.540 --> 01:37:04.160
必要的話 成為他們的情人
their lovers, if we have to.


991
01:37:04.740 --> 01:37:07.730
只有當他們成了我們的人
When they're ours, and only then,


992
01:37:07.740 --> 01:37:10.370
我們才指引他們尋找更大的目標
we direct them at bigger targets.


993
01:37:10.380 --> 01:37:15.450
需要一條小魚才能抓到一條鯊魚
It takes a minnow to catch a barracuda.


994
01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:17.370
我這人並不釣魚 巴克曼先生
I don't fish, Herr Bachmann.


995
01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:18.970
就是打個比方 艾哈特
It's a metaphor, Erhardt.


996
01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:20.290
只是個比喻
Just a metaphor.


997
01:37:20.300 --> 01:37:22.690
我們慢慢來
We take our time.


998
01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:25.160
在一邊觀察 等待時機
We watch. We wait.


999
01:37:25.660 --> 01:37:28.050
看看真主能給我們什麼
We see what Allah provides.


1000
01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:31.050
這次真主給我們的
Uh, well, this time Allah has provided


1001
01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:34.600
是伊薩•卡爾波夫和他的數百萬不義之財
Issa Karpov and his ill-gotten millions.


1002
01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:40.130
你們從我的團隊編寫的報告中可以看到
As you can see from the report my team has compiled,


1003
01:37:40.140 --> 01:37:46.330
阿布杜拉博士提供了他滿意的慈善機構列表
Dr. Abdullah has provided an extensive list of his favorite charities


1004
01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:49.520
做為這數百萬元的受捐贈者
to be the recipients of those millions.


1005
01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:53.840
每一個慈善機構都被中情局查過沒有問題
Each one of those charities has been CIA cleared.


1006
01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.690
我相信他會把列表上
It is my belief he will replace


1007
01:37:56.700 --> 01:37:59.680
其中一個名字替換成另一個
one of the names on this list with another.


1008
01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:03.330
"七個朋友"船運公司
Seven Friends Navigation Company.


1009
01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:07.170
你能給我們什麼證據
What kind of proof can you show us?


1010
01:38:07.180 --> 01:38:09.210
我們正在尋找證據
Proof is what we're looking for.


1011
01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:11.560
假如這個阿布杜拉…
If this Abdullah,


1012
01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:16.640
假如這條梭魚 如果我理解了這個比喻的話
if this barracuda, if I've understood the metaphor,


1013
01:38:16.860 --> 01:38:19.010
吞了這個魚餌
takes the bait,


1014
01:38:19.020 --> 01:38:22.330
你們以什麼來確保他的合作
with what leverage will you secure his cooperation?


1015
01:38:22.620 --> 01:38:25.090
負面的手段有
On the negative, uh,


1016
01:38:25.100 --> 01:38:27.920
威脅起訴他 坐牢
threat of prosecution, prison,


1017
01:38:28.180 --> 01:38:32.210
公開揭發 讓他的慈善機構名譽掃地
uh, public humiliation, discrediting of his charities,


1018
01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:35.330
把他的老婆孩子驅逐出境
um, deportation of his wife and children.


1019
01:38:35.340 --> 01:38:38.520
我選擇正面的手段
I choose the positive.


1020
01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:44.360
特赦 給他公民身份 他曾申請過十幾次了
Amnesty, citizenship, for which he has applied half a dozen times.


1021
01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:48.050
我們要給恐怖分子的資助者公民身份？
Now we are offering citizenship to financiers of terror?


1022
01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:51.880
你們都瞭解了行動計劃吧
You are all familiar with the operational plan?


1023
01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:55.890
我們有三個小時時間來逮捕阿布杜拉 讓他成為我們的人
We have three hours to apprehend Abdullah and make him ours


1024
01:38:55.900 --> 01:38:58.930
並且在任何人發覺之前就送他回去
and get him back home before anyone notices.


1025
01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.850
假如他不肯遵從呢
And if he does not comply?


1026
01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:01.970
那就把他交給你們
Then he's yours.


1027
01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:04.370
你們可以隨意處置他
Do with him whatever you need to do.


1028
01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:06.650
伊薩•卡爾波夫呢
And Issa Karpov?


1029
01:39:06.660 --> 01:39:08.290
他不能碰
He's to be left alone.


1030
01:39:08.300 --> 01:39:11.330
在我看來 這是不可接受的
In my eyes it's unacceptable.


1031
01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:13.970
找別人在鏡頭前應付一下就是了
Find someone else to parade before the cameras.


1032
01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:15.570
我們說好了
That was agreed.


1033
01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:17.570
必須保護他
He has our protection.


1034
01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:20.520
馬莎 美國方面是什麼意見
Martha, what is the American perspective?


1035
01:39:21.100 --> 01:39:24.050
也許你可以幫我們確定一下
Maybe if you could define for us


1036
01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:27.800
你認為長遠的目標是什麼
what you think the long-term objective would be.


1037
01:39:28.660 --> 01:39:31.040
我們要實現什麼
What are we trying to achieve?


1038
01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:36.680
讓世界更安全
To make the world a safer place.


1039
01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:43.960
這還不夠嗎
Isn't that enough?


1040
01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:56.810
布魯先生
Mr. Brue?


1041
01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:59.450
明早
Tomorrow morning.


1042
01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:02.320
謝謝你通知我
Thank you for letting me know.


1043
01:40:15.740 --> 01:40:17.810
你感覺如何
How are you feeling?


1044
01:40:18.100 --> 01:40:19.680
很好
Good.


1045
01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:25.960
你送他去銀行 然後你就消失
You drop him at the bank and then you disappear.


1046
01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:29.250
知道嗎
Do you understand?


1047
01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:33.840
你是逼我背叛自己的父親
You are forcing me to betray my own father.


1048
01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:38.360
這不是背叛他 是挽救他
You are not betraying him. You are saving him.


1049
01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:40.890
這種行為是愛
That is an act of love.


1050
01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:00.200
他已經被給予保護
He's been granted asylum.


1051
01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:04.120
我只能幫到這了
It was the best I could do.


1052
01:43:13.020 --> 01:43:14.880
我給了你伊薩
I gave you Issa.


1053
01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:18.000
伊薩給了你阿布杜拉
Issa gives you Abdullah.


1054
01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:19.920
下面會發生什麼
What's next?


1055
01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:22.170
你將怎麼處置他
What will you do to him?


1056
01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:23.250
阿布杜拉？
To Abdullah?


1057
01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:24.800
是的
Yes.


1058
01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:27.880
不會是壞事
Nothing bad.


1059
01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:29.600
我保證
I promise.


1060
01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:03.720
看
Look.


1061
01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:07.320
這是什麼意思
What does this mean?


1062
01:44:08.220 --> 01:44:11.530
意思是你可以留在德國了
It means you can stay.


1063
01:44:33.220 --> 01:44:35.720
我有東西給你
I have something for you.


1064
01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.280
辦完後我會給你打電話

1065
01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:37.960
-博士  -你好 布魯先生
- Doctor. - Hello, Mr. Brue.


1066
01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:29.010
這是確認資金的轉帳
This confirms the receipt of funds


1067
01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:30.970
從卡爾波夫先生
from Mr. Karpov


1068
01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:34.850
轉到我們在這裡開設的新賬戶
in to your new account we've set up here.


1069
01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:40.360
這些是你列出的慈善機構及其銀行信息
These are the charities you specified with their bank details.


1070
01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:47.850
每一筆轉帳都已經錄入我們的系統 只等確認了
Each of the transfers is logged in to our system and is ready to go.


1071
01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:49.290
噢

噢
Oh.


1072
01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:52.560
請你再核對一下所有的賬戶信息
Would you please check all the details?


1073
01:46:52.900 --> 01:46:55.210
開戶人的姓名
The name of the account holders


1074
01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:57.450
轉給每一個受捐贈者的金額
and the money assigned to each recipient


1075
01:46:57.460 --> 01:47:01.280
然後你每一個都簽字批准
and then authorize each one with your signature.


1076
01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:56.770
我想替換一個
I would like to make a substitute.


1077
01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:59.240
我要改個賬戶名
I need to change a name.


1078
01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:01.850
"七個朋友"船運公司？
Seven Friends Navigation Company?


1079
01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:02.970
是的
Yes.


1080
01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:05.290
這是一家船運公司
It is a shipping company,


1081
01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:08.280
但其業務是慈善
but one whose business is charity.


1082
01:48:08.940 --> 01:48:11.570
我們得到世界各地的捐贈
We can have all the aid in the world


1083
01:48:11.580 --> 01:48:16.130
但也需要有船運給有需要的人才行
but it's worthless unless you can get it to the people who need it.


1084
01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:19.000
好的
Yes.


1085
01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:21.920
好
All right.


1086
01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:51.130
你的最後一個簽字
Your final signature.


1087
01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:25.290
非常感謝
Thank you very much.


1088
01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:27.130
失陪了
Excuse me.


1089
01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:43.480
對不起 爸爸

1090
01:49:44.610 --> 01:49:46.480
堵車了

1091
01:49:46.810 --> 01:49:48.900
一點走不動

1092
01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:58.160
很遺憾我兒子堵車了
Unfortunately my son is delayed.


1093
01:49:58.420 --> 01:50:00.690
讓我們給你叫輛出租車吧
Allow us to call you a taxi.


1094
01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:02.920
-我要去了  -祝你好運
- I'm going in. - Good luck.


1095
01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.440
好
Right.


1096
01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:16.760
喂
Yes.


1097
01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:19.800
"布魯兄弟銀行"要一輛出租車
Taxi for Brue Freres.


1098
01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:05.320
很榮幸
A pleasure.


1099
01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.530
祝你安康
As-salam.


1100
01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:17.320
我去白沙島
My direction, Blankenese.


1101
01:51:28.260 --> 01:51:30.000
退後
Stay back!


1102
01:51:31.220 --> 01:51:32.720
等等
Wait.


1103
01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:35.050
住手 你們不懂嗎
Stop! What are you doing?


1104
01:51:35.060 --> 01:51:36.800
-等等  -不
- Wait. - No!


1105
01:51:37.980 --> 01:51:39.450
不
No.


1106
01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.130
伊薩
Issa!


1107
01:51:41.140 --> 01:51:42.370
