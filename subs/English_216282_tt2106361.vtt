00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.120
<i>Hey, pass the bottle over.</i>

2
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.760
<i>- A little busy back here. Okay?
- Yeah, we can see that, David.</i>


3
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.440
<i>Yeah, you can get un-busy.</i>

4
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.840
<i>Oh, come on, Marce. I mean, you know,
we skipped graduation for this.</i>


5
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.160
<i>You are not graduating
down there, David Brody.</i>


6
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.960
<i>Hey, you better not be filming us.</i>

7
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.560
<i>No, just checking messages.</i>

8
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.800
<i>Oh, oh, your Trojan's in my head</i>

9
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.329
What was that?

10
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.040
- Do you see that?
- What?


11
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.325
Man. You guys seeing this?

12
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.920
- Whoa. Hey, Billy.
- Whoa. Ho-ho-ho.


13
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.560
Hang on.

14
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.760
- We should go.
- I gotta get this. Hang on.


15
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.280
- Can we go?
- Come on, let's go.


16
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.960
- Yeah. Hold on.
- Get in!


17
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.920
I will! Just give me one minute!

18
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.200
- Come on!
- Are you seeing this?


19
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.290
- Whoa!
- Billy, get in!


20
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.960
Oh, shit! Tornado!

21
00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.920
Oh, my God!

22
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.280
Get us out of here. Go!

23
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.200
<i>The tornado that struck
Oklahoma last night...</i>


24
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.280
<i>took the lives of four
high school students...</i>


25
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.320
<i>when it picked up their car
and tossed it into the air.</i>


26
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.280
<i>Tornadoes in this region of the Midwest
are common, but it only took a glance...</i>


27
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.840
<i>to know this was different.</i>

28
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.520
<i>Not so much a twisting
column but a behemoth.</i>


29
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.441
Great. We missed another one.

30
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.560
Hey, you guys know the
goal of a documentary...


31
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.600
is to actually document
something, right?


32
00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.200
<i>Copy that.</i>

33
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.520
We need a tornado.

34
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.280
That's it. We need a tornado. Yeah.
When was the last time we shot one, Lucas?


35
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.920
That EF4 that we shot a year ago.

36
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.200
Right. A year ago.
So we're 0 for 365.


37
00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.320
Let's figure that average. Hey,
Jacob, you play baseball. Right?


38
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.760
- Hockey, actually.
- Yeah? I played lacrosse.


39
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.840
- Really? No way.
- This is fun. It's like a family road trip.


40
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.160
- Did I miss something?
- Yeah, Jacob.


41
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.240
You missed everything.

42
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.600
No. Except we do have 200
hours of cloud sunsets...


43
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.360
and us going to every drive-through
from Idaho to Texas.


44
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.806
Which makes this the most
expensive home movie ever.


45
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.360
Just to be clear...

46
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.770
we're gonna get paid whether
we see a tornado or not, right?


47
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.401
Right?

48
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.128
<i>Where do you wanna go, boss?</i>

49
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.200
I have no idea, Daryl.
My job is to shoot them...


50
00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.560
<i>...not find them.</i>

51
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.840
- He's upset.
- What else is new?


52
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.720
Three months of that
broken record. I'm over it.


53
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.040
<i>Just be thankful we're in here
and not in the Titus.</i>


54
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.240
<i>- Must be brutal in there.
- You left the radio on, genius.</i>


55
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.680
Shit.

56
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.720
That probably didn't help his mood.

57
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.960
Screw his mood.
We've got other problems.


58
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.560
There's no way we could have known
that tornado was gonna hit.


59
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.240
<i>The National Weather Service
has issued a tornado watch...</i>


60
00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.160
<i>throughout Texas, Oklahoma,
Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri.</i>


61
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.480
Pete. National Weather posted a
tornado watch across five states.


62
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.160
Front's growing and moving fast.

63
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.400
I think this thing's gonna hit
about 200 miles north of here.


64
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.760
<i>Then we better haul ass.</i>

65
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.480
<i>If you're in the path of this storm,
you could be in for a very long day.</i>


66
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.760
Hey. So today is June 16th...

67
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.280
and this is my time capsule
message to the future me.


68
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.880
Um... This is gonna be recorded
and stored for 25 years...


69
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.371
when you, the 41-year-old
Donnie Fuller, will...


70
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.160
I don't know, see how
life's panned out, I guess.


71
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.880
Uh...

72
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.240
By now Dad is 65.

73
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.569
So Mom would have been...

74
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.040
Mom would have been 63.

75
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.130
Um...

76
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.120
What else? You're a junior
at Silverton High School.


77
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.240
You're head of the Video Club,
which is awesome.


78
00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.725
And...

79
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.120
And that's pretty much it.

80
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.480
So this is Casa de Donnie...

81
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.960
Where you spend most your time...

82
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.800
staring at the photo of Kaitlyn
Johnston and doing nothing.


83
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.800
- This is Trey, your annoying brother.
- Respect to you too.


84
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.600
By the time you see this,
Trey's gonna be in the state pen.


85
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.760
Heh. No way. I will be playing lead guitar
to 100,000 fans in Madison Square Garden.


86
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.524
But you will be stuck right here,
moaning over her.


87
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.120
This is Dad. He's the vice principal
at Silverton High School...


88
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.000
which is not the greatest for me.

89
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.360
- Uh, Dad?
- Hmm?


90
00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.930
Hey, come on.
I'm having breakfast here.


91
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.440
- Trey, I am leaving in five, ready or not.
- Relax!


92
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.600
Wanna say something to
the future you, Dad?


93
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.040
Not now, Donnie, okay?
Busy day. Can't you see that?


94
00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.400
Dad, you're the one...

95
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.240
that wanted these video-time-capsule
pieces in the first place.


96
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.680
This weather's gonna kill
the graduation ceremony.


97
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.200
We should postpone it.

98
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.640
Okay. This is time-capsule
interview, version number two.


99
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.600
What kind of man am I?
That's a hard question to answer.


100
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.040
I mean, how do you
describe perfection?


101
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.120
I thought you did your
interview already.


102
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.360
I did. Yesterday.

103
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.360
But then I remembered I look
way better in the morning light.


104
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.360
Lift with your legs, Dad.

105
00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.160
Come on, guys, 
I could use some help.

106
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.640
Ah, man, I can't. That old
soccer-injury thing with my back.


107
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.560
- Yeah? You get all that?
- I did.


108
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.880
Good. Get in.

109
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.561
Shotgun!

110
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.600
- Donnie, let's go.
- I'm taking my bike.


111
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.720
Dude. Chill. If you
want shotgun, just take it.


112
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.520
Hey, I'm sorry. With the storm and
graduation today, I got a lot on my plate.


113
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.600
- I know. It's always something. I'm used to it.
- What does that mean?


114
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.080
It means you're either
ignoring me or on my case.


115
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.400
- That's not true.
- If it's not my room, it's my grades.


116
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.760
Or it's this time capsule, which I'm
working my ass off to get done.


117
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.680
No. What's the point?
Nothing's ever good enough for you.


118
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.360
Stop for second. Let's talk.

119
00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.280
No. Busy day, Dad.
Can't you see that?


120
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.760
All right, Dad. Dad.

121
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:07.000
Right at this moment... Don't even think
about it before you answer. Just blurt it out.


122
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.440
...who is your favorite son?

123
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.326
Get in the car.

124
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.206
Well.

125
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.920
I know we missed it last night.
We couldn't get there in time.


126
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.330
Yeah. I know. I know.

127
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.040
Well, if you pull my funding,
that's it for me.


128
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.600
And we're onto a big one.

129
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.440
I don't know how big. 
It's a tornado.

130
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.080
They don't call to tell me
how big they're gonna be.


131
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.720
There's a massive storm front
moving through the area.


132
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.880
We're gonna get it.
We just don't have it yet.


133
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.200
Uh, well, she was your idea.

134
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.440
I wanted David Sinclair, remember?

135
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.249
Yeah. Well, I was getting a lot
closer without Allison and her data.


136
00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.880
It's an instinct game.

137
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.289
And she ain't got it.

138
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:53.640
Hey, Jacob. A little help?

139
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.840
- I can't. If I stop filming, Pete's gonna fire me.
- Dude.


140
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.680
Don't you dare let him bully you.

141
00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.800
Easy for you to say. You're not
the one sitting next to him.


142
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.120
You having fun yet?

143
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.880
Oh, yeah, dude. This is so
much better than CancĂșn.


144
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.160
I'm telling you, last year
we got within 100 yards.


145
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.400
It's like nothing you've
seen before. Trust me.


146
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.760
Okay, so larger system is moving
toward Riverside as predicted.


147
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:20.320
I think we should go here.

148
00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:24.320
The wind and precipitation readings in
the trailing cell look better for a funnel.


149
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.880
Exactly what you said about
Morristown and Osgood.


150
00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.560
This one's different. It's not following
the pattern. It's growing faster.


151
00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.760
It's growing faster.

152
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.120
Every storm chaser this side of
Hawaii is going to Riverside.


153
00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.040
Which, by the way, is where
I think we should go.


154
00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:40.200
But you want us to
go where? Silverton?


155
00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.120
If you would like, consider this an
instinct thing instead of a data thing.


156
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.000
If you heard that, then you also
heard that Steve cut us off.


157
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:50.240
- And it's on my dime now.
- I heard that.


158
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:52.520
This is months on the road.
And guess what.


159
00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:55.880
We got nothing you can't get on YouTube.
Worst season I've ever had.


160
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.440
You think this is instinct.
I think it's data.


161
00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.560
The fact is, it's neither
without a big fat dose of luck.


162
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:06.280
And there is nothing I
can do about that. Okay?


163
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.720
So back off of me.

164
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.600
I just want you and your data
to find me a goddamn tornado.


165
00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.567
Then Silverton's our best chance.

166
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.647
What do you think?

167
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.720
She's the one with all the degrees.

168
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.526
My money's on her.

169
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.890
Silverton it is.

170
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.760
You better be right about this.

171
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.440
- It's your last chance.
- Wow.


172
00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.960
Yeah, okay. Hang on. Okay. It's okay.

173
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.560
All right. We recording?

174
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:43.120
- We're good?
- You ready?


175
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.040
- Hell, yeah, man!
- Yeah! Get fired up!


176
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.680
- I'm ready!
- You ready for this shit?


177
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.240
Maybe we should get some
girls to watch this stunt, huh?


178
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:54.120
That's what I'm talking about. Get fired up!
Let's go for real! It's go time!


179
00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.240
- Let's go, let's go!
- Safety first.


180
00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:59.240
Okay, just do a test run first,
all right? Move, jackass!


181
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.162
- Get out of the way. Here we go.
- Come on. Yeah. You got it, buddy.


182
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.840
- Come on, buddy!
- Come on, Donk! Let's go, boy!


183
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.363
He's gonna check the
speed on this one.


184
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:14.080
Yeah! Do it, bro!

185
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.000
- Let's go!
- Test drive!


186
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.170
Let's go for the test drive!

187
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.360
There you go, Donkie!

188
00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.120
Well, that looked pretty good to me.
What do you think?


189
00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.400
Eh.

190
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.720
What? You wanna nail
some tail or what, dog?


191
00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:31.920
- I'm always up for nailing tail!
- That's what I'm talking about.


192
00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.840
Once this hits the Internet,
you'll be beating them off with a stick.


193
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.120
- Fours? Fives? All kinds?
- I'm talking fives, sixes.


194
00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.680
Fives, for sure. Come on!

195
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.361
- Bam!
- Trust me, buddy!


196
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.160
Yeah! All right! Hang on.

197
00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.040
- Richie! Record this, son.
- Are you drunk?


198
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.040
- Yeah.
- I'm just getting started.


199
00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.480
Hang on! Wait! We're gonna
light the pool on fire.


200
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:55.680
- Light that thing, Richie!
- Yeah! Light it up!


201
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.120
Light that puppy up.

202
00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.320
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!


203
00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.880
The Flaming Pool of Death!

204
00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:02.400
You ready to go?

205
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.600
Let's do this!

206
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:04.840
Action!

207
00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.442
That's right! Come on, Donk!
You got this!


208
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.886
Oopsie daisy!

209
00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.880
- That was awesome. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.


210
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.640
- Ha-ha-ha.
- That was awesome, Donk.


211
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.800
- A million hits, easy!
- Oh! A million?


212
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:27.280
- Maybe more!
- Hell, yeah, dude! We're gonna be famous!


213
00:11:29.020 --> 00:11:31.120
- Shit, my pool!
- Dude, your mom. Your mom.


214
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.800
What the hell are
you two idiots doing?


215
00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.640
- I thought you were at work!
- That makes any difference?


216
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:38.880
Look!

217
00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:42.484
<i>- That's the Titus! I've seen it on TV! Come on!
- Bye, Ma!</i>


218
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.960
<i>Let's take a tour of the ultimate
storm-chasing vehicle, the Titus.</i>


219
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.600
She's equipped with 24 surveillance cameras,
so we have eyes from every angle.


220
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.200
Bulletproof Lexan windows.

221
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.680
A gyroscopic stabilized camera.

222
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.487
A five-ton winch.

223
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.800
Four-millimeter solid steel armor.

224
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:18.520
Now, back here, we have a mini
weather center, complete with...


225
00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:22.886
an anemometer, humidity
sensor and potentiometer.


226
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:28.160
But the thing that makes her really
special are these grappling claws.


227
00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.160
Ah.

228
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.960
They can stabilize us in winds
up to 170 miles an hour.


229
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:37.769
We're not going anywhere
with those suckers dug in.


230
00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.650
Clear!

231
00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.411
This is the culmination
of my life's work.


232
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.520
What about the turret, Pete?

233
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.885
Right. The turret is up here.

234
00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:11.561
Which gives us a 360-degree
view of outside.


235
00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:16.360
It's fitted with a digital cinema camera that
will, when we find one of these bad boys...


236
00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.480
give us the shot of the century.

237
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.731
A sight nobody but God has witnessed:

238
00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.931
the eye of the tornado.

239
00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.881
That means "cut," Jacob. Cut it.

240
00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:33.960
Let's get some B roll.

241
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.640
Get shots of the claws, the instruments
on the back, panel stuff.


242
00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.960
- Just give me stuff I can use. Okay?
- Got it.


243
00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.369
My storm's expanding.

244
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.360
That means it's going to be really
big by the time it gets here.


245
00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.684
Hey.

246
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.723
How's my bug?

247
00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.280
Well, listen, um...

248
00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:02.280
I know I was gonna try and
make it home this weekend...


249
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:06.282
but we got a real big storm coming,
and Mama's gotta work.


250
00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:12.284
No. No. I'm gonna need you to tell
Grandma and Grandpa that we're...


251
00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.040
I know.

252
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:18.120
I know, sweet girl. I'm sorry.

253
00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:20.200
I'm really sorry.

254
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.040
Gracie...

255
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.921
Grace...

256
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.962
Hey, hey.

257
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:33.881
Did you get all that?

258
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.920
We can't postpone this, Gary. There's
not enough room inside for everyone.


259
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.400
- The weather's gonna be fine.
- It's your call.


260
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.480
There's Dad taking shit
from Principal Walker.


261
00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.200
I Will do that.

262
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.320
Did you get the last
of the interviews?


263
00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.520
I still got a few to do.

264
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.040
But what I did get was a nice shot
of Miss Bell's cleavage. Wanna see?


265
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.280
Trey.

266
00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.360
What? You don't get many
teachers with a rack like that.


267
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.320
Cut it out. We need to start
editing right after graduation.


268
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.800
Dad wants the clips online
by the end of next week.


269
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.280
What's the point of doing
a video time capsule?


270
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.840
Video won't even exist in 25 years.

271
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:11.680
What? Let's just get
it finished. Okay?


272
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.240
Fine.

273
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.560
Did you see the weather report?
Supposed to be a big storm coming.


274
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:18.240
Maybe they'll cancel the whole...

275
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:20.000
Whoa. There's your girl.

276
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.400
If I don't get it by the end of the day,
you'll not get the internship.


277
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.800
It's as simple as that.

278
00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.000
Oh, dude. Now's your
chance, man. Vulnerable girl.


279
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.160
Comforting guy. Right? Just go
talk to her and see if she's okay.


280
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.640
- We have work to do.
- Chickenshit. Come on.


281
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.480
I need to get the last of the interviews,
and Dad's, like, on my case about it.


282
00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:42.640
Screw Dad. Go do something
for yourself for once.


283
00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.245
Bro, I am literally begging you.
Just go talk to her.


284
00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.440
All right?

285
00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.680
All right.

286
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.160
Yeah?

287
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.920
- Stop.
- Heh.


288
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.800
Have fun.

289
00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:01.724
He's really doing it.
I gotta film this train wreck.


290
00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.280
And he's pulling into the station.

291
00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:06.530
Hey, Kaitlyn?

292
00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:08.160
Hey.

293
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.680
It's Donnie.

294
00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.320
Yeah. I know.

295
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.280
Strike one.

296
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:16.960
Are you okay? I saw you
outside with Miss Blasky.


297
00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.608
Right. Uh...

298
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:25.200
I had this application for an apprenticeship,
and it had to be submitted by the weekend.


299
00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.800
And Miss Blasky checked it for me,
and it's just completely corrupted.


300
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.641
I don't know what happened to it.

301
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.162
It was fine yesterday.

302
00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:40.360
Yeah. Yeah, that's toast.
What was it about?


303
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.160
The abandoned factory on Garner.

304
00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.000
- Oh, the paper mill?
- Yeah.


305
00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:45.320
Yeah.

306
00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:48.760
When they shut it down, the state
never paid for an official cleanup.


307
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.360
So there's all these chemicals and
hazardous materials sitting there...


308
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.080
contaminating the soil and probably
running off into the water.


309
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:59.040
- That's what the film's about.
- Pretend to be interested.


310
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.840
Anyway, the submission doesn't
make any sense at all without it.


311
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.360
- So I'm screwed.
- Come on, man. Take a swing.


312
00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.440
- You're into all this environmental stuff, huh?
- Come on, man. Just ask her out.


313
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.560
Gotta take care of the planet, right?

314
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.480
Or else the planet will take
care of us, right? Heh.


315
00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:16.960
That was awkward.

316
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.760
Heh. Yeah. Well, some of us care,
or at least are trying to.


317
00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.040
No. I'm sorry.

318
00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.760
I can help. I have all these cameras
and this editing software and...


319
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:28.400
- Really?
- Yeah.


320
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.400
Well, this will be easy.
We can reshoot this.


321
00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.924
- It'd have to be today.
- Today?


322
00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:37.760
Oh, you're filming the graduation.
No, it's fine.


323
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:40.880
No. No. My brother, Trey,
he's good with all this stuff too.


324
00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:42.480
- He can get that.
- No way.


325
00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.600
- Like, he can get that footage.
- Really?


326
00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.080
- It's not a problem.
- Sure?


327
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:49.047
- Yes, it's a problem.
- I'm sure. Yeah.


328
00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.600
Thank you so much.

329
00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.560
No. You have no idea what this means
for me. I owe you so big for this.


330
00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.320
No. Well, you know, me and
the planet go way back, so...


331
00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:02.920
Thank you.

332
00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.920
- I'll see you later.
- Cool.


333
00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.440
- Thank you.
- Okay, no.


334
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.600
This is so not cool.

335
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.089
You are kidding me.

336
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:14.210
What are you doing?

337
00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.040
What are you doing?

338
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.760
You're gonna skip the ceremony?

339
00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.520
Yeah. Yeah.

340
00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:24.240
You said do something for yourself,
so I'm doing something for myself.


341
00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:27.240
Yeah. And leaving me
to do all the filming?


342
00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.888
You can handle it. Right?

343
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:32.840
You can handle it, right?

344
00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:34.360
- Yes.
- Heh.


345
00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.600
Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Hey.
You go for it, bro.


346
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.440
But get some skin on camera.
E-mail it to me.


347
00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.760
- Just get the interviews, all right?
- All right, all right, I'm going.


348
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.960
Okay.

349
00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:50.161
Yo, Todd. We're rolling.

350
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.640
Yo, what's up, me?
How's life in the future, bro?


351
00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:59.640
So I just know by now you are playing
for the NBA, you're super loaded...


352
00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:03.560
and you got a super-smoking-hot
cheerleader wife.


353
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.960
So why the hell are you
watching this right now?


354
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.960
Why don't you get up to your
penthouse and bang her good, right?


355
00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:12.880
That's your time-capsule
message, Todd?


356
00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.120
Why not?

357
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:15.960
A message?

358
00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:20.840
Too late for me. Too late for these guys.
But my kids? Grandkids? Simple.


359
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.480
Study. Get good grades.

360
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:26.560
Or else you're gonna hang around this group
of losers shoveling shit all day. Sorry.


361
00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:29.840
Please marry a rich guy.
Please marry a rich guy.


362
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.442
Uh, we're rolling.

363
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:36.164
So, what would you like to
say to yourself in 25 years?


364
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.680
That was it.

365
00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:43.320
Twenty-five years' time? Ha! My guess is
we'd have blown up the world by that time.


366
00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:44.520
All right.

367
00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.800
High school sucked.

368
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.160
Hopefully, it was all worth it.
You've got your Ph.D. from Brown.


369
00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:53.000
You're doing research and
using your skills to help...


370
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.640
Douche-rocket! Ha!

371
00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.280
Sorry, man.

372
00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.480
- Radio check.
- Yes, sir.


373
00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.320
<i>Copy that.</i>

374
00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:02.880
Camera's good.

375
00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:07.240
Hey, guys. So you think we'll get
to see a tornado today or what?


376
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.720
You never know.

377
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.927
Jacob, did you bring all the
camera batteries? I only saw four.


378
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.560
I, uh, left them back
at the hotel on charge.


379
00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.760
Today is not a good day to run out
of power. We gotta go get them.


380
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.440
Let's get moving. This system's
supposed to hit within the hour.


381
00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.880
If that.

382
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.802
Come on, dude, get your shit together,
man. You're making me look bad.


383
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.520
Mike check. One, two, three.

384
00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.040
- Where's Donnie?
- Mike check.


385
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.371
- Yeah, it's good.
- I don't know. Around.


386
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:41.920
- He knows what time we're starting?
- Yeah, sure.


387
00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.920
Anyway, I can run the cameras.

388
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.480
All three?

389
00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:48.720
Well, yes, Dad. That's why
they invented tripods.


390
00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:50.526
Trey, this is important.

391
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.120
And I can't do it, right?

392
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.720
I didn't say that.

393
00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.129
You kind of did.

394
00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:07.400
Hey, Mom. How's Gracie?
She still mad?


395
00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.760
<i>She's 5 years old. 
She'll be fine.</i>

396
00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:14.046
I know, but I've been gone for months.
That's too long to be away from her.


397
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.680
I keep thinking it was
a mistake coming here.


398
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.640
MRS. McGEE: Allison, we're fine.

399
00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.160
<i>This is your job.
What you're doing is important.</i>


400
00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:23.360
I can't stop thinking about
those kids that died.


401
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.800
<i>What kids?</i>

402
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.960
Nothing, sweetie. Grandma and
Mama were just talking. But listen.


403
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.680
I am sorry about our call earlier, okay?
I don't want you mad at me.


404
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.480
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

405
00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.800
Real soon. The season's almost over.

406
00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.680
<i>Why can't you just come now?</i>

407
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:40.600
I wish I could.
I really do. I miss you.


408
00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.440
Allison!

409
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.000
Listen, I gotta go. But I'm gonna
check in every couple hours, okay?


410
00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.080
<i>Promise me you'll be home soon?</i>

411
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:49.320
I promise.

412
00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:51.160
Allison!

413
00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.720
I gotta go. I love you, bug.

414
00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.480
<i>I love you too.</i>

415
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:55.680
I'm coming, boss!

416
00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.480
<i>We have now confirmed that a
tornado has hit Riverside.</i>


417
00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:02.160
<i>All of Shaw County remains under
a severe thunderstorm warning.</i>


418
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:03.880
<i>Chuck, what do you see on radar?</i>

419
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:06.400
<i>What we're watching
now is this very rapid...</i>


420
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:08.000
- Data, huh?
- Shit.


421
00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.921
Maybe we'll catch the tail end of it.

422
00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.205
- What's going on in Silverton?
- Give me a minute.


423
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:22.680
Um, it's dissipating. There's some scattered
thunderstorms and that's about it.


424
00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.965
Thunderstorms? 
Thunderstorms.

425
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.560
Put everything in the van.
We're moving now.


426
00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:31.040
Where do you wanna go?

427
00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.000
You're not going anywhere.
We are going to Riverside.


428
00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.000
- How about...?
- We'll catch the next one.


429
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:40.161
Look. There's not
gonna be a next one.


430
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.360
Let's go.

431
00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.680
Look at the size of them!

432
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.080
- I thought you said it was dissipating.
- It was.


433
00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.360
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna check the Doppler!


434
00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:05.530
Right behind you, Allison.

435
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:07.600
Whoa, wait! Wait up!

436
00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.720
Oh, you see these, Allison?
These are huge!


437
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.481
Yeah!

438
00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.800
Ow! Son of a bitch!

439
00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:24.086
Oh, my God! Look at these, guys!
They're bigger than golf balls!


440
00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.920
Ah! Come on! Hurry up! Let's go!

441
00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.080
- What do we got?
- It's regenerating.


442
00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:36.320
And?

443
00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:37.920
Silverton.

444
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.200
It's coming.

445
00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:40.920
Great.

446
00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:42.760
Great.

447
00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.240
To all the students of this
year's graduating class...


448
00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:50.360
who have dedicated themselves to the
hard work necessary to reach this day...


449
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:54.203
you are now standing on
the threshold of adult life.


450
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.364
You are free to take your own path...

451
00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.280
and that path will be
different for all of you.


452
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:03.600
But it's now time to
create your own lives.


453
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.885
To create your own destiny.

454
00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.600
I mean, look at this place.

455
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.280
They should tear it down.
Decontaminate it.


456
00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.600
Plant some trees or a
garden or something.


457
00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:17.640
They should totally
build a skate park here.


458
00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.800
No, a garden. Definitely a garden.

459
00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.040
Yeah.

460
00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:25.086
So you wanna just put the
tripod down over there?


461
00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.520
- Wow.
- Hmm.


462
00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:37.646
- Watch your step.
- Yeah.


463
00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.520
I look okay?

464
00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.169
Yeah. You look beautiful.

465
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.009
I wasn't saying...
I was, like, for the...


466
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.160
I don't know. Uh, 
I'm rolling here.

467
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.685
- So whenever you're ready to...
- Thanks, Donnie. You're really sweet.


468
00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.606
Right.

469
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:03.120
<i>Pete, where are you?</i>

470
00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:05.404
I'm coming right up.

471
00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:13.600
- Got wall cloud to the east.
- Whoa.


472
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.160
Yeah, but no vortex.

473
00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.840
- Jacob. I got some circulation over here.
- Over here, got it.


474
00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.640
It's heading towards those trees.

475
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.320
<i>I'm on Oakwood Road.</i>

476
00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.360
<i>If you're in Shaw County, you need
to get yourself to a safe place now.</i>


477
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:28.240
<i>This thing is going to track right,
almost towards town.</i>


478
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.520
<i>There it is now. You can
see the wall cloud.</i>


479
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.080
<i>It's lower as it
transitions to the east.</i>


480
00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:36.960
- Just south. Right behind the base.
- Wow. Look at that.


481
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.560
Come on, baby.

482
00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.880
Come on, baby. 
Come on, baby.

483
00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:45.680
What are those idiots doing?

484
00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.320
- Aw, this is a beauty!
- Whoo!


485
00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:49.760
Yeah! Twista Hunterz, baby!

486
00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.089
Get in the field! 
Get in the field!

487
00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:54.680
Look at that funnel.

488
00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:59.171
We got a vortex. Come on.
Here we go, guys. Here we go.


489
00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.040
There's debris.

490
00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.880
- Jake, you getting this?
- Oh, yeah.


491
00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.120
<i>There it is.</i>

492
00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:07.120
<i>This tornado just touched down.
We can see it from here.</i>


493
00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.080
<i>It's ripping up trees.
It's ripping up everything in sight.</i>


494
00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.480
<i>If you're above ground, you need to get to
a storm shelter or a safe place right now.</i>


495
00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:17.160
I leave you with John Updike's words:

496
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.760
"You cannot help but learn more as
you take the world into your hands.


497
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.400
Take it up reverently...

498
00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:27.210
for it is an old piece of clay,
with millions of thumbprints on it."


499
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.080
Oh, great.

500
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.920
I guess we should, uh...

501
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.640
I guess we should start
finishing up, then.


502
00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.760
Whoo! Look at the
size of that sucker!


503
00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.360
Look how fast it's spinning, man!

504
00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:39.920
Shit! Man, that was close!

505
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:41.760
Dude. My arm hairs.

506
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:43.840
No. Dude, it's your "hairs" hairs!

507
00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.489
- They're standing up on your head, bro!
- Ha-ha-ha.


508
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:49.440
Come on. Come on.

509
00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.800
- That's the vorticity stretching.
- We're on, we're on. Let's move!


510
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.040
- I wanna report a tornado on the ground.
- Let's go.


511
00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.640
There's no damage yet,
but it's in a semi-residential area.


512
00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:01.800
About 15 miles to the north
of Silverton, Oklahoma.


513
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:04.004
Seniors! Stand up!

514
00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.370
Stand up!

515
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.280
We salute you!

516
00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:11.920
All right! Ah.

517
00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.320
Go inside, guys.

518
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.080
- Stay calm! Move inside in an orderly fashion!
- Everybody, back inside.


519
00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.120
- To the main building.
- Dude, come on.


520
00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.484
Quickly as you can.

521
00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.160
Shit!

522
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.920
Here we go! Quickly! Come on!

523
00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:34.443
Here we go! Come on, this way.

524
00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:39.680
<i>Pete, give me an update.</i>

525
00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.160
I'm gonna find the intercept
near Grant and Malcolm.


526
00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.400
<i>- Approach it from the east.
- Jake, you're out of focus. Tighten up.</i>


527
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.200
<i>You need to position yourself.
This thing is moving fast.</i>


528
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.880
I need a clear path.

529
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:53.000
I got a field coming up on your
right that should have access.


530
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.160
<i>Give me a second to
calculate rotation speed.</i>


531
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:57.524
Make it fast.

532
00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.960
<i>- Wind speed is 140.
- Direction?</i>


533
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.607
Southeast.

534
00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.840
- Lucas, we good?
- Yeah. We good. We good.


535
00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:06.520
You getting this, Jacob?

536
00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.326
Oh, yeah. Sure.

537
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:10.000
Okay. Ready for intercept.

538
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.806
Daryl, pull over.

539
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:22.520
- Get out there, dog! Get out there!
- Look at me!


540
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:25.120
- I'm in a tornado! I'm in a tornado!
- Whoo!


541
00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.483
- Yeah!
- Oh, my God!


542
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.000
We're in the path! 
We're in the path!

543
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.640
Okay. Anchor down. 
How we looking?

544
00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.925
- It's heading right for you.
- Get ready, guys.


545
00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:55.162
Oh, shit.

546
00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.520
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!

547
00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.567
Jacob! Don't you lose
it on me, you hear?


548
00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.800
Hold on, boys!

549
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.482
Shit! You guys, come on, now!

550
00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.689
This is crazy, you guys.
This is nuts.


551
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:19.122
Come on, come on! God!

552
00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.080
Shit, that thing is crazy!

553
00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.887
Hang on!

554
00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.408
It's coming right! Go! Go on!

555
00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.600
Damn it!

556
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.929
<i>It dodged to our left.</i>

557
00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.720
Oh, shit.

558
00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:52.765
It's headed for the school.

559
00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.880
Everybody! Okay, go!

560
00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.080
Here we go. Here we go. Keep moving.
All the way down the hall.


561
00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.800
Keep this door open. Come on.

562
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.640
- Move on in, folks. Move in.
- Come on.


563
00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.401
Jesus.

564
00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:08.240
Everybody into the
storm shelter area.


565
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.320
- Keep this hallway clear.
- Come on.


566
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.960
- Make sure nobody's behind us.
- All the way down!


567
00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.400
Go on, all the way in.

568
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.320
Trey! Where's Donnie?

569
00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:19.924
Uh, I don't exactly know.

570
00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:21.761
Get away from the window.

571
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.360
Tornado!

572
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.080
Get going! Run!

573
00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:40.127
Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Go, go, go!


574
00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.360
It's okay!

575
00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.000
All the way down the hall!
Keep going!


576
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.524
All the way down! Keep moving.
Come on. Fast as you can!


577
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.480
Okay, get down!

578
00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.840
Let's go. Come on.

579
00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.200
Face the wall!
Cover your heads! Stay down!


580
00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:57.041
Heads down, everybody!
Everyone stay down!


581
00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.566
Get your heads down!

582
00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:08.804
Get your head down.

583
00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.324
Stay against the wall!

584
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.001
No, no! Oh, my God!

585
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.680
Trey!

586
00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:37.361
Dad!

587
00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.080
Anybody hurt?

588
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.364
We're all right.

589
00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.531
- Trey?
- Yeah. I'm good.


590
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.440
You ready?

591
00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:12.011
Oh, hey, can you hold this?
You got it?


592
00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:15.600
- My dad.
- Are you gonna answer it?


593
00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.440
No. You kidding me? I missed
the whole grad ceremony. No.


594
00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.280
Is he gonna be pissed at you?

595
00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.480
Nah. You know what?
Trey will have filmed it.


596
00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.969
Oh, come on, pick up.

597
00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:31.367
- Trey, give me your phone.
- Yeah.


598
00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.760
- Trey?
- Donnie, you okay?


599
00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.280
Dad? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

600
00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.480
<i>Where are you?</i>

601
00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:46.320
Dad, Trey can handle all the filming
and stuff. It's not, like, a problem.


602
00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.680
Never mind about that. Are you safe?
Tell me where you are.


603
00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:52.320
<i>Safe? Yeah. I'm at
the old paper mill.</i>


604
00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.000
<i>- On Garner?
- Yeah.</i>


605
00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.960
Listen, it's really
important that you...


606
00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:59.520
<i>- Dad? Dad?
- Donnie?</i>


607
00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:01.320
<i>- Dad?
- Stay where you are...</i>


608
00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:02.520
Donnie?

609
00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.120
- Donnie!
- What happened?


610
00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.643
It just cut out. Here.

611
00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.200
Whoa.

612
00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:16.527
- Maybe we should go.
- Heh. Yeah.


613
00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:22.524
- What is that?
- I don't know.


614
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.124
- Come on!
- Aah!


615
00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.040
It's all right. 
It's all right.

616
00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:39.484
- Where are you going?
- I gotta get my son. He's out there.


617
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.640
Oh, my God.

618
00:34:02.740 --> 00:34:04.200
<i>From our vantage point...</i>

619
00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:06.320
<i>the damage could have
been a whole lot worse.</i>


620
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:08.480
<i>The tornado just narrowly
grazed the school...</i>


621
00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:10.000
Daryl, are you hearing this?

622
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.880
<i>...as you can see from this footage.</i>

623
00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:15.760
<i>The National Weather Service is currently
tracking a second supercell...</i>


624
00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.640
<i>moving in our direction.
I know it's hard to imagine...</i>


625
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.800
A second cell.

626
00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.760
- This is gonna be bad.
- How can there be another system?


627
00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.960
I've never seen anything like this.
These updrafts are insane.


628
00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.040
Got downed power lines.

629
00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:31.440
- We're stuck.
- It's all right. I'm about to make his day.


630
00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.720
<i>We're gonna send it back
to Don Lemon in the studio.</i>


631
00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.163
Heads up, Lucas. Live wire.

632
00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.360
What else we got?

633
00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:45.760
Activity heading toward
the center of town.


634
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:46.960
Second cell?

635
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:48.280
It's organized.
The hook echo is huge.


636
00:34:48.380 --> 00:34:51.320
I wanna set up as close to
the perimeter as possible.


637
00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.720
I wanna be in the middle.

638
00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.480
- I'm not gonna miss it.
- I hear you.


639
00:34:54.580 --> 00:34:57.040
<i>- Jake, how you doing?
- Never better.</i>


640
00:34:57.140 --> 00:34:59.600
You hang in there, honey.
That was nothing. Here you go.


641
00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.080
Send that to my GPS.
Let's roll. Come on.


642
00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:04.489
You want a coffee with that, boss?

643
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:08.206
Kaitlyn?

644
00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:11.960
Kaitlyn!

645
00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.240
- Are you hurt?
- Yeah. My leg.


646
00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.205
Okay. Your leg?

647
00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:18.960
Here, let me see it.

648
00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.920
It really hurts.

649
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.887
- Ugh.
- Hold on.


650
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.840
Okay. All right, hang on.

651
00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.324
- Don't touch it.
- Ow.


652
00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:39.082
I'm gonna tie this, okay?

653
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.084
- Be careful.
- Sorry.


654
00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.766
- All right?
- Yeah.


655
00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.800
What was Donnie doing
there in the first place?


656
00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:58.880
He's with Kaitlyn.
He's been in love with her forever.


657
00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.080
Johnston?

658
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:03.880
Yeah. He's shooting this
video project thing for her.


659
00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:05.480
Why didn't he just tell me?

660
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:08.800
I don't know, Dad.
You're so easy to talk to.


661
00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.765
I'm just saying.

662
00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.364
Whoa.

663
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.560
Oh, my God.

664
00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.280
Hey, boy.

665
00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:28.640
Hey.

666
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:31.083
Dad, that's Chester's dog.

667
00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.080
Chester?

668
00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:34.727
Chester?

669
00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:38.449
Chester!

670
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.363
Dad, be careful!

671
00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.480
- You okay?
- Had to go looking for shelter.


672
00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.720
Was gonna drive.

673
00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:49.960
Let me see.

674
00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:51.971
- You hurt?
- Get the door.


675
00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:57.160
The belt's stuck.

676
00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:58.400
I gotta cut him out.

677
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:00.480
Hey, can I get some help over here?

678
00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.480
Here.

679
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:07.051
- I know, I'm not supposed to have that.
- We'll talk about that later. Hang on.


680
00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.240
- Put this under him.
- Yep.


681
00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.649
- Right there.
- Put him down.


682
00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.040
- Can you get everybody to the high school?
- Uh-huh.


683
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:18.080
They've got a storm shelter.

684
00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:20.560
- You wanna go with them?
- No way.


685
00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:23.162
- Make sure he's okay.
- You got it.


686
00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:37.168
Oh, shit.

687
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.400
Oh, come on.

688
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.365
Try your phone again.

689
00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.201
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

690
00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:53.960
- Anything?
- There's no signal.


691
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.050
Damn it.

692
00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:01.850
There are those idiots.

693
00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.080
Pull over.

694
00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.600
Hey, Pete, you can pass us.

695
00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.080
<i>- Allison, we don't have time to waste.
- Yeah, we'll catch up to you.</i>


696
00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:12.640
Hello! Your main man Reevis here.

697
00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.640
- I'm with my buddy Donk.
- Badonkadonk! Heh.


698
00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.280
- What just happened?
- All right, so check this out.


699
00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.640
I was in a tornado, right?
And let me tell you. One word:


700
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:23.560
- "It sucked." Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha. That's two words, jackass.


701
00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.960
I know. Two words, but I was, like,
getting sucked up in the thing.


702
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.960
It was smart back
there with the knife.


703
00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.000
Thanks. I thought you'd be mad.

704
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:34.126
Oh, I am. Hand it over.

705
00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.842
We should turn left on Main.

706
00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:41.600
I'm gonna take the highway.

707
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.400
Dad, if we out through Main,
we can take Rosewood all the way.


708
00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.048
We save like 20 minutes.

709
00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.927
All right.

710
00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.160
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey, guys!


711
00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:54.160
Gentlemen!

712
00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.720
It's gonna be damn head. Ha-ha-ha.

713
00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:56.920
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Hey.


714
00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.880
- You two need to go inside and stay there.
- Whoa.


715
00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.400
You guys actually get
paid to do this shit?


716
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.240
I'm in the wrong damn job, man.

717
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.960
- You don't have a job.
- Heh.


718
00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.440
Let's go, Allison!

719
00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:10.120
Grab a brew. It's like a
zombie apocalypse out here.


720
00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.600
- We're wasting time.
- I don't think we can leave them.


721
00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.360
- Look. They're not our responsibility.
- They're drunk.


722
00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:18.520
- Guys.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. You getting this?


723
00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.761
- Look, look. Donk, Donk.
- Oh. Hell, yeah! Ha, ha!


724
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:25.360
Hell, yeah.

725
00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.530
Look at it.

726
00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:32.121
- Whoa, shit! Where did it go?
- Where'd it go? What?


727
00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.080
Where is it...?

728
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:37.445
- It's moving, it's moving, it's moving.
- Whoa.


729
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.926
Hey, Allison, what's happening?

730
00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.640
Keep filming.

731
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.400
- Whoa!
- Guys! Look at that!


732
00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.920
Reevis! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

733
00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.560
- Yeah!
- You getting it?


734
00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:59.000
No! No! Holy shit!

735
00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.204
- My truck!
- Oh, my God!


736
00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.400
Dad!

737
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:21.330
Get out and run for the bank!

738
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.000
Go! Go! Hurry! Hurry!

739
00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:26.681
Oh, shit!

740
00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:29.400
- Oh, my God!
- Dad! Hurry!


741
00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:31.047
Go inside!

742
00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.007
Trey!

743
00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.880
God!

744
00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.560
Hang on!

745
00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:48.240
- Oh, my God! No, no, no!
- Hang on!


746
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.960
Dad, hold on!

747
00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.689
- Oh, God! Aah!
- I've got you!


748
00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.440
Hold on!

749
00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:58.724
I won't let you go!

750
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:00.447
Grab the door!

751
00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.960
No. Dad, no!

752
00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:06.640
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

753
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.400
Are you okay?

754
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.331
Yeah.

755
00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.600
- Allison, you okay?
- Come on, Trey. Let's get in the car.


756
00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.160
- Everyone here?
- Yeah.


757
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.410
This is crazy, guys.

758
00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:29.165
Oh, shit.

759
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.930
Whoa.

760
00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:36.080
Hey, can I use your cell?
My son's out there. I got no signal.


761
00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:38.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh...

762
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:40.120
I don't either.

763
00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.320
Where is he?

764
00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:44.800
He said he was at an industrial
park on Garner Road.


765
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:46.160
Is that north of here?

766
00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.840
- This is crazy.
- This is what we're paying you for.


767
00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.520
Give me one second.

768
00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:52.440
Guys, what's going on?

769
00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:56.320
Daryl, can you believe this?
Your buddy here wants to quit.


770
00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:00.000
Hey. No one's quitting here.
Just give us a minute, Pete.


771
00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.125
You got a minute.

772
00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.330
You'll be okay. Right?

773
00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.440
This is crazy, man, all right?
I mean, a truck almost fell on us.


774
00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.680
Relax.

775
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.880
Make it through today,
and by next week...


776
00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:17.040
you got cash and you are sitting
on a beach sipping margaritas...


777
00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:21.326
with that beautiful girlfriend
of yours. All right?


778
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.320
- I don't even like margaritas.
- Heh. Trust me.


779
00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.960
Come on, we're wasting time.
Daryl, just take his damn camera from him.


780
00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.160
He's got this.

781
00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.680
- Let's get ready for the next system.
- All right.


782
00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.040
Another system?

783
00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:35.360
Wait a minute.
That was going north, right?


784
00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:37.560
That's toward the paper mill.

785
00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:40.400
I gotta get there. Can you
take us? My car is totaled.


786
00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.720
- Sorry. No time.
- His son's out there.


787
00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:45.890
Pete.

788
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.600
Just stay out of the way.

789
00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.640
You guys can come
in the van with me.

790
00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.680
- I can take the kid with the camera.
- Really? Sweet.


791
00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:55.169
No, no, Trey, you're staying with me.

792
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.760
<i>Look, the Titus is the
safest place for him.</i>


793
00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.080
He's right. It's a tank.
We'll be right behind him.


794
00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.160
- Just as far as Garner, okay?
- Right.


795
00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:10.840
Keep that camera rolling. When this is
over, I'll give you 3 grand for your tape.


796
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.040
- Three grand?
- Yeah.


797
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:15.040
- Heh. You got it.
- Now we're talking.


798
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.971
Let's move!

799
00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.044
How's your leg?

800
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.244
It's a bit better.

801
00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.805
Here.

802
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.209
- Ah.
- All right?


803
00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.964
Okay.

804
00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.400
Where'd you learn that?

805
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.731
Uh, my mom was a nurse...

806
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:55.480
so when we were kids, instead of story
time, we'd have, like, CPR lessons.


807
00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:01.480
<i>At the time I was kind of lobbying
for Cat in the Hat, but now...</i>


808
00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.731
Ha, ha. Yeah, thanks, Mom.

809
00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:08.202
- Okay?
- Yeah.


810
00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.969
Thanks.

811
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.843
I told my parents I was
going to the library.


812
00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.287
Your dad is coming, right?

813
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.680
Someone will find us.

814
00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.084
You okay?

815
00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:51.603
Look, I waited my whole
life for a storm like this.


816
00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.649
Please don't let me down.

817
00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:02.284
Who you trying to reach?

818
00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:04.640
My little girl, Gracie.

819
00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.880
I've never been away from
her this long before.


820
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.800
Where is she?

821
00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:12.687
She's with my parents about

822
00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.803
They'll make sure she's safe.

823
00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:22.726
Yeah. It just really feels wrong to be
away from her right now. You know?


824
00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.040
How old is Gracie?

825
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.687
She just turned 5.

826
00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.240
Wow.

827
00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:32.040
- They're a real handful at that age.
- She's a really good kid.


828
00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.080
How old is your other son?

829
00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:36.444
Donnie? He's 17.

830
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.846
He'll be all right. He knows
everything at that age.


831
00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:44.169
After his mom died,
I kind of lost him for a while.


832
00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.084
We'll find him.

833
00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:52.681
So is this what you guys do for a living?
Go around chasing trouble?


834
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.560
They chase. I study.

835
00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.844
Makes me the grown-up. Right, Daryl?

836
00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:01.840
I've never heard of this
many tornadoes before.


837
00:46:01.940 --> 00:46:05.240
It's a freak occurrence. Two storm
fronts taking the same path.


838
00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.840
It's not freak anymore.
Not after Katrina. Not after Joplin.


839
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.600
What used to be once-in-a-lifetime seems
to be happening about once a year.


840
00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.600
Look what happened
with Hurricane Sandy.


841
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:16.680
Whatever it is, we have
to figure it out...


842
00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.440
before they start shifting to
places they've never been before.


843
00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:23.520
- Like where?
- Like Los Angeles. Or Chicago.


844
00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.920
Even London.

845
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.400
<i>Tree blocking the road.</i>

846
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.360
- We got a problem.
- Can you get around that?


847
00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.600
No.

848
00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:33.320
<i>Moorpark. Right, Dad?</i>

849
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:36.240
<i>It's about three miles west.
It might be clear that far out.</i>


850
00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:37.440
Good call.

851
00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:40.202
Doubling back to Moorpark.

852
00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.128
That's a great boy you've got.

853
00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:49.243
Do you ever think about the last
thing you said to your mom?


854
00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.162
I think about it every day.

855
00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.090
Um...

856
00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.360
Because I was pissed at her.

857
00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.600
I was always pissed
at her for something.


858
00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:08.443
For leaving Dad.
For leaving me and Trey.


859
00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:13.768
We used to spend the weekends
with her, so she was...


860
00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:19.049
She was dropping us back, and she tried
to kiss me goodbye, and I just...


861
00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:24.883
I barely looked at her,
and she walked away.


862
00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:30.931
Yeah, that was it.
That was the last time.


863
00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:33.963
What happened?

864
00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:37.128
It was a car accident.

865
00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:41.200
- I'm sorry.
- No.


866
00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.245
It's...

867
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:48.280
You hear that?

868
00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.480
Hello?

869
00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:51.360
Hey! Hey, we're down here!

870
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:53.320
- Hello?
- Please help us!


871
00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.760
- What happened?
- I think a pipe burst!


872
00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.601
Oh, my God!

873
00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:04.200
Get on it, Donk.
You see anything yet?


874
00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.040
- I think the twister cloud's up ahead.
- Twister cloud?


875
00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:10.800
Shit! Slow down, Donk!
You're busting my balls!


876
00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:14.000
- Straight over this hill! You'll be fine!
- No! Not the hill!


877
00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:15.560
Hey! Moron!

878
00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.360
Oh, my God!

879
00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:22.360
Ugh! Damn! You dumb-ass!

880
00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.680
- What the hell, man?
- Whoo! Yeah!


881
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:28.000
- You all right, man?
- Yes! Ha-ha-ha.


882
00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.243
Whoa.

883
00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:43.482
Aw. This thing's awesome.

884
00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:46.360
- She's a beast.
- Absolutely.


885
00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.201
Wow, this is so cool.

886
00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.164
You gonna be all right?

887
00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:58.640
Look, I know I yell at
you a lot. But listen.


888
00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:02.483
When I first started,
I was scared shitless too.


889
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.160
We got a lot riding on this.
But when the moment comes...


890
00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.720
trust me, you're gonna be fine.

891
00:49:08.820 --> 00:49:10.970
Yes, sir.

892
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.120
You getting this on radar?

893
00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:15.560
I see it. It's headed
fast in this direction.


894
00:49:15.660 --> 00:49:18.040
<i>I got three small hook echoes.
Maybe four.</i>


895
00:49:18.140 --> 00:49:20.800
- D, you getting any visual on this?
- No. Nothing.


896
00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.040
I'm not seeing anything, you guys.

897
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.800
What's happening up top, kid?

898
00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:29.769
I got nothing up here. Just clouds.
Wait, there it is. Right there on the left!


899
00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.080
- Are you seeing this?
- Yeah, yeah, I got it.


900
00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.250
We got movement to the northeast.

901
00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:38.320
Take a look at that!

902
00:49:40.060 --> 00:49:41.721
Guys, it's splitting.

903
00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:46.883
- We're gonna have another funnel.
- Something's happening behind us.


904
00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:48.800
There's another one.

905
00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.323
There's one to our right!

906
00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.485
Two.

907
00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:57.960
There are three. Four!
Shit, they're everywhere!


908
00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.920
We have multiple
vortices touching down.


909
00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:04.205
These systems are too erratic.
We gotta get out of here.


910
00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.124
No, no, no!

911
00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:18.520
- Look at that thing!
- Aah!


912
00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:20.451
Oh, my God!

913
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:27.009
Oh, God!

914
00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.480
Look at the size of that thing!

915
00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.240
We're gonna be YouTube stars
for the rest of our lives!


916
00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.760
Ha, ha! Better than sex,
Donk! Ha-ha-ha.


917
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:48.442
How would you know?

918
00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:05.560
Dad!

919
00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:07.366
Behind us!

920
00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:15.840
Is everybody all right?

921
00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:17.487
- Yeah.
- I'm okay.


922
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.284
Oh, shit.

923
00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.920
- Keep filming!
- Yeah, I got it!


924
00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:53.880
This is unbelievable!

925
00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:56.000
- Dad!
- Are you all right?


926
00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:59.280
I can't get out the side.
We're gonna go through the back.


927
00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:02.042
- Trey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.


928
00:52:03.660 --> 00:52:04.800
Let's go!

929
00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:07.680
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Come on. Come on.


930
00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.601
- Trey!
- Over here!


931
00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:17.000
<i>We gotta take cover! Everybody in
the Titus! Run! Let's move! Move!</i>


932
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.920
- Come on!
- Let's go!


933
00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:21.010
Look out!

934
00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:23.644
Come on!

935
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.000
Everybody head for the church!

936
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.240
- Come on, Trey, stay with me!
- Look out!


937
00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.887
Holy shit!

938
00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:33.685
Oh, my God!

939
00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:46.441
This is amazing! 
I gotta get this!

940
00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.480
Jake, forget it!

941
00:52:48.580 --> 00:52:51.003
Jake, come on!

942
00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:52.847
Allison!

943
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.800
- Jake!
- Jacob!


944
00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:02.680
- My camera!
- Leave it!


945
00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.480
But I gotta get the footage!

946
00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.360
Jake, come on! Let's go!

947
00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:08.440
Shit!

948
00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.200
- No! No, no, no!
- Come on!


949
00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.962
Help me! No, no, no!

950
00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:25.160
- No! Jacob!
- No! He's gone! Allison, he's gone!


951
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.560
- Get inside!
- Shut the door!


952
00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.571
Come on, come on, come on!

953
00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:35.720
Get down!

954
00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:37.810
Okay.

955
00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:44.246
Oh, shit.

956
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.040
Trey. Trey!

957
00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:59.324
I'm here, Dad.

958
00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:04.005
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.


959
00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.720
- Where are you going?
- I'm getting my son.


960
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.120
Please, wait. It isn't
safe out there.


961
00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:13.529
What if it was your daughter?

962
00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:16.445
Um...

963
00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:20.680
If we can get the van back on the road, we'll
be safer than we would be on foot. Okay?


964
00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:23.123
Pete, can you hook up...?

965
00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:29.250
Is that all you care about?

966
00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.440
No. No.

967
00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:35.361
Jacob's dead, Pete.

968
00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:38.850
He'd probably still be alive
if it wasn't for you.


969
00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.969
You think what happened is my fault?

970
00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:47.000
I mean, he wasn't out there
shooting for himself, was he?


971
00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.560
He was getting your
shot for your movie...


972
00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:53.200
because you told him nothing else
matters, and you wouldn't let him go.


973
00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:55.040
No.

974
00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.284
It wasn't Pete.

975
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.640
It was me.

976
00:55:00.740 --> 00:55:03.160
I brought him here. 
It was my fault.

977
00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.800
No. No. None of this
should have happened.


978
00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:08.760
You gotta help him find his son.

979
00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.328
I will. What about you?

980
00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:14.323
I'm gonna stay here.

981
00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:18.204
I'll see if I can find Jacob's parents.
Get in contact with them.


982
00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:21.611
Okay.

983
00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:23.680
- Help me close up the gap!
- Huh?


984
00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:26.408
Help me close it up!

985
00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.768
- Can you stop it coming in?
- I'm trying!


986
00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:41.449
Lucas, you coming?

987
00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:42.760
Pete...

988
00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:46.842
Suit yourself. 
I gotta finish this.

989
00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.640
Trey, come on. Get in.

990
00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:51.322
- Let's go find your brother.
- All right.


991
00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:00.640
Come on, baby.

992
00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:03.080
Come on.

993
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:06.200
That's my girl.

994
00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:08.480
Dad, it's getting worse out there.

995
00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:16.963
Still no signal.

996
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.880
My phone. It's not working.

997
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:29.482
Try yours.

998
00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:32.120
No, there's no signal.

999
00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:34.440
- Try it through the gap right there.
- Okay.


1000
00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:36.920
Your arm can fit.

1001
00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:40.480
- Oh, my God. There's a bar, there's a bar.
- Put it on speakerphone!


1002
00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:42.560
<i>This is Gary. 
Leave a message.</i>

1003
00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:44.880
Dad! Dad! Please help us!

1004
00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:48.120
The building fell down on top of us,
and there's water pouring in...


1005
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:50.400
and I don't know how long we've got!

1006
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:51.840
Dad!

1007
00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:53.080
Aah.

1008
00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.000
Oh, shit!

1009
00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:57.523
Oh, shit.

1010
00:56:57.940 --> 00:57:00.000
I'm sorry. It's dead.

1011
00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:02.329
I'm sorry.

1012
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:12.520
Are you folks all right? I'm taking
these people to the shelter.


1013
00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:16.000
- You been by the industrial park?
- Sure have. Whole place has been flattened.


1014
00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:19.400
- Did you see anyone? A boy? A girl?
- I didn't see anybody. I'm sorry.


1015
00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.560
- Maybe he made it to the school.
- What if he didn't? We gotta go.


1016
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.560
Listen. I heard on the radio,
all the warning sirens are down.


1017
00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:28.447
If a tornado's coming,
you're not gonna know it.


1018
00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:31.725
Okay.

1019
00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:33.600
Mom.

1020
00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:35.645
Dad.

1021
00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:41.610
I just wanna thank
you for everything.


1022
00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:50.400
I was gonna come down the stairs
this morning to say goodbye...


1023
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.760
but when I came you
were already gone.


1024
00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:54.120
I got a message.

1025
00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:56.760
<i>Dad! Dad! Please help us!</i>

1026
00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.800
<i>The building fell down on top of us,
and there's water pouring in...</i>


1027
00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:03.560
<i>- ...and I don't know how long we've got!
- Oh, my God.</i>


1028
00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.401
You should know I'm not alone.

1029
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:11.808
Donnie's here.

1030
00:58:12.740 --> 00:58:16.449
He's been really sweet.

1031
00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:26.048
So it's kind of okay.

1032
00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:33.122
I love you so much.

1033
00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:41.724
Guess what.

1034
00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:46.446
I spent the last week filming time
capsules about people's futures...


1035
00:58:47.020 --> 00:58:49.887
and now it looks like
I don't have one.


1036
00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:53.680
So, uh...

1037
00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.362
if there's no future...

1038
00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:59.448
we should talk about the past.

1039
00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:01.241
Um...

1040
00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:03.960
Some bad shit happened along the way.

1041
00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:07.564
You know, like it does
to everybody, I guess.


1042
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:10.171
And...

1043
00:59:11.180 --> 00:59:14.923
And I didn't move on, Dad.
I blamed you.


1044
00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:20.609
I really gave you shit,
and I wish I hadn't.


1045
00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:25.407
I so wish I hadn't.

1046
00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:31.960
No point in wishing now, huh?

1047
00:59:32.060 --> 00:59:34.403
What do I wanna say? Um...

1048
00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.048
Go easy on Trey.

1049
00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:41.000
He's gonna tell you that
this is all his fault.


1050
00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:44.080
This was his idea. 
But it wasn't.

1051
00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:47.650
It's just Trey.
His attention-seeking behavior.


1052
00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.809
My idea.

1053
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:53.844
My fault.

1054
00:59:55.340 --> 01:00:00.243
Trey, you should be the person you always
were, dude, because you're awesome.


1055
01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.960
You're awesome and
I'm proud of you...


1056
01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:05.960
and just live every
day like it's your last.


1057
01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:08.801
Because, shit, someday it will be.

1058
01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:12.326
And for once, I know
what I'm talking about.


1059
01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.930
And, Dad...

1060
01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.409
Dad, I love you.

1061
01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.644
I really love you and I'm sorry.

1062
01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:30.689
Okay, I'm sorry.

1063
01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:33.520
Okay. Sorry.

1064
01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.040
Sorry.

1065
01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:36.320
Come here.

1066
01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.840
Okay.

1067
01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.487
All right.

1068
01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:02.963
Come on.

1069
01:01:07.020 --> 01:01:08.851
Take a left here.

1070
01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.131
Donnie!

1071
01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.200
Donnie!

1072
01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.480
Trey!

1073
01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.680
Look!

1074
01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.080
Hello?

1075
01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:29.091
It's Donnie's!

1076
01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.840
Donnie!

1077
01:01:30.940 --> 01:01:32.080
Donnie!

1078
01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.800
Where are you?

1079
01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.200
Kaitlyn!

1080
01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.768
Over here!

1081
01:01:38.100 --> 01:01:40.320
He said there was
water pouring in, right?


1082
01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.240
Dad! Over here!

1083
01:01:42.340 --> 01:01:44.720
Listen! Nobody move!

1084
01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.920
We're over here!

1085
01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.720
- Donnie!
- Dad!


1086
01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.360
- Where is he?
- It's okay.


1087
01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:53.640
- Donnie, I'm here!
- We got you.


1088
01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:57.000
It's okay! I'm here! I got you!
It's Dad! Can you hear me?


1089
01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.887
Dad! Trey!

1090
01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.200
Dad!

1091
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.800
Dad, you've gotta help him!

1092
01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.960
Can you swim through?
There's a gap here!


1093
01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.280
Now you hold on!

1094
01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:09.520
Donnie!

1095
01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:12.600
Gary, I can't move it!

1096
01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:17.040
We gotta move this! We gotta move
this I-beam! Come on, push it!


1097
01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.000
- It's not gonna move.
- Dad!


1098
01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:24.000
- Donnie, you're okay.
- Help me get her out.


1099
01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.200
You're doing good.

1100
01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.961
We're gonna get you out.

1101
01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.840
Trey, what are you doing?

1102
01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:30.480
Watch out!

1103
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:32.120
Okay, I need you to duck down!

1104
01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:34.080
We're gonna move this beam!
You understand?


1105
01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:35.841
Got it!

1106
01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:49.405
You guys Okay?

1107
01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.040
I got it. I got it. All right.

1108
01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.840
- Kaitlyn, come on.
- Are you okay?


1109
01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:02.762
- I got you, I got you.
- Let's go, let's go. Get her out.


1110
01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.000
Donnie!

1111
01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:10.250
Donnie!

1112
01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:44.280
- Donnie!
- I got him.


1113
01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.600
Pull him up!

1114
01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:47.080
I got his head.

1115
01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:48.800
Get him up.

1116
01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.000
Donnie?

1117
01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.640
Right here. Here we go.

1118
01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.320
Donnie!

1119
01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.800
Donnie?

1120
01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.402
Put this under his head.

1121
01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.560
He's not breathing!

1122
01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:01.120
Oh, God!

1123
01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.329
- Donnie!
- Oh, my God.


1124
01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:20.802
Donnie!

1125
01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:26.609
Breathe!

1126
01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:32.370
Come on!

1127
01:04:35.140 --> 01:04:38.600
Go on. Cough it up.
There you go. Come here.


1128
01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:41.320
There you go, son. Cough it up.

1129
01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.809
Here. It's okay.

1130
01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:45.840
I got you.

1131
01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.880
- Kaitlyn.
- It's okay. She's here.


1132
01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:49.560
It's okay.

1133
01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:52.480
I love you, son.

1134
01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.080
We got him now. 
We got him now.

1135
01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.480
Come here.

1136
01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.440
- I love you both.
- Donnie.


1137
01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.929
So much.

1138
01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:14.600
I thought you might need some help.

1139
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:18.363
Never thought I'd be happy
to see your face again.


1140
01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.280
Getting my hard drives.

1141
01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:24.320
- You were down there?
- Yeah.


1142
01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.920
- Camera rolling?
- Uh-huh.


1143
01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:30.444
- Mm.
- Yeah, there's the guy I know.


1144
01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.120
- Guys, we gotta get out of here.
- Come on.


1145
01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.131
<i>Everybody in the Titus.</i>

1146
01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.200
<i>We are tracking a massive tornado.</i>

1147
01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:43.560
Pete, you seeing this?

1148
01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.880
<i>- There's a second tornado formation.
- I see it.</i>


1149
01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:49.040
<i>This storm is heading northwest.
There. And it just touched down.</i>


1150
01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:53.040
<i>We now have two very large tornadoes
moving towards the town of Silverton.</i>


1151
01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:56.520
<i>All residents of Shaw County
should seek shelter immediately.</i>


1152
01:05:56.620 --> 01:06:00.000
<i>They are converging, which could
generate wind speeds of up to a...</i>


1153
01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.680
<i>There! There they go!
They just converged.</i>


1154
01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:07.040
<i>We are looking at wind speeds inside
the funnel of over 300 miles per hour.</i>


1155
01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:09.480
<i>This is definitely an EF5.</i>

1156
01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:11.960
This is the biggest
tornado I've ever seen.


1157
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:19.560
- The school.
- The whole town's in there.


1158
01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:22.200
Warning systems are out.

1159
01:06:22.300 --> 01:06:24.564
They're sitting ducks.

1160
01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:39.840
Okay, everybody out. Now. Let's go.

1161
01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:41.040
Hurry! Get out! Go!

1162
01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:43.120
What are you doing?
You out of your mind?


1163
01:06:43.220 --> 01:06:46.880
- There is another tornado heading this way.
- And you want us to go outside?


1164
01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:48.760
- You don't understand.
- You have to.


1165
01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:50.920
This is the storm shelter,
for chrissake.


1166
01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:52.840
- Not for this.
- Would you believe us?


1167
01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.840
We've been out there.
We know what this can do.


1168
01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:57.920
I am not going to risk it.
I've got hundreds of people here.


1169
01:06:58.020 --> 01:07:00.200
You will have hundreds of
dead people if you stay.


1170
01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.560
Sir. I've studied storms
all my life, all right?


1171
01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:05.880
This is bigger than any storm that
has ever been. Can you hear that?


1172
01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:08.880
- It will flatten this building in seconds.
- Exactly.


1173
01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:12.200
With or without you, we're getting
these people onto those buses.


1174
01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.642
- Trey, stay with me. Stay close.
- Okay.


1175
01:07:17.540 --> 01:07:20.930
Come on, everybody!
Get on the buses! Move!


1176
01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:23.487
We gotta go.

1177
01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:29.005
That one! That one over there!

1178
01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:31.802
- Stay with us!
- Let's go! Let's go!


1179
01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.360
Come on, move!

1180
01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:35.440
Trey, put the camera
down and get on the bus.


1181
01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.560
- I'm coming.
- Okay. Go, go, go.


1182
01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.321
Come on, folks.

1183
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:44.720
Come on! Let's go!

1184
01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.400
Everybody on. Move, move, move.

1185
01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:47.840
Come on, get in there.

1186
01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:49.726
Trey, get in.

1187
01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:54.525
- Come on, Trey, come on, come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.


1188
01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.964
Hold on.

1189
01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:06.080
Holy shit. Lucas, you getting this?

1190
01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.444
Yeah. We good.

1191
01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:39.044
- How we looking?
- It's still picking up speed.


1192
01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.204
Dad! Dad, the tower's coming down!

1193
01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.490
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Look out!
- Hang on!


1194
01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.480
Dad, be careful!

1195
01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.840
- We can't get through. There's no way around.
- We don't have any time.


1196
01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:16.840
- We gotta go back.
- Okay.


1197
01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:19.560
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah.


1198
01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:23.448
Come in the bus.
Come in the bus with us.


1199
01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:28.211
You guys, we gotta back up!
We gotta go back and find a road!


1200
01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.560
Gary, we need cover.
We can't stay in the open.


1201
01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.083
It's moving too fast.
We're not gonna outrun it.


1202
01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.524
<i>The road's blocked.
We gotta turn around.</i>


1203
01:09:41.940 --> 01:09:43.840
- No, Dad, pull over up here.
- What?


1204
01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:48.520
Dad, trust me, okay? I filmed here.
There's a storm drain. Right over there.


1205
01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:51.851
- Okay, everybody get off.
- All right, come on! Come on!


1206
01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:57.768
All right, this way!

1207
01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:02.680
Come on, you guys.
Let's go. Let's go.


1208
01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:05.040
- Come on!
- Follow me this way!


1209
01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:08.720
Dad! Dad! We can't get in this way!

1210
01:10:08.820 --> 01:10:11.280
- Go in through the manhole!
- Manhole?


1211
01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:13.640
- You got a crowbar?
- Yeah.


1212
01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:16.360
- I've never seen anything like this.
- Lucas!


1213
01:10:16.460 --> 01:10:18.405
Come on.

1214
01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.004
Here we go.

1215
01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:33.520
- Okay, everybody in.
- Everybody in!


1216
01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:36.400
- Come on. Let's go. Go! Go!
- Okay. Okay. Donnie!


1217
01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.843
Get in.

1218
01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.720
Jesus!

1219
01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:46.529
Come on! Come on! Hurry!

1220
01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.284
Come on!

- Now! Hurry up!
- Come on, come on!


1222
01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:58.600
Lucas, get in! Go, move! Go!

1223
01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:02.443
- Right behind me, guys!
- Yeah, go!


1224
01:11:05.860 --> 01:11:08.966
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.


1225
01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.840
- Give me a hand.
- I got it.


1226
01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:17.281
- Close it!
- Come on!


1227
01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:16.280
Oh, shit!

1228
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:20.080
- You guys all right?
- The truck opened the other end! Hang on!


1229
01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.800
It's gonna be a wind tunnel
in here! Hold on tight!


1230
01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.000
- Oh, my God, the grate's loose!
- Hold on!


1231
01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:28.160
- We're gonna get sucked out!
- Keep your head down!


1232
01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:36.040
Hey, this footage and data
could save lives one day!


1233
01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.721
What are you doing?

1234
01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:41.250
Pete?

1235
01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.480
- No, no! Wait!
- Allison!


1236
01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:45.206
Pete!

1237
01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.927
Pete!

1238
01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.087
Lucas! Give me that!

1239
01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:14.844
Peter, please, come back!

1240
01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.400
Gary!

1241
01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:35.840
No! Allison! I can't reach!

1242
01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:37.965
- Give me your hand!
- Aah!


1243
01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:49.841
Come on!

1244
01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:52.080
Come on. Come here!

1245
01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:56.320
Allison! Here. Come on.

1246
01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.520
You okay?

1247
01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:59.451
Yeah.

1248
01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:03.285
Okay, anchor down.

1249
01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:12.047
- What's he doing?
- He's trying to plug the hole!


1250
01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.810
Damn it. She won't stay anchored.

1251
01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:34.440
Allison! Allison!

1252
01:14:34.540 --> 01:14:36.760
<i>Can you hitch the winch
to something solid?</i>


1253
01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:39.522
- The truck!
- Yeah.


1254
01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.886
- The release.
- Here.


1255
01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:50.729
Okay, I got it.

1256
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:05.800
- We're good!
- All right, Pete, we're set.


1257
01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.050
<i>You can tighten her up.</i>

1258
01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.360
Okay, then.

1259
01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:35.930
<i>Titus versus tornado.</i>

1260
01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:43.327
- Dad, hang on!
- Gary!


1261
01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:58.322
Hang on!

1262
01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.560
Is that it? Is it over?

1263
01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:42.003
Pete, what's happening?
Did it pass us?


1264
01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:51.240
It's not gonna last.

1265
01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.490
We're in the eye.

1266
01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:56.164
Oh, God.

1267
01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:01.800
Guys, the trailing winds will be
even stronger! You've gotta hang on!


1268
01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:03.447
Okay.

1269
01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:07.409
Hold on tight.

1270
01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:21.731
Hold on!

1271
01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:24.882
Donnie! Get down!

1272
01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:57.640
It's not gonna hold!

1273
01:17:57.740 --> 01:17:59.401
Peter!

1274
01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.244
No!

1275
01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:24.924
Grab my hand! No!

1276
01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:27.924
- No!
- Gary!


1277
01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:43.240
<i>And let's see.
We're gonna stay right here.</i>


1278
01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:44.800
<i>We're gonna see if it re-cycles.</i>

1279
01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:47.240
<i>It's becoming more
of a barrel-shaped.</i>


1280
01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:51.560
<i>The wedge has decreased a little bit, and it
looks like it's roping out at Air Depot Road.</i>


1281
01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:53.200
<i>Look at the rope on that thing.</i>

1282
01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:57.160
<i>Feeder band looks like it's pretty low to
the ground. It's way lower than we are.</i>


1283
01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:00.286
<i>There it is. It's gone, Mike.</i>

1284
01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:10.080
- Everybody okay?
- I'm fine.


1285
01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:13.206
- Yeah, we're good.
- You're okay.


1286
01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:17.167
Trey?

1287
01:20:46.580 --> 01:20:50.120
<i>This was a storm that was on the ground
for at least 10 miles before it hit.</i>


1288
01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:53.520
<i>...assault by giant tornadoes.
And look how powerful they are.</i>


1289
01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:56.840
<i>One tornado is already being called
the largest tornado in history.</i>


1290
01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:59.040
<i>The intense storm that
set off the twisters...</i>


1291
01:20:59.140 --> 01:21:01.040
<i>dropped golf ball to
baseball-sized hail.</i>


1292
01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:05.680
<i>There's no denying the tragedy
that we've all endured here today.</i>


1293
01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:07.520
<i>But you know...</i>

1294
01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:11.761
<i>our faith will carry us through,
and we will rebuild.</i>


1295
01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:24.968
I'm sorry about Pete.

1296
01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:31.920
Hey, little bug.

1297
01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.680
Hey.

1298
01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.960
No, Mama's okay. I'm okay.

1299
01:21:36.060 --> 01:21:37.560
I am. I promise.

1300
01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:39.720
I'm coming home.

1301
01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:42.240
Yeah, Mama's coming home.

1302
01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:43.921
I love you too.

1303
01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.006
<i>In 25 years?</i>

1304
01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:58.000
It doesn't matter, you know?

1305
01:21:58.100 --> 01:22:02.000
Just taking it one day at a time.

1306
01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.887
Every day's just fine.

1307
01:22:05.740 --> 01:22:07.640
Because I'm alive.

1308
01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:09.280
That's it.

1309
01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:11.200
Nothing else matters.

1310
01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:16.080
Sometimes I think the human
race as a species is crazy.


1311
01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:18.920
But when the chips are down...

1312
01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:21.800
ordinary people, like you and me...

1313
01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:23.360
are good.

1314
01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.325
I like that.

1315
01:22:25.460 --> 01:22:28.201
You know, Pete and
I had our moments...


1316
01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:32.160
but I know why he got
up every morning.


1317
01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:34.280
And I know why
he gave up his life.

1318
01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:37.080
He wanted to make a difference and...

1319
01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.125
Um...

1320
01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:43.200
Well, hopefully this film
will help accomplish that.


1321
01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:45.040
Huh?

1322
01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:52.200
Uh, to be honest,
it didn't look good back there.


1323
01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:53.640
But we made it.

1324
01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:56.640
We stuck together, and here we are.

1325
01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:58.680
Alive.

1326
01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:02.360
I'm just grateful that we'll be able
to look back on this in 25 years.


1327
01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:06.320
Twenty-five years? Wow.
You are gonna be so old.


1328
01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:07.800
- Heh.
- And probably bald too.


1329
01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:09.200
All right, you're cut off.

1330
01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:12.246
Donnie, you have
something you wanna say?


1331
01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:18.000
Uh, I don't think we really have
to say anything, you know?


1332
01:23:18.100 --> 01:23:21.126
We're all here now. Together.

1333
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.160
And that's all that matters.

1334
01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.569
Yeah, it is.

1335
01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:28.600
Okay. Let's get back to work.

1336
01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:35.920
<i>Hey! Donk!</i>

1337
01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:38.080
<i>Donk, where are you?</i>

1338
01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.444
Over here!

1339
01:23:41.020 --> 01:23:42.520
Hey, you're upside down!

1340
01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:45.320
No, you're upside down!
And you're in a tree!


1341
01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:47.240
Well, so are you!

1342
01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:48.440
Oh, yeah.

1343
01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:50.520
That camera still working?

1344
01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:52.720
- Yeah, it is!
- Ha, ha.


1345
01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:56.000
- Man, we are gonna be so rich!
- Ha-ha-ha.


1346
01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.200
<i>Oh, shit! Donk!</i>
