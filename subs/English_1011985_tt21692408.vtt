00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:07.220
KUNG FU PANDA 4

2
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.220
Hey! Hey!

3
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.220
Hey!

4
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.220
Hey!

5
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.220
Hey!

6
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.220
That's right!

7
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.220
It is I!

8
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.220
I love you!

9
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.220
Can't be!

10
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.220
I have returned to take what is
mine, which is everything that is yours.

11
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:33.220
As if we know from the highest mountain to the lowest valley that Tylong
lives and no one will stand in his way but even the great Dragon Warrior.

12
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:50.220
Oh, where is Poe? 
He was supposed to be here hours ago.

13
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.220
Ping, will you please just relax?

14
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.220
I am ready!

15
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.220
Okay, I'm sure Poe is fine.

16
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.220
What if he's sick? 
What if he's hurt? 
What if he's hungry?

17
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.220
Don't get your noodles in a twist. 
If I know our son, he's probably just kicking back and catching some rays.

18
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.220
That's bad!

19
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.220
That's bad!

20
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.220
Getting worse!

21
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.220
Stop!

22
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.220
Okay, big guy, we're really going
to have to wrap this up.

23
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.220
No!

24
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.220
And next time, keep
your surf off their turf!

25
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.220
Yeah!

26
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.220
I'm late! Oh, I'm late!

27
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.220
The Dragon Warrior!

28
00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.220
What is and always will be!

29
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.220
We love you, Dragon Warrior!

30
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.220
Oh, and I love you too, adoring fan!

31
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.220
It's always cool!

32
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.220
Okay, okay, I'll sign whatever you want!

33
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.220
Master Shifu!

34
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.220
Master, let me just...

35
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.220
There, that's much worse.

36
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.220
We have to talk.

37
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.220
Absolutely, let's talk right after the ceremony!

38
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.220
Ceremony? What ceremony?

39
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.220
The Staff of Wisdom!

40
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:05.220
Given to me by Master Uruguay himself, it is said that
whoever possesses this staff has the power to travel between the realms.

41
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.220
The power to unlock the
door to the spirit realm.

42
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.220
And now, the power to open the all-new Dragon Warrior, 
Noodle's An Tofu!

43
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.220
Where the brass has kicked through
and the feed turns a knockout!

44
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.220
Dragon Warrior!

45
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.220
You're the scariest part of me, her too?

46
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.220
Unfortunately, no, they're off on
super cool kung fu missions.

47
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.220
Tiger's is taking on the free-range shipments like monkeys
hot on the trail of the missing the cat.

48
00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.220
Crane was crowned king of the crocodilians!

49
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.220
Long story!

50
00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.220
Vipers wrapping up peacocks between
the cobras and the mongooses.

51
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.220
What is it, mongies?

52
00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.220
And Mantis?

53
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.220
Wow, he's just trying to keep his
blushing right from biting his head off.

54
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.220
Just because they're not here in person
doesn't mean they're not here as life-sized cutouts!

55
00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.220
Now, who wants a picture?

56
00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.220
Okay, okay, one at a time!

57
00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.220
Uh, you!

58
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.220
My turn, my turn!

59
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.220
Thank you!

60
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.220
You really captured your disapproving scandal.

61
00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.220
We need to talk.

62
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.220
Now.

63
00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.220
Hey, can I get one
of those in a wallet size?

64
00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.220
Who?

65
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.220
Coming!

66
00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.220
Do you remember the first time you climbed these steps to the J
-Vous?

67
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.220
How could I forget?

68
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.220
I thought I'd never
make it to the top!

69
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.220
Yes, but you persevered, and once again, 
Destiny calls for you to take the next step on your journey.

70
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.220
The next step?

71
00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.220
What are you talking about?

72
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.220
I've already taken all the steps.

73
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.220
Haven't I?

74
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.220
It is time for
you to choose your successor.

75
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.220
Successor for what?

76
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.220
A successor to be the next Dragon Warrior.

77
00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:46.220
Oh, yeah, I get it.

78
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.220
Funny, because I'm the Dragon Warrior.

79
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.220
Wait, wait, wait.

80
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.220
You mean I'm not going
to be the Dragon Warrior anymore?

81
00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.220
Exactly.

82
00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.220
Then what am I going to be?

83
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.220
Once a successor is chosen, you will advance
to the highest level in all of Kung Fu.

84
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.220
Spiritual leader of the Valley of Peace.

85
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.220
Whoa!

86
00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.220
I don't know what that means.

87
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.220
It's just like Master Oogway before you.

88
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.220
You will oversee the Valley
passing along wisdom and aspiring hope.

89
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.220
Look, I appreciate the promotion.

90
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.220
I think I'm just going to
stick with the whole Dragon Warrior thing.

91
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.220
Dragon Warrior thing?

92
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.220
What is it you're hoping?

93
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:27.220
Our cookie?

94
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.220
Other hand.

95
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.220
The staff of wisdom?

96
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.220
I was given to you by Master Oogway.

97
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.220
You didn't really think it was so
you could open a restaurant or post pictures?

98
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.220
He wasn't super specific.

99
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.220
Oogway entrusted you with that staff
so you could follow in his footsteps

100
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.220
and become something better than you already are.

101
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.220
You take it?

102
00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.220
No, Oogway did not give it to me.

103
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.220
Being the next Oogway is not my destiny,

104
00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.220
which I have accepted
and am at peace with.

105
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.220
It's fine.

106
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.220
You don't sound fine.

107
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.220
You don't sound fine.

108
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.220
I'm very fine.

109
00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.220
Are you okay?

110
00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.220
You're fine.

111
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.220
This is an honor.

112
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.220
Oogway chose you as his successor
and now you must choose yours.

113
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.220
Master Shifu, I finally
found something I'm good at

114
00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:07.220
and now you want to
just take it away from me?

115
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.220
No one is taking anything away, Po.

116
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.220
Who you are will always be
a part of what you become.

117
00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.220
Yeah, but where's the skadoosh?

118
00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.220
You know what I mean?

119
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.220
Shut up!

120
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.220
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

121
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.220
but I don't know anything about
passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

122
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.220
All I know are two
things, kicking butt and taking names.

123
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.220
And if I'm being completely honest,

124
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.220
I'm not even that good at the name-taking.

125
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.220
Like, who's that fire-breathing crocodile?

126
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:31.220
I want to say Steve.

127
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.220
You were chosen to
bring peace to the valley,

128
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.220
and there are other ways to
bring peace than simply kicking butt.

129
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.220
Well, sure, but not any pun ones.

130
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.220
Please!

131
00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.220
Being the Dragon Warrior is all I know.

132
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.220
It's who I am.

133
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.220
Not anymore.

134
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.220
The Valley of Peace needs a spiritual leader,

135
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.220
and Master Oogway chose you.

136
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.220
We'll start interviewing candidates.

137
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.220
First thing tomorrow morning.

138
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.220
Candidates? What candidates?

139
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.220
Awesome!

140
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:15.220
No way!

141
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.220
No way!

142
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.220
He's a good dude.

143
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.220
Fantastic pose.

144
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:42.220
Master Poe will now
choose the next Dragon Warrior.

145
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.220
Mario!

146
00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.220
So many great candidates.

147
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.220
I'm going to let the finger decide.

148
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:57.220
Wait.

149
00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.220
Whoa, whoa!

150
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.220
What is happening?

151
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.220
The Dragon Warrior!

152
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.220
It's me!

153
00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.220
Like in a nut pole,
you have to choose a successor.

154
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:13.220
Yeah, nothing.

155
00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.220
About them said Dragon or Warrior.

156
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.220
You will know when you know.

157
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.220
How do I know when I know?

158
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.220
You know?

159
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:25.220
When I'm conflicted, 
I come here to ask the universe for answers.

160
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.220
Just as Oogway did before me.

161
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:28.220
I'm not conflicted.

162
00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.220
I'm just not ready for a next step.

163
00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:31.220
What is that you're holding?

164
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.220
The staff of Wisdom?

165
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.220
Other hand.

166
00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.220
A shoot-up peace bid?

167
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.220
Exactly.

168
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.220
Every pit holds the
promise of a mighty tree.

169
00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.220
How is this going
to help me find answers?

170
00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.220
Don't ask me.

171
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.220
Ask the universe.

172
00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.220
Be the pit pole.

173
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:49.220
Be the pit.

174
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.220
Yeah, there we go.

175
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.220
Alright, universe.

176
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.220
Give me some guidance.

177
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.220
Inner peace.

178
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.220
Inner peace.

179
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.220
Inner peace.

180
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.220
Dinner, please.

181
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:28.220
Dinner with peace.

182
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.220
Snow peas.

183
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.220
Dinner with peace.

184
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.220
Dinner with peace.

185
00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:36.220
Dinner with peace.

186
00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.220
Dinner with peace.

187
00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.220
Snow peas.

188
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:44.220
And a sesame soy glaze.

189
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.220
Inner peace.

190
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.220
Inner peace.

191
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:51.220
This is not working at all.

192
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:53.220
Maybe focus on your breathing.

193
00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.220
I'm trying, but it's kind of
hard when you keep talking to me.

194
00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.220
Technically, you're talking to you
if you think about it.

195
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:00.220
Hey, will you two be quiet?

196
00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:01.220
I'm trying to concentrate here.

197
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.220
Wait, if my post-intervoice, then who are you?

198
00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.220
Uh, I'm post-inter-intervoice.

199
00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.220
How many voices do I have in there?

200
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.220
You do not want to know.

201
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.220
What am I going to be?

202
00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.220
Are we alone in the universe?

203
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.220
The universe?

204
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.220
Is that you?

205
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.220
No.

206
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.220
Attention, mysterious figure.

207
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.220
The dragon warrior is here.

208
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.220
To perform justice.

209
00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.220
I know you're in here.

210
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.220
Just a matter of
time before I find you.

211
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.220
You can't hide from justice forever.

212
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:20.220
The dagger of Dengua.

213
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:23.220
You've got excellent taste. 
I'll give you that.

214
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.220
But I can't give
you that. Give it back.

215
00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.220
If you insist.

216
00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:41.220
Oh no, he's got a walking stick.

217
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.220
What are you going to do? 
Stroll me to death?

218
00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:46.220
This stick is not for the strolling. 
It's the staff of wisdom.

219
00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:49.220
The dragon warrior is going to be mad
when he finds out you took it stick.

220
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.220
I am the dragon warrior.

221
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:53.220
I'm just going to say it.

222
00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.220
Nothing about you says dragon or warrior.

223
00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:13.220
Are you desecrating the hologear?

224
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:15.220
Are you desecrating what now?

225
00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.220
Faster, ostriches!

226
00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.220
My bad.

227
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:21.220
You're a destructible chain hammer.

228
00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.220
Faster, wrangler!

229
00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.220
Deeper hand of whispering warriors.

230
00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.220
Which I've already broken.

231
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:41.220
Twice!

232
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.220
Why would you keep an urn of souls?

233
00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.220
It feels kind of creepy.

234
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:48.220
Are you doing okay there, big guy?

235
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.220
You're looking a little tired.

236
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.220
I've never felt more.

237
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:56.220
The war hammer of master chipmunk?

238
00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:01.220
You're going to pay for that.

239
00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.220
Hello?

240
00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.220
You faker!

241
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.220
It's not faking. 
It's called method.

242
00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.220
Catch you later, panda.

243
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.220
No!

244
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:31.220
I think I'll catch you now.

245
00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.220
Whoa!

246
00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.220
Told ya!

247
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.220
You got me, oh great powerful dumpling warrior.

248
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.220
That's dragon warrior!

249
00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.220
Let go of me!

250
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.220
Just tell me one thing.

251
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.220
How did someone like
you become the dragon warrior?

252
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.220
That's a mystery for you to solve during your
two years stay at the valley of peace prison.

253
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.220
Valley of peace prison? 
Sounds like a daycare.

254
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.220
It is a daycare on the weekends.

255
00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:14.220
But it's also a prison.

256
00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.220
There he is!

257
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.220
Dragon warrior!

258
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.220
As long as he's returned,
he demanded all of our iron.

259
00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:22.220
Then destroyed our quarry!

260
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:24.220
He's supposed to be in the spirit realm.

261
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:27.220
He said that he's not going to
stop until the valley of peace falls

262
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.220
and the dragon warrior bows before him.

263
00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.220
Please, you gotta do something.

264
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.220
Looks like I'm not the only one
around here with a mystery to solve.

265
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.220
Well, you know what they say.

266
00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.220
Every step leaves a footprint.

267
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.220
No matter how small.

268
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:46.220
Every step leaves a footprint.

269
00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:50.220
No matter how small.

270
00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.220
Very clever fox. 
You know something.

271
00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.220
Maybe I did.

272
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.220
Maybe I did.

273
00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.220
Maybe I did.

274
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.220
Maybe I did.

275
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.220
Maybe I did.

276
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.220
Maybe I did.

277
00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.220
Maybe I did.

278
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.220
Maybe I did.

279
00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:10.220
Maybe I did.

280
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.220
Maybe I did.

281
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.220
Talk to the fox. 
You know something.

282
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.220
Maybe I did. Maybe I know.

283
00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.220
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

284
00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.220
Tell me.

285
00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.220
And why should I?

286
00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.220
I mean, what's in it for me.

287
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:23.220
The peace of mind knowing
you did the right thing.

288
00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.220
You're adorable.

289
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.220
I don't ever tell you that.

290
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.220
And I don't mean just
like in the Cuddly Sons.

291
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.220
I don't have time for games.

292
00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.220
Tylona's running loose in the valley of peace.

293
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:35.220
Or maybe she wants you
to think it was Tyelon's way.

294
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.220
She?

295
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:46.220
The Empress of Disguise, capable of taking any form, mimicking any shape, the Master of Deception, the Lizard of Lies, or the Glowing Tea Lies, 
I'm talking about... the Chameleon.

296
00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:54.220
This is kind of a private conversation.

297
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.220
Who's the Chameleon?

298
00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.220
Only the most powerful shape-shifting sorceress.

299
00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:01.220
So she's shape-shifting in the Tailong!

300
00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:04.220
But what does she have against
me in the Valley of Peace?

301
00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:05.220
These are good questions.

302
00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.220
You should ask her.

303
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.220
You're right. How do I find this Chameleon?

304
00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.220
She isn't someone who can be found.

305
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.220
At least not without someone in the know.

306
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:17.220
And how do I
find someone in the know?

307
00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.220
No, it's me. It's obviously... it's me. 
I'm in the know. 
I'm in the know.

308
00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.220
Forget it. I'll find her on my own.

309
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:30.220
Good luck. After all, how hard can it be to
find someone who can look like anyone, blend in anywhere?

310
00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:38.220
Fine. You lead me to the Chameleon, and I'll
see what I can do about reducing your sentence.

311
00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.220
Deal.

312
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.220
What do you think you're doing?

313
00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.220
There's this shape-shifting sorceress on the loose.

314
00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.220
That's the job for the Furious Five.

315
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.220
Well, they're not here, and someone
needs to protect the Valley of Peace.

316
00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.220
Look, I know the change is difficult
and that you enjoy being the Dragon Warrior,

317
00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.220
but your job is finding the successor.

318
00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.220
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal. 
Mind your own business, Squirrel.

319
00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:03.220
Mr. Shifu is not a Squirrel.

320
00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.220
I'm a red panda.

321
00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.220
You know what? 
I love that for you.

322
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:14.220
Paul, this is your decision, but I think you
know what choice Master Oakley would want you to make.

323
00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.220
Thanks for the freeze day.

324
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.220
What do you want for a daycare?

325
00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.220
Not bad for a daycare.

326
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:24.220
Where's she going?

327
00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.220
Don't worry. I'll have her back
before you even know she was gone.

328
00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.220
You're supposed to be passing
along wisdom and admiring hope.

329
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.220
Just think of it as
one last Dragon Warrior adventure.

330
00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:38.220
I'll be back soon. 
Tell my dads I love them. 
I can't hear you anymore. Bye!

331
00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.220
Yeah, it sure is good
to be a free fox again.

332
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.220
That's a good back scratcher.

333
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:49.220
So does this really unlock
the door to the spirit realm?

334
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.220
It doesn't work like that.

335
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:53.220
It has to be given
in order to gain its powers.

336
00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.220
Gotcha.

337
00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:57.220
Given to gain. 
So, can I have it?

338
00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:58.220
No! What do you take me for?

339
00:18:58.220 --> 00:18:59.220
An easy mark.

340
00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.220
What's an easy mark?

341
00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.220
Someone who's easy to steal from.

342
00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.220
Usually because they're generous and too trusting.

343
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.220
Like you.

344
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.220
Aw, thank you.

345
00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.220
I heard the chameleon is a monster
with an appetite of a thousand predators

346
00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.220
and her favorite food is panda.

347
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:19.220
You say that this
chameleon miracle has magical powers.

348
00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:23.220
If you say her name three times,
she'll take you away in the night.

349
00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:27.220
The chameleon is as anxious
to look like any boy.

350
00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.220
Evens you.

351
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:29.220
For you.

352
00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.220
Mr. Lee, Mr. Lee, is it true?

353
00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.220
I was going to
take down an evil sorcerer.

354
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.220
The chameleon?

355
00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.220
Dragon Warrior's work is never done.

356
00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:46.220
Lee, I'm thinking, 
Paul, do you think that with the convicted felon

357
00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.220
to take down an evil sorcerer

358
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.220
who wasn't such a great idea?

359
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.220
Relax.

360
00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:55.220
Paul has faced demons, demigods,
and everything else in between.

361
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:56.220
He's always come out on top.

362
00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.220
And you're right.

363
00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.220
You're right.

364
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.220
And what if you're wrong?

365
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.220
Calm down, Ping.

366
00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.220
How bad can one evil sorcerer be?

367
00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.220
Who is she to summon us?

368
00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.220
Classic power moves.

369
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.220
We're the heads of Jennifer
City's most prominent crime families.

370
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.220
She's just some bug-eyed power-hungry reptilian.

371
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.220
You left out the evil sorceress parts.

372
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.220
We used to run the city.

373
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.220
Now we pay her
half the money we swindled.

374
00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.220
It's like a criminal can't
make an honest living anymore.

375
00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.220
Yeah, but what can we do?

376
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.220
Together, we can take her down.

377
00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.220
You nuts.

378
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:34.220
She's a shapeshifter.

379
00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:38.220
She could be at this very
table, and we'd have no idea.

380
00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.220
For all we know, you're the chameleon.

381
00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.220
Or you're the chameleon.

382
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:44.220
Or maybe.

383
00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:45.220
Oh, no.

384
00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:46.220
Maybe.

385
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:47.220
Don't say it.

386
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.220
I'm the chameleon.

387
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.220
I said, don't say it.

388
00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.220
We obviously spoke out of turns.

389
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:01.220
Sorry, chameleon.

390
00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.220
No, no, don't apologize.

391
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.220
You and your families prospered
by praying upon the weak.

392
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:11.220
So it doesn't feel good
when you're the one being squeezed.

393
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:17.220
Especially when the one doing the
squeezing is just a bug-eyed power hungry.

394
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.220
What was the rest?

395
00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.220
Reptilian Runt.

396
00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.220
Well, this Reptilian Runt wants more.

397
00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.220
You already have the city.

398
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:28.220
What else can you possibly want?

399
00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:30.220
I have something special in mind.

400
00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.220
I am very close to achieving it.

401
00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:37.220
As close as the blood moon, but
the blood mourn is two nights away.

402
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.220
So little time, so many expenses.

403
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:45.220
Which is why I'll need to
increase this month's tribute to 60%.

404
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.220
No!

405
00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:52.220
What was that now?

406
00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.220
I mean, no disrespect.

407
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.220
Don't worry.

408
00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:08.220
I forgive you for the impudence and the
backstabbing and the blatant disrespect you've shown me.

409
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.220
I forgive.

410
00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:12.220
But I never forget.

411
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.220
You might say I have the memory...

412
00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.220
Of an elephant?

413
00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.220
Of an elephant.

414
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.220
What?

415
00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.220
You think I pushed you too far?

416
00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:41.220
Then you, my friend, can begin to fathom.

417
00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:45.220
Just how far I can move.

418
00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:54.220
I expect your tribute by dawn.

419
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.220
Are we gonna stop for lunch soon?

420
00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.220
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

421
00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.220
But it does take the
occasional time out for snackage.

422
00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.220
Wanna split my almond cookie?

423
00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:10.220
You're just gonna give me half of your
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

424
00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.220
Mm-hmm.

425
00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.220
What's the catch, the rub, the bamboozle?

426
00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.220
The bam-wuddle?

427
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.220
You know, the fleece,
the ruck, the flim flam.

428
00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.220
The cookie or not?

429
00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.220
I got my eye on you.

430
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.220
How much farther is
it to this, the chameleon?

431
00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.220
Just a little further.

432
00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:36.220
What are you doing out here
in the middle of the night?

433
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:40.220
I didn't want to miss the
Earth and the blood moon rising.

434
00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.220
Oh, cool.

435
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.220
You are just as worried as I am.

436
00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.220
All right, all right.

437
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:47.220
I know pandas come across
as calm, gentle, and chill,

438
00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.220
but the truth is that they're not.

439
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.220
They're not.

440
00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.220
They're not.

441
00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.220
They're not.

442
00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.220
They're not.

443
00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:55.220
They're not.

444
00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.220
I come across as calm, gentle, and chill,

445
00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.220
but the truth is I'm kinda freaking out.

446
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.220
Oh, am I?

447
00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.220
Poe isn't too calm, gentle and
chill to face a sheep-shifting sorceress...

448
00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:06.220
What if he's captured?

449
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:08.220
What if he's tortured?

450
00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.220
Our baby?

451
00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:13.220
Okay, okay.

452
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.220
Maybe Poe has finally met his match,

453
00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.220
but there is still something that
he has that the Chameleon did not.

454
00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:20.220
What's that?

455
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:22.220
Us.

456
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.860
Now, let's go find our son.

457
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:26.060
My hope is okay.

458
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.060
You know, a wise goose once said,

459
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.420
worrying doesn't make the broth boil any faster.

460
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.460
Who was that?

461
00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.420
Me, of course.

462
00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:35.900
I was the wise goose.

463
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.740
Whoa!

464
00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.060
That's the biggest village I've ever seen.

465
00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.580
That's no village.

466
00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:45.540
That's university.

467
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:47.260
That's where I'll find the chameleon, huh?

468
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:48.820
Just a boat ride away.

469
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.220
And I'm gonna meet you
right to our front door.

470
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.140
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

471
00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.220
For the right price.

472
00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.620
Those cutthroats will take us
anywhere we want to go.

473
00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.820
Of course, we could always
up for the four-finger discount.

474
00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.820
No stealing.

475
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.020
The happy bunny tavern.

476
00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.420
Well, that sounds inviting.

477
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:06.260
No!

478
00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.020
Anybody lose a rabbit?

479
00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:19.620
Diner faster!

480
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.020
Welcome to the happy bunny tavern.

481
00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.220
I'll find us a ride, maybe
you can get us some food

482
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.020
and stay out of trouble.

483
00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:33.420
Hey, what you guys playing?

484
00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.020
Ah, John.

485
00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.620
The stakes are high.

486
00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.620
Can I play?

487
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.620
Surely you'll go easy on a beginner,

488
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.420
because I'm very beginning.

489
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:44.020
Hey there.

490
00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.820
We're gonna get a
boat ride in Juniper City.

491
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.020
Let's discount.

492
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.020
Who's he?

493
00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:51.020
He's the captain.

494
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:52.020
Thanks.

495
00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:57.020
Oh, I wanna get him.

496
00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.020
Beginner's luck, I guess.

497
00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.020
Emma, play me for her.

498
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.020
Oh, sorry, are you accusing me of cheating?

499
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.020
I would like to
speak to the manager, please.

500
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.020
I am the manager.

501
00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.020
I'll give you a
boat ride to Juniper City,

502
00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.020
but I won't carry anything illegal.

503
00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:13.020
I don't want any trouble.

504
00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:14.020
Trouble runs for me.

505
00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:16.020
Ah, then you'll cost you double.

506
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:17.020
I'm confused.

507
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.020
Should I have said that I like trouble?

508
00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.020
In that case, it'll cost you triple.

509
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:24.020
Uh, maybe we can go
back to the double price.

510
00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.020
You got a deal.

511
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.020
Great.

512
00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:30.020
Do I shake his hand or your hand?

513
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.020
Can I get anything else for you, ma'am?

514
00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.020
Yes, everything.

515
00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:35.020
Again, except for the broth.

516
00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.020
It was very bland.

517
00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.020
He's starting!

518
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:42.020
Whoa, one of everything is my go-to order.

519
00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:44.020
But how did you pay for this?

520
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.020
legally, lawfully, fair and square.

521
00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:48.020
I'm proud of you.

522
00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:00.020
Oh, wow, look at the time.

523
00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:01.020
Remember when we had to do that thing

524
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.020
down by the place with that guy?

525
00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:07.020
Didn't you actually think you could
drift a meal out of me?

526
00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.020
There's got to be
some sort of misunderstanding here.

527
00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:14.020
And apparently I'm the one misunderstanding.

528
00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:17.020
Please allow us to pay
for our meal and yours too.

529
00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.020
I'm only hungry for...

530
00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:21.020
Don't fling spend, Jets.

531
00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.020
Well then, come and get it.

532
00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.020
No, no, no, no,
don't come and get it.

533
00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.020
Destroy them!

534
00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.020
I got it!

535
00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.020
There you go.

536
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:55.020
Oh, better.

537
00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.020
Gotcha.

538
00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.020
Whoa!

539
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.020
I'll take that.

540
00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.020
Yeah, I think this belongs to you.

541
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:41.020
No stealing.

542
00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.020
No stealing.

543
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.020
Yeah, I think it's a
little too late for that.

544
00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.020
It's never too late
to do the right thing.

545
00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.020
Get those!

546
00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:11.020
Whoa!

547
00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.020
Whoa, nice move.

548
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.020
You gotta teach me that.

549
00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.020
You guys!

550
00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.020
Guys, I got...

551
00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

552
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.020
Whoa!

553
00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

554
00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

555
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.020
Ah!

556
00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.020
Ah!

557
00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:37.020
Ah!

558
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:39.020
Ah!

559
00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.020
Whoa!

560
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.020
Who designed the tower on a cliff?

561
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.020
We shouldn't have eaten all those dumplings!

562
00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:47.020
Huh?

563
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:49.020
Huh?

564
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.020
Ah!

565
00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.020
Ah!

566
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.020
Still how?

567
00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.020
Still how?

568
00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.020
Still how?

569
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.020
Still how?

570
00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.020
Still how?

571
00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.020
Still how?

572
00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.020
Still how?

573
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.020
Not that I'm worried, but...

574
00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.020
What if the chameleon knows we're coming?

575
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.020
What if the chameleon knows we're coming?

576
00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.020
I should be anywhere, anyone.

577
00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.020
Lee, would you please show a little backbone?

578
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.020
I'm sorry, but bravery

579
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.020
was never really my specialty.

580
00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.020
You don't have to be brave.

581
00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:25.020
You just have to act brave.

582
00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.020
Act brave.

583
00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:29.020
Got it!

584
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:31.020
Ah!

585
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.020
Ah!

586
00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.020
Hold on! Hold me!

587
00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.020
Please! Please!

588
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.020
No!

589
00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:41.020
I'm to you!

590
00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.020
How was that?

591
00:30:45.020 --> 00:30:47.020
Keep working on it.

592
00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.020
Juniper City

593
00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:55.020
It's gonna be great
to be back home again.

594
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.020
Does your family live there, too?

595
00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:59.020
They would.

596
00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.020
If I had a family, it wasn't easy

597
00:31:01.020 --> 00:31:03.020
being a little fox in a big city.

598
00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.020
So I had to survive

599
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:07.020
any way I could.

600
00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.020
I'd be shilling,

601
00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.020
gaffing...

602
00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:13.020
Stop running! Stop running!

603
00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:17.020
Whoa!

604
00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.020
You're an orphan, so am I!

605
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.020
Well, I mean, I was.

606
00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.020
My youth's dad adopted me

607
00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:25.020
and then later my panda dad found me.

608
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.020
Goose dads! Panda dads!

609
00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:29.020
Guess it takes all kinds.

610
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.020
Right, Mom?

611
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.020
Then one day a local took me in,

612
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:35.020
put a roof over my head,

613
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:37.020
gave me clothes to wear, food to eat.

614
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:39.020
After that, I was never alone again.

615
00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.020
I guess we both got lucky.

616
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.020
I guess. Hey, tell me something.

617
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:45.020
Back in the valley of peace.

618
00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.020
What did that angry little squirrel mean?

619
00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.020
Red panda.

620
00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.020
When he said you
had to find your successor.

621
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.020
Now that I'm supposed to become spiritual leader,

622
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.020
I have to find a worthy successor

623
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.020
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

624
00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.020
Once you're on top, that's
where you want to stay, right?

625
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.020
No, it's just that...

626
00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.020
What do I know
about being a spiritual leader?

627
00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:05.020
I can't even come up with
one of those cool sounding proverbs.

628
00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.020
Life's greatest enemy is...

629
00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.020
I don't know. Stairs?

630
00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.020
Okay.

631
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:13.020
Life's greatest enemy is time.

632
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.020
I guess it's just easier to

633
00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.020
hold on to the life you know,

634
00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.020
then move on to the one you don't.

635
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.020
Hey, that was pretty good.

636
00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.020
Yeah, maybe she should be the spiritual leader

637
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.020
of the Valley of Geese.

638
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.020
Whoa, that guy.

639
00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:29.020
Hey, drinks like a fish.

640
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:31.020
Should he be driving?

641
00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:45.020
We've come to pay tribute.

642
00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:47.020
As you requested.

643
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:49.020
Looks a little light.

644
00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.020
Go back out and get me more.

645
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.020
More?

646
00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.020
The chameleon.

647
00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:57.020
Go, before I toss you
down another flight of stairs.

648
00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:59.020
I'm gonna help you.

649
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.020
At last, my destiny.

650
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:03.020
My destiny.

651
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.020
My destiny.

652
00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.020
My destiny.

653
00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:09.020
My destiny.

654
00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:11.020
At last, my destiny approaches.

655
00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:13.020
My destiny.

656
00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.020
My destiny.

657
00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:17.020
My destiny.

658
00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.020
I expand my rule
from to the Pacific City

659
00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:21.020
to every city and town and village.

660
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.020
From here to the Valley of Geese.

661
00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.020
And beyond.

662
00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:27.020
And beyond.

663
00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.020
And beyond.

664
00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.020
They will all know the name.

665
00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.020
And beyond.

666
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.020
They'll come to hear the name.

667
00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:37.020
I got it. I got it.

668
00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.020
I had a vision. 
I saw the chameleon.

669
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.020
She's gonna take over cities and towns

670
00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.020
in the Valley of Geese.

671
00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.020
A vision?

672
00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.020
While you were asleep, 
I'm pretty sure that's just a dream.

673
00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.020
Not a dream!

674
00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.020
A vision. Either I had a
bad dumpling before I went to sleep

675
00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:53.020
or it's a dragon warrior thing.

676
00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.020
We gotta get to the
chameleon and take her down.

677
00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.020
Well then, you're in luck.

678
00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.020
Welcome to Juniper City.

679
00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.020
This is the place where you can be

680
00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:11.020
whatever you want to be, do

681
00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.020
whatever you want to do,

682
00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:15.020
and steal whatever you want to steal.

683
00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.020
If that's your thing.

684
00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.020
And...

685
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.020
Whoa! That came out nowhere.

686
00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:25.020
That came out nowhere.

687
00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:39.020
Whoa!

688
00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:41.020
Sorry!

689
00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:43.020
I've never seen so much traffic before.

690
00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:45.020
You don't have rush hour
in the Valley of Geese?

691
00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:47.020
No one's ever that much of a rush!

692
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.020
Come on!

693
00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:55.020
Well, it sure is
good to be home again.

694
00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:57.020
The sights. The sounds.

695
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.020
The smells.

696
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.020
That's a one-ton wonderland!

697
00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:13.020
Yeah!

698
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.020
Focus!

699
00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.020
This city is the most
amazing place I've ever seen!

700
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.020
I used to feel the same way

701
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:23.020
until the chameleon got her closet to it.

702
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:35.020
Tonight, we take down the chameleon.

703
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.020
Oh yeah.

704
00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.020
I'll show you where this villainous sorceress lurks

705
00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.020
as she dominates the city.

706
00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.020
Is she lurking in that
villainous tower dominating the city?

707
00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.020
How'd you know?

708
00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.020
And I'm my first
time taking down a villain.

709
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:51.020
Hey, hey!

710
00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:53.020
What type of scene?

711
00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.020
Wow, you're quite the local celeb.

712
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.020
Yeah, well, let's just
say a face like mine

713
00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:59.020
is harder to forget.

714
00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.020
What? You're a wanted criminal?

715
00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.020
You sound surprised. 
Is it surprising?

716
00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.020
I don't think this is surprising.

717
00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.020
You never mentioned you were wanted.

718
00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.020
Don't worry. The law has better
things to do to look for me.

719
00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.020
Hey, folks, we've been looking for you.

720
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:15.020
Must be a slow work week.

721
00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:17.020
I'll handle this.

722
00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:19.020
Morning, officers.

723
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:21.020
Dragon Warrior here.

724
00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.020
The fox and I are
here on official Dragon Warrior bids.

725
00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:25.020
Dragon Warrior what?

726
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.020
Dragon Warrior.

727
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.020
Anyone? Nothing?

728
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.020
Perhaps you know me better as...

729
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.020
The Kung Fu Panda!

730
00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.020
Wait, wait!

731
00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:39.020
Oh my god.

732
00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:41.020
Ah, come on!

733
00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.020
Okay, so we tried it your way.

734
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:45.020
Now we try it's on.

735
00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:47.020
What's your where?

736
00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.020
Sorry.

737
00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.020
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

738
00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.020
You can't run away from the law.

739
00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.020
You're a wanted criminal.

740
00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.020
Yeah, well, looks like
I'm not the only one.

741
00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.020
City life really is fast paced.

742
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.020
We gotta get out of
here before they call for...

743
00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.020
Back up.

744
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.020
That's a lot of bull.

745
00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:15.020
Run!

746
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.020
Yeah!

747
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:45.020
Let's go, let's go!

748
00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:15.020
Let's go!

749
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.020
Let's go!

750
00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.020
Very slow.

751
00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:43.020
Stop!

752
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:58.020
Sorry!

753
00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.020
Let's go!

754
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.020
We don't have time
for a drunk so long!

755
00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.020
We're trapped!

756
00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.020
It isn't much farther now.

757
00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:45.020
You always say that,
it's always so much farther.

758
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.020
Oh, what is this place?

759
00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.020
Home, sweet home.

760
00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:55.020
Some of the best crooks and criminals
in all of Juniper City live here.

761
00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:01.020
Careful, these guys will steal your
pants right off you, you'll never know.

762
00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.020
Uh-oh!

763
00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.020
Now you kids be careful of those fireworks!

764
00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.020
Wow!

765
00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:29.020
So you're friends with all these people?

766
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:31.020
They're practically family.

767
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.020
Is that really you?

768
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.020
Yeah, my old mentor.

769
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:43.020
I always knew someday you'll find
your way home back to the dead.

770
00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.020
And when you did...

771
00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.020
I'd be sure to
give you a proper homecoming.

772
00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.020
Family, huh?

773
00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:53.020
More like distant cousins.

774
00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.020
Alright, how should we do this?

775
00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.020
Quick and painless or slow and painful?

776
00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.020
Slow and painful!

777
00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:01.020
Slow and painful!

778
00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:03.020
Alright you little scamps,
slow and painful it is.

779
00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:05.020
Yay!

780
00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:07.020
You really don't want to do this.

781
00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:09.020
Because if you so much
as lay one claw on me,

782
00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:11.020
you're gonna have to answer to...

783
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.020
The Dragon Warrior.

784
00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:17.020
Warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior.

785
00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.020
Who?

786
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:23.020
Oh man!

787
00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.020
Are my adventures really that regional?

788
00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.020
Introduce them, Po.

789
00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.020
To your fists!

790
00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.020
Remember Po,

791
00:41:35.020 --> 00:41:37.020
there are other ways to
break peace than by kicking butt.

792
00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.020
Ah, come on, really?

793
00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.020
Now? Yes.

794
00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:43.020
Now. Hold on.

795
00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.020
Shouldn't my inner shifus have differing opinions?

796
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:47.020
We are in total
agreement with our mutual disappointment.

797
00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:49.020
And you?

798
00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.020
Wait!

799
00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:57.020
He who resorts to violence now,

800
00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:01.020
will only find more violence later.

801
00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.020
What?

802
00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.020
So what you're saying is,

803
00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.020
if we don't hurt Jen a little now,

804
00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.020
we can hurt her a lot later.

805
00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.020
What? No, that's not what I said.

806
00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:13.020
Yes, and more violence later,

807
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.020
it's better than less violence now.

808
00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.020
No, no, no, I think you're misunderstanding

809
00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.020
the fundamental point of...

810
00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.020
I think this makes my tummy tingle.

811
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:23.020
You know, that panem needs
a lot of good points.

812
00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.020
I like it.

813
00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.020
No, no, no, wait!

814
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.020
Come back!

815
00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.020
I'll come up with better wisdom.

816
00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:35.020
You have got to workshop those proverbs.

817
00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.020
Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?

818
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.020
Nope.

819
00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.020
The son of Mr. Penguin Lee?

820
00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.020
They were so both very common names.

821
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.020
Mentored by Oogway?

822
00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.020
Sorry.

823
00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.020
Trained to my master shifu?

824
00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:47.020
Oh, master shifu?

825
00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:50.020
Yes, everyone's heard of the legendary master shifu.

826
00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.020
But not you.

827
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:55.020
Someone say, legendary, bring it in.

828
00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:58.020
Look, Han, I know we've had our differences,

829
00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.020
but I'm really in a jam here,

830
00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.020
and I was hoping
you could help me out.

831
00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.020
Thank you.

832
00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:04.020
Don't drink that.

833
00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.020
We just need some place
to lie low for a while

834
00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:12.020
until the heat cools off.

835
00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.020
And why should I help you?

836
00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.020
Because deep down beneath that iron-scaled exterior

837
00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.020
is a good-hearted soul
who still thinks of me

838
00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:20.020
as one of the family?

839
00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.020
Fine.

840
00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:23.020
But if you still do my nightfall,

841
00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:26.020
I'm calling to both myself.

842
00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.020
Sleep tight!

843
00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:33.020
So tonight we take down the chameleon

844
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.020
after you get your pass back.

845
00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.020
Not cool!

846
00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.020
You guys, come on!

847
00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.020
Give them back!

848
00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.020
Those are custom!

849
00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:50.020
Yeah, this place doesn't look very friendly.

850
00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.020
Oh, oh, we did it!

851
00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.020
I'm sure everything is fine.

852
00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:57.020
This is a restaurant.

853
00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:58.020
These are my people.

854
00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:00.020
We speak the same language.

855
00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.020
You wait here.

856
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.020
Salutations!

857
00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:07.020
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

858
00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.020
I know you're having a good time,

859
00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.020
but I was wondering if a panda

860
00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.020
happened to be passing by these parts.

861
00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.020
There was a panda here.

862
00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.020
You know him?

863
00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.020
Know him?

864
00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:20.020
Why, I'm his dad!

865
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.020
What?

866
00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:29.020
You need to pay for what
your son did to my tavern!

867
00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:35.020
My boy wouldn't have
done this for no reason.

868
00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:37.020
Is it possible your broth was planned?

869
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.020
Try it!

870
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.020
No, no!

871
00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:43.020
The broth smells excellent!

872
00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.020
You should not have a single thing,

873
00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:47.020
especially not me!

874
00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.020
Hands off the goose!

875
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:53.020
The panda's back!

876
00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.020
He's back!

877
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:59.020
No, but you're about to wish he was.

878
00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:02.020
Because if you think he
made a mess of this place,

879
00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:05.020
you have no idea what I'm capable of.

880
00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:08.020
Everything he learned, he learned from me.

881
00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.020
Except one thing.

882
00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.020
Mercy.

883
00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.020
I don't know where he got that,

884
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.020
because I don't believe him.

885
00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.020
Now this can go one of two ways.

886
00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.020
The easy way,

887
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.020
in which you tell me where he is,

888
00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:29.020
or the hard way,

889
00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.020
in which you tell me where he is.

890
00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.020
But it's hard to understand what you're saying,

891
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.020
because you have no teeth!

892
00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:44.020
Mahjong.

893
00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:47.020
I eat mahjong tiles for breakfast!

894
00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.020
Mahjong.

895
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.020
I eat mahjong tiles for breakfast!

896
00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.020
I eat mahjong tiles for breakfast!

897
00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:15.020
What?

898
00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.020
Where is our son?

899
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:24.020
He took a boat to Juniver City.

900
00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.020
Which way?

901
00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:28.020
You know a wise goose.

902
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:29.020
Time to go.

903
00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.020
Yeah, right.

904
00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.020
Yay!

905
00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.020
Okay, let's try this again.

906
00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.020
Stir the pot,

907
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.020
roll the wok,

908
00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.020
serve the dish,

909
00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:15.020
and serve!

910
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:18.020
Hey, where's the Golden Dragon
that's supposed to shoot out?

911
00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:20.020
Not gonna happen with a broom.

912
00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:21.020
Yeah, still not bad, though.

913
00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:22.020
Yeah.

914
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:23.020
But stir later,

915
00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:24.020
roll higher,

916
00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:26.020
and the word is skadoosh.

917
00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:28.020
Skadoosh isn't a word.

918
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.020
And skablam is?

919
00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.020
I gotta say,

920
00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:45.020
you're not like any of
the other masters I've met.

921
00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.020
Yeah, no.

922
00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:47.020
There's not a lot of pandas.

923
00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:48.020
No.

924
00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.020
You're like a good guy.

925
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.020
Listen up.

926
00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.020
The coast is clear.

927
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.020
Fees,

928
00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:55.020
hit the streets,

929
00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.020
and you too,

930
00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.020
get out of my sight.

931
00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:19.020
I know I promised

932
00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:21.020
that I could lead you
right to the chameleon's front door,

933
00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:24.020
but the back door
seems a little more practical.

934
00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:25.020
I gotta say, Jen,

935
00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.020
you really are a fox of your word.

936
00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:29.020
A jude-

937
00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:30.020
Peach pit?

938
00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:34.020
One for Master Oogway's
peach tree of heavenly wisdom.

939
00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.020
Man, it's a valley of peace thing.

940
00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:41.020
It's supposed to remind me that every
pit holds the promise of a mighty tree.

941
00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.020
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

942
00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:50.020
Are you sure you want to do this?

943
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:53.020
As a wise spiritual leader once said,

944
00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.020
how may one kick butt

945
00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:58.020
if one doesn't seek a butt to kick?

946
00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:01.020
You're a real piece of work.

947
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.020
You know that?

948
00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.020
Thank you.

949
00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.020
Wait, was that a compliment?

950
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.020
Yes.

951
00:49:06.020 --> 00:49:08.020
Wait, was that a compliment or an insult?

952
00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:10.020
Yes.

953
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.020
Oh!

954
00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.020
Have you seen our son?

955
00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.020
Sorry.

956
00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.020
Sorry.

957
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.020
No.

958
00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:43.020
you've seen our son wait why they leave
it he said yes hey look Poe was here

959
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:47.740
amazingly but how can you tell me
parents have a gift for seeing others

960
00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:52.660
cannot come on there may
be more clues up ahead

961
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.260
yeah

962
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:23.980
that was close

963
00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.980
Who?

964
00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:26.980
Stand back!

965
00:51:29.980 --> 00:51:30.980
Whoa!

966
00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.980
They're coming! Hurry! 
Help me lift the cage!

967
00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:42.980
It's no use.

968
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:43.980
We gotta brace it with something.

969
00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:45.980
Here! Use my staff!

970
00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.980
Alright! Stand back! Here I go!

971
00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:50.980
Zhen?

972
00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.980
Where are you taking my staff?

973
00:51:55.980 --> 00:51:58.980
I think you mean my staff.

974
00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.980
You gave it to Zhen and
now Zhen has given it to me.

975
00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.980
Given to Zhen, 
I believe is how it works.

976
00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:07.980
You were right Zhen.

977
00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.980
He was an easy mark.

978
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:10.980
Zhen!

979
00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:11.980
First rule of the streets.

980
00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.980
Never trust anyone.

981
00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.980
I taught her that.

982
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.980
I didn't thought my apprentice was your friend.

983
00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:19.980
Apprentice?

984
00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.980
She's the one that took you in?

985
00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:23.980
Best thing that ever happened to her.

986
00:52:23.980 --> 00:52:26.980
You should have seen the little
gunner's type before I found her.

987
00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:29.980
Nangy and half-star.

988
00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.980
Hanging out with those rejects
from the Den of Thieves.

989
00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:34.980
No.

990
00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.980
She had no fear.

991
00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:59.980
Such potential.

992
00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:07.980
So I took her in.

993
00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.980
I made her what she is today.

994
00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:12.980
Stand up straight.

995
00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:13.980
Yes master.

996
00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:17.980
So you went through all of this just to
get me to give you the staff of wisdom?

997
00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:18.980
Why?

998
00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:21.980
I too came from humble beginnings.

999
00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:24.980
And dreamed of becoming something more.

1000
00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:26.980
I wanted respect and power.

1001
00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:29.980
I wanted to be
a master of kung fu.

1002
00:53:29.980 --> 00:53:30.980
Say what?

1003
00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.980
I was turned away from
every training hall I went to.

1004
00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:38.980
They would say I
was too small, too lowly.

1005
00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:41.980
And that kung fu was not my destiny.

1006
00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.980
And so I chose a different path.

1007
00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:46.980
Sorcery.

1008
00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:48.980
I grew.

1009
00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:50.980
I excelled.

1010
00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:53.980
And I got everything
I had ever dreamed of.

1011
00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:56.980
Everything except kung fu.

1012
00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:00.980
Just because I can look like Tai
Lung doesn't mean I can fight like him.

1013
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:05.980
You see Po, kung fu
may be performed by the body,

1014
00:54:05.980 --> 00:54:08.980
but its secrets are housed in the spirit.

1015
00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:11.980
And now that I have
access to the spirit well,

1016
00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.980
you're gonna steal Tai Lung's kung fu.

1017
00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.980
His and those of every
master villain that came before me.

1018
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:21.980
And once I do, no
one will dare underestimate me again.

1019
00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:23.980
You forgot about me?

1020
00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.980
Don't bother Po.

1021
00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:33.980
Those bars are enchanted with some
very old and very powerful magic.

1022
00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.980
You'd need at least ten
dragon warriors to get through them.

1023
00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.980
Then I won't go through them.

1024
00:54:39.980 --> 00:54:41.980
I'll go under them.

1025
00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:48.980
That's frustrating for all sorts of reasons.

1026
00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:13.980
The Grand Master is here.

1027
00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.980
Hello!

1028
00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.980
How are you?

1029
00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.980
I'm good.

1030
00:55:20.980 --> 00:55:22.980
I'm okay.

1031
00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.980
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1032
00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:26.980
I'm okay!

1033
00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:29.980
I'm okay, I'm okay!

1034
00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:31.980
I'm okay, I'm okay!

1035
00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:33.980
I'm okay!

1036
00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:35.980
I'm okay!

1037
00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:37.980
I'm okay!

1038
00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:39.980
I'm okay!

1039
00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:42.480
I'm sorry I lied to you. 
I was just doing what I was told.

1040
00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.980
Apologize later. Right now, 
I have to stop the chameleon.

1041
00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:45.980
Oh!

1042
00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:47.980
Shen?

1043
00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:53.980
No!

1044
00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:01.980
Well done, Shen.

1045
00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.980
You never said you were gonna hurt him.

1046
00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:06.980
Watch the second rule of the streets.

1047
00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:11.980
Someone always gets hurt and
makes sure it's never you.

1048
00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:14.980
I just wish there had been another way.

1049
00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.980
Third rule of the streets?

1050
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:17.980
Third rule?

1051
00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.980
Some would say it's the most important.

1052
00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:24.980
No one is interested in your feelings.

1053
00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:28.980
Chomp, chomp. We have
a spirit realm to plunder.

1054
00:56:28.980 --> 00:56:30.980
And smile.

1055
00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:32.980
Nobody likes a grouch.

1056
00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:36.980
Honestly, Shen, 
I know no way I'd make up such bad habits.

1057
00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:50.980
Be there, man.

1058
00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:55.980
Get on me!

1059
00:56:55.980 --> 00:56:57.980
No!

1060
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.980
No, son!

1061
00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:12.980
No, save me!

1062
00:57:14.980 --> 00:57:16.980
Alright, son.

1063
00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.980
It's okay. We've got you, Paul. 
We've got you.

1064
00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:25.980
So you followed me.

1065
00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:26.980
It was his idea.

1066
00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:28.980
Okay, okay. It was both our ideas.

1067
00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:30.980
We only followed because we'd love.

1068
00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:31.980
No.

1069
00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:34.980
You followed because you didn't believe in me.

1070
00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:36.980
And because we love?

1071
00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:39.980
Well, you're right.

1072
00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:42.980
I screwed up a big time.

1073
00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.980
I trusted the wrong person.

1074
00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:47.980
I gave the staff of
wisdom right to the chameleon.

1075
00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:50.980
Paul.

1076
00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:51.980
Paul.

1077
00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.980
That was a very big time screw-up.

1078
00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:00.980
If only I'd listened to Master Shifu
and stayed in the Valley of Peace.

1079
00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:04.980
The chameleon wouldn't have my staff
and none of this would be happening.

1080
00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.980
I was just so determined to
keep things the way they were.

1081
00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:10.980
Everyone is afraid of change, Paul.

1082
00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:12.980
Even me.

1083
00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:15.980
There was a time, not so long ago,

1084
00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:20.980
when all I wanted to be was
the greatest noodle chef in the Valley.

1085
00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.980
So what happened?

1086
00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:24.980
I became the greatest
noodle chef in the Valley.

1087
00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:25.980
It's true.

1088
00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.980
But I also became a father.

1089
00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:32.980
And nothing, nothing's ever been the same since.

1090
00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.980
Change doesn't always have
to be a bad thing.

1091
00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:39.980
Why do you think I always
change the menu at the restaurant?

1092
00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:42.980
Because if things stayed the same forever,

1093
00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:46.980
sooner or later, they would lose their flavor.

1094
00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:48.980
He's right, Paul.

1095
00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:51.980
Since I left my village, 
I've become a bit of a warrior.

1096
00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:52.980
Strong.

1097
00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:53.980
Brave.

1098
00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:54.980
Paul.

1099
00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:55.980
Paul.

1100
00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:56.980
Move it.

1101
00:58:56.980 --> 00:58:58.980
This way.

1102
00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:00.980
Get those pages up there.

1103
00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.980
Am I?

1104
00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:04.980
This looks bad.

1105
00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:05.980
Really bad.

1106
00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:06.980
Move it.

1107
00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:08.980
Am I?

1108
00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:17.980
Don't tell me you were actually
starting to become friends with that panda.

1109
00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.980
No, it's just when we want something,

1110
00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:23.980
we must use whatever is
at our disposal to get it.

1111
00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:25.980
That's all that panda was.

1112
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:27.980
Something to use.

1113
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:30.980
Is that why you took me in?

1114
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:33.980
So I could help
you get what you wanted?

1115
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.980
I took you in because you were clever

1116
00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.980
and ruthless and unsentimental like me.

1117
00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:43.980
And the day you stopped being
those things is the day when,

1118
00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.980
yes, you stopped being useful to me.

1119
00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:49.980
So for both of our sakes, don't change.

1120
00:59:55.980 --> 01:00:01.980
Tonight, when the blood moon rises to
its highest point in the night sky,

1121
01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:07.980
I will open the door to the spirit
realm and all of its secrets will be mine.

1122
01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:13.980
Does the blood moon always rises slowly?

1123
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:18.980
I seem to remember it rising faster.

1124
01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:20.980
No?

1125
01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:22.980
Just me?

1126
01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:29.980
It's just for dramatic effect anyway.

1127
01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:32.980
I think I'm just going
to open the spirit realm now.

1128
01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.980
I'm going to open the
door to the spirit realm now.

1129
01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.980
Bring me Tyrone!

1130
01:00:57.980 --> 01:00:59.980
Tyrone?

1131
01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.980
Big fan.

1132
01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:03.980
Who are you and what
are you doing with that staff?

1133
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:06.980
This was given to me
by an old friend of yours.

1134
01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:08.980
The puffy panda?

1135
01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:13.980
Poe might be an idiot, but he'd never willingly
hand over Oogway's staff to the likes of you.

1136
01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.980
Who said anything about willingly?

1137
01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:28.980
Apparently I misjudged you, Lizard.

1138
01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:31.980
Now, why have you brought me back?

1139
01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:35.980
I summoned you here so that you could
teach me your most legendary kung fu rules.

1140
01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:38.980
I don't share my skills with anyone.

1141
01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:40.980
There wasn't a request.

1142
01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:07.980
No!

1143
01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:32.980
Yes, I got it!

1144
01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.980
The Tylong Nerve Strike.

1145
01:02:34.980 --> 01:02:36.980
The power, the precision.

1146
01:02:39.980 --> 01:02:41.980
What have you done to me?

1147
01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:45.980
All of your kung fu is now mine.

1148
01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.980
And the best part is?

1149
01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.980
I'm just getting warmed up.

1150
01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.980
Bring me Tyrone Line!

1151
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.980
Please stop the spring.

1152
01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:00.980
Please.

1153
01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.980
Yes, sir.

1154
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:12.980
Oh, what do you mean?

1155
01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:13.980
Be reasonable!

1156
01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:15.980
I'm not going anywhere until
I get my staff back.

1157
01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:17.980
No staff is worth your life.

1158
01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:22.980
As long as I'm still the Dragon Warrior, 
I won't let anyone else get hurt because of me.

1159
01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:30.980
No!

1160
01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:40.980
Ho!

1161
01:03:40.980 --> 01:03:42.980
You're alive!

1162
01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:47.980
Please, I made a mistake.

1163
01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:48.980
So did I.

1164
01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:50.980
Trusting you.

1165
01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:52.980
I'm sorry.

1166
01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:54.980
Did your master tell
you to say that too?

1167
01:03:54.980 --> 01:03:55.980
She's not my master.

1168
01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:57.980
I'm leaving for good.

1169
01:03:57.980 --> 01:03:59.980
It's the truth.

1170
01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:01.980
I was wrong about everything.

1171
01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:05.980
What are you doing?

1172
01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:06.980
Stopping you.

1173
01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:08.980
Get out of my way, Zhen.

1174
01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:09.980
No.

1175
01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:11.980
Move.

1176
01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:12.980
You want me to move?

1177
01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:13.980
Move me.

1178
01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.980
First you betrayed me, and
now you're going to fight me?

1179
01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:20.980
Why are you doing this?

1180
01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:22.980
To stop you from getting killed.

1181
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.980
Stop it!

1182
01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:51.980
What do you care if
I get killed or not?

1183
01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:07.980
Please, Po. Just let
me do one thing right.

1184
01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:18.980
You're not the only one
who's made some bad choices lately.

1185
01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:22.980
You're really going to go
through with this, aren't you?

1186
01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:23.980
Afraid so.

1187
01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:26.980
And there's nothing I can do
to talk you out of it?

1188
01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:27.980
I'm afraid not.

1189
01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:29.980
You can't beat her, you know.

1190
01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:31.980
You're probably right.

1191
01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:34.980
But I have to try.

1192
01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.980
Get as far away from
this place as you can.

1193
01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:38.980
How?

1194
01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:40.980
We should never have let him come here.

1195
01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.980
We are such a terrible father.

1196
01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.980
At least you didn't lie and betray him.

1197
01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:45.980
Well, that's true.

1198
01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:46.980
You're worse.

1199
01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:48.980
I am a terrible friend.

1200
01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:49.980
Friend?

1201
01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.980
That feels a little generous.

1202
01:05:51.980 --> 01:05:53.980
Let's just give up, surrender.

1203
01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:55.980
We can't let him go in there alone.

1204
01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.980
What can we do?

1205
01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:59.980
They're just free of us against an army.

1206
01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.980
Then I guess we'll just have
to get an army of our own.

1207
01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:17.980
Hey, listen up, everybody!

1208
01:06:25.980 --> 01:06:26.980
Thank you.

1209
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.980
The dragon warrior is in trouble.

1210
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:30.980
Who?

1211
01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.980
You know, bow.

1212
01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.980
The panda.

1213
01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:39.980
Now, now, a different panda.

1214
01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:40.980
I'm his father.

1215
01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:41.980
I'm also his father.

1216
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.980
Okay, that doesn't matter.

1217
01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.980
What matters is that my friend's
in trouble and he needs my help.

1218
01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:48.980
So, I need yours.

1219
01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.980
Why should we help you?

1220
01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.980
Because...

1221
01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:53.980
Because...

1222
01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.980
It's the right thing to do.

1223
01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:00.980
Stop that!

1224
01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:01.980
Stop!

1225
01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:02.980
Stop laughing!

1226
01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.980
I know you think it might be
too late for a bunch of cheats,

1227
01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:11.980
thieves and cutthroats like
us to change our ways.

1228
01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:13.980
But a good friend once told me,

1229
01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:16.980
it's never too late
to do the right thing.

1230
01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:19.980
So, what you're saying is,
the more right we do now,

1231
01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:21.980
the more wrong we can do later.

1232
01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:22.980
What?

1233
01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:23.980
Now what?

1234
01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:25.980
And with the chameleon out of the way...

1235
01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:27.980
We can finally do
all the wrong we want.

1236
01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:29.980
I think you're missing a fundamental point.

1237
01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.980
Violet! Violet!

1238
01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:35.980
Are you guys ready to do
the right thing for the wrong reasons?

1239
01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:44.980
Now, you see the mistake this dragon
warrior fellow made was underestimating his opponent.

1240
01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.980
I never would have walked
into such an obvious trap.

1241
01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:48.980
Hey!

1242
01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.980
Now, you see the mistake
this dragon warrior fellow made was...

1243
01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.980
Shut up, Larry!

1244
01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:03.980
This place is crawling with
more guards than I've ever seen.

1245
01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:05.980
I'm never gonna get to Poe in time.

1246
01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:07.980
You just get to Poe. 
We'll take care of the guards.

1247
01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:08.980
We will?

1248
01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:10.980
I mean, we will.

1249
01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:11.980
But how?

1250
01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:13.980
Just leave that to me.

1251
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:20.980
The power of the demon warrior is here.

1252
01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.980
The power of the demon warrior is here.

1253
01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:25.980
Now, you see the mistake
this dragon warrior fellow made was...

1254
01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:27.980
I never would have
gone to Poe in time.

1255
01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:28.980
I'm sorry.

1256
01:08:28.980 --> 01:08:30.980
We can finally do the right thing.

1257
01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:33.980
Now, you see the mistake
this dragon warrior fellow made was...

1258
01:08:33.980 --> 01:08:34.980
We'll take the wrong thing.

1259
01:08:34.980 --> 01:08:35.980
What?

1260
01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:37.980
You said we can
finally do the right thing.

1261
01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:38.980
You are right.

1262
01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:39.980
But we will.

1263
01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:40.980
We will.

1264
01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:41.980
We will.

1265
01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.980
We will.

1266
01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:43.980
We will.

1267
01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:44.980
We will.

1268
01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:45.980
We will.

1269
01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:52.460
Kind. Lord Shed, those are
all my old nemesises, nemesis, nemesis?

1270
01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:57.500
The chameleon is pulling spirits from the spirit
realm and draining us of all our moves.

1271
01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.500
And she's using your staff to do it. 
I'm here to get it back.

1272
01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:06.860
I won't hold my breath. Um, 
I'm sorry, do I know you? Do you know me? It's Scott.

1273
01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.300
The fire-breathing crocodile?

1274
01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:15.660
Oh, right, Scott. 
Master Shifu and I were just talking about you.

1275
01:09:15.980 --> 01:09:21.260
And, uh, Oogway made a mistake
choosing you as the Dragon Warrior.

1276
01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:26.860
I just didn't realize how big
a mistake it was until now.

1277
01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:32.700
Whoa, Tailam? I'm gonna get that
staff back, restore your kung fu,

1278
01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:39.820
and return you all back to the spirit realm. You'll see. 
All I see is a broken promise.

1279
01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:50.540
All right. Thank you, bunch of cantankerous komodos. 
Now, this can go one of two ways.

1280
01:09:53.100 --> 01:10:00.860
The easy way in which you surrender willily,
or the hard way, where you surrender woundedly.

1281
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:03.020
The choice is yours.

1282
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:10.220
I'm just kidding! 
I'm just kidding!

1283
01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:26.220
Thanks, Pete.

1284
01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.020
Oh, it's too spicy.

1285
01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.020
No, it's got the perfect kick.

1286
01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:44.220
You can't send, and that's
the secret to my mulberry punch.

1287
01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.820
That candle was right.

1288
01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:03.820
That candle was right. 
More violence later is better.

1289
01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:13.820
I believe you have
something that belongs to me.

1290
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:19.820
Can't you even die right?

1291
01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.820
Can't you even kill wrong?

1292
01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.820
No. We're playing it and coming together.

1293
01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:25.820
Now, about that staff.

1294
01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:31.820
Take it. I already have
everything I need from it anyway.

1295
01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.820
I think this was destiny.

1296
01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:40.820
A final face off between familiar
adversaries alike in so many ways.

1297
01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:44.820
If only I had a dumpling for every time
a villain told me how much we had in common.

1298
01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:47.820
It's true. We've both risen
to the highest of heights.

1299
01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:50.820
It's a shame only one of
us can come out on top.

1300
01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.820
It is a shame for you.

1301
01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:58.820
My combined power of sorcery and
kung fu will make me unstoppable.

1302
01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:02.820
And once I dispense with you, 
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City to...

1303
01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:06.820
Every other city in town and village from
here to the valley of peace and beyond.

1304
01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:07.820
Yeah, I know.

1305
01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:09.820
But how did you know?

1306
01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:13.820
I saw it in a vision
because I'm the track and warrior.

1307
01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:16.820
For now, at least.

1308
01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:20.820
But I've realized that it's
probably time I made a change.

1309
01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:22.820
And so should you.

1310
01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.820
I'm the chameleon. 
I do nothing but change.

1311
01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.820
Only on the outside.

1312
01:12:27.820 --> 01:12:29.820
Real change happens from within.

1313
01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:32.820
And if we're really
as alike as you say,

1314
01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:37.820
then maybe we could both let go of who
we were and become something better than we already are.

1315
01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:38.820
What do you say?

1316
01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.820
I say...

1317
01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.820
Oh, I saw that coming.

1318
01:12:46.820 --> 01:12:48.820
We're very proud of you.

1319
01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:49.820
You tried it our way.

1320
01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:51.820
Now, try it yours.

1321
01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:53.820
Kick her butt!

1322
01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.820
I'm way ahead of you.

1323
01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:05.820
That's a hell of a strong twist!

1324
01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:11.820
That's the boys' tusks of terror!

1325
01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:14.820
That's the wolf's fangs of fury!

1326
01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:19.820
That's the wolf's fangs of fury!

1327
01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:21.820
That's the wolf's fangs of fury!

1328
01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:24.820
What?

1329
01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:26.820
Recognize this mode?

1330
01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:29.820
Is that how I sound?

1331
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.820
I don't sound like that, do I?

1332
01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:34.820
You didn't hurt no sales! 
I could just steal them!

1333
01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:35.820
I can't help you!

1334
01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:36.820
Give them a left.

1335
01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:37.820
All right, I'll put cut.

1336
01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.820
Which one are you rooting for?

1337
01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:39.820
I'm not sure.

1338
01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:40.820
This is all very confusing.

1339
01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:43.820
I'm stronger than every opponent you've ever faced.

1340
01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.820
It's because I am
every opponent you've ever faced.

1341
01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:03.820
Whoa, I gotta workshop those heroic entrances.

1342
01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.820
Nah, it was just wrecking.

1343
01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.820
I knew I shouldn't be after
the rotten and gutter while you belong.

1344
01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.820
Better to rotten the
gutter than under your thumb.

1345
01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:14.820
Okay.

1346
01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:22.820
Two against one?

1347
01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:25.820
Well, now that doesn't seem fair.

1348
01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:27.820
I'll have to even the odds.

1349
01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.820
Master Cobra!

1350
01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:32.820
Master Osprey!

1351
01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:34.820
Master Scorpion!

1352
01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.820
Master Wolf!

1353
01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:38.820
General Pye!

1354
01:14:38.820 --> 01:14:40.820
Lord Shek!

1355
01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:47.820
That is awesome!

1356
01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:51.820
I mean, it's disturbing, but it's awesome!

1357
01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:09.820
Whoa!

1358
01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:11.820
I'm sad!

1359
01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:15.820
I'm sad!

1360
01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:17.820
I'm sad!

1361
01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:19.820
I'm sad!

1362
01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:21.820
I'm sad!

1363
01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:23.820
I'm sad!

1364
01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.820
I'm sad!

1365
01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:27.820
I'm sad!

1366
01:15:27.820 --> 01:15:29.820
I'm sad!

1367
01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:31.820
I'm sad!

1368
01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:33.820
I'm sad!

1369
01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.820
I'm sad!

1370
01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:37.820
I'm sad!

1371
01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:40.820
I'm sad!

1372
01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:42.820
Help!

1373
01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:47.820
Help!

1374
01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.820
I thought we were friends.

1375
01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.820
Stand back!

1376
01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:01.820
I'm gonna kick my butt!

1377
01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:12.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1378
01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:14.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1379
01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1380
01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1381
01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:20.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1382
01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:22.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1383
01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1384
01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:26.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1385
01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1386
01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1387
01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1388
01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1389
01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1390
01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1391
01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:40.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1392
01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:42.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1393
01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:44.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1394
01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:46.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1395
01:16:46.820 --> 01:16:48.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1396
01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1397
01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:52.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1398
01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:54.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1399
01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:56.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1400
01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:58.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1401
01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1402
01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:04.820
I'm gonna kick your butt!

1403
01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:24.820
Come on, Po! Get out of there!

1404
01:17:24.820 --> 01:17:26.820
You have to do this!

1405
01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:28.820
I can't beat the Communion!

1406
01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:30.820
A wise old tortoise once told me that you
never know what you can do until you do it!

1407
01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:34.820
The world hangs in the balance, and you're
here to give me life advice from a Tornist!

1408
01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:38.820
Be the pit, Jen. Be the pit.

1409
01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:50.820
And what do you think you're doing?

1410
01:17:50.820 --> 01:17:51.820
Finishing what Poe started.

1411
01:17:51.820 --> 01:17:54.820
Oh, please. How many times
do I have to tell you?

1412
01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:58.820
Don't slouch!

1413
01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:09.820
You unfraithful little person!

1414
01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:13.820
After all I've done for you,
you betrayed me for the panda!

1415
01:18:14.820 --> 01:18:18.820
You're as full as sheets. 
Never trust anyone.

1416
01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:21.820
Ha! You can't defeat me. 
I know all your moves.

1417
01:18:21.820 --> 01:18:23.820
Not this one.

1418
01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:24.820
Roll.

1419
01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:29.820
I have stirred, served, and stuck glass!

1420
01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:40.820
Second move? Someone always gets hurt.

1421
01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.820
Now that's a cool move.

1422
01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:46.820
Poe, you could have gotten out of
that cage anytime you wanted. You faker!

1423
01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:48.820
It's not faking, it's method.

1424
01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:53.820
Besides, how's a peach pit ever supposed to become a
tree if you never give it the chance to grow?

1425
01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:58.820
And hey, you stirred faster and rolled higher.

1426
01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:01.820
But for the last time, the word is...

1427
01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:07.820
It's you!

1428
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.820
Institution.

1429
01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:34.820
Maybe Poe was right about you.

1430
01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:43.820
You aren't completely useless after all.

1431
01:19:43.820 --> 01:19:45.820
Oh my gosh, thank you so much.

1432
01:19:55.820 --> 01:20:00.820
Ha ha ha! That's
my son! I'm your son!

1433
01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:05.820
I think it's time
you set this home, panda.

1434
01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:30.820
Gen! Do something!

1435
01:20:30.820 --> 01:20:37.820
Third move. No one's interested in your feelings.

1436
01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:41.820
See you on the other side.

1437
01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:43.820
Dragon Warrior.

1438
01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.820
No one's interested in your feelings.

1439
01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:52.820
See you on the other side.

1440
01:20:52.820 --> 01:20:54.820
Dragon Warrior.

1441
01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:17.820
We packed some food
for your time in jail.

1442
01:21:17.820 --> 01:21:20.820
Let's hope it's not your final meal.

1443
01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:22.820
Thanks, guys.

1444
01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:27.820
I was thinking, after I serve my
time and I'm a free fox again,

1445
01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:30.820
maybe I'll open one of those
acupuncture places that are all the rage.

1446
01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:35.820
I think you'd better sit in for a
job with a little more room for growth.

1447
01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.820
Jane Palace.

1448
01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:47.820
Out of all the candidates you
choose to train as your worthy successor,

1449
01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.820
you chose the fox?

1450
01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:51.820
You know when you know, you know?

1451
01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:54.820
Fine, choose who you want,
the thief, the stick, the carrot,

1452
01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:56.820
I don't even know why I bothered.

1453
01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:57.820
I'm going to go meditate.

1454
01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:59.820
A what?

1455
01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:03.820
Don't worry, he'll come around.

1456
01:22:03.820 --> 01:22:05.820
Probably.

1457
01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.820
Maybe.

1458
01:22:07.820 --> 01:22:10.820
Hey, you okay?

1459
01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:14.820
He's right. What about me
says I'm ready for this?

1460
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:17.820
Well, as I learned from
working in my dad's kitchen,

1461
01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:21.820
sometimes the greatest dishes come
from the most unlikely ingredients.

1462
01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:23.820
Hey, that's not bad.

1463
01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:25.820
Okay, I see you, spiritual leader.

1464
01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:28.820
Yeah, I'm getting a
hang of this proper thing.

1465
01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:31.820
One shouldn't do a deep squat
with a chopstick in one's pocket.

1466
01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.820
You know, maybe you should
just stick to kicking mine.

1467
01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:35.820
Money can't buy happiness.

1468
01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:37.820
But it sure can
buy a lot of dumplings.

1469
01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:39.820
Why doesn't it always come
back to dumplings with you?

1470
01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:41.820
When life gives you lemons,

1471
01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:44.820
make pear juice and blow everyone's minds.

1472
01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:45.820
We get it.

1473
01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:48.820
You can't have your
mooncake and eat it too.

1474
01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:50.820
Although I guess you could have mooncake

1475
01:22:50.820 --> 01:22:52.820
and then order mango pudding on the side.

1476
01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.820
Can we just start the training now?

1477
01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.820
Inner peace.

1478
01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:00.820
Inner peace.

1479
01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:02.820
Inner peace.

1480
01:23:02.820 --> 01:23:03.820
Hey, Master, see food.

1481
01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:04.820
Look, there's two of us.

1482
01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:05.820
And don't break sheep.

1483
01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:06.820
We're not breathing with your belly.

1484
01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:09.820
Are you just okay?

1485
01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.820
Inner peace.

1486
01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:21.820
Inner peace.

1487
01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.820
Inner peace.

1488
01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:35.820
Are you ready to begin your training?

1489
01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.820
Are you?

1490
01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:38.820
Yes.

1491
01:23:38.820 --> 01:23:40.820
And I brought a little help.

1492
01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.820
Inner peace.

1493
01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:09.820
Inner peace.

1494
01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:29.820
Inner peace.

1495
01:24:35.820 --> 01:24:37.820
Inner peace.

1496
01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:43.820
Inner peace.

1497
01:24:43.820 --> 01:24:45.820
Inner peace.

1498
01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:47.820
Inner peace.

1499
01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:49.820
Inner peace.

1500
01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:51.820
Inner peace.

1501
01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:53.820
Inner peace.

1502
01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:55.820
Inner peace.

1503
01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:57.820
Inner peace.

1504
01:24:57.820 --> 01:24:59.820
Inner peace.

1505
01:24:59.820 --> 01:25:01.820
Inner peace.

1506
01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:03.820
Inner peace.

1507
01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:05.820
Inner peace.

1508
01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:07.820
Inner peace.

1509
01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:09.820
Inner peace.

1510
01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:15.820
Inner peace.

1511
01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.820
Inner peace.

1512
01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:22.820
Inner peace.

1513
01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:25.820
Inner peace.

1514
01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.820
Inner peace.

1515
01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:29.820
Inner peace.

1516
01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.820
Inner peace.

1517
01:25:31.820 --> 01:25:33.820
And I want more pain

1518
01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:38.820
And I've never got the
heart for what I am

1519
01:25:38.820 --> 01:25:40.820
Oh, baby, baby

1520
01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:44.820
I want to know what you know

1521
01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:47.820
And so do I

1522
01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:50.820
Oh, baby, baby

1523
01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:52.820
I love you, baby

1524
01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:55.820
I love you, baby

1525
01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:58.820
I love you, baby

1526
01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.820
I love you, baby
