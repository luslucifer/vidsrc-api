Of an African slave woman
called Eve.

In return for his life,
he freed her

And gave her this piece
of land by the bayou.

Perhaps in gratitude,
she bore him 16 children.

We are the descendants
of Eve and Jean Paul Batiste.

I know you know.

170
00:11:53.457 --> 00:11:54.958
You love mama?

171
00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:01.031
Your mama...

172
00:12:01.099 --> 00:12:03.466
Is the most
beautiful...


173
00:12:03.534 --> 00:12:06.503
Perfect woman
I ever met.


174
00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:09.673
Your mama's a lady,

175
00:12:09.741 --> 00:12:12.909
And I'll always
love her.


176
00:12:12.977 --> 00:12:14.778
Always.

177
00:12:14.846 --> 00:12:16.246
You understand?

178
00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:21.985
Daddy.

179
00:12:25.657 --> 00:12:27.190
Yes, baby?

180
00:12:30.061 --> 00:12:32.295
How come you never
dance with me?


181
00:12:34.265 --> 00:12:35.866
Baby, how can you say

182
00:12:35.933 --> 00:12:37.868
Your daddy never dances
with you?


183
00:12:37.935 --> 00:12:40.503
When we're alone
and stuff,


184
00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:42.338
But not at parties.

185
00:12:42.406 --> 00:12:43.940
You always dance
with Cisely.


186
00:12:46.144 --> 00:12:48.244
Tell you what,

187
00:12:48.312 --> 00:12:49.746
From now on,

188
00:12:49.814 --> 00:12:52.415
We'll dance
at every party.


189
00:12:52.483 --> 00:12:53.717
All right?

190
00:13:00.024 --> 00:13:01.858
Heh heh heh.

191
00:13:01.926 --> 00:13:03.927
Mmm.

192
00:13:03.995 --> 00:13:04.861
[door closes]

193
00:13:06.363 --> 00:13:07.931
Roz: There you are.

194
00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:09.933
I was looking for you two.

195
00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:13.369
Eve...

196
00:13:13.437 --> 00:13:14.938
It is past midnight.

197
00:13:15.006 --> 00:13:18.341
Your cohorts
are already in pajamas.


198
00:13:18.409 --> 00:13:20.043
I was talking
to daddy.


199
00:13:22.413 --> 00:13:23.947
Well, I guess
that's legal.


200
00:13:26.317 --> 00:13:27.851
Hey, you...

201
00:13:31.923 --> 00:13:32.889
Are you sober?

202
00:13:34.092 --> 00:13:35.592
Yes, ma'am.

203
00:13:35.659 --> 00:13:37.527
Heh. Just barely.

204
00:13:42.867 --> 00:13:44.434
You have fun tonight?

205
00:13:45.903 --> 00:13:47.104
I bet you did.

206
00:13:48.372 --> 00:13:49.973
Well, go straight to bed

207
00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:52.209
And don't forget
to say your prayers.


208
00:13:52.276 --> 00:13:53.210
Never...

209
00:13:53.277 --> 00:13:56.046
Both: ...Cheat
the man upstairs.


210
00:13:59.817 --> 00:14:00.683
Ok.

211
00:14:03.087 --> 00:14:04.354
Good night, mama.
Good night, daddy.


212
00:14:04.421 --> 00:14:05.455
Good night, baby.

213
00:14:07.024 --> 00:14:08.892
Night-night.

214
00:14:12.063 --> 00:14:13.363
What's wrong with her?

215
00:14:15.566 --> 00:14:18.835
Oh, she'll be all right.

216
00:14:18.903 --> 00:14:20.603
And what about you?

217
00:14:20.671 --> 00:14:23.206
What about me?

218
00:14:25.243 --> 00:14:26.309
You sober?

219
00:14:27.645 --> 00:14:29.445
Barely.

220
00:14:35.419 --> 00:14:37.520
You coming in?

221
00:14:37.588 --> 00:14:38.588
In a minute.

222
00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:03.313
Hey.

223
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:05.182
[sniffling]

224
00:15:05.249 --> 00:15:06.983
Where were you?

225
00:15:07.051 --> 00:15:08.251
I looked all over.

226
00:15:10.822 --> 00:15:12.355
I was outside
with daddy.


227
00:15:13.691 --> 00:15:15.125
Before that.

228
00:15:15.193 --> 00:15:17.060
I was in
the carriage house.


229
00:15:20.064 --> 00:15:22.299
Well, you was in there
a long time.


230
00:15:28.439 --> 00:15:31.174
[softly sobbing]

231
00:15:31.242 --> 00:15:33.076
I fell asleep.

232
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.180
What's wrong, rabbit?

233
00:15:39.283 --> 00:15:40.550
What's the matter? What?

234
00:15:40.617 --> 00:15:42.052
What is it?

235
00:15:42.119 --> 00:15:43.720
Nothing.

236
00:15:43.787 --> 00:15:45.722
Hey, don't tell me
it's nothing.


237
00:15:45.789 --> 00:15:47.490
What's wrong?

238
00:15:49.393 --> 00:15:50.894
I saw daddy.

239
00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:57.367
I was asleep...

240
00:15:57.434 --> 00:15:59.435
And I woke up...

241
00:15:59.503 --> 00:16:02.072
And...

242
00:16:02.139 --> 00:16:03.139
Daddy...

243
00:16:03.207 --> 00:16:04.407
What?

244
00:16:04.475 --> 00:16:06.409
Daddy and Mrs. Mereaux.

245
00:16:09.313 --> 00:16:11.547
What about daddy
and Mrs. Mereaux?


246
00:16:13.817 --> 00:16:15.618
I saw them kissing.

247
00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:17.420
Don't be stupid.

248
00:16:17.488 --> 00:16:19.589
Daddy wouldn't touch
that cow.


249
00:16:19.656 --> 00:16:21.291
It's true. I saw them.

250
00:16:21.359 --> 00:16:22.959
He had his hands on her.

251
00:16:23.027 --> 00:16:24.627
It's true.

252
00:16:24.695 --> 00:16:27.097
He was all up against her,
and her dress was--


253
00:16:27.164 --> 00:16:28.731
That's a lie!

254
00:16:28.799 --> 00:16:30.367
I saw them!

255
00:16:30.434 --> 00:16:32.369
He was all up
against her,


256
00:16:32.436 --> 00:16:35.038
And her dress was all up,
and they were rubbing!


257
00:16:35.106 --> 00:16:36.039
Shh!

258
00:16:36.107 --> 00:16:38.474
Shh!

259
00:16:38.542 --> 00:16:39.675
Stop it.

260
00:16:40.811 --> 00:16:42.245
Just stop it.

261
00:16:45.449 --> 00:16:47.550
I'm gonna tell you
what happened.


262
00:16:54.792 --> 00:16:55.725
What?

263
00:16:55.793 --> 00:16:57.394
I can't see a thing.

264
00:16:57.461 --> 00:17:00.263
You don't need to see.
Just hold my hand, sugar.


265
00:17:02.333 --> 00:17:05.468
Cisely: They came in
to get some more wine.


266
00:17:08.005 --> 00:17:11.007
And daddy told her a joke,

267
00:17:11.075 --> 00:17:13.576
And she fell against him
laughing.


268
00:17:15.746 --> 00:17:16.846
And they woke you up.

269
00:17:16.914 --> 00:17:18.381
[clatter]

270
00:17:21.518 --> 00:17:22.718
You sure?

271
00:17:24.621 --> 00:17:26.022
I'm certain.

272
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:28.024
I mean, what would
daddy want


273
00:17:28.092 --> 00:17:30.226
With Matty Mereaux?

274
00:17:30.294 --> 00:17:31.894
Mama's the most
beautiful woman


275
00:17:31.963 --> 00:17:33.463
In the whole world.

276
00:17:35.699 --> 00:17:36.899
You go to bed.

277
00:17:39.636 --> 00:17:40.503
It's late.

278
00:17:44.808 --> 00:17:46.076
You scared me.

279
00:17:51.748 --> 00:17:53.767
Louis: God damn it,
Harry, wait a minute.


280
00:17:53.835 --> 00:17:55.435
Harry: I'm leaving,
I'm driving,


281
00:17:55.503 --> 00:17:57.738
And I'm taking
my damn wife with me.

Now, you're either gonna
let Mozelle drive,


285
00:18:01.942 --> 00:18:03.810
Or y'all gonna
stay here tonight.

Oh, Harry!

293
00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:16.523
Break it up!
All right!

Now--now--now what your

Nigger, just 'cause
you a doctor,

301

Stop it. It's late.

302
00:18:32.139 --> 00:18:33.540
You wanna raise
the dead?


303
00:18:33.608 --> 00:18:34.875
Cisely,
go back to bed.


304

You're not dressed,
and it's bedtime.

00:31:58.845 --> 00:31:59.978
Mrs. Hobbs?

502
00:32:00.046 --> 00:32:03.148
Well, some illnesses are
hard to put a finger on.


503
00:32:03.217 --> 00:32:04.584
Is she having a baby?

504
00:32:04.651 --> 00:32:07.286
No. Why you ask?

505
00:32:07.354 --> 00:32:10.323
You ever want other kids?

506
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:12.458
No. Your mama and I
are perfectly happy


507
00:32:12.526 --> 00:32:13.626
With the 3 kids
we got.


508
00:32:13.694 --> 00:32:16.095
No, I mean other kids.

509
00:32:16.162 --> 00:32:18.264
Besides us.

510
00:32:27.541 --> 00:32:29.508
Open your mouth
and say "ahh."


511
00:32:29.576 --> 00:32:31.644
Ahh...

512
00:32:32.812 --> 00:32:35.013
No, I don't see
anything in there


513
00:32:35.081 --> 00:32:37.816
That would make you
say something so stupid.


514
00:32:37.884 --> 00:32:40.152
I got to go
to the hospital.


515
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:41.354
I have to take you home.

516
00:32:41.421 --> 00:32:44.857
Oh, no. Please, daddy?

517
00:32:46.025 --> 00:32:46.959
Tell you what.

518
00:32:47.026 --> 00:32:48.294
I'll race you.

519
00:32:48.362 --> 00:32:49.395
Give you
a head start.


520
00:32:49.463 --> 00:32:50.946
Ok. Bye.

[whistling]

522
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:15.154
We're supposed to be
cheering each other up.


523
00:33:15.221 --> 00:33:16.889
[sighs]

524
00:33:16.956 --> 00:33:19.091
I know.

525
00:33:23.229 --> 00:33:26.965
I was just wondering what
happened with that woman.


526
00:33:29.303 --> 00:33:32.538
I suppose he fixed it.

527
00:33:32.606 --> 00:33:34.973
He knows how
to fix things.


528
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:38.277
When I first met Louis,

529
00:33:38.345 --> 00:33:39.912
I watched him set
this boy's leg


530
00:33:39.979 --> 00:33:41.947
Who had fallen
out of a tree.


531
00:33:42.015 --> 00:33:43.949
And I said to myself,

532
00:33:44.017 --> 00:33:46.419
Here's a man who can
fix things.


533
00:33:46.486 --> 00:33:50.456
He's a healer.
He'll take care of me.


534
00:33:54.594 --> 00:33:57.896
So I leave my family...

535
00:33:57.964 --> 00:34:02.802
And I move
to this swamp...


536
00:34:02.869 --> 00:34:06.739
And I find out
he's just a man.


537
00:34:12.646 --> 00:34:15.914
We're two of a kind,
my brother and I.


538
00:34:18.985 --> 00:34:21.620
One day
he'll turn around...


539
00:34:21.688 --> 00:34:26.091
And he will see you
for the first time.


540
00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:27.626
And then he'll
stop looking


541
00:34:27.694 --> 00:34:29.595
For what
he already has.


542
00:34:32.532 --> 00:34:34.099
What if it's too late?

543
00:34:37.103 --> 00:34:40.373
Let's eat
pomegranates...


544

Till our hands
turn red and...


545
00:34:43.477 --> 00:34:44.977
And all we can
think about


546
00:34:45.044 --> 00:34:46.846
Is getting
the juice off.

our fortunes told.

Not by her.

552
00:35:05.815 --> 00:35:06.949
Come on, now.

553
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:08.750
You said you wanted
to cheer me up. Come on.

Roz, that woman couldn't
predict heat in August.

Mozelle Batiste...

If I didn't know you
better, I'd say you had

A case of professional
jealousy.

Roz, I am
a psychic counselor.

nothing to be afraid of.

Come on.

Which one first?

Well...

564
00:35:32.341 --> 00:35:35.744
My--my sister-in-law is
something of a skeptic.


565
00:35:35.812 --> 00:35:38.781
But I'd very much
like my fortune told.

Sit down.

567
00:35:52.262 --> 00:35:53.813
Empty it.

You're in pain,
my daughter.

Yes.

There is an end
to your problem...

Though not one
you imagined.

Stay quiet.

And wait.

Wait?

00:41:15.551 --> 00:41:16.851
Nothing ever happens
behind your back.


666
00:41:16.919 --> 00:41:19.354
Don't talk back
to your mother, young lady!


667
00:41:19.422 --> 00:41:21.423
You're not too big
to beat.


668
00:41:21.491 --> 00:41:22.790
Don't threaten
my daughter, mama.


669
00:41:22.858 --> 00:41:24.325
You let her threaten me.

670
00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:30.415
When I was growing up,
children did not participate


671
00:41:30.483 --> 00:41:32.384
In the conversation
of adults.


672
00:41:33.686 --> 00:41:35.154
You can let them kids

673
00:41:35.221 --> 00:41:36.889
Back-talk and run wild
if you want to.


674
00:41:36.956 --> 00:41:38.773
You won't hear
another word out of me.


675
00:41:40.276 --> 00:41:41.510
In my day,

676
00:41:41.577 --> 00:41:45.147
We were thankful
for signs and warnings.


677
00:41:45.214 --> 00:41:47.416
Go on and let
the little hooligans


678
00:41:47.483 --> 00:41:48.400
Get runned over.

679
00:41:48.467 --> 00:41:51.336
<i>Ca va plus tranquille</i>
<i>autour d'ici.</i>


680
00:41:51.404 --> 00:41:53.839
It will be much quieter
around here.


681
00:41:59.712 --> 00:42:01.079
I want to thank you all

682
00:42:01.147 --> 00:42:02.714
For the delightful
family chat.


683
00:42:02.782 --> 00:42:04.449
I have patients to see.

684
00:42:04.517 --> 00:42:05.650
Louis...

685
00:42:05.718 --> 00:42:08.187
It's Sunday.

686
00:42:08.254 --> 00:42:09.988
When you find
a way to put sickness


687
00:42:10.056 --> 00:42:11.824
On a 8-hour, 5-day schedule,
you let me know.


688
00:42:11.891 --> 00:42:13.425
Well, what's wrong with them
they can't wait a day?


689
00:42:13.492 --> 00:42:16.094
Are you two
going to fight?


690
00:42:16.162 --> 00:42:19.664
Some sickness is hard
to put a finger on.


691
00:42:23.803 --> 00:42:26.171
I'll be back
soon as I can.


692
00:42:29.242 --> 00:42:32.044
Which one of your patients
you going to see, Louis?


693
00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:36.949
Woman, go get your palm read
and let me do my work.


694
00:42:50.813 --> 00:42:52.213
You love your daddy,
baby?


695
00:42:52.281 --> 00:42:53.582
You know I do.

696
00:42:53.649 --> 00:42:55.316
That's all I need.

697
00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:05.560
Excuse me, darling.

698
00:43:08.898 --> 00:43:10.966
Don't you think you're
being a little immature?


699
00:43:13.803 --> 00:43:15.937
I beg your pardon?

700
00:43:16.005 --> 00:43:17.939
Keeping us in the house

701
00:43:18.007 --> 00:43:19.641
'cause aunt Mozelle‚Äôs
seeing things


702
00:43:19.709 --> 00:43:22.210
And not wanting daddy
to go to work.


703
00:43:22.277 --> 00:43:24.278
What's wrong with you?

704
00:43:34.123 --> 00:43:35.390
If you're lucky,

705
00:43:35.458 --> 00:43:37.359
You might live long
enough to one day have


706
00:43:37.426 --> 00:43:39.027
A husband and children
of your own,


707
00:43:39.094 --> 00:43:41.429
But until then,
this is my house,


708
00:43:41.497 --> 00:43:42.464
And you will do
as I say.


709
00:43:42.532 --> 00:43:43.465
Do you understand?

710
00:43:44.833 --> 00:43:47.752
I said,
do you understand?


711
00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.721
Yes, ma'am.

712
00:43:52.691 --> 00:43:53.558
Good.

713
00:43:58.314 --> 00:44:01.916
No one leaves this house
until I say so.


714
00:44:20.219 --> 00:44:21.653
What man art thou,

715
00:44:21.721 --> 00:44:23.789
That thus bescreen'd
in night,


716
00:44:23.856 --> 00:44:26.090
So stumblest
on my counsel?


717
00:44:26.158 --> 00:44:27.526
By a name...

718
00:44:27.593 --> 00:44:30.729
I know not how
to tell thee who I am.


719
00:44:30.797 --> 00:44:33.832
My ring says that
I am king myself...


720
00:44:52.585 --> 00:44:54.319
[sighs]

721
00:45:03.529 --> 00:45:06.130
[sighs]

722
00:45:11.337 --> 00:45:13.405
What are you doing
in there?!


723
00:45:13.473 --> 00:45:15.874
Cisely: Go away!

724
00:45:58.785 --> 00:46:00.452
Aah!

725
00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.888
Ouch!

726
00:46:02.955 --> 00:46:04.890
God damn it.

727
00:46:04.957 --> 00:46:06.525
<i>Ferme to guele, hein!</i>

728
00:46:06.592 --> 00:46:07.992
Eve: I heard you.

729
00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.994
You said
"God damn it."


730
00:46:10.062 --> 00:46:11.329
Eve.

731
00:46:11.397 --> 00:46:13.498
You shouldn't be
sneaking up on people


732
00:46:13.566 --> 00:46:14.933
When they're swearing
to themselves.


733
00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.435
Does it hurt?

734
00:46:16.502 --> 00:46:17.636
What?

735
00:46:17.703 --> 00:46:19.170
Your finger, mother.

736
00:46:19.238 --> 00:46:23.341
Oh. No, not too much.

737
00:46:23.409 --> 00:46:25.276
You're gonna cut your finger
off one of these days.


738
00:46:25.344 --> 00:46:28.179
'tis not so deep
as a well,


739
00:46:28.247 --> 00:46:30.615
Nor so wide
as a church door,


740
00:46:30.683 --> 00:46:34.419
But 'tis enough,
'twill serve.


741
00:46:38.524 --> 00:46:40.024
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

742
00:46:40.092 --> 00:46:41.292
[chopping]

743
00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.293
What?

744
00:46:42.361 --> 00:46:44.629
We read most
of the tragedies.


745
00:46:44.697 --> 00:46:47.131
We're starting on
the goddamn comedies.


746
00:46:47.199 --> 00:46:49.734
You are asking
to get hit.


747
00:46:49.802 --> 00:46:50.735
[Poe screaming]

748
00:46:50.803 --> 00:46:51.736
Baby!

749
00:46:51.804 --> 00:46:52.804
[Poe screaming]

750
00:46:52.872 --> 00:46:54.172
Lord have mercy.

751
00:46:54.239 --> 00:46:56.074
[Poe screaming]

752
00:46:56.141 --> 00:46:58.309
What happened, baby?

753
00:46:58.377 --> 00:46:59.344
You all right?

754
00:46:59.411 --> 00:47:01.680
Poe: Mama!

755
00:47:01.747 --> 00:47:02.647
Mama, where are you?!

756
00:47:02.715 --> 00:47:03.648
Hey, mo.

757
00:47:03.716 --> 00:47:05.383
Poe, are you all right?

758
00:47:05.451 --> 00:47:07.051
Look what I found
in the attic.


759
00:47:07.119 --> 00:47:09.588
A monopoly board
and Chinese checkers.


760
00:47:09.655 --> 00:47:10.856
Girl, you could find
the czar of Russia


761
00:47:10.923 --> 00:47:11.857
In that attic.

762
00:47:11.924 --> 00:47:13.992
I despise
Chinese checkers.


763
00:47:14.059 --> 00:47:15.494
Poe: I hate her!
I hate her!


764
00:47:15.561 --> 00:47:17.996
I wish she was dead!

765
00:47:18.063 --> 00:47:21.299
I feel like I walked into
the middle of a cyclone.


766
00:47:21.367 --> 00:47:24.002
Eve, what did you do
to your brother?


767
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:25.670
I'm going to push him
out of a window


768
00:47:25.738 --> 00:47:27.138
If I don't get
out of this house.


769
00:47:27.206 --> 00:47:28.139
Eve!

770
00:47:28.207 --> 00:47:30.308
Cisely's been
in the goddamn bathtub


771
00:47:30.376 --> 00:47:32.744
For an hour,
you know that?


772
00:47:32.812 --> 00:47:34.980
She stayed in there

773
00:47:35.047 --> 00:47:36.347
Fortunately there's
more than one bathroom


774
00:47:36.415 --> 00:47:37.348
In this house.

775
00:47:37.416 --> 00:47:40.318
Ain't that much dirt
in all Louisiana.


776
00:47:40.386 --> 00:47:42.621
Get out
of the damn tub!


777
00:47:42.688 --> 00:47:44.556
You watch your
language, young lady.


778
00:47:44.624 --> 00:47:47.225
Mama keeps stabbing herself
in the kitchen.


779
00:47:47.292 --> 00:47:49.260
Show her your hands, mama.

780
00:47:49.328 --> 00:47:50.729
I think you better hush.

781
00:47:50.796 --> 00:47:52.230
And where's daddy?

782
00:47:52.297 --> 00:47:53.732
He's never home.

783
00:47:53.799 --> 00:47:55.700
He's supposed
to be home sometimes!


784
00:47:55.768 --> 00:47:57.769
Listen,
you little ingrate...


785
00:47:57.837 --> 00:47:59.571
Your father works hard

786
00:47:59.639 --> 00:48:01.573
So we can have a house
with 4 bathrooms.


787
00:48:01.641 --> 00:48:03.274
Not every night,
he's not working!


788
00:48:03.342 --> 00:48:04.208
I know he's not!

789
00:48:07.446 --> 00:48:09.113
I-
-I mean...

790
00:48:09.181 --> 00:48:11.883
Let me borrow you
for a minute.


791
00:48:16.856 --> 00:48:18.189
Poe?

792
00:48:21.794 --> 00:48:24.296
Is that your idea of being
a good daughter?


793
00:48:24.363 --> 00:48:25.830
It's true.

794
00:48:25.898 --> 00:48:27.232
He never comes home,

795
00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:29.000
And it's making her
nervous.


796
00:48:29.068 --> 00:48:31.269
She cuts herself.

797
00:48:31.337 --> 00:48:32.671
Oh, and you're
just being helpful


798
00:48:32.738 --> 00:48:34.573
Bringing it up,
is that it?


799
00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.574
She's nervous

800
00:48:35.641 --> 00:48:38.210
'cause he's messing
with other women.


801
00:48:38.277 --> 00:48:41.213
What did you say?

802
00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:43.315
Nothing.

803
00:48:43.382 --> 00:48:44.816
Play games with me,

804
00:48:44.883 --> 00:48:46.484
I swear,
I'll slap you blind.


805
00:48:46.552 --> 00:48:48.420
It's true. I saw them.

806
00:48:48.487 --> 00:48:50.121
You saw who?

807
00:48:52.157 --> 00:48:53.658
You have 5 seconds!

808
00:48:53.726 --> 00:48:55.793
Daddy and Mrs. Mereaux.

809
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:58.963
God.

810
00:48:59.031 --> 00:49:01.700
It was at the party.

811
00:49:01.767 --> 00:49:03.134
I was out
in the carriage house,


812
00:49:03.202 --> 00:49:04.802
And they didn't see me.

813
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.938
And it was worse
than just kissing.


814
00:49:07.005 --> 00:49:07.939
They were--

815
00:49:08.006 --> 00:49:10.308
Hush! Hush!
Let me think a minute.


816
00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:16.114
Have you told anyone?

817
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:18.983
No.

818
00:49:19.051 --> 00:49:20.318
Well, that's good.

819
00:49:20.386 --> 00:49:23.988
Because if you tell anyone,
anyone at all,


820
00:49:24.056 --> 00:49:26.124
I'm going to kill you.

821
00:49:26.191 --> 00:49:29.427
And if you get careless again
with your mama's feelings,


822
00:49:29.495 --> 00:49:32.564
I swear, I'll do you harm.

823
00:49:32.632 --> 00:49:34.132
You understand me?

824
00:49:34.199 --> 00:49:35.700
Yes, ma'am.

825
00:49:38.471 --> 00:49:40.505
Listen to me...

826
00:49:40.573 --> 00:49:42.974
Your daddy loves you.

827
00:49:43.041 --> 00:49:45.477
And he loves your mama.

828
00:49:45.544 --> 00:49:46.745
I know.

829
00:49:53.986 --> 00:49:58.323
We are a lot the same,
your father and I.


830
00:49:58.391 --> 00:50:00.659
[laughs]

831
00:50:00.726 --> 00:50:05.096
Except I don't have
no children to catch me.


832
00:50:05.164 --> 00:50:08.433
Y'all are my children.

833
00:50:12.672 --> 00:50:15.106
That's why Maynard
got tired of me,


834
00:50:15.174 --> 00:50:17.842
'cause I'm barren.

835
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:20.312
But...

836
00:50:20.379 --> 00:50:22.213
Maynard loved you.

837
00:50:22.281 --> 00:50:25.116
Maynard loved you
most of all.


838
00:50:25.184 --> 00:50:27.485
I think he did,

839
00:50:27.553 --> 00:50:30.789
But I didn't know that
until I met Hosea.


840
00:50:30.856 --> 00:50:32.824
Tell me about Hosea.

841
00:50:32.891 --> 00:50:35.527
You're too young
to understand.


842
00:50:37.863 --> 00:50:39.197
But when I was with Hosea,

843
00:50:39.264 --> 00:50:42.434
It was like my whole body
was burning.


844
00:50:42.501 --> 00:50:43.935
I'd come home,

845
00:50:44.002 --> 00:50:49.140
I'd have to rub ice on my face
and neck to cool down.


846
00:50:49.208 --> 00:50:53.745
If Maynard knew,
he never said a word.


847
00:50:53.813 --> 00:50:56.914
And then one night,
Hosea showed up at the door.


848
00:50:56.982 --> 00:50:59.150
He said,
"pack your bags, woman.


849
00:50:59.218 --> 00:51:00.618
I've come
to take you with me."


850
00:51:00.686 --> 00:51:03.555
And God help me...

851
00:51:03.622 --> 00:51:06.391
I pushed past
my startled husband.


852
00:51:06.459 --> 00:51:08.460
I was going upstairs
to pack my bags,


853
00:51:08.527 --> 00:51:10.462
When I heard
Maynard say,


854
00:51:10.529 --> 00:51:14.198
In a tone I'd never
heard him use,


855
00:51:14.266 --> 00:51:16.167
"I don't care
who you are, sir,


856
00:51:16.235 --> 00:51:19.571
"but if you don't leave
my house at once,


857
00:51:19.638 --> 00:51:20.938
I will hurt you."

858
00:51:21.006 --> 00:51:23.375
And I turned just in time

859
00:51:23.442 --> 00:51:27.445
To see Hosea pull the gun out
and aim it at Maynard.


860
00:51:29.482 --> 00:51:31.983
"I'm in love
with your wife,


861
00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:33.385
"and if you try
to stop us,


862
00:51:33.452 --> 00:51:35.720
I'll kill you."

863
00:51:35.788 --> 00:51:38.556
Maynard walked right up

864
00:51:38.624 --> 00:51:42.394
And pushed his chest
in the barrel of that gun,


865
00:51:42.461 --> 00:51:45.263
And he said,

866
00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:47.265
"well, then,

867
00:51:47.332 --> 00:51:49.333
"you'll have
to kill me,


868
00:51:49.402 --> 00:51:53.471
Because my wife
ain't going nowhere."


869
00:51:53.539 --> 00:51:57.074
Oh, Eve...

870
00:51:57.142 --> 00:52:02.246
In that moment, I knew
that I loved Maynard.


871
00:52:02.314 --> 00:52:06.451
He was so calm and brave,

872
00:52:06.519 --> 00:52:08.185
And it was Hosea
who was trembling.


873
00:52:10.222 --> 00:52:12.690
Maynard said...

874
00:52:12.758 --> 00:52:15.427
"Mozelle...

875
00:52:15.494 --> 00:52:19.864
"tell this man you ain't
going nowhere with him,


876
00:52:19.932 --> 00:52:24.101
So he can get the hell
out of my house."


877
00:52:24.169 --> 00:52:28.773
Mama was standing in
the doorway of the kitchen,


878
00:52:28.841 --> 00:52:31.709
And she was holding
her heart like this.


879
00:52:34.513 --> 00:52:37.248
I walked slowly over...

880
00:52:51.396 --> 00:52:56.501
And I stood
next to my husband,


881
00:52:56.569 --> 00:53:00.805
And I looked at my lover,

882
00:53:00.873 --> 00:53:04.275
This man who had lit
this great fire in me,


883
00:53:04.343 --> 00:53:08.513
And I said,
please, leave our house.


884
00:53:08.581 --> 00:53:12.617
I never want
to see you again.


885
00:53:14.119 --> 00:53:16.053
Hosea's eyes
went another color,


886
00:53:16.121 --> 00:53:18.456
And he stopped trembling.

887
00:53:18.524 --> 00:53:21.693
He looked right at me,

888
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.561
And he said...

889
00:53:23.629 --> 00:53:26.130
Hosea:
All right then.


890

[gunshot]

891
00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:33.237
And he shot Maynard
in the chest.


892
00:53:33.305 --> 00:53:36.173
And I was alone...

893

I'm doing up?

Ahh, look who's up.

You know
what time it is?


905
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:21.485
It's time for you gals
to be in bed.


906
00:54:21.553 --> 00:54:22.619
No, daddy.

907
00:54:22.687 --> 00:54:24.621
Yes. Your mama
would kill me


908

If she finds out
I had you up.

I don't know yet.

922

My wife left me
a year ago.


923
00:56:00.251 --> 00:56:04.387
I've been to many cities
searching for her.

I'm afraid she might

What did you think,
running off like that?

You almost gave your mama
a heart attack, <i>ch√®re.</i>

Where the hell did you go?

951
00:58:26.814 --> 00:58:28.515
I went to visit daddy.

952
00:58:28.583 --> 00:58:30.817
Then I went
to the beauty parlor.


953

You what?

954
00:58:43.598 --> 00:58:47.033
I walked all the way
to daddy's office,

00:58:47.101 --> 00:58:49.736
And then I caught
the bus to Opels'.


956
00:58:49.804 --> 00:58:52.138
I had to cross
the train tracks


957
00:58:52.206 --> 00:58:53.807
To get home,

958
00:58:53.875 --> 00:58:55.509
And I'm alive, mama.

959
00:58:55.576 --> 00:58:57.944
I didn't get hit
by anything.


960
00:59:57.538 --> 00:59:59.238
Come here, Cisely.

961
01:00:15.489 --> 01:00:18.491
When I was your age,
I was just like you.


962

I thought I knew
everything.

Now even the things
I'm most familiar with


964
01:00:25.967 --> 01:00:28.001
Seem mysterious to me.

965
01:00:30.537 --> 01:00:32.872
But I know I love you.

966
01:00:35.643 --> 01:00:37.543
And it's my job

967
01:00:37.612 --> 01:00:41.481
To protect you
as best I can.

and leave this house again,

for him anymore.

I'll say it one more time,

01:11:35.068 --> 01:11:38.137
Part of it was about me

1150
01:11:38.204 --> 01:11:42.008
And how he let me
visit him that day.


1151
01:11:43.677 --> 01:11:46.545
The other thing
they were fighting about...


1152
01:11:48.181 --> 01:11:50.315
Was Matty Mereaux.

1153
01:11:52.218 --> 01:11:54.954
Mama knows about
daddy and Matty?


1154
01:11:57.024 --> 01:11:58.991
Everybody knows.

1155
01:11:59.059 --> 01:12:00.526
She's been hanging
around his office,


1156
01:12:00.593 --> 01:12:02.294
Right in front
of everyone.


1157
01:12:02.362 --> 01:12:04.797
You believe me now

1158
01:12:04.865 --> 01:12:06.799
About what happened
at the party?


1159
01:12:09.936 --> 01:12:11.804
I believed you then.

1160
01:12:14.107 --> 01:12:15.808
Anyway...

1161
01:12:15.876 --> 01:12:20.612
I waited until I heard
mama go upstairs.


1162
01:12:23.216 --> 01:12:25.184
I went downstairs.

1163
01:12:28.789 --> 01:12:32.124
I was afraid of what
she might have said.


1164
01:12:36.697 --> 01:12:39.865
I was afraid
he would divorce us.

[thunder]

1166
01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.841
I wanted to make him
feel better.


1167
01:12:58.586 --> 01:13:00.787
I sat on his lap.

1168
01:13:02.122 --> 01:13:04.490
And I was scared.

1169
01:13:22.476 --> 01:13:23.977
And I was trying
to get away,


1170
01:13:24.044 --> 01:13:26.913
And he was hugging me
and kissing me...


1171
01:13:26.981 --> 01:13:29.816
Until I finally
pushed him away with my knee.


1172
01:13:29.883 --> 01:13:33.786
I must have hurt him
because he hit me.


1173
01:13:33.854 --> 01:13:36.756
[sobbing]
he's never hit me.


1174
01:13:39.259 --> 01:13:41.393
Baby. Baby, I'm sorry.

1175
01:13:41.461 --> 01:13:44.130
And then I ran.

1176
01:13:46.834 --> 01:13:48.635
I'll kill him,
Cisely.


1177
01:13:48.702 --> 01:13:50.503
I swear it.

1178
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:53.773
I'll kill him
for hurting you.


1179

[birds chirping]

1180
01:14:12.726 --> 01:14:15.327
Bye-bye, now.

1181
01:14:15.395 --> 01:14:17.780
Roz: I'll be gone
a week or so.


1182
01:14:17.847 --> 01:14:20.216
I just want to get her
settled in.


1183
01:14:22.719 --> 01:14:25.271
Bye, Poe.
Be good.


1184
01:14:34.748 --> 01:14:37.633
I'm just going
to drop them off.


1185
01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.601
Be back before dinner.

1186

[car starts]

[door closes]

1188
01:15:28.385 --> 01:15:30.853
Maybe he ran
into traffic.


1189
01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.321
It's Sunday.

1190
01:15:37.794 --> 01:15:41.130
He'll be back
and so will Cisely.


1191
01:15:41.198 --> 01:15:43.899
I know she will.

1192
01:15:43.967 --> 01:15:47.103
Life is filled
with good-byes, Eve--


1193
01:15:47.170 --> 01:15:48.637
A million good-byes--

1194
01:15:48.705 --> 01:15:51.507
And it hurts every time.

1195
01:15:52.675 --> 01:15:56.078
Sometimes I feel like
I've lost so much,


1196
01:15:56.146 --> 01:15:59.581
I have to find
new things to lose.


1197
01:15:59.649 --> 01:16:03.785
All I know is there must be
a divine point to it all,


1198
01:16:03.853 --> 01:16:06.288
And it's just over my head.

1199
01:16:06.356 --> 01:16:11.193
Then, when we die,
it will all come clear,


1200
01:16:11.261 --> 01:16:12.828
And we'll say...

1201
01:16:12.896 --> 01:16:16.532
"so that was
the damn point."


1202
01:16:16.599 --> 01:16:20.569
And sometimes I think
there's no point at all,


1203
01:16:20.637 --> 01:16:23.172
And that's the point.

1204
01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.509
All I know is
most people's lives


1205
01:16:26.576 --> 01:16:29.278
Are a great disappointment
to them.


1206
01:16:29.346 --> 01:16:31.713
And no one leaves
this earth


1207
01:16:31.781 --> 01:16:34.850
Without feeling
terrible pain.


1208
01:16:34.918 --> 01:16:37.853
And if there is
no divine explanation


1209
01:16:37.921 --> 01:16:40.156
At the end of it all,
well...


1210
01:16:41.925 --> 01:16:44.360
That's sad.

1211
01:16:46.963 --> 01:16:50.066
How do you kill someone
with voodoo?


1212
01:16:51.601 --> 01:16:52.834
[laughs]

1213
01:16:52.902 --> 01:16:55.604
I almost forgot
you was there.


1214
01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:00.076
I mean, do you just
wish real hard


1215
01:17:00.143 --> 01:17:01.643
That they were dead,

1216
01:17:01.711 --> 01:17:03.879
Or do you have to do
something special?


1217
01:17:03.947 --> 01:17:07.583
I suppose you put some
of their hair on a doll


1218
01:17:07.650 --> 01:17:09.318
And stick pins in it
or something.


1219
01:17:09.386 --> 01:17:11.253
I really don't know.

1220
01:17:11.321 --> 01:17:14.723
What makes you ask
a thing like that?


1221
01:17:14.791 --> 01:17:15.757
Nothing.

1222
01:17:15.825 --> 01:17:18.894
Well, you must have been
thinking something


1223
01:17:18.962 --> 01:17:21.330
Right before
you were thinking that.


1224
01:17:21.398 --> 01:17:24.266
What led you to that
particular thought?


1225
01:17:25.502 --> 01:17:27.970
I don't know.

1226
01:17:29.372 --> 01:17:33.809
Is there someone around here
that you're angry with?


1227
01:17:33.876 --> 01:17:36.678
Someone
that you want dead?


1228
01:17:38.315 --> 01:17:39.781
I'm going inside.

1229
01:17:39.849 --> 01:17:44.019
No. I think you better
tell me what's on your mind.


1230
01:17:44.087 --> 01:17:47.490
You have 5 seconds.

1231
01:17:51.027 --> 01:17:53.496
Give me your hands.

1232
01:17:56.199 --> 01:17:58.601
Give them to me.

1233
01:18:12.115 --> 01:18:14.683
Well, go on and keep secrets
if you want to.


1234
01:18:14.751 --> 01:18:16.619
I won't squeeze it
out of you.


1235
01:18:16.686 --> 01:18:20.356
But you can't kill people
with voodoo.


1236
01:18:20.423 --> 01:18:21.524

Apples.

1249

walked right past them.

1260

I just stay on campus.

But usually, you know,
I try to get home

So Matty don't get
too lonely.

she's the lonely type.

No. Someone else.

of this person.

I brought you some
from a comb.

Always bothering me.

1326

Is he dead yet?

How could he be dead?

1328
01:26:33.298 --> 01:26:34.866
You didn't give me
the doll.


1329
01:26:34.934 --> 01:26:37.135
What doll?

1330
01:26:37.202 --> 01:26:39.470
I didn't say nothing
to you about no doll.

1334
01:26:47.246 --> 01:26:50.716
I put his hair inside
the mouth of a snake,


1335
01:26:50.784 --> 01:26:53.368
Buried it
in the graveyard.


1336

He should be dead
by now.

to do something first,

You brought me
his hair.

01:37:54.746 --> 01:37:57.181
But to a certain
type of woman,


1472
01:37:57.249 --> 01:37:58.582
I'm a hero.

1473
01:37:58.650 --> 01:38:02.720
I need to be a hero
sometimes.


1474
01:38:02.788 --> 01:38:06.490
That's my weakness,
that much is true.


1475
01:38:06.558 --> 01:38:07.992
But how, Mozelle,

1476
01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:10.194
Could I have sunk
in your estimation


1477
01:38:10.262 --> 01:38:11.562
To the leechy depths

1478
01:38:11.630 --> 01:38:13.298
Where you would
accuse me


1479
01:38:13.365 --> 01:38:17.302
Of deliberately abusing
my most beloved child?


1480
01:38:17.369 --> 01:38:20.138
I am guilty in the sense
that I adore her,


1481
01:38:20.205 --> 01:38:23.574
And I allowed her
to adore me.


1482
01:38:23.642 --> 01:38:25.743
It was
a sweet indulgence,


1483
01:38:25.811 --> 01:38:28.746
But nothing in her behavior
prepared me


1484
01:38:28.814 --> 01:38:31.015
For what happened
on the night of the Storm.


1485
01:38:31.450 --> 01:38:32.300
[thunder
and shouting]


1486
01:38:32.367 --> 01:38:34.535
Louis: Roz and I had
a terrible fight,


1487
01:38:34.603 --> 01:38:37.605
And I guess
it was inevitable.


1488
01:38:37.673 --> 01:38:38.906
Roz!

1489
01:38:38.973 --> 01:38:41.842
I knew Cisely could never sleep
through a fight like that,


1490
01:38:41.910 --> 01:38:45.879
So I wasn't surprised
when she came downstairs.


1491
01:38:45.947 --> 01:38:48.816
And maybe I was even
waiting for her.


1492
01:38:48.883 --> 01:38:51.852
I let myself wallow
in filial comfort.


1493
01:38:56.358 --> 01:38:58.326
Mozelle, I swear,

1494
01:38:58.393 --> 01:39:01.562
The first kiss
was the sweetest kiss


1495
01:39:01.630 --> 01:39:05.733
A daughter could give a drunk
and guilt-ridden father.


1496
01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:07.167
A kiss of redemption.

1497
01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.042
In the next moment,
it had gone wrong.


1498
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:17.511
From my scotch haze,
it took me a second


1499
01:39:17.579 --> 01:39:21.782
To realize that my daughter
was kissing me like a woman.


1500
01:39:21.850 --> 01:39:23.517
This is where
I blame myself.


1501
01:39:23.585 --> 01:39:24.818
Cisely, no!

1502
01:39:24.886 --> 01:39:26.687
I was so startled
that I hit her


1503
01:39:26.755 --> 01:39:28.389
And she fell
to the floor.


1504
01:39:28.457 --> 01:39:31.626
The look she gave me
almost stopped my heart.


1505
01:39:31.693 --> 01:39:32.960
Oh, Cisely.

1506
01:39:33.027 --> 01:39:34.695
And I knew I had lost her.

1507
01:39:34.763 --> 01:39:36.063
Baby. Baby, I'm sorry.

1508
01:39:36.131 --> 01:39:38.132
Mozelle,
I would give my life


1509
01:39:38.199 --> 01:39:40.033
To have that moment back.

1510
01:39:40.101 --> 01:39:42.870
I would hold her
and comfort her.


1511
01:39:42.937 --> 01:39:44.772
We would talk
through her confusion,


1512
01:39:44.839 --> 01:39:47.107
And I would put her to bed

1513
01:39:47.175 --> 01:39:49.677
With the boundaries
between us intact.


1514
01:39:49.745 --> 01:39:53.113
I love her more
than my life.


1515
01:39:53.181 --> 01:39:56.850
I hope that one day
she can forgive me.


1516
01:39:56.918 --> 01:39:59.553
I felt I could not
betray her again


1517
01:39:59.621 --> 01:40:02.156
By telling you
or Roslyn.


1518
01:40:02.223 --> 01:40:03.991
Forgive me...

1519
01:40:04.058 --> 01:40:05.259
Liar!

1520
01:40:05.327 --> 01:40:07.428
Louis.

1521
01:40:07.496 --> 01:40:08.362
What?

1522
01:40:10.131 --> 01:40:13.033
You lied to me
about daddy!


1523
01:40:13.101 --> 01:40:15.736
You lied!

1524
01:40:15.804 --> 01:40:18.038
Daddy wrote Mozelle
a letter!


1525
01:40:18.106 --> 01:40:19.523
You lied!

1526
01:40:19.591 --> 01:40:21.425
I wasn't lying!

1527
01:40:21.493 --> 01:40:24.295
I believed you!

1528
01:40:24.362 --> 01:40:26.764
And I hated him.

1529
01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.301
I hated him for you.

1530
01:40:40.179 --> 01:40:42.346
He hurt me, Eve.

1531
01:40:42.414 --> 01:40:45.482
He hurt me...

1532
01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:47.785
So badly...

1533
01:40:47.853 --> 01:40:49.553
I wanted to die.

1534
01:40:58.396 --> 01:41:00.431
Tell me what happened.

1535
01:41:03.268 --> 01:41:04.668
Please!

1536
01:41:04.737 --> 01:41:07.471
I have to know.

1537
01:41:07.539 --> 01:41:08.773
I can't.

1538
01:41:17.449 --> 01:41:19.316
Please.

1539
01:41:50.532 --> 01:41:52.266
I don't know
what happened.


1540
01:41:55.504 --> 01:41:57.505
I don't know.

1541
01:42:00.341 --> 01:42:01.275
It's ok.

1542
01:42:01.342 --> 01:42:02.342
I can't!

1543
01:42:02.411 --> 01:42:04.077
[sobbing]

1544
01:42:06.381 --> 01:42:07.748
I can't.

1545
01:42:07.816 --> 01:42:09.216
It's ok.

1546
01:42:09.284 --> 01:42:11.018
Shh...Shh...Shh...

1547
01:42:16.809 --> 01:42:19.343
Adult Eve: The Summer
my father said good night,


1548
01:42:19.411 --> 01:42:22.146
I was 10 years old...

1549
01:42:22.214 --> 01:42:24.849
My brother Poe was 9...

1550
01:42:24.917 --> 01:42:29.520
And my sister Cisely
had just turned 14.


1551
01:42:33.125 --> 01:42:34.926
We are the descendants

1552
01:42:34.993 --> 01:42:38.495
Of Eve
and Jean Paul Batiste.


1553
01:42:38.563 --> 01:42:40.364
I was named for her.

1554
01:42:45.437 --> 01:42:47.638
Like others before me...

1555
01:42:47.706 --> 01:42:49.874
I have the gift of sight.

1556
01:42:49.942 --> 01:42:54.411
But the truth changes color
depending on the light.


1557
01:42:54.479 --> 01:42:57.748
And tomorrow can be clearer
than yesterday.


1558
01:42:59.918 --> 01:43:03.354
Memory is a selection
of images...


1559
01:43:03.421 --> 01:43:05.122
Some elusive...

1560
01:43:05.190 --> 01:43:08.592
Others printed indelibly
on the brain.


1561
01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:13.430
Each image is like a thread,
each thread woven together


1562
01:43:13.498 --> 01:43:16.700
To make a tapestry
of intricate texture.


1563
01:43:16.768 --> 01:43:19.803
And the tapestry
tells a story.


1564
01:43:19.872 --> 01:43:21.906
And the story is our past.

1565
01:44:01.646 --> 01:44:04.581
.

1566
01:44:04.649 --> 01:44:07.584
