(waves crashing)

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:36.004
(soft suspenseful music)

4
00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.109
- God, just give me a sign.

5
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:47.515
(soft suspenseful music)

6
00:02:55.924 --> 00:02:59.357

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.262

00:03:10.471 --> 00:03:13.875
(soft suspenseful music)

9
00:03:15.777 --> 00:03:17.045
Give me a sign.

10
00:03:18.846 --> 00:03:20.247
What should I do?

11
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.386
God, please take
care of my family.


12
00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:30.423
(voices echoing)

13
00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:32.026
Hello! Who's there?

14
00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.967
(stream running)

15
00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:41.901
(bird calling)

16
00:03:41.903 --> 00:03:43.404
Hey, are you okay?

17
00:03:44.472 --> 00:03:47.172
(bird calling)

18
00:03:47.174 --> 00:03:49.240
Are you alone out here?

19
00:03:49.242 --> 00:03:52.612
(suspenseful piano music)

20
00:03:52.614 --> 00:03:56.214
Do you want me to help
you find your family?


21
00:03:56.216 --> 00:03:59.687
(suspenseful piano music)

22
00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:08.861
Wait!

23
00:04:08.863 --> 00:04:11.464
(suspenseful piano music)

24
00:04:11.466 --> 00:04:12.832
You forgot something!

25
00:04:12.834 --> 00:04:16.336
(suspenseful piano music)

26
00:04:21.208 --> 00:04:23.778
(bird calling)

27
00:04:25.046 --> 00:04:26.179
You dropped your doll.

28
00:04:27.115 --> 00:04:30.518
(soft suspenseful music)

29
00:04:33.121 --> 00:04:35.821

(suspenseful piano music)

34
00:05:33.381 --> 00:05:35.448
- Rest in peace, Angel.

35
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.953
(suspenseful piano music)

36
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.189
God bless you.

37
00:05:43.191 --> 00:05:46.594
(soft suspenseful music)

38
00:06:00.608 --> 00:06:03.177

00:06:33.574 --> 00:06:36.978
(soft suspenseful music)

42
00:06:45.453 --> 00:06:48.721
(Adrian breathing hard)

43
00:06:48.723 --> 00:06:52.160
(soft suspenseful music)

44
00:06:54.996 --> 00:06:55.830
Whoa!

45
00:06:56.898 --> 00:06:59.198
(girl laughing)

46
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.934
(suspenseful piano music)

47
00:07:01.936 --> 00:07:04.605
(girl laughing)

48
00:07:08.109 --> 00:07:11.612
(suspenseful piano music)

49
00:07:23.491 --> 00:07:26.125
(thunder clapping)

50
00:07:26.127 --> 00:07:29.630
(suspenseful piano music)

51
00:07:31.465 --> 00:07:33.999
(thunder rolling)

52
00:07:34.001 --> 00:07:36.602
(suspenseful piano music)

53
00:07:36.604 --> 00:07:38.838
(girl laughing)

54
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.272
(suspenseful piano music)

55
00:07:40.274 --> 00:07:43.110
(thunder rolling)

56
00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:00.194
(voices whispering)

57
00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:04.129
(soft suspenseful music)

58
00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:06.968
(thunder rolling)

59
00:08:09.637 --> 00:08:11.303
- [Girl] I want my doll.

60
00:08:11.305 --> 00:08:14.709
(soft suspenseful music)

61
00:08:27.788 --> 00:08:30.458
(waves lapping)

62
00:08:46.073 --> 00:08:46.974
- We're here.

63
00:08:51.245 --> 00:08:52.146
Another nightmare?

64
00:08:54.115 --> 00:08:56.215
- It's nothing.

65
00:08:56.217 --> 00:08:58.150
(birds singing)

66
00:08:58.152 --> 00:08:59.518
Is this it?

67
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.786
Are we here?

68
00:09:00.788 --> 00:09:02.521
- Why are you so impatient?

69
00:09:02.523 --> 00:09:04.823
I've been the one who's
doing all the driving.


70
00:09:04.825 --> 00:09:07.028
- I'm not impatient.
I'm just tired.


71
00:09:10.498 --> 00:09:11.830
- A thank you would be nice.

72
00:09:11.832 --> 00:09:14.967
I mean, I'm not the one
who chose to come here.


73
00:09:14.969 --> 00:09:16.669
- Why are you trying
to cause an argument?


74
00:09:16.671 --> 00:09:17.870
- Me?

75
00:09:17.872 --> 00:09:19.340
You're the one
with the attitude.


76
00:09:20.541 --> 00:09:23.242
- You know how I am
after I have a nap.


77
00:09:23.244 --> 00:09:24.946
- Which is why I
hate you napping.


78
00:09:28.383 --> 00:09:29.848
- You can hate me
napping all you like,


79
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.652
but you can't
control me, Oliver.


80
00:09:33.087 --> 00:09:36.324
- I know, believe me. And I
have no intention of doing so.


81
00:09:37.258 --> 00:09:38.092
- Good.

82
00:09:42.029 --> 00:09:42.863
- Hey?

83
00:09:45.032 --> 00:09:46.532
- What?

84
00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:48.467
- Your attitude isn't the
only think that stinks.


85
00:09:48.469 --> 00:09:49.969
- So rude.

86
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:50.972
- Least I'm honest.

87
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:53.574
- No.

88
00:09:57.678 --> 00:09:58.512
- Let's go then.

89
00:10:05.219 --> 00:10:07.586
(waves lapping)

90
00:10:07.588 --> 00:10:10.491
(soft piano music)

91
00:10:20.901 --> 00:10:23.902
(waves lapping)

92
00:10:23.904 --> 00:10:26.841
(soft piano music)

93
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.553
(Oliver sighing)

94
00:10:41.555 --> 00:10:43.390
I thought that journey
would never end.


95
00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:45.924
- Well, we're here now, so.

96
00:10:45.926 --> 00:10:47.593
- Where should we start?

97
00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:48.894
(birds calling)

98
00:10:48.896 --> 00:10:51.098
- Say we head into town
and take it from there?


99
00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:54.033
- You know what?

100
00:10:54.035 --> 00:10:55.234
- What?

101
00:10:55.236 --> 00:10:57.437
- I know I was against
coming here, but


102
00:10:57.439 --> 00:10:58.837
I think this is
exactly what I needed.


103
00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:00.007
It could be good for me.

104
00:11:00.808 --> 00:11:02.409
Good for us.

105
00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:05.079
I mean, I know we've had
our difficulties, but


106
00:11:06.481 --> 00:11:08.580
I think this could give
us the time we need.


107
00:11:08.582 --> 00:11:09.915
Since I've known you,
I've spent more time


108
00:11:09.917 --> 00:11:12.051
in the office than
in your company.


109
00:11:12.053 --> 00:11:14.853
- All work and no play makes
Oliver a dull boy (laughs).


110
00:11:14.855 --> 00:11:16.391
- Doesn't it just (laughs)?

111
00:11:19.026 --> 00:11:20.993
Think we should start that way.

112
00:11:20.995 --> 00:11:22.795
I have a feeling it's right.

113
00:11:22.797 --> 00:11:24.563
- You're not gonna get
us lost again, are you?


114
00:11:24.565 --> 00:11:26.198
- It's all part of
the adventure, baby.


115
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.034
- Mm.

116
00:11:27.902 --> 00:11:30.869
(waves crashing)

117
00:11:30.871 --> 00:11:31.705
- Are you?

118
00:11:34.975 --> 00:11:35.810
Don't worry.

119
00:11:36.644 --> 00:11:38.143
- What? Sorry.

120
00:11:38.145 --> 00:11:40.581
- It's uh, it's
nothing. Let's just go.


121
00:11:41.749 --> 00:11:42.551
- Okay.

122
00:11:44.118 --> 00:11:46.852
(Maria laughing)

123
00:11:46.854 --> 00:11:50.324
(suspenseful piano music)

124
00:11:55.497 --> 00:11:58.199
(waves crashing)

125
00:12:02.537 --> 00:12:05.206
(waves lapping)

126
00:12:08.609 --> 00:12:12.012
- Maybe this wasn't the best
time of year to come here.


127
00:12:13.448 --> 00:12:16.248
Let's go away, she said.
We'll have fun, she said.


128
00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:17.084
- Stop.

129
00:12:18.752 --> 00:12:20.018
Look, when we get to the island,

130
00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:21.622
you're gonna have
so much material.


131
00:12:22.591 --> 00:12:25.259
(waves lapping)

132
00:12:27.862 --> 00:12:29.797
Look, about earlier,

133
00:12:31.198 --> 00:12:33.568
I'm sorry, just got a
lot on my mind right now.


134
00:12:34.969 --> 00:12:37.572
- It's okay, I know. I
just wish you'd talk to me.


135
00:12:38.607 --> 00:12:39.539
- I will.

136
00:12:39.541 --> 00:12:41.039
- Can you hold this?

137
00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:42.174
Thanks.

138
00:12:42.176 --> 00:12:44.977
(soft piano music)

139
00:12:44.979 --> 00:12:47.547
(waves lapping)

140
00:12:47.549 --> 00:12:48.947
Thanks.

141
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:50.450
Do you wanna?

142
00:12:50.452 --> 00:12:53.087
(waves lapping)

143
00:12:56.157 --> 00:12:57.390
- We've come all this way.

144
00:12:57.392 --> 00:12:59.091
Just take us to the
fricking island.


145
00:12:59.093 --> 00:13:00.259
- I don't have a
problem with you,


146
00:13:00.261 --> 00:13:01.927
only with your stupidity.

147
00:13:01.929 --> 00:13:03.262
- What?
- Excuse me.


148
00:13:03.264 --> 00:13:04.597
- The Island of
Dolls is not a place


149
00:13:04.599 --> 00:13:06.798
for a romantic getaway.

150
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.101
- He's my brother.
- She's my sister.


151
00:13:09.103 --> 00:13:11.203
(Guillermo sighing)

152
00:13:11.205 --> 00:13:13.939
- Okay, fine, I'll take you.

153
00:13:13.941 --> 00:13:15.441
But it won't be cheap.

154
00:13:15.443 --> 00:13:18.812
- Well, just so happens
money's not an issue. So good.


155
00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.449
(water lapping)

156
00:13:23.451 --> 00:13:27.319
- Hi, I think we're all
going to the same place?


157
00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:30.492
- Oh, happy days, we
can split the bill then.


158
00:13:31.692 --> 00:13:34.460
- Hi, I'm Yaz. This
is my brother Jake.


159
00:13:34.462 --> 00:13:35.994
- I'm Oliver.

160
00:13:35.996 --> 00:13:37.597
- Hello, mate.

161
00:13:37.599 --> 00:13:38.567
- Hi, I'm Maria.

162
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:43.370
- Fantastic, Maria.

163
00:13:44.805 --> 00:13:46.772
- Guys, if you insist on
going, we must leave now.


164
00:13:46.774 --> 00:13:48.441
The tide changes too fast.

165
00:13:48.443 --> 00:13:50.610
- All right, all
right. Chill out.


166
00:13:50.612 --> 00:13:52.110
Let's go then.

167
00:13:52.112 --> 00:13:54.514
(water lapping)

168
00:13:54.516 --> 00:13:56.482
- Is everything all right?

169
00:13:56.484 --> 00:13:57.351
- Doesn't seem it.

170
00:13:58.653 --> 00:14:01.521
- Yeah, no, we just had
a long day, that's all.


171
00:14:01.523 --> 00:14:02.957
- We had a hell of a journey.

172
00:14:04.058 --> 00:14:05.824
- It's not an easy
place to get to, is it?


173
00:14:05.826 --> 00:14:07.192
- No, not at all.

174
00:14:07.194 --> 00:14:08.894
But I'm already getting
some great shots.


175
00:14:08.896 --> 00:14:10.295
We're not even there yet.

176
00:14:10.297 --> 00:14:12.432
- Oh, sweet. Let's have
a little look, mate.


177
00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:13.666
- You're a photographer?

178
00:14:13.668 --> 00:14:16.268
- Who knows? Isn't
everyone these days?


179
00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:17.769
- Not everyone has the talent.

180
00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:19.171
- No, but everyone
has the capability


181
00:14:19.173 --> 00:14:20.607
in the palm of their hands.

182
00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:21.873
- Mm.

183
00:14:21.875 --> 00:14:23.041
- Yeah, I've never
really usually got


184
00:14:23.043 --> 00:14:24.977
enough memory for photos.

185
00:14:24.979 --> 00:14:26.579
- Because you're
phone is full of porn.


186
00:14:26.581 --> 00:14:27.682
- Shut up, Yaz.

187
00:14:29.684 --> 00:14:31.183
- What about you, Maria?

188
00:14:31.185 --> 00:14:33.620
- Well, it was her idea to
come here in the first place.


189
00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:37.222
- No, no, I just heard
about this place online


190
00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:39.692
so thought we
should check it out.


191
00:14:39.694 --> 00:14:41.893
- I don't like
taking people there.


192
00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:44.633
It's the energy. It's
unnatural, haunting.


193
00:14:46.701 --> 00:14:48.369
- What do you know
about the island?


194
00:14:49.336 --> 00:14:51.203
(water lapping)

195
00:14:51.205 --> 00:14:54.306
- Enough. I have no
need to know more.


196
00:14:54.308 --> 00:14:58.176
(soft suspenseful music)

197
00:14:58.178 --> 00:14:59.346
And neither should you.

198
00:15:00.515 --> 00:15:03.418
- Oh, well way to put a
damper on the holiday.


199
00:15:05.252 --> 00:15:06.655
- Come on, get in my boat.

200
00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:10.523
(soft suspenseful music)

201
00:15:10.525 --> 00:15:13.258
(water lapping)

202
00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.698
(soft suspenseful music)

203
00:15:29.009 --> 00:15:31.780
(waves crashing)

204
00:15:36.984 --> 00:15:37.883
- Yaz, was it?

205
00:15:37.885 --> 00:15:38.720
- Yeah, why?

206
00:15:41.623 --> 00:15:44.156
- So this is my number.

207
00:15:44.158 --> 00:15:46.726
- Come on, Casanova, chill out.

208
00:15:46.728 --> 00:15:49.194
- So, the tide will
be too low for me


209
00:15:49.196 --> 00:15:52.398
to come back until tomorrow
evening, the earliest.


210
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.667
So call me when you
want picking up.


211
00:15:54.669 --> 00:15:56.168
- Thanks.

212
00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.037
- Oh, and don't take anything
from the island. I mean it.


213
00:15:59.039 --> 00:16:01.774
Look, but don't touch.
That's our word here.


214
00:16:01.776 --> 00:16:03.443
- Sure.

215
00:16:03.445 --> 00:16:05.210
- What's his problem?

216
00:16:05.212 --> 00:16:06.746
- Locals, isn't it, mate?

217
00:16:06.748 --> 00:16:10.048
Always superstitious, especially
the weird goblin types.


218
00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:11.151
- Why are you staring?

219
00:16:12.853 --> 00:16:15.588
- Come on, let's look at
some weird dolls then.


220
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:19.091
(suspenseful piano music)

221
00:16:19.093 --> 00:16:21.763
(birds singing)

222
00:16:26.266 --> 00:16:29.771
(suspenseful piano music)

223
00:16:46.588 --> 00:16:49.256
(birds singing)

224
00:16:51.291 --> 00:16:53.892
Anyone want a bit of this?

225
00:16:53.894 --> 00:16:56.161
- Thought you were
gonna quit smoking.


226
00:16:56.163 --> 00:16:58.363
- All right, I will, but
you don't come to The Island


227
00:16:58.365 --> 00:17:01.199
of the Dolls without getting
a little bit high at least.


228
00:17:01.201 --> 00:17:03.103
Could be my best
trip yet, I reckon.


229
00:17:04.304 --> 00:17:07.973
- I don't think you're
gonna need the drugs.


230
00:17:07.975 --> 00:17:10.110
- Oh, Guillermo told us
not to touch anything.


231
00:17:11.111 --> 00:17:13.882
(birds chirping)

232
00:17:15.683 --> 00:17:18.318
- [Jake] This place is
creepy as shit, man.


233
00:17:19.654 --> 00:17:21.721
- What were you expecting?

234
00:17:21.723 --> 00:17:22.988
- I don't know.

235
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.291
Like a toy shop on
acid or something.


236
00:17:26.293 --> 00:17:27.794
Guess it's not that far off.

237
00:17:27.796 --> 00:17:28.863
- Not far off at all.

238
00:17:29.864 --> 00:17:32.534
(birds singing)

239
00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:41.774
- [Jake] I'm taking
a look around.


240
00:17:41.776 --> 00:17:43.141
- Oh, Jake, can I come with you?

241
00:17:43.143 --> 00:17:45.012
- Mm, I think it's
too late for that.


242
00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.213
- He is such a nightmare.

243
00:17:48.215 --> 00:17:49.682
It is literally
like a school trip


244
00:17:49.684 --> 00:17:51.684
trying to get
information from him.


245
00:17:51.686 --> 00:17:53.120
- Hm, you guys
seem close, though.


246
00:17:54.154 --> 00:17:55.322
- Yeah, I mean,

247
00:17:56.391 --> 00:17:57.224
we are.

248
00:17:58.426 --> 00:18:00.428
He's my brother, I love
him unconditionally, but


249
00:18:01.729 --> 00:18:03.565
I think if we weren't related,

250
00:18:04.666 --> 00:18:06.734
I'd probably want
nothing to do with him.


251
00:18:08.235 --> 00:18:11.369
- Yeah, it's a shame we can't
choose our family, right?


252
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:13.873
- (laughs) Yeah, a
self-indulged drug addict


253
00:18:13.875 --> 00:18:16.208
would be at the
bottom of my list.


254
00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:17.577
(Maria chuckles)

255
00:18:17.579 --> 00:18:18.845
(birds singing)

256
00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:19.980
So, what's the deal
with you and Oliver?


257
00:18:21.114 --> 00:18:22.015
- What's the deal?

258
00:18:22.951 --> 00:18:24.784
He's my partner.

259
00:18:24.786 --> 00:18:25.618
- Are you married?

260
00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.454
- No, no.

261
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:29.354
He's my boyfriend.

262
00:18:29.356 --> 00:18:30.857
I don't really like that phrase.

263
00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:33.093
Kinda makes me feel
like I'm 16 again.


264
00:18:34.328 --> 00:18:35.260
Hm.

265
00:18:35.262 --> 00:18:36.796
- What's wrong with that?

266
00:18:36.798 --> 00:18:38.466
I'd give anything
to be 16 again.


267
00:18:39.868 --> 00:18:42.937
- Yeah, to be fair, so would I.

268
00:18:44.037 --> 00:18:46.073
- It's pathetic, but I ...

269
00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.774
- Yeah, no, it's fine, go.

270
00:18:48.776 --> 00:18:51.209
- I'll catch you later. Jake.

271
00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:52.512
- Oliver?

272
00:18:52.514 --> 00:18:55.182
(birds singing)

273
00:18:57.284 --> 00:18:58.451
- See this?

274
00:18:58.453 --> 00:18:59.452
- Mm.

275
00:18:59.454 --> 00:19:01.621
(birds singing)

276
00:19:01.623 --> 00:19:04.557
(stream running)

277
00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:07.227
(birds singing)

278
00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:17.269
- (whispers) Want
to see some more?


279
00:19:17.271 --> 00:19:18.437
- Who's there?

280
00:19:18.439 --> 00:19:20.338
(soft suspenseful music)

281
00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.809
(girl laughing)

282
00:19:23.811 --> 00:19:25.145
What's so funny?

283
00:19:26.948 --> 00:19:29.314
- (whispers) I'll show you.

284
00:19:29.316 --> 00:19:32.919
(soft suspenseful music)

285
00:19:32.921 --> 00:19:36.756
- Do your parents know you're
out here? Are you lost?


286
00:19:36.758 --> 00:19:38.724
- [Girl] Are you?

287
00:19:38.726 --> 00:19:42.160
(soft suspenseful music)

288
00:19:42.162 --> 00:19:44.832
(birds singing)

289
00:19:56.109 --> 00:19:58.544
(leaves rustling)

290
00:19:58.546 --> 00:20:00.982
(soft music)

291
00:20:10.058 --> 00:20:12.894
(leaves rustling)

292
00:20:17.498 --> 00:20:20.935
(soft suspenseful music)

293
00:20:34.816 --> 00:20:37.885
(gentle piano music)

294
00:20:57.405 --> 00:20:59.974
(wind humming)

295
00:21:01.976 --> 00:21:02.810
- Jake?

296
00:21:04.445 --> 00:21:08.681
- Hi. Look after me backpack,
I'm gonna go climb that tree.


297
00:21:08.683 --> 00:21:11.351
(birds singing)

298
00:21:12.387 --> 00:21:15.155
(wind whistling)

299
00:21:24.799 --> 00:21:28.235
(soft suspenseful music)

300
00:21:35.143 --> 00:21:38.211
(gentle piano music)

301
00:21:54.462 --> 00:21:57.029
- [Oliver] She
wants her doll back.


302
00:21:57.031 --> 00:22:00.068
(gentle piano music)

303
00:22:06.741 --> 00:22:09.410
(wind pounding)

304
00:22:10.545 --> 00:22:13.614
(gentle piano music)

305
00:22:20.788 --> 00:22:22.188
It's not too late.

306
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:24.423
(Maria gasping)

307
00:22:24.425 --> 00:22:27.862
(soft suspenseful music)

308
00:22:29.464 --> 00:22:31.597
- For fuck sake, Oliver.

309
00:22:31.599 --> 00:22:33.000
- Don't panic, it's only me.

310
00:22:35.302 --> 00:22:37.403
This place is so surreal.

311
00:22:37.405 --> 00:22:38.704
I know I was unsure
about coming here,


312
00:22:38.706 --> 00:22:41.272
but I think this is
exactly what I needed.


313
00:22:41.274 --> 00:22:42.808
I mean, the shots
that I'm getting,


314
00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:45.711
they're interesting
and composed.


315
00:22:45.713 --> 00:22:47.014
You know, they're layered.

316
00:22:48.248 --> 00:22:49.917
Did you find
anything interesting?


317
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.721
- I did.

318
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.158
- I passed Yaz and
Jake on the way to you.


319
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.227
They're looking for
a place to camp.


320
00:23:01.229 --> 00:23:03.763
- No, I don't think we
should stay the night.


321
00:23:03.765 --> 00:23:05.030
- Why not?

322
00:23:05.032 --> 00:23:07.199
- I don't think we need to.

323
00:23:07.201 --> 00:23:08.868
- Come on.

324
00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.504
You always wanted
to visit this place.


325
00:23:11.506 --> 00:23:13.139
- Yeah, but that doesn't mean

326
00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:15.273
that we need to stay the night.

327
00:23:15.275 --> 00:23:17.676
- But why not? I mean, we just
got here, what's the rush?


328
00:23:17.678 --> 00:23:19.612
- What if what Guillermo
said was right?


329
00:23:19.614 --> 00:23:22.148
- (laughs) Just ignore him.

330
00:23:22.150 --> 00:23:23.749
I mean, it's like
what Jake said.


331
00:23:23.751 --> 00:23:26.284
The locals are
always superstitious.


332
00:23:26.286 --> 00:23:27.520
(wind pounding)

333
00:23:27.522 --> 00:23:31.056
Let's just, make the
most of it, okay?


334
00:23:31.058 --> 00:23:34.126
(wind pounding)

335
00:23:34.128 --> 00:23:34.962
- Fine.

336
00:23:36.197 --> 00:23:37.031
Any ideas?

337
00:23:38.365 --> 00:23:39.200
- Oh yeah.

338
00:23:40.601 --> 00:23:41.433
I can think of a few.

339
00:23:41.435 --> 00:23:42.270
- Stop (laughs).

340
00:23:45.372 --> 00:23:47.706
- It's a bit late to
change your mind anyway.


341
00:23:47.708 --> 00:23:49.742
Guillermo told Yaz
that we can't leave


342
00:23:49.744 --> 00:23:51.777
till tomorrow night, so.

343
00:23:51.779 --> 00:23:54.448
(wind pounding)

344
00:23:56.217 --> 00:23:58.784
(Maria sighing)

345
00:23:58.786 --> 00:24:01.354
(wind pounding)

346
00:24:05.358 --> 00:24:08.260
(flames crackling)

347
00:24:08.262 --> 00:24:12.330
- And that wraps up Episode
One of Backwoods Brutality.

351
00:24:19.841 --> 00:24:22.975
- That was really something.

352
00:24:22.977 --> 00:24:24.643
- Thanks.

353
00:24:24.645 --> 00:24:26.979
- Uh, yeah, it um ...

354
00:24:26.981 --> 00:24:28.280
I meant that ...

355
00:24:28.282 --> 00:24:29.750
- Scan to subscribe.

356
00:24:31.152 --> 00:24:33.619

I'll have a look.

00:24:33.621 --> 00:24:35.254
(flames crackling)

358
00:24:35.256 --> 00:24:36.956
Jake, would you stop
adding logs to the fire?


359
00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:38.891
You're gonna make it too big.

360
00:24:38.893 --> 00:24:41.560
- You been moaning that
you been cold all week.


361
00:24:41.562 --> 00:24:42.663
Doing it for you, Sis.

362
00:24:43.898 --> 00:24:45.698
- That's just not true.

363
00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.899
You've been obsessed with fire

364
00:24:46.901 --> 00:24:48.500
since you were like
five years old.


365
00:24:48.502 --> 00:24:50.269
I mean, do you remember
the time that you set


366
00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:52.104
the entire garden shed on fire?

367
00:24:52.106 --> 00:24:54.673
And all of the garden toys.

368
00:24:54.675 --> 00:24:57.343
- Yeah, that was pretty
epic, to be fair, wasn't it?


369
00:24:57.345 --> 00:24:59.245
So that night I had a dream
that Guy Fawkes give me


370
00:24:59.247 --> 00:25:00.846
a little pat on the back and
said he was real proud of me.


371
00:25:00.848 --> 00:25:01.749
- Shut up (laughs).

372
00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:07.355
Would you stop going
off on your own?


373
00:25:08.556 --> 00:25:10.623
- Will you just leave me alone?

374
00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:12.660
Stop worrying, Yaz.
I'm a big boy now.


375
00:25:13.928 --> 00:25:17.563
(flames crackling)

376
00:25:17.565 --> 00:25:20.266
Thanks for letting us set up
camp with you guys anyway.


377
00:25:20.268 --> 00:25:23.135
- Aw, that's cool. We've
been here since yesterday.


378
00:25:23.137 --> 00:25:25.339
Probably better if we
stick together anyway.


379
00:25:26.774 --> 00:25:28.607
- Have you seen anything
weird since you been here?


380
00:25:28.609 --> 00:25:30.912
- Oh, we're not
ones for spoilers.


381
00:25:32.313 --> 00:25:34.513
- I'll put the bags away.

382
00:25:34.515 --> 00:25:35.349
- Thank you.

383
00:25:37.852 --> 00:25:40.786
- Maria, this is
Courtney and Dan.


384
00:25:40.788 --> 00:25:42.221
- Hi, nice to meet you.

385
00:25:42.223 --> 00:25:43.989
- Likewise. Join us.

386
00:25:43.991 --> 00:25:47.559
(flames crackling)

387
00:25:47.561 --> 00:25:49.396
- Where did you end
up going today then?


388
00:25:49.398 --> 00:25:51.463
- I just found a cabin,
had a little look around.


389
00:25:51.465 --> 00:25:54.135
- Exciting. See
anything strange?


390
00:25:55.503 --> 00:25:57.836
- Nothing different to anything
you guys would have seen.


391
00:25:57.838 --> 00:25:59.571
- Well, be careful in
one of those cabins.


392
00:25:59.573 --> 00:26:01.640
It could fall down
at any moment.


393
00:26:01.642 --> 00:26:03.842
- Oh yeah, imagine that.

394
00:26:03.844 --> 00:26:06.645
Death by cabin written
on your gravestone.


395
00:26:06.647 --> 00:26:09.048
Can think of better ways
to go, to be honest.


396
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:10.082
Think I'd rather
get stabbed by one


397
00:26:10.084 --> 00:26:11.552
of these freaky ass dolls.

398
00:26:12.753 --> 00:26:14.853
- Well, that'd be a
good story to tell.


399
00:26:14.855 --> 00:26:16.889
- Wouldn't it just (laughs)?

400
00:26:16.891 --> 00:26:19.458
- Yeah, well, wouldn't
get your hopes up.


401
00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.894
(flames crackling)

402
00:26:21.896 --> 00:26:24.332
- So, Maria, what
brought you here?


403
00:26:25.666 --> 00:26:28.968
- Oh (clears throat),
it's a long story.


404
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.602
- Perfect.
- Perfect.


405
00:26:30.604 --> 00:26:32.905
- That's what we're here for.

406
00:26:32.907 --> 00:26:34.575
- Would anybody
like to go first?


407
00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:38.844
(flames crackling)

408
00:26:38.846 --> 00:26:41.615
(animal calling)

409
00:26:43.284 --> 00:26:44.683
- What do you want me to say?

410
00:26:44.685 --> 00:26:46.318
- Just follow our lead.

411
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.488
- And be natural.

412
00:26:48.322 --> 00:26:50.324
So, who are you?

413
00:26:51.692 --> 00:26:55.527
- Who am I? Sounds like a
fucking AA meeting or something.


414
00:26:55.529 --> 00:26:57.296
- Let's just skip ahead.

415
00:26:57.298 --> 00:27:00.634
So why did you come to
The Island of Dolls?


416
00:27:02.404 --> 00:27:05.039
- Well, kinda just
got roped into it.


417
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.041
- We got some money.

418
00:27:09.076 --> 00:27:10.111
- Our parents died.

419
00:27:12.146 --> 00:27:15.082
- So, we're traveling the
world on our inheritance.


420
00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:19.520
- I really didn't wanna
come. It was Yaz's idea.


421
00:27:21.555 --> 00:27:23.889
- I just can't leave
him alone, not anymore.


422
00:27:23.891 --> 00:27:26.358
It's, it's not good for him.

423
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.360
- I want to spend
summer with the lads.


424
00:27:28.362 --> 00:27:30.295
You know, go to Amsterdam
or something cool,


425
00:27:30.297 --> 00:27:32.199
but instead, I'm here.

426
00:27:33.468 --> 00:27:35.936
- I have to take
responsibility because


427
00:27:37.439 --> 00:27:39.441
Mum and Dad didn't
do a good enough job.


428
00:27:41.308 --> 00:27:44.543
- See, at least with my
parents I got a bit of freedom.


429
00:27:44.545 --> 00:27:47.148
With my sister, it's like
being in fucking Alcatraz.


430
00:27:48.282 --> 00:27:50.082
- I just had to take
everything away,


431
00:27:50.084 --> 00:27:51.518
to try and get him clean.

432
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.819
- We're here by accident really.

433
00:27:53.821 --> 00:27:56.889
I just went to a chip
shop, saw a leaflet,


434
00:27:56.891 --> 00:27:59.091
and she was adamant
that we had to come.


435
00:27:59.093 --> 00:28:01.727
- So, we jumped on a train,

436
00:28:01.729 --> 00:28:04.630
and we came to see what
all the fuss is about.


437
00:28:04.632 --> 00:28:06.298
- Yaz seems to think that
we can travel forever,


438
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:09.703
but I know that it's just to
get away from my bad habits.


439
00:28:11.572 --> 00:28:13.040
- And to get away from grief.

440
00:28:14.108 --> 00:28:17.011
(flames crackling)

441
00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:22.948
- Well, that got deep real fast.

442
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.551
- But thank you
for being honest.


443
00:28:24.553 --> 00:28:26.555
It really does
make a difference.


444
00:28:28.756 --> 00:28:32.191
So, Maria, can you
tell us a little


445
00:28:32.193 --> 00:28:33.428
something about yourself?

446
00:28:34.662 --> 00:28:35.627
- What do you wanna know?

447
00:28:35.629 --> 00:28:36.465
- Anything.

448
00:28:37.698 --> 00:28:39.665
- There's not
really much to say.


449
00:28:39.667 --> 00:28:40.768
- There's no pressure.

450
00:28:41.735 --> 00:28:44.002
(flames crackling)

451
00:28:44.004 --> 00:28:46.038
- So, were you
already traveling,


452
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.309
or did you come here especially?

453
00:28:50.077 --> 00:28:53.278
- Um, especially, I guess.

454
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.080
- Now that's surprising.

455
00:28:55.082 --> 00:28:56.281
- Is it?

456
00:28:56.283 --> 00:28:57.550
Why?

457
00:28:57.552 --> 00:29:00.154
- Well, it's not exactly
an easy place to get to.


458
00:29:01.322 --> 00:29:02.990
- It's no harder
than Disneyland.


459
00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:07.292
- Yeah, but there's
no magic here.


460
00:29:07.294 --> 00:29:08.961
- Okay, why'd you go?

461
00:29:08.963 --> 00:29:09.864
- It's what we do.

462
00:29:12.766 --> 00:29:15.801
Why was Oliver accompanying you?

463
00:29:15.803 --> 00:29:18.404
(flames crackling)

464
00:29:18.406 --> 00:29:19.872
- We're a couple.

465
00:29:19.874 --> 00:29:22.774
We do things for each
other as well as ourselves.


466
00:29:22.776 --> 00:29:24.611
- So this was all
on your accord?


467
00:29:24.613 --> 00:29:26.111
- No.

468
00:29:26.113 --> 00:29:28.816
Well, I think he
liked the idea too.


469
00:29:30.284 --> 00:29:33.085
He recently lost his job,
so I thought this would be


470
00:29:33.087 --> 00:29:34.286
a good place for him to get

471
00:29:34.288 --> 00:29:36.290
his creative juices
flowing again, I guess.


472
00:29:37.324 --> 00:29:38.593
- As good a place as any.

473
00:29:40.161 --> 00:29:42.129
- Can we stop now please?

474
00:29:42.997 --> 00:29:43.962
- Just one more--

475
00:29:43.964 --> 00:29:45.731
- No, I said, can we stop?

476
00:29:45.733 --> 00:29:49.902
- Well, we, really should
get the full story.


477
00:29:49.904 --> 00:29:52.840
(flames crackling)

478
00:29:57.244 --> 00:29:58.078
- Fine.

479
00:29:59.447 --> 00:30:03.418
Um, my family always
knew about this place.


480
00:30:04.653 --> 00:30:06.185
I always felt like an outsider.

481
00:30:06.187 --> 00:30:07.686
I didn't really
know much about it,


482
00:30:07.688 --> 00:30:10.423
so I came here to
start bridging the gap.


483
00:30:10.425 --> 00:30:13.125
- Ah, I know exactly
what you mean.


484
00:30:13.127 --> 00:30:15.194
My family are a nightmare.

485
00:30:15.196 --> 00:30:18.030
If it's not about sport,
they're not interested.


486
00:30:18.032 --> 00:30:22.402
- We did this first series
about the ghost of George Best.


487
00:30:22.404 --> 00:30:25.272
- And even that couldn't
spark a conversation.


488
00:30:27.576 --> 00:30:29.544
- You got what you
need? Can I go now?


489
00:30:30.711 --> 00:30:31.810
- They've heard more
than I ever have.


490
00:30:31.812 --> 00:30:32.980
- Oliver, just not now.

491
00:30:34.114 --> 00:30:35.584
- [Courtney] Sure,
thanks, Maria.


492
00:30:39.621 --> 00:30:42.089
(Yaz sobbing)

493
00:30:46.093 --> 00:30:48.663
(wind blowing)

494
00:30:51.298 --> 00:30:54.266
(rain tapping)

495
00:30:54.268 --> 00:30:57.437
- Dan, just do it
tomorrow. Come to bed.


496
00:30:57.439 --> 00:30:58.239
- Sh.

497
00:30:59.106 --> 00:31:00.640
Oh.

498
00:31:00.642 --> 00:31:01.610
I'm working.

499
00:31:03.077 --> 00:31:07.346
- I can't sleep with you
tip tapping next to me.


500
00:31:07.348 --> 00:31:10.084
- Just roll over
and go to sleep.


501
00:31:12.554 --> 00:31:16.288
(Courtney sighing)

502
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.491
Mature. Real mature.

503
00:31:18.493 --> 00:31:21.095
(rain tapping)

504
00:31:24.865 --> 00:31:27.467
(Courtney sighing)

505
00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:29.835
(wind whistling)

506
00:31:29.837 --> 00:31:32.940
(gentle piano music)

507
00:31:35.276 --> 00:31:37.644
(stream running)

508
00:31:37.646 --> 00:31:40.715
(gentle piano music)

509
00:31:41.815 --> 00:31:44.149
(birds calling)

510
00:31:44.151 --> 00:31:47.187
(gentle piano music)

511
00:32:06.206 --> 00:32:09.611
(soft suspenseful music)

512
00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.232
(water flowing)

513
00:32:34.234 --> 00:32:37.672
(soft suspenseful music)

514
00:32:38.872 --> 00:32:40.874
- [Girl] I want my doll.

515
00:32:43.877 --> 00:32:47.816
- Backwoods Brutality.
That's a shit name.


516
00:32:49.049 --> 00:32:51.586
(rain tapping)

517
00:32:53.588 --> 00:32:56.223
(Jake exhaling)

518
00:33:02.363 --> 00:33:05.631
(tent unzipping)

519
00:33:05.633 --> 00:33:07.099
Is that you, Yaz?

520
00:33:07.101 --> 00:33:09.537
(soft music)

521
00:33:10.938 --> 00:33:13.506
Yaz, it, look, if you're gonna
moan at me about smoking,


522
00:33:13.508 --> 00:33:14.574
I'm just gonna finish this one.

523
00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:15.943
You know it helps me sleep.

524
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:19.647
(tent unzipping)

525
00:33:21.014 --> 00:33:21.850
It's you.

526
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:24.249
Wait, just ...

527
00:33:24.251 --> 00:33:27.321
(upbeat piano music)

528
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:31.156
Wait!

529
00:33:31.158 --> 00:33:34.261
(upbeat piano music)

530
00:33:43.405 --> 00:33:44.606
Where are you taking us?

531
00:33:45.874 --> 00:33:46.940
- To meet my friends.

532
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:50.177
- Where are your friends?

533
00:33:51.646 --> 00:33:54.212
- They're everywhere.

534
00:33:54.214 --> 00:33:56.316
- Can't see anyone.
Why are they hiding?


535
00:33:59.153 --> 00:34:01.119
- I don't know.

536
00:34:01.121 --> 00:34:03.792
(twig snapping)

537
00:34:04.958 --> 00:34:05.926
- Where did you go?

538
00:34:07.395 --> 00:34:11.564
- (giggles) I'm
right here, silly.


539
00:34:11.566 --> 00:34:13.399
(upbeat piano music)

540
00:34:13.401 --> 00:34:15.333
- Fuck this, I've
had enough of this.


541
00:34:15.335 --> 00:34:18.005
(Jake groaning)

542
00:34:21.175 --> 00:34:23.845
(Jake coughing)

543
00:34:28.248 --> 00:34:30.583
(Jake coughing)

544
00:34:30.585 --> 00:34:33.251
(soft music)

545
00:34:33.253 --> 00:34:36.023
(waves crashing)

546
00:34:42.129 --> 00:34:43.696
- [Courtney] I just can't
believe the material


547
00:34:43.698 --> 00:34:44.996
we got last night.

548
00:34:44.998 --> 00:34:47.733
- I know. Our
subscribers'll be ecstatic.


549
00:34:47.735 --> 00:34:51.637
- Forget about the
old subscribers.
Think of the new ones.


550
00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:54.807
Then those trolls'll stop
leaving those negative comments.


551
00:34:54.809 --> 00:34:57.211
- Hold on now, we still
got a lot of work to do.


552
00:35:01.114 --> 00:35:01.950
- Hi.

553
00:35:05.352 --> 00:35:06.985
Um, about last night?

554
00:35:06.987 --> 00:35:11.491
- Uh, don't worry about
it. It was our fault.


555
00:35:11.493 --> 00:35:13.459
- We shouldn't have
pushed so hard.


556
00:35:13.461 --> 00:35:17.295
It's just this job, it
makes us seem a little ...


557
00:35:17.297 --> 00:35:18.131
- Inconsiderate.

558
00:35:19.868 --> 00:35:21.068
- It won't happen again.

559
00:35:22.604 --> 00:35:23.438
- Thanks.

560
00:35:25.105 --> 00:35:27.874
(Maria clearing throat)

561
00:35:27.876 --> 00:35:30.545
(water rushing)

562
00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:33.278
(birds singing)

563
00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:34.680
Have you seen the others?

564
00:35:34.682 --> 00:35:38.384
- Um, Oliver's
taking photographs.


565
00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:40.453
Jake's in bed?

566
00:35:40.455 --> 00:35:41.723
And Yaz,

567
00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:44.859
I don't know where Yaz is.

568
00:35:46.728 --> 00:35:47.960
- Right, thanks.

569
00:35:47.962 --> 00:35:50.730
I'll leave you to
your work then.


570
00:35:50.732 --> 00:35:53.933
(water rushing)

571
00:35:53.935 --> 00:35:56.604
(birds singing)

572
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:01.908
(birds singing)

573
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.646
(stream running)

574
00:36:15.423 --> 00:36:16.889
- Hm. Oh, morning.

575
00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:18.558
Hi, do you wanna join me?

576
00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:23.529
- Um, sure. What
exactly are you doing?


577
00:36:23.531 --> 00:36:25.965
- I'm just looking for like
watercress or wild garlic


578
00:36:25.967 --> 00:36:27.533
or something we can cook.

579
00:36:27.535 --> 00:36:29.134
Come on.

580
00:36:29.136 --> 00:36:31.806
(water lapping)

581
00:36:35.977 --> 00:36:37.175
Have you seen Jake yet today?

582
00:36:37.177 --> 00:36:39.311
- No, I haven't. I'm sorry.

583
00:36:39.313 --> 00:36:41.047
- He is so lazy.

584
00:36:41.049 --> 00:36:42.582
Do you know, we went
to Paris recently,


585
00:36:42.584 --> 00:36:45.685
and he literally sat the whole
day and the Louvre closed?


586
00:36:45.687 --> 00:36:48.054
- Yeah, I don't know
how you deal with him.


587
00:36:48.056 --> 00:36:51.457
(stream running)

588
00:36:51.459 --> 00:36:52.292
- Yeah.

589
00:36:54.395 --> 00:36:56.562
How was last night in the end?

590
00:36:56.564 --> 00:36:59.500
- Yeah, fine, nothing
really happened.


591
00:37:01.002 --> 00:37:02.668
Nothing happened.

592
00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:06.104
- Did the pods pressure you
for more than they deserve?


593
00:37:06.106 --> 00:37:07.740
- Mm.

594
00:37:07.742 --> 00:37:09.207
- Oh, just ignore them.

595
00:37:09.209 --> 00:37:11.777
I mean, I know they're
irritating, but realistically


596
00:37:11.779 --> 00:37:13.946
it's probably better
that we're in a group.


597
00:37:13.948 --> 00:37:15.848
I mean, imagine how
super creepy this place


598
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:17.016
would be on your own.

599
00:37:17.018 --> 00:37:20.151
- I mean it is
still super creepy.


600
00:37:20.153 --> 00:37:21.219
- Yeah.

601
00:37:21.221 --> 00:37:23.789
(stream running)

602
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:25.458
Have you heard the
stories about this place?


603
00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.426
- What stories?

604
00:37:27.428 --> 00:37:30.765
- About Adrian, the
doll, his death.


605
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.866
- Psst.

606
00:37:33.868 --> 00:37:36.604
(stream running)

607
00:37:48.783 --> 00:37:49.884
I hate this lens.

608
00:37:51.786 --> 00:37:54.854
(soft suspenseful music)

609
00:37:54.856 --> 00:37:57.592
(stream running)

610
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:07.035
What the fuck?

611
00:38:08.201 --> 00:38:09.334
- Personally, I think
Adrian was probably


612
00:38:09.336 --> 00:38:11.837
just mad or something.

613
00:38:11.839 --> 00:38:13.306
I don't really buy it.

614
00:38:14.942 --> 00:38:17.543
- Oh well, we probably shouldn't
really jump to conclusions


615
00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:19.344
without knowing the
truth, you know.


616
00:38:19.346 --> 00:38:20.980
- Yeah, but if people
are gonna make up stories


617
00:38:20.982 --> 00:38:22.415
about an island of dolls,

618
00:38:22.417 --> 00:38:25.316
people are gonna jump
to conclusions, right?


619
00:38:25.318 --> 00:38:26.786
- Yeah.

620
00:38:26.788 --> 00:38:28.754
- I mean apparently, this
girl's body washed up


621
00:38:28.756 --> 00:38:31.123
in the canal, and
Adrian found it.


622
00:38:31.125 --> 00:38:34.627
And then in 2001,
Adrian's body washed up


623
00:38:34.629 --> 00:38:36.495
in the same spot in the canal.

624
00:38:36.497 --> 00:38:37.330
Weird, right?

625
00:38:38.533 --> 00:38:42.202
- Mm, like I said, who
knows what to believe?


626
00:38:43.471 --> 00:38:44.937
- Yeah, I guess.

627
00:38:44.939 --> 00:38:48.273
(stream running)

628
00:38:48.275 --> 00:38:50.910
(birds singing)

629
00:38:50.912 --> 00:38:53.681
(stream running)

630
00:38:57.719 --> 00:39:01.055
(soft suspenseful music)

631
00:39:05.026 --> 00:39:06.461
I think that doll just moved.

632
00:39:07.962 --> 00:39:10.230
- It's just a doll.
Probably nothing.


633
00:39:11.298 --> 00:39:12.133
- What was that?

634
00:39:16.104 --> 00:39:16.938
- Yeah.

635
00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:19.505
- Come on, let's go.

636
00:39:19.507 --> 00:39:22.508
(soft suspenseful music)

637
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.278
(stream running)

638
00:39:27.215 --> 00:39:28.981
(water lapping)

639
00:39:28.983 --> 00:39:31.450
(Yaz shrieking)

640
00:39:31.452 --> 00:39:32.285
- Yaz!

641
00:39:33.721 --> 00:39:35.223
- Take my hand, quick!

642
00:39:36.657 --> 00:39:39.326
(Yaz shrieking)

643
00:39:40.428 --> 00:39:41.694
You okay?

644
00:39:41.696 --> 00:39:42.628
- No.

645
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.765
(soft suspenseful music)

646
00:39:45.767 --> 00:39:48.436
(waves lapping)

647
00:39:53.306 --> 00:39:54.707
- Right.

648
00:39:54.709 --> 00:39:56.544
- It's okay, I'm here.

649
00:39:57.912 --> 00:39:59.180
- Have you seen Jake yet?

650
00:40:01.449 --> 00:40:03.484
- No. Should we see
if he's in his tent?


651
00:40:05.086 --> 00:40:06.685
Yeah?

652
00:40:06.687 --> 00:40:09.889
Oliver, can you just see if
Jake's in his tent please?


653
00:40:09.891 --> 00:40:10.723
- Yeah, sure.

654
00:40:10.725 --> 00:40:12.258
- He's not in there.

655
00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.425
When you guys were out earlier,

656
00:40:13.427 --> 00:40:15.027
he decided to go out for a walk.

657
00:40:15.029 --> 00:40:17.965
- Uh, yeah, said he needed to
clear his head or something.


658
00:40:19.133 --> 00:40:20.601
- Okay, thanks.

659
00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:25.437
(birds singing)

660
00:40:25.439 --> 00:40:28.440
I think it's time that I
was honest with you all.


661
00:40:28.442 --> 00:40:29.277
- About what?

662
00:40:32.379 --> 00:40:34.814
- Why I'm here.

663
00:40:34.816 --> 00:40:37.616
(flames crackling)

664
00:40:37.618 --> 00:40:41.520
(soft suspenseful music)

665
00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:43.424
- Are you sure you
want to do this?


666
00:40:44.324 --> 00:40:46.792
(soft music)

667
00:40:46.794 --> 00:40:51.065
- Yeah, I should have been
truthful from the start.


668
00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:56.367
- Right, so you ready
to go? I'm rolling.


669
00:40:56.369 --> 00:40:57.505
- Ready when you are.

670
00:40:59.273 --> 00:41:01.807
(soft piano music)

671
00:41:01.809 --> 00:41:04.143
- Well, it's like I said before.

672
00:41:04.145 --> 00:41:07.213
My family have always
known about place.


673
00:41:07.215 --> 00:41:09.349
My grandfather, he
used to live nearby.


674
00:41:11.052 --> 00:41:13.018
Whenever my mother
and I would visit,


675
00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:14.522
he would tell us about Adrian.

676
00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:18.157
(soft piano music)

677
00:41:18.159 --> 00:41:20.292
He would tell us to
stay away from him.


678
00:41:20.294 --> 00:41:21.660
And we did.

679
00:41:21.662 --> 00:41:24.432
But we'd often see him
around and in passing.


680
00:41:26.067 --> 00:41:29.702
Despite finding loads of
the dolls in the canals,


681
00:41:29.704 --> 00:41:32.004
he'd often go into the town.

682
00:41:32.006 --> 00:41:34.540
Some of the poorer
families, they would trade


683
00:41:34.542 --> 00:41:37.443
their old dolls for crops
they would grow on the island.


684
00:41:37.445 --> 00:41:39.678
- Are you getting this?

685
00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:42.416
- From what I was told,
Adrian was a preacher


686
00:41:43.784 --> 00:41:47.119
but at the time only anointed
priests could preach,


687
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:48.754
so his practice
was not appreciated


688
00:41:48.756 --> 00:41:50.124
by the Catholic communities.

689
00:41:51.592 --> 00:41:53.661
Apparently, he used
to get attacked a lot.


690
00:41:55.129 --> 00:41:58.900
His family pleaded with him
to stop but he never did.


691
00:41:59.934 --> 00:42:01.834
Some say that's what drove him

692
00:42:01.836 --> 00:42:04.203
to the island in
the first place.


693
00:42:04.205 --> 00:42:07.006
He was seeking
sanctuary from a place


694
00:42:07.008 --> 00:42:08.676
that he was never
really welcome in.


695
00:42:09.911 --> 00:42:11.577
- What's this have to
do with you, Maria?


696
00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:12.847
- Let her talk.

697
00:42:14.448 --> 00:42:16.649
- [Maria] Well, tours
of the island started


698
00:42:16.651 --> 00:42:18.751
when Adrian was still alive.

699
00:42:18.753 --> 00:42:20.586
He would take people
around in exchange


700
00:42:20.588 --> 00:42:23.489
for a donation when his
crops were struggling.


701
00:42:23.491 --> 00:42:26.227
- So, that just about brings
us to the end of the tour.


702
00:42:27.695 --> 00:42:28.930
Are there any questions?

703
00:42:30.264 --> 00:42:32.300
- [Tourist] How many
dolls are on the island?


704
00:42:33.367 --> 00:42:35.100
- Well, that's a great question.

705
00:42:35.102 --> 00:42:36.504
Probably,

706
00:42:38.072 --> 00:42:40.739
you know, I've been
collecting for a long time.


707
00:42:40.741 --> 00:42:43.008
I think about a
thousand five hundred.


708
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.844
Give or take.

709
00:42:45.313 --> 00:42:46.912
Do you have any questions?

710
00:42:46.914 --> 00:42:48.649
Oh, someone in the
back there, hi.


711
00:42:50.084 --> 00:42:52.351
- [Tourist] Does anyone
live on the island?


712
00:42:52.353 --> 00:42:56.389
- Well, it's, believe
it or not, it's just me.


713
00:42:56.391 --> 00:43:00.059
The island was, it was
empty when I found it.


714
00:43:00.061 --> 00:43:02.695
A strange little story,
which I don't wanna


715
00:43:02.697 --> 00:43:04.964
get into right now, but,

716
00:43:04.966 --> 00:43:06.600
yeah, the island
was pretty much,


717
00:43:07.802 --> 00:43:09.402
pretty much alone
like me in life.


718
00:43:09.404 --> 00:43:14.409
So the dolls washed up, and
I've collected as I've gone.


719
00:43:15.776 --> 00:43:16.877
And here we are today.

720
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.881
We had a little one right there.

721
00:43:22.384 --> 00:43:23.983
- [Maria] On one of our
visits, my mother decided


722
00:43:23.985 --> 00:43:26.085
that she wanted to go on one.

723
00:43:26.087 --> 00:43:28.087
She wanted to get her own
perspective on the man


724
00:43:28.089 --> 00:43:30.423
and the situation,
rather than taking rumors


725
00:43:30.425 --> 00:43:32.059
and conspiracies as the truth.

726
00:43:33.395 --> 00:43:35.594
She decided to take me with her.

727
00:43:35.596 --> 00:43:37.730
I think she thought
I'd like the dolls.


728
00:43:37.732 --> 00:43:38.998
Which I did.

729
00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.232
But I don't think
she realized what


730
00:43:40.234 --> 00:43:41.602
the island would look like.

731
00:43:42.737 --> 00:43:45.840
(gentle piano music)

732
00:43:48.175 --> 00:43:50.911
(stream running)

733
00:43:51.912 --> 00:43:54.947
- Where is this going, Maria?

734
00:43:54.949 --> 00:43:56.081
- I'm getting there.

735
00:43:56.083 --> 00:43:56.915
- It's okay.

736
00:43:56.917 --> 00:43:57.785
Take your time.

737
00:43:58.953 --> 00:43:59.754
I'm here.

738
00:44:00.755 --> 00:44:01.555
- Thanks.

739
00:44:04.825 --> 00:44:06.759
- [Adrian] Thanks
very much for coming.


740
00:44:06.761 --> 00:44:07.595
- Thank you.

741
00:44:08.497 --> 00:44:10.362
Take care of yourself.

742
00:44:10.364 --> 00:44:12.299
- Thank you.
- Thank you, thanks.


743
00:44:13.667 --> 00:44:16.101
(stream running)

744
00:44:16.103 --> 00:44:19.271
(birds singing)

745
00:44:19.273 --> 00:44:21.006
- What's the matter?

746
00:44:21.008 --> 00:44:23.342
(stream running)

747
00:44:23.344 --> 00:44:24.743
- Excuse me?

748
00:44:24.745 --> 00:44:26.446
- You seem sad.

749
00:44:26.448 --> 00:44:28.013
- What makes you say that?

750
00:44:28.015 --> 00:44:29.982
- No one should be sad.

751
00:44:29.984 --> 00:44:32.753
(stream running)

752
00:44:33.854 --> 00:44:35.721
- And what's your name?

753
00:44:35.723 --> 00:44:36.557
- Maria.

754
00:44:37.725 --> 00:44:39.892
- Well that's a very
nice name, Maria.


755
00:44:39.894 --> 00:44:40.995
Do you like the dolls?

756
00:44:41.896 --> 00:44:44.129
(stream running)

757
00:44:44.131 --> 00:44:47.232
They used to belong to a
little girl I once knew.


758
00:44:47.234 --> 00:44:49.068
- What was her name?

759
00:44:49.070 --> 00:44:50.836
- [Adult Maria] At that
moment, it was as if


760
00:44:50.838 --> 00:44:53.238
I could sense his emotions.

761
00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.841
Hopeless, yet hopeful.

762
00:44:55.843 --> 00:44:58.779
Suddenly all of the stories
felt real, yet wrong.


763
00:44:59.747 --> 00:45:00.881
I've never forgotten it.

764
00:45:02.116 --> 00:45:04.349
Adrian was anything but lost.

765
00:45:04.351 --> 00:45:07.686
He felt obligated to the
land, to the young girl,


766
00:45:07.688 --> 00:45:09.857
but it's clear he missed
who he was before.


767
00:45:11.025 --> 00:45:12.461
- Would you like
one of the dolls?


768
00:45:13.594 --> 00:45:14.993
(soft music)

769
00:45:14.995 --> 00:45:18.230
Would you like to have that one?

770
00:45:18.232 --> 00:45:19.066
Here.

771
00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.439
I'd like you to have this one.

772
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.474
- [Adult Maria] I've never
forgotten that moment.


773
00:45:27.476 --> 00:45:30.008
I was lucky enough to
see who he really was


774
00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:32.646
and have the specter that
others never experienced.


775
00:45:33.614 --> 00:45:35.380
(soft music)

776
00:45:35.382 --> 00:45:38.185
- [Mother] Maria, get over
here now. The boat's leaving.


777
00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:42.723
(stream running)

778
00:45:43.991 --> 00:45:45.525
- Ever since that moment,

779
00:45:45.527 --> 00:45:47.596
I've been having dreams
about the island.


780
00:45:49.564 --> 00:45:51.265
Hearing the voice
of a young girl,


781
00:45:52.233 --> 00:45:54.201
pleading for her doll back,

782
00:45:55.836 --> 00:46:00.774
I also hear the
voices of the dolls


783
00:46:01.976 --> 00:46:04.943
and I have dreams about
the island, dolls in it.


784
00:46:04.945 --> 00:46:06.147
It's turbulent past.

785
00:46:08.583 --> 00:46:10.949
- We're going viral with this.

786
00:46:10.951 --> 00:46:12.251
- Way, honey, way.

787
00:46:12.253 --> 00:46:13.852
(stream running)

788
00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:15.187
- What aren't you telling us?

789
00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:16.955
- She's said enough.

790
00:46:16.957 --> 00:46:17.890
(stream running)

791
00:46:17.892 --> 00:46:19.494
- There's more, isn't there?

792
00:46:20.629 --> 00:46:22.495
- I mean, to be
honest, we were here


793
00:46:22.497 --> 00:46:24.963
before you guys
even arrived and,


794
00:46:24.965 --> 00:46:27.935
back then the island
was peaceful and quiet.


795
00:46:28.836 --> 00:46:30.503
- Kind of boring, to be honest.

796
00:46:30.505 --> 00:46:34.607
- But, since you arrived,
something's changed.


797
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:37.142
It's like something's awakened.

798
00:46:37.144 --> 00:46:38.844
- Somebody died.

799
00:46:38.846 --> 00:46:40.679
- What are you talking about?

800
00:46:40.681 --> 00:46:42.349
- Maria, what do
you know about this?


801
00:46:43.418 --> 00:46:46.818
(stream running)

802
00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:47.721
- What's happened?

803
00:46:49.457 --> 00:46:50.291
Tell me.

804
00:46:52.527 --> 00:46:54.193
- Play it for her, Dan.

805
00:46:54.195 --> 00:46:55.827
- You sure about this?

806
00:46:55.829 --> 00:46:57.763
- Play me what?

807
00:46:57.765 --> 00:46:58.600
- Okay.

808
00:47:00.402 --> 00:47:01.900
Going to need these.

809
00:47:01.902 --> 00:47:04.639
(stream running)

810
00:47:07.576 --> 00:47:09.908
(birds singing)

811
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:13.314
(soft suspenseful music)

812
00:47:22.289 --> 00:47:24.591
(Yaz screaming)

813
00:47:24.593 --> 00:47:28.260
(soft suspenseful music)

814
00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:30.931
(birds singing)

815
00:47:34.935 --> 00:47:37.672
(water rumbling)

816
00:47:43.445 --> 00:47:46.345
- I think the recording
device picked up


817
00:47:46.347 --> 00:47:48.483
the screams from
somewhere over here.


818
00:47:49.551 --> 00:47:51.384
- This is wrong, Dan.

819
00:47:51.386 --> 00:47:53.018
- We couldn't have stopped it.

820
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.355
- Maybe we shoulda tried.

821
00:47:55.789 --> 00:47:58.292
- Our job is to observe the
action, not become the action.


822
00:47:59.193 --> 00:48:00.859
- Well look what's happened.

823
00:48:00.861 --> 00:48:05.598
- This isn't on us.

824
00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.165
- Yaz, try to keep up.

825
00:48:07.167 --> 00:48:08.536
- How much further is it?

826
00:48:09.571 --> 00:48:11.404
(soft suspenseful music)

827
00:48:11.406 --> 00:48:12.572
Let me through.

828
00:48:12.574 --> 00:48:13.406
- No, you don't--

829
00:48:13.408 --> 00:48:15.441
- I need through.

830
00:48:15.443 --> 00:48:18.010
(Yaz screaming)

831
00:48:18.012 --> 00:48:21.313
(soft suspenseful music)

832
00:48:21.315 --> 00:48:23.716
(Yaz crying)

833
00:48:23.718 --> 00:48:27.154
(soft suspenseful music)

834
00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:30.789
- Do you hear that?

835
00:48:30.791 --> 00:48:31.792
- Hear what?

836
00:48:34.094 --> 00:48:35.360
Dan, what is it?

837
00:48:35.362 --> 00:48:36.261
(girl laughing)

838
00:48:36.263 --> 00:48:37.996
- There it is again.

839
00:48:37.998 --> 00:48:40.365
I think it's come from this way.

840
00:48:40.367 --> 00:48:44.303
(soft suspenseful music)

841
00:48:44.305 --> 00:48:46.807
(Yaz wailing)

842
00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:54.079
- Yaz, I'll come back for
you, I promise. I just ...


843
00:48:54.081 --> 00:48:55.517
I need to see where Dan went.

844
00:48:57.084 --> 00:48:57.951
I'm so sorry.

845
00:49:01.855 --> 00:49:04.626
(stream running)

846
00:49:09.397 --> 00:49:10.230
Dan?

847
00:49:12.366 --> 00:49:13.433
Where are you?

848
00:49:13.435 --> 00:49:16.170
(stream running)

849
00:49:18.238 --> 00:49:21.641
Observe the action.
Don't become the action.


850
00:49:21.643 --> 00:49:23.141
(stream running)

851
00:49:23.143 --> 00:49:27.547
Observe the action.
Don't become the action.


852
00:49:27.549 --> 00:49:28.382
Dan?

853
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.884
Are you there?

854
00:49:31.985 --> 00:49:33.455
- [Girl] He's here.
I can see him.


855
00:49:34.556 --> 00:49:35.755
- Who's that?

856
00:49:35.757 --> 00:49:38.290
(soft suspenseful music)

857
00:49:38.292 --> 00:49:39.126
Who's that?

858
00:49:41.862 --> 00:49:43.030
Tell me where Dan is.

859
00:49:44.164 --> 00:49:46.066
- [Girl] I can take you
to him, if you like.


860
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:49.604
- At what expense?

861
00:49:51.639 --> 00:49:53.271
- [Girl] Nothing.

862
00:49:53.273 --> 00:49:54.542
- Stop playing games.

863
00:49:55.976 --> 00:49:57.579
- [Girl] I didn't realize
you were playing a game.


864
00:49:59.313 --> 00:50:00.147
- We're not.

865
00:50:01.683 --> 00:50:02.484
Nor will I.

866
00:50:03.884 --> 00:50:05.820
- [Girl] It's too late.

867
00:50:07.789 --> 00:50:09.422
- Observe the action.

868
00:50:09.424 --> 00:50:12.827
(soft suspenseful music)

869
00:50:21.836 --> 00:50:23.203
This is Courtney speaking.

870
00:50:24.706 --> 00:50:28.039
I'm deep in the woods on
The Island of the Dolls.


871
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:30.410
(girl laughing)

872
00:50:30.412 --> 00:50:33.311
(soft suspenseful music)

873
00:50:33.313 --> 00:50:35.180
I can hear the voice
of a little girl.


874
00:50:35.182 --> 00:50:37.650
(birds calling)

875
00:50:37.652 --> 00:50:39.019
It's as if she surrounds me.

876
00:50:40.988 --> 00:50:42.855
- [Girl] Wanna play?

877
00:50:42.857 --> 00:50:45.658
(soft suspenseful music)

878
00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:47.928
- She seems to be trying
to lead me somewhere.


879
00:50:50.364 --> 00:50:53.200
I'm going to follow
along in an attempt to


880
00:50:54.469 --> 00:50:55.934
observe the action.

881
00:50:55.936 --> 00:50:59.306
(soft suspenseful music)

882
00:51:01.543 --> 00:51:06.548
- [Girl] Hello.

883
00:51:07.715 --> 00:51:10.652
- There's something
new about the island.


884
00:51:11.886 --> 00:51:14.387
As if it's truly come alive.

885
00:51:14.389 --> 00:51:17.392
(suspenseful music)

886
00:51:18.258 --> 00:51:19.092
The dolls.

887
00:51:20.562 --> 00:51:24.296
I feel like they're watching
me, which isn't an experience


888
00:51:24.298 --> 00:51:26.266
I've felt since
arriving at the island.


889
00:51:27.367 --> 00:51:29.702
(soft suspenseful music)

890
00:51:29.704 --> 00:51:31.439
I don't know if
you can hear that.


891
00:51:32.907 --> 00:51:34.409
But the wind, it's,

892
00:51:35.543 --> 00:51:38.945
it's like it's hail
razors against the ears,


893
00:51:38.947 --> 00:51:43.217
hitting against me,
and it's familiar yet


894
00:51:44.819 --> 00:51:46.017
supernatural.

895
00:51:46.019 --> 00:51:49.422
(soft suspenseful music)

896
00:51:49.424 --> 00:51:50.224
The dolls.

897
00:51:52.326 --> 00:51:53.126
They've moved.

898
00:51:54.127 --> 00:51:56.796
(soft suspenseful music)

899
00:51:56.798 --> 00:51:59.333
(girl calling)

900
00:52:00.267 --> 00:52:03.034
(soft suspenseful music)

901
00:52:03.036 --> 00:52:04.539
- [Girl] Love her.

902
00:52:07.942 --> 00:52:10.375
- Wait. Come back here!

903
00:52:10.377 --> 00:52:13.245
(soft suspenseful music)

904
00:52:13.247 --> 00:52:14.480
- [Girl] Love her.

905
00:52:14.482 --> 00:52:17.919
(soft suspenseful music)

906
00:52:22.222 --> 00:52:24.557
(twigs snapping)

907
00:52:24.559 --> 00:52:27.495
Hello.

908
00:52:30.197 --> 00:52:32.567
- As of yet, I'm
still to find Dan.


909
00:52:35.503 --> 00:52:37.304
I fear we may have
gotten too close.


910
00:52:40.675 --> 00:52:43.174
The island is growing
in its energy.


911
00:52:43.176 --> 00:52:44.610
(bird cawing)

912
00:52:44.612 --> 00:52:46.211
And it's haunting.

913
00:52:46.213 --> 00:52:49.314
(stream running)

914
00:52:49.316 --> 00:52:52.385
(girl calling)

915
00:52:52.387 --> 00:52:54.754
This has gone on
for long enough!


916
00:52:54.756 --> 00:52:56.556
(suspenseful music)

917
00:52:56.558 --> 00:52:57.957
- [Girl] Hello.

918
00:52:57.959 --> 00:53:00.862
(suspenseful music)

919
00:53:01.996 --> 00:53:04.195
- I'm in pursuit of the
little girl's voice.


920
00:53:04.197 --> 00:53:07.200
(suspenseful music)

921
00:53:08.570 --> 00:53:10.705
I can sense it. I'm
getting closer to her.


922
00:53:12.607 --> 00:53:14.374
And hopefully to Dan.

923
00:53:16.076 --> 00:53:18.680
(girl calling)

924
00:53:21.214 --> 00:53:22.247
- [Girl] Hello.

925
00:53:22.249 --> 00:53:25.252
(suspenseful music)

926
00:53:45.873 --> 00:53:48.443
(both gasping)

927
00:53:52.847 --> 00:53:54.513
- Dan.

928
00:53:54.515 --> 00:53:56.951
(soft music)

929
00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.721
- Honey.

930
00:54:03.357 --> 00:54:06.293
- [Girl] You found
each other, yay!


931
00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:10.830
(bodies thudding)

932
00:54:10.832 --> 00:54:13.601
(stream running)

933
00:54:17.739 --> 00:54:20.675
(leaves crunching)

934
00:54:23.044 --> 00:54:24.545
- Wish I brought marshmallows.

935
00:54:26.447 --> 00:54:28.648
(birds cawing)

936
00:54:28.650 --> 00:54:31.419
(stream running)

937
00:54:37.224 --> 00:54:39.492
(soft piano music)

938
00:54:39.494 --> 00:54:42.895
What are we even doing here?

939
00:54:42.897 --> 00:54:45.066
You never told me about
any of this, Maria.


940
00:54:46.199 --> 00:54:48.233
How do you think
that makes me feel?


941
00:54:48.235 --> 00:54:50.772
I would do anything to make
you feel better, Maria.


942
00:54:51.806 --> 00:54:54.106
(soft piano music)

943
00:54:54.108 --> 00:54:56.809
Why do you think that I
can't help you with the past?


944
00:54:56.811 --> 00:54:57.943
Why didn't you think that ...

945
00:54:57.945 --> 00:55:00.247
- Oliver, please, just stop.

946
00:55:02.650 --> 00:55:05.053
Look, one of these days
you need to realize that


947
00:55:06.219 --> 00:55:08.255
just because we're in
a relationship, it,


948
00:55:09.424 --> 00:55:12.794
it doesn't mean that you
own every ounce of me.


949
00:55:13.995 --> 00:55:16.497
It isn't to stop me
being an individual.


950
00:55:17.699 --> 00:55:18.766
Some things can,

951
00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.401
some things can still be mine.

952
00:55:22.403 --> 00:55:25.173
(stream running)

953
00:55:26.941 --> 00:55:30.576
- I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to sound insensitive.


954
00:55:30.578 --> 00:55:33.979
(stream running)

955
00:55:33.981 --> 00:55:37.416
- It's fine.

956
00:55:37.418 --> 00:55:39.387
It's fine. I get it.

957
00:55:42.222 --> 00:55:44.957
I don't want you to feel
like you have to walk


958
00:55:44.959 --> 00:55:47.028
on eggshells every
time you're around me.


959
00:55:48.062 --> 00:55:49.395
Because you don't.

960
00:55:49.397 --> 00:55:52.064
(soft piano music)

961
00:55:52.066 --> 00:55:53.735
But you've gotta
understand that,


962
00:55:54.736 --> 00:55:57.636
that I am who I am, okay?

963
00:55:57.638 --> 00:55:58.873
With or without you.

964
00:56:00.307 --> 00:56:04.178
And that, that doesn't make
you entitled to all of me,


965
00:56:05.079 --> 00:56:06.948
only what I choose to share.

966
00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.349
- How do you expect to
have a proper relationship


967
00:56:11.351 --> 00:56:13.154
when all you do is
live in the past?


968
00:56:14.088 --> 00:56:15.690
You came here as a child, Maria.

969
00:56:16.858 --> 00:56:18.559
It took you this
long to come back.


970
00:56:19.427 --> 00:56:21.894
Why do you keep taking ownership

971
00:56:21.896 --> 00:56:23.798
for the things that
are happening here?


972
00:56:24.832 --> 00:56:27.332
(stream running)

973
00:56:27.334 --> 00:56:30.035
(soft music)

974
00:56:30.037 --> 00:56:32.707
(Maria sighing)

975
00:56:34.142 --> 00:56:36.575
- Remember the voice
of the young girl


976
00:56:36.577 --> 00:56:37.843
that I've been hearing?

977
00:56:37.845 --> 00:56:39.480
She's been feeling
for her doll back.


978
00:56:42.884 --> 00:56:45.417
I thought that the
only way to make


979
00:56:45.419 --> 00:56:48.420
my dreams stop was
by coming here.


980
00:56:48.422 --> 00:56:50.890
- [Girl] Give me my doll.

981
00:56:50.892 --> 00:56:52.960
- Who's there? 
Where are you?

982
00:56:55.229 --> 00:56:57.229
- [Girl] It's been
so many years.


983
00:56:57.231 --> 00:56:59.165
I didn't think you'd ever come.

984
00:56:59.167 --> 00:57:00.766
- Leave her alone.

985
00:57:00.768 --> 00:57:03.269
- [Girl] Did she bring
what I asked for?


986
00:57:03.271 --> 00:57:04.470
- You gotta do it.

987
00:57:04.472 --> 00:57:06.105
- What if I didn't?

988
00:57:06.107 --> 00:57:08.741
(girl speaking indistinctly)

989
00:57:08.743 --> 00:57:09.644
- Let's go.

990
00:57:10.511 --> 00:57:14.015
(suspenseful piano music)

991
00:57:26.127 --> 00:57:28.594
Maria, what are you doing?

992
00:57:28.596 --> 00:57:30.830
- Can't you hear that?

993
00:57:30.832 --> 00:57:31.997
- What?

994
00:57:31.999 --> 00:57:32.834
- That.

995
00:57:34.035 --> 00:57:35.935
- Maria, we have to
get out of here now.


996
00:57:35.937 --> 00:57:37.672
- Look, I'm going in.

997
00:57:38.673 --> 00:57:40.439
You don't have to join me.

998
00:57:40.441 --> 00:57:43.945
(suspenseful piano music)

999
00:57:49.584 --> 00:57:50.416
Come on.

1000
00:57:50.418 --> 00:57:53.421
(suspenseful music)

1001
00:58:13.074 --> 00:58:14.840
(floorboards creaking)

1002
00:58:14.842 --> 00:58:17.912
(gentle piano music)

1003
00:58:20.314 --> 00:58:22.648
- I didn't expect
this to happen.


1004
00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:25.753
(gentle piano music)

1005
00:58:29.323 --> 00:58:31.790
(stream lapping)

1006
00:58:31.792 --> 00:58:34.862
(gentle piano music)

1007
00:58:39.066 --> 00:58:39.932
- Bye.

1008
00:58:39.934 --> 00:58:43.004
(gentle piano music)

1009
00:58:47.441 --> 00:58:50.042
(birds singing)

1010
00:58:50.044 --> 00:58:53.047
(suspenseful music)

1011
00:59:05.326 --> 00:59:07.259
- [Girl] Give me my doll!

1012
00:59:07.261 --> 00:59:10.329
(soft music)

1013
00:59:10.331 --> 00:59:12.833
(girl crying)

1014
00:59:14.403 --> 00:59:15.569
- Maria, wait!

1015
00:59:16.837 --> 00:59:19.204
(birds singing)

1016
00:59:19.206 --> 00:59:21.943
(stream running)

1017
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.488
I'm sorry. I ...

1018
00:59:36.057 --> 00:59:36.958
I wasn't thinking.

1019
00:59:39.961 --> 00:59:41.493
- [Girl] Give me my doll!

1020
00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:43.829
(stream running)

1021
00:59:43.831 --> 00:59:46.267
(soft music)

1022
00:59:49.404 --> 00:59:51.236
- I'll make ...

1023
00:59:51.238 --> 00:59:52.840
I'll make it up to you. I'll ...

1024
00:59:54.342 --> 00:59:56.575
I'll get you more. I'll ...

1025
00:59:56.577 --> 00:59:59.280
I'll get you many more,
hundred, hundreds more.


1026
01:00:02.516 --> 01:00:03.349
I'm sorry.

1027
01:00:03.351 --> 01:00:06.120
(stream running)

1028
01:00:08.457 --> 01:00:10.489
- [Adrian] The dolls
seemed to keep coming


1029
01:00:10.491 --> 01:00:12.326
and coming and coming.

1030
01:00:13.694 --> 01:00:15.464
I couldn't keep up
with her demand.


1031
01:00:16.664 --> 01:00:18.731
(stream running)

1032
01:00:18.733 --> 01:00:22.201
(birds singing)

1033
01:00:22.203 --> 01:00:23.938
My hands were pruned.

1034
01:00:25.272 --> 01:00:27.639
Blistered, and my body ached.

1035
01:00:27.641 --> 01:00:30.479
But I couldn't
stop, her sadness.


1036
01:00:31.512 --> 01:00:33.914
(soft music)

1037
01:00:36.217 --> 01:00:38.017
Nothing was ever enough.

1038
01:00:38.019 --> 01:00:40.721
(stream running)

1039
01:00:41.689 --> 01:00:43.290
She wouldn't stop crying.

1040
01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:45.593
I couldn't sleep.

1041
01:00:47.294 --> 01:00:48.996
Yet I stayed focused.

1042
01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.435
The demand became so high.

1043
01:00:54.969 --> 01:00:55.770
She wanted more.

1044
01:00:58.005 --> 01:00:59.605
I was aimless,

1045
01:00:59.607 --> 01:01:01.408
hopeless and defenseless.

1046
01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:03.811
(soft music)

1047
01:01:05.312 --> 01:01:06.881
It went on for many years.

1048
01:01:08.215 --> 01:01:10.351
At times I questioned my faith.

1049
01:01:12.186 --> 01:01:13.120
But in the end,

1050
01:01:14.555 --> 01:01:16.456
it's all that kept me going.

1051
01:01:16.458 --> 01:01:18.859
(soft music)

1052
01:01:22.997 --> 01:01:25.766
I had to trust that
God had a plan.


1053
01:01:27.735 --> 01:01:28.869
And this was it for me.

1054
01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:36.675
- Adrian, I'm so sorry.

1055
01:01:36.677 --> 01:01:38.577
If I'd have known, I, I--

1056
01:01:38.579 --> 01:01:39.680
- It's not your fault.

1057
01:01:40.781 --> 01:01:42.216
I should have explained.

1058
01:01:45.086 --> 01:01:47.487
- You were just being kind.

1059
01:01:47.489 --> 01:01:49.522
You shouldn't have
been punished for it.


1060
01:01:49.524 --> 01:01:50.925
- You don't understand.

1061
01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:54.496
The girl,

1062
01:01:57.264 --> 01:01:58.500
her life, her,

1063
01:01:59.434 --> 01:02:00.801
her innocence was taken.

1064
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:04.573
I just wanted to honor her.

1065
01:02:06.541 --> 01:02:08.309
Just help her to rest in peace.

1066
01:02:11.378 --> 01:02:12.547
- What happened to her?

1067
01:02:15.282 --> 01:02:16.117
- I ...

1068
01:02:17.486 --> 01:02:20.352
I don't know how
she got there or


1069
01:02:20.354 --> 01:02:21.622
where she came from.

1070
01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:25.226
Nobody ever came to
look for the body.


1071
01:02:28.295 --> 01:02:30.599
She even doubted
her own existence.


1072
01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:33.602
I just knew I should help her.

1073
01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:36.770
She'd been dealt such a

1074
01:02:38.172 --> 01:02:40.139
unimaginable hand in life.

1075
01:02:40.141 --> 01:02:40.975
I ...

1076
01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:46.647
I didn't want that to follow
suit in the, in the afterlife.


1077
01:02:50.017 --> 01:02:51.216
- Maria, I think we should--

1078
01:02:51.218 --> 01:02:52.019
- Just.

1079
01:02:53.154 --> 01:02:54.623
Just wait one moment.

1080
01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:58.257
- Did you bring it?

1081
01:02:58.259 --> 01:03:01.326
(soft piano music)

1082
01:03:01.328 --> 01:03:04.064
(stream running)

1083
01:03:08.869 --> 01:03:11.236
(birds singing)

1084
01:03:11.238 --> 01:03:12.438
- [Guillermo] Who is it?

1085
01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.708
- It's Yaz. I need
picking up right now.


1086
01:03:16.143 --> 01:03:17.876
- [Guillermo] It's too late.
You should have called sooner.


1087
01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:20.746
I'll be there tomorrow evening
when the tide is right.


1088
01:03:20.748 --> 01:03:22.584
- No, please, you
have to come now.


1089
01:03:23.717 --> 01:03:24.883
- [Guillermo] I
may run a business,


1090
01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:26.320
but I'm not at
your beck and call.


1091
01:03:27.788 --> 01:03:29.821
- I'll pay you anything.
I'll pay you double.


1092
01:03:29.823 --> 01:03:31.190
I'll pay you more.

1093
01:03:31.192 --> 01:03:32.791
- [Guillermo] Has
something happened?


1094
01:03:32.793 --> 01:03:36.096
Tell me, has something
happened on the island?


1095
01:03:36.964 --> 01:03:39.465
- Please, come and pick me up.

1096
01:03:39.467 --> 01:03:41.503
- [Guillermo] Yeah,
are you there?


1097
01:03:42.369 --> 01:03:45.070
(stream running)

1098
01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:48.075
Hello. Talk to me,
what's happening?


1099
01:03:49.076 --> 01:03:51.845
(stream running)

1100
01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.616
- [Oliver] Well, 
Maria, did you?

1101
01:03:56.518 --> 01:03:58.651
Did you bring it with you?

1102
01:03:58.653 --> 01:03:59.454
- I ...

1103
01:04:01.288 --> 01:04:02.522
I ...

1104
01:04:02.524 --> 01:04:03.456
- [Oliver] Answer
the question, Maria.


1105
01:04:03.458 --> 01:04:04.892
Did you bring the doll with you?

1106
01:04:07.662 --> 01:04:11.566
- Maria, despite your silence,

1107
01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:16.538
the spirit of the girl
has, has awokened.


1108
01:04:17.572 --> 01:04:18.772
Which means you have,

1109
01:04:22.644 --> 01:04:24.579
I always said, such
a friendly face.


1110
01:04:27.616 --> 01:04:29.083
I always remember your voice.

1111
01:04:30.918 --> 01:04:33.553
You had an,

1112
01:04:33.555 --> 01:04:34.456
an innocence that,

1113
01:04:36.223 --> 01:04:37.992
you reminded me of
my own children.


1114
01:04:39.494 --> 01:04:41.529
- Why did you leave
your family for this?


1115
01:04:42.464 --> 01:04:45.400
(soft piano music)

1116
01:04:47.268 --> 01:04:48.102
- Because,

1117
01:04:51.105 --> 01:04:51.939
God has a,

1118
01:04:53.608 --> 01:04:55.610
God has a plan for all of us.

1119
01:04:57.077 --> 01:04:58.178
Sometimes,

1120
01:04:59.947 --> 01:05:01.416
being kind to

1121
01:05:02.751 --> 01:05:04.452
people and to God

1122
01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:06.820
comes at a price.

1123
01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:12.525
Being kind is the
ultimate sacrifice.


1124
01:05:12.527 --> 01:05:15.430
(soft piano music)

1125
01:05:17.732 --> 01:05:18.667
From my ...

1126
01:05:20.502 --> 01:05:21.335
From ....

1127
01:05:22.437 --> 01:05:23.270
From ...

1128
01:05:24.506 --> 01:05:26.273
From a certain perspective,

1129
01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:31.979
sometimes being
selfless is selfish.


1130
01:05:34.081 --> 01:05:36.984
(soft piano music)

1131
01:05:38.386 --> 01:05:39.219
I ...

1132
01:05:40.087 --> 01:05:42.422
I did what I thought was right.

1133
01:05:42.424 --> 01:05:45.326
(soft piano music)

1134
01:05:48.228 --> 01:05:50.530
(bag unzipping)

1135
01:05:50.532 --> 01:05:53.468
(soft piano music)

1136
01:06:08.248 --> 01:06:09.749
- Maria, what have you done?

1137
01:06:09.751 --> 01:06:11.883
- Oliver, give me the doll.

1138
01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:13.488
- Why would you bring this here?

1139
01:06:15.322 --> 01:06:18.023
- Look, I have been
ignoring my dreams


1140
01:06:18.025 --> 01:06:19.694
for as long as I can remember.

1141
01:06:20.795 --> 01:06:22.662
I've only just recently
started to believe


1142
01:06:22.664 --> 01:06:25.866
that they are true, that I
could so something about them.


1143
01:06:27.034 --> 01:06:30.570
Oliver, I've not spoken
to my mother in years.


1144
01:06:30.572 --> 01:06:32.705
Why do you think
you've never met her?


1145
01:06:32.707 --> 01:06:34.409
This is why.

1146
01:06:36.143 --> 01:06:38.811
I need, I need
to let it all go,

1147
01:06:38.813 --> 01:06:41.714
but there is a part of
me that still blames her


1148
01:06:41.716 --> 01:06:43.315
for all of this.

1149
01:06:43.317 --> 01:06:45.117
- But you don't blame the
man who gave you the doll?


1150
01:06:45.119 --> 01:06:47.420
- I didn't know that
this was gonna happen.


1151
01:06:47.422 --> 01:06:49.087
I was just trying
to give it back.


1152
01:06:49.089 --> 01:06:51.524
- What took you so
long to bring it back?


1153
01:06:51.526 --> 01:06:52.560
- I just couldn't.

1154
01:06:54.128 --> 01:06:56.928
I didn't know what
was gonna happen,


1155
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.166
and I guess a part of
me didn't want to know.


1156
01:07:00.602 --> 01:07:02.835
Oliver, I don't know who
I am without these dreams.


1157
01:07:02.837 --> 01:07:04.773
Who I am if they just stop.

1158
01:07:07.307 --> 01:07:10.643
I was just trying to
understand what happened here.


1159
01:07:10.645 --> 01:07:13.345
What happened to Adrian,
what happened to me.


1160
01:07:13.347 --> 01:07:14.616
- People are dead, Maria.

1161
01:07:16.316 --> 01:07:20.588
Look, if you won't hand the
doll back, I'll do it myself.


1162
01:07:22.222 --> 01:07:24.893
(feet stepping)

1163
01:07:27.194 --> 01:07:30.797
- Oliver!

1164
01:07:30.799 --> 01:07:33.699
- I'd be careful if I were you.

1165
01:07:33.701 --> 01:07:35.300
Not any closer.

1166
01:07:35.302 --> 01:07:36.669
- Okay.

1167
01:07:36.671 --> 01:07:38.103
Okay, have it your way.

1168
01:07:38.105 --> 01:07:41.810
But please, just let Oliver
and Yaz, let them go.


1169
01:07:43.445 --> 01:07:45.177
- I like you.

1170
01:07:45.179 --> 01:07:49.417
You're fast. I wish
you didn't have to die.


1171
01:07:50.385 --> 01:07:51.553
- Who are you?

1172
01:07:52.387 --> 01:07:54.321
- Why does that matter?

1173
01:07:56.691 --> 01:07:59.692
- You don't need to do this.
I know that you don't want to.


1174
01:07:59.694 --> 01:08:02.595
- You don't know what I want.

1175
01:08:02.597 --> 01:08:05.500
- Look, I was just
a child, okay?


1176
01:08:06.534 --> 01:08:08.033
Something awful happened to you.

1177
01:08:08.035 --> 01:08:09.402
That doesn't mean you
need to take it out


1178
01:08:09.404 --> 01:08:10.436
on everyone else.

1179
01:08:10.438 --> 01:08:12.872
- You stole from me!

1180
01:08:12.874 --> 01:08:14.339
- Look, I'm sorry.

1181
01:08:14.341 --> 01:08:16.843
I'm sorry, I didn't know
what that doll meant to you


1182
01:08:16.845 --> 01:08:18.444
but it was given to
me, I never stole it.


1183
01:08:18.446 --> 01:08:19.645
- Liar!

1184
01:08:19.647 --> 01:08:20.413
- Maria, please, just
give her the doll!


1185
01:08:20.415 --> 01:08:21.547
- Quiet!

1186
01:08:21.549 --> 01:08:22.615
- Trust me, trust me.

1187
01:08:22.617 --> 01:08:24.851
- Why would I trust you?

1188
01:08:24.853 --> 01:08:27.954
I could never trust anyone.

1189
01:08:27.956 --> 01:08:29.922
- You must have trusted Adrian.

1190
01:08:29.924 --> 01:08:31.593
- I didn't trust
him, not really.


1191
01:08:33.528 --> 01:08:35.260
- Maybe you could have,

1192
01:08:35.262 --> 01:08:37.897
you didn't have to
make it so hard on him.


1193
01:08:37.899 --> 01:08:39.665
- What do you know?

1194
01:08:39.667 --> 01:08:42.300
You knew why my dolls
were on this island,


1195
01:08:42.302 --> 01:08:44.904
and you took one anyway.

1196
01:08:44.906 --> 01:08:46.508
It was mine.

1197
01:08:49.744 --> 01:08:51.978
- I was just a child,
much like you were.


1198
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:53.948
- You were nothing like me.

1199
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:58.684
- Look, we are
all born innocent.


1200
01:08:58.686 --> 01:09:01.787
Okay, but as we grow,
we change, we adapt


1201
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:04.022
to our environment, I guess.

1202
01:09:04.024 --> 01:09:06.394
Look, none of this, none
of this is your fault.


1203
01:09:07.462 --> 01:09:08.295
Here.

1204
01:09:10.765 --> 01:09:11.964
Take the doll.

1205
01:09:11.966 --> 01:09:13.399
- Maria, quick, 
I can't breathe.

1206
01:09:13.401 --> 01:09:14.634
- Take it, come on just take it

1207
01:09:14.636 --> 01:09:16.334
and let Oliver and
let Yaz go free.


1208
01:09:16.336 --> 01:09:17.737
- No.

1209
01:09:17.739 --> 01:09:19.505
You don't deserve it.

1210
01:09:19.507 --> 01:09:21.574
You took what I love from me,

1211
01:09:21.576 --> 01:09:24.443
so I will take what
you love from you.


1212
01:09:24.445 --> 01:09:26.879
- Come on, we can, we can come
to some sort of arrangement.


1213
01:09:26.881 --> 01:09:28.146
Just take the doll.

1214
01:09:28.148 --> 01:09:30.250
- Never. You don't
deserve anything.


1215
01:09:32.119 --> 01:09:34.052
- Maria, I can't
hold on much longer.


1216
01:09:34.054 --> 01:09:35.120
- Quiet!

1217
01:09:35.122 --> 01:09:38.560
(soft suspenseful music)

1218
01:09:41.261 --> 01:09:42.229
What are you doing?

1219
01:09:44.197 --> 01:09:45.033
- Josie.

1220
01:09:48.836 --> 01:09:50.636
Josie, is that your name?

1221
01:09:50.638 --> 01:09:54.172
(gentle piano music)

1222
01:09:54.174 --> 01:09:55.242
It is, isn't it?

1223
01:09:56.778 --> 01:09:58.911
Your name is Josie?

1224
01:09:58.913 --> 01:10:00.846
- Maria, you can't trust her.

1225
01:10:00.848 --> 01:10:01.849
- Yes I can.

1226
01:10:02.817 --> 01:10:04.115
She's just a child.

1227
01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:07.187
(gentle piano music)

1228
01:10:08.322 --> 01:10:09.490
Take the doll.

1229
01:10:11.059 --> 01:10:12.425
Take the doll.

1230
01:10:12.427 --> 01:10:13.559
It's not too late.

1231
01:10:13.561 --> 01:10:16.631
(gentle piano music)

1232
01:10:24.839 --> 01:10:26.173
- It always was.

1233
01:10:31.012 --> 01:10:33.915
(lighter striking)

1234
01:10:34.882 --> 01:10:37.619
(flames roaring)

1235
01:10:40.855 --> 01:10:42.922
- [Maria] Get out. Get out!

1236
01:10:42.924 --> 01:10:46.726
- [Oliver] Come on,
Maria, we have to go.


1237
01:10:46.728 --> 01:10:47.593
- Wait, wait.

1238
01:10:47.595 --> 01:10:50.565
(suspenseful music)

1239
01:10:59.574 --> 01:11:01.141
- She's dead, Maria.

1240
01:11:02.644 --> 01:11:03.576
We have to go.

1241
01:11:03.578 --> 01:11:06.981
(soft suspenseful music)

1242
01:11:13.721 --> 01:11:16.457
(flames roaring)

1243
01:11:24.164 --> 01:11:27.232
(soft suspenseful music)

1244
01:11:27.234 --> 01:11:29.971
(flames roaring)

1245
01:11:39.246 --> 01:11:42.249
(suspenseful music)

1246
01:11:49.289 --> 01:11:52.558
(flames roaring)

1247
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.460
(Oliver breathing hard)

1248
01:11:54.462 --> 01:11:55.428
- It's so good to see you.

1249
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:56.731
- I wish I could say the same.

1250
01:11:59.067 --> 01:12:00.101
Where are the others?

1251
01:12:03.738 --> 01:12:04.572
Where is Yaz?

1252
01:12:07.942 --> 01:12:09.542
(Guillermo exhaling)

1253
01:12:09.544 --> 01:12:12.144
(waves crashing)

1254
01:12:12.146 --> 01:12:13.979
It's okay. Come with me.

1255
01:12:13.981 --> 01:12:16.751
(waves crashing)

1256
01:12:18.386 --> 01:12:21.321
- I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

1257
01:12:22.757 --> 01:12:26.025
- [Guillermo] Come on. The
boat is right over here.


1258
01:12:26.027 --> 01:12:28.928
(waves crashing)

1259
01:12:28.930 --> 01:12:32.433
(suspenseful piano music)

1260
01:12:52.186 --> 01:12:53.719
- Rest easy, my angel.

1261
01:12:53.721 --> 01:12:56.090
(soft music)

1262
01:13:07.034 --> 01:13:08.536
God be with you, Josie.

1263
01:13:10.138 --> 01:13:11.271
Peace at last.

1264
01:13:29.289 --> 01:13:31.891
- [Mother] I'm surprised
to hear from you.


1265
01:13:31.893 --> 01:13:32.727
- Yeah, I know.

1266
01:13:33.628 --> 01:13:35.360
It's been too long.

1267
01:13:35.362 --> 01:13:37.663
- [Mother] I've
tried reaching out.


1268
01:13:37.665 --> 01:13:38.499
- I know.

1269
01:13:39.534 --> 01:13:40.367
I'm sorry.

1270
01:13:41.769 --> 01:13:43.269
- [Mother] So what do you want?

1271
01:13:43.271 --> 01:13:45.104
Money? I have none.

1272
01:13:45.106 --> 01:13:46.739
Advice? None to give.

1273
01:13:46.741 --> 01:13:49.110
Opinion? Never appreciated.

1274
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:53.881
- I just, I just wanna
talk, Mum. That's all.


1275
01:13:55.249 --> 01:13:56.083
I miss you.

1276
01:13:57.251 --> 01:13:59.921
(mother crying)

1277
01:14:01.321 --> 01:14:05.124
Hey look, I'll come and visit
you when I get back, okay?


1278
01:14:05.126 --> 01:14:07.161
I just wanna put this
distance behind us.


1279
01:14:08.029 --> 01:14:10.064
- [Mother] I don't understand.

1280
01:14:11.232 --> 01:14:12.233
- You don't need to.

1281
01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:15.768
- [Mother] Well,
whenever you're ready,


1282
01:14:15.770 --> 01:14:18.239
there's dinner on the
table, nothing's changed.


1283
01:14:19.173 --> 01:14:20.007
- Thank you.

1284
01:14:22.076 --> 01:14:24.078
- [Mother] Plus, I
want to meet Oliver.


1285
01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:26.414
- Yes, Mum.

1286
01:14:27.582 --> 01:14:29.114
- [Mother] Tell him
I want to meet him


1287
01:14:29.116 --> 01:14:31.150
sooner rather than later.

1288
01:14:31.152 --> 01:14:33.252
- I will, don't worry.

1289
01:14:33.254 --> 01:14:34.386
Look, I'll call
you when I get back


1290
01:14:34.388 --> 01:14:36.422
to arrange something, okay?

1291
01:14:36.424 --> 01:14:37.556
- [Mother] Why? 
Where are you?

1292
01:14:37.558 --> 01:14:39.725
- I'll tell you when I see you.

1293
01:14:39.727 --> 01:14:42.828
- [Mother] Okay, fine.
I look forward to it.


1294
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:44.697
See you soon, Misha.

1295
01:14:44.699 --> 01:14:45.700
- Okay, bye.

1296
01:14:50.071 --> 01:14:52.740
(Maria sighing)

1297
01:14:53.941 --> 01:14:57.011
- I'm impressed. Didn't
think you had it in you.


1298
01:14:58.713 --> 01:15:00.380
- I have a lot of
making up to do.


1299
01:15:02.683 --> 01:15:05.851
- I understand,
you know. I get it.


1300
01:15:05.853 --> 01:15:07.121
Some things are personal.

1301
01:15:09.991 --> 01:15:13.027
- Look, I trust
you. And I love you.


1302
01:15:14.362 --> 01:15:15.429
No more closed doors.

1303
01:15:17.231 --> 01:15:19.300
- Oh yeah? Got you a coffee.

1304
01:15:20.201 --> 01:15:21.200
- Thanks.

1305
01:15:21.202 --> 01:15:24.105
(soft piano music)

1306
01:15:29.477 --> 01:15:30.311
This feels weird.

1307
01:15:31.445 --> 01:15:32.280
- What does?

1308
01:15:33.881 --> 01:15:35.950
- All of this being over.

1309
01:15:37.084 --> 01:15:38.152
- The dreams?

1310
01:15:39.353 --> 01:15:40.187
- Stopped.

1311
01:15:41.589 --> 01:15:42.990
- Don't take it for granted.

1312
01:15:44.393 --> 01:15:45.192
- I don't.

1313
01:15:48.162 --> 01:15:50.798
I don't know, sometimes
the silence is worse.


1314
01:15:53.968 --> 01:15:55.469
The memories of the dreams and

1315
01:15:57.171 --> 01:16:01.340
reality, they come
into my mind and,


1316
01:16:01.342 --> 01:16:02.541
I don't know, I don't
think it's to scare me,


1317
01:16:02.543 --> 01:16:06.314
or to put me at
ease, I don't know.


1318
01:16:08.316 --> 01:16:10.518
- What parts do you see?

1319
01:16:12.687 --> 01:16:13.521
- Josie.

1320
01:16:15.456 --> 01:16:17.189
I hear her voice.

1321
01:16:17.191 --> 01:16:18.824
Her laugh.

1322
01:16:18.826 --> 01:16:19.660
Her cry.

1323
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:24.730
I can't help but think
of the others as well.


1324
01:16:24.732 --> 01:16:27.132
- You can't blame
yourself, Maria.


1325
01:16:27.134 --> 01:16:28.567
You weren't to know what
the dolls would cause.


1326
01:16:28.569 --> 01:16:29.837
You were just a child.

1327
01:16:30.738 --> 01:16:33.908
(soft dramatic music)

1328
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:37.044
- Maybe you're right.

1329
01:16:38.245 --> 01:16:41.416
(soft dramatic music)

1330
01:16:44.318 --> 01:16:46.087
- Come on. It's time.

1331
01:16:48.457 --> 01:16:49.323
Let's go home.

1332
01:16:51.393 --> 01:16:54.729
(upbeat dramatic music)
