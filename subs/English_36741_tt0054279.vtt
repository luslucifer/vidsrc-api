1
00:03:41.215 --> 00:03:44.418
Mr. Potter?
Come in, you're late.


2
00:03:45.486 --> 00:03:46.518
I'm sorry.

3
00:03:46.553 --> 00:03:49.223
The, erm, the train.

4
00:03:51.358 --> 00:03:57.231
Punctuality is the politeness of
princes, Mr. Potter always says.


5
00:03:58.832 --> 00:04:02.035
Mr. Potter is just starting his
beginning-of-term speech.


6
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.637
You'll have to wait.

7
00:04:13.013 --> 00:04:16.984
With which sentiment I'm sure
you will agree.


8
00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.585
You all know that
in the beginning,


9
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.653
there were Adam and Eve.

10
00:04:20.187 --> 00:04:23.390
You'll remember that Adam bit
into that apple,


11
00:04:23.425 --> 00:04:27.127
at which moment the first
loser was born.


12
00:04:28.764 --> 00:04:33.000
Yes, the pattern was set,
and the world divided,


13
00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:35.669
not into male and female.
Oh, no, no, no.


14
00:04:36.203 --> 00:04:41.008
That's just a mere superficial
division of minor importance.


15
00:04:41.043 --> 00:04:44.745
No, gentlemen, there is
another division,


16
00:04:45.045 --> 00:04:46.845
another dichotomy,

17
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.617
more basic, more profound.
At that fateful moment,


18
00:04:50.652 --> 00:04:53.821
the world was divided
into winners...


19
00:04:53.856 --> 00:04:55.707
and losers.

20
00:04:55.742 --> 00:04:57.717
Top men...

21
00:04:57.752 --> 00:04:59.658
and underdogs.

22
00:04:59.693 --> 00:05:02.362
In a word, the one-up...

23
00:05:02.397 --> 00:05:05.032
and the one-down.

24
00:05:05.365 --> 00:05:06.598
Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes,

25
00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:10.904
I can see the question
in your hungry eyes.


26
00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.107
You want to know
what is Lifemanship.


27
00:05:14.142 --> 00:05:15.140
Well, gentlemen,

28
00:05:15.175 --> 00:05:18.912
Lifemanship is the science of
being one up on your opponents


29
00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:21.013
at all times.

30
00:05:21.048 --> 00:05:25.853
It is the art of making him feel
that somewhere somehow,


31
00:05:25.888 --> 00:05:27.988
he has become less than you,

32
00:05:28.522 --> 00:05:32.259
less desirable, less worthy...

33
00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:35.427
less blessed.

34
00:05:35.462 --> 00:05:38.665
Who then, you ask,
are your opponents?


35
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.834
Everybody, in a word,
who is not you.


36
00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:45.606
And the purpose of your life
must be to be one up on them,


37
00:05:45.641 --> 00:05:48.275
because, and mark this well,

38
00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:51.478
he who is not one up...

39
00:05:51.513 --> 00:05:53.310
is one down.

40
00:05:53.345 --> 00:05:55.107
Come in!

41
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.623
Potter?

42
00:06:03.224 --> 00:06:04.791
Yes.

43
00:06:04.826 --> 00:06:08.029
They sometimes call me,
Mr. Potter, but...


44
00:06:08.563 --> 00:06:10.698
I beg your pardon.

45
00:06:11.232 --> 00:06:13.368
I'm Mr. Henry Palfrey.

46
00:06:13.902 --> 00:06:16.037
Ah! Sit down, Palfrey.

47
00:06:19.774 --> 00:06:23.511
Well? Tell me all about
yourself, Palfrey.


48
00:06:23.546 --> 00:06:28.316
Well, it's like this,
Mr. Potter...


49
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.519
have a cigarette, Palfrey.

50
00:06:31.554 --> 00:06:34.687
Thank you, Potter.

51
00:06:34.722 --> 00:06:37.926
You don't mind my cigar,
do you, Mr. Palfrey?


52
00:06:37.961 --> 00:06:41.129
Not at all, Mr. Potter.

53
00:06:41.663 --> 00:06:43.798
Thank you, Henry. Ha ha!

54
00:06:44.332 --> 00:06:45.933
My round, I think.

55
00:06:45.968 --> 00:06:47.500
What do you mean?

56
00:06:47.535 --> 00:06:49.636
Never mind, we'll talk
about that later.


57
00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:53.942
Now tell me, what first prompted
you to enrol in the college?


58
00:06:53.977 --> 00:06:55.508
Well...

59
00:06:55.543 --> 00:06:57.679
frankly, Mr. Potter,

60
00:06:57.714 --> 00:06:59.280
I'm a failure.

61
00:06:59.814 --> 00:07:00.564
No.

62
00:07:03.551 --> 00:07:06.220
You'll have some tea with me,
won't you, Palfrey?


63
00:07:06.255 --> 00:07:07.787
Thank you very much.

64
00:07:07.822 --> 00:07:09.958
So, you want to be a success.

65
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:12.058
Well, I think we can help you.

66
00:07:12.093 --> 00:07:13.695
But first, I like to have a
clear picture of the background


67
00:07:14.228 --> 00:07:16.898
of the student.
You're in love, of course.


68
00:07:16.933 --> 00:07:18.499
How did you know?

69
00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:21.703
Thank you, Alice.
Have a muffin, Palfrey.


70
00:07:21.738 --> 00:07:22.770
Thank you.

71
00:07:23.304 --> 00:07:25.439
Blonde?
Erm...


72
00:07:25.474 --> 00:07:27.540
no, with lemon.

73
00:07:27.575 --> 00:07:31.312
The young lady...
is she a blonde?


74
00:07:31.846 --> 00:07:33.448
Oh, I see!

75
00:07:33.982 --> 00:07:36.651
Er, well, not quite.

76
00:07:37.185 --> 00:07:38.786
That could be serious.

77
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.922
Now, let's begin at
the beginning.


78
00:07:41.222 --> 00:07:46.260
How did you first meet this
not quite blonde young lady?


79
00:07:46.295 --> 00:07:49.998
Well, it happened on Tuesday.

80
00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:51.564
Or was it Wednesday?

81
00:07:51.599 --> 00:07:54.767
Yes, Wedn... no, it wasn't,
it was Tuesday.


82
00:07:54.802 --> 00:07:58.006
I was on my way to the office
in the morning as usual.


83
00:08:06.014 --> 00:08:07.348
Oh!

84
00:08:07.383 --> 00:08:08.683
Oh! Oh!

85
00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:10.818
Of all the stupid, awkward...

86
00:08:11.352 --> 00:08:12.919
Clumsy?

87
00:08:12.954 --> 00:08:15.623
Clumsy idiots. Ooh!

88
00:08:18.826 --> 00:08:20.428
I say, I'm most terribly sorry

89
00:08:20.962 --> 00:08:22.296
sorry? Is that all you've
got to say


90
00:08:22.331 --> 00:08:23.631
when you knocked me down
like a wild...


91
00:08:24.165 --> 00:08:25.767
uncivilised?
Uncivilised.


92
00:08:25.802 --> 00:08:28.436
Savage?
Sava...


93
00:08:31.674 --> 00:08:34.273
No, not really.
Oh, but I am.


94
00:08:34.308 --> 00:08:37.512
Yes, I am permanently
uncivilised, I'm...


95
00:08:37.547 --> 00:08:38.579
Oh!
What's the matter?


96
00:08:39.113 --> 00:08:40.181
My beautiful new stocking's
ruined.


97
00:08:40.216 --> 00:08:42.334
Oh!
I'll probably sue you.


98
00:08:42.369 --> 00:08:43.944
Oh, I do wish you would.

99
00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:45.485
I'm fully insured, you know.

100
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.620
Personal, property,
accident, medical,


101
00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:48.688
all that sort of thing.
Just take your pick.


102
00:08:48.723 --> 00:08:50.858
No, thank you, but it's very
nice of you to offer.


103
00:08:50.893 --> 00:08:52.994
Look, give me those, I'm going
to be late for work.


104
00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:54.062
Under no circumstances.

105
00:08:54.595 --> 00:08:55.930
You're probably shaken
or bruised or something.


106
00:08:55.965 --> 00:08:57.265
The least I can do is to
carry them for you.


107
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.831
But then you'll be
late for work.


108
00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:01.537
Work? Oh, work!
That old thing. Ha ha ha.


109
00:09:01.572 --> 00:09:02.604
Well, you do work, don't you?

110
00:09:03.108 --> 00:09:03.872
Well, of course, I do,

111
00:09:04.206 --> 00:09:05.274
but they can do
without me for a while.


112
00:09:05.309 --> 00:09:07.409
I'm a... well,
I'm an executive.


113
00:09:07.444 --> 00:09:08.442
Oh!

114
00:09:08.477 --> 00:09:10.079
So, the later
the better, really.


115
00:09:10.114 --> 00:09:12.713
Yes, yes, of course.

116
00:09:12.748 --> 00:09:15.417
I say, are you sure you
don't want to sue me?


117
00:09:15.452 --> 00:09:17.553
Absolutely positive.
Yes, well, erm...


118
00:09:17.588 --> 00:09:20.187
what about the stockings?

119
00:09:20.222 --> 00:09:22.357
I'll let you into a secret.
They weren't new, anyway.


120
00:09:22.392 --> 00:09:25.561
Well, perhaps they had some
sentimental value?


121
00:09:25.596 --> 00:09:27.696
Not really enough to sue for.

122
00:09:27.731 --> 00:09:29.298
Pity, really.
Ha ha ha.


123
00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:32.501
Do you always come
this way to work?


124
00:09:32.536 --> 00:09:34.103
Yes, yes, I do.

125
00:09:39.441 --> 00:09:41.008
Someone's coming.

126
00:09:41.043 --> 00:09:42.644
The most handsome batting...

127
00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:45.064
ok, it's only the boss.

128
00:09:45.099 --> 00:09:47.449
And the lead's now 126...

129
00:09:47.484 --> 00:09:49.550
good morning!

130
00:09:49.585 --> 00:09:52.254
Evan has caught him
most gloriously!


131
00:09:53.891 --> 00:09:57.059
What's the score?
Shhh, I can't hear.


132
00:09:58.127 --> 00:09:59.194
Sorry.

133
00:10:01.864 --> 00:10:03.999
And now all round the ground...

134
00:10:04.034 --> 00:10:06.135
Miss Stevens!
Miss Wilson! Appleby!


135
00:10:06.668 --> 00:10:09.303
Yes, if times were normal,

136
00:10:09.338 --> 00:10:10.370
you'd all take a week's notice,

137
00:10:10.405 --> 00:10:13.040
but as times are
regrettably abnormal,


138
00:10:13.075 --> 00:10:14.676
I shall have to content myself
with a severe reprimand


139
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.812
on my return from Mr. Henry's
office.


140
00:10:17.346 --> 00:10:19.481
Meanwhile, back to your desks.

141
00:10:23.218 --> 00:10:24.785
Good morning, sir.

142
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.988
Ah, the very man
I wanted to see.


143
00:10:28.023 --> 00:10:31.760
Would you book a table for me
at the Camellia Room


144
00:10:31.795 --> 00:10:34.963
for tonight for two,
for 9 o'clock?


145
00:10:34.998 --> 00:10:36.530
The Camellia Room, sir?

146
00:10:36.565 --> 00:10:38.967
I'm taking someone to dinner.

147
00:10:39.002 --> 00:10:41.370
Taking or being taken, sir?

148
00:10:41.405 --> 00:10:43.505
Taking.

149
00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:46.175
Your late uncle always used
to say that the best place


150
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.310
for taking was the
Hampshire Buttery, sir.


151
00:10:48.844 --> 00:10:52.581
A very satisfying meal
for seven and sixpence.


152
00:10:52.616 --> 00:10:54.681
Here is the morning's business
sir,


153
00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:57.351
which I had ready on your desk
at 9 o'clock,


154
00:10:57.386 --> 00:11:00.589
but removed to a place of safety
pending your arrival.


155
00:11:00.624 --> 00:11:02.156
Thank you, Gloatbridge.

156
00:11:02.191 --> 00:11:05.359
Are there any decisions,
or are they just signatures?


157
00:11:05.394 --> 00:11:09.131
I think we decided that it
should be just signatures, sir,


158
00:11:09.166 --> 00:11:11.266
since you inadvertently...

159
00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:12.334
yes.

160
00:11:12.868 --> 00:11:15.003
You will remember I feel sure,
sir, just why we decided


161
00:11:15.038 --> 00:11:18.207
it should be just signatures
and not decisions.


162
00:11:18.242 --> 00:11:20.342
Of course.
Yes.


163
00:11:20.876 --> 00:11:24.079
Perhaps these painful memories
are best forgotten, sir.


164
00:11:27.317 --> 00:11:28.849
Hello?

165
00:11:28.884 --> 00:11:31.019
Yes, speaking.

166
00:11:31.553 --> 00:11:33.689
Douglas, old man.

167
00:11:34.223 --> 00:11:35.290
What?

168
00:11:36.892 --> 00:11:38.493
Ha ha ha ha.

169
00:11:39.027 --> 00:11:41.697
Tell me, what time is
the match on Saturday?


170
00:11:41.732 --> 00:11:43.298
Hmm?

171
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.501
I'm not playing?

172
00:11:48.103 --> 00:11:51.306
I must say I'm a
little surprised, yes.


173
00:11:51.341 --> 00:11:53.976
Well, who's in?

174
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:56.076
Walter?

175
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:59.314
But good gracious me, I can beat
Walter any day of the week.


176
00:11:59.848 --> 00:12:03.052
It was 6-2, 6-3 last time.

177
00:12:03.087 --> 00:12:04.052
Hmm?

178
00:12:05.223 --> 00:12:07.323
Well, listen, Douglas,

179
00:12:07.857 --> 00:12:10.259
you know I've got absolutely
nothing against Walter,


180
00:12:10.294 --> 00:12:12.627
in fact, he is, well,
he is one of my best friends,


181
00:12:12.662 --> 00:12:15.865
but it's just that I've been
looking forward to the game.


182
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.602
I've made all my arrangements.

183
00:12:19.637 --> 00:12:20.670
Yes, Douglas.

184
00:12:21.204 --> 00:12:24.941
Yes, I appreciate that, but...

185
00:12:24.976 --> 00:12:27.094
yes, Douglas.

186
00:12:27.129 --> 00:12:29.212
Yes, of course.

187
00:12:29.247 --> 00:12:31.365
Goodbye.

188
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.448
Oh, Douglas!

189
00:12:33.483 --> 00:12:35.618
My regards to Walter.

190
00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:43.092
Your morning newspaper, sir.

191
00:12:43.127 --> 00:12:45.762
Hmm? Oh, yes.

192
00:12:46.296 --> 00:12:47.328
And just to start you off, sir,

193
00:12:47.363 --> 00:12:50.566
number 23 Across is
"castles in Spain".


194
00:12:52.702 --> 00:12:54.269
Oh, erm...

195
00:12:54.304 --> 00:12:55.905
you won't forget that booking,
Gloatbridge?


196
00:12:56.439 --> 00:12:59.375
The Hampshire Buttery,
for two, at 9.


197
00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.312
The Camellia Room,
for two, at 9.


198
00:13:02.347 --> 00:13:03.878
Very well, sir.

199
00:13:03.913 --> 00:13:07.116
And number 13 Down is
"Cleopatra's needle".


200
00:13:15.658 --> 00:13:17.260
Good evening, madam.

201
00:13:18.861 --> 00:13:20.463
Good evening, sir.

202
00:13:27.403 --> 00:13:28.471
Good evening, sir.
Good evening.


203
00:13:29.005 --> 00:13:29.739
Madam.
Good evening.


204
00:13:30.073 --> 00:13:31.674
May I take your coat?
Thank you.


205
00:13:33.276 --> 00:13:34.877
Good evening.

206
00:13:37.013 --> 00:13:38.046
There we are.

207
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:40.216
Shall we go in?
Oh, yes.


208
00:13:47.156 --> 00:13:48.758
Yes?
Palfrey.


209
00:13:49.292 --> 00:13:51.392
Yes?
Table for two.


210
00:13:51.427 --> 00:13:53.528
I'm sorry, no table is free.

211
00:13:53.563 --> 00:13:56.232
Good evening, my lady.
Good evening.


212
00:13:56.267 --> 00:13:57.300
Number 27.

213
00:13:59.969 --> 00:14:01.037
I thought you said
you'd booked.


214
00:14:01.072 --> 00:14:02.603
Yes, I did.

215
00:14:02.638 --> 00:14:07.408
Erm, excuse me, I booked.

216
00:14:07.443 --> 00:14:10.646
Oh?
Erm, Palfrey. Henry Palfrey.


217
00:14:14.917 --> 00:14:16.519
Well, there's no one here
of that name.


218
00:14:17.053 --> 00:14:19.153
Palfrey.

219
00:14:19.188 --> 00:14:22.392
P- a-l-f-r-e-y.

220
00:14:23.993 --> 00:14:26.129
My chief clerk booked it for me.

221
00:14:26.662 --> 00:14:28.531
May I see that list?

222
00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:30.400
If you please, sir.

223
00:14:32.535 --> 00:14:34.137
He must've have booked at
another restaurant.


224
00:14:34.172 --> 00:14:36.806
Maybe if you gave him something.

225
00:14:36.841 --> 00:14:38.408
Yes, of course.

226
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:41.611
Erm...

227
00:14:53.356 --> 00:14:55.491
do you think, perhaps, you...

228
00:14:55.526 --> 00:14:58.126
might have another look?

229
00:14:58.161 --> 00:14:59.762
And what did you say
the name was, sir?


230
00:14:59.797 --> 00:15:01.863
Palfrey.

231
00:15:01.898 --> 00:15:05.636
We have a Mr. Poultry, here,
sir, table for two at 9 o'clock.


232
00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:09.373
That's me, Mr. Poultry. Ha ha!

233
00:15:09.408 --> 00:15:11.473
Unfortunately, sir,
it's now 9:15,


234
00:15:11.508 --> 00:15:14.444
and tables aren't held
beyond the booked time.


235
00:15:14.479 --> 00:15:17.381
You can wait.
I'll see what I can do for you


236
00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:18.982
of course.

237
00:15:21.652 --> 00:15:22.684
But look!

238
00:15:22.719 --> 00:15:24.854
There's a table over there.

239
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:26.955
How discerning you are, madam.

240
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:29.660
But you see, it's that
gentleman's table.


241
00:15:31.795 --> 00:15:33.896
Hail, good innkeeper!

242
00:15:33.931 --> 00:15:34.998
Hello, Sam.
Thank you, sir.


243
00:15:35.532 --> 00:15:36.600
Rose.

244
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:40.871
Good evening, Mr. Delauney.
Evening, Skinner.


245
00:15:40.906 --> 00:15:42.473
Hello, Ray!

246
00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:47.277
Oh, hello, er...

247
00:15:47.312 --> 00:15:48.879
Palfrey.

248
00:15:50.481 --> 00:15:53.150
Hello, hello, hello.

249
00:15:53.684 --> 00:15:55.250
Where did you find this
lovely creature?


250
00:15:55.285 --> 00:15:57.955
Oh, we met quite by accident,
as a matter of fact.


251
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.556
I was trying to catch a bus
and April was...


252
00:15:59.591 --> 00:16:01.692
well, do the decent thing,
old chap.


253
00:16:02.226 --> 00:16:03.258
Fellow club members
and that sort of thing.


254
00:16:03.293 --> 00:16:08.098
Yes, of course. Mr. Raymond
Delauney, Miss April Smith.


255
00:16:08.133 --> 00:16:09.665
What a romantic name.

256
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:12.369
"Oh, to be in England
now that April's here."


257
00:16:14.505 --> 00:16:15.572
How do you do?

258
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.242
How do you do?

259
00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:20.342
You two chaps finished
dinner already?


260
00:16:20.377 --> 00:16:23.046
We haven't even started.
We can't get a table.


261
00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.613
Oh, fiddle-dl-diddle.

262
00:16:24.648 --> 00:16:27.851
Skinner, my guests.
Certainly, sir.


263
00:16:29.987 --> 00:16:32.122
Now, tell me,
you lovely creature...


264
00:16:32.656 --> 00:16:35.325
oh, Palfrey, look after skinner,
this chap.


265
00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:36.927
Thank you, Mr. Delauney.

266
00:16:48.138 --> 00:16:51.341
N. Oh! I'm so sorry,
I beg your pardo


267
00:16:57.748 --> 00:16:59.349
sir.

268
00:17:07.891 --> 00:17:09.458
Oh, later, later.

269
00:17:09.493 --> 00:17:12.127
We'll order the wine first.

270
00:17:12.162 --> 00:17:14.796
I always feel that the food
should be chosen


271
00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:18.569
to suit the wine rather than
the other way, don't you?


272
00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.441
Here you are.
Thank you very much.


273
00:17:30.847 --> 00:17:32.983
Erm... number 93 looks...

274
00:17:33.517 --> 00:17:35.652
that little vineyard
in the Loire Valley,


275
00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:37.254
across the river from Pouilly.

276
00:17:37.289 --> 00:17:38.820
Carcajanette?

277
00:17:38.855 --> 00:17:41.490
That's it.
The '49, of course


278
00:17:41.525 --> 00:17:45.796
only if all the 47's gone.
Very good, sir.


279
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:47.931
Merci.

280
00:17:48.465 --> 00:17:50.601
Number 93 looked
pretty good to me.


281
00:17:51.134 --> 00:17:53.235
Really?

282
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:57.007
Carcajanette isn't expensive,
it's an honest little wine,


283
00:17:57.042 --> 00:18:00.227
especially if it's allowed
to breathe for a while,


284
00:18:00.262 --> 00:18:04.508
unless, of course, the grapes
have had too much of the.


285
00:18:04.543 --> 00:18:08.753
Dordogne wind in which case
they have a tendency to sulk.


286
00:18:08.788 --> 00:18:10.888
I think you'll like it

287
00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:12.455
I'm sure I will.

288
00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.626
And now for the fodder.

289
00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:18.896
Monsieur.

290
00:18:20.498 --> 00:18:23.132
Monsieur.
Ah, splendid.


291
00:18:23.167 --> 00:18:25.569
Shall I order for all of us?
Oh, yes, please do.


292
00:18:25.604 --> 00:18:27.972
Thank you, but I'd like
to see what there is.


293
00:18:31.709 --> 00:18:33.810
Waiter!

294
00:18:33.845 --> 00:18:35.980
What is "tortue nicoise"?

295
00:18:36.015 --> 00:18:38.116
Fried turtle.

296
00:18:39.717 --> 00:18:41.852
The brain of the calf.

297
00:18:41.887 --> 00:18:44.272
The liver of the chicken.

298
00:18:44.307 --> 00:18:46.623
The legs of the frog.

299
00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:49.861
The hoof of the mountain goat
in jelly.


300
00:18:50.928 --> 00:18:52.495
Tomatoes.

301
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.199
Perhaps you had better
order for all of us.


302
00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:57.335
Thank you.

303
00:18:58.403 --> 00:18:59.969
Waiter.

304
00:19:00.004 --> 00:19:02.140
Tell the chef Mr. Delauney
would like to see him.


305
00:19:02.175 --> 00:19:03.172
Oui, monsieur.

306
00:19:03.207 --> 00:19:06.944
I simply gritted my teeth to
hide the excruciating pain


307
00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.614
and played the next three sets
on strategy,


308
00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:12.817
determination, and one leg.

309
00:19:12.852 --> 00:19:14.917
How wonderful.

310
00:19:14.952 --> 00:19:16.554
Isn't that wonderful, Henry?

311
00:19:16.589 --> 00:19:18.121
Mm, wonderful.

312
00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:20.825
I play a fair game of tennis
myself, you know.


313
00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.494
Oh, do you...?
Oh, yes, I remember once...


314
00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:25.380
yes, he does.

315
00:19:25.415 --> 00:19:27.196
Very fair game.

316
00:19:27.231 --> 00:19:29.366
As a matter of fact,
you can see it for yourself.


317
00:19:29.401 --> 00:19:31.519
Palfrey, why don't you
invite our little lady


318
00:19:31.554 --> 00:19:33.638
to see you play
for the club on Saturday?


319
00:19:33.673 --> 00:19:35.239
Could I?
Erm...


320
00:19:35.773 --> 00:19:38.976
well, the fact is they seem
to have decided...


321
00:19:39.011 --> 00:19:42.180
Oh, yes, I did hear
something about that.


322
00:19:42.215 --> 00:19:43.247
Hard cheese, old boy.

323
00:19:43.781 --> 00:19:45.916
They say Walter has
improved enormously.


324
00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:48.017
Still, there's no reason
why our little lady


325
00:19:48.052 --> 00:19:51.220
shouldn't see you play.
Why don't you and I have a go?


326
00:19:51.255 --> 00:19:53.925
I'm not playing for the club
either... the old leg, you know.


327
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.491
Well, if your leg's still
troubling you...


328
00:19:55.526 --> 00:19:58.462
oh, no, it's really quite all
right for a friendly game.


329
00:19:58.497 --> 00:20:01.399
We mustn't let a minor thing
like that deprive April


330
00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:04.068
the pleasure of seeing
you play, must we?


331
00:20:04.103 --> 00:20:06.738
Just don't tell Sir Humphrey.

332
00:20:06.773 --> 00:20:07.805
My doctor.

333
00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:10.475
Three o'clock?

334
00:20:11.008 --> 00:20:12.610
And you must both
consider yourselves


335
00:20:13.144 --> 00:20:15.012
to be my guests afterwards.

336
00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.846
Your guests?
Oh, I insist.


337
00:20:16.881 --> 00:20:20.084
It's only fair seeing that I've
been your guest this evening.


338
00:20:23.821 --> 00:20:25.423
We'll wait for you in the lobby.

339
00:20:50.515 --> 00:20:51.582
Sorry.

340
00:20:55.853 --> 00:20:57.455
My gloves, please.

341
00:20:59.056 --> 00:21:00.658
Thank you.

342
00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:03.862
Yes, erm...

343
00:21:04.396 --> 00:21:07.065
yes, well, er...
thank you very much.


344
00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:08.667
Good night.

345
00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.106
Taxi, sir?

346
00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:19.309
Erm, no, no, erm... no, thanks.

347
00:21:19.344 --> 00:21:23.615
I thought you might like to take
a little stroll. Ha ha.


348
00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.768
So nice out tonight.
Yes, of course.


349
00:21:25.803 --> 00:21:27.886
I'd like to offer you both
a lift,


350
00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.521
but I've only got
a two-seater.


351
00:21:30.556 --> 00:21:33.225
That's the most wonderful car
I ever saw.


352
00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.360
The new Bellini 3.6.

353
00:21:35.561 --> 00:21:39.097
I could offer one of you a lift.

354
00:21:39.132 --> 00:21:41.732
No, thanks. We'll walk.

355
00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:43.867
Pity, nice night for a drive,

356
00:21:43.902 --> 00:21:45.504
wind through the hair,
all that sort of thing.


357
00:21:45.539 --> 00:21:48.707
Yes, well, good night, Delauney.

358
00:21:48.742 --> 00:21:50.274
Good night, Mr. Delauney.

359
00:21:50.309 --> 00:21:52.444
It's been so nice meeting you.

360
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.181
The earth shook tonight.

361
00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:05.257
You know, I've often thought of
buying a car, but...


362
00:22:05.292 --> 00:22:06.859
well, then I think,

363
00:22:07.392 --> 00:22:08.959
silly, really.

364
00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:12.197
Buses and undergrounds and...

365
00:22:12.232 --> 00:22:14.298
taxis, erm...

366
00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:16.967
buses, and things.

367
00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:20.205
Yes, I suppose it would be
a bit silly, really.


368
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.807
I say!

369
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:23.907
I just had a brilliant idea.

370
00:22:23.942 --> 00:22:25.277
Why don't I pick up
our young lady


371
00:22:25.312 --> 00:22:26.612
and drive her to the club
tomorrow?


372
00:22:27.145 --> 00:22:28.480
Save her the bus fare.

373
00:22:28.515 --> 00:22:29.965
That won't be necessary.

374
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.416
You're in the book?
Uh-huh.


375
00:22:31.451 --> 00:22:33.018
2:30?
Delauney!


376
00:22:33.552 --> 00:22:35.153
Don't mention it old chap,
anytime.


377
00:22:35.188 --> 00:22:36.233
Splendid!

378
00:23:34.413 --> 00:23:36.548
She takes to the eye,
doesn't she?


379
00:23:36.583 --> 00:23:38.684
She certainly does.

380
00:23:39.217 --> 00:23:41.318
May I try the horn?
Certainly.


381
00:23:41.353 --> 00:23:44.556
Dudley, gentleman would like
to try the horn.


382
00:23:44.591 --> 00:23:47.759
The horn? Oh, yes,
certainly, sir.


383
00:23:48.827 --> 00:23:49.860
Yeah,

384
00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:52.030
it should give them
a fair warning.


385
00:23:52.065 --> 00:23:53.632
Ha ha ha!

386
00:23:56.336 --> 00:24:00.038
Beautiful tone, mellow,
more mellow than anything.


387
00:24:03.242 --> 00:24:04.275
I've got a temporary flex
in there.


388
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:06.411
It's not really wired
for excessive use.


389
00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:08.581
Oh, yes, one of the old-type
exhaustible horn,


390
00:24:08.616 --> 00:24:10.682
runs on the helical friction
principle.


391
00:24:10.717 --> 00:24:13.386
Oh, what's that?
Too complicated to explain.


392
00:24:13.421 --> 00:24:15.521
I mean either you know,
or you don't.


393
00:24:15.556 --> 00:24:17.622
Is she fast?
Is she fast?


394
00:24:17.657 --> 00:24:21.394
Timed around Silverstone,

395
00:24:21.429 --> 00:24:22.961
and yours truly at the wheel.

396
00:24:22.996 --> 00:24:26.466
And I drove her from Doncaster
to Newport, Monmouthshire,


397
00:24:26.501 --> 00:24:29.936
in 2 hours 17 minutes. That's
an average of over 70 per.


398
00:24:29.971 --> 00:24:31.502
Oh, but that's impossible.

399
00:24:31.537 --> 00:24:33.139
Not with the four-litre
Swiftmobile,


400
00:24:33.673 --> 00:24:34.706
twin ohc, you know.

401
00:24:34.741 --> 00:24:36.876
The pioneers of hemispherical
combustion chambers,


402
00:24:36.911 --> 00:24:37.944
these people.

403
00:24:38.478 --> 00:24:41.147
Well, name me one manufacturer
what brought it out previous.


404
00:24:41.182 --> 00:24:44.350
Oh, well, I don't really know.

405
00:24:44.884 --> 00:24:48.052
What year is she?

406
00:24:48.087 --> 00:24:51.290
With this sort of car,
age is really of no account.


407
00:24:51.325 --> 00:24:54.494
Between you and me, she's
a little late for my taste.


408
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:56.629
If I didn't know the car,
I'd have my doubts.


409
00:24:57.163 --> 00:24:59.298
1922 was a really big year.

410
00:24:59.333 --> 00:25:00.900
Erm, how about spares?

411
00:25:01.434 --> 00:25:03.001
Ha ha ha.

412
00:25:03.036 --> 00:25:05.171
Spares? You never need them,
my man.


413
00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:07.271
Well, is the company
still in existence?


414
00:25:07.306 --> 00:25:09.976
They went out of business
because they were too good.


415
00:25:10.011 --> 00:25:11.044
You'd never find this kind
of quality


416
00:25:11.577 --> 00:25:13.179
in a company that survived
the depression. Never.


417
00:25:13.214 --> 00:25:15.279
Never!
Never!


418
00:25:15.314 --> 00:25:19.052
Well, I was toying with the idea
of buying a new Bellini.


419
00:25:19.087 --> 00:25:20.653
Can't get them into the country,
old boy.


420
00:25:20.688 --> 00:25:22.220
The Bellini's a good motor

421
00:25:22.255 --> 00:25:23.821
if you have Bellini mechanics
around,


422
00:25:23.856 --> 00:25:25.992
but is it worth the hard cash
you have to lay out?


423
00:25:26.027 --> 00:25:27.025
No!

424
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.626
Now, with the old Swiftmobile,

425
00:25:28.661 --> 00:25:31.330
she may lose a few inches
in sheer getaway,


426
00:25:31.864 --> 00:25:33.431
but open her up
on the great west road


427
00:25:33.466 --> 00:25:37.203
and you have that lovely
soothing roar that will...


428
00:25:37.238 --> 00:25:39.338
how can I call it,
that swish of wind,


429
00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:41.439
that beautiful gentle yell

430
00:25:41.474 --> 00:25:45.211
of the old type of high-point
bevel transmission.


431
00:25:45.246 --> 00:25:47.880
When you drive her,
you know she's there.


432
00:25:47.915 --> 00:25:48.948
I mean, take that gearbox.

433
00:25:49.482 --> 00:25:52.151
You get the coarse rasp
as you change down,


434
00:25:52.186 --> 00:25:54.821
and then the familiar
deep-throated grind


435
00:25:55.354 --> 00:25:56.387
as you move away.

436
00:25:56.422 --> 00:26:00.693
And a real wonder, the brake
snatch adjusted really hard...


437
00:26:00.728 --> 00:26:03.914
not hard, Dunstan, solid.

438
00:26:03.949 --> 00:26:07.065
A really solid drive.

439
00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.167
What are you asking for her?

440
00:26:08.701 --> 00:26:10.303
Dirt cheap, a sacrifice, sir.

441
00:26:10.338 --> 00:26:11.869
Can't be repeated.

442
00:26:11.904 --> 00:26:14.040
The property of a maharaja.

443
00:26:14.574 --> 00:26:17.777
The, er, Maharaja of...
Fawzigadore,


444
00:26:17.812 --> 00:26:18.810
nephew of the cricketer.

445
00:26:18.845 --> 00:26:20.446
Erm, what are you
asking for her?


446
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.081
We had new wheels
made to fit all the tyres.


447
00:26:23.116 --> 00:26:25.785
Look at the stuff that's gone
into that, sheer metal.


448
00:26:26.319 --> 00:26:27.920
Yes, but what are you
asking for her?


449
00:26:28.454 --> 00:26:29.789
Well, we're just getting
down to that.


450
00:26:29.824 --> 00:26:31.089
Actually, we're selling it
at a loss.


451
00:26:31.124 --> 00:26:34.861
We spent 750 nicker on her.
Pounds, Dudley.


452
00:26:34.896 --> 00:26:36.996
Pounds.
Oh, but that means...


453
00:26:37.031 --> 00:26:38.563
not necessarily.

454
00:26:38.598 --> 00:26:42.300
We like our cars going to
good homes, like dogs.


455
00:26:42.335 --> 00:26:44.470
So we're prepared to sell at
the ridiculous figure of...


456
00:26:44.505 --> 00:26:47.105
725 pounds.

457
00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.240
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

458
00:26:49.275 --> 00:26:52.977
715, making 715 pounds.
I'm sorry.


459
00:26:53.012 --> 00:26:55.148
Ah, you're weakening, you've
fallen in love with her,


460
00:26:55.183 --> 00:26:56.749
like we did at the start,
remember?


461
00:26:56.784 --> 00:27:00.486
Remember? Oh ho ho ho.

462
00:27:01.554 --> 00:27:02.888
700.

463
00:27:02.923 --> 00:27:04.189
Well...

464
00:27:04.224 --> 00:27:07.427
695 guineas and that's
the rock bottom.


465
00:27:19.706 --> 00:27:21.308
All right.
Done.


466
00:27:21.842 --> 00:27:23.443
Start the car up
for the gentleman, Dunstan.


467
00:27:23.478 --> 00:27:24.476
Yep.

468
00:27:24.511 --> 00:27:26.612
Make the check out to bearer
if you don't mind.


469
00:27:26.647 --> 00:27:30.384
And please don't cross it, sir
it confuses our books.


470
00:27:56.009 --> 00:27:57.611
May the 21st.

471
00:27:57.646 --> 00:27:59.213
Hmm? Oh, yes.

472
00:28:15.762 --> 00:28:16.830
There we are.

473
00:28:18.432 --> 00:28:20.567
Thank you very much.
Thank you, sir.


474
00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.575
Well, she's all yours.
Here's the logbook


475
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:30.711
hop in.
Oh, thank you.


476
00:28:35.515 --> 00:28:37.082
Now, there's one point to
remember.


477
00:28:37.117 --> 00:28:39.253
Don't hang on to the gear lever
after you've changed.


478
00:28:39.288 --> 00:28:41.353
She is liable to kick back.

479
00:28:41.388 --> 00:28:45.125
Don't worry about your exhaust
fumes, it's quite normal.


480
00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:46.692
And when you apply
the foot brake,


481
00:28:46.727 --> 00:28:49.129
it is advisable to apply
the handbrake as well.


482
00:28:49.164 --> 00:28:51.496
And the floorboards work
on the pivot principle.


483
00:28:51.531 --> 00:28:53.667
It's liable to give you a star
when you're not used to it.


484
00:28:53.702 --> 00:28:54.700
Oh! Ha ha.

485
00:28:54.735 --> 00:28:57.404
Well, thank you both
very much indeed.


486
00:29:05.412 --> 00:29:07.547
Bon voyage!
See you again!


487
00:30:58.059 --> 00:30:59.127
I say, I'm frightfully sorry
I'm late, April.


488
00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.693
Oh, that's all right.

489
00:31:00.728 --> 00:31:02.330
It's very pleasant sitting
out here in the sun.


490
00:31:02.365 --> 00:31:04.465
That's all settled.
Shall we play?


491
00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.601
Erm, yes, of course.

492
00:31:08.736 --> 00:31:10.872
Could I drive you home
after the game, April?


493
00:31:11.406 --> 00:31:13.541
Drive?
I have a surprise for you.


494
00:31:14.075 --> 00:31:16.175
You haven't bought a car?
Mm.


495
00:31:16.210 --> 00:31:19.379
Get a move on.
Er, yes, of course.


496
00:31:19.414 --> 00:31:21.015
Erm, would you care to
come down with us?


497
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:22.617
Mm-hm.

498
00:31:31.692 --> 00:31:33.294
Thank you.

499
00:31:37.031 --> 00:31:39.700
Call.
Rough.


500
00:31:39.735 --> 00:31:41.302
Smooth.

501
00:31:41.836 --> 00:31:43.403
I'll take this end.

502
00:31:43.438 --> 00:31:45.573
No need to change, is there?

503
00:31:45.608 --> 00:31:47.708
All right.

504
00:31:48.242 --> 00:31:50.343
My serve, then.

505
00:31:50.378 --> 00:31:52.513
I'm afraid I am a bit
out of practice.


506
00:31:52.548 --> 00:31:54.115
So am I.

507
00:31:55.183 --> 00:31:58.920
Would you like 15 start
or shall we play level?


508
00:31:58.955 --> 00:32:00.521
Level!

509
00:32:02.123 --> 00:32:04.792
Good luck.
No partisanship, little lady.


510
00:32:04.827 --> 00:32:06.359
Wish Palfrey good luck too.

511
00:32:06.394 --> 00:32:08.796
Aren't you standing rather
close to the net?


512
00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:11.199
No, it's my game.
I move back for the second.


513
00:32:11.234 --> 00:32:13.334
All right.

514
00:32:26.681 --> 00:32:27.748
Hard cheese!

515
00:32:30.418 --> 00:32:32.553
Aren't you going to
move back a bit?


516
00:32:32.588 --> 00:32:34.689
No, I've changed my mind.

517
00:32:39.494 --> 00:32:41.629
Hard cheese! Love-15.

518
00:32:50.171 --> 00:32:51.772
Hard cheese!

519
00:32:57.111 --> 00:32:58.179
Out, but I'll take it.

520
00:33:01.916 --> 00:33:03.784
Hard cheese!
Good shot.


521
00:33:03.819 --> 00:33:05.619
What is it? Love-30.

522
00:33:05.654 --> 00:33:08.323
Didn't deserve it.
Rotten stroke.


523
00:33:11.527 --> 00:33:13.128
Hard cheese!

524
00:33:16.331 --> 00:33:17.933
Oh. Hard cheese!

525
00:33:17.968 --> 00:33:19.535
Love-40.

526
00:33:20.602 --> 00:33:22.203
Service.

527
00:33:22.238 --> 00:33:23.805
Ready.

528
00:33:24.873 --> 00:33:27.009
Out! Hard cheese!

529
00:33:31.813 --> 00:33:32.563
Oh!

530
00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:34.448
So sorry.

531
00:33:34.483 --> 00:33:37.152
Oh, I say,
smashing cricket stroke.


532
00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:41.957
Well, that's... one-love.

533
00:33:42.491 --> 00:33:44.092
Sure you wouldn't like
that handicap?


534
00:33:44.127 --> 00:33:44.842
No!

535
00:33:53.702 --> 00:33:56.905
Were you ready?
Not really.


536
00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:59.575
Ready now?
Right.


537
00:34:05.981 --> 00:34:07.315
Good shot, Henry.

538
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:08.650
Thank you, April.

539
00:34:08.685 --> 00:34:10.252
Oh! Oh!

540
00:34:31.607 --> 00:34:32.674
Hard cheese!

541
00:34:38.547 --> 00:34:40.148
15-love.

542
00:34:43.885 --> 00:34:46.555
Ready?
Right!


543
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.495
Were you ready?

544
00:34:54.029 --> 00:34:56.698
Did you say yes?
Yes!


545
00:34:56.733 --> 00:34:58.265
30-love.

546
00:34:58.300 --> 00:34:59.866
Pretty spin you put on them.

547
00:34:59.901 --> 00:35:03.105
No, not really.
Court's a bit uneven.


548
00:35:17.519 --> 00:35:19.121
Oh!
My game.


549
00:35:19.655 --> 00:35:21.256
And set.

550
00:35:26.061 --> 00:35:27.628
Sorry to keep you waiting,
dear girl,


551
00:35:27.663 --> 00:35:31.400
but we had to get our friend
Palfrey here patched up a bit.


552
00:35:31.435 --> 00:35:33.535
Ready to go?
Yes, erm, shall we go?


553
00:35:33.570 --> 00:35:36.703
Of course, your new car.

554
00:35:36.738 --> 00:35:38.874
I didn't think you'd
get one so soon, Henry.


555
00:35:46.882 --> 00:35:49.818
Ha ha ha!
What on earth's that?


556
00:35:49.853 --> 00:35:52.754
Looks like
a Polish stomach pump.


557
00:35:52.789 --> 00:35:54.890
Let's go and look at it.

558
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.965
What sort of an idiot would
drive a thing like this?


559
00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.636
Yes, what sort of an idiot...

560
00:36:06.671 --> 00:36:09.804
Henry, is this...?

561
00:36:09.839 --> 00:36:13.007
Oh, no, no, of course not.

562
00:36:13.042 --> 00:36:15.712
I wouldn't be fool enough
to buy a car like that.


563
00:36:16.245 --> 00:36:17.313
Well, where is yours?

564
00:36:17.647 --> 00:36:22.118
Er, well, it doesn't appear
to have arrived yet. I...


565
00:36:22.153 --> 00:36:23.186
well, you can't
expect Miss Smith


566
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.855
to hang around
all day, can you?


567
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:27.422
Oh, I don't mind waiting.

568
00:36:27.457 --> 00:36:30.091
No, no, no, it doesn't matter.

569
00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:32.795
Delauney is quite right.
You mustn't wait.


570
00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.465
But, I...
no, no, no, I insist, really.


571
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.099
Splendid!

572
00:36:38.134 --> 00:36:39.701
I know a little place
down in the river


573
00:36:39.736 --> 00:36:42.405
where we might have a swim.
Do you like swimming?


574
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.573
Mmm.
Splendid!


575
00:36:45.608 --> 00:36:47.175
I know a charming little pub

576
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:49.345
where we might have some
dinner afterwards.


577
00:37:30.987 --> 00:37:32.019
And that's how it happened.

578
00:37:32.054 --> 00:37:34.724
In fact, that's how
everything always happens,


579
00:37:34.759 --> 00:37:36.325
and then I saw your
advertisement.


580
00:37:36.859 --> 00:37:38.461
Well, what you've just
told me amounts to this,


581
00:37:38.995 --> 00:37:40.596
that you find yourself
constantly


582
00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:44.333
in a one-down position
to the world in general,


583
00:37:44.368 --> 00:37:47.003
and to this young female
in particular.


584
00:37:47.537 --> 00:37:49.103
Oh, well, before we go
any further,


585
00:37:49.138 --> 00:37:52.341
I think I ought to mention
the little matter of fees.


586
00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:54.477
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

587
00:37:55.011 --> 00:37:56.577
Yes, well, these vary,
of course,


588
00:37:56.612 --> 00:37:59.247
according to the needs
of the individual,


589
00:37:59.282 --> 00:38:01.951
rates of progress and so on,
but in all cases,


590
00:38:02.485 --> 00:38:07.824
we ask for a registration fee
of 250 pounds,


591
00:38:07.859 --> 00:38:09.959
paid in advance, of course.

592
00:38:10.493 --> 00:38:14.230
This fairly substantial sum is
the first psychological process


593
00:38:14.265 --> 00:38:19.052
we bring to bear on the student
to encourage him,


594
00:38:19.087 --> 00:38:23.840
to associate himself with...
with the effort.


595
00:38:23.875 --> 00:38:25.975
It is in fact...

596
00:38:26.509 --> 00:38:29.712
well, it's part of
the treatment.


597
00:38:29.747 --> 00:38:31.279
I see.

598
00:38:31.314 --> 00:38:32.880
Oh, well, erm...

599
00:38:32.915 --> 00:38:34.517
I'd better write you a cheque.

600
00:38:37.186 --> 00:38:39.322
I'm sorry I haven't a pen.

601
00:38:39.357 --> 00:38:40.923
It's all right.

602
00:38:46.262 --> 00:38:48.931
That's a very handsome
one of yours. May I see it?


603
00:38:48.966 --> 00:38:51.601
No, no, no,
when you're finished.


604
00:38:59.275 --> 00:39:01.744
Now, I hope you notice that
I do not stand hovering over you


605
00:39:01.779 --> 00:39:05.499
with a pen ready whenever I want
you to sign a document


606
00:39:05.534 --> 00:39:09.219
in my favour. On the contrary,
I get you to use your own.


607
00:39:09.254 --> 00:39:12.956
Erm, excuse me. Could I?

608
00:39:12.991 --> 00:39:15.092
What?
The pen.


609
00:39:16.693 --> 00:39:18.794
Well?

610
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:20.964
Could I have it back, please?

611
00:39:22.032 --> 00:39:24.132
Of course.

612
00:39:24.167 --> 00:39:26.302
Sorry.
Ah, you're sorry.


613
00:39:26.337 --> 00:39:28.403
That was lesson number two.

614
00:39:28.438 --> 00:39:31.642
I managed to make you feel
apologetic and somehow mean


615
00:39:31.677 --> 00:39:33.208
by forcing you into a choice

616
00:39:33.243 --> 00:39:34.810
between losing
a valued possession


617
00:39:34.845 --> 00:39:38.582
or indirectly accusing me
of trying to steal it. You see?


618
00:39:38.617 --> 00:39:41.750
I see. Yes.
Good, good.


619
00:39:41.785 --> 00:39:44.187
Well, Mr. Palfrey, I think
you're about ready


620
00:39:44.222 --> 00:39:46.555
to start the course in earnest.
Let me see now.


621
00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:50.861
Yes, you are just in time
for the Partymanship class.


622
00:39:50.896 --> 00:39:52.462
Good afternoon, Palfrey.

623
00:39:52.497 --> 00:39:54.563
Good afternoon.

624
00:39:54.598 --> 00:39:56.733
Oh, erm, thank you for the tea.

625
00:40:04.207 --> 00:40:07.910
Now, one of the basic areas
in which a Lifeman


626
00:40:07.945 --> 00:40:11.682
must put his Lifemanship into
play is the social gathering,


627
00:40:11.717 --> 00:40:14.351
or, as it's sometimes
called, the party.


628
00:40:14.386 --> 00:40:16.504
Sooner or later
during the party,


629
00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:18.622
one person begins to dominate.

630
00:40:18.657 --> 00:40:20.757
That person must be you.

631
00:40:21.291 --> 00:40:24.494
Does anybody know
an amusing story?


632
00:40:25.028 --> 00:40:26.096
I do, sir.
Good.


633
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:29.264
Well, suppose this were a party,

634
00:40:29.299 --> 00:40:33.570
and suppose that dingle here
has been having rather a success


635
00:40:33.605 --> 00:40:35.706
with his font of
amusing stories.


636
00:40:35.741 --> 00:40:38.392
What would the Lifeman do?

637
00:40:38.427 --> 00:40:41.044
Leave and go to another party.

638
00:40:41.079 --> 00:40:43.679
No, Fleetsnod.

639
00:40:43.714 --> 00:40:48.518
The true Lifeman
would rather die first.


640
00:40:49.052 --> 00:40:51.722
He stops the flow.

641
00:40:52.255 --> 00:40:53.323
To demonstrate...

642
00:40:53.857 --> 00:40:57.594
Dingle, tell us your
amusing story.


643
00:40:57.629 --> 00:41:00.228
Well, there was this chap,

644
00:41:00.263 --> 00:41:03.467
had a bit too much to drink,
if you know what I mean.


645
00:41:03.502 --> 00:41:04.499
Well, sir,

646
00:41:04.534 --> 00:41:06.101
he finds himself walking home

647
00:41:06.136 --> 00:41:10.407
with one foot on the curb
and one foot on the road.


648
00:41:15.746 --> 00:41:16.813
Looks down and says,

649
00:41:17.347 --> 00:41:19.483
"My word, that's funny.
When I left home this morning,


650
00:41:19.518 --> 00:41:22.152
"they were both
the same length!"


651
00:41:26.423 --> 00:41:28.025
Very good, Dingle.

652
00:41:30.694 --> 00:41:32.295
Most amusing.

653
00:41:33.363 --> 00:41:34.965
Where did I leave my pipe?

654
00:41:38.702 --> 00:41:40.303
Sir!

655
00:41:42.439 --> 00:41:44.574
I'm most terribly sorry.

656
00:41:44.609 --> 00:41:47.209
I'd no idea.

657
00:41:47.244 --> 00:41:48.810
It's quite all right, Dingle.

658
00:41:48.845 --> 00:41:50.713
You couldn't have known
about this


659
00:41:50.748 --> 00:41:53.533
old war wound of mine,
could you?


660
00:41:53.568 --> 00:41:56.284
No, sir.
Feeling bad, Dingle?


661
00:41:56.319 --> 00:41:59.523
Feel like telling another story,
Dingle?


662
00:42:01.124 --> 00:42:02.157
You see, gentlemen,

663
00:42:02.192 --> 00:42:04.861
the flow has been stopped.

664
00:42:18.209 --> 00:42:19.209
Out!

665
00:42:20.379 --> 00:42:23.513
Now, what's your move?

666
00:42:23.548 --> 00:42:25.950
Did you say in or out, sir?

667
00:42:25.985 --> 00:42:28.352
Well, I thought it was out.

668
00:42:28.886 --> 00:42:30.488
But would you care to
have it again?


669
00:42:30.523 --> 00:42:32.055
No, just in future,

670
00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:34.759
would you kindly state
in a loud and clear voice


671
00:42:34.794 --> 00:42:37.179
whether the ball is in or out?

672
00:42:37.214 --> 00:42:39.529
Hmm, you're getting it, Palfrey.

673
00:42:39.564 --> 00:42:41.664
Now, suppose you are
completely outclassed,


674
00:42:41.699 --> 00:42:44.368
and your one chance is in taking
your opponent's eye off the ball,


675
00:42:44.902 --> 00:42:47.572
and keeping it off.
Go on. Let's see what you do.


676
00:42:47.607 --> 00:42:49.707
Hmm?
Right.


677
00:42:58.783 --> 00:43:00.918
I'm so sorry. Ha ha.

678
00:43:00.953 --> 00:43:02.520
Sweaty hands.

679
00:43:03.588 --> 00:43:05.189
Is it bleeding much?

680
00:43:11.062 --> 00:43:14.799
Let us assume that Proudfoot
here has made a break of 8


681
00:43:14.834 --> 00:43:18.536
and looks as if he is going on
to make 8 more.


682
00:43:18.571 --> 00:43:20.138
Erm, would you mind?

683
00:43:23.341 --> 00:43:24.942
Just a minute.

684
00:43:27.612 --> 00:43:29.213
That's better.

685
00:43:30.815 --> 00:43:32.416
Are they bothering you at all?

686
00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:33.983
Who?

687
00:43:34.018 --> 00:43:35.620
Dingle and Brazier?

688
00:43:40.958 --> 00:43:43.094
I'm sorry. Go ahead.

689
00:43:45.229 --> 00:43:46.831
Shhh.

690
00:43:47.899 --> 00:43:49.500
Bad luck, Proudfoot.

691
00:43:49.535 --> 00:43:51.636
Four to me.

692
00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.109
You mean you do your
own cooking?


693
00:43:59.144 --> 00:44:01.779
Oh, yes, and washing-up
and all that.


694
00:44:01.814 --> 00:44:04.982
Well, it's quite fun, really.

695
00:44:05.017 --> 00:44:08.151
Henry?
Mm-hm?


696
00:44:08.186 --> 00:44:10.286
You have a hole in your sock.

697
00:44:10.321 --> 00:44:14.058
Oh, I'm afraid I'm not
very good at darning yet,


698
00:44:14.093 --> 00:44:17.261
but I'm learning, you know.

699
00:44:17.795 --> 00:44:19.896
Oh, poor Henry!

700
00:44:19.931 --> 00:44:24.735
It's not right for you to do
your own washing and cooking.


701
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:27.939
I wish I could come
and do it for you.


702
00:44:27.974 --> 00:44:31.107
Oh, I do wish you would.

703
00:44:31.142 --> 00:44:33.811
How would tomorrow evening suit?

704
00:44:37.548 --> 00:44:40.716
That's fine, Mr. Palfrey, fine

705
00:44:40.751 --> 00:44:43.955
you're ready to move on
to the next class.


706
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:46.090
Thank you, Mrs. Grimmet.

707
00:44:53.564 --> 00:44:55.700
Well, Palfrey, having
used various ploys


708
00:44:55.735 --> 00:44:57.301
with which you are now familiar,

709
00:44:57.835 --> 00:45:00.504
let us imagine that here she is
alone with you in your flat.


710
00:45:00.539 --> 00:45:04.242
Her little heart a-flutter
and a-tremble.


711
00:45:04.277 --> 00:45:05.274
What then is your next move?

712
00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:06.877
Well, we have a
little gadget here,


713
00:45:06.912 --> 00:45:10.649
which we developed in our
early days at Yeovil.


714
00:45:11.183 --> 00:45:13.283
Ah, there it is.

715
00:45:13.318 --> 00:45:16.521
What your follow-through
might be is no concern of mine.


716
00:45:16.556 --> 00:45:20.009
However, it has two serious
disadvantages.


717
00:45:20.044 --> 00:45:22.820
First, it smacks a little
of impatience, hmm?


718
00:45:22.855 --> 00:45:25.597
And secondly, it is by no means
inexpensive.


719
00:45:26.131 --> 00:45:28.800
So, except for our wealthier
and less patient students,


720
00:45:29.334 --> 00:45:33.071
we recommend a subtler
and more economic ploy.


721
00:45:34.673 --> 00:45:36.541
Well, now, I'll try to
give you an example


722
00:45:36.576 --> 00:45:38.375
of what might happen
if luck is on your side.


723
00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:42.681
You offer her a drink, which
we'll assume she accepts.


724
00:45:42.716 --> 00:45:43.749
A reasonable assumption.

725
00:45:44.283 --> 00:45:46.418
So, let's imagine that this
glass is filled to the brim


726
00:45:46.453 --> 00:45:48.020
with some refreshing liquid,

727
00:45:48.553 --> 00:45:52.557
having made sure that the part
she is going to hold it by


728
00:45:52.592 --> 00:45:56.561
has been treated so that it is
very, very slippery indeed.


729
00:45:56.596 --> 00:45:58.128
Why?
Because, Palfrey,


730
00:45:58.163 --> 00:46:02.434
we are hoping for the best of
all possible accidents. Barbara.


731
00:46:02.469 --> 00:46:04.534
Ooh!
Ha ha ha! Palfrey,


732
00:46:04.569 --> 00:46:06.704
your luck is in,
look, it has worked.


733
00:46:06.739 --> 00:46:08.805
The glass has
slipped out of her hand


734
00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.510
and she spilt the stuff
all down her dress.


735
00:46:11.545 --> 00:46:13.111
You, of course,
are frightfully upset,


736
00:46:13.645 --> 00:46:15.247
but the main point is that you
cannot let her stand around


737
00:46:15.781 --> 00:46:17.881
with a wet dress on now,
can you, hmm?


738
00:46:17.916 --> 00:46:20.017
No, of course you can't,
so being a gentleman,


739
00:46:20.052 --> 00:46:23.255
you offer her your dressing gown
while her dress is drying,


740
00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:27.526
and that I think places you
quite definitely one up,


741
00:46:27.561 --> 00:46:29.127
if not more.

742
00:46:29.661 --> 00:46:32.331
According to just how much
of a gentleman you are.


743
00:46:32.366 --> 00:46:36.068
Well, Palfrey,
the dressing gown!


744
00:46:36.103 --> 00:46:38.203
Palfrey, the dressing...

745
00:46:41.406 --> 00:46:43.542
Palfrey!
Hmm?


746
00:46:44.076 --> 00:46:47.279
Oh, er, yes, dressing gown.

747
00:46:53.685 --> 00:46:55.786
Well, gentlemen, having
delivered myself of these


748
00:46:55.821 --> 00:46:58.490
qualified congratulations,
I think you are now ready to


749
00:46:58.525 --> 00:47:00.590
move on to the second phase
of our work.


750
00:47:00.625 --> 00:47:03.828
From the theory to the practice
of Lifemanship,


751
00:47:03.863 --> 00:47:06.997
or, as we say here at Yeovil,
to the field trials.


752
00:47:07.032 --> 00:47:09.701
Each of you in turn will now
proceed to the archives room


753
00:47:10.235 --> 00:47:11.303
where you will find
photographic records


754
00:47:11.837 --> 00:47:13.937
of all known anti
-Lifemen,

755
00:47:13.972 --> 00:47:16.108
and from these
you will select your opponents,


756
00:47:16.143 --> 00:47:18.208
and, under the guidance
of an instructor,


757
00:47:18.243 --> 00:47:22.514
proceed into the outside world
there to cross swords with them.


758
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:24.649
Come along, Palfrey, you first.

759
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:48.673
It's him, that bloke we sold
the Swiftmobile to.


760
00:47:48.708 --> 00:47:50.240
What? Is he alone?

761
00:47:50.275 --> 00:47:51.877
He's got the car with him.

762
00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.180
I say, sir.

763
00:47:57.215 --> 00:47:59.351
Yours?
Yes, yes.


764
00:48:04.156 --> 00:48:06.291
Do you mind if I look inside?

765
00:48:06.826 --> 00:48:08.926
Thanks.
There we are.


766
00:48:08.961 --> 00:48:12.698
How about that
for an engine, eh?


767
00:48:12.733 --> 00:48:13.766
Marvellous job.

768
00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.902
He's waving to us.
No, he isn't.


769
00:48:16.436 --> 00:48:18.037
He's shaking his fist.

770
00:48:19.105 --> 00:48:20.671
The, erm...

771
00:48:20.706 --> 00:48:22.807
when you get round
the other side,


772
00:48:22.842 --> 00:48:24.977
look as if you're making me
an offer, will you?


773
00:48:25.012 --> 00:48:26.544
Anything you say.

774
00:48:26.579 --> 00:48:28.714
Come and have a look
at the altimeter.


775
00:48:32.452 --> 00:48:34.587
I don't suppose you'd
part with her, eh?


776
00:48:34.622 --> 00:48:37.221
Ah ha ha, no, no, no, no.

777
00:48:37.256 --> 00:48:39.926
I've had so many offers for
this car, I can't tell you.


778
00:48:39.961 --> 00:48:42.595
But I'm not selling.
Do you mind if I, er...?


779
00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:43.628
No, no, no, help yourself,

780
00:48:43.663 --> 00:48:45.798
by all means,
have a good look around.


781
00:48:45.833 --> 00:48:48.433
Good morning, chaps.

782
00:48:48.468 --> 00:48:50.069
Thought I'd bring the old girl
back to show you.


783
00:48:50.104 --> 00:48:51.636
We never guaranteed anything.

784
00:48:51.671 --> 00:48:53.539
No, you can't touch us.
We're insured.


785
00:48:53.574 --> 00:48:55.558
What did you say you got
out of her? 112?


786
00:48:55.593 --> 00:48:57.543
I never said anything.
Dunstan let her out.


787
00:48:57.578 --> 00:48:59.145
He's not good at figures.

788
00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:02.348
I had her up to 115.

789
00:49:02.882 --> 00:49:03.950
What?

790
00:49:04.484 --> 00:49:06.584
On Western Avenue. Easy.

791
00:49:06.619 --> 00:49:09.288
Raced a brand-new Jag all
the way from Northolt to Ealing.


792
00:49:09.822 --> 00:49:11.389
You know, I honestly believe

793
00:49:11.424 --> 00:49:13.025
you chaps don't know
what that car really is.


794
00:49:13.559 --> 00:49:15.695
She's a Swiftmobile 1924.

795
00:49:16.229 --> 00:49:18.329
You really believe that?
Yeah.


796
00:49:18.364 --> 00:49:22.101
I mean you had no idea what it
was you were selling me?


797
00:49:22.635 --> 00:49:25.838
Always collects a crowd,
she does.


798
00:49:25.873 --> 00:49:27.939
She's not a Swiftmobile 1924.

799
00:49:27.974 --> 00:49:30.643
She's one of the
Swiftmobiles, 1925,


800
00:49:30.678 --> 00:49:32.210
a supercharged Ravalli model.

801
00:49:32.245 --> 00:49:34.380
Oh, superficially,
like a run-of-the-mill '24,


802
00:49:34.914 --> 00:49:37.583
I grant you, but, ha ha,
one look at the valve seats...


803
00:49:37.618 --> 00:49:38.651
didn't tell you, Dunstan?

804
00:49:39.185 --> 00:49:40.751
I don't get it.
Will you talk English?


805
00:49:40.786 --> 00:49:42.353
Of course, I had a bit of
trouble with her at first.


806
00:49:42.388 --> 00:49:45.057
You chaps have been trying to
run her on ordinary petrol.


807
00:49:45.092 --> 00:49:47.692
She takes a petrol-meths mixture
like the old Borottis.


808
00:49:47.727 --> 00:49:50.930
And then the multi-hydro nuts on
the brakes were all oiled up


809
00:49:50.965 --> 00:49:52.497
and the special two-way camshaft
was bent.


810
00:49:52.532 --> 00:49:55.201
Ha! No wonder the steering was
all to pieces, ha!


811
00:49:55.236 --> 00:49:57.301
So, I've had her stripped
right down and...


812
00:49:57.336 --> 00:50:00.005
well, now I reckon that car is
practically priceless.


813
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.675
In fact, I've already been
offered almost three times


814
00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:03.743
what I gave for her
by brassy digger.


815
00:50:04.277 --> 00:50:05.309
The racing driver?

816
00:50:05.344 --> 00:50:09.615
He had her on the track at
Silverstone, lapped at 121.7.


817
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:11.182
I said to Dunstan.
Didn't I, Dunstan?


818
00:50:11.217 --> 00:50:13.317
I said, "I'd like
Mr. Palfrey to have that car,


819
00:50:13.352 --> 00:50:16.021
because he'll know how to handle
her, he'll appreciate her.


820
00:50:16.056 --> 00:50:18.975
Yes, that's right, that's why
we let you have her cheap.


821
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:20.986
We like our motorcars to go to
good homes, like dogs.


822
00:50:21.021 --> 00:50:22.962
Brassy is coming around here,
as a matter of fact,


823
00:50:23.496 --> 00:50:25.097
to see if you can
try and get him one.


824
00:50:25.132 --> 00:50:26.699
Oh, I told him it was
absolutely useless.


825
00:50:26.734 --> 00:50:28.266
Only 6 of them ever made.

826
00:50:28.301 --> 00:50:30.436
Well, you know him, when he's
set his heart on a thing,


827
00:50:30.471 --> 00:50:32.038
he is prepared to pay...

828
00:50:32.073 --> 00:50:33.639
oh, anything.

829
00:50:36.842 --> 00:50:38.978
Mind you, once you've
driven a car like that,


830
00:50:39.512 --> 00:50:42.181
Well, you have driven it.
There's no getting away from it.


831
00:50:42.216 --> 00:50:44.334
And what an experience it is.

832
00:50:44.369 --> 00:50:46.417
Well, I must be getting along.

833
00:50:46.452 --> 00:50:49.121
Wait a minute, Mr. Palfrey,
don't be in a rush.


834
00:50:49.156 --> 00:50:51.541
I've been thinking about
that car.


835
00:50:51.576 --> 00:50:53.891
It is a shade big for town work.

836
00:50:53.926 --> 00:50:56.027
Oh, I don't know.
Yes, that's right, sir


837
00:50:56.062 --> 00:50:59.265
that'll be more for a racing
driver, like Mr. Digger.


838
00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:00.866
I was saying to Dunstan,
wasn't I, Dunstan?


839
00:51:00.901 --> 00:51:02.433
You were, Dudley?

840
00:51:02.468 --> 00:51:05.137
I was saying I'm worried about
Mr. Palfrey having that car.


841
00:51:05.172 --> 00:51:07.274
I'm worried about him
parking it in town.


842
00:51:07.808 --> 00:51:11.011
I'm worried about him being
stopped for speeding.


843
00:51:11.046 --> 00:51:13.146
I mean, have you tried
driving her under 40,


844
00:51:13.181 --> 00:51:15.282
that's all I am asking,
have you tried?


845
00:51:15.317 --> 00:51:16.848
Yes, you want something smaller.

846
00:51:16.883 --> 00:51:19.019
Well, I mean, something
like this for instance.


847
00:51:19.386 --> 00:51:21.653
More your type of thing
altogether.


848
00:51:21.688 --> 00:51:24.358
We can do a straight swap,
nothing in the books.


849
00:51:24.891 --> 00:51:25.959
You're not seriously suggesting

850
00:51:26.493 --> 00:51:28.629
I should trade a Swiftmobile
for one of those.


851
00:51:28.664 --> 00:51:30.729
New one, mind you. Ex-works.

852
00:51:30.764 --> 00:51:33.433
No, no, Dunstan,
complete with engine.


853
00:51:33.468 --> 00:51:35.534
Oh, come, gentlemen.

854
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:37.170
Why, I could sell it
to Brassy myself.


855
00:51:37.205 --> 00:51:39.840
Ah, a new car and 10 pounds.

856
00:51:39.875 --> 00:51:41.406
Guineas.

857
00:51:41.441 --> 00:51:43.577
A new car and a 100 guineas
would be nearer the mark.


858
00:51:43.612 --> 00:51:45.178
It's a deal.
Do you want it in cash?


859
00:51:45.213 --> 00:51:46.745
Now, don't rush me.

860
00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:49.983
I shall probably finish up
by doing something I regret.


861
00:51:54.788 --> 00:51:56.923
Maybe she is a bit large
for town.


862
00:52:10.804 --> 00:52:12.939
Cash, did you say?
Cash.


863
00:52:12.974 --> 00:52:15.040
It's a deal.
Done!


864
00:52:15.075 --> 00:52:19.346
Dunstan, open the door
for the gentleman.


865
00:52:19.381 --> 00:52:22.514
Thank you.
There we are.


866
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:25.218
And believe me, sir,
you've made a very shrewd move.


867
00:52:25.253 --> 00:52:26.286
Excellent!

868
00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:27.853
The ignition key.
Thank you.


869
00:52:27.888 --> 00:52:30.290
Log book's in the pocket.
Thank you, gentlemen.


870
00:52:30.325 --> 00:52:32.693
Give my regards to Brassy
when you see him,


871
00:52:32.728 --> 00:52:34.259
and don't forget!

872
00:52:34.294 --> 00:52:36.963
One of petrol, two of meths.

873
00:52:41.234 --> 00:52:43.370
It's all theirs now, sir.

874
00:52:43.405 --> 00:52:44.971
Make them an offer.

875
00:52:55.115 --> 00:52:57.784
I'm sorry, sir,
this car is not for sale.


876
00:52:57.819 --> 00:52:59.920
Oh, lucky I'm not interested.

877
00:53:49.035 --> 00:53:51.136
Make yourself comfortable.

878
00:53:51.171 --> 00:53:53.840
Mr. Gloatbridge, could you come
in here for a moment, please.


879
00:53:54.374 --> 00:53:56.475
Unusually early this morning,
Mr. Henry.


880
00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:58.111
You know very well the mail
isn't sorted until...


881
00:53:58.146 --> 00:53:59.730
I'm not interested in the mail.

882
00:53:59.765 --> 00:54:01.279
Would you kindly come in here

883
00:54:01.314 --> 00:54:03.450
and bring the cash ledger
with you?


884
00:54:03.485 --> 00:54:05.051
Yes, Mr. Henry.

885
00:54:09.323 --> 00:54:11.459
You just talk a lot of
high finance and figures.


886
00:54:11.494 --> 00:54:13.559
Come!

887
00:54:13.594 --> 00:54:15.730
Some figures, you know.
Thank you.


888
00:54:17.865 --> 00:54:19.467
Of capitalisation...
just one moment.


889
00:54:19.502 --> 00:54:20.500
12 and a half?

890
00:54:20.535 --> 00:54:21.602
12 and a half is very
reasonable, I should say.


891
00:54:21.637 --> 00:54:24.272
About 2.7, very well done.

892
00:54:24.307 --> 00:54:26.941
Right. Ha ha.

893
00:54:26.976 --> 00:54:27.691
Ah!

894
00:54:29.645 --> 00:54:33.347
Er, cigarette, Mr. Gloatbridge?

895
00:54:33.881 --> 00:54:36.017
I haven't smoked for

896
00:54:36.052 --> 00:54:37.049
No?

897
00:54:37.084 --> 00:54:39.185
I've practically
given it up myself,


898
00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:44.025
but I still find it helps me
at, erm... difficult moments.


899
00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:45.626
You sure you won't change
your mind?


900
00:54:45.661 --> 00:54:48.296
No, thank you, Mr. Henry.

901
00:54:48.331 --> 00:54:49.862
Gloatbridge.

902
00:54:49.897 --> 00:54:53.634
What would you think
about a merger with ACI?


903
00:54:53.669 --> 00:54:57.371
A merger, sir? With the
biggest firm in the city?


904
00:54:57.406 --> 00:54:59.472
Mr. Henry, you can't be serious.

905
00:54:59.507 --> 00:55:01.909
Probably nothing will come
of it. I haven't decided yet.


906
00:55:01.944 --> 00:55:04.312
But I've been having some
discussions on a very high level.


907
00:55:04.347 --> 00:55:06.412
These few weeks I've been away.

908
00:55:06.447 --> 00:55:11.252
Sir John Carruthers, the
chairman of ACI seems very keen.


909
00:55:11.287 --> 00:55:12.320
I can only say, Mr. Henry,

910
00:55:12.854 --> 00:55:16.057
that I don't think your uncle
would've been very keen.


911
00:55:16.092 --> 00:55:19.225
My uncle, Gloatbridge, being
dead, is hardly in a position


912
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:24.065
to express an opinion, nor is he
in full possession of the facts.


913
00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:26.165
May I see that ledger?

914
00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:28.870
Really, Mr. Henry, I always
understood that no major policy


915
00:55:28.905 --> 00:55:31.539
decisions would be taken
without consulting me.


916
00:55:31.574 --> 00:55:34.208
I've been with this firm
for 32 years now,


917
00:55:34.243 --> 00:55:35.810
and that's a very long time.

918
00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:39.013
32 years.
Have you really?


919
00:55:39.547 --> 00:55:42.216
That is indeed as you say
a very long time, Gloatbridge,


920
00:55:42.251 --> 00:55:43.818
perhaps almost...

921
00:55:44.886 --> 00:55:48.089
Oh, well, may I see the ledger?

922
00:55:50.224 --> 00:55:54.495
Thank you. Just get me last
year's as well, would you?


923
00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:56.097
Yes, Mr. Henry.

924
00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:08.376
Not bad, not bad at all.

925
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:10.476
I liked the merger idea,

926
00:56:10.511 --> 00:56:13.180
and I also enjoyed the
suggestion that I was.


927
00:56:13.215 --> 00:56:14.747
Sir John Carruthers.

928
00:56:14.782 --> 00:56:18.519
Though the Chairman's name
happens to be Abe Spoonforth.


929
00:56:18.554 --> 00:56:22.256
I see you can't use kid gloves
with a man like Gloatbridge.


930
00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:25.459
I suppose, you know,
there's an obvious move now.


931
00:56:25.494 --> 00:56:27.560
I know.

932
00:56:27.595 --> 00:56:30.264
A slight addition...

933
00:56:31.866 --> 00:56:34.001
here?

934
00:56:34.535 --> 00:56:37.169
Well, of course.

935
00:56:37.204 --> 00:56:43.077
Thanks to your interpolated
accountancy class.


936
00:56:43.112 --> 00:56:45.764
Ah. Erm, Gloatbridge,

937
00:56:45.799 --> 00:56:48.381
I may be wrong, but...

938
00:56:48.416 --> 00:56:51.085
just check that total for me,
would you, please?


939
00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.971
Yes, of course.

940
00:56:53.006 --> 00:56:54.715
Don't hurry.

941
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:56.424
Take your time.

942
00:57:09.771 --> 00:57:11.106
That's very odd, I...

943
00:57:11.141 --> 00:57:12.441
I seem to make it...

944
00:57:12.476 --> 00:57:13.441
283?

945
00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:16.677
I
- I
-I can't understand it.

946
00:57:16.712 --> 00:57:18.313
But the total entered here is...

947
00:57:18.348 --> 00:57:19.313
273.

948
00:57:20.484 --> 00:57:23.118
In your handwriting, I believe.

949
00:57:23.153 --> 00:57:24.685
Correct me if I'm wrong.

950
00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:27.389
But there must be some mistake.
I've never made an error


951
00:57:27.424 --> 00:57:28.956
like this in all the years that
I have been with...


952
00:57:28.991 --> 00:57:32.194
Never mind, Gloatbridge, we're
all of us human after all.


953
00:57:32.229 --> 00:57:35.414
I'm not going to suggest that
should check the figures daily.


954
00:57:35.449 --> 00:57:38.359
I still have confidence in you.
I want you to understand that.


955
00:57:38.394 --> 00:57:41.700
But I think perhaps that I
should keep a firmer grip on the


956
00:57:41.735 --> 00:57:45.007
financial side of the business
in future. Would you agree?


957
00:57:45.042 --> 00:57:46.074
Oh, yes, of course, Mr. Henry.

958
00:57:46.608 --> 00:57:48.744
But I feel I ought to apologise
I don't quite know what to say.


959
00:57:48.779 --> 00:57:51.413
Don't worry, Gloatbridge.

960
00:57:51.448 --> 00:57:53.015
Cigarette?

961
00:57:53.548 --> 00:57:55.150
Oh, thank you, sir.

962
00:58:06.895 --> 00:58:09.031
Now, about this
projected merger,


963
00:58:09.564 --> 00:58:13.568
erm, don't mention it
to the rest of the staff.


964
00:58:13.603 --> 00:58:17.572
If it happens, it might
mean, erm... changes.


965
00:58:19.174 --> 00:58:22.377
I quite understand, Mr. Henry.

966
00:58:22.412 --> 00:58:25.598
Ah, yes. Now, I must phone ACI.

967
00:58:25.633 --> 00:58:28.784
Give me a line,
would you, please?


968
00:58:29.886 --> 00:58:31.453
Thank you.

969
00:58:41.063 --> 00:58:44.266
Hello, ACI? Boardroom, please.

970
00:58:44.301 --> 00:58:45.333
Hmm?

971
00:58:45.867 --> 00:58:47.434
Oh, it's you, Delauney.

972
00:58:47.469 --> 00:58:50.138
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Henry Palfrey here.


973
00:58:50.173 --> 00:58:52.808
Oh, that stupid girl
on the switchboard


974
00:58:53.341 --> 00:58:56.010
told me it was the ACI call.
No, no, just a moment.


975
00:58:56.045 --> 00:58:59.765
There was something I wanted
to talk to you about.


976
00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:03.485
Ah, yes, are you free for
a return match on Saturday?


977
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:06.688
Gloatbridge. Right,
thank you, thank you.


978
00:59:06.723 --> 00:59:07.688
Hmm?

979
00:59:10.994 --> 00:59:14.162
Yes, I suppose I am a
glutton for punishment.


980
00:59:14.197 --> 00:59:16.832
Yes, yes, do.
That's very kind of you.


981
00:59:16.867 --> 00:59:18.967
I've never ridden in a Bellini.

982
00:59:19.002 --> 00:59:21.103
No, don't worry.

983
00:59:21.636 --> 00:59:23.771
I'll be ready.

984
00:59:23.806 --> 00:59:25.907
Quarter to 3.

985
00:59:25.942 --> 00:59:26.975
Goodbye.

986
00:59:34.449 --> 00:59:37.119
What's up with the boss this
morning, Mr. Gloatbridge?


987
00:59:37.652 --> 00:59:39.219
Mr. Henry and I
have been discussing


988
00:59:39.254 --> 00:59:41.923
important policy matters
at a very high level.


989
00:59:41.958 --> 00:59:45.660
I am not at liberty
to say any more.


990
00:59:45.695 --> 00:59:48.829
Oh, Gloatbridge!
Mr. Henry.


991
00:59:48.864 --> 00:59:51.266
We'll go into that little matter
in greater detail tomorrow.


992
00:59:51.301 --> 00:59:53.668
Yes, of course, Mr. Henry,
certainly. Anything you wish...


993
00:59:53.703 --> 00:59:55.554
good morning, sir.

994
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:57.370
Miss. Stevens,

995
00:59:57.405 --> 01:00:00.074
fetch me all the ledgers
for the past five years.


996
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:02.744
Miss. Wilson, bring me up
the adding machine and...


997
01:00:02.779 --> 01:00:04.880
Appleby, get me a cup of tea.

998
01:00:40.116 --> 01:00:43.319
Hello! What're you
doing here?


999
01:00:43.354 --> 01:00:44.886
What am I doing here?

1000
01:00:44.921 --> 01:00:47.056
We said quarter to 3,
didn't we?


1001
01:00:47.091 --> 01:00:48.623
Quarter to...

1002
01:00:48.658 --> 01:00:51.826
oh, my dear fellow.
I'm so sorry.


1003
01:00:51.861 --> 01:00:54.263
I forgot all about it.
I'll be down in a flash.


1004
01:00:54.298 --> 01:00:56.666
Don't be long, we're picking
April up on the way.


1005
01:00:56.701 --> 01:00:59.085
April? April who?

1006
01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.435
Miss April Smith!

1007
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:03.606
All right, down in a minute.

1008
01:02:03.933 --> 01:02:05.001
Coming!

1009
01:02:22.084 --> 01:02:23.164
On guard!

1010
01:02:48.244 --> 01:02:50.913
So sorry, old man.
At last. Come on.


1011
01:02:50.948 --> 01:02:54.081
I say, what a beautiful day.

1012
01:02:54.116 --> 01:02:57.052
For pete's sake, hurry up.
We're late for April already.


1013
01:02:57.087 --> 01:02:59.989
Oh, don't worry, she won't be
ready. You know women. Ha ha!


1014
01:03:00.024 --> 01:03:01.022
Ooh!

1015
01:03:01.057 --> 01:03:02.623
I've forgotten something.
What?


1016
01:03:02.658 --> 01:03:05.328
Er, my shoes. I won't be a
moment, won't be a moment!


1017
01:03:19.209 --> 01:03:21.345
Here we are.
All present and correct.


1018
01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:22.911
Get in.

1019
01:03:22.946 --> 01:03:24.014
Oh, just a moment.
What is it now?


1020
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:26.114
My racquet.
Er, hang on. Um.


1021
01:03:26.149 --> 01:03:28.819
Did I leave it at the club or
is it upstairs under the bed?


1022
01:03:28.854 --> 01:03:29.851
Under the bed?!

1023
01:03:29.886 --> 01:03:31.488
I better go and look
just to make sure.


1024
01:03:31.523 --> 01:03:33.055
Look, get in,
you can borrow mine.


1025
01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:34.691
But what are you going to do?
I've got two.


1026
01:03:34.726 --> 01:03:36.293
But I can only play
with a 16-ounce,


1027
01:03:36.328 --> 01:03:37.326
and I know your old one is...

1028
01:03:37.361 --> 01:03:40.297
well, you can use my new one.
Get in!


1029
01:03:40.332 --> 01:03:43.233
Well, that's very decent of you
old boy.


1030
01:03:43.268 --> 01:03:44.835
Thank you very much.

1031
01:04:00.317 --> 01:04:04.054
I say, you did see
that light, didn't you?


1032
01:04:04.089 --> 01:04:05.655
I saw the light perfectly.

1033
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:14.731
You did say April Smith,
didn't you?


1034
01:04:14.766 --> 01:04:16.867
Yes, I did.
Has she moved?


1035
01:04:16.902 --> 01:04:17.899
Why?

1036
01:04:17.934 --> 01:04:19.536
Well, if she's still
in Oakshades Avenue,


1037
01:04:19.571 --> 01:04:21.103
you've taken the wrong turning.

1038
01:04:21.138 --> 01:04:22.739
The quickest way was to take
the last turning on left,


1039
01:04:22.774 --> 01:04:24.875
then first right
over the railway bridge.


1040
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:26.227
Are you sure?
Yes, honestly.


1041
01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:27.509
It takes minutes off it.

1042
01:04:27.544 --> 01:04:30.712
I should turn around
if I were you. Here.


1043
01:04:30.747 --> 01:04:34.484
No, wait a moment. Better still,
go left then left again.


1044
01:04:34.519 --> 01:04:36.086
There?

1045
01:04:40.357 --> 01:04:42.492
Wait a moment.
Hang on.


1046
01:04:48.365 --> 01:04:50.465
The second...

1047
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.703
no, no, no, no,
the third on the right, here.


1048
01:04:56.907 --> 01:04:58.508
That's it.

1049
01:05:02.245 --> 01:05:03.205
I think.

1050
01:05:05.449 --> 01:05:06.783
Turn right.

1051
01:05:06.818 --> 01:05:08.118
Mind that tree!

1052
01:05:11.855 --> 01:05:13.723
A tree in the middle
of the road.


1053
01:05:13.758 --> 01:05:15.592
Are you sure you know the way?

1054
01:05:15.627 --> 01:05:16.660
Positive.

1055
01:05:21.465 --> 01:05:25.735
Turn right, then bear left
at the waterworks.


1056
01:05:27.871 --> 01:05:30.006
That's it, yeah.

1057
01:05:38.014 --> 01:05:40.684
I say, I'm terribly sorry.
I...


1058
01:05:40.719 --> 01:05:42.250
sorry?

1059
01:05:42.285 --> 01:05:44.421
Trouble is I'm only used to
this shortcut after dark.


1060
01:05:44.955 --> 01:05:45.987
After dark!?

1061
01:05:46.022 --> 01:05:48.158
By the way, did I say
turn left at the waterworks?


1062
01:05:48.193 --> 01:05:49.759
Yes, you did.
Oh, I'm a fool


1063
01:05:50.293 --> 01:05:51.361
I meant right.

1064
01:05:51.895 --> 01:05:54.030
Why couldn't you keep your ruddy
mouth shut and let me go my way?


1065
01:05:54.065 --> 01:05:56.166
But this way is a lot
quicker, old chap.


1066
01:05:57.767 --> 01:06:00.436
Oh, I say, bad luck.

1067
01:06:00.471 --> 01:06:03.106
New paintwork too.

1068
01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:31.367
She didn't wait.

1069
01:06:31.402 --> 01:06:32.470
Women. They're all
the same.


1070
01:06:33.004 --> 01:06:34.570
All that rush for nothing.

1071
01:06:34.605 --> 01:06:36.741
I must say I'm looking forward
to trying that new racquet.


1072
01:06:42.079 --> 01:06:44.215
What on earth was that?

1073
01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:50.087
Can I help, old man?

1074
01:06:50.122 --> 01:06:51.155
It's the exhaust.

1075
01:06:51.689 --> 01:06:53.256
Oh, bad luck.

1076
01:06:53.291 --> 01:06:54.358
You know, it must've happened

1077
01:06:54.892 --> 01:06:57.028
when you bashed into
that brick wall.


1078
01:07:00.765 --> 01:07:02.900
Have you got a piece of string?

1079
01:07:10.374 --> 01:07:12.509
Well, we made it.

1080
01:07:12.544 --> 01:07:14.645
No thanks to you.

1081
01:07:17.848 --> 01:07:18.916
Whose is that car?
I haven't seen it here before.


1082
01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:21.052
Er, oh, it's mine actually.

1083
01:07:21.087 --> 01:07:22.618
Yours?
Yeah.


1084
01:07:22.653 --> 01:07:23.686
What's it doing here?

1085
01:07:23.721 --> 01:07:25.322
Er, oh, I had the racing heads
taken off.


1086
01:07:25.357 --> 01:07:26.924
I knew you were
picking me up anyway,


1087
01:07:27.458 --> 01:07:29.594
so I asked the garage
to deliver it here.


1088
01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:31.195
Shall we go?

1089
01:07:52.016 --> 01:07:55.184
Ah! We've got court 2,
I see.


1090
01:07:55.219 --> 01:07:57.355
All right, I'll get some balls
you get the racquets.


1091
01:07:57.390 --> 01:07:59.241
Aren't you going to change?

1092
01:07:59.276 --> 01:08:01.057
Mmm? Oh,
only my shoes.


1093
01:08:01.092 --> 01:08:03.227
I always think it's a bit
pompous to dress up in whites


1094
01:08:03.262 --> 01:08:05.363
for a friendly game, don't you?

1095
01:08:06.964 --> 01:08:09.065
Oh, I say.

1096
01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:11.769
You're putting it on a bit,
old man, aren't you?


1097
01:08:12.303 --> 01:08:13.336
Oh, Mr. Delauney.

1098
01:08:13.371 --> 01:08:15.506
I was just going to give
your court to the General.


1099
01:08:15.541 --> 01:08:17.642
It's 3:30, you know.
Sorry, Carpenter.


1100
01:08:17.677 --> 01:08:20.810
3:30, sir, see that?
Sorry, sir.


1101
01:08:20.845 --> 01:08:22.446
But Palfrey wasn't quite ready
when I made the call for him.


1102
01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:25.081
Don't try to put the blame
on someone else, sir.


1103
01:08:25.116 --> 01:08:27.785
The court was booked in your
name and you're 30 minutes late.


1104
01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:32.056
That's all I want to know.
Carpenter, Complaints Book.


1105
01:08:55.012 --> 01:08:58.749
Thank you very much.

1106
01:08:58.784 --> 01:09:00.316
Right, call.

1107
01:09:00.351 --> 01:09:01.952
Rough.
Rough it is.


1108
01:09:01.987 --> 01:09:03.519
Oh! Lucky!

1109
01:09:03.554 --> 01:09:06.188
Side or service?
Oh, I'll serve.


1110
01:09:06.223 --> 01:09:08.625
All right, well,
I'll take this side.


1111
01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:10.379
You'll have the sun
in your eyes.


1112
01:09:10.414 --> 01:09:12.097
Well, we're changing,
aren't we?


1113
01:09:12.132 --> 01:09:13.165
Huh.

1114
01:09:13.699 --> 01:09:14.766
I say!
Hmm?


1115
01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:16.368
Shut the gate, old man,
would you?


1116
01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:17.969
Shut...?

1117
01:09:24.376 --> 01:09:26.476
Is the net all right?
Mm?


1118
01:09:26.511 --> 01:09:29.181
Er, would you like it
a little lower?


1119
01:09:36.655 --> 01:09:37.723
I'm ready.

1120
01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:43.061
I say!

1121
01:09:49.468 --> 01:09:52.137
I've just seen the General over
there talking to the Secretary.


1122
01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:55.340
Do you think I ought to tell him
it was my fault we were late?


1123
01:09:55.874 --> 01:09:56.942
No!

1124
01:09:57.476 --> 01:09:58.543
Right.

1125
01:10:08.687 --> 01:10:09.755
No!

1126
01:10:12.424 --> 01:10:14.559
Bad luck. Love-15.

1127
01:10:18.296 --> 01:10:20.432
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1128
01:10:23.635 --> 01:10:26.304
Oh, bad luck! Love-30.

1129
01:10:30.575 --> 01:10:32.676
Have it again.
It was out!


1130
01:10:32.711 --> 01:10:34.846
Well, I honestly couldn't see.
The sun was in my eyes.


1131
01:10:34.881 --> 01:10:36.448
Could quite easily have been in.

1132
01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:39.651
Have two more.
It was out!


1133
01:10:40.185 --> 01:10:41.253
All right.

1134
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.740
Oh!

1135
01:10:50.328 --> 01:10:51.895
Oh, bad luck!

1136
01:10:51.930 --> 01:10:53.532
Awfully good serve, though.

1137
01:10:53.567 --> 01:10:55.667
Love-40.

1138
01:11:03.675 --> 01:11:05.276
Hard cheese!

1139
01:11:05.311 --> 01:11:06.878
One-love.

1140
01:11:10.615 --> 01:11:13.285
I say, this is
a wonderful racquet.


1141
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.886
Your service.

1142
01:11:25.564 --> 01:11:26.284
Fault!

1143
01:11:31.436 --> 01:11:33.572
Sorry.
But yours was in.


1144
01:11:33.939 --> 01:11:35.138
Was it?

1145
01:11:35.173 --> 01:11:36.740
I thought it was a fault.

1146
01:11:36.775 --> 01:11:39.409
It was well in.
Well, I couldn't see.


1147
01:11:39.444 --> 01:11:41.580
I'd have thought you'd have
shouted if it was in.


1148
01:11:41.615 --> 01:11:44.214
Oh, have it again.
Oh, no, no, no.


1149
01:11:44.249 --> 01:11:46.918
I couldn't have got your return
anyway. Love-15.


1150
01:11:46.953 --> 01:11:49.588
Have it again.
No, no, no, honestly.


1151
01:11:50.121 --> 01:11:52.791
I insist that you have it again!

1152
01:11:53.325 --> 01:11:54.926
Oh, all right.

1153
01:12:00.799 --> 01:12:02.899
Oh, bad luck!

1154
01:12:02.934 --> 01:12:05.070
I feel really bad about
that one.


1155
01:12:05.604 --> 01:12:06.671
15-love.

1156
01:13:15.541 --> 01:13:18.210
I say, old chap, I feel I've got
rather an unfair advantage.


1157
01:13:18.245 --> 01:13:19.777
I do wish you'd swap racquets.

1158
01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:21.414
I'm perfectly happy
with the one I've got.


1159
01:13:21.948 --> 01:13:22.980
No, no, no, I insist.

1160
01:13:23.015 --> 01:13:24.582
After all, this one is yours.

1161
01:13:24.617 --> 01:13:27.286
Let me have a shot with
that old one. Ha ha ha.


1162
01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:40.633
Gently, now.

1163
01:13:42.234 --> 01:13:45.438
Don't know your own strength
with that racquet.


1164
01:13:45.473 --> 01:13:47.039
15-love.

1165
01:13:52.912 --> 01:13:54.513
Hello, April!

1166
01:13:54.548 --> 01:13:56.115
30-love.

1167
01:13:58.784 --> 01:14:01.987
April, I can explain everything.
We lost our way and...


1168
01:14:02.022 --> 01:14:05.191
there's nothing to explain.
You were late and that's that.


1169
01:14:05.226 --> 01:14:07.326
Oh, do get on with your game.

1170
01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.462
Lovely day, Henry!

1171
01:14:09.497 --> 01:14:11.063
Beautiful!

1172
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:13.733
But, April...

1173
01:14:25.478 --> 01:14:27.613
Good shot, Henry!

1174
01:14:27.648 --> 01:14:28.681
40-love.

1175
01:14:31.350 --> 01:14:33.985
April, you must listen to me.

1176
01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:37.223
I called for Palfrey...
young man! You, sir!


1177
01:14:37.258 --> 01:14:39.358
Are you or are you
not using this court


1178
01:14:39.393 --> 01:14:41.459
for the purpose of
playing tennis?


1179
01:14:41.494 --> 01:14:44.697
I booked this court for 4
o'clock, it's one minute to.


1180
01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:47.366
40-love.
Oh, nuts!


1181
01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:51.103
And we don't tolerate filthy
language in this club, sir.


1182
01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:52.705
Match point!

1183
01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:57.510
Ha ha ha!
Well played, sir!


1184
01:14:57.545 --> 01:14:59.111
Well played!

1185
01:15:00.713 --> 01:15:02.314
Well, shake hands, sir.

1186
01:15:02.349 --> 01:15:03.064
Shake?

1187
01:15:05.518 --> 01:15:07.618
Not me, you fool!

1188
01:15:07.653 --> 01:15:11.925
One thing I can't tolerate,
a bad loser, unsportsmanlike.


1189
01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:13.527
Well played, young man.
Thank you, general.


1190
01:15:13.562 --> 01:15:15.662
Best man won.
Thank you, sir.


1191
01:15:24.204 --> 01:15:25.806
April, April, let's get
this straight, I...


1192
01:15:26.339 --> 01:15:27.941
you're playing much better
today, Henry.


1193
01:15:27.976 --> 01:15:29.508
What was the score?
Oh, just one set to me.


1194
01:15:29.543 --> 01:15:32.212
Didn't have time for any more.
I mean the score in games.


1195
01:15:32.247 --> 01:15:33.245
Oh, it's not important really.

1196
01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.415
After all, it was only
a friendly game.


1197
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:38.050
It was 6-love.
Now, April...


1198
01:15:38.085 --> 01:15:39.686
Well, thank you, Raymond.
I enjoyed that.


1199
01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.320
And many thanks for
the loan of your racquet.


1200
01:15:42.355 --> 01:15:45.559
You mean to say you beat him
playing with a borrowed racquet?


1201
01:15:45.594 --> 01:15:47.125
Oh...
no!


1202
01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.261
I mean yes.
Well, not exactly.


1203
01:15:49.296 --> 01:15:50.363
But April, I can
explain the whole thing.


1204
01:15:50.897 --> 01:15:54.634
Raymond, I've already told you
there is nothing to explain.


1205
01:15:54.669 --> 01:15:56.201
But there is, damn it!

1206
01:15:56.236 --> 01:15:58.905
Language, old man, language.
Ha ha.


1207
01:15:59.439 --> 01:16:01.041
Oh, just forgotten the balls.

1208
01:16:01.575 --> 01:16:02.642
Erm... look, go on, will you?

1209
01:16:03.176 --> 01:16:05.312
Join you in a couple
of seconds. Ha ha.


1210
01:16:11.718 --> 01:16:13.854
How well do you know Palfrey,
anyhow?


1211
01:16:13.889 --> 01:16:14.921
I beg your pardon.

1212
01:16:15.455 --> 01:16:16.523
Well, why is it he only knows

1213
01:16:17.057 --> 01:16:19.157
the short cut
to your house in the dark?


1214
01:16:19.192 --> 01:16:21.328
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.


1215
01:16:26.133 --> 01:16:28.268
Congratulations, my boy.
You rather excelled yourself.


1216
01:16:28.303 --> 01:16:29.870
In fact you have passed
with honours.


1217
01:16:29.905 --> 01:16:30.902
Thank you, sir.

1218
01:16:30.937 --> 01:16:32.504
It was that changing of
the racquets that did it


1219
01:16:32.539 --> 01:16:34.941
just as he was getting used
to the feel of the old one.


1220
01:16:34.976 --> 01:16:37.344
Well, I take it you're eager
to get after the young girl?


1221
01:16:37.878 --> 01:16:39.444
That's right, sir.
Well, what I am about to do


1222
01:16:39.479 --> 01:16:42.682
is usually done in more formal
circumstances, you understand.


1223
01:16:42.717 --> 01:16:44.284
But, fortunately,
provisions have been made


1224
01:16:44.319 --> 01:16:46.170
for it to be done in the field

1225
01:16:46.205 --> 01:16:48.021
where emergency so dictates.

1226
01:16:48.555 --> 01:16:51.224
So, just stand where
you are, Palfrey.


1227
01:16:51.259 --> 01:16:53.894
Take you hands
out of your pockets.


1228
01:16:53.929 --> 01:16:55.460
Now then, Henry Palfrey.

1229
01:16:55.495 --> 01:16:58.698
By virtue of the power vested
in me as founder and principal


1230
01:16:58.733 --> 01:17:00.300
of the College of
Lifemanship at Yeovil,


1231
01:17:00.834 --> 01:17:01.867
it gives me great pleasure

1232
01:17:01.902 --> 01:17:05.105
to award you this
Certificate of Lifemanship.


1233
01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.173
Now, bend your head.
Umm?


1234
01:17:06.706 --> 01:17:08.273
Bend your head, Palfrey.

1235
01:17:08.308 --> 01:17:11.511
There, that's all,
my boy. Congratulations.


1236
01:17:11.546 --> 01:17:13.397
Thank you
very much indeed, sir.


1237
01:17:13.432 --> 01:17:15.213
Nonsense, my boy.
You deserve it.


1238
01:17:15.248 --> 01:17:17.383
As a matter of fact, I've never
said this to a student before,


1239
01:17:17.418 --> 01:17:19.519
but I was wondering if you'd
consider giving up this girl,


1240
01:17:19.554 --> 01:17:22.206
and instead joining me
at Yeovil.


1241
01:17:22.241 --> 01:17:24.823
Oh, that's terribly
flattering, sir,


1242
01:17:24.858 --> 01:17:27.527
and don't think I don't
appreciate it but...


1243
01:17:27.562 --> 01:17:30.481
I'm afraid not, sir.
No, I didn't think so.


1244
01:17:30.516 --> 01:17:33.400
Well, up and at her, Palfrey.
Yes, sir.


1245
01:17:33.435 --> 01:17:34.966
One last piece of advice,
Palfrey.


1246
01:17:35.001 --> 01:17:36.603
I take it it's your intention
to go out there


1247
01:17:36.638 --> 01:17:38.738
and lock horns
with this other fellow


1248
01:17:38.773 --> 01:17:40.090
about driving the girl home.

1249
01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:41.408
Well, I was going to go...

1250
01:17:44.077 --> 01:17:46.711
umm. Once you've got
your opponent on the ropes,


1251
01:17:46.746 --> 01:17:49.416
surely you're in the perfect
position for calling into play


1252
01:17:49.451 --> 01:17:52.584
the calculated
indifference ploy.


1253
01:17:52.619 --> 01:17:54.754
Best summed up by a paraphrase
of the old nursery rhyme,


1254
01:17:54.789 --> 01:17:56.356
"leave her alone
and she'll come home,


1255
01:17:56.890 --> 01:17:58.456
"wagging her tail
behind her."


1256
01:17:58.491 --> 01:18:00.627
You really think the neglected
gambit is the one to use?


1257
01:18:00.662 --> 01:18:02.229
Old, tried and true.

1258
01:18:02.762 --> 01:18:04.898
I've just had a thought, sir.
What if she doesn't like me?


1259
01:18:05.432 --> 01:18:06.499
Well, that's a detail.

1260
01:18:07.033 --> 01:18:08.600
Some of the most
successful marriages


1261
01:18:08.635 --> 01:18:11.305
are made up of people who
scarcely talk to each other.


1262
01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:13.975
Well, good luck, Palfrey.
Thank you very much, sir.


1263
01:18:14.010 --> 01:18:17.195
Three guineas, please.
Three guineas?


1264
01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:20.381
Well, we use
only the best parchment.


1265
01:18:20.416 --> 01:18:21.983
Oh, yes.

1266
01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:27.321
Really, my dear,
it isn't necessary for you


1267
01:18:27.356 --> 01:18:28.354
to try to make me jealous.

1268
01:18:28.389 --> 01:18:29.991
I'm quite your devoted slave
as it is.


1269
01:18:30.026 --> 01:18:31.023
Raymond, I've already told you.

1270
01:18:31.058 --> 01:18:33.193
I was not trying
to make you jealous.


1271
01:18:33.228 --> 01:18:35.329
You're a dear little
storyteller.


1272
01:18:35.364 --> 01:18:38.497
I absolutely adore you.

1273
01:18:38.532 --> 01:18:39.600
What have you done to your car?

1274
01:18:40.134 --> 01:18:42.269
I had a bit of
an accident, actually.


1275
01:18:42.304 --> 01:18:44.405
Were you hurt?
No, it shook me up a bit.


1276
01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.074
It put me off my game,
I'm afraid.


1277
01:18:47.109 --> 01:18:49.210
Raymond, I'm so sorry.
I...


1278
01:18:49.245 --> 01:18:51.844
ah, there you are.

1279
01:18:51.879 --> 01:18:54.015
I've asked Carpenter to
phone the garage, Raymond.


1280
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:55.047
I said you'd had an accident.

1281
01:18:55.082 --> 01:18:57.218
I thought it sounded better.
Better than what?


1282
01:18:57.253 --> 01:18:59.318
Well, it's a bit
embarrassing to admit


1283
01:18:59.353 --> 01:19:02.023
you backed into a wall in broad
daylight, isn't it? Cheers.


1284
01:19:03.624 --> 01:19:05.226
Aren't you coming with us?

1285
01:19:05.261 --> 01:19:06.792
Oh, ho, ho, no.

1286
01:19:06.827 --> 01:19:08.963
Two's company, you know.

1287
01:19:15.903 --> 01:19:18.038
Dear sweet girl, do you
realise how close you came


1288
01:19:18.073 --> 01:19:20.174
to suffering the consequences
of your little game?


1289
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.924
Mm?

1290
01:19:21.811 --> 01:19:23.377
He might have accepted and we
should have been stuck with him.


1291
01:19:23.412 --> 01:19:24.979
What are you...? Now,
don't worry, little kitten


1292
01:19:25.014 --> 01:19:26.047
I would've saved you
and got rid of him.


1293
01:19:26.082 --> 01:19:27.613
Saved me?

1294
01:19:27.648 --> 01:19:30.318
And let that be a lesson
to you, my sweet.


1295
01:19:30.353 --> 01:19:32.987
You mean...?
Now, just a minute.


1296
01:19:33.022 --> 01:19:34.553
In the first place,

1297
01:19:34.588 --> 01:19:36.155
I am not your sweet.
Oh!


1298
01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:38.326
In the second place,
despite what you might think,


1299
01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:39.892
I genuinely meant
that invitation


1300
01:19:39.927 --> 01:19:41.529
and I'd have been delighted
had he accepted.


1301
01:19:42.063 --> 01:19:45.266
In the third place,
I have never met such a smug,


1302
01:19:45.301 --> 01:19:47.366
self-centred,
conceited...


1303
01:19:47.401 --> 01:19:50.071
and in the fourth place,
good-bye.


1304
01:20:29.577 --> 01:20:32.780
Oh, Mr. Delauney, the garage
people will be here shortly.


1305
01:20:32.815 --> 01:20:34.382
Who is that man?
He's not a member, is he?


1306
01:20:34.915 --> 01:20:38.119
Oh, no, sir. He came in today
as a guest of Mr. Palfrey's.


1307
01:20:38.154 --> 01:20:39.369
What?

1308
01:20:41.357 --> 01:20:43.457
Are you sure?
Oh, yes, sir.


1309
01:20:43.492 --> 01:20:44.525
As a matter of fact,

1310
01:20:45.059 --> 01:20:46.660
I saw them behaving
in the most peculiar manner


1311
01:20:46.695 --> 01:20:48.796
on the croquet lawn
just now, sir.


1312
01:20:48.831 --> 01:20:50.682
Really?

1313
01:20:50.717 --> 01:20:52.533
Thanks.

1314
01:21:17.092 --> 01:21:18.960
Where to?

1315
01:21:18.995 --> 01:21:20.829
Anywhere.

1316
01:22:13.148 --> 01:22:15.283
I should think you could use
a drink, couldn't you?


1317
01:22:15.318 --> 01:22:17.970
Yes, I could.
Thank you.


1318
01:22:18.005 --> 01:22:20.622
Oh, that smug, conceited...

1319
01:22:20.657 --> 01:22:22.757
boor?
Yes, boor.


1320
01:22:49.985 --> 01:22:51.586
Follow that bus!

1321
01:22:59.095 --> 01:23:02.264
I should change before we go out
for that drink, shouldn't I?


1322
01:23:02.299 --> 01:23:04.399
Do you mind if we stop off
at my place for a moment?


1323
01:23:04.434 --> 01:23:05.467
Of course not.

1324
01:23:15.610 --> 01:23:17.212
There we are!

1325
01:23:17.746 --> 01:23:20.914
Look, this may sound
a bit Victorian, but...


1326
01:23:20.949 --> 01:23:23.618
if you'd prefer to stay here,
I'd quite understand.


1327
01:23:23.653 --> 01:23:25.185
You are sweet, Henry.

1328
01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:27.889
Look, why don't we have
that drink in your flat?


1329
01:23:27.924 --> 01:23:30.025
Fine!

1330
01:23:41.236 --> 01:23:44.172
There we are.

1331
01:23:44.207 --> 01:23:47.073
Oh, Henry!

1332
01:23:47.108 --> 01:23:49.777
How nice and cosy.
Thank you.


1333
01:23:49.812 --> 01:23:52.447
Erm, sit down?
Thank you.


1334
01:23:52.482 --> 01:23:54.014
Now, then.

1335
01:23:54.049 --> 01:23:56.184
What's it to be?
Whiskey?


1336
01:23:56.219 --> 01:23:57.786
Fine.
Good.


1337
01:24:06.861 --> 01:24:09.531
Soda?
Please.


1338
01:24:29.819 --> 01:24:32.453
Cheers!
Thank you. Oops! Ooh!


1339
01:24:32.488 --> 01:24:34.055
Oh, I am sorry.
Oh, look at the sofa.


1340
01:24:34.090 --> 01:24:35.157
Never mind my sofa,
what about your dress?


1341
01:24:35.192 --> 01:24:36.724
It's terrible.
I'm awfully clumsy


1342
01:24:36.759 --> 01:24:38.894
you can't very well
sit around like that, can you?


1343
01:24:38.929 --> 01:24:41.564
Erm... I know.
Just a minute.


1344
01:25:03.986 --> 01:25:06.087
There. Now, why don't you
pop into that


1345
01:25:06.122 --> 01:25:09.325
and I'll dry your dress
in front of the fire?


1346
01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.891
Oh, I really don't think
I ought...


1347
01:25:10.926 --> 01:25:15.197
then, you can tell your
uncle Henry all about it.


1348
01:25:15.232 --> 01:25:17.832
Uncle Henry?

1349
01:25:17.867 --> 01:25:19.967
Yes, well, I suppose
I better had.


1350
01:25:20.002 --> 01:25:22.672
Good. Give me a shout
when you're ready.


1351
01:25:24.273 --> 01:25:26.942
You are kind
and thoughtful, Henry.


1352
01:25:36.552 --> 01:25:38.653
Mrs. Stringer?

1353
01:25:38.688 --> 01:25:40.289
Henry Palfrey here.

1354
01:25:40.823 --> 01:25:45.628
When you have a free moment,
could you pop up here, please?


1355
01:25:45.663 --> 01:25:47.229
Thank you,
Mrs. Stringer.


1356
01:25:55.771 --> 01:25:57.907
You can come in now!

1357
01:26:00.042 --> 01:26:02.178
Splendid!

1358
01:26:02.712 --> 01:26:04.278
Now, then.

1359
01:26:04.313 --> 01:26:10.186
We'll just pop these things on
the chair in front of the fire.


1360
01:26:10.221 --> 01:26:16.058
They should be dry
in no time at all. That's it.


1361
01:26:16.093 --> 01:26:18.478
How do you feel?
Fine, thanks, uncle Henry.


1362
01:26:18.513 --> 01:26:20.863
Good. Let's get you
another drink, shall we?


1363
01:26:35.811 --> 01:26:38.481
First to Yeovil, please.

1364
01:26:38.516 --> 01:26:39.231
Ah!

1365
01:26:45.955 --> 01:26:48.624
There we are!

1366
01:26:48.659 --> 01:26:51.293
Now, then.

1367
01:26:51.827 --> 01:26:53.962
How do you feel?
Much more comfortable.


1368
01:26:53.997 --> 01:26:56.098
This was a very good idea,
uncle Henry.


1369
01:26:56.133 --> 01:26:58.234
Cheers.
Cheers.


1370
01:27:03.038 --> 01:27:03.788
Ah!

1371
01:27:05.209 --> 01:27:07.309
Oh, that's much better.

1372
01:27:12.115 --> 01:27:14.251
Mm?
Henry, your socks.


1373
01:27:14.286 --> 01:27:15.852
So... oh!

1374
01:27:19.055 --> 01:27:20.657
Oh, dear!

1375
01:27:21.191 --> 01:27:25.462
Oh, oh, actually, I usually
manage pretty well, but...


1376
01:27:25.996 --> 01:27:27.597
Look, I must come in
one day and mend it.


1377
01:27:29.768 --> 01:27:32.901
Who's that hmm?

1378
01:27:32.936 --> 01:27:35.036
Oh, I haven't
the faintest idea.


1379
01:27:35.071 --> 01:27:38.809
Ah, I say, this is a bit awkward
now I come to think of it.


1380
01:27:38.844 --> 01:27:40.375
Yes.

1381
01:27:40.410 --> 01:27:42.546
You being here alone
in a man's flat,


1382
01:27:42.581 --> 01:27:44.147
wearing his dressing gown,

1383
01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:45.714
guzzling whiskey.

1384
01:27:45.749 --> 01:27:48.952
Yes, it is.
You've got your shoes off too.


1385
01:27:50.589 --> 01:27:52.689
Better hide. Um...

1386
01:27:52.724 --> 01:27:53.720
quickly.

1387
01:27:53.755 --> 01:27:54.717
In here.

1388
01:27:56.461 --> 01:27:58.028
Won't be a moment.

1389
01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:10.272
Ah, Mrs. Stringer.

1390
01:28:10.307 --> 01:28:12.976
I come up as quick as I could,
Mr. Palfrey. What is it?


1391
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:14.578
Well, I'm afraid it was
a mistake, Mrs. Stringer.


1392
01:28:15.111 --> 01:28:16.678
Mistake?

1393
01:28:16.713 --> 01:28:19.382
But only just now you telephoned
down and asked me to come up.


1394
01:28:19.417 --> 01:28:21.518
Yes, well, I thought
I was going to need you


1395
01:28:21.553 --> 01:28:23.618
but I've been able to
manage myself.


1396
01:28:23.653 --> 01:28:26.857
Telephoning down and then
changing your mind.


1397
01:28:26.892 --> 01:28:28.458
I suppose you think
that's fun for me,


1398
01:28:28.992 --> 01:28:30.559
to run up five flight
of stairs.


1399
01:28:30.594 --> 01:28:33.797
You know I wouldn't dare opera
the lift in my state of nerves.


1400
01:28:33.832 --> 01:28:34.865
I'm very sorry,
Mrs. Stringer.


1401
01:28:35.398 --> 01:28:37.000
Yes, and I'm sorry too

1402
01:28:37.035 --> 01:28:38.567
there... ah!

1403
01:28:38.602 --> 01:28:40.203
Come on, Queenie.

1404
01:28:48.478 --> 01:28:49.279
Just the porter's wife

1405
01:28:49.813 --> 01:28:51.414
I managed to get rid of her
as quickly as I could.


1406
01:28:51.449 --> 01:28:52.482
Good.

1407
01:28:57.821 --> 01:28:59.387
What is it?

1408
01:28:59.422 --> 01:29:03.159
It's amazing how sexless a woman
looks in a man's dressing gown.


1409
01:29:03.693 --> 01:29:05.260
Sexless?

1410
01:29:05.295 --> 01:29:08.498
Umm, well...
shapeless.


1411
01:29:08.533 --> 01:29:09.531
Shapeless?

1412
01:29:09.566 --> 01:29:12.235
Mmm.
A little girlish.


1413
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:14.870
I don't know what it is,

1414
01:29:14.905 --> 01:29:18.108
it makes a man feel protective.

1415
01:29:20.777 --> 01:29:23.713
Just protective?

1416
01:29:23.748 --> 01:29:26.615
Well, paternal.

1417
01:29:26.650 --> 01:29:28.785
Paternal?
Well, no.


1418
01:29:29.319 --> 01:29:31.988
Perhaps more like a friend.

1419
01:29:32.023 --> 01:29:34.658
How good a friend?

1420
01:29:35.191 --> 01:29:36.259
Oh, a good friend.

1421
01:29:38.929 --> 01:29:42.666
A very good friend.

1422
01:29:42.701 --> 01:29:44.766
A very...

1423
01:29:44.801 --> 01:29:46.937
very good friend indeed.

1424
01:29:56.012 --> 01:29:58.148
No.
What is it?


1425
01:29:58.682 --> 01:30:00.283
Put your dress on.
I'll take you home.


1426
01:30:00.817 --> 01:30:02.384
But why?

1427
01:30:02.419 --> 01:30:04.554
What happened?
Get dressed, please.


1428
01:30:06.191 --> 01:30:07.722
Open up!

1429
01:30:07.757 --> 01:30:08.825
I know you're in there.
Let me in.


1430
01:30:09.359 --> 01:30:10.961
Let me in, you cad,
or I'll call the police.


1431
01:30:10.996 --> 01:30:13.062
Open this door, you cad!

1432
01:30:13.097 --> 01:30:15.197
I'll have to let him I
n. You go in there.


1433
01:30:15.232 --> 01:30:16.834
I'll get rid of him as quickly
as I can and I'll take you home.


1434
01:30:17.368 --> 01:30:18.436
Now, come on.
Open the door!


1435
01:30:18.471 --> 01:30:20.536
Open up, I say.

1436
01:30:20.571 --> 01:30:23.240
Come on, you bounder. I know
you're in there, you stinker.


1437
01:30:23.275 --> 01:30:25.660
Where is she? Come on. I know
she is here. Where is she?


1438
01:30:25.695 --> 01:30:28.045
Will you keep your voice down?
The neighbours will hear you.


1439
01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.181
So they should, you spoiler.
Come on. Where is she?


1440
01:30:30.216 --> 01:30:32.281
She is not here.

1441
01:30:32.316 --> 01:30:35.786
Oh? These, I suppose,
are yours.


1442
01:30:35.821 --> 01:30:39.256
April smith,
you can come out now.


1443
01:30:39.291 --> 01:30:40.858
This is Raymond.

1444
01:30:44.595 --> 01:30:47.798
If this means I'm too late,
you rotter...


1445
01:30:47.833 --> 01:30:49.400
Am I, kitten?

1446
01:30:49.435 --> 01:30:50.150
No.

1447
01:30:52.638 --> 01:30:55.023
You're not too late.

1448
01:30:55.058 --> 01:30:57.373
Oh, thank goodness.

1449
01:30:57.408 --> 01:30:59.010
Well, now do you see where
your little jealousies lead?


1450
01:30:59.543 --> 01:31:01.679
If it hadn't been for my
quick thinking, this man...


1451
01:31:01.714 --> 01:31:03.245
this man? This rat.

1452
01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:05.416
Let me tell you something about
your fine-feathered friend.


1453
01:31:05.451 --> 01:31:08.085
Do you know what he did?
He went to Yeovil,


1454
01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.687
he went to the
college of Lifemanship


1455
01:31:09.722 --> 01:31:11.840
and he learnt all the tricks.

1456
01:31:11.875 --> 01:31:13.923
All his dirty rotten tricks.

1457
01:31:13.958 --> 01:31:16.592
No, no, no, not tricks,
my good man.


1458
01:31:16.627 --> 01:31:19.296
Arts, science, philosophy
if you like, but...


1459
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:21.397
no, no, no, not tricks.

1460
01:31:21.432 --> 01:31:23.034
Well, you can call them
what you like.


1461
01:31:23.567 --> 01:31:26.237
But all they are
are dastardly, low down devices


1462
01:31:26.272 --> 01:31:27.838
designed to pull
the wool over the eyes


1463
01:31:27.873 --> 01:31:29.440
of innocent young things.

1464
01:31:29.475 --> 01:31:31.042
Look!

1465
01:31:31.575 --> 01:31:33.142
"Potter's Woo-manship.

1466
01:31:33.177 --> 01:31:35.312
"Woo-manship... the art
of being one up on women


1467
01:31:35.347 --> 01:31:36.879
"without actually
marrying them.


1468
01:31:36.914 --> 01:31:39.850
"The uncle ploy
for trust and confidence,


1469
01:31:39.885 --> 01:31:42.787
"from living room to bedroom
in 3 easy moves.


1470
01:31:42.822 --> 01:31:45.456
"After the bedroom, what?"

1471
01:31:45.491 --> 01:31:47.556
What indeed?

1472
01:31:47.591 --> 01:31:50.795
Henry, is it true?

1473
01:31:56.133 --> 01:31:58.535
What on earth is
the matter with you, man?


1474
01:31:58.570 --> 01:32:00.938
Ploy 64...
throw yourself on her mercy.


1475
01:32:00.973 --> 01:32:02.540
No, Mr. Potter.

1476
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:07.344
It's true, April.

1477
01:32:07.878 --> 01:32:10.014
They were tricks.
All tricks.


1478
01:32:10.049 --> 01:32:11.082
Ploys, boy, ploys.

1479
01:32:11.615 --> 01:32:14.285
Tricks, ploys,
what difference does it make?


1480
01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:17.453
That's why I...

1481
01:32:17.488 --> 01:32:19.890
that's why you stopped,

1482
01:32:19.925 --> 01:32:22.258
isn't it?
That's right.


1483
01:32:22.293 --> 01:32:23.894
Come, April. Let me take you
away from all this.


1484
01:32:24.428 --> 01:32:27.631
I love you, April.

1485
01:32:27.666 --> 01:32:30.301
Oh, Henry.

1486
01:32:30.835 --> 01:32:32.970
I love you too.

1487
01:32:35.106 --> 01:32:38.274
Shhh. We're witnessing
the birth of a new ploy.


1488
01:32:38.309 --> 01:32:42.046
No, Mr. Potter. I love April
and I want April to love me.


1489
01:32:42.081 --> 01:32:44.181
I do. I do.

1490
01:32:44.216 --> 01:32:45.748
No...

1491
01:32:45.783 --> 01:32:48.951
not, not sincerity, Palfrey.

1492
01:32:48.986 --> 01:32:50.588
Just a minute.
Something's gone wrong.


1493
01:32:50.623 --> 01:32:53.756
Stop that I say!

1494
01:32:53.791 --> 01:32:56.460
You can't do this to me.

1495
01:32:56.495 --> 01:32:58.561
Kissing.

1496
01:32:58.596 --> 01:33:01.265
Well, don't just stand there,
Mr. Potter, do something.


1497
01:33:03.934 --> 01:33:07.671
Pull yourself
together, Palfrey.


1498
01:33:07.706 --> 01:33:10.341
We're not alone!

1499
01:33:13.545 --> 01:33:16.179
I do apologise,
ladies and gentlemen.


1500
01:33:16.214 --> 01:33:18.616
Events seem to have taken
a most unfortunate turn.


1501
01:33:18.651 --> 01:33:21.019
This sort of calamity
we cannot always guard against,


1502
01:33:21.553 --> 01:33:23.653
even amongst our best students.

1503
01:33:23.688 --> 01:33:28.493
You see, once... once sincerity
rears its ugly head,


1504
01:33:29.027 --> 01:33:31.696
well, Lifemanship is powerless.

1505
01:33:35.967 --> 01:33:38.637
Stop that music.

1506
01:33:40.238 --> 01:33:41.805
Orchestra!

1507
01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:46.111
Orchestra,
stop that infernal din!


1508
01:33:48.246 --> 01:33:50.881
Oh, please! No.

1509
01:33:50.916 --> 01:33:53.051
Forgive me, I must
get back to Yeovil.
