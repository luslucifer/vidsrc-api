1
00:03:14.975 --> 00:03:17.894
We should've talked at the boatyard.

2
00:03:17.978 --> 00:03:20.230
You don't wanna talk about it here.

3
00:03:20.314 --> 00:03:24.901
I'm not falling all over myself
to talk about it much of anywhere, Jack.


4
00:03:24.985 --> 00:03:26.653
How much do you know?

5
00:03:26.737 --> 00:03:27.737
Not much.

6
00:03:32.534 --> 00:03:35.995
The Birmingham one was in the papers
over a month ago.


7
00:03:37.456 --> 00:03:39.958
The second one in Atlanta
was all over TV.


8
00:03:40.793 --> 00:03:42.168
Did you ever think
about giving me a call?


9
00:03:42.253 --> 00:03:43.920
No.

10
00:03:44.004 --> 00:03:45.546
Why not?

11
00:03:45.631 --> 00:03:47.173
I quit. Remember?

12
00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:54.013
You look all right now.

13
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.809
I am all right.

14
00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:13.616
If you can't look anymore,
I understand.


15
00:04:14.702 --> 00:04:17.537
Don't try to run a
game down on me, Jack.

16
00:04:24.003 --> 00:04:27.381
If I really didn't need you to come back,
I wouldn't ask.


17
00:04:27.465 --> 00:04:28.924
This guy's on a lunar cycle.

18
00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:32.511
I have three weeks and a few days
until the next full moon.


19
00:04:32.595 --> 00:04:37.433
We have a better chance to get him fast
if you help.


20
00:05:20.935 --> 00:05:22.728
I'll think about it.

21
00:05:23.646 --> 00:05:25.105
Stay and eat.

22
00:05:35.867 --> 00:05:37.242
Hi, Molly.

23
00:05:49.964 --> 00:05:51.340
Think it'll keep them out, Dad?

24
00:05:51.424 --> 00:05:52.549
Yep.

25
00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:57.221
How many turtle eggs
do you think are in here?


26
00:05:57.305 --> 00:05:58.305
In this hatchery?

27
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.641
I'll bet there's 40 or 50 of them.

28
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.561
Crabs get most of the newborns, huh?

29
00:06:04.646 --> 00:06:06.438
Yeah, but not now.

30
00:06:06.523 --> 00:06:08.982
These are all gonna make it, guaranteed.

31
00:06:12.612 --> 00:06:14.863
What about the dogs?
Are they gonna get in here?


32
00:06:14.948 --> 00:06:16.240
They can't dig under.

33
00:06:16.324 --> 00:06:19.118
That's why we bury the wire
down in the sand.


34
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.831
We need more staples, pal.

35
00:06:33.007 --> 00:06:34.425
You're supposed to be his friend, Jack.

36
00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.636
Why didn't you leave him alone?

37
00:06:39.013 --> 00:06:41.765
If he decides to do it, Molly,

38
00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:45.520
I'll keep him as far away from it
as I can.


39
00:07:01.412 --> 00:07:02.954
We got it pretty good, don't we?

40
00:07:03.038 --> 00:07:05.123
We have it more than good.

41
00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.252
All that happened to you before
lets you know that.


42
00:07:12.339 --> 00:07:15.550
If I went back,
I'd only look at evidence.


43
00:07:16.886 --> 00:07:19.220
I wouldn't get deeply involved.

44
00:07:19.722 --> 00:07:22.390
He'd never even see me
or know my name.


45
00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:26.436
If they find him,
they'll have to take him down, not me.


46
00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:31.858
What do you think?

47
00:07:35.404 --> 00:07:39.157
I think you've already decided
and you're not really asking.


48
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:44.078
If I were asking?

49
00:07:46.123 --> 00:07:48.124
Stay here with me,

50
00:07:48.584 --> 00:07:50.084
me and Kevin.

51
00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:53.379
But it's selfish, and I know it.

52
00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:00.845
Come here.

53
00:08:59.363 --> 00:09:03.116
I'll come inside with you, if you want,
to show you around.


54
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.754
Mr. Crawford said maybe
you'd want to be alone, but--


55
00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:17.339
That's right.

56
00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:22.469
There's a VCR hooked up
in your hotel room.


57
00:09:23.638 --> 00:09:27.975
They transferred some home movies
of both families onto half-inch VHS.


58
00:09:28.059 --> 00:09:29.310
Thanks.

59
00:11:13.248 --> 00:11:15.499
Intruder entered through kitchen sliding door.

60
00:11:15.583 --> 00:11:18.293
Used a glass cutter
anchored to a suction cup.

61
00:11:18.378 --> 00:11:20.170
His entry was skillful.

62
00:11:21.923 --> 00:11:24.300
All the prints are smooth gloves.

63
00:11:24.677 --> 00:11:28.513
Blond hair, strong, size 12 shoe imprint.

64
00:11:30.266 --> 00:11:34.853
Blood AB positive, typed from saliva on glass
from licking the suction cup.


65
00:11:35.771 --> 00:11:39.107
Why didn't he care
that he left saliva on the glass?


66
00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:45.447
It was hot out that night,

67
00:11:45.531 --> 00:11:48.658
so inside the house
must have felt cool to him.


68
00:11:52.913 --> 00:11:55.331
Intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat
as he was rising,


69
00:11:55.416 --> 00:11:57.417
then shot Mrs. Leeds.

70
00:11:57.501 --> 00:11:59.878
Bullet entered right of her navel
and lodged in her lumbar spine,


71
00:11:59.962 --> 00:12:02.630
but she died of strangulation.

72
00:12:02.715 --> 00:12:04.966
Moderate elevation of serotonin
and marked increase


73
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:06.468
of free histamine level in gunshot wound

74
00:12:06.552 --> 00:12:10.472
indicates she lived at least
five minutes after she was shot.


75
00:12:11.891 --> 00:12:14.476
All her other injuries were post-mortem.

76
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:19.147
Direction and velocity of bloodstains on east wall
indicate arterial spray.


77
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.649
Even with his throat cut,
Leeds tried to fight


78
00:12:21.734 --> 00:12:25.195
because the intruder was moving
to the children's room.


79
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.407
Bloodstains on west wall of master bedroom

80
00:12:29.492 --> 00:12:32.744
and matted sliding marks on hall carpet
remain unexplained,


81
00:12:35.206 --> 00:12:38.416
as does superficial ligature mark
around Mr. Leeds' chest,


82
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.586
also believed to be post-mortem.

83
00:12:45.174 --> 00:12:48.635
What did the killer do with them
after they were dead?


84
00:13:19.208 --> 00:13:21.167
<i>Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.</i>

85
00:13:21.252 --> 00:13:22.877
<i>Sorry, I can't come
to the phone right now,</i>

86
00:13:22.962 --> 00:13:25.755
<i>but if you'd like to leave a message
please do so after the beep,</i>


87
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.841
<i>and I'll call you back
as soon as I can.</i>


88
00:13:42.606 --> 00:13:44.483
<i>Twenty-ninth floor.</i>

89
00:13:47.112 --> 00:13:48.404
<i>Going up.</i>

90
00:14:08.508 --> 00:14:11.176
When they were dead,

91
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:13.387
he smashed the mirrors
and began selecting pieces


92
00:14:13.471 --> 00:14:15.764
that he would use later on Mrs. Leeds.

93
00:14:18.143 --> 00:14:22.146
Killing Mr. Leeds and the children
would take less than a minute.


94
00:14:23.481 --> 00:14:27.151
Mrs. Leeds' injuries were post-mortem,
four or five minutes later.


95
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:31.405
What did he do in the interval?

96
00:14:35.243 --> 00:14:38.078
The smeared bloodstains on the west wall...

97
00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:24.875
- Hello?
- <i>Molly?</i>


98
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.794
<i>Will, is that you?</i>

99
00:15:26.878 --> 00:15:28.379
Yeah, it's me, honey.

100
00:15:29.673 --> 00:15:33.175
Look, I'll call you tomorrow.
Go back to sleep.


101
00:15:34.844 --> 00:15:36.261
<i>I love you.</i>

102
00:15:36.888 --> 00:15:38.555
I love you too, baby.

103
00:16:26.022 --> 00:16:27.939
What are you dreaming?

104
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.405
That's something you can't afford for me
to know about, isn't it?


105
00:16:39.201 --> 00:16:41.453
God, she's lovely, isn't she?

106
00:16:46.542 --> 00:16:50.920
It was maddening to have to touch her
with rubber gloves on, wasn't it?


107
00:16:51.797 --> 00:16:54.215
They found talcum powder on her leg,

108
00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.177
but there wasn't any talcum powder
in the bathroom.


109
00:17:02.183 --> 00:17:03.767
The talcum powder came out
of a rubber glove


110
00:17:03.851 --> 00:17:06.311
as you pulled it off to touch her.

111
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:11.232
You took off your gloves
to touch her, didn't you?


112
00:17:12.568 --> 00:17:13.985
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?

113
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:15.737
You touched her with your bare hands,

114
00:17:15.821 --> 00:17:18.281
and then you put your gloves back on.

115
00:17:18.365 --> 00:17:21.159
But while your gloves were off,

116
00:17:21.243 --> 00:17:24.662
did you open all their eyes
so that they could see you?


117
00:17:38.052 --> 00:17:39.052
<i>Hello?</i>

118
00:17:39.136 --> 00:17:41.012
Jack, this is Graham.

119
00:17:41.639 --> 00:17:43.431
Is Price still in Latent Prints?

120
00:17:43.516 --> 00:17:47.268
<i>Yeah, he's in charge
of the Single Print Index now.</i>


121
00:17:47.353 --> 00:17:48.812
<i>What do you got, Will?</i>

122
00:17:48.896 --> 00:17:49.938
Get him to Atlanta.

123
00:17:50.022 --> 00:17:51.773
<i>Atlanta PD swears they dusted everything,</i>

124
00:17:51.857 --> 00:17:52.899
<i>and their guy is pretty good.</i>

125
00:17:52.983 --> 00:17:54.651
He is good.
He's not as good as Price.


126
00:17:54.735 --> 00:17:56.361
<i>I'll get him on
a plane in the morning.</i>

127
00:17:56.445 --> 00:17:58.905
<i>What do you want him to do?</i>

128
00:18:00.116 --> 00:18:02.450
Dust Mrs. Leeds' finger and toenails

129
00:18:02.535 --> 00:18:04.494
and the corneas of all their eyes.

130
00:18:06.372 --> 00:18:08.373
I think he took off his gloves, Jack.

131
00:18:12.378 --> 00:18:15.421
Our people swear he wore surgeon's gloves
the whole time.


132
00:18:15.506 --> 00:18:17.507
They dusted everything.

133
00:18:17.591 --> 00:18:19.634
Your report didn't mention eyes.

134
00:18:20.427 --> 00:18:22.971
Why do you think
he took his gloves off?

135
00:18:23.055 --> 00:18:25.432
Because Mrs. Leeds was a beautiful woman.

136
00:18:27.102 --> 00:18:29.854
This is what the subject's teeth looked like.

137
00:18:29.938 --> 00:18:32.565
The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed these

138
00:18:32.649 --> 00:18:34.441
from the impressions that we took
of the bite marks


139
00:18:34.526 --> 00:18:35.693
on the Leeds woman here

140
00:18:35.777 --> 00:18:39.029
and the Jacobi woman in Birmingham last month.

141
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.367
As you can see,
he has pegged lateral incisors,


142
00:18:43.451 --> 00:18:45.870
that's these teeth here and here.

143
00:18:48.331 --> 00:18:49.623
All right, Vice and Narcotics,

144
00:18:49.708 --> 00:18:51.876
you take the K
-Y cowboys and leather bars.

145
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.752
Marcus, Whitman, heads up at the funeral.

146
00:18:53.837 --> 00:18:56.630
The rest of your assignments
are on the sheet. Let's go.


147
00:18:56.715 --> 00:18:58.382
One more thing.

148
00:18:58.466 --> 00:19:02.011
I've heard officers referring to this killer
as the Tooth Fairy.


149
00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:04.513
Well, I don't want
to hear that in public,

150
00:19:04.598 --> 00:19:06.724
and I don't want to see it
in internal memoranda.


151
00:19:06.808 --> 00:19:08.142
That's it.

152
00:19:22.949 --> 00:19:25.034
I know a burglar's
gonna fence what he stole

153
00:19:25.118 --> 00:19:27.453
'cause his motive is cash money.

154
00:19:27.537 --> 00:19:30.456
I know his motive,
so I go to work on fences.


155
00:19:31.041 --> 00:19:33.375
This guy, we don't even have motive.

156
00:19:33.793 --> 00:19:37.046
None of us have shit,
and we know it.


157
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:38.631
It's in his dreams.

158
00:19:39.382 --> 00:19:41.091
- His motive?
- Yeah.


159
00:19:42.636 --> 00:19:44.678
His act fuels his fantasy.

160
00:19:45.222 --> 00:19:46.513
Which is?

161
00:19:47.933 --> 00:19:49.141
I don't know.

162
00:19:49.267 --> 00:19:51.060
The commissioner was saying
that you're the one


163
00:19:51.144 --> 00:19:53.520
who got Garrett Jacob Hobbs,

164
00:19:53.605 --> 00:19:55.981
and then Dr. Lecktor three years ago.

165
00:19:56.274 --> 00:19:58.025
Lecktor killed nine people, didn't he?

166
00:19:58.109 --> 00:20:00.694
Nine that we know of.
Two didn't die.


167
00:20:01.738 --> 00:20:03.614
What happened to them?

168
00:20:04.157 --> 00:20:05.908
One's on a respirator
at a hospital in Baltimore,

169
00:20:05.992 --> 00:20:08.244
the other's in a
private mental hospital in Denver.

170
00:20:08.328 --> 00:20:11.789
What did the psychologists
say was wrong with Lecktor?


171
00:20:13.333 --> 00:20:15.751
The psychologists call him a psychopath.

172
00:20:16.169 --> 00:20:18.420
They don't know what else to call him.

173
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.343
I understand he cut you pretty good.

174
00:20:28.181 --> 00:20:29.974
What about the dog?

175
00:20:32.269 --> 00:20:36.230
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in
with a puncture wound in the abdomen.


176
00:20:36.314 --> 00:20:38.524
The Jacobis in Birmingham had a cat,
didn't they?


177
00:20:38.608 --> 00:20:39.942
That's right.

178
00:20:40.694 --> 00:20:44.155
We found a litter box downstairs,
but we didn't find a cat.


179
00:20:44.532 --> 00:20:47.784
Why don't you get Birmingham PD
a methane probe out of Washington,


180
00:20:47.868 --> 00:20:49.452
have them cover the back yard.

181
00:20:49.537 --> 00:20:52.497
Maybe the cat's dead
and the kids buried it.


182
00:20:54.417 --> 00:20:55.217
Yeah?

183
00:20:55.301 --> 00:20:56.543
<i>This is Jimmy Price, FBI.</i>

184
00:20:57.545 --> 00:20:58.962
Let me put you on speakerphone.

185
00:20:59.046 --> 00:21:00.547
<i>Who am I talking to?</i>

186
00:21:00.631 --> 00:21:01.673
Jimmy, it's Jack Crawford.

187
00:21:01.757 --> 00:21:02.924
You got Will Graham here, too.

188
00:21:03.009 --> 00:21:06.344
<i>I got a partial print with a tented arch,
it's probably a thumb.</i>


189
00:21:06.429 --> 00:21:10.223
<i>And the fragment of a palm off the nail
of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe.</i>


190
00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:13.226
<i>Thumbprint came off
the oldest kid's left eye.</i>


191
00:21:13.311 --> 00:21:14.936
<i>It stood out against
an eight-ball hemorrhage</i>


192
00:21:15.021 --> 00:21:16.146
<i>from the gunshot wound.</i>

193
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.064
Can we make an identification off of it?

194
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:21.443
<i>Maybe, if he's ever been printed
and he's in my index.</i>


195
00:21:21.944 --> 00:21:23.445
<i>I want to work these up
in my own darkroom.</i>


196
00:21:23.529 --> 00:21:25.739
<i>I'll fax the prints down to you
this afternoon.</i>


197
00:21:25.823 --> 00:21:27.240
Thanks, Jimmy.

198
00:21:40.838 --> 00:21:42.172
No comment.

199
00:21:45.593 --> 00:21:48.053
If we get lucky
with that print, we're in,

200
00:21:48.137 --> 00:21:49.554
if Jimmy can find him in the index

201
00:21:49.638 --> 00:21:51.139
and if he's ever been printed.

202
00:21:51.223 --> 00:21:52.182
- If not, I don't know.
- Hey, Will Graham!


203
00:21:52.266 --> 00:21:54.184
What do you say? 
You remember me?

204
00:21:54.268 --> 00:21:56.186
Freddie Lounds, covered the Lecktor case
for the <i>Tattler,</i>


205
00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:57.562
did the paperback.

206
00:21:57.646 --> 00:21:59.898
So, Will, when did they call you in?
What do you got?


207
00:21:59.982 --> 00:22:01.149
Hey, look, I'm buying lunch.

208
00:22:01.233 --> 00:22:02.359
Lounds, why don't you give it a rest?

209
00:22:02.443 --> 00:22:04.611
Hey, he's news. 
I'm doing my job.

210
00:22:04.695 --> 00:22:08.156
So, how does this guy compare with Lecktor?
How does he do them?


211
00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:11.117
How's he do them, Will?

212
00:22:14.038 --> 00:22:15.872
Keep the fuck away from me.

213
00:22:15.956 --> 00:22:17.207
Will, Will.

214
00:22:25.591 --> 00:22:28.176
Son of a bitch snuck into the hospital
while I was sedated after Lecktor.


215
00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.512
He pulled back the sheets,
and he took pictures.


216
00:22:30.596 --> 00:22:31.638
Yeah, I know.

217
00:22:31.722 --> 00:22:33.890
Look, don't expect too much from me,
all right?


218
00:22:33.974 --> 00:22:36.142
We only got three weeks left,
and you're our best shot.


219
00:22:36.227 --> 00:22:39.145
You think I'm gonna see him standing in the street
and say, "There he is"?


220
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.815
That's Houdini you're thinking about.

221
00:22:43.734 --> 00:22:46.694
The Tooth Fairy's gonna go on
until we get smart or get lucky.


222
00:22:46.779 --> 00:22:47.737
He won't stop.

223
00:22:47.822 --> 00:22:48.863
Why?

224
00:22:49.573 --> 00:22:51.616
He's got a genuine taste for it.

225
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.452
You do know something about him.

226
00:22:55.704 --> 00:22:57.163
Not enough.

227
00:23:00.292 --> 00:23:02.419
I think I'll go see Lecktor tomorrow.

228
00:23:02.503 --> 00:23:03.754
Why?

229
00:23:05.173 --> 00:23:06.841
Recover the mindset.

230
00:23:39.583 --> 00:23:44.044
That's the same atrocious aftershave
you wore in court three years ago.


231
00:23:44.129 --> 00:23:46.422
Yeah, I keep getting it for Christmas.

232
00:23:50.552 --> 00:23:52.428
Did you get my card?

233
00:23:52.512 --> 00:23:53.554
I got it. Thank you.

234
00:23:54.306 --> 00:23:57.808
How is Officer Stewart?
The one who was first to see my basement.


235
00:23:57.893 --> 00:23:59.393
Stewart's fine.

236
00:23:59.478 --> 00:24:01.604
Emotional problems, I hear.

237
00:24:01.688 --> 00:24:03.272
Do you have any problems, Will?

238
00:24:03.356 --> 00:24:04.690
No.

239
00:24:04.774 --> 00:24:06.859
No, of course you don't.

240
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.363
I'm glad you came.

241
00:24:11.698 --> 00:24:14.408
My callers are mostly clinical psychologists

242
00:24:14.493 --> 00:24:16.785
from cornfield universities somewhere.

243
00:24:16.912 --> 00:24:18.537
Second-raters, the lot.

244
00:24:18.622 --> 00:24:20.831
Dr. Bloom showed me your article
on surgical addiction


245
00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:22.541
in the <i>Journal of Clinical Psychiatry.</i>

246
00:24:22.626 --> 00:24:23.626
And?

247
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:24.835
Very interesting.

248
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.670
Even to a layman.

249
00:24:28.465 --> 00:24:30.758
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.

250
00:24:30.842 --> 00:24:33.844
Yes, I thought so.

251
00:24:33.929 --> 00:24:35.054
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.

252
00:24:35.138 --> 00:24:36.347
Yes?

253
00:24:36.431 --> 00:24:37.431
You read about it?

254
00:24:37.516 --> 00:24:39.016
In the papers.

255
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.310
I don't tear out the articles.

256
00:24:41.394 --> 00:24:45.397
I wouldn't want them to think
I was dwelling on anything morbid.


257
00:24:47.901 --> 00:24:50.611
You want to know how he's choosing them,
don't you?


258
00:24:50.695 --> 00:24:51.862
I thought you might have some ideas.

259
00:24:51.947 --> 00:24:53.113
Why should I tell you?

260
00:24:53.198 --> 00:24:55.616
You'd get to see
the file on this case.

261
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.700
And there's another reason.

262
00:24:56.785 --> 00:24:58.035
Pray tell.

263
00:24:58.119 --> 00:24:59.453
Thought you might be curious to see

264
00:24:59.538 --> 00:25:01.205
if you're smarter
than the person I'm looking for.


265
00:25:01.289 --> 00:25:04.041
Then by implication you think
you're smarter than me, since you caught me.


266
00:25:04.125 --> 00:25:06.502
No. I know that
I'm not smarter than you.

267
00:25:06.586 --> 00:25:08.212
Then how did you catch me?

268
00:25:08.296 --> 00:25:09.255
You had disadvantages.

269
00:25:09.339 --> 00:25:10.673
What disadvantages?

270
00:25:10.757 --> 00:25:12.216
You're insane.

271
00:25:14.302 --> 00:25:16.136
You are very tan, Will.

272
00:25:17.389 --> 00:25:18.931
Your hands are rough.

273
00:25:20.642 --> 00:25:23.103
They don't look like cop's hands anymore.

274
00:25:23.729 --> 00:25:26.481
And that shaving lotion
is something a child would select.


275
00:25:26.566 --> 00:25:29.067
It has a ship
on the bottle, doesn't it?

276
00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:34.864
Don't think you can persuade me
with appeals to my intellectual vanity.


277
00:25:34.949 --> 00:25:37.742
I don't think I'll persuade you at all.

278
00:25:37.827 --> 00:25:40.161
You'll either do it or you won't.

279
00:25:40.997 --> 00:25:44.583
Besides, we have Dr. Bloom working on it,
and he's the best.


280
00:25:44.667 --> 00:25:46.418
- Do you have the file with you?
- Yes.


281
00:25:46.502 --> 00:25:47.669
- Pictures?
- Yes.


282
00:25:47.753 --> 00:25:49.462
Let me have them,
and I might consider it.

283
00:25:49.547 --> 00:25:50.880
No.

284
00:25:54.844 --> 00:25:56.344
Dream much, Will?

285
00:25:56.429 --> 00:25:58.054
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.

286
00:25:58.681 --> 00:26:01.516
You haven't threatened
to take away my books yet.


287
00:26:04.061 --> 00:26:07.022
Let me have the file,
and I'll tell you what I think.


288
00:27:08.584 --> 00:27:10.627
This is a very shy boy, Will.

289
00:27:11.629 --> 00:27:13.004
What were their yards like?

290
00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:16.257
Big back yards. 
Fences, hedges.

291
00:27:17.843 --> 00:27:18.843
Why?

292
00:27:18.928 --> 00:27:20.220
Because, my dear Will,

293
00:27:20.304 --> 00:27:23.390
if this pilgrim imagines
he has a relationship with the moon,


294
00:27:23.474 --> 00:27:25.767
he might go outside to look at it.

295
00:27:27.144 --> 00:27:29.354
Have you ever seen blood
in the moonlight?


296
00:27:29.438 --> 00:27:31.272
It appears quite black.

297
00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:36.486
If one were nude, it would be better
to have privacy for this sort of thing.


298
00:27:37.571 --> 00:27:38.947
That's interesting.

299
00:27:39.031 --> 00:27:41.282
No, it's not.
You thought of it before.


300
00:27:41.367 --> 00:27:42.868
I considered it.

301
00:27:42.953 --> 00:27:46.247
You came here to look at me,
to get the old scent back again, didn't you?


302
00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:47.581
I want your opinion.

303
00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:49.250
I don't have one right now.

304
00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:52.086
Well, when you have one,
I'd like to hear it.


305
00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.170
Can I keep this?

306
00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:54.255
I haven't decided yet.

307
00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:55.548
I'll study them.

308
00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:57.383
When you get more files,
I'd like to see them, too.


309
00:27:57.467 --> 00:28:00.886
You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer,
they bring me a telephone.


310
00:28:00.971 --> 00:28:04.265
Would you like to leave me
your home phone number?


311
00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:05.850
No.

312
00:28:07.811 --> 00:28:08.894
Do you know how you caught me?

313
00:28:08.979 --> 00:28:10.855
Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor.
You can leave messages for me.


314
00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:14.191
Do you know how you caught me?

315
00:28:14.276 --> 00:28:17.653
The reason you caught me, Will,

317
00:28:21.324 --> 00:28:22.992

I'd be immensely appreciative if you

<i>we are beginning our descent

369
00:36:33.527 --> 00:36:36.571
You used a cutting tool on the branch
so that you could see.


370
00:36:36.656 --> 00:36:38.823
Then you passed the time whittling

371
00:36:39.867 --> 00:36:41.576
and dreaming.

372
00:36:43.579 --> 00:36:45.080
When night came,

373
00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.833
you saw them pass by their bright windows.

374
00:36:49.418 --> 00:36:51.836
Then you watched the shades go down,

375
00:36:52.672 --> 00:36:55.423
then you saw the lights go out,
one by one.


376
00:36:55.925 --> 00:36:57.968
Then after a while, you climbed down

377
00:36:58.052 --> 00:37:00.262
and you went in to them,
didn't you?


378
00:37:00.346 --> 00:37:01.430
Didn't you, you son of a bitch?

379
00:37:01.515 --> 00:37:04.350
You watched them all goddamned day long!

380
00:37:07.604 --> 00:37:09.730
That's why houses with big yards.

381
00:37:14.653 --> 00:37:17.738
I need Firearms and Tool Marks section
out here on a severed branch.


382
00:37:17.823 --> 00:37:19.490
I need to know
what kind of cutting tool he used.


383
00:37:19.574 --> 00:37:21.659
And then I need Bowman in Documents
to fall on this carving.


384
00:37:21.743 --> 00:37:22.743
<i>Is it weird?</i>

385
00:37:22.828 --> 00:37:24.078
The mark? Yeah.

386
00:37:24.371 --> 00:37:26.956
If Documents can't do the carving,
I'll send it up to Langley.


387
00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:28.958
<i>Did Price get an identification
off the Leeds print?</i>


388
00:37:29.042 --> 00:37:30.918
No, Price hasn't found him

389
00:37:31.003 --> 00:37:33.504
<i>It's a hand search.

Listen, have you seen this week's <i>Tattler?</i>

391
00:37:36.783 --> 00:37:38.801
It's not on my preferred reading list, Jack.

392
00:37:38.885 --> 00:37:39.969
<i>Well, uh--</i>

393
00:37:40.053 --> 00:37:42.430
your picture's all over the front page.

394
00:37:44.516 --> 00:37:45.474

395
00:37:45.559 --> 00:37:46.976
Of course. Who else?

396
00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.936
God damn it, Jack!

397
00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:51.647
I promised Molly! 
I promised her!

398
00:37:53.859 --> 00:37:55.026

Yes?

401
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.489
When we were cleaning out Dr. 
Lecktor's cell,

402
00:38:00.574 --> 00:38:02.408
he heard us coming
and hid something in a book.


403
00:38:02.492 --> 00:38:03.784
We got him out of there
and dug around.


404
00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:05.619
- Is that it?
- Yes.


405
00:38:05.704 --> 00:38:08.039
Put it down on my desk, Bonner.

406
00:38:15.922 --> 00:38:17.423
Has anyone else seen this except you?

407
00:38:17.507 --> 00:38:19.258
No.

<i>Special Agent Crawford's office.</i>

This is Dr. Chilton.

410
00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:27.308
I need to speak to Mr. 
Graham right away.

411

<i>He's not here, he's in Birmingham.</i>

<i>Special Agent Crawford

413
00:38:30.937 --> 00:38:33.022
Please tell them this is very, very urgent.

414
00:38:33.106 --> 00:38:34.106
I'll hold on.

415
00:38:37.903 --> 00:38:39.278
Dr. Chilton, it's Jack Crawford.

416
00:38:39.363 --> 00:38:40.863

who killed those people in Atlanta.


419
00:38:46.995 --> 00:38:48.746
Dr. Chilton, where did you get it?

420
00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:50.873
In Hannibal Lecktor's cell.
It was hidden in a book.


421

<i>Dr. Chilton, don't touch the note.
Can you read it to us?</i>

00:38:54.461 --> 00:38:56.420
It's written on toilet tissue.

I want to replace it in Lecktor's cell.

451

I don't want Lecktor to know

he might try to warn the killer somehow.

possibly from the Tooth Fairy,
number one priority.

One hair, Graham.
Maybe half an inch.


463
00:41:15.228 --> 00:41:16.561
And a couple of blue grains.

464

Work the hair.

What do we have for negative comparison?

466

Hair from Lecktor's comb,
whiskers from Lecktor's razor they let him use.


467
00:41:25.279 --> 00:41:27.864
This is hair from the security guard.

How many guys handled this without gloves?

469

The guard, cleanup man, Lecktor.

470

The cleanup man scrubbing sinks,

00:41:55.477 --> 00:41:58.479
probably had the oil
washed off his fingers.


472
00:41:58.897 --> 00:42:00.690
But the others--

473
00:42:00.857 --> 00:42:01.983
One smudge.

474
00:42:06.154 --> 00:42:07.154
Those aren't ridges.

475
00:42:07.239 --> 00:42:09.824
It's just the texture of the paper.

476
00:42:09.908 --> 00:42:11.075
I can fume for a print,

477
00:42:11.159 --> 00:42:13.411
but can't guarantee
the iodine stains would fade out.


478
00:42:13.495 --> 00:42:14.912
Ninhydrin? Boost it with heat?

479
00:42:14.997 --> 00:42:16.038
No.

480
00:42:16.123 --> 00:42:18.374
We couldn't wash it after.

481
00:42:18.458 --> 00:42:21.335
I can't get a print off this in the time
you've got to get it back, Will.


482
00:42:22.212 --> 00:42:23.254
How long do I have?

483
00:42:23.338 --> 00:42:24.338
Twenty minutes, max.

484
00:42:24.423 --> 00:42:25.590
The main thing to find out is,

485
00:42:25.674 --> 00:42:28.050
how was Lecktor supposed
to reply to him?


486
00:42:28.135 --> 00:42:30.928
Which is probably the missing section,
because at the top it says,


487
00:42:31.013 --> 00:42:34.140
"I hope we can correspond,"
then comes the gap.


488
00:42:36.351 --> 00:42:38.519
This note was written in ballpoint,

489
00:42:39.104 --> 00:42:42.690
but it looks like Lecktor went over this area
with a felt-tip pen,


490
00:42:43.233 --> 00:42:45.109
then tore it away.

491
00:43:13.555 --> 00:43:16.140
You're so sly,

492
00:43:16.224 --> 00:43:17.975
but so am I.

493
00:43:25.233 --> 00:43:29.945
The aniline dyes used in the ink
of the felt-tip pens like Lecktor used


494
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:32.198
are transparent to infrared.

495
00:43:32.282 --> 00:43:35.076
The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't.

496
00:43:43.001 --> 00:43:45.920
This looks like the tip of a T here,
here, and here.


497
00:43:46.296 --> 00:43:48.881
At the end is what could be
the top of an R.


498
00:43:49.466 --> 00:43:51.175
There's three Ts and an R in <i>"Tattler".</i>

499
00:43:51.259 --> 00:43:52.343
We know our boy reads it.

500
00:43:52.427 --> 00:43:54.053
The article about me and Lecktor.

501
00:43:54.137 --> 00:43:56.681
I don't know anybody else
that's carried that.


502
00:43:57.557 --> 00:43:58.849
Personal ads.

503
00:44:02.313 --> 00:44:05.190
We believe the Tooth Fairy told Lecktor
to reply to him


504
00:44:05.274 --> 00:44:08.151
through the personal ad section
of the <i>National Tattler.</i>


505
00:44:08.236 --> 00:44:11.279
The Chicago office is down there right now
running through their ads.


506
00:44:11.364 --> 00:44:13.532
We have cut into a line of communication

507
00:44:13.616 --> 00:44:15.701
between the Tooth Fairy and Lecktor.

508
00:44:15.785 --> 00:44:18.495
If we find Lecktor's reply
we plan to pull it,


509
00:44:18.579 --> 00:44:20.580
substitute it with one of our own.

510
00:44:20.665 --> 00:44:23.458
And this is what the Tooth Fairy
will read. Bill?


511
00:44:23.543 --> 00:44:27.462
"Dear Avid Fan, inherit my mantle
and surpass my achievements.


512
00:44:27.547 --> 00:44:30.757
"Mementoes for you at Baltimore
Central Left Luggage.


513
00:44:30.842 --> 00:44:32.968
"Ticket number 72683."

514
00:44:33.636 --> 00:44:35.679
It's a Secret Service letter drop.

515
00:44:35.763 --> 00:44:36.888
We plan to stake it out.

516
00:44:36.973 --> 00:44:38.056
When he shows, we'll grab him.

517
00:44:38.141 --> 00:44:39.891
- Anything from Chicago?
- Not yet.


518
00:44:39.976 --> 00:44:41.893
When do they go to press?

519
00:44:41.978 --> 00:44:43.395
Thirty-five minutes.

520
00:44:43.479 --> 00:44:45.188
- Christ.
- Let's get to the physical.


521
00:44:45.273 --> 00:44:46.815
There was no print.

522
00:44:46.899 --> 00:44:48.650
Scale counts and core size of the hair

523
00:44:48.735 --> 00:44:51.153
match the blond hair found in the Jacobis'.

524
00:44:51.237 --> 00:44:53.655
That note was written by your man.

525
00:44:54.490 --> 00:44:56.074
Aside from the hair, three blue grains,

526
00:44:56.159 --> 00:44:58.034
dark flecks, went to Brian's end.

527
00:44:58.119 --> 00:45:00.746
The grains are commercial granulated cleanser
with chlorine,


528
00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:01.788
from the cleaning man.

529
00:45:01.873 --> 00:45:04.207
Several particles of dried blood,
but not enough to type.


530
00:45:06.669 --> 00:45:08.462
<i>This is Chester. 
Who am I talking to?</i>

531
00:45:08.546 --> 00:45:10.088
Will Graham, Jack Crawford.

532
00:45:10.173 --> 00:45:13.800
<i>Got a personal ad with "Avid Fan" in it
being telexed to you right now.</i>


533
00:45:13.885 --> 00:45:15.844
- Read it.
- <i>"Dear Avid Fan,</i>


534
00:45:15.928 --> 00:45:17.554
<i>"You honor me. 
You're very beautiful."</i>

535
00:45:17.638 --> 00:45:18.722
Oh, Christ.

536
00:45:18.806 --> 00:45:21.183
<i>"I offer 100 prayers for your safety.</i>

537
00:45:21.768 --> 00:45:26.730
<i>"Find help in Galatians 6:11, 15:2,</i>

538
00:45:26.814 --> 00:45:30.776
<i>"Acts 3:3, Revelations 18:7,</i>

539
00:45:31.694 --> 00:45:35.197
<i>"Jonah 6:8, 
John 6:22,</i>

540
00:45:35.823 --> 00:45:37.532
<i>"Luke 1:7."</i>

541
00:45:38.034 --> 00:45:39.284
Thanks.

542
00:45:45.583 --> 00:45:47.125
Jimmy.

543
00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:49.294
Did you get anywhere at all
identifying him off the Leeds' prints?


544
00:45:49.378 --> 00:45:50.545
Not yet.

545
00:45:53.883 --> 00:45:55.425
Photography at Langley?

546
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:58.053
They got shot a telex.
They're on it now.


547
00:46:12.068 --> 00:46:15.153
No. And our ad has to go out
in the same book code Lecktor used,


548
00:46:15.238 --> 00:46:16.655
or he'll know it wasn't Lecktor
talking to him.


549
00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:17.823
Book code?

550
00:46:17.907 --> 00:46:19.449
"100 prayers" could be the page number,

551
00:46:19.534 --> 00:46:20.952
the paired numbers could be line and letter.

552
00:46:21.036 --> 00:46:22.203
- But what book?
- Not <i>The Bible?</i>


553
00:46:22.287 --> 00:46:23.287
No.

554
00:46:23.372 --> 00:46:24.330
Galatians 15:2.

555
00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:25.915
Galatians only has six chapters.

556
00:46:25.999 --> 00:46:26.999
The same with Jonah 6:8.

557
00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:28.668
Jonah only has four chapters.

558
00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:30.753
Lecktor was not using <i>The Bible.</i>

559
00:46:31.338 --> 00:46:33.923
Then the Tooth Fairy probably named the book
in the part Lecktor tore out.


560
00:46:34.007 --> 00:46:35.424
Right.

561
00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:37.969
What about sweating Lecktor?

562
00:46:38.053 --> 00:46:40.096
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago
to find where


563
00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:41.430
he buried a Princeton student.

564
00:46:41.515 --> 00:46:42.890
He gave them a
recipe for potato chip dip.

565
00:46:42.975 --> 00:46:44.058
Wonderful.

566
00:46:45.394 --> 00:46:48.771
The Tooth Fairy would have named a book
he knew Lecktor has access to.


567
00:46:48.856 --> 00:46:50.565
He'd know it from articles
he'd read about Lecktor.


568
00:46:50.649 --> 00:46:52.108
Willingham, when he tossed his cell,

569
00:46:52.192 --> 00:46:54.068
took Polaroids so they can
get everything back in place.


570
00:46:54.152 --> 00:46:56.779
Have him meet me
with pictures of Lecktor's books.


571
00:46:56.864 --> 00:46:58.698
- Where?
- Library of Congress.


572
00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:07.206
Twenty-five minutes.
He won't make it in time.


573
00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:10.334
Lecktor's ad runs as is,
we decode it later.


574
00:47:10.419 --> 00:47:14.547
Or we pull it, figure out the code
and run our own ad next week.


575
00:47:14.631 --> 00:47:15.590
And lose a week?

576
00:47:15.674 --> 00:47:16.716
We got 17 days
till the next full moon.

577
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.469
And I don't like Lecktor's ad running
without knowing what it says.


578
00:47:22.014 --> 00:47:23.806
It's your call, Will.

579
00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:27.977
Run it.

580
00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:33.024
And what if it encourages the Tooth Fairy
to do something else beside write?


581
00:47:33.108 --> 00:47:35.359
We'll all feel sick
for a very long time.


582
00:47:35.444 --> 00:47:38.779
And if Bowman still can't figure it out?

583
00:47:38.864 --> 00:47:41.407
Then we'll bait him with something else
in next week's <i>Tattler.</i>


584
00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:42.992
What, for instance?

585
00:47:45.537 --> 00:47:46.662
Me.

586
00:47:48.498 --> 00:47:50.791
I don't think that's a very good idea.

587
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:56.005
Why not?

588
00:47:56.089 --> 00:47:57.423
Don't you think we can provoke him?

589
00:47:57.507 --> 00:47:59.842
Maybe. Maybe he can be provoked.

590
00:47:59.927 --> 00:48:01.510
What I was thinking about is you.

591
00:48:03.388 --> 00:48:05.222
You're getting deeper and deeper into this.

592
00:48:05.307 --> 00:48:06.807
Good night.

593
00:48:06.892 --> 00:48:07.892
Sidney.

594
00:48:07.976 --> 00:48:09.018
I'll talk to you.

595
00:48:11.229 --> 00:48:12.939
Last time you did that
you did a real good job


596
00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:15.316
of pushing yourself all out of shape.

597
00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:18.527
You try it on again
or you go through some big trauma,


598
00:48:18.612 --> 00:48:20.780
you could relapse, my friend.

599
00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:22.990
Sidney, don't worry about me.

600
00:48:23.075 --> 00:48:26.243
I'm working the evidence, making moves.
That's all.


601
00:48:27.579 --> 00:48:28.829
I'm fine.

602
00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:33.209
Bowman just struck out.

603
00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:35.670
It is not books in Lecktor's cell.

604
00:48:36.338 --> 00:48:37.296
Price?

605
00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:38.714
He just heard. 
It's a bust-out.

606
00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:41.301
As evidence, the Leeds print
will get us a conviction


607
00:48:41.386 --> 00:48:43.261
if we could ever find the guy.

608
00:48:43.346 --> 00:48:46.598
But he must never have been printed
because he is not in our index.


609
00:48:46.683 --> 00:48:49.184
We are not gonna identify him
off the print.


610
00:48:52.605 --> 00:48:54.356
I'll use Lounds.

611
00:48:55.316 --> 00:48:56.566
What for?

612
00:48:57.318 --> 00:48:59.569
Our boy doesn't read
<i>The New York Times</i> literary supplement.


613
00:48:59.654 --> 00:49:01.655
He reads Lounds in the <i>Tattler.</i>

614
00:49:07.537 --> 00:49:08.704
What else should we cover?

615
00:49:08.788 --> 00:49:11.665
He put the shorts on Charles Leeds
after he was dead.


616
00:49:11.749 --> 00:49:15.252
I believe he did this to make sure
we wouldn't think he was gay.


617
00:49:18.756 --> 00:49:21.091
He's molested all of his male victims.

618
00:49:21.592 --> 00:49:24.511
He may be impotent
with members of the opposite sex.


619
00:49:25.013 --> 00:49:27.139
Our forensic psychologists have projected,

620
00:49:27.223 --> 00:49:29.099
though I'm not sure,

621
00:49:29.183 --> 00:49:31.852
that he may have had
sexual relations with his mother.


622
00:49:37.817 --> 00:49:41.028
So, how long do you plan
to stay in Washington?


623
00:49:41.112 --> 00:49:42.529
Till we've taken out the Tooth Fairy.

624
00:49:42.613 --> 00:49:44.781
Can the <i>Tattler</i> rely
on getting the straight stuff from you?


625
00:49:44.866 --> 00:49:45.866
Absolutely.

626
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:48.493
How does working on this case
affect your sex life?


627
00:49:48.578 --> 00:49:52.039
Mine? It doesn't affect mine, it affects yours.
Go fuck yourself.


628
00:49:52.123 --> 00:49:53.623
Look, pal of mine, you're news.

629
00:49:53.708 --> 00:49:55.167
Shoot the pictures.

630
00:49:55.251 --> 00:49:56.960
All right, Symie, let's shoot them.

631
00:49:57.045 --> 00:49:58.211
I'm in the shots with Graham.

632
00:49:58.296 --> 00:49:59.880
- What?
- I'm in the shots with you.


633
00:49:59.964 --> 00:50:02.549
Come on, you want this
to look real or not?


634
00:50:04.761 --> 00:50:08.055
Make sure the theater sign across the street
is just slightly out of focus.


635
00:50:08.139 --> 00:50:09.848
We want him to be able to read it
so he can find it,


636
00:50:09.932 --> 00:50:10.932
but we don't want to look too obvious.

637
00:50:11.017 --> 00:50:14.186
You make sure that I look excellent.
All right, shoot it.


638
00:50:16.022 --> 00:50:17.064
One more.

639
00:50:17.356 --> 00:50:19.149
- One more.
- That's enough.


640
00:50:19.317 --> 00:50:21.943
Okay, Graham. Hey, always nice, huh?

641
00:50:22.195 --> 00:50:23.695
Let's have lunch, call my service.

642
00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.781
Crawford, always a thrill.

643
00:50:25.865 --> 00:50:29.117
Dr. Bloom. I need them on my desk
in two hours.


644
00:50:38.336 --> 00:50:39.419
Did Bowman break the code yet?

645
00:50:39.504 --> 00:50:40.504
No.

646
00:50:40.755 --> 00:50:43.882
Tools and Firearms say the cutting tool
used on the severed branch


647
00:50:43.966 --> 00:50:45.926
was a common bolt cutter.

648
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:48.804
I got a call
from Asian Studies at Langley.

649
00:50:48.888 --> 00:50:50.639
- The mark you found on the tree?
- Yeah?


650
00:50:50.723 --> 00:50:54.768
It's a Chinese character
considered a lucky sign in gambling.


651
00:50:54.852 --> 00:50:57.938
That same character appears
on a Mah Jongg piece.


652
00:50:58.022 --> 00:51:01.067
It means "Red Dragon."
Mean anything to you?


653
00:51:04.071 --> 00:51:05.113
No.

654
00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:10.618
If he shows, and he's smart,

655
00:51:10.702 --> 00:51:13.121
he'll approach you from the front,
pass, turn,


656
00:51:13.205 --> 00:51:15.039
try and take you from behind.

657
00:51:15.124 --> 00:51:16.207
How's your hearing?

658
00:51:16.291 --> 00:51:17.291
It's good.

659
00:51:17.376 --> 00:51:18.501
You'll wear a wire, one-way.

660
00:51:18.585 --> 00:51:21.295
We'll hear you, you won't hear us.

661
00:51:21.964 --> 00:51:24.090
You checked out a Charter Arms
.44 Special Bulldog?


662
00:51:24.174 --> 00:51:25.174
Yeah.

663
00:51:25.259 --> 00:51:27.635
Load these in it.
You ever fire them?


664
00:51:27.719 --> 00:51:28.678
Glaser Safety Slugs.

665
00:51:28.762 --> 00:51:29.971
Yeah. Number 12 shots.

666
00:51:30.055 --> 00:51:32.807
Suspended in liquid Teflon
in a copper casing.


667
00:51:32.891 --> 00:51:35.351
On impact it all opens up
in the target.


668
00:51:35.435 --> 00:51:37.395
Guaranteed one-shot stop.

669
00:51:37.896 --> 00:51:38.938
You got body armor?

670
00:51:39.022 --> 00:51:41.149
Yeah, Kevlar Second Chance.

671
00:51:41.233 --> 00:51:42.275
I hope you get one.

672
00:51:42.359 --> 00:51:45.570
'Cause he's gone for the head shot
eight of eleven times?


673
00:51:47.197 --> 00:51:48.906
Let's walk the route.

674
00:52:11.805 --> 00:52:15.183
<i>United Flight 849 to Newark
now boarding at Gate 7.</i>


675
00:52:15.601 --> 00:52:18.352
<i>United Flight 849 to Newark
now boarding at Gate 7.</i>


676
00:53:27.507 --> 00:53:29.007
Someone's coming.

677
00:53:59.831 --> 00:54:00.914
Go!

678
00:54:07.463 --> 00:54:09.256
Don't! Don't move!

679
00:54:15.179 --> 00:54:16.805
Take the money!

680
00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.974
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

681
00:54:19.142 --> 00:54:21.268
Clear!

682
00:54:29.652 --> 00:54:32.321
What you moving in slow motion for, man?
I'm being mugged!


683
00:54:33.531 --> 00:54:34.990
For real. Can you believe that?

684
00:54:36.242 --> 00:54:37.409
Pay up.

685
00:54:38.453 --> 00:54:41.288
<i>...in sports, the Cubs lost again.</i>

686
00:54:42.415 --> 00:54:43.415
Hey!

687
00:55:24.957 --> 00:55:26.333
You know who I am?

688
00:55:27.043 --> 00:55:29.127
I don't want to know who you are.

689
00:55:30.713 --> 00:55:33.090
According to you, 
I'm a sexual pervert.

690
00:55:33.591 --> 00:55:35.384
"An animal," you said.

691
00:55:39.223 --> 00:55:41.015
You know who I am now?

692
00:55:42.976 --> 00:55:44.102
Yes.

693
00:55:46.146 --> 00:55:47.814
Do you feel privileged?

694
00:55:52.027 --> 00:55:53.861
I'm very scared.

695
00:55:57.449 --> 00:55:58.825
Open your eyes.

696
00:56:00.077 --> 00:56:01.994
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.

697
00:56:03.789 --> 00:56:06.457
Your job is to report.
That's why you're here.


698
00:56:06.542 --> 00:56:07.542
And if you don't open your eyes,

699
00:56:07.626 --> 00:56:10.628
I'll staple your eyelids
to your forehead.


700
00:56:17.886 --> 00:56:22.140
Well, here I am.

701
00:56:39.366 --> 00:56:40.908
Look at the screen.

702
00:56:42.202 --> 00:56:44.579
William Blake's <i>The Great Red Dragon</i>

703
00:56:44.663 --> 00:56:46.873
<i>and the Woman Clothed
In The Rays Of The Sun.</i>


704
00:56:46.957 --> 00:56:48.749
- Do you see?
- Yes.


705
00:56:51.044 --> 00:56:52.628
Mrs. Leeds. Do you see?

706
00:56:52.713 --> 00:56:53.713
Yes.

707
00:56:55.132 --> 00:56:57.758
Mrs. Jacobi. Do you see?

708
00:56:58.051 --> 00:56:59.302
Yes.

709
00:57:01.847 --> 00:57:04.640
The next family as they will look
when I go to visit them.


710
00:57:04.725 --> 00:57:06.559
- Do you see?
- Yes.


711
00:57:08.896 --> 00:57:11.898
Mrs. Leeds, later.
Her husband beside her.


712
00:57:13.525 --> 00:57:14.567
Yes.

713
00:57:16.862 --> 00:57:19.447
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.

714
00:57:21.074 --> 00:57:22.783
The Dragon rampant.

715
00:57:26.997 --> 00:57:30.082
Freddie Lounds, your photograph.

716
00:57:31.293 --> 00:57:32.335
No.

717
00:57:32.419 --> 00:57:33.461
No what?

718
00:57:33.545 --> 00:57:35.004
Not me, please.

719
00:57:36.757 --> 00:57:37.715
Please.

720
00:57:37.799 --> 00:57:38.925
Are you a man?

721
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.427
Yes.

722
00:57:41.803 --> 00:57:43.971
Do you imply that I'm queer?

723
00:57:44.515 --> 00:57:45.765
God, no.

724
00:57:47.601 --> 00:57:50.436
Before me, you are
a slug in the sun.

725
00:57:50.521 --> 00:57:53.898
You are privy to a great becoming,
and you recognize nothing.


726
00:57:54.983 --> 00:57:57.109
You are an ant in the afterbirth.

727
00:57:57.736 --> 00:58:00.280
It is your nature
to do one thing correctly,

728
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:01.615
tremble.

729
00:58:02.408 --> 00:58:04.618
But fear is not what you owe me.

730
00:58:04.702 --> 00:58:07.120
No, Lounds, you and the others,

731
00:58:07.205 --> 00:58:09.248
you owe me awe.

732
00:58:16.506 --> 00:58:19.049
We have one more
piece of work to do.

733
00:58:21.052 --> 00:58:23.804
If he takes off the mask,
I am a dead man.


734
00:58:30.103 --> 00:58:31.645
Open your eyes.

735
00:58:34.732 --> 00:58:36.233
Open your eyes!

736
00:58:38.361 --> 00:58:41.655
You will read this
into the tape recorder.


737
00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.907
Go.

738
00:58:44.033 --> 00:58:46.159
"I have had a great privilege.

739
00:58:46.244 --> 00:58:50.414
"I have seen with wonder and awe
the strength of the Red Dragon.


740
00:58:50.498 --> 00:58:52.874
"All I wrote about him were lies.

741
00:58:52.959 --> 00:58:54.918
"Will Graham made me write them

742
00:58:55.003 --> 00:58:58.589
"to pull him into a trap in Washington,
District of Columbia.


743
00:58:58.673 --> 00:59:01.091
"Will Graham, you will learn
from my own lips


744
00:59:01.175 --> 00:59:04.761
"how much you have to dread
because I was forced to lie.


745
00:59:04.846 --> 00:59:08.265
"He will be more merciful to me
than to you.


746
00:59:08.349 --> 00:59:12.644
"You will lie awake in fear
of what the Red Dragon will do.


747
00:59:12.729 --> 00:59:15.772
"I will be a testament
to the truth of this."


748
00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:24.197
You did very well.

749
00:59:26.826 --> 00:59:28.452
Will you let me go now?

750
00:59:28.703 --> 00:59:30.120
Please?

751
00:59:31.247 --> 00:59:33.582
You will tell the truth?

752
00:59:33.666 --> 00:59:34.958
I promise.

753
00:59:37.170 --> 00:59:38.295
Good.

754
00:59:42.967 --> 00:59:45.177
We'll seal your promise with...

755
01:00:06.324 --> 01:00:08.408
We'll seal your promise...

756
01:00:14.248 --> 01:00:15.957
with a kiss.

757
01:00:24.343 --> 01:00:25.718
<i>We'll be showing five possible answers</i>

758
01:00:25.803 --> 01:00:27.303
<i>to the questions I'll be asking.</i>

759
01:00:27.388 --> 01:00:29.263
<i>Any member of a team
may buzz in an answer,</i>


760
01:00:29.348 --> 01:00:32.934
<i>but if incorrect, then the other team
will have the opportunity...</i>


761
01:01:15.018 --> 01:01:20.356
Bowman, just skip the cryptography
and tell me what the hell it says, okay?


762
01:01:21.692 --> 01:01:23.317
Did he try to say anything at all?

763
01:01:23.402 --> 01:01:24.819
No, he sure didn't.

764
01:01:30.325 --> 01:01:31.367
He never regained consciousness.

765
01:01:31.452 --> 01:01:32.452
Did you hear the tape?

766
01:01:32.536 --> 01:01:33.536
Yeah.

767
01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:37.665
Listen, Bowman just broke the code
that Lecktor used in the <i>Tattler</i> personal ad.


768
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:39.417
It was the State of Maryland statutes.

769
01:01:39.501 --> 01:01:41.294
You need to know
what it said right now.

770
01:01:41.378 --> 01:01:42.378
What?

771
01:01:42.463 --> 01:01:43.629
Listen to me.

772
01:01:43.714 --> 01:01:46.758
Everything is okay.
I've taken care of it.


773
01:01:48.594 --> 01:01:50.011
What is it, Jack?

774
01:01:50.804 --> 01:01:53.264
The bastard gave him your home address.

775
01:01:53.557 --> 01:01:56.267
It said, "Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway,

776
01:01:56.351 --> 01:01:57.769
"Captiva, Florida.

777
01:01:59.146 --> 01:02:00.980
"Save yourself. 
Kill them all."

778
01:02:01.064 --> 01:02:02.064
Get me a plane.

779
01:02:02.149 --> 01:02:03.191
Will!

780
01:02:07.654 --> 01:02:08.696
Mom.

781
01:02:12.367 --> 01:02:13.451
What time-
- What?

782
01:02:13.535 --> 01:02:15.328
Someone's outside.

783
01:02:15.746 --> 01:02:16.871
There are noises.

784
01:02:16.955 --> 01:02:18.581
- Where?
- Outside.


785
01:02:31.887 --> 01:02:32.845
Mom.

786
01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:34.680
Go back to your room
and close the door.


787
01:02:38.561 --> 01:02:41.021
- Mom.
- Do it now.


788
01:03:28.695 --> 01:03:30.112
Ma'am, are you all right?

789
01:03:30.196 --> 01:03:31.822
What? What is it?

790
01:03:34.659 --> 01:03:37.202
What is it? What's going on?

791
01:03:37.287 --> 01:03:39.037
Ma'am, I think you should come back inside.

792
01:03:39.122 --> 01:03:40.789
- What's going on?
- Come back inside.


793
01:03:40.874 --> 01:03:43.834
Please. I think you should come back inside.

794
01:04:27.128 --> 01:04:28.503
I'm sorry, Molly.

795
01:04:29.505 --> 01:04:31.340
I'm sorry about all of this.

796
01:04:35.345 --> 01:04:37.971
This place is fine. 
We'll be fine.

797
01:04:39.807 --> 01:04:41.683
He's after you now, isn't he?

798
01:04:41.768 --> 01:04:43.018
This is just a precaution.

799
01:04:44.729 --> 01:04:46.772
Kevin, why don't you
run down to the water,

800
01:04:46.856 --> 01:04:48.482
check out the dock?

801
01:04:48.566 --> 01:04:50.275
I want to hang around here.

802
01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:51.568
I'm in the kitchen, Mom.

803
01:04:51.653 --> 01:04:52.861
Okay.

804
01:04:55.907 --> 01:04:57.366
What is that about?

805
01:04:59.244 --> 01:05:02.622
What, he's afraid to leave you alone
with me now?


806
01:05:03.123 --> 01:05:05.291
He saw the article in the <i>Tattler,</i> right?

807
01:05:05.376 --> 01:05:06.668
I wanted to talk with him about it,

808
01:05:06.752 --> 01:05:10.296
but he said he wanted to bring it up
to you, face to face.


809
01:05:10.381 --> 01:05:11.965
Good for him.

810
01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:14.133
Kevin, help me unpack, will you?

811
01:05:14.218 --> 01:05:16.094
Then we'll go get some groceries.

812
01:05:27.606 --> 01:05:29.899
You and Mom are very well-protected, you know.

813
01:05:29.984 --> 01:05:32.402
No one's gonna find out where you are.

814
01:05:32.486 --> 01:05:35.321
Is there anything I need to know
to see about Mom?


815
01:05:36.031 --> 01:05:37.073
No.

816
01:05:37.741 --> 01:05:40.034
This guy is trying to kill us?

817
01:05:40.452 --> 01:05:42.245
We don't know that.

818
01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:45.039
When are you going to kill him?

819
01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.670
I'm not.

820
01:05:51.088 --> 01:05:52.964
It's only my job to find him.

821
01:05:56.677 --> 01:05:58.678
Barry's mom had this newspaper.

822
01:05:58.846 --> 01:06:01.264
It said you were in a special hospital.

823
01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:06.561
Well, it was a regular hospital,

824
01:06:06.937 --> 01:06:10.273
then I was transferred
into the psychiatric wing.


825
01:06:11.275 --> 01:06:13.651
That bothers you, doesn't it?

826
01:06:14.445 --> 01:06:16.112
I don't know.

827
01:06:16.947 --> 01:06:20.324
Was it because in the papers it said
it was this man Lecktor?


828
01:06:22.786 --> 01:06:24.412
What happened?

829
01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:29.459
Well, Lecktor was attacking college girls,
then he killed them.


830
01:06:30.586 --> 01:06:32.045
How?

831
01:06:33.839 --> 01:06:35.548
In bad ways.

832
01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:39.802
He was a psychiatrist.

833
01:06:40.471 --> 01:06:42.388
One of the girls was his patient,

834
01:06:42.473 --> 01:06:44.390
and I went to
talk to him about her.

835
01:06:47.394 --> 01:06:51.397
I tried to build feelings in my imagination
like the killer had,


836
01:06:51.482 --> 01:06:54.192
so that I would know
why he did what he did,


837
01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:56.694
because that would help me find him.

838
01:06:57.613 --> 01:06:59.739
When I was sitting in Lecktor's office

839
01:06:59.823 --> 01:07:02.492
and I looked up,
I saw a book on his shelf.


840
01:07:02.576 --> 01:07:04.786
It had pictures of war wounds in it.

841
01:07:05.913 --> 01:07:07.622
And I knew it was him.

842
01:07:09.208 --> 01:07:12.835
So I went to a pay phone down the hall
to call the police


843
01:07:13.921 --> 01:07:16.172
and that's when he attacked me.

844
01:07:20.678 --> 01:07:23.472
You and Mom came to
see me in the hospital,

845
01:07:23.556 --> 01:07:25.182
and that helped a lot.

846
01:07:26.684 --> 01:07:29.186
But after my body got okay,

847
01:07:30.021 --> 01:07:33.357
I still had his thoughts
going around in my head.


848
01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:37.694
And I stopped talking to people.

849
01:07:40.657 --> 01:07:44.493
And a doctor friend of mine, a Dr. Bloom,
asked me to get some help.


850
01:07:44.953 --> 01:07:46.203
And I did.

851
01:07:46.913 --> 01:07:50.541
Then after a while I felt better,
and I was okay again.


852
01:07:54.879 --> 01:07:57.631
And the way he thought felt that bad?

853
01:07:58.925 --> 01:08:00.676
Kevin...

854
01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.054
they're the ugliest thoughts in the world.

855
01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:22.072
So, what kind of coffee do you like?

856
01:08:25.243 --> 01:08:27.578
You like that Folgers stuff, right?

857
01:08:28.204 --> 01:08:29.288
Yeah.

858
01:08:30.707 --> 01:08:32.249
Mom likes that, too.

859
01:08:36.296 --> 01:08:38.338
When can we go home, Dad?

860
01:08:40.508 --> 01:08:42.050
I don't know, Kevin.

861
01:08:58.026 --> 01:08:59.776
So, where are things?

862
01:09:01.070 --> 01:09:02.487
Nowhere.

863
01:09:04.574 --> 01:09:08.243
Everything we've tried
is either a dead end or it's backfired.


864
01:09:08.328 --> 01:09:12.331
Crawford's already planning the next crime scene
so they can get it fresh.


865
01:09:14.751 --> 01:09:18.212
We've got about six more days
till the next full moon.


866
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:20.130
Can you quit?

867
01:09:20.882 --> 01:09:22.174
No.

868
01:09:26.262 --> 01:09:27.679
What's next?

869
01:09:30.183 --> 01:09:31.808
I go to Atlanta.

870
01:09:31.893 --> 01:09:33.518
Crawford?

871
01:09:33.603 --> 01:09:34.811
No.

872
01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:40.985
I have to be alone.

873
01:09:45.366 --> 01:09:47.075
You're talking about doing
exactly what you said you--


874
01:09:47.159 --> 01:09:50.328
This killing, it's gotta stop.

875
01:10:19.066 --> 01:10:23.111
William, you're gonna make yourself sick.
Or get yourself killed.


876
01:10:32.913 --> 01:10:35.081
You and Kevin should go to Montana.

877
01:10:36.375 --> 01:10:37.625
See your dad.

878
01:10:37.710 --> 01:10:39.669
He hasn't seen Kevin for a long time.

879
01:10:41.755 --> 01:10:44.507
And I'll come up and get you afterwards.

880
01:11:13.245 --> 01:11:15.330
<i>Hi, this is Valerie Leeds.</i>

881
01:11:15.414 --> 01:11:19.167
<i>Sorry I can't come
to the phone right now.</i>

882
01:11:20.627 --> 01:11:21.711
I'm sorry, too.

883
01:11:21.795 --> 01:11:22.879
Excuse me.

884
01:11:24.298 --> 01:11:25.548
Coffee.

885
01:11:35.309 --> 01:11:37.685
It's just you and me now, sport.

886
01:11:39.646 --> 01:11:42.023
I'm gonna find you, God damn it.

887
01:12:02.504 --> 01:12:03.504
Mr. Dollarhyde?

888
01:12:03.588 --> 01:12:04.713
Eileen.

889
01:12:04.798 --> 01:12:07.049
Bill told me to tell you
there was a variation


890
01:12:07.133 --> 01:12:09.259
in the gamma of number three.

891
01:12:09.677 --> 01:12:11.720
But he caught it in time.

892
01:12:15.642 --> 01:12:16.642
Eileen...

893
01:12:18.061 --> 01:12:20.062
Good. Good.

894
01:13:15.493 --> 01:13:16.452
Who's there?

895
01:13:16.536 --> 01:13:17.578
Mr. Dollarhyde.

896
01:13:17.662 --> 01:13:19.872
I came about the low-light infrared emulsion.

897
01:13:19.956 --> 01:13:21.999
Oh, yeah. Come on in, it's safe.

898
01:13:30.675 --> 01:13:31.758
Put your back against the door.

899
01:13:31.843 --> 01:13:34.178
There's a stool just to your right.

900
01:13:34.262 --> 01:13:37.556
You're the production controller
from Admin, right?


901
01:13:38.057 --> 01:13:41.310
Can you give me
an idea of the conditions?

902
01:13:41.394 --> 01:13:43.979
Shooting from maybe eight feet.

903
01:13:44.063 --> 01:13:45.772
I can't use any lights.

904
01:13:45.857 --> 01:13:47.900
Okay, what's being photographed?

905
01:13:49.027 --> 01:13:51.153
The activities of nocturnal animals.

906
01:13:51.237 --> 01:13:53.030
When do you need it?

907
01:13:53.114 --> 01:13:54.156
Four days.

908
01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.742
Okay, let me stick
this in the black hole.

909
01:14:02.499 --> 01:14:06.043
1000-C infrared sensitive
has to be handled in total darkness.


910
01:14:06.127 --> 01:14:08.212
Remember to be very careful with it.

911
01:14:08.296 --> 01:14:11.715
But still, it's easier to handle
than the 1200 series.


912
01:14:11.799 --> 01:14:13.717
- It'll be fine.
- In case you're wondering,


913
01:14:13.801 --> 01:14:16.303
I keep the samples straight by touch code.

914
01:14:17.056 --> 01:14:19.766
No, I wasn't wondering.

915
01:14:20.351 --> 01:14:23.394
Reba, I gotta fly.
Maybe Mr. Dollarhyde can drive you home tonight.


916
01:14:23.479 --> 01:14:24.771
No, that's okay.
I'll take care of myself.


917
01:14:24.855 --> 01:14:25.897
I can change things around.

918
01:14:25.981 --> 01:14:27.023
No, thanks, go on.

919
01:14:27.107 --> 01:14:28.107
Okay.

920
01:14:33.322 --> 01:14:34.614
I'll take you.

921
01:14:34.782 --> 01:14:38.201
No, thanks. I'll order you 1200 feet
of 1000-C in the morning.


922
01:14:39.537 --> 01:14:40.537
Ride with me.

923
01:14:40.621 --> 01:14:43.873
Thanks, but I'll take the bus.
I do it all the time.


924
01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:45.667
Ride with me.

925
01:14:45.751 --> 01:14:47.544
It would be because
I would like you to.


926
01:14:50.047 --> 01:14:52.799
Okay, sure. Let me get my stuff on.

927
01:14:54.885 --> 01:14:57.053
How did you come to Gateway?

928
01:14:57.137 --> 01:14:58.846
Oh, they had to hire the handicapped

929
01:14:58.931 --> 01:15:03.142
to shape up their employment practices
to get this defense contract.


930
01:15:03.727 --> 01:15:05.061
You worked out well.

931
01:15:05.145 --> 01:15:06.980
Everybody they hired did.

932
01:15:08.649 --> 01:15:10.692
You know, you speak very well.

933
01:15:10.776 --> 01:15:13.194
Although you avoid fricatives and sibilants.

934
01:15:13.279 --> 01:15:14.737
At the Riker Institute for the Blind,

935
01:15:14.822 --> 01:15:18.741
I trained in therapy
for speech- and hearing-impaired children.


936
01:15:19.493 --> 01:15:21.703
I'll probably go back to it someday.

937
01:15:24.164 --> 01:15:26.249
You know, if you don't want to talk,
that's okay.


938
01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:28.918
But I hope you will, because
you're very direct, and I like that,


939
01:15:29.003 --> 01:15:31.337
and I like what you have to say.

940
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:34.507
May I touch your face?

941
01:15:35.843 --> 01:15:38.595
I want to know whether
you're smiling or frowning.


942
01:15:38.679 --> 01:15:41.848
I guess I want to know whether
I should be quiet or not.


943
01:15:48.689 --> 01:15:50.523
Take my word for it.

944
01:15:50.983 --> 01:15:52.233
I'm smiling.

945
01:15:52.776 --> 01:15:54.986
I didn't mean to offend you.

946
01:15:56.488 --> 01:15:58.197
On the way, can I take you somewhere?

947
01:15:58.282 --> 01:15:59.365
Where?

948
01:16:00.743 --> 01:16:02.744
It would be my surprise.

949
01:16:04.079 --> 01:16:05.622
Okay, sure.

950
01:16:22.014 --> 01:16:22.972
Are you apprehensive?

951
01:16:23.057 --> 01:16:24.057
No.

952
01:16:24.683 --> 01:16:27.644
The very protective Mr. Dollarhyde
over there is watching us.


953
01:16:27.728 --> 01:16:29.395
No, no, I want to.

954
01:16:30.230 --> 01:16:33.399
In about two hours we're going
to cap his tooth.


955
01:17:31.918 --> 01:17:33.043
Yeah.

956
01:17:34.295 --> 01:17:35.921
It's warm.

957
01:17:50.603 --> 01:17:52.980
Back a little bit. There.

958
01:17:54.983 --> 01:17:56.024
You hear it?

959
01:17:56.109 --> 01:17:57.109
Yeah.

960
01:18:24.512 --> 01:18:26.180
You...

961
01:18:26.556 --> 01:18:30.100
rearrange the dead families
into an audience to see what you do.


962
01:18:32.061 --> 01:18:36.356
You think that what you do
will make you into something different.


963
01:18:36.441 --> 01:18:37.816
You are becoming.

964
01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.863
What is it you think you're becoming?

965
01:18:45.867 --> 01:18:48.911
The answer is in the way
you use the mirrors.


966
01:18:54.209 --> 01:18:57.086
What do the mirrors
make you dream you're becoming?


967
01:19:31.205 --> 01:19:33.081
A little to your left.

968
01:19:40.756 --> 01:19:42.090
Francis, that was a great dinner.

969
01:19:42.174 --> 01:19:43.675
Thank you.

970
01:19:45.219 --> 01:19:46.845
I made you a gin and tonic.

971
01:19:46.929 --> 01:19:48.680
It's right in front of you.

972
01:19:51.016 --> 01:19:52.934
What are you watching?

973
01:19:54.812 --> 01:19:56.980
It's just a little homework.

974
01:21:27.697 --> 01:21:30.199
You're a sweet, thoughtful man, D.

975
01:21:42.337 --> 01:21:44.797
<i>Is there a fire in the sky?</i>

976
01:21:45.256 --> 01:21:46.799
Your heart's loud.

977
01:21:46.883 --> 01:21:49.176
<i>Is there a moon up there?</i>

978
01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:51.220
If you'll hold me.

979
01:21:51.304 --> 01:21:53.847
<i>Is anything alive now?</i>

980
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:57.851
<i>This darkness is what I hear</i>

981
01:21:59.896 --> 01:22:03.399
<i>This is a breathless silence</i>

982
01:22:04.234 --> 01:22:06.735
<i>A moment out of time</i>

983
01:22:08.613 --> 01:22:11.323
<i>I see your face in the shadows</i>

984
01:22:11.408 --> 01:22:15.911
<i>The tell-tale signs are in your eyes</i>

985
01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:19.748
<i>Aching with a passion inside</i>

986
01:22:22.585 --> 01:22:24.670
<i>Deep as the river</i>

987
01:22:24.754 --> 01:22:27.756
<i>All desire</i>

988
01:22:28.633 --> 01:22:31.760
<i>The ashes and the fire</i>

989
01:22:31.845 --> 01:22:35.097
<i>Turning this night inside</i>

990
01:22:36.266 --> 01:22:38.475
<i>And the light from you</i>

991
01:22:56.786 --> 01:22:59.580
<i>Is there a flame in the dark?</i>

992
01:23:01.124 --> 01:23:03.584
<i>Is there a bright heart star?</i>

993
01:23:05.587 --> 01:23:08.630
<i>These creatures look the same now</i>

994
01:23:09.132 --> 01:23:12.301
<i>We freeze wherever we are</i>

995
01:23:14.345 --> 01:23:18.307
<i>We wake alone in the blackness</i>

996
01:23:18.808 --> 01:23:21.477
<i>We sleep wherever we fall</i>

997
01:23:22.312 --> 01:23:26.065
<i>One dream all around us</i>

998
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:29.651
<i>This big hush infects us all</i>

999
01:23:32.489 --> 01:23:34.823
<i>Forever in this half-light</i>

1000
01:23:34.908 --> 01:23:38.620
<i>All desire</i>

1001
01:23:38.704 --> 01:23:41.915
<i>The ashes and the fire</i>

1002
01:23:41.999 --> 01:23:45.335
<i>Turning this night inside</i>

1003
01:23:47.421 --> 01:23:49.339
<i>And the light from you</i>

1004
01:23:52.468 --> 01:23:55.178
<i>All desire</i>

1005
01:23:56.013 --> 01:23:59.474
<i>The ashes and the fire</i>

1006
01:23:59.558 --> 01:24:03.061
<i>Turning this night inside</i>

1007
01:24:04.063 --> 01:24:06.314
<i>And the light from you</i>

1008
01:24:28.838 --> 01:24:30.547
- Is that you, D?
- Are you okay?


1009
01:24:30.631 --> 01:24:31.965
Yeah, I'm fine.

1010
01:24:34.301 --> 01:24:35.385
Hi.

1011
01:24:36.595 --> 01:24:38.221
- Good morning.
- Morning.


1012
01:24:41.642 --> 01:24:43.852
You know, if you show me where things are,
I'll make us some coffee.


1013
01:24:43.936 --> 01:24:45.019
No, no...

1014
01:24:46.897 --> 01:24:48.398
Don't go back inside the house.

1015
01:24:48.482 --> 01:24:50.316
Why? I left my purse inside.

1016
01:24:51.527 --> 01:24:53.111
I'll get it. It's okay.

1017
01:25:00.119 --> 01:25:03.454
I mean, you should stay outside,
it's-- It's...


1018
01:25:04.665 --> 01:25:07.458
It's 'cause you look
so good in the sun.

1019
01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:09.669
Okay.

1020
01:25:18.345 --> 01:25:20.096
When...

1021
01:25:23.392 --> 01:25:25.727
Reba, when can I see you again?

1022
01:25:30.608 --> 01:25:32.650
We could meet at my house.

1023
01:25:46.290 --> 01:25:47.832
<i>You got the message Lecktor called?</i>

1024
01:25:47.917 --> 01:25:49.500
Yeah. I arranged for
him to have a phone.

1025
01:25:49.585 --> 01:25:50.627
I gotta call him in a few minutes.

1026
01:25:50.711 --> 01:25:53.171
<i>Good. Listen, we identified
the tire tracks left</i>


1027
01:25:53.255 --> 01:25:55.633
<i>when Lounds was delivered
back to the</i> Tattler.


1028
01:25:55.717 --> 01:25:58.135
<i>G-7816 Goodyear truck tires.</i>

1029
01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:00.304
<i>Looks like our boy drives a van.</i>

1030
01:26:00.388 --> 01:26:02.264
<i>I'm setting up our base in Chicago.</i>

1031
01:26:02.349 --> 01:26:03.474
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

1032
01:26:03.558 --> 01:26:05.351
When I'm done, Jack.

1033
01:26:21.868 --> 01:26:23.577
Yeah, this is Will Graham of the FBI.

1034
01:26:23.662 --> 01:26:26.956
Dr. Chilton arranged for me
to talk to Dr. Lecktor.


1035
01:26:31.503 --> 01:26:32.503
Hello?

1036
01:26:34.965 --> 01:26:36.173
<i>Hello, Will.</i>

1037
01:26:36.925 --> 01:26:39.510
<i>I wanted to congratulate you
for the job you did on Mr. Lounds.</i>


1038
01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:41.553
I admire that enormously.

1039
01:26:41.638 --> 01:26:43.806
Oh, what a cunning boy you are.

1040
01:26:44.516 --> 01:26:46.267
I'm sick of you crazy sons of bitches.

1041
01:26:46.351 --> 01:26:48.310
You got something to say, say it.

1042
01:26:48.395 --> 01:26:49.853
<i>I want to help you.</i>

1043
01:26:50.855 --> 01:26:53.107
<i>You'd be more comfortable
if you relax with yourself.</i>


1044
01:26:53.191 --> 01:26:55.401
<i>We don't invent our natures,
they're issued to us,</i>


1045
01:26:55.485 --> 01:26:58.779
<i>along with our lungs and pancreas
and everything else.</i>


1046
01:26:59.572 --> 01:27:01.031
<i>Why fight it?</i>

1047
01:27:02.033 --> 01:27:03.284
Fight what?

1048
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:05.119
<i>Did you really feel so depressed</i>

1049
01:27:05.203 --> 01:27:08.580
<i>after you shot
Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death?</i>


1050
01:27:08.999 --> 01:27:12.418
<i>I didn't know you then,
but I think you probably did.</i>


1051
01:27:12.502 --> 01:27:15.004
But it wasn't the act
that got you down, was it?


1052
01:27:15.088 --> 01:27:18.007
Didn't you really feel so bad
because killing him felt so good?


1053
01:27:18.091 --> 01:27:20.092
And why shouldn't it feel good?

1054
01:27:20.885 --> 01:27:24.305
<i>It must feel good to God.
He does it all the time.</i>


1055
01:27:25.557 --> 01:27:26.974
God's terrific.

1056
01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:29.810
He dropped a church roof
on 34 of his worshippers


1057
01:27:29.894 --> 01:27:31.478
last Wednesday night in Texas

1058
01:27:31.563 --> 01:27:34.690
as they were groveling
through a hymn to his majesty.


1059
01:27:35.066 --> 01:27:37.318
<i>Don't you think that felt good?</i>

1060
01:27:41.406 --> 01:27:43.574
Why does it feel good, Dr. Lecktor?

1061
01:27:44.701 --> 01:27:47.953
It feels good, Will,
because God has power.


1062
01:27:49.247 --> 01:27:52.458
And if one does
what God does enough times,

1063
01:27:52.792 --> 01:27:56.086
<i>one will become as God is.</i>

1064
01:28:00.759 --> 01:28:04.094
<i>God's a champ. 
He always stays ahead.</i>

1065
01:28:04.596 --> 01:28:08.432
<i>He got 140 Filipinos
in one plane crash last month.</i>


1066
01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:11.435
<i>Remember that earthquake
in Italy last spring?</i>


1067
01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:16.358
<i>I enter.</i>

1068
01:28:20.279 --> 01:28:22.155
<i>The glass cutter.</i>

1069
01:28:22.239 --> 01:28:24.866
<i>The piece of glass
I take out is mine.</i>

1070
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:26.618
<i>The house is mine.</i>

1071
01:28:36.045 --> 01:28:37.921
<i>I walk up these stairs,</i>

1072
01:28:38.964 --> 01:28:40.840
<i>I pass the children's toys.</i>

1073
01:28:42.009 --> 01:28:44.052
<i>The children mean nothing to me.</i>

1074
01:28:44.970 --> 01:28:46.930
<i>They were put here to help me.</i>

1075
01:28:51.143 --> 01:28:52.852
<i>I move to the door.</i>

1076
01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:58.983
<i>I step into the room.</i>

1077
01:29:03.531 --> 01:29:05.156
I see you there.

1078
01:29:08.661 --> 01:29:10.954
And I see me desired by you.

1079
01:29:13.499 --> 01:29:17.544
Accepted and loved...

1080
01:29:18.587 --> 01:29:21.589
in the silver mirrors...

1081
01:29:22.508 --> 01:29:24.008
of your eyes.

1082
01:30:01.547 --> 01:30:07.260
<i>Father, look in my eyes</i>

1083
01:30:07.553 --> 01:30:14.392
<i>See me as I really am</i>

1084
01:30:15.394 --> 01:30:18.396
<i>You made me</i>

1085
01:30:18.481 --> 01:30:21.774
<i>Now take me</i>

1086
01:30:21.859 --> 01:30:24.277
I'm gonna talk to Fogel tomorrow...

1087
01:30:25.613 --> 01:30:30.825
<i>Tell me how it feels now</i>

1088
01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:37.875
<i>Behold your flesh has come of age</i>

1089
01:30:39.127 --> 01:30:40.628
Wait a minute.

1090
01:30:40.712 --> 01:30:47.635
<i>Forsake me, you break me</i>

1091
01:30:50.013 --> 01:30:52.306
<i>Strong as I am</i>

1092
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:56.018
<i>There's something about this thing
that scares me</i>


1093
01:30:56.102 --> 01:30:58.479
<i>Strong as I am</i>

1094
01:30:58.563 --> 01:31:01.857
<i>There's something about this thing
that dares me</i>


1095
01:31:01.942 --> 01:31:04.443
<i>Strong as I am</i>

1096
01:31:04.528 --> 01:31:07.988
<i>There's something about this thing
that haunts me</i>


1097
01:31:08.073 --> 01:31:10.366
<i>Strong as I am</i>

1098
01:31:10.450 --> 01:31:17.331
<i>There's something about this thing
that taunts me</i>


1099
01:31:19.793 --> 01:31:24.129
<i>Mother, let me heal you</i>

1100
01:31:24.923 --> 01:31:31.845
<i>Your pain has lasted far too long</i>

1101
01:31:33.807 --> 01:31:39.853
<i>Release it, it kills you</i>

1102
01:31:41.690 --> 01:31:43.357
What was it?

1103
01:31:43.441 --> 01:31:44.442
Pollen.

1104
01:31:45.026 --> 01:31:46.402
- Thanks for the ride.
- See you tomorrow.


1105
01:31:46.486 --> 01:31:47.486
Yeah.

1106
01:31:49.197 --> 01:31:55.452
<i>The love you would not share
grows tired of waiting</i>


1107
01:31:57.289 --> 01:31:58.539
Mr. Dollarhyde.

1108
01:31:59.207 --> 01:32:00.874
What are you doing here?

1109
01:32:08.174 --> 01:32:10.467
<i>Strong as I am</i>

1110
01:32:10.552 --> 01:32:14.263
<i>There's something about this thing
that scares me</i>


1111
01:32:14.347 --> 01:32:16.515
<i>Strong as I am</i>

1112
01:32:18.893 --> 01:32:20.311
Who is it?

1113
01:32:20.395 --> 01:32:21.604
It's me.

1114
01:32:22.397 --> 01:32:24.023
Who? Who is it?

1115
01:32:24.107 --> 01:32:25.107
It's me.

1116
01:32:27.402 --> 01:32:29.320
- Francis?
- No...


1117
01:32:30.780 --> 01:32:32.364
not Francis.

1118
01:32:34.159 --> 01:32:35.576
Francis is gone.

1119
01:32:37.203 --> 01:32:39.538
Francis is gone forever.

1120
01:32:49.049 --> 01:32:50.633
So, what are we doing?

1121
01:32:51.468 --> 01:32:52.718
The dream.

1122
01:32:54.387 --> 01:32:57.098
He dreams about being wanted and desired,

1123
01:32:57.558 --> 01:33:01.144
so he changes people into beings
who want and desire him.


1124
01:33:01.812 --> 01:33:02.854
Changes?

1125
01:33:02.938 --> 01:33:04.397
It's a word.

1126
01:33:04.899 --> 01:33:07.901
Killing and arranging the people
to imitate it.


1127
01:33:09.612 --> 01:33:11.863
And Lecktor told me something.

1128
01:33:11.947 --> 01:33:14.449
If one does what God does enough times,

1129
01:33:14.533 --> 01:33:16.576
one will become as God is.

1130
01:33:17.411 --> 01:33:19.204
You put it together, you get,

1131
01:33:19.288 --> 01:33:23.833
if our boy imitates being wanted
and desired enough times,


1132
01:33:23.918 --> 01:33:25.794
he believes he will become one

1133
01:33:25.878 --> 01:33:28.254
who is wanted and desired and accepted.

1134
01:33:28.756 --> 01:33:30.590
It'll all come true.

1135
01:33:31.092 --> 01:33:34.010
This started from an abused kid,

1136
01:33:34.261 --> 01:33:35.970
a battered infant.

1137
01:33:37.473 --> 01:33:40.016
There's something terrible about--

1138
01:33:40.142 --> 01:33:42.769
What, are you sympathizing
with this guy now?


1139
01:33:44.772 --> 01:33:46.523
Absolutely.

1140
01:33:46.607 --> 01:33:48.316
My heart bleeds for him as a child.

1141
01:33:48.818 --> 01:33:51.444
Someone took a kid and manufactured a monster.

1142
01:33:51.612 --> 01:33:54.948
At the same time, as an adult,
he's irredeemable.


1143
01:33:55.658 --> 01:33:58.535
He butchers whole families
to pursue trivial fantasies.


1144
01:33:58.619 --> 01:34:02.664
As an adult, someone should blow
this sick fuck out of his socks.


1145
01:34:07.294 --> 01:34:10.130
Do you think that's a contradiction, Jack?

1146
01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:14.843
Does this kind of understanding
make you uncomfortable?


1147
01:34:27.857 --> 01:34:29.649
What about the mirrors?

1148
01:34:32.027 --> 01:34:34.654
He uses the mirrors to see it happen.

1149
01:34:36.657 --> 01:34:38.908
But he doesn't take anything.

1150
01:34:39.952 --> 01:34:41.578
There's no souvenirs taken from the houses.

1151
01:34:41.662 --> 01:34:44.706
He needs souvenirs or trophies
to re-live the event.


1152
01:34:49.086 --> 01:34:51.254
Maybe he records it somehow.

1153
01:34:52.506 --> 01:34:56.384
So he could see himself accepted
over and over and over again.


1154
01:34:59.847 --> 01:35:02.432
VTRs, Polaroids, stills, what?

1155
01:35:02.516 --> 01:35:03.975
How do I know?

1156
01:35:06.479 --> 01:35:08.271
How does he find them?

1157
01:35:09.815 --> 01:35:12.150
When we find out how he found them,
we'll find him.


1158
01:35:12.234 --> 01:35:14.695
There is no connection
between the two families.


1159
01:35:14.780 --> 01:35:16.447
We've done a dozen computer runs.

1160
01:35:16.531 --> 01:35:18.908
Jack, all the women
have a bloom on them.

1161
01:35:18.992 --> 01:35:21.327
He didn't win them in a lottery,
he picked these women.


1162
01:35:21.411 --> 01:35:23.829
There's selection and design in his choices.

1163
01:35:23.914 --> 01:35:26.582
Look, admit we struck out this month.

1164
01:35:26.666 --> 01:35:29.543
The Lear Jet is standing by,
the basic lab stuff is on it.


1165
01:35:29.628 --> 01:35:32.004
You, Zeller, Jimmy Price, the photographer,

1166
01:35:32.088 --> 01:35:34.673
anywhere he hits,
we can be there in an hour and 15 minutes.


1167
01:35:34.758 --> 01:35:37.802
We get the call, we roll.
The scene will be fresher than we've ever had it.


1168
01:35:37.886 --> 01:35:39.345
- It's not over yet.
- For Christ's sake!


1169
01:35:39.429 --> 01:35:41.430
That's a foregone conclusion.

1170
01:35:41.515 --> 01:35:44.558
It's 11:30 p.m.,
the full moon is happening tonight.


1171
01:35:44.893 --> 01:35:47.394
Give it up!
Forget this month, it's too damn late!


1172
01:35:47.479 --> 01:35:48.979
I gave it up.

1173
01:35:49.064 --> 01:35:51.148
Till you showed up
with pictures of two dead families,


1174
01:35:51.233 --> 01:35:54.693
knowing goddamn well that I'd imagine
families three, four, five and six. Right?


1175
01:35:54.778 --> 01:35:56.654
You're fucking right I did,
and I'd do it again!


1176
01:35:56.738 --> 01:35:58.823
Great! But don't talk
to me about late, pal,

1177
01:35:58.907 --> 01:36:00.825
I'll tell you when it's too fucking late!

1178
01:36:00.909 --> 01:36:03.869
Until then, we go as late
as I want to take it!


1179
01:36:22.597 --> 01:36:24.056
A padlock.

1180
01:36:30.438 --> 01:36:32.356
That's why the bolt cutter.

1181
01:36:32.983 --> 01:36:34.316
What's that?

1182
01:36:34.442 --> 01:36:36.026
He used a bolt cutter
to trim away the branch


1183
01:36:36.111 --> 01:36:37.778
when he was watching from the woods.

1184
01:36:37.863 --> 01:36:40.030
Why didn't he use the bolt cutter
on the garage door?


1185
01:36:40.115 --> 01:36:43.409
Because a deadbolt was there
when they were killed.


1186
01:36:46.955 --> 01:36:50.291
Donald Jacobi's 12th birthday party
was April 14th.


1187
01:36:50.792 --> 01:36:53.878
Sometime between April 14th and August 1
they changed the lock.


1188
01:36:53.962 --> 01:36:56.422
But he thought there was a padlock there.

1189
01:37:04.097 --> 01:37:07.975
From the street, you can't see the glass
in the Leeds' kitchen door.


1190
01:37:08.059 --> 01:37:09.810
There's a big, high fence there.

1191
01:37:09.895 --> 01:37:12.479
But he was ready with his glass cutter.

1192
01:37:14.316 --> 01:37:17.318
So either he was casing far ahead

1193
01:37:18.153 --> 01:37:21.322
and we didn't check back far enough,

1194
01:37:23.366 --> 01:37:24.617
or...

1195
01:37:27.162 --> 01:37:28.162
We checked.

1196
01:37:28.246 --> 01:37:29.246
Don't talk.

1197
01:37:32.876 --> 01:37:36.504
Metcalfe, is the Leeds and Jacobi stuff
still in the storeroom?


1198
01:37:37.506 --> 01:37:39.758
Have the guard down there call me.

1199
01:37:39.842 --> 01:37:40.967
Do it.

1200
01:37:49.226 --> 01:37:51.353
You know that's the Jacobis' cat.

1201
01:37:54.398 --> 01:37:58.485
You brought a bolt cutter
'cause you thought there was a padlock.


1202
01:38:00.237 --> 01:38:01.780
The Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar,

1203
01:38:01.864 --> 01:38:05.200
but you know it's the Leeds' dog,
don't you, my man?


1204
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:09.454
See the woman?

1205
01:38:09.914 --> 01:38:11.998
The bloom on the woman?

1206
01:38:13.876 --> 01:38:16.711
You can see her again and again
anytime you want.


1207
01:38:18.506 --> 01:38:19.464
Doggie doesn't have a collar,

1208
01:38:19.548 --> 01:38:21.967
but you know it's the Leeds' dog.

1209
01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:24.386
And the Jacobi cat.

1210
01:38:25.888 --> 01:38:27.722
And the padlock on the door.

1211
01:38:30.726 --> 01:38:34.729
And you know you need a bolt cutter
and every other goddamn thing


1212
01:38:35.606 --> 01:38:38.525
because everything with you
is seeing, isn't it?


1213
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:43.488
Your primary sensory intake

1214
01:38:43.906 --> 01:38:46.449
that makes your dream live is seeing.

1215
01:38:47.618 --> 01:38:50.912
Reflections, mirrors,

1216
01:38:52.206 --> 01:38:54.374
images...

1217
01:39:03.134 --> 01:39:05.176
You've seen these films.

1218
01:39:10.307 --> 01:39:12.017
Haven't you, my man?

1219
01:39:19.650 --> 01:39:20.942
It's the guard in the storeroom.

1220
01:39:21.027 --> 01:39:22.694
- The cans.
- What cans?


1221
01:39:22.778 --> 01:39:24.362
The tapes were transferred from home movies.

1222
01:39:24.447 --> 01:39:26.031
Where's the packaging the films came in?

1223
01:39:26.115 --> 01:39:30.118
There's films of the families
in the document storage. Find them.


1224
01:39:32.538 --> 01:39:33.913
You got them?

1225
01:39:34.081 --> 01:39:35.915
Are there any labels?

1226
01:39:38.502 --> 01:39:41.379
Leeds can, Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.

1227
01:39:41.464 --> 01:39:44.299
The Jacobi label will say the same thing
as the Leeds label.


1228
01:39:44.383 --> 01:39:46.468
Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.

1229
01:39:46.635 --> 01:39:48.511
Who processed the Jacobi film?

1230
01:39:51.599 --> 01:39:54.560
No. Bob's Photo Store, Birmingham.

1231
01:39:54.644 --> 01:39:56.312
Stores send them out.

1232
01:39:56.396 --> 01:39:58.272
Have him peel the top label back.

1233
01:39:58.356 --> 01:40:00.483
Is there a label underneath?

1234
01:40:12.954 --> 01:40:14.789
It does, doesn't it?

1235
01:40:22.005 --> 01:40:25.216
I want a chopper on the roof
in three minutes to Meigs Field.


1236
01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:26.342
At Meigs Field,

1237
01:40:26.426 --> 01:40:29.428
I want the Lear Jet prepped
and a plan filed with St. Louis.


1238
01:41:09.386 --> 01:41:11.303
Where are you? Are you here?

1239
01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:19.145
You're scaring me with this!

1240
01:41:19.646 --> 01:41:21.230
Will you just stop it?

1241
01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:25.568
Francis...

1242
01:41:26.236 --> 01:41:28.362
why are you doing this to me?

1243
01:41:30.282 --> 01:41:31.740
It's ugly!

1244
01:41:32.325 --> 01:41:35.661
<i>Don't you know that I'll always be true?</i>

1245
01:41:36.413 --> 01:41:39.290
Are you in this room?
Where are you?


1246
01:41:40.959 --> 01:41:42.626
You answer me!

1247
01:41:44.462 --> 01:41:46.589
<i>And take my hand</i>

1248
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:52.052
<i>Oh, won't you come with me</i>

1249
01:41:52.596 --> 01:41:58.142
<i>And walk this land</i>

1250
01:41:58.226 --> 01:42:05.107
<i>Please, take my hand</i>

1251
01:42:13.283 --> 01:42:16.036
We're looking for a man.
We know he works at Gateway.


1252
01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:19.247
We don't have his name,
but we know he drives a van.


1253
01:42:19.332 --> 01:42:20.415
<i>Under "Employee Facilities,"</i>

1254
01:42:20.499 --> 01:42:22.375
<i>I've got special stickers for vans.</i>

1255
01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:25.212
<i>Yeah, I got 28, 29 van permits
in the computer.</i>


1256
01:42:25.296 --> 01:42:26.922
Start feeding me names.

1257
01:42:28.299 --> 01:42:30.300
Is this Lieutenant Fisk?

1258
01:42:30.509 --> 01:42:31.801
Will Graham.

1259
01:42:31.969 --> 01:42:33.970
Listen, I need you to punch up
the driver's licenses


1260
01:42:34.055 --> 01:42:35.805
of the names I'm gonna feed you.

1261
01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:38.558
The man we're looking for
is blond, Caucasian,

<i>You guys better buckle up.</i>

1275

<i>We're on approach to Lambert Field.</i>

1276
01:44:01.809 --> 01:44:03.143
Fogel has four more names.

He knows two, both dark hair,

fourth is a handicapped parking permit.

01:44:10.526 --> 01:44:11.901
This is our man.

01:44:14.739 --> 01:44:16.948
Rural Route 3, Chester, Missouri.
Where is that?


1281
01:44:17.241 --> 01:44:18.658
From the airport you're a few minutes closer.

1282
01:44:18.743 --> 01:44:21.995
We'll 10-25 at the Hark Road off ramp,
Highway 94.


1283
01:44:23.289 --> 01:44:24.456
Let's go!

Meet point's up ahead.

1285
01:45:56.842 --> 01:45:57.925
Go on to the house.

1286
01:45:58.009 --> 01:45:59.385
But Lieutenant Fisk said--

1287
01:45:59.469 --> 01:46:01.053
Go on to the house.

1288
01:46:10.522 --> 01:46:11.689
Will?

1289
01:46:13.024 --> 01:46:14.775
You're not gonna need that.

1290
01:46:14.860 --> 01:46:17.611
A SWAT team is gonna
take him down, not us.

1291
01:46:21.741 --> 01:46:22.741
Will?

1292
01:46:26.746 --> 01:46:27.746
Will!

1293
01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:46.807
This ought to be it right here.

1294
01:46:46.892 --> 01:46:48.267
Kill your lights.

1295
01:47:05.745 --> 01:47:06.828
Are you all right?

1296
01:47:06.913 --> 01:47:09.956
I'm okay. Griffin's hurt bad.
I'll wait for the backup.


1297
01:47:12.710 --> 01:47:14.711
Set up a roadblock on Route 3.

1298
01:47:14.962 --> 01:47:17.756
Graham and I are in the trees
west of the house.


1299
01:47:18.925 --> 01:47:20.884
How far away is the backup unit?

1300
01:47:20.968 --> 01:47:23.929
I'm going around the back.
Stay in the trees.


1301
01:48:03.761 --> 01:48:05.262
He's in there, Jack.

1302
01:48:07.348 --> 01:48:10.100
And he's got somebody in there with him.

1303
01:48:30.663 --> 01:48:31.913
What?

1304
01:48:34.625 --> 01:48:36.376
Will, what did you say?

1305
01:48:43.301 --> 01:48:45.927
<i>Will. Wait for the backup, Will.</i>

1306
01:49:02.111 --> 01:49:05.196
He's got somebody in the house
with him, Jack.


1307
01:49:05.489 --> 01:49:06.489
<i>Will.</i>

1308
01:49:11.537 --> 01:49:12.579
Stop it.

1309
01:49:16.627 --> 01:49:18.044
Stop it!

1310
01:50:55.642 --> 01:50:56.767
<i>Three, four...</i>

1311
01:51:04.985 --> 01:51:08.320
<i>In-a-gadda-da-vida, honey</i>

1312
01:51:08.989 --> 01:51:12.324
<i>Don't you know that I love you?</i>

1313
01:51:12.909 --> 01:51:16.078
<i>In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby</i>

1314
01:51:16.163 --> 01:51:20.291
<i>Don't you know that I'll always be true?</i>

1315
01:51:24.755 --> 01:51:28.257
<i>Oh, won't you come with me</i>

1316
01:51:28.592 --> 01:51:32.136
<i>And take my hand</i>

1317
01:51:32.554 --> 01:51:36.183
<i>Oh, won't you come with me</i>

1318
01:51:36.392 --> 01:51:41.438
<i>And walk this land</i>

1319
01:51:41.731 --> 01:51:47.778
<i>Please, take my hand</i>

1320
01:52:54.053 --> 01:52:55.262
It's okay.

1321
01:52:58.891 --> 01:53:00.267
Who are you?

1322
01:53:02.270 --> 01:53:03.311
Graham.

1323
01:53:05.773 --> 01:53:07.274
I'm Will Graham.

1324
01:53:52.236 --> 01:53:58.451
<i>I can hear your heartbeat
knocking on the window</i>


1325
01:53:58.535 --> 01:53:59.577
Hey, Dad!

1326
01:53:59.661 --> 01:54:03.164
<i>I can feel the weight deep down below</i>

1327
01:54:03.916 --> 01:54:05.458
- Dad!
- Hey!


1328
01:54:09.546 --> 01:54:11.547
It looks worse than it is, pal.

1329
01:54:11.715 --> 01:54:12.882
See the turtles?

1330
01:54:22.225 --> 01:54:23.559
Hi.

1331
01:54:24.019 --> 01:54:26.312
It was on the news.

1332
01:54:32.778 --> 01:54:36.489
I thought I had to work things out

1333
01:54:36.573 --> 01:54:38.032
and call you after.

1334
01:54:39.868 --> 01:54:41.577
I thought I wouldn't wait.

1335
01:54:43.622 --> 01:54:49.961
<i>Sometimes I understand it very clearly</i>

1336
01:54:50.045 --> 01:54:55.216
<i>Heartbeat, heartbeat
Listen to my heartbeat</i>


1337
01:54:58.762 --> 01:55:00.471
How many of them made it?

1338
01:55:01.682 --> 01:55:02.890
Most of them.

1339
01:55:04.393 --> 01:55:06.560
Most of them made it.

1340
