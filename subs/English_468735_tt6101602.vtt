00:10:44.129 --> 00:10:48.332
I spent two years
and three months


157
00:10:48.334 --> 00:10:50.701
in a cell by myself.

158
00:10:50.703 --> 00:10:53.370
Your brain...
Your mind is always working.


159
00:10:53.372 --> 00:10:55.706
And it's like, you know,

160
00:10:55.708 --> 00:10:58.409
you have to stimulate it
to keep it going.


161
00:10:58.411 --> 00:11:01.712
I would read
the back of my toothpaste.


162
00:11:01.714 --> 00:11:06.449
Like, the fluoride and, you know,
like, chloride or whatever.


163
00:11:06.451 --> 00:11:08.352
Whatever the percentage.

164
00:11:08.354 --> 00:11:13.126
If you could change one thing
about the past, what would it be?


165
00:11:14.926 --> 00:11:16.095
Um...

166
00:11:18.964 --> 00:11:21.964
my association with people.

167
00:11:21.966 --> 00:11:25.334
Does anyone else have an
experience or a moment of violence


168
00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:28.107
that's happened to them
that they might want to share?


169
00:11:32.411 --> 00:11:36.880
[indistinct chattering] ...to
give you a hug. Would you mind?


170
00:11:36.882 --> 00:11:38.981
- [laughing]
- You're so tall!


171
00:11:38.983 --> 00:11:40.420
Come down here.

172
00:11:53.932 --> 00:11:56.132
Okay, let's do, um...

173
00:11:56.134 --> 00:11:59.970
Let's do an improv based on
the theme of "no way out."


174
00:11:59.972 --> 00:12:03.240
- <i>Okay, we're basing this on Jamal's stories, right?</i>
- [Evangeline] <i>Yes.</i>


175
00:12:03.242 --> 00:12:06.744
- <i>His prison experiences, right?</i>
- <i>An open canvas on the theme of no way out.</i>


176
00:12:06.746 --> 00:12:10.447
[Evangeline] In a simple, single
gesture, crossing the stage.


177
00:12:10.449 --> 00:12:13.516
[actors breathing
rhythmically]


178
00:12:13.518 --> 00:12:16.053
[Evangeline] You want
to jump in, Madeline?


179
00:12:16.055 --> 00:12:19.224
[rhythmic breathing
continues]


180
00:12:33.205 --> 00:12:34.873
[rhythmic breathing stops]

181
00:12:38.944 --> 00:12:41.944
Are we gonna... Are we gonna use his story?
Is it Jamal's?


182
00:12:41.946 --> 00:12:44.847
Is Jamal gonna be the character?
Is he one of the pigs?


183
00:12:44.849 --> 00:12:47.384
Why is prison
relevant to this?


184
00:12:47.386 --> 00:12:50.419
Hey, Evangeline,
can we ask you something?


185
00:12:50.421 --> 00:12:55.458
Is this a metaphor? Are we
using prison as a metaphor?


186
00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.197
So what are we making?

187
00:13:13.912 --> 00:13:16.081
[Evangeline]
<i>This is just a metaphor.</i>


188
00:13:17.315 --> 00:13:18.981
But, so...

189
00:13:18.983 --> 00:13:23.453
I mean, I just really wanted
to stay after rehearsal.


190
00:13:23.455 --> 00:13:27.890
- I'm just bummed I'm not staying after rehearsal.
- Well, do you want to walk home?


191
00:13:27.892 --> 00:13:30.227
No. I wanted to tell
Evangeline something.


192
00:13:30.229 --> 00:13:32.161
And we're always late so I
never get to talk to her.


193
00:13:32.163 --> 00:13:34.497
- It's a five-mile walk back.
- No, I...


194
00:13:34.499 --> 00:13:37.534
- Shit. Fuck it.
- What?


195
00:13:37.536 --> 00:13:40.873
- Go to rehearsal, go to rehearsal, go to rehearsal.
- What?


196
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.041
Okay.

197
00:13:45.243 --> 00:13:47.343
What? What?

198
00:13:47.345 --> 00:13:50.581
- You just... You wanna... You wanna go? Okay.
- Mom...


199
00:13:50.583 --> 00:13:53.082
- I thought we were ordering takeout.
- Mom!


200
00:13:53.084 --> 00:13:55.318
I said
we can go home.


201
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.387
You wanna go, so go.
Get out!


202
00:13:58.389 --> 00:14:00.457
- No! Mom, we can go home.
- Get out!


203
00:14:00.459 --> 00:14:03.427
- Out, out, out, out! I will be waiting here!
- No. No. No.


204
00:14:03.429 --> 00:14:04.497
We can go home.

205
00:14:12.637 --> 00:14:16.906
Mom, what would you be
if you were someone else?


206
00:14:16.908 --> 00:14:20.110
Do you mean,
like, a famous person?


207
00:14:20.112 --> 00:14:22.913
No, he means, um,

208
00:14:22.915 --> 00:14:27.617
if you could cut out someone's
face and wear it as your own,


209
00:14:27.619 --> 00:14:29.154
who would it be?

210
00:14:31.456 --> 00:14:33.991
- You been smoking?
- No.


211
00:14:33.993 --> 00:14:35.992
Oh. Oh.

212
00:14:35.994 --> 00:14:38.197
- You mean...
- What's your answer?


213
00:14:40.065 --> 00:14:41.999
Spring rolls.

214
00:14:42.001 --> 00:14:45.468
- The sky.
- Sky, as in the YouTuber?


215
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.971
The motherfucking sky.

216
00:14:47.973 --> 00:14:49.573
- [mother] Okay. Yeah.
- The sky.


217
00:14:49.575 --> 00:14:51.607
You don't have to
use that word.


218
00:14:51.609 --> 00:14:53.910
- Yeah, Madge.
- W-Well...


219
00:14:53.912 --> 00:14:55.678
Don't call me Madge.

220
00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.016
[boy]
Okay, Madge.


221
00:14:59.184 --> 00:15:04.023
You know what? Call me Madge one more time,
and I'll cut your face out and wear it.


222
00:15:05.224 --> 00:15:07.124
[boy] Well, I would
be Chris Paul.


223
00:15:07.126 --> 00:15:09.358
- You're not gonna eat anything?
- You'd be cutting off Chris Paul's face.


224
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.627
Do you want
some peanut butter toast?


225
00:15:11.629 --> 00:15:14.264
[boy]
Yeah, do you want some toast?


226
00:15:14.266 --> 00:15:17.601
Put some little
peanut butter, Madge?


227
00:15:17.603 --> 00:15:19.970
- [makes chomping noise]
- Asshole.


228
00:15:19.972 --> 00:15:21.704
- I'm gonna cut your face out.
- No, you're not.


229
00:15:21.706 --> 00:15:24.374
- Yes, I am.
- No scissors.


230
00:15:24.376 --> 00:15:27.510
- This is my face.
- You can have my face!


231
00:15:27.512 --> 00:15:30.347
- [mother] <i>I mean, I don't...</i>
- [chattering]


232
00:15:30.349 --> 00:15:33.652
<i>I just wish that I knew
she was safe. You know?</i>


233
00:15:34.719 --> 00:15:36.653
<i>Or that</i> I <i>was safe.</i>

234
00:15:36.655 --> 00:15:40.691
<i>She threw an ashtray at her brother's
forehead. He had to get stitches.</i>


235
00:15:40.693 --> 00:15:43.529
[mother continues,
muffled]


236
00:16:05.684 --> 00:16:09.218
If we move away from the prison
concept we need more rehearsal time.


237
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.755
We can't afford
this space here anymore.


238
00:16:11.757 --> 00:16:14.156
- So, it's a...
- Hey.


239
00:16:14.158 --> 00:16:16.025
- No, I...
- Um, can I...


240
00:16:16.027 --> 00:16:19.328
- Can I talk to you about something?
- Sure.


241
00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.532
Sure.

242
00:16:25.304 --> 00:16:28.541
[actors chattering]

243
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:49.626
I had this dream that I wanted to
tell you about, but, you know...


244
00:16:49.628 --> 00:16:51.229
I know.

245
00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:57.634
You know what they say
about dreaming.


246
00:16:57.636 --> 00:16:59.472
You just have to
trust yourself.


247
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:08.045
Jung says that... [exhales]
in all chaos there is a cosmos,


248
00:17:08.047 --> 00:17:11.114
in all disorder a secret order,

249
00:17:11.116 --> 00:17:14.084
that the pendulum of the mind

250
00:17:14.086 --> 00:17:16.353
swings between sense
and nonsense,


251
00:17:16.355 --> 00:17:18.722
not between right and wrong.

252
00:17:18.724 --> 00:17:20.326
Dreams are awesome.

253
00:17:27.765 --> 00:17:30.702
I dreamt I slammed my
mother's hand with an iron.


254
00:17:33.739 --> 00:17:35.008
I couldn't breathe.

255
00:17:39.845 --> 00:17:42.648
It felt like I was underwater,
watching her.


256
00:17:49.088 --> 00:17:51.624
Anything like that, you can
always share it with me.


257
00:17:56.494 --> 00:17:58.464
I dreamt
you were my daughter.


258
00:18:07.306 --> 00:18:10.043
Do you feel safe
around your mom?


259
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:14.211
[chattering, laughing]

260
00:18:14.213 --> 00:18:17.050
Ladies, let's go. Let's get in here.
Gotta celebrate.


261
00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:21.787
[no audible dialogue]

262
00:18:31.429 --> 00:18:33.430
- Harsh.
- Shut up.


263
00:18:33.432 --> 00:18:35.598
I just have to watch out
for the, um...


264
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.701
- For the cracks?
- Yeah. The, um...


265
00:18:37.703 --> 00:18:40.306
All right. I mean... Stop.
We could race.


266
00:18:42.741 --> 00:18:44.741
Life has
a lot of pain in it.


267
00:18:44.743 --> 00:18:46.443
- [snickering]
- No, I'm serious.


268
00:18:46.445 --> 00:18:48.811
- Uh-huh.
- But, um...


269
00:18:48.813 --> 00:18:51.147
- Like, Socrates said that or something?
- [laughs]


270
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:52.781
- No.
- Uh-huh.


271
00:18:52.783 --> 00:18:55.385
Socrates didn't say it.
Aristotle did.


272
00:18:55.387 --> 00:18:56.856
[laughing]

273
00:18:59.758 --> 00:19:01.561
[both sigh]

274
00:19:04.428 --> 00:19:06.495
You're kind of making
a new dance up.


275
00:19:06.497 --> 00:19:08.531
It's called, like,
the roller blade stutter step.


276
00:19:08.533 --> 00:19:10.700
[both grunting]

277
00:19:10.702 --> 00:19:12.935
[laughs]

278
00:19:12.937 --> 00:19:16.541
Oh, man.
[sighs]


279
00:19:24.183 --> 00:19:25.781
You're really quiet.

280
00:19:25.783 --> 00:19:27.584
Oh.

281
00:19:27.586 --> 00:19:28.617
No.

282
00:19:28.619 --> 00:19:29.920
- No?
- No!


283
00:19:29.922 --> 00:19:32.789
You're like, my hair's
just blowing in the wind.


284
00:19:32.791 --> 00:19:34.359
[both laughing]

285
00:19:47.539 --> 00:19:49.306
[kisses]

286
00:19:49.308 --> 00:19:50.941
Oh, sh...

287
00:19:50.943 --> 00:19:52.478
Where are you
going?


288
00:19:53.845 --> 00:19:55.648
- Good night!
- You're going home?


289
00:19:57.416 --> 00:20:00.250
- I mean, can I get a kiss without the hair in it?
- [laughs]


290
00:20:00.252 --> 00:20:03.156
[panting, gasping]

291
00:20:07.358 --> 00:20:10.693
[squealing]

292
00:20:10.695 --> 00:20:12.631
[laughing]

293
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.413
[laughter echoing]

294
00:20:43.462 --> 00:20:45.662
[man]
She is lovely.


295
00:20:45.664 --> 00:20:48.431
[man 2] How far is she gonna go up
your ass though? You know what I mean?


296
00:20:48.433 --> 00:20:51.436
[chattering]

297
00:20:58.743 --> 00:21:01.677
- No, that's Adrianna. Chill.
- [chuckling]


298
00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:03.012
Adrianna, what's up?

299
00:21:03.014 --> 00:21:05.414
[chattering continues]

300
00:21:05.416 --> 00:21:08.585
- Going to the park?
- [Adrianna] Yeah. You going to the park?


301
00:21:08.587 --> 00:21:10.753
Hey, Madeline.
What's up?


302
00:21:10.755 --> 00:21:13.656
- [cat meows]
- What's in your basement?


303
00:21:13.658 --> 00:21:16.859
Yo, me and the guys over
there, we took bets,


304
00:21:16.861 --> 00:21:19.828
and we think there's
five dead bodies in there.


305
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:21.967
Five, for every finger
on your hand.


306
00:21:27.339 --> 00:21:30.576
I killed 'em
with my fingernails!

You're weird.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:43.586

- [Madeline] Okay, what do you guys think?

Yo, check out

- Oh, God. Henry. Henry.
- Your dad likes white women.


313
00:21:52.431 --> 00:21:54.364
- Yeah, he does.
- He sure does, dude.


314
00:21:54.366 --> 00:21:56.098
My mom's white, so...

315
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.068
Ooh! Jungle fever.

316

- Why? You've seen it before?
- Yep.


320
00:22:06.744 --> 00:22:09.712
[Madeline] What, are you guys,
like, porn freaks or something?


321
00:22:09.714 --> 00:22:12.549
I wouldn't say "porn freaks."
More like porn scholars.


322
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:14.017
- Right?
- Yeah.


323
00:22:14.019 --> 00:22:16.756
[Madeline] Okay, Henry, move.
I'm gonna find something.

hold her down, Dr. French?</i>

- [TV: woman] <i>Yeah.</i>


334
00:22:53.558 --> 00:22:55.493
- [Henry] I've never been in here a day in my life.
- No!


335
00:22:56.695 --> 00:22:58.862
[laughs] Oh, God.

336
00:22:58.864 --> 00:23:01.731
If you keep saying that, I'm
gonna have to throw you out.

Yeah? Well, just do it.
Go ahead. Do it. Whip it out.

[TV: woman] <i>You're putting
it in her asshole!</i>


356
00:23:58.589 --> 00:24:02.459
This is a good idea? You want her in
a psych ward for another six weeks?


357
00:24:02.461 --> 00:24:04.126
With her condition?

358
00:24:04.128 --> 00:24:06.930
- [boy] Are you crazy or something?
- No. I'm not. I'm not.

- Hi! Thank you!

Wh
-What?

406
00:27:24.329 --> 00:27:27.163
Why are you so jittery?
Relax.


407
00:27:27.165 --> 00:27:29.164
I'm not. Why are you
looking at my hands?


408
00:27:29.166 --> 00:27:31.203
- This is for you.
- Oh.

- Madeline?
- Hey.


410
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.777
- You okay?
- Hey, you know...


411
00:27:40.779 --> 00:27:41.880
Come talk to me.

412
00:27:43.682 --> 00:27:47.716
I've been thinking about how fun
it's been to work with you.


413
00:27:47.718 --> 00:27:49.152
- The group's been struggling.
- Yeah.


414
00:27:49.154 --> 00:27:51.220
And you get my work
like no one else.


415
00:27:51.222 --> 00:27:54.326
This process is so intimate,
and I'm really glad you're here.


416
00:27:56.026 --> 00:27:57.128
Me too.

417
00:27:58.897 --> 00:28:01.133
So I-I was thinking that,
um...


418
00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:04.433
I want to deepen the work

419
00:28:04.435 --> 00:28:07.936
that we're doing with the
character that you're gonna play.


420
00:28:07.938 --> 00:28:09.838
Do you want to name her?

421
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.274
Oh, I... I thought of a name.

422
00:28:12.276 --> 00:28:14.810
- What?
- Zia.


423
00:28:14.812 --> 00:28:16.247
- Zia?
- Yeah.


424
00:28:17.916 --> 00:28:20.753
That is...
It's really powerful.


425
00:28:22.853 --> 00:28:25.189
You know, one of the ways
that we could maybe...


426
00:28:27.258 --> 00:28:31.293
sort of make Zia
more concrete would be...


427
00:28:31.295 --> 00:28:34.463
I was thinking we could explore the
dream that you were telling me about


428
00:28:34.465 --> 00:28:36.164
and maybe act it out.

429
00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:38.233
- Dream?
- The one that you...


430
00:28:38.235 --> 00:28:40.470
With the iron, and you
slam your mom's hand.


431
00:28:40.472 --> 00:28:44.072
It's so just potent.

432
00:28:44.074 --> 00:28:48.110
- And I-I can't stop thinking about those images.
- [Evangeline's voice overlapping]


433
00:28:48.112 --> 00:28:51.347
You know, dream work
can be this really...


434
00:28:51.349 --> 00:28:54.216
<i>Uh, anyway...</i>

435
00:28:54.218 --> 00:28:57.119
- [chattering]
- we should...


436
00:28:57.121 --> 00:28:58.855
try acting it out.

437
00:28:58.857 --> 00:29:02.027
- How do you feel about that?
- [chattering continues]


438
00:29:04.963 --> 00:29:06.197
I, uh...

439
00:29:07.331 --> 00:29:10.232
- I guess, yeah.
- Okay.


440
00:29:10.234 --> 00:29:12.905
- [boisterous chattering
continues] -How did it go again?

out, we were in the car.</i>

<i>She thought my friends
hated me.</i>


443
00:29:23.313 --> 00:29:26.182
- Are they bullying you?
- <i>She thought my friends were being mean to me.</i>


444
00:29:26.184 --> 00:29:28.183
Are they being mean to you?

445
00:29:28.185 --> 00:29:31.386
Be silent. Great. You're hurting
your mother. That's fine.


446
00:29:31.388 --> 00:29:34.089
One day you'll live
to regret it.

[imitates car engine racing]

448
00:29:36.895 --> 00:29:39.962
Well, look at me. You're
looking at me like I'm crazy.


449
00:29:39.964 --> 00:29:42.197
Go play
with your kittens.

453
00:29:50.474 --> 00:29:52.010
Great.
Thank you.


454
00:29:54.345 --> 00:29:56.112
Thank you.

455
00:29:56.114 --> 00:29:58.548
Madeline, was that...
Is that about how it felt?


456
00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:00.817
What?

I think we need to, um,


458
00:30:02.986 --> 00:30:05.022
emphasize
the fractured, um,


459
00:30:07.258 --> 00:30:09.392
disjointed relationship with
the mother at the beginning.


460
00:30:09.394 --> 00:30:10.963
- Okay. At the beginning.
- Mm-hmm.


461
00:30:14.398 --> 00:30:16.097
[whispers]
Hey. Come here.


462
00:30:16.099 --> 00:30:17.366
Yeah. Come here.

463
00:30:17.368 --> 00:30:20.135
- [sighs]
- Try it.


464
00:30:20.137 --> 00:30:22.504
Just really look
at its face.


465
00:30:22.506 --> 00:30:26.010
Look at its face. Really look.
'Cause you're gonna become that.


466
00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:31.849
[Madeline exhales]

467
00:30:34.319 --> 00:30:38.123
[laughs, gasps]

468
00:30:39.389 --> 00:30:40.559
Can you see?

469
00:30:56.974 --> 00:30:59.811
[Evangeline]
Try to focus. That's right.


470
00:31:01.012 --> 00:31:03.281
Good. Great.

471
00:31:09.287 --> 00:31:11.156
Madeline!
Stay in the center.


472
00:31:12.223 --> 00:31:14.589
[Madeline inhales, exhales]

473
00:31:14.591 --> 00:31:19.028
Madeline, where are you go...
You're in the middle for this!


474
00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:22.466
[Madeline shudders, gasping]

475
00:31:24.335 --> 00:31:27.306

[pig snorting]

478
00:31:50.194 --> 00:31:51.463
Madeline.

479
00:31:53.464 --> 00:31:55.099
Are you done,
or should...?


480
00:31:58.468 --> 00:32:00.036
Is she done, or...?

481
00:32:00.038 --> 00:32:02.406
[panting, gasping]

[stuttered vocalizing]

485
00:32:43.747 --> 00:32:45.116
Hello!

486
00:32:50.455 --> 00:32:54.993
[muttering continues]

487
00:33:00.732 --> 00:33:03.402
CK is one block south.

488
00:33:22.352 --> 00:33:24.587
Have you seen
my daughter?


489
00:33:24.589 --> 00:33:26.491
No.
I'm sorry, no.


490
00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.395
[Madeline, gruff voice] Oodles of noodles.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.


491
00:33:32.397 --> 00:33:35.463
Oh, brah, brah, brah.

492
00:33:35.465 --> 00:33:38.099
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


493
00:33:38.101 --> 00:33:41.170
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah!


494
00:33:41.172 --> 00:33:44.773
Yeah. Yeah. Let me get some noodles.
Let me get some noodles.


495
00:33:44.775 --> 00:33:47.443
Go, go! Go, go! Go, go!

496
00:33:47.445 --> 00:33:49.511
Go, go! Go, go!

497
00:33:49.513 --> 00:33:52.114
Go, go! Go, go!

498
00:33:52.116 --> 00:33:53.749
Oh! Oh!

499
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:56.085
Hi. How are you?
How are you?


500
00:33:56.087 --> 00:33:57.723
I could really,
really like that.


501
00:33:59.456 --> 00:34:02.194
- Hi. How are you? How are you?
- [mutters, indistinct]


502
00:34:05.362 --> 00:34:07.797
[grunting, snorting]

503
00:34:07.799 --> 00:34:09.697
G

[grunting]

505
00:34:19.076 --> 00:34:21.210
Go, go! Go, go!

506
00:34:21.212 --> 00:34:23.482
Go, go! Go, go!

507
00:34:31.188 --> 00:34:33.625
[Madeline gasping]

508
00:34:40.364 --> 00:34:42.431
[mother]
<i>Yes, it's an emergency.</i>


509
00:34:42.433 --> 00:34:45.534
<i>Her prescription ran out
a week ago.</i>


510
00:34:45.536 --> 00:34:47.802
<i>Mm-hmm. Y...
Because she didn't tell me.</i>


511
00:34:47.804 --> 00:34:50.371
I'm sorry.
She's a teenager, so...


512
00:34:50.373 --> 00:34:53.145
She just doesn't tell me
everything in her life.


513
00:34:56.681 --> 00:34:59.650
Honey.
Honey, I have food.


514
00:35:00.685 --> 00:35:02.520
And a little present
for you.


515
00:35:09.293 --> 00:35:11.427
- Okay, well, here it is.
- [utensil clatters on plate]


516
00:35:11.429 --> 00:35:13.795
I'm leaving it here.

517
00:35:13.797 --> 00:35:16.898
Okay? There's...

518
00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.670
Maddie, maybe no rehearsal
for a while. Right? 'Cause...


519
00:35:23.174 --> 00:35:24.576
[exasperated sigh]

520
00:35:26.476 --> 00:35:29.281
All right.
Get it, or the cat'll get it.


521
00:35:48.465 --> 00:35:51.733
- [Madeline breathing]
- You're gonna want to be on varsity.


522
00:35:51.735 --> 00:35:54.802
But you don't have to,
you know.


523
00:35:54.804 --> 00:35:58.340
JV is for the younger guys too.
You know?


524
00:35:58.342 --> 00:36:00.909
It's not, like,
an embarrassing thing.


525
00:36:00.911 --> 00:36:03.848
That's what it's there for.
Come on, honey.


526
00:36:14.592 --> 00:36:17.226
- [Madeline] And that lady over there?
- [mother] Yes.


527
00:36:17.228 --> 00:36:20.195
- She's got cobwebs in her vagina.
- Oh!


528
00:36:20.197 --> 00:36:22.797
Never say that about an older
woman, because that'll be you.


529
00:36:22.799 --> 00:36:24.867
[laughing]

530
00:36:24.869 --> 00:36:26.534
It will be. It will be.

531
00:36:26.536 --> 00:36:28.837
- [Madeline] It already is!
- [laughs]


532
00:36:28.839 --> 00:36:30.471
- Okay, look at...
- Oh!


533
00:36:30.473 --> 00:36:33.742
See the middle one?
Do you know what I'm gonna say?


534
00:36:33.744 --> 00:36:36.244
Yeah... Well, no.
She's a lesbian.


535
00:36:36.246 --> 00:36:38.280
Well, she's actually not.

536
00:36:38.282 --> 00:36:42.851
I've seen her with a different man
in this park, like, just walking.


537
00:36:42.853 --> 00:36:45.588
Not doing anything,
but a different man,


538
00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:49.824
like,
maybe six or seven times.


539
00:36:49.826 --> 00:36:52.460
[laughs]
Just saying. Seriously.


540
00:36:52.462 --> 00:36:54.563
Oh, she gets with it?

541
00:36:54.565 --> 00:36:57.333
Yeah. I don't know what that is.
I mean, you really...


542
00:36:57.335 --> 00:36:59.170
Let's look at her.
Look at her.


543
00:37:00.371 --> 00:37:02.471
- Hey!
- [gasps] Oh, my God.


544
00:37:02.473 --> 00:37:04.974
- [sputtering]
- [laughs] Oh, God. Don't. Don't.


545
00:37:04.976 --> 00:37:06.912
Really sorry.
Did I hurt you, hon?


546
00:37:09.512 --> 00:37:12.516
[breathing]

547
00:37:18.522 --> 00:37:20.722
[Madeline]
<i>Mom?</i>


548
00:37:20.724 --> 00:37:23.659
<i>Oh, God. I-I kissed that guy.</i>
[laughs]


549
00:37:23.661 --> 00:37:25.594
- [horn honks]
- [mother] Gosh.


550
00:37:25.596 --> 00:37:28.264
Uh, maybe we should have...

551
00:37:28.266 --> 00:37:30.632
Maybe we shouldn't have,
like, rushed into something


552
00:37:30.634 --> 00:37:33.335
where there was quite
so much responsibility.


553
00:37:33.337 --> 00:37:36.338
He could have herpes.
He probably does.


554
00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:38.641
He knows a lot about porn.
[chuckles]


555
00:37:38.643 --> 00:37:40.375
And that's a sign.

556
00:37:40.377 --> 00:37:42.978
All just, like, around your
mouth, little pustules.


557
00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:46.282
Stop using that hand stuff.
That just dries your skin out.


558
00:37:46.284 --> 00:37:48.617
- That only makes the whole thing worse.
- I have allergies.


559
00:37:48.619 --> 00:37:51.387
No, you don't have allergies.
You have hypochondria.


560
00:37:51.389 --> 00:37:53.389
Are you looking at Tinder?
Is that what that is?


561
00:37:53.391 --> 00:37:55.623
Have you been snooping
on my phone?


562
00:37:55.625 --> 00:37:58.360
- I-I-I...
- Never trust anybody. Okay?


563
00:37:58.362 --> 00:38:01.697
- Can I get out now?
- No, wait, I...


564
00:38:01.699 --> 00:38:05.601
- Make sure to choose the right... Okay. Excuse me.
- [horn honks]


565
00:38:05.603 --> 00:38:08.570
Hi. Yeah. Okay.
All right.


566
00:38:08.572 --> 00:38:10.706
Jesus.
Have a good day! Good-bye!


567
00:38:10.708 --> 00:38:13.909
He's just doing his job,
you know, and you just...


568
00:38:13.911 --> 00:38:15.943
[mother]
You want to use protection.


569
00:38:15.945 --> 00:38:17.445
You want to be tested
beforehand.


570
00:38:17.447 --> 00:38:19.581
Why would I
get tested before?


571
00:38:19.583 --> 00:38:22.650
Okay, right. After.
Um... and...


572
00:38:22.652 --> 00:38:25.454
Oh, honey,
wait, wait, wait.


573
00:38:25.456 --> 00:38:27.523
Uh...

574
00:38:27.525 --> 00:38:29.891
[stammers] You know, I just...
I want...


575
00:38:29.893 --> 00:38:32.094
I want you to be careful.
You know?


576
00:38:32.096 --> 00:38:34.463
Because...
you're not...


577
00:38:34.465 --> 00:38:36.831
- I'm not what?
- Um...


578
00:38:36.833 --> 00:38:38.967
You know. You're not
like the other people.


579
00:38:38.969 --> 00:38:42.338
- Because I'm black?
- No. Madeline.


580
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.340
[mocking] Regina.

581
00:38:44.342 --> 00:38:47.942
I just feel like you're
maybe not ready, you know.


582
00:38:47.944 --> 00:38:50.478
- Your situation, which is different...
- What are you saying?


583
00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.614
It's different from the
other people in the...


584
00:38:52.616 --> 00:38:56.050
Everyone else is...
is stable, and, um...


585
00:38:56.052 --> 00:38:58.520
You know,
if you had an episode,


586
00:38:58.522 --> 00:38:59.987
which you probably will,

587
00:38:59.989 --> 00:39:01.590
what would happen?

588
00:39:01.592 --> 00:39:02.994
What, Evangeline
is gonna...


589
00:39:04.027 --> 00:39:05.629
- Fuck!
- You suck!


590
00:39:53.576 --> 00:39:55.110
[whispers]
Just stop it.


591
00:39:55.112 --> 00:39:56.911
[chattering]

592
00:39:56.913 --> 00:39:58.679
- Hi.
- Hi!


593
00:39:58.681 --> 00:40:00.481
You're here!
Hi!


594
00:40:00.483 --> 00:40:03.018
- Sorry we're late.
- No, no, it's good. It's good.


595
00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.186
No, you're here.
Come on. Let's go.


596
00:40:05.188 --> 00:40:08.489
- How are you?
- [Regina] She's so glad to have worked with you.


597
00:40:08.491 --> 00:40:11.125
Oh, we love her so much.
We're so glad she's here.


598
00:40:11.127 --> 00:40:13.996
Can you get in your wardrobe right away?
'Cause KK's only got 30 minutes.


599
00:40:13.998 --> 00:40:16.063
[KK] Yeah, I have
another set to be on.


600
00:40:16.065 --> 00:40:17.933
[Evangeline] Another set
with Robert De Niro.


601
00:40:17.935 --> 00:40:20.101
Madeline.

602
00:40:20.103 --> 00:40:22.570
Are you all right,
Mad?


603
00:40:22.572 --> 00:40:23.771
[man]
Because if we did...


604
00:40:23.773 --> 00:40:25.706
You could use your
fingernails on my back.


605
00:40:25.708 --> 00:40:27.675
That might be
real, real good.


606
00:40:27.677 --> 00:40:29.844
It's like
a nail file.


607
00:40:29.846 --> 00:40:33.782
KK, you could come too, baby. I could maybe
get in there and squeeze your ass cheeks.


608
00:40:33.784 --> 00:40:36.818
- You ready for that?
- [all chattering]


609
00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.487
Mom, you can come too,
if you want to.


610
00:40:39.489 --> 00:40:42.224
[Evangeline] Let's start
getting it together over here.


611
00:40:42.226 --> 00:40:44.092
[muffled] We'll put the...
Hey. Hey.


612
00:40:44.094 --> 00:40:46.061
I was thinking about
investing in a water bed.


613
00:40:46.063 --> 00:40:48.030
I heard it really
makes the rock.


614
00:40:48.032 --> 00:40:50.632
KK, you look so great!

615
00:40:50.634 --> 00:40:52.567
Everyone's gonna
love these posters.


616
00:40:52.569 --> 00:40:55.472
[chattering continues]

617
00:40:58.476 --> 00:41:01.742
[Evangeline] She... As soon as
she's done, get her over here.


618
00:41:01.744 --> 00:41:05.079
That's, um, long-haired.
Yeah. We can't... Can you...


619
00:41:05.081 --> 00:41:07.549
- Come on, sweetheart.
- [cat screeching]


620
00:41:07.551 --> 00:41:09.217
Geez!

621
00:41:09.219 --> 00:41:12.253
Madeline, can you just, uh, please
come over here with the animal?


622
00:41:12.255 --> 00:41:14.889
- I want to...
- Yeah. Come on. We gotta get going here.


623
00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:17.793
- Thank you.
- Okay. Great.


624
00:41:17.795 --> 00:41:20.195
[Evangeline] Just step right
up here on this mark, honey.


625
00:41:20.197 --> 00:41:22.563
That's the best
pig head ever.


626
00:41:22.565 --> 00:41:25.867
[Evangeline] Good. Okay,
you guys look amazing.


627
00:41:25.869 --> 00:41:27.971
Wow.
Wow, wow, wow.


628
00:41:29.105 --> 00:41:32.444
- Uh...
- Oh, Mommy. Bad news.


629
00:41:33.777 --> 00:41:35.677
Um, do you know what?

630
00:41:35.679 --> 00:41:38.213
It might be great if you could
just step out just for a minute.


631
00:41:38.215 --> 00:41:41.250
'Cause I think it will just allow
her to relax a little bit.


632
00:41:41.252 --> 00:41:44.286
- Okay.
- I mean, I know it's, like, sometimes a thing with parents.


633
00:41:44.288 --> 00:41:46.755
This is her snack.

634
00:41:46.757 --> 00:41:49.958
She probably won't take it,
but give it a try.


635
00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.929
- Okay, thank you. Thank you.
- Yeah.


636
00:41:53.596 --> 00:41:55.933
[Evangeline] Uh, do you
want this coconut thing?


637
00:41:57.233 --> 00:42:00.201
- [shutters clicking]
- Okay. Great. Um...


638
00:42:00.203 --> 00:42:02.105
- [clears throat]
- [Regina murmurs] Thank you.


639
00:42:04.708 --> 00:42:06.974
Oh, my God.

640
00:42:06.976 --> 00:42:08.809
- Okay.
- [shutters clicking]


641
00:42:08.811 --> 00:42:10.746
Okay. Hey.

642
00:42:10.748 --> 00:42:12.681
- Hi.
- Hi.


643
00:42:12.683 --> 00:42:15.317
My God. I feel like I haven't even got
to talk to you yet. Are you okay?


644
00:42:15.319 --> 00:42:17.184
- I'm good.
- Yeah? How's things with your mom?


645
00:42:17.186 --> 00:42:20.655
[sighs] On the way here, she
tried to give me the sex talk.


646
00:42:20.657 --> 00:42:22.891
- [laughs]
- I'm 16. I know everything.


647
00:42:22.893 --> 00:42:25.594
Are you kidding?
Oh, my God. That is so...


648
00:42:25.596 --> 00:42:28.596
She just got the sex talk in the car.
That's so weird, because we were just...


649
00:42:28.598 --> 00:42:32.034
- [man] That's crazy.
- Hunter, you don't get to be a part of this conversation.


650
00:42:32.036 --> 00:42:35.070
That's so weird, because Laura was just
telling us, and then we did that pi...


651
00:42:35.072 --> 00:42:37.639
It's so funny.
Okay, let's shoot this.


652
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:41.076
- Can you get me that stool? I wanna sit over here.
- [woman] Okay. Sure.


653
00:42:41.078 --> 00:42:43.712
[Evangeline] Can you guys
change positions, like...


654
00:42:43.714 --> 00:42:45.746
Yeah, yeah.
Good, good.


655
00:42:45.748 --> 00:42:48.916
- [Hunter] You're on your game today, babe.
- [Evangeline] Oh, yeah.


656
00:42:48.918 --> 00:42:53.655
Here. Hold on. This is just... You know what?
It's weird, that sort of falling down.


657
00:42:53.657 --> 00:42:56.023
Can you just...
Can we get the costume...


658
00:42:56.025 --> 00:42:59.760
- Do you know what? Fuck. Do you know what?
- What is it?


659
00:42:59.762 --> 00:43:03.331
I-I love these costumes, and I know
it's exactly what we talked about,


660
00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:05.333
but now that I'm seeing
it all together,


661
00:43:05.335 --> 00:43:07.302
I'm just starting to
feel like it's not...


662
00:43:07.304 --> 00:43:09.637
These costumes are
from the prison theme.


663
00:43:09.639 --> 00:43:12.907
And I think now we're moving on to this
whole mother-and-daughter theme...


664
00:43:12.909 --> 00:43:15.309
- I think I was wrong. Can we change?
- What are you talking about?


665
00:43:15.311 --> 00:43:19.614
We've got two hot black chicks in space
suits with big hats and a white cat.


666
00:43:19.616 --> 00:43:22.617
Fuck off. Fuck off.
'Cause I just need to get this...


667
00:43:22.619 --> 00:43:24.820
- [woman] What do you want to change?
- Can you, uh...


668
00:43:24.822 --> 00:43:28.190
- Let's just put them back into the clothes they came in.
- [Hunter] Oh, my God.


669
00:43:28.192 --> 00:43:31.996
Well, it's...
Yeah. Can we try that?


670
00:43:32.996 --> 00:43:34.362
Do you know what?

671
00:43:34.364 --> 00:43:37.032
[whispering] Could you
go and ask her mom


672
00:43:37.034 --> 00:43:40.302
if we could borrow her
sweater for the shoot?


673
00:43:40.304 --> 00:43:41.773
- Yeah.
- Thank you.


674
00:43:44.407 --> 00:43:46.808
- [shutter clicking]
- [Evangeline] Okay, good.


675
00:43:46.810 --> 00:43:48.876
Um...

676
00:43:48.878 --> 00:43:50.779
[whispering] Madeline. Madeline.
[clicking tongue]


677
00:43:50.781 --> 00:43:52.648
Just... You know what?
Try...


678
00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:55.916
You know how you're really good at
getting, like, emotional on cue?


679
00:43:55.918 --> 00:43:59.154
Just try one this time with,
like, a lot of emotion.


680
00:43:59.156 --> 00:44:00.755
Any emotion?

681
00:44:00.757 --> 00:44:03.224
Yeah, like, um...
I mean, just like...


682
00:44:03.226 --> 00:44:06.663
Think about how you felt when your
mom gave you the sex talk. Try that.


683
00:44:07.931 --> 00:44:09.831
[shouts]

684
00:44:09.833 --> 00:44:11.299
[Hunter]
That's really fucking good.


685
00:44:11.301 --> 00:44:15.436
- [shouting continues]
- More! Yes! Yes!


686
00:44:15.438 --> 00:44:18.440
Now just less. I mean,
just like a little...


687
00:44:18.442 --> 00:44:20.878
That, but subtle.
More subtle.


688
00:44:25.315 --> 00:44:28.183
Uh... Okay, wait. Hold on.
Hold on. I don't know.


689
00:44:28.185 --> 00:44:31.154
Maybe, just, I didn't
understand what you were...


690
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.690
Okay, do you know,
uh...


691
00:44:34.692 --> 00:44:39.027
What if it made you
feel kind of sad?


692
00:44:39.029 --> 00:44:43.065
Like just thinking about what it means
for her, and it was, like, a lot more...


693
00:44:43.067 --> 00:44:44.802
Depressed?

694
00:44:46.136 --> 00:44:49.036
Yeah. Let's try that.
Let's try that.


695
00:44:49.038 --> 00:44:51.408
Just... Just... Just for
the photograph. Okay?


696
00:44:53.444 --> 00:44:56.143
[shutter clicking]

697
00:44:56.145 --> 00:44:58.015
Is that...
That's depressed?


698
00:44:59.083 --> 00:45:01.782
A little bit more.

699
00:45:01.784 --> 00:45:04.485
More, more, more.
Oh, good. Yeah.


700
00:45:04.487 --> 00:45:06.387
Oh, yeah. Good, good, good, good!
That's so good.


701
00:45:06.389 --> 00:45:08.322
[shutter clicking]

702
00:45:08.324 --> 00:45:11.294
Okay, great. Can you turn
and say something to KK?


703
00:45:16.967 --> 00:45:18.836
[Hunter]
Yeah, KK. Perfect.


704
00:45:20.237 --> 00:45:22.471
[whispering]

705
00:45:22.473 --> 00:45:24.141
[shutter clicks]

706
00:45:27.377 --> 00:45:29.744
[laughs] Oh.

707
00:45:29.746 --> 00:45:31.415
[shutter continues clicking]

708
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:34.752
[beeps]

709
00:45:54.971 --> 00:45:57.838
Regina, could you come
in here for a second?


710
00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:00.442
I have an idea,
and I was thinking...


711
00:46:00.444 --> 00:46:03.512
[clears throat]
Um...


712
00:46:03.514 --> 00:46:07.382
I would love it if you would just pose
with Madeline for a minute and then...


713
00:46:07.384 --> 00:46:09.851
'Cause you're not...
You won't be on camera.


714
00:46:09.853 --> 00:46:11.920
- The two of you together...
- Oh, my...


715
00:46:11.922 --> 00:46:14.288
We won't see you. You won't be on camera.
You'll be off.


716
00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:16.558
- Can you give her her sweater back?
- Yeah, sure.


717
00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:19.027
- Just give her her sweater.
- This sounds like a great idea.


718
00:46:19.029 --> 00:46:21.329
Okay, good.
Good, good, good.


719
00:46:21.331 --> 00:46:23.331
- Just... Um...
- Yeah, I'm sorry.


720
00:46:23.333 --> 00:46:25.500
Okay, great.

721
00:46:25.502 --> 00:46:30.137
And then, um,
I'm just thinking,


722
00:46:30.139 --> 00:46:33.507
like, we'll just get you and your mom and
something like a little less powerful,


723
00:46:33.509 --> 00:46:35.946
a little
kind of more just...


724
00:46:37.246 --> 00:46:39.181
I don't know,
but, uh, do you know...


725
00:46:39.183 --> 00:46:41.483
Actually, you know what? Let's
have you sit right here.


726
00:46:41.485 --> 00:46:43.488
So you're just looking
at each other. Okay?


727
00:46:44.955 --> 00:46:47.288
Thank you.
Thank you very much.


728
00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:50.026
- Oh! [chuckles]
- [Hunter] Don't worry about what I said about the water bed.


729
00:46:53.330 --> 00:46:55.496
I know, I know.
It's been...


730
00:46:55.498 --> 00:46:57.465
[man] We've been
workshopping for months.


731
00:46:57.467 --> 00:47:01.068
I'm not sure this
is turning into a play.


732
00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:03.905
[Evangeline] It is a play.
It's not a <i>play</i> play.


733
00:47:03.907 --> 00:47:06.574
It's just not about
making sense all the time.


734
00:47:06.576 --> 00:47:08.476
I don't know
if you really need me.


735
00:47:08.478 --> 00:47:11.279
- You know, it's the story...
- A lot of us are barely in this anymore.


736
00:47:11.281 --> 00:47:13.181
Right.
You know, actually...


737
00:47:13.183 --> 00:47:16.150
You're mostly using
Madeline and KK.


738
00:47:16.152 --> 00:47:19.286
We all are in... You're
part of this collective.


739
00:47:19.288 --> 00:47:23.458
But if you... If you go now, what's
that going to say to everybody else?


740
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:26.293
So let's get ready
for doctors and nurses.


741
00:47:26.295 --> 00:47:29.032
Um, why don't you
just stay for today?


742
00:47:30.534 --> 00:47:33.000
Now, who's, um,
gonna play the patient?


743
00:47:33.002 --> 00:47:34.936
Ooh, I'll do it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll do it.


744
00:47:34.938 --> 00:47:36.174
Madeline,
you want to do it?


745
00:47:37.241 --> 00:47:39.009
I'm okay. Mm-hmm.

746
00:47:40.177 --> 00:47:41.909
[chattering, laughing]

747
00:47:41.911 --> 00:47:43.612
[woman]
I'm ready and waiting to go.


748
00:47:43.614 --> 00:47:46.317
- Come on!
- [chattering continues]


749
00:47:48.185 --> 00:47:51.887
Doctor? Doctor.

750
00:47:51.889 --> 00:47:54.288
Yeah, I'd like to do the improv
with the same characters


751
00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:59.529
and maybe try to generate text and
this time in a psychiatric ward, okay?


752
00:48:00.596 --> 00:48:02.098
Okay.

753
00:48:03.299 --> 00:48:05.666
What seems
to be the problem?


754
00:48:05.668 --> 00:48:08.205
I'm sick.

755
00:48:09.239 --> 00:48:10.971
Yeah?
What do you have?


756
00:48:10.973 --> 00:48:12.342
I'm de...

757
00:48:15.913 --> 00:48:17.048
Pregnant.

758
00:48:22.386 --> 00:48:24.418
Oh.

759
00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:27.355
With, uh...

760
00:48:27.357 --> 00:48:31.061
[Evangeline] Hey, Madeline. It's a
psychiatric ward, not a pregnancy ward.


761
00:48:33.663 --> 00:48:37.197
My mom wants me
to have an abortion,


762
00:48:37.199 --> 00:48:40.969
but, um, I'm gonna
keep the baby.


763
00:48:40.971 --> 00:48:44.139
Wh... I mean, do you...

764
00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:46.942
Do you think you're...
you're ready?


765
00:48:46.944 --> 00:48:50.480
I think I'm ready. I... I
want to take care of someone.


766
00:48:51.715 --> 00:48:53.416
Like she will.

767
00:48:57.487 --> 00:49:03.224
But I'm afraid that the birth
will be horrible.


768
00:49:03.226 --> 00:49:05.092
How will it
be horrible?


769
00:49:05.094 --> 00:49:07.027
Bloody and hard.

770
00:49:07.029 --> 00:49:13.067
What if the baby
doesn't wanna come out?


771
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:17.540
What if it's, like...
[screaming in pain]


772
00:49:21.344 --> 00:49:22.679
[gasps]

773
00:49:29.518 --> 00:49:31.087
[gasps]

774
00:49:38.494 --> 00:49:40.998
And it dies inside of me.

775
00:49:46.168 --> 00:49:50.771
Let's take five minutes, and then
we'll, uh, regroup and try some more.


776
00:49:50.773 --> 00:49:52.310
Okay.

777
00:49:56.746 --> 00:49:59.380
- [man singing, faint]
- [chattering]


778
00:49:59.382 --> 00:50:02.016
[woman]
Do I have a weird time?


779
00:50:02.018 --> 00:50:03.553
Yeah. [chuckles]

780
00:50:09.592 --> 00:50:12.293
Hey. It's just me.

781
00:50:12.295 --> 00:50:15.566
I was just saying hi.

782
00:50:17.266 --> 00:50:19.502
Oh, are you okay?

783
00:50:22.406 --> 00:50:26.243
Just ready to give birth,
I guess.


784
00:50:32.782 --> 00:50:36.784
[Evangeline] Yeah. Look, if you want
to be there with all the family, fine.


785
00:50:36.786 --> 00:50:39.422
I'll... That's fine.

786
00:50:42.426 --> 00:50:45.328
No, I said it's fine.

787
00:50:46.496 --> 00:50:48.829
Hey.

788
00:50:48.831 --> 00:50:51.231
- Hello?
- [siren wailing]


789
00:50:51.233 --> 00:50:53.300
Hello!

790
00:50:53.302 --> 00:50:55.570
Can I just talk about
next week's rehearsal?


791
00:50:55.572 --> 00:50:57.806
Hey, guys. Where are you going?
Where are they all going?


792
00:50:57.808 --> 00:50:59.741
- [man] See ya. Have a good one.
- See ya.


793
00:50:59.743 --> 00:51:01.212
- Um...
- Guys! Where...


794
00:51:02.244 --> 00:51:04.579
- I let everybody go.
- What?


795
00:51:04.581 --> 00:51:08.248
Hey, guys! Guys!
We're not done rehearsing.


796
00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:11.686
No, no, we are!
We'll catch you next time!


797
00:51:11.688 --> 00:51:13.655
Madeline!

798
00:51:13.657 --> 00:51:16.558
Regina. Hi. Yeah.
It's Evangeline.


799
00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:19.126
We, um...
We finished rehearsal early,


800
00:51:19.128 --> 00:51:24.331
and so we were calling to see if
it would be all right with you


801
00:51:24.333 --> 00:51:27.501
if, um, Madeline came to my
house for dinner tonight.


802
00:51:27.503 --> 00:51:29.838
And then you wouldn't have
to come back and pick her up,


803
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:33.407
and I could... I could drop her
off at, like, 9:30 or 10:00 or...


804
00:51:33.409 --> 00:51:36.244
- [sirens wailing]
- Yeah, I hope that's okay. Everyone's leaving now.


805
00:51:36.246 --> 00:51:38.780
So I think I will
just take her home and...


806
00:51:38.782 --> 00:51:42.753
Do you want to say something to her?
On the message.


807
00:51:45.121 --> 00:51:47.590
[subway train passing]

808
00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.804
[chattering, faint]

809
00:52:01.137 --> 00:52:02.806
[chattering]

810
00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.920
Aw!

811
00:52:18.922 --> 00:52:21.559
- M... Madeline. That's my husband George.
- Hi.


812
00:52:24.393 --> 00:52:26.860
You know what?

813
00:52:26.862 --> 00:52:29.697
- [chattering]
- Everybody?


814
00:52:29.699 --> 00:52:32.534
Madeline's
a really great actress.


815
00:52:32.536 --> 00:52:36.503
Yeah. She's applied to a whole
bunch of really fantastic colleges


816
00:52:36.505 --> 00:52:39.373
like Juilliard and NYU.

817
00:52:39.375 --> 00:52:41.909
- [cheering, applauding]
- [woman] Yay, Madeline.


818
00:52:41.911 --> 00:52:45.713
Yeah. I-I really don't know
if I'll get in though.


819
00:52:45.715 --> 00:52:48.782
She's amazing. She could get
into any college that she wants.


820
00:52:48.784 --> 00:52:51.219
If Evangeline says it,
it's true.


821
00:52:51.221 --> 00:52:53.387
[George] Look what
I've got for you guys!


822
00:52:53.389 --> 00:52:55.856
Here we come, here we
come, here we come.


823
00:52:55.858 --> 00:52:58.559
- Better be good.
- Come on. Who said that? Who said that?


824
00:52:58.561 --> 00:53:00.862
You know I'm the one
who said it.


825
00:53:00.864 --> 00:53:04.699
One for you, girl?
Okay, good?


826
00:53:04.701 --> 00:53:06.601
Mama, I do that for you.
What about you, sweetheart?


827
00:53:06.603 --> 00:53:08.536
I'm a vegan.

828
00:53:08.538 --> 00:53:10.605
Vegan. All right.
All right, vegan.


829
00:53:10.607 --> 00:53:12.907
I'm-a put this down here.
I'm-a take you out bread.


830
00:53:12.909 --> 00:53:14.976
- Do you want some bread?
- No, thank you.


831
00:53:14.978 --> 00:53:16.677
Okay, I'm-a leave you alone.
Listen, guys.


832
00:53:16.679 --> 00:53:18.545
I'm-a be right back
in a minute.


833
00:53:18.547 --> 00:53:21.815
[woman] Madeline was telling us
your show is about prison?


834
00:53:21.817 --> 00:53:24.585
Uh, no.
No, it's not.


835
00:53:24.587 --> 00:53:25.954
It's... It's a metaphor.

836
00:53:25.956 --> 00:53:28.255
- Metaphor?
- No, it's not a metaphor.


837
00:53:28.257 --> 00:53:32.893
It's-It's, um... It's
about mental illness.


838
00:53:32.895 --> 00:53:35.530
- And-And...
- Wow.


839
00:53:35.532 --> 00:53:38.299
Madeline is the lead.

840
00:53:38.301 --> 00:53:44.507
I'm really interested in people who are
out of control of their circumstances.


841
00:53:47.944 --> 00:53:49.811
Yeah.

842
00:53:49.813 --> 00:53:52.349
[wind blowing]

843
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:03.324

[women chattering]

846
00:54:15.505 --> 00:54:17.605
Welcome to the nut show!

847
00:54:17.607 --> 00:54:20.277
- [man] Oh, no. Don't!
- [applauding]


848
00:54:20.976 --> 00:54:23.411
- [screeching]
- What?


849
00:54:23.413 --> 00:54:26.550
Nut is a peanut
because they pee a lot.


850
00:54:27.916 --> 00:54:29.650
Jason, no!

851
00:54:29.652 --> 00:54:31.554
- Okay.
- [shouts] A nut...


852
00:54:32.589 --> 00:54:34.454
[shouting]
...can kill you!


853
00:54:34.456 --> 00:54:36.958
- Em...
- [cheering]


854
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.027
[Evangeline]
You can't do that.


855
00:54:39.029 --> 00:54:42.565
You're making a huge mess here, and you
really can't stand on the couch, all right?


856
00:54:44.801 --> 00:54:47.302
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.
- [man] Give me a smile.


857
00:54:47.304 --> 00:54:49.369
[woman] Probably
just a little tired.


858
00:54:49.371 --> 00:54:51.308
That's okay.
It's all for you, sweetie.


859
00:54:54.643 --> 00:54:56.443
Where's Solomon?

860
00:54:56.445 --> 00:54:58.846
- [chattering]
- [man] Come here.


861
00:54:58.848 --> 00:55:00.581
[woman]
Don't worry about it.


862
00:55:00.583 --> 00:55:02.319
[woman] Really? That's it?

863
00:55:06.422 --> 00:55:08.021
[Madeline] Hey.

864
00:55:08.023 --> 00:55:10.426
Are you
Evangeline's daughter?


865
00:55:12.895 --> 00:55:15.797
Blessings for the one
that's on the way...


866
00:55:15.799 --> 00:55:17.364
[partygoers] Aw!

867
00:55:17.366 --> 00:55:21.568
and hopefully will grow
into an incredible host


868
00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:23.503
like Mom and Dad.

869
00:55:23.505 --> 00:55:25.373
[woman] Yes.

870
00:55:25.375 --> 00:55:27.942
This is for Evangeline
and George.


871
00:55:27.944 --> 00:55:29.543
- Yes.
- Yes.


872
00:55:29.545 --> 00:55:32.045
- To future baby.
- Beautiful baby.


873
00:55:32.047 --> 00:55:35.550
[man] Go ahead.
Next we're gonna...


874
00:55:35.552 --> 00:55:39.619
- [partygoers] Aw!
- The future of enjoying family and friends.


875
00:55:39.621 --> 00:55:43.056
[Evangeline] To the right.
Are you sure you're okay to...


876
00:55:43.058 --> 00:55:45.662
To go to the bathroom by myself?
Yeah, I'm fine. Thanks.

Smile.

878

Hi, Onur.

879
00:55:52.402 --> 00:55:54.737
[woman] You guys need
help with cleaning up?


880
00:55:58.375 --> 00:56:00.407
- What?
- It was like pig face.


881
00:56:00.409 --> 00:56:02.645
- Pig face?
- Yeah, like pig face. You know, like...

some more vino.

My, what soft skin
you have.


885
00:56:24.134 --> 00:56:26.036
I won't tell Evangeline.

886
00:56:35.811 --> 00:56:38.478
[woman]
It's showtime. Showtime.


887

[man] She used to be
in vaudeville, y'all.


907
00:58:13.243 --> 00:58:16.710
- [all laughing]
- She's not that old.


908
00:58:16.712 --> 00:58:18.880
She's not that old.

909
00:58:18.882 --> 00:58:20.914
Mama, Mama. Mama.

910
00:58:20.916 --> 00:58:23.520
[laughing, shouting]

911
00:58:26.556 --> 00:58:28.822
- [door closes]
- [liquid pouring]


912
00:58:28.824 --> 00:58:30.291
- [George] Hey.
- Hi.


913
00:58:30.293 --> 00:58:32.860
- Hey. Mad... Made...
- Madeline.


914
00:58:32.862 --> 00:58:34.228
Madeline.
Right. Right.


915
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:36.630
- George.
- Yes. [laughing]


916
00:58:36.632 --> 00:58:39.065
- How are you?
- I'm okay. How are you?


917
00:58:39.067 --> 00:58:40.902
Doing great.

918
00:58:40.904 --> 00:58:43.003
- You're really talented, you know?
- Oh.


919
00:58:43.005 --> 00:58:45.206
- Thanks.
- Yeah, you're welcome.


920
00:58:45.208 --> 00:58:48.479
- [hisses, laughs]
- [water sloshing]


921
00:58:51.179 --> 00:58:52.913
- You need anything?
- So... Oh, no.


922
00:58:52.915 --> 00:58:54.484
- You good?
- I'm okay.


923
00:58:55.918 --> 00:58:58.552
You need anything?

924
00:58:58.554 --> 00:59:00.688
[laughs]
No, I got it. I got it.


925
00:59:00.690 --> 00:59:03.056
- They always leave it for me to clean up.
- Hmm.


926
00:59:03.058 --> 00:59:04.594
Uh-huh.

927
00:59:05.561 --> 00:59:07.994
So, um,

928
00:59:07.996 --> 00:59:10.898
how long have you and
Evangeline been together?


929
00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:13.333
Oh. We've been together
five years.


930
00:59:13.335 --> 00:59:15.238
Five beautiful years.

931
00:59:16.572 --> 00:59:18.271
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.


932
00:59:18.273 --> 00:59:23.513
That's funny, because
she has never mentioned you.


933
00:59:24.947 --> 00:59:26.681
She hasn't?

934
00:59:26.683 --> 00:59:28.349
- Nope.
- [laughing]


935
00:59:28.351 --> 00:59:31.652
That's my wife.
[laughing]


936
00:59:31.654 --> 00:59:33.290
That's my wife.

937
00:59:37.192 --> 00:59:38.728
Um...

938
00:59:40.330 --> 00:59:43.900
I am so happy
I came to this party.


939
00:59:45.868 --> 00:59:48.369
- I'm glad you came too.
- Yeah.


940
00:59:48.371 --> 00:59:50.103
Had a good time?

941
00:59:50.105 --> 00:59:51.641
So great.

942
00:59:52.942 --> 00:59:55.108
[laughs]

943
00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:58.181
Mmm. We enjoyed having you.

944
00:59:59.715 --> 01:00:01.648
- You sure you don't need anything?
- Yeah.


945
01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:03.020
Okay.

946
01:00:04.152 --> 01:00:05.987
There's more juice
in the fridge.


947
01:00:05.989 --> 01:00:08.989
- I could grab you some juice or something.
- I don't need any juice.


948
01:00:08.991 --> 01:00:10.326
Okay.

949
01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:16.963
So, um, it's my birthday
this weekend.


950
01:00:16.965 --> 01:00:19.266
Are you serious?

951
01:00:19.268 --> 01:00:21.402
Well, happy birthday.
You're turning...


952
01:00:21.404 --> 01:00:23.771
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen.


953
01:00:23.773 --> 01:00:28.875
And do you know what I am
doing for my birthday?


954
01:00:28.877 --> 01:00:30.978
Mm-mmm.

955
01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:34.585
I'm going
to lose my virginity.


956
01:00:35.851 --> 01:00:37.817
[chuckles]

957
01:00:37.819 --> 01:00:40.954
[nervous chuckle]
That's... That's great.


958
01:00:40.956 --> 01:00:43.891
That's great. Who's...
Who's the... [laughs]


959
01:00:43.893 --> 01:00:46.159
Um, who's the lucky guy?

960
01:00:46.161 --> 01:00:48.862
- I haven't decided yet.
- Okay.


961
01:00:48.864 --> 01:00:55.335
You know, if you have
any recommendations


962
01:00:55.337 --> 01:00:58.139
for, like, a position
or anything, for...


963
01:00:58.141 --> 01:01:00.041
'Cause I'm a beginner,
you know.


964
01:01:00.043 --> 01:01:06.713
I was thinking
that I could bend over,


965
01:01:06.715 --> 01:01:11.121
and he could squeeze
my ass cheeks.


966
01:01:12.255 --> 01:01:14.422
- [giggling]
- [door opens]


967
01:01:14.424 --> 01:01:15.993
Whoa. Hey.

968
01:01:30.105 --> 01:01:32.239
Were you drinking
at my house, Madeline?


969
01:01:32.241 --> 01:01:34.308
Because you're not acting
like yourself.


970
01:01:34.310 --> 01:01:37.010
You don't know myself.
I am being myself.


971
01:01:37.012 --> 01:01:39.246
I do know you.
I know you!


972
01:01:39.248 --> 01:01:41.351
Are you insecure?

973
01:01:42.884 --> 01:01:46.721
- What?
- Are you... insecure?


974
01:01:46.723 --> 01:01:48.922
I don't know!
No. I mean no.


975
01:01:48.924 --> 01:01:52.927
I'm so... I'm not insecure. I'm trying
to do something that's really hard.


976
01:01:52.929 --> 01:01:56.230
And I am, you know, holding down
the fort on the whole project,


977
01:01:56.232 --> 01:02:00.000
and I'm spearheading this very collaborative
vision that is fucking just...


978
01:02:00.002 --> 01:02:02.802
kind of fucked.

979
01:02:02.804 --> 01:02:05.239
So, yes. I mean yes,
I'm insecure,


980
01:02:05.241 --> 01:02:07.340
because I don't know
if the project's gonna work.


981
01:02:07.342 --> 01:02:10.143
I don't even know if my fucking
marriage is gonna work.


982
01:02:10.145 --> 01:02:12.048
And I don't...

983
01:02:15.451 --> 01:02:18.052
- Good.
- What? What's good?


984
01:02:18.054 --> 01:02:20.123
That you admitted it.

985
01:02:24.761 --> 01:02:26.463
I'm insecure too.

986
01:02:29.965 --> 01:02:32.335
It's why I want you
to like me so much.


987
01:02:43.512 --> 01:02:45.415
I don't think...

988
01:02:47.949 --> 01:02:51.518
I don't think I should be
in your project anymore.


989
01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.189
What?

990
01:03:05.567 --> 01:03:06.902
Okay.

991
01:03:08.203 --> 01:03:11.538
I feel like, you know,
we're...


992
01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.875
I think you might
be right, Madeline.


993
01:03:14.877 --> 01:03:17.311
I think maybe you shouldn't
be in the project.


994
01:03:17.313 --> 01:03:21.882
And actually, it feels
like a huge relief.


995
01:03:21.884 --> 01:03:24.552
I mean, I... Of course,
I want you to be in it,


996
01:03:24.554 --> 01:03:27.087
but... [sighs]

997
01:03:27.089 --> 01:03:30.259
this doesn't feel like
it's good for either of us.


998
01:03:37.833 --> 01:03:39.770
- [gasps]
- [tires screech]


999
01:03:41.404 --> 01:03:43.206
What was that?

1000
01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:47.308
What... Was it a cat?

1001
01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:49.976
I don't know.
Maybe it was nothing.


1002
01:03:49.978 --> 01:03:51.982
Should...
Should we check on it?


1003
01:03:53.049 --> 01:03:55.118
- No, it's dead.
- Oh.


1004
01:04:40.128 --> 01:04:43.465
[car horn honking]

1005
01:04:46.668 --> 01:04:49.172
[children shouting]

1006
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:54.476
[wings flapping]

1007
01:05:03.652 --> 01:05:06.322
[chattering]

1008
01:05:28.444 --> 01:05:29.945
[chuckles]

1009
01:06:01.009 --> 01:06:04.110
[phone line ringing]

1010
01:06:04.112 --> 01:06:06.982
[ringing continues]

1011
01:06:08.985 --> 01:06:10.650
[Evangeline on phone]
<i>Hey, Madeline.</i>


1012
01:06:10.652 --> 01:06:13.587
<i>We didn't see you at rehearsal today.
We hope you're okay.</i>


1013
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:15.456
- Mmm.
- [meows]


1014
01:06:15.458 --> 01:06:17.623
[kissing]

1015
01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:19.929
Mmm. Mmm.

1016
01:06:24.099 --> 01:06:25.402
[Regina] Madeline?

1017
01:06:26.701 --> 01:06:29.068
Are you coming
downstairs?


1018
01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:31.206
Someone's here
to see us.


1019
01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:40.146
[Evangeline]
Madeline, is that you?


1020
01:06:40.148 --> 01:06:43.583
My God. Last time, um,
they left out the mint lemon.


1021
01:06:43.585 --> 01:06:45.318
I don't know why.

1022
01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.487
As if I couldn't do it.
Just put a tent up.


1023
01:06:47.489 --> 01:06:51.458
- What did I do? Nothing.
- But it's usually a lot more than just putting a tent up.


1024
01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.226
Right.

1025
01:06:53.228 --> 01:06:56.230
Our board member Christa, that's
her favorite, first of all.


1026
01:06:56.232 --> 01:06:58.364
So are the... Are they...
Oh.


1027
01:06:58.366 --> 01:07:03.369
Oh. Madeline.
Look who's here.


1028
01:07:03.371 --> 01:07:05.773
- Hi, Evangeline.
- She came to ask about you, but we...


1029
01:07:05.775 --> 01:07:09.043
- Hi.
- We've just been talking about, um...


1030
01:07:09.045 --> 01:07:11.811
- Your mother's been telling me about her...
- The tent.


1031
01:07:11.813 --> 01:07:15.049
- The tent. The event tent.
- Which you get because it's...


1032
01:07:15.051 --> 01:07:18.384
Yes. It's, like, um, you know all
about that. You know, just...


1033
01:07:18.386 --> 01:07:20.621
Yeah, I mean I guess
it's kind of the same.


1034
01:07:20.623 --> 01:07:24.391
She said that you said
you were pregnant?


1035
01:07:24.393 --> 01:07:26.659
- And I told her...
- Well, just in the improv.


1036
01:07:26.661 --> 01:07:28.695
absolutely, of course not.

1037
01:07:28.697 --> 01:07:31.264
You're a virgin.
You've never even kissed a boy.


1038
01:07:31.266 --> 01:07:34.500
We've really missed her.
I mean, she is amazing.


1039
01:07:34.502 --> 01:07:36.469
You're an amazing actress.

1040
01:07:36.471 --> 01:07:41.175
And just the capacity
to go, you know...


1041
01:07:41.177 --> 01:07:43.710
She has a lot of depth,

1042
01:07:43.712 --> 01:07:45.378
and I'm sure
it runs in the family.


1043
01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:47.815
Yeah?
I think so too.


1044
01:07:47.817 --> 01:07:51.652
I mean, it might even be great to
just sort of have you... Do you act?


1045
01:07:51.654 --> 01:07:53.719
- Do you want to try something?
- [laughs]


1046
01:07:53.721 --> 01:07:56.255
Just, like, as a part
of the workshop, we could...


1047
01:07:56.257 --> 01:07:58.261
Oh, my goodness. Um...

1048
01:08:01.429 --> 01:08:02.765
[laughs]

1049
01:08:06.534 --> 01:08:09.235
[Regina]
I wonder what the plan is.


1050
01:08:09.237 --> 01:08:13.373
Do you think... Is it that
she saw something about me?


1051
01:08:13.375 --> 01:08:17.247
You know, because we were talking
for a long time there, and...


1052
01:08:19.448 --> 01:08:23.883
<i>She is really freckly, which is something
she'll want to watch out for, you know?</i>


1053
01:08:23.885 --> 01:08:26.520
<i>I hope she gets every one
of those things checked,</i>


1054
01:08:26.522 --> 01:08:30.059
<i>because it only takes one.</i>

1055
01:08:33.162 --> 01:08:34.497
I wonder if she's
on top of that.


1056
01:08:43.404 --> 01:08:46.440
- Hi.
- Hi, Regina.


1057
01:08:46.442 --> 01:08:49.642
Everybody remember Regina?
I invited her to join us today.


1058
01:08:49.644 --> 01:08:51.680
- Hi!
- Hi.


1059
01:08:57.219 --> 01:08:59.255
[chattering]

1060
01:09:08.898 --> 01:09:11.531
[Evangeline]
Great, okay. So, let's, um...


1061
01:09:11.533 --> 01:09:14.334
Let's rotate,
and let's have a new leader.


1062
01:09:14.336 --> 01:09:17.574
Regina, you want to step up
front and be the leader?


1063
01:09:19.375 --> 01:09:22.608
Come on. It's fun.

1064
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:24.180
Okay.

1065
01:09:28.716 --> 01:09:31.186
- I don't know what to do.
- [chuckling]


1066
01:09:38.293 --> 01:09:39.492
[laughing]

1067
01:09:39.494 --> 01:09:41.628
Just kind of what...

1068
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:47.233
[Evangeline] Just make any kind of ordinary,
normal gesture that feels natural to you.


1069
01:09:47.235 --> 01:09:49.335
- Pretend nobody else is here.
- Just...


1070
01:09:49.337 --> 01:09:51.340
- [laughs]
- [all laughing]


1071
01:09:52.707 --> 01:09:55.409
- Can I touch my purse?
- Sure.


1072
01:09:55.411 --> 01:09:57.313
- Okay.
- [all] Okay.


1073
01:10:09.358 --> 01:10:11.226
- [chuckles]
- [all chuckling]


1074
01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.897
[Evangeline] Great.

1075
01:10:15.797 --> 01:10:19.501
See how relaxed that was, everyone?
Just that relaxed gesture.


1076
01:10:22.238 --> 01:10:23.439
[chuckling]

1077
01:10:29.010 --> 01:10:31.010
- Nice.
- [chuckles]


1078
01:10:31.012 --> 01:10:32.916
But what kind of, like...?

1079
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:36.886
- Because I did that.
- Yes. Okay.


1080
01:10:37.853 --> 01:10:39.389
Uh...

1081
01:10:43.992 --> 01:10:48.462
- That does always come... [laughing]
- [laughing]


1082
01:10:48.464 --> 01:10:51.967
[Evangeline] That was so great. Thank you.
That was fantastic.


1083
01:11:14.989 --> 01:11:17.490
[chattering]

1084
01:11:17.492 --> 01:11:19.358
[woman] Hey, we're
gonna clown your mom,


1085
01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:21.628
so just copy her walk
and gestures and stuff.


1086
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:23.864
- You can sit down if you want.
- Okay.


1087
01:11:23.866 --> 01:11:27.066
Just go one at a time.
Do you want to go next?


1088
01:11:27.068 --> 01:11:29.705
[laughing]

1089
01:11:35.778 --> 01:11:37.614
[chuckling]

1090
01:12:05.474 --> 01:12:09.645
You really shouldn't use hand sanitizer
like that. It dries out your skin.


1091
01:12:13.015 --> 01:12:15.581
Oh, what sweater
should I wear?


1092
01:12:15.583 --> 01:12:17.983
The one with floral
or the one with floral?


1093
01:12:17.985 --> 01:12:21.291
[laughing]

1094
01:12:30.032 --> 01:12:32.432
The mood swings.

1095
01:12:32.434 --> 01:12:34.904
They can be so bad
sometimes.


1096
01:12:36.705 --> 01:12:39.705
High, low. You never know
where you're gonna go.


1097
01:12:39.707 --> 01:12:43.312
[chuckles]
Throwing things, hitting me.


1098
01:12:45.147 --> 01:12:48.382
But I love you
no matter what


1099
01:12:48.384 --> 01:12:50.483
because you're my daughter.

1100
01:12:50.485 --> 01:12:52.651
Were you smoking?

1101
01:12:52.653 --> 01:12:56.958
I can smell it on you! Go take
a shower, for Christ's sakes.


1102
01:13:00.962 --> 01:13:03.933
Do you want
some pancakes?


1103
01:13:05.934 --> 01:13:07.670
Pancakes!

1104
01:13:09.404 --> 01:13:13.639
I know you hate butter.

1105
01:13:13.641 --> 01:13:17.546
Yes.
Will you eat anything?


1106
01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.480
Anything?

1107
01:13:20.482 --> 01:13:22.915
See, Damon eats.

1108
01:13:22.917 --> 01:13:29.054
Damon fucking eats.
And he keeps it in.


1109
01:13:29.056 --> 01:13:31.958
You're not going
to rehearsal on Friday


1110
01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.131
if you don't eat
these pancakes.


1111
01:13:37.131 --> 01:13:40.032
When you were a...
just a little baby,


1112
01:13:40.034 --> 01:13:42.471
I stroked your head
so soft.


1113
01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:49.479
I-I... I said to myself... I said,
"This baby, she's so perfect.


1114
01:13:52.547 --> 01:13:54.649
She's gonna be so strong."

1115
01:13:57.685 --> 01:14:00.187
And look at you now.

1116
01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:02.558
You are sick.

1117
01:14:03.859 --> 01:14:06.596
You are so sick that you...

1118
01:14:07.996 --> 01:14:10.530
No, Madeline.

1119
01:14:10.532 --> 01:14:12.531
Madeline, no.

1120
01:14:12.533 --> 01:14:15.168
Madeline,
you're scaring me.


1121
01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:18.103
[sobbing]

1122
01:14:18.105 --> 01:14:21.874
Damon, tell her to...
Put it down!


1123
01:14:21.876 --> 01:14:24.244
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!


1124
01:14:24.246 --> 01:14:27.848
My hand! My hand!

1125
01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:32.017
[screaming]

1126
01:14:32.019 --> 01:14:35.590
[crying]

1127
01:14:40.662 --> 01:14:41.964
[sniffles]

1128
01:14:51.038 --> 01:14:52.809
[Evangeline] Wow.

1129
01:14:56.778 --> 01:14:58.147
[sniffles]

1130
01:15:04.952 --> 01:15:07.219
[Evangeline exhales slowly]

1131
01:15:07.221 --> 01:15:09.255
Wow.

1132
01:15:09.257 --> 01:15:12.157
Oh, my God.

1133
01:15:12.159 --> 01:15:14.997
Oh, my God.
That was so great.


1134
01:15:16.532 --> 01:15:19.902
That was so amazing.

1135
01:15:21.002 --> 01:15:24.236
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Yes.


1136
01:15:24.238 --> 01:15:27.307
You're so good.
That was amazing.


1137
01:15:27.309 --> 01:15:31.311
Did you guys see that?
Oh, my God. That was amazing.


1138
01:15:31.313 --> 01:15:33.746
Wow.

1139
01:15:33.748 --> 01:15:35.749
Oh!

1140
01:15:35.751 --> 01:15:37.820
Wow. I, uh...

1141
01:15:41.323 --> 01:15:45.828
This... This is the play.
This is immersive theater.


1142
01:15:46.694 --> 01:15:49.232
[gasps] Wow.

1143
01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.767
Okay.

1144
01:15:53.769 --> 01:15:55.869
Okay. [laughing]

1145
01:15:55.871 --> 01:15:58.638
I was thinking we were
gonna do something else,


1146
01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:03.309
but I think that, in light
of this powerful new work,


1147
01:16:03.311 --> 01:16:06.745
we should, uh...

1148
01:16:06.747 --> 01:16:12.251
Let's everybody pick a piece, just a section
of the improv that Madeline just did,


1149
01:16:12.253 --> 01:16:16.121
and then we will make a dance.

1150
01:16:16.123 --> 01:16:18.325
Make a dance of it and, um...

1151
01:16:18.327 --> 01:16:22.161
When you talk about this
being the play,


1152
01:16:22.163 --> 01:16:24.000
is this about Madeline?

1153
01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:27.733
Well, no, no.

1154
01:16:27.735 --> 01:16:31.170
I mean, it's about a character
that we've been work...


1155
01:16:31.172 --> 01:16:33.373
you know, creating
together called Zia.


1156
01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:36.809
- It's about a character.
- And it's Madeline's story.


1157
01:16:36.811 --> 01:16:39.012
No, Zia.

1158
01:16:39.014 --> 01:16:40.879
- Her name is Zia.
- Zia.


1159
01:16:40.881 --> 01:16:43.916
And she's comfortable with that.
You're comfortable with that?


1160
01:16:43.918 --> 01:16:48.221
- [phone buzzing]
- With us telling your story?


1161
01:16:48.223 --> 01:16:50.322
- [buzzing continues]
- I mean...


1162
01:16:50.324 --> 01:16:55.762
So you're going to tell the story
of the inside of her brain.


1163
01:16:55.764 --> 01:16:58.167
[buzzing continues]

1164
01:17:02.037 --> 01:17:03.039
Yes.

1165
01:17:04.072 --> 01:17:05.641
Okay.

1166
01:17:06.341 --> 01:17:07.777
What?

1167
01:17:09.077 --> 01:17:10.943
You know, I'm just saying.

1168
01:17:10.945 --> 01:17:14.914
I mean, you, right?

1169
01:17:14.916 --> 01:17:16.650
And her.

1170
01:17:16.652 --> 01:17:19.251
- I mean, just, like, think about the optics of...
- I... Yes.


1171
01:17:19.253 --> 01:17:21.254
It's her story.
It's also my story.


1172
01:17:21.256 --> 01:17:23.593
It's everyone
in this room's story.


1173
01:17:29.965 --> 01:17:31.867
[phone buzzing]

1174
01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:41.840
We could keep talking, but I think
we could put it in the work.


1175
01:17:41.842 --> 01:17:43.677
Okay?

1176
01:17:43.679 --> 01:17:45.344
- So, I think we have about 20 minutes.
- [sneezes]


1177
01:17:45.346 --> 01:17:47.813
- Bless you.
- I'm so sorry.


1178
01:17:47.815 --> 01:17:49.315
- Excuse me.
- It's okay.


1179
01:17:49.317 --> 01:17:51.351
- I'm sorry.
- We have about 20 minutes? Twenty minutes?


1180
01:17:51.353 --> 01:17:53.385
- Yeah, we have 20 minutes.
- About 20 minutes.


1181
01:17:53.387 --> 01:17:56.923
Get together in groups of three, and, uh...
and we'll reconvene.


1182
01:17:56.925 --> 01:17:58.458
- [phone buzzing]
- Okay?


1183
01:17:58.460 --> 01:17:59.996
This is...

1184
01:18:01.095 --> 01:18:03.163
Sorry, I have to take this.

1185
01:18:03.165 --> 01:18:04.699
Okay.

1186
01:18:12.274 --> 01:18:13.909
Yeah, so we should, um...

1187
01:18:17.479 --> 01:18:19.713
[Evangeline] Yeah, no, I
just wanted to tell you...


1188
01:18:19.715 --> 01:18:21.915
- Um...
- Sorry. I know I'm supposed to meet you there,


1189
01:18:21.917 --> 01:18:24.284
but I
-I'm still here.

1190
01:18:24.286 --> 01:18:27.419
I just... Yeah, uh...

1191
01:18:27.421 --> 01:18:29.257
Does anyone want
to join our group?


1192
01:18:35.229 --> 01:18:37.132
How you doing?

1193
01:18:43.738 --> 01:18:47.143
[Evangeline chatters, faint]

1194

[woman exhales]

- [man] Hmm.


1196
01:18:53.881 --> 01:18:56.982
[various members] Hmm.

[humming continues]

1200
01:19:14.536 --> 01:19:16.535
I know you feel
it's urgent.


1201
01:19:16.537 --> 01:19:18.772
It's not urgent.

1202
