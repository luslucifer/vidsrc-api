Jesus, expensive little fuckers.

162
00:10:05.636 --> 00:10:08.569
And I thought the three of us
could make s'mores tonight.


163
00:10:08.702 --> 00:10:09.669
I love you.

164
00:10:09.803 --> 00:10:12.335
Aw, I love you s'mores.

165
00:10:12.469 --> 00:10:17.302
Mrs. Corn-Corny corn Paul
came to town.


166
00:10:19.068 --> 00:10:20.636
Oh, this is gonna be good.

167
00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:22.569
Taylor is gonna love it here.

168
00:10:22.702 --> 00:10:24.502
There's a swing set!

169
00:10:24.636 --> 00:10:26.335
Yeah, look at that.

170
00:10:26.469 --> 00:10:29.002
And look, there's even got
some motorboats out here.


171
00:10:29.135 --> 00:10:31.202
Oh, I don't know
if that's a good idea.


172
00:10:31.335 --> 00:10:34.836
You remember that dinner cruise
we took on that boat?


173
00:10:34.968 --> 00:10:38.169
- Oh, God.
- You know, she projectile vomited all over that one.


174
00:10:38.302 --> 00:10:41.769
Oh, God, I'd forgotten
all about that, Jesus Christ.


175
00:10:41.903 --> 00:10:45.302
[Wendy]
That woman's face! Oh!


176
00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:47.968
Christ, that was like something
out of <i>The Exorcist.</i>


177
00:10:48.102 --> 00:10:49.469
- It was.
- [both laughing]


178
00:10:49.602 --> 00:10:50.935
That woman's face.

179
00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:52.702
Oh, shit.

180
00:10:54.602 --> 00:10:56.536
- Hey, Lucky. No, no, no.
- Hey, Lucky!


181
00:10:56.669 --> 00:10:59.002
- What the hell are you doing out?
- No, no, no, honey. You can't.


182
00:10:59.135 --> 00:11:01.602
Honey, Taylor, you can't leave
Lucky outside, babe!


183
00:11:01.736 --> 00:11:03.436
He's gotta be on the leash!

184
00:11:03.569 --> 00:11:07.202
Sweets, that old man
is gonna get so mad!


185
00:11:10.402 --> 00:11:12.869
Come on, kitten,
it's getting cold out here!


186
00:11:13.035 --> 00:11:14.702
We're gonna go
if we're gonna go!


187
00:11:14.836 --> 00:11:16.269
All right.

188
00:11:16.402 --> 00:11:19.135
I am gonna make lunch
while you guys are out fishing.


189
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:20.803
How long do you think
you're gonna be?


190
00:11:20.935 --> 00:11:22.869
I think we're gonna be
maybe an hour,


191
00:11:23.002 --> 00:11:23.968
something like that.

192
00:11:24.102 --> 00:11:25.035
- Yeah.
- You know.


193
00:11:25.169 --> 00:11:27.202
[Paul]
Come on, Tay!


194
00:11:30.636 --> 00:11:32.536
Taylor!

195
00:11:32.669 --> 00:11:35.335
I hope she didn't get locked
in the bathroom again.


196
00:11:35.469 --> 00:11:36.636
Hey, Taylor!

197
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:38.702
Taylor, honey!

198
00:11:46.469 --> 00:11:48.636
- She's not in there.
- Huh?


199
00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:50.436
- Paul.
- What?


200
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:51.968
She's not in there.

201
00:11:52.102 --> 00:11:54.536
Wendy... she has to be.

202
00:11:54.669 --> 00:11:55.869
Taylor!

203
00:11:56.002 --> 00:11:57.202
She's not.

204
00:11:57.335 --> 00:12:00.436
- Taylor!
- No, no, hey, hey, hey.


205
00:12:00.569 --> 00:12:01.803
I'll find her.

206
00:12:01.935 --> 00:12:03.636
Hey, Taylor!

207
00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:05.935
Taylor!

208
00:12:06.903 --> 00:12:08.569
What?

209
00:12:08.702 --> 00:12:09.968
Hey!

210
00:12:11.068 --> 00:12:13.903
- She's...
- Paul, she's not in there.


211
00:12:14.035 --> 00:12:16.335
Did she come out when I went up
to the office?


212
00:12:16.469 --> 00:12:17.669
I don't know.

213
00:12:17.803 --> 00:12:21.102
I mean I was on the other side
of the RV, I...


214
00:12:21.235 --> 00:12:24.002
- Taylor!
- I didn't hear her come out.


215
00:12:24.135 --> 00:12:26.669
[Wendy]
Taylor!


216
00:12:26.803 --> 00:12:29.402
[dramatic music]

217
00:12:30.469 --> 00:12:32.202
She's probably just hiding,
right?


218
00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.536
- Oh, hiding, huh?
- She couldn't have gone far.


219
00:12:34.669 --> 00:12:37.002
If she's hiding,
she's gonna be in big trouble.


220
00:12:37.135 --> 00:12:38.669
Here, here, the outhouse.

221
00:12:38.803 --> 00:12:40.569
Taylor!

222
00:12:42.135 --> 00:12:43.369
[Paul]
Taylor!


223
00:12:43.502 --> 00:12:45.002
Taylor!

224
00:12:46.002 --> 00:12:47.836
Paul?

225
00:12:47.968 --> 00:12:50.102
[tense music]

226
00:12:57.669 --> 00:12:59.536
Where is she?

227
00:13:00.369 --> 00:13:03.169
She's... She's gotta be...

228
00:13:03.935 --> 00:13:05.602
here somewhere.

229
00:13:05.736 --> 00:13:08.569
- Where could she go?
- Taylor!


230
00:13:09.636 --> 00:13:12.002
- Check...
- Taylor!


231
00:13:12.836 --> 00:13:14.669
She's gotta be close by.

232
00:13:14.803 --> 00:13:16.702
Taylor!

233
00:13:18.469 --> 00:13:19.502
Taylor!

234
00:13:19.636 --> 00:13:20.569
[tense music]

235
00:13:20.702 --> 00:13:22.302
Hey, Tay!

236
00:13:24.135 --> 00:13:27.502
[Wendy]
Taylor, come out!


237
00:13:27.636 --> 00:13:29.402
[Paul]
Taylor!


238
00:13:31.002 --> 00:13:32.836
[Wendy]
Taylor!


239
00:13:32.968 --> 00:13:35.903
[suspenseful music]

240
00:13:36.035 --> 00:13:38.169
[people chattering]

241
00:13:43.068 --> 00:13:46.602
- We got a little girl...
- They already filled me in before on the ride over.


242
00:13:46.736 --> 00:13:49.135
Let's go the south
and west end of the lake.


243
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:51.469
They're ringing on the phone
for Franklin County,


244
00:13:51.602 --> 00:13:53.169
- see if we get a helicopter.
- Done.


245
00:13:53.302 --> 00:13:55.436
Any word on that runner?

246
00:13:55.569 --> 00:13:58.135
Found his blood in the woods
a few miles from the prison.


247
00:13:58.269 --> 00:14:00.968
- Suspect he's wounded.
- Good, slow him down.


248
00:14:01.102 --> 00:14:02.235
All right, anything else?

249
00:14:02.369 --> 00:14:04.035
FBI called about the convict.

250
00:14:04.169 --> 00:14:06.502
Told him about the girl,
he asked if we needed help.


251
00:14:06.636 --> 00:14:09.436
Yeah, well you tell him
I got it covered.


252
00:14:09.569 --> 00:14:11.736
- Parents?
- Yep.


253
00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:13.402
Not a word to them
about the prisoner


254
00:14:13.536 --> 00:14:15.369
till we get any updates,
all right?


255
00:14:15.502 --> 00:14:16.736
They already know.

256
00:14:16.869 --> 00:14:18.669
Well, shit.

257
00:14:22.935 --> 00:14:26.002
Mr. Michaelson, Mrs. Michaelson,

258
00:14:26.135 --> 00:14:27.469
Sheriff Baker.

259
00:14:27.602 --> 00:14:29.402
I'm gonna be running
the investigation.


260
00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:31.836
Do you think the prisoner
had anything to do with this?


261
00:14:31.968 --> 00:14:33.602
Well, I can see why
you'd be concerned,


262
00:14:33.736 --> 00:14:36.436
but the last thing that a runner
that's been shot is gonna want


263
00:14:36.569 --> 00:14:37.968
is to pick up a kid
and slow him down.


264
00:14:38.102 --> 00:14:39.702
He was shot?

265
00:14:39.836 --> 00:14:41.536
- Yeah.
- [sighs]


266
00:14:41.669 --> 00:14:46.068
I promise, I'll always be as
transparent and as honest as I can be.


267
00:14:46.202 --> 00:14:47.803
You got a partner here.

268
00:14:47.935 --> 00:14:49.869
We'll get through this.

269
00:14:50.002 --> 00:14:52.269
We'll find her, together.

270
00:14:52.402 --> 00:14:53.502
Yeah.

271
00:14:53.636 --> 00:14:55.536
Mind if I sit down?

272
00:14:55.669 --> 00:14:57.702
Yeah, sure.

273
00:15:00.702 --> 00:15:04.536
I know it's hard,
but if you can try to remember.


274
00:15:05.669 --> 00:15:08.335
Now I know Mrs. Michaelson
was at the store,


275
00:15:08.469 --> 00:15:12.169
and Mr. Michaelson, I heard
you were on the other side,


276
00:15:12.302 --> 00:15:13.869
hooking up the RV,
is that right?


277
00:15:14.002 --> 00:15:16.335
- Yeah.
- You remember hearing anything?


278
00:15:16.469 --> 00:15:17.602
No.

279
00:15:17.736 --> 00:15:19.269
A door maybe, footsteps?

280
00:15:19.402 --> 00:15:20.869
- [Paul] Nothing.
- A voice, cries?


281
00:15:21.002 --> 00:15:22.436
I was on the other side
of the RV,


282
00:15:22.569 --> 00:15:26.068
I'm hooking it up,
I get my fishing poles,


283
00:15:26.202 --> 00:15:30.269
turn around,
I see another camper.


284
00:15:30.402 --> 00:15:33.935
And that would be
Miss Miranda Hudson.


285
00:15:34.068 --> 00:15:35.968
- I guess, yeah.
- She gave us a statement.


286
00:15:36.102 --> 00:15:39.402
She said her and her husband are traveling
across country for a couple weeks.


287
00:15:39.536 --> 00:15:42.035
Well, I didn't see him, I mean,

288
00:15:42.169 --> 00:15:43.869
did he see anything?

289
00:15:44.002 --> 00:15:45.602
He said he was in his RV
watching TV.


290
00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:49.235
What about anybody else?
Did anybody else see anything?


291
00:15:49.369 --> 00:15:51.803
We don't get many visits up here
in the winter.


292
00:15:51.935 --> 00:15:54.736
It's a bit a ways,
as you can see.


293
00:15:54.869 --> 00:15:58.968
Other than Mr. And Mrs. Hudson
and the owner, Tom Henry,


294
00:15:59.102 --> 00:16:02.968
and groundskeeper
named Justin Knowles.


295
00:16:04.135 --> 00:16:05.702
He was there.

296
00:16:05.836 --> 00:16:07.169
He was right there, I seen him.

297
00:16:07.302 --> 00:16:11.369
He drove by right here
on his Gator, thing.


298
00:16:11.502 --> 00:16:15.035
He was, shit, it was just
right after the disappearance.


299
00:16:15.169 --> 00:16:16.836
I mean, do...

300
00:16:16.968 --> 00:16:19.135
Well, we questioned both,

301
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:22.135
and Tom says the last time he
saw was when you pulled in.


302
00:16:22.836 --> 00:16:24.602
They could have lied.

303
00:16:25.602 --> 00:16:26.869
We don't know them.

304
00:16:27.002 --> 00:16:29.903
Look, there is no evidence
of foul play here.


305
00:16:30.035 --> 00:16:32.669
All right.
That being said,


306
00:16:32.803 --> 00:16:36.269
I've asked that no one leave
until we further investigate.


307
00:16:36.402 --> 00:16:39.935
Now Mr. Henry and Mr. Knowles, they live
on the property, that's not a problem.


308
00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:46.135
But I have no legal right to
detain the Hudsons without cause.


309
00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:47.869
No, of course not.

310
00:16:48.002 --> 00:16:51.769
But they have offered to stay a while.
Help with your daughter.


311
00:16:51.903 --> 00:16:54.935
The only advice I can give you
is stay as calm as you can.


312
00:16:55.068 --> 00:16:57.602
Most of the time
these kids just wander away.


313
00:16:57.736 --> 00:17:01.536
How long do you think she's gonna survive
in the woods having just wandered off?


314
00:17:01.669 --> 00:17:04.502
We're bringing in a mobile unit.
We're gonna tape off all the area.


315
00:17:04.636 --> 00:17:07.335
We're gonna have search teams
working all through the night.


316
00:17:07.469 --> 00:17:10.436
Okay? I want you two to stay
here in case she comes back.

with you, and I will.

he's armed and he's dangerous.

he has your daughter, I don't.

I'll have the team call you
and let you know right away.

Wait, I don't understand.

481
00:28:46.068 --> 00:28:47.903
You found a camper...

482
00:28:48.035 --> 00:28:49.235
Survivor.

483
00:28:49.369 --> 00:28:51.469
He was a survival weekend guys.

484
00:28:51.602 --> 00:28:53.302
They come up here
from time to time,


485
00:28:53.436 --> 00:28:57.068
to just spend the weekend trying
to survive off the land.


486
00:28:57.202 --> 00:28:59.102
Sometimes a little longer.

487
00:29:00.302 --> 00:29:01.869
[Paul]
Uh-huh.


488
00:29:02.002 --> 00:29:07.035
So, do you think there's some
kind of connection between...


489
00:29:07.169 --> 00:29:09.436
Right now, we're treating it
as two separate cases.


490
00:29:09.569 --> 00:29:11.202
That's the best way
to go about it.


491
00:29:11.335 --> 00:29:13.968
There's no indication
there is any connection.


492
00:29:14.102 --> 00:29:17.436
Your daughter's out there,
we're gonna find her.


493
00:29:17.569 --> 00:29:19.102
Sure.

494
00:29:19.235 --> 00:29:21.436
Yeah, I mean, what else, yeah.

495
00:29:21.569 --> 00:29:24.669
I'm gonna need you to come down
to the station.


496
00:29:24.803 --> 00:29:27.669
Okay. Well, what for, why?

497
00:29:27.803 --> 00:29:31.269
Well, we need to file a
official missing person report.


498
00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:33.102
It's been over 24 hours now.

499
00:29:33.235 --> 00:29:36.102
Bring some pictures,
some videos.


500
00:29:36.235 --> 00:29:38.636
Anything you think might help.

501
00:29:40.035 --> 00:29:41.602
Sure.

502
00:29:41.736 --> 00:29:43.269
We'll be there.

503
00:29:44.169 --> 00:29:45.702
We'll be there.

...take a search party around
the other side of the lake.


506
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:56.702
[Wendy] What have I done?
What have I done?


507
00:29:56.836 --> 00:29:59.402
What have I done?
I killed a man. I killed a man.


508
00:29:59.536 --> 00:30:02.469
I killed... I killed an innocent man.
Oh, my God, I killed...


509
00:30:02.602 --> 00:30:05.035
There's nothing we can do
about that, you hear me?


510
00:30:05.169 --> 00:30:06.702
I killed an innocent man.

511
00:30:06.836 --> 00:30:09.002
Taylor is missing.

512
00:30:09.135 --> 00:30:11.803
We need to focus on that, okay?

513
00:30:11.935 --> 00:30:16.335
Hey, hey,
it was an accident, okay?


514
00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:25.436
I, uh... I'm real sorry to hear
about your daughter.


515
00:30:25.569 --> 00:30:28.135
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

516
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:31.402
I'm Justin.
I take care of this place.


517
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:36.602
- Justin, I'm Paul.
- Paul.


518
00:30:36.736 --> 00:30:38.469
This is my wife, Wendy.

519
00:30:40.235 --> 00:30:42.502
You guys must be pretty bummed.

520
00:30:42.636 --> 00:30:45.302
I mean, the cops asked me
if I saw anything weird


521
00:30:45.436 --> 00:30:48.002
and I was just dumping trash
in the Gator, you know.


522
00:30:48.135 --> 00:30:51.935
I didn't see nothing. It was just like...
It's like any other day, you know?


523
00:30:52.068 --> 00:30:53.968
Thanks.

524
00:30:54.702 --> 00:30:56.402
How old was she?

525
00:30:57.602 --> 00:30:59.169
Ten.

526
00:31:03.702 --> 00:31:04.935
Why?

527
00:31:06.469 --> 00:31:09.035
Why did you ask how old she was?

528
00:31:09.169 --> 00:31:10.602
Why did you say "was"?

529
00:31:10.736 --> 00:31:13.335
He said "How old was she?"
Is that what he just asked?


530
00:31:13.469 --> 00:31:16.002
- How old was my daughter?
- No, no, I didn't mean that.


531
00:31:16.135 --> 00:31:18.068
I was just thinking, um...

532
00:31:18.202 --> 00:31:19.968
I don't know why I said that.

533
00:31:20.102 --> 00:31:21.669
All right, thank you, Justin.

534
00:31:21.803 --> 00:31:24.202
Okay, anyway, if you guys
need anything or whatever,


535
00:31:24.335 --> 00:31:27.335
I'm in my trailer at site four
just around there, all right.


536
00:31:28.869 --> 00:31:30.369
Okay.

537
00:31:30.502 --> 00:31:33.269
I heard about the dead camper,
that's pretty fucked.

[Wendy]
What is going on?


544
00:32:57.235 --> 00:32:59.369
What... What's happening?

545
00:32:59.502 --> 00:33:02.636
Yeah, we come to fill out
a missing persons report, okay,


546
00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:06.102
- but I feel like you guys are treating us like criminals here.
- Yeah, yeah.


547
00:33:06.235 --> 00:33:07.736
Standard procedure I'm afraid.

548
00:33:07.869 --> 00:33:09.002
I know it doesn't
feel very good.


549
00:33:09.135 --> 00:33:11.068
Feel very good?
It's just...


550
00:33:11.202 --> 00:33:12.636
isn't this wasting time?

551
00:33:12.769 --> 00:33:15.335
- I mean, this time here...
- We're combing the lake.


552
00:33:15.469 --> 00:33:17.602
There's a lot of land to cover.
We'll get it done.


553
00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:20.836
- Tell us how this gets our daughter back?
- Yeah.


554
00:33:20.968 --> 00:33:22.302
I wanna get her face out there.

555
00:33:22.436 --> 00:33:24.569
The more eyes looking for her,
the better.


556
00:33:24.702 --> 00:33:26.135
And better it come from you.

557
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:28.769
People tend to listen
a bit more that way.


558
00:33:28.903 --> 00:33:31.002
What... What are you
talking about?


559
00:33:31.135 --> 00:33:32.369
Press conference.

560
00:33:32.502 --> 00:33:35.536
Jeffrey Michaelson,
that your father?


561
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:36.803
My brother.

562
00:33:36.935 --> 00:33:38.202
All right.

563
00:33:38.335 --> 00:33:40.035
Might wanna give
your family a call,


564
00:33:40.169 --> 00:33:41.935
let 'em know what's going on.

565
00:33:42.803 --> 00:33:44.035
Oh.

566
00:33:44.169 --> 00:33:45.869
[tense music]

567
00:33:46.002 --> 00:33:47.569
At this time,
we have no indications


568
00:33:47.702 --> 00:33:49.369
that Taylor Michaelson
has been kidnapped


569
00:33:49.502 --> 00:33:51.102
or that there is any foul play.

570
00:33:51.235 --> 00:33:53.068
The homicide in the woods
is a separate case


571
00:33:53.202 --> 00:33:55.035
until we find a connection
that says otherwise.


572
00:33:55.169 --> 00:33:57.135
If you are part of a fire
or a police reserve


573
00:33:57.269 --> 00:34:00.369
and would like to volunteer to join
the search, please contact my office.


574
00:34:00.502 --> 00:34:02.169
The Michaelsons would like
to make a statement.

[camera shutters clicking]

We pray to God
that our daughter, Taylor,


577
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:08.135
comes back to us unharmed.

to get my daughter back.</i>

Listen, Wendy and I are having
a little trouble with Taylor.

00:34:30.803 --> 00:34:32.536
So...

586
00:34:34.968 --> 00:34:38.269
[sighs]
So give me a call, okay.

Hi, sorry.

00:35:12.903 --> 00:35:15.202
I hope we're not interrupting.

595
00:35:15.335 --> 00:35:16.903
We thought maybe you guys
might be hungry,


596
00:35:17.035 --> 00:35:19.002
so we brought you some dinner.

597
00:35:19.135 --> 00:35:20.869
- Wow.
- I'm Eric.


598
00:35:21.002 --> 00:35:23.469
- Hi.
- You've already met my wife, Miranda.

00:35:23.602 --> 00:35:26.536
Yep. Yep.

00:35:27.436 --> 00:35:29.269
Thanks. Wendy.
I'm Wendy. Hi.


601
00:35:29.402 --> 00:35:31.269
It's the least we could do.

602
00:35:31.402 --> 00:35:33.602
Feel free to join us
if you want.


603
00:35:33.736 --> 00:35:35.102
Oh, no, thank you.

604
00:35:35.235 --> 00:35:37.302
We don't wanna intrude.

605
00:35:37.436 --> 00:35:40.636
Plus, the police told us that
we could help search tonight.

Hey, hey, quiet!
I'm sorry about that.


610
00:35:47.702 --> 00:35:50.736
That's all right. I'm not really
a big dog person. They can tell.

[Miranda] Look, we can only
imagine how hard this must be.


612

So if there's anything
that you need, we'd...

are you talking about, Wendy?

I'm trying to be a nice guy.

- Nice?
- Yeah.

Nice?

You don't think I saw the way
that you looked at her? Huh?

You don't think that maybe
if you didn't get distracted

- our daughter wouldn't still...
- Okay, stop, stop!

- ...be in this trailer?
- Stop, stop!

Okay, I know what this is about.

632
00:36:44.803 --> 00:36:46.903
All right, don't blame me.

633
00:36:47.068 --> 00:36:50.436
Do you think that's gonna bring
her back? Hmm?


634
00:36:53.169 --> 00:36:55.502
It was a long time ago, Wendy.

635
00:36:55.636 --> 00:36:58.035
I told you
that would never happen again,


636
00:36:58.169 --> 00:36:59.602
and that's what I meant.

[sighs]

638
00:37:01.869 --> 00:37:06.302
Okay, I fucked up!
But don't keep beating me up about it!


639
00:37:06.436 --> 00:37:08.135
Taylor's the only reason
I'm with you!


640
00:37:08.269 --> 00:37:10.035
- Knock it off!
- Taylor's the only reason


641
00:37:10.169 --> 00:37:11.736
- I'm with you!
- Stop it!


642
00:37:11.869 --> 00:37:13.335
- We don't have anything, Paul!
- Shh!


643
00:37:13.469 --> 00:37:15.002
We don't have anything, Paul!

644
00:37:15.135 --> 00:37:16.903
We don't have anything
without Taylor!


645
00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:19.469
What do we have, Paul?
What do we have?


646
00:37:19.602 --> 00:37:22.402
Tell me, what do we have
without our daughter?


647
00:37:22.536 --> 00:37:25.068
We have each other.

648
00:37:25.202 --> 00:37:26.836
Hey, hey, hey.

649
00:37:26.968 --> 00:37:29.769
We have each other.

650
00:37:29.903 --> 00:37:32.135
That's all we have,

651
00:37:32.269 --> 00:37:34.702
and we're gonna
get through this.


652
00:37:37.736 --> 00:37:39.502
Together.

653
00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:44.202
- You and me.
- We'll get through it.

Are you getting anywhere on that
little girl's disappearance?


660
00:38:54.636 --> 00:38:57.335
You can't take it home
with you, John.


661
00:39:00.035 --> 00:39:02.169
It's not fair to me.

We gotta get some sleep.
Come on.

- [grunts]
- You haven't slept in two days.

Oh, I know.

674
00:39:49.135 --> 00:39:52.169
- Come to bed with me.
- No, I can't.


675
00:39:52.302 --> 00:39:54.935
I mean, I want to, but I can't.

676
00:39:55.068 --> 00:39:57.836
I've already taken two Ambien.

677
00:39:57.968 --> 00:40:04.335
My body's so tired,
but I cannot stop my mind from racing.


678
00:40:06.002 --> 00:40:09.135
Eric... Eric told the police

679
00:40:09.269 --> 00:40:13.602
that he was watching TV.
There's no cable here.

Eric.

681
00:40:15.502 --> 00:40:18.536
And Lucky... Lucky was looking
at them. Lucky was barking.


682
00:40:18.669 --> 00:40:20.736
Lucky never barks
at anybody like that.


683
00:40:20.869 --> 00:40:22.469
Why was he barking
at him like that?


684
00:40:22.602 --> 00:40:25.135
- Okay.
- Why?


685
00:40:25.269 --> 00:40:26.536
Why?

686
00:40:26.669 --> 00:40:28.803
Why?

687
00:40:28.935 --> 00:40:30.335
Why do dogs do anything?

688
00:40:30.469 --> 00:40:31.669
Where you going?

00:40:37.736 --> 00:40:38.702
Give me that!

- Hey!

00:40:40.202 --> 00:40:42.536
- What are you doing?
- To tell him what? Ow!


695
00:40:42.669 --> 00:40:44.769
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, but what are you gonna tell him?


696
00:40:44.903 --> 00:40:47.436

You know what, they said that they were
gonna go help with the search party, right?


700
00:40:59.068 --> 00:41:01.169
So maybe we should just...

701
00:41:02.602 --> 00:41:03.935
go look around.

702
00:41:04.068 --> 00:41:05.736
- Give me that.
- What?


703
00:41:05.869 --> 00:41:06.935
That's crazy. Come on.

704
00:41:07.068 --> 00:41:08.669
You and me are going to bed.

That's what we're gonna do.

Now come on.

707
00:41:12.068 --> 00:41:15.968
- What if she's over there?
- Huh?


708
00:41:16.102 --> 00:41:19.903
What if Taylor is over there
tied up?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Prenatal drugs.
That's clomiphene.

IVF injectors,
prenatal vitamins.

They were trying to have a baby.

728
00:43:14.302 --> 00:43:16.002
Okay.

729
00:43:16.135 --> 00:43:18.302
What if they were trying
to have a baby so badly


730
00:43:18.436 --> 00:43:21.269
that they took ours instead?

731
00:43:21.402 --> 00:43:24.135
Or maybe they're just
trying to have a baby.


732

- Come on.
- She said that they were newlyweds.

What?

734
00:43:28.869 --> 00:43:30.469
They're newlyweds.

735

What if Miranda
was distracting you


736
00:43:34.235 --> 00:43:38.469
so that her husband
could take our daughter?


737
00:43:42.369 --> 00:43:45.502
Okay, so,
what'd they do with her?

Man, we were just coming back

to see if you guys
were back yet.

- We were wondering...
- Yeah.


749
00:44:21.202 --> 00:44:23.469
if anybody found anything.

750

Anybody find anything?

751
00:44:25.536 --> 00:44:27.569
No. Uh...

They're still out there.

753

We just came back
'cause she wasn't feeling well.


754
00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:35.536
Yeah, I didn't get much sleep
last night.


755
00:44:35.669 --> 00:44:37.202
Me neither.

756
00:44:39.235 --> 00:44:42.302
Yeah, I'm sure we could all
use a little sleep.


757
00:44:42.436 --> 00:44:46.968
So, you know, it's just been
one of those days.


758
00:44:47.102 --> 00:44:48.935
So let's go.

759
00:44:49.068 --> 00:44:51.369
Good night. Come on, honey.

760
00:44:52.769 --> 00:44:54.636
But, you know, hey, you guys.

761
00:44:54.769 --> 00:44:57.803
You know, Paul and I were thinking
of sneaking one of the fishing boats


762
00:44:57.935 --> 00:45:02.035
out in the morning to search the
lake, but they won't let us search,


763
00:45:02.169 --> 00:45:05.335
but they'd let you,
so maybe if we go together?


764
00:45:06.235 --> 00:45:10.135
- Uh, I...
- Yeah, absolutely.


765
00:45:10.269 --> 00:45:13.702
We'll meet you guys
at the dock at 7 a.m.


766
00:45:13.836 --> 00:45:17.968
Okay, thank you.
Wow.


767
00:45:18.102 --> 00:45:20.235

Are you serious right now?

[thunder rumbling]

800
00:48:15.736 --> 00:48:17.669
[tense music]

801
00:48:32.135 --> 00:48:35.702
Listen, about last night,
I wanted to tell you...


802
00:48:35.836 --> 00:48:38.202
I don't wanna talk about that.

803
00:48:40.135 --> 00:48:42.002
Fine. Uh...

804
00:48:42.135 --> 00:48:43.968
You wanna tell me what
we're doing here?


805
00:48:44.102 --> 00:48:45.669
I thought you didn't even like
these people,


806
00:48:45.803 --> 00:48:48.102
then you wanna invite 'em out
for an afternoon on the lake.


807
00:48:48.235 --> 00:48:51.402
We are getting them alone, gonna get information,
and then we're gonna go to the police.


808
00:48:51.536 --> 00:48:53.636
We can go to the police now
and tell them what we found.


809
00:48:53.769 --> 00:48:56.235
That's a good idea. After we tell
them that we broke into their RV


810
00:48:56.369 --> 00:48:58.202
and searched through
all their belongings,


811
00:48:58.335 --> 00:49:00.836
maybe we can tell them
that I killed a camper too!


812
00:49:01.002 --> 00:49:03.903
- [both] Good morning!
- Good morning.


813
00:49:04.035 --> 00:49:07.135
Thanks for doing this, guys.
We appreciate it.


814
00:49:07.269 --> 00:49:10.102
- [Wendy] Yeah.
- Yeah, no worries.


815
00:49:13.102 --> 00:49:15.502
Okay.
All right.


816
00:49:15.636 --> 00:49:17.502
[clears throat]

817
00:49:18.836 --> 00:49:19.803
[scoffs]

818
00:49:19.935 --> 00:49:21.369
[tense music]

819
00:49:21.502 --> 00:49:22.536
Okay.

820
00:49:26.968 --> 00:49:28.968
[Wendy]
All right.


821
00:49:29.102 --> 00:49:31.369
[Paul]
Get us off the dock here.


822
00:49:31.502 --> 00:49:33.602
Okay.

823
00:49:34.536 --> 00:49:36.269
We're good.

824
00:49:37.803 --> 00:49:39.935
[engine whirring]

825
00:50:34.035 --> 00:50:35.869
[Eric]
Maybe we should head back now.


826
00:50:36.002 --> 00:50:37.702
I think we're almost out of gas.

827
00:50:39.536 --> 00:50:40.836
Hey, wait.

828
00:50:40.968 --> 00:50:43.935
There's something... There's
something floating over there.


829
00:50:44.068 --> 00:50:47.602
Right on the edge of the lake,
look. See?


830
00:50:47.736 --> 00:50:49.402
Oh, yeah, no, I see it.

831
00:50:49.536 --> 00:50:52.968
I mean, it's something...
Something's floating over there.


832
00:50:59.803 --> 00:51:00.903
What is it?

833
00:51:01.035 --> 00:51:02.636
It looks like
a plastic trash bag.


834
00:51:02.769 --> 00:51:05.536
- No.
- Come on, guys. We've been out here six hours,


835
00:51:05.669 --> 00:51:08.469
getting dehydrated. We should head
back, get some food, refuel.


836
00:51:08.602 --> 00:51:10.302
It's just a bag.

837
00:51:13.235 --> 00:51:15.402
We can take a quick look,
all right.


838
00:51:15.536 --> 00:51:18.569
Come on. Come on.

839
00:51:20.135 --> 00:51:22.068
Okay, okay, okay.

840
00:51:25.169 --> 00:51:27.302
[tense music]

841
00:51:53.736 --> 00:51:55.002
[Wendy]
Let me see it.


842
00:51:59.602 --> 00:52:01.169
[Eric]
Go back now?


843
00:52:01.302 --> 00:52:03.502
[Paul]
You wanna open it or...?


844
00:52:05.235 --> 00:52:07.803
- You didn't even wanna look.
- [Eric] Huh?


845
00:52:07.935 --> 00:52:09.803
[Wendy]
He didn't wanna look.


846
00:52:09.935 --> 00:52:11.669
How... How are you so sure?

847
00:52:12.636 --> 00:52:14.869
Well, I wasn't.

848
00:52:15.002 --> 00:52:17.035
But it looked
like a plastic bag,


849
00:52:17.169 --> 00:52:20.436
and it was, so I guess
I was right about that.


850
00:52:22.569 --> 00:52:23.836
Damn it!

851
00:52:23.968 --> 00:52:25.369
We're out of gas.

852
00:52:25.502 --> 00:52:27.102
I was right
about that too. Shit!


853
00:52:27.235 --> 00:52:29.436
Maybe you didn't wanna look

854
00:52:29.569 --> 00:52:33.536
because you were sure
that it wasn't her.


855
00:52:33.669 --> 00:52:34.903
What?

856
00:52:35.035 --> 00:52:36.335
Wendy.

857
00:52:36.469 --> 00:52:38.602
I don't mind asking them
a few questions, okay,


858
00:52:38.736 --> 00:52:40.869
but let's not just start
accusing people...


859
00:52:41.002 --> 00:52:42.702
Wait, wait, wait, questions?

860
00:52:42.836 --> 00:52:44.035
What questions?

861
00:52:44.169 --> 00:52:46.935
For example,
how is the honeymoon going?


862
00:52:48.035 --> 00:52:49.436
Huh?

863
00:52:49.569 --> 00:52:53.002
Look, guys, I don't know
what you're talking about,


864
00:52:53.135 --> 00:52:54.402
but we're stranded out here.

865
00:52:54.536 --> 00:52:56.935
It's gonna take a long time
to row back.


866
00:52:57.068 --> 00:52:59.068
I think what my wife
is trying to say


867
00:52:59.202 --> 00:53:01.502
is that we just find it
a little ironic


868
00:53:01.636 --> 00:53:04.002
that you guys are trying
to have a kid


869
00:53:04.135 --> 00:53:07.436
and our kid goes missing.

870
00:53:07.569 --> 00:53:08.935
How do you know that?

871
00:53:09.569 --> 00:53:10.836
We found the IVF.

872
00:53:10.968 --> 00:53:12.669
If you have her,
just give her back to us.


873
00:53:12.803 --> 00:53:15.335
- You go through our shit?
- We won't say anything, I promise we won't.


874
00:53:15.469 --> 00:53:17.436
We're out here trying to help
and they're fucking accusing us!


875
00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:20.302
Calm down, Eric.
They're obviously going through a lot.


876
00:53:20.436 --> 00:53:23.369
You know, and just think, like,
you guys are newlyweds,


877
00:53:23.502 --> 00:53:25.836
but you've been trying
to have a kid for years.


878
00:53:25.968 --> 00:53:27.669
It just looks a little,
you know.


879
00:53:27.803 --> 00:53:29.569
Don't even answer that question!

880
00:53:29.702 --> 00:53:32.002
I'm gonna row us back myself,

881
00:53:32.135 --> 00:53:34.135
when we get back we're getting
the hell out of here.


882
00:53:34.269 --> 00:53:37.002
Fuck these people!
Get out of my way. Fuck you!


883
00:53:39.169 --> 00:53:40.702
I am so sorry.

884
00:53:41.669 --> 00:53:43.669
- You're not going anywhere.
- Jesus, fuck!


885
00:53:43.803 --> 00:53:45.602
- What?
- No, honey, I'm sorry.


886
00:53:45.736 --> 00:53:47.836
You're not going anywhere.
You're gonna answer a couple of questions.


887
00:53:47.968 --> 00:53:50.436
You better get your wife in
check before someone gets hurt.


888
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:53.035
Wendy, put the gun down.
She's not normally like this.


889
00:53:53.169 --> 00:53:54.769
- She's not a violent person.
- I feel it in my body.


890
00:53:54.903 --> 00:53:57.269
I feel it. I know you can feel it.
They have her.


891
00:53:57.402 --> 00:53:59.068
[Miranda]
What are you talking about?


892
00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:00.869
We never said we were newlyweds.

893
00:54:01.002 --> 00:54:02.502
We've been married
for five years.


894
00:54:02.636 --> 00:54:04.736
We spent all of our money
trying to have a kid


895
00:54:04.869 --> 00:54:06.302
so we decided to take this trip,

896
00:54:06.436 --> 00:54:09.736
just focus on us,
and forget about having kids.


897
00:54:09.869 --> 00:54:12.335
Until you found our daughter

898
00:54:12.469 --> 00:54:14.502
and you thought
that you could have


899
00:54:14.636 --> 00:54:15.903
- one of your own.
- No!


900
00:54:16.035 --> 00:54:18.602
We would never do
something like that.


901
00:54:18.736 --> 00:54:19.968
You are lying.

902
00:54:20.102 --> 00:54:22.903
- This game is over, we're done!
- Paul!


903
00:54:23.035 --> 00:54:24.836
You protecting
your little girlfriend?


904
00:54:24.968 --> 00:54:26.369
[Eric]
What are you talking about?


905
00:54:26.502 --> 00:54:28.135
[Wendy]
You thought I was sleeping?


906
00:54:28.269 --> 00:54:30.968
I watched you.
I watched you watch her.


907
00:54:31.102 --> 00:54:33.035
Oh, you're good.

908
00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:35.803
You like being watched, a lot.

909
00:54:35.935 --> 00:54:38.669
Maybe it's because my husband
could get me pregnant


910
00:54:38.803 --> 00:54:39.935
and hers can't.

911
00:54:40.068 --> 00:54:41.335
- That's enough!
- [Miranda screams]


912
00:54:41.469 --> 00:54:44.536
- [gun fires]
- [tense dramatic music]


913
00:54:44.669 --> 00:54:46.636
[suspenseful music]

914
00:55:07.636 --> 00:55:08.736
[breathing heavily]

915
00:55:08.869 --> 00:55:10.169
Jesus!

916
00:55:10.302 --> 00:55:12.169
Wendy!

917
00:55:12.302 --> 00:55:13.469
Hey!

918
00:55:17.602 --> 00:55:19.235
Hey! Hey!

919
00:55:19.369 --> 00:55:21.903
- Wendy! Wendy!
- [gasps]


920
00:55:22.035 --> 00:55:23.402
God!

921
00:55:23.536 --> 00:55:24.402
You okay?

922
00:55:24.536 --> 00:55:25.669
Hang on to the boat!

923
00:55:25.803 --> 00:55:28.102
Oh, God, you're okay.

924
00:55:28.235 --> 00:55:30.302
Are you okay? Are you okay?

925
00:55:30.436 --> 00:55:32.102
Oh, God.

926
00:55:34.602 --> 00:55:36.602
- Where's Miranda?
- [Wendy] I don't know.


927
00:55:36.736 --> 00:55:38.169
[tense music]

928
00:55:38.302 --> 00:55:39.702
[Wendy]
I don't know.


929
00:55:49.035 --> 00:55:51.903
Okay, let's go, let's go.

930
00:55:52.035 --> 00:55:54.269
Let's go right now.

931
00:56:14.602 --> 00:56:15.569
Got a minute?

932
00:56:15.702 --> 00:56:17.402
Yep.

933
00:56:17.536 --> 00:56:18.569
What is it?

934
00:56:18.702 --> 00:56:20.369
FBI called again.

935
00:56:20.502 --> 00:56:22.736
Not their territory.
This ain't connected yet.


936
00:56:22.869 --> 00:56:25.702
What if it's connected
to the dead camper in the woods?


937
00:56:25.836 --> 00:56:28.269
- No proof of that.
- Look, John...


938
00:56:28.402 --> 00:56:30.068
this isn't looking good,
all right.


939
00:56:30.202 --> 00:56:33.235
I'm just saying,
maybe we can use some help.


940
00:56:34.302 --> 00:56:37.369
Who you working for? Huh?

941
00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:48.169
Rakes, get Tim Bradley
on the phone,


942
00:56:48.302 --> 00:56:51.202
tell him the situation,
get him down here.


943
00:56:55.102 --> 00:56:57.235
[whirring]

944
00:57:02.669 --> 00:57:05.169
Anything you wanna tell me?

945
00:57:07.935 --> 00:57:11.302
Any detail come back in?

946
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:16.068
[sighs]

947
00:57:17.169 --> 00:57:19.202
Every piece
of information matters.


948
00:57:19.335 --> 00:57:20.569
[Wendy]
Sheriff...


949
00:57:22.335 --> 00:57:25.335
we feel so helpless.

950
00:57:28.803 --> 00:57:31.135
Well, there's someone
I'd like you to talk to.


951
00:57:31.269 --> 00:57:33.335
I think he might be able
to help you.


952
00:57:35.035 --> 00:57:37.068
His name is Dr. Bradley.

953
00:57:37.803 --> 00:57:39.702
He's a grief counselor.

954
00:57:42.135 --> 00:57:44.469
We have nothing to grieve.

955
00:57:46.302 --> 00:57:49.402
Taylor is still out there.

956
00:57:50.302 --> 00:57:52.269
You said you would find her.

957
00:57:52.402 --> 00:57:57.369
You said
that you would find her.

960
01:00:12.769 --> 01:00:14.502
You need to come see this.

[Baker]
This mean anything to you?


965
01:01:27.102 --> 01:01:28.636
It's...

966
01:01:30.436 --> 01:01:31.302
it's Taylor's.

967
01:01:31.436 --> 01:01:33.502
It's Taylor's
favorite necklace.


968
01:01:33.636 --> 01:01:35.068
Where did you find it?

969
01:01:35.803 --> 01:01:37.035
Hudson's RV.

970
01:01:37.169 --> 01:01:40.769
Eric Hudson's been stabbed
multiple times.


971
01:01:40.903 --> 01:01:44.869
So at this point, high probability
your daughter's been abducted.


972
01:01:45.002 --> 01:01:48.035
We got an APB out
for his wife, Miranda.


973
01:01:49.369 --> 01:01:51.335
We'll get some answers.

974
01:01:54.869 --> 01:01:56.402
[sighs]

975
01:01:58.636 --> 01:02:00.269
I had lied to you.

976
01:02:01.536 --> 01:02:04.102
I told you
I'd never lost a child.


977
01:02:04.903 --> 01:02:06.369
I lost one.

978
01:02:07.436 --> 01:02:08.968
My son.

979
01:02:09.602 --> 01:02:10.935
A few years back.

980
01:02:11.702 --> 01:02:12.968
Drug addiction.

981
01:02:14.469 --> 01:02:18.102
And it's a pain that no one
should ever go through.


982
01:02:19.436 --> 01:02:22.569
And the reason I can make sure
you don't have to.


983
01:02:23.836 --> 01:02:25.102
My word.

984
01:02:29.502 --> 01:02:30.536
Oh, my...

985
01:02:31.869 --> 01:02:34.903
What are we gonna tell him?
We gotta tell him something!


986
01:02:35.035 --> 01:02:37.202
They're wasting time looking
for Miranda.


987
01:02:37.335 --> 01:02:38.335
Yeah.

988
01:02:38.469 --> 01:02:41.202
They are not gonna find her.
She's dead.


989
01:02:41.335 --> 01:02:43.068
- Shh!
- How are they gonna find her?


990
01:02:43.202 --> 01:02:44.669
We don't know that for sure.

991
01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:47.803
Well, Eric's dead.

992
01:02:47.935 --> 01:02:49.536
Eric's dead.

993
01:02:49.669 --> 01:02:51.636
We are murderers.

994
01:02:51.769 --> 01:02:53.968
No, no, that was an accident.

995
01:02:54.102 --> 01:02:57.903
- No, once is an accident, twice?
- God damn it.


996
01:02:58.035 --> 01:02:59.903
What do you want me
to do, Wendy?


997
01:03:00.035 --> 01:03:04.035
- [sighs] I don't know.
- Fuck, for all we know, they did do it! Right?


998
01:03:04.169 --> 01:03:06.502
- If they did it, where is she?
- I don't know!


999
01:03:06.636 --> 01:03:09.135
- Maybe they took her somewhere!
- Where is Taylor?


1000
01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:11.669
Maybe they had an accomplice.
They hid her, okay.


1001
01:03:11.803 --> 01:03:14.068
Or they gave her to somebody.

1002
01:03:15.736 --> 01:03:18.469
We can't ask them now.

1003
01:03:18.602 --> 01:03:21.935
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

1004

[Lucky whimpering]

[ominous music]

1009
01:03:52.369 --> 01:03:54.968
I saw you talking
to the sheriff.


1010
01:03:56.068 --> 01:03:57.935
- So?
- So?


1011
01:03:58.068 --> 01:04:00.169
Don't play games with me.

1012
01:04:00.302 --> 01:04:02.536
I didn't say anything,
all right?


1013
01:04:05.702 --> 01:04:09.002
- I'm scared, Tom.
- [scoffs] What are you scared of?


1014
01:04:09.135 --> 01:04:10.968
Dead bodies keep popping up
all over.


1015
01:04:11.102 --> 01:04:14.402
I don't like this, Tom,
and I need some answers.


1016
01:04:14.536 --> 01:04:15.935
Like what?

1017
01:04:16.068 --> 01:04:18.102
Did you kill those people?

1018
01:04:18.235 --> 01:04:20.135
I've known you
since you were 14,


1019
01:04:20.269 --> 01:04:23.469
took you in
when no one else wanted you,


1020
01:04:23.602 --> 01:04:25.402
hired you, fed you...

1021
01:04:25.536 --> 01:04:27.736
treated you like a son,
you're gonna ask me that?


1022
01:04:27.869 --> 01:04:31.469
That's what I'm asking you,
Tom, 'cause I know you.


1023
01:04:31.602 --> 01:04:32.935
I know all about you.

1024
01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:34.436
I know everything.

1025
01:04:34.569 --> 01:04:36.803
[sighs]
I didn't kill those people.


1026
01:04:36.935 --> 01:04:39.235
Well, did you take
that little girl?


1027
01:04:41.102 --> 01:04:43.702
Don't you ever insult me
like that again!


1028
01:04:43.836 --> 01:04:45.235
You understand me?

1029
01:04:46.068 --> 01:04:47.335
You understand me?

1030
01:04:47.469 --> 01:04:49.335
Yeah, yeah.

1031
01:04:50.602 --> 01:04:51.669
Here.

1032
01:04:54.068 --> 01:04:56.035
Now get.

any of your shit!

Wendy, I haven't eaten
in three days, okay.


1046
01:05:59.836 --> 01:06:03.169
I haven't slept in three days.

1047

And even if we do get Taylor
back, guess what?


1048

When the police find out
what we did,

we're all going to jail, okay?

1050

So this, right now,
is all we've got.


1051
01:06:22.068 --> 01:06:26.935
[sighs] And I'm not gonna sit
around wasting it by worrying.

All right?

1053
01:06:28.335 --> 01:06:31.536
So please, come sit down.

semblance of a nice, normal night?

I had some...

01:08:54.202 --> 01:08:57.002
I'm sorry,
I already opened the chocolate.


1077
01:09:01.436 --> 01:09:05.102
Be a dollar for the candy bar
plus the videos.


1078
01:09:06.335 --> 01:09:08.968
- I don't have a wallet.
- Of course.


1079
01:09:10.903 --> 01:09:14.769
Write down what you take, time in and
time out, and I'll put it on your bill.


1080
01:09:14.903 --> 01:09:16.569
So generous.

Considering the circumstances.

1082
01:09:18.169 --> 01:09:19.836
Fine, if it'll make
you feel better,


1083
01:09:19.968 --> 01:09:21.502
I won't charge you
for the candy bar,


1084
01:09:21.636 --> 01:09:24.035
but make sure
you bring those back.

Well, that's great.

So we can have a nice,

Yeah, oh, what about this one?

1093
01:10:21.102 --> 01:10:22.836
It's one of Taylor's favorites.

1094
01:10:22.968 --> 01:10:26.369
It's where a daddy fish
loses a baby fish.


1095
01:10:26.502 --> 01:10:30.702
Or, oh, yeah,
I got an action movie about abduction.


1096
01:10:30.836 --> 01:10:33.469
Or... Oh, what about this one?

1097
01:10:33.602 --> 01:10:35.602
This one flew
over the cuckoo's nest.


1098
01:10:35.736 --> 01:10:38.369
That's one you can relate to,
isn't it, Paul?


1099
01:10:38.502 --> 01:10:41.769
Or maybe we could go out
to the campfire


1100
01:10:41.903 --> 01:10:48.402
and finally make those s'mores
you were talking about!


1101
01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:50.002
Enough!

1102

[softly]
Shut up.


1107
01:11:25.968 --> 01:11:27.736
Let's have that glass
of wine, Paul!


1108
01:11:27.869 --> 01:11:29.602
[Paul]
Fuck off!


1109
01:11:31.135 --> 01:11:32.436
[Wendy]
It's pretty good.


1110

What, what, what?

1117
01:11:51.968 --> 01:11:53.302
What are you barking for?

1118
01:11:53.436 --> 01:11:54.269
Come here.

01:12:02.269 --> 01:12:04.736
- I'm sorry to bother you...
- Don't.


1122
01:12:04.869 --> 01:12:08.803
Um, it's a beautiful night.

[thunder rumbling]

1124
01:12:14.402 --> 01:12:18.002
- How are you doing today?
- Peachy.


1125
01:12:18.135 --> 01:12:21.102
Sorry, I'm not too good
at talking to people.


1126
01:12:21.235 --> 01:12:23.369
I seem to say the wrong things.

1127
01:12:23.502 --> 01:12:28.369
I just wanted to say I really
hope you guys find your daughter.


1128
01:12:28.502 --> 01:12:30.736
You know, alive.

Make sure you get a good shot
of those cuts right there.


1161
01:16:57.636 --> 01:17:01.602
I wanna know, what the hell
is going on here, okay?


1162
01:17:01.736 --> 01:17:04.035
Our daughter is still missing.

1163
01:17:04.169 --> 01:17:06.302
You got some dead guy
in the woods over there.


1164
01:17:06.436 --> 01:17:08.335
These guys are either dead
or missing,


1165
01:17:08.469 --> 01:17:12.202
so please, tell me where the
hell everybody was this morning?


1166
01:17:12.335 --> 01:17:14.736
It's Thanksgiving day.

1167
01:17:14.869 --> 01:17:16.669
I pulled these men
from their tables.


1168
01:17:16.803 --> 01:17:20.602
Everyone else we got is out in the
woods looking for your daughter.


1169
01:17:21.869 --> 01:17:24.469
I forgot about that, Jesus.

1170
01:17:24.602 --> 01:17:26.302
How's your wife?

1171
01:17:26.436 --> 01:17:28.269
How the hell do you think
she is, man?


1172
01:17:28.402 --> 01:17:30.669
Somebody murdered our dog!

1173
01:17:30.803 --> 01:17:32.035
You don't know that.

1174
01:17:32.169 --> 01:17:33.436
It could be an animal.

1175
01:17:33.569 --> 01:17:35.202
An animal?

1176
01:17:35.335 --> 01:17:38.935
Listen, last night,
my wife said she saw


1177
01:17:39.068 --> 01:17:41.135
that creepy kid Justin
doing drugs.


1178
01:17:41.269 --> 01:17:45.068
And this morning, I hear him, he's buzzing
all over the campground on his Gator.


1179
01:17:45.202 --> 01:17:49.669
- Drugs, where?
- Doing drugs in that van back there that he lives in, okay.


1180
01:17:49.803 --> 01:17:53.436
He comes to my wife last night, and he
hands her a chocolate bar, all right.


1181
01:17:53.569 --> 01:17:55.536
Acting strange,
stranger than usual.


1182
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:58.202
So, you know, she follows him.
She sees him.


1183
01:17:58.335 --> 01:18:00.302
He's smoking something
out of a glass pipe.


1184
01:18:00.436 --> 01:18:02.636
We'll bring him in,
and we'll talk to him.


1185
01:18:02.769 --> 01:18:05.836
I think it's time for you and Mrs.
Michaelson, maybe you go to a hotel.


1186
01:18:05.968 --> 01:18:09.235
A hotel? We're not going anywhere.
I'm not going anywhere


1187
01:18:09.369 --> 01:18:14.202
until my daughter is back here
with me safely!

You got it.

Forensics found a hair
under Eric Hudson's ring.


1192

Well, their records are clean.

1193
01:18:35.803 --> 01:18:37.636
Find the wife.

1194

Hey, Wendy!

1199
01:18:52.235 --> 01:18:55.602
Wendy, open the door
or I'll break it down!


1200
01:18:57.202 --> 01:19:00.369
Hey, you okay in there?

1201
01:19:02.035 --> 01:19:03.968
Yeah.

1202
01:19:04.102 --> 01:19:06.469
I just need to sleep.

1203

[pills rattling]

1204
01:19:26.035 --> 01:19:29.002
Maybe I should have
a lawyer present.


1205
01:19:29.869 --> 01:19:31.602
Something you need a lawyer for?

1206
01:19:32.769 --> 01:19:35.935
No, I just don't feel
real comfortable right now.


1207
01:19:36.068 --> 01:19:37.869
Well, you're not arrested.

1208
01:19:38.002 --> 01:19:39.602
We're just talking.

1209
01:19:39.736 --> 01:19:41.436
You and me.

1210
01:19:44.335 --> 01:19:45.869
Anything you wanna tell me?

1211
01:19:46.002 --> 01:19:48.369
I don't know nothing.

1212
01:19:48.502 --> 01:19:50.569
Don't know nothing
about that dog?


1213
01:19:50.702 --> 01:19:52.135
What dog?

1214
01:19:53.502 --> 01:19:56.569
Okay, okay.

1215
01:19:56.702 --> 01:19:58.935
Well I know some things.

1216

That your mama left you
when you were 10.


1217
01:20:02.402 --> 01:20:04.602
You never knew your daddy.

In and out of juvie for years
and years, drugs.

Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.

1221
01:20:25.135 --> 01:20:29.469
I got a warrant for that van of
yours, what do you think I'd find?


1222
01:20:29.602 --> 01:20:32.803
- Drugs.
- I don't do drugs anymore. I'm clean.


1223
01:20:32.935 --> 01:20:36.035
- You're lying. You're lying, Justin.
- I don't. No, I'm not.


1224
01:20:36.169 --> 01:20:38.402
Drugs make you lie.
That's what they do.


1225
01:20:38.536 --> 01:20:41.068
They keep you
from being yourself.


1226
01:20:41.202 --> 01:20:43.903
Make you do things
you normally wouldn't do.


1227
01:20:44.035 --> 01:20:45.335
All right?

1228
01:20:49.935 --> 01:20:52.469
My son was an addict.

1229
01:20:52.602 --> 01:20:54.002
I didn't even know it.

1230
01:20:54.135 --> 01:20:55.935
That's how good a liar he was.

1231
01:20:57.736 --> 01:21:01.068
Time I found out, it's too late.

1232
01:21:02.302 --> 01:21:03.803
I don't want that for you.

1233
01:21:03.935 --> 01:21:05.935
I'm here to help you.

1234
01:21:06.068 --> 01:21:08.436
But I need you to help me first.

1235
01:21:08.569 --> 01:21:13.135
Now what happened
to the little girl?


1236
01:21:13.269 --> 01:21:15.469
- Yeah, you know something.
- No I don't. No I don't.


1237
01:21:15.602 --> 01:21:18.002
Whether you saw, whether you
overheard something.


1238
01:21:18.135 --> 01:21:20.636
You were all around there.
Come on, now.


1239
01:21:20.769 --> 01:21:23.235
What, you're trying
to protect someone? Is that it?


1240
01:21:23.369 --> 01:21:26.602
Miranda Hudson, is that it? Huh?

1241
01:21:27.369 --> 01:21:28.636
Mr. Henry?

1242
01:21:28.769 --> 01:21:32.102
I told you... I told you,
I don't know nothing, all right?


1243
01:21:32.235 --> 01:21:33.736
I don't know nothing.

1244
01:21:33.869 --> 01:21:36.869
You don't know nothing about
those two dead people neither?


1245
01:21:37.002 --> 01:21:39.035
No, no.

1246
01:21:39.169 --> 01:21:41.135
Well, let me let you in
on a little secret.


1247
01:21:41.269 --> 01:21:43.469
We got a hair of the killer.

1248
01:21:43.602 --> 01:21:46.935
It's only a matter of time
before we know who he is.


1249
01:21:48.569 --> 01:21:51.736
You might wanna look up
that lawyer.


1250
01:21:51.869 --> 01:21:53.335
You might need that.

1251
01:21:58.002 --> 01:21:59.602
Tell you what...

1252
01:22:01.068 --> 01:22:03.102
give him a card.

1253
01:22:03.235 --> 01:22:05.402
Call me, you know where I am.

1254
01:22:05.536 --> 01:22:07.669
Maybe something
will come back to you.

What?

1258
01:22:26.002 --> 01:22:27.369

She gonna be okay?

1262
01:22:41.536 --> 01:22:43.869
She swallowed a whole bottle
of sleeping pills.


1263
01:22:44.002 --> 01:22:47.235
We just pumped her. She is gonna be
okay, she just needs some rest.


1264
01:22:47.369 --> 01:22:50.169
Her husband's in there
with her right now.


1265
01:22:55.335 --> 01:22:59.068
I think we'll see that grief
counselor now, sheriff.


1266
01:23:02.536 --> 01:23:06.402
I want you to know
you're not alone in this.


1267
01:23:06.536 --> 01:23:08.436
You have each other.

1268
01:23:08.569 --> 01:23:13.169
It's important
that you lean on one another

There are five stages
to losing a loved one.

Although you haven't officially
lost your daughter forever,

01:23:26.068 --> 01:23:29.869
you are still experiencing
a sense of loss,


1273
01:23:30.035 --> 01:23:32.602
and going through those stages.

1274
01:23:33.836 --> 01:23:35.702
Denial,

1275
01:23:35.836 --> 01:23:38.469
anger, bargaining.

1276
01:23:38.602 --> 01:23:42.736
I'll do anything
to get my daughter back.


1277
01:23:42.869 --> 01:23:46.269
Placing blame on others,

1278
01:23:46.402 --> 01:23:49.502
<i>and then moving
into depression.</i>


1279
01:23:49.636 --> 01:23:53.035
<i>You might fluctuate
between those stages</i>


1280
01:23:53.169 --> 01:23:57.169
<i>until you arrive
at the final stage.</i>


1281
01:23:58.968 --> 01:24:00.569
<i>Acceptance.</i>

1282
01:24:02.269 --> 01:24:04.235
<i>That last stage,</i>

1283
01:24:04.369 --> 01:24:07.935
<i>well, in your situation,
staying hopeful</i>


1284
01:24:08.068 --> 01:24:11.436
<i>and supportive of each other.</i>

1285
01:24:13.803 --> 01:24:19.602
<i>In many couples,
a wedge can be created.</i>


1286
01:24:19.736 --> 01:24:21.102
<i>They can blame each other.</i>

1287
01:24:21.235 --> 01:24:23.068
<i>It can erode the marriage.</i>

1288
01:24:23.202 --> 01:24:27.402
<i>But by leaning on
each other for support,</i>


1289
01:24:27.536 --> 01:24:30.035
<i>the relationship
can strengthen.</i>


1290
01:24:32.402 --> 01:24:34.669
<i>You must not give up hope,</i>

1291
01:24:34.803 --> 01:24:40.169
<i>but you also must not get stuck
in those other stages.</i>


1292
01:24:40.302 --> 01:24:44.102
<i>It'll lead you
into a downward spiral.</i>


1293
01:24:46.169 --> 01:24:51.002
<i>It's a fine line
between denial and hope.</i>


1294
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:56.935
<i>Acceptance means letting go.</i>

1295

<i>Letting go of that
which is not in your control.</i>

At around 11 p.m. last night,

1350
01:36:14.402 --> 01:36:17.669
the RV park owner Mr. Tom Henry
was killed


1351
01:36:17.803 --> 01:36:20.169
after attacking Mrs. Michaelson
in the back room


1352
01:36:20.302 --> 01:36:24.269
of the RV front office, which
contained child pornography.

01:36:24.402 --> 01:36:26.436
[on TV] <i>At this time,
we believe that Mr. Henry</i>

<i>was behind the disappearance
of Taylor Michaelson.</i>


1355
01:36:29.169 --> 01:36:31.335
We speculate
that he may be involved


1356
01:36:31.469 --> 01:36:33.502
in an underground
child pornography ring


1357

<i>and may be involved
in the murder of Eric Hudson</i>

<i>and the disappearance
of his wife, Miranda Hudson.</i>


1359
01:36:39.068 --> 01:36:42.769
We still do not know the
whereabouts of Taylor Michaelson.

taken the secret to his grave.</i>

asked for privacy during this time</i>


1362
01:36:49.736 --> 01:36:53.202
<i>and are declining
any further press statements.</i>


1363
01:36:53.335 --> 01:36:55.436

any information</i>

[Baker] Want you to know
this investigation isn't over.

01:37:26.569 --> 01:37:29.302
Gotta focus our manpower
on the leader of that tape ring.


1372
01:37:29.436 --> 01:37:31.602
I'm hoping there's
some kind of connection,


1373
01:37:31.736 --> 01:37:33.968
maybe find out where she is.

1374
01:37:35.369 --> 01:37:39.602
Just got off the phone
with the FBI, filled them in.


1375
01:37:39.736 --> 01:37:43.035
They're sending someone up from
their field office up north.
