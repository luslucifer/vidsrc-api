2
00:01:51.122 --> 00:01:53.205
<i>It's a joyous day for me,</i>

3
00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:56.580
<i>because my autobiography,</i>

4
00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.580
<i>is being released.</i>

5
00:01:59.288 --> 00:02:02.747
I'm a very misunderstood man.

6
00:02:03.913 --> 00:02:06.997
If you want to
know the real Sanjay Dutt,

7
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.622
read my autobiography.

8
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.747
It's my story,
but written by my buddy, D. N. Tripathi.


9
00:02:12.997 --> 00:02:15.580
And he wishes that
I read you a chapter.

10
00:02:19.788 --> 00:02:21.288
"Chapter one...

11
00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:22.955
Bapu and Sanju.

12
00:02:24.205 --> 00:02:26.247
Bapu is Mahatma Gandhi.

13
00:02:26.538 --> 00:02:28.663
And, Sanju... Yours truly, Sanjay Dutt.

14
00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:32.788
Our lives have followed
quite a similar graph."


15
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.830
-Hey, Tripathi...
-Yes.


16
00:02:37.913 --> 00:02:40.997
Killer opening! 
Moved me to tears.

17
00:02:41.163 --> 00:02:44.080
Your wish is my command.
I've put my soul into it.


18
00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.705
Mohammed... Sudama... come here.

19
00:02:47.413 --> 00:02:49.913
Tripathi has written a rump-ripping book.

20
00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:52.997
Read us a chapter. 
Nanny, take a seat.

21
00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:57.497
The book is titled "Sage Sanju".

22
00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.080
"Chapter one...

23
00:02:59.247 --> 00:03:01.455
Bapu and Sanju.

24
00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:04.205
Bapu is Mahatma Gandhi.

25
00:03:04.413 --> 00:03:06.580
And, Sanju... Yours truly, Sanjay Dutt.

26
00:03:07.455 --> 00:03:10.330
Our lives have followed
quite a similar graph.


27
00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:13.997
For instance, we've both spent
a lot of time in prison.


28
00:03:14.955 --> 00:03:16.622
He's a national hero.

29
00:03:17.288 --> 00:03:19.372
I'm a Bollywood hero.

30
00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:21.372
He was against violence.

31
00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:25.372
He walked with a stick
but never used it as a weapon


32
00:03:25.622 --> 00:03:30.038
I had an AK-56 rifle
and never used it either.


33
00:03:30.747 --> 00:03:32.455
He dreamed of a free India.

34
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.330
I dream of... my freedom."

35
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.122
Maanyata, it's a slow starter.

36
00:03:39.622 --> 00:03:42.663
Don't worry, the story picks up later.

37
00:03:49.372 --> 00:03:50.497
Hold this...

38
00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:53.080
pick up the bell... ring it.

39
00:03:53.747 --> 00:03:56.205
Go around and worship me.

40
00:03:56.288 --> 00:04:00.455
You've elevated me to Mahatma Gandhi
in the first chapter.


41
00:04:00.538 --> 00:04:02.580
By the end, you'll turn me into god!

42
00:04:02.705 --> 00:04:05.788
Find a temple for sale.

43
00:04:05.955 --> 00:04:07.913
He'll put me on the altar.

44
00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.372
Sorry, Tripathi.

45
00:04:10.705 --> 00:04:12.705
Buddy, tell me...

46
00:04:13.705 --> 00:04:16.580
are shoes allowed inside a temple?

47
00:04:17.872 --> 00:04:19.122
Not at all, Sanju.

48
00:04:19.205 --> 00:04:21.955
Then how dare you wear shoes
in front of God?


49
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.080
Sanju, I'd told you, 
I'm no biographer.

50
00:04:29.163 --> 00:04:30.872
I'm a songwriter...

51
00:04:32.163 --> 00:04:33.747
Sanju... please!

52
00:04:41.038 --> 00:04:43.663
What about me reminds you of Gandhi?

53
00:04:44.247 --> 00:04:45.497
I'll write another draft.

54
00:04:46.622 --> 00:04:49.247
<i>Shithead, you jacked my book!</i>

55
00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:53.122
<i>Our correspondent is outside</i>
<i>the Supreme Court.</i>


56
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.288
<i>In moments, we'll know</i>
<i>whether the actor, Sanjay Dutt,</i>


57
00:04:57.372 --> 00:04:59.580
<i>will go to prison or be free.</i>

58
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.413
<i>In 2006, the Anti-Terrorism Court</i>
<i>had sentenced Sanjay Dutt</i>


59
00:05:04.497 --> 00:05:07.663
<i>to six years imprisonment</i>
<i>in the Mumbai bomb blast case.</i>


60
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.538
<i>He'd appealed to the Supreme Court</i>
<i>against the judgment.</i>


61
00:05:11.747 --> 00:05:16.122
<i>The judgment was expected next week.</i>

62
00:05:16.288 --> 00:05:18.622
<i>But we've just received information</i>

63
00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:21.663
<i>the Supreme Court</i>
<i>will give its verdict today.</i>


64
00:05:22.163 --> 00:05:25.663
<i>Stay tuned, as we report live</i>
<i>from the Supreme Court.</i>


65
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.372
<i>Dinesh, give us an update.</i>

66
00:05:28.455 --> 00:05:32.288
<i>The verdict is out.</i>
<i>Sanjay Dutt will go to prison.</i>


67
00:05:32.372 --> 00:05:35.122
<i>The Court has sentenced him to five years,</i>

68
00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:37.997
<i>for possession of an AK-56 rifle.</i>

69
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.038
<i>When does he go to prison?</i>

70
00:05:41.163 --> 00:05:44.080
<i>The Court has given him</i>
<i>a month to surrender</i>


71
00:05:44.163 --> 00:05:48.413
<i>so he can complete his films.</i>

72
00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:51.497
<i>His father, late Sunil Dutt,</i>
<i>popular actor and politician...</i>


73
00:05:51.913 --> 00:05:56.080
<i>his mother, late Nargis,</i>
<i>iconic actor of the '60s...</i>


74
00:05:56.163 --> 00:05:59.747
<i>the scion of this eminent family,</i>
<i>Sanjay, will go to prison.</i>


75
00:06:00.247 --> 00:06:02.622
<i>Let's hear what people have to say.</i>

76
00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:06.705
<i>Five years is nothing.</i>
<i>He should be hanged!</i>


77
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.205
<i>Traitor... a bloody terrorist!</i>

78
00:06:09.288 --> 00:06:11.497
<i>Celebrities have it easy.</i>

79
00:06:11.872 --> 00:06:14.080
<i>Such terrorists should be shot dead!</i>

80
00:06:27.622 --> 00:06:29.455
Come inside.

81
00:06:41.663 --> 00:06:44.580
<i>When the kids start school,</i>

82
00:06:45.163 --> 00:06:47.580
<i>they are sure to be asked...</i>

83
00:06:48.247 --> 00:06:52.705
<i>"Where's your terrorist-dad? 
In prison?"</i>

84
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.622
<i>It'll be easier for them to say,</i>
<i>"No, he's dead."</i>


85
00:07:12.913 --> 00:07:14.247
<i>Sanju!</i>

86
00:07:14.663 --> 00:07:17.622
Suicide may solve your problem,

87
00:07:17.747 --> 00:07:18.955
not your kids'.

88
00:07:21.372 --> 00:07:23.622
They'll still be called terrorist's kids.

89
00:07:29.122 --> 00:07:32.288
We decided to fight, didn't we?

90
00:07:32.997 --> 00:07:36.205
-That we'll get the truth out there.
-Didn't we try?


91
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.580
What did we get? 
Bapu and Sanju!

92
00:07:39.663 --> 00:07:42.622
That's what you get with knuckleheads.

93
00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:43.830
Write it yourself.

94
00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:46.830
Struggled with a four-line suicide note.

95
00:07:46.913 --> 00:07:48.788
Imagine a 400-page book!

96
00:07:48.913 --> 00:07:50.247
We'll find a good writer.

97
00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.705
Why will they be interested?

98
00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:55.830
It's said,
"Bad choices make good stories."


99
00:07:57.122 --> 00:07:59.830
And you're the king of bad choices.

100
00:08:00.872 --> 00:08:03.163
Some writer out there
will understand this.


101
00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.205
Sanju, be respectful.

102
00:08:19.288 --> 00:08:21.413
<i>She's no Tripathi. 
She's Winnie Diaz.</i>

103
00:08:21.872 --> 00:08:23.372
<i>World's top biographer.</i>

104
00:08:24.247 --> 00:08:25.538
<i>She's down from London.</i>

105
00:08:25.622 --> 00:08:28.580
Control slang like...
rump-ripper, jacked...


106
00:08:29.288 --> 00:08:30.288
Got it.

107
00:08:44.497 --> 00:08:45.372
Winnie

108
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.122
I won't take much of your time.

109
00:08:48.247 --> 00:08:51.538
-I wanted--
-I can't write your biography. I'm sorry.


110
00:08:52.288 --> 00:08:53.122
Why not?

111
00:08:56.538 --> 00:08:59.997
...I asked around and...

112
00:09:00.997 --> 00:09:03.747
And they said I'm a terrorist.

113
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.288
Who are these people? 
Do they know me?

114
00:09:12.497 --> 00:09:15.955
Do they hang out with me?

115
00:09:16.413 --> 00:09:18.413
Then how can they be so sure?

116
00:09:18.997 --> 00:09:23.163
Their opinion is based
merely on TV and print news.


117
00:09:23.538 --> 00:09:26.455
And these TV anchors, newspaper reporters,

118
00:09:26.538 --> 00:09:28.538
who dish out opinions every day,

119
00:09:28.622 --> 00:09:30.663
haven't met me either!

120
00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:34.580
The media has maligned me.

121
00:09:35.205 --> 00:09:38.872
So, I need a good writer
to present my side of the story.


122
00:09:38.955 --> 00:09:44.622
You think millions
will read your biography?


123
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.955
It doesn't work like that.

124
00:09:47.122 --> 00:09:51.705
Thousands of books
rot away in book stores.


125
00:09:52.122 --> 00:09:54.413
Once in a blue
moon a book comes that--

126
00:09:54.497 --> 00:09:56.955
That's a rump-ripper!

127
00:09:57.122 --> 00:10:00.080
My story's that!

128
00:10:00.288 --> 00:10:01.997
What's there in your life story?

129
00:10:05.747 --> 00:10:09.705
Give me just one hour.
Guns, drugs, alcohol...


130
00:10:09.872 --> 00:10:12.497
Pick any chapter, 
I'll tell you the story.

131
00:10:12.747 --> 00:10:15.038
I guarantee, you'll be jacked...

132
00:10:15.913 --> 00:10:20.747
I mean... jack... it'll
be a J K Rowling.

133
00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:24.205
I have a month to surrender.

134
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.705
This time I may not survive.

135
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.747
One hour, please.

136
00:10:37.247 --> 00:10:39.955
5 p.m. tomorrow. Right here.

137
00:10:41.538 --> 00:10:45.288
At 6 p.m., I'll tell you
if I'm jacked or not.


138
00:11:00.122 --> 00:11:03.580
From Amitabh Bachchan to Sachin Tendulkar

139
00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:05.580
you've upset everyone.

140
00:11:06.955 --> 00:11:11.997
So many heroes, but you'll pen
a terrorist's biography!


141
00:11:14.872 --> 00:11:16.163
This is fake news.

142
00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:21.872
He too is a fake.
This is a pressure tactic.


143
00:11:21.955 --> 00:11:23.622
-Who are you?
-Zubin Mistry.


144
00:11:26.205 --> 00:11:27.788
I construct malls.

145
00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:31.163
I suggest you don't write this book.

146
00:11:33.955 --> 00:11:36.705
<i>And you came all
the way to suggest it?</i>

147
00:11:36.913 --> 00:11:41.330
I'm here daily to jog. 
Saw you here, so...

148
00:11:41.497 --> 00:11:44.663
Jog in a suit? 
Is work-wear shorts?

149
00:11:48.872 --> 00:11:50.288
He hit me.

150
00:11:50.372 --> 00:11:52.997
He's on cocaine, 
LSD, heroin...

151
00:11:54.455 --> 00:11:58.747
A womanizer, too. 
Ask him his score.

152
00:11:58.872 --> 00:12:01.913
Any number less than 200, he's lying.

153
00:12:01.997 --> 00:12:05.913
Want to know his truth? Call me.

154
00:12:17.538 --> 00:12:19.122
Sanju.

155
00:12:23.913 --> 00:12:26.788
For once, I feel like thanking the press.

156
00:12:26.913 --> 00:12:29.663
One headline, and you're here.

157
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.580
-Why did you get this printed?
-I didn't, Winnie.


158
00:12:33.997 --> 00:12:37.247
Reporters live outside my gate.
They follow me everywhere.


159
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:38.913
If you were a doctor,

160
00:12:38.997 --> 00:12:42.038
they'd print, "Sanju ill",
an actress... "Sanju's new lady."


161
00:12:42.122 --> 00:12:44.955
They want spicy headlines. 
Not the truth.

162
00:12:45.038 --> 00:12:47.622
-That's why we've come to you.
-Will he tell me the truth?


163
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.830
Nothing but the truth. Fire away.

164
00:12:54.038 --> 00:12:56.913
Excluding your wife,
how many women have you slept with?


165
00:12:58.497 --> 00:12:59.580
Look here.

166
00:13:05.788 --> 00:13:08.747
Should I count the prostitutes or...

167
00:13:08.872 --> 00:13:10.788
No, let's keep them aside.

168
00:13:11.455 --> 00:13:14.663
Never kept a score-card.

169
00:13:15.288 --> 00:13:20.580
But once, I did the math,
I recalled around 308.


170
00:13:20.663 --> 00:13:25.205
I must've missed a few.
On the safe side, let's say... 350.


171
00:13:32.872 --> 00:13:34.247
Do you know him?

172
00:13:36.538 --> 00:13:39.080
Zubin! He was my friend.

173
00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.663
I nicknamed him "God".

174
00:13:41.747 --> 00:13:44.872
Since you picked him,
let's start with chapter "God".


175
00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:55.330
1981... my debut film.
He was always on the sets.


176
00:13:55.413 --> 00:13:59.038
Dad was directing me
and I was nervous as hell.


177
00:13:59.372 --> 00:14:02.580
<i>Is this love?</i>

178
00:14:04.122 --> 00:14:06.622
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

179
00:14:07.538 --> 00:14:08.830
Cut...

180
00:14:08.955 --> 00:14:12.372
Sonny, your lips are off sync.

181
00:14:12.455 --> 00:14:15.622
Match them to the song.

182
00:14:16.663 --> 00:14:22.038
And... a romantic reaction
when the girl sings.


183
00:14:22.122 --> 00:14:24.163
But, Dad, where's the girl?

184
00:14:24.247 --> 00:14:26.580
How do I react to a cold camera?

185
00:14:26.663 --> 00:14:30.247
An actor's job is to imagine.

186
00:14:30.455 --> 00:14:35.830
Imagine a beautiful actress
in front of you.


187
00:14:35.913 --> 00:14:38.455
Ganpat, come here. Observe.

188
00:14:45.705 --> 00:14:49.038
<i>Is this love?</i>

189
00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.955
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

190
00:14:55.163 --> 00:15:00.372
<i>In your absence</i>
<i>Day and night eclipse</i>


191
00:15:00.455 --> 00:15:04.247
<i>And an hour is forever</i>

192
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.788
<i>Is this love?</i>

193
00:15:09.288 --> 00:15:11.663
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

194
00:15:13.247 --> 00:15:14.455
Cut.

195
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.788
Come. Give it a go.

196
00:15:19.205 --> 00:15:21.372
Let's give him a heroine.

197
00:15:22.038 --> 00:15:24.122
Ganpat, come here.

198
00:15:24.872 --> 00:15:28.038
Hold this and stand here.

199
00:15:28.372 --> 00:15:30.330
-Don't move.
-Good idea.


200
00:15:33.955 --> 00:15:37.080
<i>Is this love?</i>

201
00:15:38.747 --> 00:15:40.955
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

202
00:15:43.205 --> 00:15:48.080
<i>In your absence</i>
<i>Day and night eclipse</i>


203
00:15:48.663 --> 00:15:51.747
<i>And an hour is forever</i>

204
00:15:52.663 --> 00:15:55.038
<i>Is this love?</i>

205
00:15:55.122 --> 00:15:56.538
<i>Yes!</i>

206
00:15:57.413 --> 00:15:59.580
<i>Yes, my dove!</i>

207
00:16:00.413 --> 00:16:01.247
Cut it!

208
00:16:01.788 --> 00:16:05.538
Well played, Ramu. Ace!

209
00:16:06.497 --> 00:16:08.372
Sonny...

210
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.413
-You've been smoking?
-No, Dad.


211
00:16:17.788 --> 00:16:18.955
Now you lie, too?

212
00:16:20.413 --> 00:16:25.247
Thousands struggle to be an actor...
with no luck.


213
00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:30.247
You've got it on a silver platter,
respect that.


214
00:16:30.913 --> 00:16:34.538
Drinking, smoking...
will show on your face.


215
00:16:34.622 --> 00:16:36.788
The camera spares no one.

216
00:16:38.788 --> 00:16:42.163
Quit smoking or I'll shelve the film.

217
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:02.705
Smoke with your left hand.
Fathers sniff the right hand.


218
00:17:13.455 --> 00:17:17.413
Bro, I'm the first actor in the world
to romance a bandit.


219
00:17:17.538 --> 00:17:19.622
But, dad praised the cameraman.

220
00:17:19.705 --> 00:17:21.663
"Well played, Ramu! Ace!"

221
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:24.997
However well I do, he never praises me.

222
00:17:25.622 --> 00:17:28.247
He insults me publicly.

223
00:17:28.330 --> 00:17:33.580
-Reason with him.
-That would be suicide.


224
00:17:34.788 --> 00:17:37.247
You're too scared of your dad.

225
00:17:37.497 --> 00:17:39.580
Hey, try this.

226
00:17:41.038 --> 00:17:42.788
It bumps up confidence.

227
00:17:42.872 --> 00:17:47.247
Gladiators would take this before a fight.

228
00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:54.497
Watch.

229
00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:00.038
Put this in your
nose... and snort it all.

230
00:18:00.247 --> 00:18:04.330
I make my Pomeranian snort it
and he thinks he's an Alsatian.


231
00:18:05.122 --> 00:18:06.330
Try it.

232
00:18:08.872 --> 00:18:11.497
Hey! I've been taking it for years.

233
00:18:12.122 --> 00:18:15.038
I'm stronger than you. Try me.

234
00:18:32.372 --> 00:18:33.830
<i>O light of my soul!</i>

235
00:18:35.747 --> 00:18:40.788
<i>If you're heaven's king, 
I'm your queen</i>

236
00:18:42.538 --> 00:18:46.955
<i>If you're the needle, 
I'm the thread</i>

237
00:18:49.038 --> 00:18:53.663
<i>Then why our union</i>

238
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.663
<i>So half-baked, half-baked?</i>

239
00:18:59.997 --> 00:19:03.622
Dad thinks that I
can't lip sync to songs.

240
00:19:23.622 --> 00:19:26.330
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

241
00:19:26.538 --> 00:19:29.247
<i>Marry me, my love</i>

242
00:19:29.622 --> 00:19:34.538
<i>Let sparks fly</i>
<i>So fine, so bright</i>


243
00:19:47.122 --> 00:19:49.830
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

244
00:19:50.038 --> 00:19:52.747
<i>But, I'm a free bird</i>

245
00:19:53.122 --> 00:19:58.080
<i>Keep your fireworks</i>
<i>Too fine, too bright</i>


246
00:19:58.163 --> 00:20:00.872
<i>Take my hand</i>
<i>Marry me quick</i>


247
00:20:00.997 --> 00:20:03.955
<i>Make me yours in a click</i>

248
00:20:04.163 --> 00:20:06.622
<i>Listen up, I'm a wild stallion</i>

249
00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:09.955
<i>Why reduce me to a mere medallion?</i>

250
00:20:11.955 --> 00:20:14.663
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

251
00:20:14.872 --> 00:20:17.580
<i>Marry me, my love</i>

252
00:20:17.913 --> 00:20:21.747
<i>Let sparks fly</i>
<i>So fine, so bright</i>


253
00:20:22.288 --> 00:20:23.372
<i>No way, love!</i>

254
00:20:23.455 --> 00:20:26.247
<i>I'm a fine catch, so are you</i>

255
00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:28.997
<i>But, I'm a free bird</i>

256
00:20:29.497 --> 00:20:34.622
<i>Keep your fireworks</i>
<i>Too fine, too bright</i>


257
00:20:38.705 --> 00:20:42.413
<i>That night, one more Pomeranian</i>
<i>turned into an Alsatian.</i>


258
00:20:42.497 --> 00:20:44.622
<i>God's powder was magic.</i>

259
00:20:44.705 --> 00:20:47.205
<i>My confidence was sky-rocketing.</i>

260
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.330
-Where's the bottle?
-Your dad chucked it.


261
00:20:53.997 --> 00:20:57.788
Damn! For how long will he control me?

262
00:20:58.705 --> 00:21:01.705
My father controlled me for 60 years.

263
00:21:02.288 --> 00:21:04.330
-How did he let go?
-He popped it.


264
00:21:07.413 --> 00:21:09.705
Dudes, don't leave. 
The vodka's coming.

265
00:21:09.788 --> 00:21:11.997
The bar's closed, Sanju.

266
00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:15.830
Dad thinks cutting supply
will make us quit?


267
00:21:16.163 --> 00:21:17.997
I have a back-up daddy

268
00:21:18.122 --> 00:21:20.288
who'll fill up our mugs.

269
00:21:20.372 --> 00:21:23.080
-Back-up dad?
-My girlfriend's pop.


270
00:21:37.205 --> 00:21:38.455
Is daddy home?

271
00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:41.455
Yes, don't sneak in through the balcony.

272
00:21:42.038 --> 00:21:44.372
I'll ring the doorbell. Wake him.

273
00:21:46.497 --> 00:21:47.747
At this hour?

274
00:21:49.122 --> 00:21:50.497
What's so important?

275
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.622
I want something, baby.

276
00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.372
I'll be there in five. 
Open the door.

277
00:22:10.413 --> 00:22:11.788
Wake up your dad.

278
00:22:17.205 --> 00:22:21.747
Dad, mom... wake up. Sanju's here.

279
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:24.038
At 1 a.m.? Is everything okay?

280
00:22:24.122 --> 00:22:26.288
Took him six months to muster courage.

281
00:22:26.372 --> 00:22:29.038
He'd said, once his career kick started,

282
00:22:29.163 --> 00:22:31.663
he'll ask for my hand.

283
00:22:31.747 --> 00:22:34.622
Just the hand, or all of you?

284
00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.288
We'll ask for the 18-year-old scotch.

285
00:22:40.497 --> 00:22:41.913
Will the old fart agree?

286
00:22:42.038 --> 00:22:44.955
If he doesn't agree, we grab and flee!

287
00:22:47.163 --> 00:22:49.247
Hello, child. How are you?

288
00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.455
Before you ask for anything,
I have something for you.


289
00:22:58.497 --> 00:22:59.330
Ten rupees?

290
00:22:59.913 --> 00:23:02.747
My father's gift to me
when I joined the Navy.


291
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.247
He said, "There are two kinds of bills."

292
00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.038
"Real and fake."

293
00:23:09.288 --> 00:23:12.080
When you tug at a real bill...

294
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:15.455
it won't tear.

295
00:23:16.455 --> 00:23:18.788
You're starting your career.

296
00:23:18.872 --> 00:23:22.080
Life will pull you left and right.

297
00:23:22.163 --> 00:23:27.538
But if you stay honest,
nothing can rip you apart.


298
00:23:29.163 --> 00:23:32.288
My father's wisdom is now yours.

299
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:34.372
Homi, let him sit.

300
00:23:34.455 --> 00:23:36.122
Sit.

301
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.622
Now tell us.

302
00:23:38.872 --> 00:23:40.747
What brings you here?

303
00:23:42.997 --> 00:23:47.872
The real reason we're here is...
we have the midnight urge.


304
00:23:50.455 --> 00:23:51.830
Can't control it anymore.

305
00:23:57.372 --> 00:24:00.747
Look, we're weak with idioms.

306
00:24:01.455 --> 00:24:04.372
Tell us clearly, what's a "midnight urge"?

307
00:24:04.455 --> 00:24:06.288
Midnight urge means...

308
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.497
I'm 21 now. It's a biological need.

309
00:24:15.663 --> 00:24:19.372
As soon as midnight strikes...
the urge surges.


310
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:23.788
I need it now... or I'm gonna explode!

311
00:24:24.747 --> 00:24:27.038
But dad doesn't allow it.

312
00:24:27.288 --> 00:24:30.330
He's orthodox. 
So I sin in secret.

313
00:24:31.038 --> 00:24:34.580
Once, I was enjoying an 18-year-old
on the terrace... dad walked in.


314
00:24:34.663 --> 00:24:38.413
I told him frankly, "Dad, I'm an adult.

315
00:24:38.497 --> 00:24:41.705
My friends do it every night.
Their parents never object."


316
00:24:41.955 --> 00:24:46.247
He said, "Alright, have your 18-year-old.
But don't hide.


317
00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:49.080
Do it openly on the dining table,
before the family.


318
00:24:49.163 --> 00:24:51.580
And that too, only once a month."

319
00:24:51.663 --> 00:24:54.413
Daddy, how will once a month
quench this thirst?


320
00:24:54.955 --> 00:24:56.872
Now I frequent the illicit joints.

321
00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:59.538
16, 18, 21...
I grab whatever is available.


322
00:25:00.038 --> 00:25:05.163
I park on a lonely stretch,
and indulge in the backseat.


323
00:25:05.247 --> 00:25:06.913
Only fear is the cops.

324
00:25:07.413 --> 00:25:09.747
They peek when you're about to peak.

325
00:25:10.038 --> 00:25:12.413
Ma'am, try the backseat.

326
00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:17.747
You were a Navy Captain.

327
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:21.080
You must've tasted the best
on every shore.


328
00:25:22.705 --> 00:25:27.413
Be kind, let us
taste some from your home.

329
00:25:29.788 --> 00:25:32.038
-May we get one each?
-What!


330
00:25:32.455 --> 00:25:33.747
Okay, we'll share one.

331
00:25:35.955 --> 00:25:38.705
When daddy gets the urge,
you happily serve.


332
00:25:38.997 --> 00:25:42.747
All we get is a "How dare you!"
Sorry, I've promised my friend.


333
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.913
I'm gonna grab one.

334
00:25:46.038 --> 00:25:48.247
Stop!

335
00:25:51.163 --> 00:25:52.163
Soda or water?

336
00:25:57.913 --> 00:25:59.705
And return my papa's box.

337
00:26:03.622 --> 00:26:05.038
Can I say something?

338
00:26:06.122 --> 00:26:08.705
Your papa was wrong.

339
00:26:08.788 --> 00:26:13.872
Life doesn't just pull you left and right.

340
00:26:14.497 --> 00:26:17.497
It also pulls you up and down.

341
00:26:29.622 --> 00:26:31.872
<i>I drank all night with my friends.</i>

342
00:26:32.413 --> 00:26:33.997
<i>And returned home in the morning.</i>

343
00:26:44.788 --> 00:26:46.622
I'm going for a jog.

344
00:26:54.788 --> 00:26:55.663
Sit.

345
00:27:00.038 --> 00:27:03.247
Sorry, sonny. I yelled at you publicly.

346
00:27:03.872 --> 00:27:08.455
I'm stressed, so couldn't control myself.

347
00:27:10.163 --> 00:27:11.247
A request...

348
00:27:12.538 --> 00:27:15.080
Please focus on your work.

349
00:27:15.163 --> 00:27:18.830
Your mother should feel proud
when she sees your first film.


350
00:27:19.913 --> 00:27:23.622
She may not be
able to see your next.

351
00:27:24.788 --> 00:27:25.622
Why?

352
00:27:30.038 --> 00:27:32.497
She has cancer of the pancreas.

353
00:27:33.205 --> 00:27:36.955
I'm taking her to New York.
Sloan Hospital.


354
00:27:37.038 --> 00:27:39.788
Why didn't anyone tell me?

355
00:27:39.872 --> 00:27:43.330
She hid it from you
so your work won't suffer.


356
00:27:43.747 --> 00:27:46.455
She's been in pain all year.

357
00:27:46.913 --> 00:27:49.413
But acts fit in front of you.

358
00:27:49.497 --> 00:27:51.163
Where are you?

359
00:27:51.872 --> 00:27:54.080
In the dining. 
Want some tea?

360
00:27:54.163 --> 00:27:55.413
Half a cup.

361
00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:56.955
Hide it.

362
00:27:59.163 --> 00:28:00.580
Don't cry in her presence.

363
00:28:00.663 --> 00:28:03.663
She's acting. So must you.

364
00:28:05.122 --> 00:28:07.663
Up so early?

365
00:28:09.038 --> 00:28:11.413
Did you tell Sanju
we're off to New York?

366
00:28:12.538 --> 00:28:15.830
What? Haven't shared the news?

367
00:28:17.163 --> 00:28:20.830
Take a deep breath.
You're gonna be shocked.


368
00:28:22.163 --> 00:28:25.205
I've been offered a Hollywood film.

369
00:28:25.997 --> 00:28:28.413
Now I'll mouth English dialogues.

370
00:28:30.997 --> 00:28:32.663
James Bond.

371
00:28:45.205 --> 00:28:48.247
I wish they had songs like our films.

372
00:28:48.705 --> 00:28:52.663
<i>This heart has lost its mate</i>

373
00:28:53.163 --> 00:28:57.247
<i>No one knows where my liver went</i>

374
00:28:58.122 --> 00:29:01.038
A song here, a dance there,

375
00:29:01.288 --> 00:29:03.080
and the Oscar's mine!

376
00:29:03.788 --> 00:29:05.872
You shouldn't have retired!

377
00:29:05.955 --> 00:29:08.997
Retired? I still act, don't I?

378
00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.080
<i>Dad took mom to New York.</i>

379
00:29:33.163 --> 00:29:35.622
<i>And I started spending more time with God.</i>

380
00:29:37.788 --> 00:29:41.955
I was 18 when I lost my parents
in a car crash.


381
00:29:42.038 --> 00:29:44.538
I was going to kill myself.

382
00:29:44.955 --> 00:29:47.080
A fakir saved me.

383
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:51.247
He said, "The Lord who created pain,
also created a remedy."


384
00:29:51.913 --> 00:29:52.913
Here.

385
00:29:53.122 --> 00:29:56.163
Put it under your tongue.
It'll melt away all pain.


386
00:29:56.247 --> 00:29:59.455
He gets it from the Himalayas.
So it's expensive.


387
00:29:59.622 --> 00:30:01.997
But I'll send him the money.

388
00:30:28.288 --> 00:30:31.997
<i>The first time I did drugs,</i>
<i>was 'cause I was upset with dad.</i>


389
00:30:32.413 --> 00:30:35.247
<i>The second time, 'cause mom was dying.</i>

390
00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:39.830
<i>By the third time, 
I was an addict.</i>

391
00:30:42.205 --> 00:30:44.913
<i>Then I got the news</i>
<i>that mom was in a coma.</i>


392
00:30:45.038 --> 00:30:47.330
<i>Dad summoned me to America.</i>

393
00:30:47.413 --> 00:30:49.455
<i>I traveled with my sisters...</i>

394
00:30:49.622 --> 00:30:51.497
<i>and 20 grams of cocaine.</i>

395
00:30:54.705 --> 00:30:57.080
<i>Being caught at the airport,</i>
<i>would've meant</i>


396
00:30:57.413 --> 00:31:00.913
<i>20 years in prison... even for my sisters.</i>

397
00:31:01.497 --> 00:31:03.330
<i>But back then, 20 years in prison,</i>

398
00:31:03.413 --> 00:31:05.038
<i>versus 20 grams of cocaine...</i>

399
00:31:05.288 --> 00:31:07.330
<i>my choice was crystal clear.</i>

400
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.122
<i>I was so irresponsible</i>

401
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.372
<i>that instead of spending time with mom,</i>

402
00:31:13.455 --> 00:31:16.205
<i>I'd smoke away in the fire exit.</i>

403
00:31:16.455 --> 00:31:19.580
<i>Then one night, walked into my life...</i>

404
00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.955
<i>Mr. Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.</i>

405
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:45.705
-What did you steal?
-Twins...


406
00:31:46.205 --> 00:31:50.080
-O Lord Ganesha!
-This is Jesus' jurisdiction.


407
00:31:50.497 --> 00:31:53.497
Lord Ganesha doesn't operate here.
What did you steal?


408
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:56.997
I'd gone to keep the idol inside.

409
00:32:07.372 --> 00:32:11.330
I'm a fan of your parents.

410
00:32:11.997 --> 00:32:14.830
Thought Lord Ganesha
will heal your mother.


411
00:32:18.997 --> 00:32:20.163
But, what's "Twins"?

412
00:32:21.622 --> 00:32:24.705
Eggs. Back home we call them Twins.

413
00:32:27.413 --> 00:32:29.372
Hope "The Twins" haven't parted ways.

414
00:32:29.747 --> 00:32:30.997
They are out of shape.

415
00:32:33.413 --> 00:32:34.330
Come.

416
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:37.955
-Where?
-To get The Twins back in shape.


417
00:33:15.205 --> 00:33:16.997
Ever seen a topless girl?

418
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:19.080
Of course, I have.

419
00:33:19.413 --> 00:33:22.163
-Where? On TV?
-No, live.


420
00:33:22.372 --> 00:33:25.997
My physics teacher, back home...

421
00:33:26.413 --> 00:33:28.455
his mother slipped in the bathroom.

422
00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.538
I broke the door,
hauled her on my shoulder


423
00:33:31.622 --> 00:33:33.163
and put her in the ambulance.

424
00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.080
Stark naked... topless, bottomless.

425
00:33:36.372 --> 00:33:38.205
How old was she?

426
00:33:38.288 --> 00:33:39.913
Ninety. No, 91.

427
00:33:42.497 --> 00:33:44.205
I did see stuff. 
I'm not naive.

428
00:33:44.955 --> 00:33:47.288
-Ever had alcohol?
-Of course.


429
00:34:11.955 --> 00:34:13.788
There's a saying back home...

430
00:34:13.913 --> 00:34:16.163
"Jam-jam bam-bam."

431
00:34:16.663 --> 00:34:17.747
Translate that.

432
00:34:18.163 --> 00:34:19.747
"Jam-jam" is money.

433
00:34:19.955 --> 00:34:21.747
And "bam-bam"?

434
00:34:23.163 --> 00:34:24.413
Sex.

435
00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:30.080
Your jacket took away jam-jam,
I lost my bam-bam.


436
00:34:30.497 --> 00:34:33.288
You owe me a blonde.

437
00:34:39.247 --> 00:34:40.913
Cover me.

438
00:34:52.413 --> 00:34:53.663
Don't! You'll land in prison.

439
00:34:53.747 --> 00:34:55.163
Relax.

440
00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:50.747
Run!

441
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:08.497
Stop joking. We could've been arrested.

442
00:36:08.663 --> 00:36:10.913
Noble cause, brother.

443
00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:17.538
Your mom's in the hospital
and you're snorting?


444
00:36:17.747 --> 00:36:19.955
Hey, Mr. Righteousness.

445
00:36:20.122 --> 00:36:22.122
We've been friends for just five minutes.

446
00:36:22.705 --> 00:36:25.413
-Control your emotions.
-Friendship?


447
00:36:25.705 --> 00:36:29.247
You aren't a good son!
How'll you be a good friend?


448
00:36:33.913 --> 00:36:36.122
Get lost! I don't need a friend.

449
00:36:43.163 --> 00:36:44.538
Hey, stop!

450
00:36:52.205 --> 00:36:53.747
I just can't quit.

451
00:36:58.705 --> 00:37:00.122
Alright, go!

452
00:37:00.747 --> 00:37:05.080
If my friend was on drugs,
I wouldn't abandon him.


453
00:37:05.163 --> 00:37:06.747
I'd thrash him till he quit.

454
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:17.455
Throw it.

455
00:37:17.538 --> 00:37:20.080
-I'll quit tomorrow.
-Now.


456
00:37:20.247 --> 00:37:21.830
I promise, tomorrow.

457
00:37:22.913 --> 00:37:25.705
-Let go my twins.
-Let go the powder.


458
00:37:25.997 --> 00:37:28.163
-Twins first.
-Powder first.


459
00:37:28.455 --> 00:37:30.872
-I'm desperate.
-It's the time to fight.


460
00:37:31.247 --> 00:37:32.497
Say, "I'm a tiger."

461
00:37:32.705 --> 00:37:34.163
-Now, rorr.
-"Rorr"?


462
00:37:36.163 --> 00:37:36.997
Once more.

463
00:37:41.455 --> 00:37:44.497
I quit! I promise.

464
00:37:46.955 --> 00:37:51.038
Never abandon me, Master.
Such words of wisdom...


465
00:37:51.372 --> 00:37:54.705
Rorr, jam-jam bam-bam, twins.

466
00:37:55.705 --> 00:37:57.163
Guess what?

467
00:37:57.288 --> 00:37:58.830
You didn't twist my twins...

468
00:37:59.913 --> 00:38:01.038
but this.

469
00:38:09.913 --> 00:38:12.163
<i>I was seeking drugs in New York.</i>

470
00:38:12.247 --> 00:38:14.080
<i>Instead, I found a friend.</i>

471
00:38:14.163 --> 00:38:17.413
Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.
They call me Kamli.


472
00:38:17.622 --> 00:38:21.455
As Sex-spear has said, "What's in a name?"

473
00:38:21.997 --> 00:38:24.580
-Who?
-Sex-spear.


474
00:38:25.247 --> 00:38:26.705
William...

475
00:38:27.288 --> 00:38:29.580
-Sir, will you have snakes?
-Snakes?


476
00:38:29.872 --> 00:38:32.163
Snakes. There are lots in the hole.

477
00:38:32.955 --> 00:38:34.205
I'll get it, sir.

478
00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:42.830
<i>In his accent, snacks were "snakes"</i>
<i>and hall was "hole".</i>


479
00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.122
<i>He brought back our smiles.</i>

480
00:38:46.205 --> 00:38:51.163
<i>And miraculously,</i>
<i>his idol got mom out of coma.</i>


481
00:38:51.372 --> 00:38:52.913
Ready, everyone?

482
00:38:53.247 --> 00:38:55.080
Smile.

483
00:39:10.622 --> 00:39:15.372
At your film premiere,
I'll sit between father and son.


484
00:39:16.205 --> 00:39:19.455
As you appear on screen, I'll whistle.

485
00:39:24.288 --> 00:39:28.205
At your wedding, 
I'll dance on the table.

486
00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:30.663
Warn Ruby not to be embarrassed.

487
00:39:33.663 --> 00:39:38.413
<i>Mom didn't know Ruby wasn't talking to me.</i>

488
00:39:42.913 --> 00:39:44.622
<i>Mom didn't have much time left.</i>

489
00:39:45.038 --> 00:39:46.413
<i>I decided</i>

490
00:39:46.497 --> 00:39:50.705
<i>I'd apologize to Ruby's dad</i>
<i>and ask for her hand.</i>


491
00:39:51.413 --> 00:39:53.163
I love Ruby and I want to...

492
00:39:56.205 --> 00:39:57.997
I've come to apologize.

493
00:39:58.288 --> 00:40:01.205
-I misbehaved that day.
-It's alright, child.


494
00:40:01.372 --> 00:40:03.372
-A tipple often does that.
-No, Daddy.


495
00:40:03.955 --> 00:40:07.122
I wasn't just drunk...
I had also done cocaine.


496
00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:13.913
Let me confess. 
The next day I did LSD.

497
00:40:14.288 --> 00:40:16.538
But I've been clean for a month.

498
00:40:19.038 --> 00:40:20.163
Congratulations!

499
00:40:25.038 --> 00:40:26.330
I'll go meet Ruby.

500
00:40:27.163 --> 00:40:29.372
-Ruby.
-Wait.


501
00:40:29.705 --> 00:40:32.372
Meet her on the 22nd
at Hotel Sun and Sand,


502
00:40:32.455 --> 00:40:34.497
with these flowers.

503
00:40:34.955 --> 00:40:36.913
-What's on the 22nd?
-Wait.


504
00:40:43.955 --> 00:40:46.205
That's for your parents.

505
00:40:46.372 --> 00:40:48.455
And that's for you. 
Write your name.

506
00:40:48.538 --> 00:40:51.372
"Ruby weds..." Who's this Rustom?

507
00:40:54.538 --> 00:40:58.455
All this for a 10 rupee bill?
I'll glue it up.


508
00:40:58.538 --> 00:41:02.497
I'm glad you tore it. 
It led us to Rustom!

509
00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.830
He's a doctor in New York.
Not a junkie like you.


510
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.455
Daddy, let me meet Ruby--

511
00:41:14.247 --> 00:41:16.497
Then what should I call you? Old fart?

512
00:41:16.913 --> 00:41:20.497
Meet Ruby over my dead body.

513
00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.455
Fine, I'll wait.

514
00:41:22.538 --> 00:41:23.413
For what?

515
00:41:23.497 --> 00:41:25.163
For you to die, old fart!

516
00:41:27.997 --> 00:41:29.997
Rascal! Scoundrel!

517
00:41:30.205 --> 00:41:32.497
Get out!

518
00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:34.622
I'll break your legs, you swine.

519
00:41:37.038 --> 00:41:41.413
<i>Every addict looks for an excuse</i>
<i>to start again.</i>


520
00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.913
<i>My excuse was Ruby.</i>

521
00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:58.455
<i>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby</i>
<i>Let's rendezvous</i>


522
00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.455
<i>To have you back</i>

523
00:42:10.122 --> 00:42:13.788
<i>Your old man I'll hack</i>

524
00:42:18.163 --> 00:42:21.747
<i>It's a win-win!</i>

525
00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:25.788
<i>He gets heaven, I get you</i>

526
00:42:27.705 --> 00:42:31.163
<i>The world has no heart</i>

527
00:42:31.247 --> 00:42:34.872
<i>So leave it, old fart</i>

528
00:42:35.538 --> 00:42:39.247
<i>Goodbye, old man! 
Just die, old man!</i>

529
00:42:39.497 --> 00:42:44.830
<i>Your daughter, don't worry</i>
<i>Once you're dead, we'll marry</i>


530
00:42:45.288 --> 00:42:49.372
<i>The sincerest prayers are always granted.</i>

531
00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:54.997
<i>The old man died</i>
<i>of a massive heart attack.</i>


532
00:42:55.163 --> 00:43:00.663
<i>The news was tragic. 
But I won't lie,</i>

533
00:43:00.747 --> 00:43:02.913
<i>I was ecstatic.</i>

534
00:43:03.622 --> 00:43:08.705
<i>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby</i>
<i>Get set to rendezvous</i>


535
00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:20.997
<i>Ruby, Ruby, Ruby</i>
<i>You and I, we'll rendezvous</i>


536
00:43:22.955 --> 00:43:26.955
<i>This was my chance to win back Ruby.</i>

537
00:43:31.872 --> 00:43:36.122
<i>I had to show her,</i>
<i>I was more reliable than her fiancé.</i>


538
00:43:39.163 --> 00:43:43.538
<i>A minor problem... 
I was stoned.</i>

539
00:43:43.622 --> 00:43:45.205
Papa!

540
00:43:45.788 --> 00:43:47.788
Don't abandon us, Papa.

541
00:43:47.997 --> 00:43:51.413
-Sanju, that's not papa.
-Wake up.


542
00:43:51.872 --> 00:43:53.080
That's not papa!

543
00:43:57.538 --> 00:44:00.038
Ha! I wondered how he'd shrunk so much.

544
00:44:04.663 --> 00:44:07.413
Is this our papa?

545
00:44:09.538 --> 00:44:11.663
Papa!

546
00:44:12.163 --> 00:44:14.455
Why did you abandon us?

547
00:44:14.622 --> 00:44:16.538
Wake up. Try!

548
00:44:19.955 --> 00:44:21.455
He isn't waking up.

549
00:44:22.163 --> 00:44:24.122
Mummy, don't cry.

550
00:44:24.247 --> 00:44:26.580
Your son-in-law is with you.

551
00:44:30.163 --> 00:44:32.788
Have you read the Holy Gita?

552
00:44:33.455 --> 00:44:36.497
"Everything happens for the best."
Superb!


553
00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.997
"Nothing we create...

554
00:44:40.372 --> 00:44:43.288
so nothing should we mourn."

555
00:44:43.955 --> 00:44:47.163
Did you create this old man?
Gave him birth?


556
00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:53.788
Let her grieve.

557
00:44:53.872 --> 00:44:56.663
When my puppy died, 
I was bawling.

558
00:44:56.747 --> 00:45:00.538
A full-grown husband's exit
deserves howling.


559
00:45:00.622 --> 00:45:02.205
Take your time, Mummy.

560
00:45:02.288 --> 00:45:06.497
But remember, only the body perishes.

561
00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:08.330
The soul is eternal.

562
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.122
Away with this body.

563
00:45:10.413 --> 00:45:12.372
Focus on the soul.

564
00:45:16.122 --> 00:45:18.372
Papa conked and you say, "All okay?"

565
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.538
How shall we dispose the body?

566
00:45:22.663 --> 00:45:24.872
Bury it? Cremate it?

567
00:45:27.247 --> 00:45:29.497
God, that's not our papa.

568
00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.497
Move that body. 
It's freaking confusing.

569
00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.080
Move it.

570
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:35.955
So, Ruby...

571
00:45:40.747 --> 00:45:42.038
What did I do?

572
00:45:46.705 --> 00:45:49.497
No one can tell it's secondhand.

573
00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:51.372
A very fair price.

574
00:45:52.205 --> 00:45:53.663
Five hundred dollars.

575
00:45:55.997 --> 00:45:57.080
What's this?

576
00:45:57.538 --> 00:45:59.163
Robbed a beggar?

577
00:45:59.247 --> 00:46:02.080
Robbed a barber! 
He cuts his own hair.

578
00:46:02.163 --> 00:46:04.247
Puts three dollars in the piggy bank.

579
00:46:04.372 --> 00:46:08.455
-Who's gonna count this?
-Call from India. It's Sanju!


580
00:46:08.538 --> 00:46:10.622
Awesome!

581
00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:18.288
Sanju, perfect timing.
I'm buying my first car.


582
00:46:18.372 --> 00:46:20.247
I need you here, bro.

583
00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.997
Ruby's getting married.

584
00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.330
<i>Please come.</i>

585
00:46:26.497 --> 00:46:29.872
-You snorting again?
-No. I swear.


586
00:46:29.955 --> 00:46:32.455
Please... come down.

587
00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.705
Sanju... Hello?

588
00:46:39.038 --> 00:46:41.247
Sir, no need to count.

589
00:46:41.413 --> 00:46:43.788
-The car will have to wait.
-Why?


590
00:46:43.872 --> 00:46:47.163
Need to buy a ticket to India.

591
00:46:49.913 --> 00:46:51.038
Sorry, sir.

592
00:46:51.288 --> 00:46:53.205
Didn't want the car? 
Why make me count?

593
00:47:01.872 --> 00:47:03.038
Hello, Ruby.

594
00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:06.372
I'm Kamlesh Kanhaiyalal Kapasi.
Sanju's friend.


595
00:47:07.205 --> 00:47:09.122
Sir, can you go inside?

596
00:47:09.372 --> 00:47:10.497
Take a loo break.

597
00:47:12.372 --> 00:47:15.288
-Need to discuss a private matter.
-Come.


598
00:47:19.413 --> 00:47:22.830
Whatever the matter,
say it in front of me.


599
00:47:23.247 --> 00:47:25.330
It'll upset you.

600
00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.622
Take a stroll outside. 
Lovely weather.

601
00:47:32.705 --> 00:47:34.080
Really?

602
00:47:37.622 --> 00:47:39.830
Then name Ruby's favorite animal.

603
00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:47.122
You live in New York?

604
00:47:47.705 --> 00:47:51.247
Ask any jeweler there...

605
00:47:51.455 --> 00:47:53.663
They'll all say... "Penguin".

606
00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.538
-Know why?
-Why?


607
00:47:56.663 --> 00:48:00.247
For a month, Sanju hopped
from jeweler to jeweler


608
00:48:00.413 --> 00:48:04.372
for a wedding necklace
with a penguin pendant.


609
00:48:04.913 --> 00:48:06.455
And finally got it!

610
00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.455
But when he returned to India,

611
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.163
he discovered that you were engaged.

612
00:48:11.872 --> 00:48:15.163
He was shattered, so took to drugs again.

613
00:48:15.247 --> 00:48:17.497
But yesterday, he braved up.

614
00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.788
Flushed all the drugs down the drain.

615
00:48:20.247 --> 00:48:22.622
Swore never to touch them again.

616
00:48:22.705 --> 00:48:25.455
He prayed, "Lord, bring Ruby back."

617
00:48:26.288 --> 00:48:28.163
Sanju's back.

618
00:48:28.663 --> 00:48:29.872
Can you come back?

619
00:48:31.830 --> 00:48:34.288
The wedding date, venue... it's all set.

620
00:48:34.372 --> 00:48:36.622
Nothing changes, except the groom.

621
00:48:36.705 --> 00:48:38.622
The wedding cards have been printed.

622
00:48:38.705 --> 00:48:41.830
We'll put a "Sanju" sticker
over your name.


623
00:48:41.913 --> 00:48:43.455
Don't sweat the small stuff.

624
00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:52.830
Ruby, in America
there'll be no house help.


625
00:48:53.038 --> 00:48:55.288
You'll be cleaning, mopping, washing...

626
00:48:55.455 --> 00:48:57.997
Imagine washing his sweaty underpants!

627
00:48:59.705 --> 00:49:01.247
I told you, you'd be upset.

628
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:05.163
Sanju will be at the Marriage Registrar's,
tomorrow at 4 p.m.


629
00:49:19.955 --> 00:49:21.747
Mister, what's her favorite food?

630
00:49:24.122 --> 00:49:26.497
Waffles. Sanju knows.

631
00:49:28.330 --> 00:49:29.705
Her favorite film?

632
00:49:30.913 --> 00:49:32.330
<i>Mary Poppins.</i>

633
00:49:32.455 --> 00:49:35.372
Sanju knows. You have no clue.

634
00:49:35.913 --> 00:49:37.288
Ruby, 4 p.m. tomorrow.

635
00:49:37.705 --> 00:49:39.830
The Marriage Registrar's office.

636
00:49:55.788 --> 00:49:57.872
Where did you get money for this?

637
00:49:58.205 --> 00:50:00.330
Your wallet, checks... 
They're with me.

638
00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.372
The wedding necklace...

639
00:50:05.497 --> 00:50:06.580
What about it?

640
00:50:06.705 --> 00:50:09.163
I sold it to God.

641
00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:23.955
-Where's he?
-He isn't home.


642
00:50:24.038 --> 00:50:25.913
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

643
00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:43.247
I wait at the Registrar's office
and you get stoned here?


644
00:50:43.788 --> 00:50:47.497
No sweat. We'll marry tomorrow.

645
00:50:51.038 --> 00:50:54.872
You'd flushed the drugs!
Fished them out again?


646
00:51:01.372 --> 00:51:04.163
Where's the wedding necklace?

647
00:51:05.788 --> 00:51:07.372
Where is it?

648
00:51:07.872 --> 00:51:10.163
Where's the bloody necklace?

649
00:51:19.372 --> 00:51:20.788
The wedding necklace.

650
00:51:46.538 --> 00:51:48.330
Please wait, Ruby.

651
00:51:50.538 --> 00:51:52.455
I'm sorry...

652
00:51:53.247 --> 00:51:54.247
Yuck.

653
00:51:54.497 --> 00:51:58.163
He's not in his senses.
Won't remember a thing tomorrow!


654
00:51:58.247 --> 00:52:01.788
I swear, he did buy the wedding necklace.

655
00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.372
He's too far gone

656
00:52:06.663 --> 00:52:09.288
and to expect you'll
hang on is not right.

657
00:52:10.788 --> 00:52:14.163
You move on, I'm with him.

658
00:52:24.705 --> 00:52:25.955
Kamlesh.

659
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:27.288
Yes, Ruby.

660
00:52:27.372 --> 00:52:29.538
Don't ever tell him what he did.

661
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.788
He'll be devastated.

662
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:33.413
Tell him...

663
00:52:34.538 --> 00:52:36.997
that rotten Ruby never showed up.

664
00:52:56.830 --> 00:52:58.497
You've been drinking?

665
00:52:58.622 --> 00:53:02.455
What I wanna say needs courage.

666
00:53:03.288 --> 00:53:05.872
So I downed a couple.

667
00:53:06.747 --> 00:53:07.997
Tell me.

668
00:53:09.538 --> 00:53:12.705
Your son will die before your wife!

669
00:53:13.205 --> 00:53:16.372
-He can't handle his life.
-Why?


670
00:53:17.122 --> 00:53:20.122
He sees you nursing your ailing wife.

671
00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:25.455
Any responsibility at home,
film industry, society...


672
00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:28.413
he sees you never shirk it.

673
00:53:31.205 --> 00:53:33.080
And your son...

674
00:53:34.497 --> 00:53:36.955
He's an ordinary guy.

675
00:53:37.247 --> 00:53:40.372
No goals, no purpose in life.

676
00:53:40.455 --> 00:53:45.122
He says,
"There are three things to life, bro."


677
00:53:46.413 --> 00:53:49.413
"C, B, S."

678
00:53:50.288 --> 00:53:53.538
"Chew, brew and scr..."

679
00:53:59.288 --> 00:54:02.913
The problem is, you
want him to be you!

680
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:05.997
He's buried...

681
00:54:06.372 --> 00:54:09.788
buried under the weight of your legacy!

682
00:54:10.288 --> 00:54:14.205
He knows, however hard he toils,
he can never be as great.


683
00:54:14.288 --> 00:54:17.163
So, he doesn't even try.

684
00:54:19.247 --> 00:54:22.205
Feels a hero with nobodies like me.

685
00:54:22.288 --> 00:54:25.830
"Yo, Kamli...", "Hey, Kamli..."

686
00:54:29.705 --> 00:54:32.747
What should I do, Kamlesh?

687
00:54:32.830 --> 00:54:34.372
Sir, you...

688
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.913
Just be his friend.

689
00:54:40.997 --> 00:54:42.913
Sit with him.

690
00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:44.747
Drink with him.

691
00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:47.497
Use a few cuss words, and say...

692
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:52.372
"Sonny, it's okay to be ordinary."

693
00:54:52.872 --> 00:54:55.038
"You don't have to be Sunil Dutt."

694
00:54:55.122 --> 00:54:57.913
"It's okay to be Sanjay Dutt.”

695
00:54:58.413 --> 00:55:01.997
Sir, please save him.

696
00:55:03.830 --> 00:55:04.913
If he dies,

697
00:55:04.997 --> 00:55:08.788
whom will I tell, "Let go my twins"?

698
00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:14.497
Please, sir, save him.

699
00:55:17.413 --> 00:55:19.080
Save him.

700
00:55:39.163 --> 00:55:41.372
I showed the distributors your film.

701
00:55:41.497 --> 00:55:46.538
They went crazy...
"What a freaking actor!"


702
00:55:52.122 --> 00:55:53.872
Has mom seen the posters?

703
00:55:54.163 --> 00:55:55.997
She's in hospital.

704
00:55:56.538 --> 00:55:57.455
What happened?

705
00:55:58.872 --> 00:56:01.163
She slipped into a coma again.

706
00:56:01.247 --> 00:56:04.997
-I just met her yesterday!
-No, day before.


707
00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:08.913
You've woken up after two days. It's okay.

708
00:56:13.247 --> 00:56:15.038
I've spoken to the doctors.

709
00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:18.247
They recommend a rehab center in America.

710
00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:19.455
Ready?

711
00:56:20.205 --> 00:56:21.205
No!

712
00:56:21.455 --> 00:56:22.955
Please don't send me there, Dad.

713
00:56:23.122 --> 00:56:24.830
Just a few days, sonny.

714
00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:26.497
No.

715
00:56:30.788 --> 00:56:34.205
Come out. We won't send you anywhere.

716
00:56:34.288 --> 00:56:37.122
I had one cigarette, you packed me off
to boarding school.


717
00:56:37.205 --> 00:56:40.038
I was just six.
Couldn't even tie my shoelaces.


718
00:56:40.122 --> 00:56:41.413
I missed mom.

719
00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:44.247
Please come out.

720
00:56:45.497 --> 00:56:47.288
I won't go anywhere.

721
00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:50.080
I'll stay with mom in the hospital!

722
00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:58.080
<i>Dad agreed... on one condition.</i>

723
00:56:58.205 --> 00:57:01.497
<i>That I wouldn't do drugs in the hospital.</i>

724
00:57:01.788 --> 00:57:03.205
<i>And I promised.</i>

725
00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:06.247
<i>I started spending</i>
<i>every night at the hospital.</i>


726
00:57:06.747 --> 00:57:09.372
<i>I'd stare at mom for hours.</i>

727
00:57:09.705 --> 00:57:12.163
<i>I'd hold her hand and talk to her.</i>

728
00:57:12.538 --> 00:57:14.580
The premiere's next week.

729
00:57:14.747 --> 00:57:16.080
Won't you come?

730
00:57:16.538 --> 00:57:17.538
Get up, Mom.

731
00:57:17.872 --> 00:57:19.705
You gotta see me act.

732
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:21.997
You'll be proud, Mom.

733
00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.038
Mom.

734
00:57:26.538 --> 00:57:27.747
<i>Then one day...</i>

735
00:57:27.955 --> 00:57:29.330
<i>I couldn't resist.</i>

736
00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.455
<i>Sanju...</i>

737
00:58:55.622 --> 00:58:57.747
<i>Mom never saw my film.</i>

738
00:58:58.497 --> 00:59:02.163
<i>She died three days before the premiere.</i>

739
00:59:02.747 --> 00:59:04.080
<i>She'd left a note...</i>

740
00:59:04.163 --> 00:59:07.080
<i>"Even if I'm gone,
the show must go on."</i>

741
00:59:14.538 --> 00:59:20.122
<i>They call me Rocky</i>
<i>Yes, my name is Rocky!</i>


742
00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:28.122
<i>Friend and foe</i>
<i>To both I say hello</i>


743
00:59:28.997 --> 00:59:35.580
<i>Friend and foe</i>
<i>To both I say hello</i>


744
00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:42.747
<i>They call me Rocky</i>
<i>Yes, my name is Rocky!</i>


745
00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:47.330
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.


746
00:59:48.872 --> 00:59:51.788
Excuse me, Mr. Dutt.
Is anyone sitting here?


747
00:59:52.747 --> 00:59:55.580
Yes... my wife.

748
01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:20.705
<i>Sanju, you'll be a film star!</i>

749
01:00:22.538 --> 01:00:25.080
<i>Dad worries a lot about you.</i>

750
01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:28.080
<i>I've been offered a Hollywood film.</i>

751
01:00:28.247 --> 01:00:30.997
<i>At your wedding, 
I'll dance on the table.</i>

752
01:00:36.163 --> 01:00:37.413
Sanju.

753
01:00:46.038 --> 01:00:47.205
What happened?

754
01:00:48.455 --> 01:00:51.038
Mom opened her eyes before she died.

755
01:00:51.997 --> 01:00:55.288
She touched my head to bless me.

756
01:00:59.372 --> 01:01:02.497
Not sure if it happened
or I was hallucinating...


757
01:01:03.163 --> 01:01:04.955
I'm a mess, Dad.

758
01:01:05.247 --> 01:01:08.413
I can't tell what's real
and what's imaginary.


759
01:01:11.788 --> 01:01:13.038
Are you real, Dad?

760
01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:16.830
Buddy, listen.

761
01:01:16.997 --> 01:01:18.830
Is that Mr. Sunil Dutt?

762
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.997
-Is dad there?
-Yes.


763
01:01:23.997 --> 01:01:25.288
Please save me, Dad.

764
01:01:25.455 --> 01:01:26.622
I want to quit drugs.

765
01:01:26.788 --> 01:01:28.247
I want to live.

766
01:01:32.455 --> 01:01:35.580
You'll be fine, sonny.

767
01:01:42.163 --> 01:01:44.038
<i>Dad got me to America for treatment.</i>

768
01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:51.955
<i>I was given a list.</i>

769
01:01:58.622 --> 01:02:01.038
<i>He was shocked that I was still alive.</i>

770
01:02:10.122 --> 01:02:12.122
<i>My treatment started.</i>

771
01:02:15.913 --> 01:02:18.497
<i>As the drugs stopped, my body rebelled.</i>

772
01:02:18.830 --> 01:02:20.747
<i>A storm unleashed within.</i>

773
01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.872
<i>Often I shivered as
if inside an ice slab.</i>

774
01:02:23.997 --> 01:02:26.122
<i>Biting cold I couldn't bear.</i>

775
01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:30.163
<i>Often my body was ablaze.</i>

776
01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:31.830
<i>I was burning.</i>

777
01:02:33.372 --> 01:02:34.997
<i>Bombs exploded in my head.</i>

778
01:02:35.122 --> 01:02:37.830
<i>My pulse would spike up to 150.</i>

779
01:02:38.038 --> 01:02:39.997
<i>My hands would tremor.</i>

780
01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.747
<i>Depression, anxiety... 
I couldn't bear it.</i>

781
01:03:02.163 --> 01:03:04.705
<i>I couldn't take it. 
I ran away.</i>

782
01:03:05.205 --> 01:03:06.913
<i>I was desperate for drugs.</i>

783
01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.038
<i>The only person who'd lend me money</i>

784
01:03:31.163 --> 01:03:34.455
<i>was 1500 miles away, in New York.</i>

785
01:03:38.455 --> 01:03:42.330
<i>Like a madman,</i>
<i>I took off for New York... on foot.</i>


786
01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:17.205
<i>I realized the power of attire.</i>

787
01:04:17.413 --> 01:04:19.663
<i>When the clothes were clean, 
I got rides.</i>

788
01:04:20.247 --> 01:04:23.497
<i>When dirty, 
I got alms.</i>

789
01:04:29.747 --> 01:04:31.538
<i>Both served well.</i>

790
01:04:33.788 --> 01:04:36.580
<i>A few days of begging</i>
<i>earned me a bus ticket.</i>


791
01:04:36.705 --> 01:04:39.872
<i>In 12 days, 
I was in New York.</i>

792
01:04:58.830 --> 01:05:00.788
I'll have one drink and go back.

793
01:05:02.288 --> 01:05:03.872
Never had a drink with you.

794
01:05:04.705 --> 01:05:08.455
Just one and I'll go away.

795
01:05:46.455 --> 01:05:48.663
When your mom was in hospital,

796
01:05:48.872 --> 01:05:52.330
she'd send these recordings.

797
01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:54.288
Ever listened to them?

798
01:06:00.663 --> 01:06:03.247
<i>Silly piglet, how are you?</i>

799
01:06:04.538 --> 01:06:07.913
<i>Remember, when angry,</i>
<i>I'd call you "piglet"?</i>


800
01:06:08.997 --> 01:06:12.788
<i>And you'd say, "Why are you</i>
<i>calling your husband names?"</i>


801
01:06:12.955 --> 01:06:16.413
<i>"If I'm a piglet, my father's the swine!"</i>

802
01:06:18.247 --> 01:06:20.663
<i>Hello, Sanju. This is Mr. Swine.</i>

803
01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:23.830
<i>-Working hard?</i>
<i>-Don't worry about me.</i>


804
01:06:24.163 --> 01:06:26.622
<i>I won't die before I see your film.</i>

805
01:06:26.872 --> 01:06:29.580
<i>I'm by your side. 
Steadfast!</i>

806
01:06:29.663 --> 01:06:31.455
<i>Like a Master said,</i>

807
01:06:31.747 --> 01:06:35.497
<i>Wherever you go</i>

808
01:06:36.038 --> 01:06:39.705
<i>My shadow will follow</i>

809
01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:42.913
<i>Tell him your theory of the Masters.</i>

810
01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.622
<i>Before the movies, 
I was a radio jockey.</i>

811
01:06:46.997 --> 01:06:51.288
<i>I encountered thousands of songs</i>
<i>with beautiful, deep verses.</i>


812
01:06:51.538 --> 01:06:53.955
<i>I accepted those songwriters</i>
<i>as my Masters.</i>


813
01:06:54.038 --> 01:06:58.413
<i>When in trouble, I say,</i>
<i>"Guide me, O Master."</i>


814
01:06:58.497 --> 01:07:01.080
<i>And a song comes to rescue.</i>

815
01:07:01.163 --> 01:07:04.705
<i>So which Master can help Sanju?</i>

816
01:07:05.247 --> 01:07:06.830
Majrooh Sultanpuri.

817
01:07:06.913 --> 01:07:09.788
<i>Presenting from Sloan Hospital...</i>

818
01:07:10.497 --> 01:07:11.913
<i>Water, please.</i>

819
01:07:13.163 --> 01:07:14.872
Dad, it's the tape.

820
01:07:18.288 --> 01:07:21.330
<i>Here's some water. 
Please rest.</i>

821
01:07:21.413 --> 01:07:23.413
<i>What about the song?</i>

822
01:07:23.538 --> 01:07:27.205
<i>Tomorrow, I promise! Rest now.</i>

823
01:07:30.663 --> 01:07:31.997
Which song was it, Dad?

824
01:07:35.163 --> 01:07:38.413
<i>Don't you ever stop</i>

825
01:07:39.163 --> 01:07:41.413
<i>With your head hung in despair</i>

826
01:07:42.788 --> 01:07:45.663
<i>After this woeful walk over thorns</i>

827
01:07:45.747 --> 01:07:48.872
<i>You will enjoy</i>
<i>The embrace of blossoms</i>


828
01:07:49.997 --> 01:07:52.830
<i>Wanderer,</i>
<i>O wanderer</i>


829
01:07:55.288 --> 01:07:57.122
<i>O Wanderer</i>

830
01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:10.163
<i>Break every shackle</i>

831
01:08:14.038 --> 01:08:19.247
<i>Smith each into</i>

832
01:08:20.955 --> 01:08:24.538
<i>A sword</i>

833
01:08:26.122 --> 01:08:31.788
<i>Fight every battle</i>

834
01:08:32.997 --> 01:08:37.997
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

835
01:08:49.955 --> 01:08:52.163
<i>You may be shattered</i>

836
01:08:52.788 --> 01:08:55.538
<i>Show them you ain't battered</i>

837
01:08:55.663 --> 01:08:59.705
<i>Hope still simmers in your soul!</i>

838
01:09:01.247 --> 01:09:03.497
<i>When your spirit you wield</i>

839
01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.788
<i>The heavens will yield</i>

840
01:09:06.955 --> 01:09:10.997
<i>Lead you unfettered to your goal</i>

841
01:09:12.413 --> 01:09:14.705
<i>If by miseries you're hunted</i>

842
01:09:15.205 --> 01:09:17.580
<i>If your weapons are blunted</i>

843
01:09:18.038 --> 01:09:22.705
<i>Stop failure's advances</i>
<i>With those broken lances</i>


844
01:09:22.788 --> 01:09:25.080
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

845
01:09:25.788 --> 01:09:28.247
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

846
01:09:28.538 --> 01:09:31.413
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

847
01:09:32.038 --> 01:09:34.080
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

848
01:09:34.288 --> 01:09:36.705
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

849
01:09:37.122 --> 01:09:39.538
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

850
01:09:39.955 --> 01:09:42.955
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

851
01:09:43.038 --> 01:09:45.538
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

852
01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:05.455
<i>Take by the scruff of the neck</i>

853
01:10:05.538 --> 01:10:08.663
<i>The dark clouds of misery</i>

854
01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:13.288
<i>Rattle them till they reveal</i>
<i>The abode of Victory</i>


855
01:10:13.663 --> 01:10:16.872
<i>With the stars you'll be crowned</i>

856
01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.038
<i>The sky, your playground</i>

857
01:10:20.163 --> 01:10:25.080
<i>Break away from the herd</i>

858
01:10:25.413 --> 01:10:30.663
<i>Fortune will be yours</i>
<i>That so far frowned</i>


859
01:10:31.413 --> 01:10:35.497
<i>Stop failure's advances</i>
<i>With those broken lances</i>


860
01:10:39.122 --> 01:10:41.497
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

861
01:10:41.997 --> 01:10:44.413
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

862
01:10:44.788 --> 01:10:48.122
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

863
01:10:48.205 --> 01:10:50.205
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

864
01:10:50.288 --> 01:10:52.913
<i>Climb every mountain</i>

865
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:55.788
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

866
01:10:56.247 --> 01:10:58.997
<i>Strive, do not bow down</i>

867
01:10:59.288 --> 01:11:01.622
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

868
01:11:02.163 --> 01:11:07.205
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

869
01:11:07.288 --> 01:11:13.413
<i>Attain what you seek!</i>

870
01:11:19.413 --> 01:11:25.747
<i>Fight every battle</i>

871
01:11:27.122 --> 01:11:32.247
<i>Conquer every peak</i>

872
01:11:35.913 --> 01:11:38.455
He's off drugs for 18 months.

873
01:11:38.997 --> 01:11:42.997
Wear sunglasses,
our boy is glowing like a floodlight.


874
01:11:44.872 --> 01:11:50.205
As your Sex-spear says,
"All's well that ends well."


875
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:54.830
Take the bags. 
The taximeter's on.

876
01:11:55.413 --> 01:11:56.913
Hurry up.

877
01:11:57.872 --> 01:11:59.080
It's not "the end" yet.

878
01:11:59.163 --> 01:12:02.288
<i>The doctor warned, he could relapse.</i>

879
01:12:02.372 --> 01:12:05.538
If he starts again, he'll die.

880
01:12:06.247 --> 01:12:08.913
Please keep him away from bad company.

881
01:12:09.497 --> 01:12:10.872
Thank you, son.

882
01:12:28.747 --> 01:12:32.413
Dad, you carry on. 
I'll join you.

883
01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.330
For how long can we stop him?

884
01:12:40.705 --> 01:12:44.788
Now he must fight his own battles.
Let's go.


885
01:12:45.247 --> 01:12:47.163
I thought you wouldn't meet me.

886
01:12:47.788 --> 01:12:49.455
How could I not?

887
01:12:49.663 --> 01:12:53.080
I thought of you every day
the past 18 months.


888
01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:58.622
I have a special welcome-back gift.

889
01:12:58.788 --> 01:13:02.122
Haven't seen such fine stuff in 18 years.

890
01:13:02.663 --> 01:13:05.205
Just to celebrate your return.

891
01:13:05.372 --> 01:13:09.830
Normally, I don't share
such exclusive stuff with anyone.


892
01:13:11.538 --> 01:13:12.913
To your health.

893
01:13:18.122 --> 01:13:20.330
Bro, that's my dose. It's potent.

894
01:13:20.622 --> 01:13:22.080
Too strong for you.

895
01:13:22.413 --> 01:13:25.038
Doesn't such potent stuff
ruin your health?


896
01:13:26.497 --> 01:13:28.788
Your parents must've
gifted you strong genes.


897
01:13:28.913 --> 01:13:30.413
How are they?

898
01:13:30.497 --> 01:13:33.747
They're fine... by the grace of God.

899
01:13:34.038 --> 01:13:36.497
Amazing!
They're reborn after the car crash?


900
01:13:44.955 --> 01:13:47.913
Glucose powder suits me fine.

901
01:13:48.872 --> 01:13:49.955
Now try that!

902
01:13:57.788 --> 01:13:59.455
I cracked it!

903
01:13:59.538 --> 01:14:02.830
You took glucose and fed me drugs.

904
01:14:04.122 --> 01:14:06.830
You aren't an addict, you're a peddler!

905
01:14:07.205 --> 01:14:09.538
Posed as a friend for my money.

906
01:14:13.372 --> 01:14:16.080
Bro, I'll return your money.

907
01:14:16.163 --> 01:14:17.913
Great idea!

908
01:14:17.997 --> 01:14:21.247
Return those five years
which I was too numb to feel.


909
01:14:23.288 --> 01:14:27.080
My father hasn't slept in five years.
Return that lost sleep.


910
01:14:28.205 --> 01:14:31.413
I lost Ruby. Can you get her back?

911
01:14:31.788 --> 01:14:34.747
My sisters stopped smiling.
Return that smile.


912
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:36.997
Can you? You peddler!

913
01:15:05.788 --> 01:15:08.330
My real gods.

914
01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:10.205
And one more.

915
01:15:13.705 --> 01:15:15.497
Lord Ganesha, MD.

916
01:15:16.413 --> 01:15:18.330
He's lived with me in prison, too.

917
01:15:24.330 --> 01:15:25.497
You're crying?

918
01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:28.163
Was the story so bad?

919
01:15:30.247 --> 01:15:31.955
Will you write it?

920
01:15:44.538 --> 01:15:46.080
We'll continue then.

921
01:15:49.538 --> 01:15:52.538
Winnie, do you have a boyfriend?

922
01:15:53.288 --> 01:15:56.205
-Yes. Why?
-Tell him, he's very lucky.


923
01:15:56.788 --> 01:15:58.830
'Cause I'm intelligent and good looking?

924
01:16:00.163 --> 01:16:02.538
-'Cause I'm going to prison.
-Stop it.


925
01:16:03.705 --> 01:16:05.747
When he's happy he blabbers.

926
01:16:26.955 --> 01:16:29.663
So, you met the terrorist.

927
01:16:29.747 --> 01:16:33.455
Also figured why you're
desperate to stop me.


928
01:16:34.038 --> 01:16:37.788
Once a drug-peddler, now a big builder.

929
01:16:41.122 --> 01:16:43.288
Even his lies seem true.

930
01:16:43.663 --> 01:16:49.538
Ask him why his best friend, Kamlesh,
hasn't spoken to him in 20 years.


931
01:16:50.538 --> 01:16:52.163
Ask him.

932
01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:25.163
I'm writing a book
on your friend, Sanjay Dutt.


933
01:17:26.955 --> 01:17:28.372
He's not my friend.

934
01:17:31.497 --> 01:17:35.538
But he says, "Kamli is my best friend."

935
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:38.788
In a past life.

936
01:17:40.413 --> 01:17:46.372
Then in this life, why are you
glued to the TV watching his news?


937
01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.997
-You called from India?
-Right. And you hung up.


938
01:18:46.205 --> 01:18:47.247
So, I'm here.

939
01:18:48.538 --> 01:18:52.705
Look, I promise, I won't even
mention you in the book.


940
01:18:56.705 --> 01:18:58.913
-Shall we sit somewhere?
-Sure.


941
01:18:59.622 --> 01:19:01.997
I know a great place.

942
01:19:04.997 --> 01:19:05.913
Where?

943
01:19:08.872 --> 01:19:10.288
Follow Aunt Annie.

944
01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:18.788
Remember this place?

945
01:19:42.497 --> 01:19:46.455
He loves you. Why
did you cut off ties?

946
01:19:48.538 --> 01:19:50.622
Do you know what RDX is?

947
01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:55.122
It was used in the Mumbai bomb blasts.

948
01:19:55.205 --> 01:19:56.955
And where was it stored?

949
01:19:58.538 --> 01:20:00.955
In a truck parked at Sanjay Dutt's house.

950
01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.997
He knew Mumbai would be bombed,
but kept mum.


951
01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:08.372
-Who told you?
-The man who loved him the most.


952
01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:09.788
Who?

953
01:20:10.705 --> 01:20:13.205
Sunil Dutt... his father.

954
01:20:35.705 --> 01:20:37.455
Tell me your side of the story.

955
01:20:37.538 --> 01:20:39.622
If he's a terrorist, 
I'll scrap the book.

956
01:20:39.788 --> 01:20:42.663
I flew 12000 km just to meet you.

957
01:20:42.747 --> 01:20:45.705
And I wasted 12 years
of my life with him.

958
01:20:46.038 --> 01:20:47.288
No more time for him.

959
01:20:47.372 --> 01:20:49.455
He's the one with no time.
He's off to prison.


960
01:20:49.538 --> 01:20:51.330
Know what he's taking along?

961
01:21:04.497 --> 01:21:06.872
This story has four characters.

962
01:21:06.997 --> 01:21:08.830
Sanjay Dutt, Sunil Dutt,

963
01:21:08.913 --> 01:21:11.663
I, and the Babri mosque.

964
01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:17.080
Babri mosque was demolished
on 6th December, 1992.


965
01:21:17.913 --> 01:21:19.372
Riots burned the country.

966
01:21:21.122 --> 01:21:23.622
<i>Mr. Dutt was then a Member of Parliament.</i>

967
01:21:23.788 --> 01:21:25.205
<i>He'd stopped making films.</i>

968
01:21:25.288 --> 01:21:27.455
<i>All his time was spent serving people.</i>

969
01:21:28.163 --> 01:21:30.372
<i>When riots erupted in his constituency</i>

970
01:21:30.455 --> 01:21:34.163
<i>and Muslim homes were burnt,</i>
<i>he plunged into relief work.</i>


971
01:21:35.372 --> 01:21:38.205
<i>And his son, unconcerned,</i>
<i>lived in his own world.</i>


972
01:21:45.497 --> 01:21:50.663
<i>He was no longer the drug-addict.</i>

973
01:21:50.747 --> 01:21:55.080
<i>He reigned as an A-list film star</i>
<i>those 12 years.</i>


974
01:21:55.455 --> 01:21:58.538
<i>As for me... my IT business</i>
<i>was prospering.</i>


975
01:21:58.788 --> 01:22:01.622
<i>I made tons of money.</i>
<i>But had one grouse...</i>


976
01:22:02.122 --> 01:22:03.913
<i>I was still a virgin.</i>

977
01:22:03.997 --> 01:22:07.288
<i>Then I met a girl, Pinky.</i>

978
01:22:07.372 --> 01:22:13.038
<i>I flew every weekend to Mumbai,</i>
<i>hoping to get lucky.</i>


979
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:18.955
<i>The result... 
I was jetlagged 24/7.</i>

980
01:22:19.413 --> 01:22:21.872
Still on the runway? 
Not taken off?

981
01:22:21.955 --> 01:22:24.038
Sir, we've landed.

982
01:22:24.122 --> 01:22:24.955
Landed?

983
01:22:25.038 --> 01:22:27.872
<i>This time, Sanju had</i>
<i>invited Pinky for dinner.</i>


984
01:22:28.580 --> 01:22:32.580
<i>The mission was to make sure I score.</i>

985
01:22:38.288 --> 01:22:39.830
Pinky loves pink.

986
01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:42.413
She asked for a pink t-shirt.

987
01:22:42.497 --> 01:22:44.913
So you bought the store?

988
01:22:45.038 --> 01:22:45.872
Superb!

989
01:22:48.913 --> 01:22:51.413
Control... You're drinking too much.

990
01:22:51.788 --> 01:22:54.038
Need courage to open my account.

991
01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:56.622
Account! Which bank?

992
01:22:56.747 --> 01:23:00.747
My aunt's cousin is a banker.
You'll be done in a jiffy.


993
01:23:01.038 --> 01:23:03.788
-You need an account, too?
-No, I have many accounts.


994
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:14.580
What's all this?

995
01:23:15.247 --> 01:23:16.747
All for you.

996
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:21.997
This pink t-shirt, sweater,

997
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:24.997
lin-jer-ree...

998
01:23:27.872 --> 01:23:32.413
This pink nightie, just for you! Try it.

999
01:23:32.622 --> 01:23:37.622
No, I'll stick to the t-shirt.

1000
01:23:43.413 --> 01:23:44.538
One moment.

1001
01:23:46.413 --> 01:23:48.747
Do you know why
nighties are called nighties?


1002
01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:50.497
Why?

1003
01:23:51.455 --> 01:23:53.705
'Cause they are worn at night.

1004
01:23:55.247 --> 01:24:00.205
Scriptures say,
hour and attire must match.


1005
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:18.163
I've got her in the nightie.

1006
01:24:18.538 --> 01:24:21.038
-Your job is to get her out of it.
-Done!


1007
01:24:22.663 --> 01:24:26.497
Don't overdrink,
or there'll be no bam-bam.


1008
01:24:27.955 --> 01:24:31.205
I'm out of here. Freshen up.

1009
01:24:31.372 --> 01:24:32.497
I'll change, too.

1010
01:24:57.372 --> 01:25:00.913
<i>On a journey to the moon</i>

1011
01:25:02.413 --> 01:25:06.163
<i>Let's dance, let's swoon</i>

1012
01:25:07.247 --> 01:25:10.830
<i>It's one night's delight</i>

1013
01:25:12.247 --> 01:25:14.997
<i>Then our paths will divide</i>

1014
01:25:16.747 --> 01:25:20.455
<i>On a journey to the moon</i>

1015
01:25:21.747 --> 01:25:25.330
<i>Let's dance, let's swoon</i>

1016
01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:29.913
<i>Just one night's delight</i>

1017
01:25:31.372 --> 01:25:34.580
<i>Come, set me alight</i>

1018
01:25:35.163 --> 01:25:36.455
Kamli...

1019
01:25:41.455 --> 01:25:44.455
Kamli, wake up.

1020
01:25:44.622 --> 01:25:45.747
Get up.

1021
01:25:47.038 --> 01:25:49.038
Time for bam-bam.

1022
01:25:49.247 --> 01:25:50.622
Wake up. You're a tiger.

1023
01:25:50.913 --> 01:25:53.038
Roar!

1024
01:25:53.413 --> 01:25:54.372
Come on.

1025
01:26:09.997 --> 01:26:14.538
<i>You are no saint</i>

1026
01:26:14.872 --> 01:26:18.913
<i>Nor am I</i>

1027
01:26:19.747 --> 01:26:24.288
<i>It's one night's delight</i>

1028
01:26:24.580 --> 01:26:28.705
<i>Let's not be uptight</i>

1029
01:26:32.705 --> 01:26:36.997
<i>On a journey to the moon</i>

1030
01:26:37.788 --> 01:26:42.080
<i>Let's dance, let's swoon</i>

1031
01:26:42.663 --> 01:26:46.872
<i>Just one night's delight</i>

1032
01:26:47.413 --> 01:26:51.372
<i>Come, set me alight</i>

1033
01:27:06.538 --> 01:27:08.788
Baby, you ready?

1034
01:27:08.872 --> 01:27:10.413
Have breakfast, Kamli.

1035
01:27:10.747 --> 01:27:13.372
-You're meeting some girls today.
-I have a girlfriend.


1036
01:27:13.455 --> 01:27:16.372
Forget her. She's a floozy.

1037
01:27:16.455 --> 01:27:19.622
-Shush... she'll hear you.
-She's gone.


1038
01:27:20.163 --> 01:27:22.747
You were very irresponsible last night!

1039
01:27:23.122 --> 01:27:25.705
You passed out and I had to bam-bam...

1040
01:27:26.038 --> 01:27:28.538
and then wrap up your pink store.

1041
01:27:29.955 --> 01:27:32.497
Chill, I'll set it up
for the next attempt.


1042
01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:35.372
Tell me you're lying.

1043
01:27:36.413 --> 01:27:40.122
I was checking her loyalty towards you.

1044
01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:44.913
I held her hand,
she rubbed it with her thumb.


1045
01:27:45.247 --> 01:27:47.955
That's all she does.

1046
01:27:48.288 --> 01:27:50.538
Never goes further.

1047
01:27:51.538 --> 01:27:53.205
With me, she went further, bro.

1048
01:27:54.205 --> 01:27:56.580
I said, "Nightie."

1049
01:27:59.455 --> 01:28:00.747
She took it off?

1050
01:28:07.247 --> 01:28:09.247
It was clear,
she can't be my sister-in-law.


1051
01:28:10.163 --> 01:28:11.955
No one cheats on my best friend!

1052
01:28:12.872 --> 01:28:16.205
It was guilt-free bam-bam.
What's her name?


1053
01:28:16.788 --> 01:28:18.705
You slept with her
and don't know her name?


1054
01:28:18.788 --> 01:28:20.955
Name after the game? Bad manners!

1055
01:28:21.038 --> 01:28:23.163
You swine!

1056
01:28:24.413 --> 01:28:27.747
I've unveiled her true colors.

1057
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:30.538
You should be grateful.

1058
01:28:31.788 --> 01:28:32.955
<i>Hey, Sanju.</i>

1059
01:28:33.455 --> 01:28:35.955
<i>Your pop's buddying up to the Muslims.</i>

1060
01:28:36.288 --> 01:28:38.413
-Drill sense into him.
-Who the hell...?


1061
01:28:38.497 --> 01:28:41.038
<i>You half
-Muslim!</i>

1062
01:28:41.122 --> 01:28:44.372
<i>Your sister is sizzling hot.</i>
<i>Shall I get her raped?</i>


1063
01:28:44.663 --> 01:28:45.538
Hey!

1064
01:28:47.747 --> 01:28:50.622
<i>It's a stone. 
Could've been a grenade.</i>

1065
01:28:50.955 --> 01:28:54.580
<i>Your pop's loading trucks</i>
<i>with relief material, right?</i>


1066
01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:59.247
<i>-I'll bump him off.</i>
<i>-Hello!</i>


1067
01:29:14.455 --> 01:29:17.163
-Let's get out of here.
-We've got a threat call.


1068
01:29:17.372 --> 01:29:20.205
You wake up late. 
I've already got five.

1069
01:29:20.413 --> 01:29:22.288
Barking dogs seldom bite.

1070
01:29:22.413 --> 01:29:24.622
Out here you can be shot.

1071
01:29:24.705 --> 01:29:25.788
We'll shield him.

1072
01:29:26.455 --> 01:29:28.163
We'll take the bullet.

1073
01:29:28.247 --> 01:29:32.163
We'll defend Mr. Dutt
till our last breath.


1074
01:29:32.247 --> 01:29:34.247
With that toy? 
Does it even work?

1075
01:29:34.330 --> 01:29:36.163
Yes, it does.

1076
01:29:42.038 --> 01:29:44.705
When did you last
fire it? World War II?

1077
01:29:45.122 --> 01:29:46.580
Stop it, Sanju.

1078
01:29:46.663 --> 01:29:48.455
Hurry, load the truck.

1079
01:29:48.788 --> 01:29:51.038
Reason with dad. 
He never listens to me.

1080
01:29:51.163 --> 01:29:54.288
Look at him, and then at yourself.

1081
01:29:54.372 --> 01:29:55.913
He helps strangers.

1082
01:29:55.997 --> 01:29:59.247
While you bam-bam your best friend's girl.

1083
01:30:21.538 --> 01:30:24.580
<i>Hey, Kamli, remember the strip club?</i>

1084
01:30:25.330 --> 01:30:27.997
I lost out on
a chick for your jacket.

1085
01:30:28.497 --> 01:30:31.955
<i>Remember, you owed me a blonde.</i>

1086
01:30:32.372 --> 01:30:34.913
Let's say Pinky is the blonde,
and we're square!


1087
01:30:36.122 --> 01:30:38.163
<i>I'm in New York on the 22nd.</i>

1088
01:30:38.247 --> 01:30:40.163
I'll wait outside the same club.

1089
01:30:41.997 --> 01:30:43.080
Wear that red jacket

1090
01:30:43.788 --> 01:30:46.038
<i>and I'll know you've forgiven me.</i>

1091
01:30:49.205 --> 01:30:50.747
Kamli, please forgive me.

1092
01:30:53.705 --> 01:30:54.580
Kamli...

1093
01:30:58.455 --> 01:31:04.122
<i>They say, "Life is what happens</i>
<i>when you're making other plans."</i>


1094
01:31:04.455 --> 01:31:09.122
<i>While he was planning his trip,</i>
<i>life had other plans.</i>


1095
01:31:30.455 --> 01:31:32.705
<i>Twelve bombs exploded that day.</i>

1096
01:31:32.788 --> 01:31:35.747
<i>250 people died. 800 were injured.</i>

1097
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:38.330
<i>Police investigations revealed a name...</i>

1098
01:31:38.747 --> 01:31:40.080
<i>Tiger Memon.</i>

1099
01:31:40.663 --> 01:31:43.247
<i>In the riots following</i>
<i>the Babri mosque demolition,</i>


1100
01:31:43.330 --> 01:31:46.830
<i>Tiger Memon's office was burnt down.</i>
<i>He struck back.</i>


1101
01:31:47.788 --> 01:31:51.080
<i>As the truth unfolded, many were arrested.</i>

1102
01:31:52.663 --> 01:31:55.080
Kamlesh, read the news?

1103
01:31:57.413 --> 01:31:58.330
No. Why?

1104
01:31:58.413 --> 01:32:00.788
Your friend was involved
in the Bombay bomb blasts.


1105
01:32:01.705 --> 01:32:02.955
He's been arrested.

1106
01:32:03.038 --> 01:32:05.413
He had an AK-56 rifle.

1107
01:32:09.413 --> 01:32:12.372
Did you possess an AK-56 rifle?

1108
01:32:12.788 --> 01:32:13.747
No, sir.

1109
01:32:21.788 --> 01:32:25.747
Did you possess an AK-56?

1110
01:32:26.163 --> 01:32:27.413
I'll tell you, sir.

1111
01:32:27.955 --> 01:32:29.705
I'll tell you everything...

1112
01:32:30.455 --> 01:32:32.080
but please don't tell dad.

1113
01:32:43.122 --> 01:32:45.038
-Babu?
-Kamli.


1114
01:32:46.538 --> 01:32:49.955
I knew you'd come.

1115
01:32:50.372 --> 01:32:51.622
I'm glad.

1116
01:32:52.247 --> 01:32:56.205
Sir, I'm sure the AK-56 charges are bogus.

1117
01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:03.247
-Here's Sanju's confession.
-Read it.


1118
01:33:12.413 --> 01:33:15.538
Dad would send relief material
to riot victims.


1119
01:33:15.997 --> 01:33:17.497
Majority of them were Muslims.

1120
01:33:19.330 --> 01:33:21.538
Some people didn't approve.

1121
01:33:22.372 --> 01:33:23.955
They thought dad was pro
-Muslim.

1122
01:33:25.622 --> 01:33:27.205
That's when the threats started...

1123
01:33:28.538 --> 01:33:31.455
to murder us and rape my sisters.

1124
01:33:32.288 --> 01:33:33.580
I was terrified.

1125
01:33:34.288 --> 01:33:37.788
Then there were two attacks on dad.

1126
01:33:38.247 --> 01:33:40.830
I requested special protection,
but was denied.


1127
01:33:41.747 --> 01:33:44.580
I feared a mob attack any time.

1128
01:33:46.038 --> 01:33:49.205
Hanif and Samir, producers of my film...

1129
01:33:50.122 --> 01:33:54.205
suggested I keep... an assault rifle,
for protection.


1130
01:34:04.413 --> 01:34:08.288
<i>In January, Samir, Hanif,</i>
<i>and Salem came home.</i>


1131
01:34:36.913 --> 01:34:40.080
<i>They gave me three rifles</i>
<i>and some bullets,</i>


1132
01:34:40.163 --> 01:34:42.288
<i>which I kept in my car.</i>

1133
01:34:45.622 --> 01:34:47.205
<i>Soon, I panicked.</i>

1134
01:34:48.538 --> 01:34:52.705
I'll keep only one rifle
till the riots end.


1135
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:54.955
Please take away the rest.

1136
01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:57.163
<i>They came back two days later.</i>

1137
01:34:57.663 --> 01:35:02.372
<i>I returned two rifles.</i>
<i>Kept one rifle and 250 bullets.</i>


1138
01:35:04.413 --> 01:35:07.788
<i>On 2nd April, I went to Mauritius</i>
<i>for a film shoot.</i>


1139
01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:11.497
<i>I got news of Hanif and Samir's arrest.</i>

1140
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:15.705
<i>I feared they'd rat me out.</i>

1141
01:35:16.622 --> 01:35:18.705
<i>I called my friend, 
Yusuf Nulwala.</i>

1142
01:35:19.622 --> 01:35:22.580
Yusuf, go to my house.

1143
01:35:23.663 --> 01:35:25.330
<i>Go to my room.</i>

1144
01:35:25.913 --> 01:35:28.080
<i>You'll find a black bag.</i>

1145
01:35:30.872 --> 01:35:33.205
<i>There's some stuff in it.</i>

1146
01:35:33.622 --> 01:35:35.163
<i>Destroy it.</i>

1147
01:35:50.122 --> 01:35:51.622
<i>Then one day, dad called.</i>

1148
01:35:52.538 --> 01:35:56.205
The papers say,
you possess an AK-56 rifle.


1149
01:35:56.747 --> 01:35:58.413
AK-56? No, Dad!

1150
01:35:58.580 --> 01:36:01.163
I've got you a meeting
with the Police Commissioner.


1151
01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:02.413
Come to Bombay.

1152
01:36:03.788 --> 01:36:06.955
<i>Dad informed the cops about my arrival,</i>

1153
01:36:07.205 --> 01:36:11.205
<i>and assured them he'll get me</i>
<i>to the police station.</i>


1154
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:12.622
<i>But...</i>

1155
01:36:16.747 --> 01:36:17.913
Mr. Sanjay Dutt.

1156
01:36:25.872 --> 01:36:27.913
Deliver the luggage to his father.

1157
01:36:29.038 --> 01:36:30.163
Come with me.

1158
01:36:30.330 --> 01:36:32.163
-What's the problem, officer?
-Come.


1159
01:36:33.413 --> 01:36:34.747
Sir, what happened?

1160
01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:37.830
Get in.

1161
01:36:48.705 --> 01:36:51.788
Last time, we won the fight against drugs.

1162
01:36:52.913 --> 01:36:57.830
But this time...
the battle will be tougher.


1163
01:36:59.372 --> 01:37:02.955
-I'll need you, son.
-I'm not going anywhere, sir.


1164
01:37:03.663 --> 01:37:06.163
The "snakes" are in the "hole."

1165
01:37:06.663 --> 01:37:07.872
Grab a bite.

1166
01:37:09.455 --> 01:37:11.122
Sleep in Sanju's room.

1167
01:37:12.455 --> 01:37:13.955
I'll be here for a while.

1168
01:37:19.705 --> 01:37:20.830
Switch off the fan.

1169
01:37:21.455 --> 01:37:23.080
Sir, it's hot.

1170
01:37:25.288 --> 01:37:27.663
He sleeps without a fan, too.

1171
01:37:52.913 --> 01:37:54.788
<i>For security reasons,</i>

1172
01:37:54.872 --> 01:38:00.247
<i>Sanju was kept in isolation</i>
<i>in a windowless cell.</i>


1173
01:38:00.872 --> 01:38:04.288
<i>His only companions were ants.</i>

1174
01:38:04.538 --> 01:38:07.330
It's been seven days, soldiers.

1175
01:38:08.038 --> 01:38:09.580
When will I get bail?

1176
01:38:13.163 --> 01:38:14.788
Tell me.

1177
01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.163
Please...

1178
01:38:37.705 --> 01:38:39.705
Sir, the pot is overflowing.

1179
01:38:40.538 --> 01:38:41.788
Sir.

1180
01:38:47.413 --> 01:38:48.372
Please help!

1181
01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:54.247
Help!

1182
01:39:02.288 --> 01:39:06.955
<i>He suffered inside prison</i>
<i>and his dad, outside.</i>


1183
01:39:10.205 --> 01:39:11.747
Look, the terrorist's pop.

1184
01:39:32.955 --> 01:39:33.872
Come.

1185
01:39:37.788 --> 01:39:39.205
Give him a shave.

1186
01:39:41.413 --> 01:39:43.747
You're done.

1187
01:39:44.330 --> 01:39:46.247
Come, wash your face.

1188
01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:48.497
You speak English!

1189
01:39:49.038 --> 01:39:52.080
I've done my Masters. 
Even had a bank job.

1190
01:39:53.288 --> 01:39:54.747
How'd you land here?

1191
01:39:55.372 --> 01:39:57.080
My wife cheated on me.

1192
01:39:57.955 --> 01:39:58.997
I killed her!

1193
01:39:59.872 --> 01:40:01.705
Chopped her into pieces,

1194
01:40:01.788 --> 01:40:05.997
stuffed her in a bag
and left it on a long distance train.


1195
01:40:06.955 --> 01:40:07.997
A porter saw me,

1196
01:40:08.455 --> 01:40:09.913
and here I am.

1197
01:40:10.455 --> 01:40:13.372
-I'll skip the shave.
-Why?


1198
01:40:13.663 --> 01:40:16.580
Need a beard for my next film.

1199
01:40:16.872 --> 01:40:19.830
I'm playing Santa Claus.
He had a big beard.


1200
01:40:20.122 --> 01:40:23.663
I've to let it grow.

1201
01:40:25.372 --> 01:40:27.913
Hello! This is Sunil Dutt.

1202
01:40:28.705 --> 01:40:29.663
A moment.

1203
01:40:30.122 --> 01:40:31.372
Mr. Dutt.

1204
01:40:33.497 --> 01:40:35.205
Sir, the minister's bathing.

1205
01:40:35.663 --> 01:40:40.038
Morning, noon and evening?

1206
01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:41.830
He's always in the bath!

1207
01:40:41.913 --> 01:40:44.580
Health reasons, sir.

1208
01:40:44.997 --> 01:40:48.830
He has a fungal infection on his thigh.

1209
01:40:50.038 --> 01:40:51.872
I'll pass on your message.

1210
01:40:53.997 --> 01:40:55.955
<i>Everyone avoided Mr. Dutt.</i>

1211
01:40:56.122 --> 01:41:00.580
<i>Terror charges being stigmatic,</i>
<i>no one wanted any involvement.</i>


1212
01:41:01.872 --> 01:41:07.497
Partner, we've been roomies for 180 days.

1213
01:41:08.872 --> 01:41:11.330
That's longer than any girl
I've been with.


1214
01:41:13.413 --> 01:41:17.163
Supreme Court will hear
my bail petition today.


1215
01:41:18.288 --> 01:41:20.872
Which means I'm a free bird.

1216
01:41:24.872 --> 01:41:26.705
I'll miss you.

1217
01:41:27.997 --> 01:41:31.080
-Your bail's been rejected.
-What?


1218
01:41:31.247 --> 01:41:34.413
Bail is always tough in the Terror Act.

1219
01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:36.455
Sir...

1220
01:42:15.872 --> 01:42:18.247
Dad, what's up with my bail?

1221
01:42:18.372 --> 01:42:22.288
Don't worry, sonny.
We're going to the Supreme Court.


1222
01:42:22.622 --> 01:42:23.455
You get better.

1223
01:42:24.038 --> 01:42:27.247
Why are you lying?

1224
01:42:28.663 --> 01:42:32.830
I know my bail's rejected.
I've been in for six months.


1225
01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:35.747
You know the Prime Minister...
the President... speak to them.


1226
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:39.705
What have I done?
Killed anyone? Fire a bullet?


1227
01:42:40.372 --> 01:42:42.247
Just kept a gun, for your protection!

1228
01:42:42.705 --> 01:42:44.122
My protection?

1229
01:42:46.163 --> 01:42:50.622
I'd rather you shot me with that gun!

1230
01:42:57.872 --> 01:42:59.080
He'll never appreciate me.

1231
01:43:00.788 --> 01:43:05.747
Praises my sisters all the time...
"Ace! Well played!"


1232
01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.247
I want to die.

1233
01:43:09.747 --> 01:43:10.580
Please help me.

1234
01:43:17.163 --> 01:43:18.663
There's cyanide in the tea.

1235
01:43:21.872 --> 01:43:22.788
Drink up.

1236
01:43:29.247 --> 01:43:30.538
Vodka in the tea?

1237
01:43:30.622 --> 01:43:32.955
Now chill! Don't blabber about dying.

1238
01:43:33.038 --> 01:43:34.455
Think of your dad!

1239
01:43:34.872 --> 01:43:36.997
He strives from dawn to dusk
for your bail.


1240
01:43:37.163 --> 01:43:40.955
Begs lawyers, politicians, cops...

1241
01:43:41.413 --> 01:43:44.538
Sleeps on the floor
'cause you have no bed.


1242
01:43:44.872 --> 01:43:47.122
Doesn't use the fan
'cause you don't have one.


1243
01:43:47.205 --> 01:43:50.955
People call him, "Terrorist's pop."

1244
01:43:51.955 --> 01:43:54.997
You've twisted his twins,
now spare him your suicide!


1245
01:43:55.497 --> 01:43:57.872
Fight! You'll definitely get bail.

1246
01:44:06.872 --> 01:44:08.163
Once out of prison...

1247
01:44:08.997 --> 01:44:10.955
get a sexy girlfriend.

1248
01:44:11.705 --> 01:44:15.247
I'll get you drunk and bam-bam her!

1249
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:17.330
Then, we're even.

1250
01:44:19.247 --> 01:44:22.663
"I want to die." Enough! 
You're a tiger.

1251
01:44:23.288 --> 01:44:26.038
"Rorr"... come on.

1252
01:44:26.580 --> 01:44:27.997
"Rorr!"

1253
01:44:37.205 --> 01:44:39.247
<i>He spent 452 days in prison.</i>

1254
01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:42.455
<i>The Supreme Court finally</i>
<i>granted him bail.</i>


1255
01:44:43.205 --> 01:44:45.580
<i>But his name was now</i>
<i>synonymous with the word...</i>


1256
01:44:48.705 --> 01:44:51.247
<i>The public and the press hated him.</i>

1257
01:44:51.913 --> 01:44:55.622
<i>He was being tried under the Terror Act...</i>

1258
01:44:55.955 --> 01:44:58.247
<i>he feared his bail would be canceled.</i>

1259
01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.288
<i>His only hope was political intervention.</i>

1260
01:45:02.788 --> 01:45:06.788
<i>An influential minister in the capital</i>
<i>agreed to meet him.</i>


1261
01:45:07.205 --> 01:45:08.080
Hello, sir.

1262
01:45:09.205 --> 01:45:12.580
Come... sit.

1263
01:45:13.330 --> 01:45:14.872
How's daddy?

1264
01:45:15.538 --> 01:45:16.580
He has a fever.

1265
01:45:16.663 --> 01:45:18.455
Very good...

1266
01:45:19.872 --> 01:45:21.705
What brings you here?

1267
01:45:22.663 --> 01:45:23.997
Sir, I'll be honest.

1268
01:45:25.205 --> 01:45:26.247
I did possess a gun.

1269
01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:29.497
I should be tried under the Arms Act.

1270
01:45:30.205 --> 01:45:32.413
But they've slapped me
with the Terror Act.


1271
01:45:33.788 --> 01:45:36.705
If I was involved in the bomb blasts,

1272
01:45:36.913 --> 01:45:38.372
would I return to India?

1273
01:45:38.872 --> 01:45:41.080
I could've run away from Mauritius.

1274
01:45:41.622 --> 01:45:43.455
Taken asylum in another country.

1275
01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:55.372
-He's dozed off!
-Speak louder.


1276
01:45:58.080 --> 01:46:01.955
Sir, I got a gun because
I feared a mob attack.


1277
01:46:06.872 --> 01:46:10.705
<i>If the minister really slept</i>
<i>or play acted to avoid us</i>


1278
01:46:10.788 --> 01:46:12.705
<i>is still a mystery.</i>

1279
01:46:17.663 --> 01:46:18.747
How's daddy?

1280
01:46:20.455 --> 01:46:23.455
-He has a fever.
-Very good...


1281
01:46:25.205 --> 01:46:26.705
What brings you here?

1282
01:46:28.288 --> 01:46:31.372
Our legs brought us here...
we'll go back swimming.


1283
01:46:31.455 --> 01:46:33.913
Very good...

1284
01:46:34.122 --> 01:46:36.372
Let me know if I can help.

1285
01:46:36.955 --> 01:46:39.080
<i>It was evident, we were on our own.</i>

1286
01:46:39.872 --> 01:46:42.997
<i>I decided that until Sanju was cleared</i>
<i>of terror charges,</i>


1287
01:46:43.330 --> 01:46:46.788
<i>I'd be by his side. 
But the next day...</i>

1288
01:46:54.872 --> 01:46:55.913
Babu, where's Sanju?

1289
01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:57.830
In the preview theatre.

1290
01:47:08.622 --> 01:47:10.747
No one goes in. Mr. 
Dutt's orders.

1291
01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:16.913
Tell the Court, you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.


1292
01:47:19.705 --> 01:47:20.872
Kamlesh,

1293
01:47:21.205 --> 01:47:22.455
please wait outside.

1294
01:47:38.122 --> 01:47:39.122
Where are you going?

1295
01:47:39.955 --> 01:47:42.413
FBI raided my office.

1296
01:47:43.163 --> 01:47:44.163
Why?

1297
01:47:49.622 --> 01:47:51.830
What's that got to do with the FBI?

1298
01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:55.830
My company works with
the American government.


1299
01:47:56.163 --> 01:47:58.413
Now they'll investigate our association.

1300
01:47:59.038 --> 01:48:00.997
Terror charges freak them out.

1301
01:48:04.288 --> 01:48:05.288
Sorry, buddy.

1302
01:48:06.330 --> 01:48:08.080
I've put you through all this...

1303
01:48:09.705 --> 01:48:14.080
-Call me when you get there.
-No... my phone will be tapped.


1304
01:48:15.913 --> 01:48:18.288
We must disconnect for a few years.

1305
01:48:21.038 --> 01:48:24.038
Don't worry. I understand. Go...

1306
01:48:25.663 --> 01:48:27.872
Hey, Kamli. You're a tiger.

1307
01:48:36.330 --> 01:48:37.538
Let's go.

1308
01:48:47.955 --> 01:48:50.330
First time ever I lied to Sanju.

1309
01:48:50.413 --> 01:48:52.205
I can be friends with an addict.

1310
01:48:52.997 --> 01:48:58.747
Even with a guy who slept with my girl.
But with a terrorist? I'm no fool!


1311
01:49:01.372 --> 01:49:04.247
Every time I drink, I miss him...

1312
01:49:04.872 --> 01:49:06.288
yearn to call him.

1313
01:49:07.705 --> 01:49:09.580
Then I remind myself...

1314
01:49:10.497 --> 01:49:13.788
there was a truck full of RDX
at his house.


1315
01:49:13.872 --> 01:49:15.663
He's a bloody terrorist!

1316
01:49:17.788 --> 01:49:19.038
Are we done?

1317
01:49:22.913 --> 01:49:24.038
<i>Mail from Winnie.</i>

1318
01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:25.705
Where's she?

1319
01:49:26.788 --> 01:49:27.622
America.

1320
01:49:28.997 --> 01:49:30.163
She won't write the book.

1321
01:49:33.663 --> 01:49:36.288
<i>Sanjay Dutt was given 30 days</i>
<i>to surrender.</i>


1322
01:49:36.455 --> 01:49:37.788
<i>That time is over.</i>

1323
01:49:37.955 --> 01:49:42.205
<i>He's on his way to prison.</i>

1324
01:49:42.788 --> 01:49:43.747
<i>Clothes off.</i>

1325
01:49:44.747 --> 01:49:45.913
Raise your hands.

1326
01:49:48.747 --> 01:49:49.955
Turn.

1327
01:49:54.122 --> 01:49:55.122
Bend.

1328
01:49:57.705 --> 01:49:58.872
Cough.

1329
01:49:59.455 --> 01:50:00.622
Harder.

1330
01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:43.038
You dropped Sanju's story
for a book on museums?


1331
01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:49.205
-Museums don't lie.
-Nor did Sanju.


1332
01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:53.455
But a news report
became your gospel truth.


1333
01:50:56.038 --> 01:50:57.038
What's this?

1334
01:50:57.705 --> 01:51:00.997
Prison has a community radio
for prisoners' reform.


1335
01:51:01.413 --> 01:51:03.830
Sanju hosts a show.

1336
01:51:04.330 --> 01:51:06.747
He wants you to hear this episode.

1337
01:51:06.955 --> 01:51:08.497
Took great pains to smuggle it out.

1338
01:51:12.997 --> 01:51:14.205
My number.

1339
01:51:14.538 --> 01:51:16.538
You'll need it after you're done.

1340
01:51:30.913 --> 01:51:33.205
<i>Howdy, Yerwada!</i>

1341
01:51:33.288 --> 01:51:37.830
This is your buddy, Sanju!

1342
01:51:41.872 --> 01:51:46.372
Today's topic is "newspapers."

1343
01:51:47.038 --> 01:51:50.080
There were no newspapers 400 years ago.

1344
01:51:50.413 --> 01:51:52.205
News traveled word of mouth.

1345
01:51:52.288 --> 01:51:54.455
<i>Then, someone printed the first newspaper.</i>

1346
01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:57.913
<i>Soon, selling news became big business.</i>

1347
01:51:58.288 --> 01:52:04.830
Today, India has 105,437
registered publications,


1348
01:52:05.288 --> 01:52:08.413
thousands of radio stations,
TV channels and the internet.


1349
01:52:09.122 --> 01:52:11.663
And they're in a rat race...

1350
01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:14.705
fighting for readership.

1351
01:52:15.122 --> 01:52:18.413
More readers means more money from ads.

1352
01:52:19.497 --> 01:52:23.538
And how do you lure readers?
With the truth?


1353
01:52:24.913 --> 01:52:25.830
No.

1354
01:52:26.622 --> 01:52:29.497
With news that's spicy!

1355
01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:33.497
And how do you do that?

1356
01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:35.955
Easy! With a question mark.

1357
01:52:38.663 --> 01:52:44.663
When I was on bail,
these question marks were on my tail.


1358
01:52:44.747 --> 01:52:46.413
SANJU IN A BRAWL?

1359
01:52:51.372 --> 01:52:53.163
SANJU SOZZLED?

1360
01:52:56.288 --> 01:52:59.913
<i>Dad decided to fight back.</i>

1361
01:52:59.997 --> 01:53:02.705
Mr. Dutt, what a surprise!

1362
01:53:02.788 --> 01:53:04.830
How many pages does your paper have?

1363
01:53:05.747 --> 01:53:07.705
-Twenty four.
-Cut it down to eight.


1364
01:53:08.747 --> 01:53:11.747
Then you won't need
fake news to fill pages.


1365
01:53:12.413 --> 01:53:13.747
Please come.

1366
01:53:15.747 --> 01:53:20.997
If our reportage bothers you, sue us.

1367
01:53:22.622 --> 01:53:24.538
How can I fight you?

1368
01:53:24.622 --> 01:53:26.247
You have James Bond with you.

1369
01:53:27.122 --> 01:53:28.038
James Bond?

1370
01:53:28.122 --> 01:53:31.122
James Bond has a license to kill.

1371
01:53:31.413 --> 01:53:34.288
He has legal immunity.

1372
01:53:34.497 --> 01:53:37.163
Similarly, you have these question marks.

1373
01:53:37.497 --> 01:53:40.330
In Court, you'll state,
"This isn't confirmed news."


1374
01:53:40.413 --> 01:53:43.747
"Just speculation.
Don't miss the question mark."


1375
01:53:43.830 --> 01:53:45.580
"According to sources..."

1376
01:53:48.788 --> 01:53:50.997
These are your James Bond!

1377
01:53:56.788 --> 01:54:00.997
<i>Bandu Boss, I'll be there. 
Tell me when.</i>

1378
01:54:01.163 --> 01:54:04.247
<i>Last day of Ganesha festival.</i>

1379
01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:06.080
<i>Done.</i>

1380
01:54:08.288 --> 01:54:12.913
Your son graces events by gangsters.

1381
01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:16.497
Cops have 60 such phone taps.

1382
01:54:16.913 --> 01:54:20.413
He's not focused on work.
His last 12 films tanked.


1383
01:54:20.913 --> 01:54:26.497
His bail can be revoked.
In short, he's finished!


1384
01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:30.830
Then state that with conviction.

1385
01:54:31.955 --> 01:54:35.163
Put a full stop. 
Not a question mark.

1386
01:54:49.622 --> 01:54:53.663
Mr. Editor, don't write his obituary yet.

1387
01:54:53.747 --> 01:54:55.663
My son will rise again.

1388
01:54:56.288 --> 01:54:59.455
I'll prove you wrong.

1389
01:54:59.788 --> 01:55:01.955
I'm around, and so are you.

1390
01:55:02.122 --> 01:55:03.330
We'll meet again.

1391
01:55:08.955 --> 01:55:13.997
<i>A lousy editor writing me off</i>
<i>was unacceptable to dad.</i>


1392
01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:18.705
<i>He resolved to get
my life back on track.</i>

1393
01:55:18.872 --> 01:55:23.247
If you hobnob with gangsters,
won't the press hound you?


1394
01:55:23.913 --> 01:55:25.330
Gangster? Who, Dad?

1395
01:55:27.788 --> 01:55:29.038
Bandu Boss.

1396
01:55:30.122 --> 01:55:32.122
Aren't you attending his event?

1397
01:55:33.913 --> 01:55:37.372
What's the option? 
They're dangerous.

1398
01:55:38.247 --> 01:55:39.455
Don't go.

1399
01:55:39.788 --> 01:55:42.913
They'll kill me. 
They shot Gulshan Kumar.

1400
01:55:43.163 --> 01:55:46.080
-Fired at Rakesh Roshan.
-Don't go, sonny.


1401
01:55:46.455 --> 01:55:50.205
If the snoopy press
ensures my safety, I won't go.


1402
01:56:11.413 --> 01:56:12.663
Why are we here, Dad?

1403
01:56:12.747 --> 01:56:15.872
When I was to marry your mom,

1404
01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:21.122
a notorious don... 
Mastan, got livid.

1405
01:56:21.913 --> 01:56:24.705
"Nargis is the pride
of the Muslim community."


1406
01:56:25.372 --> 01:56:28.372
"If a Hindu marries her,
we'll slaughter him."


1407
01:56:28.872 --> 01:56:30.955
I called him and said...

1408
01:56:32.122 --> 01:56:35.622
"Let's meet and talk."

1409
01:56:35.788 --> 01:56:40.580
He agreed. 1 a.m... right here.

1410
01:56:41.997 --> 01:56:44.663
-You came here alone?
-No.


1411
01:56:45.163 --> 01:56:47.080
My Master was with me.

1412
01:56:47.622 --> 01:56:49.955
-Which one?
-Sahir Ludhianvi.


1413
01:56:50.538 --> 01:56:53.538
I reached an hour earlier.

1414
01:56:53.955 --> 01:56:57.580
I let Sahir's song
play in my mind on loop.


1415
01:56:58.205 --> 01:57:04.038
When the don arrived,
I said, "I love Nargis deeply."


1416
01:57:04.872 --> 01:57:06.413
"I want to marry her."

1417
01:57:06.913 --> 01:57:09.163
"And I'll keep her happy forever."

1418
01:57:09.663 --> 01:57:13.580
"If to love someone is wrong, shoot me."

1419
01:57:13.872 --> 01:57:16.997
"If right, give me a hug."

1420
01:57:17.580 --> 01:57:19.038
On our wedding day,

1421
01:57:19.413 --> 01:57:21.622
the biggest bouquet...

1422
01:57:23.038 --> 01:57:24.122
came from Mastan!

1423
01:57:26.705 --> 01:57:29.663
-What song was it, Dad?
-Will you sing it?


1424
01:57:30.705 --> 01:57:32.705
Sing along with me.

1425
01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:38.955
<i>Vicious or vile, let no power</i>

1426
01:57:39.038 --> 01:57:41.580
<i>Ever let you cower</i>

1427
01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:45.080
-Dad, not here.
-Come on, catch the beat.


1428
01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:49.747
<i>Vicious or vile, let no power</i>

1429
01:57:49.872 --> 01:57:52.747
<i>Ever let you cower</i>

1430
01:57:53.372 --> 01:58:00.372
<i>Look evil in the eye</i>
<i>Your head held high</i>


1431
01:58:00.872 --> 01:58:07.663
<i>So what if this be your last breath?</i>

1432
01:58:08.455 --> 01:58:15.163
<i>Rejoice, you never died before your death!</i>

1433
01:58:24.288 --> 01:58:30.580
Sonny, go... let Bandu Boss have it.

1434
01:58:30.997 --> 01:58:32.830
He'll never call again.

1435
01:58:32.913 --> 01:58:36.663
<i>Break</i>

1436
01:58:36.747 --> 01:58:40.622
<i>Every shackle</i>

1437
01:58:42.705 --> 01:58:48.622
<i>Smith each into</i>

1438
01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:53.080
<i>A sword</i>

1439
01:58:54.455 --> 01:58:55.497
Stop!

1440
01:58:59.830 --> 01:59:01.038
Hey, the great Sanju!

1441
01:59:01.163 --> 01:59:03.205
Boss, look who's here.

1442
01:59:04.788 --> 01:59:06.122
The star!

1443
01:59:06.747 --> 01:59:08.497
Welcome!

1444
01:59:09.205 --> 01:59:12.705
No calendar at home?
You're ten days early!


1445
01:59:12.788 --> 01:59:16.580
Welcome... sit.

1446
01:59:20.372 --> 01:59:22.747
May I speak in private?

1447
01:59:22.830 --> 01:59:23.997
In private?

1448
01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:26.413
They're family.

1449
01:59:27.872 --> 01:59:29.372
Close your ears.

1450
01:59:31.413 --> 01:59:35.538
We reject condoms
and eject large families.


1451
01:59:36.663 --> 01:59:38.497
Now tell me.

1452
01:59:41.122 --> 01:59:43.163
I can't attend the Ganesha festival.

1453
01:59:45.413 --> 01:59:46.997
Are you sloshed?

1454
01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:49.497
I've already announced to the world.

1455
01:59:49.622 --> 01:59:51.705
My parents are joining, too.

1456
01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:54.497
I too have a father. 
He disapproves.

1457
01:59:57.122 --> 01:59:59.330
He approves when you meet
the gangs in Dubai?


1458
02:00:00.413 --> 02:00:03.247
Did I have a choice? I was scared.

1459
02:00:05.538 --> 02:00:07.497
You ain't scared of me?

1460
02:00:08.622 --> 02:00:10.663
Boys, show him fear.

1461
02:00:32.372 --> 02:00:34.705
Wanna see your brains?

1462
02:00:37.872 --> 02:00:40.955
Blow them out, but first... hear me out.

1463
02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:47.622
If I attend your event,
the press will print...


1464
02:00:47.913 --> 02:00:49.080
"Sanju
-Gangsters Romance."

1465
02:00:49.622 --> 02:00:53.830
If I don't attend, "Gang kills Sanju."

1466
02:00:54.080 --> 02:00:56.122
Either ways, it'll make headlines.

1467
02:00:56.330 --> 02:01:00.330
But, the second headline
won't shame my dad.


1468
02:01:00.913 --> 02:01:02.538
He'll cry gallons.

1469
02:01:03.163 --> 02:01:06.872
But when he faces the world,
his head will be held high.


1470
02:01:07.538 --> 02:01:09.247
Not bowed down in shame.

1471
02:01:11.455 --> 02:01:14.955
If this makes sense... fine.

1472
02:01:18.288 --> 02:01:19.413
If not, shoot me.

1473
02:01:22.955 --> 02:01:25.122
-Boss...
-Shut up!


1474
02:01:31.330 --> 02:01:32.705
I'll leave now.

1475
02:01:33.497 --> 02:01:35.788
If I've overstepped, I'm sorry.

1476
02:01:59.663 --> 02:02:02.663
<i>Bandu Boss never called.</i>

1477
02:02:03.747 --> 02:02:05.497
<i>But he showed up!</i>

1478
02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:13.997
It's a family tradition.

1479
02:02:14.413 --> 02:02:16.705
No murders during the Ganesha fest.

1480
02:02:17.372 --> 02:02:19.330
Decided to kill you after the fest.

1481
02:02:19.788 --> 02:02:21.788
These ten days, 
I only thought of you.

1482
02:02:22.372 --> 02:02:26.372
You risked life to keep
your dad's head unbowed.


1483
02:02:26.788 --> 02:02:29.872
Who does such a stupid thing?

1484
02:02:29.955 --> 02:02:33.080
Head, a few degrees up or down,
what bloody difference?


1485
02:02:35.372 --> 02:02:37.747
I prayed to the Lord for you.

1486
02:02:38.122 --> 02:02:40.580
Told him, "He's one gutsy guy."

1487
02:02:40.830 --> 02:02:44.372
"Help him. Get his charges dropped."

1488
02:02:44.788 --> 02:02:46.872
The Lord said, "Bandu Boss, done!"

1489
02:02:47.997 --> 02:02:49.205
Here are the offerings.

1490
02:02:52.955 --> 02:02:54.538
Success guaranteed!

1491
02:02:54.747 --> 02:02:56.580
-Lord Ganesha...
-Glory be thine!


1492
02:02:56.705 --> 02:02:58.497
Be thine!

1493
02:02:59.247 --> 02:03:00.913
Stay in touch.

1494
02:03:01.122 --> 02:03:02.122
Let's go.

1495
02:03:08.497 --> 02:03:12.163
Get Bandu Boss teary-eyed often.

1496
02:03:12.330 --> 02:03:14.288
Free sweets will follow.

1497
02:03:15.413 --> 02:03:16.580
Sir, it's the director.

1498
02:03:20.372 --> 02:03:21.705
Yes, bro.

1499
02:03:21.788 --> 02:03:23.580
Where are you? 
We are ready to shoot.

1500
02:03:23.663 --> 02:03:26.997
Insane traffic on the highway.

1501
02:03:27.788 --> 02:03:29.830
A truck hit a car.

1502
02:03:32.163 --> 02:03:35.538
Hey, move that taxi.

1503
02:03:36.288 --> 02:03:37.705
Listen.

1504
02:03:37.955 --> 02:03:39.372
I've called the landline.

1505
02:03:42.872 --> 02:03:44.622
Landline's for all and sundry.

1506
02:03:44.705 --> 02:03:46.663
You're my bro, always call on my cell.

1507
02:03:46.747 --> 02:03:49.330
We missed the sunrise shot.

1508
02:03:49.747 --> 02:03:52.288
Shoot it at sunset.

1509
02:03:52.413 --> 02:03:54.372
The audience won't know shit.

1510
02:03:54.455 --> 02:03:57.705
<i>Now hang up or we'll miss the sunset.</i>

1511
02:03:59.163 --> 02:04:02.372
Time to introduce you to Master no. 2.

1512
02:04:03.663 --> 02:04:06.997
He'll teach you to respect work.

1513
02:04:07.372 --> 02:04:09.747
If you keep missing sunrise shoots,

1514
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:12.288
the sun will set on your career.

1515
02:04:12.538 --> 02:04:15.413
Do good work and the press
will change its opinion, too.


1516
02:04:16.205 --> 02:04:17.872
Good work?

1517
02:04:18.205 --> 02:04:19.622
With such trashy scripts.

1518
02:04:21.580 --> 02:04:22.997
Here...

1519
02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:27.747
Kinky King, Rowdy Romeo...

1520
02:04:28.372 --> 02:04:31.788
Munnabhai MBBS, 
Punky Prince...

1521
02:04:31.872 --> 02:04:33.747
Aamir and Shah Rukh grab the best.

1522
02:04:34.122 --> 02:04:38.038
-Do you read these scripts?
-Cover to cover.


1523
02:04:38.163 --> 02:04:41.080
All read and rejected.

1524
02:04:41.538 --> 02:04:44.330
"Munnabhai MBBS." Read this one?

1525
02:04:44.455 --> 02:04:46.872
-I did.
-What's the story?


1526
02:04:49.372 --> 02:04:50.788
It's trash!

1527
02:04:52.288 --> 02:04:54.663
There's a hospital...

1528
02:04:54.788 --> 02:04:59.205
where a patient gets murdered...
every day!


1529
02:04:59.788 --> 02:05:03.663
Then kidneys are stolen.
It's a horror story.


1530
02:05:03.913 --> 02:05:05.497
I need a family film.

1531
02:05:05.788 --> 02:05:09.163
The draft I read has no murders.

1532
02:05:10.372 --> 02:05:15.580
-Why did you read it?
-I'm playing your father in this film.


1533
02:05:16.163 --> 02:05:19.663
I'll set up Master
no. 2 in your car.

1534
02:05:19.747 --> 02:05:23.580
Listen to the song
on loop at full volume.

1535
02:05:31.455 --> 02:05:34.372
<i>If you shirk from work</i>

1536
02:05:36.913 --> 02:05:39.955
<i>You get no perk, you jerk</i>

1537
02:05:40.038 --> 02:05:41.788
Turn it off!

1538
02:05:41.872 --> 02:05:44.747
It's Mr. Dutt's order to play this song
the whole month.


1539
02:05:44.830 --> 02:05:48.330
And check that you lip sync.

1540
02:05:54.788 --> 02:05:56.997
<i>If you shirk from work</i>

1541
02:05:57.080 --> 02:05:58.455
I am singing.

1542
02:05:59.663 --> 02:06:02.330
<i>You get no perk, you jerk</i>

1543
02:06:02.788 --> 02:06:05.372
<i>If duties you duck</i>
<i>You land up in muck</i>


1544
02:06:05.663 --> 02:06:08.330
<i>On bankruptcy's brink</i>
<i>Not a dime for a drink</i>


1545
02:06:08.497 --> 02:06:11.497
<i>Toil hard buddy</i>
<i>Listen to your daddy...</i>


1546
02:06:11.955 --> 02:06:13.913
-Lip sync fine?
-Yes.


1547
02:06:13.997 --> 02:06:16.872
Report to dad. 
Bloody snitch!

1548
02:06:20.538 --> 02:06:23.580
<i>Dad signed this film
after a 12 year gap</i>

1549
02:06:23.747 --> 02:06:26.205
<i>just to discipline me.</i>

1550
02:06:26.330 --> 02:06:30.830
Must an ER patient fill an admit form?

1551
02:06:35.705 --> 02:06:37.663
<i>He was always punctual on the sets.</i>

1552
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:40.122
-Has the hero arrived?
-Yes, sir.


1553
02:06:40.705 --> 02:06:43.830
<i>So I too, had to be on time.</i>

1554
02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:49.288
Shall we rehearse?

1555
02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:57.080
Just for the shot, Dad!

1556
02:06:58.372 --> 02:07:00.997
Hey, pal. No fear, I'm here.

1557
02:07:03.330 --> 02:07:07.288
You lied to me shamelessly for ten years.

1558
02:07:12.788 --> 02:07:17.163
"Now that your father's proud,
why'd you fret?"


1559
02:07:17.372 --> 02:07:20.830
That's my dialogue.
I'm playing the father.


1560
02:07:21.372 --> 02:07:23.247
But, Father...
I couldn't become a doctor."


1561
02:07:23.330 --> 02:07:24.247
Again.

1562
02:07:24.788 --> 02:07:28.330
You lied to me shamelessly for 10 years.

1563
02:07:28.872 --> 02:07:32.663
Now that your father's proud,
why'd you fret?


1564
02:07:32.830 --> 02:07:33.830
Once again?

1565
02:07:33.997 --> 02:07:37.788
<i>Prison time was easier than this.</i>

1566
02:07:37.913 --> 02:07:40.122
<i>Dad's discipline roasted me.</i>

1567
02:07:41.122 --> 02:07:44.955
<i>But, I won't ever forget</i>
<i>that "magic hug" scene.</i>


1568
02:07:45.205 --> 02:07:47.497
Your mom gets a thousand hugs.

1569
02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:50.997
Spare one for dad.

1570
02:07:56.330 --> 02:07:59.622
<i>Neither of us heard it</i>
<i>when the director called, "Cut!"</i>


1571
02:07:59.913 --> 02:08:01.830
<i>We were weeping.</i>

1572
02:08:02.205 --> 02:08:04.913
<i>It was a lifetime since we had hugged.</i>

1573
02:08:13.497 --> 02:08:15.747
...Sanjay Dutt for "Munnabhai MBBS."

1574
02:08:20.622 --> 02:08:21.663
Go on, sonny.

1575
02:08:35.747 --> 02:08:38.830
Mr. Dutt, didn't I tell you
that Sanju will be back!


1576
02:08:39.205 --> 02:08:41.455
Really? Did you?

1577
02:08:41.538 --> 02:08:42.788
Didn't I?

1578
02:08:43.913 --> 02:08:46.622
-I told... someone.
-Who?


1579
02:08:46.788 --> 02:08:48.705
Our Associate Editor.

1580
02:08:48.955 --> 02:08:51.330
Told him to print, "Sanju will be back."

1581
02:08:51.413 --> 02:08:53.747
He must've forgotten.

1582
02:08:53.997 --> 02:08:57.288
Make it tomorrow's headline...
"Sanjay Dutt is back."


1583
02:08:59.997 --> 02:09:02.163
Without a question mark.

1584
02:09:11.205 --> 02:09:12.872
Look, Munnabhai's pop!

1585
02:09:21.872 --> 02:09:23.455
<i>Look, the terrorist's pop!</i>

1586
02:09:27.497 --> 02:09:28.538
What happened, Dad?

1587
02:09:28.622 --> 02:09:33.497
It's the second time
you've made me cry with joy.


1588
02:09:34.830 --> 02:09:39.288
<i>The first time dad cried with joy</i>
<i>was in our preview theater.</i>


1589
02:09:39.663 --> 02:09:43.997
<i>That day a headline read,</i>
<i>"RDX truck at Dutt house."</i>


1590
02:09:56.038 --> 02:10:01.622
<i>Tell the judge that you knew about</i>
<i>the bomb blast conspiracy.</i>


1591
02:10:08.038 --> 02:10:12.663
<i>The first time dad cried with joy</i>
<i>was in our preview theater.</i>


1592
02:10:12.913 --> 02:10:17.122
<i>That day a headline read,</i>
<i>"RDX truck at Dutt house."</i>


1593
02:10:17.455 --> 02:10:20.080
<i>But that's another episode.</i>

1594
02:10:20.288 --> 02:10:21.538
<i>I'll save it for another day.</i>

1595
02:10:21.788 --> 02:10:24.080
<i>Let's get back to dad.</i>

1596
02:10:24.205 --> 02:10:26.622
<i>I got another chance to make dad happy.</i>

1597
02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:31.080
<i>Dad was being honored</i>
<i>at a Consulate dinner.</i>


1598
02:10:32.372 --> 02:10:34.997
You guys never praise me.

1599
02:10:35.372 --> 02:10:37.538
So, here I am as chief guest.

1600
02:10:37.747 --> 02:10:42.038
<i>Dad was unaware, his son would</i>
<i>sing his praises tonight!</i>


1601
02:10:42.122 --> 02:10:46.122
<i>I was to make the introduction speech.</i>

1602
02:10:58.080 --> 02:10:59.247
Dad, I'll be back.

1603
02:11:00.580 --> 02:11:02.663
Sir, there's a minor problem.

1604
02:11:02.872 --> 02:11:06.830
Today's headline said, "Blast suspect
to attend diplomatic event."


1605
02:11:07.747 --> 02:11:12.080
The Embassy wanted you off the guest list.

1606
02:11:12.538 --> 02:11:15.705
We said, "That would be rude."

1607
02:11:16.372 --> 02:11:19.288
"We'll seat him away from the diplomats."

1608
02:11:32.205 --> 02:11:34.372
My speech... When's that?

1609
02:11:55.288 --> 02:11:57.913
Sonny, what's the problem?

1610
02:11:59.122 --> 02:12:02.872
I'm right here. 
Read out your speech.

1611
02:12:05.372 --> 02:12:06.872
I wanted everyone to hear it.

1612
02:12:12.497 --> 02:12:15.288
Learn to ignore such people.

1613
02:12:15.997 --> 02:12:22.163
Time for Master no. 3.
I'll set the song in your car.


1614
02:12:22.747 --> 02:12:23.788
Anand Bakshi.

1615
02:12:23.872 --> 02:12:28.455
He'll teach you to deal with humiliation.
Okay?


1616
02:12:31.038 --> 02:12:33.413
Sanju...

1617
02:12:38.830 --> 02:12:42.788
Hey, pal. No fear, I'm here!

1618
02:12:44.580 --> 02:12:45.663
Go, sleep.

1619
02:12:50.913 --> 02:12:53.830
<i>Wish I'd read him the speech,</i>

1620
02:12:54.330 --> 02:12:56.913
<i>for... the next morning,</i>
<i>he didn't wake up.</i>


1621
02:14:08.163 --> 02:14:10.038
<i>If life had a rewind button...</i>

1622
02:14:10.747 --> 02:14:13.955
<i>I'd go back and read him the speech!</i>

1623
02:14:20.788 --> 02:14:25.288
Today, I'll try the impossible...
an attempt to thank dad.


1624
02:14:25.747 --> 02:14:28.913
In the past, I never found the words.

1625
02:14:28.997 --> 02:14:33.788
To define what dad's done for me...
every word fell short.


1626
02:14:40.872 --> 02:14:42.788
<i>...a wife dying in the hospital,</i>

1627
02:14:43.372 --> 02:14:45.663
<i>a son destroyed by drugs.</i>

1628
02:14:46.163 --> 02:14:48.538
<i>Dad fought all alone.</i>

1629
02:14:48.997 --> 02:14:51.372
He's the reason I'm alive.

1630
02:14:53.330 --> 02:14:57.080
Tried to thank him then
but couldn't find the words.


1631
02:14:57.455 --> 02:15:00.080
<i>Dad walked long peace marches…</i>

1632
02:15:00.663 --> 02:15:03.497
<i>from Hiroshima to Nagasaki...</i>
<i>Mumbai to Amritsar.</i>


1633
02:15:04.413 --> 02:15:07.080
<i>But none wore off
his shoes as much as</i>

1634
02:15:07.538 --> 02:15:09.663
the jostle between courts and cops.

1635
02:15:10.455 --> 02:15:13.455
<i>Legal costs forced dad to sell his house.</i>

1636
02:15:13.622 --> 02:15:15.580
<i>Not once did he complain!</i>

1637
02:15:16.247 --> 02:15:21.997
Wanted to thank him then
but couldn't find the words.


1638
02:15:22.955 --> 02:15:27.413
Now, after a lifetime,
I've found the words.


1639
02:15:31.997 --> 02:15:36.247
You deserved a better son, Dad.

1640
02:15:37.205 --> 02:15:40.705
<i>One who'd support you... not be a burden.</i>

1641
02:15:41.663 --> 02:15:44.830
<i>One known for his honesty,</i>
<i>not his travesties.</i>


1642
02:15:45.413 --> 02:15:48.455
One more like you and less like me.

1643
02:15:55.038 --> 02:15:58.247
That son would've never loved you as much

1644
02:15:58.330 --> 02:16:00.580
as this no-good sonny does!

1645
02:16:01.122 --> 02:16:02.538
<i>I could never say it, but...</i>

1646
02:16:06.163 --> 02:16:07.580
You're my strength,

1647
02:16:08.372 --> 02:16:09.622
<i>my solace,</i>

1648
02:16:10.497 --> 02:16:11.830
my pride.

1649
02:16:11.913 --> 02:16:13.413
You're my world, Dad.

1650
02:16:18.163 --> 02:16:19.413
Love you, sonny.

1651
02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:32.038
<i>Had dad lived another year,</i>

1652
02:16:32.122 --> 02:16:35.288
<i>he'd have witnessed what he yearned for.</i>

1653
02:16:39.497 --> 02:16:42.497
...I do not find
you to be a terrorist.

1654
02:16:47.663 --> 02:16:49.580
<i>I was acquitted from the Terror Act.</i>

1655
02:16:49.955 --> 02:16:54.038
<i>I got six years under the Arms Act.</i>

1656
02:16:54.372 --> 02:16:57.372
<i>The judge clearly said</i>
<i>I was not a terrorist.</i>


1657
02:16:58.038 --> 02:16:59.288
<i>But the next morning,</i>

1658
02:16:59.455 --> 02:17:03.038
<i>no headline read "Dutt not a terrorist."</i>

1659
02:17:05.288 --> 02:17:09.622
<i>All said, "Dutt gets</i>
<i>six years in the blast case."</i>


1660
02:17:12.330 --> 02:17:14.580
Till date, I'm branded a terrorist.

1661
02:17:20.705 --> 02:17:25.538
Master no. 3 was to teach me
to deal with insults.


1662
02:17:27.163 --> 02:17:31.372
But with dad's death,
that song remains a mystery.


1663
02:17:32.122 --> 02:17:36.997
If you can crack that song, do tell.

1664
02:17:37.497 --> 02:17:41.747
Until tomorrow,
Sanju says, "Adios, amigos."


1665
02:17:57.413 --> 02:17:58.997
I want to meet Sanju.

1666
02:18:19.372 --> 02:18:20.538
How are you?

1667
02:18:20.788 --> 02:18:23.288
They don't let me step out,
the rest is fine.


1668
02:18:23.413 --> 02:18:27.538
Yeah. Sticklers for rules!
Weren't letting me in, either.


1669
02:18:28.038 --> 02:18:30.038
Missing me? Boyfriend vamoosed?

1670
02:18:32.580 --> 02:18:34.080
I'm no Pinky.

1671
02:18:36.163 --> 02:18:38.872
-You met Kamli?
-Yes.


1672
02:18:38.955 --> 02:18:40.663
In your recording, you say...

1673
02:18:41.413 --> 02:18:47.038
on the day the RDX news appeared,
your dad cried with joy.


1674
02:18:47.122 --> 02:18:48.330
Yes.

1675
02:18:48.413 --> 02:18:49.830
Kamlesh has a different version.

1676
02:18:49.913 --> 02:18:52.413
When he came to the preview theater,

1677
02:18:52.872 --> 02:18:56.330
your dad was urging you
to confess in court


1678
02:18:56.497 --> 02:18:59.330
that you knew about
the bomb blasts conspiracy.


1679
02:19:06.413 --> 02:19:07.497
The moron!

1680
02:19:08.913 --> 02:19:09.997
Get Kamli here.

1681
02:19:11.372 --> 02:19:14.913
-Tell me about it.
-No. I'll tell him directly.


1682
02:19:14.997 --> 02:19:17.747
It's hard to get permission.

1683
02:19:21.747 --> 02:19:24.372
Remember this number, 88.0.

1684
02:19:24.622 --> 02:19:26.372
-What's that?
-A radio frequency.


1685
02:19:26.455 --> 02:19:28.663
There's an FM mic in our studio.

1686
02:19:29.205 --> 02:19:34.580
Park close to the prison walls
and tune in.


1687
02:19:37.747 --> 02:19:38.872
Kamlesh won't come.

1688
02:19:40.455 --> 02:19:45.538
Tell him... 6th June. 
He won't refuse.

1689
02:19:48.705 --> 02:19:52.788
It's his dad's birthday.
Bloody emotional blackmailer!


1690
02:19:53.330 --> 02:19:54.455
Will you come?

1691
02:20:28.997 --> 02:20:31.080
<i>Howdy, Yerwada!</i>

1692
02:20:31.205 --> 02:20:35.288
<i>This is your buddy, Sanju!</i>

1693
02:20:38.788 --> 02:20:41.747
Today's topic is "friendship."

1694
02:20:42.163 --> 02:20:44.288
My best friend was Kamli.

1695
02:20:45.205 --> 02:20:49.122
Great guy. But fell prey to drugs.

1696
02:20:49.997 --> 02:20:52.913
<i>No... not the psychotropic drugs.</i>

1697
02:20:53.330 --> 02:20:59.913
But the ones that are slid
under our doors, daily.


1698
02:21:00.747 --> 02:21:02.913
<i>We have them with our morning tea.</i>

1699
02:21:03.413 --> 02:21:06.747
Drugs called "News."

1700
02:21:07.622 --> 02:21:09.413
<i>These drugs are sold on TV too.</i>

1701
02:21:09.747 --> 02:21:14.122
Haven't you heard those
cacophonous debates


1702
02:21:14.413 --> 02:21:16.705
that numb our minds?

1703
02:21:17.455 --> 02:21:20.622
Courts take years
to just understand a case.


1704
02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:24.455
But these panelists
pass verdicts in an hour.


1705
02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:26.955
Back then, a headline said...

1706
02:21:32.622 --> 02:21:34.497
<i>It was fake news.</i>

1707
02:21:34.580 --> 02:21:38.247
No cop, no prosecutor,
no witness ever said


1708
02:21:38.330 --> 02:21:40.455
there was a truck
with RDX at my house.

1709
02:21:41.080 --> 02:21:42.247
<i>So, why this headline?</i>

1710
02:21:42.580 --> 02:21:47.538
During riots, a truck with relief material
was parked at our house.


1711
02:21:49.538 --> 02:21:51.913
<i>Some jerk spread a rumor it had RDX.</i>

1712
02:21:51.997 --> 02:21:54.997
And a journo printed this spicy news.

1713
02:21:55.080 --> 02:21:58.288
Read my Supreme Court judgment.

1714
02:21:58.580 --> 02:22:00.955
I was never accused of possessing RDX!

1715
02:22:02.788 --> 02:22:07.080
But which journo bothers with facts?

1716
02:22:07.330 --> 02:22:10.205
All they want is "Breaking News!"

1717
02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:14.622
This headline worked like a drug.

1718
02:22:15.663 --> 02:22:18.497
In Kamli's head,
I morphed into a terrorist.


1719
02:22:20.747 --> 02:22:23.497
He put a full-stop to our friendship.

1720
02:22:24.538 --> 02:22:28.163
Didn't even notice
that the headline had a question mark!


1721
02:22:38.747 --> 02:22:40.997
<i>This news shattered dad.</i>

1722
02:22:41.413 --> 02:22:44.538
In desperation, he brought in a lawyer.

1723
02:22:45.913 --> 02:22:48.622
-What's this?
-Your ticket to freedom.


1724
02:22:48.913 --> 02:22:50.830
Sign and turn approver.

1725
02:22:50.913 --> 02:22:53.163
-Approver?
-Government witness.


1726
02:22:55.788 --> 02:23:00.538
Tell the Court, you knew about
the bomb blast conspiracy.


1727
02:23:02.330 --> 02:23:04.705
Kamlesh, please wait outside.

1728
02:23:09.080 --> 02:23:12.997
-I knew nothing about the bomb blasts.
-But tell the Court that you knew.


1729
02:23:13.372 --> 02:23:16.372
Tell them who got the RDX,
who made the bombs,


1730
02:23:16.788 --> 02:23:18.163
and who planted them.

1731
02:23:18.247 --> 02:23:22.163
-I know nothing!
-I'll give you the names.


1732
02:23:22.497 --> 02:23:25.705
You help the State with missing links.

1733
02:23:25.788 --> 02:23:30.663
In return, the State
will let you go scot-free.


1734
02:23:31.788 --> 02:23:35.288
-I'll be branded a terrorist.
-You're already branded.


1735
02:23:35.372 --> 02:23:38.122
It's a lie, a sign
will make it the truth.

1736
02:23:39.163 --> 02:23:41.288
The country will spit on me.

1737
02:23:42.122 --> 02:23:43.580
Leave the country.

1738
02:23:43.913 --> 02:23:45.497
London, Kenya... Pick a place.

1739
02:23:46.663 --> 02:23:51.622
And dad? My sisters? 
Dad, heard that?

1740
02:23:51.705 --> 02:23:54.997
Don't worry about us. 
Leave the country.

1741
02:24:00.747 --> 02:24:04.372
Sir, I don't have a law degree.

1742
02:24:05.122 --> 02:24:06.955
In fact, I'm a college dropout.

1743
02:24:07.205 --> 02:24:10.163
But I know, this is rotten advice.

1744
02:24:10.830 --> 02:24:14.038
I brand him "Terrorist's pop"
and run away?


1745
02:24:14.663 --> 02:24:16.288
People will hate dad.

1746
02:24:16.497 --> 02:24:19.913
His life's work, respect...
All down the drain!


1747
02:24:19.997 --> 02:24:22.497
-Listen to me...
-You listen to me.


1748
02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:25.830
Get lost!
You might be a great lawyer,


1749
02:24:25.913 --> 02:24:29.622
but with a broken nose,
you'll look like a clown.


1750
02:24:36.538 --> 02:24:39.038
You're going to pay for this.

1751
02:24:53.538 --> 02:24:54.705
What happened, Dad?

1752
02:24:56.038 --> 02:24:57.455
Ace, sonny!

1753
02:25:07.372 --> 02:25:09.955
<i>For the first time,</i>
<i>my father cried with joy.</i>


1754
02:25:10.747 --> 02:25:12.413
That day, I was his hero.

1755
02:25:14.622 --> 02:25:17.330
The same day,
I turned villain for my friend.


1756
02:25:18.372 --> 02:25:22.413
Hey, Kamli. Hope you can hear me.

1757
02:25:23.955 --> 02:25:25.538
When I come out...

1758
02:25:27.330 --> 02:25:29.122
meet me once, buddy.

1759
02:25:30.913 --> 02:25:32.705
If you do, I'll be happy.

1760
02:25:34.413 --> 02:25:37.830
If you don't,
I'll live with your fond memories.


1761
02:25:40.413 --> 02:25:45.788
I'll remember, the first nude girl
my friend saw was 91.


1762
02:25:48.747 --> 02:25:52.455
I'll remember, he perked me up
with vodka-infused tea.


1763
02:25:54.663 --> 02:26:00.663
And to meet me, he bought an air-ticket
with the pennies saved for his first car.


1764
02:26:02.913 --> 02:26:06.163
Hey, Kamli. We're getting old, bro.

1765
02:26:08.497 --> 02:26:10.372
Give me one last hug.

1766
02:26:18.372 --> 02:26:22.163
Tiger, this one's for you.

1767
02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:26.955
<i>On the pathway of time,</i>
<i>At this bend</i>


1768
02:26:27.330 --> 02:26:31.538
<i>I am glad I met such a friend</i>

1769
02:26:32.163 --> 02:26:36.330
<i>Scars are healed</i>
<i>And sorrows end</i>


1770
02:26:36.413 --> 02:26:40.830
<i>Just at the thought</i>
<i>I have such a friend</i>


1771
02:26:40.913 --> 02:26:45.288
<i>On the pathway of time,</i>
<i>At this bend</i>


1772
02:26:45.538 --> 02:26:49.747
<i>I am lucky to find such a friend</i>

1773
02:27:38.955 --> 02:27:40.413
Sanju, take care.

1774
02:28:01.788 --> 02:28:03.913
Sanju! Here...

1775
02:28:04.372 --> 02:28:07.830
A picture, please!

1776
02:28:17.330 --> 02:28:18.330
<i>Sanju!</i>

1777
02:29:09.913 --> 02:29:10.872
Did you marry?

1778
02:29:12.080 --> 02:29:13.247
Opened your account?

1779
02:29:16.830 --> 02:29:19.205
Bam-bam without marriage?

1780
02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:23.247
At 80, we'll go to the holy river
to wash our sins.


1781
02:29:23.330 --> 02:29:26.080
If I don't sin, what'll I wash?
My underwear?


1782
02:29:29.663 --> 02:29:31.413
One pic, please!

1783
02:29:33.663 --> 02:29:35.455
Look here.

1784
02:29:43.538 --> 02:29:44.455
The book?

1785
02:29:46.622 --> 02:29:48.580
Master no. 3's song...

1786
02:29:51.163 --> 02:29:52.580
Named the book the same.

1787
02:29:53.663 --> 02:29:54.747
I've cracked it, too.

1788
02:29:56.413 --> 02:29:58.580
Really? Which song?

1789
02:29:58.663 --> 02:30:02.872
Hey, terrorist! 
Give me a bloody pic!

1790
02:30:07.288 --> 02:30:09.372
<i>Let them talk</i>

1791
02:30:09.580 --> 02:30:11.080
<i>Let them mock</i>

1792
02:30:11.580 --> 02:30:13.747
<i>The path beckons</i>

1793
02:30:13.830 --> 02:30:16.205
<i>You just walk</i>

1794
02:30:17.413 --> 02:30:18.288
Let's go, Kamli.

1795
02:30:21.455 --> 02:30:25.913
<i>Let them talk</i>

1796
02:30:26.663 --> 02:30:29.497
<i>Let them mock</i>

1797
02:30:32.205 --> 02:30:37.372
<i>The path beckons</i>

1798
02:30:37.663 --> 02:30:42.705
<i>You just walk</i>

1799
02:30:49.955 --> 02:30:51.205
Papa, what's this?

1800
02:30:52.913 --> 02:30:56.372
A story of two dads.

1801
02:30:56.955 --> 02:30:59.538
Your dad and my dad.

1802
02:31:00.497 --> 02:31:02.163
Read it someday.

1803
02:31:02.497 --> 02:31:05.747
And be like my
dad, not like your dad.

1804
02:31:09.205 --> 02:31:11.497
Your son resembles your dad.

1805
02:31:11.580 --> 02:31:13.330
It's him, reincarnated.

1806
02:31:18.955 --> 02:31:20.205
Just kidding.

1807
02:32:02.580 --> 02:32:05.455
<i>Woke up this morning</i>
<i>Opened the newspaper</i>


1808
02:32:05.705 --> 02:32:08.497
<i>One fake news</i>

<i>"Dutt drowned in booze"</i>
<i>Was headline news</i>

<i>Snooze turned to Booze!</i>

1814

<i>Who was the jerk</i>
<i>Who did this dirty work?</i>


1815

<i>The paper just said:</i>

<i>Who is this Mr. Sources?</i>

1817

<i>What are his resources?</i>

1818
02:32:36.580 --> 02:32:39.538
<i>Who turns a local spar</i>
<i>Into a global war</i>

<i>If a tabloid carries your mug</i>

<i>Mr. Sources has it figured</i>

1829

<i>Repeats a lie till truth is buggered</i>

1830
