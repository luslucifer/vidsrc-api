1
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.129
It was a nightmare.
So many dead people.


2
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.629
So many victims.
It all started a few days ago...


3
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.829
when I came here for a rave.

4
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.830
And, now, all that remains
is the rotten smell of death.


5
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.429
You must stop Curien...

6
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.930
or else something terrible will happen!

7
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.029
Nice. So, where are they, dude?
We're going to miss the boat.


8
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.729
Greg and Simon.

9
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.429
Greg's the guy
I played ball with in college.


10
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.929
A good guy, if not a little goofy.

11
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.329
Simon. They say God doesn't give
with two hands, and they were right.


12
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.230
He got the looks,
but not much between those ears.


13
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.429
Cynthia... Greg's girlfriend.
Pure eye candy.


14
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.229
I am Simon.

15
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.729
Karma. Thinks she's Foxy Brown.

16
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.629
She has a crush on Simon, but Simon
only has eyes for Alicia, my ex.


17
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.029
We broke up a few weeks ago
so I could study and she could fence.


18
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.029
She loves it.
I don't see what it's good for.


19
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.430
Anyone have one of those invitations
with the map on it?


20
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.929
Are you sure this is where
the boat's supposed to leave from?


21
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.729
Maybe Johnnie gave you the wrong info.

22
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.130
Yeah, hon.
I am pretty sure.


23
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.829
It says here the boat
doesn't leave until 5:00.


24
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.629
Yeah, and it's 5:15 now, Simon.

25
00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.329
Shit. We're so fucked.

26
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.329
They missed the boat to the rave.

27
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.129
If only they decided
to stay back in Seattle...


28
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.230
they'd all be alive today.

29
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.330
Unbelievable. It's going on all weekend.
You got to come.


30
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.229
And you will never guess who's here.

31
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.729
Hello? The cell phone reception's
for shit out here.


32
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.229
Hello, sweetie? I am losing you.
Are you there?


33
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.729
Hello? Shit!

34
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.330
Now, where was it
you wanted to take me to?


35
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.229
I was trying my best
to function as a single guy should.


36
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.130
But at the back of my head, something
was nibbling away at my subconscious.


37
00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.530
Hello?

38
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.329
What you doing over there?

39
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.529
Good evening.
Beautiful day, isn't it?


40
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.129
You got yourself some sort
of hearing disability?


41
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.029
I asked you a question.

42
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.029
I have come to charter your boat, sir.

43
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.929
You do, huh?
Well, that's too bad...


44
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.829
because this here's a fishing boat,
not the Pacific Princess.


45
00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.929
Why don't you try the yellow pages?

46
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.629
We got to get to this party on an island,
and we were hoping to use your boat.


47
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.729
You're not the sharpest tool
in the shed, are you?


48
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.029
I said, shove off.
Or don't you sprechen Sie Englisch?


49
00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.329
Why don't you just name your price,
and we can skip...


50
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.129
the old-man-on-the-sea routine.

51
00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.629
A man's got to eat, right?

52
00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.629
What part of "shove off"
didn't you understand?


53
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.829
Hold it.

54
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.830
Geez. Who's the U-boat commander?

55
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.530
- What?
- How much?


56
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.729
$300 sound fair?

57
00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.429
- About 600 might.
- Six hundred? No way.


58
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.229
No one is talking to you.
Where are you headed, girls?


59
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.929
- Huh?
- I don't know. We got this map.


60
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.229
It's somewhere in the San Juans.
You must know where that is, right?


61
00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.729
You crazy?

62
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.329
- They crazy.
- No, I don't think so.


63
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.629
- Excuse me?
- I said, forget it.


64
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.729
Yeah, forget it. Forget it.

65
00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:21.629
- That means stop talking, start walking.
- Why?


66
00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.329
Why? Why? Why?
They always ask "why."


67
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.729
You know what they call this island?

68
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.129
Isle del Morte.

69
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.129
Morte. That's Spanish for "death,"
in case you don't speak Mexican.


70
00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:38.029
Well, listen, friend,
I got me an island to catch right here.


71
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.129
And if this is some lame attempt
to hit me up for more cash...


72
00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.029
It ain't.

73
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.029
There ain't enough cash in the world
to make us go back there.


74
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.029
- Keep the cash. Keep the cash.
- Let's get out of here.


75
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.530
Fuck it. A grand.

76
00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.129
What do you say 500 now,
and another five on the way back?


77
00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.629
You can be mighty persuasive
if you want to be, Mr...


78
00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:03.730
- Simon Cruz. And you are?
- Kirk's the name.


79
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.129
Wait, wait. Captain Kirk?

80
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.730
Does that make him Mr. Spock?

81
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.430
I don't like no Captain Kirk jokes.

82
00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.230
Now, let's shove off before
you say something else you will regret.


83
00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.330
All right.

84
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.130
It's all good.

85
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:33.630
Cap'n! Cap'n!

86
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.729
I am not going.
I am not going.


87
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.929
There's evil spirits on that island.

88
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:45.629
You just get the deck lines and let me
worry about the evil spirits, okay?


89
00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.629
Ahoy there, Captain Kirk.

90
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.429
This is the
United States Marine Patrol.


91
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.930
Stand down and prepare
to be boarded, Captain.


92
00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.129
Oh, shit!

93
00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.929
What are you going to do?

94
00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:05.829
We have no choice.
We got to do what the lady says.


95
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.029
It will delay our departure
for a while, though.


96
00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.729
Delay us?
For how long?


97
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:15.829
Well, I imagine they're looking
for guns, drugs, who knows what.


98
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.929
It will probably take them a few hours.

99
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:20.730
And that's only
if they don't find nothing.


100
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.729
How much to lose them?

101
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:26.929
Did you forget what today is?

102
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.029
You can lose them, right?

103
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.329
Sure I can.

104
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.929
Who's talking, Alexander Hamilton,
Ben Franklin or you?


105
00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.629
- It's the second Friday of the month.!
- Do it.


106
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.629
Just a routine inspection, Kirk.

107
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.229
Don't even think
of leaving my harbor.


108
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:48.230
Heave to.! Where the hell
do you think you're going?


109
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.030
Heave to.!

110
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:59.130
This is Casper.
McGyvers and I are moving out. Over.


111
00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:06.429
Hate to break this to you, kid,
but I would have done it for free.


112
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.529
The lady needs to dine
on a humble pie once in a while.


113
00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:13.729
- So you have run into her before?
- Run into her?


114
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.329
Hell yeah.
She's had a hard-on for me...


115
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.329
ever since we got out of the service...

116
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.330
and I didn't start working
for Uncle Sam like she did.


117
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.830
Can't blame her for still
getting wet over me, can you?


118
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.430
Sweet.

119
00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.929
- Come on.
- Come on what?


120
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.429
Let's go swimming.

121
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:49.930
Now?

122
00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:55.930
You're crazy.
You're pretty enough to eat.


123
00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.830
- You're nuts, baby.
- Come on.


124
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.730
All right.

125
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.230
Oh, yeah.

126
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:20.930
Come on.

127
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:27.430
Oh, my God.
That's cold, baby.


128
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.829
Come on, you big wimp.

129
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.829
No, you go.
You have a good swim, babe.


130
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.429
Yeah, fine.

131
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.229
It's fine once you get in.
Come on, Matt.


132
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.930
You're no fun.

133
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.029
He's heading out to
the San Juan Islands, Cap.


134
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.629
Just maintain speed and distance.

135
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.830
I don't want him to make us yet.

136
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.930
- Cynthia's such a trooper.
- Don't come near me.


137
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.129
Must have eaten something
back at the...


138
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:20.429
You know what?
Whatever you say, baby.


139
00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.330
- God, it's cold.
- I know.


140
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.929
Greg, you look like shit, man.
Here.


141
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.530
Have another beer.
This will make you feel better.


142
00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.930
On my face!

143
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.330
Oh, yeah.

144
00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.330
- Get back here.
- Come on, Matt!


145
00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:13.230
Come on, Matt.
Don't play games.


146
00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.230
Matt, where are you?

147
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.230
What a mess.
What an idiot.


148
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.629
Did you get
a real good peek there, perv?


149
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:45.529
I want to give this to you.

150
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.829
- What's this for?
- It's for your protection.


151
00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.629
It's okay.
I am on the pill.


152
00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.929
It will ward off evil spirits.

153
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:56.630
It will protect you
and your friends from harm.


154
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.830
Whatever, Gandalf.

155
00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.330
Matt, where are you?

156
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.329
I am lost.
Where are you?


157
00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.430
What is that?

158
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.230
What is this?

159
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:49.930
Are you in there?

160
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.130
Are you in there?

161
00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:05.330
Is that you, Matt?

162
00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.330
Oh, my God!

163
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.329
Hey, Cap, I can get
a little closer to them.


164
00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:00.630
Yeah. Let's keep our distance
and see where he's heading.


165
00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.130
- Slow down, slow down.
- Come on.


166
00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:16.330
Did you hear that?

167
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:52.829
- Shallow water!
- Okay, Salish.


168
00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.630
Hey, guys, there it is.

169
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.730
Yes!

170
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.430
Yes! Finally!

171
00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.629
Easy, now.

172
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:11.230
Almost there.

173
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.330
Shut it down!

174
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.130
- I am so excited!
- Finally!


175
00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.929
I know where they're docking. Drop me
off on the other side of the island.


176
00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:36.429
- You want me to radio for backup?
- Nah.


177
00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:39.530
I think I can handle Victor myself.

178
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:49.329
- Okeydoke.
- They're on their way.


179
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:52.429
What do you want to do now?

180
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.629
Let's go. I found a spot
for our merchandise.


181
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.929
Start unloading.
If Casper comes after us...


182
00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:03.130
she won't find anything
left on board to arrest us for.


183
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.529
Yeah, right up here.

184
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.530
Wait. Wait.
Let me see that a second.


185
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.829
Well, you're obviously no cartographer.

186
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.730
- What?
- Come on. It's this way.


187
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.029
- Smart too, isn't she?
- Yep.


188
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.330
Smart enough not to get involved
with the likes of you, bro.


189
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.530
- What's this?
- Come on.


190
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:57.429
- Smells like someone farted up there.
- Look at all these bubbles.


191
00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.430
It's disgusting.

192
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.030
Seems like a storm's coming up.

193
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.729
Maybe so.
But that's all right.


194
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:32.229
Keeps Casper off our ass
if she tries coming after us...


195
00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:34.229
while we blow on out of here.

196
00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.829
What about the kids?
We can't leave them alone.


197
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.629
This is a bad island.

198
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:43.329
I ain't waiting around for them, not if
we have a chance to slip past Casper.


199
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.829
- You'd better keep unloading.
- All right.


200
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:48.129
Fine.

201
00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:51.730
Then we will come back next week
when the heat is off, huh?


202
00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.430
- You hear something?
- No, nothing.


203
00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:16.629
- Where is everyone?
- Come on, Karma.


204
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.029
I can't believe this.

205
00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:20.429
It's their loss. We have
this entire place to ourselves...


206
00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:25.029
to dance the night away,
and I intend to put it to good use.


207
00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.829
- I am not so sure that's a good idea.
- You would say that.


208
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.429
Do you mind if
everybody isn't miserable, like you?


209
00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.229
Yeah, you know what?
I remember when she used to be fun.


210
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.730
When was that, kindergarten?

211
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:39.330
How funny.
You're funny.


212
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:44.129
I think something bad's
happened here.


213
00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.030
Like what?

214
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:54.229
Well, they sure as hell did not
go to 7-11 to get more booze...


215
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.329
because the keg is full.

216
00:20:58.330 --> 00:20:59.929
- Right on.
- Cheers.


217
00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:01.929
- Chin-chin.
- Salud.!


218
00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:05.329
- L'chaim.!
- Well, what the fuck?


219
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:09.029
Doesn't this bother any of you?

220
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.129
We're on the island where the rave of
the year's supposed to be happening...


221
00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:13.229
but it's completely deserted.

222
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.529
Yeah, it worries me.
It worries me there aren't any mixers.


223
00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:17.829
Simon cannot survive on Bud alone.

224
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.030
Speak for yourself, dude.

225
00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.929
I don't know about you, but I am going to
go find out where everyone went.


226
00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.429
Okay? Is anyone else coming?

227
00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:20.729
Hell no.
Me and Cyn are going to...


228
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:23.729
groove to some funky tunes
all night long, right, baby doll?


229
00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:26.229
You know it, sugarplum.

230
00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.929
Okay, you know what?
I am coming with you.


231
00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:32.329
I am starting to get diabetes
from all this "sugar, sugar" over here.


232
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.829
- What about you, Studly Doolittle?
- Three's not company in this case.


233
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.929
I think I will join you.

234
00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:39.629
Good. We need a big,
strong man to protect us.


235
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.229
Problem is, there's never a big,
strong man around when you need one.


236
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.530
All right, let's go.

237
00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.330
Why do I always end up
doing this shit work?


238
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.230
Cap'n, is that you?

239
00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.729
Hello, Cleveland!

240
00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:43.729
- Cut it out.
- What? Why?


241
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.029
Because I said so.

242
00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.830
Said so, huh?
Maybe I should just...


243
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:53.829
Wait, wait, wait.

244
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.829
I think I feel some rain coming.

245
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:59.929
Why don't we... I think it might...
I think it might rain.


246
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:03.030
Why don't we go somewhere
where we won't get wet?


247
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:06.530
Too late.

248
00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:16.729
Close the Velcro.
Beautiful Velcro.


249
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.129
- We are going to do the humpity-bumpity.
- Come on, baby.


250
00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.130
The humpity-bumpity!

251
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:27.030
- Yeah, baby!
- One, two, three!


252
00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:32.229
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What if the others come back?


253
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:35.429
- I can be quick.
- What else is new?


254
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.929
Hey, don't...
Don't take it personal, Greg.


255
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:42.129
- A lot of men have these problems.
- I just got to take a piss.


256
00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:44.629
Not in here, you idiot!
Go pee in the bushes!


257
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:46.229
Christ, I just...

258
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:49.029
I just got to go
and take a piss is all.

259
00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:52.129
- All this beer's got to go somewhere.
- For God's sakes.


260
00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:53.830
Be right back.

261
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.230
- Hello?
- It's so quiet.


262
00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:07.329
It's a gorgeous night.
Why don't we play for a little while?


263
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:08.629
Shall we?

264
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:12.029
Why don't you just stick to
playing with yourself for now?


265
00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:16.130
- By the way, what's with the accent?
- I don't know.


266
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.630
Salish, are you done yet?

267
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.029
Better hurry back, baby.

268
00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:33.130
Mama's going to give it to you.

269
00:26:52.030 --> 00:26:53.930
Greg, you're scaring me.

270
00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.430
Come on, baby.

271
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.729
- Will you get a load of that?
- What the hell is it?


272
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.729
Looks like it was built
a millennia ago.


273
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.229
Simon, it's centuries.

274
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.229
Right. Well, that's what I meant.

275
00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:22.030
Should we go in?

276
00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:26.029
I am not going in there.

277
00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.730
Unless there's a spa and a 24-hour
room service, you're on your own, hon.


278
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:32.729
Well, are you coming,
or am I going in myself?


279
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.129
Didn't you ever watch Scooby Doo?

280
00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:38.430
This is so not a good idea.

281
00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:48.030
I am completely
not in favor of doing this.


282
00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:59.130
Well, the candles are lit.
I mean, someone must be home.


283
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:12.230
Hello?

284
00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:17.230
Alicia, watch out!

285
00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:22.930
What the fuck?

286
00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.229
What the hell are you doing here?

287
00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:30.230
- Where is everyone?
- Shut the door!


288
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.929
You broke my glasses.
Great. Nice.


289
00:28:34.930 --> 00:28:37.730
Okay, what is going on here?

290
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.929
We will show you.

291
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.129
Come on.

292
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.430
I have got it on tape.

293
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:55.930
Sorry. I have a lot of footage here.
I will just fast-forward.


294
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.829
Everyone was partying, you know.

295
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.429
Drinking and dancing
and just hanging out, having fun.


296
00:29:06.430 --> 00:29:09.929
And then these things came
and they attacked the rave.


297
00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.229
They started killing everybody.
Those of us that could get away did.


298
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:16.230
We ran. We finally got to the boat,
but it wasn't there.


299
00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:20.229
These things, they just kept
coming and coming and killing.


300
00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:23.429
We found this house.
We ran inside and tried to hide.


301
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.429
That's when you guys came.
We thought you were more of them.


302
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:29.229
"Them"? Who the hell is "them"?

303
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:32.929
"Who"? Try "what."

304
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:36.529
- Rudy, they were dead people.
- Okay, guys, you saw the tape.


305
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.229
Those are reanimated corpses just like
out of a fucking Romero movie.


306
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.529
- A what?
- A Romero movie.


307
00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.829
You know, like, the holy trilogy:
Night, Dawn and Day.


308
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:49.129
They say he's going to make Twilight of
the Dead one day, but I doubt it.


309
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:52.029
Yeah, I find this
all a little hard to believe.


310
00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:54.229
It was a stunt.
It was part of the rave.


311
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.429
- It wasn't a stunt, Alicia.
- You know what?


312
00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.329
Simon says let's get out of here
and let the cops ask questions later...


313
00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.929
while we're kicking it back in Seattle
selling our story to the Enquirer.


314
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.229
Sounds great.
You got a boat?


315
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:07.429
- Yes, down at the beach.
- Thank God.


316
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.929
Then let's not waste any more time
yakking. Let's just go!


317
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:13.229
We can't. We still have friends back at
the rave. We're not going to leave them.


318
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.729
We got to get out of here
while we still can.


319
00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.129
We're not leaving without them.

320
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.430
Okay. Let's go.

321
00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:00.330
- So, you came with that girl?
- What?


322
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:04.110
Let me give you a tip. I don't think
she's a natural red, white and blue.


323
00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:09.729
Met her at the rave.
So, who's your boy over there...


324
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:13.029
with the Tom Cruise smile
and the Rain Man brain?


325
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:17.729
He just so happens to be the biggest
underwear model in America.


326
00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:19.629
Congratulations.

327
00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:22.529
- That's great.
- You okay, Simon?


328
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.630
Sure.

329
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.229
Where the hell are they?

330
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:43.629
- Greg? Cindy?
- Please, do not do that.


331
00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:45.329
You're being taken, Hugh.

332
00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:47.929
This is all just one big practical joke.

333
00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:50.529
If you'd been here, which you weren't,
you wouldn't think it was a joke.


334
00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.730
Believe me.

335
00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:54.430
What is that?

336
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:57.129
I am so not touching that.

337
00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.730
Hold this.

338
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.430
Let's flip it over.

339
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:10.430
Liberty.

340
00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:25.029
Holy... Dude, what the fuck
happened to you?


341
00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.029
I was in there,
and then all of the sudden...


342
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.729
the fricking... the banging,
and then the fricking thing fell over.


343
00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.630
And I was stuck inside. Shit!

344
00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.430
- You're in deep shit, huh?
- That's very funny.


345
00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.530
Get that fucking...
Who are you?


346
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:46.630
- Where's Cyn?
- I don't know, bro. You tell me.


347
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:50.130
We got to go find her.

348
00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:10.129
Where the fuck did that come from?

349
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.530
What is... Oh, my God!

350
00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.530
What is... Cynthia!

351
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:23.929
What the hell was that thing?

352
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:25.829
Our best friend.

353
00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:28.129
Not anymore.

354
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.229
She was like a wild animal.

355
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:33.129
Did you see her face?
Oh, my God!


356
00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:36.629
- It's horrible!
- What happened to her?


357
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:38.629
Everybody hold on a minute.

358
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:41.229
Maybe I can get us some answers.

359
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.530
McGyvers, come in.

360
00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:48.429
This is Casper.
Come in. Over. It's out.


361
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:52.029
I am not getting anything on the radio.
Anyone have a cell phone?


362
00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:54.029
We already tried. 
It's not working.

363
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:57.329
- There's some sort of interference.
- Look, I don't know what's going on.


364
00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:00.029
What I do know is I have got to
get you all off this island.


365
00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.329
- How did you get here?
- On a boat like everyone else.


366
00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:04.929
But it's gone.
It's been destroyed.


367
00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.329
We didn't. We came
in the Lazarus with Kirk.


368
00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.629
- Where is he?
- He's in the inlet down at the beach.


369
00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.929
- Can you take me to him?
- Are you going to arrest him?


370
00:34:11.930 --> 00:34:13.929
Not at the moment.
Right now...


371
00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:16.629
I just want to get you all
as far away from here as possible.


372
00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.630
Sounds like a plan to me.

373
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:52.129
I am so fucking scared, Simon.

374
00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:55.030
I know. Me too.

375
00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:01.230
I just can't believe Cynthia's dead.

376
00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.130
I am so sorry, Alicia.

377
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:13.030
Quiet, everybody.

378
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.730
Everyone, quiet.

379
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:17.630
Shit!

380
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.029
Can we go home now, please?

381
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:37.629
Let's get out of here!
Come on!


382
00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.430
- Move it!
- Let's go!


383
00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:52.130
Go!

384
00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.330
- Oh, shit!
- Kirk!


385
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:08.929
It's got to be down here!
It's got to be down here!


386
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.130
- All right.
- Where is it?


387
00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:19.929
- Oh, God, that's not Kirk.
- Simon!


388
00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:22.029
- Don't jump in the water!
- Simon, don't!


389
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:25.730
- No, don't!
- Simon, don't go!


390
00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:47.230
- Swim, Simon!
- Swim!


391
00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:52.929
- Look out!
- Go, go, go!


392
00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.430
Get out of the water, Simon!

393
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:38.129
Shoot him!

394
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:39.730
Rudy, behind you!

395
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.029
Swim, Simon! Swim!

396
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:47.830
No! Liberty!

397
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:21.729
Shoot it!

398
00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:24.830
What do you think I am trying
to do, you fucking moron?


399
00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.330
Come on.
Come on.


400
00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:59.529
Fuck! You fucking zombie bastards!

401
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:02.729
You're not going to fuck with us again,
are you, asshole?


402
00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.130
Are you? Are you?

403
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:15.329
- My face!
- You all right? Let me see.


404
00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.729
Let me see.
Could I have your coat?


405
00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:21.129
- Oh, fuck!
- Here, let me see it. Let me look.


406
00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.929
Fuck!

407
00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.029
- Let me see it.
- Are you a doctor?


408
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:28.729
- Hardly. He's premed.
- I am in med school.


409
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:31.730
At least you're not pre-law.

410
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:35.730
- Oh, my God.
- Let me see.


411
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.529
- Is that a bite?
- Yeah.


412
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.029
- All right.
- Hmm?


413
00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:46.429
I have got to get back to the patrol boat.
I can get on the radio and get us help.


414
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:50.129
Wait. Are you just going to leave us here
while you go looking for the cavalry?


415
00:41:50.130 --> 00:41:52.929
- You're coming with me.
- Me? Why me?


416
00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:55.729
Are you a doctor?
Are you wounded?


417
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:58.229
- Can you use a gun?
- Well, I can...


418
00:41:58.230 --> 00:42:00.229
That's why you.

419
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:02.229
The boat should be
a mile or so up the beach.


420
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.229
We will climb aboard and come back
for help. Understood?


421
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:07.129
- Come on.
- Greg. My name's Greg.


422
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:09.130
Come on, Greg!

423
00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:17.229
- Hey, what the hell were those things?
- I don't know.


424
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:21.629
But what I do know now is why
they call this island Isle del Morte.


425
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.629
You got to do this.
You got to do this.


426
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.630
There must be some kind
of scientific explanation for this.


427
00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:32.329
Liberty's right.
They got to be some kind of mutation.


428
00:42:32.330 --> 00:42:36.929
Yeah, from what? The shrinking ozone?
What, too little sunscreen?


429
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:39.729
Rudy, give me a break.
These are zombies pure and simple.


430
00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:42.229
The sooner we accept it
and deal with it...


431
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.630
the better chance we have
of getting out of here alive.


432
00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:50.829
Your first mate seemed to know something
about this island. What was it?


433
00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:54.530
- Nothing but an old wives' tale.
- Like the walking dead?


434
00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:57.730
Well...

435
00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:01.730
best I reckon, the story goes...

436
00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:06.629
there was once some
crazy Spanish padre...


437
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.629
who was banished from Spain...

438
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.129
hundreds of years ago.

439
00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:13.830
His name was Castillo Sermano.

440
00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.930
You asked to see me,
Father Castillo?


441
00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:43.130
Come closer, Captain.
I cannot see your face.


442
00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.130
Are you afraid, Captain?

443
00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:55.429
You know why
I was banished from Spain?


444
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:58.629
Your experiments are not of God.

445
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:59.630
God?

446
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:04.929
What has God done for you,
or for me?


447
00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:07.229
Nothing.

448
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:11.729
There is no God.
There's only me.


449
00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:15.030
May he have mercy on your soul.

450
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:29.029
The Spanish were trying from falling...

451
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.729
the sands into the limeys.

452
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:34.430
They never made it to the garrison.

453
00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:39.329
They say he murdered the crew
of the St. Cristobol...


454
00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:44.829
enslaved the natives of this island,
and killed whoever came here ever since.


455
00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.529
Some say he still does.

456
00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.929
- I am sorry I asked.
- If you ask me...


457
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:53.229
it's just a bunch
of smugglers and cutthroats...


458
00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.229
looking for ways
to scare people off.


459
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.729
Well, you would know,
wouldn't you?


460
00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:59.829
What can I say?

461
00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:03.130
They're doing a hell of a job,
ain't they?


462
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:18.229
What is it?

463
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:21.830
- I can't hear anything.
- Neither do I.


464
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:30.430
Run! Run!

465
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:49.829
We can't stay out here like this.
We're too vulnerable.


466
00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:51.829
I know, but we can't leave
until Greg and Casper get back.


467
00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:54.929
We got to get back on that boat, but
there's no way I am going in that water.


468
00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:58.329
We can't. It's too far. Besides,
we don't know what's still on that boat.


469
00:47:58.330 --> 00:48:00.430
What about that house?

470
00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:03.929
It's defensible.
We will have shelter.


471
00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:07.429
Okay, it's a good idea. We make a run
for it as soon as they get back.


472
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:09.429
What if they don't come back?
What then?


473
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:11.729
- They will come back.
- Yeah, but what if they don't?


474
00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:14.729
What are we going to do?
We don't have any weapons or food.


475
00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:17.430
- I mean, we don't have shit.
- Actually, we do.


476
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:33.029
- You got to be kidding me.
- This is why Casper's on your ass?


477
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:35.929
- You're smuggling Cuban cigars?
- Among other things.


478
00:48:35.930 --> 00:48:38.929
Still hard at work smuggling,
I see, Victor.


479
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.329
Don't you just wish
you could prove that, Jordan?


480
00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:44.529
- What are these then?
- We just found them on the beach.


481
00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:46.329
- Right.
- Crazy, huh?


482
00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:48.829
I am not going to worry about that
right now. We have got bigger problems.


483
00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:51.529
My patrol boat's been destroyed.
My first mate is missing.


484
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:54.530
- What about Greg? Where is he?
- Yeah.


485
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:56.829
I don't think he made it.

486
00:48:56.830 --> 00:49:00.329
- What do you mean?
- He's gone. I am sorry.


487
00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:03.829
We got to go back there and look for him.
Maybe there's a chance he's okay.


488
00:49:03.830 --> 00:49:07.129
- We can't just leave him out there.
- He's dead.


489
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:10.930
If you don't want to end up like him,
shut up and listen to what she's saying.


490
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:15.330
What else you got in there
besides smokes? Anything useful?


491
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:19.930
Let me introduce you
to my little friend.


492
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:31.929
And who said size doesn't matter?

493
00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:35.029
Nice. But mine's bigger.

494
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:36.929
Mossberg 500.

495
00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:40.629
Stainless shotgun
with incendiary shells.


496
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:42.830
Saving the best for last.

497
00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:48.030
Here you go.
Take it.


498
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.729
Good choice.

499
00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:58.029
Desert Eagle.
I like the way you think, girl.


500
00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:01.729
We can't stay here for long.
Those creatures are everywhere.


501
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:04.329
We talked about making a run for it
to that house that we found.


502
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:07.129
That sounds like a good idea. We can
hole up in there until help arrives.


503
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:08.629
If help arrives.

504
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:12.429
Don't worry. When we don't report in,
the marine patrol will come for us.


505
00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:15.130
Everyone know how
to use their weapons?


506
00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:58.829
- Shit!
- We're going to have to make a run for it.


507
00:50:58.830 --> 00:51:00.829
- What if they're already inside?
- That's a chance we have to take.


508
00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:03.329
We can hold up a lot better
in there than we can out here.


509
00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:05.230
- Once they spot us...
- Oh, God!


510
00:53:17.530 --> 00:53:19.730
Over here!

511
00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:51.229
- The door's locked!
- You got to be kidding me!


512
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:55.330
We could blow the door. But there
won't be enough left to keep them out.


513
00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.930
Forget it.
We will find another way.


514
00:58:47.530 --> 00:58:51.129
- We need more ammo!
- We haven't got any.


515
00:58:51.130 --> 00:58:53.329
- I am down to my last clip.
- Yeah, me too.


516
00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:55.329
I am saving mine for myself.

517
00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:57.730
Are you okay?
Watch out!


518
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:07.330
- The window!
- Can you get through, Rudy?


519
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:12.030
Yeah. Come on!

520
00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:14.930
Oh, shit.

521
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:18.630
Die, you son of a bitch!

522
00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:25.330
Pull! Hurry!

523
00:59:41.230 --> 00:59:43.630
Oh, my God!

524
00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:47.930
Oh, my God!

525
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:50.929
Casper? Look at me.

526
00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:53.429
Casper, look at me.
I need you to look at me.


527
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:56.029
Okay? Look at me.

528
00:59:56.030 --> 01:00:00.029
Look at me.
You saved us, okay?


529
01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:02.130
You saved us.

530
01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:09.030
Shit, I am out!

531
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:26.830
Fuck.

532
01:01:00.930 --> 01:01:03.430
Let's get him to that table!

533
01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:08.530
See if we can find something
to use as a bandage.


534
01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:12.630
Simon, we should check
for more of them.


535
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:20.529
- Sorry.
- Where's Casper, Rudy?


536
01:01:20.530 --> 01:01:23.030
She didn't make it.
I am sorry.


537
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:29.230
Okay.

538
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:39.529
Okay, Captain, this is going to hurt.

539
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:42.329
Do it. Do it!

540
01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:44.630
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.


541
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:53.830
- Give me a light.
- Here.


542
01:01:57.630 --> 01:02:00.930
Fuck. Oh, shit.

543
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:05.830
Don't look at me.

544
01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:14.830
I am the fucking Elephant Man.

545
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:22.729
- I think we should...
- Just get away from me.


546
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:25.130
I don't need your help.

547
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:42.129
- Hang in there, Kirk.
- All right, all right, all right.


548
01:02:42.130 --> 01:02:45.330
Just get some rest.

549
01:02:47.130 --> 01:02:50.830
- Is he going to end up like Cynthia?
- I don't know.


550
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:13.729
What do you think's
going to happen to us?


551
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:17.430
- Does it matter?
- It does. It matters to me.


552
01:03:18.830 --> 01:03:21.429
I mean, are we even
going to get out of here?


553
01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:24.629
Even if we get out of here,
I am finished.


554
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:28.329
Who's going to be able to look me
in the eyes with a face like this?


555
01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:29.929
I am a freak.
I belong in the fucking circus.


556
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:32.329
Don't talk like that.

557
01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:35.729
I happen to think
you have been very brave tonight.


558
01:03:35.730 --> 01:03:38.930
And I still think
you're pretty damn sexy.


559
01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:50.429
You're not just doing this
to make me feel better, are you?


560
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:53.630
I am doing this
to make me feel better.


561
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:06.529
It's so quiet.

562
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:08.529
Yeah, it's almost too quiet.

563
01:04:08.530 --> 01:04:11.630
- Look at this.
- What?


564
01:04:13.530 --> 01:04:16.129
Where are they dragging them?

565
01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:18.129
What are they doing
with the bodies?


566
01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:20.430
I got a bad feeling.

567
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.029
What happened?

568
01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:32.729
- Rudy, what happened?
- Why does it matter what happened?


569
01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:36.329
She's dead. I didn't save her.

570
01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:38.429
- It's not your fault.
- It was my fault!


571
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:40.729
It was my fault!

572
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:43.529
Were you here?
Did you see it?


573
01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:46.230
Did you see...
watch them rip her apart?


574
01:04:52.530 --> 01:04:54.530
You know what?

575
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:58.030
You know what?

576
01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:11.930
It's not going to happen again.

577
01:05:13.330 --> 01:05:15.330
We're going to get out of here.

578
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:26.030
It's Kirk. You need to take a look
at him. He's getting worse.


579
01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:29.030
Okay.

580
01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:40.329
How you doing, Captain?

581
01:05:40.330 --> 01:05:43.730
- I wouldn't mind a drink.
- Okay.


582
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:49.629
That's all we got.

583
01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:54.930
Not exactly what I had in mind,
but thanks just the same.


584
01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:01.630
Guys, check out this book.

585
01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:06.430
It looks pretty old.
Maybe it will help us.


586
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:13.530
Well, that cuts it.
I am either going to get better or I ain't.


587
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:22.129
In any case, you have no agua, a fistful
of ammo left and zero rations.


588
01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:25.629
Maybe it's time
you stopped babysitting me...


589
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:28.429
and started worrying about yourselves
a bit more.


590
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:32.129
- What'd you have in mind?
- Check out the rest of the house.


591
01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:36.229
See what you can scrounge and
where you can fortify yourselves better.


592
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:39.730
There's no telling
what's coming through that door next.


593
01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:43.830
Maybe there's another way out of here.

594
01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:47.129
You guys,
this looks like a ship's journal.


595
01:06:47.130 --> 01:06:51.629
According to the officer's logs, it says
Castillo Sermano killed the captain...


596
01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:54.229
then beached the ship
and lit it on fire.


597
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:57.029
So the stories that Kirk told us
make sense now.


598
01:06:57.030 --> 01:06:59.330
You'd better go now. Go.

599
01:07:00.330 --> 01:07:02.030
You're right.

600
01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:06.029
- You going to be okay?
- Just fine.


601
01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:09.530
If not, I have always got this.

602
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:16.330
The captain's right. We got to get out of
here and search the rest of this house.


603
01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:24.130
Let's go.

604
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:33.030
Let's start with the courtyard.

605
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:48.430
What is all this?

606
01:07:52.330 --> 01:07:55.529
What's in there?

607
01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.730
- I can't...
- It's locked?


608
01:08:06.030 --> 01:08:09.630
- What...
- Oh, my God.


609
01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:14.130
This is sick!

610
01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:26.830
Sorry.
This is unbelievable.


611
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:31.930
- Why aren't these zombies alive?
- I don't know.


612
01:09:05.230 --> 01:09:07.730
Rudy, take a look at this.

613
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:17.529
It's blood.

614
01:09:17.530 --> 01:09:19.330
It's blood?

615
01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:22.729
Yeah, but...

616
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:24.729
it's not human, though.

617
01:09:24.730 --> 01:09:27.430
It's like it's...
It's like it's been mutated.


618
01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:31.530
I have never seen anything
like it before.


619
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:34.630
It's completely unnatural.

620
01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:38.230
It's fucking genius.

621
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:05.830
I am not going to let Salish
live like one of them.


622
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:12.130
Kirk, where are you?

623
01:11:27.930 --> 01:11:31.029
What are you doing?
They're going to kill you.


624
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:33.230
I am dead already.

625
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:44.129
See you in hell, boys.

626
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:46.830
Everybody get down! Now!

627
01:11:55.330 --> 01:11:56.830
Get out of here! Everybody!

628
01:11:59.530 --> 01:12:03.429
- We just need to...
- Lock the door!


629
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:05.130
Hurry, hurry!

630
01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:09.180
What?

631
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:16.629
- What is that?
- Son of a bitch! It's gunpowder.


632
01:12:16.630 --> 01:12:19.929
Well, it's a good thing.
We can use it, right?


633
01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:22.529
The only way we can use it
is if we blew it up, and...


634
01:12:22.530 --> 01:12:25.729
No, it's useless, because
someone would have to be here to...


635
01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:28.229
I will go to the lab.
I am going to see if I can find something.


636
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:30.729
I will go with you.

637
01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:32.830
Let's see.

638
01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:40.030
What is this?

639
01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:48.530
What happened?

640
01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:51.430
Karma, no!

641
01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:57.030
Oh, my God, it's the blood!
It brings them back to life!


642
01:13:02.230 --> 01:13:03.230
Go!

643
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:07.430
Here!

644
01:13:10.330 --> 01:13:12.129
Here, use this!

645
01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:14.330
- Let's move this!
- Board it up with this!


646
01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:19.030
They're breaking through!

647
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:21.730
Come on!

648
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:26.029
You guys, there's a door!

649
01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:28.329
Get down! Go!

650
01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:31.030
Simon, come on!

651
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:37.330
Just go!

652
01:13:39.730 --> 01:13:41.730
Shit!

653
01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:36.029
Where the hell are we?

654
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:38.630
Must be some kind of catacomb
underneath the house.


655
01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:42.530
Sorry, Karma.

656
01:14:44.430 --> 01:14:47.629
This must be how they shift supplies
from the ship to the house.


657
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:51.830
If that's the case, then one of these
tunnels lead to the beach somewhere.


658
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:54.430
Let's go.

659
01:15:14.330 --> 01:15:16.030
I am out.

660
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:36.029
- Have they gone?
- I hope so.


661
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:37.930
Listen. Be quiet.

662
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:44.730
Let's go.

663
01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:55.330
- Go! Go!
- Go, go, go, go!


664
01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:04.830
- I will take care of these guys.
- Karma, no!


665
01:16:12.630 --> 01:16:14.229
Get out of here! Hurry!

666
01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:15.830
Hurry!

667
01:17:00.930 --> 01:17:03.930
- Greg, what are you doing here?
- What is this room?


668
01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:10.030
Greg, we thought you were dead.

669
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:18.730
Greg, say something.

670
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:28.530
Alicia, get away from him.
That's not Greg! Get away!


671
01:17:30.930 --> 01:17:32.929
Get off me!

672
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:35.429
- Oh, God!
- What do they want with us?


673
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:38.330
On the table.
On the table!


674
01:17:39.630 --> 01:17:42.130
Hold him down.
Hold him down!


675
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:49.229
Your body parts...

676
01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:52.629
they will serve me well
for a long time.


677
01:17:52.630 --> 01:17:54.129
Beautiful.

678
01:17:54.130 --> 01:17:58.629
The blood we found,
it ties all the creatures.


679
01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:02.130
You created it all so
you could be immortal. Why?


680
01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:06.729
To live forever.

681
01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:09.229
It works.

682
01:18:09.230 --> 01:18:11.429
After all these years, it finally works.

683
01:18:11.430 --> 01:18:15.029
The blood lives like I said it would.

684
01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:17.629
Fantastic.

685
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:20.229
Did you hear what I said?

686
01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:22.229
It works.

687
01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:24.529
I am going to live forever.

688
01:18:24.530 --> 01:18:26.230
Forever.

689
01:18:34.830 --> 01:18:37.529
I will never die.

690
01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:40.629
You think you can kill me?

691
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:42.930
I will live forever.

692
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.530
Forever!

693
01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:11.829
Your skin.

694
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:14.330
So beautiful.

695
01:19:18.430 --> 01:19:20.729
I have been waiting for you...

696
01:19:20.730 --> 01:19:22.830
for a long time.

697
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:27.029
What do you want?

698
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:31.330
I just want your flesh.

699
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:51.130
Run! Come on!

700
01:20:14.330 --> 01:20:16.930
- Fuck, that was close!
- I can't believe what just happened!


701
01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:22.929
Isn't it nice to know
someone wants you for your body?


702
01:20:22.930 --> 01:20:24.329
Yeah.

703
01:20:24.330 --> 01:20:26.830
Depending on what they want.

704
01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:35.230
We got to get to the beach.
Come on.


705
01:21:11.330 --> 01:21:13.030
Fucker!

706
01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:20.230
Fuck you!

707
01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:47.130
Game over, fucker.

708
01:22:57.730 --> 01:22:59.330
Oh, my God.

709
01:24:09.030 --> 01:24:11.729
Maintain perimeter.
"G" and I are proceeding inside.


710
01:24:11.730 --> 01:24:15.630
Advise of any contact with reanimated
Homo sapiens. Maintain alpha alert.


711
01:24:20.230 --> 01:24:23.129
- Who are you?
- Who are you?


712
01:24:23.130 --> 01:24:26.629
We're here to rescue you.

713
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:29.529
- Thanks.
- Is she okay?


714
01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:32.030
Does she look okay?

715
01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:38.930
What's your name?

716
01:24:39.930 --> 01:24:41.829
Rudolph.

717
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:43.930
You got a last name?

718
01:24:45.930 --> 01:24:47.530
Curien.

719
01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:53.129
I feel guilty
because of what happened.


720
01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:55.129
It was a nightmare.

721
01:24:55.130 --> 01:24:58.529
So many dead, so many victims...

722
01:24:58.530 --> 01:25:01.129
and people that were my friends.

723
01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:04.229
And now we go home...
me and Alicia.


724
01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:08.129
Or whatever she is now,
whatever I have created.


725
01:25:08.130 --> 01:25:10.729
God, ain't love a bitch?

726
01:25:10.730 --> 01:25:14.630
Is this the end,
or only the beginning?


727
01:30:02.930 --> 01:30:06.230
The House of the Dead.
