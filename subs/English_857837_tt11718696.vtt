00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:44.231
Welcome to politics today.

5
00:00:45.698 --> 00:00:47.535
We're speaking with professor
Gerald loss Sinclair fellow of


6
00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:50.304
political science at Eldridge
university.


7
00:00:50.337 --> 00:00:54.208
Professor loss is America
becoming a fascist state?


8
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:57.144
[dramatic music]

9
00:01:01.614 --> 00:01:04.617
Well frankly I think it's
preposterous


10
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:08.055
the idea that the United States
could somehow become


11
00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:08.988
a dictatorship.

12
00:01:10.257 --> 00:01:12.059
It's a science fiction.

13
00:01:12.093 --> 00:01:17.264
[dramatic music]

14
00:01:17.298 --> 00:01:20.234
Don't get me wrong I'm not
saying that fascism is fiction


15
00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:23.471
or that fascism doesn't flourish
all over the world


16
00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:25.638
but this is America.

17
00:01:25.672 --> 00:01:28.908
[dramatic music]

18
00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:36.883
We have a system of checks and
balances designed to prevent


19
00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:39.487
any one branch of government
from exercising


20
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.188
an inordinate amount of power.

21
00:01:41.222 --> 00:01:44.225
[dramatic music]

22
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.432
Believe me this too will pass.
America will never be governed


23
00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:52.333
by a dictator

24
00:01:52.366 --> 00:01:54.368
or demagogue or a king.

25
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:57.404
[dramatic music]

26
00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.045
The America of today is not the
Germany of the 1930's.


27
00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.182
The average American is not
going to buy into a philosophy


28
00:02:08.215 --> 00:02:09.083
of hatred.

29
00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:12.119
[dramatic music]

30
00:02:15.356 --> 00:02:19.226
We are a nation of immigrants.
How is anyone going to convince


31
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.195
us to hate ourselves.

32
00:02:21.228 --> 00:02:24.131
[dramatic music]

33
00:02:25.798 --> 00:02:27.334
Our democracy is resilient.

34
00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:29.336
We will come through this

35
00:02:30.538 --> 00:02:33.374
and without the civil war some
people are talking about.


36
00:02:33.407 --> 00:02:36.410
[dramatic music]

37
00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:43.184
Look I understand people are
scared


38
00:02:43.217 --> 00:02:46.086
but I can assure you there's
absolutely nothing to


39
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.121
worry about.

40
00:02:47.154 --> 00:02:48.322
Believe me.

41
00:02:48.355 --> 00:02:51.258
It's all Much Ado About Nothing.

42
00:02:51.292 --> 00:02:53.594

44
00:02:58.965 --> 00:03:02.670
First up one great American news
we have field correspondent


45
00:03:02.702 --> 00:03:04.505
Malecki reporting

46
00:03:04.538 --> 00:03:05.772
from the capitol building.

47
00:03:06.906 --> 00:03:09.210
Well Charles as you can see
immigrants, minorities,


48
00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:13.314
socialists and other dissidents
are once again protesting in


49
00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:17.117
the streets. These traders
are making it abundantly


50
00:03:17.151 --> 00:03:19.486
clear that they
have one objective.


51
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.121
To destroy America.

52
00:03:21.155 --> 00:03:22.356
Enough.

53
00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:23.324
Mom!

54
00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:24.791
Off.

55
00:03:24.824 --> 00:03:26.793
Don't you want me to be
informed?


56
00:03:26.826 --> 00:03:29.862
The world is going to hell
in a hand basket.


57
00:03:29.896 --> 00:03:31.532
There you're informed.

58
00:03:31.565 --> 00:03:32.999
That's censorship.

59
00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:35.768
Yes it is. Now come on honey,
you gotta go do your homework.


60
00:03:57.024 --> 00:03:58.492
Hail the conquering hero.

61
00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:00.728
You won.

62
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.031
Maria Rodriguez is on a
path to citizenship.


63
00:04:04.064 --> 00:04:06.200
Score one for the good guys.

64
00:04:07.334 --> 00:04:09.036
How was school?

65
00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.072
The board is trying to ban
"1984."


66
00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:14.774
Oh yeah?

67
00:04:15.775 --> 00:04:17.810
Actually it's pretty ironic if
you think about.


68
00:04:17.844 --> 00:04:20.347
It's scary is what it is.

69
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:23.150
Do you think your law firm could
get involved?


70
00:04:23.183 --> 00:04:25.719
We do civil rights not
censorship.


71
00:04:25.753 --> 00:04:27.254
I know but

72
00:04:27.288 --> 00:04:30.024
aren't the students civil rights
being violated somehow I mean


73
00:04:30.057 --> 00:04:33.694
they have a right to a complete
education don't they.


74
00:04:33.727 --> 00:04:34.861
They do.

75
00:04:34.894 --> 00:04:38.032
A lawsuit won't do it?

76
00:04:38.065 --> 00:04:39.832
No.

77
00:04:39.866 --> 00:04:41.702
Oh, it was worth a shot.

78
00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:42.969
Don't forget,

79
00:04:43.002 --> 00:04:44.538
we got the Dem club meeting
tonight.


80
00:04:46.373 --> 00:04:47.341
Right.

81
00:04:48.808 --> 00:04:50.009
Right.

82
00:04:56.717 --> 00:04:58.252
Hey kiddo.

83
00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.722
Mom wouldn't let me watch the
news.


84
00:05:01.755 --> 00:05:03.324
That's censorship.

85
00:05:03.357 --> 00:05:05.359
That's what I said.

86
00:05:07.994 --> 00:05:09.663
You took these with your cell
phone?


87
00:05:09.697 --> 00:05:11.231
Yep.

88
00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:16.737
You have a good eye.

89
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.072
I know.

90
00:05:18.105 --> 00:05:19.406
You also know that when you
use a printer you don't


91
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.141
have to let them dry right?

92
00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:24.311
Yeah but that's how they
do it in all the movies.


93
00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:25.546
Okay.

94
00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:28.282
The babysitter is gonna be here
soon. Your mom and I will be


95
00:05:28.315 --> 00:05:29.149
back in a few hours.

96
00:05:29.916 --> 00:05:31.552
What's the democratic club?

97
00:05:31.585 --> 00:05:34.388
It's a place where lonely
leftists rehash the same


98
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:37.491
arguments they've been having
for years.


99
00:05:37.524 --> 00:05:38.759
So why are you still going?

100
00:05:38.792 --> 00:05:41.161
Because your mom needs to feel
like she still the activist she


101
00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:42.496
used to be.

102
00:05:43.831 --> 00:05:45.499
She's standing right behind me
isn't she?


103
00:05:57.578 --> 00:05:59.213
I can't believe you said that!

104
00:05:59.246 --> 00:06:00.080
What?

105
00:06:00.114 --> 00:06:02.216
The activist she used to be.

106
00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:03.417
Come on.

107
00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.786
You do more for social justice
in one class then Dem club


108
00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.788
has in the last ten years.

109
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:10.524
You make it sound like a coffee
klatch.


110
00:06:10.557 --> 00:06:14.261
Okay before we get started let
me remind everyone that


111
00:06:14.294 --> 00:06:16.864
the coffee is on the back table
next to the minutes from last


112
00:06:16.896 --> 00:06:18.232
month's meeting.

113
00:06:18.265 --> 00:06:19.299
[gavel banging]

114
00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:21.468
The September meeting of
democratic club is now in


115
00:06:21.502 --> 00:06:25.672
session and the first item on
the agenda is going to be


116
00:06:25.706 --> 00:06:28.742
the Christmas fundraiser.

117
00:06:28.776 --> 00:06:31.145
I understand that we have some
options here.


118
00:06:31.178 --> 00:06:34.013
You're not serious with
everything that's going on


119
00:06:34.047 --> 00:06:35.915
you want to talk
about a fundraiser?


120
00:06:35.948 --> 00:06:38.218
We have a
process Max. You know that.


121
00:06:38.252 --> 00:06:41.555
Max what would you
like to talk about?


122
00:06:41.588 --> 00:06:42.523
Where to begin?

123
00:06:43.724 --> 00:06:47.161
The suppression of the free
press. State sanctioned hate


124
00:06:47.194 --> 00:06:50.431
crimes mass deportations. I've
even heard


125
00:06:50.464 --> 00:06:53.667
that the government is building
detention camps...


126
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.635
Have you heard that?

127
00:06:54.668 --> 00:06:56.403
Okay okay okay.

128
00:06:56.437 --> 00:06:59.373
Let's start with the camps.
There has been questionable


129
00:06:59.406 --> 00:07:03.043
construction going on in most
states.


130
00:07:03.076 --> 00:07:07.281
Also that the government has
been making lists.


131
00:07:07.314 --> 00:07:10.451
Exactly what kind of lists are
we talking about?


132
00:07:10.484 --> 00:07:12.920
I'm chief of staff for senator
Quick and I...


133
00:07:12.952 --> 00:07:16.123
Would that be state senator
Quick?


134
00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:22.930
The point is if the government
were compiling lists I think


135
00:07:22.962 --> 00:07:24.097
I'd know about it.

136
00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:26.934
I don't know what to tell you
David.


137
00:07:26.966 --> 00:07:29.436
Who's that?

138
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.437
[gavel pounding]

139
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:32.306
The information we have is that
government is...


140
00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:33.474
Definitely a government spy.

141
00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:35.476
Is listing names of...

142
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.481
progressive academics,
journalists, activists...


143
00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:44.016
May I say something?

144
00:07:45.285 --> 00:07:48.789
I was a professor of European
history for forty years.


145
00:07:48.822 --> 00:07:50.357
We all know who we are Max.

146
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.393
I'm simply establishing the
fact that I'm qualified to


147
00:07:53.427 --> 00:07:57.364
speak with authority on
the subject at hand.


148
00:07:57.397 --> 00:07:59.566
That guy's really starting to
creep me out.


149
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.204
It's not new the government
is normalizing fascism.


150
00:08:04.238 --> 00:08:07.140
Just going a little further
further each time.


151
00:08:07.174 --> 00:08:10.344
The national socialists did the
same thing.


152
00:08:10.377 --> 00:08:12.379
Hitler didn't start with
Auschwitz.


153
00:08:12.412 --> 00:08:14.181
He started by
demonizing immigrants.


154
00:08:14.214 --> 00:08:18.385
Harassing dissidents and
controlling the press.


155
00:08:18.418 --> 00:08:19.753
Does any of that sound familiar?

156
00:08:20.888 --> 00:08:23.624
If you'll permit me to read to
key article of


157
00:08:23.657 --> 00:08:25.726
our constitution. I think...

158
00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:28.028
Max, I don't think we have time.

159
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:29.396
Oh my god!

160
00:08:30.364 --> 00:08:32.366
There's been a bomb in the
capitol building.


161
00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:34.501
What?
[cell phones ringing]


162
00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:37.070
They're claiming it was the
protesters.


163
00:08:37.104 --> 00:08:39.873
It's the Reichstag fire all
over again.


164
00:08:39.907 --> 00:08:41.975
You think the government did
this?


165
00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:43.577
What better excuse
to crack down on dissidents?


166
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.213
Just because there's a motive
doesn't mean...


167
00:08:46.246 --> 00:08:48.715
How are protesters going to
get into the capitol building at


168
00:08:48.749 --> 00:08:49.883
ten o'clock at night?

169
00:08:49.917 --> 00:08:52.319
We are not talking about a plane
or a van.


170
00:08:52.352 --> 00:08:55.155
Somebody had to have security
clearance.


171
00:08:57.758 --> 00:09:00.594
Due to the latest incident I
think we should


172
00:09:00.627 --> 00:09:01.929
call it a night.

173
00:09:01.962 --> 00:09:03.031
I move to adjourn.

174
00:09:03.063 --> 00:09:05.132
Second.

175
00:09:05.165 --> 00:09:06.867
The meeting is adjourned

176
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.504
and I suggest that you all stay
home tonight until we find out


177
00:09:10.537 --> 00:09:12.472
what the government's going to
do about this incident.


178
00:09:15.108 --> 00:09:17.311
What was that about?

on our hands.

What did you think about what
Max saying tonight?


185
00:09:41.234 --> 00:09:42.769
You're asking if I think the
government orchestrated the


186
00:09:42.803 --> 00:09:45.973
bombing as an excuse to
crackdown on dissidents?


187
00:09:46.006 --> 00:09:47.441
It's a Brave New World.

188
00:09:47.474 --> 00:09:51.244
Sure, you know Max he's always
been paranoid.

What the hell?

191
00:09:53.814 --> 00:09:56.650
You are under arrest by order of
the United States government.

I wanna see warrant.

194
00:09:59.386 --> 00:10:01.488

of it as a game.

Yeah.

206
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.605
I'm here to David Gretsch.

Dabiri? You're new at the club.

211
00:11:02.482 --> 00:11:04.217
I've only been to a few
meetings.


212
00:11:04.251 --> 00:11:05.886
How come we haven't
said anything?


213
00:11:05.919 --> 00:11:07.754
I haven't had anything to say.

214
00:11:07.788 --> 00:11:08.955
This isn't a coincidence.

215
00:11:08.989 --> 00:11:10.223
No.

216
00:11:10.257 --> 00:11:12.926
They must be using the Dem
club's membership list.


217
00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:13.960
Okay,

218
00:11:13.994 --> 00:11:15.996
but who are they?

219
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.998
Where do you think they're
taking us?


220
00:11:18.032 --> 00:11:19.800
Maybe some kind of
detention camp?


221
00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:21.102
Let's hope so.

This is how they do it.

00:12:03.643 --> 00:12:05.645
Anybody with a dissenting
voice...


227
00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:08.949
They round you up. Take you
to the forest and make you dig


228
00:12:08.982 --> 00:12:09.883
your own grave

00:12:09.916 --> 00:12:10.951

going on?

another way how bout you just

Please! I'm gonna
tell you all I know.


248

Last night the government
started arresting dissidents.


249
00:13:11.845 --> 00:13:12.679
People who have been

250
00:13:12.712 --> 00:13:15.682
signing petitions or going to
rallies.


251
00:13:15.715 --> 00:13:18.018
Or belong to a democratic club?

252
00:13:18.052 --> 00:13:19.120
Exactly.

What you mean all
across the country?


254
00:13:20.554 --> 00:13:22.823
The president used the bombing
at the capitol building as


255
00:13:22.856 --> 00:13:26.860
an excuse to invoke the war
powers act. Five minutes later


256
00:13:26.893 --> 00:13:28.995
he declares martial law
and the military starts rounding


257
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.697
everybody up.

258
00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.466
Thanks to Martin we
knew it was coming.


259
00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.569
So you just kidnapped us?

260
00:13:35.602 --> 00:13:38.039
Would you rather be in a camp?

261
00:13:38.072 --> 00:13:39.706
No of course not but you can't

262
00:13:39.739 --> 00:13:43.211
keep us here wherever the hell
here is.


263
00:13:43.244 --> 00:13:44.511
Now listen, there's

264
00:13:44.544 --> 00:13:48.316
armed conflicts happening across
the entire country.


265
00:13:48.348 --> 00:13:49.583
You're a wanted man.

266
00:13:50.383 --> 00:13:51.751
You want to go? Go.

267
00:13:53.019 --> 00:13:54.988
In fact, Martin's heading back
to the fighting he'll take you


268
00:13:55.022 --> 00:13:56.290
with him, sure

269
00:13:56.324 --> 00:14:00.560
and all of you whoever wants to
leave, leave.

273
00:14:41.369 --> 00:14:43.137
It's...

274
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:44.105
definitely different.

275
00:14:49.409 --> 00:14:50.911
Is it safe?

276
00:14:50.944 --> 00:14:53.013
As long as they don't find out
we're here.


277
00:14:53.047 --> 00:14:54.115
Who owns it?

278
00:14:54.148 --> 00:14:56.850
Someone from the resistance.
Free America, they call


279
00:14:56.883 --> 00:14:59.019
themselves or I
guess I should say


280
00:14:59.053 --> 00:15:00.921
what we call ourselves.

281
00:15:00.954 --> 00:15:05.525
Free America? Smart
branding at least.


282
00:15:05.558 --> 00:15:06.960
Is there any electricity?

283
00:15:06.993 --> 00:15:10.097
Yeah, we have a generator in the
basement.


284
00:15:10.131 --> 00:15:11.831
Okay everyone.

285

five minutes.

I'll give you hand Sandy.

287

Now it really is a Dem club
meeting.


288
00:15:22.343 --> 00:15:24.211
How are you feeling?

289
00:15:24.245 --> 00:15:27.415
Oh, uh, much better thank you.

290
00:15:27.447 --> 00:15:30.051
Do you mind if I check your
pulse?


291
00:15:30.084 --> 00:15:31.319
You're a doctor?

292
00:15:31.352 --> 00:15:34.521
Neurosurgeon, although right now
I'd rather be a cardiologist.


293
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:43.164
Can I ask you a question?

294
00:15:43.197 --> 00:15:44.531
Shoot.

295
00:15:44.564 --> 00:15:46.233
How did you pull this off?

296
00:15:46.267 --> 00:15:48.169
You mean how did we get you all
out?


297
00:15:48.202 --> 00:15:50.704
Yeah that and this place.

298
00:15:50.737 --> 00:15:53.873
It was mostly Martin. Free
America was organizing on


299
00:15:53.907 --> 00:15:57.510
the dark web for months. A few
weeks ago Martin came to me and


300
00:15:57.544 --> 00:16:00.114
said that all of us
run arrest list


301
00:16:00.147 --> 00:16:02.949
and he was assigned to get us to
a safe house.


302
00:16:02.983 --> 00:16:06.120
Sounded crazy but...

303
00:16:06.153 --> 00:16:08.822
for some reason I believed him.

304
00:16:08.855 --> 00:16:10.991
Are there other safe houses?

305
00:16:11.025 --> 00:16:12.826
All over the country.

306
00:16:12.859 --> 00:16:15.595
Speaking of all over the
country, where exactly are we?


307
00:16:15.628 --> 00:16:17.597
I don't know.

308
00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:19.066
What does that mean?

309
00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.203
Well Sandy and I got here the
exactly the same way you did.


310
00:16:22.236 --> 00:16:23.570
The less we know the better.

311
00:16:23.603 --> 00:16:25.805
You mean if we're caught.

312
00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:27.874
Still you could give us some
warning.


313
00:16:27.907 --> 00:16:32.046
No I couldn't. The arrest
had to look legit.


314
00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:35.782
You know Martin risked
everything to bring us all here.


315
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.853
You doing OK bubba?

316
00:16:39.886 --> 00:16:41.155
I'm perplexed.

317
00:16:41.188 --> 00:16:43.190
Join the club kid.

318
00:16:45.625 --> 00:16:51.165
Listen, I'm going to explain
everything to you later okay.


319
00:16:51.198 --> 00:16:53.933
Want to go grab a couple cookies
from the kitchen?


320
00:16:53.967 --> 00:16:57.204
Hey no TV but I, uh, I
found a radio.


321
00:16:59.073 --> 00:17:02.675
Raids continued throughout the
night. Thousands of suspected


322
00:17:02.709 --> 00:17:05.578
terrorists have been taken into
custody prompting the military


323
00:17:05.612 --> 00:17:08.282
to declare Operation Patriot

324
00:17:08.315 --> 00:17:10.251
an unqualified success.

325
00:17:11.318 --> 00:17:12.086
So it's over?

326
00:17:13.521 --> 00:17:14.554
That's state media.

See if you can get a Canadian
station.


328
00:17:17.124 --> 00:17:20.127
How much of the military
is on our side?


329
00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:21.362
According to Martin, it's not

330
00:17:21.395 --> 00:17:25.632
just guerilla raids we're
talking full blown civil war.


331
00:17:25.665 --> 00:17:26.933
Here we go.

Here's more of Tom Davis
with updates from the U. S.


333
00:17:29.736 --> 00:17:32.806
Fierce fighting continues in all
major cities throughout


334
00:17:32.839 --> 00:17:35.775
the United States. Preliminary
reports suggest that


335
00:17:35.809 --> 00:17:38.145
casualties are already
in the thousands.


336
00:17:38.179 --> 00:17:39.146
Jesus.

337
00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.847
It seems that the Free
America forces are well


338
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.285
organized, well equipped and
prepared for a prolonged


339
00:17:44.318 --> 00:17:45.852
conflict.

[muffled conversation]

341
00:17:56.363 --> 00:17:58.365
How long can we stay here?

342
00:17:58.399 --> 00:18:00.633
As long as we need to.

343
00:18:00.667 --> 00:18:03.670
Or until the food runs out.

344
00:18:03.703 --> 00:18:05.872
Well that shouldn't be a
problem.


345
00:18:05.905 --> 00:18:09.943
Martin will be back in a month
to resupply.


346
00:18:09.976 --> 00:18:11.212
No the...

347
00:18:11.245 --> 00:18:14.381
only concern is that make sure
that nobody knows we're here.


348
00:18:14.415 --> 00:18:16.616
Anybody have a cell phone?

349
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.825
Good because one GPS signal

350
00:18:25.859 --> 00:18:27.328
and we're finished.

351
00:18:27.361 --> 00:18:28.962
I have a question.

352
00:18:28.995 --> 00:18:30.531
Okay.

353
00:18:30.564 --> 00:18:32.433
Who put you in charge?

354
00:18:32.466 --> 00:18:35.069
Mark risked his
life to save ours.


355
00:18:35.102 --> 00:18:39.772
I'm not questioning that and
believe me I'm grateful


356
00:18:39.806 --> 00:18:42.742
but just because mark is the
president of a democratic club


357
00:18:42.775 --> 00:18:46.347
doesn't mean he is the right
leader in this situation.


358
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.615
But you are?

359
00:18:47.647 --> 00:18:48.681
I didn't say that.

360
00:18:48.715 --> 00:18:51.185
No but you were thinking it.

361
00:18:51.218 --> 00:18:58.626
David's right. We haven't had a
vote.


362
00:18:58.658 --> 00:19:02.296
I make a motion that mark leads
us.


363
00:19:02.329 --> 00:19:03.330
I second the motion.

364
00:19:04.365 --> 00:19:06.267
Any discussion? Hearing none.

365
00:19:07.301 --> 00:19:09.103
All in favor? Ay.

366
00:19:13.574 --> 00:19:14.108
Ay.

367
00:19:16.776 --> 00:19:17.911
Any opposed.

368
00:19:19.313 --> 00:19:20.114
Motion carried.

369
00:19:21.382 --> 00:19:24.251
Okay well let's get to work.

A Muslim and a Jew putting up
Christmas lights.


371

That's funny I didn't even think
about that.


372
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.699
You're a journalist. You know
what people are.


373
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.571
All I'm saying is that this
whole Shangri la thing


374
00:19:43.604 --> 00:19:46.307
eventually it's gonna come down
to survival of the fittest.


375
00:19:49.276 --> 00:19:50.644
Are you listening to me?

376
00:19:50.678 --> 00:19:52.246
No.

00:19:58.118 --> 00:19:59.186
On top.

Need a hand?

381

We've got it thanks.

382
00:20:10.797 --> 00:20:12.999
Suit yourselves.

383
00:20:16.537 --> 00:20:19.273
We're putting the food in that
corner and everything else


384
00:20:19.306 --> 00:20:19.839
over there.

Right.

388
00:20:23.743 --> 00:20:24.911
Food.

389
00:20:27.414 --> 00:20:28.415
Not food.

390
00:20:30.551 --> 00:20:31.985
So we're gonna do for clothes?

391
00:20:32.018 --> 00:20:33.320
I'm partial to Armani.

392
00:20:34.622 --> 00:20:36.724
Mark went to a thrift store.

393
00:20:36.756 --> 00:20:38.459
You can't be serious.

394

everything.

00:20:54.608 --> 00:20:56.776
Did you and Daddy do something
wrong?


400
00:20:56.809 --> 00:20:59.747
No, of course not honey.

401
00:20:59.779 --> 00:21:01.115
Then why are we here?

be a better place.

No.

Not exactly.

room behind the display in


409
00:21:32.713 --> 00:21:35.982

hide.

Yeah I do.

No.

where I am.

I don't think that's a good idea
kiddo.

personal expression.

tell anyone.

clothes.

up on us do we?

00:23:52.319 --> 00:23:53.554
Sure.

451

everything else over there.

But from now on we're gonna have
to whisper.

I found this in the first aid
kit.

00:25:51.805 --> 00:25:53.206
Just one.

478
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.475
He's not military. Maybe a
neighbor?


479

Who just wandered by a
safe house?


483
00:26:17.598 --> 00:26:18.932
Maybe he's the owner?

484
00:26:18.966 --> 00:26:20.667
Or he knows the owners not here

485

and it's the best time to rob
the place.

Maybe he'll just take what he
wants and go away.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:30.510
And what if he doesn't then we
lose the element of surprise.

I'm aware that.

00:27:22.462 --> 00:27:23.430
[cough]

495
00:27:24.731 --> 00:27:25.799
I know you're there.

496
00:27:28.602 --> 00:27:29.936
I have a knife.

497
00:27:33.206 --> 00:27:35.275
And I've got a gun.

498
00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:48.989
What's your name?

499
00:27:49.023 --> 00:27:50.257
Jeff Mills.

500
00:27:53.127 --> 00:27:55.029
You're on the run ain't ya?

501
00:27:55.063 --> 00:27:56.164
Hey,

502
00:27:56.196 --> 00:27:58.099
we're asking the questions.

503
00:27:58.132 --> 00:27:59.399
Says who?

504
00:27:59.433 --> 00:28:05.073
Says the guy with the gun.

505
00:28:05.106 --> 00:28:06.473
I thought we were done for.

506
00:28:06.506 --> 00:28:08.375
Where did Mark get the gun?

507
00:28:08.408 --> 00:28:09.743
He says Martin gave it to him.

508
00:28:12.345 --> 00:28:14.681
What are you doing here?

509
00:28:14.715 --> 00:28:15.882
My job.

510
00:28:15.916 --> 00:28:17.818
Which is what?

511
00:28:17.851 --> 00:28:19.653
I winterize the lodges.

512
00:28:19.686 --> 00:28:23.557
Lock them up. Make sure the
pipes don't freeze.


513
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.093
So what you're saying is you
don't have anything do


514
00:28:25.126 --> 00:28:26.259
with the war?

515
00:28:26.293 --> 00:28:28.495
I've seen the soldiers

516
00:28:35.268 --> 00:28:36.503
So what's the story?

517
00:28:36.536 --> 00:28:39.606
Well he says he has nothing
to do with the war.


518
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.710
Do you believe him?

519
00:28:43.744 --> 00:28:44.711
I do.

520
00:28:44.745 --> 00:28:46.313
So we're detaining an innocent
man?


521
00:28:46.346 --> 00:28:48.014
What are you his lawyer now?

522
00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:50.417
Well it looks like he needs one.

523
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:52.486
Let's focus on what we're gonna
do with this guy.


524
00:28:52.519 --> 00:28:55.455
We don't have to do anything.
We just let him go.


525
00:28:55.489 --> 00:28:57.491
What makes you think that
redneck's not gonna turn us into


526
00:28:57.524 --> 00:29:00.894
the first local he comes across?
That guy's country to the core


527
00:29:00.927 --> 00:29:02.996
and I got news for you.

528
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:04.198
Those folks are not on our side.

529
00:29:04.232 --> 00:29:05.799
That's a classist assumption.

530
00:29:05.832 --> 00:29:07.667
Maybe...

531
00:29:07.701 --> 00:29:09.669
but I'm not going to gamble with
my life just to prove


532
00:29:09.703 --> 00:29:10.704
that I'm PC.

533
00:29:10.737 --> 00:29:13.673
Mark, what do you think we
should do with him?


534
00:29:13.707 --> 00:29:15.042
Well...

535
00:29:16.376 --> 00:29:18.445
I think we should lock him up.

536
00:29:20.148 --> 00:29:22.516
Are you serious?

537
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:24.351
It's ironic isn't it?

538
00:29:24.384 --> 00:29:27.287
Righteous fugitives become
reluctant jailers.


539
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.321
Locking him up.

540
00:29:28.889 --> 00:29:30.057
What would that entail?

541
00:29:31.458 --> 00:29:34.761
I can't believe you're even
considering this. Any of you.


542
00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:38.965
Where would you keep him?

543
00:29:38.999 --> 00:29:40.534
We.

544
00:29:41.735 --> 00:29:43.603
I think it's important to
realize that if we're going to


545
00:29:43.637 --> 00:29:44.971
do this,

546
00:29:45.005 --> 00:29:46.306
we're all

547
00:29:46.339 --> 00:29:48.408
going to do this.

548
00:29:55.816 --> 00:29:59.287
There's a walk in closet. We can
convert it into a cell.


549
00:29:59.319 --> 00:30:00.254
A cell?

550
00:30:00.288 --> 00:30:01.955
We can make it like a bedroom.

551
00:30:01.988 --> 00:30:03.323
What if...

552
00:30:03.356 --> 00:30:05.159
somebody misses him?

553
00:30:05.193 --> 00:30:06.593
He's not wearing a wedding ring.

554
00:30:06.626 --> 00:30:07.994
A guy like that is dating his

555
00:30:08.029 --> 00:30:11.098
right hand and a bottle of
Bourbon believe me. No one is


556
00:30:11.132 --> 00:30:13.134
going to miss this guy.

557
00:30:13.167 --> 00:30:14.835
What about the moral
considerations?


558
00:30:14.868 --> 00:30:18.172
Look, we're not talking about
hurting him.


559
00:30:18.206 --> 00:30:19.940
That isn't the point.

560
00:30:19.973 --> 00:30:21.808
And what is the point?

561
00:30:22.442 --> 00:30:23.877
It's not who we are.

562
00:30:24.845 --> 00:30:26.012
Max.

563
00:30:26.047 --> 00:30:27.581
Am I right?

564
00:30:29.482 --> 00:30:31.551
Maybe it's who we have to be.

565
00:30:35.455 --> 00:30:36.857
You don't have to do this.

566
00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:44.165
Yeah I'm afraid we do.

567
00:30:44.198 --> 00:30:46.067
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

568
00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.101
You'll get plenty of food.

569
00:30:47.134 --> 00:30:48.902
A shower a day.

570
00:30:48.935 --> 00:30:50.637
This is bullshit.

571
00:30:50.670 --> 00:30:51.838
I agree

572
00:30:51.872 --> 00:30:53.174
but

573
00:30:53.207 --> 00:30:54.841
it's the best we could do.

574
00:30:54.875 --> 00:30:56.610
Just out of curiosity,

575
00:30:56.643 --> 00:30:58.212
what do you think of the
president?


576
00:30:58.246 --> 00:31:02.482
The president is going to
win this war and scumbags like


577
00:31:02.515 --> 00:31:04.718
you are going to get bullets in
the head.


578
00:31:08.256 --> 00:31:09.623
Jack was right.

579
00:31:09.656 --> 00:31:11.858
That guy is not on our side.

580
00:31:14.095 --> 00:31:15.162
Put his truck in the garage.

581
00:31:15.196 --> 00:31:16.730
On it.

582
00:31:28.342 --> 00:31:29.377
You're not listening to me.

583
00:31:29.409 --> 00:31:31.411
I am listening to
you. What I'm not


584
00:31:31.444 --> 00:31:32.846
doing is agreeing with you.

585
00:31:32.879 --> 00:31:35.849
You realize he's just some guy
who looks after the lodge.


586
00:31:35.882 --> 00:31:38.618
That doesn't mean we can trust
him.


587
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.163
What are you doing?

588
00:31:49.196 --> 00:31:51.198
Looking for something to read.

589
00:31:52.699 --> 00:31:55.403
Shouldn't you be annoying your
parents?


590
00:31:55.435 --> 00:31:57.338
You don't like kids, do you?

591
00:31:57.371 --> 00:31:59.706
No.

592
00:31:59.739 --> 00:32:01.075
Why not?

593
00:32:02.176 --> 00:32:03.510
Because they're short.

594
00:32:04.378 --> 00:32:05.879
That's fucking stupid.

595
00:32:08.748 --> 00:32:12.253
Do your parents know that you
swear like a sailor?


596
00:32:12.286 --> 00:32:15.722
They say it's okay as long as
I use the expletives for


597
00:32:15.755 --> 00:32:17.091
emphasis.

598
00:32:18.725 --> 00:32:20.961
Do they have the lord of the
rings?


599
00:32:20.994 --> 00:32:25.865
No, just airport thrillers,
celebrity biographies,


600
00:32:25.899 --> 00:32:26.666
What are they?

601
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.668
Gossip for the mentally
deficient.


602
00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:33.174
How much do you know about the
constitution?


603
00:32:33.207 --> 00:32:35.542
Nothing.

604
00:32:35.575 --> 00:32:39.180
Now that is a situation we are
going to have to rectify.


605
00:32:39.213 --> 00:32:40.747
Sit.

606
00:32:46.519 --> 00:32:48.055
You know what this is?

607
00:32:49.123 --> 00:32:51.591
This is a copy of the
constitution of the


608
00:32:51.624 --> 00:32:53.294
United States.

609
00:32:53.327 --> 00:32:54.794
Little book.

610
00:32:54.828 --> 00:32:56.030
Big ideas.

611
00:32:56.063 --> 00:32:58.665
I regard this document with the
same reverence other people


612
00:32:58.698 --> 00:32:59.833
reserve for the Bible.

613
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.568
You know why?

614
00:33:02.802 --> 00:33:06.773
Because this is the owner's
manual for our great democracy.


615
00:33:14.415 --> 00:33:15.949
Fuck off.

616
00:33:26.793 --> 00:33:28.695
Starve if you want to.

617
00:33:28.728 --> 00:33:31.765
It won't be my doing.

618
00:33:31.798 --> 00:33:32.632
Hey.

619
00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:35.735
How long are you going to keep
me here?


620
00:33:35.769 --> 00:33:37.670
Not a moment longer than we
have to.


621
00:33:49.316 --> 00:33:52.986
Six weeks into what is now being
called America's second


622
00:33:53.019 --> 00:33:56.756
civil war, military strategists
have begun referring to


623
00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:00.627
the conflict as a war of
attrition. Neither side has gained


624
00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.996
significant ground in recent
clashes


625
00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:06.067
and it seems certain that
hostilities will extend through


626
00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.634
Christmas.

627
00:34:09.303 --> 00:34:10.104
Mom.

628
00:34:10.137 --> 00:34:11.238
What?

629
00:34:11.272 --> 00:34:13.240
I need a hat and gloves.

630
00:34:13.274 --> 00:34:14.442
What? Why?

631
00:34:14.475 --> 00:34:16.676
It's really cold outside.

632
00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.594
Thanks.

633
00:34:37.264 --> 00:34:39.266
Worried about the weather?

634
00:34:40.767 --> 00:34:43.104
The cold is going to be a
problem.


635
00:34:43.137 --> 00:34:45.004
It's gonna get worse.

636
00:34:47.607 --> 00:34:49.809
Why don't you call everybody in
for a meeting.


637
00:35:05.493 --> 00:35:07.694
[soft chatter]

638
00:35:17.003 --> 00:35:17.770
Where's Amy?

639
00:35:17.804 --> 00:35:20.541
She's reading up stairs.

640
00:35:20.574 --> 00:35:23.277
Twenty four weeks on the
outside. I mean...


641
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:25.446
All right people listen up.

642
00:35:25.479 --> 00:35:27.248
Clearly we have some decisions
to make.


643
00:35:28.382 --> 00:35:30.984
Martin is two weeks overdue.

644
00:35:31.017 --> 00:35:35.322
It doesn't look like the war is
going to be ending anytime soon


645
00:35:35.356 --> 00:35:37.158
and...

646
00:35:37.191 --> 00:35:40.261
now we're gonna have to deal
with the winter.


647
00:35:41.828 --> 00:35:44.031
We could throw a Donner party.

648
00:35:46.066 --> 00:35:47.401
Too soon?

649
00:35:51.305 --> 00:35:53.174
How much food do we have left?

650
00:35:53.207 --> 00:35:56.943
About a month's worth if we
start rationing.


651
00:35:59.946 --> 00:36:01.781
What about gas for the
generator?


652
00:36:01.814 --> 00:36:03.484
About the same.

653
00:36:03.517 --> 00:36:05.419
We could use the fireplaces for
heat.


654
00:36:06.953 --> 00:36:10.224
The smoke. You'd see it for
miles.


655
00:36:10.257 --> 00:36:11.858
So what do you think?

656
00:36:13.127 --> 00:36:15.995
One of us is going to have to go
on a supply run.


657
00:36:28.075 --> 00:36:30.944
You realize you are not gonna
have any idea where you are


658
00:36:30.977 --> 00:36:32.745
once you get out there.

659
00:36:32.779 --> 00:36:34.948
I have a watch with a compass.

660
00:36:34.981 --> 00:36:36.015
[scoffs]

661
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.718
I'll be back before you even
know it.


662
00:36:38.751 --> 00:36:41.288
Listen, I need you to be in
charge while I'm away.


663
00:36:47.894 --> 00:36:50.097
I need you to do this.

664
00:36:51.731 --> 00:36:53.267
I'll need this.

665
00:36:58.072 --> 00:36:59.005
Mark.

666
00:36:59.039 --> 00:37:02.042
You know I can still go if you
want me to.


667
00:37:02.076 --> 00:37:03.510
Thanks.

668
00:37:03.544 --> 00:37:05.079
It's gotta be me.

669
00:37:06.012 --> 00:37:07.013
Mark.

670
00:37:07.047 --> 00:37:09.483
Don't think we're not grateful.

671
00:37:09.516 --> 00:37:10.651
She's right.

672
00:37:10.684 --> 00:37:12.219
You did good.

673
00:37:14.521 --> 00:37:16.056
Hey. Get over here.

674
00:37:18.891 --> 00:37:21.028
You be careful in those woods
you hear.


675
00:37:21.061 --> 00:37:22.496
You too.

676
00:37:22.529 --> 00:37:24.698
Deal.

677
00:37:24.732 --> 00:37:26.233
Give me a hug.

678
00:37:26.267 --> 00:37:27.800
Yeah yeah yeah.

679
00:37:29.869 --> 00:37:32.072
I'll be back in a couple of
days.


680
00:37:42.316 --> 00:37:42.982
This for Mills?

681
00:37:43.016 --> 00:37:45.085
Yeah it should still be hot.

682
00:37:47.621 --> 00:37:49.023
What?

683
00:37:49.056 --> 00:37:49.657
The gun.

684
00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.226
Oh right.

685
00:38:00.234 --> 00:38:02.001
Make sure you bring it right
back.


686
00:38:03.103 --> 00:38:04.438
Yeah.

687
00:38:15.282 --> 00:38:16.550
Where's your boss?

688
00:38:16.583 --> 00:38:19.119
Mark's not my boss.

689
00:38:19.153 --> 00:38:22.756
Man, I really get you doing some
shit work don't they?


690
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.957
Get it? Shit work.

691
00:38:24.991 --> 00:38:28.329
I have a master's degree in
political science.


692
00:38:28.362 --> 00:38:30.664
So that's it.

693
00:38:30.698 --> 00:38:31.831
What?

694
00:38:31.864 --> 00:38:34.601
That's why they have you
emptying my latrine.


695
00:38:34.635 --> 00:38:36.070
Oh why is that?

696
00:38:36.103 --> 00:38:38.238
Because they're jealous.

697
00:38:38.272 --> 00:38:40.973
They know you're the one who
should be calling the shots.


698
00:38:41.007 --> 00:38:44.311
They can't handle that so what
do they do


699
00:38:44.345 --> 00:38:45.878
They make you shit boy.

700
00:38:48.182 --> 00:38:50.484
I dumped my deuce for the day.

701
00:38:50.517 --> 00:38:51.618
Run on shit boy.

702
00:38:51.652 --> 00:38:53.187
Fuck you.

703
00:39:18.812 --> 00:39:20.381
You're not on for another hour.

704
00:39:20.414 --> 00:39:21.881
I know.

705
00:39:21.914 --> 00:39:23.617
I just thought we could talk.

706
00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.519
About what?

707
00:39:25.552 --> 00:39:26.953
Do you like movies?

708
00:39:26.986 --> 00:39:28.822
Not particularly.

709
00:39:28.856 --> 00:39:30.557
I ask because the situation here

710
00:39:30.591 --> 00:39:33.293
reminds me of a
movie called The Quiet Earth.


711
00:39:33.327 --> 00:39:35.596
It's the story of a woman who
has to choose between the last


712
00:39:35.629 --> 00:39:36.764
two men on earth.

713
00:39:36.797 --> 00:39:37.865
Not gonna happen.

714
00:39:37.897 --> 00:39:39.299
What?

715
00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:42.603
Never mind two, I wouldn't sleep
with you if you're the last


716
00:39:42.636 --> 00:39:43.936
man on earth.

717
00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:45.372
Come on, I'm a journalist I'm
just asking questions.


718
00:39:45.406 --> 00:39:48.675
The latest reports
suggest that at least six


719
00:39:48.709 --> 00:39:52.546
U.N. infantry divisions have
crossed the Canadian border.


720
00:39:52.579 --> 00:39:55.749
Those divisions are expected to
begin supporting resistance


721
00:39:55.783 --> 00:40:00.287
forces in Michigan, Wisconsin
and New York by the end of


722
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.221
the week.

723
00:40:01.255 --> 00:40:02.556
Ethan.

724
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:04.191
I think I see something.

725
00:40:04.224 --> 00:40:05.492
What?

726
00:40:05.526 --> 00:40:06.693
Where?

727
00:40:06.727 --> 00:40:08.262
Over there.

728
00:40:13.133 --> 00:40:15.001
I don't see anything.

729
00:40:15.035 --> 00:40:17.504
Look again, way in the distance.

730
00:40:17.538 --> 00:40:19.540
[eerie music]

731
00:40:28.014 --> 00:40:29.416
They're not government.

732
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:31.218
And they don't look like free
America.


733
00:40:31.251 --> 00:40:32.820
It's probably just some
yahoos out to steal


734
00:40:32.853 --> 00:40:35.021
whatever they can
get their hands on.


735
00:40:35.055 --> 00:40:36.423
You mean looters?

736
00:40:37.024 --> 00:40:38.559
Every war's got them.

737
00:40:41.028 --> 00:40:43.831
The U.N. is sending troops to
support free America.


738
00:40:43.864 --> 00:40:46.400
That's great.

739
00:40:46.433 --> 00:40:48.035
Shit.

740
00:40:48.068 --> 00:40:49.770
Where's Amy?

741
00:40:49.803 --> 00:40:51.338
I don't know.

742
00:40:54.508 --> 00:40:58.512
Amy, Amy!

743
00:41:02.249 --> 00:41:03.584
Cool.

744
00:41:12.159 --> 00:41:17.364
Amy! What are you thinking?

745
00:41:19.233 --> 00:41:20.634
Where did you get this?

746
00:41:20.667 --> 00:41:21.468
It's mine.

747
00:41:21.502 --> 00:41:22.302
Who else knows about it?

748
00:41:22.336 --> 00:41:24.338
Just Dad.

749
00:41:29.343 --> 00:41:30.744
Thank God.

750
00:41:30.777 --> 00:41:31.845
Mom knows about the phone.

751
00:41:31.879 --> 00:41:33.881
Later. Is everybody
in the panic room?


752
00:41:33.914 --> 00:41:34.982
Sandy went to get Mills.

753
00:41:35.014 --> 00:41:35.983
Sandy?

754
00:41:36.015 --> 00:41:38.218
Downstairs. Go, go, go.

755
00:41:49.229 --> 00:41:50.364
I need you to come with me.

756
00:41:50.397 --> 00:41:51.632
Is there someone here? Help!

757
00:41:59.139 --> 00:42:01.708
Now get on your feet

758
00:42:01.742 --> 00:42:03.343
and keep your mouth shut.

759
00:42:03.377 --> 00:42:05.379
You bitch.

760
00:42:21.862 --> 00:42:23.130
Keep an eye on him.

761
00:42:28.769 --> 00:42:30.771
Jesus, what did you do to him?

762
00:42:30.804 --> 00:42:35.909
What I had to.

763
00:42:35.943 --> 00:42:38.378
There are two armed men up
stairs. Hopefully they're just


764
00:42:38.412 --> 00:42:40.981
gonna take what they want and
then leave but in the meantime


765
00:42:41.014 --> 00:42:42.649
I need you guys to stay back.

766
00:42:42.683 --> 00:42:43.917
What about you?

767
00:42:43.951 --> 00:42:44.785
I got the door.

768
00:42:46.353 --> 00:42:47.688
Shouldn't you have a gun?

769
00:42:47.721 --> 00:42:49.256
No.

770
00:43:52.619 --> 00:43:53.453
All clear.

771
00:43:55.989 --> 00:43:57.257
Let's see we got.

772
00:43:58.725 --> 00:44:00.594
[sighs]

773
00:44:15.509 --> 00:44:16.643
So.

774
00:44:16.677 --> 00:44:17.711
What's the damage?

775
00:44:18.679 --> 00:44:21.214
They took all the valuables they
could carry.


776
00:44:21.248 --> 00:44:22.549
We can't eat valuables.

777
00:44:22.582 --> 00:44:26.653
They also took three
quarters of the food.


778
00:44:26.687 --> 00:44:28.156
We have maybe...

779
00:44:28.188 --> 00:44:31.191
ten days if we stretch it.

780
00:44:31.224 --> 00:44:32.459
What about the gasoline?

781
00:44:32.492 --> 00:44:35.929
Gone. Not what was already in
the generator but


782
00:44:35.962 --> 00:44:37.065
everything else.

783
00:44:37.098 --> 00:44:39.199
We could use the camping
lanterns at night.


784
00:44:39.232 --> 00:44:41.001
And if we run the heat for a few
hours.


785
00:44:41.035 --> 00:44:43.770
We're gonna freeze to death.

786
00:44:43.804 --> 00:44:44.638
Okay...

787
00:44:45.972 --> 00:44:47.641
What do you suggest?

788
00:44:48.208 --> 00:44:49.443
I think we should leave.

789
00:44:50.744 --> 00:44:53.447
Because it's so much warmer out
there in the woods?


790
00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:54.715
Look...

791
00:44:54.748 --> 00:44:59.019
food's not coming to us. If we
leave now we've got ten days to


792
00:44:59.053 --> 00:45:00.520
find some.

793
00:45:00.554 --> 00:45:01.988
If we wait

794
00:45:02.022 --> 00:45:03.256
we lose that option.

795
00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.425
Didn't Mark try exactly what
you're suggesting?


796
00:45:05.459 --> 00:45:08.562
At least we'll be
doing something.


797
00:45:08.595 --> 00:45:11.231
It's not just a question of
doing something It's a question


798
00:45:11.264 --> 00:45:12.632
of doing the right thing.

799
00:45:13.834 --> 00:45:14.835
Nancy,

800
00:45:14.868 --> 00:45:16.870
what do you think?

801
00:45:19.272 --> 00:45:21.575
I think we should stay.

802
00:45:21.608 --> 00:45:23.877
There are just too many unknowns
out there.


803
00:45:25.278 --> 00:45:28.582
We don't know where we are. We
don't know which army controls


804
00:45:28.615 --> 00:45:32.053
which territories. We don't know
where to find supplies.


805
00:45:32.086 --> 00:45:33.653
We don't know where to find
shelter.


806
00:45:34.488 --> 00:45:36.256
We only have one gun.

807
00:45:38.425 --> 00:45:42.362
At least here we have a roof
over our heads.


808
00:45:42.395 --> 00:45:45.532
We have some food. We have some
protection.


809
00:45:45.565 --> 00:45:48.568
Going out there, blind and
defenseless.


810
00:45:50.337 --> 00:45:51.705
I think that's suicide.

811
00:45:52.939 --> 00:45:55.575
Why don't you tell us the real
reason you don't want to go.


812
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:57.145
I just gave you a handful.

813
00:45:57.178 --> 00:45:59.279
You know Amy would never make
it.


814
00:45:59.312 --> 00:46:00.447
Now wait a minute.

815
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.383
I'm just saying what
everybody's thinking.


816
00:46:03.416 --> 00:46:06.820
No, actually you're not.

817
00:46:06.853 --> 00:46:08.222
One speaker at a time.

818
00:46:08.256 --> 00:46:09.623
Oh.

819
00:46:09.656 --> 00:46:12.692
Wait, wait are you in charge
again because no offense but


820
00:46:12.726 --> 00:46:15.428
when those rednecks were having
a field day at our expense back


821
00:46:15.462 --> 00:46:17.798
there you weren't exactly a
pillar of strength.


822
00:46:17.831 --> 00:46:20.000
How come everyone always
prefaces an offensive


823
00:46:20.034 --> 00:46:21.868
remark by saying no offense.

824
00:46:21.902 --> 00:46:24.371
Maybe David is right.

825
00:46:26.073 --> 00:46:28.008
Maybe we do need a new leader.

826
00:46:29.143 --> 00:46:29.709
Fine.

827
00:46:30.977 --> 00:46:33.914
Now I obviously have the most
leadership experience so...


828
00:46:33.947 --> 00:46:36.483
Not the whole chief of staff
monologue again please.


829
00:46:36.516 --> 00:46:38.552
I think Nancy should take over.

830
00:46:38.585 --> 00:46:41.888
She's strong. She's reasonable.

831
00:46:41.922 --> 00:46:43.990
She's a natural leader.

832
00:46:44.025 --> 00:46:45.358
Nancy is our best option.

833
00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:47.794
Agreed.

834
00:46:47.828 --> 00:46:49.362
Agreed.

835
00:46:49.663 --> 00:46:50.664
Agreed.

836
00:46:54.835 --> 00:46:57.071
I abstain.

837
00:46:57.104 --> 00:46:58.638
I'm biased.

838
00:47:05.612 --> 00:47:07.414
Well...

839
00:47:07.447 --> 00:47:10.483
assuming Nancy is willing...

840
00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:14.588
that's five yeas...

841
00:47:15.223 --> 00:47:17.291
one nay...

842
00:47:17.325 --> 00:47:18.859
one absension.

843
00:47:20.328 --> 00:47:22.029
So.

844
00:47:22.063 --> 00:47:23.930
Do we stay or do we go?

845
00:47:25.832 --> 00:47:27.168
We stay.

846
00:47:27.201 --> 00:47:29.502
Fuck.

847
00:47:29.536 --> 00:47:30.370
Democracy's a bitch.

848
00:47:30.403 --> 00:47:32.606
Oh fuck off.

849
00:47:38.011 --> 00:47:41.414
I don't think I've ever dressed
up for bed before.


850
00:47:44.085 --> 00:47:47.487
Amy is wearing so many layers
she looks like a beach ball.


851
00:47:51.292 --> 00:47:53.827
Come on Nance, are you gonna
talk to me?


852
00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:56.730
How could you let Amy keep her
phone?


853
00:47:56.763 --> 00:47:57.697
The GPS was off.

854
00:47:57.731 --> 00:47:58.798
[scoffs]

855
00:47:58.832 --> 00:48:01.568
Do you really think anyone's
going to believe that?


856
00:48:01.601 --> 00:48:04.905
Is that what you're worried
about?


857
00:48:04.938 --> 00:48:06.107
That's it isn't it

858
00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:07.674
You're worried that if the
others find out about the phone


859
00:48:07.707 --> 00:48:10.211
they'll put somebody
else in charge.


860
00:48:10.244 --> 00:48:12.445
Why didn't you back me this
afternoon?


861
00:48:12.479 --> 00:48:14.547
You mean why'd I abstain?

862
00:48:14.581 --> 00:48:17.285
Because I don't like what this
place is doing to you.


863
00:48:17.318 --> 00:48:19.819
What protecting my daughter?

864
00:48:19.853 --> 00:48:21.021
Our daughter.

865
00:48:21.055 --> 00:48:22.656
Then act like it.

866
00:48:45.413 --> 00:48:46.513
Oh Sandy.

867
00:48:46.546 --> 00:48:48.215
You're gonna catch your death
out here.


868
00:48:48.249 --> 00:48:49.816
I keep hoping Mark will

869
00:48:49.849 --> 00:48:52.686
come driving out of the woods
with some crazy story about how


870
00:48:52.719 --> 00:48:54.888
he couldn't possibly get back
until now.


871
00:48:57.258 --> 00:48:59.026
Not that you're doing a bad job
or...


872
00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.227
No, no I get it. I understand.

873
00:49:01.228 --> 00:49:02.029
Did...

874
00:49:02.063 --> 00:49:03.897
you want something?

875
00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:04.664
Some breakfast.

876
00:49:04.698 --> 00:49:06.933
Oh geez.

877
00:49:06.967 --> 00:49:09.036
You standing out here and I
completely...


878
00:49:11.038 --> 00:49:12.672
No worries.

879
00:49:12.706 --> 00:49:14.275
I'll get on it right away.

880
00:49:14.308 --> 00:49:15.842
Thanks Sandy.

881
00:49:21.982 --> 00:49:23.250
Good morning.

882
00:49:23.284 --> 00:49:23.917
I'll take

883
00:49:25.052 --> 00:49:27.254
three eggs over easy, two
pieces of bacon and a warm


884
00:49:27.288 --> 00:49:28.422
croissant.

885
00:49:28.456 --> 00:49:30.024
And some French preserves
please.


886
00:49:34.961 --> 00:49:37.264
Or some really old oatmeal would
be great too.


887
00:49:37.298 --> 00:49:38.732
Sit down.

888
00:49:38.765 --> 00:49:41.035
I take it this is some Avant
garde art project.


889
00:49:42.569 --> 00:49:44.971
Toilet paper.

890
00:49:45.005 --> 00:49:46.539
Right.

891
00:49:59.753 --> 00:50:01.554
Nancy.

892
00:50:01.588 --> 00:50:02.922
Do you have a second?

893
00:50:02.956 --> 00:50:06.027
Of course, I was just hoping
that the looters had left


894
00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:10.663
something behind but so far
no luck. What's up?


895
00:50:10.697 --> 00:50:13.167
Max didn't do to well last
night.


896
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.634
What happened?

897
00:50:14.667 --> 00:50:16.337
The cold is debilitating.

898
00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:18.872
And I think he's been having
chest pains he's not telling


899
00:50:18.905 --> 00:50:19.572
me about.

900
00:50:19.606 --> 00:50:21.475
How do you know that?

901
00:50:21.509 --> 00:50:23.310
His nitro tablets are almost
gone.


902
00:50:25.812 --> 00:50:26.247
Okay.

903
00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.717
I'll run the heating for three
hours tonight and, uh,


904
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:32.086
could use an extra blanket?

905
00:50:32.752 --> 00:50:33.686
It couldn't hurt.

906
00:50:34.321 --> 00:50:35.322
I'll take care of it.

907
00:50:35.356 --> 00:50:36.890
Thanks.

908
00:50:45.366 --> 00:50:45.899
That's it?

909
00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:48.668
Nancy said to put Mills on half
rations.


910
00:50:49.602 --> 00:50:51.539
Given him a full portion.

911
00:50:51.571 --> 00:50:52.273
But Nancy said...

912
00:50:52.306 --> 00:50:53.807
I'll talk to Nancy.

913
00:51:08.055 --> 00:51:09.989
David, how many blankets does
Mills have?


914
00:51:11.258 --> 00:51:12.792
Two, I think.

915
00:51:12.826 --> 00:51:15.995
Take one please, we
need it for Max.


916
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:17.364
Okay.

917
00:51:22.336 --> 00:51:26.073
Hey shit boy.

918
00:51:26.107 --> 00:51:27.241
What's this?

919
00:51:27.274 --> 00:51:29.876
Your rations have been cut.

920
00:51:29.909 --> 00:51:31.978
By her?

921
00:51:32.011 --> 00:51:33.947
Me!

922
00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:36.916
I don't know. Looks like
somebody got a demotion.


923
00:51:38.185 --> 00:51:38.852
What do you mean?

924
00:51:39.786 --> 00:51:41.888
From a handgun to a crowbar...

925
00:51:41.921 --> 00:51:43.790
That's a demotion in my book.

926
00:51:44.724 --> 00:51:46.993
I don't need a gun to deal with
you.


927
00:51:47.027 --> 00:51:50.730
She took it didn't she? Your
balls and my breakfast.


928
00:51:50.763 --> 00:51:52.466
That woman's a thief.

929
00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:53.933
I'll tell you what.

930
00:51:53.967 --> 00:51:55.969
You want full portions again?

931
00:51:56.002 --> 00:51:58.539
You have to do something for me.

932
00:51:58.572 --> 00:52:01.808
I ain't going to blow you.

933
00:52:01.841 --> 00:52:03.877
How well do you know this area?

934
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:05.945
Like the back of my hand.

935
00:52:07.047 --> 00:52:07.881
Why?

936
00:52:07.914 --> 00:52:10.050
You thinking about making a run
for it?


937
00:52:11.684 --> 00:52:13.753
You are aren't you?

938
00:52:14.921 --> 00:52:17.724
If you do you're gonna need me.

939
00:52:17.757 --> 00:52:19.160
In your dreams.

940
00:52:19.193 --> 00:52:22.829
I know these woods. Sure as
shit know how to get out of 'em.


941
00:52:22.862 --> 00:52:27.034
I can find food, shelter. Hell
I'll even vouch for you if


942
00:52:27.067 --> 00:52:28.968
we run into the government
patrol.


943
00:52:31.105 --> 00:52:32.373
What do you say?

944
00:52:32.406 --> 00:52:33.940
We got a deal?

945
00:52:35.276 --> 00:52:39.280
[eerie music]

946
00:52:44.418 --> 00:52:46.654
I'm waiting.

947
00:52:46.686 --> 00:52:48.322
Give me a second, I'm thinking.

948
00:52:54.794 --> 00:52:56.763
What's the matter?

949
00:52:56.796 --> 00:52:58.599
It smells funny.

950
00:52:58.632 --> 00:52:59.567
It's old.

951
00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:02.735
It kinda smells like you.

952
00:53:02.769 --> 00:53:04.971
I'm old too.

953
00:53:05.539 --> 00:53:06.739
Where'd you get it?

954
00:53:06.773 --> 00:53:08.409
It belonged to my father.

955
00:53:08.442 --> 00:53:11.212
He had to study the constitution
to become a United


956
00:53:11.245 --> 00:53:12.479
States citizen.

957
00:53:12.513 --> 00:53:16.015
And after passing the exam, he
carried that with him everywhere


958
00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:19.086
he went, the rest of his life.

959
00:53:19.119 --> 00:53:20.920
Like you do.

960
00:53:20.954 --> 00:53:22.289
Exactly.

961
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:25.259
Amy.

962
00:53:25.292 --> 00:53:26.993
Max needs to rest.

963
00:53:27.027 --> 00:53:29.330
One more question, please?

964
00:53:34.401 --> 00:53:35.935
Okay.

965
00:53:37.937 --> 00:53:40.807
It's about the man in the
closet.


966
00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:42.443
What about him?

967
00:53:42.476 --> 00:53:45.745
If we keep him without a trial
doesn't that violate


968
00:53:45.778 --> 00:53:47.481
amedment fourteen?

969
00:53:47.514 --> 00:53:51.751
You mean not shall any state,
deprive any person, of life,


970
00:53:51.784 --> 00:53:55.021
liberty or property without due
process of law.


971
00:53:58.592 --> 00:54:00.561
That's a tough question.

972
00:54:00.594 --> 00:54:01.894
I guess I'd have to say

973
00:54:01.928 --> 00:54:03.796
that the constitution

974
00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:07.635
governs policies, affairs and
actions


975
00:54:07.668 --> 00:54:09.470
of the government.

976
00:54:09.503 --> 00:54:11.971
And we're not the government.

977
00:54:12.005 --> 00:54:13.607
We're just a group of people

978
00:54:13.641 --> 00:54:15.808
trying to survive.

979
00:54:15.842 --> 00:54:17.144
What's the difference?

980
00:54:23.217 --> 00:54:25.686
Two pairs of socks and my feet
are still freezing.


981
00:54:25.719 --> 00:54:28.255
Did you tell sandy to give mills
full rations?


982
00:54:28.289 --> 00:54:29.290
We can't starve the guy.

983
00:54:29.323 --> 00:54:32.226
No, but we can't afford to
waste extra food on


984
00:54:32.259 --> 00:54:33.560
the criminal.

985
00:54:33.594 --> 00:54:35.429
How many times do I have to
remind everyone that the man's


986
00:54:35.462 --> 00:54:38.931
only crime was being in the
wrong place at the wrong time?


987
00:54:38.965 --> 00:54:41.068
He goes back on half
rations tomorrow.


988
00:54:41.101 --> 00:54:42.303
That's it? No discussion?

989
00:54:42.336 --> 00:54:43.771
It's not a debate.

990
00:54:43.803 --> 00:54:45.773
I thought it was a conversation.

991
00:54:45.805 --> 00:54:48.509
[coughing]

992
00:54:48.542 --> 00:54:50.077
What are you doing out of bed?

993
00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:52.246
[coughiing]
...out of breath, I...


994
00:54:52.279 --> 00:54:53.813
I'm sitting...

995
00:54:53.846 --> 00:54:55.416
Why aren't you under the
blanket?


996
00:54:55.449 --> 00:54:58.118
I was choking on my back.

997
00:54:58.152 --> 00:55:00.354
We can't have you freezing
either.


998
00:55:07.728 --> 00:55:09.929
Are you having chest pain?

999
00:55:24.078 --> 00:55:26.780
I can't have you questioning my
orders.


1000
00:55:26.814 --> 00:55:27.548
What?

1001
00:55:27.581 --> 00:55:28.749
You heard me.

1002
00:55:28.782 --> 00:55:31.552
Orders? Listen to
yourself you sound like...


1003
00:55:31.585 --> 00:55:32.786
A leader? What do you want me to

1004
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:35.021
say? Somebody's got man up.

1005
00:55:37.124 --> 00:55:39.326
I don't know what to say to
that.


1006
00:55:43.896 --> 00:55:46.100
Oh, fuck.

1007
00:55:49.303 --> 00:55:50.671
Max.

1008
00:55:50.704 --> 00:55:52.706
You have to stay put.

1009
00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.109
You sound like my wife.

1010
00:55:55.142 --> 00:55:57.111
I didn't know you were married.

1011
00:55:57.144 --> 00:55:58.846
Widowed.

1012
00:55:58.878 --> 00:56:00.848
Nearly twenty years now.

1013
00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:01.815
I'm sorry.

1014
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:02.915
No.

1015
00:56:02.949 --> 00:56:05.017
It was a good life.

1016
00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.224
Try to get some sleep.

1017
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.838
That's not what you said three
days ago.


1018
00:56:24.872 --> 00:56:26.407
The situation was
different then.


1019
00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:29.843
Yeah, we had three days more
food to keep us going out there.


1020
00:56:29.877 --> 00:56:31.178
Where's Ethan?

1021
00:56:31.211 --> 00:56:32.446
I'm here.

1022
00:56:32.479 --> 00:56:34.281
What's up?

1023
00:56:34.314 --> 00:56:36.617
We're discussing whether or not
we should try to make


1024
00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:37.950
a supply run.

1025
00:56:37.984 --> 00:56:40.254
I thought we settled that.

1026
00:56:40.287 --> 00:56:42.756
The circumstances have changed.

1027
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:44.525
Max's health is failing.

1028
00:56:44.558 --> 00:56:47.528
I can't be sure without the
proper tests but I think he has


1029
00:56:47.561 --> 00:56:49.496
pneumonia as well as angina.

1030
00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:52.666
I don't have any antibiotics and
he's out of nitroglycerin


1031
00:56:52.699 --> 00:56:53.933
tablets so

1032
00:56:53.966 --> 00:56:56.503
there's nothing to treat either
condition.


1033
00:56:56.537 --> 00:56:58.705
You think we should go looking
for medicine?


1034
00:56:58.739 --> 00:56:59.939
Without it...

1035
00:56:59.972 --> 00:57:02.176
he won't be with us much longer.

1036
00:57:04.211 --> 00:57:06.180
So...

1037
00:57:06.213 --> 00:57:07.414
we go?

1038
00:57:07.448 --> 00:57:09.850
Wait, we can't sacrifice the
whole group just save one person


1039
00:57:09.883 --> 00:57:11.318
You just don't want to go.

1040
00:57:11.351 --> 00:57:14.087
No, as a matter of fact I don't.

1041
00:57:14.121 --> 00:57:16.423
We made a decision as a group,
that staying here was our best


1042
00:57:16.457 --> 00:57:19.059
shot at survival. I don't see
how Max's condition


1043
00:57:19.092 --> 00:57:20.561
changes anything.

1044
00:57:20.594 --> 00:57:23.363
Abby is talking about the death
sentence.


1045
00:57:23.397 --> 00:57:25.032
I understand that.

1046
00:57:25.065 --> 00:57:29.403
We have eight days of supplies
correct?


1047
00:57:29.436 --> 00:57:30.037
Correct.

1048
00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:32.339
Let's lay out our options.

1049
00:57:32.372 --> 00:57:33.607
Option one.

1050
00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.075
We send one person.

1051
00:57:35.108 --> 00:57:36.976
We tried that.

1052
00:57:37.009 --> 00:57:40.614
Anybody heard from mark lately?

1053
00:57:40.647 --> 00:57:43.183
Option two we send a few people.

1054
00:57:43.217 --> 00:57:45.686
That just increases the chances
of somebody talking if


1055
00:57:45.719 --> 00:57:47.154
they get caught.

1056
00:57:47.187 --> 00:57:48.755
It's got to be all of us.

1057
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:51.558
Max can't go and I won't abandon

1058
00:57:51.592 --> 00:57:52.259
a patient.

1059
00:57:52.292 --> 00:57:56.930
Fine, everybody but you and Max.

1060
00:57:56.964 --> 00:57:58.966
Ethan?

1061
00:57:58.998 --> 00:58:01.468
We can't just let him die?

1062
00:58:01.502 --> 00:58:03.170
What about Amy?

1063
00:58:03.203 --> 00:58:05.706
How well do you think she's
going to do out there?


1064
00:58:05.739 --> 00:58:07.641
What about the obvious choice?

1065
00:58:07.674 --> 00:58:10.544
We stay here. We do what we can
for Max and we wait for help.


1066
00:58:10.577 --> 00:58:13.814
I think we all know that that's
the the safest, most rational


1067
00:58:13.847 --> 00:58:15.315
thing to do.

1068
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:16.884
He's right.

1069
00:58:16.917 --> 00:58:20.521
We can't make this an emotional
decision. The last we heard


1070
00:58:20.554 --> 00:58:23.957
the U. N. was sending troops in
through Canada. For all we know


1071
00:58:23.991 --> 00:58:25.726
the war could already be over.

1072
00:58:25.759 --> 00:58:27.628
Or it could go on for months.

1073
00:58:36.603 --> 00:58:39.373
The true measure of any society
can be found in how it treats


1074
00:58:39.406 --> 00:58:41.608
its most vulnerable members.

1075
00:58:42.843 --> 00:58:44.545
What are you a fortune cookie?

1076
00:58:44.578 --> 00:58:47.948
How about this? The most justice
can be found by doing the most


1077
00:58:47.981 --> 00:58:50.183
good for the most people.

1078
00:58:54.388 --> 00:58:56.690
I'm gonna go check on Max.

1079
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.702
What about the gun?

1080
00:59:08.735 --> 00:59:10.571
What about it?

1081
00:59:10.604 --> 00:59:12.806
If anybody leaves they're gonna
need protection.


1082
00:59:14.308 --> 00:59:16.510
The gun stays with me.

1083
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:19.413
And I'm not going anywhere.

1084
00:59:21.648 --> 00:59:22.749
So what?

1085
00:59:22.783 --> 00:59:24.785
You have the gun so you decide
whether the rest of us


1086
00:59:24.818 --> 00:59:25.719
live or die?

1087
00:59:25.752 --> 00:59:27.754
[scream]

1088
00:59:37.831 --> 00:59:42.836
[murmuring conversation]

1089
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:51.712
Max left this for you.

1090
00:59:52.879 --> 00:59:54.414
Thanks.

1091
00:59:56.216 --> 00:59:58.652
Shall we begin?

1092
00:59:58.685 --> 00:59:59.920
Max...

1093
00:59:59.953 --> 01:00:01.221
well...

1094
01:00:01.254 --> 01:00:03.123
Max was a pain in the ass.

1095
01:00:04.358 --> 01:00:07.828
But he was our pain in the ass
and often enough our conscience.


1096
01:00:09.863 --> 01:00:14.167
Max was not shy about voicing
his opinion as we all know.


1097
01:00:15.769 --> 01:00:17.771
But he wasn't just a talker.

1098
01:00:19.272 --> 01:00:20.607
Max believed...

1099
01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:23.877
that our best chance...

1100
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:28.281
for survival lay in us
remaining within these walls.


1101
01:00:29.683 --> 01:00:32.886
So he did what he had to do to
make that possible.


1102
01:00:34.821 --> 01:00:39.793
To Max.

1103
01:00:40.827 --> 01:00:43.263
Does anybody know a Jewish
prayer for the dead?


1104
01:00:49.603 --> 01:00:52.172
We the people of the United
States


1105
01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.942
in order to form a more perfect
union


1106
01:00:55.976 --> 01:00:57.778

1107

provide for the common defense,


1108
01:01:02.282 --> 01:01:04.052
promote the general welfare

1109
01:01:04.085 --> 01:01:06.087
and secure the blessings of
liberty


1110
01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.555
to ourselves and our posterity,

1111
01:01:08.588 --> 01:01:11.825
do ordain and establish this
constitution


1112
01:01:11.858 --> 01:01:13.827
for the United States of
America.


1113
01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:17.597
Here here.

1114
01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:19.633
To Max.

1115
01:01:45.093 --> 01:01:46.893
We're getting out of here.

1116
01:01:46.927 --> 01:01:47.794
Great.

1117
01:01:47.828 --> 01:01:49.362
Stay there.

1118
01:01:49.396 --> 01:01:50.764
We're gonna need a map.

1119
01:01:51.898 --> 01:01:54.668
Draw the area and anything
else that might be useful.


1120
01:02:00.507 --> 01:02:02.176
I thought you said you knew this
place like the back


1121
01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:04.411
of your hand.

1122
01:02:05.445 --> 01:02:08.615
If we're both going you don't
need a map.


1123
01:02:11.219 --> 01:02:12.552
Draw it.

1124
01:02:13.054 --> 01:02:14.955
Fuck off shit boy.

1125
01:02:14.988 --> 01:02:16.523
Draw it!

1126
01:02:17.991 --> 01:02:20.128
I said fuck off!

1127
01:02:20.161 --> 01:02:25.365
Ah shit. I'm gonna kill you.

1128
01:02:27.501 --> 01:02:30.971
Why couldn't you just fucking
draw the map man?


1129

[whimpers in pain]

You okay?

1135
01:03:10.144 --> 01:03:11.011
Yeah...

1136
01:03:11.045 --> 01:03:12.412
I was just

1137
01:03:12.445 --> 01:03:15.482
wanting to straighten up some of
Max's things.


1138
01:03:15.515 --> 01:03:18.585
You know those aren't actually
Max's things.


1139
01:03:18.618 --> 01:03:19.953
I know.

1140
01:03:21.388 --> 01:03:23.090
How's Amy doing?

1141
01:03:23.124 --> 01:03:25.792
Has she said anything to you?

1142
01:03:25.826 --> 01:03:27.195
No.

1143
01:03:27.228 --> 01:03:28.762
She's resilient.

1144
01:03:48.381 --> 01:03:49.716
You know before

1145
01:03:49.749 --> 01:03:53.820
when I said somebody's gotta man
up. That was harsh.

01:03:53.854 --> 01:03:55.922
Yeah.

No! How could you do that!

01:05:37.791 --> 01:05:41.329
He was going to tell the troops
about the lodge.


1155
01:05:41.362 --> 01:05:44.597
Don't look at me like that.
Don't!


1156
01:05:44.631 --> 01:05:47.168
It's not like you were going to
do anything to stop him.


1157
01:05:47.201 --> 01:05:48.069
That's not fair.

1158
01:05:48.102 --> 01:05:49.869
Really?

1159
01:05:49.903 --> 01:05:53.374
Name one time in this whole
fucking nightmare when you put


1160
01:05:53.407 --> 01:05:55.508
your ass on the line.

1161
01:05:55.542 --> 01:05:59.080
One time when you've had
some skin in the game.


1162
01:06:04.318 --> 01:06:06.519
What are we gonna do?

1163
01:06:10.191 --> 01:06:12.193
We're gonna make him disappear.

1164
01:06:21.302 --> 01:06:24.504
One, two, three.

1165
01:06:43.057 --> 01:06:45.226
Shit!

1166
01:06:45.259 --> 01:06:47.261
Smoke!

1167
01:06:52.433 --> 01:06:54.268
Cheers.

1168
01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:55.236
To your cracker.

1169
01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:56.803
Yeah right.

1170
01:06:59.005 --> 01:07:00.540
Thank you.

1171
01:07:01.208 --> 01:07:02.842
Who lit the fire?

1172
01:07:02.876 --> 01:07:03.411
I did.

1173
01:07:03.444 --> 01:07:04.111
What?

1174
01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:06.047
The war is over.

1175
01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:06.679
It's true.

1176
01:07:06.713 --> 01:07:08.782
We heard on the radio.

1177
01:07:08.815 --> 01:07:13.521
Free America won. The government
just surrendered an hour ago.


1178
01:07:13.553 --> 01:07:14.721
An hour ago?

1179
01:07:14.754 --> 01:07:17.124
We're polishing off what's
left of the booze.


1180
01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:22.196
Are you okay?

1181
01:07:27.268 --> 01:07:28.269
Mills escaped.

1182
01:07:28.302 --> 01:07:30.770
Good for him.

1183
01:07:30.804 --> 01:07:32.972
The war is over right.

1184
01:07:33.907 --> 01:07:37.644
Don't move! Don't any of you
make a move.


1185
01:07:37.677 --> 01:07:38.345
You don't understand.

1186
01:07:38.379 --> 01:07:39.913
Shut up.

1187
01:07:46.053 --> 01:07:48.255
I can't take all of you
prisoner.


1188
01:07:49.622 --> 01:07:50.824
I'm sorry.

1189
01:07:52.592 --> 01:07:53.793
I'm sorry.

1190
01:07:55.329 --> 01:07:57.164
Soldier!

1191
01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:58.199
It's okay.

1192
01:07:58.631 --> 01:08:00.167
It's okay.

1193
01:08:01.502 --> 01:08:03.703
You don't know do you?

1194
01:08:05.039 --> 01:08:06.373
Know what?

1195
01:08:07.241 --> 01:08:09.243
The war is over.

1196
01:08:11.212 --> 01:08:12.146
Yeah right.

1197
01:08:12.179 --> 01:08:15.349
No, I'm serious. The government
surrendered.


1198
01:08:15.382 --> 01:08:17.016
We can all go home.

1199
01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:17.851
Bullshit!

1200
01:08:17.884 --> 01:08:21.355
Whoa! Easy, easy, easy. Just
please.


1201
01:08:21.388 --> 01:08:24.525
Listen to me. All right you've
been wounded and you're not


1202
01:08:24.558 --> 01:08:26.759
thinking straight
but that's okay.


1203
01:08:27.595 --> 01:08:29.430
I just need you to try

1204
01:08:29.463 --> 01:08:30.997
to focus.

1205
01:08:32.632 --> 01:08:35.336
When were you separated from
your unit?


1206
01:08:35.369 --> 01:08:36.870
Two days ago.

1207
01:08:36.903 --> 01:08:38.405
Okay, okay that's good.

1208
01:08:39.739 --> 01:08:42.443
And I'm guessing you followed
the chimney smoke here.


1209
01:08:42.476 --> 01:08:44.111
Am I right?

1210
01:08:44.145 --> 01:08:45.446
So?

1211
01:08:45.479 --> 01:08:47.780
So if the war was still on

1212
01:08:47.814 --> 01:08:51.051
we wouldn't be drawing attention
to ourselves with a fire


1213
01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:52.286
would we?

1214
01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:53.487
Maybe not.

1215
01:08:53.521 --> 01:08:54.921
No.

1216
01:08:54.954 --> 01:08:57.525
And believe me you do not want
to kill anyone after the war


1217
01:08:57.558 --> 01:08:58.992
is over.

1218
01:08:59.026 --> 01:09:02.062
A thing like that would haunt
you for the rest of your life.


1219
01:09:02.096 --> 01:09:04.831
You don't wanna be a murder do
you?


1220
01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.901
I'm a soldier.

1221
01:09:07.934 --> 01:09:09.270
Exactly.

1222
01:09:10.538 --> 01:09:12.739
Now it's time to stand down.

1223
01:09:14.441 --> 01:09:15.442
Okay.

1224
01:09:17.344 --> 01:09:18.546
Okay.

1225
01:09:18.579 --> 01:09:19.547
Okay.

1226
01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:20.780
Okay.

1227
01:09:21.482 --> 01:09:25.186
Okay, okay. We got you.

1228
01:09:25.219 --> 01:09:26.220
Okay.

1229
01:09:28.489 --> 01:09:29.689
Okay.

1230
01:09:31.425 --> 01:09:32.393
