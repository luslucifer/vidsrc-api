- Yeah?

Of course I do, because
it's your real name.

Yeah.

79
00:06:31.526 --> 00:06:34.946
You know, I think Jimmy James sounds very-

80
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:36.656
- Well, that's just-
- Singsongy.


81
00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:38.658
It's just for the act, you know.

82
00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:40.660
Why do you need an act?

83
00:06:40.743 --> 00:06:43.371
Well, I get on
stage and I gotta perform.

84
00:06:43.454 --> 00:06:46.457
Yes, why can't you just...
get on stage and perform?


85
00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:48.543
Why do you have to be a character?

86
00:06:48.626 --> 00:06:51.546
- Just a thing, you know.
- It's not.


87
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:54.298
It's not a thing. it's nothing. it's-

88
00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:59.053
it's you just sort of standing up there
with processed hair...


89
00:06:59.136 --> 00:07:01.514
- and a leopard-print jacket.
- I do think-


90
00:07:01.597 --> 00:07:03.724
- maybe that could be you.
- it's not leopard. it's cheetah.


91
00:07:03.808 --> 00:07:05.393
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.


92
00:07:05.476 --> 00:07:07.520
You know, Cheetah Club, cheetah jacket.

93
00:07:07.603 --> 00:07:09.855
- Really?
- Yeah.


94
00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:11.440
I didn't get that.

95
00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:13.651
Yeah.

96
00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:15.403
You know what Johnson said?

97
00:07:15.486 --> 00:07:18.406
You're gonna have your cheetah jacket
and you're gonna be in hiding.


98
00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:20.908
He said the suicides
were tragic and unnecessary.


99
00:07:20.992 --> 00:07:23.995
And I just really
-I don't see the-

100
00:07:27.873 --> 00:07:30.793
Why not? Why not?

101
00:07:30.876 --> 00:07:33.462
Semi-literate kids are being-

102
00:07:33.546 --> 00:07:36.716
- I know where this goes.
- Where does it go? What do you mean?


103
00:07:36.799 --> 00:07:38.801
Nowhere.

104
00:07:38.884 --> 00:07:42.221
You're so serious. We're just-just having
a good time, you know.


105
00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:46.559
Do you think I'm wrong?

106
00:07:48.436 --> 00:07:51.022
We all have situations. Yeah.

107
00:07:51.105 --> 00:07:53.608
Do we?

108
00:07:53.691 --> 00:07:55.192
Yeah, we do.

109
00:07:55.276 --> 00:07:58.237
At least we have each other.

110
00:07:58.321 --> 00:08:01.741
Most of my friends have burned their cards.

111
00:08:01.824 --> 00:08:04.952
No, if you were done with...

112
00:08:05.036 --> 00:08:08.748
the sort of cheetah and leopard-print...

113
00:08:09.707 --> 00:08:11.375
aspects of it all-

114
00:08:11.459 --> 00:08:13.919
- You mean, done with Curtis?
- Yeah, I mean-Mm-hmm.


115
00:08:14.003 --> 00:08:16.297
I mean, why? Why would I want to-

116
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.383
I think that the act at the moment
is perfectly adequate.


117
00:08:19.467 --> 00:08:23.679
But I think that that's, um... the best
thing that I can really say about it.


118
00:08:23.763 --> 00:08:26.682
You can't get down on a man's hustle.
That's his thing.


119
00:08:26.766 --> 00:08:28.976
I'm not. I've got nothing
against his hustle.


120
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.853
But...

121
00:08:30.936 --> 00:08:33.898
how much hustle...

122
00:08:33.981 --> 00:08:38.778
does it take to get you and your cheetah
jacket booked into an empty club?


123
00:08:38.861 --> 00:08:40.488
Well, that's how it is. Right?

124
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:43.616
<i>You got Curtis, and

00:08:58.422 --> 00:09:00.800
what sort of music would you play?

132
00:09:00.883 --> 00:09:02.510
I don't know.

133
00:09:02.593 --> 00:09:06.347
It's like asking, if I had a spaceship
would I go to Venus or Mars?

No, it's not!

00:11:01.754 --> 00:11:03.255
Are you listening?

159
00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:06.258
If you want something,
you take me with you.


160
00:11:06.342 --> 00:11:08.344
There's nothing down there.

161
00:11:10.846 --> 00:11:12.014
Shit.

162
00:11:20.898 --> 00:11:22.942
Better bring me some food.

163
00:11:27.488 --> 00:11:28.989
Thank you.

164
00:11:29.073 --> 00:11:32.618
Don't come back with any more goddamn
white boy albums.


165
00:11:32.701 --> 00:11:34.620
Jimmy.

166
00:11:34.703 --> 00:11:36.163
Jimmy!

167
00:12:59.038 --> 00:13:01.415
- And you weren't impressed at all?
- He's nothing.


168
00:13:01.498 --> 00:13:03.417
You didn't see the way he plays?

169
00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.211
- No, he's less than that. He's rubbish.
- Watch his hands.


170
00:13:06.295 --> 00:13:07.755
Christ.

171
00:13:07.838 --> 00:13:09.757
His hands... are amazing.

172
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:11.759
He is an incredible guitar player.

173
00:13:11.842 --> 00:13:14.261
It's not like the world's short
on guitar players.


174
00:13:14.345 --> 00:13:17.264
And what was he playing?
A bloody hodgepodge full of nothing.


175
00:13:17.348 --> 00:13:20.434
I'd lose more money on him
than I'd ever make.


176
00:13:20.517 --> 00:13:23.979
- He's brilliant. - Look, what am I to do?
I'm your boyfriend's hire.


177
00:13:24.063 --> 00:13:25.981
When he comes off tour,
shall I inform him...


178
00:13:26.065 --> 00:13:28.984
that you'd have me
divide my time between him and your friend?


179
00:13:30.819 --> 00:13:33.280
Linda, I understand more than you know.

180
00:13:33.364 --> 00:13:36.283
I'm sure I tire of being simply
the Rolling Stones' manager...


181
00:13:36.367 --> 00:13:39.536
as much as you do of being described
as Keith Richards' girl...


182
00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.289
as though that were a job description.

183
00:13:42.373 --> 00:13:45.459
Identity is a wonderful thing.

184
00:13:45.542 --> 00:13:47.628
I encourage you to have one.

185
00:13:47.711 --> 00:13:51.340
But for God's sake,
a little discretion wouldn't hurt either.


186
00:13:53.968 --> 00:13:55.511
Come on.

187
00:13:56.261 --> 00:13:57.972
- Linda.
- Have a good night.


188
00:13:58.055 --> 00:14:01.725
- <i>Oh, come on!</i>
<i>- Why should people bother?</i>


189
00:14:01.809 --> 00:14:04.561
<i>Why spend the night
coming to see you play?</i>

190
00:14:04.645 --> 00:14:06.814
Do you think that was entertaining?

191
00:14:06.897 --> 00:14:10.150
Do you think it's attractive
to watch somebody picking at their face?


192
00:14:10.234 --> 00:14:12.152
My skin's all messed up.

193
00:14:12.236 --> 00:14:14.154
No one is looking at your skin.

194
00:14:14.238 --> 00:14:16.318
You're standing up there,
and you don't say anything.


195
00:14:16.323 --> 00:14:20.285
And on the occasion that you decide
to talk, it's an inaudible mumble.


196
00:14:20.369 --> 00:14:24.248
- I'm not Keith though.
- I'm not asking you to be Keith.


197
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.919
I'm asking you to go up there
and take the stage...


198
00:14:29.003 --> 00:14:31.338
like you actually wanted
to amount to something.


199
00:14:32.256 --> 00:14:33.716
Yeah.

200
00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:35.926
Okay. Okay.

201
00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.971
You know, I've actually run out of people
to come and see you play.


202
00:14:39.054 --> 00:14:41.348
Can you look at me
when I'm talking to you?

203
00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.852
<i>Please?</i>

204
00:14:50.274 --> 00:14:52.776
<i>I've
-I've run out of people.</i>

205
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:55.362
Th
-Thank you, um-

206
00:14:55.446 --> 00:14:57.990
- Does that resonate with you on any
level whatsoever? - Yeah, I hear you.


207
00:14:58.073 --> 00:14:59.825
- Really? I don't believe you.
-I hear you!


208
00:14:59.908 --> 00:15:02.703
Hey, keep it down!
We've still got a show going on.


209
00:15:02.786 --> 00:15:05.372
Thank you! Yes!

210
00:15:21.472 --> 00:15:23.682
You know, I've never been to Harlem.

211
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:28.687
I go around pitching
rhythm and blues the whole time...


212
00:15:28.771 --> 00:15:30.731
and I've never even been to Harlem.

213
00:15:30.814 --> 00:15:33.150
So you could invite me.

214
00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.527
You wouldn't like it.

215
00:15:35.611 --> 00:15:38.447
There's nothing-
There's nothing up there for you.


216
00:15:41.408 --> 00:15:43.243
Running around New York.

217
00:15:44.536 --> 00:15:47.081
She's some kind of just-

218
00:15:49.416 --> 00:15:52.252
Everybody knows about it. Everybody.

219
00:15:52.336 --> 00:15:54.880
They all talk about the two of them.

220
00:15:54.963 --> 00:15:58.133
It's humiliating. 
Bloody humiliating.

221
00:15:58.217 --> 00:16:02.262
For you, it must be.
And I regret that. I do.


222
00:16:02.346 --> 00:16:04.932
And he's a drug addict. 
Did you know that?

223
00:16:05.015 --> 00:16:07.518
He has her strung out all the time.

224
00:16:07.601 --> 00:16:09.728
Are you just-

225
00:16:09.812 --> 00:16:13.107
You're gonna let her
run around over in America, her and her-


226
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.609
I'll check the diary,
but they'll be free at some point-


227
00:16:15.692 --> 00:16:17.569
Chas.

228
00:16:17.653 --> 00:16:21.281
Chas, hi. I'm, um
-I'm Linda Keith.

229
00:16:21.365 --> 00:16:23.408
I'm, uh, Keith Richard's girlfriend.

230
00:16:23.492 --> 00:16:25.661
- Oh! Hi.
- Hi.


231
00:16:25.744 --> 00:16:27.454
- Keith's lass.
- Yeah.


232
00:16:27.538 --> 00:16:29.790
- How are you doing?
- Fine. You?


233
00:16:29.873 --> 00:16:31.750
I'm really good.

234
00:16:31.834 --> 00:16:35.045
I think it's pretty much it for me
after this tour.


235
00:16:36.547 --> 00:16:39.216
Gone anyway. We've, uh, lost Alan.

236
00:16:39.299 --> 00:16:41.593
What, temporarily?

237
00:16:41.677 --> 00:16:44.763
No. He's uh
-He's got a fear of ﬂying.

238
00:16:44.847 --> 00:16:46.098
Honestly?

239
00:16:46.181 --> 00:16:48.350
Now you're gonna do
the new record for us?


240
00:16:48.376 --> 00:16:48.917
Yeah.

241
00:16:48.976 --> 00:16:50.976
- And it's called?
- “The House of the Rising Sun.”


242
00:16:50.978 --> 00:16:53.098
Right. Here we go then with-

243
00:16:57.693 --> 00:16:59.653
No, it's-it's done.

244
00:16:59.736 --> 00:17:02.030
I can see the writing's on the wall.

245
00:17:02.114 --> 00:17:04.992
And that manager ripped us off
something shameful to boot.


246
00:17:05.075 --> 00:17:06.618
Well, can't you sue him?

247
00:17:06.702 --> 00:17:10.455
Spending money to make money to-

248
00:17:10.539 --> 00:17:13.167
it's money I'll never see.

249
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:17.254
No, it's-I'd rather manage
a couple of acts of me own.


250
00:17:17.337 --> 00:17:20.674
Treat them proper,
start stacking up the bills.


251
00:17:21.592 --> 00:17:24.136
How about you? 
You still modeling?

252
00:17:24.219 --> 00:17:28.015
Occasionally, yeah.
Much to my father's consternation.


253
00:17:28.098 --> 00:17:30.184
Good little British girls don't model.

254
00:17:30.267 --> 00:17:32.853
I'm not really sure
what we're supposed to do...


255
00:17:32.936 --> 00:17:34.646
but apparently modeling...

256
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.732
and shacking up with the Rolling Stones...

257
00:17:36.815 --> 00:17:38.817
aren't among the options.

258
00:17:40.777 --> 00:17:42.779
Aye, well, things come.

259
00:17:43.947 --> 00:17:45.949
You know, they always do.

260
00:17:47.784 --> 00:17:50.245
Or so I've been told.

261
00:17:54.958 --> 00:17:59.546
Are you serious about giving up performing
in order to manage?


262
00:18:05.802 --> 00:18:08.430
Because I may have something for you.

263
00:18:09.765 --> 00:18:13.227
Do you think you might try
putting something else into it?


264
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.730
'Cause you're
going up on stage for a reason.


265
00:18:16.813 --> 00:18:18.523
I don't know. Maybe.

266
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:22.069
Do you think you're gonna sing?

267
00:18:22.152 --> 00:18:25.072
I think you'd have a lot more to offer
if you were to sing.


268
00:18:25.155 --> 00:18:28.075
My voice is
-Oh, it's terrible.

269
00:18:28.158 --> 00:18:31.828
But so's Dylan's.
And he's doing all right, isn't he?


270
00:18:35.165 --> 00:18:37.251
Chas really, really likes the blues.

271
00:18:45.217 --> 00:18:48.387
So if you had the mind to,
you could play something-


272
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:53.183
Bluesy? Yeah, I'll play-However you want me
to play, I'll play it. Yeah.


273
00:18:55.394 --> 00:18:57.396
Do I sound like your mother?

274
00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:05.404
I wouldn't know.

275
00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.202
Your thing, Jimmy.

276
00:19:13.203 --> 00:19:14.788
Your way.

277
00:19:15.706 --> 00:19:17.624
<i>He's quite a quiet son'.</i>

278
00:19:17.708 --> 00:19:21.670
<i>So if he doesn't say much to you
afterwards, I wouldn't take it personally.</i>


279
00:19:21.753 --> 00:19:24.798
- <i>It's not' really in his nature.</i>
<i>- Sure.</i>


280
00:19:24.881 --> 00:19:26.758
He thinks he can't-

281
00:19:26.842 --> 00:19:29.761
Well, he doesn't <i>like</i> to-
He doesn't like to sing.


282
00:19:29.845 --> 00:19:32.848
And he thinks that he has
this sort of dodgy-


283
00:19:32.931 --> 00:19:34.641
dodgy voice.

284
00:19:34.725 --> 00:19:38.312
But I don't think
it sounds funny at all, so-


285
00:19:38.395 --> 00:19:41.148
- I fancy another. Do you want another?
- Um, absolutely.


286
00:19:41.231 --> 00:19:43.108
Yeah.

287
00:19:43.191 --> 00:19:45.652
Wanna welcome everybody to the Cafe Wha.

288
00:19:45.736 --> 00:19:48.613
A real good show for you. 
A very good show.

289
00:19:48.697 --> 00:19:50.907
Your starter this afternoon...

290
00:19:50.991 --> 00:19:53.785
Mr. Jimmy James and the Blue Flames.

291
00:20:11.011 --> 00:20:12.679
All right.

292
00:21:44.271 --> 00:21:46.481
Fuck.

293
00:21:55.991 --> 00:21:59.202
So you don't play in any
of the R & B clubs in Harlem?


294
00:21:59.286 --> 00:22:01.705
No, man. Those cats are
way too strict up there.


295
00:22:01.788 --> 00:22:04.416
They don't dig cats
stretching the blues out up there.


296
00:22:04.499 --> 00:22:07.461
- I don't know what's going on with them.
- Well, fuck them.


297
00:22:07.544 --> 00:22:09.838
Yeah, fuck them. You know, I like him.

298
00:22:09.921 --> 00:22:12.090
- You're fucking brilliant.
- Thank you.


299
00:22:12.174 --> 00:22:13.967
Did Linda tell you what to play?

300
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.011
No, she just said play.

301
00:22:16.094 --> 00:22:19.514
Look, I've heard pretty much
everything there is to hear...


302
00:22:19.598 --> 00:22:21.516
and, uh, I've got to say...

303
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.895
you're taking it,
you're tearing it apart in your hands, man.


304
00:22:24.978 --> 00:22:27.814
Jesus Christ. No one's got you signed?

305
00:22:27.898 --> 00:22:31.485
- Jimmy, you're not really one
for commitments, are you? - No.


306
00:22:31.568 --> 00:22:33.987
Has Linda told you
that I'm looking to, uh-

307
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.323
Says you're looking for
people to work with.


308
00:22:36.406 --> 00:22:38.575
I wanna manage,
but I've never managed an act.


309
00:22:38.658 --> 00:22:41.077
- I've never been managed, so-
- Well, that's even Stephen.


310
00:22:41.161 --> 00:22:42.996
Okay.

311
00:22:43.079 --> 00:22:46.333
I'm off the tour in three months.

312
00:22:46.416 --> 00:22:49.503
I think it'd be a hell of a thing
if you came over to London.


313
00:22:49.586 --> 00:22:52.672
London? There's so many great cats over
there already playing though.


314
00:22:52.756 --> 00:22:55.800
Well, they haven't got you.
Eh? That's for damn sure.


315
00:22:55.884 --> 00:22:59.429
There'll be no stick-in-the-ass
about this chord or that.


316
00:22:59.513 --> 00:23:03.266
They'll be mad for what you're doing
over there. Eh?


317
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:05.769
I mean, e-everybody there,
everybody who's doing owt...


318
00:23:05.852 --> 00:23:08.146
they're all working off
the blues structure.


319
00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:10.982
I don't wanna get caught up
in those kind of labels though.


320
00:23:11.066 --> 00:23:13.235
I don't want it to be,
“He's playing the blues”...


321
00:23:13.318 --> 00:23:17.614
or “He's playing R & B or soul,”
all that kind of stuff, those cages, man.


322
00:23:17.697 --> 00:23:20.617
- I'm not saying it has to be-
- It's not about style.


323
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.244
You know, it's-

324
00:23:22.327 --> 00:23:25.705
I want my music to go
inside the soul of a person.


325
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:27.707
You know, for me it's colors.

326
00:23:27.791 --> 00:23:30.710
I want people to feel the music
the same way I see it.


327
00:23:30.794 --> 00:23:32.379
It's just colors. That's it.

328
00:23:32.462 --> 00:23:36.091
The rest is just painted with a little
science fiction here and there.


329
00:23:36.174 --> 00:23:39.386
I don't wanna freak you out this early.

330
00:23:40.554 --> 00:23:42.973
I've gotta get you over to London.

331
00:23:45.058 --> 00:23:47.644
Have you ever met a real pimp?

332
00:23:47.727 --> 00:23:50.897
Yeah, man, the pimps
wear these things out in the street.


333
00:23:51.982 --> 00:23:53.900
Yeah. They do.

334
00:23:53.984 --> 00:23:56.194
I'll wear a hat on stage.

335
00:23:56.278 --> 00:23:59.489
“Oh, man, look at that pimp
with that backwards guitar.”


336
00:23:59.573 --> 00:24:02.534
Linda,
guy looking for you. Says he's Keith.


337
00:24:03.451 --> 00:24:05.704
- Richards?
- Alan.


338
00:24:05.787 --> 00:24:08.748
Oh, um, send him back, 
I suppose, yeah.

339
00:24:08.832 --> 00:24:10.917
Who's Alan?

340
00:24:11.001 --> 00:24:13.044
He's my father.

341
00:24:13.128 --> 00:24:15.297
- You're joking, right?
- No.


342
00:24:16.965 --> 00:24:19.759
- You for real?
- Yes.


343
00:24:19.843 --> 00:24:21.678
Oh, shit.

344
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.811
Linda.

345
00:24:31.396 --> 00:24:34.858
You didn't want to ring or anything
before you arrived?


346
00:24:36.026 --> 00:24:38.111
This is Mr. Jimmy Hendrix.

347
00:24:41.531 --> 00:24:43.325
It's a pleasure.

348
00:24:46.202 --> 00:24:48.204
Collect your things.

349
00:24:49.497 --> 00:24:51.583

- No, do you know him?

Sure.

368
00:26:14.082 --> 00:26:15.291
Clapton's a mate.

can you set me up with him?

I'm not calling my pops.
No, no. I'm not calling him.

we can't make the application
for your passport.

I was telling you about.

442

and I'll be back in a minute.

- Kathy. Nice to meet you.


448

- Well, I'm from Seattle originally.

00:32:08.561 --> 00:32:10.438
Seattle. Where's that then?

450
00:32:10.521 --> 00:32:12.899
- You know California?
- Yeah, I've heard of that place.


451
00:32:12.982 --> 00:32:14.650
Well, it's north of California.

452
00:32:14.734 --> 00:32:16.652
- I like your scarf.
- Oh, thank you.


453
00:32:16.736 --> 00:32:18.821
- That's quite cool.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.


454
00:32:18.905 --> 00:32:21.074
- Yeah, I like that.
- Thank you.


455

Did you get those clothes from America?

457

Yeah, Seattle, Washington.
That's where I'm from.


460
00:32:34.003 --> 00:32:35.713
Oh, Washington!

No. No, it's the other Wash-
That's Washington DC.


462
00:32:38.925 --> 00:32:42.095
Do-Do you mind asking that woman
to move out of my seat?


463
00:32:42.178 --> 00:32:44.098
That's how we are.

464
00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.553
You're silly. I like that.

465
00:32:45.579 --> 00:32:48.167
I know. I
like that about you too.


466
00:32:48.226 --> 00:32:50.144
I don't understand geography.

467
00:32:50.228 --> 00:32:52.939
- Can you ask her to move out my seat?
- She's just having herself-


468
00:32:53.022 --> 00:32:54.941
I didn't ask you.

469
00:32:55.024 --> 00:32:56.692
Just being social, love.

470
00:32:56.776 --> 00:33:00.530
- Why don't you be social elsewhere.
- Sod off, you posh cow!


471
00:33:00.613 --> 00:33:02.949
- Do you know her?
- Yeah, she's a friend.


472
00:33:03.032 --> 00:33:05.451
Tell your fucking friend
to fuck the fuck off!


473
00:33:05.535 --> 00:33:07.161
Whoa.

474
00:33:07.245 --> 00:33:09.455
Anyway, no, I haven't been.

475
00:33:09.539 --> 00:33:12.291
You have a beautiful, beautiful mouth.

476
00:33:12.375 --> 00:33:14.961
- Hey, can I tell you something?
- Yeah, go on.


477
00:33:19.715 --> 00:33:21.592
Move out of my fucking seat!

478
00:33:21.676 --> 00:33:24.053
Fucking hell!

479
00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:28.808
- Can you just
-Can you just-

What the fuck was that?

502
00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:02.295
It was my guitar.

503
00:37:06.025 --> 00:37:08.736
I apologize for last night.

504
00:37:10.237 --> 00:37:13.783
I think I just let my emotions, urn...

505
00:37:13.866 --> 00:37:15.951
get the better of me.

506
00:37:16.035 --> 00:37:18.037
That's cool. Yeah, no problem.

507
00:37:24.043 --> 00:37:25.878
You've had one day, Jimmy.

508
00:37:25.961 --> 00:37:30.466
You've had one day in London, and you've
just made such a royal mess of things.


509
00:37:30.549 --> 00:37:32.551
Well, I-l didn't plan it.

510
00:37:33.719 --> 00:37:35.471
You know, I don't have experience.

511
00:37:35.554 --> 00:37:38.474
You're putting things out
in some kind of order?


512
00:37:38.557 --> 00:37:41.560
I mean, you pulling me from a club,
that wasn't a plan.


513
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:45.147
There's no way I could have
planned for that.


514
00:37:45.231 --> 00:37:48.234
It's just how it is.
There's no accounting for people.


515
00:37:48.317 --> 00:37:49.819
I mean, sometimes they're-

516
00:37:49.902 --> 00:37:52.696
You know, they're just like,
whoo, and everything's cool...


517
00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:55.950
and... sometimes they'd
rather just get high...


518
00:37:56.033 --> 00:37:58.369
than be a mother to their kid.

519
00:38:04.458 --> 00:38:07.461
Well, that was a very short travel...

520
00:38:08.963 --> 00:38:10.423
from your mother leaving you...

521
00:38:10.506 --> 00:38:13.509
to you fucking every girl
that you see.


522
00:38:16.429 --> 00:38:19.932
Is that how you intend to hobble along?

523
00:38:20.015 --> 00:38:21.934
Is that gonna be your crutch?

524
00:38:22.017 --> 00:38:25.104
I got no intentions.
I see how intentions do people.


525
00:38:25.187 --> 00:38:29.358
They're like, “I'm gonna plan to do this
and I'm planning to do that.”


526
00:38:29.442 --> 00:38:32.736
And as soon as things don't work out,
it fucks them all up.


527
00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:34.780
I'm not with that, man.

528
00:38:34.864 --> 00:38:38.701
I have my own thing, my own time, in its
own space, and everything is beautiful.


529
00:38:38.784 --> 00:38:40.369
All this other stuff is just-

530
00:38:40.453 --> 00:38:42.371
Well, it's reality.

531
00:38:42.455 --> 00:38:44.373
But you can't change the world.

532
00:38:44.457 --> 00:38:47.710
If I could, only thing
I'd probably do is just put-


533
00:38:47.793 --> 00:38:50.921
I'd like a little bit more color
on the streets.


534
00:38:51.005 --> 00:38:53.924
Other than that, man,
just take shit how it comes.


535
00:38:54.008 --> 00:38:55.995
But your problem is that
you're gonna stumble


536
00:38:56.021 --> 00:38:57.661
around and you're
gonna think that...


537
00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.472
that's enough...

538
00:38:59.555 --> 00:39:03.058
that genius is enough
to win the day for you...


539
00:39:03.142 --> 00:39:06.061
and that you're gonna
take things how they come.


540
00:39:06.145 --> 00:39:09.064
But this is what I'm
trying to tell you, Jimmy.


541
00:39:09.148 --> 00:39:11.650
You can't leave it to other people
to sort out your life.


542
00:39:11.734 --> 00:39:13.652
This is your life.

543
00:39:13.736 --> 00:39:15.821
Please, will you just have at it.

544
00:39:15.905 --> 00:39:18.324
- You say-
- I do, yes.


545
00:39:18.407 --> 00:39:21.243
I'm s-supposed to listen to you, huh?

546
00:39:21.327 --> 00:39:24.038
Listen to you tell me
about being more myself?


547
00:39:24.121 --> 00:39:25.664
But what's the alternative?

548
00:39:25.748 --> 00:39:28.501
You don't listen to me,
so you listen to everybody else?


549
00:39:28.584 --> 00:39:30.920
Why should I listen to you though?

550
00:39:31.003 --> 00:39:32.796
Because I love you.

551
00:39:40.554 --> 00:39:43.015
When I saw you at the Cheetah Club...

552
00:39:43.098 --> 00:39:46.685
there were about 20 people
in a space for a thousand...


553
00:39:46.769 --> 00:39:49.939
and those 20 people, they just-

554
00:39:51.106 --> 00:39:53.150
they were chatting and
they were drinking...


555
00:39:53.234 --> 00:39:56.487
and they were completely ignoring
what was happening on stage.


556
00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:59.490
And I wanted to turn to them all
and I wanted to say...


557
00:39:59.573 --> 00:40:02.618
“Are all of you completely mad?

558
00:40:02.701 --> 00:40:04.620
Can't you see him?

559
00:40:04.703 --> 00:40:06.914
Can't you see what he can do?”

560
00:40:08.624 --> 00:40:11.835
I don't think any of this
even means anything to you.


561
00:40:13.337 --> 00:40:15.714
You never listen to anything I said.

562
00:40:15.798 --> 00:40:17.341
You never have.

563
00:40:18.175 --> 00:40:19.802
I always do.

564
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:22.763
Always.

565
00:40:27.434 --> 00:40:29.645
What? What?

566
00:40:30.771 --> 00:40:32.773
What?

567
00:40:32.856 --> 00:40:37.361
The first night that we spent together
I said to you...


568
00:40:37.444 --> 00:40:40.155
“Whatever you do, don't
look in the mirror.”


569
00:40:40.239 --> 00:40:42.908
But you were giving me
junk to get high on.

570
00:40:42.992 --> 00:40:46.745
Then you gonna tell me don't look in the
mirror, and when I do you freak all out.


571
00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:49.415
Man, I mean, that's-
Come on. That's not fair.


572
00:40:49.498 --> 00:40:53.377
But every experience doesn't
need to be a reckless one.


573
00:40:54.545 --> 00:40:58.591
And being on the
bad end of a freak-out...

574
00:40:58.674 --> 00:41:02.094
that's not the way to discover
that I speak the truth.


575
00:41:06.181 --> 00:41:08.767
What did you see
when you looked in the mirror?


576
00:41:08.851 --> 00:41:11.103
Oh, man. Crazy shit.

577
00:41:11.186 --> 00:41:12.688
Like-

578
00:41:14.607 --> 00:41:17.192
I looked like Marilyn Monroe.

579
00:41:18.193 --> 00:41:20.654
Yeah.

580
00:41:28.621 --> 00:41:30.706
Mind the press, Jimmy.

581
00:41:34.084 --> 00:41:36.837
They can be absolutely voracious.

582
00:41:39.757 --> 00:41:43.302
It's best to curry a
little favor with them.


583
00:41:43.385 --> 00:41:46.472
Do you know Keith Altham?
He's a really clever one.


584
00:41:46.555 --> 00:41:49.975
Wouldn't do you any harm
to stay close to him.


585
00:41:50.059 --> 00:41:53.479
Chas has probably already thought of that.

586
00:41:53.562 --> 00:41:57.232
He's so good, Chas. You know, you're in
really good hands with him.


587
00:41:59.568 --> 00:42:02.446
Just make sure you listen to him.

588
00:43:00.337 --> 00:43:02.005
You wanna hang out?

589
00:43:22.443 --> 00:43:25.738
<i>Humming, Feedback ]</i>

590
00:44:31.386 --> 00:44:33.806
Well, it's changing. it really is.

591
00:44:33.889 --> 00:44:36.391
There's definitely room to make moves.

592
00:44:38.185 --> 00:44:40.826
I mean, the Beatles, they're done touring,
so that leaves this gap.


593
00:44:40.896 --> 00:44:42.356
Yeah.

594
00:44:42.439 --> 00:44:44.483
Then you've got the Kinks, the Small Faces.

595
00:44:44.566 --> 00:44:48.153
Everything's become more
straight-edged rock 'n' roll.


596
00:44:48.237 --> 00:44:50.364
Or harder-edged.

597
00:44:50.447 --> 00:44:54.910
I think people are more
responsive to that right now.


598
00:44:54.993 --> 00:44:57.162
I mean, look at where the world is.

599
00:44:57.246 --> 00:44:59.998
The whole world's got
an edge to it, hasn't it?


600
00:45:03.335 --> 00:45:05.087
Hasn't it?

601
00:45:05.921 --> 00:45:07.840
- I dig your hair.
- I do hair.


602
00:45:07.923 --> 00:45:09.258
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


603
00:45:09.341 --> 00:45:12.261
- I dig it a lot.
- I know all about it. Yours is cool.


604
00:45:12.344 --> 00:45:15.597
Is it natural or a permanent?
Be honest. Don't lie to me.


605
00:45:15.681 --> 00:45:17.599
No, it's God's own. Look.

606
00:45:17.683 --> 00:45:21.228
it's cool. it's like Dylan's.
I dig it a lot. Really.


607
00:45:21.311 --> 00:45:22.896
Yeah? Cheers.

608
00:45:24.189 --> 00:45:26.275
The way the advertisement was worded-

609
00:45:26.358 --> 00:45:29.528
- Does this look like a crane to you?
- No, baby.


610
00:45:29.611 --> 00:45:31.530
it doesn't have to be anything.

611
00:45:31.613 --> 00:45:33.490
It's beautiful the way it is.

612
00:45:33.574 --> 00:45:38.829
Th-The way it was worded, I thought
I was auditioning for the Animals.


613
00:45:38.912 --> 00:45:41.206
Animals? Why would you think that?

614
00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:42.916
No, not the Animals.

615
00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.919
- I am an animal, but not the Animals.
- He's an animal.


616
00:45:46.003 --> 00:45:47.880
Is
-Is the pay okay?

617
00:45:47.963 --> 00:45:49.715
<i>I'm skint.</i>

618
00:45:49.798 --> 00:45:51.717
- “Skint”? What's “skint”?
- It means broke.


619
00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.677
Oh, I dig that word.

620
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.513
W-Well, no-
The gig doesn't pay that much.


621
00:45:56.597 --> 00:45:58.098
We're skint too.

622
00:45:59.641 --> 00:46:01.435
Man, we're broke, but we're cool.

623
00:46:01.518 --> 00:46:03.312
Yeah, we have a right laugh.

624
00:46:03.395 --> 00:46:07.107
Might as well hang out with us
and be broke <i>and</i> cool.


625
00:46:09.943 --> 00:46:11.653
Better than being just broke.

626
00:46:11.737 --> 00:46:13.363
- What do you think?
- Yeah.


627
00:46:13.488 --> 00:46:17.409
-  - You're selfish.
You didn't even bring me a smoke.


628
00:46:17.492 --> 00:46:20.329
Right.
Here, <i>I'll</i> bring you a fucking smoke.


629
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:42.601
-  Hello?
- H-H-Hello?


630
00:46:42.684 --> 00:46:44.144
<i>I have an international collect call...</i>

631
00:46:44.227 --> 00:46:46.146
<i>from Jimmy Hendrix to Mr. 
AI Hendrix.</i>

632
00:46:46.229 --> 00:46:48.190
- <i>Mr. Hendrix?</i>
- <i>Uh, y-yeah.</i>


633
00:46:48.273 --> 00:46:52.110
<i>- Will you accept the charges?
- Well, who is the call from?</i>


634
00:46:52.194 --> 00:46:53.695
Hey
-Hey, Dad.

635
00:46:53.779 --> 00:46:56.949
<i>- Will you accept the charges?
- Uh, y-yeah.</i>


636
00:46:57.032 --> 00:46:59.326
- <i>Go ahead with the call.</i>
<i>- It's Jimmy.</i>


637
00:46:59.409 --> 00:47:02.955
- <i>Who?</i>
- It's your boy Jimmy. Can you hear me?


638
00:47:03.038 --> 00:47:06.583
- <i>Who?</i>
- It's Jimmy. it's your boy Jimmy.


639
00:47:06.667 --> 00:47:09.711
Check this out. 
Guess where I am.

640
00:47:09.795 --> 00:47:11.797
Guess where I am.

641
00:47:13.006 --> 00:47:14.466
I'm in London.

642
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:16.343
I'm in London, man!

643
00:47:18.053 --> 00:47:19.846
Hello?

644
00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:21.848
- Wh-Where?
- I'm in London, England.


645
00:47:21.932 --> 00:47:24.851
This cat, he pulled me out of a club
where I was playing.


646
00:47:24.935 --> 00:47:28.897
- He's managing me now, and I got my own
thing together. - <i>And that's funny?</i>


647
00:47:28.981 --> 00:47:30.899
I'm making a record.

648
00:47:30.983 --> 00:47:32.985
<i>That's funny to you?</i>

649
00:47:33.068 --> 00:47:35.445
No, I'm not trying to be funny.

650
00:47:35.529 --> 00:47:38.615
<i>Think I'm some kind of fool.</i>

651
00:47:38.699 --> 00:47:40.242
Y
-You know what?

652
00:47:40.325 --> 00:47:42.035
B
-Babe. H
-Ho-

653
00:47:42.119 --> 00:47:44.705
Dad, someone wants to talk to you.
Hold on for a second.


654
00:47:44.788 --> 00:47:48.041
Come on. Tell him.
T-Talk to him. Talk to him.


655
00:47:49.209 --> 00:47:51.128
Hiya, Mr. Hendrix. 
This is Kathy.

656
00:47:51.211 --> 00:47:54.506
- <i>Ana' who is this now?</i>
- <i>Friend of Jimmy's.</i>


657
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:58.510
It's wondrous to finally speak with you.
Jimmy's been going on about you.


658
00:47:58.593 --> 00:48:02.347
- Wh... - He's over here doing
some quite sensational things.


659
00:48:02.431 --> 00:48:05.434
He's got a manager now.
He's starting a band.


660
00:48:05.517 --> 00:48:09.104
I've heard him play, by the way.
You should be, urn, quite proud.


661
00:48:12.357 --> 00:48:13.775
Quite proud.

662
00:48:13.859 --> 00:48:16.528
<i>- Yeah. So he's in England?
- Yeah.</i>


663
00:48:16.611 --> 00:48:19.865
<i>If he's in England, why the hell
is he calling me collect?</i>


664
00:48:19.948 --> 00:48:22.492
<i>I'm not paying for any
goddamn collect call.</i>


665
00:48:22.576 --> 00:48:27.414
<i>He wants to talk to me from England, you
tell him to write me a goddamn letter.</i>


666
00:48:29.207 --> 00:48:33.378
<i>Stupid boy must think
I'm crazy or something.</i>


667
00:48:33.462 --> 00:48:35.297
<i>Hello?</i>

668
00:48:36.298 --> 00:48:37.966
- Jim?
- Hello?


669
00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:40.260
<i>There's nobody there. Hello?</i>

670
00:48:42.179 --> 00:48:44.723
- Hello?
- Yeah.


671
00:48:44.806 --> 00:48:47.726
<i>Where in the hell did you
get that kind of money?</i>


672
00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:50.729
<i>If you're there,
it's 'cause you stole a goddamn bank.</i>


673
00:48:50.812 --> 00:48:52.898
No. I didn't steal anything, man.

674
00:48:52.981 --> 00:48:55.067
I'm really doing something here.

675
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:58.820
<i>Yeah.</i>

676
00:48:59.613 --> 00:49:01.073
<i>You callin' me collect.</i>

677
00:49:01.156 --> 00:49:04.034
I gotta go. Okay?
I gotta go. All right?

678
00:49:04.117 --> 00:49:06.244
I
-I'll talk to you later.

679
00:49:06.328 --> 00:49:08.080
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

680
00:49:08.163 --> 00:49:10.832
- <i>All right.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>


681
00:49:29.643 --> 00:49:32.562
Right. All right then, gentlemen.

682
00:49:34.022 --> 00:49:36.775
Let's take stock of the situation.

683
00:49:36.858 --> 00:49:40.070
So then it's this Redding fellow
for bass guitarist, yeah?


684
00:49:40.153 --> 00:49:42.072
He's a good lad. 
He's good for it.

685
00:49:42.155 --> 00:49:44.074
Right. What about the drums?

686
00:49:44.157 --> 00:49:47.536
We are keeping the ensemble
to a three-piece, are we not?


687
00:49:47.619 --> 00:49:49.121
Aye.

688
00:49:49.204 --> 00:49:51.123
We're still looking for drummers.

689
00:49:51.206 --> 00:49:53.708
Well, get to it. 
Squandering time.

690
00:49:53.792 --> 00:49:55.794
You squander time, you squander money.

691
00:49:55.877 --> 00:49:58.839
Uh, there's a-
there's a couple of things we need to, uh-


692
00:49:58.922 --> 00:50:00.924
Jimi Hendrix and the Experience.

693
00:50:01.007 --> 00:50:03.135
Yeah. I like that. 
Quite like it.

694
00:50:03.218 --> 00:50:05.303
- Yeah?
- And it's Jimi?


695
00:50:05.387 --> 00:50:07.973
- It's J-I-M-I.
- Yeah, yeah. I like it that way.


696
00:50:08.056 --> 00:50:11.476
- Well, it was my pleasure to come
up with the idea. - No, I thought-


697
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:13.145
Your success will be thanks enough.

698
00:50:13.228 --> 00:50:16.898
We've got a couple of other things we need
to discuss actually.


699
00:50:17.899 --> 00:50:19.526
Do tell.

700
00:50:19.609 --> 00:50:21.820
Well, I've got some contracts out there.

701
00:50:21.903 --> 00:50:24.656
Stuff I signed when
I was trying to make a break.


702
00:50:24.739 --> 00:50:28.160
We were listening to some old records,
and Jimi reveals that he's-


703
00:50:28.243 --> 00:50:30.829
Just stuff that I was doing.
I was just kicking around.


704
00:50:30.912 --> 00:50:32.414
- Nothing really serious.
- Right.


705
00:50:32.497 --> 00:50:34.499
When you say “some contracts”-

706
00:50:34.583 --> 00:50:39.462
I did a recording with Curtis Knight,
and I had to sign something.


707
00:50:39.546 --> 00:50:43.258
- It was just-I was doing background work.
- A couple of contracts.


708
00:50:43.341 --> 00:50:45.594
Technically,
he's still signed on with these blokes.


709
00:50:45.677 --> 00:50:49.848
And I got one with this cat-
I was just doing session work.


710
00:50:49.931 --> 00:50:51.850
It's nothing you need to worry about.

711
00:50:51.933 --> 00:50:54.603
When you say “this cat”...

712
00:50:54.686 --> 00:50:56.188
who do you mean?

713
00:50:57.105 --> 00:50:58.690
Juggy Murray.

714
00:51:02.235 --> 00:51:05.155
- Juggy.-
- Yeah.


715
00:51:05.238 --> 00:51:07.616
Right.

716
00:51:07.699 --> 00:51:11.203
We find ourselves in
a bit of a situation.

717
00:51:11.286 --> 00:51:14.080
And I suppose
I'm off to America to handle it.


718
00:51:14.164 --> 00:51:16.917
- Handle-How are you gonna-
- The Jimi Hendrix Experience.


719
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.879
Yeah, it's better like that.
It's sharper, it's cleaner, it's faster.


720
00:51:20.962 --> 00:51:23.048
Says it all in a few words.

721
00:51:23.131 --> 00:51:26.551
You appreciate that, yeah, Jimi?
The economy of vocabulary?


722
00:51:26.635 --> 00:51:27.928
Yeah, sure.

723
00:51:28.011 --> 00:51:29.721
When I return from America...

724
00:51:29.804 --> 00:51:32.724
I may have a recording contract for you
over there as well.


725
00:51:32.807 --> 00:51:37.145
So, uh, let's get on with putting
the Experience together.


726
00:52:02.712 --> 00:52:05.966
<i>♪ Well, I had a little dog
and his name was Bob ♪</i>


727
00:52:07.759 --> 00:52:10.387
- Hey.
- Sorry, man.


728
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:14.849
Hey.I
-I
-Is that
-Is that him, man?

729
00:52:14.933 --> 00:52:16.851
There he is. God himself.

730
00:52:16.935 --> 00:52:19.771
I'll go and see if he's all right
with a quick chat.


731
00:52:25.777 --> 00:52:27.362
Eric.

732
00:52:28.989 --> 00:52:31.950
How's it going? Listen-

733
00:52:32.033 --> 00:52:35.495
Look, there's Serena.
Give a big smile and a wave.


734
00:52:36.454 --> 00:52:38.790
- Hi, love.
- What are you doing?


735
00:52:38.873 --> 00:52:41.918
- She said you'd sleep with anything that
plays a guitar. -  Cheeky bitch!


736
00:52:42.002 --> 00:52:43.753
Keith Moon doesn't play guitar!

737
00:52:43.837 --> 00:52:47.299
Fuck if I'm waving at her. You fucking
cheeky bitch! Got my eye on you!


738
00:52:47.382 --> 00:52:50.135
- Do you wanna pop over before they start?
- Yeah.


739
00:52:50.218 --> 00:52:53.179
And, hey, ask him if
I can jam with them.

740
00:52:53.263 --> 00:52:55.265
Yeah, I wanna play with them.

741
00:53:34.971 --> 00:53:37.599
Go on, get your guitar.

742
00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:34.322
Yeah!

743
00:54:59.264 --> 00:55:00.765
Go on. Yeah, go on.

744
00:55:00.849 --> 00:55:03.685
And, Jimi, he's doing this
as a favor to a friend, okay?


745
00:55:03.768 --> 00:55:05.770
- Favor to a friend.
- Yeah, okay.


746
00:55:06.771 --> 00:55:08.857
Thank you.

747
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.818
Hey, man,
really big, big fans of you guys, man.


748
00:55:11.901 --> 00:55:13.903
- Thank you.
- Hey, really big fan.


749
00:55:21.035 --> 00:55:23.288
You can plug in over there.

750
00:55:23.371 --> 00:55:24.914
Oh, no, no. Here's fine.

751
00:55:32.839 --> 00:55:35.758
I was just thinking, we could just jam a
little bit, if that's good.


752
00:55:35.842 --> 00:55:37.635
Or do you know “Killin' Floor”?

753
00:55:38.636 --> 00:55:40.388
“Mannish Boy”?

754
00:55:40.472 --> 00:55:43.391
- You know “Mannish Boy”?
- I don't much know those.


755
00:55:43.475 --> 00:55:47.145
Come on. You're a blues man. You've gotta
know these songs. I'll teach you.


756
00:55:51.399 --> 00:55:53.651
We've a guest who's
gonna sit in with us...

757
00:55:53.735 --> 00:55:56.946
who brought himself
all the way over from America.


758
00:55:58.907 --> 00:56:01.409
What's the name again, mate?

759
00:56:01.493 --> 00:56:03.453
Jimi Hendrix.

760
00:56:03.536 --> 00:56:05.788
Mr. Jimi Hendrix.

761
00:57:00.468 --> 00:57:01.970
Whoo!

762
00:57:16.859 --> 00:57:18.861
Eric.

763
00:57:18.945 --> 00:57:21.447

It was working a moment ago
and now it's stopped.


784
01:00:23.463 --> 01:00:25.256
Broken. Cheap little thing.

- Can you fix it?
- Yeah.


786

792
01:00:42.565 --> 01:00:44.776
- You look handsome.
- Thank you. Should I get it?


793
01:00:44.859 --> 01:00:47.111
- Yeah.
- Hey, how much does this run?


794
01:01:00.875 --> 01:01:02.376
He's aggressive, 
I'll say that.

795
01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.462
- In a good way or a bad way?
- He just-


796
01:01:04.545 --> 01:01:06.923
Did you see how
he was giving Jimi the eye the whole time?


797
01:01:07.006 --> 01:01:08.466
He just is. He's aggressive.

798
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:11.427
- What did you make of Aynsley?
- Well, he's solid.


799
01:01:11.511 --> 01:01:14.138
- Well, I liked him too.
- I didn't say I liked him.


800
01:01:14.222 --> 01:01:16.057
He's solid,
but he follows a bit much.


801
01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.309
Look, Chas,
I'm thankful for the gig...


802
01:01:18.392 --> 01:01:20.269
but I'm still learning my way
around the bass.


803
01:01:20.353 --> 01:01:22.980
Might be good to have someone who's
a bit more up-front.


804
01:01:23.064 --> 01:01:25.399
Might be good to find someone who shows
a bit of bloody respect.


805
01:01:25.483 --> 01:01:26.984
Oh, 'cause it's your band now, eh?

806
01:01:27.068 --> 01:01:28.528
It's called the Jimi Hendrix Experience...

807
01:01:28.611 --> 01:01:30.613
not The Two Pillocks
and a Bloke From America Experience.


808
01:01:30.696 --> 01:01:32.657
As long as we all know our place.

809
01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:34.992
I don't wanna have a big
freak-out about it.


810
01:01:35.076 --> 01:01:38.454
He's fierce, yeah.
You can't knock a cat for being fierce.


811
01:01:38.538 --> 01:01:40.498
It's like Elvin Jones
or something like that.


812
01:01:40.581 --> 01:01:42.500
Yeah, he's more jazz orientated.

813
01:01:42.583 --> 01:01:44.311
Yeah, so it won't be that
same, you know, kind


814
01:01:44.337 --> 01:01:46.028
of rock thing everybody
else is trying to do.


815
01:01:46.087 --> 01:01:47.672
Exactly.

816
01:01:47.755 --> 01:01:50.842
What were you saying about getting a bit
more experience in the Experience?


817
01:01:50.925 --> 01:01:52.844
Mmm, he's right.

818
01:01:52.927 --> 01:01:55.096
I can say what I bloody well want,
you know.


819
01:01:55.179 --> 01:01:57.640
Okay. Look.

820
01:01:59.308 --> 01:02:00.810
Aynsley.

821
01:02:01.602 --> 01:02:03.104
Mitch.

822
01:02:38.139 --> 01:02:39.682
Yeah, a bit of Little Richard.

823
01:02:39.765 --> 01:02:41.225
- Yeah, it's kinda cute.
- Thanks.


824
01:02:41.309 --> 01:02:43.269
Why do you call yourselves The Breakaways?

825
01:02:44.145 --> 01:02:45.730
This is the ultimate...

826
01:02:45.813 --> 01:02:49.567
Jimi Hendrix Experience singing experience.

827
01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:51.319
I think we should all sing in it.

828
01:02:51.402 --> 01:02:53.446
Kind of choral. 
Choral singing.

829
01:02:53.529 --> 01:02:55.090
We should have
-Hey, Breakaways.

830
01:02:55.156 --> 01:02:58.534
We should have The Breakaways
sing, like, the lead and then-


831
01:02:58.618 --> 01:03:01.203
- Not too very high.
- Yeah.


832
01:03:01.287 --> 01:03:02.914
How high can we sing, Jimi?

833
01:03:02.997 --> 01:03:06.000
En-joy.

834
01:03:09.128 --> 01:03:11.964
Forty, 45, 50, okay.

835
01:03:12.048 --> 01:03:13.633
So all-in-all that's 500.

836
01:03:13.716 --> 01:03:15.927
So it's
-That's three hours, aye?

837
01:03:16.010 --> 01:03:17.595
Two hours, Chas.

838
01:03:17.678 --> 01:03:21.432
- Oh, come on, you're breaking me heart.
- I'm doing you a favor.


839
01:03:21.515 --> 01:03:23.434
- Got the best equipment here. Best studio-
- I can see that.


840
01:03:23.517 --> 01:03:25.436
Look
-Three hours.

841
01:03:25.519 --> 01:03:28.940
- I'm gonna be counting it, Chas,
'cause I know you. - You do know me.


842
01:03:29.023 --> 01:03:30.942
So you don't need
to count it. That's 500.

843
01:03:31.025 --> 01:03:32.944
- He's not even tuned up yet.
- I can see that!


844
01:03:33.027 --> 01:03:34.904
- You've not got anyone booked-
- Two hours.


845
01:03:34.987 --> 01:03:36.489
If you're finished within two hours-

846
01:03:42.203 --> 01:03:43.955
Rolling.

847

lights down a little bit?</i>

848
01:03:46.248 --> 01:03:48.042
<i>Can we?</i>

849
01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:50.586
To create just a little mood, you know.

850
01:03:50.670 --> 01:03:53.005
<i>What's my voice sound like
in there, on the microphone?</i>


851
01:03:53.089 --> 01:03:56.300
- We've gotta lay the track, Jimi, so-
- All right, all right.


852
01:03:56.384 --> 01:03:59.637
Lights or not, however you need
to get over yourself and sing...

<i>while I've still got
the bus fare to get home, that'd be grand.</i>

All right, man, sorry.

855

- <i>No. Do you wanna tum the lights down?</i>


856
01:04:08.896 --> 01:04:11.565
Yeah, please. Yeah, 
I think it would help.

857
01:04:11.649 --> 01:04:13.442
- Thank you.
- <i>Okay.</i>


858

What are the bloody lights doing off?

860
01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:31.794
Jesus Christ Almighty! 
We're recording!

861
01:04:31.877 --> 01:04:34.380
Who records in the fucking dark?
I didn't know.


862
01:04:34.463 --> 01:04:37.425
Oh, that's grand to know!
So, you're not completely stupid!

01:04:59.113 --> 01:05:01.115
Okay, here we go.
This time no laughing, man.


870
01:05:24.930 --> 01:05:26.515
Yeah, that was a nice one.

871
01:05:26.599 --> 01:05:29.310
- Nice job. That was great, ladies.
- See you all later.


872
01:05:29.393 --> 01:05:31.729
I like what you did. 
That was out of sight.

873

It was nice.

Hey! Hey-

You let him talk to me like that? “Clingy
bitch”? You don't say a word?


876
01:05:42.490 --> 01:05:44.950
- W-What are you talking-
- I'm your bloody girlfriend.


877
01:05:45.034 --> 01:05:47.745
- What was I supposed to do?
- You're supposed to stick up for me.


878
01:05:47.828 --> 01:05:50.331
Well, fuck you!
You ruined my take, woman. What are you-

You wanna hit me?

- Get off her. Come on.

But it looks exhausting.

- Are you having fun?
- Well, yeah, yeah.

W
-We were just talking.

1065
01:15:59.231 --> 01:16:03.360
You know, he was going on about the star
child and science fiction and all that.


1066
01:16:03.443 --> 01:16:05.904
He just wanted me to stay with him
until you got back.


1067
01:16:05.987 --> 01:16:07.572
You want this?

1068
01:16:07.656 --> 01:16:09.324
He just bought it.

1069
01:16:10.450 --> 01:16:12.369
Okay.

1070
01:16:12.452 --> 01:16:13.954
I get it.

1071
01:16:16.957 --> 01:16:18.458
You're all right. You can stay.

1072
01:16:18.542 --> 01:16:20.794
- No, I'm gonna-
- No, you're all right.


1073
01:16:23.088 --> 01:16:24.589
All right.

1074
01:16:28.802 --> 01:16:30.887
I've seen him play. He's good.

1075
01:16:30.971 --> 01:16:34.224
- He's great.
- Yeah, he's gonna be a rock star one day.


1076
01:16:34.307 --> 01:16:36.560
He is a rock star. 
He already is one.

1077
01:16:37.978 --> 01:16:39.730
All right.

1078
01:16:39.813 --> 01:16:42.858
- Where's that accent from?
- Milwaukee.


1079
01:16:42.941 --> 01:16:45.485
- Don't know it.
- There's nothing to know.


1080
01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:49.197
- You been together long?
- Since he arrived.


1081
01:16:49.281 --> 01:16:50.132
Since last September.

1082
01:16:50.158 --> 01:16:52.184
Really? That's a long
time in groupie years.


1083
01:16:52.242 --> 01:16:54.119
I'm not a groupie. 
I'm his girlfriend.

1084
01:16:54.202 --> 01:16:56.997
All right, girlfriend. Okay.

1085
01:16:58.039 --> 01:16:59.541
What's your magic?

1086
01:16:59.624 --> 01:17:01.960
I'm a bloody good time.

1087
01:17:02.043 --> 01:17:05.046
We have a laugh. 
That's my magic.

1088
01:17:05.130 --> 01:17:08.425
Should have seen what I
got him away from. God.


1089
01:17:08.508 --> 01:17:11.094
All fixed teeth and plummy talk.

1090
01:17:11.178 --> 01:17:13.054
Boring..

1091
01:17:13.138 --> 01:17:16.308
- Easy's always boring.
- Hmm.


1092
01:17:20.103 --> 01:17:22.325
You ever been with any
rock 'n' rollers then?


1093
01:17:22.351 --> 01:17:23.799
Yeah, I been with plenty.

1094
01:17:23.857 --> 01:17:26.026
What was the longest?

1095
01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:30.322
Uh, one time I was with
the same cat for, uh...


1096
01:17:30.405 --> 01:17:32.282
five and a half months.

1097
01:17:32.365 --> 01:17:35.619
Five and one half. Yeah.

1098
01:17:35.702 --> 01:17:37.454
What happened?

1099
01:17:37.537 --> 01:17:41.082
Oh, he met a better-looking girl.
Wasn't no thing.


1100
01:17:41.166 --> 01:17:43.084
Then I met a bigger rock star.

1101
01:17:43.168 --> 01:17:46.087
It's all about the bigger, better deal.

1102
01:17:46.171 --> 01:17:47.923
But you don't gotta worry about that.

1103
01:17:48.006 --> 01:17:49.800
I'll never meet a bigger rock star?

1104
01:17:49.883 --> 01:17:52.594
He'll never meet a finer-looking girl.

1105
01:17:56.097 --> 01:17:58.266
<i>We're not even on the damn charts, man.</i>

1106
01:17:58.350 --> 01:18:02.187
Top 100, and we don't even
make any kind of ripple or nothing, man.


1107
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:04.481
People need to put
a face to the music.

1108
01:18:04.564 --> 01:18:07.484
You know, you need
to get seen over there.

1109
01:18:07.567 --> 01:18:11.071
What you said-You said if we wanted to win,
we have to take London.


1110
01:18:11.154 --> 01:18:13.740
<i>You have. You have taken London.</i>

1111
01:18:13.824 --> 01:18:16.243
But we've got nowt if
we don't take America.


1112
01:18:16.326 --> 01:18:17.869
It's always something with you, man.

1113
01:18:17.953 --> 01:18:20.247
You start with one thing
and then it turns into some other bullshit.


1114
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:22.833
- What is that, man?
- I'm not bullshitting you.


1115
01:18:22.916 --> 01:18:25.836
Not with the record where it's at.

1116
01:18:25.919 --> 01:18:28.505
Look, I've broke my back
to get us this far.


1117
01:18:28.588 --> 01:18:31.258
I've spent my every last pound
to get us where we are.


1118
01:18:31.341 --> 01:18:34.261
- So its about you?
- It's about the payoff.


1119
01:18:34.344 --> 01:18:37.138
For me, aye. For you. For us.

1120
01:18:37.222 --> 01:18:38.682
For the lads.

1121
01:18:38.765 --> 01:18:43.728
A hundred songs, man.
Not-Not one, man, like-


1122
01:18:43.812 --> 01:18:46.273
Just hold it together until Monterey.

1123
01:18:48.108 --> 01:18:49.609
Okay?

1124
01:18:51.278 --> 01:18:54.030
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah, man, yeah.


1125
01:19:11.882 --> 01:19:13.383
I like it though. 
You know what?

1126
01:19:13.466 --> 01:19:15.844
You sh-You should let it, like,
like-like, grow huge.


1127
01:19:15.927 --> 01:19:17.971
- <i>Like an angel.</i>
- <i>I'm gonna grow it.</i>


1128
01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:19.639
<i>I'm not gonna cut it anymore.</i>

1129
01:19:19.723 --> 01:19:22.934
Like when I had it before,
I just put loads of pomade in.


1130
01:19:23.018 --> 01:19:26.730
- Yeah.
- You know, to ﬂatten it down, but-


1131
01:19:26.813 --> 01:19:28.732
it shapes your face up really nice.

1132
01:19:28.815 --> 01:19:31.943
- We were going this way.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.


1133
01:19:32.027 --> 01:19:33.570
You know what I mean?

1134
01:19:33.653 --> 01:19:36.281
When you started. Yeah?

1135
01:19:47.959 --> 01:19:50.712
<i>Brought somebody to see you.</i>

1136
01:19:51.838 --> 01:19:53.798
- As-salaam alaikum.
- How you doing, man?


1137
01:19:53.882 --> 01:19:55.258
Hey.

1138
01:19:55.342 --> 01:19:56.843
Come in, come in.

1139
01:19:56.927 --> 01:19:59.512
<i>The government of America has failed you!</i>

1140
01:19:59.596 --> 01:20:01.139
You know Jimi, right?

1141
01:20:01.222 --> 01:20:03.342
Jimi's gonna be a rock star one day.

1142
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:06.770
Oh, no, he is a rock star.

1143
01:20:06.853 --> 01:20:08.980
That's what your girl would say, right?

1144
01:20:09.064 --> 01:20:13.276
- Wanna give Jimi some of that
good weed you got. - Yeah.


1145
01:20:13.360 --> 01:20:15.820
<i>There are Negroes now who preach to you...</i>

1146
01:20:15.904 --> 01:20:19.532
<i>that the way to freedom and equality
is through nonviolence.</i>


1147
01:20:19.616 --> 01:20:22.202
- Goddamn.
- Yeah, we have a lot of guests.


1148
01:20:22.285 --> 01:20:23.787
Where's your rolling paper at?

1149
01:20:23.870 --> 01:20:26.831
- It's in the drawer where it always is.
- All right.


1150
01:20:29.334 --> 01:20:31.252
Ah. Seen you play.

1151
01:20:31.336 --> 01:20:33.755
Jimi Hendrix, yes. 
You hella good.

1152
01:20:35.966 --> 01:20:38.301
So, how are you liking London?

1153
01:20:38.385 --> 01:20:41.012
Uh, it's a good scene.

1154
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:43.556
Yeah, “a good scene,” yeah?

1155
01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.643
So, um, where is this “good scene”?

1156
01:20:46.726 --> 01:20:48.144
Been playing at The Scotch.

1157
01:20:48.228 --> 01:20:50.897
Uh, I played down at The Bag of Nails
the other night, man.


1158
01:20:50.981 --> 01:20:52.482
Some really cool people there.

1159
01:20:52.565 --> 01:20:54.776
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


1160
01:20:54.859 --> 01:20:57.654
They relate to music differently here
than they do in America.


1161
01:20:57.737 --> 01:21:01.282
In America, it's still-Everything's
all split up still, in America.


1162
01:21:01.366 --> 01:21:03.766
You know, you have, like, one scene
for this type of music...


1163
01:21:03.827 --> 01:21:05.745
and a whole another scene
for another type of music.


1164
01:21:05.829 --> 01:21:08.391
And the moment you try
to put it all together,


1165
01:21:08.417 --> 01:21:10.650
you know, they get all
uptight with you.


1166
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:14.629
Here they just-
they give you more freedom to play...


1167
01:21:14.713 --> 01:21:17.048
and I love that.

1168
01:21:17.132 --> 01:21:21.553
You know, they let you do what you want to
do any-any time you want to.


1169
01:21:21.636 --> 01:21:23.346
What? “Let you”?

1170
01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:25.181
Yeah.

1171
01:21:25.265 --> 01:21:29.519
I'm sorry,
but you just said you had freedom to play.


1172
01:21:29.602 --> 01:21:32.042
Well, if you have freedom,
people don't “let you” do anything.


1173
01:21:32.105 --> 01:21:33.940
You just do it.

1174
01:21:38.236 --> 01:21:39.696
There's nothing in the drawer.

1175
01:21:39.779 --> 01:21:42.115
It's in the bloody drawer, man.
Look for it.


1176
01:21:43.324 --> 01:21:45.368
But, you know, good on you...

1177
01:21:45.452 --> 01:21:47.537
for coming over, enjoying yourself.

1178
01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:52.459
On behalf of England-
Well, on behalf of Black England, welcome.


1179
01:21:53.126 --> 01:21:54.627
Thank you.

1180
01:21:56.296 --> 01:21:59.966
I would think that maybe you hadn't
had much chance to see Black England.


1181
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:02.093
You know, Brixton, Notting Hill.

1182
01:22:02.177 --> 01:22:05.555
I don't break it down
like Black England or White England.


1183
01:22:06.639 --> 01:22:08.850
But it is like that.

1184
01:22:08.933 --> 01:22:10.727
They break it down.

1185
01:22:10.810 --> 01:22:13.855
Or maybe you haven't had
your share of hassles over here.


1186
01:22:15.315 --> 01:22:18.234
I read in the papers
how they talk about your music.


1187
01:22:18.318 --> 01:22:20.904
“Wild and tribal and violent.”

1188
01:22:22.822 --> 01:22:24.491
Words, man. Just words.

1189
01:22:24.574 --> 01:22:27.744
They're all just words. I don't get uptight
about them words, you know.


1190
01:22:27.827 --> 01:22:32.707
But they don't use those words when they're
talking about Jeff Beck or Eric Clapton.


1191
01:22:34.334 --> 01:22:37.253
You know,
when they play the blues, it's acceptable.


1192
01:22:37.337 --> 01:22:39.339
But when you play the blues...

1193
01:22:39.422 --> 01:22:42.801
you're a violent, black abomination.

1194
01:22:42.884 --> 01:22:44.135
Thank you.

1195
01:22:46.096 --> 01:22:48.473
England is different to America.

1196
01:22:48.556 --> 01:22:52.185
You know, our-our race issues
are more... subtle.


1197
01:22:54.062 --> 01:22:56.648
This new England was built on the Windrush.

1198
01:22:56.731 --> 01:22:59.234
You heard of that? 
You know what it is?

1199
01:22:59.317 --> 01:23:01.069
- Windrush?
- I've never heard of that.


1200
01:23:01.152 --> 01:23:03.279
After the war, right...

1201
01:23:03.363 --> 01:23:07.617
uh, Caribbeans-well, 
West Indians got, um-

1202
01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:11.287
they got lured to England, you know.

1203
01:23:11.371 --> 01:23:15.583
Lots of signs all over
the place advertising work and jobs.


1204
01:23:15.667 --> 01:23:18.545
“Come on, come over.
Work hard for a better life.”


1205
01:23:18.628 --> 01:23:20.130
Yeah, possibilities.

1206
01:23:20.213 --> 01:23:22.924
- Yeah, but there were no possibilities.
- Hmm.


1207
01:23:23.007 --> 01:23:26.261
No housing. No decent pay.

1208
01:23:26.344 --> 01:23:29.139
- There's a class system here in England.
- Notting Hill, man.


1209
01:23:29.222 --> 01:23:31.349
- There was hard work. - Those Teddy
Boys were fucking black people up.


1210
01:23:31.432 --> 01:23:32.934
But there's no better life.

1211
01:23:33.017 --> 01:23:36.437
But it's hard all over now for everybody.
Right? You know.


1212
01:23:36.521 --> 01:23:39.774
I mean, people are just people.
You know, just like animals.


1213
01:23:39.858 --> 01:23:41.526
Animals are gonna be animals, right?

1214
01:23:41.609 --> 01:23:45.697
Picking-Picking their noses,
picking their asses, you know.


1215
01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.490
Animals are animals. Yes, yes.

1216
01:23:47.574 --> 01:23:50.577
To other animals you'll never be eaten.

1217
01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:52.287
And, look, you know-

1218
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:54.914
I'm saying this brother to brother,
all right?


1219
01:23:54.998 --> 01:23:57.750
You'll never be nothing to them
but a curiosity.


1220
01:23:57.834 --> 01:24:00.378
And that's-that's the truth.

1221
01:24:01.838 --> 01:24:04.424
They don't “let you” up on that stage.
They want you up there.


1222
01:24:04.507 --> 01:24:06.134
Their electric wog.

1223
01:24:06.217 --> 01:24:07.677
Oh, that's cold, man.

1224
01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.013
You're fooling around
with all these white kids...


1225
01:24:10.096 --> 01:24:12.473
but it's black British who need
someone to inspire them.


1226
01:24:12.557 --> 01:24:15.852
- “inspire,” man.
- Why is that funny to you?


1227
01:24:15.935 --> 01:24:18.605
- You're putting things on me I don't
even wanna be. - You could be a symbol.


1228
01:24:18.688 --> 01:24:21.858
- I don't even understand. What are you
talking about? - You could be a symbol.


1229
01:24:21.941 --> 01:24:24.222
- I'm just playing my guitar.
- Play music to your people.


1230
01:24:24.277 --> 01:24:25.820
My people?

1231
01:24:27.155 --> 01:24:28.823
They're all my people. What
-What-

1232
01:24:28.907 --> 01:24:30.812
Every last one of them,
they're my people.


1233
01:24:31.826 --> 01:24:35.371
Jimi, the people you got around you now,
they don't get it.


1234
01:24:35.455 --> 01:24:39.083
If you are going up on that stage just so
you can go up on that stage...


1235
01:24:39.167 --> 01:24:41.628
you're wasting yourself.

1236
01:24:41.711 --> 01:24:45.006
- Your music should be notes of protest.
- Right the hell on, man.


1237
01:24:45.089 --> 01:24:48.635
Protest is all over with.
Everybody wants solutions now, you know.


1238
01:24:48.718 --> 01:24:50.585
You're getting up on stage
with your gyrating,


1239
01:24:50.611 --> 01:24:52.080
your gimmicks-Is
that your solution?


1240
01:24:52.138 --> 01:24:54.419
I'm sick of everybody talking about
these “gimmicks,” man.


1241
01:24:54.432 --> 01:24:58.228
You know, the world is nothing
but a great big, fat gimmick.


1242
01:24:58.311 --> 01:25:01.689
Wars, you know, napalm bombs
and all this kind of stuff.


1243
01:25:01.773 --> 01:25:06.236
You know, you got people getting burnt up
on television, right in front of our faces.


1244
01:25:06.319 --> 01:25:09.530
You know, all this violence.
And that's not my scene, man.


1245
01:25:09.614 --> 01:25:12.408
So what is your “scene”?
Laying back and doing nothing?


1246
01:25:12.492 --> 01:25:16.037
And I should be like you?
Do exactly what you're doing, huh?


1247
01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.373
Talking shit and smoking weed, huh?

1248
01:25:18.456 --> 01:25:20.416
'Cause, yeah, the weed is good, man...

1249
01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.127
but this shit that you're talking, man-

1250
01:25:23.211 --> 01:25:25.213
You
-You really wanna change things?

1251
01:25:25.296 --> 01:25:29.133
When the power of love takes over the love
of power, that's when things will change.


1252
01:25:51.864 --> 01:25:53.366
Play something!

1253
01:25:54.409 --> 01:25:57.036
- Play a fucking song!
- Get off!


1254
01:25:57.870 --> 01:25:59.580
Go on, then.

1255
01:25:59.664 --> 01:26:01.374
Where's the fucking show?

1256
01:26:02.292 --> 01:26:04.419
Paid a bloody pound for this shit!

1257
01:26:04.502 --> 01:26:06.045
Just shut your bas-

1258
01:26:06.129 --> 01:26:10.758
“Greeted by near silence, obsessive
guitar-tuning and foul gestures...


1259
01:26:10.842 --> 01:26:13.553
fans may have wondered
what they missed musically during the”-


1260
01:26:13.636 --> 01:26:15.930
- Jimi.
- I'm not in tune, man.


1261
01:26:16.014 --> 01:26:17.807
- Just play something, man.
- Man, fuck you.


1262
01:26:17.890 --> 01:26:20.560
I'm gonna get this guitar
in tune if it takes me all fucking night.


1263
01:26:20.643 --> 01:26:24.188
“Having listened to their first album,
the answer is, little.


1264
01:26:24.272 --> 01:26:28.651
Jimi Hendrix is neither a notable
songwriter, nor an accomplished vocalist.


1265
01:26:28.735 --> 01:26:31.362
<i>He is sullen when not outright angry...</i>

1266
01:26:31.446 --> 01:26:33.781
<i>vague when not utterly arcane.</i>

1267
01:26:33.865 --> 01:26:37.744
<i>The rank quality of his songs,
the puerile nature of the lyrics...</i>


1268
01:26:37.827 --> 01:26:40.842
the sum total of the
record is unrelentingly,


1269
01:26:40.868 --> 01:26:43.358
lyrically and
inartistically primal.”


1270
01:26:44.584 --> 01:26:47.503
You'd just rather play
any old kind of shit, huh?


1271
01:26:48.546 --> 01:26:50.673
And you don't care what it sounds like.

1272
01:26:50.757 --> 01:26:54.135
- Well, leave then, man!
- That didn't take them very long, did it?


1273
01:26:54.218 --> 01:26:57.096
Single didn't even chart in the States.

1274
01:26:57.972 --> 01:26:59.515
You toss in a review like that-

1275
01:26:59.599 --> 01:27:01.351
But they don't know anything.

1276
01:27:01.434 --> 01:27:03.561
I can hear the clack already.

1277
01:27:03.644 --> 01:27:07.357
People going on about whether he deserved
the Monterey invitation.


1278
01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.525
What the fuck are we here for?

1279
01:27:09.609 --> 01:27:12.111
What
-What
-What do we do all this shit for?

1280
01:27:12.195 --> 01:27:14.030
Mitch?

1281
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:19.410
<i>Where's your old lady?</i>

1282
01:27:20.912 --> 01:27:22.413
I don't know.

1283
01:27:23.623 --> 01:27:25.291
Girl runs around a lot.

1284
01:27:25.375 --> 01:27:27.543
<i>Ah, there's others.</i>

1285
01:27:27.627 --> 01:27:30.671
Whispering in his ear, filling him up.

1286
01:27:30.755 --> 01:27:32.256
Ah, just ginning him up.

1287
01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:36.260
It's disrespectful, you know.

1288
01:27:37.512 --> 01:27:39.305
Running round on you like that.

1289
01:27:39.389 --> 01:27:41.724
Jimi and the lads are supposed to
be playing the Saville Theatre.


1290
01:27:41.808 --> 01:27:43.559
Brian Epstein's chucking this big do...

1291
01:27:43.643 --> 01:27:46.354
to celebrate the new Beatles disc
and the boys are gonna be there.


1292
01:27:46.437 --> 01:27:48.898
If Jimi has another performance
like that last one...


1293
01:27:50.566 --> 01:27:53.194
we could lose Monterey.

1294
01:27:53.277 --> 01:27:55.321
We'll be done before we're started.

1295
01:28:09.794 --> 01:28:11.254
Where's your girlfriend?

1296
01:28:11.337 --> 01:28:13.005
She's
-She's at home tonight.

1297
01:28:13.089 --> 01:28:14.590
She's not coming out?

1298
01:28:21.472 --> 01:28:24.434
Hey! Hey!

1299
01:28:24.517 --> 01:28:25.810
Come here.

1300
01:28:26.853 --> 01:28:28.938
- C-Come on. Come here.

1301
01:28:29.021 --> 01:28:30.565
Come over here.

1302
01:28:30.648 --> 01:28:32.650
Okay, one minute.

1303
01:28:34.026 --> 01:28:35.736
Sit down. Sit down with me some.

1304

Come on, sit down. Sit down.

- Oh, thank you, man.
- Yeah, love your stuff, man.

Wow, thank you.
I really appreciate it. Thank you.

What is this, huh?

- Get off!
- You disrespect me!


1339

You disrespect me? Huh?

1340
01:30:29.892 --> 01:30:32.645
Who are you talking to, huh?
Who you talkin' to, huh?

- You disrespect me!
- Keep him away!

No, I'm all right. 
I'm all right.

<i>I'm okay. I'm okay.</i>

- Yeah.

- Yeah, thank you.

01:31:12.852 --> 01:31:14.061
Okay.

1348
01:32:10.034 --> 01:32:11.994
Cool?

1349
01:32:12.078 --> 01:32:15.206
I'm supposed to take, um-

1350
01:32:15.289 --> 01:32:18.000
I'm supposed to
take these for the pain...


1351
01:32:18.084 --> 01:32:20.294
and then, uh, these to help me sleep.

1352
01:32:20.378 --> 01:32:21.837
Mmm, um, later, not now.

1353
01:32:21.921 --> 01:32:23.756
I'm not-not supposed to sleep tonight.

1354
01:32:26.926 --> 01:32:28.844
I wrote these for you.

1355
01:32:42.942 --> 01:32:45.361
You write out lyrics
you can't even read yourself...


1356
01:32:45.444 --> 01:32:47.697
and that's supposed to make
everything all right?


1357
01:33:06.298 --> 01:33:09.385
I never doubted you.
That wasn't me, that was you.


1358
01:33:09.468 --> 01:33:12.388
You were the one. 
That was your shite.

<i>You got no one to blame
but you.</i>


1360

That's the bitch of it.

01:33:26.318 --> 01:33:28.195
When it comes down to things-

1362
01:33:29.363 --> 01:33:32.408
it's your own goddamn fault.

1363
01:33:32.491 --> 01:33:34.811
You know, you think getting it on
with a rock 'n' roller...


1364
01:33:34.827 --> 01:33:37.037
is gonna be nothing but good times.

1365
01:33:37.121 --> 01:33:42.001
They're the ones that make this shit real,
but it never gets real for them.


1366
01:33:43.586 --> 01:33:47.381
Their whole life-
a big motherfuckin' blowjob.


1367
01:33:48.966 --> 01:33:51.927
Can't keep thinking
it's something that it's not.


1368
01:33:52.011 --> 01:33:53.679
Him fucking around...

1369
01:33:53.763 --> 01:33:56.515
and sooner or later
he's gonna fuck his way back to you.


1370
01:33:58.184 --> 01:34:01.771
He ain't gonna fuck his way back to you.
He's just fucking <i>with</i> you.


1371
01:34:05.107 --> 01:34:08.152
Why would you say that?
Why would you say something like that?


1372
01:34:08.235 --> 01:34:10.946
'Cause I'm your sister.

1373
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:14.366
I'm not gonna let you sit there and fall
apart, thinking he loves you...


1374
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:17.077
<i>when he don't love anything but himself.</i>

1375
01:34:18.496 --> 01:34:19.997
You worn out, baby?

1376
01:34:20.873 --> 01:34:22.792
You look worn out.

1377
01:34:24.293 --> 01:34:25.836
Know what you need?

1378
01:34:26.378 --> 01:34:28.422
Hold on.

1379
01:34:28.506 --> 01:34:31.550
You have any, uh
-Let me see right here.

1380
01:34:32.635 --> 01:34:34.136
Yeah, you got some.

1381
01:34:36.388 --> 01:34:39.016
You know what? You just need
to take a couple of these, man.


1382
01:34:40.059 --> 01:34:41.393
You know?

1383
01:34:42.144 --> 01:34:43.854
Just take a couple of them.

1384
01:34:43.938 --> 01:34:46.106
Help you sleep that shit right off.

1385
01:34:47.107 --> 01:34:49.109
Maybe take a few.

1386
01:34:50.402 --> 01:34:52.446
When I'm feeling all-

1387
01:35:55.426 --> 01:35:58.012
If you need anything, 
I'll just be outside.

1388

Jimi.

1405
01:38:47.306 --> 01:38:49.099
Have a fucking good show.

1406
01:38:59.109 --> 01:39:01.236
Hey, put-put this on.
We're gonna open with that.


1407
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.821
The title track.

1408
01:39:05.491 --> 01:39:08.494
If we put this in the key of E
and go to town with it, man-


1409
01:39:08.619 --> 01:39:10.395
it only came out two days ago.
Half an hour


1410
01:39:10.421 --> 01:39:12.439
before the show, you want
us to learn a new song?


1411
01:39:12.498 --> 01:39:14.875
- We're a band. Come on, man.
- The Beatles are in the audience.


1412
01:39:14.958 --> 01:39:16.418
It's a fucking insult.

1413
01:39:16.502 --> 01:39:18.253
Only if we fuck it up.

1414
01:39:18.337 --> 01:39:20.839
Come on. Let's have fun with living, man.

1415
01:39:20.923 --> 01:39:22.883
Oh, that's cool, man.

1416
01:39:22.966 --> 01:39:24.593
All right, so Mitch, you start it off...

1417
01:39:24.676 --> 01:39:27.476
- and you give us a little rhythm and then-
- I'll give you four, yeah?


1418
01:39:42.361 --> 01:39:44.063
You-You start it off
with the beat, right.


1419
01:39:44.089 --> 01:39:44.721
Gimme four.

1420
01:39:44.780 --> 01:39:46.532
Let's keep it groovy.

1421
01:39:46.615 --> 01:39:48.117
Yeah, I like that.

1422
01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:51.745
And then I'm gonna do a solo act
after the first verse.

Perhaps we'd just secretly
run off together.

Could you tell?

01:46:37.776 --> 01:46:40.946

for me when we broke things off.

Got all these men writing songs to me.

What is it with you rock 'n' rollers?

1515
01:46:55.627 --> 01:46:57.796
You can perform for a thousand people...

1516
01:46:57.879 --> 01:47:00.382
and you can't be honest with one.

1517
01:47:01.883 --> 01:47:03.760
You can sing it all, you just...

1518
01:47:06.137 --> 01:47:07.973
can't say the words.

1519
01:47:13.478 --> 01:47:15.397
Why do you want
me to go with you?

1520
01:47:20.527 --> 01:47:23.697
Doesn't really bring me
any closer to packing my bags.


1521
01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:25.699
Good times.

1522
01:47:27.742 --> 01:47:30.078
We could have had good times here.

1523
01:47:30.161 --> 01:47:33.456
No, it's
-Here wasn't our thing.

1524
01:47:34.499 --> 01:47:36.543
Here was just way too restricted, man.

1525
01:47:36.626 --> 01:47:38.837
- It was too formal?
- Yeah.


1526
01:47:40.505 --> 01:47:42.340
So what would it be like there?

1527
01:47:42.424 --> 01:47:44.509
- Just looser.
- Looser?


1528
01:47:46.177 --> 01:47:47.971
Like unsteady?

1529
01:47:49.681 --> 01:47:51.933
You know, the minute
things take off for you...


1530
01:47:52.017 --> 01:47:55.270
I wonder if you're going to notice that
I'm not around anymore.


1531
01:47:55.353 --> 01:47:57.022
Yeah.

1532
01:48:00.150 --> 01:48:01.443
Of course.

1533
01:48:06.823 --> 01:48:08.867
Things you love, they stay with you.

1534
01:48:09.868 --> 01:48:12.120
If you want them to or not.

1535
01:48:18.293 --> 01:48:20.920
You have a very annoying way
of being...


1536
01:48:22.964 --> 01:48:26.134
quite simply profound.

<i>No, no.</i>

1559
01:50:39.976 --> 01:50:43.146

you know, or anything-anything like that.</i>


1560

1562

You know, it's art to me.
You know, and with art-


1563
01:50:52.155 --> 01:50:54.115
it's just showing something
that you've never seen before.

Or-Or even if it's something
that you see every day...

01:50:57.035 --> 01:50:58.870
just showing it in
a new way, you know.

1566
01:50:58.953 --> 01:51:02.165
So I should-I should be able to take,
like, any song and-


1567
01:51:02.248 --> 01:51:04.250
I should be able to take
“Auld Lang Syne”...


1568

and do it in a new way
you've never even heard it before.
