1
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:17.615
We have
a paid attendance tonight, 27,458.


2
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.365
That is the second drive...

3
00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:23.781
All of life is "What if?"

4
00:00:25.906 --> 00:00:30.281
I don't know that any of us
can identify what that critical role is


5
00:00:30.365 --> 00:00:33.531
that we bring to the lives
that we share in common.


6
00:00:43.115 --> 00:00:46.198
Right, in the case of
People versus Juan Ignacio Catalan...


7
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:47.490
Is that your true name?

8
00:00:47.573 --> 00:00:48.490
Yes, ma'am.

9
00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:51.406
Um, let's see...

10
00:00:52.615 --> 00:00:56.115
Well, I was born
in Los Angeles, in 1978.

11
00:00:59.698 --> 00:01:03.865
My dad bought a house in a suburb,
about 15, 20 miles north of L.A.


12
00:01:05.323 --> 00:01:09.823
My brother, Mario, started hanging around
with the wrong crowd.


13
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:13.990
I always looked up to him,
'cause he was my big brother.


14
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.698
And I just remember
seeing him coming home


15
00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:20.531
with stereos
and all types of different car parts.


16
00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:23.781
And that, I guess, intrigued me.

17
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.240
They used to break into the cars
and I would be the driver.


18
00:01:30.115 --> 00:01:32.323
That was the first time
I ever got arrested.


19
00:01:34.323 --> 00:01:39.490
I definitely wanted to make that trip
my last trip ever to jail.


20
00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:44.115
The second run
that he’s allowed to...


21
00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:58.240
Well, it was August 12th of 2003.

22
00:02:00.198 --> 00:02:04.906
Me and Alma, we had broken up.
We were having some problems.


23
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.365
I called her up and I asked if she could
come and sleep over at my house.


24
00:02:09.448 --> 00:02:10.948
It was maybe midnight,

25
00:02:11.573 --> 00:02:15.740
and he asked me, "What are you doing?"
I said, "Trying to go to sleep."


26
00:02:15.823 --> 00:02:22.448
She didn't want to, but... you know,
I'm a very persistent guy.


27
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.698
That night, I had a weird dream.

28
00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:32.240
I had a dream of UFOs
or aliens or something.


29
00:02:32.906 --> 00:02:35.906
And that I was being taken away.

30
00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:37.490
I kid you not.

31
00:02:41.448 --> 00:02:43.781
Woke up, any other day,

32
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.365
and we're driving to work,

33
00:02:47.448 --> 00:02:50.073
that's probably about 7:30 in the morning.

34
00:02:50.948 --> 00:02:53.281
We pull into our shop parking lot,

35
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:58.240
and my dad was there, of course.
He was always the first one there.


36
00:02:58.323 --> 00:02:59.656
Five, six in the morning.

37
00:03:00.906 --> 00:03:03.240
We pulled into the parking lot.

38
00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:08.490
I notice a truck,
kind of close to us.

39
00:03:09.865 --> 00:03:11.948
And that's when it all happened.

40
00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:17.656
As soon as I open the door,

41
00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:20.365
he jumps out of the car,
and he's just like...


42
00:03:24.573 --> 00:03:26.240
The only thought I
had was I was dead.

43
00:03:29.031 --> 00:03:31.906
I was completely surrounded
within 30 seconds.


44
00:03:32.906 --> 00:03:35.948
They walked up to me,
threw me on the floor,


45
00:03:36.031 --> 00:03:38.115
face down on the asphalt.

46
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.990
My dad opens the door,
and I remember, he poked his head out,


47
00:03:42.073 --> 00:03:43.281
out the door.

48
00:03:43.865 --> 00:03:47.240
And I just remember looking at my dad,
and he's like...


49
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.698
He looked at me,
and I go, "Dad, look..."

50
00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:51.115
I go, "Dad, look..."

51
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:54.073
I said, "Dad..."

52
00:03:58.406 --> 00:04:02.073
I'm Detective Rodriguez,
partner to Detective Pinner, okay?


53
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:05.073
Hey, what's going on?
That's all I want to know.


54
00:04:05.781 --> 00:04:08.323
We're hoping that
you're going to talk to us.


55
00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:10.615
Are you willing to talk to us
about what's going on?


56
00:04:10.698 --> 00:04:12.115
What's going on?

57
00:04:12.615 --> 00:04:15.240
Next, one of the detectives
showed up to the house.


58
00:04:16.073 --> 00:04:18.365
State your full name
for the record, sir.


59
00:04:18.448 --> 00:04:19.615
It's Juan Rodriguez.

60
00:04:20.198 --> 00:04:22.115
He says, "Well..."

61
00:04:24.698 --> 00:04:27.198
He's like, "He was arrested."

62
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:29.698
And I said, "I get that.
Why was he arrested?"


63
00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:33.531
And he's like,
"Because the murder of Martha Puebla."


64
00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:34.990
And I said, "Excuse me?"

65
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:39.073
And I think that I was speechless
for like five minutes.


66
00:04:41.365 --> 00:04:42.698
Juan was in jail,

67
00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:47.573
charged with the May 12, 2003
murder of 16-year-old Martha Puebla.


68
00:04:47.656 --> 00:04:50.573
The young woman had testified
in a separate case


69
00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:53.406
in which Juan's brother
was a co-defendant.


70
00:04:53.948 --> 00:04:55.823
Everyone makes mistakes.

71
00:04:55.906 --> 00:04:59.615
Just some people make bigger mistakes
than others.


72
00:05:00.115 --> 00:05:02.156
And they're not easily undone.

73
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.365
My brother had been arrested
for a murder.


74
00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:10.406
And we went to his preliminary hearing.

75
00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:16.615
When we were in court, they did ask us
to provide our driver's license or IDs.


76
00:05:17.323 --> 00:05:22.740
One thing I remember very clearly
is Martha Puebla was a witness.


77
00:05:24.031 --> 00:05:26.990
They wanted her
to point out the shooter in court.


78
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.573
But she never said anything.
She goes, "I didn't see anything."


79
00:05:32.448 --> 00:05:34.615
And I never thought anything of it.

80
00:05:34.698 --> 00:05:35.615
I...

81
00:05:36.198 --> 00:05:39.240
took it as we were watching
someone testify.


82
00:05:40.531 --> 00:05:41.740
Do you solemnly state

83
00:05:41.823 --> 00:05:43.740
the evidence you shall present
in this matter


84
00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:46.156
shall be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,


85
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.115
so help you God?

86
00:05:47.198 --> 00:05:48.156
I do.

87
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:50.573
You are going to take away my life

88
00:05:50.656 --> 00:05:52.740
for this fucking bullshit?

89
00:05:52.823 --> 00:05:55.281
The bullshit is this.
You killed somebody.


90
00:05:55.365 --> 00:05:58.156
Wait a minute.
Those are very strong words right there.


91
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.948
I did not kill nobody,
I would never kill nobody.


92
00:06:01.031 --> 00:06:03.406
I'd never do anything to hurt anybody.

93
00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:06.281
Convince us otherwise.

94
00:06:12.615 --> 00:06:14.698
I remembered my cousin.

95
00:06:15.198 --> 00:06:18.365
He would always brag
about this kick-ass lawyer


96
00:06:18.906 --> 00:06:22.073
that he was a filing clerk for.

97
00:06:23.448 --> 00:06:26.031
Las Vegas.
It's a great place to go and have fun!


98
00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:27.365
We went there to uncover

99
00:06:27.448 --> 00:06:29.781
some of the sneaks,
cheaters, and sore losers,


100
00:06:29.865 --> 00:06:31.365
and they were all caught on tape.

101
00:06:32.156 --> 00:06:35.156
When I first met Juan,
I was in a criminal defense practice,


102
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.906
as I had been for probably ten years.

103
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.615
Naturally, I asked him
about the facts of the case.


104
00:06:42.365 --> 00:06:44.240
I got this story...

105
00:06:45.323 --> 00:06:46.573
that I wasn't expecting.

106
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:50.865
Detective Pinner,
what time did the 911 call go out


107
00:06:50.948 --> 00:06:53.906
with respect to this murder on May 12th?

108
00:06:54.865 --> 00:06:58.031
22:43, that's 10:43 p.m.

109
00:06:58.698 --> 00:07:02.531
I didn't know what the evidence was,
how many witnesses they claimed they had.


110
00:07:02.615 --> 00:07:03.615
I didn't know anything.

111
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.073
At the time that
the defendant was arrested,


112
00:07:08.156 --> 00:07:11.448
- did he have any facial hair?
- Yes.


113
00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:13.365
And what did the facial hair look like?

114
00:07:13.448 --> 00:07:18.990
He had a mustache and a...
He was slightly unshaven,


115
00:07:19.073 --> 00:07:22.031
with a small piece of hair
below his bottom lip.


116
00:07:23.323 --> 00:07:26.323
They showed me the sketch
and said that was me.


117
00:07:26.906 --> 00:07:29.156
Male Hispanic,
black hair, very short,


118
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.031
5'7" to 5'11",

119
00:07:31.115 --> 00:07:32.865
19 to 25 years old.

120
00:07:32.948 --> 00:07:35.573
Stocky build, medium mustache...

121
00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:38.406
Hair below his lip?
I've never had nothing under my lip.


122
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.990
- What's there right now?
- I haven't shaved!


123
00:07:41.073 --> 00:07:43.323
Okay, so you didn't shave
this day either.


124
00:07:43.406 --> 00:07:45.240
Why wouldn't I shave
my mustache then?


125
00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:48.323
I don't know.
'Cause you think you're cool.


126
00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:50.698
Because you think
there were no witnesses.


127
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:52.281
But there were witnesses.

128
00:07:52.365 --> 00:07:54.698
I asked him,
"Was the death penalty mentioned?"


129
00:07:54.781 --> 00:07:56.365
Yes, death penalty was mentioned.

130
00:07:57.573 --> 00:08:01.323
They had a paper
with my picture on it,


131
00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:03.156
and they're like, "Yeah, this is him."

132
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.365
That's all they would say: "This is him."

133
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.406
Please, you guys
can't do this to me, dude.


134
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:11.531
I swear to God, man, on my two daughters
that I love so much, man,


135
00:08:11.615 --> 00:08:12.990
I did not do this.

136
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.198
People identified you.
The composite is you.


137
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:18.573
You see,
the pictures don't lie.


138
00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:21.615
I mean, I just had a gut feeling,

139
00:08:21.698 --> 00:08:24.948
there's just no way this kid
could have committed a murder.


140
00:08:25.031 --> 00:08:29.031
I mean, it just seemed
completely out of his character.


141
00:08:30.031 --> 00:08:33.698
And so I told him,
"I'm gonna get you outta here."


142
00:08:39.281 --> 00:08:43.115
Well, did you investigate
Juan Catalan in any way, shape, or form


143
00:08:43.198 --> 00:08:46.323
before you had him arrested
on August 12th?


144
00:08:47.365 --> 00:08:49.240
- Yes.
- What did you do?


145
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:54.156
I wanted the chronological log
that the detectives are supposed to follow


146
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.198
every time they do something on the case.

147
00:08:56.281 --> 00:08:58.406
We showed his picture to the witness.

148
00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:59.698
And?

149
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.698
We verified that he had
an apparent motive.


150
00:09:04.198 --> 00:09:07.906
Then I started to ask him, "All right,
do you remember where you were?"


151
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.031
♪ And the home ♪

152
00:09:11.115 --> 00:09:17.865
♪ Of the brave ♪

153
00:09:18.073 --> 00:09:20.365
May 12th, I said,
"That's around Mother's Day."


154
00:09:20.823 --> 00:09:23.990
I'm like, "You know what?
Juan, you were at a Dodger game."


155
00:09:24.073 --> 00:09:27.073
He had bought some tickets for his mom
to go to the Dodger game,


156
00:09:27.156 --> 00:09:28.948
knowing full well
she probably wouldn't go.


157
00:09:29.031 --> 00:09:30.490
Yeah, I did.

158
00:09:30.573 --> 00:09:31.906
I got those tickets, you know,

159
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:34.281
trying to pull them off
as a Mother's Day gift.


160
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.698
If we can prove
you were at the game,


161
00:09:37.781 --> 00:09:39.448
get the case thrown out, easy!

162
00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:42.698
Uh... not so easy.

163
00:09:47.781 --> 00:09:50.115
First of all, I wasn't supposed to be
at that game.


164
00:09:50.906 --> 00:09:52.865
We are pleased to welcome

165
00:09:52.948 --> 00:09:56.948
more than 2,000 City of El Segundo
employees, families and friends


166
00:09:57.031 --> 00:09:58.156
to tonight's game.

167
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.365
I didn't know who to take
because it was such short notice,


168
00:10:02.448 --> 00:10:05.115
so I thought of my daughter, of course.

169
00:10:05.198 --> 00:10:06.656
You know, she was six.

170
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.323
And she doesn't get into the games,

171
00:10:08.406 --> 00:10:10.823
but just her being there,
she gets excited.


172
00:10:11.823 --> 00:10:14.448
I took my cousin Miguel,
who's also a sports fan,


173
00:10:14.531 --> 00:10:16.490
and a good friend of mine, Ruben.

174
00:10:17.323 --> 00:10:20.656
Didn't think much of it,
just another Dodger game.


175
00:10:21.698 --> 00:10:24.656
According to the eyewitnesses
and the police reports,


176
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.240
Martha Puebla was at her residence.

177
00:10:27.323 --> 00:10:31.573
She had come outside to talk
to a couple of other young adults,


178
00:10:31.656 --> 00:10:33.198
right around ten o'clock at night.

179
00:10:33.406 --> 00:10:39.156
We have a paid
attendance tonight, 27,458.


180
00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:42.365
They were going back and forth...

181
00:10:46.115 --> 00:10:48.865
During the time
that these four or five people


182
00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:51.448
were just outside of Martha's house,

183
00:10:51.531 --> 00:10:56.156
they saw a Chevy Malibu drive slowly
around the block several times.


184
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.740
It was a tie,
going into the ninth inning,


185
00:10:59.823 --> 00:11:01.615
and I'm like, "We're not going nowhere."

186
00:11:02.198 --> 00:11:06.865
Éric Gagné comes in
and he would go into Mike Kinkade's spot.


187
00:11:07.865 --> 00:11:11.365
The person driving the car
came out the car and came up to Martha.


188
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.615
That's a strike.

189
00:11:13.865 --> 00:11:16.156
He came in,
and I was like, "We got this.


190
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.406
You know,
he's going to nail this ninth inning,


191
00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.115
we're gonna come up
and hit the game-winning hit."


192
00:11:21.198 --> 00:11:26.656
Marcus Giles, with runners
in scoring position, is hitting .355.


193
00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.073
Martha says,
"Hey, it's Martha, you remember me."


194
00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:32.698
And the shooter says something
to the effect of, "No, you don't."


195
00:11:32.781 --> 00:11:36.115
Pulls a gun out of his sweatshirt,
and then shoots Martha in the head.


196
00:11:36.198 --> 00:11:38.990
Ground ball up the middle!
Cora can't block it!


197
00:11:39.073 --> 00:11:43.115
And the runner's gonna come in.
Furcal scores,


198
00:11:43.198 --> 00:11:48.365
Giles scores, and the game
has come apart on Éric Gagné.


199
00:11:48.448 --> 00:11:51.240
Oh man, they rocked them
for like seven runs.


200
00:11:51.323 --> 00:11:54.698
A 4-4 tie became an 11-4 game,

201
00:11:54.781 --> 00:11:58.281
and I'm like, "Oh, dude."
It's over, let's get out of here.


202
00:11:58.365 --> 00:12:00.865
Having just witnessed
an execution-style murder,


203
00:12:00.948 --> 00:12:04.865
the main and only eyewitness in this case
dropped his cell phone


204
00:12:04.948 --> 00:12:06.781
and ran as fast as he could.

205
00:12:06.865 --> 00:12:09.740
I grabbed my daughter's hand
and we're walking towards the exit


206
00:12:09.823 --> 00:12:13.906
and I see a stand of baseball cards,
so I had to stop, I had to stop.


207
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:16.823
Police talked
to the owner of the cell phone.


208
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.365
He looks at tons and tons of photos

209
00:12:19.948 --> 00:12:23.281
and eventually gives a sketch
of what he thinks the person looks like


210
00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:24.490
that killed Martha.

211
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:27.073
We opened up the packs,
and that was it.


212
00:12:27.656 --> 00:12:29.740
That was the night, nothing else.

213
00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:36.448
First of all, we had
an eyewitness who identified him,


214
00:12:36.948 --> 00:12:42.323
and cooperated with a composite artist
within days of the homicide,


215
00:12:42.406 --> 00:12:44.240
and came up with a composite

216
00:12:44.323 --> 00:12:48.406
that was strikingly similar
to the defendant in appearance.


217
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.656
The prosecutor they assigned to the case

218
00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.323
had never lost a murder case
ever before in her career.


219
00:12:54.823 --> 00:12:56.865
She was murdered
because she did testify,


220
00:12:56.948 --> 00:13:01.531
and the day that she testified,
which was May 1st of 2003,


221
00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:06.573
Juan Catalan was present in the audience
during his brother's preliminary hearing


222
00:13:06.656 --> 00:13:08.073
when this girl testified.

223
00:13:08.156 --> 00:13:09.948
Her nickname was Sniper,

224
00:13:10.031 --> 00:13:13.490
because she likes to pick off people
with the death penalty.


225
00:13:14.073 --> 00:13:19.573
Do you think Juan Catalan
has any kind of a legitimate alibi at all?


226
00:13:20.156 --> 00:13:21.073
No.

227
00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:28.990
I asked Alma to find the tickets,
but not to touch them.


228
00:13:29.073 --> 00:13:31.323
We turned the apartment upside down.

229
00:13:31.406 --> 00:13:33.198
Couldn't find the tickets...

230
00:13:33.281 --> 00:13:35.531
I'm going to show you three tickets here.

231
00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:38.156
... until finally,
I found a Dodger envelope.


232
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.906
Which of these tickets
was the one that you possessed?


233
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:45.573
The next thing that I did
was I contacted Sam Fernandez.


234
00:13:45.656 --> 00:13:48.073
Senior Vice President,
General Counsel for the Dodgers.


235
00:13:49.406 --> 00:13:52.156
I don't really know
what was going through my mind


236
00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.906
when I received that call.

237
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.448
"Well, here's another interesting day
at the office," if you will.


238
00:13:58.656 --> 00:14:00.990
He came to the stadium
and we walked down to the seats.


239
00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.740
I wanted
to take photos of the seats,


240
00:14:03.823 --> 00:14:06.365
where they were
in relation to the Dodger dugout.


241
00:14:07.115 --> 00:14:10.240
I mean,
I am standing in Dodger Stadium.


242
00:14:11.823 --> 00:14:13.365
I was shackled up

243
00:14:13.906 --> 00:14:19.865
and put into a individual cage
in the jail bus.


244
00:14:20.698 --> 00:14:22.781
I definitely felt...

245
00:14:24.615 --> 00:14:26.698
that it had just become...

246
00:14:27.823 --> 00:14:30.323
That... it just became real.

247
00:14:30.406 --> 00:14:33.281
I saw a county bus.
I was coming home from work.


248
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:35.156
Uh...

249
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.490
And I just had this weird feeling
inside of me,


250
00:14:38.573 --> 00:14:41.490
and I just broke down crying
by myself in the car.


251
00:14:43.156 --> 00:14:45.656
Juan got his phone call
later on that evening,


252
00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.906
and calls me and tells me,
"Alma, I saw you on the freeway."


253
00:14:49.323 --> 00:14:50.698
I'm like, "No way!"

254
00:14:50.781 --> 00:14:52.740
He's like, "I saw you on the freeway."

255
00:14:53.198 --> 00:14:56.031
He's like, "I saw you.
You were about to get the 5 to go home,


256
00:14:56.115 --> 00:14:58.156
and we kept going the opposite way."

257
00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.740
He's like, "I wish I could have jumped
out of that window


258
00:15:00.823 --> 00:15:01.865
and go home with you."

259
00:15:05.573 --> 00:15:07.865
Really,
what he was looking for was some way


260
00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:09.531
of trying to identify the people

261
00:15:09.615 --> 00:15:11.781
who may have been sitting
around his client,


262
00:15:11.865 --> 00:15:15.073
who could actually testify
that his client was there.


263
00:15:15.698 --> 00:15:18.656
They are season tickets
that Juan got from somebody.


264
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.990
Because someone's a season ticket holder
doesn't mean they were at that game.


265
00:15:23.323 --> 00:15:26.573
So we tracked down people
as far west as Hawaii,


266
00:15:27.073 --> 00:15:29.406
and as far east as Chicago.

267
00:15:29.906 --> 00:15:33.656
Everybody we talked to: "You know,
I really didn't see them well enough


268
00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.865
that I would feel comfortable testifying."

269
00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:41.115
They transferred me to supermax,
which is maximum security,


270
00:15:41.198 --> 00:15:43.448
with the hardest criminals there.

271
00:15:43.948 --> 00:15:49.031
You really don't know what fear is

272
00:15:49.115 --> 00:15:53.531
until you hear
a grown man screaming for help.


273
00:15:56.073 --> 00:15:59.740
There's another set of cameras
called Dodger Vision.


274
00:16:00.615 --> 00:16:04.365
Dodger Vision is what you see
on the big video screens at the stadium.


275
00:16:04.448 --> 00:16:06.156
Our in-house filming.

276
00:16:06.781 --> 00:16:09.656
I painstakingly
went through the videos,


277
00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:13.781
trying to find Juan among 40,000 people.

278
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.781
A staggering number, yes.

279
00:16:18.656 --> 00:16:20.198
Since I knew where Juan was,

280
00:16:20.281 --> 00:16:23.490
it was very easy to see the block of seats
and count the rows down.


281
00:16:24.198 --> 00:16:27.365
Every time a right-handed batter
came up to bat,


282
00:16:27.448 --> 00:16:31.156
I was looking for Juan or his friends
in the background.


283
00:16:31.906 --> 00:16:34.448
I felt that I was getting framed.

284
00:16:34.531 --> 00:16:39.073
I know you hear these stories
of people being exonerated


285
00:16:39.156 --> 00:16:41.781
25, 30 years later.

286
00:16:42.865 --> 00:16:46.406
And that would play in my head
over and over and over.


287
00:16:47.531 --> 00:16:50.031
I was putting everything
on super slo-mo.


288
00:16:50.115 --> 00:16:53.698
It took me an entire day
to go through a three-hour game,


289
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:56.198
because I could not afford
to miss anything.


290
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.406
I was able to find Juan
sitting in those seats.


291
00:17:09.698 --> 00:17:11.948
But the resolution wasn't high enough.

292
00:17:14.073 --> 00:17:15.948
Talking to the kids
was really tough,


293
00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:18.573
because they wanted to know
when I was coming home.


294
00:17:19.073 --> 00:17:20.573
And I didn't have an answer.

295
00:17:21.906 --> 00:17:24.781
Did I explain to you
that we have to tell the truth in court?


296
00:17:24.865 --> 00:17:26.865
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah.


297
00:17:26.948 --> 00:17:29.448
And if I told you
that this pen was blue,


298
00:17:29.531 --> 00:17:31.573
would that be the truth or a lie?

299
00:17:31.656 --> 00:17:32.781
A lie.

300
00:17:32.865 --> 00:17:35.531
And if I told you
that this microphone was white,


301
00:17:35.615 --> 00:17:37.448
would that be the truth or a lie?

302
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:39.115
A lie.

303
00:17:39.198 --> 00:17:42.115
You promise to tell us
the truth from what you remember?


304
00:17:42.198 --> 00:17:43.156
Yeah.

305
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.281
Did you go to a Dodger game
with your daddy?


306
00:17:45.365 --> 00:17:47.073
- Yeah.
- This year, last year?


307
00:17:47.656 --> 00:17:48.698
Yeah.

308
00:17:48.781 --> 00:17:51.156
Did your daddy buy you
anything during the game?


309
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.865
- Yeah.
- What did he buy you?


310
00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:55.698
Um...

311
00:17:56.698 --> 00:17:57.531
Oh...

312
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:00.115
Ice cream.

313
00:18:00.781 --> 00:18:03.573
And, um... candy.

314
00:18:04.698 --> 00:18:06.490
And, um...

315
00:18:08.448 --> 00:18:12.573
and some Dodgers... um... cards.

316
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.281
Some Dodger cards?

317
00:18:14.365 --> 00:18:16.948
Where did he buy the Dodger cards,
do you remember?


318
00:18:17.698 --> 00:18:21.865
If Juan had the alibi,
the Dodger game, why didn't he mention it


319
00:18:21.948 --> 00:18:24.198
when the police were interviewing him
the night he was arrested?


320
00:18:24.281 --> 00:18:25.823
You would have to ask him that.

321
00:18:26.656 --> 00:18:28.406
What were you doing on the 12th?

322
00:18:30.323 --> 00:18:31.865
Well, I'm going to remember,

323
00:18:31.948 --> 00:18:34.948
and that's hopefully going to clear me up,
dude.


324
00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:41.448
You know, these guys are telling me
that I killed some 16-year-old girl.


325
00:18:41.531 --> 00:18:43.073
Like, the date was...

326
00:18:43.781 --> 00:18:47.990
Like...
It was irrelevant to me at that point.


327
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:53.948
I asked Juan
some details about the game.


328
00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:59.323
Juan has a fantastic ability
to recall games, plays, details...


329
00:18:59.406 --> 00:19:02.615
He says, "I think they may have been
filming something there."


330
00:19:02.698 --> 00:19:04.948
I've been
to hundreds of Dodger games,


331
00:19:05.031 --> 00:19:07.948
and never have I seen them
film anything there.


332
00:19:08.448 --> 00:19:11.781
And this particular day, they were there.

333
00:19:12.573 --> 00:19:16.531
All he remembered were
security personnel blocking the aisle


334
00:19:16.615 --> 00:19:18.990
and this man walking
up and down the stairs


335
00:19:19.115 --> 00:19:20.615
for the different takes.

336
00:19:23.448 --> 00:19:25.198
So I went back to Dodger Stadium,

337
00:19:25.281 --> 00:19:28.865
walked with Sam
to the Media Relations Department.


338
00:19:28.948 --> 00:19:31.948
The person that was there
pulled out this big calendar book.


339
00:19:32.906 --> 00:19:35.823
I watched her start flipping.
April, May...


340
00:19:35.906 --> 00:19:37.531
And all these pages are blank.

341
00:19:38.365 --> 00:19:39.573
She turns to May 12th,

342
00:19:39.656 --> 00:19:42.990
and damn if there isn't an entry
on May 12th.


343
00:19:43.198 --> 00:19:46.240
It had some kind of obscure
production company name,


344
00:19:46.406 --> 00:19:48.948
I didn't recognize it,
but it had a phone number.


345
00:19:49.365 --> 00:19:52.448
I called it up, and they answered, "HBO."

346
00:19:52.823 --> 00:19:57.323
I get a cold call from a guy,
"This is Todd Melnik, I'm a lawyer,"


347
00:19:57.406 --> 00:19:59.906
and he tells me this crazy story.

348
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:04.073
He says, "Well, we don't usually release
any pre-production footage.


349
00:20:04.156 --> 00:20:07.906
You'll have to wait until it airs."

350
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.490
My first thought is, "This guy's nuts."

351
00:20:10.573 --> 00:20:13.948
And secondly,
"There's 56,000 people at this game.


352
00:20:14.031 --> 00:20:15.781
How could this guy possibly be on camera?"

353
00:20:15.865 --> 00:20:17.281
I said, "I need to find anything.

354
00:20:17.365 --> 00:20:20.906
I need to place my client
at Dodger Stadium on that night."


355
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:22.531
In the meantime, 
I talked to Larry,

356
00:20:22.615 --> 00:20:26.198
and I'm like, "Larry, there's this guy
that says, you know, his guy's in jail,


357
00:20:26.281 --> 00:20:29.406
and he's a lawyer and...
they remember camera crews being there,


358
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:30.448
and they think it's us."

359
00:20:31.031 --> 00:20:32.365
Uh... What's that song?

360
00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:34.573
What is that song?

361
00:20:44.365 --> 00:20:47.198
Curb Your Enthusiasm
was a comedy that was on HBO.


362
00:20:47.281 --> 00:20:49.323
Starred Larry David,
the creator of Seinfeld.


363
00:20:49.906 --> 00:20:52.781
At the time, the name Larry David
didn't ring a bell to me.


364
00:20:53.906 --> 00:20:58.240
I had no idea that he was
this mega-huge Hollywood star.


365
00:20:58.323 --> 00:21:02.156
He's right, of course, in referring to me
as a mega-huge star.


366
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.448
That's totally accurate about me.

367
00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:06.323
So he said,
"Okay, when can you come down?"


368
00:21:06.406 --> 00:21:08.406
I said, "Tomorrow?"
He says, "Okay, tomorrow."


369
00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.698
Just hearing
that he was going to go down there


370
00:21:11.781 --> 00:21:14.531
and see this, you know, these outtakes,

371
00:21:14.615 --> 00:21:17.615
it just lifted my spirits instantly.

372
00:21:18.198 --> 00:21:20.281
This episode was called
"The Carpool Lane."


373
00:21:20.365 --> 00:21:23.323
It was the seventh episode of season four.

374
00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:27.198
You should see the traffic.
The only thing moving is the carpool lane.


375
00:21:27.281 --> 00:21:29.073
I'll never make it. 
I'm going home.

376
00:21:29.156 --> 00:21:31.656
The episode was that I picked up a hooker
in the carpool lane


377
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:32.990
and took her to Dodger Stadium.

378
00:21:33.781 --> 00:21:36.323
Hey, Daddy.
You want a date with Momma?


379
00:21:36.865 --> 00:21:40.448
Monena. I got a red snapper
that'll talk to you, Daddy.


380
00:21:45.865 --> 00:21:46.781
Get in the car.

381
00:21:47.281 --> 00:21:49.448
I'd never seen the show,
heard of the show,


382
00:21:49.531 --> 00:21:52.698
I didn't have HBO, so I didn't have
any exposure to the show.


383
00:21:53.531 --> 00:21:54.823
I was a runner, I was a PA.

384
00:21:54.906 --> 00:21:57.073
You know, "Go deliver this here,
go pick this up,


385
00:21:57.156 --> 00:21:58.990
bring it back to the office,"
sort of thing.


386
00:21:59.073 --> 00:22:01.323
So I had no clue
what I was getting into.

387
00:22:01.406 --> 00:22:03.906
I knew that we were going to have to find
a baseball stadium


388
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:06.198
and fill it with thousands of extras,

389
00:22:06.281 --> 00:22:08.948
and, of course, he wanted to do
the Dodgers, since it's L.A.


390
00:22:09.031 --> 00:22:11.865
That right there
was a huge uh-oh.


391
00:22:11.948 --> 00:22:14.740
We are part of the entertainment
community in Los Angeles,


392
00:22:14.823 --> 00:22:16.365
and we do want to cooperate.

393
00:22:16.448 --> 00:22:19.323
They came back and said,
"All right, here's what we could do."


394
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:23.906
We showed up, I believe it was
in the late afternoon,


395
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.073
four or five o'clock was the call time.

396
00:22:26.156 --> 00:22:27.781
Now, I didn't understand, I was like,

397
00:22:27.865 --> 00:22:30.323
"How are we going to shoot
at a real game? This is crazy."


398
00:22:30.406 --> 00:22:32.198
I know the seats
ain't way the fuck up here.


399
00:22:32.281 --> 00:22:33.490
Got a problem with the seats?

400
00:22:33.573 --> 00:22:36.031
You said we had good seats,
club seats and shit.


401
00:22:36.115 --> 00:22:37.948
We shot in two sections.

402
00:22:38.031 --> 00:22:40.490
I don't know if they call it
a grandstand at Dodger Stadium,


403
00:22:40.573 --> 00:22:41.406
the upper deck...

404
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.865
It's very arbitrary, where we were placed.

405
00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:47.365
I never saw the cameras
at the Dodger game.


406
00:22:47.448 --> 00:22:49.573
I don't know if people
even knew people were filming.


407
00:22:50.448 --> 00:22:53.490
We had a very, very long lens.

408
00:22:53.573 --> 00:22:56.115
The whole thing was
we needed to be almost invisible.


409
00:22:56.198 --> 00:23:00.198
I had to be in bad seats
and then see Bob Einstein.


410
00:23:00.281 --> 00:23:02.615
He played Marty Funkhouser on the show.

411
00:23:03.406 --> 00:23:05.531
So I went
to the Curb Your Enthusiasm studios


412
00:23:05.615 --> 00:23:06.531
in Santa Monica,

413
00:23:06.615 --> 00:23:08.781
and I get put into an editing bay.

414
00:23:08.865 --> 00:23:12.615
They had an engineer that was putting in
these beta tapes one by one


415
00:23:12.698 --> 00:23:14.115
and playing them for me.

416
00:23:20.781 --> 00:23:23.240
I just remember it being chaos,
to be honest with you.


417
00:23:23.323 --> 00:23:25.281
You've got two or three people

418
00:23:26.448 --> 00:23:28.531
trying to hold back thousands of people.

419
00:23:29.448 --> 00:23:33.198
Midway through the game, my daughter
asked me for, I don't remember,


420
00:23:33.281 --> 00:23:35.656
ice cream, popcorn, candy, something...

421
00:23:36.365 --> 00:23:37.906
There was about eight tapes

422
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.906
and we're putting in
tape after tape after tape.


423
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.448
We went up to the concessions stands,
and I bought her what she wanted.


424
00:23:44.573 --> 00:23:46.198
We start to roll the scenes

425
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:48.948
and, you know,
there's some shots of Bob Einstein.


426
00:23:49.031 --> 00:23:52.698
- Hey, Larry, I see you got a ticket!
- Yeah, the seats really stink though.


427
00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:58.240
When I got back, there was
a camera crew right on our aisle.


428
00:23:58.323 --> 00:24:01.531
We weren't supposed to stop
people walking up and down the aisle,


429
00:24:01.615 --> 00:24:05.281
but if they didn't want to be on camera,
we would say, "Can you wait one minute?"


430
00:24:05.365 --> 00:24:06.865
- Can I join you?
- No.


431
00:24:07.448 --> 00:24:08.281
Why not?

432
00:24:08.365 --> 00:24:12.365
I grabbed my daughter's hand
and I tried to walk down the stairs,


433
00:24:12.448 --> 00:24:13.281
but I was stopped.

434
00:24:13.365 --> 00:24:15.615
- You won't let me sit there?!
- Not even for a minute!


435
00:24:15.698 --> 00:24:19.531
These are paying customers.
We can't hold them for too long.


436
00:24:19.948 --> 00:24:22.073
There's only about
maybe six minutes a tape


437
00:24:22.156 --> 00:24:23.323
on each of these beta tapes,

438
00:24:23.406 --> 00:24:25.781
and we're already
on tape number five or six.


439
00:24:25.865 --> 00:24:27.615
And I'm getting disheartened.

440
00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:30.031
Oh no!

441
00:24:30.656 --> 00:24:33.281
The same guy who stopped me,
he looked over at me,


442
00:24:33.365 --> 00:24:36.781
and then he was just like,
"Hey, you know what? Just go ahead."


443
00:24:37.906 --> 00:24:39.490
And nobody was being let in.

444
00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:41.406
Thanks.

445
00:24:41.656 --> 00:24:44.365
I probably didn't even know
we were rolling the camera.


446
00:24:44.448 --> 00:24:48.990
And if I did, I was probably a shitty PA
and let them through anyway.


447
00:25:19.948 --> 00:25:24.031
- I literally jumped out of my chair.
- He literally sprung out of his chair.


448
00:25:24.115 --> 00:25:25.490
And there was this gasp.

449
00:25:26.573 --> 00:25:27.781
And there he was.

450
00:25:28.406 --> 00:25:29.406
Pretty cool!

451
00:25:32.115 --> 00:25:33.531
Is that them right there?

452
00:25:39.198 --> 00:25:40.198
Wow.

453
00:25:48.156 --> 00:25:50.448
We roll it back,
confirm yes, it is him,

454
00:25:50.531 --> 00:25:52.281
we keep playing the tape,

455
00:25:52.865 --> 00:25:54.823
and he's on two more cassettes.

456
00:25:56.531 --> 00:25:58.615
I thought, "Wow, this is fantastic,

457
00:25:58.698 --> 00:26:01.865
I'm going to be able to prove
that he was at the game."


458
00:26:03.115 --> 00:26:05.865
I said, "Todd, what happened?"

459
00:26:06.365 --> 00:26:10.323
And he said, "Dude, you're on the tape."

460
00:26:10.406 --> 00:26:13.823
And I was just like...
I think I let the phone go.


461
00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:15.365
I think I let the phone go.

462
00:26:15.448 --> 00:26:19.115
Then I asked him about,
"When was this shot?


463
00:26:19.198 --> 00:26:22.323
Do you guys know
what time of the game this was shot?"


464
00:26:22.406 --> 00:26:26.073
We shoot with time code,
which is time of day.


465
00:26:26.156 --> 00:26:29.990
The stamp that's put on the video tape
that you can't see, it's electronic.


466
00:26:30.073 --> 00:26:32.781
So we knew exactly what time
he was being shot at.


467
00:26:32.865 --> 00:26:36.948
The first scene was at 8:55,
the last scene was at 9:15.


468
00:26:38.281 --> 00:26:41.656
Of course, it was really... It was
pretty exciting, to tell you the truth.


469
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:46.448
I looked at this video as being
the holy grail of Juan's defense.


470
00:26:48.198 --> 00:26:51.823
Except the murder took place at 10:32.

471
00:26:52.906 --> 00:26:53.781
Crap.

472
00:26:55.323 --> 00:26:57.698
What else do we need? You know?

473
00:26:57.781 --> 00:27:01.865
I'm on the video the day
they're saying that I killed this girl.


474
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.740
Isn't that enough?

475
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:09.156
At 10:43 at night,

476
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.365
our defendant, by his own evidence,
his own witnesses,


477
00:27:12.448 --> 00:27:17.948
is on the same street as our victim,
dropping off his cousin, Miguel Catalan,


478
00:27:18.031 --> 00:27:21.948
about 100 to 150 yards away
from the murder scene,


479
00:27:22.031 --> 00:27:23.240
at the time of the murder.

480
00:27:23.323 --> 00:27:26.490
So the HBO tape,
in your opinion, is good only for what?


481
00:27:27.281 --> 00:27:28.281
Nothing.

482
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.198
So the prosecution is gonna contend
that you could have left early


483
00:27:32.906 --> 00:27:35.156
and had time to go
and commit that murder.


484
00:27:35.823 --> 00:27:39.615
And... dude,
that just brought me back down.


485
00:27:42.865 --> 00:27:44.990
I said,
"I've got to figure out a way


486
00:27:45.073 --> 00:27:47.781
to place you
at Dodger Stadium even longer."


487
00:27:48.781 --> 00:27:50.281
Did you buy something there?

488
00:27:50.365 --> 00:27:52.240
And I'm like,
"Yes, I bought a lot of things."


489
00:27:52.323 --> 00:27:54.906
He goes, "Did you use a credit card?"
I'm like, "No."


490
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:56.823
Then we started talking about cell phones.

491
00:27:58.365 --> 00:28:01.781
There's a call at 10:11 in the evening,

492
00:28:01.865 --> 00:28:03.990
for 49 seconds, an inbound call.

493
00:28:04.365 --> 00:28:07.073
- Whose phone number is that?
- My friend.


494
00:28:07.573 --> 00:28:09.448
And did you call Juan
from her phone?


495
00:28:09.531 --> 00:28:10.573
Yes, I did.

496
00:28:11.573 --> 00:28:14.406
I kept calling Juan and calling Juan,
and I'm like, "Is the game over?"


497
00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:16.948
I said, "We're walking out of the stadium
right now."


498
00:28:17.031 --> 00:28:19.948
And that was maybe about 10:10,
I want to say.


499
00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:22.406
- Do you recognize that number?
- That's my number.


500
00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.115
But I don't remember
if he called me or I called him.


501
00:28:25.198 --> 00:28:28.115
You have to remember
every little detail of your life.


502
00:28:28.198 --> 00:28:30.406
You always think
it may not happen to you, but...


503
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.240
Only in the movies, only on TV...

504
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.115
I knew, from being involved
as a commentator


505
00:28:37.198 --> 00:28:38.698
on the O.J. Simpson case,

506
00:28:38.781 --> 00:28:41.031
when he was doing his slow-speed chase,

507
00:28:41.115 --> 00:28:44.073
that the police were able to find out
which cell towers


508
00:28:44.156 --> 00:28:47.906
were pinging off of his cell phone
when the call was transmitted.


509
00:28:48.656 --> 00:28:49.906
That's how they found him.

510
00:28:51.198 --> 00:28:56.573
The very first phone call I got from Todd
was after the subpoena was released.


511
00:28:57.865 --> 00:29:00.490
We basically released
phone records, wire taps


512
00:29:00.573 --> 00:29:04.031
for, you know, law enforcement agencies,
and different types of entities.


513
00:29:04.865 --> 00:29:08.823
And I just happened to get that case
just by the luck of the draw, you know.


514
00:29:08.906 --> 00:29:11.156
What's the first number
that you recognize?


515
00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.073
Mine.

516
00:29:12.156 --> 00:29:13.698
Due to the nature of the case,

517
00:29:13.781 --> 00:29:15.823
Todd was very, very persistent.

518
00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.281
It was one of those situations
where it had to go above and beyond


519
00:29:20.365 --> 00:29:22.156
because we had the ability to see

520
00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:25.823
what cell tower the actual phone calls
were pinging off of.


521
00:29:25.906 --> 00:29:29.323
It's going to show exactly where
a person is at a certain time period.


522
00:29:32.906 --> 00:29:34.531
The cell tower Juan had used

523
00:29:34.615 --> 00:29:37.448
was right across the street
from Dodger Stadium,


524
00:29:37.531 --> 00:29:40.823
and the radius
for that particular one is a mile.


525
00:29:41.865 --> 00:29:46.656
So I knew Juan was at Dodger Stadium
at at least 10:12.


526
00:29:47.365 --> 00:29:51.740
Which cell tower was used
to receive that call at 10:11 at night?


527
00:29:52.406 --> 00:29:57.823
10:11 at night,
the cell site was NCA 6581...


528
00:29:57.906 --> 00:30:03.698
Rather than giving me a diagram
of whose phone number was whose,


529
00:30:03.781 --> 00:30:07.948
I was listening to numbers,
trying to record numbers and times,


530
00:30:08.031 --> 00:30:11.573
and I was really befuddled.

531
00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.781
All I knew about the case

532
00:30:14.865 --> 00:30:19.198
was the defendant was
possibly looking at a death sentence


533
00:30:19.281 --> 00:30:21.490
if he were ultimately convicted.

534
00:30:22.156 --> 00:30:26.740
And that frightened me... beyond words.

535
00:30:29.865 --> 00:30:31.531
In a preliminary hearing,

536
00:30:31.615 --> 00:30:35.823
am I going to send this person
on to a jury trial,


537
00:30:35.906 --> 00:30:38.781
or am I going to make the decision
to dismiss it?


538
00:30:39.281 --> 00:30:42.990
I was always aware
of the pressure of time.


539
00:30:43.656 --> 00:30:46.531
I would go into the court
with Todd, sit down...


540
00:30:47.031 --> 00:30:52.281
Ten, fifteen minutes max, they would talk
back and forth in lawyer jargon


541
00:30:52.365 --> 00:30:55.198
and stuff I didn't know
what they were talking about.


542
00:30:57.406 --> 00:31:02.365
Okay, see you next date, and next date,
and on, it went like that.


543
00:31:03.615 --> 00:31:05.698
I agreed, to save time,

544
00:31:05.781 --> 00:31:10.781
that I would take
the interrogation audio tape home with me.


545
00:31:11.781 --> 00:31:15.115
I knew that I could listen to it
as many times as I wanted to,


546
00:31:15.906 --> 00:31:16.990
which I did.

547
00:31:17.615 --> 00:31:20.115
You guys are making
the biggest mistake.


548
00:31:20.698 --> 00:31:23.448
This night, you made
the biggest mistake of your life.


549
00:31:23.531 --> 00:31:25.198
No. No.

550
00:31:25.281 --> 00:31:27.281
You guys are going to remember this,

551
00:31:27.365 --> 00:31:31.198
because you guys are trying to pin
somebody that had nothing to do with this.


552
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.406
I listened to that tape
over and over and over again.


553
00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.490
I made my children listen to it.

554
00:31:38.323 --> 00:31:42.323
And I kept asking them,
as I was really asking myself,


555
00:31:42.406 --> 00:31:45.198
"Is this the voice of a guilty man?"

556
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:55.323
I was waiting for Todd
to come in to brief me.


557
00:31:56.073 --> 00:31:59.823
I remember, he told me that,
as soon as I walked in that door,


558
00:32:00.448 --> 00:32:04.240
not to look over to the audience side,
which was on the left side.


559
00:32:05.198 --> 00:32:08.531
Martha's family was in the seats.

560
00:32:10.781 --> 00:32:14.781
I remember being anguished
by this case.


561
00:32:15.406 --> 00:32:17.115
I couldn't get it out of my mind.

562
00:32:18.365 --> 00:32:19.823
And I vacillated,

563
00:32:21.823 --> 00:32:24.240
trying to determine
how I was going to rule.


564
00:32:25.531 --> 00:32:28.448
Martha Puebla was at stake for me.

565
00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:31.531
This man
would be facing the death penalty


566
00:32:31.615 --> 00:32:33.615
if he hadn't, by the grace of God,

567
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:36.281
gotten Dodger tickets
from someone the day before


568
00:32:36.365 --> 00:32:37.906
and invited these people,

569
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:41.615
got caught on video from that HBO show...

570
00:32:41.698 --> 00:32:45.656
You heard the tape of the interview
with Detective Pinner.


571
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.198
It is clearly a one-witness ID case.

572
00:32:49.281 --> 00:32:53.240
However, the one witness in this case
is extremely credible,


573
00:32:54.115 --> 00:32:55.948
has no motive to lie,

574
00:32:56.406 --> 00:33:00.573
and made a composite drawing
with a composite artist


575
00:33:00.656 --> 00:33:04.656
that is strikingly similar
to the defendant's appearance.


576
00:33:05.365 --> 00:33:11.323
I don't have any doubt that eyewitness
attempted to be credible,


577
00:33:11.406 --> 00:33:14.990
but he observed this murder
on a darkened residential street


578
00:33:15.073 --> 00:33:18.031
under obviously the most traumatic
of circumstances.


579
00:33:18.115 --> 00:33:21.115
She started talking and talking,

580
00:33:21.198 --> 00:33:22.448
and talking...

581
00:33:22.906 --> 00:33:25.865
And I didn't understand one word she said.

582
00:33:25.948 --> 00:33:30.406
Todd's sitting to my left,
and he leans over.


583
00:33:31.615 --> 00:33:33.990
And then he says, "It's over."

584
00:33:36.573 --> 00:33:37.906
And I said, "What?"

585
00:33:38.865 --> 00:33:40.573
And then...

586
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.115
- We're gonna get in trouble!
- Oh, my God!


587
00:33:49.948 --> 00:33:52.323
Go over and give your daddy a hug!

588
00:34:05.323 --> 00:34:06.448
Hi!

589
00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:13.240
Everything's over.

590
00:34:17.865 --> 00:34:18.906
Sorry, Todd.

591
00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:20.990
- Thank you, Todd.
- You're welcome, man.


592
00:34:23.365 --> 00:34:25.240
- I owe you, dude.
- It's all right.


593
00:34:25.906 --> 00:34:27.115
You owe him your life!

594
00:34:27.198 --> 00:34:28.448
- I owe you.
- All right.


595
00:34:29.906 --> 00:34:32.281
Todd gave me
one last hug and just...


596
00:34:33.906 --> 00:34:36.865
It seemed like he just rode off
into the sunset, like a...


597
00:34:38.323 --> 00:34:39.323
As he should.

598
00:34:39.406 --> 00:34:43.573
And, you know, left me there
with my family and...


599
00:34:44.323 --> 00:34:46.281
I got into the car and they said...

600
00:34:46.948 --> 00:34:50.990
You know, they were all super excited
and happy, as I was,


601
00:34:51.073 --> 00:34:53.490
and they're like,
"Okay, okay, what do you want?


602
00:34:53.573 --> 00:34:55.198
We'll buy you whatever."

603
00:34:55.281 --> 00:34:57.656
And I was like, "All I want...

604
00:34:58.156 --> 00:35:00.115
All I want, honestly,

605
00:35:00.656 --> 00:35:01.740
is a Coke.

606
00:35:01.823 --> 00:35:02.740
I didn't have...

607
00:35:03.156 --> 00:35:05.740
You have no soda,
no nothing in there, dude.


608
00:35:05.823 --> 00:35:07.906
All I wanted was a Coke, that's all.

609
00:35:10.281 --> 00:35:12.698
Do you know
what incriminating evidence is?


610
00:35:12.781 --> 00:35:13.656
- Yes.
- All right.


611
00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:16.115
Were you asking Mr. 
Catalan questions

612
00:35:16.198 --> 00:35:20.656
to try to obtain
an incriminating response?


613
00:35:23.281 --> 00:35:24.323
Yes.

614
00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:36.323
Did you try to trick
Juan Catalan after he was arrested,


615
00:35:36.573 --> 00:35:39.990
with the circle around his picture?

616
00:35:42.031 --> 00:35:43.031
Yes, sir.

617
00:35:43.115 --> 00:35:46.073
That was...
dishonest, right?


618
00:35:58.698 --> 00:36:00.198
We're going to begin

619
00:36:00.281 --> 00:36:03.323
with the United States attorney,
Deborah Wong Yang.


620
00:36:03.406 --> 00:36:06.490
The indictment alleges
that several members of the gang


621
00:36:06.573 --> 00:36:09.073
murdered a 16-year-old girl,

622
00:36:09.156 --> 00:36:12.240
who had witnessed
the gang's wrongdoings


623
00:36:12.323 --> 00:36:13.990
and was cooperating with police.

624
00:36:23.073 --> 00:36:26.198
Maybe, I don't know, every few years,

625
00:36:26.281 --> 00:36:29.740
somebody will bring it up or something,
and I'll tell the story.


626
00:36:29.823 --> 00:36:33.740
Maybe I'll tell it at a party,
how I got a guy off of a murder.


627
00:36:33.823 --> 00:36:35.365
You know, um...

628
00:36:35.865 --> 00:36:38.365
Impress a date with it, I don't know.

629
00:36:44.281 --> 00:36:46.948
♪ Take me out
to the ball game ♪

630
00:36:47.031 --> 00:36:50.156
♪ Take me out to the crowd ♪

631
00:36:51.073 --> 00:36:54.490
♪ Buy me some peanuts and crackerjacks ♪

632
00:36:55.323 --> 00:36:57.781
♪ I don’t care if
I never get back ♪

633
00:36:57.865 --> 00:37:00.406
The thing that keeps repeating
in my head, over and over


634
00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:01.698
and over and over,

635
00:37:01.781 --> 00:37:06.865
is imagine he would have stayed home
to watch that game.


636
00:37:06.948 --> 00:37:09.698
Who were they going to believe?
His mom? Me?


637
00:37:10.948 --> 00:37:13.073
My daughter? "Oh, my daddy was here."

638
00:37:13.156 --> 00:37:14.656
How, how do you prove...

639
00:37:15.406 --> 00:37:16.823
It's just crazy.

640
00:37:26.156 --> 00:37:27.865
It's a dangerous thing to do,

641
00:37:27.948 --> 00:37:31.740
to go around viewing life
from the "What if?" perspective.


642
00:37:33.073 --> 00:37:35.656
What if we hadn't done
the deal with Larry David?


643
00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:39.406
What if the camera crew hadn't gone
to that aisle on the field double?


644
00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:44.073
What if his daughter had decided
that she didn't want to go to the game?


645
00:37:44.906 --> 00:37:46.740
What if he hadn't made the phone call?

646
00:37:47.656 --> 00:37:49.115
What if, what if, what if...

647
00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.448
All of life is "What if?"

648
00:37:53.531 --> 00:37:55.948
The next couple of
minutes is a "What if?"

649
00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:03.240
...you can now be sure
that we're gonna see John Smoltz.
