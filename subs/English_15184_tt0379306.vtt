1
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.840
When I was going through
my wardrobe


2
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.880
I found an extra hairpin
on the floor


3
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.800
That's nothing, I found
her hair in my bed.


4
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.080
Just another tragedy of
a down-and-out, I guess


5
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.360
For I'm selling
the thing


6
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.520
That means everything
to my life...


7
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.880
Some women
bring happiness...


8
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.360
wherever they go.
Others, whenever they go.


9
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.120
I do both.

10
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.440
Husbands like to
see me come...


11
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.880
wives prefer to see
me go.


12
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.360
There she is.
That's her.


13
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.560
Whose husband didn't she
sleep with?


14
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.600
- Who's she with now?
- Who knows.


15
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.600
- She's older than I thought.
- Look. Watch.


16
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.040
This will teach her.

17
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.960
I'm sorry, Mrs Erlynne, but
that account was closed.


18
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.400
By Mrs Fairchild.

19
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.240
I wish you'd told me before
I ordered the Bordeaux.


20
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.880
What Bordeaux, Mrs Erlynne?

21
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.600
Joe, you're my kind of guy.

22
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.920
- Is she behind me?
- In the blue.


23
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.080
Charge it to Senator Kleghorn.

24
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.920
That's Mrs Kleghorn sitting
next to Mrs Fairchild.


25
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.160
- What a small world.
- And Mrs Winters on her right.


26
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.880
And getting smaller.

27
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.920
You wanna go out
the back?


28
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.880
No, if you go out the back, you'll
never come in the front, Joe.


29
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.400
A lady always leaves the
way she came.


30
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.240
I thought my husband
had more taste.


31
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.400
So sorry to hear you're
leaving us, Mrs Erlynne.


32
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.080
- I'm leaving you?
- I'll prepare your bill.


33
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.640
I ask you to
make me an offer


34
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.520
I don't know how much
it will bring


35
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.600
It isn't a lot...

36
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.040
but it's all I've got

37
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.200
Pooled by an old
gold ring?


38
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.040
It's known me as poor
as a beggar


39
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.480
And it's known me as
rich as a king


40
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.400
And it's known me in hell
And in heaven as well


41
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.280
Pooled by an
old gold ring?


42
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.440
My sudden change
in circumstance...


43
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.960
was not the only reason
for my departure.


44
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.960
The italian coast in summer
attracts the rich and famous.


45
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.000
I'm infamous and poor.

46
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.000
Close enough.

47
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.560
One door closes,
another opens.


48
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.480
Sometimes that door is
not the one you expect.


49
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.640
I saw my chance and
decided to take it.


50
00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.920
Meg, dear. Come along.
Come along.


51
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.120
Ah, Giuseppina.

52
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.400
She's my friend.
Give her a discount.


53
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.120
Come here.

54
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.800
It's the best glove shop in the city.

55
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.480
She'll give you a good discount.

56
00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.080
You go along, I'll find your
husband, don't worry.


57
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.440
This way, madam.

58
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.880
These are pretty.

59
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.960
- Your hand looks about right.
- I beg your pardon?


60
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.840
My little sister. She was
adamant about every detail but...


61
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.520
neglected to tell me the size.
Would you mind?


62
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.400
Oh, no, of course not.

63
00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.720
It's always a little snug
the first time.


64
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.800
Maybe you should take
off your ring.


65
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.000
It's my wedding ring,
I never take it off.


66
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.440
The other hand, then.

67
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.440
No need to button it. You can see
it fits perfectly.


68
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.560
Lord Darlington,
you depraved man.


69
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.280
What have you been up to?

70
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.600
Ignore him, Meg, dear.
He's a great sinner.


71
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.200
But an excellent bridge partner.

72
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.480
Or I would never tolerate him.

73
00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.880
- Do you know each other?
- The year I spent in the London office.


74
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.920
I told you about John.
But you've met.


75
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.320
- No. It's nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure, Mrs Windemere.


76
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.640
Your wife was helping me select
gloves for my mother.


77
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.280
- Your sister, you said.
- Either one.


78
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.800
We should have dinner.
Where are you staying?


79
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.400
The Grand, but we're trying
to find a villa.


80
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.560
So late in the season.
I warned you.


81
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.200
I know one that's available.

82
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.000
Isn't it an election year in
the wild west?


83
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.440
Who says I'm running?

84
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.960
- It's perfect. It's beaultiful.
- Did I mention the ghost?


85
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.080
I feel like a princess
in a fairly tale.


86
00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.640
You are a princess.

87
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.760
That's because I
married the prince.


88
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.360
I have her completely fooled,
poor girl.


89
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.520
If I could fool a woman as
pretty, I wouldn't be a bachelor.


90
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.520
- Now you've made her blush.
- Don't be silly.


91
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.400
Come and see the paintings.

92
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.040
Come on.

93
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.200
Good evening.

94
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.760
Lady Plymdale?

95
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.440
Oh, is she the one
with the big...


96
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:09.520
Feet. Enourmous feet.
Poor old Plymdale.


97
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.960
- Ace, Queen, King, Jack.
- No honours.


98
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.400
No, no, John's yacht,
John's rules.


99
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.720
- Have it.
- Thank you.


100
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.720
Huge feet. Pontoons.

101
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.360
If desire had an antidote, it would
be those pontoons of hers.


102
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.320
I grow ill thinking of then.

103
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.560
How many times have you
been divorced, Tuppy?


104
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.160
- Three, four? I've simply lost count.
- That's bigamy.


105
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.280
Bigamy is having one wife
too many.


106
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.920
So is monogamy

107
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.120
One should always have a proper
basis for marriage. A mutual...


108
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.840
- Misunderstanding?
- Exactly.


109
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.200
A man can't be happy
with one woman.


110
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.280
A man can be happy with any woman.
As long as he doesn't love her.


111
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:43.880
For a man who's never thought
of getting married...


112
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.840
you seem to know an awful
lot about it.


113
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.360
I've thought very seriously of marrying.
That's why I'm still single.


114
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:49.680
Hear, hear.

115
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.080
I just haven't met the right woman.
Look at Cecil, still with Edna.


116
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.400
One keeps one's eyes wide open
before the wedding...


117
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.040
and half shut after.

118
00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.160
- That's all there is to it.
- Exactly.


119
00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.840
I fancy raising the stakes.

120
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.440
Oh, lucky blighter!

121
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.720
You don't look as if
you're enjoying yourself.


122
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.880
Oh, I am. It's a very
nice party.


123
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.560
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, thank you. I don't drink.


124
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.200
You don't drink?

125
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:33.720
- Do I seem like a prig?
- No, of course not.


126
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:37.360
- It's the way I was raised.
- In a convent?


127
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.640
By my Aunt Julia.
My father's sister.


128
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:44.440
My mother died when I
was very little.


129
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.560
It's the only picture I
have of her.


130
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.440
My father never remarried.

131
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.880
She's every bit as beaultiful
as her daughter.


132
00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.080
Have I offended you?
I meant it as a compliment.


133
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:03.360
- You pay me too many compliments.
- I'll stop at once.


134
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.520
- Thank you.
- Just so you know, I meant every one.


135
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.600
You pretend to be bad, but...

136
00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.640
- you're not really.
- There is no good or bad.


137
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.200
People are either charming
or tedious.


138
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.560
If I've been the latter,
I sincerely apologize.


139
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.400
- I'd like us to become friends.
- We already are, aren't we?


140
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.600
Not if you keep flattering me and
paying me silly compliments.


141
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.360
Define silly.

142
00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.720
I want your word.

143
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.920
I find the best way to keep my
word is never to give it.


144
00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.520
It's always a pleasure
to see a pretty woman.


145
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.400
Good day.

146
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.760
It has to be something
really special...


147
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.160
My wife's birthday.

148
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.720
This is a very special
object.


149
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.600
What do you think?

150
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.880
The sapphire matches your eyes.

151
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.440
It's for my wife.

152
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.560
A man should never buy his
wife jewellery.


153
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.280
And why is that?

154
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:47.160
It makes her wonder what
he bought his mistress.


155
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.440
My wife has nothing to
wonder about.


156
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.600
She's a lucky woman.

157
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.560
If I was your wife...

158
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.520
- this is what I'd want.
- A fan?


159
00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:01.720
Not for stirring the air,
for stirring the heart.


160
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.960
For centuries...

161
00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.520
an erotic language between
men an women.


162
00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:13.000
If a woman placed it on her breast
like this, it meant "I love you".


163
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
"When can I see you?"

164
00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.200
"Wait for me."

165
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.040
"You may kiss me."

166
00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.200
"We're being watched."

167
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.640
I'm sold.

168
00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.640
How much?

169
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.680
No, it's not for sale.

170
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.640
Not for sale.

171
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.840
It would break my
mom's heart.


172
00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.560
My mama.

173
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.840
Real gold.

174
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:01.520
If you give him everything, who's
going to buy me an espresso?


175
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.080
My back.

176
00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.000
And Americans everywhere.

177
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.800
You'd never know there was a
depression in that country.


178
00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.400
Please, something to drink
before I faint.


179
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.120
They don't shop, they pillage.

180
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.000
And they speak loudly.

181
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.480
Could the entire nation be
hard of hearing?


182
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.520
Something in the diet, perhaps?

183
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.640
But we have American
friends, mama.


184
00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.320
They don't need to know what
we say about them.


185
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.440
If everyone knew what everyone
said of each other...


186
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.240
there wouldn't be four friends
in the world.


187
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.560
I like America.

188
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.560
Name me another society that's gone
from barbarism to decadence...


189
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.440
without bothering to create a
civilization in between.


190
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.480
Tribute to American efficiency.

191
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.960
- There's Mr Windemere.
- He must join us then.


192
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.240
He can't see you, mama.

193
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.080
Who's that with him?

194
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.080
Looks like his wife.

195
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.480
No, I don't think it is.

196
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.640
I can't see now.
They're getting into the car.


197
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.040
It must be the wife if she's
getting into the car.


198
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.120
It wasn't her.

199
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.320
Then I must know who it is.

200
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.440
I think we should mind our
own business.


201
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.320
My own business bores me.

202
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.880
I much prefer other people's.

203
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.400
Poor little Meg,
she's so sweet.


204
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.520
And the girl has no mother.

205
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.400
- I want to take her to my breast.
- I had a similar thought.


206
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.120
I don't suppose Mr Windemere
would be pleased to hear it.


207
00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.800
Merital bliss...

208
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.080
is a great burden to place
on two people, Tuppy.


209
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.840
Sometimes a third person is
needed to lighten the load.


210
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.520
It would seem,
Mr Windemere agrees with you.


211
00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:18.240
I can guess what you were doing.

212
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.200
Shopping for my birthday present?

213
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.200
I was right.

214
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.920
What did you get?

215
00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.600
Not a thing. You're too old
for presents.


216
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.880
- A hint. A tiny speck of a hint.
- You'll have to wait and see.


217
00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.360
- Perfume?
- No, stop it.


218
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.640
A book of poems?

219
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.480
A dress?

220
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.240
A crocodile handbag like the
one the Contessa has...


221
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.480
with the little claws hanging
off the bottom?


222
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.720
No more guessing.

223
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.440
Robert?

224
00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.400
Promise we won't end up like those
old married couples...


225
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.200
sitting opposite each other at
dinner with nothing to say.


226
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.720
You, with nothing to say?

227
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.800
I promise.

228
00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.080
We'll always tell each
other the truth?


229
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.400
Except around birthdays.

230
00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.160
You're feisty.
What have you been reading?


231
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.400
- What do you mean?
- No, it's nice.


232
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.120
Turn out the lights.

233
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.000
- But I like to see you.
- Please?


234
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.080
I'll take them all.

235
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.000
- Good day, madam.
- Excuse me.


236
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.400
I bought a suit.

237
00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.520
It's being altered.
For Margaret Windemere.


238
00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.960
Ah, Mrs Windemere.
One moment, please.


239
00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.160
Thank you.

240
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.720
Forgive me.
You're American, aren't you?


241
00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:15.320
I'm from New York.
Mrs Erlynne.


242
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.760
Rhode Island.
Mrs Windemere.


243
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.480
I need an opinion from here.
Now be honesty.


244
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:27.320
Would you wear it?

245
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.160
Well, it doesn't leave much
to the imagination, does it?


246
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.400
That depends on the imagination.
Some men have more than others.


247
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.600
I suppose it's certainly immodest.

248
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.760
Do you think it's vulgar?

249
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.040
Some people might.

250
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.480
Is your husband with you?
I'd love a man's opinion.


251
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:57.240
I can tell you.
He's very conservative.


252
00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.720
A woman doesn't know
her own husband.


253
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.160
Oh, I know Robert.
We've been married over a year.


254
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.120
A year? Pratically forever.

255
00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.040
Here it is, signora.

256
00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.120
Oh, thank you.

257
00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.160
Thank you very much.
Come back again to see us.


258
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:16.160
- Goodbye
- You're not taking the hat?


259
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:18.640
The colour looks perfect on you.
Don't you like it?


260
00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.880
No, I've nowhere to wear it.
It's not exactly church on sunday.


261
00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.400
Why not?

262
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.800
Can you imagine what
people would say?


263
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.520
Well, if we're always guided by
other people's thoughts...


264
00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.440
what's the point of
having our own?


265
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.400
It was nice meeting you,
Mrs Ewin.


266
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.840
- Erlynne.
- Erlynne.


267
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.040
She was staying in a pensione...

268
00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.760
now she's in a villa a
few minutes from the club.


269
00:18:58.760 --> 00:18:59.960
He's there.

270
00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.320
I can't help seeing him.

271
00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.640
He comes and goes all
hours of the day.


272
00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.120
Of course, in public, she's
always with other men.


273
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.880
She wears nothing but
the latest fashions.


274
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.000
Somebody must be giving her a very
generous allowance.


275
00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:30.560
Silęnce!

276
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.320
And she'll have her hand in Tuppy's
pocket next, if he doesn't wake up.


277
00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.040
She's nothing better than
a common prostitute.


278
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.600
And Mrs Windemere has no idea?

279
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.920
None at all.

280
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.280
- I'm sorry.
- She must be on the terrace.


281
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.000
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to frighten you.


282
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.920
- Yes, you did.
- Yes, you did. What's that?


283
00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.360
I'm making a menu for
my birthday party.


284
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.520
What's italian for lobster?

285
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.280
Aragosta.

286
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:32.280
Aragosta.

287
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.720
Very good. Now you've made me hungry.

288
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.840
Leave it, come on. Everyone's
lunching at the club.


289
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.200
Okay. I'll get Robert.

290
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.760
I thought you agreed not to
call me at home?


291
00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.040
How can I seduce you if you
always bring your husband?


292
00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:03.640
Too slow. Come on.

293
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.520
All right.

294
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.160
Yes, I'll be there.
In an hour.


295
00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.880
Okay, in an hour.

296
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.960
It's quitting time.
We're going to lunch.


297
00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.680
Can't, sorry.

298
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.400
- You're working?
- Money never sleeps.


299
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.160
Bugger!

300
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.440
All paying jobs absorb...

301
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.240
and degrade the mind.

302
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.720
You never had a paying job.

303
00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.440
I rest my case.

304
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.400
Cultivated leisure is
man's true calling.


305
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.160
- I have to send some telegrams in town.
- I'll wait for you.


306
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.760
I'll be all afternoon.
I don't want you to waste the day.


307
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.000
- Do you mind, John?
- Do I mind?


308
00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.840
No, of course not.

309
00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.000
If you have to escort that woman to
the opera, please don't sit with us.


310
00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.320
Think of Alessandra.

311
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.200
Mrs Erlynne has her own seats.

312
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:04.880
Who pays for them?

313
00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.360
Her uncle just died.
She's come into some money.


314
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.800
And Mr Windemere's visits?

315
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.080
He's managing her investments,
of course.


316
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.880
You're so fond of gossip.

317
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.040
You don't give the truth a chance
to put its pants on.


318
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.200
It's not the truth that's going without
pants, dear Tuppy.


319
00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.400
Would you mind not smoking?

320
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.320
Opera makes me feel so romantic.

321
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.480
Anything too stupid to be
said is sung.


322
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.280
How's that romantic?

323
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.440
And the women are
always so fleshy!


324
00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.560
Excuse me, that's my foot.

325
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.440
Right over here?

326
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.520
What did I tell you?

327
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.320
Stop, boy!

328
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.080
Fried anchovies and clams
in a bog. Delicious.


329
00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.000
Careful, it's hot.

330
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.120
You told Robert we were
going to the club.


331
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.760
I have a very poor sense
of direction.


332
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.440
You have a very poor sense
of decorum.


333
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.840
I never use that word.
I'm not sure what it means.


334
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.040
- At the club we'd be with other people.
- You're right.


335
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.640
Here we are,
in the sunshine...


336
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.760
eating fish, literally
just off the boat...


337
00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:21.720
when we could be squashed between Lord
Tubby and Cecil the Scintillating...


338
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:24.440
listening to one or the
other gripe about his digestion...


339
00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.840
while the Contessa, in a
counter-medley, wails that...


340
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.760
Alessandra cares more for...

341
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.680
the mating habits of the
blue bellied finch...


342
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:33.960
than those of her own species,
and the widow Plymdale...


343
00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.280
bats her eyes logingly every
passing pair of trou.


344
00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.000
All of which is time well
spent in my book.


345
00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:42.360
So, yes, I take your point.

346
00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.520
I can't argue. At the club, we'd
be with other people.


347
00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.640
Afraid we'll be seen?

348
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Set the chins wagging?

349
00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.320
Do you know what I find
worse than being talked about?


350
00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.800
Not being talked about at all.

351
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.040
Mrs Erlynne will see you upstairs.

352
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.400
In her bedroom.

353
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.680
Thank you. I won't be long.

354
00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.920
"I won't be long."

355
00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:05.720
This is expensive.

356
00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.280
- Nothing but the best for you.
- I know, I paid for it.


357
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.520
Well, there is that.

358
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.040
Should we be drinking this
early in the day?


359
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.720
Well, somewhere in the world
it's very late.


360
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.040
I don't want you thinking
I make a habit of this.


361
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.080
Is that why you look so guilty?

362
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.040
I don't like lying to her.

363
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.600
I should go.
She's only gone to lunch.


364
00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.920
This is all the cash
I have right now.


365
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.440
I'll set you up with an account.

366
00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.880
You can draw on it directly.

367
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.920
I met Meg.

368
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.480
It was by chance.

369
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:42.800
It's all right,
she had no idea who I was.


370
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.520
You spoke to her?

371
00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.120
Yes, for a minute.
She's very pretty.


372
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.160
How did you two meet?
Was it love at first sight?


373
00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.640
I have to go.

374
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.600
I'm curious. It's only natural.

375
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.840
There's no point
to these questions.


376
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.520
- Do you love her?
- Very much.


377
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.080
I'd rather cut off my arm
than see Meg hurt.


378
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.560
Are you protecting her or
your reputation?


379
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.120
You don't know me at all.

380
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.880
Did he work on your
wedding night?


381
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.280
He's very conscientious
and I respect him for it.


382
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.720
Suppose it wasn't work,
suppose he had a mistress.


383
00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:28.640
Well, I couldn't respect that.

384
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.320
Once a wife's been betrayed...

385
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.320
she has the freedom to
do likewise.


386
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:34.640
No, that would make her as bad
as her husband, wouldn't it?


387
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.440
Modern marriage thrives on
mutual deception.


388
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.640
We are completely honest
with each other.


389
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.480
You should make
him your model.


390
00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.720
I intend to.
From this moment on.


391
00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.720
Don't you like it?

392
00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.680
Oh, I'm saving it for Robert.
He loves figs.


393
00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.240
Share mine, then.

394
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.440
Can we go to the
telegraph office?


395
00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.240
He probably hasn't eaten.

396
00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.280
Alberto? Fabrizio?

397
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.720
Oh, what's his name?

398
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.480
Mario?

399
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.560
Barman.

400
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.440
Whisky.

401
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:19.080
And another thing, your Mrs Erlynne
has no principles at all.


402
00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.200
I like people more than principles.

403
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.040
And people without principles,
even better.


404
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:27.480
But Lord Augustus, she only
wants you for your money.


405
00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.560
Now why shouldn't she?
It's my best asset.


406
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.000
Old-ish, fat-ish,
absolutely no brain...


407
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.640
heaps and heaps of banknotes.

408
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.600
No need to
put yourself down, Tuppy.


409
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.000
Your friends can always do that.

410
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:44.840
Down by the marina, strolling along,
pretty as you please...


411
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.840
guess who I saw with
Lord Darlington?


412
00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.600
They haven't seen him today.

413
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.920
Do you know where
my husband is?


414
00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:22.440
I thought he left
after you, signora.


415
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.280
Robert?

416
00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.520
How was lunch?

417
00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:53.000
We went to the telegraph office.
Where were you?


418
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.320
Well, we must have just
missed each other.


419
00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.480
Now I see uncle.
He's with the american woman.


420
00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.920
Too much rouge and not
enough clothing.


421
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.360
She's appealing to the worst
in the poor man.


422
00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.280
It's what women do best.

423
00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.640
I heard she left New York
without paying her hotel bill.


424
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.480
Quite a scandal.

425
00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.280
- Who? Someone you know?
- Someone you don't want to know.


426
00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.680
No. Steer clear.

427
00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.800
She's the one
with Lord Augustus.


428
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.920
You've met Mrs Erlynne,
haven't you?


429
00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.040
- No.
- But I've seen you.


430
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.240
Oh, was that your foot?

431
00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.200
Wherever do you find
shoes to fit?


432
00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.640
My feet are in perfect proportion
to the rest of me.


433
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.000
Oh, yes, of course.

434
00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.000
Though they have a habit of finding
themselves in peculiar places.


435
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.840
Those people are
staring right at us.


436
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.000
Who?

437
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.160
Don't worry about them.

438
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.600
It's my brother's wife and
her friend, Lady Plymdale.


439
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.200
Lord Plymdale passed on
last year. Liver, I think.


440
00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.560
- Poor woman.
- Oh, yes, very sad.


441
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.360
Her hair turned quite
gold with grief.


442
00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:37.560
Erlynne, that's right.
She came into some money.


443
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.080
- I made an investment for her.
- An inheritance, I suppose?


444
00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:44.960
The woman in the shop.
I told you, remember?


445
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.480
The dress?

446
00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.720
No, back and almost no front.
You could see everything.


447
00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:51.160
It was indecent.

448
00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.160
You're just not used to
Italian fashions, that's all.


449
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.040
No, I'm sure your wife is
on the mark.


450
00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.760
Mrs Erlynne is a
notorious Jezebel.


451
00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:00.520
That's a slanderous statement. If you
can't back it up, I wouldn't repeat it.


452
00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.920
Robert always gives everybody
the benefit of the doubt.


453
00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.480
I'm sorry, I just don't like gossip.

454
00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.480
Gossip's all right, it's the
moralising that's in poor taste.


455
00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.960
She's got her eye on me,
if you know what I mean.


456
00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:16.440
So I wouldn't worry about what they
say, it's all cats in a bag.


457
00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.120
Why, what do they say about me?

458
00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:22.200
That I'm a wanton woman?

459
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.960
Brazen - with a past.

460
00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.120
A brazen woman.
Oh, dear.


461
00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.880
You're very brazen yourself
to be seen in my company.


462
00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.600
I've got a bit of a past
myself you know.


463
00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.600
Married and divorced twice.

464
00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:36.880
Every experience is of value and
whatever you say...


465
00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.280
about marriage it certainly
is an experience.


466
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.280
People call something
an experience...


467
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.960
They usually mean
it was a mistake.


468
00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.800
I couldn't agree more.

469
00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.760
We've all got a couple of
skeletons in the closet.


470
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.120
If they're going to rattle,
they may as well dance.


471
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.960
You're absolutely right.

472
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.960
Whenever anyone agrees with me,
I'm sure I must be wrong.


473
00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.280
You like to be the
odd man out, do you?


474
00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.600
I'll never understand women.

475
00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:02.440
Women don't want to be understood,
they want to be loved.


476
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.560
You're dead wrong on that.

477
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.000
You're very understanding.

478
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.640
That girl in lilac,
do you know her?


479
00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:14.200
Oh, yes, it's Robert's wife.

480
00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:16.320
All lovey-dovey,
very charming.


481
00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.400
I wish she'd stop staring at me.

482
00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:24.560
She isn't at all.

483
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:27.280
Those women must be
giving her an earful.


484
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.000
- You mustn't mind.
- I don't, as a rule.


485
00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.040
Look, it's terribly stuffy in here,
I can hardly breathe.


486
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.280
Shall we go? Would you mind?

487
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.280
I can't think of anything
I'd mind less.


488
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.560
Good.

489
00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:48.840
I can't believe it - she's got him!

490
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.040
Poor Tuppy.

491
00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.640
Shall I get a taxi?

492
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.760
- Could we walk?
- Why not.


493
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:13.160
Beautiful city.

494
00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.440
The Romans call it
"The Land of the Sirens..."


495
00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.040
from Homer's Odyssey.

496
00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.000
Is that so? Aren't you clever?

497
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.520
- I read it somewhere.
- I like a good read myself.


498
00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.560
Nothing too laborious. I don't want
to tamper with natural ignorance.


499
00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.640
- It's the key to happiness.
- Do you really think so?


500
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.720
Absolutely. Good health,
it's important, but...


501
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:33.120
ignorance is the key. Too much
knowledge and you're doomed.


502
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.360
Well, here we are.

503
00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.960
Aren't you going to invite me
in for a nightcap?


504
00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.280
The sirens were said to be
half woman, half monster.


505
00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.600
They lured the sailors with
their songs.


506
00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.200
The ships crashed on the
rocks and the men all drowned.


507
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.040
Oh, let's go in. You can tell me
more about it.


508
00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.400
Poor Lady Plymdale, I think she
really likes Tuppy.


509
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.440
- Where do you suppose they went?
- Who?


510
00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.640
Tuppy and Mrs Erlynne.

511
00:34:24.640 --> 00:34:26.000
Probably back to her apartment.

512
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.920
Probably.

513
00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.120
Do you think he'll invite
her to my party?


514
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.080
I'll make sure he doesn't.

515
00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.800
- Well, don't be mean about it.
- No, of course not.


516
00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.920
It's just I don't want anyone
to be uncomfortable, you know?


517
00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:42.720
Someone like that makes
things awkward.


518
00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.400
You can say it's a small party.
Private, just friends.


519
00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:49.000
- No investors.
- All right.


520
00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:54.800
It's not just girl gossip. John
Darlington knows all abou it.


521
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.560
He said her friend is
a married man.


522
00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.560
It's disgusting.

523
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.120
You know what, people like to
hear themselves talk.


524
00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.600
- Why do you insist on defending her?
- I'm not defending her.


525
00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.400
Yes, you are.

526
00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:15.320
Let's drop it.

527
00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.960
It's just... Should you
be helping her invest?


528
00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.640
Everyone knows how she
came into the money.


529
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.560
New topic.

530
00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.880
Close your eyes.

531
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.680
- Robert?
- Close your eyes.


532
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.600
It's after midnight.
Happy birthday.


533
00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.880
- It's beautiful.
- Do you like it?


534
00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:03.160
Thank you.

535
00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.040
- I love you.
- I love you, too.


536
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.560
Oh, my!

537
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.480
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.


538
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.880
You like it?

539
00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.120
Food is the rock...

540
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.280
on which we build.

541
00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:45.080
No love is pure and simple
as the love of food.


542
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.240
Love is rarely pure, Lord Augustus.
And never simple.


543
00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.680
I don't think you've been
in love, Mrs Erlynne.


544
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.720
You may presume
to call me Stella...


545
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.640
but don't presume
to know my heart.


546
00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.040
For your information,
I'm always in love.


547
00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.920
Good. Excellent attitude.
And you're beautiful.


548
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.160
Smart, too. Smarter than me,
I expect, but...


549
00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:07.160
that's not saying much,
I'm afraid.


550
00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.560
No, I think I'll do very well
to marry you.


551
00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.760
How very practical.

552
00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.680
I've begun too many romances
out of sentiment.


553
00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.400
They always end in settlement.

554
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.600
I could listen to you all night,
Lord Augustus.


555
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.840
Tuppy, please.

556
00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.800
You'll think about my offer?

557
00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.480
Men don't marry women like me.

558
00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.160
There aren't any women like you.

559
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.440
At least, not among the women
I've met, and I've met my share.


560
00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.800
I was married 
- I didn't take to it.

561
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.240
People change. You might
feel differently.


562
00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.200
When I think of it, I think
of a room...


563
00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.640
where you can't open a window.

564
00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.280
Where there is no window.

565
00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:55.920
Every day you wake up
and the room is smaller.


566
00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.320
You don't notice, not at first.
It happens slowly.


567
00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.120
In inches.

568
00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.000
Then one morning,
you open your eyes...


569
00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.560
and the room is so small...

570
00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.240
you can't move.

571
00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.280
You can't take a breath.

572
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.200
You have to get out.

573
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:23.040
You can't think of anything else.

574
00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.040
Or anyone else.

575
00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:28.400
You married the wrong man,
that's all.


576
00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.960
He married the wrong woman.

577
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.400
It's late.

578
00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.920
It's time for bed.

579
00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.880
Sleep.

580
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.840
"...Perchance to dream".

581
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.360
That's the bard, you know.
I'm a bit of a reader myself.


582
00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.560
So you said. Goodnight, Tuppy.

583
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.360
I hate the taste of tobacco.

584
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.160
Well - that's it then.

585
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.760
I quit. On the spot.

586
00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.920
What else can I tell you?

587
00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.680
I'm a very rich man, you know.

588
00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.680
You're a very nice man.

589
00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.720
Go to bed.

590
00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.720
You know, I'm glad I quit.

591
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.440
Filthy habit, really.

592
00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.080
Goodnight.

593
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.120
Is there going to be a lion tamer,
or is it just the usual clowns?


594
00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.040
Robert was afraid it might rain.

595
00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.000
I just wanted a few people for dinner
but he said you are only 21 once.


596
00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.920
I know plenty of women who, of their
own accord, turn 35 year after year.


597
00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:27.480
I'm sure you can
be 21 as many times.

598
00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:29.520
I think it's silly
to lie about your age.

599
00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.200
- You have no redeeming vices.
- I hope not.


600
00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.440
Happy Birthday.

601
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.600
The invitation said no gifts.

602
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.520
That's why I brought it now.

603
00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:47.760
It's too expensive. I know you
don't mean anything by it, but...


604
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:49.240
it wouldn't look right.

605
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.160
Gold looks right with everything.
Just wear it. No-one has to know.


606
00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:53.760
I'd know.

607
00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.600
I do mean something by it.

608
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.520
- Please...
- It's a gift of friendship, Maggie.


609
00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.760
You'll hurt me deeply if you refuse.

610
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.160
Now look what you've made me do.

611
00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.240
A little sincerity can be a very
dangerous thing.


612
00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.800
Any more could be fatal.

613
00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:08.880
Just take the damn thing before
I die and ruin your terrace.


614
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.360
It's very pretty. Thank you.

615
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.640
Where's Robert? Off sending
another telegram?


616
00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.720
Signora, the florist is waiting
for his money.


617
00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.480
I'll have to get it from
Mr Windemere.


618
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.040
Can he come back later?

619
00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.960
Has Robert a cheque-book
in his office?


620
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.920
- Can you sign on the account?
- Ah, yes, of course.


621
00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:34.240
Tell him to wait.
I'll see you tonight.


622
00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:36.560
People don't always behave
the way we expect.


623
00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.560
Just the opposite. The truth is I
don't want to see you hurt.


624
00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:42.640
What are you talking about?

625
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.120
You may need a friend
one of these days.


626
00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.360
When you do, I'm here.
Will you remember that?


627
00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.600
Yes, of course.

628
00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.920
I came as quickly as I could.

629
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.160
We're all so distressed over it.

630
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:35.880
But you mustn't take it personally.

631
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.040
Mrs Erlynne is one of
those women...


632
00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.960
that attract men like a
bee to a flame.


633
00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.320
- A moth.
- Bee to a moth.


634
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.160
There must be some
other explanation.


635
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.160
I have an idea - shall
we go for a walk?


636
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.560
When there's marriage without love,
there'll be love without marriage.


637
00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.360
But Robert and I married
for love...


638
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.160
Of course. And so did I.

639
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.720
But before the year was over...

640
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.120
Benito was lifting all kinds
of petticoats.


641
00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:26.760
I had to dismiss my best maid.

642
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:28.800
No, no, I remember.

643
00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.920
I passed her on to
my cousin.


644
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:33.760
Her husband was so
short-sighted, I thought.


645
00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.080
But he navigated by scent,
it seems.


646
00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:40.280
So unfortunate.

647
00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:43.520
Believe me, darling,
it happens to us all.


648
00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:46.320
Undying love is like the
ghost in your villa.


649
00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.720
Everybody talks about it...

650
00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.200
but try and find one person
who has seen it.


651
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.840
- Can I ask you a favour?
- Anything at all.


652
00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:00.760
About, Mrs Erlynne...

653
00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:03.520
Very clever woman.

654
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.360
She threw me out last night.

655
00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:07.720
Knows what a fool I am.
Knows it as well as I do myself.


656
00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:10.320
She's meeting me here
for tea, though.


657
00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:17.360
It's a great thing to come across a
woman who thoroughly understands me.


658
00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.880
Would you mind not bringing
her to our party tonight?


659
00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.760
That's the favour?

660
00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.720
Meg feels it might make
things awkward.


661
00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.520
So it's true, then?

662
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.800
I don't believe it.
You don't seem the type.


663
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:33.640
Though I will say Mrs Erlynne's damn
fascinating. Hard to resist, but...


664
00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:38.840
You're not serious, are you?

665
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.360
I warn you, you'll have to
fight me for her.


666
00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:43.200
And I'm a man in love.

667
00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.120
What are you talking about?

668
00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.400
This ways, Mrs Erlynne.

669
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.200
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


670
00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.680
- Come with me.
- Where are you taking me?


671
00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.640
- Let go of my arm.
- I have to talk to you.


672
00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:04.440
I'm meeting Lord Augustos.

673
00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.640
You must leave Amalfi at once.

674
00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.400
And go where? You've paid my
rent here for the season.


675
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.760
I'll pay it somewhere else. I want
you on the first plane out tomorrow.


676
00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:15.200
- I don't understand.
- People are talking.


677
00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.720
About us.

678
00:46:18.600 --> 00:46:20.120
I don't see the humour.

679
00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.440
Bury a real secret and
a false one pops up in its place?


680
00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.120
There's a certain irony,
you have to admit.


681
00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.400
I'm not ready to leave.
I'm enjoying myself here.


682
00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.120
I'm begging you.

683
00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.080
Think of Meg. If she knew that
you were her mother...


684
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:40.920
it would destroy her.

685
00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.160
Meg, of the magnificent
Windemeres?


686
00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.960
Family scandal is unhealthy
for aspiring politicians.


687
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.960
I'm not the only pragmatist
in this room.


688
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:53.040
Pragmatist? Twenty years,
and not a word.


689
00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.480
You turn up when she marries
a man with money.


690
00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:58.120
You call that pragmatism?
I can think of other words.


691
00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:00.080
Are you trying to hurt
my feelings?


692
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:02.920
Do you have any? That can't
be purchased, I mean.


693
00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.160
How much - to get you
on the first flight out?


694
00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.040
I feel every time he's
kissed me it's filthy.


695
00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.840
A lie, every minute we've
been together.


696
00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:20.880
How could he?

697
00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.120
Every man is born truthful
and every man dies a liar.


698
00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.160
Now, whatever you do, you
mustn't make a scene.


699
00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.320
It's too unpleasant.
And you waste your energy.


700
00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.840
No, of course not. I wouldn't.

701
00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.640
Crying is the refuge
of plain women.


702
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:39.840
Pretty women go shopping.

703
00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.760
Be on that plane.
I'll send the cash.


704
00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:06.520
Did I hear you correctly?

705
00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.760
That Meg Windemere is
your daughter?


706
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:12.120
My daughter?

707
00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.080
Robert's wife?

708
00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.440
How dare you.

709
00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.600
She must be twenty at least.
Her mother?


710
00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.960
Do I look as old as all that?

711
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:26.400
Of course not.

712
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.520
I must have nodded off.

713
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.760
You were dozing.
Go back to sleep.


714
00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:46.040
Come on.

715
00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:07.640
No business tonight.
We can talk another day.


716
00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.640
- Good to see you.
- Lovely party.


717
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:11.640
More champagne.

718
00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.480
Welcome.
Have a great party.


719
00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.840
- Good evening, Mr Dumby.
- Oh, good evening, Mrs Stutfield.


720
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:49.480
Last party of the season,
I suppose.


721
00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.400
- It's been delightful, hasn't it?
- Quite delightful.


722
00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:56.840
Good evening. Here it is,
the last party of the season.


723
00:49:57.360 --> 00:50:00.760
I suppose so. It's been a very dull
season, though, hasn't it?


724
00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.080
Dull. Yes, terribly dull.

725
00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.440
- Evening, Cecil.
- Hello, Dumby.


726
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.520
I suppose this'll be the last
party of the season.


727
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.680
Surely not. Probably
be two more at least.


728
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.320
I had the oddest dream today.

729
00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:14.840
A bit of it has just
come back to me...


730
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.600
So what are we drinking?

731
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.920
- Where's the birthday girl?
- Transforming herself.


732
00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:20.680
Sausages and women.

733
00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.600
If you want to enjoy the
experience...


734
00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.440
never watch the
preparation of either.


735
00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.400
- Is that new?
- Just out of the box. Do you like it?


736
00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:40.720
You might be a little cold.
I'll get you a wrap.


737
00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.960
And spoil the lines? Didn't your friend
teach you about Italian fashion?


738
00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:45.640
My friend?

739
00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:47.920
I saw the cheques. Don't even...

740
00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.040
Lady Plymdale, so good of
you to come.


741
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.800
Do you want another glass of
champagne?


742
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.760
Let's get us both some.

743
00:51:55.520 --> 00:51:57.240
Why don't you ask me how I am?

744
00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:59.280
I like people to ask.

745
00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.280
It shows a widespread
interest in my health.


746
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:03.480
And you can't imagine how
comforting that is.


747
00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.680
Lovely party.

748
00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.440
- How are you, Cecil?
- Oh, not well at all.


749
00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.000
I'd like Alessandra...

750
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.200
to know Mr. Hopper
from Austrália.


751
00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.800
- Would you introduce her?
- Would you just excuse me for a moment?


752
00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:19.040
Go with Mr Windemere.
Thank you.


753
00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.440
She's my last, you know.
I will miss her.


754
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.080
But it's best to get them out
of the nest...


755
00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:27.160
before they turn on you.

756
00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:30.280
Girls begin by loving their mothers.
But as they grow they judge us.


757
00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:32.920
Rarely do they forgive us.

758
00:52:36.120 --> 00:52:38.960
Oh, poor fool.
He'll never learn.


759
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:41.240
Which fool?
Don't make me choose.


760
00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.360
Tuppy,
he's brought Mrs Erlynne.


761
00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.360
All the women will snub her.

762
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.840
She may have better
luck with the men.


763
00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:50.560
It is because of men...

764
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.920
that women distrust other women.

765
00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.520
Women don't trust women,
men don't trust women...


766
00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:57.480
no-one trusts women.

767
00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:00.040
It's what binds the Hindu
and the Catholic.


768
00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.560
I know I promised, but I must tell
you how beautiful you look tonight.


769
00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.280
Well, if you must, you must.

770
00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:20.840
I beg your pardon, I was
looking for someone else.


771
00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.960
Well, you found me.

772
00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.880
Mrs Erlynne.

773
00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.720
May I call you Stella?

774
00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:29.480
Lord Augustus is getting
me champagne.


775
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.760
You and I can trade favours.

776
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.880
Tempting, but no.

777
00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.720
I'd rather he didn't see us under the
moonlight. He might misunderstand.


778
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.720
Hear me out.

779
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.040
Windemere's fortune exceeds Tuppy's.

780
00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:43.440
Why change horses now?

781
00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.720
You can have waht you
want and Meg's free.


782
00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:47.920
Free?

783
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.000
She hasn't the courage to leave him.

784
00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.240
But if it's clear to her that
he's with you...


785
00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.480
He's not.

786
00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.520
You've been buying idle gossip.
You should get a refund.


787
00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:01.400
Excuse me.

788
00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:04.000
I had to invite her, Dumby.

789
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.160
The point is, she's a changed woman.
You can see it in her eyes.


790
00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:09.720
Do you think she'd look at
you if you were poor?


791
00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:11.560
Do you think I'd look at her
if she were ugly?


792
00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.920
Fair's fair, exchange rates
and so forth.


793
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.120
I know she's had her this
and her that, but...


794
00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:18.520
if a man can tolerate
his own past...


795
00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:21.120
Why not a past in his wife?
At any rate...


796
00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.840
it's wipe the slate.
Clean start.


797
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.840
She and I, we...
understand each other.


798
00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.160
And you know what they say.

799
00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:32.240
Every saint has past,
every sinner has a future.


800
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.760
I'm going to ask her to marry
me if she'll have me.


801
00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.160
You know why they call it
an altar, Tuppy?


802
00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.560
It's where they make
human sacrifices.


803
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.400
I had a dream about
Mrs Erlynne today.


804
00:54:51.680 --> 00:54:52.480
Yes, well...

805
00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.520
you couldn't help it,
I suppose. She...


806
00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.040
she is quite the woman.

807
00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:00.120
But in future...

808
00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:02.680
please try to dream of
someone else.


809
00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:27.560
Don't you think you've
had enough?


810
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.880
- Lovely party.
- Thanks for coming.


811
00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:49.520
Meg?

812
00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.600
I have to change.

813
00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:53.640
- Did you see her?
- Don't.


814
00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.800
You're lovely.

815
00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.160
It's ridiculous on a woman at her age.

816
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.800
Why didn't you tell me?

817
00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:03.600
You said you were my friend.

818
00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:05.960
Men and women can't be friends.

819
00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:11.960
- Meg?
- No.


820
00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.240
Can you stay with him?

821
00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.680
Can you get into bed
with him tonight?


822
00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.720
Tomorrow night?
Nights after that?


823
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.040
You said yourself, there's no
forgiving a man who betrays his wife.


824
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.280
What will you choose?

825
00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.920
A false degrading marriage, or your
own true self, free of compromise?


826
00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.920
I've loved you from the beginning.
It's the truth.


827
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.800
Moment you held out your hand to me in
the glove shop, I thought 'there she is".


828
00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.640
And then, suppose I'd walked
by without stopping?


829
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.840
Just the thought of it.

830
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.280
I've never loved anyone until now.

831
00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.280
Stop.

832
00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:16.400
John?

833
00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.440
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you.


834
00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.960
I'm looking for Meg. If you see her,
it's important.


835
00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.440
Have you had a row?

836
00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.800
A little misunderstanding.

837
00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.400
Try the bar.

838
00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.200
Tuppy's given up smokes for her.

839
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.520
Women.

840
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:42.440
Women inspire us to great things.

841
00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:44.920
Then somehow prevent us
from doing any of them.


842
00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:47.800
He's proposing to her.

843
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.520
It will be his
third time up the aisle.

844
00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.280
Hope trumps experience, Dumby.

845
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.360
It's God's joke on the human race.

846
00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:56.960
He's quite convinced she's
changed her spots.


847
00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.440
Care to make it interesting?

848
00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.040
I told you I was serious.

849
00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:05.680
Hasn't anyone warned you
against me?


850
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.680
Oh, yes. Everyone.

851
00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:10.720
Put it away.

852
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.360
Now, you don't have to love
me right away.


853
00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.480
Think of the money.

854
00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.640
Suppose I marry you, and in a year
your investments go sour.


855
00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:21.200
I'll be stuck with a pauper.

856
00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:22.760
On the other hand...

857
00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.480
I could drop dead on the golf course
next Tuesday...


858
00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.600
and you'd be left very
well-appointed.


859
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:27.640
Life's a gamble, Stella.

860
00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.840
I don't know what to say.

861
00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.040
People say too much as it is.

862
00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.040
Mrs Windemere and
Mrs Erlynne...


863
00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.480
Iook like mother and daughter,
don't they?


864
00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.840
They're wearing the same dress.

865
00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:04.640
Well, that'll be it.

866
00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:12.240
Come away with me.

867
00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.600
We could set sail tonight.

868
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.200
Please.

869
00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.480
Is this your idea of a joke?

870
00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.360
I need to speak to you.
It's about Darlington.


871
00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.160
Follow me.

872
00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.960
He's in love with Meg.

873
00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.640
I know we said cash, so I'm raising
the amount. I want you to leave now.


874
00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.560
I'd be more concerned
if I were you.


875
00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:46.320
You're not me.

876
00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:48.360
The problem is I've been
lying to my wife...


877
00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:50.320
and I'm not very good at it.

878
00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.200
I can add up the rumours...

879
00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.920
and show her a big fat zero.
I'm Tuppy's girl.


880
00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.520
- Case closed.
- I'll do my own explaining, get out.


881
00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.640
I'd like to say goodbye to her.

882
01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:05.360
You said goodbye to her twenty
years ago. No second chances.


883
01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.680
I'll leave first.

884
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:17.560
- We shouldn't walk out together.
- You're the expert.


885
01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.480
Count to a 100.

886
01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.400
Mrs Windemere?

887
01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.160
Dear Robert, I thought our
marriage was perfect.


888
01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.720
I thought we would
always be together.


889
01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.040
If you love Mrs Erlynne,
you should be with her.


890
01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.840
I feel so foolish.

891
01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.920
Everyone knew but me.

892
01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.120
Meg, let me in,
I wanna talk to you.


893
01:02:36.440 --> 01:02:38.600
Please, open the door.

894
01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.840
There is nothing between me
and Stella Erlynne.


895
01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.120
How can you think it?

896
01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.440
She's old for God's sake.
She dyes her hair.


897
01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.720
She paints her face
like an Indian.


898
01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.280
She's a cold,
selfish woman.


899
01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.320
Not all attractive
once you know her.


900
01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.480
Look, she was going
to damage someone.


901
01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.280
A person who'd never done
her any harm.


902
01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.960
She came here with a secret that
would have broken your heart.


903
01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:11.160
Look, I wanted to tell you. I just
didn't know how.


904
01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.160
I was trying to protect you,
you have to believe me.


905
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:20.000
She asked me for money
and I gave it to her, but...


906
01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.400
I'm not proud of
being blackmailed...


907
01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.480
I didn't know what else to do.

908
01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.760
I should have told you
at the start.


909
01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.200
I'm not lying to you now, I...

910
01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.680
I love you.

911
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.840
And there's no other
woman in my heart...


912
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.520
or in my bed.

913
01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.440
Meg...

914
01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.960
please open the door.

915
01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:50.960
We both had too
much champagne.


916
01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:53.480
We can talk in the morning.

917
01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.560
- Splendid.
- Thank you for coming.


918
01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:16.840
- Lovely party. Goodnight, Robert.
- I'll see you at the club.


919
01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:21.760
- There's the girl.
- Take Windemere to the club.


920
01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:25.000
Keep him out all night.
Get him drunk if you have to.


921
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.400
- Just don't let him come home.
- Why?


922
01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:32.120
What? What?

923
01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.640
I like you, I do.

924
01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.680
But if this is going to work
between us, you can't do that.


925
01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.680
- Do what?
- "Where? What? Why?"


926
01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.840
I can't always explain
myself to myself...


927
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.000
let alone anyone else.

928
01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.200
Good for you -
takes the pressure off.


929
01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.320
Nine times out of ten, men
don't give two pins about why...


930
01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.440
they just feel obliged
to take an interest.


931
01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:56.080
So, I'll do exactly as you wish...

932
01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.680
and I'll feel as if
we're married already.


933
01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.720
Oh, can you get yourself
home all right?


934
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.200
Why, Tuppy...

935
01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:06.360
you're the first man who's
asked me that.


936
01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.800
I don't need to be the first,
Stella. Just the last.


937
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.320
There's a taxi waiting
at the end of the dock.


938
01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.400
My husband sent you.

939
01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:15.960
Your husband thinks you're
in bed sleeping off...


940
01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.120
a litre of Perrier Jouet.

941
01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.080
Let's go.

942
01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:23.960
He gave me money,
that's all.


943
01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.880
I'm an old friend of the family.

944
01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:27.640
Do you think I'm stupid?

945
01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.680
Married to man you love
and running off...


946
01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:32.960
with an international playboy?
Do I think you're stupid?


947
01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.360
This is none of your business.

948
01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:36.160
You think because hems are higher
and women can vote...


949
01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.240
that anything has
really changed for us?


950
01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:40.840
Friends will stop calling.

951
01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:43.000
He'll be invited into homes
you're not.


952
01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.920
You manage.

953
01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.440
Don't compare yourself.

954
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.880
It takes practice and
skill to live without regret.


955
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.560
A marriage takes
your whole heart.


956
01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:59.120
Selfish people can't pull it off,
but you're not that.


957
01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:01.720
You can succeed where
the rest of us fail.


958
01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:05.640
- Why should I believe you?
- Don't believe me, believe him.


959
01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:09.440
He's been faithful to you,
I'll swear it on my life.


960
01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.080
He told you to lie.

961
01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.520
He doesn't even
know you're here.


962
01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:20.400
He never has to know.

963
01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.160
You want me to lie again?

964
01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.240
Everything's spoiled
between us. I can't.


965
01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.040
What's happened to you?

966
01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.000
Who taught you to be so
unforgiving?


967
01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.000
You made a mistake,
don't make it worse.


968
01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.560
You shut your eyes to everything
that isn't perfect...


969
01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.560
you're just asking to fall
into a hole.


970
01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.920
Fine.

971
01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.080
Go ahead.

972
01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.160
Step over love to pick up
pride and guilt.


973
01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.240
What will that trade
be worth in a year?


974
01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.680
In twenty?

975
01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.720
Darlington, does your boat
really have to be so big?


976
01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:15.840
You know what they say about
men with big boats.


977
01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.600
- I should be getting home.
- You'll take a cigar, surely?


978
01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:21.400
I thought you'd quit
for the love of a good woman.


979
01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:24.960
Good woman isn't exactly the
moniker I'd choose for Mrs Erlynne.


980
01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.480
You imply she's
the devil's handmaiden.


981
01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:30.360
Dumby and I are just concerned
for your future.


982
01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:35.480
Devilish women are a bother,
and good ones are a bore.


983
01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:37.600
That's the only difference.

984
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:39.480
Mrs Erlynne is neither a bother
nor a bore.


985
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.680
You change your habits,
but I doubt she'll change hers.


986
01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.280
I've bet Dumby fifty quid.

987
01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.000
Enough of this.

988
01:08:47.160 --> 01:08:49.360
I won't hear any more words
said against her.


989
01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.400
She's everything I've ever
wanted in a woman.


990
01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:55.960
My dear Tuppy, in this world
there are only two tragedies.


991
01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.000
One is not getting what one wants,
the other is getting it.


992
01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:03.680
The last is very much the worst.
The last is a real tragedy.


993
01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.440
Marriage.

994
01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.640
It has its pains - ask Edna.

995
01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.040
Celibacy has no pleasures.

996
01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.280
- What would you know about it?
- I can learn.


997
01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:16.480
If it will prove my love.

998
01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.760
A woman who needs proof?

999
01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.320
Before she'll leave her husband.

1000
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.840
John, you are a cad.

1001
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.120
We're all in the gutter.

1002
01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:26.880
But some of us are looking
at the stars.


1003
01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.040
What men call gallantry...

1004
01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.720
ans God's adultery...

1005
01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:35.760
is far more common
where the climate's sultry.


1006
01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.960
That's the one I bought Meg.

1007
01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.320
For her birthday.

1008
01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.280
Are you sure?

1009
01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:48.040
She must have left it last week
when you came for lunch.


1010
01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.200
She was carrying it tonight.

1011
01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.480
One fan looks very much
like another.


1012
01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.000
John?

1013
01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.320
- I've no idea.
- Meg's not here, is she?


1014
01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.320
No, of course not.

1015
01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.360
- What's that?
- I didn't hear anything.


1016
01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.560
She's downstairs.

1017
01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.080
Calm down.
You've had too much...


1018
01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.280
Don't make an ass of yourself.

1019
01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:15.480
Too late.

1020
01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.600
- Bloody hell!
- You better put some ice on that.


1021
01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:26.920
I thought it was mine.

1022
01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.760
I must have picked up
Mrs Windemere's by mistake.


1023
01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.800
Tuppy, I swear, 
I had no idea.

1024
01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.560
You owe Cecil fifty quid. Sorry.

1025
01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.840
It seems I'm the ass,
Windemere. Not you.


1026
01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.480
I spent the night on John's boat.

1027
01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.440
I had too much to drink.

1028
01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.800
Can I ask you to forgive me?

1029
01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.960
I did something very stupid
last night.


1030
01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.720
You're not in my league.

1031
01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.560
I made a complete ass of myself.

1032
01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.560
Ruined it for poor Tuppy.

1033
01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.560
Better now than later, I guess.

1034
01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:40.840
Tuppy?

1035
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.320
His engagement to
Mrs Erlynne is off.


1036
01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.840
What are you talking about?

1037
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.040
Last night on John's yacht, Mrs
Erlynne was waiting in his bedroom.


1038
01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.400
Look, I was drunk, I thought...

1039
01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.520
I saw your fan, 
I thought that...

1040
01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.040
I didn't think.

1041
01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.360
It was her.

1042
01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:02.200
She said she took it by mistake.

1043
01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.600
- No, that's not true.
- Oh, of course not.


1044
01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.920
Better count the spoons.

1045
01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.040
You were right
not to want her here.


1046
01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.200
I'd have expected more from John,
though. Tuppy's his friend.


1047
01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.960
She didn't take my fan.
I left it on the...


1048
01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:18.640
There's a telephone call
from America.


1049
01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.200
It's your father, Mr Windemere.

1050
01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:23.960
Not now.

1051
01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.000
No, I'll take it.
He'll worry.


1052
01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.000
- I love you.
- I love you.


1053
01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:41.240
And a woman brought this.

1054
01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.200
She's waiting downstairs.

1055
01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:51.280
Thank you.

1056
01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.320
What are you doing here?
We had an agreement.


1057
01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.800
I came to return the fan.

1058
01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.440
How is your wife
feeling this morning?


1059
01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.040
You don't get within ten feet
of my wife.


1060
01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.120
I only asked how she was.

1061
01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:35.200
If you're here to tell
her who you are...


1062
01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.120
it's better coming from me.

1063
01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:39.920
It's my secret, not yours.

1064
01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.640
You've kept it very well.

1065
01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.400
Twenty years is a long time.

1066
01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.560
It doesn't seem to have been
too much of a strain.


1067
01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:53.480
You see a little girl...

1068
01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.040
the right age,
you push the thought aside.


1069
01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.520
Close the door.

1070
01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.280
Only at three o'clock,
that in-between hour...


1071
01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.440
too late to do anything,
too early for dinner...


1072
01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.120
doors come flying open.

1073
01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:11.560
I don't believe you feel
anything for her.


1074
01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.160
You care about yourself,
and no-one else.


1075
01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.200
Robert.

1076
01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.120
Your father needs to talk to you,
he says it's important.


1077
01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.640
Mrs Erlynne
came to return your fan.


1078
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:28.280
She was just leaving.

1079
01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:30.680
No, don't leave, I need to
speak with you.


1080
01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.480
- She'll miss her plane.
- Just a few minutes.


1081
01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.520
Your father's waiting on the phone.
He said it's important.


1082
01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:45.600
It would be a great mistake...

1083
01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:48.320
to miss your plane.

1084
01:15:59.720 --> 01:16:01.560
I came to make sure
you got home safely.


1085
01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.480
You can't leave yet.

1086
01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.960
You're my only witness that
nothing happened.


1087
01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.880
Your witness?

1088
01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.760
I'm going to tell him the truth.

1089
01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.240
What you did is your mistake.

1090
01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.000
Your sack of bricks. You carry it.

1091
01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.800
You don't confess and had it off
to someone who loves you.


1092
01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:21.520
But everybody thinks
you were having...


1093
01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:23.360
They'll think it anyway.
It doesn't matter.


1094
01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:25.880
That's not true,
it matters to Tuppy.


1095
01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.800
I can't be responsible
for ruining that.


1096
01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:30.560
You wanna spoil the one
good thing I've ever done?


1097
01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.520
It's only right to tell him
the truth.


1098
01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.160
You love each other!
That's your truth.


1099
01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:41.320
Why you giving up your chance
of marriage to save mine?


1100
01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.560
- It doesn't make any sense.
- I'll tell you the truth.


1101
01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.520
But first, promise you're not
going to make...


1102
01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:48.440
some grand confession.

1103
01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.840
Swear it on whatever you
hold sacred.


1104
01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:57.520
I swear on my mother.

1105
01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.120
Pardon?

1106
01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.200
She's my guardian angel.

1107
01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.480
My whole life, I've wanted
to be like her.


1108
01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.600
I'm sure she wouldn't hold you
to such a standard.


1109
01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:18.200
She'd be so ashamed of me now.

1110
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.000
We all straddle the abyss,
Mrs Windemere.


1111
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.680
If we never look down, how can
we know who we are?


1112
01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.960
A mother could never be ashamed
of a daughter who didn't fall in.


1113
01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:38.080
I hope you're right.

1114
01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.320
I've never been more certain
of anything.


1115
01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.240
I swear, them.

1116
01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:50.360
What is it you wanted to tell me?

1117
01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.120
Nothing.

1118
01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.880
I'll miss my plane.

1119
01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.080
Goodbye, Mrs Windemere.

1120
01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.000
I hope we meet again.

1121
01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.160
So do I.

1122
01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.120
Mrs Erlynne.

1123
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.720
- You didn't tell her?
- No.


1124
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.960
Why not?

1125
01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.760
She has a mother.

1126
01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.400
A photograph in a locket.

1127
01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.600
It's a fairy tale.

1128
01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:45.560
A kind, caring mother, who loves
and watches over her.


1129
01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:49.080
I'm not going to take that away.

1130
01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.720
And neither should you.

1131
01:19:06.960 --> 01:19:09.720
Mrs Erlynne,
One thousand Dollars.


1132
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.400
For one night I thought you were in
love with another woman.


1133
01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.680
For one night I thought you were in
love with another man.


1134
01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:17.760
- She was right.
- Who?


1135
01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:22.280
Mrs Erlynne said we can't
shut our eyes...


1136
01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.640
to everything that isn't perfect...

1137
01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.280
otherwise we might fall
into a huge abyss.


1138
01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.760
We almost fell.

1139
01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.800
She's a smart woman.

1140
01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.160
She's a good woman.

1141
01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:36.800
Better than I thought.

1142
01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:13.840
She insisted.

1143
01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:19.160
Who?

1144
01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:22.360
Meg.
Something to remember her by.


1145
01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:25.640
And she explained everything.

1146
01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:27.760
Everything?

1147
01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.200
Oh, yes, couse.
The flat tyre, the dog.


1148
01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.080
The Brazilian taxi diver with the
pregnant daughter...


1149
01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.960
who lost her purse.

1150
01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:36.560
And the only thing I can say
in my defense is...


1151
01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.400
that I have no defense.

1152
01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.200
I jumped to conclusions and
thought the worst.


1153
01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:48.120
Where's this old crate going to?

1154
01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.520
I don't know.

1155
01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.960
Will you marry me when get there?

1156
01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.280
A man gets the wife he deserves.

1157
01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:03.560
Well, I've been a very, very bad man.

1158
01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.520
You know, John,
love's a battleground.


1159
01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:17.920
It was only a flesh wound.

1160
01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:20.720
Men advance,
women resist.


1161
01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:24.240
We retreat and they
block our escape.


1162
01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:25.800
We can't win.

1163
01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.400
The sexes will never understand
each other.


1164
01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:31.240
Only because they take such pains
to deceive each other.


1165
01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
Oh, hello Dumby,
are you awake?


1166
01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.920
Am I winning?
