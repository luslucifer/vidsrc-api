1
00:00:07.596 --> 00:00:09.829
- Ready?
- Yeah.


2
00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:10.731
Now you can look.

3
00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:21.138
- It’s for you.
It’s for the baby.


4
00:00:21.138 --> 00:00:23.074
Thank you.

5
00:00:26.615 --> 00:00:27.243
Hi.

6
00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:02.245
Hi!

7
00:01:16.094 --> 00:01:17.633
Okay.

8
00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:30.009
First Space-tions,
scene nine, take four.


9
00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.010
Frick, Roger.

10
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.649
We’re already
chasing light here!


11
00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:34.145
Come on,

12
00:01:34.145 --> 00:01:35.651
I know you’ve got
performance anxiety,


13
00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:38.248
but you’re gonna be okay.

14
00:01:43.088 --> 00:01:44.693
And... action!

15
00:01:44.693 --> 00:01:45.892
Report! Report!

16
00:01:45.892 --> 00:01:46.827
Talk to me.
What’s happening?


17
00:01:46.827 --> 00:01:49.226
I’d guess
an anti-gravity charge


18
00:01:49.226 --> 00:01:50.326
from the boarding unit, sir.

19
00:01:50.326 --> 00:01:51.964
15 colonial ships, sir!

20
00:01:51.964 --> 00:01:53.933
They’re just holding position

21
00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.364
outside the kill zone.

22
00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:56.233
Captain,

23
00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:57.640
the firing control
for the main cannon,


24
00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.301
it’s hit, it’s offline.

25
00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:00.336
Form our defense perimeter.

26
00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:01.238
Something isn’t right.

27
00:02:01.238 --> 00:02:03.679
The fleet’s only
supposed to have a few ships.


28
00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.077
This one has over...

29
00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:07.650
Beep-beep-beep-beep...

30
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.048
This one has over 50!

31
00:02:09.048 --> 00:02:10.818
This is Admiral Klattsassin.

32
00:02:10.818 --> 00:02:13.755
The prime minister,
he’s gone too far this time.


33
00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:15.120
Negative, Admiral.

34
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.790
Stand down.

35
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.321
We have to get the tsung’in
off that ship, sir.


36
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:20.795
I can’t live without it!

37
00:02:20.795 --> 00:02:22.391
Captain, what should we do?

38
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:24.195
It’s time. We need him.

39
00:02:24.195 --> 00:02:26.296
We need Tyler.

40
00:02:27.835 --> 00:02:28.803
Get...

41
00:02:28.803 --> 00:02:29.870
me...

42
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.805
a...

43
00:02:30.805 --> 00:02:32.708
weapon...

44
00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:33.874
Cut!

45
00:02:35.074 --> 00:02:35.711
Thanks, guys.

46
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:37.439
Thanks, Sharon.
Beautiful lady.


47
00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.945
You too, Rog.
You’re handsome.


48
00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:41.882
Uh, I don’t know
what you look like, so, uh...


49
00:02:41.882 --> 00:02:45.721
Yeah, you’re handsome, anyways.

50
00:03:45.946 --> 00:03:46.409
Hiya, Matty.

51
00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.048
Thanks for lending me
your toaster


52
00:03:48.048 --> 00:03:48.784
for my latest film.

53
00:03:48.784 --> 00:03:50.149
It’s, uh... it’s got,
it’s got everything.


54
00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:52.821
It’s got a mix between tragedy,
drama, horror,


55
00:03:52.821 --> 00:03:54.087
comedy, and stuff like that,

56
00:03:54.087 --> 00:03:55.791
and, uh, it’s in space!

57
00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:56.990
So thanks.

58
00:04:05.164 --> 00:04:07.430
Hey, guys, come to
my newest and latest film.


59
00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.771
It’s called
"First Space-tions."


60
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:10.037
Yeah, we’ve got aliens,
there’s stuff that’s cool.


61
00:04:10.037 --> 00:04:12.237
I play this one character,
I go--


62
00:04:12.237 --> 00:04:13.172
Kill lots of aliens,

63
00:04:13.172 --> 00:04:16.010
and yeah, see you then.

64
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.947
Hiya, Beggy.

65
00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:22.917
This gave the film
exactly what it needed.


66
00:04:24.117 --> 00:04:25.250
Okay...

67
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.317
What is it?

68
00:04:26.317 --> 00:04:27.823
What is this?

69
00:04:28.187 --> 00:04:30.255
What is this?

70
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:34.863
Heya, Haya.

71
00:04:34.863 --> 00:04:35.392
I want to thank you

72
00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:37.097
for your contribution
to the film.


73
00:04:37.097 --> 00:04:39.198
This isn’t mine.

74
00:04:39.198 --> 00:04:40.001
It isn’t?

75
00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:43.169
Where’s my toaster?

76
00:05:18.973 --> 00:05:20.503
Oh, that’s a good question.

77
00:05:20.503 --> 00:05:22.439
Um, well, of course, we...

78
00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:24.045
of course,
we’ve planned for Sundance,


79
00:05:24.045 --> 00:05:26.014
and we had a lengthy
back-and-forth


80
00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:27.378
with the jury of Cannes,

81
00:05:27.378 --> 00:05:29.984
and, well, it felt right.

82
00:05:29.984 --> 00:05:32.119
It felt right
to premiere my latest work


83
00:05:32.119 --> 00:05:33.384
right here in the rez,

84
00:05:33.384 --> 00:05:35.452
and I think they’ll like it.

85
00:05:35.452 --> 00:05:37.893
They’ll like it,
and they’ll be proud,


86
00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:39.862
and they’ll see
something that I created,


87
00:05:39.862 --> 00:05:43.998
and maybe they’ll be happy,

88
00:05:43.998 --> 00:05:45.396
I’ll be happy,

89
00:05:45.396 --> 00:05:48.135
we’ll all be happy, and...

90
00:05:48.135 --> 00:05:49.169
Dad...

91
00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.040
he’ll finally know
that I’m here.


92
00:06:18.231 --> 00:06:19.298
Hey, Dad.

93
00:06:19.298 --> 00:06:20.903
Tyler.

94
00:06:20.903 --> 00:06:23.401
Oh, you’re going to work
in the woods?


95
00:06:23.401 --> 00:06:24.270
Yep.

96
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.074
When are you back?

97
00:06:26.074 --> 00:06:28.670
Can’t say.

98
00:06:30.012 --> 00:06:33.345
Well, I finished
another movie,


99
00:06:33.345 --> 00:06:34.445
and, uh...

100
00:06:34.445 --> 00:06:37.580
me and, uh,
Sammy helped me organize


101
00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.955
another screening for it.

102
00:06:39.955 --> 00:06:40.956
I can’t make it.

103
00:06:40.956 --> 00:06:42.321
I’ll be working then.

104
00:06:42.991 --> 00:06:47.392
Well, if you came,
you’d get a VIP pass.


105
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.134
Make sure you go stay with Etsu.

106
00:06:53.134 --> 00:06:55.938
She needs help fishing.

107
00:06:55.938 --> 00:06:58.568
I’ll come pick you up
when I get back.


108
00:07:46.385 --> 00:07:48.255
And here we have

109
00:07:48.255 --> 00:07:50.356
the beautiful bird.

110
00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:52.523
Don’t know what the hell
they’re called,


111
00:07:52.523 --> 00:07:55.460
but we’re gonna eat one.

112
00:07:58.463 --> 00:08:04.436
The hunter lays its trap
for its prey...


113
00:08:10.673 --> 00:08:12.246
...and as you can see,

114
00:08:12.246 --> 00:08:14.017
the predator has failed,

115
00:08:14.017 --> 00:08:16.679
and he will starve
for the winter and die.


116
00:08:17.383 --> 00:08:19.715
This is
my movie-screening place.


117
00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:23.620
It’s not much, but it’s great.

118
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.589
Has what you need.

119
00:08:31.034 --> 00:08:32.266
This is a...

120
00:08:32.266 --> 00:08:36.039
this is a place
where magic happens.


121
00:09:10.073 --> 00:09:12.636
Sammy! Etsu!

122
00:09:12.636 --> 00:09:14.077
Hey, Tyler,

123
00:09:14.077 --> 00:09:15.408
are you excited or what?

124
00:09:15.408 --> 00:09:17.443
I’m actually
kind of nervous, Sammy.


125
00:09:17.443 --> 00:09:19.775
- There’s nothing
to be nervous about.


126
00:09:24.747 --> 00:09:26.716
When is this thing
going to start?


127
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.497
All right, everybody,
settle down.


128
00:09:38.497 --> 00:09:41.599
We’re showing the film.

129
00:09:43.304 --> 00:09:45.108
Everybody try
Isobel’s nuwish.


130
00:09:45.108 --> 00:09:50.476
The bestest Indian ice cream
this side of Chilcotin.


131
00:09:52.709 --> 00:09:56.251
It’s Isobel’s ice cream.

132
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.853
Oh, bingo at John Louie’s
tonight,


133
00:10:04.853 --> 00:10:09.165
and if anybody wanna bingo,
you can leave now.


134
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.139
Get outta here!

135
00:10:16.139 --> 00:10:18.273
Get out!

136
00:10:18.405 --> 00:10:20.671
I want to introduce
a young man,


137
00:10:20.671 --> 00:10:21.243
Tyler.

138
00:10:21.243 --> 00:10:25.808
Tyler, Tyler,
Tyler, Tyler, Tyler.


139
00:10:32.749 --> 00:10:33.420
Uh, hi.

140
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.159
I’d like to show you
a movie that I made,


141
00:10:36.159 --> 00:10:39.789
and, uh, I hope you like it.

142
00:10:45.168 --> 00:10:47.203
Run the film.

143
00:11:06.816 --> 00:11:07.718
Report! Report!

144
00:11:07.718 --> 00:11:10.325
Talk to me.
What’s happening?


145
00:11:10.325 --> 00:11:11.458
I guess there was a boar...

146
00:11:11.458 --> 00:11:13.394
one of the boarding units, sir!

147
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:15.495
The fire control
for the main cannon, it’s hit!


148
00:11:15.495 --> 00:11:16.364
It’s offline.

149
00:11:16.364 --> 00:11:18.465
Captain, what should we do?

150
00:11:18.465 --> 00:11:22.271
It’s time. We need him.
We need Tyler.


151
00:11:25.868 --> 00:11:26.968
Get...

152
00:11:26.968 --> 00:11:27.969
me...

153
00:11:27.969 --> 00:11:29.278
a...

154
00:11:29.278 --> 00:11:29.641
weapon.

155
00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:44.986
Uh, seche’enalyagh for coming.

156
00:11:44.986 --> 00:11:47.593
Uh, I’d like to answer
your questions now.


157
00:11:50.233 --> 00:11:52.367
Uh... anybody?

158
00:11:52.367 --> 00:11:53.863
First Space-tions II...

159
00:11:53.863 --> 00:11:56.701
coming to a rez near you.

160
00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:07.910
I shouldn’t have scheduled it
the same night as bingo night.


161
00:12:10.682 --> 00:12:12.816
I liked it.

162
00:12:14.356 --> 00:12:14.950
Seche’enalyagh, Etsu.

163
00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:18.855
Okay, I’m going to go do
some thinking now.


164
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.648
Oh! Shi--

165
00:13:31.565 --> 00:13:32.863
Dad?

166
00:14:04.631 --> 00:14:07.700
Hey, you there in the back.

167
00:14:08.701 --> 00:14:10.571
Well, good question,
good question.


168
00:14:10.571 --> 00:14:11.869
Well, first of all,

169
00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:12.903
I’d like to thank everybody

170
00:14:12.903 --> 00:14:14.608
for their kind comments
about the film,


171
00:14:14.608 --> 00:14:16.006
and to answer your question,

172
00:14:16.006 --> 00:14:17.776
yes, it was truly an accident.

173
00:14:17.776 --> 00:14:20.680
In the industry,
we call that a happy accident.


174
00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.551
Only if that happened
in real life, am I right?


175
00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:29.392
Yes, could we get a mic there,
please?


176
00:14:29.392 --> 00:14:30.152
Thanks.

177
00:14:31.054 --> 00:14:33.396
Yeah. Uh-huh.

178
00:14:33.396 --> 00:14:34.925
Well, good observation.

179
00:14:34.925 --> 00:14:35.662
You’re right.

180
00:14:35.662 --> 00:14:38.797
It was a symbol
of her relationship to him,


181
00:14:38.797 --> 00:14:41.998
and, uh, yeah, good catch.

182
00:14:41.998 --> 00:14:43.472
Thanks.

183
00:15:49.901 --> 00:15:51.233
Where’s Smitty?

184
00:15:51.233 --> 00:15:53.004
Oh, he’s not here.

185
00:15:53.004 --> 00:15:54.005
He’s taking time off.

186
00:15:54.005 --> 00:15:56.545
Sherry had her kid.

187
00:15:56.545 --> 00:15:58.613
I knew that.

188
00:15:58.613 --> 00:16:01.517
Yeah, I’ll talk to you
in a bit.


189
00:16:01.517 --> 00:16:03.212
All right, you betcha.

190
00:16:56.133 --> 00:16:59.740
It wasn’t your fault.

191
00:17:22.664 --> 00:17:24.326
Hey!

192
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:27.933
What are you doing
sitting around?


193
00:17:28.967 --> 00:17:32.004
I said, what are you doing
sitting around?


194
00:17:32.004 --> 00:17:33.906
I’m just thinking, Sammy.

195
00:17:33.906 --> 00:17:36.711
- I think you’re wasting
your time.


196
00:17:36.711 --> 00:17:39.011
I think I found
Dewey’s old gun.


197
00:17:39.011 --> 00:17:39.813
What?

198
00:17:39.813 --> 00:17:42.113
I said,
I found Dewey’s old gun--


199
00:17:48.119 --> 00:17:51.056
Put the gun right up here.

200
00:17:51.056 --> 00:17:52.222
Right on the shoulder,

201
00:17:52.222 --> 00:17:54.597
and straighten this one up
like that,


202
00:17:54.597 --> 00:17:56.160
and look through this scope

203
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.064
like winking at a woman, okay?

204
00:17:59.064 --> 00:18:01.231
One eye shut.

205
00:18:19.315 --> 00:18:21.284
You see my gun?

206
00:18:21.284 --> 00:18:22.790
Straight.

207
00:18:22.790 --> 00:18:25.288
Put the X right at ’em.

208
00:18:31.129 --> 00:18:32.262
Pow!

209
00:18:32.262 --> 00:18:34.670
That’s how you shoot
a white man.


210
00:18:52.886 --> 00:18:56.989
What’s the next
blockduster film...


211
00:18:56.989 --> 00:18:58.024
bud?

212
00:18:58.925 --> 00:18:59.827
I don’t know.

213
00:18:59.827 --> 00:19:02.665
I don’t think anybody
wants to watch ’em.


214
00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:05.196
I saw a guy
pissing in the back, Sammy.


215
00:19:05.196 --> 00:19:07.231
Probably a dog.

216
00:19:07.231 --> 00:19:09.398
- There’s like another reason
why they go there.


217
00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:12.840
It’s like...
they feel sorry for me.


218
00:19:13.874 --> 00:19:16.943
I don’t know, 
I could be crazy.

219
00:19:16.943 --> 00:19:17.812
It keeps you busy.

220
00:19:17.812 --> 00:19:20.716
It’s better than
what keep me busy.


221
00:19:21.849 --> 00:19:23.214
True dat, Sammy.

222
00:19:23.214 --> 00:19:23.818
True dat.

223
00:19:23.818 --> 00:19:26.250
Plus, keeping busy’s
the smart thing to do.


224
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:30.089
Keep you from
thinking too much.


225
00:19:52.144 --> 00:19:54.212
Thanks for
letting me drive, Sammy!


226
00:19:54.212 --> 00:19:56.082
Any time.

227
00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:57.951
Did I forget my camera?

228
00:19:57.951 --> 00:19:59.019
What?

229
00:19:59.019 --> 00:20:00.251
My camera.

230
00:20:00.251 --> 00:20:01.153
What?

231
00:20:01.153 --> 00:20:03.254
My camera!

232
00:20:03.254 --> 00:20:05.992
Oh, the camera!

233
00:20:11.866 --> 00:20:12.999
Oh, Tyler...

234
00:20:12.999 --> 00:20:13.736
Yeah?

235
00:20:13.736 --> 00:20:15.969
Are you going to make Western?

236
00:20:15.969 --> 00:20:17.136
Maybe.

237
00:20:17.136 --> 00:20:19.270
If you’re going to do it,
I want to star in it.


238
00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.008
Because you know what?

239
00:20:21.008 --> 00:20:23.076
I want to shoot a white man.

240
00:20:24.747 --> 00:20:27.344
I’ll think about it.

241
00:20:41.028 --> 00:20:44.767
Looks like they’re making
some gravitational force machine


242
00:20:44.767 --> 00:20:46.429
over there.

243
00:20:55.877 --> 00:20:59.013
That trampoline’s a beast!

244
00:20:59.013 --> 00:21:00.542
Oh, that might be
a new movie prop.


245
00:21:00.542 --> 00:21:02.115
I could use it for, like...

246
00:21:02.115 --> 00:21:03.918
I could use it
as a gravitational device,


247
00:21:03.918 --> 00:21:06.350
so, like, when a guy
jumps on top of it,


248
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.156
he goes to another part
of the spaceship.


249
00:21:40.021 --> 00:21:42.221
Whoa, yeah.

250
00:21:49.096 --> 00:21:50.262
Yay. Done.

251
00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:54.035
Found something.

252
00:21:54.035 --> 00:21:56.136
Yeah, it’s...

253
00:21:56.136 --> 00:21:58.237
I found this in Dad’s drawer.

254
00:21:58.237 --> 00:22:00.173
Why would he have this?

255
00:22:00.173 --> 00:22:04.243
It’d be so cool
if he was into making movies.


256
00:22:04.243 --> 00:22:08.181
That’d be beast, but...

257
00:22:20.457 --> 00:22:24.527
I saw some kids with their dads
and moms the other day,


258
00:22:24.527 --> 00:22:27.002
and, well...

259
00:22:27.002 --> 00:22:27.497
it kind of...

260
00:22:27.497 --> 00:22:29.268
kind of made me think
if I had a dad and mom


261
00:22:29.268 --> 00:22:33.272
who’d look after me
like that, well...


262
00:22:36.044 --> 00:22:38.508
I guess sometimes...

263
00:22:38.508 --> 00:22:40.411
sometimes I think...

264
00:22:40.411 --> 00:22:42.149
I think it’s my fault.

265
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:43.282
What is that?

266
00:22:43.282 --> 00:22:44.316
Holy!

267
00:22:50.289 --> 00:22:51.158
What are you doing here?

268
00:22:51.158 --> 00:22:52.994
This is my... this is my spot.

269
00:22:52.994 --> 00:22:54.293
Huh, that’s funny.

270
00:22:54.963 --> 00:22:57.900
This happens to be
my favourite spot too.


271
00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.298
Well, I’ve been here for years.

272
00:22:59.298 --> 00:23:00.365
I’ve never seen you up here.

273
00:23:00.365 --> 00:23:02.037
Whatcha filming?

274
00:23:02.037 --> 00:23:03.203
Personal interview.

275
00:23:03.203 --> 00:23:05.469
"Personal interview"?

276
00:23:05.469 --> 00:23:07.306
Do anything else?

277
00:23:08.109 --> 00:23:08.637
I make movies.

278
00:23:08.637 --> 00:23:11.211
I just finished this movie
called "First Space-tions."


279
00:23:11.211 --> 00:23:13.015
It’s from
a new video game I like,


280
00:23:13.015 --> 00:23:14.115
but from a sequel,

281
00:23:14.115 --> 00:23:16.414
and, uh, well,
it’s not exactly like it,


282
00:23:16.414 --> 00:23:18.581
but, uh, because
I don’t have the rights,


283
00:23:18.581 --> 00:23:20.352
and I don’t want to be sued.

284
00:23:20.989 --> 00:23:22.453
That’s pretty beast.

285
00:23:22.453 --> 00:23:23.487
Really?

286
00:23:23.487 --> 00:23:24.323
Yeah.

287
00:23:24.323 --> 00:23:26.160
That’s a cool camera, too.

288
00:23:27.062 --> 00:23:27.590
Thanks.

289
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:30.230
It’s pretty old,
it’s pretty beat up, but...


290
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.495
it has--

291
00:23:31.495 --> 00:23:33.266
a sweet zoom lens.

292
00:23:33.266 --> 00:23:35.433
You know your stuff.

293
00:23:38.007 --> 00:23:39.008
Yeah, um...

294
00:23:39.008 --> 00:23:42.572
I just finished a movie
down there at the rink.


295
00:23:42.572 --> 00:23:43.979
Everybody loves ’em.

296
00:23:43.979 --> 00:23:45.080
Wow. Really?

297
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:45.377
Yeah.

298
00:23:45.377 --> 00:23:46.378
You know, I’d be down
to see those.


299
00:23:46.378 --> 00:23:48.347
I have to clear
some of the music rights,


300
00:23:48.347 --> 00:23:52.450
but my people
can call your people.


301
00:23:54.188 --> 00:23:55.420
I’m Aaron, by the way.

302
00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.093
I’m Tyler, very good sir.

303
00:24:02.526 --> 00:24:04.561
Is that yours?

304
00:24:05.496 --> 00:24:07.201
Yeah.

305
00:24:07.201 --> 00:24:10.171
You smoke?

306
00:24:12.173 --> 00:24:14.010
Nah.

307
00:24:15.704 --> 00:24:18.212
Wh-where are you from?

308
00:24:22.513 --> 00:24:23.316
Is this, uh...

309
00:24:23.316 --> 00:24:25.219
Oh, that’s mine, sorry.

310
00:24:25.219 --> 00:24:26.517
It’s very personal.

311
00:24:26.517 --> 00:24:27.287
Sorry, I gotta go.

312
00:24:27.287 --> 00:24:29.685
I think you might need
to work on your Chilcotin


313
00:24:29.685 --> 00:24:31.456
a little bit.

314
00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:15.368
Where are we going?

315
00:25:15.368 --> 00:25:16.303
Mom?

316
00:25:16.303 --> 00:25:18.470
Just this little
spot I found.


317
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.208
It’s beautiful.

318
00:25:20.208 --> 00:25:21.605
I know you’re going to love it.

319
00:25:22.639 --> 00:25:25.246
It’s where the rivers meet.

320
00:25:25.246 --> 00:25:27.677
It’s so perfect.

321
00:25:27.677 --> 00:25:28.381
Dad?

322
00:25:28.381 --> 00:25:30.119
This is our spot?

323
00:25:30.119 --> 00:25:31.582
It’s for the baby.

324
00:25:31.582 --> 00:25:33.056
Oh, thank you.

325
00:25:33.056 --> 00:25:33.617
Aw...

326
00:25:33.617 --> 00:25:35.124
Oh, he’s kicking.

327
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:39.458
He’s moving a lot.

328
00:25:39.458 --> 00:25:41.592
Hey...

329
00:25:41.592 --> 00:25:43.297
Hi!

330
00:26:09.686 --> 00:26:11.622
Can you see the lens?

331
00:26:11.622 --> 00:26:13.492
Lookit there.

332
00:26:13.492 --> 00:26:16.528
Hi. Hi.

333
00:26:37.219 --> 00:26:38.616
Hi, Mom.

334
00:26:38.616 --> 00:26:41.619
Wow, it’s like the first time
I ever said that,


335
00:26:41.619 --> 00:26:44.325
and I know I’m not actually
saying it,


336
00:26:44.325 --> 00:26:45.755
and you’re actually
not hearing it,


337
00:26:45.755 --> 00:26:49.462
but I just wanted to say it
because...


338
00:26:49.462 --> 00:26:50.826
I saw you.

339
00:26:50.826 --> 00:26:52.201
I saw you alive,

340
00:26:52.201 --> 00:26:54.764
and it just felt...

341
00:26:54.764 --> 00:26:57.668
it felt different.

342
00:26:57.668 --> 00:26:58.702
Nobody...

343
00:26:58.702 --> 00:27:00.803
nobody will tell me about you,

344
00:27:00.803 --> 00:27:03.443
and, like...

345
00:27:03.443 --> 00:27:05.544
I don’t know
how to think about you.


346
00:27:05.544 --> 00:27:09.812
Why am I talking to a camera
and not you?


347
00:27:11.814 --> 00:27:13.684
Did I...

348
00:27:13.684 --> 00:27:16.753
did I do something wrong?

349
00:27:16.753 --> 00:27:19.492
Why... why did you...

350
00:27:19.492 --> 00:27:21.692
why did Dad... why...

351
00:27:21.692 --> 00:27:23.925
Aah, this is so stupid.

352
00:27:23.925 --> 00:27:25.531
Aah, God.

353
00:28:09.311 --> 00:28:12.413
You want to film something?

354
00:28:41.376 --> 00:28:42.575
Let’s do some scrunning!

355
00:28:57.425 --> 00:28:58.921
Peek-a-boo.

356
00:29:27.851 --> 00:29:31.020
Like, when I finish
a movie, it’s like...


357
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.693
it’s like it only exists
because I did it.


358
00:29:34.693 --> 00:29:35.628
I made it.

359
00:29:35.628 --> 00:29:37.828
Man, that’s cool.

360
00:29:37.828 --> 00:29:38.961
Like, really?

361
00:29:38.961 --> 00:29:39.566
Yeah.

362
00:29:39.566 --> 00:29:41.964
With your camera,
it keeps the past alive.


363
00:29:41.964 --> 00:29:42.734
You know?

364
00:29:42.734 --> 00:29:44.670
Shit, it even changes the past.

365
00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:45.671
How it’s remembered.

366
00:29:45.671 --> 00:29:48.674
People who are dead
can still be seen.


367
00:29:48.674 --> 00:29:50.841
You can remember how they look,

368
00:29:50.841 --> 00:29:52.447
how they laugh,

369
00:29:52.447 --> 00:29:54.482
how they move.

370
00:29:54.482 --> 00:29:56.781
It’s wild.

371
00:29:56.781 --> 00:29:59.685
They really can live forever
in your camera.


372
00:29:59.685 --> 00:30:00.016
Wow.

373
00:30:00.016 --> 00:30:02.589
I never thought of it
like that before.


374
00:30:02.589 --> 00:30:03.887
I know.

375
00:30:03.887 --> 00:30:06.461
Where are you from?

376
00:30:06.461 --> 00:30:08.727
Same as you, man.

377
00:30:08.727 --> 00:30:10.092
What about your family?

378
00:30:10.092 --> 00:30:12.995
Your Aba, your Inkwel,

379
00:30:12.995 --> 00:30:15.767
your Etsi, Etsu--

380
00:30:15.767 --> 00:30:16.636
Sorry.

381
00:30:16.636 --> 00:30:18.374
I gotta go.

382
00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.875
See ya, bruh.

383
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:07.819
Etsu!

384
00:31:07.819 --> 00:31:09.392
Etsu, sorry I’m late!

385
00:31:09.392 --> 00:31:11.691
I’ll be down there
in a second!


386
00:31:42.425 --> 00:31:45.857
The fishing gillnet
go like this.


387
00:31:45.857 --> 00:31:48.464
Like this...

388
00:31:48.959 --> 00:31:51.698
You move it up.

389
00:31:51.698 --> 00:31:55.669
Keep bringing it back up.

390
00:32:23.763 --> 00:32:28.197
You go like this...

391
00:33:07.038 --> 00:33:11.547
Okay, I’ll show you the...
the salt.


392
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.617
Just go like this.

393
00:33:18.818 --> 00:33:22.789
Okay, watch it dig in.

394
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:24.956
Go like this.

395
00:33:26.793 --> 00:33:28.257
Hold it like that.

396
00:33:28.257 --> 00:33:30.896
Okay.

397
00:33:41.072 --> 00:33:44.877
What was Inkwel like?

398
00:35:35.889 --> 00:35:38.859
This is the way how we do that,

399
00:35:38.859 --> 00:35:41.928
and, uh, put this together.

400
00:35:44.931 --> 00:35:47.198
Right across here.

401
00:35:47.198 --> 00:35:48.836
So we can link...

402
00:35:48.836 --> 00:35:50.904
make it link together,

403
00:35:50.904 --> 00:35:52.873
that side and this side,

404
00:35:52.873 --> 00:35:56.306
to make a baby basket.

405
00:36:01.410 --> 00:36:06.184
Sammy, did you make baskets
with Inkwel?


406
00:36:10.155 --> 00:36:11.727
Yeah,

407
00:36:11.727 --> 00:36:13.224
but...

408
00:36:23.201 --> 00:36:24.334
Yeah.

409
00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:28.843
Uh, let’s get back.

410
00:36:28.843 --> 00:36:29.778
Okay.

411
00:36:29.778 --> 00:36:32.210
That’s how we do that this way.

412
00:36:40.987 --> 00:36:42.352
How about your dad?

413
00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:46.389
Does he ever come?

414
00:36:49.897 --> 00:36:52.834
Well, that sucks.

415
00:37:05.342 --> 00:37:06.848
Do you, uh...

416
00:37:06.848 --> 00:37:09.884
do you want this pain
to continue?


417
00:37:11.315 --> 00:37:12.250
Think about it.

418
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:14.120
You’re all that’s left
of the family,


419
00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.924
and you’ve only felt pain.

420
00:37:16.924 --> 00:37:19.993
That’s not what family
should be, man.


421
00:37:22.161 --> 00:37:23.360
Do you think it’s gonna...

422
00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.065
do you think it’s just
gonna magically disappear?


423
00:37:25.065 --> 00:37:26.769
No, it’s gonna keep going.

424
00:37:26.769 --> 00:37:30.037
It’s gonna keep going
for generations and generations,


425
00:37:30.037 --> 00:37:34.305
until someone
does something about it.


426
00:37:42.983 --> 00:37:44.447
You know, you...

427
00:37:44.447 --> 00:37:48.451
you can do something about it.

428
00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:52.521
Do something frickin’ brave
with your life.


429
00:38:23.123 --> 00:38:24.893
Hey, I thought
you were going to pick me up


430
00:38:24.893 --> 00:38:26.357
when you got back.

431
00:38:27.325 --> 00:38:29.360
I just got back this morning.

432
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.362
There was a big firebreak.

433
00:38:31.362 --> 00:38:34.233
How about you hand me
that half-inch over there?


434
00:38:40.041 --> 00:38:43.572
Uh, when I was at Etsu’s
yesterday...


435
00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:45.442
Come around here.

436
00:38:45.442 --> 00:38:47.850
Hold this light for me.

437
00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.544
- And, uh...
- Right here.


438
00:38:48.544 --> 00:38:50.480
...and loosen that, oh, yeah.

439
00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.085
I--

440
00:38:51.085 --> 00:38:52.515
Hold steady,
and pass me those pliers.


441
00:38:52.515 --> 00:38:54.890
Those ones, yup.

442
00:38:55.023 --> 00:38:56.519
And, like,
I asked her something,


443
00:38:56.519 --> 00:38:58.455
and I was wondering
if I could ask you--


444
00:39:02.393 --> 00:39:03.526
Listen.

445
00:39:03.526 --> 00:39:05.066
If you’re not going to help me,

446
00:39:05.066 --> 00:39:07.134
I’d rather do this alone.

447
00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.157
Hey, Tyler!

448
00:39:30.157 --> 00:39:33.325
We’ll go to the gun range
tomorrow?


449
00:39:33.325 --> 00:39:34.029
Nah.

450
00:39:34.029 --> 00:39:36.460
Thanks, Sammy.
I’m good.


451
00:40:03.058 --> 00:40:05.225
Hey, Gordon!

452
00:40:33.682 --> 00:40:36.124
Sammy, stay out of this.

453
00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.034
Stay out.

454
00:40:53.735 --> 00:40:56.012
I’m going to jump in.

455
00:40:58.443 --> 00:41:01.116
Well, that was anti-climactic.

456
00:41:01.984 --> 00:41:03.481
Hey, anybody here?

457
00:41:03.481 --> 00:41:05.120
Anybody?

458
00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.715
I’m walking away.

459
00:41:07.617 --> 00:41:09.223
I’m walking away.

460
00:41:11.291 --> 00:41:12.259
Hey, puppy.

461
00:41:12.259 --> 00:41:14.525
Hey, puppy,
you wanna be in my movie?


462
00:41:14.525 --> 00:41:15.196
Come on.

463
00:41:15.196 --> 00:41:20.300
I’ll pay you 15 bits of kibble.

464
00:41:42.157 --> 00:41:43.290
Hey, Mom,

465
00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:44.423
back again.

466
00:41:44.423 --> 00:41:46.260
Later than usual.

467
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:51.133
Uh, remember that kid
I told you about?


468
00:41:51.133 --> 00:41:52.398
Aaron?

469
00:41:52.398 --> 00:41:54.697
Yeah, I’ve gotten
a lot closer with him,


470
00:41:54.697 --> 00:41:55.434
and yeah,

471
00:41:55.434 --> 00:41:59.306
we’ve been doing
lots of stuff together, and...


472
00:41:59.306 --> 00:42:01.671
but he’s into other things.

473
00:42:01.671 --> 00:42:02.540
They’re not good things,

474
00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:05.642
but I do agree with him
about certain things,


475
00:42:05.642 --> 00:42:07.380
certain things about my life,

476
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.316
and, yeah...

477
00:42:09.316 --> 00:42:10.185
He makes me think

478
00:42:10.185 --> 00:42:13.749
I should be doing something more
or something, and...


479
00:42:13.749 --> 00:42:14.816
what if he’s...

480
00:42:14.816 --> 00:42:18.160
what if he’s right, you know?

481
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.591
Dad is still the same.

482
00:42:20.591 --> 00:42:24.232
You’re still not here, and...

483
00:42:24.232 --> 00:42:26.432
but...

484
00:42:26.432 --> 00:42:28.434
I love doing this.

485
00:42:28.434 --> 00:42:29.567
I really do.

486
00:42:29.567 --> 00:42:33.439
It’s like I can
keep people alive.


487
00:42:33.439 --> 00:42:34.407
It’s...

488
00:42:34.407 --> 00:42:36.739
it’s so wild.

489
00:42:36.739 --> 00:42:38.774
I can...

490
00:43:59.723 --> 00:44:01.461
Get outta here.

491
00:44:02.363 --> 00:44:03.628
Hey, s’up, Sammy?

492
00:44:03.628 --> 00:44:06.301
I’ve got a surprise for you.

493
00:44:06.301 --> 00:44:06.862
Oh yeah?

494
00:44:06.862 --> 00:44:08.567
I talked to the school.

495
00:44:08.567 --> 00:44:10.866
I got another screening
in the theatre.


496
00:44:10.866 --> 00:44:11.933
Thanks, Sammy.

497
00:44:11.933 --> 00:44:12.901
You betcha.

498
00:44:12.901 --> 00:44:13.605
It’s in the gym.

499
00:44:13.605 --> 00:44:15.574
We’re gonna set up
all the chairs and all.


500
00:44:15.574 --> 00:44:17.609
We’ll make it
like a real thing.


501
00:44:17.609 --> 00:44:18.709
A real theatre...

502
00:44:18.709 --> 00:44:21.712
You hear that, Dad?

503
00:44:22.515 --> 00:44:26.453
Do you think
you’ll be able to make it?


504
00:44:28.587 --> 00:44:29.852
I
-I don’t know.

505
00:44:29.852 --> 00:44:33.295
I’ll be away, I think,
on the fire line.


506
00:44:33.295 --> 00:44:35.792
Good thing your Aba
does what he does.


507
00:44:35.792 --> 00:44:39.202
He’s protecting
a lot of people.


508
00:44:39.202 --> 00:44:40.434
Yeah.

509
00:44:43.899 --> 00:44:47.342
I guess you don’t care.

510
00:44:47.342 --> 00:44:49.476
Okay.
I can try.


511
00:44:49.476 --> 00:44:50.642
For real?

512
00:44:50.642 --> 00:44:52.281
You’ve got a VIP coming.

513
00:44:52.281 --> 00:44:52.875
Oh, okay.

514
00:44:52.875 --> 00:44:54.217
You’ve got another movie,
don’t you?


515
00:44:54.217 --> 00:44:56.351
- Yeah, I think
I’ve got a couple.


516
00:44:56.351 --> 00:44:57.253
Thanks, Sammy!

517
00:44:57.253 --> 00:44:58.551
See you there, Dad!

518
00:45:05.855 --> 00:45:07.230
Hey.

519
00:45:08.231 --> 00:45:08.726
S’up?

520
00:45:08.726 --> 00:45:10.794
I never told you
where I lived.


521
00:45:10.794 --> 00:45:12.499
Yeah, you did.

522
00:45:12.499 --> 00:45:15.799
Did Sammy just say
you got a new screening?


523
00:45:15.799 --> 00:45:16.800
Oh, yeah, he did.

524
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.472
I think my dad’s coming.

525
00:45:18.472 --> 00:45:19.341
Beast!

526
00:45:19.341 --> 00:45:20.375
What’s the movie?

527
00:45:20.375 --> 00:45:21.376
Oh, well, it’s next week.

528
00:45:21.376 --> 00:45:24.610
I don’t have much time
to write anything new.


529
00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:26.711
Guess I might have to create
something new


530
00:45:26.711 --> 00:45:28.251
out of these guys again,

531
00:45:28.251 --> 00:45:29.978
and, um, I could probably
do a sequel,


532
00:45:29.978 --> 00:45:30.946
maybe even a prequel.

533
00:45:30.946 --> 00:45:32.651
We might have
some new people watching.


534
00:45:32.651 --> 00:45:34.422
That might not be a good idea--

535
00:45:34.422 --> 00:45:35.984
What about this?

536
00:45:37.524 --> 00:45:38.822
Uh, that’s, uh...

537
00:45:38.822 --> 00:45:40.362
that’s kind of personal.

538
00:45:40.362 --> 00:45:42.364
It’s kind of like my diary.

539
00:45:42.364 --> 00:45:42.925
Oh, I know.

540
00:45:42.925 --> 00:45:44.960
I should just stick
with what I’m good at.


541
00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.599
Yeah...

542
00:45:46.599 --> 00:45:47.501
No.

543
00:45:47.501 --> 00:45:48.535
What do you mean, no?

544
00:45:48.535 --> 00:45:50.306
This... this is...

545
00:45:50.306 --> 00:45:51.835
Man, it’s trash.

546
00:45:52.638 --> 00:45:53.804
What?

547
00:45:53.804 --> 00:45:54.541
Tyler...

548
00:45:54.541 --> 00:45:55.905
this is incredible.

549
00:45:55.905 --> 00:45:57.346
But it’s not even a movie.

550
00:45:57.346 --> 00:45:58.974
It’s just something
I cut up last night.


551
00:45:58.974 --> 00:45:59.876
It’s just...

552
00:45:59.876 --> 00:46:01.680
There we go.

553
00:46:06.048 --> 00:46:08.291
Listen, man.

554
00:46:08.291 --> 00:46:11.294
This right here?

555
00:46:11.294 --> 00:46:13.989
What you have in your computer

556
00:46:13.989 --> 00:46:15.958
is something special.

557
00:46:15.958 --> 00:46:16.959
None of this...

558
00:46:16.959 --> 00:46:19.698
none of this shit.

559
00:46:25.572 --> 00:46:28.971
You want to make something
people will remember,


560
00:46:28.971 --> 00:46:31.842
something people
will tell others about?


561
00:46:31.842 --> 00:46:36.385
Something that’ll stay alive
after we’re gone?


562
00:46:37.452 --> 00:46:40.422
You need to give them
something...


563
00:46:40.422 --> 00:46:41.885
from here.

564
00:46:44.756 --> 00:46:45.988
Come on.

565
00:46:45.988 --> 00:46:48.727
You can do this.

566
00:46:48.727 --> 00:46:51.466
We can do this.

567
00:47:06.514 --> 00:47:09.484
"A new film by Tyler M,
with real people.


568
00:47:09.484 --> 00:47:13.818
Next Friday, 7:00 p.m.,
in a real theatre."


569
00:47:18.087 --> 00:47:20.627
Close enough.

570
00:47:33.937 --> 00:47:35.642
Come to my new film, man,
it’s about a real person.


571
00:47:35.642 --> 00:47:39.481
I mean, it’s about my family,
and how it relates to me.


572
00:47:39.481 --> 00:47:41.044
It’s gonna be...
it’s gonna be cool.


573
00:47:41.044 --> 00:47:42.517
Lots of people
are gonna be there.


574
00:47:42.517 --> 00:47:44.651
See you there.

575
00:47:48.919 --> 00:47:49.854
Tyler...

576
00:47:49.854 --> 00:47:50.723
Tyler, you’re flying

577
00:47:50.723 --> 00:47:52.121
’Cause you know time is desired

578
00:47:52.121 --> 00:47:53.891
Don’t wanna burn in a fire!

579
00:47:56.125 --> 00:47:58.434
Young grasshopper!

580
00:48:26.858 --> 00:48:29.191
Hey, tell Sherry
congratulations.


581
00:48:29.191 --> 00:48:30.697
I will.

582
00:48:44.909 --> 00:48:48.814
So, Tyler, could you tell me
a little bit more


583
00:48:48.814 --> 00:48:50.113
about your new film?

584
00:48:50.113 --> 00:48:52.181
Well, what makes
this film different


585
00:48:52.181 --> 00:48:53.456
is that I’m using real people.

586
00:48:53.456 --> 00:48:55.623
No more
of these damn cardboards.


587
00:48:55.623 --> 00:48:58.494
It’s pure little-kid poop.
Pure poop.


588
00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:53.945
Hey, Gordon.

589
00:49:53.945 --> 00:49:56.212
What have you told him?

590
00:49:56.212 --> 00:49:58.521
I didn’t say anything.

591
00:49:58.983 --> 00:50:01.052
What the hell is this about?

592
00:50:03.724 --> 00:50:06.595
I wanted him to make a Western.

593
00:50:06.595 --> 00:50:08.257
This is not funny, Sammy.

594
00:50:08.257 --> 00:50:09.730
What have you told him?

595
00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:10.830
I’m just taking him out.

596
00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:12.898
I’m doing the things
you should be doing.


597
00:50:12.898 --> 00:50:15.231
You don’t know what it’s like.

598
00:50:15.231 --> 00:50:16.199
I was there!

599
00:50:16.199 --> 00:50:17.101
We were all there!

600
00:50:17.101 --> 00:50:18.937
You’re his Aba.

601
00:50:18.937 --> 00:50:20.038
You should protect him.

602
00:50:20.038 --> 00:50:21.006
You should tell him.

603
00:50:21.006 --> 00:50:24.042
I can’t even look at him.

604
00:50:25.142 --> 00:50:27.847
He looks just like her.

605
00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.114
Hey!

606
00:50:31.752 --> 00:50:34.283
Shame on you guys.

607
00:50:45.832 --> 00:50:46.734
Okay, boys, safety first.

608
00:50:46.734 --> 00:50:49.572
We’re gonna wanna
maintain eye contact.


609
00:50:49.572 --> 00:50:51.102
We’re not too worried
about the weather today,


610
00:50:51.102 --> 00:50:54.303
but be worried about the hoses,
like, running through,


611
00:50:54.303 --> 00:50:55.842
don’t wanna damage them.

612
00:50:55.842 --> 00:50:58.713
Um, watch your footing...

613
00:51:27.138 --> 00:51:31.142
I can’t dream.

614
00:51:36.279 --> 00:51:41.020
Something keeps me

615
00:51:45.387 --> 00:51:47.389
Locked

616
00:51:47.389 --> 00:51:49.764
and bodied

617
00:51:49.764 --> 00:51:52.295
pawing at the edge...

618
00:52:15.955 --> 00:52:19.157
It’s weird here.

619
00:52:23.260 --> 00:52:27.670
Choirs threaten...

620
00:53:45.276 --> 00:53:47.344
Gord, you all right, bud?

621
00:53:47.344 --> 00:53:48.213
You okay?

622
00:53:48.213 --> 00:53:48.883
Yeah.

623
00:53:48.883 --> 00:53:49.884
- Wanna get
a pillow for his head?


624
00:53:49.884 --> 00:53:51.447
- Can you grab some water?
- I’m okay, I’m okay.


625
00:53:51.447 --> 00:53:54.021
- You good?
- I’m okay...


626
00:53:54.021 --> 00:53:55.857
I’m okay.

627
00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:11.170
Gord, jump in the truck?

628
00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:13.403
I’m gonna walk.

629
00:54:13.403 --> 00:54:15.207
Okay.

630
00:54:20.047 --> 00:54:21.048
Finish the sound?

631
00:54:21.048 --> 00:54:23.413
Yeah, I exported it
this morning.


632
00:54:24.348 --> 00:54:25.481
Wow, man.

633
00:54:25.481 --> 00:54:28.956
I can’t believe we did it.

634
00:54:29.419 --> 00:54:31.959
I don’t know.

635
00:54:34.797 --> 00:54:37.460
What’s up, man?

636
00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:39.165
I don’t know, it’s...

637
00:54:39.165 --> 00:54:42.201
I can’t even tell you
if it’s good or not.


638
00:54:42.201 --> 00:54:45.369
That’s because you’ve been
staring at it too long.


639
00:54:45.369 --> 00:54:47.173
Nah, it’s not because of that.

640
00:54:47.173 --> 00:54:47.810
I just...

641
00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:52.376
I just really don’t know
how it’s going to play out, man.


642
00:54:52.376 --> 00:54:56.083
I wanted you to give them
something real.


643
00:54:56.083 --> 00:54:56.885
Yeah.

644
00:54:56.885 --> 00:54:57.952
Well, if they don’t like it,

645
00:54:57.952 --> 00:55:00.120
then I guess they don’t like me.

646
00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:03.826
Well, at least
you’ll know your answer.


647
00:55:03.826 --> 00:55:05.894
What?

648
00:55:05.894 --> 00:55:10.229
If this screening goes bad...

649
00:55:15.498 --> 00:55:21.042
are you gonna be able
to handle the pain?


650
00:55:21.174 --> 00:55:24.342
I’m sure it’ll be fine,
though, man.


651
00:55:27.378 --> 00:55:29.215
I hope so.

652
00:55:29.215 --> 00:55:31.250
I couldn’t have done it
without you.


653
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:32.482
I know.

654
00:55:34.055 --> 00:55:36.618
Where are we going?

655
00:56:07.121 --> 00:56:09.222
I saw
this figure in the water,


656
00:56:09.222 --> 00:56:12.522
and I was kind of scared
to come back here again,


657
00:56:12.522 --> 00:56:14.062
and yeah...

658
00:56:14.062 --> 00:56:15.393
and since we’re kind of close,

659
00:56:15.393 --> 00:56:16.899
I thought you could...

660
00:56:16.899 --> 00:56:20.035
I could show it to you.

661
00:56:26.008 --> 00:56:28.043
What’s up?

662
00:56:28.043 --> 00:56:29.671
I can’t.

663
00:56:29.671 --> 00:56:32.641
Come on, let’s go.

664
00:56:37.019 --> 00:56:39.219
She’s here.

665
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:45.060
Hey!

666
00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:46.325
Don’t go near that water!

667
00:56:46.325 --> 00:56:49.130
Get away from that water!

668
00:56:49.130 --> 00:56:51.627
We’re leaving! Come on!

669
00:57:06.477 --> 00:57:08.512
I don’t want you going there.

670
00:57:08.512 --> 00:57:09.985
You hear me?

671
00:57:09.985 --> 00:57:11.614
Why not?
It’s just a pond.


672
00:57:11.614 --> 00:57:12.450
Tyler, you listen to me.

673
00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:14.089
Don’t you ever
go there again, okay?


674
00:57:14.089 --> 00:57:15.255
Why are you acting so weird?

675
00:57:15.255 --> 00:57:18.192
How are you gonna know
if I go there again, huh?


676
00:57:18.192 --> 00:57:18.961
What?

677
00:57:18.961 --> 00:57:19.655
Because you’re never around.

678
00:57:19.655 --> 00:57:21.228
You’re gonna have to, like,
put a tracker on me.


679
00:57:21.228 --> 00:57:23.966
Tyler, I don’t want you
to go there--


680
00:57:23.966 --> 00:57:26.167
I don’t care what you want!

681
00:57:26.167 --> 00:57:27.366
You’re never here!

682
00:57:27.366 --> 00:57:28.334
You’re always working.

683
00:57:28.334 --> 00:57:30.303
What are you doing tomorrow?

684
00:57:30.303 --> 00:57:31.172
Working.

685
00:57:31.172 --> 00:57:34.703
Do you even know
what’s happening tomorrow?


686
00:57:34.703 --> 00:57:38.014
It’s my screening, Dad.

687
00:57:46.253 --> 00:57:47.221
Tyler, listen.

688
00:57:47.221 --> 00:57:48.651
No, you listen!

689
00:57:48.651 --> 00:57:50.719
Etsu and Sammy, they raised me.

690
00:57:50.719 --> 00:57:53.425
They’re the ones who nagged me
to do my homework,


691
00:57:53.425 --> 00:57:54.723
made me eat my vegetables,

692
00:57:54.723 --> 00:57:56.164
made me take my vitamins.

693
00:57:56.164 --> 00:57:56.659
They’re the ones

694
00:57:56.659 --> 00:57:59.101
who’re supporting me
with my filming.


695
00:57:59.101 --> 00:58:00.201
Do you even see me?

696
00:58:00.201 --> 00:58:01.730
I’m right here, Dad.
I’m right here!


697
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:04.403
If I died tomorrow,
you wouldn’t even know.


698
00:58:04.403 --> 00:58:07.274
You wouldn’t even care.

699
00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.354
Did Mom even love me?

700
00:58:28.328 --> 00:58:30.165
Was it my fault?

701
00:58:30.165 --> 00:58:33.135
Was it my fault she left?

702
00:59:52.808 --> 00:59:56.812
You ever get sick
of this place?


703
01:00:05.623 --> 01:00:07.295
I don’t know.

704
01:00:07.295 --> 01:00:09.297
I’ve lived here my whole life.

705
01:00:09.297 --> 01:00:12.267
That’s what I’m talking about.

706
01:00:12.267 --> 01:00:13.565
What?

707
01:00:13.565 --> 01:00:15.567
Your whole life.

708
01:00:15.567 --> 01:00:18.207
Don’t you ever get sick of it?

709
01:00:18.207 --> 01:00:20.407
Don’t you want to do
something with it?


710
01:00:20.407 --> 01:00:21.540
Aren’t I?

711
01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:23.212
I’m making movies and...

712
01:00:23.212 --> 01:00:26.479
lots of people show up to them.

713
01:00:26.479 --> 01:00:27.282
Oh, yeah?

714
01:00:27.282 --> 01:00:31.847
How many people showed up
to your last screening, then?


715
01:00:35.818 --> 01:00:37.721
Three.

716
01:00:38.689 --> 01:00:40.592
Three.

717
01:00:41.296 --> 01:00:43.661
Listen, man.

718
01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:47.434
What if your life ended today?

719
01:00:47.434 --> 01:00:48.831
Just ended.

720
01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:51.801
What would you have wished
you’d done?


721
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:54.342
Like, a real cool movie,
I guess.


722
01:00:54.342 --> 01:00:54.870
I don’t know.

723
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:57.675
Think. I want to know.

724
01:00:58.379 --> 01:01:02.515
I want to know
what you’re afraid of.


725
01:01:04.715 --> 01:01:07.949
Give me your fear.

726
01:01:09.357 --> 01:01:12.723
I can’t help but think

727
01:01:12.723 --> 01:01:17.266
that they all know something
that I don’t.


728
01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:20.929
Makes me feel so alone.

729
01:01:25.208 --> 01:01:27.606
I can help you.

730
01:01:27.606 --> 01:01:30.477
How?

731
01:01:30.477 --> 01:01:33.645
I can make you a promise.

732
01:01:36.351 --> 01:01:37.319
I can promise

733
01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:41.884
that if your world
falls apart...


734
01:01:43.259 --> 01:01:45.789
we can leave it together.

735
01:02:01.409 --> 01:02:02.641
Is it raining?

736
01:02:02.641 --> 01:02:03.477
Sorry, man, I gotta go.

737
01:02:03.477 --> 01:02:06.513
I don’t want to get the camera
too wet.


738
01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:06.897
Where are we going?

739
01:04:06.897 --> 01:04:09.471
You have
to close your eyes a little.


740
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:10.703
I know you’re going to love it.

741
01:04:10.703 --> 01:04:14.476
We’re going to make this
our spot.


742
01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:17.743
Oh, that’s so sweet.

743
01:04:18.414 --> 01:04:21.780
I got you, I got you.

744
01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:23.650
Ready?

745
01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:24.948
Yeah.

746
01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:27.654
Now you can look.

747
01:06:17.863 --> 01:06:21.230
He’s going to need you now.

748
01:07:32.707 --> 01:07:34.171
Hey, everyone.

749
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:40.210
First of all, seche’enalyagh
for coming out tonight.


750
01:07:43.015 --> 01:07:45.182
I really appreciate
all of your support,


751
01:07:45.182 --> 01:07:48.053
going back to my old movies.

752
01:07:48.954 --> 01:07:50.989
I know I borrow a lot,

753
01:07:50.989 --> 01:07:54.257
and I broke a lot, but...

754
01:07:54.257 --> 01:07:57.194
I really am sorry
for that toaster.


755
01:07:57.194 --> 01:07:59.229
I really am.

756
01:08:05.268 --> 01:08:06.104
The point is,

757
01:08:06.104 --> 01:08:09.206
I hope that you all enjoy
this one the most.


758
01:08:09.206 --> 01:08:11.175
It’s the most personal.

759
01:08:11.175 --> 01:08:13.144
It’s the most important film
I’ve done,


760
01:08:13.144 --> 01:08:14.376
and it really is a film

761
01:08:14.376 --> 01:08:16.916
that I think couldn’t have
existed without me,


762
01:08:16.916 --> 01:08:19.853
and I don’t think
I could have existed without it.


763
01:08:38.004 --> 01:08:38.839
Without further ado,

764
01:08:38.839 --> 01:08:41.842
I present to you
"My Mother and Me."


765
01:08:59.190 --> 01:09:00.663
Hi, Mom.

766
01:09:00.663 --> 01:09:05.328
Wow, it’s like the first time
I ever said that.


767
01:09:05.328 --> 01:09:07.670
I saw you.

768
01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:09.365
I don’t know why.

769
01:09:09.365 --> 01:09:11.202
It just felt...

770
01:09:11.202 --> 01:09:14.073
it felt different.

771
01:09:14.073 --> 01:09:16.976
Seeing us all together.

772
01:09:16.976 --> 01:09:20.947
The three of us,

773
01:09:20.947 --> 01:09:22.246
but...

774
01:09:22.246 --> 01:09:25.315
nobody will tell me about you.

775
01:09:26.755 --> 01:09:28.856
Dad is still the same.

776
01:09:28.856 --> 01:09:32.355
You’re still not here, and...

777
01:09:32.355 --> 01:09:33.422
Did I...

778
01:09:33.422 --> 01:09:35.896
Did I do something?

779
01:09:35.896 --> 01:09:39.197
Did I do something wrong?

780
01:09:40.363 --> 01:09:41.836
Where are you going?

781
01:09:41.836 --> 01:09:43.706
What’s going on?

782
01:09:43.706 --> 01:09:45.104
This is my mom!

783
01:09:45.104 --> 01:09:48.074
This is my mom and me!

784
01:09:48.074 --> 01:09:49.405
That’s not you.

785
01:09:49.405 --> 01:09:53.343
That’s your brother.

786
01:12:26.463 --> 01:12:29.598
I can’t take it!

787
01:12:30.335 --> 01:12:31.270
I can’t take it!

788
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:34.405
I can’t take it!

789
01:12:34.405 --> 01:12:37.573
I can’t take it.

790
01:12:44.316 --> 01:12:46.384
You ready?

791
01:13:20.451 --> 01:13:24.026
Tyler!

792
01:13:25.324 --> 01:13:28.360
Get back here!

793
01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:30.395
Don’t go after her!

794
01:13:32.364 --> 01:13:35.268
Inkwel,
where are you going?


795
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:41.241
Mom!

796
01:13:48.512 --> 01:13:51.020
Mom, where are you going?

797
01:13:58.324 --> 01:14:00.491
Mom!

798
01:14:32.754 --> 01:14:34.756
Dad?

799
01:14:36.999 --> 01:14:38.562
Mom?

800
01:15:26.379 --> 01:15:28.711
Mom! Dad! There’s a fire!

801
01:15:28.711 --> 01:15:30.086
There’s a fire!

802
01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.168
Stay here.

803
01:16:12.392 --> 01:16:13.723
The crib...

804
01:16:21.236 --> 01:16:23.634
Look at how handsome he is.

805
01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.869
Hi.

806
01:16:27.869 --> 01:16:31.246
Yeah, there we go... yeah!

807
01:16:32.742 --> 01:16:34.381
Elhixidlin.

808
01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:35.679
Where the rivers meet.

809
01:16:38.385 --> 01:16:39.848
You need to see this.

810
01:16:48.758 --> 01:16:52.234
Trish?

811
01:16:52.234 --> 01:16:54.368
You need to stop doing this.

812
01:16:57.437 --> 01:17:01.243
I’m not
going to take this anymore.


813
01:17:07.843 --> 01:17:09.284
You hear me?

814
01:17:09.284 --> 01:17:12.452
You can’t do this anymore.

815
01:17:16.852 --> 01:17:20.163
We have Tyler.

816
01:17:20.163 --> 01:17:22.627
It’s our second chance.

817
01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.241
Enough.

818
01:17:32.802 --> 01:17:34.507
Enough!

819
01:17:39.941 --> 01:17:44.319
This is probably what got him
killed in the first place.


820
01:17:50.919 --> 01:17:53.691
He died...

821
01:17:54.395 --> 01:17:59.565
because you didn’t save him.

822
01:19:23.781 --> 01:19:25.047
I got him!

823
01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:26.619
I got him!

824
01:19:26.619 --> 01:19:28.720
I got... I got him.

825
01:19:58.684 --> 01:19:59.850
Hey, Son.

826
01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:01.017
It’s me.

827
01:20:01.017 --> 01:20:02.655
It’s me...

828
01:20:04.426 --> 01:20:05.790
Easy...

829
01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:09.332
There, Son.

830
01:20:23.379 --> 01:20:25.876
I’ve gotta get you
a blanket, okay?


831
01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:28.450
Out of the truck.

832
01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:30.419
Okay?

833
01:20:30.947 --> 01:20:33.620
I promise I’ll be back.

834
01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.051
Okay?

835
01:20:36.392 --> 01:20:37.525
Okay.

836
01:20:38.021 --> 01:20:38.955
Just breathe.

837
01:20:42.893 --> 01:20:44.565
Okay?

838
01:20:54.773 --> 01:20:57.908
Why’d you run?

839
01:20:57.908 --> 01:21:00.482
Aaron, listen...

840
01:21:04.816 --> 01:21:07.819
Dad saved me.

841
01:21:08.589 --> 01:21:10.921
Why didn’t he save me?

842
01:21:10.921 --> 01:21:13.122
He tried to, Aaron.

843
01:21:14.661 --> 01:21:16.531
And Mom?

844
01:21:16.531 --> 01:21:18.863
She tried too.

845
01:21:20.469 --> 01:21:22.768
I saw it.

846
01:21:23.934 --> 01:21:25.672
No.

847
01:21:25.672 --> 01:21:27.410
Aaron, listen.

848
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:28.972
You’re not real.

849
01:21:29.874 --> 01:21:30.974
No.

850
01:21:44.823 --> 01:21:46.627
Mom.

851
01:21:53.997 --> 01:21:58.200
I just wanted a chance.

852
01:21:58.200 --> 01:21:59.475
Aaron...

853
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:04.711
It doesn’t mean
you can take your brother’s.


854
01:22:09.013 --> 01:22:14.018
Your spirit must move on.

855
01:22:47.886 --> 01:22:50.955
I thought I could save you.

856
01:22:57.632 --> 01:22:59.865
Tyler...

857
01:23:01.131 --> 01:23:05.904
I’m so proud...

858
01:23:05.904 --> 01:23:08.171
of who you are.

859
01:23:09.271 --> 01:23:14.111
You deserve to know
what happened.


860
01:23:18.082 --> 01:23:19.819
It’s okay, Mom.

861
01:23:19.819 --> 01:23:21.085
I see.

862
01:23:21.085 --> 01:23:22.657
I see it now.

863
01:23:22.657 --> 01:23:25.726
It wasn’t anyone’s fault.

864
01:23:29.664 --> 01:23:31.699
I understand.

865
01:24:02.598 --> 01:24:04.996
I love you, Mom.

866
01:24:08.264 --> 01:24:09.968
Hi.

867
01:24:09.968 --> 01:24:11.805
Here.

868
01:24:11.805 --> 01:24:13.675
Here you go.

869
01:24:18.779 --> 01:24:19.846
You ready?

870
01:24:19.846 --> 01:24:22.311
Let’s go right to the truck.

871
01:24:23.850 --> 01:24:25.215
Careful.

872
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:07.960
I have a claim in this spot.

873
01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.732
You’re gonna have to move on.

874
01:25:11.733 --> 01:25:13.230
This is Sammy’s spot.

875
01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:14.670
I don’t think so.

876
01:25:14.670 --> 01:25:16.639
You’d better get moving.

877
01:26:05.688 --> 01:26:07.350
90, take two.

878
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:09.418
Mark it.

879
01:26:11.288 --> 01:26:12.728
Let’s do it again.

880
01:26:12.728 --> 01:26:14.423
Goddammit, let’s do it again.

881
01:26:14.423 --> 01:26:15.226
No, it’s okay, Sammy.

882
01:26:15.226 --> 01:26:18.701
We’ll do some reshoots
if we need to, okay?


883
01:26:18.701 --> 01:26:19.230
So...

884
01:26:19.230 --> 01:26:20.165
see you next time,

885
01:26:20.165 --> 01:26:21.836
and, uh, that’s a wrap.

886
01:26:21.836 --> 01:26:22.431
Let’s go!

887
01:26:22.431 --> 01:26:23.970
- Copy that!
That’s a wrap!


888
01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:25.335
That’s a cut, guys.

889
01:26:25.335 --> 01:26:26.237
That was great, Son.

890
01:26:26.237 --> 01:26:27.106
- That was perfect.
- Yeah.


891
01:26:27.106 --> 01:26:29.009
What was that master shot
that you were doing?


892
01:26:29.009 --> 01:26:29.877
Oh, it was, like, a...

893
01:26:29.877 --> 01:26:31.077
I framed it pretty good,
didn’t I?


894
01:26:31.077 --> 01:26:31.780
Yeah, I liked it.

895
01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:34.113
Whatever you were doing,
it looked natural.


896
01:26:34.113 --> 01:26:34.849
I think, you know,

897
01:26:34.849 --> 01:26:36.818
maybe we should get
a crew shot, okay?


898
01:26:36.818 --> 01:26:37.786
You want to get a crew shot?

899
01:26:37.786 --> 01:26:38.985
Yeah, I think that’d be good.

900
01:26:38.985 --> 01:26:39.722
Hey, everybody!

901
01:26:39.722 --> 01:26:41.856
Everybody, come into
the crew shot picture.


902
01:26:41.856 --> 01:26:43.287
I’m going to take
a picture of you guys.


903
01:26:43.287 --> 01:26:44.925
- Okay, guys, let’s get
a crew shot photo right here!


904
01:26:44.925 --> 01:26:46.993
- You get in front, Son.
- Thanks, Dad.


905
01:26:46.993 --> 01:26:48.424
Bring it in, bring it in!

906
01:26:48.424 --> 01:26:50.393
Okay.

907
01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:53.099
Okay, guys. Yeah.

908
01:26:53.099 --> 01:26:56.036
Awesome. This looks great, guys.

909
01:26:57.004 --> 01:26:58.401
Give me money.

910
01:26:58.401 --> 01:26:59.808
Give me your money.

911
01:26:59.808 --> 01:27:02.075
I want to go gambling.

912
01:27:04.011 --> 01:27:05.814
Yeah! Perfect.

913
01:27:05.814 --> 01:27:07.476
Okay, here we go, guys.

914
01:31:33.412 --> 01:31:36.580
Oh, there’s a bingo
at John Louie’s.


915
01:31:37.416 --> 01:31:39.154
So, and then say,

916
01:31:39.154 --> 01:31:41.090
"If anybody
wants to go to bingo,


917
01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:42.388
you can leave now."

918
01:31:42.388 --> 01:31:46.689
And if anybody wanna bingo,
you can leave now.


919
01:31:46.689 --> 01:31:49.131
- Then say,
"Get out of here!"


920
01:31:49.131 --> 01:31:51.364
Get outta here!
