1
00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:53.948
Richard, don't go out too far.

2
00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:56.003
Em's a fraidy cat!

3
00:02:56.167 --> 00:02:57.885
Richard! Emmeline!

4
00:02:59.628 --> 00:03:01.744
Come back here this minute.

5
00:03:01.922 --> 00:03:03.435
And be careful.

6
00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:06.984
What's gotten into you, Richard?

7
00:03:07.178 --> 00:03:10.090
Bad enough to endanger yourself,
but to encourage Emmeline...


8
00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:11.819
I'm sorry, Father.

9
00:03:11.974 --> 00:03:14.125
I know you want to have fun.

10
00:03:14.937 --> 00:03:18.930
All I'm trying to do is get us all
to San Francisco in one piece.


11
00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.871
Will Mommy be coming to San Francisco?

12
00:03:22.611 --> 00:03:24.249
I don't believe so, Richard.

13
00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:26.714
I told you. Once they go to heaven...

14
00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:29.865
they don't come back.
Isn't that right, Uncle Arthur?


15
00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:32.193
My mommy and daddy haven't come back.

16
00:03:32.372 --> 00:03:34.761
Because God wants them to stay...

17
00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.188
and do his work
and wait for the day...

18
00:03:37.376 --> 00:03:40.448
when you will take
the long voyage to see them.


19
00:03:40.671 --> 00:03:42.343
When will that be?

20
00:03:42.882 --> 00:03:44.554
When you've lived a full life...

21
00:03:44.717 --> 00:03:46.867
and experienced all
that it has to offer.


22
00:03:47.053 --> 00:03:48.168
Look!

23
00:03:53.017 --> 00:03:54.928
Father, what are they called?

24
00:03:55.103 --> 00:03:56.092
Sharks.

25
00:03:56.229 --> 00:04:00.269
I wish I had a hook. I'd pull 'em aboard
and the cook would fry 'em for dinner.


26
00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.086
Captain, do you know
there's a fog bank coming in?


27
00:04:32.725 --> 00:04:34.477
I'm aware of that fact, sir.

28
00:04:34.645 --> 00:04:37.682
I heard one of the men say
those storms rounding the cape...


29
00:04:37.898 --> 00:04:39.809
pushed us far west of our course.

30
00:04:39.983 --> 00:04:43.738
That's right, sir.
Last night's celestial puts us about here.


31
00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:55.845
Richard, what are you looking at?

32
00:05:00.047 --> 00:05:02.322
They don't have any clothes on.

33
00:05:05.552 --> 00:05:09.784
What the hell are you two doing here?
I'll teach you, bucko!


34
00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:11.915
Come here.

35
00:05:13.602 --> 00:05:15.240
Don't you dare hurt him.

36
00:05:16.814 --> 00:05:18.611
You want a hiding, too, do you?

37
00:05:18.774 --> 00:05:20.969
- Fire!
- Fire?


38
00:05:21.945 --> 00:05:23.378
Did somebody say "fire"?

39
00:05:26.282 --> 00:05:28.716
Man the pumps.

40
00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.396
- Button.
- Yes, sir?


41
00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.896
Take the children and Mr. Lestrange
and row them away from the ship.


42
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:36.877
Come on.

43
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:39.274
Mr. Lestrange.

44
00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:42.701
There's blasting powder in that hold.
I saw them load it.


45
00:05:45.928 --> 00:05:47.964
Keep moving!

46
00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.156
Come on, will you?

47
00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.195
Come on, you.

48
00:05:59.317 --> 00:06:00.147
Uncle Arthur!

49
00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.752
Richard! Emmeline!

50
00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.777
- This way, Lestrange.
- The children!


51
00:06:04.947 --> 00:06:07.745
They've already taken their leave.
Follow me, sir.


52
00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:12.827
No, there is no more room.

53
00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:14.351
Lower away!

54
00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.184
Abandon ship!

55
00:06:25.344 --> 00:06:26.823
Don't explode yet!

56
00:06:31.684 --> 00:06:32.753
Further.

57
00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:35.544
What's happening? I can't see.

58
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.204
- What was that?
- The ship. Cover your faces.


59
00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:43.297
Richard!

60
00:06:44.489 --> 00:06:45.763
Emmeline!

61
00:06:46.574 --> 00:06:48.007
Uncle Arthur!

62
00:06:48.536 --> 00:06:49.605
There they are!

63
00:06:49.745 --> 00:06:50.894
Where?

64
00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:52.273
Captain, over here.

65
00:06:52.414 --> 00:06:53.450
Richard!

66
00:06:54.041 --> 00:06:55.713
Hello.

67
00:06:56.878 --> 00:06:58.072
Father!

68
00:06:58.712 --> 00:07:00.782
Don't go shouting both at once.

69
00:07:01.466 --> 00:07:03.536
I won't know which way to steer.

70
00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:06.733
Longboat, ahoy! 
Where are you?

71
00:07:12.894 --> 00:07:15.124
Hello!

72
00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:20.345
Father!

73
00:07:29.244 --> 00:07:30.359
Gone.

74
00:07:37.462 --> 00:07:38.895
Lord, help us.

75
00:08:20.464 --> 00:08:21.659
Where is Father?

76
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.159
What is your name?

77
00:08:25.303 --> 00:08:28.818
Paddy Button. Now, belay your questions.
Can't you see I'm busy?


78
00:08:30.433 --> 00:08:32.469
Damn it. No food or water.

79
00:08:35.022 --> 00:08:37.900
That's Chopin. 
I can play it on the piano.

80
00:08:43.406 --> 00:08:45.874
Mr. Button, can I ask you a question?

81
00:08:46.324 --> 00:08:47.313
Yes.

82
00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:49.089
Are you a pirate?

83
00:08:56.419 --> 00:08:57.818
I'm thirsty.

84
00:08:59.255 --> 00:09:00.483
Me, too.

85
00:09:01.716 --> 00:09:02.990
Listen...

86
00:09:03.634 --> 00:09:06.433
you'll hear it hiss
when it touches the water.


87
00:09:08.516 --> 00:09:10.746
- You hear it?
- I think so.


88
00:09:10.935 --> 00:09:12.766
I don't hear anything.

89
00:09:13.395 --> 00:09:16.751
Listen harder.
It must be fairly boilin' by now.


90
00:09:17.775 --> 00:09:19.254
There. Do you hear it?

91
00:09:19.402 --> 00:09:21.996
I hear it. Don't
you hear it now, Em?

92
00:09:22.196 --> 00:09:24.027
I think so.

93
00:09:24.824 --> 00:09:26.143
Yes, I hear it.

94
00:09:59.069 --> 00:10:00.627
I smell flowers.

95
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.793
Flowers?

96
00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:13.186
Mr. Button! Richard! Look!

97
00:10:17.212 --> 00:10:18.531
It's land!

98
00:10:19.047 --> 00:10:20.275
Land!

99
00:10:20.674 --> 00:10:23.666
We're saved.
I would never have believed it.


100
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.954
Where are we?

101
00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:49.772
Nirvana, that's where we are. No more
"yes, sir," "no, sir," for Paddy Button.


102
00:11:50.894 --> 00:11:53.931
No more breaking my back
over a stinkin' stove.


103
00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:57.896
Will Father be coming to fetch us?

104
00:11:58.068 --> 00:11:59.467
Come on, let's look around.

105
00:12:24.722 --> 00:12:26.360
Listen.

106
00:12:28.975 --> 00:12:30.294
Come on.

107
00:12:35.565 --> 00:12:36.884
I knew it.

108
00:12:39.778 --> 00:12:41.097
It's lovely.

109
00:12:41.655 --> 00:12:44.011
Water.

110
00:12:52.542 --> 00:12:54.533
Down there! Look out below!

111
00:13:27.537 --> 00:13:30.496
Mr. Button, there's a barrel over here...

112
00:13:30.707 --> 00:13:34.302
with funny stuff in it
that smells like the Captain's breath.


113
00:13:34.878 --> 00:13:36.675
The Captain's breath?

114
00:13:42.011 --> 00:13:43.569
It's rum.

115
00:13:44.597 --> 00:13:46.315
Sweet Jesus.

116
00:13:49.935 --> 00:13:52.927
Look what a funny thing I found.
It's got holes in it.


117
00:13:53.522 --> 00:13:56.241
Give me that. Where did you get it?

118
00:14:00.238 --> 00:14:02.388
- What was it?
- We'd better get out of here.


119
00:14:02.573 --> 00:14:04.165
There's a bunch of them up there.

120
00:14:04.325 --> 00:14:06.441
Come on, let's get out of here.

121
00:14:06.827 --> 00:14:08.340
Hurry it up, will you?

122
00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.120
I don't see Father's boat.

123
00:14:22.761 --> 00:14:26.231
No, not yet. Maybe he'll be along later.

124
00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:29.294
Maybe not.

125
00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:36.480
Take them things out of your mouth!

126
00:14:36.652 --> 00:14:39.371
Open your mouth!
Take them out of your mouth!


127
00:14:39.571 --> 00:14:41.368
Spit them out! Go on!

128
00:14:43.866 --> 00:14:46.585
Don't cry. I ain't mad at you.

129
00:14:46.995 --> 00:14:48.781
If you eat them berries,
you'll go to sleep.


130
00:14:48.794 --> 00:14:50.590
You'll never wake up again.

131
00:14:50.832 --> 00:14:53.710
They're never-wake-up berries, you see?

132
00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.093
Just leave them berries alone. Come on.

133
00:15:02.386 --> 00:15:06.379
We had a cat once
that went to sleep and never woke up.


134
00:15:07.476 --> 00:15:09.865
Uncle Arthur said she was dead and buried.

135
00:15:10.062 --> 00:15:13.577
Mr. Button, do you think she ate
some of those berries?


136
00:15:14.065 --> 00:15:15.214
Maybe.

137
00:15:16.359 --> 00:15:19.317
What does it really mean, Paddy,
"dead and buried"?


138
00:15:20.197 --> 00:15:23.507
It means that they put you in the ground
and they cover you up.


139
00:15:23.742 --> 00:15:26.415
And you're dead and buried, do you see?

140
00:15:26.995 --> 00:15:29.589
Like Mrs. Jones' baby. Remember, Em?

141
00:15:30.082 --> 00:15:32.960
The doctor dug it
out of the cabbage patch.

142
00:15:33.335 --> 00:15:34.450
The cabbage patch?

143
00:15:34.586 --> 00:15:38.056
That's right.
But he took it back and planted it again.


144
00:15:38.298 --> 00:15:41.052
So it could grow
and turn into an angel.

145
00:15:41.386 --> 00:15:44.219
I got a trowel
and dug our cabbage patch all up.


146
00:15:44.431 --> 00:15:47.309
But there weren't any babies or any angels.

147
00:15:48.268 --> 00:15:49.621
Only worms.

148
00:15:57.235 --> 00:15:59.465
What's in them pictures, Richard?

149
00:15:59.654 --> 00:16:03.090
It's a story about these funny people
who get married.


150
00:16:03.534 --> 00:16:05.604
There is a saying under each one.

151
00:16:06.078 --> 00:16:07.591
Give us a look.

152
00:16:14.586 --> 00:16:15.701
Yeah.

153
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:21.340
Were you ever married, Paddy?

154
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.863
Seven times.

155
00:16:23.012 --> 00:16:27.245
Kids in every port from Callao to Macao.
Seventeen at the last count.


156
00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:30.460
Never set eyes on a single of them.

157
00:16:30.646 --> 00:16:32.125
Slanted-eyed little devils...

158
00:16:32.272 --> 00:16:36.026
black little devils,
even a couple of pink ones like you.


159
00:16:37.277 --> 00:16:39.074
And all with my eyes.

160
00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:44.569
Paddy, what's "subjugation"?

161
00:16:45.244 --> 00:16:47.963
Something I've been trying to avoid
all my life.


162
00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:53.927
Come back here. 
This ain't gonna hurt you.

163
00:16:54.378 --> 00:16:57.415
We don't want to go swimming!
We don't have our bathing costumes!


164
00:16:57.632 --> 00:16:59.384
To hell with your bathing costumes!

165
00:16:59.551 --> 00:17:01.940
You don't wear them
when you have a bath, do you?


166
00:17:02.137 --> 00:17:04.446
This isn't a bathtub. 
This is the ocean!

167
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.118
Ready, go. That's it.

168
00:17:25.286 --> 00:17:28.244
Whenever you see a ship,
you run down quick...


169
00:17:28.498 --> 00:17:31.490
and you light the signal fire.
Do you hear me?


170
00:17:33.795 --> 00:17:37.265
There's the rabbit hole...

171
00:17:39.468 --> 00:17:43.097
There's a fox, see. Pull it tight.
There's a knot. Do it.


172
00:17:54.109 --> 00:17:57.897
Run your finger up like that.
You shove that around under there.


173
00:18:09.124 --> 00:18:11.558
There you are. 
Put it there, shipmate.

174
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.472
Where'd you find that?

175
00:18:20.677 --> 00:18:23.794
I didn't find it.
I made it from the knots you taught me.


176
00:18:24.014 --> 00:18:26.130
You made it? Well...

177
00:18:27.393 --> 00:18:29.224
pity it's not a bit bigger.

178
00:18:29.395 --> 00:18:30.953
Let's go swimming.

179
00:18:31.105 --> 00:18:32.220
Yeah.

180
00:18:56.048 --> 00:18:59.597
Come back here and put your clothes on!

181
00:18:59.844 --> 00:19:02.483
I don't want to wear my old britches.

182
00:19:04.056 --> 00:19:08.447
It ain't proper to be
running around naked all the time.


183
00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:41.635
Alone at last.

184
00:20:46.373 --> 00:20:50.161
Richard, Emmeline,
I want you both to promise me something.


185
00:20:51.253 --> 00:20:54.325
I want you to promise me
that you will never, ever go over...


186
00:20:54.547 --> 00:20:56.617
to the other side of the island.

187
00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.153
Why, Paddy?

188
00:20:59.511 --> 00:21:02.230
Why? Because I tell you, that's why!

189
00:21:02.722 --> 00:21:05.236
There's nasty things go on over there, see?

190
00:21:05.642 --> 00:21:07.712
Vile, evil, sinister things.

191
00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.589
Like what?

192
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:11.607
Yes, Mr. Button, like what?

193
00:21:11.774 --> 00:21:14.732
Well, for a start,
that's where the bogeyman lives.


194
00:21:14.943 --> 00:21:16.296
The bogeyman?

195
00:21:16.445 --> 00:21:19.482
That's right. And you know what happens
when the bogeyman...


196
00:21:19.699 --> 00:21:22.577
gets his hands on little people
like yourselves?


197
00:21:23.578 --> 00:21:25.091
Why, he just eats them.

198
00:21:25.328 --> 00:21:27.398
He pops them into his mouth like candy...

199
00:21:27.582 --> 00:21:31.212
and he chews them up
and he swallows them, bones and all.


200
00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:38.210
Do you know what "law" is?

201
00:21:39.636 --> 00:21:42.753
Good. From now on, that's the law, see?

202
00:21:43.432 --> 00:21:46.583
No one goes over to the other side.

203
00:21:52.066 --> 00:21:53.419
You look funny.

204
00:21:54.151 --> 00:21:56.984
Children, where are you?

205
00:21:59.449 --> 00:22:00.802
Look at me.

206
00:22:02.952 --> 00:22:04.305
Look at me.

207
00:22:31.232 --> 00:22:33.951
You're silly
when you drink out of that barrel.


208
00:22:34.652 --> 00:22:36.324
This is a serious dance.

209
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:38.838
Sing the one
about the Hoochie Coochie girls.


210
00:22:39.032 --> 00:22:41.102
Come on. Are you ready?

211
00:24:08.292 --> 00:24:09.771
Where's Paddy?

212
00:24:25.434 --> 00:24:26.754
He's gone.

213
00:24:28.355 --> 00:24:29.754
There he is.

214
00:24:29.982 --> 00:24:33.452
He must have swum over there
and gone to sleep. Come on.


215
00:24:42.495 --> 00:24:44.372
What are you doing that for?

216
00:24:44.747 --> 00:24:48.899
I'm going to put it on Mr. Button's head,
so when you say "boo" into his ear...


217
00:24:49.418 --> 00:24:51.568
he'll jump up with it on.

218
00:25:16.655 --> 00:25:18.611
Paddy, wake up, it's us.

219
00:25:21.327 --> 00:25:23.363
Wake up!

220
00:26:05.958 --> 00:26:08.472
Don't worry, Em, we'll be all right.

221
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.099
Take me away from this place, Richard.

222
00:26:53.423 --> 00:26:54.572
Look!

223
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.996
This looks like a good place
to stay for awhile.


224
00:30:28.691 --> 00:30:31.125
Wake up. It's Christmas morning.

225
00:30:31.528 --> 00:30:32.563
Christmas?

226
00:30:32.695 --> 00:30:35.971
Yesterday, I counted 52 big marks
on the tree and last night he came.


227
00:30:36.198 --> 00:30:37.597
What are you talking about?

228
00:30:37.741 --> 00:30:41.620
Santa Claus. I saw all his reindeer
right there on the beach.


229
00:30:41.871 --> 00:30:43.782
Let's see if he brought us anything.

230
00:30:43.957 --> 00:30:45.231
Come on, Em, hurry.

231
00:30:50.755 --> 00:30:53.269
That's where the reindeer were, see?

232
00:30:54.968 --> 00:30:56.765
Look at our stockings.

233
00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.801
And there's something in them!

234
00:31:13.863 --> 00:31:15.740
Look, just what I always wanted.

235
00:31:15.949 --> 00:31:17.177
What are they?

236
00:31:17.367 --> 00:31:19.437
What do they look like? 
They're marbles.

237
00:31:19.619 --> 00:31:22.611
See, these are your Jaspers
and these are your Peewees.


238
00:31:26.293 --> 00:31:27.806
You did it all.

239
00:31:28.294 --> 00:31:29.090
But...

240
00:31:35.386 --> 00:31:37.138
Fooled ya, didn't I?

241
00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:41.334
You!

242
00:31:51.569 --> 00:31:53.127
Why are we always fighting so much?

243
00:31:55.198 --> 00:31:56.392
I don't know.

244
00:31:57.201 --> 00:32:00.477
That should be our New Year's revolution:
To stop fighting so much.


245
00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.775
- I'll try, but...
- But, what?


246
00:32:05.418 --> 00:32:08.728
I don't know what's wrong with me
when I say the things I say.


247
00:32:09.421 --> 00:32:11.810
I just keep on having
all these strange thoughts.


248
00:32:13.092 --> 00:32:14.684
What kind of thoughts?

249
00:32:15.177 --> 00:32:17.930
Just thoughts.
Funny thoughts about you and me.


250
00:32:20.725 --> 00:32:21.840
Tell me.

251
00:32:21.976 --> 00:32:23.329
I couldn't.

252
00:32:23.728 --> 00:32:26.606
They're just thoughts.
They don't mean anything.


253
00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:29.170
Where did you find these?

254
00:32:29.359 --> 00:32:31.395
I found them in those little shells.

255
00:32:32.779 --> 00:32:34.497
They're beautiful. Thank you.

256

260
00:34:10.298 --> 00:34:11.287
Help!

261
00:34:22.852 --> 00:34:23.841
What's wrong?

262
00:34:27.692 --> 00:34:28.761
You're bleeding.

263
00:34:30.695 --> 00:34:32.014
Don't! I'm all right.

264
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.514
But you're bleeding.

265
00:34:33.947 --> 00:34:35.585
Go away! Don't look at me.

266
00:34:38.787 --> 00:34:40.016
Go away!

267
00:35:08.442 --> 00:35:09.955
What was it, Em?

268
00:35:10.319 --> 00:35:13.152
- Why were you bleeding like that?
- I don't know.


269
00:35:13.448 --> 00:35:14.563
Liar!

270
00:35:14.825 --> 00:35:16.781
It's true, I don't know.

272
00:35:20.789 --> 00:35:24.180
People don't bleed like that
unless they've cut themselves.


273
00:35:24.961 --> 00:35:27.680
Maybe you're hurt real bad
and you just don't know it.


274
00:35:27.964 --> 00:35:30.353
- Let me look.
- No! I don't want you to look.


275
00:35:30.675 --> 00:35:33.064
- But, why?
- Just because.


276
00:35:33.802 --> 00:35:35.360
That is not fair.

277
00:35:35.596 --> 00:35:38.793
I don't keep any secrets from you.
I tell you everything.


278
00:35:39.309 --> 00:35:40.662
Everything.

279
00:36:25.648 --> 00:36:27.400
What are you looking at?

280
00:36:27.567 --> 00:36:28.522
Your muscles.

281
00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.304
What about them?

282
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.886
You're really acting silly lately.
Always saying dumb things like that.


283
00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.752
Always looking at me funny.

284
00:36:38.244 --> 00:36:40.633
You're not coming down with something,
are you?


285
00:36:42.666 --> 00:36:44.384
Well, don't give it to me.

286
00:38:03.752 --> 00:38:04.741
Tell me again.

287
00:38:05.128 --> 00:38:07.801
- Where are your mother and father?
- In heaven.


288
00:38:08.297 --> 00:38:09.889
But where's heaven?

289
00:38:10.509 --> 00:38:12.067
You know, up there.

290
00:38:12.802 --> 00:38:15.919
- Your father might be there, too.
- No, he's not.


291
00:38:16.389 --> 00:38:18.858
He's coming on a ship someday
to take us home.


292
00:38:23.522 --> 00:38:24.875
Do you hear it?

293
00:38:25.525 --> 00:38:26.560
No.

294
00:38:26.776 --> 00:38:28.448
Do you ever hear it?

295
00:38:28.611 --> 00:38:30.522
Sometimes I think I do.

296
00:38:31.113 --> 00:38:32.705
I think Paddy was a liar.

297
00:38:33.366 --> 00:38:36.642
He told us there was a pot of gold
at the end of every rainbow...


298
00:38:36.911 --> 00:38:38.469
and that was a lie.

299
00:38:38.956 --> 00:38:41.868
He told us if we dug far enough
we'd reach China.


300
00:38:42.417 --> 00:38:44.487
And Santa Claus never came.

301
00:38:50.843 --> 00:38:53.437
Do you ever think about him?

302
00:38:56.556 --> 00:38:57.671
I do.

303
00:39:00.351 --> 00:39:02.820
I know you don't like to
talk about it, but...


304
00:39:03.565 --> 00:39:06.602
don't you ever wonder
what really happened?


305
00:39:09.446 --> 00:39:11.676
I don't want to know what happened.

306
00:39:14.785 --> 00:39:15.774
I do.

307
00:39:17.245 --> 00:39:19.759
There are so many things
I don't understand.


308
00:39:19.957 --> 00:39:24.394
Why do fish stop swimming and lie on top
of the tide pools after it rains?


309
00:39:26.004 --> 00:39:28.438
Why do you hear the waves
inside the big shells?


310
00:39:28.674 --> 00:39:31.108
Why are all these funny hairs
growing on me?


311
00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.536
I wish a big book with all the answers
to every question in the world...


312
00:39:38.768 --> 00:39:41.726
would drop out of the sky
and land in my hand right now.


313
00:39:41.937 --> 00:39:45.612
- I'd read it till I knew everything.
- You can't know everything.


314
00:39:46.902 --> 00:39:48.733
Only God knows everything.

315
00:39:49.154 --> 00:39:50.223
God?

316
00:39:50.447 --> 00:39:53.245
He can't find us
any better than Santa Claus.


317
00:40:26.066 --> 00:40:28.057
I wonder what fish think about?

318
00:40:33.284 --> 00:40:34.763
What are you doing?

319
00:40:34.994 --> 00:40:37.827
Trying to cheer you up. 
Come on, laugh.

320
00:40:39.748 --> 00:40:41.340
It's not going to work.

321
00:40:43.126 --> 00:40:44.798
There it is again.

322
00:40:48.258 --> 00:40:50.294
Do you think it's the bogeyman?

323
00:40:52.344 --> 00:40:54.221
Maybe it's another person.

324
00:40:57.725 --> 00:40:58.475
No...

325
00:40:58.935 --> 00:41:01.893
or he would have come over
to meet us and say hello.


326
00:41:02.438 --> 00:41:04.076
That's the proper thing to do.

327
00:41:04.232 --> 00:41:07.065
What if he's not nice?
What if he wants to hurt us?


328
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:10.929
Then I'll spear him.

329
00:41:33.013 --> 00:41:35.652
Look! I'm the greatest fisherman
who ever lived.


330
00:41:36.474 --> 00:41:38.544
I'm the greatest fisherman who ever lived.

331
00:41:38.727 --> 00:41:41.525
While you scare them off,
I catch as many as I want to.


332
00:41:41.854 --> 00:41:44.209
That's my fish dance!
It doesn't scare them off.


333
00:41:44.398 --> 00:41:47.310
It brings them up to the surface
where I can spear them.


334
00:41:47.527 --> 00:41:49.040
Who cares what you say?

335
00:41:49.195 --> 00:41:51.914
It's not how many you catch.
It's how you do it.


336
00:42:09.801 --> 00:42:11.120
Stop that!

337
00:42:12.845 --> 00:42:15.075
Please play something else.

338
00:42:16.224 --> 00:42:19.296
Why must you do that
when you know it makes me angry?


339
00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:37.178
"It doesn't scare them away.
It brings 'em to the top..."


340
00:42:37.371 --> 00:42:38.963
"...where I can spear them."

341
00:42:39.623 --> 00:42:40.772
I'll spear you.

342
00:42:59.353 --> 00:43:00.672
Here I am.

343
00:43:01.272 --> 00:43:02.500
Come back here...

344
00:43:02.732 --> 00:43:05.690
or I'll pull your britches down
and take a switch to you.


345
00:43:07.194 --> 00:43:09.583
Don't you dare try to
spank me. I mean it.

346
00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.578
I'll put never-wake-up berries
in your food! I mean it.


347
00:43:12.783 --> 00:43:15.138
Say, "Richard is the smartest person
on the island."


348
00:43:15.745 --> 00:43:18.657
- Say it!
- Stop it, Richard. I'm getting angry.


349
00:43:19.083 --> 00:43:20.960
- Stop it! Now get off.
- Say it!


350
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.059
Richard is the smartest person
on the island.


351
00:43:24.254 --> 00:43:26.405
- The fastest swimmer.
- The fastest swimmer.


352
00:43:26.591 --> 00:43:28.661
- The fastest runner.
- The fastest runner.


353
00:43:28.842 --> 00:43:31.879
- The best hut builder.
- You're the best everything. Now get off!


354
00:43:32.347 --> 00:43:33.382
It's true.

355
00:43:34.682 --> 00:43:37.150
Just you wait.
You'll never know when it'll happen.


356
00:43:37.352 --> 00:43:39.946
Just one little bite
and you'll never wake up again.


357
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:14.801
- What is it? What happened?
- I saw him.


358
00:48:14.976 --> 00:48:17.410
- Who?
- The face Paddy thought was a bogeyman.


359
00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:20.288
- You went to the other side?
- He's not the bogeyman.


360
00:48:20.481 --> 00:48:22.119
I think he's God.

361
00:48:22.358 --> 00:48:22.949
God?

362
00:48:23.067 --> 00:48:25.297
He looks like Pastor Logan said
he looked like:


363
00:48:25.486 --> 00:48:28.284
"You'd better be good or else."
And he was bleeding.


364
00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:30.449
- I don't believe you.
- Just like Jesus.


365
00:48:30.617 --> 00:48:32.573
Don't go there again. It's the law.

366
00:48:32.744 --> 00:48:35.099
What if he really is God?
Shouldn't we go and pray?


367
00:48:35.288 --> 00:48:37.848
Or won't he be mad
and not let us go to heaven?


368
00:48:38.041 --> 00:48:39.997
I don't want to talk about it.

369
00:49:59.459 --> 00:50:00.779
What is it?

370
00:50:01.962 --> 00:50:02.758
I'm here.

371
00:50:07.802 --> 00:50:10.794
- You ate the "dead and berries"...
- No, I'm fine.


372
00:50:11.015 --> 00:50:13.768
- You just had a bad dream.
- Don't ever leave me.


373
00:50:14.475 --> 00:50:17.035
Promise you won't.
Promise you'll always be with me.


374
00:50:17.521 --> 00:50:18.431
I promise.

375
00:50:30.743 --> 00:50:32.017
Don't.

376
00:51:33.768 --> 00:51:35.486
What are you doing?

377
00:51:37.021 --> 00:51:38.249
Go away!

378
00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.932
Where are you going?

379
00:52:11.598 --> 00:52:13.590
Wait. What's the matter?

380
00:52:32.913 --> 00:52:35.188
- What are you doing?
- What do you want?


381
00:52:36.375 --> 00:52:37.933
Why won't you talk to me?

382
00:52:38.376 --> 00:52:40.765
Just leave me alone.

383
00:54:03.966 --> 00:54:05.684
A ship, Emmeline!

384
00:54:08.555 --> 00:54:12.753
The signal fire, you didn't light it.
Why didn't you light it?


385
00:54:13.017 --> 00:54:17.010
You know how much I want to leave.
It's the most important thing to me.


386
00:54:17.313 --> 00:54:18.507
I know.

387
00:54:19.482 --> 00:54:21.950
First you cry for help,
then you throw sticks at me.


388
00:54:22.152 --> 00:54:23.426
A ship comes, a ship!

389
00:54:23.654 --> 00:54:28.091
The first ship we've seen
since we've been here and you let it go by.


390
00:54:28.409 --> 00:54:30.639
Well, that's it. I've had it.

391
00:54:30.828 --> 00:54:33.262
I'm sick and tired
of waiting for you to get better.


392
00:54:33.497 --> 00:54:35.613
I'm going to San Fr'isco without you.

393
00:55:35.104 --> 00:55:38.335
You'll never build a boat strong enough
to get to San Fr'isco.


394
00:55:38.607 --> 00:55:41.485
That's the fourth time you've tried
and they've all sunk.


395
00:55:41.694 --> 00:55:42.604
Shut up!

396
00:55:42.736 --> 00:55:44.055
Why don't you give up?

397
00:55:44.196 --> 00:55:46.756
You don't even know where San Fr'isco is.

398
00:55:49.535 --> 00:55:52.528
You're such a silly dodo.
We're never getting off this island.


399
00:55:52.748 --> 00:55:54.181
Thanks to you.

400
00:55:54.416 --> 00:55:57.294
This is where we live.
This is our home, now and forever.


401
00:55:57.502 --> 00:55:58.537
No!

402
00:55:58.712 --> 00:56:00.942
I could never live here forever
with just you.


403
00:56:01.173 --> 00:56:03.733
I don't even like you.
You never used to laugh at me.


404
00:56:03.926 --> 00:56:05.598
You never used to have secrets.

405
00:56:05.761 --> 00:56:08.434
You're not so perfect either,
Mr. Richard Lestrange.


406
00:56:08.639 --> 00:56:10.231
I've seen you playing with it.

407
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:12.779
And I'll tell your father
if he ever gets here.


408
00:56:12.976 --> 00:56:14.614
You. I hate you.

409
00:56:16.689 --> 00:56:18.008
You almost hit me.

410
00:56:18.148 --> 00:56:20.901
- Take back what you said.
- I've seen it all.


411
00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:23.066
What happens after you
do it a long time.

412
00:56:23.238 --> 00:56:25.194
Shut up! That isn't fair, peeking.

413
00:56:25.364 --> 00:56:26.922
- I don't peek on you.
- That's a lie.


414
00:56:27.075 --> 00:56:28.906
You're always staring at my buppies.

415
00:56:29.077 --> 00:56:32.114
Only because they look so funny.
You know what you look like now?


416
00:56:32.330 --> 00:56:34.446
You look like
one of those pictures Paddy had.


417
00:56:34.624 --> 00:56:36.343
One of his Hoochie Coochie girls.

418
00:56:36.502 --> 00:56:37.537
I do not!

419
00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:43.058
Stop that, or I'll
never talk to you again.

420
00:56:44.719 --> 00:56:46.710
See them jiggle, wiggle and shake.

421
00:56:49.223 --> 00:56:52.021
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit you.

422
00:56:53.937 --> 00:56:56.167
I wish you were dead and buried.

423
00:57:04.448 --> 00:57:05.881
What are you doing?

424
00:57:12.039 --> 00:57:13.950
It's my hut. I built it.

425
00:57:14.124 --> 00:57:16.160
That's not true. I helped you.

426
00:57:16.335 --> 00:57:19.089
I did most of it.
You can find some other place to live.


427
00:57:19.297 --> 00:57:22.767
I said I was sorry, Richard.
What more do you want me to say?


428
00:57:23.009 --> 00:57:25.398
I don't want you to say anything.

429
00:57:28.348 --> 00:57:30.816
I don't ever want to see you again.

430
00:57:32.018 --> 00:57:35.294
You just wait, Richard Lestrange.
I'll get you for this!


431
00:58:43.884 --> 00:58:45.715
What's wrong with you?

432
00:58:47.389 --> 00:58:48.617
Go away.

433
00:58:54.188 --> 00:58:55.860
What happened?

434
00:58:56.565 --> 00:59:00.080
I stepped on one of those fish
that looks like a rock.


435
00:59:06.742 --> 00:59:08.141
Don't go to sleep.

436
00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:12.467
Oh, no. Please wake up.

437
00:59:13.833 --> 00:59:14.902
God.

438
00:59:17.754 --> 00:59:19.267
Take me to God.

439
00:59:20.381 --> 00:59:21.780
But the law...

440
01:00:25.784 --> 01:00:26.853
God...

441
01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.838
please don't make Em never wake up.

442
01:00:31.081 --> 01:00:34.596
I didn't mean it when I said
I wanted her dead and buried.


443
01:00:37.129 --> 01:00:39.768
I forgot most of my prayers, God...

444
01:00:42.134 --> 01:00:43.123
But...

445
01:00:47.597 --> 01:00:49.189
Our Father...

446
01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:53.448
who art in heaven...

447
01:00:57.691 --> 01:00:59.091
kingdom come...

448
01:01:10.288 --> 01:01:12.438
with liberty and justice for all.

449
01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:13.864
Amen.

450
01:01:39.819 --> 01:01:41.491
Em, are you all right?

451
01:01:43.907 --> 01:01:45.545
I've been so worried.

452
01:01:48.412 --> 01:01:50.846
You mean, you're not mad at me anymore?

453
01:01:51.165 --> 01:01:52.644
Of course not.

454
01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:56.594
I was so scared.

455
01:02:02.052 --> 01:02:03.804
All I could think of was:

456
01:02:06.597 --> 01:02:08.315
What if I lost my Em?

457
01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:14.070
What would I do?

458
01:02:49.058 --> 01:02:52.368
Here's some food
to help you get your strength back.


459
01:02:56.609 --> 01:02:58.998
Do you see that island out there?

460
01:02:59.861 --> 01:03:00.930
Yes.

461
01:03:01.781 --> 01:03:04.853
I've been thinking, maybe the person
who makes the drum noise...


462
01:03:05.075 --> 01:03:07.828
lives there and then comes here to pray.

463
01:03:09.330 --> 01:03:10.480
Maybe.

464
01:03:11.833 --> 01:03:14.063
Would you like to try to walk?

465
01:03:29.476 --> 01:03:30.670
You all right?

466
01:03:31.229 --> 01:03:32.298
Yes.

467
01:05:17.296 --> 01:05:18.524
Kiss me.

468
01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:20.762
You're all sticky.

469
01:05:21.092 --> 01:05:22.970
So what? Kiss me.

470
01:05:27.892 --> 01:05:29.610
Stop it, I can't breath.

471
01:05:29.810 --> 01:05:31.801
But I don't want to stop.

472
01:05:34.358 --> 01:05:36.076
What are you doing?

473
01:05:44.034 --> 01:05:45.262
Stop it.

474
01:06:02.886 --> 01:06:05.116
I feel so funny in my stomach.

475
01:06:09.061 --> 01:06:10.289
Me, too.

476
01:06:15.693 --> 01:06:17.763
My heart is beating so fast.

477
01:06:20.656 --> 01:06:21.975
Mine, too.

478
01:12:44.892 --> 01:12:47.360
Will you stop eating? 
You're getting fat.

479
01:12:51.399 --> 01:12:53.549
Come on up, keep me warm?

480
01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:16.978
Where's Em, Coco?

481
01:13:55.507 --> 01:13:57.225
I'm sorry, Richard.

482
01:13:57.426 --> 01:13:59.894
You didn't want it all
day yesterday either.


483
01:14:00.094 --> 01:14:02.654
What's the matter?
Don't you love me anymore?


484
01:14:02.848 --> 01:14:05.601
Yes, I love you more than ever, Richard.

485
01:14:06.101 --> 01:14:08.172
Then why don't you want to do it?

486
01:14:08.981 --> 01:14:11.495
It just hurts right now, that's all.

487
01:14:12.817 --> 01:14:15.012
When it stops hurting, we'll do it.

488
01:14:15.195 --> 01:14:17.026
When is that going to be?

489
01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:22.873
I don't understand. 
Why does it hurt?

490
01:14:23.829 --> 01:14:25.262
I don't know.

491
01:14:25.747 --> 01:14:27.578
I don't know anything.

492
01:14:31.253 --> 01:14:34.211
But if you touch my tummy right now,
you can feel it.


493
01:14:36.843 --> 01:14:37.992
Feel what?

494
01:14:43.516 --> 01:14:45.825
How did you make
your tummy move like that?


495
01:14:46.019 --> 01:14:47.657
I'm not doing it.

496
01:14:48.688 --> 01:14:50.838
It's not doing it by itself.

497
01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.794
Yes, it is.

498
01:14:54.694 --> 01:14:56.650
There. I felt it again.

499
01:14:57.322 --> 01:14:59.313
What's making it do that?

500
01:15:00.659 --> 01:15:02.092
I don't know.

501
01:15:37.073 --> 01:15:38.552
Where are you?

502
01:17:45.999 --> 01:17:47.752
Where are you?

503
01:18:05.354 --> 01:18:07.424
What's wrong? Did they hurt you?

504
01:18:08.147 --> 01:18:09.262
They?

505
01:18:24.456 --> 01:18:26.845
What is it? Tell me what to do.

506
01:18:27.042 --> 01:18:28.395
What is it?

507
01:18:29.711 --> 01:18:31.031
Answer me.

508
01:19:36.615 --> 01:19:38.253
Why did you have a baby?

509
01:19:39.117 --> 01:19:40.550
I don't know.

510
01:19:45.291 --> 01:19:46.690
Hello, baby.

511
01:19:57.137 --> 01:19:59.174
Look, I think he's hungry.

512
01:20:00.474 --> 01:20:02.271
What do you feed him?

513
01:20:02.559 --> 01:20:04.117
Try some fruit.

514
01:20:05.687 --> 01:20:07.086
Here you go.

515
01:20:09.817 --> 01:20:11.409
Good food. Fruit.

516
01:20:12.278 --> 01:20:13.870
It doesn't like it.

517
01:20:14.405 --> 01:20:16.202
Here, let me try this.

518
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:27.183
What do I do?

519
01:21:08.628 --> 01:21:10.186
Why are you doing that?

520
01:21:10.339 --> 01:21:11.738
The drum people.

521
01:21:11.966 --> 01:21:13.081
What?

522
01:21:14.801 --> 01:21:15.870
I saw them.

523
01:21:16.344 --> 01:21:17.413
When?

524
01:21:17.553 --> 01:21:19.225
The night he came.

525
01:21:20.307 --> 01:21:21.899
What did they look like?

526
01:21:22.183 --> 01:21:24.651
I don't want to talk about it.
Paddy was right.


527
01:21:24.853 --> 01:21:26.731
We shouldn't have gone to the other side.

528
01:21:26.898 --> 01:21:28.934
We should have never broken the law.

529
01:21:29.108 --> 01:21:31.497
- Do they know we're here?
- I don't think so.


530
01:21:31.694 --> 01:21:34.049
If they come,
I'll do to them what I do to the fish.


531
01:21:34.239 --> 01:21:35.877
I'll stick it through their eyes!

532
01:21:36.033 --> 01:21:40.151
I'll stick it through their bellies
and watch their guts come out!


533
01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:10.493
Remember on the ship
when we tried to get to the dinghy...


534
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:13.863
how the men
pushed and shoved each other?


535
01:22:15.574 --> 01:22:17.405
How their eyes looked?

536
01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:21.254
It was the same with the drum people.

537
01:22:24.708 --> 01:22:29.304
I don't understand. Why do people
have to be so bad to each other?


538
01:25:50.758 --> 01:25:52.191
Come here, hurry.

539
01:25:52.718 --> 01:25:54.356
I'm busy keeping watch.

540
01:25:54.637 --> 01:25:56.787
Come on, you have to see this.

541
01:26:22.082 --> 01:26:23.993
You taught him to swim.

542
01:27:26.776 --> 01:27:28.846
Water.

543
01:27:32.781 --> 01:27:34.260
Look at the fishies.

544
01:27:35.951 --> 01:27:37.828
Around the tree and back down the hole.

545
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:44.183
Get the boat.

546
01:28:35.513 --> 01:28:38.630
Look at the bird. Look, Paddy.

547
01:28:45.399 --> 01:28:47.754
Do you see some fishies?
What do you see?


548
01:28:48.361 --> 01:28:50.033
Tell me, do you see a ship?

549
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:03.183
Paddy, fan.

550
01:29:04.585 --> 01:29:05.813
Richard.

551
01:29:06.922 --> 01:29:08.435
He said my name.

552
01:29:14.888 --> 01:29:17.482
Look, Paddy, we're making footprints.

553
01:29:17.849 --> 01:29:19.601
Like Boston in the winter.

554
01:29:19.768 --> 01:29:23.363
Remember the snowball fights we had
every time it snowed?


555
01:29:27.150 --> 01:29:28.823
See, it's freezing.

556
01:29:30.864 --> 01:29:32.183
It's cold.

557
01:29:38.038 --> 01:29:40.108
The bogeyman.

558
01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:58.192
You better bring him up to see
or he'll hear about it from the crew...


559
01:29:58.433 --> 01:30:01.027
and we'll have to sail back tomorrow.

560
01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:03.248
Excuse me, sir.

561
01:30:03.438 --> 01:30:05.235
We sighted something.

562
01:30:10.988 --> 01:30:12.216
There.

563
01:30:13.992 --> 01:30:15.584
What do you think?

564
01:30:15.786 --> 01:30:17.424
Can we go closer?

565
01:30:18.414 --> 01:30:21.565
I'll see,
but we have to be careful of that reef.


566
01:30:30.676 --> 01:30:32.075
Look at that face.

567
01:30:34.889 --> 01:30:36.004
Boat.

568
01:31:13.764 --> 01:31:15.800
No, that couldn't be them.

569
01:31:51.094 --> 01:31:54.609
Do you know how to get to
the place where we lived with Paddy?


570
01:31:54.848 --> 01:31:57.237
Sure. I go there for bananas.

571
01:31:57.434 --> 01:31:58.867
Take me there?

572
01:31:59.519 --> 01:32:01.111
I thought you were afraid.

573
01:32:01.271 --> 01:32:03.182
I want to see it again.

574
01:32:06.026 --> 01:32:07.345
In you go.

575
01:32:44.066 --> 01:32:45.419
You coming?

576
01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.309
Shark!

577
01:35:54.599 --> 01:35:56.237
I have to get the oars.

578
01:36:01.981 --> 01:36:03.893
Help me, Em, we're drifting.

579
01:36:08.531 --> 01:36:09.964
Go away.

580
01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:20.786
Look how far out we are!

581
01:36:39.437 --> 01:36:41.109
I can't stop this.

582
01:37:23.024 --> 01:37:24.252
Paddy, look.

583
01:37:24.692 --> 01:37:26.967
When it hits the water,
you can hear it hiss.


584
01:37:27.155 --> 01:37:28.474
Look, see?

585
01:37:28.614 --> 01:37:29.842
Hear it?

586
01:37:44.548 --> 01:37:45.424
I'm thirsty.

587
01:37:46.383 --> 01:37:47.896
I wish we had some water.

588
01:38:06.695 --> 01:38:07.889
Fishies.

589
01:38:11.659 --> 01:38:13.775
No, Paddy!

590
01:38:14.245 --> 01:38:16.965
- Where did you get those?
- Get those out of your mouth.


591
01:38:17.165 --> 01:38:21.283
What are you doing?
Get those out of your mouth.


592
01:38:28.177 --> 01:38:29.849
He swallowed some.

593
01:38:45.862 --> 01:38:47.181
Come here.

594
01:38:58.165 --> 01:38:59.918
Don't close your eyes, Paddy.

595
01:39:00.086 --> 01:39:02.077
Please don't go to sleep.

596
01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:13.629
Please.

597
01:40:55.081 --> 01:40:59.040
Three points to port, sir.
Looks to be a small craft.


598
01:40:59.710 --> 01:41:01.063
See anyone in it?

599
01:41:01.504 --> 01:41:03.256
I can't make it out.

600
01:41:05.758 --> 01:41:08.670
Captain, three points to port.

601
01:42:15.957 --> 01:42:17.436
Are they dead?

602
01:42:20.128 --> 01:42:22.039
No, sir. They're asleep.
