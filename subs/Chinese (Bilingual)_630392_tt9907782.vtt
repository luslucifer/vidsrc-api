1
00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:43.340
队长。
Captain.


2
00:00:46.778 --> 00:00:48.178
队长。
Captain.


3
00:00:57.822 --> 00:00:59.815
谢谢你,队长。
Thanks, Captain.


4
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.959
队长。
Captain.


5
00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.335
等一等。
Hold on.


6
00:02:18.903 --> 00:02:20.963
等一下，等一下。
Hold on, hold on.


7
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.941
好的，带他回来。快点，快点!快点。
Right, bring him to. Come on, hurry up! Hurry up.


8
00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:33.676
好了，好了。把他带过来。
All right, all right. Bring him over here.


9
00:02:33.718 --> 00:02:35.544
快点，让他排好队，排好队，排好队。
Come on, line him up, line him up, line him up.


10
00:02:35.586 --> 00:02:37.889
一，二，三，来吧。带他过去。
One, two, three, come on. Bring him over.


11
00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:40.650
你好，先生，我是康明斯博士。
Hello, sir. My name is Dr. Cummins.


12
00:02:40.692 --> 00:02:42.618
我会好好照顾你的。
I'm going to be taking care of you.


13
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.922
四个男孩……腹部中了三枪。
Four for a boy... Okay, we have three shots in the abdomen.


14
00:02:46.964 --> 00:02:51.727
5个结婚，6个生孩子…-他在说什么?-一胎六个
Five for a wedding, six for a birth... - What's he saying? - Six for a birth.


15
00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:52.937
听起来像一首童谣。
Sounds like a nursery rhyme.


16
00:02:54.706 --> 00:02:56.766
我得进去拿这些东西。
I'm gonna have to go in and get these.


17
00:02:56.808 --> 00:02:58.208
抓住了他。
Hold him down.


18
00:02:58.776 --> 00:03:00.503
好了，开始吧。
Okay, here we go.


19
00:03:08.052 --> 00:03:09.578
一个
One.


20
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.614
进入第二阶段。
Going in for the second.


21
00:03:11.656 --> 00:03:13.616
-听我说。-一场婚礼五个。
- Stay with me. - Five for a wedding.


22
00:03:13.658 --> 00:03:16.317
-一场婚礼五个。——两个。
- Five for a wedding. - Two.


23
00:03:19.396 --> 00:03:21.289
呃，呃，它碎了。
Uh, uh, it's shattered.


24
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:23.291
我得再去一次了。
I'm gonna have to go in a second time.


25
00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:28.305
-好，最后一个。-一场婚礼五个…等一下，这里还有别的东西。
- Okay, last one. - Five for a wedding... Wait a minute, there's something else in here.


26
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.899
好了，来了。
Okay, here it comes.


27
00:03:34.946 --> 00:03:36.906
好吧。
Okay.


28
00:03:40.752 --> 00:03:41.977
那不是德国子弹。
That's not a German bullet.


29
00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.713
银八。
Eight for silver.


30
00:04:25.062 --> 00:04:26.522
他是如何?
How is he?


31
00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:28.491
不太好，夫人。
Not so good, ma'am.


32
00:04:55.392 --> 00:04:56.819
夏洛特!
Charlotte!


33
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:58.453
我有你的书。
I have your book.


34
00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:00.097
爱德华，那是我的书。给它回来。
Edward, that's my book. Give it back.


35
00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:04.493
-还给我!-爱德华，马上住手!
- Give it back! - Edward, stop this at once!


36
00:05:04.535 --> 00:05:06.028
夏洛特。
Charlotte.


37
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.672
请。
Please.


38
00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:12.409
你不能再取笑你妹妹了。
You must stop teasing your sister.


39
00:05:15.847 --> 00:05:17.506
美味。
Delicious.


40
00:05:17.548 --> 00:05:19.440
谢谢你！
Thank you.


41
00:05:19.482 --> 00:05:22.945
阿娜伊斯，能帮我倒点热水吗?
Anais, would you mind preparing me some hot water?


42
00:05:22.987 --> 00:05:25.422
我想洗个澡。——是的,女士。
- I'd like to take a bath. - Yes, ma'am.


43
00:06:56.147 --> 00:06:58.173
嘿，你们两个最好别闹了!
Hey, you two better knock it off!


44
00:08:56.367 --> 00:08:59.695
-是长辈。-我们下去听。
- It's the elders. - Let's go down and listen.


45
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.241
是的，我们得想个办法。
Yes, we need to find a solution.


46
00:09:12.283 --> 00:09:14.977
在过去的三个星期里，更多的人加入了他们。
In the last three weeks, more have joined them.


47
00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:16.745
我们知道他们在哪吗?
And do we know where they are?


48
00:09:16.787 --> 00:09:20.382
他们在伍德菲尔德和戴的岩石之间扎营。
They are camped between Wood Field and Dei's Rock.


49
00:09:20.424 --> 00:09:23.260
他们声称这块土地属于他们。
They claim the land belongs to them.


50
00:09:25.729 --> 00:09:27.956
有人研究过这种说法的有效性吗?
Has anyone looked into the validity of this claim?


51
00:09:27.998 --> 00:09:37.041
这一追溯至80年前的说法似乎确实有一定的合理性，但没有什么记录是不能改变的，对我们有利。
There does seem to be some validity to the claim that dates back 80 years, but there is nothing on record that can't be changed in our favor.


52
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.670
有人试过和他们谈判吗?
Has anyone tried to negotiate with them?


53
00:09:41.712 --> 00:09:45.240
他们是吉普赛人,谢默斯。
They're Gypsies, Seamus.


54
00:09:45.282 --> 00:09:52.323
他们声称对我们共享的大量土地拥有主权而我们已经向他们提出了放弃的条件。
They're laying claim to a sizeable amount of our shared lands and we've made them an offer to walk away.


55
00:09:52.756 --> 00:09:54.683
这个报价很可观。
The offer was substantial.


56
00:09:54.725 --> 00:09:57.628
他们想要土地。
They want the land.


57
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:02.166
那是不允许发生的。
That can't be allowed to happen.


58
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:11.075
在这个房间里，我们都有可能失去一些东西，所以我的建议是别在这里说。
We all have something to lose in this room, so what I'm suggesting stays in this room.


59
00:10:11.442 --> 00:10:14.136
夏洛特，爱德华，你们走吧。你去。走,走。
Charlotte, Edward, off you go. Off you go. Go, go.


60
00:10:14.178 --> 00:10:21.085
提供的钱被用来雇佣雇佣兵把他们从土地上赶走。
The money that was offered is used to hire mercenaries to remove them from the land.


61
00:10:21.418 --> 00:10:27.191
根据我的经验，棍子的威胁通常就足够了。
In my experience, the threat of the stick is normally enough.


62
00:12:07.524 --> 00:12:09.818
这片土地不是你的。
This land is not yours.


63
00:12:12.429 --> 00:12:15.891
你被告知这块地不是你的!
You're being told this land is not yours!


64
00:12:15.933 --> 00:12:18.561
集合你的人，离开这片土地!
Gather your people, get off the land!


65
00:13:36.447 --> 00:13:37.607
我们开始吧。
Here we go.


66
00:13:42.219 --> 00:13:43.579
再看另一个。
Let's take another one.


67
00:13:49.059 --> 00:13:51.228
抓到这两个企图逃跑的人。
Caught these two trying to escape.


68
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:53.889
女人有这些。
Woman had these.


69
00:13:53.931 --> 00:13:55.957
那个老婊子想用它们咬我。
Old whore tried to fucking bite me with them.


70
00:13:55.999 --> 00:13:57.959
-她做了吗?——不。
- And did she? - Nah.


71
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.380
你以为你能用你的咒语和魔法大摇大摆地闯进我的国家然后想去哪儿就去哪儿吗?
You think you can just waltz into my country with your spells and magic and take whatever land you fancy?


72
00:14:16.654 --> 00:14:18.122
以他们为例。
Make an example of them.


73
00:14:18.522 --> 00:14:22.159
一个警告。他这种人在这里不受欢迎。
A warning. His kind aren't welcome 'round here.


74
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.588
一定要把这些和她一起埋了。
Make sure you bury these with her.


75
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.189
你确定吗?
You sure?


76
00:14:27.231 --> 00:14:29.500
银。值一大笔钱。
Silver. Worth a pretty penny.


77
00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:33.203
没有任何价值。就死亡。
There's no worth in it. Just death.


78
00:14:41.311 --> 00:14:42.513
让他们离开我的视线!
Get 'em outta my sight!


79
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.674
来吧!
Come on!


80
00:14:48.653 --> 00:14:49.386
把他放在那里。
Put him there.


81
00:14:50.688 --> 00:14:53.490
现在，让我给你穿上一件漂亮的外套。
Now, let's get you in a nice coat.


82
00:14:57.995 --> 00:15:00.030
是的，把它戴上。
Yeah, put that on.


83
00:15:02.433 --> 00:15:03.333
好了。
There we go.


84
00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:08.397
我们可不想让你着凉，对吧?
We don't want you getting cold, do we?


85
00:15:08.439 --> 00:15:10.298
你得在外面待一阵子。
You're gonna be out here a while.


86
00:15:19.751 --> 00:15:27.157
这是给你的教训，用你那肮脏的吉普赛嘴跟我的船长说话。
Now, this'll teach you to run your filthy Gypsy mouth to my captain.


87
00:15:27.625 --> 00:15:29.594
给你穿上这个。
Let's get this on you.


88
00:16:07.231 --> 00:16:10.025
来吧!灰尘很快。
Come on! Dirt soon enough.


89
00:16:13.303 --> 00:16:15.163
关闭它。
Shut it.


90
00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:27.643
♪翻过这山来
♪ Come over the hills ♪


91

96
00:16:53.778 --> 00:16:55.379
很好。
Very nice.


97
00:16:55.813 --> 00:16:57.573
现在该睡觉了。
Now time for bed.


98
00:18:11.321 --> 00:18:12.690
我想要一间房间过夜。
I'd like a room for the night.


99
00:18:13.558 --> 00:18:14.892
所有的客人都必须在这里登记。
All guests must sign in here.


100
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.789
说明你到过哪里，要去哪里，以及你的业务。
State where you've been, where you're going, and state your business.


101
00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:21.264
小镇的规则。
Town rules.


102
00:18:27.605 --> 00:18:31.141
有吉普赛人在附近的报告吗?
Any reports of Gypsies in the area?


103
00:18:31.943 --> 00:18:35.379
我说了，把你的事说出来。
Like I said, state your business here.


104
00:18:36.246 --> 00:18:39.784
除此之外，食物和啤酒都是免费的。
Other than that, food and ale are included with the room.


105
00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:43.821
请坐，我给你拿点吃的。
Take a seat, I'll bring you some food.


106
00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:21.483
这并没有花很长时间。
That didn't take very long.


107
00:19:21.525 --> 00:19:23.226
是什么出卖了我?
What gave me away?


108
00:19:23.661 --> 00:19:30.802
除了你问的是吉普赛人的事还有你在留言簿上注明你的职业是病理学家，没什么别的。
Other than the fact you're asking about Gypsies and you stated your profession as pathologist in the guest book, not much.


109
00:19:31.636 --> 00:19:34.229
这位好警官不是有事情要处理吗?
Doesn't the good constable have matters to attend to?


110
00:19:34.271 --> 00:19:35.865
这是中尉。
It's lieutenant.


111
00:19:35.907 --> 00:19:38.275
哦，晋升的阶梯。
Oh, climbing the promotion ladder.


112
00:19:38.609 --> 00:19:39.844
给我留下了深刻的印象。
I'm impressed.


113
00:19:41.946 --> 00:19:44.448
我听说了在Gévaudan发生的事。
I heard what happened in Gévaudan.


114
00:19:44.716 --> 00:19:45.683
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.


115
00:19:46.316 --> 00:19:47.685
你过得怎么样?
How have you been?


116
00:19:53.991 --> 00:19:56.317
您打算住多久?
How long will you be staying?


117
00:19:56.359 --> 00:19:58.821
我们需要一个好的病理学家。
We could use a good pathologist 'round here.


118
00:19:58.863 --> 00:20:01.256
最后一个是霍乱。
Cholera got the last one.


119
00:20:01.298 --> 00:20:06.704
如果霍乱是你唯一需要监管的东西，那你就不需要病理学家了，对吧?
Well, if cholera's the only thing you have to police, then you don't need a pathologist, do you?


120
00:21:35.059 --> 00:21:36.594
爱德华!
Edward!


121
00:21:36.861 --> 00:21:38.486
——爱德华!——爱德华!
- Edward! - Edward!


122
00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:40.631
爱德华!
Edward!


123
00:21:41.799 --> 00:21:43.959
爱德华,进去。介绍你自己!
Edward, come inside. Cover yourself!


124
00:21:51.709 --> 00:21:53.368
发生了什么事?
What happened?


125
00:22:01.418 --> 00:22:04.914
四个男孩。婚礼五张，生孩子六张。
Four for a boy. Five for a wedding, six for a birth.


126
00:22:04.956 --> 00:22:07.516
七个是埋在地下的诅咒。
Seven for a curse that's buried in the Earth.


127
00:22:07.558 --> 00:22:09.518
八比银，九比金。
Eight for silver, nine for gold.


128
00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.954
十块钱买一只狼，你不会老的。
Ten for a wolf and you won't die old.


129
00:22:11.996 --> 00:22:13.055
来吧，蒂米，该你了。
Come on, Timmy, it's your go.


130
00:22:18.769 --> 00:22:22.573
一个是悲伤，两个是快乐，三个是女孩，四个是男孩。
One for sorrow, two for joy, three for a girl, four for a boy.


131
00:22:23.107 --> 00:22:25.400
婚礼五张，生孩子六张。
Five for a wedding, six for a birth.


132
00:22:25.442 --> 00:22:27.111
七个是埋在地下的诅咒。
Seven for a curse that's buried in the Earth.


133
00:22:27.945 --> 00:22:29.080
我已经看到它了。
I've seen it.


134
00:22:29.714 --> 00:22:31.048
见过什么?
Seen what?


135
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:38.881
在我们继续前进之前，你必须发誓不告诉任何人。
Before we go any further, you must swear not to tell anyone.


136
00:22:40.925 --> 00:22:44.854
我是认真的，如果你父亲发现了，他会把我的家人赶出和解协议。
I mean it, your father will banish my family from the settlement if he finds out.


137
00:22:47.198 --> 00:22:48.657
——我发誓。——我们发誓。
- I swear. - We swear.


138
00:23:16.027 --> 00:23:17.686
我们不应该在这里。
We're not supposed to be here.


139
00:23:17.728 --> 00:23:22.658
-长老们不允许。-自从那晚这块地着火以后，他们就禁止这样做了。
- The elders forbid it. - They have forbid it ever since the night this field was on fire.


140
00:23:24.268 --> 00:23:30.866
但从那时起…你们有多少人梦见过稻草人和银牙?
But since then... how many of you have dreamt about the scarecrow and the silver teeth?


141
00:23:41.619 --> 00:23:43.679
让我们把这箱财宝挖出来吧。
Let's dig up the box of treasure.


142
00:23:45.723 --> 00:23:47.182
——你害怕。——不!
- You're scared. - Am not!


143
00:23:47.224 --> 00:23:48.525
是的,你是。
Yes, you are.


144
00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:51.921
——面对。-放开他。
- Scaredy-cat. - Leave him alone.


145
00:23:54.165 --> 00:23:55.700
你要把它挖出来吗?
Are you gonna dig it up?


146
00:23:57.134 --> 00:23:58.928
如果你这么勇敢，为什么不把它挖出来?
If you're so brave, why don't you dig it up?


147
00:24:02.206 --> 00:24:03.933
好吧。
All right.


148
00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:05.701
——我会的。-不，蒂米，不要。
- I will. - No, Timmy, don't.


149
00:24:14.251 --> 00:24:15.277
提米。
Timmy.


150
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:20.215
提米,不要。
Timmy, don't.


151
00:24:33.337 --> 00:24:35.698
别碰他，埃迪!
Don't touch him, Eddie!


152
00:24:51.188 --> 00:24:53.749
跑,夏洛特,跑!
Run, Charlotte, run!


153
00:24:53.791 --> 00:24:55.617
离开这里，快跑!
Get out of here, run!


154
00:25:14.178 --> 00:25:16.672
的帮助!
Help!


155
00:25:24.955 --> 00:25:28.751
夏洛特!
Charlotte!


156
00:25:28.793 --> 00:25:30.786
夏洛特，怎么了?
Charlotte, what's the matter?


157
00:25:30.828 --> 00:25:32.621
它是什么?发生了什么事?
What is it? What's happened?


158
00:25:34.732 --> 00:25:36.300
获取医生。
Fetch the doctor.


159
00:25:42.273 --> 00:25:44.341
发生了什么事?他怎么了?
What's happened? What happened to him?


160
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.779
亲爱的，勇敢点，亲爱的。
Darling, just be brave, dear.


161
00:25:50.247 --> 00:25:51.340
在这里。
Here.


162
00:26:11.068 --> 00:26:12.861
这里太黑了。
It's very dark in here.


163
00:26:12.903 --> 00:26:15.806
是的，光线，刺痛了他的眼睛。
Yes, the light, it was hurting his eyes.


164
00:26:16.307 --> 00:26:17.374
正确的。
Right.


165
00:26:18.709 --> 00:26:21.278
我们来看看，好吗?
Let's have a look, shall we?


166
00:26:22.113 --> 00:26:25.049
嗯嗯。
Mm-hm.


167
00:26:30.054 --> 00:26:33.682
爱德华被某种野生动物咬了。
Edward has been bitten by some kind of wild animal.


168
00:26:33.724 --> 00:26:37.086
伤口似乎感染了，而且他发烧了。
The wound does seem to be infected and he has a fever.


169
00:26:37.128 --> 00:26:41.932
我治疗了他的伤口，给了他一些药，让他冷静下来。
I've treated the wound and given him something to, uh, calm him down.


170
00:26:42.967 --> 00:26:45.894
我一两天内会回来看看他。
I shall come back in a day or two and check on him.


171
00:26:45.936 --> 00:26:47.062
谢谢你！
Thank you.


172
00:26:47.104 --> 00:26:48.372
这里。
This way.


173
00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:51.008
谢谢你,医生。
Thank you, Doctor.


174
00:27:34.151 --> 00:27:35.319
快跑!
Run!


175
00:28:18.963 --> 00:28:20.422
爱德华?
Edward?


176
00:28:30.507 --> 00:28:32.067
爱德华?
Edward?


177
00:28:35.913 --> 00:28:37.039
埃迪?
Eddie?


178
00:28:54.164 --> 00:28:55.424
这是爱德华。
It's Edward.


179
00:28:55.466 --> 00:28:57.159
他有点不对劲。
There's something wrong with him.


180
00:28:57.201 --> 00:28:58.528
待在这里。
Stay here.


181
00:29:14.218 --> 00:29:15.944
爱德华?
Edward?


182
00:29:17.855 --> 00:29:19.348
爱德华?
Edward?


183
00:29:21.158 --> 00:29:22.059
爱德华!
Edward!


184
00:29:37.341 --> 00:29:39.067
爱德华!
Edward!


185
00:29:44.114 --> 00:29:45.575
爱德华!
Edward!


186
00:29:52.557 --> 00:29:53.915
爱德华!
Edward!


187
00:30:38.235 --> 00:30:39.470
莫里哀。
Molière.


188
00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:43.633
你是来吹嘘又一次晋升的吧?
Come to boast about another promotion, have you?


189
00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:46.335
从这里骑半天就能到一个庄园。
There's a manor house half a day's ride from here.


190
00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:49.539
他们的儿子失踪了，他们派人来找我。
They've sent for me regarding their son who's gone missing.


191
00:30:49.581 --> 00:30:51.541
那跟我有什么关系?
And what's that to do with me?


192
00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:54.943
不久以前，吉普赛人也有过这样的问题。
There was a Gypsy problem that way not so long ago.


193
00:30:54.985 --> 00:30:58.213
这可能和你一直在寻找的东西有关。
It may be connected to what you've been looking for.


194
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:22.212
嘘!
Psst!


195
00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:46.437
提米?
Timmy?


196
00:31:47.004 --> 00:31:48.972
爱德华出外勤时发生了什么?
What happened to Edward in the field?


197
00:31:50.007 --> 00:31:51.576
你不记得了?
You don't remember?


198
00:31:52.309 --> 00:31:59.709
我只记得他的银牙，然后是一场噩梦，然后…然后，我在地上醒来。
What I remember was the silver teeth and then a nightmare, and then... and then, I woke up on the ground.


199
00:32:02.152 --> 00:32:04.312
你用牙齿咬了爱德华。
You used the teeth to bite Edward.


200
00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:10.686
你和其他人告诉他们发生了什么吗?
Did you and the others tell them what happened?


201
00:32:13.063 --> 00:32:14.264
不。
No.


202
00:32:15.299 --> 00:32:17.259
我们发过誓的，记得吗?
We took an oath, remember?


203
00:32:21.573 --> 00:32:27.579
犹大说、我把他交给你们、你们愿意给我多少钱。
"And Judas asked, 'What are you willing to give me if I deliver him over to you?'


204
00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:35.778
他们给了他三十块钱。”
And they counted out for him 30 pieces of silver."


205
00:32:42.292 --> 00:32:45.162
那银子就是从前给犹大的。
It is the same silver that was given to Judas.


206
00:32:50.367 --> 00:32:52.227
拿着这个，你可能用得着。
Take this, you may need it.


207
00:32:58.676 --> 00:33:00.177
银在哪里?
Where's the silver?


208
00:33:01.144 --> 00:33:02.471
这里的。
It's here.


209
00:33:05.182 --> 00:33:07.409
在圣地。
On holy ground.


210
00:33:11.154 --> 00:33:12.757
我在噩梦中看到了火焰。
I saw the flames in my nightmare.


211
00:33:14.626 --> 00:33:18.621
我们都会为长辈犯下的罪付出代价。
We will all pay for the sins made by our elders.


212
00:33:24.268 --> 00:33:25.761
我们都会死。
We're all going to die.


213
00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:45.715
夏洛特!蒂米想要什么?
Charlotte! What did Timmy want?


214
00:33:48.191 --> 00:33:49.519
来了。
Come.


215
00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:02.598
爱德华!
Edward!


216
00:34:05.743 --> 00:34:07.269
爱德华!
Edward!


217
00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:33.363
美好的一天,先生们。
Good day, sirs.


218
00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:36.299
请跟我来。
Please, follow me.


219
00:35:49.981 --> 00:35:52.784
劳伦特先生马上就来。
Mr. Laurent will be with you shortly.


220
00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:06.388
先生们。谢默斯·洛朗。
Gentlemen. Seamus Laurent.


221
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.289
中尉阿尔弗雷德•莫里哀。
Lieutenant Alfred Molière.


222
00:36:08.331 --> 00:36:10.968
-这位是病理学家。——约翰·迈克布莱德。
- This is the pathologist. - John McBride.


223
00:36:11.769 --> 00:36:14.864
我们已经为您准备好了客房，以防您需要入住。
We have prepared guest rooms for you in case you need to stay.


224
00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:19.902
劳伦特先生，你派人来找我们是因为你儿子失踪的紧急事件。
Mr. Laurent, you sent for us about an urgent matter regarding the disappearance of your son.


225
00:36:19.944 --> 00:36:21.302
是的。
Yes.


226
00:36:21.344 --> 00:36:24.540
但自从我们派人来找你，情况就变得更糟了。
But since we sent for you, things have gotten a lot worse.


227
00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.514
耶稣。
Jesus.


228
00:38:04.447 --> 00:38:08.043
死因与被野兽袭击相符。
Cause of death is consistent with attack by a wild animal.


229
00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:09.812
野生动物吗?
A wild animal?


230
00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:13.490
咬痕的大小和形状表明是狼咬的。
Size and shape of the bite marks suggest a wolf.


231
00:38:14.559 --> 00:38:16.060
他是谁?
Who is he?


232
00:38:16.828 --> 00:38:18.020
亚当斯的男孩。
The Adams boy.


233
00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:20.330
你儿子仍然下落不明?
And your son is still missing?


234
00:38:20.798 --> 00:38:21.924
是的。
Yes.


235
00:38:21.966 --> 00:38:24.126
好。就是这样。
Well. That's that.


236
00:38:24.168 --> 00:38:26.595
我这就回警局报案。
I'll head back to the department and file a report.


237
00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:27.972
是它吗?
Is that it?


238
00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:30.065
你被野兽袭击了。
You have an attack by a wild animal.


239
00:38:30.107 --> 00:38:31.600
你的男孩的失踪。
Your boy's missing.


240
00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:36.105
我不想显得冷漠，但这个国家正处于霍乱大流行之中。
I don't mean to be insensitive, but the country's in the middle of a cholera pandemic.


241
00:38:36.147 --> 00:38:37.882
数以千计的人死亡。
Thousands are dead.


242
00:38:38.983 --> 00:38:40.751
许多城镇正在关闭大门。
Many towns are closing their gates.


243
00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:44.680
贸易路线受到严重影响。
Trade routes heavily affected.


244
00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:46.023
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.


245
00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:48.726
我也无能为力了。
There's nothin' more I can do.


246
00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:52.096
不，如果可以的话，我想再住几天。
No, I'd like to stay on for a few days, if that's all right.


247
00:38:59.502 --> 00:39:01.939
如果你的人来了就告诉我。
Let me know if your boy shows up.


248
00:39:17.154 --> 00:39:19.014
这么说你认识那个男孩。
So you knew the boy.


249
00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:23.728
我的儿子爱德华和女儿夏洛特经常和定居地的孩子们一起玩。
My son Edward and my daughter Charlotte often play with the children from the settlement.


250
00:39:25.162 --> 00:39:29.100
爱德华失踪的那天，你还记得什么?
And on the day Edward went missing, what do you remember?


251
00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.037
他们中的一群人曾和亚当斯的男孩一起在树林里。
A group of them had been in the woods with the Adams boy.


252
00:39:34.504 --> 00:39:37.608
出了什么事，爱德华受伤了。
Something had happened and Edward had been hurt.


253
00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:42.504
等我们把他送回家时，他已经开始发烧了。
And by the time we got him back to the house, he had developed a terrible fever.


254
00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:47.517
有什么东西在树林里袭击了爱德华。
Something had attacked Edward in the woods.


255
00:39:48.518 --> 00:39:49.754
一种动物。
An animal.


256
00:39:51.155 --> 00:39:58.095
他,呃…他身上有咬痕…
He, uh... he had bite marks on his, um...


257
00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:03.466
是的，它们一定来自动物。
Yes, they had to have come from an animal.


258
00:40:05.036 --> 00:40:08.673
夏洛似乎很震惊。她什么都不能告诉我们。
Charlotte seemed to be in shock. She couldn't tell us anything.


259
00:40:10.141 --> 00:40:15.512
那天晚上，我去看他，但他的床是空的，房子里也找不到他。
Later that evening, I went to check on him but his bed was empty and he was nowhere to be found in the house.


260
00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:19.951
从那以后我们就没见过他。
We haven't seen him since.


261
00:40:20.584 --> 00:40:24.221
几天后，亚当家男孩的尸体在树林里被发现。
A few days later, the body of the Adams boy was found in the woods.


262
00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:28.092
麦克布莱德先生，居民区的家庭都吓坏了。
Mr. McBride, the families in the settlement are frightened.


263
00:40:28.693 --> 00:40:32.129
他们受雇于我，住在我的土地上，我要对他们负责。
They are in my employ, they live on my land, and I am responsible for them.


264
00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:34.966
他们指望我来解决这个问题。
They're looking to me to resolve this.


265
00:40:40.271 --> 00:40:43.499
这是我的妻子，伊莎贝尔。
May I present my wife, Isabelle.


266
00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:45.100
这是约翰·麦克布莱德先生。
This is Mr. John McBride.


267
00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:46.877
很高兴见到你，劳伦特夫人。
Very pleased to meet you, Mrs. Laurent.


268
00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:50.480
很遗憾你的爱德华失踪了。
I'm so sorry to hear your Edward is missing.


269
00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:55.577
有没有可能，他只是跑掉了?——没有。
Is it possible - he's just run away? - No.


270
00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:57.212
那可不像爱德华。
That wouldn't be like Edward.


271
00:40:57.254 --> 00:40:59.991
你看，他是一个非常快乐的孩子。
You see, he is a very happy child.


272
00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:03.152
此外，我们到处都找遍了。
Besides, we have searched everywhere.


273
00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:05.187
我们还在找他。
And we are still looking for him.


274
00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:06.731
请帮我们找到他。
Please help us find him.


275
00:41:07.264 --> 00:41:10.526
为什么,是的…我能看看他的房间吗?
Why, yes... uh, may I see his room?


276
00:41:10.568 --> 00:41:11.702
当然可以。
Of course.


277
00:41:30.021 --> 00:41:32.156
我们不得不擦床单。
We had to clean the sheets.


278
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:38.062
爱德华，他…他不舒服。
Edward, he was, um... he was unwell.


279
00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:41.699
我可以看看房子的其他部分吗?
May I see the rest of the house?


280
00:41:43.134 --> 00:41:44.693
当然可以。
Of course.


281
00:41:56.747 --> 00:42:00.809
我下来的时候，这扇门大开着。
When I came down, this door was wide open.


282
00:42:42.093 --> 00:42:44.386
我们得把一楼所有的窗户都钉上。
We need to board all the windows on the ground floor shut.


283
00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:45.796
为什么?
Why?


284
00:42:46.664 --> 00:42:48.357
这只是预防措施。
It's just a precaution.


285
00:43:04.982 --> 00:43:12.147
♬过来吧，我美丽的爱尔兰姑娘
♪ Come over the hills, my bonnie Irish lass ♪


286
00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:19.655
♪到你的爱人身边来吧
♪ Come over the hills to your darling ♪


287
00:43:19.697 --> 00:43:25.360
♪你自己选择的路，爱，而我会…♪♪
♪ You choose the road, love, and I'll... ♪♪


288
00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:30.933
阿奈。
Anais.


289
00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.369
夏洛特。
Charlotte.


290
00:45:30.461 --> 00:45:31.895
约翰?
John?


291
00:47:18.636 --> 00:47:20.070
我们会死吗?
Are we going to die?


292
00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:24.274
当然不是!
Of course not!


293
00:47:25.476 --> 00:47:27.969
我不能容忍餐桌上的这种谈话。
I will not stand for such talk at the table.


294
00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:36.453
麦克布莱德先生是来帮我们找到爱德华的，我们可以通过保持我们的力量和坚定来帮助他。
Mr. McBride is here to help us find Edward, and we can help him by maintaining our strength and remaining steadfast.


295
00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:39.615
现在,请吃。
Now, eat, please.


296
00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:34.704
嗯。
Hm.


297
00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.463
麦克布莱德吗?
McBride?


298
00:49:59.797 --> 00:50:01.323
谢默斯，拿支步枪来。
Seamus, fetch a rifle.


299
00:50:28.893 --> 00:50:31.787
什么样的动物会闯进别人家?
What kind of animal tries to break into houses?


300
00:50:33.798 --> 00:50:35.758
有些东西我需要你帮忙。
There are some things I'm going to need from you.


301
00:50:38.335 --> 00:50:40.295
这里发生了什么?
What's happening here?


302
00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:42.765
我得先设个狩猎场才能确定。
Can't be sure until I set up a hunting ground.


303
00:50:42.807 --> 00:50:44.508
你要猎杀它?
You're gonna hunt it?


304
00:50:49.847 --> 00:50:52.382
我要召集长老们告诉他们你的计划。
I'll need to gather the elders and tell them of your plans.


305
00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.878
我们拥有这个地区所有的土地。
We own all the land in this region.


306
00:50:58.422 --> 00:51:00.750
确保他们有武装人员看守。
Make sure they travel under armed guard.


307
00:51:12.904 --> 00:51:22.614
先生们，你们都知道今晚让我们来到这里的不幸情况，本地孩子被杀，我的儿子爱德华失踪。
Gentlemen, you're all aware of the unfortunate circumstances that have brought us here this evening, the killing of the local child and the disappearance of my own son, Edward.


308
00:51:23.781 --> 00:51:28.485
约翰·麦克布莱德先生好心地提出要帮助抓捕杀死亚当斯男孩的动物。
Mr. John McBride has kindly offered to help capture the animal that killed the Adams boy.


309
00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:33.290
你确定这是某种动物干的，不是疯子干的?
You are sure that this is some kind of animal, not the work of a madman?


310
00:51:34.358 --> 00:51:40.364
在检查了尸体之后，我得出结论，死因与动物咬伤相符。
After examining the body, I concluded that the cause of death had been consistent with an animal bite.


311
00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:43.768
我们说的是哪种动物?
What kind of an animal are we talking about?


312
00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:46.336
狼。
Wolf.


313
00:51:48.372 --> 00:51:50.642
你是一个病理学家。
You're a pathologist.


314
00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:52.702
这是正确的。
That's correct.


315
00:51:52.744 --> 00:51:54.879
这到底是什么意思?
What does that mean, exactly?


316
00:51:55.647 --> 00:51:57.807
即使在我们死后，我们的身体也会说话。
Our body speaks even after our death.


317
00:51:57.849 --> 00:51:58.482
我听。
I listen.


318
00:52:00.618 --> 00:52:02.778
这不是猎人的工作吗?
Isn't it a job for hunters?


319
00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:07.415
我相信我们都读过关于Gévaudan的野兽，也许听过这些故事。
I'm sure we've all read about the Beast of Gévaudan, perhaps heard the stories.


320
00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:10.820
你知道，军队动乱的时候我驻扎在那里。
You see, I was stationed there during the troubles with the army.


321
00:52:10.862 --> 00:52:13.288
你认为在Gévaudan发生的事情在这里也发生了吗?
You think what happened in Gévaudan is happening here?


322
00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:15.691
很可能是。
It might very well be.


323
00:52:15.733 --> 00:52:18.661
那么，这不是军队的工作吗?
Then, isn't this a job for the army?


324
00:52:18.703 --> 00:52:25.543
不幸的是，军队可以……将……只有在确认这里发生了与Gévaudan相同的事情时才会部署。
Unfortunately, the army can... will... only be deployed if there is confirmation that the same thing is happening here as in Gévaudan.


325
00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:32.207
你是在建议我们待在家里，把窗户都钉上吗?
Are you suggesting that we stay inside our house and board the windows shut?


326
00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:34.409
我强烈建议。
I would strongly advise it.


327
00:52:57.307 --> 00:53:00.770
在那个疯子被抓之前任何人都不该出外勤。
No one should be out in the field until that madman is caught.


328
00:53:00.812 --> 00:53:01.971
抱怨是没有用的。
There's no use complaining.


329
00:53:02.013 --> 00:53:03.906
我们抽签决定。
We drew the short straws.


330
00:53:03.948 --> 00:53:08.276
我们搞定这事，就能回家了，好吗?
We get this done, we get ourselves home, all right?


331
00:53:08.318 --> 00:53:10.278
雅各布，你去那边。
Jakob, you take the far side.


332
00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.255
我们往里走，直到中间会合。
We'll work inwards till we meet in the middle.


333
00:53:13.925 --> 00:53:17.227
睁大眼睛。在眼前。
Keep your eyes peeled. Stay in sight.


334
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:19.454
好吧?
All right?


335
00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:57.425
富勒姆·?
Calum?


336
00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:16.812
富勒姆·!
Calum!


337
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:21.893
富勒姆·!
Calum!


338
00:54:37.675 --> 00:54:39.434
雅克布?
Jakob?


339
00:54:42.947 --> 00:54:44.607
雅克布?
Jakob?


340
00:54:48.586 --> 00:54:50.112
雅克布?
Jakob?


341
00:54:57.762 --> 00:54:59.121
雅克布?
Jakob?


342
00:55:17.715 --> 00:55:18.941
雅克布?
Jakob?


343
00:55:34.866 --> 00:55:36.859
雅克布?
Jakob?


344
00:55:57.487 --> 00:55:58.581
快跑!
Run!


345
00:56:06.864 --> 00:56:08.591
的帮助!
Help!


346
00:56:08.633 --> 00:56:10.159
别人的帮助!
Somebody help!


347
00:56:14.639 --> 00:56:15.931
的帮助!
Help!


348
00:56:27.118 --> 00:56:28.619
我们只找到了这些。
This is all we found.


349
00:56:30.187 --> 00:56:33.916
安妮玛丽和卡鲁姆，雅各布一起在地里干活。
Anne-Marie was working the fields with Calum and Jakob.


350
00:56:33.958 --> 00:56:36.552
她回到了和解地点，拉响了警报。
She made it back to the settlement and raised the alarm.


351
00:56:36.594 --> 00:56:41.657
我们回到这里然后…没有卡鲁姆和雅各布。
We came back here and... no Calum and no Jakob.


352
00:56:41.699 --> 00:56:43.058
那女孩看到是什么袭击了他们吗?
Did the girl see what attacked them?


353
00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:46.095
嗯…她震惊了。
Well... she's in shock.


354
00:56:46.137 --> 00:56:47.796
什么……她说的话毫无道理。
What... what she says makes no sense.


355
00:56:47.838 --> 00:56:49.506
她说什么了?
What did she say?


356
00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.976
她说那是一条龙。
She said it was a dragon.


357
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:55.237
她的情况很糟糕，她……她失血过多。
She's in a bad way, she... she's lost a lot of blood.


358
00:56:55.279 --> 00:56:56.881
她被咬吗?
She was bitten?


359
00:56:58.582 --> 00:57:00.175
她在哪里呢?
Where is she?


360
00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.568
她……她刚才还在这儿。
She... she was just here.


361
00:57:21.672 --> 00:57:23.532
每个人都必须离开。
Everyone must leave.


362
00:57:23.574 --> 00:57:25.901
我们不能在野外或村庄里保护他们。
We can't protect them in the field or in the village.


363
00:57:25.943 --> 00:57:27.736
这里已经不安全了。
It's no longer safe here.


364
00:57:27.778 --> 00:57:31.240
-去哪儿?-带他们去教堂，把门关上。
- And go where? - Take them to the church, barricade the door shut.


365
00:57:31.282 --> 00:57:35.611
食物和水可以取用，但必须在武装护卫下。
Food and water can be fetched for, but under armed escort only.


366
00:57:35.653 --> 00:57:37.913
我们必须限制这种暴露。
It is imperative that we limit this exposure.


367
00:57:37.955 --> 00:57:39.223
接触吗?
Exposure?


368
00:57:40.057 --> 00:57:44.628
-接触什么?-谢默斯，你和你的人正在被追杀。
- Exposure to what? - Seamus, you and your people are being hunted.


369
00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:47.089
水，我需要水。
Water, I need water.


370
00:59:22.893 --> 00:59:24.386
对不起。
Sorry.


371
00:59:24.428 --> 00:59:25.387
哦。
Oh.


372
00:59:25.429 --> 00:59:27.198
睡不着。
Can't sleep.


373
00:59:28.899 --> 00:59:30.826
哦,我也没有。
Oh, me neither.


374
00:59:30.868 --> 00:59:31.802
喝点什么吗?
Drink?


375
00:59:35.906 --> 00:59:36.974
是的。
Yes.


376
00:59:48.986 --> 00:59:50.054
伊迪丝是谁?
Who's Edith?


377
00:59:51.956 --> 00:59:53.257
我的妻子。
My wife.


378
00:59:54.825 --> 00:59:56.694
你有孩子吗?
Do you have children?


379
01:00:03.134 --> 01:00:05.069
好像是很久以前的事了。
Seems a long time ago now.


380
01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:07.872
他们不在你身边了吗?
Are they no longer with you?


381
01:00:12.143 --> 01:00:14.311
我们被派驻到Gévaudan。
We'd been stationed to Gévaudan.


382
01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:19.150
他们受到一只狼的骚扰。
They were plagued by a wolf.


383
01:00:21.352 --> 01:00:26.423
第一周就有两人被杀，之后又有六人被杀。
Two people had been killed in the first week, six the following.


384
01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:29.727
军队就是那时被征召进来的。
That's when the army had been drafted in.


385
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:39.336
有传言说狼是诅咒，如果人们想知道。
There was talk that the wolf was a curse, and if people need to know.


386
01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:50.381
我第一次看到它时，它浑身是鲜血，就在我们村子外面。
The first time I saw it, it was covered in fresh blood, just outside our village.


387
01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:54.919
等我回来的时候，已经…太迟了。
By the time I got back there, it was... too late.


388
01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:59.190
有13人被野兽杀死。
Thirteen people had been killed by the beast.


389
01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.893
我的妻子和女儿也在其中。
My wife and daughter were among them.


390
01:01:10.535 --> 01:01:12.469
我很抱歉。
I'm so sorry.


391
01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:28.185
他们抓到这只狼了吗?
Did they ever catch this wolf?


392
01:01:31.222 --> 01:01:36.393
不久之后，一群吉普赛人来到Gévaudan网站。
Shortly after that, a band of traveling gypsies came to Gévaudan.


393
01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:43.234
他们说，诅咒已经复仇了，将用吉卜赛银包住。
They said the curse had had its revenge and was to be contained in gypsy silver.


394
01:01:44.134 --> 01:01:48.005
然后他们向西北行进，但在勒玛齐乌，这条路就变冷了。
They then traveled northwest, but the trail went cold in Le Malzieu.


395
01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:52.309
吉普赛人对我丈夫的土地有所有权。
Well, the gypsies had a claim on my husband's land.


396
01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:55.379
我丈夫和长辈们…够了!
My husband and the elders... That's enough!


397
01:02:01.553 --> 01:02:03.053
这就够了。
That's enough.


398
01:02:04.355 --> 01:02:06.056
我不想再谈诅咒了。
I want no more talk of curses.


399
01:02:06.991 --> 01:02:10.352
我们把所有人都锁在教堂里，没人在田里干活。
We've locked everybody in a church, and I have nobody working the fields.


400
01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.963
如果你是来帮忙的，那就帮帮我。
If you're here to help, then please help.


401
01:02:14.566 --> 01:02:18.961
我只是想让这头野兽或者这只狼或者其他什么东西被抓住并杀死。
I just want this beast or this wolf or whatever it is captured and killed.


402
01:02:19.003 --> 01:02:21.238
明天我将设置陷阱。
Tomorrow I will set the traps.


403
01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:55.873
这到底是什么?
What in God's name is it?


404
01:08:02.814 --> 01:08:07.142
先生们，我必须警告你们，这并不容易。
Gentlemen, I must warn you, this won't be easy.


405
01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.220
——哦,耶稣。-天啊。
- Oh, Jesus. - Oh, my God.


406
01:09:06.878 --> 01:09:08.738
安妮玛丽。-别碰它!
- It's Anne-Marie. - Don't touch it!


407
01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:09.781
她走了。
She's gone.


408
01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.974
他们再也回不来了。
They never come back the same.


409
01:09:16.754 --> 01:09:19.691
这是我们现在能为她做的最好的事了，索尔。
It's the kindest thing we can do for her now, Saul.


410
01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:22.885
她还是个婴儿的时候我就认识她了。
I've known her since she was a baby.


411
01:09:22.927 --> 01:09:24.486
扫罗。
Saul.


412
01:09:26.463 --> 01:09:28.724
扫罗!
Saul!


413
01:09:30.835 --> 01:09:31.803
——扫罗!——扫罗!
- Saul! - Saul!


414
01:09:34.005 --> 01:09:35.698
哦,耶稣基督!
Oh, Jesus Christ!


415
01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:36.832
扫罗!
Saul!


416
01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:40.603
扫罗,她开枪!
Saul, shoot her!


417
01:09:40.645 --> 01:09:41.637
现在就做!
Do it now!


418
01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:00.330
这就是降临在我儿子身上的命运吗?
Is this a fate that has befallen my son?


419
01:10:06.604 --> 01:10:09.598
不能让伊莎贝尔知道这件事，我求你了。
Isabelle must never know about this, I beg you.


420
01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:12.342
还有什么她不知道的?
What else doesn't she know about?


421
01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:16.914
你常做梦吗，西莫?
Do you dream much, Seamus?


422
01:10:17.782 --> 01:10:20.442
Gévaudan的土地被诅咒了。
The land of Gévaudan had been cursed.


423
01:10:20.484 --> 01:10:23.045
晚上，每个人都做同样的梦。
At night, everyone had the same dream.


424
01:10:23.087 --> 01:10:24.287
她是谁?
Who is she?


425
01:10:24.856 --> 01:10:26.048
什么?
What?


426
01:10:26.090 --> 01:10:28.349
那个女人被埋在田里。
The woman buried in the field.


427
01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:30.052
女人……我不知道你在说什么。
Woman... I don't know what you're talking about.


428
01:10:30.094 --> 01:10:32.329
她诅咒这片土地。
She cursed the land.


429
01:10:33.463 --> 01:10:34.623
这是荒谬的。
That's absurd.


430
01:10:34.665 --> 01:10:36.859
你刚才看到的是荒谬的吗?
Is what you just saw absurd?


431
01:10:36.901 --> 01:10:38.527
梦，野兽。
The dreams, the beast.


432
01:10:38.569 --> 01:10:40.930
你被诅咒了，从爱德华开始。
You were cursed, and it started with Edward.


433
01:10:40.972 --> 01:10:43.999
爱德华?爱德华与此事无关。
Edward? Edward had nothing to do with this.


434
01:10:44.041 --> 01:10:46.635
他会不停地杀人。
He will kill and keep on killing.


435
01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:51.073
-爱德华是无辜的。-任何在攻击中幸存的人将会改变，直到诅咒完成它的报复。
- Edward is innocent. - Anyone who survives an attack will change until the curse has had its revenge.


436
01:10:51.115 --> 01:10:56.621
报复吗?是我在为这事对我家人造成的伤害报仇!
Revenge? I am the one seeking revenge for what this thing has done to my family!


437
01:11:00.658 --> 01:11:02.359
这是我开始的，所以我要结束它。
I started this, so I will finish it.


438
01:11:04.128 --> 01:11:06.931
我要亲自追捕它，一劳永逸地了结它。
I will hunt it myself and put an end to it once and for all.


439
01:11:08.833 --> 01:11:11.536
现在你烧了这东西…
Now you burn this thing...


440
01:11:13.971 --> 01:11:15.840
…不管它是什么。
...whatever it is.


441
01:11:21.946 --> 01:11:23.572
火炬。
Get the torch.


442
01:11:45.803 --> 01:11:48.039
请不要离开我们，奶奶。
Please don't leave us, Nana.


443
01:11:55.445 --> 01:11:57.615
继续,夏洛特。
Go on, Charlotte.


444
01:12:35.452 --> 01:12:41.391
伊莎贝尔……埋在地里的那个女人是谁?
Isabelle... Who is the woman buried in the field?


445
01:12:49.834 --> 01:12:55.573
这是唯一一个锁在抽屉里而不是挂在墙上的奖杯。
It's the only trophy that's kept locked in a drawer and not displayed on the wall.


446
01:12:58.075 --> 01:13:00.477
我们必须找到被埋葬的东西。
We must find what was buried.


447
01:13:04.749 --> 01:13:07.885
我们都梦想过能诅咒这片土地的银器。
We've all dreamt of the silver that has cursed this land.


448
01:13:09.787 --> 01:13:13.157
在蒂米的尸体上，我发现了从《圣经》上撕下来的一页。
On the body of Timmy, I found a page torn from the Bible.


449
01:13:14.959 --> 01:13:19.997
他知道一些关于银器的事，因为这里有一段划了线。
He knew something about the silver, as there was a passage underlined.


450
01:13:21.065 --> 01:13:26.637
结3银子怎样熔化在炉中、你们也必照样熔化在城中。
"As silver is melted in the furnace, so will you be melted in its midst;


451
01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:33.836
你就知道我耶和华是将忿怒倒在你身上了。
and you shall know that I, the Lord, have poured out My fury upon you."


452
01:13:40.685 --> 01:13:44.922
以西结海啸。
Ezekiel 22:22.


453
01:13:47.992 --> 01:13:52.663
夏洛特……你有什么能告诉我们的吗?
Charlotte... is there anything you can tell us?


454
01:13:53.597 --> 01:13:55.099
任何东西吗?
Anything at all?


455
01:14:10.982 --> 01:14:16.020
犹大说、我把他交给你们、你们愿意给我多少钱。
"And Judas asked, 'What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him over to you?'


456
01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:19.949
他们就给了他三十块钱。”
So they counted out for him 30 pieces of silver."


457
01:14:23.327 --> 01:14:25.888
梦中的银。
The silver from the dream.


458
01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:29.058
你认为给犹大的是同样的银子。
You believe it was the same silver given to Judas.


459
01:14:31.769 --> 01:14:33.738
银器在哪里?
Where is the silver?


460
01:14:38.809 --> 01:14:40.978
麦克布莱德，开门!
McBride, open the door!


461
01:14:50.154 --> 01:14:52.490
我们都为你的安全祈祷。
We've all prayed for your safety.


462
01:14:52.923 --> 01:14:56.085
有些人已经和西莫一起去猎杀野兽了。
Some of the men have joined Seamus to go and hunt the beast.


463
01:14:56.127 --> 01:14:58.496
我们无法控制谢默斯在做什么或做过什么。
We cannot control what Seamus is doing or has done.


464
01:14:59.096 --> 01:15:01.098
我相信有办法阻止这一切。
I believe there is a way to stop this.


465
01:15:01.766 --> 01:15:04.927
夏洛特……在哪里?
Charlotte... where is it?


466
01:15:27.792 --> 01:15:30.119
索尔，发邮件到Molière。
Saul, send word to Molière.


467
01:15:30.161 --> 01:15:32.588
必须立即部署军队。
The army must be deployed immediately.


468
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:35.900
索尔，我需要一个铁匠。
And, Saul, I need a blacksmith.


469
01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:45.480
明天天一亮我们再试一次。
We'll try again tomorrow at first light.


470
01:18:51.462 --> 01:18:52.487
伊莎贝尔?
Isabelle?


471
01:18:54.164 --> 01:18:55.899
伊莎贝尔?
Isabelle?


472
01:18:57.234 --> 01:18:59.161
你看到我妻子了吗?
Have you seen my wife?


473
01:18:59.203 --> 01:19:01.096
对不起,先生。
I'm sorry, sir.


474
01:19:01.138 --> 01:19:03.265
你怎么了，你病了吗?
What's the matter with you, are you sick?


475
01:19:03.307 --> 01:19:04.408
不,我很好。
No, I'm fine.


476
01:19:04.975 --> 01:19:06.868
去把自己洗干净。
Go and clean yourself up.


477
01:20:21.952 --> 01:20:23.887
一百年。
One hundred.


478
01:20:25.089 --> 01:20:27.057
二百年。
Two hundred.


479
01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:30.427
三百年。
Three hundred.


480
01:20:31.696 --> 01:20:33.530
四百年。
Four hundred.


481
01:20:34.164 --> 01:20:35.991
五百年。
Five hundred.


482
01:20:49.513 --> 01:20:51.148
有人失踪吗?
Is anyone missing?


483
01:20:53.183 --> 01:20:54.885
每个人都在这里。
Everybody's here.


484
01:20:56.153 --> 01:20:57.187
它是什么?
What is it?


485
01:20:58.122 --> 01:21:00.215
女仆在哪儿?
Where is the maid?


486
01:21:00.257 --> 01:21:02.351
她在厨房，怎么了?
She's in the kitchen, why?


487
01:21:08.298 --> 01:21:09.567
我想你应该离开这里。
I think you should leave here.


488
01:21:11.268 --> 01:21:13.629
夏洛特，亲爱的，回你房间去。
Charlotte, darling, please go to your room.


489
01:21:22.079 --> 01:21:23.472
——明天。——不,西莫。
- Tomorrow. - No, Seamus.


490
01:21:23.514 --> 01:21:25.140
我们需要约翰的帮助。
We need John's help.


491
01:21:25.182 --> 01:21:27.943
天一亮我们就再去打猎，结束这一切。
We'll hunt again at first light and put an end to all this.


492
01:21:27.985 --> 01:21:30.513
然后空手而归，就像你今天一样。
And come back empty-handed just like you did today.


493
01:21:30.555 --> 01:21:34.082
像所有的星期一样，军队试图追捕Gévaudan的野兽。
Like all the weeks the army tried to hunt the Beast of Gévaudan.


494
01:21:34.124 --> 01:21:36.084
它想要的是你，谢默斯。
It's you it wants, Seamus.


495
01:21:36.126 --> 01:21:37.027
你和你的家人。
You and your kin.


496
01:21:37.862 --> 01:21:39.555
死或锁都没有区别。
Dead or chains makes no difference.


497
01:21:39.597 --> 01:21:43.325
你不用去找它，因为它会因为你的所作所为而找你。
You don't have to go hunt for it, because it will hunt you for what you've done.


498
01:21:43.367 --> 01:21:45.595
我所做的一切都是为了我的家人。
What I did I did for my family.


499
01:21:45.637 --> 01:21:48.664
吉普赛人，他们对这片土地有所有权，不是吗?
The gypsies, they had a claim to the land, didn't they?


500
01:21:48.706 --> 01:21:50.941
-那是我的土地。-你从他们那里偷来的!
- It was my land. - And you stole it from them!


501
01:21:51.208 --> 01:21:53.603
-我失去了我的儿子!-现在你知道贪婪的代价了。
- And I lost my son! - Now you know the cost of greed.


502
01:21:53.645 --> 01:21:56.405
我的妻儿因为你这样的人付出了代价!
My wife and child paid the price because of men like you!


503
01:21:56.447 --> 01:21:58.081
请,请。
Please, please.


504
01:21:59.450 --> 01:22:01.544
我只想找到我的爱德华。
I just want to find my Edward.


505
01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:05.122
是的。
Yes.


506
01:22:07.057 --> 01:22:10.060
你为什么不问问你丈夫他在哪里?
Why don't you ask your husband where he is?


507
01:22:12.764 --> 01:22:13.964
出去。
Get out.


508
01:22:15.567 --> 01:22:20.538
谢默斯，我一直以为我在追踪那只带走我家人的野兽。
You know, Seamus, all this time I thought I was tracking the beast that took my family.


509
01:22:21.539 --> 01:22:24.308
但现在我意识到我完全错了。
But now I realize I got it all wrong.


510
01:22:24.676 --> 01:22:31.674
我只是个看守者，确保在更多无辜的人被杀之前把这些东西都放回盒子里。
I'm just the caretaker, making sure it all gets put back in the box before any more innocent people are killed.


511
01:22:34.284 --> 01:22:36.445
军队来之前我要待在这里。
I'm staying here until the army arrives.


512
01:23:17.729 --> 01:23:19.589
我想念爱德华。
I miss Edward.


513
01:23:28.272 --> 01:23:30.432
你今晚能和我一起住吗?
Can you stay with me here tonight?


514
01:23:30.474 --> 01:23:31.567
当然,亲爱的。
Of course, darling.


515
01:26:19.711 --> 01:26:21.244
阿?
Anais?


516
01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:43.935
阿?
Anais?


517
01:27:47.799 --> 01:27:49.399
你看见西莫了吗?
Have you seen Seamus?


518
01:28:17.394 --> 01:28:18.754
伊莎贝尔!
Isabelle!


519
01:28:18.796 --> 01:28:19.955
伊莎贝尔!
Isabelle!


520
01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.801
夏洛特!
Charlotte!


521
01:28:24.836 --> 01:28:26.929
夏洛特,伊莎贝尔!
Charlotte, Isabelle!


522
01:28:26.971 --> 01:28:27.805
伊莎贝尔!
Isabelle!


523
01:28:30.808 --> 01:28:32.635
谢默斯!
Seamus!


524
01:28:35.179 --> 01:28:37.640
是谢默斯，他出去了。
It's Seamus, he's gone outside.


525
01:28:37.682 --> 01:28:40.643
他出去了……发现夏洛特。
He's out... Find Charlotte.


526
01:28:40.685 --> 01:28:42.578
房子着火了，快走!
The house is on fire, go!


527
01:28:47.091 --> 01:28:48.517
谢默斯!
Seamus!


528
01:28:51.662 --> 01:28:52.922
谢默斯!
Seamus!


529
01:28:54.632 --> 01:28:55.825
谢默斯!
Seamus!


530
01:29:17.054 --> 01:29:18.180
夏洛特。
Charlotte.


531
01:29:21.926 --> 01:29:23.786
夏洛特，我们得离开这房子。
Charlotte, we must leave the house.


532
01:29:27.464 --> 01:29:28.891
谢默斯!
Seamus!


533
01:29:34.471 --> 01:29:35.865
西莫。
Seamus.


534
01:29:49.587 --> 01:29:51.521
这是他的。
It was Anais.


535
01:29:52.489 --> 01:29:53.716
我拍摄它。
I shot it.


536
01:29:59.163 --> 01:30:01.999
我每晚都能看到火焰，约翰。
I see the flames every night, John.


537
01:30:02.934 --> 01:30:03.935
我被咬。
I was bitten.


538
01:30:05.836 --> 01:30:07.162
我将改变。
I'll change.


539
01:30:07.204 --> 01:30:12.467
告诉伊莎贝尔和夏洛特我非常非常抱歉。
Tell Isabelle and Charlotte I'm so, so sorry.


540
01:30:12.509 --> 01:30:13.936
不，不，等等!
No, no, wait, wait!


541
01:31:57.314 --> 01:31:59.608
伊莎贝尔,夏洛特。
Isabelle, Charlotte.


542
01:31:59.650 --> 01:32:00.809
来吧!
Come on!


543
01:32:04.822 --> 01:32:06.715
等待,谢默斯在哪里?
Wait, where's Seamus?


544
01:32:10.795 --> 01:32:12.321
我们得去教堂。
We have to get to the church.


545
01:32:12.363 --> 01:32:14.823
这是唯一安全的地方。我们走吧。
It's the only safe place. Let's go.


546
01:32:17.668 --> 01:32:18.994
来吧!
Come on!


547
01:32:19.036 --> 01:32:20.171
我们走吧!
Let's go!


548
01:32:41.058 --> 01:32:42.117
来,来,来。
Come, come, come.


549
01:33:03.714 --> 01:33:04.949
娜娜吗?
Nana?


550
01:33:05.883 --> 01:33:07.885
趴下，趴下。
Get down, get down.


551
01:33:13.290 --> 01:33:15.693
别动，别动。
Stay still, stay still.


552
01:33:26.303 --> 01:33:27.362
娜娜吗?
Nana?


553
01:33:34.879 --> 01:33:36.705
夏洛特，你必须安静。
Charlotte, you must be quiet.


554
01:33:40.184 --> 01:33:41.176
呆在这里。
Stay right there.


555
01:33:58.769 --> 01:34:00.037
银。
Silver.


556
01:34:03.073 --> 01:34:05.167
起来，起来!
Get up, get up!


557
01:34:05.209 --> 01:34:06.410
快点，走，走!
Come on, move, go!


558
01:34:07.411 --> 01:34:08.837
来了。
Come.


559
01:34:13.117 --> 01:34:15.210
跟在我后面，朝教堂走。
Stay behind me and move towards the church.


560
01:34:15.252 --> 01:34:17.846
移动,走,走。
Move, go, go.


561
01:34:45.816 --> 01:34:46.942
让我们进去!
Let us in!


562
01:34:48.052 --> 01:34:49.811
让我们进去!
Let us in!


563
01:34:53.424 --> 01:34:55.784
-让我们进去!-开门!
- Let us in! - Open the door!


564
01:34:55.826 --> 01:34:57.252
打开这扇门!
Open the door!


565
01:35:02.233 --> 01:35:03.734
关上门。
Close the door.


566
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:07.371
发生了什么事?
What's happened?


567
01:35:09.440 --> 01:35:11.200
庄园着火了。
The manor is on fire.


568
01:35:11.242 --> 01:35:12.776
和西莫?
And Seamus?


569
01:35:14.278 --> 01:35:15.512
他没能活下来。
He didn't make it.


570
01:35:16.146 --> 01:35:17.839
我们差点没到这儿。
We barely made it here.


571
01:35:17.881 --> 01:35:19.817
它一路跟踪我们。
It stalked us the whole way.


572
01:35:20.251 --> 01:35:22.512
就剩下你一个人了吗?
Were you all that is left?


573
01:35:22.554 --> 01:35:23.921
Aye.

574
01:35:24.321 --> 01:35:26.114
那我们现在怎么办?
So what do we do now?


575
01:35:26.156 --> 01:35:28.250
——我们等待。——等待?
- We wait. - Wait?


576
01:35:28.292 --> 01:35:29.793
等待什么?
Wait for what?


577
01:35:30.227 --> 01:35:33.230
不，不，我厌倦了等待，厌倦了躲藏。
No, no, I'm tired of waiting, hiding.


578
01:35:34.932 --> 01:35:36.467
我们就像羊。
We're like sheep.


579
01:35:37.868 --> 01:35:42.864
如果你是说杀死我儿子的东西就在门外，我说，我说我们出去杀了它。
If you're telling me the thing that killed my son is just outside those doors, I say, I say we go outside and we kill it.


580
01:35:42.906 --> 01:35:44.500
你要是出去，就死定了。
You go out those doors and you will be dead.


581
01:35:47.244 --> 01:35:49.480
你怎么来到这里的?你没有死。
How come you made it here? You're not dead.


582
01:35:50.147 --> 01:35:51.949
我有它害怕的东西。
I have something it's afraid of.


583
01:35:53.017 --> 01:35:53.917
什么?
What?


584
01:35:54.552 --> 01:35:56.311
我有灵丹妙药。
I have the silver bullet.


585
01:35:56.353 --> 01:36:00.583
但我们得等到天亮，把它引到开阔的地方，然后瞄准。
But we have to wait for daylight, draw it into the open and have a clean shot.


586
01:36:00.625 --> 01:36:02.393
这是我们唯一的希望。
That is our only hope.


587
01:36:04.028 --> 01:36:06.121
我们收到通知Molière。
We got word to Molière.


588
01:36:06.163 --> 01:36:08.423
军队明早就会到。
The army will be here by morning.


589
01:36:08.465 --> 01:36:10.401
——这很好。——现在休息。
- That's good. - Now rest.


590
01:36:11.969 --> 01:36:14.129
今晚还有很长的路要走。
We've got a long night ahead of us.


591
01:36:38.228 --> 01:36:40.097
我相信这是你儿子的。
I believe this belonged to your boy.


592
01:37:13.263 --> 01:37:15.532
谢默斯怎么了?
What happened to Seamus?


593
01:37:18.202 --> 01:37:19.637
这是他的。
It was Anais.


594
01:37:22.106 --> 01:37:25.042
我到他那里时，他受了重伤。
He was badly wounded when I got to him.


595
01:37:27.679 --> 01:37:33.384
他让我告诉你和夏洛特他很抱歉。
He told me to tell you and Charlotte... that he was sorry.


596
01:37:40.391 --> 01:37:42.960
爱德华在这场噩梦中迷失了吗?
Is Edward lost to this nightmare?


597
01:37:54.071 --> 01:37:55.906
我不能说。
I can't say.


598
01:38:14.592 --> 01:38:17.227
我子民的罪孽玷污了。
The sins of my people have soiled.


599
01:38:18.763 --> 01:38:24.669
但现在我以母亲的身份来找你，请原谅我的悲伤。
But now I come to you as a mother, aching the weight of my grief, please.


600
01:38:25.703 --> 01:38:31.133
我能给你的一切，任何道路，请告诉我，求你了。
Anything I can give, any path, please show me, I beg you.


601
01:38:31.175 --> 01:38:34.169
饶了我们吧，如果还有希望，请饶了我。
Show us mercy, if there is any hope, please show me.


602
01:38:34.211 --> 01:38:35.680
求你，主，怜悯我们吧。
I beg you, Lord, show us mercy.


603
01:39:44.782 --> 01:39:46.576
求你别离开我们，别走!
Please don't leave us, don't go!


604
01:39:46.618 --> 01:39:48.443
请妈妈!
Please, Mother!


605
01:39:48.485 --> 01:39:49.687
爱德华。
Edward.


606
01:39:51.221 --> 01:39:53.516
妈妈，求你了，求你了，快来救我!
Mother, please, please, come get me!


607
01:39:53.558 --> 01:39:54.692
妈妈!
Mother!


608
01:39:56.493 --> 01:39:57.820
爱德华。
Edward.


609
01:39:57.862 --> 01:40:01.064
爱德华,我来了。
Edward, I'm coming.


610
01:40:03.233 --> 01:40:04.727
伊莎贝尔!
Isabelle!


611
01:40:04.769 --> 01:40:06.094
不!
No!


612
01:40:08.238 --> 01:40:09.699
妈妈!
Mother!


613
01:40:18.282 --> 01:40:19.675
回来!
Get back!


614
01:40:21.451 --> 01:40:22.578
动!
Move!


615
01:41:29.587 --> 01:41:31.421
够了!
Enough!


616
01:41:32.189 --> 01:41:34.358
——伊莎贝尔。- - - - - -爱德华。
- Isabelle. - Edward.


617
01:41:35.627 --> 01:41:37.260
让开。
Move out of the way.


618
01:41:37.929 --> 01:41:40.898
快来接我!
Please come get me!


619
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:43.559
不。
No.


620
01:41:43.601 --> 01:41:44.602
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.


621
01:43:52.930 --> 01:43:55.524
把他们从教堂地板上捡起来。
Picked them up off the church floor.


622
01:44:02.607 --> 01:44:04.834
他什么都不记得了。
He doesn't remember anything.


623
01:44:08.613 --> 01:44:09.513
爱德华。
Edward.


624
01:44:10.581 --> 01:44:11.749
的儿子。
Son.


625
01:44:13.483 --> 01:44:16.621
你和你妹妹现在要来和我住在一起。
You and your sister are going to come and live with me now.


626
01:44:17.521 --> 01:44:18.881
好吧?
All right?


627
01:44:24.929 --> 01:44:27.757
这一切都不是你的错，儿子。
None of this was your fault, son.


628
01:44:33.938 --> 01:44:35.540
好吧。
All right.


629
01:44:36.373 --> 01:44:37.975
你去。
Up you go.


630
01:44:38.776 --> 01:44:39.744
夏洛特。
Charlotte.


631
01:44:43.548 --> 01:44:44.582
夏洛特。
Charlotte.


632
01:44:51.155 --> 01:44:52.581
它的时间。
It's time.
