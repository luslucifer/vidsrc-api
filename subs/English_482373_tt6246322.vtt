00:03:20.724 --> 00:03:21.826
Yes.

4
00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:30.102
You failed.

5
00:03:30.235 --> 00:03:31.269
I didn't.

6
00:03:33.438 --> 00:03:35.373
The gun is in my hand.

7
00:03:36.441 --> 00:03:37.943
I thought I had it.

8
00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:42.314
Sorry, Father.
I'll make it next time.


9
00:03:42.447 --> 00:03:44.648
Never take anything
for granted.


10
00:03:45.783 --> 00:03:47.285
God will take it from you.

11
00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.555
Is God bad?

12
00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.160
God is fair.

13
00:03:58.997 --> 00:04:01.799
You almost got
me, didn't you, boy?


14
00:04:22.254 --> 00:04:24.322
Did I get my white hair from you

15
00:04:24.456 --> 00:04:25.656
or from Mom?

16
00:04:28.326 --> 00:04:29.727
From your mother.

17
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.796
I can't believe we don't have
any pictures of her.


18
00:04:32.931 --> 00:04:35.066
Everything was destroyed
in the fire.


19
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.734
You know that.

20
00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:38.603
I could only save you.

21
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.509
Was she beautiful?

22
00:04:49.847 --> 00:04:51.116
She was smart.

23
00:04:53.784 --> 00:04:55.053
Like you.

24
00:04:56.221 --> 00:04:57.522
How many did I get?

25
00:04:57.656 --> 00:04:59.024
All of them.

26
00:05:01.526 --> 00:05:04.496
So I get to go
to town today, right?


27
00:05:07.332 --> 00:05:09.034
You failed survival.

28
00:05:10.868 --> 00:05:12.637
It's been three months.

29
00:05:14.105 --> 00:05:17.475
Plus, I just gave you
a killer haircut.


30
00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:19.177
Trust me.

31
00:05:21.112 --> 00:05:23.982
You need to pass
all your tests first.


32
00:05:36.228 --> 00:05:38.897
All right,
apart from the usual,


33
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.600
I have an order of
five ferns,


34
00:05:41.732 --> 00:05:42.901
two ficuses,

35
00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:45.403
and the
<i>Columnea grandiosa.</i>


36
00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:47.738
<i>Gloriosa.</i>

37
00:05:47.871 --> 00:05:49.840
<i>Gloriosa.</i>

38
00:05:49.975 --> 00:05:51.742
Am I taking Phoenix today?

39
00:05:51.875 --> 00:05:52.911
Not today.

40
00:05:53.044 --> 00:05:54.745
It's been a while.

41
00:05:54.878 --> 00:05:56.147
I said, no.

42
00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:02.420
You either loosen up
that leash,


43
00:06:02.554 --> 00:06:04.990
or sooner or later,
she's gonna bite it off.


44
00:06:19.104 --> 00:06:20.372
Go with Hernandez.

45
00:06:25.043 --> 00:06:26.578
Back by sunset!

46
00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:27.979
I will.

47
00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:33.685
Hey, Hernandez.

48
00:06:33.817 --> 00:06:35.520

You made that up?

56
00:07:00.945 --> 00:07:03.982
I think my mom sang it to me
when I was little.


57

That first part's
all I remember.

You wanna pay her a visit?

59

- But my father doesn't want me...

I snap my fingers

and he'll bite
your testicles off.

Who said you did?

105
00:11:05.523 --> 00:11:07.392
I'll see you around.

106
00:11:07.525 --> 00:11:09.160
Come on, Shadow.

107
00:11:16.568 --> 00:11:18.003
You okay?

108
00:11:18.136 --> 00:11:19.070
Yes.

109
00:11:19.203 --> 00:11:20.738
Just a weirdo.

110
00:11:20.872 --> 00:11:22.707
Yeah.

111
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:25.410
No shortage of those
around here.


112
00:11:39.424 --> 00:11:40.558
Follow them.

113
00:11:51.102 --> 00:11:52.938
Thanks, Hernandez.

114
00:11:53.072 --> 00:11:55.473
We had a lot of fun today.

115
00:11:55.607 --> 00:11:57.910
I'll take her again next week
if you're okay with it.


116
00:11:58.043 --> 00:11:59.277
No.

117
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.845
Today was enough.

118
00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:09.420
- It's none of my business, but...
- You're right.


119
00:12:10.788 --> 00:12:11.991
It's not.

120
00:12:14.927 --> 00:12:16.461
You're a bad man.

121
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.432
A man who's done
terrible things.


122
00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:28.907
At least, I know you think that.

123
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:31.342
Just like sometimes
I do about myself.

War changes us all.

No soul returns holy from it.

126
00:12:41.152 --> 00:12:42.787
Don't make her pay for that.

127
00:12:46.824 --> 00:12:48.060
Thanks.

128
00:14:00.032 --> 00:14:04.069
You mind moving your vehicle
off the road, please?


129
00:14:04.203 --> 00:14:05.603
This is...

130
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.641
This is the only road
back to town.


131
00:14:12.177 --> 00:14:13.078
You served?

132
00:14:13.212 --> 00:14:14.779
Yeah.

133
00:14:14.913 --> 00:14:16.181
We all did too.

134
00:14:17.415 --> 00:14:19.417
- Iraq?
- Yeah.


135
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.621
Dishonorably discharged
from a dishonorable war.


136
00:14:25.823 --> 00:14:30.062
I'd say that makes us
honorable somehow. Wouldn't you?


137
00:14:30.195 --> 00:14:31.462
No.

138
00:14:33.165 --> 00:14:36.434
Can you move your truck
off the road now?


139
00:14:40.038 --> 00:14:41.907
Sure, baby.

140
00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.109
Whatever you want.

141
00:15:56.681 --> 00:15:59.084
Lessons next month.

142
00:16:00.185 --> 00:16:01.552
Okay.

143
00:16:01.686 --> 00:16:05.157
I wanna go to school next year.

144
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:07.391
- This is school...
- A real school,


145
00:16:07.525 --> 00:16:08.860
with other kids like me.

146
00:16:08.994 --> 00:16:10.528
Homeschool is safer.

147
00:16:10.661 --> 00:16:12.496
I don't wanna be safe.

148
00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:15.366
I wanna be normal.
I wanna have friends.


149
00:16:15.499 --> 00:16:17.835
- I wanna live a...
- Enough!


150
00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:19.204
Enough.

151
00:16:20.939 --> 00:16:23.674
I already lost a daughter once.

152
00:16:23.808 --> 00:16:25.443
I'm not losing you.

153
00:16:25.576 --> 00:16:27.179
But I'm lonely.

154
00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:31.649
You have no idea
what it is to be alone.


155
00:16:33.384 --> 00:16:34.920
You have me.

156
00:16:38.856 --> 00:16:40.391
You're not enough.

Shadow.

165
00:27:13.324 --> 00:27:14.826
Go get the girl.

166
00:27:30.241 --> 00:27:31.209

00:30:22.213 --> 00:30:23.848
Open your jaw.

172
00:30:23.982 --> 00:30:26.584
Stay still.

173
00:30:30.822 --> 00:30:32.191
Breathe, brother.

174
00:30:50.209 --> 00:30:52.211
The guy's a Navy SEAL.

175
00:31:07.192 --> 00:31:09.293
Fucking dead SEAL, bro.

176
00:32:10.222 --> 00:32:11.924
Better get out of there, kid.

177
00:32:23.936 --> 00:32:26.337
He's down there with you!

178
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:29.208
Blind fuck is down there!

179
00:32:46.691 --> 00:32:47.893
Call Raylan.

180
00:33:23.628 --> 00:33:26.265
Metal box
is almost full of water.


181
00:33:29.567 --> 00:33:31.303
You prefer
to see the kid alive...


182
00:33:33.906 --> 00:33:35.406
you come in here.

183
00:33:38.442 --> 00:33:39.912
You think I'm fucking with you?

184
00:33:44.548 --> 00:33:45.816
No.

185
00:33:47.953 --> 00:33:50.322
There's a live wire
about to reach the water.


186
00:33:50.454 --> 00:33:52.324
Come out, or she's fried!

187
00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.308
Clever fuck.

188
00:34:10.375 --> 00:34:11.809
No guns, huh?

189
00:34:13.045 --> 00:34:14.413
No problem.

190
00:36:50.068 --> 00:36:51.303
You're tough.

191
00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.406
But you're done.

192
00:37:06.351 --> 00:37:07.419
What the fuck?

193
00:37:07.552 --> 00:37:08.954
Yo, bro.

194
00:38:27.132 --> 00:38:30.035
Breathe.

195
00:38:30.168 --> 00:38:31.369
Come on, breathe.

196
00:38:31.503 --> 00:38:34.406
Breathe.

197
00:38:34.539 --> 00:38:35.739
Breathe.

198
00:38:41.745 --> 00:38:44.115
The old blind man did this?

199
00:38:44.249 --> 00:38:45.716
Uh-huh.

200
00:38:48.653 --> 00:38:49.753
Let's go.

201
00:39:06.404 --> 00:39:08.039
I can walk.

202
00:39:08.173 --> 00:39:09.641
I said, I can walk.

203
00:39:12.843 --> 00:39:14.246
What's happening?

204
00:39:25.924 --> 00:39:27.058
Cover the exits.

205
00:39:39.504 --> 00:39:41.473
What the fuck?

206
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:10.635
They're still down here.

207
00:40:41.099 --> 00:40:42.367
What's happening?

208
00:40:43.834 --> 00:40:45.970
- Who are they?
- I don't know.


209
00:41:30.448 --> 00:41:33.017
You don't need to be
afraid, little girl.


210
00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.089
This has all just been
one big misunderstanding.


211
00:41:49.768 --> 00:41:51.903
It's not me
you need to be scared of...


212
00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.912
but the man
standing next to you.


213
00:42:03.615 --> 00:42:05.784
Now, I don't know who he is.

214
00:42:09.187 --> 00:42:10.555
But I know who he's not.

215
00:42:19.731 --> 00:42:21.199
Should I tell her or you?

216
00:42:28.506 --> 00:42:30.308
Finish him, bro.

217
00:42:30.442 --> 00:42:32.076
No!

218
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:35.313
- Dad! Dad, wake up.
- Aren't you something?


219
00:42:36.848 --> 00:42:37.982
Let me go!

220
00:42:40.084 --> 00:42:41.152
Come on.

221
00:42:42.253 --> 00:42:43.154
No, it's okay.

222
00:42:47.225 --> 00:42:49.093
Yeah, there you go.

223
00:42:49.227 --> 00:42:51.463
There you go.

224
00:42:51.596 --> 00:42:53.832
You really don't remember me,
do you?


225
00:42:55.266 --> 00:42:56.968
Maybe this will help.

226
00:43:07.645 --> 00:43:08.780
See?

227
00:43:13.685 --> 00:43:14.886
What...?

228
00:43:17.789 --> 00:43:20.658
Years ago, there was
a fire in our house.


229
00:43:20.792 --> 00:43:22.861
Cops blamed me.

230
00:43:22.994 --> 00:43:24.362
I spent eight years in prison,

231
00:43:24.496 --> 00:43:26.364
wondering if
I'd ever see you again.


232
00:43:30.502 --> 00:43:32.637
I didn't even know
if you were dead or alive.


233
00:43:37.675 --> 00:43:40.378
<i>This creep here must have...</i>

234
00:43:40.512 --> 00:43:42.380
<i>found you
and kept you for himself.</i>


235
00:43:44.115 --> 00:43:45.985
<i>Up next in local news,</i>

236
00:43:46.117 --> 00:43:49.120
<i>a meth lab caught fire
in west Detroit this morning.</i>


237
00:43:49.254 --> 00:43:51.890
<i>Police were able
to arrest the primary suspect.</i>


238
00:43:52.023 --> 00:43:54.894
<i>The man was taken into custody
and could face charges</i>


239
00:43:55.026 --> 00:43:56.761
<i>for a large number of crimes
committed</i>


240
00:43:56.896 --> 00:43:59.397
- <i>over the past several years.</i>
- <i>You have no idea</i>


241
00:43:59.531 --> 00:44:02.166
<i>how much I've been waiting
for this moment.</i>


242
00:44:17.515 --> 00:44:18.951
Did he hurt you?

243
00:44:21.319 --> 00:44:22.854
But he did steal you
away from me,


244
00:44:22.988 --> 00:44:24.924
and now he must die,
you understand?


245
00:44:27.125 --> 00:44:28.693
Kill him.

246
00:44:28.826 --> 00:44:30.828
- No.
- Fuck are you doing?


247
00:44:30.963 --> 00:44:33.498
Not in front of my kid.
Do it outside.


248
00:44:39.203 --> 00:44:41.839
Wake up, you blind fuck.

249
00:44:43.174 --> 00:44:46.077
Oh! Fuck!

250
00:45:08.433 --> 00:45:09.834
Fucking coward.

251
00:45:16.774 --> 00:45:19.277
Take her to the truck
while I hunt this motherfucker.


252
00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:21.112
Let's go.

253
00:45:26.751 --> 00:45:29.387
- Let me go!
- What's wrong with you?


254
00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.788
Fucking wanna go home?

255
00:45:57.148 --> 00:45:58.650
I don't care who you are.

256
00:45:58.783 --> 00:46:01.486
I'm gonna teach you
some fucking manners, yo.


257
00:46:01.619 --> 00:46:04.555
You ungrateful, little bitch.

258
00:46:22.373 --> 00:46:23.675
No.

259
00:46:31.783 --> 00:46:33.551
Stop.

260
00:46:33.685 --> 00:46:35.486
Please!

261
00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.288
Stop!

262
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:54.006
Move. Go, go.

263
00:46:54.139 --> 00:46:56.175
Move. Now.

264
00:47:24.002 --> 00:47:25.636
Move!

265
00:47:38.016 --> 00:47:39.550
I'm sorry, man.

266
00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.288
- He's back in the house.
- I know.


267
00:47:44.422 --> 00:47:46.390
He wants us to follow him.

268
00:47:48.726 --> 00:47:50.695
Enough of these silly games.

269
00:48:08.147 --> 00:48:09.647
It's his jacket.

270
00:48:11.749 --> 00:48:12.951
Attaboy.

271
00:48:13.085 --> 00:48:13.986
Attaboy.

272
00:48:15.988 --> 00:48:16.989
Wait.

273
00:48:17.122 --> 00:48:18.322
Stop.

274
00:48:20.625 --> 00:48:21.927
Is it true?

275
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.128
Move.

276
00:48:23.262 --> 00:48:24.695
What's my real name?

277
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:26.031
Get over here now!

278
00:48:26.165 --> 00:48:27.498
When's my birthday?

279
00:48:27.632 --> 00:48:29.500
- My real one?
- Stop it!


280
00:48:29.634 --> 00:48:30.936
No, you stop it!

281
00:48:40.611 --> 00:48:42.346
Go!

282
00:49:50.681 --> 00:49:51.749
Hey.

283
00:51:11.762 --> 00:51:13.432
Phoenix!

284
00:51:13.564 --> 00:51:16.301
Calm down, girl.

285
00:51:18.769 --> 00:51:20.005
Calm down.

286
00:51:40.325 --> 00:51:41.492
Stay.

287
00:51:56.975 --> 00:51:58.509
Put her in the truck.

288
00:52:22.034 --> 00:52:23.502
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

289
00:52:25.703 --> 00:52:27.605
What are you doing?

290
00:52:27.738 --> 00:52:30.242
- Your dog's in there.
- Dog's dead.


291
00:52:30.375 --> 00:52:31.910
You don't know that.

292
00:52:32.044 --> 00:52:33.912
You wanna go and find out?

293
00:53:30.936 --> 00:53:32.304
No!

294
00:56:27.379 --> 00:56:29.147
Good morning, princess.

295
00:56:37.555 --> 00:56:38.856
How you feeling?

296
00:56:43.928 --> 00:56:45.096
You all right?

297
00:56:47.065 --> 00:56:48.466
Wanna sit with me?

298
00:56:50.235 --> 00:56:52.103
Come, sit with me. Come on.

299
00:56:53.438 --> 00:56:55.340
Yeah.

300
00:56:55.473 --> 00:56:56.975
There you go.

301
00:56:57.108 --> 00:56:58.143
There you go.

302
00:56:59.311 --> 00:57:00.578
Yeah.

303
00:57:06.985 --> 00:57:08.286
Door's open.

304
00:57:09.721 --> 00:57:11.289
Not a prisoner anymore.

305
00:57:12.991 --> 00:57:15.660
You mean, I can go?

306
00:57:17.429 --> 00:57:18.697
If you want.

307
00:57:20.765 --> 00:57:22.467
Or you can stay here

308
00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:24.469
and find out
who you really are.


309
00:57:32.876 --> 00:57:35.213
Do I have
any brothers or sisters?


310
00:57:37.615 --> 00:57:39.417
Unfortunately, no.

311
00:57:41.852 --> 00:57:43.722
When's my birthday?

312
00:57:43.854 --> 00:57:45.256
February 20th.

313
00:57:47.625 --> 00:57:49.427
What was my mother's name?

314
00:57:51.629 --> 00:57:52.897
Josephine.

315
00:57:54.265 --> 00:57:55.700
Do I look like her?

316
00:57:59.304 --> 00:58:00.338
Yeah.

317
00:58:02.974 --> 00:58:04.309
You do.

318
00:58:06.711 --> 00:58:07.878
Tara.

319
00:58:09.114 --> 00:58:10.548
That's your real name.

320
00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:13.485
Tara.

321
00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:17.322
Everything that man
told you is a lie.


322
00:58:18.656 --> 00:58:20.091
What happened to him?

323
00:58:21.559 --> 00:58:22.927
He got what he deserved.

324
00:58:25.163 --> 00:58:28.099
Hey. I'm not sorry.

325
00:58:28.233 --> 00:58:30.135
You shouldn't be either.

326
00:58:30.268 --> 00:58:31.536
I wanna go.

327
00:58:32.871 --> 00:58:34.639
Where? Where you gonna go?

328
00:58:34.773 --> 00:58:36.875
There's a shelter I know.

329
00:58:38.376 --> 00:58:39.944
Like I said,

330
00:58:40.078 --> 00:58:41.880
you're not a prisoner anymore.

344
01:01:16.067 --> 01:01:17.402
Mom?

345
01:01:19.537 --> 01:01:20.672
Like I said...

346
01:01:22.007 --> 01:01:23.675
everything he told you
was a lie.


347
01:01:36.387 --> 01:01:37.755
My Tara?

348
01:01:42.794 --> 01:01:44.262
You...

349
01:01:44.395 --> 01:01:47.066
got so big, heh.

350
01:01:51.135 --> 01:01:52.570
Can I hug you?

351
01:01:58.810 --> 01:02:00.144
Come here.

352
01:02:01.713 --> 01:02:03.314
Oh, God.

353
01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:06.919
Oh, God.

354
01:02:10.089 --> 01:02:12.156
Mmm. Oh, God.

355
01:02:13.891 --> 01:02:16.127
Oh, baby,
we missed you so much.


356
01:02:21.532 --> 01:02:23.501
Mmm...

357
01:02:23.635 --> 01:02:24.937
There you are.

358
01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:30.241
You were
such a beautiful baby.


359
01:02:39.751 --> 01:02:41.285
Get it out.

360
01:02:41.419 --> 01:02:43.821
Get it out. Come on.

361
01:02:43.956 --> 01:02:47.059
There you go.
There you go. There you go.


362
01:02:47.191 --> 01:02:49.360
- Sorry.
- Nothing to apologize for.


363
01:02:51.629 --> 01:02:53.398
Are you okay?

364
01:02:56.467 --> 01:03:00.005
The same fire
that destroyed our family...


365
01:03:01.806 --> 01:03:04.676
it burned up my insides.

366
01:03:09.247 --> 01:03:12.183
Mom and Dad used to have a...

367
01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.990
kitchen, heh...

368
01:03:18.123 --> 01:03:20.125
in the basement of our house,

369
01:03:20.258 --> 01:03:23.162
where we used to cook.

370
01:03:27.099 --> 01:03:29.300
It was for our business.

371
01:03:33.604 --> 01:03:35.074
Are you thirsty?

372
01:03:49.721 --> 01:03:50.956
Tara?

373
01:03:52.824 --> 01:03:54.193
I'm dying.

374
01:03:54.325 --> 01:03:55.426
What?

375
01:03:56.929 --> 01:04:00.132
The smoke from the chemicals...

376
01:04:00.264 --> 01:04:03.936
poisoned my blood
and badly damaged my heart.


377
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:06.905
I don't think
I have much time left.


378
01:04:07.039 --> 01:04:08.873
Is there anything you can do?

379
01:04:18.483 --> 01:04:21.954
I heard you left flowers for me
at our old house.


380
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:26.724
Is that true?

381
01:04:29.727 --> 01:04:31.429
Oh.

382
01:04:32.998 --> 01:04:34.099
Weren't you wishing

383
01:04:34.233 --> 01:04:39.138
your mama
was healthy and alive?


384
01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:40.505
Yes.

385
01:04:54.086 --> 01:04:55.954
I need a new heart, baby.

386
01:04:57.055 --> 01:04:59.258
But not just any heart.

387
01:04:59.390 --> 01:05:02.794
Doctor said
it has to be a, uh...


388
01:05:02.928 --> 01:05:04.862
It must be a...

389
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:08.133
compatible donor.

390
01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.472
Like a direct relative.

391
01:05:17.109 --> 01:05:19.978
You hold the gift
that can save your mama's life.


392
01:05:24.283 --> 01:05:27.119
And, baby, I need that gift.

393
01:05:46.138 --> 01:05:49.208
We'll finally
be together as one.


394
01:05:51.143 --> 01:05:56.014
You'll live on in me.

395
01:06:24.977 --> 01:06:25.877
Go home.

396
01:08:19.391 --> 01:08:21.426
Go away.

397
01:08:21.559 --> 01:08:23.627
I said, go.

398
01:08:31.802 --> 01:08:32.870
Stay.

399
01:08:36.008 --> 01:08:37.309
Stay.

400
01:09:09.341 --> 01:09:10.775
Go home.

401
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:20.885
Go home.

402
01:10:02.127 --> 01:10:03.261
I hope you understand

403
01:10:03.395 --> 01:10:05.596
the high risks
of this procedure.


404
01:10:07.065 --> 01:10:08.599
I think I pay you enough.

405
01:10:08.732 --> 01:10:10.634
Shut up and do your job.

406
01:10:12.104 --> 01:10:13.838
Why is she still alive?

407
01:10:15.273 --> 01:10:17.608
If she's dead, so is her heart.

408
01:10:19.077 --> 01:10:20.946
And I can't keep it fresh
long enough


409
01:10:21.079 --> 01:10:24.216
without the proper equipment.

410
01:10:24.349 --> 01:10:27.285
I have to cut it out of her
while she's still breathing.


411
01:10:29.387 --> 01:10:31.056
Hey.

412
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:32.656
Hey, hey, hey.

413
01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:34.593
Hey, hey.

414
01:10:37.862 --> 01:10:39.264
<i>Thank you.</i>

415
01:10:59.683 --> 01:11:01.685
What's wrong with you, man?

416
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:05.190
What they're doing
in there is wrong.


417
01:11:07.025 --> 01:11:08.460
She's our cook.

418
01:11:09.928 --> 01:11:12.898
If she dies,
there's no product.


419
01:11:13.031 --> 01:11:15.367
If there's no product,
there's no us.


420
01:11:17.936 --> 01:11:19.037
<i>¿Comprende?</i>

421
01:11:21.339 --> 01:11:23.108
Still fucking wrong.

422
01:11:31.249 --> 01:11:32.284
Hey.

423
01:11:33.784 --> 01:11:36.054
- You ready?
- Mm-hm.


424
01:11:38.789 --> 01:11:40.025
Let's go.

425
01:12:04.015 --> 01:12:05.217
What the fuck?

426
01:12:11.089 --> 01:12:12.723
Go check it out.

427
01:12:24.402 --> 01:12:25.503
Hm.

428
01:13:30.101 --> 01:13:31.970
You killed my brother!

429
01:13:33.438 --> 01:13:35.407
You blind freak!

430
01:13:57.762 --> 01:14:01.666
I'm gonna carve your fucking
head open like a pumpkin, man.


431
01:14:57.888 --> 01:14:59.991
This is for Shadow.

432
01:15:01.659 --> 01:15:03.061
Oh, fuck.

433
01:15:03.194 --> 01:15:04.429
No!

434
01:15:11.269 --> 01:15:12.704
It's him.

435
01:15:17.742 --> 01:15:20.211
How the hell did he find...?

436
01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:40.865
Disloyal fucking animal.

437
01:15:40.999 --> 01:15:42.902
Is everything okay?

438
01:15:44.602 --> 01:15:46.871
Yeah, everything's okay.

439
01:15:47.005 --> 01:15:49.941
- Everything's okay, I promise.
- Baby, should I be worried?


440
01:15:50.074 --> 01:15:51.709
No, no. Not at all.

441
01:15:51.843 --> 01:15:53.211
I got you. I got you.

442
01:15:53.344 --> 01:15:55.880
I can't work without power.

443
01:15:56.014 --> 01:15:57.081
Uh...

444
01:15:58.049 --> 01:16:00.585
Change of plans, then.

445
01:16:00.718 --> 01:16:02.587
Pack your things.
Bring the girl.


446
01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.955
Raul.

447
01:16:05.623 --> 01:16:07.158
Bring the men.
Kill the blind man.


448
01:16:07.292 --> 01:16:10.962
- How many of us?
- All of you!


449
01:16:13.899 --> 01:16:14.999
Let's go.

450
01:17:48.159 --> 01:17:49.861
They're gonna kill her.

451
01:17:54.432 --> 01:17:56.067
And that's not cool with me.

452
01:17:59.871 --> 01:18:01.105
They're leaving now.

453
01:18:01.239 --> 01:18:02.407
The ladder behind you

454
01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:04.075
leads directly to them.

455
01:18:04.208 --> 01:18:05.810
You'd better hurry.

456
01:18:19.824 --> 01:18:21.292
Go left.

457
01:18:22.427 --> 01:18:23.695
That way.

458
01:18:27.066 --> 01:18:28.600
He'll kill you all.

459
01:18:38.343 --> 01:18:39.310
Fuck it. I'm out.

460
01:18:39.444 --> 01:18:41.713
Hey, hey! Hey!

461
01:19:06.905 --> 01:19:08.907
Good morning, motherfucker.

462
01:19:13.244 --> 01:19:15.981
- Baby.
- Shh, shh. It's okay.


463
01:19:16.115 --> 01:19:18.282
Stop it.

464
01:19:51.016 --> 01:19:52.250
Baby?

465
01:19:53.818 --> 01:19:54.886
Hello?

466
01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:56.654
I can't see you.

467
01:20:06.065 --> 01:20:07.331
Baby?

468
01:20:39.998 --> 01:20:42.034
I'm over here! 
Where are you?

469
01:20:43.334 --> 01:20:44.669
Baby?

470
01:21:08.426 --> 01:21:10.428
I got you, motherfucker.

471
01:21:21.806 --> 01:21:23.108
No.

472
01:21:23.242 --> 01:21:26.577
No! No!

473
01:21:34.652 --> 01:21:35.520
No.

474
01:21:37.222 --> 01:21:39.024
No!

475
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:32.476
Phoenix!

476
01:23:05.877 --> 01:23:07.645
Now...

477
01:23:07.778 --> 01:23:09.680
you're gonna see

478
01:23:09.814 --> 01:23:11.682
what I see.

479
01:24:01.799 --> 01:24:03.302
Phoenix?

480
01:24:13.878 --> 01:24:15.513
Stop.

481
01:24:15.646 --> 01:24:17.282
Oh, stop!

482
01:24:20.385 --> 01:24:21.752
You...

483
01:24:24.089 --> 01:24:26.291
You mustn't come near me.

484
01:24:32.397 --> 01:24:36.335
Everything he said...

485
01:24:39.271 --> 01:24:40.671
is true.

486
01:24:47.379 --> 01:24:49.680
I am no father.

487
01:24:54.453 --> 01:24:56.754
I have killed.

488
01:25:02.394 --> 01:25:03.494
I...

489
01:25:04.495 --> 01:25:06.098
have raped.

490
01:25:07.232 --> 01:25:08.433
I...

491
01:25:11.802 --> 01:25:13.305
am nothing.

492
01:25:19.011 --> 01:25:20.278
Nothing...

493
01:25:22.314 --> 01:25:23.982
but a monster.

494
01:25:30.155 --> 01:25:31.822
And you...

495
01:25:31.957 --> 01:25:34.026
cannot be around me.

496
01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:36.861
Ever.

497
01:25:39.164 --> 01:25:40.065
So go.

498
01:25:43.667 --> 01:25:45.070
Now. Go.

499
01:25:46.405 --> 01:25:47.605
Go!

500
01:26:19.570 --> 01:26:21.705
Oh, God.

501
01:27:11.456 --> 01:27:12.424
Tara?

502
01:27:36.581 --> 01:27:38.283
No.

503
01:27:40.118 --> 01:27:42.720
No. No.

504
01:27:47.159 --> 01:27:48.059
Please.

505
01:27:53.431 --> 01:27:55.167
No, no, no.

506
01:27:56.867 --> 01:27:58.236
Let me help you.

507
01:28:00.105 --> 01:28:01.672
I can save you.

508
01:28:07.445 --> 01:28:09.381
You already have.

509
01:29:54.486 --> 01:29:55.920
Hey.

510
01:29:57.622 --> 01:29:58.657
Hey.

511
01:30:00.058 --> 01:30:01.926
Think there's room for one more?

512
01:30:03.495 --> 01:30:04.529
I'm sure there is.

513
01:30:06.631 --> 01:30:07.999
