00:01:22.952 --> 00:01:29.193
"While he was still speaking,
Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived.


2
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.930
With him was a large crowd
with swords


3
00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:36.800
and clubs from the chief priests
and the elders of the people.


4
00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:41.672
Now the betrayer
had given them a sign saying,


5
00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:45.676
'The one I kiss is the man,
arrest him.'


6
00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:51.815
At once he came up to Jesus
and said, 'Greetings, Rabbi,


7
00:01:51.848 --> 00:01:53.451
and kissed him.'

8
00:01:54.517 --> 00:01:59.957
Jesus said to him, 'Friend,
do what you are here to do.'


9
00:02:01.624 --> 00:02:05.662
Then they came and laid hands
on Jesus and arrested him.


10
00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:09.867
Suddenly, one of those with
Jesus put his hands on his sword,


11
00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.937
drew it and struck the slave of the
high priest cutting off his ear.


12
00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:19.810
Then Jesus said to him,
'Put your sword back into its place,


13
00:02:19.842 --> 00:02:23.548
for all who live by the sword
shall die by the sword.


14
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:27.385
Do you think that
I cannot call on my Father,


15
00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:31.588
and he will at once send me more
than twelve legions of angels?


16
00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:35.993
But how then would
the Scriptures be fulfilled


17
00:02:36.025 --> 00:02:40.430
which say it must happen
in this way?'"


18
00:02:51.407 --> 00:02:56.513
Throughout your life, people
will come to persecute you.


19
00:02:58.082 --> 00:03:01.018
They will tell you
that you're doing evil,


20
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.487
that your actions
are causing harm


21
00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.659
and that everything
you believe is falsehood.


22
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:12.497
All this happened to Jesus.

23
00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.736
And when they came to persecute Jesus,
he knew it was his Father's will.


24
00:03:21.738 --> 00:03:26.643
He knew that it was going
to be okay in the end,


25
00:03:28.445 --> 00:03:32.049
and that this trial
was temporary.


26
00:03:33.883 --> 00:03:37.554
And he knew that to fight
against his attackers


27
00:03:37.588 --> 00:03:40.358
would be to go against
God's plan.


28
00:03:42.493 --> 00:03:45.829
If you fight hate with hate,

29
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.767
who really wins in the end?

30
00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:55.772
If you don't love your enemies,

31
00:03:55.805 --> 00:03:58.809
can you really call yourself
a Christian?


32
00:04:01.945 --> 00:04:05.916
If you don't put away your sword

33
00:04:05.948 --> 00:04:08.719
when they come to crucify you,

34
00:04:09.752 --> 00:04:14.124
how can you still stand
among the angels?


35
00:05:24.494 --> 00:05:25.562
Hmm.

36
00:05:26.563 --> 00:05:28.899
Think you can add to it?

37
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:32.203
It's already 600 words
on a high school baseball team.


38
00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.905
The boy hit a grand slam.

39
00:05:34.938 --> 00:05:38.742
And they still lost.
Besides, he gives shit quotes.


40
00:05:38.775 --> 00:05:41.446
Yeah, he's not
particularly loquacious.


41
00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:44.982
You really want me to add to it?

42
00:05:45.015 --> 00:05:48.786
- Na, I'll make it work.
- It already works.


43
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.922
- Hey, Dani.
- Yeah.


44
00:05:52.955 --> 00:05:56.193
That story about the
new home church, can I have it?


45
00:05:57.895 --> 00:05:59.930
I was gonna give that to Collin.

46
00:05:59.963 --> 00:06:02.566
Why the fuck would you give it to Collin?
He can't write for shit.


47
00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:04.969
Well, I thought it
would be a good learning tool.


48
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:06.936
Baseball is a good
learning tool.


49
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.172
Why, you don't want to write
about baseball anymore?


50
00:06:09.205 --> 00:06:11.708
I want an actual story,

51
00:06:11.742 --> 00:06:16.746
and this feels like the first one
this town has had in a long time.


52
00:06:22.018 --> 00:06:23.920
All right,
if you feel that strongly...


53
00:06:23.953 --> 00:06:26.924
- Perfect, thank you.
- Okay. See ya.


54
00:07:25.782 --> 00:07:28.886
- Aren't you coming in?
- Probably shouldn't.


55
00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:32.156
- Sorry.
- I get it. You're a gentleman.


56
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:33.290
Hmm.

57
00:07:40.097 --> 00:07:44.135
- Good night, Jessica.
- Good night, Thomas.


58
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:34.884
Emeth. It's Greek for truth.

59
00:08:34.917 --> 00:08:37.388
- Michael Hallback?
- I am.


60
00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:39.390
And you must be Jessica Cutler.

61
00:08:41.191 --> 00:08:43.127
Please, come in.

62
00:08:48.031 --> 00:08:50.701
Ah, there's the little bugger.

63
00:08:50.734 --> 00:08:55.773
I'm so sorry, uh, new house, can't seem to
find anything, we're not done unpacking yet.


64
00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:58.742
I've seen all this. Riveting.

65
00:08:58.774 --> 00:09:00.310
Whenever you are ready.

66
00:09:07.417 --> 00:09:08.853
I'm ready.

67
00:09:10.119 --> 00:09:12.188
So,

68
00:09:12.221 --> 00:09:16.960
10 to 12 million people regularly
attend home churches in America.


69
00:09:16.993 --> 00:09:18.362
What do you think accounts
for that?


70
00:09:20.263 --> 00:09:22.465
Well, I think that there's a lot
of people that attend church


71
00:09:22.499 --> 00:09:27.238
because they can remain unnoticed,
they blend in with the big crowds.


72
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:32.475
But that's not how God intends
His relationship with us to be.


73
00:09:32.508 --> 00:09:34.945
You see, going to church
is a very social activity


74
00:09:34.978 --> 00:09:38.816
and your bond with your fellow
believers is incredibly important.


75
00:09:38.849 --> 00:09:43.287
And here at Emeth,
it's our goal to foster


76
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.056
that relationship between
God and His followers,


77
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:49.826
and to help them grow
in their walk with Christ.


78
00:09:49.859 --> 00:09:51.895
You see there's strength
in numbers.


79
00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:58.802
Speaking of numbers, this very small
town already has a Catholic church,


80
00:09:58.835 --> 00:10:01.004
a Methodist church,
a Baptist church


81
00:10:01.037 --> 00:10:04.273
and even a non-denominational church
that meets at the Petersons house


82
00:10:04.306 --> 00:10:08.778
and gets out just in time for everyone
to make it to the farmers' market.


83
00:10:08.811 --> 00:10:13.750
Everyone here is pretty set in their ways and
anything new doesn't tend to last very long.


84
00:10:14.817 --> 00:10:16.953
What makes Emeth so special?

85
00:10:19.221 --> 00:10:23.960
Father used to tell us a story
about an old western town.


86
00:10:23.994 --> 00:10:26.897
It's hot there,
it's hotter even than here,


87
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:31.502
and everybody was always looking for
different ways to quench their thirst.


88
00:10:31.534 --> 00:10:34.137
They tried tonics and powders
and what have you not,


89
00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:38.441
but nothing ever left them
completely satisfied.


90
00:10:38.475 --> 00:10:40.377
And then one day
a man came along


91
00:10:40.409 --> 00:10:45.215
and he built them a well.
Water, real thing.


92
00:10:46.316 --> 00:10:50.287
See, Miss Cutler, when... when when you give
people what they've always been wanting,


93
00:10:51.555 --> 00:10:54.058
they'll never need
anything else.


94
00:10:56.225 --> 00:11:00.330
So you've come to our little
western town to bring us Emeth?


95
00:11:00.363 --> 00:11:03.300
- Heh. I mean, if you want to put it that way.
- I don't.


96
00:11:03.332 --> 00:11:06.770
- So your religious organization...
- It's a church.


97
00:11:08.404 --> 00:11:13.976
It's been in the news many times for
its controversial views and practices.


98
00:11:14.009 --> 00:11:15.379
Should we go over
a few of those...


99
00:11:15.412 --> 00:11:17.815
Look, I know
where you're going with that


100
00:11:17.848 --> 00:11:20.851
and those are very extreme cases and
Emeth has dealt with them accordingly.


101
00:11:20.883 --> 00:11:23.186
- Heh. But you haven't...
- Next question.


102
00:11:26.856 --> 00:11:30.226
How does it feel having a woman
asking questions in your church?


103
00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:32.495
Excuse me?

104
00:11:32.528 --> 00:11:34.530
Well, because I know women are supposed
to remain silent during services,


105
00:11:34.563 --> 00:11:37.166
that's in the Bible, right?

106
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.936
Yes, those are God's words.

107
00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.272
"God's words."

108
00:11:42.305 --> 00:11:47.044
Is that how you justify the stoning of a
divorced woman in one of your Ohio outlets?


109
00:11:47.076 --> 00:11:49.111
I don't have to justify
anything to you.


110
00:11:49.144 --> 00:11:50.847
Let's see...

111
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.549
Oh, let's not forget Emeth's
notorious reputation


112
00:11:53.582 --> 00:11:56.252
for mercilessly harassing
gay people.


113
00:11:56.286 --> 00:12:01.191
What passage did you pull from exactly when
you decided to burn that gay couple's house?


114
00:12:01.224 --> 00:12:05.528
Those sinners
got what they deserved.


115
00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:10.533
Adulterers and sodomites
have no place in God's house.


116
00:12:12.569 --> 00:12:14.538
God hates
all forms of wickedness,


117
00:12:14.571 --> 00:12:18.576
especially those who think
they're above His chosen leaders.


118
00:12:20.643 --> 00:12:21.946
Okay.

119
00:13:07.657 --> 00:13:13.030
Fine, leave. You'll be back.
You always come back.


120
00:13:29.311 --> 00:13:31.648
Did you only bring one of these?

121
00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:35.018
- What more do you want from me, heh?
- Fuck.


122
00:13:35.051 --> 00:13:37.554
I'm gonna need like four more
if I'm gonna get through this.


123
00:13:37.586 --> 00:13:39.989
Okay, well, you asked for it.

124
00:13:40.023 --> 00:13:42.124
Well,
I didn't think she'd make me go back.


125
00:13:42.157 --> 00:13:44.327
You really thought Dani was just
gonna let you write an article


126
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.462
shitting all over
the new church?


127
00:13:47.397 --> 00:13:48.265
You wanna come with me?

128
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.103
No, I have to go to work and
besides, it won't be that bad.


129
00:13:53.135 --> 00:13:55.571
I mean,
how bad could it be?


130
00:13:55.605 --> 00:13:59.042
And, hey,
maybe Thomas will be there.


131
00:13:59.075 --> 00:14:02.145
- Uh, yeah, I highly doubt that.
- Oh, why not?


132
00:14:02.177 --> 00:14:03.679
Have you not talked to him?

133
00:14:03.712 --> 00:14:05.648
Well, no,
we didn't exchange numbers.


134
00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:08.685
Besides,
he's probably long gone.


135
00:14:08.718 --> 00:14:11.088
Well, whatever.

136
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.191
I can hook you up with one of Sunset
Acres' most eligible bachelors.


137
00:14:14.224 --> 00:14:18.028
I can think of at least two
who've only groped me like once.


138
00:14:18.061 --> 00:14:20.596
Okay, I get it.
My job's not that bad.


139
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:25.335
Yeah, heh. Well, if you change your mind, you
can always come work for me as a nurse's aide.


140
00:14:25.368 --> 00:14:28.071
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- Oh, come on.


141
00:14:28.104 --> 00:14:30.206
Changing bedpans
and opening Jell-Os all day


142
00:14:30.239 --> 00:14:32.408
doesn't sound like
fulfilling career alternative.


143
00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:36.580
- You need more of this.
- Yes, give it to me.


144
00:14:36.613 --> 00:14:38.582
Oh, it's all I wanted.

145
00:14:58.268 --> 00:14:59.636
Would you like some water?

146
00:14:59.668 --> 00:15:02.038
What,
is the Kool-Aid not ready yet?


147
00:15:03.572 --> 00:15:05.742
Yeah, sorry. Thank you.

148
00:15:17.253 --> 00:15:20.523
Uh, do you have a bathroom?

149
00:15:40.143 --> 00:15:41.612
Hey.

150
00:15:45.414 --> 00:15:46.482
Thomas.

151
00:15:46.515 --> 00:15:48.584
Sorry, you walked in on that.

152
00:15:50.186 --> 00:15:51.622
So what's up?

153
00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.359
So is this why you couldn't
come in the other night?


154
00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:58.395
No, no,
Georgine is not a thing.


155
00:15:58.427 --> 00:16:00.230
No, no, I mean this.

156
00:16:00.263 --> 00:16:02.099
When was I
supposed to bring that up,


157
00:16:02.132 --> 00:16:04.801
before or after you shat
on religion?


158
00:16:04.834 --> 00:16:06.869
Okay, well, you also said you
weren't gonna be in town long.


159
00:16:06.903 --> 00:16:08.404
Yeah, that part's true.

160
00:16:08.437 --> 00:16:10.806
I'm moving to the next town as soon
as we're established here, all right.


161
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.475
My brother's gonna
take over the church here.


162
00:16:12.508 --> 00:16:13.810
I'm just here to help get
the ball rolling.


163
00:16:13.843 --> 00:16:15.779
Right. Okay.

164
00:16:15.811 --> 00:16:18.114
You're not gonna tell anyone,
right?


165
00:16:19.548 --> 00:16:21.383
No, I'm not gonna tell on you.

166
00:16:21.417 --> 00:16:23.519
From what I could see,
it was all consensual,


167
00:16:23.552 --> 00:16:26.155
which is kind of a rarity
for you guys, so...


168
00:16:26.188 --> 00:16:30.693
Yeah, and it's been at the center
of some pretty fucked up shit.


169
00:16:30.726 --> 00:16:33.562
Okay.
So, why are you a part of it?


170
00:16:33.595 --> 00:16:35.698
Pays really well.

171
00:16:35.731 --> 00:16:37.399
Come on,
I know you're not that shallow.


172
00:16:37.432 --> 00:16:39.668
It's the only thing I've...
I've known, all right,


173
00:16:39.701 --> 00:16:42.404
plus it gives me a platform
that I wouldn't have otherwise.


174
00:16:42.437 --> 00:16:47.677
So I try to use that platform to do
as much good in the world as I can.


175
00:16:49.512 --> 00:16:52.382
From everything I know about Emeth,
I don't see how that's possible.


176
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.119
You have to keep an open mind.

177
00:16:58.855 --> 00:17:00.789
You know,
some people fuck in beds.


178
00:17:00.822 --> 00:17:02.524
You know I'd heard that.

179
00:17:02.557 --> 00:17:05.862
Problem is the bathroom is the only room in
the house that doesn't have a camera in it.


180
00:17:05.894 --> 00:17:07.696
- What?
- Yeah.


181
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.233
Father put cameras in all
the rooms except the bathrooms.


182
00:17:11.267 --> 00:17:13.335
He says it's to keep an eye
on his congregation,


183
00:17:13.368 --> 00:17:16.672
but really I think it's just
to keep the leadership in line


184
00:17:16.706 --> 00:17:20.644
from all those non-consensual
acts you mentioned,


185
00:17:20.676 --> 00:17:23.512
which is sad really, you know.

186
00:17:23.546 --> 00:17:25.749
People do whatever
they want when God's watching,


187
00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:28.851
but as soon as they figure out
others are watching,


188
00:17:28.884 --> 00:17:31.188
they change their behavior
entirely.


189
00:17:32.521 --> 00:17:34.790
This is all off the record,
by the way.


190
00:17:34.824 --> 00:17:38.827
Hmm. Shame. Would have made
a fascinating angle.


191
00:17:48.304 --> 00:17:50.806
Welcome.
Welcome to all of you.


192
00:17:52.508 --> 00:17:56.579
I would now like to introduce our
founder and our shepherd of Emeth.


193
00:17:56.613 --> 00:17:58.815
And he can't be here for long

194
00:17:58.847 --> 00:18:01.750
because he has many other places to go
to help spread the ministry of Emeth.


195
00:18:01.784 --> 00:18:05.489
But we have him here today,
which is the greatest blessing of all.


196
00:18:06.588 --> 00:18:07.691
Father...

197
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.469
Welcome.

198
00:18:20.702 --> 00:18:22.338
Welcome all of you.

199
00:18:23.672 --> 00:18:27.678
God has brought
all of you here...


200
00:18:30.412 --> 00:18:35.719
and God wants
all of you to be here.


201
00:18:35.751 --> 00:18:40.823
And I can't wait to see
what he has in store for you,


202
00:18:41.923 --> 00:18:43.393
here at Emeth.

203
00:18:46.863 --> 00:18:48.599
It won't be easy.

204
00:18:50.767 --> 00:18:54.270
God never promised
that life would be easy,


205
00:18:55.305 --> 00:18:58.608
but it is ultimately

206
00:18:58.641 --> 00:19:01.644
the only way to happiness,

207
00:19:02.944 --> 00:19:05.514
to gaining His favor

208
00:19:06.883 --> 00:19:09.486
and eternal life with Him.

209
00:19:18.795 --> 00:19:22.865
None of you
deserve to be here


210
00:19:25.567 --> 00:19:26.670
for you...

211
00:19:26.702 --> 00:19:31.008
We, are all sinners.

212
00:19:32.874 --> 00:19:36.813
But there is hope,

213
00:19:38.514 --> 00:19:41.084
hope eternal

214
00:19:41.116 --> 00:19:45.422
for even the wickedest
of sinners.


215
00:19:45.454 --> 00:19:49.491
Together through fellowship

216
00:19:49.525 --> 00:19:51.295
and accountability,

217
00:19:52.461 --> 00:19:54.530
we can ensure

218
00:19:54.564 --> 00:19:59.335
that we reach paradise together

219
00:19:59.368 --> 00:20:03.306
and inspire others to join us.

220
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:06.676
Hmm.

221
00:20:11.713 --> 00:20:12.881
We're lucky.

222
00:20:14.717 --> 00:20:20.690
We have a book
that tells us exactly


223
00:20:20.722 --> 00:20:24.994
what we need to do
in order to please Him.


224
00:20:26.028 --> 00:20:28.030
Simple rules,

225
00:20:28.064 --> 00:20:31.935
but rules that the world calls

226
00:20:31.968 --> 00:20:34.671
ludicrous fairytales.

227
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.344
Politically incorrect,

228
00:20:42.878 --> 00:20:45.013
outdated.

229
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.019
I assure you,

230
00:20:51.086 --> 00:20:56.393
there is nothing
outdated about God.


231
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.498
He is alive and well.

232
00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:05.134
And He is in this place.

233
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:10.707
He is in this town.

234
00:21:13.709 --> 00:21:18.849
Like any father,
He demands obedience.


235
00:21:21.017 --> 00:21:25.889
He demands that marriage
be kept sacred,


236
00:21:27.589 --> 00:21:31.961
that we put nothing else
before Him,


237
00:21:32.995 --> 00:21:38.735
that our bodies
be kept His temple.


238
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.739
Now in this town,

239
00:21:46.541 --> 00:21:48.978
there is divorce,

240
00:21:50.179 --> 00:21:55.986
there are people
who don't put God first.


241
00:21:57.553 --> 00:22:01.791
There is extramarital sex,

242
00:22:01.824 --> 00:22:03.759
homosexuality,

243
00:22:03.793 --> 00:22:07.497
and children born
out of wedlock.


244
00:22:09.699 --> 00:22:13.603
All of these things
are an abomination to God


245
00:22:13.635 --> 00:22:16.638
and those that do these things,
He abhors them


246
00:22:16.672 --> 00:22:21.143
and He has stricken their name
from the book of life.


247
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.452
But...

248
00:22:31.887 --> 00:22:37.759
there is a way
to get our name


249
00:22:37.793 --> 00:22:40.931
back in that book.

250
00:22:45.535 --> 00:22:49.906
And that is what
we're here to do.


251
00:23:05.121 --> 00:23:09.993
<i>♪ Rejoice the lord is king ♪</i>

252
00:23:10.026 --> 00:23:11.894
Fuck you.

253
00:23:11.928 --> 00:23:14.063
You talked about doing good
with that.


254
00:23:14.095 --> 00:23:16.098
What good could possibly
come from that?


255
00:23:16.132 --> 00:23:18.167
- It's disgusting.
- I know.


256
00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.537
I know. All right.
But that's not me.


257
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:23.872
Bullshit.

258
00:23:23.905 --> 00:23:27.242
You're part of it, you're part of the
whole fucking thing, guilty by association.


259
00:23:27.276 --> 00:23:28.612
Look you...

260
00:23:30.313 --> 00:23:34.182
You learn to justify stupid opinions like
that or at least you learn to ignore them.


261
00:23:34.216 --> 00:23:37.620
It's hard to leave something
I've known my entire life.


262
00:23:40.221 --> 00:23:42.625
I don't blame you for hating
the things Father said in there.


263
00:23:47.128 --> 00:23:48.797
Can I see you again?

264
00:23:58.874 --> 00:24:00.309
How about now?

265
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.934
So you're afraid to go back
and face the wrath of Father?


266
00:24:25.968 --> 00:24:29.773
No. Just enjoying being here
with you.


267
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.312
The strange thing is though I'll still
apologize profusely when I get back.


268
00:24:38.279 --> 00:24:41.350
Do you really feel like
you're doing something wrong?


269
00:24:41.383 --> 00:24:43.053
Logically no.

270
00:24:44.019 --> 00:24:46.056
But like guilt just comes
with the territory.


271
00:24:48.024 --> 00:24:51.761
Every little thing I do, it's
this feeling that I can't shake,


272
00:24:52.795 --> 00:24:55.131
which sucks
'cause sex is awesome.


273
00:24:57.767 --> 00:24:59.835
Yeah, how do you reconcile that?

274
00:25:02.805 --> 00:25:03.840
I can't.

275
00:25:09.077 --> 00:25:12.147
But if there is a God,

276
00:25:12.181 --> 00:25:15.351
He's a lot more loving and
open-minded than Emeth preaches.


277
00:25:15.383 --> 00:25:20.021
I mean, there's got to be more than
one way to live your life, right?


278
00:25:24.093 --> 00:25:29.231
I mean,
why should someone perish


279
00:25:29.265 --> 00:25:32.669
just because they lived a life
different from everyone else.


280
00:25:34.069 --> 00:25:37.739
I wish I could be more like you.
More definitive.


281
00:25:37.772 --> 00:25:41.010
That I could just write it all
off without a second thought.


282
00:25:42.077 --> 00:25:46.383
You know, I used to buy into the
whole thing too when I was young.


283
00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:52.020
But when I was in third grade,
this boy in my church,


284
00:25:52.054 --> 00:25:53.989
he was just a few years older
than me,


285
00:25:54.923 --> 00:25:57.926
said that the priest
had touched him, yeah.


286
00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.162
And then a bunch of other kids,
boys and girls,


287
00:26:00.195 --> 00:26:03.298
came out and said that he had
done the same thing to them.


288
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.003
You know what the church did?

289
00:26:07.036 --> 00:26:12.174
They moved him to another
church, heh, like an hour away.


290
00:26:15.877 --> 00:26:19.281
One of the boys killed himself
a few years later


291
00:26:19.315 --> 00:26:23.420
and still nothing happened
to that priest.


292
00:26:27.123 --> 00:26:29.758
And this isn't
a unique situation.


293
00:26:29.791 --> 00:26:33.062
That wasn't one bad guy
doing a bad thing.


294
00:26:34.162 --> 00:26:35.765
And the church was complicit.

295
00:26:35.797 --> 00:26:41.203
And so, as part of the church,
I was complicit.


296
00:26:41.237 --> 00:26:44.474
When I told my parents that,
they kicked me out.


297
00:26:47.543 --> 00:26:50.146
I've been making my own way
ever since.


298
00:26:51.247 --> 00:26:53.283
That's why I like
coming out here.


299
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.852
Why is that?

300
00:26:55.884 --> 00:26:58.820
'Cause life is chaos,

301
00:26:58.854 --> 00:27:02.458
but you can choose to
just walk out into that water,


302
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:06.796
close your eyes
and see what happens.


303
00:27:10.666 --> 00:27:14.536
There's something freeing
about giving it into the chaos


304
00:27:14.569 --> 00:27:17.506
and coming out on top...

305
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:20.844
if you're lucky.

306
00:27:24.313 --> 00:27:25.882
And if you're not?

307
00:27:26.981 --> 00:27:27.916
Then you're not.

308
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:32.822
-Yeah.

309
00:27:34.256 --> 00:27:36.124
- It made so much sense though.
- Oh, yeah?


310
00:27:36.158 --> 00:27:37.894
- Yeah.
- Maybe to you.


311
00:27:39.862 --> 00:27:41.264
- I didn't mean it like that, heh.
- Oh, okay.


312
00:27:41.297 --> 00:27:43.132
Okay, maybe a little.

313
00:27:43.164 --> 00:27:45.033
Are you sure
I can't give you a ride home?


314
00:27:45.066 --> 00:27:47.804
No, I'm fine.
I prefer walking.


315
00:27:47.836 --> 00:27:50.172
Gives me time to clear my head
and practice my apology.


316
00:27:50.206 --> 00:27:54.076
- Are you gonna go home?
- I have to, eventually.


317
00:27:54.108 --> 00:27:55.944
Hmm, tsk.

318
00:27:55.978 --> 00:27:59.315
Well, do you want to come
in this time?


319
00:28:05.354 --> 00:28:07.056
No cameras in here.

320
00:28:15.564 --> 00:28:18.534
Can I maybe get
you a drink or something?


321
00:29:04.313 --> 00:29:06.482
- Hey.
- Hey.


322
00:29:06.515 --> 00:29:09.919
- You want some breakfast?
- Sure.


323
00:29:13.154 --> 00:29:15.191
So I'm gonna warn you,

324
00:29:15.223 --> 00:29:17.993
there might not be anything
edible in my fridge, like at all.


325
00:29:18.027 --> 00:29:19.895
- Nothing...
- Morning.


326
00:29:22.631 --> 00:29:27.069
Don't you two make
a nice couple? Mighty nice.


327
00:29:27.102 --> 00:29:28.638
What the fuck
are you doing here?


328
00:29:28.671 --> 00:29:31.172
Get out.

329
00:29:31.206 --> 00:29:35.545
Excuse me.
You never changed your locks.


330
00:29:36.945 --> 00:29:38.647
You never even asked
for my keys,


331
00:29:38.681 --> 00:29:42.919
so you must have wanted me to
come back through those doors.


332
00:29:42.951 --> 00:29:45.554
Get the fuck out!

333
00:29:45.586 --> 00:29:46.922
Shh.

334
00:29:49.525 --> 00:29:52.362
Aren't you gonna introduce me
to your new friend?


335
00:29:54.395 --> 00:29:56.464
I knew you'd move on

336
00:29:56.498 --> 00:30:01.270
but I had hoped you would be with
someone who wasn't so beautiful.


337
00:30:05.039 --> 00:30:06.174
It's time for you to go.

338
00:30:07.608 --> 00:30:08.676
That's funny

339
00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:15.050
'cause, uh, I was thinking
the same thing about you.


340
00:30:15.084 --> 00:30:16.419
Boys.

341
00:30:16.451 --> 00:30:18.119
Seth, do not do this please,
I beg you.


342
00:30:18.153 --> 00:30:19.521
- Hey, hey.
- What the... Hey! Hey!


343
00:30:19.555 --> 00:30:22.091
- Thomas! Thomas!
- You son of a bitch!


344
00:30:22.124 --> 00:30:24.527
Fuck you! Fuck you!

345
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:29.731
Stop it.

346
00:30:36.537 --> 00:30:38.606
You know,
I never could figure out


347
00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.345
what I had to do to make you see
that we were perfect for each other.


348
00:30:42.377 --> 00:30:44.679
Why can't you just see that?

349
00:30:49.585 --> 00:30:52.587
Hey, boss,
what do you want us to do with him?


350
00:30:57.092 --> 00:30:59.195
Take him back where he belongs.

351
00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:10.706
Jessica.

352
00:31:13.508 --> 00:31:14.643
Jessica.

353
00:31:30.392 --> 00:31:35.131
So,
you want to tell us where you've been?


354
00:31:37.533 --> 00:31:39.268
Look, we already know.
Just own up to it.


355
00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.236
Hold your tongue.

356
00:31:44.405 --> 00:31:47.309
You spent the night
with another.


357
00:31:48.343 --> 00:31:50.278
You're weak in the eyes of God

358
00:31:50.312 --> 00:31:52.681
and you have soiled your
relationship with your betrothed.


359
00:31:52.713 --> 00:31:55.083
She's not my betrothed.

360
00:31:56.218 --> 00:31:58.021
Never agreed to that.

361
00:32:06.795 --> 00:32:08.663
It's about time somebody around here
started thinking for themselves.


362
00:32:08.697 --> 00:32:11.300
Sit down.

363
00:32:12.534 --> 00:32:16.505
You think you can break God's
rules and just get away with it?


364
00:32:16.537 --> 00:32:18.807
Haven't I taught you
better than that by now?


365
00:32:20.741 --> 00:32:24.312
Yeah, sure.

366
00:32:26.181 --> 00:32:28.651
All right.
Let's talk about God's rules.


367
00:32:32.421 --> 00:32:35.825
That book says we can't
have bacon or shrimp.


368
00:32:35.857 --> 00:32:39.761
You can't trim your beard.
No mixing meat or dairy.


369
00:32:39.795 --> 00:32:43.332
So I guess we're all going to hell for
eating fucking cheeseburgers, right?


370
00:32:43.364 --> 00:32:44.732
No sex.

371
00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:47.370
But you turn a blind eye if it's
the woman you want me to marry.


372
00:32:49.270 --> 00:32:53.142
How exactly do you choose which
of God's rules we follow, Father?


373
00:32:55.243 --> 00:32:58.346
- If only your mother were...
- No.


374
00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.614
No, you don't get to do that.

375
00:32:59.647 --> 00:33:02.484
My mother?
I never knew my mother.


376
00:33:02.518 --> 00:33:04.653
You've never had a wife.

377
00:33:04.685 --> 00:33:06.821
Are the three of us
even related?


378
00:33:06.855 --> 00:33:09.658
Oh, right, I forgot, we're not
allowed to ask about that.


379
00:33:09.691 --> 00:33:12.361
We're not allowed to ask any fucking
questions about anything at all.


380
00:33:14.296 --> 00:33:17.799
So, no, you don't get
to guilt-trip me for shit.


381
00:33:17.833 --> 00:33:21.737
You don't have to stand there like I'm a
sinner when you're nothing but a hypocrite.


382
00:33:24.306 --> 00:33:25.508
Repent.

383
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:30.846
Or what?

384
00:33:34.883 --> 00:33:36.719
That's what I thought.

385
00:33:38.252 --> 00:33:39.621
I'll show myself out.

386
00:33:53.468 --> 00:33:55.171
Here's your water.

387
00:33:55.203 --> 00:33:59.207
I have to go to work but
mom's here if you need anything.


388
00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.310
Oh, and your phone was ringing,
I think you missed a call.


389
00:34:10.351 --> 00:34:11.853
Are you okay?

390
00:34:37.945 --> 00:34:39.548
Exactly where I wanna be.

391
00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:42.585
I love you.

392
00:34:43.684 --> 00:34:45.320
And I love you.

393
00:35:20.755 --> 00:35:22.224
Mama!

394
00:35:23.358 --> 00:35:24.527
You awake?

395
00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:28.998
Mama!

396
00:35:53.655 --> 00:35:54.957
It's okay.

397
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.693
- She's gone.
- I know. I know.


398
00:35:58.994 --> 00:36:00.528
Okay.

399
00:36:00.561 --> 00:36:02.498
- She's gone.
- I know.


400
00:36:16.644 --> 00:36:18.813
This isn't the same room
anymore.


401
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:24.485
I've known this room
my entire life.


402
00:36:26.355 --> 00:36:30.659
I've slept in here,
played games in here.


403
00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:34.330
I even brought some boys in here

404
00:36:34.362 --> 00:36:36.765
because the bed
was so much nicer than mine.


405
00:36:39.867 --> 00:36:42.704
Now everything is gone.

406
00:36:46.007 --> 00:36:47.610
It's just empty.

407
00:36:53.949 --> 00:36:56.351
Whom I gonna take care of now?

408
00:36:57.786 --> 00:37:00.722
Who's gonna take care of me?
I'm not like you.


409
00:37:00.755 --> 00:37:05.560
I'm not self-motivated.
I'm not good at being alone.


410
00:37:05.594 --> 00:37:07.963
You're stronger than you think.

411
00:37:07.996 --> 00:37:10.932
What am I supposed to do now,
just throw myself into my work?


412
00:37:10.965 --> 00:37:12.967
Where's my bright outlook
in that?


413
00:37:21.409 --> 00:37:22.545
You'll figure it out.

414
00:37:23.844 --> 00:37:26.381
I wish you could just tell me
what to do.


415
00:37:26.414 --> 00:37:27.715
The girl with all the answers.

416
00:37:29.117 --> 00:37:32.388
I know.
I wish I could too.


417
00:37:39.126 --> 00:37:41.063
I'm happy it was peaceful.

418
00:37:42.496 --> 00:37:44.966
I'm happy she was asleep
when it happened.


419
00:37:51.139 --> 00:37:53.976
I know it's not gonna
go back to being the same,


420
00:37:56.144 --> 00:37:58.114
but is it ever gonna be
anything?


421
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.052
You'll figure it out.

422
00:38:04.085 --> 00:38:08.157
One day you'll wake up
and it won't hurt as bad,


423
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.659
and it won't be so lonely.

424
00:38:11.693 --> 00:38:13.496
You'll go in that new direction.

425
00:38:53.101 --> 00:38:54.737
Tell me the plan again.

426
00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.210
We'll have a little baby girl

427
00:39:03.577 --> 00:39:08.750
and she will be the most beautiful
thing that you or I have ever seen.


428
00:39:10.117 --> 00:39:13.822
I'll go back as assistant editor
of the paper.


429
00:39:13.855 --> 00:39:17.193
You can stay home with our daughter
while writing your stories.


430
00:39:19.126 --> 00:39:22.498
By the time
our little girl turns six,


431
00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:28.003
we will be in a city too big for
small-minded people to hurt us.


432
00:39:31.572 --> 00:39:35.543
She'll grow up
and be who she wants to be,


433
00:39:36.244 --> 00:39:38.914
believe what she wants
to believe,


434
00:39:39.914 --> 00:39:42.485
and love who she wants to love.

435
00:39:43.818 --> 00:39:48.990
No one will ever tell her that she
is less than or not good enough.


436
00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:56.899
She'll have a life far better
than you or I could ever imagine.


437
00:39:58.699 --> 00:40:02.003
And then you and I will grow old
and wrinkly together,


438
00:40:04.139 --> 00:40:08.143
bound together by a closeness
that no poet could put into words


439
00:40:08.175 --> 00:40:10.612
and no scientist
could ever explain.


440
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.119
- I love you.
- I love you.

Hi, Thomas.
Hi, Jessica.


448
00:41:10.704 --> 00:41:12.641
- Hello.
- Hi.


449
00:41:12.673 --> 00:41:15.376
Jessica, you look incredible.

450
00:41:15.409 --> 00:41:18.746
I've never seen a more beautiful
pregnant person before.


451
00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:19.982
Thank you.

452
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:24.820
I know it's early but,

453
00:41:24.853 --> 00:41:28.724
ah,
we got you a Christmas present.


454
00:41:28.757 --> 00:41:30.758
It's baby blankets.

455
00:41:30.791 --> 00:41:34.395
Uh, Michael actually picked them out.
I just wrapped them.


456
00:41:34.429 --> 00:41:36.932
Thank You, Georgine,
that's very kind of you.


457
00:41:36.965 --> 00:41:39.335
Ah. I hope the child
enjoys them.


458
00:41:40.235 --> 00:41:46.208
And I wanted to let you both know that
Michael and I will be getting married


459
00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.009
the weekend
after Christmas.


460
00:41:49.711 --> 00:41:53.315
Anyway, I would love
if you both could make it out.


461
00:41:53.347 --> 00:41:56.217
It will be at Emeth
starting at 4:30.


462
00:41:56.251 --> 00:42:00.287
And I know Michael would be
really happy to see you there too.


463
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.923
Yeah, we'll...
we'll check our calendar.


464
00:42:02.956 --> 00:42:08.195
Great.
Well, happy holidays, heh!


465
00:42:08.228 --> 00:42:10.364
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye.


466
00:42:20.007 --> 00:42:23.744
- At some point I'm probably gonna have to pee.
- Mm-hm.


467
00:42:23.777 --> 00:42:25.947
Do you think it's safe to go
in there at this time?


468
00:42:27.115 --> 00:42:30.986
Why, did you want the Emeth VIP
bathroom experience?


469
00:42:31.019 --> 00:42:32.888
Yes. Yes, I do.

470
00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.155
We'll find a way to make
that happen.


471
00:42:34.188 --> 00:42:38.393
Is that a promise? Good.

472
00:42:38.425 --> 00:42:39.960
- Hold me to it.
- I will.


473
00:42:39.994 --> 00:42:41.196
- Okay.
- Heh.


474
00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.036
Hi there.

475
00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:53.407
- Hi there.
- She's really pregnant.


476
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.776
- Yes, she is.
- I am.


477
00:42:55.809 --> 00:42:58.246
- When's she due?
- Next month.


478
00:42:58.278 --> 00:43:00.114
You're not wearing
a wedding ring.


479
00:43:00.148 --> 00:43:02.350
That's because
we're not married.


480
00:43:02.382 --> 00:43:06.721
Oh, poor child.

481
00:43:10.291 --> 00:43:11.794
Enjoy the wedding.

482
00:43:17.065 --> 00:43:21.737
I love you, Michael, and
I know that you love me too.


483
00:43:21.769 --> 00:43:26.240
Because of this,
I desire to be your wife, heh.


484
00:43:26.273 --> 00:43:31.846
For 20 years I have prayed that
God would lead me to His choice


485
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:38.019
and I am confident His will
is being fulfilled tonight.


486
00:43:38.052 --> 00:43:42.824
Through the pressures of the present
and the uncertainties of the future,


487
00:43:42.856 --> 00:43:45.460
I promise to be faithful to you.

488
00:43:45.492 --> 00:43:50.965
I will love, serve, and obey you
as long as we both are alive.


489
00:43:50.998 --> 00:43:55.069
Christ told us, "The wife should
submit herself to her own husband


490
00:43:55.103 --> 00:43:58.940
as to the Lord for as Christ
is head of the church,


491
00:43:58.972 --> 00:44:01.008
so is the husband
head of his wife."


492
00:44:02.277 --> 00:44:05.880
Michael,
I submit myself to you.


493
00:44:14.889 --> 00:44:19.961
Georgine, I love you,
and I know that God has ordained our love.


494
00:44:20.929 --> 00:44:25.032
Because of that,
I desire to be your husband.


495
00:44:25.065 --> 00:44:29.436
Together we will be vessels
for His service


496
00:44:29.469 --> 00:44:32.106
in accordance with His plan

497
00:44:32.139 --> 00:44:36.844
so that in all areas of our life,
Christ will have preeminence.


498
00:44:38.345 --> 00:44:40.414
Through the pressures
of the present


499
00:44:40.447 --> 00:44:45.085
and the uncertainty of the future,
I promise to be faithful to you.


500
00:44:45.119 --> 00:44:48.923
I promise to love you,
to guide you


501
00:44:48.956 --> 00:44:54.496
and to protect you as Christ did for
His church as long as we're both alive.


502
00:44:55.896 --> 00:45:00.501
According to Ephesians 5 and
the power enabled through him,


503
00:45:01.501 --> 00:45:06.909
I promise to love you as Christ loved
the church so much that He died for her.


504
00:45:08.041 --> 00:45:13.315
And I will treat you as part of me
because in His sight we will be one.


505
00:45:24.492 --> 00:45:29.097
I now pronounce you
man and wife.


506
00:45:34.068 --> 00:45:39.274
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Hallback.


507
00:45:58.425 --> 00:46:00.161
Hello, ladies.

508
00:46:01.262 --> 00:46:05.267
Wow, look at you.

509
00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.169
Isn't this just beautiful?

510
00:46:08.635 --> 00:46:11.472
A divine miracle.

511
00:46:11.505 --> 00:46:14.609
Oh, isn't this just beautiful?

512
00:46:15.576 --> 00:46:18.246
That's enough.
Jess, you all right?


513
00:46:18.278 --> 00:46:24.018
- Yeah, I'm... I'm... I'm fine.
- Try not to make a scene now, boy.


514
00:46:24.052 --> 00:46:26.954
Not on such
a beautiful occasion.


515
00:46:26.987 --> 00:46:28.989
- You okay?
- I'm fine.


516
00:46:29.023 --> 00:46:31.593
He's a very dedicated
and passionate follower.


517
00:46:31.626 --> 00:46:33.295
Emeth is lucky to have him.

518
00:46:34.429 --> 00:46:35.963
He's an abusive creep.

519
00:46:35.996 --> 00:46:38.599
- He who repents...
- Yeah, save it.


520
00:46:38.632 --> 00:46:40.434
Jess, why don't we go back
to the reception?


521
00:46:40.467 --> 00:46:44.940
Oh, the reception
is for members only,


522
00:46:44.972 --> 00:46:49.076
not for the unwholesome,
not for sinners


523
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:53.081
who shamelessly lure their
adultery in front of others.


524
00:46:55.182 --> 00:46:59.320
You've made your choice.
There's no reason to come back.


525
00:47:09.563 --> 00:47:11.665
I never wanted a wedding.

526
00:47:11.699 --> 00:47:14.668
When I was growing up, all the girls
would talk about their special day


527
00:47:14.702 --> 00:47:17.572
and I just couldn't picture it
for myself.


528
00:47:17.605 --> 00:47:19.974
I dreaded it.

529
00:47:20.007 --> 00:47:23.143
I had nightmares about standing next
to someone I had no connection with.


530
00:47:23.177 --> 00:47:27.215
- And now?
- Now I'm in love.


531
00:47:27.248 --> 00:47:30.452
I don't need rings
or sexist vows.


532
00:47:30.485 --> 00:47:34.122
I'm here.
I'm never going anywhere.


533
00:47:35.722 --> 00:47:39.393
- I love you.
- I love you too.


534
00:47:39.427 --> 00:47:41.496
- Let's get the hell out of here, heh.
- Yes, ma'am.


535
00:48:38.286 --> 00:48:40.655
All right, Jessica,
get your ass out of here.


536
00:48:40.688 --> 00:48:43.124
You said you were leaving
at 3:00 today, it's 3:30.


537
00:48:43.824 --> 00:48:46.160
Shit, okay.

538
00:48:46.193 --> 00:48:49.697
Um, I'm almost done marking Lisa's
story and then I am out of here.


539
00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:50.798
Good.

540
00:48:56.304 --> 00:48:58.740
Dani, oh, my God,
what happened?


541
00:48:58.773 --> 00:49:02.309
Oh, this? What, you don't like
my new beauty marks?


542
00:49:02.342 --> 00:49:05.212
Dani, what happened?

543
00:49:05.246 --> 00:49:08.349
A few of your church friends
paid me a visit last night.


544
00:49:08.382 --> 00:49:10.385
They threw rocks and bricks
through my window.


545
00:49:10.418 --> 00:49:12.287
Oh. God, why?

546
00:49:13.855 --> 00:49:17.257
Do you remember that story that Collin
wrote highlighting the women's clinic


547
00:49:17.291 --> 00:49:19.094
and the services they provide?

548
00:49:19.126 --> 00:49:20.327
Mm-hm.

549
00:49:21.961 --> 00:49:26.601
I added a little bit in there about how
Emeth is protesting them as baby killers,


550
00:49:26.633 --> 00:49:31.472
which is interesting because abortion
isn't even a service they provide.


551
00:49:32.673 --> 00:49:34.542
They didn't like that.

552
00:49:34.574 --> 00:49:37.311
You should report it
to the police.


553
00:49:37.344 --> 00:49:39.346
I did.

554
00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:44.486
They couldn't prove who it was
but it's pretty obvious to me.


555
00:49:45.887 --> 00:49:48.556
They put signs in our yard
the other day.


556
00:49:53.894 --> 00:49:57.664
Apparently, the snide remarks and looks at
the grocery store aren't enough anymore.


557
00:49:57.697 --> 00:50:00.167
And now they are dragging
Arcadia into it.


558
00:50:00.201 --> 00:50:01.536
Oh.

559
00:50:01.568 --> 00:50:03.637
What am I supposed to do,
just ignore it?


560
00:50:04.605 --> 00:50:07.809
How do you fight back
against something like that?


561
00:50:07.842 --> 00:50:13.213
You'll be okay.
You're almost away from them for good.


562
00:50:13.246 --> 00:50:15.349
But you're not.

563
00:50:15.382 --> 00:50:18.185
Yeah, I'd like to really
see them try and fuck with me.


564
00:50:20.554 --> 00:50:22.923
So you got a good
evening planned?


565
00:50:22.956 --> 00:50:25.626
Yeah, Katie's coming over.

566
00:50:25.659 --> 00:50:28.595
I haven't seen her in forever and we're gonna
start planning Arcadia's birthday party.


567
00:50:28.628 --> 00:50:30.197
Oh, sounds fun.

568
00:50:30.231 --> 00:50:31.533
You and Collin
are gonna be there, right?


569
00:50:31.565 --> 00:50:34.301
Wouldn't miss it.
He might, though.


570
00:50:34.335 --> 00:50:36.371
I just... I never know
what's going on with that boy.


571
00:50:40.608 --> 00:50:42.710
- I'll give this to Lisa.
- Thank you.


572
00:50:42.742 --> 00:50:44.445
You're welcome.

573
00:50:55.755 --> 00:50:57.891
How am I gonna run this place
without you?


574
00:50:57.925 --> 00:51:02.864
Hey,
you're gonna kick ass as usual.


575
00:51:03.931 --> 00:51:06.367
- Yeah.
- I'll see you tomorrow.


576
00:51:52.345 --> 00:51:54.949
Hey, it's time for bed, pumpkin.

577
00:51:54.981 --> 00:51:56.550
Can you tell Aunt Katie
good night?


578
00:51:56.583 --> 00:52:00.721
- Good night, Aunt Katie.
- Good night, sweetheart.


579
00:52:00.755 --> 00:52:03.992
Wrap those arms.
Okay, got it.


580
00:52:04.025 --> 00:52:05.693
Okay, let's go.

581
00:52:10.998 --> 00:52:13.400
Oh, no. Uh, what time is it?

582
00:52:13.434 --> 00:52:15.870
Um, I'm so sorry I have to go.

583
00:52:15.902 --> 00:52:19.840
- Uh...
- Okay, bye.


584
00:52:29.550 --> 00:52:30.852
Katie.

585
00:52:33.753 --> 00:52:36.923
Katie. Hey, Katie.

586
00:53:07.454 --> 00:53:10.525
It's his last jab.
Don't get angry. That's what he wants.


587
00:53:10.557 --> 00:53:12.025
They all want you to be upset.

588
00:53:12.059 --> 00:53:16.064
And why shouldn't I be?
It's my fault.


589
00:53:17.565 --> 00:53:19.800
I knew something was off
with Katie.


590
00:53:19.833 --> 00:53:23.503
Ever since her mom died, she's been
drifting further and further away


591
00:53:23.536 --> 00:53:26.774
and I was too busy with you
and Arcadia to be a good friend.


592
00:53:28.809 --> 00:53:31.412
- Fuck.
- It's not your fault.


593
00:53:31.445 --> 00:53:34.882
Her choices aren't your problem.
She's a grown woman.


594
00:53:34.914 --> 00:53:38.519
What matters is that her stupid
decisions don't come back and hurt us.


595
00:53:41.588 --> 00:53:44.358
Yeah, okay.

596
00:53:44.391 --> 00:53:46.493
Mommy?

597
00:53:46.527 --> 00:53:48.496
- You want to take care of that?
- She's calling you, man.


598
00:53:50.563 --> 00:53:52.065
I'll take the next one,
I promise.


599
00:53:52.099 --> 00:53:53.535
Okay.

600
00:53:56.836 --> 00:53:58.873
What is it, baby?

601
00:53:58.905 --> 00:54:04.077
- Do you have a mommy and daddy?
- Yes, but they live far away.


602
00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:07.382
Does daddy have a mommy
and daddy?


603
00:54:07.414 --> 00:54:10.552
- He has a daddy.
- Where is he?


604
00:54:14.621 --> 00:54:17.090
No, absolutely fucking not.

605
00:54:17.123 --> 00:54:19.827
- Just think about it, okay?
- No.


606
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:25.565
We can't project our issues with your family
on to her, she doesn't know any better.


607
00:54:25.599 --> 00:54:28.803
I mean, we knew this would happen
at some point, we talked about it.


608
00:54:28.836 --> 00:54:32.774
She can meet your family here and then
my family at some point down the road.


609
00:54:32.807 --> 00:54:36.411
Okay, and what if she comes back
and she wants to do Jesus shit?


610
00:54:41.048 --> 00:54:45.453
Then we let her do Jesus shit.
We talked about that too.


611
00:54:49.623 --> 00:54:52.793
Of course, this would happen
as soon as we're about to leave.


612
00:54:57.164 --> 00:54:59.534
Maybe it's for the best.

613
00:54:59.566 --> 00:55:01.835
I can watch her
while we wrap her presents.


614
00:55:01.869 --> 00:55:07.441
When we finish setting up for the party,
they meet her now and then we're gone.


615
00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:18.853
- We're gonna be back, you go to bed, okay?
- Okay.


616
00:55:18.885 --> 00:55:21.154
- We'll be back.
- Well, look who it is.


617
00:55:21.188 --> 00:55:24.157
No, not them. This is a major
breach of our trust, Michael...


618
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:26.526
We are leaving, Thomas.
We're leaving.


619
00:55:26.559 --> 00:55:28.528
It's a beautiful little girl
you got there.


620
00:55:28.561 --> 00:55:30.697
We show up 30 minutes late
so you wouldn't pull this shit.


621
00:55:30.731 --> 00:55:33.201
We're sorry. We are very,
very sorry and we are leaving.


622
00:55:33.233 --> 00:55:34.802
Uh-huh,
it doesn't fucking look like it.


623
00:55:36.202 --> 00:55:37.838
Watch your mouth, boy.

624
00:55:37.871 --> 00:55:40.240
- What the hell? I thought we had an agreement.
- Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.


625
00:55:40.273 --> 00:55:42.576
We just lost track of time.

626
00:55:44.211 --> 00:55:49.050
Is that Arcadia? Oh, hello there.
I'm your Aunty Georgine.


627
00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:51.052
Hello.

628
00:55:51.085 --> 00:55:56.490
And look, this is your uncle Michael.
Let's wave at him. Hi.


629
00:55:56.523 --> 00:56:00.760
So do you like teddy bears?
What about puzzles?


630
00:56:00.793 --> 00:56:03.797
Great. Well, we're gonna go right
inside, your grandfather's in there.


631
00:56:03.831 --> 00:56:06.501
He's so excited to meet you.

632
00:56:07.568 --> 00:56:10.171
We'll be back by nine.
She usually passes out around eight.


633
00:56:10.204 --> 00:56:12.474
Okay.
I'll let Georgine know.


634
00:56:49.677 --> 00:56:53.715
- She's quite good with children.
- Yes, she is.


635
00:56:54.981 --> 00:56:56.650
She'll make a good mother.

636
00:57:01.655 --> 00:57:04.859
I do wish
they'd hurry up and conceive.


637
00:57:06.293 --> 00:57:09.197
I'm afraid they're not trying
as often as they should.


638
00:57:15.869 --> 00:57:18.806
All right,
who's ready for dinner?


639
00:57:20.708 --> 00:57:23.344
Guess what we're having for
dessert, Arcadia? Birthday cake.


640
00:57:23.376 --> 00:57:26.179
- Ah! Oh, yeah!
- Yay, heh!


641
00:57:26.213 --> 00:57:30.051
Yes. It's chocolate..

642
00:57:36.757 --> 00:57:39.360
I'll slip out while she's distracted.
We'll be back at nine.


643
00:57:39.393 --> 00:57:41.563
Uh, thank you again.

644
00:57:55.775 --> 00:57:59.312
You know, you'll never learn
unless you practice.


645
00:57:59.345 --> 00:58:02.916
You gotta let me master cutting the
paper before I can move on to wrapping.


646
00:58:04.385 --> 00:58:06.054
Cut some paper then.

647
00:58:09.956 --> 00:58:12.659
I think, it went pretty well
given how it all started.


648
00:58:12.693 --> 00:58:14.028
Yeah, me too.

649
00:58:14.961 --> 00:58:17.197
I think,
Father watches them fuck.


650
00:58:17.231 --> 00:58:19.100
Oh, yeah, for sure.

651
00:58:20.066 --> 00:58:23.371
- Has he always done that?
- I try not to think about it.


652
00:58:24.672 --> 00:58:27.208
- It's fucking gross.
- Yeah.


653
00:58:37.751 --> 00:58:40.888
Did you see the bruises
on Katie's neck?


654
00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.656
No, I didn't notice.

655
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:47.193
He's just as much
a piece of shit as always.


656
00:58:47.226 --> 00:58:49.730
She knew that. I just...
I don't understand.


657
00:58:49.762 --> 00:58:52.900
Jess, there's nothing
you can do for her right now.


658
00:58:53.833 --> 00:58:57.303
You know better than anyone else that
she has to figure things out for herself


659
00:58:57.336 --> 00:58:59.273
and make her own decisions.

660
00:59:07.246 --> 00:59:08.348
All done.

661
00:59:09.416 --> 00:59:12.320
- And you didn't even need me.
- Heh, that's true.


662
00:59:39.378 --> 00:59:42.882
Okay, just, uh, promise me
that we're gonna hire a babysitter soon.


663
00:59:42.916 --> 00:59:46.019
- That is a promise.
- And actually have a date night 'cause...


664
00:59:46.052 --> 00:59:47.755
Amen to that.

665
00:59:49.456 --> 00:59:52.059
- What the hell?
- What's going on?


666
00:59:52.092 --> 00:59:54.795
- I have no idea.
- Oh, my God.


667
00:59:54.827 --> 00:59:55.996
Something is wrong.

668
00:59:56.028 --> 00:59:58.364
Arcadia!

669
00:59:58.398 --> 01:00:01.736
Oh, Thomas. Jessica.

670
01:00:01.769 --> 01:00:04.004
- Georgine, what's going on?
- We can't find her. We can't find her.


671
01:00:04.036 --> 01:00:06.506
- What?
- I'm so sorry.


672
01:00:06.539 --> 01:00:08.842
- We can't find Arcadia.
- Let me find.


673
01:00:08.876 --> 01:00:10.344
- You can't.
- Let me find.


674
01:00:10.376 --> 01:00:11.778
- It's forbidden.
- Watch me.


675
01:00:11.811 --> 01:00:12.345
- Arcadia.
- Arcadia.


676
01:00:12.378 --> 01:00:14.380
No! No!

677
01:02:57.043 --> 01:02:58.945
She's asleep.

678
01:02:58.978 --> 01:03:00.614
- Is she...
- She's great, Katie.


679
01:03:01.615 --> 01:03:03.350
Don't talk to me like that.

680
01:03:03.382 --> 01:03:05.485
- I'm only trying to be...
- What, a friend?


681
01:03:05.519 --> 01:03:07.554
Is that what you think you are?

682
01:03:07.586 --> 01:03:10.690
- Well...
- Don't pretend like you're not here on their orders,


683
01:03:10.724 --> 01:03:13.427
just to see if we've figured out
what really happened.


684
01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:18.398
- Thomas, it was an accident.
- You weren't there.


685
01:03:18.432 --> 01:03:22.369
- You just believe in what they told you.
- You used to believe them too.


686
01:03:22.402 --> 01:03:27.307
You used to believe everything.
Then you left.


687
01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.643
Are you really surprised
by what's happened to you?


688
01:03:29.675 --> 01:03:32.145
The prodigal son
has wandered off the path.


689
01:03:36.749 --> 01:03:38.652
Looks like that hurts.

690
01:03:38.684 --> 01:03:40.621
Good to know Seth is doing well though..

691
01:03:46.258 --> 01:03:48.262
Her name was Arcadia.

692
01:03:51.498 --> 01:03:55.168
Katie,
do you know that name means?


693
01:03:58.338 --> 01:04:04.345
Unspoiled paradise.
And she was.


694
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.951
She really, really was.

695
01:04:15.722 --> 01:04:17.557
And now she's gone.

696
01:04:20.059 --> 01:04:21.328
Why is that?

697
01:04:31.070 --> 01:04:32.239
Why?

698
01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.476
Tell me, Katie?

699
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.050
She was all we lived for.

700
01:04:46.753 --> 01:04:48.622
Now she's gone.

701
01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.293
She's fucking gone.

702
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.632
And the only thing keeping me
from just fucking ending it...


703
01:05:00.599 --> 01:05:04.137
is that I need to know
what happened.


704
01:05:05.137 --> 01:05:08.409
I need to know why my baby girl
was taken from me.


705
01:05:11.144 --> 01:05:14.148
Why you people killed my girl?

706
01:05:32.264 --> 01:05:36.469
Katie, if you're in there,
if Jess' best friend is still in there...


707
01:05:38.170 --> 01:05:39.773
you owe us answers.

708
01:05:46.378 --> 01:05:48.348
I know you've had
a hard time lately.


709
01:05:49.849 --> 01:05:53.487
And you need to find a way
to survive in this town,


710
01:05:53.519 --> 01:05:57.458
a way to feel loved
and to be a part of something,


711
01:05:57.490 --> 01:06:00.260
and I'm glad you found it,
I really am.


712
01:06:04.731 --> 01:06:09.303
But our little girl's dead.
She's not coming back.


713
01:06:10.369 --> 01:06:15.808
You get to keep living your
life, that's what we're gonna do.


714
01:06:15.842 --> 01:06:20.780
But it's gonna be really hard if we
don't know how or why it happened.


715
01:06:23.182 --> 01:06:24.585
Katie, please.

716
01:06:32.626 --> 01:06:35.662
"Do not withhold punishment
from a child.


717
01:06:35.695 --> 01:06:38.899
If you strike him with a rod,
he will not die.


718
01:06:38.932 --> 01:06:42.303
If you strike him with a rod,
you will save his soul."


719
01:07:11.932 --> 01:07:13.634
Did you want to come?

720
01:07:15.869 --> 01:07:19.606
What is that you want, Jessica?
Is it... is it answers?


721
01:07:20.773 --> 01:07:22.875
I...

722
01:07:22.909 --> 01:07:26.847
Oh, there, there.
That's what we're here for.


723
01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:30.617
We give people what they need even
when they don't know they need it.


724
01:07:31.585 --> 01:07:33.887
Emeth has been so good to me.

725
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:41.494
Emeth has given me comfort
and purpose, meaning


726
01:07:41.527 --> 01:07:46.432
and it will continue to do that
as long as it still stands


727
01:07:46.465 --> 01:07:49.636
long after you and I
have left this mortal world.


728
01:07:56.842 --> 01:08:00.346
I swore an oath
to my husband,


729
01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:05.786
an oath that binds me to stand
behind him no matter what,


730
01:08:05.818 --> 01:08:10.291
even when that means
standing behind his lies.


731
01:08:14.427 --> 01:08:17.531
Such as when he goes to bed
with another man all the while


732
01:08:17.563 --> 01:08:21.534
preaching against
the sins of homosexuality.


733
01:08:26.539 --> 01:08:31.945
Seth goaded my husband,
his lover,


734
01:08:31.977 --> 01:08:34.580
into hitting Arcadia
as punishment,


735
01:08:34.614 --> 01:08:37.784
something that had
never happened to her before.


736
01:08:37.817 --> 01:08:42.923
She ran terrified from the house
and Seth...


737
01:08:47.459 --> 01:08:49.762
What happened was horrible.

738
01:08:50.996 --> 01:08:55.235
I can't even begin to imagine
the kind of pain that you're in.


739
01:09:00.607 --> 01:09:04.544
But again, he's my husband

740
01:09:04.576 --> 01:09:08.815
and I must submit to the life that
he and God have chosen for us.


741
01:09:12.384 --> 01:09:15.655
But although
I stand by his side,


742
01:09:16.656 --> 01:09:22.362
I must understand if God
or one of His servants on Earth


743
01:09:22.394 --> 01:09:26.432
chooses to punish my husband
for his wickedness.


744
01:09:38.911 --> 01:09:41.414
I've left a spare key
in the flowerpot.


745
01:09:42.348 --> 01:09:45.552
I'll be gone this weekend
visiting one of our new outlets.


746
01:09:47.454 --> 01:09:49.456
May God bless you
and be with you.


747
01:10:07.374 --> 01:10:08.474
Jess.

748
01:10:23.389 --> 01:10:25.592
Jess, listen to me, okay?

749
01:10:34.099 --> 01:10:36.070
I don't want to lose you.

750
01:10:43.843 --> 01:10:45.713
But if you want to go,

751
01:10:49.182 --> 01:10:51.050
I'll help you go.

752
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.856
Just tell me...

753
01:10:58.458 --> 01:11:00.494
Just tell me how to help.

754
01:11:06.132 --> 01:11:09.503
- I want...
- Yeah.


755
01:11:11.737 --> 01:11:14.441
I want you to help me
make it right.


756
01:11:20.146 --> 01:11:22.616
Jess,
it won't bring our girl back.


757
01:11:25.919 --> 01:11:29.156
I know that, Thomas. I do.

758
01:11:32.991 --> 01:11:36.929
But I can't sit back and
watch them ruin any more lives.


759
01:11:39.165 --> 01:11:43.702
They come here,
they brainwash people,


760
01:11:43.736 --> 01:11:45.539
they hurt people.

761
01:11:46.873 --> 01:11:49.643
They're hypocrites
and murderers.


762
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:52.012
Yeah.

763
01:11:54.179 --> 01:11:56.115
We are better than that.

764
01:11:58.084 --> 01:12:02.889
Are we? Are we?

765
01:12:05.657 --> 01:12:10.896
You were raised to believe that
there is some higher power


766
01:12:10.929 --> 01:12:13.967
that punishes people
who do evil.


767
01:12:15.802 --> 01:12:18.037
But where is this justice now?

768
01:12:20.572 --> 01:12:22.608
They need to be
held accountable.


769
01:12:29.749 --> 01:12:31.585
Remember what we always said,

770
01:12:32.718 --> 01:12:38.758
we'd be in this together
forever, no matter what.


771
01:12:40.927 --> 01:12:44.932
As long as we had happiness
together, we were good.


772
01:12:48.834 --> 01:12:51.237
And they took that away from us,

773
01:12:52.972 --> 01:12:57.044
time and time again.

774
01:13:01.848 --> 01:13:06.653
Please,
I can't do this without you.


775
01:13:16.763 --> 01:13:18.932
Up, now.

776
01:13:21.334 --> 01:13:22.603
Now!

777
01:13:52.298 --> 01:13:54.701
Say hi to Father, everyone.

778
01:14:02.976 --> 01:14:04.744
Daryll, what are you doing here,
man?


779
01:14:04.776 --> 01:14:07.681
It's nothing personal boss,
she just pays better.


780
01:14:22.128 --> 01:14:26.633
Boy, you ever held a gun before?

781
01:14:26.665 --> 01:14:28.101
There's no fucking way
he's held a gun before...


782
01:14:28.134 --> 01:14:30.704
Seth, please,
this is the Lord's house.


783
01:14:31.903 --> 01:14:35.107
Oh, is that your main concern
right now, my language?


784
01:14:38.143 --> 01:14:40.946
All right, I'll try.

785
01:14:43.348 --> 01:14:45.918
Well, don't you two make
a cute couple.


786
01:14:47.352 --> 01:14:50.723
Don't give me that look,
we know all about you two.


787
01:14:53.259 --> 01:14:56.630
What can I say, Jess,
I'm a good fuck.


788
01:14:59.098 --> 01:15:02.302
What about him?
Is he a good fuck?


789
01:15:03.369 --> 01:15:07.206
Doesn't look like it.
Guy seems like a limp dick pussy.


790
01:15:08.674 --> 01:15:11.811
No wonder your hands are shaking
on that fucking gun.


791
01:15:11.843 --> 01:15:16.015
You never had to do anything really your
entire fucking life. Oh, what are you gonna...


792
01:15:46.079 --> 01:15:49.916
Right, right.

793
01:15:49.949 --> 01:15:51.384
So

794
01:15:52.884 --> 01:15:56.856
I know you're a stickler
for the rules.


795
01:16:00.927 --> 01:16:03.196
Lot of verses in this book.

796
01:16:04.429 --> 01:16:09.402
Lot of verses
about homosexuality.


797
01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:13.740
It's a punishable sin, isn't it?

798
01:16:14.973 --> 01:16:19.244
Personally,
I think that's pretty extreme.


799
01:16:19.277 --> 01:16:22.781
It's so homophobic and hateful.

800
01:16:24.916 --> 01:16:28.155
There are so many worse things than
loving people, don't you think?


801
01:16:29.455 --> 01:16:32.392
Seth, nothing? Hmm.

802
01:16:35.428 --> 01:16:38.732
But they aren't my rules.

803
01:16:44.003 --> 01:16:45.472
They're yours.

804
01:16:46.839 --> 01:16:49.943
And I know how important it is
to Emeth


805
01:16:49.976 --> 01:16:53.380
that you be punished
when you break...


806
01:16:54.480 --> 01:16:58.418
What was it, Michael,
God's rules?


807
01:17:02.355 --> 01:17:06.892
Here's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna untie you.


808
01:17:06.925 --> 01:17:10.929
Then you're gonna take these and you're
gonna stone this sodomite to death.


809
01:17:10.963 --> 01:17:12.766
God be praised.

810
01:17:17.169 --> 01:17:19.239
If you do this...

811
01:17:19.272 --> 01:17:24.878
hey, I promise,
I won't kill you.


812
01:17:25.812 --> 01:17:27.147
But if you refuse...

813
01:17:32.285 --> 01:17:33.820
Get the picture?

814
01:17:51.937 --> 01:17:54.039
You're gonna have
to do better than that.


815
01:18:00.278 --> 01:18:02.115
Again.

816
01:18:02.147 --> 01:18:05.851
Don't be afraid to get in there
and bash his fucking brains in.


817
01:18:17.463 --> 01:18:18.965
Shit.

818
01:18:35.447 --> 01:18:38.450
That's very good.
Very good.


819
01:18:39.584 --> 01:18:43.555
So Matthew 5:29.

820
01:18:43.589 --> 01:18:47.294
Do you know it?
Tell me.


821
01:18:50.028 --> 01:18:51.831
If your...

822
01:18:53.299 --> 01:18:57.137
If your right eye causes you to
sin, cut it out and throw it away.


823
01:19:01.273 --> 01:19:05.579
Very good.
You know what to do.


824
01:20:54.019 --> 01:20:57.123
No. No!

825
01:20:58.124 --> 01:21:01.027
"Touch not my anointed

826
01:21:02.561 --> 01:21:05.365
and do my prophets no harm."

827
01:21:07.199 --> 01:21:09.969
The psalms, really?

828
01:21:11.437 --> 01:21:13.006
Now I...

829
01:21:13.039 --> 01:21:16.142
I fully support
what you did to those boys.


830
01:21:17.343 --> 01:21:19.713
It was wonderfully rooted
in scripture.


831
01:21:22.048 --> 01:21:23.450
And if you...

832
01:21:24.416 --> 01:21:29.188
if you need any help
moving on from what happened,


833
01:21:31.223 --> 01:21:33.727
you have the full support
of Emeth behind you.


834
01:21:41.666 --> 01:21:43.635
Remember what
you used to say, Father,


835
01:21:45.571 --> 01:21:50.110
about how the boss is responsible
for the actions of his employees


836
01:21:51.376 --> 01:21:53.213
and must be held accountable?

837
01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:57.116
That's you, Father.

838
01:21:58.384 --> 01:22:01.488
Guilty by association.

839
01:22:16.367 --> 01:22:18.670
"If anyone should cause

840
01:22:20.306 --> 01:22:24.110
of these little ones harm...

841
01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:31.550
it would be better
that he have a millstone


842
01:22:31.584 --> 01:22:34.220
hung around his neck

843
01:22:34.253 --> 01:22:38.491
and that he be drowned
in the middle of the sea."


844
01:22:41.459 --> 01:22:43.562
Matthew 18:6.

845
01:22:54.572 --> 01:22:57.477
This won't destroy Emeth.

846
01:22:57.509 --> 01:23:00.746
There are thousands,
millions of us.


847
01:23:02.848 --> 01:23:05.285
We have no issue with them.

848
01:23:06.852 --> 01:23:09.489
We are concerned with those

849
01:23:09.522 --> 01:23:13.159
who've done harm to us

850
01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:17.697
and those that we love,

851
01:23:18.864 --> 01:23:24.236
the hypocrites who preach hate
and intolerance,


852
01:23:24.269 --> 01:23:26.606
mass as a path to fulfillment.

853
01:23:29.541 --> 01:23:35.380
You will never poison
another mind


854
01:23:35.414 --> 01:23:37.117
or life.
