2
00:01:01.692 --> 00:01:04.483
'When I was little
and I was in an orphanage,


3
00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:06.942
know what the nuns always said?

4
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.067
An earthquake is
the will of God.


5
00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:12.983
It does the earth good.

6
00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:15.525
Like when someone's not well.

7
00:01:16.858 --> 00:01:18.900
And he lets it build up

8
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.067
until he lets go and erupts.

9
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.608
Or he dies.'

10
00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:44.733
Help!

11
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.983
Ciro! Ciro!

12
00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:37.317
'I sank into hell to understand.

13
00:03:43.358 --> 00:03:46.233
After all we've done to one
other, we're still here.


14
00:03:48.483 --> 00:03:49.858
Just you and me.

15
00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:04.525
- Shoot, I'm over it.
- You can't lie to me.


16
00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:07.150
Killing your kids' mother
is something you can't forget.


17
00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.442
Shoot!

18
00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:24.233
I killed my Debora
with these two hands.


19
00:04:24.983 --> 00:04:27.233
I woulda killed anyone
who came between us.


20
00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:38.525
This is Ciro Di Marzio,
the boss of Secondigliano!


21
00:04:38.775 --> 00:04:40.025
None of our fuckin'
business!'


22
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.692
He's alive!

23
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.900
'I spent my whole life
with death close by.


24
00:04:59.483 --> 00:05:01.233
I'm not afraid of dying.'

25
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.400
THE IMMORTAL

26
00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.108
So, it's true what they say.

27
00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.317
No one can kill the Immortal.

28
00:06:15.983 --> 00:06:18.150
The shot they fired
into your chest


29
00:06:18.608 --> 00:06:20.608
stopped a centimeter
from your heart.


30
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.442
I need to smoke,
got a cigarette?


31
00:06:47.358 --> 00:06:49.108
Where's Gennaro?

32
00:06:50.275 --> 00:06:52.275
Your brother's fine.

33
00:06:52.942 --> 00:06:56.317
While you were in the coma
he retired with his family.


34
00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:00.983
Why are you keeping me locked
in here like a prisoner?


35
00:07:01.858 --> 00:07:06.900
If you're in here it's because
no one must know you're alive.


36
00:07:12.483 --> 00:07:15.317
Otherwise, I don't know
how this story ends.


37
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.483
God wanted you alive,

38
00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:24.358
he gave you another chance.

39
00:07:24.608 --> 00:07:27.192
It'd be a sin if you didn't
make the most of it.


40
00:07:28.317 --> 00:07:31.567
Besides, there's no one
waiting for you out there.


41
00:07:33.942 --> 00:07:36.067
You gotta go away, Ciru.

42
00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:41.358
Far away.

43
00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:45.400
I'm opening
an important channel.


44
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.733
And I need someone like you.

45
00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:58.442
I can give you a new life.

46
00:07:59.567 --> 00:08:01.067
Think about it.

47
00:09:04.233 --> 00:09:05.775
Ciro Di Marzio?

48
00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:07.817
Dimitri.

49
00:09:08.942 --> 00:09:10.442
Welcome.

50
00:10:53.275 --> 00:10:55.108
Yuri Dobeshenko.

51
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.733
I can see the whole city
from here.


52
00:11:03.983 --> 00:11:07.608
This is the tallest skyscraper
in all of Latvia.


53
00:11:09.483 --> 00:11:14.817
The Latvians were part
of the great Soviet Union,


54
00:11:15.067 --> 00:11:17.358
but they wanted independence

55
00:11:17.608 --> 00:11:20.858
and have become
the asshole of Europe.


56
00:11:25.442 --> 00:11:27.567
They didn't understand

57
00:11:27.817 --> 00:11:31.233
that we Russians
are still the masters here


58
00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:34.192
because we command the economy.

59
00:11:36.942 --> 00:11:39.525
Don Aniello spoke
very well of you,


60
00:11:39.775 --> 00:11:42.233
I'm sure we'll do
excellent business together.


61
00:11:44.775 --> 00:11:46.442
The shipment's on its way.

62
00:11:46.692 --> 00:11:48.567
The day after tomorrow
we'll deliver.


63
00:11:48.817 --> 00:11:51.525
Good, Dimitri will
let you know where.


64
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.608
Escort the young man.

65
00:12:49.317 --> 00:12:50.983
Let's go.

66
00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.483
Friends.

67
00:13:47.608 --> 00:13:50.275
I lived in Italy for two years.

68
00:13:52.358 --> 00:13:55.067
Your country is beautiful, too.

69
00:14:46.942 --> 00:14:49.275
He's Emils, our boss.

70
00:14:49.942 --> 00:14:52.567
He welcomes you to our home.

71
00:14:53.442 --> 00:14:55.650
It didn't look like
a welcome to me.


72
00:15:10.108 --> 00:15:13.692
The Russian pigs believe
they command in our home.


73
00:15:13.942 --> 00:15:16.567
They believe they can invade
Latvia again


74
00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:18.025
with their filthy money,

75
00:15:18.275 --> 00:15:20.275
but they're wrong.

76
00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.150
That's why we need your cocaine.

77
00:15:23.942 --> 00:15:26.358
I'm not interested in your wars.

78
00:15:26.775 --> 00:15:28.692
I'm a broker,

79
00:15:28.942 --> 00:15:31.483
I deliver the drugs
on behalf of a seller


80
00:15:31.733 --> 00:15:33.775
and my seller
has a deal with the Russians.


81
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.150
If you want to be a broker,

82
00:15:36.567 --> 00:15:38.567
first you have
to be alive, Italian.


83
00:15:40.108 --> 00:15:42.983
We know the Russians pay

84
00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:45.692
we Latvians pay 21.

85
00:15:46.692 --> 00:15:49.067
Either you do business with us,

86
00:15:49.317 --> 00:15:51.483
or you can die
with the Russians.


87
00:15:53.317 --> 00:15:56.692
But is it worth dying for a war
that's not yours?


88
00:16:00.817 --> 00:16:03.192
We need an answer soon.

89
00:16:31.567 --> 00:16:33.775
- 'Ciru.'
- Don Aniello.


90
00:16:34.442 --> 00:16:37.692
'The shipment's cleared Customs,
it's on its way.


91
00:16:38.275 --> 00:16:41.525
Tomorrow morning I'll send one
of my people to get you.'


92
00:16:43.983 --> 00:16:45.525
I'm on it.

93
00:17:39.442 --> 00:17:41.357
Good morning, Don Ciro.

94
00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:48.275
Don Aniello sent me
to pick you up.


95
00:17:54.733 --> 00:17:58.525
We'll take my van,
so I can show you around.


96
00:19:39.025 --> 00:19:41.483
They're our containers.

97
00:19:42.817 --> 00:19:46.525
I got them outta Customs,
we have a warehouse.


98
00:19:46.775 --> 00:19:48.567
We'll take it all there.

99
00:19:48.817 --> 00:19:51.817
We'll go there now
so you can meet the others.


100
00:19:52.775 --> 00:19:54.983
That's not merchandise,

101
00:19:55.233 --> 00:19:56.858
it's personal stuff.

102
00:19:58.108 --> 00:20:00.733
It goes to the place you got me.

103
00:20:01.108 --> 00:20:03.108
No problem, I'm on it.

104
00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:34.067
All good, we can go.

105
00:21:11.942 --> 00:21:15.942
Guys, we're honored to have
the man Don Aniello sent us.


106
00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:20.692
He's with us now and we're
at his disposal for anything.


107
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:23.483
Virgilio.

108
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.525
He's my right-hand man.

109
00:21:30.567 --> 00:21:33.442
He handles relations
with the people in Naples.


110
00:21:34.567 --> 00:21:38.108
He's my pride,
I raised him like a son.


111
00:21:40.067 --> 00:21:41.858
We've been expecting you.

112
00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.942
Your place is near mine,
for anything, ask me or my wife.


113
00:21:50.483 --> 00:21:52.358
Pasquale, he handles

114
00:21:52.442 --> 00:21:53.733
the contacts
with people at the port.


115
00:21:54.067 --> 00:21:56.150
If you need anything, ask me.

116
00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.192
Eligio is our best seller.

117
00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:01.400
Bruno's exaggerating,
I just do my job.


118
00:22:02.275 --> 00:22:05.233
Franco and Salvatore,
logistics and warehouse.


119
00:22:05.483 --> 00:22:07.525
- Nice to meet you, Don Ciro.
- Hello.


120
00:22:08.608 --> 00:22:10.317
This is my crew.

121
00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.275
All the counterfeit goods
in this country


122
00:22:13.775 --> 00:22:15.150
come out of this warehouse.

123
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.025
When it comes to knockoffs,
we're the best.


124
00:22:20.025 --> 00:22:22.025
C'mon, guys, back to work!

125
00:22:23.817 --> 00:22:26.067
Now I'll take you
to see the workshop.


126
00:22:26.942 --> 00:22:30.275
Where we turn market rags
into designer clothes.


127
00:22:31.108 --> 00:22:32.608
Come with me.

128
00:22:41.733 --> 00:22:44.067
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Bruno.


129
00:22:44.858 --> 00:22:46.358
Everything all right?

130
00:22:46.858 --> 00:22:48.192
Come.

131
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:51.775
Elga, Pasquale's wife.
Annunziata, Eligio's wife,


132
00:22:52.025 --> 00:22:53.483
Dora, Franco's wife.

133
00:22:54.775 --> 00:22:56.025
Vera.

134
00:23:00.692 --> 00:23:04.150
Virgilio's wife, she got
the apartment ready for you.


135
00:23:08.442 --> 00:23:10.775
The apartment? All in order?

136
00:23:11.025 --> 00:23:13.858
- I did what you told me.
- Well done.


137
00:23:14.692 --> 00:23:16.567
I'll get back to work,
excuse me.


138
00:23:18.567 --> 00:23:19.900
If I may.

139
00:23:22.192 --> 00:23:23.733
Let's go.

140
00:23:52.733 --> 00:23:55.400
The furniture's arrived. Come.

141
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.650
This is Vera
and Virgilio's apartment,


142
00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:07.400
Franco and Eligio
live upstairs with their wives.


143
00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:10.567
They're all good people,
easy-going, you saw them.


144
00:24:11.108 --> 00:24:12.858
No one will bother you.

145
00:24:14.567 --> 00:24:16.567
I'm further down.

146
00:24:16.817 --> 00:24:19.858
If you need anything, I'm here.

147
00:24:24.192 --> 00:24:25.900
You're on the ground floor,

148
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:29.275
the entrance is here,
first door on the right.


149
00:24:38.692 --> 00:24:40.817
The days never end here.

150
00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.192
At this time of the year,
they last for 20 hours.


151
00:24:45.483 --> 00:24:47.775
I had shutter blinds
put in for you.


152
00:24:48.233 --> 00:24:50.317
Or else it's hard to sleep.

153
00:24:57.067 --> 00:25:00.817
You can go now,
I need to get some rest.


154
00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:28.358
Good morning.

155
00:25:28.608 --> 00:25:30.150
Let's go, come on.

156
00:26:04.483 --> 00:26:05.567
What are you doing here?

157
00:26:06.067 --> 00:26:08.525
I want to learn the trade,
can I watch?


158
00:26:09.858 --> 00:26:11.900
But don't touch anything.

159
00:26:22.025 --> 00:26:23.025
Hey!

160
00:26:31.942 --> 00:26:33.358
Stop!

161
00:26:41.442 --> 00:26:43.400
Thief! Stop!

162
00:27:20.108 --> 00:27:22.025
Bruno!

163
00:27:26.358 --> 00:27:27.608
Ciru!

164
00:27:29.567 --> 00:27:31.608
- Did you get what I asked for?
- Here.


165
00:27:31.858 --> 00:27:33.400
You're a legend!

166
00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.108
Ciru! Lover boy!

167
00:27:39.192 --> 00:27:40.775
Break up these spark plugs.

168
00:27:49.192 --> 00:27:51.233
There's ceramic
in the spark plugs


169
00:27:51.317 --> 00:27:53.483
that we need. Look and learn.

170
00:27:56.983 --> 00:27:58.608
Cool!

171
00:28:05.275 --> 00:28:06.567
Bruno!

172
00:28:06.817 --> 00:28:08.525
Tell us the story of Blackbird.

173
00:28:08.775 --> 00:28:10.067
You never tell it anymore.

174
00:28:10.317 --> 00:28:12.108
- What can I tell you?
- Everything.


175
00:28:12.358 --> 00:28:14.817
He's number one,
no one's ever stopped him.


176
00:28:15.067 --> 00:28:17.608
Tell 'em why
he's called Blackbird.


177
00:28:18.483 --> 00:28:20.400
You wanna know?

178
00:28:20.650 --> 00:28:21.775
You can tell them.

179
00:28:22.025 --> 00:28:24.150
He pilots a speedboat
like he's flying on water.


180
00:28:24.525 --> 00:28:27.400
- Like lightning.
- He flies for real!


181
00:28:28.025 --> 00:28:30.733
Once he had seven police boats
after him.


182
00:28:30.983 --> 00:28:33.567
Seven! It was at night,
the sea was stormy.


183
00:28:33.817 --> 00:28:35.608
- They caught him...
- As if!


184
00:28:35.858 --> 00:28:38.025
He was going so fast
he caught on fire.


185
00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.817
Him, his speedboat
and the cops on his tail.


186
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.817
When did you meet him?

187
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.775
A year ago, outside the Red
Bloom. I was with Stella.


188
00:28:48.608 --> 00:28:51.900
He pulled up in an amazing car,
he was with two six-foot babes.


189
00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.317
- Six foot!
- They were hot.


190
00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:57.900
How was he dressed?

191
00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:01.317
In this mind-blowing fur coat,
he looked like a lion.


192
00:29:02.567 --> 00:29:03.608
You got it.

193
00:29:03.858 --> 00:29:05.817
Everyone kissed his hands.

194
00:29:06.067 --> 00:29:07.942
And he gave money to everyone.

195
00:29:08.233 --> 00:29:09.858
How do you get to be like that?

196
00:29:10.483 --> 00:29:13.692
Never trust anyone
and never be afraid of anything.


197
00:29:14.567 --> 00:29:15.942
I'm not afraid of anything.

198
00:29:16.192 --> 00:29:17.567
- You're not afraid?
- No.


199
00:29:17.817 --> 00:29:20.442
- Not even of dying?
- He's the Immortal.


200
00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:22.442
It's true, he's the Immortal.

201
00:29:22.692 --> 00:29:24.358
But I don't want to die.

202
00:29:24.608 --> 00:29:25.942
- You don't want to die?
- No.


203
00:29:26.192 --> 00:29:28.442
Then this life's not for you.

204
00:29:29.942 --> 00:29:31.692
Do you want to become like him?

205
00:29:32.525 --> 00:29:33.400
Me?

206
00:29:33.983 --> 00:29:36.067
Even stronger.

207
00:29:36.775 --> 00:29:37.775
Let's go, guys.

208
00:29:38.025 --> 00:29:40.525
Guys, back to work!
See you later.


209
00:29:45.442 --> 00:29:47.650
Two in the back,
one in the front.


210
00:30:27.733 --> 00:30:29.233
Move!

211
00:30:41.442 --> 00:30:42.692
Bruno, here!

212
00:31:05.067 --> 00:31:06.817
What a masterpiece.
Let's hit it!


213
00:31:07.067 --> 00:31:07.983
Go!

214
00:31:08.608 --> 00:31:10.025
Go! Faster!

215
00:31:10.483 --> 00:31:11.900
Good job.

216
00:31:37.483 --> 00:31:39.275
Bye, Nunzio. Bye, Bruno.

217
00:31:40.317 --> 00:31:41.692
See you, guys.

218
00:31:58.858 --> 00:32:00.942
Will you give me a cigarette?

219
00:32:10.692 --> 00:32:13.275
- We did good today.
- You did good, Ciru.


220
00:32:13.525 --> 00:32:15.067
Night, Bruno. Night, Nunzio.

221
00:32:15.317 --> 00:32:16.650
Night, Ciru.

222
00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:22.483
Let's hit the hay.

223
00:32:42.025 --> 00:32:43.358
Night, dude.

224
00:32:43.608 --> 00:32:45.233
Night, everyone.

225
00:32:45.817 --> 00:32:47.817
That was a masterpiece we did!

226
00:33:06.733 --> 00:33:08.442
Night, guys.

227
00:34:53.983 --> 00:34:57.692
- Dad, did you bring it?
- No, I forgot!


228
00:34:59.025 --> 00:35:01.650
No, I told you a hundred times!

229
00:35:03.525 --> 00:35:04.900
Here!

230
00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:11.025
You like it?

231
00:35:39.442 --> 00:35:41.733
- Hi, Bruno.
- Hi.


232
00:35:41.982 --> 00:35:44.317
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.


233
00:35:44.858 --> 00:35:46.400
The usual?

234
00:35:46.649 --> 00:35:48.317
Vodka, please.

235
00:35:55.983 --> 00:35:58.775
Did something happen?
Is your place okay?


236
00:35:59.025 --> 00:36:01.025
I didn't come here to chat.

237
00:36:02.192 --> 00:36:04.567
I got a problem, 
I need a hand.

238
00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.358
But it's not gonna be easy.

239
00:36:12.483 --> 00:36:15.025
I'd do anything for you.

240
00:36:31.192 --> 00:36:33.442
Dad, when are we going?

241
00:36:33.817 --> 00:36:35.192
Mama!

242
00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.608
I can't get my jacket on.

243
00:36:48.275 --> 00:36:50.483
Are were going to the rides too?

244
00:36:51.442 --> 00:36:53.025
Yes, we're going to the rides.

245
00:37:01.358 --> 00:37:02.650
They're here.

246
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:05.650
Come with Dad.

247
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:12.775
Let's go.

248
00:40:31.067 --> 00:40:33.442
You made the right choice,

249
00:40:33.692 --> 00:40:35.192
broker.

250
00:40:35.483 --> 00:40:37.650
We're the winning horse.

251
00:42:26.608 --> 00:42:28.275
Follow me.

252
00:43:03.775 --> 00:43:06.317
It's a pleasure doing
business with you.


253
00:43:18.233 --> 00:43:20.317
From this moment

254
00:43:20.775 --> 00:43:23.275
you and I are brothers.

255
00:43:42.275 --> 00:43:44.733
You will have my protection

256
00:43:44.983 --> 00:43:46.900
and my blessing.

257
00:44:09.275 --> 00:44:11.608
Come with me, Annarella.

258
00:44:22.358 --> 00:44:24.942
- It went well, right?
- We totally killed it.


259
00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.942
We did a good job.

260
00:44:27.192 --> 00:44:29.275
Yeah, but what happens now?

261
00:44:32.983 --> 00:44:35.150
Now we'll see, he's on his way.

262
00:44:36.442 --> 00:44:38.650
Nothing must happen.

263
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.775
We made a mistake.

264
00:44:48.025 --> 00:44:50.858
We got nothing to do
with trafficking.


265
00:44:51.108 --> 00:44:53.775
Vera's right,
these things are dangerous.


266
00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:56.650
It's true, but maybe things
can change.


267
00:44:57.192 --> 00:45:00.150
If we get into this business,
we'll stop starving to death.


268
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.650
But we're not starving
to death, Bruno.


269
00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.608
What we have
isn't enough anymore,


270
00:45:04.858 --> 00:45:06.983
I'm fucking sick
of keeping my head down.


271
00:45:07.233 --> 00:45:08.983
What's gotten into you?

272
00:45:09.733 --> 00:45:11.692
You've never done these things.

273
00:45:12.733 --> 00:45:15.858
You've worked all your life
with rags running scams.


274
00:45:17.775 --> 00:45:19.567
That's what we are.

275
00:45:23.525 --> 00:45:25.358
This is our life.

276
00:45:27.067 --> 00:45:29.567
You think I'm not up to it,
don't you?


277
00:45:35.192 --> 00:45:37.025
I'm scared, Virgilio.

278
00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:54.067
Good evening, Don Ciro.

279
00:46:08.233 --> 00:46:10.150
This is for you.

280
00:46:28.608 --> 00:46:30.983
Holy mother, so much money!

281
00:46:33.608 --> 00:46:35.983
If you want,
you can work with me.


282
00:46:36.817 --> 00:46:39.150
There are advantages, risks too.

283
00:46:40.483 --> 00:46:43.442
You're giving us an exceptional
opportunity, thank you.


284
00:46:43.692 --> 00:46:46.233
Don Aniello never trusted us
this much.


285
00:46:46.483 --> 00:46:48.900
From now on, my word is enough.

286
00:46:50.608 --> 00:46:54.233
But it's not a game, it's
a big deal. Think about it.


287
00:46:55.733 --> 00:46:57.525
The choice is yours.

288
00:46:58.442 --> 00:47:01.275
Are we sure
that we have a choice?


289
00:47:03.442 --> 00:47:06.275
In life there's always a choice.

290
00:47:09.525 --> 00:47:11.192
What's hard is turning back.

291
00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.067
Ciro!

292
00:47:52.358 --> 00:47:55.775
Today I felt alive
for the first time in 30 years.


293
00:48:00.567 --> 00:48:03.358
I've never forgotten you, Ciru.

294
00:48:14.525 --> 00:48:16.608
Guys, wake up!

295
00:48:16.983 --> 00:48:18.942
- Hurry up.
- Close it!


296
00:48:19.358 --> 00:48:20.942
Wake up.

297
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.358
- Close the window!
- No, we gotta go.


298
00:48:28.483 --> 00:48:29.525
Ciru.

299
00:48:32.192 --> 00:48:34.817
Wake up, I got
a surprise for you.


300
00:48:35.317 --> 00:48:37.150
Let's go, hurry up.

301
00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.108
So you didn't hear me!
Don't you wanna wake up?


302
00:48:48.067 --> 00:48:50.233
Stop being foolish!

303
00:49:18.025 --> 00:49:20.817
Guys, eat whatever you want!

304
00:50:35.942 --> 00:50:36.942
Go!

305
00:51:04.608 --> 00:51:07.483
One hundred, two hundred,
three hundred...


306
00:51:07.942 --> 00:51:09.233
four hundred.

307
00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:12.150
Here's 450.

308
00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.233
- How did you split it up?
- Half as usual.


309
00:51:15.483 --> 00:51:17.192
They said 100 for the stereos.

310
00:51:17.442 --> 00:51:21.233
That's what my contact gives us,
take it or leave it.


311
00:51:23.317 --> 00:51:26.317
- He's a shitty contact.
- Have you got another one?


312
00:51:29.358 --> 00:51:31.775
We bust our asses for peanuts.

313
00:51:33.358 --> 00:51:35.525
Guys, your share.

314
00:51:38.942 --> 00:51:40.233
Ciru!

315
00:51:42.525 --> 00:51:43.525
Good boy.

316
00:51:43.775 --> 00:51:45.900
Bruno, go outside,
they want to see you.


317
00:51:47.317 --> 00:51:48.733
Move.

318
00:52:18.108 --> 00:52:19.692
Be good.

319
00:52:29.733 --> 00:52:31.525
- Who was that, Blackbird?
- Yeah.


320
00:52:31.775 --> 00:52:32.775
What did he say?

321
00:52:33.025 --> 00:52:35.942
He'll let me in on the cigarette
smuggling, my time has come.


322
00:52:36.192 --> 00:52:38.733
Bro, now you can buy
everyone a drink.


323
00:52:39.817 --> 00:52:42.025
Drink? Tonight I'll take you
to dinner!


324
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:47.025
Way to go, bro!
I'm gonna stuff myself.


325
00:52:47.275 --> 00:52:48.650
And what's the problem?

326
00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:50.025
Ciru...

327
00:52:51.317 --> 00:52:53.775
Let's take them to hear
an angel sing?


328
00:52:54.025 --> 00:52:55.483
Stella?

329
00:53:29.733 --> 00:53:30.900
She's good, isn't she?

330
00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:50.442
Brava!

331
00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.942
Will you let my friend sing?

332
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:59.733
Will you let him sing a song?

333
00:54:01.442 --> 00:54:03.900
Bruno! Bruno!

334
00:54:05.525 --> 00:54:09.108
- Sit down...
- It's all right, it's okay.


335
00:54:22.275 --> 00:54:25.275
She's too good.
Are you under her spell, Ciru?


336
00:54:37.233 --> 00:54:39.358
Brava! Brava, Stella!

337
00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.192
Brava, you were great.

338
00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:46.983
You were amazing.

339
00:54:48.025 --> 00:54:49.442
- Did you like it?
- A lot.


340
00:54:49.692 --> 00:54:51.817
I sang that song for you.

341
00:54:53.817 --> 00:54:56.192
Another round of applause
for the singer!


342
00:54:58.775 --> 00:55:00.900
You were too good.

343
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:04.067
I want you to sing
at my wedding.


344
00:55:04.358 --> 00:55:06.650
- But you gotta pay me.
- Bastard!


345
00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:09.108
Let's make a toast,
pass the bottle.


346
00:55:09.358 --> 00:55:12.150
- That was really moving.
- And you're beautiful.


347
00:55:13.067 --> 00:55:14.817
Me too, just a little.

348
00:55:15.067 --> 00:55:16.567
Come on, just a little.

349
00:55:16.817 --> 00:55:18.192
He's a kid.

350
00:55:20.942 --> 00:55:22.733
- What are we toasting to?
- To Stella.


351
00:55:22.983 --> 00:55:25.900
To Stella? To the singer
and to smuggling!


352
00:55:27.275 --> 00:55:29.483
We're gonna make money!

353
00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.942
You were amazing, baby.

354
00:55:33.067 --> 00:55:37.525
Ciru, you got nothing to say?
Did you like the song?


355
00:55:37.775 --> 00:55:41.400
Yeah, I think you're gonna be
the best singer in the world!


356
00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:43.483
Of course, she's my Stella!

357
00:55:45.192 --> 00:55:47.358
- Sing again!
- I've fucking had enough!


358
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:51.567
Let's go! Move it! Come with me!

359
00:55:51.817 --> 00:55:55.650
It's all right,
nothing happened. Keep eating.


360
00:59:14.525 --> 00:59:15.692
Ciro!

361
00:59:17.108 --> 00:59:19.025
You coming to the party tonight?

362
00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:21.983
The kids really want you to.

363
00:59:22.233 --> 00:59:23.858
I dunno.

364
00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:26.400
All right.

365
00:59:38.192 --> 00:59:39.900
The shit's here.

366
00:59:40.775 --> 00:59:42.525
Got any news for me?

367
00:59:42.775 --> 00:59:44.442
Virgilio, has my package
arrived?


368
00:59:44.525 --> 00:59:45.775
Yeah, man, it's all here!

369
00:59:46.025 --> 00:59:47.900
Let's go see.

370
00:59:50.192 --> 00:59:51.400
Let's go.

371
00:59:58.483 --> 00:59:59.983
A guy who escorted the cargo

372
01:00:00.108 --> 01:00:01.733
said the situation's not good
in Naples.


373
01:00:02.817 --> 01:00:05.317
The cops have seized
another shipment,


374
01:00:05.567 --> 01:00:07.692
now they're all fighting
each other.


375
01:00:08.858 --> 01:00:12.817
They all say that Don Gennaro
Savastano was right to get out.


376
01:00:14.275 --> 01:00:16.400
But he's fine,

377
01:00:16.650 --> 01:00:19.442
he bought himself
a nice villa in Posillipo.


378
01:00:19.692 --> 01:00:21.733
He's got a new life.

379
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:32.192
You two were friends,
weren't you?


380
01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.525
We were brothers.

381
01:00:43.525 --> 01:00:46.317
But I'd never have shot
a brother.


382
01:00:48.733 --> 01:00:51.067
I asked him to.

383
01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:55.275
You? Why?

384
01:00:57.942 --> 01:01:00.775
Because he had
a good reason to live.


385
01:01:03.817 --> 01:01:07.817
After everything you did,
you ended up in this shithole.


386
01:01:08.067 --> 01:01:09.525
Why are you here, Virgilio?

387
01:01:13.733 --> 01:01:15.358
The truth?

388
01:01:18.483 --> 01:01:20.858
I don't have the balls
to change things.


389
01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.108
If I did, maybe my wife
would love me again.


390
01:01:27.358 --> 01:01:31.067
- Your wife loves you.
- Yeah, like a dimwit brother.


391
01:01:31.317 --> 01:01:34.275
You think that
and do nothing to change it?


392
01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:37.192
If I was like you, then yes,

393
01:01:37.442 --> 01:01:39.900
but you can't buy courage.

394
01:01:44.733 --> 01:01:47.067
But I don't have any courage.

395
01:01:49.983 --> 01:01:53.192
I'm not afraid only 'cause
I got nothing left to lose.


396
01:01:56.567 --> 01:02:00.567
When I had to defend my family
I wasn't up to it.


397
01:02:01.025 --> 01:02:03.108
I lost everyone.

398
01:02:06.733 --> 01:02:09.192
But now you have a family.

399
01:02:09.775 --> 01:02:12.650
Look after your family
better than I did.


400
01:03:33.775 --> 01:03:35.817
The new shipment has arrived.

401
01:03:39.567 --> 01:03:41.858
We'll deliver it tomorrow.

402
01:03:45.608 --> 01:03:48.983
How long have we been
doing good business together,


403
01:03:49.233 --> 01:03:50.900
my dear Ciro?

404
01:03:52.192 --> 01:03:54.192
- A year.
- A year...


405
01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:59.483
A lot of things
have changed, haven't they?


406
01:04:00.692 --> 01:04:02.983
I was right,

407
01:04:03.233 --> 01:04:06.108
we won our war.

408
01:04:24.192 --> 01:04:26.608
There's a strange light
in this city.


409
01:04:26.858 --> 01:04:30.650
A lot of people say
this light drives them crazy.


410
01:04:33.025 --> 01:04:35.817
Partners for a year
and no problems


411
01:04:36.025 --> 01:04:37.233
calls for a celebration.

412
01:04:38.067 --> 01:04:39.567
Until morning.

413
01:04:39.817 --> 01:04:41.400
I already have plans tonight.

414
01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:44.442
You always have plans.

415
01:04:44.692 --> 01:04:47.483
Like a guy with a family

416
01:04:47.733 --> 01:04:50.567
who has to go home at night.

417
01:04:53.358 --> 01:04:55.358
You know as well as me,

418
01:04:55.608 --> 01:04:59.942
people like us
can't afford to have families.


419
01:05:42.900 --> 01:05:45.025
Happy birthday, Tommaso!

420
01:07:01.275 --> 01:07:02.525
Ciru!

421
01:07:07.692 --> 01:07:09.733
Gimme a cigarette.

422
01:07:18.775 --> 01:07:20.942
Everyone likes you.

423
01:07:21.192 --> 01:07:23.317
They look up to you as a boss.

424
01:07:23.567 --> 01:07:25.650
I see you together with them,

425
01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:28.192
they've become your posse.

426
01:07:29.442 --> 01:07:31.442
What are you talking about?

427
01:07:31.692 --> 01:07:32.900
It's true.

428
01:07:33.192 --> 01:07:35.358
I'm getting old.

429
01:07:42.775 --> 01:07:43.900
Ciru...

430
01:07:46.317 --> 01:07:48.400
I need to tell you something.

431
01:07:52.067 --> 01:07:55.483
I've decided the time has come
for me to go back to Naples.


432
01:07:56.525 --> 01:07:58.733
I want to go home.

433
01:08:00.733 --> 01:08:03.025
- When?
- Next week.


434
01:08:07.233 --> 01:08:09.150
So soon?

435
01:08:09.900 --> 01:08:12.400
I've already organized
everything,


436
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:14.525
it's all set.

437
01:08:17.192 --> 01:08:21.025
I thought of leaving Virgilio
in charge of the posse,


438
01:08:21.275 --> 01:08:23.525
if you don't have
a problem with that.


439
01:08:26.317 --> 01:08:28.150
No problem.

440
01:08:29.483 --> 01:08:32.150
What's good for you
is good for me.


441
01:08:37.608 --> 01:08:39.233
Thank you, Ciru.

442
01:08:46.775 --> 01:08:47.983
Good night, Bruno.

443
01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:16.733
Last night
we had a really good time.


444
01:09:16.983 --> 01:09:18.733
- We all had fun.
- Thank you.


445
01:09:18.983 --> 01:09:21.317
The green dress looked
great on you.


446
01:09:21.942 --> 01:09:23.775
No one could keep
their eyes off you.


447
01:09:23.858 --> 01:09:24.983
If you say so...

448
01:09:26.067 --> 01:09:29.025
- Ciro was looking at you, too.
- Yeah, he was.


449
01:09:29.275 --> 01:09:31.317
What the fuck
are you talking about?


450
01:09:32.025 --> 01:09:33.608
Why are you getting mad?

451
01:09:33.858 --> 01:09:35.567
What's gotten into her?

452
01:09:36.317 --> 01:09:37.567
You don't understand anything.

453
01:09:37.817 --> 01:09:40.150
- You don't see what I see.
- What do you see?


454
01:09:42.067 --> 01:09:44.275
I see a lonely man,

455
01:09:44.525 --> 01:09:46.483
with no desires anymore.

456
01:10:12.358 --> 01:10:14.317
I brought your clean stuff.

457
01:10:15.233 --> 01:10:17.317
If I'm disturbing you
I'll come later.


458
01:10:18.858 --> 01:10:20.483
Come in.

459
01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:10.275
I changed your sheets.

460
01:11:13.192 --> 01:11:14.817
I'm done.

461
01:11:21.442 --> 01:11:23.150
I didn't want you.

462
01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.775
I didn't want you in my house.

463
01:11:31.858 --> 01:11:33.774
I was scared of you.

464
01:11:37.233 --> 01:11:39.442
Then after a while, I realized,

465
01:11:42.692 --> 01:11:44.442
I judged you wrong.

466
01:11:52.608 --> 01:11:54.566
Then things changed.

467
01:11:58.525 --> 01:12:00.192
What changed?

468
01:12:02.899 --> 01:12:04.941
Now I'm glad you're here.

469
01:12:27.025 --> 01:12:30.608
<i>Ciru, what are you doing
to your hair?</i>


470
01:12:30.858 --> 01:12:32.900
<i>You going to your lover?</i>

471
01:12:36.817 --> 01:12:38.442
Ciro, where are you going?

472
01:12:38.692 --> 01:12:40.483
It's true, where you going?

473
01:12:40.858 --> 01:12:42.775
C'mon, just tell me.

474
01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:45.858
I get it, I think he's in love.

475
01:12:46.358 --> 01:12:47.983
True, he might be.

476
01:12:49.233 --> 01:12:50.733
What's that look for?

477
01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.942
Get outta here, go on...

478
01:12:53.192 --> 01:12:54.775
Leave him alone!

479
01:12:58.525 --> 01:13:01.567
Ciro! Where you going
with that sharp hairdo?


480
01:13:01.817 --> 01:13:03.733
He's in love!

481
01:13:11.067 --> 01:13:14.817
Look how spiffy he is!
He even did his hair!


482
01:13:15.067 --> 01:13:17.108
Where you going,
to see your girlfriend?


483
01:14:00.483 --> 01:14:02.483
Thanks for the gelato, Ciru.

484
01:14:03.108 --> 01:14:04.525
You're welcome.

485
01:14:20.150 --> 01:14:22.150
This gelato's good, huh?

486
01:14:27.775 --> 01:14:29.858
I got you a present.

487
01:14:43.067 --> 01:14:44.233
They're beautiful.

488
01:14:44.692 --> 01:14:47.233
You deserve
the finest things in life.


489
01:14:48.233 --> 01:14:49.483
Why?

490
01:14:50.067 --> 01:14:51.650
Because you're an angel.

491
01:14:53.608 --> 01:14:55.442
I'm not an angel.

492
01:14:57.442 --> 01:14:59.150
Why do you say that?

493
01:15:01.317 --> 01:15:03.858
Because angels are in heaven.

494
01:15:06.692 --> 01:15:08.942
The nuns at the orphanage

495
01:15:10.192 --> 01:15:13.692
said that Mama was an angel
and that she was in heaven.


496
01:15:15.983 --> 01:15:17.775
Do you remember your mama?

497
01:15:18.025 --> 01:15:19.942
How could I?

498
01:15:22.108 --> 01:15:24.567
She left me
when I was two months old.


499
01:15:24.817 --> 01:15:26.150
Why?

500
01:15:28.358 --> 01:15:30.317
Because she didn't want me.

501
01:15:33.650 --> 01:15:36.025
But I always want you
with me, Stella.


502
01:15:44.733 --> 01:15:47.275
Let's go, I gotta get to work.

503
01:16:03.608 --> 01:16:05.358
What the fuck's that?

504
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:12.067
Who the fuck are they?

505
01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:15.233
What the fuck's going on?

506
01:16:15.483 --> 01:16:18.567
What do you want? You know
who this stuff belongs to?


507
01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:20.817
You know whose cocaine this is?

508
01:16:21.358 --> 01:16:22.983
You know whose cocaine this is?

509
01:16:23.233 --> 01:16:25.150
Get off me, Bruno!

510
01:16:25.650 --> 01:16:26.983
Get off me!

511
01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:39.150
Who the fuck are you?

512
01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.025
Whaddaya want?

513
01:16:46.192 --> 01:16:48.275
Piece of shit!

514
01:17:10.983 --> 01:17:12.650
I'm sorry, Ciro.

515
01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.483
But you have to come with me.

516
01:17:18.025 --> 01:17:20.192
Take the kids inside.

517
01:17:21.442 --> 01:17:23.067
I said go!

518
01:17:44.650 --> 01:17:47.233
I lost four of my men

519
01:17:47.483 --> 01:17:50.442
and 150 kilos of cocaine
and I want it back.


520
01:17:50.942 --> 01:17:52.567
Only you knew.

521
01:17:52.817 --> 01:17:55.483
You knew when the shipment
was arriving.


522
01:17:55.733 --> 01:17:57.942
Some of you like talking.

523
01:18:06.358 --> 01:18:07.358
Virgilio...

524
01:18:11.567 --> 01:18:12.692
Ciru...

525
01:18:13.858 --> 01:18:16.025
It wasn't us.

526
01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:18.900
I swear, we didn't betray you.

527
01:18:19.150 --> 01:18:20.817
I know.

528
01:18:22.692 --> 01:18:24.317
See?

529
01:18:25.567 --> 01:18:27.525
I wasn't scared.

530
01:18:29.233 --> 01:18:31.025
I did good, right?

531
01:18:33.233 --> 01:18:34.942
You did good.

532
01:18:36.483 --> 01:18:38.567
Now let's go home.

533
01:18:49.067 --> 01:18:52.150
You're responsible
until the delivery,


534
01:18:52.775 --> 01:18:55.150
so it's your problem.

535
01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:57.733
I'm responsible,
leave them alone.


536
01:19:00.067 --> 01:19:04.192
They're my insurance
that you'll solve the problem.


537
01:19:04.442 --> 01:19:07.067
I'll give you 24 hours,

538
01:19:07.317 --> 01:19:10.400
before I kill them all.

539
01:19:10.650 --> 01:19:12.775
- It's not their fault.
- Shut up!


540
01:19:29.525 --> 01:19:32.442
Don't take it badly,
it's just business.


541
01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:42.233
I can't do it by myself,
I need someone.


542
01:19:44.983 --> 01:19:46.650
Just one.

543
01:19:48.358 --> 01:19:49.858
Bruno, get up.

544
01:19:53.275 --> 01:19:54.692
Let's go.

545
01:20:20.525 --> 01:20:22.608
Let's split up!

546
01:20:35.650 --> 01:20:37.817
We're screwed, Ciro.

547
01:20:38.608 --> 01:20:40.567
We're screwed!

548
01:20:42.608 --> 01:20:45.275
They're up our ass.

549
01:20:47.525 --> 01:20:49.275
Ciro! What the fuck
are you doing?


550
01:20:50.108 --> 01:20:51.400
Ciro!

551
01:21:00.775 --> 01:21:03.108
Help!

552
01:21:07.150 --> 01:21:09.692
Help!

553
01:21:13.358 --> 01:21:14.817
Help!

554
01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:26.108
Ciru...

555
01:21:26.358 --> 01:21:29.442
If you ask me,
this is a fucking dumb idea.


556
01:22:29.358 --> 01:22:31.150
You got balls coming here.

557
01:22:32.567 --> 01:22:34.192
What do you want?

558
01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:36.775
I could kill you now.

559
01:22:37.025 --> 01:22:39.567
The Russians know it was you.

560
01:22:39.817 --> 01:22:41.692
They're on their way.

561
01:22:44.942 --> 01:22:47.525
You've got a chance
to save yourself.


562
01:22:49.025 --> 01:22:50.400
It's me.

563
01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:55.275
You wanna be master
in your own home again?


564
01:22:55.525 --> 01:22:57.525
We gotta kill them all.

565
01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:06.733
Why should I trust you?

566
01:23:11.192 --> 01:23:13.692
Because now your war
is mine too.


567
01:23:45.067 --> 01:23:46.233
Ciru!

568
01:23:47.858 --> 01:23:50.983
What the fuck happened?
You're all wet.


569
01:23:51.233 --> 01:23:53.400
- What happened?
- You got no idea!


570
01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:56.608
- The cops were after us.
- Cops?


571
01:23:56.942 --> 01:23:59.275
- And?
- There was no way out.


572
01:23:59.525 --> 01:24:01.983
Bruno shouted: "We're screwed!"

573
01:24:02.233 --> 01:24:04.025
I jumped overboard.

574
01:24:04.275 --> 01:24:07.025
The water was freezing.
I felt like a penguin!


575
01:24:07.692 --> 01:24:09.108
I believe it.

576
01:24:10.192 --> 01:24:11.442
Dry yourself.

577
01:24:12.317 --> 01:24:15.900
The police boat stopped
and Bruno got away.


578
01:24:16.525 --> 01:24:17.983
And where's Bruno now?

579
01:24:18.233 --> 01:24:22.275
He'll be back any minute. Don't
worry, I'll stay here with you.


580
01:24:22.567 --> 01:24:24.442
You'll stay here with me?

581
01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:26.733
- Whatever happens to me?
- I'll always be here.


582
01:24:26.983 --> 01:24:29.525
Come here, let me dress you.

583
01:24:30.483 --> 01:24:32.900
And if business goes well,
I'll give you heaps of presents.


584
01:24:33.150 --> 01:24:34.400
What kind of presents?

585
01:24:34.692 --> 01:24:38.400
Necklaces, watches, motorbikes,
cars, whatever you like.


586
01:24:38.650 --> 01:24:39.650
And then?

587
01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:43.108
Me, you and Bruno will buy
a big house in Posillipo.


588
01:24:43.608 --> 01:24:45.192
- With a pool?
- Of course.


589
01:24:45.442 --> 01:24:47.775
So you can take
another dip, huh?


590
01:24:48.192 --> 01:24:49.733
In the pool!

591
01:24:51.025 --> 01:24:52.067
Bruno!

592
01:24:52.317 --> 01:24:55.233
Baby, what we did!
You were incredible, Ciru.


593
01:24:55.483 --> 01:24:57.692
Get my shoes, hurry.

594
01:24:58.692 --> 01:25:00.900
- How did you think of it?
- Just came to me.


595
01:25:01.150 --> 01:25:03.108
You saved me, Ciru.

596
01:25:04.150 --> 01:25:06.692
Fix him up good,
tonight he's in for a treat.


597
01:25:06.942 --> 01:25:08.900
- What's going on?
- We performed a miracle.


598
01:25:09.442 --> 01:25:11.108
Blackbird called us to the club.

599
01:25:11.233 --> 01:25:12.108
Really?

600
01:25:12.192 --> 01:25:13.858
- To the Red Bloom?
- Exactly.


601
01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:15.858
We're gonna make heaps of money.

602
01:25:15.983 --> 01:25:16.942
God willing!

603
01:25:17.025 --> 01:25:18.317
We will, I swear.

604
01:25:18.567 --> 01:25:21.442
Sure, where else
will he find a pair like us?


605
01:25:21.692 --> 01:25:24.025
You can say that again.
Let's go!


606
01:25:25.067 --> 01:25:26.900
You'll live like a queen.

607
01:25:27.233 --> 01:25:30.442
- Don't be late.
- Don't wait up for us.


608
01:26:16.150 --> 01:26:19.108
- Bruno! Wait here a minute.
- I'll be right here.


609
01:26:58.817 --> 01:27:00.025
Good evening.

610
01:27:00.275 --> 01:27:02.067
Who's he?

611
01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:04.233
He's my son.

612
01:27:05.025 --> 01:27:08.150
Are you the one who jumped
overboard to stop the cops?


613
01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.858
- Good boy! What's your name?
- Ciro.


614
01:27:11.108 --> 01:27:13.400
Good job,
Ciro come here to Uncle.


615
01:27:14.317 --> 01:27:16.567
Go get yourself an ice cream.

616
01:27:17.567 --> 01:27:20.275
Here. The kid's got balls.

617
01:27:21.817 --> 01:27:23.983
How the fuck did
such a smart kid


618
01:27:24.233 --> 01:27:26.275
grow up with such
a dickhead father?


619
01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.442
You do know that
I pay for the speedboat fuel?


620
01:27:30.858 --> 01:27:33.608
You cost me three times as much
as the others.


621
01:27:33.858 --> 01:27:36.358
Why the fuck do you have
to go so fast?


622
01:27:37.067 --> 01:27:39.817
It's the third time
you risked losing the load.


623
01:27:40.067 --> 01:27:42.025
Who the fuck
do you think you are?


624
01:27:42.275 --> 01:27:45.692
You do as I say or I'll kick
your ass outta here!


625
01:27:46.317 --> 01:27:49.275
He wants to call the shots.
Do things his way.


626
01:27:52.025 --> 01:27:54.442
This kid deserves better.

627
01:27:54.983 --> 01:27:56.733
And your girlfriend,
what's her name?


628
01:27:57.275 --> 01:27:59.025
Stella, am I right?

629
01:27:59.692 --> 01:28:03.233
Go back to Stella and change
your shirt, it's fuckin' ugly.


630
01:28:15.983 --> 01:28:18.317
I'm a good-for-nothing.

631
01:28:18.817 --> 01:28:21.608
I'm hopeless,
I shoulda spit in his face.


632
01:28:23.650 --> 01:28:26.775
He treated me like an asshole
in front of everybody.


633
01:28:27.025 --> 01:28:28.567
I'm hopeless.

634
01:28:29.025 --> 01:28:31.233
It's not true, you're the best.

635
01:28:31.817 --> 01:28:34.525
I wish I'd had
a father like you.


636
01:28:58.608 --> 01:28:59.983
Here.

637
01:29:05.067 --> 01:29:06.733
You ready?

638
01:29:07.567 --> 01:29:09.025
Let's go.

639
01:29:18.150 --> 01:29:21.817
- In Saint Anna we trust!
- Saint Anna!


640
01:29:22.067 --> 01:29:23.817
May the Holy Virgin be with us!

641
01:30:01.733 --> 01:30:04.858
- Where are you going?
- The right way.


642
01:30:05.192 --> 01:30:06.567
What does that mean?

643
01:30:06.817 --> 01:30:10.317
It means the time's come
to branch out on our own.


644
01:30:21.733 --> 01:30:23.400
Come, Bruno!

645
01:30:24.067 --> 01:30:25.858
Okay, perfect.

646
01:30:26.442 --> 01:30:27.942
Guys, come on!

647
01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.858
Go, go!

648
01:30:33.525 --> 01:30:34.817
Go!

649
01:30:35.067 --> 01:30:36.525
Come on, go!

650
01:30:36.775 --> 01:30:38.067
Quick!

651
01:30:41.025 --> 01:30:42.317
Go, go!

652
01:30:42.608 --> 01:30:44.400
Take two.

653
01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:48.400
- You gotta sell them tonight.
- Piece of cake.


654
01:30:48.650 --> 01:30:50.233
Ciru, come!

655
01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.275
But if Blackbird finds out,
he'll be pissed.


656
01:30:59.525 --> 01:31:01.233
I don't give a fuck
about Blackbird


657
01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:02.775
we work and he gets the money.

658
01:31:03.025 --> 01:31:05.525
The time's come to stick it
up his ass!


659
01:31:06.275 --> 01:31:08.817
Ciro, move it!
Are you asleep or what?


660
01:32:14.858 --> 01:32:16.942
Where are our husbands?

661
01:32:18.650 --> 01:32:21.025
What happened?
No one's answering.


662
01:32:23.567 --> 01:32:26.025
Go out and take the kids.

663
01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:41.192
Mama...

664
01:33:12.525 --> 01:33:14.650
Where's Virgilio?

665
01:33:15.900 --> 01:33:17.483
Where is he?

666
01:33:25.483 --> 01:33:27.400
Where's Virgilio?

667
01:33:35.192 --> 01:33:36.775
I'm sorry.

668
01:33:48.567 --> 01:33:50.733
I need your help.

669
01:33:57.317 --> 01:33:59.067
I need you.

670
01:34:05.733 --> 01:34:07.650
You have to do something for me.

671
01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:11.150
- Only you can help me.
- I looked for you all over.


672
01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.358
I was afraid something bad
had happened to you.


673
01:34:15.025 --> 01:34:16.650
Blackbird is pissed at you.

674
01:34:16.900 --> 01:34:19.567
I know, that's why I called you.

675
01:34:20.733 --> 01:34:23.108
We fucked up.

676
01:34:23.817 --> 01:34:26.608
Big time.
But we want to make up for it.


677
01:34:27.775 --> 01:34:29.775
And only you can help us.

678
01:34:30.025 --> 01:34:32.025
Me? How?

679
01:34:37.233 --> 01:34:40.650
Go to Blackbird, bring him here.
He trusts you.


680
01:34:40.900 --> 01:34:44.025
- Tell him we're sorry.
- We want to apologize.


681
01:34:45.150 --> 01:34:47.733
We made a mistake,
but we won't do it again.


682
01:34:49.275 --> 01:34:51.900
- Are you sure he'll understand?
- He'll understand.


683
01:34:52.692 --> 01:34:54.150
Of course he'll understand.

684
01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:56.733
By tonight,
it will all be cleared up


685
01:34:57.608 --> 01:35:00.150
and we'll go listen
to Stella sing.


686
01:35:01.108 --> 01:35:03.025
- Right, Nunzio?
- Sure.


687
01:35:03.983 --> 01:35:05.608
Trust me.

688
01:35:05.858 --> 01:35:07.025
Go.

689
01:35:07.942 --> 01:35:09.317
Go.

690
01:35:48.525 --> 01:35:50.150
You know, Bruno...

691
01:35:51.442 --> 01:35:53.775
I respect these people.

692
01:35:54.233 --> 01:35:57.025
They do what they do
for their country,


693
01:35:57.275 --> 01:35:59.108
for their families.

694
01:36:00.525 --> 01:36:03.442
I respect them, even though
I don't believe in all this.


695
01:36:05.317 --> 01:36:07.358
I learned that when I was a kid.

696
01:36:09.483 --> 01:36:12.358
People like us
are condemned to be alone.


697
01:36:19.025 --> 01:36:20.275
Let's go.

698
01:37:06.108 --> 01:37:08.192
You ready?

699
01:37:10.275 --> 01:37:11.317
Are you ready?

700
01:37:13.858 --> 01:37:15.233
Let's go.

701
01:38:07.942 --> 01:38:09.150
Bruno!

702
01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:26.983
Nunzio!

703
01:38:56.275 --> 01:38:58.442
Where are you taking us?

704
01:39:03.150 --> 01:39:05.358
I know it was you.

705
01:40:27.608 --> 01:40:29.025
Stella!

706
01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:25.233
I froze on the streets
for 30 years, for no reason.


707
01:41:25.483 --> 01:41:27.317
I deserved to go out on a high.

708
01:41:27.567 --> 01:41:31.108
You didn't even stop when
they got your people involved.


709
01:41:31.358 --> 01:41:34.817
- You killed Virgilio.
- I didn't want Virgilio to die.


710
01:41:35.067 --> 01:41:38.150
I wanted you to die!
You took my life.


711
01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:41.025
You became what I never was.

712
01:41:41.275 --> 01:41:43.900
Since you got here,
all I've thought of


713
01:41:44.233 --> 01:41:45.817
is how I can fuck you over.

714
01:41:46.525 --> 01:41:49.025
But I'm not
that little kid anymore.


715
01:41:49.733 --> 01:41:51.900
You'll never fuck me over again.

716
01:42:31.108 --> 01:42:32.608
Get out!

717
01:42:47.483 --> 01:42:49.692
How old would Stella be now?

718
01:42:51.525 --> 01:42:53.400
Do you remember
the voice she had?


719
01:42:54.692 --> 01:42:56.650
I've never forgotten it.

720
01:43:08.608 --> 01:43:10.567
What is it, are you scared?

721
01:43:12.233 --> 01:43:14.900
What? You taught me.

722
01:43:16.275 --> 01:43:18.275
In life you should never be
scared of anything


723
01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:19.608
not even dying.

724
01:43:22.608 --> 01:43:24.983
But you don't know
what that means.


725
01:43:25.567 --> 01:43:27.067
I do.

726
01:43:28.483 --> 01:43:30.525
Because I'm already dead.

727
01:44:24.358 --> 01:44:25.942
Kill me.

728
01:44:26.775 --> 01:44:28.275
Kill me now.

729
01:44:33.192 --> 01:44:35.650
Death is a gift
you don't deserve.


730
01:44:38.192 --> 01:44:41.442
For you there'll never be peace
or forgiveness on this earth.


731
01:44:45.067 --> 01:44:46.108
Now go.

732
01:44:50.150 --> 01:44:51.858
I said go.

733
01:45:13.942 --> 01:45:14.942
Why?

734
01:45:16.858 --> 01:45:19.525
Never leave your enemies alive.

735
01:45:22.525 --> 01:45:23.983
That's what I think, too.

736
01:45:36.983 --> 01:45:38.692
No boss.

737
01:46:20.483 --> 01:46:21.692
Hey, kid!

738
01:46:24.608 --> 01:46:26.233
Are you Ciro?

739
01:46:27.692 --> 01:46:29.817
- Yeah, I'm Ciro.
- Pleasure, Attilio.


740
01:46:30.067 --> 01:46:33.233
Now I'll take you to meet
Don Pietro Savastano,


741
01:46:33.483 --> 01:46:35.983
the first thing is manners,
got that?


742
01:46:36.233 --> 01:46:38.317
- Got it.
- Good, let's go.


743
01:47:19.108 --> 01:47:21.192
Ciro, this is for you.

744
01:47:22.692 --> 01:47:24.525
It's personal.

745
01:49:43.317 --> 01:49:48.817
THE IMMORTAL

746
01:49:52.892 --> 01:49:57.892
