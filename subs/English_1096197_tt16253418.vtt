I'll make sure he stays

- Oh, nothing, dear.


87

As you grow up, you're becoming
more like your mum.

- Yeah.
- My father is the governor.


102

Hey, he's got my vote.

I don't think I've heard that story.

Really?

109
00:08:18.763 --> 00:08:21.248
You've told me
a thousand times, Grandpa.

That's what I said.

113
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.808
You can't give up law school
to intern at a fucking start-up.


114
00:08:29.912 --> 00:08:31.914
- It's not a start-up.
- Dad's charity.

It'll be Fortune 500

You don't even like computers.

You really want to be stuck
in a job you hate?

<i>(Chuckles)</i>

160
00:10:25.683 --> 00:10:28.202
Thank you for finding Mr. Tibbs.

161
00:10:28.306 --> 00:10:29.549
No worries.

162
00:10:29.652 --> 00:10:30.619
I'll see you on the plane.

163
00:10:32.759 --> 00:10:35.244
Do you think I'm too old
to have a teddy?


164
00:10:35.347 --> 00:10:39.213
Hey, I'd want Mr. Tibbs with me
if I was in trouble.

You found a new admirer.
<i>(Chuckles)</i>


167
00:10:45.254 --> 00:10:48.947
I remember when you were that size.

<i>(Chuckles)</i>

169
00:10:50.535 --> 00:10:54.056
Ava, do you really need me in Cabo?

170
00:10:54.159 --> 00:10:56.161
You're a big girl now.

171
00:10:56.265 --> 00:10:58.060
That's true.

172
00:10:58.163 --> 00:11:00.372
But you've come all the way here.

173
00:11:00.476 --> 00:11:02.685
No worries. <i>(Chuckles)</i>

174
00:11:02.789 --> 00:11:04.722
Your dad pays me.

175
00:11:04.825 --> 00:11:08.967
It's just that I feel
kind of weird about today.


176
00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:13.316
Hey, you're gonna be okay
on this one.


177
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.973
I mean, you've got your friends.

178
00:11:15.077 --> 00:11:16.734
I don't think
they're gonna miss me.


179
00:11:16.837 --> 00:11:19.253
You're right, but after
what happened with Mom.


180
00:11:19.357 --> 00:11:21.186
- <i>(Sighs)</i>
- The accident.

<i>(Sighs)</i>

182
00:11:23.533 --> 00:11:26.226
I miss her, Ava.

183
00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:28.124
I really do.

184
00:11:28.228 --> 00:11:30.713
I still have nightmares
about it.


185
00:11:30.817 --> 00:11:33.060
- Wasn't your fault.
- <i>(Sighs)</i>


186
00:11:33.164 --> 00:11:35.269
Things would have been different
if I'd been there.


187
00:11:35.373 --> 00:11:37.237
She might never have drowned.

188
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:41.310
I know it sounds kooky, but
I just like having you around.


189
00:11:41.413 --> 00:11:44.140
Well, if you'd feel more
comfortable me coming,


190
00:11:44.244 --> 00:11:46.349
you just have to say.

191

Don't worry, I'll be discreet.

194
00:11:54.116 --> 00:11:56.601
Your pals will hardly know
I'm there.

Hello, sir.
Third on the right.

- Thanks.
- Ma'am.

- This way please.
- What's my surprise, Nana?


199
00:12:06.887 --> 00:12:09.614
- Wait till we sit down.
- Okay.


200
00:12:09.718 --> 00:12:11.305
On your right, about halfway down.

- <i>(Chuckles)</i>
- Well, he'sin for an adventure.

<i>(Laughter)</i>

203
00:12:18.278 --> 00:12:21.488
Aww, they look so happy.

204
00:12:21.591 --> 00:12:22.938
Wonder how long
they've been together.


205
00:12:23.041 --> 00:12:25.457
Before you were born,
that's for sure.


206
00:12:25.561 --> 00:12:26.838
- Yeah.
- Should be that way.


207
00:12:26.942 --> 00:12:28.391
- Hi.
- Hello.


208
00:12:28.495 --> 00:12:30.462
You'd have to get married now
to get to where they are.


209
00:12:30.566 --> 00:12:33.086
No way. I'm too young.

210
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:36.330
<i>(Chuckles)</i> When is not too young?

211
00:12:36.434 --> 00:12:37.746
Well...

212
00:12:37.849 --> 00:12:41.301
<i>(Both laugh)</i>

213
00:12:41.404 --> 00:12:44.442
- Ava, where you going?
We're not in coach.


214
00:12:44.545 --> 00:12:46.513
They said I could
sit at the back.


215
00:12:46.616 --> 00:12:49.274
- It's not a busy flight.
- Oh, okay.


216
00:12:49.378 --> 00:12:52.588
Wow. Babysitter is finally
letting you grow up.


217
00:12:52.692 --> 00:12:54.141
- Shh.
- What?


218
00:12:54.245 --> 00:12:56.385
Hmm.

<i>(Indistinct conversations)</i>

220
00:12:59.043 --> 00:13:02.598
Preppy motherfuckers.

221
00:13:02.702 --> 00:13:04.289
Sorry.

222
00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:11.745
Please fasten your seat belt.

223
00:13:11.849 --> 00:13:13.298
Insert the flat end and buckle.

224
00:13:13.402 --> 00:13:15.024
To tighten, pull on the loose
strap end and release.


225
00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:17.509
- Nice lateral raise.
- Shh, Kyle.


226
00:13:17.613 --> 00:13:19.615
- What?
- He's just doing his job.


227
00:13:19.719 --> 00:13:21.479
Yeah, I'm just--
I'm encouraging him.


228
00:13:21.582 --> 00:13:24.862
You're doing a great job.
It's very instructive.


229
00:13:24.965 --> 00:13:27.450
Looks good with a mask, too.

230
00:13:27.554 --> 00:13:29.901
Here comes the life jacket.

231
00:13:30.005 --> 00:13:31.765
Notice what he's doing
with the whistle.


232
00:13:31.869 --> 00:13:34.906
- <i>(Chuckles)</i>
- Ooh-hoo-hoo, that is so flirty.


233
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.426
- <i>(Laughs)</i>
- Oh, my God. Stop.


234
00:13:37.529 --> 00:13:39.186
Come on.
That's not an insult.


235
00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.188
That's a nice thing to say
about someone, I think.


236
00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:44.053
- I'm giving him a compliment.
- Stop it.


237
00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:45.227
What?

238

<i>(Engine roaring)</i>

I'm sorry about giving you
a hard time earlier.


240

- No worries.
- It's just...


241
00:13:59.586 --> 00:14:01.830
I know that you're amazing
at everything you do.


242
00:14:01.933 --> 00:14:03.763
- I am not.
- Yeah, you are.


243
00:14:03.866 --> 00:14:06.351
You're made to be
a pro bono lawyer,

helping people who need it.

245

You were born

Hey, I believe in you.

247
00:14:15.222 --> 00:14:16.810
So should you.

248
00:14:16.914 --> 00:14:18.916
That's cool.

249

I know you're just
looking out for me.

This year, Cabo... next year,
the Northern Lights, huh?

Um, maybe.

Guys, this trip is gonna be
a fuckin' blast.

Don't worry, man,

I'm sure he's used to
spending time on his knees.

- Shut up, Kyle.
- What? Right?

Well, if you love them so much,
why do you eat them?

They're only chocolates, silly.

Oh, you can't have sweeties
all the time.

It's so unhealthy.

Plenty of salads
if you're on holiday, Grandpa.

Yeah, yeah.
Don't want to take the risk.

It's 'cause it's so early.

you the options that we had.

That's what I keep telling her.

Uh, I don't know.

The seabed's not as solid
as Brandon thought.


712
00:42:40.547 --> 00:42:43.308
Should we try to swim out the hole?

00:42:43.411 --> 00:42:44.930
I don't think we have a choice.

We'll never get to the surface

who had scuba tanks and--
and-- and some other shit?


732
00:43:36.844 --> 00:43:38.397
I remember they-- they
checked in


733
00:43:38.501 --> 00:43:41.228
- this, like, puke-green bag.
- Yeah, somewhere in the hold


734
00:43:41.331 --> 00:43:43.679
- with all the other cases.
- Okay, I'm just trying


735
00:43:43.782 --> 00:43:45.404
to suggest something positive here.

736
00:43:45.508 --> 00:43:47.475
We can access the hold
through here.


737
00:43:47.579 --> 00:43:49.857
- There's a hatch.
- Great.


738
00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:51.445
Uh, so we have a good chance
of finding it, then.


739
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:55.069
But the scuba tanks are empty.
They-- They have to be.


740
00:43:55.173 --> 00:43:57.313
Otherwise, they wouldn't have
been allowed on the aircraft.

No. Come on. Um...

743

What about these little dudes, huh?

744
00:44:06.425 --> 00:44:07.737
They're... they're buzzing out air

745
00:44:07.841 --> 00:44:09.981
when you-- when you
pull on this string.


746
00:44:10.084 --> 00:44:13.018
Okay, so the tanks
are useless to us,

00:44:13.122 --> 00:44:15.469
but they'll have other gear, right?

748

If we're gonna get to the surface,

749
00:44:17.367 --> 00:44:19.059
we'll need masks and wet suits,

750
00:44:19.162 --> 00:44:21.302
and we could look
in the overhead lockers, too.

His scuba tank should

One, I'll give to Rosa.

we pull our life jacket cords.
