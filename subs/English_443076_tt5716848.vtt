00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:47.796
<i>Listen, la, la,</i>
<i>big city of dreams, baby.</i>


2
00:00:47.798 --> 00:00:49.898
<i>You got Hollywood,</i>
<i>bel air,</i>


3
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.302
<i>silicon beach,</i>
<i>and Beverly hills, right?</i>


4
00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:56.505
<i>Four of the wealthiest</i>
<i>neighborhoods in the country.</i>


5
00:00:56.507 --> 00:00:59.541
<i>And then...</i>

6
00:00:59.543 --> 00:01:00.742
<i>There's south central.</i>

7
00:01:00.744 --> 00:01:02.511
<i>Now be honest,</i>
<i>all right,</i>


8
00:01:02.513 --> 00:01:04.479
<i>when you hear the words</i>
<i>"south central,"</i>


9
00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.849
<i>what do you think,</i>
<i>gangs, drugs, guns?</i>


10
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:09.985
<i>Well, then,</i>
<i>what the hell</i>


11
00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:13.555
<i>are all these rich white people</i>
<i>doing here, hmm?!</i>


12
00:01:13.557 --> 00:01:17.859
<i>You see, six blocks from one</i>
<i>of the most expensive colleges</i>


13
00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:21.330
<i>in the country sits one</i>
<i>of the poorest neighborhoods</i>


14
00:01:21.332 --> 00:01:22.964
<i>in the country.</i>

15
00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:24.900
<i>And that's</i>
<i>where your boy grew up.</i>


16
00:01:24.902 --> 00:01:26.868
<i>We got a family business.</i>

17
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.504
<i>More emphasis</i>
<i>on "family" than "business."</i>


18
00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:32.007
<i>'Cause we always broke.</i>

19
00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.809
<i>20 years ago,</i>
<i>my dad and uncle</i>


20
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:35.844
<i>started this gym</i>
<i>to keep kids out of gangs</i>


21
00:01:35.846 --> 00:01:37.446
<i>and off the streets,</i>

22
00:01:37.448 --> 00:01:39.348
<i>give them</i>
<i>some positive role models.</i>


23
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.750
<i>Then they got locked up</i>
<i>for bank robbery.</i>


24
00:01:41.752 --> 00:01:44.453
<i>I believe</i>
<i>they call that irony.</i>


25
00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:47.489
<i>That left me and my moms</i>
<i>to run this place on our own.</i>


26
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:50.025
<i>She done a whole lot of good</i>
<i>for this community,</i>


27
00:01:50.027 --> 00:01:51.860
<i>but doing good don't really</i>
<i>pay the bills,</i>


28
00:01:51.862 --> 00:01:53.428
<i>you know what I'm saying,</i>

29
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.097
<i>and the bank's about</i>
<i>to shut us down.</i>


30
00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.566
<i>Over the years we kept</i>
<i>the doors open</i>


31
00:01:57.568 --> 00:01:59.000
<i>with endless side hustles,</i>

32
00:01:59.002 --> 00:02:01.036
<i>and that's where my boy</i>
<i>juice comes in.</i>


33
00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:03.739
<i>We've been best boys</i>
<i>since I was a little jit.</i>


34
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:05.907
<i>Now juice?</i>
<i>He the plug.</i>


35
00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.642
<i>You need anything,</i>
<i>he can get it.</i>


36
00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:10.112
<i>Just don't ask him how.</i>

37
00:02:11.715 --> 00:02:13.448
<i>Why you laughing?</i>
<i>Why you laughing?</i>


38
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.685
<i>But luckily</i>
<i>my girlfriend Alicia</i>


39
00:02:16.687 --> 00:02:18.987
<i>has always been there</i>
<i>to get us back on track.</i>


40
00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.923
<i>I mean, she don't know</i>
<i>she's my girlfriend</i> yet.


41
00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:25.560
<i>She got a serious crush on me.</i>
<i>Like, serious crush.</i>


42
00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:28.096
<i>She say she waiting</i>
<i>for a</i> real<i>man,</i>


43
00:02:28.098 --> 00:02:29.664
<i>but if that's not me,</i>

44
00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:31.666
<i>then why she been flirting</i>
<i>so hard?</i>


45
00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:33.468
<i>Look at her!</i>
<i>Look how she looking at me!</i>


46
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.571
<i>Zoom in.</i>
<i>Come on, you see that, right?</i>


47
00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:40.175
<i>So that's life in the hood.</i>

48
00:02:40.177 --> 00:02:42.577
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>we don't have much,</i>


49
00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.679
<i>but if I can keep</i>
<i>those gym doors open,</i>


50
00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:48.917
<i>I can keep my little family</i>
<i>together, and really,</i>


51
00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.753
<i>that's what it's all about.</i>

52
00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.022
<i>Nah! I'm just fucking with you.</i>

53
00:02:54.024 --> 00:02:56.191
<i>It's about</i>
<i>them dead presidents, y'all!</i>


54
00:02:56.193 --> 00:02:57.192
<i>Get it!</i>

55
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.200
I'm gonna kick your ass
so hard,


56
00:03:05.202 --> 00:03:07.836
you're gonna be able
to give yourself a rim job.


57
00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:10.105
You really wanna
go out like that?


58
00:03:10.107 --> 00:03:13.875
South central, baby.
Yeah, think about it.


59
00:03:13.877 --> 00:03:17.112
It's no game.
You in it right now.


60
00:03:17.114 --> 00:03:19.548
- Let's go.
- I'm crazy.


61
00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:25.554
I'm crazy! I'm crazy!

62
00:03:25.556 --> 00:03:28.156
You will die today!

63
00:03:28.158 --> 00:03:30.091
Now I apologize
for the language, y'all,


64
00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:31.827
but this is the kind
of tough talk


65
00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.762
you're gonna hear out
in these streets.


66
00:03:33.764 --> 00:03:35.864
Now of course I could teach
y'all how to fight.


67
00:03:35.866 --> 00:03:37.632
Give 'em a little one,
two, three, four.


68
00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.000
But what's that gonna solve?

69
00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:41.736
What I'm uniquely qualified
to teach y'all


70
00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:45.674
is that sometimes your best
weapons are your words.


71
00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:48.710
We're gonna put these down
and pick this up.


72
00:03:48.712 --> 00:03:50.946
Words?
This is the mma class.


73
00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:53.748
So stop being a little bitch
and let's fight.


74
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.619
Oh, okay, look at this guy.
Little hyped up.


75
00:03:57.621 --> 00:03:58.753
Tone it down a notch.

76
00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:02.991
That's great.
I see what you're doing.


77
00:04:02.993 --> 00:04:05.093
Nothing he says
can provoke me


78
00:04:05.095 --> 00:04:07.629
because I am de-escalating
the situation.


79
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:09.664
I never thought I'd get
this close to a vagina


80
00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:12.133
- until I was at least ten.
- <i>-What's a vagina?</i>


81
00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:14.736
Look, I'm gonna tell you
one time and one time only.


82
00:04:14.738 --> 00:04:18.673
You gonna sit your little ass
in that corner,


83
00:04:18.675 --> 00:04:20.909
and I'm gonna count to three.

84
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:22.077
- One.
- -<i>Three!</i>


85
00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:30.886
Whoo! Punched my dick!
Okay, listen!


86
00:04:30.888 --> 00:04:33.755
Oh!
What you--


87
00:04:33.757 --> 00:04:36.892
- time out, okay?!

88
00:04:36.894 --> 00:04:38.760
What's up?!
This is my class!


89
00:04:38.762 --> 00:04:41.530
I command y'all to sit down!
Sit down and listen to me!


90
00:04:41.532 --> 00:04:44.533
- What about with my deep voice?!
- Hey!


91
00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.605
Oh, that was an accident.
Y'all saw it was
an accident, right?


92
00:04:50.607 --> 00:04:52.240
You, you, you.
You look like you know cpr.


93
00:04:52.242 --> 00:04:54.142
Come on, white girl,
go ahead, do some magic.


94
00:04:54.144 --> 00:04:55.777
Go, go, go, check his pulse.

95
00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:57.312
What the heck
is going on here, del?


96
00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:04.052
Listen, y'all don't ruin
this for me.


97
00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.655
Just stay tight.
Hey, Alicia.


98
00:05:06.657 --> 00:05:09.891
We're just wrapping up
our session on de-escalation.


99
00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:11.560
He gonna be okay.

100
00:05:11.562 --> 00:05:14.195
And that is how not
to get into a fight.


101
00:05:14.197 --> 00:05:15.797
Oh, man! Whoo!

102
00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:17.832
Watch out for the kid
with the curly hair.


103
00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:20.201
-He is<i>mean.</i>
-It's not a joke, del.


104
00:05:20.203 --> 00:05:22.871
I ask you to watch my class
for ten minutes.


105
00:05:22.873 --> 00:05:24.873
He started it. Hey!

106
00:05:24.875 --> 00:05:27.676
That's the dumbest shit I've
heard from anyone all day,


107
00:05:27.678 --> 00:05:30.612
-and that includes juice.
-As promised, I got you a pair


108
00:05:30.614 --> 00:05:33.715
of refurbished Jordans, okay,
and according to the shoefax,


109
00:05:33.717 --> 00:05:35.884
I only got two people
wearing these shoes prior.


110
00:05:35.886 --> 00:05:38.353
You realize you're
the adult here, right?


111
00:05:38.355 --> 00:05:39.921
When you gonna start
acting like one?


112
00:05:39.923 --> 00:05:43.191
Del, quit trying to get
my staff pregnant


113
00:05:43.193 --> 00:05:45.260
and fix the damn air
conditioner!


114
00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:47.195
Ain't nobody trying
to get her pregnant, ma.


115
00:05:47.197 --> 00:05:49.264
-Mind your business.
-Just 'cause you fuckin' it up


116
00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:51.132
don't mean you ain't tryin'.

117
00:05:51.134 --> 00:05:53.001
Del, look at that thing.

118
00:05:53.003 --> 00:05:54.803
It's gonna fall
and kill somebody.


119
00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:56.271
You were gonna call
the repairman.


120
00:05:56.273 --> 00:05:58.206
-That's your fault, mama.
-Oh, a rep--


121
00:05:58.208 --> 00:06:00.275
you know what?
I'm trippin'.


122
00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:02.911
Let me dip into
this discretionary fund


123
00:06:02.913 --> 00:06:04.679
so I can pay for that shit.

124
00:06:04.681 --> 00:06:06.915
You cannot give your own son
the middle finger.


125
00:06:06.917 --> 00:06:09.150
Why not? I've already
tried the first two.


126
00:06:09.152 --> 00:06:11.252
One, del,
get yourself out of bed


127
00:06:11.254 --> 00:06:13.254
and go to school
before you flunk out.


128
00:06:13.256 --> 00:06:15.357
Two, I'm not
gonna tell you again,


129
00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:18.193
stop smoking weed
and playing video games.


130
00:06:18.195 --> 00:06:20.895
No results,
so I'm gonna try three


131
00:06:20.897 --> 00:06:22.897
and see what happens.

132
00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:26.868
When the phone
get turned back on?


133
00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.839
Dre's gym.
This is del speaking.


134
00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:34.175
<i>You have</i>
<i>a call from fulsom prison.</i>


135
00:06:34.177 --> 00:06:36.311
<i>This call is timed</i>
<i>and monitored.</i>


136
00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:40.181
Yo, yo, yo, del!
It's your pops.


137
00:06:40.183 --> 00:06:41.883
What you calling
here for, dad?


138
00:06:41.885 --> 00:06:43.885
Did you not just say
"this is dre's gym"?


139
00:06:43.887 --> 00:06:47.389
Who the fuck you think dre is?
It's me, nigga! It's me!


140
00:06:47.391 --> 00:06:50.291
<i>I can call</i>
<i>whenever the fuck I please!</i>


141
00:06:50.293 --> 00:06:53.728
Now, look, I know you
struggling and everything,


142
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.431
but, listen,
i might have a way to help you.


143
00:06:56.433 --> 00:06:58.299
We've been getting along
just fine my whole life


144
00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:00.135
<i>-without your help.</i>
-Look, I know, son--


145
00:07:00.137 --> 00:07:02.170
<i>you have one more minute.</i>

146
00:07:02.172 --> 00:07:05.407
<i>Fucking jail robot.</i>
<i>I ain't got time to be polite.</i>


147
00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:07.342
I know you are mad at me,
but listen,


148
00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.811
I care about you,
and I care about your mama,


149
00:07:09.813 --> 00:07:12.147
and I highly suggest if you
wanna keep that place open,


150
00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:14.749
you get your skinny ass
down here and see me


151
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:16.785
before it's motherfuckin'
too late.


152
00:07:25.828 --> 00:07:29.764
My boy!

153
00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:32.267
You done came to see
your old man, huh?


154
00:07:32.269 --> 00:07:34.069
Look, dad,
this is business, all right?


155
00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:35.804
Let's not pretend
it's anything else.


156
00:07:35.806 --> 00:07:37.272
You said you could help me.
I'm here to find out how.


157
00:07:37.274 --> 00:07:41.009
You know what?
You smart. Just like me.


158
00:07:41.011 --> 00:07:42.977
I'm nothing like you.

159
00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:45.080
Okay, now look, look, look.

160
00:07:45.082 --> 00:07:46.881
Now, I know i
wasn't in your life.


161
00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:49.884
All right? But I wanna
make it up to you.


162
00:07:49.886 --> 00:07:54.022
Okay? I wanna
make it up to you.


163
00:07:54.024 --> 00:07:56.391
-Ba-dow.
-That's a pretty small box


164
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.760
to contain
my entire childhood, dad.


165
00:07:58.762 --> 00:08:00.829
It's a gift
from my motherfuckin' heart.


166
00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.167
What is this?

167
00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:08.069
That's a Mr. potato head.

168
00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.337
-A what?
-Look at that.


169
00:08:09.339 --> 00:08:11.272
I knew you was
gonna love that.
Look at that.


170
00:08:11.274 --> 00:08:13.174
You got the little eyes
right here,


171
00:08:13.176 --> 00:08:15.076
then you got
the little nose.


172
00:08:15.078 --> 00:08:17.145
Got a little comb
for the mustache.


173
00:08:17.147 --> 00:08:18.413
This is some smart shit.

174
00:08:18.415 --> 00:08:20.115
This is gonna teach you
some shit.


175
00:08:20.117 --> 00:08:22.917
And he also got that,
just in case I got to lay


176
00:08:22.919 --> 00:08:26.421
a couple motherfuckers down
up in here.


177
00:08:26.423 --> 00:08:29.324
Look, dad, I'm an adult now.

178
00:08:29.326 --> 00:08:30.959
Oh, so you too old to learn?

179
00:08:30.961 --> 00:08:32.193
So I guess you
too old to learn


180
00:08:32.195 --> 00:08:34.329
how to solve your little
bank problem, huh?


181
00:08:34.331 --> 00:08:38.066
Look, what I meant to say
was this is great.


182
00:08:38.068 --> 00:08:39.934
-This is amazing.
-Yeah, it is.


183
00:08:39.936 --> 00:08:41.236
I'm gonna put it
right back in this box.


184
00:08:41.238 --> 00:08:42.771
You know what?
Come here.


185
00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:45.774
Come on. Come on.
Sit on daddy's lap.


186
00:08:45.776 --> 00:08:47.809
- You said what?
- On my lap, nigga.


187
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:50.011
- Sit down on my lap?
- On your lap?


188
00:08:50.013 --> 00:08:52.213
Yeah, get your ass
over here. Sit down.


189
00:08:52.215 --> 00:08:54.149
Right here.
Sit right here.


190
00:08:54.151 --> 00:08:56.251
I ain't gonna bite you, boy.
I'm your daddy.


191
00:08:56.253 --> 00:08:58.987
-Okay.
-But the tickle monster might.


192
00:08:58.989 --> 00:09:01.456
--See, this is what
I'm talking about.


193
00:09:01.458 --> 00:09:03.558
You remember that.
I used to tickle you
when you was little.


194
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.126
Don't act like ain't
nobody tickled you.


195
00:09:05.128 --> 00:09:07.529
When I was a kid!
I'm an adult now!


196
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:10.131
All right, I got a little out
of hand with the tickling.


197
00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:14.235
But I'm trying
to make up for 17 years
that I missed in your life.


198
00:09:14.237 --> 00:09:16.971
Now, listen, you know me
and your uncle Leon--


199
00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.274
come on--
me and your uncle Leon,


200
00:09:19.276 --> 00:09:22.010
we in here
for bank robbery.


201
00:09:22.012 --> 00:09:23.011
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.


202
00:09:23.013 --> 00:09:24.846
What you might not know

203
00:09:24.848 --> 00:09:28.082
is that the police
didn't find the money.


204
00:09:30.153 --> 00:09:33.388
I was planning on giving
that money to you and your mama


205
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.590
when I got out,
but your crazy-ass uncle Leon


206
00:09:35.592 --> 00:09:38.226
done fucked around and got out
a couple nights ago,


207
00:09:38.228 --> 00:09:40.228
so you gotta get out
and get that cash.


208
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.832
Wait.
How much money?


209
00:09:46.336 --> 00:09:48.570
A million dollars.

210
00:09:48.572 --> 00:09:52.874
And it's in this flop house
in the basement.


211
00:09:52.876 --> 00:09:54.075
The money's in the wall.

212
00:09:54.077 --> 00:09:58.046
Ooh-whee! Ooh!

213
00:09:58.048 --> 00:09:59.514
No.

214
00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:02.116
You just walked in here
and act like you didn't know


215
00:10:02.118 --> 00:10:04.352
that I was your daddy,
now you gonna come with that,


216
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:07.856
"ooh-whee!" Fake shit!

217
00:10:07.858 --> 00:10:08.990
Y-you--

218
00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.194
and all that shit!

219
00:10:13.196 --> 00:10:14.929
I'm sorry, I apologize.

220
00:10:14.931 --> 00:10:17.031
Now the only way
you gonna get that money


221
00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.000
is you gonna do
what I tell you to do.


222
00:10:19.002 --> 00:10:21.135
-And you know that that is?
-What's that?


223
00:10:21.137 --> 00:10:22.604
Let me read you
a bedtime story.


224
00:10:22.606 --> 00:10:25.073
-Come on, dad--
-you gonna-- shut the fuck up


225
00:10:25.075 --> 00:10:28.142
and let your daddy read you
a bedtime story, nigga.


226
00:10:28.144 --> 00:10:32.013
This is a book here
is called


227
00:10:32.015 --> 00:10:34.115
<i>the long red train.</i>

228
00:10:36.318 --> 00:10:41.589
Okay, "there is a new cookbook
in the cafeteria.


229
00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:44.292
Good morning,
little children students.


230
00:10:44.294 --> 00:10:46.127
We have
a brand-new cookbook."


231
00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:47.896
-Can you read it without--
-shut the fuck up.


232
00:10:47.898 --> 00:10:50.098
I'm gonna read it how
the fuck I wanna read it.


233
00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.332
-I'm your daddy.
-Okay.


234
00:10:51.334 --> 00:10:53.568
"I hope you like

235
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:57.605
the gourmet feast
that I made."


236
00:10:57.607 --> 00:11:00.541
<i>We get to the flop house,</i>
<i>we go to the basement,</i>


237
00:11:00.543 --> 00:11:03.344
<i>we get the money, our lives</i>
<i>are set, yo, I'm telling you!</i>


238
00:11:03.346 --> 00:11:06.014
-We gonna be rich, man!
-No,<i>I'm</i> gonna be rich.


239
00:11:06.016 --> 00:11:09.183
Ya'll get 5% each, depending
on how much work you put in.


240
00:11:09.185 --> 00:11:13.321
What the hell?
What has happened to the ghetto?


241
00:11:13.323 --> 00:11:15.156
Chipotle got a valet?

242
00:11:15.158 --> 00:11:17.659
<i>Come on,</i>
<i>it's the next street up.</i>


243
00:11:17.661 --> 00:11:19.594
But how does chipotle
got a valet?


244
00:11:19.596 --> 00:11:23.031
They done put a coffee bean
where they shot your man.


245
00:11:26.468 --> 00:11:30.705
Shit! They turned the flop house
into a frat house.


246
00:11:30.707 --> 00:11:32.006
What are we gonna do?

247
00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:38.313
We get a drill, huh?

248
00:11:38.315 --> 00:11:41.449
The same drills
that they dig
the subways with.


249
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:44.719
We dig straight
to the basement
El chapo style.


250
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:46.554
Right?
Then we grab the loot.


251
00:11:46.556 --> 00:11:48.990
That's the plot
from<i>ocean's 13.</i>


252
00:11:48.992 --> 00:11:51.426
You right, scratch that.
I say we go in
with 17 monkeys.


253
00:11:51.428 --> 00:11:53.695
-And a horse.
-That's<i>planet of the apes,</i>
man.


254
00:11:53.697 --> 00:11:56.698
- So you seen it.
- You got problems.


255
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.133
Like, I worry about you
sometimes, juice.


256
00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:01.035
Okay, all right,
all right, del!


257
00:12:01.037 --> 00:12:04.305
We get crank and dede.
That's<i>Friday.</i>


258
00:12:10.112 --> 00:12:13.381
I had a feeling
you'd be up here.


259
00:12:13.383 --> 00:12:15.750
-Hey.
-What, you're not
gonna hit me, right?


260
00:12:15.752 --> 00:12:18.052
Mmm...

261
00:12:18.054 --> 00:12:22.090
So what are you doing
in my thinking spot?


262
00:12:22.092 --> 00:12:23.324
Thinking.

263
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:28.229
What do you come up here
think about?


264
00:12:28.231 --> 00:12:31.265
Honestly, thinking about
what I'd do with the money.


265
00:12:31.267 --> 00:12:33.501
Hmm. Let me do
your shopping list for you.


266
00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:36.604
-One, sneakers, two, weed.
-Ohh...


267
00:12:36.606 --> 00:12:38.239
That's two things.
That's it.


268
00:12:38.241 --> 00:12:40.308
You really think
that's what I would do?


269
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.210
Give me a reason not to.

270
00:12:42.212 --> 00:12:45.279
Okay, listen, honestly,

271
00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:46.781
I'm not doing this
for myself, okay?


272
00:12:46.783 --> 00:12:50.585
I'm doing it for my mom.
This place is like her life.


273
00:12:50.587 --> 00:12:54.288
If I don't do something big,
then she could lose it all.


274
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:55.790
If you care so much about her,

275
00:12:55.792 --> 00:12:59.260
why don't you ever do
the little things she asks?


276
00:12:59.262 --> 00:13:02.030
The rats?
The showers?


277
00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:06.768
That ac unit she's been
on your ass about
every single day?


278
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.338
If I get that money soon,
none of that even matters.


279
00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.041
I can make this place
really special.


280
00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:15.610
And if I got some money
left over, yeah,


281
00:13:15.612 --> 00:13:18.146
I'm gonna budget in
some kicks and weed.


282
00:13:18.148 --> 00:13:20.748
You thought
i was gonna leave that out?


283
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.383
-No, I didn't.
-Okay, good.


284
00:13:22.385 --> 00:13:24.652
'Cause I got some right here.
You wanna smoke it?


285
00:13:24.654 --> 00:13:26.287
-What is that?
-It's some weed.


286
00:13:26.289 --> 00:13:28.389
It's a little, bitty weed.
You can barely see it.


287
00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:31.225
Look.

288
00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:32.527
What is wrong with you?

289
00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:36.697
So what'd you come out here
to think about?


290
00:13:36.699 --> 00:13:39.200
I'm trying to figure out
how we're going get into


291
00:13:39.202 --> 00:13:41.402
that damn frat house
in the first place.


292
00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:44.172
Don't worry.

293
00:13:44.174 --> 00:13:45.840
I got a couple ideas.

294
00:13:45.842 --> 00:13:48.342
Oh, no.

295
00:13:57.786 --> 00:14:00.688
Hello, sir, deputy fire Marshall
frank mckasky.


296
00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.423
Do you have the ds-367
certification


297
00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:04.158
on your fire-inspection
certificate?


298
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.462
You need a certification
on your certificate?


299
00:14:07.464 --> 00:14:08.863
Move out of my way.

300
00:14:08.865 --> 00:14:11.332
Do you know
how flammable these are?!


301
00:14:11.334 --> 00:14:15.136
I smell smoke.

302
00:14:15.138 --> 00:14:18.239
I see what's going on here.

303
00:14:18.241 --> 00:14:20.775
Took the batteries
out the smoke detector,


304
00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:22.610
let the place burn down,
collect the insurance money.


305
00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:24.412
Not on my watch.
Not on my watch!


306
00:14:24.414 --> 00:14:26.280
-Yo, agh!
-Not on my watch!


307
00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:29.250
Are you kidding me?!

308
00:14:29.252 --> 00:14:31.686
Anybody here read the news?
Hmm? Of course not.


309
00:14:31.688 --> 00:14:33.588
I'm surprised the lithium
battery on this thing


310
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:34.822
hasn't exploded yet.

311
00:14:34.824 --> 00:14:37.125
This place is
a lot worse than I thought.


312
00:14:37.127 --> 00:14:39.727
Somebody needs to take me
down to the basement right now!


313
00:14:39.729 --> 00:14:41.596
Yo, what the hell
is going on?


314
00:14:41.598 --> 00:14:43.664
Fire inspection.
I need you to take me down


315
00:14:43.666 --> 00:14:46.200
to the basement right now,
check the foundation.


316
00:14:46.202 --> 00:14:48.202
Yo, we had a fire inspection
a week ago, dog.


317
00:14:48.204 --> 00:14:51.305
And you're lucky we didn't
shut you down then...


318
00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:55.409
Dog.

319
00:14:55.411 --> 00:14:58.446
If you're a fire inspector,
why does your little badge


320
00:14:58.448 --> 00:15:00.882
say<i>"guardia de seguridad"?</i>

321
00:15:00.884 --> 00:15:05.219
Budget cuts, motherfucker.
You know what?


322
00:15:05.221 --> 00:15:08.222
I'm gonna go ahead and get
the fuck up out of here.


323
00:15:08.224 --> 00:15:09.757
I'm confiscating this.

324
00:15:09.759 --> 00:15:11.726
You, the fraternity letters,
that says "kox."


325
00:15:11.728 --> 00:15:13.594
You might wanna change that.

326
00:15:17.599 --> 00:15:20.368
We just letting anyone
in the house now, huh?


327
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.402
That's my fault, man.

328
00:15:21.404 --> 00:15:23.404
Think he took
your hoverboard.


329
00:15:23.406 --> 00:15:25.806
Fuck.

330
00:15:30.579 --> 00:15:32.647
<i>I got it.</i>

331
00:15:32.649 --> 00:15:34.415
We rush the frat, bam.

332
00:15:34.417 --> 00:15:36.417
Yep, that's what
I'm talking 'bout.


333
00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:41.289
We get strapped, we get mean,
and we rush that motherfucker!


334
00:15:41.291 --> 00:15:43.558
Excuse my friend,
ya'll, I'm sorry.


335
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.226
He's on drugs.

336
00:15:45.228 --> 00:15:47.428
No, no, no,
i mean rush the frat.


337
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:48.829
It's rush week.

338
00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:51.265
I'm gonna get in
by joining the fraternity.


339
00:15:51.267 --> 00:15:53.367
That's what I'm talking about.
Keep it simple.


340
00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:55.503
You're not a student.

341
00:15:55.505 --> 00:15:57.505
-Juice.
-On it.


342
00:15:57.507 --> 00:15:58.973
Got a guy that's gonna make
a fake ID


343
00:15:58.975 --> 00:16:01.642
in a perfect name to fit
in the fraternity scene.


344
00:16:01.644 --> 00:16:02.944
-Mm-hmm.
-Bam.


345
00:16:02.946 --> 00:16:04.912
But all those bros
have already seen your face.


346
00:16:04.914 --> 00:16:06.814
You think they're not gonna
call you out on that?


347
00:16:06.816 --> 00:16:09.450
-
-What's so funny?

348
00:16:09.452 --> 00:16:11.319
-She don't know!
-She don't know.


349
00:16:11.321 --> 00:16:13.688
-She's light-skinned.
-She don't know!


350
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.723
-What? What?
-Alicia, Alicia.


351
00:16:15.725 --> 00:16:17.692
You know so little
about white people.


352
00:16:17.694 --> 00:16:20.761
-So little.
-They are terrified
of being called racist.


353
00:16:20.763 --> 00:16:22.763
If a white guy sees
a brother they seen before,


354
00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:24.365
they're not gonna be like,
"oh, my god!


355
00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:28.336
Antoine? I-is that you?"
Because they don't want to look


356
00:16:28.338 --> 00:16:29.537
like some good ol' boy

357
00:16:29.539 --> 00:16:31.005
that thinks all brothers
look the same.


358
00:16:31.007 --> 00:16:33.808
But how are you so sure they
want you in the first place?


359
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.311
See, these days,
they need at least one token.


360
00:16:37.313 --> 00:16:38.946
-One.
-You think you're gonna be


361
00:16:38.948 --> 00:16:40.815
the only minority
trying to get in?


362
00:16:40.817 --> 00:16:42.817
What are you gonna do
about your competition?


363
00:16:42.819 --> 00:16:45.253
-Let me show.
-Okay, you ready?


364
00:16:45.255 --> 00:16:46.587
You ready?
Do it, do it.


365
00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:48.823
-Action
-charm.


366
00:16:48.825 --> 00:16:51.926
-No, that's not charm.
-That's not what we rehearsed.


367
00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:54.295
All right, you say "action."
I'll do it then.


368
00:16:54.297 --> 00:16:55.730
-Say action.
-I'm not saying "action."


369
00:16:55.732 --> 00:16:58.499
- Charmed.

370
00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:11.479
Greetings, gentlemen,
I'm here to rush.


371
00:17:15.317 --> 00:17:16.450
Name?

372
00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:18.319
Ah.

373
00:17:19.454 --> 00:17:22.490
Chet buttersworth?

374
00:17:22.492 --> 00:17:23.991
That's my name.

375
00:17:23.993 --> 00:17:26.594
Head on in.

376
00:17:26.596 --> 00:17:28.329
<i>Next generation,</i>
<i>deep space nine...</i>


377
00:17:28.331 --> 00:17:30.931
No, that's an off-shore equity
hedge account, bro.


378
00:17:30.933 --> 00:17:33.000
On there?

379
00:17:33.002 --> 00:17:35.803
It's got several advantages
over javascript.


380
00:17:35.805 --> 00:17:38.873
Nice to meet you.
Chet buttersworth.


381
00:17:38.875 --> 00:17:41.475
Listen, don't you guys
find it a little odd


382
00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:43.744
that they have
the white people over there


383
00:17:43.746 --> 00:17:47.982
and... other people
right here?


384
00:17:47.984 --> 00:17:49.717
We just sort of congregated
here by chance.


385
00:17:49.719 --> 00:17:51.619
Chance, that's funny.
What's your name?


386
00:17:51.621 --> 00:17:52.720
-Zack.
-Zack.


387
00:17:52.722 --> 00:17:54.522
Kind of tall for an Asian...

388
00:17:54.524 --> 00:17:55.790
6is what they're saying.

389
00:17:55.792 --> 00:17:57.491
Me? I'm like,
"he's a human being."


390
00:17:57.493 --> 00:17:59.894
You guys know about the theme
parties they had last year?


391
00:17:59.896 --> 00:18:03.798
No? Okay, just to name a few,
"no-fly list."


392
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.566
"I've been working
on the railroad."


393
00:18:05.568 --> 00:18:07.802
They want you to build a wall
outside, right outside the frat.


394
00:18:07.804 --> 00:18:09.770
They're like, "he doesn't even
speak English."


395
00:18:09.772 --> 00:18:13.474
I'm like, "he<i>does</i>
speak English," right?


396
00:18:13.476 --> 00:18:15.876
Okay, guys, you could be
a part of the problem,


397
00:18:15.878 --> 00:18:18.512
or you can be a part
of the revolution, yeah?


398
00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:20.781
What do you guys say
we all come together?


399
00:18:20.783 --> 00:18:23.417
Make it really explosive--
no pun intended--


400
00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:26.420
We're not gonna put up
with any racist bullshit.


401
00:18:26.422 --> 00:18:28.022
We're gonna
take back the night.


402
00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.857
Take back the night's
a women's movement.


403
00:18:29.859 --> 00:18:31.959
Don't kill my momentum.
I'm on a roll right now.


404
00:18:31.961 --> 00:18:36.664
Guys, new slogan just for you.
"Token is broken," cool?


405
00:18:36.666 --> 00:18:39.467
Token is broken.
Token is broken.


406
00:18:39.469 --> 00:18:42.603
Token is broken, march!
Token is broken, yeah!


407
00:18:42.605 --> 00:18:44.839
Token is broken!
Come on, black lead the pack!


408
00:18:44.841 --> 00:18:46.374
The Asian trailblazin'!

409
00:18:46.376 --> 00:18:49.643
Whoever you are,
<i>en espaŁol! Andale!</i>


410
00:18:49.645 --> 00:18:52.079
Token is broken.
Token is broken.


411
00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:54.615
<i>Token is broken.</i>
<i>Token is broken.</i>


412
00:18:54.617 --> 00:18:57.017
Thank god
they're gone, right?


413
00:18:57.019 --> 00:18:59.453
Don't worry, fellas,
I'm one of the good ones.


414
00:18:59.455 --> 00:19:01.922
You know, I would say that
I'm slightly overqualified


415
00:19:01.924 --> 00:19:04.658
for your organization,
but I play golf.


416
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:08.462
So, I mean,
you know, that's cool,
got a hole in one.


417
00:19:08.464 --> 00:19:10.831
-I'm into Polo, both kinds.
- Mm-hmm.


418
00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:12.800
Ultimate frisbee.
As I call it, ultimate frizz.


419
00:19:12.802 --> 00:19:14.769
I was a captain of that
for four years straight.


420
00:19:14.771 --> 00:19:18.439
Turned down hale.
That's Harvard and Yale.


421
00:19:18.441 --> 00:19:22.877
So what do you think?
Pretty good group this year.


422
00:19:22.879 --> 00:19:26.580
Yo, I think I know that guy.

423
00:19:26.582 --> 00:19:28.082
Didn't he, like,
come through here


424
00:19:28.084 --> 00:19:30.584
trying to pretend
to be a fire inspector
or some shit?


425
00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:32.586
Which g--

426
00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:35.122
oh, come on man,
that's not okay.


427
00:19:35.124 --> 00:19:37.892
You're basically
saying that all


428
00:19:37.894 --> 00:19:40.060
black people
look the same to you.


429
00:19:40.062 --> 00:19:42.663
That's like
the litmus test for racism.


430
00:19:42.665 --> 00:19:44.198
Wha-- I'm not
saying that, man.


431
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.133
I'm saying that's the same
black person


432
00:19:46.135 --> 00:19:48.102
who came through here
and stole Eddie's hoverboard.


433
00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:49.970
Oh, and now
he's a thief, hmm?


434
00:19:49.972 --> 00:19:51.572
Will you listen to me, man?

435
00:19:51.574 --> 00:19:53.774
I'm the least racist nigga
you know!


436
00:19:59.916 --> 00:20:03.150
That was out of context, fam.

437
00:20:04.786 --> 00:20:07.054
Like you never
said it, Roger!


438
00:20:08.824 --> 00:20:10.958
What are you thinking?

439
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.494
Fraternities get sued over this
kind of stuff all the time.


440
00:20:13.496 --> 00:20:16.730
Sued for what, man?
He ain't got no damages.


441
00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:18.966
You know me.
How could I hate black people?


442
00:20:18.968 --> 00:20:21.669
-I ride the bus.
-Oh, my god.


443
00:20:21.671 --> 00:20:23.137
Don't talk near him.

444
00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:25.539
You're missing the point, man.
That guy's up to something.


445
00:20:25.541 --> 00:20:28.242
So you give him a bid
if you want, that's cool.


446
00:20:28.244 --> 00:20:30.177
But I'm gonna find out
what it is.


447
00:20:30.179 --> 00:20:34.181
Just stop saying the--
the "n" word.


448
00:20:35.951 --> 00:20:38.018
<i>What are you doing?</i>

449
00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:39.253
I've been working
on my signature move.


450
00:20:39.255 --> 00:20:42.756
From the ropes?
What is this? Ufc or wwe?


451
00:20:42.758 --> 00:20:44.258
- Are you ready?
- Uh, yeah.


452
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.594
Really? Because the last time
you stepped in this ring,


453
00:20:46.596 --> 00:20:48.929
you got your ass handed to you
by a bunch of little kids.


454
00:20:48.931 --> 00:20:52.666
Ooh, with all due respect,
you're like half my weight.


455
00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:54.802
Come on,
buy me dinner first!


456
00:20:56.939 --> 00:20:59.874
Oh! Wait, is this supposed
to hurt or feel good?


457
00:20:59.876 --> 00:21:01.675
Like, what are we--
okay, okay, okay.


458
00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:03.277
-Say uncle.
-You love me?


459
00:21:03.279 --> 00:21:05.646
You said you love me?
I can't hear.


460
00:21:05.648 --> 00:21:08.516
<i>Goddamn it, del, if you</i>
<i>really wanna please a woman,</i>


461
00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:13.120
why don't you please me
and fix the fucking ac unit?


462
00:21:13.122 --> 00:21:16.690
All right, ma.
Show me that move one more time.


463
00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:19.159
I'm not gonna ask
you again, del!


464
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:23.230
So you got rid
of your competition.


465
00:21:23.232 --> 00:21:25.799
Sounds like you impressed 'em.
What happens now?


466
00:21:25.801 --> 00:21:28.168
Now all we can do is wait
and hope that my good looks


467
00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.738
and charm along with their
white guilt and fear of lawsuits


468
00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.673
is enough to get me in.

469
00:21:32.675 --> 00:21:34.575
All right, come on,
one, two.


470
00:21:34.577 --> 00:21:38.178
<i>Yo, I can't believe</i>
<i>we're giving this guy a bid.</i>


471
00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.649
Are you guys sure this is it?
Most freshman live in the dorms.


472
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:43.250
I told you there was
something about this guy.


473
00:21:43.252 --> 00:21:45.786
-So it's off-campus.
-Off-campus?!


474
00:21:45.788 --> 00:21:47.154
This is the ghetto, man.

475
00:21:47.156 --> 00:21:49.590
Technically,
we also live in the ghetto.


476
00:21:49.592 --> 00:21:50.991
True, but that's
the good ghetto.


477
00:21:50.993 --> 00:21:52.293
This is like
the ghetto-ghetto.


478
00:21:52.295 --> 00:21:54.161
Wow, and I thought
you didn't have


479
00:21:54.163 --> 00:21:56.730
- a problem with black people.
- Oh, you c--


480
00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:59.333
that's not fair, all right?

481
00:21:59.335 --> 00:22:02.570
I am drawing
an economic distinction,
not a racial one.


482
00:22:02.572 --> 00:22:05.172
Granted, but given
the racially charged history


483
00:22:05.174 --> 00:22:07.575
of this country,
can we really separate--


484
00:22:07.577 --> 00:22:08.709
guys. Hey!

485
00:22:08.711 --> 00:22:11.145
Enough!!

486
00:22:11.147 --> 00:22:13.247
Let's all just agree
it's super confusing


487
00:22:13.249 --> 00:22:16.750
being a white male
in today's society, okay?


488
00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:19.219
Now... hoods up.

489
00:22:19.221 --> 00:22:21.088
Oh, yeah.

490
00:22:24.326 --> 00:22:27.127
Kappa Alpha chi or die!
Kappa Alpha chi or die!


491
00:22:27.129 --> 00:22:28.929
Kappa Alpha chi or die!

492
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:31.899
Let's go!!
Let's go!!


493
00:22:32.969 --> 00:22:35.235
Watching this movie
last night


494
00:22:35.237 --> 00:22:37.905
made me mad
as a motherfucker.


495
00:22:37.907 --> 00:22:39.740
Y'all have seen<i>amistad?</i>

496
00:22:39.742 --> 00:22:41.108
Mm-hmm.

497
00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:43.978
All right.
Shit was crazy.


498
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.914
<i>Yo, check this out.</i>

499
00:22:46.916 --> 00:22:48.649
What the fuck?

500
00:23:05.401 --> 00:23:07.167
Watch these niggas.

501
00:23:07.169 --> 00:23:09.169
- Man, where is this shit?
- Can't get anything.


502
00:23:09.171 --> 00:23:10.704
It's like the Internet
stops at this neighborhood.


503
00:23:10.706 --> 00:23:12.406
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>you wrote it down right?</i>


504
00:23:12.408 --> 00:23:14.875
Yeah, the address he gave us
was for that gym back there.


505
00:23:14.877 --> 00:23:16.677
Yo, I told you
he was playing us.


506
00:23:16.679 --> 00:23:19.647
No, don't jump to conclusions.
Let's just ask somebody, okay?


507
00:23:19.649 --> 00:23:23.684
Oh, these guys look like
they know the lay of the land.


508
00:23:23.686 --> 00:23:27.221
Hey! Agh!

509
00:23:27.223 --> 00:23:29.790
Evening, fellas.
Oh, gotta get low.


510
00:23:29.792 --> 00:23:31.825
Low rider.

511
00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:34.962
Uh, we think we might be
a little bit lost here.


512
00:23:34.964 --> 00:23:37.297
I'd say so.

513
00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:40.968
Right? Wondering if you might
be able to help us out, though.


514
00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.303
I think we might have
gotten the wrong address.


515
00:23:43.305 --> 00:23:46.006
We're looking
for a fella by the name
of Chet buttersworth?


516
00:23:46.008 --> 00:23:48.208
African
-American gentlemen.

517
00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.244
Not that that means you would
necessarily know him,


518
00:23:50.246 --> 00:23:52.379
but not that it doesn't,
you know?


519
00:23:52.381 --> 00:23:55.082
Skin tone is sort of
right in between


520
00:23:55.084 --> 00:23:57.351
you in the front
and you in the back.


521
00:23:57.353 --> 00:23:59.920
Although with the shadows,
i can't totally tell.


522
00:23:59.922 --> 00:24:02.022
Um, what else,
what else, what else?


523
00:24:02.024 --> 00:24:03.857
Uh, well,
we're here to kidnap him


524
00:24:03.859 --> 00:24:06.126
as part of
our initiation ritual.


525
00:24:12.268 --> 00:24:14.268
Get the fuck out the 'hood,
cracker!


526
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.137
Run! Hey, hey, hey!
Everybody's running!


527
00:24:21.777 --> 00:24:25.112
Bam, okay, here we go.
Time to dance.


528
00:24:25.114 --> 00:24:27.347
No, I'm working, stop.

529
00:24:27.349 --> 00:24:28.882
The work can wait.

530
00:24:28.884 --> 00:24:31.785
It is time to play!

531
00:24:31.787 --> 00:24:35.122
You're gonna get me fired.
You're gonna get me fired.


532
00:24:35.124 --> 00:24:36.924
I know the owner.
You good.


533
00:24:36.926 --> 00:24:38.192
-Look at you.
-Stop. Don't.


534
00:24:38.194 --> 00:24:40.761
Play, play, play, play.
And...


535
00:24:40.763 --> 00:24:42.930
Out of the chair she goes.

536
00:24:42.932 --> 00:24:45.265
And around and around
she goes.


537
00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:47.468
Now I'm gonna teach you
some dance moves.


538
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.003
<i>You're not taking it serious.</i>
<i>Start with the right.</i>


539
00:24:50.005 --> 00:24:52.773
You're gonna fall in love.
Look back there.


540
00:24:52.775 --> 00:24:55.042
-Look back at it.
Look back at it.
-I don't want to.


541
00:24:55.044 --> 00:24:57.211
<i>Is this what they</i>
<i>do in the club?</i>


542
00:24:57.213 --> 00:25:02.015
Let me see what you got.
Oh, yes! Look at you.


543
00:25:02.017 --> 00:25:03.984
<i>Now for my closer,</i>
<i>this is what I do.</i>


544
00:25:03.986 --> 00:25:08.122
One, two, three, four,
spin and grab.


545
00:25:08.124 --> 00:25:09.490
Hey!

546
00:25:12.094 --> 00:25:14.361
<i>-Let's go!</i>
<i>-I just wanna check.</i>


547
00:25:14.363 --> 00:25:16.230
<i>'Cause there's almost</i>
<i>certainly a pit bull.</i>


548
00:25:16.232 --> 00:25:17.965
<i>Who the hell is that?</i>

549
00:25:17.967 --> 00:25:19.399
<i>I got a pretty good idea.</i>

550
00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:22.970
Wait here and don't get seen.
I will be right back.


551
00:25:22.972 --> 00:25:26.006
-That's not a house.
-I don't think any
of these are houses.


552
00:25:26.008 --> 00:25:27.941
- I just wanna kidnap somebody!

553
00:25:27.943 --> 00:25:29.910
Hey.
Can I help you gentlemen?


554
00:25:29.912 --> 00:25:31.845
Hey, Chet, how are you?

555
00:25:31.847 --> 00:25:34.882
What's up, man?
You live here?


556
00:25:34.884 --> 00:25:39.319
I volunteer here.
Why you guys wearing klan robes?


557
00:25:39.321 --> 00:25:41.021
- No, no, no.

558
00:25:41.023 --> 00:25:43.323
No, see, our hoods are rounder.
They're not pointy.


559
00:25:43.325 --> 00:25:46.326
-This is eggshell.
-It's a different
shade of white.


560
00:25:46.328 --> 00:25:49.163
-Totally different.
-Totally different.


561
00:25:49.165 --> 00:25:51.231
And besides, you know,
our fraternity


562
00:25:51.233 --> 00:25:53.934
actually pre-dates the klan
by over a decade,


563
00:25:53.936 --> 00:25:57.304
so the real question is
why are they wearing<i>our</i> robes?


564
00:25:57.306 --> 00:25:59.807
You know?
Why are they wearing<i>our</i> robes?


565
00:26:02.477 --> 00:26:04.478
Yeah,
y'all wearing klan robes.


566
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.480
Okay, well,
agree to disagree.


567
00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:09.483
And, shifting gears,
congratulations!


568
00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:11.418
We're here because
kappa Alpha chi


569
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.086
is officially
giving you a bid.


570
00:26:13.088 --> 00:26:15.055
We're here to kidnap you
for initiation.


571
00:26:15.057 --> 00:26:20.227
But, first,
quick order of business here.


572
00:26:20.229 --> 00:26:22.563
The university requires us
to get your signature


573
00:26:22.565 --> 00:26:24.398
on this consent form,
basically just says


574
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.999
that you're
comfortable with us


575
00:26:26.001 --> 00:26:28.168
physically abducting you
for the initiation.


576
00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:30.370
-Sign there.
-Okay, cool.


577
00:26:30.372 --> 00:26:32.372
And then initial here
for the robe.


578
00:26:32.374 --> 00:26:34.174
-Mm-hmm.
-Great, thank you.


579
00:26:34.176 --> 00:26:35.342
And then down here

580
00:26:35.344 --> 00:26:37.444
for the simulated
kidnapping language.


581
00:26:37.446 --> 00:26:40.013
-Sure.
-Which will be harsh.


582
00:26:40.015 --> 00:26:41.548
-There we go.
-Perfect.


583
00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.283
-Let's do this!
-Put this on.


584
00:26:43.285 --> 00:26:44.551
Whoa, o--

585
00:26:44.553 --> 00:26:46.920
-you gotta-
-where's that--


586
00:26:46.922 --> 00:26:48.622
-the head is right there.
-Give me your arm.


587
00:26:48.624 --> 00:26:51.291
- Here we go!
-All right!


588
00:26:51.293 --> 00:26:53.327
Looks good on you!
Red dress!


589
00:26:53.329 --> 00:26:55.863
Okay, yeah,
put the hood up here.


590
00:26:55.865 --> 00:26:57.965
Yeah! Boom!

591
00:26:57.967 --> 00:27:00.167
We should probably, uh,
carry you to the car,


592
00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:03.303
if you're comfortable
with that, uh,
we'll just lift you up.


593
00:27:03.305 --> 00:27:05.172
Yeah, sure, let's do it.

594
00:27:08.043 --> 00:27:09.877
Support the back!
Support the back!


595
00:27:09.879 --> 00:27:11.078
Oh, you know what?

596
00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.447
We had a bit
of a thing out front.


597
00:27:13.449 --> 00:27:15.616
Is there a back entrance,
by any chance?


598
00:27:15.618 --> 00:27:17.985
-Yeah, right back there.
-Perfect, great, thanks.


599
00:27:17.987 --> 00:27:22.289
Let's go, motherfucker!
We'll fucking gut you! Whoo!


600
00:27:22.291 --> 00:27:24.258
See?
It's just language.


601
00:27:30.231 --> 00:27:31.431
Well, well, well.

602
00:27:34.135 --> 00:27:36.136
Sorry, sorry.
Here you go.


603
00:27:36.138 --> 00:27:37.671
There's my wallet.

604
00:27:37.673 --> 00:27:40.207
Take that shit off.

605
00:27:47.649 --> 00:27:49.116
I got this.

606
00:27:50.985 --> 00:27:52.519
Hey, we all cool, man.

607
00:27:52.521 --> 00:27:56.323
We ain't trying to cause
no ruckus, you feel me, dawgs?


608
00:27:56.325 --> 00:28:00.994
I ain't feelin' shit, dawg.
The fuck are you?


609
00:28:00.996 --> 00:28:03.697
I'm Barack.

610
00:28:03.699 --> 00:28:05.365
Barack.

611
00:28:07.235 --> 00:28:09.269
-Like Barack Obama?
-Exactly.


612
00:28:09.271 --> 00:28:14.041
Except my man spells it
a little differently.


613
00:28:14.043 --> 00:28:16.176
Spells it differently how?

614
00:28:18.046 --> 00:28:21.114
B-r-o-c-k.

615
00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:23.150
That ain't no damn Barack.
That's Brock!


616
00:28:23.152 --> 00:28:25.585
The whitest fuckin' name
in the universe!


617
00:28:28.456 --> 00:28:31.124
Grand dragon here
got a hearing problem?


618
00:28:33.661 --> 00:28:37.064
Is that fucking pillow case
worth your life, nigga?


619
00:28:37.066 --> 00:28:39.533
Just take it off?
Slide it off?


620
00:28:39.535 --> 00:28:41.201
-Yeah, we should--
-yeah.


621
00:28:43.505 --> 00:28:45.305
Del.

622
00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:48.275
-Del?
-It's a neighborhood nickname.


623
00:28:48.277 --> 00:28:51.144
Buttersworth del barrio.
They call me del for short.


624
00:28:51.146 --> 00:28:53.280
What's up, trap, redbone,
Willis, what's popping?


625
00:28:53.282 --> 00:28:56.183
-What the hell
is you doin', man?
-It's not what it looks like.


626
00:28:56.185 --> 00:28:58.185
Looks like you've
got yourself caught up


627
00:28:58.187 --> 00:29:00.020
in some racist
fraternity bullshit.


628
00:29:00.022 --> 00:29:04.191
Oh, okay, well, then,
it's exactly what it looks like.


629
00:29:04.193 --> 00:29:06.526
But let's just chill
with the burners and stuff, man.


630
00:29:06.528 --> 00:29:08.996
No need to get mad.
Just trying to do a little thing


631
00:29:08.998 --> 00:29:11.431
with my white friends here.
Don't take offense to it.


632
00:29:11.433 --> 00:29:12.699
The closest they ever been
to a black man


633
00:29:12.701 --> 00:29:16.236
-is retweeting kanye, so...
-That's us.


634
00:29:16.238 --> 00:29:17.471
Del.

635
00:29:17.473 --> 00:29:20.140
Okay, Eddie.

636
00:29:24.112 --> 00:29:26.580
How can I say no
to dre's son?


637
00:29:26.582 --> 00:29:27.581
All right.

638
00:29:27.583 --> 00:29:29.116
But you boys best
be on your way


639
00:29:29.118 --> 00:29:31.018
before you run
into somebody a little--


640
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:35.155
less understanding than me.

641
00:29:35.157 --> 00:29:39.092
Yeah, okay, it was super
nice meeting you, guys.


642
00:29:39.094 --> 00:29:42.562
Yeah, and sorry for assuming
about the wallets, no offense.


643
00:29:42.564 --> 00:29:47.534
Oh, no, we're still gonna
need those wallets.


644
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:51.738
<i>Listen up, scumbags!</i>

645
00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.074
<i>We about to see</i>
<i>who has what it takes</i>


646
00:29:54.076 --> 00:29:57.811
<i>to become</i>
<i>a kappa Alpha chi brother.</i>


647
00:29:57.813 --> 00:29:59.513
Whatever you think
is about to happen,


648
00:29:59.515 --> 00:30:02.349
I promise you,
it's worse.


649
00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:05.519
As your pledge master,
I'm--


650
00:30:05.521 --> 00:30:09.589
eyes down! No eye contact!
Look at me! Look at him!


651
00:30:09.591 --> 00:30:11.725
Look at me! Look down!
Never look at me.


652
00:30:11.727 --> 00:30:14.227
You're not on my level.

653
00:30:14.229 --> 00:30:17.431
I'm gonna make sure
you weak fledglings


654
00:30:17.433 --> 00:30:20.567
are run through
that gauntlet...


655
00:30:20.569 --> 00:30:22.602
So you're properly
prepared...


656
00:30:26.574 --> 00:30:31.745
For a lifelong brotherhood
built on booze...


657
00:30:31.747 --> 00:30:34.081
That pussy...

658
00:30:34.083 --> 00:30:36.349
And general
kick-assedness!


659
00:30:39.621 --> 00:30:45.158
-First thing you slaves
are gonna do is--
-trigger warning.


660
00:30:48.196 --> 00:30:49.396
Sidebar.

661
00:30:51.332 --> 00:30:55.168
Man, what the fuck, I was--

662
00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:59.206
I'm not sure we should call
the pledges slaves this year.


663
00:30:59.208 --> 00:31:01.374
But we always
call them slaves.


664
00:31:01.376 --> 00:31:03.710
I know, but...

665
00:31:03.712 --> 00:31:06.713
Don't you think this year
feels little different?


666
00:31:06.715 --> 00:31:10.150
You guys talking
about the slave thing?


667
00:31:10.152 --> 00:31:13.487
Yeah, I've always felt a teensy
bit uncomfortable about that.


668
00:31:13.489 --> 00:31:15.622
Yo, the word "slave"
doesn't necessarily


669
00:31:15.624 --> 00:31:18.258
have to refer to, like,
civil war-era black slaves.


670
00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.560
In fact, it's actually derived
from the white slavic people


671
00:31:20.562 --> 00:31:22.696
who were taken as slaves
in the ninth century.


672
00:31:22.698 --> 00:31:24.798
But that doesn't change the fact
that in this day and age,


673
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.467
the word "slave"
is a racially charged term


674
00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:30.237
that harkens back
to a truly disgraceful period


675
00:31:30.239 --> 00:31:31.872
in this nation's history.

676
00:31:31.874 --> 00:31:35.642
True, but isn't it more racist
to change our traditions


677
00:31:35.644 --> 00:31:37.711
simply 'cause we got
a black pledge?


678
00:31:37.713 --> 00:31:40.413
I am so glad we're finally
having this discussion.


679
00:31:41.449 --> 00:31:43.416
Let me talk to him.

680
00:31:43.418 --> 00:31:45.552
-I-I'll talk to him.
-You go talk to him.


681
00:31:49.824 --> 00:31:52.159
-Hey, man, how's it going?
-So far, so good, thank you.


682
00:31:52.161 --> 00:31:55.762
Listen, just wanted
to check in with you.


683
00:31:55.764 --> 00:31:57.631
Some of the guys
seem to pretty set on


684
00:31:57.633 --> 00:32:00.567
referring to the pledges
as slaves.


685
00:32:00.569 --> 00:32:04.404
And I just sort of wanted to get
your take on that as a, um--


686
00:32:04.406 --> 00:32:07.240
well, I just wanted
to get your take.


687
00:32:07.242 --> 00:32:09.342
Keeping in mind
that when we use the term,


688
00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:12.179
we in no way mean,
you know, 19th century,


689
00:32:12.181 --> 00:32:14.514
cotton-picking slaves.

690
00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:16.917
Just sort of a fake term
of subservience.


691
00:32:16.919 --> 00:32:19.319
Yeah, listen,
i understand
that I'm a pledge,


692
00:32:19.321 --> 00:32:21.721
and there's certain things
that come along with that,


693
00:32:21.723 --> 00:32:23.390
but there's gonna be
a problem


694
00:32:23.392 --> 00:32:24.891
if you guys
are calling me slave.


695
00:32:24.893 --> 00:32:28.395
Say no more.
Nope.


696
00:32:28.397 --> 00:32:30.697
Okay, then!

697
00:32:33.602 --> 00:32:39.773
First thing you pledges
are gonna do is...


698
00:32:39.775 --> 00:32:42.409
Get down on your hands
and knees...


699
00:32:46.814 --> 00:32:49.382
And clean the house
with toothbrushes.


700
00:32:54.223 --> 00:32:55.622
Amazing,
this whole time,


701
00:32:55.624 --> 00:32:57.424
I'm thinking it's
gonna be a lot worse.


702
00:32:57.426 --> 00:32:58.858
Like shaving
each other's balls,


703
00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.460
or like you guys
branding us with irons,


704
00:33:00.462 --> 00:33:03.530
or making us jerk off
with hot sauce.


705
00:33:03.532 --> 00:33:05.298
But cleaning the house
with a toothbrush?


706
00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.433
I'll do that no problem.

707
00:33:06.435 --> 00:33:08.568
No problem, huh?
All right.


708
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.271
This your toothbrush.

709
00:33:11.273 --> 00:33:14.274
-Okay.
-What do you think's
gonna happen?


710
00:33:14.276 --> 00:33:18.712
Oh, hey, little Princess.
Wanna see the cave of treasures?


711
00:33:18.714 --> 00:33:20.981
Oh...

712
00:33:20.983 --> 00:33:22.382
Oh, there she go!

713
00:33:22.384 --> 00:33:24.985
Oh, he's down there!
Oh!


714
00:33:24.987 --> 00:33:27.921
-That tickles a little.
-What is wrong with you?


715
00:33:27.923 --> 00:33:32.592
Oh, it's got the tongue scraper.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!


716
00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:34.594
-That's yours now.
-Mnh-mnh, mnh-mnh!


717
00:33:34.596 --> 00:33:37.430
Yeah, let's comb your mustache.
Come on now.


718
00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:38.732
You're gonna clean with it,
pledge!


719
00:33:38.734 --> 00:33:40.900
I'm not gonna cl--

720
00:33:40.902 --> 00:33:44.838
You smell that?
Smell your own shit.


721
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.407
Guys, any of y'all want me
to clean the house with this?


722
00:33:47.409 --> 00:33:48.508
-No.
-Absolutely not.


723
00:34:02.523 --> 00:34:04.024
Pledge buttersworth.

724
00:34:05.559 --> 00:34:06.760
Yo, buttersworth.

725
00:34:06.762 --> 00:34:08.595
Oh. Yo, what's up, Brock?

726
00:34:08.597 --> 00:34:10.463
What's up, man!
Come with me.


727
00:34:10.465 --> 00:34:13.366
I got a special assignment
for you.


728
00:34:13.368 --> 00:34:16.002
Okay, after you.

729
00:34:16.004 --> 00:34:17.304
Okay.

730
00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:21.608
Now, most times,
this area is
for brothers only.


731
00:34:21.610 --> 00:34:24.544
It's off-limits
to lowly pledges
such as yourself


732
00:34:24.546 --> 00:34:26.946
without a proper escort.

733
00:34:26.948 --> 00:34:29.549
Ugh, what is that smell?

734
00:34:29.551 --> 00:34:32.686
That smell could be
a number of things.


735
00:34:32.688 --> 00:34:37.924
Could be beer or pussy,
ball sweat, rat shit.


736
00:34:37.926 --> 00:34:42.095
Or could be the Chad snyder
memorial hot tub.


737
00:34:43.398 --> 00:34:45.398
Mm, take it in.

738
00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.801
Definitely that.

739
00:34:47.803 --> 00:34:51.037
What is-- what is that?

740
00:34:53.542 --> 00:34:55.408
Brother snyder was one
of the best of us,


741
00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:56.776
house president,

742
00:34:56.778 --> 00:34:58.745
majoring
in international relations,


743
00:34:58.747 --> 00:35:02.549
2.8 grade point average,
captain of the swim team.


744
00:35:02.551 --> 00:35:06.386
-He died in this thing?
-Yeah, he drowned, mm-hmm.


745
00:35:06.388 --> 00:35:10.023
As the legend goes,
brother snyder


746
00:35:10.025 --> 00:35:12.058
was found in a fetid pool
of hot tub water,


747
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.761
jell-o shots,
and a lot of vomit.


748
00:35:14.763 --> 00:35:17.430
Oh, s-smells like you haven't
changed the water since.


749
00:35:17.432 --> 00:35:19.065
- Of course we haven't.

750
00:35:19.067 --> 00:35:21.101
That would disgrace
our fallen brother.


751
00:35:21.103 --> 00:35:23.436
-Of course.
-Look, buttersworth,


752
00:35:23.438 --> 00:35:26.373
I tried to give you
a dirty toothbrush before,


753
00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:28.675
and I'm sorry about that,
okay, that was not cool of me.


754
00:35:28.677 --> 00:35:31.111
-It wasn't.
-So I got you a fresh one.


755
00:35:31.113 --> 00:35:33.847
My man.

756
00:35:33.849 --> 00:35:36.583
Uh-oh!
I'm so clumsy.


757
00:35:36.585 --> 00:35:39.419
But go ahead and get that
for me, playa.


758
00:35:39.421 --> 00:35:40.520
Whoo!

759
00:35:40.522 --> 00:35:41.654
You-- you're evil.

760
00:35:41.656 --> 00:35:46.092
Oh, shit, come on,
buttersworth!


761
00:35:46.094 --> 00:35:48.595
Oh, shit.
Oh-- oh!


762
00:35:48.597 --> 00:35:51.564
Son of a bitch.

763
00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:53.533
Fuck, buttersworth!
Settle down, man!


764
00:35:53.535 --> 00:35:56.102
Just get the toothbrush
and clean it!


765
00:35:58.673 --> 00:36:02.442
- Dig deep!

766
00:36:05.113 --> 00:36:07.680
Son of a bitch!

767
00:36:07.682 --> 00:36:10.617
I hate my life.

768
00:36:12.052 --> 00:36:14.687
You want me to start--
start from the bottom?


769
00:36:14.689 --> 00:36:15.989
Just start cleaning.

770
00:36:17.958 --> 00:36:19.926
<i>You was so close</i>
<i>to the money!</i>


771
00:36:19.928 --> 00:36:23.730
<i>Yo, he didn't leave.</i>
<i>He was watching the whole time.</i>


772
00:36:23.732 --> 00:36:25.565
So what else they have you do?

773
00:36:25.567 --> 00:36:26.533
Did you have to do
the elephant walk?


774
00:36:26.535 --> 00:36:28.067
What's the elephant walk?

775
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:29.969
When you put one thumb
in the guy's asshole


776
00:36:29.971 --> 00:36:32.172
in front of you and then
the other thumb in your mouth,


777
00:36:32.174 --> 00:36:34.574
and when they yell "switch!,"
you switch.


778
00:36:34.576 --> 00:36:36.576
So basically,
you eat an ass-icle.


779
00:36:36.578 --> 00:36:38.745
It's an urban legend.

780
00:36:38.747 --> 00:36:41.848
Man, I ain't eating no ass-icle.
I'm done with this, I'm out.


781
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:44.884
You can't put up with it
a little longer?


782
00:36:44.886 --> 00:36:47.620
-It's a lot of money.
-And if my vote
count for anything,


783
00:36:47.622 --> 00:36:49.789
I say we stay
on this particular project.


784
00:36:49.791 --> 00:36:53.026
We? Juice, ain't no we, bro.
It's been me!


785
00:36:53.028 --> 00:36:55.562
Me in the frat house,
me digging through some puke


786
00:36:55.564 --> 00:36:57.897
and what, you saying
the elephant walk next?


787
00:36:57.899 --> 00:36:59.165
I ain't doing that, bro.

788
00:36:59.167 --> 00:37:01.067
We make one wrong move,
they call the cops.


789
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:03.937
Who go to jail, you, Alicia?
No, it's me.


790
00:37:03.939 --> 00:37:07.574
Me in the cell next to my dad,
family reunion in folsom.


791
00:37:07.576 --> 00:37:09.175
I ain't no criminal
like my father.


792
00:37:09.177 --> 00:37:11.544
I've been doing this.
Ain't no progress.


793
00:37:11.546 --> 00:37:14.914
Let's face it, man,
we not getting nothing
out that house.


794
00:37:14.916 --> 00:37:17.617
Did I just hear
the son of Andre goodlow


795
00:37:17.619 --> 00:37:19.118
decide to give up?

796
00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.887
Oh, shit.

797
00:37:22.189 --> 00:37:23.723
Uncle Leon.

798
00:37:23.725 --> 00:37:25.625
I know that's not how
my brother raised you.


799
00:37:25.627 --> 00:37:27.627
I'm pretty sure you're
not supposed to be out of jail


800
00:37:27.629 --> 00:37:29.762
for at least one,
two hundred years.


801
00:37:29.764 --> 00:37:33.633
I decided it was time
to make some lifestyle changes.


802
00:37:33.635 --> 00:37:35.201
You broke out of prison?

803
00:37:37.705 --> 00:37:39.072
Leon goodlow?

804
00:37:39.074 --> 00:37:42.876
Am I seeing a ghost,
or is that just
wishful thinking?


805
00:37:42.878 --> 00:37:44.577
Is that my best girl,
Roberta?


806
00:37:44.579 --> 00:37:46.179
I ain't a girl,
and I ain't yours.


807
00:37:46.181 --> 00:37:48.948
What the fuck
are you doing here, Leon?


808
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:51.050
Maybe I'm here
to finally charm your ass


809
00:37:51.052 --> 00:37:54.087
into doing what we should've
done a long time ago.


810
00:37:54.089 --> 00:37:57.557
I'll remind you that
I'm a good, Christian,
married woman.


811
00:37:57.559 --> 00:37:59.792
Not like dre's turning down
dick in prison.


812
00:37:59.794 --> 00:38:01.528
-Why should you?
-What?


813
00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:03.696
I'm gonna give you a moment
to think long and hard


814
00:38:03.698 --> 00:38:07.934
You don't want me to call
the police on your fugitive ass.


815
00:38:07.936 --> 00:38:09.602
-Oh, you would do that?
-Oh, I would.


816
00:38:09.604 --> 00:38:14.841
What you gonna tell them
about what your boy's got into?


817
00:38:14.843 --> 00:38:17.744
-Whatcha you been up to, del?
-Nothing!


818
00:38:17.746 --> 00:38:19.979
You just believe him
just like that?


819
00:38:19.981 --> 00:38:22.582
-Gimme a reason not to.
-He's a liar?


820
00:38:22.584 --> 00:38:23.883
-He's a felon?
-Yeah.


821
00:38:23.885 --> 00:38:26.185
You know what, ma,
you got so much
on your plate.


822
00:38:26.187 --> 00:38:28.621
I'm gonna handle this since
I'm the man of the house now--


823
00:38:28.623 --> 00:38:30.790
-since when?
-I'm-- I'm really--


824
00:38:30.792 --> 00:38:33.192
-juice, shut up.
-Ma, I'm sorry.


825
00:38:33.194 --> 00:38:37.263
Just please, please,
I'm begging,
let me handle this.


826
00:38:37.265 --> 00:38:40.633
All right,
I'll let you handle it.


827
00:38:40.635 --> 00:38:42.068
-Okay.
-But if I find out


828
00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.904
you been up doing anything
to bring shame on my household,


829
00:38:44.906 --> 00:38:48.641
del, you will no longer be
a part of that household.


830
00:38:48.643 --> 00:38:49.742
You got me?

831
00:38:49.744 --> 00:38:53.212
-Yes, ma'am.
-Out on your ass.


832
00:38:53.214 --> 00:38:56.182
-Can-- can i--
-shut your mouth, juice.


833
00:38:56.184 --> 00:38:59.118
Leon.

834
00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.621
Roberta.

835
00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:07.827
So, y'all get my money yet?

836
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:10.196
- Money?
-What?


837
00:39:10.198 --> 00:39:13.299
-Money?
-What is he talking about?


838
00:39:13.301 --> 00:39:15.702
-I know I'm broke.
-I got, um--


839
00:39:15.704 --> 00:39:18.605
-i got chapstick.
-You could use some.


840
00:39:18.607 --> 00:39:20.640
The bottom lip
a little ashy.


841
00:39:20.642 --> 00:39:22.742
Yeah, okay, okay,
i get it.


842
00:39:22.744 --> 00:39:24.777
See, you hang
with stupid,


843
00:39:24.779 --> 00:39:27.146
so you assume
everybody's stupid.


844
00:39:27.148 --> 00:39:28.181
But not me.

845
00:39:28.183 --> 00:39:31.184
See, after
i attained my freedom,


846
00:39:31.186 --> 00:39:34.053
I drove by the old place
where me and your father


847
00:39:34.055 --> 00:39:37.290
stashed our money,
and guess what?


848
00:39:37.292 --> 00:39:41.794
They turned that shit
into motherfucking fraternity!


849
00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:43.162
-Really?
-Yeah!


850
00:39:43.164 --> 00:39:45.698
-Wow.
-Now that was a surprise.


851
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.134
-But you know what was a shock?
-What's that?


852
00:39:48.136 --> 00:39:51.104
When I saw
my ghetto-ass nephew


853
00:39:51.106 --> 00:39:55.041
walking out of that fraternity
like he fucking belonged there!


854
00:39:55.043 --> 00:39:57.844
Uh, me?
Oh, y-- oh, yeah!


855
00:39:57.846 --> 00:40:00.647
It slipped my mind,
i had went back to go to school


856
00:40:00.649 --> 00:40:02.015
and the guys was cool,

857
00:40:02.017 --> 00:40:03.850
but there's money
in the basement?


858
00:40:03.852 --> 00:40:05.818
I didn't know
there was money there.


859
00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.788
Okay, let me
get this straight.


860
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:11.724
Okay?
Just to make it clear.


861
00:40:11.726 --> 00:40:15.228
You got all studied up
on your sats and shit.


862
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.163
Yeah, I did get
an 800 on my sats.


863
00:40:17.165 --> 00:40:19.265
It's out of 1,600,
motherfucker.


864
00:40:19.267 --> 00:40:22.301
I'm gonna take
the second half later.


865
00:40:22.303 --> 00:40:25.071
Then magically,
you came up with the money


866
00:40:25.073 --> 00:40:28.041
to attend one of the most
expensive-ass schools


867
00:40:28.043 --> 00:40:31.044
in the country,
and then on a whim


868
00:40:31.046 --> 00:40:33.813
joined a fraternity
that just so happened


869
00:40:33.815 --> 00:40:36.215
to be at the same address
as the place


870
00:40:36.217 --> 00:40:39.786
where we stashed our
money after the bank job?!


871
00:40:39.788 --> 00:40:41.721
Is that right?!

872
00:40:41.723 --> 00:40:44.457
You know what?
This the problem.


873
00:40:44.459 --> 00:40:46.826
This exactly why
young black men can't achieve


874
00:40:46.828 --> 00:40:48.961
greatness in this country,
because of the doubters.


875
00:40:48.963 --> 00:40:50.296
-Preach.
-The haters.


876
00:40:50.298 --> 00:40:52.331
This is the first goodlow
to go to college.


877
00:40:52.333 --> 00:40:55.101
You can't you be happy
for your nephew
for just one minute?


878
00:40:56.136 --> 00:40:59.105
Okay, but you gotta admit.

879
00:40:59.107 --> 00:41:01.340
That's a crazy coincidence,
ain't it?


880
00:41:01.342 --> 00:41:03.176
-Little bit.
-Yeah, it's crazy.


881
00:41:03.178 --> 00:41:05.712
-It's crazy.
-It's crazy.


882
00:41:05.714 --> 00:41:06.979
Where's my money, del?!

883
00:41:06.981 --> 00:41:09.749
Shit, okay, okay,
uncle Leon, just chill.


884
00:41:09.751 --> 00:41:11.484
If you gonna blast me,
then blast me,


885
00:41:11.486 --> 00:41:13.886
but that don't change the fact
that I don't got the money.


886
00:41:13.888 --> 00:41:16.823
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, okay. Okay.


887
00:41:16.825 --> 00:41:18.324
This your girlfriend?

888
00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:21.761
Nope.

889
00:41:21.763 --> 00:41:24.964
I mean...
She do be liking


890
00:41:24.966 --> 00:41:28.401
my pictures on instagram
late at night, so....


891
00:41:28.403 --> 00:41:31.370
You ever seen somebody
get they face blown apart, del?


892
00:41:31.372 --> 00:41:33.039
I have.

893
00:41:33.041 --> 00:41:35.241
Now ask yourself,
do you want this


894
00:41:35.243 --> 00:41:39.078
to be the last memory
of this girl right here?


895
00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:43.516
'Cause that shit that
sticks with you, believe.


896
00:41:43.518 --> 00:41:45.218
All right, look, I've--

897
00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:47.186
I've been trying
to get the money.


898
00:41:47.188 --> 00:41:49.522
But it hasn't been easy.
I'm pledging the house.


899
00:41:49.524 --> 00:41:52.024
But these guys, they're intense,
you know what I'm saying?


900
00:41:52.026 --> 00:41:54.227
They never go to sleep,
but I'm real close.


901
00:41:54.229 --> 00:41:56.863
Just gimme a few more days,
and I'll have your money.


902
00:41:56.865 --> 00:41:58.498
I just need more time,
all right?


903
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.935
All right, I'll give you
two days to do your thing.


904
00:42:02.937 --> 00:42:04.403
Two days and two nights
or just a flat--


905
00:42:04.405 --> 00:42:09.008
If you don't get it, I'm gonna
go in there my damn self.


906
00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:12.879
Maybe your way,
those kappa gamma bitches


907
00:42:12.881 --> 00:42:14.514
won't get they dicks
shot off.


908
00:42:14.516 --> 00:42:15.982
-Oh.
-Hmm?


909
00:42:15.984 --> 00:42:17.950
Now I'm gonna go in here

910
00:42:17.952 --> 00:42:20.820
with your sexy-ass momma

911
00:42:20.822 --> 00:42:25.291
and see if she make me some
of her world-famous sassy eggs.


912
00:42:25.293 --> 00:42:26.959
Come on, man.

913
00:42:34.835 --> 00:42:36.068
What, juice?

914
00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.070
Does this affect my 5%?

915
00:42:49.082 --> 00:42:52.819
Alcohol! Alcohol!

916
00:42:52.821 --> 00:42:56.489
My baby brought me a beer!
That's a good baby!


917
00:42:56.491 --> 00:42:58.958
He looks like me
a little bit, right?


918
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.159
-
-Suck it.

919
00:43:00.161 --> 00:43:02.361
- Suck it!

920
00:43:05.999 --> 00:43:09.135
Okay, so my thing
is I can always tell


921
00:43:09.137 --> 00:43:11.838
when they don't use
real dinosaurs in movies.


922
00:43:27.221 --> 00:43:30.156
-Pledge buttersworth!
-Oh, shit!


923
00:43:30.158 --> 00:43:31.457
What are you doing
in here, man?


924
00:43:31.459 --> 00:43:33.192
You should be out there
with the other babies.


925
00:43:33.194 --> 00:43:35.328
Yeah, I just wanna use
the bathroom real quick.


926
00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:37.430
What do you think
that diaper's for?


927
00:43:40.134 --> 00:43:43.035
No, I'm just playing, no!

928
00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:44.871
But there's no bathroom
in there, man.


929
00:43:44.873 --> 00:43:47.406
That's the basement.
There's no need
to go in there.


930
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:51.310
Listen, man, sometimes i
just need a place to think,


931
00:43:51.312 --> 00:43:53.980
like, clear my thoughts,
and I just thought down there


932
00:43:53.982 --> 00:43:55.648
would be best.

933
00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:58.117
I get it, man.

934
00:43:58.119 --> 00:44:00.553
I know this hazing stuff
is exhausting.


935
00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:02.054
Yeah, so exhausting.

936
00:44:02.056 --> 00:44:03.990
-Degrading.
-You got me in a diaper.


937
00:44:03.992 --> 00:44:06.058
I know it's silly, man.

938
00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.227
But once you make it
through this,


939
00:44:08.229 --> 00:44:10.930
we're brothers, family,

940
00:44:10.932 --> 00:44:15.368
tell each other secrets,
watch each other's backs.


941
00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:18.938
So you gonna join
this family?


942
00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.474
Yeah, man.
I'm gonna do it.


943
00:44:21.476 --> 00:44:22.942
Okay.

944
00:44:22.944 --> 00:44:27.046
Man, what you talking about?
Get out there with the babies.


945
00:44:27.048 --> 00:44:29.282
Come on, man!
Do the baby walk, though.


946
00:44:29.284 --> 00:44:32.451
Do that-- do that baby walk.
There it go.


947
00:44:32.453 --> 00:44:34.287
-Ay, hit it, work, yeah.
-Million dollars.


948
00:44:34.289 --> 00:44:35.922
Glad we had this talk, man.

949
00:44:35.924 --> 00:44:37.990
- Great talk.

950
00:44:37.992 --> 00:44:39.992
<i>Listen up, babies!</i>

951
00:44:39.994 --> 00:44:42.361
You may think
pledging is all diapers,


952
00:44:42.363 --> 00:44:44.530
binkies,
and verbal abuse...


953
00:44:44.532 --> 00:44:49.235
...but it's also about
giving back to the community.


954
00:44:49.237 --> 00:44:51.971
So our red hot bros
and filthy rich females


955
00:44:51.973 --> 00:44:54.440
charity gala is coming up,
and you dirtbags,


956
00:44:54.442 --> 00:44:58.344
along with our beautiful selves
are gonna be auctioned off


957
00:44:58.346 --> 00:45:01.514
to the highest bidders
from our sister sorority--


958
00:45:01.516 --> 00:45:04.450
-trigger warning!
-Whoa, whoa, t.W., t.W.


959
00:45:04.452 --> 00:45:05.952
What's that,
pledge buttersworth?


960
00:45:05.954 --> 00:45:07.486
I'm sorry,
i just thought I heard him say


961
00:45:07.488 --> 00:45:10.156
that you guys were
gonna auction us off?


962
00:45:10.158 --> 00:45:12.224
Well, yeah, in order
to raise money


963
00:45:12.226 --> 00:45:14.093
for local charities,
you'll be auctioned off--


964
00:45:14.095 --> 00:45:16.095
-oh, I hear it now.
-Oh, shit, not again.


965
00:45:16.097 --> 00:45:18.030
Come on, man!
You can't be serious!


966
00:45:18.032 --> 00:45:20.066
Oh, I'm sorry, Brock,
if you and I have


967
00:45:20.068 --> 00:45:22.234
a slightly different reaction
to the idea of us being


968
00:45:22.236 --> 00:45:24.036
auctioned off
to rich white people


969
00:45:24.038 --> 00:45:26.072
outside
of a plantation house.


970
00:45:26.074 --> 00:45:29.075
Okay, let's bro-dle.
Hey, bro-dle.


971
00:45:32.045 --> 00:45:34.146
No way he's getting
out of this.


972
00:45:38.018 --> 00:45:40.086
Hey, look, I knew
a black guy growing up,


973
00:45:40.088 --> 00:45:41.287
and he was not like this,
man.


974
00:45:41.289 --> 00:45:43.222
You could say anything
you wanted to him.


975
00:45:43.224 --> 00:45:45.124
Yeah, he even
let me touch his hair.


976
00:45:47.095 --> 00:45:48.294
Okay, yeah.

977
00:45:48.296 --> 00:45:50.329
-Buttersworth?
-Yeah.


978
00:45:50.331 --> 00:45:51.630
You don't have to be
auctioned off.


979
00:45:51.632 --> 00:45:53.199
We're gonna make you
the auctioneer.


980
00:45:53.201 --> 00:45:54.667
It'll be empowering!

981
00:45:58.005 --> 00:46:00.006
Yeah, yeah,
i guess that works.


982
00:46:00.008 --> 00:46:02.341
It's an affirmative auction.

983
00:46:02.343 --> 00:46:04.443
<i>I am a master.</i>

984
00:46:04.445 --> 00:46:07.046
I play white guilt like
Michael Jordan plays basketball.


985
00:46:07.048 --> 00:46:09.382
I'm talking like Stevie wonder
plays the piano.


986
00:46:09.384 --> 00:46:11.784
Okay, so you're
the auctioneer.


987
00:46:11.786 --> 00:46:13.619
-Mm-hmm.
-So what?


988
00:46:13.621 --> 00:46:16.555
<i>So since that I'm</i>
<i>in charge of the proceedings...</i>


989
00:46:16.557 --> 00:46:18.591
Don't mess this up, pledge!

990
00:46:18.593 --> 00:46:21.293
<i>...i can keep them busy while</i>
<i>you guys go look for the money.</i>


991
00:46:21.295 --> 00:46:23.629
Now, my great-great-great-
great-granddaddy


992
00:46:23.631 --> 00:46:25.164
would love
to hear me say this.


993
00:46:25.166 --> 00:46:26.499
Get your billfolds out

994
00:46:26.501 --> 00:46:28.167
'cause we buying
white people today!


995
00:46:28.169 --> 00:46:31.437
Yeah!
Make some noise!


996
00:46:31.439 --> 00:46:33.305
First, we're gonna need
to figure out


997
00:46:33.307 --> 00:46:35.174
a way to get
you into the party.


998
00:46:35.176 --> 00:46:37.610
How about having tits
and a pulse?


999
00:46:39.212 --> 00:46:41.447
<i>That'll work.</i>

1000
00:46:41.449 --> 00:46:44.383
<i>Once everyone's outside,</i>
<i>juice, you're gonna slip</i>


1001
00:46:44.385 --> 00:46:47.053
<i>into the basement</i>
<i>and make your move.</i>


1002
00:46:47.055 --> 00:46:48.621
<i>The longer I can keep</i>
<i>the auction going,</i>


1003
00:46:48.623 --> 00:46:52.158
<i>the more time it buys us</i>
<i>to look for the money.</i>


1004
00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.626
Come on!

1005
00:46:53.628 --> 00:46:57.096
<i>I'll make sure the tools</i>
<i>are down there waiting for you.</i>


1006
00:46:57.098 --> 00:46:59.498
- 
- Oh! Whoa.

1007
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.735
Oh, y-- oh. Ah, yeah.
That's your spot right there.


1008
00:47:02.737 --> 00:47:07.106
Brother Clarke here is actually
an amazing impressionist.


1009
00:47:07.108 --> 00:47:09.442
-No.
-Yes, got some impressions
for us, don't you?


1010
00:47:09.444 --> 00:47:12.511
-I do not.
-Um...


1011
00:47:12.513 --> 00:47:14.113
Whoo!

1012
00:47:14.115 --> 00:47:16.148
You're a little tight.

1013
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:17.817
Okay, you--
you kinda like my ex.


1014
00:47:17.819 --> 00:47:20.519
It's kinda hard to find your
spot, but I'm gonna find you.


1015
00:47:20.521 --> 00:47:22.354
Why don't you try someone
that everybody knows?


1016
00:47:22.356 --> 00:47:24.523
Like Denzel Washington,
you know, put
your shoulders up.


1017
00:47:24.525 --> 00:47:27.359
"Okay, all right, huh?
What, are we at an auction?


1018
00:47:27.361 --> 00:47:28.494
What, are we gonna buy
white people?


1019
00:47:28.496 --> 00:47:29.762
That's what you telling me?

1020
00:47:29.764 --> 00:47:31.564
You telling me you gonna buy
white people?


1021
00:47:31.566 --> 00:47:34.200
What type of white people
are we gonna buy, huh?"


1022
00:47:34.202 --> 00:47:37.436
I don't think
i should do that.


1023
00:47:37.438 --> 00:47:39.505
And now let's get brother Ben
to the stage,


1024
00:47:39.507 --> 00:47:42.341
ladies and gentlemen, Ben!

1025
00:47:42.343 --> 00:47:45.177
Oh, come on, bro,
that's not cool.


1026
00:47:45.179 --> 00:47:48.781
What are you talking about, man?
Drawing dicks is always funny.


1027
00:47:48.783 --> 00:47:51.617
You ladies know our resident
sexpert, brother Eddie.


1028
00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:54.153
I'd like to dedicate
this first move


1029
00:47:54.155 --> 00:47:57.523
to an invention that changed
the face of modern warfare...


1030
00:47:57.525 --> 00:47:58.557
And sexuality.

1031
00:47:58.559 --> 00:48:00.593
It's called the gatling gun.

1032
00:48:00.595 --> 00:48:02.728
It works best
if she's bow-legged.


1033
00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:06.465
Am I right, Sarah?
Wink face.


1034
00:48:09.603 --> 00:48:12.138
Maybe Mike Tyson,
famous boxer?


1035
00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:14.240
"I got these--
i got these pigeons here.


1036
00:48:14.242 --> 00:48:18.277
And we put
these pigeons together
and we make them kiss."


1037
00:48:18.279 --> 00:48:20.312
Yeah, no,
definitely not that one.


1038
00:48:20.314 --> 00:48:22.248
I give you...

1039
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:23.849
The pinwheel.

1040
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.725
Do you know any comedians?
Do you know bill cosby?


1041
00:48:32.727 --> 00:48:35.227
I could maybe try that.

1042
00:48:35.229 --> 00:48:38.264
Perfect. Ladies and gentlemen,
bill cosby.


1043
00:48:40.668 --> 00:48:42.601
"You see...

1044
00:48:42.603 --> 00:48:45.471
When...
She eats the pud-ding,


1045
00:48:45.473 --> 00:48:48.274
you put the quaaludes
in the pud-ding


1046
00:48:48.276 --> 00:48:49.742
and then she eats
the pud-ding,


1047
00:48:49.744 --> 00:48:51.944
and she gets sleepy
with the pud-ding.


1048
00:48:51.946 --> 00:48:54.246
And then you climb
on top of her


1049
00:48:54.248 --> 00:48:55.948
and you put
in your black penis--"


1050
00:48:55.950 --> 00:49:00.486
guys, um, Clarke,
anybody wanna bid on Clarke?


1051
00:49:00.488 --> 00:49:04.223
I'm through playing
motherfucking games with you!


1052
00:49:04.225 --> 00:49:06.725
Right now!
Done playing games, uh-huh!


1053
00:49:06.727 --> 00:49:09.261
Yeah!
You brought it on yourself!


1054
00:49:09.263 --> 00:49:11.697
- Okay, okay.

1055
00:49:11.699 --> 00:49:15.734
Oh! Oh, my--
these white boys got rats.


1056
00:49:15.736 --> 00:49:19.805
Are they keeping them as pets?
Where'd it go?


1057
00:49:19.807 --> 00:49:21.273
And finally...

1058
00:49:21.275 --> 00:49:23.275
A very special move
taught to me


1059
00:49:23.277 --> 00:49:25.411
by a very special woman.

1060
00:49:25.413 --> 00:49:28.681
Thanks, mom.
This is called the pile driver.


1061
00:49:28.683 --> 00:49:31.584
Be careful.
It's rough on the spine.


1062
00:49:38.858 --> 00:49:40.626
Good job, Eddie!

1063
00:49:40.628 --> 00:49:43.596
All right, come on, someone's
gotta find that appealing.


1064
00:49:45.699 --> 00:49:47.600
And now a man who used
a macklemore Lyric


1065
00:49:47.602 --> 00:49:52.238
as his yearbook quote,
brother Brock with a freestyle.


1066
00:49:55.543 --> 00:49:58.877
Okay, okay, all right,
all right, okay.


1067
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:04.817
Brock in the building,
and I'm feeling fly.


1068
00:50:04.819 --> 00:50:07.553
Tux like James Bond,
got that golden eye.


1069
00:50:07.555 --> 00:50:10.589
Bars on bars
like the candy shop.


1070
00:50:10.591 --> 00:50:13.292
Bid on me, girls,
I'll make your panties drop.


1071
00:50:13.294 --> 00:50:16.862
Okay, once you go Brock,
you might never go back.


1072
00:50:16.864 --> 00:50:19.765
Make your body numb
like a heart attack.


1073
00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:22.768
Okay, here's your chance,
so pull the trigger.


1074
00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.537
Put it down on you
'cause I'm a dope-ass--


1075
00:50:29.509 --> 00:50:32.544
the fuck am I supposed
to say to that?


1076
00:50:32.546 --> 00:50:35.948
<i>Wait,</i>
<i>did you forget about me?</i>


1077
00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:37.383
<i>Why am I there?</i>

1078
00:50:37.385 --> 00:50:38.617
You're gonna bid on Brock.

1079
00:50:38.619 --> 00:50:40.586
He's been on me
since I got there.


1080
00:50:40.588 --> 00:50:42.354
I just need you to keep him
out the basement.


1081
00:50:42.356 --> 00:50:44.290
I'm not fucking him.

1082
00:50:44.292 --> 00:50:46.292
-What? No, no, no.
-No!


1083
00:50:46.294 --> 00:50:48.427
Never.
Don't do that ever.


1084
00:50:48.429 --> 00:50:50.296
-You want me to fuck him?
-What?


1085
00:50:50.298 --> 00:50:51.397
It's a million dollars!

1086
00:50:51.399 --> 00:50:53.832
Yeah, but you are only
making 50k.


1087
00:50:53.834 --> 00:50:56.702
For 50 gs, my list of not-dos
is pretty short.


1088
00:50:56.704 --> 00:50:58.904
Okay, walk it back a step.

1089
00:50:58.906 --> 00:51:00.873
You want me to win him
in the auction, right?


1090
00:51:00.875 --> 00:51:03.309
- Yeah.
-What am I winning him with?


1091
00:51:03.311 --> 00:51:05.377
We're broke.

1092
00:51:05.379 --> 00:51:08.314
36, 38--
oh, I got a scratcher.


1093
00:51:08.316 --> 00:51:11.617
Wait a minute.

1094
00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.520
We got 38.

1095
00:51:14.522 --> 00:51:17.489
$42 and 68 cents.

1096
00:51:17.491 --> 00:51:20.025
How is that gonna be enough?

1097
00:51:20.027 --> 00:51:22.761
I'll make it be enough.

1098
00:51:22.763 --> 00:51:24.463
$20.

1099
00:51:25.632 --> 00:51:27.066
$25.

1100
00:51:28.902 --> 00:51:31.603
-$25.
-$30!


1101
00:51:31.605 --> 00:51:34.907
-35!
-$35!


1102
00:51:34.909 --> 00:51:36.709
40!

1103
00:51:38.878 --> 00:51:40.713
Forty... two.

1104
00:51:42.682 --> 00:51:45.384
$50!

1105
00:51:45.386 --> 00:51:47.619
$42 going once!

1106
00:51:48.922 --> 00:51:51.056
I just said 50!

1107
00:51:51.058 --> 00:51:52.725
$42 going twice!

1108
00:51:52.727 --> 00:51:55.961
-50!
-Sold to the women
in the red dress!


1109
00:51:55.963 --> 00:51:57.963
Are you, deaf, asshole?!

1110
00:51:57.965 --> 00:52:00.699
This is not how auctions work,
dumbass.


1111
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:06.004
Nice work, buttersworth.

1112
00:52:06.006 --> 00:52:08.707
Hey, go get 'em.

1113
00:52:15.482 --> 00:52:20.452
So.
I haven't seen you
around before.


1114
00:52:20.454 --> 00:52:23.889
Yeah, well, we should talk.
It's a nice night.


1115
00:52:25.091 --> 00:52:27.726
You wanna go for a walk?

1116
00:52:27.728 --> 00:52:30.929
Nah, I got something
special for you.


1117
00:52:30.931 --> 00:52:32.064
Follow me.

1118
00:52:34.067 --> 00:52:36.668
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna tear
this mother down.


1119
00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:39.671
Uh-huh, yeah! Yeah!

1120
00:52:39.673 --> 00:52:42.541
Oh, found you.

1121
00:52:44.744 --> 00:52:48.013
Oh, yeah,
i found the money!


1122
00:52:48.015 --> 00:52:49.715
I found the--

1123
00:52:49.717 --> 00:52:52.418
so I had one of
my clueless pledges


1124
00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:54.620
clean this place
with a toothbrush!


1125
00:52:54.622 --> 00:52:57.856
Actually, let's go for a drink
at the bar out back.


1126
00:52:57.858 --> 00:52:59.792
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Let's get out of here.


1127
00:52:59.794 --> 00:53:01.894
The thing is I got us
all covered.


1128
00:53:01.896 --> 00:53:03.896
-Okay, I'm coming.
-Come on.


1129
00:53:03.898 --> 00:53:07.433
I got us covered down here.

1130
00:53:07.435 --> 00:53:09.568
-You bid on me, right?
-That's right.


1131
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:15.674
Voila, I whipped up
this little surprise


1132
00:53:15.676 --> 00:53:17.443
just for the occasion.

1133
00:53:17.445 --> 00:53:19.511
Wow.

1134
00:53:19.513 --> 00:53:21.780
You did all of this?

1135
00:53:21.782 --> 00:53:24.450
-That's impressive.
-Yeah.


1136
00:53:24.452 --> 00:53:26.218
Let's get out of here,
I'm feeling claustrophobic.


1137
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:29.955
Whoa, whoa, there's no need
to be so anxious.


1138
00:53:29.957 --> 00:53:32.991
You want to talk,
let's talk.


1139
00:53:32.993 --> 00:53:34.526
Let's talk.

1140
00:53:39.866 --> 00:53:42.568
Let's get to know
each other better.


1141
00:53:44.504 --> 00:53:45.671
What are you looking at--

1142
00:53:45.673 --> 00:53:47.539
-you.
-Your titties?


1143
00:53:47.541 --> 00:53:49.141
Yeah, I'm looking at you.

1144
00:53:49.143 --> 00:53:51.577
This is dope.

1145
00:53:51.579 --> 00:53:53.545
So, uh...

1146
00:53:53.547 --> 00:53:55.514
Feel like maybe
a lap dance?


1147
00:53:55.516 --> 00:53:59.551
Sure. Oh, yeah.

1148
00:54:00.787 --> 00:54:02.588
Go ahead.

1149
00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:05.824
No, I meant
you give me one.


1150
00:54:05.826 --> 00:54:09.895
A man giving a woman
a lap dance...


1151
00:54:09.897 --> 00:54:11.930
It's an instant
panty dropper.


1152
00:54:14.267 --> 00:54:15.234
What?

1153
00:54:15.236 --> 00:54:16.869
Oh, yeah.

1154
00:54:16.871 --> 00:54:18.270
Okay.

1155
00:54:18.272 --> 00:54:20.806
All you can handle.

1156
00:54:20.808 --> 00:54:23.976
-Yeah?
-Okay, all right.


1157
00:54:23.978 --> 00:54:25.811
You're on
some feminism shit.


1158
00:54:25.813 --> 00:54:28.747
Got the empowered woman.
Well, bring it, girl.


1159
00:54:28.749 --> 00:54:31.850
-
-Okay. Here we go.

1160
00:54:31.852 --> 00:54:33.252
Whoo!

1161
00:54:33.254 --> 00:54:36.255
Yeah,
already getting so sexy.


1162
00:54:36.257 --> 00:54:39.258
So good.
Keep doing it.


1163
00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:42.027
-Yeah, you like that?
-Getting super wet over it.


1164
00:54:42.029 --> 00:54:44.897
Yeah, tell me
what you want, baby.


1165
00:54:44.899 --> 00:54:47.533
Just keep looking at me.
Oh, my god.


1166
00:54:47.535 --> 00:54:49.635
-Whoo! Okay!
-Love it. Yeah.


1167
00:54:49.637 --> 00:54:51.169
Take<i>something</i> off.

1168
00:54:51.171 --> 00:54:52.938
-Whoo! Yeah!
-So hot.


1169
00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:54.940
-See that belly button?
-Flash it again.


1170
00:54:54.942 --> 00:54:56.675
-Oh? Oh.
-Yeah, oh, my god.


1171
00:54:56.677 --> 00:54:58.143
-I love it.
-Yeah, it's an innie-outie.


1172
00:54:58.145 --> 00:55:00.879
It's like in,
but it's out. Whoo!


1173
00:55:00.881 --> 00:55:04.249
Keep facing
towards me, yeah.


1174
00:55:04.251 --> 00:55:07.119
Oh, my, oh!

1175
00:55:07.121 --> 00:55:09.721
Oh, my god, so dangerous!

1176
00:55:09.723 --> 00:55:12.591
Yeah, it's like Justin beiber
and Austin powers


1177
00:55:12.593 --> 00:55:14.126
had a baby, and it's you.

1178
00:55:14.128 --> 00:55:17.563
-Oh, that's my belly button!
-Oh, my god, get it off!


1179
00:55:17.565 --> 00:55:19.598
And there are your pants
coming off.


1180
00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:23.001
Oh, my god.
Oh, my-- it's so hot.


1181
00:55:23.003 --> 00:55:25.103
Yeah, do that thing.
What is that?


1182
00:55:25.105 --> 00:55:27.272
-Is that a dab?
-That's called the dab.


1183
00:55:27.274 --> 00:55:28.674
That's so good.

1184
00:55:28.676 --> 00:55:30.609
And then I'll dab it
over here.


1185
00:55:30.611 --> 00:55:32.711
-No!
-Shit, ow, girl!


1186
00:55:32.713 --> 00:55:35.647
Yeah, face down, ass up.

1187
00:55:35.649 --> 00:55:38.150
That's the way
we like to fuck!


1188
00:55:38.152 --> 00:55:40.319
You filthy, girl.
I love it.


1189
00:55:40.321 --> 00:55:42.120
-Yeah?
-Yeah, all right.


1190
00:55:42.122 --> 00:55:44.723
Man, this like
a new experience for me.


1191
00:55:44.725 --> 00:55:48.327
I feel both degraded
and empowered.


1192
00:55:48.329 --> 00:55:51.330
Is that what it's like
to be a woman?


1193
00:55:51.332 --> 00:55:52.631
You still there, baby? Oh!

1194
00:55:52.633 --> 00:55:54.066
Keep your face away.

1195
00:55:54.068 --> 00:55:57.669
Yeah, I'm a bad boy.
I think I need to be spanked.


1196
00:55:57.671 --> 00:55:59.371
-Spanked?
-Ooh!


1197
00:55:59.373 --> 00:56:02.674
-Yeah?
-Go on. I've been a bad boy.


1198
00:56:02.676 --> 00:56:04.943
Punish me, girl!

1199
00:56:04.945 --> 00:56:08.347
I'm so bad.
Put something on it, girl.


1200
00:56:08.349 --> 00:56:09.781
I'm ready.

1201
00:56:09.783 --> 00:56:13.619
Ooh! Fuck! Shit!
That stings!


1202
00:56:13.621 --> 00:56:16.989
You're insane, girl!
Mm! I'm sorry!


1203
00:56:16.991 --> 00:56:19.091
God...

1204
00:56:19.093 --> 00:56:23.395
I'm in charge here.
I clearly can't trust you.


1205
00:56:23.397 --> 00:56:25.197
I'm gonna have
to tie you up.


1206
00:56:25.199 --> 00:56:28.400
-Yeah.
-Keep facing the wall, bitch.


1207
00:56:28.402 --> 00:56:30.302
Tighter, baby. Ooh.

1208
00:56:30.304 --> 00:56:33.739
-Time for the blindfold.
-Oh, oh, yeah.


1209
00:56:33.741 --> 00:56:36.642
-
-Mm-hmm.

1210
00:56:36.644 --> 00:56:37.909
-Yeah.
-Like that?


1211
00:56:37.911 --> 00:56:40.646
Yes, ma'am, damn.

1212
00:56:47.187 --> 00:56:48.654
Oh, yeah.

1213
00:56:48.656 --> 00:56:50.389
Hey, it's kind of wet.

1214
00:56:50.391 --> 00:56:52.324
Yeah?

1215
00:56:52.326 --> 00:56:54.826
Y-yeah.

1216
00:56:54.828 --> 00:56:58.430
How do you think
it got that way?


1217
00:56:58.432 --> 00:57:01.266
Okay.

1218
00:57:01.268 --> 00:57:04.703
You pungent
as you is beautiful, okay.


1219
00:57:04.705 --> 00:57:06.672
But now it's my turn,
all right?


1220
00:57:06.674 --> 00:57:09.775
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

1221
00:57:09.777 --> 00:57:11.109
I'm in charge now.

1222
00:57:11.111 --> 00:57:13.345
Look, I know you're
not used to this,


1223
00:57:13.347 --> 00:57:16.314
but I'm a brother
who's not afraid


1224
00:57:16.316 --> 00:57:18.250
to go down on a girl.

1225
00:57:18.252 --> 00:57:22.421
So you just go ahead
and you hike that skirt up


1226
00:57:22.423 --> 00:57:25.724
and get some ready
for some heaven, okay?


1227
00:57:25.726 --> 00:57:26.858
- Here we go.

1228
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.261
-
-You excited, okay, girl.

1229
00:57:29.263 --> 00:57:31.863
-I get it. Oh!
-Ooh! So excited.


1230
00:57:39.272 --> 00:57:42.708
Oh, damn you, like,
got it all '70s and shit.


1231
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:43.742
Yeah.

1232
00:57:43.744 --> 00:57:45.777
I can dig it natural.

1233
00:57:45.779 --> 00:57:49.181
-Oh.
-Don't stop, oh, yeah.


1234
00:57:49.183 --> 00:57:55.487
You ever had someone beatbox?

1235
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:59.991
Keep going all night,
baby.


1236
00:57:59.993 --> 00:58:03.361
Don't stop for any...
Reason.


1237
00:58:03.363 --> 00:58:07.766
Oh, shit, your pussy's
squeaking a little bit.


1238
00:58:07.768 --> 00:58:09.768
Here we go, here we go.
Hey, what's up, everybody?


1239
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:11.303
Hey,
we got the money--


1240
00:58:11.305 --> 00:58:14.973
no, hey, no snapchat,
no instagram, no nothing, man.


1241
00:58:14.975 --> 00:58:16.341
How's your phone
even working?


1242
00:58:16.343 --> 00:58:17.809
Ya'll ain't got
no boost mobile?


1243
00:58:17.811 --> 00:58:20.345
All right, man,
stop with the pictures.


1244
00:58:20.347 --> 00:58:22.781
Open that shit up,
let's see what we got.


1245
00:58:22.783 --> 00:58:27.185
Get it, baby!

1246
00:58:27.187 --> 00:58:30.255
How does it smell?
How does it feel?


1247
00:58:30.257 --> 00:58:35.227
We got a blockbuster DVD
of<i>encino man.</i>


1248
00:58:35.229 --> 00:58:38.130
-Say what?
-Yep, take a look.


1249
00:58:38.132 --> 00:58:42.801
Oh, we got a mix tape,
the "big Booty grind" mix.


1250
00:58:42.803 --> 00:58:45.804
Big Booty grind?
The fuck is that?


1251
00:58:45.806 --> 00:58:47.205
-We got a zima.
-The money, look--


1252
00:58:47.207 --> 00:58:49.274
-oh, it's a note.
-What?


1253
00:58:49.276 --> 00:58:51.343
"Dear kappa Alpha chi
brothers of the future.


1254
00:58:51.345 --> 00:58:53.945
We are burying this time capsule
in the wall of our house


1255
00:58:53.947 --> 00:58:56.047
in hopes that you will
one day uncover it


1256
00:58:56.049 --> 00:58:58.083
and see how your ancestors
partied.


1257
00:58:58.085 --> 00:59:01.887
What is the future like?
Are there blow-job robots?"


1258
00:59:01.889 --> 00:59:03.021
<i>A fucking time capsule?</i>

1259
00:59:03.023 --> 00:59:04.523
<i>What's a time capsule?</i>

1260
00:59:04.525 --> 00:59:05.991
<i>No money?</i>

1261
00:59:05.993 --> 00:59:08.260
<i>Everybody gonna get</i>
<i>their dick shot off.</i>


1262
00:59:08.262 --> 00:59:10.228
<i>I do love</i>
encino man,<i>though.</i>


1263
00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:12.931
-Yo, yo, del--
-fuck!


1264
00:59:12.933 --> 00:59:14.065
Shit! Fuck! Fuck!

1265
00:59:14.067 --> 00:59:16.134
Man, this is your car!

1266
00:59:16.136 --> 00:59:20.505
Gimme that thing!
Fuck this shit!


1267
00:59:20.507 --> 00:59:22.507
We tried.
It's over.


1268
00:59:22.509 --> 00:59:26.211
If we got in the basement once,
we can get in there again.


1269
00:59:26.213 --> 00:59:29.481
How? We barely
got in there tonight.


1270
00:59:29.483 --> 00:59:31.817
Uncle Leon's gonna track us
down, and it's over.


1271
00:59:31.819 --> 00:59:34.352
What don't y'all get?

1272
00:59:34.354 --> 00:59:37.122
I'm done with this shit,
for real this time.


1273
00:59:37.124 --> 00:59:39.024
Wow.

1274
00:59:39.026 --> 00:59:41.493
Del goodlow not following
through on something.


1275
00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:43.028
I can't believe it.

1276
00:59:44.931 --> 00:59:46.398
And what's that
supposed to mean?


1277
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:50.168
You've never seen anything
through in your whole life.


1278
00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:52.537
But then your dad told you
about the money,


1279
00:59:52.539 --> 00:59:56.575
and I saw a side of you
I've never seen before.


1280
00:59:56.577 --> 00:59:58.910
You were taking charge.

1281
00:59:58.912 --> 01:00:01.112
Coming up with plans,

1282
01:00:01.114 --> 01:00:03.615
trying to do right by your mom,
charming your way


1283
01:00:03.617 --> 01:00:04.883
into a rich frat house.

1284
01:00:04.885 --> 01:00:06.852
I mean,
for a second there?


1285
01:00:06.854 --> 01:00:10.355
I was actually
impressed by you.


1286
01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:13.391
You know, I thought
you were doing this


1287
01:00:13.393 --> 01:00:16.127
to save those friends
of yours from Leon,


1288
01:00:16.129 --> 01:00:18.463
but if you're giving up,
then I guess not.


1289
01:00:20.066 --> 01:00:22.334
I mean, what do
you care, right?


1290
01:00:25.605 --> 01:00:27.973
Least you got
your sneakers and weed.


1291
01:00:31.611 --> 01:00:33.311
You think I don't care?

1292
01:00:33.313 --> 01:00:36.381
I got more at stake in this
than both of y'all.


1293
01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:39.017
What am I supposed to do,
huh, go in there with a bat


1294
01:00:39.019 --> 01:00:40.619
over uncle Leon's skull?

1295
01:00:40.621 --> 01:00:43.655
-What's that gonna get me?
-A broken bat, most likely.


1296
01:00:43.657 --> 01:00:45.457
He's-- he's pretty solid.

1297
01:00:45.459 --> 01:00:48.126
Look, Alicia,
I'm not backing down.


1298
01:00:48.128 --> 01:00:50.962
I just don't know
how to go forward either.


1299
01:01:00.473 --> 01:01:04.142
There they are!
I hope you don't mind.


1300
01:01:04.144 --> 01:01:07.913
I got in a few reps
while I was waiting.


1301
01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:10.649
So... what's it gonna be?

1302
01:01:10.651 --> 01:01:12.984
Money bags or a body bags?

1303
01:01:12.986 --> 01:01:15.387
W-well, definitely not
the body bags.


1304
01:01:15.389 --> 01:01:18.023
But, uh, we--
we ran into some problems.


1305
01:01:18.025 --> 01:01:19.658
Long s-- you don't
wanna hear the story.


1306
01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:21.660
But we don't have the money
right now, so...


1307
01:01:23.129 --> 01:01:25.130
No, no, no,
don't reach back there.


1308
01:01:25.132 --> 01:01:26.598
You don't need the gun.

1309
01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.534
-That is disappointing.
-Look, like I said before,


1310
01:01:29.536 --> 01:01:31.169
we tried to get the money,
and we failed.


1311
01:01:31.171 --> 01:01:33.071
You can't win 'em all,
am I right?


1312
01:01:33.073 --> 01:01:34.940
Relatable?
Put the gun down.


1313
01:01:34.942 --> 01:01:37.709
You know how many times
in my life I said "i tried"?


1314
01:01:37.711 --> 01:01:39.477
Say like maybe ten?
Ten, fifteen--?


1315
01:01:39.479 --> 01:01:41.646
Never!
Are you crazy?!


1316
01:01:41.648 --> 01:01:45.951
I got a mind to teach
your ass a lesson.


1317
01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:47.452
No, no lesson--
let's just teach--


1318
01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:50.989
ooh, don't touch my gun.
Don't ever touch my gun.


1319
01:01:50.991 --> 01:01:53.091
Okay, not touching the gun.
Just touching your finger.


1320
01:01:53.093 --> 01:01:55.026
Touching a gun's
like touching a man's dick.


1321
01:01:55.028 --> 01:01:56.995
-Don't touch my gun.
-He said it's his dick!


1322
01:01:56.997 --> 01:01:59.064
-I'm not touching the gun.
-You're touching the gun.


1323
01:02:02.736 --> 01:02:05.136
-Agh!
-He shot him!


1324
01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:07.405
I told you don't touch
the gun, man!


1325
01:02:07.407 --> 01:02:10.475
You kill us,
you not gonna get no money.


1326
01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:13.478
So let me go back to the house,
and let me get the money.


1327
01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.247
24 hours, that's all I need.

1328
01:02:16.249 --> 01:02:19.551
How do I know you ain't
gonna just gonna fuck up?


1329
01:02:19.553 --> 01:02:22.253
There goes my sandal game!

1330
01:02:22.255 --> 01:02:25.991
Do I look
like I'm gonna fuck up?


1331
01:02:25.993 --> 01:02:30.261
Ah, man, he ain't gonna fuck up.
He ain't gonna fuck up.


1332
01:02:30.263 --> 01:02:32.464
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1333
01:02:32.466 --> 01:02:35.000
You know what?

1334
01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:36.167
I believe you.

1335
01:02:36.169 --> 01:02:38.103
I believe you.

1336
01:02:38.105 --> 01:02:40.505
-Okay, whoa.
-You know what?


1337
01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:42.007
For the first time,

1338
01:02:42.009 --> 01:02:44.376
you actually look like
your father's son.


1339
01:02:44.378 --> 01:02:46.678
I'm proud of you.

1340
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:49.581
All right.
All right, motherfuckers!


1341
01:02:49.583 --> 01:02:53.585
- 24 hours for your ass!

1342
01:02:53.587 --> 01:02:57.188
And then I'm gonna come,
snatch up your mama,


1343
01:02:57.190 --> 01:03:01.126
and ride her sweet ass
outta here.


1344
01:03:01.128 --> 01:03:02.627
Come on with
the mama stuff, man.


1345
01:03:02.629 --> 01:03:06.364
-
-You all right?

1346
01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:07.799
I would be better
if I wasn't shot!


1347
01:03:07.801 --> 01:03:10.201
Juice, come on, man,

1348
01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:12.203
You got shot in your pinky toe,
acting like a bitch.


1349
01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:13.538
Shit hurt, okay?!

1350
01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:15.073
It's just a graze, come on.

1351
01:03:15.075 --> 01:03:16.441
About to lose a leg!

1352
01:03:16.443 --> 01:03:18.410
You're fine.
What's the play?


1353
01:03:18.412 --> 01:03:20.745
I don't know a play, okay?
You heard what he said.


1354
01:03:20.747 --> 01:03:22.814
If I don't have the money,
he's gonna come back,


1355
01:03:22.816 --> 01:03:24.783
he's gonna shoot us,
he's gonna go to the frat house


1356
01:03:24.785 --> 01:03:27.118
and kill everybody there,
what am I supposed to do?


1357
01:03:28.788 --> 01:03:30.121
I need some anesthesia.

1358
01:03:30.123 --> 01:03:31.389
You know what,
matter of fact,


1359
01:03:31.391 --> 01:03:33.658
shoot me in the head
like a horse, put me down.


1360
01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.428
Wait, wait, wait,
yeah, yeah, that's it.


1361
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:39.664
-No, no!
-No, no, no, not put<i>him</i> down.


1362
01:03:39.666 --> 01:03:42.200
Put him to sleep.
Can you get roofies?


1363
01:03:42.202 --> 01:03:44.669
What? You know what?
I'm insulted right now.


1364
01:03:44.671 --> 01:03:46.471
That you would think
that I'm the roofie guy.


1365
01:03:46.473 --> 01:03:48.306
Next time I need roofies,
I'll present it


1366
01:03:48.308 --> 01:03:50.341
in a more diplomatic way,
but for now,


1367
01:03:50.343 --> 01:03:53.078
can you get me roofies,
yes or no?


1368
01:03:54.146 --> 01:03:55.647
Yeah, of course.

1369
01:03:57.817 --> 01:04:04.389
Gentlemen, welcome to your
final night of pledge-ship.


1370
01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:10.662
I know this ain't been
an easy time for y'all.


1371
01:04:10.664 --> 01:04:15.100
Been especially hard
on some of you.


1372
01:04:15.102 --> 01:04:17.235
And we had to make it
hard on you


1373
01:04:17.237 --> 01:04:19.737
because what you're about
to step into is so great.


1374
01:04:19.739 --> 01:04:22.841
Brotherhood.

1375
01:04:22.843 --> 01:04:25.176
Built on loyalty...

1376
01:04:25.178 --> 01:04:28.646
Honesty... trust.

1377
01:04:28.648 --> 01:04:29.881
And booze and pussy.

1378
01:04:31.817 --> 01:04:34.419
I love these guys, man.

1379
01:04:36.288 --> 01:04:38.289
And now,
in the grand tradition


1380
01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:41.326
of our esteemed forefathers
who preceded us,


1381
01:04:41.328 --> 01:04:44.229
we will seal
the bond of brotherhood


1382
01:04:44.231 --> 01:04:46.631
through the drinking
of the ceremonial punch


1383
01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:50.869
consisting of grain alcohol,
store-brand fruit punch,


1384
01:04:50.871 --> 01:04:53.204
and a little bit
of liquid thc.


1385
01:04:55.908 --> 01:04:57.742
Who wants to step up?

1386
01:05:26.639 --> 01:05:28.873
To loyalty...

1387
01:05:28.875 --> 01:05:30.942
Trust...

1388
01:05:30.944 --> 01:05:32.577
And honesty.

1389
01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:54.232
With that, we'd like
to welcome you former shitbags


1390
01:05:54.234 --> 01:05:55.567
as our brothers.

1391
01:05:55.569 --> 01:05:57.468
Kappa Alpha chi for life!

1392
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:59.204
Kappa Alpha chi for life!

1393
01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:34.639
I think we might have
gone heavy


1394
01:06:34.641 --> 01:06:38.643
on the t... h...

1395
01:06:38.645 --> 01:06:39.944
C.

1396
01:06:47.486 --> 01:06:49.020
I think I'm good.

1397
01:07:00.899 --> 01:07:02.900
This escalator's broken.

1398
01:07:05.904 --> 01:07:08.273
That punch was strong.

1399
01:07:10.042 --> 01:07:11.643
Okay, um...

1400
01:07:11.645 --> 01:07:14.512
Work. Work.
Gotta get to work.


1401
01:07:14.514 --> 01:07:16.781
I don't know why.
I don't know why.


1402
01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:18.416
I don't know why.
I don't know why we--


1403
01:07:18.418 --> 01:07:19.751
we doing this.

1404
01:07:19.753 --> 01:07:23.354
Wait...
He's here's somewhere.


1405
01:07:23.356 --> 01:07:25.790
Ahh.

1406
01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:28.026
Sarah loves Russell.

1407
01:07:28.028 --> 01:07:30.295
Who the fuck is Russell!

1408
01:07:42.908 --> 01:07:45.910
<i>Money, listen,</i>
<i>I just wanna talk to you.</i>


1409
01:07:47.314 --> 01:07:49.047
What are you doing
down here, pledge?


1410
01:07:49.049 --> 01:07:52.550
-Don't you know who I am?
- Who the fuck are you?


1411
01:07:52.552 --> 01:07:55.987
You dumb son of a bitch.
I'm you, motherfucker.


1412
01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.889
Nigga, you me?

1413
01:07:57.891 --> 01:07:59.057
Go on now, hit that shit.

1414
01:07:59.059 --> 01:08:02.960
We in this together, huh?
Goddamn.


1415
01:08:07.466 --> 01:08:10.802
It's in the wall.
I'm looking in the wall!


1416
01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:15.973
You're right, Brock.
Dicks are funny.


1417
01:08:15.975 --> 01:08:20.111
Whoa, whoa, what are you
doing, del? Get back to work.


1418
01:08:20.113 --> 01:08:22.680
Hello? Where are you?

1419
01:08:26.385 --> 01:08:30.855
I will find you, money,
and I will spend you.


1420
01:08:56.081 --> 01:08:58.516
You son of a bitch.

1421
01:09:11.864 --> 01:09:13.564
Come on.

1422
01:09:24.076 --> 01:09:27.412
I got the money!
I got the money!


1423
01:09:27.414 --> 01:09:30.448
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1424
01:09:30.450 --> 01:09:32.417
I got the money!

1425
01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:34.819
I got the--

1426
01:09:34.821 --> 01:09:37.889
no, I got the money,
motherfucker!


1427
01:09:40.159 --> 01:09:41.993
<i>Where is he?</i>

1428
01:09:41.995 --> 01:09:44.929
-He should've been
back here by now.
-I don't know.


1429
01:09:44.931 --> 01:09:46.597
I can't really guesstimate
how long it takes


1430
01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:48.099
to knock out a room
full of white boys,


1431
01:09:48.101 --> 01:09:49.801
snatch a million dollars,
and drive all the way


1432
01:09:49.803 --> 01:09:51.536
to this neighborhood
in Thursday traffic.


1433
01:09:53.139 --> 01:09:55.106
Evening, dummies.

1434
01:09:58.477 --> 01:10:00.611
Here's the traitor.

1435
01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:07.151
What the fuck did you do,
buttersworth?!


1436
01:10:07.153 --> 01:10:08.986
I didn't do nothing!
I was knocked out!


1437
01:10:08.988 --> 01:10:11.222
We got roofied.
Everyone else is still out.


1438
01:10:11.224 --> 01:10:14.225
While we were out,
someone jacked all our shit!


1439
01:10:14.227 --> 01:10:16.027
Took our weed,
our cash, everything!


1440
01:10:16.029 --> 01:10:17.995
You doubted me about this,
then look what happened!


1441
01:10:17.997 --> 01:10:20.465
-I knew you were
up to something!
-I wasn't up to nothing.


1442
01:10:20.467 --> 01:10:21.866
You guys always talking
about brotherhood,


1443
01:10:21.868 --> 01:10:23.768
having each other's back
through thick and thin.


1444
01:10:23.770 --> 01:10:26.137
Something crazy happens,
this how y'all act?


1445
01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:28.473
Come on.

1446
01:10:28.475 --> 01:10:32.977
You're not my brother.
You're a fucking thief.


1447
01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:34.245
I'm not a thief.

1448
01:10:34.247 --> 01:10:36.514
I would never steal
y'all's shit.


1449
01:10:36.516 --> 01:10:38.182
But I think I know who did.

1450
01:10:38.184 --> 01:10:40.785
So what I'll do
is I'll go get it for y'all.


1451
01:10:40.787 --> 01:10:42.720
And I'll come right back,
'cause where I'm from,


1452
01:10:42.722 --> 01:10:45.256
that's what brothers do,
we have each other's back.


1453
01:10:45.258 --> 01:10:47.024
So just ease up.

1454
01:10:47.026 --> 01:10:50.027
Hey.
You're not going anywhere.


1455
01:10:52.664 --> 01:10:54.165
At least not by yourself.

1456
01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:56.501
A kappa Alpha chi brother
never stands alone,


1457
01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:58.169
so if you're going,
we're going.


1458
01:10:58.171 --> 01:10:59.670
Come on!

1459
01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:02.106
Well, that's great.
That's real cute.


1460
01:11:02.108 --> 01:11:05.176
I think I'm gonna handle
this one on my own.


1461
01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:07.745
You guys just chill here,
all right?


1462
01:11:07.747 --> 01:11:09.714
I don't think so,
buttersworth.


1463
01:11:09.716 --> 01:11:12.783
You don't have to do
anything on your own anymore.


1464
01:11:12.785 --> 01:11:14.986
You're kappa Alpha chi now.

1465
01:11:14.988 --> 01:11:17.154
You guys don't understand.
This guy is real.


1466
01:11:17.156 --> 01:11:20.258
Y'all just stay here and chill.
I got this.


1467
01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:21.259
Not a chance.

1468
01:11:21.261 --> 01:11:24.028
These guys are right.

1469
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:26.564
We got your back.

1470
01:11:26.566 --> 01:11:29.033
We're family now, right?

1471
01:11:31.103 --> 01:11:32.937
Kappa Alpha chi for life.

1472
01:11:32.939 --> 01:11:34.939
Kappa Alpha chi for life.

1473
01:11:34.941 --> 01:11:37.909
All right.
Kappa Alpha chi for life.


1474
01:11:40.947 --> 01:11:43.548
You know there's, like,
a bunch of dicks on your face?


1475
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:47.585
-Like a bunch.
-Yeah, there's a lot of 'em.


1476
01:11:47.587 --> 01:11:50.288
98...

1477
01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:52.323
Ooh...

1478
01:11:54.626 --> 01:11:56.160
100.
Now, now, Berta.


1479
01:11:58.196 --> 01:12:00.598
I got a lot of money here.

1480
01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.767
I can make you happy.

1481
01:12:02.769 --> 01:12:05.336
I'll get you anything
you want.


1482
01:12:05.338 --> 01:12:08.272
We'll make a life together.

1483
01:12:08.274 --> 01:12:10.608
I don't want
your dirty money, Leon.


1484
01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:12.209
I'm fine with my life
just as it is.


1485
01:12:12.211 --> 01:12:15.279
We just got the phone back on.
Thinking about a second line.


1486
01:12:15.281 --> 01:12:16.847
Where's my son?

1487
01:12:16.849 --> 01:12:21.686
Woman, how am I gonna focus
on getting up in that pussy


1488
01:12:21.688 --> 01:12:24.355
when all you can talk about
is what came out of it?


1489
01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:27.191
I think I can get us
out of here.


1490
01:12:27.193 --> 01:12:28.359
Go ahead, you got that?

1491
01:12:28.361 --> 01:12:30.661
Oh, you got soft hands.
I never noticed.


1492
01:12:30.663 --> 01:12:31.929
You shut up.
You shut up.


1493
01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:34.165
You shut up.
You shut the fuck up.


1494
01:12:36.234 --> 01:12:38.369
You guys hang out
by the back door
and wait for the signal.


1495
01:12:38.371 --> 01:12:40.071
Okay, yeah, totally.

1496
01:12:40.073 --> 01:12:42.006
Yeah, what's
the signal, though?


1497
01:12:42.008 --> 01:12:44.208
Bro, I told you,
it's "man."


1498
01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:45.977
-Man. Man.
-Man. Man.


1499
01:12:45.979 --> 01:12:48.646
-Like-- like, "man!"
-Man. Man.


1500
01:12:53.752 --> 01:12:57.388
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1501
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:59.056
Fuck you, Berta!

1502
01:12:59.058 --> 01:13:02.360
You just missed out
on the greatest dick
you ever known!


1503
01:13:05.163 --> 01:13:07.732
Um, black Mr. clean!

1504
01:13:07.734 --> 01:13:11.002
I heard 'roids
make your dick small!


1505
01:13:11.004 --> 01:13:13.337
What the fuck
did you just say to me?


1506
01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:14.941
Uh--

1507
01:13:14.941 --> 01:13:19.043
you and this bitch
are just lucky to be alive!


1508
01:13:19.045 --> 01:13:21.779
Oh, you gonna be sorry
you said that.


1509
01:13:21.781 --> 01:13:23.347
We-- we-- we cool.
It's cool.


1510
01:13:23.349 --> 01:13:25.383
I'm sorry.
I apologize.


1511
01:13:25.385 --> 01:13:27.952
Get your ass back!

1512
01:13:27.954 --> 01:13:30.321
Motherfuckers
have tried and died


1513
01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:33.157
sneaking up on Leon goodlow!

1514
01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:34.992
You make out
anything he's saying?


1515
01:13:34.994 --> 01:13:38.863
Sounds like when
a chick's telling you
about her childhood


1516
01:13:38.865 --> 01:13:41.399
while she's eating out
your asshole.


1517
01:13:41.401 --> 01:13:42.900
Dude.

1518
01:13:42.902 --> 01:13:45.169
That is exactly
what it sounds like.


1519
01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:46.704
Oh, shit.

1520
01:13:46.706 --> 01:13:49.340
- Everybody likes butt stuff.

1521
01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:53.077
You still have balls
on your chin.


1522
01:13:53.079 --> 01:13:54.445
What the fuck
are you doing?!


1523
01:13:54.447 --> 01:13:58.182
Okay, okay, Leon. Leon!

1524
01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:00.751
Just put the crowbar down
and I will come with you.


1525
01:14:00.753 --> 01:14:02.353
Leave del out of this.
Del, step aside.


1526
01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:07.124
No, mom, I got this, all right?
Time for me to stand my ground.


1527
01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:11.195
I said it's time I be a man!

1528
01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.300
I-it's time I be a man!

1529
01:14:20.405 --> 01:14:22.740
Be a man then. What?

1530
01:14:22.742 --> 01:14:24.709
I said it's time
for me to a man!


1531
01:14:24.711 --> 01:14:26.143
Right now!!

1532
01:14:26.145 --> 01:14:28.145
Bro, did you see that video
that said that Tupac


1533
01:14:28.147 --> 01:14:30.147
is alive and working
with the illuminati?


1534
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:32.249
-Aaliyah and left eye, too.
-Yeah, and it's all true.


1535
01:14:32.251 --> 01:14:33.951
It's right there
on the Internet.


1536
01:14:33.953 --> 01:14:35.352
It's like they're not
even trying to cover it up.


1537
01:14:35.354 --> 01:14:38.055
Wait, wait, wait.
You guys hear that?


1538
01:14:40.225 --> 01:14:42.460
-
-Yo, that sounds like a gat.

1539
01:14:42.462 --> 01:14:44.095
Good ears, dawg.

1540
01:14:44.097 --> 01:14:46.430
It's time for me to be a man!

1541
01:14:46.432 --> 01:14:49.867
I need to be a m-a-a-an!!

1542
01:14:49.869 --> 01:14:52.069
Baby,
are you having a stroke?


1543
01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:54.371
Come on, man,
please don't rob us again.


1544
01:14:54.373 --> 01:14:56.173
My dad was on the phone
with the bank for hours


1545
01:14:56.175 --> 01:14:58.275
getting new credit cards,
hassle factor's--


1546
01:14:58.277 --> 01:15:00.911
-do I look like I fucking care?
-No.


1547
01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:02.913
I warned y'all
not to come back here.


1548
01:15:02.915 --> 01:15:04.448
Y--

1549
01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:06.484
I got this.

1550
01:15:06.486 --> 01:15:08.519
Well...

1551
01:15:08.521 --> 01:15:11.021
You wanna be a man.

1552
01:15:11.023 --> 01:15:14.525
All I see is a little boy
about to piss himself.


1553
01:15:16.863 --> 01:15:18.829
Get your ass over there.

1554
01:15:18.831 --> 01:15:21.432
You trying to play me?!
You trying to play me?!


1555
01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:24.335
Hey,
call your boy off, man!


1556
01:15:24.337 --> 01:15:26.003
We know we were supposed
to wait for your signal


1557
01:15:26.005 --> 01:15:28.205
to come and help you,
but we couldn't hear


1558
01:15:28.207 --> 01:15:31.208
your signal,
and now we need help. Oh--


1559
01:15:31.210 --> 01:15:33.778
hold on, hold on.
Is that him?


1560
01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:36.213
Is that the fucker
that took our shit?


1561
01:15:36.215 --> 01:15:39.216
-He's huge!
-Show some respect,
little homie.


1562
01:15:39.218 --> 01:15:42.820
That is Leon goodlow, son.
Ghetto legend.


1563
01:15:42.822 --> 01:15:45.156
Hood hall of fame,
motherfucker!


1564
01:15:45.158 --> 01:15:47.491
This thug right here
is a-no good low-life


1565
01:15:47.493 --> 01:15:50.528
and he's the type
that I do not
associate myself with.


1566
01:15:50.530 --> 01:15:54.165
Don't associate with?

1567
01:15:54.167 --> 01:15:56.433
Ask yourself if you've ever
seen your friend here


1568
01:15:56.435 --> 01:15:59.236
in class or doing homework?

1569
01:15:59.238 --> 01:16:01.138
I maintain a solid gpa.

1570
01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.340
What I do on my own time
is my own business, thank you.


1571
01:16:03.342 --> 01:16:06.477
On your own time?
Snooping around their basement?


1572
01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:08.512
I'm kappa Alpha chi,
motherfucker, what's good?!


1573
01:16:08.514 --> 01:16:09.580
Kappa Alpha chi!

1574
01:16:09.582 --> 01:16:11.949
Tell them
who the fuck you are!


1575
01:16:11.951 --> 01:16:13.384
Okay, you got the gun
right there.


1576
01:16:13.386 --> 01:16:16.520
Guys, just real quick.
I'm-a keep it 100 with you.


1577
01:16:16.522 --> 01:16:18.455
My real name
is del goodlow, okay?


1578
01:16:18.457 --> 01:16:20.825
I'm not a college student.
I lied about that.


1579
01:16:20.827 --> 01:16:23.828
I just did it so I could get
into your frat


1580
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:25.563
and take the money
that my uncle and father


1581
01:16:25.565 --> 01:16:30.234
stashed there years ago,
so that's the whole truth.


1582
01:16:34.072 --> 01:16:37.474
Oh, my god! I told you!
I told you!


1583
01:16:37.476 --> 01:16:41.478
I to-o-ld you!
I told you! I told you!


1584
01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:44.481
I told you, like,
six times this that n-n--


1585
01:16:44.483 --> 01:16:48.452
new... guy
was up to something!


1586
01:16:48.454 --> 01:16:52.022
Yes, okay,
obviously he looks exactly


1587
01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:54.124
like that fire inspector
who came to our house,


1588
01:16:54.126 --> 01:16:56.260
but I couldn't say that then!

1589
01:16:56.262 --> 01:16:58.529
And, yes, it does seem
a little fishy in retrospect


1590
01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:00.598
that he kept offering
to remodel our basement.


1591
01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.567
I bet you're not even
a licensed contractor.


1592
01:17:03.569 --> 01:17:05.536
No, I'm not.

1593
01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:07.972
You're an asshole.

1594
01:17:07.974 --> 01:17:12.610
How much money we talking
about here, del?


1595
01:17:12.612 --> 01:17:14.111
Ain't no big deal.

1596
01:17:14.113 --> 01:17:16.447
Just a little something
left over from an old job.


1597
01:17:16.449 --> 01:17:17.648
A little money?

1598
01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:20.584
That's a million dollars
in there!


1599
01:17:20.586 --> 01:17:23.954
-Right?
-Nigga, a million dollars?!


1600
01:17:23.956 --> 01:17:26.156
I thought you didn't want
no dirty money!


1601
01:17:26.158 --> 01:17:28.659
Shit, my morals
start get real flexible


1602
01:17:28.661 --> 01:17:30.261
around the mid-six figures.

1603
01:17:30.263 --> 01:17:32.563
You know,
legally speaking,


1604
01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:34.965
depending on how long
that's been in our basement,


1605
01:17:34.967 --> 01:17:37.401
we may technically own it
thanks to something


1606
01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:39.303
called adverse possession.

1607
01:17:39.305 --> 01:17:44.041
Lucky for me, I don't give
a shit about the law.


1608
01:17:44.043 --> 01:17:47.278
-Okay.
-So give me the fuckin' money.


1609
01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.915
Whatever happened to me
being a ghetto legend?


1610
01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:52.483
Still true.

1611
01:17:52.485 --> 01:17:54.351
But...

1612
01:17:54.353 --> 01:17:55.986
Million dollars, bro.

1613
01:17:55.988 --> 01:17:58.656
Not to mention the shine
my reputation gonna get


1614
01:17:58.658 --> 01:18:02.693
if I take out a bad-ass
motherfucker like yourself.


1615
01:18:02.695 --> 01:18:04.962
I respect that.

1616
01:18:04.964 --> 01:18:07.665
But you ain't
getting that shit.
I earned that.


1617
01:18:07.667 --> 01:18:09.266
However...

1618
01:18:11.503 --> 01:18:14.004
I think you might enjoy
the contents of that bag.


1619
01:18:14.006 --> 01:18:16.340
Just some odds and ends
i managed


1620
01:18:16.342 --> 01:18:19.109
to relieve
these boys of earlier.


1621
01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:20.978
Get about 20 gs
for that shit.


1622
01:18:26.318 --> 01:18:30.487
That's real nice of you, Leon.
Real nice.


1623
01:18:30.489 --> 01:18:32.456
Be even nicer, though,
if you just...


1624
01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:35.960
Handed over the rest now,
too, hmm?


1625
01:18:35.962 --> 01:18:38.662
Ooh-ee!

1626
01:18:38.664 --> 01:18:44.068
Oh, look like you got us
in a mess now, del, huh?!


1627
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:46.170
Ain't nobody leaving
this motherfucker


1628
01:18:46.172 --> 01:18:49.273
until there's some blood
on the floor!


1629
01:18:49.275 --> 01:18:53.177
Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


1630
01:18:53.179 --> 01:18:54.745
I'm sorry to everyone.

1631
01:18:54.747 --> 01:18:57.514
I know you guys are pissed,
and you got every reason to be.


1632
01:18:57.516 --> 01:18:59.616
But you gotta understand
why I did what I did.


1633
01:18:59.618 --> 01:19:01.352
Okay, I did it
for my moms.


1634
01:19:01.354 --> 01:19:03.988
I did it to help
save this place.


1635
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:07.458
Uncle Leon, come on, man,
remember when you and my dad


1636
01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:11.128
helped start this gym,
remember how proud you were,


1637
01:19:11.130 --> 01:19:13.731
how proud you were to get
these kids off the streets?


1638
01:19:13.733 --> 01:19:15.232
Turned my life around.

1639
01:19:18.603 --> 01:19:20.771
And guys, I'll admit
when I first met y'all,


1640
01:19:20.773 --> 01:19:24.274
I thought you were
a bunch of overprivileged
ignorant assholes


1641
01:19:24.276 --> 01:19:26.477
with tiny hands standing
between me and what I needed.


1642
01:19:26.479 --> 01:19:30.647
But I misjudged y'all.
Y'all are family.


1643
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:32.149
Y'all are brothers.

1644
01:19:32.151 --> 01:19:33.450
I really believe
what Brock said earlier.


1645
01:19:33.452 --> 01:19:35.185
Family has
each other's back,


1646
01:19:35.187 --> 01:19:38.789
no matter what,
even if they fuck up.


1647
01:19:38.791 --> 01:19:41.325
Whether that family name
is kappa Alpha chi...


1648
01:19:41.327 --> 01:19:43.560
Kappa Alpha chi.

1649
01:19:46.331 --> 01:19:47.798
...or goodlow.

1650
01:19:50.368 --> 01:19:51.769
Fuck you, del.

1651
01:19:51.771 --> 01:19:55.572
Ain't no sentimental
conflict resolution bullshit


1652

Well, fuck you, too then!

1654
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:07.684
Agh! Shot me in the ass!

1655
01:20:07.686 --> 01:20:10.120
Shut up!
Barely grazed your ass.


1656
01:20:10.122 --> 01:20:12.156
Oh, it hurts.
It hurts.


1657
01:20:12.158 --> 01:20:14.725
-I told you it hurts.
- Ooh!


1658
01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:16.160
Enough!

1659
01:20:19.431 --> 01:20:20.831
You know what, del,

1660
01:20:20.833 --> 01:20:24.468
when I found out
your father had told you


1661
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:27.404
about the money,
my first thought--


1662
01:20:27.406 --> 01:20:29.406
oh, shit!

1663
01:20:39.784 --> 01:20:42.553
Goddamn it, del!

1664
01:20:42.555 --> 01:20:43.821
How many times
did I tell you to fix


1665
01:20:43.823 --> 01:20:46.156
the motherfucking
air conditioner?!


1666
01:20:47.659 --> 01:20:50.094
Whoo!

1667
01:20:50.096 --> 01:20:53.430
<i>Good things do happen</i>
<i>in the hood.</i>


1668
01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:55.332
<i>My moms got to keep</i>
<i>the gym, baby,</i>


1669
01:20:55.334 --> 01:20:57.668

1670
01:20:57.670 --> 01:21:01.472
Here you go, boys.
Sorry about the basement.

<i>So now we got a family</i>

1674
01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:11.882

your workman's comp


1675
01:21:11.884 --> 01:21:13.617
doesn't cover
stupid, right?


1676
01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:17.254
Why did you climb a ladder
so that you could bend down?


1677
01:21:17.256 --> 01:21:21.158
-Oh, what up, neighbor?
-What up!


1678

We need to get that back.

1686
01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:44.581

-
-Hello?

1693
01:21:58.764 --> 01:22:01.865
Feels good to give back
to the community, doesn't it?


1694
01:22:01.867 --> 01:22:02.866
Fo' sho'.

Why don't you start

I deserve that.

Make that happen.

1699
01:22:13.312 --> 01:22:15.846
<i>Oh, and one last thing.</i>

1700
01:22:15.848 --> 01:22:19.883
Wow, they came back alive
and fully conscious.


1701
01:22:19.885 --> 01:22:23.554
If you think that's
impressive...


1702
01:22:26.524 --> 01:22:28.592
Del!
Stop macking on the staff


1703
01:22:28.594 --> 01:22:30.694
and install
the new air conditioner.


1704
01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.763
I gotta go to class
in, like, 30 minutes.


1705
01:22:32.765 --> 01:22:33.797
Just have juice do it.

01:22:35.801 --> 01:22:36.833
Damn.

1708
01:22:36.835 --> 01:22:39.970
You ain't strong,
college man.


1709
01:22:41.573 --> 01:22:42.806
Yo, yo!

1710
01:22:42.808 --> 01:22:47.477
Just tap out if you want
a real man to step in.


1711
01:22:47.479 --> 01:22:49.513
Mind your business, Reggie!

1712
01:22:49.515 --> 01:22:52.216
-You think this is?
-Your loss.


1713
01:22:54.986 --> 01:22:55.919
Oh!

1714
01:23:15.474 --> 01:23:18.809
Man, bach, we don't win
a kids choice award,


1715
01:23:18.811 --> 01:23:21.712
this is some bullshit.

1716
01:23:21.714 --> 01:23:25.249
Y'all just gonna let him
kick me in my ass?


1717
01:23:25.251 --> 01:23:28.585
Fucking time capsule!

1718
01:23:28.587 --> 01:23:30.954
Is that too much?
Did I overdo it?


1719
01:23:30.956 --> 01:23:33.957
My boy!

1720
01:23:33.959 --> 01:23:36.493
Don't fucking fall asleep on me
when I'm sitting here


1721
01:23:36.495 --> 01:23:39.663
trying to be a Mr. Rogers
or a Dr. Phil.


1722
01:23:39.665 --> 01:23:41.565
And I don't know what you
keep looking up


1723
01:23:41.567 --> 01:23:43.867
at that big St. Bernard for.
He only want a donut.


1724
01:23:43.869 --> 01:23:45.269
I can smack him
upside the head


1725
01:23:45.271 --> 01:23:46.536
and throw a donut
on the ground.


1726
01:23:46.538 --> 01:23:50.274
-What you think he gonna go for?
-He gonna go for the donut.


1727
01:23:50.276 --> 01:23:51.642
The motherfuckin' donut.

1728
01:23:51.644 --> 01:23:52.876
I think I have it.

1729
01:23:52.878 --> 01:23:55.012
Okay, she got it.

1730
01:23:55.014 --> 01:23:57.681
No, I don't.
