1
00:00:15.592 --> 00:00:17.791
You're tuned to Bludso on the radio.

2
00:00:17.803 --> 00:00:21.503
Stage one of my dramatic transformation
is almost complete.


3
00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:24.547
Oh, my God. You're such a child.

4
00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:28.635
Well, I'm an actual child, so...

5
00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:30.732
How is that an insult?

6
00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:35.445
It just means it's working.

7
00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:39.354
Girls, we're home!

8
00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.911
Listeners, the music
will be right back after a quick break.


9
00:00:46.498 --> 00:00:49.459
Fine, but don't get mad when
you're just as nappy as you ever were.


10
00:00:53.422 --> 00:00:56.705
- Come on, Linda!
- I'm right here!


11
00:01:01.138 --> 00:01:04.337
Ow! Linda!

12
00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.214
Oh! Aah!

13
00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:09.509
Calm down.
I'm putting the neutralizer in now.


14
00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:11.803
Hurry up. It really hurts!

15
00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:13.179
Hold on.

16
00:01:14.568 --> 00:01:17.058
Anna, you've been with
our family for a year.


17
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.019
This is way past due.

18
00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:21.938
You might could pass
as my sister, after all.


19
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.773
Should it still burn?

20
00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:25.358
Linda!

21
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.277
Hey, what... What's going on up there?

22
00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:28.957
That hurts.

23
00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:30.322
Linda?

24
00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:32.586
I did what the box told me.

25
00:01:34.421 --> 00:01:37.037
I did what the box told me.

26
00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.425
Girls!

27
00:01:39.634 --> 00:01:40.957
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:42.625
I didn't mean to!

29
00:01:42.637 --> 00:01:44.085
- Hey, what's going on up there?
- It was the box!


30
00:01:44.097 --> 00:01:46.421
I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do it!

31
00:02:57.254 --> 00:02:58.422
Ow.

32
00:03:14.146 --> 00:03:17.566
The call was for
a Downtown Julie Brown type.


33
00:03:18.108 --> 00:03:21.266
Someone worldly, articulate,

34
00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:23.655
knowledgeable, charismatic?

35
00:03:25.365 --> 00:03:26.813
Black?

36
00:03:29.077 --> 00:03:32.402
Assistant at Culture for four years.

37
00:03:32.414 --> 00:03:34.487
- Uh-huh.
- They never gave you a shot?


38
00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:36.793
Only so many spots in Culture.

39
00:03:37.753 --> 00:03:43.163
Um, we just need a little bit more
rock than urban here.


40
00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:44.664
Perfect.

41
00:03:44.676 --> 00:03:48.293
I appeal to a global audience,
you know?


42
00:03:48.305 --> 00:03:53.173
"It's Anna Bludso, coming at you
with the hottest of the hot."


43
00:03:53.185 --> 00:03:54.436
Thank you so much.

44
00:04:23.799 --> 00:04:26.748
RMV. Rock Music Video.

45
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.502
The only place that will rock you.
You know you want it.


46
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:40.387
- Oh!
- Hey. All right.


47
00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:44.349
She doesn't work here,
does she?


48
00:04:56.873 --> 00:04:59.376
From the people
that brought you RMV,


49
00:05:00.085 --> 00:05:02.242
we are Culture.

50
00:05:02.254 --> 00:05:04.911
Featuring Brook
-Lynne, Sista Soul,

51
00:05:04.923 --> 00:05:06.705
and Julius.

52
00:05:06.717 --> 00:05:09.803
Culture. We're coming on for you.

53
00:05:22.816 --> 00:05:24.931
Damn it.

54
00:05:24.943 --> 00:05:26.349
All right, big board meeting.

55
00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:28.143
You're all called here.
You know something's up.


56
00:05:28.155 --> 00:05:30.687
And I'm not gonna bullshit you.
Do you know what Culture is


57
00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.814
to the suits downstairs?

58
00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:34.286
It's a liability.

59
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.696
It's in place only so that
Yetnikoff at CBS and Clive Davis at Arista


60
00:05:39.708 --> 00:05:43.670
don't sue RMV's asses
for not playing "that black disco shit."


61
00:05:44.212 --> 00:05:45.630
Their words.

62
00:05:46.506 --> 00:05:48.163
I'd love to tell you
the board put me here

63
00:05:48.175 --> 00:05:49.497
because they think I'm
some kind of wunderkind,


64
00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.208
but the truth is, anytime they see
an executive with a hairline


65
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.419
and a working dick, they think
he's not qualified to do shit,


66
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:56.183
except babysit a loss leader.

67
00:05:58.226 --> 00:05:59.853
But let me tell you something.

68
00:06:01.104 --> 00:06:03.023
This is exactly where I want to be.

69
00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:07.724
I spent my entire summer at the Apollo,
kicking it with Teddy Riley,


70
00:06:07.736 --> 00:06:09.684
Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

71
00:06:09.696 --> 00:06:13.909
Hip hop? This New Jack shit?

72
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.858
It's the future.

73
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.109
And not just black music.

74
00:06:18.121 --> 00:06:20.070
It's the future of the
entire music industry.


75
00:06:20.082 --> 00:06:21.571
And we have a chance to own it.

76
00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:23.823
Look at Julius' whack-ass fade.

77
00:06:23.835 --> 00:06:25.784
- He's cute.
- Is not.


78
00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:29.037
- Nigga think he Eddie Murphy.
- Shut up!


79
00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:31.289
- She ain't wrong.
- Which is why Edna


80
00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:33.875
has decided to step down
as EVP of programming.


81
00:06:33.887 --> 00:06:35.752
- Wait, what?
- Edna!


82
00:06:35.764 --> 00:06:40.048
- Hell, no.
- Culture needs to grow in a direction I simply cannot take it.


83
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.343
- It's okay. It's totally admirable.
- She said she was gonna give me a raise.


84
00:06:43.355 --> 00:06:45.887
- Well, that's out.
- I begged her to stay.


85
00:06:45.899 --> 00:06:49.057
But I'm confident
we're in excellent hands.


86
00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:51.476
Allow me to introduce your new EVP:

87
00:06:51.488 --> 00:06:53.645
The legendary Zora Choice.

88
00:06:53.657 --> 00:06:57.399
- Thank you, Grant.
Now, I know what you're all thinking.


89
00:06:57.411 --> 00:07:00.110
They say I'm the world's first
black supermodel.


90
00:07:00.122 --> 00:07:01.820
Of course it's a light-skinned bitch.

91
00:07:01.832 --> 00:07:02.946
And what does a...

92
00:07:02.958 --> 00:07:05.115
An aging supermodel
know about running a channel?


93
00:07:05.127 --> 00:07:09.369
Well, I've been quietly inching my way
toward this goal for quite some time now.


94
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:14.040
And rest assured, I will be consulting
the brilliant Edna Knight


95
00:07:14.052 --> 00:07:16.042
- as long as she'll have me.
- Absolutely.


96
00:07:16.054 --> 00:07:18.086
Programming will be suspended

97
00:07:18.098 --> 00:07:21.047
for a few weeks while we are retooling.

98
00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:24.092
I, I know it seems sudden,
but we simply must.


99
00:07:24.104 --> 00:07:28.346
If Cult, and that's what we're calling it,
by the way,


100
00:07:28.358 --> 00:07:32.392
if Cult is going to be the authority
on pop culture in the '90s,


101
00:07:32.404 --> 00:07:35.103
well, we simply must be sure
of its direction.


102
00:07:35.115 --> 00:07:38.565
My assistant Rosalyn will be
setting up meetings with all of you,


103
00:07:38.577 --> 00:07:39.983
just to get to know you,

104
00:07:39.995 --> 00:07:43.194
and find out what skills
you will bring to Cult.


105
00:07:43.206 --> 00:07:45.780
"The Block" continues to do
well enough in the ratings.


106
00:07:45.792 --> 00:07:50.785
Especially with our very exciting and
contractually obligated Sandra premiere.


107
00:07:50.797 --> 00:07:53.371
That program will continue
as scheduled.


108
00:07:53.383 --> 00:07:57.167
If this succeeds,
we change popular culture.


109
00:07:57.179 --> 00:07:58.877
Y'all, we are doomed.

110
00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:00.420
Come on, there's gotta be
something we can do.


111
00:08:00.432 --> 00:08:01.838
Edna, this is your channel.

112
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.716
- Look, I just bought a condo, okay?
I'm not going back to radio.


113
00:08:04.728 --> 00:08:07.552
Edna, she brought her own assistant!

114
00:08:07.564 --> 00:08:10.847
Okay, look, I'm gonna start
my own production company


115
00:08:10.859 --> 00:08:13.558
that's programming for us, by us.

116
00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.810
Now, it's gonna take
a few months to get started,


117
00:08:15.822 --> 00:08:18.688
but I will be calling you all, okay?

118
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.662
And then maybe we can work for
somebody other than them.


119
00:08:24.164 --> 00:08:26.404
Uh, I'll be waiting by the phone.

120
00:08:26.416 --> 00:08:29.658
It's your man Julius,
and welcome to The Block,


121
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:34.120
where we got a bangin' exclusive
from the princess of pop soul.


122
00:08:34.132 --> 00:08:36.164
It's already on the Billboard top 10,

123
00:08:36.176 --> 00:08:39.459
- and has its sights on number one.
- Excuse me, excuse me. Thank you.


124
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:41.670
Thank you so... I'm so sorry I'm late,
guys. Beauty takes time.


125
00:08:41.682 --> 00:08:43.630
Anna better not be
still hooking up with him.


126
00:08:43.642 --> 00:08:45.382
You know Anna
don't live in the real world.


127
00:08:45.394 --> 00:08:47.258
- Oh, hey, Anna.
- Thanks for proofing, girl.


128
00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.220
- No problem.
- ...four, three, two,


129
00:08:50.232 --> 00:08:51.846
Hey, it's your man, Julius,

130
00:08:51.858 --> 00:08:53.682
and welcome to The Block,

131
00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:56.559
where we got a bangin' exclusive
from the princess of pop soul...


132
00:08:56.571 --> 00:08:58.103
"I Get It!"

133
00:08:58.115 --> 00:08:59.366
I said...

134
00:09:25.142 --> 00:09:27.048
Is that a new nose?

135
00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:28.508
Contouring.

136
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.605
And contacts, maybe?

137
00:09:38.572 --> 00:09:40.520
Oh, that thing must be glued down.

138
00:09:40.532 --> 00:09:42.772
Or a really good relaxer, maybe.

139
00:09:42.784 --> 00:09:45.358
Mm-mm, my shit don't move like that,
and I'm part Cherokee.


140
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.360
It's a weave, I think.

141
00:09:47.372 --> 00:09:50.447
Yeah, my girl Tanitra
just started doing those.


142
00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:52.782
Take whatever hair you want
and sew it into your real hair.


143
00:09:52.794 --> 00:09:55.827
- Ugh, that sounds painful.
And expensive.


144
00:09:55.839 --> 00:09:58.204
It actually sounds like a good idea.

145
00:09:58.216 --> 00:10:00.749
Guess it's better than
a creamy crack, right?


146
00:10:00.761 --> 00:10:03.293
Of course,
I know what's better than either.


147
00:10:03.305 --> 00:10:06.504
- Okay, Sojourner Truth.
Ain't nobody got time for all that upkeep.


148
00:10:06.516 --> 00:10:09.227
- Really, dookie braids?
- It didn't take that long.


149
00:10:33.877 --> 00:10:36.117
Hell, I think I need me a cigarette.

150
00:10:36.129 --> 00:10:37.452
I think I need a weave.

151
00:10:37.464 --> 00:10:39.079
How anyone can sew someone else's

152
00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:41.039
dead energy into their head is beyond me.

153
00:10:41.051 --> 00:10:43.583
You see shorty's hair?

154
00:10:43.595 --> 00:10:45.418
I get it, okay?

155
00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.058
Aah.

156
00:10:56.775 --> 00:10:58.068
Ahem.

157
00:10:59.152 --> 00:11:01.196
- Crazy day.
- Humph.


158
00:11:04.491 --> 00:11:08.525
So, what are you doing tonight?

159
00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:10.610
You know,

160
00:11:10.622 --> 00:11:13.417
I've been seeing someone.

161
00:11:16.253 --> 00:11:17.963
You heard me. Hmm?

162
00:11:18.588 --> 00:11:22.539
Like, a therapist, or...

163
00:11:22.551 --> 00:11:26.209
I know I've crossed some lines.

164
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:29.045
Turned us into something
we should have never been.


165
00:11:29.057 --> 00:11:31.798
We've been crossing a line for years.

166
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:32.936
Fresh!

167
00:11:34.187 --> 00:11:36.857
You know, I'll take
full responsibility for it.


168
00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:40.777
We crossed the line this afternoon
in your dressing room!


169
00:11:42.154 --> 00:11:43.947
But you pushed for that, though.

170
00:11:44.531 --> 00:11:45.741
I am sorry.

171
00:11:46.491 --> 00:11:49.745
It's, it's been killing me, though.
All right?


172
00:11:50.162 --> 00:11:51.330
Has it?

173
00:11:57.044 --> 00:12:00.005
Anna! We need you now!

174
00:12:02.049 --> 00:12:03.371
Coming!

175
00:12:05.218 --> 00:12:07.500
Jesus.

176
00:12:12.309 --> 00:12:14.049
Anna, you all right, girl?

177
00:12:14.061 --> 00:12:16.051
Yeah, just...

178
00:12:16.063 --> 00:12:19.179
these cramps, and this,
this damned machine.


179
00:12:19.191 --> 00:12:21.014
Oh, just ask.

180
00:12:21.026 --> 00:12:23.320
You know we are
all synced up in here.

181
00:12:26.698 --> 00:12:27.866
Hey.

182
00:12:28.909 --> 00:12:30.285
You'll be all right.

183
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.942
Why would they get rid of you?

184
00:12:33.997 --> 00:12:36.333
You barely cost the network anything.

185
00:13:19.042 --> 00:13:20.627
You ever have a dream...

186
00:13:22.087 --> 00:13:23.422
Something...

187
00:13:25.173 --> 00:13:27.163
you would do anything for?

188
00:13:27.175 --> 00:13:29.636
Especially when someone says...

189
00:13:30.637 --> 00:13:32.377
you can't do it.

190
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:34.462
You don't deserve it.

191
00:13:34.474 --> 00:13:36.226
You were that dream for me.

192
00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:40.051
No. Your career was your dream.

193
00:13:40.063 --> 00:13:43.442
Just know that I will always love you.

194
00:13:44.443 --> 00:13:46.266
My lovin'.

195
00:13:46.278 --> 00:13:47.779
You're never gotta get it.

196
00:13:49.823 --> 00:13:51.521
That was amazing.

197
00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:54.190
Sandra, oh, my gosh.
She's so sexy. So beautiful.


198
00:13:54.202 --> 00:13:57.402
Listen, I'm your man, Julius.
And I'm gonna be here,


199
00:13:57.414 --> 00:13:59.946
you know, I got some stuff
to really put you in the mood.


200
00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:02.949
Get your candy box going, ladies.
Put a little bit of sugar in there.


201
00:14:02.961 --> 00:14:06.453
I got everything that you need.
That's right. Everything right here.


202
00:14:06.465 --> 00:14:08.079
Right here. You know.

203
00:14:08.091 --> 00:14:10.373
I love using
this time to talk to the ladies,


204
00:14:10.385 --> 00:14:12.083
because you all buy tickets to things,

205
00:14:12.095 --> 00:14:15.545
so y'all know where I'm gonna be at.
I'm gonna be DJing downtown...


206
00:14:15.557 --> 00:14:16.713
You're ten days late!

207
00:14:16.725 --> 00:14:18.727
Don't think I won't
kick your ass out of here!


208
00:14:28.236 --> 00:14:29.571
God damn it.

209
00:14:30.864 --> 00:14:32.741
All right, I'll be back tomorrow.

210
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:48.298
I thought she was just
getting to know us.


211
00:14:51.468 --> 00:14:53.178
Hey girl, how you holdin' up?

212
00:15:00.894 --> 00:15:03.397
Anna? Zora will see you now.

213
00:15:17.411 --> 00:15:22.153
Girl to girl, this isn't a chat.
It's an interview. Understand?


214
00:15:22.165 --> 00:15:24.126
I'm getting the picture.

215
00:15:32.926 --> 00:15:36.042
So, you were Edna's assistant, no?

216
00:15:36.054 --> 00:15:38.795
I mean, I'm sure
you're much more than that.


217
00:15:38.807 --> 00:15:40.547
You've been here forever.

218
00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:42.561
But that was your title.

219
00:15:43.228 --> 00:15:45.051
Yes.

220
00:15:45.063 --> 00:15:49.597
Edna was very concerned
about her dear Anna.


221
00:15:49.609 --> 00:15:51.486
She never got you promoted?

222
00:15:51.987 --> 00:15:54.227
It almost happened.

223
00:15:54.239 --> 00:15:56.813
After I came up with The Block,
Edna said...


224
00:15:56.825 --> 00:15:58.648
You came up with The Block?

225
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.110
I wanted to produce, and host, but...

226
00:16:02.122 --> 00:16:03.707
But that went to Julius.

227
00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:06.865
Hmm.

228
00:16:06.877 --> 00:16:10.213
Julius was a receptionist
when I started.


229
00:16:11.173 --> 00:16:13.925
Mr. Madison must have
seen something in him.


230
00:16:14.676 --> 00:16:17.471
So, what do you think of the network,
as a whole?


231
00:16:18.055 --> 00:16:19.181
Um...

232
00:16:20.557 --> 00:16:23.101
Uh, empowering.

233
00:16:23.977 --> 00:16:25.812
Once more with feeling, darling.

234
00:16:28.231 --> 00:16:30.525
The Block is a good start.

235
00:16:31.651 --> 00:16:34.863
But I think Grant's right.
This new Teddy Riley sound...


236
00:16:36.782 --> 00:16:41.941
Everyone's stealing our styles,
and making it palatable for RMV.


237
00:16:41.953 --> 00:16:44.444
Our music is way beyond the black charts

238
00:16:44.456 --> 00:16:47.334
and we're the only one in town
who will play them.


239
00:16:49.086 --> 00:16:51.797
It's not a niche. 
It's the future.

240
00:16:52.673 --> 00:16:54.329
Why aren't we playing the real deal,

241
00:16:54.341 --> 00:16:58.083
like, what the kids who buy music
actually listen to?


242
00:16:58.095 --> 00:17:01.181
Culture viewership skews fairly older.

243
00:17:02.432 --> 00:17:04.685
Um, right.

244
00:17:05.852 --> 00:17:10.440
So, our VJs could...

245
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.057
host different blocks
of specialized videos


246
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:15.517
throughout the day.

247
00:17:15.529 --> 00:17:18.770
And we could...

248
00:17:18.782 --> 00:17:22.524
more than host.
They could rep different styles of music.


249
00:17:22.536 --> 00:17:25.485
And they have their viewers call in,

250
00:17:25.497 --> 00:17:27.404
and vote for their favorites.

251
00:17:27.416 --> 00:17:29.864
Something for everyone, you know?

252
00:17:29.876 --> 00:17:31.741
So no one feels left out.

253
00:17:31.753 --> 00:17:35.787
All while we cultivate
a more engaged audience.


254
00:17:35.799 --> 00:17:39.720
Consumer research disguised
as entertainment.


255
00:17:40.637 --> 00:17:42.252
Sounds pricey.

256
00:17:42.264 --> 00:17:46.518
- RMV has plenty of empty stages.
We just need a phone line.


257
00:17:49.896 --> 00:17:54.222
Uh, and it all culminates into

258
00:17:54.234 --> 00:17:57.029
a daily live countdown show.

259
00:17:59.197 --> 00:18:00.824
Do me a write-up.

260
00:18:01.575 --> 00:18:04.316
A treatment, some sample scripts,

261
00:18:04.328 --> 00:18:07.873
budget, list of guests that could come on.

262
00:18:12.044 --> 00:18:13.795
How did you know I'd ask for this?

263
00:18:14.796 --> 00:18:16.131
I didn't.

264
00:18:19.259 --> 00:18:21.345
Obviously, I don't need an assistant.

265
00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:26.171
Perhaps an associate producer.

266
00:18:35.442 --> 00:18:38.528
Uh, Anna, who... who does your hair?

267
00:18:39.696 --> 00:18:40.864
No one.

268
00:18:41.406 --> 00:18:42.491
Me.

269
00:18:43.867 --> 00:18:45.494
Aren't you tired of it?

270
00:18:46.703 --> 00:18:49.611
All the stares you get
walking through the RMV lobby?


271
00:18:49.623 --> 00:18:51.750
Everyone wondering why you're here.

272
00:18:52.417 --> 00:18:56.910
If you went to any other floor
in this tower for a job interview,


273
00:18:56.922 --> 00:18:58.757
you wouldn't get past reception.

274
00:18:59.675 --> 00:19:01.051
And you know that.

275
00:19:02.344 --> 00:19:05.055
Sistas get fired for less than that
every day.


276
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:10.256
Now, music people have
certain expectations,


277
00:19:10.268 --> 00:19:12.979
and my girls need to flow freely.

278
00:19:15.023 --> 00:19:18.098
I wonder, do you want to be
one of my girls?


279
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.110
Yes.

280
00:19:49.266 --> 00:19:50.463
Anna's living in a fantasy.

281
00:19:50.475 --> 00:19:52.132
I mean, how long...

282
00:19:52.144 --> 00:19:54.843
- Uh, so this is the book Mama gave me...
- Hey, baby.


283
00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:58.013
Uh, took me years to track it down.

284
00:19:58.025 --> 00:20:01.933
Look who decided to grace us
with her presence.


285
00:20:01.945 --> 00:20:02.893
Unc.

286
00:20:02.905 --> 00:20:04.894
Mama used to know all these by heart.

287
00:20:04.906 --> 00:20:07.147
Almost wondered if there was even
an actual book.


288
00:20:07.159 --> 00:20:09.024
Something new for his
wall of oppression.


289
00:20:09.036 --> 00:20:10.775
Child, please.

290
00:20:10.787 --> 00:20:13.862
Does
it have the, um... what was it?


291
00:20:13.874 --> 00:20:18.033
- "Skinny, Skinny" story.
- "Skinny, skinny, don't you know me."


292
00:20:19.254 --> 00:20:21.911
It's a folk tale the slaves
used to tell about witches


293
00:20:21.923 --> 00:20:24.205
who would leave their own skin
at night to go haunting.


294
00:20:24.217 --> 00:20:26.207
- Oh.
- Aah.


295
00:20:26.219 --> 00:20:29.502
"Moss Hair Girl."
That was the one Mom used to tell.


296
00:20:29.514 --> 00:20:31.516
Uh, can I take a look?

297
00:20:32.726 --> 00:20:35.091
- Uh, yeah.
- Thank you.


298
00:20:35.103 --> 00:20:37.552
So, Anna, how's work?

299
00:20:37.564 --> 00:20:39.971
- Intense.
- Um, I can relate to that.


300
00:20:39.983 --> 00:20:41.890
I hardly see this one anymore.

301
00:20:41.902 --> 00:20:46.019
Well, they have me teaching history now,
in addition to English lit,


302
00:20:46.031 --> 00:20:49.064
and I just started an after school
college prep program.


303
00:20:49.076 --> 00:20:50.899
- Remarkable.
- Uh...


304
00:20:50.911 --> 00:20:53.902
I'm sorry. Anna, I cut you off.
You were talking about work?


305
00:20:53.914 --> 00:20:55.487
Now, are you still interning
for that lady?


306
00:20:55.499 --> 00:20:59.574
Executive assistant, and no.

307
00:20:59.586 --> 00:21:01.242
Actually, she left the company.

308
00:21:01.254 --> 00:21:03.995
Oh. Your job's not
in jeopardy now, is it?


309
00:21:04.007 --> 00:21:06.289
No! Not at all.

310
00:21:06.301 --> 00:21:07.791
Look, they're doing some retooling,

311
00:21:07.803 --> 00:21:11.419
and actually, they're looking at giving me
my own show, so...


312
00:21:11.431 --> 00:21:13.183
When does it air, Anna?

313
00:21:15.602 --> 00:21:18.468
I mean, there's still a lot to do,
so it might be a while,


314
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.512
but it's all moving along.

315
00:21:20.524 --> 00:21:22.180
Hope it works out.

316
00:21:22.192 --> 00:21:24.766
It already is, so...

317
00:21:24.778 --> 00:21:27.644
- Oh, the flying African story.
I did my thesis on these.


318
00:21:27.656 --> 00:21:29.896
- Yes!
- No, that's in there?


319
00:21:29.908 --> 00:21:31.481
It's ridiculous.

320
00:21:31.493 --> 00:21:32.577
I'm sorry?

321
00:21:35.622 --> 00:21:37.487
I'm just, um,

322
00:21:37.499 --> 00:21:41.074
surprised to see a room
full of people


323
00:21:41.086 --> 00:21:43.076
with doctorates, like,

324
00:21:43.088 --> 00:21:46.121
trippin' over superstitions
and fairy tales.


325
00:21:46.133 --> 00:21:47.384
Fairy tales.

326
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.250
Humph.

327
00:21:50.262 --> 00:21:52.377
How does one group of people
subjugate another?


328
00:21:52.389 --> 00:21:54.989
Uh, Amos... No,
no, no. I'm just educating the girl.


329
00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:57.507
You subjugate a people

330
00:21:57.519 --> 00:22:00.844
by telling them their science
is superstition,


331
00:22:00.856 --> 00:22:04.723
their faith is heresy,
and their wisdom is make-believe.


332
00:22:04.735 --> 00:22:07.017
They called the American Indians savages.

333
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:08.280
And they called us...

334
00:22:09.448 --> 00:22:10.645
Well, what didn't they call us?

335
00:22:10.657 --> 00:22:13.606
- I got it, okay?
- No, you don't get it.


336
00:22:13.618 --> 00:22:16.818
From the moment you are born,
you are so thoroughly indoctrinated


337
00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.612
by the insanity of
Western European world views,


338
00:22:19.624 --> 00:22:23.616
you can't bear to see yourself
the way nature would have.


339
00:22:23.628 --> 00:22:27.704
And you scoff at us and our superstitions.
Well...


340
00:22:27.716 --> 00:22:31.791
those superstitions are in fact
tributaries leading to rivers


341
00:22:31.803 --> 00:22:35.795
and oceans of truth
about what you really are.


342
00:22:35.807 --> 00:22:38.089
And who you might have been.

343
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.981
Someone pass the salt.

344
00:22:43.774 --> 00:22:47.223
Uh, why you never bring Julius?

345
00:22:47.235 --> 00:22:49.684
His show is doing really well, so...

346
00:22:49.696 --> 00:22:50.977
it keeps him busy.

347
00:22:50.989 --> 00:22:53.396
- Hmm.
- Our show, really.


348
00:22:53.408 --> 00:22:55.410
But you're making your rent, right?

349
00:22:56.286 --> 00:22:58.193
Anna, no. Your credit.

350
00:22:58.205 --> 00:23:00.445
You can't mess with that. Baby...
They wanna raise the rent 500-


351
00:23:00.457 --> 00:23:02.906
- What? What? 500?

352
00:23:02.918 --> 00:23:04.866
Five hundred bucks. 
I'll figure it out.

353
00:23:04.878 --> 00:23:06.785
No, that is outrageous.

354
00:23:06.797 --> 00:23:09.371
White folks started moving in, so...

355
00:23:09.383 --> 00:23:12.844
Well, they have a habit
of doing that, don't they?


356
00:23:13.637 --> 00:23:15.251
- Auntie, no.
- Mm-mm.


357
00:23:15.263 --> 00:23:19.089
Please. Your uncle doesn't know anything
about my little account.


358
00:23:19.101 --> 00:23:24.189
Humph. Besides, you can pay me back
when your show comes through.


359
00:23:24.606 --> 00:23:25.816
Okay?

360
00:23:29.111 --> 00:23:30.111
Okay.

361
00:23:31.071 --> 00:23:32.727
Mm. So...

362
00:23:32.739 --> 00:23:34.312
We finally gonna do something...
Auntie!


363
00:23:34.324 --> 00:23:37.524
Oh, okay. All right. 
I'm just sayin'...

364
00:23:37.536 --> 00:23:40.318
Wigs have gone a long way since,
you know...


365
00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.987
last time you tried 'em.

366
00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:43.917
What'd you want me to do with that?

367
00:23:44.501 --> 00:23:46.128
It's a book. People read 'em.

368
00:23:47.295 --> 00:23:48.588
I'm good.

369
00:23:51.425 --> 00:23:54.678
I forget to leave Professor Bludso
at work sometimes.


370
00:23:55.846 --> 00:23:57.055
I'm sorry.

371
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:02.173
Don't you think Kieren might be
more into that folklore stuff?


372
00:24:02.185 --> 00:24:03.675
You're into it, too.

373
00:24:03.687 --> 00:24:07.012
As long as it involves a fly girl
making it big in the city.


374
00:24:07.024 --> 00:24:09.347
Starring Sandra.

375
00:24:09.359 --> 00:24:11.182
- A fly girl, huh?
- Hey.


376
00:24:14.781 --> 00:24:16.938
Their stories run the world.

377
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.494
Sure as the sun, these are ours.

378
00:24:51.068 --> 00:24:52.016
Hi.

379
00:24:52.028 --> 00:24:55.185
Um, are your prices listed?

380
00:24:55.197 --> 00:24:56.770
Oh, for a sew in?

381
00:24:56.782 --> 00:24:59.785
- Yeah.
- Oh, hair and service is 450.


382
00:25:01.036 --> 00:25:03.068
- Four hundred and fifty?
- Mm.


383
00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.112
And Virgie's earliest appointment
is the 15th...


384
00:25:06.124 --> 00:25:07.626
of February.

385
00:25:08.085 --> 00:25:10.992
Look, sista to sista,

386
00:25:11.004 --> 00:25:12.577
I work in TV.

387
00:25:12.589 --> 00:25:14.496
I'm actually a VJ at Culture,

388
00:25:14.508 --> 00:25:18.166
and girl to girl, 
I really need this.

389
00:25:18.178 --> 00:25:21.378
Well, I can see that.

390
00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:26.007
Look, I don't know how it works
in your hood, or wherever.


391
00:25:26.019 --> 00:25:30.470
But we are a world-class salon, okay?

392
00:25:30.482 --> 00:25:34.319
Look, I'm sure you can find
someone else to hook you up.


393
00:25:39.199 --> 00:25:40.492
Excuse me!

394
00:25:41.868 --> 00:25:43.650
- Hi.
- Uh, Denise?


395
00:25:43.662 --> 00:25:45.360
Please. I just need a moment.

396
00:25:45.372 --> 00:25:47.445
You ever had a dream?

397
00:25:47.457 --> 00:25:49.614
One you'd be willing
to do anything for?


398
00:25:49.626 --> 00:25:52.409
Very few things are worth
doing anything for, baby.


399
00:25:52.421 --> 00:25:55.745
Right. Especially when
everyone says you can't do it.


400
00:25:55.757 --> 00:25:57.414
You don't deserve this,
says you don't belong


401
00:25:57.426 --> 00:25:59.845
where you know
your destiny tells you to be.


402
00:26:00.345 --> 00:26:02.431
Sista, have you ever been there?

403
00:26:03.265 --> 00:26:04.629
Okay.

404
00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:06.768
It'll be my good deed for the day.

405
00:26:07.978 --> 00:26:11.857
You can wait over
there until she can slip you in.


406
00:27:02.074 --> 00:27:03.700
Sweetheart.

407
00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:09.956
All right, baby.

408
00:27:10.916 --> 00:27:12.417
Let's find her.

409
00:27:15.045 --> 00:27:17.172
Go on and look around, honey.

410
00:27:18.715 --> 00:27:21.468
You won't see my supply
at any other salon.


411
00:27:25.555 --> 00:27:27.432
My sources are exclusive.

412
00:27:39.695 --> 00:27:41.113
I thought so.

413
00:27:42.614 --> 00:27:44.896
I really do feel something.

414
00:27:44.908 --> 00:27:46.910
Clients wear this stuff as magic.

415
00:27:48.578 --> 00:27:50.443
You know, in some parts of India,

416
00:27:50.455 --> 00:27:53.571
a woman's hair is her
most prized possession.


417
00:27:53.583 --> 00:27:56.783
It's the greatest sacrifice
she can make to her gods.


418
00:27:56.795 --> 00:27:59.077
This came all the way from India?

419
00:27:59.089 --> 00:28:01.008
Forget about where it's from.

420
00:28:02.342 --> 00:28:04.207
Let's focus on where it's going.

421
00:28:10.684 --> 00:28:12.966
You're not tender-headed, are you?

422
00:28:12.978 --> 00:28:14.134
I'm sorry!

423
00:28:14.146 --> 00:28:15.731
I'll be fine.

424
00:28:56.563 --> 00:28:57.856
Aah.

425
00:29:02.069 --> 00:29:03.362
Ow.

426
00:29:14.748 --> 00:29:17.322
My mama used a hot comb on me.

427
00:29:19.002 --> 00:29:21.713
And she burned the shit
out of my scalp.


428
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:32.087
Ow. Ow.

429
00:29:36.853 --> 00:29:38.146
You almost finished?

430
00:29:52.828 --> 00:29:53.870
Ow.

431
00:30:14.182 --> 00:30:15.422
Sweetheart.

432
00:30:15.434 --> 00:30:19.312
I'm sorry, I... I've never had
my hair done before.


433
00:30:36.455 --> 00:30:38.403
You're not the first to faint.

434
00:30:40.792 --> 00:30:41.918
Ow.

435
00:31:03.523 --> 00:31:05.817
- It's...
- Stunning.


436
00:31:12.699 --> 00:31:15.243
My line of essential oils for the scalp.

437
00:31:15.869 --> 00:31:17.496
Proprietary blend.

438
00:31:18.205 --> 00:31:21.571
You want to get it between your braids
and work it into the hair,


439
00:31:21.583 --> 00:31:23.323
at least twice a day.

440
00:31:23.335 --> 00:31:26.171
Trust me. And never get it wet.

441
00:31:27.214 --> 00:31:29.329
It'll hurt for the first week or so.

442
00:31:29.341 --> 00:31:32.678
A lot, but that's normal
for the first time.


443
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:35.639
But once you get through it,

444
00:31:37.182 --> 00:31:39.935
I'll never be this bad again, okay?

445
00:31:40.936 --> 00:31:44.094
I thought you said
there wouldn't be anybody else here.


446
00:31:44.106 --> 00:31:45.732
She's leaving.

447
00:31:47.776 --> 00:31:50.862
When she tells you not to get it wet,
believe her.


448
00:31:51.571 --> 00:31:53.186
What the hell, Sandra?

449
00:31:53.198 --> 00:31:54.574
Rain at the venue.

450
00:31:55.158 --> 00:31:57.983
Manager wanted a Diana Ross moment.

451
00:31:57.995 --> 00:31:59.609
Oh, such a fan.

452
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:03.405
I work for Culture, and it's all because
growing up, I saw you.


453
00:32:03.417 --> 00:32:05.168
Someone who looks like me on TV.

454
00:32:06.086 --> 00:32:08.714
Love, love the new video.

455
00:32:09.631 --> 00:32:11.174
So does the label.

456
00:32:30.777 --> 00:32:33.893
Hey! It's Anna. 
Leave a message.

457
00:32:33.905 --> 00:32:35.937
Hey, it's Edna.

458
00:32:35.949 --> 00:32:38.023
It's happening a lot faster
than I thought,


459
00:32:38.035 --> 00:32:40.900
and I want you by my side.
Call me, sis.


460
00:32:43.665 --> 00:32:45.917
This is it! Open it!

461
00:32:50.589 --> 00:32:51.798
Fuck.

462
00:32:52.299 --> 00:32:55.123
- What?
- Fuckin' rent! That's what.


463
00:32:55.135 --> 00:32:56.720
I paid you.

464
00:32:57.262 --> 00:32:58.793
That increase happened after...

465
00:32:58.805 --> 00:33:00.837
The increase happened
when I say it did.


466
00:33:00.849 --> 00:33:03.131
It's 500 bucks. Now.

467
00:33:03.143 --> 00:33:06.343
What are you gonna do? Just
drag me into the middle of the street?


468
00:33:07.689 --> 00:33:08.928
Mr. Tannen!

469
00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:10.430
Cops will do that for me.

470
00:33:10.442 --> 00:33:11.973
Mr. Tannen!

471
00:33:11.985 --> 00:33:14.404
My toilet's overflowing!

472
00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:19.666
"First there was only
the wild beasts and the red man.


473
00:34:19.678 --> 00:34:22.347
Then the white man came
and brought our people."


474
00:34:24.016 --> 00:34:26.059
"The Moss Haired Girl."

475
00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:31.386
"The house negress was a plain woman"

476
00:34:31.398 --> 00:34:35.027
"who took up walking in them woods
when her work was done."


477
00:34:36.903 --> 00:34:40.228
"She'd see tress covered
in black moss so fine


478
00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.896
"it looked like massa hair.

479
00:34:41.908 --> 00:34:45.495
She stole the moss from the tree,
and made herself a wig."


480
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:37.577
Welcome back to RMV.

481
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:39.454
Can you believe it?
We are gonna do something so crazy


482
00:35:39.466 --> 00:35:41.039
and so different for us right now.

483
00:35:41.051 --> 00:35:42.999
Okay, the princess of soul, Sandra...

484
00:35:43.011 --> 00:35:46.211
- Ow! Ow.
- Is now the queen of pop!


485
00:35:46.223 --> 00:35:48.838
Her newest single "I Get It"
is rising the pop charts,


486
00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:51.257
so let's give it
up for her RMV debut.

487
00:35:51.269 --> 00:35:53.313
Here's Sandra!

488
00:36:05.075 --> 00:36:06.272
Yeah, man.

489
00:36:06.284 --> 00:36:07.649
Oh, who dat?

490
00:36:07.661 --> 00:36:09.234
Oh, oh, my, my, my.

491
00:36:09.246 --> 00:36:11.832
Anna, uh, so I got these
Janet Jackson tickets, if you...


492
00:36:12.874 --> 00:36:14.126
Feel like...

493
00:36:15.502 --> 00:36:17.295
- Hey, girl.
- Hi.


494
00:36:20.674 --> 00:36:22.259
Hmm. Humph!

495
00:36:39.401 --> 00:36:40.777
Aah.

496
00:36:43.196 --> 00:36:45.240
- Mm.
- Wow.


497
00:36:45.907 --> 00:36:47.731
You look good, girl.

498
00:36:47.743 --> 00:36:50.037
Hey.

499
00:36:50.912 --> 00:36:52.247
Thanks to you.

500
00:36:53.999 --> 00:36:56.239
I overheard Zora's hair speech.

501
00:36:56.251 --> 00:36:59.117
So, I thought she might like this.

502
00:36:59.129 --> 00:37:00.630
How does it feel?

503
00:37:01.089 --> 00:37:02.162
It's fine.

504
00:37:02.174 --> 00:37:04.622
I know. When I first got mine in,
I wasn't used to all that length.


505
00:37:04.634 --> 00:37:06.833
I was always swiping at my neck,

506
00:37:06.845 --> 00:37:09.348
- like, "What is this?
- Yeah."


507
00:37:10.057 --> 00:37:13.423
Oh, there's a planning meeting
in the conference room at 11:00,


508
00:37:13.435 --> 00:37:15.133
and Zora wants you there.

509
00:37:15.145 --> 00:37:17.356
She... She does?

510
00:37:17.647 --> 00:37:18.845
She does.

511
00:37:30.952 --> 00:37:32.150
Ew!

512
00:37:37.918 --> 00:37:39.419
I told you.

513
00:37:42.214 --> 00:37:43.465
So sad.

514
00:37:50.097 --> 00:37:52.140
Mm. Lookin' fly, Anna.

515
00:37:53.058 --> 00:37:54.589
Fuck you.

516
00:37:54.601 --> 00:37:57.062
So, uh, here's where I'm at.

517
00:37:57.938 --> 00:37:59.678
No more cooking shows.

518
00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.554
No more hair shows.

519
00:38:01.566 --> 00:38:03.682
No more endless blocks
of Anita Baker.


520
00:38:03.694 --> 00:38:06.935
She gave us good love,
and we've had enough of it.


521
00:38:06.947 --> 00:38:09.270
Ooh, uh, what's wrong with
Anita Baker?


522
00:38:09.282 --> 00:38:11.398
Look, Hair Beat got mad ratings.

523
00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:14.109
A point 6 in 5 share
would make me mad, as well.


524
00:38:14.121 --> 00:38:15.402
That ain't bad for cable.

525
00:38:15.414 --> 00:38:17.821
Brook, you are better than Hair Beat.

526
00:38:17.833 --> 00:38:19.322
You've got personality.

527
00:38:19.334 --> 00:38:20.907
With clothes that fit,
you could be a star.


528
00:38:20.919 --> 00:38:23.284
Sista Soul, you could be...

529
00:38:23.296 --> 00:38:24.589
something.

530
00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:27.998
The quiet storm is a little
too loud for our channel.


531
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.291
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I love the whole organic,


532
00:38:30.303 --> 00:38:33.378
earthy dashiki vibe,
but we need to find you a new lane.


533
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.255
A new lane?

534
00:38:35.267 --> 00:38:38.508
Sista, I represent black women, okay?

535
00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:40.135
Real working women.

536
00:38:40.147 --> 00:38:41.761
Who evidently don't have cable.

537
00:38:41.773 --> 00:38:43.888
Don't come up in here trying to
make us something we ain't.


538
00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.849
Yo, yo, yo. I
don't want to change you.

539
00:38:45.861 --> 00:38:47.475
- Mostly just Sista.
- Brook.


540
00:38:47.487 --> 00:38:50.437
I want you more... whatever this is.

541
00:38:50.449 --> 00:38:53.690
This is what we can sell
advertising around.


542
00:38:53.702 --> 00:38:56.109
Uh, let us not be precious here.

543
00:38:56.121 --> 00:38:57.706
Back me up on this, Anna.

544
00:38:58.915 --> 00:39:01.531
Oh, so you've been
talking to her about us.


545
00:39:01.543 --> 00:39:03.783
- Got it.
- I didn't say anything like that.


546
00:39:03.795 --> 00:39:05.130
Humph.

547
00:39:05.756 --> 00:39:07.620
- Wow.
- This is what I want to do.


548
00:39:07.632 --> 00:39:10.582
I want to create a
programming centerpiece.


549
00:39:10.594 --> 00:39:12.625
Live. Something fresh.

550
00:39:12.637 --> 00:39:14.919
- A live call-in countdown show.
- Live countdown show.


551
00:39:14.931 --> 00:39:16.880
- Viewers rank their favorite videos.
- ...vote for their favorites.


552
00:39:16.892 --> 00:39:19.883
Then we create programming blocks to
showcase these videos, - ...who rep different styles.


553
00:39:19.895 --> 00:39:22.302
...in new and exciting ways.

554
00:39:23.607 --> 00:39:27.682
You want us to reprogram
an entire network...


555
00:39:27.694 --> 00:39:29.768
...in six weeks?

556
00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.367
If you plan to still be working here
in six weeks, Sheryl, yes.


557
00:39:33.909 --> 00:39:35.410
What kind of advertising?

558
00:39:40.582 --> 00:39:42.322
You wanted to see me?

559
00:39:42.334 --> 00:39:43.960
What the hell was that in there?

560
00:39:44.795 --> 00:39:46.618
I'm just confused.

561
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.286
You haven't commented on the proposal,

562
00:39:48.298 --> 00:39:50.288
and suddenly...
You being invited in a meeting


563
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.719
with producers and hosts
was my comment.


564
00:39:54.805 --> 00:39:56.098
Virgie's?

565
00:39:58.767 --> 00:39:59.881
Yes.

566
00:39:59.893 --> 00:40:01.186
It has her signature.

567
00:40:04.815 --> 00:40:05.815
What?

568
00:40:08.485 --> 00:40:10.362
Are you giving me the show?

569
00:40:17.911 --> 00:40:19.204
To host?

570
00:40:19.788 --> 00:40:23.375
Awful big bet to make on someone
who's never hosted a show before.


571
00:40:24.001 --> 00:40:26.950
Like the one Grant made on Julius?

572
00:40:26.962 --> 00:40:29.119
Or is Julius somehow special?

573
00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.497
What are you getting at?

574
00:40:32.509 --> 00:40:36.167
It just seems like Julius is the
only one not under a microscope.


575
00:40:36.179 --> 00:40:39.379
Like he's getting special treatment
or something.


576
00:40:39.391 --> 00:40:41.143
And why would he get that?

577
00:40:43.895 --> 00:40:45.593
Because we're fucking?

578
00:40:45.605 --> 00:40:47.482
What?

579
00:40:48.734 --> 00:40:50.152
We're fucking.

580
00:40:50.861 --> 00:40:52.517
You have a problem with that?

581
00:40:52.529 --> 00:40:53.685
Why would I?

582
00:40:53.697 --> 00:40:56.813
Your private life is your business.

583
00:40:56.825 --> 00:40:59.190
A live show is all hands on deck.

584
00:40:59.202 --> 00:41:00.900
I need everyone working on this.

585
00:41:00.912 --> 00:41:04.082
I will decide who the lead is
when I can see what you all can do.


586
00:41:05.167 --> 00:41:06.167
Cool?

587
00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:10.994
Oh, and, uh, Anna?

588
00:41:11.006 --> 00:41:13.342
Get your girls in check.

589
00:41:27.981 --> 00:41:29.983
Zora's who you've been seeing?

590
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.726
Nigga, you get out the hood
off my idea. You wanna what, trade up?


591
00:41:34.738 --> 00:41:36.311
Just chill with that.

592
00:41:36.323 --> 00:41:37.395
Who else knows?

593
00:41:37.407 --> 00:41:41.566
- Your girl told me.
And I use the term "girl" very loosely.


594
00:41:41.578 --> 00:41:44.819
- 'Cause she old enough to be your mama.
- Enough with that.


595
00:41:44.831 --> 00:41:45.945
Okay?

596
00:41:45.957 --> 00:41:49.157
- But it makes sense.
'Cause you act like a fuckin' child!


597
00:41:49.169 --> 00:41:53.495
So, what, you're gonna sleep your way
to the top, like a little bitch?


598
00:41:53.507 --> 00:41:56.885
- What?
- This is the first time I actually heard you raise your voice.


599
00:41:57.636 --> 00:41:59.513
- I kind of like it.
- Fuck you!


600
00:42:00.722 --> 00:42:02.879
Listen, I don't want this
to get out okay?


601
00:42:02.891 --> 00:42:04.464
Tell Zora that, then.

602
00:42:04.476 --> 00:42:05.602
Oh, I will.

603
00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:09.460
You know, I'm not the only one
with secrets around this place.


604
00:42:10.941 --> 00:42:14.361
Unless you found somebody
to do that thing that you like.


605
00:42:16.196 --> 00:42:17.811
What's that got to do with anything?

606
00:42:17.823 --> 00:42:20.355
This is a gossipy office, and, uh...

607
00:42:20.367 --> 00:42:23.203
your discretion is appreciated, okay?

608
00:42:26.331 --> 00:42:27.791
We had fun.

609
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.502
Let's not make it more than that, okay?

610
00:43:07.873 --> 00:43:09.207
Ow.

611
00:43:22.387 --> 00:43:24.002
Hey, it's me!

612
00:43:24.014 --> 00:43:26.087
Just wanted to make sure
you're not dead.


613
00:43:27.976 --> 00:43:30.187
- Hey.
- Whoa.


614
00:43:30.729 --> 00:43:34.846
So this is why you haven't been
at dinner in a while. Okay.


615
00:43:34.858 --> 00:43:38.266
Oh, my God. Dad is going to flip.
And Mom?


616
00:43:38.278 --> 00:43:41.281
- Actually, Mom's gonna love it, but...
- So nice to see you, too, Linda.


617
00:43:41.948 --> 00:43:44.356
You hungry?

618
00:43:44.368 --> 00:43:46.107
You can't get that wet, can you?

619
00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:47.609
Like, at all.

620
00:43:47.621 --> 00:43:50.528
Oh, honey. I think you're allergic.

621
00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.530
No, it's human.

622
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:54.032
I think my neck's just...

623
00:43:54.044 --> 00:43:57.202
not used to having all this
brushing up against it.


624
00:43:57.214 --> 00:44:00.967
Oh, so you're the one
that's been hogging this.


625
00:44:02.135 --> 00:44:04.042
Unc gave that to me to read.

626
00:44:04.054 --> 00:44:05.806
Yeah, like a month ago.

627
00:44:06.682 --> 00:44:08.975
Okay. Keep it. I don't care.

628
00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.445
Hey. I wasn't done!

629
00:44:21.905 --> 00:44:23.031
It's fine.

630
00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.523
Kieren says I've put on a few.

631
00:44:26.535 --> 00:44:27.744
What?

632
00:44:30.247 --> 00:44:31.611
Hey, what...

633
00:44:31.623 --> 00:44:33.750
What does Julius think?

634
00:44:36.378 --> 00:44:37.713
He loves it.

635
00:44:42.718 --> 00:44:45.804
You must have all those
famous people on speed-dial.


636
00:44:48.432 --> 00:44:50.213
I mean, not all of 'em.

637
00:44:51.893 --> 00:44:53.270
So cool.

638
00:44:53.729 --> 00:44:55.814
You knew what you were gonna do
your whole life.


639
00:44:56.565 --> 00:44:58.942
Dad knew what I was gonna do
before I was even born.


640
00:44:59.818 --> 00:45:01.528
Must be nice.

641
00:45:04.948 --> 00:45:06.646
I should... I should go.

642
00:45:06.658 --> 00:45:08.618
Oh, but first...

643
00:45:10.954 --> 00:45:12.289
These are for you.

644
00:45:14.458 --> 00:45:16.877
Aah! Thank you.

645
00:45:30.057 --> 00:45:32.088
- Love you.
- Love you, too.


646
00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:35.133
- Have a good night.
- Okay. Drive safe.


647
00:45:35.145 --> 00:45:37.147
I always do!

648
00:45:51.453 --> 00:45:53.777
You're
tuned to Bludso on the radio.


649
00:45:53.789 --> 00:45:57.906
Stage one of my dramatic transformation
is almost complete.


650
00:45:57.918 --> 00:46:00.438
Oh, my God. You're such a child.

651
00:46:00.545 --> 00:46:04.704
Well, I'm an actual child, so...

652
00:46:04.716 --> 00:46:06.539
how is that an insult?

653
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:13.421
It just means it's working.

654
00:46:16.687 --> 00:46:19.219
Listeners, the music will be right back

655
00:46:19.231 --> 00:46:20.816
after a quick break.

656
00:46:23.652 --> 00:46:26.059
Fine, but don't
get mad when you're just as nappy as you ever were.


657
00:46:26.071 --> 00:46:27.572
Mr. Tannen.

658
00:46:29.866 --> 00:46:31.898
- May I help you with...?
- Do we still gotta do this?


659
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.358
Come on, Linda!

660
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:35.068
- I'm right here!
- Do what?


661
00:46:37.833 --> 00:46:39.876
I actually have your money.

662
00:46:40.544 --> 00:46:42.546
W
-Why don't you hold onto it?

663
00:46:45.048 --> 00:46:46.538
You been drinking, Mr. Tannen?

664
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:49.749
- Don't do that.
You're not the only one, you know.


665
00:46:49.761 --> 00:46:51.013
I know the game.

666
00:46:51.847 --> 00:46:53.336
You know, my cousin's actually waiting...

667
00:46:53.348 --> 00:46:55.392
No, she's not.

668
00:46:56.143 --> 00:46:57.853
Relax, baby.

669
00:46:58.478 --> 00:47:01.606
Black pussy is a passion of mine.

670
00:47:03.066 --> 00:47:05.527
How about some music? 
Thin walls, right?

671
00:47:07.362 --> 00:47:08.727
Okay.

672
00:47:12.951 --> 00:47:15.370
YOUNG ANNA : Linda!

673
00:47:32.512 --> 00:47:33.972
Fuck!

674
00:47:34.348 --> 00:47:35.587
Aah! Aah!

675
00:47:37.142 --> 00:47:38.840
Aah!

676
00:47:38.852 --> 00:47:40.312
Aah!

677
00:47:40.812 --> 00:47:42.773
We're just gettin' started. Yeah!

678
00:48:08.882 --> 00:48:10.384
Mr. Tannen?

679
00:48:15.097 --> 00:48:16.556
Mr. Tannen.

680
00:48:33.156 --> 00:48:34.324
Oh.

681
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:45.836
What the fuck is this?

682
00:49:09.901 --> 00:49:11.975
Good morning, Los Angeles.

683
00:49:11.987 --> 00:49:14.853
You were listening to "One Night,"
the latest from Sandra.


684
00:49:14.865 --> 00:49:17.397
We got traffic and weather coming up
for you right after the break,


685
00:49:17.409 --> 00:49:18.606
but first, some good news.

686
00:49:18.618 --> 00:49:19.733
Stay close to that dial

687
00:49:19.745 --> 00:49:22.277
for your chance to win tickets
to see the The Fellas,


688
00:49:22.289 --> 00:49:24.404
live and in concert at the Forum.

689
00:49:31.882 --> 00:49:33.705
- We're ready to transport.
- All right.


690
00:49:36.511 --> 00:49:39.210
- Oh, my gosh.
- Mm-hmm. Mr. Tannen.


691
00:49:39.222 --> 00:49:42.309
They found that bastard
dead in the dumpster.


692
00:49:43.226 --> 00:49:46.718
The door to the roof was open.
There was empty bottles of gin everywhere.


693
00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:49.179
You know what? 
I bet he slipped.

694
00:49:49.191 --> 00:49:51.014
Ooh, that drunk-ass.

695
00:49:51.026 --> 00:49:52.277
Liv.

696
00:49:53.195 --> 00:49:54.363
Yeah.

697
00:49:54.988 --> 00:49:56.365
How horrible.

698
00:49:56.782 --> 00:49:58.146
You know what he did to me?

699
00:49:58.158 --> 00:50:01.024
He tried to raise my rent by $500.

700
00:50:01.036 --> 00:50:03.997
I had to threaten to sue his ass.
He ever try that shit with you?


701
00:50:05.916 --> 00:50:09.616
- No. Thank God.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, praise Heaven.


702
00:50:09.628 --> 00:50:11.701
Fucking rapist.

703
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:16.748
Damn, that took a turn.

704
00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:20.460
Ooh, Mr. Tannen, you dead.
Bye, girl.


705
00:50:36.822 --> 00:50:40.325
I'm not changing who I am
just to appeal to some whiter...


706
00:50:41.159 --> 00:50:43.692
...wider demographic.

707
00:50:43.704 --> 00:50:46.861
No one's asking you
to change who you are. Just...


708
00:50:46.873 --> 00:50:48.250
the way you look.

709
00:50:48.959 --> 00:50:50.281
The name of your show.

710
00:50:50.293 --> 00:50:52.283
It's not that big of a deal.

711
00:50:52.295 --> 00:50:54.619
You know how long
it took me to get here?


712
00:50:54.631 --> 00:50:57.080
How many interviews I've had to walk into,

713
00:50:57.092 --> 00:50:59.499
not knowing if they wanted Angela Davis,

714
00:50:59.511 --> 00:51:02.002
or Diahann Carroll, or Queen Latifah,

715
00:51:02.014 --> 00:51:04.337
or fucking Claire Huxtable.

716
00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:06.464
I'm sick of this shit!

717
00:51:06.476 --> 00:51:09.718
- Come on, Sista.
It ain't gotta be all that.


718
00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.387
I mean, look. Black women are magic.
You know that.


719
00:51:12.399 --> 00:51:14.305
We could put our hair
all the way up to the sky,


720
00:51:14.317 --> 00:51:16.766
drape it down to our shoulders,
or somewhere in between.


721
00:51:16.778 --> 00:51:19.769
Shit, Patti LaBelle changed her hairstyle

722
00:51:19.781 --> 00:51:21.187
What you need is a new attitude.

723
00:51:21.199 --> 00:51:22.981
Yeah, but that was her choice.

724
00:51:22.993 --> 00:51:24.774
A career in TV was your choice.

725
00:51:24.786 --> 00:51:27.736
I chose a career at Culture.

726
00:51:27.748 --> 00:51:30.196
A place where I ain't gotta
look like a different bitch every week


727
00:51:30.208 --> 00:51:31.281
just to do what I love.

728
00:51:31.293 --> 00:51:33.754
Culture is dead.

729
00:51:34.546 --> 00:51:36.381
For real?

730
00:51:37.674 --> 00:51:39.622
- Sista.
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.


731
00:51:39.634 --> 00:51:40.635
Sista...

732
00:51:43.055 --> 00:51:44.264
Sista...

733
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:47.672
Hey.

734
00:51:47.684 --> 00:51:51.092
- Yes, Sheryl?
- Um, is this a programming meeting?


735
00:51:51.104 --> 00:51:52.385
It was.

736
00:51:52.397 --> 00:51:54.066
I wasn't informed.

737
00:51:54.983 --> 00:51:56.485
I'm the VP of programming.

738
00:51:57.611 --> 00:51:59.392
What have you done for me lately?

739
00:52:01.156 --> 00:52:02.574
Anna, you have a month.

740
00:52:05.494 --> 00:52:08.276
It's not fair. It's not,

741
00:52:08.288 --> 00:52:10.248
playing by these rules, but...

742
00:52:10.999 --> 00:52:13.585
Do you really want to quit the game?

743
00:52:15.754 --> 00:52:18.965
And it's fun. I'm telling you.
It's like...


744
00:52:19.883 --> 00:52:21.885
Like Halloween or something.

745
00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.670
People look at you
and they see somebody else,


746
00:52:26.682 --> 00:52:31.645
and somehow, you become...
more of yourself.


747
00:52:33.897 --> 00:52:37.109
Or at least, a bigger version, or...

748
00:52:39.027 --> 00:52:40.153
I don't know.

749
00:52:41.863 --> 00:52:43.311
Look,

750
00:52:43.323 --> 00:52:45.605
let's just get through this season,

751
00:52:45.617 --> 00:52:47.565
and then take that shit out.

752
00:52:47.577 --> 00:52:49.776
Wear what you want to wear.

753
00:52:49.788 --> 00:52:54.906
And we'll all go to Jamaica, or something.

754
00:52:54.918 --> 00:52:56.783
Jamaica, bitch?

755
00:52:56.795 --> 00:52:59.214
You, me, and Brook.

756
00:53:01.258 --> 00:53:02.467
Look...

757
00:53:03.343 --> 00:53:06.221
Please, please don't quit.

758
00:53:07.597 --> 00:53:10.100
Y'all the only ones here I understand.

759
00:53:16.148 --> 00:53:17.691
I'll think about it.

760
00:53:18.567 --> 00:53:20.110
Got the news.

761
00:53:54.478 --> 00:53:56.146
Never again.

762
00:53:57.522 --> 00:53:59.304
Baxter was a...

763
00:53:59.316 --> 00:54:02.861
a bad man. But I'm not...

764
00:54:14.081 --> 00:54:15.374
Aah!

765
00:54:19.961 --> 00:54:22.005
Come on! Come on, come on!

766
00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:24.996
So, Sista.

767
00:54:25.008 --> 00:54:26.498
Divas with soul.

768
00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:28.208
A block of all women,

769
00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:31.586
MCs, soul singers,
and of course, occasionally,


770
00:54:31.598 --> 00:54:33.183
the men we love.

771
00:54:34.726 --> 00:54:35.977
Nice.

772
00:54:41.191 --> 00:54:44.432
Um, so, with Sista,

773
00:54:44.444 --> 00:54:48.240
we now have enough VJs for every segment
of the audience.


774
00:54:48.824 --> 00:54:52.816
Mm, that just leaves a host.

775
00:54:52.828 --> 00:54:56.319
I think you'd agree that
no one Grant's team suggested had that.


776
00:54:56.331 --> 00:55:00.365
Anna, I know how hard
you're angling for this, and...


777
00:55:00.377 --> 00:55:02.838
I've seen the work you're putting in,
and...


778
00:55:03.922 --> 00:55:05.078
I'm impressed.

779
00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:11.221
You still using the pink stuff?

780
00:55:13.265 --> 00:55:14.587
Yeah.

781
00:55:14.599 --> 00:55:15.976
It's not enough, is it?

782
00:55:16.727 --> 00:55:19.855
What? Do you mean...?

783
00:55:20.272 --> 00:55:22.387
Guess who...?

784
00:55:22.399 --> 00:55:25.265
Ooh. My bad, Anna.

785
00:55:25.277 --> 00:55:28.393
You, uh, ready for that lunch meeting?

786
00:55:28.405 --> 00:55:29.978
I'm starving.

787
00:55:33.827 --> 00:55:35.912
Can't wait for tonight.

788
00:55:48.216 --> 00:55:49.885
You okay, Sis?

789
00:55:52.763 --> 00:55:54.502
Up all night.

790
00:55:54.514 --> 00:55:56.475
Lord, they put this thing in tight.

791
00:55:57.434 --> 00:55:58.757
I'll be all right.

792
00:55:58.769 --> 00:56:01.801
- What changed your mind, girl?
I love it.


793
00:56:01.813 --> 00:56:03.261
Me, too, girl.

794
00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:08.653
You did good today.

795
00:56:09.363 --> 00:56:10.530
Thanks, girl.

796
00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:24.461
Ow.

797
00:56:28.048 --> 00:56:29.591
Are you serious?

798
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:17.389
This never happened.

799
00:57:48.503 --> 00:57:51.119
What's up, everybody?
We are here to celebrate


800
00:57:51.131 --> 00:57:54.956
the hottest 24-hour music network, Cult,

801
00:57:54.968 --> 00:57:57.334
and here are The Fellas!

802
00:58:02.476 --> 00:58:03.798
Hey.

803
00:58:06.271 --> 00:58:08.648
Wow. Oh, my God.

804
00:58:09.066 --> 00:58:10.400
You look great.

805
00:58:21.995 --> 00:58:24.486
- Hey!
- Sista!


806
00:58:24.498 --> 00:58:26.446
Look at you.

807
00:58:26.458 --> 00:58:27.739
Wow!

808
00:58:27.751 --> 00:58:29.157
Anna.

809
00:58:29.169 --> 00:58:31.660
You never called me back.

810
00:58:31.672 --> 00:58:33.620
Babe, I've been so busy.

811
00:58:33.632 --> 00:58:36.956
Rubbish. I want you and me
at the Madonna party, okay?


812
00:58:36.968 --> 00:58:38.958
- Call me back.
- I'll see. I'll see.


813
00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:40.514
Okay.

814
00:58:45.477 --> 00:58:46.508
...every time!

815
00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.105
Well, as I live and breathe.

816
00:58:49.648 --> 00:58:51.471
You made it!

817
00:58:51.483 --> 00:58:55.892
Isn't it exquisite?

818
00:58:55.904 --> 00:58:58.144
Yes, well,
it's certainly very different.


819
00:59:00.242 --> 00:59:02.107
Uh, what'd you say?

820
00:59:02.119 --> 00:59:03.817
Congratulations.

821
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:07.195
We... so need to catch up.

822
00:59:07.207 --> 00:59:09.030
Let's go find somewhere to talk.

823
00:59:09.042 --> 00:59:10.252
Come on.

824
00:59:10.836 --> 00:59:14.703
Now, your first reaction may be
that the office seems cold.


825
00:59:14.715 --> 00:59:19.553
But we like to think of Cult
as a little more posh.


826
00:59:21.221 --> 00:59:22.681
Wouldn't you say?

827
00:59:23.557 --> 00:59:25.296
That's some hair.

828
00:59:25.308 --> 00:59:26.798
Yeah.

829
00:59:26.810 --> 00:59:29.092
Can you believe it?

830
00:59:29.104 --> 00:59:31.023
I'd have to see it to believe it.

831
00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.766
It's...

832
00:59:36.778 --> 00:59:39.561
been hard without you, Edna.

833
00:59:39.573 --> 00:59:42.022
You seem to have adjusted pretty well.

834
00:59:42.034 --> 00:59:43.815
I had no choice.

835
00:59:43.827 --> 00:59:45.775
You always have a choice.

836
00:59:45.787 --> 00:59:47.164
Not always.

837
00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:49.624
Okay.

838
00:59:52.127 --> 00:59:54.421
Edna, what is it?

839
00:59:56.965 --> 00:59:58.413
Grant offered me the world

840
00:59:58.425 --> 01:00:02.667
to turn what was for the people,
by the people, into...


841
01:00:02.679 --> 01:00:03.764
this.

842
01:00:04.514 --> 01:00:06.099
I chose to walk away.

843
01:00:07.017 --> 01:00:08.631
I almost got evicted.

844
01:00:08.643 --> 01:00:10.467
I had something for you, Anna.

845
01:00:10.479 --> 01:00:12.135
You never returned my phone calls.

846
01:00:12.147 --> 01:00:14.149
I have something here.

847
01:00:15.067 --> 01:00:17.640
Finally, after four years.
You want me to start over?


848
01:00:17.652 --> 01:00:19.142
I can't afford that.

849
01:00:19.154 --> 01:00:21.353
You couldn't afford that hair,
but that didn't stop you.


850
01:00:21.365 --> 01:00:23.450
Mm.

851
01:00:27.162 --> 01:00:29.486
Not with what you paid me.

852
01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:33.669
She's giving me my own show.

853
01:00:35.087 --> 01:00:36.713
More than that.

854
01:00:37.422 --> 01:00:43.053
She's making me the centerpiece
of the entire channel.


855
01:00:46.264 --> 01:00:47.921
Well, I hope it's worth it.

856
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:56.692
There's a code.

857
01:00:58.443 --> 01:01:02.727
Uh, 1-8-6-6,

858
01:01:02.739 --> 01:01:04.646
9-8.

859
01:01:06.451 --> 01:01:08.191
It's still locked.

860
01:01:08.203 --> 01:01:09.413
Did you press pound?

861
01:01:13.208 --> 01:01:15.532
Like I said, I hope it's worth it.

862
01:01:15.544 --> 01:01:16.825
It is.

863
01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:21.663
It is.

864
01:01:32.477 --> 01:01:35.093
Yeah, you know I could help you
with whatever you need.


865
01:01:35.105 --> 01:01:36.803
Yeah.

866
01:01:36.815 --> 01:01:38.888
Julius!

867
01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:41.111
Mm, mm, mm.

868
01:01:50.162 --> 01:01:51.401
Hey.

869
01:01:51.413 --> 01:01:54.529
Oh, my God. Hey.

870
01:01:54.541 --> 01:01:56.501
Um, you're...
Germane.


871
01:01:58.128 --> 01:02:01.077
I met you at Sandra's spot, right?

872
01:02:01.089 --> 01:02:04.122
Yeah, Anna. Anna Bludso, um, with Cult.

873
01:02:04.134 --> 01:02:07.042
- Hey, let me ask you a question.
Have you been back...


874
01:02:07.054 --> 01:02:09.002
there? Virgie's.

875
01:02:09.014 --> 01:02:11.087
Oh. No.

876
01:02:11.099 --> 01:02:12.088
Why?

877
01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:15.258
It's just that ever since
she started going there,


878
01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:17.552
Sandra's been acting a little...

879
01:02:17.564 --> 01:02:19.054
Anna.

880
01:02:19.066 --> 01:02:20.430
Anna Bludso.

881
01:02:20.442 --> 01:02:22.110
Mr. Madison?

882
01:02:23.153 --> 01:02:24.153
Zora?

883
01:02:25.572 --> 01:02:27.645
- You know what?
It's not a big deal.


884
01:02:27.657 --> 01:02:30.148
No, you should stay and say hi.

885
01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.913
Uh, I don't do suits. I, uh...

886
01:02:34.289 --> 01:02:35.832
I, I'll see you around.

887
01:02:45.217 --> 01:02:47.791
So, word on the street is
you're our secret weapon.


888
01:02:47.803 --> 01:02:50.085
Where did Zora find you?

889
01:02:50.097 --> 01:02:52.837
I've worked here for four years.

890
01:02:54.768 --> 01:02:57.884
So, Zora shared with me
your plans for Cult Live. Brilliant.


891
01:02:57.896 --> 01:03:00.053
Now, be prepared. You're gonna get
a little bit of push back


892
01:03:00.065 --> 01:03:02.305
on the host thing. I'm all in.

893
01:03:02.317 --> 01:03:03.807
Yeah? You are?

894
01:03:03.819 --> 01:03:06.226
There's no one better to have
as the face of Cult Live.


895
01:03:06.238 --> 01:03:07.977
Wow.

896
01:03:07.989 --> 01:03:10.814
- You really mean that?
- Abso-fucking-lutely.


897
01:03:10.826 --> 01:03:13.996
Zora back on screen? Slam dunk.

898
01:03:16.957 --> 01:03:19.751
Very proud of what the two of you
put together. All right?


899
01:03:20.502 --> 01:03:22.158
Excuse me. Rosalyn?

900
01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:24.452
- Anna...
- Zora.


901
01:03:24.464 --> 01:03:26.466
Sorry, excuse me, Anna. 
This is, um...

902
01:03:29.803 --> 01:03:32.127
Z, I mean, come on. 
It's your party.

903
01:03:32.139 --> 01:03:33.712
And you've ruined it.

904
01:03:33.724 --> 01:03:35.142
Where the hell were you?

905
01:03:36.727 --> 01:03:39.217
Hey. Come on.
Hey, don't leave...


906
01:03:39.229 --> 01:03:41.523
Eh, Anna... I mean, Zora!

907
01:03:42.566 --> 01:03:43.775
Shit.

908
01:03:58.707 --> 01:04:00.238
Everything okay?

909
01:04:02.627 --> 01:04:04.171
You smoking again?

910
01:04:11.345 --> 01:04:13.221
So, um, you good?

911
01:04:16.224 --> 01:04:18.715
Listen, she's a monster, Anna.

912
01:04:18.727 --> 01:04:21.676
She's manipulative, she's possessive,

913
01:04:21.688 --> 01:04:25.692
she's insecure...
It must be awful, Julius.


914
01:04:28.737 --> 01:04:30.810
I really fucked things up, huh?

915
01:04:30.822 --> 01:04:32.908
Yeah.

916
01:04:33.450 --> 01:04:34.785
Yeah, I know I did.

917
01:04:35.786 --> 01:04:37.359
Can I tell you something?

918
01:04:37.371 --> 01:04:38.538
Fuck!

919
01:04:39.164 --> 01:04:40.654
What?

920
01:04:40.666 --> 01:04:44.908
I miss you. Okay?
So, so much. And I...

921
01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.757
I know it's not fair to you,
and I shouldn't say that, but it's true.


922
01:04:51.343 --> 01:04:52.636
You ever...

923
01:04:53.679 --> 01:04:54.805
...miss me?

924
01:04:56.765 --> 01:04:58.308
I know, I shouldn't ask that.

925
01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:00.811
Right?

926
01:05:06.066 --> 01:05:07.484
You drive?

927
01:05:20.247 --> 01:05:22.290
Which one? Red or white, Anna?

928
01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:27.879
Anna?

929
01:05:29.798 --> 01:05:32.426
I used to fantasize about
waking up in your bed.


930
01:05:33.969 --> 01:05:36.751
And I would go to start
packing my things,


931
01:05:36.763 --> 01:05:38.420
and you would grab me.

932
01:05:38.432 --> 01:05:41.172
And you would say,

933
01:05:41.184 --> 01:05:43.967
"Where are you going, Anna?

934
01:05:43.979 --> 01:05:46.148
This is your home, Anna."

935
01:05:47.899 --> 01:05:49.484
That's so stupid, huh?

936
01:05:54.698 --> 01:05:55.937
I'm gonna go.

937
01:05:55.949 --> 01:05:59.995
Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.


938
01:06:00.912 --> 01:06:02.319
Where you going?

939
01:06:33.862 --> 01:06:35.614
Pick your weapon.

940
01:06:36.656 --> 01:06:37.979
Oh!

941
01:06:39.743 --> 01:06:41.900
That's it?

942
01:06:41.912 --> 01:06:43.526
I've got an early morning.

943
01:06:43.538 --> 01:06:45.028
Mm.

944
01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.988
I'll be looking like Zorro.

945
01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.407
Or I'll be the Phantom of Your
Ass. Come on.


946
01:06:49.419 --> 01:06:51.743
- Did you miss that?
- Yeah. You miss this?


947
01:06:53.965 --> 01:06:55.455
Fuck.

948
01:06:56.593 --> 01:06:58.875
- Last time you were inside of me...
- Uh-huh...


949
01:06:58.887 --> 01:07:01.044
Were you thinking about her?

950
01:07:01.056 --> 01:07:04.214
- Who?
- Zora. Were you thinking of her?


951
01:07:04.226 --> 01:07:05.840
Huh? Wha...

952
01:07:05.852 --> 01:07:07.801
Oh, Anna.

953
01:07:07.813 --> 01:07:09.177
Your eyes.

954
01:07:09.189 --> 01:07:11.054
You never looked so beautiful.

955
01:07:13.235 --> 01:07:16.184
And what about the blonde from RMV?

956
01:07:16.196 --> 01:07:18.311
Huh? What?
I don't know what you're talking...


957
01:07:18.323 --> 01:07:20.438
From the party. The blonde.

958
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:22.649
Oh. Where are you going with this?

959
01:07:22.661 --> 01:07:23.870
I want to know...

960
01:07:25.539 --> 01:07:28.113
- I'm the best...
- The best...


961
01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:33.034
Yeah, you never
could resist a little bit of rope, huh?


962
01:07:33.046 --> 01:07:34.703
- Guess not.
- Fucking ride that dick.


963
01:07:34.715 --> 01:07:36.788
Ride that shit hard...
I'm the best?


964
01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.124
- Fuckin' best, baby.
- Best you ever had?


965
01:07:39.136 --> 01:07:41.334
Best I fucking had!

966
01:07:44.516 --> 01:07:46.715
Then why did you leave?

967
01:07:46.727 --> 01:07:49.968
- Could... Could you chill out, baby?
It's a little sensitive down there.


968
01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:51.553
I can relate.

969
01:07:54.985 --> 01:07:56.766
Aah! Aah!

970
01:08:17.674 --> 01:08:19.748
I did what the box told me.

971
01:09:03.345 --> 01:09:05.764
- Hello?
- Hey, Linda?


972
01:09:06.348 --> 01:09:08.004
Hey, it's Anna.

973
01:09:08.016 --> 01:09:10.560
Uh, you know that book? Unc's book?

974
01:09:11.436 --> 01:09:14.427
I never finished the moss girl story.
Could you read it to me?


975
01:09:14.439 --> 01:09:15.679
Right now?

976
01:09:15.691 --> 01:09:17.722
Just from the part
where she gets the wig.


977
01:09:17.734 --> 01:09:20.600
You know,
it helps me fall asleep.


978
01:09:20.612 --> 01:09:23.770
That's... not weird at all.

979
01:09:23.782 --> 01:09:27.399
So, slave girl... Moss...
Blah, blah, blah. All right...


980
01:09:27.411 --> 01:09:29.192
"She made herself a wig.

981
01:09:29.204 --> 01:09:32.654
"She sees herself in the mirror
and she thinks she looks good.


982
01:09:32.666 --> 01:09:36.825
"Almost like someone else
was staring back at her. Someone was.


983
01:09:36.837 --> 01:09:40.412
"She came across a slave crying
on account of massa's whip,


984
01:09:40.424 --> 01:09:44.666
"and looked down and see her wig
start drinking the blood from his wound.


985
01:09:44.678 --> 01:09:47.377
"'What kind of moss is this?' she say.

986
01:09:47.389 --> 01:09:50.588
"But with his dying breath,
he tell her, 'That ain't moss.


987
01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.550
"'That's the hair of witches
from the before time.


988
01:09:53.562 --> 01:09:57.762
"'They need blood to grow strong enough
to take over a person's body.


989
01:09:57.774 --> 01:10:00.277
"'Then, they can come back to the world.'

990
01:10:01.319 --> 01:10:02.934
"She ain't want to believe him,

991
01:10:02.946 --> 01:10:05.603
"but then she feel her hair
wrap around her neck,


992
01:10:05.615 --> 01:10:07.188
"and strangle her.

993
01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.025
"Even now, if you still see her
walking around them woods,


994
01:10:10.037 --> 01:10:12.819
"remember, it's only her body.

995
01:10:12.831 --> 01:10:15.250
The witches take turns in her head."

996
01:10:43.487 --> 01:10:44.863
Welcome, honey.

997
01:10:46.114 --> 01:10:48.480
Thank you for taking me last minute.

998
01:10:48.492 --> 01:10:50.106
All good.

999
01:10:50.118 --> 01:10:51.953
I had an opening, like I said.

1000
01:10:52.829 --> 01:10:55.195
This gon' take a while
to get all this out.


1001
01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:57.822
...first of all, okay,
'cause I know who my daddy is.


1002
01:10:57.834 --> 01:10:59.115
Couple hours.

1003
01:10:59.127 --> 01:11:00.659
- Okay.
- Okay.


1004
01:11:02.673 --> 01:11:03.995
All right, Coral.

1005
01:11:04.007 --> 01:11:06.802
Miss Thing better be ready,
'cause I don't have all night.


1006
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:09.596
Well...

1007
01:11:11.223 --> 01:11:13.392
I didn't know you went here, Edna.

1008
01:11:15.268 --> 01:11:19.552
Crowned is Black Hollywood's
secret weapon.


1009
01:11:19.564 --> 01:11:21.346
'Course, you'd know that if

1010
01:11:21.358 --> 01:11:24.027
you didn't have a thing
about people being in your hair.


1011
01:11:25.362 --> 01:11:26.893
If that were ever true.

1012
01:11:26.905 --> 01:11:29.771
- She's fucking killing me.
- Aisha will be out in a minute.


1013
01:11:29.783 --> 01:11:32.732
- No, I do. I have to go.
I told you that.


1014
01:11:32.744 --> 01:11:35.068
It's kind of funny seeing you here.

1015
01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.445
Damn, this is in here tight.

1016
01:11:37.457 --> 01:11:39.656
- Ow!
- Okay, hey, hey.


1017
01:11:39.668 --> 01:11:41.282
Don't go there with that.

1018
01:11:41.294 --> 01:11:44.631
I'm sorry. It hurts so bad.

1019
01:11:45.257 --> 01:11:47.872
- I fucked up.
- Jesus, Anna.


1020
01:11:47.884 --> 01:11:49.344
It's just hair.

1021
01:11:51.304 --> 01:11:53.473
Edna, I'm so sorry.

1022
01:11:54.474 --> 01:11:57.060
You were my friend and my mentor.

1023
01:11:58.937 --> 01:12:00.897
I just got caught up. I got...

1024
01:12:01.565 --> 01:12:03.096
really caught up.

1025
01:12:03.108 --> 01:12:04.568
I'm still caught up.

1026
01:12:06.611 --> 01:12:07.779
Ow.

1027
01:12:10.323 --> 01:12:11.825
You know I talk a lot of shit.

1028
01:12:12.701 --> 01:12:14.149
But the truth is,

1029
01:12:14.161 --> 01:12:18.111
I can't fault you for doing
whatever it takes


1030
01:12:18.123 --> 01:12:20.834
to get where they keep trying
to keep us from getting.


1031
01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.867
And fuck you. The hair looks good.

1032
01:12:25.005 --> 01:12:26.619
That's probably why I'm so mad.

1033
01:12:26.631 --> 01:12:29.080
You know, in a perfect world,

1034
01:12:29.092 --> 01:12:32.417
a woman would be able to wear her hair
the fuck the way she wants to.


1035
01:12:32.429 --> 01:12:34.306
Yeah. Yeah.

1036
01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:38.590
Well, if she wants another weave,
I ain't the one.


1037
01:12:41.521 --> 01:12:43.511
Can you put it
up in a bun, please?

1038
01:12:43.523 --> 01:12:44.763
What's that, darlin'?

1039
01:12:44.775 --> 01:12:48.266
Uh, just put it up
as tight as you can.

1040
01:12:48.278 --> 01:12:51.156
Uh, I don't want to yank it.
I'm tender headed.


1041
01:12:52.657 --> 01:12:54.731
Girl, I'm so sorry.

1042
01:12:54.743 --> 01:12:59.027
Y'all, this surfer nigga from Venice
got me so twisted. Mm.


1043
01:12:59.039 --> 01:13:02.155
I don't know. You got a surfer
colonizing your lands?


1044
01:13:02.167 --> 01:13:03.293
Oh, Lord.

1045
01:13:04.002 --> 01:13:05.629
- Be right back.
- Jesus.


1046
01:13:16.515 --> 01:13:17.545
Anna...

1047
01:13:19.101 --> 01:13:21.049
Oh, shit!

1048
01:13:25.148 --> 01:13:26.179
Aah!

1049
01:13:50.882 --> 01:13:52.372
Oh! Aah!

1050
01:13:52.384 --> 01:13:53.802
No!

1051
01:14:03.895 --> 01:14:06.428
It's Zora.
Can't come to the phone right now,


1052
01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:07.846
so please leave a message.

1053
01:14:07.858 --> 01:14:10.181
Truth be told,
I'm probably still at the office.


1054
01:14:47.856 --> 01:14:49.649
Oh, Sheryl!

1055
01:14:54.154 --> 01:14:55.364
Zora?

1056
01:14:58.658 --> 01:14:59.826
Anna.

1057
01:15:01.453 --> 01:15:03.205
Something bad has happened.

1058
01:15:05.123 --> 01:15:06.613
Oh, I'm aware.

1059
01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:08.335
It's happening to you, too.

1060
01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:12.839
What do you mean?

1061
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:15.175
How many lives has it taken?

1062
01:15:15.717 --> 01:15:18.583
It's so strange.

1063
01:15:18.595 --> 01:15:20.543
One moment you think
you recognize yourself,


1064
01:15:20.555 --> 01:15:24.142
and then the next
there's this rush of hunger.


1065
01:15:25.018 --> 01:15:28.468
Sheryl came in. 
All kind of job demands.

1066
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:33.056
Spelling out all of her strengths.
If only timing was one of them.


1067
01:15:33.068 --> 01:15:35.475
This is happening to other people?

1068
01:15:35.487 --> 01:15:37.686
Let me check with my killer weave
support group


1069
01:15:37.698 --> 01:15:39.187
and find out their sentiments.

1070
01:15:39.199 --> 01:15:41.982
I don't fucking know
what's happening with everyone else!


1071
01:15:41.994 --> 01:15:43.650
Now, who else have you told about this?

1072
01:15:43.662 --> 01:15:45.318
- No one!
- Of course not!


1073
01:15:45.330 --> 01:15:46.820
No one would fuckin' believe it!

1074
01:15:46.832 --> 01:15:48.947
That rush of hunger.

1075
01:15:48.959 --> 01:15:51.241
How often do you get it?

1076
01:15:51.253 --> 01:15:55.298
- At first, it was like, once in a while.
Then it started to be constant.


1077
01:15:56.675 --> 01:15:59.124
And some days it doesn't stop.

1078
01:15:59.136 --> 01:16:01.918
Do you get the dreams, too?

1079
01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:03.920
Oh, my God.

1080
01:16:03.932 --> 01:16:06.715
It's... It's trying to get in here.

1081
01:16:06.727 --> 01:16:09.479
It wants to take over us.

1082
01:16:12.482 --> 01:16:15.265
Fuck it. It's just hair.

1083
01:16:15.277 --> 01:16:17.600
Just... It's just hair.

1084
01:16:17.612 --> 01:16:20.092
- It won't let you! It won't let you!
- It's fucking just hair!


1085
01:16:23.493 --> 01:16:25.370
Aah! Aah!

1086
01:17:00.739 --> 01:17:02.074
Unc?

1087
01:17:06.078 --> 01:17:07.371
Anna.

1088
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:14.616
- What are you doing?
- I couldn't sleep. What's your excuse?


1089
01:17:14.628 --> 01:17:16.880
And how often do
you come by in the...

1090
01:17:17.881 --> 01:17:19.257
...dead of night?

1091
01:17:20.717 --> 01:17:22.874
Are you looking for anything
in particular?


1092
01:17:22.886 --> 01:17:25.627
Uh, the, um...

1093
01:17:25.639 --> 01:17:27.420
uh, moss haired girl.

1094
01:17:27.432 --> 01:17:29.422
Anything hair-related, really.

1095
01:17:29.434 --> 01:17:33.051
Yeah, so, this one has a few
hair stories in it.


1096
01:17:33.063 --> 01:17:35.387
It's mostly from American Indian tribes.

1097
01:17:35.399 --> 01:17:40.266
There are some tribes who believe that
a person's hair holds all their thoughts,


1098
01:17:40.278 --> 01:17:42.102
even after death.

1099
01:17:42.114 --> 01:17:44.938
The idea being that
one must have pure intentions,


1100
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:47.941
so that enemies can't use
the hair they leave behind


1101
01:17:47.953 --> 01:17:49.234
for evil spells.

1102
01:17:49.246 --> 01:17:52.988
"First, there was only the
wild beasts and the red man."


1103
01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.907
Do you think the moss tree story
could somehow be related?


1104
01:17:55.919 --> 01:18:00.662
Like, uh, maybe the hair in the tree
was enchanted, or...


1105
01:18:00.674 --> 01:18:01.674
I don't know.

1106
01:18:02.592 --> 01:18:03.957
It's fun to think about.

1107
01:18:03.969 --> 01:18:07.127
But didn't you say that
the native tribes of this land


1108
01:18:07.139 --> 01:18:09.963
and the ones brought here were wise
about things we've forgotten?


1109
01:18:09.975 --> 01:18:12.465
Things we consider... magic?

1110
01:18:12.477 --> 01:18:15.510
Sure. But the minute you start
supposing and what if-ing,


1111
01:18:15.522 --> 01:18:18.888
and now you've, you've, you've
stereotyped a whole group of people.


1112
01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:22.183
If there's something that
they were trying to warn us about,


1113
01:18:22.195 --> 01:18:24.561
or even, if there's something real, then...

1114
01:18:24.573 --> 01:18:26.033
We'd never know.

1115
01:18:27.576 --> 01:18:31.538
Conquerors don't write much
about the people they conquer.


1116
01:18:31.997 --> 01:18:33.457
What is this about?

1117
01:18:36.335 --> 01:18:38.378
I'm doing a segment. Um...

1118
01:18:39.338 --> 01:18:41.494
...inspired by you.

1119
01:18:41.506 --> 01:18:44.384
A little hair history thing.

1120
01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:48.221
That's very sweet.

1121
01:18:49.681 --> 01:18:53.226
Um, time to put this old man to bed.
Past my bedtime, so...


1122
01:18:54.895 --> 01:18:56.468
Always good to see you, honey.

1123
01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.219
- You, too.
- Mm.


1124
01:19:01.777 --> 01:19:03.236
You look...

1125
01:19:04.237 --> 01:19:05.280
...beautiful.

1126
01:19:11.328 --> 01:19:13.526
Hey, it's Anna.

1127
01:19:13.538 --> 01:19:15.528
Leave a message.

1128
01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:17.405
Anna, it's Rosalyn.

1129
01:19:17.417 --> 01:19:18.907
It's almost noon. 
Where are you?

1130
01:19:28.095 --> 01:19:32.057
Ooh. Not today, Satan. Not today.

1131
01:19:47.364 --> 01:19:50.117
Anna! Oh, thank God.

1132
01:19:50.742 --> 01:19:53.566
No one's been able to reach Zora.
Have you heard from her?


1133
01:19:55.706 --> 01:19:57.165
No.

1134
01:19:59.001 --> 01:20:00.657
Anna.

1135
01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:02.575
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.


1136
01:20:02.587 --> 01:20:05.578
No, I know. It's been so crazy.

1137
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:06.591
Anna...

1138
01:20:07.759 --> 01:20:09.261
We need a host.

1139
01:20:10.971 --> 01:20:12.669
You sure about the belt?

1140
01:20:12.681 --> 01:20:15.517
It's pristine. Nice heels.

1141
01:20:15.976 --> 01:20:18.270
- Thank you.
- It's time.


1142
01:20:29.156 --> 01:20:31.104
What's up, America?

1143
01:20:31.116 --> 01:20:34.107
I'm Anna Bludso, your host for today.

1144
01:20:34.119 --> 01:20:36.818
Now, if you've been watching
the promos,


1145
01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:39.404
I know you were expecting
someone a little taller,


1146
01:20:39.416 --> 01:20:41.406
a little more model-esque, but...

1147
01:20:41.418 --> 01:20:43.074
Psych! You got me!

1148
01:20:43.086 --> 01:20:46.161
Okay, all right, all right.

1149
01:20:46.173 --> 01:20:49.706
Welcome to Cult Live!

1150
01:20:59.019 --> 01:21:02.302
All the fans out here are going crazy.

1151
01:21:02.314 --> 01:21:04.846
You know why? 'Cause they want to know
who's got the number one spot.


1152
01:21:04.858 --> 01:21:08.600
Okay. Well, we're down to our top two.

1153
01:21:08.612 --> 01:21:11.269
- Who got it?
- What haven't we seen yet?


1154
01:21:11.281 --> 01:21:13.480
Well, you know, we ain't seen
"Break U" by The Fellas yet.


1155
01:21:13.492 --> 01:21:15.899
And you know I mess with The Fellas.
Sometimes.


1156
01:21:15.911 --> 01:21:21.321
Okay. Our number two video is...

1157
01:21:23.877 --> 01:21:26.660
Which means our number one video...

1158
01:21:26.672 --> 01:21:29.579
Wait, wait, wait!
Now, everyone at Cult knows


1159
01:21:29.591 --> 01:21:34.084
Anna is Sandra's biggest fan
in the whole world.


1160
01:21:34.096 --> 01:21:38.171
So, we thought we'd do something
special...


1161
01:21:38.183 --> 01:21:40.394
All right, sis. Do you mind?

1162
01:21:41.812 --> 01:21:44.356
And the number one video is...

1163
01:21:45.857 --> 01:21:47.263
Sorry Fellas...

1164
01:21:47.275 --> 01:21:49.265
"I Get It," by me!

1165
01:22:01.999 --> 01:22:03.834
And... commercial.

1166
01:22:13.802 --> 01:22:16.179
Goodnight. See you all tomorrow.

1167
01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.268
Zora.

1168
01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:34.728
Anna.

1169
01:22:34.740 --> 01:22:37.034
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.


1170
01:22:37.701 --> 01:22:40.025
Wow. You were...

1171
01:22:40.037 --> 01:22:43.111
- great.
- Ros, did you see Zora?


1172
01:22:43.123 --> 01:22:46.114
No, Anna. She's totally M. I. A.

1173
01:22:46.126 --> 01:22:48.199
I saw her looking out of that window.

1174
01:22:48.211 --> 01:22:51.536
I've been organizing her office
for hours. She's not here.


1175
01:22:51.548 --> 01:22:53.580
Ros, I saw her.

1176
01:22:53.592 --> 01:22:55.206
Anna...

1177
01:22:55.218 --> 01:22:56.416
there's something...

1178
01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:11.139
Ros?

1179
01:23:20.577 --> 01:23:21.620
Ro...

1180
01:25:18.737 --> 01:25:20.072
What's the code?

1181
01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:20.787
Help me!

1182
01:26:20.799 --> 01:26:23.093
Somebody help me! No!

1183
01:26:44.031 --> 01:26:45.145
Fuck!

1184
01:27:03.717 --> 01:27:06.291
Oh, shit! What the fuck!

1185
01:27:06.303 --> 01:27:07.709
Come on, man. I ain't one of them!

1186
01:27:07.721 --> 01:27:09.169
- You're not?
- No!


1187
01:27:09.181 --> 01:27:10.587
What were you doing upstairs?

1188
01:27:10.599 --> 01:27:12.088
I thought motherfuckers
was going up there to celebrate,


1189
01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:13.173
so shit, I went, too.

1190
01:27:13.185 --> 01:27:15.592
Shit, I was trying to blend in with these
zombie bitches to keep 'em at bay.


1191
01:27:15.604 --> 01:27:17.385
Brook, you gotta take this out.

1192
01:27:17.397 --> 01:27:19.679
I don't know the last time
you went to Virgie's...


1193
01:27:19.691 --> 01:27:21.931
- Virgie's?
Bitch, I ain't got $500 to give her!


1194
01:27:21.943 --> 01:27:24.184
Especially when La'Neka
hook a sister up for $250!


1195
01:27:24.196 --> 01:27:26.102
Look, I cannot die today, okay?

1196
01:27:26.114 --> 01:27:27.520
I haven't been to church
in like, 15 years.


1197
01:27:27.532 --> 01:27:29.814
Aah!

1198
01:27:29.826 --> 01:27:31.650
Aah!

1199
01:27:31.662 --> 01:27:32.485
Anna!

1200
01:27:32.497 --> 01:27:34.057
Shit.

1201
01:27:45.092 --> 01:27:47.719
Aah!
This bitch is trying to kill me!


1202
01:27:54.226 --> 01:27:55.769
Anna, cut this bitch!

1203
01:28:56.121 --> 01:28:58.236
Bitch, what is you doin'?

1204
01:28:58.248 --> 01:28:59.696
I done seen all the Jason movies.

1205
01:28:59.708 --> 01:29:01.323
You ain't gotta check to see
if she's dead!


1206
01:29:01.335 --> 01:29:02.502
Come on!

1207
01:29:07.716 --> 01:29:09.539
I should have died back there.

1208
01:29:09.551 --> 01:29:11.041
But I'll tell you what.

1209
01:29:11.053 --> 01:29:15.628
That crazy hoe had them blue eyes
directed on you. Okay?


1210
01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:18.000
Come on, come on, come on, come on...

1211
01:29:19.436 --> 01:29:22.344
Uh, h... Hey. Hey, hey, girl.

1212
01:29:22.356 --> 01:29:23.636
Hey.

1213
01:29:23.648 --> 01:29:25.013
Did you forget your coat?

1214
01:30:12.447 --> 01:30:13.447
Shit.

1215
01:30:16.076 --> 01:30:17.202
Shit.

1216
01:30:39.516 --> 01:30:43.061
Please, please, please.
Please, God. Please, somebody.


1217
01:30:43.687 --> 01:30:45.397
What the fuck?

1218
01:30:52.738 --> 01:30:54.072
Okay, okay, okay.

1219
01:33:20.093 --> 01:33:22.387
"Porcine albumin."

1220
01:33:32.272 --> 01:33:33.523
Pig's blood?

1221
01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.904
This is a fucking appetizer.

1222
01:33:41.908 --> 01:33:44.856
Oh, love your hair! Super cute.

1223
01:33:44.868 --> 01:33:46.483
Thanks. It's a little tight,

1224
01:33:46.495 --> 01:33:50.153
but hopefully my boyfriend
fucks it loose tonight.


1225
01:33:50.165 --> 01:33:51.708
I'm just kidding. 
I need it to last.

1226
01:33:55.003 --> 01:33:57.285
Okay, here's the last of it.

1227
01:33:57.297 --> 01:33:59.996
At least for me, it is.
Girl, I can't carry no more of your stuff.


1228
01:34:00.008 --> 01:34:01.831
What'd you pack in there? Bricks?

1229
01:34:01.843 --> 01:34:04.668
Oh, and before I forget to tell you,

1230
01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:07.671
I'm gonna be late for dinner tonight.
I'm doing something super top secret.


1231
01:34:07.683 --> 01:34:09.893
Can't tell you. Okay, fine.
Don't pull my leg...


1232
01:34:25.909 --> 01:34:28.817
"Even now, if you
see the moss haired girl

1233
01:34:28.829 --> 01:34:30.735
"walking around in them woods,

1234
01:34:30.747 --> 01:34:33.029
"remember, it's only her body.

1235
01:34:33.041 --> 01:34:36.003
The witches take turns in her head."

1236
01:35:01.319 --> 01:35:03.268
"As for massa,

1237
01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:05.687
"he was survived by two boys

1238
01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:09.274
"who would take over the land
and all that grew upon it,"


1239
01:35:09.286 --> 01:35:12.956
"including the hair that seemed like
moss on the trees."


1240
01:35:15.292 --> 01:35:17.157
"The way they saw it,

1241
01:35:17.169 --> 01:35:19.075
"as long as their name
was on the land,"


1242
01:35:19.087 --> 01:35:22.090
"they could do as they pleased
with anything that grew from it..."


1243
01:35:25.177 --> 01:35:26.970
"Whether it was plants..."

1244
01:35:27.846 --> 01:35:29.097
"Or people."

1245
01:35:32.809 --> 01:35:35.175
"If it grew on the land,
their daddy claimed..."


1246
01:35:37.522 --> 01:35:39.274
"They owned it."

1247
01:35:40.984 --> 01:35:43.195
"And it owned them."

1248
01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:48.533
Anna.

1249
01:35:49.659 --> 01:35:51.358
Um, what'd you say?

1250
01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:52.942
I said I may be late for dinner.

1251
01:35:52.954 --> 01:35:54.402
I finally got in at Virgie's!

1252
01:35:54.414 --> 01:35:57.364
Girl, I am so over this
Creamy Crack relaxer!


1253
01:35:57.376 --> 01:35:59.866
Just put someone else's hair
on my head and call it a day!


1254
01:35:59.878 --> 01:36:01.034
Linda!

1255
01:36:01.046 --> 01:36:02.589
Linda!
