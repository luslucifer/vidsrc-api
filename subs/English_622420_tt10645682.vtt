2
00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:35.551
Hello?

3
00:03:55.337 --> 00:03:56.340
Anyone here?

4
00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:18.996
Casey.

5
00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:21.731
I was actually trying
not to frighten you.


6
00:04:21.765 --> 00:04:23.600
Believe it or not, sorry.

7
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.701
It's okay.

8
00:04:25.735 --> 00:04:27.137
- You must be...
- Lisa.


9
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.342
Oh, I was expecting to
meet the manager, Rachel?


10
00:04:32.375 --> 00:04:34.544
You only meet Rachel if
you're being hired or fired,


11
00:04:34.577 --> 00:04:38.248
and she's pretty
trigger-happy at the moment.


12
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.448
So if she does pop in,

13
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:41.585
try not to fall asleep while
you're on shift or anything.


14
00:04:42.152 --> 00:04:43.654
I think I'll be all right.

15
00:04:45.755 --> 00:04:46.690
I'm assuming Rachel's
filled you in


16
00:04:46.722 --> 00:04:48.691
with all the details
regarding the exhibits?


17
00:04:49.224 --> 00:04:50.693
Yeah, she has, yeah.

18
00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:55.731
Okay, so this is the
war exhibit, obviously.


19
00:04:57.767 --> 00:04:59.403
Lovecraft is on your left,

20
00:04:59.436 --> 00:05:02.638
and the toy exhibit
is down the hall.


21
00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:04.707
Thanks, I'll take a look.

22
00:05:04.741 --> 00:05:06.642
Is it just us here today, or...?

23
00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:09.746
Yeah. From tomorrow you'll
mostly be working alone.


24
00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.582
I'm usually in here a
couple of days a week.


25
00:05:12.582 --> 00:05:14.217
And is it always this...

26
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.719
Quiet?

27
00:05:15.751 --> 00:05:18.388
Yeah, that's
a Monday morning for you.


28
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:23.060
It does tend to pick up, but
some days you'll only have


29
00:05:23.092 --> 00:05:24.460
these mannequins for company.

30
00:05:26.162 --> 00:05:27.765
Well, they seem friendly.

31
00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.400
Well, the job's simple enough.

32
00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:33.637
Just greet the visitors, smile.

33
00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.138
Answer any questions
they might have.


34
00:05:35.171 --> 00:05:38.408
And if you're lucky,
you won't be asked


35
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.743
to clear out the storeroom
by the end of the day.


36
00:05:41.777 --> 00:05:42.779
Like I have.

37
00:06:00.462 --> 00:06:02.465
- Clear it out?
- Yep.


38
00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.436
I'm gonna donate the bad stuff,

39
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:08.171
throw away the terrible stuff.

40
00:06:08.638 --> 00:06:09.772
We can't put it
all out on display,


41
00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:11.207
there's not enough room, so...

42
00:06:12.541 --> 00:06:13.743
Over the years, whatever
doesn't make the cut


43
00:06:13.775 --> 00:06:14.777
gets dumped in here.

44
00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:16.813
Where did it all come from?

45
00:06:16.845 --> 00:06:18.681
House clearances mostly.

46
00:06:18.715 --> 00:06:21.217
To be honest, I don't
know what half of it is.


47
00:06:23.652 --> 00:06:25.654
You have an original
James Harling.


48
00:06:25.688 --> 00:06:27.390
You have any idea
how rare this is?


49
00:06:27.423 --> 00:06:28.525
You into books, then?

50
00:06:28.558 --> 00:06:31.628
Yeah, books, antiques.

51
00:06:32.861 --> 00:06:35.664
I was a curator back in the US.

52
00:06:35.698 --> 00:06:36.733
I loved it.

53
00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:39.102
Why'd you move over here?

54
00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.705
Well, you have
everything over here.


55
00:06:41.738 --> 00:06:44.341
Rich history,
amazing architecture.


56
00:06:46.676 --> 00:06:50.279
But most of all, England
is a change of scenery.


57
00:06:54.584 --> 00:06:55.519
A fresh start.

58
00:06:59.722 --> 00:07:01.224
Well, if you fancy
lending a hand,


59
00:07:01.256 --> 00:07:03.325
we might find a few more
diamonds in the rough.


60
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.789
Hey, look at this.

61
00:08:07.323 --> 00:08:08.724
This is incredible.

62
00:08:12.996 --> 00:08:14.263
Open it up.

63
00:08:18.433 --> 00:08:19.602
It's locked.

64
00:08:20.537 --> 00:08:21.738
Do you think it needs
a key, or something?


65
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:22.772
No, I don't think so.

66
00:08:25.842 --> 00:08:27.377
What do you think it is?

67
00:08:28.443 --> 00:08:31.448
A music box?

68
00:08:31.481 --> 00:08:32.916
Maybe it's a Jack in the box.

69
00:08:32.948 --> 00:08:35.352
No there's no, um... handle.

70
00:08:38.955 --> 00:08:40.390
It's a combination.

71
00:08:58.675 --> 00:08:59.910
I don't know.

72
00:09:14.357 --> 00:09:15.926
It's a Jack in the box.

73
00:09:17.993 --> 00:09:22.599
But the question is,
is it gonna work?


74
00:09:23.532 --> 00:09:24.334
I don't know.

75
00:09:24.367 --> 00:09:25.402
Come on, yes or no.

76
00:09:25.435 --> 00:09:26.703
I hope not.

77
00:10:12.681 --> 00:10:14.017
That is creepy.

78
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.418
No, it's not.

79
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.518
This is supposed to be a toy.

80
00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:17.921
Would you let your
kids play with it?


81
00:10:17.954 --> 00:10:19.489
It has to be out
there on display.


82
00:10:21.724 --> 00:10:24.060
I'm gonna give David a
ring, he's our expert.


83
00:10:24.093 --> 00:10:26.430
He'll be able to tell if
this is the real deal or not.


84
00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:35.772
Hi David, it's Lisa from
Hawthorne Museum, how are you?


85
00:10:36.906 --> 00:10:37.907
Yeah, good.

86
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.875
Listen, we've got a piece
that we'd love for you


87
00:10:39.908 --> 00:10:40.943
to come and take a look at.

88
00:10:40.976 --> 00:10:42.111
Are you available today?

89
00:10:44.614 --> 00:10:47.083
He's free to pop in
tomorrow, I won't be here.


90
00:10:47.115 --> 00:10:48.884
Are you up to it?

91
00:10:48.917 --> 00:10:49.985
Yeah, I'd love to.

92
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.755
Yeah, that sounds great.

93
00:10:52.788 --> 00:10:53.989
Listen, I'm not gonna be around.

94
00:10:54.022 --> 00:10:55.959
We have someone new.

95
00:11:11.007 --> 00:11:13.609
You take downstairs,
I'll take upstairs.


96
00:11:13.642 --> 00:11:15.945
Meet down here in 10
minutes, all right?


97
00:11:35.797 --> 00:11:38.000
Look at the state of you.

98
00:11:40.101 --> 00:11:41.670
You gotta come see this thing!

99
00:11:42.104 --> 00:11:43.940
Just take it, hurry up!

100
00:11:50.146 --> 00:11:51.815
God, you are ugly.

101
00:11:54.649 --> 00:11:55.818
Look at your nose.

102
00:12:01.724 --> 00:12:02.825
You're coming with me.

103
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:49.072
Three minutes,
then we're out of here!


104
00:12:55.011 --> 00:12:56.246
Come on, let's go!

105
00:14:13.254 --> 00:14:14.790
Thank you.

106
00:14:14.824 --> 00:14:16.126
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


107
00:14:19.161 --> 00:14:21.330
Thought this place might
remind you of home.


108
00:14:21.364 --> 00:14:22.264
What do you think?

109
00:14:24.633 --> 00:14:26.969
Well, ask me again once
I've tried the food.


110
00:14:28.771 --> 00:14:31.608
Okay, so the pancakes
here are to die for.


111
00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:32.309
Trust me.

112
00:14:35.311 --> 00:14:36.646
This is probably the
closest I'll ever get


113
00:14:36.679 --> 00:14:39.115
to a real American diner.

114
00:14:39.147 --> 00:14:42.652
I've got this crazy
phobia of flying.


115
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.189
Okay guys,
what're we having?


116
00:14:47.288 --> 00:14:51.193
Uh, I guess the
pancakes then, please.


117
00:14:51.226 --> 00:14:53.795
Make
that two, please.


118
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:55.231
Good choice.

119
00:14:55.263 --> 00:14:56.332
Thank you.

120
00:14:58.234 --> 00:14:59.268
See?

121
00:15:00.703 --> 00:15:01.338
Oh come on.

122
00:15:02.671 --> 00:15:03.806
Well, she says
that to everybody.


123
00:15:04.773 --> 00:15:06.676
No, it's 'cause she
knows they're good.


124
00:15:07.843 --> 00:15:10.013
Pancakes, good choice, huh?

125
00:15:10.046 --> 00:15:12.215
Waffles, wonderful decision.

126
00:15:12.248 --> 00:15:13.983
Just a glass of water
for me today, please.


127
00:15:14.016 --> 00:15:15.318
Oh, good selection.

128
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:16.885
Gotta watch that calorie count.

129
00:15:18.387 --> 00:15:19.287
You said more in the
last five seconds


130
00:15:19.321 --> 00:15:21.056
than you said the
whole day put together.


131
00:15:24.793 --> 00:15:26.195
Just had a lot on
my mind lately.


132
00:15:27.897 --> 00:15:29.232
Everything all right?

133
00:15:32.067 --> 00:15:35.204
I haven't had a full night's
sleep for six months.


134
00:15:39.742 --> 00:15:40.777
It's taking its toll.

135
00:15:47.883 --> 00:15:50.719
So, tell me about yourself.

136
00:15:55.291 --> 00:15:56.926
Not much to tell.

137
00:15:57.926 --> 00:15:59.262
Well, that can't be true.

138
00:16:00.796 --> 00:16:04.133
I'm a Hawthorne girl,
born and raised.


139
00:16:06.801 --> 00:16:07.436
And that's it?

140
00:16:08.437 --> 00:16:10.340
There's more to you than
just where you're from.


141
00:16:12.074 --> 00:16:14.109
Ask me a question.

142
00:16:14.142 --> 00:16:18.147
Okay, well
what's your plan?


143
00:16:19.415 --> 00:16:20.349
Plan?

144
00:16:20.383 --> 00:16:23.386
Yeah, you know, like
career plan, life plan.


145
00:16:23.418 --> 00:16:26.755
Where do you imagine
yourself, five year's time.


146
00:16:27.422 --> 00:16:29.758
Here.

147
00:16:29.791 --> 00:16:30.392
Really?

148
00:16:30.426 --> 00:16:32.929
Yeah, why not?

149
00:16:32.961 --> 00:16:34.431
This is all I
know, I'll be here.


150
00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:36.832
What about career?

151
00:16:39.335 --> 00:16:40.737
You're not getting
the message are you?


152
00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:41.403
I'm happy.

153
00:16:43.405 --> 00:16:46.776
Surely you don't plan on
staying at the museum?


154
00:16:46.809 --> 00:16:48.077
Why not?

155
00:16:48.109 --> 00:16:49.778
It's a one minute
walk from my house.


156
00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:51.748
15 second run if I'm late.

157
00:16:51.781 --> 00:16:55.151
But you've shown
no real interest.


158
00:16:55.184 --> 00:16:57.420
You have no knowledge
of the exhibits.


159
00:16:57.453 --> 00:17:01.124
It doesn't seem like your
heart is exactly in it.


160
00:17:03.158 --> 00:17:05.994
Look, I wanna travel the world.

161
00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:08.965
And grow my knowledge
of this industry.


162
00:17:10.132 --> 00:17:11.934
I just wondered
what your future...


163
00:17:11.966 --> 00:17:13.202
I don't know.

164
00:17:18.139 --> 00:17:22.277
If you really wanna go
there, I hate antiques,


165
00:17:22.311 --> 00:17:25.047
I hate history, I hate
my other part-time jobs.


166
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.250
I'm just there for the money.

167
00:17:30.151 --> 00:17:32.921
Nothing else really
matters right now.


168
00:17:35.991 --> 00:17:40.997
I didn't mean to upset you.

169
00:17:47.168 --> 00:17:50.072
There's no five
year plan, Casey.


170
00:17:52.407 --> 00:17:54.543
Not even a plan for what
tomorrow might bring.


171
00:18:00.515 --> 00:18:01.850
My mom's sick.

172
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.421
I'm sorry to hear that.

173
00:18:09.925 --> 00:18:12.861
I lie awake every night,

174
00:18:14.096 --> 00:18:15.932
terrified that the
phone's gonna ring,


175
00:18:15.965 --> 00:18:18.268
and it's gonna be someone
telling me that she's gone.


176
00:18:22.503 --> 00:18:24.340
I know how you feel.

177
00:18:33.581 --> 00:18:34.416
Thank you.

178
00:18:37.418 --> 00:18:39.388
This
looks incredible.


179
00:18:40.188 --> 00:18:41.023
Told ya.

180
00:19:08.416 --> 00:19:09.551
Casey, my phone is about to die.

181
00:19:09.584 --> 00:19:11.553
Please, please come
and pick me up.


182
00:19:11.587 --> 00:19:15.324
I'm alone and someone
is following me.


183
00:19:15.357 --> 00:19:16.993
I'm so scared.

184
00:19:18.026 --> 00:19:19.494
There's a guy behind me.

185
00:19:21.263 --> 00:19:22.531
I think he's got a knife.

186
00:19:22.563 --> 00:19:24.566
Oh God Casey, please pick up.

187
00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:26.269
Please pick up.

188
00:20:22.224 --> 00:20:23.960
<i>God, do you
know what time it is?</i>


189
00:20:23.993 --> 00:20:25.695
<i>It's my day off, Casey.</i>

190
00:20:25.727 --> 00:20:28.931
Yeah, I think there may have
been a break-in last night.


191
00:20:30.432 --> 00:20:31.200
<i>Seriously?</i>

192
00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:36.339
Well, the door is open, and
there's stuff everywhere.


193
00:20:38.173 --> 00:20:38.974
<i>Oh God.</i>

194
00:20:39.007 --> 00:20:40.042
<i>Is anything missing?</i>

195
00:20:41.676 --> 00:20:43.346
Nothing I can see
from the great hall.


196
00:20:43.378 --> 00:20:45.580
But, how do I check
the CCTV footage?


197
00:20:47.282 --> 00:20:48.184
<i>You can't.</i>

198
00:20:49.618 --> 00:20:50.586
Why not?

199
00:20:51.285 --> 00:20:54.255
<i>Because Rachel was
too cheap to get it fixed.</i>


200
00:20:54.289 --> 00:20:57.093
<i>God, I told her this would
happen, she never listens.</i>


201
00:20:57.126 --> 00:20:58.127
You must be David.

202
00:20:59.028 --> 00:21:00.363
I'll call again later, okay?

203
00:21:01.195 --> 00:21:02.263
<i>Okay, all right, bye.</i>

204
00:21:02.297 --> 00:21:03.266
All right, bye.

205
00:21:03.765 --> 00:21:05.166
Thanks for coming in.

206
00:21:05.199 --> 00:21:06.267
My pleasure.

207
00:21:06.301 --> 00:21:07.136
This way.

208
00:21:15.077 --> 00:21:17.113
It's an
incredible piece.


209
00:21:17.146 --> 00:21:19.615
Have you ever come across
one of these before?


210
00:21:21.215 --> 00:21:23.519
No, unless you're including
my grandson's toy box.


211
00:21:26.054 --> 00:21:28.423
There's no questioning
its authenticity,


212
00:21:29.457 --> 00:21:30.292
it's quality.

213
00:21:33.095 --> 00:21:35.564
The condition of the
brass and its design


214
00:21:35.597 --> 00:21:39.568
suggests that it was built in
the mid to late Victorian era.


215
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.070
I didn't know they Jack
in boxes back then.


216
00:21:42.103 --> 00:21:43.571
Well, the origins of
the Jack in the box


217
00:21:43.605 --> 00:21:46.208
have been argued
over for centuries.


218
00:21:46.241 --> 00:21:47.743
Some people say they
were simply toys


219
00:21:47.775 --> 00:21:50.345
that gained popularity
in the late 1800s.


220
00:21:52.447 --> 00:21:54.617
Others suggest they served
a far darker purpose


221
00:21:54.649 --> 00:21:55.584
many years before that.

222
00:21:56.418 --> 00:22:00.089
What do you mean
by "darker purpose?"


223
00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:04.060
There's evidence that suggests
that Jack in the boxes


224
00:22:04.092 --> 00:22:07.763
were originally built in France
to contain evil entities.


225
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:12.167
They had a different
name for them.


226
00:22:14.102 --> 00:22:15.804
<i>Demon en boite.</i>

227
00:22:18.773 --> 00:22:21.743
Demon in a box.

228
00:22:22.578 --> 00:22:25.147
Moving ever so clearly away
the facts and into legends here,


229
00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:29.351
look, these boxes were
meant to look harmless.


230
00:22:30.452 --> 00:22:31.753
Enticing, even, to open.

231
00:22:32.687 --> 00:22:33.688
They were spread across

232
00:22:33.723 --> 00:22:37.426
Northern France in
reaction to a satanic panic.


233
00:22:37.458 --> 00:22:38.760
It was thought to be
an act of revenge


234
00:22:38.793 --> 00:22:40.128
from the murdered hundreds

235
00:22:40.161 --> 00:22:41.763
found guilty of
practicing the dark arts.


236
00:22:43.799 --> 00:22:45.468
Once these boxes were opened,

237
00:22:47.301 --> 00:22:48.536
the demon within would be

238
00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.839
unleashed on all
those around it.


239
00:22:51.139 --> 00:22:51.773
How?

240
00:22:53.175 --> 00:22:56.145
I specialize in
antiques, not fantasy.


241
00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:03.186
The real question, Casey...

242
00:23:05.786 --> 00:23:07.188
is what the hell
were they drinking


243
00:23:07.222 --> 00:23:09.358
when they came up
with this stuff?


244
00:23:11.859 --> 00:23:13.361
Do you know anyone
that would have


245
00:23:13.395 --> 00:23:15.664
more information
about the demon?


246
00:23:15.696 --> 00:23:17.699
I'm sure our visitors
will be as curious


247
00:23:17.733 --> 00:23:20.336
as I am about the mythology.

248
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:24.706
Maurice, something
or other, I forget.


249
00:23:25.573 --> 00:23:26.841
He's about the only
well-known figure over here


250
00:23:26.875 --> 00:23:28.811
in the field of demonology.

251
00:23:28.843 --> 00:23:30.778
If you can call it a field.

252
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.416
Thank you.

253
00:23:33.849 --> 00:23:34.684
Thank you.

254
00:24:25.399 --> 00:24:26.936
Late night?

255
00:24:26.968 --> 00:24:27.802
I'm sorry.

256
00:24:28.837 --> 00:24:31.540
Can you tell me where the
war exhibit is, please?


257
00:24:31.572 --> 00:24:32.874
Do you want me to show you?

258
00:24:32.907 --> 00:24:33.708
Oh no, it's fine.

259
00:24:33.742 --> 00:24:35.844
Just point me in
the right direction.


260
00:24:35.877 --> 00:24:41.317
Go through this door, up
the stairs, and turn right.


261
00:24:41.349 --> 00:24:42.283
Thanks.

262
00:24:42.317 --> 00:24:43.419
You're welcome.

263
00:25:42.977 --> 00:25:43.812
The lights have gone off.

264
00:25:47.882 --> 00:25:49.951
I'm getting a bit
claustrophobic in here.


265
00:26:28.522 --> 00:26:29.457
Hello?

266
00:26:43.371 --> 00:26:44.572
Anyone in here?

267
00:28:01.449 --> 00:28:03.785
Two more can't hurt, can it?

268
00:28:45.926 --> 00:28:47.796
Can you tell me where the
war exhibit is, please?


269
00:28:48.397 --> 00:28:49.498
Do you want
me to show you?


270
00:28:49.532 --> 00:28:52.134
No, it's fine, just point
me in the right direction.


271
00:29:48.622 --> 00:29:52.693
Name, Jackestemarra, Jack.

272
00:29:52.726 --> 00:29:55.163
Type, demonic clown.

273
00:29:55.863 --> 00:29:58.199
Height, six to to
seven feet tall.


274
00:29:58.233 --> 00:29:59.068
Ah, profile.

275
00:30:01.235 --> 00:30:04.039
A Jack is summoned through
the act of opening the box


276
00:30:04.071 --> 00:30:06.140
in which it is contained.

277
00:30:06.174 --> 00:30:09.610
It is believed Jacks adopt
the appearance of clowns


278
00:30:09.644 --> 00:30:11.814
to toy with our deepest fears.

279
00:30:16.818 --> 00:30:21.824
Goals, to feast on the
remains of six human victims.


280
00:30:22.924 --> 00:30:26.962
Only when a Jack
claims his six victims


281
00:30:26.994 --> 00:30:30.099
will it once again be
trapped within the box.


282
00:31:07.301 --> 00:31:07.969
Casey.

283
00:31:09.803 --> 00:31:10.738
Yeah.

284
00:31:11.805 --> 00:31:13.107
I'm Rachel, the manager.

285
00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.208
We spoke on the phone.

286
00:31:14.242 --> 00:31:15.644
It's great to finally meet you.

287
00:31:15.676 --> 00:31:16.579
Likewise.

288
00:31:17.545 --> 00:31:19.747
Well, how're you finding
it down here so far?


289
00:31:20.849 --> 00:31:22.250
Can't complain.

290
00:31:22.282 --> 00:31:24.785
This place is a
history geek's dream.


291
00:31:24.819 --> 00:31:26.622
That's good to hear.

292
00:31:26.655 --> 00:31:29.124
Can you please make sure
the building is locked


293
00:31:29.157 --> 00:31:30.125
before you go home at night.

294
00:31:30.157 --> 00:31:33.128
Yeah, I didn't leave it
open the other night.


295
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.129
I'm sure someone
must have broken in.


296
00:31:35.163 --> 00:31:36.765
There's nothing missing, Casey.

297
00:31:39.099 --> 00:31:41.637
Yeah, fair enough, yeah.

298
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:44.171
I just popped by to collect
some papers, so I'll be off.


299
00:31:44.205 --> 00:31:45.240
Nice meeting you.

300
00:31:45.272 --> 00:31:46.241
Nice meeting you.

301
00:31:46.273 --> 00:31:47.208
One last thing.

302
00:31:47.242 --> 00:31:49.845
Would you please put
that on display today?


303
00:31:50.945 --> 00:31:52.748
There's a space
cleared for it, ready,


304
00:31:52.781 --> 00:31:53.882
in the toy exhibit.

305
00:31:55.183 --> 00:31:56.018
Sure.

306
00:31:57.318 --> 00:31:58.253
It's a great find.

307
00:32:53.273 --> 00:32:55.243
Hey guys, just to let
you know it's five o'clock,


308
00:32:55.275 --> 00:32:57.079
and we're about to close, okay?

309
00:33:18.166 --> 00:33:19.067
Have a good weekend.

310
00:33:19.099 --> 00:33:19.935
You too.

311
00:34:07.348 --> 00:34:11.286
Who would let their
child anywhere near you?


312
00:34:19.827 --> 00:34:21.129
Ha!

313
00:34:22.497 --> 00:34:24.066
You'll have to
be quicker than that.


314
00:35:35.035 --> 00:35:35.604
Help!

315
00:36:12.205 --> 00:36:13.908
<i>I need
you to call me back,</i>


316
00:36:13.941 --> 00:36:18.946
<i>it's urgent.</i>

317
00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:31.358
<i>Casey my phone is about to die.</i>

318
00:36:31.392 --> 00:36:34.428
<i>Please, please come
and pick me up.</i>


319
00:36:34.461 --> 00:36:37.565
<i>I'm alone and someone
is following me.</i>


320
00:36:38.298 --> 00:36:39.367
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

321
00:36:40.501 --> 00:36:42.137
<i>There's a guy behind me.</i>

322
00:36:43.303 --> 00:36:44.939
<i>He's got a knife.</i>

323
00:36:44.972 --> 00:36:47.441
<i>Oh God, Casey, please pick up.</i>

324
00:36:47.475 --> 00:36:48.944
<i>Please pick up.</i>

325
00:36:48.977 --> 00:36:50.412
<i>Casey, Casey!</i>

326
00:37:05.526 --> 00:37:07.462
I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to listen.


327
00:37:07.495 --> 00:37:08.296
It's fine.

328
00:37:08.329 --> 00:37:09.597
I hardly heard anything.

329
00:37:10.664 --> 00:37:12.066
Don't worry about it.

330
00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.168
I shouldn't have played it here.

331
00:37:15.035 --> 00:37:16.370
Was that your girlfriend?

332
00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:19.573
Fiance.

333
00:37:23.644 --> 00:37:25.379
Didn't know you were engaged.

334
00:37:28.182 --> 00:37:31.352
I was, until I
received that call


335
00:37:31.385 --> 00:37:32.521
in the middle of the night.

336
00:37:35.756 --> 00:37:37.124
I feel so guilty.

337
00:37:38.292 --> 00:37:39.127
Why?

338
00:37:43.064 --> 00:37:45.100
She called me when
she was in trouble.


339
00:37:47.234 --> 00:37:48.470
I was in bed and I...

340
00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:54.443
<i>...ignored the call.</i>

341
00:38:08.388 --> 00:38:10.091
Now I have a voicemail
that'll haunt me


342
00:38:10.124 --> 00:38:11.392
for the rest of my life.

343
00:38:20.734 --> 00:38:21.702
I could have helped her.

344
00:38:40.254 --> 00:38:41.089
We're closed.

345
00:38:41.122 --> 00:38:42.724
Come back in half an hour.

346
00:38:42.756 --> 00:38:44.124
Morning.

347
00:38:44.158 --> 00:38:45.093
I'm DCI Martin.

348
00:38:45.126 --> 00:38:48.263
I'm investigating a
missing person report.


349
00:38:48.296 --> 00:38:49.431
Who's missing?

350
00:38:49.463 --> 00:38:50.764
Mandy Hinchley.

351
00:38:50.798 --> 00:38:52.667
I believe she does
the cleaning here.


352
00:38:53.733 --> 00:38:54.568
Yeah.

353
00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:57.571
Well, Mandy hasn't been
seen for over 48 hours.


354
00:38:57.604 --> 00:38:58.639
When did you last see her?

355
00:39:00.508 --> 00:39:02.577
Well, I didn't see Mandy
for a week at least,


356
00:39:02.609 --> 00:39:04.579
but I'm only here
a couple of days.


357
00:39:04.611 --> 00:39:06.280
I saw her last thing on Friday.

358
00:39:06.314 --> 00:39:07.616
I closed that evening.

359
00:39:08.582 --> 00:39:10.751
Can I come in and ask
you some questions?


360
00:39:11.686 --> 00:39:12.720
Sure.

361
00:39:19.861 --> 00:39:23.263
Thanks very much for taking
the time out to talk to me.


362
00:39:23.296 --> 00:39:26.300
I'm sure you can understand the
seriousness of this inquiry.


363
00:39:27.667 --> 00:39:29.771
Mandy Hinchley is the
fourth person to go missing


364
00:39:29.803 --> 00:39:31.072
in Hawthorne this week.

365
00:39:32.472 --> 00:39:36.544
So let's start with the
last time you saw her, okay?


366
00:39:37.745 --> 00:39:39.781
Now when you left the
building on Friday,


367
00:39:39.814 --> 00:39:40.649
was she alone?

368
00:39:41.849 --> 00:39:44.285
Yeah, as far as I'm aware.

369
00:39:44.318 --> 00:39:45.653
You're not sure?

370
00:39:45.686 --> 00:39:48.122
We have very few
visitors in the winter.


371
00:39:48.155 --> 00:39:50.624
I always check the
building and make sure


372
00:39:50.658 --> 00:39:52.460
it's empty before I leave.

373
00:39:52.492 --> 00:39:54.261
So it's possible
she wasn't alone.


374
00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:58.399
Yeah, it's possible.

375
00:40:01.769 --> 00:40:03.238
So how would you
describe Mandy's demeanor


376
00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:04.673
the last time you saw her?

377
00:40:06.707 --> 00:40:11.312
She seemed normal, happy.

378
00:40:11.345 --> 00:40:13.814
I don't know her all
too well, but you know.


379
00:40:13.847 --> 00:40:15.349
Nothing stood out as unusual.

380
00:40:16.684 --> 00:40:18.753
Has there been any conflict
between staff members?


381
00:40:20.421 --> 00:40:21.756
No, no.

382
00:40:22.856 --> 00:40:25.626
Anything that happened out
of the ordinary, perhaps?


383
00:40:33.867 --> 00:40:36.203
Mister Reynolds, is there
something you wanna tell me?


384
00:40:40.707 --> 00:40:43.610
Look, if I'm being
totally honest.


385
00:40:43.644 --> 00:40:45.780
That afternoon I
encountered something...


386
00:40:48.883 --> 00:40:50.352
...weird.

387
00:40:51.618 --> 00:40:52.887
What happened?

388
00:40:52.919 --> 00:40:54.455
Can you break it down for me?

389
00:40:56.289 --> 00:41:00.794
I was here alone all day,
bar a handful of visitors.


390
00:41:00.827 --> 00:41:04.798
I was in the room across
the hall, and I saw...


391
00:41:12.272 --> 00:41:13.240
What did you see?

392
00:41:25.919 --> 00:41:28.822
Nothing, I'm rambling.

393
00:41:28.856 --> 00:41:30.492
This news has hit
me really hard.


394
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:34.428
I'm sorry I can't
be more of a help.


395
00:41:35.997 --> 00:41:36.830
It's fine.

396
00:41:38.832 --> 00:41:41.401
Maybe you better take
some time off, you know?


397
00:41:41.434 --> 00:41:42.703
Clear your head.

398
00:41:43.937 --> 00:41:46.340
Yeah, I'll have a
word with my boss.


399
00:41:47.041 --> 00:41:47.876
Okay.

400
00:41:48.776 --> 00:41:51.913
I just need the CCTV
footage for review, please?


401
00:41:51.946 --> 00:41:55.650
Yeah, there is no CCTV here.

402
00:41:55.682 --> 00:41:57.484
But I saw two cameras
in the main hall.


403
00:41:57.517 --> 00:42:00.354
Yeah, the system went down
long before I started here.


404
00:42:00.387 --> 00:42:01.922
You'll have to take
that up with Rachel.


405
00:42:01.955 --> 00:42:05.459
Rachel Thompson, she's
the manager here, not me.


406
00:42:09.363 --> 00:42:10.298
Okay.

407
00:42:11.865 --> 00:42:15.702
Well, that's my direct line.

408
00:42:15.736 --> 00:42:18.539
You can think of anything
else regarding Mandy Hinchley,


409
00:42:18.571 --> 00:42:19.506
give me a call, yeah?

410
00:42:20.975 --> 00:42:21.810
Will do.

411
00:42:24.044 --> 00:42:25.579
Thanks.

412
00:42:30.017 --> 00:42:30.952
Before you go.

413
00:42:35.088 --> 00:42:36.357
Can I ask you something?

414
00:42:38.059 --> 00:42:39.026
Sure.

415
00:42:41.495 --> 00:42:43.498
Forgive me if I
sound a little crazy.


416
00:42:49.437 --> 00:42:51.306
Do you believe in
the supernatural?


417
00:42:51.338 --> 00:42:53.007
Paranormal, that type of thing?

418
00:42:53.974 --> 00:42:55.276
Why do you ask?

419
00:42:56.243 --> 00:42:57.979
Have you ever had a
case where you suspected


420
00:42:58.012 --> 00:43:02.684
there was something, you
know, supernatural involved?


421
00:43:02.716 --> 00:43:06.320
Just out of curiosity.

422
00:43:08.189 --> 00:43:11.725
Well, now, the interrogation
room is a funny old place.


423
00:43:11.758 --> 00:43:15.729
Murder suspects have told
me insane, crazy tales.


424
00:43:15.762 --> 00:43:17.998
All about witches and demons.

425
00:43:18.999 --> 00:43:21.802
But the funny thing is, they
all have one thing in common.


426
00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:25.006
These suspects,
well, they always


427
00:43:25.039 --> 00:43:27.075
portray themselves as victims.

428
00:43:28.642 --> 00:43:31.044
Now, I learned
very early on that


429
00:43:31.077 --> 00:43:32.646
the crazier these tales are,

430
00:43:33.814 --> 00:43:34.782
well, the more the
suspect's trying to


431
00:43:34.814 --> 00:43:36.318
bury the truth in the sand.

432
00:43:38.618 --> 00:43:40.854
If someone disappears off
the face of the earth,


433
00:43:41.955 --> 00:43:44.059
there's always a
logical explanation.


434
00:43:46.426 --> 00:43:47.861
There's always
someone behind it.


435
00:43:50.731 --> 00:43:51.566
All right.

436
00:43:53.934 --> 00:43:54.868
Thanks for your time.

437
00:44:06.847 --> 00:44:07.580
<i>Please leave your message</i>

438
00:44:07.615 --> 00:44:09.484
<i>after the tone.</i>

439
00:44:09.517 --> 00:44:11.551
Hi, my name is Casey Reynolds.

440
00:44:11.584 --> 00:44:14.388
I'm hoping to talk
to Maurice Ainsworth.


441
00:44:14.421 --> 00:44:16.557
I'm part of the team at
the Hawthorne Museum.


442
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:20.961
I believe we've been
donated something... unusual,


443
00:44:20.995 --> 00:44:24.031
and I think only someone
with your expertise


444
00:44:24.064 --> 00:44:27.033
will be able to tell is what
it is we have on our hands.


445
00:44:27.066 --> 00:44:28.902
If you could call me
back as soon as possible,


446
00:44:28.936 --> 00:44:30.771
I would really,
really appreciate it.


447
00:44:57.465 --> 00:44:58.432
<i>Hello.</i>

448
00:44:58.466 --> 00:44:59.934
Andy, it's Casey.

449
00:45:00.533 --> 00:45:03.104
<i>Long time, how's things?</i>

450
00:45:03.137 --> 00:45:04.805
Yeah, I've been better.

451
00:45:04.838 --> 00:45:07.174
Look, can I ask you a favor?

452
00:45:07.207 --> 00:45:08.108
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>

453
00:45:08.142 --> 00:45:09.811
What's the bare minimum you need

454
00:45:09.843 --> 00:45:11.879
to track down someone's address?

455
00:45:13.146 --> 00:45:15.782
<i>Well, a full
name and a phone number</i>


456
00:45:15.816 --> 00:45:17.452
<i>should just be enough.</i>

457
00:45:17.484 --> 00:45:21.522
I'm trying to locate Maurice
Ainsworth. It's a UK number.


458
00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:27.595
01574-482-453.

459
00:45:28.495 --> 00:45:29.964
If you can do it by
this time tomorrow,


460
00:45:29.997 --> 00:45:32.166
I'll pay you double.

461
00:45:32.198 --> 00:45:34.034
<i>Yeah, yeah, that's fine.</i>

462
00:45:34.068 --> 00:45:35.136
<i>I'll have it by then.</i>

463
00:45:35.169 --> 00:45:36.471
Thank you.

464
00:45:36.504 --> 00:45:37.505
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

465
00:47:01.588 --> 00:47:04.591
Come on, come on.

466
00:47:54.742 --> 00:47:55.943
Maybe we should take
you to the hospital.


467
00:47:55.975 --> 00:47:58.245
I'm not going anywhere
until you've seen this.


468
00:48:02.082 --> 00:48:02.917
Just watch.

469
00:48:14.294 --> 00:48:15.896
- Dammit.
- Casey.


470
00:48:15.928 --> 00:48:17.999
No, you need to see this.

471
00:48:18.032 --> 00:48:19.300
- Come on.
- Can we just relax?


472
00:48:19.332 --> 00:48:20.200
No!

473
00:48:20.233 --> 00:48:22.169
Jesus Casey, what is
going on with you?


474
00:48:23.171 --> 00:48:26.340
What if Mandy never left
the museum Friday night?


475
00:48:26.372 --> 00:48:28.141
What if something
happened to her here?


476
00:48:29.309 --> 00:48:31.012
What, you think
she was murdered?


477
00:48:31.044 --> 00:48:34.014
I can't get what the expert,
David, said out of my head.


478
00:48:34.914 --> 00:48:38.351
The box, it's not what
we thought it was.


479
00:48:38.385 --> 00:48:42.923
He said it was built
to contain a demon.


480
00:48:42.955 --> 00:48:44.892
And by opening the
box, I let it out.


481
00:48:52.099 --> 00:48:53.700
Oh Jesus Christ.

482
00:48:53.733 --> 00:48:55.335
This video would have proven it.

483
00:48:55.368 --> 00:48:56.236
But it hasn't.

484
00:48:56.269 --> 00:48:57.370
But there's nothing there.

485
00:48:57.405 --> 00:48:59.740
All I can see is a Jack in
the box behind some glass.


486
00:48:59.772 --> 00:49:01.175
I saw it with my own two eyes.

487
00:49:01.207 --> 00:49:03.010
- It came out of the box.
- You saw it.


488
00:49:03.042 --> 00:49:04.245
Yeah, look what it did to me.

489
00:49:12.051 --> 00:49:14.387
You know that's not
possible, don't you?


490
00:49:14.421 --> 00:49:19.060
I saw it, you have
to listen to me.


491
00:49:28.401 --> 00:49:30.838
I think your insomnia is
playing tricks with your mind.


492
00:49:35.374 --> 00:49:36.209
No.

493
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:39.379
- It's not.
- You sure?


494
00:49:45.885 --> 00:49:46.720
Are you sure?

495
00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:54.394
Mandy told me that she was
going through some stuff,


496
00:49:54.428 --> 00:49:56.430
like relationship stuff.

497
00:49:56.463 --> 00:50:00.167
She said she wanted to run
away and leave it all behind.


498
00:50:02.336 --> 00:50:05.006
She'll come to her
senses, she'll come home.


499
00:50:09.443 --> 00:50:12.245
I'm fine here for
the rest of the day.


500
00:50:12.278 --> 00:50:14.815
You go home and get some sleep.

501
00:50:18.017 --> 00:50:18.852
No.

502
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:44.812
11 Dunan Close.

503
00:50:46.512 --> 00:50:47.347
Norman Cleaver.

504
00:50:59.892 --> 00:51:03.097
Woman, 46, missing.

505
00:52:32.452 --> 00:52:33.921
Mister Cleaver?

506
00:52:37.524 --> 00:52:39.861
Mister Cleaver, I
need to talk to you.


507
00:52:41.227 --> 00:52:42.428
I didn't kill her, all right?

508
00:52:42.461 --> 00:52:43.563
I know you didn't.

509
00:52:43.597 --> 00:52:45.566
Go away.

510
00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:47.434
I can't leave without
talking to you.


511
00:52:47.466 --> 00:52:49.602
Get off my property.

512
00:52:49.635 --> 00:52:50.937
You've got it all wrong.

513
00:52:52.506 --> 00:52:55.943
I'm fed up with this,
I'm calling the police.


514
00:52:55.975 --> 00:52:58.012
My name is Casey, Casey...

515
00:52:58.044 --> 00:52:59.412
I have the box.

516
00:53:07.321 --> 00:53:10.625
Mister Cleaver, I am not here
to accuse you of anything.


517
00:53:14.695 --> 00:53:16.062
What did you say?

518
00:53:18.332 --> 00:53:19.600
I have the Jack in the box.

519
00:53:26.173 --> 00:53:27.908
You've seen the
clown, haven't you?


520
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:31.245
Yeah.

521
00:53:34.414 --> 00:53:35.616
Will you help me?

522
00:53:56.669 --> 00:54:00.340
I doubted my own
sanity for many years.


523
00:54:02.709 --> 00:54:05.145
I questioned myself more
than every policeman


524
00:54:05.178 --> 00:54:06.580
and psychiatrist put together.

525
00:54:09.649 --> 00:54:12.353
But as much as they tried
to convince me otherwise,


526
00:54:13.586 --> 00:54:16.389
I always remembered
what took my Belle away.


527
00:54:19.091 --> 00:54:22.062
It was the clown,
killed my wife.


528
00:54:23.562 --> 00:54:24.597
Not me.

529
00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.103
Would you tell me what happened?

530
00:54:39.278 --> 00:54:40.113
Oh, all right.

531
00:54:43.417 --> 00:54:45.586
I used to go metal
detecting in the fields.


532
00:54:47.421 --> 00:54:50.323
I thought I'd struck gold
when I found that thing.


533
00:54:52.559 --> 00:54:54.093
My wife and I believed it was

534
00:54:54.126 --> 00:54:57.430
a simple Jack in the
box, nothing more.


535
00:55:00.434 --> 00:55:02.602
She was fascinated by it.

536
00:55:06.807 --> 00:55:10.778
I went upstairs and
somewhere later,


537
00:55:10.811 --> 00:55:14.115
I realized that she
hadn't followed me.


538
00:55:19.618 --> 00:55:20.787
Then I saw...

539
00:55:25.624 --> 00:55:30.397
...it drag her
corpse to the box.


540
00:55:43.276 --> 00:55:47.614
I told the police my story,
they didn't believe me.


541
00:55:47.646 --> 00:55:48.681
Of course they didn't.

542
00:55:49.582 --> 00:55:52.586
In the eyes of the police,
and the whole town,


543
00:55:52.618 --> 00:55:53.586
I wasn't the victim.

544
00:55:55.122 --> 00:55:57.091
I was the prime
suspect with a story


545
00:55:57.124 --> 00:55:58.725
that just didn't make sense.

546
00:56:02.129 --> 00:56:05.632
My lawyers convinced me that,
in a bid to reduce my sentence,


547
00:56:05.664 --> 00:56:08.334
I should plead guilty
to manslaughter.


548
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:13.674
Plead guilty to killing my wife.

549
00:56:18.311 --> 00:56:19.780
When you're facing
a life sentence,


550
00:56:19.812 --> 00:56:22.749
10 years for manslaughter
seems like the only option.


551
00:56:25.151 --> 00:56:26.686
It almost killed me.

552
00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.557
I believe it's killed others
too, but they won't listen.


553
00:56:30.157 --> 00:56:33.660
No, they won't,
until it's too late.


554
00:56:34.628 --> 00:56:36.696
How do I stop
it from killing again?


555
00:56:38.497 --> 00:56:39.566
I've spent the last 15 years

556
00:56:39.599 --> 00:56:42.436
wondering if there was
something I could have done.


557
00:56:44.604 --> 00:56:45.638
I don't think you can.

558
00:56:48.841 --> 00:56:50.644
I've got to find
a way to end this.


559
00:56:50.676 --> 00:56:52.780
No, you can't end this Casey.

560
00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.383
The damage is already done.

561
00:57:00.519 --> 00:57:03.389
In time, the police will
trace the disappearances


562
00:57:03.423 --> 00:57:05.725
back to you and your little
friends at the museum.


563
00:57:08.861 --> 00:57:09.762
Take it from me.

564
00:57:12.399 --> 00:57:14.201
If the clown doesn't kill you,

565
00:57:15.868 --> 00:57:17.271
the people of
Hawthorne may end up


566
00:57:17.303 --> 00:57:21.274
believing that you
are the monster.


567
00:57:29.883 --> 00:57:31.218
Get out of here.

568
00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:37.257
Get as far away from
Hawthorne as you possibly can.


569
00:57:38.858 --> 00:57:40.394
Save yourself.

570
00:58:15.961 --> 00:58:19.532
You're going to do
it again, aren't you?


571
00:58:21.533 --> 00:58:23.704
You're going to
leave them to die,


572
00:58:26.472 --> 00:58:27.840
just like you left me.

573
00:58:32.012 --> 00:58:33.214
They won't listen.

574
00:58:34.546 --> 00:58:35.782
They don't take me seriously.

575
00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:39.485
Why should I go back there?

576
00:58:41.287 --> 00:58:42.356
I don't owe them anything.

577
00:58:42.388 --> 00:58:44.724
Fine, run.

578
00:58:46.026 --> 00:58:49.730
But how are you going
to live with yourself?


579
00:58:51.965 --> 00:58:53.233
With the guilt.

580
00:58:55.734 --> 00:58:58.872
They don't believe you,
but that doesn't mean


581
00:58:58.905 --> 00:59:00.740
you should give up on them.

582
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:04.811
I've done
everything I can.


583
00:59:04.843 --> 00:59:05.912
Not everything.

584
00:59:07.814 --> 00:59:13.787
If you don't find a way
to stop Jack, who will?


585
01:03:04.716 --> 01:03:08.021
If someone has to
die, let it be me.


586
01:04:07.347 --> 01:04:09.182
Why won't you kill me?

587
01:04:41.914 --> 01:04:43.350
It's come to my attention

588
01:04:43.383 --> 01:04:45.986
that you're having
some problems, Casey.


589
01:04:48.321 --> 01:04:49.590
Nothing I can't handle.

590
01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:52.292
Lisa tells
me that you have


591
01:04:52.325 --> 01:04:55.762
some sort of concern
about this box.


592
01:04:56.928 --> 01:04:59.932
You think it carries
some sort of curse.


593
01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:02.802
I don't expect
you to believe me.


594
01:05:02.834 --> 01:05:04.037
I wonder why.

595
01:05:05.271 --> 01:05:07.907
We have to find a way
to destroy it, Rachel.


596
01:05:07.939 --> 01:05:10.010
Since I opened it, it
has killed four people,


597
01:05:10.042 --> 01:05:11.243
It will kill two more.

598
01:05:11.276 --> 01:05:12.678
- Casey.
- I'm not lying.


599
01:05:12.711 --> 01:05:13.713
Enough.

600
01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:19.686
Look, Mandy's disappearance
has been tough on everyone.


601
01:05:19.718 --> 01:05:22.155
We can't just let our
imaginations run away with us.


602
01:05:22.187 --> 01:05:25.057
You have no idea what
you're dealing with here.


603
01:05:27.325 --> 01:05:28.762
Right, it's over.

604
01:05:29.928 --> 01:05:31.897
I'm terminating your
probation period.


605
01:05:33.231 --> 01:05:34.867
I can't just walk away.

606
01:05:34.901 --> 01:05:36.703
You're done.

607
01:05:36.736 --> 01:05:38.304
I'll never forgive
myself if something...


608
01:05:38.336 --> 01:05:41.206
I'm not giving you the choice.

609
01:05:44.343 --> 01:05:45.712
Go home, Casey.

610
01:05:53.385 --> 01:05:56.221
You didn't have to
be so brutal on him.


611
01:06:09.167 --> 01:06:09.903
Casey!

612
01:06:11.336 --> 01:06:12.237
What?

613
01:06:12.271 --> 01:06:14.240
I didn't mean for
you to lose your job.


614
01:06:15.374 --> 01:06:16.408
I was worried about you.

615
01:06:16.441 --> 01:06:18.343
She had to know about
this, I just didn't think.


616
01:06:18.376 --> 01:06:20.146
No, you didn't.

617
01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.081
Look, just get
away from the box.


618
01:06:23.115 --> 01:06:25.218
Get as far away from
here as you can.


619
01:06:25.251 --> 01:06:26.252
I can't.

620
01:06:26.285 --> 01:06:27.320
Trust me.

621
01:06:28.254 --> 01:06:29.823
Please, tell me you believe me.

622
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:38.965
Take care of yourself.

623
01:06:40.265 --> 01:06:41.401
- Wait.
- I'm sorry.


624
01:06:43.436 --> 01:06:45.104
I'm gonna find a
way to end this.


625
01:07:10.229 --> 01:07:14.300
Hey, have you found
Maurice's house?


626
01:07:14.332 --> 01:07:16.302
<i>His place is
called Hill Farm.</i>


627
01:08:07.086 --> 01:08:07.887
Yes?

628
01:08:07.919 --> 01:08:09.388
Maurice Ainsworth?

629
01:08:09.421 --> 01:08:10.322
Who's asking?

630
01:08:10.356 --> 01:08:12.524
I'm Casey, Casey Reynolds.

631
01:08:12.557 --> 01:08:14.059
I've been trying to reach you.

632
01:08:15.193 --> 01:08:16.862
Did I not return your call?

633
01:08:16.896 --> 01:08:18.064
No, you didn't.

634
01:08:18.597 --> 01:08:20.332
Oh, I didn't think so.

635
01:08:20.365 --> 01:08:22.835
But you thought you could
turn up here unannounced,


636
01:08:22.868 --> 01:08:24.370
and I'd invite you in
for tea in biscuits?


637
01:08:24.403 --> 01:08:27.073
I wouldn't be here if
I had any other choice.


638
01:08:33.613 --> 01:08:36.283
You have half an hour,
not a second more.


639
01:08:40.218 --> 01:08:42.388
I'm all out of biscuits
though, I'm afraid.


640
01:08:44.222 --> 01:08:46.359
So you want to know what
you're dealing with?


641
01:08:46.391 --> 01:08:48.060
Yeah, I opened the...

642
01:08:48.093 --> 01:08:50.896
Yes, yes, I heard
all your messages.


643
01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:52.097
But you haven't
come all this way


644
01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:54.200
just to find out what it is.

645
01:08:54.233 --> 01:08:55.836
You want to know how to kill it.

646
01:08:59.204 --> 01:09:00.472
Jacks are relentless.

647
01:09:01.407 --> 01:09:04.377
But as with all of nature's
creations, they are mortal.


648
01:09:08.446 --> 01:09:10.016
Are you ready for your lunch?

649
01:09:11.016 --> 01:09:11.984
Yeah, sure.

650
01:09:13.084 --> 01:09:13.919
See you later.

651
01:09:15.253 --> 01:09:18.224
Luckily for you, by granting
it access to our world


652
01:09:18.257 --> 01:09:20.894
by opening the box, you
have unwittingly entered


653
01:09:20.927 --> 01:09:22.429
into a deal with the demon.

654
01:09:24.096 --> 01:09:25.565
A deal?

655
01:09:25.597 --> 01:09:27.065
Although it may threaten you,

656
01:09:27.099 --> 01:09:29.401
and do all it can to make
you run away in fear,


657
01:09:30.535 --> 01:09:31.971
it can't kill <i>you.</i>

658
01:09:35.041 --> 01:09:37.243
But I can see in your eyes,

659
01:09:37.275 --> 01:09:40.546
you're not just worried
about yourself, are you?


660
01:10:10.476 --> 01:10:11.978
You brought it into our world,

661
01:10:12.011 --> 01:10:14.414
meaning only you have the
power to send it back.


662
01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:18.284
You have to trap
Jack inside the box.


663
01:10:18.316 --> 01:10:19.151
How?

664
01:10:20.252 --> 01:10:21.922
You must perform a ritual.

665
01:10:37.569 --> 01:10:39.104
Ah! Here it is.

666
01:10:41.172 --> 01:10:44.077
Once a Jack's heart is weakened
by the end of a blade,


667
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:46.012
only the spoken word
will send it back


668
01:10:46.044 --> 01:10:47.480
to the shadows
where it was made.


669
01:10:49.114 --> 01:10:50.282
What do I have to say?

670
01:10:56.388 --> 01:10:57.090
Thank you.

671
01:10:58.356 --> 01:11:01.493
Oh, and Casey, be careful.

672
01:11:01.526 --> 01:11:03.162
You have to get it right.

673
01:11:03.194 --> 01:11:05.564
It would only take
something as small as


674
01:11:05.597 --> 01:11:08.368
a piece of its clothing,
a severed claw.


675
01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:09.635
Anything left outside of the box

676
01:11:09.668 --> 01:11:13.039
while performing the
ritual, and it won't work.


677
01:11:14.606 --> 01:11:16.443
If you leave anything behind,

678
01:11:17.377 --> 01:11:19.611
Jack will come back
for his chosen victims.


679
01:11:22.114 --> 01:11:23.116
Good luck young man.

680
01:11:35.761 --> 01:11:37.464
So what do you
want me to do now?


681
01:11:38.763 --> 01:11:39.599
Rachel?

682
01:11:58.284 --> 01:11:59.652
I'll be off now then, Rachel.

683
01:12:23.275 --> 01:12:24.577
I need police.

684
01:12:24.610 --> 01:12:27.614
I need police at the
Hawthorn museum now.


685
01:12:34.319 --> 01:12:35.154
No!

686
01:13:31.644 --> 01:13:34.646
No!

687
01:13:36.681 --> 01:13:37.649
Come on, open!

688
01:13:47.892 --> 01:13:49.428
Come on, please!

689
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:55.735
No!

690
01:14:50.256 --> 01:14:51.958
Hello?

691
01:14:55.961 --> 01:14:56.796
Lisa.

692
01:15:09.941 --> 01:15:10.776
Lisa?

693
01:18:17.162 --> 01:18:19.064
Back in your box.

694
01:19:29.868 --> 01:19:31.669
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.


695
01:19:35.541 --> 01:19:36.175
It's over.

696
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:39.645
It's over, Lisa.

697
01:19:41.046 --> 01:19:42.748
Police!

698
01:19:46.752 --> 01:19:49.789
She needs an ambulance.

699
01:19:54.892 --> 01:19:56.162
No, no, no, no, no, wait.

700
01:19:58.297 --> 01:19:59.198
I didn't hurt her!

701
01:20:00.599 --> 01:20:01.867
I saved her!

702
01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:02.969
I'm innocent!

703
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:06.705
We
need an ambulance.


704
01:20:06.738 --> 01:20:08.807
Hawthorne Museum, as
soon as possible, please.


705
01:21:11.203 --> 01:21:13.138
Thank you for coming, Lisa.

706
01:21:13.171 --> 01:21:14.173
I didn't think you would.

707
01:21:14.205 --> 01:21:15.975
I need to prove
Casey's innocence.


708
01:21:17.376 --> 01:21:19.878
They won't listen to my stories.

709
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:23.149
They'll never entertain
theories of demons and curses.


710
01:21:24.282 --> 01:21:26.118
I can't see this
ending well for him.


711
01:21:28.285 --> 01:21:30.922
Hawthorne is scared, terrified.

712
01:21:31.890 --> 01:21:34.927
They've lost neighbors,
loved ones, friends.


713
01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:41.132
Someone, flesh and blood,
must be held accountable.


714
01:21:41.166 --> 01:21:42.801
Then why am I here?

715
01:21:42.833 --> 01:21:44.736
Do you know
where the box is?


716
01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:46.171
Yeah.

717
01:21:46.203 --> 01:21:48.373
If you really want
to help Casey,


718
01:21:48.407 --> 01:21:51.243
be the one that finishes
what he started.


719
01:21:51.275 --> 01:21:53.645
Be the one that ends
Jack's curse forever.


720
01:21:53.678 --> 01:21:54.312
How?

721
01:21:56.347 --> 01:21:57.248
There's only one way.

722
01:21:59.016 --> 01:22:01.052
The box cannot be destroyed.

723
01:22:02.319 --> 01:22:04.922
Each life Jack takes
keeps him alive


724
01:22:04.955 --> 01:22:06.225
for another three years.

725
01:22:06.925 --> 01:22:09.093
To truly kill him, you have to...

726
01:22:09.127 --> 01:22:11.030
Stop the box from
being opened again.


727
01:22:12.196 --> 01:22:14.932
As Jack has already
killed five times,


728
01:22:14.966 --> 01:22:18.169
the box remain
unopened for 15 years.


729
01:22:20.271 --> 01:22:22.941
You must ensure no
one else finds it.


730
01:22:36.421 --> 01:22:38.958
You're gonna be honest
with me this time, Casey.


731
01:22:44.261 --> 01:22:46.330
I've told you what happened.

732
01:22:46.364 --> 01:22:48.067
I've told you everything.

733
01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:49.301
I'm still not buying it.

734
01:22:49.333 --> 01:22:50.334
It's the truth.

735
01:22:50.368 --> 01:22:53.272
You wanna know what I think?

736
01:22:53.305 --> 01:22:54.907
I think you'll plead insanity.

737
01:23:01.846 --> 01:23:03.247
Ten years in the nut
house doesn't seem


738
01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:05.383
that bad right now, does it?

739
01:23:07.452 --> 01:23:08.986
Why don't you make
yourself comfortable,


740
01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:11.223
'cause you're gonna be
here a long, long time.


741
01:23:29.274 --> 01:23:31.410
I'll ask you again.

742
01:23:31.443 --> 01:23:33.378
Did you kill your boss, Rachel?

743
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:34.245
No.

744
01:23:38.416 --> 01:23:41.287
Maybe this will
refresh your memory.


745
01:23:44.955 --> 01:23:47.459
Now, you took a young
woman's life away that day.


746
01:23:49.427 --> 01:23:52.264
Rachel wasn't the only
easy target, was she?


747
01:23:52.297 --> 01:23:53.098
No.

748
01:23:54.466 --> 01:23:56.334
You went after Lisa
too, didn't you?


749
01:23:57.269 --> 01:23:59.338
And you thought you'd get
away with it...


750
01:24:02.039 --> 01:24:02.774
...didn't you?

751
01:24:06.144 --> 01:24:06.979
Didn't you?

752
01:24:08.814 --> 01:24:11.450
Be careful,
you have to get it right.


753
01:24:12.284 --> 01:24:14.219
It would only take
something as small


754
01:24:14.252 --> 01:24:16.422
as a piece of it's
clothing, a severed claw.


755
01:24:17.422 --> 01:24:19.024
Anything left outside of the box

756
01:24:19.056 --> 01:24:21.526
while performing the
ritual, and it won't work.


757
01:24:23.328 --> 01:24:25.364
If you leave anything behind,

758
01:24:25.396 --> 01:24:27.533
Jack will come back
for his chosen victims.


759
01:24:29.568 --> 01:24:32.404
Oh my god, Lisa!

760
01:24:33.337 --> 01:24:34.840
It's gonna come back for her!

761
01:24:36.341 --> 01:24:37.376
Did you kill Rachel?

762
01:24:37.409 --> 01:24:38.811
You have to listen to me.

763
01:24:38.843 --> 01:24:40.479
Answer the question!

764
01:24:41.846 --> 01:24:44.048
You have to believe
me, it didn't work!


765
01:24:44.082 --> 01:24:44.983
Take him away.

766
01:24:45.016 --> 01:24:46.552
We have to help her!

767
01:24:46.584 --> 01:24:48.220
We have to help her!

768
01:24:55.092 --> 01:24:56.095
We have to help her!

769
01:24:58.864 --> 01:25:00.933
You've got to believe me!

770
01:25:26.439 --> 01:25:31.439
