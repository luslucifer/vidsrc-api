1
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.547
- The following
program is brought to you


2
00:00:04.571 --> 00:00:06.705
in living color on NBC.

3
00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.510
Let's tell a joke and start
the whole world laughin'


4
00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.747
Let's do a schtick and
set 'em on their ears


5
00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:19.184
Let's cross our eyes and
make a face and do a routine


6
00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:22.420
Something bizarre
See what I mean


7
00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.590
Tell the one about
the traveling salesman


8
00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:28.860
It's always worked,
since Hector was a pup


9
00:00:28.895 --> 00:00:32.230
We're only after
a little laughter


10
00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:37.902
So everybody
laugh it up (laughing)


11
00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.740
- Dick, who was that lady
I saw you with last night?


12
00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:45.910
- That was no lady. That
was Myra Breckenridge.


13
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:49.158
- Say, fellas, my brother

14
00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:51.127
spent the last two
years at Berkeley.


15
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.862
- I didn't know he
was a college student.


16
00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.420
- He's not. He's an
Oakland policeman.


17
00:00:58.458 --> 00:01:00.292
- Hey, Henry, does Lester Maddox

18
00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:01.859
serve buffalo in his restaurant?

19
00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:06.431
- No, Chelsea, you'll both
have to go around back.


20
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.946
- Miss Goldie Hawn,
how in the world


21
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.670
are we ever gonna make
ends meet in this country?


22
00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:17.041
- Well, David, get a
contortionist in the White House.


23
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.113
- Judy, Judy, Judy.

24
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.547
- What is it, Jo Anne?

25
00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:24.861
- Tell me this.
- What?


26
00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:28.019
- What has four
wheels and flies?


27
00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:30.721
- Timothy Leary's rollaway bed.

28
00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:36.072
- Was it very crowded at
the White House reception


29
00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.328
last night, Allan?

30
00:01:37.364 --> 00:01:39.163
- Not under my table.

31
00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:44.814
- Hey, Chelsea, you
don't seem to think much


32
00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:45.370
of George Wallace.

33
00:01:45.405 --> 00:01:46.270
How come?

34
00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:47.605
- Well, Goldie, I'll tell ya,

35
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:51.075
the way I see it is if he had
his conscience taken out


36
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.411
it'd be a minor operation.

37
00:01:56.949 --> 00:02:00.452
- Dan, what does a
senator take home in a year?


38
00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:03.021
- Oh, Judy, any given amount.

39
00:02:05.992 --> 00:02:08.959
- Rowan and Martin, Rowan
and Martin, Rowan and Martin.


40
00:02:08.995 --> 00:02:10.428
- Yes, yes, yes.

41
00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:14.666
- I think Curtis LeMay would've
made a great vice president


42
00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.100
except for one thing.

43
00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.213
- What's that big Jo?

44
00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:18.237
- His head.

45
00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:23.007
- I didn't even know
he earned a boat.


46
00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:28.391
- Your brother
was trying so hard


47
00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:29.881
to get a government position.

48
00:02:29.917 --> 00:02:30.957
What's he doing now?

49
00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:31.616
- Nothing.

50
00:02:31.652 --> 00:02:33.652
- Oh! He got the job.

51
00:02:37.658 --> 00:02:38.835
- You know something, camera?

52
00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.293
If Raquel Welch
married Cassius Clay,


53
00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:46.831
well that would be like bringing
the mountains to Mohammed.


54
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.513
- You know, Connie,
the war in Viet Nam


55
00:02:50.537 --> 00:02:53.672
is costing us 24
billion dollars a year.


56
00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:55.585
- Oh, shoot, Henry,
with all that money,


57
00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.544
why don't we find a
nicer place to fight in?


58
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.516
- Guiseppe Guadalupe,

59
00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:07.051
I hear that your
brother lifts dumbbells.


60
00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.921
- Well, Edith May
Sophie, that's right.


61
00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:14.592
He runs an elevator for
the State Department.


62
00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:17.429
So tell a joke and start
the whole world laughin'


63
00:03:17.464 --> 00:03:20.531
'Cause now and then
we'll always fill a cot


64
00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:23.434
It's fast and zippy,
you bet your bippy


65
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.437
So everybody laugh it up, ha ha

66
00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:31.942
Everybody laugh it up (applause)

67
00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:35.113
- And now, from the repair shop

68
00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:39.250
of the beautiful downtown
Burbank maternity ward,


69
00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:42.420
NBC asks the musical question,

70
00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:44.923
Laugh In, starring Dan Rowan

71
00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.491
and Dick Martin,

72
00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:50.595
with guest star Connie Stephens,

73
00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:52.097
and Judy Carnes,

74
00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:56.868
Arte Johnson, with Ruth Buzzy,

75
00:03:58.004 --> 00:03:59.070
Henry Gibson,

76
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.108
Goldie Hawn, Dave
Madden, Alan Sues,


77
00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:08.580
Chelsea Brown,
and Jo Anne Worley,


78
00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:12.283
yours truly, Gary Owens,

79
00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:15.119
and Morgul as
the friendly drelb.


80
00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.564
- But first, folk,
here's a commercial


81
00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:23.961
to bring our show
off to a flying stop.


82
00:04:25.865 --> 00:04:27.810
- And that's our
show for tonight, folk.


83
00:04:27.834 --> 00:04:30.668
Here with a final word are
the irrepressible Dan Rowan


84
00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:33.271
and the pressable Dick Martin.

85
00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:35.707
(applause)

86
00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:45.349
- Well, you've done it again.
Five hours late for rehearsal.


87
00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:48.086
- It's not my fault if I got
one of the lady cab drivers


88
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:50.722
in Los Angeles who
doesn't know her way around.


89
00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:52.890
- Where'd you find
a lady cab driver?


90
00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:56.360
- She was parked in the
lobby of my apartment.


91
00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:57.506
- That makes sense, I guess.

92
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.562
- Backed right in.

93
00:04:58.598 --> 00:04:59.808
- You grabbed her in the lobby.

94
00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:01.699
- I beg your pardon?

95
00:05:02.802 --> 00:05:05.013
- It took you five hours
to get from your apartment


96
00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:05.870
to the studio?

97
00:05:05.905 --> 00:05:07.850
- No, that took
about 20 minutes.


98
00:05:07.874 --> 00:05:10.019
- Well now don't tell
me you ran out of gas.


99
00:05:10.043 --> 00:05:11.421
- Well, I held up
my end pretty good


100
00:05:11.445 --> 00:05:13.845
but she got a little tired.

101
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:16.592
- Well, I hope you're
pleased with yourself.


102
00:05:16.616 --> 00:05:19.350
You kept 50 people
waiting here for rehearsal.


103
00:05:19.385 --> 00:05:21.664
The first thing you do is
hop in the back of a cab.


104
00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:24.188
- No, first thing I did
was turn off the meter.


105
00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:25.234
- You turned off the meter.

106
00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:29.594
- Yeah, the ticking
throws me timing off.


107
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.996
- At least you could've
made a phone call.


108
00:05:32.032 --> 00:05:33.776
- I would've but I
didn't have any money.


109
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.611
- You didn't have any money?
How'd you pay for the cab?


110
00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:38.836
- That's what I've
been trying to tell ya.


111
00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:42.006
- Oh, don't you
just love that Dick


112
00:05:43.276 --> 00:05:44.609
. Oh.

113
00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.711
- It's not true that
actors are vain.


114
00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:48.090
They're just like
everybody else.


115
00:05:48.114 --> 00:05:50.682
I get up every morning,
kiss my mirror goodbye,


116
00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:52.717
and go off to work.

117
00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:55.119
- If it feels good, do it.

118
00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:57.488
- You need a program to
tell the fruit from the nuts,


119
00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:58.823
you know.

120
00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.092
- How does that grab
you, bippy lovers?


121
00:06:01.127 --> 00:06:03.661
- You know, this show
is a little confusing


122
00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:05.897
but I think I finally
have it classified.


123
00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:09.634
What it is, is a sorta
lunatic fringe version


124
00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.002
of Sermonette.

125
00:06:15.175 --> 00:06:18.142
- Ever notice that girls
who fool around taste salty?


126
00:06:18.178 --> 00:06:21.846
- They wouldn't say that
on the Good Ship Lollipop.


127
00:06:21.881 --> 00:06:24.615
- He doesn't know. He's
never been out with one.


128
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.785
- Well, ring my chimes.

129
00:06:27.721 --> 00:06:28.731
- How 'bout a few quickies?

130
00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:29.687
- Oh, I'll drink to that.

131
00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:31.155
- I thought you would.

132
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:34.291
- Anybody knows, you want a
few laughs, have a few quickies.


133
00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:36.506
- Yes, friends, there's a
new department for Laugh In,


134
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.130
so join us for a few quickies.

135
00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:43.968
- Uh, the truck
drivin' hint number 16.


136
00:06:44.003 --> 00:06:45.881
If you're driving a
large dynamite truck


137
00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.706
up an extremely icy, steep hill,

138
00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:50.975
and your motor dies
and your brakes fail,


139
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.177
and you start rollin'
backwards downhill,


140
00:06:53.213 --> 00:06:56.881
immediately adjust
your rearview mirror.


141
00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:00.062
- Judy Fairy?
- Yes?


142
00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.898
- Can I borrow a
cup of stardust?


143
00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:05.189
Hoagie Carmichael's
coming to dinner.


144
00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:08.704
- Little John? Little John?

145
00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:11.395
- Over there, behind the trees.

146
00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:17.168
- Gentlemen, Wacker,
I'm proud to announce


147
00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:20.571
that we have finally solved
the auto safety problem.


148
00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:24.342
This morning, six
of our top engineers


149
00:07:24.377 --> 00:07:26.244
kidnapped Ralph Nader.

150
00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:40.658
- This is your offstage
announcer reminding you,


151
00:07:40.693 --> 00:07:42.360
my hair is on fire.

152
00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:46.798
- It's outrageous, Jo Anne.

153
00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.177
The police stopped
me the other night.


154
00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:49.978
Something about a
warrant for a parking ticket


155
00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:50.835
from two years ago.

156
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.102
- You're kidding.

157
00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.417
- No, they took me to the
station house, booked me,


158
00:07:54.441 --> 00:07:57.141
fingerprinted me, kept
me in jail overnight,


159
00:07:57.176 --> 00:07:59.644
all for a lousy
two-dollar parking ticket.


160
00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:00.923
- Well, that's terrible, Connie.

161
00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:02.792
I mean, it does
seem a bit harsh.


162
00:08:02.816 --> 00:08:04.993
Well, what did they stop
you for in the first place?


163
00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:07.384
- Oh, I ran over a fireman.

164
00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:12.189
- So there ya have it,
tonight's Laugh In quickies.


165
00:08:12.224 --> 00:08:14.826
- We'll be having a few
quickies from time to time


166
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:16.260
so remember our slogan.

167
00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:17.462
- That's your slogan.

168
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.364
- Yeah, if you want a few
laughs, have a few quickies.


169
00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:24.535
- Speaking of The Flying
Fickle Finger of Fate.


170
00:08:26.473 --> 00:08:28.484
Well, as you can see
by the little old finger


171
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:30.875
gleaming in the spotlight,
once again it's time


172
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.243
for the Flying Fickle
Finger of Fate award.


173
00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:35.847
- Who gets the little
darling digit this time?


174
00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.593
- The auditor of the
city of Dallas, Texas.


175
00:08:37.617 --> 00:08:40.050
- Ah ha, heavens forbid.
What's he done to deserve it?


176
00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:43.454
- Well recently a city policeman
picked up his paycheck.


177
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.891
Unfortunately, he was killed
that night in the line of duty.


178
00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:49.326
Now the city auditor has
asked the patrolman's widow


179
00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:53.163
to return 27 dollars and

180
00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.666
claiming it was based
on the amount of overtime


181
00:08:55.702 --> 00:08:58.035
they thought the
policeman would put in.


182
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.638
And they couldn't have

183
00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:02.507
on the books to a dead man.

184
00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:05.610
- Well, I don't have

185
00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:07.389
a little something here
for the Dallas city auditor.


186
00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:08.713
- Mm-hm.

187
00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:11.415
- Here you are, city auditor.
You certainly earned it.


188
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.918
And by the way, you can
hold onto that overtime.


189
00:09:13.953 --> 00:09:15.887
No extra charge.

190
00:09:15.922 --> 00:09:18.089
- And be sure and
tune in next week, folk,


191
00:09:18.124 --> 00:09:20.164
when the Flying
Fickle Finger of Fate,


192
00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:24.228
or the Precious Pinky, as
the guys in the wardrobe call it,


193
00:09:24.264 --> 00:09:28.866
will go to ABC for not announcing
its annual second season


194
00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:32.770
until most of its third
season had been cancelled.


195
00:09:32.805 --> 00:09:34.672
- Later that same evening...

196
00:09:34.707 --> 00:09:39.643
- Say, Judy, what's all this
sock it to me business about?


197
00:09:39.678 --> 00:09:41.312
- Well, Connie, it's strange.

198
00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:46.450
But it usually starts
when I say, sock it to me.


199
00:09:46.486 --> 00:09:51.822
Sometimes they sock it
to me for no reason at all.


200
00:09:51.857 --> 00:09:53.991
- Sometimes you
can sit in the grass


201
00:09:54.027 --> 00:09:58.329
and you just don't believe
the splash you can get.


202
00:09:58.364 --> 00:10:01.698
But don't worry. It don't
happen to nobody but Judy.


203
00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:05.436
- I think,
psychologically speaking,


204
00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:10.007
it's just a form of release
for our childish producers.


205
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:14.278
C
-F
-G! (laughing)

206
00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:15.346
- You know what?

207
00:10:15.381 --> 00:10:18.382
They think I don't know
when it's gonna happen.


208
00:10:18.418 --> 00:10:20.029
They think I don't
know when it's gonna,


209
00:10:20.053 --> 00:10:22.819
and I'm gonna get it
socked to me, but I do.


210
00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:25.022
I know how to bear
the brunt of it all.


211
00:10:25.058 --> 00:10:27.758
I sit a little back in my chair,

212
00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:31.495
and I lean to
the side like this.


213
00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:34.298
(women exclaim)

214
00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:38.602
- If you ask me, I
think it's all a little silly.


215
00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.018
- Another cute trick
that they tell us is


216
00:10:43.042 --> 00:10:45.909
there's not gonna be
any sock it to me tonight


217
00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:48.479
but you watch, there will be.

218
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.083
- Oh my goodness.

219
00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:54.351
So true.

220
00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:57.421
- I'm not worried at all
because they would never


221
00:10:57.457 --> 00:11:01.392
have the nerve to
sock it to the guest star.


222
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.408
You know we
better go inside, girls.


223
00:11:06.432 --> 00:11:10.968
If we stay out any longer
we're gonna get sun stroke.


224
00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:20.678
(laughs)

225
00:11:22.915 --> 00:11:25.649
(clears throat)

226
00:11:35.228 --> 00:11:37.228
- Ah, la, lu, lu, lu.

227
00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:41.565
Do you love me?

228
00:11:41.601 --> 00:11:42.601
- Oh!

229
00:11:46.072 --> 00:11:47.571
- Do you like me?

230
00:11:50.176 --> 00:11:53.511
You sure know how
to sweet talk a man.


231
00:11:57.584 --> 00:12:00.184
(silly music)

232
00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:15.866
- I thought you'd never get
here you gorgeous thing.


233
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:18.669
Did you bring the
detergent? Huh?


234
00:12:18.704 --> 00:12:20.571
Come on. Come in here.

235
00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:24.642
- Oh, honey, I got great news.

236
00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:27.745
Your lawyer says he'll
have you out in three weeks.


237
00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:29.258
- Three weeks?
- Yeah.


238
00:12:29.282 --> 00:12:30.581
- I can't leave in three weeks.

239
00:12:30.616 --> 00:12:31.949
- Why?

240
00:12:31.984 --> 00:12:35.586
- It'll take me at least a
month to finish my tapestry.


241
00:12:35.622 --> 00:12:38.489
- Are you going to wait up
for the missus tonight, sir?


242
00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:41.158
- Oh, I don't think so,
my dear. I think I'll retire.


243
00:12:41.193 --> 00:12:43.427
- Oh, then would you
like me to tuck you in?


244
00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:46.063
- Well, that's very
nice of you, my dear.


245
00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:48.532
- You miss her
terribly, don't you?


246
00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:52.569
- Yes. These last 17
years haven't been easy.


247
00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:56.773
(musical flourish)

248
00:12:56.809 --> 00:12:57.809
- C
-F
-G.

249
00:13:01.314 --> 00:13:05.816
I'm getting married
in the morning


250
00:13:05.851 --> 00:13:09.586
(vocalizes operatically)

251
00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:12.223
(silly music)

252
00:13:35.914 --> 00:13:37.448
- No question about it, honey,

253
00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.182
you should be home by Christmas.

254
00:13:39.218 --> 00:13:42.052
- Christmas? No, no, I
can't leave before Christmas.


255
00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:43.254
- Why?

256
00:13:43.289 --> 00:13:47.157
- I'm one of the angels
in the prison play.


257
00:13:48.294 --> 00:13:51.295
- It's getting late, sir.
You really should retire.


258
00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:53.331
- Yes, I am exhausted.

259
00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:56.300
I must've walked in my
sleep again last night.


260
00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:58.135
- You were asleep?

261
00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:01.071
- Mr. Brooks?
- Yes?


262
00:14:01.107 --> 00:14:03.574
- Are you really the two
thousand year old man?


263
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.441
- No.

264
00:14:04.477 --> 00:14:05.477
- Oh, bye.

265
00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.857
- And now, to the
University of California


266
00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:13.417
in exotic Berkeley, let's
return to Leave it to Cleaver.


267
00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:17.421
- And now it's time for
the Laugh In news report.


268
00:14:17.457 --> 00:14:20.324
For those of you watching
for the first time tonight,


269
00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:22.070
I really don't know
quite how to describe


270
00:14:22.094 --> 00:14:24.362
the Laugh In news report to you.

271
00:14:24.397 --> 00:14:28.065
I guess you might say
it's, well, it's sort of like


272
00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.335
a second honeymoon
for a couple in their 80s.


273
00:14:31.371 --> 00:14:33.148
It's a lot more fun
to think about it


274
00:14:33.172 --> 00:14:36.240
than it is to actually watch it.

275
00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:40.410
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Laugh In news report.


276
00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:50.087
What's the news
across the nation


277
00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:53.524
We have got the information

278
00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:57.895
In a way we hope will amuse you

279
00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:04.868
We just want to
give you our views


280
00:15:05.938 --> 00:15:07.571
La, la, di, da

281
00:15:07.606 --> 00:15:11.942
Ladies and gents, Laugh
In's look at the news


282
00:15:19.152 --> 00:15:21.185
- [All] Here's Dan.

283
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.521
(applause)

284
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:25.700
- Ah, with the
news of the present,


285
00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:27.169
here's the man to whom the
news wouldn't be the news


286
00:15:27.193 --> 00:15:28.092
without the news.

287
00:15:28.127 --> 00:15:29.460
Here's Dickie.

288
00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:31.428
(applause)

289
00:15:31.464 --> 00:15:35.799
(distorted theme from
"The Tonight Show")


290
00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:43.073
- I think I just saw
five Minnie Pearls.


291
00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:44.441
Green Bay Wisconsin.

292
00:15:44.477 --> 00:15:46.910
The sporting world
was shocked today


293
00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:48.278
when the United Fruit Company

294
00:15:48.313 --> 00:15:50.347
purchased the Green Bay Packers,

295
00:15:50.383 --> 00:15:54.451
which will now be called
the Green Bay Fruits.


296
00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:58.889
Hollywood, busty
screen star Raquel Welch


297
00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:01.859
has agreed to go
topless for the part of Jane


298
00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:04.395
in the movie, Tarzan Goes Ape.

299
00:16:05.398 --> 00:16:07.409
There'll be a lot of
swinging in that one.


300
00:16:07.433 --> 00:16:08.799
Beverly Hills, California.

301
00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:11.769
Steve McQueen's wife was
released from the hospital today


302
00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:14.505
after a mysterious
transplant operation.


303
00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:17.340
Steve would make no
comment except to say,


304
00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:21.111
now it's a lot more
fun to dance with her.


305
00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:22.946
Take it away, Goldie.

306
00:16:25.518 --> 00:16:27.918
- And now, with the
news of the future,


307
00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:30.021
here's our own Dan Rowan.

308
00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.691
- Well, Goldie, that
was just perfect.


309
00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:35.792
- Well, thank you.

310
00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:40.531
I'm so happy because my
mother's watching tonight.


311
00:16:40.566 --> 00:16:43.067
- Oh, well I'm certain
she's gonna be proud


312
00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.735
of what she just saw.

313
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.905
- How would she know?
She's watching Lucy.


314
00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:48.940
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:49.808 --> 00:16:51.475
I was just kidding.

316
00:16:52.545 --> 00:16:54.478
- Can't watch 'em all.

317
00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:57.548
- News of the future,

318
00:16:57.583 --> 00:17:00.217
Peace finally came to
the Middle East today,


319
00:17:00.253 --> 00:17:02.653
when the Arab nations
merged with Israel.


320
00:17:02.688 --> 00:17:06.090
The new nation will
be known as Israel.


321
00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:10.661
Washington, D.C., 1989.

322
00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:13.764
The government approved
use of the new youth pill,


323
00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:16.600
which takes 20 years
off a person's life.


324
00:17:16.635 --> 00:17:20.371
Mr. and Mrs. George Jessel
were the first to take the pill.


325
00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.639
Mr. Jessel took

326
00:17:22.675 --> 00:17:24.875
and became 70 years old again.

327
00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:28.946
The new Mrs. Jessel also
took 20 years off her life,


328
00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.448
and disappeared.

329
00:17:32.452 --> 00:17:35.786
Finally, this item
from the moon, 1989.


330
00:17:35.821 --> 00:17:38.622
The world's first commercial
interspace passenger plane


331
00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:40.391
arrived on the moon today.

332
00:17:40.426 --> 00:17:43.527
Actress Sophia Loren was
slightly injured on arrival.


333
00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:45.596
Stepping from the
pressurized plane


334
00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.509
to the weightless
surface of the moon,


335
00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:51.902
Miss Loren jumped for
joy and knocked herself out.


336
00:17:51.937 --> 00:17:55.573
Actress Mia Farrow,
who also jumped for joy,


337
00:17:55.608 --> 00:17:58.476
didn't do herself
a darn bit of harm.


338
00:17:58.511 --> 00:18:00.711
Now, here's Miss Rona Blast.

339
00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:05.082
- Hi, Rona Blast here with
another Hollywood flash.


340
00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.520
- Television writers today
complain that their work


341
00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:14.091
is continuously being
censored and watered down.


342
00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:17.594
Laugh In news now takes
you back to Stratford on Avon,


343
00:18:17.629 --> 00:18:21.631
to the days when the
writer's words were law.


344
00:18:22.835 --> 00:18:26.436
- Mr. Shakespeare,
congratulations.


345
00:18:26.471 --> 00:18:29.472
This Hamlet thing you dreamed up

346
00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:32.009
could make one heck of a play.

347
00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:33.088
- Thank you, thank you.

348
00:18:33.112 --> 00:18:35.212
- No, no, no really.

349
00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:37.548
We love where the
mother and the uncle


350
00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:40.417
get together and
murder the father.


351
00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:43.553
- Yes, and then when
the kid kills several friends


352
00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:45.789
and two total strangers.

353
00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:48.759
Now that's what
I call a grabber.


354
00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.294
- Yes, yes, but well, you see...

355
00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:52.863
- But what really knocked us out

356
00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:56.967
was where he and
the broad both go batty.


357
00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:59.737
She does herself in,
and the kid knocks off


358
00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:01.838
his old lady and the uncle.

359
00:19:01.873 --> 00:19:04.942
Action, boy,
that's where it's at.


360
00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:08.990
- But that's not
what I intended.


361
00:19:09.014 --> 00:19:10.514
- Right, kid, right.

362
00:19:11.416 --> 00:19:13.750
You'll hardly have
to change a line.


363
00:19:13.786 --> 00:19:17.554
All you have to
do is cut out this


364
00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:19.723
to be or not to be garbage,

365
00:19:20.793 --> 00:19:25.162
and, um, add a little
sex, a little violence.


366
00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.931
And, of course,
change the title.


367
00:19:27.967 --> 00:19:30.067
- Change the title?

368
00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:31.368
- Right.

369
00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:33.470
Now, instead of Hamlet,

370
00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:37.875
how does the name
Peyton Place grab you?


371
00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:42.646
(silly vocalizations)

372
00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:45.882
- And now, with the
Laugh In sports news,


373
00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:50.954
here's that old volleyballer,
himself, Alan Sues.


374
00:19:50.989 --> 00:19:52.423
Maybe just a sip.

375
00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:54.225
- Hi, Big Al here.

376
00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.359
(rings bell)

377
00:19:55.394 --> 00:19:56.493
Featurette.

378
00:19:57.363 --> 00:19:59.930
Just back from Lake
Placid, New York


379
00:19:59.965 --> 00:20:02.666
for the third annual
curling competition,


380
00:20:02.702 --> 00:20:04.768
and I am just furious.

381
00:20:04.803 --> 00:20:08.572
To think that I traveled 600
miles in freezing weather


382
00:20:08.608 --> 00:20:10.841
and all I saw was a
bunch of old codgers


383
00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.176
sliding things
around on the ice.


384
00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:14.478
Some curling!

385
00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:18.349
I was expecting at least
a free wash and set.


386
00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:19.850
Boom, boom, bad.

387
00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:23.587
Ta, ta.

388
00:20:23.623 --> 00:20:24.766
- Well, that's our
news for tonight.


389
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.956
What did you think of it?

390
00:20:25.992 --> 00:20:27.569
- Well, I thought
Chet was terrific,


391
00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:28.770
but as far as I'm concerned,

392
00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:31.394
David might as well not
even have been here.


393
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.696
- Go to your ward.

394
00:20:32.732 --> 00:20:34.931
- Baxter?
- I don't care.


395
00:20:38.303 --> 00:20:41.137
- The Bull Moose,
by Henry Gibson.


396
00:20:42.508 --> 00:20:47.911
Mm The bull moose
is my pal, true blue


397
00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:51.448
He don't smoke or drink or chew

398
00:20:51.484 --> 00:20:54.885
His only hang up
is he sniffs glue


399
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.256
If I was a bull
moose, I would, too


400
00:21:00.593 --> 00:21:03.193
(silly music)

401
00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:09.566
(vocalizes operatically)

402
00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:10.801
- Attention!

403
00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:14.571
Cigarette?

404
00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:17.340
- No thanks, I'm trying to quit.

405
00:21:18.811 --> 00:21:21.612
- Hey, your number's 385-4677?

406
00:21:23.349 --> 00:21:24.915
- What else?

407
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.584
- What was it before
you changed it?


408
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:30.220
(piano music)

409
00:21:31.357 --> 00:21:34.691
- It's getting late, sir.
Time for you to retire.


410
00:21:34.727 --> 00:21:36.326
- Yes, gosh it is.

411
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.762
Tell me, my dear,

412
00:21:38.798 --> 00:21:41.665
how long have you been
the downstairs maid?


413
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.700
- Oh, just over a year now.

414
00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:46.770
- Hm. I think I
shall promote you.


415
00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:50.073
How would you like to
be the upstairs maid?


416
00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:53.343
- Oh, yes, I'd like
that very much, sir.


417
00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:54.878
When do I start?

418
00:21:54.914 --> 00:21:57.848
- Right now, my dear, right now.

419
00:21:59.684 --> 00:22:01.451
(musical flourish)

420
00:22:01.486 --> 00:22:03.754
- Join the Walmetto protest,

421
00:22:03.789 --> 00:22:06.123
Box 599, Willoughby, Ohio.

422
00:22:14.733 --> 00:22:16.466
Powerhouse.

423
00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:17.946
- And now, here's
Goldie with our


424
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:20.603
Mistake of the Week department.

425
00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:23.140
- Um, uh, we don't have

426
00:22:23.175 --> 00:22:25.508
a Mistake of the Week
department tonight.


427
00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:28.212
I had one, but I musta lost it.

428
00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:32.216
- Goldie? You're adorable.

429
00:22:32.251 --> 00:22:35.986
I'd love to canoodle
you, but you're dumb.


430
00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.021
Dumb, stupid.

431
00:22:37.957 --> 00:22:42.091
- That's the most
beautiful thing I ever heard.


432
00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:44.906
- The management
of the Nern Hotel


433
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.063
in beautiful downtown Burbank

434
00:22:47.099 --> 00:22:49.766
announced they are
changing the wallpaper


435
00:22:49.802 --> 00:22:52.235
in the presidential suite,
from the New York Times


436
00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.704
to the Chicago Tribune.

437
00:22:54.739 --> 00:22:58.242
- You ain't heard
nothin' yet, folk.


438
00:22:58.277 --> 00:23:00.944
(groovy music)

439
00:23:09.455 --> 00:23:11.855
- Last night I
dreamed I was equal,


440
00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.890
in my Maidenform bra.

441
00:23:18.164 --> 00:23:19.774
- I see where the
Russians are upset


442
00:23:19.798 --> 00:23:22.232
about the Americans
in the Bosperus.


443
00:23:22.268 --> 00:23:24.146
- Well, they might
as well get used to it.


444
00:23:24.170 --> 00:23:27.438
We Americans have
always been more bosperus


445
00:23:27.473 --> 00:23:29.073
than the Russians.

446
00:23:33.279 --> 00:23:36.579
- Boris and I went to
a movie for adults only.


447
00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:38.282
And it was so stimulating.

448
00:23:38.317 --> 00:23:42.452
We just came out feeling
like a couple of kids.


449
00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:48.826
- Gee, that was too
bad about Mayor Yorty.


450
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:50.360
I hear he fell off the roof.

451
00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:54.932
Fortunately, he wasn't
hurt. The smog broke his fall.


452
00:23:58.771 --> 00:24:01.672
- At my college we learn
all about sex education.


453
00:24:01.707 --> 00:24:03.618
Why, one day last week
they even mentioned it


454
00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:05.175
in the classroom.

455
00:24:09.448 --> 00:24:12.048
- As far as I'm concerned,
the biggest problem


456
00:24:12.083 --> 00:24:16.420
with interracial marriages
is interracial divorce.


457
00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:24.060
- I just saw the movie,
Girl On the Bicycle,


458
00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:27.363
and she had a
better seat than I did.


459
00:24:31.904 --> 00:24:33.537
- Dick?
- Yeah?


460
00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:34.805
- I'm French.

461
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.873
- No kidding.

462
00:24:35.908 --> 00:24:39.442
- How would you
handle our problems?


463
00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:40.343
- Well, let's see.

464
00:24:40.379 --> 00:24:42.679
First, I'd lower your tariffs,

465
00:24:42.715 --> 00:24:46.049
so we could evaluate
your commodities.


466
00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:52.755
- In America, you
call three days in bed


467
00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:57.794
with aching bones and
high fever the Hong Kong flu.


468
00:24:57.829 --> 00:25:01.231
In my country, they
call it a vacation.


469
00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:08.404
- Miss Ornsby, what
do you think of that girl


470
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.475
who posed nude on the
record cover with John Lennon?


471
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.810
- Yoko Ono?

472
00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:16.579
- No thanks, I just put one out.

473
00:25:20.719 --> 00:25:22.397
- Oh, I hear there's
a rumor in Rome


474
00:25:22.421 --> 00:25:25.222
that Ralph Nader's
next target is the church.


475
00:25:25.257 --> 00:25:28.959
He figures they need
more safety devices.


476
00:25:32.231 --> 00:25:34.075
- Do you know
that in the ghettos,


477
00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:36.299
the mailmen are walking in twos?

478
00:25:36.335 --> 00:25:40.871
- On Fire Island, they've
been doing that for years.


479
00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:45.086
- Hey, I hear NBC
just bought the rights


480
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:49.846
to the next Arab-Israeli
war as a half-hour special.


481
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:52.549
(groovy music)

482
00:26:05.431 --> 00:26:08.431
- Return with us now to those
thrilling days of yesteryear


483
00:26:08.466 --> 00:26:12.636
with the Lone Ranger and
his faithful Indian companion,


484
00:26:12.671 --> 00:26:13.770
Nehru.

485
00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:14.849
- Hey, I've been
meaning to ask ya,


486
00:26:14.873 --> 00:26:16.417
how are your art
lessons coming along?


487
00:26:16.441 --> 00:26:19.041
- Well, I started my
first painting this week.


488
00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:20.255
- You've been taking
lessons for six weeks.


489
00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:21.856
You haven't
finished anything yet?


490
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:23.858
- Well, I'm still learning
how to hold the brush.


491
00:26:23.882 --> 00:26:26.483
- Oh. Well, I guess
technique is important.


492
00:26:26.518 --> 00:26:30.086
- Sure is. Every time a
model walks in, I go to pieces.


493
00:26:30.121 --> 00:26:31.699
- I thought most
beginners started out


494
00:26:31.723 --> 00:26:33.056
with apples and oranges.

495
00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:35.425
- Not me. I started with legs.

496
00:26:35.461 --> 00:26:37.927
- Well, I'm glad to see
you're taking an interest


497
00:26:37.963 --> 00:26:39.474
in some of the
finer things in life.


498
00:26:39.498 --> 00:26:40.930
- Oh, I am.

499
00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:44.034
You know, last week I got so
involved, I stayed after class.


500
00:26:44.069 --> 00:26:44.934
- Oh, good for you.

501
00:26:44.969 --> 00:26:46.369
- For three days.

502
00:26:46.405 --> 00:26:48.383
- Are you sure you're
not taking these lessons


503
00:26:48.407 --> 00:26:50.151
just to look at
the girls' figures?


504
00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:52.074
- I may not know much about art,

505
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.177
but I sure know what I like.

506
00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:55.679
- How large a class is it?

507
00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:57.447
- Just me and the model.

508
00:26:57.482 --> 00:26:58.748
- Well, who's the teacher?

509
00:26:58.784 --> 00:26:59.982
- She is.

510
00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:01.929
- Well, what can a
model teach you?


511
00:27:01.953 --> 00:27:04.588
- You wouldn't believe it.

512
00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:05.822
- No, I wouldn't.

513
00:27:05.858 --> 00:27:08.558
- Last night, she taught
me how to use a roller.


514
00:27:08.593 --> 00:27:09.993
- You paint with a roller?

515
00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:14.231
- Well, I have to. She
says the brush tickles her.


516
00:27:14.266 --> 00:27:15.710
- Speaking of
pot pourri, friends,


517
00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:19.069
here's that part of our show
when we stir the cast up,


518
00:27:19.104 --> 00:27:20.815
serve you a little
bit of everything.


519
00:27:20.839 --> 00:27:23.740
Or, as the French
say, pot pourri.


520
00:27:23.775 --> 00:27:26.643
- The general interest question
most asked this week was,


521
00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:30.580
what made Lance Corporal
Michael Dan stand on his nose


522
00:27:30.616 --> 00:27:35.218
for four and a half hours
during the War of 1812?


523
00:27:35.254 --> 00:27:37.920
- The answer is, the enemy.

524
00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:40.790
(buzzing)

525
00:27:40.826 --> 00:27:45.228
- Hello, NBC, beautiful
downtown Burbank.


526
00:27:45.263 --> 00:27:48.665
How do we decide who
goes through the trap door?


527
00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.967
Oh, anybody who drops in.

528
00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:55.939
- [Gary] What's your hang up?

529
00:27:55.974 --> 00:28:00.343
- My hang up is, I hate
the telephone company.


530
00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:03.179
The noise, having
telephone books,


531
00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:05.549
high bills, wrong numbers.

532
00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:08.184
Hello? Hello, Hello?

533
00:28:08.921 --> 00:28:10.119
And that's another thing.

534
00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:14.858
You can never get repair
service when you need it.


535
00:28:14.893 --> 00:28:16.270
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.


536
00:28:16.294 --> 00:28:19.396
Tonight's health hint is how
to avoid the Hong Kong flu.


537
00:28:19.431 --> 00:28:20.875
Now, if you follow
the prescription,


538
00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:22.432
there is nothing to fear.

539
00:28:22.468 --> 00:28:27.371
Just take lots of vitamin
A, some vitamin B12,


540
00:28:27.406 --> 00:28:32.376
of course, vitamin D, and
vitamin G, ladies and gentlemen,


541
00:28:32.411 --> 00:28:35.812
and just a touch
of ascorbic acid.


542
00:28:35.848 --> 00:28:38.014
Now, if you will
follow this dosage,


543
00:28:38.049 --> 00:28:40.584
you will have no worries
about the Hong Kong flu.


544
00:28:40.619 --> 00:28:43.353
Now, next week, we will
tell you how to recover


545
00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:46.456
from Watson's disease,
which is, you guessed it,


546
00:28:46.492 --> 00:28:50.794
it comes from taking a
combination of vitamins A, D, G, B12,


547
00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:53.697
and just a touch
of ascorbic acid.


548
00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:55.933
Sir? Sir?

549
00:28:57.969 --> 00:29:00.203
- I think Hedgley
bought it over the Seine.


550
00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:02.438
- Huh. Good man, Hedgley.

551
00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:05.441
Look, a lone German fighter
approaching the air field.


552
00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:07.077
- Where?
- There.


553
00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:10.713
- He's dropping Hedgley's boots.

554
00:29:10.748 --> 00:29:13.449
- Yes, and isn't that
Hedgley still in them?


555
00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:14.950
- By god, it is.

556
00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:17.086
- Umbrella, sir?

557
00:29:17.122 --> 00:29:18.788
- Very interesting.

558
00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:22.259
And we lost that one, too.

559
00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:27.063
- Madame, do you want this
soap scented or unscented?


560
00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.664
- I'll take it with me.

561
00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.700
- What?

562
00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.838
- [Gary] Stranger than Truth.

563
00:29:34.873 --> 00:29:38.107
- Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Sidney of Wakeeshaw, Illinois


564
00:29:38.142 --> 00:29:40.577
had a childless
marriage for 12 years.


565
00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:44.247
Despondent, Mr. Sidney
lost job after job. Poor thing.


566
00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:46.427
Their poverty deepened
until early one morning


567
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:49.386
Mrs. Sidney opened the
door and found a basket


568
00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:52.922
on the doorstep with a note
saying, take care of my baby.


569
00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:54.769
Well, reporters asked
if this would change


570
00:29:54.793 --> 00:29:56.459
their economic situation.

571
00:29:56.495 --> 00:29:59.496
Mr. Sidney's eyes glistened
as he turned and said,


572
00:29:59.531 --> 00:30:00.830
it certainly will.

573
00:30:00.866 --> 00:30:02.131
Now that we have this basket,

574
00:30:02.166 --> 00:30:05.001
Mrs. Sidney can take in washing.

575
00:30:05.036 --> 00:30:06.102
Burned!

576
00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:14.611
(upbeat music)

577
00:30:18.983 --> 00:30:21.317
(humming)

578
00:30:28.226 --> 00:30:29.426
- Attention!

579
00:30:32.064 --> 00:30:33.863
Would you care for a blindfold?

580
00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:37.433
- No, but you might put
one on the men with the rifle.


581
00:30:37.469 --> 00:30:39.380
- Would you care
for some dessert, sir?


582
00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:41.415
- Oh, I don't think so,
my dear, thank you.


583
00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:44.540
- Oh, it'll do you good, sir.

584
00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:46.120
- Very well, I'll
have the usual.


585
00:30:46.144 --> 00:30:48.122
- Fine, I'll put the
lights out down here


586
00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:50.213
and bring it right up.

587
00:30:56.555 --> 00:30:57.620
- Jawbreaker.

588
00:30:59.591 --> 00:31:01.903
- (in high-pitched voice)
Hello. My name is Tiny Tim.


589
00:31:01.927 --> 00:31:04.727
(in deep voice) How does
that grab ya, secret lovers?


590
00:31:04.763 --> 00:31:08.097
- I call myself Tiny Tim
because somebody else


591
00:31:08.133 --> 00:31:11.267
uses my real name, John Wayne.

592
00:31:11.302 --> 00:31:12.702
- Tiny Tim is alive,

593
00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:15.972
and flying over beautiful
downtown Burbank.


594
00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:18.274
- A negro family
moved into Burbank


595
00:31:18.309 --> 00:31:22.178
and the property values
have gone up 40 percent.


596
00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:23.613
- That's a no-no.

597
00:31:23.648 --> 00:31:26.582
- I'll never forget playing
opposite Anita Eckbert.


598
00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:29.085
She made a great
impression on me.


599
00:31:29.121 --> 00:31:31.120
- That's another no-no.

600
00:31:31.156 --> 00:31:33.890
- Here comes
the big finish, folk.


601
00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:35.291
- I love working with Doris Day.

602
00:31:35.326 --> 00:31:39.061
She's completely untouched
by all that fame and fortune.


603
00:31:39.097 --> 00:31:40.497
And if you've seen our movies,

604
00:31:40.532 --> 00:31:42.933
you know she's
completely untouched.


605
00:31:42.968 --> 00:31:45.936
- Say, speaking of airplanes,
I've been meaning to ask ya,


606
00:31:45.971 --> 00:31:48.038
how's your weekend?

607
00:31:48.073 --> 00:31:50.106
- 'Bout the same
as my strong end.


608
00:31:50.142 --> 00:31:51.142
Ba-dum-bum.

609
00:31:51.176 --> 00:31:52.420
- You really got
'em tonight, huh?


610
00:31:52.444 --> 00:31:53.944
- Yeah, one after the other.

611
00:31:53.979 --> 00:31:55.219
- I'm talking about the farm.

612
00:31:55.247 --> 00:31:57.125
Didn't you spend a
weekend on a farm?


613
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:58.481
- That's funny, so did I.

614
00:31:58.516 --> 00:32:00.661
- Oh, well, quite a
coincidence. Where were you?


615
00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:01.517
- My aunt's place.

616
00:32:01.553 --> 00:32:03.619
- I don't think I
ever met your aunt.


617
00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:05.800
- Sure, the little thing,
about three foot tall.


618
00:32:05.824 --> 00:32:07.090
- Perfect 36.

619
00:32:07.125 --> 00:32:08.925
- That's funny, so's my aunt.

620
00:32:08.961 --> 00:32:09.971
- Three feet tall, that's 36.

621
00:32:09.995 --> 00:32:11.761
- That's a yard stick.

622
00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:12.996
- Yes, sir.

623
00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:14.675
- You know my uncle
found her in a butcher shop.


624
00:32:14.699 --> 00:32:15.565
- Oh?
- Mm.


625
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.811
- How do you like that line? Oh?

626
00:32:16.835 --> 00:32:18.479
- Oh, I like it. You
did that well, too.


627
00:32:18.503 --> 00:32:20.903
He went in for an order of
short ribs, and there she was.


628
00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:22.016
- Really fell for her, huh?

629
00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.050
- No, he tripped over her.

630
00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:24.852
- Tripped over
her. What'd she do?


631
00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:28.411
- Well, she jumped up and
punched him in the knee.


632
00:32:28.446 --> 00:32:29.713
- What's she do for a living?

633
00:32:29.748 --> 00:32:32.214
- Well, she was a
short-order cook.


634
00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.361
- Now, what's a three-foot woman

635
00:32:33.385 --> 00:32:35.285
doing behind a lunch counter?

636
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.786
- A lot of this.

637
00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:39.422
- Must draw quite a crowd.

638
00:32:39.458 --> 00:32:40.501
- Don't ever order the soup.

639
00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:41.924
- No, I wouldn't do that.

640
00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.604
Hey, I bet you had a
lot of fun on the farm.


641
00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:44.839
Did you help with the chores?

642
00:32:44.863 --> 00:32:47.296
- Well, I spent all day
Sunday picking olives.


643
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:48.297
- Good for you.

644
00:32:48.332 --> 00:32:49.965
- Then we had to quit.

645
00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:53.503
- Olive got sore.
- Olive got sore.


646
00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:55.449
- Hey, I'll bet your
aunt loves farm life.


647
00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.106
- Not since she broke her toe.

648
00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:58.574
- Well, accidents will happen.

649
00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.177
- She kicked an egg
in a chicken coop.


650
00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:02.411
- Kicked an egg.

651
00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:05.015
What's a three-foot woman
doing in a chicken coop?


652
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:06.750
- Duckin' the rooster.

653
00:33:07.686 --> 00:33:09.597
- Well, I suppose
she has to be careful.


654
00:33:09.621 --> 00:33:12.421
- Not anymore, the
rooster ran away.


655
00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:15.058
- Easy come, easy go.
Just keep 'em goin', Dick.


656
00:33:15.093 --> 00:33:17.494
- No, she threw a saddle
on the duck and followed him.


657
00:33:17.529 --> 00:33:18.494
- Now, wait a minute.

658
00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:20.174
You can't throw a
saddle on a duck,


659
00:33:20.198 --> 00:33:22.565
and you can't break
your toe kicking an egg.


660
00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.611
Now why do you say
such stupid things?


661
00:33:24.635 --> 00:33:26.047
- 'Cause if I didn't
say such stupid things,


662
00:33:26.071 --> 00:33:29.038
we'd be lucky to get a guest
shot on My Mother the Car.


663
00:33:29.074 --> 00:33:31.941
- Ha, ha, ha, that show
was cancelled two years ago.


664
00:33:31.976 --> 00:33:34.577
- Now will you listen to me?

665
00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:36.812
- No, but I'll listen to Goldie.

666
00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:39.115
- Welcome to Laugh
In's Question of the Week.


667
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.284
The question most
asked this week was,


668
00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:44.921
who was the tallest
boxer in the world?


669
00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:48.825
The tallest boxer in the
world was Battling Bill Baker,


670
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.227
who was eight foot three.

671
00:33:51.262 --> 00:33:53.596
- In answer to the second
most asked question,


672
00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:56.800
the strangest medical
case on file was the case


673
00:33:56.835 --> 00:34:01.604
of cauliflower navel,
owned by Battling Bill Baker.


674
00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:05.942
- Wait a minute! Is that
another Battling Billy Baker joke?


675
00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:06.977
That's rude.

676
00:34:07.979 --> 00:34:10.913
- If the dancing maiden could
take the buzz from the bee,


677
00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:13.716
what would she do
with the turkey's gobble?


678
00:34:13.752 --> 00:34:17.086
- You, you probably
think I'm a little strange


679
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:20.189
standing here talking into a
phone that's not connected,


680
00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:21.969
but there's a
logical explanation.


681
00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:24.360
I'm talking to Shelly Berman.

682
00:34:24.396 --> 00:34:26.695
- Blow in his ear and
he'll follow you anywhere.


683
00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.998
- You bet your sweet bippy.

684
00:34:29.033 --> 00:34:30.433
- You bet your own bippy.

685
00:34:30.468 --> 00:34:32.101
- Hey, what's a bippy?

686
00:34:32.137 --> 00:34:33.603
- Show 'em your bippy.

687
00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:35.337
- Looking into the future,

688
00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:38.474
here is the beautiful
downtown Burbank PTA


689
00:34:38.509 --> 00:34:42.078
and roller derby team
with a typical Burbank look


690
00:34:42.113 --> 00:34:43.579
into the future.

691
00:34:47.619 --> 00:34:53.123
Shall we sing about
The good old days


692
00:34:54.559 --> 00:35:01.597
When everything
seemed So sweet and pure


693
00:35:03.268 --> 00:35:09.639
And Hong Kong flu
Didn't have a cure


694
00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:14.077
Good old days

695
00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:20.817
You didn't live long

696
00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:24.587
Talk about the
days before the pill


697
00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:26.923
When families grew to be immense

698
00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:29.358
'Cause people were
caused by accidents


699
00:35:29.394 --> 00:35:32.361
Those good, old days
Who could forget those


700
00:35:32.397 --> 00:35:36.132
Bread lines, we're
stuck in those bread lines


701
00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:38.367
While reading those headlines

702
00:35:38.403 --> 00:35:41.837
Announcing another
bank is falling to pieces


703
00:35:41.872 --> 00:35:44.040
Talk about the
days before the jets


704
00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:46.675
When traveling took
you weeks and weeks


705
00:35:46.711 --> 00:35:49.078
And most of the bloom
right off your cheeks


706
00:35:49.114 --> 00:35:51.680
Those good, old days

707
00:35:51.716 --> 00:35:56.652
What's so good about
the good, old days


708
00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:58.921
Talk about the days before TV

709
00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:01.457
Your intellect could
expand and grow


710
00:36:01.493 --> 00:36:03.993
By sitting and watching radio

711
00:36:04.029 --> 00:36:06.529
Those good, old days
It hasn't changed much


712
00:36:06.564 --> 00:36:08.764
Talk about the clothes
we used to wear


713
00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:11.401
The gigolo look was really bad

714
00:36:11.436 --> 00:36:13.503
And whale-boned
corsets drove you mad


715
00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:16.472
Those good, old days
We used to do the


716
00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:20.243
Conga, remember the conga

717
00:36:20.278 --> 00:36:22.611
With Madame Wasanka

718
00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:26.248
That dance was as dumb
as any dances we do now


719
00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:28.384
Talk about the days
between the wars


720
00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:30.786
When nobody fought or picketed

721
00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:33.256
But everyone sure was bigoted

722
00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:35.791
Those good, old days

723
00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:38.361
What's so good
about the Charleston


724
00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:40.763
What's so good about (mumbles)

725
00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:43.165
What's so good
about the good, old


726
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:45.668
Doolie, atta, doolie,
atta, doolie, atta, doo


727
00:36:45.704 --> 00:36:48.070
What's so good about depression

728
00:36:48.105 --> 00:36:50.673
What's so kinky 'bout
swallowing goldfish


729
00:36:50.708 --> 00:36:53.075
What's so good
about the good, old


730
00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:55.678
Doolie, atta, doolie,
atta, doolie, atta, doo


731
00:36:55.714 --> 00:36:58.548
What's so good
about the good, old


732
00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:03.252
Days, days,
day-de-days - Attention!


733
00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:17.010
- That cigarette
tastes terrible.


734
00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:22.070
But it does keep me alive
a silly millimeter longer.


735
00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:24.707
(piano music)

736
00:37:28.379 --> 00:37:29.379
- Cram.

737
00:37:31.649 --> 00:37:34.250
(silly music)

738
00:37:43.828 --> 00:37:46.295
- It's sure great of ya to
make the tapioca pudding.


739
00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:47.708
- Oh, well we all
miss ya, honey.


740
00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:50.900
- Harold, Harold, someday
will you introduce me


741
00:37:50.935 --> 00:37:52.201
to your brother?

742
00:37:53.337 --> 00:37:54.737
- Oh!

743
00:37:54.773 --> 00:37:57.106
- I think I'll sleep in
late tomorrow, my dear.


744
00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:59.542
- Oh, perhaps you'd
like breakfast in bed, sir.


745
00:37:59.578 --> 00:38:01.611
- That'd be a very good idea.

746
00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:05.815
Um, I'll have orange
juice, whole wheat toast,


747
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:08.150
coffee, and bacon and eggs.

748
00:38:08.186 --> 00:38:09.186
- Fine, sir.

749
00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:14.991
- Room service, we'd like
orange juice, toast, whole wheat,


750
00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:19.929
coffee, bacon and eggs for
two, please, at eight o'clock.


751
00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:21.964
(buzzing)

752
00:38:22.934 --> 00:38:26.669
- Hello, NBC, beautiful
downtown Burbank.


753
00:38:27.906 --> 00:38:30.573
Yes, madame, we were
aware that might offend


754
00:38:30.608 --> 00:38:32.942
some of you adults
who watch our program.


755
00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:36.378
But tell me, how
did it grab your kids?


756
00:38:38.115 --> 00:38:40.261
- And now tonight, gang,
our Mod, Mod World's


757
00:38:40.285 --> 00:38:41.784
going to take a look at people.

758
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.420
- Well, what's so special?
Every week we look at people.


759
00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.856
- Yeah, but offbeat people
we're talking about tonight.


760
00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:48.291
The exceptional people.

761
00:38:48.326 --> 00:38:49.258
- Oh, Thelma.

762
00:38:49.294 --> 00:38:50.726
- Thelma?

763
00:38:50.761 --> 00:38:53.707
- Well, she's about as
exceptional as any people I know.


764
00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:55.176
- Well, I don't want
to hear about her.


765
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.167
- I guess anyone who's a
regular of the Green Bay Packers


766
00:38:58.203 --> 00:39:00.214
is pretty exceptional,
if she's a girl.


767
00:39:00.238 --> 00:39:02.705
- Thelma's a regular with
the Green Bay Packers?


768
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.975
- No, but it got
your attention back.


769
00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:09.678
She gave up the Green
Bay Packers last season.


770
00:39:09.714 --> 00:39:10.825
- I don't want to hear about it.

771
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:12.648
- She's a Ram now.

772
00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:15.417
- She's a Los Angeles Ram?

773
00:39:15.452 --> 00:39:17.352
- That's funny, so is Thelma.

774
00:39:17.388 --> 00:39:20.155
- Are you trying to tell me
that one of the Rams is a girl?


775
00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:24.727
- No, I'm trying to tell you
one of the girls is a Ram.


776
00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:25.772
- That couldn't possibly be.

777
00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:27.374
That'd change the
game completely.


778
00:39:27.398 --> 00:39:28.831
- Already has.

779
00:39:28.867 --> 00:39:33.502
You'll notice a lot of the
guys are tackling higher lately.


780
00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:35.771
- All right, smart guy,
which one is she?


781
00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:38.407
- She's the one with
the shoulder pads


782
00:39:38.442 --> 00:39:41.110
that look like they've slipped.

783
00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:42.111
- What's her number?

784
00:39:42.146 --> 00:39:43.991
- Well, in Los Angeles,
it's Crestview 93...


785
00:39:44.015 --> 00:39:45.982
- No, I don't mean that number.

786
00:39:46.017 --> 00:39:48.084
What's the number
on her chest, dummy.


787
00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:50.486
- Well, Thelma's
chest is no dummy.


788
00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:51.788
- I know that.

789
00:39:51.823 --> 00:39:53.467
- Oh, you've tackled
her, too, huh?


790
00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:55.136
- I never tackled
a girl in my life.


791
00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.827
- What are you, some
kind of a pervert?


792
00:39:57.862 --> 00:40:00.562
- I happen to be
completely heterosexual.


793
00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:03.399
- Well, goody, goody for you.

794
00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:06.269
- Heterosexual happens
to mean completely normal.


795
00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:08.737
- Well in that case,
I'll be off on my way


796
00:40:08.773 --> 00:40:09.638
on my heterosexual way.

797
00:40:09.674 --> 00:40:11.007
- Where you goin'?

798
00:40:11.042 --> 00:40:15.078
- Well, I gotta leave now.
I've got a date with a Ram.


799
00:40:15.113 --> 00:40:18.047
- Hey, have I
got a ram for you.

800
00:40:19.851 --> 00:40:22.096
- And so friends, with that
in mind, let's take a look


801
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.187
into our Mod, Mod
World of offbeat people.


802
00:40:25.223 --> 00:40:26.488
- Baaa.

803
00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:29.192
(groovy music)

804
00:40:47.412 --> 00:40:49.344
- [Gary] Only in America.

805
00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:53.215
- America, to me, is
the land of opportunity.


806
00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.918
I mean, as a poor kid, I
put myself through school.


807
00:40:55.953 --> 00:40:59.287
I was stealin' pennies from
pockets in the cloak room.


808
00:40:59.323 --> 00:41:03.125
And after graduating I
went into my own business,


809
00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:04.827
stealin' hubcaps.

810
00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:07.362
Now, I never
squandered my earnings,


811
00:41:07.398 --> 00:41:10.799
but I plowed everything
right back into the business.


812
00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:13.903
And like, at 20, I
had my own mob.


813
00:41:13.938 --> 00:41:19.542
And today, I employ over a
hundred thugs and petty thieves.


814
00:41:19.577 --> 00:41:21.287
Now, I'm not public
enemy number one,


815
00:41:21.311 --> 00:41:25.080
but, as number
two, I try harder.


816
00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:28.517
So, er, as a success
in my chosen field


817
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:33.022
of endeavor and
achievement, I gotta say


818
00:41:33.057 --> 00:41:36.124
that, that, er, God
bless America.


819
00:41:37.728 --> 00:41:39.428
In other words, er, I, er,

820
00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:44.366
I wouldn't be a crook in any
other country in the world.


821
00:41:44.401 --> 00:41:45.901
Thanks youse.

822
00:41:45.937 --> 00:41:48.804
(groovy music)

823
00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:55.144
- And now, the award for
the best actress of the year


824
00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:57.780
for her starring role
in 20th Century's Fox,


825
00:41:57.815 --> 00:42:00.149
goes to Miss Jolene Brand.

826
00:42:02.587 --> 00:42:04.987
(applause)

827
00:42:07.925 --> 00:42:10.293
And accepting the award
for Miss Brand will be


828
00:42:10.328 --> 00:42:14.563
her very best friend and
co-star in 20th Century's Fox,


829
00:42:14.599 --> 00:42:16.732
Miss Bobbi Folsom.

830
00:42:16.768 --> 00:42:19.168
(applause)

831
00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:27.843
- Oh, I can't tell you how
happy I am for Jolene.


832
00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:30.212
She's with her children tonight.

833
00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.892
You know, she doesn't
get to see them much


834
00:42:31.916 --> 00:42:35.017
since the courts took
them away from her.


835
00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:37.486
And I must say that
those who know her


836
00:42:37.522 --> 00:42:39.955
felt the divorce was unfair.

837
00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:44.827
Jolene had tried to stop
drinking, at least on the set.


838
00:42:44.862 --> 00:42:47.129
And who among us would not agree

839
00:42:47.164 --> 00:42:51.133
that a little drinking is
preferable to her previous problem


840
00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:55.304
that we all know
she valiantly kicked.


841
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:58.474
However, tonight
is Jolene's night.


842
00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:04.480
Any 58 year old woman who
can still play romantic leads


843
00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:06.482
deserves something.

844
00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:10.419
Well, Jolene, I know
you're out there somewhere.


845
00:43:10.455 --> 00:43:14.156
And if you can
still see me clearly,


846
00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:16.325
Josie, this is for you.

847
00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:20.663
(groovy music)

848
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:26.101
- And now, episode 3,476

849
00:43:27.972 --> 00:43:29.304
of Soap Opera.

850
00:43:31.242 --> 00:43:36.178
- Jim, as my best
friend, I had to tell you the


851
00:43:36.214 --> 00:43:38.714
(suspenseful chime) the secret

852
00:43:38.749 --> 00:43:40.683
about Betty and George.

853
00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:44.253
- Don't worry, as
your lawyer I know


854
00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:46.722
that if anyone finds out about

855
00:43:46.757 --> 00:43:48.535
(suspenseful chime) the secret

856
00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:50.759
you will never be elected mayor.

857
00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:51.805
(suspenseful chime)

858
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:54.497
The secret is safe with me.

859
00:43:54.532 --> 00:43:55.964
- How do you spell

860
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.567
(suspenseful chime) secret?

861
00:43:58.603 --> 00:44:01.603
- The editor of the
newspaper promised not to use


862
00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:02.679
what you know about

863
00:44:02.707 --> 00:44:03.884
(suspenseful chime) the secret

864
00:44:03.908 --> 00:44:06.441
in a smear campaign to
help the crooked mayor


865
00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:08.010
be re-elected.

866
00:44:08.046 --> 00:44:11.346
- Of course I won't. I
am a woman of ethics.


867
00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:12.414
- Right.

868
00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:16.886
- So, as crooked
mayor, I thank you for


869
00:44:16.921 --> 00:44:19.054
(suspenseful chime) the secret

870
00:44:19.089 --> 00:44:21.390
of Betty and George.

871
00:44:21.425 --> 00:44:24.960
- Although ethically I
can't print the secret,


872
00:44:24.996 --> 00:44:27.596
perhaps you can
spread the scandal


873
00:44:27.632 --> 00:44:29.164
to destroy your opponents.

874
00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:31.266
- I, too, have ethics.

875
00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:36.238
But my wife, the town
slanderer, doesn't.


876
00:44:37.809 --> 00:44:40.709
- Oh gosh, I'm ruined.
Everyone knows


877
00:44:40.744 --> 00:44:43.612
(suspenseful chime) the secret

878
00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:45.580
of Betty and George.

879
00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:50.585
I guess we'll just have
to move to another town.


880
00:44:50.621 --> 00:44:52.354
Will you go with me, George?

881
00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:55.257
- 'Till the end of time, Betty.

882
00:44:57.094 --> 00:44:59.728
(groovy music)

883
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.167
- Our problem, gentlemen,
is to move this entire fleet


884
00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:09.405
from here to here
without refueling.


885
00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:12.374
- I think I have it, sir.

886
00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:16.512
- All right, Wacker,
show us your plan.


887
00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:20.015
(vocalizes machine gun)

888
00:45:22.152 --> 00:45:25.020
(groovy music)

889
00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:35.297
- Actually the British do laugh
heartily at American jokes,


890
00:45:35.332 --> 00:45:36.899
and they'll continue doing so

891
00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:39.668
as long as they
need foreign aid.


892
00:45:39.703 --> 00:45:41.771
- That's not funny.

893
00:45:41.806 --> 00:45:43.906
- Hey, I'm gettin' hungry.

894
00:45:43.941 --> 00:45:45.318
What say after this
show we go over


895
00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:47.776
to Lester Maddox's house
and eat some chicken?


896
00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:49.611
- Now that's funny.

897
00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:51.947
- Russia claims she's
taking Czechoslovakia over


898
00:45:51.983 --> 00:45:53.749
for her own good.

899
00:45:53.784 --> 00:45:57.052
I've been using that line
with my girlfriends for years.


900
00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.487
- That's nice.

901
00:45:58.522 --> 00:46:00.923
- I went to a Gay 90s
party and everyone there


902
00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:03.592
was either gay or 90.

903
00:46:03.628 --> 00:46:04.760
- That's not nice.

904
00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:07.741
- I think that Dan and
Dick will go on together


905
00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:10.466
for a long time, but then again,

906
00:46:10.501 --> 00:46:14.603
I also said that about Ethel
Merman and Ernie Borgnine.


907
00:46:14.639 --> 00:46:17.540
- A recent survey shows that

908
00:46:17.575 --> 00:46:22.377
have television, while only

909
00:46:22.413 --> 00:46:24.780
which means that at the
present moment, this show


910
00:46:24.816 --> 00:46:28.784
is being watched by at
least 3 million dirty people.


911
00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:30.619
- I'll drink to that.

912
00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:37.927
- Come on.

913
00:46:44.568 --> 00:46:46.101
(musical flourish)

914
00:46:46.137 --> 00:46:47.869
- Boo boop dee doop.

915
00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:51.940
- Well, it's time to
say goodnight, Dick.


916
00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:53.208
- Goodnight, Dick.

917
00:46:53.244 --> 00:46:55.945
- I'd like to say, it's a
great honor to be here.


918
00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.280
I'd like to say it,
but I don't lie well.


919
00:46:58.316 --> 00:46:59.514
- Goodnight, Dick.

920
00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:03.219
- Goodnight, Mel. You
wanna borrow my tinkle?


921
00:47:03.254 --> 00:47:05.820
I'm not kidding.
I'm not kidding.


922
00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:07.489
- Where did Big Al go?

923
00:47:07.524 --> 00:47:09.791
- Next week our show
comes to you under water


924
00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:10.937
and it's going to be a...

925
00:47:10.961 --> 00:47:13.628
- See, that's a
funny coincidence.


926
00:47:13.664 --> 00:47:17.299
My aunt was kissing a bugle
player from the Boy Scouts


927
00:47:17.335 --> 00:47:21.136
under water one time in
Clearwater, Florida for 14 hours.


928
00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:22.882
- There are not gonna be
any Boy Scouts on the show.


929
00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:24.306
This is an underwater show...

930
00:47:24.342 --> 00:47:27.075
- I thought perhaps what she
said when she came up for air


931
00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:29.311
would be of
interest to the folks.


932
00:47:29.347 --> 00:47:32.847
- Well, I'm just sitting
here with baited breath.


933
00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:35.451
- That's what she said to him.

934
00:47:36.154 --> 00:47:37.052
- Say goodnight, Dick.

935
00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:37.919
- Goodnight, Dick.

936
00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:39.155
- Goodnight everybody.

937
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:41.590
(applause)

938
00:47:45.796 --> 00:47:47.496
- Alan? Alan?
- Yes.


939
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:49.243
- Alan, did you know
my boyfriend got arrested


940
00:47:49.267 --> 00:47:51.278
for standing around
shooting the bull.


941
00:47:51.302 --> 00:47:53.535
- You can't get arrested
for shooting a bull.


942
00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.804
- Well you can if
you're a matador.


943
00:47:55.839 --> 00:47:58.673
- Was that a chicken
joke? About shooting a bull?


944
00:47:58.709 --> 00:48:02.511
Or bull shooting, as
the case may be. Huh?


945
00:48:06.083 --> 00:48:06.915
- Hey Jo Anne?

946
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:08.049
- Yes, oh, ha ha?

947
00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:09.485
- Can I go watch the eclipse?

948
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.754
- Well, all right, but
don't stand too close,


949
00:48:11.789 --> 00:48:13.722
you little short devil.

950
00:48:15.325 --> 00:48:17.492
- My uncle was on
television last week.


951
00:48:17.528 --> 00:48:19.640
The night before that
he was on the radio.


952
00:48:19.664 --> 00:48:21.374
And the day before
that he was on the floor.


953
00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:25.668
He hasn't made it to the
bedroom once this month.


954
00:48:26.871 --> 00:48:28.916
- Alan, how'd you get
that extra pair of pants


955
00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.272
you bought with your suit?

956
00:48:30.308 --> 00:48:33.041
- I bought an extra jacket.

957
00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:34.354
- Hey, David.
- Yes.


958
00:48:34.378 --> 00:48:36.556
- Oh, tell me, do you
remember when you were born?


959
00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.647
- Oh yeah, I was so excited.

960
00:48:38.683 --> 00:48:42.117
I could hardly wait to get
home and tell my mother about it.


961
00:48:42.152 --> 00:48:43.885
- Shooting the bull.

962
00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:47.500
- What smells like a
herring, tastes like a herring,


963
00:48:47.524 --> 00:48:49.224
and looks like a herring?

964
00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:50.325
- A herring.

965
00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.060
- Oh, you heard it before.

966
00:48:52.096 --> 00:48:53.740
- I did, but it was
about a mackerel.


967
00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:54.764
- Ah.

968
00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.899
Hey Connie!
- Yeah.


969
00:48:57.935 --> 00:49:00.546
- Did you hear they just
launched several giant telescopes


970
00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:01.570
into orbit?

971
00:49:01.605 --> 00:49:03.349
- Yeah, that was the easy
part, but where are they


972
00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:07.275
gonna get the giants
to look through them?


973
00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:10.144
- Have a nice time
tonight. Be good, huh?


974
00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:13.215
- Chelsea, make up your mind.

975
00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:14.482
- Hey, Goldie?

976
00:49:14.518 --> 00:49:15.383
- Yes.

977
00:49:15.419 --> 00:49:17.097
- Goldie, you like
to play ping pong?


978
00:49:17.121 --> 00:49:21.656
- No, it's too dangerous.
I keep falling off the table.


979
00:49:23.094 --> 00:49:24.893
- Henry, do you know what?

980
00:49:24.929 --> 00:49:27.128
You have a cucumber
growing out of your ear.


981
00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:29.832
- Strange, I planted a herring.

982
00:49:30.868 --> 00:49:31.533
- Call Judy.

983
00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:33.868
- I've got a mackerel in my ear.

984
00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:36.505
(silly music)

985
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:08.069
- Yoo hoo! Batman!

986
00:50:12.443 --> 00:50:15.043
(piano music)

987
00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:21.650
- We all miss ya, and
mom misses ya the most.


988
00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:23.785
- You let her in here
and we're through.


989
00:50:23.821 --> 00:50:24.821
- Oh!

990
00:50:28.158 --> 00:50:31.259
- I can't seem to
shake this headache.


991
00:50:31.294 --> 00:50:32.572
- Well, I quite understand, sir.

992
00:50:32.596 --> 00:50:34.607
You know, you're
not used to drinking.


993
00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:36.931
And last night after
only one brandy


994
00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:40.435
you behaved like a maniac
for the rest of the evening.


995
00:50:40.471 --> 00:50:43.805
You even mistook
me for your wife.


996
00:50:43.841 --> 00:50:46.475
- That's frightening.
Well tell me about it.


997
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:47.876
- Certainly, sir.

998
00:50:47.911 --> 00:50:52.447
Why don't we have a brandy
and I'll tell you everything.


999
00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:57.719
(silly music)

1000
00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:18.173
- Get outta here, ya dummy.

1001
00:51:18.209 --> 00:51:20.809
(piano music)

1002
00:51:22.146 --> 00:51:24.779
- This program was
pre-recorded last week in order that


1003
00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:29.951
it might be pre-empted for
the program you have just seen.


1004
00:51:29.986 --> 00:51:33.922
- Very interesting,
but it was a lot funnier


1005
00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:37.626
when I first heard it
on Mert and Marge.


1006
00:51:38.729 --> 00:51:42.096
I never knew what
that meant anyhow.


1007
00:51:42.132 --> 00:51:43.598
Goodnight, Lucy.

1008
00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:45.834
And if Mr. Nielsen calls,

1009
00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:48.336
please tell him you
were watching us.


1010
00:51:48.371 --> 00:51:49.438
Please.

1011
00:51:50.373 --> 00:51:51.840
Goodnight, Gary.

1012
00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:56.512
(one person clapping)

1013
00:51:57.213 --> 00:51:59.681
(NBC tones)
