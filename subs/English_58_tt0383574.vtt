1
00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:29.527
- Why is this happening?
- I don't know.


2
00:02:30.838 --> 00:02:32.999
You look beautiful.

3
00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:37.774
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.


4
00:02:37.845 --> 00:02:41.143
Make way! Let me through!
How dare you!


5
00:02:41.214 --> 00:02:44.707
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?


6
00:02:46.086 --> 00:02:49.021
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.


7
00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:52.650
- Cutler Beckett?
- It's Lord now, actually.


8
00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:59.663
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.


9
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.693
In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer?

10
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.665
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.


11
00:03:13.712 --> 00:03:18.274
- This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
- Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake.


12
00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.818
- Arrest her.
- On what charges?


13
00:03:20.887 --> 00:03:24.548
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

14
00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:28.752
And I have another one
for a Mr. James Norrington.


15
00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:30.987
- Is he present?
- What are the charges?


16
00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:34.794
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.


17
00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:37.299
That wasn't the answer
to the question I asked.


18
00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:41.031
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...


19
00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:44.562
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal


20
00:03:44.642 --> 00:03:47.474
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.


21
00:03:47.544 --> 00:03:50.809
The charge is "conspiring to set free

22
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.612
"a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire


23
00:03:54.684 --> 00:03:58.518
"and condemned to death,
for which the... "


24
00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:02.250
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.


25
00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:07.891
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.


26
00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:09.955
Captain.

27
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.760
Captain Jack Sparrow.

28
00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:16.733
Captain Jack Sparrow.

29
00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:19.036
Yes, I thought you might.

30
00:04:20.809 --> 00:04:26.076
# Fifteen men
on a dead man's chest


31
00:04:26.148 --> 00:04:31.016
# Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

32
00:04:31.087 --> 00:04:36.457
# Drink and the devil
had done for the rest


33
00:04:36.524 --> 00:04:41.188
# Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

34
00:05:03.784 --> 00:05:05.944
Prisoners, come on!

35
00:06:44.046 --> 00:06:46.037
Sorry, mate.

36
00:06:48.183 --> 00:06:51.345
Mind if we make a little side trip?

37
00:06:52.187 --> 00:06:54.519
I didn't think so.

38
00:07:00.694 --> 00:07:04.630
- Not quite according to plan.
- Complications arose, ensued,


39
00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.724
were overcome.

40
00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:11.594
- You got what you went in for, then?
- Mm-hm.


41
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.104
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,


42
00:07:17.177 --> 00:07:20.613
were expecting something
a bit more... shiny,


43
00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:24.913
with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.


44
00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:27.545
And the Royal Navy chasing us
around the Atlantic.


45
00:07:27.622 --> 00:07:30.317
- And the hurricane.
- Aye.


46
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:36.123
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.


47
00:07:37.363 --> 00:07:40.264
- Shiny.
- Aye, shiny.


48
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.391
Is that how you're all feeling?

49
00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:48.839
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?


50
00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:51.239
Walk the plank.

51
00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:54.336
- What did the bird say?
- Do not blame the bird.


52
00:07:54.413 --> 00:07:57.780
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.


53
00:08:05.923 --> 00:08:09.518
- You know that don't do no good.
- It does me.


54
00:08:11.496 --> 00:08:14.828
- It's a key.
- No. Much more better.


55
00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:18.800
It is a drawing of a key.

56
00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:27.108
Gentlemen,

57
00:08:27.177 --> 00:08:29.111
what do keys do?

58
00:08:30.113 --> 00:08:32.012
Keys...

59
00:08:32.082 --> 00:08:34.448
unlock things?

60
00:08:34.518 --> 00:08:38.352
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.


61
00:08:38.422 --> 00:08:41.687
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.


62
00:08:41.758 --> 00:08:43.418
No.

63
00:08:43.993 --> 00:08:47.895
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.


64
00:08:47.962 --> 00:08:51.865
So what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,


65
00:08:51.934 --> 00:08:56.393
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?


66
00:08:56.472 --> 00:08:58.804
So we're going after this key.

67
00:08:59.742 --> 00:09:02.209
You're not making any sense at all.

68
00:09:02.744 --> 00:09:04.713
Any more questions?

69
00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:07.305
So... do we have a heading?

70
00:09:07.382 --> 00:09:09.543
Ha. A heading.

71
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.981
Set sail in a...

72
00:09:15.022 --> 00:09:16.958
general...

73
00:09:21.731 --> 00:09:23.629
that-way direction.

74
00:09:23.697 --> 00:09:24.892
Captain?

75
00:09:24.965 --> 00:09:29.732
Come on, snap to and make sail. You
know how this works. Go on. Oi, oi, oi!


76
00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:35.572
Have you noticed lately

77
00:09:35.642 --> 00:09:40.271
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?


78
00:09:40.346 --> 00:09:43.145
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.


79
00:09:43.217 --> 00:09:46.243
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,


80
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.187
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.


81
00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:06.996
Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.


82
00:10:07.072 --> 00:10:09.405
Those won't be necessary.

83
00:10:13.111 --> 00:10:17.947
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.


84
00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:23.979
We wish for you
to act as our agent

85
00:10:24.054 --> 00:10:28.185
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.


86
00:10:28.259 --> 00:10:30.659
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?


87
00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:33.696
We've had dealings in the past.

88
00:10:34.565 --> 00:10:38.263
And we've each
left our mark on the other.


89
00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:40.735
What mark did he leave on you?

90
00:10:43.307 --> 00:10:47.141
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.


91
00:10:47.211 --> 00:10:49.303
I would like you to go to him

92
00:10:49.379 --> 00:10:53.941
and recover a certain property
in his possession.


93
00:10:54.017 --> 00:10:56.748
Recover. At the point of a sword?

94
00:10:57.353 --> 00:10:59.344
Bargain.

95
00:11:05.595 --> 00:11:07.755
Letters of marque.

96
00:11:08.998 --> 00:11:11.591
You will offer
what amounts to a full pardon.


97
00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:15.934
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.


98
00:11:16.638 --> 00:11:21.473
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.


99
00:11:21.543 --> 00:11:23.636
Freedom.

100
00:11:24.546 --> 00:11:27.947
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

101
00:11:28.016 --> 00:11:29.915
The world is shrinking,

102
00:11:29.984 --> 00:11:33.443
the blank edges of the map filled in.

103
00:11:33.522 --> 00:11:37.423
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.


104
00:11:37.491 --> 00:11:40.256
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

105
00:11:40.329 --> 00:11:43.196
You and your fiancĂ©e
face the hangman's noose.


106
00:11:43.898 --> 00:11:48.665
- So you get Jack and the Black Pearl.
- The Black Pearl?


107
00:11:48.737 --> 00:11:52.934
- The property you want that he possesses.
- A ship? Hardly.


108
00:11:53.007 --> 00:11:57.103
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,


109
00:11:57.178 --> 00:12:00.772
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.


110
00:12:00.847 --> 00:12:03.474
A compass?

111
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.711
Ah, you know it.

112
00:12:07.053 --> 00:12:11.456
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.


113
00:12:36.848 --> 00:12:39.180
Why is the rum always gone?

114
00:12:45.124 --> 00:12:47.647
Oh.

115
00:12:47.724 --> 00:12:50.319
That's why.

116
00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:58.325
As you were, gents.

117
00:13:29.498 --> 00:13:31.490
Ah.

118
00:13:33.469 --> 00:13:35.437
Time's run out, Jack.

119
00:13:53.923 --> 00:13:56.550
Bootstrap.

120
00:13:56.624 --> 00:13:58.786
Bill Turner.

121
00:14:03.565 --> 00:14:05.930
You look good, Jack.

122
00:14:12.673 --> 00:14:14.904
Is this a dream?

123
00:14:14.975 --> 00:14:16.374
No.

124
00:14:16.443 --> 00:14:20.072
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.


125
00:14:27.955 --> 00:14:30.444
You got the Pearl back, I see.

126
00:14:31.157 --> 00:14:34.990
I had some help retrieving the Pearl,
by the way.


127
00:14:36.129 --> 00:14:38.619
Your son.

128
00:14:38.698 --> 00:14:41.167
William?

129
00:14:41.934 --> 00:14:44.332
He ended up a pirate after all.

130
00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.128
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?


131
00:14:49.207 --> 00:14:51.369
He sent me.

132
00:14:52.711 --> 00:14:55.373
Davy Jones.

133
00:14:55.447 --> 00:14:58.040
Oh.

134
00:14:58.116 --> 00:15:00.141
So it's you, then.

135
00:15:01.752 --> 00:15:05.085
He shanghaied you
into service, eh?


136
00:15:05.157 --> 00:15:07.181
I chose it.

137
00:15:07.259 --> 00:15:12.252
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.


138
00:15:13.064 --> 00:15:15.589
I stood up for you.

139
00:15:15.666 --> 00:15:18.567
Everything went wrong after that.

140
00:15:20.272 --> 00:15:25.106
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,


141
00:15:25.176 --> 00:15:28.111
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.


142
00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:30.703
Unable to move.

143
00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:34.047
Unable to die, Jack.

144
00:15:34.118 --> 00:15:39.713
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.


145
00:15:40.322 --> 00:15:42.588
I would trade anything for it.

146
00:15:44.661 --> 00:15:47.891
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.


147
00:15:47.964 --> 00:15:50.626
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

148
00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.361
He raised the Pearl
from the depths for you.


149
00:15:53.435 --> 00:15:55.494
13 years, you've been her captain.

150
00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:57.505
- Technically...
- Jack.


151
00:15:57.573 --> 00:16:00.007
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.


152
00:16:00.075 --> 00:16:02.838
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.


153
00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:07.245
One soul bound to crew

154
00:16:07.315 --> 00:16:09.750
The Flying Dutchman
already has a captain...


155
00:16:09.818 --> 00:16:12.184
Then it's the locker for you!

156
00:16:12.253 --> 00:16:15.484
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

157
00:16:15.556 --> 00:16:19.890
and drag the Pearl back to the depths
and you along with it.


158
00:16:20.796 --> 00:16:25.425
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?


159
00:16:26.367 --> 00:16:28.300
I already told you, Jack.

160
00:16:30.238 --> 00:16:32.569
Your time is up.

161
00:16:33.475 --> 00:16:35.498
It comes now,

162
00:16:35.576 --> 00:16:40.910
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.


163
00:16:50.023 --> 00:16:53.288
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!


164
00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.692
On deck! Scurry!

165
00:16:55.762 --> 00:17:00.323
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!


166
00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:04.200
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!


167
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:08.730
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!


168
00:17:08.808 --> 00:17:12.140
- Do we have a heading?
- Argh! Run! Land.


169
00:17:17.283 --> 00:17:20.979
- Which port?
- I didn't say "port," I said "land. " Any land.


170
00:17:27.392 --> 00:17:30.589
- Jack's hat! Bring her about!
- No, no!


171
00:17:30.663 --> 00:17:32.959
Leave it!

172
00:17:33.597 --> 00:17:36.031
Run.

173
00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.995
Back to your stations,
the lot of you!


174
00:17:48.579 --> 00:17:50.240
- Jack?
- Shh.


175
00:17:50.314 --> 00:17:55.775
For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what's coming after us?


176
00:17:55.853 --> 00:17:57.616
Nothing.

177
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:15.256
- Here, now, you can't be here.
- I think you'll find he can.


178
00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:16.794
Mr. Swann!

179
00:19:16.862 --> 00:19:18.956
Governor Swann, still.

180
00:19:19.032 --> 00:19:22.296
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?


181
00:19:22.368 --> 00:19:25.995
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?


182
00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:30.235
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.


183
00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:32.869
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.


184
00:19:32.946 --> 00:19:36.609
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.


185
00:19:36.683 --> 00:19:39.241
Is that a lack of faith in Jack
or in me?


186
00:19:39.318 --> 00:19:41.616
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow


187
00:19:41.687 --> 00:19:45.623
does not mean
he would do the same for anyone else.


188
00:19:45.691 --> 00:19:49.126
Now, where is that dog with the keys?

189
00:19:50.661 --> 00:19:53.222
I have faith in you.

190
00:19:53.297 --> 00:19:55.891
Both of you.

191
00:19:57.402 --> 00:20:00.131
Where will you find him?

192
00:20:00.204 --> 00:20:04.937
Tortuga. I'll start there
and I won't stop searching till I find him.


193
00:20:05.375 --> 00:20:08.811
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.


194
00:20:08.878 --> 00:20:12.177
- Properly?
- Eagerly, if you'll still have me.


195
00:20:13.282 --> 00:20:17.310
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.


196
00:20:23.793 --> 00:20:28.321
- I'll wait for you.
- Keep a weather eye on the horizon.


197
00:20:37.807 --> 00:20:39.966
Captain Jack Sparrow?

198
00:20:41.009 --> 00:20:45.413
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.


199
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.349
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.


200
00:20:49.417 --> 00:20:53.787
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.


201
00:20:53.855 --> 00:20:55.881
Jack Sparrow?

202
00:20:55.957 --> 00:20:58.017
I haven't seen him in a month.

203
00:20:58.092 --> 00:21:01.892
When you find him,
will you give him a message?


204
00:21:02.964 --> 00:21:05.489
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

205
00:21:05.566 --> 00:21:08.262
but there's an island
just south of the straits


206
00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:10.668
where I trade spice for...

207
00:21:10.738 --> 00:21:13.399
mm, delicious long pork.

208
00:21:15.043 --> 00:21:19.102
Cannot say about Jack,
but you'll find a ship there.


209
00:21:19.178 --> 00:21:21.511
A ship with black sails.

210
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.888
My brother will take you ashore.

211
00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.669
- What's wrong? The beach is there.
- C'est trop dangereux.


212
00:21:44.737 --> 00:21:48.195
- What?
- C'est trop dangereux. je vous I'avais dit.


213
00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.700
Bon voyage. monsieur.

214
00:22:16.701 --> 00:22:19.190
Jack!

215
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:21.260
Jack Sparrow!

216
00:22:27.177 --> 00:22:29.168
Marty!

217
00:22:30.013 --> 00:22:31.775
Cotton!

218
00:22:32.715 --> 00:22:34.707
Anybody?

219
00:22:40.057 --> 00:22:42.719
- Ah. A familiar face.

220
00:22:42.792 --> 00:22:44.556
Don't eat me.

221
00:22:44.627 --> 00:22:47.653
- I'm not going to eat you.
- Don't eat me.


222
00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.291
No. Don't eat me.

223
00:23:01.243 --> 00:23:03.235
Gibbs.

224
00:23:33.473 --> 00:23:35.500
Come on! Let's go!

225
00:23:38.579 --> 00:23:40.444
Come on! Who wants it?

226
00:23:43.284 --> 00:23:45.615
I can do this all day!

227
00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.538
Jack?

228
00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:54.014
Jack Sparrow!

229
00:24:54.084 --> 00:24:56.678
I can honestly say
I'm glad to see you.


230
00:25:05.428 --> 00:25:07.395
Jack, it's me.

231
00:25:07.463 --> 00:25:08.793
Will Turner.

232
00:25:15.404 --> 00:25:19.033
- Tell them to let me down!

233
00:25:19.842 --> 00:25:21.832
...eensy-weensy.

234
00:25:27.916 --> 00:25:31.817
...eunuchy. Snip, snip.

235
00:25:31.886 --> 00:25:34.150
Eunuchy.

236
00:25:36.991 --> 00:25:39.425
Jack, the compass.
That's all I need.


237
00:25:39.494 --> 00:25:42.588
Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for helping you.


238
00:25:42.664 --> 00:25:44.996
She faces the gallows!

239
00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.436
Savvy?

240
00:26:00.713 --> 00:26:03.148
Save me.

241
00:26:03.216 --> 00:26:05.309
Jack, what did you tell them?

242
00:26:05.384 --> 00:26:07.444
No!

243
00:26:07.888 --> 00:26:10.186
What about Elizabeth?

244
00:26:10.257 --> 00:26:11.849
Jack!

245
00:26:11.925 --> 00:26:16.919
That's a good girl.
Come a little closer.


246
00:26:16.996 --> 00:26:21.365
- We don't bite.
- Go on. We won't bite you.


247
00:26:23.869 --> 00:26:26.496
Come quickly.

248
00:26:26.572 --> 00:26:29.836
- Tell me what's happening.
- Our name still has some standing.


249
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:33.275
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.


250
00:26:33.345 --> 00:26:35.506
No! Will's gone to find Jack!

251
00:26:35.581 --> 00:26:37.639
We cannot count on William Turner.

252
00:26:37.716 --> 00:26:40.879
- Come!
- He's better than you give him credit for.


253
00:26:40.952 --> 00:26:44.411
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only -


254
00:26:44.489 --> 00:26:46.854
one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.


255
00:26:46.924 --> 00:26:48.655
Even if Will succeeds,

256
00:26:48.727 --> 00:26:54.790
do not ask me to endure the sight of my
daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.


257
00:26:54.866 --> 00:26:59.302
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.


258
00:26:59.371 --> 00:27:04.466
- A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
- Then there is nothing left for you here.


259
00:27:08.512 --> 00:27:10.502
Whoa!

260
00:27:11.582 --> 00:27:13.742
Wait inside.

261
00:27:14.852 --> 00:27:16.843
Captain?

262
00:27:19.356 --> 00:27:21.346
Captain.

263
00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:29.530
Evening, Governor.

264
00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:31.589
Shame, that.

265
00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:33.794
He was carrying this.

266
00:27:33.869 --> 00:27:36.600
It's a letter to the king.

267
00:27:36.672 --> 00:27:39.003
- It's from you.
- No...


268
00:27:42.377 --> 00:27:44.573
Elizabeth.

269
00:27:45.314 --> 00:27:47.679
What are you doing?

270
00:27:50.385 --> 00:27:52.875
- Where is she?
- Who?


271
00:28:10.637 --> 00:28:14.835
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,


272
00:28:14.908 --> 00:28:17.207
as your father believes.

273
00:28:18.012 --> 00:28:20.673
Then what is?

274
00:28:20.748 --> 00:28:24.012
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.


275
00:28:24.084 --> 00:28:29.385
I expect, then, we can come
to some sort of understanding.


276
00:28:29.457 --> 00:28:32.653
- I'm here to negotiate.
- I'm listening.


277
00:28:35.195 --> 00:28:37.493
I'm listening intently.

278
00:28:39.364 --> 00:28:41.833
These letters of marque
are signed by the king.


279
00:28:41.901 --> 00:28:46.634
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.


280
00:28:46.706 --> 00:28:49.434
Or else I would not still be here.

281
00:28:49.507 --> 00:28:53.603
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.


282
00:28:53.678 --> 00:28:57.409
- It will do you no good.
- Do explain.


283
00:28:57.483 --> 00:29:02.249
I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.


284
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:04.414
There is something
you need to know.


285
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.616
Ah, I see.

286
00:29:06.691 --> 00:29:09.785
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta


287
00:29:09.862 --> 00:29:13.024
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.


288
00:29:13.765 --> 00:29:16.198
But you mustn't worry.

289
00:29:16.734 --> 00:29:20.134
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

290
00:29:20.204 --> 00:29:22.695
My desires are not so provincial.

291
00:29:23.441 --> 00:29:27.707
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.


292
00:29:28.946 --> 00:29:33.006
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.


293
00:29:35.485 --> 00:29:40.387
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.


294
00:29:40.456 --> 00:29:42.618
So I did.

295
00:29:44.527 --> 00:29:46.861
A marriage interrupted...

296
00:29:49.164 --> 00:29:51.861
or fate intervenes?

297
00:29:52.568 --> 00:29:55.902
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.


298
00:29:55.972 --> 00:29:58.495
- These aren't going to Jack.
- Oh, really?


299
00:29:58.573 --> 00:30:01.338
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom, then,

300
00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:04.976
I'll still want that compass.

301
00:30:05.047 --> 00:30:08.675
Consider that in your calculations.

302
00:30:28.303 --> 00:30:31.362
I say it was Divine Providence
what escaped us from jail.


303
00:30:31.439 --> 00:30:34.169
And I say it was me being clever.

304
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:38.003
Ain't that right, poochie?

305
00:30:38.078 --> 00:30:42.275
Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine
Providence what inspired you to be clever?


306
00:30:42.349 --> 00:30:44.510
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

307
00:30:44.585 --> 00:30:49.886
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?


308
00:30:49.956 --> 00:30:54.586
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.


309
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:58.494
- You know you can't read.
- It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.


310
00:30:58.564 --> 00:31:04.058
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.
That's a mark against...


311
00:31:05.905 --> 00:31:07.634
Look.

312
00:31:07.707 --> 00:31:09.766
There it is.

313
00:31:14.446 --> 00:31:16.505
What's got into him?

314
00:31:16.581 --> 00:31:18.708
Must have seen a catfish.

315
00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.050
Stupid mongrel!

316
00:31:34.734 --> 00:31:36.723
Argh!

317
00:31:43.908 --> 00:31:45.568
Come on!

318
00:31:53.017 --> 00:31:57.249
- It's ours for the taking.
- Tide's coming in. That should help.


319
00:31:57.321 --> 00:32:00.118
And salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.


320
00:32:00.189 --> 00:32:02.089
There's the truth of it!

321
00:32:09.632 --> 00:32:12.623
Suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,


322
00:32:12.702 --> 00:32:15.932
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.


323
00:32:16.005 --> 00:32:18.666
Amen to that.

324
00:32:34.889 --> 00:32:36.881
Thank you.

325
00:32:53.742 --> 00:32:57.040
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...


326
00:32:57.111 --> 00:32:59.578
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,


327
00:32:59.647 --> 00:33:03.310
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.


328
00:33:03.384 --> 00:33:06.511
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.


329
00:33:06.587 --> 00:33:13.287
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form,


330
00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:19.490
and they intend to do him the honor
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.


331
00:33:23.002 --> 00:33:25.435
They'll roast him and eat him.

332
00:33:26.506 --> 00:33:28.303
Where's the rest of the crew?

333
00:33:28.374 --> 00:33:32.935
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.


334
00:33:35.246 --> 00:33:37.442
The feast is about to begin.

335
00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.244
Jack's life will end

336
00:33:40.319 --> 00:33:42.650
when the drums stop.

337
00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:47.017
Well, we can't just sit here and wait,
then, can we?


338
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.122
No, no. Oi! No, no.

339
00:33:52.196 --> 00:33:55.324
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

340
00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.560
I am Chief. Want big fire.

341
00:33:57.635 --> 00:33:59.796
Come on.

342
00:34:00.605 --> 00:34:03.267
Oi.
Tout de suite.


343
00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.672
Come on. More wood.

344
00:34:32.602 --> 00:34:34.592
Whoa!

345
00:35:14.107 --> 00:35:16.098
Oh, bugger.

346
00:35:25.786 --> 00:35:27.946
A little seasoning, eh?

347
00:35:41.734 --> 00:35:43.361
Well done.

348
00:36:22.706 --> 00:36:26.073
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!


349
00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:31.342
Come on, men!
It'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!


350
00:36:31.415 --> 00:36:34.180
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

351
00:36:34.251 --> 00:36:36.582
About six would do.

352
00:36:40.157 --> 00:36:41.952
Oh, dear.

353
00:36:45.395 --> 00:36:48.057
- Hurry!
- Come on!


354
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.234
Come on! Is that all you got?

355
00:37:01.877 --> 00:37:04.402
- Wait. Stop.
- Eh?


356
00:37:04.881 --> 00:37:07.246
Stop. Shh.

357
00:37:14.422 --> 00:37:16.414
Shh.

358
00:37:19.293 --> 00:37:21.728
- What are they doing?
- Stop.


359
00:37:28.436 --> 00:37:30.996
- Snake!

360
00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.452
Move!

361
00:38:15.647 --> 00:38:18.980
Well, go on, go get them.

362
00:38:23.388 --> 00:38:25.652
No, no. Oi! No, no!

363
00:38:27.992 --> 00:38:29.653
Not good.

364
00:38:45.943 --> 00:38:48.172
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

365
00:39:07.129 --> 00:39:08.960
Roll the cage!

366
00:39:09.032 --> 00:39:11.398
Come on!

367
00:39:35.924 --> 00:39:40.883
- Lift the cage! Hurry!
- Come on, lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.


368
00:40:37.048 --> 00:40:38.413
Run!

369
00:40:52.196 --> 00:40:54.926
This way, lads!

370
00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:18.944
Take cover!

371
00:41:20.157 --> 00:41:21.680
Stop it!

372
00:42:16.777 --> 00:42:18.210
Bugger.

373
00:42:45.771 --> 00:42:48.466
Haul loose the mooring line!

374
00:42:48.539 --> 00:42:50.805
The mooring line!

375
00:42:50.876 --> 00:42:54.573
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!


376
00:42:54.648 --> 00:42:57.945
- Don't bite it!
- Haul loose the mooring line!


377
00:42:58.448 --> 00:43:00.610
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.


378
00:43:00.686 --> 00:43:04.144
- How'd you get it back last time?
- Excellent! Our work's half done.


379
00:43:04.222 --> 00:43:06.713
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.


380
00:43:06.791 --> 00:43:09.726
- Make ready to sail, boys!
- What about Jack?


381
00:43:09.794 --> 00:43:13.161
- I won't leave without him.
- Oi!


382
00:43:21.239 --> 00:43:24.264
- Time to go.
- Cast off those lines!


383
00:43:29.713 --> 00:43:32.614
Aaargh!

384
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:36.041
- Make ready to cast off!
- Oi!


385
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:41.955
Good doggy.

386
00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:03.676
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall
always remember as the day you almost...


387
00:44:06.748 --> 00:44:09.014
Captain Jack Sparrow.

388
00:44:34.742 --> 00:44:37.836
Let's get away from this island
and head out to open sea.


389
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:42.439
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but
only insofar as we keep to the shallows.


390
00:44:42.516 --> 00:44:44.643
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

391
00:44:44.717 --> 00:44:47.881
I have faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills.


392
00:44:47.955 --> 00:44:51.081
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.


393
00:44:56.764 --> 00:44:59.129
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

394
00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:01.996
Have you considered
just locking her up somewhere?


395
00:45:02.068 --> 00:45:04.628
She is locked up,
bound to hang for helping you.


396
00:45:04.703 --> 00:45:09.697
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.


397
00:45:10.976 --> 00:45:13.376
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

398
00:45:13.445 --> 00:45:16.039
I must trade it for her freedom.

399
00:45:18.316 --> 00:45:21.012
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Captain.


400
00:45:21.086 --> 00:45:24.146
We have a need to travel upriver.

401
00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:27.714
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

402
00:45:27.792 --> 00:45:31.593
Fleeting?
As in, say, a passing fancy?


403
00:45:31.663 --> 00:45:35.497
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

404
00:45:35.567 --> 00:45:39.367
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.


405
00:45:39.438 --> 00:45:41.404
William,

406
00:45:41.471 --> 00:45:43.496
I shall trade you the compass

407
00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:45.439
if you will help me

408
00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:47.670
to find this.

409
00:45:51.347 --> 00:45:53.839
- You want me to find this?
- No.


410
00:45:54.951 --> 00:45:57.419
You want you to find this,

411
00:45:57.488 --> 00:46:01.584
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding


412
00:46:01.659 --> 00:46:08.393
and/or locating in your discovering a way
to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.


413
00:46:08.464 --> 00:46:11.299
Savvy?

414
00:46:12.836 --> 00:46:15.395
This is going to save Elizabeth?

415
00:46:17.706 --> 00:46:20.766
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?


416
00:46:23.011 --> 00:46:24.603
Not much.

417
00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.672
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

418
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:56.636
What's all this?

419
00:46:57.211 --> 00:47:02.273
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.


420
00:47:02.349 --> 00:47:05.647
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.


421
00:47:06.186 --> 00:47:08.518
Is it, now? And you?

422
00:47:08.588 --> 00:47:12.718
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.


423
00:47:12.792 --> 00:47:15.283
All the men, they can feel it.

424
00:47:15.361 --> 00:47:19.128
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,


425
00:47:19.199 --> 00:47:21.497
searching for her husband,
lost at sea.


426
00:47:21.568 --> 00:47:24.161
A virgin too, likely as not.

427
00:47:24.237 --> 00:47:26.500
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

428
00:47:26.572 --> 00:47:31.099
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.


429
00:47:31.176 --> 00:47:34.008
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

430
00:47:34.078 --> 00:47:38.175
What we need to do is find out what
the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.


431
00:47:38.249 --> 00:47:40.515
Enough! Enough!

432
00:47:40.586 --> 00:47:44.886
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.


433
00:47:44.957 --> 00:47:48.186
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.


434
00:47:48.258 --> 00:47:50.421
A young woman, by the look of it.

435
00:47:50.496 --> 00:47:53.123
I want you to search the ship
and find her.


436
00:47:53.196 --> 00:47:55.927
Oh, and, er... she's probably naked.

437
00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:28.490
Why is Jack afraid
of the open ocean?


438
00:48:28.565 --> 00:48:30.930
Well, if you believe such things,

439
00:48:31.434 --> 00:48:34.232
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones -


440
00:48:34.303 --> 00:48:38.898
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off


441
00:48:38.975 --> 00:48:42.604
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.


442
00:48:44.245 --> 00:48:46.407
The kraken.

443
00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:52.586
They say the stench
of its breath is like...

444
00:48:52.654 --> 00:48:56.181
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth


445
00:48:56.257 --> 00:49:02.217
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking
odor of a thousand rotting corpses.


446
00:49:04.131 --> 00:49:06.599
If you believe such things.

447
00:49:07.101 --> 00:49:09.535
And the key will spare him that?

448
00:49:09.603 --> 00:49:13.130
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.


449
00:49:13.206 --> 00:49:15.698
Bad enough even to go visit...

450
00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:18.805
her.

451
00:49:18.879 --> 00:49:20.744
Her?

452
00:49:20.814 --> 00:49:22.804
Aye.

453
00:49:57.815 --> 00:50:01.547
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.


454
00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:05.579
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.


455
00:50:05.657 --> 00:50:07.989
Were. Have been.

456
00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.185
Before.

457
00:50:10.262 --> 00:50:13.254
- I'll watch your back.
- It's me front I'm worried about.


458
00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:15.821
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.


459
00:50:16.635 --> 00:50:19.228
- Mind the boat.
- Mind the boat.


460
00:50:19.303 --> 00:50:21.397
- Mind the boat.

461
00:50:21.472 --> 00:50:23.632
Mind the boat.

462
00:50:35.452 --> 00:50:38.751
Jack Sparrow.

463
00:50:38.823 --> 00:50:40.915
Tia Dalma.

464
00:50:41.724 --> 00:50:46.320
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.


465
00:50:50.999 --> 00:50:52.933
You...

466
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.998
You have a touch of...

467
00:50:58.074 --> 00:51:01.440
destiny about you,

468
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.410
William Turner.

469
00:51:05.147 --> 00:51:07.376
You know me?

470
00:51:07.449 --> 00:51:10.076
You want to know me.

471
00:51:10.152 --> 00:51:14.781
There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without it.


472
00:51:14.856 --> 00:51:18.553
- I thought I knew you.
- Not so well as I had hoped.


473
00:51:18.627 --> 00:51:20.787
- Come.
- Come.


474
00:51:24.464 --> 00:51:28.958
What service may I do you?

475
00:51:29.668 --> 00:51:33.628
- You know I demand payment.
- I brought payment.


476
00:51:37.245 --> 00:51:39.235
Look.

477
00:51:40.381 --> 00:51:42.847
An undead monkey.

478
00:51:42.915 --> 00:51:45.078
Top that.

479
00:51:49.023 --> 00:51:52.958
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.


480
00:51:53.393 --> 00:51:55.917
The payment is fair.

481
00:51:55.995 --> 00:51:57.963
We're looking for this.

482
00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:03.331
And what it goes to.

483
00:52:04.805 --> 00:52:09.504
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?


484
00:52:09.575 --> 00:52:13.010
Maybe. Why?

485
00:52:13.077 --> 00:52:15.409
I hear you.

486
00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:19.940
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.


487
00:52:20.552 --> 00:52:22.851
Or do you know,

488
00:52:22.922 --> 00:52:26.858
but are loath to
claim it as your own?

489
00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.652
Your key go to a chest.

490
00:52:41.862 --> 00:52:43.412
yes?

491
00:52:43.488 --> 00:52:46.269
A man of the sea.

492
00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:48.624
A great sailor,

493
00:52:48.695 --> 00:52:53.692
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.


494
00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.746
What vexes all men?

495
00:52:58.281 --> 00:53:00.756
What indeed?

496
00:53:01.299 --> 00:53:03.346
- The sea.
- Sums.


497
00:53:03.423 --> 00:53:06.397
The dichotomy of good and evil.

498
00:53:07.005 --> 00:53:08.723
A woman.

499
00:53:08.995 --> 00:53:10.646
A woman.

500
00:53:10.719 --> 00:53:12.766
He fell in love.

501
00:53:12.842 --> 00:53:15.816
No, no, no, no.
I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.


502
00:53:15.894 --> 00:53:19.829
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.


503
00:53:19.908 --> 00:53:22.259
See, it was a woman

504
00:53:22.329 --> 00:53:25.110
as changing and harsh

505
00:53:25.182 --> 00:53:28.563
and untamable as the sea.

506
00:53:28.631 --> 00:53:31.050
Him never stopped loving her.

507
00:53:31.118 --> 00:53:35.891
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with


508
00:53:35.961 --> 00:53:38.676
but not enough to cause him to die.

509
00:53:40.406 --> 00:53:44.873
What exactly did he put
into the chest?


510
00:53:44.949 --> 00:53:46.907
Him heart.

511
00:53:46.974 --> 00:53:49.088
Literally or figuratively?

512
00:53:49.163 --> 00:53:53.665
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.


513
00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:55.719
Could he?

514
00:53:55.796 --> 00:54:01.857
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.


515
00:54:01.933 --> 00:54:03.618
And so...

516
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:06.371
him carve out him heart,

517
00:54:06.942 --> 00:54:11.646
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.


518
00:54:12.513 --> 00:54:14.595
The key

519
00:54:14.669 --> 00:54:19.171
he keep with him at all times.

520
00:54:19.778 --> 00:54:23.486
- You knew this.
- I did not. I didn't know where the key was.


521
00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:27.801
But now we do. All that's left is to climb
aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key,


522
00:54:27.872 --> 00:54:30.620
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, eh?


523
00:54:30.691 --> 00:54:33.541
Let me see your hand.

524
00:54:47.010 --> 00:54:49.486
The black spot!

525
00:54:50.526 --> 00:54:54.032
- The black spot!
- Black spot!


526
00:54:54.474 --> 00:54:57.549
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.


527
00:54:57.625 --> 00:55:01.062
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?


528
00:55:04.490 --> 00:55:08.032
My little beauty, where are you?

529
00:55:08.106 --> 00:55:11.613
Such a long time in such a mess.

530
00:55:13.645 --> 00:55:16.495
Davy Jones cannot make port.

531
00:55:16.563 --> 00:55:19.877
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.


532
00:55:20.445 --> 00:55:23.657
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,


533
00:55:23.728 --> 00:55:26.273
and so you will carry land with you.

534
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:37.449
Dirt.

535
00:55:38.587 --> 00:55:42.196
- This is a jar of dirt.
- Yes.


536
00:55:47.204 --> 00:55:52.233
It seems we have a need to find
the Flying Dutchman.


537
00:55:55.246 --> 00:55:59.080
A touch of destiny.

538
00:56:14.567 --> 00:56:17.092
That's the Flying Dutchman?

539
00:56:19.004 --> 00:56:21.871
- She doesn't look like much.
- Neither do you.


540
00:56:21.941 --> 00:56:24.273
Do not underestimate her.

541
00:56:25.746 --> 00:56:30.150
- Must have run afoul of the reef.
- So, what's your plan, then?


542
00:56:30.217 --> 00:56:33.709
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.


543
00:56:33.788 --> 00:56:36.154
And if there are crewmen?

544
00:56:36.224 --> 00:56:38.487
I cut down anyone in my path.

545
00:56:39.293 --> 00:56:42.229
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

546
00:56:42.296 --> 00:56:46.427
Your chariot awaits you, Sire.

547
00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:49.730
Oi!

548
00:56:49.805 --> 00:56:55.574
If you do happen to get captured, just say
Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.


549
00:56:55.644 --> 00:56:59.582
- It might save your life.
- Bon voyage!


550
00:57:03.552 --> 00:57:06.148
Douse the lamps.

551
00:57:47.801 --> 00:57:48.892
Sailor.

552
00:57:48.968 --> 00:57:51.563
- Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
- Sailor!


553
00:57:51.639 --> 00:57:54.038
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.


554
00:57:54.107 --> 00:57:56.837
There's no use.
You've run aground.


555
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:58.276
No.

556
00:57:58.346 --> 00:58:00.507
Beneath us.

557
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:03.784
Foul breath.

558
00:58:16.332 --> 00:58:18.858
Hey! Hey!

559
00:58:56.309 --> 00:58:59.210
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

560
00:59:14.127 --> 00:59:18.064
Get back! Get back!

561
00:59:49.633 --> 00:59:53.331
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.


562
01:00:10.455 --> 01:00:13.618
Do you fear death?

563
01:00:15.026 --> 01:00:19.864
Do you fear that dark abyss?

564
01:00:21.733 --> 01:00:24.569
All your deeds laid bare.

565
01:00:25.471 --> 01:00:28.463
All your sins punished.

566
01:00:30.277 --> 01:00:32.837
I can offer you

567
01:00:32.912 --> 01:00:35.380
an escape.

568
01:00:35.447 --> 01:00:38.509
Don't listen to him!

569
01:00:47.161 --> 01:00:50.154
Do you not fear death?

570
01:00:52.634 --> 01:00:55.195
I'll take my chances, sir.

571
01:00:55.271 --> 01:00:57.705
To the depths.

572
01:01:03.178 --> 01:01:05.205
Cruel blackguard!

573
01:01:05.282 --> 01:01:07.442
Life is cruel.

574
01:01:08.385 --> 01:01:11.149
Why should the afterlife
be any different?


575
01:01:11.654 --> 01:01:14.887
I offer you a choice.

576
01:01:14.958 --> 01:01:17.688
Join my crew

577
01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:20.093
and postpone the judgment.

578
01:01:21.498 --> 01:01:24.990
One hundred years before the mast.

579
01:01:27.305 --> 01:01:29.239
Will ye serve?

580
01:01:31.042 --> 01:01:33.033
I
- I will serve.

581
01:01:33.111 --> 01:01:35.580
There.

582
01:01:42.422 --> 01:01:45.914
You are neither dead nor dying.

583
01:01:45.991 --> 01:01:48.619
What is your purpose here?

584
01:01:51.432 --> 01:01:54.595
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.


585
01:01:55.736 --> 01:01:59.035
What is your purpose here?

586
01:01:59.106 --> 01:02:02.270
Jack Sparrow
sent me to settle his debt.


587
01:02:05.246 --> 01:02:07.840
Did he, now?

588
01:02:07.915 --> 01:02:11.373
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

589
01:02:26.803 --> 01:02:27.826
Oh.

590
01:02:28.271 --> 01:02:31.104
You have a debt to pay.

591
01:02:31.174 --> 01:02:34.611
You've been captain of the Black Pearl
for 13 years.


592
01:02:34.677 --> 01:02:36.805
That was our agreement.

593
01:02:36.881 --> 01:02:40.749
Technically I was only captain
for two years, then I was mutinied upon.


594
01:02:40.818 --> 01:02:44.584
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.


595
01:02:44.655 --> 01:02:47.954
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years


596
01:02:48.025 --> 01:02:50.621
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

597
01:02:53.532 --> 01:02:56.524
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.


598
01:02:56.602 --> 01:02:59.867
- One soul is not equal to another.
- Aha!


599
01:02:59.939 --> 01:03:06.470
We've established my proposal is sound
in principle. Now we're haggling over price.


600
01:03:06.546 --> 01:03:09.141
Price?

601
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:14.643
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?


602
01:03:18.425 --> 01:03:21.087
One hundred souls.

603
01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:23.794
Three days.

604
01:03:24.299 --> 01:03:28.201
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.


605
01:03:28.269 --> 01:03:31.397
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.


606
01:03:31.473 --> 01:03:35.465
That leaves you only 99 more to go.

607
01:03:37.179 --> 01:03:39.169
Have you not met Will Turner?

608
01:03:39.247 --> 01:03:42.115
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.


609
01:03:42.184 --> 01:03:44.550
Worth at least four.

610
01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:46.884
Maybe three and a half.

611
01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:50.682
And did I happen to mention...

612
01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.228
he's in love?

613
01:03:54.064 --> 01:03:56.691
With a girl.

614
01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:59.200
Due to be married.

615
01:03:59.269 --> 01:04:01.260
Betrothed.

616
01:04:02.239 --> 01:04:06.939
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel


617
01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:11.005
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony.


618
01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:13.073
Eh?

619
01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:20.723
I keep the boy. 99 souls.

620
01:04:20.793 --> 01:04:23.488
But I wonder, Sparrow,

621
01:04:23.562 --> 01:04:25.793
can you live with this?

622
01:04:26.499 --> 01:04:30.367
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,


623
01:04:30.435 --> 01:04:35.374
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?


624
01:04:38.612 --> 01:04:40.637
Yep. I'm good with it.

625
01:04:40.714 --> 01:04:43.944
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean... ink.


626
01:04:48.223 --> 01:04:50.953
Three days.

627
01:04:55.463 --> 01:04:57.623
- Three days.

628
01:05:05.207 --> 01:05:08.176
- Er, Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye.


629
01:05:08.245 --> 01:05:10.872
I
- I feel sullied and unusual.

630
01:05:10.947 --> 01:05:16.748
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?


631
01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:21.519
Fortunately, he was mum as to
the condition in which these souls need be.


632
01:05:21.591 --> 01:05:22.853
Ah.

633
01:05:22.927 --> 01:05:24.917
Tortuga.

634
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:27.497
Tortuga.

635
01:05:31.468 --> 01:05:35.099
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,


636
01:05:35.173 --> 01:05:38.438
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.


637
01:05:38.511 --> 01:05:42.913
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?


638
01:05:42.982 --> 01:05:47.441
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is
the only free port left in these waters.


639
01:05:47.519 --> 01:05:50.147
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.


640
01:05:50.223 --> 01:05:55.685
An honest sailor is what I am. I make
my living fair and I sleep well each night.


641
01:05:56.396 --> 01:05:58.295
S- sir!

642
01:06:21.622 --> 01:06:24.149
She wants you
to do something.


643
01:06:27.263 --> 01:06:29.925
She's trying to give a sign.

644
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:35.493
Whoa!

645
01:06:38.308 --> 01:06:40.799
Over there! Look for a sign!

646
01:06:45.582 --> 01:06:47.778
Look, there! There it is!

647
01:06:48.218 --> 01:06:50.813
- There's the sign!
- That's seaweed.


648
01:06:50.889 --> 01:06:53.983
- Seaweed can be a sign.
- Looks like entrails.


649
01:06:54.058 --> 01:06:59.155
- That would be a bad sign.
- What's that over there?


650
01:07:17.452 --> 01:07:20.682
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?


651
01:07:20.755 --> 01:07:22.985
I've never sailed a day in me life.

652
01:07:23.056 --> 01:07:26.253
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.


653
01:07:26.327 --> 01:07:29.763
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next!


654
01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:32.492
My wife ran off with my dog

655
01:07:32.934 --> 01:07:35.426
and I'm drunk for a month

656
01:07:35.503 --> 01:07:37.597
and I don't give an ass rat's

657
01:07:37.673 --> 01:07:39.640
if I live or die.

658
01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:42.734
- Perfect. Next!
- I know what I want. I know what I want...


659
01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:46.941
- Me have one arm and a bum leg.
- It's the crow's nest for you.


660
01:07:47.015 --> 01:07:49.211
- I know what I want.
- Next!


661
01:07:49.284 --> 01:07:54.917
Ever since I was a little lad, I've always
wanted to sail the seas... forever.


662
01:07:54.992 --> 01:07:57.721
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.


663
01:07:57.794 --> 01:08:00.092
Thanks very much.

664
01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:05.329
- How we going?
- Including those four, that gives us... four.


665
01:08:08.773 --> 01:08:11.003
And what's your story?

666
01:08:11.075 --> 01:08:13.566
My story.

667
01:08:13.644 --> 01:08:18.742
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.


668
01:08:18.817 --> 01:08:22.447
I chased a man
across the seven seas.


669
01:08:22.521 --> 01:08:25.388
The pursuit cost me my crew,

670
01:08:25.459 --> 01:08:28.119
my commission,

671
01:08:28.194 --> 01:08:30.355
and my life.

672
01:08:35.401 --> 01:08:40.235
- Commodore?
- No, not anymore. Weren't you listening?


673
01:08:43.243 --> 01:08:45.803
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

674
01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:51.109
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.


675
01:08:51.184 --> 01:08:52.619
Lord.

676
01:08:52.687 --> 01:08:54.711
You didn't try to sail through it?

677
01:08:54.790 --> 01:08:57.349
So, do I make your crew

678
01:08:57.424 --> 01:08:59.416
or not?

679
01:09:00.228 --> 01:09:03.026
You haven't said where you're going.

680
01:09:03.097 --> 01:09:05.157
Somewhere nice?!

681
01:09:06.201 --> 01:09:08.636
So, am I worthy to serve

682
01:09:08.704 --> 01:09:11.502
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

683
01:09:13.977 --> 01:09:17.378
Or should I just kill you now?

684
01:09:23.487 --> 01:09:25.681
You're hired.

685
01:09:25.755 --> 01:09:29.749
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

686
01:09:29.827 --> 01:09:33.388
- Easy, sailor!
- That's our captain you're threatening.


687
01:09:46.577 --> 01:09:48.569
- Time to go.
- Aye!


688
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:36.288
- Thanks, mate.
- Aargh!


689
01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:42.838
Carry on.

690
01:10:50.146 --> 01:10:52.707
Come on, then! 
Who wants some?

691
01:10:52.783 --> 01:10:56.310
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.


692
01:10:56.387 --> 01:10:58.720
Come on, who's first?

693
01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:04.851
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.


694
01:11:31.526 --> 01:11:34.221
James Norrington.

695
01:11:35.096 --> 01:11:38.190
What has the world done to you?

696
01:12:06.329 --> 01:12:08.593
Heave!

697
01:12:08.831 --> 01:12:11.026
Heave!

698
01:12:11.735 --> 01:12:13.728
Heave!

699
01:12:13.971 --> 01:12:15.873
Heave!

700
01:12:16.941 --> 01:12:20.378
- Heave!
- Heave!


701
01:12:23.314 --> 01:12:27.308
Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner!

702
01:12:30.322 --> 01:12:32.482
Set to it!

703
01:12:37.762 --> 01:12:40.665
- Step aside.
- Hey! Mind yourself!


704
01:12:41.101 --> 01:12:43.500
Let go, boy!

705
01:12:46.139 --> 01:12:48.300
No.

706
01:12:56.285 --> 01:12:58.912
Haul that weevil to his feet.

707
01:13:04.525 --> 01:13:07.984
Five lashes will remind you
to stay on 'em!


708
01:13:08.064 --> 01:13:13.160
- No!
- Impeding me in my duties?


709
01:13:13.235 --> 01:13:17.070
- You'll share the punishment.
- I'll take it all.


710
01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:19.539
Will you, now?

711
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:24.843
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?


712
01:13:28.551 --> 01:13:30.519
My son.

713
01:13:35.427 --> 01:13:37.760
He's my son.

714
01:13:49.007 --> 01:13:52.306
What fortuitous circumstance be this?

715
01:13:52.377 --> 01:13:56.280
Five lashes be owed, 
I believe it is.

716
01:14:01.187 --> 01:14:03.678
No. No, I won't!

717
01:14:03.758 --> 01:14:06.554
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.

718
01:14:06.993 --> 01:14:12.434
Your issue will feel its sting,
be it by the bosun's hand or your own.


719
01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:18.671
No.

720
01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:20.731
- Bosun!
- No!


721
01:15:04.956 --> 01:15:08.414
You had it easy, boy!

722
01:15:08.493 --> 01:15:11.428
- Will.
- I don't need your help.


723
01:15:13.199 --> 01:15:19.536
The bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh
from bone, with every swing.


724
01:15:19.605 --> 01:15:24.565
So I'm to understand
what you did was an act of compassion?


725
01:15:24.644 --> 01:15:26.771
Yes.

726
01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:38.625
100 years before the mast,
losing who you were, bit by bit,


727
01:15:38.692 --> 01:15:42.560
until you end up...
end up like poor Wyvern here.


728
01:15:44.365 --> 01:15:48.427
Once you've sworn an oath
to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.


729
01:15:48.504 --> 01:15:51.631
Not until your debt is paid.

730
01:15:51.706 --> 01:15:54.175
I've sworn no oath.

731
01:15:55.845 --> 01:15:58.039
You must get away.

732
01:15:59.081 --> 01:16:01.208
Not until I find this.

733
01:16:02.852 --> 01:16:04.752
The key.

734
01:16:11.962 --> 01:16:14.363
The dead man's chest.

735
01:16:15.533 --> 01:16:17.661
What do you know of this?

736
01:16:17.735 --> 01:16:22.467
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...


737
01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:25.669
No, don't stab the heart.

738
01:16:25.743 --> 01:16:30.842
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,


739
01:16:30.916 --> 01:16:35.216
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.


740
01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:38.182
So the captain has the key?

741
01:16:39.425 --> 01:16:42.189
- Where is the key?
- Hidden.


742
01:16:42.595 --> 01:16:45.359
- Where is the chest?
- Hidden.


743
01:16:48.536 --> 01:16:50.367
Captain Sparrow!

744
01:16:50.437 --> 01:16:52.905
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.


745
01:16:52.972 --> 01:16:55.634
I'm here to find the man I love.

746
01:16:56.643 --> 01:17:01.207
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.


747
01:17:02.315 --> 01:17:06.480
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.


748
01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:07.920
Elizabeth.

749
01:17:07.989 --> 01:17:10.423
Hide the rum.

750
01:17:10.491 --> 01:17:13.427
These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.


751
01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:16.556
- I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
- Jack.


752
01:17:18.801 --> 01:17:22.032
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?


753
01:17:22.106 --> 01:17:25.666
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but...


754
01:17:25.741 --> 01:17:32.671
through unfortunate circumstances
that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,


755
01:17:32.749 --> 01:17:37.448
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones's crew.


756
01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:40.424
Davy Jones?

757
01:17:41.893 --> 01:17:44.225
Oh, please.

758
01:17:45.329 --> 01:17:47.798
The captain of the Flying Dutchman?

759
01:17:47.866 --> 01:17:51.268
- You look awful. What are you doing here?
- You hired me.


760
01:17:51.336 --> 01:17:53.600
I can't help it
if your standards are lax.

761
01:17:53.671 --> 01:17:56.573
- You smell funny.
- Jack!


762
01:17:57.009 --> 01:17:59.773
All I want is to find Will.

763
01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:07.610
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?


764
01:18:08.555 --> 01:18:10.921
Of course.

765
01:18:10.991 --> 01:18:15.257
Because I would think you'd want to find
a way to save Will most.


766
01:18:15.897 --> 01:18:19.765
- And you'd have a way of doing that?
- Well...


767
01:18:19.834 --> 01:18:23.100
- there is a chest.
- Oh, dear.


768
01:18:23.171 --> 01:18:25.502
A chest of unknown size and origin.

769
01:18:25.574 --> 01:18:30.509
What contains
the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.


770
01:18:31.914 --> 01:18:33.779
And whoever possesses that chest

771
01:18:33.850 --> 01:18:37.841
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,


772
01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:42.857
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.


773
01:18:42.926 --> 01:18:46.486
You don't actually believe him, do you?

774
01:18:51.233 --> 01:18:53.567
How would we find it?

775
01:18:55.738 --> 01:18:57.605
With this.

776
01:18:57.674 --> 01:19:00.576
My compass... is unique.

777
01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:04.342
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken. "


778
01:19:05.349 --> 01:19:09.787
True enough,
this compass does not point north.


779
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:14.823
Where does it point?

780
01:19:14.893 --> 01:19:19.729
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.


781
01:19:22.367 --> 01:19:24.359
Oh, Jack.

782
01:19:26.372 --> 01:19:30.139
- Are you telling the truth?
- Every word, love.


783
01:19:30.209 --> 01:19:32.678
And what you want most in this world

784
01:19:33.546 --> 01:19:38.484
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?


785
01:19:38.551 --> 01:19:43.490
- To save Will.
- By finding the chest of Davy Jones.


786
01:19:59.262 --> 01:20:01.630
- Mr. Gibbs!
- Cap'n.


787
01:20:01.699 --> 01:20:03.963
- We have our heading.
- Finally!


788
01:20:04.036 --> 01:20:08.633
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!


789
01:20:08.707 --> 01:20:11.973
- Miss Swann.

790
01:20:12.944 --> 01:20:16.381
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.


791
01:20:22.989 --> 01:20:27.892
There's something to knowing the exact
shape of the world and one's place in it.


792
01:20:27.962 --> 01:20:30.659
I assure you, these are not necessary.

793
01:20:30.730 --> 01:20:35.225
I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.


794
01:20:35.303 --> 01:20:38.796
- You have news of her?
- Most recently seen on Tortuga,


795
01:20:38.873 --> 01:20:42.866
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,


796
01:20:42.943 --> 01:20:45.880
and other fugitives from justice.

797
01:20:45.947 --> 01:20:47.812
"Justice"? Hardly.

798
01:20:47.883 --> 01:20:53.652
Including the previous owner of this sword,
I believe.
