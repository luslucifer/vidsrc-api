he grew angry and vengeful.

He became Magneto.

Save the girl?

00:56:20.598 --> 00:56:25.126
You'll have to kill me, Charles.
And what will that accomplish?

Who the hell do you think you are?
You're a mutant.

The whole world out there is full

- At least I've chosen a side.


493
00:59:14.878 --> 00:59:18.506
I'm looking
for Dr. Jean Grey.

495
00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:32.026
I'm Professor Charles Xavier.

496

Not all of us.

505
01:01:13.033 --> 01:01:17.197
The machine emits radiation that triggers
mutation in ordinary human beings.


506
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:19.363
But the mutation is unnatural.

507
01:01:19.439 --> 01:01:22.067
Kelly's body is rejecting it.
His cells began...


508
01:01:22.142 --> 01:01:24.475
<i>to break down
almost immediately.</i>


509

- What effect does radiation have on mutants?
- There appears to be none.


510
01:01:27.515 --> 01:01:31.349
But I fear it will seriously
harm any normal person exposed to it.


511
01:01:31.419 --> 01:01:35.320
- So what does Magneto want with Rogue?
- I don't know.

<i>[Cyclops]
Wait a second.</i>

You said this machine
draws its power from Magneto...


514
01:01:42.863 --> 01:01:45.661
<i>- and that it weakened him.
- [Xavier] Yes.</i>


515
01:01:46.968 --> 01:01:49.061
In fact, it nearly killed him.

516
01:01:49.136 --> 01:01:51.798
He's gonna transfer
his power to Rogue...


517
01:01:51.873 --> 01:01:55.070
<i>and use her
to power the machine.</i>

<i>- Yes.</i>

I'm sorry, Professor, but he'll
