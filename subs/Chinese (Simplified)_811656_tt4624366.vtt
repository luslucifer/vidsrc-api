00:12:50.873 --> 00:12:52.174
妈妈 外面...
Mom there's a...


152
00:12:52.207 --> 00:12:53.175
我窗户外面有个怪物
There's a monster outside my window.


153
00:12:53.208 --> 00:12:54.443
亲爱的
No, honey.


154
00:12:54.543 --> 00:12:55.587
你只是做噩梦了
You're just having a bad dream.


155
00:12:55.611 --> 00:12:58.413
不是 你看！
No, look, look, look, look!


156
00:12:58.513 --> 00:12:59.615
好好好
Okay, okay.


157
00:12:59.715 --> 00:13:01.216
我看看
Let's see.


158
00:13:01.283 --> 00:13:03.552
没有 没有怪物
No, no monsters out here.


159
00:13:03.619 --> 00:13:05.287
不过起风暴了
There was a storm out there, though.


160
00:13:05.387 --> 00:13:08.557
可能是这个声音吓到你了吧？
So maybe that's what scared you, huh?


161
00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:13.261
我理解 我也做噩梦了
I know, I was having a bad dream too.


162
00:13:14.463 --> 00:13:15.731
梦里也有怪物吗？
Was there a monster in it?


163
00:13:15.764 --> 00:13:18.800
对 而且非常可怕
Yes, and it was very scary.


164
00:13:20.302 --> 00:13:23.205
但我知道我们两个
But I know that you and I


165
00:13:23.238 --> 00:13:25.240
绝对安全
are completely safe,


166
00:13:25.273 --> 00:13:27.609
就像窝在毯子里的两只小虫子
like two bugs, snug in a rug.


167
00:13:29.645 --> 00:13:30.746
好吗？
Okay?


168
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:33.382
睡吧 宝贝
Get some rest, babe.


169
00:13:34.083 --> 00:13:35.283
明天还要上学呢
You got school tomorrow.


170
00:13:35.384 --> 00:13:37.086
我不想上学
I don't want to go to school.


171
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.787
但是你必须去
Well, you have to,


172
00:13:38.888 --> 00:13:41.124
这是妈妈说的
Mommy says.


173
00:13:41.223 --> 00:13:43.092
来吧 躺下
Come on, lie down.


174
00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:44.426
躺下
Lay down.


175
00:13:44.493 --> 00:13:46.561
睡吧
Get some sleep.


176
00:13:51.667 --> 00:13:52.667
妈妈
Mom,


177
00:13:53.602 --> 00:13:56.105
能别关门吗？
can you leave the door open?


178
00:13:56.171 --> 00:13:58.908
当然了
Of course.


179
00:14:11.787 --> 00:14:13.923
韦弗医生办公室 请问有什么可以帮您的？
Dr. Weaver's office. How may I help you?


180
00:14:13.956 --> 00:14:15.992
能让韦弗医生接电话吗？
May I speak to Dr. Weaver please?


181
00:14:16.092 --> 00:14:18.427
对不起 女士 这只是他的电话应答服务
I'm sorry, ma'am, this is just his answering service.


182
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.097
您想给他留言吗？
Would you like to leave a message?


183
00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.466
不用了 谢谢
No, thank you.


184
00:14:34.877 --> 00:14:38.213
? I don't want
to set the world ?

185
00:14:38.313 --> 00:14:39.648
科迪 快点
Cody, hurry up.


186
00:14:39.681 --> 00:14:41.984
第一天上学可不能迟到
You don't want to be late your first day.


187
00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:49.158
? I just want to start ?

188
00:14:49.192 --> 00:14:52.694
? A flame in your heart ?

189
00:14:57.066 --> 00:14:59.168
好了 上学第一天
Okay, first day of school.


190
00:14:59.234 --> 00:15:01.170
有个小窍门
Here's a little tool.


191
00:15:01.204 --> 00:15:03.305
牢记黄金法则
Practice the golden rule


192
00:15:03.338 --> 00:15:05.507
你就能变酷
and you will be Mr. Cool.


193
00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.176
我爱你
I love you.


194
00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:09.377
祝你过得愉快
Have a great day, okay?


195
00:15:11.546 --> 00:15:14.083
? No other... ?

196
00:15:26.195 --> 00:15:28.430
? I lost all ambition ?

197
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.732
? For worldly acclaim ?

198
00:15:30.833 --> 00:15:36.038
? I just want to
be the one you love ?

199
00:15:36.705 --> 00:15:39.441
? And with your admission ?

200
00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:42.111
? That you feel the same ?

201
00:15:42.211 --> 00:15:46.215
? I'll have reached the
goal I'm dreaming of ?

202
00:15:46.249 --> 00:15:47.917
? Believe me ?

203
00:15:48.017 --> 00:15:54.723
? I don't want to
set the world on fire ?

204
00:15:57.459 --> 00:16:02.564
? I just want to start ?

205
00:16:02.597 --> 00:16:06.068
? A flame in your heart ?

206
00:16:22.051 --> 00:16:23.485
这是你的办公桌
This is your desk.


207
00:16:23.585 --> 00:16:25.087
放轻松点
Make yourself comfortable.


208
00:16:26.788 --> 00:16:29.391
我去拿些材料 然后就可以开始了
I'll go get some materials and be back and get started.


209
00:16:29.424 --> 00:16:31.093
好的 谢谢
Okay, thank you.


210
00:16:33.262 --> 00:16:34.096

00:16:36.565 --> 00:16:37.766

214
00:16:37.799 --> 00:16:39.501
很高兴认识你 简
It's very nice to meet you, Jane.


215
00:16:39.601 --> 00:16:41.336
你这身衣服是从哪来的？
Where'd you get that dress?


216
00:16:41.436 --> 00:16:42.637
这个？
Oh, this?


217
00:16:42.737 --> 00:16:44.573
我...
I...


218
00:16:45.174 --> 00:16:46.641
我是简
This is Jane.


219
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:49.477
好的 先生 马上
Yes, sir. Right away.


220
00:17:12.935 --> 00:17:14.303
嘿 第一天过得怎么样？
Hey, how was your first day?


221
00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:16.305
还行
It was okay.


222
00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.007
有没有交到新朋友？
Did you make any new friends?


223
00:17:19.976 --> 00:17:20.943
没有
No.


224
00:17:20.977 --> 00:17:23.980
肯定很快就能交到的
Well, I'm sure you will in no time.


225
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.449
我们回家
All right, here we go home.


226
00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.905
我新工作的第一天很愉快
Well, I had a great first day at work.


227
00:17:49.005 --> 00:17:51.340
那里的女士们都很好
The ladies, they're so nice,


228
00:17:51.374 --> 00:17:54.409
凯西和…呃…
Kathy and, um...


229
00:17:54.509 --> 00:17:55.912
苏珊
Susan.


230
00:17:56.012 --> 00:17:59.015
我跟她们相处得都特别愉快
Well, I just got such a tickle out of all of them.


231
00:18:00.383 --> 00:18:01.918
科迪 快吃呀
Cody, eat your dinner.


232
00:18:03.152 --> 00:18:04.353
我不饿
I'm not hungry.


233
00:18:04.419 --> 00:18:06.421
那就少吃一点
Well, try to eat a little.


234
00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:26.608
巨魔是最大公山羊的两倍大
The troll was twice as big as the biggest Billy goat gruff,


235
00:18:26.708 --> 00:18:28.610
但是公山羊并不害怕
but the Billy goat was not afraid.


236
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:31.847
他低下头 把角对准巨魔冲了过去
He lowered his horns and ran at the troll,


237
00:18:31.881 --> 00:18:34.383
把他推下桥
pushing him over the bridge.


238
00:18:34.417 --> 00:18:36.352
巨魔愤怒地尖叫着
The troll screamed with fury


239
00:18:36.385 --> 00:18:38.054
他掉进了河里
as he fell into the water


240
00:18:38.087 --> 00:18:40.256
被水流冲走了
and was swept away by the current.


241
00:18:41.223 --> 00:18:43.692
然后 最大的公山羊
Then, the biggest Billy goat gruff


242
00:18:43.725 --> 00:18:45.560
回到草地上跟家人团聚了
joined his family in the meadow


243
00:18:45.593 --> 00:18:47.595
并且告诉他们
and told them they never to worry


244
00:18:47.696 --> 00:18:49.932
以后过桥再也不用担心了
about crossing the bridge again.


245
00:18:50.032 --> 00:18:51.067
结束了
The end.


246
00:18:51.133 --> 00:18:53.069
再读一个故事
Read another one.


247
00:18:53.135 --> 00:18:54.236
不行
Sorry.


248
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:55.603
时间到了
The time has come


249
00:18:55.704 --> 00:18:58.274
小男孩该数羊睡觉了
for counting sheep for little boys who need their sleep.


250
00:19:00.809 --> 00:19:01.809
躺下吧
Now lie down.


251
00:19:01.877 --> 00:19:03.412
明天还要上学
You've got school tomorrow.


252
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.613
睡觉吧
Got to get some rest.


253
00:19:06.548 --> 00:19:07.917
晚安 可爱的小王子
Goodnight, sweet prince.


254
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:17.426
别关门 好吗？
Leave the door open, okay?


255
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.128
好的
Okay.


256
00:19:19.228 --> 00:19:20.396
爱你
Love you.


257
00:19:20.429 --> 00:19:21.464
你好 是贝蒂吗？
Hello, Betty?


258
00:19:21.563 --> 00:19:22.731

259
00:19:22.764 --> 00:19:23.833
是我 你是哪位？
Yes, who's this?


260
00:19:23.933 --> 00:19:24.900
里克·尼尔森
This is Rick Nelson.


261
00:19:24.934 --> 00:19:26.068
哦 大卫的弟弟？
Oh, David's brother?


262
00:19:26.102 --> 00:19:27.602
是的
Yeah.


263
00:19:28.803 --> 00:19:30.106
你想让我周五几点
Say, what time do you want me


264
00:19:30.172 --> 00:19:31.749
来接你去参加舞会？
to pick you up for the dance Friday night?


265
00:19:31.773 --> 00:19:32.951
八点半就很合适
Oh, well, 8:30 would just be wonderful.


266
00:19:32.975 --> 00:19:34.477
嘿 我找到她了
Hey, I found her.


267
00:19:34.576 --> 00:19:36.711
好的 我八点半准时到
Okay, I'll be there at 8:30...


268
00:19:36.811 --> 00:19:39.281
-喂 -劳拉？
- Hello? - Laura?


269
00:19:40.582 --> 00:19:41.984
我本来以为我自己在用的
I thought my own


270
00:19:42.084 --> 00:19:43.685
热点洗碗机已经很惊艳了
Hotpoint dishwasher was wonderful,


271
00:19:43.785 --> 00:19:46.122
但是这个新洗碗机才是最棒的
but this new one is the greatest ever...


272
00:19:46.155 --> 00:19:49.458
它采用了全新的无水渍系统
It uses a new system of spotless cleansing,


273
00:19:49.492 --> 00:19:51.127
两遍洗涤剂清洗
two detergent washes


274
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.463
再加上第二遍漂洗的时候
and a few drops of this special wetting agent


275
00:19:54.529 --> 00:19:56.132
自动滴入的…
squirted automatically.


276
00:20:50.152 --> 00:20:51.253
喂
Hello?


277
00:20:51.353 --> 00:20:52.221
劳拉
Laura.


278
00:20:52.321 --> 00:20:53.422
妈妈
Mother.


279
00:20:53.522 --> 00:20:54.900
妈妈 你怎么能把我的号码告诉斯科特？
Mother, how could you give Scott my number?


280
00:20:54.924 --> 00:20:56.058
科迪
Cody.


281
00:20:56.158 --> 00:20:57.235
劳拉 你去哪儿了？
Laura, where have you been?


282
00:20:57.259 --> 00:20:58.693
他刚给我打了电话
He just called here.


283
00:20:58.726 --> 00:21:00.396
你怎么能这样？
How could you do that?


284
00:21:00.496 --> 00:21:01.864
我没告诉他你的号码
I didn't give him your number.


285
00:21:01.931 --> 00:21:03.475
只告诉了你的几个好朋友
I only gave it to a few of your friends.


286
00:21:03.499 --> 00:21:04.533
为什么？
Why?


287
00:21:04.599 --> 00:21:05.767
你为什么要这样？
Why would you do that?


288
00:21:05.868 --> 00:21:08.270
我跟你说过 不要告诉任何人
I told you not to give it to anyone.


289
00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:09.604
他们是你的朋友啊
They're your friends.


290
00:21:09.704 --> 00:21:11.340
你把我的地址也告诉他了吗？
Did you give him my address too?


291
00:21:11.373 --> 00:21:12.541
他会找上门来吗？
Is he gonna come here?


292
00:21:12.607 --> 00:21:13.985
他不会过去的 劳拉
He's not going to come there, Laura.


293
00:21:14.009 --> 00:21:15.677
他只想和你谈谈
He just wants to talk to you.


294
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:16.912
他很后悔
He feels so bad.


295
00:21:16.946 --> 00:21:19.248
我不在乎他怎么想
I don't care how he feels.


296
00:21:19.348 --> 00:21:21.884
你知道他做了那种事
I don't know how you can even speak to him


297
00:21:21.917 --> 00:21:23.085
你怎么还能跟他说话？
after what he did.


298
00:21:23.185 --> 00:21:26.388
你应该站在我们这边
You're supposed to be on our side.


299
00:21:26.455 --> 00:21:28.224
外婆就会支持我们
Grandma would be.


300
00:21:28.257 --> 00:21:30.459
我们当然支持你了 劳拉
Of course we're on your side, Laura.


301
00:21:30.559 --> 00:21:31.861
你没有
No you're not.


302
00:21:31.894 --> 00:21:34.063
亲爱的 我去陪你们住几天好吗？
Honey, why don't I come and stay with you for a while?


303
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.065
不用
No. No.


304
00:21:36.132 --> 00:21:37.933
我不需要任何帮助 一切都很好
I don't need any help. Everything's perfect.


305
00:21:59.421 --> 00:22:01.423
妈妈！
Mom!


306
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:02.091
科迪
Cody.


307
00:22:02.158 --> 00:22:03.325
科迪 怎么了？
Cody, what's wrong?


308
00:22:03.425 --> 00:22:04.659
我的房间里有怪物
There was a monster in my room.


309
00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:06.595
没事的
It's okay. It's okay.


310
00:22:06.661 --> 00:22:08.164
你没事的
You're okay.


311
00:22:08.264 --> 00:22:09.908
妈妈 池塘里的怪物在我房间里！
Mom, the monster from the pond was in my room!


312
00:22:09.932 --> 00:22:11.901
亲爱的 没有怪物
Honey, there's no monster.


313
00:22:11.934 --> 00:22:13.302
你只是做噩梦了
You're just having a bad dream.


314
00:22:13.402 --> 00:22:14.442
你不听我说话
You're not listening to me.


315
00:22:14.503 --> 00:22:15.938
它就在这里
It was right here.


316
00:22:16.005 --> 00:22:17.125
梦很像真的
It doesn't feel like a dream,


317
00:22:17.173 --> 00:22:19.608
我知道 但我保证那只是梦
I know, but it was, I promise.


318
00:22:19.642 --> 00:22:20.976
怪物就在这里
The monster was here.


319
00:23:41.857 --> 00:23:44.727
当我渴望回到你身边时
As I yearn to return to you,


320
00:23:44.827 --> 00:23:48.030
你也会渴望回到我身边
so will you yearn to return to me.


321
00:23:49.398 --> 00:23:51.600
当我们的道路再次交汇
When our paths do cross again,


322
00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.103
我们的心也会欣喜地再次交织
our hearts will entwined with ecstasy.


323
00:24:00.775 --> 00:24:02.044
劳拉
Laura,


324
00:24:02.077 --> 00:24:04.513
我还以为你是塞顿夫人的鬼魂呢
I thought you were Mrs. Seton's ghost.


325
00:24:04.546 --> 00:24:05.948
不是 外婆
No, Grandma.


326
00:24:06.048 --> 00:24:07.549
她不喜欢阁楼里
She doesn't like it in the attic.


327
00:24:07.583 --> 00:24:09.752
我只在地下室见过她
I only ever see her in the basement.


328
00:24:09.852 --> 00:24:11.553
我也是
Me too.


329
00:24:11.587 --> 00:24:14.256
你从哪找到这么老的东西？
Where did you find this old thing?


330
00:24:17.526 --> 00:24:19.561
他值得你这么付出吗？
Ugh. Is he really worth the effort?


331
00:24:20.929 --> 00:24:23.399
亲爱的 别哭
Oh, honey, don't cry.


332
00:24:23.432 --> 00:24:27.136
现在的年轻人一定很难吧
I can't even imagine how hard it is to be young these days.


333
00:24:27.236 --> 00:24:29.405
我年轻那时候要简单得多
It was so much simpler back in my time.


334
00:24:29.438 --> 00:24:31.974
真希望能带你一起回到过去
I wish I could take you back there with me.


335
00:24:32.908 --> 00:24:34.209
我也希望
I wish I could too.


336
00:24:35.044 --> 00:24:36.312
你很适合那个时代
You'd fit right in.


337
00:24:37.913 --> 00:24:39.581
谢谢 外婆
Thanks, Grandma.


338
00:25:02.604 --> 00:25:04.106
这是韦弗医生的办公室
This is Dr. Weaver's office.


339
00:25:04.173 --> 00:25:05.607
请问有什么可以帮您？
How may I help you?


340
00:25:05.641 --> 00:25:07.076
是弗朗辛吗？
Hi, Francine?


341
00:25:07.109 --> 00:25:08.010
我是劳拉·巴特勒
It's Laura Butler.


342
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.011
嗨 劳拉
Hi, Laura.


343
00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:10.351
我们一直想联系您
We've been trying to reach you.


344
00:25:10.446 --> 00:25:12.448
韦弗医生刚好进来了 稍等
Oh, Dr. Weaver just walked in, hold on.


345
00:25:12.514 --> 00:25:14.917
劳拉 你好吗？
Laura, how are you?


346
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.452
你好 医生
Hi, Doctor.


347
00:25:19.655 --> 00:25:20.823
我也说不好
I don't know.


348
00:25:20.923 --> 00:25:22.291
怎么回事？
What's going on?


349
00:25:24.126 --> 00:25:25.294
斯科特给我打电话了
Scott called.


350
00:25:26.261 --> 00:25:27.529
你又做梦了吗？
Are you having the dreams again?


351
00:25:27.629 --> 00:25:28.832
是的
Yeah.


352
00:25:28.931 --> 00:25:33.035
我不知道是不是该重新服药
I'm wondering if maybe I should go back on medication.


353
00:25:33.135 --> 00:25:36.638
我更希望不用通过药物来处理
You know, I prefer we didn't handle them through medication.


354
00:25:36.705 --> 00:25:38.040
你能今天过来一趟吗？
Can you come in today?


355
00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.175
不行 我不在城里
No, I'm out of town.


356
00:25:40.275 --> 00:25:41.710
你在哪里？
Where are you?


357
00:25:42.611 --> 00:25:43.645
劳拉？
Laura?


358
00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.215
我在听
I'm here.


359
00:25:46.315 --> 00:25:47.816
你在哪里？
Where are you?


360
00:25:49.618 --> 00:25:53.188
我可能是想多了
You know, I think I'm just being silly.


361
00:25:53.288 --> 00:25:55.557
一切都会好起来的
Everything will be fine.


362
00:25:55.657 --> 00:25:58.227
-谢谢你 医生 -劳拉？
- Thank you, Doctor. - Laura?


363
00:26:00.295 --> 00:26:01.831
科迪 快点
Cody, hurry up.


364
00:26:01.865 --> 00:26:03.198
我们要迟到了
We're going to be late.


365
00:26:09.338 --> 00:26:11.673
-下午好 -下午好
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.


366
00:26:12.708 --> 00:26:14.343
有什么需要帮忙的吗？
What can I do for you?


367
00:26:14.376 --> 00:26:16.020
我只是想跟你说一声
Well, I just wanted to let you know that the,


368
00:26:16.044 --> 00:26:18.213
厨房的水龙头漏水
the kitchen sink was leaking.


369
00:26:18.313 --> 00:26:20.082
所以我把水阀关掉了
So I turned off the water.


370
00:26:20.182 --> 00:26:23.152
可能需要换个新胶圈
Probably just need your new seed washer.


371
00:26:23.185 --> 00:26:25.821
我会去看看的
I'll come by and take a look.


372
00:26:25.855 --> 00:26:27.089
谢谢
Thank you.


373
00:26:27.189 --> 00:26:31.560
而且电视也有问题了
And also the television sort of popped


374
00:26:32.761 --> 00:26:34.229
现在没法看了
and now it's not working.


375
00:26:34.329 --> 00:26:36.365
我们不管电视的事
We're not responsible for the television.


376
00:26:36.432 --> 00:26:39.201
好了 莱诺拉 我会过去看看的
Well, now, Lenora, I'd go by and take a look at it.


377
00:26:39.234 --> 00:26:42.037
但是她得支付零件费用
Well, but she's going to have to pay for the parts


378
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.840
电视是上任租客留下的
and the television was left behind.


379
00:26:43.873 --> 00:26:45.040
不是我们的房子提供的
It's not part of the house.


380
00:26:45.107 --> 00:26:46.375
可以的
That's okay.


381
00:26:46.442 --> 00:26:48.912
你先帮我看看吧
If you wouldn't mind just taking a look.


382
00:26:49.011 --> 00:26:50.045
没问题
Will do.


383
00:26:50.078 --> 00:26:51.246
那好
Okay.


384
00:26:51.313 --> 00:26:52.448
祝你们一天愉快
Well, have a nice day.


385
00:26:52.548 --> 00:26:54.416
你也是 小姑娘
You as well, young lady.


386
00:26:57.887 --> 00:26:59.221
我本来以为我自己在用的
That's how it starts.


387
00:27:00.055 --> 00:27:03.559
热点洗碗机已经很惊艳了
I thought my own Hotpoint dishwasher was wonderful,


388
00:27:03.592 --> 00:27:05.727
但是这个新洗碗机才是最棒的
but this new one is the greatest ever.


389
00:27:05.761 --> 00:27:08.230
它采用了全新的无水渍系统
It uses a new system of spotless cleanser,


390
00:27:08.297 --> 00:27:09.899
两遍洗涤剂清洗
two detergent washes,


391
00:27:09.965 --> 00:27:12.568
再加上第二遍漂洗的时候
plus a few drops of this special wetting agent


392
00:27:12.601 --> 00:27:14.938
自动滴入的特殊湿润剂
squirted automatically in the second rinse water.


393
00:27:15.037 --> 00:27:16.438
你知道结果是什么吗？
And do you know what this does?


394
00:27:16.538 --> 00:27:19.808
让水不可能残留在餐具上
It makes it impossible for water to collect in drops


395
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:20.944
或者沿着餐具滑落
on your dishes.


396
00:27:21.043 --> 00:27:22.478
即使是玻璃餐具和银器
You get spotless dry,


397
00:27:22.578 --> 00:27:24.613
也不会有任何水渍
even on glasses and silver.


398
00:27:24.646 --> 00:27:26.582
在热点洗碗机中
Everything is sparkling clean


399
00:27:26.615 --> 00:27:28.750
一切都会洗得闪闪发光
when it's washed in a Hotpoint.


400
00:27:34.823 --> 00:27:36.258
科迪
Cody.


401
00:27:51.908 --> 00:27:54.443
请查询号码簿的分类页面
Turn to the classified pages of your phone book.


402
00:27:54.476 --> 00:27:56.078
你能找到距离最近的
That's where you will find


403
00:27:56.111 --> 00:27:58.580
热点经销商
your nearest Hotpoint dealer.


404
00:28:31.346 --> 00:28:32.514
冰箱
Refrigerators,


405
00:28:32.614 --> 00:28:34.683
自动洗衣机和...
automatic washers and...


406
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160
科迪！
Cody!


407
00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:08.430
科迪！
Cody!


408
00:32:11.566 --> 00:32:13.602
我想回家
I want to go home.


409
00:32:21.844 --> 00:32:22.544
安泊尔
Amber.


410
00:32:22.611 --> 00:32:24.046
这是你做的？
Is this you?


411
00:32:24.113 --> 00:32:25.113
是你做的？
You did this?


412
00:32:25.181 --> 00:32:26.448
你确定吗？
Are you sure?


413
00:32:38.593 --> 00:32:41.296
我在想是不是你来我家处理事情
So I thought maybe you had come by the house for something.


414
00:32:41.396 --> 00:32:43.298
没有 可能是浣熊吧
No, no, probably a raccoon.


415
00:32:43.398 --> 00:32:45.400
它们哪里都能钻进去
They climb all over the place.


416
00:32:45.467 --> 00:32:47.536
太讨厌了
Bunch of pests.


417
00:32:47.569 --> 00:32:50.106
我觉得不是浣熊
No, I don't think this was a raccoon.


418
00:32:50.206 --> 00:32:53.441
我儿子说他在池塘边看到了一些东西
My son said that he saw something down by the pond.


419
00:32:53.542 --> 00:32:54.944
他不该去池塘那里
He's not supposed to be at the pond.


420
00:32:55.044 --> 00:32:56.444
我不想让他去那里玩
I don't want him playing near there.


421
00:32:56.545 --> 00:32:58.147
我知道 我已经…
Yes, I know. I have, uh,


422
00:32:58.247 --> 00:32:59.949
我已经告诉他不要过去了
I've already told him to stay away from it.


423
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:01.583
我可以设一些捉浣熊的陷阱
I can set some traps from the raccoons.


424
00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.087
我真的认为不是浣熊
Again, I really don't think it was a raccoon.


425
00:33:05.121 --> 00:33:07.656
所以陷阱应该没用
So I don't think that that would be helpful.


426
00:33:07.756 --> 00:33:11.994
我昨晚出去查看的时候
Oh, but I did manage to lock myself out


427
00:33:12.094 --> 00:33:14.429
把自己锁在了房子外面…
of the house last night when I went to investigate and...


428
00:33:14.496 --> 00:33:15.932
等等 这不可能
Wait, that's impossible.


429
00:33:15.965 --> 00:33:17.632
门不会自己锁住...
The door doesn't lock on its own...


430
00:33:17.732 --> 00:33:18.944
那就是卡住了
Well, then I guess it was stuck.


431
00:33:18.968 --> 00:33:20.303
-你必须... -总之呢
- Well you need... - Anyway.


432
00:33:20.402 --> 00:33:23.272
我只好打破门上的窗户爬进去
I had to break the window on the door to get in.


433
00:33:23.338 --> 00:33:25.241
所以我很抱歉
So I'm so sorry.


434
00:33:25.274 --> 00:33:26.314
我们已经修好了水龙头
We already fixed the sink.


435
00:33:26.341 --> 00:33:27.585
不会再付钱修窗户了
We're not paying for that window.


436

因为你讨厌爸爸

472
00:35:32.935 --> 00:35:34.636
我不是讨厌爸爸

我是讨厌爸爸对我们做的事

也许有一天我也会原谅他

480
00:35:59.627 --> 00:36:01.263

In the meantime,


481
00:36:01.297 --> 00:36:05.234
我们能试着在这里开心地生活吗？

I thought you said it was a monster in the pond.


488

我本来以为是怪物

00:45:39.909 --> 00:45:41.310
你摔倒了
You fell down.


578
00:45:45.014 --> 00:45:46.983
快走
Come on. Come on.


579
00:45:50.719 --> 00:45:53.422
-妈妈 你在干什么？ -上车
- Mom, what are you doing? - Get in the car.


580
00:45:53.522 --> 00:45:55.591
-为什么？ -快上车
- Why? - Just get in.


581
00:45:55.691 --> 00:45:58.694
-但是 妈妈... -上车！
- But, Mom... - Get in the car!


582
00:46:01.363 --> 00:46:03.198
-我们要去哪？ -只要离开这里 去哪都行
- Where are we going? - Anywhere but here.


583
00:46:03.265 --> 00:46:04.566
为什么？她吓到你了？
But why? Because she scared you?


584
00:46:04.666 --> 00:46:06.002
她不是故意吓唬你的 妈妈
She didn't mean to scare you, Mom.


585
00:46:06.035 --> 00:46:07.070
科迪 闭嘴！
Be quiet, Cody!


586
00:46:07.169 --> 00:46:08.503
你得跟她谈谈 妈妈
You need to talk to her, Mom.


587
00:46:08.537 --> 00:46:09.647
她不会伤害你的 她不会伤害任何人！
She would never hurt you. She wouldn't hurt anyone!


588
00:46:09.671 --> 00:46:11.239
够了 科迪！
Enough, Cody! Enough!


589
00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.708
我不知道那是什么东西
I don't not know what that thing is


590
00:46:12.741 --> 00:46:14.376
但是你永远不许再跟它说话了！
but you are never talking to it again.


591
00:46:14.409 --> 00:46:15.711
明白吗？永远！
Do you understand? Ever!


592
00:46:15.744 --> 00:46:17.013
你要带我回家吗？
Are you gonna take me home?


593
00:46:17.046 --> 00:46:19.414
不 该死的 我说了无数遍了
No, goddammit, for the hundredth time.


594
00:46:19.514 --> 00:46:21.050
我们不回家
We're not going home.


595
00:46:21.116 --> 00:46:22.451
别再提这事了
Stop talking about that.


596
00:46:22.551 --> 00:46:24.219
那我们要去哪？
Then where are we going?


597
00:46:30.359 --> 00:46:31.894
我该怎么办？
What am I supposed to do?


598
00:46:36.632 --> 00:46:39.735
我该怎么办？
What am I supposed to do?


599
00:46:44.373 --> 00:46:45.975
没事的 妈妈
It's okay, Mom.


600
00:46:46.876 --> 00:46:47.877
她走了
She's gone.


601
00:46:49.544 --> 00:46:51.747
我会让她不要再去找你了
I'll tell her not to bother you anymore.


602
00:46:53.382 --> 00:46:54.583
好吗？
Okay?


603
00:46:54.616 --> 00:46:56.618
你该睡觉了 你累了
You should go to bed. You're tired.


604
00:46:57.486 --> 00:47:01.124
我会陪着你的 好吗？
I'll stay with you, okay?


605
00:47:01.223 --> 00:47:03.659
我们会没事的
We'll be all right.


606
00:47:03.759 --> 00:47:05.995
我保证
I promise.


607
00:47:06.095 --> 00:47:07.462
我们会没事的
We're gonna be all right.


608
00:47:38.794 --> 00:47:40.696
你准备好了？
You ready?


609
00:47:42.497 --> 00:47:44.800
我希望你一到学校
Now, I want you to give these out


610
00:47:44.834 --> 00:47:46.969
就把这些都发出去 好吗？
as soon as you get to school, okay?


611
00:47:47.003 --> 00:47:48.370
-好的 -很好
- Okay. - Okay.


612
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:51.007
就放在这里
Put 'em right in here.


613
00:48:06.321 --> 00:48:07.823
你好 接线员
Hello, operator,


614
00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:11.793
请帮我转接圣玛丽教堂吗？
will you connect me with St. Mary's church please?


615
00:48:12.561 --> 00:48:13.395
谢谢
Thank you.


616
00:48:13.495 --> 00:48:14.496
圣玛丽教堂
Saint Mary's.


617
00:48:14.529 --> 00:48:15.998
艾格尼丝修女
Sister Agnes speaking.


618
00:48:16.065 --> 00:48:17.232
你好
Hi.


619
00:48:17.332 --> 00:48:20.002
不知道有没有人
I was wondering if there might be someone available


620
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:22.872
能跟我谈谈？
to speak with me?


621
00:48:22.972 --> 00:48:24.673
我 我想...
I, I think...


622
00:48:25.307 --> 00:48:30.012
我觉得我家里有恶魔之类的东西
I think I have a demon or something in my house.


623
00:48:33.049 --> 00:48:35.852
喂？
Hello?


624
00:48:35.885 --> 00:48:37.753
喂？
Hello?


625
00:49:03.779 --> 00:49:05.214
朗特里先生有空吗？
Is Mr. Langtree available?


626
00:49:05.248 --> 00:49:08.251
怎么了 你又把什么东西弄坏了？
Why, what'd you break this time?


627
00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:10.052
没有
Oh. Nothing, nothing.


628
00:49:10.119 --> 00:49:11.888
我就是 呃…
I just, um...


629
00:49:13.923 --> 00:49:15.958
我不知道该怎么说
I don't, I don't know exactly how to say this.


630
00:49:16.058 --> 00:49:17.927
直说就行了
Well, just say it.


631
00:49:20.395 --> 00:49:21.730
有没有人说过
Has anyone ever said


632
00:49:21.763 --> 00:49:25.902
那座房子有什么不对劲？
that there's something wrong with the house?


633
00:49:26.802 --> 00:49:29.205
你到底想干什么 小姐？
What are you up to, missy?


634
00:49:30.239 --> 00:49:31.606
什么意思？
What do you mean?


635
00:49:31.706 --> 00:49:33.417
因为你搬进那所房子之前
Because you knew exactly what you were getting into


636
00:49:33.441 --> 00:49:34.810
就已经知道房子的状况了
when you moved into the house.


637
00:49:34.911 --> 00:49:37.246
如果你觉得你可以穿着那条小裙子
So if you think that you can come sashaying in here


638
00:49:37.312 --> 00:49:38.981
在这里搞点小动作
in that little skirt


639
00:49:39.081 --> 00:49:41.918
就可以骗我们在那房子上投入一大笔钱
and con us into putting a whole bunch of money into that place,


640
00:49:41.951 --> 00:49:44.086
我丈夫可能会蠢到上你的当
my husband might be stupid enough to fall for that,


641
00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.154
但我不会
but I'm not.


642
00:49:45.254 --> 00:49:46.989
我没想让你们干什么事
I'm not trying to do anything.


643
00:49:47.089 --> 00:49:48.689
那我不明白你来这里干什么
Well, I don't know what you're doing here


644
00:49:48.757 --> 00:49:50.759
除非你在隐瞒什么
in the first place, unless you're hiding something.


645
00:49:50.792 --> 00:49:53.095
我是想问...
I am trying to ask you...


646
00:49:54.596 --> 00:49:57.465
那栋房子里是不是有鬼
if there's a ghost in the house.


647
00:49:57.566 --> 00:49:59.235
鬼？
A ghost!


648
00:49:59.268 --> 00:50:00.435
你吸毒了吗？
Is it drugs?


649
00:50:00.502 --> 00:50:02.404
没有
No, no.


650
00:50:02.437 --> 00:50:04.106
我可是有孩子的人
I have a child.


651
00:50:10.745 --> 00:50:12.681
如果再让我听到
Because if I get wind


652
00:50:12.781 --> 00:50:14.816
那座房子里闹鬼之类的屁话
that any of that crap is going on in that house,


653
00:50:14.917 --> 00:50:16.785
我就要报警了
I'm going to call the police,


654
00:50:16.853 --> 00:50:21.123
到时候警察肯定会把你的孩子带走
and you can be sure of the fact they'll take your child away from you.


655
00:50:36.705 --> 00:50:37.840
? Every day ?

656
00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:39.507
? It's a gettin' closer ?

657
00:50:39.608 --> 00:50:40.618
吹这么多气球干什么？
What are we going to do with all these balloons?


658
00:50:40.642 --> 00:50:41.610
挂起来
Oh, we're going to hang them.


659
00:50:41.643 --> 00:50:43.678
从这里开始
I'm going to hang from here,


660
00:50:43.778 --> 00:50:46.282
沿着这里挂一排
and then along there.


661
00:50:46.315 --> 00:50:47.582
也许那里也挂几个
And maybe over there.


662
00:50:47.682 --> 00:50:48.851
肯定很好看
It's gonna look great.


663
00:50:48.951 --> 00:50:50.286
所有人都会喜欢的
Everyone's gonna love it.


664
00:50:50.319 --> 00:50:51.553
? Hey, hey, hey ?

665
00:50:51.653 --> 00:50:53.722
? Everyday, it's a getting faster ?

666
00:50:53.822 --> 00:50:54.623
? Everyone ?

667
00:50:54.656 --> 00:50:56.458
听起来像放屁
It sounds like I farted.


668
00:50:56.491 --> 00:50:57.827
你也试试 妈妈
You do it, Mom.


669
00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.527
? Love like yours ?

670
00:50:59.628 --> 00:51:02.564
? Will surely come my way ?

671
00:51:02.664 --> 00:51:04.333
? Hey, hey, hey ?

672
00:51:04.367 --> 00:51:05.567
是谁在切奶酪？
Who cut the cheese?


673
00:51:05.667 --> 00:51:08.170
? Everyday seems a little longer ?

674
00:51:08.237 --> 00:51:11.706
? Every way, love's a little stronger ?

675
00:51:11.806 --> 00:51:13.475
? Come what may ?

676
00:51:13.508 --> 00:51:15.810
? Do you ever long for ?

677
00:51:15.845 --> 00:51:18.981
? True love from me ?

678
00:51:19.015 --> 00:51:22.184
? Everyday, it's a gettin' closer ?

679
00:51:22.251 --> 00:51:25.855
? Goin' faster than a roller coaster ?

680
00:51:25.922 --> 00:51:31.426
? Love like yours will
surely come my way ?

681
00:51:31.526 --> 00:51:34.363
? Hey, hey, hey ?

682
00:52:04.559 --> 00:52:06.262
完美
Perfect.


683
00:52:23.312 --> 00:52:24.813
别担心 他们肯定会来的
Don't worry, I'm sure they're coming.


684
00:52:24.914 --> 00:52:27.249
可能有些人迷路了
You know, I bet some of them even got lost.


685
00:52:27.283 --> 00:52:30.485
大家参加派对的时候总是迟到
And people love to come late to parties.


686
00:52:30.585 --> 00:52:31.653
你到时候就知道了
You'll see.


687
00:52:34.323 --> 00:52:36.125
也许我应该打几个电话问问
Maybe I should give a few of them a call.


688
00:52:36.225 --> 00:52:38.760
厨房里好像有一份学校的联系表
I think I have a class list from the school in the kitchen.


689
00:52:38.793 --> 00:52:40.162
马上回来
Be right back.


690
00:53:07.156 --> 00:53:08.991
他们应该不会来了 小家伙
I don't think they're coming, buddy.


691
00:53:10.426 --> 00:53:12.294
我知道
I know.


692
00:53:12.361 --> 00:53:15.464
别觉得这是针对你的 好吗？
I don't want you to take it personally, okay?


693
00:53:15.498 --> 00:53:17.266
我们住得离市区太远了
We live really far out of town.


694
00:53:17.299 --> 00:53:19.135
有些人只是…
You know, some people, they just,


695
00:53:19.201 --> 00:53:23.671
没那么多时间来这么远的地方
they can't spend the time driving out here.


696
00:53:24.373 --> 00:53:26.308
好吗？
Okay?


697
00:53:26.375 --> 00:53:28.643
明年我们找家茶餐厅给你办派对
But hey, next year we'll have your party


698
00:53:28.676 --> 00:53:31.180
或者披萨店
at the malt shop or the pizza parlor.


699
00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.382
肯定很有意思
That'll be fun.


700
00:53:33.482 --> 00:53:35.317
好的
Okay.


701
00:53:35.351 --> 00:53:38.854
要打开你的礼物吗？
Do you wanna open your presents?


702
00:53:38.954 --> 00:53:40.356
暂时不要了
Not right now.


703
00:53:40.456 --> 00:53:42.624
我现在只想上楼回房间
I think I'm just going to go upstairs.


704
00:53:42.657 --> 00:53:44.293
你确定吗？
You sure?


705
00:53:44.326 --> 00:53:46.328
好的
Okay.


706
00:54:00.076 --> 00:54:01.510
别往这里打电话了 斯科特
Stop calling here, Scott.


707
00:54:01.576 --> 00:54:03.512
求你别挂我的电话 劳拉
Please don't hang up on me, Laura.


708
00:54:03.578 --> 00:54:06.315
求你跟我谈谈吧
Please talk to me.


709
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:09.684
该说的我都已经说过了
I've said everything I ever want to say to you.


710
00:54:09.751 --> 00:54:12.221
对不起 我真的很抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.


711
00:54:12.321 --> 00:54:14.656
我想你 想我儿子
I miss you. I miss my son.


712
00:54:14.689 --> 00:54:16.092
那你最好习惯这一点
Well, you better get used to it


713
00:54:16.192 --> 00:54:18.427
因为你再也见不到我们了
because you'll never see either one of us ever again.


714
00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:01.070
我也喜欢热点的设计
And I love the way our Hotpoint's designed too.


715
00:55:01.137 --> 00:55:02.972
简直是为我量身定做的
It could have been made for me.


716
00:55:03.906 --> 00:55:07.209
内部设计都非常实用
The interior arrangements are all so practical.


717
00:56:10.539 --> 00:56:12.274
科迪！
Cody!


718
00:56:12.308 --> 00:56:13.209
为什么？
Why?


719
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:14.776
你为什么没送出去？
Why didn't you hand these out?


720
00:56:14.809 --> 00:56:16.312
我花了那么多时间
I spent all that time


721
00:56:16.345 --> 00:56:18.847
想把你的生日派对办好
making a special day for your birthday


722
00:56:18.948 --> 00:56:20.616
而你就坐在那里
and you just sat there.


723
00:56:20.649 --> 00:56:23.285
坐在那里看我忙来忙去
You just sat there and watched me do it.


724
00:56:23.319 --> 00:56:25.654
但你根本连邀请信都没送出去！
And you didn't even hand out the invitations!


725
00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:26.989
为什么？
Why?


726
00:56:27.022 --> 00:56:27.957
为什么要这样？
Why would you do that?


727
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:29.491
科迪
Cody.


728
00:56:29.558 --> 00:56:30.893
科迪 不
Cody, no.


729
00:56:30.993 --> 00:56:32.661
科迪 回来
Cody, come back here.


730
00:56:35.464 --> 00:56:36.465
科迪
Cody,


731
00:56:36.498 --> 00:56:38.133
科迪
Cody,


732
00:56:38.167 --> 00:56:39.535
科迪 停下
Cody, stop it right now.


733
00:56:39.635 --> 00:56:41.837
-告诉我！ -因为他们不会来的
- Now, tell me! - Because they wouldn't come.


734
00:56:41.904 --> 00:56:43.906
你不听我说话 你不听任何人说话！
You don't listen to me. You don't listen to anyone!


735
00:56:44.006 --> 00:56:45.174
你怎么知道？
How would you know that?


736
00:56:45.241 --> 00:56:46.175
你根本没给他们机会
You didn't even give them a chance.


737
00:56:46.208 --> 00:56:47.009
因为我跟他们不一样
Because I'm not like them.


738
00:56:47.042 --> 00:56:47.977
我讨厌这里
I hate it here.


739
00:56:48.010 --> 00:56:49.478
我想回家
I want to go home.


740
00:56:49.511 --> 00:56:51.513
我们不会回去的 明白了吗？
We are not going back there. Do you hear me?


741
00:56:54.483 --> 00:56:57.052
科迪
Cody.


742
00:57:00.356 --> 00:57:01.523
科迪 怎么…
Cody, what...


743
00:57:01.557 --> 00:57:02.891
你怎么了？
What is wrong with you?


744
00:57:02.992 --> 00:57:03.992
科迪
Cody, Cody,


745
00:57:04.026 --> 00:57:04.927
别这样
please.


746
00:57:05.027 --> 00:57:06.362
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.


747
00:57:06.395 --> 00:57:07.930
好了
Okay.


748
00:57:08.030 --> 00:57:10.432
跟妈妈一起呼吸 深呼吸
Breathe with Mommy. Breathe, baby.


749
00:57:30.386 --> 00:57:32.087
如果你又感觉不舒服了
If you start to feel bad again,


750
00:57:32.187 --> 00:57:34.256
就告诉老师 好吗？
you just tell the teacher, okay?


751
00:57:34.356 --> 00:57:36.091
好
Okay.


752
00:57:54.076 --> 00:57:55.544
劳拉
Laura.


753
00:57:58.047 --> 00:57:59.448
劳拉
Laura.


754
00:58:02.618 --> 00:58:04.420
劳拉！
Laura!


755
00:58:04.453 --> 00:58:07.256
一个小时之内 把新的DM40放在我的桌子上
I need that new DM 40 on my desk in an hour.


756
00:58:09.425 --> 00:58:12.761
DM40是文件中最重要的表格
The DM4's the most crucial form in the file.


757
00:58:12.828 --> 00:58:15.097
嘿 科迪 今天过得怎么样？
Hey, Cody, how was your day?


758
00:58:15.164 --> 00:58:17.766
-还可以 -是吗？
- It was okay. - Yeah?


759
00:58:21.937 --> 00:58:25.574
科迪 你是不是捉弄那些小姑娘了？
Cody, have you been teasing those little girls?


760
00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:28.911
没有
No.


761
00:58:28.944 --> 00:58:30.346
你确定吗？
Are you sure?


762
00:58:30.446 --> 00:58:31.780
嗯
Yes.


763
00:58:31.814 --> 00:58:34.750
她们好像在跟老师告你的状
'Cause I can see them tattling on you to a teacher.


764
00:58:37.619 --> 00:58:39.130
在我今晚接到老师电话之前
Do you want to give me your side of the story


765
00:58:39.154 --> 00:58:40.789
你想给我讲讲你那版本的故事吗？
before I get a call tonight?


766
00:58:40.823 --> 00:58:42.624
我什么也没做
I didn't do anything.


767
00:58:43.258 --> 00:58:45.294
好吧 那我就等电话吧
All right, I'll wait for the call.


768
00:59:24.967 --> 00:59:26.635
兰特里夫人？
Mrs. Langtree?


769
00:59:27.903 --> 00:59:30.072
哦 你好
Oh, oh, hello.


770
00:59:30.172 --> 00:59:32.975
我只是在检查设备
I was just checking on the appliances.


771
00:59:33.008 --> 00:59:34.743
-真的吗？ -是的
- Really? - Yeah.


772
00:59:34.844 --> 00:59:37.513
我不这么认为 你是在窥探吧
I don't think so. I think you were snooping.


773
00:59:37.546 --> 00:59:40.082
找到你想找的毒品了吗？
Did you find the drugs you were looking for?


774
00:59:40.182 --> 00:59:41.550
这是我的房子
You know, this is my house


775
00:59:41.617 --> 00:59:43.294
所以我可以随时来检查
so I can actually check on it anytime I want.


776
00:59:43.318 --> 00:59:44.629
没有我的许可你就不可以
Not without my permission, you can't.


777
00:59:44.653 --> 00:59:46.321
如果你想确定这一点
And if you'd like to validate that,


778
00:59:46.355 --> 00:59:47.990
我们可以让警察跟你说
we can call the police.


779
00:59:48.023 --> 00:59:49.591
警察？
The police?


780
00:59:49.691 --> 00:59:51.360
是的
Mm-hmm.


781
00:59:52.027 --> 00:59:54.831
你是有什么毛病吗？
Is there something wrong with you?


782
00:59:54.864 --> 00:59:57.867
因为我觉得这座房子里有些事情
Because I think there's something terribly wrong


783
00:59:57.933 --> 00:59:59.268
非常不对劲
going on in this house.


784
00:59:59.368 --> 01:00:00.335
如果你搞清楚了
Well, when you figure it out,


785
01:00:00.369 --> 01:00:02.004
能告诉我一声吗？
will you give me a holler?


786
01:00:02.037 --> 01:00:04.273
因为我太想知道了
Because I would just love to know.


787
01:00:04.373 --> 01:00:07.877
我要求你从这里搬走
I want you out of this house.


788
01:00:07.911 --> 01:00:10.045
你有30天
You have 30 days.


789
01:00:10.112 --> 01:00:11.713
给我书面通知
Put it in writing.


790
01:00:11.747 --> 01:00:12.948
我会的
Oh, I will.


791
01:00:13.048 --> 01:00:14.918
30天

792
01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:17.686

798
01:00:36.873 --> 01:00:39.441
? She give me Katchi ?

799
01:00:39.541 --> 01:00:43.913
? All night long ?

800
01:00:43.947 --> 01:00:47.115
? She give me Katchi ?

801
01:00:47.216 --> 01:00:51.987
? All night long ?

802
01:00:52.087 --> 01:00:53.923
? Well, well, well ?

803
01:00:53.989 --> 01:00:55.824
? It's been a long day ?

804
01:00:55.925 --> 01:00:59.728
? I'm kinda tired, bring
your soothing arms my way ?

805
01:00:59.761 --> 01:01:03.599
? My back is achin'
and my body sore ?

806
01:01:03.632 --> 01:01:07.302
? Don't stop, honey, you
know that I want more ?

807
01:01:07.402 --> 01:01:10.439
? She give me Katchi ?

808
01:01:10.472 --> 01:01:14.978
? All night long ?

809
01:01:15.077 --> 01:01:17.947
? She give me Katchi ?

810
01:01:18.013 --> 01:01:20.950
? All night long ?

811
01:01:21.016 --> 01:01:23.085
? All night ?

812
01:01:36.098 --> 01:01:39.668
当她来的时候 她会绕山而来
? She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes ?


813
01:01:39.768 --> 01:01:45.173
当她来的时候 她会绕山而来
? She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes ?


814
01:01:46.675 --> 01:01:48.119
她会绕山而来
? She'll be coming around the mountain ?


815
01:01:48.143 --> 01:01:49.879
她会绕山而来
? She'll be coming around the mountain ?


816
01:01:49.979 --> 01:01:53.649
当她来的时候 她会绕山而来
? She'll be coming around the mountain when she comes ?


817
01:01:53.715 --> 01:01:55.817
科迪 不！
Cody, no!


818
01:02:00.957 --> 01:02:02.391
科迪
Cody.


819
01:02:17.205 --> 01:02:19.074
你好
Hello.


820
01:02:19.174 --> 01:02:21.010
你在哪？
Where are you?


821
01:02:21.044 --> 01:02:22.344
我已经准备好了
I'm ready.


822
01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:32.421
科迪？
Cody?


823
01:02:33.822 --> 01:02:34.991
科迪？
Cody?


824
01:02:36.358 --> 01:02:38.027
科迪 停下！
Cody, stop!


825
01:03:33.815 --> 01:03:35.751
科迪
Cody, Cody.


826
01:03:35.817 --> 01:03:36.986
呼吸
Please breathe.


827
01:03:37.086 --> 01:03:38.320
呼吸 宝贝
Breathe, baby.


828
01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:41.124
对 就这样 宝贝
There. That's right, baby. That's right.


829
01:03:41.223 --> 01:03:42.424
你没事了
You're okay.


830
01:03:42.457 --> 01:03:45.427
哦 科迪
Oh, Cody. Cody.


831
01:03:48.330 --> 01:03:51.067
科迪
Cody.


832
01:04:26.135 --> 01:04:27.870
我收到过很多次投诉
I've had repeated complaints


833
01:04:27.970 --> 01:04:30.973
关于DM40归档不正确或者不完整
about the DM 40 being filed incorrectly or incomplete,


834
01:04:31.007 --> 01:04:34.309
没有给文件附上正确的信函
not attaching your correspondence to the proper files.


835
01:04:34.376 --> 01:04:36.378
我会努力改进的
I'll try to get better at that.


836
01:04:36.478 --> 01:04:39.481
为审计员妥善维护档案
It's extremely important that you maintain


837
01:04:39.514 --> 01:04:42.417
是非常重要的
proper maintenance of the files for the auditors.


838
01:04:42.517 --> 01:04:44.319
准确性是对我们的评分标准
We're graded on accuracy.


839
01:04:44.386 --> 01:04:48.858
如果达不到某个标准 我们是要交罚款的
There're fines implemented if we don't meet a certain standard.


840
01:04:48.958 --> 01:04:52.028
我明白
I understand.


841
01:04:52.128 --> 01:04:54.997
劳拉 我要问你一个私人问题
Laura, I have to ask you a personal question.


842
01:04:56.364 --> 01:04:57.967
你是不是一直在喝酒？
Have you been drinking?


843
01:04:59.234 --> 01:05:02.905
我知道你喝了 我能闻到
I know you have. I can smell it.


844
01:05:03.005 --> 01:05:05.007
我们不能容忍在工作时间饮酒
We don't tolerate drinking on the job.


845
01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:07.375
这在员工手册中已经明确写出了
That's clearly stated in your employee handbook.


846
01:05:07.476 --> 01:05:09.011
是的
Yes, it is.


847
01:05:09.078 --> 01:05:10.880
我知道 因为我读过
I know because I read it.


848
01:05:13.983 --> 01:05:16.551
但如果让你过我的生活 你也会喝酒的
But I think that if you had my job, you'd be drinking too.


849
01:05:16.651 --> 01:05:19.521
离开你的家人和朋友
You try leaving your family and your friends


850
01:05:19.554 --> 01:05:21.023
以及你熟悉的一切
and everything you've ever known


851
01:05:21.057 --> 01:05:23.926
搬到一个偏僻的小镇
to move to this small town in the middle of nowhere,


852
01:05:24.026 --> 01:05:25.194
只能靠自己
all by yourself,


853
01:05:25.260 --> 01:05:28.530
因为没有人给你任何其他选择 先试试这些
simply because no one gave you any other choice.


854
01:05:28.563 --> 01:05:30.532
然后再跟我谈工作期间饮酒的事
Then talk to me about drinking on the job.


855
01:05:30.565 --> 01:05:31.566
劳拉 听着
Laura, look.


856
01:05:31.666 --> 01:05:33.002
或者我们有一份
Or maybe there's a company manual


857
01:05:33.035 --> 01:05:36.038
关于如何摆脱怪物的员工手册
on how to get rid of a monster.


858
01:05:36.072 --> 01:05:38.707
而且我不是在谈论我的前夫
And I'm not talking about my ex-husband


859
01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:43.112
也不是在说让我喘不过来气的压力
or my entire overwhelming situation.


860
01:05:43.212 --> 01:05:47.216
我是在说一个真正的怪物
No, I am talking about an actual monster


861
01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:50.186
它半夜来到我家
who comes into my house in the middle of the night


862
01:05:50.219 --> 01:05:51.586
想把我儿子拖出去
and tries to drag my son out


863
01:05:51.686 --> 01:05:53.923
淹死在房子后面的池塘里
and drown him in a pond out back.


864
01:05:56.792 --> 01:05:58.895
我知道你觉得我疯了
I know you think I'm nuts.


865
01:05:58.928 --> 01:06:00.428
不
No.


866
01:06:00.529 --> 01:06:01.563
我没这么想
I don't think that.


867
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:03.266
我觉得你需要帮助
I think you need help.


868
01:06:03.365 --> 01:06:04.599
我不需要帮助
I do not need help.


869
01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:06.969
一切都在我的控制中
I have everything completely under control.


870
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:08.703
才不是呢
No, you don't.


871
01:06:08.737 --> 01:06:11.740
我们完全可以帮助你这样的女性
There's no reason we can't help women like you.


872
01:06:11.773 --> 01:06:12.975
上面有电话号码
There's a number there.


873
01:06:13.075 --> 01:06:17.046
打电话 跟护士或者咨询师谈谈
Call it, speak to a nurse or counselor.


874
01:06:17.079 --> 01:06:22.517
我觉得这个应该留给你
Actually, I think you should keep this


875
01:06:22.617 --> 01:06:23.728
因为我不需要你的帮助
because I don't want your help


876
01:06:23.752 --> 01:06:26.088
也不需要你可怜的工作
and I don't want your miserable job.


877
01:06:26.155 --> 01:06:27.556
那就走吧
Then go.


878
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:29.058
我走了 老爹
I'm gone, daddy-o.

886
01:06:54.616 --> 01:06:59.322
? All night long ?

887
01:06:59.421 --> 01:07:01.423
? Well, well, well ?

888
01:07:01.456 --> 01:07:03.860
? It's been a long day ?

889
01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:06.829
? I'm kinda tired, bring
your soothing arms my way ?

890
01:07:06.929 --> 01:07:08.463
哇
Whoa.


891
01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:10.599
看着你
Look at you.


892
01:07:10.632 --> 01:07:12.301
琴吉·罗杰斯 （注：美国著名演员）

893
01:07:12.335 --> 01:07:15.304
你的啤酒喝完了
Your beer is empty.


894
01:07:15.338 --> 01:07:16.638
我再给你买一瓶
I'm going to buy you another.


895
01:07:16.671 --> 01:07:18.140
酒保 再给他来一瓶

896
01:07:18.174 --> 01:07:20.142
我要一瓶这个
And can I have another one of those?


897
01:07:20.176 --> 01:07:20.943
别这样
No, no, no, please.


898
01:07:20.977 --> 01:07:22.444
我不能让你请我喝酒
You, you don't buy me a drink.


899
01:07:22.477 --> 01:07:23.980
别这样 我在庆祝
Come on, I'm celebrating.


900
01:07:24.013 --> 01:07:25.480
庆祝什么？
Oh, what are we celebrating?


901
01:07:25.513 --> 01:07:27.316
我今天辞职了

902

我讨厌它 所以就辞了

我喜欢你的风格

906
01:07:35.624 --> 01:07:38.460
我就请你喝酒

907
01:07:38.493 --> 01:07:40.162
哦
Oh.


908
01:07:40.229 --> 01:07:41.163
来吧
Come on.


909
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:42.999
就一支舞
One dance.


910
01:07:47.837 --> 01:07:49.205
你知道这首歌吗？
You know this song?


911
01:07:49.305 --> 01:07:50.505
不知道
Mm-mm.


912
01:07:50.538 --> 01:07:53.575
很老了 慢慢被人遗忘了
Yeah, well, it's old and forgotten.


913
01:07:53.675 --> 01:07:56.145
有点像我
Kinda like me.


914
01:07:56.178 --> 01:07:57.579
但是你
But, you,


915
01:07:57.679 --> 01:08:01.150
年轻又漂亮
you are a pretty young thing


916
01:08:01.183 --> 01:08:04.887
穿着漂亮的小圆点连衣裙
in a pretty little polka dot dress.


917
01:08:07.689 --> 01:08:09.325
看起来像个天使
You look like an angel.


918
01:08:10.659 --> 01:08:13.029
我的意思是...
I mean like...


919
01:08:13.062 --> 01:08:16.198
就好像我已经死了 现在身处天堂
like I died and went to heaven.


920
01:08:18.901 --> 01:08:20.202
我确实当过天使
I was an angel once


921
01:08:20.236 --> 01:08:22.737
在教堂的一次戏剧演出里
in a play at church.


922
01:08:23.906 --> 01:08:27.877
我外婆给我做了漂亮的天使翅膀
My grandmother made me the most beautiful angel wings.


923
01:08:27.944 --> 01:08:31.080
我觉得穿上那些翅膀好像就能飞了
I felt like I could fly in those wings.


924
01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:32.348
像你这样的女孩
A girl like you,


925
01:08:32.381 --> 01:08:35.051
不需要翅膀就能飞翔
you don't need wings to fly.


926
01:08:35.084 --> 01:08:36.718
对 我有车
No, I have a car.


927
01:08:36.785 --> 01:08:39.221
对 这就行了
Oh, well, that'll do.


928
01:08:39.288 --> 01:08:40.289
车确实很有用
That's pretty good.


929
01:08:41.057 --> 01:08:43.292
那你接下来要做什么 天使？
So what are you going to do next, angel?


930
01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:50.099
我不知道
I don't know.


931
01:08:50.199 --> 01:08:51.300
我不知道
I don't know.


932
01:08:53.202 --> 01:08:53.970
嘿
Hey, hey, hey.


933
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.636
别哭呀
Don't cry.


934
01:08:54.736 --> 01:08:55.938
别哭
Don't cry.


935
01:08:56.038 --> 01:08:57.478
你会想出办法的
You're going to figure something out.


936
01:08:59.741 --> 01:09:02.244
我想去别的地方
I just wish I could go somewhere else,


937
01:09:02.311 --> 01:09:04.313
一个新的地方
you know, somewhere new


938
01:09:04.413 --> 01:09:05.780
然后重新开始
and start fresh.


939
01:09:05.881 --> 01:09:07.816
就是…重新开始
Just, just start over.


940
01:09:09.118 --> 01:09:11.420
那你就走吧
Then you go,


941
01:09:11.454 --> 01:09:15.590
找出你漂亮的小翅膀
you dig out those pretty little wings of yours


942
01:09:15.657 --> 01:09:19.261
然后展翅高飞
and you fly, fly, fly.


943
01:09:49.624 --> 01:09:50.826
科迪
Cody.


944

警官 我来接我儿子

962
01:10:38.908 --> 01:10:41.010
没告诉我就把他接走了

972
01:11:03.399 --> 01:11:04.867
科迪在哪？

973
01:11:04.934 --> 01:11:07.012
我去学校接他 他不在
I went to school to pick him up and he was not there.


974
01:11:07.036 --> 01:11:08.504
对 他不在

975

你觉得他在哪里？
Where do you think he is?


976
01:11:11.841 --> 01:11:12.942
他爸爸把他接走了？

979

你给他打电话了？
Did you call him?


980
01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.682
我不用打电话
I didn't need to.


981
01:11:20.715 --> 01:11:23.552
你什么意思？
What do you mean?


982
01:11:23.618 --> 01:11:26.055
劳拉
Laura,


983
01:11:26.088 --> 01:11:29.125
我们能不能先同步下信息？
would you mind if we backed up a little bit?


984
01:11:29.225 --> 01:11:31.227
如果我能了解科迪事故的细节
I think I could be of more help


985
01:11:31.293 --> 01:11:34.597
我应该能给你提供更多帮助
if I understood the details of Cody's accident.


986
01:11:34.696 --> 01:11:39.301
我指的是去年在亚利桑那发生的事故
I'm referring to the accident last year in Arizona.


987
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:42.905
哦
Oh.


988
01:11:43.939 --> 01:11:45.474
不是大事
Well, that was nothing.


989
01:11:45.574 --> 01:11:47.476
他掉进了游泳池
He fell in the pool.


990
01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:52.780
我当时不在
I wasn't there.


991
01:11:52.882 --> 01:11:56.018
我去超市买东西了
I had to go to the grocery store.


992
01:11:56.118 --> 01:11:59.155
他父亲在家看着他
His father was watching him.


993
01:12:02.324 --> 01:12:05.261
我到家的时候 斯科特正坐在沙发上看球赛
When I came home, Scott was on the couch, watching the game


994
01:12:05.294 --> 01:12:07.096
我走进厨房
and I went into the kitchen


995
01:12:07.129 --> 01:12:11.500
有一种奇怪的感觉 好像出了什么事
and I had this weird feeling like something wrong.


996
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.935
而我站在水池边
And I was standing at the sink


997
01:12:13.002 --> 01:12:14.722
看着窗外的游泳池
and I was looking out the window at the pool


998
01:12:14.769 --> 01:12:16.839
好像看到里面有什么东西
and I thought I saw something in it.


999
01:12:17.506 --> 01:12:21.277
我出去检查 发现是他
When I went out to check, I saw that it was him.


1000
01:12:22.077 --> 01:12:26.015
然后发生了什么？
And then what happened?


1001
01:12:27.116 --> 01:12:29.518
我把他拖了出来
Well, I dragged him out


1002
01:12:29.618 --> 01:12:30.818
给他做了心肺复苏术
and I performed CPR on him


1003
01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.621
然后急救人员到了
until the paramedics came


1004
