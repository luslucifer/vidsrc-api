<i>(male announcer)
In breaking news, the asteroid "WE2007"</i>


2
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.520
<i>now appears to have broken up
under Jupiter's gravity, making earth
impact more likely.</i>

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.616
(female announcer)

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.640
<i>( multi-lingual crosstalk )</i>

5
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.940
if the asteroid stays it's course, it
will make impact with the United
Kingdom within 24 hours...


6
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.548
<i>the meteorite is on a collision
course for London.</i>


7
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.440
<i>( more multi-lingual crosstalk )</i>

8
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.940
it will hit an area across London...
<i>People across London and the Southeast
have reported seeing a large meteor</i>


9
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.590
<i>flashing across the sky.</i>

10
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.973
(bystanders)
<i>it was this... really bright light,</i>
it looked - a meteorite...


11
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.039
but I don't know if you
get them around here.


12
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.040
<i>We can now confirm that a
meteor has struck,</i>


13
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.416
<i>in Peckham, South London.</i> a meteorite...
impact... in the United Kingdom.


14
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.040
Specifically in England...
London.


15
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.277
Specifically, Peckham.

16
00:01:03.603 --> 00:01:06.420
My dog was like, very wide-eyed,
you know.


17
00:01:07.253 --> 00:01:10.920
It only ever gets that look when he,
when he sees a bitch across the park.


18
00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:15.211
Or a meteorite, I know that now.
<i>- A man can be seen in the direct path
of the meteor.</i>


19
00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:18.216
A man was hit by a meteor today, as
seen... <i>extraordinary footage here</i>


20
00:01:18.253 --> 00:01:21.211
A postman, Robert Kenner, has been
struck by the meteorite.


21
00:01:21.336 --> 00:01:24.128
Robert Kenner, the man
struck by a meteorite,


22
00:01:24.253 --> 00:01:27.378
has apparently disappeared from the
hospital he was taken to.


23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.211
There are increasing number of reports
of a flying man seen over Peckham


24
00:01:33.253 --> 00:01:36.836
More witnesses are going forward
claiming to have seen a flying man
in Peckham.


25
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:40.378
Who is the flying man?
- Bob from the depot, yeah.


26
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.086
The may be a link, between the
meteor strike, and the flying
postman of Peckham.


27
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:49.111
He's been getting quicker, on his route,
and the two things got all like...


28
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.740
Probably wrong...
but I'm not.


29
00:01:50.836 --> 00:01:55.878
Footage emerged today of a man flying
through the Shard. <i>-Shit! Sorry!</i>


30
00:01:56.003 --> 00:02:00.628
Causing thousands of pounds worth of
damage. - We didn't go out looking
for Bob, Bob came to us.


31
00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:04.753
He handed himself in...
- Hey, Bob! <i>- Hello mate!</i>


32
00:02:04.878 --> 00:02:09.461
He no control over his powers
<i>- I see I've broken with these</i>
We had to train him up.


33
00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:11.586
Flight Test One.

34
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.040
I don't know how to stop!

35
00:02:15.041 --> 00:02:17.031
The baby's alive!

36
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.640
Test the limits of his abilities.
- Bob? <i>Oh God! Oh, Jesus Christ, Oh!</i>


37
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.854
The flying postman from Peckham has
been secluded inside the Ministry of
defense for the last four months.


38
00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:29.128
Why are you doing that?
- just a bit nervous.


39
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.561
And he responded well...

40
00:02:33.378 --> 00:02:37.211
And when we perfected the system,
Bob went out into the world.


41
00:02:37.886 --> 00:02:39.911
After months of speculation,

42
00:02:40.036 --> 00:02:45.336
the man who developed superpowers has
been unveiled by the British government.
And his name... is SuperBob.


43
00:02:45.836 --> 00:02:49.045
I am proud of him,
and of the work we do.


44
00:02:59.503 --> 00:03:04.753
SuperBob will be working for the UK
government, and the Ministry of Defense.


45
00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:09.461
The world will no longer be the same
again. A Superhero...
for the real world.


46
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:15.295
It's funny what we get
used to, isn't it?


47
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.795
I mean... He can <i>fly.</i>

48
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.370
SuperBob.

49
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.000
Name's a bit wank.

50
00:03:29.003 --> 00:03:33.836
It's arrogant, in a way but...
looks like it stick him.


51
00:03:43.045 --> 00:03:48.211
Um, could you tell me your, uh...
your name, and your... job? Please.


52
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:52.211
My name is Teresa Maria Ford.

53
00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:57.128
I am the head of the emergency
response / disaster unit.


54
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.920
But you can't use any of that.

55
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:06.128
I can use it? - You can't use any of
it, no. - I can't use your name, even?
- No. -Okay.


56
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:12.378
You have - you - a very, very
important job, as far as I understand.
- Um-hm.


57
00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:17.420
Could you tell us a little bit about
what that job involves?


58
00:04:17.545 --> 00:04:19.645
No.

59
00:04:20.753 --> 00:04:25.170
Would it be okay to ask you why
you wanted to make this film?


60
00:04:25.295 --> 00:04:29.086
We feel that perhaps the public
doesn't know the real Bob.


61
00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:35.086
And I - I just feel it's really our
duty to let people know that Bob is


62
00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:39.711
Just a regular guy.
Who can fly.


63
00:04:42.253 --> 00:04:47.878
Yes, I have two bills. I've got one from
British Gas and one from you and, um


64
00:04:48.003 --> 00:04:52.670
Yes, I'm sure it's my fault
I don't mind, it's just I wanted to...


65
00:04:56.628 --> 00:05:00.420
Um... can I call you back in a bit, please?
Thank you.


66
00:05:00.545 --> 00:05:04.128
Hello, I'm John, we're
making the film today.


67
00:05:04.253 --> 00:05:08.795
Is that today? - Yeah, yeah it's today.
Theresa said you knew about it?


68
00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:15.045
Oh, no 
- Bob...

69
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.220
Hi, I'm Bob, Bob...
Can I - can I -
Good morning.


70
00:05:18.345 --> 00:05:21.170
Just your normal voice is fine here, Bob.
No, Bob...


71
00:05:21.295 --> 00:05:25.003
Good morning. - Just...
- Good morning! - Just this...
-Hey, Hey! -Bob, just wait!


72
00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:27.711
Thanks for having us.
- You're welcome!


73
00:05:27.836 --> 00:05:32.295
Hi, I'm Bob. - Hey, Bob. - Hey, Doris.
That's Doris, that's my cleaner...


74
00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.520
Have you done the sheets yet?

75
00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:39.961
Not yet. - then, can I start
in the bathroom, please?


76
00:05:41.295 --> 00:05:44.003
Yep. Makes sense.

77
00:05:44.628 --> 00:05:50.753
'Kay, what is all this? - Um, they're
making a film to show that I'm normal.


78
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.520
Oh, good luck!

79
00:05:53.836 --> 00:05:56.128
This way? 
- Yeah, that's great.

80
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.211
That's the way, right.

81
00:06:04.336 --> 00:06:06.436
Yep.

82
00:06:07.378 --> 00:06:10.878
May I ask you your name, and
your job, please?


83
00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:15.628
You may. My name is Bob Kenner
and I'm a civil servant.


84
00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.461
You don't say superhero?
- We don't use that word.


85
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.461
I mean, you can use that word, but,
I would...


86
00:06:23.711 --> 00:06:29.295
I mean, it's just a job and I
have shifts just like anyone else.


87
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.211
So, just talk me through from, from,
You wake up, what happens?


88
00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:39.003
Well, I get up and,

89
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.140
I've a massive wee...

90
00:06:41.211 --> 00:06:44.628
A bomb goes off in Afghanistan,
Boom! Chaos!


91
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.940
I'm leaving a gap here so if you want
to put like, news footage of, you know,
like a bomb, or chaos,


92
00:06:54.961 --> 00:06:58.628
or whatever, just to, just to jazz up,
I don't want to tell you how to
do your job, but


93
00:06:58.753 --> 00:07:01.878
I imagine this is probably just...
pretty bleak.


94
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.840
This is an E-179.

95
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.840
This is to set up a temporary No Fly
Zone, make sure that nothing bumps
into me up there,


96
00:07:14.878 --> 00:07:19.586
which is actually quite important
because there is a lot less room up
there than you might think.


97
00:07:19.711 --> 00:07:24.503
Like I'm really, I'm really glad to
be alive, I'm really glad to have
been saved, but he's just a bit...


98
00:07:24.628 --> 00:07:26.728
I mean, sign your own fucking form.

99
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.140
This is a combined insurance.

100
00:07:29.295 --> 00:07:33.920
Eyewitnesses report that Kenner
tried to get the baby to sign a form.


101
00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:36.795
He then panicked, and
quickly flew off.


102
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.840
Temporary jurisdiction proposal.

103
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.240
We. like. order.

104
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:43.753
An S12658P.

105
00:07:44.003 --> 00:07:48.295
"I've got to fill out a form."
Of course you have to fill out a form!


106
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.045
How is there going to
be a record of it?


107
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.086
How would you rate the
experience out of ten?


108
00:07:54.211 --> 00:07:57.295
I mean, a solid six, you know.
I mean, I didn't die.


109
00:07:58.336 --> 00:08:03.003
There is a lot happening
- How stressful do you find your job?


110
00:08:03.128 --> 00:08:06.378
Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.


111
00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:11.253
Are you with <i>Eon</i> or <i>British Gas</i>?
- Um, why?


112
00:08:12.461 --> 00:08:17.211
Uh, I'm not taking sides or anything
but I think I might have signed up to
both of them by mistake.


113
00:08:17.336 --> 00:08:20.011
I'm with <i>Southern Electric</i>.

114
00:08:20.136 --> 00:08:24.120
Damn it. They came round last week,
I said I didn't have time.


115
00:08:24.245 --> 00:08:27.586
Are they good?
- Seem to be. - Damn it!


116
00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:31.920
Well, I was really excited to meet him,
because, you know,
he can fly, for starters,


117
00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:37.295
Which is brilliant,
But take that away, and really,
he's just a bit of a dullard.


118
00:08:37.545 --> 00:08:41.586
And it pains me to say that 'cause
all my mates and me thought he he was
fit before I met him.


119
00:08:41.711 --> 00:08:45.461
So I think the question that everybody
wants to know is...


120
00:08:46.128 --> 00:08:48.670
Does SuperBob have a girlfriend?

121
00:08:50.836 --> 00:08:53.878
No, SuperBob does not
have a girlfriend.


122
00:08:54.795 --> 00:09:00.295
Why is that?
- Because SuperBob is very busy.


123
00:09:04.795 --> 00:09:06.895
This is Peckham.

124
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.253
Not the Ritz, but it's home.

125
00:09:11.336 --> 00:09:16.628
People say it's a bit stabby, but it's
not actually. It's a bit,
but it's not a lot.


126
00:09:16.753 --> 00:09:19.961
The named this one after me.
It's sweet, really.


127
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:22.561
Hello, mate.

128
00:09:24.128 --> 00:09:26.495
Yo, air support.
- Yeah...


129
00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.970
That's the "Sun Do, Sun Don't".
I call it that..


130
00:09:29.095 --> 00:09:32.378
Full name is "Sun Do, Sun  Don't,
Sun Don't Mind if you Do At All".


131
00:09:32.503 --> 00:09:34.603
Just my little thing.

132
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:38.336
I mean I grew up in Peckham,
these are my ends.


133
00:09:39.336 --> 00:09:43.086
Everyone's friendly.
- SuperPrick!


134
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.420
Except for Daren. 
From the Estate.

135
00:09:48.336 --> 00:09:50.545
Not a fan.

136
00:09:51.586 --> 00:09:54.503
Almost definitely not his bike.

137
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:05.545
This is my favorite thing to do.
I only really get to do
it on my day off.


138
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.365
I mean it's... You know, it's, it's an
honor to have him.


139
00:10:33.545 --> 00:10:35.645
Yeah.

140
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:47.420
That was amazing!
That was such a good one!


141
00:10:47.545 --> 00:10:50.920
They were so good they said we
could finish early. That was amazing!


142
00:10:51.045 --> 00:10:53.670
It's just so good to feel
part of the community.


143
00:10:53.795 --> 00:10:57.295
It's the Peckham people. You
know what I mean? It's just...


144
00:11:06.086 --> 00:11:11.086
Sometimes I like to stay in on my day
off as well. Work on my projects.


145
00:11:13.503 --> 00:11:19.503
This one is for someone... Special.

146
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.670
Hello? 
- David?

147
00:11:25.795 --> 00:11:28.003
It's Bob, you called me.

148
00:11:28.128 --> 00:11:31.128
Who is Bob? 
- Bob, your son.

149
00:11:31.253 --> 00:11:34.086
You called me, Mum.
- I don't have a son.


150
00:11:34.211 --> 00:11:37.253
If I had a son, he would
come and visit me more.


151
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:43.711
I'm not suggesting that she's faking
it, but I do sometimes think that it's
quite a convenient disease.


152
00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:46.753
I heard that, Bob.
- Oh, now you remember my name.


153
00:11:47.003 --> 00:11:50.878
So are there any downsides to your
amazing life, Bob?


154
00:11:54.128 --> 00:12:00.336
It does get... lonely. Sometimes.

155
00:12:11.753 --> 00:12:14.461
He struggles, 'cause he's
got big fingers.


156
00:12:15.128 --> 00:12:18.753
Sorry, who's that? - Oh that's Barry,
my security. - You have security?


157
00:12:18.878 --> 00:12:23.670
Yeah. It's a union thing, he has to
watch over the house. He's got a shed.


158
00:12:24.086 --> 00:12:27.336
That seems... unnecessary. 
- Why?

159
00:12:28.128 --> 00:12:32.461
Because you're invulnerable.
- Well, it's a union thing.


160
00:12:34.611 --> 00:12:38.170
You were saying? He's got this
thyroid problem that affects him...
- No, um no...


161
00:12:38.295 --> 00:12:40.395
About being lonely.

162
00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:45.061
Oh, um, right.

163
00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:50.878
I guess, I have always
wanted someone....


164
00:12:54.003 --> 00:12:56.378
To shine my shoes with.

165
00:12:58.003 --> 00:13:00.103
I never had that.

166
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:06.170
But today... today, I am
making changes.


167
00:13:07.795 --> 00:13:11.420
Because today, 
I have a date.

168
00:13:13.545 --> 00:13:15.711
That's great! 
- Yeah.

169
00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:19.586
When were you last on a date?
- Six years ago.


170
00:13:19.711 --> 00:13:23.378
Doris, I trying to do an interview! Sorry.

171
00:13:27.403 --> 00:13:29.411
So, who's the date with?

172
00:13:32.253 --> 00:13:36.461
June is... The most beautiful
girl in Peckham.


173
00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:39.878
Can I say that?
I said it, it's true.


174
00:13:41.211 --> 00:13:46.336
She's the most beautiful girl in
the world, and I've been all over.


175
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.837
I remember the very first conversation
we ever had, like it was yesterday.


176
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:56.170
She says to me, "Have you ever read
House of Leaves?" And I'm like, "No."


177
00:13:56.295 --> 00:14:00.378
And she's like, "Well,
you should." So I did.


178
00:14:02.295 --> 00:14:04.395
That's where she works.

179
00:14:06.128 --> 00:14:09.854
Anyway, I didn't get it. It's like this
book, you have to sort of turn it
around as you read it,


180
00:14:09.878 --> 00:14:13.545
It's like this sort of spiraling...
I didn't get it.


181
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.045
But it was an icebreaker,
because then...


182
00:14:18.836 --> 00:14:22.271
Is that her? - I don't know which one
she is. - She's the most beautiful
one. Oh, I...


183
00:14:22.295 --> 00:14:25.086
Go go go go go, I'm going to look like
a right wheeler...


184
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:27.211
He's been coming in,
for about six months.


185
00:14:27.336 --> 00:14:30.503
He comes in every Tuesday
I know because I've been counting.


186
00:14:30.628 --> 00:14:34.628
Because it's... Well, you know.
Him. In here.


187
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.961
Everyone else is used to it, but...
I guess I'm just not..


188
00:14:43.836 --> 00:14:47.636
This is where I used to work. I used
to love working here, because
people are always excited....


189
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:51.295
Oh! Bob, come here!
- They'd be excited to get...


190
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.003
Bob, one second, just come here and...
- I don't know who she is.


191
00:14:55.378 --> 00:14:57.961
Bob. Come here.

192
00:14:58.928 --> 00:15:01.528
You must listen to big people when
when they talk and talk to you.


193
00:15:01.586 --> 00:15:04.146
Hold this for me, I'll soon come.
I'm gonna go on to the butcher's.


194
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.670
I'm just going to the butcher's before
it close. Please, just hold it,
yes indeedy.


195
00:15:07.795 --> 00:15:10.045
Just hold it, I'll soon come, Okay.

196
00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:15.086
Well, he's just not like other guys.

197
00:15:15.211 --> 00:15:18.503
I mean... He's really not.

198
00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:23.753
Like, every week I was taking out books
and bringing them back.


199
00:15:23.878 --> 00:15:27.420
Oh, he is a voracious reader.
- I was not reading any of them.


200
00:15:27.545 --> 00:15:32.212
He's read my favorite book,
which is very romantic.


201
00:15:32.378 --> 00:15:36.878
Because it's not an easy book.
- And then, after about six months...


202
00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:43.045
He started like, hanging around my desk
a lot... - Just like, mumbling about,
around her like an idiot.


203
00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:46.670
I thought, "Does he like me?"

204
00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:52.545
Eventually...
- Would SuperBob ever ask me out?


205
00:15:53.045 --> 00:15:56.003
Finally...
- Like, ever?


206
00:15:56.128 --> 00:15:58.711
She asked <i>me</i> out..

207
00:15:58.836 --> 00:16:00.936
And he said yes.

208
00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:03.636
It was unbelievable.

209
00:16:03.761 --> 00:16:07.961
So, finally, we're going on our date.
Today.


210
00:16:09.253 --> 00:16:11.670
Lunch. One o'clock.

211
00:16:12.503 --> 00:16:14.753
And I am very excited about it.

212
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:17.253
There is no accounting for tastes.

213
00:16:21.378 --> 00:16:26.211
I do actually need Maureen, because
I don't have a photo ID, so...


214
00:16:26.336 --> 00:16:28.436
I am done.

215
00:16:33.461 --> 00:16:37.794
It's Theresa. She wants to take me
shopping for clothes for the date.


216
00:16:38.378 --> 00:16:41.670
I don't need her for that.
I can buy clothes.


217
00:16:43.253 --> 00:16:45.253
How hard is it to buy clothes?

218
00:16:45.378 --> 00:16:50.628
Doris, I need you to help me buy
clothes, I've made a terrible mistake.
You need to take me shopping.


219
00:16:50.761 --> 00:16:55.461
I don't want to turn up at this date...
-You're like a pedophile. - Is that
what this combo says to you?


220
00:16:55.586 --> 00:16:59.146
It's not just the clothes, it's the
face. - Okay, well that's terrible,
I need clothes...


221
00:16:59.211 --> 00:17:01.878
You look like a man who has not
touched a woman in six years.


222
00:17:02.003 --> 00:17:04.845
I need clothes where I turn up and
I don't look like a weirdo.


223
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.121
You look desperate, and insane...
-You look like a terrorist. - Hello,
Barry. -That's because of his eyebrows.


224
00:17:09.145 --> 00:17:12.295
What is wrong with eyebrows?
-Terroristic. -You have terrorist
eyebrows.


225
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.378
I will buy you something.
- Anything?


226
00:17:16.503 --> 00:17:19.420
Yep. What do you need? 
- Socks.

227
00:17:19.545 --> 00:17:22.503
Let's go. You stay here. Just Doris.

228
00:17:24.003 --> 00:17:27.420
Alright, I'll stay, it's alright.
I'll have a bath or something.


229
00:17:29.836 --> 00:17:35.086
We'll walk one to the other and see
everything. In... two minutes.


230
00:17:35.211 --> 00:17:40.878
Hey! Umm... - Oh, Karl!
- Why don't you call me anymore?
- 'Cause... we had our fun.


231
00:17:41.003 --> 00:17:45.670
But I want more fun!
- We had our fun! Come on, Bob.


232
00:17:45.795 --> 00:17:49.295
Enjoying your day off, SuperBob?
- Oh, yes, thanks!


233
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.586
You lazy shit!

234
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.503
Do not listen to her. 
- I didn't.

235
00:17:55.920 --> 00:18:00.420
I thought you were still with Javier.
- Yes? Oh, Javier was over weeks ago.


236
00:18:00.545 --> 00:18:05.986
I'm so hungry. You like lemon?
- I'm okay with lemons, is that
what you want to eat it? - No.


237
00:18:06.111 --> 00:18:08.170
What is this?
- A pa-pa.


238
00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:13.128
A pa-pa? - What do you want to eat? I
don't know what it is. I always have...
Curiosity, what is it?


239
00:18:13.253 --> 00:18:17.003
Is it meat? Is it
cold, is it hot?


240
00:18:38.128 --> 00:18:40.961
What was wrong with Javier?

241
00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:44.545
He always took me bowling.

242
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.920
You hate bowling. 
- I know.

243
00:18:50.003 --> 00:18:53.253
I'm Bob's cleaner.
I clean twice a week.


244
00:18:53.378 --> 00:18:56.753
I also work at the care home
where his mother lives.


245
00:18:56.878 --> 00:19:02.003
I became very friendly with Mrs.
Kenner. And she tells me her
son needs help.


246
00:19:02.128 --> 00:19:04.461
He cannot tie his own shoelaces.

247
00:19:04.586 --> 00:19:08.086
And... that is how I
was stuck with Bob.


248
00:19:08.961 --> 00:19:13.211
Yeah. What, you're "Eon"?
I thought I'd already
spoken to you this...


249
00:19:13.336 --> 00:19:16.753
Is that "British Gas"?
Do you like this? - No.


250
00:19:16.878 --> 00:19:22.586
The, the thing is...
- I came here to raise money to
pay for a nursery in Colombia.


251
00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:28.878
It's taken me... six years, and I have
barely raised any money.


252
00:19:30.378 --> 00:19:33.961
They not pay shit in this country.
- I heard that.


253
00:19:34.295 --> 00:19:36.836
I found this really beautiful
monastery in Tibet.


254
00:19:36.961 --> 00:19:39.836
I'm gonna fly us there, I'm
gonna sit on this clifftop,


255
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:44.670
We overlook the whole of the place, we
eat noodles... Why are you laughing?
- Are you joking?


256
00:19:44.795 --> 00:19:50.753
No. - For a first date? -Yes.
-Do you want to look crazy?
-I definitely don't want to look crazy.


257
00:19:50.878 --> 00:19:54.670
Take her to... take her to the
"Curry Cabin" in Peckham.


258
00:19:54.836 --> 00:19:58.711
Really? - Yes, with your legs.
Don't be so keen.


259
00:19:58.836 --> 00:20:02.711
It's a nice place. Buy her Tikka
Masala, ask her lots of questions.
- Like what?


260
00:20:02.836 --> 00:20:06.003
Don't ask who supplies her
fucking gas.


261
00:20:06.861 --> 00:20:08.970
I wasn't going to.

262
00:20:09.095 --> 00:20:11.170
I wasn't going to!

263
00:20:11.295 --> 00:20:13.378
Ask her something personal.

264
00:20:13.503 --> 00:20:16.878
Okay, um... is your mother still
alive? - No, something else.


265
00:20:17.003 --> 00:20:20.628
And then, if it goes well,
then you can fly her about.


266
00:20:20.753 --> 00:20:25.336
Okay. - Don't play all your cards at
once. You'll scare her away.


267
00:20:25.461 --> 00:20:31.583
It's going to be alright, though,
isn't it? I just gotta be myself, right?
- Not if you want her to like you.


268
00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:34.778
Bob, when you're on this date,
turn off your fucking phone.


269
00:20:34.903 --> 00:20:38.037
Women hate being interrupted by
fucking phones. - It's Theresa.
It's Theresa, I have to take it.


270
00:20:38.061 --> 00:20:42.687
Fuck Theresa! Don't answer! It's your
day off... - Hello? Hey, hello Theresa.
No, no, I'm listening to angry Spanish talk radio.


271
00:20:42.711 --> 00:20:45.595
I need you to come into the office now.
- But... - It's an emergency.


272
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.803
Theresa, it's my day off.
- In my office, now, Bob.


273
00:20:48.928 --> 00:20:51.288
Okay, if it's an emergency.
- It's a fucking emergency, Bob!


274
00:20:51.386 --> 00:20:54.453
I have to go, I'm sorry.
Can you take care of everything?


275
00:20:54.578 --> 00:20:57.371
What about your date? You're just going
to cancel because the MOD called?


276
00:20:57.395 --> 00:21:00.453
No, No, I will go quickly to the MOD
and then I'll rush to my date.


277
00:21:00.578 --> 00:21:05.461
It will be fine, there'll be enough
time. - What if there's not time?
-Then, I'll postpone the date.


278
00:21:05.586 --> 00:21:08.420
You are pathetic!
- I'm not pathetic,
what choice do I have?


279
00:21:08.545 --> 00:21:14.086
What did these people do before you,
Bob? Sometimes we have to say No!
- I can't say No to the Ministry of Defense!


280
00:21:14.211 --> 00:21:18.045
It's not so hard to say "No".
- It's very hard to say...
- "No. Theresa, no, it's my day off."


281
00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.836
This from a woman who has never said
No in her entire life!


282
00:21:20.961 --> 00:21:25.378
"Oh, yes, Javier, yes, Karl,
yes, Simon, yes, Brian.


283
00:21:25.545 --> 00:21:28.920
I literally don't know the
meaning of the word 'No!


284
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:36.503
What did you say? - It was a...
doesn't matter, it was just a joke.


285
00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:39.545
What, you think a woman is not
allowed to have many partners?


286
00:21:39.670 --> 00:21:42.878
No, of course I don't think that.
- You think it makes her a whore, do you?


287
00:21:43.003 --> 00:21:47.586
A woman living her life, choosing what
she wants to... - I don't think all
women are whores.


288
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:51.503
Just you! I can't believe that
was the end of that sentence.


289
00:21:51.628 --> 00:21:55.003
I really thought there would be other
words, which would make it sound better


290
00:21:55.128 --> 00:22:01.461
Can I get <i>anything</i>? - I'd take your
losses, mate. -Yeah, I have to go. I...


291
00:22:01.753 --> 00:22:05.628
Wait, I have a form for you.
It says... to go fuck yourself.


292
00:22:07.336 --> 00:22:10.836
It's blank.
- It says, "Go fuck yourself."
Please sign it.


293
00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:13.920
It doesn't say anything.
- It's psychic paper.


294
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.770
Full name, please.

295
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:23.520
Can I please go now?

296
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.003
Go. Do your fucking thing.

297
00:22:32.845 --> 00:22:36.128
What's the emergency? -The American
situation is frying.


298
00:22:36.253 --> 00:22:39.753
Where do I need to be?
-Here, for a handshake. - Is that code?


299
00:22:39.878 --> 00:22:42.128
No, it's a handshake.
- Right.


300
00:22:42.253 --> 00:22:46.211
The senator is joining us for lunch,
you need you here for a Photo Op.


301
00:22:46.336 --> 00:22:51.878
Just a handshake, nothing heavy. Just a
Handshake. And a hug. And hold a baby.


302
00:22:52.003 --> 00:22:55.920
We've got a few scenarios that they've
agreed to. Um, the classic handshake...


303
00:22:56.045 --> 00:22:59.128
Hang on, what is this? - I need to
show you're not dangerous.


304
00:22:59.253 --> 00:23:01.695
I'm not dangerous. - I know that.
- I've never hurt anyone.


305
00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:06.271
We know you're not dangerous, Bob, but
this is the United States, they still
haven't forgiven us. - For what? - For you.


306
00:23:06.295 --> 00:23:08.336
They're still pissed off you're ours.

307
00:23:08.461 --> 00:23:11.045
I'm going to tell you
this off the record.


308
00:23:12.128 --> 00:23:14.228
Off the record, okay?

309
00:23:16.045 --> 00:23:19.836
About a year ago, America
made a move on Bob.


310
00:23:20.503 --> 00:23:23.086
They tried to poach him,
but we wouldn't let him go.


311
00:23:23.211 --> 00:23:29.545
And ever since then, a smear
campaign started, from across the Pond.


312
00:23:30.045 --> 00:23:32.145
Infecting everything.

313
00:23:33.086 --> 00:23:35.186
Coincidence?

314
00:23:36.086 --> 00:23:38.186
You do the math.

315
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.878
In Texas today SuperBob saved

316
00:23:43.003 --> 00:23:47.003
There were no injuries.
-They send him into a burning
school to save the children.


317
00:23:47.128 --> 00:23:50.521
Now I'm not disagreeing that he
saved the children, he did save
the children, that's by the by.


318
00:23:50.545 --> 00:23:55.586
But what kind of "Superhero"
smashes up a school? A <i>school</i>?


319
00:23:58.961 --> 00:24:03.711
Now, this is one of their favorites.
It's you, kneeling, obviously.


320
00:24:04.545 --> 00:24:10.670
With a gigantic American flag,
like, flapping behind you.


321
00:24:11.378 --> 00:24:15.295
Does it have to be today? - Yes,
they're all here for tonight's summit.


322
00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:20.045
It's my day off. - Do you think I like
calling you in on your day off?
Because I don't.


323
00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:24.128
Okay, it makes me feel awful, but
unfortunately, that is part of my job.


324
00:24:24.253 --> 00:24:26.461
Now this deal has taken a long
time to broker.


325
00:24:26.586 --> 00:24:31.211
Yeah, these mountains are not currently
snow capped. Now these are not condors
they are not vultures,


326
00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:35.378
Don't make the same mistake I did,
they are bald eagles.


327
00:24:35.503 --> 00:24:40.586
Um, their handler is a lovely man named
Clint... - What about my date? - What?


328
00:24:41.086 --> 00:24:43.186
My date.

329
00:24:44.503 --> 00:24:50.253
Oh, Bob. She'll wait.
- They're no danger to Bob, in any way.


330
00:24:50.461 --> 00:24:53.503
Postpone the date. 
She'll be fine.

331
00:24:54.086 --> 00:25:01.170
We will however have like, a few
carcases, sort of scattered
around the rocks,


332
00:25:01.295 --> 00:25:04.503
to get them interested, to get them
excited, to get them swooshing.


333
00:25:06.878 --> 00:25:08.978
If they do go for Bob...

334
00:25:09.753 --> 00:25:11.853
What if I don't want to?

335
00:25:12.586 --> 00:25:14.686
What do you mean?

336
00:25:15.545 --> 00:25:19.170
Could I say no?
- Could you say...


337
00:25:20.795 --> 00:25:25.961
Bob. No. - Doris says I should
say "No" more...


338
00:25:26.086 --> 00:25:29.170
What the fuck does Doris have to
do with world security?


339
00:25:29.295 --> 00:25:32.128
She's my cleaner.
- I know who she is.


340
00:25:35.295 --> 00:25:40.503
And finally... the hot dog.
- <i>Yeah, I like that</i>.


341
00:25:40.628 --> 00:25:43.253
Okay, I'll do the handshake one.

342
00:25:45.336 --> 00:25:51.045
Next Tuesday, I promise. I promise.
It's just... my work...


343
00:25:53.878 --> 00:25:58.336
You're being a lot more understanding
than I expected, I actually thought
you'd be angrier.


344
00:25:59.003 --> 00:26:02.545
It's just... I have to do it.
Apparently.


345
00:26:04.961 --> 00:26:08.086
No, I can't keep messing you around,
it's not all, it's not alright,


346
00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:11.211
It's not alright. 
It isn't alright.

347
00:26:12.336 --> 00:26:17.211
Do you know what, June?
We're going to have this date.


348
00:26:24.878 --> 00:26:29.253
Hello, June? No, we didn't get cut off,
I hung up.


349
00:26:29.378 --> 00:26:31.961
No, no, no, you hadn't
done anything wrong.


350
00:26:32.086 --> 00:26:35.628
No, I should have said goodby. I should
have said goodby, I was being dramatic.


351
00:26:35.753 --> 00:26:37.920
I was being dramatic, it was stupid.
I should've...


352
00:26:38.045 --> 00:26:41.336
I should've said goodby, But I thought
I'd hang up, and then I'd go and do...


353
00:26:41.461 --> 00:26:44.545
And then to go and do something,
and then maybe, maybe I could see you.


354
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.378
Okay, you go when I...
Okay, Bye!


355
00:26:47.503 --> 00:26:51.420
Okay. No, it doesn't matter.Okay.
Bye! Okay. Um...
Uh.


356
00:26:52.336 --> 00:26:54.628
I'm not really wild about....

357
00:26:56.503 --> 00:27:00.461
I'm not doing it. - Oh, Bob. Okay...
- No. I'm saying No.


358
00:27:00.586 --> 00:27:04.016
Listen to me, Bob. She will wait.
-You heard me.
- I told you, I promise you she will...


359
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.040
Fucking, NO!

360
00:27:11.336 --> 00:27:16.461
I'm sorry I had to swear word with
that, that was unnecessary,
I'm very excited, but...


361
00:27:16.586 --> 00:27:19.795
Right, you don't know what you're
doing. Stop making a scene!


362
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.295
Doris, I did it! I said "No".
Yeah, it's Bob. Yeah.


363
00:27:24.961 --> 00:27:29.211
I'm going to take her to the
"Curry Cabin" and I'm going
to ask her lots of questions.


364
00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:40.087
Yes, sorry Doris. I hung up again,
I should've said goodby...


365
00:28:09.261 --> 00:28:12.962
Bob, you need to come! - How did you
find me? - I told you to come here!
Why is your phone off?


366
00:28:12.986 --> 00:28:15.986
You told me to turn my phone off!
- Why are you shouting at me?


367
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.623
Your mother fell. 
She hurt herself.

368
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:32.920
Ooh! What's that?

369
00:28:34.378 --> 00:28:40.628
You banged your head, Mum. - Did I?
That was silly of me. - Yeah, it was.


370
00:28:41.586 --> 00:28:43.686
Hi, Doris. 
- Hi.

371
00:28:44.461 --> 00:28:48.045
It's been too long. 
- Javier...

372
00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:53.170
I haven't shown you all my moves.
- I've seen enough of your moves.


373
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:02.295
You know what would make
me happy, don't you?


374
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.170
What's that, Mum?
- To see you with a nice girl.


375
00:29:05.295 --> 00:29:09.586
That's all I want. To see
you with a nice  girl.
- I know that's "all" you want.


376
00:29:09.711 --> 00:29:13.670
Then why won't you give it to me?
- Mum...
- I'll die sooner than you think.


377
00:29:13.795 --> 00:29:17.461
Mum, why do you always say that?
- I could die today.


378
00:29:17.586 --> 00:29:21.753
You know, it's horrible when you say
that! I really hate it. - Bob, if you
don't like touching women...


379
00:29:21.878 --> 00:29:26.295
Oh, come on! I touch women.
I touch women all the
time with my hands!


380
00:29:29.836 --> 00:29:31.936
Only when they ask.

381
00:29:33.128 --> 00:29:35.228
And when do them ask?

382
00:29:35.503 --> 00:29:37.603
They don't.
Um hmm.


383
00:29:38.253 --> 00:29:42.053
Naked and proud in front of
her, and I would say, "Doris..."


384
00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.040
Javier.
- Bob.


385
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.112
What are you doing? Mum, put that away!
- If you're never going to be with a
woman, then I may as well be dead!


386
00:29:51.136 --> 00:29:54.036
Mum, stop threatening to die!
This is exhausting!


387
00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.711
I do not want you to die. Give
me those pills, this is awful!


388
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:01.016
- If you would just be with a girl...
- I'm with a girl! I'm with a girl!
I'm with a girl!


389
00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.016
Really? - Yes, I promise. I'm with a
girl. I'm with a girl, And she's great,
and you'd love her.


390
00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:10.840
Who is she? - she's um... it's um...
Doris! It's Doris. - Yes?
- Oh, Good! I love Doris!


391
00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.940
Okay then it's not Doris.
- It's Doris!  - What?


392
00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:16.040
My favorite girl in the world!
- Okay, wait...


393
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:18.670
Why is she crying?
- Bob just told me the truth!


394
00:30:18.795 --> 00:30:22.253
What did you tell her?
- I told her something... Wait.


395
00:30:22.378 --> 00:30:25.378
I always wanted you to be with my Bob.
- I didn't know she would say this...


396
00:30:25.503 --> 00:30:28.495
I knew it would come this day.
- Doris, please...


397
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.711
I both love you so much.
- You've made me the happiest woman.


398
00:30:32.836 --> 00:30:37.711
Could I have a quick word? Just a quick
word, Doris. - Yes, Mrs. Kenner. -Doris...


399
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.995
No, I don't want to do it!
-It's not bad.
-It's bad, I don't want to lie.


400
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.120
How would she ever believe her only
son with such a whore? - Doris,


401
00:30:46.245 --> 00:30:51.128
She will find out! Why would I do this?
- Because I've never
seen her that happy.


402
00:30:51.253 --> 00:30:55.545
Ever. And she will forget,
in an... hour.


403
00:30:58.253 --> 00:31:00.420
So why can't we just make her happy?

404
00:31:00.961 --> 00:31:03.061
Just for a moment.

405
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.020
Come on then!

406
00:31:19.753 --> 00:31:22.753
My Bobby and Doris are a couple.

407
00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.836
A la? People?

408
00:31:30.295 --> 00:31:38.295
Ladies and gentlemen, Sorry to interrupt
but we are of course here to celebrate
the 60th anniversary of Gladis and Ted.


409
00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.140
Well done, you two!

410
00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:48.331
Now, as a special treat,

411
00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:54.040
Doris, our Doris has said that
her new boyfriend SuperBob...


412
00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:59.540
No, me no believe it... is gonna
give a little speech.


413
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.040
Bobby.
- No, no, no, why would you do that?


414
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:24.540
Hiya.

415
00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.140
Gladys and...

416
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:37.623
Ted.

417
00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.957
You guys... I've seen you guys
over the last few years


418
00:32:43.295 --> 00:32:47.628
There you are! There you
are, and you look well


419
00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:55.836
Sixty years. That is a fucking long
time. I'm sorry, I don't know
why I'm swearing,


420
00:32:55.961 --> 00:32:59.753
That's twice today, that is very
out of character. I apologize.


421
00:32:59.878 --> 00:33:05.420
You're the sort of couple... that are
going to die...


422
00:33:06.661 --> 00:33:08.711
Very soon.

423
00:33:08.836 --> 00:33:11.086
After each other, after each other,

424
00:33:11.211 --> 00:33:16.795
But not like from cancer, or because,
like, you caught something off
the other one,


425
00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:21.253
but because, like, as soon as one of
you dies, the other one will be like,


426
00:33:22.545 --> 00:33:25.836
Ahh, ahh, My heart, I can't,
being crushed, I just...


427
00:33:25.961 --> 00:33:29.920
I've just, gone, sort of immed-
within a week.


428
00:33:32.878 --> 00:33:35.753
A mean, that's what we want, isn't it?

429
00:33:36.045 --> 00:33:38.711
Not for you to be
dead, not in any way,

430
00:33:38.836 --> 00:33:41.295
I mean, if your in pain, please,
go ahead, you know...


431
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:46.086
we'll be, we'll cope, but we'll
miss you, the point is, you
should stay, let's...


432
00:33:48.336 --> 00:33:50.753
That's what we all want, isn't it?

433
00:33:50.878 --> 00:33:55.086
To be with someone who,
when they die, you're like,


434
00:33:56.336 --> 00:33:59.378
"Well, that's it for me, too."

435
00:34:05.003 --> 00:34:11.045
Anyway, Happy Love Day! and,
and well done on 60 years


436
00:34:11.178 --> 00:34:14.945
And you weren't married at birth,
so you must be... old, so chin up!


437
00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:19.320
And thank you, for the music,
Cheers! and, good night.


438
00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:24.970
- Awful!
- I hate you.


439
00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.456
Very deep.
- Oh, when are you gonna
stop punishing me?


440
00:34:28.711 --> 00:34:31.628
I haven't decided yet.
- Thank you, Bob.


441
00:34:31.753 --> 00:34:35.670
Now, I'm joined in the studio today
by the American Senator Bill Jackson.


442
00:34:35.795 --> 00:34:39.378
Senator, you're in town for
today's weapon summit.


443
00:34:39.503 --> 00:34:42.545
What exactly is it that you're hoping
to achieve here in the UK, senator?


444
00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:46.136
I want to out an end to Britain's
monopoly on a highly dangerous weapon.


445
00:34:46.261 --> 00:34:49.628
Ah, but SuperBob isn't in fact
a weapon, is he? He's a man.


446
00:34:49.753 --> 00:34:52.961
The fact that he refused
to meet with me today,


447
00:34:53.086 --> 00:34:57.503
to shake my hand, with no
apology, or explanation,


448
00:34:57.670 --> 00:35:01.628
SuperBob is a weapon that Britain
has no control over.


449
00:35:01.753 --> 00:35:03.853
Where is he today?

450
00:35:20.961 --> 00:35:23.061
I don't like dancing.

451
00:35:24.003 --> 00:35:26.253
No, I don't have to...
- dance with your girlfriend!


452
00:35:26.378 --> 00:35:30.378
No, that's why we're a good couple,
She knows I don't dance.


453
00:35:34.003 --> 00:35:36.711
Is this... this is dancing, isn't it?

454
00:35:37.503 --> 00:35:40.628
No, come on. This is less embarrassing.

455
00:35:59.711 --> 00:36:02.603
Is it weird with Javier?
- Why?


456
00:36:02.728 --> 00:36:04.795
Because you use to go out.

457
00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:10.003
Why would it be weird? It was
months ago, it was just fun.


458
00:36:10.836 --> 00:36:12.961
You're probably disgusted.

459
00:36:14.128 --> 00:36:17.378
I am sorry. About what I said earlier.

460
00:36:17.711 --> 00:36:20.211
It's OK, you're not normal.

461
00:36:20.586 --> 00:36:26.170
I'm just jealous. Maybe I
wish I could be more like you.


462
00:36:26.628 --> 00:36:28.728
You already apologized.

463
00:36:29.753 --> 00:36:32.503
What's this? 
- It's the psychic paper.

464
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:35.086
Oh, the psychic paper, is it?

465
00:36:35.286 --> 00:36:39.486
"Doris is better than I will ever be.
I am sorry I was ever rude to her,


466
00:36:39.611 --> 00:36:42.503
She's the greatest, I am
an idiot, Bob Kenner."


467
00:36:42.628 --> 00:36:44.711
That's interesting.

468
00:36:44.836 --> 00:36:49.086
Yeah. How come your English
is so much better on paper?


469
00:38:28.295 --> 00:38:31.545
It's June. I should take this.

470
00:38:31.878 --> 00:38:34.420
Tell her you dance
like a fucking idiot.


471
00:38:34.545 --> 00:38:37.003
Hello? June...

472
00:38:42.378 --> 00:38:47.461
No, I honestly, I waited for ages,
then I had to go because my Mum, and...


473
00:38:47.586 --> 00:38:49.686
So it was broken?

474
00:38:50.045 --> 00:38:53.670
Well, of course. Of course
I'm still keen,


475
00:38:54.045 --> 00:38:56.670
I'm too keen, I'm...

476
00:38:58.295 --> 00:39:01.628
I've been making you something.
It's embarrassing.


477
00:39:03.461 --> 00:39:07.128
Yeah, you could see it, if you want.
It's at my house.


478
00:39:10.253 --> 00:39:15.461
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that would be great.

479
00:39:15.961 --> 00:39:18.061
That's a great idea.

480
00:39:18.961 --> 00:39:21.545
Okay, you come to my house. For dinner.

481
00:39:23.586 --> 00:39:26.170
All right. I'm a tremendous cook.

482
00:39:27.003 --> 00:39:32.086
Okay. see you later.
All right. Goodbye.


483
00:39:41.836 --> 00:39:43.961
We are joined now by Theresa Ford

484
00:39:44.086 --> 00:39:47.886
Head of the Global Emergency Response
Department at the Ministry of Defense.


485
00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:52.295
Theresa, do you really thing that
SuperBob... Excuse me, why won't
SuperBob shake my hand?


486
00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.586
Does he hold a grudge
against the United States?


487
00:39:54.711 --> 00:39:58.378
SuperBob does not hold any
resentment against anyone.


488
00:39:58.503 --> 00:40:00.795
He is a very warm and kind man.

489
00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.586
You have no control over SuperBob.
- Of course I do.


490
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:09.711
All right, where was he today?
- He was resting, Senator Jackson,
in accordance...


491
00:40:09.836 --> 00:40:16.211
SuperBob hates America. - SuperBob
does not hate America,
SuperBob loves America.


492
00:40:16.336 --> 00:40:19.086
He loves your country,
he loves your culture.


493
00:40:19.378 --> 00:40:22.253
Plinky plonky, country and western,
he can't get enough of it.


494
00:40:22.378 --> 00:40:26.586
You know, big shoulder pads.
American football.


495
00:40:26.711 --> 00:40:30.295
Men with cagey, head Helmut hats.

496
00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.920
Peanut butter and jelly.

497
00:40:34.086 --> 00:40:36.753
Yes, my Bob and
Doris are now a couple.

498
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.270
I do not believe it.

499
00:40:43.045 --> 00:40:47.336
Why is your Momma going around telling
everybody that you are a couple for?
You're not her type.


500
00:40:47.461 --> 00:40:54.003
Doris like the strong, assertive,
virile type. You know, the Javier type.


501
00:40:57.336 --> 00:41:00.628
Well, maybe I impressed her.

502
00:41:01.003 --> 00:41:03.420
Yes. How did you impress me?

503
00:41:05.753 --> 00:41:07.795
Without being arrogant,

504
00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.003
I am a superhero. 
I mean, that's...

505
00:41:11.128 --> 00:41:14.128
I never think of you as a superhero.
- You never think of me as a superhero?


506
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:17.503
Never.
- Okay, well, not that, then.


507
00:41:17.628 --> 00:41:21.545
So... how the two of you get together?

508
00:41:21.753 --> 00:41:26.461
Just the usual. Just...
Doris asked me out, and...


509
00:41:26.586 --> 00:41:28.670
I didn't ask you out! 
You asked me out.

510
00:41:28.795 --> 00:41:34.462
Oh I don't remember exactly, it doesn't
matter. -It doesn't matter?
Oh, come on, Bob, it's romantic.


511
00:41:34.961 --> 00:41:38.753
Bob has been obsessed with me for a
long time. - Obsessed is a strong word.


512
00:41:38.878 --> 00:41:40.878
Always watching me around the house.

513
00:41:41.003 --> 00:41:44.861
I'm always waiting for me to pick up
something from the floor so
he could look at my ass.


514
00:41:44.986 --> 00:41:48.079
I wouldn't... I didn't do that
because I'm a feminist.
-When I say he likes my ass...


515
00:41:48.103 --> 00:41:50.296
I don't like you ass, I've never looked
at it. - You do not like her ass?


516
00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:55.295
Always watching me eat bananas.
- Have you seen her eat a banana?
She eats bananas with the skin on,


517
00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:59.753
Of course I watch, it's weird.
- And then after a few weeks I came in,


518
00:41:59.878 --> 00:42:02.795
and the whole house smells of
patchouli oil. Didn't it, Bob?


519
00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:08.503
Yep. - And Bob is standing
there in this big, pink, Ong.


520
00:42:08.628 --> 00:42:13.470
Was it one of mine? - What?
'E was like that when he was younger.
Always stealing my knickers.


521
00:42:13.595 --> 00:42:17.453
Mum, when are you going to let that go?
It was once, and I was four.


522
00:42:17.578 --> 00:42:21.745
It doesn't matter how old you were.
You still stole my knickers.
- I did not steal you knickers, Mum!


523
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:25.979
Why would you stole your mother's
knickers? - I didn't steal her knickers!
- Sounds like you stole her knickers.


524
00:42:26.003 --> 00:42:31.003
All right! I stole her knickers,
Is everyone happy? Can we move on?


525
00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:34.420
Do you feel better now, Bobby?
- Yes.


526
00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:38.295
So there we were, in the kitchen,
and I said to Doris...


527
00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.211
Four words.
- Four words.


528
00:42:41.628 --> 00:42:46.170
Four perfect words.
-Of course they were perfect, I said...


529
00:42:46.295 --> 00:42:48.395
I said...

530
00:42:49.378 --> 00:42:51.420
"You complete me, Doris."

531
00:42:51.545 --> 00:42:55.836
No, silly, that is from a film!
- From a film. I said, - Come on!
- I said... - What did you say?


532
00:42:55.961 --> 00:42:59.586
I said, "Nobody puts Baby..."
I didn't say that, it sounds a git,


533
00:42:59.711 --> 00:43:04.253
I said, "I love your face.
I love your face!"


534
00:43:04.378 --> 00:43:09.336
That is what said. Because it
was poignant. - Isn't he adorable?
- He's not my type.


535
00:43:24.878 --> 00:43:29.003
We have a major accident with multiple
vehicles on the A205 westbound


536
00:43:29.128 --> 00:43:31.228
Answer, please.

537
00:43:36.045 --> 00:43:38.211
Multiple vehicles, multiple injured.

538
00:43:38.336 --> 00:43:40.436
I'd better...

539
00:43:51.878 --> 00:43:55.420
Senator Jackson, I have complete
control over Bob's movements.


540
00:43:55.545 --> 00:43:57.911
You have no
- I know where he is, at all times.


541
00:43:58.036 --> 00:44:04.295
I'm terribly sorry to have to interrupt
you there, but we're getting reports
of a large car crash in South London,


542
00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.086
SuperBob is actually reported to be
on the scene. Which if true, Theresa,


543
00:44:08.211 --> 00:44:14.128
would be a direct contravention
of his UN sanctioned Tuesday
day off. Would it not?


544
00:44:14.253 --> 00:44:18.211
Well, it would if, if...
- Well, it would, wouldn't it?


545
00:44:18.336 --> 00:44:24.003
This, this is exactly what I am talking
about, - I have to go... - He is not
allowed to... - Start the bloody chopper!


546
00:44:25.378 --> 00:44:27.795
He is not allowed to work on Tuesdays!

547
00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:32.545
Rogue WMD. We are at their mercy.

548
00:44:36.253 --> 00:44:38.353
Help, please!

549
00:44:39.336 --> 00:44:44.920
She's got a puncture to her left lung.
-Get out of here now. This has nothing
to do with the MOD.


550
00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.936
I can help. - You cannot work on
your day off, that is the law.


551
00:44:50.061 --> 00:44:52.961
You have to be seen to be
following orders. Bob!


552
00:44:57.003 --> 00:45:00.378
Do not disobey your government.

553
00:45:03.628 --> 00:45:06.545
Do not disobey <i>me</i>, Bob.

554
00:45:07.461 --> 00:45:09.961
Walk. Away.

555
00:45:10.336 --> 00:45:14.253
Help me! Please, help me!
- Don't do it, Bob.


556
00:45:40.336 --> 00:45:42.436
It's OK.

557
00:45:43.711 --> 00:45:45.811
It's all right.

558
00:46:47.211 --> 00:46:51.795
He just let that woman die.
He doesn't have psychic powers,
Senator. He's just a man.


559
00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.086
He is not just a man.

560
00:46:55.211 --> 00:46:58.961
He has these powers and they
should be used in the right way.


561
00:46:59.086 --> 00:47:04.128
You people are sitting on the
greatest discovery of this century
and you  are squandering it.


562
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:09.961
Why is Great Britain allowed an
unsanctioned WMD while the rest of us
just got to sit around and wait and see


563
00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.040
what he is gonna snap?

564
00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.940
Bob...
- Sorry, I forgot my keys.


565
00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.998
No, no, that's fine. I was in
the area buying lemons.


566
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.229
Listen, I didn't get them,
when we were in the care home


567
00:47:32.253 --> 00:47:35.828
Javier got into this big argument with
Tomas for waking him up for lunch.


568
00:47:35.953 --> 00:47:38.503
That is because he has his clock fast.

569
00:47:38.628 --> 00:47:41.211
And then when we gave him
the food, he said...


570
00:47:41.336 --> 00:47:44.420
He complained about the food, he said
he would only eat cake.


571
00:47:44.545 --> 00:47:47.003
But you know this makes
him hyperactive.


572
00:47:47.128 --> 00:47:52.920
Do you remember Nora? The one with the
harelip? She likes to be the one to
put out the cutlery.


573
00:47:53.253 --> 00:47:55.920
And the cutlery wasn't there.

574
00:47:56.753 --> 00:48:02.795
So, Nora went absolutely insane
And Javier was like,


575
00:48:04.211 --> 00:48:06.961
I have always emptied the dishwasher!

576
00:48:07.086 --> 00:48:10.336
There is no reason to believe I would
forget to do it this afternoon!


577
00:48:10.461 --> 00:48:14.461
Why? Why today? Explain to me
why today I would have forgotten it.


578
00:48:14.628 --> 00:48:16.728
It was really tough today.

579
00:48:21.878 --> 00:48:23.978
Really tough.

580
00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:53.420
It's always tough.

581
00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:13.836
How ya, Barry? 
- Hi, Barry.

582
00:49:14.045 --> 00:49:16.545
I'll go and have a bath, then.

583
00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:27.920
Who is this?
- Shit, it's June.


584
00:49:29.003 --> 00:49:32.045
Why is she here?
- She's coming for dinner.


585
00:49:33.545 --> 00:49:35.645
Oh, I see.

586
00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:42.253
Go. - I'm going to... - To your room,
go to your room. You have to clean up.


587
00:49:45.686 --> 00:49:49.420
Barry, please get out, I have to
shower. -I ain't finished yet.


588
00:49:49.545 --> 00:49:52.295
Can you move up?

589
00:49:57.045 --> 00:49:59.295
Good evening, June.
- Hey.


590
00:49:59.628 --> 00:50:03.203
Welcome to Bob's house.
I'm Doris, I work here. -Hello.


591
00:50:03.328 --> 00:50:06.628
Please come in. Well come.
- Thank you.


592
00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:13.045
May I present, Bob Kenner.

593
00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.461
Doris, don't make a deal of it.

594
00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.211
You look really handsome. 
-Thank you.

595
00:50:21.795 --> 00:50:24.878
Hi. 
- Hi. How are you?

596
00:50:26.128 --> 00:50:30.170
Okay. I'll leave your papers there.
Do you have your keys?


597
00:50:30.586 --> 00:50:34.770
Yep. -Do you need something?
- Nope.


598
00:50:35.628 --> 00:50:38.548
Oh, Mind the door! - Are you all right?
- Easy, I mind the door. I'm fine.


599
00:50:38.628 --> 00:50:42.503
Did you bang your head? - No, I'm fine.
Are you bleeding? - No, I'm fine.


600
00:50:42.628 --> 00:50:44.728
Have fun.

601
00:50:49.211 --> 00:50:51.311
You do look very nice.

602
00:50:51.836 --> 00:50:56.378
Thank you. So do you, you
look very... green.


603
00:50:57.086 --> 00:50:59.961
Green?
- like a good green.


604
00:51:00.086 --> 00:51:02.186
Okay.

605
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:04.795
Can you hang on a second?
Just one second.


606
00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:08.086
Yeah. - I promise I'll be quick.
- Okay.


607
00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.270
Okay.
- Okay.


608
00:51:22.878 --> 00:51:25.836
Let's do this.
Let's do a date.


609
00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:34.003
Right, you sit down...
Okay.


610
00:51:34.711 --> 00:51:37.503
Oh my God!
What's the smell?


611
00:51:38.045 --> 00:51:41.670
Okay, I'll open it. Ready?

612
00:51:52.836 --> 00:51:57.836
Ugh! Ugh! Is that manure?
- No, that... It's leaves.


613
00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:03.420
Right, leaves...
- And what they're made into.


614
00:52:06.878 --> 00:52:11.003
I do not know.
- Okay, why's it got windows?


615
00:52:11.170 --> 00:52:13.211
Are those windows? 
-Yeah.

616
00:52:13.336 --> 00:52:18.378
That looks like maggots. -No, that's
not a... That's a house. A house.


617
00:52:21.003 --> 00:52:23.103
House of leaves!

618
00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:27.270
The House of Leaves.

619
00:52:27.753 --> 00:52:29.853
The House of Leaves.

620
00:52:32.295 --> 00:52:34.395
I love it. 
- Good.

621
00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.336
Um-hm. I really love it,
it's very sweet..
- Good.


622
00:52:38.503 --> 00:52:42.336
Oh my God, I love it! - Great.
Why House of Leaves?


623
00:52:42.461 --> 00:52:46.328
It's your favorite book.
-My favorite book is "House of Cards".


624
00:52:46.453 --> 00:52:48.553
That is so much easier.

625
00:52:49.086 --> 00:52:52.003
That is, that is amazing.

626
00:52:54.628 --> 00:52:57.111
I'm glad you ate your noodles.

627
00:52:57.236 --> 00:53:00.378
You ate loads.
Look at how much you ate, here.


628
00:53:00.503 --> 00:53:04.086
You're gonna be full. Yeah.
- Very full.


629
00:53:04.211 --> 00:53:06.920
You're going to be bloated. 
-Yeah.

630
00:53:07.795 --> 00:53:10.711
Are you comfortable
with, like, farting?


631
00:53:11.503 --> 00:53:17.336
Excuse me? - You know, like, if I
winded you? - Like a baby? - Yeah.


632
00:53:17.795 --> 00:53:22.545
Uh.. I... No.
No, oh, you were joking. - Yeah.


633
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:25.503
That would really upset me.
- It really would upset me...


634
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:30.170
Okay. - I mean, not that much,
because I'd be totally cool with it,
if you wanted to, but...


635
00:53:30.295 --> 00:53:34.253
I really don't want you to wind me
like a baby and make me fart.


636
00:53:40.586 --> 00:53:45.295
I mean, it was everywhere, so we had to
cover the stain with a pile of books,


637
00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:49.170
But the guy he couldn't even
see anyway, so we totally
got away with it.


638
00:53:49.295 --> 00:53:52.420
Just. 
-That is amazing. 
-Yeah.

639
00:53:52.545 --> 00:53:56.086
That's crazy times.

640
00:54:03.628 --> 00:54:06.461
I have a cleaner for things like that.

641
00:54:07.545 --> 00:54:10.378
Yeah, you mentioned.

642
00:54:13.711 --> 00:54:15.920
What would you have used? 
- Me?

643
00:54:16.045 --> 00:54:19.628
If you had to? To get out the stain?
What would you have used?


644
00:54:21.086 --> 00:54:25.128
I don't know. - Okay.
Like a powder?


645
00:54:26.836 --> 00:54:29.045
Or a spray?

646
00:54:31.461 --> 00:54:34.961
Or mousse? A mousse thing?

647
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:42.253
You really can't get drunk?

648
00:54:42.586 --> 00:54:45.128
It's to do with my veins,
they are impervious.


649
00:54:45.253 --> 00:54:47.353
Impervious.
- Um hm.


650
00:54:48.295 --> 00:54:50.878
Im-perrrr-vious.

651
00:54:51.136 --> 00:54:54.003
Yeah. -I'm gonna get impervious
with you, you filthy animal.


652
00:54:54.128 --> 00:54:57.211
Can I get you some water?
Can I get you some of this?


653
00:54:57.461 --> 00:54:59.711
Ooh, I like your drapes.

654
00:55:04.253 --> 00:55:10.253
Bob! You are with British Gas!
Don't let those fuckers push
you around. Doris.


655
00:55:31.086 --> 00:55:33.186
June... 
- Yeah?

656
00:55:35.336 --> 00:55:38.336
You're a really lovely
woman, and you're beautiful.


657
00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.020
Thanks.

658
00:55:41.253 --> 00:55:44.045
You're not so bad yourself, SuperBob.

659
00:55:45.295 --> 00:55:48.420
I thought you were gonna
be one of those people


660
00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:51.461
who was like, above everyone else.

661
00:55:52.295 --> 00:55:55.336
You know. Because you can fly.

662
00:55:57.211 --> 00:56:02.003
But you're not. 
You're real, like me.

663
00:56:03.461 --> 00:56:06.211
Will you kiss me?
- I can't.


664
00:56:07.295 --> 00:56:12.361
Why? We already did.
-I'm sorry, I can't do this.
-Do what? It's just a kiss.


665
00:56:12.486 --> 00:56:15.786
I can't continue with this date,
it wouldn't be right.


666
00:56:15.911 --> 00:56:20.128
It's nothing that you've done. I don't
want to take advantage of you.


667
00:56:20.253 --> 00:56:23.128
I don't mind.
- I want to take advantage of Doris.


668
00:56:23.253 --> 00:56:26.670
I didn't mean it like that, I want...

669
00:56:28.211 --> 00:56:32.920
What I mean is, 
I want to be with

670
00:56:34.586 --> 00:56:36.686
Doris.

671
00:56:36.878 --> 00:56:39.045
Oh, just kiss her, you fucking plank.

672
00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:43.670
Barry, I didn't ask for your input.
- She's fit. - I like Doris.


673
00:56:43.795 --> 00:56:45.895
Very fit.

674
00:56:46.086 --> 00:56:49.336
Where have you been all night?
- I'm keeping me eye on the gnomes.


675
00:56:49.461 --> 00:56:53.211
I didn't know I had gnomes.
- Yeah, you've got two.


676
00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:57.711
June, listen.
- Bob, what I...


677
00:56:59.461 --> 00:57:01.753
Oh my god. They're here.

678
00:57:01.878 --> 00:57:04.628
Who's here?
- Uh, How does my hair look?


679
00:57:04.753 --> 00:57:10.503
Your hair looks fine, why? Who's here?
- Shoes. Ok Ok.


680
00:57:11.211 --> 00:57:13.920
Good evening, Bob.
- Hello. - June...


681
00:57:14.045 --> 00:57:18.085
Now, have you finished all your
paperwork? - Let's go, darling,
let's get you dressed. - Darling? -Off!


682
00:57:18.128 --> 00:57:21.008
Are we going somewhere? - Oh yes.
Why is she calling me darling? Sorry...


683
00:57:21.045 --> 00:57:24.753
I just... didn't I just say something?
- Don't mind me - You didn't hear.


684
00:57:25.211 --> 00:57:29.753
Okay. His hands are down my pants,
why is that happening?
-Just enjoy it, babe.


685
00:57:29.878 --> 00:57:33.170
Why am I wearing this? - It's the
internationally approved uniform, Bob.


686
00:57:33.295 --> 00:57:38.295
They approved this? -Yes. - Were they
blindfolded? - We have to show willing,
okay, it's time to make ties.


687
00:57:38.878 --> 00:57:41.920
Yes. I'm aware it sounds strange. She
told me not to make it to that lunch.


688
00:57:42.045 --> 00:57:45.562
Theresa told you not to come?
-That you wouldn't make it, and
that we would go to this thing tonight.


689
00:57:45.586 --> 00:57:47.998
Okay so I don't even know what this is.
I don't have time for any of this...


690
00:57:48.022 --> 00:57:51.003
I've got to do the most important
thing I've ever done.


691
00:57:51.128 --> 00:57:53.503
Teresa, why am I here?
- It doesn't matter.


692
00:57:53.628 --> 00:57:57.220
What's going on, why am I dressed
like a New Romantic?


693
00:57:57.345 --> 00:58:01.386
June told me you stopped her from coming
to lunch, she told me everything.


694
00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:03.545
Yes, I have pulled a
lot of strings today,


695
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:07.445
Do you have any idea the nightmare
your "No" stunt has caused me?


696
00:58:07.570 --> 00:58:10.045
Theresa, we need to talk about this.

697
00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:15.253
I spoke to June, yes. For the greater
good, okay? And it's all fine.


698
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:17.753
Is it?

699
00:58:17.878 --> 00:58:24.378
Oh, Bob. We're good at this.
This is what we do.


700
00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:28.270
We save the world.

701
00:58:41.575 --> 00:58:44.086
Bob, this is Xiang Chao
from the Chinese Senate.


702
00:58:44.211 --> 00:58:47.303
He's here to talk about a set-down
on nuclear policies.


703
00:58:47.428 --> 00:58:49.628
Nice to meet you. Yeah, ciao.
- I'm pleased to.


704
00:58:49.753 --> 00:58:52.545
George Pardumo from Greece.
- Please to meet you..


705
00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:55.045
Yeah, it's nice to....

706
00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:59.336
Theresa, this is not an explanation.
- Dane Abudaui.


707
00:58:59.795 --> 00:59:04.711
Hello, Dane. - Are you in a mood?
-Yeah, I'm in a mood, because
you told me... - Dallas Tango.


708
00:59:04.836 --> 00:59:07.716
What? - Super to meet you - Nice to
meet you. - What do you mean, "what"?


709
00:59:07.753 --> 00:59:11.170
This is the French Senator
Eleusi Savoir.


710
00:59:11.711 --> 00:59:15.586
Enchante. - We knew that you liked
June, Bob. It was obvious to anyone


711
00:59:15.711 --> 00:59:19.211
All that hanging around the library...
- So you manipulated it. - I did not. No.


712
00:59:19.336 --> 00:59:24.086
She really does like you, just
take a look. - It's true, I do.
-Are you all right?


713
00:59:24.586 --> 00:59:26.670
There's nothing sinister
going on here, Bob.


714
00:59:26.795 --> 00:59:30.128
I just needed to make
sure that she was OK.
I'm just looking out for you.


715
00:59:30.253 --> 00:59:33.878
It's not looking out for
me if you make her go
out with me. It's not real.


716
00:59:34.003 --> 00:59:36.028
You are sounding paranoid.

717
00:59:36.153 --> 00:59:40.253
Well, she did ask me to ask you out.
But I would have asked you out anyway.


718
00:59:40.378 --> 00:59:44.929
Stand down, June, just stand down and
smile. -Oh so there you go Theresa this
has to stop. I need my own life back.


719
00:59:44.953 --> 00:59:48.211
This is the dignitary from
Rome, Giuseppe Kotelo.


720
00:59:48.711 --> 00:59:52.628
Good evening. - Bona Sera.
- Thank you.


721
00:59:52.753 --> 00:59:58.211
I really think you should give June
chance she really does have an awful
lot to recommend her. - I want Doris.


722
00:59:58.503 --> 01:00:03.086
What? -My cleaner.
- I know who she is, Bob.


723
01:00:03.211 --> 01:00:05.586
Come and shake the hand...
- Don't. Never mind.


724
01:00:05.753 --> 01:00:10.628
I've decided. If she will let me,
I want to be with Doris.


725
01:00:10.795 --> 01:00:15.128
Ah! This is Doris?
- No, this is not Doris. -Yes!


726
01:00:18.836 --> 01:00:22.628
Doris is from Colombia. You just
can't be with anyone from Colombia.


727
01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:24.961
Why not? 
-It's complicated.

728
01:00:25.628 --> 01:00:28.795
And she's a cleaner.
It's really not the right narrative.


729
01:00:29.545 --> 01:00:33.461
You should be with June.
June's fun. And she's American.


730
01:00:33.586 --> 01:00:36.420
But I don't want to be with June.
- Bob, she's right there.


731
01:00:36.545 --> 01:00:39.545
It's fine, I've told her.
- It's fine.


732
01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:43.878
Are you all right? - Okay, you don't
have to be with her, Bob.


733
01:00:44.003 --> 01:00:49.586
You just have to stand near her
sometimes. It's what we need.
-Who is "we"?


734
01:00:49.711 --> 01:00:55.336
The United Kingdom. Great Britain.
The MOD. You. All of us.


735
01:00:55.461 --> 01:01:00.628
Now you need to start listening to me
again. It was a very bad decision you
made not to shake hands with the Senator.


736
01:01:00.753 --> 01:01:03.170
Alexis Sanjiv, this is SuperBob.

737
01:01:03.295 --> 01:01:07.086
Okay so that’s what this is about.
All right. Okay, thank you.


738
01:01:07.753 --> 01:01:10.628
Sometimes saving the world isn't
about flying into danger,


739
01:01:10.753 --> 01:01:13.503
Sometimes it's about making
sacrifices of your own.


740
01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:16.545
Do you have any idea the
sacrifices I've made?


741
01:01:16.961 --> 01:01:21.336
Let's go. - June! Seriously. I do not
know how I could make this any
clearer. This is weird.


742
01:01:21.461 --> 01:01:26.295
Do I not get to have love? -June, could
you just give us a moment please?
-Yes, of course.


743
01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:30.628
Let's talk about Doris. 
-Please.

744
01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:35.545
Do you know what is right for her?
-Yes. -Not you, what's right for Doris.
-Yes, of course I do.


745
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:38.045
What does she want, Bob? 
-She wants...

746
01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:42.753
She wants a nursery in Colombia,
that is what she's always wanted.


747
01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:48.078
And this is Colonel Matayzu.

748
01:01:48.203 --> 01:01:51.711
Bob, Bob, Bob...
It is an honor to meet you.


749
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:57.420
We are so looking forward to having
your help in combating the uprising
in our country.


750
01:01:57.545 --> 01:02:02.712
Why am I here, Theresa? - Bob,
what do you think this
Weapons Summit is about?


751
01:02:04.711 --> 01:02:09.045
I hadn't seen that. - You're the only
weapon anyone cares about.


752
01:02:10.836 --> 01:02:13.295
And this is Senator Jackson.

753
01:02:13.961 --> 01:02:19.670
Bob Kenner! I am so pleased
you've decided to play ball, and


754
01:02:20.295 --> 01:02:25.295
Obviously I'm delighted to hear
about your union to this lovely
American lady.


755
01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:29.878
Is this the man who needed
a handshake earlier today?


756
01:02:30.003 --> 01:02:32.378
Well, yeah, but we're all good now.

757
01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:38.920
Ha, ha, ha, yeah, right. So, wait -
So all of this, all of this is so you
can have a handshake?


758
01:02:40.878 --> 01:02:42.978
Is that right?

759
01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:47.228
Okay.

760
01:02:47.878 --> 01:02:49.920
Ha, ha, ha, there ya go.

761
01:02:50.045 --> 01:02:52.053
Was it worth it?

762
01:02:52.178 --> 01:02:56.178
Hey, I am so glad we could sort
out that Colombia situation.


763
01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:00.836
What Colombia situation?
-Your cleaner.


764
01:03:01.128 --> 01:03:06.920
We bought her a nursery!
And a first class ticket for
Bogotá, next flight.


765
01:03:11.086 --> 01:03:15.211
You sent her away?
- It's what you wanted, right?


766
01:03:16.253 --> 01:03:20.003
Are you joking? - I thought you said
you wanted what was right for her, Bob.


767
01:03:20.128 --> 01:03:23.545
Hey, he wants what's right for all
of us, don't you, Bob?


768
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:26.670
Yeah. Just like you wanted a handshake.

769
01:03:26.795 --> 01:03:31.378
Hey, everybody is here to broker a real
sweet deal for you, Bob.


770
01:03:31.503 --> 01:03:34.295
This is gonna be a lot of money
in it for you.


771
01:03:34.503 --> 01:03:38.920
I'm just shaking your hand.
Just like you wanted.


772
01:03:39.295 --> 01:03:43.586
Bob. - And SuperBob, our very
own Bob Kenner is here today...


773
01:03:43.711 --> 01:03:46.045
Is this the handshake you wanted?

774
01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:50.003
Bob Kenner! Put Senator
Jackson down now!


775
01:03:50.461 --> 01:03:53.711
It is supposed to be my day off!

776
01:04:00.053 --> 01:04:03.395
I don't care if you bring him down
or not, just shoot the bastard!


777
01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:07.070
Unconfirmed reports are coming in about
an explosion at the Ministry of Defense.


778
01:04:07.195 --> 01:04:09.304
The explosion at the Ministry of
Defense was caused by SuperBob...


779
01:04:09.328 --> 01:04:12.253
London is tonight on high alert
as SuperBob...


780
01:04:12.378 --> 01:04:16.970
Police and military forces around the
world are combining their efforts
to track down SuperBob.


781
01:04:17.095 --> 01:04:19.328
We have not lost
control of SuperBob.


782
01:04:19.453 --> 01:04:21.828
Everyone is to stay calm,
and not jump to conclusions.


783
01:04:21.953 --> 01:04:24.711
Right. So, where exactly is he?
- I can't tell you that.


784
01:04:24.836 --> 01:04:29.211
There've been unconfirmed sightings of
SuperBob in New York, Tokyo, Bogotá...


785
01:04:30.628 --> 01:04:34.670
I'm looking for somebody, her
name is Doris. She'll be on a
flight from England.


786
01:04:34.795 --> 01:04:38.086
Uh, what is her last name?
- Ohhh... that is something
I should know.


787
01:04:40.586 --> 01:04:44.711
My Mum would know. Can I call my Mum?
Guh! I know where she is!


788
01:04:45.295 --> 01:04:48.729
My man said he heard mumbling about
someone called Morris.
- ...said he was screaming "Forrest!"


789
01:04:48.753 --> 01:04:52.586
apparently asking for a Florist.
- is, or what he would do next.


790
01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:57.753
Tensions between the United Kingdom
and the United States of America
have never been higher.


791
01:04:57.878 --> 01:05:02.878
The Ecuadoran Embassy has offered
SuperBob political asylum.
-Stay in your homes, try to hide.


792
01:05:03.003 --> 01:05:08.336
Whatever he has planned, it could
spell disaster for us all.


793
01:05:10.128 --> 01:05:14.128
Doris. We're meant to be together.

794
01:05:15.836 --> 01:05:19.461
I don't even feel like I have to
say it, because I feel like
you probably know.


795
01:05:19.586 --> 01:05:22.670
'Cause I know, and I think
I've probably always known.


796
01:05:23.495 --> 01:05:26.553
The MOD is assuring the public
that SuperBob is not dangerous.


797
01:05:26.678 --> 01:05:31.146
The British government asking the
public to remain calm. -Military
helicopters  are at high alert,


798
01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:35.003
ready to strike... -Peckham High
Street, where he allegedly
bought a Wham Bar.


799
01:05:35.128 --> 01:05:39.295
I do, I do love your face. I said it
before and it sounded like a joke,


800
01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.295
But I mean it. I like your face,
I like what it does.


801
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:47.753
I like what it has to say, and you know
I like everything with the face,


802
01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:51.170
I wouldn't want a face in a jar,
just looking at me...


803
01:05:51.753 --> 01:05:54.628
A huge number of witnesses report
seeing SuperBob landing in Peckham


804
01:05:54.753 --> 01:05:58.146
Police are heading towards the
Peckham area. - someone claims
he was eating a Wham Bar.


805
01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:01.545
The international man hunt is zeroing
in on Peckham. - South London.


806
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:05.545
The Prime Minister has asked
for SuperBob to surrender
himself immediately.


807
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:09.170
Okay, don't say any of that.
No not. Don't open your mouth,


808
01:06:09.295 --> 01:06:15.170
Just... just walk in, and...
try and kiss her.


809
01:06:18.003 --> 01:06:21.878
The MOD has described it
as a diplomatic nightmare.


810
01:06:22.003 --> 01:06:27.086
Authorities say that if Kenner
can not be stopped, he can at
least be contained.


811
01:06:27.211 --> 01:06:32.628
Doris! - You came to see me again!
- What? No, I haven't come to see
you, Mum. - Charming.


812
01:06:32.753 --> 01:06:36.521
What are you doing here, Bob?
Where's June? -Why are you asking
me about June? I'm here to see you.


813
01:06:36.545 --> 01:06:40.003
You came to see me. - I haven't come to
see you, Mum. I already saw you today!


814
01:06:40.128 --> 01:06:44.253
A short while ago security cameras
caught SuperBob arriving outside
of his Mother's care home.


815
01:06:44.378 --> 01:06:46.470
The authorities have been mobilized.

816
01:06:46.595 --> 01:06:50.237
I went all the way to Colombia, then I
went to the airport, there were no
flights to Colombia tonight.


817
01:06:50.261 --> 01:06:55.003
I know. - I know you know, that's why
you're here! -A large crowd has
gathered outside the care home...


818
01:06:55.128 --> 01:06:58.378
And it appears local residents are not
letting the authorities inside.


819
01:06:58.503 --> 01:07:04.336
SuperBob has been very good to us,
right? After all he's done to us, he's
a Peckham People. Peckham People!


820
01:07:04.461 --> 01:07:07.586
A Gospel choir has formed a human
shield around the care home...


821
01:07:07.711 --> 01:07:11.378
It's a stand-off. In Peckham.
- What is all this trouble?


822
01:07:11.503 --> 01:07:13.795
This trouble? It's because of you.

823
01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:17.128
Don't bring me into your mess, Bob.
I am nothing to do with your mess.


824
01:07:17.253 --> 01:07:19.795
If you think I'm responsible
for any of this,


825
01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:25.086
then you are very disrespectful
of me, of my culture...
-Doris, please! Shut up for a minute!


826
01:07:25.211 --> 01:07:31.295
He's been hiding inside, I'm going to
try to get in there, see if I can have
a chat or a word with him.


827
01:07:32.128 --> 01:07:35.128
I've come here to be nice to you.

828
01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.086
I need to tell you something.

829
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:48.795
Hey, Bob. 
-You know Javier.

830
01:07:49.378 --> 01:07:53.711
Yeah. -Javier just...
- Good to see you again.


831
01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:57.670
Hey, Javi. Do you work
and night shift as well?


832
01:07:58.378 --> 01:08:02.420
No Bob. Maybe you will understand this.

833
01:08:03.878 --> 01:08:07.420
I found out Doris was going
to leave for Colombia,


834
01:08:07.545 --> 01:08:11.628
And I realized something I
think I've always known.


835
01:08:13.253 --> 01:08:15.836
We are meant to be together.

836
01:08:16.336 --> 01:08:20.003
And I know it. Doris knows it.
All of Peckham knows it,


837
01:08:20.128 --> 01:08:24.045
It's so blindingly obvious, it
was staring me in the face.


838
01:08:24.336 --> 01:08:27.545
And I spent too long just
doing what I was told,


839
01:08:27.711 --> 01:08:33.253
Scared to say "No" to anything.
Scared to... stand up for myself.


840
01:08:35.586 --> 01:08:40.545
And then I heard that she was
leaving and I thought now is
the time for me to say "No".


841
01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:45.378
No, Doris. I do
not want you to leave.

842
01:08:47.503 --> 01:08:50.961
I want you here.
With me.


843
01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.878
Do you understand this, Bob?
- Yeah, I have some idea, yeah.


844
01:08:57.586 --> 01:09:02.003
After all, I love your face.
- oh, fuck off.


845
01:09:03.711 --> 01:09:06.836
Is Bob inside? - Yes, he is inside.
- Okay, what's he doing in there?


846
01:09:06.961 --> 01:09:09.878
None of your business,
it's something important.


847
01:09:10.836 --> 01:09:15.253
That's great news, congratulations.
- Thank you, Bob.


848
01:09:19.336 --> 01:09:24.961
Well I don't know why I'm hanging
around here, he loves your face.
This is stupid, I should go. -Bob.


849
01:09:25.086 --> 01:09:29.586
What? 
- What did you want to say to me?

850
01:09:36.545 --> 01:09:41.253
I just wanted to say goodbye.
- Goodbye, Bob.


851
01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.086
Thank you. For everything.

852
01:09:50.628 --> 01:09:52.728
Goodbye. 
-Goodbye.

853
01:10:24.503 --> 01:10:28.461
Okay.
Okay.


854
01:10:33.003 --> 01:10:35.103
Okay.

855
01:10:37.003 --> 01:10:39.753
I think that's enough goodbye.

856
01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:50.253
Oh, good to catch up, Bob. Take care.

857
01:10:51.045 --> 01:10:54.586
What did you want to say to me?
- I think you should go.


858
01:10:54.711 --> 01:10:57.128
What?
- To Colombia, I think you should go.


859
01:10:57.253 --> 01:11:00.253
You see, this is why I love you. Doris
I would never want you to leave.


860
01:11:00.378 --> 01:11:04.586
For the kids. You were supposed
to be working with children,
you have a gift for it.


861
01:11:04.711 --> 01:11:08.551
How do you know that, you have
never seen me with a child?
-You looked after me for three years.


862
01:11:08.586 --> 01:11:11.045
You want me to go? 
-Yeah.

863
01:11:11.795 --> 01:11:17.211
But... I could come with you.
- How?


864
01:11:17.461 --> 01:11:20.495
I can fly faster than a speeding
bullet, I can work from anywhere.


865
01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:24.378
You know what, I could come with you,
I have family there. That's easier, Doris.


866
01:11:24.503 --> 01:11:28.170
Maybe he's right. You
should help the kids.
-He makes a good point.


867
01:11:28.295 --> 01:11:31.503
We can get a house.
I could work from there. -True.


868
01:11:31.628 --> 01:11:35.211
Yes, but the visa application...
Oh, it's very impractical.


869
01:11:35.336 --> 01:11:39.970
I am resident, Doris, so...
much easier. - We should go.


870
01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:43.753
The MOD will not like it.
- Oh, fuck the MOD. - Language!


871
01:11:43.878 --> 01:11:47.878
You would do that for me?
-Take my hand.
- Mmm, not flying. -We'll walk.


872
01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:52.670
I'm very strong.
-I'm fuckin' invulnerable.
-But you see Doris, I am vulnerable.


873
01:11:52.795 --> 01:11:56.170
I can fly. -I have a nice car.
-I hate flying. -She hates the flying.


874
01:11:56.295 --> 01:11:59.961
I'm gonna kill you, mate.
.. Let's go.


875
01:12:01.336 --> 01:12:05.170
Ah, my bag. -Ai, cabrone!
-I'm so sorry, Javier, I've been
crushing hands all day.


876
01:12:05.295 --> 01:12:07.729
That is really unlike me, that was
out of order. You seem like a nice man.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Kenner.


877
01:12:07.753 --> 01:12:12.461
I wish you all the best,
we are gonna go. -Good.
-I love you, Mum. -I love you too.


878
01:12:12.586 --> 01:12:17.336
Bye, Ted. - And you know what would
make me happy, don't you?
-What's that, Mum? -Grandchildren!


879
01:12:17.461 --> 01:12:21.544
Oh, God. The one thing I don't
need in bed is more pressure.


880
01:12:23.878 --> 01:12:26.086
Is the Jamaican girl still here?

881
01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:36.711
A whistle blower within the MOD has
stated that no one in the department
has any idea what SuperBob will do next


882
01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:42.295
The MOD strenuously
denying this allegation,


883
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:48.420
They insist that there is no reason
to panic but, for the time being,
he remains unaccounted for.


884
01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:59.836
Why is Bob hiding? - He's not hiding.
He's doing something important that
does not concern you.


885
01:12:59.961 --> 01:13:03.503
The world waits to see what will
happen when SuperBob emerges.


886
01:13:03.628 --> 01:13:09.503
All of you, all of you just take
liberties, and you come in here
to exploit SuperBob.


887
01:13:11.170 --> 01:13:16.503
The people of Peckham they are
blocking all the doors to the care
home here, as you can see,


888
01:13:16.628 --> 01:13:20.420
and failing to allow any
of the authorities inside.


889
01:13:38.711 --> 01:13:41.211
Okay. So.

890
01:13:44.878 --> 01:13:48.253
What are you doing? Jesus Christ,
that is very dangerous!


891
01:13:48.628 --> 01:13:51.670
I'm really sorry. - I'm invincible,
what do you think you're doing?


892
01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:54.086
That is really dangerous.
There are children about!


893
01:13:54.211 --> 01:13:57.086
I'm sorry everyone. Really sorry.
I've thrown the whole mood down.


894
01:13:57.211 --> 01:14:00.878
Don't fire a gun... Why is all this?
It's a complete waste of money.


895
01:14:01.836 --> 01:14:05.086
This is ruined. 
I sleep in this!

896
01:14:05.253 --> 01:14:07.353
You all look very foolish.

897
01:14:07.711 --> 01:14:11.211
There's something very important
I have to say, if you don't mind.


898
01:14:13.128 --> 01:14:17.753
I am resigning from the MOD.
I am going freelance.


899
01:14:18.086 --> 01:14:20.795
I am no longer the property of Britain.

900
01:14:21.461 --> 01:14:25.545
And there's gonna be no more forms.
No more fucking forms.


901
01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:29.211
There, I said it. I don't like forms,
alight? There's going to be
none of them. What?


902
01:14:29.336 --> 01:14:33.753
Self-assessment forms. -What's it
-You go freelance you have to use
self-assessment forms.


903
01:14:33.878 --> 01:14:38.087
Are you serious? Right. There's going
to be one form. There's going to be
one form, but that doesn't matter.


904
01:14:38.111 --> 01:14:40.229
You don't need to worry about it.
That's not really the point.
The point is, look...


905
01:14:40.253 --> 01:14:46.086
If any of you are in trouble, and
you need help, contact me and
I will help you.


906
01:14:46.211 --> 01:14:49.920
I don't know how you contact me,
we used to have a system when
I was with the MOD,


907
01:14:50.045 --> 01:14:55.212
Now we don't have, so... maybe
we have a thing that flashes,
like a red and, uh...


908
01:14:56.170 --> 01:15:01.336
Okay, fuck it! 07700900249.
That's my number. All right?


909
01:15:01.836 --> 01:15:08.045
You can call me and I will help you. But
don't abuse the - it's already ringing.


910
01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:12.045
Okay. I will not deliver pizzas,
I'm saying that on live TV.


911
01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:15.128
That is off the table.
I would like some time off.


912
01:15:20.795 --> 01:15:23.253
Someone very special in my life.

913
01:15:24.878 --> 01:15:27.711
I would like to
try and make her happy.

914
01:15:30.086 --> 01:15:35.920
If any of you are in trouble
and need you need help, you call me.


915
01:15:37.253 --> 01:15:39.353
And I will save you.

916
01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:44.836
I am not a civil servant.
I'm SuperBob.


917
01:15:50.003 --> 01:15:52.103
Doris...

918
01:15:54.045 --> 01:15:56.145
Let's go.

919
01:15:57.711 --> 01:15:59.811
Bob...

920
01:16:03.336 --> 01:16:05.436
Bye, Theresa.

921
01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.695
Hey! -Hi.
- How are you guys?


922
01:16:44.820 --> 01:16:46.836
Good, how are you? 
-Good.

923
01:16:46.961 --> 01:16:51.628
Great. You look really good.
-So do you. Growing a beard.
-Thank you.


924
01:16:53.586 --> 01:16:58.711
So here we are. Are you happy?
- Am I happy?


925
01:17:02.086 --> 01:17:06.669
We don't need words. We don't need
to see each other, to know.


926
01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.936
We... You know?

927
01:17:09.061 --> 01:17:14.336
We built a home together.
We've got a home that we live in.


928
01:17:15.878 --> 01:17:17.978
Am I happy?

929
01:17:19.211 --> 01:17:24.711
I have been moved to Afghanistan.
A relief. Very happy about that.


930
01:17:26.128 --> 01:17:30.545
You've no idea what my life was
like before, a constant firefight.


931
01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.628
Afghanistan, this is easy.

932
01:17:35.003 --> 01:17:37.003
This is a joy.

933
01:17:37.128 --> 01:17:41.795
This is a delight. 
They'll be fine.

934
01:17:49.295 --> 01:17:54.128
She's a nightmare. She literally never
shuts up, she doesn't stop talking.


935
01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:59.503
You have to send help, I can't take it
anymore. - What did you say? -Nothing.


936
01:18:00.753 --> 01:18:03.503
I will see these films, you know?
- Yeah.


937
01:18:04.211 --> 01:18:09.461
So why did you say something?
- 'Cause I'm an idiot?
-'Cause you are an idiot. -Okay.


938
01:18:09.586 --> 01:18:11.686
Come here.

939
01:18:17.253 --> 01:18:20.295
Hello? Okay, where are you?

940
01:18:20.961 --> 01:18:23.061
Hasta luego.

941
01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:32.003
Bye.
- Go. Save the world.


942
01:18:36.336 --> 01:18:38.436
Hi Barry.

943
01:19:14.836 --> 01:19:20.253
We're looking at the rock, Th
meteor if you like, that struck
Bob from Peckham Rye Park.


944
01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.670
It could hold the
key to his powers.


945
01:19:23.795 --> 01:19:28.086
If we find the answer to that,
there's no telling what we could do.


946
01:19:28.211 --> 01:19:32.544
Have you found anything?
- No. Six years, absolutely fuck-all.


947
01:19:32.795 --> 01:19:35.420
It might as well be a purple turd.

948
01:19:35.545 --> 01:19:41.836
So I had another accident at work,
and Bob turned up, and it was just
a superb experience.


949
01:19:43.753 --> 01:19:47.586
Got me out safely, lovely small talk,
made sure I was okay,


950
01:19:47.711 --> 01:19:53.628
Didn't have to fill in any forms,
and didn't stink of onions.
So, thank you, Bob.


951
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:58.295
Is he in there now? -No, he's
not in there now. - Sorry.


952
01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:02.128
I mean, it's a proverbial home. 
-I see.

953
01:20:02.378 --> 01:20:07.295
You know? I mean, who writes
your questions, man? -Sorry.


954
01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:11.670
So you got saved by Bob
again, what was that like?
-Yeah, I fell down a pothole.


955
01:20:11.795 --> 01:20:15.920
I got my leg trapped.
He came, was very swift.


956
01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:21.253
Utterly charming, affable,
looks great, and was just lovely.


957
01:20:21.753 --> 01:20:24.836
Just a really lovely experience.
I'm really happy.


958
01:20:26.003 --> 01:20:28.461
So got a little
thing for him, have you?

959
01:20:28.586 --> 01:20:33.086
I'm married.
- It's impressive you know SuperBob.


960
01:20:33.211 --> 01:20:38.794
Saw the bloke from "Birds of a Feather"
about three weeks ago just down
Stevenage Road.


961
01:20:39.586 --> 01:20:42.253
You know... just, whatever.

962
01:22:15.003 --> 01:22:19.586
Doesn't it fly by? Doesn't it?
Doesn't it though, like... whoosh.


963
01:22:22.586 --> 01:22:26.586
...
