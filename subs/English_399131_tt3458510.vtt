First prom with my dudes.

It's hot. I need something to drink.

36
00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:27.534
- Hello.
- Hello.


37
00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:28.586
Making you thirsty?

38
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.587
- Yeah.
- Okay.


39
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:31.671
- Having fun?
- Yeah, I'm having fun.


40
00:02:38.388 --> 00:02:42.016
- The fields, field of dreams.
- Yup.


41
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.393
And that's home base.

42
00:02:43.977 --> 00:02:46.062
- Did I get that right?
- No, that's the pitcher's...


43
00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:47.790
- That's the pitcher's mound.
- You don't have an idea.


44
00:02:47.814 --> 00:02:48.940
There is home base.

45
00:02:49.148 --> 00:02:51.484
- And that's where you stand?
- Yeah, yeah.


46
00:02:51.568 --> 00:02:53.448
Where all your dreams came true.

47
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:56.530
Yeah.

48
00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:02.912
Are you sad about graduating?

49
00:03:03.788 --> 00:03:06.332
Not really. Are you?

50
00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.710
Chloe and I are gonna come visit you...

51
00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:10.669
obviously.

52
00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:15.133
I'm just glad I have another year here.

53
00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:18.428
I can't imagine leaving this place.

54
00:03:20.346 --> 00:03:23.224
I think if you do it right,
it never really leaves you.


55
00:03:25.268 --> 00:03:27.520
Sorry, I just heard that
and threw up in my own mouth.


56
00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:32.692
I hope you're right.

57
00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:41.951
Hey! Come on. Limo's here.
Let's get some double-doubles.


58
00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:44.120
Okay. Be right there.

59
00:03:55.048 --> 00:03:58.176
Oh, my God,
I got so wasted last night.


60
00:03:58.885 --> 00:04:00.220
So, wait, what happened?

61
00:04:00.386 --> 00:04:03.097
The bouncer wouldn't let you in
with your In-N-Out.


62
00:04:03.473 --> 00:04:05.153
Which was obviously unacceptable.

63
00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:08.436
Right. So, that's when we hoisted
you over the wall of the patio.


64
00:04:08.686 --> 00:04:10.446
And then,
you fall into the cactus.


65
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.100
Oh, dude. They're everywhere.

66
00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:16.444
It's like I was giving blowies
in the desert all night.


67
00:04:17.737 --> 00:04:19.697
Oh, fuck. I have work tomorrow.

68
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:21.866
Yeah, I have a practice exam
in the morning.


69
00:04:22.325 --> 00:04:23.325
All right.

70
00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:25.787
- Bye, ladies.
- Bye.


71
00:04:26.162 --> 00:04:27.705
- I love you.
- Bye.


72
00:04:29.207 --> 00:04:30.207
Bye.

73
00:04:31.584 --> 00:04:33.184
Okay. To the homestead?

74
00:04:35.713 --> 00:04:37.433
Thomas wants us to come
to Top of the World.


75
00:04:38.383 --> 00:04:40.426
- Cool.
- Okay, okay, okay.


76
00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.679
Would you rather
lose all the hair on your body


77
00:04:42.929 --> 00:04:44.472
or be a prostitute for a week?

78
00:04:45.682 --> 00:04:47.141
- Prostitute for a week.
- Easily.


79
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.143
You didn't even hear the parameters.

80
00:04:49.644 --> 00:04:52.063
No hair whatsoever,
no eyebrows, no lashes.


81
00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:54.482
Oh, please. Come on.
I pay good money to have hot wax


82
00:04:54.565 --> 00:04:55.918
rip most of that shit
out of my body anyway.


83
00:04:55.942 --> 00:04:59.279
Yeah, for real.
But seriously, feel how smooth.


84
00:05:00.154 --> 00:05:01.239
Is it good?

85
00:05:01.322 --> 00:05:03.658
It might be cool
to be all slithery like a dolphin.


86
00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:09.455
I don't think I'd do well as a prostitute.
I'd definitely end up a truck-stop boy.


87
00:05:09.622 --> 00:05:12.208
I'd be an escort, but I'd only take jobs
from Johns who, like,


88
00:05:12.292 --> 00:05:14.002
- wanted to be dominated and stuff.
- Yeah.


89
00:05:15.003 --> 00:05:17.005
You guys have always sucked at this.

90
00:05:17.088 --> 00:05:20.300
Whatever. Your go-to used to be
fart out of your mouth or sweat piss?


91
00:05:20.383 --> 00:05:23.177
Still a valid question.
You lack imagination.


92
00:05:24.762 --> 00:05:28.349
Can't believe school's in your hands now.
It's all downhill.


93
00:05:28.725 --> 00:05:29.885
Every year says that.

94
00:05:30.018 --> 00:05:33.187
And this bitch will be president
and these things will be extra special.


95
00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:38.839
All right. Come on.
I'm tired as balls. Let's get out of here.


96
00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:41.612
Thomas, I told mom
we'd be home soon.


97
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:43.740
Xi'an dinner tomorrow night?

98
00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:46.200
- Oh, definitely.
- Okay.


99
00:05:46.617 --> 00:05:48.619
We got to hit all the usual spots
before you go.


100
00:05:51.164 --> 00:05:53.791
Okay. Bye, Thomas.
See you at home.


101
00:05:53.875 --> 00:05:56.169
Don't be too long. 
Mom's gonna be pissed.

102
00:06:00.048 --> 00:06:01.048
Love you.

103
00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:03.801
Love you, girls.

104
00:06:25.156 --> 00:06:27.533
<i>Today we mark a moment
we will never understand,</i>


105
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.411
<i>that life stops.</i>

106
00:06:31.662 --> 00:06:34.082
<i>A son, a brother,</i>

107
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:38.586
<i>a friend was taken from us.</i>

108
00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:41.523
<i>I've tried to take comfort in the fact</i>

109
00:06:41.547 --> 00:06:43.549
<i>that we are now
the stewards of his story...</i>


110
00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:46.094
<i>...of his joy,</i>

111
00:06:47.178 --> 00:06:48.262
<i>of his life.</i>

112
00:06:50.014 --> 00:06:52.350
<i>We must hold on to
that and to each other.</i>

113
00:07:03.778 --> 00:07:07.323
Oh, my God. Chloe,
we're so sorry. He meant so much to us.


114
00:07:07.615 --> 00:07:10.243
No. Not right now. No.

115
00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:24.257
<i>What other way is there to heal
the pain than to think of him and cry,</i>


116
00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:30.096
<i>and laugh, and be together?</i>

117
00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:52.159
Mint?

118
00:07:55.496 --> 00:07:56.747
I'm gonna chug it.

119
00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:02.753
Oh! My eyes.

120
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:08.092
Oh shit. You guys, we're late for yoga.

121
00:08:08.176 --> 00:08:09.844
Namast-gay.

122
00:08:10.344 --> 00:08:13.556
Oh. I got to meet with Student Council
Noah about prom.


123
00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:15.279
You, you have your college meeting, yeah?

124
00:08:15.433 --> 00:08:16.726
Oh, yeah. I should roll.

125
00:08:16.893 --> 00:08:18.728
- Love you.
- Love you, bye.


126
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:22.541
Okay. So it's all finished?

127
00:08:22.565 --> 00:08:23.941
- Pretty much.
- Okay. Great.


128
00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:27.236
Are you sure you want to shut down
a full road for a red carpet?


129
00:08:27.737 --> 00:08:31.824
Yes. Big gestures are very important.
Okay. So, what I'm thinking...


130
00:08:31.908 --> 00:08:33.034
Hey, Lil.

131
00:08:33.618 --> 00:08:35.328
Top of the afternoon, Guy.

132
00:08:36.412 --> 00:08:38.539
Aren't you supposed to be
in my class right now?


133
00:08:39.415 --> 00:08:41.375
Aren't you supposed to be
in your class right now?


134
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:45.129
- This never happened.
- What never happened?


135
00:08:47.006 --> 00:08:47.840
Here you go.

136
00:08:47.924 --> 00:08:50.301
Okay. I'm super excited.
I'm gonna plaster these around.


137
00:08:50.384 --> 00:08:51.969
I'm thinking bathroom stalls.

138
00:08:52.053 --> 00:08:54.253
Because people taking shits
are a very captive audience.


139
00:08:54.472 --> 00:08:56.140
Ooh. Yeah. I like the way you move.

140
00:08:56.224 --> 00:08:58.142
- Yeah. Bye.
- Bye.


141
00:09:05.983 --> 00:09:07.151
- Hey.
- Hey.


142
00:09:07.235 --> 00:09:08.486
How'd it go?

143
00:09:08.903 --> 00:09:10.905
Uh, waitlist. Should find out this week.

144
00:09:10.988 --> 00:09:13.824
She just keeps telling me
to think positive thoughts.


145
00:09:14.825 --> 00:09:17.411
Sometimes I just wanna punch her
in her third eye.


146
00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:21.707
I guess if I don't get in,
Santa Barbara wouldn't be that bad.


147
00:09:22.416 --> 00:09:24.001
No. Hm-mmm.

148
00:09:24.252 --> 00:09:26.337
You're going to NYU
and I'm going to Columbia.


149
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.089
We're gonna be life partners forever.

150
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:31.467
God, imagine how many times
we've walked these halls and thought


151
00:09:31.884 --> 00:09:34.679
three months, two months, two weeks.

152
00:09:35.555 --> 00:09:37.223
How the fuck did we get here?

153
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.519
"Time has a terrible way of fleeting by."

154
00:09:42.395 --> 00:09:44.564
My mom wrote that to me
in a letter when I was eight.


155
00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:46.440
Okay. I got to dump out.

156
00:09:51.445 --> 00:09:53.382
I can't believe
you like shitting at school.


157
00:09:53.406 --> 00:09:54.699
I'm very comfortable here.

158
00:09:55.783 --> 00:09:56.784
So...

159
00:09:57.076 --> 00:09:58.369
- Yo! What's up?
- Hey.


160
00:09:58.452 --> 00:09:59.888
Just the girl I was looking for.

161
00:09:59.912 --> 00:10:01.455
- Oh, Sam.
- Jared.


162
00:10:01.539 --> 00:10:03.249
Jared. Hey guys, what's up?

163
00:10:03.583 --> 00:10:08.129
So, we got a create-a-party tomorrow
at Carrie's and I need to spread the word.


164
00:10:10.006 --> 00:10:11.340
- Hold on.
- Uh-oh.


165
00:10:11.757 --> 00:10:13.134
I know what this is.

166
00:10:13.884 --> 00:10:14.884
Hi, guys.

167
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:20.558
Hi. So, it was a really good day
at Path Less Taken, wasn't it?


168
00:10:20.641 --> 00:10:22.601
Yeah, this guy knows
what I'm talking about. Cool.


169
00:10:22.727 --> 00:10:24.937
Okay. So we only have
two weeks left, right?


170
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:27.901
- We need to cherish...
- And so, at prom, you two going together?


171
00:10:28.065 --> 00:10:31.027
Well, yeah. <i>Mein Fuhrer</i> 's orders.

172
00:10:31.986 --> 00:10:34.238
Yeah, she used to pencil in our playdates.

173
00:10:34.322 --> 00:10:37.617
Prom, May 18th, it's gonna be
the best night of your life.


174
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.511
- But it's a shame though.
- I promise you.


175
00:10:39.535 --> 00:10:41.615
- Buy tickets, please.
- I look fine in a tux.


176
00:10:41.662 --> 00:10:45.124
Please, please.
Also, party at Carrie's tomorrow night.


177
00:10:45.458 --> 00:10:46.876
Yes, thank you.

178
00:10:48.377 --> 00:10:49.754
- Bye.
- Here you go.


179
00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:53.299
Hey.

180
00:10:53.382 --> 00:10:54.800
- Yo.
- Yo.


181
00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:57.845
- Pretty good, huh?
- Mmm, that was nice.


182
00:10:57.928 --> 00:11:00.097
- Bemis alarm. 3:00.
- Oh. Ooh,


183
00:11:01.223 --> 00:11:02.224
Bemis.

184
00:11:02.475 --> 00:11:04.352
Bite my penis.

185
00:11:06.937 --> 00:11:09.097
- Bemis is really hot.
- I know, right?


186
00:11:09.148 --> 00:11:10.483
I like his wizard glasses.

187
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:13.069
Yeah, I'd let him Harry Potter this.

188
00:11:20.076 --> 00:11:21.494
You should hide Donkey Bong better.

189
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:25.331
Come on. We need him around.
His last days of high school, too.


190
00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:27.684
So we'll pick up tree
then meet at my house, yeah?


191
00:11:27.708 --> 00:11:28.751
- For sure.
- Okay. Bye.


192
00:11:33.172 --> 00:11:34.172
Becks.

193
00:11:34.673 --> 00:11:35.673
Beck.

194
00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:38.177
Rebecca, come on.

195
00:11:39.804 --> 00:11:40.804
Becks.

00:11:58.948 --> 00:12:00.991
Hello? Yeah, father.

205
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.786
Divorce meeting tomorrow, remember?

206
00:12:05.204 --> 00:12:06.831
Why don't you call her?

207
00:12:07.415 --> 00:12:08.415
Bye.

208
00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:10.118
Are you f...

209
00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:11.544
Hey, don't text and drive.

210
00:12:13.254 --> 00:12:16.507
From Dad, "Your mother is a bitch."

211
00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:18.926
Is everything okay?

212
00:12:20.594 --> 00:12:24.890
Do you ever feel like your parents only
see you as an extension of their own ego


213
00:12:24.974 --> 00:12:27.810
and have no regard
for your personal happiness


214
00:12:27.893 --> 00:12:29.270
as an autonomous human being?

215
00:12:29.812 --> 00:12:32.707
Yes. And they just don't know how to
support you in the ways that you need,


216
00:12:32.731 --> 00:12:35.151
and that makes you feel alienated,
and then you feel guilty


217
00:12:35.234 --> 00:12:36.753
for feeling alienated,
and then you resent them


218
00:12:36.777 --> 00:12:38.880
for making you feel guilty
for feeling alienated, but the truth is


219
00:12:38.904 --> 00:12:41.657
they just don't have the capacity
to understand or care?


220
00:12:42.366 --> 00:12:44.285
Yeah. Hold on.

221
00:12:44.785 --> 00:12:46.787
What were you and Bemis talking about?

222
00:12:46.912 --> 00:12:51.625
Ugh. So, I gave a great presentation
on Kant today,


223
00:12:51.917 --> 00:12:55.463
and then found this in my locker.

224
00:12:56.547 --> 00:13:00.759
"I KANT stand this KUNT."
That's actually pretty clever.


225
00:13:01.343 --> 00:13:03.637
Well, fuck you, because Bemis

226
00:13:04.013 --> 00:13:07.433
said that my unpacking
of the third formulation was enlightened.


227
00:13:07.683 --> 00:13:11.645
Mmm. Are you sure he wasn't talking
about the unpacking of his cock?


228
00:13:12.271 --> 00:13:13.731
That... Ten and two.

229
00:13:13.856 --> 00:13:15.649
Jesus.

230
00:13:15.816 --> 00:13:18.861
Who goes there? What up?

231
00:13:18.944 --> 00:13:20.946
- What up?
- Okay, okay. I knew it was you.


232
00:13:21.447 --> 00:13:23.991
Thank you for putting up
my draconian security protocol.


233
00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:26.307
How y'all doing? Have a seat.

234
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.288
Uh, I laid out
a little sample sale here.


235
00:13:29.371 --> 00:13:33.125
We got Pluto OG,
aka Neil deGrasse Tyson.


236
00:13:33.667 --> 00:13:37.129
Next up we got one I call Kramer,
because it like pops in.


237
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:39.990
You know I'm saying?
And then we got Strawberry Cough


238
00:13:40.257 --> 00:13:42.857
and Barack O'bubba Kush,
because I know you're political and shit.


239
00:13:43.177 --> 00:13:44.595
- Ha!
- Get some Cough.


240
00:13:46.138 --> 00:13:47.498
That was your bro's favorite, too.

241
00:13:50.643 --> 00:13:52.728
Highs and lows?

242
00:13:53.729 --> 00:13:56.398
I'll go first. Highs,

243
00:13:56.899 --> 00:14:00.486
prom-planning, duh. 
Uhm, and lows,

244
00:14:01.195 --> 00:14:04.907
hmm, only having two weeks left
of high school with you guys.


245
00:14:05.157 --> 00:14:06.951
That was so sad, it sucks.

246
00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:09.346
Becks' eye-fucked Bemis
for, like, 30 full seconds.


247
00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:13.832
Oh, yeah, I did, because Amelia,
in yoga, was pose banging Aaron Jakes'


248
00:14:13.916 --> 00:14:14.959
like cat and cow.

249
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:17.962
How about this? You like that one?
You like this one?


250
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.339
How's my pussy looking downward dog?

251
00:14:20.548 --> 00:14:22.268
Oh, look at that.
What's that one?


252
00:14:22.383 --> 00:14:24.260
How's that back arch
for my vagina?


253
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.554
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Aaron Jakes,

254
00:14:26.637 --> 00:14:29.515
the, the sophomore
who wears that puka shell necklace?


255
00:14:29.598 --> 00:14:31.892
- Have his balls even dropped yet?
- Yes.


256
00:14:32.726 --> 00:14:33.853
Into your mouth?

257
00:14:34.603 --> 00:14:36.605
A couple times. 
He could be fun for prom.

258
00:14:39.441 --> 00:14:42.027
Have you guys given thought
to going to prom together?


259
00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.154
Just girls?

260
00:14:44.572 --> 00:14:47.032
Oh, I want a real prom date,
like with a penis.


261
00:14:47.116 --> 00:14:50.494
I know. There will be plenty of guys
to satisfy us at After Prom.


262
00:14:50.786 --> 00:14:52.204
Okay. Sorry, Slutty B. Anthony.

263
00:14:52.288 --> 00:14:54.957
But this is about more than just
girl power and getting laid.


264
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.376
Ugh, fine, you guys are such girls.

265
00:14:57.751 --> 00:14:59.351
You should invite Bemis to prom.

266
00:14:59.461 --> 00:15:01.714
I might invite him
to the graduation party.


267
00:15:02.089 --> 00:15:03.382
- Ooh.
- Hi, guys.


268
00:15:03.465 --> 00:15:05.092
- Hi, Jill.
- Hi.


269
00:15:05.175 --> 00:15:06.927
Jill, who did you take to prom?

270
00:15:07.595 --> 00:15:11.015
Uhm, I went with, uh, Lily's dad.

271
00:15:11.682 --> 00:15:16.145
So, look how well that turned out.
Just kidding.


272
00:15:16.979 --> 00:15:18.522
- Little girls.
- Love you.


273
00:15:19.023 --> 00:15:20.608
Not so little anymore.

274
00:15:21.567 --> 00:15:23.647
Now they're just a bunch
of washed-up skanks.


275
00:15:23.694 --> 00:15:25.112
- What the fuck? Shut up.
- Whoa.


276
00:15:25.195 --> 00:15:26.756
- Excuse me.
- They washed-up, they swag.


277
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.966
- They all washed-up.
- Fuck you.


278
00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.010
- It's over.
- Crap, I got to pick up your sister.


279
00:15:30.034 --> 00:15:31.354
I need some perfume. You got any?

280
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.704
Mom, she, she knows that you smoke.

281
00:15:33.913 --> 00:15:39.001
When you have kids,
you will know how important it is


282
00:15:39.335 --> 00:15:42.087
to keep up appearances for your children,

283
00:15:42.421 --> 00:15:46.175
and then slowly reveal all your flaws
when they're old enough to handle them.


284
00:15:46.508 --> 00:15:47.508
Okay, bye.

285
00:15:47.676 --> 00:15:49.487
- I love you girls so much.
- Love you.


286
00:15:49.511 --> 00:15:50.512
Love you.

287
00:15:52.556 --> 00:15:53.766
I can't wait to be a mother.

288
00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:57.561
- Go away. Get out of here.
- So weird. Go away.


289
00:15:59.313 --> 00:16:01.690
- How's everybody doing?
- Excited.


290
00:16:01.774 --> 00:16:03.651
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Uhm,


291
00:16:03.734 --> 00:16:06.487
Chloe hasn't heard from NYU yet,
so that's a bummer.


292
00:16:06.737 --> 00:16:09.448
Yeah, but I mean, wasn't she feeling
really good about UCSB?


293
00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:13.994
No. Us, going to school together,
near each other, that is part of the plan.


294
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.456
Okay, my little cruise director.

295
00:16:18.082 --> 00:16:19.208
- It is.
- Okay.


296
00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:22.670
- Sorry.
- Okay. Okay.


297
00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:26.840
- What's this? What are you writing?
- Oh. No, that's, uh...


298
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.009
it's for Clo.

299
00:16:29.969 --> 00:16:34.932
Tomorrow's Thomas' 19th birthday.
So, I just had some nice things planned.


300
00:16:37.768 --> 00:16:39.144
Do you wanna talk about it?

301
00:16:40.562 --> 00:16:41.563
I'm fine.

302
00:16:43.148 --> 00:16:46.068
It's gonna be a tough day, for everybody.

303
00:18:24.124 --> 00:18:26.794
You know,
he would have hated this shrine.


304
00:18:27.628 --> 00:18:33.092
"Don't be such a sad sack, mom. Turn it
into a pool room or a sex dungeon."


305
00:18:35.469 --> 00:18:36.470
Hmm.

306
00:18:37.805 --> 00:18:40.182
It's not
how it's supposed to be.


307
00:18:42.059 --> 00:18:43.185
I know.

308
00:18:44.228 --> 00:18:45.854
But it's how it is, mom.

309
00:18:54.071 --> 00:18:56.865
We, we could do something later, maybe.

310
00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:00.911
Yeah. Yeah.

311
00:19:13.298 --> 00:19:15.676
Top of the morning, Jerry.
You wanted to see me?


312
00:19:17.803 --> 00:19:19.304
So, how you doing?

313
00:19:20.389 --> 00:19:21.389
Great.

314
00:19:22.057 --> 00:19:23.225
A little wound-up lately?

315
00:19:24.393 --> 00:19:26.228
Uh, it's kind of my default.

316
00:19:27.104 --> 00:19:30.899
Okay. So, I wanted to talk to you about
some prom stuff before Student Council.


317
00:19:31.233 --> 00:19:33.527
I wanna talk to you about delegating.

318
00:19:34.153 --> 00:19:37.406
- You suck at it.
- Don't do this to me, Jerry. Don't do it.


319
00:19:37.489 --> 00:19:40.200
You know who...
- And just because it hasn't worked before,


320
00:19:41.034 --> 00:19:42.494
doesn't mean it never will.

321
00:19:43.495 --> 00:19:48.255
People can be there, if you let them. You have to share
this process, you have to share it with Student Council,


322
00:19:49.918 --> 00:19:52.478
especially with Noah, because
it looks like he's gonna be the one


323
00:19:52.504 --> 00:19:53.630
taking over next year.

324
00:19:54.131 --> 00:19:58.510
Okay. A wise man once told me, "The world
begins when I'm born and ends when I die."


325
00:19:59.011 --> 00:20:02.055
And I really feel that that applies
to my tenure here. So, let's just,


326
00:20:02.139 --> 00:20:04.558
you know, let that one marinate
and then we can circle back.


327
00:20:06.768 --> 00:20:08.270
That doesn't make any sense.

328
00:20:09.104 --> 00:20:14.784
My buddy was in jail at San Quentin. He was jonesing for some blow.
Uh, those days I had a pretty good arm. So, I loaded up a tennis ball


329
00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:25.204
with some grade A quality snow,
hurled it over the wall.


330
00:20:25.829 --> 00:20:26.955
It worked out great.

331
00:20:27.623 --> 00:20:31.335
Okay. Let's get started
with those drug presentations.


332
00:20:31.418 --> 00:20:34.296
- PCP?
- I have to go to the bathroom.


333
00:20:34.796 --> 00:20:38.467
- Uhm, can it wait?
- If you want a bloody beanbag.


334
00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.308
Menstruation is a miracle. I'm jealous
that I can't experience it myself.


335
00:20:48.352 --> 00:20:49.394
Take your time.

336
00:20:52.773 --> 00:20:55.317
All right. Who's ready? Angel dust?

337
00:21:26.932 --> 00:21:29.309
<i>Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?</i>

338
00:21:29.768 --> 00:21:32.771
<i>I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by
and get you girls in 30.</i>


339
00:21:32.896 --> 00:21:35.107
<i>I love you.
I'll call you when I'm outside.</i>


340
00:21:42.447 --> 00:21:44.700
<i>Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?</i>

341
00:21:45.284 --> 00:21:48.203
<i>I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by
and get you girls in 30.</i>


342
00:21:48.328 --> 00:21:50.622
<i>I love you.
I'll call you when I'm outside.</i>


343
00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:54.876
<i>Hey, Clo, you still at Lil's?</i>

344
00:21:55.877 --> 00:21:58.588
<i>I'm, uh, I'm gonna swing by
and get you girls in 30.</i>


345
00:21:59.256 --> 00:22:01.216
<i>I love you.
I'll call you when I'm outside.</i>


346
00:22:14.646 --> 00:22:16.523
Clo. Clo.

347
00:22:17.316 --> 00:22:19.901
- Hey.
- Hey. I took the liberty.


348
00:22:20.986 --> 00:22:23.196
- Is class over?
- Yeah.


349
00:22:25.574 --> 00:22:27.284
- Thank you.
- No problem.


350
00:22:36.334 --> 00:22:37.334
It was a hard day.

351
00:22:40.672 --> 00:22:41.672
Here.

352
00:22:45.302 --> 00:22:46.303
To Thomas,

353
00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:50.724
who showed us that

354
00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.770
you can be smart,

355
00:22:56.146 --> 00:23:00.609
athletic, kind, and...

356
00:23:01.693 --> 00:23:04.196
fucking high all at the same time.

357
00:23:05.572 --> 00:23:06.865
- Cheers.
- Cheers.


358
00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:19.211
You want me to get Lil?

359
00:23:20.253 --> 00:23:24.466
No, it's okay. She's off saving the world,
one prom at a time.


360
00:23:26.343 --> 00:23:27.343
Yeah.

361
00:23:30.055 --> 00:23:33.058
Well, you know, uhm, speaking of prom...

362
00:23:34.267 --> 00:23:35.267
Uhm...

363
00:23:37.020 --> 00:23:40.148
I was a little worried that

364
00:23:40.649 --> 00:23:43.693
you might think I was just, like,
fucking around earlier.


365
00:23:45.195 --> 00:23:50.408
Definitely. I'd really like to go
with you, if you're into it?


366
00:23:50.784 --> 00:23:53.264
I don't know about your face.
I don't know if you would. But...


367
00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.830
No, I have this, uhm...

368
00:23:56.581 --> 00:23:59.918
I have this pre-frosh thing
at UCSB this weekend.


369
00:24:00.001 --> 00:24:01.086
-No. That's, that's chill.

370
00:24:01.169 --> 00:24:02.897
- I totally get that.
- No. No. No. No. I'm not saying that.


371
00:24:02.921 --> 00:24:07.050
I don't, I don't know
if I'm gonna go to that or not, uhm,


372
00:24:07.968 --> 00:24:10.262
but if I don't go,
I'd love to go to prom with you.


373
00:24:11.221 --> 00:24:12.848
Well you should then. Cool.

374
00:24:14.724 --> 00:24:16.685
<i>So Jerry will make</i>

375
00:24:16.768 --> 00:24:19.646
an announcement
and then it'll be girls' soccer,


376
00:24:19.729 --> 00:24:20.856
led by yours truly.

377
00:24:20.939 --> 00:24:25.193
Then it'll be boys' soccer,
though I really object to that order,


378
00:24:25.277 --> 00:24:27.904
but then we'll both celebrate
our crushing victories.


379
00:24:27.988 --> 00:24:29.739
Okay. Prom?

380
00:24:34.578 --> 00:24:38.999
I really need your guys' help on this.
So Noah...


381
00:24:39.249 --> 00:24:42.085
will you check the rates
at these catering companies?


382
00:24:42.627 --> 00:24:47.299
Uhm, try Alphonso at Café Food,
just let me know if you need any help.


383
00:24:47.382 --> 00:24:49.822
You know what, I can actually, I can...

384
00:24:52.095 --> 00:24:56.725
Noah, uh, are there some
agenda issues you'd like to address?


385
00:24:58.018 --> 00:25:01.730
So, there are many things
that are important for prom,


386
00:25:01.813 --> 00:25:05.859
but the most important thing,
is, uh, your date.


387
00:25:08.612 --> 00:25:10.822
Hmm. What's going on?

388
00:25:28.882 --> 00:25:32.761

397
00:26:11.841 --> 00:26:13.301
That was... doesn't that...

398
00:26:15.762 --> 00:26:18.202
Okay. Email tonight,
meeting adjourned, thank you guys.


399
00:26:19.641 --> 00:26:22.560
Look, I know I'm no Heath Ledger,
but I know you like big gestures so...


400
00:26:22.644 --> 00:26:25.772
Prom is my prom date
and it should be yours too.


401
00:26:29.901 --> 00:26:32.153
<i>I mean, dude, the ukulele...</i>

402
00:26:32.654 --> 00:26:35.031
Seriously? Have some self-respect.

403
00:26:35.532 --> 00:26:37.450
Yeah, but he planned
the whole thing though.


404
00:26:37.826 --> 00:26:38.826
Pretty fucking cute.

405
00:26:40.245 --> 00:26:41.496
- Hey.
- Hey.


406
00:26:41.621 --> 00:26:45.625
- Hey.
- Guys, I just had a serious CRAFT moment.


407
00:26:45.917 --> 00:26:48.688
What did you play, Light as a feather,
stiff as a board? I love that game.


408
00:26:48.712 --> 00:26:52.257
No. So I was sitting in the library,
and guess who walks in.


409
00:27:01.308 --> 00:27:05.020
- Hey. Rebecca.
- Hey. What's up?


410
00:27:05.437 --> 00:27:07.522
- A little light reading I see?
- Yeah.


411
00:27:07.605 --> 00:27:10.108
My parents never done one,
so I'm just trying to sort through


412
00:27:10.191 --> 00:27:12.610
and this one's my personal reading.

413
00:27:13.987 --> 00:27:15.739
Ah, well, uh,

414
00:27:16.781 --> 00:27:20.410
you know, sometimes
there's just no reason at all


415
00:27:21.703 --> 00:27:24.914
- and there's nothing pure about it.
- Yeah.


416
00:27:26.458 --> 00:27:27.459
Right.

417
00:27:29.586 --> 00:27:31.463
I'll just, uh, you know,

418
00:27:31.755 --> 00:27:33.475
- finish the shift.
- Yeah, nice seeing you.

00:28:53.878 --> 00:28:54.879
What's up?

429
00:29:03.304 --> 00:29:04.806
- Hey.
- Hey.


430
00:29:05.348 --> 00:29:06.641
The water hot enough for you?

431
00:29:09.227 --> 00:29:13.898
Have you ever masturbated to completion
next to a total stranger before?


432
00:29:15.859 --> 00:29:17.068
Bemis is hot.

433
00:29:19.028 --> 00:29:22.198
but in my fantasy,
it's Gore Vidal and Trent Reznor.


434
00:29:29.873 --> 00:29:31.166
Is that fucking crazy?

435
00:29:31.624 --> 00:29:33.334
Wait. So she knew you were masturbating?

436
00:29:33.418 --> 00:29:35.545
She knew who I was fantasizing about.

437
00:29:35.628 --> 00:29:38.107
I masturbate at school all the time,
it's a great burst of energy.


438
00:29:38.131 --> 00:29:40.216
It totally focuses and relaxes you.

439
00:29:40.842 --> 00:29:42.202
I'm never holding your hand again.

440
00:29:43.219 --> 00:29:47.599
Okay. So, if you send a sext
to somebody and they text you back,


441
00:29:47.682 --> 00:29:50.810
"O period K period", what do you reply?

442
00:29:51.644 --> 00:29:52.896
Aaron Jakes is a douche.

443
00:29:53.688 --> 00:29:55.048
Have you seen him again?

444
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:57.358
Just a few times,
late night at his house,


445
00:29:57.442 --> 00:29:59.861
younger boy throwdown,
they do what you say.


446
00:30:00.612 --> 00:30:02.280
Hm. Unless they turn you down.

447
00:30:03.907 --> 00:30:07.285
Anyway, indifference
is the greatest aphrodisiac.


448
00:30:07.452 --> 00:30:10.747
Yup, because Iceberg Slim said,
"You can't need the pussy."


449
00:30:11.498 --> 00:30:12.707
And who is Iceberg Slim?

450
00:30:12.791 --> 00:30:15.168
A great writer and renowned pimp.

451
00:30:15.627 --> 00:30:18.963
- How did the meeting go, Meils?
- Dude, divorce stuff sucks.


452
00:30:19.798 --> 00:30:24.385
My dad refuses to give Rosa benefits,
but then I see him and he gives me this.


453
00:30:24.803 --> 00:30:26.095
That's fucking suck.

454
00:30:27.222 --> 00:30:29.224
It's just such a fucking letdown,
you know.


455
00:30:31.434 --> 00:30:33.561
And this bracelet's
like really fucking tacky.


456
00:30:34.145 --> 00:30:37.232
- You should tell him it upsets you.
- No, you can't. He's a dick.


457
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:39.234
You might as well enjoy the perks.

458
00:30:40.151 --> 00:30:41.694
I fucked up my eyeliner.

459
00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:44.447
- This corner.
- Yeah.


460
00:30:44.781 --> 00:30:46.491
Okay. So...

461
00:30:47.116 --> 00:30:48.576
I have a little something.

462
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.498
It's Thomas' favorite.

463
00:31:03.383 --> 00:31:04.383
Oh.

464
00:31:10.181 --> 00:31:14.936
<i>♪ Happy birthday dear Thomas ♪</i>

465
00:31:16.229 --> 00:31:20.108
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

466
00:31:28.324 --> 00:31:30.326
Okay. To Thomas. All right.
Here we go, all right.


467
00:31:31.035 --> 00:31:32.555
That was the one, good cake.

468
00:31:33.913 --> 00:31:34.956
Very good cake.

469
00:31:35.373 --> 00:31:36.708
Taxi's here bellas.

470
00:31:37.292 --> 00:31:41.462
All right ladies, let's throw on
some slutty dresses and get fucked up.


471
00:31:42.338 --> 00:31:44.608
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Yeah, I'm over it.


472
00:31:44.632 --> 00:31:49.220
<i>♪ Give me my shot, give me my shot
Give me my shot, keep calm ♪</i>


473
00:31:49.304 --> 00:31:53.725
<i>♪ Give me my shot, give me my shot
Give me my shot, keep calm ♪</i>


474
00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:58.396
<i>♪ Give me my shot, give me my shot
Give me my shot, keep calm ♪</i>


475
00:31:59.314 --> 00:32:01.608
All right. Let's get schwatsy faced,

476
00:32:02.025 --> 00:32:04.903
zanzi-bars? Shrooms?
I don't care, whatever, I'll get weird.


477
00:32:05.445 --> 00:32:08.990
I'm gonna grab that blunt
from the Travises. Travis!


478
00:32:14.287 --> 00:32:15.287
Oh.

479
00:32:21.294 --> 00:32:23.421
Okay. I'm, I'll go to the bathroom.

480
00:32:29.093 --> 00:32:31.095
A lot of Wagner biographies.

481
00:32:33.264 --> 00:32:34.515
You go to Catcher High?

482
00:32:37.602 --> 00:32:38.602
That's a bummer.

483
00:32:38.811 --> 00:32:40.897
Uh-hmm. You a Path girl?

484
00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:41.980
Hmm.

485
00:32:45.443 --> 00:32:46.736
Enjoy yourself.

486
00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:48.529
Yeah, you too.

487
00:32:50.615 --> 00:32:52.158
Psst. Madame President?

488
00:32:53.368 --> 00:32:54.577
What the fuck?

489
00:33:00.667 --> 00:33:03.002
Were you waiting out here
for me with a joint?


490
00:33:03.378 --> 00:33:06.547
I was. Uh, it's an apology joint.

491
00:33:06.631 --> 00:33:11.719
No. I should apologize.

492
00:33:12.804 --> 00:33:14.806
You were really sweet. I was...

493
00:33:15.848 --> 00:33:17.517
I was a really big bitch, I'm sorry.

494
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.353
No. You weren't a bitch, you weren't.

495
00:33:20.436 --> 00:33:23.481
I, it's, most guys
look so cool to you

496
00:33:23.606 --> 00:33:28.444
and I thought that I would join the ranks
of those great uke players, but, uhm...


497
00:33:29.028 --> 00:33:31.406
I found out
that I'm not one of those guys,


498
00:33:32.281 --> 00:33:35.243
and I feel really bad
that I embarrassed you, I, I didn't...


499
00:33:37.245 --> 00:33:38.871
- I'm just not that kind of girl.
- Yeah.


500
00:33:38.955 --> 00:33:40.957
- Yeah. Uhm, and, and plus,
- Okay.


501
00:33:41.708 --> 00:33:43.251
I already have dates.

502
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:45.503
I thought prom was your date?

503
00:33:47.338 --> 00:33:50.758
Well, the girls and I
were probably gonna go together.


504
00:33:51.342 --> 00:33:54.846
Yeah, but, I mean, who are they
gonna dance with during slow songs?


505
00:33:55.805 --> 00:33:58.975
You'll be the one running shit,
they can't dance with you.


506
00:33:59.892 --> 00:34:03.855
Besides, I thought it might be nice
if you have someone to give you their coat


507
00:34:03.938 --> 00:34:04.938
if you get cold.

508
00:34:06.983 --> 00:34:08.783
Fuck. I'm a bitch.
That would be nice. You...


509
00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:17.785
You're so nice, you are. It's just,
I have a lot of things...


510
00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.003
I'm not that nice.

511
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:40.725
Okay. So, let's just hold our horses.

512
00:34:40.808 --> 00:34:42.244
- I'm here with my girls.
- Oh, no. No. No. Don't...


513
00:34:42.268 --> 00:34:45.271
Look, it's dark outside,
you're probably really drunk,


514
00:34:45.354 --> 00:34:47.207
I could be anyone to you.
So, if we're gonna do this,


515
00:34:47.231 --> 00:34:48.274
you need to come over

516
00:34:49.484 --> 00:34:51.569
in the afternoon,
it's much better lighting.


517
00:34:51.652 --> 00:34:52.652
Give me your phone.

518
00:34:58.868 --> 00:35:01.746
You are really fucking nice. Thank you.

519
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.580
- See you.
- Bye.


520
00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:05.958
Bye. Thank you.

521
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:10.797
Fuck yeah.

522
00:35:14.926 --> 00:35:16.761
Well, this is fucking cute.

523
00:35:17.136 --> 00:35:20.640
Meanwhile, my chocolate chunk prom date
is over there feeling on some


524
00:35:20.723 --> 00:35:22.475
just-started-birth-control-titties.

525
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:26.729
Fuck Aaron Jakes
and screw that tiny Tinkerbell cunt.


526
00:35:26.896 --> 00:35:28.856
I mean, what are we gonna do
about tree next year?


527
00:35:29.232 --> 00:35:31.352
That East Coast weed
is some schwag-ass shit.


528
00:35:31.818 --> 00:35:35.696
I feel like we're gonna be doing,
like, cool, like, brooding winter drugs,


529
00:35:35.988 --> 00:35:37.240
like, opium,

530
00:35:37.698 --> 00:35:38.698
you know?

531
00:35:39.283 --> 00:35:41.869
Chloe? Earth to Chloe.

532
00:35:42.286 --> 00:35:43.286
What's up?

533
00:35:45.081 --> 00:35:46.082
I, uhm,

534
00:35:48.626 --> 00:35:50.336
I got into NYU this morning.

535
00:35:51.379 --> 00:35:53.179
- You better fucking stop.
- Oh, my God.


536
00:35:53.214 --> 00:35:54.298
- Dude?
- Really?


537
00:35:54.924 --> 00:35:56.444
- Hm-mmm.
- What? What's wrong?


538
00:35:56.843 --> 00:35:57.885
You love Ol' West City.

539
00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:03.850
I think I wanna go to UCSB,
like, be close to my mom and stuff.


540
00:36:04.767 --> 00:36:06.185
Have you to talked to Lil?

541
00:36:06.811 --> 00:36:09.480
Oh, sorry, excuse me. Hey.

542
00:36:11.232 --> 00:36:15.319
Hey. They attached a trash bag
to a vaporizer, it's fucking dope, hit it.


543
00:36:19.115 --> 00:36:20.755
Wait, what happened to your lip?

544
00:36:22.785 --> 00:36:23.995
Younger boy throwdown?

545
00:36:24.537 --> 00:36:25.705
You fought a little boy?

546
00:36:26.372 --> 00:36:27.372
Mmm. Yeah.

547
00:36:28.332 --> 00:36:30.710
- What? Did I miss something?
- ...are star people.


548
00:36:33.462 --> 00:36:36.174
Oh, my God, something’s off
in PussTown USA. I'm so sorry.


549
00:36:36.674 --> 00:36:42.096
Uh, ah, Chloe, I know I said get weird
and do shrooms and shit,


550
00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:44.557
maybe, maybe you're getting
a little too weird?


551
00:36:44.974 --> 00:36:48.352
There's nothing weird about
just hanging with your prom date.


552
00:36:50.771 --> 00:36:53.232
But hold on,
what about those shrooms, though?


553
00:36:53.482 --> 00:36:55.693
It's disgusting,
there's splash everywhere.


554
00:36:57.945 --> 00:36:58.945
Damn it.

555
00:37:05.661 --> 00:37:07.455
Cops, cops with dogs.

556
00:37:07.538 --> 00:37:09.081
Shit. Go. Go.

557
00:37:09.415 --> 00:37:12.668
- Ah. Becks. Where's Becks? Where...
- Find her. Find her, meet me outside, go.


558
00:37:12.752 --> 00:37:15.588
Got a little roof on there. 
A little roof.

559
00:37:36.567 --> 00:37:38.152
Oh, what the...

560
00:37:39.237 --> 00:37:42.323
Ah! Ah! What the fuck! Really?

561
00:37:42.782 --> 00:37:44.218
- Becks.
- Becks? Becks.


562
00:37:44.242 --> 00:37:46.911
- No.
- Cops, cops, cops. Come on.


563
00:37:47.119 --> 00:37:49.121
Guys, I pulled out two tampons.

564
00:37:49.538 --> 00:37:51.249
- Dude, gross.
- I know.


565
00:37:51.374 --> 00:37:53.751
- How long were they in there?
- One was mummified.


566
00:37:53.834 --> 00:37:55.628
- So, they're like all...
- Yeah.


567
00:37:56.379 --> 00:37:57.630
- Like a loom.
- No.


568
00:37:57.713 --> 00:37:59.882
Like Penelope fighting off suitors.

569
00:38:01.884 --> 00:38:03.636
Okay. Come on, we
got to go. Come on.

570
00:38:07.348 --> 00:38:09.308
All right.
Party's over, let's go.


571
00:38:10.393 --> 00:38:12.113
Where are you ladies going?

572
00:38:13.521 --> 00:38:15.147
- Uhm...
- Yeah?


573
00:38:15.690 --> 00:38:19.277
Our friend Rebecca here
just had two tampons inside of her,


574
00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:21.195
and it was quite a struggle
to get them out.


575
00:38:23.155 --> 00:38:25.741
Maybe you, you have a, a daughter

576
00:38:25.825 --> 00:38:28.202
and you know how difficult tampons
can be sometimes.


577
00:38:29.578 --> 00:38:31.956
Yeah. She's got a point.
Nora just turned 13.


578
00:38:32.039 --> 00:38:34.142
I spent an hour outside the bathroom
yelling through the door,


579
00:38:34.166 --> 00:38:36.502
"Just shove it up there." Tampons.

580
00:38:37.378 --> 00:38:41.132
All right, ladies, that's it, come on,
party's over. Let's go. Be safe. Come on.


581
00:38:42.049 --> 00:38:44.635
Thank you, officers. Thank you.

582
00:38:45.261 --> 00:38:46.621
- Anyone else?
- Oh, oh, oh.


583
00:38:46.846 --> 00:38:49.181
There is this book,
it's called <i>It's Perfectly Normal,</i>


584
00:38:49.265 --> 00:38:52.143
it talks about everything
from discharge to tampons,


585
00:38:52.518 --> 00:38:54.478
you should really check it out.
Thank you so much.


586
00:38:56.314 --> 00:38:58.941
That's the most times
I’ve heard the word tampon ever.


587
00:38:59.525 --> 00:39:00.860
Did she just say discharge?

588
00:39:03.654 --> 00:39:07.283
Hey.
Croissants to soak up the poison


589
00:39:07.366 --> 00:39:09.035
that is rotting in your stomachs.

590
00:39:09.118 --> 00:39:11.370
Oh, Mr. Bemis loves croissants.

591
00:39:12.204 --> 00:39:15.541
I feel like your period
is punctuated by two huge dumps,


592
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:19.045
- one at the beginning and one at the end.
- Oh, we're synched. Mc-lin-tock.


593
00:39:20.296 --> 00:39:22.096
Yeah, I'm just happy,
I won’t have it at prom.


594
00:39:22.173 --> 00:39:24.800
Oh, yeah, which apparently
you are going to with Sam,


595
00:39:24.925 --> 00:39:29.096
- that's a subtle ditch, Judas.
- Oh, your face. I can’t. Too hung over.


596
00:39:29.388 --> 00:39:30.388
Where's the tree?

597
00:39:31.474 --> 00:39:33.476
I think we’re Treeless in Seattle.

598
00:39:34.101 --> 00:39:36.312
- Not even One Tree Hill?
- Nothing.


599
00:39:36.604 --> 00:39:39.732
All I’ve got are these weird
weed mint strips.


600
00:39:40.316 --> 00:39:41.108
Those even work?

601
00:39:41.192 --> 00:39:43.694
I don't know, we’ll see.
Either have really fresh breath


602
00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:46.071
or we'll be really high.

603
00:39:48.074 --> 00:39:49.074
Cheers.

604
00:39:49.325 --> 00:39:51.645
- Cheers bitches.
- Mazel tov.


605
00:39:53.913 --> 00:39:57.833
<i>I Am Legend</i> is how it will happen.
Someone will invent a cure for cancer


606
00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.419
and the vaccine will make everyone
a zombie brain-eater.


607
00:40:01.045 --> 00:40:02.671
<i>I Am Legend</i>?

608
00:40:03.631 --> 00:40:04.631
Okay...

609
00:40:05.174 --> 00:40:10.596
Would you rather have penises for fingers
or vaginas for ears?


610
00:40:10.679 --> 00:40:12.723
Hmm, do the penises get hard?

611
00:40:13.766 --> 00:40:14.850
Yes.

612
00:40:14.934 --> 00:40:17.103
Okay. But like can you control them
when they're hard?


613
00:40:17.186 --> 00:40:20.981
The thing with dick fingers,
is that you cannot wear rings,


614
00:40:21.399 --> 00:40:24.193
but if you have vaginal ears,
you can wear earrings.


615
00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.361
Like bling?

616
00:40:25.736 --> 00:40:27.321
- Like Vling.
- Vling.


617
00:40:29.198 --> 00:40:31.617
Wait, wait, wait, wait, girl,
listen, listen, listen.


618
00:40:31.909 --> 00:40:34.036
Yeah, what's up? Okay. What if

619
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.372
you have dick fingers and vagina ears?

620
00:40:36.914 --> 00:40:37.914
- Oh.
- Yeah.


621
00:40:39.125 --> 00:40:43.379
Like, oh,
like I've literally fucked my brains out.


622
00:40:43.671 --> 00:40:45.381
I've got brains coming out of my nose

623
00:40:45.881 --> 00:40:49.343
and jizz all over my head
and I haven't even made dinner yet.


624
00:40:49.802 --> 00:40:51.220
I'm making hamburger helpers.

625
00:40:51.303 --> 00:40:52.303
Eww.

626
00:40:52.888 --> 00:40:54.723
- Liv!
- Liv!


627
00:40:54.807 --> 00:40:57.119
- Oh yeah. Here's my baby sister!
- There she is.


628
00:40:57.143 --> 00:40:59.395
Wait, Liv, you’re in sixth grade?

629
00:40:59.687 --> 00:41:01.605
- Yeah?
- Dude,


630
00:41:01.689 --> 00:41:03.691
- my boobs were so big at sixth grade.
- That is...


631
00:41:03.774 --> 00:41:05.693
Yeah. That is the best fucking year,

632
00:41:05.776 --> 00:41:07.254
- it's gonna be the best year of your life.
- I hope not.


633
00:41:07.278 --> 00:41:08.422
- I promise.
- I hope you're the best.


634
00:41:08.446 --> 00:41:09.488
I promise.

635
00:41:09.989 --> 00:41:14.118
Oh no. Lil, I think Stella
ate your breath strips.


636
00:41:16.245 --> 00:41:18.080
Oh, Stella.

637
00:41:19.707 --> 00:41:21.208
You guys really like fresh breath.

638
00:41:22.209 --> 00:41:23.377
Stella.

639
00:41:24.837 --> 00:41:26.213
How are you feeling girl?

640
00:41:26.881 --> 00:41:28.382
Trippin' balls...

641
00:41:28.466 --> 00:41:30.676
Huge, sweaty balls...

642
00:41:31.469 --> 00:41:33.596
You're gonna get through this.

643
00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.056
I don't know man...

644
00:41:36.182 --> 00:41:39.768
Oh. Her breath smells like someone
hot boxed a toothpaste factory.


645
00:41:41.479 --> 00:41:44.482
Prom tickets, 15 dollars.

646
00:41:45.316 --> 00:41:47.067
Seriously guys, they're 15 bucks.

647
00:41:47.193 --> 00:41:49.028
Okay. After party tickets,

648
00:41:49.111 --> 00:41:51.780
Forty bucks apiece. Leggo.

649
00:41:52.781 --> 00:41:54.825
This is bullshit,
why do they want your tickets?


650
00:41:55.159 --> 00:41:58.454
Look, after Party is more important
than prom, all right?


651
00:41:58.537 --> 00:42:03.125
Prom is just an excuse for girls
to get fancy dresses and fake tans.


652
00:42:04.168 --> 00:42:07.963
And to make memories

653
00:42:08.047 --> 00:42:11.800
in a beautiful atmosphere,
all right, expertly created


654
00:42:11.884 --> 00:42:14.637
- by dedicated Student Council members.
- Hm-mmm.


655
00:42:15.429 --> 00:42:17.223
Look, you care too much. 
They smell it.

656
00:42:18.224 --> 00:42:21.077
Look, wanting people to be happy
and have a good time, that's a bad thing?


657
00:42:21.101 --> 00:42:24.271
No, it's just letting people
have a good time is better.


658
00:42:25.773 --> 00:42:26.773
Thank you.

659
00:42:28.025 --> 00:42:30.861
Look, you know, it’s fine
that you asked Chloe to prom,


660
00:42:30.945 --> 00:42:33.226
but you should've talked to me first.
What about bro code?


661
00:42:33.489 --> 00:42:34.966
I’m sorry. I didn’t want to upset you,

662
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:36.825
- okay?
- Whatever. It's cool.


663
00:42:37.493 --> 00:42:40.913
I mean, I guess if she's not gonna go
with me, you’re the next best thing.


664
00:42:41.372 --> 00:42:42.540
All right. We good?

665
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:43.624
Yeah, we're cool.

666
00:42:43.707 --> 00:42:45.334
- All right, thank you.
- All right.


667
00:42:47.294 --> 00:42:48.294
Oh, God.

668
00:42:48.337 --> 00:42:50.881
Meils. Meils, are you okay?

669
00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:54.468
I came here to give that
little piece of shit a piece of my mind.


670
00:42:54.552 --> 00:42:55.594
Piece of shit? Oh.

671
00:42:56.178 --> 00:42:58.973
Aaron Jakes. You know that little
taint-troll? Is he around here?


672
00:42:59.348 --> 00:43:02.226
All right, you know, you take that,
I'm gonna get this one home.


673
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:03.669
- Please do.
- All right. Let's go.


674
00:43:04.395 --> 00:43:06.105
Oh, shit, better grab Liv, come on.

675
00:43:08.524 --> 00:43:09.608
Aaron?

676
00:43:14.029 --> 00:43:15.030
I love him.

677
00:43:21.245 --> 00:43:22.245
Liv...

678
00:43:23.122 --> 00:43:24.206
what’s wrong?

679
00:43:26.125 --> 00:43:28.353
I got in trouble, because James
wrote something really gross


680
00:43:28.377 --> 00:43:29.753
in my paper on governments.

681
00:43:30.045 --> 00:43:30.879
- What?
- James,


682
00:43:30.963 --> 00:43:32.965
he must've gone
on the computer when it was up.


683
00:43:33.215 --> 00:43:34.215
What did it say?

684
00:43:35.217 --> 00:43:37.303
In the paragraph on oligarchies it said,

685
00:43:37.386 --> 00:43:40.097
"I like to sneak in
and watch my dad take showers."


686
00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:42.433
It’s not funny.

687
00:43:43.601 --> 00:43:45.769
He’s so mean, it really hurts me.

688
00:43:46.186 --> 00:43:49.940
Older brothers are gonna make fun of you.
All right? That's just what they do.


689
00:43:50.232 --> 00:43:53.110
James just sees you as a kid right now,
soon enough you'll be friends.


690
00:43:53.652 --> 00:43:54.570
But seriously, you have to admit.

691
00:43:54.653 --> 00:43:56.905
"I sneak in and watch my dad
take showers", that's funny.


692
00:43:58.073 --> 00:44:00.284
Wait, who told you guys about that?

693
00:44:01.577 --> 00:44:04.788
Okay. That only happened once, okay?

694
00:44:05.122 --> 00:44:07.958
And Liv, it was really scary.
Never do it, okay?


695
00:44:08.917 --> 00:44:10.919
It's like,
it's like an angry sea monster.


696
00:44:15.341 --> 00:44:17.426
Hey, look, look,
I'll talk to James, all right?


697
00:44:17.509 --> 00:44:19.303
- All right.
- Okay. Love you.


698
00:44:19.553 --> 00:44:21.305
- Love you. Bye.
- Bye.


699
00:44:22.848 --> 00:44:23.724
-Bye, Liv.

700
00:44:23.807 --> 00:44:24.975
- Bye.
- Jesus.


701
00:44:27.811 --> 00:44:30.981
Ugh, fuck. I want froyo.

702
00:44:32.941 --> 00:44:34.318
Hey, do you think we’re fucked up,

703
00:44:34.401 --> 00:44:36.481
because of our fucked up relationships
with our dads?


704
00:44:37.154 --> 00:44:39.073
Uh, you don’t have a relationship
with your dad.


705
00:44:40.032 --> 00:44:41.075
You know what I mean.

706
00:44:42.618 --> 00:44:45.829
Well, yeah, I mean,
everyone's dad fucks them up.


707
00:44:45.913 --> 00:44:50.209
Like, I see my dad and I'm like,
fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.


708
00:44:50.667 --> 00:44:56.215
But then, you know, I wanna see him
and I still want him to wanna see me.


709
00:44:56.298 --> 00:44:57.298
Yeah.

710
00:44:58.258 --> 00:45:00.386
I mean, I never
felt like I needed mine.

711
00:45:00.928 --> 00:45:02.638
I always have my mom, 
I have you guys.

712
00:45:02.805 --> 00:45:07.059
Mmm, but either your dad fucks you up,
because he's not there


713
00:45:07.142 --> 00:45:09.395
or your dad fucks you up,
because he's there


714
00:45:09.478 --> 00:45:11.980
and honestly
nobody can live up to that shit.


715
00:45:12.314 --> 00:45:13.314
Right.

716
00:45:14.733 --> 00:45:17.014
But I guess, until then,
he's still gonna get laid, right?


717
00:45:17.986 --> 00:45:19.029
Yeah.

718
00:45:20.155 --> 00:45:21.915
Hey, dickwad,
can I talk to you for a second?


719
00:45:24.618 --> 00:45:26.954
Your little essay addition,

720
00:45:28.247 --> 00:45:29.687
you have anything to say about that?

721
00:45:33.627 --> 00:45:38.632
Oh! You're repulsive.
That is disgusting. God, dear God.


722
00:45:42.386 --> 00:45:43.386
Okay.

723
00:45:44.263 --> 00:45:46.741
You know how many peoples' games you just
ruined? Abdul’s gonna be pissed at me.


724
00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:48.767
Oh, cry me a river, 
Leroy Jenkins.

725
00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.602
Dude, this is serious.

726
00:45:50.936 --> 00:45:52.656
It's a joke.
She's not gonna get in trouble.


727
00:45:52.729 --> 00:45:54.648
No, it’s not about school, it’s about her.

728
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:57.630
Poor thing, she thinks that you hate her.
She needs you. Look,


729
00:45:58.485 --> 00:46:01.605
we’re the only other people who know
what we’ve been through, all right? And...


730
00:46:02.865 --> 00:46:04.366
you know, pretty soon, your friends,

731
00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:05.802
they're gonna wanna bang her
and if you're not nicer,


732
00:46:05.826 --> 00:46:08.346
- she, she's probably gonna do it.
- Dude, don’t talk about my friends


733
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:12.207
- fucking my baby sister.
- Look, you talked about her peep-holeing


734
00:46:12.291 --> 00:46:14.751
her own dad in writing,
in writing to her teacher.


735
00:46:15.085 --> 00:46:17.171
Uh, yeah, but that's funny,

736
00:46:17.254 --> 00:46:19.054
because we don't have a dad.

737
00:46:19.756 --> 00:46:20.799
Seriously?

738
00:46:21.717 --> 00:46:23.510
Noah
Hang? I'm nearby.


739
00:46:25.554 --> 00:46:27.806
- Where are you going?
- Read a book.


740
00:46:32.561 --> 00:46:34.354
And this is
where the magic happens.


741
00:46:34.813 --> 00:46:36.398
This is awesome.

742
00:46:36.482 --> 00:46:38.066
Thanks. How was your day?

743
00:46:38.734 --> 00:46:44.448
Uh, It was, it was good. Uhm, that guy Ken
was a dick in Academic Journal.


744
00:46:44.573 --> 00:46:47.159
There’s this like, this freshman girl...

745
00:46:48.327 --> 00:46:51.747
Oh, my God. This is really out of tune.
It's horrible.


746
00:46:52.372 --> 00:46:55.667
So there's this freshman girl who wears
those kind of like <i>risqué</i> stuff


747
00:46:55.751 --> 00:46:59.880
and he makes these gross comments about it
and she's so fucking schevvy like...


748
00:46:59.963 --> 00:47:04.635
Young male teachers have a hard time
handling a burgeoning young woman, so...


749
00:47:09.056 --> 00:47:12.476
Yes, well, you are very burgeoning.

750
00:47:12.851 --> 00:47:14.871
Look, I'll talk to him,
if he's got a problem with her,


751
00:47:14.895 --> 00:47:17.147
he should really
have a female counselor speak to her.


752
00:47:17.481 --> 00:47:20.442
I, uhm, I wasn't listening
to anything you just said.


753
00:47:20.901 --> 00:47:24.446
See, you would've missed all this
in the dark, drunken stupor of the party.


754
00:47:45.801 --> 00:47:47.844
- Hey, that just tickles.
- Yeah.


755
00:47:49.179 --> 00:47:50.179
I got it.

756
00:47:52.474 --> 00:47:53.475
Wow.

757
00:47:58.522 --> 00:47:59.565
Can I take these off?

758
00:48:01.275 --> 00:48:03.860
That is so hot that you asked,
yes, please, take them off.


759
00:48:12.661 --> 00:48:13.829
Okay. So, uhm...

760
00:48:14.413 --> 00:48:17.183
I'm gonna get really quiet, but it,
it's not that it doesn't feel good.


761
00:48:17.207 --> 00:48:18.792
It's, it's because that it does

762
00:48:18.875 --> 00:48:22.504
and I just wanna focus on that moaning.
It's too distracting.


763
00:48:28.677 --> 00:48:31.430
11 minutes later...

764
00:48:31.513 --> 00:48:33.557
Keep going. Right there, 
I'm gonna cum.

765
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:36.809
Okay, wait.

766
00:48:41.857 --> 00:48:43.066
Are you fucking kidding me?

767
00:48:44.901 --> 00:48:45.901
Fuck me.

768
00:48:46.111 --> 00:48:47.111
Okay.

769
00:48:52.242 --> 00:48:53.327
You're fucking beautiful.

770
00:48:56.038 --> 00:48:58.248
Okay. Reciprocity.

771
00:48:59.541 --> 00:49:01.043
- What?
- Take these off.


772
00:49:09.718 --> 00:49:10.969
Oh, fuck.

773
00:49:13.013 --> 00:49:14.640
Look <i>moi</i>. No hands.

774
00:49:15.223 --> 00:49:16.224
That's awesome.

775
00:49:17.059 --> 00:49:18.059
Oh, fuck.

776
00:49:18.935 --> 00:49:20.896
Afternoon Delight is the best.

777
00:49:21.688 --> 00:49:22.898
- Hey.
- You're amazing.


778
00:49:23.148 --> 00:49:25.317
Yeah. Yeah, that was, that was awesome.

779
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.195
I'm gonna... a lot of energy
for the game now. Thanks.


780
00:49:29.071 --> 00:49:32.115
Hey, so, uhm, listen. Would you ever
wanna come over to my house


781
00:49:32.616 --> 00:49:36.536
and, like, have dinner with my parents
and just, like, hang out with my family?


782
00:49:38.121 --> 00:49:44.753
Uhm, yeah, I, I would love to come over
and meet your parents as a mentor,


783
00:49:45.879 --> 00:49:50.467
guidance figure in your life. But, uhm,
I mean, they'll really like me


784
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:55.430
and you'll like that and that's, that's,
that's just bad news for everyone, so...


785
00:49:55.806 --> 00:49:57.933
Well, well, I mean, 
I already like you.

786
00:49:58.725 --> 00:50:01.204
Like, I'm not trying to date you.
I, I know that you have to leave soon


787
00:50:01.228 --> 00:50:04.106
and my crazy ex would kill me if...

788
00:50:04.189 --> 00:50:05.208
What, the one from Catcher?

789
00:50:05.232 --> 00:50:06.912
Yeah. Yeah.
They're gonna play her tonight.


790
00:50:07.275 --> 00:50:10.129
You got to watch out. She got wind
of this and she's, she's really pissed.


791
00:50:10.153 --> 00:50:12.906
All right, ladies,
we want a good, clean game.


792
00:50:13.281 --> 00:50:14.950
Tough with these messy skanks.

793
00:50:15.659 --> 00:50:16.659
- Excuse me?
- Call it.


794
00:50:17.077 --> 00:50:18.745
- Heads.
- You would.


795
00:50:18.912 --> 00:50:21.206
- What does that even mean?
- Heads it is.


796
00:50:35.429 --> 00:50:36.888
Run that shit.

797
00:50:38.515 --> 00:50:39.933
Independent women.

798
00:50:40.851 --> 00:50:43.895
- You know, he was at my place last night.
- Well, that's cool. I'm a sharer.


799
00:50:44.104 --> 00:50:45.772
Stay away from him, cock goblin.

800
00:50:49.609 --> 00:50:50.609
Oh.

801
00:50:50.819 --> 00:50:51.820
Boo!

802
00:50:53.238 --> 00:50:55.407
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
- What the fuck?


803
00:50:55.824 --> 00:50:58.034
Ref, your voicemail box is full,
you missed the ball.


804
00:51:08.044 --> 00:51:12.132
No one's gonna go for that...

805
00:51:14.509 --> 00:51:15.552
Done, bitch.

806
00:51:16.678 --> 00:51:19.306
Keanu Reeves's mother
is actually Asian.


807
00:51:19.389 --> 00:51:21.558
So, that's why <i>The Matrix</i> is pretty
cool.


808
00:51:21.641 --> 00:51:25.228
Because, uh, some say it's based on
Baudrillard's <i>Simulacra and Simulation,</i>


809
00:51:25.312 --> 00:51:27.898
but he refuted the comparison.
It's not even a thing.


810
00:51:29.399 --> 00:51:31.777
I can't believe
what a raging bitch Noah's ex is.


811
00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.403
Guys like crazy girls.

812
00:51:33.987 --> 00:51:36.031
Yeah, I'm not getting involved
with that shit.


813
00:51:36.114 --> 00:51:39.910
I am not playing <i>The Boy is Mine</i>
my last week of senior year.


814
00:51:40.118 --> 00:51:41.995
Yo. You two right here?

815
00:51:42.662 --> 00:51:44.862
You two were too fucking amazing tonight.
You know that?


816
00:51:46.833 --> 00:51:48.627
Yeah. You know that moment
when you just know


817
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:50.271
you're not gonna be
a professional athlete?


818
00:51:50.295 --> 00:51:52.297
- Hm-mmm.
- I kind of have one tonight.


819
00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:56.384
Mmm, well, that moment that you had,
comes a little later for black folk.


820
00:51:56.468 --> 00:51:58.595
Yes, but I get you though. I do.

821
00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.973
So, uhm, celebratory roll

822
00:52:02.265 --> 00:52:03.683
- for your victory, though?
- Ooh.


823
00:52:03.809 --> 00:52:06.061
- Where did you get this?
- You don't need to know.


824
00:52:06.812 --> 00:52:09.147
Okay, guys, seriously,
just, like, drink lots of water.


825
00:52:09.439 --> 00:52:12.168
- Stay hydrated, please.
- Let's see you on the other side.


826
00:52:12.192 --> 00:52:14.027
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

pre-frosh thing at UCSB this weekend.

849

- Hold on, I'm gonna come. I'm gonna come.
- Mike. Get off. Get off.


903
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:06.588
Can I have my underwear, please?

904
00:59:09.734 --> 00:59:11.986
- No.
- You look really bad, Lil.


905
00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:16.407
Have you seen Chloe
or Amelia or Becks anywhere?


906
00:59:16.491 --> 00:59:19.202
I'm pretty sure they all left.
I saw them walking outside.


907
00:59:19.869 --> 00:59:22.205
- They left?
- Yeah. Sorry.


908
01:00:01.327 --> 01:00:03.687
I'm headed to Moreno Street.

909
01:00:23.182 --> 01:00:25.935
Oh! My face hurts.

910
01:00:28.396 --> 01:00:29.564
Morning sluts.

911
01:00:30.189 --> 01:00:32.650
Hey, are you okay?

912
01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:37.864
Oh, sorry about the leaving confusion.

913
01:00:37.989 --> 01:00:41.149
We couldn't find you for hours and then
Alicia the Cunt said you'd already left.


914
01:00:42.118 --> 01:00:43.286
Yeah, what the fuck happened?

915
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:46.550
We couldn't find you. Your phone was off.
We were in the tree house.


916
01:00:46.706 --> 01:00:47.786
Yeah, what happened to you?

917
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:51.990
Last night was really fucked up.

918
01:00:52.503 --> 01:00:56.341
- Yeah, we're pretty fucked up, right?
- No, you guys were fucked up to me.


919
01:00:58.551 --> 01:00:59.903
Guess you wanted
to get it in with Sam now,


920
01:00:59.927 --> 01:01:01.095
since you can't at prom, huh?

921
01:01:02.513 --> 01:01:05.099
- Why are you acting like this?
- I'm just trying to be honest.


922
01:01:06.434 --> 01:01:09.979
Chloe is not going to prom.
Chloe is going to orientation at UCSB.


923
01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.400
You guys knew?

924
01:01:17.236 --> 01:01:18.071
I had a feeling.

925
01:01:18.154 --> 01:01:22.283
I hadn't heard from NYU,
UCSB was sounding like the smart option,


926
01:01:22.575 --> 01:01:24.202
Lil. Maybe the thing that I wanna do.

927
01:01:24.619 --> 01:01:27.580
Oh, you hadn't heard?
And, and now you know, right?


928
01:01:30.917 --> 01:01:32.001
And you didn't tell me?

929
01:01:32.502 --> 01:01:34.837
I didn't wanna say anything
before prom and ruin anything.


930
01:01:34.921 --> 01:01:37.548
Ruin anything?
What about our fucking lives, Clo?


931
01:01:37.632 --> 01:01:40.385
- Calm down, Lily. This is good for us.
- Yeah. Yeah. This is great.


932
01:01:40.468 --> 01:01:43.262
Let's all just be alone,
that's a great way to go through life.


933
01:01:45.223 --> 01:01:47.225
You know what?
Last night was a little preview.


934
01:01:47.642 --> 01:01:49.122
You are fucked up and you're confused

935
01:01:49.602 --> 01:01:51.955
and you're feeling all sorts
of new emotions and then all of a sudden,


936
01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:54.219
you're in a dark room
with some sweaty guy on top of you,


937
01:01:54.273 --> 01:01:55.501
- but none of your friends will care,
- What?


938
01:01:55.525 --> 01:01:56.442
because none of your friends
are gonna be there


939
01:01:56.526 --> 01:01:58.379
and you're gonna be
absolutely fucking on your own.


940
01:01:58.403 --> 01:02:01.123
- What happened to you last night?
- What happened?


941
01:02:02.281 --> 01:02:04.742
Nothing. A guy was...

942
01:02:05.618 --> 01:02:08.162
was goal-oriented,
it was shitty. I'm fine,


943
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:10.415
but you guys ditched me
and that is not fine.


944
01:02:10.498 --> 01:02:12.898
Lily, you went off
with some dude and didn't tell us?


945
01:02:14.127 --> 01:02:16.063
- That's not our fault, Lil. We're...
- That's easy for you to say,


946
01:02:16.087 --> 01:02:17.231
you're turning your back on us.

947
01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:19.775
What are you, you think
you're gonna find some new best friends?


948
01:02:20.258 --> 01:02:22.218
What? I owe you,
so I can't make any new friends?


949
01:02:26.556 --> 01:02:27.916
All, I'm just saying, like,

950
01:02:29.267 --> 01:02:31.686
how could you be friends
with someone who didn't know Thomas?


951
01:02:33.396 --> 01:02:35.022
Are you fucking serious?

952
01:02:36.023 --> 01:02:38.568
I can't be friends with anyone
who didn't know my dead brother?


953
01:02:40.194 --> 01:02:41.594
Jesus fucking Christ, Lily.

954
01:02:41.654 --> 01:02:44.198
He didn't die
so we could be best friends forever.


955
01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:46.677
We can still all be best friends.

956
01:02:46.701 --> 01:02:49.829
- Yeah.
- No. No, because she is fucking up


957
01:02:49.912 --> 01:02:51.372
the friend ecosystem.

958
01:02:52.123 --> 01:02:54.333
Like, I'm the glue here, but without Clo,

959
01:02:54.417 --> 01:02:57.003
your boy crazy ass
is gonna be with some dude.


960
01:02:57.086 --> 01:02:58.439
Your fuckin' head
is gonna be in the clouds.


961
01:02:58.463 --> 01:03:00.566
Yeah, my head's in the clouds,
because I’m, like, worrying about


962
01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:03.718
paying for loans and school and shit
that's never even entered your mind.


963
01:03:03.801 --> 01:03:07.764
Yeah, and I'm boy crazy?
Guys drive you fucking nuts, dude.


964
01:03:08.097 --> 01:03:12.977
Look, you don't deal. Your dad is gone.
The guy that you were in love with, died.


965
01:03:14.145 --> 01:03:16.898
- I'm sorry for the truth bomb.
- You know what?


966
01:03:17.565 --> 01:03:18.983
Lil, I'm just thinking about it.

967
01:03:19.901 --> 01:03:22.653
Every guy you've loved, has left.

968
01:03:22.862 --> 01:03:27.492
Okay, fuck! Fuck. I'm not trying
to psychoanalyze myself right now.


969
01:03:34.081 --> 01:03:35.792
- I'm outta here.
- This is your house.


970
01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:37.502
Yeah, make yourself at fucking home.

971
01:03:39.796 --> 01:03:42.965
This is an awkward moment,
but I feel like, uh, I have a coffee date,


972
01:03:43.382 --> 01:03:45.384
potential roommate situation.
Could you drive me?


973
01:03:45.468 --> 01:03:46.945
- I got you.
- Okay.


974
01:03:46.969 --> 01:03:49.597
Okay. She's gonna go. 
That was fucked up.

975
01:03:51.766 --> 01:03:52.766
Come on. Let's go.

976
01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:56.062
Hey. Lil.

977
01:04:00.483 --> 01:04:02.068
What the fuck is going on with you?

978
01:04:02.151 --> 01:04:04.231
I can't believe
you don't wanna go to school with me.


979
01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.989
and I seriously cannot believe
that you lied to me about it.


980
01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.284
This is fucking bullshit. You are
too smart to be acting this pathetic.


981
01:04:11.661 --> 01:04:13.013
You clearly don't understand at all

982
01:04:13.037 --> 01:04:15.474
- where I'm coming from.
- No, clearly you don't understand.


983
01:04:15.498 --> 01:04:20.878
All your cherishing every moment and prom
and your weird fucking memorials.


984
01:04:21.087 --> 01:04:23.774
Since Thomas died, you've gone
into overdrive. It's fucking oppressive.


985
01:04:23.798 --> 01:04:25.675
Yeah, this terrible thing happened

986
01:04:25.758 --> 01:04:28.278
and I'm just trying to get us through it.
I'm trying to make it better.


987
01:04:28.302 --> 01:04:30.388
Yeah, this terrible thing happened,

988
01:04:31.013 --> 01:04:34.392
but it doesn't mean everything else
has to be peachy fucking keen, Lily.


989
01:04:34.767 --> 01:04:36.477
Meils' parents still suck,

990
01:04:36.978 --> 01:04:39.397
Becks still has to worry about money,
your dad is still gone,


991
01:04:39.689 --> 01:04:42.942
I still have to deal with the gaping
fucking hole that's left in my family.


992
01:04:43.568 --> 01:04:47.071
- Life is hard and it keeps being hard.
- Clo, I know that.


993
01:04:49.115 --> 01:04:50.950
This has been really tough for me, too.

994
01:04:51.242 --> 01:04:53.369
- Oh, my God.
- And every time I try to talk to you


995
01:04:53.786 --> 01:04:55.556
- about it...
- Okay, but we are different, Lil.


996
01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.374
- Our shit is different.
- Yeah. I miss him, too.


997
01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:06.424
Okay. Well, you know what?
Sometimes you don't get to tell me that.


998
01:05:08.217 --> 01:05:10.011
You’re right, I, 
I'm not blood,

999
01:05:11.178 --> 01:05:12.889
but he was something else for me.

1000
01:05:14.140 --> 01:05:15.933
Dude, whatever you thought he was,

1001
01:05:16.642 --> 01:05:20.062
- he was actually my brother.
- Dude, I know.


1002
01:05:26.694 --> 01:05:29.155
And I, I, was, I was trying
to make this time special.


1003
01:05:29.238 --> 01:05:33.135
All right? I was trying to make our future special,
because, Clo, I don't know what I would do if I lost you.


1004
01:05:33.159 --> 01:05:35.119
Stop. Stop.

1005
01:05:36.913 --> 01:05:41.208
Oh, my God, I can't...
with this psycho girlfriend act.


1006
01:05:42.585 --> 01:05:44.128
This isn't you and I know it.

1007
01:05:53.429 --> 01:05:57.850
<i>♪ I'm okay alone ♪</i>

1008
01:05:59.852 --> 01:06:03.898
<i>♪ It makes my soul stir ♪</i>

1009
01:06:07.318 --> 01:06:11.697
<i>♪ Under microscopes ♪</i>

1010
01:06:13.115 --> 01:06:14.283
Oh. How adorable.

1011
01:06:15.242 --> 01:06:18.162
You know, college is gonna be
so great. We don't need any friends.


1012
01:06:18.371 --> 01:06:21.266
Yeah. We can totally reinvent ourselves
as sloppy skanks who don't need anyone


1013
01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:23.000
and gain 15 pounds.

1014
01:06:26.337 --> 01:06:27.922
God, shit buckets.

1015
01:06:30.633 --> 01:06:31.676
Fuck.

1016
01:06:41.143 --> 01:06:43.023
- Hello.
- What's going on back there?


1017
01:06:43.604 --> 01:06:45.606
- I'm sorry, I, I was...
- Texting?


1018
01:06:46.482 --> 01:06:47.984
- Thinking?
- Well...


1019
01:06:48.067 --> 01:06:50.045
you can't just stay still,
you have to keep moving.


1020
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:51.821
- I know.
- And other people have places


1021
01:06:51.904 --> 01:06:54.407
- to go, too, so you can't stop them.
- No, I, I know that.


1022
01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:58.244
There is a whole life happening
all around you and you can't control it


1023
01:06:58.369 --> 01:07:00.204
just by stopping whenever you please

1024
01:07:00.287 --> 01:07:02.265
and decide everybody else
just have to fall into place.


1025
01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:03.624
I get it, fuck!

1026
01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:08.254
Have you been smoking?

1027
01:07:09.422 --> 01:07:10.422
No.

1028
01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.466
Then what's that bong in the backseat?

1029
01:07:12.925 --> 01:07:17.925
Oh, that donk... That's funny. That's a, a sculpture that I, I
made in school. It is. I, we're, I, I'm Student Body President.


1030
01:07:22.268 --> 01:07:24.854
I'm a good kid. I am. I just,
I have a lot on my plate right now.


1031
01:07:24.937 --> 01:07:27.314
I'm so stressed out.
I, I, I'm graduating.


1032
01:07:27.398 --> 01:07:29.038
- Right now...
- Are you going to college?


1033
01:07:29.233 --> 01:07:30.526
Yeah, Columbia.

1034
01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:34.905
- It's a university.
- Oh, it is? It's not just a country?


1035
01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:37.300
Now, I wonder if the people at Columbia

1036
01:07:37.700 --> 01:07:40.536
would be excited to find out
that one of their future students


1037
01:07:40.703 --> 01:07:43.164
- was arrested for possession.
- What?


1038
01:07:43.873 --> 01:07:45.791
I don't know
what the fuck you're thinking


1039
01:07:45.875 --> 01:07:48.669
driving around with a bong
in the backseat of your car.


1040
01:07:48.753 --> 01:07:50.379
Who do you think you are, 
Willie Nelson?

1041
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:53.007
Now, even he got arrested.

1042
01:07:53.466 --> 01:07:54.550
You're arresting me?

1043
01:07:57.386 --> 01:08:00.723
All right. Look, I'm not,
I'm not gonna ruin your life forever.


1044
01:08:01.682 --> 01:08:03.267
Oh, thank God. Thank you.

1045
01:08:05.102 --> 01:08:07.271
But I am gonna fuck it up
for about a week.


1046
01:08:08.355 --> 01:08:11.192
God,
you could be in jail right now.


1047
01:08:11.734 --> 01:08:15.613
I can't believe
you would do something so stupid!


1048
01:08:15.696 --> 01:08:18.032
Mom, I'm a really safe driver.
I was just distracted.


1049
01:08:18.199 --> 01:08:19.199
Yeah, but...

1050
01:08:20.743 --> 01:08:21.743
Lil...

1051
01:08:24.038 --> 01:08:25.039
- Smash it.
- No.


1052
01:08:25.122 --> 01:08:26.457
- Yes.
- Mom.


1053
01:08:26.665 --> 01:08:27.875
This is Donkey Bong.

1054
01:08:28.292 --> 01:08:30.187
All right? He has been with us
through all of high school.


1055
01:08:30.211 --> 01:08:31.253
Thomas smoked out of this.

1056
01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:33.422
Smash it.

1057
01:08:33.672 --> 01:08:36.550
I wasn't even smoking. 
I was sad driving!

1058
01:08:36.759 --> 01:08:38.177
What's sad driving?

1059
01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:40.930
Rebecca was,
she was sitting with her new roommate.


1060
01:08:41.013 --> 01:08:43.724
Chloe's not going to NYU.
She fucking hates me


1061
01:08:43.808 --> 01:08:46.448
and she's, she's ditching prom
for the orientation of her new life.


1062
01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:51.190
Okay. So, be happy for her,
you should be supportive of her choices.


1063
01:08:51.273 --> 01:08:53.543
But her choices, they're wrong.
She’s making a huge mistake.


1064
01:08:53.567 --> 01:08:55.444
She is ruining our lives.

1065
01:08:55.945 --> 01:08:57.696
Lily, she wants a change.

1066
01:08:57.947 --> 01:09:00.699
It's not some affront
to what you guys share together.


1067
01:09:00.783 --> 01:09:02.511
- Yes, it is. That's exactly what it is.
- No...


1068
01:09:02.535 --> 01:09:04.370
No wonder she wants
to get away from you.

1069
01:09:04.912 --> 01:09:06.831
- Mom, why are you yelling at me
- Because


1070
01:09:06.914 --> 01:09:09.291
- about this?
- You're being a monster.


1071
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.003
You think you know everything?
You don't know shit.


1072
01:09:13.379 --> 01:09:16.549
Now learn your lesson
and smash your bong!


1073
01:09:19.927 --> 01:09:21.007
Really good parenting, mom.

1074
01:09:24.723 --> 01:09:26.725
Well, fuck.

1075
01:09:27.852 --> 01:09:28.936
Fuck.

1076
01:09:30.312 --> 01:09:31.312
Fuck. Fuck.

1077
01:09:33.566 --> 01:09:34.566
Fuck.

1078
01:09:42.575 --> 01:09:44.410
<i>Hey, this is Chloe.
Leave a message.</i>


1079
01:09:55.296 --> 01:10:00.593
<i>Hey, guys, it's Meils.
Uhm, I don't check my messages. So...</i>


1080
01:10:01.468 --> 01:10:03.220
<i>see you when I see you, motherfucker.</i>

1081
01:10:06.348 --> 01:10:10.895
<i>Hi, it's Rebecca. I'm not here
right now, so leave a message. Bye.</i>


1082
01:10:17.276 --> 01:10:19.361
<i>Bergbaum
-Goldwyn Residence One.</i>

1083
01:10:19.737 --> 01:10:22.323
Hi Rosa, uhm, is Chloe over there?

1084
01:10:23.073 --> 01:10:26.535
<i>Chloe, Beck, Melia. 
Where are you?</i>

1085
01:10:42.718 --> 01:10:44.158
You need any help, 
Madame President?

1086
01:10:45.054 --> 01:10:46.054
Stop.

1087
01:10:48.057 --> 01:10:50.202
I, uh, I couldn't find you
at the party the other night.


1088
01:10:50.226 --> 01:10:52.706
- I wanted to congratulate you...
- It's a little vicious, huh?


1089
01:10:52.895 --> 01:10:54.897
- What?
- You and Jessica are still involved.


1090
01:10:55.314 --> 01:10:57.209
- Don't you think that's a little hurtful?
- Jessica and I have a bond,


1091
01:10:57.233 --> 01:11:00.193
but her being completely insane keeps us
from ever being in a relationship.


1092
01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:02.570
We're not together.

1093
01:11:03.989 --> 01:11:06.659
I like spending time with you.
I care about you.


1094
01:11:06.742 --> 01:11:08.302
Yeah, well, I don't wanna be that girl.

1095
01:11:09.286 --> 01:11:12.098
Yeah, you made that pretty clear
when you blew-and-dashed the other day.


1096
01:11:12.122 --> 01:11:14.017
- You couldn't turn me down fast enough.
- Yeah, clearly,


1097
01:11:14.041 --> 01:11:17.081
because you were shoving your tongue
down your ex's throat a few hours later.


1098
01:11:17.336 --> 01:11:20.047
Wait, I wanted to be with you
and now you're jealous?


1099
01:11:20.547 --> 01:11:22.424
Oh God. Don't flatter yourself.

1100
01:11:23.717 --> 01:11:26.437
You know, for someone who's so nice,
you're actually kind of a bitch.


1101
01:11:28.472 --> 01:11:30.808
- Wow.
- Wow what?


1102
01:11:32.518 --> 01:11:33.727
Are you gonna talk to me?

1103
01:11:35.604 --> 01:11:37.648
No? Okay, awesome. Fuck you.

1104
01:11:41.860 --> 01:11:42.860
Whatever.

1105
01:12:04.717 --> 01:12:06.093
- Hey.
- Hey.


1106
01:12:08.679 --> 01:12:10.848
- What's wrong?
- Everything.


1107
01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:16.812
No, it's just prom shit. What's up?

1108
01:12:18.188 --> 01:12:19.189
Uhm...

1109
01:12:20.566 --> 01:12:22.735
It's stupid but, uhm...

1110
01:12:22.985 --> 01:12:24.653
What's Chloe's favorite color?

1111
01:12:25.612 --> 01:12:27.823
- It's for her corsage.
- She's not going.


1112
01:12:28.949 --> 01:12:34.121
Oh. And so she's, uh,
going to the pre-frosh orientation thing.


1113
01:12:34.204 --> 01:12:35.748
Yeah, right, of course you knew.

1114
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:39.251
Oh, uh, well, she had mentioned
something about it.


1115
01:12:39.752 --> 01:12:41.462
Okay. I got to go get streamers.

1116
01:12:50.471 --> 01:12:52.514
It's green, for what it's worth.

1117
01:12:53.557 --> 01:12:54.557
Thanks.

1118
01:12:55.184 --> 01:12:56.393
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.


1119
01:13:01.023 --> 01:13:02.103
What are you doing?

1120
01:13:03.317 --> 01:13:04.777
Figuring out what to wear to prom.

1121
01:13:05.944 --> 01:13:07.029
Paper bag should do.

1122
01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:09.114
Oh, you mean on your body.

1123
01:13:15.454 --> 01:13:16.454
Stop.

1124
01:13:16.747 --> 01:13:18.749
- Are you on your period?
- Yes.


1125
01:13:20.501 --> 01:13:22.581
I think that actual steam
just came out of your ears.


1126
01:13:26.507 --> 01:13:27.508
This is pretty.

1127
01:13:27.758 --> 01:13:30.302
Dude, no, do not.
You're gonna stretch it.


1128
01:13:30.386 --> 01:13:33.138
My slender boyish figure
is the stuff that trannies dream of.


1129
01:13:34.181 --> 01:13:35.181
Talk.

1130
01:13:36.558 --> 01:13:37.684
Mom's pissed at me.

1131
01:13:38.227 --> 01:13:41.063
Yeah, but you know she'll deal.
What's really going on?


1132
01:13:43.941 --> 01:13:45.150
All the girls hate me.

1133
01:13:46.026 --> 01:13:49.863
Which kind of makes sense,
I've pretty much sucked lately.


1134
01:13:50.531 --> 01:13:53.826
I mean, you are a freak. But,
uh, I mean, you've always been like that.


1135
01:13:56.078 --> 01:13:58.278
You know, I mean,
maybe you've been a bit, uh...


1136
01:13:59.123 --> 01:14:01.792
you know, like BFFAEAE this year

1137
01:14:01.875 --> 01:14:03.377
with your power pussy posse.

1138
01:14:03.961 --> 01:14:07.339
But, uh, you know,
I mean, your expiration dating.


1139
01:14:07.714 --> 01:14:10.276
You know, I mean, you taught me that.
It's like, uh, you know, like camp dude,


1140
01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:12.177
summer was over and he was like, uh,

1141
01:14:12.428 --> 01:14:14.906
he was like, "Oh, you're so hot,"
you know, "you give the best handys,


1142
01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:17.015
we're gonna AIM all the time
and all that shit."


1143
01:14:18.517 --> 01:14:21.246
It's like when you know things are ending,
you freak out, and you try to hold on


1144
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:23.689
and then it gets weird waiting it out.

1145
01:14:27.067 --> 01:14:28.652
When did you get so wise?

1146
01:14:29.778 --> 01:14:31.447
I'm surrounded by brilliant women.

1147
01:14:34.533 --> 01:14:37.369
- You got to get a new mindset.
- What? Like an emotional pre-game?


1148
01:14:37.453 --> 01:14:39.163
It's like feel shitty or be alone.

1149
01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:44.310
You know, I mean, dad left
the night before our Disneyland trip.


1150
01:14:45.043 --> 01:14:47.063
You know, we didn't go. I mean,
that shit's gonna fuck me up


1151
01:14:47.087 --> 01:14:48.881
for the rest of
my life, but it's chill.

1152
01:14:51.467 --> 01:14:52.759
C.A.R.L. 4ever

1153
01:14:53.010 --> 01:14:54.010
C.A.R.L. forever?

1154
01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:56.320
- Shut up.
- What are you, a gay trucker?


1155
01:15:02.394 --> 01:15:03.687
I'll leave you to wallow now.

1156
01:15:06.565 --> 01:15:07.649
- Take it off.
- Nope.


1157
01:15:16.783 --> 01:15:18.160
Hi, Robert, it's Jill.

1158
01:15:20.287 --> 01:15:24.541
Just calling, 'cause our daughter's
high school graduation is coming up...


1159
01:15:27.461 --> 01:15:28.629
Valedictorian.

1160
01:15:30.088 --> 01:15:31.131
Speech.

1161
01:15:32.382 --> 01:15:34.384
Gonna be a, a big one.

1162
01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:38.472
Yeah, could make up
for all the others that you missed,


1163
01:15:39.139 --> 01:15:42.684
maybe. Olivia and James are, are well.
They're becoming really...


1164
01:15:44.311 --> 01:15:47.773
just wonderful, smart people.

1165
01:15:47.898 --> 01:15:50.192
I think you'd really like them.

1166
01:15:52.611 --> 01:15:54.488
I do. I think you'd really like them.

1167
01:15:55.906 --> 01:16:00.744
Anyway, I'd say talk soon, but I think
we both know that's not gonna happen.


1168
01:16:00.827 --> 01:16:06.500
Okay? All right. Graduation, Tuesday.
If you give a shit, go fuck yourself.


1169
01:16:06.583 --> 01:16:09.962
Okay. Okay, goodbye.
Go fuck... Yeah. Go fuck yourself.


1170
01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:12.673

1193
01:19:00.257 --> 01:19:01.818
I can't believe
we're at prom though.


1194
01:19:01.842 --> 01:19:03.176
Thank God we got invited.

1195
01:19:03.343 --> 01:19:05.446
- But I need to be way more drunk.
- Me, too.


1196
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:09.516
Oh. Slow your roll, girls,
the night is long.


1197
01:19:11.059 --> 01:19:12.059
Whiskey?

1198
01:19:13.729 --> 01:19:14.729
Why not?

1199
01:19:27.033 --> 01:19:27.951
- Hi.
- What's up?


1200
01:19:28.034 --> 01:19:29.995
You, uh, you look beautiful.

1201
01:19:30.704 --> 01:19:33.582
- You look beautiful.
- All right, thank you.


1202
01:19:33.665 --> 01:19:36.465
Uhm, look, I just really wanted
to apologize for, for getting all weird


1203
01:19:36.501 --> 01:19:38.661
and walking away from you
the other day in the library.


1204
01:19:38.754 --> 01:19:42.340
Loans categorically suck
and I'm still paying mine off.


1205
01:19:42.424 --> 01:19:46.428
So, you know, If you ever wanna talk,
I can imagine it's not the kind of thing


1206
01:19:46.511 --> 01:19:48.847
that gets,
gets a lot of attention around here.


1207
01:19:49.014 --> 01:19:52.893
Yeah, it's not really a big topic of
conversation amongst my friends. You know.


1208
01:19:53.143 --> 01:19:57.189
But, uhm, it's very cool
that you are dealing with it now.


1209
01:19:58.231 --> 01:19:59.733
- Got to do it, so...
- Yeah.


1210
01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.735
How's, uh, how's your date?

1211
01:20:02.903 --> 01:20:06.448
Uhm, it was just supposed
to be us girls, but things are changing.


1212
01:20:06.531 --> 01:20:09.034
Everyone's leaving, it's weird, you know.

1213
01:20:09.242 --> 01:20:12.496
Well, what endures
when all else has changed?


1214
01:20:12.704 --> 01:20:14.498
- It is love.
- It is love. Kierkegaard.


1215
01:20:14.581 --> 01:20:16.249
- Hm-mmm.
- I love that guy.


1216
01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:17.750
- Yeah.
- You know, poet.


1217
01:20:18.001 --> 01:20:20.629
Well, look, just tell them
your love hasn't changed.


1218
01:20:21.171 --> 01:20:22.672
You'll only get so many chances.

1219
01:20:29.721 --> 01:20:32.724
- You sad about leaving?
- Not really.


1220
01:20:33.892 --> 01:20:35.519
I'm just glad I have another year here.

1221
01:20:36.353 --> 01:20:38.104
I can't imagine leaving this place.

1222
01:20:56.873 --> 01:20:57.999
<i>What are we doing?</i>

1223
01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:04.130
You're leaving in a couple of months.
I, I don't know what Chloe's gonna do.


1224
01:21:04.256 --> 01:21:07.175
Hey, Lil, this isn't some fling.

1225
01:21:11.388 --> 01:21:12.388
I love you.

1226
01:21:14.724 --> 01:21:15.724
Hey.

1227
01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:19.563
Hey.

1228
01:21:23.650 --> 01:21:24.776
You came back.

1229
01:21:27.028 --> 01:21:31.199
Mr. Bemis: What's a fart that sounds
and smells like nothing? A Sartre


1230
01:21:33.618 --> 01:21:34.661
I hate boys.

1231
01:21:35.036 --> 01:21:37.539
I know. We're ready for men.

1232
01:21:37.956 --> 01:21:41.543
No. You know what I need right now?
I need my dudes, where the fuck is Lily?


1233
01:21:41.626 --> 01:21:43.920
I don't know. I
wish Clo was here, too.

1234
01:21:44.671 --> 01:21:46.256
I miss our token white friends.

1235
01:21:46.882 --> 01:21:48.174
I know, it's ironic.

1236
01:21:56.641 --> 01:21:57.809
This just...

1237
01:21:59.686 --> 01:22:02.230
- Wasn't we had planned?
- Wasn't us.


1238
01:22:04.774 --> 01:22:07.068
God, that fuckhead Mike's in there.

1239
01:22:10.530 --> 01:22:13.241
They have fucked me up, just fucked up.

1240
01:22:14.826 --> 01:22:17.996
Lil, whatever happened
with that guy, I just...


1241
01:22:21.291 --> 01:22:22.417
I'm really sorry.

1242
01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:26.171
I'm sorry.

1243
01:22:30.216 --> 01:22:32.052
I think I'm so fucking well-adjusted.

1244
01:22:32.135 --> 01:22:35.180
I'm not, I'm just this,
like, Stepford wife control freak.


1245
01:22:36.097 --> 01:22:37.140
I'm crazy.

1246
01:22:41.186 --> 01:22:43.855
And I'm so sorry
for being so intense about Thomas.


1247
01:22:47.150 --> 01:22:48.610
I just wanted to be sad together.

1248
01:22:50.654 --> 01:22:53.406
I get it, sometimes you don't wanna talk,
and he's not my brother,


1249
01:22:53.490 --> 01:22:55.810
and just because I was in love with him,
it doesn't mean...


1250
01:22:56.576 --> 01:22:58.495
He was in love with you, too, Lil.

1251
01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.163
I know.

1252
01:23:00.956 --> 01:23:02.582
He wrote me a letter about it.

1253
01:23:05.085 --> 01:23:06.336
Look, Lil...

1254
01:23:09.422 --> 01:23:10.966
It's gonna hurt forever.

1255
01:23:13.843 --> 01:23:15.345
It's part of who we are now.

1256
01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:20.350
Mourning what was

1257
01:23:21.518 --> 01:23:22.686
and what is,

1258
01:23:23.895 --> 01:23:25.438
is sad enough, Lil.

1259
01:23:27.315 --> 01:23:30.360
I just, I can't take on mourning
something that could have been.


1260
01:23:32.779 --> 01:23:36.574
And, you know, whatever it is,
whatever is gonna happen,


1261
01:23:37.701 --> 01:23:39.077
we're still gonna be us.

1262
01:23:44.332 --> 01:23:45.625
You're my life partner.

1263
01:23:56.594 --> 01:23:58.304
I'm sorry about your prom.

1264
01:23:59.264 --> 01:24:01.307
No, you are my prom.

1265
01:24:08.231 --> 01:24:09.441
Ready?

1266
01:24:18.742 --> 01:24:21.286
Oh! Look who decided to show.

1267
01:24:22.579 --> 01:24:24.219
- Come on, I couldn't miss prom.
- Hm-mmm.


1268
01:24:24.289 --> 01:24:27.292
Guys, I'm really sorry
for being such a psycho.


1269
01:24:27.459 --> 01:24:28.752
- It's okay.
- Yeah, it's okay.


1270
01:24:28.835 --> 01:24:30.715
You're like
the obsessive boyfriend I never had.


1271
01:24:31.463 --> 01:24:34.174
What is never changed
when everything's changed?


1272
01:24:34.841 --> 01:24:35.884
It is love.

1273
01:24:36.301 --> 01:24:38.511
Oh. I love you.

1274
01:24:38.636 --> 01:24:41.848
Now, I don't know what's gonna happen,
but I've got you guys,


1275
01:24:41.931 --> 01:24:45.018
- and that is pretty fucking good.
- Yeah, girl.


1276
01:24:45.351 --> 01:24:46.591
- Let's blow this joint.
- Yeah.


1277
01:24:46.644 --> 01:24:48.396
- Yes.
- Prom sucks.


1278
01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:49.480
- Yeah.
- Let's go.


1279
01:24:49.522 --> 01:24:50.523
Yes.

1280
01:24:59.407 --> 01:25:01.010
Have you seen the video
that she's talking about?


1281
01:25:01.034 --> 01:25:03.036
- No.
- It, it's the best.


1282
01:25:03.119 --> 01:25:06.498
- ...your fucking phone. Asshole.
- Why were you looking at my phone?


1283
01:25:06.581 --> 01:25:07.941
You can't look in my phone.

1284
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:12.796
Hey, remember me?

1285
01:25:14.422 --> 01:25:16.257
Hey, how's it go...

1286
01:25:17.258 --> 01:25:20.095
- Oh!
- Shit!


1287
01:25:20.178 --> 01:25:22.013
- Go fuck yourself.
- Fuck, yeah!


1288
01:25:22.097 --> 01:25:23.765
That was awesome.

1289
01:25:23.848 --> 01:25:25.767
- Yeah. You can't fucking look...
- Fuck you.


1290
01:25:31.106 --> 01:25:34.067
- Hey.
- Shit, sorry you had to see that.


1291
01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.486
Everything okay?

1292
01:25:38.071 --> 01:25:42.617
Uhm, she's mad that I have a phone...

1293
01:25:43.535 --> 01:25:44.577
I guess.

1294
01:25:46.746 --> 01:25:49.946
I don't know. She's fucking crazy, man.
I shouldn't have brought her, that was...


1295
01:25:50.458 --> 01:25:51.501
a bad idea.

1296
01:25:53.378 --> 01:25:56.589
I have been such a dick to you
and I, I'm really sorry.


1297
01:25:56.673 --> 01:25:58.967
I didn't mean to be. 
And I'm really sorry.

1298
01:25:59.801 --> 01:26:02.720
Noah, I've been kind of dick-like, too.

1299
01:26:05.181 --> 01:26:07.725
- Dickishness forgiven?
- Yeah.


1300
01:26:08.852 --> 01:26:11.604
Great. Come on. Let's go.

1301
01:26:14.858 --> 01:26:17.193
- Yay!
- Yo, now the party's here.


1302
01:26:40.633 --> 01:26:41.968
Last ones to leave,

1303
01:26:42.468 --> 01:26:43.511
classy girls.

1304
01:26:44.304 --> 01:26:45.638
Savoring every moment.

1305
01:26:47.056 --> 01:26:48.784
All right, ladies.
Let's get the fuck out of here.


1306
01:26:48.808 --> 01:26:51.968
Oh, wait, wait, let me get a picture of you. - Oh, seriously?
- Yes.


1307
01:26:52.395 --> 01:26:53.664
- Yeah.
- So let's take pictures,


1308
01:26:53.688 --> 01:26:54.748
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, okay.


1309
01:26:54.772 --> 01:26:57.108
Oh, that's good. All right.
Freeze it, hold it.


1310
01:26:58.818 --> 01:27:00.361
She smashed brother's Donkey Bong?

1311
01:27:01.362 --> 01:27:02.405
Donkey Bong,

1312
01:27:02.989 --> 01:27:08.620
there with us through high school,
life, death, SATs, prom,


1313
01:27:09.537 --> 01:27:12.790
we only had a little bit of weed, but we
wanted to get, like, really, really high.


1314
01:27:13.333 --> 01:27:18.588
We bury you next to your brethren,
Jon Bong Jovi, Sean Bongery,


1315
01:27:19.339 --> 01:27:22.926
Bong Connery, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe."

1316
01:27:26.346 --> 01:27:27.472
You will be missed.

1317
01:27:32.268 --> 01:27:33.311
Oh.

1318
01:27:40.652 --> 01:27:41.736
Now, what do we do?

1319
01:27:42.403 --> 01:27:47.909
Hmm, I have to finish my grad speech,
but I almost don't give a fuck.


1320
01:27:48.243 --> 01:27:49.327
What do you have so far?

1321
01:27:50.411 --> 01:27:52.413
Mmm, I'm writing that on my phone.

1322
01:27:54.666 --> 01:27:57.085
- Well, stand up. Do it for us.
- Yeah.


1323
01:27:57.543 --> 01:28:00.505
- Hmm?
- Lily, Lily.


1324
01:28:00.672 --> 01:28:04.842
Okay. I've tried to put a name
on what I'm feeling.


1325
01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:08.888
It has to do with fear,
of the unknown, of change.


1326
01:28:10.431 --> 01:28:11.307
It's wrapped up in memory,

1327
01:28:11.391 --> 01:28:14.310
being in the places
that have contained your life.


1328
01:28:14.686 --> 01:28:16.521
It has the sense of too-soon nostalgia,

1329
01:28:16.604 --> 01:28:19.274
as if I deeply long
for what's right in front of me.


1330
01:28:19.399 --> 01:28:21.484
Then a friend said it, loss.

1331
01:28:22.443 --> 01:28:25.905
Is that what I'm feeling,
what it means to grow up?


1332
01:28:26.948 --> 01:28:28.283
Your growing familiarity

1333
01:28:28.366 --> 01:28:31.536
with an acceptance
of the pain of life's losses?


1334
01:28:32.245 --> 01:28:36.332
<i>Growing up is understanding
what eases that pain, friendship.</i>


1335
01:28:37.083 --> 01:28:39.961
<i>A bond fused by tears, traumas,</i>

1336
01:28:40.086 --> 01:28:43.589
<i>hours logged in the same cars,
in front of the same TVs.</i>


1337
01:28:44.632 --> 01:28:46.832
<i>All of our memories
are wrapped up in each other.</i>


1338
01:28:47.635 --> 01:28:49.929
<i>It's the greatest gift
this place has given us,</i>


1339
01:28:50.013 --> 01:28:51.764
<i>and it's part of our loss today.</i>

1340
01:28:52.682 --> 01:28:55.977
<i>But the poet, Robert Penn Warren
gave a better definition of loss,</i>


1341
01:28:56.394 --> 01:28:58.521
<i>what loss can be
if we approach it right.</i>

1342
01:28:59.314 --> 01:29:02.567
<i>"The process whereby

1344
01:29:13.536 --> 01:29:14.746
Mr. Bemis.

1345
01:29:15.872 --> 01:29:17.415
- Hi.
- Hey.


1346
01:29:19.542 --> 01:29:23.963
- Okay, uh, call me Immanuel.
- Immanuel? Really?


1347
01:29:24.130 --> 01:29:26.507
- Hm-mmm.
- Uhm, thank you for the flowers.


1348
01:29:26.591 --> 01:29:27.759
I'm glad you came.

1349
01:29:30.011 --> 01:29:31.929
God, what am I gonna do without you?

1350
01:29:32.847 --> 01:29:36.559
- You're the reason I come to school.
- Me, too. For you.


1351
01:29:39.437 --> 01:29:40.772
Look, I know it's wrong.

1352
01:29:42.023 --> 01:29:45.109
I'm 18, though.
Look, I just graduated, so...


1353
01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:50.740
I'm, I'm 24, but I have
the emotional maturity of like a 20 or...


1354
01:29:50.823 --> 01:29:51.884
- Right. Right. Right.
- maximum.


1355
01:29:51.908 --> 01:29:53.701
- Come, come meet my mom.
- Wow, uh...


1356
01:29:53.785 --> 01:29:58.956
I'm nervous. All right.
In the middle? Immanuel Bemis.


1357
01:30:03.961 --> 01:30:06.297
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I'm gonna get all of us.


1358
01:30:06.631 --> 01:30:09.550
- Amelia.
- Rosa.


1359
01:30:09.842 --> 01:30:13.346
Your brownies are so delicious,
everybody loves them.


1360
01:30:13.930 --> 01:30:16.224
Where did you, where did you get this?

1361
01:30:17.141 --> 01:30:19.143
Damn, I love to chill, dude.

1362
01:30:19.769 --> 01:30:21.521
- Hi.
- Congratulations.


1363
01:30:21.604 --> 01:30:24.107
You killed your speech.
I was crying the whole time.


1364
01:30:24.190 --> 01:30:25.793
- Thank you.
- Thanks. Yeah. It was great.


1365
01:30:25.817 --> 01:30:28.003
- Are we still on for dinner tomorrow?
- Yeah, motherfucker.


1366
01:30:28.027 --> 01:30:31.072
My mom is currently basting
the brisket as we speak, so, yeah.


1367
01:30:31.155 --> 01:30:32.240
- Amazing.
- Great.


1368
01:30:32.365 --> 01:30:34.200
Lily, I wanna get a family photo.

1369
01:30:34.617 --> 01:30:37.078
Okay. Go photo. I'm gonna stay here
and to really eat


1370
01:30:37.161 --> 01:30:41.081
- every single one of these brownies. - Okay. - Hey, guys.
- Go. Okay, wait, here she comes.


1371
01:30:50.466 --> 01:30:52.402
- All right. Go. Go. Go. Get in there.
- You just literally ruin it.


1372
01:30:52.426 --> 01:30:53.636
- Do something.
- Whoa.


1373
01:30:53.886 --> 01:30:56.347
- I'm sorry.
- Do something, uhm, adorable.


1374
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:58.099
The monkeys. The monkeys.

1375
01:30:58.683 --> 01:31:00.268
- Aw. Do it.
- The monkeys.


1376
01:31:00.726 --> 01:31:02.895
Oh, there it is. There it is.

1377
01:31:03.271 --> 01:31:06.232
Good one. And we'll do that thing
where you guys hit a hundred times.


1378
01:31:06.315 --> 01:31:07.984
- And enough now. Come with me.
- Perfect.


1379
01:31:09.152 --> 01:31:10.462
- How are you doing?
- Little bro.


1380
01:31:10.486 --> 01:31:12.905
- How do you feel about everything?
- Free. I made it.


1381
01:31:13.406 --> 01:31:15.676
- And you're gonna miss the shit out of me.
- Do you feel all right about it?


1382
01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:17.785
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.


1383
01:31:24.250 --> 01:31:25.293
What?

1384
01:31:26.169 --> 01:31:32.341
Rosa may have served the brownies
that I made for our private after party.


1385
01:31:32.425 --> 01:31:33.426
- What?
- What?


1386
01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:35.303
Just look.

1387
01:31:36.137 --> 01:31:38.764
- But how much weed's in them?
- Like an ounce.


1388
01:31:38.848 --> 01:31:39.682
- An ounce?
- Fuck.


1389
01:31:39.765 --> 01:31:41.392
- Maybe like four ounces.
- Four ounces?


1390
01:31:41.475 --> 01:31:43.728
- I thought we deserve to get high.
- Oh my God.


1391
01:31:44.145 --> 01:31:49.483
Your heads are so huge
in a good way.


1392
01:31:50.651 --> 01:31:52.612
Okay. Thanks, Rosa.
