2
00:00:21.548 --> 00:00:23.984
I'm here outside Bend, Oregon.

3
00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:25.386
Uh...

4
00:00:25.418 --> 00:00:28.788
and there's a big old
solar facility right here.


5
00:00:28.822 --> 00:00:31.659
"High voltage. Keep out.
Authorized personnel."


6
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:32.793
What's going on back here?

7
00:00:33.727 --> 00:00:35.895
They don't want you
breaking into these places,


8
00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.066
but I'm in the facility now,
so you can see this up close.


9
00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:42.335
You'll notice this is all dusty.

10
00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:45.038
So, these... these things have
to be cleaned pretty regularly.


11
00:00:45.072 --> 00:00:47.874
So, most people don't realize
that solar panels


12
00:00:47.907 --> 00:00:51.679
and solar power facilities
are actually huge water users.


13
00:00:51.712 --> 00:00:55.115
Um, and they like to
install them in desert areas,


14
00:00:55.148 --> 00:00:56.850
where water use
is already a big problem.


15
00:00:57.618 --> 00:01:01.054
Um, these elements are made of
silicon, which is mined and refined,


16
00:01:01.087 --> 00:01:04.325
using extremely high temperature
destructive processes.


17
00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:07.995
Then they're mounted on
these big steel pipes here.


18
00:01:08.028 --> 00:01:11.999
Look at this. I mean, this is just an
industrial energy production facility.


19
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:15.502
It... it has nothing to do with
saving the planet whatsoever.


20
00:01:15.535 --> 00:01:17.704
Uh, it may have a slightly lar...

21
00:01:17.737 --> 00:01:20.507
lower carbon footprint
than fossil fuels,


22
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.810
but of course, this all
requires fossil fuels to create.


23
00:01:23.844 --> 00:01:26.514
Um, the steel was
all made using coal.


24
00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:31.051
All this material was trucked here
using diesel... diesel trucks,


25
00:01:31.084 --> 00:01:35.055
extracted all over the world using
massive mining trucks, powered by diesel.


26
00:01:35.088 --> 00:01:37.392
Uh, smelted using fossil fuels.

27
00:01:38.424 --> 00:01:42.963
Assembled at plants
likely powered by fossil fuels.


28
00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:46.900
And, uh... And all of this
destroys the planet,


29
00:01:46.933 --> 00:01:48.402
no matter where
the power comes from.


30
00:01:49.203 --> 00:01:51.906
So, this shit ain't green.

31
00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:02.450
<i>We are told that we can
have our cake and eat it too.</i>


32
00:02:02.483 --> 00:02:05.486
<i>That we can maintain
a high energy lifestyle,</i>


33
00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:07.487
<i>without destroying the planet.</i>

34
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.125
<i>We are told that solar,
wind, hydro and biomass</i>


35
00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.929
<i>are clean,
green and sustainable.</i>


36
00:02:15.828 --> 00:02:18.498
<i>What they don't talk about,
are the unseen harms</i>


37
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:20.301
<i>caused by these technologies.</i>

38
00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:24.005
<i>The processes
which take place out of sight.</i>


39
00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:29.944
<i>People rarely question the solutions
they are taught to embrace.</i>


40
00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:31.778
<i>But with all the world at stake,</i>

41
00:02:31.811 --> 00:02:34.281
<i>we must start
asking the right questions.</i>


42
00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:38.751
<i>There is a push
for a 100% renewable world.</i>


43
00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:41.422
<i>And after the research
I've done for this documentary,</i>


44
00:02:42.221 --> 00:02:43.558
<i>I want no part of it.</i>

45
00:02:45.325 --> 00:02:47.761
<i>I did not become
an environmentalist</i>


46
00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:49.897
<i>to protect my way of life,</i>

47
00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:52.165
<i>or the civilization
in which I live.</i>


48
00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:57.004
<i>I did it because I am in love
with life on this planet,</i>


49
00:02:57.036 --> 00:02:59.673
<i>and because the world
I love is under assault.</i>


50
00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:04.043
<i>This film is for
those whose allegiance</i>


51
00:03:04.077 --> 00:03:05.546
<i>is with the living world.</i>

52
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.316
<i>Those who would do
whatever it takes to defend it.</i>


53
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.857
The environmental
movement used to be


54
00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.494
a very impassioned
group of people who cared deeply


55
00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:24.163
about the places we loved
and the creatures we loved.


56
00:03:24.196 --> 00:03:26.199
What's happened, though,
in my lifetime is that,


57
00:03:26.232 --> 00:03:29.636
this movement that was
so honorable and so impassioned


58
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.571
has turned into something
completely different.


59
00:03:31.605 --> 00:03:35.676
And now it's about protecting
a destructive way of life...


60
00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.946
while it destroys the creatures
and the places that we love.


61
00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.816
It's all become, "How do we
continue to fuel this destruction?"


62
00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.022
As if the only problem, was the
fact that we were using oil and gas?


63
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:51.157
You will have
hundreds of thousands of people


64
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.061
marching in the streets of
Washington or New York or Paris.


65
00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:58.766
And if you ask those individuals,
"Why are you marching?"


66
00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.702
They will say,
"We want to save the planet."


67
00:04:01.734 --> 00:04:04.505
And if you ask them for
their demands, they will say,


68
00:04:04.537 --> 00:04:06.940
"We want subsidies for the wind
and solar industries."


69
00:04:07.641 --> 00:04:09.510
That's extraordinary.

70
00:04:09.542 --> 00:04:12.245
I can't think of
any time in history,


71
00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:16.517
when any mass movement has been
so completely captured...


72
00:04:17.217 --> 00:04:20.588
and turned into lobbyists
for an industry.


73
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:23.591
Frankly, solar, hydro, all them,

74
00:04:23.624 --> 00:04:27.361
do a great big fuck all
to stop global warming.


75
00:04:27.393 --> 00:04:30.663
But what they do is,
they make us think


76
00:04:30.696 --> 00:04:32.232
we are accomplishing something,

77
00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:35.536
while certain sectors
of industry... get rich.


78
00:04:36.802 --> 00:04:40.040
The natural world isn't really
part of the conversation anymore.


79
00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:42.676
You know, Kumi Naidoo,
the former head of Greenpeace,


80
00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:44.612
I was watching him
being interviewed the other day


81
00:04:44.645 --> 00:04:47.481
and he was saying, you know, "Look,
the planet's going to survive,


82
00:04:47.513 --> 00:04:50.117
the oceans are going to survive,
forests are going to survive.


83
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.020
It's really about,
'Can we save ourselves or not?'"


84
00:04:53.052 --> 00:04:56.089
And I just saw that and I'm thinking,
"What the hell are you saying?"


85
00:04:56.122 --> 00:04:57.992
This is somebody
who is considered to be,


86
00:04:58.025 --> 00:05:00.394
you know, one of the top environmentalists
in the world and he's saying,


87
00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:02.696
"We don't have to worry
about the forest or the oceans."


88
00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.133
I mean, to me, that just betrays
a complete lack of empathy


89
00:05:06.165 --> 00:05:08.201
and connection
to the natural world.


90
00:05:08.234 --> 00:05:10.470
I don't know how
you could possibly say that,


91
00:05:10.504 --> 00:05:13.974
when we're in the midst of
the sixth great mass extinction.


92
00:05:14.006 --> 00:05:16.343
And it's being caused
by industrial culture.


93
00:05:17.044 --> 00:05:19.279
It's being caused
by the same institutions,


94
00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:22.482
the same economies, the same
systems, the same raw materials.


95
00:05:22.516 --> 00:05:25.218
The same extractive mindset

96
00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:28.355
that is being used for these
renewable energy technologies.


97
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.027
<i>Bright Green environmentalism
is founded on the notion that</i>


98
00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:35.762
<i>technology will solve
environmental problems</i>


99
00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:39.732
<i>and that you can,
through 100% recycling,</i>


100
00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:42.636
<i>through wind and solar power</i>

101
00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.774
<i>have an industrial economy
that does not harm the planet.</i>


102
00:05:46.807 --> 00:05:50.944
<i>Deep ecology is the belief
that we need to radically change</i>


103
00:05:50.977 --> 00:05:53.914
<i>the way society functions,
in order to be sustainable.</i>


104
00:06:02.588 --> 00:06:03.723
<i>I'm in New Hampshire,</i>

105
00:06:03.756 --> 00:06:06.093
<i>getting ready to film
a clear-cut.</i>


106
00:06:06.126 --> 00:06:09.196
<i>The activist I'm meeting
sent footage he captured,</i>


107
00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:11.198
<i>of animals
who live in the forest.</i>


108
00:06:27.547 --> 00:06:29.883
<i>All these creatures
who live here...</i>


109
00:06:29.915 --> 00:06:31.951
<i>their homes are being destroyed,</i>

110
00:06:31.984 --> 00:06:34.588
<i>to provide so-called
"green energy,"</i>


111
00:06:34.621 --> 00:06:36.390
<i>in the form of biomass.</i>

112
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:39.992
<i>Biomass is one of the
big, dirty secrets</i>


113
00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.629
<i>of the Bright Green movement.</i>

114
00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:48.635
<i>What biomass is, is simply
a fancy word for burning stuff.</i>


115
00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:53.674
<i>What they're doing is, they are cutting
down forests all over the world,</i>


116
00:06:53.706 --> 00:06:57.643
<i>and burning them
and calling this biomass,</i>


117
00:06:57.677 --> 00:07:00.948
<i>calling this renewable,
calling this carbon neutral.</i>


118
00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:07.987
<i>They will talk about how, "Oh, renewables
are growing X percent every year."</i>


119
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.189
<i>But what they never talk about
is that, for example,</i>


120
00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:13.193
<i>in their German miracle,
majority of the increase</i>


121
00:07:13.225 --> 00:07:15.428
<i>in so called renewables
is biomass.</i>


122
00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:17.530
<i>It's not wind and solar,
like they talk about.</i>


123
00:07:17.564 --> 00:07:19.398
<i>That's because they don't
really want to talk about</i>


124
00:07:19.432 --> 00:07:21.335
<i>the fact that their so-called
"renewable energy"</i>


125
00:07:21.367 --> 00:07:22.769
<i>is simply cutting down forests.</i>

126
00:07:29.475 --> 00:07:31.711
- So they sell these timber sales?
- Yep.


127
00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:34.681
Last year, they got revenue

128
00:07:34.713 --> 00:07:38.751
- of about $550,000.
- Okay.


129
00:07:38.785 --> 00:07:41.522
Their timber
program costs at least


130
00:07:41.554 --> 00:07:43.523
three million dollars
to implement.


131
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:47.427
Not only are they
removing our trees,


132
00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.996
not only are they removing
the only thing we have


133
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.299
to sequester carbon
on this Earth...


134
00:07:54.167 --> 00:07:56.102
- but we pay for it.
- Wow!


135
00:07:56.903 --> 00:07:58.939
- That's insane.
- It is insane.


136
00:07:58.972 --> 00:08:01.341
It's completely insane.

137
00:08:01.374 --> 00:08:02.775
And people don't...

138
00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:04.578
You t... explain that...
you tell people that,


139
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.214
and they're like,
"No..." Yeah! Absolutely.


140
00:08:08.247 --> 00:08:11.083
We... we, the US taxpayers...

141
00:08:11.117 --> 00:08:14.121
...subsidize these guys,
to kill trees.


142
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:18.225
The problem we have right now,
and... and the thing I always


143
00:08:18.258 --> 00:08:20.761
fight these guys on is that,

144
00:08:20.794 --> 00:08:22.563
- we have a carbon problem right now.
- Yeah.


145
00:08:22.595 --> 00:08:25.298
- You know, we're at 400 parts per million or whatever it is.
- Yeah.


146
00:08:25.331 --> 00:08:28.034
So, you know, that...
and they'll say, "Well,


147
00:08:28.068 --> 00:08:29.803
yeah, but that tree
will regrow."


148
00:08:29.835 --> 00:08:32.138
Yeah, but that's

149
00:08:32.172 --> 00:08:33.707
- Mm-hmm.
- Where are we going to be then?


150
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:35.676
- 600 parts per million? I don't know.
- Yeah.


151
00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:37.444
But if you
leave that tree there,


152
00:08:37.477 --> 00:08:38.879
that tree is going to continue,

153
00:08:38.911 --> 00:08:41.480
not only to sequester the carbon
that's in it right now...


154
00:08:41.514 --> 00:08:44.618
- Mm-hmm.
- ...but the carbon that, in the next 100 years...


155
00:08:45.385 --> 00:08:47.487
- Right.
- ...that it would have taken to rep...


156
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.756
you know, 100 plus years
to replace that tree.


157
00:08:49.789 --> 00:08:53.460
- It's sequestering that much more carbon in that one tree.
- Mm-hmm.


158
00:08:53.492 --> 00:08:57.363
- Yeah. Just totally sets you back to remove it.
- So...


159
00:08:57.396 --> 00:08:59.665
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
So, I mean, that's what...


160
00:08:59.698 --> 00:09:01.434
that's what makes...
you know, so then you go


161
00:09:01.468 --> 00:09:03.136
to the whole thing
of whole-tree harvesting,


162
00:09:03.169 --> 00:09:05.572
where not only do they take
the bole of the tree,


163
00:09:05.604 --> 00:09:08.741
they take everything, you know,
that's removing everything


164
00:09:08.775 --> 00:09:10.910
from the... from the...
the equation.


165
00:09:10.944 --> 00:09:12.445
Yeah, and then
you burn it for biomass.


166
00:09:12.478 --> 00:09:14.647
And then and then you
burn it and it goes poof!

167
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.883
And all that carbon
is instant released


168
00:09:16.916 --> 00:09:19.185
into the atmosphere that's
already overloaded with carbon.


169
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.089
It's kind of like a spider web.

170
00:09:22.121 --> 00:09:24.123
You have
all these trails going off.


171
00:09:25.424 --> 00:09:27.294
That's the beginning
of the clear-cut.


172
00:09:27.327 --> 00:09:28.862
I mean, you walk out the thing

173
00:09:28.895 --> 00:09:30.463
and... and it's going
to hit you in the face.


174
00:09:33.232 --> 00:09:38.838
An old forest has carbon
as part of the trees.


175
00:09:38.871 --> 00:09:41.507
The soil, the branches.

176
00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.477
That's all carbon that is...
is currently sequestered


177
00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:47.680
and is not going out
into the atmosphere.


178
00:09:47.713 --> 00:09:49.248
You cut that tree down.

179
00:09:49.281 --> 00:09:51.751
Not only does it
stop sequestering carbon,


180
00:09:51.785 --> 00:09:55.588
but it actually starts emitting
carbon from the soil that's left,


181
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:57.524
because the soil
has been disturbed.


182
00:09:59.159 --> 00:10:01.995
To generate
a unit of electricity,


183
00:10:02.027 --> 00:10:07.066
biomass will release more carbon
than coal will...


184
00:10:08.168 --> 00:10:10.104
and coal's plenty dirty enough.

185
00:10:11.203 --> 00:10:14.875
We're looking at the aftermath
of a 245 acre...


186
00:10:14.908 --> 00:10:17.878
whole-tree harvest
liquidation cut,


187
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:22.181
where effectively, they removed
all of the above ground biomass.


188
00:10:22.214 --> 00:10:25.484
Almost all the trees. They left
a couple of pine here and there,


189
00:10:25.517 --> 00:10:27.753
uh, one or two little patches
that they didn't cut,


190
00:10:27.786 --> 00:10:31.458
but effectively,
it's a 245 acre clear-cut.


191
00:10:31.491 --> 00:10:33.492
To call it carbon neutral,

192
00:10:33.525 --> 00:10:36.729
you have to do some
pretty dishonest accounting.


193
00:10:36.762 --> 00:10:38.264
For instance,
the European Union...


194
00:10:38.964 --> 00:10:41.834
doesn't count the carbon
it released in its burning


195
00:10:41.867 --> 00:10:46.138
in its calculations,
whereas the American forests


196
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:48.908
that are supplying the carbon

197
00:10:48.942 --> 00:10:53.213
don't count the carbon they're
releasing during the harvesting.


198
00:10:53.246 --> 00:10:57.417
Now, the justification is,
we don't want to count it twice,


199
00:10:57.449 --> 00:11:00.152
so we don't count it at all.
And now it's carbon neutral.


200
00:11:00.185 --> 00:11:02.254
We got to count at once, folks.
And when you count at once,


201
00:11:02.288 --> 00:11:04.958
it doesn't matter whether
it's the carbon released


202
00:11:04.991 --> 00:11:07.461
from the burning of it,
or whether you count


203
00:11:07.493 --> 00:11:11.230
the carbon stored in that forest
that you've liquidated,


204
00:11:11.264 --> 00:11:14.067
because now
it's going to be burned


205
00:11:14.099 --> 00:11:17.269
and it's going to be released.
So, uh, I guess I...


206
00:11:17.303 --> 00:11:20.374
I'm not comfortable with
an industry that deceives me,


207
00:11:20.406 --> 00:11:22.341
about something
as important as climate change.


208
00:11:24.944 --> 00:11:26.612
<i>As forests get older...</i>

209
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.549
<i>they sequester
more and more carbon.</i>


210
00:11:29.582 --> 00:11:31.718
<i>They sequester more
and more carbon per year.</i>


211
00:11:32.819 --> 00:11:34.721
<i>Every time
you cut down the forest,</i>


212
00:11:34.753 --> 00:11:38.924
<i>you are
removing lots of biomass,</i>


213
00:11:38.958 --> 00:11:41.560
<i>and you're
removing lots of nutrients.</i>


214
00:11:41.593 --> 00:11:44.664
<i>You're completely
stressing out the forest.</i>


215
00:11:44.697 --> 00:11:47.634
<i>You're removing
all those who live there,</i>


216
00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:51.104
<i>and you are somehow
expecting it to recover.</i>


217
00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:56.309
<i>I love the line by John Livingston,
"There is no surplus in nature."</i>


218
00:11:56.342 --> 00:11:59.746
<i>Every tree that's taken out
was a home for someone else</i>


219
00:11:59.779 --> 00:12:01.248
<i>and was food for someone else.</i>

220
00:12:21.233 --> 00:12:24.570
<i>Bright Green environmentalists
love pointing out examples</i>


221
00:12:24.603 --> 00:12:26.973
<i>of countries that have switched
to renewable energy,</i>


222
00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:31.211
<i>but there are a lot of
inconsistencies in these claims.</i>


223
00:12:31.243 --> 00:12:34.513
<i>One problem is that they
will often imply this energy</i>


224
00:12:34.546 --> 00:12:36.682
<i>comes from solar and wind,</i>

225
00:12:36.716 --> 00:12:39.852
<i>when the majority of this
so-called "green energy"</i>


226
00:12:39.886 --> 00:12:41.020
<i>comes from hydro.</i>

227
00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:44.156
Hydro is incredibly destructive.

228
00:12:44.189 --> 00:12:47.194
Dams destroy
the regions below the dam.


229
00:12:47.227 --> 00:12:49.696
They destroy
the river above the dam.


230
00:12:49.728 --> 00:12:52.799
They kill the fish, who can no
longer move up and down the river.


231
00:12:52.832 --> 00:12:54.867
Dams increase
the water temperature.


232
00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.902
And then to sort of
top all this off,


233
00:12:56.935 --> 00:12:59.805
dams are claimed
to be carbon neutral,


234
00:12:59.838 --> 00:13:02.342
but that's been known
for decades not to be true.


235
00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:05.345
But there are those
who call dams "methane bombs,"


236
00:13:05.377 --> 00:13:07.246
because they
release so much methane.


237
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.951
One of the reasons they produce methane
is that, when the reservoir first rises,


238
00:13:10.983 --> 00:13:14.086
it will, of course,
inundate the land above.


239
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.490
And when the forest
has been inundated,


240
00:13:16.522 --> 00:13:19.825
it then decays
in anaerobic conditions


241
00:13:19.858 --> 00:13:21.862
and produces methane.

242
00:13:21.895 --> 00:13:24.798
It is almost a prototypical
Bright Green lie,


243
00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.733
in that they claim
it is good for the environment,


244
00:13:27.766 --> 00:13:29.835
when actually it is harmful
for the environment,


245
00:13:29.868 --> 00:13:33.272
and it is harmful for
even global warming purposes.


246
00:13:33.305 --> 00:13:35.574
It succeeds on no level.

247
00:13:41.213 --> 00:13:44.450
One of the pioneering
writers in this field


248
00:13:44.483 --> 00:13:48.054
is a guy named Ozzie Zehner,
who wrote a book called <i>Green Illusions.</i>


249
00:13:48.087 --> 00:13:50.723
And he starts off the book
with a story,


250
00:13:50.756 --> 00:13:53.959
from when he was working,
doing solar installations.


251
00:13:53.992 --> 00:13:57.196
And he was in Washington, D.C.
and these politicians


252
00:13:57.229 --> 00:13:59.465
wanted to install solar panels
on their roof.


253
00:13:59.498 --> 00:14:02.234
So, he went to their house
to check out the site and...


254
00:14:02.267 --> 00:14:06.338
and see what it would look like, so he
could give them a... you know, a quote.


255
00:14:06.371 --> 00:14:09.476
And he got there
and assessed the situation


256
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:11.978
and he went back
and talked to them and he said,


257
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:14.847
"Look, you've got these
beautiful old oak trees


258
00:14:14.881 --> 00:14:17.150
growing on the south side
of your house,


259
00:14:17.183 --> 00:14:19.718
and if you want to put in
solar panels on your roof,


260
00:14:19.751 --> 00:14:21.787
we're going to have to
cut these trees down.


261
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.492
And I would actually recommend that
you don't install the solar panels,


262
00:14:25.525 --> 00:14:29.326
because both in terms
of greenhouse gas emissions,


263
00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:31.564
and, uh, your electricity bill,

264
00:14:31.597 --> 00:14:34.668
these trees are providing
a greater benefit


265
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.036
by shading your house
in the summer,


266
00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:40.105
by protecting it
from winds in the winter, uh,


267
00:14:40.139 --> 00:14:42.075
than the solar panels would."

268
00:14:42.107 --> 00:14:45.178
And the people said,
"We don't care about that.


269
00:14:45.211 --> 00:14:46.947
We actually want you to
go ahead and cut them down


270
00:14:46.979 --> 00:14:49.415
and install the sol...
solar panels anyway."


271
00:14:49.448 --> 00:14:52.852
And I think that really
gets to the fundamental issue


272
00:14:52.885 --> 00:14:55.322
with these technologies is that,
for many people,


273
00:14:55.354 --> 00:14:57.590
they're more about
a status symbol


274
00:14:57.623 --> 00:14:59.792
and an indication of a...

275
00:14:59.825 --> 00:15:02.094
Some sort of
greener than thou...


276
00:15:02.127 --> 00:15:04.897
uh, mindset that's going on,

277
00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.633
than they are
an actual solution.


278
00:15:07.666 --> 00:15:11.204
If you can install
a solar panel on your roof...


279
00:15:12.038 --> 00:15:16.509
you may not
directly be seeing any smoke


280
00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:18.444
come out of any smokestacks...

281
00:15:19.145 --> 00:15:21.347
but that doesn't
mean it's not happening.


282
00:15:21.381 --> 00:15:25.385
You can't produce
a solar/wind infrastructure


283
00:15:25.418 --> 00:15:26.953
without fossil fuels.

284
00:15:26.986 --> 00:15:29.088
To produce solar
panels, you need...


285
00:15:29.121 --> 00:15:31.757
extremely high-purity silicon.

286
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:35.527
It's something
like 99.999% pure.


287
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.396
And that's not found in nature.

288
00:15:37.429 --> 00:15:40.165
But what you have to do is,
you have to go find


289
00:15:40.198 --> 00:15:42.335
the purest silicon deposits
that you can.


290
00:15:43.102 --> 00:15:46.372
And this is usually
in the form of sand mining,


291
00:15:46.405 --> 00:15:48.574
and this happens
around the world,


292
00:15:48.607 --> 00:15:50.276
and it's highly,
highly destructive.


293
00:15:50.977 --> 00:15:53.780
Because of the
demand for high-quality silica,


294
00:15:53.813 --> 00:15:57.417
there are islands off the coast of
China that have disappeared completely.


295
00:15:57.449 --> 00:15:59.619
They have mined the island
out of existence.


296
00:16:01.054 --> 00:16:04.723
They require rare earths and
much of the rare earth minerals


297
00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:07.193
come from Baotou in China.

298
00:16:07.226 --> 00:16:11.965
And Baotou is, essentially,
devoid of wildlife,


299
00:16:11.997 --> 00:16:17.536
and there is a, basically,

300
00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:19.672
tailings lake,
in which nothing can grow.


301
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.242
So, don't tell me
this has no effects.


302
00:16:22.275 --> 00:16:24.077
Don't tell me this is
environmentally neutral.

306
00:16:40.093 --> 00:16:44.064

333
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:17.090
You know,
why don't we imitate a forest


334
00:18:17.122 --> 00:18:19.124
and try to do
what the forest does?


335
00:18:19.158 --> 00:18:22.262
Take this clean, free energy

336
00:18:22.295 --> 00:18:24.096
and... and use it.

337
00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.733
And, um, that, to me,
is the opportunity.


338
00:18:26.766 --> 00:18:30.570
I think that every bit of our
clothing should be a solar panel.


339
00:18:30.602 --> 00:18:34.006
Uh, you know, I... I've got a backpack
that's got a solar panel on it,


340
00:18:34.039 --> 00:18:36.975
and I can charge my laptop
and my cell phone,


341
00:18:37.008 --> 00:18:38.911
right from the, uh...

342
00:18:38.945 --> 00:18:40.947
My... my, uh, backpack.

343
00:18:40.979 --> 00:18:45.050
I think that hats
and everything...


344
00:18:45.083 --> 00:18:47.853
You know, um, in France now,

345
00:18:47.887 --> 00:18:50.590
they're building

346
00:18:50.622 --> 00:18:52.958
and the highway
is a solar panel.


347
00:18:52.991 --> 00:18:55.494
And that highway,

348
00:18:55.527 --> 00:18:58.997
will service I don't know
how many 100,000 homes.


349
00:18:59.031 --> 00:19:01.868
And, um, the same thing
with concrete sidewalks.


350
00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.103
It should... our buildings should
be wrapped in solar panels,


351
00:19:05.137 --> 00:19:07.740
not just have them
up on the roofs,


352
00:19:07.773 --> 00:19:10.275
but everywhere
that sunlight hits,


353
00:19:10.308 --> 00:19:13.412
let's grab that and use it
the way that a forest does.


354
00:19:15.814 --> 00:19:18.584
<i>It's hard for me
to see many similarities</i>


355
00:19:18.618 --> 00:19:22.756
<i>between forests and solar
energy generation facilities.</i>


356
00:19:24.156 --> 00:19:27.961
<i>We all know solar panels
don't grow out of the ground.</i>


357
00:19:27.994 --> 00:19:30.496
<i>They require
a global supply chain</i>


358
00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:33.065
<i>and a functioning
industrial economy.</i>


359
00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:36.769
<i>With all the mining,
shipping, manufacturing</i>


360
00:19:36.802 --> 00:19:40.607
<i>and environmental harms
inherent to these processes.</i>


361
00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:45.612
<i>While forests sequester carbon,
provide habitat,</i>


362
00:19:45.644 --> 00:19:47.146
<i>and promote biodiversity.</i>

363
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.350
<i>Solar electric
generating facilities</i>


364
00:19:50.382 --> 00:19:52.751
<i>require habitat destruction,</i>

365
00:19:52.785 --> 00:19:55.153
<i>both at the site
where they are installed,</i>


366
00:19:55.187 --> 00:19:59.025
<i>and around the world, where the
materials to make them are extracted.</i>


367
00:20:00.993 --> 00:20:02.662
<i>While editing this film,</i>

368
00:20:02.695 --> 00:20:05.232
<i>I researched
the solar highway in France.</i>


369
00:20:06.098 --> 00:20:10.069
<i>Turns out it broke,
shortly after it was installed.</i>


370
00:20:10.102 --> 00:20:13.806
<i>One publication described
it as a "total disaster."</i>


371
00:20:16.208 --> 00:20:19.679
Solar and wind have been called
alternative fossil fuels,


372
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:21.413
because they require
fossil fuels


373
00:20:21.447 --> 00:20:23.882
at every stage
of the production process.


374
00:20:23.916 --> 00:20:27.186
So the mining, the shipping,
the manufacturing...


375
00:20:27.218 --> 00:20:29.322
- Yeah.
- ...it might be less than fossil fuels,


376
00:20:29.354 --> 00:20:31.591
but it still
adds up to quite a bit.


377
00:20:31.623 --> 00:20:33.726
You don't get
anything for nothing.


378
00:20:33.758 --> 00:20:39.998
Yeah, you know, to lay the asphalt,
uh, highway that France is,


379
00:20:40.032 --> 00:20:42.735
- you use a lot of fossil fuels.
- Yeah.


380
00:20:42.767 --> 00:20:46.538
Um, and that's the, uh,
the dilemma we're in.


381
00:20:46.572 --> 00:20:51.010
It seems to me that we have to
get off the... the deliberate...


382
00:20:51.043 --> 00:20:54.746
burning of fossil fuels that can
be replaced with electricity,


383
00:20:54.779 --> 00:21:00.052
and, uh, we have to minimize
the, uh, the c...


384
00:21:00.085 --> 00:21:02.921
the carbon that we use
in creating the products


385
00:21:02.955 --> 00:21:04.624
that are really going
to give us a big edge.


386
00:21:04.657 --> 00:21:07.360
But you don't get anything
for nothing.


387
00:21:07.392 --> 00:21:09.227
And there's no question,
you know,


388
00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.664
you think of all the metals
that go into a windmill.


389
00:21:12.698 --> 00:21:16.569
Even the servicing is going
to take, uh, fossil fuels


390
00:21:16.602 --> 00:21:18.737
to... to get up there and...

391
00:21:18.771 --> 00:21:21.874
Yeah, th...
but it's a question of...


392
00:21:21.907 --> 00:21:23.476
are they in the long term,

393
00:21:23.508 --> 00:21:27.512
are they going to
reduce our carbon footprint...


394
00:21:27.545 --> 00:21:29.082
in... in a long term way?

395
00:21:30.048 --> 00:21:31.917
<i>That's the real question.</i>

396
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:34.152
<i>Do solar panels
and wind turbines</i>


397
00:21:34.186 --> 00:21:37.857
<i>actually reduce carbon
emissions in the long term?</i>


398
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:43.327
<i>There's an assumption that when you add
energy from solar or wind to the grid,</i>


399
00:21:43.329 --> 00:21:45.832
<i>it displaces fossil fuels.</i>

400
00:21:45.864 --> 00:21:48.701
<i>But this isn't what
we're seeing in the real world.</i>


401
00:21:49.435 --> 00:21:52.005
This is really one of the key...

402
00:21:52.772 --> 00:21:55.475
elements in
the Bright Green vision.


403
00:21:55.507 --> 00:21:59.578
Is this idea that, as you bring
more and more green energy online,


404
00:21:59.612 --> 00:22:02.114
you turn off more fossil fuels.

405
00:22:02.148 --> 00:22:04.884
You don't need them anymore,
so you can get rid of them.


406
00:22:04.917 --> 00:22:06.852
And that's just not happening.

407
00:22:06.885 --> 00:22:08.620
If you actually
look at the data,


408
00:22:08.653 --> 00:22:11.223
the increase
in renewable energy,


409
00:22:11.256 --> 00:22:13.226
that power
is generally added on top


410
00:22:13.258 --> 00:22:15.594
of what's already available
from coal power plants,


411
00:22:15.628 --> 00:22:17.964
from fossil fuel power plants,

412
00:22:17.996 --> 00:22:20.199
from nuclear,
from hydro and so on.


413
00:22:21.801 --> 00:22:25.138
Research I've done,
looking at data on many nations,


414
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.641
over time, mostly over
the past five decades or so...


415
00:22:28.673 --> 00:22:33.045
um, shows that there's not
a strong rate of suppression,


416
00:22:33.079 --> 00:22:35.281
when you add
non-fossil fuel energy


417
00:22:35.314 --> 00:22:36.948
of suppressing fossil fuel use.

418
00:22:36.981 --> 00:22:41.353
It takes maybe
four to ten times more, um,


419
00:22:41.387 --> 00:22:45.925
non-fossil fuel energy, to get one
unit reduction in fossil energy,


420
00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:47.560
controlling for
what you'd expect


421
00:22:47.593 --> 00:22:50.462
from growth of population,
GDP and so forth.


422
00:22:50.496 --> 00:22:54.766
If you look at the trends
in all energy sources,


423
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.670
roughly speaking,
they've all grown rapidly.


424
00:22:57.702 --> 00:23:00.038
Fossil fuels,
when you add natural gas,


425
00:23:00.072 --> 00:23:03.242
you don't see any suppression,
per se of coal


426
00:23:03.275 --> 00:23:05.378
or oil consumption.

427
00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.280
Nuclear power doesn't seem to have
a strong effect on the others.


428
00:23:08.314 --> 00:23:10.248
Meaning, all energy sources
are consumed


429
00:23:10.282 --> 00:23:11.918
as their production increases.

430
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.353
And so I've called that, um,
the displacement paradox,


431
00:23:15.387 --> 00:23:18.091
just meaning, you know, we might
assume that one would displace another,


432
00:23:18.123 --> 00:23:19.891
it would push another
out in proportion,


433
00:23:19.925 --> 00:23:22.161
and we don't see that,
or we don't see it strongly.


434
00:23:22.193 --> 00:23:25.864
To the extent there is displacement,
it's certainly not one-for-one.


435
00:23:25.898 --> 00:23:28.434
But if you think about it,
most industries,


436
00:23:28.467 --> 00:23:30.969
companies, corporations,
they're trying to make profits.


437
00:23:31.003 --> 00:23:32.705
They're trying to expand
production and consumption.


438
00:23:32.737 --> 00:23:34.606
They're not trying
to conserve resources.


439
00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.775
So, that's historically,
new energy sources have just


440
00:23:36.808 --> 00:23:38.376
allowed for more growth, more...

441
00:23:38.410 --> 00:23:39.911
more production,
more consumption.


442
00:23:39.945 --> 00:23:41.714
If we want to
push out fossil fuels,


443
00:23:41.746 --> 00:23:43.349
I think we need to
push out fossil fuels,


444
00:23:43.381 --> 00:23:46.052
rather than just hoping
producing more


445
00:23:46.084 --> 00:23:49.554
wind or solar will do that,
naturally in the marketplace.


446
00:23:49.587 --> 00:23:51.757
While these energy
sources are being brought online,


447
00:23:51.791 --> 00:23:54.060
they tend to add on
top of the fossil fuels...

448
00:23:54.093 --> 00:23:56.394
- Yeah.
- ...they don't tend to displace them.


449
00:23:56.428 --> 00:23:59.966
So, it takes, on... on average,
about ten units of... of, like,


450
00:23:59.998 --> 00:24:04.469
solar or wind to displace
one unit of fossil fuel energy.


451
00:24:04.503 --> 00:24:07.741
- That's recently added to the grid...
- Yeah. Yeah.


452
00:24:09.307 --> 00:24:12.577
So, what is the conclusion
from an analysis like that?


453
00:24:12.611 --> 00:24:13.713
We shouldn't do anything?

454
00:24:15.014 --> 00:24:16.082
- No, I don't think so.
- Is it saying it's making it worse,


455
00:24:16.114 --> 00:24:18.016
by trying to
come up with a solution?


456
00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:20.253
No, it's... it's not.
It's not that.


457
00:24:20.285 --> 00:24:23.121
It's just maybe we're looking in
the wrong places for solutions.


458
00:24:23.154 --> 00:24:26.057
That maybe we need to tackle it
on a more systemic level.


459
00:24:26.091 --> 00:24:29.061
Yeah, there's... there's no question.

460
00:24:29.093 --> 00:24:33.099
I mean, our major impact
on the planet now,


461
00:24:33.131 --> 00:24:36.135
not just in terms of energy,
is consumption.


462
00:24:37.202 --> 00:24:40.506
And that was
a deliberate program.


463
00:24:40.538 --> 00:24:43.175
After all...
you're way too young,


464
00:24:43.208 --> 00:24:47.279
but, uh, I remember the impact
of the Great Depression.


465
00:24:47.313 --> 00:24:51.284
The 1930s. My mom and dad
were married in the 1930s,


466
00:24:51.316 --> 00:24:55.320
and that was a terrible time
and people learned to live


467
00:24:55.353 --> 00:24:57.957
and, you know,
cooperate and act together.


468
00:24:57.989 --> 00:25:02.127
In many ways, communities were much
stronger and tighter back then,


469
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:03.129
because you had to.

470
00:25:04.263 --> 00:25:06.732
What brought us out of
the Depression was World War II.


471
00:25:06.765 --> 00:25:09.669
Wars are great
for bringing economies up.


472
00:25:10.535 --> 00:25:13.872
As the war was coming to an end,
the Pr... U.S. President said,


473
00:25:13.906 --> 00:25:15.641
"Holy... we're
going to win this...


474
00:25:15.673 --> 00:25:18.143
but what do we do with
the economy in peacetime?"


475
00:25:19.044 --> 00:25:21.948
So, he asked his
Council of Economic Advisers...


476
00:25:22.648 --> 00:25:26.752
"How do you transition a wartime
economy to a peacetime economy?"


477
00:25:26.785 --> 00:25:29.154
And their answer
was "Consumption.


478
00:25:29.188 --> 00:25:33.292
You've got to make consumption
an American way of life."


479
00:25:33.324 --> 00:25:36.595
Buy things, use them up,
throw them away and buy more.


480
00:25:37.329 --> 00:25:39.999
And it works. 70% of
the North American economy,


481
00:25:40.032 --> 00:25:41.434
now is about consumption.

482
00:25:41.467 --> 00:25:45.438
So, we have a real pickle,
because the economy now


483
00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.441
has been so dedicated
to consumption.


484
00:25:49.475 --> 00:25:52.511
And we think that the economy
has got to be kept growing.


485
00:25:52.544 --> 00:25:56.748
Well, constant growth
is the creative cancer cells.


486
00:25:56.782 --> 00:25:58.885
Cancer cells think
they can grow forever.


487
00:26:03.855 --> 00:26:06.291
<i>What is the
energy being used for?</i>


488
00:26:06.324 --> 00:26:08.026
<i>Within this culture,</i>

489
00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:11.330
<i>production is the conversion
of the living to the dead.</i>


490
00:26:11.362 --> 00:26:14.499
<i>It's the conversion of
living forests to two-by-fours.</i>


491
00:26:14.533 --> 00:26:17.602
<i>A living forest is not counted.</i>

492
00:26:17.635 --> 00:26:20.439
<i>All these fish in the oceans,
they don't actually count.</i>


493
00:26:20.471 --> 00:26:22.340
<i>What happens is,
when the fish get killed</i>


494
00:26:22.373 --> 00:26:24.843
<i>and then
converted into fish sticks...</i>


495
00:26:24.877 --> 00:26:26.546
<i>then that adds to the GNP.</i>

496
00:26:27.845 --> 00:26:32.984
Alternative energies both
support and are produced by


497
00:26:33.017 --> 00:26:35.587
the industrial system
that's killing the planet.


498
00:26:35.621 --> 00:26:39.525
So, when people talk about

499
00:26:39.557 --> 00:26:42.361
to save the planet,
to save civilization,


500
00:26:42.393 --> 00:26:44.630
what they're actually
talking about is sustaining


501
00:26:44.662 --> 00:26:48.133
modern, high energy,
uh, ways of life,


502
00:26:48.167 --> 00:26:49.901
at the expense
of the natural world.


503
00:26:49.935 --> 00:26:53.306
I think we often have this,
uh, image that it's...


504
00:26:53.339 --> 00:26:56.042
wind power
and solar power companies


505
00:26:56.074 --> 00:26:59.111
competing with
fossil fuel power companies.


506
00:26:59.143 --> 00:27:02.180
And I think that... you know,
that varies on ownership,


507
00:27:02.214 --> 00:27:04.984
but a lot of times,
it's the same company


508
00:27:05.016 --> 00:27:07.920
that owns wind power
and fossil fuels.


509
00:27:07.952 --> 00:27:10.455
That's the nature
of economies, that...


510
00:27:10.488 --> 00:27:13.159
companies are involved in
these activities to make money.


511
00:27:13.191 --> 00:27:17.395
They're not trying to... to
displace or change other things.


512
00:27:17.429 --> 00:27:19.899
When a... a company
invests in wind power,


513
00:27:19.931 --> 00:27:22.434
it's typically
an economic decision,


514
00:27:22.468 --> 00:27:25.804
and that doesn't mean that they're
then trying to use less fossil fuel.


515
00:27:25.837 --> 00:27:30.308
And the irony is, a lot of times the
profits that come from renewable energy,


516
00:27:30.342 --> 00:27:32.311
can be invested
anywhere in the economy.


517
00:27:32.343 --> 00:27:34.846
That's another misunderstanding
about economies,


518
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.215
capitalist economies.

519
00:27:36.247 --> 00:27:37.816
If you make profits
from wind power,


520
00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:40.151
that doesn't mean those profits
are invested in wind power.


521
00:27:40.185 --> 00:27:43.089
They can be invested anywhere.
So, somewhere the irony is,


522
00:27:43.121 --> 00:27:46.726
those profits can also be invested
in expanding fossil fuel extraction.


523
00:27:50.795 --> 00:27:54.299
I lived for a number
of years in Salt Lake City,


524
00:27:54.333 --> 00:27:56.334
and the largest
copper mine in the world


525
00:27:56.368 --> 00:27:58.304
was about ten miles
from my house.


526
00:27:59.004 --> 00:28:02.808
And, uh, that mine is called
the Bingham Canyon Mine,


527
00:28:02.841 --> 00:28:04.709
it's been operating
for 100 years.


528
00:28:04.743 --> 00:28:08.246
And it's a mountaintop
removal mine.


529
00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:12.450
It's one of the largest
man-made holes on the planet.


530
00:28:12.484 --> 00:28:14.853
Copper production
is absolutely essential


531
00:28:14.887 --> 00:28:16.489
for green technologies.

532
00:28:16.522 --> 00:28:18.791
A single
wind turbine generator...


533
00:28:18.823 --> 00:28:23.996
maybe a five megawatt design, probably has
something like 1000lbs of copper in it.


534
00:28:24.028 --> 00:28:26.531
So, people like Mark Jacobson,

535
00:28:26.564 --> 00:28:29.369
who are calling for

536
00:28:30.235 --> 00:28:32.737
He's calling for 3.8 million

537
00:28:32.771 --> 00:28:35.307
five megawatt turbines
to be built.


538
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:39.345
Now, multiply that by

539
00:28:39.378 --> 00:28:41.213
and you've got a lot of copper.
I think it would be about


540
00:28:41.246 --> 00:28:44.249
six years of
the full production from...


541
00:28:44.283 --> 00:28:46.017
the Bingham Canyon mine,
which again,


542
00:28:46.051 --> 00:28:48.020
is the largest copper mine
in the world.


543
00:28:48.053 --> 00:28:52.024
So, when people say that wind turbines
are clean and green and sustainable,


544
00:28:52.056 --> 00:28:55.627
I think it's completely
out of touch with reality.


545
00:29:18.382 --> 00:29:21.687
Um, well,
my goals are to develop


546
00:29:21.719 --> 00:29:24.823
clean and renewable energy
solutions to global warming,


547
00:29:24.856 --> 00:29:27.392
air pollution
and energy and security.


548
00:29:27.426 --> 00:29:32.398
So, I do this by going state-by-state
in the U.S. and country-by-country,


549
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.333
and developing clean
and renewable energy plans,


550
00:29:35.366 --> 00:29:39.571
uh, that result... that require
electrifying all energy sectors,


551
00:29:39.604 --> 00:29:41.973
including electricity,
which is already electrified,


552
00:29:42.006 --> 00:29:43.775
transportation,
heating and cooling,


553
00:29:43.808 --> 00:29:46.612
industry, agriculture,
forestry and fishing.


554
00:29:46.644 --> 00:29:49.547
And then providing that
electricity with 100% clean,


555
00:29:49.581 --> 00:29:52.184
renewable wind,
water and solar power...


556
00:29:52.217 --> 00:29:55.454
and... and also
involving storage,


557
00:29:55.487 --> 00:29:59.425
and, uh, some additional
transmission as well.


558
00:30:00.292 --> 00:30:03.062
What percentage
of the electricity


559
00:30:03.094 --> 00:30:05.396
would be from what?
Like solar, wind,


560
00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:08.066
or... like, what percentages
would they take that?


561
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:11.570
Well, in a 100% clean renewable
energy economy worldwide,


562
00:30:11.602 --> 00:30:12.971
we'd probably have around...

563
00:30:13.906 --> 00:30:18.711
55% solar, maybe 40% wind...

564
00:30:18.744 --> 00:30:20.446
And, uh,

565
00:30:20.478 --> 00:30:23.048
you know, the rest of it is I...

566
00:30:23.881 --> 00:30:25.417
You know, it's going to be
everything else, like,


567
00:30:25.449 --> 00:30:28.353
hydroelectric, geothermal,
tidal wave power


568
00:30:28.387 --> 00:30:29.489
in small quantities...

569
00:30:30.288 --> 00:30:31.723
so...

570
00:30:31.756 --> 00:30:34.426
Yeah, so it's going to be...

571
00:30:34.458 --> 00:30:35.894
you know, mostly solar and wind.

572
00:30:40.465 --> 00:30:44.336
Wind energy, of course is
produced by these giant turbines


573
00:30:44.369 --> 00:30:47.173
that they erect in the windiest
places they can find.


574
00:30:47.206 --> 00:30:49.408
And they've been
doing it for a long time now.


575
00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.844
One of the first
production-scale wind facilities


576
00:30:52.878 --> 00:30:55.948
was down in California,
near the Bay Area.


577
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.218
And they... they called that particular
place, "The Cuisinart for Birds,"


578
00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.352
because it killed so many birds.

579
00:31:01.385 --> 00:31:04.022
And that's
one of the first problems


580
00:31:04.055 --> 00:31:05.958
that these wind turbines cause,

581
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:09.360
is they kill a lot of birds,
and they kill a lot of bats.


582
00:31:09.393 --> 00:31:12.297
What happens with bats is that,

583
00:31:12.331 --> 00:31:13.966
they'll be flying near
the blades,


584
00:31:13.998 --> 00:31:16.535
and as the blades move,
they're creating such a massive


585
00:31:16.567 --> 00:31:19.671
pressure differential
between the front of the blade


586
00:31:19.705 --> 00:31:21.774
and the back of the blade,
that, um...


587
00:31:22.608 --> 00:31:24.977
that their lungs will explode.

588
00:31:25.009 --> 00:31:27.011
And it's called barotrauma.

589
00:31:27.045 --> 00:31:30.115
It's a pressure injury,
essentially and, um...


590
00:31:30.948 --> 00:31:32.852
I'm sure a pretty horrible
way to die.


591
00:31:34.218 --> 00:31:35.254
And...

592
00:31:36.388 --> 00:31:39.558
So, the impacts
on bats and birds alone,


593
00:31:39.591 --> 00:31:43.329
are reason enough
to never support wind energy.


594
00:31:46.064 --> 00:31:50.768
If you talk to these
mainstream so-called "environmentalists"


595
00:31:50.802 --> 00:31:53.371
about the bird deaths
from windmills,


596
00:31:53.404 --> 00:31:55.240
or the bat deaths
from windmills,


597
00:31:55.274 --> 00:31:57.977
they will oftentimes say, "Well,

598
00:31:58.009 --> 00:32:00.011
there's a lot more birds
die from cats,


599
00:32:00.045 --> 00:32:02.814
or a lot more
birds die from skyscrapers,"


600
00:32:02.848 --> 00:32:04.216
as though that makes it okay.

601
00:32:04.248 --> 00:32:06.418
Buildings kill
one billion birds per year,


602
00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.754
and cats kill about
three billion birds per year.


603
00:32:08.786 --> 00:32:12.123
So, it's really a red herring
to talk about birds'...


604
00:32:12.157 --> 00:32:13.891
bit... death
due to wind turbines.


605
00:32:13.925 --> 00:32:17.129
And I think about this
in terms of a medical model,


606
00:32:17.161 --> 00:32:20.966
that if you have someone
in a hospital who has,


607
00:32:20.998 --> 00:32:23.168
for example,
AIDS and they have...


608
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.072
seven different opportunistic
infections are going after them,


609
00:32:27.104 --> 00:32:28.940
You don't say, "Well...

610
00:32:28.974 --> 00:32:31.210
it doesn't matter if we add
MRSA to the mix, does it?"


611
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.946
Just because there's one
bad thing can happen to you,


612
00:32:33.978 --> 00:32:36.148
doesn't mean you don't
prevent the second bad thing.


613
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:38.650
That's the same with all these
wind energy facilities,


614
00:32:38.683 --> 00:32:43.154
that just because there are birds
who die flying into skyscrapers,


615
00:32:43.188 --> 00:32:45.457
doesn't mean you should kill

616
00:32:45.489 --> 00:32:48.059
with wind energy generators.
It makes no sense!


617
00:32:48.093 --> 00:32:50.629
You would think... here's
the thing is, if there were


618
00:32:50.661 --> 00:32:52.497
no other threats to them,

619
00:32:52.531 --> 00:32:54.066
then maybe you could
consider this,


620
00:32:54.099 --> 00:32:56.602
except still, for those

621
00:32:56.634 --> 00:32:59.871
but when the bird populations
are collapsing anyway,


622
00:32:59.904 --> 00:33:01.840
you're adding another threat.
Are you nuts?


623
00:33:04.042 --> 00:33:05.177
This is horrible.

624
00:33:06.344 --> 00:33:09.648
So what would be
the impact on birds and bats


625
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.852
if we had 40% wind energy?

626
00:33:13.985 --> 00:33:16.588
Yeah, we would reduce
bird and bat deaths


627
00:33:16.621 --> 00:33:18.756
by about a factor of ten,

628
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:21.359
compared to what they are
from fossil fuels.


629
00:33:21.392 --> 00:33:23.895
So in other words, fossil...

630
00:33:23.929 --> 00:33:25.496
You know,
wind turbines kill birds.


631
00:33:25.529 --> 00:33:28.666
The American Bird Conservancy
estimates in the United States


632
00:33:28.699 --> 00:33:32.371
about 400,000 to 500,000 birds
per year and were killed.


633
00:33:32.403 --> 00:33:36.842
But we also know that oil,
coal and gas, for example,


634
00:33:36.874 --> 00:33:39.644
they kill birds at a rate
that is ten times higher,


635
00:33:39.678 --> 00:33:41.814
per unit of energy,
than wind power does,


636
00:33:41.846 --> 00:33:46.250
due to not only destroying
their habitats, uh, and...


637
00:33:46.284 --> 00:33:49.354
...by all
the mining that goes on.


638
00:33:49.388 --> 00:33:51.090
One of the first rules
of propaganda is


639
00:33:51.122 --> 00:33:53.726
if you can slide your premises
by people, you've got them.


640
00:33:53.758 --> 00:33:57.063
And so, if you can...

641
00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.934
frame a question as, "Well...

642
00:34:02.933 --> 00:34:06.204
look, lots of birds are going
to die from global warming.


643
00:34:06.237 --> 00:34:08.639
So instead, what if we only have

644
00:34:08.673 --> 00:34:12.144
200 million birds a year
die from windmills.


645
00:34:12.177 --> 00:34:13.179
Isn't that better?"

646
00:34:15.447 --> 00:34:20.218
Okay, what is inherent in
that question is the notion


647
00:34:20.251 --> 00:34:22.954
that the world
needs industrial energy,


648
00:34:22.988 --> 00:34:23.889
and that...

649
00:34:25.055 --> 00:34:31.863
the choice is between
burning oil and gas and coal,


650
00:34:31.896 --> 00:34:34.999
and having wind turbines.

651
00:34:35.032 --> 00:34:38.569
But that's not the choice,
for multiple reasons.


652
00:34:38.602 --> 00:34:40.572
One reason
that's not the choice...


653
00:34:41.273 --> 00:34:42.240
is because...

654
00:34:43.541 --> 00:34:47.545
there is nothing inevitable
about industrial production.


655
00:34:47.579 --> 00:34:49.314
It is a social choice,

656
00:34:49.347 --> 00:34:52.316
and given that the planet is being
killed because of those choices,


657
00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:54.085
you would think
we would make different choices.


658
00:34:54.119 --> 00:34:56.255
Do you think it
would be better for, like,


659
00:34:56.287 --> 00:35:00.291
the natural world
if we just didn't use energy?


660
00:35:00.325 --> 00:35:04.229
Well, I suppose that would
be nice, but, um...


661
00:35:04.262 --> 00:35:06.832
- Yeah, it's not a very practical thing...
- Yeah.


662
00:35:06.865 --> 00:35:09.001
...but it's, uh, it's...
definitely it would be nice


663
00:35:09.034 --> 00:35:10.936
if we didn't use energy,
but then how would we...


664
00:35:12.037 --> 00:35:14.305
You know,
we would not be able to survive.


665
00:35:15.039 --> 00:35:17.543
<i>Gosh,
I wonder how humans survived</i>


666
00:35:17.575 --> 00:35:21.813
<i>for the past 200,000
years without electricity?</i>


667
00:35:21.847 --> 00:35:24.816
<i>Could it be that we don't
actually need electricity</i>


668
00:35:24.849 --> 00:35:25.950
<i>for our survival?</i>

669
00:35:27.184 --> 00:35:29.755
Electricity is a convenience.
It is a luxury.


670
00:35:29.787 --> 00:35:33.592
Humans have survived for
tens of thousands of years...


671
00:35:34.559 --> 00:35:36.095
without industrial electricity.

672
00:35:36.894 --> 00:35:38.863
And there's a real question...

673
00:35:38.896 --> 00:35:41.032
as to whether
humans will survive,


674
00:35:41.066 --> 00:35:43.669
with industrial electricity.

675
00:35:43.702 --> 00:35:47.606
What is energy used for when
it's produced in this society?


676
00:35:47.639 --> 00:35:49.173
It's used for the military.

677
00:35:49.206 --> 00:35:52.310
It's used for
producing cheap consumer goods.


678
00:35:52.343 --> 00:35:54.179
It's used for entertainment.

679
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:56.948
It's used for transportation.

680
00:35:56.981 --> 00:36:00.686
It's mostly used for
these non-essential luxuries


681
00:36:00.718 --> 00:36:03.222
that are destroying the planet,
in one way or another.


682
00:36:09.994 --> 00:36:11.229
<i>This is Ivanpah.</i>

683
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.700
<i>It's a concentrated
solar power system,</i>


684
00:36:14.733 --> 00:36:17.068
<i>located in
southeastern California.</i>


685
00:36:18.035 --> 00:36:22.039
<i>A field of mirrors concentrate
sunlight on a central tower,</i>


686
00:36:22.072 --> 00:36:25.510
<i>heating a fluid inside to
over 1000 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>


687
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:29.113
<i>The light from the mirrors
attracts insects,</i>


688
00:36:29.146 --> 00:36:31.682
<i>and the insects attract birds.</i>

689
00:36:31.715 --> 00:36:34.352
<i>The concentrated sunlight
burns every creature</i>


690
00:36:34.385 --> 00:36:35.621
<i>who flies overhead.</i>

691
00:36:37.354 --> 00:36:39.023
Before you can
commit any mass atrocity,


692
00:36:39.057 --> 00:36:41.526
you have to have
what Robert Jay Lifton calls,


693
00:36:41.559 --> 00:36:43.094
"A claim to virtue."

694
00:36:43.128 --> 00:36:44.729
And what he means by that,
is that...


695
00:36:45.764 --> 00:36:50.202
no one ever admits
to causing an atrocity.


696
00:36:50.235 --> 00:36:54.006
That internally, you have to make
yourself out to be the good person.


697
00:36:54.039 --> 00:36:56.208
And so,
from their own perspective,


698
00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.878
the Nazis weren't committing
mass murder and genocide,


699
00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.780
they were
purifying the Aryan race.


700
00:37:02.813 --> 00:37:05.049
And today capitalists
are not killing the planet,


701
00:37:05.083 --> 00:37:05.918
they are...

702
00:37:06.784 --> 00:37:08.420
developing natural resources.

703
00:37:08.452 --> 00:37:10.354
And how this relates
to the Bright Greens,


704
00:37:10.387 --> 00:37:13.291
is the Bright Greens are not
in fact killing the planet,


705
00:37:13.325 --> 00:37:16.028
but they are saving the planet.

706
00:37:16.061 --> 00:37:18.997
Unfortunately, they might have to
kill part of the desert to do it,


707
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.600
and so,
you can see headlines like,


708
00:37:21.633 --> 00:37:24.136
"Harming the desert
to save the world."


709
00:37:24.168 --> 00:37:27.772
That was before they put in this
solar power generation facility,


710
00:37:27.805 --> 00:37:29.641
that caused great harm to birds,

711
00:37:29.673 --> 00:37:32.276
caused great harm
to desert tortoises.


712
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:33.978
Great harm to the landscape.

713
00:37:34.012 --> 00:37:36.180
It's all a claim to virtue.

714
00:37:36.213 --> 00:37:38.516
The planet itself does not need

715
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.785
solar power
generation facilities.


716
00:37:41.686 --> 00:37:42.888
The planet needs...

717
00:37:44.055 --> 00:37:46.225
to have this stopped.

718
00:37:48.293 --> 00:37:50.429
There are some estimates that

719
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:54.099
solar energy
generation facilities,


720
00:37:54.131 --> 00:37:57.635
by 2050, they could be
the greatest threat to habitat.


721
00:37:57.668 --> 00:37:59.170
So, that's how many
they want to put in.


722
00:38:01.238 --> 00:38:03.507
It's extraordinary what you can
get by if you've...


723
00:38:03.541 --> 00:38:05.577
got a claim to virtue,
as we saw with the Holocaust,


724
00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:07.579
as we're seeing with
the murder of the planet.


725
00:38:07.612 --> 00:38:10.247
I've seen environmentalists,
sort of mainstream,


726
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:13.651
Bright Green environmentalists,
applauding the construction


727
00:38:13.684 --> 00:38:17.389
of gigantic
battery factories in Nevada,


728
00:38:17.421 --> 00:38:20.992
simply because they're
for electric automobiles.


729
00:38:21.026 --> 00:38:22.361
And that's nuts.

730
00:38:22.394 --> 00:38:24.296
Environmentalists in general...

731
00:38:25.963 --> 00:38:30.802
have... have historically been pretty
decent on being opposed to electronics...


732
00:38:31.535 --> 00:38:33.438
and environmentalists,
historically have been


733
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:35.139
pretty strong
in being opposed...


734
00:38:36.106 --> 00:38:37.342
to automobiles.

735
00:38:38.142 --> 00:38:39.677
But somehow,

736
00:38:39.711 --> 00:38:42.747
if you combine
electronics and automobiles,


737
00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.349
then suddenly it's a good idea.

738
00:38:45.316 --> 00:38:46.619
That's crazy.

739
00:38:47.985 --> 00:38:51.255
Never mind the fact,
that most of the pollution


740
00:38:51.289 --> 00:38:53.825
coming from an automobile does
not emerge from the tailpipe,


741
00:38:53.858 --> 00:38:55.760
it's in
the construction vehicle.


742
00:38:55.793 --> 00:38:57.929
And never mind the fact that

743
00:38:57.961 --> 00:39:04.035
there are about 228 trillion
insects killed per year by cars.


744
00:39:04.068 --> 00:39:05.137
There are about...

745
00:39:06.338 --> 00:39:09.508
two billion vertebrate animals
killed every year by cars,


746
00:39:09.541 --> 00:39:11.876
and I don't care whether
they're electric cars or...


747
00:39:11.909 --> 00:39:14.779
diesel or gasoline engine,
doesn't matter.


748
00:39:14.813 --> 00:39:16.814
And that's only those
who were killed directly.


749
00:39:16.847 --> 00:39:19.083
Roads fragment habitat.

750
00:39:19.117 --> 00:39:21.420
Punching in roads
into new areas,


751
00:39:21.452 --> 00:39:24.322
make it so loggers can follow,
miners can follow...


752
00:39:25.155 --> 00:39:27.391
all sorts
of destruction follows.


753
00:39:27.425 --> 00:39:30.762
And somehow, if it's an electric
vehicle, it's supposed to be okay.


754
00:39:30.795 --> 00:39:33.764
Of course, electric cars, like a
lot of the other green technologies,


755
00:39:33.798 --> 00:39:35.534
are getting huge subsidies.

756
00:39:35.566 --> 00:39:37.501
There are these tax credits.

757
00:39:37.534 --> 00:39:40.805
There are write offs,
there are government rebates.


758
00:39:40.838 --> 00:39:43.574
And this is a public subsidy,

759
00:39:43.608 --> 00:39:46.010
coming directly
from our tax dollars


760
00:39:46.043 --> 00:39:48.179
and going to corporations.

761
00:39:48.213 --> 00:39:51.083
And it's incentivizing them
to build more cars,


762
00:39:51.115 --> 00:39:53.552
to build more factories,
to build more parking lots,


763
00:39:53.584 --> 00:39:57.521
to build more shopping malls, to build
more highways, to build more roads.


764
00:39:57.555 --> 00:39:59.725
To invest in car culture,
as a whole.


765
00:39:59.758 --> 00:40:00.892
There was a
headline the other day


766
00:40:00.925 --> 00:40:03.028
that was pretty funny.
It was about how...


767
00:40:03.061 --> 00:40:05.329
by putting all these
electric cars on the road,


768
00:40:05.363 --> 00:40:07.365
Tesla could reduce

769
00:40:07.398 --> 00:40:11.035
oil consumption in the United States
by about 300,000 barrels per day.


770
00:40:11.068 --> 00:40:14.905
It feels like a lot,
until you realize that in 2015,


771
00:40:14.938 --> 00:40:16.941
U.S. oil consumption
for transportation


772
00:40:16.974 --> 00:40:19.844
was about 20 million
barrels per day.


773
00:40:19.878 --> 00:40:24.583
So, this is a whopping

774
00:40:24.615 --> 00:40:29.086
at the cost of lithium mines
around the world.


775
00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:31.522
At the cost of all these
additional cars being made,


776
00:40:31.555 --> 00:40:33.057
that are going to actually cost,

777
00:40:33.758 --> 00:40:36.995
God knows how many
barrels per day to manufacture.


778
00:40:37.028 --> 00:40:38.363
I know that

779
00:40:38.396 --> 00:40:40.766
the Movement for the
Emancipation of the Niger Delta


780
00:40:40.798 --> 00:40:43.901
and other groups in Nigeria,
have reduced oil output...


781
00:40:44.836 --> 00:40:50.109
by up to 60%, um,
through acts of sabotage on...


782
00:40:51.342 --> 00:40:53.644
um, oil rigs there.

783
00:40:54.345 --> 00:40:55.247
And...

784
00:40:56.113 --> 00:40:59.016
they have done so
with really no time lag.


785
00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.754
It's... they reduce
the oil output in real time.


786
00:41:03.454 --> 00:41:04.990
Ask yourself, uh...

787
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:09.294
from the perspective
of nonhumans...


788
00:41:10.028 --> 00:41:11.730
or of poor humans...

789
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:17.369
or of any creature going to be
driven extinct by global warming


790
00:41:17.401 --> 00:41:18.903
or by roads or by cars...

791
00:41:19.671 --> 00:41:21.473
you know, which...
which would you prefer.


792
00:41:28.278 --> 00:41:31.883
<i>I started fighting
for the ocean six years ago.</i>


793
00:41:32.684 --> 00:41:36.088
<i>Since then, I've seen this
world continue to collapse.</i>


794
00:41:37.655 --> 00:41:41.392
<i>The ocean is the foundation
of life on this planet.</i>


795
00:41:41.425 --> 00:41:44.862
<i>The fact that we're losing it
at the rate we are is alarming.</i>


796
00:41:46.296 --> 00:41:48.465
<i>I think part of the reason
we're failing,</i>


797
00:41:48.499 --> 00:41:51.369
<i>is that we ask,
"What is politically possible?"</i>


798
00:41:51.401 --> 00:41:53.905
<i>More often than we ask,
"What is necessary?"</i>


799
00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:59.410
We're in the midst of
what's called the Anthropocene,


800
00:41:59.443 --> 00:42:02.680
which is the sixth major
extinction of life on this planet.


801
00:42:02.713 --> 00:42:06.450
The last one
was 65.2 million years ago,


802
00:42:06.483 --> 00:42:09.753
and the most serious one was,
uh, the Permian Extinction,


803
00:42:09.787 --> 00:42:13.091
250 million years ago,
which wiped out 97% of everything.


804
00:42:14.057 --> 00:42:18.128
The Anthropocene has the potential
to wipe out 90% of everything.


805
00:42:18.162 --> 00:42:19.865
It won't wipe out everything,

806
00:42:19.898 --> 00:42:23.602
but we will go along with that

807
00:42:23.635 --> 00:42:24.803
So, we won't survive.

808
00:42:26.304 --> 00:42:30.041
At the climate change conference
in Paris in 2015,


809
00:42:30.073 --> 00:42:31.876
I said, "Look, you know,
the only way to do this is


810
00:42:31.909 --> 00:42:34.311
we need a moratorium
on all industrialized,


811
00:42:34.345 --> 00:42:36.814
heavy gear fishing
for the next 50 years.


812
00:42:36.847 --> 00:42:39.650
That's the only thing that's going to
work, we have to shut it down.


813
00:42:39.684 --> 00:42:41.787
Right now, there's ten million
fishing vessels out there...


814
00:42:42.552 --> 00:42:45.389
44 million of them,

815
00:42:45.423 --> 00:42:48.126
And there's no such thing. There's no
such thing as a sustainable fishery.


816
00:42:48.159 --> 00:42:50.327
It doesn't exist anywhere.

817
00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.897
So, we have to shut it down,
if we care about the future.


818
00:42:57.601 --> 00:42:59.703
I don't think people realize,

819
00:42:59.737 --> 00:43:03.608
how intimate the connection
we have with ocean is.


820
00:43:03.641 --> 00:43:05.610
It's the very
foundation of life.


821
00:43:06.543 --> 00:43:10.848
People think that the oxygen comes
from the rainforest and trees,


822
00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:13.784
which is true,
but it's only about 28%.


823
00:43:13.818 --> 00:43:16.121
The rest of it
comes from the ocean.


824
00:43:16.153 --> 00:43:20.291
The photosynthesis that are
usually done by plants and trees,


825
00:43:20.325 --> 00:43:22.527
are actually
done by phytoplanktons,


826
00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:25.296
which are these
tiny microalgae organisms


827
00:43:25.329 --> 00:43:27.598
that are living in the ocean.

828
00:43:27.631 --> 00:43:31.302
It takes the carbon dioxide
and releases oxygen.


829
00:43:31.336 --> 00:43:35.740
So, it's very important for humans to
actually protect the phytoplankton.


830
00:43:35.773 --> 00:43:40.111
And that's where the population
of whales come into picture.


831
00:43:40.144 --> 00:43:44.149
Whale feces are very rich
in iron and other nutrients


832
00:43:44.182 --> 00:43:47.485
that are very important
for phytoplankton to be healthy,


833
00:43:47.517 --> 00:43:52.057
and whales are moving
from depth to the surface


834
00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:55.392
and provide nutrients
through all these layers.


835
00:43:55.425 --> 00:43:58.095
So, all that balance
in the ocean,


836
00:43:58.128 --> 00:44:00.397
every species
depends on another.


837
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:01.800
It's very important.

838
00:44:01.833 --> 00:44:04.269
We have to keep
all this balance together.


839
00:44:09.374 --> 00:44:12.077
Since 1950,
there's been a 40% diminishment


840
00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:14.479
in phytoplankton populations
around the world.


841
00:44:14.512 --> 00:44:18.450
And when you couple that with the fact
that we're destroying the world's forests,


842
00:44:18.483 --> 00:44:21.285
then really what we have is
that this planet has two lungs.


843
00:44:21.318 --> 00:44:23.087
One is blue and one is green,

844
00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:25.724
and we're destroying both
the green and the blue lungs.


845
00:44:25.756 --> 00:44:28.626
What would it take
to actually save the ocean?


846
00:44:28.659 --> 00:44:30.628
What would it take
to actually save the oceans?


847
00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:31.829
Well, shut down all

848
00:44:31.863 --> 00:44:34.332
heavy gear industrialized
fishing operations.


849
00:44:34.365 --> 00:44:36.368
Stop sonic testing in the ocean.

850
00:44:36.401 --> 00:44:38.737
Spracking military
sonic testing.


851
00:44:38.769 --> 00:44:40.704
Stop dumping chemical pollutions

852
00:44:40.738 --> 00:44:43.341
and radioactive materials
into the ocean.


853
00:44:43.374 --> 00:44:46.410
Uh... stop dump...
dumping agro, um...


854
00:44:47.144 --> 00:44:50.648
waste from both the, uh...
you know, the meat industry


855
00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.583
and also from
the production of vegetables,


856
00:44:52.617 --> 00:44:54.052
of pesticides
and everything like that.


857
00:44:54.084 --> 00:44:55.753
You know,
there's so many factors.


858
00:44:55.787 --> 00:44:56.788
Can we stop them?

859
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.288
You know, a few years ago,
I was at a...


860
00:44:58.322 --> 00:45:01.425
oh, man, quite a few years ago,
I was at a discussion in Toronto


861
00:45:01.459 --> 00:45:03.628
about pollution
in the Don River...


862
00:45:04.595 --> 00:45:06.031
and the Union people were there

863
00:45:06.063 --> 00:45:08.065
and the environmentalists
were there and, uh,


864
00:45:08.099 --> 00:45:10.168
everybody's saying,
"We've got to solve the problem.


865
00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:12.036
And how are we
going to solve the problem?"


866
00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:14.372
And I just, uh,
was very unpopular,


867
00:45:14.405 --> 00:45:16.807
because I said, "Do we know
what's causing the pollution?


868
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.744
Do we know what factories
are... are doing this?"


869
00:45:20.778 --> 00:45:21.880
"Well, yes, we do."

870
00:45:21.912 --> 00:45:23.481
"Well, stop doing it."

871
00:45:24.448 --> 00:45:26.383
And they all looked at me
like I'd just...


872
00:45:26.416 --> 00:45:30.121
said something completely outrageous
and blasphemous, you know.


873
00:45:30.153 --> 00:45:32.756
"Just stop doing it.
Just turn off the taps."


874
00:45:32.789 --> 00:45:34.224
But no, they wanted a solution,

875
00:45:34.258 --> 00:45:35.660
without really
getting a solution.


876
00:45:41.032 --> 00:45:43.133
I'm on my way to
the Green Living Show.


877
00:45:43.166 --> 00:45:46.603
Basically, it's an expo with
people selling eco products.


878
00:45:46.637 --> 00:45:48.206
You know,
it all centers around this idea


879
00:45:48.238 --> 00:45:51.108
that we can shop our way
to sustainability.


880
00:45:51.142 --> 00:45:53.977
And there's a great line
from <i>Endgame,</i> which is,


881
00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:57.181
"Within an industrial economy,
buying good things


882
00:45:57.215 --> 00:45:59.150
isn't really
doing good for the planet,


883
00:45:59.182 --> 00:46:01.452
so much as it is doing
something not quite so bad."


884
00:46:02.519 --> 00:46:05.689
I think this all really
serves as a distraction,


885
00:46:05.722 --> 00:46:08.559
you know, it points people's
attention towards themselves,


886
00:46:08.592 --> 00:46:10.661
and towards
their personal habits,


887
00:46:10.695 --> 00:46:12.130
so that they're not looking

888
00:46:12.162 --> 00:46:13.798
at the root causes
of these problems.


889
00:46:13.831 --> 00:46:15.867
They're not
looking at the systems


890
00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.170
that make this culture
functionally unsustainable.


891
00:46:19.202 --> 00:46:21.840
Instead, it's putting
the blame on individuals.


892
00:46:21.872 --> 00:46:24.476
And I'm not saying individuals
don't have responsibility.


893
00:46:24.508 --> 00:46:26.711
They do,
but our responsibility is not


894
00:46:26.744 --> 00:46:31.048
to find the most eco-ethical
toothbrush and buy it.


895
00:46:31.081 --> 00:46:34.017
Our responsibility
is to stand between industry


896
00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:36.453
and what's left
of life on this planet.


897
00:46:36.487 --> 00:46:39.456
Our responsibility is to deprive
those who would destroy life


898
00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:41.559
of their ability to do so.

899
00:46:41.592 --> 00:46:45.195
And shopping for green products
does not threaten those in power.


900
00:46:45.229 --> 00:46:48.833
It takes people's very real
concerns about the environment,


901
00:46:48.865 --> 00:46:51.969
and diverts that into
a way to promote consumerism.


902
00:46:54.639 --> 00:46:57.642
<i>The underpinnings of
these solutions are all about,</i>


903
00:46:57.675 --> 00:47:00.111
<i>you as an individual.
"What can you do?"</i>


904
00:47:00.144 --> 00:47:01.613
<i>And the answer is honestly,
it's like,</i>


905
00:47:01.646 --> 00:47:04.249
<i>don't be an individual,
because as an individual,</i>


906
00:47:04.282 --> 00:47:05.584
<i>you just don't have
that much power.</i>


907
00:47:06.316 --> 00:47:08.619
<i>The only power you have
as an individual is,</i>


908
00:47:08.653 --> 00:47:10.522
<i>"Well, I can buy this
instead of that,</i>


909
00:47:10.555 --> 00:47:12.690
<i>or I can try to recycle
a little bit better."</i>


910
00:47:12.722 --> 00:47:15.994
<i>That's not a lot of power,
given the global scale of destruction.</i>


911
00:47:17.961 --> 00:47:18.929
- Hey!
- How's it going?


912
00:47:18.963 --> 00:47:20.365
- Good, how are you?
- Good, good.


913
00:47:20.398 --> 00:47:21.798
So, is this an electric car?

914
00:47:21.831 --> 00:47:23.634
Yes, this is
a fully electric vehicle.


915
00:47:23.668 --> 00:47:25.602
Um, pretty much
from the whole charge,


916
00:47:25.635 --> 00:47:27.704
it goes up to 383 kilometers.

917
00:47:27.738 --> 00:47:30.175
Um... People love the color.

918
00:47:30.208 --> 00:47:31.843
- Yeah. It's very bright.
- It's very bright,


919
00:47:31.876 --> 00:47:33.444
- grabs your attention. Yeah, very green.
- Very green.


920
00:47:33.476 --> 00:47:35.145
- That's exactly what we wanted.
- Yeah...


921
00:47:35.179 --> 00:47:38.950
- That's great.
- How much energy does it take to make an electric car?


922
00:47:38.983 --> 00:47:40.351
Energy to make an electric car?

923
00:47:40.383 --> 00:47:43.220
Um, well,
the battery is 60 kilowatts.


924
00:47:43.253 --> 00:47:44.121
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...


925
00:47:45.689 --> 00:47:48.458
Uh, to make the car?
I wouldn't want to


926
00:47:48.492 --> 00:47:50.295
- give you false information, because I don't know.
- Okay.


927
00:47:54.532 --> 00:47:57.367
<i>"Vote with your dollars"
has become a catchphrase</i>


928
00:47:57.401 --> 00:47:59.237
<i>of mainstream environmentalism.</i>

929
00:48:00.537 --> 00:48:04.175
<i>The 1950s was the first time
that human beings</i>


930
00:48:04.208 --> 00:48:06.510
<i>were called "consumers,"
more often</i>


931
00:48:06.543 --> 00:48:08.045
<i>than they were
called "citizens."</i>


932
00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:12.350
<i>If you can convince people
that their primary means</i>


933
00:48:12.383 --> 00:48:14.785
<i>of social and political action</i>

934
00:48:14.818 --> 00:48:17.188
<i>is through
their personal consumption,</i>


935
00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:19.023
<i>then their choices of resistance</i>

936
00:48:19.055 --> 00:48:21.425
<i>are reduced to
buying or not buying.</i>


937
00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.195
<i>But human beings
have a much wider range</i>


938
00:48:25.229 --> 00:48:26.631
<i>of available tactics.</i>

939
00:48:28.099 --> 00:48:30.702
They want us to
believe that consumer choices


940
00:48:30.735 --> 00:48:32.771
are the only way
we can change things.


941
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.506
But if we accept that,
then that means they've won,


942
00:48:36.539 --> 00:48:39.177
because we're defining
ourselves as consumers.


943
00:48:40.278 --> 00:48:43.782
I don't think we should
let them have that victory.


944
00:48:44.648 --> 00:48:48.218
Because the reality is that,
yes, we consume things.


945
00:48:48.251 --> 00:48:52.090
I have to buy things within
this culture to survive and...


946
00:48:53.691 --> 00:48:58.796
that is not something
that defines me or my power


947
00:48:58.829 --> 00:49:00.798
as an actor in this world.

948
00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:03.735
I... I would say,
much more fundamentally,


949
00:49:03.767 --> 00:49:08.206
I'm an animal and I have hands
and I have feet


950
00:49:08.238 --> 00:49:11.508
and I can walk places
and I can do things.


951
00:49:12.510 --> 00:49:14.912
And I have a voice...

952
00:49:15.713 --> 00:49:19.083
and I have the ability
to speak with people


953
00:49:19.115 --> 00:49:21.151
and to build
a relationship with people.


954
00:49:21.184 --> 00:49:23.688
And I have the ability
to organize...


955
00:49:24.354 --> 00:49:28.025
and I have the ability
to fight if need be.


956
00:49:28.059 --> 00:49:30.461
These are all
much more important


957
00:49:30.494 --> 00:49:33.898
than my ability to buy
or not buy something.


958
00:49:38.802 --> 00:49:40.871
So, if I'm a person
who comes to this event,


959
00:49:40.905 --> 00:49:44.742
I'm going to come away thinking that to
solve the world's environmental problems,


960
00:49:44.775 --> 00:49:47.412
I need to buy an electric car,

961
00:49:47.445 --> 00:49:51.448
um, buy clothing made out
of bamboo and organic cotton


962
00:49:51.481 --> 00:49:55.352
and get a reusable water bottle
and a bamboo toothbrush.


963
00:49:55.385 --> 00:49:58.322
None of these things
are sufficient to address


964
00:49:58.356 --> 00:50:00.591
the problems
facing the natural world,


965
00:50:00.624 --> 00:50:04.062
and these are all just
luxury items being produced,


966
00:50:04.095 --> 00:50:05.930
that nobody really needs.

967
00:50:14.604 --> 00:50:17.675
<i>If we're going to tackle
this on a meaningful level,</i>


968
00:50:17.708 --> 00:50:19.610
<i>we need to address
the root causes</i>


969
00:50:19.642 --> 00:50:21.945
<i>of this
culture's unsustainability.</i>


970
00:50:23.414 --> 00:50:25.583
<i>Contrary to what we often hear,</i>

971
00:50:25.615 --> 00:50:27.251
<i>climate change did not begin</i>

972
00:50:27.284 --> 00:50:29.653
<i>with the burning
of fossil fuels.</i>


973
00:50:29.686 --> 00:50:31.355
<i>It started much earlier.</i>

974
00:50:32.689 --> 00:50:35.392
The beginning of
global warming is actually


975
00:50:35.425 --> 00:50:36.960
the beginning of agriculture.

976
00:50:36.994 --> 00:50:38.996
I mean, we've all seen that,
kind of, the hockey stick graph.


977
00:50:39.028 --> 00:50:41.131
Fossil fuel has
this huge CO2 release,


978
00:50:41.164 --> 00:50:43.967
and so it, you know, all of a
sudden, just boom, starts going up,


979
00:50:44.001 --> 00:50:46.504
and that's true, but if
you back that up 10,000 years,


980
00:50:46.537 --> 00:50:49.540
human activity actually
released that much carbon


981
00:50:49.572 --> 00:50:52.509
from the beginning
of agriculture to the year 1800,


982
00:50:52.543 --> 00:50:54.778
as we did from 1800 till now.

983
00:50:54.811 --> 00:50:56.380
So how?
How... what is this about?


984
00:50:56.414 --> 00:50:59.083
Well, huge amounts of carbon
are stored in soil,


985
00:50:59.115 --> 00:51:00.684
and when you do agriculture,

986
00:51:00.717 --> 00:51:02.786
you're destroying
the soil, essentially.


987
00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:06.858
So, as the soil falls to pieces,
all that carbon is released.


988
00:51:10.226 --> 00:51:13.263
We live in
an agricultural society


989
00:51:13.296 --> 00:51:14.898
which makes it really...

990
00:51:15.599 --> 00:51:19.437
hard for us to examine
the nature of agriculture.


991
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:22.273
To us, it's like air.
It's just what's there.


992
00:51:22.305 --> 00:51:25.543
It's just how things happen,
like, how we get food.


993
00:51:25.575 --> 00:51:27.778
There's not even a question
that there's another way,


994
00:51:27.811 --> 00:51:30.380
because this has been
happening now for so long.


995
00:51:30.414 --> 00:51:34.452
10,000 years is... is how long some
humans have been doing agriculture.


996
00:51:34.485 --> 00:51:36.253
I mean, agriculture started
in probably


997
00:51:36.287 --> 00:51:38.423
14 different places
around the globe.


998
00:51:38.456 --> 00:51:41.858
And it always starts in river valleys,
and there's a reason for that.


999
00:51:41.892 --> 00:51:45.296
The reason is that agriculture
is based on annual grasses,


1000
00:51:45.329 --> 00:51:47.832
and where you're going to
get the most annual grasses


1001
00:51:47.865 --> 00:51:49.000
is in river valleys.

1002
00:51:49.032 --> 00:51:50.634
So, there's two
different kinds of plants.


1003
00:51:50.668 --> 00:51:52.503
There's annuals
and there's perennials.


1004
00:51:52.535 --> 00:51:54.238
Annuals only live one year.

1005
00:51:54.271 --> 00:51:55.939
That's why
they're called annual.


1006
00:51:55.972 --> 00:51:57.874
And the perennials
live a long time.


1007
00:51:57.907 --> 00:52:00.677
So the annuals, their moment is

1008
00:52:00.711 --> 00:52:03.414
when there is a disturbance
across the landscape.


1009
00:52:03.447 --> 00:52:05.916
So a fire, a flood,
an earthquake.


1010
00:52:05.950 --> 00:52:08.718
What happens is
that the ground is bare,


1011
00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:13.157
and the planet recognizes this
as a biological emergency.


1012
00:52:13.189 --> 00:52:17.394
So, you know, nature has come up with
ways to fix this as fast as it can.


1013
00:52:17.427 --> 00:52:19.130
And the answer is annuals.

1014
00:52:19.162 --> 00:52:22.065
When there is no competition,
the annuals spring to life.


1015
00:52:22.099 --> 00:52:25.503
So one way to think about it is,
they're the first responders,


1016
00:52:25.535 --> 00:52:27.238
or think about, you know,
if you cut yourself


1017
00:52:27.271 --> 00:52:29.573
with a knife or a pair
of scissors or something,


1018
00:52:29.606 --> 00:52:31.441
um, you're going
to put a Band-Aid on that.


1019
00:52:31.474 --> 00:52:33.610
And that's what the annuals are,
they're the Band-Aid.


1020
00:52:33.644 --> 00:52:37.615
And eventually, just like your
skin will knit back together,


1021
00:52:37.648 --> 00:52:39.450
the roots of the perennials
will come back.


1022
00:52:39.483 --> 00:52:43.554
Those perennial plants will close
in across that disaster area again,


1023
00:52:43.586 --> 00:52:48.358
and there will be that tightly knit
web of perennial roots once more.


1024
00:52:48.392 --> 00:52:50.928
But until that happens,
all you have is annuals.


1025
00:52:50.961 --> 00:52:54.564
So 95% of plants are perennials,
on the planet,


1026
00:52:54.597 --> 00:52:55.999
and about 5% are annuals.

1027
00:52:56.032 --> 00:52:57.735
So, they certainly
have their role,


1028
00:52:57.767 --> 00:52:59.637
but there's no landscapes
where it's just annuals.


1029
00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:01.505
That's the problem
with agriculture,


1030
00:53:01.539 --> 00:53:04.041
is that it's based on
these annual grasses.


1031
00:53:04.073 --> 00:53:06.476
Now, the only way you're
going to get those to grow


1032
00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:08.345
is to clear
the life off the land.


1033
00:53:08.378 --> 00:53:10.814
They can't compete
against the perennials.


1034
00:53:10.847 --> 00:53:14.050
So, for 10,000 years we've,
essentially, been waging a war.


1035
00:53:14.084 --> 00:53:16.420
So, if you think about
what agriculture is


1036
00:53:16.452 --> 00:53:18.121
on a really, just basic scale...

1037
00:53:18.889 --> 00:53:20.758
you take a piece of land,

1038
00:53:20.791 --> 00:53:23.093
you clear
every living thing off it,


1039
00:53:23.126 --> 00:53:25.028
and I mean down to the bacteria,

1040
00:53:25.061 --> 00:53:27.130
and then you plant it
to human use.


1041
00:53:27.164 --> 00:53:28.533
So, it's biotic cleansing.

1042
00:53:28.566 --> 00:53:30.401
I mean, we've all heard
of ethnic cleansing.


1043
00:53:30.434 --> 00:53:33.070
Well, this is the same thing,
except it's not just humans.


1044
00:53:33.102 --> 00:53:35.005
It's every last living creature.

1045
00:53:35.039 --> 00:53:36.006
Just gone.

1046
00:53:37.073 --> 00:53:39.644
So, it's this massive war
that we've been waging.


1047
00:53:39.677 --> 00:53:42.079
And every season
you have to keep it up,


1048
00:53:42.112 --> 00:53:44.115
because, of course,
life fights back.


1049
00:53:44.148 --> 00:53:45.316
Life wants to live.

1050
00:53:46.083 --> 00:53:47.651
The problem now is so bad,

1051
00:53:47.684 --> 00:53:50.887
that 98% of the world's
old growth forests


1052
00:53:50.921 --> 00:53:55.092
and 99% of the world's
grasslands have been destroyed.


1053
00:53:55.124 --> 00:53:57.460
And this is all in
the service of agriculture.


1054
00:53:57.494 --> 00:53:59.363
So, humans have taken over

1055
00:53:59.396 --> 00:54:02.767
every piece of land that could
be taken for this activity.


1056
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.235
There's nothing left to take.

1057
00:54:05.235 --> 00:54:08.072
What this means is that

1058
00:54:08.104 --> 00:54:09.139
each and every day.

1059
00:54:09.173 --> 00:54:10.708
They haven't
just been extirpated.


1060
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.175
They're gone forever...

1061
00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:15.947
um, and that's what we've done,
by taking up agriculture.


1062
00:54:18.782 --> 00:54:21.218
They say that agriculture
increases food production,


1063
00:54:21.251 --> 00:54:22.887
but that's completely false.

1064
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:26.157
What it does, it grossly
decreases food production,


1065
00:54:26.189 --> 00:54:28.726
but it funnels whatever
food production there is


1066
00:54:28.758 --> 00:54:29.626
towards humans.

1067
00:54:30.494 --> 00:54:33.363
Um, but in terms
of actual food production,


1068
00:54:33.396 --> 00:54:36.333
when you include food production for
all the non humans who live here?


1069
00:54:36.367 --> 00:54:38.903
No, it's... it's grossly reduced.

1070
00:54:39.602 --> 00:54:42.039
And one of things
that agriculture does


1071
00:54:42.072 --> 00:54:45.443
is it commits you to
a path of further destruction,


1072
00:54:45.476 --> 00:54:48.778
because you have
more food for humans,


1073
00:54:48.811 --> 00:54:53.450
but you do so at the cost
of the health of the land base.


1074
00:54:53.483 --> 00:54:57.787
So, you slowly decrease the
carrying capacity of the land base,


1075
00:54:57.820 --> 00:54:58.789
because you've overshot it.

1076
00:54:59.555 --> 00:55:02.325
And as you destroy
your land base,


1077
00:55:02.358 --> 00:55:04.227
you have a choice.
You can either collapse...


1078
00:55:05.128 --> 00:55:08.231
or you can continue to find
new frontiers to exploit.


1079
00:55:09.233 --> 00:55:10.901
The problem is somebody else
already lives there,


1080
00:55:10.934 --> 00:55:12.970
which means your way of life
has to be militarized,


1081
00:55:13.003 --> 00:55:14.271
because you're going
to conquer them.


1082
00:55:15.673 --> 00:55:18.476
And also you have to destroy the
environment of the places nearby.


1083
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:22.079
So, this is an
inherently destructive activity,


1084
00:55:22.112 --> 00:55:25.282
and it kind of snowballs into
worse and worse things.


1085
00:55:25.314 --> 00:55:26.784
So, the moment
you clear that land,


1086
00:55:26.816 --> 00:55:29.352
that soil
starts being destroyed.


1087
00:55:29.385 --> 00:55:32.956
One season of planting
your annual crop,


1088
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:35.459
you know, pick whichever,
wheat, soy, corn...


1089
00:55:35.492 --> 00:55:38.362
you can lose 2000 years
worth of top soil.


1090
00:55:38.394 --> 00:55:42.166
That's how slowly topsoil grows
and how easily it is destroyed.


1091
00:55:42.198 --> 00:55:45.068
When the Europeans
first got to the Midwest,


1092
00:55:45.101 --> 00:55:47.570
the prairie soil
was 12 feet deep,


1093
00:55:47.604 --> 00:55:49.340
and it can now
only be measured in inches.


1094
00:55:49.372 --> 00:55:51.242
So, it's gone.
We blew through it all,


1095
00:55:51.275 --> 00:55:53.043
in a very short period of time.

1096
00:55:53.077 --> 00:55:55.112
So, that's the nature
of agriculture.


1097
00:55:55.144 --> 00:55:56.079
Like, there's not...

1098
00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:59.583
a better way to do this.
There's not, like, a kinder,


1099
00:55:59.615 --> 00:56:01.284
gentler form of agriculture.

1100
00:56:01.318 --> 00:56:02.920
It's literally what it is.

1101
00:56:02.952 --> 00:56:06.756
You remove all the life,
and then you draw down the soil,


1102
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:09.059
and in the process,
you also draw down water


1103
00:56:09.092 --> 00:56:11.061
and you draw down species

1104
00:56:11.095 --> 00:56:13.130
and you draw down
entire biotic communities.


1105
00:56:16.599 --> 00:56:20.438
The fertile crescent is
where a lot of these problems started.


1106
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:23.641
And you've seen it now, and it doesn't
look like a fertile crescent at all.


1107
00:56:23.673 --> 00:56:26.009
It's treeless,
horizon to horizon,


1108
00:56:26.043 --> 00:56:27.711
but that was before
the beginnings of this culture.


1109
00:56:27.744 --> 00:56:30.246
That was cedar forests, so thick that
sunlight never touched the ground.


1110
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.084
It was like this. Thicker, because
sunlight's touching the ground over there.


1111
00:56:33.816 --> 00:56:36.086
And this culture
has destroyed that.


1112
00:56:36.119 --> 00:56:38.121
Converted it to agriculture
and then converted it to desert.


1113
00:56:38.155 --> 00:56:39.423
That's what happens.

1114
00:56:39.456 --> 00:56:42.392
Forests precede us,
and deserts dog our heels.


1115
00:56:43.693 --> 00:56:46.963
During the era of
the black plague in Europe,


1116
00:56:46.997 --> 00:56:49.867
anywhere from, like,
one third to three quarters


1117
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:52.369
of the population died,
depending on where you were.


1118
00:56:52.401 --> 00:56:55.338
So what happened pretty quickly,
was all the agricultural fields


1119
00:56:55.372 --> 00:56:58.409
were... were abandoned, because
there were no people left.


1120
00:56:58.441 --> 00:57:00.110
And the forest
starts to take over.


1121
00:57:00.144 --> 00:57:03.080
And there's actually a dip in
the carbon in the atmosphere,


1122
00:57:03.113 --> 00:57:05.483
because Europe was,
at least partially reforested,


1123
00:57:05.516 --> 00:57:06.684
at that... at that moment.

1124
00:57:07.383 --> 00:57:09.954
So, you can see that, actually,
it responds pretty quickly.


1125
00:57:09.987 --> 00:57:11.889
Um, if we could get some plants
back in the ground,


1126
00:57:11.921 --> 00:57:13.690
that can sequester carbon...

1127
00:57:13.724 --> 00:57:14.825
it could happen.

1128
00:57:14.858 --> 00:57:17.327
And this is why I am not,
in any way, out of hope.


1129
00:57:18.028 --> 00:57:22.066
If we were to repair even 75%

1130
00:57:22.099 --> 00:57:25.468
of the trashed-out
prairies in the United States,


1131
00:57:25.501 --> 00:57:28.371
in about ten years,
we could sequester


1132
00:57:28.405 --> 00:57:32.575
all of the carbon that we have
released in this country.


1133
00:57:32.608 --> 00:57:36.412
Basically, period. We would actually
become a nation that sequesters carbon.


1134
00:57:36.445 --> 00:57:41.151
Around the globe, if we could repair

1135
00:57:41.184 --> 00:57:44.721
we could sequester all of
the carbon that's been released


1136
00:57:44.755 --> 00:57:47.224
since the beginning
of the industrial age till now,


1137
00:57:47.256 --> 00:57:48.825
and pretty quickly.

1138
00:57:48.858 --> 00:57:50.360
And that's really
all it takes is,


1139
00:57:50.394 --> 00:57:52.196
we... we have to just
let life come back.


1140
00:57:59.869 --> 00:58:02.372
<i>Fish sequester
carbon in their bodies</i>


1141

<i>and excrete gut rocks,</i>

1147
00:58:20.891 --> 00:58:24.260

1148
00:58:24.293 --> 00:58:27.831

1157

<i>♪ Climate change

1160
00:59:05.369 --> 00:59:08.305
I'm here at the
climate march in Montreal.


1161
00:59:08.338 --> 00:59:11.275
They're expecting
about 300,000 people today,


1162
00:59:11.307 --> 00:59:14.210
mostly youth,
who are here marching,


1163
00:59:14.244 --> 00:59:16.146
thinking that they're
fighting for their futures


1164
00:59:16.179 --> 00:59:18.249
and they're fighting
to stop climate change,


1165
00:59:18.282 --> 00:59:21.117
but when you look at
the explicitly stated demands


1166
00:59:21.151 --> 00:59:23.821
of the big organizations
who are putting this together,


1167
00:59:23.854 --> 00:59:26.657
what they're asking for,
is a swift transition


1168
00:59:26.689 --> 00:59:28.358
to 100% renewable energy.

1169
00:59:29.325 --> 00:59:32.996
So, that's not going to stop,
or even slow climate change.


1170
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:34.665
It's only going
to make things worse.


1171
00:59:35.365 --> 00:59:37.434

- <i>♪ Climate justice! ♪</i>


1172

- <i>♪ Now! ♪</i>


1173
00:59:41.003 --> 00:59:42.939
The thing that blows me
away, is the length


1174
00:59:42.972 --> 00:59:44.842
to which people will go

1175
00:59:44.874 --> 00:59:46.811
in order to avoid
looking at the problem.


1176
00:59:47.677 --> 00:59:50.113
That they will
create all these...


1177
00:59:50.146 --> 00:59:52.650
extraordinary fantasies,
in order to do something


1178
00:59:52.682 --> 00:59:54.217
that's not
going to help the planet,


1179
00:59:54.251 --> 00:59:55.886
so they can avoid
looking at the real issue,


1180
00:59:55.918 --> 00:59:56.720
which is that...

1181
00:59:57.988 --> 01:00:01.025
industrial civilization itself
is what's killing the planet.


1182
01:00:02.124 --> 01:00:04.829
So, this word civilization.
What does that actually mean?


1183
01:00:05.595 --> 01:00:07.031
Well, just etymologically,

1184
01:00:07.063 --> 01:00:09.465
it means people
living in cities.


1185
01:00:09.499 --> 01:00:11.735
Okay, but what
does that actually mean?


1186
01:00:11.767 --> 01:00:15.539
Well, it means people living
in densities large enough,


1187
01:00:15.572 --> 01:00:18.275
that they require
the importation of resources.


1188
01:00:18.307 --> 01:00:21.045
So, just think about this
common sense level.


1189
01:00:21.077 --> 01:00:25.448
Eight million people cannot live
on an island called Manhattan.


1190
01:00:25.481 --> 01:00:27.016
Right? Where does
their food come from?


1191
01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:29.687
Where does the water come from?
Where does the energy come from?


1192
01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:31.522
And that's the problem
with cities, okay?


1193
01:00:31.555 --> 01:00:33.557
The city has used up its own.

1194
01:00:33.590 --> 01:00:35.124
Whatever it is, it's not there.

1195
01:00:35.157 --> 01:00:36.759
So, now where are they
going to get it?


1196
01:00:36.793 --> 01:00:40.597
Well, from that point forward,
it doesn't actually matter


1197
01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:44.834
what kinds of beautiful,
peaceful, nonviolent...


1198
01:00:44.867 --> 01:00:47.670
spiritual values
people hold in their hearts.


1199
01:00:47.704 --> 01:00:51.374
Your society is now dependent
on imperialism and genocide,


1200
01:00:52.142 --> 01:00:55.145
because nobody willingly
gives up their land,


1201
01:00:55.177 --> 01:00:58.147
their water,
their trees, their fish,


1202
01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.883
but since the city
has used up its own,


1203
01:00:59.916 --> 01:01:02.086
it's got to go out and
get those from somewhere else.


1204
01:01:02.119 --> 01:01:04.921
So, the pattern of civilization
is always the same.


1205
01:01:04.954 --> 01:01:07.991
You've got this bloated power
center, right at the middle,


1206
01:01:08.025 --> 01:01:10.026
and then it's surrounded
by conquered colonies.


1207
01:01:10.059 --> 01:01:12.262
And the power center
takes whatever it can,


1208
01:01:12.295 --> 01:01:15.164
brings it all back in.
Eventually, it collapses,


1209
01:01:15.197 --> 01:01:18.234
because we're on drawdown.
We're on overshoot.


1210
01:01:18.267 --> 01:01:21.405
Historically speaking,
civilizations had a natural end point.


1211
01:01:21.438 --> 01:01:24.541
They were only going to get so big
before they eventually would collapse.


1212
01:01:24.573 --> 01:01:26.443
And so that's what you see.
Whether it's South America,


1213
01:01:26.476 --> 01:01:28.945
North America, Asia,
Africa, Europe.


1214
01:01:28.979 --> 01:01:30.948
It's the same pattern
over and over.


1215
01:01:30.981 --> 01:01:33.217
There have been

1216
01:01:33.249 --> 01:01:34.517
They have all ended in collapse.

1217
01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:36.186
This one will be no different.

1218
01:01:36.218 --> 01:01:39.423
The only difference is this...
this one right now, you know, we've...


1219
01:01:39.456 --> 01:01:42.793
we've added this incredible
accelerant of fossil fuel.


1220
01:01:43.927 --> 01:01:46.963
You know,
I grew up in Seattle and...


1221
01:01:46.997 --> 01:01:49.299
what is now downtown Seattle,

1222
01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:53.670
with skyscrapers and concrete,
as far as you can see,


1223
01:01:53.702 --> 01:01:57.840
used to be old growth forest,
with cedar and Douglas fir


1224
01:01:57.874 --> 01:02:01.278
and hemlock and maple
and all these other trees.


1225
01:02:01.311 --> 01:02:05.516
Old growth trees, thousands
upon thousands of years old.


1226
01:02:05.548 --> 01:02:08.651
The trees in the urban areas
of the Pacific Northwest,


1227
01:02:08.684 --> 01:02:10.787
for example, in Vancouver, B.C.,

1228
01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:14.023
what's now downtown Vancouver,

1229
01:02:14.057 --> 01:02:16.560
used to be old growth forests.

1230
01:02:16.592 --> 01:02:19.695
And there used to be
trees 400 feet tall there,


1231
01:02:19.729 --> 01:02:21.265
and there's records of this.

1232
01:02:21.298 --> 01:02:24.368
And those trees, they were
Douglas firs in this case,


1233
01:02:24.401 --> 01:02:26.670
those would be the tallest trees
in the world today.


1234
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:29.773
People think the redwoods are
the tallest trees in the world,


1235
01:02:29.805 --> 01:02:32.508
and it's only because
the tallest Douglas firs,


1236
01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:34.277
who are quite a bit taller...

1237
01:02:34.311 --> 01:02:35.345
have all been cut down.

1238
01:02:36.747 --> 01:02:39.350
And they were cut down, among other
things, to build these cities.


1239
01:02:41.184 --> 01:02:43.387
We, in this
culture, have come to conflate


1240
01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.588
this way of life
with all life on the planet.


1241
01:02:45.622 --> 01:02:47.491
If I say,
"I want to end civilization."


1242
01:02:47.523 --> 01:02:50.193
They say,
"Oh, you want to end life."


1243
01:02:50.226 --> 01:02:53.026
But the problem is that
this culture is ending life.


1244
01:02:53.028 --> 01:02:55.099
And some people have accused me
of being cruel,


1245
01:02:55.131 --> 01:02:57.400
because I want
to bring down civilization,


1246
01:02:57.434 --> 01:02:59.702
and that will make it so,
people who...


1247
01:02:59.735 --> 01:03:03.173
are reliant upon
modern medicines will die.


1248
01:03:04.106 --> 01:03:07.143
I have Crohn's disease
and coronary artery disease,


1249
01:03:07.177 --> 01:03:08.179
and without...

1250
01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.648
modern medicines, I would die.

1251
01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.816
I am one of those people...

1252
01:03:14.584 --> 01:03:17.788
but I realize that the world
is more important than I am.


1253
01:03:23.492 --> 01:03:25.161
Um, I think a lot of people...

1254
01:03:25.195 --> 01:03:26.863
You know, the easier thing,
is to say things like,


1255
01:03:26.896 --> 01:03:28.599
"Well, it's greed
is the problem."


1256
01:03:28.631 --> 01:03:30.633
It's like...
Okay, so...


1257
01:03:30.666 --> 01:03:33.769
We actually have a society,
that is not just about greed.


1258
01:03:33.802 --> 01:03:37.907
I mean, we actually
reward greed on a massive scale.


1259
01:03:37.941 --> 01:03:39.810
All right, so, like,
what are the social rewards?


1260
01:03:39.842 --> 01:03:42.245
What are the political rewards?
What are the financial rewards?


1261
01:03:42.278 --> 01:03:43.981
Well, that system
is actually called capitalism,


1262
01:03:44.014 --> 01:03:46.282
at least right now. I mean,
there's certainly other versions of it.


1263
01:03:46.316 --> 01:03:47.784
I don't mean to say
it's the only one,


1264
01:03:47.816 --> 01:03:49.920
but right now it's capitalism
across the globe,


1265
01:03:49.952 --> 01:03:51.387
and that's what it does.

1266
01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:53.290
All right,
it takes living communities.


1267
01:03:53.322 --> 01:03:55.625
It converts those
into dead commodities.


1268
01:03:55.659 --> 01:03:59.997
And then those dead commodities
are turned into private wealth.


1269
01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:03.167
And a lot of people think, "Well,
if we just make that into public wealth.


1270
01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:05.269
If we all could get
an equal piece of the pie,


1271
01:04:05.302 --> 01:04:07.771
that's the solution."
This is the problem,


1272
01:04:07.804 --> 01:04:09.472
There's not
going to be a solution,


1273
01:04:09.505 --> 01:04:11.841
because you've still got the
first two parts of that equation.


1274
01:04:11.874 --> 01:04:13.476
Why are we
taking the living planet,


1275
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:15.179
and turning it
into dead commodities?


1276
01:04:15.211 --> 01:04:16.345
Like, that's the problem.

1277
01:04:16.378 --> 01:04:18.181
I don't actually care.
in the end...


1278
01:04:18.215 --> 01:04:20.083
who gets all the...
all the goodies.


1279
01:04:20.115 --> 01:04:21.318
It's the fact that...

1280
01:04:22.052 --> 01:04:24.854
like, rivers and grasslands
and forests and fish


1281
01:04:24.887 --> 01:04:27.623
have been turned into those dead
commodities. That's the problem.


1282
01:04:30.327 --> 01:04:31.727
What do all
the so-called "solutions"


1283
01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.296
to global warming
have in common?


1284
01:04:33.329 --> 01:04:35.431
They all take industrial
capitalism as a given.


1285
01:04:35.465 --> 01:04:38.202
The natural world is having to
conform to industrial capitalism.


1286
01:04:38.235 --> 01:04:41.271
They've switched the dependent,
independent variables, that...


1287
01:04:42.606 --> 01:04:44.608
The world has to be primary
and the health of the world


1288
01:04:44.641 --> 01:04:46.175
has to be primary,
because without a world,


1289
01:04:46.209 --> 01:04:47.811
you don't have
any economy whatsoever.


1290
01:04:48.945 --> 01:04:51.081
And the Bright Greens are
very explicit about this.


1291
01:04:51.113 --> 01:04:54.184
What they're trying to save is industrial
capitalism, industrial civilization.


1292
01:04:54.217 --> 01:04:56.487
They say this
all the time, and...


1293
01:04:58.421 --> 01:04:59.923
that's my fundamental beef,

1294
01:04:59.956 --> 01:05:01.925
is that what I'm trying
to save is the real world.


1295
01:05:04.894 --> 01:05:08.131
<i>Bright Green environmentalism
has gained popularity,</i>


1296
01:05:08.164 --> 01:05:11.267
<i>because it tells a lot of
people what they want to hear.</i>


1297
01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:15.038
<i>That you can have industrial
civilization and a planet, too.</i>


1298
01:05:16.338 --> 01:05:21.043
<i>It allows people to feel good about
maintaining this destructive way of living,</i>


1299
01:05:21.077 --> 01:05:23.680
<i>and to avoid
asking hard questions,</i>


1300
01:05:23.713 --> 01:05:25.950
<i>about the depth
of what must be changed.</i>


1301
01:05:28.617 --> 01:05:31.354
I think that a

1302
01:05:31.387 --> 01:05:34.123
would not look very different
than the one we live in now.


1303
01:05:34.157 --> 01:05:37.260
Even if you snapped your fingers
and that happened tomorrow,


1304
01:05:37.293 --> 01:05:40.763
I think that global warming would
continue to be a huge problem.


1305
01:05:40.796 --> 01:05:44.066
You'd still have all
the emissions from logging,


1306
01:05:44.099 --> 01:05:46.102
from concrete production,
from steel production,


1307
01:05:46.135 --> 01:05:49.472
from consumer goods,
from global shipping.


1308
01:05:49.505 --> 01:05:51.274
From all these things.

1309
01:05:51.307 --> 01:05:53.443
And, of course,
that renewable energy


1310
01:05:53.476 --> 01:05:55.479
would still be used...

1311
01:05:56.512 --> 01:05:59.215
to power this,
to power the global economy.


1312
01:06:02.885 --> 01:06:05.221
If space aliens
came down from outer space,


1313
01:06:05.255 --> 01:06:07.423
and they were
changing the climate...


1314
01:06:08.291 --> 01:06:10.628
and they were
putting in mines everywhere...


1315
01:06:11.327 --> 01:06:16.032
we wouldn't care
whether the mined materials


1316
01:06:16.066 --> 01:06:19.436
are going to be used
to make windmills,


1317
01:06:19.468 --> 01:06:21.505
or to make solar panels

1318
01:06:21.537 --> 01:06:24.874
to power the alien economy.

1319
01:06:24.907 --> 01:06:26.509
The occupier economy.

1320
01:06:26.543 --> 01:06:29.278
What we would do is,
we would stop the occupiers.


1321
01:06:29.311 --> 01:06:31.814
We would... we would
do whatever necessary,


1322
01:06:31.847 --> 01:06:34.817
to make it so these space aliens
can't change our climate.


1323
01:06:34.851 --> 01:06:37.521
And when you change
your loyalty from the system,


1324
01:06:37.554 --> 01:06:40.289
to the planet,
it does become their economy,


1325
01:06:40.322 --> 01:06:41.391
not our economy.

1326
01:06:42.559 --> 01:06:44.795
And it does become a matter
of stopping their economy.


1327
01:06:49.833 --> 01:06:53.137
<i>There's war being waged
on the natural world every day.</i>


1328
01:06:53.903 --> 01:06:56.206
<i>Yet, when we talk about
fighting back...</i>


1329
01:06:57.374 --> 01:06:59.642
<i>people look at us
like we're crazy...</i>


1330
01:07:00.677 --> 01:07:04.280
<i>The vast majority of
environmentalists in this culture</i>


1331
01:07:04.313 --> 01:07:06.316
<i>do not perceive that
we are in a war.</i>


1332
01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:11.354
<i>They love this culture and they
see that it has some problems.</i>


1333
01:07:11.387 --> 01:07:16.092
<i>And I see that we're living
in a culture that is not broken.</i>


1334
01:07:16.126 --> 01:07:17.928
<i>It was set up this way.</i>

1335
01:07:17.961 --> 01:07:20.664
<i>It was set up
to exploit and to steal</i>


1336
01:07:20.697 --> 01:07:25.135
<i>and to use violence
to take what it needs.</i>


1337
01:07:25.168 --> 01:07:27.204
<i>That's the history
of this culture,</i>


1338
01:07:27.237 --> 01:07:30.807
<i>and I do not see
how to stop it without force.</i>


1339
01:07:34.744 --> 01:07:37.081
What I don't understand
is why we're not fighting back.


1340
01:07:37.981 --> 01:07:40.684
Because what I do know
is that if there's anybody alive


1341
01:07:40.717 --> 01:07:43.119
to look back

1342
01:07:43.153 --> 01:07:46.289
they are going to wonder what
the fuck was wrong with us.


1343
01:07:46.322 --> 01:07:49.291
That we didn't fight
when the planet was going down.


1344
01:07:49.325 --> 01:07:52.796
Now, you love something or you
wouldn't be listening to this.


1345
01:07:52.829 --> 01:07:55.164
Whatever you love,
it is under assault.


1346
01:07:56.131 --> 01:07:57.233
But "love" is a verb.

1347
01:07:57.934 --> 01:08:00.970
We've got to let our love
call us to action.


1348
01:08:06.709 --> 01:08:09.780
<i>I spent three years
making a film about the ocean.</i>


1349
01:08:11.481 --> 01:08:13.617
<i>It is only now that I've learned</i>

1350
01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:17.087
<i>that the production of
so-called "green technology"</i>


1351
01:08:17.119 --> 01:08:21.124
<i>represents one of the largest
upcoming threats to the ocean.</i>


1352
01:08:22.591 --> 01:08:24.860
<i>They want to mine the deep sea,</i>

1353
01:08:24.894 --> 01:08:28.364
<i>to provide the materials
necessary for the proliferation</i>


1354
01:08:28.398 --> 01:08:30.801
<i>of so-called "green technology."</i>

1355
01:08:31.967 --> 01:08:35.771
<i>A recent study estimates
that two million cubic-feet</i>


1356
01:08:35.805 --> 01:08:40.209
<i>of sediment will be processed
each day by each mining vessel.</i>


1357
01:08:40.944 --> 01:08:43.981
<i>The resulting slurry will be
dumped back into the ocean...</i>


1358
01:08:44.681 --> 01:08:46.683
<i>where it will
increase turbidity,</i>


1359
01:08:46.716 --> 01:08:49.419
<i>smother and bury organisms</i>

1360
01:08:49.452 --> 01:08:52.088
<i>and toxify the food web
with heavy metals.</i>


1361
01:08:55.024 --> 01:08:58.727
<i>The ocean, which is
the source of all life...</i>


1362
01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:01.631
<i>has become
the next sacrifice zone,</i>


1363
01:09:01.663 --> 01:09:04.300
<i>in the name of green technology.</i>

1364
01:09:06.135 --> 01:09:09.206
<i>People claim that
the future of electric cars</i>


1365
01:09:09.239 --> 01:09:11.108
<i>may depend on deep sea mining.</i>

1366
01:09:12.441 --> 01:09:14.810
<i>What if we switched
what is primary</i>


1367
01:09:14.843 --> 01:09:18.215
<i>and instead said,
that the future of the ocean</i>


1368
01:09:18.248 --> 01:09:20.451
<i>depends on stopping car culture?</i>

1369
01:09:21.583 --> 01:09:24.854
<i>Or that the future of the ocean
depends on opposing</i>


1370
01:09:24.887 --> 01:09:26.722
<i>so-called "green technology?"</i>

1371
01:09:29.225 --> 01:09:32.195
<i>Evidently, this culture
does not care</i>


1372
01:09:32.227 --> 01:09:34.064
<i>whether the ocean has a future.</i>

1373
01:09:35.364 --> 01:09:37.501
<i>It's more interested
in justifying</i>


1374
01:09:37.533 --> 01:09:39.468
<i>continued exploitation</i>

1375
01:09:39.502 --> 01:09:42.072
<i>under the banner
of green consumerism.</i>


1376
01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:46.776
<i>What we desperately need,
is an environmental movement</i>


1377
01:09:46.809 --> 01:09:48.744
<i>that's willing
to put nature first.</i>


1378
01:09:49.913 --> 01:09:52.315
<i>That's willing to
put life on this planet</i>


1379
01:09:52.347 --> 01:09:53.883
<i>above this way of life.</i>

1380
01:09:55.184 --> 01:09:58.588
<i>We need people who will look
honestly at the problems</i>


1381
01:09:58.621 --> 01:10:01.257
<i>and have the courage
to ask the right questions.</i>


1382
01:10:03.091 --> 01:10:05.661
<i>Most importantly,
we need to get to work.</i>


1383
01:10:06.429 --> 01:10:08.398
<i>To stop the destruction</i>

1384
01:10:08.431 --> 01:10:10.033
<i>and allow life to come back.</i>

1385
01:10:21.633 --> 01:10:26.633
