00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:32.588
<i>Last night I dreamed a deadly dream.</i>

2
00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:36.269
<i>Beyond the Isle of Skye...</i>

3
00:00:36.304 --> 00:00:39.406
<i>I saw a dead man win a fight...</i>

4
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:43.399
<i>and I think that man was I.</i>

5
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.136
<i>This we may say...</i>

6
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:18.103
<i>the sun of victory...</i>

7
00:02:18.138 --> 00:02:22.131
<i>has begun to touch</i>
<i>our soldiersâ€™ helmets.</i>


8
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.302
<i>I have this day received</i>
<i>the following communication...</i>


9
00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:29.381
<i>from General Alexander:</i>

10
00:02:29.416 --> 00:02:32.419
<i>"Sir, the orders you gave me...</i>

11
00:02:32.454 --> 00:02:35.206
<i>"on August 15, 1942...</i>

12
00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:37.650
<i>"have been fulfilled.</i>

13
00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:40.025
<i>"His Majesty's enemies...</i>

14
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.794
<i>"together with their impedimenta...</i>

15
00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.566
<i>"have been completely</i>
<i>eliminated from Egypt...</i>


16
00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:50.559
<i>"Cyrenaica, 
Libya and Tripolitania.</i>

17
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.339
<i>I now await your further instructions. "</i>

18
00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:58.367
<i>Well, obviously we shall now</i>
<i>have to think of something else.</i>


19
00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.148
<i>I am sure the
House will bear with me...</i>

20
00:03:02.183 --> 00:03:05.152
<i>if I do not publicly proclaim...</i>

21
00:03:05.187 --> 00:03:08.086
<i>what that something else will be.</i>

22
00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:11.992
<i>Sicily, eh?</i>
<i>I suppose it was the obvious choice.</i>


23
00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:13.959
Too obvious.

24
00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:16.997
Here we are, all along the North African coast,
except for Tunisia...


25
00:03:17.032 --> 00:03:19.965
and here's Jerry opposite
from the Pyrenees to Greece.


26
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.803
He knows we're coming, and he knows
we're almost certain to come through here.


27
00:03:23.838 --> 00:03:27.272
All he's got to do
is to sit and wait for us.


28
00:03:27.307 --> 00:03:30.810
As a king's counsel, Montagu,
and a leading member of the bar...


29
00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:33.813
you've sometimes defended a man
in peril of his life.


30
00:03:33.848 --> 00:03:35.780
Yes, sir.

31
00:03:35.815 --> 00:03:39.217
Well, here's your chance
to defend thousands of men.


32
00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:43.245
If we land in Sicily now,
we shall have 30% casualties getting ashore.


33
00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:47.225
We sit in offices
and talk about casualties...


34
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.228
as though they were just figures
on a bit of paper.


35
00:03:50.263 --> 00:03:54.256
I take it the chiefs of staff
want us to think up a cover plan.


36
00:03:54.534 --> 00:03:57.537
One that'll make Jerry think
we're going somewhere else.


37
00:03:57.572 --> 00:03:59.573
Greece, Sardinia...

38
00:03:59.608 --> 00:04:01.539
the south of France.

39
00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:04.110
I'm told Corsica is very pleasant.

40
00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:06.077
But with respect, sir...

41
00:04:06.112 --> 00:04:08.114
the Germans know we need Sicily.

42
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:10.081
They must go on defending it.

43
00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:12.584
But we may make them
thin their defenses a bit...


44
00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.622
if they think the main attack
is coming somewhere else.


45
00:04:15.657 --> 00:04:19.615
You and your outfit
must drop everything for it.


46
00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.693
If we can get Jerry...

47
00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:23.980
to move one single battalion...

48
00:04:24.015 --> 00:04:26.197
a battery, or even a gun...

49
00:04:26.232 --> 00:04:29.200
it's going to save a lot of lives.

50
00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:33.228
Now, to your left
you will see a further wave of aircraft.


51
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.033
<i>Here you see the multicolored chutes</i>
<i>which are dropping before you.</i>


52
00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.946
<i>Ah, there's one taking a short cut.</i>

53
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:45.974
<i>That's what we call</i>
<i>jumping to a conclusion, gentlemen.</i>


54
00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:50.221
Just for a moment
I thought someone had had it.


55
00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:53.259
Me too. Those things aren't nearly as safe
as they're made out to be.


56
00:04:53.294 --> 00:04:56.227
I don't think there's
anything for us here, George.


57
00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:59.766
Any scheme that means using troops
would take far too long to set up.


58
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:03.759
Next phase:
"Use of natural cover. "


59
00:05:04.504 --> 00:05:08.497
Let's slide out.

60
00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:13.611
Monty, that parachute
that didn't open...


61
00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:17.250
Suppose we were to drop a fellow
out of a plane over enemy territory...


62
00:05:17.285 --> 00:05:20.253
with papers on him saying
we were going to invade Greece...


63
00:05:20.288 --> 00:05:22.255
and <i>his</i> parachute didn't open up.

64
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.257
The Germans would find him dead...

65
00:05:24.292 --> 00:05:26.224
and the papers...

66
00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.726
and "A-ha," they'd say, "look at this.

67
00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:31.764
"Officer with secret papers,
parachute didn't open...


68
00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:33.731
they're going to invade Greece. "

69
00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:36.734
Do we tell the man who jumps
that the parachute doesn't work...


70
00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:39.772
or is it a sort of practical joke
that he finds out on the way down?


71
00:05:39.807 --> 00:05:42.775
Well, of course it'd have to be somebody
we didn't mind much about.


72
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.742
Are you volunteering?

73
00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:46.744
No, George, it wouldn't work.

74
00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.247
What about using a man already dead?

75
00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:52.285
The autopsy would show he'd been dead
before he hit the ground.


76
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.555
Let's get back to the office
and think again.


77
00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:04.330
If those boys of yours drink any more coffee,
they won't be able to sleep.


78
00:06:04.365 --> 00:06:07.333
That won't worry them.
They gave up sleeping two days ago.


79
00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:28.310
Will you come and get it
while it's hot, sir?


80
00:06:29.022 --> 00:06:31.024
Monty, what we really want...

81
00:06:31.059 --> 00:06:32.991
is something absolutely simple.

82
00:06:33.026 --> 00:06:36.779
- The simpler the better.
- Good boy, George. You're absolutely right.


83
00:06:36.814 --> 00:06:40.609
How about this? Supposing we issue
Greek dictionaries to all the troops.


84
00:06:40.644 --> 00:06:44.404
Why should we do that unless we intend
to invade Greece? That'd fool 'em.


85
00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:47.740
I'd make it Eskimo dictionaries.
That would <i>really</i> fool them.


86
00:06:47.775 --> 00:06:50.208
Pam, first thing in the morning...

87
00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:53.246
I want you to get me
the fullest possible details...


88
00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:55.265
of the tides and currents between...

89
00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.215
Gibraltar
and the Portuguese border.


90
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.286
- Between where, sir?
- Gibraltar and the Portuguese border.


91
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:02.188
- Yes, sir.
- Going for a swim?


92
00:07:02.223 --> 00:07:04.155
No.
Sardine fishing.


93
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:07.193
Now, Pam, it's getting late.
You'd better get off home.


94
00:07:07.228 --> 00:07:10.196
Are you sure you don't want
some sandwiches before I go?


95
00:07:10.231 --> 00:07:13.467
My dear child,
you must try not to be so greedy.


96
00:07:13.502 --> 00:07:16.703
You think of nothing but my stomach.
Go on, hop it.


97
00:07:16.738 --> 00:07:20.696
Leave the coffee.

98
00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:24.711
Poor Pam.
How she does fuss over you.


99
00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:28.704
Close the door, George.

100
00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.619
Come here.

101
00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:38.658
That idea of yours yesterday about a dead body
and a parachute that doesn't open...


102
00:07:38.693 --> 00:07:40.625
Yes?

103
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.628
It won't work the
way you had it, but...

104
00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:46.666
I have an idea about something
that just might work.


105
00:07:50.464 --> 00:07:52.805
- Good night, miss.
- Good night.


106
00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.730
<i>You there, Lucy?</i>

107
00:08:50.765 --> 00:08:53.383
Come on in, Pam.

108
00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:55.967
Joe, this is Pam...

109
00:08:56.002 --> 00:08:58.004
who runs this war
pretty well single-handedly...


110
00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:00.006
from crack of dawn till midnight.

111
00:09:00.041 --> 00:09:01.906
Pam, this is Joe.

112
00:09:01.941 --> 00:09:03.908
- Hello.
- Hello, Pam.


113
00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:06.911
- Don't mind me. I'm just passing through.
- Good-bye, little train.


114
00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:10.216
<i>Before you puff off, shall I fix you a drink?</i>
<i>Joe brought gin.</i>


115
00:09:10.251 --> 00:09:12.183
Later.

116
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:14.485
So, that's Pam.

117
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.522
She looks all right.

118
00:09:16.557 --> 00:09:19.724
But, Lu...

119
00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:22.226
why don't you have
a place on your own?


120
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:25.229
This apartment belongs to her parents.
We get it rent-free.


121
00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:28.768
Besides, I need a nice, steady,
sensible girl around, and that's what Pam is.


122
00:09:28.803 --> 00:09:31.771
- I've gotta have somebody to protect me.
- From me?


123
00:09:31.806 --> 00:09:35.764
I hope so.

124
00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:40.702
- Come on. You've got to go.
- I know.


125
00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:42.915
- You flying tomorrow?
- Maybe.


126
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.882
I've never asked you this, Joe...

127
00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:47.418
- Does it scare you?
- I get used to it.


128
00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.956
- You'll ring me when you get back.
- As soon as I can.


129
00:09:49.991 --> 00:09:51.923
You won't ever forget to ring,
every evening.


130
00:09:51.958 --> 00:09:54.961
- Because if I didn't hear, I think I'd go mad.
- I'll ring, Lu.


131
00:09:54.996 --> 00:09:57.428
Or if anything stops me, 
Larry'll ring.

132
00:09:57.463 --> 00:10:01.456
- What do you mean, if anything stops you?
- Oh, just anything.


133
00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:16.447
- Home long?
- About 7:00.


134
00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:20.475
You were late. They certainly get their
money's worth out of you in that joint.


135
00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:24.390
So that's Joe.
I always thought he was an American.


136
00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:26.357
Maybe the one you're thinking of was.

137
00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:29.262
I don't know how you
keep away from these boys, Pam.


138
00:10:29.297 --> 00:10:31.229
I know me.

139
00:10:31.264 --> 00:10:34.534
If I started anything like that,
I'd probably fall in love.


140
00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:36.534
I'd only want one.

141
00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:38.571
And then where would we be?

142
00:10:38.606 --> 00:10:40.590
Let's get the war over first...

143
00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:42.540
and then I'll think about it.

144
00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:46.512
That's what I'm afraid you'll do...
fall in love with someone you can't have.


145
00:10:46.547 --> 00:10:49.515
- Don't do it, Lucy. You'll only get hurt.
- Who, me?


146
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.350
Lucy, the languishing librarian?
Not a chance.


147
00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:56.378
If ever I fall in love, it'll be with a guy
who goes out at 9:00 to a nice, safe office...


148
00:10:57.223 --> 00:10:59.190
and comes back at 6:00.

149
00:10:59.225 --> 00:11:03.218
Not one of these flyers...
here today and gone tomorrow.


150
00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:29.687
Come in.

151
00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:33.715
Commander Montagu
and Lieutenant Acres, sir.


152
00:11:35.328 --> 00:11:37.330
- Sir Bernard.
- Nice to see you.


153
00:11:37.365 --> 00:11:39.297
- How are you?
- Well, thank you.


154
00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:41.834
My chief assistant, George Acres,
Sir Bernard Spilsbury.


155
00:11:41.869 --> 00:11:43.801
- How do you do?
- I'm honored to meet you, sir.


156
00:11:43.836 --> 00:11:47.840
I've always wanted to ever since I heard you
give evidence in the Shotgun Murders.


157
00:11:47.875 --> 00:11:50.110
- You were absolutely masterly.
- Thank you.


158
00:11:50.145 --> 00:11:52.310
Though, mind you,
for sheer brilliance...


159
00:11:52.345 --> 00:11:55.848
No doubt if you continue to charm Sir Bernard,
he'll give you his autograph later.


160
00:11:55.883 --> 00:11:57.850
- Meantime, may we get on?
- Yes, sir.


161
00:11:57.885 --> 00:11:59.852
- Thank you.
- Sit down.


162
00:11:59.887 --> 00:12:01.838
Thank you.

163
00:12:01.873 --> 00:12:03.754
Sir Bernard...

164
00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:07.793
may I ask you some rather odd questions
without explaining why I'm asking them?


165
00:12:07.828 --> 00:12:09.760
You may.

166
00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:13.264
Suppose I wanted
to put a dead body in the sea...


167
00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:16.802
let it float ashore and have it accepted
by the people who find it...


168
00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:20.306
as the victim of
an air crash at sea.

169
00:12:20.341 --> 00:12:24.299
What sort of body would I need?

170
00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:30.349
Do you want the body
to show any physical damage?


171
00:12:30.384 --> 00:12:32.817
No.

172
00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:36.845
- But to look as though he'd died by drowning.
- Yes.


173
00:12:37.623 --> 00:12:41.126
- Could he be wearing a Mae West?
- Yes.


174
00:12:41.161 --> 00:12:44.595
- How long in the water?
- Two, three days.


175
00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:48.623
It rather depends on
the information I get from you.


176
00:12:49.635 --> 00:12:52.638
I would say your best bet would be
someone who died of pneumonia.


177
00:12:52.673 --> 00:12:54.605
When somebody dies of pneumonia...

178
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:57.108
there's a certain amount
of fluid in the lungs.


179
00:12:57.143 --> 00:13:00.146
After a few days in the water,
it would be almost impossible...


180
00:13:00.181 --> 00:13:02.547
to say that he'd
not died of drowning.


181
00:13:02.582 --> 00:13:05.550
That is, unless one
had reason to be suspicious.


182
00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:08.621
You mean, if you were suspicious
you'd probably spot it?


183
00:13:08.656 --> 00:13:10.688
I would, if it came here.

184
00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:14.716
But I don't suppose
it <i>would</i> come here, would it?


185
00:13:16.395 --> 00:13:19.363
I don't want to ask
any awkward questions...


186
00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:22.401
but at what sort of place
might this body be found?


187
00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:25.269
Shall we say... Spain.

188
00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:27.306
You wouldn't have any trouble there.

189
00:13:27.341 --> 00:13:29.273
I don't think there's anyone in Spain...

190
00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:32.645
who would examine the body closely enough
to spot the sort of thing that I have in mind.


191
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.946
One other thing, Sir Bernard.

192
00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.984
If we had to keep the body
for a week or two...


193
00:13:38.019 --> 00:13:40.353
how would we stop it
from decomposing?


194
00:13:40.388 --> 00:13:42.320
Refrigeration.

195
00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:45.323
<i>And while it was</i>
<i>being transported?</i>


196
00:13:45.358 --> 00:13:49.351
I would suggest some sort of
airtight canister packed with dry ice.


197
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.095
Why dry ice?

198
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.834
It would melt and give off carbon dioxide
which would dispel the air.


199
00:13:54.869 --> 00:13:57.802
It's the oxygen in air
that causes decomposition.


200
00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:01.830
It would be possible to store a body
in a canister in this way for quite a while.


201
00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:05.509
Well, thank you very much.
That gives me a start.


202
00:14:05.544 --> 00:14:09.548
Sir Bernard, you won't mind if we
come back to you on some of these points?


203
00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:11.515
By all means.

204
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.517
Incidentally,
on this question of refrigeration...


205
00:14:13.552 --> 00:14:17.456
you'd better have a word with my man Adams,
the fellow who brought you in.


206
00:14:17.491 --> 00:14:19.423
He has all the facilities here...

207
00:14:19.458 --> 00:14:21.961
and I can arrange for him
to look after things for you.


208
00:14:21.996 --> 00:14:23.928
That would help a great deal.

209
00:14:23.963 --> 00:14:27.956
If I were in your place, I shouldn't be able
to resist asking what all this is about.


210
00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:31.702
Lieutenant Acres,
if you <i>were</i> in my place...


211
00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:34.740
you would have to remember
what we used to be told in the nursery.


212
00:14:34.775 --> 00:14:38.744
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies.
Go on, George.


213
00:14:38.779 --> 00:14:40.711
Good-bye.

214
00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:44.739
Thank you very much.

215
00:14:46.752 --> 00:14:48.986
Well, so far, so good.

216
00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:53.014
That part of it seems to be practical anyway,
provided we can get a body.


217
00:14:53.526 --> 00:14:56.562
Oh, any decent undertaker
will fix us up with a body.


218
00:14:56.597 --> 00:15:00.555
I don't think that's a problem.

219
00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:05.293
So that in essence, sir,
the idea is this:


220
00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:09.440
The body of a dead man,
dressed as an officer...


221
00:15:09.475 --> 00:15:12.978
will be put into the sea
from a submarine off the coast of Spain...


222
00:15:13.013 --> 00:15:15.279
near Huelva.

223
00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:18.282
On the body will be
top secret documents...


224
00:15:18.317 --> 00:15:22.310
or a letter suggesting
our main attack will be Greece...


225
00:15:22.688 --> 00:15:25.156
not Sicily.

226
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:27.158
The body will drift ashore.

227
00:15:27.193 --> 00:15:30.161
It will be picked up
and the papers found.


228
00:15:30.196 --> 00:15:33.199
The impression will be
that it is the body of an officer...


229
00:15:33.234 --> 00:15:35.166
who was traveling by plane...

230
00:15:35.201 --> 00:15:39.205
and was drowned
when his plane crashed into the sea.


231
00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.707
Hmm.

232
00:15:42.742 --> 00:15:45.710
- Why Huelva?
- Two reasons, sir.


233
00:15:45.745 --> 00:15:48.748
First, there are strong inshore currents...

234
00:15:48.783 --> 00:15:50.715
and a prevailing onshore wind...

235
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.718
which will almost certainly
carry the body ashore.


236
00:15:53.753 --> 00:15:57.746
Second, one of the sharpest German agents
in Spain operates in that district.


237
00:15:58.758 --> 00:16:02.751
But the beauty of the whole scheme, sir,
is that it involves only one man...


238
00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:05.162
and therefore might be possible...

239
00:16:05.197 --> 00:16:09.190
in the ridiculously
short time allowed us.


240
00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:13.304
May I have your views, sir?

241
00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:17.343
In over 30 years of intelligence work
I've never heard of anything like it.


242
00:16:17.378 --> 00:16:19.977
Neither have the Germans.

243
00:16:20.012 --> 00:16:24.005
It's the most outrageous, disgusting,
preposterous, not to say barbaric idea.


244
00:16:25.951 --> 00:16:27.918
But work out full details...

245
00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:30.956
and be on hand at the war cabinet offices
at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon.


246
00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:32.923
Thank you, sir.

247
00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:34.925
You'll need a code name.

248
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:38.953
You can have... Jumbo,
Trader, Wigwam...


249
00:16:38.998 --> 00:16:40.965
<i>Mincemeat, Jubilee...</i>

250
00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.993
With your permission, sir, Mincemeat.

251
00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:49.230
Operation Mincemeat.
Comments and criticisms. Admiral.


252
00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:52.676
Well, it's an ingenious idea,
of course.


253
00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:56.215
Up to now, I've thought of four major ways
where it could go wrong.


254
00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:58.315
Four?
I was going to say 40.


255
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.253
First, your body may not oblige
by drifting ashore.


256
00:17:02.288 --> 00:17:06.091
Next, it may simply be handed over
to the British consul for burial.


257
00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:08.594
<i>Next, even if the papers are examined...</i>

258
00:17:08.629 --> 00:17:10.561
<i>they may not leak to the Germans.</i>

259
00:17:10.596 --> 00:17:14.366
And finally, if they do leak to the Germans,
the Germans may guess they're a fake.


260
00:17:14.401 --> 00:17:16.333
That's all quite true, of course.

261
00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:18.836
There are ways
in which it can go wrong.


262
00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:22.074
But that is so of any operation of war,
and certainly any deception plan.


263
00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:25.077
- Dickie.
- I'm for the idea in principle.


264
00:17:25.112 --> 00:17:27.044
But why not the south of France?

265
00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.082
<i>Then you'd be sure that the Germans</i>
<i>would get the documents.</i>


266
00:17:30.117 --> 00:17:32.049
<i>After all, Spain is neutral.</i>

267
00:17:32.084 --> 00:17:35.087
Sir, perhaps you would allow Lt. Cmdr. Montagu,
who put forward the idea...


268
00:17:35.122 --> 00:17:37.089
to answer
Adm. Mountbatten's question.


269
00:17:37.124 --> 00:17:39.056
<i>Well, Montagu?</i>

270
00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:41.058
The reason for choosing Spain, sir...

271
00:17:41.093 --> 00:17:44.096
is that we don't want
the Germans themselves to get the body...


272
00:17:44.131 --> 00:17:46.697
because we don't want it
examined too closely.


273
00:17:46.732 --> 00:17:49.735
But forgive me, even if we could
get over these obvious snags...


274
00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.702
surely we're being far too ambitious.

275
00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:54.705
The man might be carrying letters
at a lower level...


276
00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.733
but you can't expect the Germans to swallow
fake letters from the vice chief to Gen. Alexander.


277
00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:02.893
<i>From their point of view,</i>
<i>it'd be altogether too good to be true.</i>


278
00:18:02.928 --> 00:18:06.241
Montagu, surely the first question
German intelligence will ask themselves...


279
00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:10.256
is why the letter wasn't sent
through the normal channels...


280
00:18:10.291 --> 00:18:12.625
instead of by this...
this dead gentleman.


281
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.592
It was my intention, sir...

282
00:18:14.627 --> 00:18:18.620
to ask for a letter of a personal and private type
from you to General Alexander.


283
00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:22.766
It might contain
certain references to other people...


284
00:18:22.801 --> 00:18:25.604
which you would hardly want
to go through ordinary channels.


285
00:18:25.639 --> 00:18:28.407
You mean saying someone important
is a nitwit or something.


286
00:18:28.442 --> 00:18:30.374
Yes, sir.

287
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:34.402
There are, in fact, a number of jokes
already in circulation that might be suitable.


288
00:18:34.613 --> 00:18:37.115
Why is this officer flying to Africa?

289
00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.583
Where is he going?
What's his job?


290
00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:42.621
We'd like to make him a major
in the Royal Marines, sir...


291
00:18:42.656 --> 00:18:45.457
on your staff at Combined Operations.

292
00:18:45.492 --> 00:18:47.892
He's an expert on landing craft.

293
00:18:47.927 --> 00:18:49.929
You are lending him
to General Eisenhower...


294
00:18:49.964 --> 00:18:51.896
to whom he also carries a letter.

295
00:18:51.931 --> 00:18:54.400
- Oh, I write a letter as well?
- Yes, sir.


296
00:18:54.435 --> 00:18:56.367
He seems to have
jobs for all of us.

297
00:18:56.402 --> 00:18:59.405
Can my letter be rude about somebody too?

298
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.306
You realize that
if the Germans see through this...


299
00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:05.344
you're pinpointing Sicily
as the place where we <i>are</i> going.


300
00:19:05.379 --> 00:19:08.314
- Quite right.
- We've got a big agenda. We must get on.


301
00:19:08.349 --> 00:19:10.281
This is an imaginative plan...

302
00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:13.152
but obviously it needs careful consideration
or we may do more harm than good.


303
00:19:13.187 --> 00:19:16.120
<i>I think we'd better</i>
<i>leave it for the moment.</i>


304
00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:20.148
The time is very short, sir,
and we must get going as soon as possible.


305
00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.294
We're aware of that.

306
00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:26.297
We'll put it on the agenda
for the next meeting.


307
00:19:26.332 --> 00:19:29.300
<i>Attention!</i>

308
00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:32.338
I have a feeling it would be easier
to convince the Germans...


309
00:19:32.373 --> 00:19:34.305
than it is to persuade our masters.

310
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.343
It's no use losing your temper.
They've got a lot of other things to think about.


311
00:19:37.378 --> 00:19:40.346
Then why can't they make up their minds
and give us a plain yes or no?


312
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:42.313
They want to mull it over,
quite rightly.


313
00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:46.352
You'll just have to be patient. The moment
they agree, if they do, you can go ahead.


314
00:19:46.387 --> 00:19:50.345
Till then, you'll just have to wait.

315
00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:58.162
Sticky?

316
00:19:58.197 --> 00:20:01.200
Like trying to swim
through a barrel of syrup.


317
00:20:01.235 --> 00:20:04.220
They just want to stand
and chew their cud...


318
00:20:04.255 --> 00:20:07.171
and gaze into the distance
with big, brown eyes.


319
00:20:07.206 --> 00:20:10.209
What are we supposed to do,
get on with our knitting?


320
00:20:10.244 --> 00:20:13.212
I'll wager that in the end
they won't turn it down.


321
00:20:13.247 --> 00:20:16.215
I'm going to take a chance
and jump the gun.


322
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:18.182
You go and get a body.

323
00:20:18.217 --> 00:20:21.220
I'll start working out
drawings for a canister.


324
00:20:24.258 --> 00:20:26.690
Mosquitoes.

325
00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:29.728
One engine.
He'll be lucky if he makes it.


326
00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.212
- Larry.
- You all right?


327
00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.749
Port engine cracked up,
and Steve's had it.


328
00:20:50.784 --> 00:20:52.768
- Steve?
- Just outside Brussels.


329
00:20:52.803 --> 00:20:55.774
Light flak.
He went down fast.


330
00:20:55.809 --> 00:20:58.746
Didn't have time to bail out.

331
00:21:12.871 --> 00:21:15.374
Hello?
Hello?


332
00:21:15.409 --> 00:21:18.575
Joe?

333
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.613
I was on my way back.
I saw them come in.


334
00:21:21.648 --> 00:21:23.580
Are you all right, Joey?

335
00:21:23.615 --> 00:21:25.951
I'm all right, baby.
I'm fine.


336
00:21:25.986 --> 00:21:27.953
It was an easy one.

337
00:21:27.988 --> 00:21:30.122
Oh...

338
00:21:30.157 --> 00:21:33.203
I'm glad.

339
00:21:38.897 --> 00:21:41.365
- 4-3-9.
- Is Commander Montagu there?


340
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.403
- Yes, sir. He's here now, sir.
- Thank you.


341
00:21:44.438 --> 00:21:46.370
- Hello?
- Commander Montagu?


342
00:21:46.405 --> 00:21:48.907
- Yes?
- General Nye wants to talk to you.


343
00:21:48.942 --> 00:21:50.874
- Thank you.
- Montagu?


344
00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:52.876
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.


345
00:21:52.911 --> 00:21:56.904
Montagu, I want you to be at 10 Downing Street
tomorrow morning at 10:30.


346
00:21:57.416 --> 00:21:59.383
Of course, sir.

347
00:21:59.418 --> 00:22:03.411
Tomorrow morning at 10:30.
I'll be there.


348
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.860
It's going up to the prime minister.

349
00:22:40.893 --> 00:22:42.860
- <i>And Nye...</i>
- Sir?


350
00:22:42.895 --> 00:22:46.888
<i>Anybody in his senses knows</i>
<i>we shall go through Sicily anyway...</i>


351
00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:51.236
<i>so we've got everything to gain</i>
<i>and nothing to lose.</i>


352
00:22:51.271 --> 00:22:53.238
<i>Let the plan be implemented!</i>

353
00:22:53.273 --> 00:22:55.205
Thank you, sir.

354
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.243
All right, Montagu,
you've got the all-clear.


355
00:22:58.278 --> 00:23:00.210
And your submarine's fixed.

356
00:23:00.245 --> 00:23:02.646
- Jewell is sailing in <i>Seraph</i> for Malta on Friday.
- Jewell?


357
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:06.185
He's the man who put Mark Clark ashore
in Africa and rescued General Giraud...


358
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:08.152
so you're in good hands.

359
00:23:08.187 --> 00:23:11.190
- Can you make it?
- I assure you, sir, we shall make it.


360
00:23:11.225 --> 00:23:15.183
Good.
Carry on.


361
00:23:16.528 --> 00:23:18.996
Yes, I'll hold on.

362
00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:22.868
George, it's on. We've got the right of way
from the old man himself.


363
00:23:22.903 --> 00:23:26.050
"Let the plan be implemented!"

364
00:23:26.085 --> 00:23:29.197
I knew he wouldn't shoot it down.

365
00:23:29.374 --> 00:23:31.341
May I ask what you're up to?

366
00:23:31.376 --> 00:23:33.844
I've got a socking great blister
on my foot.


367
00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:36.882
I've walked more than 50 miles
in the last two days...


368
00:23:36.917 --> 00:23:38.849
I didn't go to
bed at all last night...

369
00:23:38.884 --> 00:23:41.386
and it doesn't matter whether
he shoots it down or not...


370
00:23:41.421 --> 00:23:43.388
because the whole thing
is utterly impracticable.


371
00:23:43.423 --> 00:23:45.390
- What?
- Napoo. Won't go. Not on.


372
00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:47.357
- Hello? Yes.
- Why not?


373
00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:50.360
Because, Monty, there simply
isn't any way of getting a body.


374
00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:53.899
You wave an airy hand and say, "George, go and
get a body," as though there was nothing to it.


375
00:23:53.934 --> 00:23:55.866
- Well, you try.
- Nonsense!


376
00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.868
There are hospitals,
nursing homes, mortuaries...


377
00:23:57.903 --> 00:24:00.906
- I've tried 'em! Not a hope.
- Is he at the hospital now?


378
00:24:00.941 --> 00:24:03.392
You see, Monty,
every body belongs to somebody...


379
00:24:03.427 --> 00:24:05.887
and it isn't a thing
people want messed about.


380
00:24:05.922 --> 00:24:08.312
What about the fellow
in St. Luke's Hospital?


381
00:24:08.347 --> 00:24:10.814
Changed his mind
at the last moment and recovered.


382
00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:13.852
- Very unreliable type.
- Yes, we'll come round immediately.


383
00:24:13.887 --> 00:24:16.320
- Have you tried Spilsbury?
- Yes, he gets bodies.


384
00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:18.857
But they're special ones that the police
think have been murdered...


385
00:24:18.892 --> 00:24:20.824
and he wants them himself.

386
00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:22.861
- Sir, I think I'm onto something.
- Where?


387
00:24:22.896 --> 00:24:24.828
In a small hospital
in St. John's Wood.


388
00:24:24.863 --> 00:24:28.856
I said you'd come and see the father.
There doesn't seem to be anybody else.


389
00:24:33.372 --> 00:24:35.540
- When did he die?
- 3:00 this morning.


390
00:24:35.575 --> 00:24:37.674
- Pneumonia?
- Bronchial pneumonia.


391
00:24:37.709 --> 00:24:40.177
Are there any other relatives
beside the father?


392
00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:43.715
I don't think so. He was an only child,
and I gather the wife's dead.


393
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.708
- Is the father with him now?
- He is waiting for you.


394
00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.187
You wait here.

395
00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:54.215
I think I'd rather
deal with this by myself.


396
00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:07.506
Perhaps you'd like to sit over there
while you're waiting.


397
00:25:07.541 --> 00:25:10.008
- Thank you.
- I'll come back in a few minutes.


398
00:25:10.043 --> 00:25:14.001
Right.

399
00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:23.021
It has been explained to you...

400
00:25:23.056 --> 00:25:25.155
that, for reasons of security...

401
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.193
we cannot tell you
why we are asking you this?


402
00:25:28.228 --> 00:25:31.161
Yes.
That has been explained.


403
00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:35.200
But if there is any question
you wish to ask me, sir...


404
00:25:35.235 --> 00:25:39.132
I will answer it if I can.

405
00:25:39.167 --> 00:25:43.030
I'll try not to embarrass you.

406
00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:49.548
Can you assure me,
Commander Montagu...


407
00:25:49.583 --> 00:25:52.234
as an officer and a gentleman...

408
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:54.851
that if I agree to your request...

409
00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:58.879
my son's body will be treated decently
and with respect?


410
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:02.359
I give you my word.

411
00:26:02.394 --> 00:26:06.098
His name will never be revealed?

412
00:26:06.133 --> 00:26:08.865
Never.

413
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.867
And finally...

414
00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:13.955
his body will have Christian burial?

415
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:17.008
I cannot absolutely promise that...

416
00:26:17.043 --> 00:26:21.001
but I am fairly certain of it.

417
00:26:23.014 --> 00:26:26.585
I was never the one...

418
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:29.553
nor was he...

419
00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:33.581
to mind very much about
the last resting place of the body...


420
00:26:34.659 --> 00:26:38.652
being more concerned
with the repose of the spirit.


421
00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:42.733
But still...

422
00:26:42.768 --> 00:26:46.772
I would like to be sure
that this thing you are going to do...


423
00:26:46.807 --> 00:26:49.573
is good...

424
00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:52.943
and worthy of him.

425
00:26:52.978 --> 00:26:55.278
I can assure you that...

426
00:26:55.313 --> 00:26:59.306
this is an opportunity for your son
to do a great thing for England.


427
00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:03.155
My son, sir, was a Scotsman...

428
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:07.148
and very proud of it.

429
00:27:07.492 --> 00:27:09.828
I beg your pardon.

430
00:27:09.863 --> 00:27:12.162
Never mind.

431
00:27:12.197 --> 00:27:14.164
We're used to that.

432
00:27:14.199 --> 00:27:18.192
You English always talk about England
when you mean Britain.


433
00:27:28.713 --> 00:27:32.706
Good-bye, son.

434
00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:36.488
I don't know what they want with you...

435
00:27:36.523 --> 00:27:40.358
but it doesn't matter now...

436
00:27:40.393 --> 00:27:42.659
because...

437
00:27:42.694 --> 00:27:45.563
you're not here anymore.

438
00:27:45.598 --> 00:27:48.433
You're somewhere else...

439
00:27:48.468 --> 00:27:52.426
and at peace.

440
00:28:02.481 --> 00:28:06.474
Good day to you.

441
00:28:06.718 --> 00:28:10.299
I have no son now...

442
00:28:10.334 --> 00:28:13.881
but you have a body.

443
00:28:28.874 --> 00:28:32.544
I think William Martin
is a good name.


444
00:28:32.579 --> 00:28:34.511
One naval identity card...

445
00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:38.083
in the name of
Captain, Acting Major, William Martin...


446
00:28:38.118 --> 00:28:40.050
Royal Marines.

447
00:28:40.085 --> 00:28:43.386
Born in Cardiff, 1907.

448
00:28:43.421 --> 00:28:47.414
I thought of Glasgow,
but I don't want to say he's a Scot.


449
00:28:47.626 --> 00:28:51.046
Also, a combined Operations Headquarters
pass in the same name.


450
00:28:51.081 --> 00:28:54.466
You'll need a photograph of him, sir,
for the identity card.


451
00:28:54.501 --> 00:28:56.433
So we shall.

452
00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:59.471
It's only a passport photograph.
It needn't look like him.


453
00:28:59.506 --> 00:29:02.407
Now, we need various articles
to go in his pockets...


454
00:29:02.442 --> 00:29:04.374
cigarettes, matches, bunch of keys...

455
00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:06.912
- What's he carrying the documents in?
- Briefcase.


456
00:29:06.947 --> 00:29:09.181
But he's floating in the water.

457
00:29:09.216 --> 00:29:11.381
Has he got it
in his hand, or what?

458
00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:14.384
What about one of those things
that bank messengers have?


459
00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:18.390
Goes around the waist, comes down
the sleeve and clips onto the briefcase.


460
00:29:18.425 --> 00:29:20.357
Get one, and we'll see.

461
00:29:20.392 --> 00:29:23.395
And he'll have to have
a wallet, money, wristwatch.


462
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:25.362
- George.
- Hmm?


463
00:29:25.397 --> 00:29:28.365
I think we're attacking this
the wrong way round.


464
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.670
Wallet, money, wristwatch,
they're all right and necessary.


465
00:29:31.705 --> 00:29:35.138
But, after all,
he must have had some private life.


466
00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:39.177
There ought to be something
more intimate on him when they find him.


467
00:29:39.212 --> 00:29:42.946
Personal things like photographs
or maybe some private letters.


468
00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:46.251
I'll tell you what. He'd better have
a girlfriend with a love letter from her.


469
00:29:46.286 --> 00:29:49.254
That's a good idea, but we'll have
to make it really convincing.


470
00:29:49.289 --> 00:29:52.322
Hmm.

471
00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:54.409
We'll get Pam to write it for us.

472
00:29:54.444 --> 00:29:56.426
You wouldn't mind, would you?

473
00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:58.964
<i>Would you have a go at it, Pam?</i>

474
00:29:58.999 --> 00:30:02.957
I'll do anything I can
to help with the work, sir.


475
00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:14.535
- Hang on a minute. I'll be back.
- <i>Okay, sir.</i>


476
00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:27.892
I won't come up, Lu.
There isn't time.


477
00:30:27.927 --> 00:30:30.860
All right.

478
00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:32.862
Good-bye, Joey.

479
00:30:32.897 --> 00:30:35.834
Now, remember, you're my girl now.
Official.


480
00:30:35.869 --> 00:30:39.827
I won't ever forget.

481
00:30:43.408 --> 00:30:45.375
<i>Victoria Station.</i>

482
00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.342
Hi, Pam.
How goes it?


483
00:31:17.377 --> 00:31:19.309
Little bit tired.

484
00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:21.311
Pam, I've got some news for you...

485
00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:24.098
and maybe it's going
to make you angry.


486
00:31:24.133 --> 00:31:26.851
Tell me later, Lucy,
when I've done this.


487
00:31:26.886 --> 00:31:28.818
Okay.
I'll go make some coffee.


488
00:31:28.853 --> 00:31:31.321
It's already done.
It's on the hot plate.


489
00:31:31.356 --> 00:31:34.359
That's what I like about you...
you're so inefficient.


490
00:31:34.394 --> 00:31:38.352
- You want some?
- No, thanks.


491
00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.700
"Dearest Willie"?

492
00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:46.738
Have you ever tried writing? That's the
greatest opening I've ever heard in my life.


493
00:31:46.773 --> 00:31:48.757
Don't fool.
It isn't a real letter.


494
00:31:48.792 --> 00:31:50.707
It's just something I've got to do.

495
00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:53.912
Love letters are always something
you've got to do. What's it for then?


496
00:31:53.947 --> 00:31:56.880
It's part of a story
I've got to make up.


497
00:31:56.915 --> 00:32:00.908
Well, let me help you. I'm completely
undiscovered and cheap. My work, I mean.


498
00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:03.655
- What's the story?
- Oh, it's very ordinary.


499
00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:05.622
They've just got engaged.

500
00:32:05.657 --> 00:32:08.159
He's going off on a dangerous job...

501
00:32:08.194 --> 00:32:10.161
and she's writing to him.

502
00:32:10.196 --> 00:32:12.128
Oh, that one.

503
00:32:12.163 --> 00:32:14.631
It's the start that's sticking me.

504
00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:17.902
"Dearest Willie... "
His name's Willie Martin.


505
00:32:17.937 --> 00:32:20.422
"It was lovely seeing you. "

506
00:32:20.457 --> 00:32:22.907
Willie Martin.
What a name.


507
00:32:22.942 --> 00:32:26.900
"Dearest Willie. "

508
00:32:29.514 --> 00:32:33.507
Take dictation.

509
00:32:37.889 --> 00:32:40.557
Darling...

510
00:32:40.592 --> 00:32:43.061
when you went away tonight...

511
00:32:43.096 --> 00:32:46.229
something went with you.

512
00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:49.734
<i>I think it must have been my heart...</i>

513
00:32:49.769 --> 00:32:53.727
<i>because now I'm cold and empty.</i>

514
00:32:54.205 --> 00:32:57.375
It's always bad when you go away...

515
00:32:57.410 --> 00:33:00.507
but it was worse tonight...

516
00:33:00.542 --> 00:33:03.604
because the day was so good.

517
00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:06.918
You shouldn't have bought the ring...

518
00:33:06.953 --> 00:33:09.452
and I knew you shouldn't.

519
00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:12.924
And you did because you love me...

520
00:33:12.959 --> 00:33:16.326
and I let you because I love you.

521
00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:20.354
There isn't much more than that
to be had from any day.


522
00:33:21.065 --> 00:33:23.067
<i>I won't wear it, darling.</i>

523
00:33:23.102 --> 00:33:25.554
I told you I wouldn't.

524
00:33:25.589 --> 00:33:27.971
Because if I did...

525
00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:30.508
that would mean that you were real...

526
00:33:30.543 --> 00:33:32.475
that you belonged to me...

527
00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:35.914
and that they couldn't
take you away from me...


528
00:33:35.949 --> 00:33:39.015
whereas now they can send you away...

529
00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:43.043
and leave me to wonder
if I'll ever see you again...


530
00:33:43.488 --> 00:33:46.491
or whether I may wake up...

531
00:33:46.526 --> 00:33:49.494
and find I'd dreamed you.

532
00:33:51.729 --> 00:33:55.082
Maybe there'll be a time
when it's all over...


533
00:33:55.117 --> 00:33:58.294
and you're still there
and real and lovely.


534
00:33:58.329 --> 00:34:01.472
Then I'll put your ring on
and wear it...


535
00:34:01.507 --> 00:34:05.465
and wear it until I die.

536
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:09.703
Oh, God, darling,
take care of yourself.


537
00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:14.285
As if you ever could or would.

538
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.086
I suppose I mean...

539
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:20.124
O God, take care of you.

540
00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:23.406
I love you.

541
00:34:23.441 --> 00:34:26.653
I love you.

542
00:35:02.901 --> 00:35:04.903
This is really wonderful, Pam.

543
00:35:04.938 --> 00:35:06.870
I had no idea you were a writer.

544
00:35:06.905 --> 00:35:09.372
- I'm afraid I didn't do it, sir.
- Oh?


545
00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:12.911
A friend of mine did it.
I only altered a word here and there.


546
00:35:12.946 --> 00:35:14.878
That's why I've signed it Lucy.

547
00:35:14.913 --> 00:35:17.415
- You didn't tell her anything.
- Of course not.


548
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:19.918
- She did it just for fun?
- Yes, sir.


549
00:35:19.953 --> 00:35:21.885
- Just for fun.
- Good.


550
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.387
- Oh, George, have you seen this?
- Yes.


551
00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:27.425
- I always told you there were hidden depths.
- Mr. Acres, I have...


552
00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.393
Never mind, my dear.
It happens to the nicest people.


553
00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:34.265
Oh, by the way, I fixed the letter
from the bank about Willie's overdraft.


554
00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.232
The manager was very helpful.

555
00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:38.534
- I told him just enough.
- Fine.


556
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:42.073
Tell me, does this alleged girlfriend of yours
wear thick spectacles?


557
00:35:42.108 --> 00:35:44.040
No.

558
00:35:44.075 --> 00:35:46.542
- Reasonably good to look at?
- Very.


559
00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:49.245
Ah, then we want her photograph
for Willie's wallet.


560
00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.273
- It doesn't have to be her photograph.
- <i>Oh, don't spoil it, Monty.</i>


561
00:35:53.351 --> 00:35:57.344
I want to see
this passionate Lucy creature.


562
00:35:57.789 --> 00:35:59.756
<i>What are you doing?</i>

563
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:03.784
It's got to look as though
it's been in his pocket for several days.


564
00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:07.265
Can we get a snap of this girl?

565
00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.267
- I should think so, sir.
- Good.


566
00:36:09.302 --> 00:36:11.234
Now about dates.

567
00:36:11.269 --> 00:36:14.737
There's got to be something on him
that will show when he left.


568
00:36:14.772 --> 00:36:18.576
I think I can fix to get a receipted bill
from the Naval and Military Club.


569
00:36:18.611 --> 00:36:20.543
He stayed there on his last night.

570
00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:23.080
And he went to the theater.
Final celebration.


571
00:36:23.115 --> 00:36:25.867
He has the stubs of the tickets
in his pocket.


572
00:36:25.902 --> 00:36:28.619
Item: Two theater tickets
for the night of...


573
00:36:28.654 --> 00:36:30.586
April 22.

574
00:36:30.621 --> 00:36:32.623
- Dress circle.
- Make it four.


575
00:36:32.658 --> 00:36:34.590
And for something worth seeing.

576
00:36:34.625 --> 00:36:37.593
And what's going on
in that bright little mind?


577
00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:40.631
You've got to buy the tickets anyway,
and Willie can't use them.


578
00:36:40.666 --> 00:36:42.598
We might as well.

579
00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:45.636
There are three of us already,
and with Pam's alleged girlfriend...


580
00:36:45.671 --> 00:36:47.638
I understand, dear chap.
Mmm.


581
00:36:47.673 --> 00:36:51.631
Make it four.

582
00:36:52.643 --> 00:36:55.611
I've hacked it about a bit,
as we agreed.


583
00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:59.650
It now reads, "General,
the Honorable Sir Harold R.O.G. Alexander.


584
00:36:59.685 --> 00:37:02.986
"My dear Alex, I am taking advantage
of this opportunity...


585
00:37:03.021 --> 00:37:06.491
"to send you a personal letter
by hand of one of Mountbatten's officers...


586
00:37:06.526 --> 00:37:09.961
to put you in the picture regarding
our intention in the Mediterranean. "


587
00:37:09.996 --> 00:37:12.795
- Good.
- <i>Then comes the personal stuff.</i>


588
00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:16.823
Then, "The plan is that the 5th
and 56th divisions will be reinforced...


589
00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:20.571
and form the main force
for the attack on Greece. "


590
00:37:20.606 --> 00:37:23.391
Then a lot about possible landing points.

591
00:37:23.426 --> 00:37:26.142
Then,
"In the western Mediterranean...


592
00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:28.713
"the heavy bombardment
of Sicily will continue...


593
00:37:28.748 --> 00:37:31.249
"as it is necessary
to make the enemy think...


594
00:37:31.284 --> 00:37:33.716
that this island is still
our main objective. "


595
00:37:33.751 --> 00:37:37.488
- That's exactly right, sir.
- <i>And the rest as we had it before.</i>


596
00:37:37.523 --> 00:37:40.456
Well, here you are.
Let's hope it foxes them.


597
00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:43.226
- I won't touch it, sir, if you don't mind.
- Why?


598
00:37:43.261 --> 00:37:47.254
I want only two sets of fingerprints on it...
yours and your secretary's.


599
00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:51.758
- What do you want me to do with it then?
- Fold it, sir.


600
00:37:57.075 --> 00:38:01.068
As sharp folds as you can.

601
00:38:04.916 --> 00:38:08.909
Now put it in the envelope.

602
00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:13.925
Now, if you'll wrap a piece of paper
around it so that I can handle it...


603
00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:17.918
I'll take it out to your secretary
and get her to seal it.


604
00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:23.367
- Thank you, sir.
- Any more chores?


605
00:38:23.402 --> 00:38:25.501
No, thank you, sir.

606
00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:28.717
And thank you very much.

607
00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:47.523
Thank you.

608
00:38:47.558 --> 00:38:50.561
- Sorry I'm late. Got his clothes?
- It's there.


609
00:38:50.596 --> 00:38:54.554
- Good. Where's Adams?
- He's gone down.


610
00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:27.698
All ready, Mr. Adams?

611
00:39:27.733 --> 00:39:31.691
Yes, sir.

612
00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:08.061
Identity disks.

613
00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:14.234
Underwear.

614
00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:18.905
- Laundry marks fixed?
- Yes.


615
00:40:34.265 --> 00:40:38.258
Socks and shirt.

616
00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:42.106
- This is new.
- He just bought half a dozen at Gieve's.


617
00:40:42.141 --> 00:40:46.099
- I've got the bill to put in his pocket.
- Right.


618
00:41:03.728 --> 00:41:07.721
Collar and tie.

619
00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.413
Awkward doing this on somebody else.

620
00:41:22.448 --> 00:41:24.380
Let me, sir.

621
00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:26.382
Now the uniform.
Trousers.


622
00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:28.919
Things in the pockets first,
or after they're on him?


623
00:41:28.954 --> 00:41:32.912
After.

624
00:41:44.268 --> 00:41:47.104
Blouse.

625
00:41:47.139 --> 00:41:49.905
Shoes.

626
00:42:17.802 --> 00:42:19.902
Not bad.

627
00:42:19.937 --> 00:42:22.206
The crowns on his shoulders
look a bit new.


628
00:42:22.241 --> 00:42:24.440
<i>He's just been promoted.</i>

629
00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:27.722
<i>The marks are still there</i>
<i>where his captain's pips were.</i>


630
00:42:27.757 --> 00:42:30.970
<i>Right.</i>
<i>Get the Mae West and the trench coat.</i>


631
00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:50.490
Now the personal effects.

632
00:42:51.936 --> 00:42:55.171
- One wristwatch.
- Right.


633
00:42:55.206 --> 00:42:59.210
Wallet containing one five-pound note,
three one-pound notes...


634
00:42:59.245 --> 00:43:02.441
letter from bank manager
re overdraft...


635
00:43:02.476 --> 00:43:05.638
book of stamps,
photograph of fiancÃ©e.


636
00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:07.683
Correct.

637
00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:10.721
Ten shillings in loose change
to go in right-hand trouser pocket.


638
00:43:10.756 --> 00:43:13.491
Correct.

639
00:43:13.526 --> 00:43:16.227
Letter from fiancÃ©e
to go next to wallet.


640
00:43:16.262 --> 00:43:18.194
Correct.

641
00:43:18.229 --> 00:43:20.696
Bill for six shirts
from Gieve's, Piccadilly...


642
00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:23.234
and receipted bill for a room
at the Naval and Military.


643
00:43:23.269 --> 00:43:24.700
Correct.

644
00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:27.238
Two stubs of tickets
to the Prince of Wales Theater.


645
00:43:27.273 --> 00:43:28.537
Correct.

646
00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:31.575
Cigarettes, matches, bunch of keys.

647
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:33.542
Correct.

648
00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:37.570
Combined Operations pass and naval
identity card in cellophane container.


649
00:43:38.249 --> 00:43:40.216
- Correct.
- Briefcase.


650
00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:44.244
- I'll fasten the trench coat and Mae West, sir.
- Thank you, Adams.


651
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:49.660
Apart from the cover stuff
already in there...


652
00:43:49.695 --> 00:43:52.830
letter from General Nye
to General Alexander.


653
00:43:52.865 --> 00:43:54.797
Right.

654
00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:57.835
Letter to General Eisenhower
from Admiral Mountbatten.


655
00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:01.828
Right.

656
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:10.503
- Shouldn't he have the key?
- He already has one on his key ring.


657
00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:56.392
Well...

658
00:44:56.427 --> 00:45:00.420
I think Major Martin
is ready to go to war.


659
00:45:30.661 --> 00:45:34.654
10:00. We'll have to
keep up a steady average to make it.


660
00:45:34.999 --> 00:45:38.992
- Thank you, Adams.
- Thank you.


661
00:46:54.445 --> 00:46:58.438
Attention!

662
00:47:46.764 --> 00:47:49.767
If you can manage
the launching of the body...


663
00:47:49.802 --> 00:47:51.734
with only officers on deck, do so.

664
00:47:51.769 --> 00:47:53.736
The fewer people in the know
the better.


665
00:47:53.771 --> 00:47:57.764
Better all round.
Sailors are a superstitious lot.


666
00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.510
What's your cover story for the crew?

667
00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:05.538
I put it round that the canister contains
a special sort of secret weather-reporting buoy.


668
00:48:10.355 --> 00:48:13.789
Well, I think that's the lot.

669
00:48:13.824 --> 00:48:15.826
- And the very best of luck.
- Thank you.


670
00:48:15.861 --> 00:48:19.229
We'll try and do
a good job for you.

671
00:48:31.143 --> 00:48:35.101
Carry on, Number One.

672
00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:53.724
- Ah, there we are.
- No sherry, no whiskey, no gin, no rum.


673
00:49:53.759 --> 00:49:55.691
- Well, what's this?
- Egg flip.


674
00:49:55.726 --> 00:49:57.978
I think my alleged friend
wants a light.


675
00:49:58.013 --> 00:50:00.195
Why am I always
your "alleged" friend?


676
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:03.233
- George has never been quite sure you exist.
- Oh, I exist, all right.


677
00:50:03.268 --> 00:50:06.236
- That's about all I do.
- There's no doubt about that.


678
00:50:06.271 --> 00:50:08.203
This is very interesting.

679
00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:11.241
From his attitude in the office, one would
never suspect George was such a fast worker.


680
00:50:11.276 --> 00:50:13.709
You should see him
in the typist's office.


681
00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:16.211
George, I think
we ought to drink to the major.


682
00:50:16.246 --> 00:50:19.249
- Oh, we must.
- Yes. He's the chap who got us the seats.


683
00:50:19.284 --> 00:50:21.216
He couldn't come.

684
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:24.755
Well, I don't know the major, but I'm quite sure
he won't mind me drinking to his health.


685
00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:26.722
He's probably a grand boy.

686
00:50:26.757 --> 00:50:29.760
Let's drink the health of all the majors
and all the commanders...


687
00:50:29.795 --> 00:50:31.727
and all the lieutenants.

688
00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:35.299
The major. May he have
a safe and successful journey.


689
00:50:35.334 --> 00:50:39.292
- The major.
- The major.


690
00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:43.300
- Steady as you go.
- <i>Steady, sir. Course:2-7-2, sir.</i>


691
00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:51.508
All right, my beauties.

692
00:51:51.543 --> 00:51:55.501
Not long now.

693
00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:04.054
<i>Sixty feet.</i>

694
00:52:04.089 --> 00:52:07.424
<i>Fifty-five feet, sir.</i>

695
00:52:07.459 --> 00:52:10.895
<i>Fifty feet, sir.</i>

696
00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:14.296
<i>Forty-five feet.</i>

697
00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:16.333
- <i>Forty feet.</i>
- Okay, Sub. Get going.


698
00:52:16.368 --> 00:52:18.335
- Aye-aye, sir.
- <i>Thirty-five feet, sir.</i>


699
00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:20.302
Up periscope.

700
00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:23.305
<i>Thirty feet.</i>

701
00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:27.333
<i>Twenty-five feet, sir.</i>

702
00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:45.918
Blast those fishermen.
Haven't they got any homes?


703
00:52:46.263 --> 00:52:49.064
Down periscope.
Stand by to surface.


704
00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:52.102
<i>Check main vents.</i>
<i>Open all L.P. Master blowers.</i>


705
00:52:52.137 --> 00:52:56.095
<i>Check main vents.</i>
<i>Open all L.P. Master blowers.</i>


706
00:53:25.535 --> 00:53:27.537
<i>Canister party on casing.</i>

707
00:53:27.572 --> 00:53:31.406
Tackle!

708
00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:33.744
- Hooked up!
- Take the weight!


709
00:53:33.779 --> 00:53:36.211
Steady.

710
00:53:36.246 --> 00:53:40.239
Steady does it.

711
00:53:44.087 --> 00:53:47.668
<i>Back down.</i>

712
00:53:47.703 --> 00:53:51.250
<i>Right up.</i>

713
00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:18.277
Boats.
Dinghy first.


714
00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:24.287
Unto Almighty God we commend the soul
of this, our brother departed...


715
00:55:24.322 --> 00:55:26.721
and we commit his body to the deep.

716
00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:30.321
The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away.


717
00:55:30.356 --> 00:55:33.886
- Blessed be the name of the Lord.
- Amen.


718
00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:56.075
All right, chaps.
Come on.


719
00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:03.627
Canister party back on casing.

720
00:56:03.662 --> 00:56:07.620
Canister party on casing.

721
00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:22.401
All right.
Down below.


722
00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:19.587
- <i>Â¿Es inglÃ©s?</i>
- <i>SÃ­, seÃ±or.</i>


723
00:59:19.622 --> 00:59:22.157
<i>Entonces creo lo mejor</i>
<i>hacerme cargo de aquello.</i>


724
00:59:22.192 --> 00:59:26.185
<i>Eso es imposible, seÃ±or.</i>
<i>Primero ha de ser reconocido oficialmente.</i>


725
01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:03.900
- 9-8-7.
- Yes.


726
01:00:03.935 --> 01:00:05.867
- Montagu?
- Yes.


727
01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:09.895
This is D.N.I.
Scramble, will you?


728
01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:16.335
I've got a bit of news for you.
The major's arrived.


729
01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:19.447
I've just received a signal.

730
01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:22.083
The vice-counsel at Huelva
is very worried.


731
01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:25.555
He says the body carried
what looked like an official briefcase...


732
01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:28.392
and he's pulling every string
to retrieve it.


733
01:00:28.427 --> 01:00:31.159
Let's hope he doesn't
pull too hard, sir.


734
01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:35.187
Yes. But I think it might help
to keep the ball rolling if I make a signal...


735
01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:38.233
telling him to get hold
of it at all costs.

736
01:00:38.268 --> 01:00:41.337
If it was genuine, that would be
the natural thing to do, wouldn't it?


737
01:00:41.372 --> 01:00:43.304
Good.

738
01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:47.332
Meantime,
I'll put Major Martin in the casualty lists.


739
01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:51.112
- That's the first thing they'll check.
- Right.


740
01:00:59.422 --> 01:01:02.275
<i>Amen.</i>

741
01:01:05.163 --> 01:01:07.197
Amen.

742
01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.601
Amen.

743
01:01:34.591 --> 01:01:37.443
I called on the magistrate
before the funeral.


744
01:01:37.478 --> 01:01:40.589
All Major Martin's belongings
have been returned.


745
01:01:40.624 --> 01:01:43.700
- And the briefcase?
- Yes, and the briefcase.


746
01:01:43.735 --> 01:01:47.693
Good.

747
01:01:49.506 --> 01:01:52.040
<i>Well, that's a bit of a blow.</i>

748
01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:55.311
<i>Either Lawrence was too efficient</i>
<i>or the Nazis were too dumb.</i>


749
01:01:55.346 --> 01:01:57.412
The lazy, incompetent beggars.

750
01:01:57.447 --> 01:02:00.516
Doesn't anything ever penetrate
those Prussian skulls?


751
01:02:00.551 --> 01:02:03.586
The net result
of Operation Mincemeat so far...


752
01:02:03.621 --> 01:02:06.039
seems to be that
we've lost two bob.


753
01:02:06.074 --> 01:02:08.423
Everything else is horribly intact.

754
01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:11.744
Of course, sir,
there are ways of opening letters...


755
01:02:11.779 --> 01:02:15.031
apart from using a knife
with marmalade on it...


756
01:02:15.066 --> 01:02:19.024
and ways of closing them again.

757
01:02:19.802 --> 01:02:23.373
I'd like to hear
what the scientific boys have to say.


758
01:02:23.408 --> 01:02:27.366
Agreed.

759
01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:36.853
- Well?
- Course, this has been in water.


760
01:02:36.888 --> 01:02:40.846
Yes?

761
01:03:15.825 --> 01:03:17.859
- Seawater.
- Yes.


762
01:03:17.894 --> 01:03:21.197
It makes it very difficult when things
have been in water, particularly seawater.


763
01:03:21.232 --> 01:03:24.232
- Well, can you tell us anything?
- I'm afraid very little.


764
01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:28.260
You see, when the thing's been in water,
seawater, it obscures so much.


765
01:03:28.338 --> 01:03:30.974
- But do you think it's been opened?
- Opened?


766
01:03:31.009 --> 01:03:32.226
Oh, yes, it's been opened.

767
01:03:32.261 --> 01:03:33.443
Oh, yes, it's been opened.

768
01:03:33.478 --> 01:03:34.909
It has been opened?

769
01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:37.312
And closed again by somebody
who knows his business.


770
01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:41.117
It's been stretched out on a flat surface
and held lightly at the corners...


771
01:03:41.152 --> 01:03:43.151
probably to be photographed.

772
01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:46.022
- I only wish I could be more helpful.
- You've done splendidly.


773
01:03:46.057 --> 01:03:48.389
That's all we had to know.
Well?


774
01:03:48.424 --> 01:03:52.417
- Mincemeat swallowed whole.
- Mincemeat?


775
01:04:11.547 --> 01:04:13.014
Well?

776
01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:15.350
There's nothing new
from Madrid, Herr Admiral.


777
01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:18.021
The fÃ¼hrer has told his conference
that the documents...


778
01:04:18.056 --> 01:04:20.054
are undoubtedly genuine.

779
01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:23.008
- You mean he doesn't doubt them.
- He's quite sure.


780
01:04:23.043 --> 01:04:25.893
The fÃ¼hrer, of course,
has certain advantages...


781
01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:29.499
over mere intelligence officers
like you and me, Frederik.


782
01:04:29.534 --> 01:04:31.899
He has his intuition...

783
01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:35.203
whereas we have to
rely on our brains.


784
01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:39.231
- And he's sure God is on his side.
- But you are not?


785
01:04:39.475 --> 01:04:42.745
I do not believe
that God is on my side to the extent...


786
01:04:42.780 --> 01:04:46.047
of handing me the enemy's plans.

787
01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:50.075
There's no way in which we can check
the genuineness of these papers.


788
01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:58.350
<i>Those certainly appear to be</i>
<i>Nye's and Mountbatten's signatures.</i>


789
01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:06.291
The question is whether
what is in the letters is true.


790
01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.897
And only the people
who wrote them could tell us.


791
01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:14.175
But we can do something...

792
01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:16.879
to check the genuineness of the bearer.

793
01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:18.980
In what sense, Herr Admiral?

794
01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:23.008
We know a great deal about
the lamented Major Martin, Frederik.


795
01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:27.446
We know the address
of his club, of his bank.


796
01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.658
We even know about his debts.

797
01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:34.686
I think someone had better ask
a few discreet questions in London...


798
01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:38.401
just to make sure
there was such a man.


799
01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:55.151
- From Dublin, Mr. O'Reilly?
- That's right.


800
01:05:55.186 --> 01:05:57.220
- How long are you staying?
- Uh, three days.


801
01:05:57.255 --> 01:05:59.389
- London?
- Yeah.


802
01:05:59.424 --> 01:06:01.489
- Business?
- Yes.


803
01:06:01.524 --> 01:06:05.517
- All right. Thank you.
- Thank you.


804
01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:16.204
- Is this all your luggage?
- Uh, yes.


805
01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:18.808
- Will you read this notice, please?
- I have.


806
01:06:18.843 --> 01:06:21.377
- Have you any articles subject to duty?
- No.


807
01:06:21.412 --> 01:06:25.370
All right.
I'll open this one up.


808
01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:31.576
All right. Thank you.
Shut it up again.


809
01:06:32.722 --> 01:06:35.558
Is this all your luggage, madam?

810
01:06:35.593 --> 01:06:38.359
Will you read this notice, please?

811
01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:42.387
Do you have any articles
subject to duty?


812
01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:05.955
Will you drive me to Number 57
Landsmere Gardens, please?


813
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:09.137
57 Landsmere Gardens?

814
01:07:09.172 --> 01:07:12.284
All right. Step in.

815
01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:25.341
I trust you had a pleasant journey.

816
01:07:25.376 --> 01:07:28.277
I am here with thee and thy goats.

817
01:07:28.312 --> 01:07:30.311
- Where from?
- Dublin.


818
01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:33.549
If you look over your head,
you'll see a plate with a telephone number.


819
01:07:33.584 --> 01:07:37.542
Memorize it,
but don't write it down.


820
01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:40.788
If it's absolutely necessary,
but not otherwise...


821
01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:43.392
ring that number for a cab to pick you up
outside the south entrance...


822
01:07:43.427 --> 01:07:45.728
to the tube station at Hyde Park Corner.

823
01:07:45.763 --> 01:07:47.895
Go straight there and wait for me.

824
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:50.950
But don't ring unless it's important.
You're not under my orders.


825
01:07:50.985 --> 01:07:53.935
I'm not responsible for you,
and I have troubles enough of my own.


826
01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:57.206
My instructions simply are to meet you
and deliver you and your luggage. That's all.


827
01:07:57.241 --> 01:08:00.575
I doubt if I shall bother you much.

828
01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:04.603
It's nothing to do with me,
but why were you chosen for this job?


829
01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:09.674
Because I'm so fond of the English.

830
01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:14.218
Yes, they are a loveable people.

831
01:08:14.253 --> 01:08:17.616
<i>Hey!</i>

832
01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:31.639
Your other bag, sir.

833
01:08:31.674 --> 01:08:35.678
- Thank you.
- Three and sixpence on the clock, sir.


834
01:08:35.713 --> 01:08:39.671
Thank you, sir.
Jolly good luck, sir.


835
01:08:52.595 --> 01:08:54.330
- Uh, yes?
- My name's O'Reilly.


836
01:08:54.365 --> 01:08:56.030
I believe you have a room for me.

837
01:08:56.065 --> 01:08:58.599
- Oh, you're the gentleman from Dublin?
- That's right.


838
01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:02.627
- Oh, yes. Of course. Will you come in, please?
- Thank you.


839
01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:08.744
Well, I'll take you straight up, shall I?
Give me one of your cases.


840
01:09:08.779 --> 01:09:10.711
Oh, I can manage.

841
01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:13.983
- Never let it be said I let a lady carry for me.
- Oh, you're all the same.


842
01:09:14.018 --> 01:09:16.719
I always say there's
nobody like the Irish for manners.


843
01:09:16.754 --> 01:09:19.086
My granddad was Irish.
He came from the north.


844
01:09:19.121 --> 01:09:21.840
But as he said,
"What does it matter, north or south?


845
01:09:21.875 --> 01:09:24.525
We're all Irish,
and all the Irish are kings' sons. "


846
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.175
Now, look,
I've put you on the first floor here.


847
01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:31.790
That's the bathroom and the necessary,
and this is your room.


848
01:09:33.736 --> 01:09:37.729
I do hope you'll be comfortable.

849
01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:41.844
I expect you'd like a cup of tea, wouldn't you?
I can make you one quite easily.


850
01:09:41.879 --> 01:09:45.546
Oh, no, thank you.
I'll just get on and unpack my things.


851
01:09:45.581 --> 01:09:48.884
<i>Oh, the blackout. Oh, you will be careful</i>
<i>about the blackout, won't you?</i>


852
01:09:48.919 --> 01:09:52.855
Do you know I had the police
round three times about it last week?


853
01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:56.025
Oh, don't worry.
I'll be very careful.


854
01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:59.161
Well, I'll leave you to yourself now.

855
01:09:59.196 --> 01:10:01.128
Oh, I almost forgot.

856
01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:05.156
In case you should want to be out late in the
evening, I'll put the key on the hall table.


857
01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:09.338
And if there's anything else you want, just call
"coo-ee" over the banisters and I'll pop up.


858
01:10:09.373 --> 01:10:13.331
Thank you.

859
01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:41.030
Polar... bear.

860
01:11:41.065 --> 01:11:44.495
Polar... bear.

861
01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:47.926
Stand by tonight.

862
01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:07.912
Well, the tie.
The darkish blue goes with this suit.


863
01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:12.561
Yes, with pinstripes
right through it, if we can.


864
01:12:12.596 --> 01:12:16.554
Thank you very much, sir.
Good morning.


865
01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.993
- Good morning, sir.
- Uh, um, I'd like some khaki shirts, please.


866
01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:25.474
- Made to measure or ready-made, sir?
- Ready-made.


867
01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:29.467
- Collar size?
- Sixteen.


868
01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:33.280
I think you'll like these, sir.

869
01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:35.850
They're very fine poplin.
Practically prewar quality.


870
01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:38.621
- Oh, yes, yes. They're very nice indeed.
- It's a beautiful shirt, sir.


871
01:12:38.656 --> 01:12:41.490
- But they're not really the ones I had in mind.
- No, sir?


872
01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:45.127
No, you sold some to a friend of mine
a few weeks ago.


873
01:12:45.162 --> 01:12:48.496
Um, Major William Martin
of the Royal Marines.


874
01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:52.524
- They were cotton with separate collars.
- I know the one you mean.


875
01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.540
Just take a look
at those, will you, sir?

876
01:12:57.575 --> 01:13:00.508
Separate collars. Cotton.

877
01:13:00.543 --> 01:13:02.545
- Oh, good morning, sir.
- Good morning.


878
01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:06.538
- Won't keep you a moment.
- Right.


879
01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:10.452
- Yes, these look like the ones.
- Good, sir.


880
01:13:10.487 --> 01:13:12.720
But I'm not quite sure.

881
01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:16.748
Uh, would it be troubling you too much
to look up Major Martin's account...


882
01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:19.360
Look, sir, if your friend
got his shirts from us...


883
01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:22.298
and if they were cotton with separate collars,
those are certainly the ones.


884
01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:25.833
- We haven't any others in stock.
- Oh.


885
01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:29.549
Well, I'll not doubt the word
of an honest man.


886
01:13:29.584 --> 01:13:33.231
- I'll take two.
- Thank you very much, sir.


887
01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:36.979
- <i>So I said to this chap, if you can't let us have...</i>
- Excuse me.


888
01:13:37.014 --> 01:13:40.333
- Is this the Naval and Military Club?
- Yes, that's right.


889
01:13:40.368 --> 01:13:43.652
- Thank you.
- Well, you might as well scrap the whole idea.


890
01:13:57.299 --> 01:14:01.292
I wonder if you could help me.

891
01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.909
I wonder if you could help me.

892
01:14:06.944 --> 01:14:08.876
I'll do my best, sir.

893
01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:11.914
I'm looking for a friend of mine,
Major Martin.


894
01:14:11.949 --> 01:14:15.751
Major William Martin
of the Royal Marines.


895
01:14:15.786 --> 01:14:17.952
I believe he's a member here.

896
01:14:17.987 --> 01:14:20.889
Do you happen to have seen him lately
or know his whereabouts?


897
01:14:20.924 --> 01:14:24.291
Major Martin.
There's a Major Martin who's a gunner, sir.


898
01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:28.297
No, that'd hardly be him.
He's in the Royal Marines.


899
01:14:28.332 --> 01:14:30.497
- Eh?
- The Royal Marines!


900
01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:33.102
I don't think I know
the gentleman personally, sir.


901
01:14:33.137 --> 01:14:35.521
Is he a regular officer or temporary?

902
01:14:35.556 --> 01:14:37.871
Oh, now, there I couldn't be sure.

903
01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:40.709
If he's a temporary,
I probably shouldn't know him, sir.


904
01:14:40.744 --> 01:14:44.046
There's a lot of members now
that I don't know.


905
01:14:44.081 --> 01:14:46.949
"Martin, Brigadier A.T."

906
01:14:46.984 --> 01:14:50.103
"Martin, Captain L."

907
01:14:50.138 --> 01:14:53.187
"Martin, Major W., R.A."

908
01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:56.992
No, sir. No Major Martin
what's a marine here, sir.


909
01:14:57.027 --> 01:15:00.728
- Now, surely that's odd if he's a member.
- Eh?


910
01:15:00.763 --> 01:15:04.698
- Surely that's odd if he's a member!
- Not necessarily, sir.


911
01:15:04.733 --> 01:15:08.726
What with the bomb damage and no staff,
we're a bit behind with things these days.


912
01:15:09.438 --> 01:15:12.539
If he's a new member,
he may not be on the file yet.


913
01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:16.312
You could leave a message. Then if he
comes in, I'll personally see he gets it.


914
01:15:16.347 --> 01:15:18.345
No, thanks.
It can wait.


915
01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:21.283
- I'm grateful to you, all the same.
- Eh?


916
01:15:21.318 --> 01:15:24.353
I'm grateful to ya, all the same!

917
01:15:24.388 --> 01:15:28.346
Oh. Thank you, sir.

918
01:15:40.002 --> 01:15:43.995
<i>This is the manager's secretary speaking.</i>
<i>Who is it, please? Thank you.</i>


919
01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:50.735
Will you hold on a moment, please?

920
01:15:57.619 --> 01:16:00.254
There's the contract you asked for.

921
01:16:00.289 --> 01:16:03.887
And there's a Mr. Phillips who'd
like to speak to you on the phone.


922
01:16:03.922 --> 01:16:07.485
- What does he want?
- He's making inquiries about a Major Martin.


923
01:16:08.497 --> 01:16:12.490
- About who?
- A Major Martin.


924
01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.271
Put him through.

925
01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:20.042
Stay on the line and get
a shorthand note of what we say.


926
01:16:20.077 --> 01:16:24.035
Yes, Mr. Emberton.

927
01:16:24.346 --> 01:16:26.313
Switchboard.

928
01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:28.882
- There's a call on my outside line.
- Yes, sir?


929
01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:32.910
- Get through to the exchange and have it traced.
- Yes, sir.


930
01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:39.495
- Hello.
- Is that the manager?


931
01:16:39.530 --> 01:16:42.796
Speaking.

932
01:16:42.831 --> 01:16:45.199
L
- I wonder if you could help me.

933
01:16:45.234 --> 01:16:49.227
My name is Phillips, and I'm making
some inquiries about Major William Martin.


934
01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:53.865
- Yes?
- I believe he was a customer of yours.


935
01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:57.913
Only the poor fellow's dead,
and as an old friend...


936
01:16:57.948 --> 01:17:00.482
I'm trying to help clear up his affairs.

937
01:17:00.517 --> 01:17:03.250
I see.

938
01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:07.278
I'm sure you'll understand it's an absolute rule
of the bank not to discuss a client's affairs...


939
01:17:07.423 --> 01:17:10.259
with anyone
but his accredited representatives.


940
01:17:10.294 --> 01:17:12.793
Certainly not on the telephone.

941
01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:15.362
But I am onto the right branch,
I take it.


942
01:17:15.397 --> 01:17:19.334
I should have thought the best thing
would be if you could drop in and see me.


943
01:17:19.369 --> 01:17:23.327
I'm pretty full up this morning,
but this afternoon's all right...


944
01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:28.232
if you'd like to come in at, say,
quarter past 2:00 and ask for me.


945
01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:32.781
Yes. Yes, I suppose
that would be a good idea.


946
01:17:32.816 --> 01:17:35.517
- A quarter past 2:00.
- Yes.


947
01:17:35.552 --> 01:17:39.510
All right.

948
01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:58.340
You were very smart
to get this, Mr. Emberton.


949
01:17:58.375 --> 01:18:01.076
My secretary often takes notes
of important calls.


950
01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:03.110
You say he had a slight accent?

951
01:18:03.145 --> 01:18:06.215
Yes, but, uh, not a foreign accent,
if you follow me.


952
01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:08.582
It's difficult to tell on the telephone.

953
01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:11.269
I should have said he was English,
but possibly from the west country.


954
01:18:11.304 --> 01:18:13.922
- Did you trace the call?
- It came from a public telephone booth.


955
01:18:13.957 --> 01:18:17.143
Obviously, yet when you
suggested an appointment, he agreed.


956
01:18:17.178 --> 01:18:20.205
He agreed, but he didn't sound
particularly enthusiastic.


957
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:23.197
Is there any chance
that this might be a coincidence?


958
01:18:23.232 --> 01:18:27.002
William Martin is quite a common name.
He may have just mistaken the bank.


959
01:18:27.037 --> 01:18:29.269
- It's possible, but...
- But not probable.


960
01:18:29.304 --> 01:18:32.975
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Emberton.
You've handled the whole thing beautifully.


961
01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:35.509
Frankly, I don't think
the man will turn up.


962
01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:39.281
However, we can't afford to take any chances.
We'll both be back at 2:00.


963
01:18:39.316 --> 01:18:43.285
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Thank you.


964
01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:46.119
- He's a good chap.
- Very good.


965
01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:50.147
Look, George, if there's somebody around
who can ring up Willie Martin's bank...


966
01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:54.218
it means that Jerryâ€™s putting the whole thing
under a microscope.


967
01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:58.523
Now, where, if anywhere,
is there a weak link?


968
01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:04.795
I'm going to Scotland Yard to talk
to General Colbourne of the special branch.


969
01:19:06.608 --> 01:19:09.611
Of course, a voice from a telephone booth
isn't much of a starting point.


970
01:19:09.646 --> 01:19:11.578
I realize that, sir.

971
01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:15.606
I wondered whether you'd had any ripple on
the waters recently that might give us a line.


972
01:19:16.285 --> 01:19:18.285
I don't think so.

973
01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:21.089
There's a gentleman just arrived from Sweden
we're rather interested in...


974
01:19:21.124 --> 01:19:23.590
but he's nothing to do
with your Major Martin.


975
01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:27.563
It's certain he won't come to the bank, but we'd
better have a couple of your men just in case.


976
01:19:27.598 --> 01:19:30.466
Yes, of course.
We must certainly be in on it.


977
01:19:30.501 --> 01:19:33.119
We always like to make
a new friend if we can.


978
01:19:33.154 --> 01:19:35.702
Besides, you may be wrong.
He may turn up.


979
01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:38.307
My guess is that he's only over here
for this one job.


980
01:19:38.342 --> 01:19:41.605
He knows we haven't
got our tabs on him.


981
01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:44.869
He's the sort of man
who might take chances.


982
01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:33.495
- <i>A washout.</i>
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>


983
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:36.465
- We'll get back and stand by.
- Right.


984
01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:39.366
Pity. Do you think
he suspected Emberton?


985
01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:43.394
I don't know, but it's obvious
he can't afford to show himself.


986
01:22:12.861 --> 01:22:15.597
- Hello?
- Is that the American Library?


987
01:22:15.632 --> 01:22:18.333
- Yes.
- Can I speak to Miss Sherwood, please?


988
01:22:18.368 --> 01:22:20.300
Just a moment.

989
01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:23.905
Lucy, it's for you, and you really must get him
to ring up out of working hours.


990
01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:26.575
I'm sorry. I'll tell him.
Hello? Hello, Joe?


991
01:22:26.610 --> 01:22:30.568
Lucy, this is Larry.

992
01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:35.706
- Hello, Larry.
- You know why I'm phoning, don't you, Lu?


993
01:22:36.017 --> 01:22:40.010
Sure. Sure.

994
01:22:43.825 --> 01:22:47.818
Oh, no, he's gone.
I guess I knew it would come.


995
01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:52.556
Thank you, Larry.
You all right?


996
01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:57.005
Yes, he was a good flyer.

997
01:22:57.040 --> 01:22:59.973
Thank you for ringing, Larry.

998
01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:04.001
<i>Would you check this book out,</i>
<i>please, miss?</i>


999
01:23:53.829 --> 01:23:57.076
<i>Lucy!</i>

1000
01:23:57.111 --> 01:24:00.324
<i>Lucy?</i>

1001
01:24:27.829 --> 01:24:31.031
Good evening.

1002
01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:35.059
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but the door was open.


1003
01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:37.537
Yes.
What do you want?


1004
01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:41.565
I'm making some inquiries
about a friend of mine, William Martin.


1005
01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:47.037
- William Martin?
- Yes.


1006
01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:51.375
- Yes, will you come in?
- Thank you.


1007
01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:59.693
Won't you sit down?

1008
01:24:59.728 --> 01:25:03.064
Willie's death was a great shock to me.

1009
01:25:03.099 --> 01:25:07.057
Yes, it was a great pity.

1010
01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:11.806
Forgive me, but I take it
you're not his fiancÃ©e.


1011
01:25:11.841 --> 01:25:14.307
No. I hardly knew him.

1012
01:25:14.342 --> 01:25:17.412
Only I understood
he'd just recently become engaged...


1013
01:25:17.447 --> 01:25:20.181
and that his fiancÃ©e
lived at this address.


1014
01:25:20.216 --> 01:25:22.148
That's why I came.

1015
01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:26.176
Yes, well, that's the girl who
lives here with me... Lucy Sherwood.


1016
01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:30.714
Oh, will you have a cigarette?

1017
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:38.222
Thank you.

1018
01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:42.304
Lucy Sherwood.
That's right. I remember.


1019
01:25:42.339 --> 01:25:46.297
I'll get you a light.

1020
01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:49.009
I should have liked to see her.

1021
01:25:49.044 --> 01:25:52.263
- I'm afraid she's out tonight.
- When will she be back?


1022
01:25:52.298 --> 01:25:55.542
Not until late, but if you could
come again tomorrow...


1023
01:25:55.577 --> 01:25:58.787
I'd say that you'd called
and that you'd be coming back.


1024
01:25:58.822 --> 01:26:02.780
Yes.

1025
01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:08.919
I knew Willie right from the time
when he was a boy in Cardiff.


1026
01:26:09.931 --> 01:26:12.500
Did he come from Cardiff?
I didn't know.


1027
01:26:12.535 --> 01:26:14.736
Is his fiancÃ©e very upset?

1028
01:26:14.771 --> 01:26:18.004
Well, naturally.

1029
01:26:18.039 --> 01:26:20.573
Well, I don't want
to take up your time...

1030
01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:23.476
but I do want to...
to do everything I can to help.


1031
01:26:23.511 --> 01:26:26.081
So if you would like to give his fiancÃ©e
my name and address...


1032
01:26:26.116 --> 01:26:29.783
- Your address?
- Yes.


1033
01:26:29.818 --> 01:26:33.811
Perhaps you'd care to take it down.

1034
01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:47.769
My name is Patrick O'Reilly.

1035
01:26:47.804 --> 01:26:51.671
R
- E
-I-double L
-Y.

1036
01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:55.699
And my address is

1037
01:26:56.478 --> 01:27:00.471
North West 1.

1038
01:27:01.649 --> 01:27:05.153
I am to be found there any time.

1039
01:27:05.188 --> 01:27:09.146
Right.

1040
01:27:16.031 --> 01:27:18.565
Oh. Sorry.

1041
01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:21.636
Don't mind me.
I'm just passing through.


1042
01:27:21.671 --> 01:27:24.105
You're Miss Lucy Sherwood?

1043
01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:26.306
That's right.

1044
01:27:26.341 --> 01:27:30.334
Well, go on. Where's your manners, Pam?
Introduce your handsome friend.


1045
01:27:30.412 --> 01:27:34.293
- Lucy, this is Mr. Patrick O'Reilly.
- Hello there.


1046
01:27:34.328 --> 01:27:38.175
Mr. O'Reilly is making inquiries
about Willie Martin.


1047
01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:40.353
Willie Martin?

1048
01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:44.381
Willie Martin.
Dearest Willie?


1049
01:27:44.459 --> 01:27:47.695
It's no good making inquiries
about him, mister.


1050
01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:51.688
Willie Martin doesn't exist.

1051
01:27:55.970 --> 01:27:59.963
At least he's dead,
which is the same thing.


1052
01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:03.272
That's right, isn't it?
That's true.


1053
01:28:03.307 --> 01:28:06.503
<i>He's dead, so he doesn't exist.</i>

1054
01:28:06.881 --> 01:28:10.874
It's the same with all these boys.
Here today, gone tomorrow.


1055
01:28:12.053 --> 01:28:14.087
What's real about that?

1056
01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:17.292
I was very sorry
to hear of his death.

1057
01:28:17.327 --> 01:28:20.026
Why should you be sorry?

1058
01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:23.164
You weren't in love
with him, were you?


1059
01:28:23.199 --> 01:28:26.267
He didn't give you a ring.
I never wore it.


1060
01:28:26.302 --> 01:28:29.102
<i>Now I never will.</i>

1061
01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:32.839
<i>Ever! Ever!</i>

1062
01:28:32.874 --> 01:28:36.867
- Lucy.
- I knew him in the old days in Cardiff.


1063
01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:41.271
Did you, now?
And I'll bet you knew his old man too.


1064
01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:45.342
His ma and his sister
and the whole shooting match.


1065
01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:49.422
Well, I didn't.
They were just photographs.


1066
01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:53.450
The usual photographs
with folks looking the way folks do.


1067
01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:56.463
But I never knew 'em.

1068
01:28:56.498 --> 01:28:59.945
In the time, I barely knew <i>him.</i>

1069
01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:03.393
Three months.
What sort of time's that?


1070
01:29:09.777 --> 01:29:13.770
And yet I knew him well enough.

1071
01:29:13.982 --> 01:29:16.551
And then they took him away from me...

1072
01:29:16.586 --> 01:29:19.955
and killed him in the sea.

1073
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:23.289
"Down, down into the sea...

1074
01:29:23.324 --> 01:29:25.827
to be lost evermore in the main. "

1075
01:29:25.862 --> 01:29:28.161
<i>Tennyson.</i>

1076
01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:30.265
<i>Do you know Tennyson?</i>

1077
01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:32.632
Why should you?

1078
01:29:32.667 --> 01:29:35.837
Why should I know Tennyson?

1079
01:29:35.872 --> 01:29:38.838
He almost made it.

1080
01:29:38.873 --> 01:29:42.610
Darling, I dreamed you.
I was always afraid I had.


1081
01:29:42.645 --> 01:29:45.345
Always afraid.

1082
01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.366
Lucy, darling,
I really think you ought to go to bed.


1083
01:29:48.401 --> 01:29:51.317
Bed? What for?
There's plenty of time to go to bed.


1084
01:29:51.352 --> 01:29:54.689
Years and years with nothing else to do
and nowhere else to go.


1085
01:29:54.724 --> 01:29:57.323
And everything cold and ended.

1086
01:29:57.358 --> 01:30:00.228
Oh, why can't you all go away
and let me alone?


1087
01:30:09.771 --> 01:30:12.540
- Is she all right?
- Yes, I think so.


1088
01:30:12.575 --> 01:30:15.276
But I really must get her to bed.

1089
01:30:15.311 --> 01:30:17.462
I'm sorry I've intruded.

1090
01:30:17.497 --> 01:30:19.614
You have my address.

1091
01:30:19.649 --> 01:30:23.607
Yes.

1092
01:30:27.323 --> 01:30:29.389
Lucy. Lucy.

1093
01:31:02.357 --> 01:31:05.226
Polar... bear.

1094
01:31:05.261 --> 01:31:08.513
Polar... bear.

1095
01:31:08.548 --> 01:31:11.766
Martin probably...

1096
01:31:11.801 --> 01:31:14.033
genuine...

1097
01:31:14.068 --> 01:31:17.588
but to be certain...

1098
01:31:17.623 --> 01:31:21.074
have deliberately...

1099
01:31:21.109 --> 01:31:25.102
revealed... my identity...

1100
01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:27.381
to enemy.

1101
01:31:27.416 --> 01:31:29.415
Stand by...

1102
01:31:29.450 --> 01:31:31.986
for confirmation...

1103
01:31:32.021 --> 01:31:35.221
in one hour.

1104
01:31:35.256 --> 01:31:39.060
<i>But if no message...</i>

1105
01:31:39.095 --> 01:31:42.664
<i>at that time...</i>

1106
01:31:42.699 --> 01:31:46.234
have been arrested...

1107
01:31:46.269 --> 01:31:49.249
therefore...

1108
01:31:49.284 --> 01:31:52.229
Martin false.

1109
01:32:34.582 --> 01:32:38.575
Come on.

1110
01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:43.791
- He had it all pat?
- Yes, about Cardiff and everything.


1111
01:32:43.826 --> 01:32:46.795
- Here's the address that he gave me.
- What's he like?


1112
01:32:46.830 --> 01:32:49.615
Tall, dark, Irish-sounding,
good-looking, about 30.


1113
01:32:49.650 --> 01:32:52.400
I'd like to get that description
to General Colbourne.


1114
01:32:52.435 --> 01:32:54.469
- May I use the phone?
- It's in there.


1115
01:32:54.504 --> 01:32:56.502
What chance that he believed you?

1116
01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:59.107
I don't know. I wasn't very good.
I wasn't ready for it.


1117
01:32:59.142 --> 01:33:01.944
- But he believed Lucy.
- You really think so?


1118
01:33:01.979 --> 01:33:04.711
Yes. He believed her, all right.
I saw his face.


1119
01:33:04.746 --> 01:33:08.739
- To Lucy it was true.
- For heaven's sake, don't start blubbering.


1120
01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:11.619
- How long did he stay?
- About 10 minutes.


1121
01:33:11.654 --> 01:33:13.986
I told him it was Lucy
that he wanted.


1122
01:33:14.021 --> 01:33:16.974
And you didn't get anything out of him
that would even give us a lead?


1123
01:33:17.009 --> 01:33:19.927
Now, steady, Monty. She got his name
and address. That wasn't too bad.


1124
01:33:19.962 --> 01:33:22.462
I didn't even have to get that.
He gave it to me.


1125
01:33:22.497 --> 01:33:25.233
General Colbourne wants us
to go round to this address and check.


1126
01:33:25.268 --> 01:33:27.535
- He's sending more men.
- Is there such an address?


1127
01:33:27.570 --> 01:33:28.735
Oh, yes.

1128
01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:32.440
It's a waste of time,
but I don't see what else we can do.


1129
01:33:32.475 --> 01:33:36.376
Don't worry.
It's all right.


1130
01:33:36.411 --> 01:33:39.180
- Leave one of your men to cover the apartment.
- Right then.


1131
01:33:39.215 --> 01:33:43.173
You lead.

1132
01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:37.870
- Good night, George.
- Cheerio, old boy.


1133
01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:41.898
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.
I beg your pardon.


1134
01:34:50.318 --> 01:34:53.754
Why should he bother
to give Pam a phony address?


1135
01:34:53.789 --> 01:34:56.389
Why? Why?

1136
01:34:56.424 --> 01:35:00.417
Unless... George, I'm off my head.
Stop the car.


1137
01:35:00.495 --> 01:35:02.930
No, get after French and stop him.

1138
01:35:02.965 --> 01:35:05.566
- Well, make up your mind.
- Hurry, man! Hurry!


1139
01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:15.510
Blow your horn, you idiot. 
Blow your horn.

1140
01:35:21.616 --> 01:35:25.609
Let's stop rushing around like buffalo
and use our brain, if we have any.


1141
01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:28.721
Aren't I working for you anymore?
What is all this?


1142
01:35:28.756 --> 01:35:31.357
- What's the matter, sir?
- French, we're making fools of ourselves.


1143
01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:34.295
I'm inclined to agree with you, but Colbourne
feels we shouldn't take any chances.


1144
01:35:34.330 --> 01:35:36.715
- He thinks he might be there.
- That's just the point.


1145
01:35:36.750 --> 01:35:39.065
- He is there. I'm certain of it.
- Shouldn't we get on?


1146
01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:41.786
French, I want you to take your men
to the house and cover it.


1147
01:35:41.821 --> 01:35:44.431
Don't be spotted and don't do
anything else until I tell you.


1148
01:35:44.466 --> 01:35:47.041
- And if our man comes out, sir?
- Don't worry about that.


1149
01:35:47.076 --> 01:35:49.008
I'm quite sure he won't.

1150
01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:51.911
Off you go, and, mind you,
no action without further orders.


1151
01:35:51.946 --> 01:35:54.582
- You don't want us to scoop him up?
- That's exactly what I mean.


1152
01:35:54.617 --> 01:35:56.782
I'm sorry, sir,
but my orders from General...


1153
01:35:56.817 --> 01:35:59.252
I don't give a damn what your orders are.
You do as I say.


1154
01:35:59.287 --> 01:36:02.490
- I'll talk to Gen. Colbourne.
- Thank you very much, Commander.


1155
01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:07.793
- French, you have my orders. Carry them out.
- Yes, sir.


1156
01:36:07.828 --> 01:36:11.821
Just a minute, sir. Before those orders go
through, will you listen for one moment?


1157
01:36:12.567 --> 01:36:15.101
Montagu, you're taking
too much upon yourself.


1158
01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:18.205
The man almost certainly isn't there,
but if he is, he won't be there for long.


1159
01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:20.792
- Every moment we waste...
- Sir, he is there.


1160
01:36:20.827 --> 01:36:23.309
Then why are you trying
to countermand my orders?


1161
01:36:23.344 --> 01:36:26.875
General Colbourne,
if you send your men to the house...


1162
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:30.407
you will arrest one spy,
and we may lose 30,000 men.


1163
01:36:30.484 --> 01:36:33.054
I ask you to send French
to cover the house and do no more...


1164
01:36:33.089 --> 01:36:35.688
until I've had a chance to explain.

1165
01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:39.716
- You're uncommonly sure of yourself.
- I'm sure of nothing, sir.


1166
01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:42.863
But I've used what few brains I have...

1167
01:36:42.898 --> 01:36:45.933
and now I must stand
by what they tell me.


1168
01:36:45.968 --> 01:36:48.367
Your decision, sir.

1169
01:36:48.402 --> 01:36:50.972
French, cover the house
and wait for further orders <i>from me.</i>


1170
01:36:51.007 --> 01:36:54.240
Yes, sir.

1171
01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:58.268
- Well, now, Commander?
- I'd prefer not to talk about it in the street, sir.


1172
01:37:43.257 --> 01:37:46.794
What I'm asking you to assume, sir, is...

1173
01:37:46.829 --> 01:37:48.761
that that address is genuine.

1174
01:37:48.796 --> 01:37:51.365
- If so, what happens?
- We pick him up.


1175
01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.418
Suppose he doesn't mind that?

1176
01:37:53.453 --> 01:37:55.401
People usually mind being shot.

1177
01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:59.305
Suppose he's prepared to risk his life
to be sure about Willie Martin.


1178
01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:03.177
If we turn up at that address,
it can only mean that we've been tipped off...


1179
01:38:03.212 --> 01:38:06.814
and that the whole
Martin story is a plant.


1180
01:38:06.849 --> 01:38:08.883
This man will have committed suicide...

1181
01:38:08.918 --> 01:38:11.336
but Jerry will know the answer...

1182
01:38:11.371 --> 01:38:13.719
and our operation will be blown.

1183
01:38:13.754 --> 01:38:17.623
I'm sorry, sir.
We mustn't touch him. We daren't.


1184
01:38:17.658 --> 01:38:20.227
You mean, till after we think
he's got a message through.


1185
01:38:20.262 --> 01:38:22.928
No, sir.
Right up till the time of the landings.


1186
01:38:22.963 --> 01:38:26.956
Because the fact that there have been no further
messages from him might give the game away.


1187
01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:29.770
You realize he'll probably be
out of the country in a couple of days.


1188
01:38:29.805 --> 01:38:32.307
Yes, and we must let him go.

1189
01:38:32.342 --> 01:38:34.809
After all, he's done us no harm.

1190
01:38:34.844 --> 01:38:37.176
Masterly inactivity.

1191
01:38:37.211 --> 01:38:41.204
They also serve
who only stand and wait.


1192
01:39:52.119 --> 01:39:55.222
