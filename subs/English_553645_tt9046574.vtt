1
00:00:57.075 --> 00:01:01.121
Robert Johnson is considered one
of the greatest blues artists of all time.


2
00:01:02.622 --> 00:01:06.084
There's just something sort of
supernatural about Robert.


3
00:01:06.543 --> 00:01:10.296
This is a level of genius
that maybe will only exist once.


4
00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:13.133
You can't hear a blues tune
or a rock tune that


5
00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:15.416
don't have some of Robert's
chords in it.


6
00:01:15.593 --> 00:01:17.971
You think you're hearing
two or three guys playing


7
00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:19.305
and it's just one guy.

8
00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:22.267
♪ I went to the crossroads ♪

9
00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:24.394
♪ Fell down on my knees ♪

10
00:01:24.477 --> 00:01:27.939
It's the template
for what became rock and roll.


11
00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:32.277
The songs and the subject matter,
let alone the guitar playing,


12
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.778
which is very much like Bach,

13
00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:35.822
and the voice is so eerie...

14
00:01:35.905 --> 00:01:38.575
♪ Save poor Bob if you please ♪

15
00:01:38.783 --> 00:01:41.953
You put that in a class by itself,
you know, and Johnson is.


16
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.205
♪ Standin' at the crossroads ♪

17
00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.791
Because there wasn't
that much known about Johnson,


18
00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:48.668
he came with mystery attached.

19
00:01:51.296 --> 00:01:54.340
The myth of Robert Johnson
still lives today,


20
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:58.720
because there was so many
unsolved mysteries.


21
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.139
The music drew us in,

22
00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:05.935
but it was the myth that made people
believe that there is magic out there.


23
00:02:06.686 --> 00:02:11.149
All of us have been trying to
figure out the mystery around the man.


24
00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.989
Robert was said to have been
a novice guitar player.


25
00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:19.616
Not very good.

26
00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:24.120
So he went away and came back
playing so good,


27
00:02:24.204 --> 00:02:26.581
that everybody says, "He did something."

28
00:02:27.874 --> 00:02:30.960
The legend is
he went to the crossroads,


29
00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:33.338
he met the devil there,

30
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:36.299
he sold his soul,

31
00:02:37.842 --> 00:02:40.929
and then he became
the greatest guitar player in the world.


32
00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:44.098
But how much is myth

33
00:02:44.474 --> 00:02:46.017
and how much is real?

34
00:02:58.196 --> 00:03:01.491
There's very little known about
the life of Robert Johnson.


35
00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:04.535
In fact, there are only two known photos.

36
00:03:06.204 --> 00:03:07.330
And no footage.

37
00:03:09.207 --> 00:03:10.833
I've spent the last 50 years...

38
00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.087
studying the life and music
of Robert Johnson.


39
00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.007
Robert Johnson had a very short
recording career.


40
00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:20.927
We only have 29 compositions.

41
00:03:21.552 --> 00:03:24.597
And he died so young,
at the age of 27.


42
00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.519
I first found out that
Robert Johnson was my grandfather


43
00:03:29.602 --> 00:03:32.188
when I was about 15 years old.

44
00:03:33.106 --> 00:03:35.525
When I first heard Robert Johnson,
I was like,


45
00:03:35.608 --> 00:03:37.986
"Okay, that's what music is."

46
00:03:38.987 --> 00:03:40.738
And there's so much
we don't know about him,


47
00:03:40.822 --> 00:03:42.949
so I read everything
I could get my hands on.


48
00:03:45.076 --> 00:03:48.162
I became a scholar of Johnson
by reading everything I possibly could,


49
00:03:48.246 --> 00:03:49.580
by listening to all his music,

50
00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:51.332
but also as a musician,

51
00:03:51.416 --> 00:03:54.168
I was trying to get inside and understand
what his state of mind was.


52
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.007
When I heard Robert Johnson,

53
00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.093
I said, "This is
the top of the tower,

54
00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:04.178
and I gotta figure out what that is."

55
00:04:04.262 --> 00:04:05.847
But it wasn't a conscious decision,

56
00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.100
it was just like, that's what I knew
I wanted to do.


57
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.728
I remember my grandfather saying,

58
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.771
"That old boy from the Delta,
Robert Johnson,


59
00:04:13.855 --> 00:04:15.106
always hung out at the graveyard."

60
00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.567
And then he started talking about,

61
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.652
"Him the devil, done this and done that."

62
00:04:19.736 --> 00:04:22.947
And it just brung a lot of curiousness
about this man.


63
00:04:24.365 --> 00:04:28.619
There was one cut by Robert Johnson
on this country blues record


64
00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:30.163
and it just stood out.

65
00:04:30.246 --> 00:04:33.875
So I made it a quest to find out
as much as I could about him.


66
00:04:37.003 --> 00:04:40.798
I made countless trips
to his hometown, Hazlehurst, Mississippi,


67
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:43.593
talking to everyone that I could find
who knew him.


68
00:04:44.093 --> 00:04:45.928
I would just drive until I saw

69
00:04:46.012 --> 00:04:49.932
somebody sitting on their porch outside
and I'd just pull up.


70
00:04:50.016 --> 00:04:53.478
And there'd just be so much information
that you could get


71
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:56.189
just by cold calling people, you know?

72
00:04:56.272 --> 00:04:58.733
Did you and Robert go together
for a while?


73
00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:01.402
I guess about six or seven months,
something like that.


74
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:04.947
Before he left and went somewhere
to make records.


75
00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:07.492
He said he's going to make...
make some records.


76
00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.536
It wasn't until 1967...

77
00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:15.124
that Robert's death certificate
was discovered.


78
00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:18.628
And with that discovery,
we learned who his mother was,


79
00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:20.380
we learned who is father was,

80
00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:24.258
and we learned the first real facts
about Robert Johnson.


81
00:05:24.592 --> 00:05:26.511
So, little by little,

82
00:05:26.594 --> 00:05:29.347
using census records, city directories,

83
00:05:30.056 --> 00:05:32.225
death certificates, marriage licenses...

84
00:05:32.308 --> 00:05:34.394
More and more information came out,

85
00:05:34.477 --> 00:05:36.938
and each time a piece of information
would come out,


86
00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:41.859
it would be like a new key that would
open up yet another door.


87
00:05:44.904 --> 00:05:46.781
Look at this!

88
00:05:46.864 --> 00:05:48.783
They said you were wearin' some orange.

89
00:05:50.827 --> 00:05:51.953

92
00:06:02.713 --> 00:06:06.759
My grandfather, Robert Johnson,
was born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi.


93
00:06:08.886 --> 00:06:10.638
His mother was Julia Dodds

94
00:06:10.721 --> 00:06:13.224
and she was married to Charles Dodds.

95
00:06:14.058 --> 00:06:17.311
Charles Dodds was a wealthy
carpenter and farmer.


96
00:06:18.187 --> 00:06:20.773
But some local white people
resented his success


97
00:06:20.857 --> 00:06:24.444
and he was forced to flee to Memphis
to escape a lynch mob.


98
00:06:25.695 --> 00:06:27.321
Julia was left destitute

99
00:06:27.405 --> 00:06:29.949
and took up with a local
lumber camp worker,


100
00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:32.660
who would become Robert's
biological father.


101
00:06:37.415 --> 00:06:38.791
This was the home...

102
00:06:41.794 --> 00:06:43.379
in all probability,

103
00:06:43.963 --> 00:06:46.340
where Robert Johnson was actually born.

104
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.925
Here it is,

105
00:06:49.927 --> 00:06:52.138
this beyond-modest place...

106
00:06:52.847 --> 00:06:55.349
...that somehow has persisted

107
00:06:56.392 --> 00:06:57.643
for more than a century.

108
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.521
The fact that it survives...

109
00:07:02.398 --> 00:07:04.567
it's kind of like a metaphor
for Robert's life.


110
00:07:10.323 --> 00:07:12.450
As far as my information goes,

111
00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:15.369
he was always pushed
from one house to another house,


112
00:07:15.453 --> 00:07:19.081
from Memphis to the Delta to Arkansas,

113
00:07:19.165 --> 00:07:22.293
and I think his mom even
walked out on him at one point.


114
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:26.714
So he never had a stable home
and a stable environment.


115
00:07:27.006 --> 00:07:30.551
He never had a father figure
that accepted him for who he was.


116
00:07:33.513 --> 00:07:35.014
Years went by,

117
00:07:35.097 --> 00:07:37.934
until eventually Robert Johnson's
mother remarried.


118
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:42.146
Robert moved in with his new stepfather,
a sharecropper.


119
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.816
I heard his stepfather used to abuse him.

120
00:07:46.275 --> 00:07:49.278
Because he didn't want to go work
in the fields, he would beat him.


121
00:07:49.987 --> 00:07:52.740
Johnson looked at his stepfather,
who was a sharecropper,


122
00:07:52.823 --> 00:07:54.450
and saw what a bad deal it was

123
00:07:54.784 --> 00:07:56.994
to get hooked up to
a plow and a boss,

124
00:07:57.078 --> 00:07:59.080
and said, "I'm gonna be free.
I'm not gonna do that.


125
00:07:59.163 --> 00:08:00.748
I'm not gonna get ripped off that way."

126
00:08:02.708 --> 00:08:06.587
But as a race, we didn't have
much to choose from as far as work goes.


127
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:08.506
It was the field

128
00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:10.341
or basically nothing.

129
00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.931
So, he wanted to make his living
with the blues.


130
00:08:17.515 --> 00:08:20.726
Long fingers, playing the guitar,
he didn't want to mess his fingers up.


131
00:08:22.186 --> 00:08:25.731
He'd come to the field
and play for somebody


132
00:08:25.815 --> 00:08:27.650
to make a nickel or dime, you know.

133
00:08:35.199 --> 00:08:37.868
The big deal was
Will Dockery's plantation.


134
00:08:38.536 --> 00:08:40.705
Outside of Robinsonville.

135
00:08:41.205 --> 00:08:42.832
People worked there all week long.

136
00:08:43.249 --> 00:08:44.542
No radios,

137
00:08:44.792 --> 00:08:46.043
no music, no entertainment.

138
00:08:46.794 --> 00:08:49.547
But, on the weekend,
the musicians came out.


139
00:08:50.089 --> 00:08:53.759
It served as a balm
for people who were in bondage.


140
00:08:54.218 --> 00:08:56.512
And it gave you a way out.

141
00:08:56.887 --> 00:08:59.974
You play that music,
you could be outside of yourself.


142
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.602
You know, you could
take everybody else out.


143
00:09:02.768 --> 00:09:04.562
You know, outside of their selves.

144
00:09:06.897 --> 00:09:10.026

145

♪ Believe I'll dust my broom ♪

146
00:09:16.115 --> 00:09:18.909
Most all these church folk,
you say, "Where the blues come from?"


147
00:09:18.993 --> 00:09:20.493
"It came from the church."

148
00:09:20.578 --> 00:09:21.877
But that's a lie.

149
00:09:22.663 --> 00:09:25.291
It didn't come from the church,
it came from the field.


150
00:09:28.419 --> 00:09:29.629
Out there in the field,

151
00:09:30.004 --> 00:09:31.589
they was playing instruments.

152
00:09:32.506 --> 00:09:33.633
Harmonica.

153
00:09:34.008 --> 00:09:35.968
"Oh baby" this and "oh baby" that.

154

♪ Somebody gonna hurt you, woman
Like you hurt me ♪


155
00:09:39.472 --> 00:09:41.432
Weren't even talking about the woman.

156
00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:43.515
Talking about the man he's working for.

157
00:09:44.268 --> 00:09:48.064
Nobody played the blues
like the Mississippi folks.


158
00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:50.775
Because it's something
that was in 'em already.


159
00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:53.986
The musicians would play
for the sharecroppers,


160
00:09:54.278 --> 00:09:56.489
but the sharecroppers
didn't have any money.


161
00:09:57.156 --> 00:09:58.783
But city folks did.

162
00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:04.664
So if you were a black musician
at that time,


163
00:10:04.747 --> 00:10:07.833
you strap a guitar to your back,
you stick your thumb out,


164
00:10:07.917 --> 00:10:10.252
and you just go from town to town.

165
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.881
You would travel by bus, train,
walking down the street.


166
00:10:13.964 --> 00:10:16.842
However you could get there, and perform

167
00:10:16.926 --> 00:10:17.968
anywhere you could.

168
00:10:18.427 --> 00:10:20.388
On a street corner, in a juke joint.

169
00:10:20.471 --> 00:10:22.390
Anywhere that there was an audience.

170
00:10:22.473 --> 00:10:25.226
If you're obsessed with remaining free
from the cotton fields,


171
00:10:25.768 --> 00:10:27.853
you gotta be able to play
what people want,


172
00:10:27.937 --> 00:10:29.897
so they played polkas, country music,

173
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.607
pop songs.

174
00:10:31.691 --> 00:10:34.694
Also, by setting up
on the sidewalk, the word would get out


175
00:10:34.777 --> 00:10:36.404
that these musicians were in town.

176
00:10:36.487 --> 00:10:39.532
The owner of a juke would get in touch
with them and say, "Well, you know,


177
00:10:39.615 --> 00:10:41.450
can you come and play
at my place tonight?"


178
00:10:46.872 --> 00:10:49.750
The juke joint was in city limits,

179
00:10:49.834 --> 00:10:52.795
where black peoples could go
and have a good time in town.


180
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:56.757
They would dance, play music,
drink beer, gamble.


181
00:10:57.174 --> 00:10:59.051
Just together, you know,
for the community.


182
00:11:03.264 --> 00:11:06.100
Robert would work a town
until he had it worked out...


183
00:11:07.601 --> 00:11:10.855
...and then just get back on the road
and go to the next town.


184
00:11:11.897 --> 00:11:15.359
Robert Johnson on the road
in his 20s, it was dangerous.


185
00:11:15.651 --> 00:11:17.194
It was extremely dangerous.

186
00:11:17.278 --> 00:11:18.279
For a black man,

187
00:11:18.362 --> 00:11:21.449
Mississippi was one of the most
dangerous places in the world.


188
00:11:26.203 --> 00:11:28.456
If you lived in the upper south
like the Virginias,


189
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:30.458
even the Carolinas,

190
00:11:30.541 --> 00:11:32.042
the master would threaten you.

191
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:35.588
"You don't act right,
I'm gonna send you down Mississippi.


192
00:11:35.921 --> 00:11:36.921
I'm gonna sell you."

193
00:11:36.922 --> 00:11:37.923
And people were like,

194
00:11:38.215 --> 00:11:39.550
"Whatever you do,

195
00:11:39.884 --> 00:11:41.802
please don't send me down there,"

196
00:11:41.886 --> 00:11:44.430
'cause they knew how badly
they treated people.


197
00:11:45.681 --> 00:11:47.433
You're a black person,
then you could be


198
00:11:47.516 --> 00:11:48.726
killed, lynched,

199
00:11:49.477 --> 00:11:50.603
just on a whim.

200
00:11:51.353 --> 00:11:52.980
"Boy, I don't like you.

201
00:11:53.063 --> 00:11:55.107
What do you say, fellas?
Come on, let's..."


202
00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:56.484
Yeah.

203
00:11:58.402 --> 00:12:01.447
There were more lynchings
in the Mississippi Delta


204
00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.948
than anyplace else.

205
00:12:04.408 --> 00:12:07.536
But it wasn't only the danger
that made life difficult.


206
00:12:12.124 --> 00:12:14.418
A life on the road
was even harder


207
00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:18.172
because most of the people in the towns
were Christian,


208
00:12:18.255 --> 00:12:21.675
and the blues to them
were considered the devil's music.


209
00:12:22.426 --> 00:12:23.803
Sunday morning come.

210
00:12:24.595 --> 00:12:25.721
You got the preacher.

211
00:12:27.681 --> 00:12:28.766
He ain't making no money.

212
00:12:29.934 --> 00:12:33.395
All your men's mostly at the juke joint.

213
00:12:33.854 --> 00:12:35.648
Juke house been partying all night long.

214
00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:38.359
People don't want me to tell it like this,
but that's the way it is.


215
00:12:38.442 --> 00:12:40.319
The preacher,

216
00:12:40.903 --> 00:12:42.613
he got a service going on.

217
00:12:43.489 --> 00:12:45.783
Nobody there but the womens.

218
00:12:45.866 --> 00:12:47.284
The juke joint and juke house.

219
00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:50.039
These people are making a little money.

220
00:12:50.496 --> 00:12:51.705
But Reverend ain't making none.

221
00:12:54.458 --> 00:12:57.336
"You're gonna go to hell
for listening to that devil music."


222
00:12:58.254 --> 00:13:00.589
The Baptist preachers started that.

223
00:13:00.673 --> 00:13:03.801
Somebody get cut, somebody get in a fight,

224
00:13:04.176 --> 00:13:06.887
"that devil music is causing all this."

225
00:13:09.431 --> 00:13:11.183
When the preacher put that myth out there,

226
00:13:11.934 --> 00:13:13.227
these womens in church,

227
00:13:13.644 --> 00:13:15.604
they started telling some
of their husbands,


228
00:13:15.688 --> 00:13:17.940
"Look, y'all don't start coming to church,

229
00:13:18.023 --> 00:13:19.817
you can go to hell
listening to devil music."


230
00:13:34.874 --> 00:13:36.250
Local legend has it

231
00:13:37.626 --> 00:13:38.626
that...

232
00:13:39.295 --> 00:13:41.380
when he was 18 years old,

233
00:13:43.048 --> 00:13:45.676
Robert Johnson fell in love

234
00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:49.013
with a 15-year-old named Virginia Travis.

235
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:54.226
They lied about their ages
and got married.


236
00:13:56.395 --> 00:14:00.190
Her family were church people
and very religious,


237
00:14:00.274 --> 00:14:04.028
as were most people
in that community on a plantation.


238
00:14:04.737 --> 00:14:07.281
Robert made a pledge to Virginia

239
00:14:07.364 --> 00:14:09.700
that he would give up playing music

240
00:14:09.783 --> 00:14:12.912
and he would become a legitimate farmhand

241
00:14:12.995 --> 00:14:14.580
and he would be a good husband.

242
00:14:14.997 --> 00:14:17.666
So they moved to a plantation

243
00:14:18.417 --> 00:14:19.710
and lived there

244
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:23.339
until Virginia was eight-and-a-half
months pregnant.


245
00:14:30.554 --> 00:14:35.851
Virginia left to be with her grandmother
to give birth to their baby,


246
00:14:36.477 --> 00:14:40.022
while Robert took advantage of the fact
that Virginia was gone


247
00:14:40.105 --> 00:14:41.607
to start playing the guitar again.

248
00:14:44.276 --> 00:14:47.988
He decided to work his way
through some of his old familiar haunts


249
00:14:48.072 --> 00:14:50.991
along the Mississippi River, up Highway 1,

250
00:14:51.075 --> 00:14:55.371
and arrive in time to see his wife
and their new baby.


251
00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:00.918
Well, Robert didn't make it in time.

252
00:15:06.632 --> 00:15:08.884
Virginia died in childbirth

253
00:15:09.718 --> 00:15:13.055
and was already dead and buried
with the baby.

259
00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:37.579
just such a tragic scene.

260
00:15:37.663 --> 00:15:38.914
Here he is,

261
00:15:39.415 --> 00:15:42.209
all excited to see

262

carrying his guitar,
walking into this house,


263
00:15:46.422 --> 00:15:47.965

274

According to
contemporary scholars, it was after that


275
00:16:36.597 --> 00:16:40.434
that Robert's life really
seems to change considerably.


276
00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:43.437
He dedicates his life to his music.

277
00:16:44.605 --> 00:16:47.941
He wasn't satisfied just making a living.

278
00:16:48.859 --> 00:16:52.446
Robert Johnson wanted to be a big star.

281
00:17:01.914 --> 00:17:04.750
And then in July of 1930,

282
00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:07.211
Son House moves to Robinsonville.

283
00:17:09.004 --> 00:17:12.341
Son House was older than Robert Johnson
and he was an established player.


284
00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.428
Son House told me, Robert Johnson,
as the new kid, goes,


285
00:17:16.512 --> 00:17:17.930
"I want to be like that guy."

286
00:17:19.723 --> 00:17:24.853
Robert was only making nickels and dimes
on the corner playing his music


287
00:17:24.937 --> 00:17:26.980
and he wanted to
take it to another level.

288
00:17:27.064 --> 00:17:30.067
He wanted to go from the street corners
to the juke joints


289
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:31.944
where that real money was.

290
00:17:35.739 --> 00:17:40.160
Robert was said to have been
a novice guitar player


291
00:17:40.244 --> 00:17:43.956
who would go to see Son House
and Willie Brown perform.


292
00:17:44.581 --> 00:17:47.000
He'd follow me and Willie around.

293
00:17:49.586 --> 00:17:52.131
And every time we stopped to rest

294
00:17:52.214 --> 00:17:55.759
and set that ol' guitar
over in the corner or something,


295
00:17:55.843 --> 00:17:59.930
he trying to play it and be just noising
the people, you know.


296
00:18:00.264 --> 00:18:02.391
And the folks, they'd come out, say,

297
00:18:02.474 --> 00:18:04.977
"Why don't some of y'all go down
and make that boy


298
00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.855
put that thing down,
he running us crazy."


299
00:18:11.024 --> 00:18:12.442
According to Son House,

300
00:18:12.526 --> 00:18:14.903
Robert would go to fooling around
with the guitars,


301
00:18:14.987 --> 00:18:16.947
and they didn't want him to fool
with the guitars


302
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:18.323
because he might break a string.

303
00:18:20.492 --> 00:18:23.745
So they used to keep running.
"Boy, get away from around here."


304
00:18:23.996 --> 00:18:25.998
You know, he was, like, in the way.

305
00:18:27.583 --> 00:18:30.794
So Robert supposedly said,
"Well, you know, I'll show you."


306
00:18:32.004 --> 00:18:34.882
And then he disappears from the Delta.

307
00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:38.802
Nobody knows where he went

308
00:18:40.053 --> 00:18:41.555
for about a year.

309
00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.315
But then Son and Willie Brown

310
00:18:51.398 --> 00:18:53.901
were playing at a juke
in Banks, Mississippi.


311
00:18:54.902 --> 00:18:59.239
And in the door comes Robert Johnson
carrying a guitar.


312
00:18:59.615 --> 00:19:01.158
And Son says to Willie...

313
00:19:01.241 --> 00:19:03.619
Look who's coming in the door,
got a guitar on his back.


314
00:19:03.702 --> 00:19:06.914
He said, "Oh, that's little Robert."
I said, "Yeah, that's him."


315
00:19:06.997 --> 00:19:09.666
I said, "Boy, now where you going
with that thing?


316
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.044
To noise somebody else to death again?"

317
00:19:12.252 --> 00:19:14.922
He said, "No, just give me a try."
I said, "Well, okay."


318
00:19:17.216 --> 00:19:19.551
He had an extra string he put on

319
00:19:19.635 --> 00:19:23.597
a six-string guitar, made him have--
it's a seven-string.


320
00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.099
Something I ain't never saw before,
none of us.


321
00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.440
♪ Hot tamales and they're red hot ♪

322
00:19:33.523 --> 00:19:35.192
♪ Yes, she got 'em for sale ♪

323

326

327
00:19:50.082 --> 00:19:53.001
And when that boy started playing,

328
00:19:53.085 --> 00:19:54.920
oh, he was gone!

329
00:19:55.003 --> 00:19:56.423
♪ Hot tamales and they're red hot ♪

330
00:19:56.463 --> 00:19:57.881
Robert's so good,

331
00:19:58.382 --> 00:20:00.592
everybody is just blown away.

332
00:20:00.676 --> 00:20:04.388
Son said, "We were just all standing there
with our mouths open,


333
00:20:04.471 --> 00:20:06.556
saying, 'Now, ain't that fast.'"

334
00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:10.686
He was playing in a way
that they'd never heard before.


335
00:20:10.769 --> 00:20:12.437
He was playing that same guitar

336
00:20:12.562 --> 00:20:14.398
they said he couldn't
hold a tune in a bucket.


337
00:20:14.481 --> 00:20:16.566
Now he's outplaying everybody.

338
00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:22.239
And one moment, Johnson
is the mediocre to a bad guitar player.


339
00:20:22.698 --> 00:20:25.867
A year and a half later,
he's an impresario.


340
00:20:26.451 --> 00:20:28.120
He's doing things with the guitar

341
00:20:28.203 --> 00:20:30.414
that even his mentors can't do.

342
00:20:39.965 --> 00:20:41.765
This begins the whole myth of...

343
00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:46.054
how could Robert possibly have gotten
that good that fast?


344
00:20:48.515 --> 00:20:49.516
He did something.

345
00:20:50.434 --> 00:20:52.728
You don't just go away and come back
playing like that.


346
00:20:53.603 --> 00:20:55.355
This man was a nobody.

347
00:20:55.689 --> 00:20:57.149
And all of a sudden,

348
00:20:57.607 --> 00:20:59.109
he's on top of the world.

349
00:20:59.192 --> 00:21:01.445
That put fear in people that...

350
00:21:01.903 --> 00:21:03.739
he been hangin' out at the crossroads.

351
00:21:03.822 --> 00:21:05.240
This man ain't nothing but a devil.

352
00:21:09.202 --> 00:21:10.245
The myth goes...

353
00:21:11.163 --> 00:21:13.790
Robert went to the crossroads.

354
00:21:19.212 --> 00:21:22.132
And he's supposed to have
gotten down on his knees...


355
00:21:23.675 --> 00:21:25.344
handed his guitar to the devil.

356
00:21:27.888 --> 00:21:29.973
And the devil's supposed to have
tuned his guitar.


357
00:21:32.434 --> 00:21:34.936
And before he got the guitar back,

358
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.898
the devil said,
"Once you receive the guitar,


359
00:21:37.981 --> 00:21:39.441
your soul is mine.

360
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:41.693
Do you want it?"

361
00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:44.946
That's how he sold
his soul to the devil.

362
00:21:51.495 --> 00:21:53.288
Some of the lyrics that he wrote,

363
00:21:53.663 --> 00:21:55.207
it would make one think,

364
00:21:55.957 --> 00:21:58.335
"Maybe he did sell
his soul to the devil."

365
00:21:59.753 --> 00:22:01.671
Talking about hellhounds on his trail,

366
00:22:01.755 --> 00:22:05.008
and, "Me and the devil
was walking side-by-side."


367
00:22:06.426 --> 00:22:08.345
But if you believe the myth,

368
00:22:08.428 --> 00:22:11.306
it didn't just end with Robert Johnson
selling his soul.


369
00:22:12.766 --> 00:22:15.268
Because if you do make a deal
with the devil,


370
00:22:15.352 --> 00:22:17.020
you gonna have to pay the price.

371
00:22:25.112 --> 00:22:27.030
The story of Robert Johnson

372
00:22:27.406 --> 00:22:31.785
going down to the crossroads
and making a bargain with the devil,


373
00:22:32.327 --> 00:22:34.955
I think it's reflecting on a tradition

374
00:22:35.038 --> 00:22:37.833
in African American folklore
called "hoodoo."


375
00:22:40.335 --> 00:22:43.338
African American styles of magic.

376
00:22:44.214 --> 00:22:48.844
And hoodoo has these stories
of people going down to a crossroad


377
00:22:49.052 --> 00:22:53.932
and meeting up with an entity who offers
some sort of insight or knowledge,


378
00:22:54.015 --> 00:22:55.475
to learn all kinds of things.

379
00:22:55.892 --> 00:22:59.938
So hoodoo was seen as a way
of gaining control


380
00:23:00.021 --> 00:23:04.776
in a world that was suffused
by violence and limited options.


381
00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:10.365
Hoodoo gave people other possibilities
for living in that world.


382
00:23:13.368 --> 00:23:17.831
Robert Johnson's lyrics are filled
with hoodoo references.


383
00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:20.333
In the song "Come on in My Kitchen,"

384
00:23:20.876 --> 00:23:22.210
he sings a line,

385
00:23:22.294 --> 00:23:25.964
"I've taken the last nickel
out of her nation sack."


386
00:23:26.047 --> 00:23:27.883
♪ Oh, she's gone ♪

387
00:23:28.967 --> 00:23:30.969
♪ I know she won't come back ♪

388
00:23:31.803 --> 00:23:33.805
♪ I've taken the last nickel ♪

389
00:23:34.306 --> 00:23:36.391
♪ Out of her nation sack ♪

390
00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:39.311
The "nation sack" or "mojo bag"

391
00:23:39.394 --> 00:23:42.731
was a luck charm that a woman
wore around her waist.


392
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.066
This was a woman's sexual power.

393
00:23:45.358 --> 00:23:47.319
It's a way of
keeping the man with her.

394
00:23:48.487 --> 00:23:52.616
So by removing the contents
of a woman's nation sack,


395
00:23:52.699 --> 00:23:54.993
this woman no longer
has the power over him,


396
00:23:55.076 --> 00:23:59.039
and now he can invite
whoever he wants to into his kitchen.


397
00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:05.587
We also have to think about
how we are only one generation


398
00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.255
removed from slavery.

399
00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:10.175
And so in "Hellhound on My Trail,"

400
00:24:10.258 --> 00:24:15.222
Johnson talks about sprinkling hot powder
at his door.


401
00:24:15.305 --> 00:24:18.099
♪ You sprinkled hot foot powder ♪

402
00:24:18.183 --> 00:24:20.018
♪ Mmm, around my door ♪

403
00:24:20.393 --> 00:24:23.647
African Americans
refer to "hot powder"


404
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.608
as a means to evade bloodhounds.

405
00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:28.902
♪ A hellhound on my trail ♪

406
00:24:28.985 --> 00:24:30.779
♪ Still out on my trail ♪

407
00:24:31.112 --> 00:24:35.075
That would have been used
by someone fleeing a lynch mob.


408
00:24:35.158 --> 00:24:38.620
And so if we think about
Robert Johnson's stepfather,


409
00:24:38.703 --> 00:24:39.746
Charles Dodds,

410
00:24:39.829 --> 00:24:43.917
that's a reference to, perhaps,
how he evaded a near-lynching.


411
00:24:44.501 --> 00:24:47.837
So I think that that expresses
the psychological torment


412
00:24:47.921 --> 00:24:49.548
of feeling like

413
00:24:49.631 --> 00:24:51.091
lynching is always around the corner,

414
00:24:51.174 --> 00:24:52.342
it's always a possibility,

415
00:24:52.425 --> 00:24:54.678
you are never safe.

416
00:24:57.889 --> 00:25:00.767
At the time when Robert Johnson
was performing these songs


417
00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:02.185
that had hoodoo references,

418
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:05.814
for African Americans,
and black men in particular.


419
00:25:05.897 --> 00:25:08.858
it is addressing the realities
of their world,


420
00:25:09.317 --> 00:25:12.112
and finding power in this magic.

421
00:25:14.406 --> 00:25:18.618
I believe Robert Johnson's
association with hoodoo


422
00:25:18.702 --> 00:25:22.956
and using the references in his lyrics
empowered him.


423
00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.917
It was, "Yeah, if you mess with me,

424
00:25:26.501 --> 00:25:30.380
something bad's gonna happen to you
because it's not just me,


425
00:25:30.463 --> 00:25:32.507
it's the power behind me."

426
00:25:34.509 --> 00:25:36.970
I don't know where
the crossroads story came from,


427
00:25:37.637 --> 00:25:39.931
but I believe to my core...

428
00:25:40.932 --> 00:25:44.352
even if Robert Johnson
actually met the devil,


429
00:25:44.978 --> 00:25:47.939
even if it really happened,
that it's a metaphor,


430
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.774
a wake-up call

431
00:25:50.108 --> 00:25:52.736
for a person to go ahead
and become who they are.


432
00:26:01.077 --> 00:26:04.456
While the myth of the crossroads
has always intrigued people,


433
00:26:05.206 --> 00:26:08.335
there's some evidence that Robert's
incredible transformation


434
00:26:08.418 --> 00:26:11.129
can be traced back
to another story about his life.


435
00:26:11.796 --> 00:26:14.132
My grandfather, Robert Johnson,
left the Delta


436
00:26:15.008 --> 00:26:17.344
and he came back to his birth town,

437
00:26:17.802 --> 00:26:19.220
Hazlehurst, Mississippi,

438
00:26:19.304 --> 00:26:23.350
and he was looking for Noah Johnson
who was his biological father.


439
00:26:24.768 --> 00:26:28.813
In searching for Noah,
he found his mentor, Ike Zimmerman.


440
00:26:29.105 --> 00:26:32.359
Ike was known throughout
Southern Mississippi as being


441
00:26:32.442 --> 00:26:34.152
the best guitarist there was.

442
00:26:40.283 --> 00:26:41.409
Story has it that

443
00:26:41.493 --> 00:26:44.287
Ike Zimmerman and my granddad

444
00:26:44.371 --> 00:26:47.624
used to go in the cemetery
across from Ike's home,


445
00:26:47.707 --> 00:26:49.834
a few miles south of Hazlehurst,

446
00:26:49.918 --> 00:26:51.336
and they would practice there.

447
00:26:52.212 --> 00:26:54.506
Ike told my granddad, "Robert, look,

448
00:26:54.589 --> 00:26:56.883
I don't care how
bad you sound out here.

449
00:26:56.966 --> 00:26:59.177

453

00:27:21.408 --> 00:27:23.785

456

Ike always said

457
00:27:28.331 --> 00:27:31.418
that the only way to learn
how to play the blues


458
00:27:31.835 --> 00:27:34.254
was to sit on a gravestone

459
00:27:34.337 --> 00:27:36.589
at midnight in a cemetery.

460
00:27:37.006 --> 00:27:38.633
And then the "haints,"

461
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.928
which is a southern word
for "ghosts" or 'spirits,"


462
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:43.555
would come out,

463
00:27:43.638 --> 00:27:46.391
and they would teach you
how to play the blues.


464
00:27:47.308 --> 00:27:48.852
They chose this grave

465
00:27:49.894 --> 00:27:51.896
so that they could sit facing each other.

466
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.942
And Ike would be able to teach Robert
everything that he knew


467
00:27:56.192 --> 00:27:57.652
about playing the guitar.

Robert Johnson
had this amazing technique.


479
00:28:40.862 --> 00:28:43.490
It's a contrast and a drama,

480
00:28:43.573 --> 00:28:46.493
from fluctuating rhythms
and tempos and volumes,


481
00:28:46.576 --> 00:28:48.036
and the breathing of the music.

482

♪ ...tell my friend called Willie Brown ♪

483
00:28:50.997 --> 00:28:52.832
It's outside the box.

484
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.461
Robert was a really smart person,

485
00:28:56.586 --> 00:29:00.423
and he was very protective
of how he was doing what he was doing.


486
00:29:01.007 --> 00:29:03.802
So if he saw you watching him play,

487
00:29:03.885 --> 00:29:07.138
he would either turn his back on you
or stop playing.


488
00:29:10.308 --> 00:29:14.020
Johnson was the first guy
you hear on record to do that sound,


489
00:29:14.103 --> 00:29:16.231
and he combined it with the slide,

490
00:29:16.397 --> 00:29:21.528
so it sounded like one guitar
playing up here, uh, melodies,


491
00:29:21.611 --> 00:29:23.154
while another was playing bass,

492
00:29:23.238 --> 00:29:25.114
which I believe he was doing
with his thumb,


493
00:29:25.198 --> 00:29:26.658
'cause he had large hands.

494
00:29:30.703 --> 00:29:33.498
My grandfather said,
"Oh boy, Robert,


495
00:29:33.581 --> 00:29:34.874
his fingers were so long

496
00:29:34.958 --> 00:29:37.418
and he could do stuff that
you would never be able to do."


497
00:29:37.502 --> 00:29:39.212
Can you imagine a guy playing,

498
00:29:39.295 --> 00:29:41.756
got these fingers doing one thing

499
00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.675
and these others doing some other stuff?

500
00:29:43.758 --> 00:29:45.802
Got two or three things going different,
you know?


501
00:29:45.885 --> 00:29:47.387
But he could do that.

502
00:29:50.223 --> 00:29:52.767
There's a sort of synchronization
about the way he plays,


503
00:29:52.851 --> 00:29:55.353
when he plays a little rhythm piece
and then...


504
00:29:55.728 --> 00:29:58.273
just one slide note can kill you, man.

505
00:29:58.356 --> 00:30:00.650
The big thing
about Robert Johnson,


506
00:30:00.733 --> 00:30:02.777
the piano sound that he had

507
00:30:03.111 --> 00:30:04.064
on the guitar.

508
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:05.113
Nobody can do that.

509
00:30:05.196 --> 00:30:06.823
One part of what he's playing

510
00:30:06.906 --> 00:30:08.408
is talking to the other part,

511
00:30:08.491 --> 00:30:10.159
and he's the part in the middle.

512
00:30:12.287 --> 00:30:15.248
That doesn't sound like much to us
'cause we've heard it a million times.


513
00:30:15.331 --> 00:30:18.459
But when he did it,
no one else was yet doing that,


514
00:30:18.543 --> 00:30:21.462
and that becomes the building block
of electric blues,


515
00:30:21.546 --> 00:30:23.715
and if you change it into that,

516
00:30:23.798 --> 00:30:25.508
the building block of rock and roll.

00:30:29.888 --> 00:30:31.514
is playing with the other guy,

520
00:30:32.265 --> 00:30:34.265
and luckily Robert didn't have to worry
about that

Virgie was a schoolgirl,

and Robert made repeated attempts
to get Virgie to come away with him.

But Virgie came from
a very strict, religious family

Robert Johnson.

554
00:32:35.596 --> 00:32:37.765
My dad
only saw his father twice.


555
00:32:38.808 --> 00:32:41.936
Neither time did he get a chance
to really talk to his father.


556
00:32:44.105 --> 00:32:45.440
I remember him

557
00:32:45.523 --> 00:32:50.486
because the second time he came to
my grandfather and grandmother's home


558
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.740
to visit me, I
was near seven years old.

559
00:32:54.782 --> 00:32:56.951
And my dad was looking
out the window.


560
00:32:57.035 --> 00:32:58.953
My great-grandfather said, "Nope,

561
00:32:59.037 --> 00:33:01.372
I can't let my grandson

562
00:33:01.914 --> 00:33:05.585
be a part of the devil's music life."

563
00:33:06.753 --> 00:33:09.213
Claude told me
that he saw his dad saying,


564
00:33:09.297 --> 00:33:11.257
"Here's money for Claude."

565
00:33:11.591 --> 00:33:14.260
He gave money for Grandpa
to give to his child,


566
00:33:14.343 --> 00:33:15.928
he tried to do the right thing.

567
00:33:16.345 --> 00:33:18.931
And I remember him right now,

568
00:33:19.057 --> 00:33:20.349
just like it happened.

569
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.144
But I never seen him again.

570
00:33:27.315 --> 00:33:32.195
Robert's life was just one tragedy
built upon another tragedy.


571
00:33:32.278 --> 00:33:34.405
It just seems to never end for him.

572
00:33:35.782 --> 00:33:40.161
And so he devotes his life
to being a hard-drinking,

he was searching for a freedom within,


593
00:34:42.932 --> 00:34:44.892
he was searching for soul freedom.

594
00:34:46.102 --> 00:34:47.270
And in searching for that,

595
00:34:47.353 --> 00:34:51.190
it caused him to act in the way
that he did a lot of times,


596
00:34:51.274 --> 00:34:53.568
as far as the drinking and the women.

597
00:34:53.651 --> 00:34:55.653

a lot of whiskey

- Yeah.


599
00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.033
That's two things he was crazy about,
whiskey and womens.


600
00:35:02.577 --> 00:35:06.956
Honeyboy was another blues player
who had traveled with Robert Johnson


601
00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:08.249
and played with Robert

602
00:35:08.332 --> 00:35:10.042
on street corners, that kind of stuff.

603
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:13.921
And they were actually
playing together the night


604
00:35:14.005 --> 00:35:17.258
that my granddad's lifestyle
caught up with him,


605
00:35:17.925 --> 00:35:20.553
at a blues juke joint outside
of Greenwood, Mississippi


606
00:35:20.636 --> 00:35:21.929
called Three Forks.

607
00:35:22.013 --> 00:35:23.931
Next to this highway over here,

608
00:35:24.015 --> 00:35:26.767
there was a big juke house,
but all this was flat in here.


609
00:35:26.851 --> 00:35:29.312
- Ahh.
- And the big archives, man, you should--


610
00:35:29.395 --> 00:35:33.191
right behind, betwixt this side and that,
right behind the store.


611
00:35:33.816 --> 00:35:34.942
This is the place.

612
00:35:39.363 --> 00:35:41.282
Robert had taken up

613
00:35:41.365 --> 00:35:44.118
with the wife of one of the people

614
00:35:44.202 --> 00:35:47.079
who worked at the Three Forks juke.

615
00:35:49.498 --> 00:35:51.417
One night at the club,

616
00:35:51.709 --> 00:35:53.920
he let his arrogance...

617
00:35:54.337 --> 00:35:55.504
go too far.

618
00:35:55.588 --> 00:35:57.506
Totally disrespecting,

619
00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.425
you know, the woman's husband.

620
00:36:01.427 --> 00:36:03.554
And they ordered a bottle of whiskey,

621
00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.515
and when they brought him the whiskey,

622
00:36:06.766 --> 00:36:08.142
the seal was broke,

623
00:36:08.601 --> 00:36:10.394
and I don't remember who it was,

624
00:36:10.519 --> 00:36:14.315
but he tried to slap the bottle
out of Robert's hands.


625
00:36:15.066 --> 00:36:18.236
He said, "Man, never drink out of a bottle
when the seal is broke."


626
00:36:18.903 --> 00:36:20.238
So Robert tells him,

627
00:36:20.321 --> 00:36:23.991
"And don't you ever slap another $7 bottle
of whiskey out of my hand."


628
00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.458
My dad always said,
"Don't never drink nothing from nobody


629
00:36:28.496 --> 00:36:29.872
if he bring it to you open."

630
00:36:30.122 --> 00:36:32.625
But the man gave Robert the alcohol.

631
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.335
There was poison in it.

632
00:36:34.585 --> 00:36:35.836
And he drank it that day.

633
00:36:37.964 --> 00:36:41.092
Some say the lady did it,
some say the lady's boyfriend did it,


634
00:36:41.175 --> 00:36:42.843
some of them said
the house man did it.

635
00:36:43.052 --> 00:36:45.263
All they could say
is that he was poisoned.


636
00:36:46.305 --> 00:36:47.807
According to Honeyboy,

637
00:36:47.890 --> 00:36:49.767
Robert was kind of slumped over
in the chair,


638
00:36:50.142 --> 00:36:52.812
and people there were trying to get him
to take another drink


639
00:36:52.895 --> 00:36:55.690
so he'd keep playing,
and he just wasn't able to.


640
00:36:56.899 --> 00:37:01.028
That night, he was basically
on his hands and knees and stuff,


641
00:37:01.112 --> 00:37:03.948
you know, howling like a wolf
or something.


642
00:37:04.031 --> 00:37:05.491
He was hurting so bad.

643
00:37:06.117 --> 00:37:08.869
It took a long time for him to die,
like two or three days.


644
00:37:08.953 --> 00:37:10.246
He was real sick.

645
00:37:11.497 --> 00:37:13.582
What a hell of
a way to go out,

646
00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:16.460
you know, because of his ego

647
00:37:17.169 --> 00:37:18.921
and his lust, you know.

648
00:37:19.005 --> 00:37:20.047
What a waste.

649
00:37:20.381 --> 00:37:21.590
That's the way I see it.

650
00:37:28.556 --> 00:37:30.850
But the man who gave Robert
this poison whiskey,


651
00:37:31.517 --> 00:37:32.685
the man got off free.

652
00:37:34.228 --> 00:37:36.939
They come to him,
but they didn't arrest him.


653
00:37:37.023 --> 00:37:38.190
They do nothing.

654
00:37:38.691 --> 00:37:41.277
And the black people didn't push it.
You know why?


655
00:37:41.485 --> 00:37:42.570
Robert Johnson...

656
00:37:43.237 --> 00:37:44.238
sang devil music.

657
00:37:50.619 --> 00:37:51.829
Robert Johnson,

658
00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:55.124
because he was this walking blues man,

659
00:37:55.207 --> 00:37:56.876
because he was sort of a rebel,

660
00:37:56.959 --> 00:37:59.754
because he played by his own rules,

661
00:37:59.837 --> 00:38:02.340
it ended up costing him.

662
00:38:04.091 --> 00:38:06.469
People who want to see Johnson's death

663
00:38:06.552 --> 00:38:10.389
as evidence of this deal with the devil,

664
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:13.684
it is the bill coming due,

665
00:38:14.185 --> 00:38:17.646
and paying for this great musical ability

666
00:38:18.397 --> 00:38:19.565
with his life.

667
00:38:29.492 --> 00:38:33.829
♪ I feel like blowing my
Old lonesome home ♪


668
00:38:40.795 --> 00:38:43.714
I was at my father's place one day

669
00:38:43.798 --> 00:38:45.049
and he had told me,

670
00:38:45.132 --> 00:38:49.512
"In 1938, I put on a concert
at Carnegie Hall in New York


671
00:38:49.595 --> 00:38:51.472
called 'Spirituals to Swing, '

672
00:38:51.555 --> 00:38:53.974
and one of the artists
I was trying to find


673
00:38:54.058 --> 00:38:56.519
was Robert Johnson to put on the show."

674
00:39:02.108 --> 00:39:04.527
John Hammond had this idea

675
00:39:04.819 --> 00:39:08.364
that people should understand
where jazz came from,


676
00:39:08.447 --> 00:39:09.448
where swing came from,

677
00:39:10.074 --> 00:39:13.536
and the real roots
of the deep country blues.


678
00:39:14.078 --> 00:39:16.705
And so he put together this concert

679
00:39:17.081 --> 00:39:21.210
and he sent a scout to Mississippi
looking for Robert Johnson,


680
00:39:21.377 --> 00:39:25.005
and saying, you know, "Please bring him up
to play at Carnegie Hall."


681
00:39:25.381 --> 00:39:28.843
And the guy went down there
and found that Johnson had died.


682
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.972
He had died like six months

683
00:39:33.055 --> 00:39:35.433
before this show was gonna be.

684
00:39:39.854 --> 00:39:43.107
So as the house lights
in Carnegie Hall went down...


685
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.864
a spotlight was Illuminating a phonograph,

686
00:39:49.947 --> 00:39:52.116
a Victrola on the center stage.

687
00:39:53.075 --> 00:39:54.952
John Hammond came out of the wings.

688
00:39:58.247 --> 00:40:02.334
My father played a recording
of Robert's for the audience.

00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:30.404
They just thought that he was terrific.

694
00:40:38.204 --> 00:40:40.247
After the Carnegie Hall event,

695
00:40:40.331 --> 00:40:43.918
there was a brief flurry of interest
in Robert Johnson,


696
00:40:44.001 --> 00:40:47.671
but the general public still
remained largely unaware of Robert.


697
00:40:47.755 --> 00:40:49.715
His records were not being played
on the radio.


698
00:40:56.263 --> 00:41:00.351
After hearing Robert Johnson's
music a few years later,


699
00:41:00.684 --> 00:41:04.563
the great blues player, Muddy Waters,
went to Chicago


700
00:41:04.647 --> 00:41:09.193
and basically laid the groundwork
for what became modern blues.


701
00:41:15.241 --> 00:41:19.662
Robert Johnson affected
my guitar-playing via Muddy Waters.


702
00:41:19.745 --> 00:41:22.623
You can hear the Mississippi mud in there,
you know,


703
00:41:22.706 --> 00:41:24.625
and some of Johnson's phrasing.

707
00:41:32.758 --> 00:41:34.927
there's a little bit of Johnson
in all of them.


708
00:41:35.886 --> 00:41:38.973
But the world wasn't listening
to Johnson directly.


709
00:41:39.056 --> 00:41:42.059
They were listening to other people
playing music


710
00:41:42.142 --> 00:41:44.186
influenced by Robert Johnson.

711
00:41:48.023 --> 00:41:50.609
It wasn't until the 1950s

712
00:41:50.693 --> 00:41:54.196
when you have the emergence
of what I like to call the "78 Geeks."


713
00:41:54.572 --> 00:41:57.866
These were young, white college students

714
00:41:57.950 --> 00:42:00.452
who would go to thrift shops

715
00:42:00.536 --> 00:42:03.497
and just buy boxes and boxes of 78s.

716
00:42:03.581 --> 00:42:07.501
Every once in a while,
they'd come across a Charley Patton 78,


717
00:42:07.585 --> 00:42:09.795
or they'd come across a Robert Johnson 78,

718
00:42:09.878 --> 00:42:13.632
and this is really how
the whole blues craze


719
00:42:13.716 --> 00:42:16.010
of the late '50s and early '60s began,

720
00:42:16.093 --> 00:42:18.345
by these people hearing this music

721
00:42:18.429 --> 00:42:22.099
that was unlike anything that anybody
had ever heard before...


722
00:42:24.184 --> 00:42:26.061
...and that's when John Hammond

723
00:42:26.145 --> 00:42:27.771
gets the idea that,

724
00:42:27.855 --> 00:42:31.734
"Hey, this would be a great time
for me to re-release


725
00:42:32.318 --> 00:42:34.153
Robert Johnson's recordings."

726
00:42:35.029 --> 00:42:37.448
When King of the Delta Blues
Singers came out,


727
00:42:37.615 --> 00:42:40.784
John Hammond would go on
to play that music


728
00:42:41.368 --> 00:42:44.788
for Bob Dylan
when Dylan got signed to Columbia,


729
00:42:44.872 --> 00:42:48.917
and Dylan says that had he not
heard Robert Johnson when he did,


730
00:42:49.001 --> 00:42:52.838

00:45:25.699 --> 00:45:28.952
so young, and then be taken so quickly.

784
00:45:30.037 --> 00:45:34.291
A musician's life
is fraught with danger.


785
00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.878
It's a pretty dark road at times,
you know?


786
00:45:37.961 --> 00:45:41.381
No wonder some of the best
go far too early.


787
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:44.885
But luckily I got through it.

788
00:45:44.968 --> 00:45:45.968
So far.

789
00:45:50.015 --> 00:45:51.725
We have a fascination

790
00:45:51.809 --> 00:45:54.937
with the person who holds great promise,

791
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:59.024
but that promise seems to be
snuffed out prematurely.


792
00:45:59.733 --> 00:46:03.695
It has to do with us
trying to find something fantastic


793
00:46:03.779 --> 00:46:07.115
that makes our life
a little bit more interesting,


794
00:46:07.616 --> 00:46:10.494
and possibly, a little bit more dangerous.

795
00:46:11.119 --> 00:46:14.540
It allows us to think
that we're dancing on the edge.


796
00:46:14.915 --> 00:46:17.084
Myth is so powerful

797
00:46:17.209 --> 00:46:22.214
because people want to feel like
they have the reasoning behind things,


798
00:46:22.297 --> 00:46:24.675
to feel like they know.

799
00:46:26.009 --> 00:46:28.387
A lot of things are not for us
to understand.


800
00:46:29.179 --> 00:46:31.348

801
00:46:32.015 --> 00:46:34.434

802
00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:38.730
I believe Robert Johnson
was extremely talented,


803
00:46:38.814 --> 00:46:41.859
extremely gifted, and way off-balance.

804
00:46:41.942 --> 00:46:43.443
You can hear it in the music.

805
00:46:43.527 --> 00:46:45.654
♪ ...was walkin' side-by-side... ♪

Something's spinning strangely
in that man's life,


807
00:46:50.951 --> 00:46:53.537
and it was with Jimi Hendrix,

808
00:46:53.620 --> 00:46:55.499
it was with Kurt Cobain,

809
00:46:55.581 --> 00:46:58.083
and the rest of the
people in the 27 Club.

810
00:47:01.461 --> 00:47:05.382
I don't know about the 27 Club
and the deal with the devil,


811
00:47:05.883 --> 00:47:09.177
but I do know that at some point
in everyone's life,


812
00:47:09.928 --> 00:47:11.889
we come to a crossroads,

813
00:47:11.972 --> 00:47:15.934
and we all have to choose
how much we can sacrifice


814
00:47:16.393 --> 00:47:18.193
in order to achieve greatness.
