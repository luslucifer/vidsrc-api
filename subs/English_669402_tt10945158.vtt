1
00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:17.239
Try to lift this side.

2
00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.319
Go on.

3
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.599
Use the rope.

4
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.480
Shit.

5
00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.679
Lower this side.

6
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.840
Turn it around. Right around.

7
00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.120
Get it out again.

8
00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:48.239
Careful...

9
00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.840
Put it on the side.

10
00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.319
What's going on?

11
00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.039
We have a problem.
The casket is too big for the vault.


12
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.879
So, we have to take it out

13
00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:03.319
and try to widen
the opening of the vault


14
00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:06.280
with a chisel to
try to get it in.

15
00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:10.120
Well, if that helps...

16
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.879
Benoît... our friend...

17
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.879
you were great, not just in size.

18
00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.639
And you were strong,
not just physically.


19
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.919
You meant a lot to us.

20
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.560
More than a colleague, a friend.

21
00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.840
You were...

22
00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.400
I'll say it: You were a giant.

23
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.359
And often a guide

24
00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.720
inside and outside work.

25
00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:36.960
We'll miss that.

26
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.000
I solemnly swear that your wife
and son can count on us.


27
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.000
Your family is our family.

28
00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.639
Franck, why don't you
finish this at home?


29
00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.680
A CHANGE OF HEART

30
00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.079
Give us a hand.

31
00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.720
Florian!

32
00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.479
What's going on?

33
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.120
Stop it.

34
00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.840
- Come in!
- 'Evening, Gisèle.


35
00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:53.960
Good evening.

36
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.000
- Wow!
- Get used to it!


37
00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.240
- Let's go.
- OK.


38
00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.479
- Bitch!
- Give me your hand.


39
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.120
What for?

40
00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.840
- To wash you.
- OK.


41
00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.159
Just my hands.
I can do my ass.


42
00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.920
Can't you do it any better?

43
00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.319
- You gonna be long?
- I'm done.


44
00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:28.160
You can't work days
for at least a month.


45
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.360
Why?

46
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.560
We have to wait till Sylvie leaves.

47
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.800
Chantal, ER just called.

48
00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.120
They want to send us 3 patients.

49
00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.120
- What are they?
- Sudanese.


50
00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.120
- No.
- I said we had free beds.


51
00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.959
We don't want 'em.

52
00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.759
This is a geriatric ward.
Don't they get that?


53
00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.399
You scared me!

54
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.480
Jungle, please.

55
00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:11.399
What?

56
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.240
I want to go to Jungle.

57
00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.360
- Can you take me?
- No.


58
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.519
No, I'm going home.

59
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.399
For fuck's sake!

60
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.079
Are you OK?

61
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.480
You should be more careful.
I looked.


62
00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.719
Be careful. That's dangerous.

63
00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:04.839
Come!

64
00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.959
It's cold. Come on.

65
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.519
Come on!

66
00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:09.879
Shit, I hope we're not lost.

67
00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:14.120
Recognize it?

68
00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:19.360
What's wrong with them?

69
00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:22.759
They are going to England.

70
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.000
They scared me.

71
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.040
Here.

72
00:07:49.399 --> 00:07:51.079
Thank you.

73
00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.399
You're welcome.

74
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.160
Oh, for fuck's sake!

75
00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.600
Hey, you!

76
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.360
Stop! Give me that!

77
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.440
Give me that!

78
00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.120
What the hell?

79
00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:25.440
Is that how you thank me?

80
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.519
Why d'you do that?

81
00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:31.520
Scum of the earth!

82
00:09:47.079 --> 00:09:48.319
What are you doing?

83
00:09:58.999 --> 00:10:00.239
Do that later.

84
00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.880
Goodnight.

85
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.560
Hello.

86
00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:52.959
I have some clothes to drop off.

87
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.680
Go over there.

88
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.400
Hello.

89
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.640
Hello, ma'am. How are you?

90
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.680
- Need a hand?
- They're my husband's clothes.


91
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.680
- Zymako.
- Béatrice.


92
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.839
- Are you with the charity?
- No.


93
00:11:27.479 --> 00:11:28.520
Hello.

94
00:11:29.999 --> 00:11:31.760
I have more in the car.

95
00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:34.959
Can you find that laundry bowl?

96
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.920
- Is your car over there?
- Yes.


97
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.119
Why not give us a hand?

98
00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.280
No, I'm just getting rid of stuff.

99
00:11:45.359 --> 00:11:48.719
I work with old folk.
So, blacks and Arabs, no, thanks!


100
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.560
Are you a nurse?

101
00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:58.680
No, I'm a nurse's aide
in a geriatric ward.


102
00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.119
- That's great.
- Thanks.


103
00:12:01.199 --> 00:12:02.800
Well, we'll manage.

104
00:12:03.239 --> 00:12:05.119
The two of us can do this.

105
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.920
Where's your husband?

106
00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:08.440
He died.

107
00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.040
Goodbye and thanks.

108
00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.999
Did you hear what she said?

109
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.959
What a racist!

110
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.400
Really?

111
00:13:00.599 --> 00:13:03.079
- English? Do you speak English?
- No.


112
00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.440
- Hi there!
- I haven't heard from you in ages.


113
00:13:37.479 --> 00:13:39.400
There's a photo at the station.

114
00:13:39.479 --> 00:13:41.599
Really? Which one?

115
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.800
A good one. In uniform.

116
00:13:45.119 --> 00:13:47.760
Yeah, they wouldn't use
a photo of him


117
00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:49.999
dying of cirrhosis in the hospital.

118
00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:15.440
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.


119
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.800
- Life?
- Yeah.


120
00:14:19.319 --> 00:14:20.680
Plenty of work.

121
00:14:21.199 --> 00:14:23.199
Every day, more show up.

122
00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.239
They even beat each other up.

123
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:30.599
One got lost
the other day at the hospital.


124
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.160
- He asked for a lift.
- Really?


125
00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:34.359
I said OK.

126
00:14:36.359 --> 00:14:37.520
Why did you do that?

127
00:14:38.599 --> 00:14:39.680
I don't know.

128
00:14:41.119 --> 00:14:42.119
What got into you?

129
00:14:46.319 --> 00:14:47.479
You really did that?

130
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.040
How reckless!
He could've attacked you.


131
00:14:52.119 --> 00:14:53.999
- He was a kid.
- Still...


132
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.560
They have nothing to lose.
They can be dangerous.


133
00:14:58.319 --> 00:15:00.040
I dropped him off.

134
00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:01.239
He thanked me.

135
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.040
That's all.

136
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.520
We keep getting complaints
about theft and rape.


137
00:15:06.599 --> 00:15:08.719
It's not called the jungle
for nothing.


138
00:15:09.319 --> 00:15:11.920
They're worse than our Arabs.
Real savages!


139
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:14.959
Béatrice, be careful.

140
00:15:15.999 --> 00:15:17.959
I'd hate anything
to happen to you.


141
00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.440
30 minutes, at the most.

142
00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.520
OK.

143
00:15:54.599 --> 00:15:55.599
Hi.

144
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.440
Excuse me. Bye.

145
00:15:57.839 --> 00:16:00.199
I brought you clothes, remember me?

146
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.880
Yes, strangely enough.

147
00:16:01.959 --> 00:16:04.479
What does "strangely enough" mean?

148
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.800
Look, I have to pick up
unsold goods.


149
00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.199
They give you unsold stuff?

150
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.359
Does helping blacks and Arabs
shock you?


151
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.119
I don't care.

152
00:16:17.199 --> 00:16:18.599
They're with me.

153
00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.479
Come on, guys! Let's go!

154
00:16:44.999 --> 00:16:46.119
Where to?

155
00:16:46.199 --> 00:16:47.440
A free canteen.

156
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.119
Françoise...

157
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.519
- I've brought this.
- Thanks.


158
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:05.279
Antoine, we have to settle this.

159
00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:07.080
Hello.

160
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.880
He gets overwhelmed by silly stuff.

161
00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:11.600
Why did he put it here?

162
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.680
Hello.

163
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.120
- Ingrid.
- Béatrice.


164
00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:26.999
You're new here, aren't you?

165
00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:29.600
- It's my first time here.
- OK.


166
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.440
- Do a fucking list.
- I don't have time.


167
00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:33.759
What's wrong?

168
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.400
- Hello, Monique.
- I'm not Monique. I'm Béatrice.


169
00:17:37.479 --> 00:17:39.519
Oh, shit, yeah...

170
00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.440
Monique texted me to say
she couldn't come.


171
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.360
- What do you mean?
- She can't come. You know how it is.


172
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.120
I don't come often.

173
00:17:48.199 --> 00:17:51.840
I have a big delivery
arriving in an hour. What'll I do?


174
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.759
- Look, I forgot.
- But...


175
00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.239
- Don't go off the deep end!
- I'm not. Listen...


176
00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.640
- I just need to be told.
- I know.


177
00:17:59.719 --> 00:18:02.239
That's all. What'll I do now?

178
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.320
I'll give you a hand.
It won't take long.


179
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.360
- It will.
- I can help.


180
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.759
- Really?
- Sure.


181
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.519
I'm only doing this
because I have a big heart.


182
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.400
- I take photos here.
- I'm not asking you to.


183
00:18:15.479 --> 00:18:17.239
It's nobody's job.

184
00:18:22.239 --> 00:18:25.479
- I can help out this afternoon.
- And tomorrow?


185
00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:28.920
I have a job. Not tomorrow.

186
00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:32.199
- I work nights.
- You're only here today?


187
00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:34.680
They've knocked down
the southern part,


188
00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:37.279
4,000 people have come here.

189
00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:39.680
They're all here together,

190
00:18:39.759 --> 00:18:44.039
but they don't get on.
So, we volunteers smooth things over.


191
00:18:45.239 --> 00:18:46.279
OK?

192
00:18:49.479 --> 00:18:51.959
I love volunteering

193
00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.320
and getting to know
the people who work here


194
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.719
and winning their trust.

195
00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.120
Hi.

196
00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.680
Hello.

197
00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:06.519
Hello, gentlemen.

198
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.680
We don't want this camp to exist,
but it exists


199
00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:20.640
because of the politicians.

200
00:19:20.719 --> 00:19:22.999
We don't want people
to live like this.


201
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.239
They cover their faces
to protect their families


202
00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.160
in case people from back home
recognize them.


203
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.719
Excuse me.

204
00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.440
We could hear a car coming.
Suddenly, there was a bang!


205
00:21:16.519 --> 00:21:18.880
You're laughing?
It's not funny.


206
00:21:18.959 --> 00:21:22.640
It looks like a body
being thrown out. The car drives off.


207
00:21:22.719 --> 00:21:24.920
I say: "Go see."
It's his job.


208
00:21:24.999 --> 00:21:26.360
He was scared stiff.

209
00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:28.959
Can you believe it?
The scaredy-cat!


210
00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.160
That's why you became a cop!

211
00:21:31.239 --> 00:21:34.519
You're brave with your pals
and when you're in uniform.


212
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:35.920
And your gun!

213
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.840
- Go on.
- Be quiet!


214
00:21:41.959 --> 00:21:45.080
Do you want to lick it?
I bet you do!


215
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.840
Oh, how lovely.

216
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.640
It's my gift in that case!

217
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.719
- I didn't help him choose.
- Really?


218
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.360
- Thanks.
- She chose, he paid.


219
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.160
You really spoiled me.

220
00:22:02.239 --> 00:22:03.920
Well, it's a celebration.

221
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.479
Great! Really pretty.

222
00:22:10.239 --> 00:22:12.080
Thanks, it's lovely.

223
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.959
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.


224
00:22:33.959 --> 00:22:35.759
It's your birthday.

225
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.719
- It's over, I'm old now.
- It's a new phase of life.


226
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.120
I can't wear this pullover.

227
00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.600
- Why not?
- It's gross!


228
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.440
And it's too small.

229
00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:48.279
Yeah, that's true.

230
00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.239
So, give it away.

231
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:52.640
I can't. It'd upset Dominique.

232
00:22:53.239 --> 00:22:54.640
It's not nice.

233
00:22:54.719 --> 00:22:55.880
It's a gift.

234
00:22:55.959 --> 00:22:57.799
I can find a home for it.

235
00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:01.080
- I gave Benoît's clothes away.
- Who to?


236
00:23:01.479 --> 00:23:02.600
The refugees.

237
00:23:03.039 --> 00:23:06.400
Hang on, you gave Benoît's clothes
to immigrants?


238
00:23:06.479 --> 00:23:08.120
The migrants in the jungle.

239
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.320
What about French people?

240
00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:14.360
I gave them to people in need.

241
00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:17.199
- What're you playing at?
- I'm not.


242
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.640
Really?

243
00:23:19.479 --> 00:23:22.519
Do you want to disgrace yourself?

244
00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.400
- Disgrace myself?
- Yes.


245
00:23:24.479 --> 00:23:27.719
Benoît must be spinning in his grave.

246
00:23:27.799 --> 00:23:31.400
- You think?
- It's not what he would've wanted.


247
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.120
That's my opinion...

248
00:23:34.199 --> 00:23:35.759
Well, Benoît is dead.

249
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.239
So, he can spin all he likes.

250
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.680
Know what those people do?

251
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.039
- Yeah, they're migrants.
- Yeah.


252
00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.120
No, but...

253
00:23:48.199 --> 00:23:50.279
I'll give it to the cleaner.

254
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.160
It'll shine in the dark!

255
00:23:54.239 --> 00:23:57.719
- All those stars and things!
- Not so loud.


256
00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.360
Nobody can wear that.

257
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.320
- Shine bright!
- Quiet.


258
00:24:05.039 --> 00:24:07.239
It'd really suit her.

259
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:11.400
A really kitsch singer
with hair like this.


260
00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:14.239
I know, I know!

261
00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:18.440
- She has huge boobs.
- My wife!


262
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:21.519
Her name sounds like "amour".

263
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.320
Lova Moor!

264
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.680
He represents the Catholic Church.

265
00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:26.880
The Pope!

266
00:24:26.959 --> 00:24:28.920
It's what a monkey eats.

267
00:24:28.999 --> 00:24:29.999
Bananas!

268
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.199
- Foucault!
- We've done him.


269
00:24:34.279 --> 00:24:35.519
So what?

270
00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:38.039
An insect which doesn't live long.

271
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:39.600
- Mayfly!
- Butterfly!


272
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:41.959
- OK...
- You're not going so soon?


273
00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:43.880
- I am.
- Come on!


274
00:24:43.959 --> 00:24:44.959
Well, thanks.

275
00:24:49.039 --> 00:24:50.120
Bye.

276
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.840
- What got into you?
- What?


277
00:25:05.239 --> 00:25:07.320
Why do you provoke them?

278
00:25:07.719 --> 00:25:10.479
You've changed, Béa.
Everyone says so.


279
00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.559
I know it was hard with Benoît.

280
00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.799
- "Hard"?
- Well, we liked him, but...


281
00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.360
You mean the beatings?

282
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.999
Here. I stole your pullover.

283
00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.959
- Bye!
- Wait, let's talk.


284
00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.279
Excuse me.

285
00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:34.680
Hello.

286
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.239
What's that?

287
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.680
He said that he don't want
to drink water.


288
00:26:01.999 --> 00:26:04.519
Nothing that goes through his lips.

289
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.519
- No drink...
- That's dangerous.


290
00:26:10.239 --> 00:26:13.160
- His drink.
- No, he doesn't want to drink.


291
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.719
They said did I make something here?

292
00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:21.120
I did something here,
so for me, it's final.


293
00:26:26.999 --> 00:26:29.479
Where can they go? 
They can't leave.

294
00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:31.120
They have no tents,

295
00:26:31.199 --> 00:26:32.719
no blankets...

296
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.160
We stay and try to help.

297
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.519
Not bad.

298
00:26:40.959 --> 00:26:42.080
Who wants it?

299
00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:45.400
Mom, didn't we have some straws?

300
00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.719
- What do you want?
- Straws.


301
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.999
Here.

302
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.320
Thanks. Where were they?

303
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.600
In the living room.

304
00:27:54.519 --> 00:27:55.600
You coming?

305
00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.999
Hello there.

306
00:28:03.039 --> 00:28:05.440
Hi. Françoise is looking for you.

307
00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:11.400
- You know Ingrid, the journalist?
- Yeah.


308
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.759
She needs a place
to finish editing her video.


309
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.600
Could you put her up?

310
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.559
Well... why not?

311
00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.640
My mother does all the housework,
so I'll have to ask her.


312
00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:28.680
- But...
- It's so she can work in the day.


313
00:28:28.759 --> 00:28:30.400
- That's all.
- Yeah, but...


314
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.440
I mean, she just can't work here.

315
00:28:34.039 --> 00:28:36.080
- Just for a few days...
- OK.


316
00:28:36.479 --> 00:28:38.759
- I'll ask my mother.
- OK, thanks.


317
00:28:39.479 --> 00:28:40.519
See you later.

318
00:29:02.719 --> 00:29:03.759
Hello.

319
00:29:09.959 --> 00:29:10.999
Hi.

320
00:29:12.479 --> 00:29:13.640
Where are they?

321
00:29:13.719 --> 00:29:15.840
- They've gone.
- Where?


322
00:29:16.479 --> 00:29:17.759
I don't know.

323
00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.039
When did they go?

324
00:29:22.719 --> 00:29:24.559
- Can I leave this here?
- Sure.


325
00:29:26.719 --> 00:29:29.160
- What is it?
- It's for the Iranians.


326
00:29:38.239 --> 00:29:39.239
Ingrid...

327
00:29:41.239 --> 00:29:42.880
Where are the Iranians?

328
00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:44.039
They've gone.

329
00:29:45.199 --> 00:29:47.999
There's a request for extradition.
Hang on.


330
00:29:48.759 --> 00:29:49.959
When did they go?

331
00:29:51.239 --> 00:29:52.320
Wait!

332
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.719
- Sorry.
- It's OK.


333
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.519
Are they in England?

334
00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:59.320
No, actually, they're...

335
00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:02.759
Maybe they'll go, but not right away.

336
00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:04.799
Meaning?

337
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:06.719
Well, they've gone.

338
00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.559
Did you know?

339
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.640
Yeah. Anyway, they've gone.
They were scared of being dublined.


340
00:30:14.719 --> 00:30:15.759
What's that?

341
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:21.080
You're fingerprinted in one country,
you can't get asylum elsewhere.


342
00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.600
If it's done in France,
you stay here.


343
00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.920
- So, it's good news?
- Yes, they're fine.


344
00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:28.640
OK.

345
00:30:28.719 --> 00:30:32.799
Actually, they had an opportunity.

346
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.680
So, we decided to...

347
00:30:34.759 --> 00:30:37.400
Well, the less you know, the better.

348
00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:41.239
Are you in touch?

349
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.039
Françoise said
you need a place to work.


350
00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.479
- Yeah.
- I have to ask my mother.


351
00:30:49.559 --> 00:30:52.400
OK, thanks.
You live with your mother?


352
00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.120
That's nice.
I'm not making fun. It's cool.


353
00:30:56.199 --> 00:30:59.160
Well, I live with her,
so I'll ask her.


354
00:30:59.239 --> 00:31:00.680
It's like in Japan.

355
00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.759
I'm not making fun.

356
00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.160
Hello.

357
00:32:06.719 --> 00:32:10.279
I'm Joe. I gave Ingrid a hand.

358
00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.600
- Haven't we already met?
- Your face looks familiar.


359
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.279
We put her things there.

360
00:32:17.199 --> 00:32:18.320
I'll take you back.

361
00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.999
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.


362
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.559
Actually, I'd like to sleep here
if that's OK with you.


363
00:32:30.999 --> 00:32:35.239
I'm sick of spending the night
in the jungle. It's hard as a woman.


364
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:38.519
We're in the minority.
I'm at my wit's end.


365
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.440
Sure. I should have offered.

366
00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:44.920
Thanks a lot.
I'll just go get my things.


367
00:32:44.999 --> 00:32:47.160
- What are they?
- My work things.


368
00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.360
You can't leave
your things unattended.


369
00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.199
So, I leave all my stuff
in my car.


370
00:32:55.199 --> 00:32:57.360
Mom, she's sleeping here.

371
00:33:02.479 --> 00:33:03.600
Hey.

372
00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.320
You can have my room.
I'll sleep in the basement.


373
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:09.400
You can have a good sleep.

374
00:33:09.479 --> 00:33:12.120
That's kind.
I can't help you with my back.


375
00:33:12.199 --> 00:33:15.239
Know what?
I'll take a few things upstairs.


376
00:33:22.239 --> 00:33:24.479
- 'Night.
- I thought you wouldn't...


377
00:33:24.959 --> 00:33:27.519
- What?
- You wouldn't say goodnight.


378
00:33:28.559 --> 00:33:30.440
Don't wake them up.

379
00:33:30.519 --> 00:33:32.519
OK, boss! 'Night.

380
00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.680
Goodnight.

381
00:34:04.559 --> 00:34:05.599
Hi.

382
00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:12.999
You should see
the state of your room.


383
00:34:13.079 --> 00:34:14.360
Why?

384
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:16.400
The door was half-open.

385
00:34:19.559 --> 00:34:20.920
And that's not all.

386
00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.880
Hello.

387
00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:32.479
- Osman.
- I'm Béatrice, his mother.


388
00:34:33.479 --> 00:34:34.599
You OK?

389
00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:43.320
Sorry, I should've said.

390
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.639
He just came to take a shower.

391
00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.959
His whole family's dead.
I thought it'd do him good


392
00:34:51.039 --> 00:34:53.079
to watch TV with Florian.

393
00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:54.840
He loved it.

394
00:34:56.559 --> 00:34:57.959
- OK.
- Thanks.


395
00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:01.920
I'll get some things from my room.
Florian, lay the table.


396
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.479
- Osman?
- No, thanks, I don't drink.


397
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.079
- Ingrid?
- No, thanks.


398
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.519
Not in front of him.

399
00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:20.360
Do you have fish knives?

400
00:35:22.519 --> 00:35:24.159
You don't have fish knives?

401
00:35:24.599 --> 00:35:25.999
- No.
- Oh...


402
00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:29.200
It doesn't matter.
It's just to show Osman.


403
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:32.280
In France, they have knives for fish.

404
00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:36.639
It lets you separate
the flesh from the bones.


405
00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.280
I'd love to see you try.

406
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.880
He's used to eating with his fingers.

407
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.360
I'd love to see you
using a fish knife!


408
00:35:46.639 --> 00:35:48.959
- Yeah, OK...
- I don't use 'em, either.


409
00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.679
You can't eat with your fingers.

410
00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.479
We all have things to learn from

411
00:35:55.559 --> 00:35:56.880
each other's cultures.

412
00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.159
Thanks to the jungle,
I can do it all.


413
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.679
How modest.

414
00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.240
- In terms of eating.
- Oh...


415
00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.760
As for the rest...

416
00:36:10.119 --> 00:36:12.200
When did you arrive, Osman?

417
00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.039
- In France?
- Yeah.


418
00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.240
A long time ago. 
It's been 3 years.

419
00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.119
Did you come straight here?

420
00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.599
I left the Sudan and arrived
in Libya. I took a boat...


421
00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:24.800
Libya to Italy...

422
00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.880
4 days.

423
00:36:26.959 --> 00:36:28.800
- On your own?
- No.


424
00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.599
I came with 150 people.

425
00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:34.720
No, but did you leave your family?

426
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.800
Yes, they're in the Sudan.

427
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.479
Tell what happened at the station.

428
00:36:39.559 --> 00:36:41.200
I arrived at the station.

429
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:45.840
But I didn't go out
because I was underground.


430
00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.360
Tell it properly, how you told me.

431
00:36:48.959 --> 00:36:52.039
It was the first time
I'd seen trains underground.


432
00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:55.679
In his country, he'd never seen
trains underground.


433
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.760
He didn't know where he was.

434
00:37:03.519 --> 00:37:06.240
- You know...
- Yes, he can sleep here.


435
00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.280
You can sleep here, Osman.
OK?


436
00:37:08.679 --> 00:37:11.880
There's a spare mattress
in Florian's room he can use.


437
00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:20.119
She's here to work,
not treat the place like a hotel.


438
00:37:24.639 --> 00:37:28.679
She brought her dirty laundry
and just left it in the kitchen.


439
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.679
Florian doesn't do that.

440
00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:35.519
You're getting walked all over.

441
00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.760
'Morning, son. 
Time to get up.

442
00:37:57.079 --> 00:38:00.559
The whore! What a fucking whore!

443
00:38:00.639 --> 00:38:03.039
- She's a whore!
- What's wrong?


444
00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:06.599
She's screwing him!
That disgusts me!


445
00:38:06.999 --> 00:38:08.200
Filthy bitch!

446
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.079
I'm so fucking naive!

447
00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.880
What a whore!

448
00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.519
She's out of here tonight!

449
00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.760
- She's gone.
- Gone for good?


450
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.999
I didn't understand.

451
00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:58.519
- Where to?
- I don't know.


452
00:38:59.519 --> 00:39:00.999
What about all her mess?

453
00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.760
Shit! I wanted to yell at her.

454
00:39:18.039 --> 00:39:20.159
- Hi.
- Hi. What're you doing here?


455
00:39:20.639 --> 00:39:23.280
- You look well.
- Yeah. What's going on?


456
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.320
A migrant fell off a truck.
His head was ripped off.


457
00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:30.479
Yeah, it's terrible.
Things are tough for us.


458
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.119
For you? Really?

459
00:39:34.519 --> 00:39:38.240
Nothing. I don't want
to have that discussion with you.


460
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.880
- What?
- Nothing.


461
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:43.159
You sound like you're talking
about a dog.


462
00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.720
Well, what can I say? It's true.

463
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:48.360
Calm down. I didn't kill him.

464
00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.760
- Can I go?
- Yes.


465
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.840
Bye.

466
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.320
Hey, Joe!

467
00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:01.440
Are you OK? It's terrible.

468
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:04.479
- Did they tell you?
- Yeah.


469
00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.479
- Do you know him?
- We can't see him.


470
00:40:08.559 --> 00:40:10.200
Béatrice, move along.

471
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.920
Out of the way, sir.

472
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.479
- Hello.
- I'm Béatrice.


473
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.999
- I'm Sonia.
- I'm here to see Joe.


474
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.079
No, I hate that!

475
00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:30.200
No, stop it. I don't like it.

476
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.159
Don't spray her. Give me that.

477
00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.240
- It's silly, but it annoys me.
- It's not silly.


478
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:40.200
Béatrice is a friend.
Don't shoot at her.


479
00:40:40.999 --> 00:40:42.760
- Can you take him?
- OK.


480
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.599
Thanks.

481
00:40:44.679 --> 00:40:45.959
What's going on?

482
00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:48.200
- Remember the sewed-up lips?
- Yes.


483
00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.400
There's a problem.

484
00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.079
We tried to help Mokhtar and Dara.

485
00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:55.079
They've just been robbed.

486
00:40:55.159 --> 00:40:56.959
- How so?
- We had a plan.


487
00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:00.559
Well, Ingrid did.
They went to Bilbao.


488
00:41:00.999 --> 00:41:01.999
Why?

489
00:41:03.159 --> 00:41:04.679
For a people smuggler.

490
00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:08.280
Ingrid put them in touch,
but they got robbed.


491
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:11.320
- What?
- Sorry.


492
00:41:13.039 --> 00:41:14.280
Yeah, well...

493
00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:15.959
We can't blame her.

494
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:21.039
- We can!
- She tries, but she's useless.


495
00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:25.559
I found them in a parking lot.
They'd been locked up.


496
00:41:25.639 --> 00:41:26.639
Really?

497
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.959
I promised I'd try to help them.

498
00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.039
- How?
- It's now or never.


499
00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:38.800
It's time to step things up a gear.

500
00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:39.920
Meaning?

501
00:41:39.999 --> 00:41:42.999
I really want to help them
get to England.


502
00:41:45.039 --> 00:41:46.679
That's a good idea.

503
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.519
How, though?

504
00:41:48.999 --> 00:41:50.720
In a truck, I think.

505
00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.240
It's nice to have them,

506
00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:56.440
but with the kids
and the baby on the way,


507
00:41:56.519 --> 00:41:59.559
Sonia, and my job...
They're here?


508
00:41:59.639 --> 00:42:03.360
- Oh, I didn't tell you?
- No, I didn't realize...


509
00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:05.320
They're here. I'll call them.

510
00:42:06.679 --> 00:42:07.880
Mokhtar, Dara...

511
00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.959
Come here.
I'll introduce you to Béatrice.


512
00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.679
Beatrice.
You met before.


513
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.360
We met.

514
00:42:22.599 --> 00:42:23.639
Sit down.

515
00:42:23.959 --> 00:42:25.599
What do you want to drink?

516
00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:28.840
- Anything. Milk.
- Milk?


517
00:42:29.159 --> 00:42:31.519
- And you?
- Beer.


518
00:42:38.959 --> 00:42:39.959
Cheers.

519
00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:44.999
Could you put them up
in 2 days' time for a while?


520
00:42:45.079 --> 00:42:47.479
That'd give me time to find a truck.

521
00:42:47.559 --> 00:42:49.440
If you can't, just say so.

522
00:42:49.519 --> 00:42:50.760
- At my place?
- Yeah.


523
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.639
- Yes.
- What? You can't?


524
00:42:55.159 --> 00:42:56.559
- Yes, I can.
- OK.


525
00:42:56.639 --> 00:42:58.840
But you can ask your mother.

526
00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.240
No, it's OK.

527
00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.240
I'll call you tomorrow
to fix a time, OK?


528
00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.360
Bye.

529
00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:09.039
- So?
- No. I said no.


530
00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:12.079
- Let me explain.
- No need. I said no.


531
00:43:12.159 --> 00:43:14.479
It's getting impossible here.

532
00:43:14.559 --> 00:43:17.200
There are limits to generosity.

533
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:21.400
Don't bring those refugees home.

534
00:43:21.479 --> 00:43:24.880
- It's not like with Ingrid.
- I said no.


535
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.760
- It was fun at first, but enough.
- "Fun"?!


536
00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.920
Look, the Iranians
are staying here, in my home!


537
00:43:31.999 --> 00:43:33.760
Joe: I'll bring them tomorrow

538
00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.479
It's up to me, OK?

539
00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.159
Sure!

540
00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:40.800
Well, I can decide to go.
Then what'd you do?


541
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.440
You wouldn't last a week
without me!


542
00:43:43.959 --> 00:43:48.320
You're the one who wouldn't last
a week, Mom. I'm putting you up.


543
00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:56.479
The only reason I'm here
is for Florian.


544
00:43:57.159 --> 00:43:58.200
Yeah, I know.

545
00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:00.599
Tell them they're welcome

546
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.119
Well, give them a hand.

547
00:44:17.959 --> 00:44:18.959
Here we are.

548
00:44:19.039 --> 00:44:20.880
This is my room.
You sleep here.


549
00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:23.720
Where will you sleep
if this is your room?


550
00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.720
Where will you sleep?

551
00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:28.360
- Down.
- In the cellar.


552
00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:29.999
You want to sleep in the cellar?

553
00:44:30.079 --> 00:44:31.440
- What?
- The cellar.


554
00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:33.119
It's not a cellar.

555
00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:36.200
There are windows
onto the backyard. It's fine.


556
00:44:36.519 --> 00:44:39.639
- You keep your room.
- No, I decide. You sleep here.


557
00:44:41.159 --> 00:44:42.599
There, that's settled.

558
00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.800
There. Garden.

559
00:44:55.039 --> 00:44:57.119
- What's this?
- A fork.


560
00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:59.959
Yes, thank you, Béatrice.
I know it's a fork.


561
00:45:00.679 --> 00:45:03.840
I wanted to know if it was clean.
Mine has gone.


562
00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.320
Stolen forks...

563
00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:07.479
- 3rd one!
- 5th!


564
00:45:08.119 --> 00:45:09.280
He's counting!

565
00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.639
- That's crazy.
- Pregnant cravings!


566
00:45:13.999 --> 00:45:15.720
Well, I have an excuse!

567
00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.599
Béatrice, you look glowing.

568
00:45:21.039 --> 00:45:24.079
- Thanks.
- How do you keep such a figure?


569
00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.959
- I shouldn't ask?
- What?


570
00:45:28.039 --> 00:45:31.200
I don't know if one can ask women...

571
00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:34.800
It's a compliment.
I think you look...


572
00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:35.959
Well, thanks.

573
00:45:36.599 --> 00:45:38.039
Very desirable.

574
00:45:38.559 --> 00:45:40.079
Give it a rest.

575
00:45:40.159 --> 00:45:42.880
- You're 54, pal.
- Well, that's my type.


576
00:45:43.679 --> 00:45:45.599
I've always had older men.

577
00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:47.519
- How old are you?
- 44.


578
00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:50.039
How elegant to ask her age!

579
00:45:50.119 --> 00:45:53.200
- I don't care.
- You don't look it.


580
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.800
I lied, too. I'm 45!

581
00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.400
Never had guys your age?

582
00:45:57.479 --> 00:45:59.479
- Or younger?
- No, never.


583
00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.240
See?

584
00:46:02.039 --> 00:46:04.400
Is even 46 unthinkable?

585
00:46:05.039 --> 00:46:07.479
46 is a bit young!

586
00:46:07.559 --> 00:46:10.079
So, you see, I'm with a chance.

587
00:46:10.159 --> 00:46:12.599
No, nobody stands a chance with me.

588
00:46:13.519 --> 00:46:15.320
How do you know?

589
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:20.280
I don't want anyone under my feet.
I've been there, done that.


590
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.760
Well, Béatrice looks stunning.

591
00:46:23.519 --> 00:46:26.440
- You're not subtle.
- OK, I'll go get a sausage.


592
00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.959
A nice sausage!

593
00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:02.320
What do I do?

594
00:48:12.559 --> 00:48:13.559
Yes.

595
00:48:56.999 --> 00:48:57.999
What do you want?

596
00:48:58.079 --> 00:48:59.079
What?

597
00:49:00.479 --> 00:49:01.920
What do you want?

598
00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:25.760
I'm going to bed.

599
00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.400
Good night.

600
00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.079
Good night.

601
00:49:49.079 --> 00:49:50.159
See you tomorrow.

602
00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.800
We'll go. You wait here.

603
00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.039
Hey!

604
00:51:03.119 --> 00:51:04.999
Are you still having breakfast?

605
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.920
Sorry, I didn't think
you got up this late.


606
00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.119
- OK?
- Yeah.


607
00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:19.200
What's wrong?
I'm just here to get my things.


608
00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:21.880
Don't move,
we'll give them to you. Florian!


609
00:51:23.039 --> 00:51:24.119
Why?

610
00:51:24.519 --> 00:51:26.360
You fucked me over.

611
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.599
I'm not a sucker.

612
00:51:29.639 --> 00:51:31.720
Go on, Florian.
Help him, Osman.


613
00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.959
I don't understand.
What's wrong?


614
00:51:34.039 --> 00:51:35.920
The boy in your bed...

615
00:51:35.999 --> 00:51:39.679
Oh, that's it! Oh, I see!
Right...


616
00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.360
So, you judge me

617
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:44.840
because you put me up for a night?

618
00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:48.720
- A night?
- OK, a few nights. So, you judge me?


619
00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.559
No, I can't judge you,

620
00:51:50.639 --> 00:51:53.479
but I can say I don't trust you.

621
00:51:53.559 --> 00:51:55.720
I'm not the only one.

622
00:52:05.159 --> 00:52:06.400
I don't believe it!

623
00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:16.880
- Hi, Florian.
- Hi.


624
00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.360
Thanks.

625
00:52:22.679 --> 00:52:24.079
I'll take that, too.

626
00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:29.599
Osman... Beware of her,
she's not good for you.


627
00:52:31.119 --> 00:52:33.280
Don't say that, you don't know.

628
00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:41.119
I just don't believe it.

629
00:52:45.039 --> 00:52:46.280
He's an adult.

630
00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.800
- Bye.
- Goodbye.


631
00:52:58.519 --> 00:53:00.999
I thought
you were gonna throw it at me.


632
00:53:01.079 --> 00:53:02.320
So long!

633
00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.039
Want herb tea before bed?

634
00:53:23.639 --> 00:53:25.039
I'm not sure.

635
00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.440
What about?

636
00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:24.320
I'll never change my mind

637
00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:58.119
Can I ask you something?

638
00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.280
Yes.

639
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.760
Close your eyes.

640
00:56:06.639 --> 00:56:08.119
Please!

641
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:11.519
Again?

642
00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.880
Is it possible?

643
00:56:57.079 --> 00:56:58.519
I'm going to bed.

644
00:57:03.959 --> 00:57:05.039
So that's it?

645
00:57:06.039 --> 00:57:07.039
Yes.

646
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.920
Okay.

647
00:57:09.999 --> 00:57:10.999
It's okay.

648
00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.639
I'd rather.

649
00:57:16.159 --> 00:57:17.280
Good night.

650
00:57:20.079 --> 00:57:21.079
Yes.

651
00:57:25.039 --> 00:57:26.440
Mokhtar!

652
00:57:32.159 --> 00:57:33.639
Me... Downstairs?

653
00:57:46.039 --> 00:57:47.159
Wait till...

654
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.920
till Dara is asleep.

655
01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.240
And you?

656
01:02:45.119 --> 01:02:46.159
Two years ago.

657
01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.720
And you? When?

658
01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:17.320
Really? Does that happen?

659
01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:29.800
And you like it? Money?

660
01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.440
Yes, maybe, a little bit.

661
01:03:33.079 --> 01:03:34.479
Just like that?

662
01:03:34.559 --> 01:03:36.880
You say that like that?

663
01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.880
You realize what you're saying?

664
01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.360
Oh well, now that's it,
I have...


665
01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.639
Finally it happened.

666
01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.840
- Does it worry you?
- Not anymore.


667
01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.599
- It's over.
- You didn't regain your appetite?


668
01:04:48.679 --> 01:04:49.880
No.

669
01:04:52.119 --> 01:04:53.720
Food is all we have.

670
01:04:54.599 --> 01:04:56.280
It's not bad here.

671
01:04:57.039 --> 01:04:59.119
- It's not bad?
- No, it's not.


672
01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.999
Aren't some people strict?

673
01:05:02.639 --> 01:05:03.720
Bossy.

674
01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.479
Pretentious.

675
01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.720
We told the manager,
but what can you do?


676
01:05:10.159 --> 01:05:12.119
There are idiots everywhere.

677
01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.320
I'm afraid, I'm afraid...

678
01:05:14.959 --> 01:05:20.800
We visited the town,
it was a good fun...


679
01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:36.760
My God!

680
01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.720
Oh, no, my fucking mirror!

681
01:05:54.479 --> 01:05:56.400
I can't even get in my car.

682
01:05:56.959 --> 01:05:58.639
There's shit all over it.

683
01:06:01.079 --> 01:06:02.320
Oh, man...

684
01:06:03.079 --> 01:06:04.920
Right... Fuckers!

685
01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.639
OK, let's go.

686
01:06:37.599 --> 01:06:38.800
No, no!

687
01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.440
Oh, shit!

688
01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.320
- Forgot something?
- Shut up!


689
01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:43.559
I love your eyes.

690
01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.079
They're beautiful.

691
01:07:46.999 --> 01:07:49.159
It's not that they're beautiful.

692
01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.999
I can see your kindness.

693
01:07:53.119 --> 01:07:55.639
There's an expression that says...

694
01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.479
eyes are the mirror of the soul.

695
01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:09.440
Eyes are the mirror of the soul.

696
01:08:11.159 --> 01:08:12.320
That's weird.

697
01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:13.840
What?

698
01:08:13.919 --> 01:08:16.759
If it's a mirror
you don't see my soul.


699
01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:22.000
You see your own reflection
in the mirror.


700
01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:25.719
You see you in my eyes.

701
01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:29.519
In fact, that's your kindnes.

702
01:08:31.519 --> 01:08:32.559
No.

703
01:08:33.639 --> 01:08:35.080
I'm not kind.

704
01:08:37.759 --> 01:08:39.280
You're welcome. Hi!

705
01:08:40.559 --> 01:08:41.679
It's hot.

706
01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:45.400
- OK, Issa?
- Yes, you?


707
01:08:46.639 --> 01:08:48.360
- Here.
- Thank you.


708
01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:50.320
Hi.

709
01:08:50.639 --> 01:08:52.200
That's not enough.

710
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.040
Bye.

711
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:10.839
I'm not Muslim.
I converted to Catholism.


712
01:09:11.519 --> 01:09:12.519
Not Dara.

713
01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:16.440
It's different for me
but I respect his choice.


714
01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:18.559
It's all part of history of Iran.

715
01:09:18.639 --> 01:09:23.040
Basically the state forces people
to respect Islam laws...


716
01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.120
And this is one of the main
reason for my departure.


717
01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.160
What? I didn't get it.

718
01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:37.200
The state forced him to be a Muslim.
It's one reason he left.


719
01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:38.879
I know that.

720
01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:51.960
Hi.

721
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.440
Am I disturbing you?

722
01:09:53.519 --> 01:09:56.360
Not at all.
We're having a barbecue.


723
01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:59.160
- Want to eat something?
- No, thanks.


724
01:10:02.679 --> 01:10:05.839
The police station had
an anonymous call about you.


725
01:10:07.519 --> 01:10:11.000
Normally we don't pay much attention,
but as it's you...


726
01:10:12.559 --> 01:10:16.320
I gather
you've taken in refugees.


727
01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.440
No.

728
01:10:22.879 --> 01:10:24.280
I hope it's not true.

729
01:10:25.919 --> 01:10:27.120
Know what you risk?

730
01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.400
30,000 euros and 5 years in prison.

731
01:10:32.799 --> 01:10:33.839
Really?

732
01:10:35.719 --> 01:10:38.040
And there's the risk
for you and Florian.


733
01:10:39.519 --> 01:10:41.000
What if something happened?

734
01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:45.759
People would say:
"Well, she asked for it."


735
01:10:46.639 --> 01:10:48.120
They'd be right, too.

736
01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.080
And...

737
01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.080
People talk.

738
01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.599
Oh, yeah, I know.

739
01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.879
Sure you won't have a bite?

740
01:11:00.479 --> 01:11:01.639
I'm not hungry.

741
01:11:02.759 --> 01:11:05.440
And I have a dentist's appointment.

742
01:11:07.559 --> 01:11:09.440
Thanks for letting me know.

743
01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.719
I'll think twice
before taking in refugees.


744
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.200
Bye.

745
01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.679
Who wants a sausage?

746
01:11:27.759 --> 01:11:29.440
Yes, please.

747
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.080
Who was that?

748
01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.080
A friend.

749
01:11:35.559 --> 01:11:37.240
Why didn't you ask him in?

750
01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.000
Well, I did.

751
01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:40.280
He couldn't stay.

752
01:11:41.879 --> 01:11:42.960
What did you say?

753
01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.559
- What?
- What did you say?


754
01:11:45.599 --> 01:11:48.559
- What're you playing at?
- What's gotten into you?


755
01:11:52.839 --> 01:11:54.719
Is this an interrogation?

756
01:11:54.799 --> 01:11:57.440
- We knew about your husband.
- So?


757
01:11:58.479 --> 01:12:00.599
- And?
- He's anti-migrant.


758
01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.960
What're you implying?

759
01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:07.639
Say loud and clear
what's on your mind.


760
01:12:07.719 --> 01:12:12.120
He's part of an anti-migrant group.
He was my husband's friend.


761
01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.360
An old friend. And?

762
01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.519
Whose side are you on?

763
01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.839
Are you done yet?

764
01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:22.240
Look, I don't like your tone.

765
01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.160
You're in my home,
eating my food.


766
01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.799
If you don't like it, you can go.

767
01:12:27.879 --> 01:12:30.320
The same goes for you.
If you don't like


768
01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:34.200
who I am or where I'm from,
nobody's forcing you to stay!


769
01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.639
There's the door! 
Is that clear?

770
01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.479
Spare me your threats
and insinuations.


771
01:12:40.559 --> 01:12:42.400
Just keep your mouth shut!

772
01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.679
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.


773
01:13:16.519 --> 01:13:18.559
I need you to sign this.

774
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.160
It's late. Aren't you in bed?

775
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.440
I have work to finish.

776
01:13:24.879 --> 01:13:28.040
OK, goodnight.
And try knocking next time.


777
01:13:28.759 --> 01:13:30.400
- Goodnight.
- 'Night.


778
01:13:46.599 --> 01:13:47.599
Yes?

779
01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.479
Florian...

780
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.759
I have something to say,
but I don't know how to tell you.


781
01:14:07.759 --> 01:14:09.000
The thing is...

782
01:14:10.599 --> 01:14:11.759
Mokhtar and I...

783
01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:13.440
What?

784
01:14:17.639 --> 01:14:19.160
Mokhtar and I...

785
01:14:19.799 --> 01:14:21.080
Are you shitting me?!

786
01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.320
- You're shitting me!
- No.


787
01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:29.559
- Shut up. Get out!
- I'm your mom...


788
01:14:29.639 --> 01:14:32.879
- Get out.
- I'm not asking for your opinion.


789
01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.519
Get out of my room!

790
01:14:34.599 --> 01:14:36.000
You're shitting me!

791
01:14:37.240 --> 01:14:38.919
You're like that whore!

792
01:14:39.879 --> 01:14:41.000
Seriously?

793
01:14:42.719 --> 01:14:45.160
Stop lecturing other people.

794
01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.879
Who do you think you are
with your refugees?


795
01:14:48.919 --> 01:14:49.919
Fuck!

796
01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:54.960
You're a fucking pain!
We've put up with all your shit!


797
01:14:55.919 --> 01:14:58.400
So you can get laid
like some dumb kid!


798
01:14:58.479 --> 01:15:01.400
You're pitiful, pathetic!
You're a kid!


799
01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:07.040
Get out! Enough!

800
01:15:08.599 --> 01:15:09.719
Stop it!

801
01:15:33.479 --> 01:15:35.839
- What's going on?
- Nothing.


802
01:15:35.919 --> 01:15:37.160
We had a fight.

803
01:15:37.679 --> 01:15:40.280
Mokhtar and I are together.
'Night.


804
01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:01.160
Yeah?

805
01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:03.559
Yes.

806
01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.040
Alright.

807
01:16:13.679 --> 01:16:14.879
When?

808
01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.719
Two days.

809
01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.320
Slow down a bit.

810
01:16:23.639 --> 01:16:24.679
On the left.

811
01:16:24.759 --> 01:16:25.799
Look.

812
01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.519
It's easy to get over that gate.

813
01:16:28.599 --> 01:16:32.599
It's a godsend.
There's nobody around.


814
01:16:32.679 --> 01:16:34.839
- No cameras?
- Nope.


815
01:16:34.919 --> 01:16:37.040
Usually there are. Not here.

816
01:16:45.599 --> 01:16:46.599
See?

817
01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.759
I would like to tell you

818
01:17:53.839 --> 01:17:57.799
how much everything you gave me since
the first moment is precious to me.


819
01:17:57.879 --> 01:18:00.440
You are precious, Béa,
you are beautiful.


820
01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.559
You are my favorite human being,
forever.


821
01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.120
What's wrong?

822
01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.280
You speak
as if you were saying farewell,


823
01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.599
as if we'd never see
each other again.


824
01:18:23.679 --> 01:18:25.240
As if you were leaving me.

825
01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.040
I just want to make you happy.

826
01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:50.080
I can't.

827
01:18:50.639 --> 01:18:51.919
Sorry.

828
01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.599
You can't?

829
01:18:59.799 --> 01:19:01.599
You can't...

830
01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.719
You can't?

831
01:19:07.679 --> 01:19:10.839
Mokhtar... it may be the last time.

832
01:19:11.639 --> 01:19:13.719
You're going to England.

833
01:19:13.799 --> 01:19:16.919
You might forget me.
It may be the last time.


834
01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.599
No, I won't stop
because you're leaving,


835
01:19:20.679 --> 01:19:22.759
and I don't understand why.

836
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.000
I have to go to England.

837
01:19:40.679 --> 01:19:42.040
This is my life.

838
01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.320
This is my way.

839
01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.839
It's my project.

840
01:19:49.599 --> 01:19:51.599
It's my project since really long time.

841
01:19:54.679 --> 01:19:58.519
I don't talk about you
when I say I go to England.


842
01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.919
I don't see why you're going.

843
01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.280
How can you love me and go?

844
01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.280
How can you love me
and ask me this question?


845
01:20:46.719 --> 01:20:48.360
I'm not a liar.

846
01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:52.559
We can make the most of each other,
and that's a good thing.


847
01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:54.960
You want to be certain
love is pure,


848
01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.320
but I don't know if love is pure.

849
01:20:57.839 --> 01:21:02.000
But the electricity between us
also comes from our differences.


850
01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.479
We often love opposites, don't we?

851
01:21:04.559 --> 01:21:09.040
If you have doubts about me,
that won't let us move on.


852
01:21:09.599 --> 01:21:13.240
But it's not the first time
someone has doubted me.


853
01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:18.040
In my country, they tried to kill me
because I was different.


854
01:21:19.519 --> 01:21:21.080
What're you talking about?

855
01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:31.400
What're you talking about?

856
01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.360
I don't understand.

857
01:21:43.639 --> 01:21:45.559
You wan't understand me?

858
01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.200
Yes.

859
01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.679
Béatrice.

860
01:22:25.519 --> 01:22:26.639
I love you.

861
01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.080
You say my name in full.

862
01:22:32.799 --> 01:22:33.799
Yes.

863
01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.160
Because I love you in full.

864
01:22:38.879 --> 01:22:40.719
So, why don't we get married?

865
01:22:50.599 --> 01:22:51.599
Answer me.

866
01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:03.839
I don't want to get married
for papers... to stay.


867
01:23:04.919 --> 01:23:09.120
If one day, we get married,
it's because we will be free.


868
01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:38.320
Hey, Joe... What's that?

869
01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.280
What?

870
01:23:41.799 --> 01:23:44.280
- Are they all going?
- They're Sudanese.


871
01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:47.759
- But it's too dangerous...
- I briefed them.


872
01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:53.440
Come! Mustafa, Mohamed,
Mokhtar, Dara. Béatrice.


873
01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.839
Ok. Let's go!
You can take your bags.


874
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.519
Good luck. Bye!
Good luck, bye. Good luck!


875
01:24:55.559 --> 01:24:58.320
How are you, Mr. Bouvier?
Did you sleep well?


876
01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.320
- I didn't sleep, did I?
- You didn't?


877
01:25:01.879 --> 01:25:05.040
I don't know. I don't remember.

878
01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:08.080
- I'm losing my memory.
- Are you?


879
01:25:08.479 --> 01:25:11.759
- That's why I'm here.
- I know.


880
01:25:15.559 --> 01:25:19.240
It looks like it's going to snow.

881
01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:21.519
- Snow?
- Yes, snow.


882
01:25:21.599 --> 01:25:24.200
- It might snow.
- Or sleet.


883
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.360
Well, I say!

884
01:25:34.879 --> 01:25:38.559
- I'll just rinse...
- The radiators aren't very hot.


885
01:25:43.559 --> 01:25:45.799
David, can you finish up here?

886
01:25:45.879 --> 01:25:47.200
- Sure.
- Thanks.


887
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.639
Shit!

888
01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:08.120
They'll let you go.
That's the procedure. Don't worry!


889
01:26:57.799 --> 01:26:59.639
I'm Mokhtar Madhavi!

890
01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.000
Dubline me!

891
01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.679
Dubline me!

892
01:27:10.839 --> 01:27:13.759
I was born in Teheran!

893
01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:15.440
Yeah, I know.

894
01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:19.240
- Béa, I'm Mokhtar Madhavi.
- I know, Mokhtar.


895
01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:22.719
Dubline me,
I was born in Teheran.


896
01:27:24.799 --> 01:27:27.320
- I'm Mokhtar Madhavi!
- Stop it.


897
01:27:27.759 --> 01:27:29.440
Dubline me, please!

898
01:27:29.519 --> 01:27:32.879
I'm Mokhtar Madhavi, dubline me!

899
01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:34.400
Stop it!

900
01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:37.759
I'm sorry, Florian.

901
01:27:37.839 --> 01:27:42.519
Dubline me! Please!
I was born in Teheran!


902
01:27:42.599 --> 01:27:47.320
Dubline me. I'm Mokhtar.

903
01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.120
There's still a solution.

904
01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.360
What's that?

905
01:28:23.839 --> 01:28:24.960
A boat.

906
01:28:28.559 --> 01:28:29.839
Find somewhere quiet.

907
01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:32.360
Go by boat.

908
01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.160
I'm not for that.

909
01:28:36.559 --> 01:28:37.599
Why?

910
01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:41.040
Going in a truck is dangerous,

911
01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:43.679
but going by boat
is very dangerous.


912
01:28:43.759 --> 01:28:44.960
It's possible to die!

913
01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:50.000
Trucks don't work anymore.
A boat is the last solution.


914
01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:51.599
Maybe, but...

915
01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:55.160
It's okay for me.
I have nothing to loose.


916
01:28:55.759 --> 01:28:58.360
To live is to do what
the possibility of dying.


917
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.040
What?

918
01:29:00.879 --> 01:29:03.679
Basically, he said
he has nothing to lose.


919
01:29:04.679 --> 01:29:06.240
That's nice to hear.

920
01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.120
Wait.

921
01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:55.200
I love you.

922
01:30:02.719 --> 01:30:04.320
I love all you are.

923
01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:06.440
But...

924
01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.599
I'm not used
to commitment anymore.


925
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.559
So, the idea of losing you...

926
01:30:16.879 --> 01:30:18.080
tears me apart.

927
01:30:19.559 --> 01:30:20.599
But...

928
01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.679
I want you to be free.

929
01:30:24.639 --> 01:30:25.719
And...

930
01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:29.919
You don't owe me anything.

931
01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:40.040
Go... Go on.

932
01:30:47.919 --> 01:30:49.960
I don't like this idea.

933
01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:52.479
Look, it'll be OK. Don't worry.

934
01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:57.080
They have to leave French territorial
waters as fast as possible.


935
01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.719
If they're stopped,
they're in England.


936
01:30:59.799 --> 01:31:01.479
They get dublined over there.

937
01:31:02.280 --> 01:31:03.320
Alright?

938
01:31:03.919 --> 01:31:05.160
We'll tell them that.

939
01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:07.960
We'll try to find a boat.

940
01:31:08.919 --> 01:31:10.240
How much does it cost?

941
01:31:10.879 --> 01:31:13.160
I looked on the net.

942
01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.919
1,000 to 2,000 euros.

943
01:31:16.599 --> 01:31:18.519
- Do you have that much?
- No!


944
01:31:18.599 --> 01:31:20.280
- And you?
- No!


945
01:31:22.679 --> 01:31:25.559
I need to ask you something.
You said...


946
01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:31.799
that if I needed it, that if Florian
and I needed it, I could ask you...


947
01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.440
The thing is...

948
01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:37.000
I need money.

949
01:31:37.879 --> 01:31:39.839
But it's a lot.

950
01:31:39.919 --> 01:31:41.400
- Oh?
- 2,000 euros.


951
01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:44.960
What for?

952
01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:48.919
For the roof. A branch fell on it.

953
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.160
What about your insurance?

954
01:31:52.799 --> 01:31:53.879
It's complicated.

955
01:31:54.799 --> 01:31:56.000
Complicated...

956
01:32:00.919 --> 01:32:04.919
If you can't or you won't,
I understand.


957
01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.400
I didn't say that.
I'm just surprised.


958
01:32:07.799 --> 01:32:09.000
Have you screwed up?

959
01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
You can tell me, whatever it is.

960
01:32:12.559 --> 01:32:14.719
If you're in trouble...
I'm a cop,


961
01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.960
but I'm your friend.
Do you owe someone money?


962
01:32:18.759 --> 01:32:19.799
No.

963
01:32:27.639 --> 01:32:30.639
It was stupid to come here.
I'm sorry.


964
01:32:33.479 --> 01:32:36.599
Béatrice!
What you need is a friend.


965
01:32:37.799 --> 01:32:39.599
Someone who watches over you.

966
01:32:41.759 --> 01:32:43.000
It's true that...

967
01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.040
things have moved very fast,
it's changing...


968
01:32:51.679 --> 01:32:54.559
very fast... I can't...

969
01:32:56.719 --> 01:32:58.839
I can't handle it all.

970
01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:01.080
I can't get my balance.

971
01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:05.160
But...

972
01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:16.440
I just need 2,000 euros for something
I don't want to tell you about.


973
01:33:18.519 --> 01:33:21.440
So, there's no point
coming here to ask you.


974
01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.160
Forget it.

975
01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:28.519
Charity begins at home.

976
01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:31.759
Stay away from the refugees.

977
01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.000
What're you talking about?

978
01:33:37.639 --> 01:33:38.639
I don't know.

979
01:33:42.879 --> 01:33:44.559
Béatrice!

980
01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:54.280
Thank you.

981
01:33:55.839 --> 01:33:57.839
First of all, you put

982
01:33:57.919 --> 01:33:59.919
the chain on the ball.

983
01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.960
So, it's attached to the car.

984
01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.320
Look, now it's clamped on.

985
01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.440
So, it's secure now.
When you drive,


986
01:34:08.519 --> 01:34:10.040
you lift the wheel.

987
01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:11.719
- OK?
- Great.


988
01:34:11.799 --> 01:34:14.280
Goodbye. Thanks.

989
01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.360
Bye.

990
01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.200
Thanks.

991
01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:47.799
Unsupervised beach
Do not swim in bad weather


992
01:36:15.599 --> 01:36:16.799
Where are we?

993
01:36:18.599 --> 01:36:20.320
We can hear it. It's not far.

994
01:36:31.839 --> 01:36:32.919
Wait!

995
01:36:34.759 --> 01:36:37.400
We have to carry
because of the rocks.


996
01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.960
After, you use this.
For the rocks, O.K.?


997
01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.080
Go! Go on!

998
01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.719
Go on, off you go.

999
01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:07.240
Béatrice, let's go.
They've gone.


1000
01:38:08.679 --> 01:38:10.280
It's dangerous to stay here.

1001
01:40:27.519 --> 01:40:28.519
You're here.

1002
01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:36.040
Was it OK?

1003
01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:38.360
Yes.

1004
01:40:39.599 --> 01:40:40.599
Yeah.

1005
01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.400
100 migrants missing
after shipwreck


1006
01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.839
Leave that computer alone.

1007
01:41:29.759 --> 01:41:33.120
Channel crossing: 30 migrants
including 11 children saved


1008
01:41:33.839 --> 01:41:36.080
It's normal not to have any news yet.

1009
01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:41.000
Channel crossing Iranians

1010
01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:44.080
Immediate alerts

1011
01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:46.559
All regions

1012
01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:51.879
- I'll make you some...
- Stop it!


1013
01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.160
I'm not hungry.

1014
01:42:03.719 --> 01:42:06.879
It won't change anything.
You can't starve to death.


1015
01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.240
It's not right...

1016
01:42:18.839 --> 01:42:20.040
It's not right.

1017
01:43:01.719 --> 01:43:03.599
- Still nothing?
- No.


1018
01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:09.559
You need to go get some sleep.

1019
01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:12.040
You can't keep this up.

1020
01:43:14.599 --> 01:43:17.400
I think that if I sleep, he'll die.

1021
01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:20.120
I have to keep my eyes open.

1022
01:43:36.719 --> 01:43:40.040
Iranian migrants rescued
in aborted English Channel crossing.


1023
01:43:41.479 --> 01:43:42.799
Mom!

1024
01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.719
Florian!

1025
01:43:45.479 --> 01:43:46.839
They're alive!

1026
01:43:46.919 --> 01:43:48.599
- What?
- They're alive.


1027
01:43:56.839 --> 01:43:59.839
The boat was sinking.
They called for help.


1028
01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:02.400
It took a long time to find them.

1029
01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.719
They said
smugglers got them across.


1030
01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:10.080
Calm down. They'll call you.

1031
01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.080
My darling...

1032
01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:16.719
I can't calm down,
but that's only natural.


1033
01:45:18.919 --> 01:45:20.440
On June 27, 2017,

1034
01:45:20.519 --> 01:45:24.040
Béatrice Huret was found guilty
of "aiding an illegal alien".


1035
01:45:24.120 --> 01:45:28.200
But the court decided
not to pass sentence.


1036
01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:33.040
She now regularly visits
Mokhtar in England.


1037
01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:36.839
He does all he can
so that one day, their dream


1038
01:45:36.919 --> 01:45:39.879
of living wherever they choose
may come true.
