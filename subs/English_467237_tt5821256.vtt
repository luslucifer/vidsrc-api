1
00:00:16.758 --> 00:00:18.008
Are you on? Are we on?

2
00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:19.803
- Yeah. We're...
- Don't tell me.


3
00:00:19.806 --> 00:00:21.428
All this nonsense? Oh, God.

4
00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:22.723
Okay, let's...

5
00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:24.015
Now, there's gonna be...

6
00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:31.231
Where is the director?

7
00:00:31.232 --> 00:00:32.899
I mean, that man is a disaster.

8
00:00:36.152 --> 00:00:38.279
Tiny secret smiles.

9
00:00:40.115 --> 00:00:41.573
Like what?

10
00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:43.139
I don't remember,

11
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.703
I don't have secrets anymore.

12
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:49.395
This film is like

13
00:00:49.396 --> 00:00:50.457
Gone with the Wind.

14
00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:52.209
Two years on the make.

15
00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.233
I mean, honestly,

16
00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:56.256
this is mingy documentary.

17
00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:01.636
Come here and direct.

18
00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:08.226
I'm sick of this story,

19
00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:09.728
but it's absolute the truth.

20
00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:12.271
The truth is that...

21
00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.231
Um...

22
00:01:14.232 --> 00:01:16.026
- I used to make shoes
- for lizards.


23
00:01:23.366 --> 00:01:24.993
Bárboles is like a big lizard

24
00:01:24.994 --> 00:01:26.618
with a blue thing here.

25
00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.620
It was divine.

26
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:29.790
The lizard was

27
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:30.956
much more easy to do

28
00:01:30.957 --> 00:01:32.521
because they were just,

29
00:01:32.522 --> 00:01:34.085
like, somnolent.

30
00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:39.049
I catch them,

31
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.051
I catch everything.

32
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:46.806
And I used to do it

33
00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:48.599
- with Cadbury's
- chocolate Bon Bon.


34
00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:53.771
And it was heaven. I...

35
00:01:53.772 --> 00:01:55.606
- This is, well,
- may be the only connection


36
00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:57.984
That I had then and now.

37
00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.427
I didn't think about

38
00:02:03.428 --> 00:02:04.866
shoes again till much later.

39
00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.648
- I was very
- in love with feet, yes.


40
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:38.817
I still love feet.

41
00:02:38.818 --> 00:02:39.985
Beautiful ones.

42
00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:42.821
You know, I can't remember

43
00:02:42.822 --> 00:02:43.946
the last time

44
00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:45.448
- I wore
- anybody else's shoes.


45
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:47.408
- I mean, I just
- don't even look at them.


46
00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.672
Manolo Blahnik means, like,

47
00:03:00.673 --> 00:03:02.966
the happiest feet in the world.

48
00:03:04.885 --> 00:03:06.301
He's a poet.

49
00:03:06.302 --> 00:03:07.888
Poet in couture.

50
00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.471
He's a visionary poet.

51
00:03:09.472 --> 00:03:10.787
He's up there

52
00:03:10.788 --> 00:03:12.100
with Baudelaire.

53
00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.419
I guess it was a fixation

54
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.774
since I was a child.

55
00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:21.400
Really good job.

56
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.527
Women dream about

57
00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:23.652
wearing your shoes.

58
00:03:23.653 --> 00:03:24.987
Really, it's a thing.

59
00:03:24.988 --> 00:03:26.782
- I've been hearing that
- and the husbands


60
00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:28.449
- All complaining
- about new love


61
00:03:28.452 --> 00:03:30.243
For me and my shoes.

62
00:03:32.453 --> 00:03:34.914
No one, no one

63
00:03:33.685 --> 00:03:34.915
No one.

64
00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:36.666
have done another shoes

65
00:03:36.667 --> 00:03:38.417
better than Manolo.

66
00:03:38.418 --> 00:03:39.962
He is the emperor of shoes.

67
00:03:39.963 --> 00:03:41.504
And forever will be.

68
00:03:50.972 --> 00:03:53.975
He is the greatest shoemaker

69
00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:56.977
of the 20th and 21st century.

70
00:03:56.978 --> 00:03:58.292
There's not much you can

71
00:03:58.293 --> 00:03:59.604
talk about shoes.

72
00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:01.524
They're made for walking.

73
00:04:28.093 --> 00:04:31.409
My childhood was absolutely

74
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.724
the most extraordinary one

75
00:04:34.725 --> 00:04:36.664
simply because I lived

76
00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:38.602
in a place which is heaven.

77
00:04:38.603 --> 00:04:39.645
I... For me.

78
00:04:49.948 --> 00:04:51.700
- We had the house,
- beautiful house.


79
00:04:51.703 --> 00:04:52.764
Still falling to pieces,

80
00:04:52.765 --> 00:04:53.827
but beautiful.

81
00:04:55.954 --> 00:04:58.206
And very kind of cut off

82
00:04:58.207 --> 00:05:00.458
from the world in the '50s.

83
00:05:02.418 --> 00:05:03.503
And then I had

84
00:05:03.504 --> 00:05:04.586
the wonderful parents,

85
00:05:04.587 --> 00:05:05.922
especially my mother.

86
00:05:07.173 --> 00:05:08.195
She did have

87
00:05:08.196 --> 00:05:09.216
this incredible mind,

88
00:05:09.217 --> 00:05:10.447
a wandering mind.

89
00:05:10.448 --> 00:05:11.676
And she did paint well.

90
00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.200
Everything with her hands,

91
00:05:13.201 --> 00:05:14.723
she did it beautifully.

92
00:05:19.477 --> 00:05:20.708
She was very inventive.

93
00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:21.938
Like me.

94
00:05:26.442 --> 00:05:27.589
Well, she invented

95
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.736
some kind of shoes

96
00:05:28.737 --> 00:05:30.155
and she put through

97
00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:31.571
with pieces of chiffon

98
00:05:31.572 --> 00:05:33.220
that she had from before,

99
00:05:33.221 --> 00:05:34.868
and it was incredible effect.

100
00:05:37.412 --> 00:05:39.122
My father was fluent

101
00:05:39.123 --> 00:05:40.831
in every language.

102
00:05:40.832 --> 00:05:42.542
Spanish even, boom.

103
00:05:43.794 --> 00:05:45.670
- I wish I can speak
- other language


104
00:05:45.673 --> 00:05:47.213
Like my father did.

105
00:05:49.758 --> 00:05:51.634
A really incredible father.

106
00:05:55.013 --> 00:05:57.056
Papa was Austro
-Hungarian,

107
00:05:57.057 --> 00:05:59.683
so imagine...

108
00:05:59.684 --> 00:06:02.041
7:30, bath, nails,

109
00:06:02.042 --> 00:06:04.397
get ready.

110
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.024
He would be very unhappy

111
00:06:07.025 --> 00:06:08.840
with my hair going now,

112
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:10.653
going up.

113
00:06:12.823 --> 00:06:14.303
I was not

114
00:06:14.304 --> 00:06:15.783
very quiet boy, no.

115
00:06:15.784 --> 00:06:16.952
Never was,

116
00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:18.118
never will be.

117
00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:21.121
Yes, I was very demanding.

118
00:06:21.122 --> 00:06:22.332
And my father

119
00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:23.540
had the illusions

120
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:25.147
that if this boy

121
00:06:25.148 --> 00:06:26.752
is gonna be domesticated

122
00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:28.713
or whatever,

123
00:06:28.714 --> 00:06:30.236
uh, we have to put him

124
00:06:30.237 --> 00:06:31.758
in a serious environment.

125
00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:34.426
So when I was 14,

126
00:06:34.427 --> 00:06:35.700
they sent us

127
00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:36.972
to a school in Geneva.

128
00:06:47.065 --> 00:06:48.859
I always been

129
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.650
interested in clothes.

130
00:06:50.651 --> 00:06:52.278
All my money, my pocket money,

131
00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.904
went into magazines.

132
00:06:53.905 --> 00:06:55.990
Queen. Vogue.

133
00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:57.282
American Vogue.

134
00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:58.743
American Bazaar.

135
00:06:58.744 --> 00:07:00.452
It was so exciting.

136
00:07:00.453 --> 00:07:01.851
Pictures of Bailey

137
00:07:01.852 --> 00:07:03.247
with Jean Shrimpton

138
00:07:03.248 --> 00:07:04.707
with hands like this:

139
00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:05.917
And was wonderful.

140
00:07:13.967 --> 00:07:15.217
And in summertime,

141
00:07:15.218 --> 00:07:17.137
- my mother and father
- wanted me


142
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.409
To work

143
00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:19.680
at the United Nations.

144
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.894
But I didn't like it.

145
00:07:23.895 --> 00:07:25.686
I was bored to tears.

146
00:07:28.231 --> 00:07:30.232
I am now 21 or 22.

147
00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:31.608
I want to go.

148
00:07:31.609 --> 00:07:34.486
I want to do things.

149
00:07:34.487 --> 00:07:36.031
I wanted... One moment

150
00:07:36.032 --> 00:07:37.572
I wanted to be a decorator.

151
00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:38.825
What a horror.

152
00:07:38.826 --> 00:07:40.075
But anyway, so...

153
00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:43.038
I decided to go to Paris.

154
00:08:00.305 --> 00:08:01.514
The first time I got

155
00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:02.723
into a conversation

156
00:08:02.724 --> 00:08:04.600
with him was in Paris.

157
00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:10.169
He was so always, you know,

158
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:11.982
so dressed up and a monsieur,

159
00:08:11.983 --> 00:08:13.630
whereas I was a girl

160
00:08:13.631 --> 00:08:15.277
at the time still.

161
00:08:15.278 --> 00:08:16.821
But I was, you know...

162
00:08:16.822 --> 00:08:18.240
I think there was mutual

163
00:08:18.241 --> 00:08:19.657
fascination right away.

164
00:08:22.285 --> 00:08:24.121
And at work it was two women

165
00:08:24.122 --> 00:08:25.955
in an antique business.

166
00:08:25.956 --> 00:08:27.457
- And I loved it
- because I learn a lot.


167
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.397
I always learn things

168
00:08:29.398 --> 00:08:31.335
everywhere I go.

169
00:08:31.336 --> 00:08:33.629
- Paloma used to come down.
- "You work here, are you mad?"


170
00:08:33.632 --> 00:08:35.131
- She used to be there
- all the time.


171
00:08:35.134 --> 00:08:37.091
We're having tea and cookies.

172
00:08:37.092 --> 00:08:38.135
Manolo had

173
00:08:38.136 --> 00:08:39.176
the strangest of diet.

174
00:08:39.177 --> 00:08:41.346
Dried bananas, avocados,

175
00:08:41.347 --> 00:08:43.513
and also this strange liqueur

176
00:08:43.514 --> 00:08:46.330
called advocaat, which was made

177
00:08:46.331 --> 00:08:49.145
of egg yolks, and very sugary.

178
00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:54.484
In June, you will

179
00:08:54.485 --> 00:08:55.901
decide by your votes.

180
00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.611
If you say yes,

181
00:08:57.612 --> 00:08:59.239
I will change those things

182
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.865
which are narrow and outdated.

183
00:09:00.866 --> 00:09:02.180
President De Gaulle announced

184
00:09:02.181 --> 00:09:03.492
his proposed referendum.

185
00:09:03.493 --> 00:09:05.035
No sooner had he spoken

186
00:09:05.036 --> 00:09:06.225
then a fresh wave of anarchy

187
00:09:06.226 --> 00:09:07.412
tore Paris apart.

188
00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:09.708
1968, you know, revolution,

189
00:09:09.709 --> 00:09:12.001
upheaval and demonstration

190
00:09:12.002 --> 00:09:14.503
which I took some part in.

191
00:09:14.504 --> 00:09:16.152
I had this huge purple hat,

192
00:09:16.153 --> 00:09:17.798
and I was really overdressed

193
00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:19.341
for a demonstration.

194
00:09:19.342 --> 00:09:21.177
- Tougher retaliation
- by riot police


195
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.491
Hasn't exactly

196
00:09:22.492 --> 00:09:23.804
cooled the situation.

197
00:09:23.805 --> 00:09:25.514
Police was running after me.

198
00:09:25.515 --> 00:09:26.871
I had to take shelter

199
00:09:26.872 --> 00:09:28.225
inside the Coupole.

200
00:09:28.226 --> 00:09:29.977
And those mean policemen

201
00:09:29.978 --> 00:09:31.500
throwing tear gas bomb

202
00:09:31.501 --> 00:09:33.022
inside the Coupole.

203
00:09:33.023 --> 00:09:34.439
So everybody was crying.

204
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.900
The warning that France

205
00:09:35.901 --> 00:09:37.193
- is on the brink
- of paralysis.


206
00:09:37.196 --> 00:09:38.736
But I don't think Manolo

207
00:09:38.737 --> 00:09:40.613
- ever went to any of those.
- On the contrary,


208
00:09:40.616 --> 00:09:42.011
He would kind of lock himself

209
00:09:42.012 --> 00:09:43.407
into his shop

210
00:09:43.408 --> 00:09:45.681
and not want to know anything

211
00:09:45.682 --> 00:09:47.953
that was happening outside.

212
00:09:47.954 --> 00:09:49.580
I was looking at it, I mean,

213
00:09:49.581 --> 00:09:51.206
like a sort of entertainment.

214
00:09:51.207 --> 00:09:52.229
Can you imagine

215
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.250
how awful to say that,

216
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:54.543
but it's the truth.

217
00:09:54.544 --> 00:09:56.421
- I didn't have any,
- I still don't...


218
00:09:56.424 --> 00:09:58.381
- I mean,
- any political beliefs.


219
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.114
I never liked violence

220
00:10:01.115 --> 00:10:02.426
or marches.

221
00:10:02.427 --> 00:10:04.219
I can't stand crowds.

222
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:05.471
I can't stand smells of people,

223
00:10:05.472 --> 00:10:06.722
I don't like it.

224
00:10:06.723 --> 00:10:08.599
- I never like
- too much people, no.


225
00:10:18.568 --> 00:10:20.112
In '71, I came to London

226
00:10:20.113 --> 00:10:21.653
because I just...

227
00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:23.406
- I knew that I
- really loved London.


228
00:10:23.409 --> 00:10:25.075
London was...

229
00:10:27.285 --> 00:10:28.786
wonderful.

230
00:10:32.958 --> 00:10:34.584
- This is where
- you wanted to be.


231
00:10:34.587 --> 00:10:35.794
This was where

232
00:10:35.795 --> 00:10:37.002
it was happening.

233
00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:38.400
It was bubbling.

234
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:39.797
It was lots of things

235
00:10:39.798 --> 00:10:41.716
that we wanted to discover.

236
00:10:41.717 --> 00:10:43.031
It was also

237
00:10:43.032 --> 00:10:44.343
such a democratic time.

238
00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:45.533
You know, hairdressers

239
00:10:45.534 --> 00:10:46.721
were sitting down

240
00:10:46.722 --> 00:10:48.639
- with duchesses
- for the first time.


241
00:10:48.642 --> 00:10:49.725
I mean, all the rules

242
00:10:49.726 --> 00:10:50.809
were being broken.

243
00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:57.523
It was something

244
00:10:57.524 --> 00:10:58.524
that I never had,

245
00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:00.110
- I never sort of - felt before.

246
00:11:00.113 --> 00:11:01.779
This kind of, um,

247
00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.445
incredible freedom

248
00:11:03.446 --> 00:11:04.990
of the people, the mind,

249
00:11:04.991 --> 00:11:06.531
and everything.

250
00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:08.931
But it seems to me

251
00:11:08.932 --> 00:11:11.328
that a good time...

252
00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:13.144
is much easier had by all now

253
00:11:13.145 --> 00:11:14.957
than ever before.

254
00:11:14.958 --> 00:11:16.814

For the first time

263
00:11:31.413 --> 00:11:32.975
in the history of fashion,

264
00:11:32.976 --> 00:11:35.207
fashion was emerging from

265
00:11:35.208 --> 00:11:37.437
another city that wasn't Paris.

266
00:11:37.438 --> 00:11:39.045
And then you had Mary Quant

267
00:11:39.046 --> 00:11:40.649
and you had Biba

268
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:42.173
and you had all those

269
00:11:42.174 --> 00:11:43.693
marvelous, uh, desi...

270
00:11:43.694 --> 00:11:44.801
And Ossie of course.

271
00:11:44.802 --> 00:11:45.906
Ossie Clark.

272
00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.492
The brilliance

273
00:11:49.493 --> 00:11:50.910
of England's creativity is...

274
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:51.912
And it's why

275
00:11:51.913 --> 00:11:52.913
they're so fearless.

276
00:11:52.914 --> 00:11:54.018
Is that they

277
00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:55.122
start with the talent

278
00:11:55.123 --> 00:11:56.395
rather than thinking about,

279
00:11:56.396 --> 00:11:57.666
"Oh, is it gonna make money?"

280
00:11:57.667 --> 00:11:59.585
- Which tends to be
- a little bit


281
00:11:59.588 --> 00:12:01.587
More the way things happen

282
00:12:01.588 --> 00:12:03.588
in the United States.

283
00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:04.821
All eyes were on London

284
00:12:04.822 --> 00:12:06.050
at that time,

285
00:12:06.051 --> 00:12:07.052
and it must have been

286
00:12:07.053 --> 00:12:08.053
such an exciting

287
00:12:08.054 --> 00:12:10.055
- and amazing time
- to be here.


288
00:12:10.058 --> 00:12:11.431
Where were you?

289
00:12:11.432 --> 00:12:12.807
I was in school, Michael.

290
00:12:12.808 --> 00:12:14.810
Yeah, I'm still in school

291
00:12:14.811 --> 00:12:16.812
but wanting to be part of it.

292
00:12:17.896 --> 00:12:19.106
Dying to be

293
00:12:19.107 --> 00:12:20.315
part of it, yeah.

294
00:12:24.194 --> 00:12:25.904
It was at Feathers

295
00:12:25.905 --> 00:12:27.612
that Manolo discovered me,

296
00:12:27.613 --> 00:12:29.573
and I discovered Manolo.

297
00:12:29.574 --> 00:12:31.158
Mrs. Burstein was important

298
00:12:31.159 --> 00:12:32.744
- because she gave me
- the Green Card.


299
00:12:32.747 --> 00:12:34.537
- At the time you needed
- to have a Green Card.


300
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:35.768
And she said to me, "You speak"

301
00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:36.997
French, Italian, Spanish,

302
00:12:36.998 --> 00:12:38.750
- you speak everything,
- "so get on."


303
00:12:38.753 --> 00:12:40.689
Manolo just came in

304
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.627
and wanted a job.

305
00:12:42.628 --> 00:12:44.130
The personality's

306
00:12:44.131 --> 00:12:45.630
always been there.

307
00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:47.154
The desire

308
00:12:47.155 --> 00:12:48.675
has always been there.

309
00:12:48.676 --> 00:12:50.074
And how can you resist

310
00:12:50.075 --> 00:12:51.470
any of that?

311
00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:53.077
But you know what,

312
00:12:53.078 --> 00:12:54.681
I met a wonderful woman there

313
00:12:54.682 --> 00:12:56.558
called Andrea Crittle.

314
00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:57.936
And we worked very well. We did

315
00:12:57.937 --> 00:12:59.311
send things to the press.

316
00:12:59.312 --> 00:13:01.585
And she had her little area

317
00:13:01.586 --> 00:13:03.858
downstairs where Manolo was.

318
00:13:03.859 --> 00:13:04.902
He could have been

319
00:13:04.903 --> 00:13:05.943
a wonderful PR as well,

320
00:13:05.944 --> 00:13:07.738
- 'cause he would talk
- to everybody.


321
00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:09.343
I don't think I ever saw him

322
00:13:09.344 --> 00:13:10.948
upstairs selling.

323
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:12.117
I think he was so busy

324
00:13:12.118 --> 00:13:13.284
downstairs chatting.

325
00:13:14.494 --> 00:13:15.913
This is where

326
00:13:15.914 --> 00:13:17.329
I learned my trade.

327
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.373
He kept saying to me,

328
00:13:19.916 --> 00:13:21.626
"Mrs. Sidney, Mrs. Sidney,"

329
00:13:21.627 --> 00:13:23.335
I must bring my portfolio.

330
00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:24.378
I must show you.

331
00:13:24.379 --> 00:13:26.339
- I must show you
- "my drawings."


332
00:13:26.342 --> 00:13:27.632
"Manolo, I'd love"

333
00:13:27.633 --> 00:13:28.924
to see your drawings.

334
00:13:28.925 --> 00:13:30.718
"Do bring them in."

335
00:13:30.719 --> 00:13:32.366
Do you think I ever

336
00:13:32.367 --> 00:13:34.013
saw those drawings?

337
00:13:34.014 --> 00:13:35.849
I never even knew

338
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.683
that he drew shoes.

339
00:13:44.941 --> 00:13:46.505
One time I went

340
00:13:46.506 --> 00:13:48.068
to New York with Manolo,

341
00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:49.695
and I met Diana Vreeland to do

342
00:13:49.696 --> 00:13:51.321
some photograph for Vogue.

343
00:13:51.322 --> 00:13:52.804
Uh, of course wanted Manolo

344
00:13:52.805 --> 00:13:54.283
to meet her too.

345
00:13:54.284 --> 00:13:55.994
When people talk about you,

346
00:13:55.995 --> 00:13:57.703
what do you hope they say?

347
00:13:57.704 --> 00:13:59.413
Is that a rude question?

348
00:13:59.414 --> 00:14:00.540
No, I just hope

349
00:14:00.541 --> 00:14:01.665
they say that,

350
00:14:01.666 --> 00:14:02.688
"Isn't she beautiful?"

351
00:14:02.689 --> 00:14:03.709
Isn't she wonderful?

352
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:04.774
Isn't she

353
00:14:04.775 --> 00:14:05.836
the most wonderful?

354
00:14:05.837 --> 00:14:07.213
"Isn't she wonderful?"

355
00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:10.633
Does any woman want

356
00:14:10.634 --> 00:14:12.551
anything else said about her?

357
00:14:12.552 --> 00:14:13.595
She discovered

358
00:14:13.596 --> 00:14:14.636
all those models.

359
00:14:14.637 --> 00:14:16.013
Remember Twiggy?

360
00:14:16.014 --> 00:14:17.431
Veruschka.

361
00:14:17.432 --> 00:14:18.933
Penelope Tree.

362
00:14:18.934 --> 00:14:20.227
She genuinely liked

363
00:14:20.228 --> 00:14:21.518
young people.

364
00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:22.730
Genuinely adored

365
00:14:22.731 --> 00:14:23.938
young people.

366
00:14:23.939 --> 00:14:26.315
She was very clever

367
00:14:26.316 --> 00:14:28.608
at being able to figure out

368
00:14:28.609 --> 00:14:30.216
what people were

369
00:14:30.217 --> 00:14:31.822
meant to be, I think.

370
00:14:33.949 --> 00:14:35.575
I arranged for Mrs. Vreeland

371
00:14:35.576 --> 00:14:37.201
to meet Manolo in the museum.

372
00:14:37.202 --> 00:14:39.120
- He came into her office
- down in the basement.


373
00:14:39.123 --> 00:14:40.455
Very small, red,

374
00:14:40.456 --> 00:14:41.789
hell red, the walls.

375
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.895
Manolo was a big event

376
00:14:42.896 --> 00:14:44.000
meeting Mrs. Vreeland.

377
00:14:48.714 --> 00:14:50.569
Oh, we were, you know, dressing,

378
00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.424
nervous, running, screaming,

379
00:14:52.425 --> 00:14:54.634
screeching, parrots calling.

380
00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:56.033
Howler monkeys

381
00:14:56.034 --> 00:14:57.429
going down to the museum.

382
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:58.995
He gets in her office,

383
00:14:58.996 --> 00:15:00.558
and he's mute.

384
00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:06.522
He is mute. I said,

385
00:15:06.523 --> 00:15:08.273
"My God, Manolo, what up?

386
00:15:08.274 --> 00:15:09.964
Speak, speak, speak. What up?"

387
00:15:09.965 --> 00:15:11.651
Is this really...? He's mute.

388
00:15:11.652 --> 00:15:13.404
He is... He is so mute.

389
00:15:13.405 --> 00:15:15.155
He... He's petrified.

390
00:15:15.156 --> 00:15:16.742
He's, like, he's seen...

391
00:15:17.826 --> 00:15:19.409
a vision.

392
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.641
It really could have been

393
00:15:20.642 --> 00:15:21.871
a disaster.

394
00:15:21.872 --> 00:15:24.039
It was a disaster, in fact.

395
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.917
Because I was terrified.

396
00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:27.793
I was, like, speechless.

397
00:15:27.794 --> 00:15:28.795
It was a very

398
00:15:28.796 --> 00:15:29.797
important figure.

399
00:15:33.759 --> 00:15:35.260
She had to do all the talking.

400
00:15:35.261 --> 00:15:36.761
She met him and she adored him.

401
00:15:36.762 --> 00:15:38.095
She adored him.

402
00:15:38.096 --> 00:15:39.097
I was, "How come"

403
00:15:39.098 --> 00:15:40.098
you couldn't talk?"

404
00:15:40.099 --> 00:15:41.892
- He said, "André,"
- it was Mrs. Vreeland.


405
00:15:41.895 --> 00:15:43.456
I was just absolutely petrified

406
00:15:43.457 --> 00:15:45.019
and mesmerized by her vision.

407
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.604
What she looked like

408
00:15:46.605 --> 00:15:48.188
"and everything."

409
00:15:48.189 --> 00:15:49.816
She said, "He showed me"

410
00:15:49.817 --> 00:15:51.442
"his portfolio." And I said:

411
00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:53.862
"Two shoes."

412
00:15:55.238 --> 00:15:56.656
That was, you know,

413
00:15:56.657 --> 00:15:58.073
a key moment for Manolo,

414
00:15:58.074 --> 00:15:59.366
that she really said:

415
00:15:59.367 --> 00:16:00.639
"You know,

416
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:01.911
concentrate on the shoes."

417
00:16:01.912 --> 00:16:03.163
And it was such a...

418
00:16:03.164 --> 00:16:04.414
The right move.

419
00:16:07.876 --> 00:16:09.044
And from there

420
00:16:09.045 --> 00:16:10.211
becomes Manolo Blahnik.

421
00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:32.564
I started to meet people,

422
00:17:32.565 --> 00:17:35.045
uh, Chelita, Ossie.

423
00:17:35.046 --> 00:17:37.048
- All these people,
- that they were doing things.


424
00:17:42.345 --> 00:17:43.929
Wonderful Chelita Secunda,

425
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.223
which she was like

426
00:17:45.224 --> 00:17:46.515
assistant to Ossie Clark,

427
00:17:46.516 --> 00:17:48.081
asked me to do

428
00:17:48.082 --> 00:17:49.643
this collection

429
00:17:49.644 --> 00:17:51.125
that could have been the end

430
00:17:51.126 --> 00:17:52.605
of my career totally.

431
00:17:53.774 --> 00:17:54.921
I didn't know much

432
00:17:54.922 --> 00:17:56.066
about shoes anyway.

433
00:17:56.067 --> 00:17:57.944
So I did it, I did kind of

434
00:17:57.945 --> 00:17:59.820
a thought, "How wonderful."

435
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:01.093
Rubber soles,

436
00:18:01.094 --> 00:18:02.364
heels of like...

437
00:18:02.365 --> 00:18:05.200
Big heels in rubber.

438
00:18:05.201 --> 00:18:06.912
And I forgot

439
00:18:06.913 --> 00:18:08.620
to put inside steel.

440
00:18:08.621 --> 00:18:10.082
And it was like:

441
00:18:10.083 --> 00:18:11.540
The girls were falling off.

442
00:18:11.541 --> 00:18:14.584
♪ You've taken everything ♪

443
00:18:14.585 --> 00:18:15.942
People thought it was like

444
00:18:15.943 --> 00:18:17.296
a new way of walking.

445
00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:19.216

All these people

448
00:18:22.282 --> 00:18:23.427
were there clapping.

449
00:18:23.428 --> 00:18:25.097
And it was a disaster for me.

450
00:18:25.098 --> 00:18:26.764
Anyway, you couldn't walk.

451
00:18:26.765 --> 00:18:28.725
- ♪ 'Cause I know
- What faith is ♪


452
00:18:28.728 --> 00:18:30.184
Wearing his first shoes,

453
00:18:30.185 --> 00:18:31.249
which were extremely

454
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.311
uncomfortable,

455
00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:33.729
but extremely beautiful.

456
00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.064
There's a French saying,

457
00:18:35.065 --> 00:18:36.900
- you have to suffer
- to be beautiful.


458
00:18:36.903 --> 00:18:38.276
And so I thought I should

459
00:18:38.277 --> 00:18:39.651
abide by this absolutely.

460
00:18:39.652 --> 00:18:41.884
So whatever it took...

461
00:18:41.885 --> 00:18:44.114
I was ready to go for it.

462
00:18:44.115 --> 00:18:45.763
So Manolo shoes, I walked

463
00:18:45.764 --> 00:18:47.409
for miles with Manolo shoes.

464
00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.058
And they were excruciating,

465
00:18:49.059 --> 00:18:50.705
but I felt so great.

466
00:18:50.706 --> 00:18:54.605

468
00:19:06.722 --> 00:19:07.765
I was thinking about

469
00:19:07.766 --> 00:19:08.806
how wonderful

470
00:19:08.807 --> 00:19:11.100
it used to be in the...

471
00:19:11.101 --> 00:19:12.415
In Cheyne Walk

472
00:19:12.416 --> 00:19:13.728
and all those people live there.

473
00:19:13.729 --> 00:19:15.396
- Oh, my God,
- everybody was there.


474
00:19:15.399 --> 00:19:17.023
- Bianca,
- even Marianne Faithfull,


475
00:19:17.026 --> 00:19:18.524
- In Portman Square,
- everything.


476
00:19:18.527 --> 00:19:19.630
Chelsea was like

477
00:19:19.631 --> 00:19:20.735
a village, you see.

478
00:19:20.736 --> 00:19:21.966
Bianca rejecting

479
00:19:21.967 --> 00:19:23.195
bottle after bottle

480
00:19:23.196 --> 00:19:24.218
of perfectly good

481
00:19:24.219 --> 00:19:25.239
Chateau wine.

482
00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.679
Madame's been

483
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.117
very difficult today.

484
00:19:28.118 --> 00:19:29.432
You spent the day

485
00:19:29.433 --> 00:19:30.745
talking to Bianca,

486
00:19:30.746 --> 00:19:32.268
but most of the time

487
00:19:32.269 --> 00:19:33.789
she was busy combing her hair

488
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.479
or just procrastinating

489
00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.167
over her clothes, and...

490
00:19:37.168 --> 00:19:38.336
Or her shoes.

491
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:43.717
She was divine, though.

492
00:19:43.718 --> 00:19:44.842
You can wait for her

493
00:19:44.843 --> 00:19:46.010
because she was like a...

494
00:19:46.011 --> 00:19:47.075
She had this

495
00:19:47.076 --> 00:19:48.137
incredible magnetism.

496
00:19:48.138 --> 00:19:49.953
He would go to her house

497
00:19:49.954 --> 00:19:51.766
in Cheyne Walk.

498
00:19:51.767 --> 00:19:53.122
And she was

499
00:19:53.123 --> 00:19:54.476
part of that scene.

500
00:19:54.477 --> 00:19:56.104
- He was part
- of that decorative,


501
00:19:56.107 --> 00:19:57.501
Glamorous,

502
00:19:57.502 --> 00:19:58.899
English, London scene.

503
00:20:08.825 --> 00:20:11.744
I was so young, 23 or 24.

504
00:20:11.745 --> 00:20:13.371
So long ago.

505
00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.562
I have a big poppy

506
00:20:16.563 --> 00:20:17.833
back then.

507
00:20:17.834 --> 00:20:19.690
I didn't have one white hair.

508
00:20:19.691 --> 00:20:21.545
This is tremendous.

509
00:20:21.546 --> 00:20:23.006
- This is like
- one of those nice...


510
00:20:23.009 --> 00:20:24.800
- We did have - wonderful times.

511
00:20:26.968 --> 00:20:28.636
Oh, she was beautiful.

512
00:20:40.231 --> 00:20:41.900
Ah, the Queen Christina

513
00:20:41.901 --> 00:20:43.567
was a failure.

514
00:20:43.568 --> 00:20:44.861
Look at that.

515
00:20:46.071 --> 00:20:47.823
Oh, Jade.

516
00:20:47.824 --> 00:20:49.574
As a nanny, I was divine.

517
00:20:50.701 --> 00:20:52.159
No, I wasn't.

518
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.349
I look like a sort of

519
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.537
Romanian hustler.

520
00:21:00.376 --> 00:21:01.627
Yeah, a kaftan

521
00:21:01.628 --> 00:21:02.878
that I got in Tang...

522
00:21:02.879 --> 00:21:03.921
No, in Fez.

523
00:21:03.922 --> 00:21:05.547
Ooh!

524
00:21:05.548 --> 00:21:07.571
This is two oranges

525
00:21:07.572 --> 00:21:09.594
and a flower and a bump out.

526
00:21:11.096 --> 00:21:12.931
I was a little bit down, yeah.

527
00:21:12.932 --> 00:21:14.766
The oranges were down.

528
00:21:17.602 --> 00:21:18.875
I never liked very much

529
00:21:18.876 --> 00:21:20.145
after that period.

530
00:21:20.146 --> 00:21:22.107
- I never dressed up
- or things like that.


531
00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:23.296
Isn't it funny?

532
00:21:23.297 --> 00:21:24.483
Very old-fashioned now.

533
00:21:24.484 --> 00:21:25.819
But I did have a wonderful time

534
00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.153
when I was young.

535
00:21:40.375 --> 00:21:41.459
I'm gonna do one of those

536
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.542
kind of shoes

537
00:21:42.543 --> 00:21:44.316
that they wear

538
00:21:44.317 --> 00:21:46.088
in the court of Cyrus.

539
00:21:46.089 --> 00:21:48.382
With things going up the leg.

540
00:21:48.383 --> 00:21:49.927
The great joy

541
00:21:49.928 --> 00:21:51.468
was sitting in his study

542
00:21:51.469 --> 00:21:54.221
whilst he drew shoes.

543
00:21:54.222 --> 00:21:56.058
He'd get a piece of paper

544
00:21:56.059 --> 00:21:57.893
and he'd start telling a story.

545
00:21:58.852 --> 00:22:00.936
Coral here.

546
00:22:00.937 --> 00:22:02.188
Emerald.

547
00:22:02.189 --> 00:22:03.438
I'm gonna do a beautiful shoe.

548
00:22:03.439 --> 00:22:04.962
Emerald. And this one,

549
00:22:04.963 --> 00:22:06.483
something else.

550
00:22:06.484 --> 00:22:08.862
Mm... Ooh! I love that one.

551
00:22:11.406 --> 00:22:13.324
- It's not gonna be
- very commercial.


552
00:22:13.327 --> 00:22:15.118
Manolo, his drawings,

553
00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:16.911
when you see the energy he puts

554
00:22:16.912 --> 00:22:18.538
- in the line of a drawing
- for a shoe,


555
00:22:18.541 --> 00:22:19.955
It's masterful.

556
00:22:19.956 --> 00:22:21.020
The energy from the hand

557
00:22:21.021 --> 00:22:22.082
to the drawing,

558
00:22:22.083 --> 00:22:24.001
to the splash of color,

559
00:22:24.002 --> 00:22:25.294
it's just extraordinary.

560
00:22:25.295 --> 00:22:26.922
I've seen that

561
00:22:26.923 --> 00:22:28.547
very rarely in designers.

562
00:22:28.548 --> 00:22:29.966
Maybe Yves Saint Laurent.

563
00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.136
It's gonna be

564
00:22:33.137 --> 00:22:34.511
in titanium or maybe...

565
00:22:34.512 --> 00:22:36.703
No. Steel, but aluminum

566
00:22:36.704 --> 00:22:38.892
will... Pfft... break.

567
00:22:41.853 --> 00:22:43.084
So everything

568
00:22:43.085 --> 00:22:44.313
comes out of your head?

569
00:22:44.314 --> 00:22:45.940
More or less, yes.

570
00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:47.316
Yes.

571
00:22:47.317 --> 00:22:48.318
And it's a lot of stuff,

572
00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:49.319
I presume?

573
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.569
I mean, it's a lot of stuff...

574
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.071
Yes, but I don't have...

575
00:22:52.072 --> 00:22:53.594
I never have problems

576
00:22:53.595 --> 00:22:55.115
about having a lot of stuff.

577
00:22:55.116 --> 00:22:56.785
- Block.
- I like... A block?


578
00:22:56.788 --> 00:22:58.161
I've never had a block.

579
00:22:58.162 --> 00:22:59.536
Now, that one thing...

580
00:22:59.537 --> 00:23:01.102
Sounds presumptuous and pompous,

581
00:23:01.103 --> 00:23:02.665
but I never had blocks.

582
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.315
I don't know what it is.

583
00:23:06.316 --> 00:23:08.378
This is medallions or...

584
00:23:08.379 --> 00:23:09.672
Could be floral like that,

585
00:23:09.673 --> 00:23:10.965
but it's not floral.

586
00:23:10.966 --> 00:23:12.592
It's jewels.

587
00:23:14.469 --> 00:23:16.200
Sometimes I'm really happy

588
00:23:16.201 --> 00:23:17.930
that I create this by myself

589
00:23:17.931 --> 00:23:19.725
- because in my time,
- there was nobody


590
00:23:19.728 --> 00:23:21.351
- Doing designer shoes
- like this.


591
00:23:21.354 --> 00:23:23.061
It's not profitable.

592
00:23:30.151 --> 00:23:32.445
All fashion was about escapism

593
00:23:32.446 --> 00:23:34.740
and fantasy, pure escapism.

594
00:23:36.657 --> 00:23:38.264
This is why I think

595
00:23:38.265 --> 00:23:39.869
he created this environment

596
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.620
for people to shop in

597
00:23:41.621 --> 00:23:42.873
because it took you

598
00:23:42.874 --> 00:23:44.124
into another world.

599
00:23:50.671 --> 00:23:52.965
I met Manolo in the shop.

600
00:23:52.966 --> 00:23:54.280
I was friends with Bianca Jagger

601
00:23:54.281 --> 00:23:55.592
at the time.

602
00:23:55.593 --> 00:23:57.219
I was her new friend.

603
00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.555
I lived in her pocket.

604
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.311
And the whole thing was like

605
00:24:04.312 --> 00:24:06.271
going to a circus in a way.

606
00:24:11.109 --> 00:24:13.403
At a certain point

607
00:24:13.404 --> 00:24:15.695
I bought a pair of Manolo shoes.

608
00:24:15.696 --> 00:24:18.700
Zebra skin pumps.

609
00:24:21.286 --> 00:24:22.703
His men's shoes,

610
00:24:22.704 --> 00:24:23.705
well, they're just

611
00:24:23.706 --> 00:24:24.706
kind of slightly...

612
00:24:24.707 --> 00:24:26.896
more feminine versions

613
00:24:26.897 --> 00:24:29.085
of the women's shoes.

614
00:24:30.712 --> 00:24:32.505
- I've still got them
- upstairs at home.


615
00:24:32.508 --> 00:24:33.757
I've never worn them.

616
00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:41.096
When I moved back to London,

617
00:24:41.097 --> 00:24:42.369
I had just had my first child,

618
00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:43.640
and he was tiny,

619
00:24:43.641 --> 00:24:45.100
and I was alone in London

620
00:24:45.101 --> 00:24:46.269
and really didn't

621
00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.436
know many people.

622
00:24:47.437 --> 00:24:48.877
And I used to go on Saturday

623
00:24:48.878 --> 00:24:50.314
mornings to the shop,

624
00:24:50.315 --> 00:24:52.025
with Charlie,

625
00:24:52.026 --> 00:24:53.734
who was crawling around and...

626
00:24:53.735 --> 00:24:54.985
Just to see Manolo

627
00:24:54.986 --> 00:24:56.821
because he was so...

628
00:24:56.822 --> 00:24:58.302
enchanting

629
00:24:58.303 --> 00:24:59.782
and welcoming, and lovely,

630
00:24:59.783 --> 00:25:00.930
and didn't mind

631
00:25:00.931 --> 00:25:02.076
that Charlie knocked over

632
00:25:02.077 --> 00:25:04.119
all the shoe displays.

633
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:05.893
And he was always there.

634
00:25:05.894 --> 00:25:07.664
He was never not in the shop.

635
00:25:07.665 --> 00:25:08.771
It just sort of made you

636
00:25:08.772 --> 00:25:09.876
feel loved.

637
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:13.985
I remember going into Manolo's

638
00:25:13.986 --> 00:25:16.298
shop for the first time

639
00:25:16.299 --> 00:25:17.675
and trying on

640
00:25:17.676 --> 00:25:19.052
a pair of shoes.

641
00:25:22.263 --> 00:25:23.369
A little bit

642
00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:24.473
like the ugly sister

643
00:25:24.474 --> 00:25:25.642
trying to get

644
00:25:25.643 --> 00:25:26.809
into the glass slipper,

645
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:28.103
'cause Manolo went...

646
00:25:30.313 --> 00:25:31.627
"Your feet, they're like

647
00:25:31.628 --> 00:25:32.941
peasant's feet."

648
00:25:37.863 --> 00:25:39.279
I decided I was going to buy

649
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.594
my first pair of Manolos

650
00:25:40.595 --> 00:25:41.907
in 1980.

651
00:25:41.908 --> 00:25:43.909
I bought them in the shop.

652
00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:45.578
I was obviously very into Manolo

653
00:25:45.579 --> 00:25:47.247
Blahnik shoes before then.

654
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.291
They asked me if I'd like

655
00:25:50.292 --> 00:25:51.541
to come and work here.

656
00:25:51.542 --> 00:25:53.294
- So of course I would jump
- at the chance


657
00:25:53.297 --> 00:25:54.795
Of coming to work here.

658
00:25:54.796 --> 00:25:56.547
- And it's my idea of heaven
- working here,


659
00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.237
Being around all these shoes

660
00:25:58.238 --> 00:25:59.926
that I love so much.

661
00:26:11.813 --> 00:26:13.774
- There was, like, a little part
- of me that said,


662
00:26:13.777 --> 00:26:15.400
"Well, perhaps he's a poseur,"

663
00:26:15.401 --> 00:26:17.026
you know?

664
00:26:17.027 --> 00:26:18.528
But then I realized

665
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:20.029
that everything that he did

666
00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.114
was to do with expressing

667
00:26:21.115 --> 00:26:22.197
himself.

668
00:26:22.198 --> 00:26:24.450
It was really only

669
00:26:24.451 --> 00:26:26.702
from his interest and passion,

670
00:26:26.703 --> 00:26:28.059
you know, that he dressed

671
00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:29.413
like that.

672
00:26:29.414 --> 00:26:30.498
He didn't look like

673
00:26:30.499 --> 00:26:31.581
anybody else at the time

674
00:26:31.582 --> 00:26:33.043
because it was

675
00:26:33.044 --> 00:26:34.501
the time of hippies,

676
00:26:34.502 --> 00:26:35.921
- and it was the time of,
- you know,


677
00:26:35.924 --> 00:26:37.443
People just wearing

678
00:26:37.444 --> 00:26:38.964
very relaxed clothes.

679
00:26:38.965 --> 00:26:40.487
And there he was,

680
00:26:40.488 --> 00:26:42.009
like a creature

681
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.074
from a completely

682
00:26:43.075 --> 00:26:44.136
different century.

683
00:26:44.137 --> 00:26:45.764
Manolo would fit

684
00:26:45.765 --> 00:26:47.389
into any century

685
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.852
from the 15th

686
00:26:49.853 --> 00:26:52.311
up to the beginning of the 19th.

687
00:26:52.312 --> 00:26:53.877
He constantly references

688
00:26:53.878 --> 00:26:55.439
Il Gattopardo and Sicilian...

689
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.441
He knows about

690
00:26:56.442 --> 00:26:57.442
the Sicilian nobles.

691
00:26:57.443 --> 00:26:59.068
He knows about the clothes.

692
00:26:59.069 --> 00:27:00.341
It's very rare to see

693
00:27:00.342 --> 00:27:01.611
a younger person

694
00:27:01.612 --> 00:27:03.928
dressing as a 17th century

695
00:27:03.929 --> 00:27:06.241
Sicilian gentleman.

696
00:27:06.242 --> 00:27:07.264
And he's a vision

697
00:27:07.265 --> 00:27:08.285
in his beautiful suits.

698
00:27:08.286 --> 00:27:10.351
How does he get those tailors

699
00:27:10.352 --> 00:27:12.414
to make those wonderful colors?

700
00:27:12.415 --> 00:27:14.291
The perfection.

701
00:27:14.292 --> 00:27:15.543
Absolutely

702
00:27:15.544 --> 00:27:16.794
well-tailored clothes,

703
00:27:16.795 --> 00:27:18.275
hair that's always pulled back.

704
00:27:18.276 --> 00:27:19.755
He was very chic.

705
00:27:19.756 --> 00:27:21.779
This sort of elegant...

706
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.801
sort of bit like Tom Ford.

707
00:27:23.802 --> 00:27:25.345
That kind of elegance.

708
00:27:28.849 --> 00:27:30.017
First man on the cover

709
00:27:30.018 --> 00:27:31.183
of British Vogue.

710
00:27:31.184 --> 00:27:32.373
This is a testament

711
00:27:32.374 --> 00:27:33.561
to his style.

712
00:27:34.771 --> 00:27:36.481
- That was the moment
- that Manolo...


713
00:27:36.484 --> 00:27:37.649
Actually, he was

714
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:38.816
rather sexy.

715
00:27:38.817 --> 00:27:39.943
I mean, he was a very sexy

716
00:27:39.944 --> 00:27:41.069
young man.

717
00:27:43.822 --> 00:27:45.720
When we did that shoot,

718
00:27:45.721 --> 00:27:47.616
I wanted to use Manolo as a...

719
00:27:47.617 --> 00:27:49.036
As a sort of model,

720
00:27:49.037 --> 00:27:50.453
which he wasn't too keen about.

721
00:27:51.662 --> 00:27:53.247
Bailey introduced us.

722
00:27:53.248 --> 00:27:54.249
And Bailey was just crazy

723
00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:55.250
about Manolo.

724
00:27:55.251 --> 00:27:56.293
He said, "You're gonna"

725
00:27:56.294 --> 00:27:57.334
love him."

726
00:27:57.335 --> 00:27:59.336
And Manolo came in,

727
00:27:59.337 --> 00:28:00.839
he was very light

728
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.339
in his loafers.

729
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.863
He practically danced

730
00:28:03.864 --> 00:28:05.384
into the studio.

731
00:28:05.385 --> 00:28:07.012
And he had that very

732
00:28:07.013 --> 00:28:08.637
high-pitched voice.

733
00:28:08.638 --> 00:28:11.662
Then we end up on a trip to

734
00:28:11.663 --> 00:28:14.684
the Mediterranean and Corsica.

735
00:28:14.685 --> 00:28:16.604
And we become friends.

736
00:28:18.774 --> 00:28:20.734
- We land in Corsica
- and there was a...


737
00:28:20.737 --> 00:28:22.610
- Some demonstrations
- going off.


738
00:28:22.613 --> 00:28:24.029
There was lots

739
00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:25.445
of shooting and banging and...

740
00:28:25.446 --> 00:28:26.739
So it started off good.

741
00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.449
- I thought, "This is gonna
- be a good trip."


742
00:28:28.452 --> 00:28:29.867
And there were things

743
00:28:29.868 --> 00:28:31.536
that he absolutely

744
00:28:31.537 --> 00:28:33.203
hated doing.

745
00:28:33.204 --> 00:28:34.226
He was so difficult,

746
00:28:34.227 --> 00:28:35.247
I can't tell you.

747
00:28:35.248 --> 00:28:36.333
He was...

748
00:28:36.334 --> 00:28:37.416
He was appalling.

749
00:28:37.417 --> 00:28:39.084
Getting buried in the sand,

750
00:28:39.085 --> 00:28:40.879
I remember a huge tantrum

751
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.671
around that.

752
00:28:42.672 --> 00:28:44.174
"I won't be buried in the sand

753
00:28:44.175 --> 00:28:45.674
unless you bury yourself."

754
00:28:45.675 --> 00:28:47.552
- So I have to be buried
- up to my head in the sand


755
00:28:47.555 --> 00:28:49.178
So that Manolo would do it.

756
00:28:49.179 --> 00:28:50.846
He was squawking like a parrot,

757
00:28:50.847 --> 00:28:52.036
saying, "Let me out!"

758
00:28:52.037 --> 00:28:53.224
Let me out!"

759
00:28:55.101 --> 00:28:56.311
No, no, I'm not

760
00:28:56.312 --> 00:28:57.519
a very easy person.

761
00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:58.563
What do you mean, fussy?

762
00:28:58.564 --> 00:28:59.604
I'm difficult, yes.

763
00:28:59.605 --> 00:29:00.753
When I don't like something,

764
00:29:00.754 --> 00:29:01.899
I just give hell.

765
00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.526
And halfway through,

766
00:29:03.527 --> 00:29:05.152
I was thinking,

767
00:29:05.153 --> 00:29:07.197
"Maybe I made a mistake."

768
00:29:08.782 --> 00:29:10.137
Maybe I should have got

769
00:29:10.138 --> 00:29:11.492
"James Dean or somebody easy."

770
00:29:15.205 --> 00:29:16.664
Oh, he was a nightmare.

771
00:29:18.917 --> 00:29:20.439
The '70s were like

772
00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.961
a non-stop fun.

773
00:29:21.962 --> 00:29:23.881
The '80s are non-stop work,

774
00:29:23.882 --> 00:29:25.799
and then even more work.

775
00:29:29.094 --> 00:29:30.845
Though still a commoner,

776
00:29:30.846 --> 00:29:32.723
- the pretty English girl
- will be transformed


777
00:29:32.726 --> 00:29:33.787
Into the third lady

778
00:29:33.788 --> 00:29:34.849
of the realm,

779
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:36.225
Princess of Wales.

780
00:29:36.226 --> 00:29:37.977
Princess Diana came here

781
00:29:37.978 --> 00:29:39.562
- to buy herself
- a Christmas present.


782
00:29:39.565 --> 00:29:40.939
She was a flat shoe

783
00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:42.314
and low-heeled lady.

784
00:29:42.315 --> 00:29:43.942
'Cause she was so tall,

785
00:29:43.943 --> 00:29:45.568
it suited her look.

786
00:29:47.487 --> 00:29:49.030
- But she turned up
- at the Serpentine,


787
00:29:49.033 --> 00:29:50.552
Looking absolutely amazing

788
00:29:50.553 --> 00:29:52.074
and stunning,

789
00:29:52.075 --> 00:29:54.556
and blew everyone's breath away

790
00:29:54.557 --> 00:29:57.037
wearing a pair of Manolo heels.

791
00:29:57.038 --> 00:29:58.394
That's when we slowly started

792
00:29:58.395 --> 00:29:59.749
to become,

793
00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:01.209
like, a household name.

794
00:30:10.051 --> 00:30:13.721
The '80s was about excess.

795
00:30:13.722 --> 00:30:15.598
And Manolo's part of the great

796
00:30:15.599 --> 00:30:17.475
'80s in America.

797
00:30:24.482 --> 00:30:26.901
I was responsible for Manolo

798
00:30:26.902 --> 00:30:28.278
making the decision to go into

799
00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:29.653
business in America.

800
00:30:29.654 --> 00:30:31.406
He didn't have a clue.

801
00:30:33.324 --> 00:30:34.889
New York was really exciting.

802
00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:36.451
It was incredible.

803
00:30:36.452 --> 00:30:38.538
We started the shop in '83,

804
00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:40.622
and then it really took off.

805
00:30:40.623 --> 00:30:41.916
And that's how it was.

806
00:30:41.917 --> 00:30:42.960
It was this shop

807
00:30:42.961 --> 00:30:44.001
and the New York shop.

808
00:30:44.002 --> 00:30:45.879
And really,

809
00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.755
that was the empire then.

810
00:30:47.756 --> 00:30:49.717
It was introduction

811
00:30:49.718 --> 00:30:51.675
to another kind of culture,

812
00:30:51.676 --> 00:30:52.698
another kind

813
00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.719
of way of thinking,

814
00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.222
and a way of trying

815
00:30:56.223 --> 00:30:58.725
to please the buyer.

816
00:31:00.727 --> 00:31:02.020
When you walk down the street

817
00:31:02.021 --> 00:31:03.312
in New York City

818
00:31:03.313 --> 00:31:04.856
- and you see that women
- sort of like


819
00:31:04.859 --> 00:31:07.317
- Flash their hips a certain way,
- you know, it's...


820
00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.340
There's the longevity to that

821
00:31:09.341 --> 00:31:11.361
sexiness and style in America.

822
00:31:11.362 --> 00:31:12.864
And I think that Manolo,

823
00:31:12.865 --> 00:31:14.364
and what he does in his shoes,

824
00:31:14.365 --> 00:31:15.450
have always been very true

825
00:31:15.451 --> 00:31:16.533
to those themes.

826
00:31:16.534 --> 00:31:18.328
- And there was a time
- in the mid '80s


827
00:31:18.331 --> 00:31:20.205
- When there wasn't a designer
- on 7th Avenue


828
00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:22.373
- That didn't have Manolo Blahnik
- shoes on the runway.


829
00:31:22.376 --> 00:31:24.292
- It was a great time
- in the expansion


830
00:31:24.295 --> 00:31:25.711
Of what we did

831
00:31:25.712 --> 00:31:27.127
in America.

832
00:31:27.128 --> 00:31:28.463
And then suddenly I think

833
00:31:28.464 --> 00:31:29.797
that American Vogue decided,

834
00:31:29.798 --> 00:31:31.131
at a certain point,

835
00:31:31.132 --> 00:31:32.968
- "Well, why don't you
- go to Manolo?"


836
00:31:32.971 --> 00:31:34.323
When Anna was helping designers,

837
00:31:34.324 --> 00:31:35.677
she would say, "You need shoes."

838
00:31:35.678 --> 00:31:37.430
- And then they would go
- to Manolo, of course.


839
00:31:37.433 --> 00:31:40.058
We collaborated with a lot

840
00:31:40.059 --> 00:31:42.684
of designers in New York.

841
00:31:42.685 --> 00:31:43.729
Geoffrey Beene.

842
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:44.770
We're doing Bill Blass.

843
00:31:44.771 --> 00:31:46.606
- We're doing
- Oscar de la Renta.


844
00:31:46.609 --> 00:31:48.441
There was this long, long

845
00:31:48.442 --> 00:31:50.275
relationship with Calvin Klein.

846
00:31:50.276 --> 00:31:52.027
Calvin is totally American,

847
00:31:52.028 --> 00:31:53.696
and he gave to people

848
00:31:53.697 --> 00:31:55.364
what they want.

849
00:31:55.365 --> 00:31:56.700
I did ballerina shoes,

850
00:31:56.701 --> 00:31:58.034
and he was incredible.

851
00:32:01.705 --> 00:32:03.413
This season,

852
00:32:03.414 --> 00:32:04.832
New York's Isaac Mizrahi

853
00:32:04.833 --> 00:32:06.917
offers a cocktail of style.

854
00:32:06.918 --> 00:32:08.669
- I remember the best
- of collaborators,


855
00:32:08.672 --> 00:32:09.921
Isaac Mizrahi,

856
00:32:09.922 --> 00:32:11.171
the pilgrim buckle.

857
00:32:11.172 --> 00:32:14.258
Yes, that pilgrim mule.

858
00:32:14.259 --> 00:32:15.510
I was gonna kind of try

859
00:32:15.511 --> 00:32:16.761
to glamour it up

860
00:32:16.762 --> 00:32:18.470
as much as possible.

861
00:32:18.471 --> 00:32:19.576
And I gave him that buckle

862
00:32:19.577 --> 00:32:20.680
and I said,

863
00:32:20.681 --> 00:32:22.246
"I would like you to make"

864
00:32:22.247 --> 00:32:23.809
something with this buckle

865
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:25.937
to kind of say at once pilgrim

866
00:32:25.938 --> 00:32:28.063
"and sexy pilgrim."

867
00:32:28.064 --> 00:32:30.025
Right? And that's what

868
00:32:30.026 --> 00:32:31.984
he came up with.

869
00:32:31.985 --> 00:32:34.175
Manolo Blahnik shoes,

870
00:32:34.176 --> 00:32:36.363
as fearlessly sexy as they are,

871
00:32:36.364 --> 00:32:37.887
they're madly comfortable

872
00:32:37.888 --> 00:32:39.408
to a lot of women.

873
00:32:39.409 --> 00:32:40.951
My mother included.

874
00:32:40.952 --> 00:32:42.494
Even if it's that high a heel,

875
00:32:42.495 --> 00:32:43.871
it's still comfortable.

876
00:32:43.872 --> 00:32:44.957
I don't know

877
00:32:44.958 --> 00:32:46.041
how he does it.

878
00:32:51.087 --> 00:32:52.463
I'm sure of all

879
00:32:52.464 --> 00:32:53.839
the collaborations

880
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.862
that Manolo's worked with

881
00:32:54.863 --> 00:32:55.883
over the years,

882
00:32:55.884 --> 00:32:57.156
probably John would be

883
00:32:57.157 --> 00:32:58.427
the closest to him

884
00:32:58.428 --> 00:33:00.827
in terms of his spirit and his

885
00:33:00.828 --> 00:33:03.223
romanticism and his fantasy

886
00:33:03.224 --> 00:33:05.622
and his sort of...

887
00:33:05.623 --> 00:33:08.020
otherworldliness in a way.

888
00:33:08.021 --> 00:33:10.898
Aah! Aah!

889
00:33:10.899 --> 00:33:11.900
No idea. Did you hear

890
00:33:11.901 --> 00:33:12.901
what I was saying?

891
00:33:12.902 --> 00:33:14.234
No, I just walked in.

892
00:33:14.235 --> 00:33:15.736
Mwah.

893
00:33:15.737 --> 00:33:16.946
How are you?

894
00:33:16.947 --> 00:33:18.865
- I say talent
- has no barriers.


895
00:33:18.868 --> 00:33:20.616
- You look great.
- So do you.


896
00:33:20.619 --> 00:33:22.243
- Are you kidding?
- Magnifique.


897
00:33:23.536 --> 00:33:25.205
- But I'm interrupting.
- You carry on.


898
00:33:25.208 --> 00:33:26.663
No, you just made it.

899
00:33:26.664 --> 00:33:27.916
Am I saving you?

900
00:33:27.917 --> 00:33:29.166
You saved my life.

901
00:33:29.167 --> 00:33:30.543
When...

902
00:33:31.962 --> 00:33:33.880
John, um...

903
00:33:38.134 --> 00:33:40.241
John lost everything,

904
00:33:40.242 --> 00:33:42.346
and I think it was André

905
00:33:42.347 --> 00:33:44.808
that introduced him

906
00:33:44.809 --> 00:33:47.267
to an American banker,

907
00:33:47.268 --> 00:33:49.416
which then led to that amazing

908
00:33:49.417 --> 00:33:51.563
show in the Schlumberger.

909
00:33:51.564 --> 00:33:53.108
We'd gone to Paris thinking,

910
00:33:53.109 --> 00:33:54.649
"Where can we have the show?"

911
00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:57.277
Mona Bismarck Institute,

912
00:33:57.278 --> 00:33:58.843
all over the African...

913
00:33:58.844 --> 00:34:00.405
No, no, no.

914
00:34:00.406 --> 00:34:01.908
And so then I said, "Well, we"

915
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:03.408
can ask Madame Schlumberger."

916
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:04.452
We were just sitting

917
00:34:04.453 --> 00:34:05.494
on eggshells,

918
00:34:05.495 --> 00:34:07.121
waiting for her to say no.

919
00:34:07.122 --> 00:34:08.999
- And she said,
- "But of course."


920
00:34:09.002 --> 00:34:10.521
I'll just have to have

921
00:34:10.522 --> 00:34:12.043
"a little facelift for the show."

922
00:34:19.134 --> 00:34:20.260
Everything was donated.

923
00:34:20.261 --> 00:34:21.385
Everything was donated.

924
00:34:21.386 --> 00:34:22.720
The jewelers of Paris.

925
00:34:22.721 --> 00:34:23.972
Every supermodel modeled

926
00:34:23.973 --> 00:34:25.222
for nothing.

927
00:34:25.223 --> 00:34:27.371
Kate Moss, Naomi,

928
00:34:27.372 --> 00:34:29.518
Nadja Auermann. All of them.

929
00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:30.771
And then of course, there was

930
00:34:30.772 --> 00:34:32.021
Manolo with the shoes.

931
00:34:32.022 --> 00:34:33.981
And this was the moment of...

932
00:34:33.982 --> 00:34:35.337
Of John Galliano's

933
00:34:35.338 --> 00:34:36.691
big, big moment.

934
00:34:36.692 --> 00:34:37.882
It was a pivotal moment

935
00:34:37.883 --> 00:34:39.069
in fashion.

936
00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:40.321
It was just so magical

937
00:34:40.322 --> 00:34:41.571
and emotional

938
00:34:41.572 --> 00:34:43.054
and unlike anything

939
00:34:43.055 --> 00:34:44.533
anyone had ever seen.

940
00:34:44.534 --> 00:34:45.994
It is one of the most exciting

941
00:34:45.995 --> 00:34:47.452
things I've seen in my life,

942
00:34:47.453 --> 00:34:49.330
- in a beautiful
- 18th century house.


943
00:34:49.333 --> 00:34:50.832
And John really changed fashion

944
00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:52.333
with that show.

945
00:34:53.543 --> 00:34:55.169
It was extraordinary.

946
00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:56.818
Very limited amount of dresses,

947
00:34:56.819 --> 00:34:58.463
but beautiful.

948
00:34:58.464 --> 00:35:00.425
- It was the buzz, it was
- the buzz, it was the buzz.


949
00:35:00.428 --> 00:35:02.281
And always Manolo Blahnik,

950
00:35:02.282 --> 00:35:04.136
always Manolo Blahnik.

951

Always Manolo Blahnik.

You just gasped

953
00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.809
at the genius of it.

954
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:11.854
It will always be my favorite

955
00:35:11.855 --> 00:35:13.897
fashion show of all time.

956
00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:25.200
- Oh, Agatha.
- Agatha.


957
00:35:25.203 --> 00:35:26.222
Agatha. Agatha.

958
00:35:26.223 --> 00:35:27.242
Agatha.

959
00:35:27.243 --> 00:35:28.703
But gives less...

960
00:35:28.704 --> 00:35:29.747
That was a thing.

961
00:35:29.748 --> 00:35:30.788
This gave the attitude.

962
00:35:30.789 --> 00:35:32.457
- Agatha.
- That was Agatha.


963

- Look at her.
- And you remember that one?

00:35:34.128 --> 00:35:35.794
- You could - wear that now.

965
00:35:35.797 --> 00:35:37.628
- You can wear one now.
- Some girls do.


966
00:35:37.631 --> 00:35:39.276
These were worn in the

967
00:35:39.277 --> 00:35:40.923
São Schlumberger shows as well.

968

was colored in too.

- Darker. Probably not correct,

Different.

975

Yes.

You know that I tell the truth

978

all the time.

979
00:35:57.607 --> 00:35:59.463

Of course, I'd heard of

Manolo, the legend,

987
00:36:23.718 --> 00:36:25.009
And then I met you.

988
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.741
I wouldn't dare to come and meet

989
00:36:26.742 --> 00:36:28.470
such a legend as you. Stop.

990
00:36:28.471 --> 00:36:29.681

00:37:37.623 --> 00:37:39.208
He would go to an event,

1031
00:37:39.209 --> 00:37:40.919
- and everybody would have
- his shoes.


1032
00:37:46.174 --> 00:37:47.300
At the beginning,

1033
00:37:47.301 --> 00:37:48.425
it was like a surprise

1034
00:37:48.426 --> 00:37:49.677
to see all this hullabaloo

1035
00:37:49.678 --> 00:37:50.928
for just...

1036
00:37:50.929 --> 00:37:51.951
For myself.

1037
00:37:51.952 --> 00:37:52.973
I mean, I felt strange.

1038
00:37:57.894 --> 00:37:59.687
I'm not an actor,

1039
00:37:59.688 --> 00:38:01.480
a pop star or whatever it is,

1040
00:38:01.481 --> 00:38:03.066
but you have to perform,

1041
00:38:03.067 --> 00:38:04.649
you have to sell what you have.

1042
00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.298
What I do, what I have,

1043
00:38:06.299 --> 00:38:07.946
is shoes, so I have to sell it.

1044
00:38:11.407 --> 00:38:13.200
Madness of these women.

1045
00:38:13.201 --> 00:38:14.681
"When are you going to do it"

1046
00:38:14.682 --> 00:38:16.161
in another color?

1047
00:38:16.162 --> 00:38:17.706
I say, "We will. We will."

1048
00:38:27.382 --> 00:38:28.696
In a cross between Cinderella

1049
00:38:28.697 --> 00:38:30.009
and a white rabbit,

1050
00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.574
because Cinderella

1051
00:38:31.575 --> 00:38:33.137
got the shoes that fitted,

1052
00:38:33.138 --> 00:38:34.577
and Manolo's never stopped

1053
00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:36.016
running, like the white rabbit.

1054
00:38:38.601 --> 00:38:40.060
Yeah, he's got lots of rabbit.

1055
00:38:40.061 --> 00:38:42.188
- He even looks like a rabbit
- when he runs.


1056
00:38:54.284 --> 00:38:56.036
- Somehow, because
- of the world that...


1057
00:38:56.039 --> 00:38:58.038
- Particularly the world
- that we live in today,


1058
00:38:58.041 --> 00:38:59.915
- Myths are created
- around people


1059
00:38:59.918 --> 00:39:01.166
The way they have been

1060
00:39:01.167 --> 00:39:02.416
around Manolo.

1061
00:39:02.417 --> 00:39:03.877
And I think he doesn't really

1062
00:39:03.878 --> 00:39:05.335
know how to deal with it.

1063
00:39:05.336 --> 00:39:07.568
Never took seriously this thing.

1064
00:39:07.569 --> 00:39:09.799
I never had a kind of perception

1065
00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.572
what fame or whatever

1066
00:39:11.573 --> 00:39:13.343
or known is.

1067
00:39:13.344 --> 00:39:14.554
I can totally understand

1068
00:39:14.555 --> 00:39:15.763
if he's conflicted by fame,

1069
00:39:15.764 --> 00:39:16.786
but he has to remember

1070
00:39:16.787 --> 00:39:17.807
who his friends are,

1071
00:39:17.808 --> 00:39:19.017
who his real people are.

1072
00:39:25.231 --> 00:39:26.983
And, yes, it's fabulous

1073
00:39:26.984 --> 00:39:28.735
for business.

1074
00:39:30.195 --> 00:39:31.550
I promise in my whole life

1075
00:39:31.551 --> 00:39:32.905
I only wear Manolo.

1076
00:39:32.906 --> 00:39:35.324
Thank you. God bless you.

1077
00:39:35.325 --> 00:39:36.493
My factories

1078
00:39:36.494 --> 00:39:37.660
will be happy.

1079
00:39:42.373 --> 00:39:44.438
Fashion became really

1080
00:39:44.439 --> 00:39:46.501
schizophrenic in the '90s.

1081
00:39:46.502 --> 00:39:48.046
- One minute, - it's one thing,

1082
00:39:48.049 --> 00:39:49.756
- The next minute
- it's something else.


1083
00:39:49.759 --> 00:39:51.131
And it's all over the place.

1084
00:39:51.132 --> 00:39:52.342
And Manolo remained

1085
00:39:52.343 --> 00:39:53.550
a constant through it.

1086
00:39:53.551 --> 00:39:55.386
- Plus the exposure
- in Sex and the City,


1087
00:39:55.389 --> 00:39:56.993
Manolo became

1088
00:39:56.994 --> 00:39:58.597
unbelievably famous.

1089
00:39:58.598 --> 00:39:59.829
I took a wrong turn looking

1090
00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.058
for the right shoes,

1091
00:40:01.059 --> 00:40:02.769
- and somewhere south
- of Houston Street,


1092
00:40:02.772 --> 00:40:04.395
I quite literally

1093
00:40:04.396 --> 00:40:06.021
lost my direction.

1094
00:40:06.022 --> 00:40:07.315
Excuse me, sir.

1095
00:40:07.316 --> 00:40:08.607
I know this sounds ridiculous,

1096
00:40:08.608 --> 00:40:10.110
but can you tell me which way

1097
00:40:10.111 --> 00:40:11.610
is West Broadway?

1098
00:40:11.611 --> 00:40:12.945
Give me your bag.

1099
00:40:12.946 --> 00:40:14.364
- What?
- Your bag.


1100
00:40:16.032 --> 00:40:17.513
It's a Baguette.

1101
00:40:17.514 --> 00:40:18.993
Let me have it.

1102
00:40:18.994 --> 00:40:20.266
I couldn't believe it.

1103
00:40:20.267 --> 00:40:21.536
Fifteen years in New York,

1104
00:40:21.537 --> 00:40:23.414
- and just when the city
- was getting safe,


1105
00:40:23.417 --> 00:40:24.664
I was getting mugged.

1106
00:40:24.665 --> 00:40:26.166
And your Manolo Blahniks.

1107
00:40:26.167 --> 00:40:27.961
What?

1108
00:40:29.755 --> 00:40:31.547
- No.
- Give me the fucking Blahniks.


1109
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:33.049
These guys weren't

1110
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:34.549
just after money anymore.

1111
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:36.551
They were after fashion.

1112
00:40:36.552 --> 00:40:38.346
- Please, sir,
- they're my favorite pair.


1113
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:40.661
I get them half price at a...

1114
00:40:40.662 --> 00:40:42.975
At a sample sale.

1115
00:40:42.976 --> 00:40:44.559
Thanks.

1116
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.395
Oh! Oh!

1117
00:40:46.396 --> 00:40:48.899
Somebody... Somebody stop him!

1118
00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.400
He took my strappy sandals!

1119
00:40:51.401 --> 00:40:52.692
Oh! Please, somebody...

1120
00:40:52.693 --> 00:40:54.444
Ow!

1121
00:40:54.445 --> 00:40:55.781
Everybody's seen

1122
00:40:55.782 --> 00:40:57.114
Sex and the City.

1123
00:40:57.115 --> 00:40:58.595
Some people have seen

1124
00:40:58.596 --> 00:41:00.075
Marie Antoinette.

1125
00:41:00.076 --> 00:41:01.286
When we were working

1126
00:41:01.287 --> 00:41:02.494
on Marie Antoinette,

1127
00:41:02.495 --> 00:41:03.851
I was talking a lot

1128
00:41:03.852 --> 00:41:05.205
with the great Milena Canonero,

1129
00:41:05.206 --> 00:41:06.874
who did the costumes.

1130
00:41:06.875 --> 00:41:08.960
- And I thought of asking Manolo
- because I thought,


1131
00:41:08.963 --> 00:41:10.128
"Who would Marie Antoinette

1132
00:41:10.129 --> 00:41:11.295
ask to do her shoes?"

1133
00:41:11.296 --> 00:41:12.547
And she would have

1134
00:41:12.548 --> 00:41:13.799
asked Manolo.

1135
00:41:16.092 --> 00:41:17.593
I just knew that he has

1136
00:41:17.594 --> 00:41:19.095
a playful spirit.

1137
00:41:27.562 --> 00:41:28.856
He looked at the shoes

1138
00:41:28.857 --> 00:41:30.147
of Marie Antoinette,

1139
00:41:30.148 --> 00:41:32.629
and then tried to give them

1140
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.110
a modern slant.

1141
00:41:35.111 --> 00:41:36.988
- We didn't want it
- to feel dusty,


1142
00:41:36.991 --> 00:41:39.074
- And we didn't want it
- to feel like he pulled things


1143
00:41:39.077 --> 00:41:40.200
Out of the archives,

1144
00:41:40.201 --> 00:41:41.325
and they were all faded.

1145
00:41:41.326 --> 00:41:43.661
- Queuing up in Le Champs-Élysées
- to see the movie,


1146
00:41:43.664 --> 00:41:45.412
And I called Manolo.

1147
00:41:45.413 --> 00:41:46.978
I said, "Manolo, I'm going in"

1148
00:41:46.979 --> 00:41:48.540
to see Marie Antoinette."

1149
00:41:48.541 --> 00:41:50.210
And he said, "You must tell me"

1150
00:41:50.211 --> 00:41:51.877
what it's like."

1151
00:41:51.878 --> 00:41:53.546
And that first thing,

1152
00:41:53.547 --> 00:41:55.214
when you see Marie Antoinette...

1153
00:41:55.215 --> 00:41:56.299
The first thing you see

1154
00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.383
are Manolo's shoes.

1155
00:41:58.676 --> 00:41:59.677
She's losing herself

1156
00:41:59.678 --> 00:42:00.678
in shopping

1157
00:42:00.679 --> 00:42:02.159
to avoid her sad marriage

1158
00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:03.638
and being misunderstood.

1159
00:42:03.639 --> 00:42:04.912
Like a trophy wife

1160
00:42:04.913 --> 00:42:06.183
in Beverly Hills,

1161
00:42:06.184 --> 00:42:08.353
shopping for Manolos.

1162
00:42:11.022 --> 00:42:12.461
He did about 23 pairs

1163
00:42:12.462 --> 00:42:13.899
for the movie.

1164
00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:15.401
And he kept saying,

1165
00:42:15.402 --> 00:42:16.902
"You know, it's exhausting."

1166
00:42:16.903 --> 00:42:18.696
You can't know... You can't

1167
00:42:18.697 --> 00:42:20.489
imagine how difficult it is

1168
00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:22.325
"- to design - for the movies."

1169
00:42:31.292 --> 00:42:32.564
His shoes that he made for

1170
00:42:32.565 --> 00:42:33.836
Marie Antoinette, for example,

1171
00:42:33.837 --> 00:42:38.173
were amazing and very sexy.

1172
00:42:38.174 --> 00:42:39.739
Those ones with the big bows.

1173
00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.301
Very, very beautiful.

1174
00:42:41.302 --> 00:42:42.784
I remember we had so much fun

1175
00:42:42.785 --> 00:42:44.263
when the boxes all arrived.

1176
00:42:44.264 --> 00:42:45.598
And automatically,

1177
00:42:45.599 --> 00:42:46.932
a girl's blood pressure goes up

1178
00:42:46.933 --> 00:42:48.434
- when they see
- beautiful shoes.


1179
00:42:48.437 --> 00:42:49.601
So the energy was in the room

1180
00:42:49.602 --> 00:42:50.853
when we were filming that,

1181
00:42:50.854 --> 00:42:51.897
on a macaroon high

1182
00:42:51.898 --> 00:42:52.938
with shoes.

1183
00:42:52.939 --> 00:42:54.398
But yeah, I have to...

1184
00:42:54.399 --> 00:42:55.671
I have to track down

1185
00:42:55.672 --> 00:42:56.943
where those shoes are.

1186
00:42:58.569 --> 00:43:00.988
And the Oscar goes to...

1187
00:43:00.989 --> 00:43:02.428
Milena Canonero

1188
00:43:02.429 --> 00:43:03.867
for Marie Antoinette.

1189
00:43:07.578 --> 00:43:09.936
He's become a myth, but he still

1190
00:43:09.937 --> 00:43:12.292
needs to live a life.

1191
00:43:16.046 --> 00:43:17.798
He just wants to run back to

1192
00:43:17.799 --> 00:43:19.549
his house and shut himself in.

1193
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.511
His father liked a lot

1194
00:43:23.512 --> 00:43:25.012
the English culture.

1195
00:43:25.013 --> 00:43:27.203
That's why I think Manolo

1196
00:43:27.204 --> 00:43:29.391
has that connection,

1197
00:43:29.392 --> 00:43:30.602
that special connection

1198
00:43:30.603 --> 00:43:31.812
with England.

1199
00:43:33.354 --> 00:43:34.815
My love of England

1200
00:43:34.816 --> 00:43:36.273
began with Enid Blyton.

1201
00:43:36.274 --> 00:43:38.193
Eventually end up my mother

1202
00:43:38.194 --> 00:43:40.110
reading Little Dorrit,

1203
00:43:40.111 --> 00:43:42.238
which I was little Dorrit.

1204
00:43:54.167 --> 00:43:56.127
- Strikes me as a champagne
- kind of guy.


1205
00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:57.921
- We have fizz,
- not true champagne.


1206
00:43:57.924 --> 00:43:59.714
Okay.

1207
00:43:59.715 --> 00:44:01.632
Yeah, on the signing table.

1208
00:44:03.009 --> 00:44:04.177
And so Bath has had

1209
00:44:04.178 --> 00:44:05.344
a long heritage

1210
00:44:05.345 --> 00:44:07.262
as a very fashionable city.

1211
00:44:07.263 --> 00:44:08.932
It's amazing that you are here

1212
00:44:08.933 --> 00:44:10.599
and would like to call it home.

1213
00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.518
- What was it the first...
- This is my home, yes.


1214
00:44:12.521 --> 00:44:14.104
- Attracted you - to Bath?

1215
00:44:14.107 --> 00:44:16.189
- One of those things in life
- that happened to me,


1216
00:44:16.192 --> 00:44:18.315
Everything is accidental.

1217
00:44:18.316 --> 00:44:19.902
I got a house in 1981,

1218
00:44:19.903 --> 00:44:21.485
so that's it.

1219
00:44:21.486 --> 00:44:23.571
He went to live in one of those

1220
00:44:23.572 --> 00:44:25.656
crescent-terraced houses.

1221
00:44:27.492 --> 00:44:28.973
Beautiful, but very

1222
00:44:28.974 --> 00:44:30.452
sort of solitary.

1223
00:44:30.453 --> 00:44:31.663
And very lonely,

1224
00:44:31.664 --> 00:44:32.873
I would have thought.

1225
00:44:34.624 --> 00:44:35.793
But he did that

1226
00:44:35.794 --> 00:44:36.959
to really think

1227
00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.191
and to get into his imagination

1228
00:44:39.192 --> 00:44:41.422
and to start creating.

1229
00:44:45.676 --> 00:44:46.970
You had to show so much of

1230
00:44:46.971 --> 00:44:48.262
yourself that you were not sure

1231
00:44:48.263 --> 00:44:49.723
that the true self

1232
00:44:49.724 --> 00:44:51.182
was still inside.

1233
00:44:54.227 --> 00:44:55.833
For Manolo, who seemed

1234
00:44:55.834 --> 00:44:57.437
to be so outgoing,

1235
00:44:57.438 --> 00:44:59.900
suddenly, you felt

1236
00:44:59.901 --> 00:45:02.360
he had reached the limit.

1237
00:45:06.447 --> 00:45:09.867
We went last year to his house.

1238
00:45:09.868 --> 00:45:11.119
It had a Miss Havisham

1239
00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:12.369
quality to it,

1240
00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.247
because he doesn't really live

1241
00:45:14.248 --> 00:45:16.123
in that house.

1242
00:45:16.124 --> 00:45:17.417
It was kind of a passing through

1243
00:45:17.418 --> 00:45:18.710
type of thing.

1244
00:45:21.755 --> 00:45:23.965
He lives very much with work.

1245
00:45:29.888 --> 00:45:31.638
My window... And look outside.

1246
00:45:31.639 --> 00:45:33.640
Everything is beautiful.

1247
00:45:33.641 --> 00:45:35.017
Sometimes, on Sundays,

1248
00:45:35.018 --> 00:45:36.540
I walk up to the crescent

1249
00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:38.062
and back again,

1250
00:45:38.063 --> 00:45:39.731
- back and everything.
- I love that.


1251
00:45:39.734 --> 00:45:41.232
Your book is absolutely

1252
00:45:41.233 --> 00:45:42.733
incredible and it's...

1253
00:45:42.734 --> 00:45:45.070
- Do you like it? I'm so pleased.
- I'm really happy,


1254
00:45:45.073 --> 00:45:46.321
Because it took me

1255
00:45:46.322 --> 00:45:47.571
two bloody years to finish.

1256
00:45:47.572 --> 00:45:48.573
And everybody,

1257
00:45:48.574 --> 00:45:49.574
"No, no permission."

1258
00:45:49.575 --> 00:45:51.242
- Copyright here.
- Copyright there.


1259
00:45:51.245 --> 00:45:53.203
- Always difficult.
- It gave me goose bumps.


1260
00:45:53.206 --> 00:45:54.768
And to get the people in place,

1261
00:45:54.769 --> 00:45:56.330
it's not easy, let me tell you.

1262
00:45:56.331 --> 00:45:57.748
But I'm happy, yes,

1263
00:45:57.749 --> 00:45:58.896
because the pictures

1264
00:45:58.897 --> 00:46:00.042
of Mr. Roberts are divine.

1265
00:46:00.043 --> 00:46:01.398
And the pictures of Mr. Penn,

1266
00:46:01.399 --> 00:46:02.753
the pictures of Mr. Avedon.

1267
00:46:02.754 --> 00:46:04.777
The pictures of everybody,

1268
00:46:04.778 --> 00:46:06.799
they're fabulous. Bailey, even.

1269
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.801
He's a bit difficult.

1270
00:46:07.802 --> 00:46:08.802
Difficult?

1271
00:46:08.803 --> 00:46:10.511
- Who?
- Dave Bailey.


1272
00:46:10.514 --> 00:46:12.973
- Davey, I adore him
- more than anybody in the world.


1273
00:46:12.976 --> 00:46:15.057
But he's a difficult person.

1274
00:46:15.058 --> 00:46:17.392
Do you have a favorite chapter

1275
00:46:17.393 --> 00:46:18.499
or particular one image

1276
00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.603
from the book?

1277
00:46:19.604 --> 00:46:21.814
I adore Cecil Beaton,

1278
00:46:21.815 --> 00:46:23.212
because I grew up with those

1279
00:46:23.213 --> 00:46:24.608
images in my...

1280
00:46:24.609 --> 00:46:26.945
In my visage, my face.

1281
00:46:34.244 --> 00:46:36.121
Cecil was a real person

1282
00:46:36.122 --> 00:46:37.998
of the 20th century.

1283
00:46:39.457 --> 00:46:41.417
- I've been spoiled
- since a child,


1284
00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.419
- Seeing his images
- in magazines,


1285
00:46:43.422 --> 00:46:45.170
What he observe on people.

1286
00:46:45.171 --> 00:46:47.090
It was perfection, and he did

1287
00:46:47.091 --> 00:46:49.009
capture that perfection.

1288
00:46:51.803 --> 00:46:54.076
British Vogue asked Manolo to

1289
00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:56.348
choose his favorite photograph.

1290
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:58.748
He chose a still Cecil Beaton

1291
00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:01.145
did with Jean Shrimpton in '64.

1292
00:47:01.146 --> 00:47:02.272
This image impressed

1293
00:47:02.273 --> 00:47:03.397
on the young Manolo

1294
00:47:03.398 --> 00:47:05.379
this idea in fashion that by

1295
00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.359
fusing disparate elements,

1296
00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:08.611
you can create

1297
00:47:08.612 --> 00:47:09.863
something fresh.

1298
00:47:13.366 --> 00:47:15.848
I did have the privilege to...

1299
00:47:15.849 --> 00:47:18.328
to ask Mr. Beaton

1300
00:47:18.329 --> 00:47:20.123
- to do my campaign
- of drawings,


1301
00:47:20.126 --> 00:47:21.708
- Because I'm sick
- of my drawings now.


1302
00:47:21.711 --> 00:47:23.001
By then, I was exhausted

1303
00:47:23.002 --> 00:47:24.293
of drawings.

1304
00:47:24.294 --> 00:47:25.713
He did the advertising

1305
00:47:25.714 --> 00:47:27.129
for Manolo for Vogue

1306
00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.716
when he'd had a stroke and

1307
00:47:28.717 --> 00:47:30.300
couldn't use his right hand.

1308
00:47:31.927 --> 00:47:33.261
And more poignant

1309
00:47:33.262 --> 00:47:34.594
and heartbreaking,

1310
00:47:34.595 --> 00:47:35.617
because it was

1311
00:47:35.618 --> 00:47:36.638
near the end.

1312
00:47:36.639 --> 00:47:38.788
And there it is, and obviously

1313
00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:40.936
Manolo was hugely honored.

1314
00:47:44.355 --> 00:47:46.420
VTR 2621, "Beaton By Bailey."

1315
00:47:46.421 --> 00:47:48.483
Part one, take one.

1316
00:47:48.484 --> 00:47:50.028
What do you say to people

1317
00:47:50.029 --> 00:47:51.571
when you photograph them?

1318
00:47:52.781 --> 00:47:54.824
I coo like a bloody dove.

1319
00:47:54.825 --> 00:47:55.993
I say, "Oh, that's"

1320
00:47:55.994 --> 00:47:57.159
absolutely great.

1321
00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.453
"Oh, that's it."

1322
00:47:58.454 --> 00:47:59.745
Oh, that's marvelous.

1323
00:47:59.746 --> 00:48:01.539
- "Now we're really
- getting somewhere.


1324
00:48:01.542 --> 00:48:03.123
"Now we're cooking with gas."

1325
00:48:03.124 --> 00:48:04.960
Look at me, Cecil.

1326
00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:06.794
That's absolutely marvelous.

1327
00:48:06.795 --> 00:48:08.337
Impresioso.

1328
00:48:08.338 --> 00:48:09.422
Oh, good. Look at me.

1329
00:48:09.423 --> 00:48:10.505
Excellent.

1330
00:48:10.506 --> 00:48:11.883
- Mm, that's too coy.
- Good.


1331
00:48:11.886 --> 00:48:13.927
- I really can't go that far.
- Good.


1332
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:15.137
Can you coo some more?

1333
00:48:15.138 --> 00:48:16.345
Yes. All right?

1334
00:48:16.346 --> 00:48:17.389
In that film where

1335
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:18.430
I'm interviewing, I said,

1336
00:48:18.431 --> 00:48:20.015
"Are you vain?"

1337
00:48:20.016 --> 00:48:21.392
Am I vain?

1338
00:48:22.602 --> 00:48:24.103
Oh, no.

1339
00:48:24.104 --> 00:48:25.563
I mean, really,

1340
00:48:25.564 --> 00:48:27.022
the modest violet,

1341
00:48:27.023 --> 00:48:28.358
except I wouldn't like

1342
00:48:28.359 --> 00:48:29.691
to call myself a violet.

1343
00:48:29.692 --> 00:48:31.819
"Am I conceited?"

1344
00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.031
"Am I vain?" Cecil.

1345
00:48:34.032 --> 00:48:36.241
Heh-heh-heh.

1346
00:48:37.826 --> 00:48:40.911
All that veneer of imperiousness

1347
00:48:40.912 --> 00:48:43.602
and kind of gâtée,

1348
00:48:43.603 --> 00:48:46.292
spoiled person he was...

1349
00:48:47.753 --> 00:48:49.317
touched me somehow.

1350
00:48:49.318 --> 00:48:50.880
I liked him so much, really.

1351
00:48:50.881 --> 00:48:52.758
They have a good gardener here,

1352
00:48:52.759 --> 00:48:54.633
somebody good. 
Don't you think?

1353
00:48:54.634 --> 00:48:55.885
Oh!

1354
00:48:55.886 --> 00:48:57.594
I have every single article,

1355
00:48:57.595 --> 00:48:59.618
every single drawing

1356
00:48:59.619 --> 00:49:01.640
that he did for Vogue.

1357
00:49:01.641 --> 00:49:02.893
Every single thing.

1358
00:49:09.775 --> 00:49:11.735
The only quality that I just

1359
00:49:11.736 --> 00:49:13.693
got in common with Cecil,

1360
00:49:13.694 --> 00:49:15.843
this kind of fantasy

1361
00:49:15.844 --> 00:49:17.991
about novelesque type of...

1362
00:49:19.284 --> 00:49:21.411
- excitement in the things
- that he did.


1363
00:49:21.414 --> 00:49:23.246
- And I have that, 
- I have...

1364
00:49:23.249 --> 00:49:24.560
I go... I go somewhere else.

1365
00:49:24.561 --> 00:49:25.873
I don't even know where.

1366
00:49:25.874 --> 00:49:27.980
You tell me to do something,

1367
00:49:27.981 --> 00:49:30.085
put me in front of a table

1368
00:49:30.086 --> 00:49:31.317
and say,

1369
00:49:31.318 --> 00:49:32.546
"Do this collection."

1370
00:49:32.547 --> 00:49:33.631
I do it.

1371
00:49:33.632 --> 00:49:34.715
I mean, without any...

1372
00:49:34.716 --> 00:49:35.988
It's because I have this kind

1373
00:49:35.989 --> 00:49:37.259
of thing I think he did have.

1374
00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.179
This kind of...

1375
00:49:41.389 --> 00:49:44.184
novel type of quality.

1376
00:49:51.107 --> 00:49:53.339
If I had to describe Manolo

1377
00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.569
as an animal,

1378
00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:57.135
he'd be a sort of

1379
00:49:57.136 --> 00:49:58.697
bird of paradise,

1380
00:49:58.698 --> 00:50:00.367
sort of displaying

1381
00:50:00.368 --> 00:50:02.034
its feathers.

1382
00:50:02.035 --> 00:50:03.787
And he'd probably have,

1383
00:50:03.788 --> 00:50:05.537
like, amazing claws

1384
00:50:05.538 --> 00:50:06.685
with sort of, like,

1385
00:50:06.686 --> 00:50:07.833
jeweled nails.

1386
00:50:10.251 --> 00:50:11.398
That thing that's

1387
00:50:11.399 --> 00:50:12.544
really so important

1388
00:50:12.545 --> 00:50:13.650
about a Manolo shoe

1389
00:50:13.651 --> 00:50:14.755
is you can dance,

1390
00:50:14.756 --> 00:50:15.987
you can move,

1391
00:50:15.988 --> 00:50:17.216
you can walk,

1392
00:50:17.217 --> 00:50:18.782
you can run, you can turn,

1393
00:50:18.783 --> 00:50:20.344
you can leap.

1394
00:50:20.345 --> 00:50:22.243
I always define beauty

1395
00:50:22.244 --> 00:50:24.139
as grace.

1396
00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.621
Manolo shoes always give you

1397
00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:27.102
the dance step.

1398
00:50:33.608 --> 00:50:35.610
I cannot tell you how much it

1399
00:50:35.611 --> 00:50:37.611
was a pleasure to do the book.

1400
00:50:37.612 --> 00:50:38.989
For instance,

1401
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:40.364
in del Prado, Madrid,

1402
00:50:40.365 --> 00:50:42.032
I had a wonderful time,

1403
00:50:42.033 --> 00:50:44.410
from 9 to 11, the whole museum

1404
00:50:44.411 --> 00:50:46.788
was for ourselves.

1405
00:50:52.127 --> 00:50:53.817
This museum, suddenly,

1406
00:50:53.818 --> 00:50:55.504
I've discovered one thing

1407
00:50:55.505 --> 00:50:56.756
because our new position,

1408
00:50:56.757 --> 00:50:58.048
I discovered the Velázquez,

1409
00:50:58.049 --> 00:50:59.926
and then in front of it,

1410
00:50:59.927 --> 00:51:01.802
the Goya one.

1411
00:51:01.803 --> 00:51:02.867
It was a surprise

1412
00:51:02.868 --> 00:51:03.929
for me to see

1413
00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:05.745
how he remember things

1414
00:51:05.746 --> 00:51:07.557
as they were years ago.

1415
00:51:07.558 --> 00:51:09.206
He said to me, "That was here",

1416
00:51:09.207 --> 00:51:10.853
that was there."

1417
00:51:10.854 --> 00:51:12.563
- I don't think
- there are many people


1418
00:51:12.566 --> 00:51:14.231
That remember that anymore.

1419
00:51:14.232 --> 00:51:15.421
You know?

1420
00:51:15.422 --> 00:51:16.609
He really knows the Prado.

1421
00:51:18.236 --> 00:51:19.237
I cannot compare

1422
00:51:19.238 --> 00:51:20.238
myself with Goya,

1423
00:51:20.239 --> 00:51:22.178
because Goya

1424
00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:24.116
is the king of shoes.

1425
00:51:24.117 --> 00:51:25.264
It were not only

1426
00:51:25.265 --> 00:51:26.410
just the shoes,

1427
00:51:26.411 --> 00:51:28.204
- but the structure
- of the shoes.


1428
00:51:28.207 --> 00:51:29.998
- And also the meaning
- of the shoes.


1429
00:51:30.001 --> 00:51:31.498
With a heel, you told me.

1430
00:51:31.499 --> 00:51:32.583
Yeah, with a heel:

1431
00:51:34.836 --> 00:51:36.004
You know, we're talking

1432
00:51:36.005 --> 00:51:37.171
about the shoes

1433
00:51:37.172 --> 00:51:38.881
of Maria Luisa de Parma.

1434
00:51:38.882 --> 00:51:39.987
She was...

1435
00:51:39.988 --> 00:51:41.091
She was mad for shoes.

1436
00:51:41.092 --> 00:51:42.177
Each painting

1437
00:51:42.178 --> 00:51:43.260
is so sensational.

1438
00:51:43.261 --> 00:51:44.742
The detail. You can

1439
00:51:44.743 --> 00:51:46.221
see the Ottoman de soie.

1440
00:51:46.222 --> 00:51:47.473
Okay.

1441
00:51:47.474 --> 00:51:48.724
All embroidery.

1442
00:51:48.725 --> 00:51:50.018
Yeah.

1443
00:51:50.019 --> 00:51:51.310
They're sensuous, by the way.

1444
00:51:51.311 --> 00:51:52.666
You wouldn't think so,

1445
00:51:52.667 --> 00:51:54.021
but they are.

1446
00:51:54.022 --> 00:51:55.294
It's important for

1447
00:51:55.295 --> 00:51:56.565
somebody like Manolo

1448
00:51:56.566 --> 00:51:57.922
to feed from all

1449
00:51:57.923 --> 00:51:59.276
the culture around him,

1450
00:51:59.277 --> 00:52:00.695
whether it's in The Prado

1451
00:52:00.696 --> 00:52:02.112
or maybe a building

1452
00:52:02.113 --> 00:52:03.823
that he sees in the street.

1453
00:52:03.824 --> 00:52:06.241
Everything comes into him,

1454
00:52:06.242 --> 00:52:07.890
then is re-worked without

1455
00:52:07.891 --> 00:52:09.536
him even thinking about it.

1456
00:52:09.537 --> 00:52:10.768
It's just how his work...

1457
00:52:10.769 --> 00:52:11.997
Mind works.

1458
00:52:11.998 --> 00:52:13.916
I think he's a hero.

1459
00:52:13.917 --> 00:52:15.918
In Spain, yes.

1460
00:52:15.919 --> 00:52:17.795
You know, the greatest.

1461
00:52:17.796 --> 00:52:19.630
- Well...
- Yeah.


1462
00:52:19.633 --> 00:52:21.132
I never had his shoes.

1463
00:52:22.718 --> 00:52:23.865
You haven't been to London

1464
00:52:23.866 --> 00:52:25.011
or traveled anywhere.

1465
00:52:31.434 --> 00:52:32.978
Manolo is one

1466
00:52:32.979 --> 00:52:34.519
of the three great celebrities

1467
00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.752
produced by Spain

1468
00:52:35.753 --> 00:52:36.982
in the 20th century.

1469
00:52:39.901 --> 00:52:41.152
Picasso and Almodóvar,

1470
00:52:41.153 --> 00:52:42.402
Pedro Almodóvar,

1471
00:52:42.403 --> 00:52:43.905
and Manolo Blahnik.

1472
00:52:45.573 --> 00:52:48.033
Manolo Blahnik.

1473
00:52:48.034 --> 00:52:49.744
The great philosophers say,

1474
00:52:49.745 --> 00:52:51.121
"If you want to be happy"

1475
00:52:51.122 --> 00:52:52.496
one day, have good food.

1476
00:52:52.497 --> 00:52:53.957
If you want to be happy

1477
00:52:53.958 --> 00:52:55.415
for a month, fall in love.

1478
00:52:55.416 --> 00:52:57.043
If you want to be happy

1479
00:52:57.044 --> 00:52:58.668
for the rest of your life,

1480
00:52:58.669 --> 00:53:00.379
"look after your garden."

1481
00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.298
- Is it true?
- Yeah, absolutely.


1482
00:53:09.097 --> 00:53:11.057
- The first things...
- The first thing


1483
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.392
I touched in life

1484
00:53:12.393 --> 00:53:13.726
were flowers.

1485
00:53:13.727 --> 00:53:17.230
I try very much to fulfill

1486
00:53:17.231 --> 00:53:20.733
my desires of being a gardener,

1487
00:53:20.734 --> 00:53:21.756
because I really achieved

1488
00:53:21.757 --> 00:53:22.778
it quite well.

1489
00:53:24.029 --> 00:53:25.822
- I was born in
- a banana plantation


1490
00:53:25.825 --> 00:53:26.886
And still love

1491
00:53:26.887 --> 00:53:27.948
that kind of monotony.

1492
00:53:27.949 --> 00:53:29.574
Bananas, bananas, bananas.

1493
00:53:29.575 --> 00:53:31.536
- Sugar cane, sugar cane,
- sugar cane.


1494
00:53:31.539 --> 00:53:34.039
And calla lilies, calla lilies,

1495
00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:36.540
calla lilies. And wisteria.

1496
00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:38.126
Oh, wisteria. Oh, I love

1497
00:53:38.127 --> 00:53:39.710
the name, first of all.

1498
00:53:39.711 --> 00:53:42.838
Wisteria. It's so Olympic.

1499
00:53:42.839 --> 00:53:44.320
It's so Hellenistic in a way,

1500
00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:45.800
but it isn't.

1501
00:53:45.801 --> 00:53:48.052
I love the smell.

1502
00:53:48.053 --> 00:53:49.722
Can have one and put it here,

1503
00:53:49.723 --> 00:53:51.388
and it'll be too much.

1504
00:53:51.389 --> 00:53:52.515
No, I don't want to do that.

1505
00:53:52.516 --> 00:53:53.640
I don't dare to cut it.

1506
00:53:53.641 --> 00:53:54.852
He's all the time

1507
00:53:54.853 --> 00:53:56.060
in the garden.

1508
00:53:56.061 --> 00:53:58.230
And all the plants, he's keep,

1509
00:53:58.231 --> 00:54:00.398
like, taking care of them.

1510
00:54:02.108 --> 00:54:03.902
- You think that
- it's not controlled,


1511
00:54:03.905 --> 00:54:05.235
But it's controlled.

1512
00:54:05.236 --> 00:54:06.737
He likes that.

1513
00:54:06.738 --> 00:54:08.803
Like the boots with the...

1514
00:54:08.804 --> 00:54:10.866
With the little laces,

1515
00:54:10.867 --> 00:54:12.994
yeah, going up.

1516
00:54:14.579 --> 00:54:16.123
That is the special thing

1517
00:54:16.124 --> 00:54:17.664
about being raised in some...

1518
00:54:17.665 --> 00:54:18.896
In a place like

1519
00:54:18.897 --> 00:54:20.125
the Canary Islands.

1520
00:54:20.126 --> 00:54:22.295
That you have to be

1521
00:54:22.296 --> 00:54:24.463
very close to nature,

1522
00:54:24.464 --> 00:54:25.590
and you have

1523
00:54:25.591 --> 00:54:26.716
to understand nature.

1524
00:54:26.717 --> 00:54:29.052
And you love nature.

1525
00:54:47.653 --> 00:54:49.322
I was born a few kilometers

1526
00:54:49.323 --> 00:54:50.990
from the coast of Africa.

1527
00:54:50.991 --> 00:54:52.574
Like I'm an African too,

1528
00:54:52.575 --> 00:54:54.265
because it's nothing

1529
00:54:54.266 --> 00:54:55.953
exotic or strange for me,

1530
00:54:55.954 --> 00:54:57.122
but it's beautiful.

1531
00:54:57.123 --> 00:54:58.289
That's all I see.

1532
00:55:00.375 --> 00:55:02.294
He's very attracted to that

1533
00:55:02.295 --> 00:55:04.211
Africa of the '30s and the '40s.

1534
00:55:04.212 --> 00:55:06.027
That was a very... Also a very

1535
00:55:06.028 --> 00:55:07.840
romantic kind of Africa.

1536
00:55:07.841 --> 00:55:09.030
Not... It's like

1537
00:55:09.031 --> 00:55:10.218
an idea of Africa.

1538
00:55:13.429 --> 00:55:15.098
Well, my Africa's not the Africa

1539
00:55:15.099 --> 00:55:16.767
of everybody, let me tell you.

1540
00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:30.301
He's always interpreted the most

1541
00:55:30.302 --> 00:55:32.281
extraordinary leopard motifs,

1542
00:55:32.282 --> 00:55:33.930
sandals,

1543
00:55:33.931 --> 00:55:35.575
raw materials from Africa.

1544
00:55:35.576 --> 00:55:37.308
Dark barks and beautiful skin

1545
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:39.038
stenciled as giraffe,

1546
00:55:39.039 --> 00:55:40.874
stenciled as wildebeest,

1547
00:55:40.875 --> 00:55:42.709
if there could be such a thing.

1548
00:55:44.169 --> 00:55:46.046
He recreates Africa

1549
00:55:46.047 --> 00:55:47.922
in his hands.

1550
00:55:47.923 --> 00:55:49.382
So that's why

1551
00:55:49.383 --> 00:55:50.841
he makes it so...

1552
00:55:50.842 --> 00:55:52.385
A new Africa,

1553
00:55:52.386 --> 00:55:53.929
a different Africa. His Africa.

1554
00:55:56.597 --> 00:55:58.516
He takes pieces of things, of

1555
00:55:58.517 --> 00:56:00.434
where inspiration comes from,

1556
00:56:00.435 --> 00:56:01.708
and elevates it so

1557
00:56:01.709 --> 00:56:02.978
that a modern woman

1558
00:56:02.979 --> 00:56:04.147
can actually incorporate

1559
00:56:04.148 --> 00:56:05.314
it in her life.

1560
00:56:05.315 --> 00:56:07.108
- Because a lot of the times,
- what I find


1561
00:56:07.111 --> 00:56:08.819
Is when people do

1562
00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:10.527
an homage to an African,

1563
00:56:10.528 --> 00:56:12.072
it becomes like something you

1564
00:56:12.073 --> 00:56:13.614
bought from a bazaar.

1565
00:56:16.743 --> 00:56:17.744
The Messiah collection

1566
00:56:17.745 --> 00:56:18.745
that he did for Dior,

1567
00:56:18.746 --> 00:56:20.496
you can still wear, you still

1568
00:56:20.497 --> 00:56:22.247
see the influences everywhere,

1569
00:56:22.248 --> 00:56:23.374
till today.

1570
00:56:28.922 --> 00:56:30.297
I get Africa from this shoe.

1571
00:56:30.298 --> 00:56:31.717
I can get Salvador,

1572
00:56:31.718 --> 00:56:33.133
I can get Africa.

1573
00:56:33.134 --> 00:56:34.634
I get Africa from the shoe,

1574
00:56:34.635 --> 00:56:36.325
but I consider Salvador

1575
00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:38.013
to be part of Africa.

1576
00:56:38.014 --> 00:56:39.871
Yeah, so I get

1577
00:56:39.872 --> 00:56:41.727
this shoe 110 percent.

1578
00:57:11.381 --> 00:57:13.466
McDOWELL:

1579
00:57:11.381 --> 00:57:15.550
enormously by Africa.

1580
00:57:13.467 --> 00:57:15.551
But his culture was influenced

1581
00:57:15.551 --> 00:57:16.720
He just found it

1582
00:57:16.721 --> 00:57:17.887
exciting and exotic,

1583
00:57:17.888 --> 00:57:19.431
which it clearly was

1584
00:57:19.432 --> 00:57:20.974
when he was a little boy.

1585
00:57:27.563 --> 00:57:28.689
There is no Manolo Blahnik,

1586
00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:29.815
it's Manolo.

1587
00:57:29.816 --> 00:57:31.358
Every woman knows it.

1588
00:57:31.359 --> 00:57:32.924
It has become part

1589
00:57:32.925 --> 00:57:34.487
of every woman's language.

1590
00:57:36.156 --> 00:57:37.574
And young girls... My daughter

1591
00:57:37.575 --> 00:57:38.992
knows what a Manolo is.

1592
00:57:47.751 --> 00:57:50.211
- What do you hope
- people will take from the book?


1593
00:57:50.214 --> 00:57:52.088
- I was thinking
- at the beginning...


1594
00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:53.339
Maybe people don't even

1595
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:54.589
know these people,

1596
00:57:54.590 --> 00:57:56.259
and I thought it would be a

1597
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:57.927
good idea to have now the book,

1598
00:57:57.928 --> 00:57:59.219
so they can see.

1599
00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:00.346
Every one of those

1600
00:58:00.347 --> 00:58:01.471
people really evoke

1601
00:58:01.472 --> 00:58:03.016
a period of my youth,

1602
00:58:03.017 --> 00:58:04.558
my-my childhood, um,

1603
00:58:04.559 --> 00:58:06.290
later on, and they're always

1604
00:58:06.291 --> 00:58:08.021
inspiring me, even now.

1605
00:58:11.107 --> 00:58:12.734
I like free spirits.

1606
00:58:12.735 --> 00:58:14.360
This is what I really love.

1607
00:58:16.863 --> 00:58:18.573
These women who just,

1608
00:58:18.574 --> 00:58:20.282
like, did something for me,

1609
00:58:20.283 --> 00:58:22.786
I mean, they'd create

1610
00:58:22.787 --> 00:58:25.287
that excitement for me.

1611
00:58:25.288 --> 00:58:26.352
I never, ever, ever

1612
00:58:26.353 --> 00:58:27.414
replace them.

1613
00:58:27.415 --> 00:58:30.293
I never could just get out

1614
00:58:30.294 --> 00:58:33.171
of my mind, and this is sad.

1615
00:58:39.594 --> 00:58:41.764
Anna Piaggi's Italy,

1616
00:58:41.765 --> 00:58:43.931
I mean the whole of Europe.

1617
00:58:43.932 --> 00:58:45.830
Anna, I saw her,

1618
00:58:45.831 --> 00:58:47.727
and we click, and said hello.

1619
00:58:47.728 --> 00:58:49.729
We started to talk, we talk.

1620
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:51.210
We have been very good friends

1621
00:58:51.211 --> 00:58:52.690
for 45 years.

1622
00:58:54.985 --> 00:58:56.382
We did a wonderful ritual.

1623
00:58:56.383 --> 00:58:57.778
I love rituals.

1624
00:58:57.779 --> 00:58:59.405
Every Friday evening

1625
00:58:59.406 --> 00:59:01.031
at the terrazza in the hotel,

1626
00:59:01.032 --> 00:59:03.097
we had dinner and we'd never

1627
00:59:03.098 --> 00:59:05.160
talk about fashion.

1628
00:59:05.161 --> 00:59:07.330
She mixed Chanel with the most

1629
00:59:07.331 --> 00:59:09.498
trashy things in California.

1630
00:59:09.499 --> 00:59:10.542
She was never

1631
00:59:10.543 --> 00:59:11.583
appreciated in Italy

1632
00:59:11.584 --> 00:59:13.149
as much as

1633
00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:14.713
she should have been.

1634
00:59:27.433 --> 00:59:28.455
Isabella used to be,

1635
00:59:28.456 --> 00:59:29.476
like, on the telephone,

1636
00:59:29.477 --> 00:59:31.603
midnight, blah, blah, blah,

1637
00:59:31.604 --> 00:59:33.313
talking nonsense.

1638
00:59:33.314 --> 00:59:34.545
Like I always do, um,

1639
00:59:34.546 --> 00:59:35.775
but Isabella was special,

1640
00:59:35.776 --> 00:59:37.360
- because she was so
- inspiring.


1641
00:59:37.363 --> 00:59:39.466
She would send me

1642
00:59:39.467 --> 00:59:41.571
The Book of Curiosities

1643
00:59:41.572 --> 00:59:43.574
with the say,

1644
00:59:43.575 --> 00:59:45.575
"I hope you will enjoy this."

1645
00:59:45.576 --> 00:59:47.287
Darling Manolo, you know

1646
00:59:47.288 --> 00:59:48.996
"that I love you forever."

1647
00:59:48.997 --> 00:59:50.644
And I thought,

1648
00:59:50.645 --> 00:59:52.291
"Gosh, how frightening."

1649
00:59:52.292 --> 00:59:54.044
- She knew what
- I would love to do,


1650
00:59:54.047 --> 00:59:55.295
And she was one of

1651
00:59:55.296 --> 00:59:56.545
my favorite, favorite.

1652
00:59:56.546 --> 00:59:58.298
- I still miss her
- tremendously.


1653
00:59:58.301 --> 00:59:59.612
Up to the last minute,

1654
00:59:59.613 --> 01:00:00.926
I was doing shoes for her.

1655
01:00:12.771 --> 01:00:14.043
Tina Chow was,

1656
01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:15.314
like, the instrument

1657
01:00:15.315 --> 01:00:17.233
of my great inspiration.

1658
01:00:18.526 --> 01:00:20.153
Very few people

1659
01:00:20.154 --> 01:00:21.779
selected by this God

1660
01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:23.177
have been put on

1661
01:00:23.178 --> 01:00:24.573
this Earth to create

1662
01:00:24.574 --> 01:00:27.493
what she did create for me.

1663
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:31.581
So strong, the friendship

1664
01:00:31.582 --> 01:00:34.041
and the bond between one,

1665
01:00:34.042 --> 01:00:35.272
you know,

1666
01:00:35.273 --> 01:00:36.501
and then she was

1667
01:00:36.502 --> 01:00:39.276
this incredible taste

1668
01:00:39.277 --> 01:00:42.049
and elegance.

1669
01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:44.073
Not acquired, simply,

1670
01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:46.095
she was born with it.

1671
01:00:46.096 --> 01:00:48.536
And the way she moves,

1672
01:00:48.537 --> 01:00:50.975
I love this kind of movement.

1673
01:00:50.976 --> 01:00:52.331
It's like that

1674
01:00:52.332 --> 01:00:53.685
little girl Rihanna,

1675
01:00:53.686 --> 01:00:55.604
she's beautiful, the move,

1676
01:00:55.605 --> 01:00:56.815
and then Tina

1677
01:00:56.816 --> 01:00:58.024
had that magic also.

1678
01:01:07.408 --> 01:01:09.327
All the people who die

1679
01:01:09.328 --> 01:01:11.246
is always with me somehow.

1680
01:01:20.421 --> 01:01:21.589
I don't think he has

1681
01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:22.757
ever sought a relationship.

1682
01:01:22.758 --> 01:01:24.174
I don't think he has the time.

1683
01:01:24.175 --> 01:01:26.136
- I don't think he'd
- even have the patience.


1684
01:01:26.139 --> 01:01:27.512
I don't think that

1685
01:01:27.513 --> 01:01:28.888
anyone could be a partner,

1686
01:01:28.889 --> 01:01:30.555
because he's so refined.

1687
01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:32.099
I mean, there's so many, uh...

1688
01:01:32.100 --> 01:01:33.289
The colognes, the clothes,

1689
01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:34.476
the layers,

1690
01:01:34.477 --> 01:01:35.978
the linens, the colors.

1691
01:01:35.979 --> 01:01:37.439
The-the houses,

1692
01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.898
the pillows, the furniture,

1693
01:01:38.899 --> 01:01:40.775
the paintings, the walls.

1694
01:01:40.776 --> 01:01:42.235
The drapes.

1695
01:01:42.236 --> 01:01:43.693
The-the-the everything.

1696
01:01:43.694 --> 01:01:45.404
Live?

1697
01:01:45.405 --> 01:01:46.635
With my mother and father,

1698
01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:47.865
and my sister, and the people?

1699
01:01:47.866 --> 01:01:49.743
- No, no, no.

Like this woman I went to

1870
01:08:55.398 --> 01:08:57.627
in this big talk in Vogue.

1871
01:08:57.628 --> 01:08:59.068
She say, "Oh, my team",

1872
01:08:59.069 --> 01:09:00.505
my team."

1873
01:09:00.506 --> 01:09:01.966
I was so cross. I say:

1874
01:09:01.967 --> 01:09:03.260
"Well, how do you work

1875
01:09:03.261 --> 01:09:04.551
with teams? I mean... "

1876
01:09:04.552 --> 01:09:06.178
And she was not very happy.

1877
01:09:06.179 --> 01:09:07.744
Manolo cannot work with anyone.

1878
01:09:07.745 --> 01:09:09.306
Manolo can't listen.

1879
01:09:09.307 --> 01:09:11.141
I mean, you know, he doesn't.

1880
01:09:11.142 --> 01:09:13.894
He-he-he d... His mind races.

1881
01:09:13.895 --> 01:09:15.354
No, it's gonna fall.

1882
01:09:15.355 --> 01:09:16.795
This little whole

1883
01:09:16.796 --> 01:09:18.232
concept I'm not into.

1884
01:09:18.233 --> 01:09:19.777
You're not into it?

1885
01:09:19.778 --> 01:09:21.318
I'm so sorry, but I am.

1886
01:09:21.319 --> 01:09:22.527
Good.

1887
01:09:22.528 --> 01:09:23.905
If you don't sell it,

1888
01:09:23.906 --> 01:09:25.281
goodbye.

1889
01:09:27.075 --> 01:09:28.326
You have to have

1890
01:09:28.327 --> 01:09:29.576
a stern character

1891
01:09:29.577 --> 01:09:31.037
- to be able to
- even work with Manolo.


1892
01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.663
- An assistant would
- be impossible.


1893
01:09:33.707 --> 01:09:34.749
Goodbye to me?

1894
01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:35.791
No, goodbye to the shoe.

1895
01:09:35.792 --> 01:09:36.876
To the shoe.

1896
01:09:36.877 --> 01:09:39.254
Oh, one shoe, it's okay.

1897

McDOWELL:

1898
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:58.647
or his pump,

1899
01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.648
Manolo's décolleté,

1900
01:09:58.648 --> 01:10:00.108
is probably

1901
01:10:00.109 --> 01:10:01.567
his great signature.

You take in the whole

silhouette of the foot.

1904
01:10:10.451 --> 01:10:11.598
So the décolleté,

1905
01:10:11.599 --> 01:10:12.745
in the sense of a dress,

1906
01:10:12.746 --> 01:10:14.997
is the décolleté of a breast.

1907
01:10:14.998 --> 01:10:16.478
A décolleté in a shoe

1908
01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:17.958
is the toe cleavage.

[IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

1911
01:10:20.712 --> 01:10:22.819
The toe cleavage.

1912
01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:24.924
I find it so démodé.

1913
01:10:24.925 --> 01:10:26.634
- McDOWELL:
- A kitten heel is something that


1914
01:10:26.637 --> 01:10:28.261
- Manolo has done
- from the beginning.


1915
01:10:28.264 --> 01:10:29.720
It's about a 50-millimeter,

1916
01:10:29.721 --> 01:10:30.827
so it's slightly under

1917
01:10:30.828 --> 01:10:31.931
two and a half inches.

1918
01:10:31.932 --> 01:10:33.141
It often has

1919
01:10:33.142 --> 01:10:34.350
a sort of, like, curve to it.

1920
01:10:43.651 --> 01:10:44.820
And it's something

1921
01:10:44.821 --> 01:10:45.986
that sort of people

1922

- you know,
- "Think pink," kind of


1925
01:10:50.161 --> 01:10:51.827
That kind of era of shoes.

1926
01:10:53.578 --> 01:10:54.788
There's something

1927
01:10:54.789 --> 01:10:55.996
that's sort of kicky about it

1928
01:10:55.997 --> 01:10:57.665
and quite youngish about it.

1929
01:10:58.583 --> 01:11:00.500
Manolo is most famous,

1930
01:11:00.501 --> 01:11:02.670
of all designers, for the mule.

1931
01:11:13.598 --> 01:11:15.475
- He loves the sort of
- click-clack of a mule,


1932
01:11:15.478 --> 01:11:17.728
- So that basically when a woman
- walks down the street,


1933
01:11:17.731 --> 01:11:19.144
And you hear her coming,

1934
01:11:19.145 --> 01:11:21.064
- it's something
- that's very, very sexy.


1935
01:11:31.867 --> 01:11:33.222
How does he keep coming up

1936
01:11:33.223 --> 01:11:34.576
with things that are so right

1937
01:11:34.577 --> 01:11:36.496
- when I'm trying
- so hard and I can't?


1938
01:11:36.499 --> 01:11:37.977
And the fact is, you're trying

1939
01:11:37.978 --> 01:11:39.456
so hard and you can't

1940
01:11:39.457 --> 01:11:41.333
because you're six steps behind,

1941
01:11:41.334 --> 01:11:43.128
and he will always be,

1942
01:11:43.129 --> 01:11:44.920
like a little sprite, sort of,

1943
01:11:44.921 --> 01:11:46.630
you know, skipping ahead of you.

1944
01:11:46.631 --> 01:11:47.632
I love, I love the idea

1945
01:11:47.633 --> 01:11:48.633
of the combination

1946
01:11:48.634 --> 01:11:51.218
of Manolo and Rihanna.

1947
01:11:51.219 --> 01:11:52.762
I love the idea.

1948
01:11:52.763 --> 01:11:55.057
Yes, it's good,

1949
01:11:55.058 --> 01:11:57.349
it's going to be perfection.

1950
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:58.893
She have fun. She have fun.

1951
01:11:58.894 --> 01:12:01.104
- She have fun.
- This is what fashion should be.


1952
01:12:02.272 --> 01:12:03.981
I'm fascinated by the movement

1953
01:12:03.982 --> 01:12:06.233
of her, especially the neck.

1954
01:12:06.234 --> 01:12:07.736
She's beautiful.

1955
01:12:07.737 --> 01:12:09.237
She's like the new Grace Kelly.

1956
01:12:10.363 --> 01:12:12.322
Me, I love me

1957
01:12:12.323 --> 01:12:14.138
a stupid high shoe

1958
01:12:14.139 --> 01:12:15.952
that's out of control.

1959
01:12:17.287 --> 01:12:19.518
But I also don't like

1960
01:12:19.519 --> 01:12:21.749
to see a woman

1961
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:22.876
not be able to walk

1962
01:12:22.877 --> 01:12:24.001
in a shoe.

1963
01:12:24.002 --> 01:12:25.503
So I'm very considerate

1964
01:12:25.504 --> 01:12:27.004
of that,

1965
01:12:27.005 --> 01:12:28.945
you know, everybody can't wear

1966
01:12:28.946 --> 01:12:30.883
a super ridiculous heel.

1967
01:12:30.884 --> 01:12:33.677
Isn't that fabulous, that one?

1968
01:12:33.678 --> 01:12:34.679
This, I really love.

1969
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:35.680
It's called, like,

1970
01:12:35.681 --> 01:12:37.390
- I don't really know,
- like a pampas.


1971
01:12:37.393 --> 01:12:39.433
Your legs are that high?

1972
01:12:39.434 --> 01:12:40.435
Honey, yes.

1973
01:12:40.436 --> 01:12:41.436
She has long legs.

1974
01:12:41.437 --> 01:12:43.228
Baby, yes, she does.

1975
01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:44.961
I love them.

1976
01:12:44.962 --> 01:12:46.690
Like, I'm so excited about them.

1977
01:12:46.691 --> 01:12:48.443
Yes, I love a shoe that can

1978
01:12:48.444 --> 01:12:50.194
make another girl jealous.

1979
01:12:50.195 --> 01:12:51.488
And this is, like, one

1980
01:12:51.489 --> 01:12:52.780
of my favorite shoes.

1981
01:12:52.781 --> 01:12:53.907
So we're gonna do

1982
01:12:53.908 --> 01:12:55.032
a variation of that one,

1983
01:12:55.033 --> 01:12:56.055
but, like, we're

1984
01:12:56.056 --> 01:12:57.076
gonna do much more...

1985
01:12:57.077 --> 01:12:58.850
It should look like flesh.

1986
01:12:58.851 --> 01:13:00.620
Like a couture, fresher.

1987
01:13:00.621 --> 01:13:01.790
But then these embellishments

1988
01:13:01.791 --> 01:13:02.957
are, like, flesh tones.

1989
01:13:02.958 --> 01:13:04.667
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.


1990
01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:06.461
So it's just, like, naked

1991
01:13:06.462 --> 01:13:08.253
on your foot but sparkle.

1992
01:13:08.254 --> 01:13:09.547
Movement of the thing.

1993
01:13:09.548 --> 01:13:10.840
Yeah, just perfect.

1994
01:13:10.841 --> 01:13:13.384
- We're doing a couple of heights.
- This...


1995
01:13:13.387 --> 01:13:15.345
- Height heels. One of five.
- Compromise.


1996
01:13:15.348 --> 01:13:17.305
- Compromise? I compromise.
- Compromise.


1997
01:13:17.308 --> 01:13:18.431
Because Manolo knows

1998
01:13:18.432 --> 01:13:19.556
the comfortable heel.

1999
01:13:19.557 --> 01:13:21.101
- She knows what
- exactly going on.


2000
01:13:21.104 --> 01:13:22.811
- And she knows
- more than I do

2001
01:13:22.814 --> 01:13:24.166
Because I don't have

2002
01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:25.520
a clue what's going on.

2003
01:13:25.521 --> 01:13:26.898
I mean, I do what I do

2004
01:13:26.899 --> 01:13:28.273
and that's it. 
But she knows.

2005
01:13:28.274 --> 01:13:29.776
That is a great, great thing

2006
01:13:29.777 --> 01:13:31.276
that just push me to this.

2007
01:13:31.277 --> 01:13:32.527
It's a challenge.

2008
01:13:32.528 --> 01:13:33.968
He sort of sees it

2009
01:13:33.969 --> 01:13:35.405
almost as his duty

2010
01:13:35.406 --> 01:13:37.407
to make women look beautiful

2011
01:13:37.408 --> 01:13:39.244
- and feel great
- about their shoes.


2012
01:13:39.247 --> 01:13:42.789
It's... It's very touching.

2013
01:13:49.838 --> 01:13:51.631
- He always
- describes himself to me,


2014
01:13:51.634 --> 01:13:52.758
I'm sure to others,

2015
01:13:52.759 --> 01:13:53.883
as a cobbler.

2016
01:13:53.884 --> 01:13:54.968
Just sort of

2017
01:13:54.969 --> 01:13:56.051
the little cobbler living

2018
01:13:56.052 --> 01:13:57.512
above his shop

2019
01:13:57.513 --> 01:13:58.971
is his fantasy of himself

2020
01:13:58.972 --> 01:14:00.577
and I think it's where

2021
01:14:00.578 --> 01:14:02.183
he truly finds his happiness.

2022
01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:09.106
In Moscow, four years ago,

2023
01:14:09.107 --> 01:14:10.192
a woman said to me,

2024
01:14:10.193 --> 01:14:11.275
"Are you an artist?"

2025
01:14:11.276 --> 01:14:12.861
In French, in perfect French.

2026
01:14:23.204 --> 01:14:24.977
It's almost like a sort of

2027
01:14:24.978 --> 01:14:26.749
Dickensian shopkeeper,

2028
01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:28.272
you know,

2029
01:14:28.273 --> 01:14:29.794
and sort of a lot of bowing

2030
01:14:29.795 --> 01:14:31.879
and scraping and "Madam."

2031
01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.798
And, you know, it's just very...

2032
01:14:33.799 --> 01:14:35.633
- But it's very humble
- and very sweet.


2033
01:14:35.636 --> 01:14:38.468
And you sort of feel honored

2034
01:14:38.469 --> 01:14:39.721
to be so taken care of

2035
01:14:39.722 --> 01:14:40.971
and so treasured,

2036
01:14:40.972 --> 01:14:42.704
and so able

2037
01:14:42.705 --> 01:14:44.433
to make someone so happy.

2038
01:14:44.434 --> 01:14:45.728
There's two shoes for her.

2039
01:14:45.729 --> 01:14:47.019
They're great, I love them.

2040
01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.270
These are fabulous.

2041
01:14:48.271 --> 01:14:49.563
The coral one.

2042
01:14:49.564 --> 01:14:51.524
- Is this too small?
- No, it's perfect.


2043
01:14:51.527 --> 01:14:52.734
I...

2044
01:14:55.111 --> 01:14:56.445
You've got divine feet.

2045
01:14:56.446 --> 01:14:58.114
- Oh, well, ballerina,
- ballerina feet.


2046
01:14:58.117 --> 01:14:59.574
Ballerina. Is it tight?

2047
01:14:59.575 --> 01:15:01.033
No, they're perfect.

2048
01:15:01.034 --> 01:15:02.348
Long before I was a model,

2049
01:15:02.349 --> 01:15:03.660
I was a ballerina.

2050
01:15:03.661 --> 01:15:05.246
- This is first.
- First.


2051
01:15:05.249 --> 01:15:07.082
- This is second.
- Second.


2052
01:15:07.085 --> 01:15:08.791
This is third.

2053
01:15:08.792 --> 01:15:10.876
Fourth. And fifth.

2054
01:15:10.877 --> 01:15:12.628
God created women because

2055
01:15:12.629 --> 01:15:14.379
they should be like this.

2056
01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:15.841
- You'd be ideal
- for this sequence.


2057
01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:16.946
Yes. I...

2058
01:15:16.947 --> 01:15:18.051
You are Moira Shearer.

2059
01:15:25.308 --> 01:15:26.309
I do that...

2060
01:15:30.313 --> 01:15:31.606
I can, I can move,

2061
01:15:31.607 --> 01:15:32.898
I just can't talk.

2062
01:15:32.899 --> 01:15:34.691
Don't talk.

2063
01:15:34.692 --> 01:15:36.526
How lovely you look.

2064
01:15:36.527 --> 01:15:38.612
She is the modern woman.

2065
01:15:38.613 --> 01:15:39.989
Let's go.

2066
01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:41.783
- How are you?
- Hi. I'm ready.


2067
01:15:47.163 --> 01:15:48.706
Now that I'm getting older,

2068
01:15:48.707 --> 01:15:49.792
I'm back again

2069
01:15:49.793 --> 01:15:50.875
to the things that I used

2070
01:15:50.876 --> 01:15:52.209
to love when I was a child.

2071
01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:54.420
Sicily and The Leopard.

2072
01:15:57.173 --> 01:15:58.842
It is the most

2073
01:15:58.843 --> 01:16:00.509
extraordinary novel

2074
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:02.887
of the 20th century and now.

2075
01:16:02.888 --> 01:16:04.932
Each time that you read,

2076
01:16:04.933 --> 01:16:06.974
you find something new.

2077
01:16:06.975 --> 01:16:08.809
Another sentence and say,

2078
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:10.186
"Suddenly,

2079
01:16:10.187 --> 01:16:11.562
the sea had stopped."

2080
01:16:12.939 --> 01:16:14.775
- I don't want
- the page to finish.


2081
01:16:14.778 --> 01:16:17.027
- I don't think
- there's anything in the world


2082
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:19.445
As beautiful as Il Gattopardo.

2083
01:16:20.488 --> 01:16:21.989
I went to see the film.

2084
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:23.512
Since then,

2085
01:16:23.513 --> 01:16:25.034
I've been possessed by it.

2086
01:16:25.035 --> 01:16:26.828
- He's the only one
- who could capture


2087
01:16:26.831 --> 01:16:28.851
The essence of the dying

2088
01:16:28.852 --> 01:16:30.874
aristocracy in Sicily.

2089
01:16:31.833 --> 01:16:33.375
To me, it was incredible

2090
01:16:33.376 --> 01:16:34.690
and I still see it

2091
01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:36.004
every year, twice.

2092
01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:39.631
It's Italy through the eyes

2093
01:16:39.632 --> 01:16:41.051
of the genius.

2094
01:16:44.387 --> 01:16:45.888
I never knew Italy.

2095
01:16:45.889 --> 01:16:47.161
I never knew

2096
01:16:47.162 --> 01:16:48.432
the entire Sicilian culture.

2097
01:16:48.433 --> 01:16:52.061
The novel speaks about life

2098
01:16:52.062 --> 01:16:54.980
as a set number of years.

2099
01:16:54.981 --> 01:16:56.066
You have 60 years.

2100
01:16:56.067 --> 01:16:57.149
Centuries.

2101
01:16:57.150 --> 01:16:59.131
First, you are young, you go

2102
01:16:59.132 --> 01:17:01.111
around, you are in love,

2103
01:17:01.112 --> 01:17:02.384
then you mature,

2104
01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:03.655
you have children, some lovers,

2105
01:17:03.656 --> 01:17:05.554
then you retire,

2106
01:17:05.555 --> 01:17:07.451
and you are old,

2107
01:17:07.452 --> 01:17:09.244
and you must cope with death.

2108
01:17:09.245 --> 01:17:11.163
It's true about Lampedusa.

2109
01:17:11.164 --> 01:17:13.374
- There is no time, it's forever.
- Yes.


2110
01:17:13.374 --> 01:17:15.584
They come...

2111
01:17:13.377 --> 01:17:14.480
You understand?

2112
01:17:14.481 --> 01:17:15.585
It's forever.

2113
01:17:15.585 --> 01:17:17.628
They come again and again.

2114
01:17:22.300 --> 01:17:23.761
What I love about Sicily

2115
01:17:23.762 --> 01:17:25.220
is the divine light.

2116
01:17:26.512 --> 01:17:27.785
I have an incredible

2117
01:17:27.786 --> 01:17:29.056
sort of affection

2118
01:17:29.057 --> 01:17:30.976
for this Hellenistic culture.

2119
01:17:40.443 --> 01:17:42.988
The first thing I do

2120
01:17:42.989 --> 01:17:45.531
is look at the feet of statues.

2121
01:17:46.908 --> 01:17:48.368
I'm not a fetishist,

2122
01:17:48.369 --> 01:17:49.827
but I love feet.

2123
01:17:49.828 --> 01:17:51.579
I cannot even have any reaction,

2124
01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:53.330
sensuous or otherwise.

2125
01:17:53.331 --> 01:17:55.208
- When I see feet,
- it's simply beautiful.


2126
01:17:55.211 --> 01:17:57.168
I find it beautiful.

2127
01:17:59.295 --> 01:18:00.797
There are wonderful

2128
01:18:00.798 --> 01:18:02.297
erotic resonances

2129
01:18:02.298 --> 01:18:05.009
about shoes and sandals

2130
01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:06.427
in ancient Greece.

2131
01:18:07.678 --> 01:18:09.554
Did I have classical education?

2132
01:18:09.555 --> 01:18:10.849
I was born

2133
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:12.141
with a classical education.

2134
01:18:12.142 --> 01:18:13.748
We all know

2135
01:18:13.749 --> 01:18:15.352
that sucking people's toes

2136
01:18:15.353 --> 01:18:17.043
means something more

2137
01:18:17.044 --> 01:18:18.731
than just sucking their toes.

2138
01:18:18.732 --> 01:18:21.005
So in a way,

2139
01:18:21.006 --> 01:18:23.277
how you dress the foot

2140
01:18:23.278 --> 01:18:27.114
was as kind of edgy, I think,

2141
01:18:27.115 --> 01:18:28.846
in ancient Greece

2142
01:18:28.847 --> 01:18:30.575
and Rome as it is now.

2143
01:18:30.576 --> 01:18:32.412
- When you go
- and see Paolina Borghese


2144
01:18:32.415 --> 01:18:34.204
At the Borghese Museum,

2145
01:18:34.205 --> 01:18:36.166
- which is one of my favorite feet
- in the world,


2146
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:37.834
- I could kiss that feet
- for days.


2147
01:18:42.005 --> 01:18:45.090
He's not on his own in thinking

2148
01:18:45.091 --> 01:18:46.885
- that feet
- are really interesting.


2149
01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:48.240
And one of the things

2150
01:18:48.241 --> 01:18:49.594
you can't help but notice

2151
01:18:49.595 --> 01:18:51.035
when you look

2152
01:18:51.036 --> 01:18:52.472
at ancient sculpture

2153
01:18:52.473 --> 01:18:55.143
is quite how much attention

2154
01:18:55.144 --> 01:18:57.812
has gone into the foot.

2155
01:18:57.813 --> 01:18:59.002
But I never thought

2156
01:18:59.003 --> 01:19:00.189
about doing shoes ever.

2157
01:19:00.190 --> 01:19:01.900
Because, I mean, the shoes

2158
01:19:01.901 --> 01:19:03.608
destroy the beauty of the feet.

2159
01:19:03.609 --> 01:19:05.466
But I was very in love with

2160
01:19:05.467 --> 01:19:07.322
feet, yes. I still love feet.

2161
01:19:09.532 --> 01:19:11.723
So shoes and the classics are

2162
01:19:11.724 --> 01:19:13.911
all part of the same project.

2163
01:19:13.912 --> 01:19:15.622
And the shoes,

2164
01:19:15.623 --> 01:19:17.331
the product of him thinking,

2165
01:19:17.332 --> 01:19:18.541
of him talking,

2166
01:19:18.542 --> 01:19:19.750
of him working,

2167
01:19:19.751 --> 01:19:21.002
of him putting together

2168
01:19:21.003 --> 01:19:22.252
different bits

2169
01:19:22.253 --> 01:19:23.880
of world culture

2170
01:19:23.881 --> 01:19:25.505
into this new shape,

2171
01:19:25.506 --> 01:19:27.029
which turns out,

2172
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:28.551
amazingly, to be a shoe.

2173
01:19:36.017 --> 01:19:37.018
Manolo Blahnik.

2174
01:19:37.019 --> 01:19:38.020
Oh, again.

2175
01:19:40.021 --> 01:19:41.480
Yes?

2176
01:19:41.481 --> 01:19:42.670
Do you still celebrate

2177
01:19:42.671 --> 01:19:43.858
your birthday?

2178
01:19:43.859 --> 01:19:46.318
Oh, I try to forget.

2179
01:19:46.319 --> 01:19:48.029
- But...
- In fact, I don't do it.


2180
01:19:48.032 --> 01:19:49.072
I don't tell anybody.

2181
01:19:52.617 --> 01:19:54.326
Do you consider yourself old?

2182
01:19:54.327 --> 01:19:55.660
No.

2183
01:19:55.661 --> 01:19:56.872
No, I don't

2184
01:19:56.873 --> 01:19:58.080
ever think about that.

2185
01:19:58.081 --> 01:20:00.249
You are young at heart?

2186
01:20:00.250 --> 01:20:02.315
Well, yes, at heart,

2187
01:20:02.316 --> 01:20:04.379
yes, but not, not...

2188
01:20:07.173 --> 01:20:09.967
I rarely think about being...

2189
01:20:09.968 --> 01:20:11.698
Remembered.

2190
01:20:09.968 --> 01:20:13.428
whatever.

2191
01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:13.429
No, remember,

2192
01:20:13.429 --> 01:20:15.305
I enjoy every day.

2193
01:20:15.306 --> 01:20:17.142
- I mean, I enjoy
- every second or whatever.


2194
01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:18.226
But the legacy...

2195
01:20:18.227 --> 01:20:19.309
I don't want legacies.

2196
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:20.854
- No legacy?
- Legacies are nonsense.


2197
01:20:20.857 --> 01:20:22.312
I don't care less.

2198
01:20:22.313 --> 01:20:23.585
No, I don't.

2199
01:20:23.586 --> 01:20:24.857
I have no perception of this.

2200
01:20:24.858 --> 01:20:26.714
Never did, like fame

2201
01:20:26.715 --> 01:20:28.568
and things and this.

2202
01:20:28.569 --> 01:20:30.071
I don't give a damn.

2203
01:20:32.991 --> 01:20:34.575
What I do is very sort of...

2204
01:20:35.911 --> 01:20:37.120
passagé.

2205
01:20:43.919 --> 01:20:46.004
But the one I really like

2206
01:20:46.005 --> 01:20:48.088
the best is, like, I help to...

2207
01:20:48.089 --> 01:20:49.299
I help this profession

2208
01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.507
in a sense of,

2209
01:20:50.508 --> 01:20:52.448
like, more people doing it.

2210
01:20:52.449 --> 01:20:54.386
I like that.

2211
01:20:54.387 --> 01:20:55.723
Very, very exciting

2212
01:20:55.724 --> 01:20:57.056
to have created

2213
01:20:57.057 --> 01:20:59.309
- this kind of interest in shoes.
- This is the only thing


2214
01:20:59.312 --> 01:21:00.957
If I want

2215
01:21:00.958 --> 01:21:02.602
to remembered is, like,

2216
01:21:02.603 --> 01:21:04.501
possibly,

2217
01:21:04.502 --> 01:21:06.398
he make women lovely,

2218
01:21:06.399 --> 01:21:08.172
and men desire the women,

2219
01:21:08.173 --> 01:21:09.944
and blah, blah, blah.

2220
01:21:09.945 --> 01:21:10.946
To be a great designer,

2221
01:21:10.947 --> 01:21:11.947
great creator,

2222
01:21:11.948 --> 01:21:13.949
- you have to be interested
- in the world,


2223
01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:15.242
And in the history,

2224
01:21:15.243 --> 01:21:16.533
and in people.

2225
01:21:16.534 --> 01:21:17.598
And you just think

2226
01:21:17.599 --> 01:21:18.660
of the beautiful

2227
01:21:18.661 --> 01:21:20.120
and extraordinary women

2228
01:21:20.121 --> 01:21:22.123
that Manolo has made shoes

2229
01:21:22.124 --> 01:21:24.124
for over the years.

2230
01:21:24.125 --> 01:21:25.626
And who wears or has

2231
01:21:25.627 --> 01:21:27.127
worn your shoes best?

2232
01:21:27.128 --> 01:21:29.089
- There's - a good question.

2233
01:21:29.092 --> 01:21:31.465
You better. Um...

2234
01:21:31.466 --> 01:21:33.051
I don't know, but I have...

2235
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:36.846
Years ago, not now,

2236
01:21:36.847 --> 01:21:38.766
I saw somebody

2237
01:21:38.767 --> 01:21:40.682
in the station here,

2238
01:21:40.683 --> 01:21:42.123
and she was

2239
01:21:42.124 --> 01:21:43.560
a woman of certain age,

2240
01:21:43.561 --> 01:21:44.938
but she was, like, kind of...

2241
01:21:46.982 --> 01:21:48.483
She had this incredible

2242
01:21:48.484 --> 01:21:49.984
sort of presence,

2243
01:21:49.985 --> 01:21:53.112
a little bun, blond hair,

2244
01:21:53.113 --> 01:21:54.906
- glasses that
- looked like almost like


2245
01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:56.199
In the old-fashioned things

2246
01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.492
like a secretary.

2247
01:21:58.910 --> 01:22:00.120
But she was wearing

2248
01:22:00.121 --> 01:22:01.328
one of my pumps,

2249
01:22:01.329 --> 01:22:03.352
and it was like a little bit

2250
01:22:03.353 --> 01:22:05.374
tiny heel and she was so divine.

2251
01:22:05.375 --> 01:22:07.169
I never knew the woman, but

2252
01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:08.961
that is the woman I remember.

2253
01:22:08.962 --> 01:22:10.546
- This is the people
- I like to see,


2254
01:22:10.549 --> 01:22:12.069
Ordinary people wearing

2255
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:13.590
things so beautiful.

2256
01:22:13.591 --> 01:22:15.614
You can't create another

2257
01:22:15.615 --> 01:22:17.637
original like that.

2258
01:22:18.889 --> 01:22:21.515
I mean, he is exceptional,

2259
01:22:21.516 --> 01:22:23.684
I think, exceptional.

2260
01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.772
And long may he reign

2261
01:22:26.773 --> 01:22:28.523
being exceptional.

2262
01:22:31.109 --> 01:22:32.548
I wanted to do a shoe

2263
01:22:32.549 --> 01:22:33.986
for Mary Beard, Greek.

2264
01:22:33.987 --> 01:22:35.885
I think Manolo

2265
01:22:35.886 --> 01:22:37.782
is still full of surprises.

2266
01:22:37.783 --> 01:22:39.408
Sometimes he does collections,

2267
01:22:39.409 --> 01:22:40.994
like the one

2268
01:22:40.995 --> 01:22:42.577
with all the balls on the heel.

2269
01:22:42.578 --> 01:22:43.872
I mean, I was

2270
01:22:43.873 --> 01:22:45.164
completely overwhelmed by that.

2271
01:22:45.165 --> 01:22:46.749
There you go.

2272
01:22:46.750 --> 01:22:49.127
- This is like a...
- I feel like a monkey performing.


2273
01:22:50.295 --> 01:22:52.587
It is what I'm doing.

2274
01:22:52.588 --> 01:22:53.840
His breadth of imagination,

2275
01:22:53.841 --> 01:22:55.090
he is unique.

2276
01:22:55.091 --> 01:22:56.760
And when he's gone, sadly,

2277
01:22:56.761 --> 01:22:58.427
there will be none other.

2278
01:22:58.428 --> 01:22:59.596
There will never,

2279
01:22:59.597 --> 01:23:00.763
ever be another Manolo.

2280
01:23:00.764 --> 01:23:03.183
Heh. God.

2281
01:23:05.601 --> 01:23:06.728
The thing to do is not

2282
01:23:06.729 --> 01:23:07.853
to take yourself serious,

2283
01:23:07.854 --> 01:23:09.521
otherwise, you're finished.

2284
01:23:09.522 --> 01:23:11.358
So many of the people actually

2285
01:23:11.359 --> 01:23:13.192
don't create that much.

2286
01:23:13.193 --> 01:23:15.320
- I mean, they do,
- they go back to the flea market,


2287
01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:17.197
- And then they take something
- and they say,


2288
01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:19.239
"Okay, let's do it again."

2289
01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:21.492
Whereas with Manolo, it's

2290
01:23:21.493 --> 01:23:23.744
a completely different process.

2291
01:23:23.745 --> 01:23:26.206
Very deep and sensual process,

2292
01:23:26.207 --> 01:23:28.666
actually too.

2293
01:23:30.168 --> 01:23:31.711
I love decorating.

2294
01:23:31.712 --> 01:23:32.796
I mean, I love

2295
01:23:32.797 --> 01:23:33.879
the lines of the shoe,

2296
01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:35.464
but my favorite thing is, like,

2297
01:23:35.465 --> 01:23:36.487
thinking about

2298
01:23:36.488 --> 01:23:37.507
color and decoration.

2299
01:23:37.508 --> 01:23:38.550
I love that.

2300
01:23:38.551 --> 01:23:40.177
I would trust him to sort of,

2301
01:23:40.178 --> 01:23:42.014
like, you know,

2302
01:23:42.015 --> 01:23:43.848
remake my entire world

2303
01:23:43.849 --> 01:23:45.058
because of

2304
01:23:45.059 --> 01:23:46.266
just the sense of color.

2305
01:23:46.267 --> 01:23:48.603
The old techniques

2306
01:23:48.604 --> 01:23:50.938
of working are disappearing.

2307
01:23:50.939 --> 01:23:52.565
And the new people don't want

2308
01:23:52.566 --> 01:23:54.191
to learn new things.

2309
01:23:54.192 --> 01:23:56.401
He's original. 
He's a one-off.

2310
01:23:56.402 --> 01:23:57.508
I love the way he likes

2311
01:23:57.509 --> 01:23:58.612
to put on his white jacket

2312
01:23:58.613 --> 01:24:00.072
or his workman's jacket

2313
01:24:00.073 --> 01:24:02.532
and start carving shoes.

2314
01:24:02.533 --> 01:24:04.034
There's... I bet there's

2315
01:24:04.035 --> 01:24:05.871
not many designers

2316
01:24:05.872 --> 01:24:07.705
that do that themselves.

2317
01:24:07.706 --> 01:24:08.914
No, he's great.

2318
01:24:08.915 --> 01:24:10.708
I used to do everything myself,

2319
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:12.334
the heel, the last, everything,

2320
01:24:12.335 --> 01:24:14.461
but now it's like, you know,

2321
01:24:14.462 --> 01:24:16.423
I do the last,

2322
01:24:16.424 --> 01:24:18.382
I do the shape, and goodbye.

2323
01:24:18.383 --> 01:24:20.343
All Manolo shoes can fit,

2324
01:24:20.344 --> 01:24:22.302
not just fit on the foot,

2325
01:24:22.303 --> 01:24:23.805
but they fit into

2326
01:24:23.806 --> 01:24:25.305
world culture,

2327
01:24:25.306 --> 01:24:26.557
and he makes them

2328
01:24:26.558 --> 01:24:27.808
with that in mind.

2329
01:24:27.809 --> 01:24:30.020
I rather look beautifully made,

2330
01:24:30.021 --> 01:24:32.229
not expensive.

2331
01:24:32.230 --> 01:24:34.064
I don't like expensive things.

2332
01:24:34.065 --> 01:24:35.233
He is the king of shoes,

2333
01:24:35.234 --> 01:24:36.400
he really is.

2334
01:24:36.401 --> 01:24:38.443
And he is an artist.

2335
01:24:38.444 --> 01:24:40.279
And he's not about trend.

2336
01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.677
But, also, the most important

2337
01:24:41.678 --> 01:24:43.074
thing is the comfort factor.

2338
01:24:44.159 --> 01:24:46.077
- I love the way
- he calls his shoes


2339
01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.412
His creatures, you know,

2340
01:24:48.413 --> 01:24:50.895
because they're not like animals

2341
01:24:50.896 --> 01:24:53.375
and they're not like people,

2342
01:24:53.376 --> 01:24:54.899
but they are like creatures

2343
01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:56.421
of his imagination.

2344
01:24:57.964 --> 01:25:00.340
Oh, I'm sorry, don't you see it?

2345
01:25:00.341 --> 01:25:01.927
I think you see this nonsense.

2346
01:25:01.928 --> 01:25:03.511
This is really embarrassing.

2347
01:25:05.555 --> 01:25:06.723
Please.
