1
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:20.251
I keep nothing but a few
photographs in the bathroom


2
00:01:20.878 --> 00:01:23.004
of myself at an earlier time.

3
00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:30.344
The first shows me at the age of 25,
looking rather anxious.


4
00:01:30.554 --> 00:01:33.222
I've just bought a large house
in the country


5
00:01:33.724 --> 00:01:35.266
and cannot afford it.

6
00:01:36.226 --> 00:01:40.897
Here you see the young author
of Williwaw at the age of 19,


7
00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:43.190
still in uniform.

8
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.069
Here, above the bathtub,
in the place of honor,


9
00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:50.573
are the debates
with William Buckley in 1968.


10
00:01:50.782 --> 00:01:53.534
He was a well known
right-wing commentator


11
00:01:53.827 --> 00:01:56.329
whose name seldom passes my lips.

12
00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:24.649
Cameras, please. Cameras.

13
00:02:25.442 --> 00:02:26.859
William F. Buckley.

14
00:02:31.114 --> 00:02:32.990
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.


15
00:02:34.618 --> 00:02:36.285
That was a very nice introduction.

16
00:02:38.246 --> 00:02:39.497
On the other hand,
if it hadn't been,


17
00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:41.332
I would've smashed you
in the goddamn face.


18
00:02:50.926 --> 00:02:52.593
I do this so well...

19
00:02:53.428 --> 00:02:54.845
and so terminally,

20
00:02:55.138 --> 00:02:59.725
I have left the bleeding corpse
of William F. Buckley, Jr.


21
00:03:00.268 --> 00:03:03.229
on the floor of
the convention hall in Chicago.


22
00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:06.649
I would definitely have
Gore Vidal and Bill Buckley


23
00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:08.109
on my television show.

24
00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:11.445
I would guess that the rematch
of the great conflict


25
00:03:11.613 --> 00:03:14.323
would attract people precisely
because it held out


26
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.993
- the possibility of something--
- Violence.


27
00:03:18.537 --> 00:03:20.496
- Camera speeding.
- Action.


28
00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.178
In the 60's

29
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.641
the institution in which
Americans had the greatest confidence


30
00:03:40.934 --> 00:03:42.476
was television news.

31
00:03:49.234 --> 00:03:51.902
Split-second organization
on a worldwide scale,


32
00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.531
speed and efficiency in
the nerve centers of NBC News.


33
00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:59.493
News was this big, bland center

34
00:03:59.661 --> 00:04:02.955
that determined for us
what America was.


35
00:04:03.123 --> 00:04:06.167
Which was white, Anglo
-Saxon,

36
00:04:06.334 --> 00:04:08.586
there were never any vowels
at the end of the names.


37
00:04:08.837 --> 00:04:10.296
Chet Huntley and
David Brinkley


38
00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:12.006
still are the team supreme

39
00:04:12.174 --> 00:04:13.924
in the art of easygoing commentary.

40
00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:19.013
Networks, did they deal
in controversy? No!


41
00:04:19.473 --> 00:04:21.891
Did they invite controversy? No!

42
00:04:22.976 --> 00:04:25.269
They were in the center.

43
00:04:25.645 --> 00:04:28.397
They were cementers of idea,

44
00:04:28.565 --> 00:04:31.650
not disrupters of idea.

45
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.820
This is the CBS Evening
News with Walter Cronkite.


46
00:04:34.988 --> 00:04:37.323
Good evening from our CBS newsroom
in New York.


47
00:04:37.491 --> 00:04:39.366
NBC and CBS
were fighting for the lead


48
00:04:39.534 --> 00:04:41.786
and ABC was clearly number three.

49
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.750
The other two networks were doing
full coverage at the conventions,


50
00:04:48.585 --> 00:04:49.960
gavel-to-gavel.

51
00:04:52.964 --> 00:04:56.050
Turn the cameras and microphones on
and let them roll.


52
00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:02.556
And ABC had less money to spend
on these things.


53
00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:08.896
So, in 1968 ABC went to the truncated
version of convention coverage


54
00:05:09.064 --> 00:05:11.941
to do an hour and a half
from 9:30 to 11:00 at night.


55
00:05:12.734 --> 00:05:16.570
They didn't have Cronkite,
didn't have Huntley and Brinkley.


56
00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:19.698
They didn't have the standards.

57
00:05:20.033 --> 00:05:21.826
Cameras, please. Cameras.

58
00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:32.586
ABC was the third
of the three networks.


59
00:05:36.424 --> 00:05:38.551
Would've been fourth,
but there were only three.


60
00:05:39.302 --> 00:05:41.345
They had the weaker programming.

61
00:05:42.931 --> 00:05:45.599
Somebody famously said
that the way to end the Vietnam war


62
00:05:45.767 --> 00:05:48.978
was to put it on ABC and
it'd be canceled in 13 weeks.


63
00:05:52.566 --> 00:05:56.527
In order to be competitive,
with the 1968 convention,


64
00:05:56.987 --> 00:06:00.906
ABC needed something.
Provocative.


65
00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:02.741
A media event.

66
00:06:02.951 --> 00:06:05.786
And they settled on
Buckley and Vidal.


67
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.713
It wasn't necessarily sensible.

68
00:06:16.798 --> 00:06:18.382
It was a shot in the dark.

69
00:06:19.176 --> 00:06:23.387
And it changed television... forever.

70
00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:29.602
Why are the races unreconciled?

71
00:06:29.769 --> 00:06:31.687
Why does poverty persevere?

72
00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:33.189
Why are the young disenchanted?

73
00:06:33.356 --> 00:06:35.649
Why do the birds sing so unhappily?

74
00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:37.735
It is easy to be carried away.

75
00:06:37.903 --> 00:06:40.946
And yet always there is
a strain of seriousness,


76
00:06:41.114 --> 00:06:42.698
something in the system
that warns us.


77
00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:46.035
Warns us that America had better
strike out on a different course,


78
00:06:46.203 --> 00:06:48.704
rather than face another
four years of asphyxiation


79
00:06:48.872 --> 00:06:49.955
by liberal premises.

80
00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:53.709
This is William F. Buckley, Jr.
in New York.


81
00:06:54.753 --> 00:06:57.171
Perfect.

82
00:06:58.215 --> 00:07:00.799
This is the William
F. Buckley America knows best.


83
00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:03.802
Grimacing or incredulous
or disdainful.


84
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:06.680
Readying himself
for a deceptively quiet attack


85
00:07:06.848 --> 00:07:08.933
on his intellectual prey
of the moment.


86
00:07:09.851 --> 00:07:12.478
This is the William F. Buckley
Barry Goldwater insists


87
00:07:12.646 --> 00:07:14.438
fills a crying national need.

88
00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:17.650
We want Buckley!
We want Buckley!


89
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.279
William F. Buckley, Jr.

90
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.532
has a strong
definite opinion on every subject.


91
00:07:26.034 --> 00:07:28.369
So, wherever he goes,
he has to have an answer


92
00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:30.037
about every question.

93
00:07:30.664 --> 00:07:31.914
Do you think
America doesn't


94
00:07:32.082 --> 00:07:33.499
believe in itself
as much as it used to?


95
00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:35.125
Yes, I think that's true.

96
00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:39.964
I think it's happening
because of a restlessness


97
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:42.925
for so long,
as liberalism suggested,


98
00:07:43.093 --> 00:07:45.511
that it could bring
happiness to the individual.


99
00:07:45.971 --> 00:07:48.180
Then people tended to look
to government agencies


100
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.893
for those narcotic substitutes
for a search for happiness


101
00:07:53.228 --> 00:07:56.188
and contentment, which they ought
to have found in their religion,


102
00:07:56.356 --> 00:07:58.148
in their institutions
and their culture themselves.


103
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:06.532
Buckley was the first
modern conservative intellectual


104
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.786
to see that ideological debates
were cultural debates.


105
00:08:10.954 --> 00:08:15.666
And what he did was to put
conservatism on the march.


106
00:08:15.917 --> 00:08:18.794
And that's the creation of
the movement that we have today.


107
00:08:20.046 --> 00:08:23.382
He's stimulating.
He's exhausting. He's fun.


108
00:08:24.259 --> 00:08:28.554
Sometimes I could kill him...
but not too often.


109
00:08:29.222 --> 00:08:31.932
He could've been
the playboy of the Western world


110
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.937
but he chose to be the St. Paul
of the conservative movement.


111
00:08:38.356 --> 00:08:39.606
Most work days,
he winds up


112
00:08:39.774 --> 00:08:41.734
in the offices of
the National Review,


113
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:43.485
his journal
of conservative opinion


114
00:08:43.653 --> 00:08:48.240
which reaches 110,000 subscribers
and is read by many more.


115
00:08:51.244 --> 00:08:54.079
National Review
is the most influential


116
00:08:54.247 --> 00:08:55.873
magazine of our time.

117
00:08:56.624 --> 00:09:00.002
Why?
The magazine attached to a movement.


118
00:09:01.838 --> 00:09:04.548
My brother, Bill,
he was a conservative,


119
00:09:04.716 --> 00:09:06.842
right-wing libertarian Christian.

120
00:09:07.135 --> 00:09:08.510
That's what he was.

121
00:09:10.138 --> 00:09:13.182
But most of all,
Bill was a revolutionary.


122
00:09:14.726 --> 00:09:17.519
When the people at ABC
had first approached Bill,


123
00:09:17.771 --> 00:09:19.605
they had asked him would he
be willing to be


124
00:09:19.773 --> 00:09:23.609
the conservative debater commentator
with the national conventions.


125
00:09:23.777 --> 00:09:25.277
And he said, yes, he would.

126
00:09:25.445 --> 00:09:27.529
And they asked him, "Well, is there
anybody you wouldn't go on with?"


127
00:09:27.697 --> 00:09:30.949
And he said, "Well, I would
refuse to go on with a Communist."


128
00:09:31.326 --> 00:09:35.037
"And, apart from that, the only one
I can think of is Gore Vidal."


129
00:09:36.748 --> 00:09:38.248
Camera's rolling.

130
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:41.502
Men and women
who are sexually repressed


131
00:09:41.669 --> 00:09:47.007
regard all sexual pleasure as
"dirty," "evil," "the devil's work."


132
00:09:47.384 --> 00:09:50.177
Yet we are all prostitutes
in one sense or another,


133
00:09:50.345 --> 00:09:51.804
ethically, if not sexually.

134
00:09:52.764 --> 00:09:55.391
For Buckley, Vidal was the devil.

135
00:09:55.558 --> 00:10:01.939
He represented everything
that was going to moral hell...


136
00:10:03.942 --> 00:10:06.652
that was degenerative
about the country.


137
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.074
A cultural war has now joined
the race war in the United States.


138
00:10:13.034 --> 00:10:16.161
And the change
is going to be very difficult.


139
00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:19.206
And as our own
Thomas Jefferson once said,


140
00:10:19.374 --> 00:10:22.376
"The tree of liberty must
occasionally be watered with blood."


141
00:10:24.754 --> 00:10:28.257
In a sense, this was the beginning
of a war between an old order


142
00:10:28.425 --> 00:10:30.717
and what I hoped
would be a new order.


143
00:10:35.098 --> 00:10:37.307
Gore didn't just see
rioting in the streets,


144
00:10:37.517 --> 00:10:39.518
he saw revolution breaking out.

145
00:10:41.813 --> 00:10:44.314
Remember, Gore Vidal
was always an iconoclast.


146
00:10:45.191 --> 00:10:48.360
An apostate.
A writer against the grain.


147
00:10:49.988 --> 00:10:53.407
And he saw Buckley and his ideas
as anti-Democratic.


148
00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:58.203
If Buckley were not taken out,
his ideas would take down the nation.


149
00:10:59.497 --> 00:11:04.209
It occurred to me that the central
drive in human beings is power.


150
00:11:05.503 --> 00:11:08.297
And that has always been my theme,
that ideal in politics,


151
00:11:08.465 --> 00:11:10.549
which is an obvious
manifestation of power.


152
00:11:12.343 --> 00:11:14.303
Gore Vidal is one of
America's most successful


153
00:11:14.471 --> 00:11:15.804
and distinguished writers.

154
00:11:16.431 --> 00:11:19.433
He also lives in a personal cloud
of outrageous legends.


155
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:22.686
After the early books, which first
brought him to the public eye,


156
00:11:23.104 --> 00:11:25.898
came a group of highly praised
historical novels


157
00:11:26.065 --> 00:11:27.441
which sold in the millions.

158
00:11:27.817 --> 00:11:30.819
But it was Myra Breckinridge
that confirmed Vidal's place


159
00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:34.531
as the enfant terrible of the
respectable American literary scene.


160
00:11:34.908 --> 00:11:38.243
By 1968, he had just
published a bombshell of a book,


161
00:11:38.411 --> 00:11:41.580
his greatest satire, and, I think,
one of the greatest satires written


162
00:11:41.748 --> 00:11:43.415
in English, Myra Breckinridge.

163
00:11:44.876 --> 00:11:46.793
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

164
00:11:46.961 --> 00:11:49.463
what you've all been waiting for...

165
00:11:49.672 --> 00:11:51.131
The book that couldn't be written

166
00:11:51.299 --> 00:11:54.593
is now the motion picture
that couldn't be made:


167
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:56.803
Myra Breckinridge.

168
00:11:58.473 --> 00:12:01.391
He'd gotten, you know,
the cover of TIME magazine for it.


169
00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:03.435
And his career
was soaring at the time.


170
00:12:03.603 --> 00:12:06.396
But, it was edgy material.

171
00:12:06.981 --> 00:12:08.941
I don't know where Myra came from.

172
00:12:09.108 --> 00:12:12.152
I really was like the character,
each day wondering what Myra would do


173
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.531
and roaring with laughter as this
thing presented herself to me.


174
00:12:17.283 --> 00:12:18.534
Gentlemen...

175
00:12:20.161 --> 00:12:22.246
I am Myron Breckinridge.

176
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.207
Uncle Buck, your fag nephew
became your niece


177
00:12:25.375 --> 00:12:28.710
two years ago in Copenhagen,
and is now free as a bird


178
00:12:28.878 --> 00:12:32.756
and happy in being the most
extraordinary woman in the world!


179
00:12:33.675 --> 00:12:36.843
And suddenly, it occurred to me,
about sexual relations.


180
00:12:37.011 --> 00:12:40.722
How indeed much of it is based
not upon any pleasure principle,


181
00:12:40.890 --> 00:12:42.099
or even a procreative one,

182
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.018
but of people
gaining power over others.


183
00:12:45.186 --> 00:12:46.687
Ah-ha! Gotcha!

184
00:12:47.188 --> 00:12:51.400
And so I conceived
of my androgynous protagonist


185
00:12:52.777 --> 00:12:55.320
who is a man who becomes a woman
who becomes a man.


186
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:58.156
A transsexual seducing men,

187
00:12:58.324 --> 00:13:00.409
or in one case,
I believe, raping a man...


188
00:13:00.577 --> 00:13:02.995
Yay-haa!

189
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:04.705
Uh...

190
00:13:06.416 --> 00:13:08.125
The themes of Myra Breckinridge,

191
00:13:08.293 --> 00:13:10.419
and also sexuality
and transsexuality,


192
00:13:10.587 --> 00:13:12.129
was way ahead of its time

193
00:13:12.297 --> 00:13:13.880
and got under Bill Buckley's skin.

194
00:13:16.467 --> 00:13:21.388
Mr. Buckley, did you see the film
Myra Breckinridge, and why not?


195
00:13:23.725 --> 00:13:25.851
That told the people at ABC:

196
00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:28.562
"Wow, we have a chance
for some great theater here!


197
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.022
Let's get Gore Vidal."

198
00:13:35.445 --> 00:13:39.615
Gore Vidal is a whore of debate.

199
00:13:40.033 --> 00:13:43.327
And when it comes to values
of our country,


200
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.370
and of historical forces,

201
00:13:45.538 --> 00:13:47.497
the man is brilliant.

202
00:13:48.249 --> 00:13:51.126
And the man is fun to watch.

203
00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:55.589
But there is always a residue,
in my opinion,


204
00:13:55.965 --> 00:13:58.508
when I watch him,
of nausea.


205
00:14:01.304 --> 00:14:03.430
I didn't say anything nasty
about him, did I?


206
00:14:06.434 --> 00:14:07.809
It is under... No.

207
00:14:07.977 --> 00:14:09.895
All right.

208
00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:18.862
It is understandable
that the Republicans decided


209
00:14:19.072 --> 00:14:21.823
to hold their convention
south of the Mason-Dixon line.


210
00:14:22.158 --> 00:14:24.951
They had not done so in 104 years.

211
00:14:25.244 --> 00:14:29.164
And it is obvious why anyone
might want to come to Miami Beach.


212
00:14:29.916 --> 00:14:32.501
But the real reasons for
the Republican presence here


213
00:14:32.669 --> 00:14:35.337
are less obvious.
And I blew that one. Let's--


214
00:14:45.598 --> 00:14:49.851
This nine-mile-long sandbar
has one advantage above all others,


215
00:14:50.019 --> 00:14:51.144
it is remote.

216
00:14:52.021 --> 00:14:53.939
It's therefore easy
for the Republicans


217
00:14:54.107 --> 00:14:56.983
to avoid the danger of large,
militant demonstrations.


218
00:15:03.991 --> 00:15:06.827
There's a huge, almost empty
convention hall down there


219
00:15:06.994 --> 00:15:09.913
waiting for
the 1968 Republican convention.


220
00:15:10.081 --> 00:15:13.625
There's very little work left to do
before the first gavel on Monday.


221
00:15:17.046 --> 00:15:21.174
Every political convention has
features no other before it has had.


222
00:15:21.342 --> 00:15:23.343
What's going to be distinctive
about this one?


223
00:15:23.511 --> 00:15:26.221
First of all, this is the first one
available to the public


224
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:28.181
completely in beautiful color,

225
00:15:28.349 --> 00:15:30.517
and lady delegates have received
careful instructions


226
00:15:30.727 --> 00:15:34.062
about how to dress so as
to appear vivid, but not garish.


227
00:15:40.236 --> 00:15:42.195
Bill Buckley took off
for a week sailing


228
00:15:42.363 --> 00:15:44.614
before the Republican
National Convention.


229
00:15:45.283 --> 00:15:47.617
They sailed down to Cozumel.

230
00:15:48.327 --> 00:15:51.496
I would be rather surprised
if he did any special preparation


231
00:15:51.706 --> 00:15:53.999
for this encounter with Gore Vidal.

232
00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:56.626
Buckley expected this to be

233
00:15:56.794 --> 00:16:01.923
an opportunity to debate the issues,
to have some fun.


234
00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:05.427
He was not prepared for Mr. Vidal.

235
00:16:06.471 --> 00:16:08.764
Gore told me he hired a researcher.

236
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:13.518
He wanted to paint National Review
as being racist,


237
00:16:13.686 --> 00:16:15.979
if he could, anti
-Semitic.

238
00:16:17.023 --> 00:16:21.526
I don't think he was really
interested in conducting a debate


239
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:25.155
about the issues
or about the parties


240
00:16:25.323 --> 00:16:28.909
or about the policies or about
the platforms of the two parties.


241
00:16:29.076 --> 00:16:32.579
What he wanted to do
was to expose Bill Buckley.


242
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.589
Their confrontation
is about lifestyle,


243
00:16:43.716 --> 00:16:46.510
what kind of people should we be.

244
00:16:47.512 --> 00:16:50.889
Their real argument,
in front of the public,


245
00:16:51.307 --> 00:16:53.433
is "who is the better person."

246
00:16:56.813 --> 00:17:01.274
In one minute, A Second Look
with William Buckley and Gore Vidal.


247
00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:07.614
Across from us
was Howard K. Smith.


248
00:17:08.157 --> 00:17:11.368
Suave, intelligent,
madly apprehensive.


249
00:17:11.536 --> 00:17:14.955
Rehearsing with his lips the lines
he would presently deliver.


250
00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:19.000
Thirty, 40, 50 technicians,
reporters, directors


251
00:17:19.377 --> 00:17:20.877
filled the enormous room,

252
00:17:21.546 --> 00:17:24.631
at one corner of which,
earphones attached,


253
00:17:24.966 --> 00:17:27.926
Vidal and I awaited
the sound of the bell.


254
00:17:29.846 --> 00:17:30.971
From past experience, I knew

255
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.849
that Buckley
would have done no research.


256
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.352
That what facts he had at his command
would be jumbled


257
00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.521
by the strangest syntax.

258
00:17:41.274 --> 00:17:43.066
We'd exchanged minimal amenities.

259
00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:47.529
And I scribbled on my clipboard to
avoid having to banter with him.


260
00:17:48.114 --> 00:17:49.948
And he did the same.

261
00:17:50.616 --> 00:17:52.450
For all their
ideological differences,


262
00:17:52.618 --> 00:17:54.202
they both see what the problem is.

263
00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.580
That America can't stay
on the course it's on.


264
00:17:56.747 --> 00:17:58.999
And that the country's
being split at the seams.


265
00:17:59.876 --> 00:18:02.002
And each has staked out his position

266
00:18:02.169 --> 00:18:08.258
in ways that portend where our
country is divided right now.


267
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:14.764
To help us extract meaning
from these conventions,


268
00:18:14.932 --> 00:18:18.101
two of America's most eloquent
and most decided commentators


269
00:18:18.269 --> 00:18:19.686
have joined us this year.

270
00:18:19.854 --> 00:18:23.899
They are Gore Vidal
and William F. Buckley, Jr.


271
00:18:24.066 --> 00:18:27.319
Can Mr. Vidal
assess the Republicans for us?


272
00:18:27.904 --> 00:18:32.532
Can a political party based almost
entirely upon human greed


273
00:18:33.284 --> 00:18:35.577
nominate anyone for President

274
00:18:35.745 --> 00:18:38.830
for whom a majority
of the American people would vote?


275
00:18:40.499 --> 00:18:42.709
May I comment, Mr. Smith?

276
00:18:42.877 --> 00:18:43.960
- Please do.
- Yeah.


277
00:18:44.128 --> 00:18:49.049
It seems to me that the author
of Myra Breckinridge


278
00:18:49.216 --> 00:18:51.718
is well acquainted with
the imperatives of human greed.


279
00:18:52.136 --> 00:18:54.137
Well, I would like to say,
Bill, if I may--


280
00:18:54.305 --> 00:18:57.307
If I may say, Bill,
before you go any further,


281
00:18:57.475 --> 00:19:01.645
I would like to say if there were a
contest for Mr. Myra Breckinridge


282
00:19:01.812 --> 00:19:03.355
you would unquestionably win it.

283
00:19:03.522 --> 00:19:06.066
I based her entire style
polemically upon you:


284
00:19:06.233 --> 00:19:07.609
passionate and irrelevant.

285
00:19:07.777 --> 00:19:14.491
Now, my point is that for Mr. Vidal
to contend a particular party


286
00:19:14.659 --> 00:19:16.743
as engaged in the pursuit
of human greed,


287
00:19:16.911 --> 00:19:19.788
requires us to understand
his rather eccentric definitions.


288
00:19:19.956 --> 00:19:21.748
Is it greedy really
for a people to suggest


289
00:19:21.916 --> 00:19:24.626
that what matters to poor people
is that they have houses?


290
00:19:24.794 --> 00:19:27.128
Is it really greedy to want to
preserve our freedom?


291
00:19:27.296 --> 00:19:32.384
We have the luxury of being able
to focus on those who are poor


292
00:19:32.551 --> 00:19:34.678
in our midst as though we can
do something about it.


293
00:19:34.845 --> 00:19:36.221
Which is something
that no other country


294
00:19:36.389 --> 00:19:39.015
less occupied with human greed has--

295
00:19:39.183 --> 00:19:42.310
The nice thing about the Republican
party is that every four years


296
00:19:42.478 --> 00:19:44.896
after denigrating the poor
amongst themselves,


297
00:19:45.064 --> 00:19:47.273
referring to them as "freeloaders,"
"they don't want to work,"


298
00:19:47.441 --> 00:19:49.401
and I have many quotes here
from Ronald Reagan.


299
00:19:49.568 --> 00:19:52.696
And then every four years you get
this sort of crocodile tears


300
00:19:52.863 --> 00:19:55.240
for the poor people
because they need their vote.


301
00:19:55.408 --> 00:19:59.077
It is quite true that Reagan is
capable of talking about freeloaders,


302
00:19:59.245 --> 00:20:02.497
so am I,
because there are freeloaders.


303
00:20:02.665 --> 00:20:07.293
It is one thing to say that
a society ought to concern itself


304
00:20:07.461 --> 00:20:09.087
with the plight of its poor.
I think the Republican party


305
00:20:09.255 --> 00:20:10.380
is saying that.

306
00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:11.881
Perhaps the Republican party
should have


307
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:15.051
a platform on how to deal with Vidal.

308
00:20:15.219 --> 00:20:17.887
If absolutely necessary, I will write
it for them, but meanwhile--


309
00:20:18.055 --> 00:20:20.890
Meanwhile, I'd be very, very nervous.
You have written lately of your


310
00:20:21.058 --> 00:20:23.518
intimacy with Reagan and with Nixon

311
00:20:23.686 --> 00:20:25.812
and that you've discussed
the Vietnam War with them


312
00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:27.939
and that you are satisfied
with their positions.


313
00:20:28.107 --> 00:20:31.985
Since you're in favor of the nuclear
bombing of North Vietnam,


314
00:20:32.153 --> 00:20:35.947
I'd be very worried about
your kind of odd neurosis--


315
00:20:36.115 --> 00:20:39.743
Or more like neurosis being a friend
of anybody who might be a president.


316
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.162
I've never advocated the nuclear
bombing of North Vietnam.


317
00:20:42.496 --> 00:20:45.749
You have, and I'll give you
time and place even.


318
00:20:46.083 --> 00:20:47.792
- Well, you won't, because I never--
- I will.


319
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.544
I will if we don't mind.
The record--


320
00:20:49.712 --> 00:20:51.755
No, now wait a minute,
don't duck away from the record.


321
00:20:51.922 --> 00:20:55.216
You suggested the atom bombing
of the north of Vietnam


322
00:20:55.384 --> 00:20:57.469
in your little magazine,
which I do not read,


323
00:20:57.636 --> 00:21:01.181
but I'm told about,
on February 23, 1968.


324
00:21:01.348 --> 00:21:02.849
So you're very hawkish.

325
00:21:03.017 --> 00:21:05.894
And now, if both Nixon and Reagan
are listening to you,


326
00:21:06.062 --> 00:21:07.687
I'm very worried for the country.

327
00:21:07.855 --> 00:21:10.648
Now, it seems to me that
the Republican party


328
00:21:10.816 --> 00:21:14.319
has shown a record of greater
sobriety than Mr. Vidal,


329
00:21:14.487 --> 00:21:17.197
who boasts of not reading something
which he has prepared to misquote


330
00:21:17.364 --> 00:21:19.032
in the presence of the person
who edits this.


331
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.702
Now, Bill Buckley,
if the quotation is exact...


332
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:26.956
Now don't be... We know your
tendency is to be feline, Mr. Vidal,


333
00:21:27.249 --> 00:21:30.919
but just relax for a moment
and think very simply on this.


334
00:21:31.087 --> 00:21:34.339
I have not advocated...
I'm not horrified at the prospect.


335
00:21:34.507 --> 00:21:36.800
Bill, I just quoted where you said
these things and where.


336
00:21:36.967 --> 00:21:39.636
- Are you saying you didn't say them?
- I'm saying that I didn't say them.


337
00:21:39.804 --> 00:21:42.013
- You're taking them back?
- That your misquotation--


338
00:21:42.181 --> 00:21:44.641
Tune in this time tomorrow night
and we will have further evidence


339
00:21:44.809 --> 00:21:47.393
of Bill Buckley,
cold warrior turned hot.


340
00:21:47.561 --> 00:21:49.312
Right, and about the human greed
of everybody in the world


341
00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.731
- except yourself.
- There are saints.


342
00:21:51.899 --> 00:21:54.109
Tomorrow, what Mr. Vidal
thinks about the Kennedys.


343
00:21:54.276 --> 00:21:56.236
Good night, and let me tell you.

344
00:21:57.404 --> 00:21:58.947
Excuse me, gentlemen.

345
00:21:59.156 --> 00:22:01.449
It's been very enjoyable
hearing you articulate


346
00:22:01.617 --> 00:22:03.701
two points of view.
Thank you very much indeed.


347
00:22:03.869 --> 00:22:06.162
I think I detected some
unfinished lines of thought.


348
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.623
We'll have time to follow them
through tomorrow.


349
00:22:08.791 --> 00:22:12.127
And tomorrow. And tomorrow.
Every night, we...


350
00:22:12.336 --> 00:22:14.504
There's nothing feigned
about the mutual antipathy.


351
00:22:15.506 --> 00:22:17.715
They really do despise one another.

352
00:22:18.843 --> 00:22:21.219
Each thought that the other
was quite dangerous.


353
00:22:21.637 --> 00:22:25.265
And it was drawn from quite a deep
well in both cases.


354
00:22:25.975 --> 00:22:28.768
Gore Vidal and William Buckley
first clashed,


355
00:22:28.936 --> 00:22:34.149
almost by proxy, in 1962
on The Jack Paar Program.


356
00:22:34.608 --> 00:22:36.192
Vidal had gone on Jack Paar's show

357
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.862
and they both started
mocking Buckley:


358
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:43.116
his eccentric mannerisms,
the voice,


359
00:22:43.284 --> 00:22:46.035
the facial tics, all the rest.

360
00:22:46.537 --> 00:22:48.454
So, in effect,
Buckley was given equal time.


361
00:22:48.622 --> 00:22:50.874
And he went on Jack Paar's show.

362
00:22:51.083 --> 00:22:56.880
And Paar expected that kind of
troglodyte Neanderthal


363
00:22:57.047 --> 00:23:02.010
man-of-the-right whom Vidal had
caricatured on the program.


364
00:23:02.178 --> 00:23:06.014
And instead,
you have this genius of debate.


365
00:23:06.807 --> 00:23:09.517
And Paar was stunned.

366
00:23:11.812 --> 00:23:14.814
We next met in San Francisco, 1964,

367
00:23:14.982 --> 00:23:17.358
during the Goldwater convention.

368
00:23:17.526 --> 00:23:20.653
I confessed to having prepared
a trap for Buckley.


369
00:23:20.821 --> 00:23:22.822
I egged him on.

370
00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:25.241
The next day, Buckley sent me
a letter to the effect


371
00:23:25.409 --> 00:23:27.493
that he never wanted to see me again.

372
00:23:28.204 --> 00:23:31.414
I found this sentiment agreeable.

373
00:23:33.459 --> 00:23:36.586
Buckley was eager
to be on television.


374
00:23:37.504 --> 00:23:41.799
The downside of it for Gore was that
he contributed to Buckley's...


375
00:23:42.593 --> 00:23:45.011
becoming an onscreen celebrity.

376
00:23:49.934 --> 00:23:52.852
Mr. Buckley,
read by many, but not that many,


377
00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:55.188
would be nothing if it wasn't for
his program Firing Line.


378
00:23:55.356 --> 00:23:57.941
Buckley sat in his chair
with a clipboard


379
00:23:58.108 --> 00:24:02.570
and would invite left-wingers
or liberals on his program,


380
00:24:02.738 --> 00:24:05.156
and they would go back and forth
for half an hour.


381
00:24:05.324 --> 00:24:08.368
People on the left are
more law-abiding than anybody else.


382
00:24:08.535 --> 00:24:10.453
That's why they're on the left.

383
00:24:10.746 --> 00:24:12.372
- Explain that, would you?
- I'd be happy to.


384
00:24:12.539 --> 00:24:14.332
You're marvelous. I adore you.

385
00:24:14.541 --> 00:24:15.917
You're the only man
who can ask your question,


386
00:24:16.085 --> 00:24:18.378
and convict the man
before he can answer the question.


387
00:24:19.046 --> 00:24:21.589
Television was happy to have Bill

388
00:24:21.757 --> 00:24:24.509
because everybody else
was saying the same thing.


389
00:24:24.677 --> 00:24:28.554
From my point of view,
what Elijah Muhammad is doing to you


390
00:24:28.722 --> 00:24:31.849
is diseasing your mind.

391
00:24:32.017 --> 00:24:37.897
You sit and tell me that we white
people like to divide and conquer.


392
00:24:38.065 --> 00:24:39.899
- You do.
- I grew up as a white child,


393
00:24:40.067 --> 00:24:43.528
I heard much more talk against Democrats
than I did against black people.


394
00:24:44.071 --> 00:24:47.865
When he began Firing Line
he did it in part to show off.


395
00:24:48.033 --> 00:24:50.827
But he actually did just what
pundit television should do.


396
00:24:51.036 --> 00:24:54.247
Which is he elevated the discourse
and he educated people through it.


397
00:24:58.585 --> 00:25:01.462
On the eve of the Republican
Convention, the heat is on.


398
00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.048
We bring you a report
on who did what to whom


399
00:25:04.216 --> 00:25:05.717
in the last hours before the gavel.

400
00:25:05.884 --> 00:25:09.470
Plus commentary and some dissent
from our guest commentators:


401
00:25:09.638 --> 00:25:10.930
author Gore Vidal...

402
00:25:11.098 --> 00:25:13.182
ABC's unconventional
convention coverage


403
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.601
was a subject of ridicule

404
00:25:15.769 --> 00:25:19.314
as we were abdicating our
journalistic responsibility.


405
00:25:19.982 --> 00:25:23.860
But if the goal was to raise
ABC News' visibility,


406
00:25:24.528 --> 00:25:26.237
we certainly succeeded.

407
00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.532
Everybody watched the news.

408
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.827
Nearly 80 percent of the country
watched coverage


409
00:25:32.995 --> 00:25:35.705
of the Republican and Democratic
conventions in 1968.


410
00:25:38.375 --> 00:25:39.792
We're going live
to the West Coast


411
00:25:40.002 --> 00:25:41.544
in about six or seven minutes.

412
00:25:41.712 --> 00:25:44.756
And then, ABC News' studio collapsed.

413
00:25:54.308 --> 00:25:57.852
The lighting grid fell down
onto the floor of the set.


414
00:25:59.563 --> 00:26:01.230
And the roof fell in...
...literally.


415
00:26:01.398 --> 00:26:03.608
It was built inside the arena.

416
00:26:03.776 --> 00:26:05.193
Hard hats on.

417
00:26:05.611 --> 00:26:10.281
ABC was really the Budget car rental
of television news.


418
00:26:10.449 --> 00:26:14.285
Pieces of the ceiling start flying,
and then all of a sudden,


419
00:26:14.453 --> 00:26:16.621
the whole thing started giving away.

420
00:26:18.082 --> 00:26:20.583
Mr. Lower, ABC promised to be
unconventional this year


421
00:26:20.751 --> 00:26:24.587
- but this is ridiculous.
- We're gonna be unconventional, Sam.


422
00:26:24.671 --> 00:26:25.797
I can tell you that.

423
00:26:26.256 --> 00:26:28.508
Thank you very much.
Now let's just cut it.


424
00:26:41.105 --> 00:26:43.064
This is Miami, day one.

425
00:26:43.232 --> 00:26:46.484
From Miami Beach,
ABC News presents...


426
00:26:47.152 --> 00:26:49.028
Race to the White House.

427
00:26:50.155 --> 00:26:51.781
They did what they could.

428
00:26:51.949 --> 00:26:53.783
Basically, they hung a lot of drapes.

429
00:26:53.951 --> 00:26:56.619
Lit the set with C stands and lamps.

430
00:26:57.621 --> 00:26:59.497
Frankly, I think it was
an improvement.


431
00:26:59.665 --> 00:27:03.084
We would like now to demonstrate how
the English language ought to be used


432
00:27:03.252 --> 00:27:05.545
by two craftsmen,
our guest commentators.


433
00:27:05.712 --> 00:27:07.296
On the air in ten...

434
00:27:09.299 --> 00:27:14.262
If you view debate purely as sport,
let's call it blood sport.


435
00:27:15.305 --> 00:27:17.557
Then really, all bets are off.

436
00:27:17.724 --> 00:27:21.310
Nine, eight, seven, six.
Standby now!


437
00:27:22.646 --> 00:27:26.607
You have one objective,
and that's to win in that moment.


438
00:27:29.153 --> 00:27:33.030
When you attack
the position of your opponent,


439
00:27:33.198 --> 00:27:35.992
you have to first attack it
clinically and rationally.


440
00:27:37.369 --> 00:27:39.579
Six, five, four...

441
00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:43.875
But mostly what you have to get at
is what's behind those things.


442
00:27:44.042 --> 00:27:47.295
What is driving the human being
who is in front of you.


443
00:27:47.463 --> 00:27:51.007
...three, two, one.

444
00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.430
- Gore Vidal.
- Tonight, the key question


445
00:27:57.598 --> 00:28:00.141
for every patriot is

446
00:28:00.309 --> 00:28:04.604
"Can an aging, Hollywood, juvenile
actor with a right-wing script


447
00:28:04.771 --> 00:28:07.857
defeat Richard Nixon,
a professional politician


448
00:28:08.025 --> 00:28:12.737
who currently represents no
discernible interest except his own?"


449
00:28:13.614 --> 00:28:15.823
As of yesterday morning,
Ronald Regan says,


450
00:28:15.991 --> 00:28:17.700
"The only function of government

451
00:28:17.868 --> 00:28:21.412
is to get out of our way and leave us
alone as much as possible."


452
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:23.915
Now, on this occasion,
I'm afraid I have to agree


453
00:28:24.082 --> 00:28:26.667
with William Buckley,
the distinguished thinker,


454
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.127
when he says...

455
00:28:28.295 --> 00:28:31.130
My favorite quotation from you.
I have a treasury here.


456
00:28:31.298 --> 00:28:34.425
"Today as never before, the State
has the necessary instrument


457
00:28:34.593 --> 00:28:36.594
of our proximate deliverance."

458
00:28:36.762 --> 00:28:39.055
As usual, in your slightly Latinate
and inaccurate style.


459
00:28:39.223 --> 00:28:41.265
But you do feel,
as most of us do,


460
00:28:41.433 --> 00:28:45.228
that the State must
have some responsibility


461
00:28:45.395 --> 00:28:47.772
for what happens in the country.
And now you have Ronald Regan,


462
00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.440
whom you approve of,
who does not want to use


463
00:28:49.608 --> 00:28:51.317
the federal government
to do anything at all.


464
00:28:51.485 --> 00:28:54.862
Mr. Smith, I confess
that anything complicated


465
00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:56.489
confuses Mr. Vidal.

466
00:28:56.657 --> 00:28:58.991
This has been plain
for a very long time.


467
00:28:59.159 --> 00:29:02.036
He has a great difficulty
reconciling


468
00:29:02.204 --> 00:29:05.790
even axiomatic positions
concerning political philosophy,


469
00:29:05.958 --> 00:29:09.460
but we were treated to
Mr. Gore Vidal, the playwright.


470
00:29:10.128 --> 00:29:12.463
Saying that, after all,
Ronald Regan


471
00:29:12.631 --> 00:29:18.261
was nothing more than
an "aging Hollywood juvenile actor."


472
00:29:18.428 --> 00:29:21.138
Now, to begin with,
everybody's aging,


473
00:29:21.431 --> 00:29:24.308
- even Mr. Vidal. That's right.
- Even you are, Bill.


474
00:29:24.768 --> 00:29:27.061
- Perceptibly before our eyes.
- Then he said "Hollywood."


475
00:29:27.229 --> 00:29:29.814
Now, one has either
acted in Hollywood


476
00:29:29.982 --> 00:29:33.693
during the time Mr. Reagan acted,
or one didn't act at all.


477
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.988
Mr. Vidal sends all of his books
to Hollywood,


478
00:29:37.155 --> 00:29:38.739
many of which are rejected,

479
00:29:38.907 --> 00:29:40.700
but some of which
are ground out into--


480
00:29:40.867 --> 00:29:42.535
Bill, I never send any there.

481
00:29:42.703 --> 00:29:46.122
But he called him a juvenile actor
which is presumably


482
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:50.084
to be distinguished from
an adult actor. Now my point is--


483
00:29:50.252 --> 00:29:53.588
Buckley was
his generation's greatest debater.


484
00:29:54.214 --> 00:29:56.424
He knew very well
how to make an argument.


485
00:29:56.592 --> 00:30:01.137
What he was even better at was
dismantling your argument.


486
00:30:01.305 --> 00:30:04.515
- Now, I think this kind of--
- Now, Bill, I think...


487
00:30:05.225 --> 00:30:08.811
- Bill, if I may say so--
- ...as I think ABC has the right...


488
00:30:08.979 --> 00:30:11.897
Just as I think ABC has
the authority... I'm almost through.


489
00:30:12.065 --> 00:30:13.899
No, you're n... 
In every sense.

490
00:30:14.067 --> 00:30:15.443
Let Mr. Buckley finish his sentence.

491
00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:18.112
Then, Mr. Vidal,
I assure you time to refute it.


492
00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:23.409
If ABC has the authority to invite
the author of Myra Breckinridge


493
00:30:23.577 --> 00:30:26.662
to come and to comment
on Republican politics,


494
00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:29.707
I think that the people
of California have the right,


495
00:30:29.875 --> 00:30:32.126
when they speak overwhelmingly,
to project somebody


496
00:30:32.294 --> 00:30:35.963
into national politics
even if he did commit the sin


497
00:30:36.131 --> 00:30:41.302
of having acted in movies that
were not written by Mr. Vidal.


498
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:43.888
If Buckley was the great debater
of his time,


499
00:30:44.056 --> 00:30:46.724
Vidal was the great talker
of his time.


500
00:30:46.892 --> 00:30:48.934
Well, as usual, Mr. Buckley...

501
00:30:49.811 --> 00:30:52.563
with his enormous
and thrilling charm,


502
00:30:52.731 --> 00:30:56.025
manages to get away from the issue
toward the comedy.


503
00:30:56.735 --> 00:31:00.321
He's always to the right, I think,
and almost always in the wrong.


504
00:31:00.489 --> 00:31:04.033
And you certainly must, Bill,
maintain your reputation as being


505
00:31:04.201 --> 00:31:06.744
the Marie Antoinette
of the right wing


506
00:31:06.912 --> 00:31:10.331
and continually imposing your own
rather bloodthirsty neuroses


507
00:31:10.499 --> 00:31:13.167
on a political campaign.

508
00:31:13.335 --> 00:31:16.754
He also rehearsed his ad libs.

509
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.008
All the great bon mot
that he unleashed on the air


510
00:31:21.176 --> 00:31:24.220
he tried out first on the reporters
in the press room.


511
00:31:26.473 --> 00:31:30.309
So calling Buckley the
Marie Antoinette of the right wing


512
00:31:30.435 --> 00:31:32.895
he had done that
with a reporter beforehand.


513
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.939
This is the hobgoblinization

514
00:31:35.107 --> 00:31:37.233
- of the Marxists.
- Gentlemen, you have about


515
00:31:37.401 --> 00:31:41.195
one concluding sentence apiece.
Can you give us one?


516
00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:44.740
Well, I think that it is
something for which


517
00:31:44.908 --> 00:31:46.575
all of us have to be grateful,

518
00:31:46.743 --> 00:31:50.413
that there are left in America people
who believe in the democratic process


519
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.668
sufficiently to know that
occasionally people can penetrate


520
00:31:55.836 --> 00:32:01.382
such myths as have been energetically
projected by Mr. Vidal.


521
00:32:02.217 --> 00:32:06.762
Which would be not only a philosophy
in an economy of stagnation,


522
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:09.765
but also a spiritual world
of stagnation.


523
00:32:09.933 --> 00:32:12.643
Thank you very much indeed,
gentlemen. While...


524
00:32:12.811 --> 00:32:16.313
So these two guys were
circling each other early on.


525
00:32:16.481 --> 00:32:20.401
Why? Partly because each one
saw in the other


526
00:32:20.569 --> 00:32:25.614
a kind of exaggerated image of his
own anxious version of himself.


527
00:32:29.369 --> 00:32:31.871
It's almost as if they were
matter and anti-matter.


528
00:32:32.038 --> 00:32:34.540
Sort of parallel lives.

529
00:32:39.379 --> 00:32:42.590
They spoke with
these patrician languid accents.


530
00:32:42.758 --> 00:32:44.800
They'd both been to boarding schools.

531
00:32:44.968 --> 00:32:47.762
Very prestigious families
and backgrounds.


532
00:32:47.929 --> 00:32:49.096
So everyone thought.

533
00:32:49.681 --> 00:32:54.310
These were two guys who were not so
much of the Eastern establishment,


534
00:32:54.478 --> 00:32:57.396
as conquerors
of the Eastern establishment.


535
00:32:57.981 --> 00:33:00.733
Gore never went to college,

536
00:33:01.234 --> 00:33:03.903
which he was very proud of actually.

537
00:33:04.112 --> 00:33:05.863
We are savages, my family.

538
00:33:06.031 --> 00:33:08.115
Father was from the frontier.

539
00:33:09.534 --> 00:33:14.163
We didn't belong to Long Island
society, nor did we wish to.


540
00:33:15.624 --> 00:33:18.501
This has always been
an anti-intellectual country.


541
00:33:19.127 --> 00:33:23.047
These days, anybody who spoke
like those two men in public


542
00:33:23.215 --> 00:33:25.216
would be seen to be heartless.

543
00:33:25.634 --> 00:33:29.261
In fact, they're supposed to be what
American mass audience despises.


544
00:33:29.429 --> 00:33:32.473
They're intellectual.
They sound like elites.


545
00:33:32.641 --> 00:33:34.016
But people warmed to it.

546
00:33:34.184 --> 00:33:37.228
Mr. Buckley, do you think miniskirts
are in good taste?


547
00:33:37.395 --> 00:33:39.271
On you I think they are.

548
00:33:44.486 --> 00:33:46.612
- Those legs are in good taste.
- Great legs.


549
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.906
I never would've
figured you for that kind.


550
00:33:51.451 --> 00:33:53.202
Gore Vidal famously said,

551
00:33:53.411 --> 00:33:56.747
sex and appearing on television."

552
00:33:56.915 --> 00:33:58.415
- Go ahead, Gore.
- Joanne Woodward.


553
00:33:58.667 --> 00:34:00.960
Very good.
That's one down and nine to go.


554
00:34:02.879 --> 00:34:04.547
Hey, put on your--

555
00:34:04.714 --> 00:34:08.676
They both instinctually knew
about the power of television


556
00:34:08.844 --> 00:34:11.846
in a way that a lot of American
intellectuals of that era did not.


557
00:34:12.013 --> 00:34:14.807
Why don't you just talk to me instead
of talking to the audience?


558
00:34:14.975 --> 00:34:17.434
Well, by a curious thing,
we have not found ourselves


559
00:34:17.602 --> 00:34:20.563
in a friendly neighborhood bar,
but both by election are sitting here


560
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.648
with an audience.
So therefore it would be


561
00:34:22.816 --> 00:34:25.359
dishonest of us to pretend otherwise.

562
00:34:26.736 --> 00:34:29.613
Mr. Buckley, I've noticed that
whenever you appear on television,


563
00:34:29.781 --> 00:34:31.156
you're always seated.

564
00:34:31.366 --> 00:34:33.742
Does this mean
you can't think on your feet?


565
00:34:35.912 --> 00:34:38.873
It's very... very hard to stand up

566
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:42.376
carrying the...
the weight of what I know.


567
00:34:45.881 --> 00:34:50.593
They were both very much aware that
TV is the present and the future.


568
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.137
And you have to be on it
and you have to use it well.


569
00:35:04.983 --> 00:35:07.234
In a way, I think
the brilliant thing about Gore Vidal


570
00:35:07.402 --> 00:35:10.779
is he had opinions and he was willing
to air them and very, very bravely.


571
00:35:10.947 --> 00:35:13.282
I mean, this was the person that
wrote The City and the Pillar,


572
00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:15.409
published in 1948.

573
00:35:15.827 --> 00:35:18.871
It was the first novel
that dealt very openly...


574
00:35:20.457 --> 00:35:25.044
with homosexuality as being
a perfectly normal sexual activity.


575
00:35:26.671 --> 00:35:28.547
He was willing to take these risks

576
00:35:28.715 --> 00:35:33.218
that almost no one statistically
was ever willing to take.


577
00:35:33.762 --> 00:35:36.972
He deserved so much credit for that
that he does not get.


578
00:35:37.557 --> 00:35:40.601
You have your own narrow views
of what is correct sexual behavior.


579
00:35:40.769 --> 00:35:41.852
I happen to disagree with it

580
00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.646
and I think there are
a great many people who do.


581
00:35:43.813 --> 00:35:48.317
We cannot in any way encourage young
boys into this kind of relationship.


582
00:35:48.485 --> 00:35:51.028
You have every right to propagandize
from the pulpit,


583
00:35:51.196 --> 00:35:54.281
and give us the same right to
propagandize with books.


584
00:35:54.449 --> 00:35:56.659
I certainly am not gonna try
to shut down your church,


585
00:35:56.826 --> 00:35:59.078
as appalling
as I find your argument.


586
00:35:59.245 --> 00:36:01.622
Vidal's view is that sexual
orientation


587
00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:06.085
amongst civilized humans
is not named, discussed, or labeled.


588
00:36:08.046 --> 00:36:11.924
Gore Vidal would never
answer to the question:


589
00:36:12.092 --> 00:36:14.885
Are you gay?
"Yes, I'm gay."


590
00:36:16.763 --> 00:36:19.682
You have to understand
that Gore was obsessed


591
00:36:19.891 --> 00:36:22.434
with shedding sexual labels.

592
00:36:23.728 --> 00:36:25.312
It is as natural
to be homosexual


593
00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.730
as it is to be heterosexual.

594
00:36:26.898 --> 00:36:29.566
And the difference between a
homosexual and a heterosexual


595
00:36:29.734 --> 00:36:31.485
is about the difference between
somebody who has brown eyes


596
00:36:31.653 --> 00:36:33.320
- and somebody who has blue eyes.
- Who says so?


597
00:36:33.488 --> 00:36:36.949
I say so. It is a completely natural
act from the beginning of time.


598
00:36:37.784 --> 00:36:41.370
The morays of the country
are going to hell.


599
00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:44.373
And if there was one thing
William Buckley cared more about


600
00:36:44.541 --> 00:36:46.333
than anything,
it would have been that.


601
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:48.877
We go on like this,
abortion will be on demand.


602
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:52.548
Women will have sex with women.
The family will be over.


603
00:36:52.716 --> 00:36:54.550
The church won't be respected.

604
00:36:54.718 --> 00:36:57.678
People will be screwing in the
street, frightening the horses.


605
00:36:57.846 --> 00:36:59.638
Buggery will be legal.

606
00:37:00.473 --> 00:37:04.393
And if you'd said all that to Gore,
he'd have said, "Okay, bring it on."


607
00:37:08.023 --> 00:37:11.316
In a very moving piece
called "A Blow for Peace,"


608
00:37:11.484 --> 00:37:13.986
in that magazine I will not mention,

609
00:37:14.154 --> 00:37:16.530
on the 29th of December, 1964--

610
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.116
We know that you'd like nothing
to sully your lips.


611
00:37:19.325 --> 00:37:22.661
You came out...
You will eat it first.


612
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:28.500
You came out in favor of history
at H for such an act of greatness.


613
00:37:28.668 --> 00:37:31.253
That is the bombing of the Chinese
nuclear capacity.


614
00:37:31.421 --> 00:37:33.547
Mr. Vidal, I have no doubt
that there are...


615
00:37:33.715 --> 00:37:36.258
there is somebody in
Haight-Ashbury or Greenwich Village


616
00:37:36.426 --> 00:37:40.262
who considers that your caricature
is fetching. I don't.


617
00:37:40.513 --> 00:37:43.932
I was invited here and
am prepared to try to talk about


618
00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.976
- the Republican Convention.
- Yes.


619
00:37:46.144 --> 00:37:48.270
But I maintain that
it's very difficult to do so


620
00:37:48.438 --> 00:37:52.191
when you have somebody like this
who speaks in such verse


621
00:37:52.358 --> 00:37:54.693
and he likes to be naughty.

622
00:37:54.861 --> 00:37:56.737
Which has proved to be
a professionally


623
00:37:56.905 --> 00:37:58.697
highly merchandisable vice.

624
00:37:58.865 --> 00:38:02.076
Not unlike your so public vices
and wickedness.


625
00:38:03.244 --> 00:38:07.706
We have to keep in mind
the left-wing was never hesitant


626
00:38:07.874 --> 00:38:10.167
about smearing anybody
from the right-wing.


627
00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.046
That was a battle
Bill had to fight all the time.


628
00:38:14.214 --> 00:38:17.216
The disease of the right
is greed, bigotry,


629
00:38:17.467 --> 00:38:19.885
insensitivity and general stupidity.

630
00:38:20.053 --> 00:38:22.221
On a radio interview,
you said that you thought


631
00:38:22.472 --> 00:38:25.724
"the Jews tend to construct ongoing
political myth centered around


632
00:38:25.892 --> 00:38:28.519
the Hitlerian experience,
which more or less suggests


633
00:38:28.686 --> 00:38:30.604
that Hitler was the embodiment
of the ultra-right."


634
00:38:30.772 --> 00:38:34.441
True. Most Jews suggest Hitler was
the embodiment of the ultra-right.


635
00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:36.610
He certainly wasn't the embodiment
of the ultra-left.


636
00:38:36.778 --> 00:38:40.405
And do you care to read the context,
or shall I cram it down your throat?


637
00:38:40.573 --> 00:38:41.615
No, no, no.

638
00:38:41.783 --> 00:38:43.575
If you are a right-winger,

639
00:38:43.743 --> 00:38:46.370
you don't want to have
anything to do with


640
00:38:46.538 --> 00:38:50.207
the Gnostic heresies
of Nazism and Fascism.


641
00:38:50.959 --> 00:38:54.795
And that was a label that the
left-wing kept trying to pin


642
00:38:55.004 --> 00:38:56.421
on the right-wing.

643
00:38:58.258 --> 00:39:00.926
Which is the cherry bomb
that is waiting to go off.


644
00:39:01.094 --> 00:39:03.428
And eventually does.

645
00:39:06.391 --> 00:39:08.016
Good evening from Miami Beach.

646
00:39:08.184 --> 00:39:11.854
Again we bring you in 90 minutes
all that's worth seeing and knowing


647
00:39:12.021 --> 00:39:15.399
as the convention's moment of truth
comes near.


648
00:39:21.447 --> 00:39:23.031
- Can you hear me?
- Yes!


649
00:39:23.783 --> 00:39:25.409
I said "rich America!"

650
00:39:27.287 --> 00:39:28.495
Quiet!

651
00:39:30.623 --> 00:39:33.709
Never has obedience to law

652
00:39:33.877 --> 00:39:37.045
been so disdained.

653
00:39:37.797 --> 00:39:40.465
In 1968, you see the beginning

654
00:39:40.633 --> 00:39:43.051
of a Republican kind of rhetoric

655
00:39:43.219 --> 00:39:47.097
in which strategies of dividing
the country racially


656
00:39:47.265 --> 00:39:51.685
are disguised with language
along the lines of law and order.


657
00:39:51.978 --> 00:39:54.438
Let's make America first again,

658
00:39:54.606 --> 00:39:56.940
in respect for order
and justice under law.


659
00:39:57.150 --> 00:39:58.859
Now, isn't that what you want?!

660
00:39:59.068 --> 00:40:01.028
Isn't that where
we're going to go?


661
00:40:01.946 --> 00:40:04.907
You wanted law and order
in this town. You've got it.


662
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.159
He's bluffing, boys. 
Let's get him.

663
00:40:09.662 --> 00:40:12.289
The next one gets a load of buckshot.
Any takers?


664
00:40:14.209 --> 00:40:17.628
Must we avoid
our great cities by night,


665
00:40:18.087 --> 00:40:23.383
as if they were guerilla-infested
hamlets out in Vietnam?


666
00:40:23.551 --> 00:40:24.760
No!

667
00:40:24.928 --> 00:40:26.678
10-27, we're setting up.

668
00:40:26.846 --> 00:40:31.058
There was a racial
protest that turned into a riot


669
00:40:31.226 --> 00:40:33.185
at the convention in Miami.

670
00:40:35.271 --> 00:40:38.649
These were two visions
of America clashing.


671
00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.984
Don't give me any
of that crap. Turn around.


672
00:40:41.361 --> 00:40:44.446
Look at that man back there.
You wanna look? Look at that picture.


673
00:40:44.614 --> 00:40:48.033
To be sure, this might have been
a trick by the lily-white climate


674
00:40:48.201 --> 00:40:51.203
of the Republican Convention
which is in progress right now


675
00:40:51.371 --> 00:40:52.955
just a few miles from here.

676
00:40:55.291 --> 00:41:00.921
The fault lines in our politics
were decided in the 1968 election.


677
00:41:01.589 --> 00:41:05.092
Alliances that connect
in shifting ways.


678
00:41:05.718 --> 00:41:09.721
Racial, religious, socio-economic.

679
00:41:09.889 --> 00:41:13.308
What we now call "identity politics"
was being formed then.


680
00:41:13.893 --> 00:41:17.437
And Buckley knew it, because to
some extent he'd helped create it.


681
00:41:21.401 --> 00:41:24.069
The subject for William
Buckley and Gore Vidal tonight:


682
00:41:24.237 --> 00:41:25.779
"Beyond the Nominations."

683
00:41:25.947 --> 00:41:29.199
What issues can the Republicans use
effectively to win?


684
00:41:29.367 --> 00:41:31.159
Well, I think two primarily.

685
00:41:31.327 --> 00:41:33.996
law and order.

686
00:41:34.163 --> 00:41:36.999
I wish there was a way of saying
"law and order"


687
00:41:37.166 --> 00:41:39.668
that didn't make critics say,

688
00:41:39.836 --> 00:41:41.712
"You're talking about
the racial question."


689
00:41:41.963 --> 00:41:46.008
I would like to know how to say
"law and order" by other means,


690
00:41:46.175 --> 00:41:47.926
but still mean law and order.

691
00:41:48.094 --> 00:41:52.055
And one of the problems that we face,
and that Nixon's gonna face, is this.


692
00:41:52.223 --> 00:41:54.266
What do we do about the growth

693
00:41:54.434 --> 00:41:58.687
of really mutinous members
of the American community?


694
00:41:58.855 --> 00:42:00.689
These people have got to be faced
not only politically,


695
00:42:00.857 --> 00:42:02.190
but philosophically.

696
00:42:02.358 --> 00:42:05.152
And this is something which,
in my judgment, Mr. Nixon


697
00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:10.282
has got to elevate into the status
of the genuine national debate.


698
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:13.660
I think that if Richard Nixon
were elected President,


699
00:42:13.828 --> 00:42:16.705
it would be an absolute,
no matter with what good will,


700
00:42:17.332 --> 00:42:20.459
it would be a disaster because
the young, the black, the poor


701
00:42:20.626 --> 00:42:24.212
are disaffected and I don't see him
ever drawing them to him.


702
00:42:24.839 --> 00:42:28.216
Vidal understood what
it meant to take the positions that


703
00:42:28.384 --> 00:42:32.846
William F. Buckley, Jr. took towards
civil rights during those years.


704
00:42:33.931 --> 00:42:38.393
This was at a time when political
leaders had been able to block


705
00:42:38.561 --> 00:42:41.438
civil rights legislations
with the support


706
00:42:41.606 --> 00:42:44.107
of entities like
the National Review


707
00:42:44.275 --> 00:42:46.985
and figures like
William F. Buckley Jr.


708
00:42:48.279 --> 00:42:50.947
In the United States,
five percent of the population


709
00:42:51.115 --> 00:42:52.741
have 20 percent of the income.

710
00:42:52.909 --> 00:42:55.869
And the bottom 20 percent
have five percent of the income.


711
00:42:56.037 --> 00:42:58.872
- I think this is irrelevant.
- I know that you revel


712
00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:03.627
in this kind of inequality.
Your business is based upon that.


713
00:43:03.795 --> 00:43:06.880
I believe that freedom
breeds our inequality.


714
00:43:07.048 --> 00:43:08.507
Say that again?

715
00:43:08.674 --> 00:43:11.134
Freedom breeds inequality.

716
00:43:11.302 --> 00:43:13.970
- I'll say it a third time.
- No, twice was enough.


717
00:43:14.263 --> 00:43:16.681
- I think you made your point.
- Unless you have freedom


718
00:43:16.849 --> 00:43:19.810
to be unequal,
there is no such thing as freedom.


719
00:43:19.977 --> 00:43:24.189
And with Buckley, you see
a shrill defense of what he sees


720
00:43:24.357 --> 00:43:27.776
as a completely collapsing
social and cultural order.


721
00:43:28.986 --> 00:43:30.862
- What can I say?
- Not much.


722
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:34.241
You've given that
ghastly position once again


723
00:43:34.784 --> 00:43:37.828
of the well to-do
and those who inherit money


724
00:43:37.995 --> 00:43:39.746
and believe that others
who do not...


725
00:43:39.914 --> 00:43:44.793
- This is balderdash.
- ...must somehow achieve equality.


726
00:43:44.961 --> 00:43:48.338
But, in actual fact,
you're going to have a revolution,


727
00:43:48.506 --> 00:43:50.674
if you don't give the people
the things they want.


728
00:43:50.842 --> 00:43:52.717
Now, I'm putting it
to your own self-interest,


729
00:43:52.885 --> 00:43:54.719
they're going to come
and take it away from you.


730
00:43:56.806 --> 00:43:58.849
Because Vidal is so educated,

731
00:43:59.016 --> 00:44:01.726
and so one of his class,

732
00:44:01.894 --> 00:44:04.354
for Buckley,
the betrayal of those values


733
00:44:04.522 --> 00:44:06.273
seems to be almost personal.

734
00:44:07.525 --> 00:44:09.776
Buckley, he didn't believe
in democracy.


735
00:44:10.528 --> 00:44:14.072
He believed in rule by elites,
starting with him.


736
00:44:24.250 --> 00:44:26.543
The conservative party
in New York state


737
00:44:26.711 --> 00:44:29.379
had gone to Buckley and said,
"Put your money where your mouth is.


738
00:44:29.547 --> 00:44:31.214
Run for mayor."

739
00:44:32.717 --> 00:44:35.677
So it was Bill Buckley,
the conservative candidate,


740
00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:40.056
and John Lindsay, the darling
of liberal Republicans,


741
00:44:40.224 --> 00:44:42.934
whom Buckley was intent on defeating.

742
00:44:43.352 --> 00:44:45.145
He has said
that you're out to destroy


743
00:44:45.354 --> 00:44:46.855
everything that he stands for.

744
00:44:47.023 --> 00:44:48.815
That is roughly correct.
I couldn't have put it better.


745
00:44:48.983 --> 00:44:50.650
I'm out to destroy
everything that he stands for:


746
00:44:50.818 --> 00:44:52.527
hypocrisy and ultra-leftism.

747
00:44:55.323 --> 00:44:58.241
Conservatism
in America is an insurgency.


748
00:45:00.786 --> 00:45:04.247
It's not the right
fighting the far left,


749
00:45:04.415 --> 00:45:09.294
it's the right fighting people
who are not quite far enough right.


750
00:45:10.922 --> 00:45:15.425
Buckley discovered a new constituency
for the Republican party.


751
00:45:15.593 --> 00:45:18.345
It was angry white ethnics

752
00:45:18.513 --> 00:45:20.514
in Brooklyn, in Queens,

753
00:45:20.681 --> 00:45:23.099
in Staten Island,
in the outer boroughs.


754
00:45:23.267 --> 00:45:26.770
The same people who voted
for Goldwater in '64


755
00:45:26.938 --> 00:45:31.233
at a time of mounting
racial unrest in America.


756
00:45:31.984 --> 00:45:33.985
The conservatives,
more than 1,200 of them,


757
00:45:34.153 --> 00:45:37.656
paid one dollar each
to see William F. Buckley Jr.


758
00:45:38.032 --> 00:45:40.116
There was nothing fancy
on the menu here.


759
00:45:40.284 --> 00:45:41.952
Just hot tongue and cold shoulder

760
00:45:42.119 --> 00:45:44.371
for everything distasteful
to the conservatives.


761
00:45:44.539 --> 00:45:47.791
Ladies and gentlemen, the
apparent winner of this election...


762
00:45:49.126 --> 00:45:51.336
is Mr. John Lindsay.

763
00:45:55.007 --> 00:45:58.051
He was realistic enough in 1965

764
00:45:58.219 --> 00:46:00.178
to realize that he could not win.

765
00:46:00.346 --> 00:46:05.100
What has made a difference is that
thanks to your efforts,


766
00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:10.105
we have begun to reintroduce the
two-party system to New York City.


767
00:46:11.482 --> 00:46:13.567
What Buckley had found
all through his career,


768
00:46:13.734 --> 00:46:15.860
he wrote about this when he was
still a fairly young man,


769
00:46:16.028 --> 00:46:18.989
is he said,
"I lose all the big battles,


770
00:46:19.156 --> 00:46:21.324
but I win all the small,
personal ones."


771
00:46:22.785 --> 00:46:24.494
He said it with kind of frustration.

772
00:46:24.912 --> 00:46:29.207
What he wanted to do
was to win the big war.


773
00:46:31.085 --> 00:46:35.589
The next president of
the United States, Richard Nixon!


774
00:46:39.385 --> 00:46:40.719
Bill Buckley says,

775
00:46:40.886 --> 00:46:44.180
"This election, it'll be decided
on the issue of law and order."


776
00:46:45.766 --> 00:46:47.225
And he was right.

777
00:46:50.688 --> 00:46:54.899
What is on people's minds,
what frightens them


778
00:46:55.067 --> 00:46:58.612
is the fear that a generation that,
by the New Deal,


779
00:46:58.779 --> 00:47:03.783
was put into the middle class is now
going to lose all of those gains.


780
00:47:05.745 --> 00:47:08.496
These are the debates
we're having today.


781
00:47:16.297 --> 00:47:18.089
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

782
00:47:18.257 --> 00:47:20.425
You'll certainly be back,
I'm delighted to know,


783
00:47:20.593 --> 00:47:23.136
for the Democratic Convention,
where Mr. Buckley may attack


784
00:47:23.304 --> 00:47:25.972
and Mr. Vidal will have to defend.

785
00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:28.183
We'll be back after this message.

786
00:47:31.354 --> 00:47:33.271
♪ ♪

787
00:47:36.025 --> 00:47:38.526
ABC was very happy
with the coverage.


788
00:47:39.695 --> 00:47:42.906
When you talk about Buckley-Vidal,
people took notice.


789
00:47:43.074 --> 00:47:45.116
And they got noticed in the press.

790
00:47:45.284 --> 00:47:49.537
That was very important in 1968
to everybody in television.


791
00:47:50.873 --> 00:47:54.668
It turned out that
this was kind of a hit.


792
00:47:55.127 --> 00:47:58.004
"About the only fun to be had
during the GOP convention,


793
00:47:58.172 --> 00:48:00.173
from a television observer's
point of view,


794
00:48:00.341 --> 00:48:02.258
was found
in the nightly tête-à-tête


795
00:48:02.426 --> 00:48:04.219
between William F. Buckley
and Gore Vidal."


796
00:48:06.097 --> 00:48:10.058
I'm never sure whether
politics leads what argument is,


797
00:48:10.226 --> 00:48:12.227
or argument leads what politics is.

798
00:48:12.895 --> 00:48:18.441
But together, Buckley and Vidal
are enormously successful.


799
00:48:24.949 --> 00:48:28.368
I've always tried to keep my
political life and my literary life


800
00:48:28.536 --> 00:48:29.744
somewhat apart.

801
00:48:29.912 --> 00:48:32.997
But in 1959,
I decided to bring the two together


802
00:48:33.165 --> 00:48:35.917
in a play that became a film.

803
00:48:37.545 --> 00:48:40.588
Gore does have a sense
of a deep America and a deep history.


804
00:48:41.465 --> 00:48:43.174
He's written The Best Man.

805
00:48:44.927 --> 00:48:47.679
The best play ever written about
an American political convention.


806
00:48:48.222 --> 00:48:51.099
Do you think people mistrust
intellectuals like you in politics?


807
00:48:51.267 --> 00:48:53.893
Intellectual?
You mean I wrote a book?


808
00:48:55.271 --> 00:48:56.688
Well, as Bertram Russell said,

809
00:48:56.856 --> 00:48:59.399
"People in a democracy tend to think
they have less to fear


810
00:48:59.567 --> 00:49:01.901
from a stupid man
than an intelligent one.


811
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:04.696
Actually, it's the other way around.
It's the stupid man--"


812
00:49:04.864 --> 00:49:10.285
Vidal's interest in politics
was not only ideological.


813
00:49:10.661 --> 00:49:13.913
It was a very personal
and social thing.


814
00:49:14.123 --> 00:49:16.750
What image do you feel Senator
Campbell is projecting at the moment?


815
00:49:16.917 --> 00:49:18.626
I'm afraid I don't know
anything about images.


816
00:49:18.794 --> 00:49:21.421
That's a term from advertising where
you don't try to sell a product,


817
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:23.923
you sell the image of the product.
Sometimes, the image is a fake!


818
00:49:24.091 --> 00:49:27.135
- After all, your own image is--
- A poor thing, but mine own.


819
00:49:27.303 --> 00:49:29.471
Paint me as I am, wart and all.

820
00:49:29.638 --> 00:49:31.806
Gore was born
into a political family.


821
00:49:31.974 --> 00:49:34.517
He's the grandson of a senator,
T.P. Gore of Oklahoma.


822
00:49:34.685 --> 00:49:36.478
His father was
in the Roosevelt administration.


823
00:49:36.645 --> 00:49:40.315
He saw himself as the heir
to this political dynasty.


824
00:49:40.483 --> 00:49:42.275
And he was going to be
the greatest of them all.


825
00:49:48.699 --> 00:49:50.575
Candidate Gore Vidal.

826
00:49:50.743 --> 00:49:53.703
Most of my plays,
most of my writing is political


827
00:49:53.913 --> 00:49:56.456
or in criticism of society,
should we say.


828
00:49:56.999 --> 00:49:59.876
Actually, for a change I'm getting
out and trying to do something.


829
00:50:01.170 --> 00:50:04.798
When Gore ran for Congress
from upstate New York in 1960,


830
00:50:04.965 --> 00:50:08.134
he saw it as the first stepping stone
to the Presidency.


831
00:50:10.596 --> 00:50:13.223
He doesn't exactly
have the common touch.


832
00:50:13.766 --> 00:50:16.976
He's not exactly someone
who's going to appeal


833
00:50:17.186 --> 00:50:21.022
to the working class voters
of the United States of America.


834
00:50:23.984 --> 00:50:28.655
He had a sense of himself
as being equal to and belonging


835
00:50:28.823 --> 00:50:32.826
in the world of
the powerful and the elite.


836
00:50:34.537 --> 00:50:37.163
Gore and Jackie Kennedy
were related by marriage.


837
00:50:37.331 --> 00:50:41.125
And Jack Kennedy gave campaign
appearances for him.


838
00:50:41.293 --> 00:50:43.253
He was on the Kennedy ticket.

839
00:50:45.047 --> 00:50:48.383
He was a welcome visitor
at the White House


840
00:50:48.551 --> 00:50:52.011
until there was a run-in
with Bobby Kennedy.


841
00:50:53.973 --> 00:50:56.182
This will sound absurd
with hindsight,


842
00:50:56.350 --> 00:51:00.144
but he probably saw Bobby Kennedy
as competition for the presidency


843
00:51:00.312 --> 00:51:01.980
later in the 60's.

844
00:51:02.147 --> 00:51:05.066
And that's one reason
Gore didn't like Bobby.


845
00:51:05.484 --> 00:51:08.528
Bobby Kennedy is neither liberal,
nor is he much of anything


846
00:51:08.696 --> 00:51:11.823
except a political opportunist
like most of them.


847
00:51:12.157 --> 00:51:14.200
The whole thing has been taken over
by this camera,


848
00:51:14.368 --> 00:51:19.622
by people projecting images,
a ghastly word, and it's...


849
00:51:20.374 --> 00:51:22.208
These are the cards
with which we play.


850
00:51:24.003 --> 00:51:28.131
Bobby Kennedy immediately took
a dislike to Gore Vidal.


851
00:51:28.299 --> 00:51:31.593
Thought he was pompous,
thought he was arrogant.


852
00:51:32.678 --> 00:51:33.928
What is your
current relationship


853
00:51:34.138 --> 00:51:36.890
with Mrs. Onassis, your stepsister?

854
00:51:37.308 --> 00:51:39.559
I haven't seen her since 1962.

855
00:51:39.727 --> 00:51:41.853
There's no reason
for our lines to cross.


856
00:51:42.021 --> 00:51:44.981
She was devoted to Bobby Kennedy,
and I was, as you know, plainly not.


857
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:47.233
And we fell out over that.

858
00:51:52.531 --> 00:51:54.866
When Gore lost
the race for Congress,


859
00:51:55.326 --> 00:51:58.620
that led to not only a
disillusionment with politics,


860
00:51:58.787 --> 00:52:01.748
but a disillusionment
with the United States.


861
00:52:04.084 --> 00:52:05.585
Naturally,
I wanted to be a politician,


862
00:52:05.753 --> 00:52:07.545
but unfortunately
I was born a writer.


863
00:52:07.838 --> 00:52:13.259
And I would not say that
I've exactly had the life I wanted.


864
00:52:15.387 --> 00:52:17.639
Most of Vidal's work
is done at Ravello


865
00:52:17.806 --> 00:52:19.223
from the Sorrentine coast,

866
00:52:19.558 --> 00:52:23.102
amid lemon groves and vineyards,

867
00:52:24.605 --> 00:52:27.857
His house is improbably perched
above a precipice.


868
00:52:28.025 --> 00:52:31.778
The ideal spot, as he would say,
to observe the decline of the West.


869
00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:37.617
Playboy After Dark,
show number 15.


870
00:52:37.785 --> 00:52:39.035
Take one.

871
00:52:48.629 --> 00:52:52.382
Mr. Vidal, will you please sign
my copy of Myra Breckinridge?


872
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:55.718
With great pleasure, with my
extra-special William Buckley pen.


873
00:52:57.221 --> 00:52:59.973
I wouldn't be seen without this pen.

874
00:53:01.058 --> 00:53:03.351
- I think this is the property--
- A gift from Bill.


875
00:53:03.519 --> 00:53:06.396
A gift from Bill?
Bill's not as nice as he looks.


876
00:53:06.563 --> 00:53:08.064
I know Bill personally.

877
00:53:08.816 --> 00:53:11.067
- I know both sides of him.
- That's the best way to know him.


878
00:53:11.527 --> 00:53:13.027
Personally.

879
00:53:20.077 --> 00:53:22.537
In the interval
between Miami and Chicago,


880
00:53:22.705 --> 00:53:24.664
I read Myra Breckinridge.

881
00:53:25.207 --> 00:53:27.959
It attempts heuristic allegory,
but fails,


882
00:53:28.127 --> 00:53:30.837
giving gratification only
to sadist homosexuals


883
00:53:31.005 --> 00:53:34.716
and challenge only to
taxonomists of perversion.


884
00:53:36.635 --> 00:53:38.094
I thought and thought about it.

885
00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:40.763
There is nothing left to say
about Myra.


886
00:53:45.227 --> 00:53:47.061
And so we met again,
in Chicago.


887
00:53:54.194 --> 00:53:57.613
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman...


888
00:53:59.491 --> 00:54:02.660
Good evening from the
International Amphitheater in Chicago.


889
00:54:02.828 --> 00:54:05.246
There are almost as many problems
still to be solved


890
00:54:05.414 --> 00:54:07.206
as there are flies
in this building


891
00:54:07.374 --> 00:54:10.460
located in the heart
of Chicago's stockyards.


892
00:54:16.592 --> 00:54:18.926
The cheery welcome sign
that is everywhere here


893
00:54:19.178 --> 00:54:21.637
is as much a command
as an invitation.


894
00:54:22.306 --> 00:54:24.724
Mayor Daley
has beautified everywhere.


895
00:54:24.975 --> 00:54:30.271
What he cannot beautify,
he's tried to hide behind new fences.


896
00:54:31.065 --> 00:54:33.816
Part of the tightest security checks
an American city


897
00:54:33.984 --> 00:54:36.819
not under riot conditions
has ever experienced.


898
00:54:37.154 --> 00:54:40.406
We want Eugene!
We want Eugene!


899
00:54:41.241 --> 00:54:45.286
Eugene McCarthy and Hubert
Humphrey arrived in Chicago today.


900
00:54:45.788 --> 00:54:48.790
The Democratic party
was in terrific disarray.


901
00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:53.961
Bobby Kennedy had just been killed
a couple of months earlier.


902
00:54:54.129 --> 00:54:56.714
He was already becoming a martyr.

903
00:54:59.218 --> 00:55:02.053
The fight over the Democratic
platform will move here,


904
00:55:02.221 --> 00:55:03.971
right onto the floor
of this convention


905
00:55:04.556 --> 00:55:06.599
demanding a repudiation
and a reversal


906
00:55:06.767 --> 00:55:09.727
of the Johnson administration
policies on Vietnam.


907
00:55:11.688 --> 00:55:14.941
At this moment, it is
the calm in the eye of the storm.


908
00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:21.697
Their wounds have had time to heal
since Miami Beach.


909
00:55:21.865 --> 00:55:24.951
They've had time to restock their
arsenal for new assaults.


910
00:55:25.119 --> 00:55:28.037
"They," of course,
are William Buckley and Gore Vidal.


911
00:55:29.373 --> 00:55:32.166
Mr. Vidal, do you feel more
comfortable, philosophically, here


912
00:55:32.334 --> 00:55:33.835
than you did in Miami?

913
00:55:34.336 --> 00:55:38.005
Philosophically. I wonder if that
word will ever be used again


914
00:55:38.382 --> 00:55:39.590
while we're here in Chicago.

915
00:55:40.384 --> 00:55:43.511
This place is a shambles.
It's a police state.


916
00:55:44.388 --> 00:55:46.722
One's aware of the horrors
of the world here:


917
00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:48.307
the smell of old blood,

918
00:55:48.475 --> 00:55:51.394
the shrieking of the pigs as
they're slaughtered in the morning,


919
00:55:51.562 --> 00:55:54.897
all this reminds one of...
of life and death.


920
00:55:55.357 --> 00:55:57.859
So, in a sense,
I do feel at home in a way,


921
00:55:58.026 --> 00:55:59.777
but not happy.

922
00:56:00.737 --> 00:56:04.323
Buckley realized
he had his intellectual equal


923
00:56:04.491 --> 00:56:05.992
sitting right next to him.

924
00:56:06.869 --> 00:56:08.911
Vidal had done
the homework in Miami.


925
00:56:09.371 --> 00:56:11.205
By the time we got to Chicago,

926
00:56:11.498 --> 00:56:14.292
Buckley had caught up
and done some homework as well.


927
00:56:14.877 --> 00:56:17.295
William Buckley,
while on the defensive in Miami,


928
00:56:17.462 --> 00:56:18.838
may now take the offensive.

929
00:56:19.006 --> 00:56:21.549
He was also
an extremely aggressive debater.


930
00:56:21.884 --> 00:56:26.387
And so he thought that justified
every technique he could use to win.


931
00:56:27.306 --> 00:56:31.142
As a matter of
testamentary integrity,


932
00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:34.896
I reveal a concrete proposal
contained in a letter


933
00:56:35.063 --> 00:56:38.774
sent to me by Senator Kennedy
about six months ago.


934
00:56:39.234 --> 00:56:41.485
The P.S. of which was:

935
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:45.573
"I have changed
my platform from 1968


936
00:56:45.741 --> 00:56:47.825
from 'let's give blood
to the Viet Kong'


937
00:56:47.993 --> 00:56:50.703
to 'let's give Gore Vidal
to the Viet Kong."'


938
00:56:50.871 --> 00:56:52.496
May I see that? Really?

939
00:56:52.664 --> 00:56:55.208
I think, however,
that would be immoderate.


940
00:56:55.459 --> 00:56:59.045
In any case,
I do share Mr. Kennedy--


941
00:56:59.213 --> 00:57:03.424
- I must say.
- Mr. Kennedy's notion that Mr. Vidal


942
00:57:03.717 --> 00:57:06.510
is marred by his sort of
strange fantasies


943
00:57:06.678 --> 00:57:09.263
concerning the realisms of politics.

944
00:57:10.474 --> 00:57:13.893
We all recognize that moment
when we reach for a weapon


945
00:57:14.061 --> 00:57:16.729
that we know is sort of off-bounds.

946
00:57:16.897 --> 00:57:19.315
- This is Senator Bobby Kennedy.
- Yes, I realized.


947
00:57:19.483 --> 00:57:22.443
What a very curious handwriting.
It also slants up.


948
00:57:22.611 --> 00:57:24.153
Sign of a manic depressive.

949
00:57:24.529 --> 00:57:26.239
You still mad about Senator Kennedy?

950
00:57:26.782 --> 00:57:28.866
I did say that.
Whether you forged it or not,


951
00:57:29.034 --> 00:57:31.619
I don't know and I will have to have
my handwriting experts,


952
00:57:31.787 --> 00:57:34.622
the graphologists will have to look
at it. I put nothing beyond you.


953
00:57:35.249 --> 00:57:38.251
But to get back to the plank
while we...


954
00:57:38.418 --> 00:57:41.629
It's been fun inspecting your
correspondence, but...


955
00:57:41.797 --> 00:57:44.757
Vidal is relatively unfazed.

956
00:57:44.925 --> 00:57:47.093
He had almost a Zen technique.

957
00:57:48.011 --> 00:57:50.554
You let the guy lean forward
so that he falls over.


958
00:57:51.390 --> 00:57:54.809

there was more spectacle to be had.

ABC crew cars were equipped

How do we get out?
Have we really been beaten?

What matters here is that we have,
in a word, lost the war.


981
00:59:34.618 --> 00:59:37.119
Something like 90 percent of
the casualties are civilians.


982
00:59:37.287 --> 00:59:40.498
So when they accuse us of genocide,
they are not without point.

- Now, wait a minute.
- We've nothing to gain by this war.

We have not lost the war in Vietnam.

985
00:59:46.505 --> 00:59:51.509
What we have lost is an opportunity
to press that war


986
00:59:51.676 --> 00:59:54.845
with such weapons as are
especially at our disposal.

belong with me,

while you go to Rome
and expatriate yourself.


991
01:00:06.316 --> 01:00:08.859
I think we should
straighten this out now.


992
01:00:09.027 --> 01:00:11.195
I don't expatriate myself.
I have an apartment in Rome.


993
01:00:11.363 --> 01:00:14.657
I go there for two or three months
every year to be close to the Vatican


994
01:00:14.825 --> 01:00:18.244
to contemplate William Buckley
and his mad activities back here.


995
01:00:18.412 --> 01:00:19.829
And with enormous serenity,

996
01:00:20.038 --> 01:00:21.163
they're trying to get us, Bill.

997
01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:26.168
And I think, to be perfectly bleak,
and to be perfectly blunt,


998
01:00:26.336 --> 01:00:29.130
I think we're headed
for total disaster, this empire,


999
01:00:29.297 --> 01:00:32.383
with people like Mr. Buckley here
beating the drum.


1000
01:00:32.551 --> 01:00:35.553
And I think the instinct of the
people I used to think was for peace.


1001
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.097
I think it, now I come back and
I see little American flags


1002
01:00:38.265 --> 01:00:39.306
on the antenna of the car.

1003
01:00:39.474 --> 01:00:40.641
They're getting ready
for a war.


1004
01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:41.767
They're getting ready for war.

1005
01:00:47.441 --> 01:00:50.192
What Vidal saw
was that the American empire


1006
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:53.112
was completely overextended.

1007
01:00:55.949 --> 01:00:59.660
These empires are
very dangerous things to possess,


1008
01:00:59.828 --> 01:01:01.662
as Pericles once pointed out.

1009
01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:04.915
And once you get one,
it's very difficult to let it go.


1010
01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:07.710
But if we don't let it go,
it's going to wreck us economically.


1011
01:01:07.878 --> 01:01:08.502
We're already in trouble.

1012
01:01:08.503 --> 01:01:09.211
We're already in trouble.

1013
01:01:09.379 --> 01:01:11.630
And it has certainly divided
the country at a time


1014
01:01:11.798 --> 01:01:14.925
when resources should go
to the slums and to the poor


1015
01:01:15.093 --> 01:01:18.637
and to trying to revise
an extremely shabby country.


1016
01:01:19.014 --> 01:01:22.475
I tell you, the day Rome falls
there will be a shout of freedom


1017
01:01:22.642 --> 01:01:24.810
such as the world
has never heard before!


1018
01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.688
Gore Vidal disliked
the United States of America.


1019
01:01:27.939 --> 01:01:32.276
He always talked about the empire
in which he is now right.


1020
01:01:32.736 --> 01:01:34.528
Gore Vidal was correct
in prophesizing


1021
01:01:34.696 --> 01:01:36.155
that we would become an empire.

1022
01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.116
That is our present dilemma.

1023
01:01:51.129 --> 01:01:57.051
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!


1024
01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.803
This is the year
of "the whole world is watching."


1025
01:01:59.971 --> 01:02:02.806
This is the year where all politics
is suddenly televisual.


1026
01:02:02.974 --> 01:02:06.685
This is the year where the phrase
"living room war" comes.


1027
01:02:07.812 --> 01:02:10.773
It was as if a theater
piece was taking place


1028
01:02:10.941 --> 01:02:14.485
for the public watching television.

1029
01:02:23.662 --> 01:02:26.288
Please, help me!

1030
01:02:27.832 --> 01:02:31.627
If you do not leave,
you will be subject to arrest!


1031
01:02:57.362 --> 01:03:01.490
Gore asked me to drive him
to an event with a couple of friends.


1032
01:03:01.658 --> 01:03:06.745
So I had Gore Vidal, Arthur Miller
and Paul Newman in my car.


1033
01:03:07.747 --> 01:03:10.207
And we drove
into a cloud of tear gas.


1034
01:03:26.224 --> 01:03:28.017
Get away from the police.
Step up here.

They're pushing and shoving.

- Stop!


1037

The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

Who is first?
Mr. Vidal first.


1039
01:03:45.744 --> 01:03:49.121
Uh, it's like living
under a Soviet regime here.


1040
01:03:49.331 --> 01:03:53.667
The guards, the soldiers,
the agents provocateur,


1041
01:03:53.835 --> 01:03:56.629
and the parts of the police,
you've seen the roughing up.


1042
01:03:57.088 --> 01:04:00.549
There's very little that we can say
after those pictures...


1043
01:04:01.593 --> 01:04:03.260
that would be in any way adequate.

1044
01:04:03.428 --> 01:04:05.095
Let Mr. Buckley comment now.

1045
01:04:05.263 --> 01:04:08.474
The effort here,
not only on your program tonight,


1046
01:04:08.642 --> 01:04:11.518
but during the past two
or three days in Chicago


1047
01:04:11.686 --> 01:04:14.938
has been to institutionalize
this complaint.


1048
01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.985
So as to march forward and say we've
got sort of a Fascist situation,


1049
01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:25.115
but don't infer from individual
and despicable acts of violence


1050
01:04:25.283 --> 01:04:29.620
of Chicago policemen,
a case for implicit totalitarianism


1051
01:04:29.788 --> 01:04:31.246
in the American system.

1052
01:04:31.414 --> 01:04:33.540
If we can all
work up an equal sweat,

1053
01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:36.835
and if you all would be obliging
enough to have your cameras handy,


1054

every time a politician
commits demagogy,


1055
01:04:39.631 --> 01:04:44.176
or every time a labor union beats up
people who refuse to join his union,


1056
01:04:44.344 --> 01:04:47.680
then maybe we can work up some kind
of impartiality and resentment.


1057
01:04:47.889 --> 01:04:50.224
These people came here
with no desire other


1058
01:04:50.392 --> 01:04:51.725
than anybody's been able to prove,

1059
01:04:51.893 --> 01:04:54.186
- than hold peaceful demonstration.
- I can prove it.


1060
01:04:54.354 --> 01:04:57.815
I was 14 windows
above that gang last night.


1061
01:04:57.982 --> 01:05:01.735
And the chant between 11:00
and 5:00 this morning


1062
01:05:01.986 --> 01:05:03.612
from four or 5,000 voices

1063
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:06.198
was sheer utter obscenities

1064
01:05:06.366 --> 01:05:08.575
directed to the president
of the United States.


1065
01:05:08.743 --> 01:05:12.996
I think it is remarkable that there
was as much restraint shown


1066
01:05:13.164 --> 01:05:16.667
as was shown, for instance, last
night by cops who were out there


1067
01:05:16.835 --> 01:05:21.922
for 17 hours without inflicting a
single wound on a single person,


1068
01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:25.050
even though that kind of disgusting
stuff is being thrown at them


1069
01:05:25.218 --> 01:05:27.010
and at all of American society.

1070
01:05:27.178 --> 01:05:30.556
Mr. Vidal, wasn't it a provocative
act to try to raise


1071
01:05:30.724 --> 01:05:34.727
the Viet Kong flag in the park
in the film we just saw?


1072
01:05:34.894 --> 01:05:38.063
Wouldn't that invite...
Raising a Nazi flag in WWII


1073
01:05:38.231 --> 01:05:39.815
would've had similar consequences.

1074
01:05:39.983 --> 01:05:41.984
- Yes, and--
- People in the United States


1075
01:05:42.152 --> 01:05:46.196
happen to believe that the United
States' policy is wrong in Vietnam


1076
01:05:46.364 --> 01:05:49.450
and that Viet Kong are correct in
wanting to organize their country


1077
01:05:49.617 --> 01:05:51.285
in their own way politically.

1078
01:05:51.453 --> 01:05:54.204
If it is a novelty in Chicago
that is too bad,


1079
01:05:54.372 --> 01:05:56.498
but I assume that the point
of the American democracy


1080
01:05:56.666 --> 01:05:59.126
is you can express
any point of view that you want.


1081
01:05:59.294 --> 01:06:01.086
- Shut up a minute.
- No, I won't.


1082
01:06:01.254 --> 01:06:04.631
Some people were pro-Nazi and the
answer is that they were well treated


1083
01:06:04.841 --> 01:06:08.218
by people who ostracized them.
And I'm for ostracizing people


1084
01:06:08.386 --> 01:06:11.180
who egg on other people to shoot
American Marines


1085
01:06:11.347 --> 01:06:13.348
and American soldiers.
I know you don't care--


1086
01:06:13.516 --> 01:06:15.726
As far as I'm concerned,
the only sort of pro


1087
01:06:15.894 --> 01:06:18.228
or crypto-Nazi I can think of
is yourself.


1088
01:06:18.396 --> 01:06:21.398
- Failing that, I will only say--
- Let's not call names.


1089
01:06:21.566 --> 01:06:24.234
Now listen, you queer,
stop calling me a crypto-Nazi


1090
01:06:24.486 --> 01:06:28.322
or I'll sock you in the goddamn
face and you'll stay plastered.


1091
01:06:28.531 --> 01:06:29.907
- Gentlemen, let's--
- Bill.


1092
01:06:30.074 --> 01:06:33.118
Tell the author of Myra Breckinridge
to go back to his pornography


1093
01:06:33.286 --> 01:06:35.037
and stop making
any allusions of Nazism.


1094
01:06:35.205 --> 01:06:37.247
I was in the Infantry
in the last war.


1095
01:06:37.415 --> 01:06:40.501
You were not in the Infantry.
As a matter of fact, you were not.


1096
01:06:40.668 --> 01:06:42.836
You're distorting
your own military record.


1097
01:06:51.346 --> 01:06:53.263
The network nearly shat.

1098
01:06:53.765 --> 01:06:56.725
Now listen, you queer,
stop calling me a crypto-Nazi.


1099
01:06:56.893 --> 01:07:00.854
Or I'll sock you in the goddamn face
and you'll stay plastered.


1100
01:07:01.022 --> 01:07:02.606
- Gentlemen--
- I was watching it


1101
01:07:02.774 --> 01:07:05.901
with a number of the news executives
in the control room.


1102
01:07:06.402 --> 01:07:08.487
Someone said,
"Can they say that?!"


1103
01:07:08.863 --> 01:07:11.281
Well, you know, it's live.
They had.


1104
01:07:12.492 --> 01:07:14.785
I think Gore Vidal was fortunate

1105
01:07:14.953 --> 01:07:17.204
that Bill didn't
punch him in the nose.


1106
01:07:17.622 --> 01:07:20.290
Bill could've broken Gore Vidal
over the back of his knee.


1107
01:07:21.376 --> 01:07:23.502
When Gore Vidal called him
a crypto-Nazi,


1108
01:07:24.003 --> 01:07:25.546
Bill let him have it.

1109
01:07:26.047 --> 01:07:27.506
It is a slur.

1110
01:07:27.674 --> 01:07:31.218
And the rictus of loathing
on Mr. Buckley's face


1111
01:07:31.386 --> 01:07:32.761
is quite understated.

1112
01:07:33.096 --> 01:07:36.181
Buckley called Vidal
"queer" on television.


1113
01:07:37.183 --> 01:07:39.893
It's a slur. It would be
considered a hate slur today.


1114
01:07:42.814 --> 01:07:49.278
Profanity today is "nigger,"
"faggot" and "cunt."


1115
01:07:49.571 --> 01:07:52.823
Those are our only three
truly profane words.


1116
01:07:54.033 --> 01:07:57.661
In 1968, you could
call somebody a crypto-Nazi


1117
01:07:57.829 --> 01:08:01.248
or a queer,
and that was fighting words.


1118
01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.460
You have every right in this country
to take any position you want to take


1119
01:08:05.628 --> 01:08:07.504
because we are guaranteed
freedom of speech.


1120
01:08:07.672 --> 01:08:10.549
We just listened to a rather
grotesque example of it.


1121
01:08:10.717 --> 01:08:12.843
I think we've run out of time

1122
01:08:13.011 --> 01:08:16.805
and I thank you very much
for the discussion.


1123
01:08:16.973 --> 01:08:19.850
It was a little more heat
and a little less light than usual,


1124
01:08:20.018 --> 01:08:22.019
but it was still very worth hearing.

1125
01:08:23.438 --> 01:08:25.188
Tomorrow night, you'll have
a chance to...


1126
01:08:25.565 --> 01:08:27.900
My pulse was racing
and my fingers trembled


1127
01:08:28.067 --> 01:08:31.111
as wave after wave
of indignation swept over me.


1128
01:08:32.155 --> 01:08:33.655
And then, suddenly,

1129
01:08:33.823 --> 01:08:35.949
about to deposit the earphones
on the table stand,


1130
01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:38.410
I stopped, frozen.

1131
01:08:38.828 --> 01:08:42.164
Vidal, arranging his own set
was whispering to me.


1132
01:08:42.957 --> 01:08:45.083
"Well," he said, smiling,

1133
01:08:45.543 --> 01:08:48.253
"I guess we gave them
their money's worth tonight."


1134
01:08:50.173 --> 01:08:54.301
It was a splendid moment.
Eyes rolling, mouth twitching,


1135
01:08:54.469 --> 01:08:56.637
long, weak arms waving.

1136
01:08:57.347 --> 01:09:00.974
Buckley skittered from slander
to glorious absurdity.


1137
01:09:03.853 --> 01:09:06.980
I reached my trailer
after taking great strides


1138
01:09:07.148 --> 01:09:09.775
through the maze of technicians,
operators, executives,


1139
01:09:09.943 --> 01:09:11.735
reporters, guests.

1140
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:16.406
All of whom looked at me as I stomped
by, and then quickly looked away.


1141
01:09:17.617 --> 01:09:21.536
Afraid, perhaps, that I would greet
anyone guilty of a lingering glance


1142
01:09:21.704 --> 01:09:23.664
with a sock on his goddamn face.

1143
01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:28.043
The door slammed
and I heard shouting.


1144
01:09:28.211 --> 01:09:31.588
Paul Newman had been
in Vidal's trailer,


1145
01:09:31.923 --> 01:09:34.299
and had been watching it on
television, ran down the stairs,


1146
01:09:34.467 --> 01:09:38.553
ran into Buckley's trailer and
Buckley came in at the same time.


1147
01:09:38.805 --> 01:09:43.600
And Buckley, according to Newman,
responded that it was a disaster.


1148
01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:53.485
These ad hominem attacks
were not characteristic of Bill.


1149
01:09:54.779 --> 01:09:58.699
This was a totally unprecedented
thing for him to do on television.


1150
01:10:00.201 --> 01:10:02.869
Vidal was a smart enough
tactician to know


1151
01:10:03.037 --> 01:10:05.831
that he had won the debate
in that moment.


1152
01:10:11.963 --> 01:10:16.425
And that brings up the one final
question now the election is over.


1153
01:10:16.926 --> 01:10:21.054
Will Bill Buckley and Gore Vidal
kiss and make up?


1154
01:10:24.392 --> 01:10:26.601
I think Vidal would love that.

1155
01:10:50.543 --> 01:10:54.337
After we did it, no network
ever again did wall-to-wall,


1156
01:10:54.589 --> 01:10:55.881
gavel-to-gavel coverage.

1157
01:10:57.675 --> 01:10:59.634
It could be that some
executive said, "Hey,


1158
01:10:59.844 --> 01:11:03.680
whatever you may think of it, that
Vidal Buckley thing had a big impact.


1159
01:11:04.974 --> 01:11:07.184
Get Mr. Pro and Mr. Con,

1160
01:11:07.393 --> 01:11:10.395
Ms. For Abortion
and Ms. Against Abortion...


1161
01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.107
Jack, I spent the holidays flying
back and forth across this country


1162
01:11:14.275 --> 01:11:15.442
and I'm worried.

1163
01:11:15.777 --> 01:11:18.987
The place seems all out of focus,
sea to shining sea.


1164
01:11:19.739 --> 01:11:22.365
We've both flown many times, Shana,
coast to coast.


1165
01:11:22.533 --> 01:11:23.867
But we see a different land below.

1166
01:11:24.035 --> 01:11:26.745
And you have them argue
and that's punditry.


1167
01:11:27.121 --> 01:11:28.538
That's enlightenment.

1168
01:11:28.664 --> 01:11:31.333
Dan, there's an old saying:
"Behind every successful man


1169
01:11:31.542 --> 01:11:34.336
there's a woman,
a loving, giving, caring woman."


1170
01:11:36.631 --> 01:11:38.048
Jane, you ignorant slut.

1171
01:11:42.178 --> 01:11:44.971
Argument is sugar
and the rest of us are flies.


1172
01:11:48.142 --> 01:11:49.559
Welcome to Radio 81.

1173
01:11:49.852 --> 01:11:51.978
I think this is Ron
and Gore Vidal is also here.


1174
01:11:52.146 --> 01:11:54.689
I invariably agree
with your social views,


1175
01:11:55.066 --> 01:11:56.566
the content of your ideas.

1176
01:11:56.984 --> 01:11:59.361
And I contest with Buckley's views.

1177
01:11:59.821 --> 01:12:03.198
But I hear you talk,
and William Buckley talk,


1178
01:12:03.491 --> 01:12:06.618
I feel that Buckley
is the more honest man.


1179
01:12:07.161 --> 01:12:09.663
In what way do you find him
more honest than I?


1180
01:12:09.831 --> 01:12:13.041
I think it goes way back
to the debates


1181
01:12:13.209 --> 01:12:15.168
you had with him on television.

1182
01:12:15.461 --> 01:12:18.088
And you literally blew his mind.

1183
01:12:18.256 --> 01:12:20.298
I've never seen Buckley
lose it like that.


1184
01:12:20.466 --> 01:12:22.467
He swore at you
and stood up and said,


1185
01:12:22.635 --> 01:12:24.511
"How dare you call me a neo
-Nazi!"

1186
01:12:24.679 --> 01:12:27.097
I thought him the scum of the world,
you see.


1187
01:12:27.265 --> 01:12:28.890
- I know, he was over-excited, yeah?
- Yes.


1188
01:12:29.058 --> 01:12:30.851
- But I think--
- What did you find dishonest


1189
01:12:31.018 --> 01:12:32.602
about my performance?

1190
01:12:32.812 --> 01:12:35.647
It had to do with
the glee in your face,


1191
01:12:35.815 --> 01:12:37.607
in your eyes,
that you could not hide.


1192
01:12:37.775 --> 01:12:40.318
Well, that isn't...
I wasn't being dishonest.


1193
01:12:40.570 --> 01:12:42.737
I am a happy warrior.

1194
01:12:42.905 --> 01:12:44.573
I'm in battle, 
I'm enjoying it.

1195
01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:46.783
This is what these things are about.

1196
01:12:46.951 --> 01:12:49.161
If somebody that I regard
is a very bad person...


1197
01:12:50.079 --> 01:12:53.915
politically, then to expose him
on television for what he is


1198
01:12:54.083 --> 01:12:55.667
is my job.

1199
01:12:56.043 --> 01:12:58.670
And I think I accomplished it
very nicely, so did he.


1200
01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:01.089
He brought suit against me
as a result of it.


1201
01:13:02.967 --> 01:13:06.386
A year after these debates,
in August of 1969,


1202
01:13:06.846 --> 01:13:09.931
Esquire published a long essay
that Bill had written,


1203
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:12.559
something like 12,000 words

1204
01:13:13.227 --> 01:13:17.189
trying to explore why he had
reacted the way he did.


1205
01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:21.026
Buckley couldn't let it go.

1206
01:13:21.194 --> 01:13:23.111
He couldn't let this thing go.

1207
01:13:25.072 --> 01:13:28.241
He thought he would avenge himself
or explain himself


1208
01:13:28.409 --> 01:13:32.370
by writing in a sophisticated way
about Vidal in Esquire.


1209
01:13:35.583 --> 01:13:38.126
For days and weeks,
indeed for months,


1210
01:13:38.294 --> 01:13:41.004
I tormented myself
with the question...


1211
01:13:41.881 --> 01:13:43.965
"What should I have said?"

1212
01:13:44.759 --> 01:13:46.801
Was my mistake that of
going on TV at all,


1213
01:13:46.969 --> 01:13:49.012
in light of the abundant warnings,
with Vidal?


1214
01:13:50.556 --> 01:13:53.350
Could it be that my emotional
reaction was defensible


1215
01:13:53.517 --> 01:13:55.018
and even healthy,

1216
01:13:55.186 --> 01:13:57.938
but that my words were ill-chosen?

1217
01:13:58.314 --> 01:14:01.691
The problem was, instead of
putting a cap on the debate,


1218
01:14:01.859 --> 01:14:04.569
he's perpetuating it
on another platform,


1219
01:14:04.779 --> 01:14:06.112
which really made it worse.

1220
01:14:10.284 --> 01:14:12.494
Vidal then replied

1221
01:14:12.703 --> 01:14:18.208
in print to this barn burner piece
to take the stage back.


1222
01:14:21.754 --> 01:14:24.631
On Wednesday,
August 28, at 9:30,


1223
01:14:24.924 --> 01:14:27.634
in full view of ten million people,

1224
01:14:28.052 --> 01:14:31.763
the little door in William F. Buckley
Jr.'s forehead suddenly opened


1225
01:14:32.056 --> 01:14:36.101
and out sprang that wild cuckoo
which I had always known was there,


1226
01:14:36.269 --> 01:14:39.938
but had wanted so much for others,
preferably millions of others,


1227
01:14:40.106 --> 01:14:41.773
to get a good look at.

1228
01:14:43.067 --> 01:14:46.528
Vidal is always suspicious
of Buckley's sexuality.


1229
01:14:47.363 --> 01:14:51.283
And makes references
that suggest that


1230
01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:54.828
Buckley has an attraction
to the homoerotic.


1231
01:14:56.414 --> 01:14:58.581
There was always a question of...

1232
01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:00.250
Um...

1233
01:15:02.837 --> 01:15:04.212
I don't know how to put it.

1234
01:15:05.589 --> 01:15:09.175
That there was a kind of
sexual ambiguity about Bill.


1235
01:15:10.511 --> 01:15:12.470
There were rumors,
none of them substantiated.


1236
01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:14.931
It was more a manner of affect,
really.


1237
01:15:15.933 --> 01:15:18.268
Buckley was kind of an effete guy.

1238
01:15:18.853 --> 01:15:22.397
If you read the piece,
you are led to believe


1239
01:15:22.565 --> 01:15:27.694
that among other things, William F.
Buckley, Jr. was homosexual.


1240
01:15:31.991 --> 01:15:35.535
Buckley instituted a suit
against Esquire magazine


1241
01:15:35.703 --> 01:15:37.287
and against Vidal.

1242
01:15:38.039 --> 01:15:41.833
Vidal instituted a countersuit
against Buckley.


1243
01:15:42.335 --> 01:15:46.755
The litigation
went on for three years.


1244
01:15:46.922 --> 01:15:49.007
Is that still going back
and forth in the courts?


1245
01:15:49.467 --> 01:15:51.676
It's going more back than forth.

1246
01:15:51.844 --> 01:15:54.679
Just... it keeps on ticking away
like a bomb.


1247
01:15:55.473 --> 01:15:57.849
At the time, it was
one of the longest lawsuits


1248
01:15:58.017 --> 01:16:01.019
between two American public
intellectuals there'd ever been.


1249
01:16:01.187 --> 01:16:02.395
Neither of them ever tired of it.

1250
01:16:02.563 --> 01:16:05.940
It gave them enormous opportunity
for the practice of malice.


1251
01:16:06.525 --> 01:16:08.735
It's still litigious, is it?

1252
01:16:08.903 --> 01:16:10.278
Very litigious.

1253
01:16:12.198 --> 01:16:16.534
By the third year, Esquire
said, "We've had enough."


1254
01:16:18.412 --> 01:16:20.163
Esquire ended up settling.

1255
01:16:20.331 --> 01:16:23.166
And then Buckley,
in a stroke of brilliance,


1256
01:16:23.334 --> 01:16:25.752
gives a press conference
and declares victory.


1257
01:16:26.337 --> 01:16:29.506
In the public imagination,
people thought that he had won


1258
01:16:29.673 --> 01:16:32.550
this lawsuit they didn't
understand in the first place.


1259
01:16:32.843 --> 01:16:34.511
I know that Gore hated that.

1260
01:16:34.678 --> 01:16:37.806
Was it ever resolved, who came out
ahead on that whole thing?


1261
01:16:38.182 --> 01:16:40.809
Well, it sort of went on
for several years.


1262
01:16:40.976 --> 01:16:42.811
And then about a week
before we'd go into court,


1263
01:16:42.978 --> 01:16:44.479
he called off the suit.

1264
01:16:44.647 --> 01:16:46.898
- Pulled the suit out from under you?
- Exactly.


1265
01:16:47.066 --> 01:16:50.110
Exactly.
I was looking forward to that.


1266
01:16:59.787 --> 01:17:03.790
Why do you work so hard?
Why do you work so darn hard?


1267
01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:05.834
There's a lot to do.

1268
01:17:06.502 --> 01:17:09.421
Bill Buckley,
the popularizer, laid the foundation


1269
01:17:10.089 --> 01:17:11.673
for the conservative movement.

1270
01:17:11.841 --> 01:17:14.050
Which enabled Ronald Reagan
to come along


1271
01:17:14.218 --> 01:17:17.679
and to win that presidency
by the margin that he did.


1272
01:17:19.432 --> 01:17:22.308
I can't tell you exactly when
I discovered National Review.


1273
01:17:23.018 --> 01:17:25.186
It had a profound impact on me.

1274
01:17:28.732 --> 01:17:31.568
Well, my relationship
to Ronald Reagan was pretty close.


1275
01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:35.613
There was an affinity of ideas.

1276
01:17:38.033 --> 01:17:40.285
I visited him and he visited me.

1277
01:17:40.453 --> 01:17:42.954
We took a liking to each other.

1278
01:17:43.122 --> 01:17:44.539
Certainly I to him.

1279
01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:48.751
When Ronald Reagan
saluted William Buckley


1280
01:17:48.919 --> 01:17:51.004
and the National Review
as president,


1281
01:17:51.297 --> 01:17:52.672
Buckley became a king maker.

1282
01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.382
And he was seen
to be a king maker.

1283
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:58.720
And appearance is at least as
important as reality in this world.


1284
01:18:00.014 --> 01:18:02.182
When Buckley
and Reagan were ascended,


1285
01:18:02.349 --> 01:18:06.978
and Vidal's political ideology
was taking a backseat,


1286
01:18:07.146 --> 01:18:09.397
I think this was actually
a great period for him.


1287
01:18:09.607 --> 01:18:12.192
Some of his greatest writing
occurred in the '80s,


1288
01:18:12.359 --> 01:18:14.277
both in essays and in literature.

1289
01:18:15.279 --> 01:18:16.988
When another right-wing critic

1290
01:18:17.156 --> 01:18:19.699
attacked Gore Vidal
as being anti-American,


1291
01:18:20.826 --> 01:18:22.911
Gore's reply was,
"How can you call me anti-American?


1292
01:18:23.078 --> 01:18:24.871
I'm the country's official
biographer."


1293
01:18:32.254 --> 01:18:34.923
In Burr,
Vidal got off one of his great lines.


1294
01:18:35.508 --> 01:18:39.761
It was the beginning of Vidal's
attempt at revenge on Buckley.


1295
01:18:40.429 --> 01:18:44.516
I believe his name was
"William de la Touche Clancey".


1296
01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:46.935
And I think Vidal said somewhere

1297
01:18:47.102 --> 01:18:49.812
that it could not possibly
be based on anyone,


1298
01:18:50.064 --> 01:18:53.233
meaning that of course
it's based on Bill.


1299
01:18:54.276 --> 01:18:56.611
William de la Touche
Clancey's voice


1300
01:18:56.779 --> 01:18:59.113
is like that of a furious goose,

1301
01:18:59.281 --> 01:19:00.949
all honks and hisses.

1302
01:19:01.992 --> 01:19:03.952
He detests our democracy.

1303
01:19:04.119 --> 01:19:06.663
He fills the pages of his magazine,
America,


1304
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:09.749
with libelous comments
on all things American.


1305
01:19:09.917 --> 01:19:12.752
Despite a rich wife
and five children,


1306
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.921
he is a compulsive sodomite,

1307
01:19:15.089 --> 01:19:18.091
forever preying on country boys
new to the city.


1308
01:19:19.635 --> 01:19:21.177
It is extreme and...

1309
01:19:22.596 --> 01:19:24.889
He was a good hater, Vidal.

1310
01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:31.354
God knows what is at the very bottom
of that animosity.


1311
01:19:33.482 --> 01:19:35.316
He talked about it every day.

1312
01:19:35.943 --> 01:19:39.612
You don't talk about something
every day that didn't cut you.


1313
01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:42.323
And I don't think
that ever really healed.


1314
01:19:45.077 --> 01:19:48.788
We were in Ravello,
not much to do after dinner.


1315
01:19:49.373 --> 01:19:53.793
He had acquired a VHS copy
of the Vidal/Buckley debates.


1316
01:19:53.961 --> 01:19:56.838
I naively said,
"Do you think we could watch them?"


1317
01:19:57.006 --> 01:20:00.550
Little did I realize this was
the main event for the night.


1318
01:20:02.344 --> 01:20:04.971
We then watched them, I think,
again a couple nights later.


1319
01:20:05.139 --> 01:20:09.350
And on subsequent trips we watched
them two or three times.


1320
01:20:09.518 --> 01:20:12.145
And the thrill
of the first viewing was gone.


1321
01:20:12.313 --> 01:20:14.105
And you began to have the sensation

1322
01:20:14.273 --> 01:20:16.357
that you were edging
into Sunset Boulevard,


1323
01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:18.484
Norma Desmond territory.

1324
01:20:20.112 --> 01:20:22.238
It was Buckley
who was distressed by it.


1325
01:20:24.199 --> 01:20:28.911
Buckley let it become personal
in a way that he had been a maestro


1326
01:20:29.079 --> 01:20:30.330
of being able to avoid.

1327
01:20:30.497 --> 01:20:33.082
And that haunted him
for a very long time.


1328
01:20:36.253 --> 01:20:38.921
After 33 years on PBS,

1329
01:20:39.089 --> 01:20:43.384
William F. Buckley, Jr. taped his
last program before an audience


1330
01:20:43.552 --> 01:20:44.761
of invited guests.

1331
01:20:45.304 --> 01:20:47.805
The last show was succeeded

1332
01:20:47.973 --> 01:20:50.099
by an interview with Ted Koppel.

1333
01:20:50.267 --> 01:20:52.894
And at one point,
he showed


1334
01:20:53.062 --> 01:20:56.481
the now already infamous clip.

1335
01:20:56.649 --> 01:20:59.692
Now listen, you queer,
stop calling me a crypto-Nazi,


1336
01:20:59.985 --> 01:21:04.030
or I'll sock you in the goddamn face
and you'll stay plastered.


1337
01:21:05.658 --> 01:21:08.993
Buckley, uncharacteristically,
said nothing


1338
01:21:09.161 --> 01:21:11.412
and then they went
to the commercial break.


1339
01:21:12.081 --> 01:21:13.790
I was in the audience that day.

1340
01:21:14.208 --> 01:21:19.754
And he made a beeline up the aisle
to where I was sitting and said,


1341
01:21:19.922 --> 01:21:23.216
"I thought that tape
had been destroyed."


1342
01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:28.388
More than 30 years
after the original debates,


1343
01:21:28.555 --> 01:21:31.599
he was still furious with Vidal,

1344
01:21:31.767 --> 01:21:34.519
and still shaken
that he had reacted that way.


1345
01:21:35.479 --> 01:21:38.022
- Do you wish you were 20?
- No!


1346
01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:40.316
Absolutely not.

1347
01:21:41.318 --> 01:21:43.027
No, I would...

1348
01:21:43.195 --> 01:21:46.239
If I had a pill which would
reduce my age by 25 years,


1349
01:21:46.407 --> 01:21:48.157
- I wouldn't take it.
- Why not?


1350
01:21:48.325 --> 01:21:50.910
Because I'm tired of life.

1351
01:21:51.078 --> 01:21:52.829
- Are you really?
- Yeah.


1352
01:21:54.123 --> 01:21:55.123
I really am.

1353
01:21:55.290 --> 01:21:58.918
I'm utterly prepared to stop...

1354
01:21:59.753 --> 01:22:00.878
living on.

1355
01:22:02.089 --> 01:22:05.967
Any regrets about this life
that you have lived?


1356
01:22:08.011 --> 01:22:09.595
- Yeah...
- Like what?


1357
01:22:09.763 --> 01:22:11.681
Well, I'm not sure I'd tell you.

1358
01:22:13.851 --> 01:22:17.311
Someone asked when
Bill Buckley died what Gore thought.


1359
01:22:18.731 --> 01:22:23.276
He said, "I thought that hell
will be a livelier place,


1360
01:22:24.903 --> 01:22:29.073
that he will be permanently
among those he served in life,


1361
01:22:30.617 --> 01:22:34.120
applauding their prejudices
and fanning their hatreds."


1362
01:22:35.956 --> 01:22:37.832
The last line of that piece was:

1363
01:22:38.333 --> 01:22:41.210
"WFB, rest in hell."

1364
01:22:42.755 --> 01:22:44.422
It seems a little farfetched to say

1365
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:47.508
that Gore Vidal was waiting around
for Buckley to die


1366
01:22:47.676 --> 01:22:49.010
so he could have the last word.

1367
01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:52.847
But I promise you
that he took great pleasure in that.


1368
01:22:54.016 --> 01:22:56.976
He was not satisfied if he didn't
have something to fight against.


1369
01:22:57.144 --> 01:22:58.853
And at the end of his life,
I think he was fighting


1370
01:22:59.021 --> 01:23:01.773
against the ghosts
of all these enemies.


1371
01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:04.942
Truman Capote once famously said,

1372
01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:09.030
that it wasn't a matter of when
Gore Vidal would be forgotten,


1373
01:23:09.198 --> 01:23:11.991
it was more or less
when did he start to be forgotten?


1374
01:23:13.327 --> 01:23:15.787
Gore was convinced this had
happened already.


1375
01:23:16.914 --> 01:23:20.374
The young had forgotten him.
His books weren't being read anymore.


1376
01:23:24.713 --> 01:23:27.924
These figures
become most interesting


1377
01:23:28.091 --> 01:23:30.510
when they're not listened to
so much.


1378
01:23:30.719 --> 01:23:34.055
Because then there's a kind of
big silence inside themselves.


1379
01:23:38.143 --> 01:23:41.979
I compared it in an essay I wrote
to Wallace Stevens' great poem,


1380
01:23:42.481 --> 01:23:45.733
The Snowman, where he says,

1381
01:23:45.901 --> 01:23:47.777
"You have to have
a mind of winter


1382
01:23:47.945 --> 01:23:51.030
to see nothing that is not there

1383
01:23:51.198 --> 01:23:53.157
and the nothing that is."

1384
01:24:05.295 --> 01:24:08.172
I think these great debates
are absolutely nonsense.


1385
01:24:09.341 --> 01:24:12.176
The way they're set up, there's
almost no interchange of ideas,


1386
01:24:12.344 --> 01:24:14.178
very little even of personality.

1387
01:24:14.763 --> 01:24:17.056
There's also a terrible thing
about this medium


1388
01:24:17.224 --> 01:24:18.850
that hardly anyone listens.

1389
01:24:19.434 --> 01:24:21.519
They sort of get an impression
of somebody


1390
01:24:21.687 --> 01:24:23.729
and they think they've figured out
just what he's like


1391
01:24:23.897 --> 01:24:25.606
by seeing him on television.

1392
01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:30.695
The Buckley-Vidal debate
was a harbinger


1393
01:24:30.863 --> 01:24:32.280
of an unhappy future.

1394
01:24:34.992 --> 01:24:37.493
Does television run America?

1395
01:24:37.953 --> 01:24:42.039
There is an implicit
conflict of interest


1396
01:24:42.207 --> 01:24:44.792
between that which is
highly viewable


1397
01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:48.045
and that which is
highly illuminating.


1398
01:24:53.969 --> 01:24:58.681
That was a time when
television was still a public square.


1399
01:24:58.849 --> 01:25:03.352
Where Americans gathered and saw
pretty much the same thing.


1400
01:25:04.104 --> 01:25:05.438
There's nothing like that now.

1401
01:25:17.534 --> 01:25:20.411
That's terrifying!

1402
01:25:21.872 --> 01:25:23.873
Well, it's because, see,
we're a debate show.


1403
01:25:24.041 --> 01:25:25.499
- It's like saying--
- No, that'd be great,


1404
01:25:25.667 --> 01:25:28.044
I would love to see a debate show.

1405
01:25:28.211 --> 01:25:30.338
...a 24-hour day where we have
each side on as best we can--


1406
01:25:30.631 --> 01:25:33.257
No. That would be great.
You're doing theater


1407
01:25:33.508 --> 01:25:35.426
when you should be doing debate.

1408
01:25:40.307 --> 01:25:43.476
The ability to talk
the same language is gone.


1409
01:25:43.936 --> 01:25:49.106
More and more, we're divided
into communities of concern.


1410
01:25:49.733 --> 01:25:53.402
Each side can ignore the other side
and live in its own world.


1411
01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:55.154
It makes us less of a nation.

1412
01:25:55.322 --> 01:25:59.617
Because, what binds us together
is the pictures in our heads.


1413
01:25:59.993 --> 01:26:03.996
But if those people
are not sharing those ideas...


1414
01:26:04.831 --> 01:26:06.666
they're not living
in the same place.


1415
01:27:47.142 --> 01:27:49.143
You've got a few more seconds.
Are you capable


1416
01:27:49.311 --> 01:27:51.645
- of summing up in ten seconds?
- No.


1417
01:27:52.311 --> 01:27:53.645
