1
00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:09.142
Mind if I smoke

2
00:00:10.251 --> 00:00:11.009
while you're eating?

3
00:00:18.327 --> 00:00:19.249
Kissing with their tongue.

4
00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:20.778
And that's first class?

5
00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:21.264
Correct.

6
00:00:21.624 --> 00:00:23.037
Which part of first class?

7
00:00:23.062 --> 00:00:24.413
Sex or nonsex?

8
00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:26.895
It'll be like I never

9
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.920
even existed.

10
00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:40.318
I'm Luke Skywalker.

11
00:00:40.343 --> 00:00:41.514
I'm here to save you.

12
00:00:41.577 --> 00:00:43.630
I'm being rescued
by a transvestite?


13
00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:45.710
My god, he's a pervert, too.

14
00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:55.390
What we did was terribly wrong.

15
00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:57.788
Is this sexual harassment?

16
00:00:58.241 --> 00:00:58.780
Yeah...

17
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:01.765
Do you think you're liberated?

18
00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:09.377
You're a fucking asshole!

19
00:01:09.377 --> 00:01:11.116
I despise you!

20
00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:12.250
Fuck that shit. Run!

21
00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.978
And thank you
for flying star tours.


22
00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:42.178
Movies have been
making us laugh and cry,


23
00:01:42.366 --> 00:01:45.077
gasp and scream
for over 100 years.


24
00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:47.146
And since the earliest
days of cinema,


25
00:01:47.171 --> 00:01:49.983
adult films have been a part
of the motion picture landscape.


26
00:01:50.265 --> 00:01:53.155
Making us gasp for
entirely different reasons.


27
00:01:53.444 --> 00:01:55.413
As far back as the 1880's,

28
00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:58.858
filmmakers saw the goldmine
potential of erotic films...


29
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.413
loops, stag films,
peep show booths.


30
00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:04.668
For the next 90 years,

31
00:02:04.668 --> 00:02:07.390
society watched sex
in a variety of ways.


32
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.436
Then in the 1970's,
everything changed.


33
00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:13.505
Taking advantage of a more
socially permissive atmosphere,


34
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.835
directors began telling stories
surrounding the hardcore sex.


35
00:02:17.405 --> 00:02:20.146
For the first time ever,
full-length movies with


36
00:02:20.171 --> 00:02:23.007
explicit sex were being shown
in theaters for a mass audience.


37
00:02:23.211 --> 00:02:27.429
It's impossible to overstate the
importance of Gerard Damiano's film,


38
00:02:27.454 --> 00:02:28.336
"Deep Throat."

39
00:02:28.593 --> 00:02:32.281
This movie opened the door for virtually
every adult feature that came after.


40
00:02:32.773 --> 00:02:35.756
While the exaggerated
close-ups, campy performances,


41
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:38.052
and fireworks going
off during orgasms


42
00:02:38.077 --> 00:02:40.568
might seem a little comical
to a modern audience,


43
00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:44.866
in 1972, audiences had
never seen anything like it.


44
00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:47.076
Whether discussing
adult or mainstream,


45
00:02:47.101 --> 00:02:50.514
"Deep Throat" remains one of
the most profitable films of all time.


46
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.052
You say that you want more out
of sex than just a lot of little tingles?


47
00:02:54.077 --> 00:02:56.662
Yes, I wanna hear
bells and bombs...


48
00:02:56.687 --> 00:02:59.624
Yes, we just went through that, Miss
Lovelace. Let's not do that part again.


49
00:02:59.953 --> 00:03:03.724
I don't think people under a
certain age understand just


50
00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:10.601
how edgy and how radical it was to
put actual sex in a big movie theater.


51
00:03:10.773 --> 00:03:13.568
"Deep Throat," in
particular, open a lot of doors.


52
00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:17.272
It made it... seeing something
like that more accessible,


53
00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:21.147
and then that helps in
making it seem more normal.


54
00:03:21.523 --> 00:03:24.053
"Deep Throat" and...
"The Devil in Miss Jones"


55
00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.583
played as a double
bill for like 10 years.


56
00:03:25.608 --> 00:03:27.938
When "Deep Throat" came
out in New York theaters,


57
00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.553
lines around the block...
Jackie O on the line.


58
00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:35.622
Jackie Kennedy went to
see... I mean Jackie Kennedy?!


59
00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:38.803
Deep Throat is this girl
named Linda Lovelace.


60
00:03:38.828 --> 00:03:42.256
who... she's... she's
tired of... of sex.


61
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:45.733
She thinks that it should be
more than just little tingles.


62
00:03:46.186 --> 00:03:49.997
It makes me feel sort of
tingly all over, and then...


63
00:03:50.022 --> 00:03:50.647
And then what?

64
00:03:51.178 --> 00:03:51.881
Nothing.

65
00:03:52.381 --> 00:03:55.411
I mean there should be more
to sex than a lot of little tingles.


66
00:03:55.436 --> 00:04:00.215
There should be bells ringing, seams
bursting, bombs going off... something.


67
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.450
Do you wanna get off, or
do you wanna wreck a city?


68
00:04:02.475 --> 00:04:05.514
She can't understand why
she can't have an orgasm,


69
00:04:05.796 --> 00:04:09.865
because she has all this sex, and nothing...
I mean it's nice, but nothing happens.


70
00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:13.662
So, um, she goes to
see a sex therapist,


71
00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:15.686
Mr. Harry Reims,

72
00:04:16.014 --> 00:04:20.546
who, um, examines her
and discovers that her clitoris


73
00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:23.514
is actually all the way
in the back of her throat.


74
00:04:23.671 --> 00:04:26.739
Well, there it is. You
little bugger! There it is!


75
00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:27.569
What?

76
00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:31.053
Well, your clitoris, it's deep
down in the bottom of your throat.


77
00:04:32.627 --> 00:04:34.389
Now, now, Miss Lovelace,

78
00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:37.802
listen, having a clitoris deep
down in the bottom of your throat


79
00:04:37.827 --> 00:04:40.029
is better than having
no clitoris at all.


80
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.655
There's a theme song...

81
00:04:44.058 --> 00:04:44.787
I forgot.

82
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.897
Um, there's a theme
song when she discovers


83
00:04:48.225 --> 00:04:50.443
this... this, uh, skill.

84
00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.756
♪ Deep Throat ♪

85
00:04:54.116 --> 00:04:59.241
♪ deeper than deep your throat ♪

86
00:04:59.717 --> 00:05:01.731
♪ Deep Throat ♪

87
00:05:01.756 --> 00:05:03.943
♪ row row your boat ♪

88
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.716
She finally has an orgasm.

89
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:11.146
There's a montage of
fireworks and bells ringing


90
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:15.942
and a rocket ship going up while
it's flashing between her face coming


91
00:05:15.967 --> 00:05:18.661
and... so funny.

92
00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:23.201
So he hires her as a nurse,
and she goes out on call


93
00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:25.514
and fucks all these guys.

94
00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:28.460
Tell me, Mr. Moore,
how do you feel now?


95
00:05:28.913 --> 00:05:34.514
And, eventually, she finds
the perfect penis for her throat.


96
00:05:34.897 --> 00:05:37.553
And they have another montage.

97
00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:43.029
In most '70s porno,
everyone has a lot of hair,


98
00:05:43.326 --> 00:05:48.309
but in "Deep Throat," Linda
is completely clean-shaven.


99
00:05:48.334 --> 00:05:52.771
I wondered if maybe she
started that trend perhaps?


100
00:05:53.002 --> 00:05:54.793
Or made it popular at least?

101
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:59.201
I don't know, because so many
people saw it, so makes sense.


102
00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:05.238
Nixon, along with Keating, and
that administration was out to stop the


103
00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:09.127
negative press of
Watergate and, uh, Vietnam.


104
00:06:09.221 --> 00:06:14.251
I think revisiting this story and
revisiting, you know, the tactics that


105
00:06:14.463 --> 00:06:17.642
came into play when the
government decided that, uh,


106
00:06:17.907 --> 00:06:21.156
they had a problem
morally with subject matter,


107
00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:24.744
as in "Deep Throat,"
the film, um, is important.


108
00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:27.643
And the easiest target
was the adult film industry.


109
00:06:28.244 --> 00:06:31.447
Nixon rigged the courtroom
and rigged the judge


110
00:06:31.673 --> 00:06:37.212
and got his, uh, convictions against
the cast members of "Deep Throat."


111
00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:41.758
I definitely think she's...
she's better at, um,


112
00:06:41.783 --> 00:06:44.110
deep-throating
thicker cocks than I am,


113
00:06:44.135 --> 00:06:47.002
but I definitely drool a
lot more than she does.


114
00:06:50.127 --> 00:06:51.298
Ladies and gentlemen,

115
00:06:51.885 --> 00:06:56.611
you are about to witness the ravishment
of a woman who has been abducted.


116
00:06:57.182 --> 00:06:59.766
I answered an ad in the
"San Francisco Chronicle"


117
00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:02.790
that said "Now casting
for a major motion picture."


118
00:07:02.815 --> 00:07:04.978
So I walked up the stairs,
and I sat in their office,


119
00:07:05.003 --> 00:07:08.931
and here's these two brothers
who are absolutely charming,


120
00:07:08.956 --> 00:07:12.461
fabulous people, family men,

121
00:07:12.486 --> 00:07:17.087
not the least bit of a question in my
mind that they were totally honest guys.


122
00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:22.625
They explained to me the
story of "Behind the Green Door,"


123
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.953
which I thought was very cool,

124
00:07:23.978 --> 00:07:26.477
because that was the time
of drugs, sex, and rock-n-roll.


125
00:07:26.502 --> 00:07:27.930
It was just, you
know, anything went.


126
00:07:27.955 --> 00:07:30.298
Before I left, I said, "If you do
want me to do this, by the way,


127
00:07:30.323 --> 00:07:33.547
I want this amount of money and this
percentage of whatever for so many years."


128
00:07:33.579 --> 00:07:36.392
And they said, you know,
"Don't call us, we'll call you."


129
00:07:36.767 --> 00:07:38.726
So about an hour later,
I'm sitting at my house,


130
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:40.361
and they called and
said, "We wanna do it."


131
00:07:40.556 --> 00:07:42.437
So they came over for
me to sign the contract,


132
00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.173
and that was, uh, that
was the end of that.


133
00:07:46.454 --> 00:07:51.618
Although, at first, her reactions may lead
you to believe that she is being tortured,


134
00:07:52.165 --> 00:07:57.494
quite the contrary is true, for no
harm will come to those being ravished.


135
00:07:58.832 --> 00:08:01.176
In the morning,
she will be set free,


136
00:08:01.653 --> 00:08:06.591
unaware of anything except that
she has been loved as never before.


137
00:08:06.837 --> 00:08:08.835
The whole thing about the
movie was... and I said to them,


138
00:08:08.835 --> 00:08:11.119
"I'm an actress, and
I say not one word."


139
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.024
He said, "Oh, no, that's
even more difficult," which it is.


140
00:08:15.049 --> 00:08:16.149
Because you really have
to convey your feelings,


141
00:08:16.173 --> 00:08:19.485
whatever they may be, through
your eyes and your actions.


142
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.736
And I said, "I don't really wanna
know what's gonna happen.


143
00:08:22.307 --> 00:08:25.430
I know it's gonna be wild and
sexy, and it's gonna be scary,


144
00:08:25.455 --> 00:08:27.055
probably, for me
at certain times,


145
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:28.471
but I don't want to know."

146
00:08:32.668 --> 00:08:38.002
Johnnie Keyes, he was the black guy with
the shark teeth around his neck and, um,


147
00:08:38.027 --> 00:08:41.252
very ethnic looking. And
when we started to have sex,


148
00:08:41.252 --> 00:08:42.855
it was the kind of thing where

149
00:08:43.527 --> 00:08:46.260
I was, like, totally freaked out, I didn't
think I was gonna be able to do this one.


150
00:08:46.285 --> 00:08:49.325
I fucked her for a long time. I fucked
her for 43 minutes without stopping.


151
00:08:49.349 --> 00:08:51.989
Nobody does that. That
was a marathon fuck.


152
00:08:52.014 --> 00:08:55.520
Then it... there was a moment
where it turned from terror


153
00:08:55.942 --> 00:08:58.340
to pleasure, and I really
believe you can see that.


154
00:08:58.365 --> 00:09:01.340
And I know that there was a
time that I felt myself slip on


155
00:09:01.365 --> 00:09:03.121
to the other side, if
you know what I mean.


156
00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:07.184
Uh, Marilyn, she passed out,
she fainted. And I... in my mind,


157
00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:10.161
I said, "Shit, I'm going to jail. I done
killed this white woman with my dick."


158
00:09:10.498 --> 00:09:12.254
Well, the trapezes
were a bit much.


159
00:09:12.279 --> 00:09:14.170
It's a good thing I was in
pretty good shape, because


160
00:09:14.397 --> 00:09:18.553
there was a lot of standing
around, literally, on top of people,


161
00:09:18.578 --> 00:09:22.584
and there was trapezes and whatnot.
You had to be a gymnast, definitely.


162
00:09:22.764 --> 00:09:23.998
The way that the story of...

163
00:09:24.023 --> 00:09:27.028
when "Behind the Green Door"
and "Ivory Soap Box" came out,


164
00:09:27.053 --> 00:09:29.073
I told the Mitchell brothers
that, "Oh, by the way,


165
00:09:29.098 --> 00:09:32.627
I did this commercial for Procter
& Gamble, uh, Ivory Soap Box."


166
00:09:32.652 --> 00:09:34.222
And they're saying, "What?"

167
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.969
We walked down the soap
aisles, we look, and there is my mug


168
00:09:37.994 --> 00:09:40.704
on all these boxes,
staring down at us,


169
00:09:40.729 --> 00:09:41.896
and it just happened to be

170
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.227
the very same week that "Behind the
Green Door" opened in the theaters.


171
00:09:44.252 --> 00:09:46.758
I'm not gonna say that
I created porno chic,


172
00:09:46.783 --> 00:09:48.205
but I know that
I was part of it.


173
00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:50.992
And that was a very
important time in our history


174
00:09:51.017 --> 00:09:53.767
where people like Johnny Carson
were waiting in line to see "Deep Throat."


175
00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:58.007
It was couples, and it was all different
people from different walks of life


176
00:09:58.032 --> 00:10:00.751
going to see adult films
and getting turned on to them.


177
00:10:00.883 --> 00:10:03.157
You're telling me that I'm dead,

178
00:10:04.071 --> 00:10:08.669
and you're trying to decide whether to
send me up to heaven or... down to hell.


179
00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:15.277
I really honestly
thought nobody I knew...


180
00:10:15.302 --> 00:10:18.208
much less anybody
I was related to...


181
00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:19.974
would ever know about it.

182
00:10:20.661 --> 00:10:24.653
I certainly did not expect it
to become a household word.


183
00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:29.004
"The Devil in Miss Jones"
was definitely an art movie,


184
00:10:29.029 --> 00:10:31.105
with an ambiguous storyline

185
00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:36.498
and I'm still not really 100%
sure exactly what the story was.


186
00:10:36.974 --> 00:10:38.162
But I still think it worked.

187
00:10:38.895 --> 00:10:39.919
Can you help me?

188
00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:45.154
I... I seemed to
have lost my way.


189
00:10:46.099 --> 00:10:48.461
I'll help you all I can,
but you're not lost.


190
00:10:49.326 --> 00:10:50.481
Then where am I?

191
00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:51.279
You're here.

192
00:10:52.247 --> 00:10:57.302
Jerry Damiano was the
sweetest guy I ever met.


193
00:10:57.388 --> 00:10:59.855
He looked back over at me,
and he says, "Can you cook?"


194
00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:00.566
I said, "Yeah."

195
00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:03.316
He said, "Okay, you
wanna cook on the film?"


196
00:11:03.341 --> 00:11:04.005
I said, "Sure."

197
00:11:04.232 --> 00:11:07.419
He said, "I got somebody coming
in to read the part of the devil


198
00:11:07.444 --> 00:11:10.974
in this film I'm doing. Would
you mind reading with him?"


199
00:11:11.404 --> 00:11:14.083
And I said, "Sure,
I'd be glad to."


200
00:11:14.872 --> 00:11:16.896
I've done everything
that I've been taught.


201
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.575
Doesn't that count for anything?

202
00:11:20.223 --> 00:11:23.497
And he looks over at me, he said,
"Would you like to play miss Jones?"


203
00:11:24.646 --> 00:11:26.888
And I said, "And cook?"

204
00:11:28.169 --> 00:11:29.841
How about lust?

205
00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:31.332
Lust?

206
00:11:31.357 --> 00:11:32.341
Yes, lust.

207
00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:35.255
It is one of the seven
deadly sins, isn't it?


208
00:11:35.474 --> 00:11:38.052
He offered me $100 a
day to do miss Jones.


209
00:11:38.077 --> 00:11:39.537
And I said, "That sounds good."

210
00:11:39.882 --> 00:11:43.389
So I was making $125 a
day, instead of just $100.


211
00:11:43.483 --> 00:11:45.536
Georgina was amazing.

212
00:11:45.561 --> 00:11:48.459
Her acting was fantastic, and

213
00:11:49.194 --> 00:11:54.193
the way that she fucked
was so passionate.


214
00:11:54.218 --> 00:11:58.269
Like, she... she brought energy to all of
the scenes, and it really, really showed.


215
00:11:58.319 --> 00:12:00.861
For that day, it was
a big budget film.


216
00:12:00.947 --> 00:12:03.845
I think they were spending
something like $25,000.


217
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.272
It didn't put my kids through
college, but it certainly


218
00:12:06.296 --> 00:12:09.861
did open up an interesting
can of worms for my life.


219
00:12:10.002 --> 00:12:16.617
That suicide scene... every
actor and actress in the world,


220
00:12:16.642 --> 00:12:21.085
from the beginning of time,
wants to play a death scene.


221
00:12:21.377 --> 00:12:24.710
A suicide at the beginning of a
porn movie really sets the tone.


222
00:12:24.922 --> 00:12:27.900
And I think it's also very brave

223
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.556
to start a movie that's supposed
to be about sex with death.


224
00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:40.043
Ah, Herman, Herman, that
beautiful, sweet, affectionate boa,


225
00:12:41.015 --> 00:12:44.679
who could turn and look as fierce
as you wanted him to. What an actor.


226
00:12:44.788 --> 00:12:47.211
It wasn't planned for
him to be in the film.


227
00:12:47.577 --> 00:12:49.770
And I'm talking to
the snake on the bed,


228
00:12:49.795 --> 00:12:53.444
and Jerry walks by and
skids to a halt and said,


229
00:12:53.827 --> 00:12:57.405
"You're a snake wrangler." He
said, "Would you do a scene with it?"


230
00:12:57.608 --> 00:13:00.373
Marks says, "$100
a day, same as I get."


231
00:13:00.631 --> 00:13:02.529
So Herman was in the film.

232
00:13:02.554 --> 00:13:05.505
The anal scene, which everyone,
of course, always asks about...


233
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:09.929
I don't know... it's... it's a huge fantasy in
everyone's mind, I think, to... to give it a try.


234
00:13:10.007 --> 00:13:14.668
And when it gets all big
and fat and hard and slippery,


235
00:13:14.692 --> 00:13:18.236
and you could
stick it in my ass.


236
00:13:18.369 --> 00:13:21.968
Getting fucked in the ass is just a
couple of moments of... you get used to it.


237
00:13:23.158 --> 00:13:27.492
One of my favorite things about the
sex scenes was Georgina's dirty talk.


238
00:13:27.517 --> 00:13:29.502
Can you feel his
prick? Can he feel you?


239
00:13:30.165 --> 00:13:31.509
Can you feel him?

240
00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:33.835
Can you feel your
cocks together?


241
00:13:34.072 --> 00:13:36.236
Can you, rubbing against my...

242
00:13:36.353 --> 00:13:41.169
It so added to the sex scene.

243
00:13:41.169 --> 00:13:44.960
The dirty... the dirty talk was one of
the hottest things of the movie for me.


244
00:13:45.603 --> 00:13:49.306
When Jerry called me about
a year after we did the film


245
00:13:49.835 --> 00:13:53.806
and said, "I want you to go to
Toronto for this grand opening..."


246
00:13:54.454 --> 00:14:00.640
it was lavish, it was elegant, it
was covered by a million cameras


247
00:14:00.665 --> 00:14:06.282
all over the room, and
splashed all over the place. And...


248
00:14:08.024 --> 00:14:11.339
I said, "Well, so much
for anim... anonymity now.


249
00:14:11.364 --> 00:14:15.136
I guess I... I guess I'll have to tell my
parents what I've been doing for a living."


250
00:14:15.161 --> 00:14:15.730
what's your name?

251
00:14:15.926 --> 00:14:17.090
Misty Beethoven.

252
00:14:17.252 --> 00:14:18.169
Is that your real name?

253
00:14:18.535 --> 00:14:21.152
No, it's not. I thought it
would sound more important.


254
00:14:21.682 --> 00:14:22.599
What was it before?

255
00:14:22.856 --> 00:14:24.105
Delores Beethoven

256
00:14:24.909 --> 00:14:28.875
I was cast in "Misty Beethoven"
by "Henry Paris" Radley Metzger


257
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:32.109
and I flew to New York, and
I met him, and he talked to


258
00:14:32.134 --> 00:14:35.164
me and everything and told
me to go back home and to get


259
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:39.166
every bit of clothing, every
photograph that had ever


260
00:14:39.191 --> 00:14:42.759
been taken of me in my entire
life, and bring it all back to New York.


261
00:14:43.072 --> 00:14:45.220
As Hyman Mandel once said,

262
00:14:47.877 --> 00:14:53.666
"Never let the fact that they are doing
it wrong stop you from doing it right."


263
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.109
Who was Hyman Mandel?

264
00:14:55.673 --> 00:14:56.611
I don't know.

265
00:14:57.194 --> 00:15:00.381
I read that on the men's room
wall at the New York athletic club.


266
00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.519
It's a take on George
Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion" or


267
00:15:03.543 --> 00:15:05.793
modern-day "My Fair
Lady" or even "She's


268
00:15:05.793 --> 00:15:09.748
All That," if you're in the
really modern generations


269
00:15:09.773 --> 00:15:13.220
but it's taking this woman, who is,
like, a dime-store hooker, basically,


270
00:15:13.244 --> 00:15:15.211
giving hand jobs
in movie theaters.


271
00:15:15.236 --> 00:15:17.514
Excuse me, my gum
was in front of you.


272
00:15:17.539 --> 00:15:18.522
How'd you know that was yours?

273
00:15:18.547 --> 00:15:20.812
Five seats in. Five's my
lucky number. You American?


274
00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:21.741
Most of the time.

275
00:15:21.766 --> 00:15:23.140
Five bucks for a hand job.

276
00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:25.117
I'll meet you outside
in ten minutes.


277
00:15:25.142 --> 00:15:26.016
Ten minutes?

278
00:15:26.169 --> 00:15:28.396
Mm-hmm. Ten minutes.
I have to meet Napoleon.


279
00:15:28.421 --> 00:15:29.226
Napoleon?

280
00:15:29.828 --> 00:15:30.742
Napoleon.

281
00:15:31.695 --> 00:15:33.222
Hi. You're right on time.

282
00:15:34.055 --> 00:15:37.345
Jamie Gillis was a sexologist,
and he was going to train me


283
00:15:37.626 --> 00:15:39.290
to become the " Goldenrod Girl".

284
00:15:39.315 --> 00:15:41.594
He takes her on as a project

285
00:15:41.619 --> 00:15:46.072
where he feels he can
turn this lowly street girl


286
00:15:46.338 --> 00:15:49.813
into a courtesan
of world renown.


287
00:15:49.845 --> 00:15:52.572
My dear, you are the
absolute nadir of passion,


288
00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:55.708
the most unexciting
thing god has ever created,


289
00:15:55.826 --> 00:15:57.607
a sexual civil service worker.

290
00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.887
Nobody needs to
read my last book more


291
00:16:00.912 --> 00:16:03.122
or deserves to be in my
next book less than you.


292
00:16:03.287 --> 00:16:07.160
It's fascinating, because you're watching
this very insecure Constance Money


293
00:16:07.185 --> 00:16:12.576
go from this very unattractive wig
and makeup to the end, where she's


294
00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:16.458
basically taking one of the
most prestigious men in town


295
00:16:16.654 --> 00:16:19.707
and putting a strap on
and fucking him with it.


296
00:16:19.732 --> 00:16:22.512
I went up to see a fellow by
the name of Radley Metzger,


297
00:16:22.537 --> 00:16:26.191
who, uh, his nom de
porn became Henry Paris.


298
00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.160
And, um, uh, instead
of being, uh, on the film,


299
00:16:31.185 --> 00:16:34.710
he's a bit of a Svengali, and
I wound up being in the film.


300
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.829
You don't think I'm gonna let him
make that perilous journey alone?


301
00:16:39.717 --> 00:16:43.302
It was quite an experience,
because I was unfamiliar with what


302
00:16:43.514 --> 00:16:46.491
behavior and protocol
was supposed to be like,


303
00:16:46.671 --> 00:16:51.342
uh, on an adult set, so it was
really breaking into something


304
00:16:51.367 --> 00:16:52.640
that broke all the rules.

305
00:16:52.665 --> 00:16:55.368
♪ Wish I had her beside me ♪

306
00:16:55.938 --> 00:16:58.618
It's funny... I wasn't even aware...
it was... I was watching the film,


307
00:16:58.643 --> 00:17:01.579
but I was rooting for both of
them to be together until the act...


308
00:17:01.604 --> 00:17:04.298
end moment where
she's giving him a blow job,


309
00:17:04.416 --> 00:17:07.423
and he's degrading her
as if she's not in the room,


310
00:17:07.771 --> 00:17:11.250
uh, pretending that she's not there, and
then they have this moment where they...


311
00:17:11.275 --> 00:17:14.735
they come together.
It's just... it's beautiful.


312
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.835
You know why most people have sexual
problems? They talk too goddamn much!


313
00:17:22.502 --> 00:17:26.094
Jamie is a very sweet
person on one hand,


314
00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:28.837
and on the other hand, is
a very disturbed individual.


315
00:17:29.174 --> 00:17:30.461
Jamie had his demons.

316
00:17:30.486 --> 00:17:33.436
You instantly just are
so engaged by him.


317
00:17:33.461 --> 00:17:36.094
In fact, when I started watching
the... the opening in "Misty Beethoven,"


318
00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:39.174
I wasn't even aware that Jamie
Gillis was a porn performer.


319
00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:42.220
I thought he was going to
not have any sex in the movie,


320
00:17:42.416 --> 00:17:44.085
because he was so good.

321
00:17:44.353 --> 00:17:47.383
You think to yourself, "How
could this guy be a porn actor?"


322
00:17:47.408 --> 00:17:49.955
Working for Radley
Metzger was, um...


323
00:17:51.845 --> 00:17:55.988
I don't really know. I... I don't
know how to really say it...


324
00:17:56.673 --> 00:18:00.611
it comes back to that thing, "If
you can't say anything nice..."


325
00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.525
Okay, let's get you undressed.

326
00:18:04.432 --> 00:18:06.500
No, no, no, you
don't do it yourself.


327
00:18:07.306 --> 00:18:08.978
You don't know
how, for one thing.


328
00:18:09.096 --> 00:18:13.322
He told me he didn't think I could act, and
that's why he put me through everything.


329
00:18:13.439 --> 00:18:14.681
That was his justification.

330
00:18:15.252 --> 00:18:17.400
I think men stink.

331
00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:20.085
Well, they think you stink.

332
00:18:20.806 --> 00:18:23.586
In fact, it's one of the most perfectly
balanced equations in nature.


333
00:18:23.611 --> 00:18:26.548
I'd like to say that movie was made
more with blood and sweat than money.


334
00:18:26.693 --> 00:18:29.384
He really did make
a masterpiece.


335
00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:31.661
I've heard so many
people quote lines from it


336
00:18:31.685 --> 00:18:33.618
that he must have been
doing something right.


337
00:18:33.767 --> 00:18:37.305
It has an extremely strong
story with beautiful imagery.


338
00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.368
And, also, I mean, looking at it
all these years later, it was also...


339
00:18:40.564 --> 00:18:42.070
I mean I looked
pretty good, too.


340
00:18:42.095 --> 00:18:45.946
I think it was also the fact that
it was more reality than fantasy.


341
00:18:46.282 --> 00:18:49.959
There is so much going
on within that movie that


342
00:18:49.983 --> 00:18:53.738
really says, "This is an
artistic pornographic film".


343
00:18:54.495 --> 00:18:56.207
Excuse me. Uh, pardon me.

344
00:18:56.332 --> 00:18:57.957
Do you mind if I
blow your waiter?


345
00:18:58.481 --> 00:18:59.371
Not at all.

346
00:19:01.347 --> 00:19:03.558
I don't know what on
earth happened to mine.


347
00:19:03.707 --> 00:19:06.034
Barbara Broadcast
was a movie about


348
00:19:06.059 --> 00:19:08.346
a woman who is a sex
worker who wrote a book.


349
00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:10.924
It's taking place at a restaurant,
and people are giving blow jobs


350
00:19:10.949 --> 00:19:13.159
as if it's no big deal.
Nobody's batting an eye,


351
00:19:13.184 --> 00:19:15.293
nobody's looking
at it as if it's odd.


352
00:19:15.512 --> 00:19:17.214
People are having sex on tables.

353
00:19:17.465 --> 00:19:21.516
And it was what I feel a true adult
should... film should be, where there's


354
00:19:21.541 --> 00:19:24.830
absolutely zero judgment about
everything that's going on around them.


355
00:19:25.336 --> 00:19:27.510
Yes, we'll have your
reservation in about five minutes.


356
00:19:27.698 --> 00:19:28.752
Thank you very much.

357
00:19:29.189 --> 00:19:30.197
You're quite welcome.

358
00:19:37.924 --> 00:19:42.284
There's a lot of jokes in "Barbara Broadcast."
One of them is when the maitre 'd, um,


359
00:19:42.309 --> 00:19:46.044
he receives a blow job every time
somebody drops a plate or messes up.


360
00:19:46.426 --> 00:19:48.947
And it's just so
cavalier in that he just


361
00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:51.572
unbuttons his pants, and
they get down on their knees.


362
00:19:56.994 --> 00:20:00.524
Well, Bobby Aster I remember very
well, because he's the very first person


363
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:03.033
that I ever worked in
any movie any time.


364
00:20:03.095 --> 00:20:07.227
Annette Haven's a beautiful woman,
and it lends itself to this idea that


365
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.471
you can be a beautiful
woman and be a sexual woman.


366
00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:15.065
My brother's kind of shy, and,
well, he's a big, big fan of yours.


367
00:20:15.527 --> 00:20:18.251
Well, would you mind giving him
an autograph and a little head?


368
00:20:18.478 --> 00:20:22.252
Annette, um, was
just, uh, just one of the


369
00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:27.017
most flawlessly beautiful woman I had
ever seen, let alone I think it was the...


370
00:20:27.236 --> 00:20:29.502
the first red bush
that I had ever seen.


371
00:20:29.744 --> 00:20:32.502
Serious as a heart attack
and a great businesswoman,


372
00:20:32.527 --> 00:20:35.127
and, uh, nuttier than
a fruitcake as well.


373
00:20:35.205 --> 00:20:39.009
In "Barbara Broadcast," Metzger's
using these very wide shots


374
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.641
where you're seeing
sexual activity happening


375
00:20:41.666 --> 00:20:45.572
while there is dialogue happening
between the main characters.


376
00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:48.345
There also was another joke in
"Barbara Broadcast" that I loved


377
00:20:48.439 --> 00:20:50.812
where I believe it was they
ordered up a number 17,


378
00:20:51.134 --> 00:20:53.736
which, basically, was
a man came on a salad.


379
00:20:53.861 --> 00:20:55.768
He does a
wonderful cafe au lait.


380
00:20:56.174 --> 00:20:58.559
It's cinematically beautiful,
the locations, I mean,


381
00:20:58.839 --> 00:21:02.227
shooting at, uh, a restaurant.
I mean, the kitchen scene


382
00:21:02.252 --> 00:21:05.035
with C.J. Laing with all the
steam and the pots and the pans


383
00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.416
and the this and the that and...

384
00:21:06.517 --> 00:21:08.727
They took a scene from
"Misty Beethoven," I understand,


385
00:21:08.752 --> 00:21:12.134
as a filler for the gigantic
clim... climax of the film.


386
00:21:12.322 --> 00:21:15.657
So we have this little pet working
for us, and to set her straight,


387
00:21:15.682 --> 00:21:19.048
we let curly at her, to act
out one of his fantasies.


388
00:21:19.322 --> 00:21:21.564
Jimmy wasn't very nice to
me when he first met me.


389
00:21:21.589 --> 00:21:24.029
Jimmy beat the crap out
of me. The makeup lady,


390
00:21:24.054 --> 00:21:26.757
she kept putting more hairpieces in
my hair, more and more hairpieces.


391
00:21:26.782 --> 00:21:30.390
She said, "Well, I don't want her
brains to spill out on the concrete".


392
00:21:30.853 --> 00:21:32.808
and Jamie said, "Well,
if it's gonna be realistic...


393
00:21:32.832 --> 00:21:34.380
if they're gonna come out,
they're gonna come out.


394
00:21:34.413 --> 00:21:36.131
Stop putting those
hairpieces in her hair."


395
00:21:36.156 --> 00:21:37.812
I didn't even know
what was going on.


396
00:21:42.851 --> 00:21:45.702
Jamie would call me whenever he
was in kind of one bind or another.


397
00:21:45.781 --> 00:21:47.691
He says, "Mitch, you've
gotta come here right away.


398
00:21:47.715 --> 00:21:49.595
You've gotta come right...
right away," and I hear this,


399
00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:52.761
like, water sound,
like, this flushing sound.


400
00:21:52.786 --> 00:21:53.737
He's like, "Hurry, hurry."

401
00:21:53.762 --> 00:21:55.830
So I threw something
on, and I jumped in a cab.


402
00:21:55.855 --> 00:21:57.628
I get there, and...

403
00:21:58.339 --> 00:22:01.919
Jamie was fucking
C.J. From behind,


404
00:22:02.176 --> 00:22:04.994
but had her head immersed
in the toilet bowl, and she had


405
00:22:05.019 --> 00:22:06.877
a necklace on, and
the catch got caught,


406
00:22:06.902 --> 00:22:10.620
and so he had to keep flushing
the toilet in order for her to get air.


407
00:22:11.129 --> 00:22:13.585
And I got the catch from
underneath her neck, and, uh,


408
00:22:13.585 --> 00:22:15.714
she comes up for air and
says, "You wanna join us?"


409
00:22:15.824 --> 00:22:17.768
I'll give you $10 if you
let me look at your tits.


410
00:22:17.793 --> 00:22:19.260
Mr. Greenfield!

411
00:22:19.285 --> 00:22:22.347
Please, please, I just wanna
look at your pretty little tits.


412
00:22:22.496 --> 00:22:24.214
You know we're all good girls.

413
00:22:24.644 --> 00:22:27.136
The director at the time... I'd
worked for him quite a few times...


414
00:22:27.161 --> 00:22:29.527
I helped cast some
people in that film.


415
00:22:29.552 --> 00:22:34.714
I also, um, found a way to
get access to Brooklyn college.


416
00:22:34.785 --> 00:22:39.308
I lived close to the area. And we
kinda knew when the facilities were open.


417
00:22:39.333 --> 00:22:42.088
We... it was like "Do what
you can when you can."


418
00:22:42.113 --> 00:22:44.715
We just lucked out. We didn't
get caught doing anything.


419
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:51.902
I don't think I was ever on set
when Bambi Woods was on set.


420
00:22:51.927 --> 00:22:53.253
Maybe I met her one time.

421
00:22:53.277 --> 00:22:56.613
She was, for that time,
incredibly hot-looking.


422
00:22:56.707 --> 00:22:57.800
Debbie, what are you gonna do?

423
00:22:57.902 --> 00:22:59.129
Raise the money fast.

424
00:22:59.347 --> 00:23:00.199
When do you have
to leave, Debbie?


425
00:23:00.255 --> 00:23:01.270
In two weeks.

426
00:23:01.802 --> 00:23:03.895
But that's not enough
time to raise the fare.


427
00:23:07.255 --> 00:23:09.583
The worst thing about
"Debbie Does Dallas"


428
00:23:09.911 --> 00:23:13.075
is R. Bolla's the only
guy that gets to fuck her.


429
00:23:13.309 --> 00:23:16.136
You wanna fuck that girl. I
mean, it's a complete tease.


430
00:23:16.161 --> 00:23:19.380
It's a... it's a cock-teasing
film, and it worked on that level.


431
00:23:25.793 --> 00:23:27.700
Six, seven, eight...

432
00:23:28.801 --> 00:23:29.543
Oh!

433
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:38.661
The Dallas cowboys started the whole
cheerleader craze, and it really went viral.


434
00:23:39.052 --> 00:23:40.509
If you could use
that word back then.


435
00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:43.320
And somebody was smart
enough to capitalize on that.


436
00:23:43.345 --> 00:23:46.906
They didn't have any idea
it would blow up like it did.


437
00:23:46.931 --> 00:23:48.767
It just was an enormous hit.

438
00:23:48.971 --> 00:23:49.947
No, mom.

439
00:23:51.095 --> 00:23:52.540
You know I'm
gonna stay with you.


440
00:23:52.673 --> 00:23:54.892
Oh, darling, I'm so glad.

441
00:23:58.997 --> 00:24:00.989
I had never head
of Kirdy Stevens.


442
00:24:01.014 --> 00:24:05.790
We met... we met at a
restaurant in, um, west L.A.,


443
00:24:06.397 --> 00:24:08.664
and he told me it
was about incest,


444
00:24:08.689 --> 00:24:10.461
and I said, "No,
absolutely not."


445
00:24:10.955 --> 00:24:12.711
I loved "Taboo" as a movie.

446
00:24:12.736 --> 00:24:16.008
In fact, the ending was so
disturbing and bothersome to me


447
00:24:16.033 --> 00:24:20.344
that she didn't end up with her son,
it made me question my own morals.


448
00:24:20.369 --> 00:24:23.275
He persisted, and then, um,

449
00:24:24.267 --> 00:24:29.392
again, I... I can only describe this as
my higher self jumped in and said, "Do it."


450
00:24:30.322 --> 00:24:32.236
Because somebody's
going to do it.


451
00:24:32.767 --> 00:24:37.861
You... if you do it, you can bring
consciousness and quality to it, so do it.


452
00:24:37.886 --> 00:24:41.001
We are censoring ourselves
from doing things that are as


453
00:24:41.032 --> 00:24:44.625
free and as open as
they were 35 years ago.


454
00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.978
I mean they were
more free 35 years ago.


455
00:24:47.049 --> 00:24:49.953
I hated the script
the first time I read it.


456
00:24:49.978 --> 00:24:53.336
It was... it was
really difficult to,


457
00:24:53.361 --> 00:24:56.250
um... to read about incest

458
00:24:56.275 --> 00:24:59.469
in such a sort of
flippant, um, manner.


459
00:24:59.494 --> 00:25:00.892
But it was so wrong.

460
00:25:01.111 --> 00:25:04.118
Look, ma, I don't think
any less of either one of us.


461
00:25:05.298 --> 00:25:06.259
It happened,

462
00:25:07.439 --> 00:25:08.603
and I gotta tell ya,

463
00:25:09.611 --> 00:25:11.056
I want it to happen again.

464
00:25:11.861 --> 00:25:15.282
Don't... don't...
no, Paul, don't.


465
00:25:17.197 --> 00:25:19.634
The world has a
dirty word for this.


466
00:25:19.775 --> 00:25:22.351
There's these... these moments
that kind of make you say,


467
00:25:22.376 --> 00:25:24.044
"Whoa!" these jarring moments,

468
00:25:24.069 --> 00:25:26.047
like, for example, when
Kay Parker is in the kitchen,


469
00:25:26.072 --> 00:25:27.617
and her breast is
hanging out of her shirt,


470
00:25:27.642 --> 00:25:29.243
and she's standing
there with her son,


471
00:25:29.454 --> 00:25:31.945
and it's almost as if
there's no covering up,


472
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.595
and it... it's just,
again, sex is out there.


473
00:25:34.806 --> 00:25:37.587
I mean I'm not exactly
over-the-hill, you know.


474
00:25:40.243 --> 00:25:41.556
You're telling me.

475
00:25:41.743 --> 00:25:44.218
You see it a lot with Kay
Parker's friend in the movie,


476
00:25:44.243 --> 00:25:47.611
who is having orgies and... and
doesn't have any issues with...


477
00:25:47.636 --> 00:25:51.257
she thinks it's hot imagining that
her son would be having sex with her.


478
00:25:51.282 --> 00:25:54.373
She references that Kay
Parker is, you know, has been


479
00:25:54.397 --> 00:25:56.752
kind of assaulted by her boss.

480
00:25:56.777 --> 00:25:59.179
And she's on the phone with
her friend, and the friend says...


481
00:25:59.204 --> 00:26:00.517
What's going on over there?

482
00:26:02.419 --> 00:26:03.810
Is Jerry raping you?

483
00:26:03.835 --> 00:26:06.132
Cut that out, you
son-of-a-bitch!


484
00:26:06.157 --> 00:26:07.493
What's he doing?

485
00:26:08.657 --> 00:26:10.086
Does he have his cock out?

486
00:26:10.111 --> 00:26:13.197
But it... it... it lends itself
to this idea that there's


487
00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:16.505
lots of different things
that people find sexually


488
00:26:16.529 --> 00:26:19.947
arousing, even if it is
nec... even if it is forbidden.


489
00:26:20.517 --> 00:26:23.828
Whenever I think about the...
the scene, the seduction scene


490
00:26:23.853 --> 00:26:26.570
with Mike Ranger in
"Taboo," I... I get gooseflesh...


491
00:26:26.595 --> 00:26:29.406
I'm getting right now, as I...
as I get ready to talk about it,


492
00:26:29.431 --> 00:26:32.697
because I do
refer to it as a very,


493
00:26:33.189 --> 00:26:35.382
um, spiritual experience.

494
00:26:35.407 --> 00:26:38.333
She's just left this
orgy party that she


495
00:26:38.357 --> 00:26:40.742
felt extremely uncomfortable
and did not participate in,


496
00:26:40.767 --> 00:26:45.884
and she just finds it within
herself that she must have sex,


497
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:48.611
and he's safe for
her. He is safe.


498
00:26:54.829 --> 00:26:57.204
I lost myself in that scene.

499
00:26:57.391 --> 00:26:59.211
I was not there.

500
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.779
I surrendered, if
you will, to the part,


501
00:27:03.001 --> 00:27:07.048
and the part, or the role,
the mother, just took me,


502
00:27:07.556 --> 00:27:09.720
um, on this trip.

503
00:27:09.907 --> 00:27:11.398
It was almost like, yes,

504
00:27:11.423 --> 00:27:14.681
this is the natural thing that should
happen between my mother and I.


505
00:27:15.752 --> 00:27:16.447
That's...

506
00:27:16.472 --> 00:27:17.127
(interviewer) I'm appalled.

507
00:27:17.152 --> 00:27:20.535
There's nothing wronger
and more right than that.


508
00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.102
What'll it be, gents?

509
00:27:22.127 --> 00:27:25.579
Oh, the master will have
a beer, anything imported.


510
00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:28.478
Bottle of buffalo piss, please.

511
00:27:29.025 --> 00:27:32.169
The Amero brothers
made a big budget comedy.


512
00:27:32.368 --> 00:27:33.662
We just had a lot of fun.

513
00:27:33.686 --> 00:27:37.545
I swear, the burning of
Atlanta scene or whatever was


514
00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.209
the funniest thing I've ever
seen in an X rated movie.


515
00:27:40.234 --> 00:27:44.639
Now, remember, pay no attention to me when
I'm talking to you, just do what I say.


516
00:27:44.664 --> 00:27:47.921
This is a very simple little
scene I'd like to get done quickly,


517
00:27:48.101 --> 00:27:51.101
because we are shooting the
bombing of Atlanta this afternoon.


518
00:27:56.374 --> 00:27:57.585
Put up a fight girls!

519
00:27:58.648 --> 00:28:01.843
It was funny and quirky.

520
00:28:02.328 --> 00:28:06.607
It was... it was
very horny, for sure.


521
00:28:06.632 --> 00:28:08.474
It had so many sex scenes.

522
00:28:08.499 --> 00:28:09.851
I was really impressed.

523
00:28:10.085 --> 00:28:11.687
I did it in a boat once,

524
00:28:12.953 --> 00:28:15.312
and I had to do all the rowing.

525
00:28:15.671 --> 00:28:18.764
R. Bolla and I are in Wyoming,

526
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:22.156
where we meet the cane sisters.

527
00:28:27.187 --> 00:28:30.203
I decide to take them
to New York with us,


528
00:28:30.492 --> 00:28:32.585
and... and she
says something like,


529
00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.521
"What, you got an airplane?"

530
00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:38.752
Anyway, I'm to be queen of the fairies,
and I've got this terrific gown rigged up.


531
00:28:39.179 --> 00:28:40.062
A gown?

532
00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:42.015
Are you one of
those transylvanians?


533
00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.224
Susie Mandell was the...

534
00:28:44.249 --> 00:28:47.002
my favorite of the
two characters.


535
00:28:47.179 --> 00:28:49.445
Candy, what's a film loop?

536
00:28:50.172 --> 00:28:51.213
You've got me.

537
00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:55.148
They're looking for

538
00:28:55.173 --> 00:28:58.623
It was really a
tribute to the, uh,


539
00:28:58.648 --> 00:29:02.724
MGM movies, only
with hardcore sex.


540
00:29:02.959 --> 00:29:03.654
Fuck.

541
00:29:04.623 --> 00:29:09.615
The rape scene where the Yankees
came in and, like, banged all the chicks.


542
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.685
I want a cum shot, or none
of you faggots get paid!


543
00:29:16.966 --> 00:29:20.593
"Blonde Ambition" was
playing in New York...


544
00:29:20.617 --> 00:29:23.574
the R-rated version
at one theater,


545
00:29:23.599 --> 00:29:27.162
and the X-rated version at
another at the same time.


546
00:29:27.494 --> 00:29:30.013
It's Sandy, am I right?

547
00:29:30.685 --> 00:29:32.912
Oh, but there is an
amazing resemblance.


548
00:29:33.646 --> 00:29:35.841
But now that I look
at you, I can see that...


549
00:29:36.209 --> 00:29:38.052
Well, is my sister here or not?

550
00:29:38.752 --> 00:29:42.880
"Neon Nights" had
a very unusual plot.


551
00:29:43.177 --> 00:29:45.302
Veronica Hart played a madame,

552
00:29:45.845 --> 00:29:50.245
and I was kind of her boy-toy,
if you wanna call it that.


553
00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.013
I'm gonna make you sweat, baby.

554
00:29:52.543 --> 00:29:55.075
You're my private
fucking machine, right?!


555
00:29:55.833 --> 00:29:58.536
The film was actually
kind of fucked up.


556
00:29:58.622 --> 00:30:02.329
Um, the daughter is
listening to her mom and her


557
00:30:02.353 --> 00:30:04.597
mom's boyfriend have
sex in the next room,


558
00:30:04.622 --> 00:30:07.716
and then she starts
masturbating with a hairbrush.


559
00:30:07.950 --> 00:30:10.075
And then she's in the bathroom,

560
00:30:10.302 --> 00:30:13.161
and he comes in, and
he's telling her to shush


561
00:30:13.294 --> 00:30:15.966
and turn around, and he's
grabbing on her and touching her.


562
00:30:16.466 --> 00:30:17.528
No.

563
00:30:18.184 --> 00:30:20.239
Turn around, come on.

564
00:30:20.856 --> 00:30:21.997
Turn around, baby.

565
00:30:23.849 --> 00:30:24.747
That's a girl.

566
00:30:26.153 --> 00:30:27.145
That's a good girl.

567
00:30:27.708 --> 00:30:30.393
When Jake Teague makes
Lysa Thatcher elevate,


568
00:30:30.418 --> 00:30:31.840
they did it very
well, like, he was


569
00:30:31.865 --> 00:30:33.887
putting his arms
underneath her butt


570
00:30:34.074 --> 00:30:36.567
and over her boobs and
over her vagina and, like,


571
00:30:36.832 --> 00:30:38.676
doing the whole
creepy thing, and then


572
00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.098
I love how he got in her mind.

573
00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.538
He was having sex
with another woman


574
00:30:43.762 --> 00:30:45.621
while he was inside of her mind,

575
00:30:45.746 --> 00:30:48.543
and she was feeling everything that
him and the other woman were doing.


576
00:30:49.098 --> 00:30:51.044
I thought that was
pretty interesting.


577
00:30:51.395 --> 00:30:55.606
So Veronica, back
home, is taking a shower,


578
00:30:56.597 --> 00:31:02.057
and a la Hitchcock
in "Psycho," uh,


579
00:31:02.807 --> 00:31:05.360
I enter... but I had
some flowers...


580
00:31:05.385 --> 00:31:08.276
and I pull back the
curtain, and she screams.


581
00:31:15.276 --> 00:31:16.253
Gotcha!

582
00:31:16.752 --> 00:31:18.276
Oh, man, were you ever goin'!

583
00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:19.181
No!

584
00:31:19.206 --> 00:31:21.323
Peeing in your pants,
you were so scared.


585
00:31:22.808 --> 00:31:23.933
You fuck!

586
00:31:24.362 --> 00:31:27.931
She's all pissed off at that, and
then we go off in the bedroom


587
00:31:27.956 --> 00:31:31.417
and make really frantic
and hard, hard sex.


588
00:31:31.526 --> 00:31:32.806
I thought he did very well at

589
00:31:32.831 --> 00:31:35.995
keeping the plot together and
making it an interesting movie that


590
00:31:36.315 --> 00:31:38.339
is, not only risky and

591
00:31:38.784 --> 00:31:40.972
different and very
interesting with the


592
00:31:41.175 --> 00:31:44.444
magician and her hitch-hiking
and being in love with her


593
00:31:44.468 --> 00:31:47.964
mother's boyfriend, you
know? It's very different.


594
00:31:48.081 --> 00:31:49.518
I wanna give it a try.

595
00:31:49.886 --> 00:31:51.659
I don't wanna look
back with regrets.


596
00:31:51.752 --> 00:31:53.579
You know, if only
I'd gone to New York,


597
00:31:53.604 --> 00:31:55.128
I could've been on Broadway.

598
00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:59.761
The plot of "Roommates" is,
a woman has an apartment,


599
00:31:59.964 --> 00:32:02.151
and she happens to be a hooker,

600
00:32:02.542 --> 00:32:04.634
and she decides to
get out of the business.


601
00:32:04.659 --> 00:32:06.800
And her apartment's
too big for her, so she


602
00:32:06.948 --> 00:32:09.409
consigns two roommates
to come and live with her.


603
00:32:09.539 --> 00:32:10.447
Well, there you have it...

604
00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:12.339
confessions of an ex-call-girl.

605
00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:15.796
One was, uh, a
beautiful, gorgeous model,


606
00:32:16.026 --> 00:32:18.865
who, unfortunately, seemed
to have a drug problem


607
00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:20.423
and get in with a bad person.

608
00:32:20.448 --> 00:32:22.722
And I played a college student

609
00:32:23.104 --> 00:32:26.518
who, actually, I think, ran away
from college. I was having an affair


610
00:32:26.792 --> 00:32:30.198
with my college professor,
and it finally dawned on me that


611
00:32:30.745 --> 00:32:31.862
he didn't love me at all.

612
00:32:31.995 --> 00:32:34.808
My character had some
bad people in her life,


613
00:32:35.222 --> 00:32:39.007
and, uh, stuff happens
because I run rampant,


614
00:32:39.425 --> 00:32:40.947
and I kind of learn my lesson.

615
00:32:40.972 --> 00:32:41.722
Where am I?

616
00:32:42.245 --> 00:32:44.447
You're in queens. Where
the fuck do you think you are?


617
00:32:44.472 --> 00:32:47.793
The famous rape scene
from "Roommates."


618
00:32:48.136 --> 00:32:50.087
So much of it was inferred.

619
00:32:50.112 --> 00:32:53.136
The backs of the actors
were to the camera.


620
00:32:53.331 --> 00:32:54.511
I was laying on the floor.

621
00:32:54.792 --> 00:32:56.870
Rub some on her
face, Sal, rub it in.


622
00:32:56.895 --> 00:32:57.979
Make her eat it.

623
00:32:58.706 --> 00:33:00.667
Again, you hear the sounds,

624
00:33:00.901 --> 00:33:02.308
you hear their voices,

625
00:33:02.503 --> 00:33:06.214
you can only imagine the worst
possible thing is happening to me.


626
00:33:06.294 --> 00:33:08.042
Jamie Gillis comes bursting in,

627
00:33:08.377 --> 00:33:10.112
starts knocking the guys aside,

628
00:33:10.206 --> 00:33:12.752
and then Jamie starts
doing Jamie Gillis.


629
00:33:13.181 --> 00:33:14.150
- Did they hurt you?
- No.


630
00:33:14.175 --> 00:33:15.526
Let me see if they hurt you.

631
00:33:16.878 --> 00:33:18.877
They stuck the bottle...
did they hurt you with...


632
00:33:18.949 --> 00:33:22.050
did they hurt you with the bottle
when they... when they shoved it in?


633
00:33:22.386 --> 00:33:25.566
He's not there to help me, he's
there to jerk off on me, you know?


634
00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.574
Sick, twisted Jamie Gillis.

635
00:33:28.363 --> 00:33:31.117
He wasn't interested in
degrading anybody, you know?


636
00:33:31.141 --> 00:33:34.308
Chuck's idea of a great
time was to... to have fun.


637
00:33:36.058 --> 00:33:37.518
Come on, you guys are animals.

638
00:33:37.543 --> 00:33:38.503
Take a break already.

639
00:33:39.377 --> 00:33:41.503
It didn't fit into any category.

640
00:33:41.628 --> 00:33:44.111
So Chuck really went
out on a limb to make this.


641
00:33:44.136 --> 00:33:46.082
It was one of the first movies

642
00:33:46.378 --> 00:33:49.549
where everybody wasn't running
around, going "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me."


643
00:33:49.574 --> 00:33:51.228
In the end of the 1970s,

644
00:33:51.253 --> 00:33:53.597
theatrical porn films
begin to struggle.


645
00:33:53.925 --> 00:33:55.995
Obscenity prosecutions rose,

646
00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.442
zoning laws had forced adult
theaters into the worst neighborhoods,


647
00:33:59.559 --> 00:34:02.231
and the porn chic that
fueled ticket sales died out.


648
00:34:02.809 --> 00:34:06.458
But there was a new frontier
opening for adult movie producers...


649
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.739
the VCR was about to redefine
the porn industry once again.


650
00:34:10.801 --> 00:34:14.518
When did people
start to buy VHS's?


651
00:34:14.543 --> 00:34:16.040
When was that
starting to be the norm


652
00:34:16.064 --> 00:34:18.044
versus, uh, going
to the theater?


653
00:34:18.127 --> 00:34:20.192
In the mid-'70s, the
machines came out,


654
00:34:20.708 --> 00:34:24.309
and people thought this was the greatest
invention since sliced white bread.


655
00:34:24.786 --> 00:34:26.628
And they had to have
one... you had it right.


656
00:34:26.653 --> 00:34:29.458
But, like you said, they were
expensive. They were $1,000 a machine.


657
00:34:29.575 --> 00:34:34.426
And the movies
themselves were... $95.


658
00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:35.948
They would have parties, though.

659
00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:37.794
They would go in and
chip in and buy a movie.


660
00:34:37.819 --> 00:34:40.543
There was more work than...
than girls in the business.


661
00:34:40.543 --> 00:34:43.720
Like, there were, like, 12 of us
really in the business, it seemed,


662
00:34:44.137 --> 00:34:47.323
and I think we all shot
like 29 out of 30 days.


663
00:34:47.348 --> 00:34:48.995
I mean, it was just... the...

664
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.085
the producers couldn't
get enough girls.


665
00:34:51.653 --> 00:34:54.877
So what was it like shooting...
what was a day on set like back then?


666
00:34:55.223 --> 00:34:58.089
Um, let's see, there
was usually a script,


667
00:34:58.114 --> 00:35:00.776
like, a 20-page script,
which always irritated me,


668
00:35:00.801 --> 00:35:02.622
'cause I was not good
at memorizing things.


669
00:35:02.942 --> 00:35:05.761
It was always shot at,
like, a really nice house,


670
00:35:05.786 --> 00:35:08.550
the location... not always,
but for the most part it was,


671
00:35:08.575 --> 00:35:12.085
you know, shot in really nice
houses up in porn valley somewhere.


672
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:15.715
They always had catering, hair,
and makeup. I mean, it was like...


673
00:35:16.208 --> 00:35:20.433
in a weird way, it was kinda
like being on a real movie set,


674
00:35:20.458 --> 00:35:22.098
only we were naked having sex.

675
00:35:22.123 --> 00:35:24.589
You could actually see
the playback at... on the set.


676
00:35:24.614 --> 00:35:25.934
It was like a whole new world.

677
00:35:26.411 --> 00:35:29.590
But the video quality in
those days was not the best.


678
00:35:30.551 --> 00:35:32.754
But everybody wanted to
do it because it was cheap,


679
00:35:32.779 --> 00:35:34.317
it was quick, it was painless.

680
00:35:34.489 --> 00:35:36.793
So, as a performer, what...

681
00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:39.198
Did the consumers
sort of expect from you?


682
00:35:39.223 --> 00:35:40.690
Like, were you guys shooting

683
00:35:40.715 --> 00:35:42.222
- a lot of crazy sex acts?
- Nudity.


684
00:35:42.247 --> 00:35:42.575
No.

685
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.714
Or did they want you to be a
good actress? Did they care?


686
00:35:45.739 --> 00:35:46.667
Did they just wanna see your...

687
00:35:46.692 --> 00:35:48.985
I think, in 1984,
they were just happy


688
00:35:49.009 --> 00:35:51.673
that they could watch
a film in their house


689
00:35:51.697 --> 00:35:53.590
of a naked girl
sucking a guy's dick.


690
00:35:53.615 --> 00:35:55.706
Like, there was definitely no

691
00:35:55.731 --> 00:35:58.075
crazy sex acts like there
are... I mean, it was kinda like,


692
00:35:58.637 --> 00:36:02.034
you know, the typical
three positions, head,


693
00:36:02.067 --> 00:36:04.933
him eating me out,
but it wasn't crazy sex.


694
00:36:04.958 --> 00:36:07.051
I really think, back in
'84, people were just so


695
00:36:07.076 --> 00:36:08.973
happy that they could
watch people have sex


696
00:36:09.013 --> 00:36:10.732
on film in there house.

697
00:36:11.176 --> 00:36:15.766
Good evening, mutants
and mutettes, and welcome


698
00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.340
to Cafe Flesh.

699
00:36:19.965 --> 00:36:22.436
The storyline is there's been

700
00:36:22.551 --> 00:36:25.145
some kind of
apocalyptic sort of thing.


701
00:36:25.676 --> 00:36:28.227
and, in the wake of that,

702
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.192
there are some people

703
00:36:30.653 --> 00:36:33.317
who can still stand the touch

704
00:36:33.342 --> 00:36:36.536
of another human being,
and the rest of them can't.


705
00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:38.300
Trust me, folks, I
know what you want,


706
00:36:38.325 --> 00:36:40.911
and I know what it feels
like when you don't get it.


707
00:36:41.614 --> 00:36:45.419
Need is my fix,
ladies and gentlemen.


708
00:36:45.614 --> 00:36:48.019
And so the people who
can touch other people


709
00:36:48.044 --> 00:36:49.925
and, therefore, have sex are

710
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:54.347
forced to stage
these live sex shows


711
00:36:54.372 --> 00:36:57.456
for the people who
can't have sex like that.


712
00:36:57.481 --> 00:37:00.100
It's, like, weird
and experimental,


713
00:37:00.125 --> 00:37:02.386
but then it's got
this very obvious


714
00:37:02.411 --> 00:37:05.183
metaphor about pornography

715
00:37:05.208 --> 00:37:06.559
and its place in the world.

716
00:37:06.715 --> 00:37:09.294
Leaving so soon, friend?

717
00:37:09.739 --> 00:37:11.645
Feeling a little queasy?

718
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.501
Live theater, on the other hand,

719
00:37:13.525 --> 00:37:15.312
and the history of live theater,

720
00:37:15.336 --> 00:37:17.751
you can see a lot of
where "Cafe Flesh's"


721
00:37:17.775 --> 00:37:19.854
references probably came from.

722
00:37:19.879 --> 00:37:22.110
"Cafe Flesh" stands
the test of time


723
00:37:22.134 --> 00:37:25.956
because it's a
porno about porno.


724
00:37:25.981 --> 00:37:28.768
It, it very much is what it is,

725
00:37:28.793 --> 00:37:31.294
and there's something so

726
00:37:31.319 --> 00:37:33.747
wonderfully honest about it.

727
00:37:33.772 --> 00:37:36.060
But then it's got all of the

728
00:37:36.085 --> 00:37:39.573
other layers, so it
remains interesting.


729
00:37:39.598 --> 00:37:42.208
I mean, you watch
it six or seven times,


730
00:37:42.233 --> 00:37:44.294
you're still gonna be
seeing new parts to it.


731
00:37:45.278 --> 00:37:48.056
Does it ever bother you
fucking your best friend's wife?


732
00:37:51.103 --> 00:37:52.408
You're in for it now.

733
00:37:53.017 --> 00:37:56.484
"Scoundrels" was the first film to
win a best picture award from AVN.


734
00:37:56.509 --> 00:37:59.187
And I was the lead, and
Howard said to me, Cecil Howard,


735
00:37:59.212 --> 00:38:00.992
"You're not gonna
crack one joke in this.


736
00:38:01.017 --> 00:38:03.266
You're not gonna be...
no mugging to the camera.


737
00:38:03.291 --> 00:38:04.189
You're not gonna be a ham."

738
00:38:04.244 --> 00:38:06.517
Ron Jeremy scared
me at that time, um...


739
00:38:06.542 --> 00:38:08.656
It was, it was
really odd because,


740
00:38:08.681 --> 00:38:11.712
before I had met Ron Jeremy, I
hadn't heard anything about him,


741
00:38:11.737 --> 00:38:14.388
um, but his headshot to
me looked like the wolf man.


742
00:38:14.413 --> 00:38:16.533
Howard was a tough guy.
Cecil Howard was tough.


743
00:38:16.728 --> 00:38:19.211
He wanted things his
way. But I respect that.


744
00:38:19.236 --> 00:38:21.225
I really enjoyed working
with Cecil Howard,


745
00:38:21.249 --> 00:38:23.461
and he was one of
my favorite directors,


746
00:38:23.461 --> 00:38:26.305
and I worked for him
for over 20 movies.


747
00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:28.242
Everything in the
movie is very dark lit


748
00:38:28.267 --> 00:38:30.602
and very dark in general.

749
00:38:30.627 --> 00:38:33.283
The drama of the movie, I
think, is what I like the most.


750
00:38:33.655 --> 00:38:35.744
Ah, I'm gonna change.

751
00:38:41.158 --> 00:38:42.322
That'll be the day.

752
00:38:42.347 --> 00:38:44.267
It's a fascinating psychodrama.

753
00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:48.818
Throughout the movie, I'm in
clown white talking about my life.


754
00:38:48.842 --> 00:38:51.419
I've been good.
I've been real good.


755
00:38:52.072 --> 00:38:54.367
Fuck it, nobody tells
the truth all the time.


756
00:38:54.392 --> 00:38:56.025
Everybody's fucking
everybody in this movie,


757
00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:58.189
but it's not a happy-go-lucky
thing, you know.


758
00:38:58.595 --> 00:39:00.624
The doctor is
cheating on his, um,


759
00:39:00.649 --> 00:39:02.528
his wife with his secretary.

760
00:39:02.553 --> 00:39:05.167
And, you know, his secretary's
cheating on him with his best friend


761
00:39:05.192 --> 00:39:07.114
who, I believe, his wife
is also sleeping with.


762
00:39:10.161 --> 00:39:13.585
And then they have this teenage
daughter who feels invisible.


763
00:39:13.585 --> 00:39:15.002
My perfect parents.

764
00:39:15.715 --> 00:39:17.270
They don't know
anything about me.


765
00:39:17.989 --> 00:39:18.973
What do I like?

766
00:39:20.223 --> 00:39:21.637
I like making love.

767
00:39:21.877 --> 00:39:24.409
So she's taking it out
by becoming a whore


768
00:39:24.434 --> 00:39:26.551
and having all the sex
in the world that she can.


769
00:39:26.576 --> 00:39:29.106
She's the girl at the
candy store on the corner.


770
00:39:29.336 --> 00:39:30.760
That's why I get to
see her every day,


771
00:39:30.784 --> 00:39:32.434
and then finally, I
just tell her to hop in.


772
00:39:32.668 --> 00:39:35.668
She gets in my car, and we're
gonna escape and run away.


773
00:39:36.044 --> 00:39:38.934
My mom always told me
I should marry a doctor.


774
00:39:47.348 --> 00:39:48.817
We crash my car and die.

775
00:39:49.254 --> 00:39:51.739
Which is certainly a statement
against infidelity, you know?


776
00:39:52.114 --> 00:39:53.739
Everybody has a dark side,

777
00:39:53.764 --> 00:39:55.229
and it's really hard to hide

778
00:39:55.254 --> 00:39:56.784
no matter how pretty
your surroundings are.


779
00:39:56.809 --> 00:39:58.565
And this movie really digs into

780
00:39:58.590 --> 00:40:01.128
everybody's sexually
deviant dark side.


781
00:40:01.153 --> 00:40:02.575
No one films like that anymore.

782
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:04.073
Cecil Howard, Chuck Vincent,

783
00:40:04.098 --> 00:40:05.839
Radley Metzger, 
Henri Pachard,

784
00:40:05.864 --> 00:40:07.526
Anthony Spinelli
on the west coast,


785
00:40:07.551 --> 00:40:09.810
these guys made films that
were film that had sex in them.


786
00:40:09.835 --> 00:40:10.895
which had sex in it.

787
00:40:12.942 --> 00:40:14.081
By the way, what's your name?

788
00:40:14.106 --> 00:40:15.144
Elizabeth.

789
00:40:15.169 --> 00:40:15.864
That's a nice name.

790
00:40:20.695 --> 00:40:22.115
Spinelli, his name was Sam,

791
00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:24.125
he was the backbone
of my career.


792
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:26.436
He was more than, uh,

793
00:40:26.461 --> 00:40:27.796
a talented director.

794
00:40:28.234 --> 00:40:30.882
He was making the best movies.

795
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.562
And he became a
friend and a mentor.


796
00:40:33.718 --> 00:40:34.873
Anthony Spinelli...

797
00:40:34.898 --> 00:40:35.755
Who is...

798
00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.607
Who's my... he's a director.

799
00:40:37.927 --> 00:40:39.044
He's my dad.

800
00:40:39.099 --> 00:40:41.084
We collaborated.
It was a great team.


801
00:40:41.529 --> 00:40:43.404
He would usually
say, "I have an idea."


802
00:40:43.502 --> 00:40:46.127
And I'd go, and I'd write
the rough draft, and we, uh,


803
00:40:46.326 --> 00:40:47.392
showed it to him, and we...

804
00:40:47.417 --> 00:40:49.349
great collaboration,
great friendship.


805
00:40:49.396 --> 00:40:51.201
The plot of "Nothing To Hide"

806
00:40:51.419 --> 00:40:53.810
really reminded me
of "Of Mice and Men."


807
00:40:54.365 --> 00:40:56.085
And I think that that's

808
00:40:56.334 --> 00:40:57.302
really different

809
00:40:57.638 --> 00:40:59.224
for a porn movie.

810
00:40:59.249 --> 00:41:01.154
John was schooling
me how to be a man.


811
00:41:01.513 --> 00:41:03.537
And "Love's for suckers,"

812
00:41:03.793 --> 00:41:04.349
he's teaching me.

813
00:41:05.123 --> 00:41:07.537
And I fall in love,
and I wanna marry.


814
00:41:07.654 --> 00:41:09.302
Have you ever loved somebody?

815
00:41:09.791 --> 00:41:10.353
No.

816
00:41:13.752 --> 00:41:15.697
Have you ever wanted
to love somebody?


817
00:41:16.095 --> 00:41:16.908
No.

818
00:41:17.044 --> 00:41:19.633
I think that there is
parts of this movie


819
00:41:19.658 --> 00:41:20.937
that you can jerk-off to.

820
00:41:20.962 --> 00:41:22.533
Slow and deep.

821
00:41:22.558 --> 00:41:24.048
As long as you're
into John Leslie.


822
00:41:24.423 --> 00:41:26.228
One of the scenes in there

823
00:41:26.627 --> 00:41:30.169
has something for
most people to jerk off to.


824
00:41:30.673 --> 00:41:32.267
Oh, Jack!

825
00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:36.298
I'm not sure you can jerk off to

826
00:41:36.509 --> 00:41:37.962
the Richard Pacheco scene.

827
00:41:37.987 --> 00:41:39.908
None of the women
that had come by


828
00:41:40.752 --> 00:41:43.668
fit what Sam wanted to
come out of that character.


829
00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.205
Ah!

830
00:41:47.757 --> 00:41:49.306
Why don't you watch
where you're going?!


831
00:41:49.916 --> 00:41:50.806
She was perfect.

832
00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:52.852
The sex scene between Richard

833
00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:55.585
and Chelsea was my favorite.

834
00:41:55.955 --> 00:41:59.548
It was so real.

835
00:41:59.752 --> 00:42:01.937
I sort of got my...

836
00:42:01.962 --> 00:42:03.844
some spittle on my finger and

837
00:42:03.869 --> 00:42:05.687
played with her
nipple and Spinelli said,


838
00:42:05.712 --> 00:42:07.752
"No, no, no, what are you doing?

839
00:42:07.777 --> 00:42:09.634
Lenny would never do that!"

840
00:42:09.775 --> 00:42:10.447
See?

841
00:42:10.853 --> 00:42:11.970
Oh, is that a rubber?

842
00:42:12.197 --> 00:42:13.119
How'd you know?

843
00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:16.095
I saw one in my
brother's drawer.


844
00:42:16.353 --> 00:42:18.579
I've never seen
that in a porn movie


845
00:42:18.612 --> 00:42:20.908
before where they
actually stop the sex


846
00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:22.922
to put on a condom,
and they talk about


847
00:42:22.947 --> 00:42:25.810
putting on the condom and
how she's never done that before,


848
00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:27.904
and it just... it
was so, so real.


849
00:42:28.244 --> 00:42:29.344
I loved it.

850
00:42:29.369 --> 00:42:31.801
There's a great awkwardness
and playfulness about


851
00:42:32.079 --> 00:42:34.552
winning this, about
putting on the condom


852
00:42:34.576 --> 00:42:36.601
'cause it's played,
played realistically.


853
00:42:36.626 --> 00:42:40.502
Spinelli played the
owner of a hot dog stand.


854
00:42:41.009 --> 00:42:42.431
You don't fool me.

855
00:42:45.204 --> 00:42:47.773
You don't wanna stop being
a mother and a father, right?


856
00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:50.673
He and John have a long
scene where they talk about,


857
00:42:50.978 --> 00:42:53.751
you know, "You're just jealous is
what it is." You're gonna lose the kid.


858
00:42:54.087 --> 00:42:57.158
When AVN did their
first awards, they gave me


859
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:59.400
best actor for "Irresistible",

860
00:42:59.736 --> 00:43:02.876
and they also gave
me best supporting actor


861
00:43:02.901 --> 00:43:04.009
for "Nothing to Hide."

862
00:43:04.626 --> 00:43:08.025
That probably was the
mountain top of my career.


863
00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:10.857
For several months,
I've been writing stories,


864
00:43:10.881 --> 00:43:14.837
not for publication but
for a very curious man,


865
00:43:15.283 --> 00:43:17.023
a private cliterotica.

866
00:43:17.048 --> 00:43:19.334
Janine and I became best friends

867
00:43:19.358 --> 00:43:21.419
when we were 18
and 19 years old.


868
00:43:21.444 --> 00:43:23.883
And I don't think either of
us really knew what to be


869
00:43:23.908 --> 00:43:26.242
totally prepared for. I
think she'd done some...


870
00:43:26.267 --> 00:43:27.419
She'd been a "Penthouse" pet so

871
00:43:27.444 --> 00:43:28.376
she'd done some "Penthouse"

872
00:43:28.401 --> 00:43:30.085
videos, but not exactly the

873
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.353
hardcore we were about
ready to get involved in.


874
00:43:32.378 --> 00:43:33.643
Working with Andrew Blake,

875
00:43:33.668 --> 00:43:37.204
he's, um... he's very

876
00:43:37.543 --> 00:43:39.627
understated, you know, quiet

877
00:43:39.652 --> 00:43:42.156
guy, but his wheels
are always turning.


878
00:43:42.181 --> 00:43:44.486
Andrew Blake is the
quintessential artist.


879
00:43:44.919 --> 00:43:46.668
I mean, he's quirky.

880
00:43:46.954 --> 00:43:48.922
He's interesting.

881
00:43:48.947 --> 00:43:50.477
Somewhat introverted.

882
00:43:50.502 --> 00:43:52.607
Bit of a recluse, uh,

883
00:43:52.631 --> 00:43:54.250
except for when he's
filming, and I think


884
00:43:54.275 --> 00:43:55.941
that's kind of when
it all comes out.


885
00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:58.719
I hired this guy
to make these...


886
00:43:58.744 --> 00:44:02.783
he made, like,
three... ice dildos.


887
00:44:03.072 --> 00:44:04.750
And boy, at the beginning,

888
00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:07.258
there's some mighty hefty ones.

889
00:44:07.283 --> 00:44:08.994
They were quite big.

890
00:44:09.019 --> 00:44:12.521
And when he arrived on the set,

891
00:44:12.545 --> 00:44:16.716
he was bloody, and
he had cut himself,


892
00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:19.919
and he needed to
go to the hospital.


893
00:44:20.244 --> 00:44:22.711
And he dropped off the dildos,

894
00:44:22.736 --> 00:44:24.986
and, you know, I never
heard from him again.


895
00:44:25.908 --> 00:44:27.726
And, of course, by
the time we were done,


896
00:44:27.751 --> 00:44:30.352
we were completely numb.

897
00:44:30.377 --> 00:44:32.883
I didn't know anything
about the adult industry.


898
00:44:32.908 --> 00:44:35.029
At that time of making
"Hidden Obsessions,"


899
00:44:35.053 --> 00:44:36.423
I had never heard of vivid.

900
00:44:36.767 --> 00:44:39.211
I knew nothing about the

901
00:44:39.236 --> 00:44:41.687
big-budget contract girls

902
00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:43.322
and what have you.

903
00:44:43.673 --> 00:44:46.351
I mean, basically, I wanted
to fly under the radar.


904
00:44:46.376 --> 00:44:50.283
That was the wrong
first scene to ever do.


905
00:44:51.056 --> 00:44:55.962
I'm the last man standing,
uh, still shooting film.


906
00:44:56.048 --> 00:45:00.947
When I'm 80, and I'm still
shooting some 19-year-old girl,


907
00:45:01.194 --> 00:45:05.509
and I wanna keel over, and
my Bolex goes into her pussy.


908
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:08.501
That's what I
envision for my self.


909
00:45:08.965 --> 00:45:11.242
Well, I guess these are for

910
00:45:11.267 --> 00:45:13.173
if you're lonely at night and,

911
00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:15.400
uh, need someone to talk to.

912
00:45:15.564 --> 00:45:16.189
Yeah.

913
00:45:16.986 --> 00:45:19.719
I took the idea of "Justine"

914
00:45:19.744 --> 00:45:22.890
from a French film by,

915
00:45:22.915 --> 00:45:25.158
um, a director
named Louis Malle.


916
00:45:25.183 --> 00:45:27.954
It's about a father who

917
00:45:29.025 --> 00:45:32.790
falls for his son's girlfriend.

918
00:45:33.025 --> 00:45:34.033
I said, I've seen it.

919
00:45:34.058 --> 00:45:35.187
And he said, "What'd you think?"

920
00:45:35.212 --> 00:45:36.501
And I said, "I hated it."

921
00:45:37.044 --> 00:45:38.543
He said, "You hated it, why?"

922
00:45:38.767 --> 00:45:41.783
I said, "Because of the
morality of this movie".


923
00:45:41.895 --> 00:45:45.404
That this man
would destroy his son


924
00:45:45.428 --> 00:45:48.876
and his wife for the sake
of of having sex with this girl.


925
00:45:49.033 --> 00:45:52.259
It was an event
of my... sort of...


926
00:45:53.119 --> 00:45:55.789
having a son who's in some
ways more grown-up than me.


927
00:45:55.814 --> 00:45:58.697
He's telling me, you know,
"Come on dad. Get it together".


928
00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:00.939
Why don't you tell me
what you're thinking.


929
00:46:02.744 --> 00:46:04.079
I'm thinking about my father.

930
00:46:05.533 --> 00:46:06.603
Your father?

931
00:46:06.793 --> 00:46:08.736
In "Damage", uh,

932
00:46:09.329 --> 00:46:10.919
Jeremy irons is the father.

933
00:46:11.556 --> 00:46:15.634
He knew that this was his
son's girlfriend. He didn't care.


934
00:46:16.149 --> 00:46:17.259
But in our movie,

935
00:46:18.877 --> 00:46:21.929
the father would
not destroy his son.


936
00:46:21.954 --> 00:46:25.517
He would give up the girl
because his son is his son.


937
00:46:29.462 --> 00:46:30.939
Would you like a taste?

938
00:46:31.853 --> 00:46:33.517
I like our version better.

939
00:46:34.001 --> 00:46:37.986
Roxanne Blaze had a
series of endless orgasms


940
00:46:38.011 --> 00:46:40.094
from a water hose I
was spraying her with.


941
00:46:40.119 --> 00:46:42.228
And that was very real,
it was very interesting.


942
00:46:44.085 --> 00:46:45.767
She's one of his girls,

943
00:46:46.165 --> 00:46:48.591
you would look and... and say,

944
00:46:48.616 --> 00:46:51.764
"What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this?"


945
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:54.225
Why'd you come back, hmm?

946
00:46:54.811 --> 00:46:55.795
Because I shouldn't have.

947
00:46:58.085 --> 00:46:59.638
Because you're dangerous for me.

948
00:46:59.663 --> 00:47:02.170
We really felt what
we were doing...


949
00:47:02.835 --> 00:47:04.842
you know, we knew
it was only porn.


950
00:47:05.381 --> 00:47:08.819
But we wanted to make it the
best porn we could possibly make it.


951
00:47:08.975 --> 00:47:12.627
"Justine" does qualify as one
of the better movies made, uh,


952
00:47:12.652 --> 00:47:15.489
uh, both in the history of porn,

953
00:47:15.514 --> 00:47:17.394
but in my personal
history working.


954
00:47:17.419 --> 00:47:19.913
It would be in my
top ten for sure.


955
00:47:20.242 --> 00:47:22.764
My crime was to share
these visions with you.


956
00:47:23.686 --> 00:47:24.764
The truth.

957
00:47:26.741 --> 00:47:29.655
And for this, I have been
judge unfit to walk among you.


958
00:47:30.439 --> 00:47:33.491
"Latex" was very
inexpensive to shoot.


959
00:47:33.706 --> 00:47:36.202
but then there was
about 12 months of post


960
00:47:36.358 --> 00:47:40.319
making all of this stuff, so that
might've the most expensive.


961
00:47:40.344 --> 00:47:43.747
This is a whole movie full of
computer-generated effects.


962
00:47:43.772 --> 00:47:46.786
This was so far before anybody
ever thought to do anything like


963
00:47:46.811 --> 00:47:48.686
that for porno, you know?

964
00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.753
Everybody who worked
on a Michael Ninn feature


965
00:47:50.777 --> 00:47:52.653
knew they were in for a ride.

966
00:47:52.678 --> 00:47:54.784
This is something that
you're not gonna walk in


967
00:47:54.808 --> 00:47:56.467
and be out of there in an hour.

968
00:47:56.764 --> 00:47:58.185
Uh, more often than not,

969
00:47:58.358 --> 00:48:01.710
it might take you a couple of
hours just to get your makeup on.


970
00:48:01.735 --> 00:48:05.835
He says that you claimed to
be able to "See inside of people."


971
00:48:06.131 --> 00:48:07.002
Did you say that?

972
00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:08.592
Yes.

973
00:48:10.336 --> 00:48:12.069
I'd call that E.S.P.,
wouldn't you?


974
00:48:13.014 --> 00:48:14.913
I would call it seeing
inside of people.


975
00:48:15.441 --> 00:48:18.793
Jon Dough really took hold of
that role and created that role


976
00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:20.217
almost on his own.

977
00:48:20.545 --> 00:48:24.357
Um, Michael Ninn made it
into a great movie by making it


978
00:48:24.381 --> 00:48:27.442
a visually powerful movie
and technically far superior than


979
00:48:27.467 --> 00:48:29.483
most everything else that
had been made before that.


980
00:48:30.092 --> 00:48:34.506
You're asking me to explain something
that I don't really understand myself.


981
00:48:34.585 --> 00:48:37.627
He was so deeply dedicated to

982
00:48:37.627 --> 00:48:38.810
what was going in there,

983
00:48:38.835 --> 00:48:41.147
more than I ever
saw him in any movie.


984
00:48:41.288 --> 00:48:43.592
There was one
set, the kitchen set


985
00:48:44.238 --> 00:48:46.092
with Zack and sunset Thomas.

986
00:48:46.499 --> 00:48:48.227
That's the only set we shot on.

987
00:48:48.252 --> 00:48:50.419
Everything else was
shot against green screen,


988
00:48:50.444 --> 00:48:52.817
which means everything
else in the movie


989
00:48:52.842 --> 00:48:54.585
had to be manufactured
after the shoot.


990
00:48:54.712 --> 00:48:56.388
I'm in the kitchen, you know,

991
00:48:56.413 --> 00:48:57.663
latex gloves on.

992
00:48:57.881 --> 00:49:00.725
And there's these big, white
panties they want you to wear.


993
00:49:00.858 --> 00:49:02.935
And I was in the dressing
room. I was just all upset


994
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.668
because I was so used wearing
these little skimpy underwear.


995
00:49:05.983 --> 00:49:08.185
I said, "Mike, I cannot wear
these granny underwear."


996
00:49:12.272 --> 00:49:14.685
Michael Ninn seems
to deal more with, um,


997
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:17.630
broad symbolism,
like, symbolic stories.


998
00:49:17.655 --> 00:49:20.006
They were huge
stories that talked about


999
00:49:20.178 --> 00:49:21.732
basically good and evil.

1000
00:49:21.756 --> 00:49:25.374
There's always the
innocent that gets corrupted.


1001
00:49:25.399 --> 00:49:28.127
There's the, the society that

1002
00:49:28.152 --> 00:49:29.585
churns up the innocents in its

1003
00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:32.394
gears, it's... it's
very symbolic


1004
00:49:32.419 --> 00:49:33.784
and broad in its scope,

1005
00:49:33.808 --> 00:49:36.747
and I think Andrew Blake
was more about instances.


1006
00:49:36.772 --> 00:49:39.405
Home video became such a
popular format for porn that,


1007
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:43.233
by the mid-90's, adult theaters
were essentially a thing of the past.


1008
00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:46.811
Producers traded New York
and San Francisco for sunny L.A.,


1009
00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.067
and the San Fernando valley
became the undisputed capital


1010
00:49:50.092 --> 00:49:51.436
of the adult business.

1011
00:49:51.858 --> 00:49:55.514
VHS and the industry seemed like
a marriage that would last forever.


1012
00:49:55.861 --> 00:49:57.592
But progress never stands still.

1013
00:49:57.835 --> 00:49:59.772
And a powerful new
format was about to bring


1014
00:49:59.797 --> 00:50:02.686
new options and new
challenges to porn valley.


1015
00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.585
Why are you going
through my purse?


1016
00:50:05.336 --> 00:50:08.818
To find your badge
and your fireman I.D.


1017
00:50:08.843 --> 00:50:11.333
You're the kind of girl
who takes out personal ads.


1018
00:50:11.492 --> 00:50:14.937
"Oh, hot-blooded
blonde need fireman!"


1019
00:50:15.125 --> 00:50:17.029
It was shortly
after "Backdraft,"


1020
00:50:17.054 --> 00:50:19.826
that big fireman movie
that everybody knew about.


1021
00:50:19.851 --> 00:50:21.137
And when it came
to "Flashpoint,"


1022
00:50:21.161 --> 00:50:23.601
what we were trying to do is we

1023
00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.359
had kind of started to
elevate our adult movies


1024
00:50:26.384 --> 00:50:28.418
into what we
thought could actually


1025
00:50:28.442 --> 00:50:29.773
if we cut the sex out of them,

1026
00:50:30.121 --> 00:50:32.671
become kind of like
that "B" movie vibe.


1027
00:50:33.601 --> 00:50:35.601
I just wish I had
another chance.


1028
00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:39.437
It had a storyline.

1029
00:50:39.601 --> 00:50:41.127
And it had real acting.

1030
00:50:41.391 --> 00:50:44.273
And it had... and
it had hot sex.


1031
00:50:44.648 --> 00:50:46.831
For its time, it
was a huge movie,


1032
00:50:46.856 --> 00:50:49.457
and, uh, as luck would have it,

1033
00:50:49.481 --> 00:50:51.125
I just happened to meet

1034
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:54.211
a big pyrotechnics guy who
worked in the mainstream.


1035
00:50:54.236 --> 00:50:56.351
They actually
worked on "Backdraft."


1036
00:50:56.742 --> 00:50:58.418
When working
with fire, of course,


1037
00:50:58.442 --> 00:51:01.975
there's always a huge
amount of safety precautions


1038
00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.295
and especially with the
mainstream guy doing it all,


1039
00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:06.139
you know, we had safety
meetings all the time.


1040
00:51:06.164 --> 00:51:08.402
At the time, I didn't
really think about


1041
00:51:08.426 --> 00:51:10.789
how hard it is to
be a firefighter.


1042
00:51:11.859 --> 00:51:15.242
So they had me carrying
dummies upstairs.


1043
00:51:15.601 --> 00:51:17.600
I think a couple of people
started thinking they were gonna


1044
00:51:17.625 --> 00:51:20.336
pass out running up and
down stairs with all the gear on.


1045
00:51:20.867 --> 00:51:23.414
Stevens, what do
you think you're doing?


1046
00:51:23.593 --> 00:51:24.077
Shh!

1047
00:51:25.054 --> 00:51:27.287
If the captain catches
you, your ass is history.


1048
00:51:27.312 --> 00:51:30.389
I didn't really
realize how incredibly


1049
00:51:30.414 --> 00:51:33.132
real this was going to be.

1050
00:51:33.157 --> 00:51:37.328
When you're having
sex behind fire,


1051
00:51:37.796 --> 00:51:39.804
you don't really realize

1052
00:51:40.419 --> 00:51:42.921
the fear that you're
gonna be feeling.


1053
00:51:43.187 --> 00:51:46.039
We really only had
one huge fire day,


1054
00:51:46.359 --> 00:51:48.678
and he had a huge crew

1055
00:51:48.703 --> 00:51:49.835
in there to make sure everybody

1056
00:51:49.835 --> 00:51:51.169
knew what they were doing.

1057
00:51:51.468 --> 00:51:54.035
And really had a grasp on

1058
00:51:54.367 --> 00:51:56.607
what the issues were
when it came to safety


1059
00:51:56.631 --> 00:52:00.594
and any, uh... and keeping
the actors out of danger.


1060
00:52:00.619 --> 00:52:03.127
I really think that we...

1061
00:52:03.127 --> 00:52:06.094
we accomplished
something really beautiful


1062
00:52:06.119 --> 00:52:08.288
and something groundbreaking.

1063
00:52:08.313 --> 00:52:09.439
To be honest with you,

1064
00:52:10.502 --> 00:52:12.619
I didn't exactly inherit
my father's sin...


1065
00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.705
I stole it.

1066
00:52:18.931 --> 00:52:20.619
It was not a high-budget movie.

1067
00:52:20.799 --> 00:52:22.750
We shot two movies on film

1068
00:52:22.775 --> 00:52:25.477
over five days for 70 grand.

1069
00:52:26.009 --> 00:52:29.025
So 2-1/2 days, $35,000...

1070
00:52:29.345 --> 00:52:30.594
It's nothing for film.

1071
00:52:30.619 --> 00:52:33.189
To me, it was a big deal because
this was another one... you know,


1072
00:52:33.452 --> 00:52:34.891
the films were here and there,

1073
00:52:34.916 --> 00:52:36.619
just few and far
between at that point.


1074
00:52:36.767 --> 00:52:39.423
Didn't you apply at the sheriff's
office in council bluffs or something?


1075
00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:41.423
Yeah, I got accepted, too,
but I'm not ready to leave yet.


1076
00:52:41.448 --> 00:52:44.703
The actors that came on
really took it seriously and really,


1077
00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:47.060
you know, I got good
people with acting chops.


1078
00:52:47.085 --> 00:52:48.095
Shanna McCullough

1079
00:52:48.573 --> 00:52:51.572
who, you know, later won
an award for it for best actress.


1080
00:52:51.597 --> 00:52:54.181
This was a film noir and
it was a detective story


1081
00:52:54.345 --> 00:52:56.102
and he wanted me to star in it.

1082
00:52:56.127 --> 00:52:58.322
It's a story of two detectives

1083
00:52:58.752 --> 00:53:02.320
and this woman who's
a femme fatale killer.


1084
00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:05.486
And she's, you know, seducing
men and then killing them.


1085
00:53:05.511 --> 00:53:08.436
And she's been
stalking my partner.


1086
00:53:08.461 --> 00:53:11.900
Apparently, his father dealt
with this also femme fatale


1087
00:53:12.212 --> 00:53:13.798
in his career as a policeman.

1088
00:53:13.923 --> 00:53:16.256
And he thinks it's
the same woman


1089
00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.219
and she's still
around after 50 years.


1090
00:53:18.244 --> 00:53:19.805
And I said, "No, it
must be her daughter."


1091
00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.974
The look of
"Looker" is very gritty


1092
00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:24.595
and noir inspired
and this is no accident.


1093
00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.455
I wanted to do a movie that

1094
00:53:26.869 --> 00:53:29.359
could've been shot in the 30s.

1095
00:53:29.384 --> 00:53:30.560
He was a real slave driver.

1096
00:53:30.585 --> 00:53:31.734
He literally would work

1097
00:53:31.759 --> 00:53:33.865
a 24-hour day if that
was what was necessary


1098
00:53:33.889 --> 00:53:35.391
because he was a perfectionist

1099
00:53:35.416 --> 00:53:36.781
and he wanted
everybody else to be.


1100
00:53:36.806 --> 00:53:39.937
When we shot that movie, we
knew we had something special.


1101
00:53:39.962 --> 00:53:41.587
We put a lot of
heart into it and Nic


1102
00:53:41.612 --> 00:53:43.572
put a lot of heart into it, and

1103
00:53:43.905 --> 00:53:46.837
we didn't get an opportunity
to do that much anymore so


1104
00:53:46.998 --> 00:53:49.734
it really felt good that it
was recognized for what


1105
00:53:49.759 --> 00:53:51.768
we really wanted it to be.

1106
00:53:51.793 --> 00:53:54.345
Early on in the show,
Shanna won for best actress.


1107
00:53:54.775 --> 00:53:57.697
And we were looking at each
other like, "Could this be?"


1108
00:53:58.336 --> 00:54:00.662
And then just the
floodgates just opened up


1109
00:54:00.686 --> 00:54:03.720
and we won best film
director for me, best film,


1110
00:54:04.291 --> 00:54:07.445
art direction, script, editing.

1111
00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:09.181
I mean, trifecta, sweep.

1112
00:54:09.642 --> 00:54:12.056
So it was one of the
better nights of my life.


1113
00:54:12.358 --> 00:54:13.149
Dogs lick.

1114
00:54:14.369 --> 00:54:16.134
Men fucking eat pussy.

1115
00:54:16.791 --> 00:54:18.033
Eat my pussy.

1116
00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:22.625
"Seven Deadly Sins" was
the obvious candidate for


1117
00:54:22.650 --> 00:54:23.812
the vignette style of shooting.

1118
00:54:23.837 --> 00:54:26.447
I wanted to be able to
have everything distinctly,


1119
00:54:27.767 --> 00:54:30.102
uh, represented
by the sin itself.


1120
00:54:30.806 --> 00:54:31.798
Where am I?

1121
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.125
You stupid bitch.

1122
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:38.959
The basic story
is a crisis of this


1123
00:54:39.408 --> 00:54:41.369
woman who's in love
with the real Janine.


1124
00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.970
And she's been told that

1125
00:54:44.072 --> 00:54:46.056
she actually kind of looks
like Janine, but of course,


1126
00:54:46.197 --> 00:54:48.095
we have a really
dowdy version of her.


1127
00:54:48.431 --> 00:54:52.212
So the challenge was, "How do
we make her have sex with herself?"


1128
00:54:52.384 --> 00:54:55.431
It was a stretch, you
know, it was, uh...


1129
00:54:57.557 --> 00:55:00.117
It's Julia, you know,
I was just kind of...


1130
00:55:00.142 --> 00:55:02.759
it's hard not to
just embrace her.


1131
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:06.252
So, uh, to take myself out of

1132
00:55:06.252 --> 00:55:08.664
that situation and be like,

1133
00:55:08.689 --> 00:55:10.571
"Yeah, it's me and it's me,"

1134
00:55:10.596 --> 00:55:12.845
that way, I'm not that
good of an actress.


1135
00:55:13.509 --> 00:55:15.961
You know, there were certain
things that we had to hide.


1136
00:55:15.986 --> 00:55:17.810
When you're trying to
shoot and be somebody,


1137
00:55:17.834 --> 00:55:20.916
and you can't show your face so you're
trying to turn and you're trying to...


1138
00:55:21.259 --> 00:55:22.234
it wasn't easy.

1139
00:55:22.259 --> 00:55:23.455
That I can tell you.

1140
00:55:24.322 --> 00:55:26.744
Your a whiny, dried-up

1141
00:55:27.330 --> 00:55:28.117
old maid.

1142
00:55:28.142 --> 00:55:29.283
Shut up!

1143
00:55:29.308 --> 00:55:30.384
That nobody wants.

1144
00:55:30.409 --> 00:55:31.220
Shut up.

1145
00:55:31.244 --> 00:55:32.197
That nobody likes.

1146
00:55:32.221 --> 00:55:33.650
There was a lot of food.

1147
00:55:33.877 --> 00:55:35.877
There was an abundance of...

1148
00:55:38.611 --> 00:55:39.424
chocolate.

1149
00:55:40.455 --> 00:55:42.541
It's a perfect scene if you're

1150
00:55:42.566 --> 00:55:45.814
a food fetish kind of guy.

1151
00:55:46.252 --> 00:55:49.697
We had to build
supports for these...


1152
00:55:50.194 --> 00:55:51.611
I think they were
ten-feet tall...


1153
00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.336
and we did an arc around that.

1154
00:55:53.572 --> 00:55:56.228
And then set that in a stage
that, at the time, I think was black.


1155
00:55:56.931 --> 00:55:58.102
So we could, you know...

1156
00:55:58.127 --> 00:55:59.865
and then we actually
got a turntable


1157
00:56:00.627 --> 00:56:02.818
for them to have sex
on so that could revolve,


1158
00:56:03.197 --> 00:56:05.297
so the image behind
in all the mirrors


1159
00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:06.759
was revolving at the same time.

1160
00:56:06.869 --> 00:56:09.263
It had a very, you
know, kind of a surreal


1161
00:56:09.287 --> 00:56:11.353
department store
window kinda feel to it.


1162
00:56:12.845 --> 00:56:14.556
Hey, watch the teeth, sweetie.

1163
00:56:16.587 --> 00:56:18.900
Sorry, force of habit.

1164
00:56:19.978 --> 00:56:24.227
"Dark Angels" came out... Scott
Taylor, the owner of New Sensations.


1165
00:56:24.252 --> 00:56:27.798
He goes, "I've always really kind
of liked horror movies and stuff and


1166
00:56:28.275 --> 00:56:29.806
Vampire-type stuff."

1167
00:56:29.831 --> 00:56:32.453
And I said, "Well, we
can do a vampire movie."


1168
00:56:32.478 --> 00:56:34.294
You looking for
something special tonight?


1169
00:56:35.469 --> 00:56:36.492
It depends, you a cop?

1170
00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:41.211
You see a badge, sweetheart?

1171
00:56:41.281 --> 00:56:43.895
When I conceived the whole story

1172
00:56:43.919 --> 00:56:46.379
and was writing the script
and everything, Mike Horner


1173
00:56:46.403 --> 00:56:48.727
was already cast in my head.

1174
00:56:48.752 --> 00:56:51.738
We had to spend more
time prepping and setting up


1175
00:56:51.945 --> 00:56:55.508
for the bleeding scene than
we did on the entire sex scene,


1176
00:56:55.648 --> 00:56:58.147
because it took several
hours for them to get it right.


1177
00:56:58.172 --> 00:57:00.008
They had to clean
the car one time


1178
00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:02.508
from all this blood...
all over the windows.


1179
00:57:02.835 --> 00:57:04.562
It just didn't work for
a variety of reasons.


1180
00:57:04.897 --> 00:57:07.211
I was just getting to that.

1181
00:57:13.703 --> 00:57:17.148
We didn't get started doing
that scene until about midnight.


1182
00:57:17.492 --> 00:57:20.914
And we went till like 4:00 in
the morning, 5:00 in the morning.


1183
00:57:21.005 --> 00:57:23.586
We got out of there just
in time for the sunrise.


1184
00:57:23.611 --> 00:57:26.835
When I approached Sydnee
to do the movie, I said,


1185
00:57:27.453 --> 00:57:30.053
"All right, I don't know if you've
done something like this before,


1186
00:57:30.078 --> 00:57:31.785
we're gonna do, like,
you know, full-body


1187
00:57:31.809 --> 00:57:33.241
cast of you, prosthetics."

1188
00:57:33.266 --> 00:57:35.297
'Cause that's her in the
monster suit at the end.


1189
00:57:35.461 --> 00:57:38.328
And, you know, and you're gonna
be wearing contacts and all this.


1190
00:57:38.852 --> 00:57:41.297
And, you know, would
you commit to this?


1191
00:57:41.322 --> 00:57:42.437
She goes, "I'd love to."

1192
00:57:42.703 --> 00:57:44.367
And I'm looking around
the warehouse and thinking,


1193
00:57:44.392 --> 00:57:47.276
"Man, you know, I'm
working in this warehouse and,


1194
00:57:47.301 --> 00:57:49.091
you know, I'm a
vampire. This is my lair.


1195
00:57:49.364 --> 00:57:51.618
I never took the time to
take care of all these pallets


1196
00:57:51.642 --> 00:57:53.020
that lay here all over, broken."

1197
00:57:56.255 --> 00:57:57.786
"Ah, I'll never fall on that."

1198
00:57:58.002 --> 00:57:59.731
In the dumpster,
wouldn't you know it?


1199
00:58:00.377 --> 00:58:02.377
Pallet, right, right?

1200
00:58:02.402 --> 00:58:04.169
A pallet and broken glass.

1201
00:58:04.194 --> 00:58:07.485
Jewel De'Nyle was
the contract girl,


1202
00:58:07.942 --> 00:58:09.270
and she actually quit,

1203
00:58:09.426 --> 00:58:12.200
uh, five days before
we finished shooting.


1204
00:58:12.336 --> 00:58:13.653
She stormed off the set.

1205
00:58:13.678 --> 00:58:15.769
It's actually on the
behind-the-scenes.


1206
00:58:15.794 --> 00:58:17.911
Fortunately, I had
shot the end already.


1207
00:58:18.098 --> 00:58:22.019
It broke a lot of rules
when it came out.


1208
00:58:22.044 --> 00:58:24.298
It upset some people,
it excited a lot of people,


1209
00:58:24.322 --> 00:58:26.378
it made a lot of
money, you know?


1210
00:58:26.403 --> 00:58:27.907
It was... it was one of those

1211
00:58:27.931 --> 00:58:31.192
great experiences that I
was never able to duplicate,


1212
00:58:31.217 --> 00:58:35.323
even with bigger budgets, bigger
crews, newer equipment, everything.


1213
00:58:35.348 --> 00:58:37.966
I was never able
to capture the magic


1214
00:58:38.536 --> 00:58:39.862
that went into
making that movie.


1215
00:58:39.887 --> 00:58:41.536
You tried to get my attention.

1216
00:58:41.841 --> 00:58:42.669
Yes.

1217
00:58:43.145 --> 00:58:44.585
Well, you did.

1218
00:58:44.903 --> 00:58:47.059
I was very impressed
by your DVD.


1219
00:58:47.341 --> 00:58:50.247
Really? Anything else
impress you here tonight?


1220
00:58:51.098 --> 00:58:53.532
I thought I had a good
movie because, uh,


1221
00:58:53.966 --> 00:58:57.477
the script was the best script that
I thought I had ever come up with,


1222
00:58:57.809 --> 00:59:00.495
in terms of interesting ideas.
It took a long time to write it.


1223
00:59:07.866 --> 00:59:11.044
To be directed by John,
especially for this movie,


1224
00:59:11.044 --> 00:59:14.466
was so special for me
because I started as a fan.


1225
00:59:14.491 --> 00:59:16.810
I was a big fan of all
the "Buttman" series.


1226
00:59:16.835 --> 00:59:18.553
I was a big fan of John, so

1227
00:59:18.855 --> 00:59:21.786
it was like being in a dream.

1228
00:59:21.811 --> 00:59:24.052
I had a good meeting
with my cinematographer


1229
00:59:24.077 --> 00:59:26.919
who said, "Well, what's the
relationship between those two girls?"


1230
00:59:26.919 --> 00:59:28.100
And I said, "Oh.

1231
00:59:28.686 --> 00:59:30.019
They could have a relationship."

1232
00:59:30.044 --> 00:59:31.669
That's more than just the girl

1233
00:59:31.694 --> 00:59:33.389
in the back room
trying to seduce Rocco.


1234
00:59:33.483 --> 00:59:35.455
My English at that time was

1235
00:59:35.689 --> 00:59:38.877
horrible, like,
barely any English.


1236
00:59:38.986 --> 00:59:41.000
Rocco speaks French very well

1237
00:59:41.025 --> 00:59:43.189
so he would translate
some of the things, but


1238
00:59:43.517 --> 00:59:46.734
the funniest part was...
was the dialogue I had,


1239
00:59:46.759 --> 00:59:49.627
I was basically doing
it... doing it... phonetically.


1240
00:59:49.806 --> 00:59:52.294
I told you they are
still in the dark ages.


1241
00:59:52.319 --> 00:59:55.884
I'm already not a
great actor to start with,


1242
00:59:56.447 --> 01:00:00.075
but here, it was like...
like robotic acting.


1243
01:00:06.504 --> 01:00:08.667
I'll do this thing about
this little fashion company


1244
01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:11.456
'cause I wanna do stuff with
fashion 'cause I like clothes


1245
01:00:11.481 --> 01:00:13.860
and sexy clothes on girls.
It gives me an excuse,


1246
01:00:13.884 --> 01:00:16.286
and I'll have this little mousey
girl sitting in the corner and


1247
01:00:16.311 --> 01:00:18.543
she'll just... she'll really be
the brains behind the operation.


1248
01:00:18.887 --> 01:00:22.668
And we'll do this like normal,
like TV show kind of thing.


1249
01:00:22.961 --> 01:00:25.465
But that morphed into

1250
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.293
a fetish fashion company and the

1251
01:00:28.317 --> 01:00:30.843
girl sitting in the corner
was belladonna who


1252
01:00:31.067 --> 01:00:35.910
sends the guy she's trying to
seduce an extreme S&M DVD


1253
01:00:35.934 --> 01:00:39.084
where he finds this stuff
with easter eggs on the DVD.


1254
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:43.217
It morphed into something that
was really like a primer for S&M sex.


1255
01:00:43.242 --> 01:00:45.789
Whereas, it was supposed to
be this middle-of-the-road thing,


1256
01:00:46.023 --> 01:00:48.968
because I can't think
middle-of-the-road somehow.


1257
01:00:49.289 --> 01:00:52.514
305 rolls of film as I recall.

1258
01:00:52.539 --> 01:00:54.426
And most of those
were the four minutes,


1259
01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:56.597
although, we did have
on two different days,


1260
01:00:56.621 --> 01:00:59.264
we had the big camera which
could shoot 11 minutes at a time


1261
01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:00.789
which was so great, 11 minutes.

1262
01:01:01.101 --> 01:01:03.919
I don't think I've done my
best movie yet, that's for sure.


1263
01:01:03.919 --> 01:01:06.726
I hope to be doing my next movie
is gonna be my best movie, always.


1264
01:01:06.945 --> 01:01:08.242
what can I do for you today?

1265
01:01:09.195 --> 01:01:10.250
I'd like a massage.

1266
01:01:10.554 --> 01:01:12.640
Well, you've certainly
come to the right place.


1267
01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:19.492
I made the original "Masseuse" in
about 1990 or something like that.


1268
01:01:19.859 --> 01:01:25.046
And it was really a
departure for X-rated movies.


1269
01:01:28.343 --> 01:01:29.461
Hello, this is Jim.

1270
01:01:30.539 --> 01:01:32.928
I think it is the best
movie I've made.


1271
01:01:33.351 --> 01:01:38.562
I felt so incredibly
comfortable with the script,


1272
01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:40.841
and I'd seen the movie prior.

1273
01:01:40.937 --> 01:01:43.189
The directness, the simplicity,

1274
01:01:43.213 --> 01:01:44.731
the truthfulness of it.

1275
01:01:44.756 --> 01:01:46.505
There's no bells and whistles.

1276
01:01:47.067 --> 01:01:50.255
It's just a masseuse
and her client talking.


1277
01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:54.685
You know, what did I call it... "My
Dinner With Andre" of X-rated movies.


1278
01:01:54.856 --> 01:01:58.536
If you watch the movie
closely, you can almost see me,


1279
01:01:59.497 --> 01:02:00.567
the real me,

1280
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:02.341
discovering myself.

1281
01:02:03.888 --> 01:02:05.585
So that's why I like it so much.

1282
01:02:06.755 --> 01:02:07.606
How old are you?

1283
01:02:08.286 --> 01:02:08.810
28.

1284
01:02:09.763 --> 01:02:10.614
Girlfriend?

1285
01:02:14.216 --> 01:02:15.458
Can I tell you a secret?

1286
01:02:16.067 --> 01:02:17.692
Sure, I love secrets.

1287
01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:23.567
I'm a virgin.

1288
01:02:25.177 --> 01:02:29.419
I like to stab and
see how far I can go.


1289
01:02:29.505 --> 01:02:31.739
Paul Thomas has a way about him,

1290
01:02:32.505 --> 01:02:36.552
and I think I gained a
little bit of his respect.


1291
01:02:36.622 --> 01:02:39.025
He's used to being
able to tell people


1292
01:02:39.049 --> 01:02:40.668
pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.

1293
01:02:40.693 --> 01:02:41.954
And I would be like,

1294
01:02:41.978 --> 01:02:44.911
"Listen, no, this is
the way this should be,


1295
01:02:44.936 --> 01:02:46.638
and this is the
way this should be.


1296
01:02:46.663 --> 01:02:48.231
What do you think about that?"

1297
01:02:48.427 --> 01:02:50.793
She brought a lot to the
table, she listened to me,


1298
01:02:51.060 --> 01:02:54.013
always on time... I'm the one
who had to step up my game.


1299
01:02:54.825 --> 01:02:58.552
You know, with Jenna,
no partying, you know?


1300
01:02:59.279 --> 01:03:00.161
Be there.

1301
01:03:01.333 --> 01:03:02.966
I'll see you later, then

1302
01:03:03.966 --> 01:03:04.998
Justine.

1303
01:03:09.638 --> 01:03:11.544
I played Justine Jones,

1304
01:03:12.817 --> 01:03:14.071
in "The New Devil
In Miss Jones,"


1305
01:03:14.095 --> 01:03:16.083
and Jenna Jameson
played the devil,


1306
01:03:16.349 --> 01:03:18.333
which was quite interesting
because I got the script


1307
01:03:18.794 --> 01:03:22.325
and then heard that Jenna
wanted to play the devil


1308
01:03:22.491 --> 01:03:24.942
and my... my first thought was

1309
01:03:25.005 --> 01:03:26.186
not only do you have to remake

1310
01:03:26.211 --> 01:03:28.449
this amazing classic film,

1311
01:03:28.474 --> 01:03:30.419
"The Devil and Miss
Jones," but also now


1312
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.878
next to Jenna Jameson
who wants to play the devil.


1313
01:03:33.903 --> 01:03:38.106
At first it feels like a
no-win situation, you know?


1314
01:03:38.325 --> 01:03:40.911
What am I gonna
make "Exorcist 2" here?


1315
01:03:41.927 --> 01:03:44.075
Once in a while, you
get "Godfather Two,"


1316
01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:47.400
but most of the time, the
sequel's just aren't so good


1317
01:03:47.424 --> 01:03:48.542
if the original's pretty good.

1318
01:03:48.567 --> 01:03:51.002
I had been out of the
business for a long time.


1319
01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:53.474
And Paul Thomas called
me one night and said,


1320
01:03:53.499 --> 01:03:55.711
"We're gonna do a remake
of 'The Devil and Miss Jones'


1321
01:03:55.736 --> 01:03:59.032
and I said, "Well, very good,
Paul, congratulations, good luck,"


1322
01:03:59.056 --> 01:04:01.345
and so forth. And he says,
"You're gonna be in it,"


1323
01:04:01.369 --> 01:04:02.583
and I said, "Oh, no, I'm not."

1324
01:04:03.325 --> 01:04:04.683
And he said, "Oh,
yes, you are." He says,


1325
01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:07.199
"You're just gonna do
a cameo, three lines."


1326
01:04:07.224 --> 01:04:09.102
I said, "I don't even
wanna learn three lines."


1327
01:04:09.127 --> 01:04:11.630
He says, "I'll give you
$10,000," I said, "Okay."


1328
01:04:12.752 --> 01:04:14.853
When she comes out
at the end of that movie,


1329
01:04:14.877 --> 01:04:18.286
you get chills. Especially
if you know who she is.


1330
01:04:18.567 --> 01:04:20.161
It really works, and, uh...

1331
01:04:21.044 --> 01:04:22.458
She's just delightful.

1332
01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.044
Do you read, miss Jones?

1333
01:04:24.645 --> 01:04:26.981
Only romance
novels, it's my job.


1334
01:04:28.341 --> 01:04:30.668
You are so privileged.

1335
01:04:30.927 --> 01:04:33.380
And you feel so
sorry for yourself.


1336
01:04:34.466 --> 01:04:37.122
I think Georgina Spelvin is

1337
01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.841
one of the most
groundbreaking women ever.


1338
01:04:43.357 --> 01:04:46.075
A woman that's capable of

1339
01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:47.919
owning her sexuality

1340
01:04:48.106 --> 01:04:50.845
and not backing down

1341
01:04:50.869 --> 01:04:54.252
at the time when she
was fame... uber famous.


1342
01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:57.224
I have ultimate respect for her,

1343
01:04:57.614 --> 01:05:00.247
and I made sure I told her that.

1344
01:05:00.425 --> 01:05:03.253
And her acting
was fantastic, too.


1345
01:05:03.614 --> 01:05:06.618
It was really cool
to do that three way


1346
01:05:06.642 --> 01:05:09.599
with Savanna and Jenna
because, you know, at the time,


1347
01:05:10.099 --> 01:05:13.247
we were three of the biggest
names in the business, and it was like,


1348
01:05:13.361 --> 01:05:14.919
"Wow, this is gonna be epic."

1349
01:05:15.187 --> 01:05:17.544
While I'm getting
DP'd, I say this


1350
01:05:18.064 --> 01:05:21.152
monologue from... that Georgina
Spelvin said in the original "Miss Jones."


1351
01:05:21.177 --> 01:05:23.627
If you touch me, I'll
come, I know I will.


1352
01:05:23.627 --> 01:05:25.425
Touch me, touch me, touch me.

1353
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:26.894
I'll make you come, too.

1354
01:05:26.919 --> 01:05:28.712
So when I did
Howard Stern, he said,


1355
01:05:28.736 --> 01:05:30.650
"Well, did you fuck a snake,"
because that's what people think


1356
01:05:30.674 --> 01:05:32.661
of the original Miss Jones.
They don't remember much,


1357
01:05:32.686 --> 01:05:34.458
but they remember
the snake scene.


1358
01:05:34.724 --> 01:05:36.478
And what they actually
remember about it,


1359
01:05:36.502 --> 01:05:39.355
but they think mostly that there
was a sex scene with a snake.


1360
01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:41.127
So I went to Vivid and I said,

1361
01:05:41.127 --> 01:05:42.878
"Look, we have to
do a snake scene."


1362
01:05:42.903 --> 01:05:46.252
It was a good time in
everyone's lives. They were tight.


1363
01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.269
Vivid was tight.

1364
01:05:48.294 --> 01:05:49.394
We were all tight and working...

1365
01:05:49.419 --> 01:05:51.126
really working

1366
01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:52.793
both for "The Devil
in Miss Jones" and


1367
01:05:52.793 --> 01:05:54.763
for "Masseuse", working at the

1368
01:05:54.966 --> 01:05:58.956
top of our professional
levels and our personal lives.


1369
01:05:58.981 --> 01:06:00.502
We're all pretty damn together.

1370
01:06:00.935 --> 01:06:02.458
So it was nothing but...

1371
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:03.856
nothing but positive.

1372
01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.778
The 2000s were the
decade when porn grew up.


1373
01:06:07.161 --> 01:06:09.071
Flush with money
from the DVD boom,


1374
01:06:09.095 --> 01:06:12.228
producers began shooting
bigger movies with major budgets,


1375
01:06:12.252 --> 01:06:14.668
gigantic casts, and
elaborate scripts.


1376
01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.398
These adult blockbusters

1377
01:06:16.423 --> 01:06:18.478
needed a better format
than simple video,


1378
01:06:18.502 --> 01:06:20.849
and film was becoming
too costly to justify.


1379
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:24.130
Coming with its own set of
technical issues and concerns,


1380
01:06:24.310 --> 01:06:27.700
the fast-growing HD format
provided that bigger canvas.


1381
01:06:27.725 --> 01:06:30.419
The features of that time, were people
spending a lot of money on them...


1382
01:06:30.419 --> 01:06:30.927
Yeah.

1383
01:06:30.952 --> 01:06:32.074
When it was new, were they...

1384
01:06:32.099 --> 01:06:35.228
Yeah, I mean, like,
I remember doing


1385
01:06:35.252 --> 01:06:38.714
one of my first feature
leads was for "Wicked."


1386
01:06:38.739 --> 01:06:41.960
It was this really big,
like, Michael Raven movie.


1387
01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.685
I remember it had, like, these

1388
01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:46.894
oozing, like, tentacle dildos

1389
01:06:46.919 --> 01:06:50.433
and fog machine,
and, like, these big sets


1390
01:06:50.458 --> 01:06:53.087
and it was the first time, you
know, we shot out in the desert


1391
01:06:53.111 --> 01:06:55.536
and it was, like, a wind
storm and it was just...


1392
01:06:55.838 --> 01:06:57.091
it was awesome.

1393
01:06:57.116 --> 01:06:59.470
It was, like, really
fun to go from, like,


1394
01:06:59.494 --> 01:07:01.831
just getting, like, you know...

1395
01:07:01.856 --> 01:07:02.591
Nailed.

1396
01:07:02.778 --> 01:07:05.847
Fuck-nailed on a Gonzo set,

1397
01:07:05.872 --> 01:07:06.915
just pounded, like,

1398
01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:09.252
"Yeah, motherfucker, come
on, I can take it," you know,


1399
01:07:09.481 --> 01:07:11.627
to, like, catering.

1400
01:07:12.614 --> 01:07:14.835
You know, like, "Would
you like a snack?"


1401
01:07:15.013 --> 01:07:15.536
"Yes, I would."

1402
01:07:15.561 --> 01:07:16.552
There's breakfast on set?

1403
01:07:16.739 --> 01:07:18.396
"Oh I would like a snack."

1404
01:07:18.724 --> 01:07:21.833
So how has Internet
affected the industry today?


1405
01:07:22.153 --> 01:07:25.603
I think it makes the fans crazy

1406
01:07:25.627 --> 01:07:27.946
because it's so easy to access

1407
01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:29.302
your favorite stars and

1408
01:07:29.505 --> 01:07:32.020
have conversations
and give them gifts and,


1409
01:07:32.224 --> 01:07:35.211
you know, just to talk to
whoever you're a fan of.


1410
01:07:35.236 --> 01:07:37.739
So the Internet,
literally, they can see


1411
01:07:38.017 --> 01:07:40.384
who's shooting when, that day,

1412
01:07:40.408 --> 01:07:41.769
they know when
it's gonna come out.


1413
01:07:41.794 --> 01:07:44.286
It's just, like, right now,
everything's so fast.


1414
01:07:45.036 --> 01:07:46.599
I'm looking for a pirate.

1415
01:07:47.575 --> 01:07:50.419
We know many, many pirates.

1416
01:07:51.153 --> 01:07:53.903
By far, the biggest production
that I've ever been involved in


1417
01:07:53.928 --> 01:07:55.127
had to be the "Pirates."

1418
01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:57.986
Shot stuff in L.A., then
took the whole troop,


1419
01:07:58.010 --> 01:07:59.628
crew, everybody
that was involved in it


1420
01:07:59.653 --> 01:08:01.903
all the way to Florida. We
shot on the U.S.S. Bounty.


1421
01:08:02.013 --> 01:08:03.278
It took three weeks
to shoot the movie.


1422
01:08:03.644 --> 01:08:05.435
Helmsman, prepare to set sail.

1423
01:08:05.614 --> 01:08:08.247
Are you really gonna
let her go unscathed, sir?


1424
01:08:08.669 --> 01:08:09.960
Of course not.

1425
01:08:10.615 --> 01:08:11.544
Sink her.

1426
01:08:17.763 --> 01:08:18.895
Working with Joone,

1427
01:08:19.059 --> 01:08:20.668
he has a vision,

1428
01:08:20.668 --> 01:08:21.653
he's an artist.

1429
01:08:21.817 --> 01:08:23.599
He has this great
vision of something


1430
01:08:23.624 --> 01:08:25.701
bigger than what porn is.

1431
01:08:25.726 --> 01:08:27.497
There's some
directors that actually


1432
01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:30.384
get involved in their stuff, they
have the vision in their head,


1433
01:08:30.408 --> 01:08:31.661
and joone is one
of those directors.


1434
01:08:31.686 --> 01:08:33.501
He already had
the set in his head


1435
01:08:33.525 --> 01:08:35.627
and they built it and
they took their time to do it


1436
01:08:35.652 --> 01:08:37.005
and he knew exactly
what he wanted.


1437
01:08:37.168 --> 01:08:38.575
Already had the
shots in his head.


1438
01:08:38.794 --> 01:08:40.934
It's a bit slow
tonight, it's awkward.


1439
01:08:41.263 --> 01:08:42.543
Line up the crew on the bow.

1440
01:08:42.724 --> 01:08:44.627
Bring me the passengers
from the deck below.


1441
01:08:44.652 --> 01:08:45.442
And, Serena,

1442
01:08:46.496 --> 01:08:47.794
as much as I love your methods,

1443
01:08:47.819 --> 01:08:48.839
don't even consider

1444
01:08:48.864 --> 01:08:49.894
killing anyone this time.

1445
01:08:49.919 --> 01:08:52.708
I don't think I was
ever a cruel pirate.


1446
01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.532
I'm gonna have to
watch that again...


1447
01:08:54.556 --> 01:08:55.958
uh, was I a cruel...

1448
01:08:55.983 --> 01:08:57.927
was Serena a cruel pirate?

1449
01:08:58.442 --> 01:09:00.019
She was a horny pirate.

1450
01:09:00.325 --> 01:09:01.643
I don't know if she was cruel.

1451
01:09:01.668 --> 01:09:04.442
Well, there's the
vicious lady I remember.


1452
01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:06.692
Don't ever second-guess me.

1453
01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:08.669
He built the tension.

1454
01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:11.081
So we were, of course,
the last scene of "Pirates."


1455
01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:14.002
He just waited, and they
would say little things to us to like


1456
01:09:14.027 --> 01:09:16.477
get us ready and
turned-on and ready to go.


1457
01:09:16.502 --> 01:09:20.542
They kept Jesse Jane and
I separate, uh, separated


1458
01:09:21.247 --> 01:09:23.915
just so the tension and the,

1459
01:09:23.939 --> 01:09:27.161
you know, the anticipation
would build up and...


1460
01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:28.449
And he's come tease me.

1461
01:09:28.474 --> 01:09:29.511
"I wonder who's gonna win?

1462
01:09:29.536 --> 01:09:31.052
I guess she's gonna show you."

1463
01:09:31.169 --> 01:09:33.689
She's about half my
size and this little...


1464
01:09:33.713 --> 01:09:36.761
this little cupcake
thought she was gonna...


1465
01:09:36.786 --> 01:09:37.895
Dominate me?

1466
01:09:38.192 --> 01:09:40.454
I had to... I had to
put her in her place,


1467
01:09:40.478 --> 01:09:42.708
but I let her pretend to
think that for a little bit.


1468
01:09:42.733 --> 01:09:44.863
Okay, so Carmen gets put...

1469
01:09:44.888 --> 01:09:47.067
choked off the boat
by Tommy Gunn.


1470
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:50.474
And they wanted to
do this stunt where, uh,


1471
01:09:50.830 --> 01:09:52.839
stunt girl goes off in
the water, no big deal.


1472
01:09:52.864 --> 01:09:54.200
And she goes, "No."

1473
01:09:54.225 --> 01:09:56.919
Well, Jesse wouldn't
have nothing to do with that.


1474
01:09:56.944 --> 01:09:58.333
She wanted to do
the stunt herself.


1475
01:09:58.419 --> 01:10:00.200
And of course, I'm a
daredevil, so I'm like,


1476
01:10:00.567 --> 01:10:01.700
"I'll do it."

1477
01:10:01.841 --> 01:10:03.977
And I know what's gonna
happen before it even happens.


1478
01:10:04.002 --> 01:10:05.652
So I already got my stuff
off, got my boots off, and


1479
01:10:05.677 --> 01:10:07.377
I'm just standing here and
just waiting for her to jump in.


1480
01:10:07.497 --> 01:10:09.915
As soon as she jump in and
they got the shot and the splash,


1481
01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:11.211
I'm in the water after her.

1482
01:10:11.388 --> 01:10:13.880
They're not even thinking
that this big, ballooning dress


1483
01:10:13.905 --> 01:10:15.355
is just gonna suck
up right to her,


1484
01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:16.253
and she's not
gonna be able to kick,


1485
01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:17.536
she's not gonna be
able to do anything.


1486
01:10:17.561 --> 01:10:19.402
Well, my dress, her dress,

1487
01:10:19.427 --> 01:10:21.769
gets caught on a nail
underneath the boat


1488
01:10:21.794 --> 01:10:24.169
and I start sinking
and I can't come up.


1489
01:10:24.427 --> 01:10:27.419
But she went in and
she almost drowned.


1490
01:10:27.552 --> 01:10:29.228
I think some of that
was behind-the-scenes,


1491
01:10:29.252 --> 01:10:30.535
not all of it where
I was drowning,


1492
01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.294
'cause that was
probably not good.


1493
01:10:32.319 --> 01:10:34.761
I definitely didn't
know it would be


1494
01:10:34.786 --> 01:10:36.173
as big as it was and

1495
01:10:36.197 --> 01:10:37.810
the number one movie ever.

1496
01:10:37.835 --> 01:10:39.627
And people who ever watched porn

1497
01:10:39.627 --> 01:10:41.252
heard of the movie
and went to watch it.


1498
01:10:41.927 --> 01:10:43.831
It was the first movie to be cut

1499
01:10:43.856 --> 01:10:45.035
into a rated R version and

1500
01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.738
rented in blockbuster.

1501
01:10:46.763 --> 01:10:48.252
It was a blockbuster hit.

1502
01:10:50.786 --> 01:10:52.075
You must think me a monster.

1503
01:10:55.029 --> 01:10:56.099
I am a monster.

1504
01:10:57.228 --> 01:10:59.388
"Corruption" was
probably the first


1505
01:10:59.413 --> 01:11:01.886
big-budget movie
that I had worked on


1506
01:11:01.911 --> 01:11:03.302
that I was that involved in.

1507
01:11:03.502 --> 01:11:05.060
I'd, you know, been in other

1508
01:11:05.085 --> 01:11:07.583
big-budget movies as talent,

1509
01:11:07.825 --> 01:11:09.544
but you're not as involved
when you're talent.


1510
01:11:09.569 --> 01:11:11.160
You show up and, you know,

1511
01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:13.716
you pretty much do your
thing and you're done.


1512
01:11:14.364 --> 01:11:17.169
It was something being
done and being done well


1513
01:11:17.903 --> 01:11:19.489
and with, like, heart.

1514
01:11:19.856 --> 01:11:23.311
So, that is the stuff
that, like, attracts me.


1515
01:11:24.435 --> 01:11:26.575
Yeah, I got you right
where you want me.


1516
01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:32.872
I also had a pretty
decent acting role.


1517
01:11:33.106 --> 01:11:35.810
And that was playing
the part of Carolyn helms,


1518
01:11:36.552 --> 01:11:39.770
who was the senator's wife.

1519
01:11:40.263 --> 01:11:43.849
And she's kind of the
central part of the movie.


1520
01:11:44.169 --> 01:11:47.650
Here's Carolyn in the middle,
and she's kind of starts manipulating


1521
01:11:47.674 --> 01:11:50.480
everybody to do what she wants.

1522
01:11:50.505 --> 01:11:52.802
I'm a union leader, a teamster.

1523
01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:56.231
And I'm a... I'm
trying to work, uh,


1524
01:11:56.787 --> 01:11:59.255
my political power to

1525
01:11:59.411 --> 01:12:01.005
to gain an advantage.

1526
01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:03.770
Word is you're planning a run
at the big ticket in two years.


1527
01:12:03.966 --> 01:12:06.880
If that's true, you're
gonna need money,


1528
01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.673
us, and god on your side...

1529
01:12:10.153 --> 01:12:11.042
in that order.

1530
01:12:11.067 --> 01:12:13.478
I'm being blackmailed
in this scene, so I’m...


1531
01:12:13.502 --> 01:12:16.269
so I'm doing... I'm
performing a sexual act


1532
01:12:16.294 --> 01:12:19.060
that if I get caught, my
own career would be done.


1533
01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:21.722
So I was... it was another
scene of humiliation for me,


1534
01:12:21.747 --> 01:12:23.864
which I’m comfortable
with in my own life


1535
01:12:24.177 --> 01:12:25.627
with two marriages behind me.

1536
01:12:25.841 --> 01:12:27.387
How many times did they
push me out of the car?


1537
01:12:27.411 --> 01:12:29.085
How many times did they
almost hit me with the car?


1538
01:12:29.263 --> 01:12:31.700
I think they were just having
fun throwing James out of a car.


1539
01:12:31.725 --> 01:12:33.692
I had to be like limp
and get thrown of this car,


1540
01:12:33.895 --> 01:12:35.436
um, onto a pile of garbage.

1541
01:12:35.461 --> 01:12:36.907
I think they must've
shot that scene.


1542
01:12:36.931 --> 01:12:38.855
For whatever
reason, like 15 times.


1543
01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:42.002
It felt like forever 'cause I'd been
pushed out of the car in to garbage.


1544
01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:44.048
And then there was
this one time where, uh,


1545
01:12:44.072 --> 01:12:46.269
my legs felt a little
weird and, like, everyone


1546
01:12:46.294 --> 01:12:48.935
started screaming 'cause the
car almost rolled over my ankle.


1547
01:12:49.247 --> 01:12:51.160
It was fun, it was fantastic

1548
01:12:51.185 --> 01:12:53.251
because we'd all
worked so hard on it and,


1549
01:12:53.275 --> 01:12:55.652
you know, we had this
sense of family and hard work,


1550
01:12:55.677 --> 01:12:57.536
and the movie just
looked incredible.


1551
01:12:57.724 --> 01:12:58.724
And then we won.

1552
01:12:58.974 --> 01:13:02.099
And I remember jumping up
when we won at the AVN awards


1553
01:13:02.124 --> 01:13:04.919
and I had a corset on and I was
so excited and I actually peed a little.


1554
01:13:05.859 --> 01:13:06.731
Wow.

1555
01:13:09.153 --> 01:13:11.583
That was the closest
thing to god I've ever felt.


1556
01:13:12.802 --> 01:13:13.388
Who is it?

1557
01:13:14.575 --> 01:13:16.621
I don't know, but it's...

1558
01:13:17.091 --> 01:13:19.435
It's a lot bigger and a
lot smarter than we are.


1559
01:13:20.286 --> 01:13:21.810
It was my first lead,

1560
01:13:21.835 --> 01:13:23.542
big feature film like that.

1561
01:13:23.567 --> 01:13:25.235
I had done the smaller ones

1562
01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.786
where I was like
supporting actress.


1563
01:13:26.811 --> 01:13:28.081
But this was like... it really

1564
01:13:28.106 --> 01:13:29.946
put me on the map as
far as the industry went.


1565
01:13:29.971 --> 01:13:30.989
My partner dies,

1566
01:13:31.458 --> 01:13:33.518
like, in the line of
duty. I'm devastated.


1567
01:13:33.543 --> 01:13:35.329
But I'm kind of
like a hard-ass, too,


1568
01:13:35.353 --> 01:13:37.627
and I don't let anybody
kind of see my emotions.


1569
01:13:37.652 --> 01:13:39.884
And we discover
this hacker girl,


1570
01:13:39.908 --> 01:13:42.419
which was played
by Hillary Scott.


1571
01:13:42.444 --> 01:13:45.793
At that point, sexy pictures had
just signed Hillary to under contract.


1572
01:13:46.106 --> 01:13:48.981
And they told us
we had to use her.


1573
01:13:49.085 --> 01:13:52.091
In the end, Hillary
did an amazing job.


1574
01:13:52.364 --> 01:13:55.462
She actually, you
know... She was prepared


1575
01:13:55.486 --> 01:13:58.870
and she came and
she worked really hard


1576
01:13:58.895 --> 01:14:00.089
and who am I kidding?

1577
01:14:00.114 --> 01:14:01.677
She did not work hard at all.

1578
01:14:02.013 --> 01:14:04.466
She didn't, I'm lying to try
to make her sound good.


1579
01:14:04.747 --> 01:14:08.144
Through the miracle of editing

1580
01:14:08.169 --> 01:14:10.191
and good acting coaching,

1581
01:14:10.216 --> 01:14:12.731
I think that she
filled the role fine.


1582
01:14:15.502 --> 01:14:17.224
David, I know you can hear me.

1583
01:14:17.622 --> 01:14:18.849
Showed up on set and I was like,

1584
01:14:18.874 --> 01:14:20.939
"Oh, this is a... this
is a big movie, isn't it?"


1585
01:14:20.963 --> 01:14:22.333
And they're like, "Yeah,
you're like the star of it."


1586
01:14:22.358 --> 01:14:24.252
I'm like, But I'm
only here for a day."


1587
01:14:24.277 --> 01:14:26.120
And they're like, "Well, all
right, you're not the star of it,


1588
01:14:26.145 --> 01:14:28.364
you're just... the whole
movie is about you."


1589
01:14:28.489 --> 01:14:30.269
You see a lot of movies
in porn where they say,


1590
01:14:30.294 --> 01:14:34.144
"We spend a million
dollars, we spend $2 million,"


1591
01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:35.509
whatever the case is.

1592
01:14:35.533 --> 01:14:37.199
And I'm going to tell you that

1593
01:14:37.224 --> 01:14:40.450
for the most part, they lie.

1594
01:14:40.568 --> 01:14:43.095
People will say, "We
spend all this money,"


1595
01:14:43.119 --> 01:14:44.710
and they usually
double the amount.


1596
01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.864
Now let me tell you,
"Upload" cost $350,000.


1597
01:14:49.009 --> 01:14:50.856
That's an unheard of
amount of money in porn.


1598
01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:01.581
We shot for 20 days.

1599
01:15:01.606 --> 01:15:03.692
I don't think I've ever known

1600
01:15:03.716 --> 01:15:07.167
a porn movie that
shot for 20 days.


1601
01:15:07.192 --> 01:15:09.923
When "Upload"
won all the awards,


1602
01:15:09.947 --> 01:15:12.306
picked up pretty much almost
everything under the sun at AVN's,


1603
01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:18.252
I felt like such a strong
feeling of an accomplishment.


1604
01:15:22.692 --> 01:15:24.400
One of the things that I learned

1605
01:15:24.997 --> 01:15:26.317
from Eli Cross is he said,

1606
01:15:26.342 --> 01:15:29.130
"There's two things you need,
you need money and time.


1607
01:15:29.833 --> 01:15:33.231
And those two things will always
help you with a better movie."


1608
01:15:33.824 --> 01:15:36.860
We were able to take
the money that we had


1609
01:15:36.885 --> 01:15:40.169
and turn it into time, and
that made for a better movie.


1610
01:15:41.934 --> 01:15:43.208
Whatever you ask...

1611
01:15:45.638 --> 01:15:46.911
I am your servant.

1612
01:15:48.435 --> 01:15:51.304
"Fallen" to this day is my
favorite movie of all time.


1613
01:15:51.329 --> 01:15:53.978
In "Fallen" I am
a guardian angel


1614
01:15:54.002 --> 01:15:56.106
and my charge is Jenna Haze.

1615
01:15:56.435 --> 01:15:58.724
I'm slacking off and she dies.

1616
01:16:05.528 --> 01:16:06.919
No!

1617
01:16:07.044 --> 01:16:08.461
I then lose my wings,

1618
01:16:08.692 --> 01:16:13.489
and I'm sort of roaming
the earth in limbo if you will.


1619
01:16:13.716 --> 01:16:16.630
And I pretty much have
sex with everyone in my path.


1620
01:16:16.724 --> 01:16:19.212
That's one of the things. When
you're in that fantasy realm,


1621
01:16:19.236 --> 01:16:22.337
especially when
you're trying to intercut


1622
01:16:22.361 --> 01:16:24.486
a real story and
a love story at that


1623
01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:26.556
with all this fantasy
stuff with angels


1624
01:16:26.580 --> 01:16:27.966
and flying around on rooftops,

1625
01:16:27.991 --> 01:16:31.278
is can you actually
make this not stupid.


1626
01:16:32.393 --> 01:16:34.461
Oh! Oh!

1627
01:16:34.976 --> 01:16:36.328
A lot has changed.

1628
01:16:37.422 --> 01:16:39.039
I'm no longer an angel.

1629
01:16:39.562 --> 01:16:42.473
"Fallen", I think we
shot it over two weeks,


1630
01:16:42.497 --> 01:16:44.498
but it wasn't every
day of those two weeks.


1631
01:16:44.523 --> 01:16:47.062
We had prep days and
then we had down days, so...


1632
01:16:47.231 --> 01:16:49.877
so people could rest
their parts, you know?


1633
01:16:49.877 --> 01:16:52.750
We had a lot of really
amazing people in it.


1634
01:16:53.429 --> 01:16:55.685
It had acting, it had a
really great storyline.


1635
01:16:55.710 --> 01:16:56.914
It had a lot of sex.

1636
01:16:57.031 --> 01:16:59.414
It had a lot of harder sex, too.

1637
01:16:59.679 --> 01:17:01.842
A lot of "Fallen" takes
place on rooftops,


1638
01:17:01.867 --> 01:17:03.627
and those are
actually in camera.


1639
01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:08.269
I'm... I'm scared of
green screen myself.


1640
01:17:08.293 --> 01:17:11.793
I think "Fallen" stands
on its own merits.


1641
01:17:12.328 --> 01:17:13.750
It's a great story.

1642
01:17:13.877 --> 01:17:16.023
It kind of propelled Jessica

1643
01:17:16.343 --> 01:17:18.586
into that superstar status.

1644
01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:22.375
And, uh, didn't do bad for
me as a director, as well.


1645
01:17:22.585 --> 01:17:25.879
The real reason to do
"Fallen" was to kind of


1646
01:17:25.903 --> 01:17:27.668
have Jessica hit
that other level.


1647
01:17:27.898 --> 01:17:30.789
And it's great if you can
put her in this great movie.


1648
01:17:31.195 --> 01:17:32.835
But if the sex falters,

1649
01:17:32.976 --> 01:17:34.803
then it's just a great movie

1650
01:17:34.828 --> 01:17:36.894
and, you know, you haven't done

1651
01:17:36.918 --> 01:17:38.789
what you're trying
to do with your starlet


1652
01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:41.414
by taking her to that next jump.

1653
01:17:43.093 --> 01:17:44.592
What happened?

1654
01:17:46.424 --> 01:17:47.716
No one knows for sure.

1655
01:17:49.422 --> 01:17:51.041
They call it the big burn.

1656
01:17:53.789 --> 01:17:57.468
And on the eighth day,
God played etch a sketch.


1657
01:17:58.632 --> 01:18:00.968
When I think of a
post-apocalyptic world,


1658
01:18:02.179 --> 01:18:05.037
uh, it's more than just
broken down buildings.


1659
01:18:05.062 --> 01:18:06.648
There's a primal element to it

1660
01:18:07.039 --> 01:18:09.517
where people are
stealing from each other,


1661
01:18:10.398 --> 01:18:12.539
they're violating each
other in more ways than one,


1662
01:18:12.903 --> 01:18:14.648
and life becomes cheaper

1663
01:18:15.093 --> 01:18:16.690
because you don't have
enough at stake anymore.


1664
01:18:16.715 --> 01:18:19.443
My character was
basically being sex trafficked


1665
01:18:19.468 --> 01:18:21.254
in post-apocalyptic, uh...

1666
01:18:22.566 --> 01:18:24.487
I don't think it was
actually set in Los Angeles.


1667
01:18:24.512 --> 01:18:26.617
I mean, just
post-apocalyptic earth.


1668
01:18:27.312 --> 01:18:28.586
You a butcher now, too?

1669
01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:30.836
Special commission
for the prince.


1670
01:18:31.281 --> 01:18:33.273
He gets first look
at all my trade.


1671
01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:35.765
"The 8th Day" was conceived

1672
01:18:36.250 --> 01:18:40.211
by me with Amber Rayne in
mind as the lead character.


1673
01:18:40.921 --> 01:18:43.252
She is the scruffy tank
girl in the whole movie.


1674
01:18:43.546 --> 01:18:45.678
But it was perceived by
everyone that Kayden,


1675
01:18:45.703 --> 01:18:48.273
being Adam & Eve's contract
girl, was the star of the show.


1676
01:18:49.109 --> 01:18:50.613
And she certainly
was the box cover,


1677
01:18:50.637 --> 01:18:52.375
but she is the
supporting actress.


1678
01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:55.546
And, um, when awards time came
out, it was the other way around.


1679
01:18:55.843 --> 01:18:57.756
Amber got supporting
actress nominee


1680
01:18:57.781 --> 01:18:59.835
and Kayden got, you
know, actress nominee.


1681
01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:01.296
And that was ass-backwards.

1682
01:19:01.468 --> 01:19:02.873
"The 8th Day" was

1683
01:19:02.898 --> 01:19:05.015
probably the hardest
movie I've ever worked on.


1684
01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:07.254
There were some
days where we wrapped


1685
01:19:07.278 --> 01:19:10.186
at the time that makeup
had started the day before.


1686
01:19:10.211 --> 01:19:13.129
There were examples
in the movie of, um,


1687
01:19:13.153 --> 01:19:15.699
like a marketplace,
like a bazaar


1688
01:19:15.723 --> 01:19:17.975
that we had to build where
people were hawking junk


1689
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.676
or they were hawking food

1690
01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:22.000
or clothes, things
that they'd scavenged.


1691
01:19:22.085 --> 01:19:25.804
That was a huge undertaking as
far as art direction was concerned.


1692
01:19:25.829 --> 01:19:28.367
The art director, Kylie
Ireland, spent weeks


1693
01:19:28.828 --> 01:19:32.502
running around L.A.
Finding stuff to do there.


1694
01:19:32.502 --> 01:19:36.225
My favorite Kayden moment,
um, in the whole show was


1695
01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:39.086
when she's supposed to break
down and cry about her dad.


1696
01:19:39.671 --> 01:19:41.789
It was before I learned
how to cry by myself.


1697
01:19:42.023 --> 01:19:44.390
And can't get any
tears to flow at all.


1698
01:19:44.882 --> 01:19:47.656
We waited a good long
time, at least a half an hour.


1699
01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:50.710
I walk back in and I
said, "You got nothing?"


1700
01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.404
She goes, "No, nothing
bad's ever happened to me."


1701
01:19:53.429 --> 01:19:55.683
I think they
squirted citrus juice


1702
01:19:55.707 --> 01:19:58.668
or some sort of citrusy fruit
in my eyes to make it go.


1703
01:19:58.796 --> 01:20:00.574
She said, "Holy shit,
let's shoot right now


1704
01:20:00.598 --> 01:20:01.703
'cause god damn it, this burns."

1705
01:20:01.728 --> 01:20:02.627
And I said, "Perfect."

1706
01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.531
My dad did this.

1707
01:20:08.007 --> 01:20:09.000
All of this.

1708
01:20:10.703 --> 01:20:12.006
And she goes, "Why
did you do that to me?"


1709
01:20:12.031 --> 01:20:13.328
I said, "Fuck you,
your life's perfect."


1710
01:20:14.179 --> 01:20:15.554
No wonder you can't cry.

1711
01:20:16.031 --> 01:20:18.801
It was one of those things
after the blood, sweat, and tears


1712
01:20:18.825 --> 01:20:21.420
that went into it, it
was really a nice payoff.


1713
01:20:21.445 --> 01:20:24.014
It was nice to be able to say
someone acknowledged this.


1714
01:20:24.039 --> 01:20:26.492
It wasn't just us, you know,
fucking around in the desert.


1715
01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:28.875
'Cause there were times
when it started to feel that way.


1716
01:20:29.111 --> 01:20:30.336
How did my father die?

1717
01:20:30.882 --> 01:20:33.242
A young jedi named Darth Vader,

1718
01:20:33.481 --> 01:20:35.546
who was a pupil of mine, until I

1719
01:20:35.828 --> 01:20:37.810
cut his arms and legs
off and left him burning


1720
01:20:37.835 --> 01:20:39.421
in a river of lava.

1721
01:20:42.101 --> 01:20:44.812
"Star Wars" is probably the
biggest fanbase in the world.


1722
01:20:44.837 --> 01:20:48.961
it would be.. and there's
so much to parody in it, so,


1723
01:20:50.211 --> 01:20:52.660
We really did... we really did,

1724
01:20:52.685 --> 01:20:55.847
go after every single
pun that could be had,


1725
01:20:55.872 --> 01:20:58.369
everything single obscure
reference that we could have,


1726
01:20:58.393 --> 01:21:00.769
and recreating a
lot of the scenes.


1727
01:21:00.794 --> 01:21:02.004
It was really a lot of fun.

1728
01:21:02.029 --> 01:21:03.794
It's a lot of work, but
we had a lot of fun.


1729
01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:10.927
Shoot first, shoot often.

1730
01:21:13.857 --> 01:21:14.911
Sorry for the mess.

1731
01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:17.697
I feel like you definitely
had to know "Star Wars"


1732
01:21:17.721 --> 01:21:19.279
to one, get the humor.

1733
01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:22.627
Two, understand where... where

1734
01:21:22.651 --> 01:21:23.863
we were trying to go with it

1735
01:21:23.888 --> 01:21:25.220
and what was happening

1736
01:21:25.244 --> 01:21:27.894
with still kind of trying to
stick to the original script.


1737
01:21:27.919 --> 01:21:29.722
The thing that all
the fans would ask me


1738
01:21:29.747 --> 01:21:30.910
in the beginning when
I announce the movies,


1739
01:21:30.935 --> 01:21:33.841
like, okay, there's only
one girl in "Star Wars."


1740
01:21:34.076 --> 01:21:35.605
You're gonna
have a porn movie...


1741
01:21:35.630 --> 01:21:37.822
to this day, people write
on YouTube, they watch,


1742
01:21:38.005 --> 01:21:39.437
you know, they
read about it like


1743
01:21:39.462 --> 01:21:41.173
there's gonna be only one girl?

1744
01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:43.403
It's not true, we
found other girls that


1745
01:21:43.427 --> 01:21:45.070
are part of the "Star
Wars" universe.


1746
01:21:45.095 --> 01:21:47.954
The girls in the canteen, I mean,
there's... there's a ton of people


1747
01:21:47.978 --> 01:21:50.624
that we were able to put
together, it's was really interesting.


1748
01:21:50.649 --> 01:21:52.237
You can find sex in anything.

1749
01:21:52.262 --> 01:21:54.769
I don't necessarily think that,

1750
01:21:54.794 --> 01:21:58.331
you know, the movie or the theme
has to be sexy to make it sexy.


1751
01:21:58.356 --> 01:21:59.877
That's our job,
that's why we're here.


1752
01:21:59.877 --> 01:22:02.050
We're supposed to make the
things that aren't sexy sexy.


1753
01:22:02.075 --> 01:22:05.481
Don't act so surprised,
your highness.


1754
01:22:06.122 --> 01:22:07.559
I'm not surprised.

1755
01:22:08.848 --> 01:22:10.137
I'm disgusted.

1756
01:22:10.239 --> 01:22:11.948
We sat in a room and
he talked into a pot.


1757
01:22:11.973 --> 01:22:13.419
We recorded all his sound in a

1758
01:22:13.444 --> 01:22:16.067
giant pot, like a spaghetti pot.

1759
01:22:16.208 --> 01:22:17.683
It was hilarious.

1760
01:22:17.708 --> 01:22:19.903
Every once in a while
I have a good idea.


1761
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:23.211
And in "Star Wars" it
was like Chi Chi LaRue.


1762
01:22:23.309 --> 01:22:24.794
I'm saved!

1763
01:22:24.965 --> 01:22:25.960
Over here.

1764
01:22:25.985 --> 01:22:27.786
Hey, sailor!

1765
01:22:28.044 --> 01:22:30.485
C-3PO has always
been very metrosexual,


1766
01:22:30.509 --> 01:22:33.477
and I figure we take it, you know,
to parody that, to explore that.


1767
01:22:33.502 --> 01:22:36.001
"Star Wars" won a total
of eight awards at AVN


1768
01:22:36.025 --> 01:22:38.360
which is the most that
any parody has ever won,


1769
01:22:38.384 --> 01:22:40.192
and I think that's amazing.

1770
01:22:40.309 --> 01:22:41.979
It's crazy, um,

1771
01:22:42.004 --> 01:22:44.200
and what's even more amazing

1772
01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:45.919
about that is
most of all that...


1773
01:22:45.944 --> 01:22:47.269
all the work for the movie was

1774
01:22:47.294 --> 01:22:48.532
done behind-the-scenes,

1775
01:22:48.825 --> 01:22:51.308
without the sets,
without the costumes,


1776
01:22:51.333 --> 01:22:53.942
without the time and
dedication for the script.


1777
01:22:54.465 --> 01:22:56.565
The shooting, the
angles, the green screen,


1778
01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:59.870
the post production. The
movie would've been nothing.


1779
01:22:59.895 --> 01:23:02.668
And I think, um, you know,
that really shows and, you know,


1780
01:23:02.856 --> 01:23:05.145
by winning eight AVN
awards, it definitely


1781
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:08.073
shows that other people appreciate
all the hard work that we put into.


1782
01:23:08.098 --> 01:23:11.169
Most know me as death.

1783
01:23:13.497 --> 01:23:15.028
What do you want from me?

1784
01:23:16.044 --> 01:23:17.153
I've come for you.

1785
01:23:19.731 --> 01:23:21.334
The basis behind "Underworld..."

1786
01:23:21.358 --> 01:23:23.270
I play a character named Tanya,

1787
01:23:23.544 --> 01:23:26.731
and I have been with my fiancé

1788
01:23:27.083 --> 01:23:29.884
and we have made the
sweet love, and we're...


1789
01:23:29.908 --> 01:23:31.700
he's getting ready
to drive me home,


1790
01:23:31.725 --> 01:23:33.387
we're in his parking garage,

1791
01:23:33.544 --> 01:23:37.044
and all of a sudden, we're
victims of a violent mugging.


1792
01:23:37.069 --> 01:23:38.489
Say good-bye to your boyfriend.

1793
01:23:39.231 --> 01:23:39.942
No, please!

1794
01:23:42.473 --> 01:23:44.340
The opening is, uh,

1795
01:23:44.365 --> 01:23:46.218
a bit drastic

1796
01:23:46.243 --> 01:23:48.243
and a bit bloody

1797
01:23:48.268 --> 01:23:49.935
and violent, uh,

1798
01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.278
but we actually

1799
01:23:51.303 --> 01:23:53.675
went back and forth on
how violent to make it.


1800
01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.997
And they're trying to save my
life, I'm put under anesthesia.


1801
01:23:57.239 --> 01:23:59.502
And when I go under anesthesia,

1802
01:23:59.989 --> 01:24:02.745
the rest of the movie is that,

1803
01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:05.415
going back and forth
between me fighting for my life


1804
01:24:05.439 --> 01:24:07.345
in the operating room

1805
01:24:07.369 --> 01:24:10.372
and the things that are
happening to me in the underworld.


1806
01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:14.229
If you really watch the
movie, everything pretty much


1807
01:24:14.254 --> 01:24:16.192
is... has a mirror image

1808
01:24:16.356 --> 01:24:20.144
with the people in the operating
room and the underworld below.


1809
01:24:20.169 --> 01:24:22.747
Everything's kind of
tied in and everything's,


1810
01:24:23.106 --> 01:24:25.450
uh, got a ying and
a yang sort of thing.


1811
01:24:25.475 --> 01:24:28.114
Xander Corvus plays Slice

1812
01:24:28.278 --> 01:24:31.676
and he was sort of, uh,
he had scalpel fingers


1813
01:24:31.981 --> 01:24:33.774
and he was up on stilts

1814
01:24:33.798 --> 01:24:36.668
and so he was the scalpel
that was starting the surgery.


1815
01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:39.376
This journey that
you've embarked upon


1816
01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.528
is your subconscious self
reacting to the world around it.


1817
01:24:43.606 --> 01:24:46.085
The nurse was passing
the gauze to the doctor.


1818
01:24:46.348 --> 01:24:48.661
During my operation it fell.

1819
01:24:48.981 --> 01:24:52.430
And as it dropped,
you see an aerialist


1820
01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:54.690
fall out of the sky on gauze.

1821
01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:57.102
So me and Jessica Drake
got to have sex on water,


1822
01:24:57.126 --> 01:24:59.323
or it looked as though it
was directly on the water,


1823
01:24:59.348 --> 01:25:02.417
but it was was actually a
small platform that was built.


1824
01:25:02.442 --> 01:25:04.551
There was maybe like an
inch of water on top of it.


1825
01:25:04.576 --> 01:25:08.329
And I'm bloody in a
shallow pool of water


1826
01:25:08.723 --> 01:25:11.292
for like eight hours that day.

1827
01:25:11.317 --> 01:25:13.368
When the intimidation
melted away was when


1828
01:25:13.392 --> 01:25:15.715
she stumbled on a few of her
lines and laughed at herself.


1829
01:25:16.114 --> 01:25:18.714
And then you realize, like,
someone's a human being,


1830
01:25:18.739 --> 01:25:21.434
and they're a
normal person and...


1831
01:25:22.478 --> 01:25:23.411
that's okay.

1832
01:25:23.585 --> 01:25:27.169
Oh, I love having
sex with Asa Akira.


1833
01:25:27.372 --> 01:25:29.997
Right before the scene, we're
taking pretty girls and I'm like,


1834
01:25:30.165 --> 01:25:32.352
"Oh, this is gonna
be really fun."


1835
01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:35.227
We just sort of got on each
other and rolled off the set.


1836
01:25:35.252 --> 01:25:36.311
We did it everywhere.

1837
01:25:36.336 --> 01:25:38.872
Like, we were
just having sex, so,


1838
01:25:39.129 --> 01:25:43.825
as much as possible, yeah, I would
like to, uh, work with Asa some more.


1839
01:25:44.989 --> 01:25:46.465
Is there anything else you want?

1840
01:25:47.403 --> 01:25:49.864
Apart from... things?

1841
01:25:52.215 --> 01:25:54.583
I mean, what else is
there apart from luxury?


1842
01:25:57.927 --> 01:25:59.721
That can't be a
serious question.


1843
01:26:00.598 --> 01:26:01.989
An indie porno,

1844
01:26:02.489 --> 01:26:03.311
that's what we call it.

1845
01:26:03.336 --> 01:26:04.575
It's like an indie porno.

1846
01:26:04.919 --> 01:26:06.144
It's... it's like a real movie

1847
01:26:06.169 --> 01:26:08.809
with emotion and acting

1848
01:26:09.067 --> 01:26:11.239
and depth and...

1849
01:26:12.676 --> 01:26:14.379
it's porn with a real storyline.

1850
01:26:14.528 --> 01:26:15.653
Why did you come?

1851
01:26:17.919 --> 01:26:20.544
I can't do this again.

1852
01:26:20.569 --> 01:26:23.768
Why did you come
after five fucking years?


1853
01:26:23.793 --> 01:26:26.127
My character, her name's Jacky.

1854
01:26:26.286 --> 01:26:27.434
She's the badass.

1855
01:26:27.459 --> 01:26:29.782
She's definitely the badass
of the movie and she,


1856
01:26:31.504 --> 01:26:34.097
is trying to open

1857
01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:36.294
the other Lily up to this world

1858
01:26:36.319 --> 01:26:38.801
that she's experienced.

1859
01:26:39.215 --> 01:26:42.504
My role in "Wasteland"
was very simple.


1860
01:26:42.567 --> 01:26:44.059
There's two girls at the bar.

1861
01:26:44.676 --> 01:26:47.136
I step up to the bar and I
say something in their ears


1862
01:26:47.161 --> 01:26:49.075
which is easy for me.

1863
01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.823
Take her up to the
bathroom and have


1864
01:26:52.847 --> 01:26:56.137
sex with Lily Labeau
in the bathroom.


1865
01:26:56.395 --> 01:26:58.987
It's a very, very
closed environment,


1866
01:26:59.012 --> 01:27:02.339
it's literally real toilet
so there was no room


1867
01:27:02.364 --> 01:27:04.878
to open the door, shoot, like,

1868
01:27:04.903 --> 01:27:06.106
through the open door.

1869
01:27:06.333 --> 01:27:08.098
They shot it all from above.

1870
01:27:08.247 --> 01:27:10.743
I think he knew that
the best way to use me


1871
01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:13.473
is not to have me speak
but let me just fuck.


1872
01:27:13.622 --> 01:27:15.493
I think that's one of
the biggest things that


1873
01:27:15.517 --> 01:27:17.489
separates "Wasteland" from

1874
01:27:17.723 --> 01:27:20.137
a lot of the other porn is

1875
01:27:20.379 --> 01:27:22.636
that the shots are so beautiful

1876
01:27:22.661 --> 01:27:24.651
and they are thought out.

1877
01:27:24.676 --> 01:27:27.487
Every single shot is thought out

1878
01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.708
and planned to
just... look beautiful.


1879
01:27:29.872 --> 01:27:32.665
It was really, really dark, um,

1880
01:27:32.689 --> 01:27:34.938
where we shot that scene, and

1881
01:27:34.962 --> 01:27:37.688
it was interesting for me

1882
01:27:37.712 --> 01:27:39.614
because I've never shot

1883
01:27:39.954 --> 01:27:42.262
anything in such dark lighting.

1884
01:27:42.364 --> 01:27:44.204
It was just completely
dark. And I was like,


1885
01:27:44.228 --> 01:27:48.081
"Really, like, can you guys
really see what we're shooting?"


1886
01:27:48.106 --> 01:27:49.854
They're like, "Yeah,
yeah, it looks cool."


1887
01:27:49.879 --> 01:27:52.598
It's this whole story
combining to make


1888
01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:55.911
this beautiful movie
with sex involved.


1889
01:27:56.161 --> 01:27:58.161
Judgment had
reared its ugly head.


1890
01:27:59.036 --> 01:28:01.122
And right when my
guard was fully down,


1891
01:28:02.028 --> 01:28:03.661
it suddenly had popped back up.

1892
01:28:06.294 --> 01:28:10.063
Emma goes into interview a man
by the name of William Fitzgerald


1893
01:28:10.087 --> 01:28:12.417
who is this very
prominent businessman


1894
01:28:12.442 --> 01:28:14.284
who employs
predominantly females.


1895
01:28:14.309 --> 01:28:16.442
There's an unspoken
attraction between them.


1896
01:28:16.552 --> 01:28:18.645
And eventually
he propositions her


1897
01:28:18.978 --> 01:28:21.770
for the role of being his sub.

1898
01:28:22.003 --> 01:28:23.620
She's not a very sexual person.

1899
01:28:23.645 --> 01:28:25.227
She definitely doesn't conform

1900
01:28:25.252 --> 01:28:28.176
to normal society's
views of relationships.


1901
01:28:28.450 --> 01:28:31.196
I didn't read the "50
Shades of Grey" book


1902
01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:34.583
or anything like that because I
remember Jacky saying that it was...


1903
01:28:35.036 --> 01:28:37.227
we wanna do pretty
much the opposite of that.


1904
01:28:37.252 --> 01:28:38.685
I read "50 Shades of Grey"

1905
01:28:38.710 --> 01:28:40.413
and I hated how the female

1906
01:28:40.438 --> 01:28:41.668
protagonist was portrayed.

1907
01:28:41.693 --> 01:28:44.222
She was incredibly weak and

1908
01:28:44.246 --> 01:28:47.294
her entire motivation was to please
a man and to make a man happy.


1909
01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.583
I wanted to set about
writing a BDSM story


1910
01:28:50.608 --> 01:28:53.163
that really explored
a strong woman's


1911
01:28:53.679 --> 01:28:57.593
sub role and how that can
be so empowering for her.


1912
01:28:57.618 --> 01:29:01.046
She was, um, living, like,

1913
01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.341
a kind of reserved life

1914
01:29:03.366 --> 01:29:05.083
and not really being herself,

1915
01:29:05.108 --> 01:29:06.560
and that's something that I can

1916
01:29:06.585 --> 01:29:08.325
very much relate to because

1917
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:10.858
I always wanted to just, like,

1918
01:29:10.883 --> 01:29:12.686
be the person that everyone

1919
01:29:12.874 --> 01:29:14.585
wanted me to be.

1920
01:29:14.610 --> 01:29:16.474
BDSM is not just beating

1921
01:29:16.499 --> 01:29:17.752
somebody and harming somebody

1922
01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:19.224
and physically hurting them.

1923
01:29:19.249 --> 01:29:21.552
It's so much about the mental

1924
01:29:21.577 --> 01:29:23.404
aspect of those relationships.

1925
01:29:23.429 --> 01:29:25.310
So for me, I wanted to tell

1926
01:29:25.335 --> 01:29:26.952
a story about that.

1927
01:29:27.211 --> 01:29:29.193
I did feel like, uh, I had

1928
01:29:29.218 --> 01:29:30.654
a little bit of an advantage

1929
01:29:30.679 --> 01:29:33.530
joining the movie because I
had some BDSM experience


1930
01:29:33.804 --> 01:29:36.741
working with different bondage
companies in the industry.


1931
01:29:36.999 --> 01:29:39.311
So it was nice to be able
to bring in a little bit of


1932
01:29:39.502 --> 01:29:41.765
my knowledge and
experience with that


1933
01:29:41.949 --> 01:29:46.671
for a movie that so much, like,
revolves around the BDSM community.


1934
01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:50.935
So "The Submission of Emma
Marx" won best BDSM movie at AVN.


1935
01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.597
And I was completely floored

1936
01:29:52.621 --> 01:29:56.502
because we're up
against BDSM companies.


1937
01:29:56.632 --> 01:30:00.365
And new sensations mainly
is a feature Gonzo studio


1938
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:03.186
that doesn't really focus on
anything particularly hardcore.


1939
01:30:03.211 --> 01:30:06.927
I was really flattered that
they would recognize that film,


1940
01:30:06.952 --> 01:30:09.357
especially given that it wasn't

1941
01:30:09.382 --> 01:30:10.585
really the physicality

1942
01:30:10.585 --> 01:30:11.474
that was explored.

1943
01:30:11.499 --> 01:30:13.444
It was the mental aspect.

1944
01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.880
When I first started, we
were doing film, it was a thrill.


1945
01:30:15.905 --> 01:30:16.843
It was great, you know,

1946
01:30:16.868 --> 01:30:19.279
we're lugging these big ass
cameras around San Francisco


1947
01:30:19.304 --> 01:30:20.405
and having a field day.

1948
01:30:20.616 --> 01:30:23.655
Nobody bothered us, nobody
cared, you just did the movies.


1949
01:30:23.897 --> 01:30:25.007
And the drugs were great.

1950
01:30:25.647 --> 01:30:27.850
And video came out and it was...

1951
01:30:28.061 --> 01:30:29.265
it was a smaller party.

1952
01:30:29.554 --> 01:30:31.108
You didn't need the crew

1953
01:30:31.133 --> 01:30:33.443
you had for 35 millimeter.

1954
01:30:33.468 --> 01:30:35.990
You had way smaller crew, and

1955
01:30:36.015 --> 01:30:38.943
you would just sort
of load it in a Van,


1956
01:30:38.968 --> 01:30:40.419
show up at a location,

1957
01:30:40.452 --> 01:30:41.982
shot your four or five scenes

1958
01:30:42.007 --> 01:30:43.677
and ran out the
door, you were done.


1959
01:30:43.702 --> 01:30:44.804
And the drugs were okay.

1960
01:30:45.710 --> 01:30:48.327
And... and toward the
end, it really just got,


1961
01:30:48.777 --> 01:30:50.186
"How fast can you crank it out

1962
01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:53.577
and get it back to me
and I gotta pedal it..."


1963
01:30:53.602 --> 01:30:54.779
and the drugs sucked.

1964
01:30:54.835 --> 01:30:57.522
It's hard to say where the
porn industry will go from here.


1965
01:30:57.975 --> 01:31:00.474
The Internet era seems
to demand a return


1966
01:31:00.499 --> 01:31:02.310
to the loops and
vignettes that gave birth


1967
01:31:02.335 --> 01:31:04.179
to the erotic film
in the first place.


1968
01:31:04.991 --> 01:31:08.161
It's a shame to think that this
list of the greatest adult movies


1969
01:31:08.186 --> 01:31:09.702
maybe the last of its kind.

1970
01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.608
But the future is hard to see.

1971
01:31:13.108 --> 01:31:17.093
And maybe the adult feature
will surprise us with its longevity.


1972
01:31:17.554 --> 01:31:19.499
I'm Chanel Preston, good night.

1973
01:31:23.788 --> 01:31:27.702
If the brilliant Swedish
filmmaker Ingmar Bergman


1974
01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:30.413
ever made an
X-rated motion picture,


1975
01:31:30.686 --> 01:31:33.124
it would look exactly like this.

1976
01:31:35.919 --> 01:31:38.382
"Prisoner of Paradise"
stars such film greats


1977
01:31:38.647 --> 01:31:39.585
as Seka.

1978
01:31:43.491 --> 01:31:44.334
Fibber.

1979
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:47.585
American, I said over here!

1980
01:31:47.913 --> 01:31:48.874
Fuck me!

1981
01:31:48.944 --> 01:31:51.632
American girls are
lovely creatures.


1982
01:31:53.710 --> 01:31:55.749
Ilsa, tie her up!

1983
01:31:56.288 --> 01:32:00.374
Don't you come in me,
you American swine.


1984
01:32:00.530 --> 01:32:02.333
You'd never guess what these

1985
01:32:02.358 --> 01:32:04.161
sexy young ladies in the

1986
01:32:04.186 --> 01:32:05.983
funny-looking uniforms

1987
01:32:06.335 --> 01:32:07.669
do for a living.

1988
01:32:07.694 --> 01:32:09.038
Garage girls, good morning.

1989
01:32:09.608 --> 01:32:11.224
Watch as these gorgeous

1990
01:32:11.249 --> 01:32:13.200
garage girls mix business

1991
01:32:13.225 --> 01:32:16.194
and pleasure as they climb

1992
01:32:16.257 --> 01:32:17.499
their way to the top.

1993
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:19.413
Here she comes,

1994
01:32:19.647 --> 01:32:21.560
the incredible, voluptuous

1995
01:32:21.584 --> 01:32:23.435
Leslie Bovee in her most

1996
01:32:23.460 --> 01:32:25.436
electrifying role as

1997
01:32:25.827 --> 01:32:27.397
"The Senator's Daughter."

1998
01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:29.374
Co-starring the fabulous

1999
01:32:29.585 --> 01:32:30.499
John Holmes.

2000
01:32:31.444 --> 01:32:33.874
You are an erotic film star

2001
01:32:34.171 --> 01:32:36.296
now lacking an essential member,

2002
01:32:36.749 --> 01:32:38.793
but we can rebuild it.

2003
01:32:38.874 --> 01:32:40.304
"The Senator's Daughter"

2004
01:32:40.741 --> 01:32:43.294
coming to this theater soon.

2005
01:32:54.668 --> 01:32:57.491
I'm still sore here from
what the devil did to me.


2006
01:32:57.936 --> 01:32:59.429
He even made it talk.

2007
01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:01.477
In this case, curiosity

2008
01:33:01.502 --> 01:33:02.874
didn't kill the cat.

2009
01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:04.091
Do you want to find out

2010
01:33:04.116 --> 01:33:05.710
what love is all about?

2011
01:33:05.788 --> 01:33:07.522
Honey, I'm almost ready.

2012
01:33:07.827 --> 01:33:09.272
I'm getting ready.

2013
01:33:10.765 --> 01:33:11.757
Don't miss

2014
01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:14.632
"Here Comes the Bride."

2015
01:33:14.858 --> 01:33:16.585
Coming soon to this theater,

2016
01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:18.100
"The Pleasure Palace."

2017
01:33:18.507 --> 01:33:20.075
The newest X-rated film

2018
01:33:20.100 --> 01:33:21.530
from Carter Stevens.

2019
01:33:22.382 --> 01:33:23.771
The man who gave you such films

2020
01:33:23.796 --> 01:33:24.817
as "Lickity
-Split",

2021
01:33:24.841 --> 01:33:25.800
"The Love Couch,"

2022
01:33:25.824 --> 01:33:27.179
and "Teenage Twins."

2023
01:33:27.538 --> 01:33:29.163
Suzie superstar.

2024
01:33:30.819 --> 01:33:32.240
♪ Baby take off ♪

2025
01:33:32.265 --> 01:33:34.163

2026

2027
01:33:38.382 --> 01:33:39.685
God damn it, you know how

2028
01:33:39.710 --> 01:33:41.085
horny I get when I sing.

2029
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:42.740
Find out what happens when

2030
01:33:42.765 --> 01:33:44.888
two sexy 16-year-old girls

2031
01:33:44.913 --> 01:33:46.411
take their parents car

2032
01:33:46.436 --> 01:33:47.960
and go away for the weekend.

2033
01:33:48.288 --> 01:33:49.107
This is exciting.

2034
01:33:49.132 --> 01:33:51.077
I've never been
to an orgy before.


2035
01:33:51.358 --> 01:33:52.336
Neither have I.

2036
01:33:52.632 --> 01:33:53.522
What's an orgy?

2037
01:33:53.796 --> 01:33:55.341
"Naked Afternoon" is more

2038
01:33:55.366 --> 01:33:56.419
than explicit drama.

2039
01:33:57.483 --> 01:33:58.977
It is the real story of

2040
01:33:59.002 --> 01:34:01.130
a genuine honest-to-god

2041
01:34:01.155 --> 01:34:02.224
woman-child.

2042
01:34:02.249 --> 01:34:03.849
Hollywood in the 30s

2043
01:34:03.874 --> 01:34:05.552
in a big, bright, and bubbling

2044
01:34:05.577 --> 01:34:07.102
blockbuster of a movie.

2045
01:34:07.127 --> 01:34:09.093
You've never seen anything like

2046
01:34:10.968 --> 01:34:12.929
"Pink Champagne."

2047
01:34:16.811 --> 01:34:19.627
You gotta see it to believe it.
