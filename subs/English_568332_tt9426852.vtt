00:00:33.465 --> 00:00:34.841
<i>...declined to address that rumor.</i>

5
00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:37.469
- <i>Global superstar Taylor Swift--</i>
<i>- And the winner is--</i>


6
00:00:37.552 --> 00:00:40.764
<i>This is the first time</i>
<i>photographers have caught T-Swift on film</i>


7
00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:42.474
<i>in six weeks.</i>

<i>The Grammys' youngest-ever</i>
<i>winner of Album of the Year,</i>Fearless.

00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:49.022
<i>-</i><i>Is there bad blood?</i>
<i>-  Taylor Swift is responsible</i>


10
00:00:49.106 --> 00:00:49.940
<i>for me being suspended.</i>

11
00:00:50.023 --> 00:00:51.316
<i>Taylor Swift is in hot water again.</i>

12
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.026
<i>Taylor Swift is on top of the world,</i>

13
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.153
<i>but has she done some sketchy things</i>
<i>to get there?</i>


14
00:00:55.237 --> 00:00:57.030
<i>Thirteen celebs have issues</i>
<i>with Taylor Swift.</i>


15
00:00:57.114 --> 00:00:59.199
- <i>I felt like she was angry.</i>
<i>-  Number 13.</i>


16
00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:01.034
<i>There she is, leaving a restaurant.</i>

17
00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:02.619
<i>She holds too many grudges.</i>

18
00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:04.121
<i>You can see her feet</i>
<i>at the very bottom,</i>


19
00:01:04.204 --> 00:01:05.831
<i>and can see her making her way</i>
<i>into the car.</i>


20
00:01:05.914 --> 00:01:08.333
<i>I can understand trying</i>
<i>to keep your relationship to yourself</i>


21
00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:09.543
<i>at the beginning,</i>

22
00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:12.462
<i>or needing to take some time</i>
<i>to work on your craft,</i>


23
00:01:12.546 --> 00:01:13.797
<i>- but come on!</i>
<i>- And Taylor,</i>


24
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.633
<i>voluntarily bringing attention to herself</i>
<i>with her donation.</i>


25
00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:18.635
<i>What Swift did is not enough.</i>

26
00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.847
- <i>Okay, Tay, whatever you say.</i>
<i>- I-- I hate to say this,</i>


27
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.974
<i>but I think Taylor Swift is learning</i>
<i>a few lessons in life.</i>


28
00:01:24.057 --> 00:01:25.726
<i>All this drama is exhausting, isn't it?</i>

29
00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:28.812
<i>Taylor should focus on making</i>
<i>sure the rest of</i>Reputation <i>is more--</i>


30
00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:31.231
<i>Taylor Swift's new romance is heating up--</i>

31
00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:33.358
- <i>What happened to "The Squad"?</i>
<i>-  Reputation</i>


32
00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:34.609
<i>But at the same time,</i>

33
00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.486
<i>- aren't they both wrong?</i>
<i>-  Reputation</i>


34
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.155
<i>Taylor Swift takes the stand</i>
<i>in court today...</i>


35
00:01:38.238 --> 00:01:39.573
- <i>Taylor Swift's--</i>

00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:41.491
- <i>...playing the victim--</i>

59
00:03:01.112 --> 00:03:02.447
<i>First time that I saw him</i>

60
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.492
<i>Wonder how many girls he had loved</i>
<i>And left haunted</i>


61
00:03:05.575 --> 00:03:08.495
<i>But if he's a ghost</i>

62
00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:10.997
<i>Holding him for ransom-som</i>

63

<i>Some boys are trying too hard</i>
<i>He don't try at all, though</i>


64
00:03:14.334 --> 00:03:17.504
<i>Younger than my exes</i>

65
00:03:17.587 --> 00:03:20.423
<i>I see nothing better</i>

78
00:04:05.886 --> 00:04:08.722

<i>Stealing hearts and running off</i>
<i>And never saying sorry</i>


80
00:04:11.558 --> 00:04:14.144

00:09:21.659 --> 00:09:23.161
<i>What I do next</i>

153
00:09:25.705 --> 00:09:27.373
<i>This is how the world works</i>

154
00:09:27.457 --> 00:09:31.169
<i>You gotta leave before you get left</i>

155
00:09:32.253 --> 00:09:35.006
<i>I can feel the flames on my skin</i>

156
00:09:35.215 --> 00:09:37.675
<i>He says</i>
<i>"Don't throw away a good thing"</i>


157
00:09:37.759 --> 00:09:40.094
<i>If he drops my name</i>
<i>Then I owe him nothin'</i>


158
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:43.848
<i>And if he spends my change</i>
<i>Then he had it comin'</i>


159
00:09:47.936 --> 00:09:49.938
<i>- They say I did something bad</i>
<i>- Bad</i>


160
00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:52.315
<i>Then why's it feel so good?</i>

161
00:09:53.316 --> 00:09:55.944
<i>- They say I did something bad</i>
<i>- Bad</i>


162
00:09:56.361 --> 00:09:59.155
<i>But why's it feel so good?</i>

163
00:09:59.239 --> 00:10:01.783
<i>- Most fun I ever had</i>
<i>- Had</i>


164
00:10:02.116 --> 00:10:07.538
<i>And I'd do it over and over</i>
<i>And over again if I could</i>


165
00:10:07.872 --> 00:10:10.583
<i>It just felt so good</i>

166
00:10:11.167 --> 00:10:12.252
<i>Good</i>

167
00:10:16.506 --> 00:10:18.591
<i>It just feels so good</i>

168
00:10:36.484 --> 00:10:38.278
<i>They're burning all the witches</i>

169
00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:40.989
<i>Even if you aren't one</i>

170
00:10:43.199 --> 00:10:45.743
<i>They got their pitchforks and proof</i>

171
00:10:46.202 --> 00:10:48.997
<i>Their receipts and reasons</i>

172
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.873
<i>They're burning all the witches</i>

173
00:10:50.957 --> 00:10:53.418
<i>Even if you aren't one</i>

174
00:10:54.711 --> 00:10:57.046
<i>And it's just for fun</i>

175
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:03.720
<i>They're burning all the witches</i>

176
00:11:03.803 --> 00:11:06.055
<i>Even if you aren't one</i>

177
00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:10.643
<i>They got pitchforks and proof</i>

178
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:13.688
<i>They don't need their reasons</i>

179
00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:16.357
<i>They're burning all the witches</i>

180
00:11:16.441 --> 00:11:18.484
<i>Even if you aren't one</i>

181
00:11:20.278 --> 00:11:21.154
<i>So light me up</i>

182
00:11:21.237 --> 00:11:22.822
<i>- Light me up</i>
<i>- Light me up</i>


183

187

194
00:11:45.595 --> 00:11:48.264

00:11:48.681 --> 00:11:49.766
<i>Light me up</i>

00:11:49.849 --> 00:11:54.771

<i>- They say I did something bad</i>
<i>- Bad</i>


198
00:12:07.909 --> 00:12:09.911
<i>Then why's it feel so good?</i>

199
00:12:10.828 --> 00:12:13.748
<i>- They say I did something bad</i>
<i>- Bad</i>


200
00:12:13.831 --> 00:12:16.584
<i>But why's it feel so good?</i>

201
00:12:16.876 --> 00:12:19.170
<i>- Most fun I ever had</i>
<i>- Had</i>


202
00:12:19.629 --> 00:12:25.343
<i>And I'd do it over and over</i>
<i>And over again</i> <i>if I could</i>


203
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.304
<i>It just felt so good</i>

204
00:12:28.596 --> 00:12:29.889
<i>Good</i>

205
00:12:30.264 --> 00:12:31.265
<i>Bad</i>

206
00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:36.938
<i>Oh, they say I did something bad</i>

207
00:12:37.105 --> 00:12:39.440
<i>Then why's it feel so good?</i>

208
00:12:40.358 --> 00:12:41.234
<i>Good</i>

209
00:12:41.818 --> 00:12:42.735
<i>Bad</i>

210
00:12:47.657 --> 00:12:51.327
<i>- Bad</i>
<i>- It just felt so good</i>


211
00:12:51.911 --> 00:12:53.121
<i>Good</i>

212
00:13:25.653 --> 00:13:27.238
Well, good evening, Dallas, Texas,

213
00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:30.283
and welcome
to the <i>Reputation</i>stadium tour.


214
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.211
You know, guys, I've been coming to play
in the Dallas-Arlington area...


215
00:13:44.172 --> 00:13:46.507
since I was about 15 years old.

216
00:13:48.384 --> 00:13:49.385
And, uh...

217
00:13:50.595 --> 00:13:53.181
I was looking at the list of times
I've played here


218
00:13:53.264 --> 00:13:57.059
and this is actually the 30th show
that I'll be playing in this area.


219
00:13:57.768 --> 00:13:59.395
I mean...

220
00:14:01.105 --> 00:14:04.150
So that's a good, long history
we've got going on between us


221
00:14:04.233 --> 00:14:06.444
and I want to say thank you
for a few things.


222
00:14:06.819 --> 00:14:10.573
First of all, having been to Dallas
as many times as I've been here,


223
00:14:11.866 --> 00:14:16.204
I know how many things there are available
for you to do on a Saturday night.


224
00:14:16.287 --> 00:14:21.375
You have lots of options and you decided
to spend your Saturday evening with us.


225
00:14:21.459 --> 00:14:22.919
Thank you so much!

226
00:14:29.425 --> 00:14:31.302
Another thing that you guys did...

227
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.724
is that every single one of us
on this stage, on this tour,


228
00:14:36.807 --> 00:14:39.602
gets to know that because of you,

229
00:14:40.645 --> 00:14:41.729
this is the first tour,

230
00:14:41.812 --> 00:14:46.108
nobody has ever played back-to-back nights
at this stadium before.


231
00:14:46.192 --> 00:14:47.235
Thank you, guys!

232
00:14:55.201 --> 00:14:56.410
So, here you are,

233
00:14:57.078 --> 00:14:59.747
deciding to be with us on--

234
00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.959
You may have heard this.
It's a little-known fact.


235
00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:05.378
This is the last
night of the US tour.

236
00:15:09.966 --> 00:15:13.010
And so you decided not only to spend
your Saturday night with us,


237
00:15:13.094 --> 00:15:15.972
but to come here to commemorate
the last night on this tour


238
00:15:16.055 --> 00:15:17.932
that has meant so much to me.

239
00:15:18.015 --> 00:15:19.767
That is such a beautiful thing.

240
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:22.603
Thank you for deciding
all of those things tonight.


241
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:28.943
I would even say...

242
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:31.821
it's something even more than beautiful.

243
00:15:31.904 --> 00:15:34.657
It's like a step above beautiful.

244
00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.701
What's the word for that, Dallas?

245
00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.744
<i>Gorgeous</i>

246
00:15:38.828 --> 00:15:39.745
That's the one.

247
00:15:45.459 --> 00:15:47.169
<i>You should take it as a compliment</i>

248
00:15:47.253 --> 00:15:51.132
<i>That I got drunk</i>
<i>And made fun of the way you talk</i>


249
00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.305
<i>You should think about the consequence</i>

250
00:15:57.555 --> 00:16:01.017
<i>Of your magnetic field</i>
<i>Being a little too strong</i>


251
00:16:05.146 --> 00:16:08.149
<i>And I got a boyfriend</i>
<i>He's older than us</i>


252
00:16:08.399 --> 00:16:10.943
<i>He's in the club doing</i>
<i>I don't know what</i>


253
00:16:11.027 --> 00:16:13.279
<i>You're so cool</i>
<i>It makes me hate you so much</i>


254
00:16:13.362 --> 00:16:14.822
<i>I hate you so much</i>

255
00:16:14.905 --> 00:16:17.408
<i>Whiskey on ice</i>

256
00:16:17.742 --> 00:16:19.660
<i>Sunset and Vine</i>

257
00:16:20.161 --> 00:16:22.580
<i>You've ruined my life</i>

258
00:16:22.788 --> 00:16:25.875
<i>By not being mine</i>

259
00:16:27.251 --> 00:16:29.337
<i>You're so gorgeous</i>

260
00:16:29.754 --> 00:16:33.090
<i>I can't say anything to your face</i>

261
00:16:33.549 --> 00:16:35.343
<i>'Cause look at your face</i>

262
00:16:37.637 --> 00:16:40.181
<i>And I'm so furious</i>

263
00:16:40.264 --> 00:16:43.184
<i>At you for making me feel this way</i>

264
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:47.897
<i>But what can I say?</i>
<i>You're gorgeous</i>


265
00:16:50.816 --> 00:16:52.610
<i>You should take it as a compliment</i>

266
00:16:52.693 --> 00:16:56.155
<i>That I'm talking to everyone here</i>
<i>But you</i>


267
00:16:56.238 --> 00:16:57.448
<i>But you</i>

268
00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.116
<i>But you</i>

269
00:17:00.326 --> 00:17:02.703
<i>And you should think about</i>
<i>The consequence</i>


270
00:17:02.787 --> 00:17:06.499
<i>Of you touching my hand</i>
<i>In a darkened room</i>


271
00:17:06.582 --> 00:17:08.000
<i>Dark room</i>

272
00:17:08.417 --> 00:17:10.211
<i>Dark room</i>

273
00:17:10.294 --> 00:17:13.339
<i>If you've got a girlfriend</i>
<i>I'm jealous of her</i>


274
00:17:13.547 --> 00:17:15.925
<i>But if you're single</i>
<i>That's honestly worse</i>


275
00:17:16.133 --> 00:17:18.511
<i>'Cause you're so gorgeous</i>
<i>It actually hurts</i>


276
00:17:18.886 --> 00:17:20.096
<i>Honey, it hurts</i>

277
00:17:20.179 --> 00:17:22.682
<i>Ocean blue eyes</i>

278
00:17:22.807 --> 00:17:25.351
<i>Looking in mine</i>

279
00:17:25.434 --> 00:17:27.645
<i>I feel like I might</i>

280
00:17:27.853 --> 00:17:30.940
<i>Sink and drown and die</i>

281
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.902
<i>You're so gorgeous</i>

282
00:17:34.985 --> 00:17:37.405
<i>I can't say anything to your face</i>

283
00:17:37.488 --> 00:17:39.073
<i>To your face</i>

284
00:17:39.156 --> 00:17:40.324
<i>'Cause look at your face</i>

285
00:17:40.408 --> 00:17:41.492
<i>Look at your face</i>

286
00:17:42.827 --> 00:17:45.204
<i>And I'm so furious</i>

287
00:17:45.579 --> 00:17:48.040
<i>At you for making me feel this way</i>

288
00:17:48.124 --> 00:17:49.250
<i>Feel this way</i>

289
00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:50.626
<i>But what can I say?</i>

290
00:17:51.127 --> 00:17:53.129
<i>You're gorgeous</i>

291
00:17:53.546 --> 00:17:55.923
And now, Dallas,
I would like to introduce you

293
00:18:01.262 --> 00:18:02.430
Make some noise...

00:18:03.055 --> 00:18:03.931

Thanks for hanging out with us tonight!


305
00:18:34.545 --> 00:18:36.922
<i>You make me so happy</i>
<i>It turns back to sad</i>


306
00:18:37.214 --> 00:18:39.592
<i>There's nothing I hate more</i>
<i>Than what I can't have</i>


307
00:18:39.675 --> 00:18:42.386
<i>You are so gorgeous</i>
<i>It makes me so mad</i>


308
00:18:44.847 --> 00:18:47.349
<i>You make me so happy</i>
<i>It turns back to sad</i>


309
00:18:47.558 --> 00:18:50.102
<i>There's nothing I hate more</i>
<i>Than what I can't have</i>


310
00:18:50.186 --> 00:18:52.980
<i>Guess I'll just stumble on home</i>
<i>To my cats</i>


311
00:18:55.399 --> 00:18:56.358
<i>Alone</i>

312
00:18:57.985 --> 00:18:59.820
<i>Unless you wanna come along</i>

313
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.657
<i>You're so gorgeous</i>

314
00:19:03.741 --> 00:19:07.745
<i>-</i><i>I can't say anything to your face</i>
<i>-</i><i>To your face</i>


315
00:19:07.828 --> 00:19:10.539
<i>-</i><i>'Cause look at your face</i>
<i>-</i><i>Look at your face</i>


316
00:19:11.624 --> 00:19:13.959
<i>And I'm so furious</i>

317
00:19:14.376 --> 00:19:18.005
<i>-</i><i>At you for making me feel this way</i>
<i>-</i><i>Feel this way</i>


318
00:19:18.088 --> 00:19:21.383
<i>But what can I say?</i>
<i>You're gorgeous</i>


319
00:19:21.467 --> 00:19:24.136
<i>You make me so happy</i>
<i>It turns back to sad</i>


320
00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.597
<i>There's nothing I hate more</i>
<i>Than what I can't have</i>


321
00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.266
<i>You are so gorgeous</i>
<i>It makes me so mad</i>


322
00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:31.727
<i>You're gorgeous</i>

323
00:19:31.811 --> 00:19:34.730
<i>You make me so happy</i>
<i>It turns back to sad</i>


324
00:19:34.814 --> 00:19:36.732
<i>There's nothing I hate more</i>
<i>Than what I can't have</i>


325
00:19:36.816 --> 00:19:37.775
<i>What I can't have</i>

326
00:19:37.858 --> 00:19:39.568
<i>You are so gorgeous</i>
<i>It makes me so mad</i>


327
00:19:39.652 --> 00:19:40.486
Mmm!

328
00:19:40.736 --> 00:19:42.738
<i>You're gorgeous</i>

329
00:20:11.058 --> 00:20:14.603
<i>You got that James Dean daydream</i>

330
00:20:14.687 --> 00:20:16.230
<i>
- Look in your eye</i>

331
00:20:16.313 --> 00:20:19.608
<i>And I got that red lip classic</i>

332
00:20:19.692 --> 00:20:21.151
<i>Thing that you like</i>

333
00:20:21.235 --> 00:20:24.029
<i>And when we go crashing down</i>

334
00:20:24.113 --> 00:20:25.906
<i>We come back every time</i>

335
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.450
<i>'Cause we never go out of style</i>

336
00:20:28.826 --> 00:20:31.120
<i>We never go out of style</i>

337
00:20:31.203 --> 00:20:36.292
<i>You got that long hair slicked back</i>
<i>White T-shirt</i>


338
00:20:36.375 --> 00:20:39.169
<i>And I got that good girl faith</i>

339
00:20:39.253 --> 00:20:41.297
<i>And a tight little skirt</i>

340

<i>Midnight</i>

345
00:21:05.571 --> 00:21:09.283
<i>You come and pick me up, no headlights</i>

346
00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:14.246
<i>Long drive</i>

347
00:21:15.706 --> 00:21:19.543
<i>Could end in burning flames</i>
<i>Or paradise</i>


348
00:21:22.504 --> 00:21:24.882
<i>Fade into view, oh</i>

349
00:21:25.215 --> 00:21:29.136
<i>It's been a while</i>
<i>Since I have even heard from you</i>


350
00:21:30.304 --> 00:21:31.722
<i>Heard from you</i>

351
00:21:33.891 --> 00:21:36.268
<i>I should just tell you to leave</i>
<i>'Cause I</i>


352
00:21:36.352 --> 00:21:38.520
<i>Know exactly where it leads but I</i>

353
00:21:38.604 --> 00:21:41.190
<i>Watch us go 'round and 'round</i>
<i>Each time</i>


354
00:21:42.024 --> 00:21:45.694
<i>'Cause you got that</i>
<i>James Dean daydream</i>

368
00:22:23.774 --> 00:22:27.111
Dallas, will you please make some noise
for my incredible band?


369
00:22:47.589 --> 00:22:51.260
<i>We were both young</i>
<i>When I first saw you</i>


370
00:22:51.677 --> 00:22:55.139
<i>Close my eyes and the flashback starts</i>

371
00:22:55.222 --> 00:22:56.682
<i>I'm standing there</i>

372
00:22:58.142 --> 00:23:01.270
<i>On a balcony in summer air</i>

373
00:23:03.814 --> 00:23:07.359
<i>See the lights</i>
<i>See the party, the ball gowns</i>


374
00:23:07.818 --> 00:23:12.656
<i>See you make your way through the crowd</i>
<i>And say, "Hello"</i>


375
00:23:14.867 --> 00:23:17.202
<i>Little did I know</i>

376
00:23:19.788 --> 00:23:23.250
<i>That you were Romeo</i>
<i>You were throwing pebbles</i>


377
00:23:23.333 --> 00:23:27.129
<i>And my daddy said</i>
<i>"Stay away from Juliet"</i>


378
00:23:27.212 --> 00:23:29.923
<i>And I was crying on the staircase</i>

379
00:23:30.257 --> 00:23:33.927
<i>Begging you, "Please don't go"</i>

380
00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:35.637
<i>And I said</i>

381
00:23:35.971 --> 00:23:39.850
<i>Romeo, take me somewhere</i>
<i>We can be alone</i>


382
00:23:39.933 --> 00:23:44.104
<i>I'll be waiting</i>
<i>All that's left to do is run</i>


383
00:23:44.188 --> 00:23:47.733
<i>You'll be the prince</i>
<i>And I'll be the princess</i>


384
00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:53.113
<i>It's a love story</i>
<i>Baby, just say, "Yes"</i>


385
00:23:55.491 --> 00:23:57.409
<i>Oh, oh</i>

386
00:24:07.377 --> 00:24:09.880
<i>I got tired of waiting</i>

387
00:24:11.423 --> 00:24:14.968
<i>Wondering if you were ever</i>
<i>Coming around</i>


388
00:24:15.052 --> 00:24:19.181
<i>My faith in you was fading</i>

389
00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:24.311
<i>When I met you on the outskirts of town</i>
<i>I said</i>


390
00:24:24.394 --> 00:24:28.023
<i>Romeo, save me</i>
<i>I've been feeling so alone</i>


391
00:24:28.482 --> 00:24:32.027
<i>I keep waiting for you</i>
<i>But you never come</i>


392
00:24:32.361 --> 00:24:36.156
<i>Is this in my head?</i>
<i>I don't know what to think</i>


393
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:40.661
<i>He knelt to the ground</i>
<i>And pulled out a ring and said</i>


394
00:24:40.744 --> 00:24:44.373
<i>Marry me, Juliet</i>
<i>You'll never have to be alone</i>


395
00:24:44.456 --> 00:24:48.544
<i>I love you</i>
<i>And that's all I really know</i>


396
00:24:48.627 --> 00:24:52.464
<i>I talked to your dad</i>
<i>Go pick out a white dress</i>


397
00:24:52.548 --> 00:24:56.635
<i>It's a love story, baby, just say</i>

398
00:24:57.136 --> 00:24:58.428
<i>"Yes"</i>

399
00:25:10.065 --> 00:25:13.443
<i>Oh, I remember you driving to my house</i>

400
00:25:13.527 --> 00:25:14.987
<i>In the middle of the night</i>

401
00:25:15.362 --> 00:25:19.158
<i>I'm the one who makes you laugh</i>
<i>When you know you're 'bout to cry</i>


402
00:25:19.408 --> 00:25:22.703
<i>I know your favorite songs</i>
<i>And you tell me about your dreams</i>


403
00:25:22.786 --> 00:25:28.083
<i>And you know where you belong</i>
<i>You can always be with me</i>


404
00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.133
<i>You can see that I'm the one</i>
<i>Who understands you</i>


405
00:25:36.216 --> 00:25:42.014
<i>Been here all along</i>
<i>So, why can't you see</i>


406
00:25:42.097 --> 00:25:45.559
<i>You belong with me, yeah</i>

407
00:25:45.642 --> 00:25:46.602
Let me see you jump!

408
00:25:47.186 --> 00:25:50.480
<i>Standing by and waiting</i>
<i>At your back door</i>


409
00:25:50.898 --> 00:25:56.737
<i>All this time</i>
<i>How could you not know, baby?</i>


410
00:25:56.820 --> 00:26:00.532
<i>You belong with me</i>

411
00:26:00.616 --> 00:26:02.117
<i>You belong with me</i>

412
00:26:04.286 --> 00:26:06.955
<i>You belong with me</i>

413
00:26:07.039 --> 00:26:11.585
<i>Have you ever thought just maybe</i>

414
00:26:11.668 --> 00:26:15.297
<i>You belong with me?</i>

415
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.924
<i>You belong with me</i>

416
00:27:44.928 --> 00:27:45.929
<i>I</i>

417
00:27:52.352 --> 00:27:53.395
<i>I</i>

418
00:28:29.806 --> 00:28:34.436
<i>I don't like your little games</i>

419
00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:38.065
<i>Don't like your tilted stage</i>

420
00:28:38.148 --> 00:28:41.651
<i>The role you made me play</i>

421
00:28:41.735 --> 00:28:44.488
<i>Of the fool, no, 
I don't like you</i>

422
00:28:44.863 --> 00:28:48.784
<i>I don't like your perfect crime</i>

423
00:28:49.409 --> 00:28:52.704
<i>How you laugh when you lie</i>

424
00:28:53.205 --> 00:28:57.334
<i>You said the gun was mine</i>
<i>Isn't cool</i>


425
00:28:57.751 --> 00:28:59.920
<i>- No, I don't like you</i>
<i>- Oh</i>


426
00:29:00.003 --> 00:29:03.715
<i>But I got smarter</i>
<i>I got harder in the nick of time</i>


427
00:29:03.799 --> 00:29:06.968
<i>Honey, I rose up from the dead</i>
<i>I do it all the time</i>


428
00:29:07.511 --> 00:29:11.264
<i>I've got a list of names</i>
<i>And yours is in red, underlined</i>


429
00:29:11.681 --> 00:29:14.768
<i>I check it once</i>
<i>Then I check it twice, oh!</i>


430
00:29:14.851 --> 00:29:16.895
<i>Ooh, look what you made me do</i>

431
00:29:17.312 --> 00:29:19.356

435
00:29:29.866 --> 00:29:34.371
<i>I don't like your kingdom keys</i>

436
00:29:34.454 --> 00:29:37.707
<i>They once belonged to me</i>

437
00:29:38.166 --> 00:29:41.378
<i>You asked me for a place to sleep</i>

438
00:29:41.628 --> 00:29:44.589
<i>- Locked me out and threw a feast</i>
<i>- What?</i>


439
00:29:45.048 --> 00:29:48.677
<i>The world moves on</i>
<i>Another day, another drama, drama</i>


440
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.139
<i>But not for me, not for me</i>
<i>All I think about is karma</i>


441
00:29:52.556 --> 00:29:55.684
<i>And then the world moves on</i>
<i>But one thing's for sure</i>


442
00:29:56.309 --> 00:29:59.855
<i>Maybe I got mine</i>
<i>But you'll all get yours</i>


443
00:30:00.105 --> 00:30:03.358
<i>But I got smarter</i>

604
00:39:00.812 --> 00:39:02.480
<i>And all at once</i>

605
00:39:46.482 --> 00:39:47.775
<i>And all at once</i>

606
00:39:48.943 --> 00:39:50.153
<i>I've been waiting</i>

607
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:52.280
<i>Waiting</i>

608
00:39:52.655 --> 00:39:54.782
<i>Body and soul, ooh whoa</i>

609
00:39:55.199 --> 00:39:56.576
<i>And all at once</i>

610
00:39:57.452 --> 00:39:59.120
<i>I've been waiting</i>

611
00:39:59.746 --> 00:40:00.955
<i>Waiting</i>

612
00:40:01.497 --> 00:40:03.958
<i>Body and soul, ooh whoa</i>

613
00:40:04.042 --> 00:40:06.544
<i>And all at once, oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

614
00:40:07.211 --> 00:40:08.463
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

615
00:40:09.422 --> 00:40:11.090
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

616
00:40:11.466 --> 00:40:13.801
<i>Oh oh-oh oh oh-oh</i>

617
00:40:13.885 --> 00:40:15.094
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

618
00:40:15.928 --> 00:40:17.513
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

619
00:40:17.972 --> 00:40:19.474
<i>Oh-oh</i>

620
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:22.101
<i>Oh oh-oh oh oh-oh</i>

621
00:40:39.994 --> 00:40:41.496
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

622
00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.748
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

623
00:40:44.332 --> 00:40:45.708
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

624
00:40:46.417 --> 00:40:48.419
<i>Oh oh-oh oh oh-oh</i>

625
00:40:48.753 --> 00:40:50.338
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

626
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.381
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

627
00:40:53.007 --> 00:40:54.717
<i>Oh-oh, oh-oh</i>

628
00:40:55.218 --> 00:40:57.428
<i>Oh oh-oh oh oh-oh</i>

629
00:41:19.283 --> 00:41:20.993
I love you, Taylor!

630
00:41:21.202 --> 00:41:22.245
Are we having fun yet?

631
00:41:27.166 --> 00:41:28.334
Oh, good.

632
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.379
You know, you may notice this...

633
00:41:32.296 --> 00:41:35.842
Not sure if you picked up on it yet.
I'm pretty sure you have, though.


634
00:41:35.925 --> 00:41:40.555
Have you noticed that you have
a light-up bracelet on your wrist?


635
00:41:40.638 --> 00:41:41.806
There they are.

636
00:41:44.433 --> 00:41:45.685
So pretty.

637
00:41:46.018 --> 00:41:48.396
Um, but that's not the only thing
about them.


638
00:41:48.479 --> 00:41:51.357
The reason why I wanted to have these
on the tour


639
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.902
is because this is actually my very first

640
00:41:54.986 --> 00:41:57.697
all-stadium tour, which...

641
00:42:02.076 --> 00:42:05.413
Which has been so, so much fun
because of you.


642
00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.455
Um...

643
00:42:06.873 --> 00:42:10.668
So, one thing I do know about stadiums
is they're just...


644
00:42:11.627 --> 00:42:13.588
massive places to play,

645
00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:16.299
and so I wanted to make sure
that no matter what,


646
00:42:17.049 --> 00:42:20.386
I could see every single one of you
in these stadiums.


647
00:42:20.595 --> 00:42:22.263
So if you're on the...

648
00:42:22.346 --> 00:42:25.391
...top, top deck, last row

649
00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:29.187
and you think I can't see you,
that would be incorrect.


650
00:42:30.313 --> 00:42:33.357
I can see absolutely every person
in this stadium.


651
00:42:34.901 --> 00:42:36.194
And I can see you dancing,

652
00:42:36.277 --> 00:42:39.030
I can see you
throwing your hands in the air.


653
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:41.449
And on top of that, I can hear...

654
00:42:42.325 --> 00:42:43.159
I can hear the--

655
00:42:43.743 --> 00:42:46.746
It really seems
like every single person in this crowd


656
00:42:46.829 --> 00:42:48.915
has memorized every single word
to the songs,


657
00:42:49.165 --> 00:42:52.293
and is not just singing them, but like...

658
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:53.961
...screaming them.

659
00:42:58.216 --> 00:42:59.675
If I had to take a guess

660
00:43:00.426 --> 00:43:01.928
and say the one thing...

661
00:43:02.762 --> 00:43:05.723
that probably everybody in this stadium
has in common...


662
00:43:07.266 --> 00:43:10.019
I think I would say
that one thing would be...


663
00:43:10.853 --> 00:43:14.523
that we all like the feeling
of finding something real.


664
00:43:15.399 --> 00:43:16.400
Like...

665
00:43:17.068 --> 00:43:19.904
you know, finding real friendship
or finding real love


666
00:43:19.987 --> 00:43:21.989
or somebody who really gets you.

667
00:43:22.782 --> 00:43:25.117
Or someone who's really honest with you.

668
00:43:25.201 --> 00:43:29.580
I think-- I think that's what we're really
all looking for in life, and...


669
00:43:30.456 --> 00:43:34.168
I think the things that can scare us
the most in life


670
00:43:34.669 --> 00:43:37.046
are the things that we think will threaten

671
00:43:37.672 --> 00:43:40.424
the prospect of us finding something real.

672
00:43:41.592 --> 00:43:42.593
For example,

673
00:43:43.469 --> 00:43:47.056
having a bad reputation, in our mind,

674
00:43:48.349 --> 00:43:50.643
could get in the way of you finding...

675
00:43:51.352 --> 00:43:54.480
real friendship, real love,
real acceptance,


676
00:43:54.563 --> 00:43:57.275
people you really fit in with.
Because you think to yourself,


677
00:43:57.358 --> 00:44:00.111
"What if they've heard something about me
that isn't true?


678
00:44:00.194 --> 00:44:02.655
What if they've got
these preconceived notions about me


679
00:44:02.738 --> 00:44:04.365
that they heard from gossip?

680
00:44:04.824 --> 00:44:06.867
And then they never even wanna meet me,

681
00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.453
and then we'll never know
what could've happened."


682
00:44:10.454 --> 00:44:12.331
And I think that's why some of us--

683
00:44:13.207 --> 00:44:15.960
meaning most, if not all of us--

684
00:44:16.043 --> 00:44:18.963
are sort of afraid
of having a bad reputation.


685
00:44:19.463 --> 00:44:22.091
Because we're so scared of something fake,

686
00:44:22.383 --> 00:44:24.927
like gossip or a rumor about you,

687
00:44:25.386 --> 00:44:27.054
or a name you got called,

688
00:44:27.763 --> 00:44:30.182
getting in the way
of you finding something real.


689
00:44:30.975 --> 00:44:34.687
And so, when it comes down
to that fear and that anxiety,


690
00:44:37.273 --> 00:44:40.401
it's just all really delicate,
don't you think, Dallas?


691
00:44:43.863 --> 00:44:45.656
<i>This ain't for the best</i>

692
00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.492
<i>My reputation's never been worse, so</i>

693
00:44:48.909 --> 00:44:50.453
<i>You must like me for me</i>

694
00:44:54.123 --> 00:44:55.750
<i>We can't make</i>

695
00:44:55.833 --> 00:44:58.502
<i>Any promises now, can we, babe?</i>

696
00:44:58.878 --> 00:45:00.838
<i>But you can make me a drink</i>

697
00:45:00.921 --> 00:45:03.257
One, two, three, let's go!

698
00:45:03.341 --> 00:45:05.843
<i>Dive bar on the East Side</i>
<i>Where you at?</i>


699
00:45:05.926 --> 00:45:08.387
<i>Phone lights up my nightstand</i>
<i>In the black</i>


700
00:45:08.471 --> 00:45:11.140
<i>Come here, you can
meet me in the back</i>

701
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:15.978
<i>Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you</i>

702
00:45:16.062 --> 00:45:18.481
<i>Oh damn, never seen that color blue</i>

703
00:45:18.564 --> 00:45:21.233
<i>Just think of the fun things</i>
<i>We could do</i>


704
00:45:22.568 --> 00:45:24.111
<i>'Cause I like you</i>

705
00:45:24.195 --> 00:45:25.488
<i>This ain't for the best</i>

706
00:45:26.155 --> 00:45:28.866
<i>My reputation's never been worse,</i> <i>so</i>

707
00:45:29.283 --> 00:45:31.077
<i>You must like me for me</i>

708
00:45:32.787 --> 00:45:34.538
<i>Yeah, I want you</i>

709
00:45:34.622 --> 00:45:35.790
<i>We can't make</i>

710

<i>But you can make me a drink</i>

712
00:45:43.547 --> 00:45:45.966
<i>Is it cool that I said all that?</i>

713
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:48.594
<i>Is it chill that you're in my head?</i>

714
00:45:48.677 --> 00:45:50.971
<i>'Cause I know that it's delicate</i>

715
00:45:51.889 --> 00:45:53.432

716
00:45:53.682 --> 00:45:56.102
<i>Is it cool that I said all that</i>

717
00:45:56.185 --> 00:45:58.646

718

719

724
00:46:14.203 --> 00:46:16.580
<i>Third floor on the West Side</i>
<i>Me and you</i>


725

729

<i>Stay here, honey, 
I don't wanna share</i>

<i>Is it cool that I said all that?</i>

762
00:48:09.735 --> 00:48:12.530

All right, Dallas. I...

771
00:48:39.765 --> 00:48:41.475
just decided to do...

772
00:48:42.476 --> 00:48:45.396
a little exploring around the stadium
to see...


773
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:48.774
if you guys are having a good time
back here.


774
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:51.986
Are things fun back here?

775
00:48:52.528 --> 00:48:55.197
All right. Well, would you dance with me?
What do you say?


776
00:49:03.539 --> 00:49:05.124

778
00:49:09.461 --> 00:49:12.214

Give it up again
for Charli XCX and Camila Cabello!


851
00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:32.766
So, you guys,

852
00:53:33.392 --> 00:53:34.852
I was wondering if, um...

853
00:53:35.769 --> 00:53:38.063
if it would be all right with you
if we just had a...


854
00:53:38.772 --> 00:53:39.815
Thank you so much.

855
00:53:40.649 --> 00:53:41.483
There's a--

856
00:53:41.817 --> 00:53:44.152
I feel like it's really important
to be honest with you guys.


857
00:53:44.236 --> 00:53:47.364
I have a little-- a tiny, minuscule cold.

858
00:53:47.447 --> 00:53:48.740
Do not mind this.

859
00:53:49.491 --> 00:53:51.743
This is just gonna
be me blowing my nose.

860
00:53:52.536 --> 00:53:54.079
I'm gonna turn around to do it.

861
00:54:02.421 --> 00:54:05.048
But I-- What I really think
we all need to take note of


862
00:54:05.132 --> 00:54:08.010
is how Giuseppe presented me
with the tissue.


863
00:54:08.093 --> 00:54:09.261
Like this.

864
00:54:13.056 --> 00:54:14.892
That's like the best thing I've ever seen.

865
00:54:15.559 --> 00:54:20.898
I've never been handed a tissue
with more presentation and commitment.


866
00:54:21.773 --> 00:54:23.233
Um, okay, guys.

867
00:54:24.192 --> 00:54:25.903
Wanna talk to you about something.

868
00:54:25.986 --> 00:54:29.239
I'm proposing the idea
that we spend some time


869
00:54:29.323 --> 00:54:32.534
with just you and me and the guitar.
Is that all right with you?


870
00:54:38.332 --> 00:54:40.459
So, one thing that you guys
have always been...


871
00:54:40.876 --> 00:54:42.127
really, uh...

872
00:54:42.961 --> 00:54:46.131
really not just supportive about,
but you've, um--


873
00:54:46.214 --> 00:54:48.800
'Cause that sounds like you were,
like, understanding of it.


874
00:54:48.884 --> 00:54:52.054
You've really encouraged me
to experiment with my music


875
00:54:52.262 --> 00:54:55.766
and try different things,
try different sounds,


876
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:57.601
try different instruments. Um...

877
00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:02.981
You guys were always the ones pushing me
to experiment and grow.


878
00:55:03.065 --> 00:55:05.859
And I really appreciate that. 'Cause...

879
00:55:06.693 --> 00:55:08.528
I have had so much fun

880
00:55:08.987 --> 00:55:12.407
switching up, you know, styles of music...

881
00:55:14.326 --> 00:55:16.411
genres... um...

882
00:55:18.455 --> 00:55:21.249
And there are a lot of people
in the music industry


883
00:55:21.333 --> 00:55:24.044
that thought when you start
in one genre of music, you stay there,


884
00:55:24.127 --> 00:55:27.047
because that's what people are used to
and that's what they like.


885
00:55:27.464 --> 00:55:31.051
But my relationship with you
and how much we talk...


886
00:55:31.635 --> 00:55:34.721
online, how much we meet each other
at the shows,


887
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:37.265
or like at my house, or...

888
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:38.892
Um...

889
00:55:42.646 --> 00:55:44.982
I know from our conversations that

890
00:55:45.941 --> 00:55:48.068
you guys are so

891
00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:51.989
all about lyrics and all about a feeling,

892
00:55:52.072 --> 00:55:54.783
and all about, if whatever it is

893
00:55:54.866 --> 00:55:57.786
that the person that you listen to
is singing about


894
00:55:57.869 --> 00:55:59.663
what you happen to be going through,

895
00:55:59.997 --> 00:56:02.332
or did go through
at one point in time, I--


896
00:56:02.958 --> 00:56:07.004
I think that's kind of all you care about
when it comes to a song.


897
00:56:09.965 --> 00:56:11.967
So I've always written songs...

898
00:56:13.135 --> 00:56:16.596
with the lyrics, the feeling,
and the melody in mind,


899
00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.809
hoping that no matter what production
I added to the top of it,


900
00:56:20.892 --> 00:56:25.439
whether it took a turn for pop
or acoustic or whatever...


901
00:56:26.314 --> 00:56:30.068
I always wanted for a song
to be able to be stripped back down...


902
00:56:31.403 --> 00:56:33.613
and still be something that you liked

903
00:56:33.697 --> 00:56:36.950
and wanted to sing
at the top of your lungs.


904
00:56:43.707 --> 00:56:46.293
<i>I loved you in secret</i>

905
00:56:46.752 --> 00:56:49.588
<i>First sight, yeah</i>
<i>We love without reason</i>


906
00:56:49.921 --> 00:56:52.674
<i>Oh, 25 years old</i>

907
00:56:52.966 --> 00:56:55.969
<i>Oh, how were you to know, and</i>

908
00:56:56.344 --> 00:56:59.056
<i>My love had been frozen</i>

909
00:56:59.347 --> 00:57:02.225
<i>Deep blue, but you painted me golden</i>

910
00:57:02.601 --> 00:57:05.312
<i>Oh, and you held me close</i>

911
00:57:05.562 --> 00:57:08.273
<i>Oh, how was I to know that</i>

912
00:57:08.356 --> 00:57:11.318
<i>I could've spent forever</i>
<i>With your hands in my pockets</i>


913
00:57:11.401 --> 00:57:14.321
<i>Picture of your face</i>
<i>In an invisible locket</i>


914
00:57:14.613 --> 00:57:17.199
<i>You said there was nothing in the world</i>
<i>That could stop it</i>


915
00:57:17.282 --> 00:57:19.534
<i>I had a bad feeling</i>

916
00:57:20.368 --> 00:57:23.914
<i>And darling, you had turned my bed</i>
<i>Into a sacred oasis</i>


917
00:57:23.997 --> 00:57:27.042
<i>People started talking</i>
<i>Putting us through our paces</i>


918
00:57:27.125 --> 00:57:29.628
<i>I knew there was no one in the world</i>
<i>That could take it</i>


919
00:57:29.711 --> 00:57:32.339
<i>I had a bad feeling</i>

920
00:57:32.672 --> 00:57:33.882
<i>But we were dancing</i>

921
00:57:35.634 --> 00:57:38.512
<i>Dancing with our hands tied</i>
<i>Hands tied</i>


922
00:57:38.595 --> 00:57:40.097
<i>Yeah, we were dancing</i>

923
00:57:41.556 --> 00:57:44.559
<i>Like it was the first time, first time</i>

924
00:57:44.643 --> 00:57:45.894
<i>Yeah, we were dancing</i>

925
00:57:47.604 --> 00:57:50.690
<i>Dancing with our hands tied</i>
<i>Hands tied</i>


926
00:57:50.774 --> 00:57:52.234
<i>Yeah, we were dancing</i>

927
00:57:53.944 --> 00:57:56.822
<i>And I had a bad feeling</i>

928
00:57:56.905 --> 00:57:58.281
<i>But we were dancing</i>

929
00:57:58.365 --> 00:58:01.201
<i>I loved you in spite of</i>

930
00:58:01.284 --> 00:58:04.412
<i>Deep fears that the world</i>
<i>Would divide us</i>


931
00:58:04.496 --> 00:58:07.374
<i>So, baby, can we dance</i>

932
00:58:07.707 --> 00:58:10.168
<i>Oh, through an avalanche?</i>

933
00:58:10.252 --> 00:58:13.338
<i>And say, say that we got it</i>

934
00:58:13.421 --> 00:58:16.842
<i>I'm a mess</i>
<i>But I'm the mess that you wanted</i>


935
00:58:17.425 --> 00:58:19.636
<i>Oh, 'cause it's gravity</i>

936
00:58:20.512 --> 00:58:22.931
<i>Oh, keeping you with me</i>

937
00:58:23.014 --> 00:58:26.351
<i>I could've spent forever</i>
<i>With your hands in my pockets</i>


938
00:58:26.434 --> 00:58:29.062
<i>Picture of your face</i>
<i>In an invisible locket</i>


939
00:58:29.563 --> 00:58:32.023
<i>You said there was nothing in the world</i>
<i>That could stop it</i>


940
00:58:32.107 --> 00:58:34.651
<i>I had a bad feeling</i>

941
00:58:34.985 --> 00:58:36.695
<i>But we were dancing</i>

942
00:58:38.071 --> 00:58:40.991
<i>Dancing with our hands tied</i>
<i>Hands tied</i>


943
00:58:41.074 --> 00:58:42.576
<i>Yeah, we were dancing</i>

944
00:58:44.035 --> 00:58:47.080
<i>Like it was the first time, first time</i>

945
00:58:47.164 --> 00:58:48.665
<i>Yeah, we were dancing</i>

946
00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:53.170
<i>Dancing with our hands tied</i>
<i>Hands tied</i>


947
00:58:53.253 --> 00:58:54.838
<i>Yeah, we were dancing</i>

948
00:58:56.464 --> 00:58:59.467
<i>And I had a bad feeling</i>

949
00:58:59.551 --> 00:59:02.012
<i>But we were dancing</i>

950
00:59:32.083 --> 00:59:34.711
<i>I'd kiss you as the lights went out</i>

951
00:59:35.170 --> 00:59:37.964
<i>Swaying as the room burned down</i>

952
00:59:38.548 --> 00:59:42.093
<i>I'd hold you as the water rushes in</i>

953
00:59:42.177 --> 00:59:44.971
<i>If I could dance with you again</i>

954
00:59:45.055 --> 00:59:47.474
<i>I'd kiss you as the lights went out</i>

955
00:59:48.183 --> 00:59:50.602
<i>Swaying as the room burned down</i>

956
00:59:51.353 --> 00:59:54.814
<i>I'd hold you as the water rushes in</i>

957
00:59:54.898 --> 00:59:57.734
<i>If I could dance with you again</i>

958
00:59:58.276 --> 01:00:01.029
<i>Dancing with our hands tied</i>
<i>Hands tied</i>


959
01:00:01.363 --> 01:00:02.822
<i>Yeah, we were dancing</i>

960
01:00:04.241 --> 01:00:07.452
<i>Like it was the first time, first time</i>

961
01:00:07.535 --> 01:00:08.703
<i>We were dancing</i>

962
01:00:10.163 --> 01:00:13.083
<i>Dancing with our hands tied</i>
<i>Hands tied</i>


963
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.585
<i>We were dancing</i>

964
01:00:16.336 --> 01:00:19.381
<i>And I had a bad feeling</i>

965
01:00:19.464 --> 01:00:21.591
<i>But we were dancing</i>

966
01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:57.294
So, um...

967
01:00:58.837 --> 01:01:00.922
You know, when I write a song...

968
01:01:01.631 --> 01:01:03.633
When I write a song, it's usually...

969
01:01:04.384 --> 01:01:05.927
me just trying to...

970
01:01:07.304 --> 01:01:08.513
get past something

971
01:01:08.596 --> 01:01:10.974
and understand something
I'm going through...


972
01:01:11.975 --> 01:01:13.893
by writing about it, and...

973
01:01:14.769 --> 01:01:16.646
that was definitely the case

974
01:01:16.813 --> 01:01:19.357
um, when I wrote the next song
I'm gonna play.


975
01:01:20.066 --> 01:01:22.485
On this tour, we've had
this really wonderful tradition


976
01:01:22.569 --> 01:01:24.821
that's kind of come about, where...

977
01:01:26.823 --> 01:01:29.159
And it started with you.
You guys were saying to me online,


978
01:01:29.242 --> 01:01:31.828
"I really want you to play older songs

979
01:01:31.911 --> 01:01:34.247
that you don't play very often."

980
01:01:37.292 --> 01:01:39.919
And so I was like, "Okay!"

981
01:01:40.545 --> 01:01:44.299
And so this tradition
kind of came about, and, uh...


982
01:01:44.883 --> 01:01:47.635
I'm really glad you told me to do that,
'cause it's really fun.


983
01:01:47.719 --> 01:01:49.137
It's super fun going back through

984
01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:51.306
and playing songs
I haven't played in forever.


985
01:01:51.806 --> 01:01:54.434
And-
- So this song is a song that--

986
01:01:55.143 --> 01:02:00.357
It's weird, because I feel like this song
has two lives to it in my brain.


987
01:02:00.523 --> 01:02:04.152
In my brain, there's
the life of this song

988
01:02:04.235 --> 01:02:10.367
where this song was born
out of catharsis and venting


989
01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:12.660
and trying to get over something

990
01:02:12.744 --> 01:02:14.704
and trying to understand it
and process it.


991
01:02:15.747 --> 01:02:18.541
And then there's the life
where it went out into the world


992
01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:22.670
and you turned this song into something
completely different for me.


993
01:02:22.796 --> 01:02:24.798
Um...

994
01:02:26.216 --> 01:02:29.719
You turned this song
into a collage of memories


995
01:02:29.803 --> 01:02:35.225
of watching you scream the words
to this song, or...


996
01:02:36.726 --> 01:02:39.813
...seeing pictures that you post to me
of you having written


997
01:02:39.896 --> 01:02:43.024
the words to this song in your diary,

998
01:02:43.108 --> 01:02:46.611
or you showing me your wrist,
and you have


999
01:02:46.694 --> 01:02:49.114
a tattoo of the lyrics to this song

1000
01:02:49.364 --> 01:02:50.657
underneath your skin.

1001
01:02:50.949 --> 01:02:53.993
And that is how you have changed
the song "All Too Well" for me.


1002
01:03:05.088 --> 01:03:07.757
<i>-</i> <i>I walked through the door with you</i>

1003
01:03:08.216 --> 01:03:10.051
<i>The air was cold</i>

1004
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:15.765
<i>But something 'bout it felt like home</i>
<i>Somehow and I</i>


1005
01:03:16.307 --> 01:03:20.019
<i>Left my scarf there</i>
<i>At your sister's house</i>


1006
01:03:20.103 --> 01:03:26.234
<i>And you've still got it</i>
<i>In your drawer even now</i>


1007
01:03:36.536 --> 01:03:41.666
<i>Oh, your sweet disposition</i>
<i>And my wide-eyed gaze</i>


1008
01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:46.921
<i>We're singing in the car</i>
<i>Getting lost upstate</i>


1009
01:03:47.464 --> 01:03:51.593
<i>The autumn leaves falling down</i>
<i>Like pieces into place</i>


1010
01:03:51.676 --> 01:03:57.432
<i>And I can picture it</i>
<i>After all these days</i>


1011
01:03:57.807 --> 01:03:59.684
<i>And I know it's long gone</i>

1012
01:03:59.767 --> 01:04:02.979
<i>And that magic's not here no more</i>

1013
01:04:03.062 --> 01:04:05.940
<i>And I might be okay, but I'm not</i>

1014
01:04:06.232 --> 01:04:12.864
<i>Fine at all</i>

1015
01:04:13.698 --> 01:04:18.203
<i>'Cause there we are again</i>
<i>On that little town street</i>


1016
01:04:18.995 --> 01:04:23.249
<i>You almost ran the red</i>
<i>'Cause you were looking over at me</i>


1017
01:04:23.333 --> 01:04:25.919
<i>Wind in my hair, 
I was there</i>

1018
01:04:26.002 --> 01:04:32.133
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1019
01:04:34.219 --> 01:04:36.846
<i>Photo album on the counter</i>

1020
01:04:37.222 --> 01:04:39.098
<i>Your cheeks were turning red</i>

1021
01:04:39.182 --> 01:04:44.687
<i>You used to be a little kid with glasses</i>
<i>In a twin-size bed</i>


1022
01:04:44.771 --> 01:04:49.275
<i>And your mother's telling stories</i>
<i>About you on a tee ball team</i>


1023
01:04:49.901 --> 01:04:54.072
<i>You tell me 'bout your past</i>
<i>Thinking your future was me</i>


1024
01:04:54.155 --> 01:04:56.574
<i>And I know it's long gone</i>

1025
01:04:56.658 --> 01:04:59.577
<i>And there was nothing else I could do</i>

1026
01:04:59.661 --> 01:05:02.205
<i>And I forget about you long enough</i>

1027
01:05:02.288 --> 01:05:09.003
<i>To forget why I needed to</i>

1028
01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:14.968
<i>'Cause there we are again</i>
<i>In the middle of the night</i>


1029
01:05:15.593 --> 01:05:19.889
<i>We dance around the kitchen</i>
<i>In the refrigerator light</i>


1030
01:05:19.973 --> 01:05:22.433
<i>Down the stairs, 
I was there</i>

1031
01:05:22.517 --> 01:05:28.773
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1032
01:05:30.567 --> 01:05:31.401
<i>Yeah</i>

1033
01:05:45.873 --> 01:05:48.960
<i>Well, maybe we got lost in translation</i>

1034
01:05:49.043 --> 01:05:51.379
<i>Maybe I asked for too much</i>

1035
01:05:51.462 --> 01:05:54.549
<i>But maybe this thing was a masterpiece</i>

1036
01:05:54.632 --> 01:05:56.676
<i>Till you tore it all up</i>

1037
01:05:56.759 --> 01:05:58.886
<i>Running scared, 
I was there</i>

1038
01:05:59.262 --> 01:06:00.805
<i>I remember it</i>

1039
01:06:01.222 --> 01:06:06.936
<i>All too well</i>

1040
01:06:07.145 --> 01:06:09.814
<i>Hey, you call me up again</i>

1041
01:06:09.897 --> 01:06:12.900
<i>Just to break me like a promise</i>

1042
01:06:12.984 --> 01:06:14.944
<i>So casually cruel</i>

1043
01:06:15.028 --> 01:06:17.864
<i>In the name of being honest</i>

1044
01:06:17.947 --> 01:06:22.201
<i>I'm a crumpled up piece of paper</i>
<i>Lying here</i>


1045
01:06:22.285 --> 01:06:25.163
<i>'Cause I remember it all</i>

1046
01:06:25.246 --> 01:06:29.125
<i>All, all</i>

1047
01:06:36.924 --> 01:06:38.801
<i>Too well</i>

1048
01:06:48.645 --> 01:06:53.566
<i>Time won't fly</i>
<i>It's like I'm paralyzed by it</i>


1049
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:58.655
<i>I'd like to be my old self again</i>
<i>But I'm still trying to find it</i>


1050
01:06:58.738 --> 01:07:04.118
<i>After plaid shirt days</i>
<i>And nights when you made me your own</i>


1051
01:07:04.535 --> 01:07:10.958
<i>Now you mail back my things</i>
<i>And I walk home alone</i>


1052
01:07:38.736 --> 01:07:43.241
<i>But you keep my old scarf</i>
<i>From that very first week</i>


1053
01:07:43.658 --> 01:07:48.121
<i>'Cause it reminds you of innocence</i>
<i>And it smells like me</i>


1054
01:07:48.204 --> 01:07:50.039
<i>You can't get rid of it</i>

1055
01:07:50.873 --> 01:07:56.295
<i>'Cause you remember it all too well</i>

1056
01:07:58.965 --> 01:08:03.594
<i>'Cause there we are again</i>
<i>When I loved you so</i>


1057
01:08:04.345 --> 01:08:05.722
<i>Back before you lost</i>

1058
01:08:06.055 --> 01:08:10.893
<i>The one real thing you've ever known</i>
<i>It was rare, I was there</i>


1059
01:08:11.227 --> 01:08:13.020
<i>I remember it</i>

1060
01:08:13.104 --> 01:08:17.775
<i>All too well</i>

1061
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:21.404
<i>Wind in my hair, you were there</i>

1062
01:08:21.487 --> 01:08:23.990
<i>You remember it all</i>

1063
01:08:24.073 --> 01:08:26.743
<i>Down the stairs, you were there</i>

1064
01:08:26.826 --> 01:08:29.537
<i>You remember it all</i>

1065
01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:32.206
<i>It was rare, 
I was there</i>

1066
01:08:32.665 --> 01:08:38.379
<i>I remember it all too well</i>

1067
01:08:51.601 --> 01:08:52.685
All right, of all the times

1068
01:08:52.769 --> 01:08:54.979
that I've heard that sung
incredibly loudly


1069
01:08:55.062 --> 01:08:58.649
I think tonight, Dallas,
at the end of this tour, our last night,


1070
01:08:58.733 --> 01:09:01.235
that was the loudest
I've ever heard that song.


1071
01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:08.993
And there was a huge,
bellowing chorus of singing


1072
01:09:09.076 --> 01:09:11.078
coming from this side of the stadium,

1073
01:09:11.162 --> 01:09:13.039
so I have to check it out.

1074
01:09:13.122 --> 01:09:15.458
I'm gonna come over and see you.
Here I come!


1075
01:10:16.727 --> 01:10:17.603
You ready?

1076
01:10:32.159 --> 01:10:34.620
<i>Nice to meet you, where you been?</i>

1077
01:10:34.704 --> 01:10:37.081
<i>I could show you incredible things</i>

1078
01:10:37.164 --> 01:10:39.542
<i>Magic, madness, heaven, sin</i>

1079
01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:41.544
<i>Saw you there and I thought</i>

1080
01:10:41.627 --> 01:10:44.005
<i>Oh, my God, look at that face</i>

1081
01:10:44.088 --> 01:10:46.424
<i>You look like my next mistake</i>

1082
01:10:46.507 --> 01:10:51.178
<i>Love’s a game, want to play?</i>

1083
01:10:52.263 --> 01:10:54.640
<i>New money, suit and tie</i>

1084
01:10:54.724 --> 01:10:57.101
<i>I can read you like a magazine</i>

1085
01:10:57.184 --> 01:10:59.645
<i>Ain't it funny, rumors lie</i>

1086
01:10:59.729 --> 01:11:01.689
<i>And I know you heard about me</i>

1087
01:11:01.772 --> 01:11:03.983
<i>So hey, let's be friends</i>

1088
01:11:04.066 --> 01:11:06.444
<i>I'm dying to see how this one ends</i>

1089
01:11:06.527 --> 01:11:08.905
<i>Grab your passport and my hand</i>

1090
01:11:08.988 --> 01:11:11.365
<i>I can make the bad guys</i>
<i>Good for a weekend</i>


1091
01:11:11.616 --> 01:11:13.826
<i>So it's gonna be forever</i>

1092
01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.287
<i>Or it's gonna go down in flames</i>

1093
01:11:16.829 --> 01:11:18.414
<i>You can tell me when it's over</i>

1094
01:11:19.498 --> 01:11:21.667
<i>If the high was worth the pain</i>

1095
01:11:21.792 --> 01:11:23.961
<i>I've got a long list of ex-lovers</i>

1096
01:11:24.337 --> 01:11:26.714
<i>They'll tell you I'm insane</i>

1097
01:11:26.797 --> 01:11:28.883
<i>'Cause you know I love the players</i>

1098
01:11:29.342 --> 01:11:32.011
<i>And you love the game</i>

1099
01:11:32.094 --> 01:11:33.721
<i>'Cause we're young and we're reckless</i>

1100
01:11:34.388 --> 01:11:36.682
<i>We'll take this way too far</i>

1101
01:11:36.766 --> 01:11:38.893
<i>It'll leave you breathless</i>

1102
01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:41.604
<i>Or with a nasty scar</i>

1103
01:11:41.896 --> 01:11:44.231
<i>Got a long list of ex-lovers</i>

1104
01:11:44.315 --> 01:11:46.859
<i>They'll tell you I'm insane</i>

1105
01:11:47.193 --> 01:11:50.029
<i>But I've got a blank space baby</i>

1106
01:11:50.571 --> 01:11:52.531
<i>And I'll write your name</i>

1107
01:11:57.119 --> 01:11:59.205
<i>Cherry lips, crystal skies</i>

1108
01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:02.041
<i>I could show you incredible things</i>

1109
01:12:02.124 --> 01:12:04.627
<i>Stolen kisses, pretty lies</i>

1110
01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:06.796
<i>You're the king, baby, 
I'm your queen</i>

1111
01:12:06.879 --> 01:12:08.589
<i>Find out what you want</i>

1112
01:12:09.006 --> 01:12:11.384
<i>Be that girl for a month</i>

1113
01:12:11.467 --> 01:12:15.388
<i>Wait, the worst is yet to come</i>

1114
01:12:15.471 --> 01:12:16.555
<i>Oh, no</i>

1115
01:12:17.139 --> 01:12:19.475
<i>Screaming, crying, perfect storm</i>

1116
01:12:19.558 --> 01:12:22.061
<i>I can make all the tables turn</i>

1117
01:12:22.144 --> 01:12:24.438
<i>Rose garden filled with thorns</i>

1118
01:12:24.522 --> 01:12:29.026
<i>Keep you second-guessing like</i>
<i>"Oh, my God, who is she?"</i>


1119
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:31.362
<i>I get drunk on jealousy</i>

1120
01:12:31.445 --> 01:12:33.864
<i>But you'll come back</i>
<i>Each time you leave</i>


1121
01:12:33.948 --> 01:12:36.367
<i>'Cause darling I'm a nightmare</i>
<i>Dressed like a daydream</i>


1122
01:12:36.826 --> 01:12:38.744
<i>So it's gonna be forever</i>

1123
01:12:39.370 --> 01:12:41.539
<i>Or it's gonna go down in flames</i>

1124
01:12:41.914 --> 01:12:43.833
<i>You can tell me when it's over</i>

1125
01:12:44.417 --> 01:12:46.377
<i>If the high was worth the pain</i>

1126
01:12:46.877 --> 01:12:48.963
<i>Got a long list of ex-lovers</i>

1127
01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:51.424
<i>They'll tell you I'm insane</i>

1128
01:12:51.924 --> 01:12:54.260
<i>'Cause you know I love the players</i>

1129
01:12:54.343 --> 01:12:56.637
<i>And you love the game</i>

1130
01:12:57.013 --> 01:12:58.973
<i>'Cause we're young and we're reckless</i>

1131
01:12:59.432 --> 01:13:01.517
<i>We'll take this way too far</i>

1132
01:13:01.851 --> 01:13:04.061
<i>It'll leave you breathless</i>

1133
01:13:04.395 --> 01:13:06.564
<i>Or with a nasty scar</i>

1134
01:13:06.897 --> 01:13:08.899
<i>Got a long list of ex-lovers</i>

1135
01:13:09.316 --> 01:13:11.485
<i>They'll tell you I'm insane</i>

1136
01:13:12.111 --> 01:13:15.072
<i>But I've got a blank space, baby</i>

1137
01:13:15.406 --> 01:13:17.491
<i>And I'll write your name</i>

1138
01:13:21.871 --> 01:13:26.751
<i>Boys only want love if it's torture</i>

1139
01:13:26.834 --> 01:13:31.630
<i>Don't say I didn't</i>
<i>Say I didn't warn ya</i>


1140
01:13:32.131 --> 01:13:36.594
<i>Boys only want love if it's torture</i>

1141
01:13:36.886 --> 01:13:41.891
<i>Don't say I didn't</i>
<i>Say I didn't warn ya</i>


1142
01:13:41.974 --> 01:13:44.018
<i>So it's gonna be forever</i>

1143
01:13:44.435 --> 01:13:46.395
<i>Or it's gonna go down in flames</i>

1144
01:13:46.771 --> 01:13:48.647
<i>You can tell me when it's over</i>

1145
01:13:49.356 --> 01:13:51.609
<i>If the high was worth the pain</i>

1146
01:13:51.817 --> 01:13:54.236
<i>Got a long list of ex-lovers</i>

1147
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.781
<i>They'll tell you I'm insane</i>

1148
01:13:56.864 --> 01:13:59.158
<i>'Cause you know I love the players</i>

1149
01:13:59.241 --> 01:14:01.702
<i>And you love the game</i>

1150
01:14:01.786 --> 01:14:03.954
<i>'Cause we're young and we're reckless</i>

1151
01:14:04.371 --> 01:14:06.415
<i>We'll take this way too far</i>

1152
01:14:06.957 --> 01:14:08.876
<i>It'll leave you breathless</i>

1153
01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:11.879
<i>Or with a nasty scar</i>

1154
01:14:11.962 --> 01:14:14.131
<i>Got a long list of ex-lovers</i>

1155
01:14:14.215 --> 01:14:16.675
<i>They'll tell you I'm insane</i>

1156
01:14:17.093 --> 01:14:20.096
<i>But I've got a blank space, baby</i>

1157
01:14:20.471 --> 01:14:22.640
<i>And I'll write your name</i>

1158
01:14:42.701 --> 01:14:43.536
So...

1159
01:14:46.413 --> 01:14:48.415
as I was walking through the crowd,

1160
01:14:49.041 --> 01:14:51.043
I could not help but notice...

1161
01:14:51.961 --> 01:14:54.088
Here we are
on the last night of the tour,


1162
01:14:55.131 --> 01:14:57.049
and you guys did not come to play.

1163
01:14:57.133 --> 01:15:01.512
You did not come
in regular outfits tonight.


1164
01:15:01.595 --> 01:15:03.472
You are in ensembles,

1165
01:15:04.014 --> 01:15:05.975
you are in costumes,

1166
01:15:06.892 --> 01:15:10.855
you're, like, wearing crowns,
with snakes around your neck,


1167
01:15:10.938 --> 01:15:13.482
with your face covered in glitter,

1168
01:15:13.566 --> 01:15:15.317
with lyrics all over your arms,

1169
01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:17.194
with 13s on your hands...

1170
01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.992
You guys are absolutely,
absolutely incredible,


1171
01:15:23.075 --> 01:15:25.578
and I'm really feeling like
I need to get on your level.


1172
01:15:26.162 --> 01:15:28.122
Because you guys seem to be dressing...

1173
01:15:29.331 --> 01:15:32.376
in correspondence with lyrics
of the songs.


1174
01:15:32.459 --> 01:15:34.170
Am I correct about that?

1175
01:15:34.545 --> 01:15:37.214
Yes. So...

1176
01:15:38.132 --> 01:15:40.050
I think what I should do now...

1177
01:15:41.594 --> 01:15:42.970
is wear a dress...

1178
01:15:43.846 --> 01:15:45.764
to play a song called "Dress."

1179
01:15:45.848 --> 01:15:47.308
What do we think about that?

1180
01:15:51.061 --> 01:15:54.440
<i>Our secret moments in a crowded room</i>

1181
01:15:54.899 --> 01:15:58.360
<i>They've got no idea about me and you</i>

1182
01:15:58.944 --> 01:16:00.654
<i>There is an indentation</i>

1183
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:02.448
<i>In the shape of you</i>

1184
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:06.285
<i>Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo</i>

1185
01:16:06.368 --> 01:16:10.122
<i>All of this silence and patience</i>
<i>Pining in anticipation</i>


1186
01:16:10.206 --> 01:16:14.043
<i>My hands are shaking</i>
<i>From holding back from you, ah, ah, ah</i>


1187
01:16:14.126 --> 01:16:18.088
<i>All of this silence and patience</i>
<i>Pining and desperately waiting</i>


1188
01:16:18.172 --> 01:16:20.174
<i>My hands are shaking from all this</i>

1189
01:16:20.257 --> 01:16:23.636
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah-ah</i>

1190
01:16:23.719 --> 01:16:27.139
<i>Say my name and everything just stops</i>

1191
01:16:27.723 --> 01:16:30.351
<i>I don't want you like a best friend</i>

1192
01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.897
<i>Only bought this dress</i>
<i>So you could take it off</i>


1193
01:16:35.272 --> 01:16:38.859
<i>Take it off, ah, ah, ah-ah</i>

1194
01:16:39.610 --> 01:16:42.780
<i>Carve your name into my bedpost</i>

1195
01:16:43.614 --> 01:16:46.408
<i>'Cause I don't want you</i>
<i>Like a best friend</i>


1196
01:16:47.451 --> 01:16:50.996
<i>Only bought this dress</i>
<i>So you could take it off</i>


1197
01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:54.792
<i>Take it off, ah, ah, ah-ah</i>

1198
01:16:55.125 --> 01:16:58.587
<i>Inescapable, 
I’m not even going to try</i>

1199
01:16:59.088 --> 01:17:02.341
<i>And if I get burned</i>
<i>At least we were electrified</i>


1200
01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.426
<i>I'm spilling wine in the bathtub</i>

1201
01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.553
<i>You kiss my face and we're both drunk</i>

1202
01:17:06.637 --> 01:17:10.057
<i>Everyone thinks that they know us</i>
<i>But they know nothing about</i>


1203
01:17:10.349 --> 01:17:14.061
<i>All of this silence and patience</i>
<i>Pining in anticipation</i>


1204
01:17:14.144 --> 01:17:18.148
<i>My hands are shaking</i>
<i>From holding back from you, ah, ah, ah</i>


1205
01:17:18.274 --> 01:17:22.111
<i>All of this silence and patience</i>

<i>Halo, hiding my obsession</i>

1352
01:27:40.812 --> 01:27:46.026
<i>I once was poison ivy</i>
<i>But now I'm your daisy</i>


1353
01:27:46.651 --> 01:27:51.364
<i>And baby, for you</i>
<i>I would fall from grace</i>


1354
01:27:51.698 --> 01:27:54.701
<i>Just to touch your face</i>

1355
01:27:55.118 --> 01:27:58.997
<i>If you walk away</i>

1356
01:27:59.372 --> 01:28:02.292
<i>I'd beg you on my knees to stay</i>

1357
01:28:02.918 --> 01:28:05.337
<i>Don't blame me, love made me crazy</i>

1358
01:28:05.420 --> 01:28:08.131
<i>If it doesn't</i>
<i>You ain't doin' it right</i>


1359
01:28:09.674 --> 01:28:12.344
<i>Lord, save me, my drug is my baby</i>

1360
01:28:12.427 --> 01:28:15.347
<i>I'll be usin' for
the rest of my life</i>

1361
01:28:16.723 --> 01:28:19.267
<i>Don't blame me, love made me crazy</i>

1362

<i>Oh, Lord, save me,

01:28:26.399 --> 01:28:29.361
<i>I'll be usin' for
the rest of my life</i>

1365
01:28:29.444 --> 01:28:31.988
<i>I get so high, oh</i>

1366
01:28:32.072 --> 01:28:34.991
<i>Every time, yeah</i>
<i>Every time you're lovin' me</i>

01:29:46.104 --> 01:29:48.815
<i>If it doesn't</i>
<i>You ain't doin' it right</i>


1383
01:29:48.982 --> 01:29:53.069
<i>-</i> <i>Doin' it right, no</i>
<i>- Lord, save me, my drug is my baby</i>


1384
01:29:53.153 --> 01:29:55.613
<i>I'll be usin' for

01:29:56.072 --> 01:29:57.282

<i>Doin' doin' it right</i>

1389
01:30:04.497 --> 01:30:07.083

1391
01:30:10.253 --> 01:30:11.838

1392
01:30:11.921 --> 01:30:15.341
<i>Oh, every time, yeah</i>

1393
01:30:16.217 --> 01:30:19.054

1394
01:30:19.304 --> 01:30:23.475
<i>Oh, oh, oh</i>

1395
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:26.686
<i>I get so high, oh</i>

1396
01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:29.731
<i>Every time, yeah</i>
<i>Every time you're loving me</i>


1397
01:30:32.067 --> 01:30:35.070
<i>Oh, Lord, save me</i>
<i>My drug is my baby</i>


1398
01:30:35.153 --> 01:30:38.490
<i>I'll be usin' for
the rest of my life</i>

1399
01:31:11.815 --> 01:31:13.108
So, you guys...

1400
01:31:15.944 --> 01:31:17.237
I know that, uh...

1401
01:31:18.279 --> 01:31:20.698
when you meet people,
when you first hang out with people,


1402
01:31:20.782 --> 01:31:22.367
you're supposed to play it cool,

1403
01:31:22.784 --> 01:31:25.036
be sort of casual and just be like,

1404
01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:27.455
"Yeah, I'm having a good time with you.
You guys seem cool."


1405
01:31:27.539 --> 01:31:29.791
But seriously,
this is such an incredible crowd,


1406
01:31:29.874 --> 01:31:31.793
I absolutely adore you.

1407
01:31:32.377 --> 01:31:35.922
I loved you as soon as
I heard you screaming.


1408
01:31:43.221 --> 01:31:46.349
So we started this
tour in May, and um...

1409
01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:49.978
honestly, I have never
experienced a tour...


1410
01:31:51.104 --> 01:31:54.524
that seemed to fly past this quickly.

1411
01:31:54.607 --> 01:31:56.943
'Cause we're having so much fun
on this tour.


1412
01:31:57.026 --> 01:31:59.279
We're having so much fun with you guys.

1413
01:32:00.071 --> 01:32:02.323
I can't even tell you how much.

1414
01:32:07.078 --> 01:32:09.372
So, when I say "we," I mean...

1415
01:32:10.999 --> 01:32:14.252
all of the people that you see
on the stage with me:


1416
01:32:14.335 --> 01:32:17.589
the dancers, the backup singers, the band,

1417
01:32:17.672 --> 01:32:21.134
everybody who you see up here with me.
Um...


1418
01:32:22.468 --> 01:32:26.222
Camila, Charli,
all these wonderful, incredible,


1419
01:32:26.764 --> 01:32:29.726
iconic people I get to be onstage with.

1420
01:32:32.353 --> 01:32:34.397
We've all dreamed about being
on a stage like this


1421
01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:36.149
since we were little kids.

1422
01:32:36.232 --> 01:32:39.027
And I think when we were little kids,
I think I can speak for all of us


1423
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:43.489
and say I don't think we ever imagined
we'd be on stages this big


1424
01:32:43.573 --> 01:32:44.908
with crowds this incredible.

1425
01:32:44.991 --> 01:32:47.619
I think this has sort of exceeded
any kind of...


1426
01:32:47.702 --> 01:32:49.871
...daydream.

1427
01:32:54.083 --> 01:32:55.043
But so...

1428
01:32:55.376 --> 01:32:58.296
we get to be out here with you
every single night on this stage,


1429
01:32:58.379 --> 01:32:59.589
but that is...

1430
01:33:00.924 --> 01:33:03.968
I mean, that is nothing compared to

1431
01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:08.556
the effort and the work
that has gone into building this stage.


1432
01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:13.603
We have 368 people
who travel with us around the world,


1433
01:33:13.686 --> 01:33:15.480
leave their families behind,

1434
01:33:15.563 --> 01:33:18.149
drive trucks, help put up the steel,

1435
01:33:18.233 --> 01:33:20.860
help build the stage, help do lighting,

1436
01:33:21.611 --> 01:33:24.447
sound, you name it.

1437
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:28.117
Tuning our instruments,
just helping us get to the place,


1438
01:33:28.201 --> 01:33:31.704
to the point where we can get up here
and do what we love to do.


1439
01:33:31.788 --> 01:33:34.749
On top of that, 
Dallas and Arlington,

1440
01:33:34.832 --> 01:33:40.004
this area provided us with 3,200 people

1441
01:33:40.088 --> 01:33:44.217
who did security for us,
who sold food, who did parking,


1442
01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:45.718
who helped us build this,

1443
01:33:45.802 --> 01:33:48.680
who will take this apart with us
after the show.


1444
01:33:50.139 --> 01:33:52.725
They're the people who will help
sweep up the glitter


1445
01:33:52.809 --> 01:33:55.144
when we all go home. Um...

1446
01:33:55.395 --> 01:33:56.479
And so...

1447
01:33:57.188 --> 01:33:59.816
I wanna say thank you
to every single person


1448
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:02.443
who has helped us
put on this stage tonight,


1449
01:34:02.527 --> 01:34:04.737
and especially security here,
for keeping us safe.


1450
01:34:05.113 --> 01:34:06.489
Thank you so much to everyone.

1451
01:34:06.572 --> 01:34:09.534
Let's hear a round of applause
for everyone who helped us do this.


1452
01:34:20.586 --> 01:34:24.549
And then, of course, um,
there really wouldn't be a show to put on


1453
01:34:24.632 --> 01:34:27.635
or a stage to
put up if you guys...

1454
01:34:28.303 --> 01:34:31.472
didn't wanna come be at the show.

1455
01:34:32.765 --> 01:34:33.850
So...

1456
01:34:37.145 --> 01:34:38.813
this is a song that, for me,

1457
01:34:39.939 --> 01:34:44.569
is always gonna be about you.

1458
01:34:44.652 --> 01:34:47.447
<i>I said remember this moment</i>

1459
01:34:49.324 --> 01:34:51.617
<i>In the back of my mind</i>

1460
01:34:53.286 --> 01:34:56.289
<i>The time we stood</i>
<i>With our shaking hands</i>


1461
01:34:56.372 --> 01:34:59.584
<i>The crowds in stands went wild</i>

1462
01:35:01.294 --> 01:35:04.130
<i>We were the kings and the queens</i>

1463
01:35:05.965 --> 01:35:08.301
<i>And they read off our names</i>

1464
01:35:09.844 --> 01:35:12.805
<i>The night you danced</i>
<i>Like you knew our lives</i>


1465
01:35:12.889 --> 01:35:16.434
<i>Would never be the same</i>

1466
01:35:18.186 --> 01:35:20.897
<i>You held your head like a hero</i>

1467
01:35:22.690 --> 01:35:25.026
<i>On a history book page</i>

1468
01:35:26.652 --> 01:35:29.322
<i>It was the end of a decade</i>

1469
01:35:30.990 --> 01:35:33.368
<i>But the start of an age</i>

1470
01:35:36.329 --> 01:35:39.540
<i>Long live the walls we crashed through</i>

1471
01:35:39.624 --> 01:35:43.836
<i>All the kingdom lights shined</i>
<i>Just for me and you</i>


1472
01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:47.840
<i>I was screaming</i>
<i>"Long live all the magic we made"</i>


1473
01:35:48.383 --> 01:35:53.012
<i>Bring on all the pretenders</i>
<i>I'm not afraid</i>


1474
01:35:53.679 --> 01:35:56.599
<i>Long live all the mountains we moved</i>

1475
01:35:56.682 --> 01:35:58.935
<i>I had the time of my life</i>

1476
01:35:59.268 --> 01:36:01.354
<i>Fighting dragons with you</i>

1477
01:36:01.437 --> 01:36:05.441
<i>I was screaming</i>
<i>"Long live that look at your face"</i>


1478
01:36:05.525 --> 01:36:08.152
<i>Bring on all the pretenders</i>

1479
01:36:08.444 --> 01:36:11.989
<i>One day we will be remembered</i>

1480
01:36:15.952 --> 01:36:19.664
<i>Hold on to spinning around</i>

1481
01:36:19.747 --> 01:36:23.918
<i>Confetti falls to the ground</i>

1482
01:36:24.001 --> 01:36:30.049
<i>May these memories break our fall</i>

1483
01:36:32.718 --> 01:36:34.512
<i>And hold on</i>

1484
01:36:36.931 --> 01:36:38.766
<i>To spinning around</i>

1485
01:36:42.353 --> 01:36:44.730
<i>Confetti</i>

1486
01:36:46.441 --> 01:36:48.234
<i>Falls to the ground</i>

1487
01:36:54.866 --> 01:36:57.869
<i>There's glitter on the floor</i>
<i>After the party</i>


1488
01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:02.707
<i>Girls carrying their shoes</i>
<i>Down in the lobby</i>


1489
01:37:04.542 --> 01:37:08.171
<i>Candle wax and Polaroids</i>
<i>On the hardwood floor</i>


1490
01:37:09.464 --> 01:37:12.300
<i>You and me from the night before, but</i>

1491
01:37:12.383 --> 01:37:17.263
<i>Don’t read the last page</i>

1492
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:19.640
<i>But I stay</i>

1493
01:37:19.724 --> 01:37:22.602
<i>When you're lost and I'm scared</i>
<i>And you’re turning away</i>


1494
01:37:22.685 --> 01:37:27.648
<i>I want your midnights</i>

1495
01:37:27.732 --> 01:37:31.903
<i>I'll be cleaning up bottles with you</i>
<i>On New Year's Day</i>


1496
01:37:35.364 --> 01:37:38.868
<i>You squeeze my hand three times</i>
<i>In the back of the taxi</i>


1497
01:37:40.453 --> 01:37:43.456
<i>I can tell</i>
<i>That it's gonna be a long road</i>


1498
01:37:45.458 --> 01:37:48.377
<i>I'll be there if you're the toast</i>

<i>When she fell, she fell apart.</i>

1540
01:42:15.436 --> 01:42:18.522
<i>Cracked her bones on the pavement</i>
<i>she once decorated as a child</i>


1541
01:42:18.606 --> 01:42:20.149
<i>with sidewalk chalk</i>

1542
01:42:20.983 --> 01:42:23.778
<i>When she crashed,</i>
<i>her clothes disintegrated</i>


1543
01:42:24.111 --> 01:42:28.365
<i>and blew away with the winds</i>
<i>that took all of her fair-weather friends</i>


1544
01:42:28.699 --> 01:42:31.535
<i>When she looked around,</i>
<i>her skin was spattered with ink</i>


1545
01:42:32.077 --> 01:42:33.913
<i>forming the words of a thousand voices,</i>

1546
01:42:33.996 --> 01:42:36.290
<i>Echoes she heard even in her sleep:</i>

1547
01:42:37.208 --> 01:42:39.251
<i>"Whatever you say, it is not right."</i>

1548
01:42:39.335 --> 01:42:41.545
<i>"Whatever you do, it is not enough."</i>

1549
01:42:42.004 --> 01:42:43.714
<i>"Your kindness is fake."</i>

1550
01:42:44.173 --> 01:42:46.217
<i>"Your pain is manipulative."</i>

1551
01:42:47.134 --> 01:42:49.011
<i>When she lay there on the ground,</i>

1552
01:42:49.094 --> 01:42:52.473
<i>She dreamed of time machines and revenge</i>

1553
01:42:52.556 --> 01:42:54.809
<i>and a love that was really something,</i>

1554
01:42:55.810 --> 01:42:58.145
<i>Not just the idea of something.</i>

1555
01:42:59.396 --> 01:43:02.107
<i>When she finally rose, she rose slowly</i>

1556
01:43:02.608 --> 01:43:06.195
<i>Avoiding old haunts</i>
<i>and sidestepping shiny pennies</i>


1557
01:43:06.904 --> 01:43:09.615
<i>Wary of phone calls and promises,</i>

1558
01:43:09.907 --> 01:43:13.828
<i>Charmers, dandies</i>
<i>and get-love-quick-schemes</i>


1559
01:43:15.579 --> 01:43:18.791
<i>When she stood,</i>
<i>she stood with a desolate knowingness</i>


1560
01:43:18.874 --> 01:43:22.127
<i>Waded out into the dark,</i>
<i>wild ocean up to her neck</i>


1561
01:43:22.628 --> 01:43:24.463
<i>Bathed in her brokenness</i>

1562
01:43:29.718 --> 01:43:31.387
<i>Said a prayer of gratitude</i>

1563
01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:34.682
<i>for each chink in the armor</i>
<i>she never knew she needed</i>


1564
01:43:35.641 --> 01:43:37.226
<i>Standing broad-shouldered next to her</i>

1565
01:43:37.309 --> 01:43:39.937
<i>was a love that was really something,</i>

1566
01:43:40.396 --> 01:43:42.690
<i>not just the idea of something.</i>

1567
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:46.068
<i>When she turned to go home,</i>

1568
01:43:46.485 --> 01:43:48.571
<i>She heard the echoes of new words</i>

1569
01:43:49.822 --> 01:43:51.699
<i>"May your heart remain breakable</i>

1570
01:43:51.782 --> 01:43:54.118
<i>But never by the same hand twice"</i>

1571
01:43:54.827 --> 01:43:56.287
<i>And even louder:</i>

1572
01:43:56.370 --> 01:43:58.163
<i>"without your past,</i>

1573
01:43:58.247 --> 01:44:01.959
<i>you could never have arrived--</i>
<i>so wondrously and brutally,</i>


1574
01:44:02.459 --> 01:44:06.672
<i>By design or some violent,</i>
<i>exquisite happenstance</i>


1575
01:44:07.965 --> 01:44:09.049
<i>...here."</i>

1576
01:44:11.969 --> 01:44:14.889
<i>No, nothing good starts</i>
<i>In a getaway car</i>


1577
01:44:14.972 --> 01:44:17.558
<i>He was the best of times</i>
<i>The worst of crimes</i>


1578
01:44:17.641 --> 01:44:20.019
<i>I struck a match and blew your mind</i>

1579
01:44:20.102 --> 01:44:21.562
<i>But I didn't mean it</i>

1580
01:44:22.855 --> 01:44:24.607
<i>And you didn’t see it</i>

1581
01:44:26.358 --> 01:44:28.652
<i>The ties were black</i>
<i>The lies were white</i>


1582
01:44:29.069 --> 01:44:32.781
<i>And shades of gray in candlelight</i>
<i>I wanted to leave him</i>


1583
01:44:33.949 --> 01:44:35.868
<i>I needed a reason</i>

1584

<i>X marks the spot where we fell apart</i>

1585
01:44:40.247 --> 01:44:42.750
<i>He poisoned the well</i>
<i>I was lyin' to myself</i>


1586
01:44:42.833 --> 01:44:45.419
<i>I knew it from the first Old Fashioned</i>
<i>We were cursed</i>


1587
01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:48.047
<i>We never had a shotgun shot</i>

1588

01:44:51.050 --> 01:44:53.928
<i>We were flyin’, but we'd never get far</i>

1590
01:44:54.637 --> 01:44:56.889
<i>Don't pretend it's such a mystery</i>

1591
01:44:56.972 --> 01:44:59.391
<i>Think about the place</i>

<i>We were ridin' in a getaway car</i>

1593

<i>No, nothing good starts</i>
<i>In a getaway car</i>


1599
01:45:22.081 --> 01:45:24.583
<i>It was the great escape</i>
<i>The prison break</i>


1600
01:45:24.833 --> 01:45:28.837
<i>The light of freedom on my face</i>
<i>But you weren’t thinkin’</i>


1601
01:45:29.755 --> 01:45:31.674
<i>And I was just drinkin'</i>

1602
01:45:33.258 --> 01:45:36.345
<i>While he was runnin’ after us</i>
<i>I was screamin', "Go, go, go!"</i>


1603
01:45:36.428 --> 01:45:38.847
<i>But with three of us, honey</i>
<i>It's a sideshow</i>


1604
01:45:39.306 --> 01:45:41.016
<i>And a circus ain't a love story</i>

1605
01:45:41.308 --> 01:45:44.144
<i>-</i><i>And now we’re both sorry</i>
<i>-</i><i>We're both sorry</i>

1729
01:53:28.233 --> 01:53:30.485
<i>Bass beat rattling the chandelier</i>

1730

<i>Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year</i>

1731

<i>So why'd you have to rain</i>
<i>On my parade?</i>


1732
01:53:40.954 --> 01:53:42.831
<i>I'm shaking my head</i>

<i>I'm locking the gates</i>

1734
01:53:46.042 --> 01:53:50.005
<i>This is why we can't have nice things</i>

1735
01:53:50.338 --> 01:53:52.632
<i>Darlin'</i>

1736
01:53:53.842 --> 01:53:57.387
<i>Because you break them</i>
<i>I had to take them away</i>

<i>This is why we can't have nice things</i>

<i>Honey, oh</i>

1739
01:54:05.145 --> 01:54:08.982
<i>Did you think I wouldn't hear</i>
<i>All the things you said about me?</i>


1740
01:54:09.065 --> 01:54:12.194
- <i>This is why we can't have</i>
<i>- Nice things</i>


1741
01:54:12.986 --> 01:54:14.070
<i>Whoo-ooh!</i>

1742
01:54:14.154 --> 01:54:16.907
<i>It was so nice being friends again</i>

1743
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:19.659
<i>There I was giving you a second chance</i>

1744
01:54:19.743 --> 01:54:24.372
<i>But you stabbed me in the back</i>
<i>While shaking my hand</i>


1745
01:54:24.456 --> 01:54:25.665
<i>Whoo-ooh!</i>

1746
01:54:25.749 --> 01:54:28.543
<i>And therein lies the issue</i>
<i>Friends don't try to trick you</i>


1747
01:54:28.627 --> 01:54:31.421
<i>Get you on the phone</i>
<i>And mind-twist you</i>


1748
01:54:31.505 --> 01:54:35.467
<i>And so I took an
ax to a mended fence</i>

1749
01:54:36.343 --> 01:54:41.556
<i>But I'm not the only friend</i>
<i>You've lost lately, mm-mm</i>


1750
01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:43.600
<i>If only you weren't</i>

1751
01:54:44.184 --> 01:54:46.186
<i>So shady</i>

1752
01:54:46.686 --> 01:54:50.315

01:55:20.387 --> 01:55:22.806
<i>He ain't reading</i>
<i>What they call me lately</i>


1763
01:55:23.223 --> 01:55:25.892
<i>And here's to my momma</i>

1764
01:55:26.142 --> 01:55:28.645
<i>Had to listen to all this drama</i>

1765
01:55:28.728 --> 01:55:31.189
<i>And here's to you</i>

1766

01:57:18.588 --> 01:57:21.049
<i>- Oh</i>
-Make some noise for the singers, Dallas!


1790
01:57:21.132 --> 01:57:24.761
<i>Here's a toast to my real friends</i>

1791
01:57:30.558 --> 01:57:31.768
<i>Uh-uh</i>

1792
01:57:31.851 --> 01:57:33.228
<i>Oh, no</i>

1793
01:57:36.231 --> 01:57:37.148
<i>Uh-uh</i>

1794
01:57:37.649 --> 01:57:38.900
<i>Oh, no</i>

1795
01:57:41.945 --> 01:57:43.071
<i>Uh-uh</i>

1796
01:57:43.154 --> 01:57:44.823
<i>-</i>Give it up for the band.
<i>- Oh, no</i>


1797
01:57:44.906 --> 01:57:46.825
<i>
- Baby</i>

1798
01:57:53.581 --> 01:57:54.624
<i>Uh-uh</i>

1799
01:57:54.999 --> 01:57:56.418
<i>Oh, no</i>

1800
01:57:59.379 --> 01:58:00.588
<i>Uh-uh</i>

1801
01:58:00.839 --> 01:58:02.090
<i>Oh, no</i>

1802
01:58:05.135 --> 01:58:06.428
<i>Uh-uh</i>

1803
01:58:06.511 --> 01:58:07.929
<i>Oh, no</i>

1804
01:58:08.012 --> 01:58:09.222
<i>Baby</i>

1805
01:58:14.936 --> 01:58:16.813
<i>This is why we can't have</i>

1806
01:58:16.896 --> 01:58:18.189
<i>Uh-uh</i>

1807
01:58:18.273 --> 01:58:19.607
<i>Oh, no</i>

1808
01:58:19.691 --> 01:58:20.942
<i>Baby</i>

1809
01:58:26.489 --> 01:58:27.824
<i>This is why we can't have</i>

1810
01:58:28.324 --> 01:58:29.284
<i>Uh-uh</i>

1811
01:58:29.743 --> 01:58:30.994
<i>Oh, no</i>

1812
01:58:32.370 --> 01:58:34.080
<i>This is why we can't have</i>

1813
01:58:34.164 --> 01:58:35.206
<i>Uh-uh</i>

1814
01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:36.750
<i>Oh, no</i>

1815
01:59:01.191 --> 01:59:03.067
<i>This is why we can't have</i>

1816
01:59:03.151 --> 01:59:04.194
<i>Uh-uh</i>

1817
01:59:04.569 --> 01:59:05.695
<i>Oh, no</i>

1818
01:59:05.779 --> 01:59:07.071
<i>Baby</i>

1819
01:59:12.952 --> 01:59:14.537
<i>This is why we can't have</i>

1820
01:59:14.621 --> 01:59:17.123
<i>Uh-uh, uh-uh</i>

1821
01:59:17.415 --> 01:59:18.666
<i>Oh, no</i>

1822
01:59:18.750 --> 01:59:22.212
<i>Oh, no</i>

1823
01:59:22.837 --> 01:59:25.423
<i>No</i>

1824
02:00:13.930 --> 02:00:16.140
<i>See you in the dark</i>

1825
02:00:17.058 --> 02:00:19.936
<i>All eyes on you, my magician</i>

1826
02:00:20.186 --> 02:00:22.188
<i>All eyes on us</i>

1827
02:00:23.439 --> 02:00:26.234
<i>You make everyone disappear, and</i>

1828
02:00:26.609 --> 02:00:28.736
<i>Cut me into pieces</i>

1829
02:00:29.779 --> 02:00:32.949
<i>Gold cage, hostage to my feelings</i>

1830
02:00:33.449 --> 02:00:34.993
<i>Back against the wall</i>

1831
02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:38.705
<i>Trippin', trip-trippin'</i>
<i>When you're gone</i>


1832
02:00:38.788 --> 02:00:41.291
<i>'Cause we break down a little</i>

1833
02:00:41.624 --> 02:00:44.544
<i>But when you get me alone</i>
<i>It's so simple</i>


1834
02:00:44.836 --> 02:00:47.964
<i>'Cause, baby, 
I know what you know</i>

1835
02:00:48.339 --> 02:00:51.050
<i>We can feel it</i>

1836
02:00:51.217 --> 02:00:53.219
<i>And our pieces fall</i>

1837
02:00:54.596 --> 02:00:56.598
<i>Right into place</i>

1838
02:00:57.807 --> 02:01:00.560
<i>Get caught up in the moment</i>

1839
02:01:00.977 --> 02:01:02.979
<i>Lipstick on your face</i>

1840
02:01:03.062 --> 02:01:04.272
<i>So it goes</i>

1841
02:01:04.355 --> 02:01:06.107
<i>I'm yours to keep</i>

1842
02:01:07.483 --> 02:01:09.527
<i>And I'm yours to lose</i>

1843
02:01:10.486 --> 02:01:12.739
<i>You know I'm not
a bad girl, but I</i>

1844
02:01:13.406 --> 02:01:15.408
<i>Do bad things with you</i>

1845
02:01:15.909 --> 02:01:17.327
<i>So it goes</i>

1846
02:01:18.244 --> 02:01:19.913
<i>Met you in a bar</i>

1847
02:01:20.997 --> 02:01:22.582
<i>All eyes on me</i>

1848
02:01:22.665 --> 02:01:24.042
<i>Your illusion is</i>

1849
02:01:24.208 --> 02:01:26.544
<i>All eyes on us</i>

1850
02:01:27.378 --> 02:01:30.173
<i>I make all your gray days clear and</i>

1851
02:01:30.673 --> 02:01:32.926
<i>Wear you like a necklace</i>

1852
02:01:33.635 --> 02:01:36.971
<i>I'm so chill, but you make me jealous</i>

1853
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:38.973
<i>But I got your heart</i>

1854
02:01:40.058 --> 02:01:42.560
<i>Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone</i>

1855
02:01:42.644 --> 02:01:45.396
<i>'Cause we break down a little</i>

<i>It's so simple</i>


1857
02:01:48.900 --> 02:01:51.778
<i>'Cause, baby, 
I know what you know</i>

1858
02:01:52.153 --> 02:01:55.156

02:01:55.239 --> 02:01:57.533

02:02:08.461 --> 02:02:10.213
<i>I'm yours to keep</i>

1865

02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:32.402
<i>Do bad things with you</i>

1873
02:02:32.735 --> 02:02:34.153
<i>So it goes</i>

1874
02:02:34.612 --> 02:02:37.657
<i>Come here, dressed in black now</i>

1875
02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:40.201
<i>So, so, so it goes</i>

1876
02:02:40.868 --> 02:02:43.913
<i>Scratches down your back now</i>

1877
02:02:43.997 --> 02:02:46.958
<i>So, so, so it goes</i>

1878
02:02:47.792 --> 02:02:50.795
<i>You did a number on me</i>

1879
02:02:50.878 --> 02:02:53.631
<i>But honestly, baby, who's counting?</i>

1880
02:02:54.173 --> 02:02:57.135
<i>I did a number on you</i>

1881
02:02:57.218 --> 02:03:00.054
<i>But honestly, baby, who's counting?</i>

1882
02:03:00.638 --> 02:03:03.474
<i>You did a number on me</i>

1883
02:03:03.558 --> 02:03:06.519
<i>But honestly, baby, who's counting?</i>

1884
02:03:08.521 --> 02:03:09.981
<i>Who's counting?</i>

1885
02:03:10.898 --> 02:03:11.941
<i>One, two, three</i>

1886
02:03:12.025 --> 02:03:13.943
<i>And all the pieces fall...</i>

1887
02:03:14.068 --> 02:03:15.903
Okay, so, first of all--

1888
02:03:15.987 --> 02:03:17.572
First of all, um...

1889
02:03:18.573 --> 02:03:19.574
I don't--

1890
02:03:20.116 --> 02:03:23.036
I don't know.
I don't know what's going on.


1891
02:03:23.745 --> 02:03:24.662
Great drumming.

1892
02:03:25.371 --> 02:03:29.083
-Like my drums? I'm air-drumming.
-Cool. Amazing.


1893
02:03:29.208 --> 02:03:30.585
I've never seen it before.

1894
02:03:30.668 --> 02:03:32.587
-Really?
-Yeah, I'm back there.


1895
02:03:33.129 --> 02:03:34.172
-So--
-I'm just...


1896
02:03:34.255 --> 02:03:36.007
Hey!

1897
02:03:36.174 --> 02:03:38.801
This is one of the-
- It's-
- One, two--

1898
02:03:38.885 --> 02:03:42.055
I'm more of a... "Drummer! Drummer!"

1899
02:03:43.639 --> 02:03:44.557
Oh, no.

1900
02:03:45.641 --> 02:03:46.851
My costume change.

1901
02:03:47.226 --> 02:03:50.438
This is exactly-- This is what I do
when I don't know choreography.


1902
02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:53.608
-Yeah.
-Yeah.


1903
02:03:53.691 --> 02:03:55.693
-But, like--
-Yeah, the side?


1904
02:03:55.777 --> 02:03:57.403
-That's "I don't know my choreography."
-That's--


1905
02:03:57.779 --> 02:03:59.697
<i>Ah, what you made me do</i>

1906
02:03:59.781 --> 02:04:01.741
-Can we do it again? I missed all of it.
-Okay.


1907
02:04:01.824 --> 02:04:04.410
I just didn't even get on the train,
'cause it left the station.


1908
02:04:05.244 --> 02:04:07.038
- Need to--
- Oh! <i>Look what--</i>


1909
02:04:07.121 --> 02:04:10.291
There's too many-- The words are
all the same over and over again.


1910
02:04:10.374 --> 02:04:12.835
-And I know that's my fault. But--
-No, it's okay.


1911
02:04:13.628 --> 02:04:14.879
What's up?

1912
02:04:14.962 --> 02:04:17.632
You can't just put it in front of me
and not have me drink that.


1913
02:04:17.715 --> 02:04:18.925
It's an Old Fashioned.

1914
02:04:19.383 --> 02:04:22.095
I have to test it. 
It's my responsibility.

1915
02:04:22.178 --> 02:04:24.305
You think I could put on a stage
or serve these people


1916
02:04:24.388 --> 02:04:26.265
- something I haven't tested?
- It's good.


1917
02:04:26.599 --> 02:04:29.143
This is beyond the feat of engineering.

1918
02:04:30.269 --> 02:04:34.732
It's like a feat of magical mystique.

1919
02:04:35.149 --> 02:04:39.904
The amount of decking that we have
is equivalent to ten arena tours.


1920
02:04:39.987 --> 02:04:41.239
That's just decking.

1921
02:04:41.823 --> 02:04:43.783
-It's bigger than a 767.
-Oh, my God.


1922
02:04:43.866 --> 02:04:45.535
Wingspan, nose to tail.

1923
02:04:46.327 --> 02:04:48.246
-Oh, my God.
-Look at that.


1924
02:04:48.329 --> 02:04:50.957
-What's a 767?
-It's an airplane, a big one.


1925
02:04:51.833 --> 02:04:56.170
You guys are just gonna need to leave
little trails of candy to just get me


1926
02:04:56.254 --> 02:04:58.089
-to go to the right places.
-Little Reese's Pieces.


1927
02:04:58.965 --> 02:04:59.841
Nobody...

1928
02:05:00.925 --> 02:05:02.844
-What do you need?
-I was lost.


1929
02:05:03.469 --> 02:05:04.554
It's a big stage.

1930
02:05:04.637 --> 02:05:06.097
- You can go this way.
- Thanks.


1931
02:05:07.348 --> 02:05:09.851
Okay, I'm alone out here,
so I feel like I'm in the wrong place.


1932
02:05:10.518 --> 02:05:13.521
I really am gonna need
to study a map of this thing.


1933
02:05:13.604 --> 02:05:14.438
I know.

1934
02:05:14.522 --> 02:05:15.773
<i>So it goes</i>

1935
02:05:16.065 --> 02:05:19.193
<i>Scratches down your back now</i>

1936
02:05:19.277 --> 02:05:21.779
<i>So, so, so it goes</i>

1937
02:05:23.779 --> 02:05:25.779
