3
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.638
All right. You can go on in.
You know the way?


4
00:00:42.806 --> 00:00:44.265
- Yes, I do. Thank you.
- Okay.


5
00:00:44.432 --> 00:00:46.350
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.
I had car trouble again.


6
00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:48.060
Would you believe it?

7
00:01:19.342 --> 00:01:21.093
I'll think up something
for you tonight.


8
00:01:21.261 --> 00:01:22.887
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah. Bye-bye.


9
00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:12.014
Hey, Bill,
you left the lights on again.


10
00:04:12.182 --> 00:04:13.640
The dishes are on the table.

11
00:04:13.808 --> 00:04:16.018
The refrigerator door
was open.


12
00:04:16.186 --> 00:04:18.270
I hate this.
The whole place is a mess.


13
00:04:18.438 --> 00:04:19.897
Hi, Mom.

14
00:04:20.065 --> 00:04:23.275
- Hi.
- Hi.


15
00:04:25.236 --> 00:04:26.695
Any calls?

16
00:04:26.863 --> 00:04:28.405
No, your boyfriend did not call.

17
00:04:28.573 --> 00:04:31.367
- You sure?
- If he called, I'd tell you.


18
00:04:31.534 --> 00:04:33.202
Phone didn't ring.

19
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.038
How would you hear it if it did
with the radio going like this?


20
00:04:36.206 --> 00:04:38.040
I've got good ears.

21
00:04:43.004 --> 00:04:45.214
What's that all about?
Hmm?


22
00:04:45.382 --> 00:04:47.257
I don't know.

23
00:04:49.886 --> 00:04:51.261
What do you mean
you don't know?


24
00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:53.097
What's your school counselor
want to see me for?


25
00:04:53.264 --> 00:04:54.723
I don't know, Mom.

26
00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:59.019
Your halo's burning.

27
00:05:01.773 --> 00:05:03.232
Are you in trouble?

28
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.818
Look, Mom, believe me,
this is meaningless, okay?


29
00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:08.821
Just don't worry about it.
Throw it away.


30
00:05:08.988 --> 00:05:10.447
You going to come in soon?

31
00:05:10.615 --> 00:05:13.117
Yeah. I'm just gonna finish up.
I'll be in in a minute.


32
00:06:22.103 --> 00:06:23.562
Mom!

33
00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.815
- No, no, no! Oh, Billy!
- What? What?


34
00:06:26.983 --> 00:06:28.567
Billy.

35
00:06:28.735 --> 00:06:30.944
He's in the room!
Look around the room!


36
00:06:31.112 --> 00:06:33.155
- Who? Who?
- Look around the room!


37
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.783
Come here. Come here.

38
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:38.327
Mommy!

39
00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:40.329
Mommy, what happened?

40
00:06:40.497 --> 00:06:42.498
They're locked.
I'll look in the bathroom.


41
00:06:42.665 --> 00:06:43.999
- Mommy!
- What happened?


42
00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:45.584
- Mommy!
- Mommy!


43
00:06:45.752 --> 00:06:47.044
Look in the closet!

44
00:06:48.838 --> 00:06:51.215
Mommy.

45
00:06:51.382 --> 00:06:53.717
It's empty.

46
00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:56.720
- Look around the house!
- Mommy. Mommy.


47
00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:21.787
Mom.
Mom, there's nobody here.


48
00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:23.830
Call the police.
Call the police.


49
00:07:23.998 --> 00:07:25.832
Mom, there's no one
in the house.


50
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.627
The front door's locked.
No one came through the garage.


51
00:07:28.795 --> 00:07:30.254
You didn't see anybody?
You didn't hear anyone?


52
00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:32.047
No. Only when you screamed.

53
00:07:33.883 --> 00:07:36.176
Mom, you must have had
a bad dream, that's all.


54
00:07:38.012 --> 00:07:40.889
Come on, stop crying.

55
00:07:42.225 --> 00:07:44.935
Kim. Kimmy,
you've had bad dreams.


56
00:07:45.103 --> 00:07:46.853
Now Mommy's had one.
That's all.


57
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.983
I'm sorry.

58
00:07:52.944 --> 00:07:54.945
I'm sorry.

59
00:08:22.765 --> 00:08:24.600
- You okay, Mom?
- Sure.


60
00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.533
Bill! Ohh!

61
00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:48.744
- There's something coming!
- What?


62
00:10:48.911 --> 00:10:50.495
- We've got to get out of the house.
- What are you talking about?


63
00:10:50.663 --> 00:10:52.706
We've got to get the kids!

64
00:10:52.874 --> 00:10:54.916
Come on!

65
00:10:55.084 --> 00:10:56.251
- Come on.
- Come on, baby.


66
00:10:56.419 --> 00:10:57.753
Come on, baby.

67
00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.838
No. No. No.

68
00:11:00.006 --> 00:11:01.590
We've got to get out of the house.

69
00:11:01.758 --> 00:11:03.508
- What's happening?
- It's in my room.


70
00:11:03.676 --> 00:11:06.470
- What?
- Come on. Come on.


71
00:11:09.098 --> 00:11:12.184
Get her in the car.

72
00:11:12.351 --> 00:11:13.977
Here.

73
00:11:15.146 --> 00:11:17.105
- Oh, my God. The keys.
- I'll get 'em.


74
00:11:17.273 --> 00:11:18.648
No! Stay right here.
I'll be right back.


75
00:11:18.816 --> 00:11:20.859
Come on. Stop crying.
Stop crying.


76
00:11:21.027 --> 00:11:23.153
- Come on.
- Why are we leaving?


77
00:11:23.321 --> 00:11:24.738
Don't worry about it.
We're just going somewhere, all right?


78
00:11:24.906 --> 00:11:26.907
But we don't want to leave.

79
00:11:27.074 --> 00:11:29.493
I'm scared.

80
00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.037
Shh. Shh.

81
00:12:00.358 --> 00:12:03.193
Shit. Shit.

82
00:12:03.361 --> 00:12:05.153
Shit.

83
00:12:37.186 --> 00:12:41.690
Did you hear it?

84
00:12:41.858 --> 00:12:43.358
Hear what?

85
00:13:07.258 --> 00:13:10.093
I'll get some pillows
and some blankets.


86
00:13:10.261 --> 00:13:13.179
Billy, honey, can you help me?

87
00:13:14.849 --> 00:13:16.308
Ohh.

88
00:13:16.475 --> 00:13:18.310
Good.

89
00:13:21.272 --> 00:13:24.774
There. Now, let's see.
We'll put Julie over there


90
00:13:24.942 --> 00:13:26.443
and Kim and Mom here.

91
00:13:26.611 --> 00:13:28.862
And, oh, gosh, looks like
it's the floor for you, Bill.


92
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:30.488
Honey, you coming to bed or not?

93
00:13:30.656 --> 00:13:32.282
In a minute, George.

94
00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:33.867
Here, here, here.
Here, we'll take care of this.


95
00:13:34.035 --> 00:13:35.368
- What...
- You just...


96
00:13:35.536 --> 00:13:37.245
Listen. Thank you.

97
00:13:37.413 --> 00:13:38.914
Nonsense.

98
00:13:39.081 --> 00:13:41.124
What are good friends
for anyway, huh?


99
00:13:41.292 --> 00:13:43.543
Don't you be bashful,
because there's plenty of food


100
00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:46.546
in the refrigerator
for the morning, and...


101
00:13:46.714 --> 00:13:48.632
- Yeah.
- You know.


102
00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:50.133
Get a good night's sleep.

103
00:13:50.301 --> 00:13:52.135
- You too.
- All right. Night.


104
00:13:59.268 --> 00:14:00.769
You all right?

105
00:14:00.937 --> 00:14:02.437
Yeah, if you're all right.

106
00:14:05.691 --> 00:14:09.319
I don't understand, Mom.
I don't understand what's going on.


107
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.031
I don't either.

108
00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:17.994
Are you all right?

109
00:14:19.372 --> 00:14:21.790
Just go to sleep, okay?

110
00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:23.917
Just go to sleep.

111
00:14:58.327 --> 00:15:01.705
I've gotta find Captain Raccoon.
I have a telegram for him.


112
00:15:09.505 --> 00:15:11.256
Good morning!

113
00:15:11.424 --> 00:15:14.634
Carla, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.


114
00:15:14.802 --> 00:15:16.302
- Hi. How you doing?
- How'd you sleep?


115
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:17.721
- Great.
- Good.


116
00:15:17.888 --> 00:15:19.556
We helped ourselves to cereal,
and I made coffee.


117
00:15:19.724 --> 00:15:21.599
- Great. Love some.
- You want some? Okay.


118
00:15:21.767 --> 00:15:23.935
- Did you make it strong?
- Of course I made it strong.


119
00:15:24.103 --> 00:15:25.603
- What do you think?
- Good girl.


120
00:15:25.771 --> 00:15:27.313
- You want some milk and sugar?
- Yeah.


121
00:15:27.481 --> 00:15:29.399
- Okay.
- Okay.


122
00:15:30.568 --> 00:15:34.821
Hey, this is pretty nice,
being served in my own home.


123
00:15:34.989 --> 00:15:36.698
What about George and I?

124
00:15:36.866 --> 00:15:39.492
We keep you awake last night
with all our snoring and stuff?


125
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:40.994
- No.
- The kids?


126
00:15:41.162 --> 00:15:42.495
Anybody fall off the couch?

127
00:15:42.663 --> 00:15:44.581
No. They're used to it.

128
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.378
So...

129
00:15:50.546 --> 00:15:52.297
what happened to you guys
last night, anyway?


130
00:15:52.465 --> 00:15:54.758
Nothing.

131
00:15:54.925 --> 00:15:58.011
- You want one or two?
- Two, please. Thank you.


132
00:15:58.179 --> 00:16:00.346
Beautiful day outside,
isn't it?


133
00:16:00.514 --> 00:16:03.892
Nothing like good old Southern
California for lots of sunshine.


134
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.977
- I was raped.
- Yeah...


135
00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:09.355
- What?
- I was raped.


136
00:16:09.523 --> 00:16:11.858
Oh, Carla, baby.

137
00:16:12.026 --> 00:16:15.612
I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.


138
00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:17.530
Oh, my God.

139
00:16:17.698 --> 00:16:19.908
I feel all rotten inside.

140
00:16:20.076 --> 00:16:23.203
Ohh. How did it happen?

141
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.498
Um...

142
00:16:26.665 --> 00:16:30.335
well, I was alone
in my room, and...


143
00:16:31.837 --> 00:16:34.672
something grabbed me
and smothered me.


144
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.382
Did you call the police?

145
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.301
- No.
- Why?


146
00:16:38.469 --> 00:16:42.430
- There was no reason to.
- What do you mean?


147
00:16:42.598 --> 00:16:45.058
There was nobody there.

148
00:16:45.226 --> 00:16:47.143
Well, did you check the doors,
the windows?


149
00:16:47.311 --> 00:16:48.770
Yeah, I checked everything.
Everything was locked.


150
00:16:48.938 --> 00:16:50.355
There was nobody there.

151
00:16:50.523 --> 00:16:52.857
Oh, Carla. Oh, wait a minute.

152
00:16:53.025 --> 00:16:56.069
I... honey, I don't
really understand this.


153
00:16:56.237 --> 00:16:58.238
You were attacked,
or you weren't?


154
00:16:58.405 --> 00:17:00.406
It happened.

155
00:17:00.574 --> 00:17:02.700
And when he...

156
00:17:02.868 --> 00:17:05.036
when it was over,

157
00:17:05.204 --> 00:17:09.124
he vanished
like he'd never been there.


158
00:17:12.753 --> 00:17:14.879
You see?

159
00:17:15.047 --> 00:17:18.258
There's no answer, is there?
I mean, I have flipped out.


160
00:17:18.425 --> 00:17:20.385
I've flipped out twice, Cindy.

161
00:17:20.553 --> 00:17:22.053
Carla, are you taking drugs?

162
00:17:25.057 --> 00:17:27.892
No. I'm not on drugs.

163
00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.311
Well, then I think
you need to see a doctor.


164
00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.775
Carla, you're one of
the most stable people I know,


165
00:17:35.943 --> 00:17:38.778
and you are
definitely not insane,


166
00:17:38.946 --> 00:17:40.822
but when men
who aren't actually there


167
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:42.740
come into your room
and have intercourse with you,


168
00:17:42.908 --> 00:17:44.951
then it is time for you to see
a good psychiatrist.


169
00:17:45.119 --> 00:17:46.953
- I can't afford it.
- Oh, yes, you can.


170
00:17:47.121 --> 00:17:48.788
Betty Rivers, I happen
to know she goes over


171
00:17:48.956 --> 00:17:50.290
to the walk-in clinic
at the university,


172
00:17:50.457 --> 00:17:52.292
and payment is
whatever you can afford.


173
00:17:52.459 --> 00:17:54.002
- I hate the thought of it.
- Oh, I know you do.


174
00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.670
- I'm not crazy.
- Of course you're not crazy.


175
00:17:55.838 --> 00:17:58.173
I'm not crazy.
You're not crazy.


176
00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.049
You may be crazy.

177
00:18:00.217 --> 00:18:01.551
Cindy, where's that coffee?

178
00:18:01.719 --> 00:18:03.052
He's crazy.

179
00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:05.638
Sure.

180
00:18:05.806 --> 00:18:08.641
Listen,
just think about it, huh?


181
00:18:08.809 --> 00:18:11.311
You be honest with yourself,
and everything'll be okay.


182
00:18:11.478 --> 00:18:13.354
- I'll think about it.
- Good girl.


183
00:18:13.522 --> 00:18:14.814
I'd like a cup of coffee, honey.

184
00:18:14.982 --> 00:18:17.066
Coming, George.

185
00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:22.322
Looky here. Nice and hot,
just like you love it.


186
00:18:22.489 --> 00:18:24.032
Is she going to leave today?

187
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.202
Well, honey, I haven't had a chance
to talk to her about that yet.


188
00:18:27.369 --> 00:18:28.578
God damn it, Cindy.

189
00:18:28.746 --> 00:18:30.121
You told me you were going
to tell her this morning.


190
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:33.583
I am going to tell her, you see,
but first of all, I have to tell you.


191
00:18:33.751 --> 00:18:35.501
What's happened to her
is just a terrible thing.


192
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:37.337
What happened?
She probably got her butt evicted


193
00:18:37.504 --> 00:18:38.838
'cause she didn't pay
the damn rent.


194
00:18:39.006 --> 00:18:40.465
We're not going
to lend her any money.


195
00:18:40.633 --> 00:18:42.300
George, don't raise your
voice to me like that.


196
00:18:42.468 --> 00:18:44.928
I can raise my voice in my
own home if I want to.


197
00:18:45.095 --> 00:18:46.304
I just don't want to
hurt her feelings.


198
00:18:46.472 --> 00:18:47.931
She's been through
enough already as it is,


199
00:18:48.098 --> 00:18:50.433
and she is my best friend.
I've known her all my life.


200
00:18:50.601 --> 00:18:52.477
Don't you cry on me.
Don't you cry on me.


201
00:18:52.645 --> 00:18:54.896
- If you'd stop yelling at me...
- I'm going to set her straight.


202
00:19:45.739 --> 00:19:47.907
Are we going to stay here
all night, Mom?


203
00:20:50.804 --> 00:20:52.764
You guys stay here.

204
00:22:40.873 --> 00:22:42.498
Wow.

205
00:22:46.545 --> 00:22:48.463
Do you hear that?

206
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:52.717
You did hear that, didn't you?

207
00:22:52.885 --> 00:22:55.761
- I heard it, Mommy.
- What was it?


208
00:23:01.351 --> 00:23:03.144
- The keys!
- It came from under the house!


209
00:23:03.312 --> 00:23:04.979
- Don't go!
- Mommy, what's happening?


210
00:23:05.147 --> 00:23:06.606
Bill, we've got
to get out of here!


211
00:23:06.773 --> 00:23:08.399
- Mommy!
- Where are you going?


212
00:23:08.567 --> 00:23:10.443
No, don't do it!
Don't go under the house!


213
00:23:10.611 --> 00:23:11.736
There's something there!

214
00:23:11.904 --> 00:23:13.237
- Billy!
- Don't!


215
00:23:13.405 --> 00:23:15.364
- Mom, leave me alone.
- No!


216
00:23:15.532 --> 00:23:18.117
Come back!

217
00:23:18.285 --> 00:23:20.077
Bill, come back!

218
00:23:20.245 --> 00:23:22.622
Here, here.
Calm down. Calm down.


219
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:24.916
Bill, we've got
to get out of here!


220
00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:26.542
Shh.

221
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.712
Will you answer me? Bill!

222
00:23:36.553 --> 00:23:38.971
I've found it.
This is it. Look.


223
00:23:39.139 --> 00:23:41.682
When I touch this pipe,
it makes a noise.


224
00:23:43.477 --> 00:23:45.478
See?

225
00:23:46.605 --> 00:23:48.523
Then who touched it before?

226
00:24:00.869 --> 00:24:03.371
Mom. I'll leave
the door open, okay?


227
00:24:03.539 --> 00:24:04.789
Great.

228
00:24:41.368 --> 00:24:43.828
Girl, didn't your mama
teach you any better manners


229
00:24:43.996 --> 00:24:47.915
than to leave somebody's house
without even telling 'em goodbye?


230
00:24:48.083 --> 00:24:51.210
Oh, I see the couch
is already taken.


231
00:24:51.378 --> 00:24:53.546
Well, good.
I'll take the bed, then.


232
00:24:53.714 --> 00:24:56.173
- What story did you tell George?
- Oh, that old sourpuss?


233
00:24:56.341 --> 00:24:58.759
He thinks I'm with
my sister in Reseda.


234
00:24:58.927 --> 00:25:01.304
Not that I give a particular
damn what he thinks


235
00:25:01.471 --> 00:25:03.347
after the way
he behaved this morning.


236
00:25:03.515 --> 00:25:05.057
Oh, that's all right.

237
00:25:05.225 --> 00:25:07.351
Shoot. I ought to leave him,
you know.


238
00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:09.770
If I had the courage, I would.

239
00:25:09.938 --> 00:25:12.773
He's gotten to be
like a bad habit.


240
00:25:12.941 --> 00:25:15.234
You know something, Carla.
I've been thinking.


241
00:25:15.402 --> 00:25:17.987
Maybe you ought to just
move out of this old house.


242
00:25:18.155 --> 00:25:20.114
How can I?
I can't afford it.


243
00:25:20.282 --> 00:25:21.949
I haven't even paid
this month's rent.


244
00:25:22.117 --> 00:25:23.784
I have a lease.
How can I?


245
00:25:23.952 --> 00:25:25.870
When you've finished
that typing school thing,


246
00:25:26.038 --> 00:25:29.582
you ought to be able to get
a real good-paying job then, huh?


247
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:31.334
I hope so.
I'm counting on it.


248
00:25:34.254 --> 00:25:35.755
You know, Carly,

249
00:25:35.922 --> 00:25:38.674
when he gets back into town,

250
00:25:38.842 --> 00:25:41.677
you and Jerry really
ought to get married.


251
00:25:41.845 --> 00:25:44.680
George says
he's making a bundle now.


252
00:25:44.848 --> 00:25:48.434
He loves you so much, and he
absolutely dotes on the kids.


253
00:25:48.602 --> 00:25:49.977
Hell's bells, girl.

254
00:25:50.145 --> 00:25:52.980
Marry him, and you'll
be living on easy street.


255
00:25:53.148 --> 00:25:54.774
Now, what's all this baloney

256
00:25:54.941 --> 00:25:57.568
about you sleeping
on the couch?


257
00:25:57.736 --> 00:25:59.362
Which side of the bed
do you want?


258
00:26:01.031 --> 00:26:03.157
What side do you think?

259
00:26:03.325 --> 00:26:05.201
The good side.

260
00:26:05.369 --> 00:26:07.411
Well, doesn't make
any difference to me.


261
00:26:07.579 --> 00:26:09.330
I am so tired tonight,

262
00:26:09.498 --> 00:26:12.041
I could sleep on a rock.

263
00:26:12.209 --> 00:26:15.044
- Good night, sugar.
- Good night.


264
00:27:42.174 --> 00:27:45.968
Julie likes the chips,
and Kim likes the Fritos, okay?


265
00:27:46.136 --> 00:27:47.762
Mm-hmm.
Don't you worry about a thing.


266
00:27:47.929 --> 00:27:50.890
I'm going to get them dressed
and fed and off to school on time.


267
00:27:51.057 --> 00:27:52.391
You're great.
Here. I'll trade you.


268
00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:53.893
- Okay.
- Okay. Thanks.


269
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.686
You're welcome.

270
00:27:55.854 --> 00:27:57.813
You look so pretty.

271
00:27:57.981 --> 00:28:00.816
- I'll call you later.
- All right.


272
00:28:00.984 --> 00:28:02.610
Don't let Bill be late
for school, okay?


273
00:28:02.778 --> 00:28:04.111
Won't do it.

274
00:28:04.279 --> 00:28:05.863
- Bye.
- Bye.


275
00:28:08.241 --> 00:28:09.784
That's right.
At Mr. Tibby's Car Radio/Stereo,


276
00:28:09.951 --> 00:28:11.577
do we have boosters?
Do we have limiters?


277
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:15.831
Ask yourself, "How much
should I give to the Lord?"


278
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.423
What's going on? Stop!

279
00:28:24.591 --> 00:28:25.674
No!

280
00:28:27.719 --> 00:28:29.428
Stop!

281
00:28:29.596 --> 00:28:31.013
Stop! No!

282
00:28:32.182 --> 00:28:36.852
Stop!

283
00:28:39.648 --> 00:28:42.066
No!

284
00:28:43.902 --> 00:28:45.778
Stop!

285
00:28:47.948 --> 00:28:50.115
Stop! Stop!

286
00:28:51.451 --> 00:28:53.202
Stop!

287
00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:56.163
Stop it!
Stop!


288
00:29:14.724 --> 00:29:16.600
Hi.

289
00:29:18.186 --> 00:29:20.104
I'm Dr. Sneiderman.

290
00:29:20.272 --> 00:29:23.607
I'm one of the staff psychiatrists
here at the clinic.


291
00:29:26.653 --> 00:29:28.112
Are you cold?

292
00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.489
Sometimes there's a draft,
comes from the outer lobby.


293
00:29:33.702 --> 00:29:36.245
Tell me, is this the first time

294
00:29:36.413 --> 00:29:38.163
something like this
has ever happened?


295
00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.751
No.

296
00:29:42.919 --> 00:29:45.921
No, the first time was different.
I was raped.


297
00:29:49.759 --> 00:29:51.385
Where? In your home?

298
00:29:54.806 --> 00:29:57.224
You were raped by whom?

299
00:29:57.392 --> 00:29:59.935
I don't know.
There was no one there.


300
00:30:02.564 --> 00:30:04.064
Okay. So in other words,

301
00:30:04.232 --> 00:30:06.400
it wasn't a real man
that raped you?


302
00:30:08.194 --> 00:30:10.237
He evaporated.

303
00:30:10.405 --> 00:30:13.032
I see. But you felt him
in you, though?


304
00:30:13.199 --> 00:30:14.450
Definitely.

305
00:30:16.036 --> 00:30:17.620
And he felt like a man?

306
00:30:17.787 --> 00:30:20.080
A big man.

307
00:30:20.248 --> 00:30:24.293
- Were you in pain?
- Yes, of course I was in pain.


308
00:30:26.171 --> 00:30:27.838
He was foul.

309
00:30:28.006 --> 00:30:30.132
You mean you smelled him?

310
00:30:34.179 --> 00:30:36.221
I see. Did he ejaculate?

311
00:30:39.392 --> 00:30:41.310
I...

312
00:30:41.478 --> 00:30:42.978
I think so.

313
00:30:45.273 --> 00:30:47.858
But when my son came in,
there was nobody there.


314
00:30:48.026 --> 00:30:50.861
Right. And what did he think?

315
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:53.280
Your son.

316
00:30:53.448 --> 00:30:55.324
He thought I was dreaming.

317
00:30:55.492 --> 00:30:58.994
Mm-hmm.
And what do you think happened?


318
00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:09.171
Okay. That's okay, Carla.

319
00:31:11.049 --> 00:31:13.801
Is this the only other time
something like that happened?


320
00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:16.512
No.

321
00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:20.057
It started to
a second time, and...


322
00:31:20.225 --> 00:31:23.644
he didn't get me.
We went to my friend's apartment.


323
00:31:23.812 --> 00:31:26.480
And then this morning,

324
00:31:26.648 --> 00:31:28.691
I was driving to work...

325
00:31:28.858 --> 00:31:30.359
And he tried to kill you?

326
00:31:34.114 --> 00:31:35.656
What do you think?

327
00:31:37.993 --> 00:31:41.286
Go ahead, and be honest.
Just tell me.


328
00:31:41.454 --> 00:31:43.247
You think I'm insane?

329
00:31:43.415 --> 00:31:46.000
Insane?

330
00:31:46.167 --> 00:31:48.419
That means different things
to different people, Carla.


331
00:31:48.586 --> 00:31:52.047
- So there's nothing you can do?
- Well, not at the moment, Carla.


332
00:31:52.215 --> 00:31:54.091
First, we have to find out
what the problem is.


333
00:31:54.259 --> 00:31:55.342
In the meantime, I'll be dead.

334
00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.970
No, I don't think so.

335
00:31:58.138 --> 00:32:01.724
Look, Carla, you've done a very good
thing by coming here.


336
00:32:01.891 --> 00:32:04.143
You've already made
a commitment to get better.


337
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:07.146
Really, that's the first step,
and it's the hardest one.


338
00:32:07.313 --> 00:32:08.814
Huh?

339
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:12.401
Look, I'd like you to take

340
00:32:12.569 --> 00:32:14.862
a few medical
and psychological tests now.


341
00:32:15.030 --> 00:32:18.657
They're very routine. Nothing hurts.
There's no surprises.


342
00:32:18.825 --> 00:32:20.492
It takes about two hours.

343
00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.161
Mostly it's just boring.
I'd appreciate it


344
00:32:22.328 --> 00:32:24.371
if you did not fall asleep
while taking these tests.


345
00:32:24.539 --> 00:32:26.331
Right now?

346
00:32:26.499 --> 00:32:28.751
Yeah, I'd like to,
if you can spare the time, okay?


347
00:32:28.918 --> 00:32:32.129
Come on. I'll take you
down to the lab, okay?


348
00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.240
What are you doing up?

349
00:33:00.408 --> 00:33:02.409
I couldn't sleep.

350
00:33:02.577 --> 00:33:04.745
I was worried about you.

351
00:33:07.707 --> 00:33:09.583
Where is everybody?

352
00:33:09.751 --> 00:33:12.586
Billy's out working
in the garage,


353
00:33:12.754 --> 00:33:15.172
and Kim's already asleep.

354
00:33:18.802 --> 00:33:20.719
Did the doctor hurt you?

355
00:33:20.887 --> 00:33:23.430
No, baby. We just talked.

356
00:33:23.598 --> 00:33:25.265
Mommy, what happened
to your hand?


357
00:33:25.433 --> 00:33:27.768
No, don't worry about it.
You just get to sleep.


358
00:33:35.985 --> 00:33:38.821
- Mommy?
- What?


359
00:33:38.988 --> 00:33:41.073
Is everything going
to be all right?


360
00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:47.204
Of course it is.
I love you so much.


361
00:33:47.372 --> 00:33:49.581
I love you too.

362
00:33:49.749 --> 00:33:51.750
You go to sleep now.

363
00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:09.935
- Hi.
- How do you feel?


364
00:34:10.103 --> 00:34:12.062
Oh, I'm all right.
I'm just stiff.


365
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.398
What about the car?
Can you fix it?


366
00:34:14.566 --> 00:34:17.067
Yeah, I can fix it,
but it won't be cheap.


367
00:34:17.235 --> 00:34:21.530
Listen. If Jerry calls,
don't tell him anything, okay?


368
00:34:21.698 --> 00:34:26.201
Good night.

369
00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.405
Oh, my God.

370
00:37:49.197 --> 00:37:51.198
Please, God.

371
00:38:28.486 --> 00:38:31.238
Carla, this is Mrs. Hilliard.

372
00:38:31.406 --> 00:38:34.408
You want to hop up there now,
show us what you're talking about?


373
00:38:44.669 --> 00:38:47.504
Right here.
There's one.


374
00:38:47.672 --> 00:38:50.507
And right there.

375
00:38:50.675 --> 00:38:52.843
And in back.
Do you see that?


376
00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:54.511
Mm-hmm.

377
00:38:56.681 --> 00:38:58.181
And right here.

378
00:39:00.935 --> 00:39:02.936
You said something
about your thighs?


379
00:39:04.439 --> 00:39:05.814
Yeah.

380
00:39:07.608 --> 00:39:09.109
There...

381
00:39:10.403 --> 00:39:12.529
and there.

382
00:39:12.697 --> 00:39:15.699
How about those bruises on
your ankles? How did they happen?


383
00:39:19.954 --> 00:39:22.956
Oh, thank you very much,
Mrs. Hilliard. That will be all.


384
00:39:27.086 --> 00:39:28.545
Okay, look, Carla,
why don't you come down,


385
00:39:28.713 --> 00:39:30.881
make yourself
comfortable, okay?


386
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:35.427
Okay.
Can you tell me about


387
00:39:35.595 --> 00:39:38.430
those bruises
on your ankles now?


388
00:39:38.598 --> 00:39:40.515
I'm not sure.

389
00:39:40.683 --> 00:39:43.643
It felt like my legs
were being held,


390
00:39:43.811 --> 00:39:46.646
almost as if he had help.

391
00:39:46.814 --> 00:39:49.649
Uh-huh. Are you saying
that he wasn't alone?


392
00:39:49.817 --> 00:39:52.110
It felt like there was
someone on each leg.


393
00:39:53.196 --> 00:39:54.488
I see.
So what are you saying?


394
00:39:54.655 --> 00:39:56.072
That there were
two more like him?


395
00:39:58.493 --> 00:40:01.286
I guess so,
but they seemed smaller.


396
00:40:01.454 --> 00:40:03.455
Mm-hmm.
You mean like children?


397
00:40:03.623 --> 00:40:06.249
Oh, no, no, no. These aren't children.
They're strong.


398
00:40:06.417 --> 00:40:07.959
Dwarfs?

399
00:40:08.127 --> 00:40:11.129
I don't know what they were.
I couldn't see them. I felt them.


400
00:40:13.257 --> 00:40:14.466
They're real, aren't they?

401
00:40:14.634 --> 00:40:15.717
- I mean, these...
- Mm-hmm.


402
00:40:15.885 --> 00:40:17.219
- Bites and bruises are real.
- Mm-hmm.


403
00:40:17.386 --> 00:40:18.720
- They're real.
- Yes, yes.


404
00:40:18.888 --> 00:40:20.889
The bites are real.
The bruises are real.


405
00:40:21.057 --> 00:40:23.725
All pain is real.
Your feelings? They're real.


406
00:40:25.228 --> 00:40:29.064
Oh, no, no. These are in places
I couldn't have bitten myself.


407
00:40:29.232 --> 00:40:31.650
Carla, I've seen
cases of hysteria


408
00:40:31.817 --> 00:40:33.485
that have raised welts,

409
00:40:33.653 --> 00:40:36.029
caused blindness,
loss of hearing.


410
00:40:39.033 --> 00:40:40.951
Well, haven't your tests
told you anything?


411
00:40:41.118 --> 00:40:43.078
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

412
00:40:43.246 --> 00:40:47.082
We know that there is nothing
wrong with you medically,


413
00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:49.334
physiologically, that is.

414
00:40:49.502 --> 00:40:51.711
And as far as we can tell,
your intellect


415
00:40:51.879 --> 00:40:53.922
seems to function as well,
if not better than normal.


416
00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.925
So that leaves only one area
for us to explore...


417
00:40:57.093 --> 00:40:59.135
early psychological
development,


418
00:40:59.303 --> 00:41:01.388
emotional development.

419
00:41:01.556 --> 00:41:02.973
What does that mean?

420
00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:05.392
Well, the general idea

421
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:08.395
is that certain phases
of our life never really die.


422
00:41:08.563 --> 00:41:11.064
They continue to exist
within us, all of us.


423
00:41:11.232 --> 00:41:12.732
Now I'm talking
about you, me, everybody,


424
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.360
and they affect us
the rest of our lives.


425
00:41:15.528 --> 00:41:17.362
For certain reasons,
they come back.


426
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:18.863
By coming back...

427
00:41:19.031 --> 00:41:20.574
and sometimes they come back
with a vengeance...


428
00:41:20.741 --> 00:41:22.659
they can cause delusions,

429
00:41:22.827 --> 00:41:24.578
anxieties,

430
00:41:24.745 --> 00:41:26.871
hallucinations.

431
00:41:27.039 --> 00:41:28.373
So simple.

432
00:41:28.541 --> 00:41:32.210
Look, Carla,
what I'm going to do


433
00:41:32.378 --> 00:41:34.921
is I'm going to give you
some tranquilizers, okay?


434
00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:37.924
They won't knock you out,
but they will reduce your anxiety,


435
00:41:38.092 --> 00:41:39.759
which can be as bad
as the delusion itself.


436
00:41:39.927 --> 00:41:41.970
I want you to take two
before you go to sleep.


437
00:41:42.138 --> 00:41:43.722
Now, when you go home tonight,

438
00:41:43.889 --> 00:41:46.725
I want you to take
a long, hot bath, relax,


439
00:41:46.892 --> 00:41:48.602
get your kids in bed early,

440
00:41:48.769 --> 00:41:51.521
and I want somebody to be
with you at all times, okay?


441
00:41:51.689 --> 00:41:54.065
I don't want you to be alone.
I want you to get some sleep tonight.


442
00:41:54.233 --> 00:41:56.484
That clear?

443
00:41:56.652 --> 00:41:58.987
It's going to take a long time,
isn't it?


444
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.574
It could.

445
00:42:02.742 --> 00:42:05.368
Why don't we just take it one
step at a time, though, okay?


446
00:42:06.495 --> 00:42:09.247
Paging Mrs. Newman.

447
00:42:09.415 --> 00:42:11.625
Call extension 376.

448
00:42:15.129 --> 00:42:17.088
Carla?
What are you still...


449
00:42:17.256 --> 00:42:19.215
wait a second.
I'll be right there. Wait. Wait.


450
00:42:19.383 --> 00:42:21.009
- Gonna go late?
- Yeah.


451
00:42:21.177 --> 00:42:22.636
- You gonna be on tomorrow?
- Yeah.


452
00:42:22.803 --> 00:42:24.512
Okay. Then I'll see you in P.M.

453
00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:27.182
- Good.
- Carla, what's wrong?


454
00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.476
- No.
- What are you still doing here?


455
00:42:29.644 --> 00:42:31.394
Oh, I called a cab twice.
It never came.


456
00:42:31.562 --> 00:42:34.689
- Yeah? What else is new?
- I'd better call again.


457
00:42:34.857 --> 00:42:37.817
Look, why don't I give you a ride?
I'm parked right down here.


458
00:42:37.985 --> 00:42:40.654
- No, really. It's all right.
- No, come on. Don't be ridiculous.


459
00:42:40.821 --> 00:42:43.156
I'm right here.
It's no problem.


460
00:42:43.324 --> 00:42:44.824
Come on.

461
00:42:55.878 --> 00:42:57.212
Thanks for the ride.

462
00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.464
Sure. Hope my driving
didn't frighten you.


463
00:42:59.632 --> 00:43:01.925
That's how I find out
if my patients trust me.


464
00:43:07.223 --> 00:43:08.932
There's something there.

465
00:43:10.518 --> 00:43:13.353
There's really something there.

466
00:43:13.521 --> 00:43:16.773
Carla, I'd be interested in taking
a look inside. Would you mind?


467
00:43:18.442 --> 00:43:21.444
- All right.
- You sure it's okay?


468
00:43:28.202 --> 00:43:30.453
- Hi, Bill.
- Hi.


469
00:43:30.621 --> 00:43:32.080
The kids get
to the Greenspans' all right?


470
00:43:32.248 --> 00:43:33.915
Yeah, yeah. They all
went to get some pizza.


471
00:43:34.083 --> 00:43:36.918
- They should be back soon.
- Good. This is Dr. Sneiderman.


472
00:43:37.086 --> 00:43:38.420
- This is Bill.
- How do you do?


473
00:43:38.587 --> 00:43:40.839
- How do you do? '64?
- Yeah.


474
00:43:41.006 --> 00:43:42.674
What do you have in there?

475
00:43:42.842 --> 00:43:44.467
- A 235.
- All right.


476
00:43:57.606 --> 00:43:59.107
This the girls' room?

477
00:44:01.068 --> 00:44:02.569
Cute.

478
00:44:05.156 --> 00:44:07.699
Would you like to show me
where those attacks took place?


479
00:44:07.867 --> 00:44:09.367
All right.

480
00:44:17.918 --> 00:44:19.836
- May I?
- Yeah.


481
00:44:26.594 --> 00:44:29.429
Okay. You said something
about the bedroom, didn't you?


482
00:44:29.597 --> 00:44:32.015
- Through there.
- That way?


483
00:44:46.322 --> 00:44:50.283
Carla, your house isn't haunted,
no more than your car is.


484
00:44:50.451 --> 00:44:53.787
Why do I see
and feel these things?


485
00:44:55.915 --> 00:44:59.042
- I started to explain to you why...
- Yeah, I know what you told me,


486
00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:02.045
that terrible things happened to me in
my youth might come back to haunt me.


487
00:45:02.213 --> 00:45:03.713
Yeah, essentially.

488
00:45:05.758 --> 00:45:07.425
Well, terrible things
did happen to me,


489
00:45:07.593 --> 00:45:10.512
and I didn't have
a normal childhood, but...


490
00:45:10.679 --> 00:45:12.931
- Mm-hmm.
- How many people do?


491
00:45:13.098 --> 00:45:14.349
- Carla. Carla.
- I mean, did you?


492
00:45:14.517 --> 00:45:15.600
- How many people have normal...
- Carla.


493
00:45:15.768 --> 00:45:18.394
Some things are more terrible
than other things.


494
00:45:18.562 --> 00:45:21.731
Some children are more
sensitive than other children.


495
00:45:32.243 --> 00:45:35.078
Make yourself comfortable.

496
00:45:35.246 --> 00:45:39.082
So, you really think talk
could fix all this, huh?


497
00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:41.876
I don't know,
but it's a good start.


498
00:45:42.044 --> 00:45:44.587
All right.
I'll talk a blue streak


499
00:45:44.755 --> 00:45:46.714
if it'll stop all this
from happening.


500
00:45:48.217 --> 00:45:51.052
As a kid, I experienced
every clich√© in the book.


501
00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.055
I was afraid of the dark.

502
00:45:54.223 --> 00:45:56.224
I was scared of my father.

503
00:45:56.392 --> 00:45:58.268
He was a minister,
if you can believe it.


504
00:45:58.435 --> 00:46:01.104
He actually spoke
with "thee" and "thou."


505
00:46:01.272 --> 00:46:03.314
I was six before I realized
not everyone talked that way.


506
00:46:03.482 --> 00:46:04.816
It was quite a shock.

507
00:46:04.984 --> 00:46:06.484
Why were you afraid of him?

508
00:46:07.987 --> 00:46:09.362
Because when he held me,

509
00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:11.406
it wasn't the way a father
should hold a daughter.


510
00:46:11.574 --> 00:46:13.533
How did he hold you?

511
00:46:13.701 --> 00:46:15.577
You know what I mean.

512
00:46:15.744 --> 00:46:18.371
Mm-hmm.
Did your mother know?


513
00:46:18.539 --> 00:46:20.373
I think so.

514
00:46:22.626 --> 00:46:24.836
So I ran away, and...

515
00:46:25.004 --> 00:46:27.463
I got as far as New York,
and that's where I met Mario.


516
00:46:27.631 --> 00:46:31.092
Billy's the spitting image of him.
It's very strange.


517
00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:33.803
Really?
Must have been quite handsome.


518
00:46:33.971 --> 00:46:36.806
- Billy's a good-looking kid.
- He was.


519
00:46:38.517 --> 00:46:40.768
Can you tell me about him?

520
00:46:40.936 --> 00:46:43.396
I was 16.
That says an awful lot right there.


521
00:46:43.564 --> 00:46:45.607
I was...
I'd never met anyone like him.


522
00:46:45.774 --> 00:46:47.942
He was exciting.

523
00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:50.695
What do you mean, "exciting"?
Exciting in bed?


524
00:46:50.863 --> 00:46:53.615
Yeah. He was exciting in bed.
He was exciting in many ways.


525
00:46:53.782 --> 00:46:55.450
But you did like
making love with him?


526
00:46:55.618 --> 00:46:56.826
Mm-hmm.

527
00:46:56.994 --> 00:46:59.203
At first,
and then it turned bad.


528
00:46:59.371 --> 00:47:00.914
The sex?

529
00:47:01.081 --> 00:47:02.415
- Everything turned bad.
- I see.


530
00:47:02.583 --> 00:47:04.626
I mean, I got pregnant.
Before I knew it,


531
00:47:04.793 --> 00:47:07.003
he started drinking,
taking pills.


532
00:47:07.171 --> 00:47:08.796
It was a mess.
Everything was a mess.


533
00:47:10.299 --> 00:47:13.092
What happened to him?

534
00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.511
He got himself killed
on his motorcycle.


535
00:47:15.679 --> 00:47:18.264
- I see. How old were you?
- 16.


536
00:47:18.432 --> 00:47:20.725
Gee.
So Billy wasn't born yet?


537
00:47:20.893 --> 00:47:23.728
No. I mean, I was pregnant.

538
00:47:25.314 --> 00:47:26.898
How did you feel when he died?

539
00:47:28.275 --> 00:47:29.943
How do you think I felt?

540
00:47:30.110 --> 00:47:32.028
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?


541
00:47:32.196 --> 00:47:33.821
- He was my husband.
- Yeah, I know that,


542
00:47:33.989 --> 00:47:35.615
but I still don't know
how you felt.


543
00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:41.245
I thanked God. I did.

544
00:47:41.413 --> 00:47:43.790
I thanked God when he died.

545
00:47:49.129 --> 00:47:50.838
I also thanked God
for Bob Garrett.


546
00:47:52.967 --> 00:47:54.676
- Bob Garrett?
- Julie and Kim's father.


547
00:47:54.843 --> 00:47:56.302
Ah, right, right, right.

548
00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:58.638
He was older.
He knew a lot.


549
00:47:58.806 --> 00:48:02.058
He made me see
that life was good,


550
00:48:02.226 --> 00:48:05.436
that men and women loving each other
was good, healthy,


551
00:48:05.604 --> 00:48:08.439
having children
was good, simple.


552
00:48:08.607 --> 00:48:10.900
So Bob was your second husband?

553
00:48:11.068 --> 00:48:13.361
Well, no.
We were never legally married.


554
00:48:13.529 --> 00:48:15.571
Uh-huh. Where is he now?

555
00:48:15.739 --> 00:48:17.740
I don't know.

556
00:48:17.908 --> 00:48:20.910
He was never the kind
to stay in one place very long.


557
00:48:24.248 --> 00:48:25.915
I'm impressed.

558
00:48:26.083 --> 00:48:29.419
By what?
By what? Your independence,


559
00:48:29.586 --> 00:48:31.004
knowing who you are,
what you want,


560
00:48:31.171 --> 00:48:33.089
keeping your family together,
doing it the hard way.


561
00:48:37.886 --> 00:48:40.388
I do need your help.

562
00:48:40.556 --> 00:48:43.141
I really do.

563
00:48:43.308 --> 00:48:45.351
And I won't fight you.

564
00:48:46.937 --> 00:48:49.772
Because if it is me,
if it's really me creating all this,


565
00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.441
if I'm that sick...

566
00:48:53.235 --> 00:48:54.902
then I have to be stopped.

567
00:48:57.614 --> 00:48:59.157
But if it isn't me...

568
00:49:00.659 --> 00:49:02.535
then we have to make a deal,
you and I,


569
00:49:02.703 --> 00:49:05.705
to accept that fact and find
about a way to stop it, okay?


570
00:49:06.999 --> 00:49:08.875
Okay.

571
00:49:10.627 --> 00:49:11.961
- Mommy!
- Mommy!


572
00:49:12.129 --> 00:49:13.588
- In here!
- Mommy!


573
00:49:13.756 --> 00:49:16.132
Hi. Hi, you guys.
How you doing?


574
00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.426
- Fine.
- This is Dr. Sneiderman.


575
00:49:18.594 --> 00:49:20.428
- This is Kim. This is Julie.
- Hi, Kim. Hi, Julie.


576
00:49:20.596 --> 00:49:21.846
- You guys full?
- Yeah.


577
00:49:22.014 --> 00:49:23.473
Aw, you don't have
any room for dessert.


578
00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.516
- Yeah, I do.
- I'm hungry for dessert.


579
00:49:25.684 --> 00:49:27.685
Okay, okay.
I think it's time for me to go.


580
00:49:27.853 --> 00:49:29.896
- Okay. I'll walk you out.
- Bye-bye, girls. Nice meeting you.


581
00:49:30.064 --> 00:49:32.356
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.


582
00:49:32.524 --> 00:49:34.025
I'm nervous about tomorrow.

583
00:49:34.193 --> 00:49:35.651
- What, about the staff meeting?
- Yeah.


584
00:49:35.819 --> 00:49:37.987
Oh, don't be silly.
They're perfectly routine.


585
00:49:38.155 --> 00:49:40.531
- Good night.
- Bye-bye.


586
00:49:47.831 --> 00:49:50.374
But there's still
something here.


587
00:50:06.183 --> 00:50:08.017
Mommy, I can't wait.

588
00:50:08.185 --> 00:50:11.020
- Okay. Don't cheat.
- This is almost perfect.


589
00:50:11.188 --> 00:50:13.272
- We're so hungry.
- This is the best part.


590
00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:14.816
- Right, Mom?
- Okay, okay.


591
00:50:14.983 --> 00:50:16.567
- Mommy!
- We got it. Okay.


592
00:50:16.735 --> 00:50:19.028
Now hold on. Don't look yet.
Okay. Now look.


593
00:50:19.196 --> 00:50:21.155
Mommy!

594
00:50:21.323 --> 00:50:22.615
Okay, I'm going to go
get a chair.


595
00:50:22.783 --> 00:50:24.283
Hey. You can't use your hands.
Come on. Come on.


596
00:50:24.451 --> 00:50:26.452
- Come on.
- Don't start without me.


597
00:50:30.249 --> 00:50:31.624
Bill.

598
00:50:31.792 --> 00:50:33.167
- Bill.
- Mom!


599
00:50:33.335 --> 00:50:34.836
Help!

600
00:50:44.596 --> 00:50:47.098
- Mom.
- No!


601
00:50:47.266 --> 00:50:48.599
Help me! Help!

602
00:50:48.767 --> 00:50:50.685
Get off her!
Get off her!


603
00:50:50.853 --> 00:50:52.478
Get off her!

604
00:51:07.995 --> 00:51:09.871
Stop!

605
00:51:15.711 --> 00:51:20.298
Help me.

606
00:51:26.138 --> 00:51:29.223
Mom! Mom!

607
00:51:29.391 --> 00:51:31.392
Mom!

608
00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:33.686
Aah!

609
00:51:45.616 --> 00:51:47.700
Mom!

610
00:51:56.585 --> 00:52:01.088
Well, Dr. Sneiderman explained
it was like a very powerful dream.


611
00:52:01.256 --> 00:52:03.216
Mrs. Moran...

612
00:52:05.928 --> 00:52:07.470
did you believe him?

613
00:52:09.056 --> 00:52:11.057
I tried to.

614
00:52:11.225 --> 00:52:12.975
But you...

615
00:52:13.143 --> 00:52:15.811
cannot. Hmm?

616
00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:21.025
Why?

617
00:52:21.193 --> 00:52:25.446
Because he hurt my son.
He broke his wrist.


618
00:52:25.614 --> 00:52:29.075
Because my children feel it.

619
00:52:29.243 --> 00:52:32.203
Because of the marks on my body.
They're in places I...


620
00:52:32.371 --> 00:52:34.997
I can't do it to myself.
Even in a dream.


621
00:52:35.165 --> 00:52:37.959
Why does he attack you, Carla,

622
00:52:38.126 --> 00:52:40.211
not anyone else?

623
00:52:41.713 --> 00:52:43.214
I don't know.

624
00:52:44.841 --> 00:52:46.467
I suppose he chose me.

625
00:52:46.635 --> 00:52:49.220
Chose you? Why?

626
00:52:52.599 --> 00:52:55.142
I suppose
he finds me attractive.


627
00:52:56.728 --> 00:53:00.147
Would it be a reflection
on you as a woman


628
00:53:00.315 --> 00:53:02.275
if he left you,

629
00:53:02.442 --> 00:53:04.443
or if you were cured?

630
00:53:06.405 --> 00:53:09.365
No. It would not be
a reflection on me.


631
00:53:09.533 --> 00:53:11.909
I hate this whole thing.
It's like a nightmare,


632
00:53:12.077 --> 00:53:14.287
I can't wake up.
I want to get rid of him.


633
00:53:14.454 --> 00:53:16.622
Of course you do, Carla.

634
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:18.416
And we're trying to help you.

635
00:53:18.583 --> 00:53:21.460
Well, I'm not sure how much good
all this talking's doing.


636
00:53:21.628 --> 00:53:24.714
Well, it's our way
of trying to understand.


637
00:53:24.881 --> 00:53:27.675
Well, so far, it hasn't helped.
It hasn't with Dr. Sneiderman.


638
00:53:36.226 --> 00:53:38.853
Look, you'll have to excuse me.
I have an appointment.


639
00:53:39.021 --> 00:53:40.521
I have to meet someone at
the airport. Is that all right?


640
00:53:40.689 --> 00:53:45.067
Certainly, and thank you very much,
Carla, for letting us talk to you.


641
00:53:45.235 --> 00:53:47.153
- Sure.
- All right.


642
00:53:51.867 --> 00:53:53.701
Quite a young lady.

643
00:53:53.869 --> 00:53:56.537
- Yep.
- How did you meet her?


644
00:53:56.705 --> 00:53:58.706
I was on call one night at the clinic,
she walked in.


645
00:53:58.874 --> 00:54:00.458
Just came in out of the blue?

646
00:54:00.625 --> 00:54:01.959
- Please.
- There you go.


647
00:54:02.127 --> 00:54:04.086
- Thank you.
- A walk-in.


648
00:54:04.254 --> 00:54:06.839
That's how it happens.

649
00:54:07.007 --> 00:54:09.842
- Yeah.
- She's masturbating.


650
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:11.635
This entire circus,
she has invented it


651
00:54:11.803 --> 00:54:13.471
to cover up what
every little girl does.


652
00:54:13.638 --> 00:54:16.015
Well, with all due respect, sir,

653
00:54:16.183 --> 00:54:18.142
that was my initial diagnosis,

654
00:54:18.310 --> 00:54:19.810
but I think we can all agree

655
00:54:19.978 --> 00:54:22.313
that that's not some teenager
with an identity crisis,


656
00:54:22.481 --> 00:54:24.065
and now she tells us

657
00:54:24.232 --> 00:54:26.567
that her children are feeling
this thing too, so...


658
00:54:26.735 --> 00:54:30.696
It's a mass illusion,
folie √† quatre.


659
00:54:30.864 --> 00:54:34.033
Hysteria is contagious.
Given the right circumstances,


660
00:54:34.201 --> 00:54:36.827
anyone can see and feel things
that simply aren't there.


661
00:54:36.995 --> 00:54:38.954
Her children are just
supporting Mama's delusions.


662
00:54:39.122 --> 00:54:40.956
Okay, classically correct,
sir, but her mind


663
00:54:41.124 --> 00:54:43.876
is giving her very strong
and explicit images.


664
00:54:44.044 --> 00:54:46.879
Why is she going to such lengths
to support this delusion? It...


665
00:54:47.047 --> 00:54:48.839
Phil, look at the record.

666
00:54:49.007 --> 00:54:51.842
She believes that her father
has incestuous desires.


667
00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:55.596
She falls in love with an adolescent,
a typical overgrown kid.


668
00:54:55.764 --> 00:54:57.681
He tries to prove he's
a real man, and he's not.


669
00:54:57.849 --> 00:54:59.517
After which,
she picks up with this...


670
00:54:59.684 --> 00:55:01.852
- Jerry Anderson?
- No, Garrett.


671
00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.562
- Oh, Garrett.
- Bob Garrett, right?


672
00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:05.731
A man old enough
to be her father.


673
00:55:05.899 --> 00:55:07.274
See a pattern here?

674
00:55:07.442 --> 00:55:09.318
I think I know what you're suggesting.
I don't know that I agree, though.


675
00:55:09.486 --> 00:55:11.070
- Safe sex.
- Well...


676
00:55:11.238 --> 00:55:13.072
It's the story of Carla's life.

677
00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.367
She's consistently refused to
get involved in the real thing.


678
00:55:16.535 --> 00:55:19.954
- She has three children.
- What does that prove?


679
00:55:20.122 --> 00:55:21.872
It doesn't take sex
to make babies.


680
00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.582
That is a fact
I wasn't aware of.


681
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:25.376
- Well, now you know.
- Not real sex.


682
00:55:25.544 --> 00:55:27.086
Now, for 32 years,

683
00:55:27.254 --> 00:55:29.380
Carla goes along very smoothly,

684
00:55:29.548 --> 00:55:31.757
and all of a sudden,
she meets this fellow...


685
00:55:31.925 --> 00:55:33.676
- What's his name?
- Jerry Anderson?


686
00:55:33.844 --> 00:55:34.885
- Now you have it.
- Ah, now I'm on it.


687
00:55:35.053 --> 00:55:36.595
Okay. And, pow,

688
00:55:36.763 --> 00:55:40.433
she drifts into
a Dionysian fantasy.


689
00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:43.436
Don't you see?
It's exactly the kind of situation


690
00:55:43.603 --> 00:55:44.937
that can energize
this sort of breakdown.


691
00:55:45.105 --> 00:55:46.480
What, Anderson?

692
00:55:46.648 --> 00:55:49.150
Certainly. A real man. Sure.
She wants the real thing.


693
00:55:49.317 --> 00:55:52.153
No more faking it
with kids and old men.


694
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.406
And faced with the real thing,
Carla buckles.


695
00:55:55.574 --> 00:55:57.825
She falls back
into an infantile reality.


696
00:55:57.993 --> 00:56:00.828
Now, I suggest
you dig a lot deeper.


697
00:56:00.996 --> 00:56:02.580
I think you're
going to find out more,


698
00:56:02.747 --> 00:56:04.623
and maybe you'll find out

699
00:56:04.791 --> 00:56:08.252
that Carla is
not what she seems to be.


700
00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.212
Hear, hear.

701
00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.391
You look different.

702
00:56:22.559 --> 00:56:24.894
- How?
- I don't know.


703
00:56:25.061 --> 00:56:28.397
The face,
this serious look.


704
00:56:28.565 --> 00:56:31.692
- So's yours.
- No, no.


705
00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:33.444
Your eyes have...

706
00:56:33.612 --> 00:56:36.155
changed or something.

707
00:56:36.323 --> 00:56:37.990
What is it?

708
00:56:40.076 --> 00:56:41.660
It's been a long time.

709
00:56:41.828 --> 00:56:44.455
You know, it's been too long.

710
00:56:44.623 --> 00:56:46.207
- Something's wrong?
- No.


711
00:56:46.374 --> 00:56:47.708
- Billy?
- No.


712
00:56:47.876 --> 00:56:49.418
Me, right?

713
00:56:49.586 --> 00:56:51.337
Come on.

714
00:56:51.505 --> 00:56:54.715
No. Just nothing. It's...

715
00:56:54.883 --> 00:56:57.593
I'm only afraid.

716
00:56:57.761 --> 00:57:00.429
You know, I'm just...
when you're not around,


717
00:57:00.597 --> 00:57:03.432
I'm afraid of losing you.

718
00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.059
That's all.

719
00:57:05.227 --> 00:57:06.894
You won't lose me, honey.

720
00:57:08.396 --> 00:57:10.523
I go crazy thinking about it.

721
00:57:10.690 --> 00:57:12.358
Don't go crazy either.

722
00:57:14.819 --> 00:57:16.320
What if I did?

723
00:57:18.698 --> 00:57:20.324
What if I went crazy?

724
00:57:22.577 --> 00:57:25.412
Now, you're not going to go
and do that right now.


725
00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:28.791
What would you do if I did?
Would you leave me?


726
00:57:28.959 --> 00:57:32.253
You'd still be my Carla.

727
00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:34.338
Why are you
carrying on tonight?


728
00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:38.676
Are you ready for my surprise?

729
00:57:38.843 --> 00:57:40.970
Yeah.

730
00:57:41.137 --> 00:57:42.805
I'm going
on the road again, Carly,


731
00:57:42.973 --> 00:57:45.307
but this is the last time.

732
00:57:45.475 --> 00:57:47.601
When I get back, it's for good.

733
00:57:47.769 --> 00:57:50.479
I'm taking over the LA office.

734
00:57:50.647 --> 00:57:54.400
We're going to be
a family, Carly, all of us.


735
00:57:59.489 --> 00:58:02.992
Take me with you.
Please?


736
00:58:03.159 --> 00:58:05.578
Just put me in your pocket
and take me with you.


737
00:58:05.745 --> 00:58:07.705
Honey, I can't.
You know that.


738
00:58:07.872 --> 00:58:10.374
Don't ask that.
What the hell are you asking,


739
00:58:10.542 --> 00:58:12.418
to take you with me?
Where? On the road?


740
00:58:12.586 --> 00:58:15.212
Yeah. I'll go anywhere with you.

741
00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:18.173
Okay, what about your job,
your school?


742
00:58:18.341 --> 00:58:20.384
How about the kids?
Who's going to take care of them?


743
00:58:20.552 --> 00:58:22.469
Yeah, all right. Okay.

744
00:58:22.637 --> 00:58:25.014
You're right.
It was just a pipe dream.


745
00:58:27.017 --> 00:58:30.561
You have to go on the road,
and I have to go through what...


746
00:58:30.729 --> 00:58:32.980
I'm going through.

747
00:58:33.148 --> 00:58:34.857
What you're going through?

748
00:58:35.025 --> 00:58:36.358
You know, you're not
telling me everything.


749
00:58:36.526 --> 00:58:37.860
What the hell
are you going through?


750
00:58:38.028 --> 00:58:39.361
What I'm going through's
being without you.


751
00:58:39.529 --> 00:58:41.155
That's really
what I'm going through.


752
00:58:41.323 --> 00:58:42.823
Car, it's all going to change.

753
00:58:42.991 --> 00:58:45.826
Oh, sure. When you get back.

754
00:58:45.994 --> 00:58:47.995
Just one more trip.

755
00:58:48.163 --> 00:58:51.999
Do you know it's been the way
it's been ever since we met?


756
00:58:52.167 --> 00:58:53.792
"Just one more trip."

757
00:58:58.214 --> 00:59:01.050
No, I'm sorry.
I don't feel like it.


758
00:59:01.217 --> 00:59:02.885
I'm sorry.

759
00:59:06.181 --> 00:59:08.515
Look, I have to...
I think I should go home.


760
00:59:08.683 --> 00:59:11.518
It's late, and I have
to get up early. Okay?


761
00:59:11.686 --> 00:59:13.520
I'll take you home.

762
00:59:13.688 --> 00:59:15.814
No. You call me a cab.

763
00:59:15.982 --> 00:59:17.483
You don't have to bother.

764
01:02:39.435 --> 01:02:49.435
Ohh.

765
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:29.943
Oh, God.

766
01:03:55.762 --> 01:03:58.680
Get out! Get out!

767
01:03:58.848 --> 01:04:01.600
Get out!

768
01:04:15.073 --> 01:04:17.658
Why did you tear up your room?
Why did you yell at Billy?


769
01:04:17.825 --> 01:04:19.493
- Because I had an orgasm.
- What?


770
01:04:19.661 --> 01:04:21.828
I had an orgasm.

771
01:04:21.996 --> 01:04:24.373
An orgasm?

772
01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:27.042
Yeah. But he tricked me.
I was asleep.


773
01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:29.336
I was asleep,
and I was dreaming.


774
01:04:32.298 --> 01:04:33.799
And I'm ashamed.

775
01:04:35.009 --> 01:04:36.718
I'm ashamed.

776
01:04:38.513 --> 01:04:40.222
Mm-hmm.
Carla, I want you


777
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:42.599
to sign yourself
into the hospital.


778
01:04:44.602 --> 01:04:46.144
No. I won't let myself
be committed.


779
01:04:46.312 --> 01:04:48.188
No, you're not being committed.
It's just going to be


780
01:04:48.356 --> 01:04:49.648
for a two-week observation period.
That's all.


781
01:04:49.816 --> 01:04:51.483
It amounts to the same thing.
You know it.


782
01:04:51.651 --> 01:04:53.860
Carla, do you know
that if we wanted to,


783
01:04:54.028 --> 01:04:55.362
we can insist
that you stay here.


784
01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:56.863
- No, you can't.
- Oh, yes, we can.


785
01:04:57.031 --> 01:04:59.408
Yes, we can,
for trying to commit suicide.


786
01:04:59.575 --> 01:05:01.785
- What are you talking about, suicide?
- You know what I'm talking about.


787
01:05:01.953 --> 01:05:03.662
What do you think you were doing
when you crashed your car?


788
01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:06.289
- He was trying to murder me!
- It was a suicide attempt, Carla.


789
01:05:06.457 --> 01:05:08.500
We could have you in here
before the day is out.


790
01:05:08.668 --> 01:05:11.086
No, you can't.
There were no witnesses.


791
01:05:11.254 --> 01:05:12.838
I won't say a thing.
It's my decision.


792
01:05:13.006 --> 01:05:15.424
- What, to stay sick?
- To stay alive.


793
01:05:15.591 --> 01:05:18.635
No matter what you think,
he's stronger than you are.


794
01:05:18.803 --> 01:05:20.178
He'll kill me if he has to.

795
01:05:20.346 --> 01:05:21.805
Why, to keep you
from getting better, right?


796
01:05:21.973 --> 01:05:23.098
However you want
to call it, yes.


797
01:05:23.266 --> 01:05:24.850
Yes, that's what I want
to call it. Exactly.


798
01:05:25.018 --> 01:05:26.309
How about Jerry?
What are you going to do with him?


799
01:05:26.477 --> 01:05:27.936
How are you going
to deal with him?


800
01:05:28.104 --> 01:05:30.230
How would I deal with him
from a padded cell?


801
01:05:30.398 --> 01:05:31.898
What about your kids, Carla?

802
01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.276
Carla, listen to me.

803
01:05:34.444 --> 01:05:35.902
You're running the risk
of harming your children.


804
01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:37.320
No. They won't be harmed.

805
01:05:37.488 --> 01:05:38.864
Billy has already
broken his wrist.


806
01:05:39.032 --> 01:05:40.365
Beyond that, you're harming them
psychologically.


807
01:05:40.533 --> 01:05:41.783
There's nothing wrong
with my children.


808
01:05:41.951 --> 01:05:44.369
Carla, that's not the environment
they need. You know that.


809
01:05:44.537 --> 01:05:46.997
Look, I know you think I'm crazy.
It doesn't matter about your theories.


810
01:05:47.165 --> 01:05:49.750
Whether it's me or something
else is beside the point now.


811
01:05:49.917 --> 01:05:52.169
What are you telling me? You're going to
stay home and be victimized?


812
01:05:52.336 --> 01:05:53.420
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?


813
01:05:53.588 --> 01:05:56.256
I'll stay at home. I'll see you.
I'll go to secretarial school.


814
01:05:56.424 --> 01:05:58.091
When I graduate,
I'll look for a better job.


815
01:05:58.259 --> 01:06:00.510
But the one thing I won't do
is to go into any hospital.


816
01:06:00.678 --> 01:06:02.012
Mm-hmm, and you'll
be beaten and frightened.


817
01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.306
- No. No.
- No? No? Why not?


818
01:06:04.474 --> 01:06:06.183
'Cause I'm going
to cooperate with him.


819
01:06:20.364 --> 01:06:23.909
Carla, you're
a very intelligent woman.


820
01:06:24.077 --> 01:06:25.577
I know you'll always
listen to reason,


821
01:06:25.745 --> 01:06:27.704
so now I want to talk to you
reasonably, okay?


822
01:06:27.872 --> 01:06:30.457
No more questions
and answers, hmm?


823
01:06:30.625 --> 01:06:33.960
You know, there was a time when people
believed in the supernatural.


824
01:06:34.128 --> 01:06:36.338
Here. I want you
to look at these pictures.


825
01:06:37.423 --> 01:06:39.299
Pretty frightening, huh?

826
01:06:39.467 --> 01:06:42.886
Bats, werewolves,
dragons, demons,


827
01:06:43.054 --> 01:06:45.514
all sorts of goblins, okay?

828
01:06:45.681 --> 01:06:48.517
They were supposed
to abuse people sexually.


829
01:06:48.684 --> 01:06:51.394
They were supposed
to impregnate people.


830
01:06:51.562 --> 01:06:53.647
Do you think these things
really exist in there?


831
01:06:53.815 --> 01:06:56.191
- I am not stupid.
- I didn't say you were stupid.


832
01:06:56.359 --> 01:06:58.401
But why do you think these
people saw these things, huh?


833
01:06:58.569 --> 01:07:00.946
Why do you think they saw them?

834
01:07:01.114 --> 01:07:03.532
Hmm? Can you take a guess?
Do you know why?


835
01:07:03.699 --> 01:07:06.451
Because it was a way of expressing
something that was frightening to them.


836
01:07:06.619 --> 01:07:08.662
- It has nothing to do with me.
- Wait a second. Carla...


837
01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:10.413
- it has a lot to do with you.
- It has nothing to do with me.


838
01:07:10.581 --> 01:07:12.040
Oh, no, it has a lot
to do with you.


839
01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:13.708
It has an awful lot
to do with you.


840
01:07:13.876 --> 01:07:16.711
These ghosts and demons
were only ideas,


841
01:07:16.879 --> 01:07:18.880
but people saw them.

842
01:07:20.842 --> 01:07:24.678
Look, Carla, let's say
a man who wanted to be good


843
01:07:24.846 --> 01:07:27.681
had a desire
for his neighbor's wife.


844
01:07:27.849 --> 01:07:30.517
He knows it's wrong,
he feels terrible about it,


845
01:07:30.685 --> 01:07:32.936
but the desire
is growing and growing.


846
01:07:33.104 --> 01:07:35.730
Desire can be a very frightening
and powerful sensation.


847
01:07:35.898 --> 01:07:39.025
How does he deal with it?
He invents a creature,


848
01:07:39.193 --> 01:07:41.987
an evil, ugly,
evil-tempered creature


849
01:07:42.155 --> 01:07:44.990
which is just a picture
of his own desire, Carla.


850
01:07:45.158 --> 01:07:46.867
I have no need of inventing
anything, Dr. Sneiderman.


851
01:07:47.034 --> 01:07:49.494
Come on, Carla, stop it.
You have a lot of need.


852
01:07:49.662 --> 01:07:50.912
You were scared of your daddy.

853
01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:52.247
He was a minister.
He held you in a way


854
01:07:52.415 --> 01:07:53.665
- he shouldn't have held you.
- Stop it.


855
01:07:53.833 --> 01:07:55.292
- You were pregnant at 16.
- Oh, shut up!


856
01:07:55.459 --> 01:07:56.918
A drug-crazed guy
went off and killed himself.


857
01:07:57.086 --> 01:07:58.170
- Stop it!
- Another guy left you


858
01:07:58.337 --> 01:07:59.838
with two kids.
Now, Carla, stop it!


859
01:08:00.006 --> 01:08:03.592
Come on. Do the work, Carla.
What was evil to your family?


860
01:08:03.759 --> 01:08:06.261
All sorts of things were evil
to my family. You know that.


861
01:08:06.429 --> 01:08:08.013
Carla, we know your family well enough
to know what was evil to them.


862
01:08:08.181 --> 01:08:09.598
As a child, you knew
what was evil to him. What?


863
01:08:09.765 --> 01:08:12.267
- Sex. They were afraid of sex.
- Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex.


864
01:08:12.435 --> 01:08:13.977
They were afraid of sex.
Exactly.


865
01:08:14.145 --> 01:08:16.688
So let's use our imagination
a little bit, okay?


866
01:08:16.856 --> 01:08:18.190
Let's try putting
some things together.


867
01:08:18.357 --> 01:08:19.816
Like a dream,
it's getting all mixed up.


868
01:08:19.984 --> 01:08:21.318
Your creature is
a symbol, Carla.


869
01:08:21.485 --> 01:08:22.819
A symbol of what?

870
01:08:22.987 --> 01:08:24.529
I don't know yet.
Maybe we'll find out.


871
01:08:24.697 --> 01:08:27.532
Could be a specific person,
a fear of someone, a desire...


872
01:08:27.700 --> 01:08:30.202
No, I'm not hiding
from anybody or anything!


873
01:08:30.369 --> 01:08:33.455
Carla. Carla, let's talk
about your visitor friend, okay?


874
01:08:33.623 --> 01:08:36.291
- Dr. Sneiderman, I'm so sick of this.
- Take a good look at him.


875
01:08:36.459 --> 01:08:38.001
What do we know
about him, Carla?


876
01:08:38.169 --> 01:08:39.628
Come on. Let's use your words.
What do we know about him?


877
01:08:39.795 --> 01:08:42.380
We know that he is big,
we know that he is strong.


878
01:08:42.548 --> 01:08:44.466
It's frightening how strong
this guy is, isn't it?


879
01:08:44.634 --> 01:08:46.384
You told me,
unbelievably strong.


880
01:08:46.552 --> 01:08:48.887
So why does he need help?
But he has two helpers, right?


881
01:08:49.055 --> 01:08:51.389
Two little ones? Right?
Those are your words.


882
01:08:51.557 --> 01:08:53.058
One big one
and two little ones.


883
01:08:53.226 --> 01:08:54.559
- Oh, you're obscene.
- Billy's a good-looking kid.


884
01:08:54.727 --> 01:08:55.977
What you're suggesting
is obscene.


885
01:08:56.145 --> 01:08:57.312
- He's a strong kid.
- You're obscene!


886
01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.897
You're having
trouble with Jerry, and...


887
01:08:59.065 --> 01:09:00.398
- You're obscene.
- Carla, calm... Carla!


888
01:09:00.566 --> 01:09:02.567
- I'll calm down, but not here!
- Carla!


889
01:09:02.735 --> 01:09:04.319
Shit.

890
01:09:11.327 --> 01:09:13.995
He was talking about
two little ones and a big one.


891
01:09:14.163 --> 01:09:16.998
He was implying that I wanted
to make love with Billy.


892
01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:22.379
It was just obscene, you know?

893
01:09:22.546 --> 01:09:23.880
- Really.
- It was obscene.


894
01:09:24.048 --> 01:09:25.382
There's no other word for it.

895
01:09:25.549 --> 01:09:27.759
No. I think
he just pushed too far.


896
01:09:27.927 --> 01:09:29.886
He pushed too far. It was disgusting.
It was sickening.


897
01:09:30.054 --> 01:09:32.097
I mean, I know he has to probe
into painful areas


898
01:09:32.265 --> 01:09:33.556
- and everything, but...
- That's not probing.


899
01:09:33.724 --> 01:09:35.183
I'm not going back.
I'm never going back.


900
01:09:35.351 --> 01:09:36.810
Oh, no. Wait a minute.
Maybe you're overreacting


901
01:09:36.978 --> 01:09:38.436
- a little bit, Carla.
- I'm never going back.


902
01:09:38.604 --> 01:09:39.729
- Honey?
- What?


903
01:09:39.897 --> 01:09:41.690
- You ready to go?
- Yes, I am, George.


904
01:09:41.857 --> 01:09:43.692
Just give me a minute, please.

905
01:09:43.859 --> 01:09:46.528
Well, I'm going to get the car,
'cause I don't want to be late.


906
01:09:46.696 --> 01:09:48.530
Okay, honey.
No, we're not going to be late.


907
01:09:50.992 --> 01:09:52.325
I don't want
to cause any trouble...


908
01:09:52.493 --> 01:09:53.868
- No.
- Between you and George.


909
01:09:54.036 --> 01:09:55.704
I shouldn't have barged in.
I should have called.


910
01:09:55.871 --> 01:09:57.205
No, no, no. We just have

911
01:09:57.373 --> 01:09:59.082
- to make an appearance...
- I just wanted to talk.


912
01:09:59.250 --> 01:10:01.710
At this boring wedding reception.
It's important to George, you know?


913
01:10:01.877 --> 01:10:03.753
Well, I'm going
to see you tomorrow.


914
01:10:03.921 --> 01:10:04.921
No, I want you to stay here.

915
01:10:05.089 --> 01:10:06.965
We're going to be back
in less than an hour.


916
01:10:07.133 --> 01:10:08.300
Now come on, Carla.

917
01:10:08.467 --> 01:10:10.343
I need to talk to you
some more about this.


918
01:10:10.511 --> 01:10:12.554
Carla...

919
01:10:12.722 --> 01:10:14.889
will you wait here
until I get back?


920
01:10:15.057 --> 01:10:16.808
- Yeah.
- Please. You look so tired.


921
01:10:16.976 --> 01:10:18.852
Why don't you sit down
and have something to eat?


922
01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:20.562
Have fun.

923
01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:22.814
Okay. I'll see you
in a little bit.


924
01:10:22.982 --> 01:10:24.482
Okay.

925
01:10:49.175 --> 01:10:51.593
Hi, Bill.
How are the girls?


926
01:10:51.761 --> 01:10:53.261
How's everything? Okay?

927
01:10:55.306 --> 01:10:57.349
Dr. Sneiderman?
You didn't tell him where I was?


928
01:10:57.516 --> 01:10:59.517
I don't want to talk to him.

929
01:10:59.685 --> 01:11:02.520
Good.
Look, you have the number here.


930
01:11:02.688 --> 01:11:04.689
If there's any problem,
call me, okay?


931
01:11:04.857 --> 01:11:07.192
I'll be home
in a couple of hours.


932
01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.860
All right.

933
01:12:02.498 --> 01:12:04.874
- What was that?
- What the hell? Was that our place?


934
01:12:55.092 --> 01:12:57.760
Carly? Ohh.

935
01:12:57.928 --> 01:13:01.222
Oh, my God. Carly.

936
01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:18.406
Christ, she tore
the fucking place apart.


937
01:13:19.533 --> 01:13:22.911
No, she didn't.
You saw it.


938
01:13:23.078 --> 01:13:25.914
She couldn't
have done all this.


939
01:13:26.081 --> 01:13:28.082
We both saw it
with our own eyes.


940
01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:30.251
We stood right there
and saw it, George.


941
01:13:30.419 --> 01:13:31.753
You saw it?

942
01:13:31.921 --> 01:13:34.214
Yes. Yes, we did.
We saw it.


943
01:13:34.381 --> 01:13:35.840
You saw it?

944
01:13:36.008 --> 01:13:38.843
Please forgive me, Carly.
Please?


945
01:13:39.011 --> 01:13:41.513
I never should have
sent you to that clinic.


946
01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.473
- You saw it?
- I'm so sorry.


947
01:13:43.641 --> 01:13:45.517
Please forgive me.

948
01:13:45.684 --> 01:13:49.145
You saw it.

949
01:13:49.313 --> 01:13:50.980
You saw it.

950
01:13:53.275 --> 01:13:55.235
Ohh! You saw it!

951
01:14:16.507 --> 01:14:19.342
Yeah, I need "The Empty Fortress"
and "Love is Not Enough."


952
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:21.511
Carla? Look.

953
01:14:21.679 --> 01:14:24.180
"Improbability
of the Impossible."


954
01:14:25.641 --> 01:14:27.934
"Psychic Self
-Defense."

955
01:14:28.102 --> 01:14:30.603
- Is this a $12.95 book?
- This is great.


956
01:14:30.771 --> 01:14:32.438
You look at that.
I'm going to go over


957
01:14:32.606 --> 01:14:34.315
and check out
the psychology section.


958
01:14:34.483 --> 01:14:35.692
All right.

959
01:14:35.859 --> 01:14:37.402
Let's just look
at Rogers McGibbon, okay?


960
01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:39.195
No. It's just
not that good a case.


961
01:14:39.363 --> 01:14:41.447
There's just not enough independent
verification of the phenomena.


962
01:14:41.615 --> 01:14:44.117
Yeah, but so much of it
fits the classic patterns.


963
01:14:44.285 --> 01:14:46.578
There's cold spots.
There's the smell.


964
01:14:46.745 --> 01:14:48.204
There's objects
moving around randomly,


965
01:14:48.372 --> 01:14:51.332
and, in this case, there is
the appearance of an apparition.


966
01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.877
Yeah, but that's just it.
The appearance of an apparition


967
01:14:55.045 --> 01:14:56.379
and the sudden movement
of objects


968
01:14:56.547 --> 01:14:58.423
just don't occur simultaneously.

969
01:14:58.591 --> 01:15:01.217
Excuse me.

970
01:15:01.385 --> 01:15:03.261
Excuse me. They do.

971
01:15:03.429 --> 01:15:05.430
I have them all.

972
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:09.183
You do?

973
01:15:09.351 --> 01:15:11.019
Everything broke loose
and went crazy,


974
01:15:11.186 --> 01:15:12.520
and everything was shaking.

975
01:15:12.688 --> 01:15:14.355
The bed was shaking,
and the walls were shaking.


976
01:15:14.523 --> 01:15:16.899
Like an earthquake?

977
01:15:17.067 --> 01:15:18.401
No, it wasn't
like an earthquake.


978
01:15:18.569 --> 01:15:19.944
It was much stronger
than any earthquake.


979
01:15:20.112 --> 01:15:21.571
And I tried to get out of here,

980
01:15:21.739 --> 01:15:23.197
and I wanted
to get the kids out,


981
01:15:23.365 --> 01:15:25.033
and I called Bill.
Bill was in his room.


982
01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.243
And then the door slammed.
It was just a horrible thing.


983
01:15:27.411 --> 01:15:29.454
- Where is Billy now?
- He's out in the garage.


984
01:15:29.622 --> 01:15:32.790
- You can talk to him if...
- Door slam like that?


985
01:15:32.958 --> 01:15:35.793
Stronger. Much stronger.

986
01:15:35.961 --> 01:15:37.337
Hmm.

987
01:15:37.504 --> 01:15:39.839
And the bathroom.
This is where...


988
01:15:40.007 --> 01:15:41.633
well, you know
about that attack. And I...


989
01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:44.469
this was the door. It was stuck,
and I couldn't get out of it,


990
01:15:44.637 --> 01:15:46.846
and I tried, and I just
couldn't get out of it.


991
01:15:48.432 --> 01:15:49.849
It was stuck that night.

992
01:15:50.017 --> 01:15:52.185
Yeah.

993
01:15:54.688 --> 01:15:56.356
This is the girls' room.

994
01:15:56.523 --> 01:15:58.816
They're asleep right now,
and I don't want to disturb them.


995
01:15:58.984 --> 01:16:00.360
Did they sleep
through this whole attack?


996
01:16:00.527 --> 01:16:02.362
Yeah, they managed
to sleep through it.


997
01:16:02.529 --> 01:16:04.864
- Sound sleepers.
- They are.


998
01:16:05.032 --> 01:16:06.658
It's one of the good things
about kids.


999
01:16:08.911 --> 01:16:10.953
The living room.

1000
01:16:11.121 --> 01:16:12.789
This is where Billy
got the lightning.


1001
01:16:12.956 --> 01:16:14.624
It was like it was lightning
going into him,


1002
01:16:14.792 --> 01:16:16.250
and he fell down.
He broke his wrist...


1003
01:16:16.418 --> 01:16:17.669
By lightning, you mean
an electrical discharge?


1004
01:16:17.836 --> 01:16:19.170
I don't know what it was.

1005
01:16:19.338 --> 01:16:20.797
It was like lightning
was going into him


1006
01:16:20.964 --> 01:16:22.632
- and I was on the couch.
- Like an arc?


1007
01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:26.302
Was it kind of like...

1008
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:28.596
You don't believe me, do you?

1009
01:16:28.764 --> 01:16:31.307
Mrs. Moran, please understand.
We want to believe you.


1010
01:16:31.475 --> 01:16:33.351
We want to believe you
very much, but it's...


1011
01:16:33.519 --> 01:16:35.812
It's just we want to do it
right, Mrs. Moran.


1012
01:16:35.979 --> 01:16:38.064
- You want some coffee?
- Yeah, sure.


1013
01:16:38.232 --> 01:16:40.191
Yeah. That'd be real nice.

1014
01:16:54.748 --> 01:16:56.207
Oh, my God. Do you smell that?

1015
01:16:56.375 --> 01:16:58.042
Jesus.

1016
01:16:59.044 --> 01:17:00.837
It's awful.

1017
01:17:16.186 --> 01:17:18.688
You see?

1018
01:17:18.856 --> 01:17:20.815
I wasn't lying.

1019
01:17:21.859 --> 01:17:23.359
Mrs. Moran,

1020
01:17:23.527 --> 01:17:27.071
I think it might be worthwhile
after all for us to set up


1021
01:17:27.239 --> 01:17:29.323
some of the equipment
we've got with us in the car.


1022
01:17:29.491 --> 01:17:33.119
Yeah.

1023
01:18:13.327 --> 01:18:14.577
Joe!

1024
01:18:16.413 --> 01:18:18.414
Gene, let's get her out of here!

1025
01:18:18.582 --> 01:18:20.416
Mrs. Moran, are you all right?

1026
01:18:21.835 --> 01:18:23.085
Mrs. Moran?

1027
01:18:28.425 --> 01:18:30.051
Gene, let's get out of here.

1028
01:18:30.219 --> 01:18:31.969
No, don't be frightened.

1029
01:18:33.847 --> 01:18:35.348
He's weak.

1030
01:18:40.813 --> 01:18:43.022
He's weak!

1031
01:18:47.444 --> 01:18:48.778
He can't touch us!

1032
01:18:48.946 --> 01:18:51.113
Gene, shoot it!

1033
01:18:52.115 --> 01:18:54.867
Ha! I don't believe it.

1034
01:18:55.035 --> 01:18:56.828
He can't touch us.

1035
01:18:58.247 --> 01:19:01.749
Die, you bastard! Die!

1036
01:19:04.127 --> 01:19:07.046
Die!

1037
01:19:09.174 --> 01:19:10.800
You can't touch us!

1038
01:19:12.594 --> 01:19:13.970
Die!

1039
01:19:23.146 --> 01:19:24.730
Die.

1040
01:19:28.569 --> 01:19:29.902
He can't hurt me anymore.

1041
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:31.863
Not with you here.
He can't hurt me.


1042
01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:40.037
Oh, thank you, God.

1043
01:19:40.205 --> 01:19:41.664
- Did you see it?
- I think so, yes.


1044
01:19:41.832 --> 01:19:43.082
- Did you get it?
- Yes.


1045
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:45.334
Oh, thank you!

1046
01:19:45.502 --> 01:19:47.211
I'm going to go get the kids.

1047
01:19:47.379 --> 01:19:48.838
Gene, we're going
to need an ion detector.


1048
01:19:49.006 --> 01:19:51.716
Hey, wake up.
Wake up, everybody.


1049
01:19:51.884 --> 01:19:53.217
It's a gorgeous day.

1050
01:19:53.385 --> 01:19:55.553
Gorgeous day.
Come here. Come here.


1051
01:19:55.721 --> 01:19:58.222
Wake up.

1052
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:59.974
Isn't it a beautiful day?

1053
01:20:00.142 --> 01:20:02.685
Isn't it a beautiful day?
Come here.


1054
01:20:05.230 --> 01:20:07.106
Did you check the wiring?

1055
01:20:07.274 --> 01:20:09.734
It could be a short circuit,
current leakage.


1056
01:20:09.902 --> 01:20:11.611
She spoke to it
as if it were real,


1057
01:20:11.778 --> 01:20:14.530
like it were alive
and she knew it.


1058
01:20:14.698 --> 01:20:16.949
Isn't it possible
she was hallucinating?


1059
01:20:17.117 --> 01:20:19.327
How do you photograph
a hallucination?


1060
01:20:19.494 --> 01:20:23.205
This looks like some kind
of electrical discharge.


1061
01:20:23.373 --> 01:20:25.541
What about this forking,
right here?


1062
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:30.004
Couldn't this be a head?
Couldn't this be a shoulder?


1063
01:20:30.172 --> 01:20:32.131
We feel that this photograph

1064
01:20:32.299 --> 01:20:34.383
constitutes proof, Dr. Cooley.

1065
01:20:35.677 --> 01:20:37.219
I don't know.

1066
01:20:38.805 --> 01:20:42.642
Takes a long time before you can
come up with something reliable.


1067
01:20:42.809 --> 01:20:46.103
You have to check
every possible alternative.


1068
01:20:46.271 --> 01:20:48.230
What about the smell?
And the shaking?


1069
01:20:48.398 --> 01:20:50.274
That's classic
poltergeist activity.


1070
01:20:50.442 --> 01:20:52.902
It also could be
a dead cat and a tremor.


1071
01:20:56.114 --> 01:20:57.865
I don't know what
you think you've discovered,


1072
01:20:58.033 --> 01:21:01.494
but you're playing with fire.

1073
01:21:01.662 --> 01:21:04.497
I suggest you start
with the traditional world


1074
01:21:04.665 --> 01:21:06.082
and move outward.

1075
01:21:06.249 --> 01:21:08.584
We'll need more equipment
to do that.


1076
01:21:08.752 --> 01:21:12.088
Maybe I'll authorize it
when the time comes.


1077
01:21:14.883 --> 01:21:16.467
You say she was seeing
a psychiatrist?


1078
01:21:16.635 --> 01:21:17.927
That's right.

1079
01:21:18.095 --> 01:21:20.137
I'd like to know
what the diagnosis was.


1080
01:21:20.305 --> 01:21:22.264
Well, that's no problem.
She was seeing someone right here.


1081
01:21:34.236 --> 01:21:35.736
I got it.

1082
01:21:37.739 --> 01:21:39.782
Get that blue one.

1083
01:21:42.369 --> 01:21:44.370
Yeah, well, we're doing
the best that we can.


1084
01:21:44.538 --> 01:21:45.997
Oh, we got a lot
of people here,


1085
01:21:46.164 --> 01:21:48.207
lot of folks, yeah.

1086
01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:49.709
Well, we're wiring
the place up


1087
01:21:49.876 --> 01:21:51.919
for any kind of movement
that we might get


1088
01:21:52.087 --> 01:21:53.963
and putting
x-ray plates up also.


1089
01:21:54.131 --> 01:21:57.049
No, we're hanging up
wires and stuff.


1090
01:21:57.217 --> 01:21:59.385
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Carla Moran.


1091
01:21:59.553 --> 01:22:01.512
Are you here
to observe the phenomena?


1092
01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.222
Observe the phenomena?

1093
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:05.891
No, I'm Phil Sneiderman.
I'm a resident in psychiatry.


1094
01:22:06.059 --> 01:22:07.893
Carla's my patient.

1095
01:22:08.061 --> 01:22:09.770
Oh, hi. I'm Gene Kraft,
Department of Psychology.


1096
01:22:09.938 --> 01:22:11.272
How do you do?
Nice to meet...


1097
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:13.149
what branch of psych you in?
Clinical? Dr. Morris?


1098
01:22:13.316 --> 01:22:15.359
No. Parapsychology.
Dr. Cooley.


1099
01:22:15.527 --> 01:22:16.861
- Gene.
- Oh, Parapsychology.


1100
01:22:17.029 --> 01:22:19.113
Gene, hand me a roll of tape,
would you, please?


1101
01:22:19.281 --> 01:22:20.448
Yeah.

1102
01:22:20.615 --> 01:22:22.283
What are you guys
doing with all this stuff?


1103
01:22:22.451 --> 01:22:23.701
We're trying to gather
some hard data


1104
01:22:23.869 --> 01:22:25.202
on the phenomena
that's occurring here.


1105
01:22:25.370 --> 01:22:27.413
Oh, really?
I take it you've already


1106
01:22:27.581 --> 01:22:29.040
looked under the beds
and in the closets.


1107
01:22:29.207 --> 01:22:32.043
Yeah. We're leaving
no stone unturned,


1108
01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:33.544
- but thanks for the tip.
- Sure.


1109
01:22:33.712 --> 01:22:35.588
As a matter of fact,
we got some highly interesting


1110
01:22:35.756 --> 01:22:37.089
- electrical formations...
- Did you?


1111
01:22:37.257 --> 01:22:38.591
Possibly caused
by the entity itself.


1112
01:22:38.759 --> 01:22:40.176
The entity?
The entity?


1113
01:22:40.343 --> 01:22:42.595
You know, I hope you guys
will excuse me for saying so,


1114
01:22:42.763 --> 01:22:44.805
but if you guys want
to go on TV talk shows,


1115
01:22:44.973 --> 01:22:46.932
bend spoons, entertain people,
I'm all for that,


1116
01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.268
but this lady is under my care,
and what you're doing isn't helping her.


1117
01:22:49.436 --> 01:22:52.354
Well, thank you very much
for your professional opinion, Dr...


1118
01:22:52.522 --> 01:22:53.856
Sneiderman.

1119
01:22:54.024 --> 01:22:55.524
- Sneiderman.
- Uh-huh.


1120
01:22:56.651 --> 01:22:59.820
- Where's Carla?
- She's in the back.


1121
01:23:03.992 --> 01:23:05.451
Think it is.
I don't think so,


1122
01:23:05.619 --> 01:23:07.078
'cause you haven't
been here during it.


1123
01:23:07.245 --> 01:23:08.829
Just to line it up, huh?

1124
01:23:08.997 --> 01:23:11.165
- Yeah.
- Carla?


1125
01:23:12.959 --> 01:23:15.628
Go over the doorway.

1126
01:23:15.796 --> 01:23:17.296
- Hi.
- Hi.


1127
01:23:18.924 --> 01:23:21.425
Boy, you got a lot of company.

1128
01:23:21.593 --> 01:23:23.427
You missed
your appointment yesterday.


1129
01:23:23.595 --> 01:23:24.970
I was worried about you.

1130
01:23:25.138 --> 01:23:27.473
That's very sweet of you.

1131
01:23:27.641 --> 01:23:29.433
You look terrific.

1132
01:23:29.601 --> 01:23:31.519
I've never felt better,
Dr. Sneiderman.


1133
01:23:31.686 --> 01:23:33.312
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.


1134
01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:36.357
Look, is there someplace
that we could go and talk?


1135
01:23:37.901 --> 01:23:39.610
Yeah.

1136
01:23:41.238 --> 01:23:42.738
I can't blame you
for not coming back.


1137
01:23:42.906 --> 01:23:44.573
I really did push
a little too hard.


1138
01:23:44.741 --> 01:23:46.742
I think you need
to understand something.


1139
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:48.828
I feel very fine now.

1140
01:23:48.995 --> 01:23:50.871
There are no more attacks.
I have no reason to see you.


1141
01:23:52.207 --> 01:23:53.874
Carla, do you remember
that book I showed you


1142
01:23:54.042 --> 01:23:55.918
in the office?
The bats and the dragons?


1143
01:23:56.086 --> 01:23:58.629
That's what those guys
are looking for, fantasies.


1144
01:23:58.797 --> 01:24:00.214
No, they have photographs.

1145
01:24:01.258 --> 01:24:02.883
Okay.

1146
01:24:03.051 --> 01:24:05.886
Look, Carla,
how about you and me,


1147
01:24:06.054 --> 01:24:08.556
we make a bargain, okay?

1148
01:24:08.723 --> 01:24:11.559
You can see me and still...

1149
01:24:11.726 --> 01:24:14.395
have your scientist friends
help you.


1150
01:24:14.563 --> 01:24:16.147
I don't see any point in that.

1151
01:24:16.314 --> 01:24:17.815
Well, it's like seeing
two different doctors,


1152
01:24:17.983 --> 01:24:19.817
you know,
getting different opinions,


1153
01:24:19.985 --> 01:24:21.527
a bone specialist
and a blood specialist.


1154
01:24:21.695 --> 01:24:23.487
- They work together.
- No, I'd rather not.


1155
01:24:23.655 --> 01:24:25.072
Why?
What have we got to lose?


1156
01:24:26.074 --> 01:24:28.325
I believed in you.

1157
01:24:28.493 --> 01:24:29.994
You know I did.

1158
01:24:30.162 --> 01:24:33.289
I really needed to believe in you.
But every time you discovered


1159
01:24:33.456 --> 01:24:35.499
something new about me,
something worse happened,


1160
01:24:35.667 --> 01:24:38.169
and I got sick of hearing
that it would all go away


1161
01:24:38.336 --> 01:24:40.629
as soon as we got down to the basic
problem, as though it was in me.


1162
01:24:41.673 --> 01:24:42.798
It is in you, Carla.

1163
01:24:44.718 --> 01:24:46.635
I think you better leave.

1164
01:24:54.519 --> 01:24:55.895
- Hi, Billy.
- Hi.


1165
01:24:56.062 --> 01:24:58.606
- Billy. Billy!
- Yeah?


1166
01:24:58.773 --> 01:25:00.232
- Look, would you do me a favor?
- What?


1167
01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:02.026
Don't pretend next time.

1168
01:25:02.194 --> 01:25:04.278
The next time your mother
thinks she sees something


1169
01:25:04.446 --> 01:25:06.238
or she hears something,
she wants you to corroborate it,


1170
01:25:06.406 --> 01:25:08.032
and when you do, it's that much
more difficult to convince her


1171
01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:09.867
that it's all in her head,
it's a delusion.


1172
01:25:10.035 --> 01:25:11.493
I didn't get a broken arm
by pretending.


1173
01:25:11.661 --> 01:25:13.120
Look, Billy, there's a lot
of logical explanations


1174
01:25:13.288 --> 01:25:14.788
that could have caused
something like this.


1175
01:25:14.956 --> 01:25:17.208
All I'm telling you, that is,
if you care about your mom,


1176
01:25:17.375 --> 01:25:18.792
you will not pretend next time.

1177
01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.003
I care about my mother, yeah.
But I was not pretending.


1178
01:25:21.171 --> 01:25:22.671
I'm not lying to you.

1179
01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:33.349
Want to know
why she's not coming back?


1180
01:25:33.516 --> 01:25:35.184
- Mm-hmm.
- She's fallen in with some schmucks


1181
01:25:35.352 --> 01:25:37.686
who are supporting her fantasies.
You ought to see her house.


1182
01:25:37.854 --> 01:25:40.564
They're watching her visitations,
got it all wired to look for poltergei...


1183
01:25:40.732 --> 01:25:41.899
- Entities.
- Wait a minute.


1184
01:25:42.067 --> 01:25:43.317
That's what they called it,
an entity.


1185
01:25:43.485 --> 01:25:44.693
- What schmucks?
- I don't know.


1186
01:25:44.861 --> 01:25:46.195
They say they're
from the university here.


1187
01:25:46.363 --> 01:25:47.655
Parapsychology.

1188
01:25:47.822 --> 01:25:49.531
Ooh.

1189
01:25:49.699 --> 01:25:51.116
A Dr. Cooley.

1190
01:25:51.284 --> 01:25:52.618
- Elizabeth Cooley.
- Yeah.


1191
01:25:52.786 --> 01:25:54.286
Parapsychology.

1192
01:25:54.454 --> 01:25:56.956
It's fly-by-night psychology.

1193
01:25:57.123 --> 01:25:58.916
Okay. So how do we
get rid of 'em?


1194
01:25:59.084 --> 01:26:00.417
Well, not very easily.

1195
01:26:00.585 --> 01:26:02.753
I mean, these are
not snake-oil peddlers, Phil.


1196
01:26:02.921 --> 01:26:04.755
These are supposedly
academic brethren.


1197
01:26:04.923 --> 01:26:06.548
Academic brethren, bullshit.

1198
01:26:06.716 --> 01:26:08.425
Come on. They're dangerous.
They're feeding her delusion.


1199
01:26:08.593 --> 01:26:10.052
By the time
they get through with her,


1200
01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:12.221
she's really going to be
off her rocker or worse.


1201
01:26:12.389 --> 01:26:14.306
Well, there's not much
you can do,


1202
01:26:14.474 --> 01:26:17.017
not legally or medically.

1203
01:26:17.185 --> 01:26:20.062
It's her life, her house,
her delusions.


1204
01:26:20.230 --> 01:26:23.065
No, until she crosses
the line of legal sanity,


1205
01:26:23.233 --> 01:26:25.192
nobody can touch her.

1206
01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:50.301
Come on.

1207
01:26:53.054 --> 01:26:55.597
Come on, show yourself,
you coward.


1208
01:26:58.184 --> 01:26:59.852
Now that I've got
my forces here with me,


1209
01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:02.563
let's just see
how brave you are.


1210
01:27:21.458 --> 01:27:24.001
Is that all
you got the guts to do?


1211
01:27:25.628 --> 01:27:28.756
A couple of itty-bitty lights?
Come on.


1212
01:27:28.923 --> 01:27:31.383
We don't want fireworks.
We want you!


1213
01:27:31.551 --> 01:27:33.761
Show yourself, damn you!

1214
01:27:41.519 --> 01:27:44.438
Are you trapped
in this environment?


1215
01:27:47.317 --> 01:27:50.569
Will you appear to us now?

1216
01:27:54.032 --> 01:27:55.616
You won't appear.

1217
01:27:57.118 --> 01:28:00.287
You won't appear, because you're
a devil out of hell,


1218
01:28:00.455 --> 01:28:02.247
and you're afraid.

1219
01:28:04.417 --> 01:28:06.752
You'll wait till I'm alone,
won't you?


1220
01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:10.214
Then you'll come forth to hurt me,
to hurt my children.


1221
01:28:40.745 --> 01:28:47.835
Show yourself.

1222
01:29:26.166 --> 01:29:28.917
Joe, turn on the lights.

1223
01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.760
Did you see it?

1224
01:29:38.928 --> 01:29:41.013
Yes, Mrs. Moran.
We saw it.


1225
01:29:42.891 --> 01:29:44.766
Thank you.
Would you excuse us?


1226
01:29:54.694 --> 01:29:56.528
- Is it over?
- For now.


1227
01:29:56.696 --> 01:29:59.364
Yeah? Are you okay?

1228
01:29:59.532 --> 01:30:01.658
All right. Okay, then I'm going
to go to bed, okay?


1229
01:30:01.826 --> 01:30:03.160
- Okay.
- Good night.


1230
01:30:03.328 --> 01:30:04.995
- Good night.
- I'll see you.


1231
01:30:05.163 --> 01:30:06.788
- Good night, Billy.
- Excuse me.


1232
01:30:10.210 --> 01:30:12.336
Thank you.
We'll be leaving shortly.


1233
01:30:12.504 --> 01:30:14.254
What are you two doing up?

1234
01:30:14.422 --> 01:30:17.257
- Is everything okay?
- We heard you, Mommy.


1235
01:30:17.425 --> 01:30:18.926
Everything's fine.
Come on.


1236
01:30:20.136 --> 01:30:22.804
Well?

1237
01:30:22.972 --> 01:30:26.183
I've never seen
anything like it before.


1238
01:30:26.351 --> 01:30:29.102
Do you think that we were
in some kind of hypnotic state


1239
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:32.272
and that this was
a mass hallucination?


1240
01:30:33.525 --> 01:30:35.859
I've always believed

1241
01:30:36.027 --> 01:30:38.862
that there were several planes
of existence,


1242
01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:41.365
distinct and separate...

1243
01:30:42.909 --> 01:30:46.245
and we, as human beings,
inhabit only one.


1244
01:30:48.164 --> 01:30:52.000
Isn't it possible that some sort
of external intelligence,


1245
01:30:52.168 --> 01:30:54.461
some discarnate entity,

1246
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:57.047
has crossed into
our plane of existence?


1247
01:30:57.215 --> 01:30:58.924
How are we going to prove it?

1248
01:30:59.092 --> 01:31:01.677
We have to isolate it.

1249
01:31:01.844 --> 01:31:04.054
We have to draw it in somehow,

1250
01:31:04.222 --> 01:31:06.890
find a way to bring it into
a controlled situation.


1251
01:31:07.058 --> 01:31:09.184
Yeah, me too.

1252
01:31:09.352 --> 01:31:10.727
- Put it in.
- Okay, we got it.


1253
01:31:13.856 --> 01:31:15.190
Good night, Mrs. Moran.

1254
01:31:15.358 --> 01:31:16.858
- Good night, Mrs. Moran.
- Thank you.


1255
01:31:18.736 --> 01:31:20.696
We've got some real good ideas
on how to proceed.


1256
01:31:20.863 --> 01:31:22.364
Thanks a lot.

1257
01:31:24.409 --> 01:31:27.578
- You've got the tape, right?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.


1258
01:31:30.707 --> 01:31:33.750
- Jerry.
- Hi, cutie.


1259
01:31:33.918 --> 01:31:36.211
Excuse me.

1260
01:31:39.591 --> 01:31:42.259
- What gives?
- Why didn't you call?


1261
01:31:42.427 --> 01:31:45.095
I did. Every time, I got
a different voice on the line.


1262
01:31:45.263 --> 01:31:47.431
What's going on?

1263
01:31:47.599 --> 01:31:50.100
Those people
are from the university.


1264
01:31:50.268 --> 01:31:51.768
The university?

1265
01:31:53.396 --> 01:31:56.189
I missed you.
Look at me. I'm shaking.


1266
01:31:56.357 --> 01:31:58.817
I think we'd better
have a drink.


1267
01:31:58.985 --> 01:32:00.694
Got some good wine.

1268
01:32:00.862 --> 01:32:04.990
Um, yeah, well, you go ahead.
I don't think I'd really better.


1269
01:32:05.158 --> 01:32:06.742
No, no,
you're going to have one.


1270
01:32:06.909 --> 01:32:08.660
This is my homecoming.
Come on.


1271
01:32:10.788 --> 01:32:12.289
What was that all about?

1272
01:32:15.043 --> 01:32:17.044
They're trying to help.

1273
01:32:17.211 --> 01:32:20.589
- Help who?
- Me.


1274
01:32:20.757 --> 01:32:22.257
I don't know what you mean.

1275
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:27.804
I've been sick, Jerry.

1276
01:32:27.972 --> 01:32:30.766
Sick? What kind of sick?

1277
01:32:31.809 --> 01:32:33.769
Things have come to me...

1278
01:32:33.936 --> 01:32:35.520
in the night.

1279
01:32:36.981 --> 01:32:39.816
- Nightmares, you mean?
- Yeah.


1280
01:32:39.984 --> 01:32:42.069
Like nightmares. Exactly.

1281
01:32:42.236 --> 01:32:45.697
I mean, those people
you saw in the house,


1282
01:32:45.865 --> 01:32:47.866
they're psychologists.
They're doctors,


1283
01:32:48.034 --> 01:32:50.869
and they have a theory
that there's something


1284
01:32:51.037 --> 01:32:53.872
in the house that...

1285
01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:55.749
is keeping me from sleeping,

1286
01:32:55.917 --> 01:32:58.877
and they're trying to fix it.

1287
01:33:00.672 --> 01:33:03.048
Some of them looked pretty young
to be doctors.


1288
01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:07.094
- Oh, you're mad.
- No, it's not a question of mad.


1289
01:33:07.261 --> 01:33:09.096
- Yeah, okay, since you ask.
- Yeah, you're mad.


1290
01:33:09.263 --> 01:33:11.848
I mean, who brings
a university full of kids


1291
01:33:12.016 --> 01:33:13.350
into their house
because they can't sleep?


1292
01:33:13.518 --> 01:33:16.395
You can't sleep, you take a pill.
You go see a regular doctor.


1293
01:33:16.562 --> 01:33:18.480
I'm not giving a party, Jerry.
I'm really not.


1294
01:33:18.648 --> 01:33:20.565
Hey, all I'm asking for
is a simple explanation.


1295
01:33:20.733 --> 01:33:22.025
I still don't know
what's bugging you.


1296
01:33:22.193 --> 01:33:23.527
- Yeah.
- Don't treat me like a jerk.


1297
01:33:23.695 --> 01:33:25.153
- I'm not a jerk, okay, Carly?
- I'm sorry.


1298
01:33:25.321 --> 01:33:27.698
Trust me. Just tell me
what the hell's happening.


1299
01:33:30.618 --> 01:33:32.202
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know...


1300
01:33:32.370 --> 01:33:35.205
I don't know the difference

1301
01:33:35.373 --> 01:33:37.165
between what is happening

1302
01:33:37.333 --> 01:33:39.960
and what I think
might be happening.


1303
01:33:40.128 --> 01:33:43.255
The only thing I know for certain
is that it started when you left.


1304
01:33:43.423 --> 01:33:45.507
And I don't say that
with any kind of blame


1305
01:33:45.675 --> 01:33:47.718
or accusation,
but that is when it started.


1306
01:33:47.885 --> 01:33:50.387
When what started, Carly?
What?


1307
01:33:53.057 --> 01:33:54.558
All right.

1308
01:33:56.602 --> 01:33:58.687
Okay. I was...

1309
01:33:58.855 --> 01:34:01.273
I was attacked.
And it's not happening now,


1310
01:34:01.441 --> 01:34:02.733
so don't worry,
but I was attacked.


1311
01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:04.359
You were attacked?
By who? Who attacked you?


1312
01:34:04.527 --> 01:34:05.652
- Nobody. Nobody.
- You were attacked?


1313
01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:06.820
No, nobody. Nobody.

1314
01:34:08.948 --> 01:34:10.782
Nobody you can see.

1315
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:12.325
Oh, God.
This sounds so crazy.


1316
01:34:12.493 --> 01:34:15.287
I mean, it was like
a horrible dream.


1317
01:34:15.455 --> 01:34:17.038
Shit. I don't know
how to explain it.


1318
01:34:17.206 --> 01:34:19.666
It sounds crazy
every time I explain it.


1319
01:34:19.834 --> 01:34:21.918
- Ohh.
- It sounds crazy.


1320
01:34:22.086 --> 01:34:23.754
God, baby.

1321
01:34:24.881 --> 01:34:27.716
Oh, Carla.

1322
01:34:27.884 --> 01:34:29.968
Do you know, for a second,
you had me worried?


1323
01:34:30.136 --> 01:34:31.928
I mean, I thought
you were really attacked.


1324
01:34:32.096 --> 01:34:33.430
I thought that somebody
attacked you.


1325
01:34:37.977 --> 01:34:40.061
Honey.

1326
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:42.522
I know why you can't sleep,

1327
01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:45.066
but I am with you right now.

1328
01:34:46.527 --> 01:34:49.321
I will guarantee you
that these dreams


1329
01:34:49.489 --> 01:34:51.031
or nightmares
or whatever the hell they are


1330
01:34:51.199 --> 01:34:52.991
will never bother you again.

1331
01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:58.038
Because I'm staying this time.
No more trips.


1332
01:34:58.206 --> 01:35:01.041
No more one-night stands, baby.

1333
01:35:01.209 --> 01:35:04.211
Starting tonight,
it's going to be forever.


1334
01:35:15.097 --> 01:35:16.473
Hey.

1335
01:35:16.641 --> 01:35:18.892
Let's go to bed.

1336
01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:20.685
Huh?

1337
01:35:20.853 --> 01:35:22.604
Hey, can we go to your place?

1338
01:35:22.772 --> 01:35:25.982
Uh-uh.
Remember, I'm with you,


1339
01:35:26.150 --> 01:35:28.109
and as long as I am,

1340
01:35:28.277 --> 01:35:30.195
nothing bad is going to happen.

1341
01:35:30.363 --> 01:35:32.155
Do you believe that?

1342
01:35:34.909 --> 01:35:36.493
I got something for you.

1343
01:35:38.579 --> 01:35:40.747
What? What is this?

1344
01:35:40.915 --> 01:35:42.415
You'll see.

1345
01:35:46.587 --> 01:35:48.922
Oh.

1346
01:35:49.090 --> 01:35:51.258
Aw, it's beautiful.

1347
01:35:51.425 --> 01:35:52.968
- Mmm.
- It's pure silk.


1348
01:35:53.135 --> 01:35:54.970
It feels good.

1349
01:35:56.722 --> 01:35:58.640
Go put it on for me.

1350
01:35:58.808 --> 01:36:00.392
Come on.
It's my homecoming.


1351
01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.060
Put it on.

1352
01:36:42.268 --> 01:36:46.021
Look, honey. You know what
I was thinking? If we...


1353
01:36:46.188 --> 01:36:48.064
Please. Help me.

1354
01:36:48.232 --> 01:36:50.025
Help me.

1355
01:36:51.402 --> 01:36:53.153
Help me. Help me.

1356
01:36:53.321 --> 01:36:54.905
Help me.

1357
01:36:55.072 --> 01:36:57.991
Help me. Help me.

1358
01:37:00.161 --> 01:37:01.494
Help me.

1359
01:37:03.122 --> 01:37:05.790
Help me. Help me.

1360
01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:09.377
Please, help me.

1361
01:37:11.672 --> 01:37:13.381
Help me.

1362
01:37:13.549 --> 01:37:15.300
Help me. Help me!

1363
01:37:15.468 --> 01:37:17.010
Help me.

1364
01:37:17.178 --> 01:37:19.971
Help me. Help me.

1365
01:37:29.649 --> 01:37:31.024
Help me. Help me.

1366
01:37:32.318 --> 01:37:33.652
Help me.

1367
01:37:33.819 --> 01:37:36.488
Stop it. Stop it.

1368
01:37:36.656 --> 01:37:37.822
- Get off her.
- Help me.


1369
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:39.824
- Help me.
- Stop it!


1370
01:37:39.992 --> 01:37:42.369
Stop it!

1371
01:37:42.536 --> 01:37:44.329
You son of a bitch!

1372
01:37:46.374 --> 01:37:49.542
You fucking bastard!
You son of a bitch!


1373
01:37:52.421 --> 01:37:54.756
Dr. Bronstein, Dr. Loomis...

1374
01:37:54.924 --> 01:37:56.216
Okay. She's going
to be all right.


1375
01:37:56.384 --> 01:37:57.884
- Yeah?
- She's still a little shaky,


1376
01:37:58.052 --> 01:37:59.928
so when you go in,
don't stay too long, okay?


1377
01:38:00.096 --> 01:38:01.638
- All right.
- Okay. All right. Go in.


1378
01:38:01.806 --> 01:38:03.348
Go in.
She's dying to see you.


1379
01:38:03.516 --> 01:38:04.849
Make a right
at the corner there.


1380
01:38:05.017 --> 01:38:06.351
- First right?
- First door on your right.


1381
01:38:06.519 --> 01:38:07.811
- Thanks a lot.
- You got it.


1382
01:38:07.979 --> 01:38:09.479
Don't stay too long.
Please don't.


1383
01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.192
Okay, Jerry,
she's going to be okay.


1384
01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:16.111
It was just
a slight concussion.


1385
01:38:17.822 --> 01:38:19.823
Thank God for that, Doctor.

1386
01:38:19.991 --> 01:38:21.366
Thank God.

1387
01:38:21.534 --> 01:38:23.201
Look, why don't you
go in and see her?


1388
01:38:23.369 --> 01:38:25.245
She'd like to see you.

1389
01:38:25.413 --> 01:38:27.580
No way, Doctor.

1390
01:38:27.748 --> 01:38:29.833
I can't be around her.

1391
01:38:30.001 --> 01:38:31.459
I can't handle
what's going on in there.


1392
01:38:31.627 --> 01:38:32.877
Come on, Jerry.
What do you mean


1393
01:38:33.045 --> 01:38:34.504
you can't handle it?
She needs you now.


1394
01:38:34.672 --> 01:38:36.506
I mean, I loved her.

1395
01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:41.136
I was going to marry her,
you know.


1396
01:38:41.303 --> 01:38:44.431
I could've taken anything,
I mean, a disease, cancer.


1397
01:38:44.598 --> 01:38:46.850
This is a disease, Jerry.
It's the same thing.


1398
01:38:47.018 --> 01:38:48.268
Not what she's
got living with her.


1399
01:38:48.436 --> 01:38:50.562
Jerry, it's just
a disease now, okay?


1400
01:38:50.730 --> 01:38:52.147
Now just get it
through your head.


1401
01:38:52.314 --> 01:38:53.982
It's just in her head.
There was nobody there.


1402
01:38:54.150 --> 01:38:55.442
Nobody was there.

1403
01:38:55.609 --> 01:38:57.068
Don't tell me that.
There was somebody there.


1404
01:38:57.236 --> 01:38:58.486
- Okay. Okay.
- I mean, there was.


1405
01:38:58.654 --> 01:39:00.196
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.


1406
01:39:00.364 --> 01:39:02.782
I couldn't see him with my eyes,
but there was somebody there.


1407
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:05.660
I see this...

1408
01:39:05.828 --> 01:39:07.704
like something is pressing her.

1409
01:39:07.872 --> 01:39:09.330
It's pushing her.

1410
01:39:09.498 --> 01:39:12.500
I see her breasts
are being touched.


1411
01:39:14.503 --> 01:39:16.713
I mean, I see her breasts
are being squeezed by fingers,


1412
01:39:16.881 --> 01:39:18.715
only I can't see the fingers.

1413
01:39:20.217 --> 01:39:21.968
I'm sorry.

1414
01:39:22.136 --> 01:39:23.845
That's okay. That's okay.

1415
01:39:26.515 --> 01:39:28.433
Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing here?


1416
01:39:28.601 --> 01:39:30.101
We're visiting a friend.

1417
01:39:33.064 --> 01:39:36.149
- I got to go now.
- No, no. Oh, Jerry, look.


1418
01:39:36.317 --> 01:39:38.193
She needs you now.
She needs you now a lot.


1419
01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.028
It's okay. It's okay.
I really have to go.


1420
01:39:40.196 --> 01:39:41.696
Hey, Jerry...

1421
01:39:42.740 --> 01:39:45.700
- Look at me.
- Thanks for calling, Billy.


1422
01:39:45.868 --> 01:39:48.369
- Come on.
- No. I want to stay with Mommy.


1423
01:39:48.537 --> 01:39:50.497
Come on.
We've got to go.


1424
01:39:50.664 --> 01:39:53.041
- I'll talk to you later, Mom.
- Okay.


1425
01:39:53.209 --> 01:39:55.126
I hope you're all right,
Mrs. Moran.


1426
01:39:55.294 --> 01:39:57.378
I'll be back.

1427
01:39:57.546 --> 01:39:59.714
We never should've left
the house. I'm sorry.


1428
01:39:59.882 --> 01:40:03.551
Maybe this doesn't seem
like the best time for this,


1429
01:40:03.719 --> 01:40:05.470
but we're afraid for you.

1430
01:40:07.014 --> 01:40:10.058
We have an idea that might help.

1431
01:40:10.226 --> 01:40:13.812
We want to try to isolate
this thing and immobilize it.


1432
01:40:13.979 --> 01:40:16.272
We need your consent.

1433
01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:19.400
That means going into it
with your eyes wide open.


1434
01:40:19.568 --> 01:40:23.404
What we have in mind
has never been tried before.


1435
01:40:23.572 --> 01:40:26.825
We'll take
every possible precaution.


1436
01:40:31.205 --> 01:40:33.915
I'll do anything...

1437
01:40:34.083 --> 01:40:36.209
to get rid of him.

1438
01:40:39.088 --> 01:40:41.256
That guy Jerry was
her only contact with reality.


1439
01:40:41.423 --> 01:40:43.508
I want those two guys
banished from her life.


1440
01:40:43.676 --> 01:40:46.219
I don't see what I can do.

1441
01:40:46.387 --> 01:40:49.055
Well, go to the dean.
Maybe he can do something.


1442
01:40:49.223 --> 01:40:50.974
Maybe he can
pull those creeps back.


1443
01:40:52.518 --> 01:40:54.269
Do you realize
what you're asking?


1444
01:40:54.436 --> 01:40:56.146
- That's a month-long debate...
- Right.


1445
01:40:56.313 --> 01:40:58.398
And it could get
very complicated.


1446
01:41:00.025 --> 01:41:02.110
All this for Carla Moran?

1447
01:41:04.029 --> 01:41:06.698
Somebody's got
to look after her.


1448
01:41:06.866 --> 01:41:08.950
Let her go, Phil.

1449
01:41:09.118 --> 01:41:12.287
You don't have any choice,
professionally or personally.


1450
01:41:14.832 --> 01:41:18.459
As you can see,
this is a freshly cut rose,


1451
01:41:18.627 --> 01:41:21.462
and this is a container
of liquid helium,


1452
01:41:21.630 --> 01:41:23.882
473 degrees below zero.

1453
01:41:24.049 --> 01:41:25.842
This is the coldest substance
known to man.


1454
01:41:26.010 --> 01:41:27.427
Anything frozen
at this temperature


1455
01:41:27.595 --> 01:41:29.804
will shatter
at the slightest touch.


1456
01:41:45.529 --> 01:41:48.198
What we are seeking
is to determine


1457
01:41:48.365 --> 01:41:50.783
if this entity has mass.

1458
01:41:50.951 --> 01:41:53.161
If in fact this is the case,

1459
01:41:53.329 --> 01:41:55.955
then we should be able
to freeze it,


1460
01:41:56.123 --> 01:41:58.374
verify its objective existence,

1461
01:41:58.542 --> 01:42:00.585
and prove that it isn't
just a psychic projection...


1462
01:42:00.753 --> 01:42:02.170
It's going to work great,
isn't it?


1463
01:42:02.338 --> 01:42:05.089
...but rather an independent
force from some other


1464
01:42:05.257 --> 01:42:08.176
level of reality
that has never been isolated.


1465
01:42:08.344 --> 01:42:10.428
Here she is.

1466
01:42:12.681 --> 01:42:14.682
Mrs. Moran.

1467
01:42:16.894 --> 01:42:18.519
Let me take your bag.

1468
01:42:18.687 --> 01:42:20.730
It's good to see you.

1469
01:42:20.898 --> 01:42:23.900
We're all very excited
to get the experiment under way.


1470
01:42:26.487 --> 01:42:28.863
- Welcome.
- Mrs. Moran.


1471
01:42:29.031 --> 01:42:30.740
See you later.

1472
01:42:33.285 --> 01:42:35.536
Have you made arrangements
for your children?


1473
01:42:35.704 --> 01:42:38.665
- They're with a friend.
- Good.


1474
01:42:38.832 --> 01:42:41.459
Let me show you
to your new house.


1475
01:42:43.587 --> 01:42:45.505
I'm afraid we're not able

1476
01:42:45.673 --> 01:42:48.049
to provide you
with all the conveniences,


1477
01:42:48.217 --> 01:42:51.719
but we hope
you'll find it comfortable


1478
01:42:51.887 --> 01:42:54.889
- and familiar.
- Watch your step.


1479
01:42:58.352 --> 01:43:01.562
I think everyone's done a terrific job
in recreating your home.


1480
01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:03.731
We did use different colors
on the walls.


1481
01:43:03.899 --> 01:43:06.818
And there are other differences.
No light switches.


1482
01:43:06.986 --> 01:43:09.946
We have to control
the electricity.


1483
01:43:10.114 --> 01:43:13.074
This, of course,
is the children's room.


1484
01:43:13.242 --> 01:43:15.451
Yeah, the bed's
in the wrong place.


1485
01:43:15.619 --> 01:43:18.037
Well, doesn't matter.

1486
01:43:18.205 --> 01:43:20.164
There are no ceilings
anywhere in the house.


1487
01:43:20.332 --> 01:43:21.833
That's for
the television monitoring.


1488
01:43:24.795 --> 01:43:26.379
Except, of course,
in the bathroom.


1489
01:43:26.547 --> 01:43:30.591
There is a ceiling,
but no plumbing.


1490
01:43:30.759 --> 01:43:33.261
We'll supply you
with all the water you need.


1491
01:43:33.429 --> 01:43:35.596
That's a chemical toilet.

1492
01:43:38.684 --> 01:43:40.643
Does this look familiar?

1493
01:43:40.811 --> 01:43:42.395
It's a good simulation.

1494
01:43:49.945 --> 01:43:52.280
And remember
not to change in here.


1495
01:43:52.448 --> 01:43:55.033
The television camera
will be watching you,


1496
01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:58.619
and Gene at the controls.

1497
01:44:00.706 --> 01:44:04.459
Now, in the kitchen,
we had a bit of a problem.


1498
01:44:04.626 --> 01:44:07.462
No gas, but we have a hot plate

1499
01:44:07.629 --> 01:44:09.964
and a well-stocked refrigerator.

1500
01:44:10.132 --> 01:44:12.091
It's like camping out.

1501
01:44:17.014 --> 01:44:20.683
Mrs. Moran, I'd like
to show you something now.


1502
01:44:22.853 --> 01:44:24.520
Looks a lot like your house,
doesn't it?


1503
01:44:24.688 --> 01:44:27.315
The living room.
Brought your books.


1504
01:44:27.483 --> 01:44:29.609
Just stand over here with me.

1505
01:44:38.660 --> 01:44:41.954
Mrs. Moran, this is the protected area
that we were talking about.


1506
01:44:42.122 --> 01:44:44.123
It's two pieces of double-thick,
heat-treated glass


1507
01:44:44.291 --> 01:44:46.250
with a vacuum
in between the panes.


1508
01:44:46.418 --> 01:44:49.253
Now, the system is fail-safe.
We can't activate the helium


1509
01:44:49.421 --> 01:44:51.464
until you're safely
behind this enclosure,


1510
01:44:51.632 --> 01:44:54.092
so when we tell you to go
to the protected area,


1511
01:44:54.259 --> 01:44:56.052
we want you to come
directly to this spot


1512
01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:58.846
as quickly as possible,
and we'll take care of the rest.


1513
01:45:06.939 --> 01:45:10.149
Okay?
Now we have to get ready.


1514
01:45:10.317 --> 01:45:12.902
You make yourself
as comfortable as you can,


1515
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:14.904
but you're not alone.

1516
01:45:15.072 --> 01:45:17.532
If you need anything,
don't hesitate to ask.


1517
01:45:20.077 --> 01:45:21.994
I'm not afraid.

1518
01:45:23.497 --> 01:45:25.748
If you can get him,

1519
01:45:25.916 --> 01:45:27.875
I'm not afraid.

1520
01:45:28.043 --> 01:45:30.878
Hey. Where do you think
you're going?


1521
01:45:31.046 --> 01:45:33.214
- Is this the Cooley experiment?
- Yeah.


1522
01:45:33.382 --> 01:45:36.134
Yeah, I'm with the Medical Institute,
Dr. Sneiderman.


1523
01:45:36.301 --> 01:45:38.094
- Go right on in, Doctor.
- Thank you.


1524
01:46:08.792 --> 01:46:10.209
Carla.

1525
01:46:10.377 --> 01:46:12.420
I'd like to talk to you alone.

1526
01:46:12.588 --> 01:46:16.466
Is there any place
that we could go talk?


1527
01:46:20.262 --> 01:46:21.762
That we could talk privately?

1528
01:46:23.056 --> 01:46:24.557
The bathroom.

1529
01:46:35.569 --> 01:46:38.362
This is quite a setup they have.

1530
01:46:38.530 --> 01:46:42.700
They made a natural environment
for him so he'll come here.


1531
01:46:42.868 --> 01:46:45.703
Really? Is that
what they're telling you?


1532
01:46:45.871 --> 01:46:47.288
That's what they're doing.

1533
01:46:47.456 --> 01:46:49.373
Uh-huh.
And you believe them?


1534
01:46:49.541 --> 01:46:51.667
Oh, yes.

1535
01:46:51.835 --> 01:46:55.046
They're dangerous frauds, Carla.
You're their guinea pig.


1536
01:46:57.883 --> 01:47:00.259
Carla, do you know
that there are tanks


1537
01:47:00.427 --> 01:47:01.969
of liquid helium outside?
Did you know that?


1538
01:47:02.137 --> 01:47:03.471
- Mm-hmm.
- You do?


1539
01:47:03.639 --> 01:47:05.097
Do you know
what liquid helium can do?


1540
01:47:05.265 --> 01:47:06.807
- Of course.
- Of course. Really?


1541
01:47:06.975 --> 01:47:09.352
You understand what it means
to stop all molecular motion,


1542
01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:11.604
paralyze atomic particles,
decompose matter?


1543
01:47:11.772 --> 01:47:14.023
- Okay.
- Okay?


1544
01:47:14.191 --> 01:47:16.859
What do you mean, okay?

1545
01:47:17.027 --> 01:47:18.361
I mean I'd rather be dead

1546
01:47:18.529 --> 01:47:21.113
than living the way
I've been living.


1547
01:47:21.281 --> 01:47:23.115
Do you understand that?

1548
01:47:23.283 --> 01:47:25.576
Yes, I can understand that.

1549
01:47:25.744 --> 01:47:28.162
Yes. I also understand

1550
01:47:28.330 --> 01:47:31.165
that I care very much
what happens to you,


1551
01:47:31.333 --> 01:47:33.834
very much.

1552
01:47:34.002 --> 01:47:37.296
And I know that, in your heart,

1553
01:47:37.464 --> 01:47:40.716
you know the difference
between reality and fantasy.


1554
01:47:42.052 --> 01:47:44.262
Carla, look at me. Carla.

1555
01:47:44.429 --> 01:47:45.888
Our reason, our intelligence,

1556
01:47:46.056 --> 01:47:47.473
that's the only thing
that distinguishes us


1557
01:47:47.641 --> 01:47:49.433
between any other species
of animal.


1558
01:47:49.601 --> 01:47:51.269
Carla, I care about you.

1559
01:47:51.436 --> 01:47:53.896
Carla, don't close yourself off now.

1560
01:47:54.064 --> 01:47:57.400
It's real important, real important
that you maintain contact


1561
01:47:57.568 --> 01:48:00.820
with at least one person
that really cares about you.


1562
01:48:02.739 --> 01:48:06.158
- I don't know what you're saying.
- I'll tell you what I am saying,


1563
01:48:06.326 --> 01:48:08.244
that you and I
can make that contact.


1564
01:48:10.330 --> 01:48:13.249
I don't want
to make that contact.


1565
01:48:15.919 --> 01:48:17.503
Okay.

1566
01:48:29.766 --> 01:48:32.602
Hey.
Wait up a minute, will you?


1567
01:48:32.769 --> 01:48:35.229
Really.
I want to talk to you.


1568
01:48:35.397 --> 01:48:37.231
I got to hand it to you.

1569
01:48:37.399 --> 01:48:39.817
You just don't give up.

1570
01:48:39.985 --> 01:48:42.778
Look, get out, and stay out.

1571
01:48:42.946 --> 01:48:45.323
Okay. Now you listen to me,
Buck Rogers, okay?


1572
01:48:45.490 --> 01:48:47.742
If you or your trusty sidekick
harm one hair on her head...


1573
01:48:47.909 --> 01:48:49.368
- Officer.
- I will have your ass in court.


1574
01:48:49.536 --> 01:48:51.412
You're going to be looking
for your ghosts from prison.


1575
01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:52.913
Do you hear me?

1576
01:48:53.081 --> 01:48:55.916
You see this face?
I don't want to see it again.


1577
01:48:56.084 --> 01:48:58.210
- You got it.
- Hey, Mehan,


1578
01:48:58.378 --> 01:49:00.463
you may have them all fooled,
but not me.


1579
01:49:00.631 --> 01:49:02.548
I'm going to nail you
and that little creep.


1580
01:49:04.301 --> 01:49:06.427
I'll tell him.

1581
01:49:06.595 --> 01:49:08.012
Come on. Let's go.

1582
01:49:08.180 --> 01:49:10.348
- Yes, sir.
- Come on.


1583
01:49:14.227 --> 01:49:16.187
Mrs. Moran, we are now going

1584
01:49:16.355 --> 01:49:18.564
to move into
the nighttime mode.


1585
01:49:53.517 --> 01:49:56.102
I want to get it so bad,
I can taste it.


1586
01:49:56.269 --> 01:49:58.396
Hang on, Gene.
Hang on.


1587
01:49:58.563 --> 01:50:00.314
And pray.

1588
01:50:04.903 --> 01:50:06.737
Dr. Sneiderman is here
with me, Frank.


1589
01:50:06.905 --> 01:50:10.449
He tells me Cooley is using some pretty
lethal equipment up there.


1590
01:50:10.617 --> 01:50:14.286
Liquid helium.
God only knows what all else.


1591
01:50:14.454 --> 01:50:17.915
Frank.
Frank, let's not blow our tops.


1592
01:50:18.083 --> 01:50:21.836
I'm just trying
to sound you out on this.


1593
01:50:22.003 --> 01:50:24.839
Yes, I realize
it's your decision.


1594
01:50:27.467 --> 01:50:29.635
I can't figure him anymore.

1595
01:50:29.803 --> 01:50:31.846
Do we really need his approval?

1596
01:50:32.013 --> 01:50:34.765
You need to learn a lot
about campus politics.


1597
01:50:34.933 --> 01:50:37.101
Fuck campus politics.

1598
01:50:38.603 --> 01:50:39.937
Where are you going?

1599
01:50:40.105 --> 01:50:43.023
I'm going to get her away
from those lunatics.


1600
01:50:48.071 --> 01:50:50.865
Why not give her the option
of tripping that glass enclosure


1601
01:50:51.032 --> 01:50:52.700
- herself from down there?
- Too dangerous.


1602
01:50:53.869 --> 01:50:55.369
Hey!

1603
01:50:56.913 --> 01:50:58.622
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Carla!


1604
01:50:58.790 --> 01:51:00.916
- Hey!
- Carla?


1605
01:51:01.084 --> 01:51:02.585
- Carla!
- What?


1606
01:51:02.753 --> 01:51:04.837
Carla, come on. We're getting
out of here right now.


1607
01:51:05.005 --> 01:51:06.338
No, I'm not.

1608
01:51:06.506 --> 01:51:09.467
- Don't do that. Let go of him.
- Get him out of here!


1609
01:51:09.634 --> 01:51:11.385
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Take it easy.


1610
01:51:11.553 --> 01:51:13.304
Nobody has to be hurt.

1611
01:51:13.472 --> 01:51:14.972
Let him go, Officer.

1612
01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:16.474
What is it you want, Doctor?

1613
01:51:16.641 --> 01:51:18.309
I want her out of here, Doctor.

1614
01:51:18.477 --> 01:51:19.935
That is not going to happen.

1615
01:51:20.103 --> 01:51:21.896
If you want to watch
this experiment,


1616
01:51:22.063 --> 01:51:23.898
you go up to the booth.
We have nothing to hide.


1617
01:51:25.358 --> 01:51:27.818
I'm very sorry
this had to happen, Mrs. Moran.


1618
01:51:27.986 --> 01:51:29.320
Everything is going
to be all right.


1619
01:51:29.488 --> 01:51:30.946
Yeah. I just don't like
to see anybody...


1620
01:51:31.114 --> 01:51:32.823
- Just try to calm yourself.
- Hurt.


1621
01:51:32.991 --> 01:51:35.743
He's going to be upstairs
with us in the booth.


1622
01:51:35.911 --> 01:51:39.413
Just try to get some rest.
That's the important thing.


1623
01:51:39.581 --> 01:51:41.749
Okay.

1624
01:51:41.917 --> 01:51:44.919
Okay. Okay.

1625
01:51:56.097 --> 01:51:58.432
Weber. Yeah. Yeah.

1626
01:51:58.600 --> 01:52:00.976
Yeah, all right, Elizabeth.
Take it easy.


1627
01:52:01.144 --> 01:52:02.728
I'll come and get him.

1628
01:52:43.436 --> 01:52:45.563
He's up those stairs, Doctor.

1629
01:52:45.730 --> 01:52:47.231
Thank you.

1630
01:53:25.395 --> 01:53:27.855
- Someone open a door?
- He's here.


1631
01:53:28.023 --> 01:53:31.483
Mrs. Moran,
move to the protected area.


1632
01:53:32.611 --> 01:53:35.946
Mrs. Moran,
move to the protected area.


1633
01:53:36.114 --> 01:53:38.741
Mrs. Moran, move to
the protected area.


1634
01:53:42.162 --> 01:53:44.163
To the protected area.

1635
01:53:46.166 --> 01:53:48.083
Don't be alarmed, Mrs. Moran.

1636
01:53:48.251 --> 01:53:49.668
We're moving
into the emergency mode.


1637
01:53:52.422 --> 01:53:53.756
Don't activate
the compressor yet, Joe.


1638
01:53:53.924 --> 01:53:55.925
- I didn't.
- What do you mean, you didn't?


1639
01:53:56.092 --> 01:53:57.217
It's been tripped.

1640
01:54:36.091 --> 01:54:38.092
Oh, my God.

1641
01:55:00.991 --> 01:55:02.866
- What have you got?
- It's no good.


1642
01:55:03.034 --> 01:55:04.743
Let's run it in parallel.

1643
01:55:57.422 --> 01:55:59.006
All right.

1644
01:56:01.134 --> 01:56:03.844
All right, bastard.

1645
01:56:04.012 --> 01:56:05.888
I've finished running.

1646
01:56:07.599 --> 01:56:09.099
So do what you want.

1647
01:56:12.645 --> 01:56:16.065
Take your time, buddy.

1648
01:56:17.942 --> 01:56:19.735
Take your time.

1649
01:56:19.903 --> 01:56:22.738
Really, I'm thankful
for the rest.


1650
01:56:22.906 --> 01:56:24.990
I'm so...

1651
01:56:25.158 --> 01:56:27.576
tired of being scared.

1652
01:56:28.703 --> 01:56:31.872
So it's all right, it really is.
It's all right.


1653
01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:34.458
You can...

1654
01:56:34.626 --> 01:56:36.418
do anything you want to me.

1655
01:56:36.586 --> 01:56:39.004
You can torture me,
kill me, anything.


1656
01:56:41.549 --> 01:56:43.383
But you can't have me.

1657
01:56:46.012 --> 01:56:47.930
You cannot touch me.

1658
01:56:51.142 --> 01:56:52.643
That's mine.

1659
01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:57.231
For God sakes.

1660
01:57:06.366 --> 01:57:07.741
Carla!

1661
01:57:55.123 --> 01:57:56.999
We got it.

1662
01:57:57.167 --> 01:57:58.667
We got him trapped.

1663
01:58:28.156 --> 01:58:30.407
Oh, my God.

1664
01:58:38.625 --> 01:58:44.296
Carla?

1665
01:58:53.556 --> 01:58:55.682
We lost it.

1666
01:58:55.850 --> 01:58:57.684
We got nothing.

1667
01:59:00.188 --> 01:59:03.023
That's not true.

1668
01:59:03.191 --> 01:59:04.942
We got something.

1669
01:59:07.695 --> 01:59:09.529
We have a witness.

1670
01:59:11.699 --> 01:59:13.367
Isn't that so?

1671
01:59:15.453 --> 01:59:17.371
What?

1672
01:59:17.538 --> 01:59:19.665
You did see it, didn't you?

1673
01:59:21.834 --> 01:59:23.794
Something. I...

1674
01:59:23.962 --> 01:59:25.504
I saw something.

1675
01:59:27.548 --> 01:59:30.342
But I don't know.

1676
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:33.345
I just don't know.

1677
01:59:33.513 --> 01:59:35.597
With all that
going on down there,


1678
01:59:35.765 --> 01:59:37.557
it could have been anything.

1679
01:59:40.561 --> 01:59:43.063
You son of a bitch.

1680
02:00:47.503 --> 02:00:51.423
Welcome home...

1681
02:00:51.591 --> 02:00:54.301
cunt.

1682
02:01:36.511 --> 02:01:39.388
We made it. Come on.
Okay, let's close it.


1683
02:01:39.555 --> 02:01:41.807
Good.

1684
02:01:41.974 --> 02:01:44.393
Now let's get these in.

1685
02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:46.311
- Mommy!
- Mommy!


1686
02:01:46.479 --> 02:01:49.648
Carla, how in the world
did you beat us over here?


1687
02:01:49.816 --> 02:01:52.984
We left right after you called.

1688
02:01:53.152 --> 02:01:55.487
Carla, take this.

1689
02:01:55.655 --> 02:01:58.448
Mmm. I'll pay you back.
I promise you.


1690
02:01:58.616 --> 02:01:59.950
- No.
- Thank you.


1691
02:02:00.118 --> 02:02:01.618
It's a gift.

1692
