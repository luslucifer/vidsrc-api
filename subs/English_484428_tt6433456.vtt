Inspired by events
in Astrid Lindgren's life


2
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.739
Happy birthday Astrid

3
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.659
Happy birthday Astrid
from Class 4A


4
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.099
Dear Astrid Lindgren..

5
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.859
We're a 4th-year class
from Hästhult School.


6
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.339
We want to wish you
a happy birthday-


7
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.739
- and thank you for all your stories..

8
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.259
Ingvar gets the first turn.
(Go on, read it!)


9
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.059
Hi Astrid!

10
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.459
My mum and dad have read
your books to me since 1 was little.


11
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.139
I wonder: How can you write so well
about being a child-


12
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.379
- when you haven't been one
for so long?


13
00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.779
BECOMING ASTRID

14
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.899
"I have chosen him, so that he will
direct his children and his household-


15
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:14.219
"- to keep the way of the Lord
by doing what is right and just.


16
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.819
"Thus the Lord will bring about
his promise to Abraham.


17
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.859
"The Lord said:

18
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.219
"The outcry against Sodom
and Gomorrah is so great-


19
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.659
"- and their sin so grievous-

20
00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.059
"- that I will go down and see-

21
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.139
"- if what they have done is as bad
as the outcry that has reached me.


22
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.859
"The men turned away
and went toward Sodom.


23
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.579
"But Abraham remained
standing before the Lord.


24
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.139
"Then Abraham
turned to the Lord and said:


25
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.179
"Will you sweep away the righteous...

26
00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.659
"... with the wicked?"

27
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.059
Where would you rather live,
Sodom or Gomorrah?


28
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.059
Neither!

29
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.579
In Gomorrah
they only say good morning.


30
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.579
And in Sodom they drink
soda for all eternity.


31
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.859
Thank you, Astrid, that's enough.

32
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.219
It's true!
Good morning. Soda.


33
00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.379
- Good morning, soda.
- The next blasphemer is walking home!


34
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.859
May I?

35
00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:22.099
You're so pretty.

36
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.979
If I were a man,
I'd fall in love with you.


37
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:30.019
I'd see that crazy mind of yours
and fall in love right away.


38
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.059
May I?

39
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.139
Let's dance.

40
00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.899
- I don't think so.
- Yes, let's dance, Berta!


41
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.739
Your father is here.

42
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.939
Nice, sis!

43
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.059
Come on, Gunnar.

44
00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.179
Oh, I...
I just have to scream.


45
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.539
Good morning! Soda!

46
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.819
Good morning, soda!

47
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.099
Good morning, soda!

48
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.619
- Good morning!
- Soda!


49
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.979
Astrid?

50
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.819
You're over an hour late.

51
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.299
What were you thinking?

52
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:16.339
- I came home with Gunnar.
- She did.


53
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:20.939
Gunnar can stay out until 10.
You have to be home at 9.


54
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.979
Why is he allowed to stay out later?

55
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.819
Gunnar is a boy and you're a girl.

56
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.819
- But you say we're all equal before God.
- Don't bring our Lord into this!


57
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:37.699
- You always bring God into everything!
- You'll wake the whole house!


58
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.859
- But if we're all equal before God...
- Astrid...


59
00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:45.779
- ... then there should be no difference.
- Good night.


60
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.699
You're only 16...
Settle down.


61
00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.899
Astrid, get started in the stable.

62
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.939
Let's warm ourselves.

63
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.579
In Jesus' name we gather here
Bless this food, oh Jesus dear


64
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:57.699
And hold in Your protective hand
our home, our king, our fatherland


65
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.579
Amen.

66
00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.579
I saw Reinhold Blomberg today.

67
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:23.139
The "Vimmerby Times" comes out twice
a week now, and he needs an assistant.


68
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.219
- Tell the story about Old Ham.
- Not that again!


69
00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.979
- Please, Astrid!
- I've told it a thousand times.


70
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.579
The editor remembered
your essay that was published.


71
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:42.179
"Life on Our Farm". Written by
Astrid Ericsson, our own Selma Lagerlöf.


72
00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.699
- You don't even know who that is!
- Bless that man.


73
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.499
Blomberg was left alone
with seven children when his wife died.


74
00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.819
Berta says his new wife is crazy.
But now they're getting divorced.


75
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:59.219
- We don't gossip while we eat.
- Good thing there's time between meals.


76
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.379
As I said, I saw Blomberg.

77
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.099
And he's looking for an intern.
He'd like to meet you, Astrid.


78
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.499
I'm sorry?

79
00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:18.539
- You'll still have to do your chores.
- Blomberg wants to meet me?


80
00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.139
Tell him I'll be there.

81
00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.059
VIMMERBY TIMES

82
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.419
Hello, Ĺke!

83
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.779
I'm here to see your father.
Is he at home?


84
00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.819
He's working.

85
00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:42.219
Yes, but I don't understand a word.
The woman is completely mad!


86
00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.139
Come in.

87
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.259
How should I know?

88
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.179
You'll just have to tell her...
Yes, I understand.


89
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.499
I have to go now. I've got an
impatient little intern waiting for me.


90
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.099
Fine. Let's do that.

91
00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.899
Newspaper.

92
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.859
Yes. I'm good at spelling...

93
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.619
I'm a hard worker...

94
00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.019
And I'm happy to work overtime
if you need me to.


95
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.739
Newspaper.

96
00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.419
Yes, newspapers are important.

97
00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:45.459
I always read the newspaper
when my father is finished with it.


98
00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.739
I say: Newspaper.

99
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.659
Newspaper...?

100
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.859
- Typewriter?
- Printer's ink.


101
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.019
- Paper?
- News.


102
00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.299
Light.

103
00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.299
Future.

104
00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.619
Freedom.

105
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:25.939
Yes!

106
00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.299
First write up the obituaries.

107
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.179
Then the birthdays, weddings,
silver anniversaries...


108
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.939
- Father?
- We're working.


109
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.939
And then proof-read these.

110
00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.099
Olivia is here. She's crying.

111
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.379
- Bloody hell...
- Proof-read...


112
00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:59.579
- I need you to sign the papers.
- Why are you coming here now?


113
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.899
- Can you just sign them?
- Oh, please...


114
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.939
- Reinhold...
- I'll never sign them. You know that.


115
00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.699
You got the job! 
Congratulations!

116
00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.059
Really, Berta...

117
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:24.659
- That's a typewriter...!
- Well, type then!


118
00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.059
I don't know if I can!

119
00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:12.299
Hi, Astrid. My name is Lisa.
I write stories, too.


120
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.539
I don't spell very well,
but I don't care.


121
00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.139
When I write, it's as if
everything else disappears.


122
00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:24.339
But in a good way.
I'm alone with my thoughts.


123
00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:28.299
I feel free.
Maybe it's the same for you?


124
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:42.619
I also wrote in
all the special birthdays.


125
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:46.659
And the obituaries. 
Every one of them.

126
00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:53.859
Yesterday I wrote about some boys
who hoisted their friend up a flagpole.


127
00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:57.939
And I wrote a story
about a pregnant girl...


128
00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.699
- She nearly died from eating matches.
Matches?!


129
00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.779
- She ate matches?
- She was pregnant.


130
00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.739
She'd heard that the phosphorus
in the matches would kill the baby.


131
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.659
- But nothing happened to the baby.
- That's enough, Astrid.


132
00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.979
And I proof-read
all of Blomberg's articles.


133
00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.939
Like I said.
Vimmerby's own Selma Lagerlöf.


134
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.219
Astrid Ericsson's
wonderful journey through Sweden.


135
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.579
Enough!

136
00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:50.659
Don't play with your food!

137
00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.099
That's enough.

138
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.899
- Throw harder!
- No more throwing.


139
00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.899
No throwing!

140
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.059
It's raining potatoes!

141
00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:32.339
Hello.

142
00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.979
The editor will be back soon.

143
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.419
Would you like to sit down and wait?

144
00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.859
I've come for my silverware.

145
00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.099
- Not this again, Olivia.
- I really want my silverware.


146
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:04.859
- I don't have it.
- Let go of me!


147
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.499
- Shame on you! Shame!
- Get out! Out!


148
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.179
Let go of me! Ouch!

149
00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.299
Let's go and cheer ourselves up
with some coffee and cake.


150
00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:57.699
We lost our child, our baby.

151
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.659
A little girl.

152
00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.739
There is no greater grief for a woman
than to lose a child.


153
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:20.099
Or for a man, I suppose?

154
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.699
You have...

155
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.179
- What was it?
- Ink.


156
00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:53.499
Here...

157
00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.059
I think this is something that
might interest our female readers.


158
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.739
And that one there might interest
our male readers.


159
00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.499
Blomberg.

160
00:22:15.740 --> 00:22:17.939
No, I'd forgotten!

161
00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.379
Now?!

162
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:25.539
Right... I'm on my way.

163
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:30.939
You take the opening
of the new railroad.


164
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.699
- Me?
- Yes, write up a report.


165
00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:14.859
In America the trains
famously rush by-


166
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.099
- at such tremendous speeds-

167
00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:23.379
- that day and night fly past
in a blur of black and white streaks.


168
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.139
But not this train..

169
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:32.859
It rolled along
at just the right pace-


170
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.059
- for us all to delight in the
beautiful countryside of Smĺland.


171
00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:45.579
From time to time we would arrive
at a little red station house-


172
00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:50.419
- with endless streams of bunting
and decorations...


173
00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:56.299
where crowds of people
had gathered to watch...


174
00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.419
...and wave.

175
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.259
You really can write.

176
00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.139
You're a star.

177
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.579
Shine a little on me.

178
00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:18.819
I need it

179
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.379
Like her. That's how
I want my hair. Just like this.


180
00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.099
Do it.

181
00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.259
I have a new hairstyle.

182
00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:56.139
I'll say!

183
00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:01.339
My mother thinks this haircut
is a one-way ticket to hell.


184
00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:07.139
I think God has more important concerns
than a pretty secretary's hair.


185
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.779
I'll be at the print shop.

186
00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:46.739
Why aren't you asleep?

187
00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.739
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.


188
00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.179
Yes, I see.

189
00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.059
Yes.

190
00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.419
Yes, I understand.

191
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:36.459
Is something wrong?

192
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.779
This is not a good idea.

193
00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.699
You should go home now.

194
00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.779
Shall we dance?

195
00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.939
No, I think I'll go home.

196
00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.739
The proof-reading?

197
00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:44.099
- Done.
- The adverts?


198
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.779
- They're right there.
- Right...


199
00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:01.899
And my bedroom?

200
00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:48.979
Newspaper.
I say "newspaper...


201
00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:55.499
- "Vimmerby Times".
- Talented young female journalist.


202
00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.219
Astrid?

203
00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.419
We're all tired.
But we just have to push on.


204
00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:28.379
The smoke is making me sick.

205
00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.339
What's wrong?

206
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:42.819
Is it that time of the month?

207
00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:48.899
Go home and lie down for a while.

208
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.819
It's quiet here today.

209
00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.099
Hey...

210
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.619
What is it?

211
00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.099
My period hasn't come.

212
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:59.659
How long ago was it?

213
00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.339
You promised me you'd be careful!

214
00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.579
I won't leave you.

215
00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.619
Are your breasts sore?

216
00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.259
And you're tired?

217
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.979
Do you feel sick?

218
00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.299
Not so much anymore.

219
00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:44.619
Take off your dress.

220
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.659
And your petticoat.

221
00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.979
Astrid...

222
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:16.419
We live next to the vicar.
Your father is the churchwarden.


223
00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:19.019
- We live off the bounty of church land.
- Yes.


224
00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:22.379
- No one must find out!
- No.


225
00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.819
- Don't say a word to anyone.
- No.


226
00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.739
Is that understood?

227
00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.299
Put your clothes on.

228
00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:55.339
Go to your room.

229
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.219
My deepest apologies.

230
00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:26.339
I have no excuse for this.
I take full responsibility.


231
00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.739
My situation is unfortunately
rather complicated.


232
00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.099
I'm still only separated from Olivia,
and she's taken me to court.


233
00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:42.219
But when my divorce is settled,
everything will be much easier.


234
00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:44.139
Easier?

235
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:49.059
I've found a clinic where Astrid
can have the baby in full discretion.


236
00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:52.299
I assure you of my good intentions..

237
00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:58.379
We could pledge ourselves to each
other now, discreetly of course.


238
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.619
As long as the parents are pledged
to each other, the child is legitimate.


239
00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:11.219
- The child will bear my name.
- We know very well What a pledge means.


240
00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.779
She's dazzling.

241
00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.939
She's truly gifted.
Full of life and energy.


242
00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:25.099
I love Astrid.

243
00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:07.299
It went well.

244
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:18.139
I need to leave town.
I can't stay. What...


245
00:40:19.260 --> 00:40:22.939
What will I do
when my stomach starts growing?


246
00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.219
I won't be able
to show myself anywhere.


247
00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.739
- You have to help me.
- You can go to Stockholm.


248
00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.779
Take that secretarial course
we've talked about.


249
00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.339
Hey...

250
00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.419
This is from Mother.
Some bread, cheese and sausage.


251
00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:30.699
You can do this.

252
00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.259
Dear Astrid. My name is Jenny..

253
00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.859
You write a lot about death..

254
00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:37.059
There are lots of dead people
in your stories. Pippi's mother...


255
00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.499
Jonathan dies, Karl dies..

256
00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.419
Mio's mother is gone, too..

257
00:42:44.580 --> 00:42:49.139
But when I read about it
in your books, I just want to live.


258
00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:52.259
You just want to live..

259
00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:59.819
Stenography is a secretary's
most important tool.


260
00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.459
It's much faster than...

261
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:53.779
- Hello.
- Hello.


262
00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:56.499
- Hello, Astrid!
- Hello, Anna.


263
00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:02.979
- Hello.
- Hello.


264
00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:14.219
- Isn't it cold enough in here already?
- She's cooking fish again.


265
00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.179
Astrid, we're out of firewood.

266
00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:28.219
Look, I made you a hat.

267
00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.659
Anna's having a party.

268
00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:34.699
- She has firewood and a gramophone.
- Saga...


269
00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:48.219
- What is it?
- I'm tired.


270
00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.859
"The Road to Freedom".

271
00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:19.579
That woman on the front page,
Eva Andén, is a lawyer.


272
00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.259
- A female lawyer?
- Yes.


273
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.939
She helps pregnant women.

274
00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.499
Anna had hers in Copenhagen.

275
00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:33.699
Eva Andén found her a foster family.
She helps everybody.


276
00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:39.339
- Where's the baby now?
- I don't know.


277
00:45:42.260 --> 00:45:45.899
- She doesn't know where her baby is?
- Get the door!


278
00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:51.179
- Telegram for Ericsson.
- Ericsson.


279
00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:04.539
"Astrid, phone me.
I must see you. Yours. "


280
00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.219
I think my fiancé misses me.

281
00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:30.259
Hello.

282
00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:35.499
My husband is expecting me.
Gustafsson. Axel Gustafsson.


283
00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:39.819
Your husband is in room 218.
First floor.


284
00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.459
Aren't you feeling well?

285
00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:32.979
It's a bloody circus here.

286
00:47:35.060 --> 00:47:37.419
Olivia has heard rumours.

287
00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:41.339
She wants me locked up.

288
00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:45.299
- What do you mean?
- Adultery.


289
00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.819
I could go to prison.

290
00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.779
Prison?

291
00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:57.299
She's had the court
postpone the divorce.


292
00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:00.739
She wants to prove
that I got you pregnant.


293
00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:06.579
Wherever you have the baby,
you must give the father's name.


294
00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:10.379
They just have to look in
the church records: Reinhold Blomberg.


295
00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:12.859
They'll have their proof.

296
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.859
What will I tell my children?

297
00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.379
No mother...

298
00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.539
and their father in prison.

299
00:48:30.420 --> 00:48:32.659
Listen...

300
00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:51.979
You know what...

301
00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:59.499
Let's see if we can find
something to eat.


302
00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.779
Reinhold.

303
00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:07.859
Come now.

304
00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:49.579
One of the girls at the boarding
house had her baby in Denmark.


305
00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:53.419
And she didn't have
to give the father's name.


306
00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:11.579
The baby can stay
with a foster mother in Denmark.


307
00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:17.099
Until your court case is over.
And I can go back to Vimmerby.


308
00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:22.899
Then you can get divorced
and we can be married.


309
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:27.739
And then we'll bring the baby home.

310
00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:20.139
Passport, please.

311
00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.579
- I'm sorry?
- Your passport.


312
00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:52.059
Here we are.

313
00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.419
Mum! I'm here with Astrid Ericsson!

314
00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:20.659
- Marie.
- Astrid Ericsson, hello.


315
00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:23.819
Did you have a good trip?

316
00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:28.339
That's Esse, my other Swedish
foster child. Can you take him, Carl?


317
00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:30.579
(In Swedish)
You can hang your coat here.


318
00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:37.539
- So you speak Swedish?
- You're not my first Swedish girl.


319
00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:42.139
Let me show you where you're staying.

320
00:52:50.340 --> 00:52:53.619
Go ahead and lie down,
you must need a rest.


321
00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:59.819
Are your legs swollen?

322
00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:06.779
May I feel
if the baby has turned properly?


323
00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.419
Yes, go ahead.

324
00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.699
I'm just going to put my hand here.

325
00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:28.859
Here's the head...

326
00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.739
Here, feel it.

327
00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.099
That's a little knee.

328
00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:49.859
It's a lively little person.

329
00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:01.179
Breathe, breathe!

330
00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.219
Lie back and breathe.

331
00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:11.379
- I can't do it.
- Next time, hold your breath.


332
00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.899
Good job! Keep going!

333
00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:18.299
With all your strength.

334
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.739
Hold your breath
and try again. Come on.


335
00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:26.059
I can see the head!
Another push now...


336
00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:30.259
Breathe, breathe!

337
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.419
And take a break. Good work.

338
00:54:36.620 --> 00:54:40.059
Now sit up and breathe, and pant.

339
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:45.419
It's coming now. It's coming.
Get ready to push.


340
00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.819
Hold your breath, come on.

341
00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.099
Breathe out, breathe out.

342
00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.059
That's it.

343
00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:59.699
- Here it comes.
- It's beautiful.


344
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:05.059
It's a handsome boy.

345
00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:44.419
My little boy...

346
00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.859
Hello!

347
00:55:56.420 --> 00:55:59.099
Hello there, little one.

348
00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.819
Here...

349
00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:32.219
If you'll hold it down... There...

350
00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:48.059
Everyone will know something's wrong
if I don't come home for Christmas.


351
00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:56.499
Now it might hurt a lot
over the next week or so-


352
00:56:56.700 --> 00:57:01.579
- but don't expel the milk,
because then you'll keep producing more.


353
00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:41.979
I'll come for him
as soon as the court case is over.


354
00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:44.819
I'll come as soon as I can.

355
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.339
Hurry, or you'll miss your train.

356
00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:13.499
You can do this.

357
00:58:13.700 --> 00:58:16.059
Go on.

358
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:00.139
Lift up your arms.

359
00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:52.099
He was christened at the hospital.

360
00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:55.899
His name is Lars.

361
01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.739
I think I'll call him Lasse, though.

362
01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:08.739
I'll come and put the bandages back on
before we leave.


363
01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:38.379
"There were shepherds in the same
country, watching their flocks by night.


364
01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:41.699
"An angel of the Lord
appeared before them-


365
01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:45.739
"- and the glory of the Lord
shone round about them.


366
01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.899
"And they became very afraid.

367
01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:53.179
"And the angel said unto them:
Fear not-


368
01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:58.019
"- for behold, I bring you
good tidings of great joy.


369
01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:02.899
"For unto you was born this day
in the City of David, a Saviour...


370
01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:06.179
which is Christ the Lord. "

371
01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:10.699
"And this shall be a sign unto you:
Ye shall find the babe"...


372
01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:14.899
TOMORROW 10 O'CLOCK
AT THE LAKE


373
01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:16.939
"And suddenly there was with the angel-

374
01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:21.579
- a multitude of the heavenly host
praising God"...


375
01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:49.059
I love you.

376
01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:55.739
- I love you, Astrid.
- When will the court case be over?


377
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.899
- Soon.
- Oh God...


378
01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.819
That little darling.
That little darling!


379
01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:09.939
- I have a Christmas present for you.
- What have I done?


380
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.899
You need to keep warm.

381
01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.819
It's beautiful.

382
01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:32.299
You haven't lost him.

383
01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:39.299
He's just in Denmark.
We'll visit him just as soon as we can.


384
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.379
- Our son.
- Our son.


385
01:02:44.740 --> 01:02:46.939
Darling.

386
01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:18.059
You don't have to marry him.

387
01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.619
You don't have to.
You'll be a secretary soon.


388
01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:32.299
You really want to be stepmother to
Berta and all her brothers and sisters?


389
01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:37.259
Do you love him?

390
01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.339
You don't have to, Astrid.

391
01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:50.059
You could leave the child in Denmark,
come home and forget all of this.


392
01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:58.219
You want me to abandon my baby?

393
01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:06.859
Isn't his foster mother
a good mother to him?


394
01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:14.139
Do you love him?

395
01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:49.179
He's over there.

396
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.979
Here he is...

397
01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.539
He's got so big!

398
01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:17.579
- Why don't you pick him up?
- He's really grown!


399
01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:23.899
Hello!

400
01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:29.659
Hello, Lasse!

401
01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:40.179
Let me see him. Come here!

402
01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.099
What a handsome boy!

403
01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:55.499
Look!

404
01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:05.899
I'm glad you came.
Not many do.


405
01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.619
We'll come and get him
as soon as all this is over.


406
01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:42.139
Swedish Book Depository Radio Division.
This is Astrid Ericsson.


407
01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.659
I'll put you through.

408
01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.619
Mr Nilsson for Mr Karlsson.

409
01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.699
- Swedish Book Depository Radio Division.
- It's me.


410
01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.859
How can I help you?

411
01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.899
Somebody saw us at the hotel.

412
01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:23.219
Olivia's hired a handwriting expert to
examine my letters to the birth clinic-


413
01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:26.299
- to prove that I'm Axel Gustafsson..

414
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.339
She's got the judge
to postpone the hearing.


415
01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.099
I see.

416
01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:40.579
You said I could bring him home.

417
01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:45.579
I know. I'll send you money
so you can visit him.


418
01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:52.379
- Lasse is six months old now!
- I know.


419
01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:58.739
Marie has just written
that he can sit up on his own!


420
01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:04.259
I miss you.

421
01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.459
Hello?

422
01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:13.819
Thank you for your call, Mr Gustafsson.
I'll see what I can do.


423
01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.499
What is it?

424
01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:41.099
Marie? I think he's hungry again.

425
01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:50.699
Are you already hungry again,
little Lasse?


426
01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:55.979
- He just needs a new nappy.
- Again?


427
01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.899
Yes, it's an endless source.

428
01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.419
Let's see, Lasse...

429
01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:11.579
I think it opens here...

430
01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:15.099
No... no, like this...

431
01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.499
That's better, isn't it?

432
01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:30.899
When we get back, we'll put a bit
of talcum powder on his bottom.


433
01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:39.299
Marie, I don't know
what I'd do without you.


434
01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.179
The clock is ticking, Astrid.

435
01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:11.339
The children in your books
can overcome almost anything.


436
01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:15.299
Pippi gets along
without her mother and father.


437
01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:19.939
Emil is never scared, even when he gets
punished and locked in the woodshed.


438
01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.779
MO is starving
and thinks he's going to die,


439
01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:30.299
but he wins out
over evil in the end..

440
01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:35.059
That's what I want to be,
someone who never gives up-


441
01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:39.579
- but keeps fighting,
even if I'm hungry and feel alone.


442
01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:11.499
- Hello.
- Hello.


443
01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.499
I was found guilty of adultery.

444
01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:31.819
I was fined 1,000 kronor.

445
01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:36.259
1,000 kronor?

446
01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.419
- You're not going to prison?
- No.


447
01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:49.739
Evidently it's cheap
to be a philanderer.


448
01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.979
But you said that you risked
going to prison.


449
01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:59.059
I got away with a fine,
so it all worked out.


450
01:12:03.980 --> 01:12:07.939
- So I can bring Lasse home?
- You can bring Lasse home.


451
01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:34.339
I've booked us a room.

452
01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:46.539
We're free, Astrid. We can do
whatever the hell we want.


453
01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:11.459
Marry me.

454
01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:32.259
We can have a spring wedding.
With blossoming apple trees!


455
01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:38.579
- It's way too big.
- Darling...


456
01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:42.819
I'll get the jeweller to adjust it.

457
01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:48.179
- You have to see the drawings.
- Drawings?


458
01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:54.219
We'll redo the house
so you can have a new kitchen.


459
01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:57.379
Berta will move
up to the attic room.


460
01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:01.179
Then Lasse can have her old room.

461
01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:05.619
So you can comfort him
if he cries in the night.


462
01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:13.179
Darling?
Come here. Come and see.


463
01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:21.979
- You said you could end up in prison.
- Yes.


464
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:26.659
And all this was just for money?
For 1,000 kronor?


465
01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:30.299
I couldn't have known that.

466
01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:36.259
- Lasse's been hidden away for a year!
- That was your idea.


467
01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:40.939
I didn't ask you to take him to Denmark!
That was your lady lawyer.


468
01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:46.979
Hey... Darling...

469
01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:49.419
Why can't we just be happy?

470
01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:55.779
- Redo the kitchen and start a family?
- I'm sorry, I can't.


471
01:14:55.940 --> 01:14:59.019
- I love you.
- I can't.


472
01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:03.819
I just need some time to think.

473
01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:17.539
- Tell me what I've done wrong!
- You're hurting me!


474
01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:22.259
What do you need to think about?

475
01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:27.059
You can't look after a child.
You can barely afford food.


476
01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.259
- You realise the bank is closing now?
- Yes.


477
01:15:31.700 --> 01:15:34.299
- Damn it...
- That hurts!


478
01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:39.099
Tell me what I've done.

479
01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:42.779
Am I too old?

480
01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:51.299
How will you manage without me?

481
01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:16.099
I can't come, Marie.
I don't have any money.


482
01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:20.339
No. I'm sorry to hear about you two..

483
01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:24.139
- How is Lasse?
- He's fine.


484
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:26.659
He can stay as long as you like..

485
01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:30.939
- Could I hear his voice?
- Lasse, say hello to Lassa-mama.


486
01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:35.819
- Hello, Lasse! Are you doing okay?
- No.


487
01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:39.179
- Tell her what you and Esse did today. '
- No!


488
01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:44.379
- I can't afford to talk anymore, Marie.
- Of course.


489
01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:48.859
Come now, Lasse.
Say bye-bye to Lasse-mama.


490
01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:52.979
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.


491
01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:32.059
How did the interview
with the Royal Automobile Club go?


492
01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:35.379
I hope it went well.

493
01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:40.579
If I get it I can afford a flat of
my own. Then Lasse can live with me.


494
01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:44.699
What book did you get?

495
01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:48.859
- "Hunger" by Hamsun.
- Let me see.


496
01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:01.499
"I had reached hunger's joyful madness.

497
01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:06.379
"I was empty and without pain,
and my thoughts were untrammelled. "


498
01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:17.419
You couldn't get a simple love story?

499
01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:35.299
- The yearbook. I asked for...
- They're ready now.


500
01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:39.899
One moment. I asked
for these captions to be corrected.


501
01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:43.059
And this hasn't been proof-read.

502
01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:49.139
That's the old manuscript.
This is the proofed and corrected one.


503
01:18:57.700 --> 01:19:00.899
This manuscript
is to be sent to the printer.


504
01:19:02.340 --> 01:19:05.099
Yes, and a messenger is on his way.

505
01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:10.099
- In other words, everything's in order.
- Yes.


506
01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:14.979
Excellent, thank you.

507
01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:24.979
- How old is your son?
- He's two and a half.


508
01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.259
I can look after him
while you work.


509
01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:33.299
My daughter has a child's bed
that we don't use anymore.


510
01:19:34.780 --> 01:19:39.899
The toilet is in the courtyard
and there's a bathhouse near the park.


511
01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:43.539
The kitchen is at the end of the hall.
Excuse me...


512
01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:56.219
Don't you think
Lasse will be happy here?


513
01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:01.339
- Just the red ones!
- Okay.


514
01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:09.259
Just pick the very reddest ones.

515
01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:14.819
- Look at mine, Mum!
- Aren't they nice!


516
01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:20.419
He hears Carl calling me Mum.

517
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:24.379
Esse calls me Mum too.

518
01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:27.299
But we talk a lot about you,
Lasse-mama.


519
01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:37.099
Marie... Should I tell him?

520
01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:43.579
I think it's best if we do it together,
tell him he's going to live with you.


521
01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:50.459
- What will we say?
- That you've found a place to live.


522
01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:54.579
He knows you're his mother.

523
01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:09.059
Look how many you've picked!

524
01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:12.859
Look how many you've picked!

525
01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.699
Can you take this?

526
01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:28.339
I'll tuck Esse in
and Lasse-mama will tuck Lasse in.


527
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.619
No!

528
01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:34.099
Come.

529
01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:38.099
- No!
- Come now. She's here today.


530
01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:44.339
- No!
- I can tell really good stories!


531
01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:47.659
Lassen.
Go to Lasse-mama now.


532
01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:55.179
I want you to tuck me in, Mum!

533
01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:06.939
It's been a long day, he's tired.
I'll put him to bed.


534
01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:09.219
Carl, can you take care of Esse'?

535
01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:14.059
- Can you say goodnight, Lasse-mama?
- Goodnight, Lasse-mama.


536
01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.499
Goodnight.

537
01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:24.499
I want to sleep in your bed, Mum.

538
01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:06.339
I'm not his mother, Marie.

539
01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:11.059
- You are his mother.
- Marie, he doesn't know me!


540
01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:14.179
He doesn't even know me!

541
01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:23.379
Can't you see that this is his home?

542
01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:29.819
That you're the one he loves?

543
01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:38.819
You gave birth to him.
You're his mother.


544
01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:41.619
I've just looked after him.

545
01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:45.859
This is his home.

546
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:51.059
Mum?

547
01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.299
He's calling you.

548
01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:01.779
Mum!

549
01:24:27.820 --> 01:24:30.419
Can you say goodbye?

550
01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:35.859
I'm going now.

551
01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:46.659
Lasse, can you say goodbye
nicely to Lasse-mama?


552
01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:53.739
Shall we say goodbye, Lasse?

553
01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:49.739
Welcome to the annual party
of the Royal Automobile Club.


554
01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:53.579
I assure you that we'll soon be eating.

555
01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:58.779
But before that,
I think we should raise our glasses-


556
01:25:58.940 --> 01:26:04.179
- and drink a toast to another good,
prosperous year for motoring.


557
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:06.499
Cheers!

558
01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:16.339
Still toasting motoring?

559
01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:22.419
And thank you for the notes.

560
01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:25.659
They were more entertaining
than the actual meetings.


561
01:26:25.820 --> 01:26:28.579
Long live motoring!

562
01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:39.619
Excuse me a moment.
Oops, sorry.


563
01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:47.299
May I?

564
01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:22.139
- Should I call you a cab?
- No.


565
01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:24.979
- Are you sure?
- Yes.


566
01:30:02.780 --> 01:30:05.099
Get up.

567
01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.899
You did the right thing.

568
01:30:48.780 --> 01:30:51.219
You've grown big.

569
01:30:54.780 --> 01:30:57.979
Astrid?

570
01:30:58.100 --> 01:31:00.979
Come here. Come now.

571
01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:15.859
- What is it?
- This came for you.


572
01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:48.339
Marie is ill.

573
01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:51.099
It's serious.

574
01:31:53.100 --> 01:31:56.779
She's asking what I want to do
about Lasse.


575
01:31:56.980 --> 01:31:58.819
Do about him?

576
01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:02.739
It's serious.
She can't look after him anymore.


577
01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:10.539
You must stay strong.

578
01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.859
But he's my son!

579
01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:19.219
He has no one else in the world!

580
01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:27.219
Are you not my mother?

581
01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:32.379
Isn't he your grandson?

582
01:32:56.900 --> 01:33:02.259
- She only wants what's best for you.
- Do you think I should abandon him?


583
01:33:02.460 --> 01:33:07.979
Your mother worries about you.
She thinks about you night and day.


584
01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:12.139
Are you my father?
Is he your grandson?


585
01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.899
I don't know what to say.

586
01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:25.219
You don't know what to say?

587
01:33:25.380 --> 01:33:29.699
You're my father
and you don't know anything?


588
01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.139
Guess what!

589
01:33:33.300 --> 01:33:38.779
I'm not coming back until I'm welcome
with my son! Your grandson!


590
01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:41.499
Do you understand that?

591
01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.859
Marie?

592
01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:10.059
Hello.

593
01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:19.739
I can't look after him anymore.

594
01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:28.179
I don't know if I can...
I can't do this without you.


595
01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:36.819
You must be his mother.

596
01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:41.939
You can do this.

597
01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:46.779
Children just need love.

598
01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:52.019
Lots of love.

599
01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:54.979
And you have that.

600
01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:07.819
- I can't do it, Marie.
- Yes, you can.


601
01:36:09.300 --> 01:36:12.379
Lasse-mama.

602
01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:24.299
You can do it.

603
01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:39.499
Ht Astrid..

604
01:36:39.700 --> 01:36:44.699
I've thought an awful lot about what
you wrote in The Brothers Lionheart.


605
01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:49.259
That there are things
you just have to do.


606
01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:54.259
Sometimes I have to defend
my little brother against other boys.


607
01:36:54.420 --> 01:36:57.139
It's hard, but I have to..

608
01:36:58.260 --> 01:37:02.179
If I didn't, I wouldn't be a person,
but a little piece of dirt,


609
01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:04.899
and 1 don't want to be that..

610
01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:33.539
Come here.

611
01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:48.259
I've borrowed a nice bed for you.

612
01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:50.899
Lasse's very own bed.

613
01:37:55.100 --> 01:37:57.819
We have our own entrance.

614
01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:04.859
Tomorrow we can go to the park.

615
01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:11.299
And see if we can find
a good tree to climb.


616
01:38:21.820 --> 01:38:25.139
Lasse, are you hungry?

617
01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:28.059
I can't understand you.

618
01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:33.499
(In Danish)
Are you hungry?


619
01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:38.059
(In Danish)
Are you hungry, Lasse?


620
01:38:38.220 --> 01:38:40.939
I miss my mum.

621
01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:51.299
Come here...

622
01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:09.059
See that? Those are blackberries.

623
01:39:10.420 --> 01:39:14.059
You can eat them.
Have one.


624
01:39:19.060 --> 01:39:21.739
Oh, I'm so hungry!

625
01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:28.659
Here's some crisp bread...

626
01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:39.379
I want to go home to my mum.

627
01:39:59.180 --> 01:40:02.299
Look over there, Lasse! Swings!

628
01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:15.339
Why don't you go and try swinging?

629
01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:24.659
Isn't there anything you'd like to do?

630
01:40:31.700 --> 01:40:34.499
Do you want to go home?

631
01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:43.699
Lasse... eat something.

632
01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:48.739
I don't like it.

633
01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:51.139
You know what this is?

634
01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:55.739
It's crocodile pâté,
made from real crocodiles.


635
01:41:01.100 --> 01:41:03.939
Why don't we pretend that I'm Marie?

636
01:41:05.540 --> 01:41:11.179
(in Danish)
Lasse, eat your food like a big boy.


637
01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:15.699
And drink your milk.
Just like a big boy.


638
01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:22.059
You talk strange.

639
01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:28.459
That's because I'm Swedish.
And you're Swedish too.


640
01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:30.859
No!

641
01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:34.819
Lasse is Swedish,
and Astrid is Swedish.


642
01:41:36.460 --> 01:41:39.979
- And I'm your mother.
- No, you're not.


643
01:41:40.180 --> 01:41:43.299
Lasse, now eat your dinner
and then we'll play.


644
01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:52.659
Lasse, I'm your mother
and you'll do as I say!


645
01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:16.579
There there, Lasse.

646
01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:29.699
There, there...

647
01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:33.259
Come here...

648
01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:12.059
Am I interrupting?

649
01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:21.739
I was just about to write...
Sorry, Mr Lindgren...


650
01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:24.539
Come with me.

651
01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:35.099
There are a lot of spelling mistakes
in this morning's letter.


652
01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:39.939
The motoring holiday book
hasn't been sent. It's not like you.


653
01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:46.659
It's my son...

654
01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:54.059
He coughs and coughs.

655
01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:58.699
And I'm not getting any sleep
because I'm afraid he's going to die.


656
01:43:58.900 --> 01:44:02.099
I'll finish typing those letters.

657
01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:08.499
- I'm sending you home.
- You can't fire me!


658
01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:12.019
I'll fire you if you don't
go home to your son.


659
01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:18.299
- But I have so much work to do...
- That's an order.


660
01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:23.939
Go home and look after your sick boy
and don't come back until he's well.


661
01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:51.819
The doctor is here.

662
01:44:51.980 --> 01:44:56.059
Doctor?
I haven't called a doctor.


663
01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:00.219
Sture Lindgren sent me.
We're old acquaintances.


664
01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:03.699
- Sture...?
- There's no charge.


665
01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:11.459
Breathe in... and breathe out.

666
01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:13.539
Very good. Breathe in...

667
01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:19.659
Very good.

668
01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:24.659
And lean forward...
Lasse, can you cough for me?


669
01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:30.979
- Good.
- Will he be all right?


670
01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:33.619
It's whooping cough.

671
01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:38.179
There's not much to do
but let nature take its course.


672
01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:42.939
I'll be back in a week
to check on him.


673
01:45:59.420 --> 01:46:01.659
I can't sleep.

674
01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:14.699
I don't think I've ever told you...

675
01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:20.459
...about the town
where everybody drinks soda-


676
01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:22.899
- and says good morning all the time?

677
01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:31.379
It all started when the grown-ups
got angry with the children-


678
01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:35.899
- and sent them away in shame.

679
01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:42.059
And the children went to a new land
to live all on their own.


680
01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:50.059
The children
had to take care of themselves.


681
01:46:52.740 --> 01:46:56.219
But they were just children.

682
01:46:56.420 --> 01:46:58.939
They didn't really know what to do.

683
01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:03.299
So they slept
with their feet on the pillows-


684
01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:06.419
- and wore their clothes inside out-

685
01:47:06.620 --> 01:47:10.659
- and they said good morning
even when it was night time.


686
01:47:17.660 --> 01:47:20.179
Can I sleep in your bed?

687
01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:27.859
Of course, come.

688
01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:51.419
What happened next?

689
01:47:53.620 --> 01:47:56.699
Well, the children...

690
01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:01.419
...they did everything their own way.

691
01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:08.899
And they spent all their time
climbing trees and drinking soda.


692
01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:12.779
They were good at that!

693
01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:55.619
Hi, Astrid. My grandmother
looks after me and my sister.


694
01:48:55.780 --> 01:48:59.779
She says,
"Let the little children come to me. "


695
01:48:59.940 --> 01:49:04.419
She likes to play
even though she's old.


696
01:49:04.620 --> 01:49:07.459
I think you're like that too..

697
01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:12.059
All the children in your books!
I can tell you like us.


698
01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:15.979
You understand us.
You're on the children's side.


699
01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:04.899
You are a good person.

700
01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:51.259
There's my father!

701
01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:03.299
- Welcome.
- Thank you.


702
01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:07.779
- This is Lasse.
- Hello.


703
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:13.779
I'm your grandfather.

704
01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:16.419
She's in the kitchen.

705
01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:44.739
Well... There you are.

706
01:52:48.100 --> 01:52:51.219
Say a proper hello to my mother.

707
01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:54.099
Hello, Lasse.

708
01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:02.499
Welcome.

709
01:53:30.660 --> 01:53:33.179
Tomorrow is Sunday.

710
01:53:34.660 --> 01:53:38.659
I wonder if you'd like
to go to church with us?


711
01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:43.339
If you'd like to.

712
01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:54.579
- Yes, we'll go.
- Thank you.


713
01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:02.499
Is there any coffee?

714
01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:02.099
Hi, Astrid Lindgren.

715
01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:06.859
We also wrote you a song.
It is your birthday!


716
01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:11.619
Our teacher helped us,
but we said what it should be about.


717
01:56:11.780 --> 01:56:15.779
Now we're going to sing it for you,
so you can hear it too.


718
01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:18.819
You write great books.

719
01:56:45.180 --> 01:56:50.299
Take a leap, just
dare to take a leap

720
01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:56.899
Through death into life

721
01:56:57.100 --> 01:57:02.219
Take a leap, just
dare to take a leap

722
01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:07.699
Through the darkness
into the light


723
01:57:09.380 --> 01:57:13.059
Live your life.
Enjoy it


724
01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:18.059
Feel that summertime's
made for you


725
01:57:21.180 --> 01:57:25.699
Live your life
Take a step forward


726
01:57:25.900 --> 01:57:29.939
Or backwards if you like

727
01:57:55.340 --> 01:58:00.579
Live your life.
Be there


728
01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:06.659
Face the storm winds down
with a scream


729
01:58:08.100 --> 01:58:13.419
Take a leap, just
dare to take a leap

730
01:58:13.620 --> 01:58:19.739
Through death into life

731
01:58:19.900 --> 01:58:25.219
Take a leap, just
dare to take a leap

732
01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:31.659
Through the darkness
into the light


733
01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:37.059
Take a leap, just
dare to take a leap

734
01:58:37.180 --> 01:58:42.859
Through death into life
