00:00:13.855 --> 00:00:16.636
<i>They say</i>

2
00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:22.818
<i>in his last life he was a giraffe.</i>

3
00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:29.161
<i>They say</i>

4
00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:34.211
<i>his heart was formed by
the Asakura clan.</i>


5
00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:42.219
<i>They say</i>

6
00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:47.511
<i>the moment he was born</i>

7
00:00:47.688 --> 00:00:55.211
<i>a crack appeared in the sky</i>

8
00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:15.315
SOUL OF A BEAST

9
00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.951
Are you ready?

10
00:03:41.313 --> 00:03:42.499
Head back!

11
00:03:42.523 --> 00:03:44.294
Head back!
Close your eyes!


12
00:03:46.063 --> 00:03:47.549
You're so sweet.

13
00:03:56.813 --> 00:03:58.061
Come here!

14
00:04:27.737 --> 00:04:29.560
It's bedtime.

15
00:04:31.695 --> 00:04:34.139
<i>Ashole!</i>

16
00:04:50.438 --> 00:04:51.636
ZoÃ©!

17
00:04:52.398 --> 00:04:55.032
Just...
Can you take him or not?


18
00:04:57.563 --> 00:05:01.876
Fuck your damn headache!
Take care of him just for once!


19
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.274
Fuck off!

20
00:05:05.313 --> 00:05:06.313
Fuck!

21
00:05:21.148 --> 00:05:23.686
<i>Ashole!</i>

22
00:05:26.898 --> 00:05:29.244
<i>Ashole!</i>

23
00:05:43.648 --> 00:05:47.049
Don't wake him up
just because you're bored.


24
00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:17.338
<i>He just opened the door.</i>

25
00:06:23.563 --> 00:06:24.667
What?

26
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.073
Could you?

27
00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:49.786
Yes?

28
00:06:51.438 --> 00:06:52.588
Joel?

29
00:06:54.648 --> 00:06:57.749
<i>Nothing, the door.
I was sure they'd go,</i>


30
00:06:57.773 --> 00:07:00.936
<i>so I told myself: Let's see
what happens.</i>


31
00:07:00.938 --> 00:07:05.251
<i>I felt very much... Great.
Very smart!</i>


32
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.663
How long have you been
standing there?


33
00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:52.773
Where's Joel?

34
00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:58.299
Will you stay there forever?

35
00:08:04.773 --> 00:08:06.257
Just a minute.

36
00:08:45.188 --> 00:08:47.919
Isn't my father twice
as broad as I?


37
00:08:51.023 --> 00:08:52.938
I totally pushed him
into the ground.


38
00:08:56.605 --> 00:08:58.425
You actually came?

39
00:09:06.773 --> 00:09:08.081
Oh, Madame!

40
00:09:08.105 --> 00:09:10.405
You just tried to kiss
my mother.


41
00:09:12.023 --> 00:09:13.267
Close your eyes!

42
00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:16.611
What's the difference?

43
00:09:16.648 --> 00:09:19.954
Your holy underwear is for my eyes only.
- Oh...


44
00:09:21.523 --> 00:09:22.575
<i>Really?</i>

45
00:09:23.938 --> 00:09:25.568
Turn around!

46
00:09:32.688 --> 00:09:35.805
Are you sure you'll manage?

47
00:09:36.523 --> 00:09:39.164
- Will you manage?
- Yeah... no problem!


48
00:09:39.188 --> 00:09:42.207
Mom! I forgot the
laundry downstairs!


49
00:09:42.605 --> 00:09:44.811
Stop it!
I'm getting dizzy!


50
00:10:28.023 --> 00:10:29.938
Disappear!

51
00:10:39.313 --> 00:10:41.230
Let me try.

52
00:10:52.105 --> 00:10:53.592
Fly!

53
00:11:05.648 --> 00:11:06.999
What's going on?

54
00:11:07.023 --> 00:11:08.986
Come on, I'm ready!

55
00:11:09.605 --> 00:11:10.850
Alright.

56
00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.261
Oh what's coming?

57
00:11:13.523 --> 00:11:14.817
This...

58
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:19.638
is Guatemala.
And it's my farewell party.


59
00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:22.950
And the beginning of...

60
00:11:27.148 --> 00:11:31.173
Mescaline.
That's my girl!


61
00:11:35.355 --> 00:11:37.080
Sorry, I gotta go.

62
00:11:41.438 --> 00:11:44.267
You really have something
better to do now?


63
00:11:46.313 --> 00:11:50.051
Damn right, go home!
What's the matter?


64
00:12:00.355 --> 00:12:01.698
<i>I got him!</i>

65
00:12:18.688 --> 00:12:20.511
You're so stupid!

66
00:13:11.313 --> 00:13:13.374
Shut up!

67
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:18.975
Joel!

68
00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.907
<i>Oh, come here!</i>

69
00:13:38.688 --> 00:13:39.982
Watch and learn.

70
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:43.775
Joel, where are you going?
Damn.


71
00:13:45.773 --> 00:13:48.599
<i>No, he doesn't believe...</i>

72
00:13:50.273 --> 00:13:52.811
Come back!

73
00:13:54.398 --> 00:13:56.123
<i>Come back!</i>

74
00:14:11.148 --> 00:14:13.304
Who are you trying to impress?

75
00:14:13.648 --> 00:14:17.336
- You, baby.
- I just slapped your face.


76
00:14:18.148 --> 00:14:20.207
<i>Are you going to the lions now?</i>

77
00:14:20.438 --> 00:14:22.451
Damn, I need to go
to the penguins.


78
00:14:24.523 --> 00:14:25.767
Penguins.

79
00:14:26.605 --> 00:14:27.850
Damn...

80
00:14:28.063 --> 00:14:30.411
Please stay with me...

81
00:14:34.605 --> 00:14:35.850
Where are you?

82
00:14:35.855 --> 00:14:36.957
Stay here.

83
00:14:45.398 --> 00:14:48.942
Joel's here for the first time.

84
00:14:50.563 --> 00:14:52.432
<i>You aren't.</i>

85
00:14:56.148 --> 00:14:58.399
<i>Everything happens as it's
supposed to.</i>


86
00:15:03.438 --> 00:15:04.924
I can

87
00:15:05.773 --> 00:15:08.024
<i>see inside you.</i>

88
00:15:09.188 --> 00:15:11.873
You're so beautiful.

89
00:15:49.898 --> 00:15:57.898
<i>She came from an unknown planet.</i>

90
00:16:01.855 --> 00:16:09.855
<i>Her body, home to rare gods.</i>

91
00:16:13.898 --> 00:16:19.263
<i>In the color of her eyes...</i>

92
00:16:20.898 --> 00:16:23.292
<i>Gabriel?</i>

93
00:16:24.523 --> 00:16:26.823
<i>Everything alright?</i>

94
00:16:51.273 --> 00:16:52.279
Jamie.

95
00:16:52.688 --> 00:16:54.557
I'm so sorry.

96
00:16:56.523 --> 00:16:58.486
The joker.

97
00:17:01.688 --> 00:17:05.039
<i>Last night, animals escaped
from the municipal zoo.</i>


98
00:17:05.063 --> 00:17:08.124
<i>Among them an Indian peacock,
an Angolan giraffe</i>


99
00:17:08.148 --> 00:17:11.932
<i>and the Colombian puma twins,
Susan and Sheela.</i>


100
00:17:12.188 --> 00:17:14.105
<i>According to first investigations,</i>

101
00:17:14.273 --> 00:17:18.536
<i>the animals managed to escape
through unlocked gates.</i>


102
00:17:18.938 --> 00:17:23.011
<i>Citizens are urged to communicate
any observation.</i>


103
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:28.598
<i>Please be aware:
zoo animals are wild animals.</i>


104
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.869
Jamie?

105
00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:46.618
<i>Where's the microwave?</i>

106
00:18:06.773 --> 00:18:07.779
Hey.

107
00:18:29.023 --> 00:18:30.794
Fresh flesh!

108
00:18:32.563 --> 00:18:34.001
Fresh!

109
00:18:47.063 --> 00:18:49.794
What's up, are you OK?

110
00:18:51.773 --> 00:18:54.407
They're home, you can come up!

111
00:19:10.398 --> 00:19:12.267
Where's your mother?

112
00:19:15.688 --> 00:19:17.318
On vacation.

113
00:19:23.063 --> 00:19:25.331
I thought it would be nice
for Jamie to have a bed.


114
00:19:25.355 --> 00:19:26.554
My sweetheart?

115
00:19:27.563 --> 00:19:29.530
A little bed, just for you?

116
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.536
<i>No?</i>

117
00:19:31.813 --> 00:19:34.113
Where can I place it?

118
00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.542
<i>Where should he put it?</i>

119
00:19:36.563 --> 00:19:40.111
Wherever, in the hallway.
How long will this go on like this?


120
00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.130
Do you need money?

121
00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:45.986
Take it.

122
00:22:21.355 --> 00:22:24.038
They've found no trace
of them yet.


123
00:22:34.105 --> 00:22:35.686
Jamie!

124
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.599
Come here!

125
00:22:47.898 --> 00:22:49.957
Who's this?

126
00:22:51.813 --> 00:22:54.018
My little brother.

127
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.705
Just take them off.

128
00:23:08.813 --> 00:23:11.018
No, it's fine like this.

129
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:22.292
I'm actually going...

130
00:23:32.773 --> 00:23:34.975
There's something in your eye.

131
00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:39.361
Wait.

132
00:23:43.273 --> 00:23:44.998
Oh no, it just dropped.

133
00:24:02.648 --> 00:24:04.707
Your brother's damn cute.

134
00:24:05.813 --> 00:24:08.880
But I don't get why people
still bring kids into this world.


135
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.323
Why?

136
00:24:12.813 --> 00:24:15.930
I don't know. Our world is
just pretty fucked up.


137
00:24:17.398 --> 00:24:20.175
<i>I'd be a horrible mom anyway.</i>

138
00:24:21.063 --> 00:24:24.130
I'd probably forget my
child in a bus.


139
00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.249
Your junior walks in outdoor
shoeson our court


140
00:24:37.273 --> 00:24:39.142
<i>and disrupts our game.</i>

141
00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:42.068
Could you please teach him
some manners?


142
00:24:42.273 --> 00:24:44.044
Thanks.

143
00:25:01.938 --> 00:25:04.430
And? Do you like it?

144
00:25:05.355 --> 00:25:07.129
Where's its head?

145
00:25:08.813 --> 00:25:11.355
There wasn't enough space.

146
00:25:25.148 --> 00:25:28.454
Jamie, don't become a pussy
like your dad!


147
00:25:31.605 --> 00:25:34.386
I really can't remember when
she did that damn giraffe.


148
00:25:34.688 --> 00:25:37.563
As if you could remember
anything.


149
00:25:41.188 --> 00:25:42.818
Just tell me the truth.

150
00:25:42.898 --> 00:25:44.767
Did you fuck her?

151
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:48.792
Wh... What's up?

152
00:25:55.313 --> 00:25:56.561
What an asshole.

153
00:25:56.563 --> 00:25:57.831
Little pussy.

154
00:25:57.855 --> 00:25:59.629
Don't you think she's
really special?


155
00:25:59.648 --> 00:26:00.461
The giraffe?

156
00:26:00.648 --> 00:26:01.648
Your mother!

157
00:26:01.855 --> 00:26:02.861
Corey!

158
00:26:03.855 --> 00:26:05.054
Yeah, she's cool.

159
00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:06.693
She's got bigger issues than I.

160
00:26:06.813 --> 00:26:10.624
Now she runs off to Guatemala,
for a whole year.


161
00:26:10.648 --> 00:26:11.654
Jamie!

162
00:26:11.773 --> 00:26:13.914
Seems like the first time
I'm really in love.


163
00:26:13.938 --> 00:26:15.761
I can't recognize myself.

164
00:26:16.563 --> 00:26:18.001
A whole year?

165
00:26:19.105 --> 00:26:20.207
<i>Exactly!</i>

166
00:27:13.773 --> 00:27:15.354
You could've come with us.

167
00:27:15.648 --> 00:27:17.664
Exactly! I'm sure he has
better things to do


168
00:27:17.688 --> 00:27:19.624
than hanging around with
myannoying cousins.


169
00:27:19.648 --> 00:27:21.164
What's marriage good for?

170
00:27:21.188 --> 00:27:23.874
And why are you wearing
these stupid leather pants?


171
00:27:23.898 --> 00:27:25.813
Because they're hot?

172
00:27:26.188 --> 00:27:27.194
Do it! Bye.

173
00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:29.711
Do you even have a driver's
license for that motor bike?


174
00:27:30.523 --> 00:27:31.863
Of course!

175
00:27:54.188 --> 00:27:55.194
Jamie.

176
00:28:04.688 --> 00:28:06.844
Here you have 50.

177
00:28:07.605 --> 00:28:08.804
Okay?

178
00:28:09.648 --> 00:28:10.956
And here...

179
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.375
His cuddly toy, Leo.

180
00:28:13.855 --> 00:28:15.149
And this, for...

181
00:28:15.313 --> 00:28:18.236
Everything fine, sweetheart,
I can deal with children.


182
00:28:18.398 --> 00:28:20.411
You're going like this?

183
00:28:21.148 --> 00:28:23.399
What's the problem?

184
00:28:30.105 --> 00:28:32.118
Today you're staying
with aunt Afua.


185
00:28:33.105 --> 00:28:34.736
Just for once.

186
00:28:34.855 --> 00:28:36.486
Promised.

187
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:40.263
Fresh!

188
00:28:43.398 --> 00:28:46.273
<i>The puma siblings have been
spotted in the West Wood Forest.</i>


189
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:53.144
<i>Avoid any visit to natural zones,
such as public parks and sports fields.</i>


190
00:28:54.773 --> 00:28:57.024
<i>Stay in controlled areas only.</i>

191
00:28:57.063 --> 00:28:59.461
What's he doing in there?

192
00:29:01.105 --> 00:29:02.686
He lives there.

193
00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:08.979
He thinks it's safest
to lock the door and wait


194
00:29:09.023 --> 00:29:11.036
until the disaster is over.

195
00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.513
What disaster?

196
00:29:14.523 --> 00:29:17.254
Mars is moving backwards,
something like that.


197
00:29:18.355 --> 00:29:21.086
Strange stuff is
supposed to happen.


198
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.907
Shall we go?

199
00:32:27.773 --> 00:32:29.449
Wait!

200
00:32:57.398 --> 00:32:59.698
Come with me to Guatemala.

201
00:33:03.938 --> 00:33:06.480
We'll work on my
father's farm for a bit.


202
00:33:07.148 --> 00:33:10.374
We'll buy a car,
drive through Guatemala,


203
00:33:10.398 --> 00:33:13.289
Bolivia, Tierra del Fuego,
all the way to Patagonia


204
00:33:13.313 --> 00:33:16.380
and we'll ride a whale
to the South Pole.


205
00:33:17.188 --> 00:33:18.482
<i>What do you think?</i>

206
00:33:20.648 --> 00:33:22.373
What about Joel?

207
00:33:28.023 --> 00:33:30.800
Look, everything's going
to pass so damn fast.


208
00:33:31.563 --> 00:33:34.536
I've had this feeling
since I was a kid.


209
00:33:35.648 --> 00:33:37.180
Somehow...

210
00:33:39.063 --> 00:33:44.048
Ever since I saw you,
that feeling has increased...


211
00:33:47.355 --> 00:33:49.368
That there's no time...

212
00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.329
That I have to do everything...

213
00:33:54.023 --> 00:33:55.604
Now.

214
00:34:27.648 --> 00:34:32.392
We'll do it all with horses!
My father has beautiful horses!


215
00:34:51.313 --> 00:34:55.626
<i>Together.</i>

216
00:34:57.898 --> 00:35:02.498
<i>They'd set cities on fire.</i>

217
00:35:07.313 --> 00:35:11.530
<i>Together...</i>

218
00:35:28.273 --> 00:35:33.111
<i>The first victim of the puma sibling
died a few hours after the attack.</i>


219
00:35:34.438 --> 00:35:40.286
<i>The nightly curfew will take effect
between 10 pm and 6 am.</i>


220
00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:43.499
<i>Torn power lines from a television
antenna and traces of blood</i>


221
00:35:43.523 --> 00:35:46.914
<i>from the giraffe indicate
that it must have injured itself.</i>


222
00:35:46.938 --> 00:35:49.331
If they've grown up in concrete

223
00:35:49.355 --> 00:35:51.992
they're going to die in concrete.

224
00:35:52.398 --> 00:35:55.664
<i>Otherwise, still no more
traces of the giraffe.</i>


225
00:35:55.688 --> 00:35:58.948
<i>Its disappearance remains
a mystery to all of us.</i>


226
00:35:59.563 --> 00:36:01.001
<i>Somalia -</i>

227
00:36:01.438 --> 00:36:03.692
<i>I'm in love.</i>

228
00:36:05.063 --> 00:36:06.644
So...?

229
00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:12.669
She... She doesn't know
about Jamie.


230
00:36:13.063 --> 00:36:14.598
Why?

231
00:36:21.688 --> 00:36:23.798
What am I supposed to do?

232
00:36:24.523 --> 00:36:27.732
Do you think I'm the best person

233
00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.074
to give you advice
on life choices?


234
00:36:47.148 --> 00:36:49.448
We had the same.

235
00:36:51.023 --> 00:36:53.417
We all have the same.

236
00:36:57.563 --> 00:36:59.530
<i>It's the best.</i>

237
00:37:09.398 --> 00:37:10.930
Mom?

238
00:37:12.438 --> 00:37:15.026
Could you pick up
the phone some time?


239
00:37:15.938 --> 00:37:17.617
Everything's fine.

240
00:37:17.688 --> 00:37:21.523
It would just be nice to get
some news from you...


241
00:37:38.898 --> 00:37:40.525
<i>1, 2, 3...</i>

242
00:37:41.023 --> 00:37:42.507
<i>1, 2, 3...</i>

243
00:37:58.813 --> 00:38:01.355
Come on, Jamie, you can do this.

244
00:38:01.523 --> 00:38:03.679
We'll just say hi.

245
00:38:22.563 --> 00:38:24.768
Gabriel, come here!

246
00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.823
Hi Jamie!

247
00:38:27.023 --> 00:38:28.938
How are you?

248
00:41:05.605 --> 00:41:06.755
Come.

249
00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:08.736
Jamie.

250
00:41:09.313 --> 00:41:10.319
Let's go!

251
00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.725
<i>Excuse me, Miss.</i>

252
00:41:41.023 --> 00:41:42.555
Gabriel's here.

253
00:41:49.523 --> 00:41:51.342
What are you doing here?

254
00:41:52.398 --> 00:41:55.032
Your mom's dancing
with 2 flowerpots.


255
00:41:55.898 --> 00:41:57.767
Didn't wanna miss that.

256
00:41:57.938 --> 00:42:00.238
Why aren't you out there?

257
00:42:01.188 --> 00:42:04.017
I'm dizzy and I've got
a headache.


258
00:42:06.188 --> 00:42:08.586
<i>Don't you think the
floor's slanted?</i>


259
00:42:09.313 --> 00:42:11.518
<i>It's not horizontal, is it?</i>

260
00:42:13.188 --> 00:42:15.201
Do you see that?

261
00:42:22.898 --> 00:42:25.388
Maybe you wanna first
say hi to Jamie?


262
00:42:28.605 --> 00:42:30.186
Jamie!

263
00:42:30.688 --> 00:42:32.030
Jamie!

264
00:42:32.563 --> 00:42:34.576
Come to mommy!

265
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:38.236
Jamie!

266
00:42:38.438 --> 00:42:40.451
Come to mommy!

267
00:42:42.063 --> 00:42:43.980
I've missed you very much.

268
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.061
You see?

269
00:42:51.188 --> 00:42:55.311
What did you imagine, that
he'd jump at you jubilantly?


270
00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:10.136
Are you really sure that
the floor isn't slanted?


271
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:13.861
What am I doing here?

272
00:43:13.938 --> 00:43:17.388
I came to see if you're better.
And if...


273
00:43:17.605 --> 00:43:19.954
Fuck it.
Jamie, we're leaving.


274
00:43:20.023 --> 00:43:22.369
Wait, I'm really dizzy.

275
00:43:22.398 --> 00:43:24.600
Really dizzy.

276
00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.993
Maybe you've got cancer.

277
00:43:31.313 --> 00:43:33.469
Do you think I have cancer?

278
00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.068
Why do you say
something like this?


279
00:43:46.313 --> 00:43:47.607
ZoÃ©.

280
00:43:50.188 --> 00:43:52.393
Jamie needs you.

281
00:44:01.648 --> 00:44:03.804
Sorry, I see it's not a
good moment.


282
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:05.763
You could've called,
but it's nice to see you.


283
00:44:05.773 --> 00:44:06.299
Come on!

284
00:44:06.563 --> 00:44:07.426
Let's go dance.

285
00:44:07.438 --> 00:44:09.211
I have to puke.

286
00:44:09.938 --> 00:44:10.944
ZoÃ©.

287
00:44:11.773 --> 00:44:13.305
Come on!

288
00:44:15.023 --> 00:44:17.179
Come on, let's go dance!

289
00:44:17.563 --> 00:44:18.811
Come on, let's dance!

290
00:44:22.523 --> 00:44:23.961
Wait.

291
00:44:42.105 --> 00:44:43.925
Just please wait.

292
00:44:45.938 --> 00:44:47.186
OK?

293
00:45:11.605 --> 00:45:12.994
Mom!

294
00:45:24.523 --> 00:45:28.039
<i>We were in the desert
without reception.</i>


295
00:45:28.063 --> 00:45:30.124
<i>Now we've arrived in Essaouira.</i>

296
00:45:30.688 --> 00:45:33.132
<i>It's gorgeous!</i>

297
00:45:33.648 --> 00:45:36.811
<i>I could stay here forever.</i>

298
00:45:37.398 --> 00:45:39.649
<i>Don't forget the rent!</i>

299
00:45:40.898 --> 00:45:43.149
<i>Whatever forever...</i>

300
00:46:47.273 --> 00:46:48.469
She's cool.

301
00:46:49.313 --> 00:46:51.136
Yeah, she is.

302
00:46:59.105 --> 00:47:02.219
Right now she's in happy mode.

303
00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:05.274
<i>Fuck.</i>

304
00:47:27.938 --> 00:47:30.143
He seems tired.

305
00:47:30.563 --> 00:47:33.392
He rubs his ear like you do.

306
00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:39.724
<i>Are you coming, Jamie?</i>

307
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:45.092
<i>Are you coming with me?
I'll take a little nap.</i>


308
00:48:13.563 --> 00:48:16.918
<i>Thoughts...</i>

309
00:48:18.355 --> 00:48:21.757
<i>make the clouds shift.</i>

310
00:48:21.773 --> 00:48:23.161
Stop!

311
00:48:29.563 --> 00:48:32.680
<i>Clouds...</i>

312
00:48:33.355 --> 00:48:36.038
<i>cover the sun.</i>

313
00:48:36.188 --> 00:48:37.194
Stop!

314
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:44.693
<i>You killed me.</i>

315
00:48:50.105 --> 00:48:55.232
<i>I will kill you.</i>

316
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.480
Stop!

317
00:49:37.148 --> 00:49:38.392
Boo!

318
00:49:41.063 --> 00:49:43.651
Am I allowed to talk now?

319
00:49:49.813 --> 00:49:52.067
I need to tell...

320
00:50:23.648 --> 00:50:25.275
Hey.

321
00:50:28.813 --> 00:50:30.636
Hey, Joel.

322
00:50:30.773 --> 00:50:32.929
Still wearing the same pants?

323
00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.869
Exactly.

324
00:50:52.105 --> 00:50:54.836
Sweating all day in
the same pants.


325
00:51:23.773 --> 00:51:24.773
Joel.

326
00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:30.730
Oops.

327
00:51:36.063 --> 00:51:37.932
Surprise.

328
00:51:39.688 --> 00:51:41.798
I bought a ticket.

329
00:51:44.438 --> 00:51:47.169
I was really looking
forward to it.


330
00:51:50.438 --> 00:51:51.999
But you know what?

331
00:51:52.023 --> 00:51:56.525
Maybe you can use it
to wipe his son's ass.


332
00:52:05.563 --> 00:52:06.618
Joel!

333
00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:08.369
Wait!

334
00:52:22.273 --> 00:52:24.717
Ashole

335
00:52:28.023 --> 00:52:30.417
Ashole

336
00:53:12.355 --> 00:53:14.511
I couldn't sleep.

337
00:53:17.648 --> 00:53:20.092
<i>Please get off the street!</i>

338
00:53:21.148 --> 00:53:23.111
<i>I ask you to get off the street!</i>

339
00:53:24.105 --> 00:53:26.549
<i>You are inside the curfew!</i>

340
00:53:50.188 --> 00:53:51.769
You're bleeding.

341
00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.082
It's nothing.

342
00:53:54.313 --> 00:53:55.655
Should I get you a band-aid?

343
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:18.243
ZoÃ©, what do you want?

344
00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:23.375
I have to think about
Jamie all the time.


345
00:54:26.688 --> 00:54:29.851
And about us.

346
00:54:45.063 --> 00:54:47.699
You can see Jamie tomorrow.

347
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:56.867
They won't let me out anymore.

348
00:55:01.688 --> 00:55:03.461
You know where he sleeps.

349
00:56:04.773 --> 00:56:09.611
<i>The moment you die...</i>

350
00:56:18.023 --> 00:56:23.198
<i>a crack appears in the sky.</i>

351
00:56:55.523 --> 00:56:57.055
What are you doing?

352
00:56:57.773 --> 00:56:58.825
Let me...

353
00:56:58.855 --> 00:57:00.005
Please let me.

354
00:57:00.188 --> 00:57:02.344
Get off!

355
00:57:03.563 --> 00:57:04.761
Gabriel, please.

356
00:57:08.688 --> 00:57:10.030
Leave!

357
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:12.380
You want it too!

358
00:57:12.398 --> 00:57:13.956
Don't touch me.
I know you want it.


359
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.418
You want it too!
Fuck off, damn it!


360
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.493
I'm trapped here!

361
00:57:17.688 --> 00:57:19.956
Because you fuck up everything!

362
00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:21.130
Stop touching me!

363
00:57:21.355 --> 00:57:22.411
Stop touching me!

364
00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:23.150
Stop it!

365
00:57:23.273 --> 00:57:24.086
You're a mistake!

366
00:57:24.148 --> 00:57:25.874
Don't say this! Please...

367
00:57:25.898 --> 00:57:28.706
All this because you can't
change his fucking diapers!


368
00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:30.168
Bitch!
- Stop it!


369
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:31.619
Piss off!

370
00:57:31.813 --> 00:57:32.813
Leave!

371
00:57:33.273 --> 00:57:35.956
Piss off and cure yourself!

372
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:37.611
Piss off!

373
00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:51.480
ZoÃ©.

374
00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:53.263
Since we mean shit to you,

375
00:57:53.438 --> 00:57:55.307
we'll jump!

376
00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:57.725
So you're gonna be free!

377
00:57:57.898 --> 00:57:59.812
ZoÃ©, he's afraid.
You're saying


378
00:57:59.813 --> 00:58:01.394
it's all my fault?

379
00:58:02.023 --> 00:58:03.029
Let him go.

380
00:58:03.313 --> 00:58:08.011
If you hadn't left,
we'd be a family.


381
00:58:25.023 --> 00:58:26.938
Piss off!

382
00:58:27.273 --> 00:58:28.325
Piss off!

383
00:58:29.938 --> 00:58:32.048
And never come back again!

384
00:58:39.938 --> 00:58:40.993
Open the door!

385
00:58:41.398 --> 00:58:42.786
Open the door!

386
00:58:47.563 --> 00:58:49.193
Open the door!

387
00:58:49.523 --> 00:58:50.817
Jamie!

388
00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:52.630
Open!

389
00:58:52.898 --> 00:58:54.206
Please open the door!

390
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:56.039
<i>You are inside the curfew!</i>

391
00:58:56.063 --> 00:58:57.788
They're taking my baby!

392
00:58:57.938 --> 00:58:59.519
<i>1, 2, 3...</i>

393
00:58:59.523 --> 00:59:01.582
They're taking my baby!

394
00:59:03.813 --> 00:59:04.868
It's gone!

395
00:59:06.938 --> 00:59:08.042
No!

396
00:59:13.023 --> 00:59:14.461
No!

397
00:59:17.438 --> 00:59:18.636
Jamie!

398
00:59:22.773 --> 00:59:24.257
Jamie!

399
00:59:27.438 --> 00:59:31.124
<i>Susan, one of the puma twins,

400
00:59:31.148 --> 00:59:33.736
<i>Security forces were
forced to kill it.</i>


401
00:59:34.105 --> 00:59:37.624
<i>Last night's paint attack

402

<i>unleashed various protest
movements in several districts.</i>

<i>Increasing riots are to be expected

<i>We are...</i>

405
00:59:47.605 --> 00:59:50.386
<i>We are approaching
a state of emergency.</i>

409
01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.563
<i>Oh!</i>

410
01:00:01.688 --> 01:00:04.036
You can't take that car!

411
01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:07.049
Leave that fucking car here!

412
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:10.729
Why can't you leave
everything as it is?


413
01:00:17.438 --> 01:00:19.307
Fuck you!

414
01:00:56.938 --> 01:00:58.136
I love you.

415
01:02:01.063 --> 01:02:02.063
Yo!

416
01:02:08.438 --> 01:02:10.594
It's too late to talk.

417
01:02:24.563 --> 01:02:26.817
<i>Go find your daddy first.</i>

418
01:02:28.398 --> 01:02:31.942
You'll probably find out
why you're a traitor.


419
01:02:34.648 --> 01:02:37.236
Little pussy.

420
01:03:13.105 --> 01:03:14.111
This is for me!

421
01:03:15.688 --> 01:03:17.318
For me!

422
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:20.482
She belongs to me.

423
01:03:22.023 --> 01:03:23.029
To me!

424
01:03:23.313 --> 01:03:24.417
Do you get it?

425
01:03:24.438 --> 01:03:25.636
For me! For me!

426
01:03:26.313 --> 01:03:28.374
Are you listening?
For me!


427
01:03:29.898 --> 01:03:32.054
God damn it!

428
01:03:51.688 --> 01:03:53.605
Yo, Gabe!

429
01:05:16.773 --> 01:05:18.067
Corey!

430
01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.073
Wait!

431
01:05:22.605 --> 01:05:25.624
You can't leave! If you leave now,
everything's over!


432
01:05:26.898 --> 01:05:29.486
Shouldn't you take care
of your little brother?


433
01:05:33.313 --> 01:05:35.581
Are you ashamed or what?

434
01:05:35.605 --> 01:05:36.605
No!

435
01:05:36.898 --> 01:05:38.789
I would've never left him alone,
you know that!


436
01:05:38.813 --> 01:05:40.831
You have a child, and now what?

437
01:05:40.855 --> 01:05:43.586
Millions have kids, that's why
we're all here, right?


438
01:05:55.523 --> 01:05:57.007
Oh!

439
01:05:57.648 --> 01:06:00.042
And what do you know
about my life?


440
01:06:01.355 --> 01:06:03.175
You just do whatever you want!

441
01:06:03.523 --> 01:06:06.300
Lucky you!
Have a beautiful life!


442
01:06:06.938 --> 01:06:09.430
But you're ruining everything!

443
01:06:09.898 --> 01:06:11.813
You're ruining everything.

444
01:06:12.855 --> 01:06:14.629
What do you want from me?

445
01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:20.736
What?

446
01:06:21.605 --> 01:06:23.186
Man... I'm...

447
01:06:23.273 --> 01:06:25.332
I cannot help that...

448
01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:29.167
That you crossed my life,
that you exist.


449
01:06:29.605 --> 01:06:30.948
But that's me.

450
01:06:31.313 --> 01:06:32.417
I'm like this.

451
01:06:33.398 --> 01:06:35.457
I destroy everything...

452
01:06:39.148 --> 01:06:40.392
Yeah, it's...

453
01:06:40.398 --> 01:06:43.789
It's crap, but it's like
in those Indian movies


454
01:06:43.813 --> 01:06:46.539
where the main actor tears out
a piece of his heart and


455
01:06:46.563 --> 01:06:50.414
your name's written on it.
And men are always so ugly


456
01:06:50.438 --> 01:06:52.374
and women so damn beautiful...

457
01:06:52.398 --> 01:06:56.567
Anyway, all this only happens on
TV and in Titanic bullshit but...


458
01:06:56.605 --> 01:06:58.330
without you...

459
01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:01.944
It's all empty.

460
01:07:09.313 --> 01:07:11.613
We'll see each other again.

461
01:07:12.648 --> 01:07:14.850
I'm sure of it.

462
01:07:21.313 --> 01:07:23.326
Take care.

463
01:08:18.105 --> 01:08:23.042

472
01:09:54.438 --> 01:09:55.588
Come!

473
01:11:12.605 --> 01:11:15.624
Is there a constellation
of the giraffe?


474
01:11:17.688 --> 01:11:19.413
Hmm...

475
01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:26.380
There...
I can see it.


476
01:11:31.438 --> 01:11:35.032
It's right next to
the big bear...

482
01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:21.236

Where is he?

01:20:40.688 --> 01:20:46.294
<i>The landlord called.
Didn't you pay the rent?</i>


505
01:20:49.938 --> 01:20:52.718
<i>I actually wanted
to stay longer.</i>


506
01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:59.738
<i>But it's such a mess at home.</i>

507
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:06.025
<i>He was a fool.</i>

508
01:21:11.648 --> 01:21:12.749
<i>Yeah...</i>

509
01:21:14.648 --> 01:21:16.563
<i>Whatever.</i>

510
01:21:18.730 --> 01:21:23.713
<i>Just a fool in love.</i>

511
01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:07.232
Ashole

512
01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:19.442
Come on, why else are you here?

513
01:23:07.273 --> 01:23:09.188
Where is he?

514
01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.444
Madame.

515
01:23:42.563 --> 01:23:46.349
If you had just once listened
to your daughter,


516
01:23:53.273 --> 01:23:57.057
this damned world
wouldn't be falling apart.


517
01:24:02.313 --> 01:24:06.194
If you leave now, you'll never
see your son again.


518
01:24:07.688 --> 01:24:09.511
<i>Never.</i>

519
01:24:35.898 --> 01:24:38.292
Jamie belongs to me.

520
01:24:40.773 --> 01:24:42.688
Forever.

521
01:25:16.898 --> 01:25:21.832
<i>A man with a hole in his heart</i>

522
01:25:23.414 --> 01:25:26.190
<i>will never be the same again.</i>

523
01:25:31.148 --> 01:25:35.377
<i>He has chosen the path</i>

524
01:25:36.398 --> 01:25:42.260
<i>between heaven and hell.</i>

525
01:27:30.730 --> 01:27:33.557
<i>Target southwest.
Unit 3, advance.</i>


526
01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:39.986
<i>Respond!</i>

527
01:27:40.563 --> 01:27:41.713
<i>OK.</i>

528
01:29:01.773 --> 01:29:03.257
<i>Take care.</i>

529
01:30:25.563 --> 01:30:27.624
<i>Gabriel?</i>

530
01:31:01.938 --> 01:31:03.855
Do you want to listen?

531
01:31:04.313 --> 01:31:07.573
We always danced to this.

532
01:31:24.523 --> 01:31:26.248
One for my daughter.

533
01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:40.424
One for the earth.

534
01:31:47.273 --> 01:31:49.573
She hasn't left yet.

535
01:32:04.523 --> 01:32:06.536
I know, son.

536
01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:12.079
I know, my son.

537
01:32:27.105 --> 01:32:28.448
Jamie!

538
01:32:41.273 --> 01:32:47.167
<i>His soul had not come along.</i>

539
01:32:51.438 --> 01:32:57.524
<i>He had to stay in this place.</i>

540
01:32:58.563 --> 01:33:02.542
<i>Until his body</i>

541
01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:08.107
<i>was reunited with his soul.</i>

542
01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:43.829
You stay here.

543
01:34:21.148 --> 01:34:23.448
Shush...

544
01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:47.725
It's me.

545
01:38:40.313 --> 01:38:45.919
<i>In the color of your eyes,</i>

546
01:38:48.313 --> 01:38:53.011
<i>my ancestry.</i>

547
01:39:02.688 --> 01:39:09.830
<i>Nothing lasts.</i>

548
01:39:12.188 --> 01:39:17.411
<i>I will love you.</i>

549
01:39:19.813 --> 01:39:22.844
<i>More than anything...</i>
