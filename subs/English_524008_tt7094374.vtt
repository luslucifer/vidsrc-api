1
00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:33.822
Hmm.

2
00:01:36.427 --> 00:01:38.393
I never really thought
I'd come back here.


3
00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:04.219
- Oh, my goodness!
- Yeah.


4
00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:05.754
You're here.

5
00:02:11.562 --> 00:02:14.263
You look like a werewolf
with that beard.


6
00:02:14.265 --> 00:02:15.597
- Yeah.
- God didn't give you


7
00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.432
your father's good looks
so you could hide


8
00:02:17.434 --> 00:02:18.767
under all that hair.

9
00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.636
It's good to see you, too, Mother.

10
00:02:20.638 --> 00:02:23.438
Don't be too loud.
Your father is already asleep.


11
00:02:24.108 --> 00:02:25.974
You're as beautiful as ever.

12
00:02:29.146 --> 00:02:31.046
You travel light.

13
00:02:31.048 --> 00:02:33.949
We put most of our stuff
in storage in Oakland.


14
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:36.918
Oh, you should just get
everything shipped here.


15
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.620
Those places are expensive.

16
00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.429
Uh, I'm sorry
about the mess.


17
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:51.366
I've been having a little trouble
getting up and down the stairs, lately.


18
00:02:51.368 --> 00:02:54.503
But, the entire
second floor is yours.


19
00:02:54.505 --> 00:02:56.938
And I even set up
a coffee machine on the bureau.


20
00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.709
Mom, we're here to help you,
not give you more work.


21
00:03:00.711 --> 00:03:03.845
Well,
the bed is ready now.


22
00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.082
How is Michael?

23
00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:09.017
Oh, he's much better.

24
00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.654
And he's so excited
to have Mike back home.


25
00:03:13.924 --> 00:03:16.291
Yeah, he's so excited,
he can't even sleep.


26
00:03:18.028 --> 00:03:20.662
It was a wedding gift
from my in laws.


27
00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:23.565
Yes, very, um...

28
00:03:25.636 --> 00:03:28.236
Sweetheart, if you ever
need anything else to wear,


29
00:03:28.238 --> 00:03:30.138
you just take a look
in these closets.


30
00:03:50.961 --> 00:03:51.927
Right, Mike?

31
00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:54.062
I'm sorry, about what?

32
00:03:54.064 --> 00:03:55.564
The keys to the practice.

33
00:03:55.566 --> 00:03:57.466
Rebecca will be there
at 9:00 tomorrow.


34
00:03:57.468 --> 00:03:58.734
Oh, good.

35
00:04:01.672 --> 00:04:03.739
I am so glad you're home.

36
00:04:15.853 --> 00:04:20.889
I'm getting the feeling that your mom
thinks we're moving in permanently.


37
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:23.759
Yeah, I had this conversation
with her ten times.


38
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:25.727
She just hears what she wants.

39
00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:29.398
Well, at least
your father is doing better.


40
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.999
That's some good news, right?

41
00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:34.936
Uh-huh. Mmm-hmm.

42
00:04:36.306 --> 00:04:37.506
Hey.

43
00:04:41.578 --> 00:04:42.811
Thanks for doing this.

44
00:04:43.947 --> 00:04:44.980
Of course.

45
00:04:47.418 --> 00:04:48.650
Come here.

46
00:04:52.456 --> 00:04:55.257
So, my mom try
and sell you on the bed?


47
00:04:56.393 --> 00:04:58.827
It's so creepy.

48
00:05:00.631 --> 00:05:04.132
It's, um,
no, it's perfect for a werewolf.


49
00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:06.501
Huh?

50
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:16.978
Oh, sorry.

51
00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:06.228
Welcome home, buddy.

52
00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:20.842
Let's see what we got.

53
00:06:25.382 --> 00:06:26.882
Thank you, Rebecca.

54
00:06:27.618 --> 00:06:30.085
Okay. Now, open up for me.

55
00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:34.155
Okay, how many fingers
do you see?


56
00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:37.359
Two.

57
00:06:38.061 --> 00:06:39.160
Good girl.

58
00:06:41.365 --> 00:06:42.931
Mom, I can see you.

59
00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:02.918
I see the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

60
00:07:08.392 --> 00:07:12.627
This is Dr. Ericson's number. You
should schedule an appointment with him.


61
00:07:14.464 --> 00:07:15.897
Are you leaving us again?

62
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.199
I'm only here for the summer.

63
00:07:18.201 --> 00:07:20.335
I'm just taking over from my father
till we can sell the practice.


64
00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:23.972
I'm really sorry, Mike.

65
00:07:26.693 --> 00:07:29.411
We're gonna miss him. 
He's just such a great doctor.

66
00:07:30.414 --> 00:07:31.680
A really good guy.

67
00:07:32.783 --> 00:07:34.549
You must be really proud of him.

68
00:07:34.551 --> 00:07:36.818
- Hmm?
- Your father.


69
00:07:37.688 --> 00:07:38.820
You have his hands.

70
00:07:42.726 --> 00:07:44.593
Roman's lenses came in.

71
00:07:44.595 --> 00:07:46.294
Oh, thank you.

72
00:07:47.631 --> 00:07:49.164
- Have a good evening.
- You too.


73
00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:01.176
<i>Hey, honey. Hey.</i>

74
00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:05.580
<i>Listen, I have
a last minute surgery.</i>


75
00:08:05.582 --> 00:08:08.383
<i>Yeah, I won't be home
until about 9:00.</i>


76
00:08:09.553 --> 00:08:10.819
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

77
00:08:11.555 --> 00:08:12.787
<i>Okay.</i>

78
00:08:13.457 --> 00:08:14.723
<i>I love you.</i>

79
00:08:33.377 --> 00:08:34.476
That bad, huh?

80
00:08:35.379 --> 00:08:37.012
I'm sorry, Mike.

81
00:08:37.014 --> 00:08:40.048
I'm afraid the results
of the MRI are conclusive.


82
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.854
No. Come on.

83
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:51.559
The sounds you hear,
your trembling hands...


84
00:08:51.561 --> 00:08:55.130
You have the same mutation
as your father.


85
00:08:55.132 --> 00:08:57.432
It seems you're
developing it earlier.


86
00:09:04.007 --> 00:09:06.041
How long until
I become like him?


87
00:09:08.545 --> 00:09:10.345
It's hard to say.

88
00:09:12.616 --> 00:09:15.450
But meeting here
won't be enough to hide it.


89
00:09:16.586 --> 00:09:19.054
Your symptoms will
be evident soon.


90
00:09:20.057 --> 00:09:22.190
Disorientation, memory loss.

91
00:09:22.826 --> 00:09:24.526
Visual hallucinations.

92
00:09:25.896 --> 00:09:28.096
You won't be able
to take care of yourself.


93
00:09:30.033 --> 00:09:32.534
There's-there's...
There's gotta be something we can do.


94
00:09:37.441 --> 00:09:40.075
Just... go home.

95
00:09:41.411 --> 00:09:42.944
And tell your family.

96
00:09:44.047 --> 00:09:46.014
You don't need
to go through this alone.


97
00:10:06.603 --> 00:10:07.902
Good evening, Father.

98
00:10:12.309 --> 00:10:14.309
Remember little Tania?

99
00:10:15.712 --> 00:10:17.178
Her surgery

100
00:10:18.482 --> 00:10:19.814
went great.

101
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.116
Mom, I'm gonna need your help!

102
00:10:55.886 --> 00:10:57.318
Come on, big boy.

103
00:11:05.862 --> 00:11:06.895
Get away from me!

104
00:11:08.565 --> 00:11:09.964
Stop, stop, stop!

105
00:11:09.966 --> 00:11:11.800
What are you doing?

106
00:11:11.802 --> 00:11:12.834
Ma! Ma!

107
00:11:12.836 --> 00:11:14.302
Get away! Get away!

108
00:11:15.338 --> 00:11:16.437
Mike...

109
00:11:18.775 --> 00:11:20.175
what are you doing here?

110
00:11:21.244 --> 00:11:22.177
Huh?

111
00:11:23.079 --> 00:11:24.078
Huh?

112
00:11:25.715 --> 00:11:26.948
Huh?

113
00:11:32.255 --> 00:11:33.188
What?

114
00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:36.991
Huh.

115
00:11:55.579 --> 00:11:57.078
It still sounds good.

116
00:11:58.582 --> 00:12:00.949
My mom used to play this
all the time when I was a kid.


117
00:12:00.951 --> 00:12:04.319
Yeah, I got it tuned this morning and I
was thinking of teaching piano lessons


118
00:12:04.321 --> 00:12:07.355
to a few of the neighbors
if your parents don't mind.


119
00:12:07.357 --> 00:12:09.490
Well, I guess it all depends
if they're in earshot.


120
00:12:09.492 --> 00:12:10.925
Jerk.

121
00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:17.498
This is for you.

122
00:12:18.902 --> 00:12:20.301
What's the occasion?

123
00:12:21.438 --> 00:12:24.038
Do I need a reason
to tell you how much I love you?


124
00:12:27.878 --> 00:12:29.177
Lovely.

125
00:12:31.014 --> 00:12:32.680
- Will you help me put it on?
- Yeah.


126
00:12:53.837 --> 00:12:55.503
I'd like to keep my throat, too.

127
00:12:55.739 --> 00:12:57.438
Sorry.

128
00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:00.842
You know, for someone who spends
all day with a scalpel in his hand,


129
00:13:00.844 --> 00:13:02.510
you're pretty clumsy
with this stuff.


130
00:13:02.512 --> 00:13:05.146
Got a good hand on your
bra clasp though, didn't I?


131
00:13:06.116 --> 00:13:07.649
Um, eventually.

132
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.988
Oh, it's so pretty.

133
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.692
Let's celebrate. I got a nice
bottle of Bordeaux from Jeffrey's.


134
00:13:31.975 --> 00:13:33.341
Are you okay?

135
00:13:34.644 --> 00:13:36.110
Why don't you sit down?

136
00:13:36.112 --> 00:13:37.378
You look exhausted.

137
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.417
What? No. Look, I can clean it.
Just give me the paper towels.


138
00:13:42.419 --> 00:13:45.620
You have to do it fast,
before it absorbs into the carpet.


139
00:13:50.427 --> 00:13:52.427
I am not a child!
I can do it myself!


140
00:13:52.429 --> 00:13:53.561
You're hurting me.

141
00:13:57.167 --> 00:13:58.433
Babe, I'm so sorry.

142
00:14:00.437 --> 00:14:03.037
I don't even know, uh...

143
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:06.040
I'm sorry.

144
00:15:02.332 --> 00:15:03.798
<i>They love you.</i>

145
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.566
You didn't see her face.

146
00:15:07.137 --> 00:15:08.669
She was afraid of me.

147
00:15:11.708 --> 00:15:13.241
I can't do this to her.

148
00:15:14.911 --> 00:15:17.011
I want to do it before...

149
00:15:17.013 --> 00:15:19.280
before it's too late
for me to decide.


150
00:15:19.282 --> 00:15:20.948
You will break her heart.

151
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.350
No. No.

152
00:15:23.586 --> 00:15:26.220
She won't find out.
I'll make it look like an accident.


153
00:15:26.222 --> 00:15:29.891
It's never an accident, Mike.
People always find out.


154
00:15:31.594 --> 00:15:32.727
How would you know?

155
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.130
I found out about my daughter.

156
00:15:37.834 --> 00:15:39.834
She was in pain, too.

157
00:15:39.836 --> 00:15:43.871
Everyone thought I was a heartless woman
for trying to end my daughter's suffering.


158
00:15:44.974 --> 00:15:47.141
They found her
on the train tracks.


159
00:15:50.647 --> 00:15:51.712
I'm sorry.

160
00:15:53.616 --> 00:15:57.251
Your case won't meet the
requirements for the California law.


161
00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.420
You need to be terminal.

162
00:16:06.563 --> 00:16:10.465
There is a place
in downtown Los Angeles,


163
00:16:11.601 --> 00:16:13.468
run by a friend of mine.

164
00:16:15.071 --> 00:16:16.604
Her name is Vilma.

165
00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.876
All of her clients are dealing
with similar feelings.


166
00:16:21.878 --> 00:16:26.948
I think that you should talk to people
who are going through the same thing.


167
00:16:28.051 --> 00:16:29.350
Group therapy.

168
00:16:30.687 --> 00:16:33.855
Sometimes the kindness
of strangers is the best cure.


169
00:17:12.328 --> 00:17:14.562
What the fuck are
you looking at, buddy?


170
00:17:16.032 --> 00:17:19.333
Oh, Mike, you scared me.

171
00:17:24.741 --> 00:17:26.674
I never understood
what you saw in him.


172
00:17:27.343 --> 00:17:28.576
What are you talking about?

173
00:17:28.578 --> 00:17:30.011
We don't have
to pretend anymore.


174
00:17:31.714 --> 00:17:33.681
I know everything
between you and my father.


175
00:17:53.436 --> 00:17:55.002
What if he gets better?

176
00:17:55.004 --> 00:17:57.805
Why can't any of you accept
he's not coming back, Rebecca!


177
00:17:58.474 --> 00:18:00.408
He's gone! He's losing his mind!

178
00:18:03.246 --> 00:18:04.779
There's nothing
we can do about it.


179
00:18:06.683 --> 00:18:07.782
There's no cure.

180
00:18:10.653 --> 00:18:11.719
There is no cure.

181
00:19:17.787 --> 00:19:20.755
- I think I...
- We were waiting for you, Mike.


182
00:19:21.391 --> 00:19:22.723
I am Piedad.

183
00:19:23.693 --> 00:19:26.460
Three months already,
they started the session.


184
00:19:38.141 --> 00:19:42.510
We need you to sign a non-disclosure
agreement before you can join the group.


185
00:19:43.479 --> 00:19:45.146
We're very discreet.

186
00:19:55.525 --> 00:19:57.391
It'll make you free in there.

187
00:20:08.638 --> 00:20:10.738
You can take it off
when you're ready.


188
00:20:14.444 --> 00:20:15.810
<i>Brandon.</i>

189
00:20:16.612 --> 00:20:18.446
I finally
told my daughter.


190
00:20:19.749 --> 00:20:22.750
We went to see
the game last week.


191
00:20:23.653 --> 00:20:25.453
And I had another seizure

192
00:20:25.455 --> 00:20:28.956
and I remember looking
at her face at one point,


193
00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:32.326
and thinking,
I know this is my daughter,


194
00:20:32.328 --> 00:20:33.894
but I can't say her name.

195
00:20:39.235 --> 00:20:40.835
I think she understands.

196
00:20:43.239 --> 00:20:45.539
Or not. Who knows?

197
00:20:49.746 --> 00:20:52.613
At least I know I've had
my chance to say goodbye.


198
00:21:02.792 --> 00:21:05.025
Brandon, we are
going to miss you.


199
00:21:17.473 --> 00:21:19.473
You are finally ready.

200
00:21:26.516 --> 00:21:28.716
We have a new guest tonight.

201
00:21:29.886 --> 00:21:31.285
Welcome, Mike.

202
00:21:32.488 --> 00:21:33.888
What brings you here?

203
00:21:36.025 --> 00:21:40.261
I can feel myself getting
sicker with every day that goes by.


204
00:21:40.263 --> 00:21:43.531
I just don't want to rot
in that house with my father


205
00:21:43.533 --> 00:21:47.501
for... who knows how long.

206
00:21:49.405 --> 00:21:51.505
I can't
-I can't end up like him.

207
00:21:53.342 --> 00:21:54.942
I won't let him do that to me.

208
00:21:58.981 --> 00:22:00.247
And my wife...

209
00:22:01.584 --> 00:22:03.951
she doesn't deserve this burden.

210
00:22:03.953 --> 00:22:06.754
She doesn't deserve to suffer
the way my mother has.


211
00:22:08.658 --> 00:22:12.393
Mike, you're not going
to end up like your father.


212
00:22:12.395 --> 00:22:14.829
Because

213
00:22:14.831 --> 00:22:17.131
you two are completely
different people.


214
00:22:17.133 --> 00:22:19.366
I really wish someone
would have told him that,


215
00:22:19.368 --> 00:22:23.204
like a long time ago,
because I didn't want to be a doctor.


216
00:22:24.941 --> 00:22:27.074
I didn't want to work
at his practice.


217
00:22:29.145 --> 00:22:33.814
I didn't want to put my life on pause,
so I could pick up the pieces of his.


218
00:22:38.287 --> 00:22:39.553
And here I am.

219
00:22:43.626 --> 00:22:46.660
You did all those things
because you wanted to.


220
00:22:47.964 --> 00:22:51.131
I don't think you're taking
responsibility for your life.


221
00:22:52.902 --> 00:22:54.068
And until you do,

222
00:22:55.104 --> 00:22:56.237
you are not ready.

223
00:23:02.345 --> 00:23:03.310
Mike.

224
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.283
I think I can help you.

225
00:23:11.087 --> 00:23:12.119
Follow me.

226
00:23:28.371 --> 00:23:31.539
The cover of<i>Vanitae,</i> June '96.

227
00:23:31.541 --> 00:23:34.775
You probably remember it.
I was everywhere.


228
00:23:36.145 --> 00:23:37.378
Wow, you were pretty.

229
00:23:38.714 --> 00:23:42.249
I mean, ahem, you still are.

230
00:23:42.585 --> 00:23:44.485
You're sweet.

231
00:23:44.487 --> 00:23:46.820
A horrible liar, but sweet.

232
00:23:48.724 --> 00:23:51.392
No, keep it. That's how
I want to be remembered.


233
00:23:54.697 --> 00:23:57.498
So,
you said you could help me.


234
00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.866
After the<i>Vanitae</i> photo shoot,

235
00:23:58.868 --> 00:24:00.968
I went back to Spain
for a while.


236
00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:04.638
I was the muse of all
the major designers in Europe,


237
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.307
but when I came back
to the U.S.,


238
00:24:06.309 --> 00:24:07.808
they told me I was too old.

239
00:24:08.911 --> 00:24:11.478
A movie producer came to me
and offered me a role,


240
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.781
if I could get rid
of some wrinkles.


241
00:24:14.784 --> 00:24:16.050
Movie never happened.

242
00:24:16.686 --> 00:24:18.385
But I married that bastard.

243
00:24:19.922 --> 00:24:23.724
He kept asking me to lose
weight, to touch up my face,


244
00:24:25.328 --> 00:24:29.763
and one surgery lead
to the next, until one day,


245
00:24:29.765 --> 00:24:33.400
I couldn't recognize the person who
was staring back at me in the mirror.


246
00:24:34.637 --> 00:24:35.970
And he divorced me.

247
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.307
I tried to kill myself
a few times.


248
00:24:40.309 --> 00:24:42.710
But I didn't have the guts
to finish the job.


249
00:24:44.547 --> 00:24:46.213
Vilma told me I was...

250
00:24:46.215 --> 00:24:48.248
I was crying
for the bastard's attention.


251
00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:49.883
Maybe.

252
00:24:49.885 --> 00:24:52.987
Maybe I was. But not anymore.

253
00:24:53.756 --> 00:24:55.189
I want to die with dignity.

254
00:24:58.394 --> 00:25:00.794
That's when I joined the Chain.

255
00:25:02.531 --> 00:25:04.665
Uh, the Chain?

256
00:25:04.667 --> 00:25:09.236
A group of people that operate under
the radar to assist each other...


257
00:25:10.106 --> 00:25:11.038
with death.

258
00:25:12.308 --> 00:25:13.841
They are helping me die.

259
00:25:14.844 --> 00:25:16.410
We can help you too, Mike.

260
00:25:18.748 --> 00:25:21.081
I'm not sure I follow.

261
00:25:21.751 --> 00:25:23.851
You've been thinking about it.

262
00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.719
Suicide.

263
00:25:26.422 --> 00:25:28.889
But you have concerns.

264
00:25:28.891 --> 00:25:32.593
"Would I be strong enough?
Will I do it properly?


265
00:25:32.595 --> 00:25:35.496
How would it affect
my loved ones?"


266
00:25:37.366 --> 00:25:41.735
In the Chain, we provide
assistance with all of that.


267
00:25:41.737 --> 00:25:45.205
Everybody dies
on their own terms.


268
00:25:45.207 --> 00:25:48.142
But before you get help,
you have to help someone else.


269
00:25:49.445 --> 00:25:50.778
That's... That's...

270
00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.579
That's not suicide.
That's murder.


271
00:25:52.581 --> 00:25:53.847
No.

272
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.784
No. Not if it's consensual.

273
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.319
Nor if it's the only way out.

274
00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:05.392
The person assigned to me, my
link, can be reassigned to you,


275
00:26:05.394 --> 00:26:07.094
if you're willing to assist me.

276
00:26:11.067 --> 00:26:14.034
Are you
asking me to kill you?


277
00:26:14.036 --> 00:26:16.203
I'm asking you to help me.

278
00:26:18.708 --> 00:26:20.307
Uh...

279
00:26:20.309 --> 00:26:23.143
Look, I, I appreciate
you reaching out.


280
00:26:23.813 --> 00:26:26.346
But uh... I'm...

281
00:26:26.348 --> 00:26:28.716
I'm not your guy. No.

282
00:26:28.718 --> 00:26:30.317
Think about it, Mike.

283
00:26:30.886 --> 00:26:32.352
Think about it.

284
00:26:32.354 --> 00:26:34.138
If you came to Vilma,

285
00:26:34.139 --> 00:26:35.923
that means that there's
only one way out for you, too.


286
00:27:03.819 --> 00:27:05.819
Where have you been?

287
00:27:05.821 --> 00:27:07.554
We called you a million times.

288
00:27:07.556 --> 00:27:08.889
Mom, what happened?

289
00:27:08.891 --> 00:27:10.591
I just fell in the kitchen.

290
00:27:12.728 --> 00:27:14.027
You bastard.

291
00:27:15.064 --> 00:27:17.164
No, no, it was just an accident.

292
00:27:17.166 --> 00:27:19.967
Mom, we need to take you to a hospital.
You need stitches.


293
00:27:19.969 --> 00:27:21.769
All right, Rebecca,
you're gonna stay here with my father


294
00:27:21.771 --> 00:27:22.770
till my wife gets home, okay?

295
00:27:22.772 --> 00:27:25.539
No! You stay with your father.

296
00:27:25.541 --> 00:27:27.474
Rebecca can take me.
Right, dear?


297
00:27:27.476 --> 00:27:28.909
Oh. Of course.

298
00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:50.230
Hey.

299
00:27:52.868 --> 00:27:54.301
How the hell
did you walk in here?


300
00:27:56.272 --> 00:27:57.337
I'm getting better.

301
00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.341
I'll be back
at the practice in no time.


302
00:28:04.613 --> 00:28:08.615
Dr. Ryan said uh...

303
00:28:08.617 --> 00:28:13.387
Well, I never would have seen you
again, unless I was really sick.


304
00:28:14.223 --> 00:28:15.255
Right?

305
00:28:16.592 --> 00:28:18.058
Are you making all this shit up?

306
00:28:24.433 --> 00:28:26.700
Well, you can be sure that if you
can't take care of the practice


307
00:28:26.702 --> 00:28:29.369
by yourself, I'm selling it.

308
00:28:29.371 --> 00:28:31.138
When Mom finds out about this,

309
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.140
she's going to agree to send you
to a fucking nursing home.


310
00:28:33.142 --> 00:28:35.609
Ha-ha. You always
did have my temper.


311
00:28:35.611 --> 00:28:36.810
I am nothing like you!

312
00:28:36.812 --> 00:28:40.547
Oh, we both know
that's not true, my son.


313
00:28:42.952 --> 00:28:46.119
I still have good friends
at the hospital.


314
00:28:49.658 --> 00:28:52.459
Have you told your wife, huh?

315
00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.629
I thought so.

316
00:28:59.101 --> 00:29:00.701
Why did you abandon us?

317
00:29:01.971 --> 00:29:04.071
- You know why.
- Huh.


318
00:29:06.775 --> 00:29:09.476
Son, I've always
been fond of you, Mike.


319
00:29:11.814 --> 00:29:13.580
Even though on the outside I...

320
00:29:15.217 --> 00:29:18.185
I didn't act toward you like

321
00:29:18.187 --> 00:29:20.487
other fathers act
toward their children.


322
00:29:22.057 --> 00:29:24.992
But that's because
I can't pretend,


323
00:29:25.794 --> 00:29:27.461
like other people can.

324
00:29:32.534 --> 00:29:33.901
Careful, careful, careful.

325
00:29:33.903 --> 00:29:35.836
You'll screw up the disposal.

326
00:29:35.838 --> 00:29:38.038
And who's gonna
have to fix it, huh!


327
00:29:54.723 --> 00:29:55.656
Ah, I've got it.

328
00:30:00.296 --> 00:30:01.828
I got it.

329
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.330
I got it.

330
00:30:05.167 --> 00:30:07.167
It'll be our little secret.

331
00:30:08.404 --> 00:30:09.436
You keep mine.

332
00:30:10.873 --> 00:30:12.139
I'll keep yours.

333
00:30:20.082 --> 00:30:22.516
You just relax.
Two cc's of procaine.


334
00:30:33.963 --> 00:30:36.330
I can put the forceps away
for you, Doctor.


335
00:30:41.337 --> 00:30:44.204
You can't differentiate
a scalpel from a forceps?


336
00:30:46.408 --> 00:30:49.276
What a shame.
You're an embarrassment.


337
00:30:49.278 --> 00:30:51.078
You know that.

338
00:31:21.343 --> 00:31:24.177
I'm sorry, but they have grounds
for a claim, Mike.


339
00:31:25.614 --> 00:31:27.881
The insurance company said
there will be an investigation,


340
00:31:27.883 --> 00:31:30.984
and you will probably
lose your license.


341
00:31:33.622 --> 00:31:34.654
Okay, look...

342
00:31:36.692 --> 00:31:39.159
Don't say anything to my
parents, Emma, I'll handle it.


343
00:31:39.161 --> 00:31:42.896
Rebecca, my name is Rebecca.

344
00:31:42.898 --> 00:31:44.631
Right. Sorry.

345
00:31:46.001 --> 00:31:48.402
What the hell is going on
with you, Mike?


346
00:31:48.404 --> 00:31:51.538
What is it? Are you on drugs?

347
00:31:56.879 --> 00:31:58.311
Great.

348
00:31:59.114 --> 00:32:01.515
You have managed
to ruin everything


349
00:32:01.517 --> 00:32:03.950
your father worked
so hard to build.


350
00:32:20.469 --> 00:32:22.702
<i>I can't keep
going like this anymore.</i>


351
00:32:24.373 --> 00:32:28.475
After my last surgery,
my skin got infected.


352
00:32:28.477 --> 00:32:31.178
Doctor says there's nothing
he can do about it.


353
00:32:31.947 --> 00:32:33.713
Antibiotics don't work anymore.

354
00:32:33.715 --> 00:32:37.451
I'm sure that you can overcome
this difficult moment, Piedad.


355
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.653
You're a strong woman.

356
00:32:39.655 --> 00:32:43.256
But let's talk about why
you did this new surgery.


357
00:32:43.258 --> 00:32:45.358
And who you're
really doing it for.


358
00:32:50.432 --> 00:32:53.733
Look at me, Vilma,
you have to believe me.


359
00:32:54.636 --> 00:32:57.370
I'm not doing this
for my ex-husband anymore.


360
00:32:57.973 --> 00:32:59.673
I'm doing this for myself.

361
00:33:01.643 --> 00:33:04.744
The anniversary of the photoshoot
is coming in two weeks.


362
00:33:05.447 --> 00:33:06.379
And I would love
to pass that day.


363
00:33:10.252 --> 00:33:13.553
I understand how you feel,
my dear Piedad.


364
00:33:14.423 --> 00:33:17.991
But we've been here
before many times.


365
00:33:17.993 --> 00:33:20.994
This is not about
your physical appearance.


366
00:33:20.996 --> 00:33:22.395
Bullshit!

367
00:33:23.432 --> 00:33:25.966
I came to you before Brandon.

368
00:33:25.968 --> 00:33:28.101
And I was here before Linda.

369
00:33:28.103 --> 00:33:30.036
David, Samantha.

370
00:33:30.038 --> 00:33:32.239
I've been patient! I've waited!

371
00:33:32.774 --> 00:33:34.341
It is my turn now.

372
00:33:34.343 --> 00:33:37.043
- I deserve your help.
- Enough!


373
00:33:37.045 --> 00:33:39.246
You are not ready. Sit down!

374
00:33:54.296 --> 00:33:55.562
Piedad.

375
00:33:56.031 --> 00:33:57.364
Piedad, wait.

376
00:33:57.799 --> 00:33:58.832
Hey.

377
00:34:03.438 --> 00:34:05.739
I think, I think we can
help each other.


378
00:34:09.845 --> 00:34:11.645
If I do this...

379
00:34:11.647 --> 00:34:14.981
- Yes.
- ...there can't be any suspicion of foul play.


380
00:34:14.983 --> 00:34:18.652
It's the only way to avoid any
unnecessary pain for my wife or my mother.


381
00:34:20.122 --> 00:34:22.856
Like I said,
your life, your rules.


382
00:34:22.858 --> 00:34:24.958
That's how the Chain works.

383
00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.762
You and your assignee
can figure all the details out.


384
00:34:30.132 --> 00:34:33.133
Here's the contact information
you'll need.


385
00:34:33.135 --> 00:34:34.768
No, no, no.
I don't want this information.


386
00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:36.636
There can be absolutely
no trace of communication.


387
00:34:36.638 --> 00:34:38.572
We have to be
extremely discreet.


388
00:34:39.775 --> 00:34:41.741
I'm being investigated
for malpractice,


389
00:34:41.743 --> 00:34:45.478
and I can't jeopardize my wife and my
mom cashing in on my life insurance.


390
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.414
How's your link going
to find you then?


391
00:34:47.416 --> 00:34:52.419
It's easy. I'm at my father's practice every
day alone after six. Here's the address.


392
00:34:54.223 --> 00:34:55.789
It's my life, my rules, right.

393
00:34:56.725 --> 00:34:58.758
Fine.

394
00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.830
Just give me a week. Tell them to give
me a week after I help you, because


395
00:35:03.832 --> 00:35:06.666
I'm gonna need to take care
of some business before I...


396
00:35:07.202 --> 00:35:08.969
I do this.

397
00:35:08.971 --> 00:35:11.004
I'm gonna write you an obituary.

398
00:35:11.006 --> 00:35:14.941
There's this app that we all use at
the hospital called "Obitsearch."


399
00:35:14.943 --> 00:35:19.079
Okay? Just tell my link to
download it and check it daily.


400
00:35:21.283 --> 00:35:22.716
An obituary?

401
00:35:23.885 --> 00:35:25.885
It has to be my motto.

402
00:35:25.887 --> 00:35:28.321
Well, it can be anything.
What do you want it to write?


403
00:35:32.928 --> 00:35:33.994
Got it.

404
00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:38.898
A wise girl kisses
but doesn't love.


405
00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.167
Listens, but doesn't believe.

406
00:35:41.169 --> 00:35:43.103
And she leaves
before she's left.


407
00:35:47.009 --> 00:35:48.008
Suits you.

408
00:35:48.877 --> 00:35:50.410
Credit Marilyn for it.

409
00:35:51.747 --> 00:35:55.849
So, are you ready
to go over my plan?


410
00:35:57.152 --> 00:35:58.385
Yeah.

411
00:35:58.387 --> 00:36:02.822
So, this is the main entrance
to the elevator.


412
00:36:03.625 --> 00:36:06.359
I'll leave the key of room 1011

413
00:36:06.862 --> 00:36:08.395
inside the big pot,

414
00:36:08.397 --> 00:36:09.896
on the left side of the lobby.

415
00:36:11.433 --> 00:36:12.966
I'll be waiting for you

416
00:36:13.835 --> 00:36:15.935
in suite 1010.

417
00:36:15.937 --> 00:36:17.570
Both of them are connected.

418
00:36:21.009 --> 00:36:22.075
Very good.

419
00:36:27.215 --> 00:36:30.717
Tommy, this one measure
here, needs a little more forte.


420
00:36:31.653 --> 00:36:35.221
But, you're gonna impress
Anna at the recital.


421
00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.127
Bye. Say hi to your mom.

422
00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:47.834
- You okay?
- Yeah.


423
00:36:49.604 --> 00:36:50.970
I was just thinking...

424
00:36:53.575 --> 00:36:55.542
you're gonna be
a really great mom one day.


425
00:36:57.346 --> 00:36:59.012
Are you sure
that's all you were thinking?


426
00:37:03.552 --> 00:37:05.118
Maybe there's something else.

427
00:37:11.293 --> 00:37:12.859
- Yes?
- Uh...


428
00:37:16.298 --> 00:37:17.697
Uh...

429
00:37:23.872 --> 00:37:26.072
I don't think
Tommy's really gonna


430
00:37:26.074 --> 00:37:27.974
impress anybody at the recital.

431
00:37:30.846 --> 00:37:33.580
You're a horrible,
terrible person.


432
00:37:33.582 --> 00:37:35.782
He kind of sounds like
a cat got set on fire


433
00:37:35.784 --> 00:37:38.551
and let loose inside
of that thing.


434
00:37:38.553 --> 00:37:41.654
Well, some people are
just born with two left hands.


435
00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:42.589
Hmm.

436
00:37:43.325 --> 00:37:44.457
Not you, though.

437
00:38:34.843 --> 00:38:37.944
They saw her
getting out of your car.


438
00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:40.713
Will you calm down, Emma?

439
00:38:43.919 --> 00:38:46.886
Why do you have to humiliate me
in front of everyone?


440
00:38:49.825 --> 00:38:51.558
I don't know
what you're talking about.


441
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.127
But I'd watch your tone
if I were you.


442
00:38:54.763 --> 00:38:56.129
Oh, you would, would you?

443
00:38:57.466 --> 00:38:58.698
Bastard.

444
00:39:00.035 --> 00:39:01.801
I am sick of this.

445
00:39:01.803 --> 00:39:04.737
One of these days,
you're gonna come home,


446
00:39:04.739 --> 00:39:07.307
and Mike and I will be gone.

447
00:39:10.846 --> 00:39:12.979
- You okay, Mom?
- Mmm-hmm.


448
00:39:12.981 --> 00:39:16.316
I was laughing so hard
with Claire, I popped a stitch.


449
00:39:16.318 --> 00:39:19.118
I'm gonna go out for a little
while with some friends.


450
00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.086
I'll be back later.

451
00:39:20.088 --> 00:39:21.621
Okay. Have fun.

452
00:40:12.474 --> 00:40:14.040
So sorry.
Let me get that for you.


453
00:40:14.042 --> 00:40:15.074
No, no, no, no.

454
00:40:15.911 --> 00:40:18.077
- Thank you.
- Are you okay, sir?


455
00:40:32.594 --> 00:40:33.993
- Hello.
- Hi.


456
00:40:35.864 --> 00:40:37.463
Would you mind pressing ten for
me, please?


457
00:40:37.465 --> 00:40:39.198
Of course. Be my pleasure.

458
00:41:17.872 --> 00:41:20.440
Still here. Still here.

459
00:41:23.979 --> 00:41:26.813
I am adding this
to my time capsule.


460
00:41:27.582 --> 00:41:29.749
Someone will find it one day.

461
00:41:29.751 --> 00:41:33.086
And everybody will know
who that bastard really was.


462
00:41:34.189 --> 00:41:36.155
I thought you were doing this
for you and not for him.


463
00:41:44.733 --> 00:41:46.432
Show me what you got.

464
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:51.004
It's called Digitoxin.

465
00:41:52.374 --> 00:41:55.341
If you take half the bottle,
it'll give you a heart attack.


466
00:41:55.343 --> 00:41:57.577
Uh, it's painless.

467
00:41:57.579 --> 00:42:00.546
If you could take it in smaller
doses over a period of time,


468
00:42:00.548 --> 00:42:04.083
it's untraceable, but I guess,
we're not too concerned with that.


469
00:42:05.053 --> 00:42:07.820
Um, it was actually
the murder weapon


470
00:42:07.822 --> 00:42:10.490
in Agatha Christie's
<i>Appointment with Death</i>


471
00:42:11.459 --> 00:42:13.593
and in an episode of<i>Columbo.</i>

472
00:42:13.595 --> 00:42:14.594
Uh-huh.

473
00:42:14.596 --> 00:42:17.397
So, it's glamorous,

474
00:42:17.399 --> 00:42:18.564
but not too cliche.

475
00:42:18.566 --> 00:42:20.466
- Mmm-hmm.
- Just...


476
00:42:20.468 --> 00:42:21.801
Just what you asked for.

477
00:42:29.344 --> 00:42:30.943
- Is this your...
- Maybe.


478
00:42:34.182 --> 00:42:35.148
Aspirin.

479
00:42:40.488 --> 00:42:41.921
You gotta be kidding me.

480
00:42:43.058 --> 00:42:44.390
God damn it!

481
00:42:45.193 --> 00:42:47.060
Calm down. Calm down.

482
00:42:47.062 --> 00:42:48.828
Calm down.

483
00:42:50.398 --> 00:42:52.398
Let's follow my original plan.

484
00:42:55.537 --> 00:42:56.969
It will be...

485
00:43:00.408 --> 00:43:01.874
It's going to be unforgettable.

486
00:43:08.383 --> 00:43:09.449
You look terrific.

487
00:43:11.152 --> 00:43:12.218
Sweet liar.

488
00:43:23.264 --> 00:43:24.330
It's all right. I'm here.

489
00:43:28.369 --> 00:43:29.535
Will you kiss me?

490
00:43:45.687 --> 00:43:46.886
Thank you.

491
00:44:01.035 --> 00:44:02.969
I don't want
to do this anymore, Mike.


492
00:44:02.971 --> 00:44:04.604
No, no, no!
What do you mean?


493
00:44:04.606 --> 00:44:06.506
I want to go to the hospital.

494
00:44:06.508 --> 00:44:08.141
Please, help me.

495
00:44:09.611 --> 00:44:11.511
I don't want to die, Mike.

496
00:44:11.513 --> 00:44:13.513
Help me! Help me!

497
00:44:40.408 --> 00:44:42.675
Is everything ight in there?

498
00:44:42.677 --> 00:44:44.277
- Ma'am?
- Piedad.


499
00:44:45.746 --> 00:44:47.212
Someone from
the lobby is on their way.


500
00:44:47.215 --> 00:44:51.551
Shit! Piedad, look,
if we don't dress these wounds,


501
00:44:51.553 --> 00:44:53.486
you're not going to make it
to the hospital, okay?


502
00:44:55.623 --> 00:44:58.224
- Quiet, are you crazy?
- Somebody is in there.


503
00:44:58.226 --> 00:45:00.626
- Call the police.
- This was your idea. This was what you wanted.


504
00:45:00.628 --> 00:45:02.895
What happened to keeping
your dignity and all that shit!


505
00:45:02.897 --> 00:45:05.064
Wait! No, no, no, no.

506
00:45:05.066 --> 00:45:07.900
No, no, no, no, girl.
Whoa. No, wake up.


507
00:45:07.902 --> 00:45:09.969
Wake up.

508
00:45:09.971 --> 00:45:12.238
This is the concierge,
ma'am, we're coming.


509
00:47:28.009 --> 00:47:29.842
<i>A "B" in Biology.</i>

510
00:47:29.844 --> 00:47:31.544
Now you know the deal.

511
00:47:31.546 --> 00:47:34.347
But, but Dad, Coach Harris said
I have a real chance of going


512
00:47:34.349 --> 00:47:35.948
to college
on a football scholarship.


513
00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.183
Football?

514
00:47:38.186 --> 00:47:40.653
My son isn't going
to be a football player.


515
00:47:41.589 --> 00:47:43.255
You're too small.

516
00:47:43.257 --> 00:47:46.025
But, but Coach Harris said
I'm in great shape.


517
00:47:46.027 --> 00:47:47.626
I run fast and my lungs are big.

518
00:47:47.628 --> 00:47:50.629
Oh, you think you have
powerful lungs, huh?


519
00:48:10.952 --> 00:48:12.218
Mom?

520
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:30.736
You know, if you can smoke,
you can change your pants yourself.


521
00:48:31.973 --> 00:48:35.341
I have worked hard
all of my life.


522
00:48:37.011 --> 00:48:39.311
And sacrificed
everything for you.


523
00:48:39.313 --> 00:48:42.648
And you have never had any
cause for worries of any kind.


524
00:48:44.252 --> 00:48:47.787
And yet, I have not asked
for gratitude for this.


525
00:48:49.991 --> 00:48:52.825
Just some sort of obligingness.

526
00:48:52.827 --> 00:48:54.794
Just some small shred
of sympathy


527
00:48:55.129 --> 00:48:56.729
for the old man.

528
00:48:57.732 --> 00:49:00.766
But you've been walking away
from me all your life.


529
00:49:03.504 --> 00:49:04.637
And now this.

530
00:49:07.041 --> 00:49:09.175
Rebecca told me what you did.

531
00:49:14.749 --> 00:49:17.583
I never wanted to work
at your damn practice.


532
00:49:17.585 --> 00:49:19.485
You never would have
made it, Mike.


533
00:49:20.321 --> 00:49:21.854
You weren't good enough.

534
00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:24.190
And you know it.

535
00:49:25.693 --> 00:49:28.094
The closest you would
ever come to the NFL


536
00:49:28.096 --> 00:49:30.296
is being a waiter
in a sports bar.


537
00:49:31.799 --> 00:49:34.333
You should be grateful
that I sent you to med school.


538
00:49:35.103 --> 00:49:36.535
You should be grateful.

539
00:50:13.474 --> 00:50:14.540
Dr. Coleman.

540
00:50:15.176 --> 00:50:17.543
- Hi.
- Yeah.


541
00:50:17.545 --> 00:50:21.180
Detective Darcy from the LAPD.
Do you have a moment?


542
00:50:21.182 --> 00:50:23.649
I hope this is a good time.
Your mother said it was all right.


543
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:27.286
Yeah, sure.

544
00:50:27.288 --> 00:50:29.788
I wanted to speak to you
about Miss Piedad Lopez.


545
00:50:31.959 --> 00:50:33.225
Uh, who?

546
00:50:33.694 --> 00:50:34.793
Piedad Lopez.

547
00:50:36.931 --> 00:50:41.100
I understand you two attended the
same therapy group in downtown L.A.


548
00:50:41.102 --> 00:50:45.671
And it seems also that you were with her at
the Shattered Glass bar a couple of times,


549
00:50:45.673 --> 00:50:46.772
according to a waitress.

550
00:50:48.109 --> 00:50:52.411
Um, right, sorry, the uh...

551
00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:54.813
Yeah, the girl from therapy.

552
00:50:54.815 --> 00:50:59.084
Uh, sorry, I've only seen her
a couple of times, so I just...


553
00:50:59.086 --> 00:51:01.587
I don't remember her name. Um...

554
00:51:02.623 --> 00:51:06.559
Uh, would you mind
if we talk in the office?


555
00:51:07.528 --> 00:51:10.729
My wife, she doesn't know
I go to therapy.


556
00:51:11.799 --> 00:51:12.865
After you.

557
00:51:27.281 --> 00:51:28.981
You okay, Dr. Coleman?

558
00:51:28.983 --> 00:51:30.549
Yes. Yes.

559
00:51:31.452 --> 00:51:33.385
Well, Miss Lopez was
found dead yesterday.


560
00:51:33.387 --> 00:51:37.389
I'm just checking with everyone who might
have any relevant information about her.


561
00:51:37.391 --> 00:51:41.927
Well, I, I, I really wouldn't know
why she would try to kill herself.


562
00:51:43.831 --> 00:51:45.497
I didn't say it was suicide.

563
00:51:47.468 --> 00:51:50.002
So, wait. What, what was it?

564
00:51:50.004 --> 00:51:52.171
There were some signs
of struggle.


565
00:51:52.173 --> 00:51:55.674
There was also two different
sets of footprints in the room.


566
00:51:55.676 --> 00:51:57.743
Forensics is doing
DNA tests now.


567
00:51:58.946 --> 00:52:00.045
This was murder.

568
00:52:02.683 --> 00:52:05.517
Uh, well, I only met
Piedad twice.


569
00:52:05.519 --> 00:52:07.853
You know,
so I didn't really know her.


570
00:52:07.855 --> 00:52:10.456
Mike, are you here?

571
00:52:11.492 --> 00:52:13.826
Hey, baby, I'm right here.

572
00:52:13.828 --> 00:52:15.027
What are you doing?

573
00:52:15.029 --> 00:52:16.662
I'm just finishing up
some emails.


574
00:52:16.664 --> 00:52:18.597
Hey, why don't you hop on
upstairs and start breakfast,


575
00:52:18.599 --> 00:52:20.132
and I'll just be up in a sec.

576
00:52:20.134 --> 00:52:22.835
Okay, well, come on,
'cause Tommy's mom is dropping him in 20.


577
00:52:22.837 --> 00:52:23.902
Okay.

578
00:52:29.777 --> 00:52:33.045
Listen, Detective, I really wish
I could be of more help but...


579
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:36.915
Call me
if you remember anything.


580
00:52:37.718 --> 00:52:38.751
Bye.

581
00:52:44.725 --> 00:52:46.592
- Have a good day, Dr. Coleman.
- Mmm-hmm.


582
00:52:54.902 --> 00:52:56.402
Oh, Tommy, you're early.

583
00:52:56.404 --> 00:52:58.570
- Good morning, Mike.
- Good morning. Come in.


584
00:53:00.074 --> 00:53:02.508
I need to do some errands
and I was hoping you could


585
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:04.009
spend a little more time
with Tommy.


586
00:53:04.011 --> 00:53:05.377
Of course, Linda.

587
00:53:25.366 --> 00:53:27.066
There you go. There you go.

588
00:53:28.903 --> 00:53:30.469
Yeah.

589
00:53:30.471 --> 00:53:32.705
Only a week left till recital.

590
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.920
Oh, my God.

591
00:55:29.223 --> 00:55:30.622
Your mom was right.

592
00:55:31.258 --> 00:55:32.758
You do take after your dad.

593
00:55:34.562 --> 00:55:36.361
That's creepy.

594
00:55:36.363 --> 00:55:37.629
Sorry.

595
00:55:39.366 --> 00:55:40.599
Uh...

596
00:55:41.402 --> 00:55:42.701
Actually, there's uh...

597
00:55:44.104 --> 00:55:47.039
- There's something I want to talk about.
- Finally!


598
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:51.009
You've been acting so weird
since we got here. What is it,


599
00:55:51.011 --> 00:55:52.644
- Mike Coleman?
- Uh.


600
00:55:55.382 --> 00:55:56.682
Um...

601
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:06.625
It's uh, just a precaution,
you know, just...


602
00:56:08.796 --> 00:56:10.562
In case anything happens to me.

603
00:56:12.299 --> 00:56:13.265
Life insurance.

604
00:56:15.002 --> 00:56:16.735
I mean, you know,
it will be enough


605
00:56:16.737 --> 00:56:19.738
to keep you comfortable,
and uh...


606
00:56:20.841 --> 00:56:21.874
You know.

607
00:56:22.943 --> 00:56:26.078
I just try
and plan ahead in my life.


608
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.114
Be an adult. You know,
don't adults do this?


609
00:56:31.185 --> 00:56:33.852
- Are you sick?
- No.


610
00:56:35.055 --> 00:56:35.988
No, not at all.

611
00:56:38.492 --> 00:56:41.126
Then I'm going to pretend
that this isn't awkward.


612
00:56:44.064 --> 00:56:45.063
Babe,

613
00:56:46.567 --> 00:56:48.100
my dad didn't plan ahead.

614
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:50.168
Okay? And now,

615
00:56:51.405 --> 00:56:53.605
you see this mess
that we're dealing with.


616
00:56:56.477 --> 00:56:57.676
Okay.

617
00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:03.115
Babe, I know it's been
really hard on you...


618
00:57:04.652 --> 00:57:06.285
seeing your parents like this.

619
00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:13.225
But we're gonna be fine, okay?

620
00:57:13.227 --> 00:57:15.094
We're gonna...

621
00:57:15.095 --> 00:57:16.962
At the end of the summer,
we're driving back to San Francisco,


622
00:57:16.964 --> 00:57:20.365
and we're gonna get a new house
and we're gonna start a new life.


623
00:57:24.038 --> 00:57:25.771
More like,

624
00:57:25.773 --> 00:57:28.907
we'll drink wine every night
and make love every day.


625
00:57:29.577 --> 00:57:31.610
Yeah.

626
00:57:31.612 --> 00:57:34.413
Except you're not going
to be pouring the glasses.

627
00:57:38.552 --> 00:57:39.918
And we're gonna have two kids.

628
00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:44.189
And they're gonna be
really happy kids.


629
00:57:44.191 --> 00:57:45.390
Yeah?

630
00:57:45.392 --> 00:57:47.326
Yeah. Two really happy kids.

631
00:57:48.929 --> 00:57:50.996
And do you know why
they're gonna be so happy?


632
00:57:53.867 --> 00:57:59.304
Because we're not going to make the same
mistakes that our parents made with us.


633
00:57:59.306 --> 00:58:01.974
And we'll support them with whatever
they want to do with their lives.


634
00:58:01.976 --> 00:58:02.975
Yeah.

635
00:58:04.244 --> 00:58:07.012
And we're gonna accept them
exactly as they are.


636
00:58:10.818 --> 00:58:13.251
And then will be the time
to talk about this.


637
00:58:13.253 --> 00:58:15.120
- Yeah.
- But, um...


638
00:58:15.122 --> 00:58:16.455
not until then, okay?

639
00:58:16.457 --> 00:58:18.991
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?


640
00:58:22.029 --> 00:58:22.961
- Yeah.
- Okay.


641
00:58:33.807 --> 00:58:37.976
I've already paid for the first
three months, okay. It's really nice.


642
00:58:37.978 --> 00:58:39.778
They'll take
really good care of you.


643
00:58:42.149 --> 00:58:45.617
They have a huge garden
with a wooden gazebo


644
00:58:45.619 --> 00:58:48.086
and they have a library,

645
00:58:48.088 --> 00:58:50.956
so you can read the paper.
A TV room with a big fireplace.


646
00:58:50.958 --> 00:58:52.424
And Mom can visit you everyday.

647
00:58:53.027 --> 00:58:54.526
Good try.

648
00:58:54.528 --> 00:58:56.028
Now let me be clear.

649
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:58.430
I am not leaving this house.

650
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:05.237
And if you don't want your mother
and Sarah to know our little secret,


651
00:59:06.507 --> 00:59:08.106
you'll just stay away from this.

652
00:59:08.676 --> 00:59:09.908
Father.

653
00:59:11.879 --> 00:59:13.412
When Sarah
and I leave in a few weeks,


654
00:59:13.414 --> 00:59:15.514
Mom's not going to be able
to take care of you by herself.


655
00:59:15.516 --> 00:59:17.783
Stop, stop, stop.

656
00:59:17.785 --> 00:59:20.218
Son, we're both
in the same boat here.


657
00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:22.821
You can't go anywhere
with your condition.


658
00:59:25.225 --> 00:59:27.192
Yeah, well, I'm gonna be
gone sooner than you think.


659
00:59:27.194 --> 00:59:29.795
But I'm not leaving you here
with Mom again. You hear me!


660
00:59:42.676 --> 00:59:44.309
I know that you love me.

661
00:59:45.979 --> 00:59:49.915
In your own sick
and twisted way.


662
00:59:50.584 --> 00:59:52.084
Deep down, I love you too.

663
00:59:55.389 --> 00:59:57.189
Father, just do us a favor.

664
00:59:58.325 --> 01:00:01.259
Do us both a favor
and sign the application.


665
01:00:20.347 --> 01:00:22.814
- Ow!
- Get out of my house, you little bastard!


666
01:00:22.816 --> 01:00:25.217
- Get out!
- Son of a bitch!


667
01:00:45.539 --> 01:00:46.571
Hello.

668
01:00:56.049 --> 01:00:59.684
The results of the clinical
trials are unbelievable.


669
01:00:59.686 --> 01:01:02.087
The treatment is still
experimental, of course,


670
01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:03.555
but we have a real chance here.

671
01:01:04.658 --> 01:01:08.193
Is it getting any closer
to being approved by the FDA?


672
01:01:08.195 --> 01:01:10.662
The approval process hasn't
even started yet.


673
01:01:10.664 --> 01:01:12.631
It could take months or years.

674
01:01:12.633 --> 01:01:16.635
But I have a contact at CenterWatch
with access to the treatment.


675
01:01:17.437 --> 01:01:19.070
I can get it for you.

676
01:01:19.072 --> 01:01:21.840
But it has to be
strictly confidential.


677
01:01:21.842 --> 01:01:25.410
What we're doing
here is illegal.


678
01:01:25.412 --> 01:01:27.612
You cannot tell anyone,
do you understand?


679
01:01:28.782 --> 01:01:30.315
Yeah, I understand.

680
01:01:32.252 --> 01:01:36.421
And the side effects
for the heart are aggressive.


681
01:01:36.423 --> 01:01:40.091
So you would need to take it easy for
a couple of weeks, can you do that?


682
01:01:41.595 --> 01:01:42.661
Yeah. Absolutely.

683
01:01:43.797 --> 01:01:45.197
When can we start?

684
01:01:46.266 --> 01:01:48.333
I can get it shipped
to me tomorrow.


685
01:01:52.105 --> 01:01:54.973
Thank you, Angie.

686
01:01:58.879 --> 01:02:00.378
Uh...

687
01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:04.850
We can meet at my office.
We'll have privacy there.


688
01:02:04.852 --> 01:02:06.952
Enjoy these days
with your family, Mike.


689
01:03:03.310 --> 01:03:04.709
It's all over the place.

690
01:03:05.946 --> 01:03:08.546
We have to stop it
until it calms down.


691
01:03:15.022 --> 01:03:20.191
It's not our problem.
I don't give a damn about him.


692
01:03:25.032 --> 01:03:27.465
Well, then,
you better do it fast.


693
01:03:28.268 --> 01:03:29.367
Because...

694
01:03:31.204 --> 01:03:32.604
I have to call you back.

695
01:03:34.041 --> 01:03:35.273
Mike, what are you doing here?

696
01:03:35.275 --> 01:03:37.676
Sorry if this is a bad time.

697
01:03:41.114 --> 01:03:46.217
So, it looks like I might
have some hope after all.


698
01:03:46.219 --> 01:03:51.189
Uh, I'm gonna be starting
this experimental


699
01:03:51.792 --> 01:03:53.825
treatment for my condition.

700
01:03:53.827 --> 01:04:00.165
There's a really big chance that
I might not end up like my father.


701
01:04:00.167 --> 01:04:02.701
Mike, I hope you don't
find this insensitive,


702
01:04:02.703 --> 01:04:06.237
that's fantastic news.
I'm very happy for you.


703
01:04:06.239 --> 01:04:08.907
But you need
an appointment to see me.


704
01:04:08.909 --> 01:04:10.408
Yes, sorry, are you moving?

705
01:04:10.978 --> 01:04:11.977
You need to go now.

706
01:04:11.979 --> 01:04:14.312
Uh, okay, look sorry.

707
01:04:14.314 --> 01:04:16.748
I don't know what's
going on here, but uh...


708
01:04:17.818 --> 01:04:19.818
I don't want to die anymore.

709
01:04:21.555 --> 01:04:22.654
That's great.

710
01:04:23.256 --> 01:04:25.056
I told you you weren't ready.

711
01:04:25.058 --> 01:04:28.693
Right. And you were
absolutely right, so,


712
01:04:28.695 --> 01:04:32.630
maybe you can let everyone else
in the group know as well.


713
01:04:33.533 --> 01:04:34.666
Okay, I will.

714
01:04:34.668 --> 01:04:39.704
Because like, I'm gonna be fine,
you understand and...


715
01:04:40.374 --> 01:04:43.541
I won't be needing help anymore.

716
01:04:43.543 --> 01:04:47.112
That's fine, Mike, you don't have to
come back anymore if you don't want to.


717
01:04:47.114 --> 01:04:48.380
Now have a good day.

718
01:04:48.382 --> 01:04:51.783
No, no, no, I'm not talking
about therapy, okay.


719
01:04:54.287 --> 01:04:56.554
I'm talking about the Chain.

720
01:04:57.557 --> 01:05:00.525
I'm not sure
I understand.


721
01:05:02.396 --> 01:05:06.831
I think you do, okay.
Piedad told me everything.


722
01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:09.501
She told me
that the links meet here.


723
01:05:10.504 --> 01:05:12.370
Mike, you're not
making any sense.


724
01:05:12.372 --> 01:05:14.973
I saw you give Brandon
the thumbs up.


725
01:05:14.975 --> 01:05:19.677
I know that you're behind it,
okay. I need you to stop it.


726
01:05:21.014 --> 01:05:22.847
Let me give you
some advice, Mike.


727
01:05:24.551 --> 01:05:28.420
You shouldn't be talking
so freely out loud.


728
01:05:28.422 --> 01:05:32.690
People may think that you are
associated with Piedad's death.


729
01:05:32.692 --> 01:05:36.561
She didn't wat to kill herself, so maybe
she asked someone else to help her.


730
01:05:37.464 --> 01:05:39.597
The cops have already been here.

731
01:05:39.599 --> 01:05:42.167
They've been looking for people,
asking for names.


732
01:05:42.169 --> 01:05:45.670
And you look a lot like
the suspect in the news.


733
01:05:50.043 --> 01:05:52.077
I just want out
of the Chain.


734
01:05:52.079 --> 01:05:54.479
If you ever come close
to me again,


735
01:05:54.481 --> 01:05:56.915
I'm gonna have to call
the police and your family.


736
01:05:56.917 --> 01:05:58.249
Do you understand?

737
01:05:59.953 --> 01:06:01.753
Vilma, please, I beg you.

738
01:06:02.222 --> 01:06:03.855
Goodbye, Mike!

739
01:06:18.305 --> 01:06:19.337
Hey.

740
01:06:21.708 --> 01:06:22.841
Hey.

741
01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:25.343
Hey, wait! Who are you?

742
01:06:25.745 --> 01:06:27.745
Wait! Wait!

743
01:06:29.249 --> 01:06:31.583
Hey, wait, we need to talk.

744
01:06:31.585 --> 01:06:33.685
I don't want
to die anymore, okay!


745
01:06:34.321 --> 01:06:35.720
Hey, did you hear me?

746
01:06:58.178 --> 01:07:00.745
<i>Every death is
a tragedy, Howard.</i>


747
01:07:00.747 --> 01:07:03.648
<i>And it is my job to help
people with depression</i>


748
01:07:03.650 --> 01:07:06.618
<i>get through their hole,
so to speak.</i>


749
01:07:06.620 --> 01:07:09.420
<i>Suicide is happening
across America.</i>


750
01:07:09.422 --> 01:07:12.957
<i>For every murder,
there are four suicides.</i>


751
01:07:12.959 --> 01:07:16.828
<i>You might not agree with me
or with Brandon's actions,</i>


752
01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:21.366
<i>but stigmatizing suicide
will only make it worse.</i>


753
01:08:09.449 --> 01:08:11.149
What the fuck did you do?

754
01:08:11.151 --> 01:08:12.383
What, excuse me?

755
01:08:12.886 --> 01:08:14.319
We had a deal.

756
01:08:14.321 --> 01:08:17.422
I told you the treatment
had to be confidential.


757
01:08:17.424 --> 01:08:19.924
Wait, wait, uh, what?

758
01:08:19.926 --> 01:08:24.762
Vilma called me last night and asked
about your experimental treatment.


759
01:08:25.565 --> 01:08:27.665
You're jeopardizing my career.

760
01:08:27.667 --> 01:08:30.635
Look, I'm sorry, I just...
I had to give her a reason


761
01:08:30.637 --> 01:08:32.904
for not coming back to the sessions.
I mean, she wouldn't let me go


762
01:08:32.906 --> 01:08:34.038
unless... I had to.

763
01:08:35.108 --> 01:08:36.407
I promise it won't happen again.

764
01:08:36.409 --> 01:08:38.676
Mike, this was a bad idea.

765
01:08:39.913 --> 01:08:42.247
I, I, I can't trust you anymore.

766
01:08:42.249 --> 01:08:45.116
No, no, no, no, no.
Please, Angie.


767
01:08:45.118 --> 01:08:49.454
You gotta help me.
You're my last chance to survive.


768
01:08:52.993 --> 01:08:54.726
I'm willing to take the risks.

769
01:09:03.603 --> 01:09:08.139
Did you, uh, send my dad
to Vilma after he was diagnosed?


770
01:09:08.141 --> 01:09:12.744
I recommended him to go,
but you know how proud he is.


771
01:09:21.054 --> 01:09:22.954
Are you okay?

772
01:09:22.956 --> 01:09:24.188
Phew.

773
01:09:24.190 --> 01:09:26.090
I told you the treatment
is aggressive.


774
01:09:46.546 --> 01:09:48.146
I hope you don't mind.
I took one of yours.


775
01:09:55.789 --> 01:10:00.091
Now, I didn't know you went to
therapy right after you got diagnosed.


776
01:10:00.093 --> 01:10:03.661
Shrinks are for crazy people.

777
01:10:03.663 --> 01:10:06.564
You went to Vilma's therapy group
though, didn't you?


778
01:10:06.866 --> 01:10:07.932
Hmm?

779
01:10:11.504 --> 01:10:13.404
I don't believe I know her.

780
01:10:13.406 --> 01:10:15.440
Did you get to know
Piedad Lopez?


781
01:10:15.442 --> 01:10:17.408
You know, the one with all
the plastic surgery.


782
01:10:20.347 --> 01:10:21.813
Did they tell you
about the Chain?


783
01:10:26.086 --> 01:10:27.618
What did they tell you about it?

784
01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:30.154
Michael dear, guess what?

785
01:10:30.156 --> 01:10:32.423
I found you another shirt.

786
01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.493
I don't know how
that other one just vanished.


787
01:10:36.262 --> 01:10:38.429
Like socks in a dryer,
I suppose.


788
01:10:39.766 --> 01:10:41.499
I didn't know you smoked, too.

789
01:10:43.036 --> 01:10:47.171
Anyway, I got one for you, too.
They were on sale.


790
01:10:49.342 --> 01:10:50.708
Why don't you try it on?

791
01:10:52.278 --> 01:10:53.945
I think it'll look
lovely on you.


792
01:11:27.514 --> 01:11:30.214
Like I said,
your life, your rules.


793
01:11:30.216 --> 01:11:32.116
That's how the Chain works.

794
01:11:32.118 --> 01:11:35.520
You and your assigned link
can figure all the details out.


795
01:11:37.557 --> 01:11:40.091
Here's the contact information
you'll need.


796
01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:08.219
Yes, good morning, ma'am,
I'd like to book suite 1010 for tonight.


797
01:12:10.423 --> 01:12:12.623
Mmm-hmm. Thank you.

798
01:12:21.167 --> 01:12:23.768
Relax. You need to relax.

799
01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:29.874
- Mike, hello?
- Shit, that's my wife.


800
01:12:36.015 --> 01:12:39.317
Hey, sweetheart, ahem,
do you need anything?


801
01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:42.453
Sorry to interrupt.

802
01:12:42.455 --> 01:12:46.657
This is Dr. Ryan, my father's physician,
and Dr. Ryan, this is my wife, Sarah.


803
01:12:46.659 --> 01:12:48.759
Nice to meet you.

804
01:12:48.761 --> 01:12:51.529
- How is he?
- Stable.


805
01:12:51.531 --> 01:12:54.832
But there isn't much more
we can do for him.


806
01:12:57.504 --> 01:13:01.072
Call me if you need
anything else.


807
01:13:01.074 --> 01:13:03.140
It was nice to meet you, too.

808
01:13:23.196 --> 01:13:24.328
Um...

809
01:13:25.231 --> 01:13:28.032
Do you mind if we talk at home.

810
01:13:28.034 --> 01:13:29.967
I'm just kind of busy.

811
01:13:34.707 --> 01:13:36.007
I called Rebecca.

812
01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:39.944
The practice has been closed
for weeks now.


813
01:13:41.481 --> 01:13:44.048
All those night surgeries,
all of that...


814
01:13:44.984 --> 01:13:47.051
paperwork that
you had to finish...


815
01:13:48.955 --> 01:13:49.921
Lies.

816
01:13:51.491 --> 01:13:53.791
I kind of really
fucked up, babe.


817
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:58.062
Are you having an affair?

818
01:13:59.399 --> 01:14:02.166
No. No. Absolutely not.

819
01:14:04.404 --> 01:14:06.137
Please, just be honest with me.

820
01:14:11.144 --> 01:14:12.310
My father...

821
01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.180
is pretending to be sick.

822
01:14:16.182 --> 01:14:17.982
He's been lying to us all
since the beginning.


823
01:14:17.984 --> 01:14:20.384
He told me himself.
He just wanted me to come back here.


824
01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.653
I was sick.

825
01:14:23.489 --> 01:14:24.855
But I'm getting better.

826
01:14:24.857 --> 01:14:26.691
That's why Dr. 
Ryan was here.

827
01:14:26.693 --> 01:14:30.061
But I... I didn't want to tell you
because I didn't want you to worry.


828
01:14:30.363 --> 01:14:31.662
Okay?

829
01:14:33.132 --> 01:14:35.399
But someone is going
to kill me if I don't stop them.


830
01:14:35.401 --> 01:14:39.203
And I'm pretty sure my father has information
about the Chain. He just won't tell me.


831
01:14:40.106 --> 01:14:41.172
Mike.

832
01:14:42.675 --> 01:14:44.742
You need to go to therapy.
You're losing your mind.


833
01:14:44.744 --> 01:14:46.210
Don't you ever say that.

834
01:14:46.212 --> 01:14:47.878
Get away from me!

835
01:15:29.722 --> 01:15:32.757
Excuse me, I have a reservation.

836
01:15:32.759 --> 01:15:35.292
Yeah. First time staying
with us, sir?


837
01:15:35.294 --> 01:15:36.927
Uh, yeah.

838
01:15:49.809 --> 01:15:51.742
You look pretty different
with the beard.


839
01:15:52.712 --> 01:15:53.911
You look better now.

840
01:15:56.949 --> 01:15:59.884
Welcome, Mr. Coleman.
It is suite 1010.


841
01:16:01.654 --> 01:16:02.920
Enjoy your stay.

842
01:16:13.766 --> 01:16:15.099
Help me.

843
01:16:17.336 --> 01:16:19.503
Mike, help me.

844
01:16:26.846 --> 01:16:28.813
Piedad, there's nothing
I can do for you.


845
01:16:30.383 --> 01:16:31.549
You're dead.

846
01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:05.182
Well, well, well,
look who we have here.


847
01:17:05.184 --> 01:17:07.351
Returning to the crime scene,
Dr. Coleman.


848
01:17:07.353 --> 01:17:08.385
Uh...

849
01:17:15.128 --> 01:17:19.029
- Do you mind if we go talk someplace else?
- Sure.


850
01:17:19.031 --> 01:17:21.265
There's a bar nearby.
I think you know it.


851
01:17:22.368 --> 01:17:24.168
<i>The Chain?</i>

852
01:17:24.169 --> 01:17:25.969
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's true.


853
01:17:25.972 --> 01:17:27.638
You need to stop them.

854
01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.508
Hello, stranger.
What can I get you?


855
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:31.575
A coke, please.

856
01:17:31.577 --> 01:17:34.044
- I'll have the same.
- Two cokes.


857
01:17:34.046 --> 01:17:35.613
Is your friend
joining you today?


858
01:17:36.082 --> 01:17:36.947
Excuse me?

859
01:17:36.949 --> 01:17:38.382
The lady
that you always come with.


860
01:17:41.621 --> 01:17:44.388
No, no, she's not coming today.

861
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:46.957
Oh, be right back.

862
01:17:52.365 --> 01:17:53.364
So...

863
01:17:54.801 --> 01:17:56.667
you know how to find
who killed Miss Lopez.


864
01:17:56.669 --> 01:18:00.905
Yes. Uh, Vilma. You have to
investigate Vilma, the therapist, okay?


865
01:18:00.907 --> 01:18:02.273
Everyone who's been to...

866
01:18:12.084 --> 01:18:16.687
I went back to the hotel to try
and find Piedad's notebook, okay.


867
01:18:16.689 --> 01:18:20.291
She wrote down everything. Okay.
There's bound to be some names in there.


868
01:18:20.293 --> 01:18:23.294
We searched her room.
It was empty.


869
01:18:24.697 --> 01:18:27.798
Okay. Sure.

870
01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:32.770
Look, Mike, I need you to come down
in the morning. Give a statement.


871
01:18:32.772 --> 01:18:35.639
If everything you're saying is
true, we will help you.


872
01:18:36.776 --> 01:18:38.309
But you gotta
tell us everything.


873
01:18:39.212 --> 01:18:40.911
And stop playing detective.

874
01:18:44.417 --> 01:18:47.585
Oh, my God, that's him.

875
01:18:54.861 --> 01:18:56.594
Hey, stop!

876
01:18:56.596 --> 01:18:57.928
I don't want to die anymore!

877
01:19:06.205 --> 01:19:07.771
You saw that, right?

878
01:19:07.773 --> 01:19:10.774
You saw that it wasn't my fault.
He just came out of nowhere.


879
01:19:10.776 --> 01:19:11.942
Look, just get back in your car.

880
01:19:11.944 --> 01:19:13.444
- I know, but it wasn't my fault.
- I'm a doctor.


881
01:19:13.446 --> 01:19:14.678
Call an ambulance!

882
01:19:15.147 --> 01:19:16.113
Okay.

883
01:20:33.626 --> 01:20:35.726
- There's no need to keep pretending, Father.
- Hmm?


884
01:20:38.064 --> 01:20:39.430
I know you're my link.

885
01:20:40.132 --> 01:20:41.832
How was your day, son?

886
01:20:41.834 --> 01:20:43.067
I hope you're hungry.

887
01:20:43.069 --> 01:20:45.469
Starving. Quite a busy day.

888
01:20:46.172 --> 01:20:49.473
Well, Sarah is a gem.

889
01:20:49.475 --> 01:20:53.310
She went to the market, bought a big duck.
She's been cooking all day.


890
01:20:53.312 --> 01:20:54.278
Hmm.

891
01:21:12.732 --> 01:21:13.764
I'm sorry.

892
01:21:16.402 --> 01:21:17.468
For everything.

893
01:21:20.973 --> 01:21:25.109
I haven't been myself lately.
And I'm gonna put an end to it.


894
01:21:28.581 --> 01:21:29.613
I love you.

895
01:21:35.955 --> 01:21:38.255
You better get
your shit together, Mike.


896
01:21:40.159 --> 01:21:42.359
I don't even know
who you're becoming.


897
01:21:45.698 --> 01:21:48.365
I'm gonna prove to you
that my father is faking.


898
01:21:50.169 --> 01:21:51.769
He wants to kill me.

899
01:21:55.508 --> 01:21:56.540
Stop it.

900
01:21:59.412 --> 01:22:00.411
You'll see.

901
01:22:08.287 --> 01:22:12.022
These potatoes are out of this world.
You used thyme, right?


902
01:22:12.024 --> 01:22:13.857
Um, yeah, I did. Um...

903
01:22:13.859 --> 01:22:18.095
But the key was to precook them in the
microwave before I put them in the oven.


904
01:22:18.097 --> 01:22:21.265
Really? I never would
have thought of that.


905
01:22:23.235 --> 01:22:26.036
Mom, let him do it.

906
01:22:26.038 --> 01:22:30.507
Your dad can't
coordinate his hands well enough.


907
01:22:30.509 --> 01:22:33.911
Mom, if he can hit you,
he can feed himself.


908
01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:36.480
Mike!

909
01:22:36.482 --> 01:22:38.449
You can feed yourself,
can't you, Father?


910
01:22:39.385 --> 01:22:40.584
Show 'em.

911
01:22:40.586 --> 01:22:43.654
Son, let's just have
a nice family dinner.


912
01:22:44.623 --> 01:22:45.789
Mike, stop it.

913
01:22:46.659 --> 01:22:48.692
What are you doing?

914
01:22:48.694 --> 01:22:50.427
We're not helping him
get better, Mom.


915
01:22:51.697 --> 01:22:53.764
Eat.

916
01:22:53.766 --> 01:22:55.666
He can't do it by himself.

917
01:22:55.668 --> 01:22:57.734
Yes, he can. I've seen it.

918
01:22:57.736 --> 01:22:59.903
Come on, just a little bite.

919
01:23:02.174 --> 01:23:04.808
Sarah spent all day
working on this meal for you.


920
01:23:07.513 --> 01:23:09.813
Come on.
We both know you can do it.


921
01:23:14.053 --> 01:23:15.319
Eat!

922
01:23:30.069 --> 01:23:32.836
Sometimes you just gotta be a
little hard on him for his own good.


923
01:23:32.838 --> 01:23:34.204
Right, Ma?

924
01:23:35.007 --> 01:23:36.373
That's what he always said.

925
01:23:44.049 --> 01:23:45.249
Phew!

926
01:23:50.923 --> 01:23:54.858
Sarah, would you take care of
Michael tomorrow, around 4:00?


927
01:23:54.860 --> 01:23:58.195
I'd really like to go to
Claire's daughter's baby shower.


928
01:23:58.197 --> 01:23:59.530
I can do it, Mom.

929
01:24:00.933 --> 01:24:02.332
Sarah's got rehearsals.

930
01:24:02.334 --> 01:24:03.967
You know,
the kid's recital's on Friday.


931
01:24:03.969 --> 01:24:05.802
I have zero patients tomorrow.

932
01:24:07.773 --> 01:24:09.940
I don't mind, really.

933
01:25:05.331 --> 01:25:07.231
There's some pudding left
in the fridge, if you're hungry.


934
01:25:07.233 --> 01:25:09.399
Thanks, Mom.
Have fun. Don't worry.


935
01:25:30.689 --> 01:25:31.722
Father.

936
01:25:54.046 --> 01:25:55.445
Father, where are you?

937
01:26:55.674 --> 01:26:57.107
Father, what are you doing?

938
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:58.575
Following your instructions.

939
01:26:58.577 --> 01:27:00.911
It'll look like you hit
your head against the tub.


940
01:27:00.913 --> 01:27:02.045
It was an accident.

941
01:27:03.749 --> 01:27:06.416
I don't want to die anymore.
There's a cure for me.


942
01:27:06.418 --> 01:27:08.318
Oh, there's no cure, you fool.

943
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:27.104
Come on.

944
01:27:28.674 --> 01:27:31.908
Now we're even!
You're never gonna see Mom or me again,


945
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:34.144
or that fucking nurse
of yours, do you hear me?


946
01:27:40.619 --> 01:27:41.918
Oh!

947
01:27:59.705 --> 01:28:01.037
How are you feeling?

948
01:28:05.611 --> 01:28:08.178
- My father...
- Mike.


949
01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:12.048
It's gonna be difficult,
but you need to try to remain calm, okay.


950
01:28:12.618 --> 01:28:14.718
Your father passed away.

951
01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:18.822
He fell and hit his head
and drowned in the bathtub.


952
01:28:18.824 --> 01:28:23.160
You had a heart attack,
when you were trying to help him.


953
01:28:23.162 --> 01:28:24.661
We almost lost you.

954
01:28:26.799 --> 01:28:28.665
Dr. Ryan came
to see you last night.


955
01:28:28.667 --> 01:28:31.835
She said that you need to rest.
No more craziness.


956
01:28:31.837 --> 01:28:34.905
Just a couple of days in bed.
Avoid stress at all costs.


957
01:28:35.507 --> 01:28:36.673
You got it?

958
01:28:37.843 --> 01:28:38.975
Hmm.

959
01:28:40.746 --> 01:28:43.547
Sarah, I don't want
to be here anymore.


960
01:28:46.051 --> 01:28:49.286
I want to get out of this house and
I want to go back to San Francisco.


961
01:28:52.024 --> 01:28:53.757
You get better.

962
01:28:53.759 --> 01:28:56.760
Rest a couple of days,
and then we'll go wherever you want.


963
01:29:00.232 --> 01:29:02.199
I have to go now.

964
01:29:02.201 --> 01:29:05.969
Your mom is alone at the funeral home.
I'll be back, okay.


965
01:30:37.296 --> 01:30:38.328
Yeah, Detective Darcy.

966
01:30:39.598 --> 01:30:41.031
Yeah, I'd like
to make my statement.


967
01:30:57.282 --> 01:30:58.782
What is she doing here?

968
01:30:59.351 --> 01:31:01.017
Mike, please, sit down.

969
01:31:09.795 --> 01:31:10.994
What the fuck is this?

970
01:31:13.632 --> 01:31:17.367
Isn't it clear?
Exactly what you wanted.


971
01:31:17.369 --> 01:31:20.670
She's killing you,
making it look like a natural death.


972
01:31:20.672 --> 01:31:25.141
Digitoxin doesn't leave a trace in
the blood stream. You know that.


973
01:31:25.677 --> 01:31:27.277
"Your life. Your rules."

974
01:31:28.580 --> 01:31:29.813
Mike.

975
01:31:32.117 --> 01:31:34.284
Mike, Piedad used you.

976
01:31:34.286 --> 01:31:39.456
She invited you to the Chain because
Vilma didn't let her link to help her.


977
01:31:39.458 --> 01:31:43.660
So, she decided to rearrange
things behind our backs.


978
01:31:43.662 --> 01:31:48.231
In order to be helped by the Chain,
you must have Vilma's and my permission.


979
01:31:48.233 --> 01:31:51.901
I make sure the patients medical
conditions are irreversible.


980
01:31:51.903 --> 01:31:54.471
And she makes sure they're
ready for the final step.


981
01:31:55.474 --> 01:31:57.407
Obviously,
she didn't have either.


982
01:31:58.844 --> 01:32:00.377
So the treatment was a lie.

983
01:32:02.914 --> 01:32:05.782
You should be thankful
to Dr. Ryan.


984
01:32:05.784 --> 01:32:09.786
After you and Piedad messed up,
I stopped the Chain.


985
01:32:09.788 --> 01:32:12.122
But she still wanted
to help you.


986
01:32:12.124 --> 01:32:15.358
We need to stop this
until it calms down.


987
01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:16.559
It's all over the place.

988
01:32:16.561 --> 01:32:18.228
<i>I can't abandon him now,</i>

989
01:32:18.230 --> 01:32:20.897
I brought him into this.
He's expecting a link to help him die.


990
01:32:20.899 --> 01:32:23.733
<i>I don't give a damn about him.
He is not our problem.</i>


991
01:32:25.303 --> 01:32:29.205
It was the only way
I could follow your rules.


992
01:32:30.842 --> 01:32:33.743
The truth is
that there is no cure.


993
01:32:33.745 --> 01:32:38.281
Your heart is already very weak. One more
dose and you will die of a heart attack.


994
01:32:38.283 --> 01:32:40.216
No one will ever know.

995
01:32:47.459 --> 01:32:48.758
Did you get all that?

996
01:32:50.796 --> 01:32:52.896
It's a full confession.
Arrest them.


997
01:32:55.534 --> 01:32:57.033
Mike, who are you talking to?

998
01:32:58.603 --> 01:33:00.537
This is Detective Darcy
of the LAPD.


999
01:33:03.375 --> 01:33:05.475
There's no one there, Mike.

1000
01:33:13.285 --> 01:33:15.952
I was being investigated
by insurance companies.


1001
01:33:17.656 --> 01:33:19.189
There's pictures, there's...

1002
01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:22.826
There's a video.

1003
01:33:22.828 --> 01:33:26.963
<i>You have to
investigate Vilma, the therapist.</i>


1004
01:33:29.568 --> 01:33:31.201
<i>Thank you.</i>

1005
01:33:31.203 --> 01:33:34.104
Look, I went back to the hotel to
try and find Piedad's notebook.


1006
01:33:34.106 --> 01:33:36.573
<i>She wrote everything down.
There's bound to be something...</i>


1007
01:33:52.591 --> 01:33:54.390
Wait, what...

1008
01:33:56.428 --> 01:33:58.194
What about my father?

1009
01:34:01.366 --> 01:34:03.032
What about him?

1010
01:34:03.034 --> 01:34:04.868
He told me he was my link.

1011
01:34:06.538 --> 01:34:08.505
He went to your therapy group.

1012
01:34:10.041 --> 01:34:12.142
I've never met
your father, Mike.


1013
01:34:13.712 --> 01:34:15.145
You sent him there.

1014
01:34:15.981 --> 01:34:18.214
That's how he became
a part of the Chain.


1015
01:34:22.354 --> 01:34:24.220
Come on.

1016
01:34:29.294 --> 01:34:32.262
Uh, Pie, Pie, Piedad.

1017
01:34:32.264 --> 01:34:34.931
She wrote down his name
in her notebook.


1018
01:34:47.045 --> 01:34:49.979
Your father could
barely move or talk.


1019
01:35:15.674 --> 01:35:17.340
I thought he wanted to die.

1020
01:35:20.912 --> 01:35:22.245
I was just trying to help him.

1021
01:35:23.782 --> 01:35:26.416
<i>If Mom finds out
about this,</i>


1022
01:35:26.418 --> 01:35:29.185
she's going to agree to send
you to a fucking nursing home.


1023
01:35:31.389 --> 01:35:33.556
I never asked or wanted
your damn practice.


1024
01:35:35.126 --> 01:35:36.626
I am nothing like you!
