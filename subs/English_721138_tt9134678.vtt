1
00:00:01.892 --> 00:00:04.661
<i>I'd like to start by sharing
a very traumatic experience</i>


2
00:00:04.695 --> 00:00:06.295
<i>that affected me as a child.</i>

3
00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:08.765
<i>When I was five years old,
I lost my father</i>


4
00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.267
<i>to a degenerative
spinal injury.</i>


5
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.469
<i>While my father's illness
ended his life,</i>


6
00:00:13.502 --> 00:00:16.339
<i>it, ironically,
was the catalyst for me</i>


7
00:00:16.372 --> 00:00:18.374
<i>to truly start my own.</i>

8
00:00:18.407 --> 00:00:21.845
<i>I vowed to spend my life
finding a solution.</i>


9
00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.253
- Move.
- Hey, what's wrong with you?


10
00:01:08.892 --> 00:01:10.559
Fucking dog.

11
00:03:27.063 --> 00:03:29.065
Jesus, Cam,
you look like shit.


12
00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.466
Come on inside.

13
00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:32.602
Some of us don't get
ten hours a night, Mort.


14
00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:37.339
- How was that vacation?
- I wouldn't call it that.


15
00:03:37.373 --> 00:03:39.609
And how are things
with the wife?


16
00:03:39.643 --> 00:03:40.944
Don't ask.

17
00:03:40.977 --> 00:03:43.512
Where's the big boss?

18
00:03:43.546 --> 00:03:45.015
Cam!

19
00:03:45.048 --> 00:03:48.852
You know, I didn't hire the baddest
motherfucker on the planet to protect me


20
00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:50.787
just to have him disappear.

21
00:03:50.821 --> 00:03:51.955
Don't like it
when you're not around.


22
00:03:51.988 --> 00:03:54.691
Yeah, it's because a lot of
people want to kill you, Leor.


23
00:03:54.724 --> 00:03:57.493
This fucking guy.

24
00:03:57.526 --> 00:04:00.396
- I love you, Cam.
- Leor, what time is it?


25
00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.766
It's a... Oh, shit,
I forgot my watch.


26
00:04:04.533 --> 00:04:07.838
See? No more
vacations for you.


27
00:04:07.871 --> 00:04:10.372
Margaret!
Margaret, darling.


28
00:04:11.473 --> 00:04:12.609
Bring my watch,
the Poirier.


29
00:04:12.642 --> 00:04:13.710
The gold one,
not the stainless.


30
00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.117
- Thanks for babysitting.
- No problem.


31
00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:22.719
It's literally
babysitting, though.


32
00:04:22.752 --> 00:04:24.087
Yeah, good days,
bad days.


33
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.990
Speaking of that,
how's the shoulder?


34
00:04:27.023 --> 00:04:28.390
I'll live.

35
00:04:28.424 --> 00:04:29.860
Not much longer
you keep playing hero.


36
00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:32.596
Someone's got to do it.

37
00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:23.980
This is team leader.

38
00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:26.616
I have visuals
on the target building.


39
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.784
No signs of enemy.

40
00:05:32.255 --> 00:05:33.890
<i>Status, team leader?</i>

41
00:05:33.924 --> 00:05:36.492
Apache One,
moving to Ridge Point.


42
00:06:05.021 --> 00:06:06.189
Clear.

43
00:06:08.191 --> 00:06:09.960
Chief, what's going on?

44
00:06:09.993 --> 00:06:11.661
Where the fuck
is everyone?


45
00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:15.131
I don't like it either.

46
00:06:15.165 --> 00:06:16.800
Stay on mission, move up.

47
00:06:21.004 --> 00:06:23.239
The amazing thing
about this project is,


48
00:06:23.273 --> 00:06:25.642
it's never been done before.

49
00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:27.944
Never even been attempted,

50
00:06:27.978 --> 00:06:30.847
because the technology
hasn't kept up.


51
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.884
But my company has been on
the forefront of this.


52
00:06:34.918 --> 00:06:38.088
And now, I would like
to introduce you


53
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:41.024
to our first
successful operation.


54
00:06:41.057 --> 00:06:42.926
Our patient zero,
if you will.


55
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:46.696
This is Roger.

56
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.666
His arm was lost
in an IED explosion


57
00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.701
that almost killed him.

58
00:06:51.735 --> 00:06:54.204
We were able
to successfully fuse


59
00:06:54.237 --> 00:06:58.540
a Phoenix biotech arm that
actually functions now


60
00:06:58.574 --> 00:07:02.012
by use of Roger's
central nervous system.


61
00:07:02.045 --> 00:07:05.148
This technology isn't just
for military application,


62
00:07:05.181 --> 00:07:08.018
it's also for civilians
of all walks of life...


63
00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:12.155
Children who can't walk,
can't hug their parents.


64
00:07:14.024 --> 00:07:18.862
And in the future,
we can go even farther.


65
00:07:18.895 --> 00:07:21.898
All this coming from a man who's
had multiple attempts on his life.


66
00:07:21.931 --> 00:07:25.869
In the most recent attempt, your head of
security was shot and he almost lost his life.


67
00:07:25.902 --> 00:07:27.904
So, how do you stay
so optimistic?


68
00:07:29.873 --> 00:07:34.778
We can only realize our true
potential through adversity.


69
00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:39.249
That's why I call my company
The Phoenix Group.


70
00:07:39.282 --> 00:07:41.051
We rise up through the ashes.

71
00:08:21.024 --> 00:08:22.826
You're just in time, Leor.

72
00:08:22.859 --> 00:08:24.928
John, I fucking love
this guy.


73
00:08:24.961 --> 00:08:28.832
Always ready to get the party started.
Look at that.


74
00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:31.334
<i>I believe we all have
a responsibility</i>


75
00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:33.136
<i>for the well-being
of our fellow man.</i>


76
00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:38.108
They're so blown away by technology
I developed like a decade ago.


77
00:08:38.141 --> 00:08:40.710
So archaic compared
to our new project.


78
00:08:40.743 --> 00:08:42.879
Well, we need to run
a successful test


79
00:08:42.912 --> 00:08:44.314
to prove that it works.

80
00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:51.421
Yes, John, all right.

81
00:08:51.454 --> 00:08:55.925
We've had some teething problems
but I think we're close.


82
00:08:55.959 --> 00:08:58.862
I think we just need
the right test subject.


83
00:08:58.895 --> 00:09:00.230
Well, the good news is,

84
00:09:00.263 --> 00:09:02.966
we may have a few subjects

85
00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:04.434
that just might fit the bill.

86
00:09:04.467 --> 00:09:07.103
- Then here's to success.
- Success.


87
00:09:08.271 --> 00:09:10.440
<i>The amazing thing

88
00:09:10.473 --> 00:09:12.308

89
00:09:12.342 --> 00:09:13.910

91
00:09:16.079 --> 00:09:20.049
<i>But my company has been

92
00:09:20.083 --> 00:09:21.251
<i>What do you think
of your critics</i>


93
00:09:21.284 --> 00:09:23.186
<i>who accuse you of playing God?</i>

94
00:10:50.073 --> 00:10:51.441
<i>Hello, this is Michelle.</i>

95
00:10:51.474 --> 00:10:54.444
<i>I can't come to the phone right
now, you know what to do.</i>


96
00:10:54.477 --> 00:10:56.179
Yeah, it's me.

97
00:10:59.282 --> 00:11:02.819
I tried you a couple of times,
uh, can't get ahold of you.


98
00:11:04.854 --> 00:11:07.090
I got some paperwork
from the lawyer.


99
00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:11.427
I think we should talk.

100
00:11:13.963 --> 00:11:15.965
Call me when you get a chance.

101
00:14:18.147 --> 00:14:21.585
His vitals are weak.
We're probably gonna lose him.


102
00:14:21.618 --> 00:14:26.055
No. No, not if I
can help it.


103
00:15:17.139 --> 00:15:18.642
Everyone, out.

104
00:15:33.857 --> 00:15:37.059
I will now engage the sonic
scanner to activate the nanites.


105
00:15:58.882 --> 00:16:00.751
<i>Status team leader.</i>

106
00:16:00.784 --> 00:16:03.286
<i>Where the fuck is everyone?</i>

107
00:16:03.319 --> 00:16:04.320
<i>Stay on mission.</i>

108
00:16:18.835 --> 00:16:20.804
<i>Hostage is confirmed,
the target's linked.</i>


109
00:16:23.874 --> 00:16:26.677
No! No!

110
00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:27.711
No!

111
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.088
Doctor, it's working.

112
00:17:15.926 --> 00:17:18.762
As you can see,
he's doing just fine.


113
00:17:18.795 --> 00:17:21.297
We are going to have to keep him
sedated a little while longer


114
00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:23.399
to monitor his progress

115
00:17:23.432 --> 00:17:25.902
and check
on any abnormalities.


116
00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:28.504
Look, I don't want to be
a wet blanket,


117
00:17:28.537 --> 00:17:31.642
but all I see is a soldier

118
00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:34.611
that was almost dead
who is now stable.


119
00:17:34.645 --> 00:17:37.914
Nothing miraculous about that.

120
00:17:37.948 --> 00:17:39.650
We need to run more tests

121
00:17:39.683 --> 00:17:43.352
to make sure that these micromachines
are working and responding.


122
00:17:43.386 --> 00:17:45.521
By all indications,

123
00:17:45.554 --> 00:17:47.456
the longer these nanites
stay in him,


124
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.325
the quicker
he's going to recover.


125
00:17:49.358 --> 00:17:51.695
This isn't project Band
-Aid.

126
00:17:51.728 --> 00:17:55.264
We call it Invincible
for a reason.


127
00:17:55.297 --> 00:17:56.833
When will the test start?

128
00:17:58.802 --> 00:18:00.937
Now is as good time as any.

129
00:18:14.383 --> 00:18:15.518
Jesus Christ.

130
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.220
Relax.

131
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.435
You call that a test?

132
00:19:35.766 --> 00:19:38.400
What the fuck, Michelle?

133
00:19:57.954 --> 00:20:00.523
Red alert, code one.
Red alert, code one.


134
00:20:05.762 --> 00:20:07.597
Everything's gonna be okay.
Calm down.


135
00:20:16.372 --> 00:20:18.809
No. No, no.

136
00:20:32.055 --> 00:20:33.522
No!

137
00:21:46.696 --> 00:21:48.698
Hold your fire, dammit!
Hold your fire!


138
00:21:51.935 --> 00:21:53.637
I know you.

139
00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:16.192
What the hell happened?

140
00:22:19.763 --> 00:22:20.864
Anyone?

141
00:22:21.865 --> 00:22:23.733
It's as unpredictable as...

142
00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:26.937
Don't give me none of that
ass-covering scientific bullshit.


143
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.471
Do you have any idea what kind
of position this puts us in?


144
00:22:29.505 --> 00:22:31.107
You wanted invincible.

145
00:22:31.141 --> 00:22:34.543
Oh, lady, you're here because you
tagged along with the old regime,


146
00:22:34.576 --> 00:22:35.845
so if you wanna
keep your job,


147
00:22:35.879 --> 00:22:37.047
keep your fucking mouth shut.

148
00:22:38.748 --> 00:22:41.685
I just heard.
This is crazy!


149
00:22:41.718 --> 00:22:44.220
This is just crazy!

150
00:22:44.254 --> 00:22:46.623
Why wasn't he contained?

151
00:22:46.656 --> 00:22:49.192
At least until we could understand
what was going to happen.


152
00:22:49.225 --> 00:22:51.628
This is experimental work.

153
00:22:51.661 --> 00:22:53.997
He showed no sign
of temperamental change.


154
00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:55.564
Everything was normal:

155
00:22:55.598 --> 00:22:58.034
His heart,
brain function, normal.


156
00:22:59.703 --> 00:23:02.973
That is definitely
not normal.


157
00:23:03.006 --> 00:23:06.076
We're still at the
infancy stage of this program.


158
00:23:06.109 --> 00:23:08.178
We don't know what these
machines can do to the brain.


159
00:23:08.211 --> 00:23:11.281
They could be suppressing,
agitating his thoughts,


160
00:23:11.314 --> 00:23:13.850
his emotion, his memories.

161
00:23:15.185 --> 00:23:18.121
It's possible that the dosage
that he received may wear off soon


162
00:23:18.154 --> 00:23:19.222
and he'll return to normal.

163
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.025
But we haven't even
completed the test


164
00:23:22.058 --> 00:23:23.660
with human subjects yet.

165
00:23:23.693 --> 00:23:27.030
Until then, we don't know
how long each dose lasts.


166
00:23:27.063 --> 00:23:29.565
We need to get him back
to run more tests.


167
00:23:29.599 --> 00:23:33.236
We've got a highly trained soldier
pumped up on some super-juice,


168
00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:36.572
and we don't know where the
fuck he is or what he's doing.


169
00:23:36.606 --> 00:23:38.842
And from the looks
of what happened here earlier,


170
00:23:38.875 --> 00:23:40.677
it'll probably be
a fucking mess.


171
00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.113
So, yes, I'd say
we need to get him back.


172
00:23:56.359 --> 00:23:57.994
I just don't know
what the fuck went wrong.


173
00:23:58.028 --> 00:23:59.696
I mean,
the technology was all...


174
00:24:01.631 --> 00:24:02.732
Oh, fuck.

175
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.735
This is a mess, Cam.

176
00:24:05.769 --> 00:24:07.804
Relax. I'll take care of it.

177
00:24:09.272 --> 00:24:10.974
I've got an old friend
who lives here.


178
00:24:11.007 --> 00:24:13.043
- He's a detective.
- Police?


179
00:24:13.076 --> 00:24:15.879
Don't worry, he's a friend.

180
00:24:15.912 --> 00:24:18.114
What's more important is,
we've got to get you out of here.


181
00:24:18.148 --> 00:24:21.217
I told you, killing monkeys is
one thing.


182
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:25.989
It's fucked up,
but this is on another level.


183
00:24:26.022 --> 00:24:29.325
If the press finds out,
if anyone finds out about this black site,


184
00:24:29.359 --> 00:24:31.027
they'll bury you.

185
00:24:33.329 --> 00:24:35.365
I'm putting you
on a plane back to L.A.


186
00:24:35.398 --> 00:24:37.000
I'll have Mort
pick you up at the airport.


187
00:24:37.033 --> 00:24:38.635
No. I have to stay.

188
00:24:38.668 --> 00:24:40.770
I have to find out
what the fuck went wrong.


189
00:24:40.804 --> 00:24:43.807
Leor, you pay me
to protect you.


190
00:24:44.941 --> 00:24:46.209
Let me do my job.

191
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.345
My clothes are at the hotel.

192
00:24:49.379 --> 00:24:51.247
Car. Now.

193
00:24:55.819 --> 00:24:57.687
Ever the hero.

194
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:02.625
You would know.

195
00:25:02.659 --> 00:25:05.361
You've been surrounded by them
your whole career.


196
00:25:05.395 --> 00:25:08.898
You were a hell of a soldier.
Look at you now.


197
00:25:08.932 --> 00:25:12.936
A burned out contractor looking for
answers in the bottom of a glass.


198
00:25:15.872 --> 00:25:18.174
You're still
just a high-ranking coward.


199
00:25:19.809 --> 00:25:21.811
Playing dice
with other people's lives.


200
00:25:26.983 --> 00:25:28.952
Fine, but here we are.

201
00:25:45.435 --> 00:25:47.437
He's on the way.

202
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:50.240
Black-out the press,
keep the house locked down.


203
00:25:50.273 --> 00:25:52.675
No, don't worry,
I'll lock 'im down.


204
00:25:52.709 --> 00:25:55.111
Put a lid on it.
The world is shut out.


205
00:25:55.145 --> 00:25:56.913
I'll call you later.

206
00:25:58.381 --> 00:25:59.782
Cam?

207
00:26:04.888 --> 00:26:07.123
- Hey, man.
- Thanks for coming.


208
00:26:07.157 --> 00:26:09.225
No problem, man.
Always...


209
00:26:09.259 --> 00:26:11.394
Always ready to help a brother.
You know I'm down.


210
00:26:13.062 --> 00:26:14.063
How's Michelle?

211
00:26:14.097 --> 00:26:15.832
She's okay.

212
00:26:15.865 --> 00:26:19.135
She's still, like,
living and working the same spots, but...


213
00:26:19.169 --> 00:26:21.938
Wait, I thought
this was about business.


214
00:26:21.971 --> 00:26:23.973
Yeah, right, business.

215
00:26:24.007 --> 00:26:26.309
- Let's get some coffee.
- Sounds good.


216
00:26:26.342 --> 00:26:27.710
You look great,
by the way.


217
00:26:29.879 --> 00:26:31.881
Everybody's got
a different opinion.


218
00:26:34.884 --> 00:26:38.054
Everything I'm about
to tell you is vaulted.


219
00:26:38.087 --> 00:26:40.423
Okay, got it.
Vaulted.


220
00:26:43.126 --> 00:26:45.128
Leor is funding a black site.

221
00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:48.097
It's why we're down here.

222
00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:51.000
It went south last night.

223
00:26:51.034 --> 00:26:54.003
Oh, fuck, man!
Black project?


224
00:26:54.037 --> 00:26:58.107
Oh, fuck, Cam, you know better
not to fuck with that shit.


225
00:26:58.141 --> 00:26:59.442
Come on.

226
00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:03.279
Yeah, my judgement's been
pretty impaired lately.


227
00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.052
Taylor's running it.

228
00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.388
That asshole?

229
00:27:14.157 --> 00:27:15.391
Yeah.

230
00:27:17.794 --> 00:27:22.832
One of the test subjects
escaped last night.


231
00:27:22.865 --> 00:27:25.902
Okay. This guy,

232
00:27:25.935 --> 00:27:28.471
he doesn't happen to be

233
00:27:28.504 --> 00:27:31.140
wrecking everything
in his path now, does he?


234
00:27:32.575 --> 00:27:34.377
Sounds like my guy.

235
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:38.381
He tore through a check-point,
two beat cops, man.


236
00:27:38.414 --> 00:27:42.151
We got ties to special police
mobilizing right now, man.


237
00:27:42.185 --> 00:27:44.087
Yeah, that's not
gonna be enough.


238
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:49.525
Come with me,
I want to show you something.


239
00:28:09.145 --> 00:28:10.913
This is
all the shit you got?


240
00:28:17.186 --> 00:28:20.823
Hey, asshole, back off.
Get the fuck back


241
00:28:20.857 --> 00:28:23.259
or I'll put you down
like a fucking dog.


242
00:28:24.894 --> 00:28:26.496
- Don't.
- You're dead.


243
00:28:34.237 --> 00:28:35.571
The keys.

244
00:28:44.648 --> 00:28:48.451
You know what, man? I get the
feeling


245
00:28:48.484 --> 00:28:50.253
there's more to this
than you're telling me.


246
00:28:54.557 --> 00:28:58.995
If you don't tell me
what the fuck's going on,


247
00:28:59.028 --> 00:29:01.130
then how the fuck
am I supposed to help you?


248
00:29:03.667 --> 00:29:06.302
You know Leor's company,
The Phoenix Group?


249
00:29:06.336 --> 00:29:07.270
Yeah.

250
00:29:08.304 --> 00:29:09.640
They do good work

251
00:29:09.673 --> 00:29:12.275
with the guys coming back
fucked up from the war.


252
00:29:13.943 --> 00:29:16.045
Limbs, spinal reconstruction...

253
00:29:18.348 --> 00:29:19.583
They do good work.

254
00:29:19.616 --> 00:29:22.018
I know all that, yeah.

255
00:29:22.051 --> 00:29:23.386
But go on.

256
00:29:27.924 --> 00:29:31.027
Taylor got Leor wrapped around his
finger talking about the future,


257
00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:35.064
telling him what could be
achieved with this technology.


258
00:29:37.601 --> 00:29:39.102
Yeah?

259
00:29:44.107 --> 00:29:45.975
I saw something last night.

260
00:29:50.513 --> 00:29:52.215
Something incredible.

261
00:30:27.216 --> 00:30:29.620
The bodies
are still here.


262
00:30:29.653 --> 00:30:31.387
The drugs, still here.

263
00:30:31.421 --> 00:30:33.189
The money's still here.

264
00:30:35.191 --> 00:30:37.260
This is almost pretty
incredible, man.


265
00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.015
Hey, hey, no, no, no.

266
00:30:59.048 --> 00:31:00.283
Sir, stop!

267
00:31:00.316 --> 00:31:01.451
Sir, what are you doing?

268
00:31:01.484 --> 00:31:03.052
Sir, that's not your food!

269
00:31:27.977 --> 00:31:29.613
What the fuck you doing?
Turn that back on.


270
00:31:29.646 --> 00:31:31.615
You gotta be
fucking kidding me, man.


271
00:31:31.648 --> 00:31:34.183
- Put it back on.
- No, man.


272
00:31:34.217 --> 00:31:36.486
It's been fucking
over a year, man.


273
00:31:36.519 --> 00:31:39.155
Get her damn out
of your fucking head.


274
00:31:39.188 --> 00:31:41.424
Pretz, don't be an asshole.
Turn it back on.


275
00:31:41.457 --> 00:31:44.260
No, that's not gonna happen.
I'm not gonna turn it back on.


276
00:31:44.293 --> 00:31:46.562
Turn it back on before we both
do something we regret.


277
00:31:46.597 --> 00:31:50.333
Yeah. There's already
too many goddamn regrets.


278
00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:55.739
I guess this shit you take's got
you making bad decisions every day.


279
00:32:03.446 --> 00:32:05.181
- Ah, fuck.
- Yeah, hit me.


280
00:32:05.214 --> 00:32:06.617
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no, no.


281
00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.619
Hit me. No, no, no.
Hit-hit me again.


282
00:32:08.652 --> 00:32:09.820
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, hit me again.


283
00:32:09.853 --> 00:32:11.087
- I'm sorry.
- Hit me again.


284
00:32:14.557 --> 00:32:15.792
She was afraid, all right?

285
00:32:15.826 --> 00:32:17.393
She was afraid you
were gonna die, all right?


286
00:32:17.426 --> 00:32:18.795
And there was nothing
you could've done


287
00:32:18.829 --> 00:32:20.162
would've made her stay.

288
00:32:21.698 --> 00:32:23.634
You chose your path, right?

289
00:32:23.667 --> 00:32:27.604
You made yourself into
a bullet magnet for the OR.


290
00:32:27.638 --> 00:32:30.439
It's too fucking dangerous
to be around you, man.


291
00:32:30.473 --> 00:32:34.143
Accept that and get the fuck
on with your fucking life.


292
00:32:35.879 --> 00:32:37.814
And what if I don't
want to be that anymore?


293
00:32:37.848 --> 00:32:39.415
Well, fucking change.

294
00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:41.752
People change, bro.

295
00:32:43.654 --> 00:32:45.789
But you got to let
Michelle go.


296
00:32:47.557 --> 00:32:49.559
You got to move on, man.

297
00:32:53.529 --> 00:32:54.798
I don't know how.

298
00:32:58.334 --> 00:32:59.670
I know.

299
00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:02.405
Dang, come on.

300
00:33:02.438 --> 00:33:05.676
Listen, somehow it's gonna...
it's gonna work itself out.


301
00:33:05.709 --> 00:33:08.177
You know, you're gonna be
all right, right?


302
00:33:22.626 --> 00:33:23.559
Shall we?

303
00:33:24.661 --> 00:33:25.796
Let's go.

304
00:33:44.948 --> 00:33:47.183
Okay.
How you doing, okay?


305
00:33:47.216 --> 00:33:48.417
- Yeah.
- Okay.


306
00:33:48.451 --> 00:33:50.453
- Fine.
- What happened here?


307
00:33:50.486 --> 00:33:53.389
Um, big foreign guy, uh,

308
00:33:53.422 --> 00:33:55.524
started taking everybody's
food, eating it.


309
00:33:55.558 --> 00:33:56.793
- Ye... yeah.
- Yeah.


310
00:33:56.827 --> 00:33:58.327
Um, I don't know where...

311
00:33:58.361 --> 00:34:00.631
Which-which way
do you think he went?


312
00:34:00.664 --> 00:34:02.766
Uh, everyone told me
he went that way.


313
00:34:04.266 --> 00:34:07.236
- Knocked me out pretty bad.
- Yeah, all right.


314
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:08.605
Thank you. Thanks.

315
00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:09.572
Yeah.

316
00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:54.945
I'm here to help you.

317
00:35:59.649 --> 00:36:00.851
This is over.

318
00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:09.760
Cam!

319
00:36:15.899 --> 00:36:18.835
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

320
00:36:18.869 --> 00:36:21.071
Hang in there.
You're gonna be okay.


321
00:36:22.873 --> 00:36:27.510
- Help's coming. What?
- My back.


322
00:36:27.543 --> 00:36:29.478
I can't feel my legs.

323
00:36:30.747 --> 00:36:31.982
I can't feel my legs.

324
00:36:32.015 --> 00:36:34.017
Tell Michelle...

325
00:36:36.019 --> 00:36:37.888
Of course...
Rest easy.


326
00:36:37.921 --> 00:36:41.625
Michelle...

327
00:37:14.523 --> 00:37:15.926
<i>Chief,
what's going on?</i>


328
00:37:15.959 --> 00:37:17.894
<i>Where the fuck is everyone?</i>

329
00:37:22.132 --> 00:37:23.399
<i>Stay on mission.</i>

330
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.838
I appreciate you coming.

331
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:29.773
Ah... Cut the bullshit, Taylor.

332
00:37:29.806 --> 00:37:31.107
How much has Cam told you?

333
00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:32.809
He told me
you're still an asshole.


334
00:37:32.843 --> 00:37:35.078
You got my friend
killed, man.


335
00:37:36.445 --> 00:37:38.414
He's alive.

336
00:37:38.447 --> 00:37:40.684
- Technically.
- What do you mean?


337
00:37:40.717 --> 00:37:42.551
I don't know what the hell
you mean he's still alive.


338
00:37:42.586 --> 00:37:44.754
What I'm about to tell you
is top-secret,


339
00:37:44.788 --> 00:37:47.624
so you need to keep
your mouth shut.


340
00:37:47.657 --> 00:37:50.894
We're running
a very special program here.


341
00:37:50.927 --> 00:37:52.729
Using Teska's designs,

342
00:37:52.762 --> 00:37:57.834
we've developed a counteragent
using microscopic machines.


343
00:37:57.868 --> 00:38:00.402
Okay, then... This big guy...
the big guy then...


344
00:38:00.436 --> 00:38:02.571
What is he,
just a guinea pig or...?


345
00:38:02.606 --> 00:38:05.742
He was wounded, critically.

346
00:38:05.775 --> 00:38:09.746
Clinging to life, no
family, perfect prototype.


347
00:38:11.147 --> 00:38:13.850
- We saved his life.
- Yeah, convenient.


348
00:38:13.884 --> 00:38:15.785
So how do we stop him?

349
00:38:15.819 --> 00:38:18.688
It's a bit complicated.
Let me explain.


350
00:38:20.090 --> 00:38:24.961
Originally, we created
an antidote, a neutralizer,


351
00:38:24.995 --> 00:38:27.563
but it seems that
in the past 24 hours,


352
00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:30.200
we've seen that the micromachines
are able to convince


353
00:38:30.233 --> 00:38:33.803
the body's immune defense
to fight the antidote.


354
00:38:33.837 --> 00:38:37.807
So what happens, these machines?
They stay inside of them forever?


355
00:38:37.841 --> 00:38:39.075
Well, we're not sure.

356
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:43.847
We took samples from subject
Brock, and we're now seeing


357
00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:47.784
that this subject's cellular structure
and machine are becoming one.


358
00:38:47.817 --> 00:38:49.686
This will potentially
give the subject


359
00:38:49.719 --> 00:38:52.122
the effects indefinitely.

360
00:38:52.155 --> 00:38:53.590
Indefinitely.

361
00:38:53.623 --> 00:38:56.893
Okay, how do we kill him?

362
00:38:56.927 --> 00:38:59.996
We don't.
We don't want to damage him.


363
00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:04.868
We'd like to retrieve the subject and
figure out what went wrong, fix it.


364
00:39:04.901 --> 00:39:10.073
In retrospect, the subject Brock
is showing signs of stress.


365
00:39:10.106 --> 00:39:12.676
- You call that stress?
- Yes.


366
00:39:12.709 --> 00:39:15.145
Brought on by a massive amount
of shock and trauma.


367
00:39:15.178 --> 00:39:18.682
Something he probably endured
before this procedure.


368
00:39:18.715 --> 00:39:20.050
Although this situation

369
00:39:20.083 --> 00:39:21.785
could have exasperated
the issue,


370
00:39:21.818 --> 00:39:24.254
causing this delusional state.

371
00:39:24.287 --> 00:39:29.192
But I think that Brock
is still mentally in combat.


372
00:39:29.225 --> 00:39:33.229
I mean, this would not be
the same with everyone.


373
00:39:35.065 --> 00:39:37.233
Wait a second...

374
00:39:37.267 --> 00:39:39.202
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

375
00:39:39.235 --> 00:39:42.005
You're not... You're not
putting that shit into Cam.


376
00:39:42.038 --> 00:39:43.873
You want your friend
to live, right?


377
00:39:43.907 --> 00:39:46.242
I mean, really live.

378
00:39:46.276 --> 00:39:49.846
Not just frozen, because that's
exactly what he's going to be.


379
00:39:49.879 --> 00:39:52.115
Catatonic.

380
00:39:52.148 --> 00:39:57.020
He's had extensive damage
to spine, internal organs.


381
00:39:57.053 --> 00:40:00.890
The severity of his head
injuries alone, it's...


382
00:40:00.924 --> 00:40:03.760
You want him to live,
don't you?


383
00:40:03.793 --> 00:40:05.662
What do you think he'll say

384
00:40:05.695 --> 00:40:07.297
if we had the opportunity
to save him,


385
00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.735
make him walk,
and you tried to stop it?


386
00:40:11.768 --> 00:40:13.269
Putting Cam
through this procedure


387
00:40:13.303 --> 00:40:15.537
may be our only hope
in stopping Brock.


388
00:40:16.873 --> 00:40:18.742
You see, I fucking knew it.

389
00:40:18.775 --> 00:40:21.011
You guys are doing this
to save your fucking own asses.


390
00:40:21.044 --> 00:40:23.680
You don't give
a fuck about Cam.


391
00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:26.583
Question is, do you?

392
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:35.992
I don't know. What do you
think I should do, Mort?


393
00:40:36.026 --> 00:40:38.928
Geez, I don't know what to tell you.
How bad is it?


394
00:40:38.962 --> 00:40:41.598
He's fucked up, man.

395
00:40:46.036 --> 00:40:50.206
What do you think? You think...
You think I can trust Teska?


396
00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.709
Truth be told,
Teska is a little out there,


397
00:40:52.742 --> 00:40:56.312
but he's really trying to help the
whole world with this technology.


398
00:40:56.346 --> 00:40:58.882
Now, Cam genuinely
loves this guy.


399
00:40:58.915 --> 00:41:01.584
He's risked his life for him
on multiple occasions.


400
00:41:01.618 --> 00:41:02.786
What more can I say than that?

401
00:41:02.819 --> 00:41:04.821
Can you put Teska on the phone?

402
00:41:07.357 --> 00:41:08.958
Let me check.

403
00:41:08.992 --> 00:41:11.261
- Leor!
- Yes, Trevor.


404
00:41:11.294 --> 00:41:14.330
I've got Cam's partner
in Thailand on the phone, Pretz.


405
00:41:14.364 --> 00:41:17.834
- Says he needs to talk to you.
- Well, come in.


406
00:41:19.936 --> 00:41:21.237
Come on, then.

407
00:41:25.975 --> 00:41:27.377
What's happened?
Where's Cam?


408
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:30.914
So, we were trying to...
take down the guy,


409
00:41:30.947 --> 00:41:33.116
you know, the-the big guy,
you know, Brock.


410
00:41:33.149 --> 00:41:35.685
<i>He beat the hell out of Cam.</i>

411
00:41:35.718 --> 00:41:37.821
<i>Threw him off from really high</i>

412
00:41:37.854 --> 00:41:39.789
onto concrete and...

413
00:41:41.124 --> 00:41:42.859
How can I help?

414
00:41:42.892 --> 00:41:45.261
This doctor and, um...

415
00:41:45.295 --> 00:41:47.997
and Colonel Taylor, now-now...

416
00:41:48.031 --> 00:41:49.933
They wanna... they wanna
shoot him up with this, like...


417
00:41:49.966 --> 00:41:51.634
<i>you know,
like a nanotech shit.</i>


418
00:41:52.969 --> 00:41:55.905
- But...
- But what?


419
00:41:55.939 --> 00:41:58.775
Look what happened to
this guy Brock, okay?


420
00:41:58.808 --> 00:42:02.112
How do I know
the same won't happen to Cam?


421
00:42:02.145 --> 00:42:04.881
Truth is, we don't know.

422
00:42:04.914 --> 00:42:07.984
I've had more failures
than successes in this life,


423
00:42:08.017 --> 00:42:11.421
but if you're not failing,
you're not innovating.


424
00:42:11.454 --> 00:42:14.324
What I can tell you is,
with all my heart,


425
00:42:14.357 --> 00:42:18.261
I care about the people closest to
me, and that includes Cam.


426
00:42:18.294 --> 00:42:20.396
Why do you even mess with
this military bullshit?


427
00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.032
Yes, military tech
is a gray area.


428
00:42:24.134 --> 00:42:27.337
But what if my advancements
can help the military,


429
00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:31.274
the police,
firefighters do their jobs?


430
00:42:31.307 --> 00:42:34.911
Protect us
without the fear of death?


431
00:42:34.944 --> 00:42:36.179
Isn't that a good thing?

432
00:42:36.212 --> 00:42:41.151
And what if this technology
gets into the wrong hands, huh?


433
00:42:41.184 --> 00:42:46.823
What, like guns and bombs?

434
00:42:46.856 --> 00:42:49.292
Anything is dangerous
in the wrong hands.


435
00:42:49.325 --> 00:42:53.062
A.I. is next
and there's no stopping that.


436
00:42:54.964 --> 00:42:56.166
Listen...

437
00:42:58.001 --> 00:43:00.170
If Cam really is
in such bad condition,


438
00:43:01.871 --> 00:43:04.040
we may be
the only option he has.


439
00:43:05.208 --> 00:43:07.377
Okay, all right.

440
00:43:08.978 --> 00:43:10.446
Thank you.

441
00:43:16.186 --> 00:43:18.821
I like the Phoenix.

442
00:43:55.458 --> 00:43:57.060
Leave me alone.

443
00:44:19.983 --> 00:44:22.919
<i>We were
able to successfully fuse</i>


444
00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:27.223
<i>a Phoenix biotech arm
that actually functions now</i>


445
00:44:27.257 --> 00:44:30.026
<i>by use of Roger's
central nervous system.</i>


446
00:44:30.059 --> 00:44:33.396
<i>This technology isn't just
for military application,</i>


447
00:44:33.429 --> 00:44:36.232
<i>it's also for civilians
of all walks of life.</i>


448
00:44:36.266 --> 00:44:38.167
You're actually
watching this shit?


449
00:44:38.201 --> 00:44:39.535
Fuck, Cam.

450
00:44:44.974 --> 00:44:47.076
You're awake, man.

451
00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:48.311
You're awake.

452
00:44:49.979 --> 00:44:51.247
Yeah, you covered that.

453
00:44:55.885 --> 00:44:58.321
You-you've been asleep
a long time, man.


454
00:44:58.354 --> 00:45:01.224
We didn't think you were
going to make it, you know?


455
00:45:01.257 --> 00:45:03.293
What happened?

456
00:45:03.326 --> 00:45:04.894
I can't remember.

457
00:45:06.362 --> 00:45:08.998
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.


458
00:45:14.404 --> 00:45:16.873
- I was hurt.
- Yeah.


459
00:45:19.008 --> 00:45:20.343
My legs.

460
00:45:23.647 --> 00:45:25.281
I can feel my legs.

461
00:45:28.384 --> 00:45:30.353
As you may have
guessed, young man,


462
00:45:30.386 --> 00:45:31.888
you've been out for a while.

463
00:45:31.921 --> 00:45:34.991
- How do you feel?
- Hungry.


464
00:45:35.024 --> 00:45:37.126
Well, that's understandable.

465
00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.128
- When can I get up?
- No, no, no.


466
00:45:39.162 --> 00:45:41.331
We need the sedatives
to wear off a little.


467
00:45:41.364 --> 00:45:43.866
You should be able to move
around whenever you like.


468
00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.435
Do you have
any other questions?


469
00:45:47.303 --> 00:45:49.372
- Yeah, when's dinner?
- A nurse will bring you


470
00:45:49.405 --> 00:45:52.475
something in a little bit.
Nice to see you again.


471
00:45:59.982 --> 00:46:02.418
I gotta talk to Michelle.

472
00:46:02.452 --> 00:46:04.954
Ah, Cam, come on.

473
00:46:04.987 --> 00:46:07.890
- She-she-she doesn't...
- Doesn't what?


474
00:46:10.493 --> 00:46:12.061
Doesn't love me?

475
00:46:12.862 --> 00:46:14.964
- Bullshit.
- Maybe you're right.


476
00:46:14.997 --> 00:46:18.635
You know, maybe...
maybe you should talk to her.


477
00:46:18.669 --> 00:46:23.473
Maybe you should tell her
yourself, you know?


478
00:46:28.144 --> 00:46:31.381
Hey, thanks for being there for
me, bro.


479
00:46:34.283 --> 00:46:36.986
Any time, man.
Any time.


480
00:46:39.322 --> 00:46:42.058
Get me the fuck out of here
before that doctor comes back in.


481
00:47:00.711 --> 00:47:02.613
What do you want?

482
00:47:02.646 --> 00:47:04.213
Give me all the fish.

483
00:47:05.481 --> 00:47:07.450
Give me your money.

484
00:47:09.051 --> 00:47:11.487
Hey, hey.

485
00:47:28.672 --> 00:47:30.173
Oh, hey...

486
00:47:31.642 --> 00:47:33.644
Call me if you
ever need anything, all right?


487
00:47:33.677 --> 00:47:34.611
Yeah.

488
00:47:37.413 --> 00:47:38.682
Asshole.

489
00:48:12.315 --> 00:48:13.650
Cam?

490
00:48:13.684 --> 00:48:15.384
It's good to see you.

491
00:48:16.486 --> 00:48:17.987
You mind if I come in?

492
00:48:19.489 --> 00:48:20.691
I don't think
it's a good idea.


493
00:48:20.724 --> 00:48:22.793
Please.

494
00:48:22.826 --> 00:48:24.728
I need to talk to you.

495
00:48:27.631 --> 00:48:30.266
All right, make it quick.

496
00:48:42.445 --> 00:48:44.280
Um, you want
anything to drink?


497
00:48:44.313 --> 00:48:47.183
I don't have any whiskey.
Is beer okay for you?


498
00:48:47.216 --> 00:48:48.284
Water's fine.

499
00:48:49.352 --> 00:48:50.587
Water?

500
00:48:50.621 --> 00:48:52.623
Since when you
start drinking water?


501
00:49:00.731 --> 00:49:03.032
Stop staring at my ass.

502
00:49:08.605 --> 00:49:10.039
Thanks.

503
00:49:13.476 --> 00:49:16.245
So, what do you
want to talk about?


504
00:49:16.279 --> 00:49:18.347
Is it about the divorce papers?

505
00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:23.587
Tell you the truth,
I didn't open the envelope.


506
00:49:25.521 --> 00:49:26.690
This can't be what you want.

507
00:49:27.824 --> 00:49:30.092
- Everything is done...
- No.


508
00:49:31.695 --> 00:49:34.330
Just listen to
what I have to say. Okay?


509
00:49:34.363 --> 00:49:35.766
Before you kick me out.

510
00:49:38.301 --> 00:49:40.269
Please, it's important.

511
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:43.139
I don't like
the sound of this.


512
00:49:46.275 --> 00:49:49.579
I'm back,
working in Asia again.


513
00:49:49.613 --> 00:49:51.414
I know.

514
00:49:51.447 --> 00:49:53.784
You've made
quite a name for yourself.


515
00:49:53.817 --> 00:49:57.253
Getting shot for...
What's his name? Leor?


516
00:49:57.286 --> 00:50:00.156
No, no.

517
00:50:01.792 --> 00:50:03.594
I thought about everything.

518
00:50:05.696 --> 00:50:11.500
My life, us, the past.

519
00:50:14.403 --> 00:50:16.138
I want things to be different.

520
00:50:16.172 --> 00:50:17.874
I want to be different.

521
00:50:19.943 --> 00:50:22.111
I want to be
different for you.


522
00:50:27.584 --> 00:50:31.588
Yeah? Why the sudden change?

523
00:50:31.622 --> 00:50:35.759
Why now, after I serve you
the divorce papers?


524
00:50:37.594 --> 00:50:39.596
It's been a year, Cam.

525
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.135
I guess I just
lost track of time.


526
00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:51.240
What you do is too dangerous.

527
00:50:51.273 --> 00:50:54.310
You make bad decisions.

528
00:50:54.343 --> 00:50:56.847
I want peace in my life.

529
00:50:59.883 --> 00:51:02.451
I almost didn't
make it this time.


530
00:51:12.361 --> 00:51:15.398
This is not the
first time you almost got killed.


531
00:51:17.968 --> 00:51:19.770
And I'm sure
it won't be the last.


532
00:51:19.803 --> 00:51:22.304
This is...
This is different.


533
00:51:25.976 --> 00:51:27.644
It scared me.

534
00:51:30.914 --> 00:51:32.515
I was afraid.

535
00:51:36.318 --> 00:51:38.320
I was afraid I'd lose you.

536
00:51:41.323 --> 00:51:43.794
I thought I wouldn't get the
chance to tell you how I feel.


537
00:51:46.596 --> 00:51:47.931
What are you trying to do?

538
00:51:53.737 --> 00:51:56.439
Just tell you
I still love you.


539
00:51:59.876 --> 00:52:02.411
I will always love you.

540
00:52:28.839 --> 00:52:31.007
I'm sorry you were hurt.

541
00:52:32.575 --> 00:52:34.911
I'm sorry for a lot of things.

542
00:52:37.379 --> 00:52:39.515
But I'm not sorry I left.

543
00:52:41.517 --> 00:52:43.653
This is the best
for both of us.


544
00:52:56.833 --> 00:52:58.702
It was good to see you,
Michelle.


545
00:54:19.816 --> 00:54:21.383
What'd you do to me?

546
00:54:22.418 --> 00:54:25.521
I assume you know
the penalty for trespassing?


547
00:54:25.554 --> 00:54:28.024
What the fuck
did you do to me?


548
00:54:28.058 --> 00:54:30.660
Relax.

549
00:54:30.694 --> 00:54:32.028
I know why you're here.

550
00:54:33.763 --> 00:54:35.799
Answer my question.

551
00:54:35.832 --> 00:54:37.167
What the fuck
did you do to me?


552
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.736
I saved your life.

553
00:54:39.769 --> 00:54:42.606
I gave you
a second chance at life.


554
00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:45.742
You put that shit in me.

555
00:54:47.711 --> 00:54:49.846
Well, you're the hero, right?

556
00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.447
- So go...
- I'm not your fucking hero.


557
00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.583
- So go be the hero.
- I'm not your fucking hero,


558
00:54:53.617 --> 00:54:55.886
and I'm not one of your
fucking soldiers anymore!


559
00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:01.825
You're right,

560
00:55:01.858 --> 00:55:05.494
but you're the only one that
can stop that thing right now.


561
00:55:08.064 --> 00:55:09.966
What?

562
00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.400
I'm thinking.

563
00:55:12.501 --> 00:55:13.770
About?

564
00:55:14.871 --> 00:55:17.674
About how I'm going to kick
your ass when all this is over.


565
00:55:56.947 --> 00:55:57.948
Did you know?

566
00:55:57.981 --> 00:55:59.883
Know what?

567
00:55:59.916 --> 00:56:02.719
Don't fucking play dumb with me.
Did you know?


568
00:56:02.752 --> 00:56:05.021
Did you know Taylor
pumped me full of that shit?


569
00:56:10.961 --> 00:56:12.062
Come here, come here.

570
00:56:19.169 --> 00:56:20.971
You were almost dead, bro.

571
00:56:21.004 --> 00:56:22.872
All right?
You were almost dead.


572
00:56:22.906 --> 00:56:23.873
Now, your spine was shattered.

573
00:56:23.907 --> 00:56:26.977
All right, there...
there was nothing I could do.


574
00:56:29.813 --> 00:56:31.181
It's all right.

575
00:56:32.282 --> 00:56:33.850
Just wanted to know
if you knew.


576
00:56:33.883 --> 00:56:37.687
You were dying.
I did not want to lose you.


577
00:56:39.689 --> 00:56:41.191
I would have done
the same thing for you.


578
00:56:43.159 --> 00:56:45.662
You fucking superhero.

579
00:56:45.695 --> 00:56:47.764
Yeah, you're a super asshole.
Get off of me.


580
00:56:55.839 --> 00:56:57.841
Something's going down
at the docks.


581
00:57:35.245 --> 00:57:37.347
I'm not sure yet.
Wait...


582
00:57:42.352 --> 00:57:44.821
Okay, he thinks it's...
He thinks it's Brock.


583
00:57:54.964 --> 00:57:56.833
- Give me a second.
- Yeah, okay.


584
00:58:01.304 --> 00:58:04.007
- Who's this?
- <i>Hey, it's me.</i>


585
00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:06.276
- Is this a bad time?
- <i>No.</i>


586
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:07.610
No. Not at all.

587
00:58:08.778 --> 00:58:11.147
Is this about the other night?

588
00:58:11.181 --> 00:58:13.750
No, I'm just ha...
having a situation here at work.


589
00:58:13.783 --> 00:58:15.285
<i>So you're not turning me down.</i>

590
00:58:15.318 --> 00:58:17.153
<i>Don't you change your mind?</i>

591
00:58:17.187 --> 00:58:18.688
Never.

592
00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:25.762
Uh... yeah, forget about...
forget about the other night.


593
00:58:25.795 --> 00:58:27.363
Maybe I can...

594
00:58:29.132 --> 00:58:31.067
Maybe I can come by later
and we can talk.


595
00:58:31.101 --> 00:58:33.203
Cam, I don't want you...

596
00:58:33.236 --> 00:58:35.772
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.


597
00:58:35.805 --> 00:58:37.774
- Just talk. I just wanna talk.
- <i>No. I don't...</i>


598
00:58:37.807 --> 00:58:41.111
- <i>I don't want you to think I'm...</i>
- No, I just want to talk.


599
00:58:41.144 --> 00:58:44.781
<i>All right,
I'll see you later. Bye.</i>


600
00:59:26.456 --> 00:59:28.358
Yo, Cam.

601
00:59:28.391 --> 00:59:29.859
How you feeling, man?

602
00:59:31.261 --> 00:59:32.996
- How do I feel?
- Yeah.


603
00:59:33.029 --> 00:59:36.132
- What are you thinking?
- What?


604
00:59:36.166 --> 00:59:38.067
- What are you thinking?
- What? Spit it out.


605
00:59:38.101 --> 00:59:41.971
Well, you think you're gonna
go crazy and shit like that?


606
00:59:46.342 --> 00:59:47.410
I hope not.

607
00:59:47.443 --> 00:59:48.945
This is fucked,
man.


608
00:59:48.978 --> 00:59:50.780
It's like trying to find
a needle in a haystack.


609
00:59:50.813 --> 00:59:53.883
Yeah, a big,
fucking angry needle.


610
00:59:53.917 --> 00:59:55.151
Let's go check over here.

611
01:00:28.518 --> 01:00:29.953
Are you okay?

612
01:00:29.986 --> 01:00:32.422
Oh, yes. Thank you.

613
01:00:45.468 --> 01:00:48.404
Put some lotion in the basket.

614
01:00:48.438 --> 01:00:50.139
You scared the hell out of me.

615
01:00:52.809 --> 01:00:55.144
- You got a car?
- Yeah, I got Pretz's truck.


616
01:00:55.178 --> 01:00:56.946
I didn't know if you
were gonna still be here,


617
01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:00.450
but you got a minute?
You wanna talk?


618
01:01:00.483 --> 01:01:03.219
- You stay at the hotel?
- Yeah.


619
01:01:04.287 --> 01:01:05.855
Okay.

620
01:01:11.094 --> 01:01:12.528
How was it tonight?

621
01:01:12.562 --> 01:01:14.264
- It was good.
- Good?


622
01:01:14.297 --> 01:01:17.166
- Yeah.
- A lot of people?


623
01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.836
Yeah, a lot of people.

624
01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:36.919
So, what you want
to talk about?


625
01:01:39.989 --> 01:01:42.091
First of all, I'm sorry
about the other night.


626
01:01:43.459 --> 01:01:45.995
I shouldn't have
acted like that.


627
01:01:47.363 --> 01:01:49.532
Just had a tough night.

628
01:01:49.565 --> 01:01:51.000
I like that side of you.

629
01:01:53.569 --> 01:01:55.471
Remember when we met?

630
01:01:56.539 --> 01:01:57.473
Yeah.

631
01:01:58.308 --> 01:02:02.045
When I was performing
at your big corporate party.


632
01:02:02.078 --> 01:02:04.247
Yeah.

633
01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:08.885
Well, the reason why Leor
was here in Thailand...


634
01:02:14.023 --> 01:02:17.527
There's a project
to help people heal.


635
01:02:18.561 --> 01:02:20.430
Just give me a second.

636
01:02:23.399 --> 01:02:24.400
Hello.

637
01:02:25.669 --> 01:02:27.203
Is everything okay?

638
01:02:28.571 --> 01:02:30.106
Michelle.

639
01:02:30.139 --> 01:02:32.208
Michelle,
just give me a second.


640
01:02:35.044 --> 01:02:36.045
No, it's fine.

641
01:04:22.051 --> 01:04:24.420
We've been all over and
haven't seen a goddamn thing.


642
01:04:26.590 --> 01:04:30.126
He'll be around here.
I know it.


643
01:04:30.159 --> 01:04:31.628
My feet would rather be
someplace else.


644
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:36.332
Maybe if you cleaned up,
you wouldn't feel like shit.


645
01:04:38.034 --> 01:04:39.469
Yeah, but...

646
01:04:39.502 --> 01:04:43.072
but I don't got the same juice running
through my veins the way you do, man.


647
01:04:58.287 --> 01:05:00.523
- It's him. Call it in.
- Right, right, right.


648
01:05:00.556 --> 01:05:01.692
Cam, wait!

649
01:06:27.844 --> 01:06:30.581
You shouldn't have come back.

650
01:07:03.379 --> 01:07:04.581
Let it go.

651
01:07:14.223 --> 01:07:15.324
I can't.

652
01:07:38.347 --> 01:07:39.650
You won't stop me.

653
01:07:48.491 --> 01:07:50.192
We don't have to do this.

654
01:07:51.427 --> 01:07:52.929
Come back with me.

655
01:07:52.963 --> 01:07:54.798
We can figure this out.

656
01:07:54.831 --> 01:07:56.900
There is nothing to figure out.

657
01:08:25.796 --> 01:08:27.496
What happened to you?

658
01:08:30.033 --> 01:08:32.769
You seemed
like a good soldier.


659
01:08:34.037 --> 01:08:35.972
Come back with me.

660
01:08:36.006 --> 01:08:37.674
They can fix you.

661
01:08:39.609 --> 01:08:41.011
It's too late.

662
01:09:06.937 --> 01:09:08.972
Hey, hey.

663
01:09:10.774 --> 01:09:12.241
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Get off of me.


664
01:09:13.610 --> 01:09:15.812
- Where did he go?
- He's gone.


665
01:09:18.582 --> 01:09:21.417
What happened
with the gunshot victims?


666
01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:22.652
They didn't make it.

667
01:09:25.756 --> 01:09:26.957
Hold on a second.

668
01:09:28.457 --> 01:09:30.359
You've been shot, man.

669
01:09:30.392 --> 01:09:31.928
This shit really works.

670
01:09:32.929 --> 01:09:35.297
Maybe you should see
a doctor, huh?


671
01:10:00.757 --> 01:10:01.858
Everything's normal.

672
01:10:01.892 --> 01:10:05.361
Your body is adapting to
the nanotech very well.


673
01:10:10.867 --> 01:10:13.469
Okay, so, um...

674
01:10:13.502 --> 01:10:16.606
so, is he gonna be
like this forever?


675
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.843
He may need some booster shots
to keep at peak performance,


676
01:10:19.876 --> 01:10:21.978
but as far as we can tell
at this point,


677
01:10:22.012 --> 01:10:24.781
um, he's gonna remain
like this indefinitely.


678
01:10:28.885 --> 01:10:30.620
Indefinitely.

679
01:10:32.155 --> 01:10:33.190
Sounds horrible.

680
01:10:33.223 --> 01:10:37.127
Well, there is one thing
to avoid for sure: fire.


681
01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:41.765
If the tissue has burned away,
say, 40% or more,


682
01:10:41.798 --> 01:10:43.967
then there isn't enough
to rebuild from.


683
01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.535
It worked with test monkeys.

684
01:13:20.957 --> 01:13:21.891
Cam.

685
01:13:25.195 --> 01:13:27.030
Cam, Cam!

686
01:13:28.965 --> 01:13:30.233
Cam!

687
01:13:33.737 --> 01:13:34.938
- Cam...
- What is it?


688
01:13:34.971 --> 01:13:38.174
We've gotta get
to the lab, man.


689
01:13:38.208 --> 01:13:39.709
It's serious.

690
01:13:41.111 --> 01:13:42.846
All right, give me a minute,
I'll get dressed.


691
01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:52.055
Hey.

692
01:13:53.123 --> 01:13:54.124
Hey, Cortez.

693
01:13:56.126 --> 01:13:58.061
Did Taylor tell you
what I did?


694
01:13:59.729 --> 01:14:01.031
You here
to turn yourself in?


695
01:14:02.365 --> 01:14:04.768
I need more of that stuff.

696
01:14:04.801 --> 01:14:06.703
Where is it?

697
01:14:06.736 --> 01:14:08.238
It's...

698
01:14:08.271 --> 01:14:10.073
We keep it
in the test chambers.


699
01:14:10.106 --> 01:14:11.608
Walk.

700
01:14:13.376 --> 01:14:16.980
- I want the guns.
- Okay. Put them down.


701
01:14:22.285 --> 01:14:25.855
Come on, we both want
this project to succeed,


702
01:14:25.889 --> 01:14:29.025
for you to stay alive and for
me to see it come to fruition.


703
01:14:31.294 --> 01:14:34.264
You don't know what I want,
so give me the juice.


704
01:15:07.664 --> 01:15:08.765
Yeah.

705
01:15:08.798 --> 01:15:10.366
Colonel Taylor,
we're under attack.


706
01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.635
- Brock?
- Yes. It's him.


707
01:15:12.669 --> 01:15:16.806
- I'm 15 out.
- Get your ass over here and take care of it.


708
01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.874
Bitch.

709
01:16:13.496 --> 01:16:14.864
You came back.

710
01:16:20.203 --> 01:16:21.905
This is what you want?

711
01:16:25.808 --> 01:16:26.943
Shit.

712
01:16:29.946 --> 01:16:30.813
Hey, babe.

713
01:16:30.847 --> 01:16:34.050
Cam, I've called you
a couple of times.


714
01:16:34.083 --> 01:16:35.385
Why haven't you
answered the phone?


715
01:16:35.418 --> 01:16:37.220
Oh, I'm just having
a little issue at work.


716
01:16:37.253 --> 01:16:38.688
Can I call you back?

717
01:16:40.957 --> 01:16:44.160
<i>I'm just... I'm performing
at Club Red tonight</i>


718
01:16:44.194 --> 01:16:46.396
<i>and you haven't seen me
sing in a while,</i>


719
01:16:46.429 --> 01:16:48.865
<i>so I thought you
might want to come and watch.</i>


720
01:16:48.898 --> 01:16:50.733
Yeah, okay.
I... I'll call you back.


721
01:16:51.935 --> 01:16:53.102
You won't stop me.

722
01:16:56.172 --> 01:16:57.140
Now!

723
01:17:31.507 --> 01:17:32.842
You piece of shit.

724
01:17:33.843 --> 01:17:35.445
- What?
- You set him up.


725
01:17:35.478 --> 01:17:37.380
Him and his men.

726
01:17:37.413 --> 01:17:39.249
Fucking mission
was bullshit.


727
01:17:39.282 --> 01:17:42.151
- There were no hostages.
- That's classified information.


728
01:17:42.185 --> 01:17:43.519
You don't know
what you're doing.


729
01:17:43.553 --> 01:17:45.188
He didn't volunteer.

730
01:17:46.289 --> 01:17:47.523
You set him up.

731
01:17:47.557 --> 01:17:50.927
You sent that poor bastard
into an ambush.


732
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.463
You picked up the pieces
and made a fucking monster.


733
01:17:55.431 --> 01:17:57.433
And now you're one too.

734
01:19:25.421 --> 01:19:26.356
No!

735
01:19:28.257 --> 01:19:29.325
No!

736
01:19:29.359 --> 01:19:32.895
No! No, don't!

737
01:19:36.366 --> 01:19:38.034
No!

738
01:19:38.067 --> 01:19:39.035
No!

739
01:19:47.477 --> 01:19:50.146
- <i>Hello, this is Michelle...</i>
- Motherfuck.


740
01:19:50.179 --> 01:19:51.948
- What?
- Straight to voicemail.


741
01:19:51.981 --> 01:19:54.250
- Maybe she's on stage, huh?
- No.


742
01:19:54.283 --> 01:19:56.386
I got a bad feeling.
Just go to the club.


743
01:20:28.985 --> 01:20:30.520
- What's he saying?
- A lot of people got hurt,


744
01:20:30.553 --> 01:20:31.688
a lot of people
got injured and...


745
01:20:33.122 --> 01:20:34.658
the singer got taken,
all right?


746
01:20:34.691 --> 01:20:37.260
Singer, female?

747
01:20:37.293 --> 01:20:38.327
- Female singer?
- Yeah.


748
01:20:38.361 --> 01:20:39.495
Okay.

749
01:20:39.529 --> 01:20:41.264
It's Michelle.

750
01:20:57.547 --> 01:20:58.582
Let me go.

751
01:20:59.583 --> 01:21:01.150
Untie me.

752
01:21:05.054 --> 01:21:06.489
Don't worry.

753
01:21:06.522 --> 01:21:08.991
I just need you
until I get what I need.


754
01:21:12.596 --> 01:21:15.097
Wait until Cam
gets ahold of you.


755
01:21:29.111 --> 01:21:31.648
- <i>Michelle...</i>
- It's me.


756
01:21:33.382 --> 01:21:34.718
Well, you're dead,
motherfucker.


757
01:21:34.751 --> 01:21:36.486
You hear me?

758
01:21:36.519 --> 01:21:38.020
<i>You crossed the line.</i>

759
01:21:38.054 --> 01:21:40.156
You took my girl,
I tried to fucking help you.


760
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:43.694
I won't hurt her
if you do what I say.


761
01:21:43.727 --> 01:21:46.229
Riverwalk building by the docks.
Twenty minutes.


762
01:21:47.731 --> 01:21:49.499
Okay, so what's the plan?

763
01:21:52.134 --> 01:21:53.637
Save Michelle.

764
01:21:58.609 --> 01:22:00.510
Just in case.

765
01:22:00.543 --> 01:22:02.512
Should we call for back-up?

766
01:22:02.545 --> 01:22:06.549
No. No one else
needs to die.


767
01:22:06.583 --> 01:22:08.150
Just me and him.

768
01:22:20.096 --> 01:22:21.397
Cam!

769
01:22:41.484 --> 01:22:42.552
Cam.

770
01:22:47.858 --> 01:22:49.125
You okay?

771
01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:52.328
Do you have it?

772
01:22:59.435 --> 01:23:00.637
Right here.

773
01:23:04.140 --> 01:23:05.575
All you gotta do
is let her go.


774
01:23:06.743 --> 01:23:08.077
Give them to me.

775
01:23:10.212 --> 01:23:11.715
Give me them,
I'll let her go.


776
01:23:11.748 --> 01:23:13.750
They're right here.

777
01:23:14.885 --> 01:23:16.753
All you gotta do
is let her go.


778
01:23:16.787 --> 01:23:18.521
We had a deal.

779
01:23:25.596 --> 01:23:28.197
Run. Go now.

780
01:23:34.170 --> 01:23:35.538
Just you and me now.

781
01:23:36.539 --> 01:23:37.741
That's right.

782
01:24:53.549 --> 01:24:55.585
You okay?

783
01:24:55.619 --> 01:24:57.486
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm okay.


784
01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:59.221
- Cam is on the top, go help him.
- Okay.


785
01:25:35.592 --> 01:25:37.594
Give me the fucking vial.

786
01:25:41.330 --> 01:25:43.466
Give me the fucking vial.

787
01:25:46.737 --> 01:25:47.671
No!

788
01:26:06.489 --> 01:26:09.993
- You'll kill us both.
- Maybe it's better that way.


789
01:26:17.734 --> 01:26:18.835
Why?

790
01:26:22.672 --> 01:26:23.740
Why did you do it?

791
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:29.045
Why?

792
01:26:29.079 --> 01:26:30.714
My men!

793
01:26:34.383 --> 01:26:36.887
Some of my men are still alive.

794
01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:39.656
I have to go back
and save my men.


795
01:26:39.689 --> 01:26:42.058
I have to go back
and save them.


796
01:26:45.061 --> 01:26:47.597
I have a boat, supplies.

797
01:26:47.631 --> 01:26:50.901
I just need the juice so I can
have the power to save my men.


798
01:26:54.037 --> 01:26:55.538
Help me save my men.

799
01:26:55.571 --> 01:26:56.973
It's over.

800
01:27:06.515 --> 01:27:07.617
It's over.

801
01:27:20.563 --> 01:27:21.731
Cam!

802
01:27:22.999 --> 01:27:25.135
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.


803
01:27:25.168 --> 01:27:26.535
- You okay?
- Yeah.


804
01:27:26.569 --> 01:27:28.905
- He didn't hurt you, did he?
- No.


805
01:27:30.573 --> 01:27:34.443
You know, Brock's guys
still might be out there.


806
01:27:35.879 --> 01:27:36.947
Yeah, I know.

807
01:27:43.452 --> 01:27:45.454
You know we can't
let that slide, huh?


808
01:28:16.452 --> 01:28:19.055
So, um, what is it
that you wanted to tell me?


809
01:28:22.092 --> 01:28:24.794
Yeah, so I'm...

810
01:28:32.606 --> 01:28:37.606
