00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.345
- Smash!
- Smash! Smash!


2
00:05:04.386 --> 00:05:07.287
- Hey.
- Hey.


3
00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:15.289
Ok. So, I was thinking, if
I'm like, a little bit left


4
00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:18.031
of center and then
you're on my right.


5
00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:20.234
I'm on the left.

6
00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.903
No, that's my
right, if you're looking


7
00:05:22.905 --> 00:05:27.674
at it this way. And
you're just a little bit back.


8
00:05:27.676 --> 00:05:30.377
Ok. I get it.

9
00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:37.651
Tyler, get those
off! Get out! Out! Mom!


10
00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:41.555
Tyler, out of your sisters room.

11
00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:45.425
Oh! I am so going to cut that
little tongue of yours.


12
00:05:45.427 --> 00:05:48.562
Laura, I just got
called into work,


13
00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:51.164
I really need
you to watch Tyler.


14
00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:53.834
Laura.

15
00:05:53.836 --> 00:05:55.903
Yeah, whatever I'll watch him.

16
00:05:57.072 --> 00:06:00.607
Ok. Thank you. I'm going out
with Ken after so I might


17
00:06:00.609 --> 00:06:05.045
be kinda' late. So you'll have
to put him to bed. Sorry Carly,


18
00:06:05.047 --> 00:06:08.882
I don't have anything
to feed you for dinner.


19
00:06:08.884 --> 00:06:12.386
Oh that's okay Lisa, I'm not
hungry anyway but is it okay


20
00:06:12.388 --> 00:06:15.188
if I stay over though?
I can help watch Tyler.


21
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.425
Yeah fine.
Thank you baby.


22
00:06:21.463 --> 00:06:23.697
Who's Ken?

23
00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:25.933
Ugh! He's the
worst, he's always drunk


24
00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:30.404
and they fight all the time.
I'm sure it won't last.


25
00:06:30.406 --> 00:06:33.807
Ew. That sucks.

26
00:06:37.079 --> 00:06:40.213
Yeah, she's pretty annoying.
She's always around Jason.


27
00:06:40.215 --> 00:06:45.619
It's obvious she has a
crush on him but I don't care.


28
00:06:45.621 --> 00:06:47.955
Really?

29
00:06:47.957 --> 00:06:52.726
Yeah I don't care
about Jason, we just fuck


30
00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:57.831
sometimes. I don't know,
I guess he's my boyfriend.


31
00:06:57.833 --> 00:07:00.500
I don't really have a
crush on anyone else.


32
00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:06.473
Well, I think
Jason is pretty cute.


33
00:07:06.475 --> 00:07:10.177
Yeah, he's ok I guess. All
the guys in our school are


34
00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:17.851
immature. Girls actually
mature faster then guys,


35
00:07:17.853 --> 00:07:22.456
technically we should be going
out with guys older than us.


36
00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:27.294
Mother Fucker!
Actually, wasn't that bad.


37
00:07:29.698 --> 00:07:32.833
Tyler!
What happened?


38
00:07:37.006 --> 00:07:39.039
I scraped my knee.

39
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:43.510
Well, get a band-aid and close
the door. You are so annoying.


40
00:07:49.485 --> 00:07:52.285
Your turn!

41
00:08:05.134 --> 00:08:08.301
Hey.

42
00:08:08.303 --> 00:08:10.303
Hey, wanna hit the
maintenance shed?


43
00:08:10.305 --> 00:08:13.607
Yeah.

44
00:08:20.149 --> 00:08:24.684
What? I thought
you had a joint.


45
00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:29.589
You're such an idiot.

46
00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:33.560
No, I'm not.
Want some?


47
00:08:33.562 --> 00:08:37.864
I don't wanna inhale that shit.
It doesn't even get you high.


48
00:08:37.866 --> 00:08:39.866
Do you have weed or not?

49
00:08:39.868 --> 00:08:44.171
Try it, if you do enough it can
get you super fucked up.


50
00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:10.664
What.

51
00:09:17.206 --> 00:09:21.541
Put your mouth on
this for a second?


52
00:09:21.543 --> 00:09:24.911
I can't, my mouth is dry.

53
00:09:24.913 --> 00:09:26.273
Babe, you're so
good at it though.


54
00:09:26.448 --> 00:09:28.215
Thanks.

55
00:09:28.884 --> 00:09:29.950
Oh, this works too.

56
00:09:34.923 --> 00:09:40.160
I swear to god there
was a woman there.


57
00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:42.229
I swear to god.

58
00:09:58.614 --> 00:10:01.481
I seriously can't
get over that women.


59
00:10:01.483 --> 00:10:04.584
- What women?
- In the corner.


60
00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:06.987
- You're fucking high.
- She was there.


61
00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:10.757
No you're fucking high.

62
00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:15.862
Laura. How are
you? I missed you.


63
00:10:15.864 --> 00:10:20.100
Dog face but
I'd still do her from behind.


64
00:10:20.102 --> 00:10:22.769
Fuck you Matt,
you're no fucking prize.


65
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:25.272
Hey Matty! Speaking
of dog faces your sister


66
00:10:25.274 --> 00:10:27.807
let me cum in
her ass last night.


67
00:10:30.612 --> 00:10:32.612
Ok, I gotta bounce.

68
00:10:32.614 --> 00:10:35.815
See ya. Okay, let's get back
before the start of history.


69
00:10:35.817 --> 00:10:39.886
What? Schools
done, you missed history.


70
00:10:39.888 --> 00:10:42.889
What? How
long was I in there?


71
00:10:42.891 --> 00:10:44.958
I don't know.

72
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.061
Seriously I
think I had a test today.


73
00:10:48.063 --> 00:10:50.830
You need to take
more responsibility.


74
00:10:50.832 --> 00:10:52.832
Shit.

75
00:10:52.834 --> 00:10:56.236
You kind of smell
like lavender. It's nice.


76
00:11:04.213 --> 00:11:08.715
So, does that stuff
gives you a hangover?


77
00:11:08.717 --> 00:11:16.717
No, it wore off pretty quick.
What about Pineapple girls?


78
00:11:17.492 --> 00:11:22.028
Ok, you never like
the names I come up with!


79
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.031
Because... We
actually have to practice.


80
00:11:25.033 --> 00:11:30.904
What about Burnt
Girls? Burnt Devils?


81
00:11:30.906 --> 00:11:34.341
That sounds like a hockey team.

82
00:11:39.047 --> 00:11:40.163
Burnt Angels?

83
00:11:40.164 --> 00:11:41.280
- I was going to say that.
- Yeah?


84
00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:46.686
Yeah. Burnt Angel.
Like just Angel.


85
00:11:46.688 --> 00:11:48.788
- Burnt Angel.
- Burnt Angel.


86
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.258
- I like that.
- I like that too.


87
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.997
Sweet. Now we have to figure
out like stage props and stuff.


88
00:11:57.933 --> 00:12:02.269
So obviously some angel wings.

89
00:12:02.271 --> 00:12:05.772
Some fake
flowers. Like a banner,


90
00:12:05.774 --> 00:12:09.743
a big banner
behind us, Burnt Angel.


91
00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:13.613
Any luck finding a bass?

92
00:12:13.615 --> 00:12:16.750
Nothing my mom can
afford. I hope she gets


93
00:12:16.752 --> 00:12:19.719
me one for my birthday.

94
00:12:21.657 --> 00:12:25.959
I forgot to tell you, that my
Dad might be getting me an amp.


95
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:27.961
- What?
- Yeah.


96
00:12:27.963 --> 00:12:30.063
Like a guitar amp.

97
00:12:30.065 --> 00:12:33.433
Yeah. His friend is selling one
and we're going to go check


98
00:12:33.435 --> 00:12:35.935
it out tomorrow.
Did you want to come?


99
00:12:35.937 --> 00:12:38.738
Yeah, I would love to.

100
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:41.675
I don't know how you
didn't tell me this sooner.


101
00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:48.815
We're going to be
so good. Burnt Angel.


102
00:12:51.019 --> 00:12:55.255
It even looks cool.
Right? Like on a banner.


103
00:12:55.257 --> 00:13:00.727
Too bad we don't have any songs.

104
00:13:03.965 --> 00:13:08.101
I think it'll
really pump up the noise.


105
00:13:08.103 --> 00:13:11.204
And honestly, it
might be to loud for us.


106
00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:14.507
Cause it's pretty loud isn't it?

107
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:18.778
You don't need to like it. You
gotta do what you gotta do.


108
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.449
Hey, can I have a dart Carly?

109
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:26.386
Thank you. I'll get
you back, I promise.


110
00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:28.588
Yeah ok, Jay.

111
00:13:37.866 --> 00:13:42.969
Look, do you want to do me a
favor, girl. I got a few things


112
00:13:42.971 --> 00:13:47.707
I need to get rid of.
Can you pawn this for me?


113
00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:51.010
There's a pack
of smokes in it for ya.


114
00:13:51.012 --> 00:13:53.246
Jay, that shit is stolen?

115
00:13:53.248 --> 00:13:56.416
It's not stolen, the guys in
there, they know who I am


116
00:13:56.418 --> 00:13:58.485
and they just don't
trust me that's it.


117
00:13:58.487 --> 00:14:03.223
But I promise you this shit
right here? No. Not stolen.


118
00:14:03.225 --> 00:14:08.027
- I dunno.
- It'll only take a second.


119
00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:15.602
2 packs. If I get in
trouble for this shit


120
00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:17.837
I'm ratting you out.

121
00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:20.273
Thank you Carly.

122
00:14:35.891 --> 00:14:38.291
- Hey.
- Hello.


123
00:14:38.293 --> 00:14:40.727
How are you?

124
00:14:40.729 --> 00:14:43.463
Good. This is Carly, I
was telling you about her.


125
00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:46.699
She's the singer of the band.

126
00:14:46.701 --> 00:14:49.936
Hey. What's
different? Got hair cut?


127
00:14:49.938 --> 00:14:52.939
Ears pierced. You
got a new TV, it's big!


128
00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:54.941
Do you have satellite?

129
00:14:54.943 --> 00:14:57.243
You got your ears
pierced. I like 'em.


130
00:14:57.245 --> 00:14:59.779
Oh, you don't have to take
your shoes off we are going


131
00:14:59.781 --> 00:15:02.215
to leave now go
look at that amp.


132
00:15:02.217 --> 00:15:08.655
Okay, thanks for this, Laura's
Dad, we're pretty excited.


133
00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:12.325
Call me Wayne, and you're
welcome. You ready to go?


134
00:15:12.327 --> 00:15:14.894
We have to catch
him before he leaves.


135
00:15:14.896 --> 00:15:17.997
Yeah. I'm just going to
put my guitar downstairs.


136
00:15:17.999 --> 00:15:20.066
Alright.
Hurry up.


137
00:15:25.907 --> 00:15:28.107
You want some
water or something?


138
00:15:28.109 --> 00:15:31.778
I'm good.
Thanks.


139
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:35.148
You know my keys...

140
00:15:48.697 --> 00:15:52.098
Oh he's got this
whole basement too.


141
00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.734
Mmmm mmm.

142
00:16:01.643 --> 00:16:04.377
Alright plug her in.

143
00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:15.522
- Oh my God, that sounds amazing.
- That sounds really good.


144
00:16:15.524 --> 00:16:18.391
You girls want BLTs for dinner?

145
00:16:18.393 --> 00:16:20.560
Sure, yeah.

146
00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:22.729
Your Dad seems pretty cool.

147
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.732
Yeah, he's cool.

148
00:16:27.802 --> 00:16:29.802
Why don't you live here then?

149
00:16:29.804 --> 00:16:33.873
Mom would never let
me. Tyler's dad barely pays


150
00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:40.480
child support, so she sort
of needs me there I guess.


151
00:16:40.482 --> 00:16:44.017
Were they married?
Wayne and your mom?


152
00:16:44.019 --> 00:16:46.753
Nah, it was
just a fling I think.


153
00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:50.757
He's actually had issues
with drugs in the past.


154
00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:55.895
- Really?
- Oh it has base and trouble.


155
00:16:55.897 --> 00:16:59.532
Here let me see.

156
00:16:59.534 --> 00:17:03.770
- Overdrive.
- Overdrive.


157
00:17:06.341 --> 00:17:09.108
I'm just going
to crank the amp up.


158
00:17:11.279 --> 00:17:13.580
- Yes.
- That's pretty rad.


159
00:17:13.582 --> 00:17:18.918
That's even better. I
would keep it to a solid ten.


160
00:17:20.855 --> 00:17:23.222
That's pretty cool
that he stuck aroud when


161
00:17:23.224 --> 00:17:25.224
your mom was pregnant.

162
00:17:25.226 --> 00:17:27.894
Yeah, he's a good
guy. He even asked her to


163
00:17:27.896 --> 00:17:31.864
marry him because he thought it
was the "right" thing to do...


164
00:17:31.866 --> 00:17:36.102
but I guess she wasn't thrilled
with his drug use back then.


165
00:17:36.104 --> 00:17:39.272
Like the guys she
dates now are any better!


166
00:17:43.878 --> 00:17:45.878
Thanks again
Dad. This was awesome.


167
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.880
No problem. And
you're coming here


168
00:17:47.882 --> 00:17:49.882
to stay next weekend right?

169
00:17:49.884 --> 00:17:51.884
Yup, I have to watch
Tyler this weekend, but Mom


170
00:17:51.886 --> 00:17:54.487
said I can come here next
weekend righ after school.


171
00:17:54.489 --> 00:17:58.257
Great! It was
nice meeting you Carly.


172
00:17:58.259 --> 00:18:00.860
Yeah.
You too.


173
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.968
It was nice meeting you Carly.

174
00:18:15.176 --> 00:18:21.080
We could do like echo room.

175
00:18:21.082 --> 00:18:23.583
Oh that would be so rad.
Ok well I'll see you tomorrow.


176
00:18:23.585 --> 00:18:26.019
Yeah, see you.

177
00:19:06.294 --> 00:19:08.795
We will be
discussing poetry next week.


178
00:19:08.797 --> 00:19:11.197
So if you have any poems
that you'd like to interpret


179
00:19:11.199 --> 00:19:13.733
please bring them in.
We also have lots of


180
00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:15.735
poetry books in the library.

181
00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:19.739
So no excuses! I
want everyone have a poem


182
00:19:19.741 --> 00:19:21.808
with them ready to interpreted.

183
00:19:26.981 --> 00:19:29.649
Miss Tanya. I'm
wondering if I could bring


184
00:19:29.651 --> 00:19:32.585
song lyrics instead of a poem?

185
00:19:32.587 --> 00:19:36.389
Oh, that's a great idea.
Well lyrics are poetry too.


186
00:19:36.391 --> 00:19:38.658
Are these lyrics
ones that you wrote?


187
00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:44.163
Oh, no I was going to
bring in some Nirvana lyrics.


188
00:19:44.165 --> 00:19:48.000
Oh! I thought I heard you say
you were doing some writting?


189
00:19:48.002 --> 00:19:51.270
Yeah. No, I'm in a band. But
our songs are not quite ready


190
00:19:51.272 --> 00:19:53.272
to show people yet.

191
00:19:53.274 --> 00:19:56.109
Well, that's okay.
Definitely bring them in and


192
00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:59.946
we will discuss it the way we
would any other poem.


193
00:19:59.948 --> 00:20:03.116
And I'd love to see
your band play some time.


194
00:20:06.221 --> 00:20:08.921
Thanks Miss Tanya.

195
00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:26.572
Hey, so I think we should
work on some music tonight.


196
00:20:26.574 --> 00:20:29.909
Yeah, we should. But
I'm going to my Dad's.


197
00:20:29.911 --> 00:20:34.547
Oh right, that's
tonight. I totally forgot.


198
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:37.116
Do you think he would
mind if we did it there?


199
00:20:37.118 --> 00:20:39.252
Yeah, I guess
that should be fine.


200
00:20:39.254 --> 00:20:42.555
Do we need to go
get your guitar first?


201
00:20:42.557 --> 00:20:45.925
No, he picked it up
from Mom's earlier.


202
00:20:45.927 --> 00:20:48.227
That was nice of him.

203
00:20:56.771 --> 00:20:59.005
So your mom said she
has a new boyfriend?


204
00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:04.644
Ken.
He's kind of shitty.


205
00:21:04.646 --> 00:21:07.280
Shitty how?

206
00:21:07.282 --> 00:21:09.816
Oh nothing he's just
like this kid you know.


207
00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:19.025
Can I help with anything?

208
00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:21.594
Oh no, I'm good.
You guys go downstairs


209
00:21:21.596 --> 00:21:23.830
and play music.

210
00:21:29.103 --> 00:21:36.142
- What you have here is good.
- Thanks.


211
00:21:36.144 --> 00:21:44.144
This one right here, you should
scream it for the chorus.


212
00:21:44.285 --> 00:21:52.285
Yeah.
Yeah, ok.


213
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:58.231
- Come on.
- Like right now?


214
00:21:58.233 --> 00:22:01.367
- Yeah.
- Your Dad is upstairs.


215
00:22:01.369 --> 00:22:04.403
What? How are we suppose
to be a real band if you can't


216
00:22:04.405 --> 00:22:08.174
even sing in front of one
person who isn't even


217
00:22:08.176 --> 00:22:10.409
in the same room as you?

218
00:22:10.411 --> 00:22:15.514
Ok. But not
right now, I'm winning.


219
00:24:00.588 --> 00:24:03.789
Oh, sorry I didn't
know you were out here.


220
00:24:03.791 --> 00:24:06.092
That's okay, are you alright?

221
00:24:06.094 --> 00:24:11.797
Oh yeah, I just came
out to sneak a cigarette.


222
00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:15.801
You want one?

223
00:24:15.803 --> 00:24:18.404
No.
I'm ok, thanks.


224
00:24:33.221 --> 00:24:35.554
So you plant those?

225
00:24:35.556 --> 00:24:38.824
Yeah, I don't have much of a
green thumb but I've always


226
00:24:38.826 --> 00:24:42.728
liked night gardens so I
thought I'd give it a shot.


227
00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:46.165
Spruce up the place.

228
00:24:46.167 --> 00:24:48.567
Night garden?

229
00:24:48.569 --> 00:24:51.670
Yeah, most flowers they
bloom during the day.


230
00:24:51.672 --> 00:24:59.672
These open up at night,
they're called moon flowers.


231
00:25:00.248 --> 00:25:05.851
What's a girl
gotta do to get one of those.


232
00:25:05.853 --> 00:25:09.088
That girl would have to
be og legal drinking age.


233
00:25:11.092 --> 00:25:17.596
I'm 18, I can vote. That should
be legal drinking age.


234
00:25:17.598 --> 00:25:22.101
You're in Laura's class?

235
00:25:22.103 --> 00:25:25.438
I got held back a couple times.

236
00:25:33.581 --> 00:25:36.916
Oh my God. Oh my
God, that's disgusting.


237
00:25:36.918 --> 00:25:40.753
It's near beer.
Non alcoholic.


238
00:25:40.755 --> 00:25:46.859
Well I didn't even have to
be of legal age to drink that!


239
00:25:46.861 --> 00:25:49.428
No seriously, that was terrible.

240
00:25:52.366 --> 00:25:54.266
Seriously..

241
00:25:58.239 --> 00:26:01.140
Mr. John found me
again. That asshole.


242
00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:04.944
I could have killed him. How
are we suppose to remember


243
00:26:04.946 --> 00:26:07.113
all those details.

244
00:26:07.115 --> 00:26:10.449
Come on. You won't need school
with a body like that, girl.


245
00:26:10.451 --> 00:26:15.387
I mean that
breath, what the fuck?


246
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:18.057
His wife died last
year, she probably


247
00:26:18.059 --> 00:26:22.161
killed herself.
I would have.


248
00:26:22.163 --> 00:26:25.498
- You want to?
- I don't know.


249
00:26:25.500 --> 00:26:27.500
You want to go at the shed?

250
00:26:27.502 --> 00:26:30.102
Nah, I can't. I got a make up
test this afternoon.


251
00:26:30.104 --> 00:26:35.007
- C'mon it will clear your head.
- Yeah ok.


252
00:26:43.584 --> 00:26:44.483
Come on Carly.

253
00:26:44.485 --> 00:26:46.152
No Jason. Fuck
off.


254
00:26:46.487 --> 00:26:47.553
What? Why not?

255
00:26:48.656 --> 00:26:49.722
Where is she?

256
00:26:51.659 --> 00:26:53.659
What?

257
00:26:53.661 --> 00:26:55.728
Come on. Why not?

258
00:26:56.631 --> 00:27:01.934
Cause I don't want to.

259
00:27:01.936 --> 00:27:05.171
Okay, okay, let's
go. I think you're done.


260
00:27:21.455 --> 00:27:29.361
This guy, Wayne. He's
my friend's Dad.


261
00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:55.354
Mom, Mom. Let me do
that. Go lay down ok.


262
00:27:55.356 --> 00:27:57.356
What do you want?
Grilled cheese?


263
00:27:57.358 --> 00:27:59.959
Yeah.

264
00:28:17.111 --> 00:28:22.114
Would you say Dad
was a "good guy" when


265
00:28:22.116 --> 00:28:24.116
he got you pregnant?

266
00:28:24.118 --> 00:28:27.253
As soon as he
got me pregnant he split.


267
00:28:27.255 --> 00:28:30.389
Landed himself in
prison. You know that.


268
00:28:30.391 --> 00:28:34.360
But he wasn't trying to
leave right? He was trying


269
00:28:34.362 --> 00:28:40.599
to be a good guy?

270
00:28:40.601 --> 00:28:44.103
He said he was getting me money
for the baby but his friend


271
00:28:44.105 --> 00:28:48.274
got caught and ratted him out.
So your father, so dignified,


272
00:28:48.276 --> 00:28:52.278
beat the guy to a
pulp with brass knuckles.


273
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:58.550
Fucking fool. He
couldn't stand rats though.


274
00:29:08.162 --> 00:29:11.430
He's suppose to
get out soon right?


275
00:29:11.432 --> 00:29:13.832
Like next year or something?

276
00:29:13.834 --> 00:29:17.069
He got out a few
months ago I think.


277
00:29:17.071 --> 00:29:25.071
What? Mom, mom.
You say Dad got out already?


278
00:29:29.283 --> 00:29:32.951
Yeah. Wanda said
she ran into his brother and


279
00:29:32.953 --> 00:29:39.591
he said Bobby got out on
parole a few months ago.


280
00:29:39.593 --> 00:29:44.263
You didn't think he was coming
back for you did you?


281
00:29:44.265 --> 00:29:52.265
No.Just thought he would want
to meet his own daughter.


282
00:29:56.644 --> 00:29:59.411
Shit.

283
00:30:28.242 --> 00:30:32.144
Hey-can I go over tonight?

284
00:30:32.146 --> 00:30:34.847
Yeah.

285
00:30:34.849 --> 00:30:38.484
Laura, are you talking
through my class?


286
00:30:38.486 --> 00:30:44.423
No she
wasn't Mr. Johns, I was.


287
00:30:44.425 --> 00:30:49.228
Better pay attention
or you'll be spending


288
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:52.231
your summer in here with me.

289
00:30:58.706 --> 00:31:02.841
Carly, to
the Principal's office please.


290
00:31:20.795 --> 00:31:23.562
What's that?

291
00:31:23.564 --> 00:31:25.564
We have reason to
believe you robbed an apartment


292
00:31:25.566 --> 00:31:29.134
on Main Street last
week and stole some items.


293
00:31:29.136 --> 00:31:33.038
Ok. I didn't.
What apartment?


294
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.641
We know you pawned a game
system and some games


295
00:31:35.643 --> 00:31:38.110
that were reported
stolen just days before.


296
00:31:38.112 --> 00:31:41.780
That fucker. I knew
that would get back to me.


297
00:31:41.782 --> 00:31:43.982
You admit to the robbery, Carly?

298
00:31:43.984 --> 00:31:45.717
No. No, uh

299
00:31:45.719 --> 00:31:51.490
if I told you someone gave me
those games to pawn,


300
00:31:51.492 --> 00:31:54.326
would I have to tell you who?

301
00:31:54.328 --> 00:31:57.329
Yes, you would.

302
00:31:57.331 --> 00:32:02.234
And if I told you
it was my game system?


303
00:32:02.236 --> 00:32:04.236
You're fucking arresting me?

304
00:32:04.238 --> 00:32:06.738
Turn around miss.

305
00:32:09.276 --> 00:32:11.276
You have the right to remain
silent, you have the right


306
00:32:11.278 --> 00:32:13.912
to an attorney,
if you can not afford an


307
00:32:13.914 --> 00:32:18.250
attorney one will
be appointed for you.


308
00:33:08.068 --> 00:33:12.971
As soon as we walk
out of the office the fucking


309
00:33:12.973 --> 00:33:18.076
bell rings, everyone came out
into the hallway. They were


310
00:33:18.078 --> 00:33:20.812
all staring at me. It's like
they planned it like that.


311
00:33:20.814 --> 00:33:23.749
Everybody was talking about it.

312
00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:26.418
It sounded crazy.

313
00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:28.654
And the I had to g
et my fingerprint done at


314
00:33:28.656 --> 00:33:30.656
the station, which
was actually kind of fun.


315
00:33:30.658 --> 00:33:34.893
I got a court date next week.
Probably get community service.


316
00:33:34.895 --> 00:33:37.596
I don't have anything
on my record, so...


317
00:33:37.598 --> 00:33:39.731
Well, that kind of sucks.

318
00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:42.067
Whatever.
It was kind of funny.


319
00:33:44.238 --> 00:33:46.538
What did Martha say?

320
00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.508
She was drunk when
they dropped me off,


321
00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.911
I doubt she will even remember.

322
00:33:54.915 --> 00:33:57.382
You girls ok?

323
00:33:57.384 --> 00:34:02.688
- Yeah were good.
- Sorry. Ouch!


324
00:34:07.428 --> 00:34:11.263
Was it a good plate?

325
00:34:11.265 --> 00:34:16.301
God, I can't wait to
get out of this place.


326
00:34:16.303 --> 00:34:19.538
Where would you
go? Your Dad's?


327
00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.275
Well, my Mom and Dad were
talking and they agreed


328
00:34:23.277 --> 00:34:26.078
to let me stay
with him for the summer!


329
00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.080
What?
That's amazing!


330
00:34:28.082 --> 00:34:29.615
I know

331
00:34:29.617 --> 00:34:32.818
and he said we could set the
instruments up in the wreck room


332
00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:38.523
and we can use it as
a jam space.


333
00:34:42.396 --> 00:34:44.496
How long have you had these?

334
00:34:44.498 --> 00:34:46.898
I don't know?

335
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:53.171
Did you do this to her ears?
Did you use rubbing alcohol?


336
00:34:53.173 --> 00:34:57.976
Well they'll get infected.
That'll be nice.


337
00:35:20.367 --> 00:35:25.303
- Sweet! Look at this.
- I think that looks good.


338
00:35:25.305 --> 00:35:29.975
Right. With some
stage light on it.


339
00:35:29.977 --> 00:35:34.012
It's going to be badass.

340
00:35:34.014 --> 00:35:36.181
You know that song we were
working on the other day.


341
00:35:36.183 --> 00:35:38.684
With the screamy chorus.

342
00:35:38.686 --> 00:35:40.786
Yeah. I think that one's in
my other lyric book upstairs.


343
00:35:40.788 --> 00:35:42.854
I'll be right back.

344
00:36:21.028 --> 00:36:23.095
Mornin' ladies.

345
00:36:23.097 --> 00:36:25.097
Mmmm...

346
00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:27.099
What's all this about?

347
00:36:27.101 --> 00:36:30.168
First official day of
summer break. I think that is


348
00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:34.106
a reason to
celebrate, don't you?


349
00:36:34.108 --> 00:36:37.943
Not for me! I got
summer classes.


350
00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:41.046
It's just
science, you'll be fine.


351
00:36:41.048 --> 00:36:43.782
Let me know if you need help
with any home work or anything,


352
00:36:43.784 --> 00:36:47.018
I was decent
at science in school.


353
00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:53.091
- Yeah, ok.
- What is that look?


354
00:36:53.093 --> 00:36:55.260
I just don't believe you.
Can you even


355
00:36:55.262 --> 00:36:57.262
remember that long ago?

356
00:36:59.266 --> 00:37:02.200
Don't listen
to her. Science was my subject.


357
00:37:02.202 --> 00:37:06.104
He likes you.

358
00:37:21.088 --> 00:37:24.723
We should play a show
at the end of the summer.


359
00:37:24.725 --> 00:37:28.160
Yeah? You think
we'll be ready?


360
00:37:28.162 --> 00:37:33.999
Yeah, I could maybe just
sing. We don't need bass.


361
00:37:34.001 --> 00:37:37.602
Corey's cousins
say he has a drum kit,


362
00:37:37.604 --> 00:37:39.771
apparently he's willing to jam.

363
00:37:39.773 --> 00:37:41.773
That's cool.

364
00:37:41.775 --> 00:37:44.409
You think Wayne would mind
if we put a drum kit in here?


365
00:37:44.411 --> 00:37:49.281
Probably not. He's
really supportive of the band.


366
00:37:49.283 --> 00:37:54.085
Yeah, he's really cool.
You don't think he minds


367
00:37:54.087 --> 00:37:56.421
that I'm here all the time?

368
00:37:56.423 --> 00:37:59.424
No, he likes you!

369
00:37:59.426 --> 00:38:04.696
How do you know?
Did he say something?


370
00:38:04.698 --> 00:38:12.698
- Yeah, he said you're funny.
- What? When?


371
00:38:13.173 --> 00:38:18.643
Just like the other day. He
likes having us here.


372
00:38:18.645 --> 00:38:21.780
Gives him something to do.

373
00:38:21.782 --> 00:38:26.218
When should we have
that drummer guy over?


374
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.787
Man, this will be fun.

375
00:38:28.789 --> 00:38:32.257
Yeah. I don't
know, I'll talk to him.


376
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:47.405
Hey. I was hoping I could
take you up on the offer to.


377
00:38:47.407 --> 00:38:50.275
Oh! Right, of
course. Here, sit down.


378
00:38:57.251 --> 00:38:59.985
Show me what you got?
What you're hung up on?


379
00:38:59.987 --> 00:39:03.855
- Right here.
- Let's see.


380
00:39:10.931 --> 00:39:13.365
You see the difference?

381
00:39:13.367 --> 00:39:17.569
Yeah, that makes sense.

382
00:39:17.571 --> 00:39:22.340
Once you get the language
down it's a lot easier.


383
00:39:42.562 --> 00:39:44.562
What are you doing?

384
00:39:44.564 --> 00:39:47.132
Hey kiddo, I was
just helping Carly with


385
00:39:47.134 --> 00:39:49.134
some homework.

386
00:39:49.136 --> 00:39:51.136
Cool.

387
00:39:51.138 --> 00:39:55.373
I should start dinner, I
didn't realize how late it was.


388
00:39:55.375 --> 00:39:58.076
- You feel like you got it?
- Yeah. Yeah, thanks.


389
00:39:58.078 --> 00:40:00.712
Let me know if you
need anything else.


390
00:40:14.628 --> 00:40:17.896
You wash, I'll dry.

391
00:40:17.898 --> 00:40:22.334
Sure. There's
dish towels in the pantry.


392
00:40:40.821 --> 00:40:45.657
He really does
like me doesn't he?


393
00:40:45.659 --> 00:40:51.363
I knew it. He might think I'm
little young for him though.


394
00:40:51.365 --> 00:40:55.700
You're
a woman. Seduce him.


395
00:42:15.382 --> 00:42:17.582
What ya watching?

396
00:42:17.584 --> 00:42:23.521
Just flipping
through. What are you doing up?


397
00:42:23.523 --> 00:42:26.758
I thought you girls
were long asleep by now.


398
00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.259
I don't know, couldn't sleep.

399
00:42:35.068 --> 00:42:36.534
What's this?

400
00:42:37.471 --> 00:42:38.970
Bewitched.

401
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.140
Oh, no I haven't seen it.

402
00:42:52.085 --> 00:42:55.086
So, is she a witch then?

403
00:42:55.088 --> 00:42:56.554
That girl?

404
00:42:57.958 --> 00:43:05.958
Yeah, that's End or a, she's her
mother. And she's upset


405
00:43:06.066 --> 00:43:08.566
that Samantha is
married to a mortal.


406
00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:21.479
It would be kind of
cool to be a witch I think.


407
00:43:21.481 --> 00:43:26.017
Yeah, I suppose.

408
00:43:26.019 --> 00:43:34.019
But the immortal part... I don't
know, doesn't sound to fun.


409
00:43:34.194 --> 00:43:39.030
No? You wouldn't
want to live forever?


410
00:43:39.032 --> 00:43:46.037
I don't know, would get
kind of lonely after a while?


411
00:43:57.317 --> 00:44:05.317
Are you lonely Wayne?

412
00:44:05.358 --> 00:44:11.029
What a thing to say.

413
00:44:15.735 --> 00:44:19.370
Hey. I think you
should go to bed.


414
00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:25.743
Yeah, ok.
Good night.


415
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:21.799
Hello.

416
00:45:21.801 --> 00:45:28.139
Well then. I was
wondering if I'd hear from you.


417
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:36.141
You owe me money.
She's not here.


418
00:45:42.389 --> 00:45:45.123
Yeah, I'll tell her.

419
00:45:47.627 --> 00:45:55.627
- You miss me, Bobby?
- Fuck you.


420
00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.009
So when you turn 18 you
can apply for what's called a


421
00:46:05.011 --> 00:46:07.845
queens pardon, to get this
taken off your record. That's


422
00:46:07.847 --> 00:46:11.449
assuming you don't have anything
else on your record by then.


423
00:46:11.451 --> 00:46:14.952
You listen to me?
Ok, so what do you got?


424
00:46:14.954 --> 00:46:17.855
You got six months of
community services...


425
00:46:20.026 --> 00:46:26.097
You got... God damn it. Ok, what
else? Two days a week at the


426
00:46:26.099 --> 00:46:32.637
food bank. That's important.
Don't miss any of those days.


427
00:46:32.639 --> 00:46:36.841
Check in regulary with
your probabtion officer.


428
00:46:36.843 --> 00:46:39.777
That's yours. Don't
loose that. You got it?


429
00:46:45.285 --> 00:46:49.554
Six months of community
service at a food bank.


430
00:46:49.556 --> 00:46:54.359
So not that bad. Pretty good
actually, could be a lot worst.


431
00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:57.362
Yeah.

432
00:46:57.364 --> 00:47:01.299
I am still pretty
annoyed at Jason though.


433
00:47:01.301 --> 00:47:05.403
I can't be that mad, you know
how greasy that guy is.


434
00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:10.208
I should've known better.

435
00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:12.210
True.

436
00:47:12.212 --> 00:47:15.380
But no matter how greasy he is
I wasn't going to rat him out.


437
00:47:15.382 --> 00:47:18.483
I wouldn't rat anyone
out, I'm not a fucking rat.


438
00:47:24.257 --> 00:47:27.492
So Dad's out of prison.

439
00:47:27.494 --> 00:47:34.766
Whoa. Really?
Are you gonna see him?


440
00:47:34.768 --> 00:47:42.106
Dunno. So, I was thinking about
making posters for the show!


441
00:47:42.108 --> 00:47:46.744
Put some up around
town, the diner, here...


442
00:47:46.746 --> 00:47:49.180
Yeah, that would be cool.

443
00:47:59.259 --> 00:48:03.428
- Hello.
- Hey, Wayne?


444
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:04.929
Yeah?

445
00:48:06.366 --> 00:48:08.366
It's Carly.

446
00:48:08.368 --> 00:48:12.370
Oh hey, yeah Laura's
at her mom's tonight.


447
00:48:12.372 --> 00:48:18.109
- Oh, gotcha. Hey...
- What's up?


448
00:48:18.111 --> 00:48:22.814
I wanted to apologize.
For the other night,


449
00:48:22.816 --> 00:48:30.816
on the couch. I got
a carried away and...


450
00:48:31.391 --> 00:48:37.595
That's ok. Don't worry
about that. It's forgotten.


451
00:48:37.597 --> 00:48:43.067
Oh! Forgotten
already? I guess girls do that


452
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:47.138
sort of thing to you a lot, huh?

453
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:55.140
No, not exactly. I meant, don't
feel embarrassed or anything.


454
00:48:58.318 --> 00:49:02.987
Have you thought about it since?

455
00:49:08.962 --> 00:49:13.998
I have. That's why
I was wondering if you've


456
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.469
also been thinking about it.

457
00:49:18.471 --> 00:49:25.676
I'm not really sure
what you're getting at.


458
00:49:25.678 --> 00:49:33.678
You're just so handsome,
I get nervous being around you.


459
00:49:35.889 --> 00:49:43.889
I guess I got caught up...
Looking at your lips.


460
00:49:44.163 --> 00:49:47.999
Wondering what they taste like.

461
00:49:48.001 --> 00:49:52.403
Do you wnat me to tell you what
else I've been thinking about?


462
00:49:52.405 --> 00:49:57.008
No, no I don't. Listen...

463
00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:01.245
I'm touching myself.

464
00:50:01.247 --> 00:50:07.818
Carly, you're in high school
and I think you had a crush-


465
00:50:07.820 --> 00:50:11.722
Girls have crushes.
I'm a woman. I'm into you.


466
00:50:11.724 --> 00:50:14.559
Why are you making
this such a big deal?


467
00:50:14.561 --> 00:50:17.995
How do you think
Laura would feel?


468
00:50:17.997 --> 00:50:21.999
If she knew that you
were doing this?


469
00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:24.268
Do you think she
would do the same


470
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:26.871
to you if the roles
were reversed?


471
00:50:26.873 --> 00:50:32.276
Maybe she would
just want me to be happy.


472
00:50:32.278 --> 00:50:36.614
Yeah, ok. You're welcome
to come over here any time


473
00:50:36.616 --> 00:50:43.020
with Laura
but this flirting is too much.


474
00:50:43.022 --> 00:50:50.895
Too much because you can't
handle how bad you want me?


475
00:50:50.897 --> 00:50:57.301
I'm kidding!
Ok, Wayne it's fine, I'm joking!


476
00:50:57.303 --> 00:51:02.006
Ok. I'm going to
hang up now. Goodbye.


477
00:51:29.068 --> 00:51:31.702
Ok.
Something like this?


478
00:51:35.241 --> 00:51:40.911
Yeah, I like that.

479
00:51:40.913 --> 00:51:44.982
Sweet. We're
gonna' be so awesome.


480
00:51:44.984 --> 00:51:48.352
- Yeah, I hope so.
- We will.


481
00:51:52.458 --> 00:51:57.161
So I need to
talk to you about something.


482
00:51:57.163 --> 00:52:04.201
- Ok.
- I've been seeing Jason.


483
00:52:04.203 --> 00:52:08.372
Ok?

484
00:52:08.374 --> 00:52:11.308
No, I've been seing
Jason for a while now.


485
00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:16.614
I didn't tell you because
I thought you would be mad.


486
00:52:16.616 --> 00:52:19.383
Are you mad?

487
00:52:19.385 --> 00:52:24.722
No. I think that's
great actually.


488
00:52:24.724 --> 00:52:27.058
Oh. I felt bad
hiding that from you.


489
00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:33.364
No. You guys fuck
all you want. You should!


490
00:52:33.366 --> 00:52:36.801
As long as you're
happy. I'm happy.


491
00:54:30.149 --> 00:54:32.817
We shouldn't done that.

492
00:54:32.819 --> 00:54:35.519
Shhhh.

493
00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:44.628
Sorry. We can't
like you know keep...


494
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:47.431
No talking.

495
00:54:54.173 --> 00:54:56.240
Gross.

496
00:55:25.204 --> 00:55:27.805
Hello.

497
00:55:27.807 --> 00:55:31.008
- Hi Carly, it's Lisa.
- Hi Lisa. What's up?


498
00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:33.244
Sweet pea, Laura was
supposed to watch Tyler


499
00:55:33.246 --> 00:55:35.546
and she ran off with Jason
somewhere and I don't know


500
00:55:35.548 --> 00:55:37.548
when she'll be back.
Could you come over and


501
00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:39.550
watch Tyler for a few hours?

502
00:55:39.552 --> 00:55:42.753
Yeah, yeah I
could do that. Sure.


503
00:56:23.863 --> 00:56:27.364
You should be together.

504
00:56:37.977 --> 00:56:42.379
Hey? What
are you doing here?


505
00:56:42.381 --> 00:56:45.950
Your Mom asked me to watch
Tyler. She said you were out


506
00:56:45.952 --> 00:56:49.887
with Jason, she didn't
know how long you would be.


507
00:56:49.889 --> 00:56:57.889
- I wasn't with Jason.
- Are you okay?


508
00:56:58.564 --> 00:57:01.865
Well, I guess we will see.

509
00:57:09.608 --> 00:57:14.678
How long do you
think it has been?


510
00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:18.816
Dunno. Four
minutes maybe?


511
00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:46.443
Shit. Shit. Fuck.

512
00:57:57.189 --> 00:58:05.189
It's going to be
ok. We'll be fine.


513
00:58:06.465 --> 00:58:10.567
Hold on!

514
00:58:22.715 --> 00:58:29.520
Are you going to tell Jason?

515
00:58:29.522 --> 00:58:37.522
I dunno. What if
he wants me to keep it?


516
00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.203
Do you know what you want to do?

517
00:58:46.205 --> 00:58:54.205
Well, I can't keep
it. I can't take care of a baby.


518
00:58:54.747 --> 00:59:02.747
And Mom wouldn't be any help
she can barely take care of us.


519
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:10.094
Ugh, I don't even want to
think about what Dad will say.


520
00:59:10.096 --> 00:59:13.530
He doesn't have
to know. No one does.


521
00:59:13.532 --> 00:59:17.000
We can go to the clinic tomorrow
and see what your options are.


522
00:59:24.477 --> 00:59:28.445
I think Mary's sister had an
abortion a few years ago.


523
00:59:28.447 --> 00:59:30.914
We could ask her.

524
00:59:30.916 --> 00:59:34.451
I don't know if
I want an abortion.


525
00:59:34.453 --> 00:59:42.453
It's going to be ok.
This happens all the time.


526
00:59:43.329 --> 00:59:46.930
We'll figure it out.

527
00:59:46.932 --> 00:59:49.066
Yeah.

528
00:59:51.804 --> 00:59:55.839
- What the fuck?
- Sounds like Ken's home.


529
00:59:58.577 --> 01:00:01.245
Hey who broke
this? Come here you little shit.


530
01:00:01.247 --> 01:00:03.280
And he's drunk.

531
01:00:03.282 --> 01:00:05.282
Don't leave shit
by the door! I told you!


532
01:00:05.284 --> 01:00:07.918
Jesus.

533
01:00:10.656 --> 01:00:16.260
Hey. You're
going to be ok.


534
01:00:38.951 --> 01:00:41.552
- Hey.
- Yeah.


535
01:00:47.826 --> 01:00:51.361
You staying out?

536
01:00:51.363 --> 01:00:54.364
Dunno yet. Can I
grab a couple?


537
01:01:05.044 --> 01:01:07.711
See ya.

538
01:01:36.442 --> 01:01:38.742
What did you tell your Mother?

539
01:01:38.744 --> 01:01:40.944
Nothing. Just said
I was going out.


540
01:01:40.946 --> 01:01:43.780
She never ask with
who or where or anything.


541
01:01:48.554 --> 01:01:51.955
So, do you want to do?

542
01:01:51.957 --> 01:01:54.891
We could go
get dinner or something?


543
01:01:54.893 --> 01:01:57.194
We can't go out
in public anywhere,


544
01:01:57.196 --> 01:02:01.798
what if we see someone we know?

545
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:05.102
Why did you pick me up
then if we can't go anywhere?


546
01:02:05.104 --> 01:02:08.939
I wanted to talk to you.

547
01:02:08.941 --> 01:02:16.941
Look Carly, I shouldn't have
let that happen the other night.


548
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:20.651
Why?
I wasn't good?


549
01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:23.787
No, God it's not that.
It shouldn've happened


550
01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:28.458
because it's not appropriate.

551
01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:32.462
Hey, no, no.
I'm driving here.


552
01:02:32.464 --> 01:02:34.765
Wanna go park
somewhere and make out?


553
01:02:34.767 --> 01:02:39.903
No, cause I'm
not in high school.


554
01:02:39.905 --> 01:02:43.740
You're not 18. I
know you lied to me.


555
01:02:43.742 --> 01:02:45.742
Why are you saying that?

556
01:02:45.744 --> 01:02:48.145
It came up with
Lisa. I know you're 17.


557
01:02:48.147 --> 01:02:52.449
Awe Lisa... Are you
guys back together?


558
01:02:52.451 --> 01:02:55.118
What?

559
01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.021
You and Lisa seem
pretty close, that's all.


560
01:02:58.023 --> 01:03:00.590
We're family. Of
course we're close.


561
01:03:00.592 --> 01:03:06.163
Family? You
weren't even married.


562
01:03:06.165 --> 01:03:09.032
We have a child
together Carly, we will always


563
01:03:09.034 --> 01:03:14.137
be family. That's how this stuff
works. And that's not the point.


564
01:03:14.139 --> 01:03:17.140
I shouldn't let it
happen either way.


565
01:03:17.142 --> 01:03:21.878
- The age of consent is 16.
- What's that?


566
01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:28.719
Everyone think it's

567
01:03:28.721 --> 01:03:31.221
What if Laura finds out?

568
01:03:31.223 --> 01:03:37.361
She won't. I won't tell anyone
I just like being with you.


569
01:03:39.631 --> 01:03:42.199
Let's just take
some time alright.


570
01:03:42.201 --> 01:03:47.404
Some time to sit with this.
Ok? I guarentee you'll see it


571
01:03:47.406 --> 01:03:52.476
my way eventually, I know
you will. You're so young...


572
01:03:52.478 --> 01:03:58.315
Oh my God, I'm not a fucking
kid, I know what I'm doing.


573
01:03:58.317 --> 01:04:02.753
You know what?
Ugh, whatever. Take me home.


574
01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:06.723
- I know you're not a kid.
- Just take me home please.


575
01:04:06.725 --> 01:04:08.392
Alright.

576
01:05:08.921 --> 01:05:16.259
- Thank you young sir. Thank you.
- Ew. That's so gross.


577
01:05:16.261 --> 01:05:18.962
What?
It's just drool.


578
01:05:18.964 --> 01:05:22.599
Just drool? That's excalty
what is so gross about it.


579
01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:26.002
You don't know
where that kid's been.


580
01:05:31.477 --> 01:05:36.012
- I know what I want to do.
- What?


581
01:05:36.014 --> 01:05:41.284
I just, I know
what people will think


582
01:05:41.286 --> 01:05:45.155
but I just feel like I
should keep the baby.


583
01:05:45.157 --> 01:05:50.427
Like, I think
I'll be a good mom.


584
01:05:50.429 --> 01:05:52.662
What?

585
01:05:52.664 --> 01:05:55.866
Is that because of the
drool kid? You think you'll


586
01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:59.269
be a good mom? Handle
a bit of drool?


587
01:05:59.271 --> 01:06:01.972
I know it's not
great timing but...


588
01:06:01.974 --> 01:06:04.774
You're serious?

589
01:06:04.776 --> 01:06:08.044
I'm serious, yeah. I
think I'll be a good mom.


590
01:06:08.046 --> 01:06:12.015
And actually, I've
always wanted to be a mom so...


591
01:06:12.017 --> 01:06:16.219
maybe now is the time.

592
01:06:16.221 --> 01:06:21.124
Yeah. Sure. It's
whatever you want.


593
01:06:21.126 --> 01:06:24.494
I want to keep it.

594
01:06:29.635 --> 01:06:32.168
- Ok.
- Ok.


595
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:35.839
- Will you help me tell Mom?
- Fuck no.


596
01:06:35.841 --> 01:06:38.375
Carly!
Watch your mouth.


597
01:06:38.377 --> 01:06:40.577
If you think I'm not going to
swear around your kid


598
01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:44.347
you have got another
thing coming girl.


599
01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:48.218
Yes of course,
I'll help you tell her.


600
01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.387
Thank you.

601
01:06:56.595 --> 01:07:00.096
I should probably do this alone.

602
01:07:00.098 --> 01:07:05.702
You sure? I'll
totally go in with you.


603
01:07:05.704 --> 01:07:10.840
Thank you, but I'll be fine.

604
01:07:10.842 --> 01:07:13.777
Okay, good luck.

605
01:07:28.427 --> 01:07:31.261
Hello.

606
01:07:33.365 --> 01:07:35.432
Laura?

607
01:07:37.402 --> 01:07:39.536
Slow down I can't undertand you.

608
01:07:42.107 --> 01:07:44.274
Ok. No,
I'll be right there.


609
01:07:53.819 --> 01:07:55.585
No, I'm not done
talking to you yet.


610
01:07:55.587 --> 01:07:57.754
Do you have any idea how
much this will cost your Mother?


611
01:07:57.756 --> 01:07:59.756
- Leave her alone!
- You ungrateful bitch.


612
01:07:59.758 --> 01:08:01.558
Stop! This is
none of your business!


613
01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:03.560
Yea, that's right! None of this
is my fucking business,


614
01:08:03.562 --> 01:08:06.563
do you think I want to be here
taking care of all these kids?


615
01:08:06.565 --> 01:08:08.965
What, you think I'm the
bad guy here, me?


616
01:08:08.967 --> 01:08:12.335
And now a fucking retarded
baby too! Jesus Christ!


617
01:08:12.337 --> 01:08:16.072
I'm not the one who is fucking every single
guy in school, getting myself knocked up!


618
01:08:16.074 --> 01:08:20.076
You're always fucking taking food right out of
your brothers mouth you fucking little slut!


619
01:08:20.078 --> 01:08:21.411
Stop it!

620
01:08:21.413 --> 01:08:23.580
Hey Wayne, we're just
having a little chat here...


621
01:08:34.026 --> 01:08:39.996
Get out.
Right now.


622
01:08:39.998 --> 01:08:43.933
Get the hell out. Don't
ever come back. You got it?


623
01:08:45.937 --> 01:08:48.571
You fucking people.

624
01:08:50.642 --> 01:08:57.313
You girls okay? Lisa, don't
ever let him in here again.


625
01:08:57.315 --> 01:09:01.284
I know, I'm sorry.

626
01:09:01.286 --> 01:09:04.554
Hey, don't be sorry, it's okay.

627
01:09:04.556 --> 01:09:07.023
We just can't have
him around our family anymore?


628
01:09:07.025 --> 01:09:09.025
I'm a bad mom!

629
01:09:09.027 --> 01:09:12.896
Oh come
on stop! It's ok.


630
01:09:12.898 --> 01:09:15.031
Our familly?

631
01:09:20.038 --> 01:09:22.372
Why are you even here?

632
01:09:25.577 --> 01:09:29.179
I called him.

633
01:09:29.181 --> 01:09:32.982
Is this your family now?

634
01:09:32.984 --> 01:09:36.486
What's wrong with you Carly?

635
01:09:36.488 --> 01:09:39.322
Dad helped us.

636
01:09:39.324 --> 01:09:43.827
Is the the baby's okay?

637
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:47.430
Baby?
What baby?


638
01:09:47.432 --> 01:09:51.234
Oh, sorry I
thought you told him.


639
01:09:51.236 --> 01:09:54.537
No.

640
01:09:54.539 --> 01:09:56.973
Laura?
Are you pregnant?


641
01:10:01.012 --> 01:10:09.012
Oh my God.
Wow! Laura...


642
01:10:26.304 --> 01:10:29.038
Does that tickle?

643
01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.307
Laura.

644
01:11:03.341 --> 01:11:06.442
- Knock, knock.
- Hey! How was class?


645
01:11:06.444 --> 01:11:14.444
Ugh. But after class, I
made you a little something.


646
01:11:16.321 --> 01:11:19.389
What is this?

647
01:11:23.028 --> 01:11:27.797
Oh my god, this is so cute!

648
01:11:27.799 --> 01:11:31.167
And tiny, are they
really this tiny?


649
01:11:31.169 --> 01:11:36.105
- Apparently!
- Jeez Louise.


650
01:11:36.107 --> 01:11:39.976
So what did the doctor say?

651
01:11:39.978 --> 01:11:44.647
Oh, he said everything was
good. Looks normal so...


652
01:11:44.649 --> 01:11:50.887
Good. I was
getting a little worried.


653
01:11:50.889 --> 01:11:53.389
A little..

654
01:11:55.126 --> 01:11:58.194
Have you talked to Jason yet?

655
01:11:58.196 --> 01:12:00.930
Not yet.

656
01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:07.537
Where's Wayne?

657
01:12:07.539 --> 01:12:15.539
- I don't know.
- He's been out all day?


658
01:12:16.648 --> 01:12:24.254
- That is so cute. Look at that.
- Yeah, those are cute.


659
01:12:52.684 --> 01:12:56.686
Carly, sweetie.
Hey, sweetie.


660
01:13:00.859 --> 01:13:03.126
Hi...
Where were you?


661
01:13:03.128 --> 01:13:06.229
I was at a meeting.
Why are you on the couch?


662
01:13:06.231 --> 01:13:08.965
I wanted to see you.

663
01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:15.038
- Where's Laura?
- She's asleep.


664
01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:18.908
Come on, let me drive you home.

665
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:26.910
I wanna stay here.
I'm sorry.


666
01:13:27.619 --> 01:13:30.053
Sorry for what?

667
01:13:30.055 --> 01:13:34.724
The way I acted when you
picked me up the other night.


668
01:13:34.726 --> 01:13:38.294
I was afraid of losing you.

669
01:13:38.296 --> 01:13:43.166
It's ok, come on
let me drive you home.


670
01:13:43.168 --> 01:13:46.135
Why can't I just stay here?

671
01:13:46.137 --> 01:13:49.138
You can't sleep
here every night Carly.


672
01:13:52.811 --> 01:13:55.778
Why are you so
hot and cold all the time?


673
01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:59.782
I just don't think you should
be here every night, that's all.


674
01:13:59.784 --> 01:14:03.486
- Were you with Lisa?
- What? No.


675
01:14:03.488 --> 01:14:05.621
Are you seeing someone?

676
01:14:05.623 --> 01:14:07.824
Lower your voice.

677
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:19.068
Hey. Hey...

678
01:15:17.228 --> 01:15:20.363
Hey, where's Laura?

679
01:15:20.365 --> 01:15:22.498
At the venue.

680
01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:27.170
I was suppose to be
driving both of you guys.


681
01:15:27.172 --> 01:15:31.207
Oh no, I told her to
wait there after sound check


682
01:15:31.209 --> 01:15:34.277
and I would
meet up with her after.


683
01:15:43.922 --> 01:15:46.722
I'm so stoked to play this show.

684
01:15:46.724 --> 01:15:49.125
I hope there are a
lot of people there.


685
01:15:49.127 --> 01:15:51.527
I'm wondering if if
opening band is any good?


686
01:15:51.529 --> 01:15:54.397
Corey has seen them and
said they were pretty good.


687
01:15:54.399 --> 01:15:57.200
I haven't seen them but
I mean, we will probably


688
01:15:57.202 --> 01:15:59.535
be the best band there.

689
01:15:59.537 --> 01:16:02.572
- You did this one purpose.
- What do you mean?


690
01:16:02.574 --> 01:16:05.875
Oh come on. Just
for me to drive you.


691
01:16:05.877 --> 01:16:09.278
I said I would drive
both of you, together.


692
01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:12.715
Oh yeah, yeah. I just said she
should stay at the venue


693
01:16:12.717 --> 01:16:14.717
because somebody
had to work the door.


694
01:16:14.719 --> 01:16:16.752
And I had to go home and change.

695
01:16:16.754 --> 01:16:19.155
Look Carly, I'm going to say
this to you one more time


696
01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:24.393
and you got to hear me.
This can't go anywhere.


697
01:16:24.395 --> 01:16:26.462
Do you understand?

698
01:16:29.567 --> 01:16:32.101
Yeah, this about Lisa.

699
01:16:32.103 --> 01:16:34.637
No. God damn it,
it's not about Lisa!


700
01:16:34.639 --> 01:16:36.806
Then someone else?

701
01:16:36.808 --> 01:16:39.509
No that's not
what this is about.


702
01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:43.913
- Stop yelling.
- We can't see each other.


703
01:16:43.915 --> 01:16:46.149
I don't feel good.

704
01:16:46.151 --> 01:16:49.852
I don't want to hurt you. But
you don't seem to be hearing me.


705
01:16:49.854 --> 01:16:52.955
I can't lose you.

706
01:16:52.957 --> 01:16:59.862
Lose me. Carly
we're not a thing.


707
01:16:59.864 --> 01:17:03.666
I don't feel good.

708
01:17:03.668 --> 01:17:06.369
Carly, wait!

709
01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:08.938
Carly wait!

710
01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.174
I don't wantt to
see you right now.


711
01:17:11.176 --> 01:17:14.177
Carly, please.
Just relax, it'll be okay.


712
01:17:14.179 --> 01:17:16.512
Carly, get back in the car.

713
01:17:16.514 --> 01:17:18.814
I know you're upset.
I don't do this.


714
01:17:18.816 --> 01:17:22.218
I can't believe this.
I love you so much...


715
01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:26.322
I would never do this to you.

716
01:17:26.324 --> 01:17:29.692
God damn it!
Carly!


717
01:17:29.694 --> 01:17:34.163
Carly, get back in the car,
I'll still give you a ride.


718
01:17:34.165 --> 01:17:37.600
I'm going to play my
show, don't come!


719
01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:57.453
Where's Carly?

720
01:18:05.363 --> 01:18:06.829
I am gonna go find her.

721
01:18:13.438 --> 01:18:15.438
Have you seen Carly?

722
01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.708
You guys seen Carly?

723
01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:21.043
No we haven't seen her.

724
01:18:21.045 --> 01:18:25.014
Carly! Carly!

725
01:18:28.453 --> 01:18:32.455
Carly!
Are you okay?


726
01:18:32.457 --> 01:18:34.523
I'm so sorry Laura.

727
01:18:34.525 --> 01:18:38.127
It's ok, we still have
time to go play our show.


728
01:18:38.129 --> 01:18:41.564
Wow, pathetic.

729
01:18:41.566 --> 01:18:43.866
I don't
know why he doesn't love me.


730
01:18:43.868 --> 01:18:47.703
- Who? Jason?
- - I'm so mad.


731
01:18:47.705 --> 01:18:49.705
Are you upset about Jason?

732
01:18:50.408 --> 01:18:54.010
Guys! Guys,
something's wrong with Carly.


733
01:18:56.114 --> 01:18:59.148
She's just high
Laura, it'll wear off soon.


734
01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:01.150
No, It's something else,
she can't breath look at her.


735
01:19:01.152 --> 01:19:04.587
Oh shit! She's fucked
up! What did she take?


736
01:19:04.589 --> 01:19:06.889
I don't know. Maybe this?
She smokes this sometimes.


737
01:19:06.891 --> 01:19:10.559
Jesus Christ! You're
lucky she's not fucking dead.


738
01:19:10.561 --> 01:19:11.627
Should we take
her to the hospital?


739
01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:13.596
Yeah, probably.

740
01:19:13.598 --> 01:19:16.132
Ok no, she doesn't need a hospital,
she's just high. It will wear off soon.


741
01:19:16.134 --> 01:19:18.100
Alright, well I can't risk this
shit, I'm on probation.


742
01:19:18.102 --> 01:19:19.435
I'm gonna bounce.

743
01:19:19.437 --> 01:19:21.504
- Matt!
- I am gonna bounce!


744
01:19:23.474 --> 01:19:25.241
I can't Laura, I am sorry.

745
01:19:25.243 --> 01:19:30.313
Jason what the... Matt!
Somebody help please!


746
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:35.851
What happened?

747
01:19:35.853 --> 01:19:38.154
I don't know. I think she
needs to go to the hospital,


748
01:19:38.156 --> 01:19:41.924
she can't breath.

749
01:19:41.926 --> 01:19:45.461
Okay, bring her to my car.

750
01:19:45.463 --> 01:19:48.664
Aerosol?

751
01:19:48.666 --> 01:19:52.034
Yeah, a can of air
freshener. I think she was


752
01:19:52.036 --> 01:19:57.206
inhaling it. I don't know, some
kids at school do it.


753
01:19:57.208 --> 01:19:59.275
I can't get a
hold of her mom. How is she?


754
01:19:59.277 --> 01:20:01.277
Okay Carly, how many fingers?

755
01:20:06.217 --> 01:20:08.284
This is his fault...

756
01:20:13.291 --> 01:20:15.191
I need you to put this mask on.

757
01:20:20.965 --> 01:20:23.332
Wayne.
Wayne, I told him.


758
01:20:23.334 --> 01:20:26.469
I don't why she keeps saying
his name. That's my Dad.


759
01:20:26.471 --> 01:20:29.405
Carly, he's on his
way. He'll be here soon.


760
01:20:29.407 --> 01:20:32.808
What? No, no, no...

761
01:20:36.013 --> 01:20:41.350
He told me he loved me.
He loved me.


762
01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:48.824
What happened with Wayne Carly?

763
01:20:48.826 --> 01:20:51.861
He fucked me.

764
01:20:57.902 --> 01:20:59.902
Hey.
What happened?


765
01:20:59.904 --> 01:21:02.004
Dad, what the fuck did you do?

766
01:22:31.762 --> 01:22:38.000
- Hey.
- Can I help you, Carly?


767
01:22:38.002 --> 01:22:44.707
I just haven't seen Laura
around since school started.


768
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:48.644
Wanted to see how she was doing?

769
01:22:48.646 --> 01:22:52.681
She's tired and
morning sickness so...


770
01:22:52.683 --> 01:22:57.219
Just going to keep
her home a while longer.


771
01:22:57.221 --> 01:23:05.221
I got her a present.
If she's up for a visitor?


772
01:23:07.698 --> 01:23:14.537
She's really tired, sweetie.
But when she wakes up


773
01:23:14.539 --> 01:23:18.874
I can give it to
her if you want.


774
01:23:34.825 --> 01:23:42.825
Wait Lisa. I'm sorry I messed
eveything up for you guys.


775
01:23:50.074 --> 01:23:53.542
You didn't do it alone.

776
01:23:53.544 --> 01:23:57.947
He's a grown up.
He knows better.


777
01:23:57.949 --> 01:24:00.616
It wasn't like that.

778
01:24:04.889 --> 01:24:07.022
Sweetheart, you made
a little girl's decision


779
01:24:07.024 --> 01:24:10.292
and you are paying big girl
consequences but it's not...


780
01:24:10.294 --> 01:24:18.294
People are quick to judge but
you did not do this alone.


781
01:24:24.241 --> 01:24:27.109
It sure feels like it.

782
01:24:27.111 --> 01:24:31.680
You're alone.

783
01:24:34.151 --> 01:24:41.256
He is being made accountable
too. But he's Laura's dad.


784
01:24:41.258 --> 01:24:49.258
We're a family and we got to
do what it takes to stay close.


785
01:24:55.673 --> 01:24:59.675
Yeah no, I understand.

786
01:25:32.943 --> 01:25:38.580
Hey. I was wondering
when I'd see you again.


787
01:25:41.786 --> 01:25:49.786
I lost him and I lost Laura, I
don't know what to do.


788
01:25:54.799 --> 01:25:57.700
If you gave him a baby,

789
01:25:57.702 --> 01:26:01.637
you would be part of the family.

790
01:26:19.223 --> 01:26:22.124
Why did you stop?

791
01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:51.653
Finish inside of me.

792
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:35.123
You can't be here.

793
01:28:37.528 --> 01:28:39.595
You hear me?
You can't be here.


794
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:44.266
Hi..

795
01:28:44.869 --> 01:28:46.702
Let me come in.

796
01:28:46.704 --> 01:28:50.739
What? No, absolutely not.

797
01:28:50.741 --> 01:28:51.874
No!

798
01:28:51.876 --> 01:28:53.942
Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I..

799
01:28:57.214 --> 01:28:59.281
I love you!

800
01:29:00.484 --> 01:29:04.519
I can't see you Carly,
do you understand?


801
01:29:04.521 --> 01:29:06.488
I can't see you!

802
01:29:06.824 --> 01:29:11.326
And I'll be 18 soon. I
fucked up. I know I fucked up.


803
01:29:11.328 --> 01:29:14.663
I lost everything!

804
01:29:14.665 --> 01:29:16.131
You understand?

805
01:29:16.834 --> 01:29:18.901
I don't know
what I was thinking..


806
01:29:19.169 --> 01:29:23.238
Look, I fucked up and
I've lost everything.


807
01:29:24.775 --> 01:29:29.845
Laura won't answer my
calls. I'm drinking again.


808
01:29:30.447 --> 01:29:36.618
I can't even walk my own fucking block
without the neighbors looking at me funny.


809
01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:41.857
- I'm pregnant.
- What?


810
01:29:41.859 --> 01:29:46.628
No, I'm sorry. I'm not
pregnant. I'm not.


811
01:29:46.630 --> 01:29:48.697
Jesus Christ!

812
01:29:48.699 --> 01:29:50.933
I'll give you a
baby if you want one.


813
01:29:53.237 --> 01:29:58.140
I have a child and she won't
speak to me because of you.


814
01:29:58.142 --> 01:30:01.376
I don't want a
fucking baby with you.


815
01:30:01.378 --> 01:30:04.212
I don't want anything
with you. Nothing!


816
01:30:16.226 --> 01:30:20.996
I know I'm the adult
in this situation and...


817
01:30:20.998 --> 01:30:28.998
I messed up and this
isn't your fault.


818
01:30:29.306 --> 01:30:33.675
No, you didn't do
anything wrong, I love you.


819
01:30:33.677 --> 01:30:39.881
I have to be responsibility.
You understand? Look at me.


820
01:30:45.689 --> 01:30:48.490
If you don't leave right now
I'm going to call the police.


821
01:30:48.492 --> 01:30:54.930
No. No, please. Wait...

822
01:30:54.932 --> 01:30:57.599
I have nothing
left to lose, kid.


823
01:31:13.984 --> 01:31:17.652
What's wrong now?

824
01:31:17.654 --> 01:31:24.126
No. I do not want
to see you right now.


825
01:31:42.813 --> 01:31:47.916
I ran into Shelley at
the liquor store today.


826
01:31:47.918 --> 01:31:52.487
Yeah?
How's Shelley doing?


827
01:31:52.489 --> 01:31:57.926
She blamed me for what happened
between you and that man.


828
01:32:03.867 --> 01:32:06.735
She said everyone in town is
talking about how I let


829
01:32:06.737 --> 01:32:10.105
you do whatever you want.
How I don't set boundaries.


830
01:32:17.014 --> 01:32:21.283
Hey, hey Mom. It's okay.

831
01:32:21.285 --> 01:32:29.285
No! It's not. Everyone I know
thinks I'm a bad Mother


832
01:32:32.129 --> 01:32:37.799
and I just don't know, Carly.
You've always been


833
01:32:37.801 --> 01:32:40.535
so independent and I've
never really had to raise you.


834
01:32:40.537 --> 01:32:46.775
You raised yourself. And I was
doing it alone, and...


835
01:32:46.777 --> 01:32:54.777
Mom, look at me.
You're doing a fine job.


836
01:32:55.652 --> 01:32:58.720
I'm going to be ok.

837
01:33:08.332 --> 01:33:13.135
She never even asks about you.

838
01:33:13.137 --> 01:33:16.138
What? So she's
not perfect.


839
01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:17.172
She's not perfect.

840
01:33:17.174 --> 01:33:23.445
But she's the
only... she needs me.


841
01:33:23.447 --> 01:33:26.181
She needs me.

842
01:33:26.183 --> 01:33:27.182
And at least she stuck around.

843
01:33:27.184 --> 01:33:30.085
And at least she stuck around.

844
01:33:30.087 --> 01:33:33.155
Dad never took..

845
01:33:36.093 --> 01:33:37.292
Responsibility

846
01:33:37.294 --> 01:33:39.361
Responsibility

847
01:33:45.135 --> 01:33:51.039
You don't make me feel good. I
think you should go away.


848
01:34:25.542 --> 01:34:33.542
Bobby called. He wants you to
call him. If you want to.


849
01:34:34.351 --> 01:34:37.652
But don't feel obligated you
don't owe him anything.


850
01:35:22.099 --> 01:35:25.500
Hi.
It's Carly.


851
01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:31.740
I would really like to
see you in person and talk.


852
01:35:31.742 --> 01:35:34.042
If you're feeling up to it.

853
01:35:58.802 --> 01:36:01.403
- Hey.
- Hey.


854
01:36:13.183 --> 01:36:20.755
- Can you forgive me?
- Forgive you?


855
01:36:20.757 --> 01:36:24.793
Carly, it was Dad's fault.

856
01:36:24.795 --> 01:36:28.997
No, I need to
take some responsibility.


857
01:36:34.971 --> 01:36:40.508
I was being so
selfish and I didn't think


858
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:45.480
about how it
would affect this...


859
01:36:45.482 --> 01:36:53.482
It's just weird for me. I
don't want to think about it.


860
01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:01.463
And I'll accept that
you made some bad choices


861
01:37:01.465 --> 01:37:06.167
but you have to accept that

862
01:37:06.169 --> 01:37:12.273
I just think we should see
each other for awhile.


863
01:37:15.379 --> 01:37:23.379
And I don't blame you.
I'm not mad at.


864
01:37:28.925 --> 01:37:31.493
But it's just so weird.

865
01:37:34.231 --> 01:37:38.400
You understand that, right?

866
01:37:43.507 --> 01:37:48.843
Do you want to yell at me? You
can yell at me if you want to.


867
01:37:48.845 --> 01:37:52.647
I don't want to
yell at you, Carly.


868
01:38:06.096 --> 01:38:11.933
Will you at least call him?

869
01:38:11.935 --> 01:38:14.569
That's not your business.

870
01:38:23.313 --> 01:38:26.314
Take care of yourself Carly.
