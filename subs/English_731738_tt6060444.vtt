I'm sorry, baby,
he's not answering.


170
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.712
Could you call again?

171
00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:48.248
Honey, I don't think
we can keep on waiting.


172
00:10:50.115 --> 00:10:52.051
Hey, we can go
to the comic store.


173
00:10:52.085 --> 00:10:54.253
You know, another weekend
reading with mom?


174
00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.455
No, yeah.

175
00:10:56.488 --> 00:10:57.724
I'm sick of that, too.

Hey, buddy.

179
00:11:02.762 --> 00:11:03.997
Sorry to keep you waiting.

180
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:07.100
But I had to go I clear across
town to get you this, like it?


181
00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.535
- [Ed] Yeah!
- Yeah? It's cool, right?


182
00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.603
Just look at that little antenna
too so check it out.


183
00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:11.571
You got a supercharger here

184
00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:13.407
and it's really cool,
it's really amazing.

Hey, Caryn!

186

You're looking great,
I love the hair.


187
00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:18.145
It's very now.

188
00:11:18.177 --> 00:11:19.578
Ever the charmer.

189
00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:21.647
Mm-hm, yeah.
So we really should get going.


190
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:22.782
I got a big day ahead of us.

191
00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:24.417
Hey, a big day.

192
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.286
What you got planned?

193
00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:28.722
Well, we got the whole weekend
ahead of us to, you know,


194
00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:31.457
two full days
of all kinds of stuff.


195

- Stuff?
- Mm-hm.


196
00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.761
Well, day and a half now, so...

197
00:11:34.793 --> 00:11:36.328
Nah, it's plenty of time.

198
00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:37.631
To?

199
00:11:39.532 --> 00:11:41.701
To go to...

200
00:11:44.536 --> 00:11:45.772
Magic Land.

201
00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:49.676
Ma... Magic Land?

202
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.511
- [Danny] You got it, buddy.
- Magic Land?


203
00:11:51.543 --> 00:11:52.778
It was supposed to be
a surprise,


204
00:11:52.811 --> 00:11:54.380
but, hey, did you bring
swim trunks?


205
00:11:54.413 --> 00:11:56.749
Don't worry about it. We could
pick some up on the way.


206
00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:58.451
Hey, isn't that a bit much?

207
00:11:58.484 --> 00:12:00.253
By the time you get through
the gates, it'll be dark.


208
00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:02.589
We're gonna make it, I promise.

209
00:12:02.622 --> 00:12:04.657
- I promise.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:12:09.229 --> 00:12:10.263
Okay.

213
00:12:10.729 --> 00:12:11.731
Yes!

214
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.402
- [Caryn] Hey.
- Hmm?


215
00:12:15.435 --> 00:12:18.405
You said you wanted

216
00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:21.474
When you say you're gonna
do something, do it.


217
00:12:22.142 --> 00:12:24.176
My word is bond.

218
00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:25.778
Cross my heart, hope to die.

219
00:12:26.778 --> 00:12:28.547
[Danny] I got it.

220
00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.450
There's fireworks,
we gotta stay for that.


221
00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:32.786
- Yes!
- 10:00 p.m., I think, uh...


222
00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:34.688
that should be pretty fun.
Okay, all right.


223
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.821
There he is. That's him!

224
00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:38.325
All right, all right, calm down.
I'll take care of it.


225
00:12:38.358 --> 00:12:40.359
- Hey, bud, is this you?
- Yep, it is.


226
00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:41.795
I told her I'd be back
in a minute.


227
00:12:41.828 --> 00:12:43.463
- [man] A minute?
- Don't worry about it.


228
00:12:43.495 --> 00:12:44.463
[woman] I had an appointment!

229
00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:46.532
I've been here for 10,
she's been here for 20.


230
00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:48.567
- [woman] I'm late!
- Hey!


231
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.870
- I'm talking to you, dork!
- Mm, hi.


232
00:12:50.903 --> 00:12:52.538
You think you own this place?

233
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:54.407
Don't you people know
how to park?


234
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.810
No, can't park, can't drive,
can't help it.


235

- [horn honks]

236

- [Ed] Dad?
- [Danny] Yeah, buddy?


237
00:13:06.418 --> 00:13:08.354
Do you know any kung fu?

238
00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:10.157
First of all,
it's called <i>gung fu.</i>


239
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.558
That's how we say it in Chinese.

240
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.325
But, no, I don't, why?

241
00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:14.393
I saw pictures.

242
00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:15.896
- Where?
- [Ed] In the garage.


243
00:13:15.929 --> 00:13:17.631
There's a bunch of pictures.

244
00:13:17.663 --> 00:13:19.565
All right, all right,
you got me.


245
00:13:19.599 --> 00:13:21.868
That was a very, very, very
long time ago.


246
00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:23.703
Who's the old guy?

247
00:13:23.735 --> 00:13:24.837
[Danny] The old guy?

248
00:13:26.873 --> 00:13:28.307
That was our teacher.

249
00:13:29.242 --> 00:13:30.344
We called him <i>"Sifu".</i>

250
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:33.479
- You know what that means?
- Mm-mm.


251
00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:36.215
Si means master.

252
00:13:36.248 --> 00:13:37.517
Fu means father.

253
00:13:39.484 --> 00:13:40.854
Can you show me <i>gung fu?</i>

254
00:13:42.287 --> 00:13:43.389
[Danny] What for?

255
00:13:44.623 --> 00:13:46.593
Listen, a lot of boneheads think

256
00:13:46.626 --> 00:13:48.461
they can solve everything
with their fists,


257
00:13:48.493 --> 00:13:50.296
like that guy back there, right?

258
00:13:51.263 --> 00:13:52.565
You know what to do?

259
00:13:52.599 --> 00:13:54.700
[Danny] You do what dad did,
you just be a bigger man


260
00:13:54.734 --> 00:13:55.735
and walk away.

261
00:13:57.604 --> 00:14:00.339
Hey, so what's the first thing
you wanna do in Magic Land, huh?


262
00:14:00.907 --> 00:14:02.908
Mount Splash!

263
00:14:02.941 --> 00:14:05.644
Mount Splash, that's right.

264
00:14:05.677 --> 00:14:08.214
Now we're gonna do that first
and then we're gonna do...


265
00:14:08.248 --> 00:14:10.849
- [Danny] Vanilla Chunky Pie!
- Vanilla Chunky Pie!


266
00:14:10.883 --> 00:14:12.352

Hello?

271
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.465
[Danny] Wait, what do you mean
it didn't go through?


272
00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:29.402
We, we had everything
signed for.


273
00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:31.938
I understand,
I'm on it right now.


274
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.006
[Danny] I give you my word
that it's gonna be fixed


275
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.310

to the office, yes.

[Hing] How can you forget?

296

I mean,
"Tiger pounces from cave!"

Fell off a scaffold at work

Shit, man.

Yeah, it was their busted
equipment anyways.

Out behind the restaurant.

I haven't seen the old man
in 15 years.


325
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.756
I'm lucky
I still found you here.


326
00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:38.692
Funeral's tomorrow.

327
00:17:39.792 --> 00:17:42.095
Yeah, yeah, of course.

328
00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:43.796
I'll drop Ed off with his mom.

329
00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:47.566
Should we tell Jim?

330
00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.706
I'm not going if he's going.

331
00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:00.212
[Danny] Hey, buddy.

332
00:18:00.246 --> 00:18:04.217
We're gonna go and do Magic Land
next weekend, okay?


333
00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:05.518
I swear.

334
00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:12.959
Buddy.

335
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:15.060
I need you to do me
one last thing.


336
00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.697
If your mom asks
about yesterday,


337
00:18:17.729 --> 00:18:20.033
tell her that we went to
Magic Land like we said we did.


338
00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.469
Isn't that lying?

339
00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:23.836
[Danny] Yes.

340
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.706
Yes, it is,
but it would hurt her even more


341
00:18:26.738 --> 00:18:29.241
if she found out
that we didn't go.


342
00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:32.545
She might not let us spend time
together anymore.


343
00:18:32.577 --> 00:18:33.680
Don't you wanna see me again?

344
00:18:35.515 --> 00:18:36.916

You wanted to be a part of this.

Danny, stop making me out
to be the bad guy.


356

- Yeah.

A great <i>gung fu master</i>

380
00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:28.661
It's a disgrace his disciples

I'm not fat, I'm bloated.

394
00:20:52.183 --> 00:20:53.619
We just had pasta.

That's right, breakfast pasta.

Cardiac arrhythmia.

there was no heart attack.

in a place where <i>gung fu</i>
is at least practiced.

Why not open your own school?

to teach them anything proper

- Take out the trash!

You can't do that,

- [Danny] We got this.

Um, I forgot the salute.

- What do you mean you forgot?

I don't quite remember
exactly what to do.

Now, honor your word.

890
00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:39.650
What was your relationship
with <i>Sifu Cheung?</i>


891
00:43:41.184 --> 00:43:42.420
I asked him once
if he'd teach us.


892
00:43:42.452 --> 00:43:43.755
What'd he say?

893
00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:45.556
He wasn't having it.

894
00:43:45.590 --> 00:43:48.193
He swore he'd never teach anyone
anything anymore.


895
00:43:48.226 --> 00:43:51.195
[Chief] He was always screaming
about ungrateful disciples.


896
00:43:51.228 --> 00:43:54.765
He slammed a butcher knife
onto the block and broke it.


897
00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.300
<i>Sifu was always good to me.</i>

898
00:43:57.735 --> 00:44:00.005
We'd never do anything
to hurt him.


899
00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:01.673
Delete all the photos
you took at the funeral.


900
00:44:01.706 --> 00:44:03.240
[Danny] All of it.

901
00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:05.042
I don't want anyone
getting the wrong idea.


902
00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:10.449
We might be a disgrace,

903
00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:15.153
but <i>Sifu</i>
had only three disciples.


904
00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:19.123
Hey, yo, man, sorry,
I called you nig...


905
00:44:20.358 --> 00:44:21.493
the N-word.

906
00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:31.503
[Hing] <i>I found it.</i>

907
00:44:31.536 --> 00:44:35.139
Right behind
your gonorrhea pills.


908
00:44:36.673 --> 00:44:38.275
Oh.

909
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:39.544
[Danny] Is it still good?

910
00:44:39.577 --> 00:44:41.312
- [Hing] Yeah, it's good.
- Oh, man.


911
00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:43.148
The longer the Jow ferments,
the better.


912
00:44:43.181 --> 00:44:44.081
Rub me down then, nurse.

913
00:44:44.115 --> 00:44:46.717
My god, you still believe
in that stuff?


914
00:44:46.751 --> 00:44:48.386
Mm.

915
00:44:48.418 --> 00:44:49.420
I'll be good to go.

916
00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:52.824
Aah, in the morning.

917
00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:54.492
Yeah, well, I'm good to go now.

918
00:44:55.726 --> 00:44:57.429
Somebody had to carry the team.

919
00:44:57.461 --> 00:44:58.630
You mean we had to

920
00:44:58.662 --> 00:45:00.331
- carry the team.
- Okay.


921
00:45:00.363 --> 00:45:01.699
[chuckles]
I'll drink to that.


922
00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.170
I bet you Carter knew

923
00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:07.338
the whole time
those kids were a bust.


924
00:45:07.371 --> 00:45:09.307
We should get to <i>Sifu Wong's</i>
early tomorrow,


925
00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.842
see if he's heard anything new.

926
00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:13.378
We would have killed those kids
in our prime.


927
00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:14.479
It's weird.

928
00:45:16.414 --> 00:45:19.084
It's like I could feel
what I needed to do.


929
00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:23.654
Where to move, but like...

930
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:26.825
my body wouldn't listen.

931
00:45:26.858 --> 00:45:28.392
Getting old, my man.

932
00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:29.693
[Jim] Body's slowing down.

933
00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:31.095
<i>Sifu never slowed down.</i>

934
00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:32.630
<i>Sifu's not everybody.</i>

935
00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:37.701
None of us
could touch him, ever.


936
00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:39.738
Well, that's 'cause
<i>Sifu was fast.</i>


937
00:45:41.639 --> 00:45:43.407
I wasn't fast, I was first.

938
00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:47.311
- Same thing.
- Same thing, right?


939
00:45:47.345 --> 00:45:48.480
No.

940
00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.183
You remember doing meditations?

941
00:45:53.383 --> 00:45:55.686
When I had it just right,

942
00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:59.591
I was the most relaxed
I'd ever been.


943
00:45:59.624 --> 00:46:03.695
I could feel
the color in the grass.


944
00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:05.897
[Danny] It was intense.

945
00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:08.632
So anytime we went to <i>beimo</i>

946
00:46:08.666 --> 00:46:11.269
when I had my breathing down
just right,


947
00:46:11.302 --> 00:46:13.137
I could get the world
to slow down.


948
00:46:14.572 --> 00:46:17.842
I, I mean, I could feel
the other guy's muscles


949
00:46:17.874 --> 00:46:22.313
tensing up long before
he even would try to punch.


950
00:46:22.345 --> 00:46:24.849
[Danny] That's how I would
always hit first.


951
00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:27.652
I knew what the other guy
was going to do


952
00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:29.286
before he even thought of it.

953
00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.287
What?

954
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:33.190
No, no, there's...
there's something to that.


955
00:46:33.224 --> 00:46:35.392
It's like when I fell off
the scaffold.


956
00:46:35.425 --> 00:46:37.461
I mean it was only
ten feet high, but...


957
00:46:38.528 --> 00:46:39.697
it seemed like

958
00:46:39.729 --> 00:46:43.168
it was the longest time before
I actually hit the ground.


959
00:46:45.769 --> 00:46:47.871
It was a trip.

960
00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:50.307
Think you could have pulled that
on <i>Sifu?</i>


961
00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.409
Oh, jeez.

962
00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:53.612
[Jim and Hing laughing]

963
00:47:06.423 --> 00:47:10.460
You know, if you would have
came with us to Japan,


964
00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:15.200
maybe you could have talked
some sense into Dai Si-Hing.


965
00:47:15.233 --> 00:47:17.468
I couldn't leave <i>Sifu alone</i>
like that.


966
00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:18.769
Teacher's pet, huh?

967
00:47:21.005 --> 00:47:22.707
We were all equally his sons.

968
00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:25.877
No, no, you were definitely
his favorites.


969
00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.678
Dai Si-Hing,
he inherits the clan.


970
00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:29.414
You? You learned how to heal.

971
00:47:29.447 --> 00:47:31.382
What do I get?

972
00:47:31.414 --> 00:47:32.650
You get to eat the chicken.

973
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.253
I'mma forget that.

974
00:47:35.286 --> 00:47:37.354
I'mma forget that you said that.

975
00:47:37.387 --> 00:47:38.456
[laughs]

976
00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:41.760
[groans]

977
00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:47.431
What?

978
00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:52.703
Did he teach you poison fingers?

979
00:47:52.737 --> 00:47:54.639
[chuckles]
Come on, man.


980
00:47:54.671 --> 00:47:58.775
"You want to learn
poison finger, you work hard...


981
00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:01.345
- for 20 more years!"
- "For 20 more years!"


982
00:48:01.378 --> 00:48:02.846
[both laugh]

983
00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.349
Yeah.

984
00:48:04.382 --> 00:48:05.416
[clears throat]

985
00:48:08.019 --> 00:48:09.254
No.

986
00:48:11.722 --> 00:48:12.924
After you two left,

987
00:48:12.956 --> 00:48:14.758
old man lost his heart
for fighting.


988
00:48:15.925 --> 00:48:17.394
So all we did was medicine.

989
00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.438
Do you think the poison fingers
is real?


990
00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:31.942
Every good <i>gung fu man</i>
keeps a secret.


991
00:48:56.499 --> 00:48:58.302
[exhales]

992
00:49:00.838 --> 00:49:04.508
[breathes deeply]

993
00:49:09.045 --> 00:49:11.415
[Jim]
<i>Imagine if we all stayed...</i>


994
00:49:11.449 --> 00:49:13.418
cooped up in that garage...

995
00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:14.619
[laughs]

996
00:49:14.652 --> 00:49:18.056
With the old man sitting over
in the corner and smoking,


997
00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:20.592
watching horse racing.

998
00:49:22.525 --> 00:49:25.329
When we gather up all the kids
in the neighborhood and teach...


999
00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.068
for free.

1000
00:49:32.836 --> 00:49:33.938
Is that so bad?

1001
00:49:35.905 --> 00:49:37.574
Well, you gotta eat.

1002
00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:40.645
You gotta pay rent.

1003
00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:43.081
Yeah.

1004
00:49:45.949 --> 00:49:48.652
When the old folks in Chinatown
couldn't afford treatment,


1005
00:49:49.586 --> 00:49:50.688
<i>Sifu would offer to do</i>

1006
00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.657
free clinics for them
on the weekends.


1007
00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.392
Because it was
"honorable and righteous".


1008
00:49:55.425 --> 00:49:56.728
Yeah, "righteous".

1009
00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:57.894
Guess who he expected

1010
00:49:57.927 --> 00:49:59.529
to come out to work
for free, too?


1011
00:49:59.563 --> 00:50:00.865
[laughs]

1012
00:50:00.898 --> 00:50:01.932
Of course.

1013
00:50:03.032 --> 00:50:04.701
Man, I'll be honest.

1014
00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:06.637
I mean I was doing
hotel security back then,


1015
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.374
I mean I was getting paid,
it's good money.


1016
00:50:09.407 --> 00:50:12.110
So taking a day off from work
for a bunch of senior citizens


1017
00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:15.479
that can only repay you
with flowers and vegetables,


1018
00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.114
I mean that's nice,
but you know.


1019
00:50:19.916 --> 00:50:22.052
That day that <i>Sifu needed me,</i>

1020
00:50:23.787 --> 00:50:25.023
I didn't say anything to him.

1021
00:50:26.624 --> 00:50:27.959
I'd just go to my hotel job.

1022
00:50:31.195 --> 00:50:34.099
Funny thing is,
he doesn't call me.


1023
00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:36.835
He doesn't come looking for me.

1024
00:50:39.068 --> 00:50:42.005
A week rolls by,
I still don't hear from him.


1025
00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:43.574
So now I don't know
what to expect.


1026
00:50:43.606 --> 00:50:46.110
I mean, is he mad? Depressed?

1027
00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.447
He already lost you two, right?

1028
00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:54.652
But...

1029
00:50:57.454 --> 00:50:59.090
I never got up the courage...

1030
00:51:01.025 --> 00:51:02.460
to show my face

1031
00:51:05.028 --> 00:51:08.032
and just man up
and say I'm sorry.


1032
00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:17.609
Now, <i>Sifu dies all alone</i>
in a goddam alley.


1033
00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:22.947
Can't put that
all on yourself, man.


1034
00:51:24.914 --> 00:51:28.085
<i>Gung fu means</i>
nothing without your word.


1035
00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:32.157
I mean if we promise
to do something...


1036
00:51:34.958 --> 00:51:37.528
we better do it, right?

1037
00:51:40.764 --> 00:51:41.966

00:52:40.824 --> 00:52:42.693
Yeah, let's go.

00:52:48.831 --> 00:52:51.802
[background chatter]

1047
00:52:58.242 --> 00:52:59.878
[Carter] Ah, shit. Oh, shit.

1048
00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:02.146
Ah!

1049
00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:05.316
<i>The Three Tigers of Sifu Cheung</i>
finally back together.


1050
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:06.684
Is <i>Sifu Wong in?</i>

1051
00:53:06.717 --> 00:53:08.219
Oh, he just stepped out
for a walk.


1052
00:53:08.251 --> 00:53:09.554
Should be back soon though.

1053
00:53:09.586 --> 00:53:10.954
You're more than welcome
to come in.


1054
00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:12.589
Have some tea while you wait?

1055
00:53:12.623 --> 00:53:13.925
Tea?

1056
00:53:13.958 --> 00:53:15.593
You won't wanna fight
or nothing, huh?


1057
00:53:15.626 --> 00:53:16.661
No.

1058
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:22.032
Danny Four Feet.

1059
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:28.106
Anybody smell Rogaine?

1060
00:53:31.809 --> 00:53:32.977
[man] I remember
picking these leaves


1061
00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:35.345
from the Tian Shan
mountain range.


1062
00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:36.681
Plucked 'em from the top.

1063
00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.650
[indistinct chatter]

1064
00:53:50.159 --> 00:53:51.194
Heard about yesterday.

1065
00:53:53.931 --> 00:53:55.900
Tough times
for Danny Eight Hands.


1066
00:53:58.369 --> 00:53:59.704
How did you hear about that?

1067
00:53:59.737 --> 00:54:02.139
Nobody gossips like the Chinese.

1068
00:54:02.171 --> 00:54:04.074
Oh, no, no, it's online.

1069
00:54:04.108 --> 00:54:06.210
Yeah, the kids put up
a play-by-play and everything.


1070
00:54:07.878 --> 00:54:09.247
[Carter] You're internet famous.

1071
00:54:11.115 --> 00:54:12.650
Son of a bitch.

1072
00:54:13.816 --> 00:54:15.786
Oh, forgot to like it.

1073
00:54:15.818 --> 00:54:18.389
Yeah, but what do you expect
these days?


1074
00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:20.324
Nobody cares about
the code of <i>beimo anymore.</i>


1075
00:54:20.356 --> 00:54:22.826
Used to be about respect.

1076
00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:24.228
You'd fight,
and no matter who won...


1077
00:54:25.662 --> 00:54:27.231
nobody talked about it
afterward.


1078
00:54:27.264 --> 00:54:30.233
Carter, those kids had no idea
how <i>Sifu died.</i>


1079
00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:32.769
Well, it was worth a shot,
right?


1080
00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:34.003
[Carter chuckles]

1081
00:54:34.037 --> 00:54:37.340
Actually, for you, more like
five straight shots to the head.


1082
00:54:37.374 --> 00:54:38.409
[Carter] Definitely worth it.

1083
00:54:38.441 --> 00:54:42.746
So you knew it was
a dead end, huh? You set us up.


1084
00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:45.216
No, I didn't know
what they knew.


1085
00:54:45.249 --> 00:54:46.951
Just thought it'd be
a better bet for them


1086
00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:49.953
to face off against you,
the great Three Tigers.


1087
00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.688
[sighs]

1088
00:54:51.722 --> 00:54:53.357
[Carter] Well, the old you.

1089
00:54:53.389 --> 00:54:56.860
Then again the now you
is the old you.


1090
00:54:58.762 --> 00:55:00.765
Or is it the lesser you?

1091
00:55:00.798 --> 00:55:02.233
Anything else you figured out?

1092
00:55:04.802 --> 00:55:06.804
- I got a couple of ideas.
- And?


1093
00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:08.373
[chuckles]
So sad.


1094
00:55:09.273 --> 00:55:11.008
A toast!

1095
00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:13.077
To the once great
Danny Eight Hands.


1096
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:14.077
- I...
- What are you doing?


1097
00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:16.112
- I didn't know he'll say that.
- Put it down.


1098
00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:18.115
Time sure catches up
to some people.


1099
00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:20.117
And it doesn't change a thing
for others.


1100
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:22.153
I think I might have changed
just a little bit.


1101
00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.022
[hisses, groans]

1102
00:55:24.722 --> 00:55:25.923
Not like you.

[groaning]

1105
00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:31.028
At least it's natural.

1106
00:55:31.061 --> 00:55:33.264
We'll look for <i>Sifu Wong</i>
when he gets back.


1107
00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.298
You want a theory?

1108
00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:37.734
- Okay, here we go.
- No, no, not really.


1109
00:55:37.767 --> 00:55:40.438
How about your <i>Sifu took on</i>
another disciple?


1110
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:42.873
- [chuckles]
- We're his only sworn disciples.


1111
00:55:42.905 --> 00:55:44.007
I was with him last.

1112
00:55:44.041 --> 00:55:46.110
Yeah, 15 years ago?

1113
00:55:46.142 --> 00:55:47.744
Plenty of time
to raise somebody new.


1114
00:55:47.778 --> 00:55:49.013
Who is it then?

1115

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:26.457
[sighs]

1282
01:05:28.525 --> 01:05:30.626
Last winter,
I received a challenge letter.


1283
01:05:30.659 --> 01:05:33.062
[Carter] Wanted to fight me here
at the school.


1284
01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.731
He'd already been around
to the other masters and...


1285
01:05:35.764 --> 01:05:37.433
he'd beaten them all bad.

1286
01:05:37.467 --> 01:05:38.869
Did you win?

1287
01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:41.704
[laughs]

1288
01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:43.440
You got your butt kicked,
didn't you?


1289
01:05:43.472 --> 01:05:44.574
I didn't lose!

1290
01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:48.545
I didn't win either.

1291
01:05:50.045 --> 01:05:51.480
When he was on his way here,

1292
01:05:51.514 --> 01:05:54.617
I locked up the school,
turned out the lights.


1293
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.286
Stayed up here until he left.

1294
01:05:57.987 --> 01:06:00.657
Your <i>Sifu came over</i>
to personally apologize.


1295
01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:06.363
Said his disciple was
totally out of control.


1296
01:06:06.396 --> 01:06:09.667
He actually said that,
"his disciple"?


1297
01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.537
Where can we find this guy?

1298
01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:14.905
Try the Dungeon.

1299
01:06:14.938 --> 01:06:16.106
His type might hang out there.

1300
01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:17.606
The Dungeon?

1301
01:06:17.639 --> 01:06:19.542
- You know this?
- [Jim] Oh, yeah.


1302
01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:21.644
They say it's a mob front.

1303
01:06:21.677 --> 01:06:24.613
Bunch of journeymen who do
enforcer work on the side.


1304
01:06:24.646 --> 01:06:26.816
This guy turned his back
on your <i>Sifu,</i>


1305
01:06:26.849 --> 01:06:29.353
got mixed up with the Triads.

1306
01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:32.355
<i>Sifu Cheung swore he would</i>
take back his <i>gung fu.</i>


1307
01:06:32.389 --> 01:06:33.490
You're saying they fought?

1308
01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.527
How'd <i>Sifu lose?</i>

1309
01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:41.065
Oh, come on.

1310
01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:45.101
Oh!

1311
01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.137
My head's killing me.

1312
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:50.439
[Hing] Could be.

1313
01:06:50.472 --> 01:06:53.509
You did get knocked out twice
in one day.


1314
01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:56.079
All that blood pressure
squeezing your brain


1315
01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:57.847
against your skull.

1316
01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.949
It's what killed Bruce Lee.

1317
01:07:01.016 --> 01:07:02.018
[laughs]

1318
01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:05.722
Oh, there you go.

1319
01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:06.957
Oh.

1320
01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:09.426
- Mm-mm.
- Trust me, it works.

[Hing] Really?

1328

The holy grail.

1329
01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.452
[Hing] Yes!

1330

<i>Why are we here?</i>

1331
01:07:41.858 --> 01:07:43.961
<i>Oh, Carter always loses.</i>

1332
01:07:45.028 --> 01:07:47.030
This is when you put it on him.

1333
01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:48.965
You dismantled him this time,
I remember this.


1334

I still can't believe
he just waxed all our asses.

- Hey, table's not free.

Okay, then we'll have some tea.

Never.

You never looked back either.

But at least <i>Sifu tried.</i>

Never get in a ring unless

No one here can, so...

Ah Hing, let me take you home.

1592
01:21:44.932 --> 01:21:46.002

Hey, stop!
Hey, just get outta here!

Get outta here!

1602
01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:30.912
Whoa, okay, okay, you're okay,
you're okay, you're okay.


1603
01:22:30.945 --> 01:22:32.014
Stand up, stand up.

1604
01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:34.717
Let me see.
Let me see your face.


1605
01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:38.587
Oh, it's okay.
Let me get your backpack.


1606
01:22:38.619 --> 01:22:39.622
You all right?

1607
01:22:41.457 --> 01:22:42.758
And who were those kids?

1608
01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:49.932
[background chatter]

1609
01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:53.935
Next time, don't get in a fight
with a future linebacker, okay?


1610
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.505
That guy was 12?

1611
01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:57.607
Jeez.

1612
01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:00.710
You're lucky it's not broken.

1613
01:23:00.743 --> 01:23:02.578
What happened to your face?

1614
01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:03.779
Oh, what, this?

1615
01:23:05.547 --> 01:23:07.750
I ran into a door.

1616
01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:11.053
You know how I tell you
not to run around the house?


1617
01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:12.655
Well, there's a good reason
for that.


1618
01:23:15.823 --> 01:23:18.027
So...

1619
01:23:18.060 --> 01:23:19.796
how do you think
we should tell your mother?


1620
01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:21.963
Hmm?

1621
01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:25.800
- Do we have to?
- Mm-hm.


1622
01:23:25.833 --> 01:23:26.836
Honor your mother.

1623
01:23:28.170 --> 01:23:30.806
But we told mom
we went to Magic Land.


1624
01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:36.378
Well, this is not the same
as Magic Land.


1625
01:23:36.412 --> 01:23:39.515
And we didn't tell her
'cause it would hurt her.


1626
01:23:39.547 --> 01:23:41.617
- That's what you said, right?
- No, that's not it.


1627
01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:44.820
So I wouldn't get in trouble
and I could see you again?


1628
01:23:45.953 --> 01:23:46.988
That... that...

1629
01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.624
This is completely different.

1630
01:23:49.658 --> 01:23:51.460
Besides, that's not what
I was trying to...


1631

[sighs]

1632
01:23:57.498 --> 01:23:58.533
Okay.

1633
01:23:59.967 --> 01:24:01.836
Buddy, we have to tell
your mother about this,


1634
01:24:01.869 --> 01:24:02.939
all right?

1635
01:24:06.707 --> 01:24:09.112
- Is it ever okay to fight?
- No.


1636
01:24:14.582 --> 01:24:16.017
And if it happens to you...

1637
01:24:17.453 --> 01:24:18.654
you gotta go find a teacher.

1638
01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:21.591
What if there is no teacher?

1639
01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:23.959
Then you walk away.

1640
01:24:23.992 --> 01:24:25.628
What if he hits your friend?

1641
01:24:25.661 --> 01:24:26.996
Then you both have to walk away.

1642
01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:31.601
But he...

1643
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:37.707
Doesn't stop,
calls your friend a faggot,


1644
01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:42.211
and punches him every day.

1645
01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:45.113
Well, that sounds like something
they need to settle

between themselves
as grown children.

You said I couldn't learn
any <i>gung fu.</i>


1648
01:24:54.689 --> 01:24:57.725
[Ed] I asked you
and you wouldn't teach me.


1649
01:24:57.758 --> 01:25:00.430
I can't just let them hurt
my friend like that, right, Dad?

Don't we have something
to tell your mother?

[Caryn] Always walk away, Ed.

I don't care who
or what started it.

Ellsworth is one of the
best schools in the state.

to get you there.

We cannot let this ruin
your future.

[Danny] No, wait.

I don't think we should be
that hard on him.


1674
01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:35.891
I mean, he could have lied
to you about it, but he didn't.


1675
01:26:35.923 --> 01:26:37.993
The most important thing
is that he told you the truth.


1676
01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:39.929
Is that so?

1677
01:26:39.962 --> 01:26:41.964
Yeah, I mean,
he's learning self-respect.

do last weekend?


1681
01:26:53.874 --> 01:26:56.811
[Caryn] Well, he said that you
took him to Magic Land.


1682
01:26:56.845 --> 01:26:59.315
You know, like you said
and... and promised to do.


1683
01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:01.316
Yeah, yeah. We, we...

1684
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:03.284
We headed out there

1685
01:27:03.318 --> 01:27:05.320
as soon as I picked him up
and, you know,


1686
01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:08.691
we went to grab a few burgers
for the road


1687
01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:09.758
and we just, uh...

[sighs]

1690
01:27:18.065 --> 01:27:20.269
I had to take care
of something at work.


1691
01:27:21.837 --> 01:27:23.806
It was a big deadline and, uh...

1692
01:27:25.774 --> 01:27:28.142
we didn't make it to Magic Land.

1693
01:27:28.176 --> 01:27:30.980
Then why would Ed say
that you did?


1694
01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:33.082
Because I made him promise
to tell you.


1695
01:27:35.182 --> 01:27:36.319
Ed, I'm...

1696
01:27:38.353 --> 01:27:41.323
That was very selfish of me.

1697
01:27:41.355 --> 01:27:44.859
It's wrong to lie to your mother
and I...


1698
01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:46.695
I shouldn't have made you
do it for me.


1699
01:27:48.063 --> 01:27:49.931
Okay, Ed, get yourself to bed.

1700
01:27:49.965 --> 01:27:52.001
We'll talk about
your punishment tomorrow.


1701
01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:52.867
For defending his friend?

1702
01:27:52.902 --> 01:27:55.136
No, he doesn't deserve
to be punished.


1703
01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:56.238
It's late.

1704
01:27:59.306 --> 01:28:01.676
Yeah, she's right, it's late.

you really swing, don't you?

1709
01:28:19.094 --> 01:28:21.363
Does everything have to be
a fight with you?

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:57.920
Like I wasn't holding up my end
of the bargain.


1745
01:31:00.355 --> 01:31:01.390
Look, I just...

1746
01:31:02.591 --> 01:31:04.260
I wanted to keep up with you.

1747
01:31:05.426 --> 01:31:06.528
But the truth is,

1748
01:31:08.230 --> 01:31:10.533
you're much better
at being a mom...


1749
01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:14.537
and a father.

1750
01:31:17.471 --> 01:31:19.507
Whatever custody you think
is best,


1751
01:31:19.541 --> 01:31:22.344
if it's 20/80 or...

1752
01:31:25.313 --> 01:31:26.849
Or full custody.

1753
01:31:29.117 --> 01:31:30.119
I'll sign it.

1754
01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:36.057
All I ask is that I get to say
goodnight to my son tonight.


1755
01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:40.563
[Carter] <i>Two minutes tonight,
tomorrow we talk.</i>


1756
01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:45.133
Ed? Hey, buddy!

1757
01:31:46.066 --> 01:31:47.136
How you doing?

1758
01:31:47.601 --> 01:31:49.938
Good.

1759
01:31:49.971 --> 01:31:52.575
I just wanted to call
to let you know...


1760
01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:54.542
first...

1761
01:31:54.575 --> 01:31:55.578
[sighs]

1762
01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:57.979
...goodnight.

1763
01:31:58.012 --> 01:32:00.114
[Danny] <i>And if I could give you
a hug right now,</i>


1764
01:32:00.148 --> 01:32:02.050
<i>I would give you
the biggest hug.</i>


1765
01:32:02.082 --> 01:32:04.219
And, uh, what I wanted
to say was that


1766
01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:06.288
I'm really proud of you, Ed.

1767
01:32:09.024 --> 01:32:10.960
I'm so glad that you stood up
for your friend.


1768
01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:14.363
That takes real guts.

1769
01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:16.532
And that it's okay.

1770
01:32:18.999 --> 01:32:21.302
If there's no other way out.

1771
01:32:21.336 --> 01:32:24.338
[Danny] <i>If you have to fight,
that's the right thing to do,</i>


1772
01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:26.508
<i>but don't go looking
for it, okay?</i>


1773
01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:27.642
You understand?

1774
01:32:29.077 --> 01:32:30.512
Because if you go looking
for a fight,


1775
01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:31.646
that makes you the bully.

1776
01:32:34.114 --> 01:32:35.550
[Danny]
<i>I want you to hold up your hand.</i>


1777
01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:40.087
Okay?

1778
01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:42.490
Now I want you to curl
the very tips of your fingers


1779
01:32:42.524 --> 01:32:44.559
and squeeze down

1780
01:32:44.591 --> 01:32:47.429
<i>so that your fingertips
are digging into your palm.</i>


1781
01:32:47.462 --> 01:32:50.198
[Danny] <i>Squeeze really hard.</i>

1782
01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:53.434
Now put your thumb down
over your fingers.


1783
01:32:53.467 --> 01:32:55.336
[Danny] <i>No sticking out, okay?</i>

1784
01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:58.239
<i>You can't have your thumb
sticking out or you'll break it.</i>


1785
01:32:58.273 --> 01:33:01.176
Now point it to the light
and look through your hand


1786
01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:03.045
like it's a telescope.

1787
01:33:03.078 --> 01:33:04.680
[Danny] <i>Can you see through it?</i>

1788
01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:06.648
<i>Any light coming through
your fingers?</i>


1789
01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:09.150
- Yeah.
- [Danny] <i>All right.</i>


1790
01:33:09.184 --> 01:33:11.619
<i>That means you're not
squeezing hard enough, son.</i>


1791
01:33:11.653 --> 01:33:13.387
<i>You gotta squeeze really hard</i>

1792
01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:15.490
<i>so that there's no more light
coming through the holes.</i>


1793
01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:18.994
- <i>You got it?</i>
- Yeah.


1794
01:33:19.027 --> 01:33:21.296
[Danny] <i>Okay, that's how
you make a fist.</i>


1795
01:33:21.328 --> 01:33:25.233
From now on, if anyone ever lays
a hand on you,


1796
01:33:26.467 --> 01:33:29.637
touches your mother
or anyone you love,


1797
01:33:31.506 --> 01:33:36.043
son, I want you to squeeze
as hard as you can.


1798
01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:40.315
[Danny] <i>And you smash that fist
right in their face.</i>


1799
01:33:40.347 --> 01:33:42.383
[intense music]

1800
01:33:53.028 --> 01:33:54.096
[Danny sighs]

1801
01:33:57.431 --> 01:34:00.068
I'm the senior disciple
of <i>Sifu Cheung.</i>


1802
01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:01.635
<i>Beimo.</i>

1803
01:34:01.668 --> 01:34:03.305
Best of three rounds.

1804
01:34:03.337 --> 01:34:04.538
Three minutes each.

1805
01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:06.440
First round, you attack.

1806
01:34:06.474 --> 01:34:07.575
Second round, I attack.

1807
01:34:07.609 --> 01:34:09.044
[Zhen Fan] Knockout wins it all.

1808
01:34:09.077 --> 01:34:10.779
Suppose you make it
to the third round?


1809
01:34:10.811 --> 01:34:12.613
If you make it
to the third round?


1810
01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.483
Free fight.

1811
01:34:15.516 --> 01:34:17.152
Winner throws the loser
off the roof.


1812
01:34:18.252 --> 01:34:21.389
If I win... you both go.

1813
01:34:24.258 --> 01:34:26.293
- Fine.
- What?


1814
01:34:26.327 --> 01:34:28.063
Um, wait a minute.

1815
01:34:29.631 --> 01:34:32.100
I'm not gonna let him
throw us off, that's crazy!


1816
01:34:32.132 --> 01:34:33.769
Let me land first
and I'll cushion your fall.


1817
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:38.407
[chuckles]
Okay, Danny Eight Hands.


1818
01:34:38.439 --> 01:34:41.509
[Jim] Listen,
round one's gotta be all you.


1819
01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:43.210
Because if we're being honest,

1820
01:34:43.243 --> 01:34:44.412
it's the only chance
you got to hurt him,


1821
01:34:44.445 --> 01:34:46.381
so you gotta hit him
with bad intentions.


1822
01:34:46.413 --> 01:34:47.514
Right.

1823
01:34:47.548 --> 01:34:50.318
[Jim] Up, up, down, down,
left, right, left, right,


1824
01:34:50.350 --> 01:34:52.220
Ba-ba! Start in on him!

1825
01:34:57.358 --> 01:35:00.395
Yeah, you... you gotta kill him
before he kills you.


1826
01:35:00.427 --> 01:35:01.729
Before he kills us.

1827
01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:04.133
Us.

1828
01:35:07.402 --> 01:35:09.337
- [exhales]
- [Jim] You got this.


1829
01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:13.140
You keep time.

1830
01:35:13.173 --> 01:35:14.575
You trust me?

1831
01:35:14.609 --> 01:35:15.711
All family here.

1832
01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:21.449
Y'all ready?

1833
01:35:21.483 --> 01:35:23.284
- [beeps]
- [Jim] Go!

[both grunting]

I... I can't breathe,
I can't breathe.


1839
01:35:53.614 --> 01:35:55.749
- [Danny] Uh, it's burning!
- Dude, what ya doing?


1840
01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:56.785
What's the time?

1841
01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:00.789
Uh, man, you're killing it, bro!

1842
01:36:00.822 --> 01:36:02.157
Doing great!

1843
01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:03.624
Just go! Go!

- [pants]
- Danny.


1845

[Jim] Go, hurry!

1846
01:36:07.194 --> 01:36:08.197
Shit.

- [Jim] What are you doing again?


1855
01:36:32.619 --> 01:36:34.722
You still got two minutes.

1856
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:38.292
[spits]
[Jim] Danny!


1857
01:36:38.325 --> 01:36:39.426
- [Jim] Danny!
- Okay.


1858
01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:40.694
[Jim] Keep fighting, dammit.

1859
01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:42.497
This is your only chance.

1860

- Okay.
- Let's go, get up!

- [Zhen Fan] Get up!
- Take... take your time, man.

[alarm beeps]

1866
01:37:17.564 --> 01:37:18.899
Time, time, time!

1867
01:37:18.932 --> 01:37:20.903
[sighs]

1868
01:37:21.668 --> 01:37:22.903
One minute break.

1869
01:37:22.936 --> 01:37:24.273
Whose round was that?

1870
01:37:25.974 --> 01:37:27.309
He hit me, right?

1871
01:37:28.775 --> 01:37:30.778
- You can have it.
- Uh!


1872

[pants]

1873
01:37:32.381 --> 01:37:34.483
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.


1874
01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:38.720
[breathes deeply]

1875
01:37:40.387 --> 01:37:41.823
I felt something crack.

1876
01:37:41.855 --> 01:37:43.925
Even if I get
to the third round,


1877
01:37:45.292 --> 01:37:46.493
I can't do anything to him.

1878
01:37:46.528 --> 01:37:49.297
I want you to stop worrying
about that. I need you to focus.


1879
01:37:49.329 --> 01:37:50.564
Focus on this second round

1880
01:37:50.597 --> 01:37:52.234
'cause he's gonna bring it
to you now.


1881
01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:55.470
I'm sorry.

1882
01:37:56.637 --> 01:37:57.672
It's okay.

1883
01:37:58.939 --> 01:38:00.274
We're here now, right?

1884
01:38:02.277 --> 01:38:04.279
I can't beat him.

1885
01:38:04.311 --> 01:38:05.947
- I can't beat him.
- Hey!


1886
01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:07.549
If you believe
you're gonna lose,


1887
01:38:07.582 --> 01:38:09.751
then you've already lost.

1888
01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:11.853
I need you to believe
in yourself, okay?


1889
01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:14.856
I need you to believe
you can beat him.


1890
01:38:14.889 --> 01:38:15.923
Now say it.

1891
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:18.025
- I believe I can beat him.
- No,


1892
01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:19.528
say it like you mean it, Danny.

1893
01:38:21.561 --> 01:38:23.998
- I believe I can beat him.
- Come on.


1894
01:38:24.032 --> 01:38:25.266
I believe I can beat him.

1895
01:38:25.300 --> 01:38:28.036
- Say it! Come on, Danny! Yes.
- I believe! I could beat him.


1896
01:38:28.069 --> 01:38:29.738
- I believe I could beat him.
- Come on now!


1897
01:38:29.770 --> 01:38:30.871
- I believe...
- Let's go!


1898
01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:33.574
[grunts]

1899
