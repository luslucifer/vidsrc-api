00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.645
Nick. I'm telling
you, I'm telling you this story-


2
00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:17.729
It's gonna be big-it's
going to put me on the map.


3
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.439
It's going to get national attention.

4
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.526
And it's going to land me a job
in a real market.


5
00:00:21.568 --> 00:00:25.655
I didn't move from Nebraska to live in
some rinkie-dink Texas town forever. Okay?


6
00:00:25.738 --> 00:00:30.118
I'm talking about a market
like Fort Worth or Chattanooga. Okay.


7
00:00:30.702 --> 00:00:34.538
You'll see. Great, we should probably
show some respect, though.


8
00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.957
I mean, people died here right?

9
00:00:36.958 --> 00:00:39.877
People die everywhere all the time.

10
00:00:39.878 --> 00:00:42.629
Okay? How do I look?

11
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.883
You look great, Ty. Let's go.

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.093
Yeah, I do look good.

13
00:00:48.428 --> 00:00:50.596
As you can see, I am standing
in front of this now


14
00:00:50.597 --> 00:00:54.225
infamous Texas home, the site of Marie
Strobeck's harrowing escape


15
00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:56.519
from a couple with a taste for blood.

16
00:00:56.978 --> 00:01:00.982
As was previously reported, the wife
and the couple was killed in the escape.


17
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:03.985
I kinda fucked that up.
Just take it from the top.


18
00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:07.112
As you can see, I'm
standing in front of this now


19
00:01:07.113 --> 00:01:10.199
infamous Texas home,
the site of Marie Strobeck's


20
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.911
harrowing escape
from a couple with a taste for blood.


21
00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:17.664
As was previously reported, the wife of
the duo was killed in the escape attempt.


22
00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:20.709
However, the father
and a young son of the duo still remain


23
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.087
at large. As police begin
digging in the back of the property.


24
00:01:24.088 --> 00:01:27.634
It is becoming apparent that Marie was not
the first person to fall capture to the duo.


25
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:31.220
If you have any information
as to the whereabouts of the father


26
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:34.224
or the son, we ask you to
please come forward to the authorities.


27
00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:37.727
Until then, we will keep
you updated on this developing story.

Maybe an hour. 
Hour and a half.

What's wrong? Well we don't have a spare,
so we're just going to have to

How someone from over there,
they can probably help us out.


43
00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.349
Yeah, I guess.

I don't know about this place.
Huh?


46
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.661
I don't feel good about this place.

47
00:04:19.597 --> 00:04:20.681
Why? What's wrong?

48
00:04:21.557 --> 00:04:23.935
I don't know. It's just-
I just have a feeling.


49
00:04:29.023 --> 00:04:30.941
I'm sure we'll be
out of here right away.

50
00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:33.703
If you want to wait in the car,
you can, but we'll just be in and out.


51
00:04:34.904 --> 00:04:36.656
No. That's okay-

52
00:04:36.697 --> 00:04:39.699
Hey. You got me here. Okay?

53
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.202
You've got nothing to worry about.

54
00:04:54.006 --> 00:04:57.260
Hello. It's getting a little wet out here.

55
00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:04.267
Well, should we just
head back to the car?

How can I help y'all?

57
00:05:05.977 --> 00:05:10.105
Um, yeah. Our car just broke down,
just down the road,


58
00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:12.346
and we're just wondering
if you would help us out at all.


59
00:05:13.359 --> 00:05:15.944
Ah well
-I'd be happy to.

60
00:05:15.945 --> 00:05:16.779
I could take a look.

61
00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.491
And if I can't help, maybe
we can just make a quick call in the town.


62
00:05:20.575 --> 00:05:22.033
Get a tow out here.

63
00:05:22.034 --> 00:05:24.453
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

64
00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:27.414
Maybe I can get you all some drinks.
I just made some lemonade


65
00:05:27.415 --> 00:05:30.001
and I'd be a terrible host if
I didn't offer you some.


66
00:05:30.293 --> 00:05:32.462
I could go for some lemonade.
That's great.


67
00:05:33.254 --> 00:05:34.464
Well, come on in.

68
00:05:35.798 --> 00:05:40.386
Maybe-maybe I should wait by the car
in case someone drives by.


69
00:05:41.304 --> 00:05:44.140
Ah-don't be ridiculous,
it's much more comfortable in here,

Sound about right so far?

00:13:56.215 --> 00:13:59.176
You said something about five figures.

00:14:09.979 --> 00:14:12.648
How's that sound?

138
00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:15.234
Is it legal?

139
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.404
What do you think?

140
00:14:21.365 --> 00:14:23.993

143
00:14:33.043 --> 00:14:35.212
No, it's not legal.

144
00:14:36.338 --> 00:14:40.509
But the good news
is, it's quick, easy, clean.


145
00:14:41.844 --> 00:14:44.304
What the fuck is this?

146
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:48.392
You ever see the movie Ocean's 11
with Frank Sinatra?


147
00:14:49.643 --> 00:14:51.437
Well, it's kind of like that.

148
00:14:51.895 --> 00:14:55.733
But, the point of all this is, does
it sound interesting?


149
00:15:00.738 --> 00:15:03.378
Getting together with a few friends
and a couple of days on Friday,


150

we're going to meet here.

in on what I need.

everybody gets a nice paycheck.


154
00:15:23.469 --> 00:15:26.305
But if you're happy working here-

155
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.727
-don't sweat it. 
She ya later, kid.

156
00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:19.440
That's quite the lighter.

157
00:16:19.441 --> 00:16:20.817
This was my brother's.

158
00:16:20.818 --> 00:16:22.861
You touch it and I'll break your arm.

159
00:16:35.415 --> 00:16:36.416
Let me see that.

160
00:16:36.542 --> 00:16:38.603
Hm? These are easy. It's all about
knowing the pattern.


161
00:16:38.627 --> 00:16:40.129
Same thing every time.

162
00:16:40.337 --> 00:16:43.340
All right. Just line
these guys up and then.


163
00:16:44.967 --> 00:16:46.969
Pretty straightforward. And then-

164
00:16:49.555 --> 00:16:52.808
Viola!
Looks great.


165
00:16:53.475 --> 00:16:55.477
Wait-
Can we just jump into this.


166
00:16:55.561 --> 00:16:57.789
I mean, I think everybody
that's going to be here is here.


167
00:16:57.813 --> 00:17:00.315
Oh, there she is. Come on in.

168
00:17:01.817 --> 00:17:03.861
It's good to see you. Grab a seat.

169
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.577
What is this? Well, let's just
say that I need all of you,


170
00:17:12.494 --> 00:17:15.664
and it's nice that everybody showed up.

171
00:17:15.747 --> 00:17:19.710
So I looked over your case histories,
and everybody's got criminal records.


172
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:22.421
Getaway drivers, muscle,

173
00:17:23.547 --> 00:17:26.091
burglar.
How'd you get those records?


174
00:17:26.633 --> 00:17:29.969
Ah, the less you know, the better.

175
00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:32.598
What I do know is that you guys
are all in good luck,


176
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.145
all needing a paycheck, all willing to ask
as few questions as possible.


177
00:17:38.395 --> 00:17:40.021
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's-

178
00:17:40.022 --> 00:17:42.357
So what exactly are we doing?

179
00:17:43.734 --> 00:17:46.320
So in a couple of weeks,
there's a jewelry store,


180
00:17:47.321 --> 00:17:50.365
their cameras are going to be down
while they upgrade their security systems.


181
00:17:51.158 --> 00:17:53.493
I need you all to go in
and clean the place out.


182
00:17:54.161 --> 00:17:56.955
I need all these hands to grab
as much as possible.


183
00:17:57.164 --> 00:17:59.833
Get out twice as quick.
What about alarms?


184
00:18:00.375 --> 00:18:03.212
Like I said, you'll be in and
out so quick it won't matter.


185
00:18:03.295 --> 00:18:04.880
What happens after that?

186
00:18:04.922 --> 00:18:07.256
You go to a motel outside of town.

187
00:18:07.257 --> 00:18:09.508
I made a deal with the motel manager.

188
00:18:09.509 --> 00:18:11.427
You guys will change clothes,

189
00:18:11.428 --> 00:18:13.763
and wait there until the heat is off.

190
00:18:13.764 --> 00:18:16.140
My associate will come pick up the jewels,

191
00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:17.501
and you can all go your merry way.

192
00:18:18.352 --> 00:18:21.230
Then when do we get paid?
On that day.


193
00:18:22.231 --> 00:18:24.566
You'll be paid cash. No taxes.

194
00:18:24.691 --> 00:18:28.111
The jewels seem worth
more than what you're paying.


195
00:18:29.988 --> 00:18:33.116
Well, somebody decides to take their
own jewels to get a bigger cut,


196
00:18:33.575 --> 00:18:35.744
their name finds their way to the police.

197
00:18:36.912 --> 00:18:38.664
Not just your name-

198
00:18:38.997 --> 00:18:40.414
everybody's name.

199
00:18:40.415 --> 00:18:42.542
That way, you're
all accountable to each other.


200
00:18:43.877 --> 00:18:47.214
So deal is my money, or jail.

201
00:18:47.422 --> 00:18:49.048
What if we need to reach you?

202
00:18:49.049 --> 00:18:51.885
Not going to happen. It's me to you.
The more you're in the dark,


203
00:18:51.927 --> 00:18:53.302
fewer liabilities.

204
00:18:53.303 --> 00:18:55.847
Which brings us to your names.

205
00:18:56.682 --> 00:18:58.641
Time to get acquainted.

206
00:18:58.642 --> 00:19:00.726
First, our drivers.

207
00:19:00.727 --> 00:19:05.857
Tessio. Frmhand. Likes to boost cars
once in a while.


208
00:19:07.025 --> 00:19:10.737
Carlo. Ex dirt track race driver.

209
00:19:11.154 --> 00:19:12.363
Ex?

210
00:19:12.364 --> 00:19:14.950
They don't let me compete anymore.

211
00:19:15.534 --> 00:19:16.535
Why's that?

212
00:19:16.576 --> 00:19:18.453
Too go

213
00:19:19.746 --> 00:19:20.872
No other reason?

214
00:19:21.498 --> 00:19:23.374
I have done some coke before races.

215
00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:25.251
Every race. Lotta coke.

216
00:19:25.252 --> 00:19:28.338
That make you go faster?
I felt like it.


217
00:19:29.172 --> 00:19:31.591
But if you're worried or square-

218
00:19:32.968 --> 00:19:34.969
- I chew gum instead now.
So are we done?


219
00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.389
Can we come back to a meeting here?

220
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:43.729
All right. Now, for those that aren't
behind the wheel, we have Sonny.


221
00:19:44.938 --> 00:19:47.482
Considered one of the baddest
motherfuckers in the Midwest.


222
00:19:49.067 --> 00:19:51.278
I looked over his records, and trust me,

223
00:19:52.154 --> 00:19:55.282
you want to stay on his good side.

224
00:19:55.824 --> 00:19:58.242
Fredo. Man of many connections, apparently.

225
00:19:58.243 --> 00:20:01.245
He's going to get us what we need.

226
00:20:01.246 --> 00:20:04.750
Weapons. No serial numbers.
Cake.


227
00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:09.504
Tom. Did some time in the military, knows
his way around a weapon or two.


228
00:20:10.297 --> 00:20:12.758
And Michael.
Young, inexperienced,


229
00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:15.677
a little sloppy, but eager. I like that.

230
00:20:17.304 --> 00:20:18.304
That brings us to you-

231
00:20:19.389 --> 00:20:22.059
Kay. Burglar extraordinaire.

232
00:20:22.142 --> 00:20:23.768
This woman has more tools in her purse

233
00:20:23.769 --> 00:20:26.271
to get her in and out of places
than you could imagine.


234
00:20:27.105 --> 00:20:29.982
So those are names. 
No real names.

235
00:20:29.983 --> 00:20:32.861
No point of contact, no liabilities.

236
00:20:33.111 --> 00:20:34.571
Who's Fredo?

237
00:20:36.073 --> 00:20:37.698
You're Fredo.

238
00:20:37.699 --> 00:20:40.535
No. in the movie.
He's a character.


239
00:20:40.744 --> 00:20:43.830
Yes, but who plays him?
This is based off a movie?


240
00:20:43.955 --> 00:20:46.500
Guys, come on. Focus.

241
00:20:46.875 --> 00:20:49.294
So, what's your name then?
Does it matter?


242
00:20:51.046 --> 00:20:53.589
Godmother?
Shouldn't it be God-Father?


243
00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:55.800
No. I'm your godmother.

244
00:20:55.801 --> 00:20:58.136
I'm going to make your wildest
dreams come true.


245
00:20:59.304 --> 00:21:01.972
Like I said, we only got a couple of weeks
to get ready for this thing


246
00:21:01.973 --> 00:21:06.186
and I'll be in touch with all of you
for details and updates.


247
00:21:06.311 --> 00:21:09.564
You're all going to be held accountable
for everything that you hear today


248
00:21:09.606 --> 00:21:12.943
so if anybody gets a weak
stomach about this thing,


249
00:21:14.027 --> 00:21:17.322
I'm expecting all of you to handle it.

250
00:21:17.864 --> 00:21:20.533
But it's not going
to come to that, right?

251
00:21:20.534 --> 00:21:23.661
Now. I'd like everybody
to stay out of trouble


252
00:21:23.662 --> 00:21:27.457
for the next couple of weeks.
But for for tonight-go home-


253
00:21:28.542 --> 00:21:31.044
- dream about what
you're going to do with your money.


254
00:21:48.145 --> 00:21:50.647
Hello. This is Tricia.
Please leave a message.


255
00:21:50.856 --> 00:21:51.856
Hey Mom.

256
00:21:53.024 --> 00:21:54.734
Sorry for calling so late, I.

257
00:21:56.069 --> 00:21:58.696
I just wanted to let you know
that it would mean a lot to me


258
00:21:58.697 --> 00:22:00.157
if you'd let me help.

259
00:22:01.116 --> 00:22:04.286
And like I said, I'm
sorry for what I got mixed in before and


260
00:22:05.954 --> 00:22:08.415
it won't happen again.

261
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.545
Okay. Well, call me when you get this.

262
00:22:14.546 --> 00:22:16.506
Hopefully hear from you soon.

263
00:22:18.925 --> 00:22:21.011
Really? You're the hotel manager.

264
00:22:21.303 --> 00:22:24.639
Look, they just ask for a room.
I don't know what they're doing.


265
00:22:24.681 --> 00:22:26.265
I don't know where they came from.

266
00:22:26.266 --> 00:22:27.017
I'm sorry, guys.

267
00:22:27.018 --> 00:22:28.268
I can't help you.

268
00:22:47.913 --> 00:22:50.874
Hello.
Yeah, it's. Hello, it's Gary.


269
00:22:51.666 --> 00:22:54.169
You see, you can't stay
at the motel tomorrow.


270
00:22:54.377 --> 00:22:56.337
What do you mean I can't use
the motel tomorrow?


271
00:22:56.338 --> 00:22:58.589
Well, there's some cops here as we speak.

272
00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.426
I think somebody was dealing
drugs out of one of the rooms.


273
00:23:02.052 --> 00:23:06.264
You know, honestly, I'm just upset
that I didn't know about it beforehand.


274
00:23:06.431 --> 00:23:08.390
I mean, they should have been
cutting me in. Okay.


275
00:23:08.391 --> 00:23:10.310
What the hell am
I supposed to do now?

276
00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:15.814
You got a pen?
Yeah.


277
00:23:15.815 --> 00:23:21.446
Yes. My parents owned a house outside
of town, and with them now passed on,


278
00:23:21.488 --> 00:23:22.947
God rest their souls,

279
00:23:22.948 --> 00:23:24.406
the place is empty.

280
00:23:24.407 --> 00:23:26.535
Have your crew stay there.

281
00:23:26.785 --> 00:23:28.870
What's the number?
I'm on the phone.


282
00:23:29.204 --> 00:23:30.746
What's the address?

283
00:23:30.747 --> 00:23:35.377
It's 2210 Elm Road,
just outside Devils Lake.


284
00:23:35.752 --> 00:23:36.919
I heard it was an emergency.

285
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.675
Will you wait?

286
00:23:41.841 --> 00:23:43.008
You know, they're going to be really upset

287
00:23:43.009 --> 00:23:45.678
if you don't get all the stuff down to-
Seven!


288
00:23:45.679 --> 00:23:49.099
2217 Elm Road

289
00:23:50.475 --> 00:23:52.017
Devils Lake, North Dakota.

290
00:23:52.018 --> 00:23:54.562
That's right. Yeah.
I'll just swing by after work


291
00:23:54.563 --> 00:23:57.065
and leave the doors unlocked
for when they get there.


292
00:23:57.357 --> 00:23:58.524
All right, great.

293
00:23:58.525 --> 00:24:01.820
I'm still getting my cut, right?

294
00:24:02.279 --> 00:24:05.282
Because I was looking forward
to replacing my countertops.


295
00:24:05.574 --> 00:24:09.828
You see, they remind me too much
of my mother. And I-No. 4%.


296
00:24:10.996 --> 00:24:13.622
Four?
Four.


297
00:24:13.623 --> 00:24:15.875
I'm not going any lower than six.

298
00:24:16.334 --> 00:24:19.086
Still four.
Oh, okay.


299
00:24:19.087 --> 00:24:20.297
Yeah, yeah. Four is good.

300
00:24:21.172 --> 00:24:23.924
Just have them take their shoes off
when they're in the place.


301
00:24:23.925 --> 00:24:27.178
I don't really want them to track dirt-
Fuck.


302
00:25:20.565 --> 00:25:23.734
Hello?
Michael! It's your godfather.


303
00:25:23.735 --> 00:25:28.365
God, whatever. I need you to relay
an address to the crew


304
00:25:28.448 --> 00:25:30.574
and I can't get a hold of anybody.

305
00:25:30.575 --> 00:25:32.618
Yeah, well, wait, wait, wait.
What's going on?


306
00:25:32.619 --> 00:25:34.119
There's too much heat at the motel.

307
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.080
There's something going on
with the police there.


308
00:25:36.081 --> 00:25:37.873
We have to change locations.

309
00:25:37.874 --> 00:25:40.626
I made arrangements for a house
out in the country.


310
00:25:40.627 --> 00:25:43.379
Should be empty, should be unlocked.

311
00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:45.924
You guys just lay low there
until the bag man shows up.


312
00:25:46.299 --> 00:25:48.759
All right?
Yeah, for sure.


313
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:54.766
Okay. Write down the address

314
00:25:55.308 --> 00:25:56.851
Devils Lake. North Dakota.

315
00:25:58.478 --> 00:26:03.566
Got it? Yeah. 2217 Elm Road,
Devil's Lake, North Dakota.


316
00:26:03.858 --> 00:26:06.861
Make sure everybody shows up
at the right address. Clear?


317
00:26:07.612 --> 00:26:10.407
Crystal.
Alright good.


318
00:26:36.391 --> 00:26:40.895
Yeah! Yeah! That's how you do it!
That's how you do it! Quick and clean!


319
00:26:42.147 --> 00:26:43.856
Let's get to this motel.

320
00:26:43.857 --> 00:26:47.068
Wait, wait. Don't go to the motel!

321
00:26:52.741 --> 00:26:53.949
What the hell is going on?

322
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.452
We're not going. The motel.
What?


323
00:26:56.453 --> 00:27:00.093
Godmother gave me a new address. Some house on
the country. I don't know, motel was too hot.


324
00:27:00.665 --> 00:27:02.166
Godmother gave this to you.

325
00:27:02.167 --> 00:27:04.960
Yeah. You're sure?
Yes!


326
00:27:04.961 --> 00:27:07.296
Are you playing us right now?

327
00:27:07.297 --> 00:27:09.923
Fine. Go to the motel. 
And then pass go

328
00:27:09.924 --> 00:27:11.717
and head straight to jail.

329
00:27:11.718 --> 00:27:13.887
Don't collect your money.

330
00:27:18.057 --> 00:27:21.019
All right. Got to keep moving. Let's go.

331
00:27:27.484 --> 00:27:29.277
You got a weird feeling about this?

332
00:27:29.486 --> 00:27:30.695
Nope.

333
00:28:09.192 --> 00:28:11.528
Hello?

334
00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.301
All right, grab the bags,

335
00:29:59.302 --> 00:30:01.429
Get em' in the basement.
Park the cars over there.


336
00:31:46.325 --> 00:31:50.997
Michael brought us to some house
in the middle of nowhere.


337
00:31:51.998 --> 00:31:55.752
He said something
about issues at the motel.


338
00:31:55.877 --> 00:31:58.004
Yeah, I gave Godmother the address.

339
00:31:58.046 --> 00:32:00.298
Just wait there until they
get in touch with you.


340
00:32:02.884 --> 00:32:04.968
You and Michael aren't
pulling anything, are you?


341
00:32:04.969 --> 00:32:07.220
I don't know who Michael is.

342
00:32:07.221 --> 00:32:10.558
I don't even really know
who Godfather is- or godmother.


343
00:32:11.225 --> 00:32:13.603
Just please don't track dirt in the-

344
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.321
All right, everyone, listen up.

345
00:32:24.155 --> 00:32:26.532
I just got off the phone
with the motel manager.


346
00:32:26.949 --> 00:32:29.951
Apparently, Michael
was telling the truth about there


347
00:32:29.952 --> 00:32:33.414
being too much heat at the motel.

348
00:32:34.290 --> 00:32:36.625
So we're going to lay low here

349
00:32:36.626 --> 00:32:39.461
till Godmother's associate
relieves us of the jewels.


350
00:32:39.462 --> 00:32:41.588
Just like before.

351
00:32:41.589 --> 00:32:43.883
But we need to go over a few things
in the meantime.


352
00:32:44.926 --> 00:32:47.553
First of all, the jewels

353
00:32:48.221 --> 00:32:52.767
stay in the basement
in the closet until we leave.


354
00:32:53.893 --> 00:32:57.146
Period. In fact, don't even go downstairs.

355
00:32:59.273 --> 00:33:01.651
If you see anyone go downstairs.

356
00:33:02.276 --> 00:33:04.779
We have a problem.
Second thing,


357
00:33:05.947 --> 00:33:08.532
no one goes out of this house

358
00:33:08.533 --> 00:33:10.660
under any circumstance.

359
00:33:12.453 --> 00:33:15.413
We are keeping a low profile.

360
00:33:15.414 --> 00:33:18.376
The only exception is
when we have a nightwatch.


361
00:33:18.918 --> 00:33:21.087
Is this also understood?

362
00:33:21.629 --> 00:33:24.590
Now, when night does come,

363
00:33:25.675 --> 00:33:27.759
if you need to get some sleep,

364
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.804
there's a bedroom upstairs,

365
00:33:29.887 --> 00:33:31.805
another one around the corner,

366
00:33:31.806 --> 00:33:32.931
I really don't care

367
00:33:32.932 --> 00:33:35.977
as long as it's not downstairs.

368
00:33:36.435 --> 00:33:39.271
Now I'm going to head up
and get some rest.


369
00:33:39.272 --> 00:33:42.275
I'll stay up overnight
to make sure no one goes near the jewels.


370
00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.821
The look out can hold me
accountable, vice versa.


371
00:33:48.739 --> 00:33:51.617
But we can worry about that more later.

372
00:33:53.369 --> 00:33:55.746
Is this clear to everyone?

373
00:33:57.206 --> 00:34:01.127
So who put you in charge?
What?


374
00:34:02.336 --> 00:34:03.963
You don't trust me?

375
00:34:04.547 --> 00:34:07.550
I don't even know you.
Well-


376
00:34:08.551 --> 00:34:10.595
looks like we got some time
to change all that, huh?


377
00:35:00.436 --> 00:35:04.356
So what are you
gonna spend your cut on?

378
00:35:04.357 --> 00:35:06.234
Um.

379
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:09.904
My family.
Oh, look at you.


380
00:35:10.571 --> 00:35:14.533
I'm probably going to get a car, like,
a really nice one.


381
00:35:15.493 --> 00:35:17.495
But I'll probably give some
to my family too,


382
00:35:18.204 --> 00:35:19.871
it's always the first thing on my mind.

383
00:35:19.872 --> 00:35:23.292
Family is very important.
Sure.


384
00:35:24.752 --> 00:35:27.712
Wow. You guys sure know how to party.

385
00:35:27.713 --> 00:35:31.425
I mean, we're rich, and it's
about as exciting as a funeral in here.


386
00:35:31.842 --> 00:35:34.762
Well, we're not rich yet.
Yeah, but the hard part is over.


387
00:35:35.012 --> 00:35:38.474
We need to celebrate a bit. Let loose.

388
00:35:41.102 --> 00:35:43.604
Anyone check the freezer at all?

389
00:35:58.202 --> 00:36:00.871
Hey, look at that.

390
00:36:03.207 --> 00:36:06.627
If it looks like whiskey and

391
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:11.131
smells like whiskey.

392
00:36:11.132 --> 00:36:13.592
You know, I think
it's about time we got outside.


393
00:36:14.552 --> 00:36:17.221
If anyone wants to join me, please do.

394
00:36:17.972 --> 00:36:20.265
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you also heard the whole,


395
00:36:20.266 --> 00:36:23.060
don't go outside, bit, Yeah?
That's right.


396
00:36:23.561 --> 00:36:25.020
He did say that, didn't he?

397
00:36:25.021 --> 00:36:28.065
But last time I checked,
he wasn't in charge.


398
00:36:28.232 --> 00:36:32.528
Well, what if someone did, you know,
drive by and-some cops or someone?


399
00:36:32.945 --> 00:36:35.488
What do you mean if they drive by?

400
00:36:35.489 --> 00:36:39.702
We're just some nice folk enjoying
the great outdoors and some whiskey.


401
00:36:40.369 --> 00:36:42.955
What could be more harmless than that?

402
00:36:43.873 --> 00:36:45.832
Look, I think it's about time
we all got out there.


403
00:36:45.833 --> 00:36:47.960
Enjoy some fresh air. 
Calm these nerves.

404
00:36:48.753 --> 00:36:50.838
I don't like doing it alone.
But don't think I won't.


405
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:55.343
And if Tom has a problem with
that, he can come tell me.


406
00:37:17.698 --> 00:37:20.910
That Tom guy's not going to like this.

407
00:37:43.933 --> 00:37:45.643
You ever kill someone?

408
00:37:49.146 --> 00:37:51.648
What?
Come on. You're a criminal.


409
00:37:51.649 --> 00:37:54.026
Don't be offended.
No, I haven't.


410
00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.863
Well would you?
Kill someone? Yeah.


411
00:37:58.572 --> 00:38:00.825
You think you got that killer instinct?

412
00:38:01.158 --> 00:38:03.868
Not a murderer.
I didn't say you were a murderer,


413
00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:06.205
I just want to know.
Would you ever pull the trigger?


414
00:38:07.123 --> 00:38:10.334
Let's say something goes wrong
or someone's in your way.


415
00:38:10.543 --> 00:38:11.544
It's you or them.

416
00:38:12.378 --> 00:38:13.378
Would you do it?

417
00:38:14.255 --> 00:38:16.424
I don't know.
Even if someone drew on you?


418
00:38:17.466 --> 00:38:19.426
I mean, probably.

419
00:38:19.427 --> 00:38:22.096
Probably? I doubt that.

420
00:38:23.597 --> 00:38:25.766
Have you ever killed someone?
No-


421
00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.394
But if I needed to, I would.

422
00:38:29.395 --> 00:38:31.480
That easy?
Sure.


423
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:34.149
That's pretty cold.

424
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:37.445
I don't think it's cold
as much as it is logical.


425
00:38:38.612 --> 00:38:40.698
You know, I don't
think it'd be that easy.

426
00:38:41.407 --> 00:38:43.284
Really? You don't think so?

427
00:38:44.326 --> 00:38:45.618
Let's say you're in this
situation where it's


428
00:38:45.619 --> 00:38:48.456
you or them. They kill you
unless you kill them.


429
00:38:49.582 --> 00:38:51.863
You don't think you wouldn't hesitate
to protect yourself?


430
00:38:55.296 --> 00:38:57.172
Dude.

431
00:38:57.173 --> 00:39:00.759
Relax. The safeties on.

432
00:39:02.803 --> 00:39:05.264
So would you shoot me in that situation?

433
00:39:07.683 --> 00:39:10.351
Sure.
It's fight or flight.


434
00:39:10.352 --> 00:39:11.603
It's in everyone.

435
00:39:11.604 --> 00:39:15.274
You know, you're not very good
at something tough.


436
00:39:18.068 --> 00:39:19.737
Where is everyone?

437
00:39:19.987 --> 00:39:23.866
It was like Godfather
Part one and two, Conversation, Dog Days.


438
00:39:24.909 --> 00:39:26.784
I think it was John something.

439
00:39:26.785 --> 00:39:28.120
I think you're right.

440
00:39:28.579 --> 00:39:30.622
Here comes Colin Powell.

441
00:39:30.623 --> 00:39:33.124
Great. He looks happy.

442
00:39:33.125 --> 00:39:36.337
You mind telling me what the fuck
you all doing out of the house?


443
00:39:36.587 --> 00:39:38.756
I thought we could
all use some fresh air.

444
00:39:41.675 --> 00:39:44.219
You know, I thought you look stupid,

445
00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:46.555
but at least now I know.

446
00:39:47.139 --> 00:39:49.975
Remember the whole point
I made about staying in the house?


447
00:39:50.935 --> 00:39:52.937
Once again. Remind me,

448
00:39:53.687 --> 00:39:55.898
who put you in charge?
No one.


449
00:39:57.358 --> 00:40:00.110
I just don't want to see some dumb ass
fuck up a whole deal.


450
00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.447
Now, if everyone could step in the house,

451
00:40:04.073 --> 00:40:06.575
that would be much appreciated.

452
00:40:18.796 --> 00:40:21.882
You know, someone of your age,

453
00:40:22.716 --> 00:40:25.386
I hear they're more susceptible
to heart attacks.


454
00:40:27.221 --> 00:40:29.598
You should calm down.

455
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.559
You calling me old?

456
00:40:31.725 --> 00:40:33.727
Just looking out for your health.

457
00:40:34.395 --> 00:40:36.355
I appreciate that.

458
00:40:37.064 --> 00:40:40.191
I think you should be looking out
for your own health.


459
00:40:40.192 --> 00:40:45.155
Is that supposed to be a threat?
No.


460
00:40:46.824 --> 00:40:49.118
That is no threat.

461
00:40:49.243 --> 00:40:51.245
That is a promise.

462
00:40:53.247 --> 00:40:58.085
Wow. That is super original.

463
00:40:59.878 --> 00:41:02.171
What movie did you hear that from?

464
00:41:02.172 --> 00:41:04.091
Get in the house.

465
00:41:04.758 --> 00:41:09.096
I will. On my own time.

466
00:41:11.473 --> 00:41:14.059
You think you're funny?
No.


467
00:41:15.686 --> 00:41:19.106
I think George Carlin is funny.

468
00:41:29.241 --> 00:41:35.205
I'm going to need you to calm down
and take your hand off the gun.


469
00:41:37.333 --> 00:41:39.084
Now stand up.

470
00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:46.800
Get in the house.

471
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.681
All right, everyone,
you heard the man.


472
00:42:34.014 --> 00:42:35.891
Alright.

473
00:42:36.725 --> 00:42:37.976
So here's the deal.

474
00:42:39.895 --> 00:42:41.897
I'm going to sit right here all night.

475
00:42:44.441 --> 00:42:47.152
Looks like we need to make sure
no one goes down stairs.


476
00:42:49.196 --> 00:42:52.866
Tessio's been so kind to volunteer
to stay up and be our first lookout.


477
00:42:53.742 --> 00:42:57.955
Oh, I did?
You needed some fresh air.


478
00:43:00.207 --> 00:43:02.750
Can I at least get my gun back?

479
00:43:02.751 --> 00:43:04.585
The one you tried to pull on me?

480
00:43:04.586 --> 00:43:07.172
Yeah, that one.
Don't worry.


481
00:43:07.923 --> 00:43:09.716
I'll look out for you.

482
00:43:09.717 --> 00:43:12.094
You're too considerate.

483
00:43:14.972 --> 00:43:16.723
Now someone else needs to relieve

484
00:43:16.724 --> 00:43:19.393
Tessio, say, around two.

485
00:43:20.769 --> 00:43:23.438
Who else is out there with our friend?

486
00:43:23.439 --> 00:43:25.899
Sonny? You needed some fresh air, right?

487
00:43:26.775 --> 00:43:28.777
You can get some more tonight.

488
00:43:28.902 --> 00:43:31.363
Everyone get some rest.

489
00:43:31.989 --> 00:43:35.159
Hopefully we are relieved tomorrow.

490
00:43:49.965 --> 00:43:50.965
Christ.

491
00:44:21.622 --> 00:44:24.416
Uh, you're up, man.

492
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:37.030
Hey. Hey sunshine!

493
00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:40.075
I'm gonna take your bag off

494
00:45:41.034 --> 00:45:43.286
and if you don't stop squirming, I'm

495
00:45:43.287 --> 00:45:48.834
going to cut your throat.

496
00:45:54.089 --> 00:45:56.341
What are you doing in our home?
Your home?


497
00:45:57.175 --> 00:46:02.764
- Are you the motel owner? - What?
- Help!


498
00:46:06.476 --> 00:46:08.729
If you don't want to die right here,

499
00:46:10.188 --> 00:46:11.397
best keep it down.

500
00:46:11.398 --> 00:46:13.107
Nobody can hear you out here anyway.

501
00:46:13.108 --> 00:46:15.027
Dumb motherfucker.

502
00:46:16.236 --> 00:46:18.363
What are you doing in our home?

503
00:46:18.405 --> 00:46:19.865
I'll try it again.

504
00:46:21.158 --> 00:46:23.452
Just laying low, man.
Laying low from whom?


505
00:46:24.661 --> 00:46:26.621
The police.
For what?


506
00:46:26.622 --> 00:46:28.582
A robbery.

507
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:33.128
What did you steal?
I don't think I should be telling you that.


508
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.046
I don't care one way or the other.

509
00:46:35.047 --> 00:46:37.341
So what you're telling me is

510
00:46:37.799 --> 00:46:40.302
that you all are hiding out here

511
00:46:41.762 --> 00:46:44.305
and nobody knows you're there.

512
00:46:44.306 --> 00:46:47.392
Yeah, I think that's the point.

513
00:46:48.936 --> 00:46:51.313
Say you look like you're from around here,

514
00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.230
where are you from?

515
00:46:52.231 --> 00:46:55.901
Brazil.
Brazil? You're that boy?!


516
00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.279
Brazilian barbecue.

517
00:48:35.834 --> 00:48:40.172
Tom... TOM!

518
00:48:41.173 --> 00:48:43.257
I'm not sleeping.

519
00:48:43.258 --> 00:48:47.137
How's the watch going?
Quiet enough.


520
00:48:57.981 --> 00:48:59.107
Hello?!

521
00:49:05.197 --> 00:49:07.616
Hey, who's on watch right now?

522
00:49:09.868 --> 00:49:11.495
Should be Sonny.

523
00:49:11.787 --> 00:49:13.747
Yeah. No, he's not there.

524
00:49:27.135 --> 00:49:28.637
Sonny!

525
00:49:33.058 --> 00:49:34.392
Get the others up.

526
00:50:06.591 --> 00:50:07.591
Sonny!

527
00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:37.037
We didn't have any luck either.

528
00:50:37.038 --> 00:50:39.499
Should we leave or-?
Where would he go?


529
00:50:40.667 --> 00:50:42.918
I mean, he didn't
take any of the jewels, right?


530
00:50:42.919 --> 00:50:44.795
No. It's all there.

531
00:50:44.796 --> 00:50:46.213
He wouldn't turn us in, would he?

532
00:50:46.214 --> 00:50:48.884
If he did, I assume the police
or someone would be here already.


533
00:50:49.676 --> 00:50:52.803
And I don't know why
he would do something like that do you?


534
00:50:52.804 --> 00:50:54.890
I think we should leave.
And go where?


535
00:50:55.182 --> 00:50:56.724
What's the plan then?

536
00:50:56.725 --> 00:51:00.770
I don't know. I just think
we should be prepared to leave if need be.


537
00:51:00.896 --> 00:51:03.398
No, the plan is to
stay here until relieved.


538
00:51:03.857 --> 00:51:06.526
Well, maybe one of us takes a drive,

539
00:51:06.735 --> 00:51:09.779
splits off from the rest of us
sees if they can find Sonny.


540
00:51:16.661 --> 00:51:20.749
I'll do it. Jewels can stay here-

541
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:22.042
I'll be right back.

542
00:51:41.394 --> 00:51:42.686
My car won't start.

543
00:51:42.687 --> 00:51:45.774
What do you mean, your car won't start?

544
00:52:04.125 --> 00:52:07.254
You look worried.
Well, I'm not.


545
00:52:08.171 --> 00:52:12.008
Look. Someone messed with it. See here?

546
00:52:14.344 --> 00:52:16.888
Okay. Come with me.

547
00:52:26.481 --> 00:52:29.358
Seems like someone tampered with this car.

548
00:52:29.359 --> 00:52:31.485
Now she won't run.

549
00:52:31.486 --> 00:52:33.863
What?
Maybe Sonny messed with the engine,


550
00:52:35.031 --> 00:52:37.658
but he didn't go downstairs.

551
00:52:37.659 --> 00:52:39.660
He didn't take any of the jewels.

552
00:52:39.661 --> 00:52:41.705
So far, he doesn't appear
he's ratted us out.


553
00:52:42.831 --> 00:52:45.083
So maybe it's not Sonny
we need to worry about.


554
00:52:45.709 --> 00:52:48.085
Did anybody see anything last night?

555
00:52:48.086 --> 00:52:50.630
I think we need to leave.
And once again, go where?


556
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:53.590
Risk getting arrested or a car spotted?

557
00:52:53.591 --> 00:52:56.261
If we need fresh vehicles,
will hijack some that pass by.


558
00:52:56.469 --> 00:52:58.596
No, this is already becoming a mess.

559
00:52:58.972 --> 00:53:01.057
We don't need to attract
more attention to us.


560
00:53:01.099 --> 00:53:03.267
It'll be easy.
No.


561
00:53:03.268 --> 00:53:06.563
Maybe we should call the hotel,
see if they've heard from Godmother?


562
00:53:10.859 --> 00:53:13.111
Yeah-fuck.

563
00:53:31.838 --> 00:53:36.009
So?
Nah, it appears someone cut the phone cord.


564
00:53:36.051 --> 00:53:39.637
You got to be fucking kidding me.
It's not working.


565
00:53:48.021 --> 00:53:50.148
Did you notice this at any point?

566
00:53:51.107 --> 00:53:52.107
No.

567
00:53:52.192 --> 00:53:54.444
Well that's great.

568
00:54:00.992 --> 00:54:02.951
I got a bad feeling about this.

569
00:54:02.952 --> 00:54:05.330
How long has it been cut?

570
00:54:06.122 --> 00:54:08.500
I don't know.
Well, did Sonny cut it?


571
00:54:08.875 --> 00:54:13.046
If not him- someone here did.

572
00:54:15.799 --> 00:54:17.216
Look, I'm going to try my car

573
00:54:17.217 --> 00:54:19.968
and take a look around and see
if I can find Sonny or something.


574
00:54:19.969 --> 00:54:22.222
Why would we let you leave
with the only working car?


575
00:54:22.263 --> 00:54:25.724
Look, man, if you want to take
the car, drive around by yourself


576
00:54:25.725 --> 00:54:27.811
looking for Sonny. 
Be my fucking guest.

577
00:54:29.062 --> 00:54:31.422
All right? I'll stay here with the jewels
and everyone else.


578
00:54:34.859 --> 00:54:36.361
Be quick.

579
00:54:37.862 --> 00:54:39.489
If you're pulling anything-

580
00:54:40.615 --> 00:54:42.659
or you're associated with anyone that is

581
00:54:44.035 --> 00:54:47.621
you and me are going
to have a problem.


582
00:54:47.622 --> 00:54:52.794
Look man, I want to get out of here as bad as you.
- I hope so.


583
00:55:15.358 --> 00:55:18.194
Everyone get back inside.

584
00:55:18.319 --> 00:55:21.364
We wait til Tessio gets back.

585
00:55:26.202 --> 00:55:28.245
You wouldn't happen
to know anything I don't,


586
00:55:28.246 --> 00:55:29.746
do you?

587
00:55:29.747 --> 00:55:33.126
I'm just as concerned as you are.

588
00:55:33.877 --> 00:55:35.170
I bet.

589
00:56:00.945 --> 00:56:05.825
What the hell?

590
00:56:42.070 --> 00:56:47.659
Hey. Whoever this is, whatever's going
on, you're not involved, right?


591
00:56:48.660 --> 00:56:50.954
No, I'm not involved.

592
00:56:51.913 --> 00:56:55.625
I mean, even if I was,
why would I tell you?


593
00:56:56.709 --> 00:56:57.834
If this goes south,

594
00:56:57.835 --> 00:57:01.005
whatever this is,
we need to stick together.


595
00:57:02.507 --> 00:57:05.593
And why should I trust you?
Good point.


596
00:57:06.678 --> 00:57:09.439
But when you're out of options,
you're going to have to trust someone.


597
00:57:10.765 --> 00:57:13.560
You got something
you want to share with us?


598
00:57:13.935 --> 00:57:17.438
I'm good.
- Why don't we go out to the entryway to keep each other company.


599
00:57:19.357 --> 00:57:21.651
Til Tessio gets back.

600
00:57:21.776 --> 00:57:24.404
Sure, yeah. It's funny for.

601
00:57:27.073 --> 00:57:28.241
Sonny!

602
00:57:59.522 --> 00:58:03.151
Well, this is fun.

603
00:58:15.204 --> 00:58:17.248
Why don't you take a picture?

604
00:58:17.915 --> 00:58:22.544
That's okay. Say you're
the one who brought us here, right?


605
00:58:22.545 --> 00:58:26.256
Yeah. That's what I was told to do.

606
00:58:26.257 --> 00:58:28.301
Anyone think that's funny,

607
00:58:28.384 --> 00:58:30.887
that you're the only one
godmother talked to?


608
00:58:31.095 --> 00:58:34.182
He's on the level.
I talked to the motel manager.


609
00:58:34.641 --> 00:58:35.932
Well, guess what?

610
00:58:35.933 --> 00:58:38.895
No one else here can vouch for
the both of you are saying.


611
00:58:40.104 --> 00:58:43.608
I mean, whatever is happening right now,

612
00:58:45.026 --> 00:58:47.819
somebody is up to something.

613
00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:49.989
I don't think authorities are involved.

614
00:58:51.449 --> 00:58:53.867
Maybe Godmother's ripping us off-

615
00:58:53.868 --> 00:58:56.036
or maybe it's one of us.

616
00:58:56.037 --> 00:59:00.375
Right now, we need to stick together.

617
00:59:01.042 --> 00:59:04.337
We need trust.
I'm not about to trust anyone here.


618
00:59:04.629 --> 00:59:05.796
What are you trying to say?

619
00:59:05.797 --> 00:59:08.174
I'm just saying I don't want
to get ripped off.


620
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:13.638
And I assume that feeling is mutual. Trust
is what's going to get us through this.


621
00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.223
Trust is for fools.
Fine.


622
00:59:16.224 --> 00:59:19.643
Don't trust me. But stop staring at me
like you've got a problem.


623
00:59:19.644 --> 00:59:24.357
What? Paranoid?
- No. I just have a basic understanding of manners.


624
00:59:24.399 --> 00:59:25.274
You're saying I don't?

625
00:59:25.275 --> 00:59:28.402
What I'm saying is, if there's anyone here
that I don't like, it's you.


626
00:59:28.403 --> 00:59:29.903
Then you should do something.

627
00:59:29.904 --> 00:59:33.825
Can you guys just lay off
each other for 2 minutes?


628
00:59:34.742 --> 00:59:37.453
We're all on the same team.
Hopefully.


629
00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.248
Why don't you take his gun, too?

630
00:59:41.249 --> 00:59:45.669
- Just to be safe. Over my dead body.
- Okay.


631
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:49.924
Stop! Both of you, calm down.

632
00:59:51.050 --> 00:59:56.222
I'm just saying I'd feel a lot
more comfortable if I had my gun back.


633
00:59:56.556 --> 00:59:59.642
Yeah, well, I wouldn't. Now, shut up.

634
01:00:06.065 --> 01:00:07.525
What the fuck?

635
01:00:08.151 --> 01:00:10.987
Ah! Shit! Shit!

636
01:00:13.364 --> 01:00:15.825
Fuck. Fuck!

637
01:00:22.749 --> 01:00:24.208
Help!

638
01:00:33.968 --> 01:00:38.014
Alfredo! Carlo!

639
01:00:53.571 --> 01:00:57.575
- Oh. Shit. - What?
- I think my gun is missing.


640
01:00:57.825 --> 01:00:59.618
Your gun is missing?

641
01:00:59.619 --> 01:01:01.788
Yeah. Somebody must have lifted it.

642
01:01:02.288 --> 01:01:04.414
You lost your gun?

643
01:01:04.415 --> 01:01:06.334
Maybe Sonny took it.

644
01:01:06.501 --> 01:01:08.794
I need to find my gun.

645
01:01:08.795 --> 01:01:12.088
I'm keeping my eyes on everyone right now.

646
01:01:12.089 --> 01:01:14.717
Don't worry. I've got mine.

647
01:01:17.178 --> 01:01:19.806
You feel kind of naked now, huh?

648
01:02:38.217 --> 01:02:39.968
They should have been back by now.

649
01:02:39.969 --> 01:02:43.598
- Where are they? - You need to keep your cool.
- I'm out of gum.


650
01:02:44.724 --> 01:02:46.308
I want my cut. 
I'm out of here.

651
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:48.143
Me too.
Shut up.


652
01:02:48.144 --> 01:02:50.270
And no you're not, out of the question.

653
01:02:50.271 --> 01:02:53.983
It's my choice.
It's not your choice, we are a group,


654
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:57.820
and I'm not about to let you
jeopardize this group.


655
01:02:58.613 --> 01:03:00.363
Are you kidding me?

656
01:03:00.364 --> 01:03:02.283
We need to wait till Tessio gets back.

657
01:03:05.328 --> 01:03:07.788
This is getting ridiculous.

658
01:03:09.582 --> 01:03:12.043
I need to get out of this house.

659
01:03:14.170 --> 01:03:19.091
Hey. Sit down. God damn it!

660
01:03:20.134 --> 01:03:21.969
Everyone stay put.

661
01:03:24.639 --> 01:03:26.682
You were the big guy. Stay put.

662
01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:29.142
Where are you going?

663
01:03:29.143 --> 01:03:31.270
Getting my share.

664
01:03:33.481 --> 01:03:36.524
Back in the house.
And do what?


665
01:03:36.525 --> 01:03:39.110
We need to calm down
and stick to a plan.


666
01:03:39.111 --> 01:03:42.155
And what plan is that going to be?

667
01:03:42.156 --> 01:03:45.492
I don't know yet
but we need to keep our heads.


668
01:03:45.493 --> 01:03:47.494
What if Fredo was right?

669
01:03:47.495 --> 01:03:49.955
What if Michael is in on it?

670
01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:51.457
What if he's not?

671
01:03:55.503 --> 01:03:58.756
Maybe you are.
You need to calm down real quick.


672
01:04:04.595 --> 01:04:11.352
You've gotta be kidding me.
Hey, stop!


673
01:04:11.852 --> 01:04:14.105
What do you think you're doing?

674
01:04:15.356 --> 01:04:18.651
I trust myself more
than I trust any of you.


675
01:04:19.026 --> 01:04:21.529
I'm just taking my cut
and going my own way.


676
01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:23.364
I suggest you all do the same.

677
01:04:24.907 --> 01:04:26.324
You keeping us in the house,

678
01:04:26.325 --> 01:04:28.786
is beginning to look more
and more like a death sentence.


679
01:04:29.286 --> 01:04:33.040
I'm not going back.
Last warning.


680
01:04:38.546 --> 01:04:41.674
You know what? 
Maybe you're right.

681
01:04:42.675 --> 01:04:44.968
Maybe I should go back in the house.

682
01:04:44.969 --> 01:04:48.556
Take your cut as well, since you're hell
bent on throwing yours into the wind.


683
01:04:48.931 --> 01:04:50.890
Big threat from a man with no gun.

684
01:04:50.891 --> 01:04:53.435
Take it easy!
That's right.


685
01:04:53.436 --> 01:04:55.520
You're going to shoot an unarmed man?

686
01:04:55.521 --> 01:04:57.565
If you're smart,
you'll go back in the house.


687
01:04:57.898 --> 01:05:00.109
Let us take our cuts and leave.

688
01:05:00.443 --> 01:05:02.611
We are not discussing this.

689
01:05:02.987 --> 01:05:05.865
Everyone better pick a side right now.

690
01:05:05.948 --> 01:05:08.951
We are not picking sides!

691
01:05:09.535 --> 01:05:11.996
3 seconds to get back in the house.

692
01:05:38.606 --> 01:05:40.775
Kay, throw your gun to the side.

693
01:05:47.865 --> 01:05:51.702
Michael, you really shouldn't
leave your weapon laying around.


694
01:05:53.954 --> 01:05:56.457
All right. You two
have seemed pretty chummy.


695
01:05:57.208 --> 01:06:00.252
Let's get you inside
and see what you know.


696
01:06:08.886 --> 01:06:10.930
For the last time,

697
01:06:11.388 --> 01:06:13.181
you mind telling me what's going on?

698
01:06:13.182 --> 01:06:15.392
Or, maybe your girlfriend does.

699
01:06:16.018 --> 01:06:19.730
I've seen you two talk and the whole
fucking time. Meh-meh-meh-meh-meh.


700
01:06:21.649 --> 01:06:23.358
You know each other before this?

701
01:06:23.359 --> 01:06:24.859
I don't know anything.

702
01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:27.195
I have never met this man before.

703
01:06:27.196 --> 01:06:29.657
Get me out of this chair.

704
01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:33.285
I say we just get out of here.

705
01:06:37.164 --> 01:06:40.543
All right, let's get the bags.
Yeah.


706
01:06:46.924 --> 01:06:50.344
Darling, can I get a kiss for
the road? I'll take it.


707
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:26.380
All right. Next car that comes
by, we'll take.


708
01:07:26.881 --> 01:07:27.882
After that-

709
01:07:29.258 --> 01:07:31.384
you can find me in the Bahamas.

710
01:07:31.385 --> 01:07:33.053
Sounds good to me.

711
01:07:38.642 --> 01:07:42.688
Man, that is a lot of jewelry.

712
01:07:45.232 --> 01:07:46.442
And split two ways-

713
01:07:47.902 --> 01:07:50.446
that ain't bad.
No, it's not.


714
01:08:07.504 --> 01:08:11.759
God damn it.

715
01:08:17.514 --> 01:08:19.266
You okay there, Tessio?

716
01:08:21.727 --> 01:08:23.811
I think my name was Carlo.

717
01:08:23.812 --> 01:08:28.359
Oh, right.

718
01:08:46.502 --> 01:08:51.840
Ow, ow, ow. Oh! Ow! Oh!

719
01:09:02.977 --> 01:09:05.646
Did you hear that?
Yep.


720
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:43.142
Hey. Over here.
I'm hurt.


721
01:09:55.154 --> 01:09:58.032
It's fine. I'll come to you.

722
01:10:55.589 --> 01:10:57.508
Wait!

723
01:10:58.926 --> 01:11:03.138
Fredo was played by John Cazale.

724
01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:13.774
I think we should go.

725
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:15.651
Good plan.

726
01:11:45.097 --> 01:11:47.391
The coast is clear!

727
01:11:49.017 --> 01:11:51.186
Howdy, bitch.
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!


728
01:12:02.156 --> 01:12:05.576
Ahaha! Woo!

729
01:14:52.326 --> 01:14:55.078
Why don't youcome downstairs?

730
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:58.165
You're just making it harder on yourself.

731
01:19:46.995 --> 01:19:49.080
Don't move!

732
01:19:50.498 --> 01:19:52.416
Are you a godfather?

733
01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:55.461
Godmother?
Whatever.


734
01:19:55.462 --> 01:19:59.299
Yeah. I'm Kay. Are you the bag man?
Yeah.


735
01:20:06.389 --> 01:20:08.016
Can we please leave?

736
01:20:09.976 --> 01:20:14.563
The official body count around
the property in Devils Lake has risen


737
01:20:14.564 --> 01:20:21.196
to eight, authorities describing it
as a massacre with no clear explanation.


738
01:20:21.529 --> 01:20:25.240
The victims are all males suffering
from a mix of bullet


739
01:20:25.241 --> 01:20:28.745
and stab wounds,
as well as blunt force trauma.


740
01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:32.539
If one thing is for certain
what ever occurred


741
01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:35.210
on that property,
it could not have been good.


742
01:20:35.919 --> 01:20:38.296
Up next, sports. Stay tuned.
