1
00:00:16.322 --> 00:00:18.046
- Zaytoven.

2
00:00:39.894 --> 00:00:42.265
- This is definitely big, we made this.

3
00:00:42.265 --> 00:00:43.953
If anybody knows they told me

4
00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:46.536
it ain't got nothing for music.

5
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:52.219
But out of all
the time I perform music,

6
00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.263
I for sure never got no awards.

7
00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:57.467
So this is my first
time getting the award.


8
00:00:57.467 --> 00:01:00.394
So I appreciate y'all
and throw it to the DJ


9
00:01:00.394 --> 00:01:02.605
which makes it even more special then

10
00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:05.219
that I'm getting the legend
award, you know what I mean?


11
00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.303
I feel like I'm still young.

12
00:01:07.303 --> 00:01:10.156
I feel like I'm
still excited to do music.

13
00:01:10.156 --> 00:01:12.368
I'm still competitive, 
I still wanna beat

14
00:01:12.368 --> 00:01:15.118
every other producer in the game.

15
00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:28.316
- What do churchgoers think of
your other life making beats?


16
00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:31.655
- You know what, I almost was
ashamed of it for a while,


17
00:01:31.655 --> 00:01:34.741
like I don't want them
to know that I do this.


18
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:36.508
Certain people do know.

19
00:01:36.508 --> 00:01:39.237
So you know, a lot of the
churches I done played


20
00:01:39.237 --> 00:01:40.570
for the pastors.

21
00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:56.049
- For me, it
just kind of came from

22
00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.785
when I was listening to
everything he was doing.


23
00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:00.517
- Standard setting.

24
00:03:00.517 --> 00:03:02.045
- Ooh, trendsetting.

25
00:03:02.878 --> 00:03:04.378
- Pioneer setting.

26
00:03:05.332 --> 00:03:06.816
Trendsetting.

27
00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:08.579
- Sitting on the couch kind
of like describes it all.


28
00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.706
I just kind of, from
here's where I came from.


29
00:03:12.706 --> 00:03:13.539
I came for him.

30
00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:15.706
- So trap music in the UK.

31
00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:19.293
Whaddya, whaddya, bam!

32
00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:21.660
- Give us some food, give
us some real substance.


33
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.885
But right now as an artist
that's trying to jump in


34
00:03:23.885 --> 00:03:25.905
and get in the game and
keep up with going on,


35
00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:27.230
boy go in there and get,

36
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.391
turn that beat on and go
in that microphone booth


37
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:31.233
and start saying the first
thing come to your head.


38
00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:33.733
Catch a vibe, catch a feeling.

39
00:03:49.776 --> 00:03:53.276
So being genuine is really being authentic

40
00:03:54.362 --> 00:03:56.685
and true to yourself.

41
00:03:56.685 --> 00:03:59.362
It's not really jumping on every new thing

42
00:03:59.362 --> 00:04:02.894
that come out, every
new wave that's poppin'.


43
00:04:02.894 --> 00:04:06.021
It's continuing to stick to your sound

44
00:04:06.021 --> 00:04:07.705
and stick to what you do

45
00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:10.202
and let other people come in to that.

46
00:04:10.202 --> 00:04:13.773
Now for me, staying true to myself

47
00:04:13.773 --> 00:04:17.356
was really the most
important thing for me.


48
00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:20.058
What's up?

49
00:04:20.058 --> 00:04:21.188
- Got a question.
- Mhmm.


50
00:04:21.188 --> 00:04:22.636
- How the hell
you in the music industry

51
00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:24.199
and you never smoked a blunt before?

52
00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:29.295
- Well, all my friends,
all my friends drink.


53
00:04:29.295 --> 00:04:31.241
You know, all my friends they smoke weed

54
00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:32.487
and everything like that.

55
00:04:32.487 --> 00:04:34.135
And that's cool, that's them.

56
00:04:34.135 --> 00:04:35.382
That just never been me.

57
00:04:35.382 --> 00:04:37.187
The way I was raised,
the way I grew up.

58
00:04:37.187 --> 00:04:39.916
That just, you know, never
something that enticed me.


59
00:04:39.916 --> 00:04:41.802
You know, and at the same time,

60
00:04:41.802 --> 00:04:44.726
they'll call, they laugh
at me and call me lame.


61
00:04:44.726 --> 00:04:46.769
I look at them
and call them a crackhead.

62
00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:50.025
Yeah but really,

63
00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:54.765
staying focused on yourself
and mastering yourself


64
00:04:54.765 --> 00:04:57.651
is the hardest thing to
do when it comes to this.


65
00:04:57.651 --> 00:04:59.052
Whether you trying to be a DJ

66
00:04:59.052 --> 00:05:01.149
or rapper or producer or whatever.

67
00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:06.149
So I remember like my friends
playing Xbox and Playstation.


68
00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:07.719
While they was doing that,

69
00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:10.406
my parents had me in a
church playing music.


70
00:05:10.406 --> 00:05:12.127
Now while I was
playing music in a church,

71
00:05:12.127 --> 00:05:16.415
I never knew that that
would be my way of living


72
00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:17.818
on down the road.

73
00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.183
You know I didn't
know I was locking in

74
00:05:19.183 --> 00:05:20.987
and zoning in what
I was gonna be doing

75
00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.082
for the rest of my life
back when I was playing


76
00:05:23.082 --> 00:05:25.186
music in a church.

77
00:05:25.186 --> 00:05:27.972
- OK, thank you Mr. Zaytoven.

78
00:05:27.972 --> 00:05:31.304
OK you guys, we're gonna
take one more question.


79
00:05:31.304 --> 00:05:36.017
But I really need you to be
respectful of the time, OK?


80
00:05:36.017 --> 00:05:37.600
- Oh hey, yo, here!

81
00:05:38.948 --> 00:05:40.268
Come on you act
like you don't see that,

82
00:05:40.268 --> 00:05:42.636
every time I got something to
say you don't wanna hear it!


83
00:05:42.636 --> 00:05:44.672
- Mr. Wayfield.

84
00:05:44.672 --> 00:05:46.082
Mr. Wayfield.

85
00:05:46.082 --> 00:05:47.727
Do you realize I haven't
seen you in this class


86
00:05:47.727 --> 00:05:49.692
in three weeks, sir?

87
00:05:49.692 --> 00:05:51.109
- Ooh.

88
00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.149
- I been busy, bro.

89
00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:56.671
Trying to get to it man, you crazy.

90
00:05:56.671 --> 00:05:57.504
For real.

91
00:05:57.504 --> 00:05:58.925
- You know what, 
I know what you can do.

92
00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:00.092
You can get up, you get out,

93
00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:01.375
and go to financial aid.

94
00:06:01.375 --> 00:06:02.875
- Oooh.

95
00:06:04.227 --> 00:06:06.441
- Financial aid, for what?

96
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:07.772
For what?

97
00:06:07.772 --> 00:06:09.547
- Heard your account was delinquent.

98
00:06:09.547 --> 00:06:12.170
- Dang, oooh!

99
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.453
- What, get out, get out,

100
00:06:13.453 --> 00:06:15.420
calm down, two G finally got ooh ahh.

101
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.253
All right, man,

102
00:06:16.253 --> 00:06:18.488
you gonna see me Miss
Carter, I promise you bro.


103
00:06:18.488 --> 00:06:20.572
I'ma turn up on
you the worse way bro.

104
00:06:20.572 --> 00:06:22.413
Big bad coming my way.

105
00:06:22.413 --> 00:06:24.134
Hey Zay, don't forget my face bro.

106
00:06:24.134 --> 00:06:26.097
Just remember me, my boy, just remember.

107
00:06:26.097 --> 00:06:28.825
I'ma turn up on you, look around, buddy.

108
00:06:28.825 --> 00:06:30.671
- All right guys, we're gonna continue on.

109
00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:33.184
Mr. Addy, you have a question, right?

110
00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:34.351
Just go ahead.

111
00:06:34.351 --> 00:06:35.184
- Appreciate it.

112
00:06:35.184 --> 00:06:38.043
So how hard was it to
get your first placement?


113
00:06:38.043 --> 00:06:38.885
You know what, better yet,

114
00:06:38.885 --> 00:06:42.136
how is it working with Gucci and Future?

115
00:06:42.136 --> 00:06:43.981
- Oh you know what, my first placement,

116
00:06:43.981 --> 00:06:46.591
I ain't even know what a placement was.

117
00:06:46.591 --> 00:06:49.154
It was something like my
cousin had put together


118
00:06:49.154 --> 00:06:51.962
and almost really fell in my lap.

119
00:06:51.962 --> 00:06:55.168
But now working with Gucci and Future,

120
00:06:55.168 --> 00:06:57.735
come on man, that's the best
thing in the world to do.


121
00:06:57.735 --> 00:07:00.861
- How it feel to have your
first song on the radio?


122
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:01.988
- What's so crazy man,

123
00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:04.316
I'm out playing basketball, right?

124
00:07:04.316 --> 00:07:06.843
My buddies had to come
drag me to the car

125
00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.848
to listen to the song.

126
00:07:08.848 --> 00:07:10.971
Like Zay, your song playing on the radio.

127
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:13.257
So it blew my mind at the time.

128
00:07:13.257 --> 00:07:16.178
And you know, back then it's like,

129
00:07:16.178 --> 00:07:20.705
that's when it was, life was
a whole lot easier back then.


130
00:07:20.705 --> 00:07:24.553
I actually, I really enjoyed
doing music back then.


131
00:07:24.553 --> 00:07:25.797
Yeah.

132
00:07:34.994 --> 00:07:35.827
Yo.

133
00:07:35.827 --> 00:07:37.072
- Hey.

134
00:07:37.072 --> 00:07:39.255
Yeah so Brie has a fever again.

135
00:07:39.255 --> 00:07:42.033
Miss Richardson's class
has a bug going around.


136
00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:43.719
- I can go by the
pharmacy if you need me to.


137
00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:46.126
- Yeah right, so you can say
that I forgot to tell you


138
00:07:46.126 --> 00:07:48.168
and you didn't pick up the prescription

139
00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:52.499
so no, don't worry about
it, I will handle it myself.


140
00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:53.460
- Don't do that.

141
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.385
- How'd it go at the school?

142
00:07:55.385 --> 00:07:56.559
- Oh, nah it was cool.

143
00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:58.564
Yeah it was cool.

144
00:07:58.564 --> 00:08:00.048
- Yeah?

145
00:08:00.048 --> 00:08:02.548
OK, well did you eat anything?

146
00:08:03.387 --> 00:08:06.799
- No, I don't need nothing to eat.

147
00:08:06.799 --> 00:08:09.009
- Bae, you gotta make
sure you treat your body.


148
00:08:09.009 --> 00:08:11.020
- Yeah, yeah, OK, all right.
- All right?


149
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.386
OK, love you.

150
00:08:12.386 --> 00:08:15.136
- All right, love you too.
- Bye.


151
00:08:18.561 --> 00:08:19.526
- Yo, Zaytoven.

152
00:08:19.526 --> 00:08:20.768
What you said in that room assessment,

153
00:08:20.768 --> 00:08:22.174
you a real inspiration.

154
00:08:22.174 --> 00:08:24.059
Can you take a picture
with before you leave?


155
00:08:24.059 --> 00:08:24.892
- Here, come on.

156
00:08:24.892 --> 00:08:26.392
- Appreciate that.

157
00:08:27.347 --> 00:08:28.189
Thank you my man.

158
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:29.022
- OK, man.

159
00:08:29.022 --> 00:08:30.355
- For real.
- OK.


160
00:08:33.738 --> 00:08:35.412
- Hey, hold up, hold up.

161
00:08:35.412 --> 00:08:36.661
- How are you?
- Hey, I know you


162
00:08:36.661 --> 00:08:39.137
don't know me, I'm just from--
- Claire's.


163
00:08:39.137 --> 00:08:41.794
- Yeah, she be wigging, bro,
and all that, on home ground.


164
00:08:41.794 --> 00:08:45.318
- Brian, I thought I asked
you to leave the building.


165
00:08:45.318 --> 00:08:47.107
Security asked you to leave the building.

166
00:08:47.107 --> 00:08:48.390
- Come on, come on--
- Why are you still here?


167
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.240
Please don't do that to
him, let this man get out


168
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.125
of the building.
- Let me just--


169
00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:53.282
- Sorry about this, sir.

170
00:08:53.282 --> 00:08:54.826
You need to get out of the building.

171
00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.382
I need you to go.
- Don't do it like that, bro.


172
00:08:56.382 --> 00:08:57.497
- You need to leave the building.

173
00:09:00.208 --> 00:09:02.208
Bye, leave the building.

174
00:09:04.592 --> 00:09:05.866
♪ Go get the money machine ♪

175
00:09:05.866 --> 00:09:06.929
♪ Go get the money machine ♪

176
00:09:06.929 --> 00:09:08.868
♪ Go get the money machine ♪

177
00:09:08.868 --> 00:09:11.142
- Yo, man, quit fucking
texting and make a right, yo.


178
00:09:11.142 --> 00:09:13.337
- You what, who the fuck
you think you talking to?


179
00:09:13.337 --> 00:09:14.624
I ain't one of these bitches.

180
00:09:14.624 --> 00:09:17.041
You got me fucked up.
- Drive.


181
00:09:25.395 --> 00:09:28.868
- Hello.
- Yo, tell me something.


182
00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:32.756
Why do a multimillion
producer such as yourself


183
00:09:32.756 --> 00:09:35.327
can never answer the phone for the man

184
00:09:35.327 --> 00:09:37.244
that help him get rich?

185
00:09:38.958 --> 00:09:41.996
- I'm out today, 
I don't see you nowhere.

186
00:09:41.996 --> 00:09:45.231
You supposed to be right there with me.

187
00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:47.293
Man, you be playing.

188
00:09:47.293 --> 00:09:48.532
You about to get fired.

189
00:09:48.532 --> 00:09:49.639
- Fired, fired for what?

190
00:09:49.639 --> 00:09:50.925
I'm not even your manager, Zay.

191
00:09:50.925 --> 00:09:52.906
- Hey, did you hear me, can
we stop at the liquor store?


192
00:09:52.906 --> 00:09:54.881
- Would you shut up?

193
00:09:54.881 --> 00:09:56.559
- You still on payroll, ain't you?

194
00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:57.937
- Yeah, that's right,
I know what that means.


195
00:09:57.937 --> 00:10:00.108
I love him, but not enough
to give him a real job,


196
00:10:00.108 --> 00:10:02.273
so I just made him make me.

197
00:10:02.273 --> 00:10:06.729
- No, what that means is
you getting your free check.


198
00:10:06.729 --> 00:10:08.769
- Getting a free check,
nigga, I deserve it.


199
00:10:08.769 --> 00:10:10.500
Just think about it.

200
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.870
Six years ago, you was in
a red fucked up Beetle.


201
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.297
- OK, so what?

202
00:10:15.297 --> 00:10:18.788
- Nigga, now you money
dripping, big whipping,


203
00:10:18.788 --> 00:10:22.439
we don't know which mother
fucking car we pimping nigga.


204
00:10:22.439 --> 00:10:25.046
Tell me God ain't good.

205
00:10:25.046 --> 00:10:28.303
- No, man, you making you
a sweet amount of money


206
00:10:28.303 --> 00:10:29.303
every month.

207
00:10:30.326 --> 00:10:32.505
And you still doing
the same old thing like


208
00:10:32.505 --> 00:10:34.616
you still in the street.

209
00:10:34.616 --> 00:10:36.871
You too grown for that.

210
00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:38.823
- Say, listen, 
I got to be in the street.

211
00:10:38.823 --> 00:10:40.406
I need some money, I
need it fast, instant.


212
00:10:40.406 --> 00:10:43.697
But furthermore, more importantly,
where's Johnny at, man?


213
00:10:43.697 --> 00:10:45.219
I made it to
the meeting right now, bro.

214
00:10:45.219 --> 00:10:46.357
You're the one late.

215
00:10:46.357 --> 00:10:47.705
Your man late, you late.

216
00:10:47.705 --> 00:10:50.705
I'm the one set this meeting
up so you can not be late, bro.


217
00:10:50.705 --> 00:10:52.629
You and Johnny always late, come on,

218
00:10:52.629 --> 00:10:54.263
y'all tripping, bro.

219
00:10:54.263 --> 00:10:55.978
- Hey Zaytoven.

220
00:10:55.978 --> 00:10:58.157
- What the fuck, why is
y'all talking to him, anyway?


221
00:10:58.157 --> 00:10:59.339
Like you're not with me.

222
00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:02.952
Y'all with me, first of all.

223
00:11:02.952 --> 00:11:05.357
- You're acting like a kid almost.

224
00:11:05.357 --> 00:11:06.389
- What do you mean?

225
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:10.322
- Why would you bring some hood
rats to a corporate meeting?


226
00:11:10.322 --> 00:11:13.127
Like, I mean, come on, you
smell like a pile of weed.


227
00:11:13.127 --> 00:11:14.281
- No I don't.

228
00:11:14.281 --> 00:11:17.495
- Your shirt wrinkled like you
been wrestling or something.


229
00:11:17.495 --> 00:11:19.608
- Hey, I had a long night
getting steamrolled.


230
00:11:19.608 --> 00:11:21.409
What's wrong with you?

231
00:11:21.409 --> 00:11:22.508
You need to get more of that.

232
00:11:22.508 --> 00:11:24.297
- Man, you still
on this dope fiend deal.

233
00:11:24.297 --> 00:11:26.530
Come on, try to step it up.

234
00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:27.908
- Listen, man, we're getting money.

235
00:11:27.908 --> 00:11:29.459
What you talking about?
- You're gonna get fired.


236
00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:30.617
- More deals.

237
00:11:30.617 --> 00:11:32.139
I ain't even your manager anyway.

238
00:11:32.139 --> 00:11:35.222
If we're trying to talk all the time.

239
00:11:38.325 --> 00:11:40.325
- What's up?
- What's up?


240
00:11:41.344 --> 00:11:42.177
- Yo.

241
00:11:42.177 --> 00:11:44.642
Took me two months to
get this meet set up.


242
00:11:44.642 --> 00:11:45.883
Is he ready?
- Man, you know


243
00:11:45.883 --> 00:11:47.322
he's ready, dude, we got this.

244
00:11:47.322 --> 00:11:48.654
I set this meeting up anyway.

245
00:11:48.654 --> 00:11:50.174
- Look, man, I hope he ready, man.

246
00:11:50.174 --> 00:11:51.841
Man, you stink, man.

247
00:11:53.117 --> 00:11:54.855
- Hey, how are you?
- Come on in,


248
00:11:54.855 --> 00:11:55.941
come on in, have a seat.

249
00:11:55.941 --> 00:11:56.952
Say, how you been?

250
00:11:56.952 --> 00:11:58.914
All right, all right, all right now.

251
00:11:58.914 --> 00:12:02.057
- Hey, there, how are you?
- All right, have a seat.


252
00:12:02.057 --> 00:12:03.890
Everybody have a seat.

253
00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:10.342
- So how is everybody doing today?

254
00:12:10.342 --> 00:12:12.474
- Everybody's great, everybody's great.

255
00:12:12.474 --> 00:12:15.135
We're excited to go over all the companies

256
00:12:15.135 --> 00:12:17.259
trying to inline in your brand, OK?

257
00:12:17.259 --> 00:12:19.909
If you guys don't mind,
I'm gonna let Ida go over


258
00:12:19.909 --> 00:12:21.433
everything, and take the stage.

259
00:12:21.433 --> 00:12:23.499
- Hi, Zaytoven.
- Hey.


260
00:12:23.499 --> 00:12:26.637
- Thanks for coming in, everybody.

261
00:12:26.637 --> 00:12:31.196
All right, so let's get
right into it, shall we?


262
00:12:31.196 --> 00:12:32.196
Game cigars.

263
00:12:33.067 --> 00:12:35.270
New to the market, looking for ad space

264
00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:39.090
in your current college tour you're doing.

265
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.840
- That's cool, but I don't smoke.

266
00:12:42.897 --> 00:12:44.620
- That's fine, you don't have to smoke.

267
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.801
- We straight.
- Yeah, let's move on.


268
00:12:46.801 --> 00:12:48.302
- OK.

269
00:12:48.302 --> 00:12:51.443
Next product we have is
called Capture Me in 3D.


270
00:12:51.443 --> 00:12:54.321
It specializes in mobile 3D technology

271
00:12:54.321 --> 00:12:58.199
that specializes in
bringing physical objects


272
00:12:58.199 --> 00:13:00.100
and people into the digital world,

273
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.387
and we have a brand new
product just for you.


274
00:13:06.693 --> 00:13:08.193
- Yeah, it's cute.

275
00:13:14.775 --> 00:13:16.439
- All right.

276
00:13:16.439 --> 00:13:19.392
Next one we got is EA
Sports for exclusive music


277
00:13:19.392 --> 00:13:20.403
for new titles.

278
00:13:20.403 --> 00:13:23.867
- Man, yes, Bree is gonna
love that, I know it.


279
00:13:23.867 --> 00:13:25.541
Like, for real.
- Great.


280
00:13:25.541 --> 00:13:27.233
Well, Derek has two soundtrack offers

281
00:13:27.233 --> 00:13:29.416
and you're not returning any event stems

282
00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:31.942
for DJ rockstars EDM project either.

283
00:13:31.942 --> 00:13:33.442
- See, I told you.

284
00:13:35.141 --> 00:13:36.488
- What about Apple?

285
00:13:36.488 --> 00:13:38.639
Tell him about Apple.

286
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:41.256
- Apple is close,
but they need more time.

287
00:13:41.256 --> 00:13:43.787
- I don't think they want
to do an exclusive deal


288
00:13:43.787 --> 00:13:46.773
if Zay still sells
cheaper beats to indies.


289
00:13:46.773 --> 00:13:49.941
- Hold on, that shouldn't
have nothing to do


290
00:13:49.941 --> 00:13:52.645
with what I sell to the major labels.

291
00:13:52.645 --> 00:13:54.228
- But Zay, it does.

292
00:13:56.763 --> 00:13:58.085
It's hard for me to convince the majors

293
00:13:58.085 --> 00:14:02.354
to spend $600,000 quarterly
on your sound kits


294
00:14:02.354 --> 00:14:05.445
if you're selling them to
your cousin in the hood


295
00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:07.479
for just a couple hundred bucks.

296
00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:10.039
- Well, technically, Mr. Diamond,

297
00:14:10.039 --> 00:14:12.846
it's not just a couple hundred bucks.

298
00:14:12.846 --> 00:14:16.111
- Listen, these are people
that Zaytoven considers


299
00:14:16.111 --> 00:14:17.703
friends and family.

300
00:14:17.703 --> 00:14:20.381
We got to make this
work, like, we got to.

301
00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:22.086
- But it might not work
because they don't continue


302
00:14:22.086 --> 00:14:24.358
to sell records, the brand
will continue to deteriorate.


303
00:14:24.358 --> 00:14:28.127
So I suggest you reconsider
how you do favors for friends.


304
00:14:28.127 --> 00:14:30.313
- Miss, do you know
that I got five songs

305
00:14:30.313 --> 00:14:32.622
in the hot 100 right now?

306
00:14:32.622 --> 00:14:35.746
- Three of which is in
the top 10 right now,


307
00:14:35.746 --> 00:14:37.377
back to back?
- Preach.


308
00:14:37.377 --> 00:14:38.423
- So wait a minute.

309
00:14:38.423 --> 00:14:42.090
So you telling me, all
I can sell is blunts?


310
00:14:43.224 --> 00:14:45.712
Like what happened to Microsoft and Beats

311
00:14:45.712 --> 00:14:48.584
and all the big major
companies y'all promised me


312
00:14:48.584 --> 00:14:51.411
when I first signed up to this company?

313
00:14:51.411 --> 00:14:52.831
- I say we take
this show on the road.

314
00:14:52.831 --> 00:14:55.365
How about we go to Jessie
there at IM and really


315
00:14:55.365 --> 00:14:57.144
see what's going on,
you know what I mean?

316
00:14:57.144 --> 00:14:58.677
- No need for threats.

317
00:14:58.677 --> 00:15:00.654
We all want what's best.

318
00:15:00.654 --> 00:15:03.826
- Listen, just tell him the truth.

319
00:15:03.826 --> 00:15:05.791
- Tell me what?
- Tell him.


320
00:15:05.791 --> 00:15:07.229
He need to hear this.

321
00:15:07.229 --> 00:15:10.137
- Look, it's hard to brand you.

322
00:15:10.137 --> 00:15:11.909
- Sure, you're the hottest producer out,

323
00:15:11.909 --> 00:15:13.891
but you're not relating to your core demo,

324
00:15:13.891 --> 00:15:17.449
which is criminals, drug
dealers, and street thugs.


325
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:18.911
You don't apply to any of that,

326
00:15:18.911 --> 00:15:21.827
so how do we market you
outside of beats, Zay?


327
00:15:21.827 --> 00:15:23.160
How do we do it?

328
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.294
- So you, wait
a minute, so you saying

329
00:15:26.294 --> 00:15:29.211
that if I'm not strung out on dope,

330
00:15:30.184 --> 00:15:34.478
if I'm not on social media
going crazy acting stupid,


331
00:15:34.478 --> 00:15:36.042
then I'm not marketable?

332
00:15:36.042 --> 00:15:37.812
- Pretty much.
- It's not that


333
00:15:37.812 --> 00:15:39.841
cut and dry, Zay.

334
00:15:39.841 --> 00:15:42.715
It's a lot more complex than that.

335
00:15:42.715 --> 00:15:46.382
See, your lifestyle is
kind of quiet, right?


336
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:50.655
I believe if we just
spruce it up a bit,

337
00:15:50.655 --> 00:15:54.292
you know, build it a little
bit, let me ask you something,


338
00:15:54.292 --> 00:15:55.445
are you married?

339
00:15:55.445 --> 00:15:56.774
- I'm engaged.

340
00:15:56.774 --> 00:15:59.189
- Great, have an affair.
- Yes.


341
00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:01.481
Have an affair, have an affair.

342
00:16:01.481 --> 00:16:04.208
- Wait a minute, man.
- Great idea.


343
00:16:04.208 --> 00:16:05.709
- Listen, bro.

344
00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:08.514
We not here to put
on no damn clown suit.

345
00:16:08.514 --> 00:16:11.342
Like, come on, we ain't
here for the monkey shit.


346
00:16:11.342 --> 00:16:12.914
Come on now.

347
00:16:12.914 --> 00:16:14.673
- You're looking at it all wrong.

348
00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.787
- No, Mr. Diamond, all due respect,

349
00:16:16.787 --> 00:16:18.512
you're looking at it all wrong.

350
00:16:18.512 --> 00:16:20.680
Matter of fact, all y'all
looking at it all wrong.


351
00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.114
It seem like y'all know
nothing about Zaytoven


352
00:16:23.114 --> 00:16:25.568
or the real trap guy.

353
00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:28.127
To be truthful, y'all sounding
like culture vultures.


354
00:16:28.127 --> 00:16:29.297
For real.

355
00:16:29.297 --> 00:16:30.382
Lady, I tell you what.

356
00:16:30.382 --> 00:16:31.372
Ida.

357
00:16:31.372 --> 00:16:33.379
How about you go tell your daughter

358
00:16:33.379 --> 00:16:35.822
to go shake her ass on the
pole to become a brand?


359
00:16:35.822 --> 00:16:37.492
- Hold on, listen.

360
00:16:37.492 --> 00:16:40.290
With all due respect, it's
called marketing your brand.


361
00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:41.946
- And we market.

362
00:16:41.946 --> 00:16:43.648
It's nothing personal.

363
00:16:43.648 --> 00:16:46.254
Look, Zaytoven, it don't
matter if I'm trying


364
00:16:46.254 --> 00:16:49.362
to sell cattle to cowboys
eating slaw on the plow


365
00:16:49.362 --> 00:16:50.859
looking for a new gun to hunt with

366
00:16:50.859 --> 00:16:54.343
or the trapper on the
street corner with a gun,


367
00:16:54.343 --> 00:16:56.148
an iPhone, and a few
grams of weed to smoke,


368
00:16:56.148 --> 00:16:58.214
it's my job to make sure
he's smoking the blunts


369
00:16:58.214 --> 00:17:00.318
that I represent.

370
00:17:00.318 --> 00:17:01.682
- What is you talking about?

371
00:17:01.682 --> 00:17:03.510
- Look, it's life, get over it.

372
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:06.458
No, look, who do you
think cons and crackers


373
00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:08.480
are listening to?

374
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.506
Huh?

375
00:17:09.506 --> 00:17:10.339
Zaytoven.

376
00:17:11.204 --> 00:17:13.010
We need market share.

377
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.610
- And I understand that.

378
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:19.544
But I'm not gonna endorse
nothing that I don't do.


379
00:17:19.544 --> 00:17:22.782
I don't smoke and I don't drink.

380
00:17:22.782 --> 00:17:24.880
Can we leave this meeting please?

381
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.531
Johnny.

382
00:17:26.531 --> 00:17:27.364
- Man.

383
00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.315
- Could you think about
Zaytoven before you start


384
00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:31.983
thinking about a dollar, please?

385
00:17:31.983 --> 00:17:34.346
- Zay, hold up, wait
a minute, man, listen,


386
00:17:34.346 --> 00:17:37.078
it took me two months
to set this meeting up.


387
00:17:37.078 --> 00:17:38.846
Man, hello, wait.

388
00:17:38.846 --> 00:17:40.278
Man, y'all see what y'all done,

389
00:17:40.278 --> 00:17:43.445
y'all messed this whole thing up, man.

390
00:17:44.874 --> 00:17:47.216
- I don't want to
get on the stinky bus.

391
00:17:47.216 --> 00:17:48.928
- We have to get on the bus.
- I don't want to


392
00:17:48.928 --> 00:17:50.994
ride on the stinky bus.

393
00:17:50.994 --> 00:17:52.383
- Now.

394
00:17:52.383 --> 00:17:54.806
We're going to get on the bus
so we can go get some money.


395
00:17:54.806 --> 00:17:58.153
I don't want to get on
the stupid bus either.


396
00:17:58.153 --> 00:17:59.376
- I don't want
to get on the bus.

397
00:17:59.376 --> 00:18:01.626
- We got to get on the bus.

398
00:18:03.488 --> 00:18:05.162
- I'm hungry.
- We're gonna get


399
00:18:05.162 --> 00:18:08.885
some food, we have to go get
some money to get some food.


400
00:18:08.885 --> 00:18:10.385
Give me your hand.

401
00:18:30.543 --> 00:18:33.686
- What are they doing?
- I do not know.


402
00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.799
- Go, go, go.

403
00:18:43.982 --> 00:18:46.351
- Man, this nigga phone keep ringing.

404
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:47.714
- Tell him.

405
00:18:52.193 --> 00:18:55.628
- Yo, Zay, your phone keep ringing.

406
00:19:00.478 --> 00:19:03.444
- Yo, yo, Carl, what up, man?

407
00:19:03.444 --> 00:19:04.740
Boy, I see you keep
calling me back to back,


408
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.984
so it gotta be some good news.

409
00:19:05.984 --> 00:19:07.172
- I wish.

410
00:19:07.172 --> 00:19:08.821
Only if you answer your phone calls.

411
00:19:08.821 --> 00:19:11.463
Or I got it, how about
you answer your e-mails?


412
00:19:11.463 --> 00:19:12.971
- Johnny Holla
hasn't hit you back yet?


413
00:19:12.971 --> 00:19:14.535
- Nah, Johnny didn't.

414
00:19:14.535 --> 00:19:16.551
And Newt, I hear
you got him out looking

415
00:19:16.551 --> 00:19:17.890
for a new label deal.

416
00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:20.050
That's what I'm here for, Zay.
- Listen, Carl,


417
00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.628
when I told you I wanted
to start me a label,


418
00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:24.725
you promised me that you
were gonna bring that shit


419
00:19:24.725 --> 00:19:26.563
right to my doorstep.

420
00:19:26.563 --> 00:19:28.484
- I will, I will.

421
00:19:28.484 --> 00:19:30.104
In time, Zay.

422
00:19:30.104 --> 00:19:32.346
I'm in LA reading
Universal in a bidding war.


423
00:19:32.346 --> 00:19:35.324
- Hey, Amos, pick, come on, man.

424
00:19:35.324 --> 00:19:37.227
- How'd that
meeting go with big biz?


425
00:19:37.227 --> 00:19:38.481
- Same old, same old.

426
00:19:38.481 --> 00:19:40.265
They want me to be a mascot.

427
00:19:40.265 --> 00:19:41.516
I just want to do some music,

428
00:19:41.516 --> 00:19:43.730
they want me to be a clown.

429
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.897
- Hey, have you heard of Trisha Davis?

430
00:19:48.253 --> 00:19:51.268
- You can't let him score like that.

431
00:19:51.268 --> 00:19:53.160
No, who that?

432
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.696
- Well.

433
00:19:54.696 --> 00:19:57.412
Miss Davis is a sister of Brandon Davis.

434
00:19:57.412 --> 00:20:00.082
Apparently you signed a deal
with him a few years back.


435
00:20:00.082 --> 00:20:02.415
- No.
- Just filed a lawsuit.


436
00:20:03.653 --> 00:20:06.356
She's suing you, the publisher, and Gucci.

437
00:20:06.356 --> 00:20:09.474
- That sound crazy.
- Not crazy at all.


438
00:20:09.474 --> 00:20:12.142
She's probably the
biggest firm in Atlanta.


439
00:20:12.142 --> 00:20:13.848
Brooks and Bailey.

440
00:20:13.848 --> 00:20:16.163
So, either she has the
money to fight this,


441
00:20:16.163 --> 00:20:18.266
or Bailey thinks she's got a good case.

442
00:20:18.266 --> 00:20:19.400
Because it takes an arm and a leg

443
00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.512
to hold them on a retainer.
- Hey, listen.


444
00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:22.864
I don't know who that is,

445
00:20:22.864 --> 00:20:24.457
I ain't sign nothing with none of them.

446
00:20:24.457 --> 00:20:26.483
You make sure you stay on
top of that, all right?


447
00:20:26.483 --> 00:20:27.662
- I will.

448
00:20:27.662 --> 00:20:31.329
You need to give me
some time to figure out.


449
00:20:32.718 --> 00:20:33.551

461
00:21:40.116 --> 00:21:41.890
How are you, how are you?

462
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.193
- Wonderful, wonderful.

463
00:21:43.193 --> 00:21:45.691
I see you guys next week.

464
00:21:45.691 --> 00:21:47.111
- What's up, Jess, how you doing, bro?

465
00:21:47.111 --> 00:21:48.481
- Oh, man, I'm good, what's up, buddy?

466
00:21:48.481 --> 00:21:49.761
- Kick it away for a minute.

467
00:21:49.761 --> 00:21:51.673
- Hey, man, the choir sounds great.

468
00:21:51.673 --> 00:21:53.603
- Sounding good, you see
it, you see what going on.


469
00:21:53.603 --> 00:21:55.071
- Did you stop coordinating?

470
00:21:55.071 --> 00:21:57.717
- Yeah, man, you know, it
sound a whole lot better


471
00:21:57.717 --> 00:21:58.815
now that you gone.

472
00:22:00.249 --> 00:22:01.257
- That's funny, man.

473
00:22:01.257 --> 00:22:02.668
I actually made you sound better.

474
00:22:02.668 --> 00:22:05.138
- Hey, sister, how you doing?

475
00:22:05.138 --> 00:22:06.136
- I'm good.

476
00:22:06.136 --> 00:22:08.544
We need to pay Calloway today.

477
00:22:08.544 --> 00:22:10.800
- Not today, these mortgage
companies and interest rates


478
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.098
keep going up, not today,

479
00:22:13.098 --> 00:22:15.360
this is no church paying bill today.

480
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:17.008
- How you still find the
time for all this, man,


481
00:22:17.008 --> 00:22:18.506
after, you know?

482
00:22:18.506 --> 00:22:20.243
- Oh, man, it's easy, it
ain't really no big thing.


483
00:22:20.243 --> 00:22:22.369
You find time for
what you want to do.

484
00:22:22.369 --> 00:22:24.633
And you know I bought
into this place, too.


485
00:22:24.633 --> 00:22:26.895
- Hey, well, you know, that's
always been your calling.


486
00:22:26.895 --> 00:22:27.728
- Yeah, it has.

487
00:22:27.728 --> 00:22:29.241
See, right here, what's going on.

488
00:22:29.241 --> 00:22:30.846
- What's up, man?
- Pastor, how you doing?


489
00:22:30.846 --> 00:22:32.521
- How you doing, man,
good to see you, brother.


490
00:22:32.521 --> 00:22:33.538
All right, man.

491
00:22:33.538 --> 00:22:35.514
I heard you're doing great
things up there in Ohio, man,


492
00:22:35.514 --> 00:22:37.133
still playing big things up there.

493
00:22:37.133 --> 00:22:38.125
- Definitely, man, you know.

494
00:22:38.125 --> 00:22:40.003
We just growing and expanding up that way.

495
00:22:40.003 --> 00:22:41.825
- OK.
- I see the church, man.


496
00:22:41.825 --> 00:22:43.421
It's looking marvelous, man.

497
00:22:43.421 --> 00:22:44.865
- Oh, great, appreciate
it, man, thanks a lot.


498
00:22:44.865 --> 00:22:46.544
- God has been doing great things, huh.

499
00:22:46.544 --> 00:22:48.165
- Y'all go ahead, I'm
gonna catch up with y'all


500
00:22:48.165 --> 00:22:49.693
in a minute, I got
to get out of here, OK?

501
00:22:49.693 --> 00:22:50.675
- All right.
- See ya.


502
00:22:50.675 --> 00:22:53.750
- Jess.
- Same number, right?


503
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.012
- Got the same number, hit me up.

504
00:22:55.012 --> 00:22:55.976
- All right, I'll call you.

505
00:22:58.281 --> 00:22:59.635
- Yeah, come on, have a seat, brother.

506
00:22:59.635 --> 00:23:01.135
- Of course.
- So good to see you, man.


507
00:23:01.135 --> 00:23:02.239
- So good to see you, too.

508
00:23:02.239 --> 00:23:03.915
- All right, man, so
how's everything going?


509
00:23:03.915 --> 00:23:05.324
- Oh, everything is well, man.

510
00:23:05.324 --> 00:23:07.026
You guys have really stepped
it up around here, man.


511
00:23:07.026 --> 00:23:10.246
- Yeah, man, you know,
the Lord is good, man.


512
00:23:10.246 --> 00:23:13.867
I remember when we had 85
members and now we just,


513
00:23:13.867 --> 00:23:15.447
we growing a little bit, man.

514
00:23:15.447 --> 00:23:16.800
- God is doing great things.

515
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.869
You guys are sitting
over, what, two acres now?


516
00:23:18.869 --> 00:23:21.589
- Oh, yeah, well, you know,
God has been good to us.


517
00:23:21.589 --> 00:23:22.769
He's seen my vision.

518
00:23:22.769 --> 00:23:26.539
I'm getting all the support
I need, so, you know,


519
00:23:26.539 --> 00:23:28.316
I feel real good about it, you know.

520
00:23:28.316 --> 00:23:30.216
Just trying to do his will.

521
00:23:30.216 --> 00:23:31.367
- Definitely.

522
00:23:31.367 --> 00:23:32.633
I think his will is more.

523
00:23:34.084 --> 00:23:35.319
Oh, are you OK?

524
00:23:35.319 --> 00:23:37.284
Pastor, Pastor?
- Yeah, I'm all right.


525
00:23:37.284 --> 00:23:39.199
- You good?
- Yeah, must be the weather


526
00:23:39.199 --> 00:23:40.268
or something, man.

527
00:23:40.268 --> 00:23:41.918
Listen, what are you doing right now?

528
00:23:41.918 --> 00:23:44.035
- I have nothing going on after this.

529
00:23:44.035 --> 00:23:45.865
- I need to
go pick up my medicine,

530
00:23:45.865 --> 00:23:46.965
can you take me?

531
00:23:46.965 --> 00:23:47.970
- Of course I can.

532
00:23:49.738 --> 00:23:52.467
You gonna be all right?

533
00:24:14.073 --> 00:24:15.847
- That's a mother fucker right there, boy,

534
00:24:15.847 --> 00:24:17.335
that's a mother fucking
single right there,


535
00:24:17.335 --> 00:24:18.546

536
00:24:18.546 --> 00:24:20.304
that that mother fucker, god damn.

537
00:24:20.304 --> 00:24:23.551
- Y'all boys got
a bang on that one.

538
00:24:23.551 --> 00:24:25.211
And it ain't even gotta be mixed.

539
00:24:25.211 --> 00:24:28.202
All I gotta do is turn the
drums up just a little bit,


540
00:24:28.202 --> 00:24:30.166
slap a little reverb on it,

541
00:24:30.166 --> 00:24:32.469
and that guy is out of here.

542
00:24:32.469 --> 00:24:34.290
- Yo, yo, see this shit?

543
00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.367
Pauly just shot another
million walking, man.


544
00:24:37.367 --> 00:24:39.429
Family and all, man.

545
00:24:39.429 --> 00:24:40.993
- Tour going crazy right now.

546
00:24:40.993 --> 00:24:43.441
Her niggas and shit.

547
00:24:43.441 --> 00:24:44.445
- Shit crazy.

548
00:24:44.445 --> 00:24:46.523
Pulling motherfucking

549
00:24:46.523 --> 00:24:49.905
get out of there, man,
throwing bombs and everything.


550
00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:51.238
That shit crazy.

551
00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.399
- Yeah, that's why I'm staying,

552
00:24:53.399 --> 00:24:56.208
I'mma bust one of the
mother fucker try me.


553
00:24:56.208 --> 00:24:58.371
- Let me see that, though.

554
00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:01.486
- Yes, I will, sir, I'll
keep my hands where they are.


555
00:25:01.486 --> 00:25:04.736
- Dang, the police is not playing, boy.

556
00:25:06.072 --> 00:25:08.235
They zero tolerance.

557
00:25:08.235 --> 00:25:09.854
- Man, this shit crazy out here, man.

558
00:25:09.854 --> 00:25:12.246
Seems like this shit
getting worse and worse.


559
00:25:12.246 --> 00:25:13.759
It's all out of shape, man.

560
00:25:13.759 --> 00:25:15.469
- I'm telling you man, in the trunk,

561
00:25:15.469 --> 00:25:18.457
really play it safe out here for real

562
00:25:18.457 --> 00:25:21.448
fucking around with that cracker, man.

563
00:25:21.448 --> 00:25:24.169
- No, for real,
but at the same time,

564
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:26.835
we got to act
like we got some sense,

565
00:25:26.835 --> 00:25:27.951
because you know what I mean,

566
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:29.774
we got to, you see all
these folks going crazy,


567
00:25:29.774 --> 00:25:33.784
they looking at World Star,
they watching YouTube videos,


568
00:25:33.784 --> 00:25:37.738
we got guns, we
got drugs, and all that,

569
00:25:37.738 --> 00:25:39.802
so you got to think that
they gonna get scared


570
00:25:39.802 --> 00:25:41.060
when they see that stuff.

571
00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:43.155
- Yeah, they better be scared
because I'm on high alert


572
00:25:43.155 --> 00:25:45.417
right now, I'm gonna bust something.

573
00:25:45.417 --> 00:25:46.895
- Yeah, for real.

574
00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:50.708
- Yo.
- Zaytoven, you have a guest


575
00:25:50.708 --> 00:25:52.291
in the front.
- Who?


576
00:25:53.153 --> 00:25:54.869
I ain't told nobody I was up here.

577
00:25:54.869 --> 00:25:56.324
- Hey, that shit so crazy.

578
00:25:56.324 --> 00:25:58.739
Too sweet right now.

579
00:25:58.739 --> 00:26:01.313
Yeah, they got around one time, boy.

580
00:26:01.313 --> 00:26:03.873
You see what going on.

581
00:26:03.873 --> 00:26:05.935
Where Zay at, man?

582
00:26:05.935 --> 00:26:07.435
What's up, my boy?

583
00:26:08.517 --> 00:26:09.350
What's up?

584
00:26:11.517 --> 00:26:14.449
I got a beat for you, bro.

585
00:26:14.449 --> 00:26:15.454
Brand new flavor.

586
00:26:15.454 --> 00:26:17.506
I got a drop CD
last time I seen you.

587
00:26:17.506 --> 00:26:19.069
Yeah, man, I know you
probably ain't got a chance


588
00:26:19.069 --> 00:26:20.273
to check it out.

589
00:26:20.273 --> 00:26:21.786
This a whole new load, though.

590
00:26:21.786 --> 00:26:22.839
About 20 of them guys.

591
00:26:22.839 --> 00:26:25.273
- You doing way too much.

592
00:26:25.273 --> 00:26:26.507
You're doing too much.

593
00:26:26.507 --> 00:26:28.988
You follow me or something?

594
00:26:28.988 --> 00:26:30.956
How you know I was up here?

595
00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:34.025
- Bro, you were all just on
Instagram, Sound, Snapchat,


596
00:26:34.025 --> 00:26:35.646
I don't know what you mean, Periscoping.

597
00:26:35.646 --> 00:26:37.594
- Hold a second, you didn't
even know he was coming?


598
00:26:37.594 --> 00:26:38.944
- I knew him for life, I knew--

599
00:26:38.944 --> 00:26:40.080
- You gotta go, you gotta go.

600
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.803
Come on, man, hold up.

601
00:26:41.803 --> 00:26:44.208
- Let him talk, go ahead,
talk, let me see what


602
00:26:44.208 --> 00:26:45.356
he got to say.
- I'm trying to win,


603
00:26:45.356 --> 00:26:46.895
brother, give them Himalayan beats away.

604
00:26:46.895 --> 00:26:48.551
You see.
- No, I didn't get


605
00:26:48.551 --> 00:26:49.821
a chance to listen to them yet,

606
00:26:49.821 --> 00:26:50.936
but check it out, you can't
be popping up on me like that.


607
00:26:50.936 --> 00:26:53.712
I don't like that, I
don't like that at all.


608
00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:55.665
- Wrap it up, let's go,
let's go, come on, beef.


609
00:27:06.307 --> 00:27:07.507
- New flavor.

610
00:27:07.507 --> 00:27:08.509
I got one for you, too.

611
00:27:08.509 --> 00:27:09.519
I gave the boys one.

612
00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:11.209
They different, though, all different.

613
00:27:11.209 --> 00:27:12.867
You hear me.

614
00:27:22.178 --> 00:27:24.436
One second, one second.

615
00:27:24.436 --> 00:27:25.738
- No, no, no, no.

616
00:27:25.738 --> 00:27:27.516
No, no, no, no.
- We ain't taking


617
00:27:27.516 --> 00:27:28.850
no picture, bro.

618
00:27:32.434 --> 00:27:33.768
- Wait a minute, what
are all you nigga doing,


619
00:27:33.768 --> 00:27:35.346
get one real quick for the crown, man.

620
00:27:38.459 --> 00:27:40.581
All right, man, it's all
good, you all hold it down,


621
00:27:40.581 --> 00:27:41.719
all right?

622
00:27:41.719 --> 00:27:43.722
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna see you though, Zay.

623
00:27:43.722 --> 00:27:45.077
I'm gonna see ya.

624
00:27:45.077 --> 00:27:46.660
I'm mad to see you.

625
00:27:50.121 --> 00:27:51.954
- Time for lunch, man.

626
00:27:53.793 --> 00:27:55.963
- Yeah, it's big
door blasting Club Silo.


627
00:27:55.963 --> 00:27:57.469
The line is wrapped around the corner.

628
00:27:57.469 --> 00:27:59.052
It's a zoo outside.

629
00:28:02.062 --> 00:28:03.502
Fellas, you better make your way down here

630
00:28:03.502 --> 00:28:05.606
because it's wall to wall
ladies in the building.


631

- What's up, where
do I know you from?

649
00:29:07.336 --> 00:29:08.943
- You're gonna act like
you don't know me, Trish?


650
00:29:08.943 --> 00:29:10.276
Black's ex wife?

651
00:29:12.797 --> 00:29:15.297
- You say Black?
- Yeah, Black.


652
00:29:17.009 --> 00:29:18.923
The key to your success.

653
00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:22.008
Come on, give me
some of that money back.

654
00:29:22.008 --> 00:29:23.837
Nigga, you owe me some money.

655
00:29:23.837 --> 00:29:25.634
You ain't been answering me on Instagram.

656
00:29:25.634 --> 00:29:26.812
What's good?

657
00:29:26.812 --> 00:29:28.524
- Man, you know, like on Instagram,

658
00:29:28.524 --> 00:29:30.250
I've got like 2,000,000
followers, I don't really


659
00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:33.032

660
00:29:33.032 --> 00:29:35.032
that was my man, though.

661
00:29:35.032 --> 00:29:36.726
So wait a minute, that was you?

662
00:29:36.726 --> 00:29:39.830
- Yeah, that was me, the lawsuit.

663
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.662
You need to run me some
of that money, Zay.


664
00:29:42.662 --> 00:29:43.913
- What you talking about?

665
00:29:43.913 --> 00:29:45.205
- You know you owe Black some money,

666
00:29:45.205 --> 00:29:47.592
you owe me money, and you
owe my kids some money,


667
00:29:47.592 --> 00:29:49.697
so run me my motherfucking money.

668
00:29:49.697 --> 00:29:51.479
- Hey, hey, what's up,
what, you want a picture


669
00:29:51.479 --> 00:29:53.903
or something?
- Nigga, fuck a pig.


670
00:29:53.903 --> 00:29:55.557
You gonna act all Hollywood?

671
00:29:55.557 --> 00:29:57.839
You done brought me
money in time for Black.


672
00:29:57.839 --> 00:30:00.135
- Oh, shit, what's up, Trish, baby.

673
00:30:00.135 --> 00:30:02.134
- Nigga, fuck a hug.

674
00:30:02.134 --> 00:30:03.802
And fuck you, Zay, 
I'm tired of you trying

675
00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:05.300
to play me because I'm a female.

676
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.366
I got my brother
on your head, too, nigga.

677
00:30:07.366 --> 00:30:09.078
- Hey, bitch, fuck your
motherfucking brother.


678
00:30:09.078 --> 00:30:11.980
- Fuck you and fuck Zay
and fuck all you niggas.


679
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.592
Why you trying to play me?

680
00:30:28.784 --> 00:30:32.792
- Hey, what was
up with that girl, man?

681
00:30:32.792 --> 00:30:35.446
- I think this bitch know something.

682
00:30:35.446 --> 00:30:36.613
- You tell me.

683
00:30:40.274 --> 00:30:43.876
- Either way, fuck it,
nigga, we up, man, fuck that.


684
00:30:43.876 --> 00:30:45.074
And fuck her.

685
00:31:03.582 --> 00:31:04.612
- Hold up.
- What's going on,


686
00:31:04.612 --> 00:31:05.899
man, I'm late for
training, you blocking me.


687
00:31:05.899 --> 00:31:07.256
- It's a no go.
- What you mean?


688
00:31:07.256 --> 00:31:08.255
I got to train, man.

689
00:31:08.255 --> 00:31:09.263
- Not here you don't.

690
00:31:09.263 --> 00:31:11.978
Rock released you from your contract.

691
00:31:11.978 --> 00:31:13.145
- He did what?

692
00:31:14.014 --> 00:31:15.580
Motherfucker did what?

693
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.631
What the fuck do you mean
released me from my contract?


694
00:31:17.631 --> 00:31:19.606
Do you know who I am, man?

695
00:31:19.606 --> 00:31:22.572
I'm Statewide Junior,
middle weight champion.


696
00:31:22.572 --> 00:31:25.405
- Ex champion who lost to a scrub.

697
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:28.153
Rock said call him next week, maybe y'all

698
00:31:28.153 --> 00:31:30.483
can discuss a buy out.

699
00:31:30.483 --> 00:31:33.157
Matter of fact, probably
best you e-mail him.


700
00:31:33.157 --> 00:31:35.460
- Man, this how y'all treat
your talent around here?


701
00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.085
- Any human sources issues you having?

702
00:31:38.085 --> 00:31:41.715
- It's human resources
you dumb motherfucker.


703
00:31:41.715 --> 00:31:43.044
Get the fuck out of my way, man.

704
00:31:43.044 --> 00:31:44.666
- Back the fuck up, home boy,

705
00:31:44.666 --> 00:31:48.096
before I open hand
slap the fuck out you.

706
00:31:48.096 --> 00:31:49.488
- OK.

707
00:31:49.488 --> 00:31:51.882
Fuck you and fuck Rock, too.

708
00:31:51.882 --> 00:31:53.529
Y'all running a fake ass gym, anyway,

709
00:31:53.529 --> 00:31:54.945
in this motherfucker.

710
00:31:54.945 --> 00:31:56.917
Selling dope and shit.

711
00:31:56.917 --> 00:32:00.084
Should shoot you motherfucking niggas.

712
00:32:14.678 --> 00:32:16.064
- Hey, Amanda, you can't go back there--

713
00:32:16.064 --> 00:32:18.481
- Get the fuck out of my way.

714
00:32:26.796 --> 00:32:28.301
- Close the door.

715
00:32:28.301 --> 00:32:31.301
I said close the motherfucking door.

716
00:32:33.218 --> 00:32:34.814
- You got to look
on the good side now,

717
00:32:34.814 --> 00:32:36.264
at least he didn't
do it in the bed.

718
00:32:36.264 --> 00:32:37.802
- If that's the good side then
why don't you let him do it


719
00:32:37.802 --> 00:32:38.778
in your motherfucking bed?

720
00:32:38.778 --> 00:32:40.322
- Come on, you got to
be more positive, man.


721
00:32:40.322 --> 00:32:41.568
- I got your positive.

722
00:32:41.568 --> 00:32:44.286
You tell his ass, he done
fucked with the right one.


723
00:32:44.286 --> 00:32:45.619
And he knows it.

724
00:32:47.393 --> 00:32:48.226
Oh, Trish.

725
00:32:49.408 --> 00:32:50.976
Long time.

726
00:32:50.976 --> 00:32:52.507
- Well, hello to you, too, Amanda.

727
00:32:52.507 --> 00:32:53.797
- When you see
your brother, let him know

728
00:32:53.797 --> 00:32:56.457
that the next time I see
him, it will be in court


729
00:32:56.457 --> 00:32:57.374
or in jail.

730
00:32:58.309 --> 00:32:59.605
And hey.

731
00:32:59.605 --> 00:33:02.272
Either way, I don't give a fuck.

732
00:33:03.801 --> 00:33:04.801
- Oh my God.

733
00:33:06.479 --> 00:33:07.312
Not today.

734
00:33:08.496 --> 00:33:09.988
- What up, Trish?
- What you doing


735
00:33:09.988 --> 00:33:11.596
back in Atlanta?

736
00:33:11.596 --> 00:33:13.088
You need some money?

737
00:33:13.088 --> 00:33:15.940
- Trish, that sweatshirt doing
you some justice, for real.


738
00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:16.968
Looking good.

739
00:33:16.968 --> 00:33:17.948
- Don't worry about me.

740
00:33:17.948 --> 00:33:19.047
Where the fuck is my brother at?

741
00:33:19.047 --> 00:33:20.296
What he do now?

742
00:33:20.296 --> 00:33:23.796
- Man, he back
there putting his pants on.

743
00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.757
- Ain't doing nothing but
banging some hood rat.


744
00:33:27.757 --> 00:33:29.459
Some bitch.

745
00:33:29.459 --> 00:33:31.709
Probably one of you niggas.

746
00:33:35.665 --> 00:33:37.248
That fucking whore.

747
00:33:38.329 --> 00:33:39.771
- What?

748
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:41.824
- And your wife just left?

749
00:33:41.824 --> 00:33:44.157
You are so fucking pathetic.

750
00:33:45.726 --> 00:33:48.140
- What, you in town?

751
00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.807
You need some money?

752
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.150
- Here.

753
00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.528
Signed and delivered.

754
00:33:55.528 --> 00:33:56.695
- What's this?

755
00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.685
- That's Black and Zaytoven contract.

756
00:34:01.685 --> 00:34:05.185
My lawyer already sent it over to inquiry.

757
00:34:07.547 --> 00:34:11.066
- About time you
decided to listen to me.

758
00:34:11.066 --> 00:34:12.685
Two years ducking and
hiding, you finally ready


759
00:34:12.685 --> 00:34:15.189
to come back, come get some money?

760
00:34:15.189 --> 00:34:16.022
- I know.

761
00:34:18.152 --> 00:34:20.281
I just had a lot on my mind.

762
00:34:20.281 --> 00:34:22.864
I had to get away for a minute.

763
00:34:26.035 --> 00:34:30.096
Plus, that motherfucker
worth way more money now.


764
00:34:30.096 --> 00:34:32.753
I need you to back
me up on this one.

765
00:34:32.753 --> 00:34:36.234
- We do whatever you want to do.

766
00:34:36.234 --> 00:34:37.401
You know that.

767
00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.650
I just don't need you
running around that money.


768
00:34:45.517 --> 00:34:48.184
- I went to the club last night.

769
00:34:49.451 --> 00:34:52.015
He acts so Hollywood.

770
00:34:52.015 --> 00:34:55.568
He acted like he didn't
even know who I was.


771
00:34:55.568 --> 00:34:58.829
- He's supposed to act like that.

772
00:34:58.829 --> 00:35:00.579
You bad for business.

773
00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.149
I don't want you reaching out anymore.

774
00:35:09.149 --> 00:35:11.317
Let me and an attorney do that.

775
00:35:11.317 --> 00:35:13.475
We'll handle it from here.

776
00:35:13.475 --> 00:35:15.142
- So you got a plan?

777
00:35:18.117 --> 00:35:22.387
- I'm always protecting
my little sister, right?


778
00:35:22.387 --> 00:35:24.394
You know, growing up,
all I wanted to do

779
00:35:24.394 --> 00:35:26.227
was save you and Mama.

780
00:35:27.646 --> 00:35:28.979
That was my job.

781
00:35:30.555 --> 00:35:33.196
- You ran away
every boyfriend I ever had.

782
00:35:33.196 --> 00:35:35.860
- And you had plenty of 'em.

783
00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:39.777
But when you met that
nigga Black, you changed.


784
00:35:40.917 --> 00:35:45.917
You broke Mama's heart
running off with that nigga.


785
00:35:45.957 --> 00:35:47.885
She put clothes on our back,

786
00:35:47.885 --> 00:35:49.493
and for you to just leave here.

787
00:35:49.493 --> 00:35:51.743
- That was the man I loved.

788
00:35:52.747 --> 00:35:57.632
Look, ain't none of us
perfect, and you know that.


789
00:35:57.632 --> 00:36:01.451
Look, all I ask

Or I'm gonna break him.

00:39:03.655 --> 00:39:05.439
What you think of that?

00:39:05.439 --> 00:39:07.203

How about I pay

What you trying to say?

883
00:39:59.584 --> 00:40:01.699
My money ain't good enough?

884
00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.071
All I'm saying, I got the
heat and I got the dough,


885
00:40:03.071 --> 00:40:04.490
my shit ain't good enough?

886
00:40:04.490 --> 00:40:06.045
- Bro, you just
going about it all wrong.

887
00:40:06.045 --> 00:40:06.878
- How about going about
it the wrong way, bro?


888
00:40:06.878 --> 00:40:08.545
I got the heat, bro.

889
00:40:10.552 --> 00:40:13.249
How am I going about it
the wrong way, you tell me.


890
00:40:13.249 --> 00:40:17.082
- First of all, bro, you
can't even afford me.


891
00:40:18.815 --> 00:40:21.352
This man don't know I charge $30,000

892
00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:22.823
to come through the door.

893
00:40:22.823 --> 00:40:24.656
- I tried to tell him.

894
00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:28.615
- You got $5,000 sitting right there.

895
00:40:28.615 --> 00:40:30.528
And you got an attitude.

896
00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:33.538
So you keep your money, I'm straight.

897
00:40:33.538 --> 00:40:34.455

898
00:40:35.522 --> 00:40:37.437
You straight.

899
00:40:37.437 --> 00:40:39.009
When my cousin Black, you won't be doing

901
00:40:40.757 --> 00:40:41.590
- Black?

902
00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:43.292
Black?
- Fuck you talking


903
00:40:43.292 --> 00:40:44.583

- Why you talking


904
00:40:44.583 --> 00:40:46.076
about Black?

905
00:40:46.076 --> 00:40:48.261
Nigga, Black wasn't never in my family.

906
00:40:48.261 --> 00:40:50.884
He was an over the top
thug trying to extort me


907
00:40:50.884 --> 00:40:52.362
for some money.

908
00:40:52.362 --> 00:40:55.262
And you see what happened to him, right?

909
00:40:55.262 --> 00:40:56.248
- True.

910
00:40:56.248 --> 00:40:57.376
Come on, man.
- Fuck all that.


911
00:40:57.376 --> 00:40:59.350
Hey, look, no, fuck all
that, check this out.


912
00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:00.408
Check this out.

913
00:41:00.408 --> 00:41:02.930
You either gonna turn me up, my boy,

914
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.680
or I'm gonna make you turn me up.

915
00:41:06.586 --> 00:41:09.462
I know fool, yeah, 
I know things.

916
00:41:33.299 --> 00:41:35.387
- That was uncalled for, man.

917
00:41:35.387 --> 00:41:39.975
Do you realize that these
are supposed to be fans?


918
00:41:39.975 --> 00:41:42.510
I got too much to lose, bro.

919
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:44.862
Like, I ain't trying to
get tricked off the street.


920
00:41:44.862 --> 00:41:45.966
- Fuck that nigga, man.

921
00:41:45.966 --> 00:41:48.552
- It ain't like it used to be.

922
00:41:48.552 --> 00:41:50.082
Times are changed, all right?

923
00:41:50.082 --> 00:41:52.342
I got a lot going on.

924
00:41:52.342 --> 00:41:56.045
So I can't be worried about
no beef with none of that.


925
00:41:56.045 --> 00:41:58.473
- Bro, you tripping, man.

926
00:41:58.473 --> 00:42:01.825
- Cancel all them shows, all
them little hosted parties


927
00:42:01.825 --> 00:42:03.607
you want me to do, that
I'm supposed to be doing


928
00:42:03.607 --> 00:42:05.048
for that little bit of money,
cancel all of that, all right?


929
00:42:05.048 --> 00:42:09.139
Go back to being in the
studio, I told 'em all


930
00:42:09.139 --> 00:42:11.591
to go home for
about a week or two.

931
00:42:11.591 --> 00:42:14.341
I just need to get my mind right.

932
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:19.261
- Cheers, man, what the fuck?

933
00:42:19.261 --> 00:42:20.294
- What up, dog?

934
00:42:20.294 --> 00:42:21.876
- Same old.
- So where's the thing at?


935
00:42:21.876 --> 00:42:23.796
You doing all right?

936
00:42:23.796 --> 00:42:25.808
- I ain't never need no
security until you start


937
00:42:25.808 --> 00:42:26.641
bringing all them fools around.

938
00:42:26.641 --> 00:42:30.943
So look, all I'm doing
is press and meetings


939
00:42:30.943 --> 00:42:32.144
and that's it.

940
00:42:32.144 --> 00:42:34.044
- Told me to pull up on you.

941
00:42:34.044 --> 00:42:35.096
Told you I was all good, right?

942
00:42:35.096 --> 00:42:37.429
- Let me hit you right back.

943
00:42:42.058 --> 00:42:43.479
- You all right bro?

944
00:42:43.479 --> 00:42:45.709
- Yeah, he told me, shit.

945
00:42:45.709 --> 00:42:47.802
I don't be liking too
many surprises, though.


946
00:42:47.802 --> 00:42:48.635
That nigga ain't tell me all that, though.

947
00:42:48.635 --> 00:42:52.176
- He calls, you ain't
pick up the phone, though.


948
00:42:52.176 --> 00:42:53.972
- For real.
- Here's the money, though.


949
00:42:53.972 --> 00:42:54.805
200,000.

950
00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.138
You got four, right?

951
00:42:58.138 --> 00:42:59.721
- Yeah, I got four.

952
00:43:01.074 --> 00:43:02.654
No, I ain't got to count it, fam.

953
00:43:02.654 --> 00:43:04.809
Trust me, I'm an OG, man, if
you got to count a nigga money,


954
00:43:04.809 --> 00:43:06.360
bring a pistol and all
that, you don't need


955
00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.052
to serve a nigga, dog, you feel me?

956
00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:09.651
You say it's all here, though, right?

957
00:43:09.651 --> 00:43:10.484
- Yeah.

958
00:43:11.876 --> 00:43:14.703
That boy is hated, man,
double food double R.


959
00:43:14.703 --> 00:43:16.933
- Who?
- You know, Little Randy.


960
00:43:16.933 --> 00:43:18.923
Little nigga that made the beats.

961
00:43:18.923 --> 00:43:20.937
- Oh, man, fuck that nigga.

962
00:43:20.937 --> 00:43:22.658
- Randy, all right,
fuck with that for real.


963
00:43:22.658 --> 00:43:26.529
- Zay's 10,000 track right

964
00:43:26.529 --> 00:43:28.035
You know what I mean?
- You know, Zay is gold, man.


965
00:43:28.035 --> 00:43:29.334
You know what I'm saying?

966
00:43:29.334 --> 00:43:31.052
He plugged them niggas, man.

967
00:43:31.052 --> 00:43:33.536
Shit, they might be able
to make something shake.


968
00:43:33.536 --> 00:43:35.510
- Shit, man, nigga ain't
tripping on pulling


969
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.088
a nigga up, but nigga ought
to get hot first, my nigga,


970
00:43:37.088 --> 00:43:39.142
you know what I mean? You
get hot, it's a deal will be,


971
00:43:39.142 --> 00:43:40.466
but it's a process with it.

972
00:43:40.466 --> 00:43:41.476
You got to get hot.

973
00:43:41.476 --> 00:43:42.574
Go through the process.

974
00:43:42.574 --> 00:43:43.934
- Fuck the process, man.

975
00:43:43.934 --> 00:43:46.386
Niggas need that shit like now, man.

976
00:43:46.386 --> 00:43:48.962
Fuck around kill all our competitions.

977
00:43:51.343 --> 00:43:52.593
- Man.

978
00:43:52.593 --> 00:43:54.481
Niggas ain't no cheat code in this fam.

979
00:43:54.481 --> 00:43:56.147
You just got to stay 100 man.

980
00:43:56.147 --> 00:43:57.841
Just make it happen,
you know what I mean?

981
00:43:57.841 --> 00:43:59.049
- True.
- All right.


982
00:43:59.049 --> 00:44:01.381
- Tell nigga stay hit me,
man, you be careful, too.


983
00:44:01.381 --> 00:44:02.799
- For real.

984
00:44:02.799 --> 00:44:03.799
- All right.

985
00:44:20.381 --> 00:44:23.016
- Man, what is this,
like an old folk's home,


986
00:44:23.016 --> 00:44:24.256
a retirement home, what is this, man?

987
00:44:24.256 --> 00:44:25.689
- Come on, man.
- Look.


988
00:44:25.689 --> 00:44:26.944
I've got to go, bro.

989
00:44:26.944 --> 00:44:29.736
I've got Breakfast Club,
I've got Miss Info.


990
00:44:29.736 --> 00:44:31.313
I mean, you need
to get on your job.

991
00:44:31.313 --> 00:44:32.601
Where your people, are they ready?

992
00:44:32.601 --> 00:44:34.107
- I mean, come on, 
Zay, man, listen,

993
00:44:34.107 --> 00:44:35.885
I went through a lot to
set this interview up.


994
00:44:35.885 --> 00:44:37.967
All the greats have been through here.

995
00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:40.926
Jay-Z, Rihanna, Beyonce,
I mean, everybody.


996
00:44:40.926 --> 00:44:42.277
Even Gucci and them
been through here, man.


997
00:44:42.277 --> 00:44:46.007
Listen, we already here
early, the interview


998
00:44:46.007 --> 00:44:48.170
ain't 'til 3:30, just relax.

999
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:49.854
I got you, I promise.

1000
00:44:49.854 --> 00:44:51.880
- Say it, man, 
I got to give someone.

1001
00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:53.638
You know what, can you
get something to eat?


1002
00:44:53.638 --> 00:44:54.832
- Yeah, I can do that.
- Do something.


1003
00:44:54.832 --> 00:44:56.125
- What you want?

1004
00:44:56.125 --> 00:44:57.625
All right, I got you, I got you.

1005
00:44:57.625 --> 00:44:59.959
- This right here is nice, boy.

1006
00:44:59.959 --> 00:45:03.301
I need one of these at the crib.

1007
00:45:03.301 --> 00:45:04.134
Yeah, boy.

1008
00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:07.872
- Hey, how you doing,
what's going on, you Zach?


1009
00:45:07.872 --> 00:45:09.733
- Nice to meet you,
yeah, good to meet you.


1010
00:45:09.733 --> 00:45:11.109
- How you doing, 
I'm the manager.

1011
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:12.327
- Pleasure.
- Yeah, Zay is down there.


1012
00:45:12.327 --> 00:45:15.081
- Hey, Zaytoven, it's good to meet you.

1013
00:45:15.081 --> 00:45:15.914
- Hey, what's going on, how you doing?

1014
00:45:15.914 --> 00:45:16.747
- It's an honor.

1015
00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:18.698
That sounds great, where'd you
learn how to play like that?


1016
00:45:18.698 --> 00:45:20.110
- Oh, you know, I've
been playing all my life


1017
00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:22.719
for real, it's like.

1018
00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:24.556
- OK, cool, I'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.


1019
00:45:24.556 --> 00:45:27.424
I'm Sexton, this is my journalist Ramone.

1020
00:45:27.424 --> 00:45:29.050
- Pleasure, nice to meet you, Zaytoven.

1021
00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:31.643
- All right, so let's get started.

1022
00:45:31.643 --> 00:45:32.983
He's gonna be doing the interview.

1023
00:45:32.983 --> 00:45:34.995
Be good to start
right here, by the piano?

1024
00:45:34.995 --> 00:45:35.995
- I don't see why not.

1025
00:45:35.995 --> 00:45:37.023
- All right, let's get going.

1026
00:45:37.023 --> 00:45:38.106
- Great, I'm ready.

1027
00:45:38.106 --> 00:45:40.668
All right, let's get right to it, then.

1028
00:45:40.668 --> 00:45:41.501
So now, with all the scandals
and all of the rumors


1029
00:45:41.501 --> 00:45:44.382
going on in the industry,
how does Zaytoven


1030
00:45:44.382 --> 00:45:47.578
stay clear of all the scrutiny?

1031
00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:50.299
- Well, what I try to do
is really not get involved


1032
00:45:50.299 --> 00:45:53.582
in the hype of the music
business, you know.


1033
00:45:53.582 --> 00:45:55.928
I make this type
of music, but you know,

1034
00:45:55.928 --> 00:45:58.824
I try not to
let it change my lifestyle.

1035
00:45:58.824 --> 00:46:00.988
- Hmm, that's interesting.

1036
00:46:00.988 --> 00:46:02.506
I read something the other day,

1037
00:46:02.506 --> 00:46:04.774
it said that you were
being sued by the family


1038
00:46:04.774 --> 00:46:07.638
of a fellow band member who
was murdered a few years back.


1039
00:46:07.638 --> 00:46:08.721
Is that true?

1040
00:46:10.176 --> 00:46:12.518
- That's the first time I heard that.

1041
00:46:12.518 --> 00:46:14.046
- That's interesting, as
well, because they say


1042
00:46:14.046 --> 00:46:16.821
that he was quite relevant
to your career, actually.


1043
00:46:16.821 --> 00:46:19.355
He was mysteriously murdered.

1044
00:46:19.355 --> 00:46:22.257
Internet trolls say that it
was ,


1045
00:46:22.257 --> 00:46:24.298
as if it was a sacrifice.

1046
00:46:24.298 --> 00:46:27.652
- Man, look, I don't believe
in nothing like that.


1047
00:46:27.652 --> 00:46:29.470
I don't think you need to, either.

1048
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:31.150
- Come on, now, I know
how 50 50 music group


1049
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:34.373
doing everything, but
hey, can we please stick


1050
00:46:34.373 --> 00:46:35.907
to the script, please?

1051
00:46:35.907 --> 00:46:39.092
- Just trying to give the
people a little bit of juice,


1052
00:46:39.092 --> 00:46:42.359
you know, not the
same old Q and A.

1053
00:46:42.359 --> 00:46:43.448
All right, cool.

1054
00:46:43.448 --> 00:46:46.916
All right, so, Zaytoven,
new tour making noise,


1055
00:46:46.916 --> 00:46:51.507
new music, artists like
Future, Gucci, Rihanna.


1056
00:46:51.507 --> 00:46:55.557
Would you consider yourself
a role model by any chance?


1057
00:46:55.557 --> 00:46:57.507
- I really leave that to
the people that really,


1058
00:46:57.507 --> 00:46:59.799
you know, that look at me
and judge my character.


1059
00:46:59.799 --> 00:47:04.799
I really just try to be me,
just try to be Zaytoven.


1060
00:47:04.839 --> 00:47:06.093
- Really, that's interesting, as well.

1061
00:47:06.093 --> 00:47:09.807
Because people like Ashley
Allen, Desmond McCraven,


1062
00:47:09.807 --> 00:47:12.706
Bobby Jackson, Demetrius
Taylor, were all murdered


1063
00:47:12.706 --> 00:47:15.392
by the hands of police
officers in this month alone.


1064
00:47:15.392 --> 00:47:18.500
What is your take on
it, how do you feel?

1065
00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:20.966
- Well, I really don't like
to give my personal opinion


1066
00:47:20.966 --> 00:47:24.773
to the media, you know, on
those type of situations


1067
00:47:24.773 --> 00:47:27.599
because a lot of time I get misquoted,

1068
00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:30.256
say things I didn't really say.

1069
00:47:30.256 --> 00:47:31.837
You know, I got my concerns about it,

1070
00:47:31.837 --> 00:47:34.139
it's just, I don't feel like, you know,

1071
00:47:34.139 --> 00:47:36.081
it's for everybody.

1072
00:47:36.081 --> 00:47:37.745
- People would say that
that was a safe way


1073
00:47:37.745 --> 00:47:41.787
to put it, don't you
think, like a cop out.


1074
00:47:41.787 --> 00:47:44.718
- No, I just feel like I don't
need to share that with you.


1075
00:47:44.718 --> 00:47:46.867
- No disrespect, Mr. Zaytoven.

1076
00:47:46.867 --> 00:47:50.129
- Guys, chill, let's reset,
reset, everybody good, chill.


1077
00:47:50.129 --> 00:47:52.628
- Listen, listen, listen.

1078
00:47:52.628 --> 00:47:56.046
What's messed up is your
guy here is asking a lot of


1079
00:47:56.046 --> 00:47:57.300
fucked up ass questions.

1080
00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:59.136
It's really starting to irritate me.

1081
00:47:59.136 --> 00:48:01.874
Come on, what we doing here?
- We ask the hard questions.


1082
00:48:01.874 --> 00:48:02.707
- Hard questions?

1083
00:48:02.707 --> 00:48:05.305
Come on, how you think
that made this man feel?


1084
00:48:05.305 --> 00:48:08.168
- It's cool, it's cool, it's cool.

1085
00:48:08.168 --> 00:48:10.264
You know what I don't like?

1086
00:48:10.264 --> 00:48:12.942
I don't like the fact
that the police officers


1087
00:48:12.942 --> 00:48:16.406
come in shooting up innocent
people in neighborhoods


1088
00:48:16.406 --> 00:48:18.488
that they don't stay
in, and then they don't


1089
00:48:18.488 --> 00:48:21.038
get arrested or nothing,
all they do is go on


1090
00:48:21.038 --> 00:48:23.984
administrative leave.
- People like you


1091
00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:25.865
say things like that all the time.

1092
00:48:25.865 --> 00:48:27.367
Yet you do for your neighborhoods

1093
00:48:27.367 --> 00:48:31.261
and then you create the
sound for this chaos.


1094
00:48:31.261 --> 00:48:34.960
- I don't promote violence,
no killing, no murdering,


1095
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.922
nothing stupid like that.

1096
00:48:36.922 --> 00:48:38.856
No black on black crime.

1097
00:48:38.856 --> 00:48:41.622
Matter of fact, Black
Lives Matter could be


1098
00:48:41.622 --> 00:48:43.112
something special if they
would come to the hood


1099
00:48:43.112 --> 00:48:47.029
and get it organized,
calm down the crime rate.


1100
00:48:48.754 --> 00:48:51.051
- So you're against Black Lives Matter?

1101
00:48:51.051 --> 00:48:54.213
- I'm just saying responsibilities.

1102
00:48:54.213 --> 00:48:56.627
You got to be responsible for yourself.

1103
00:48:56.627 --> 00:48:59.083
You got to be responsible
raising up your kids.


1104
00:48:59.083 --> 00:49:01.101
It's a lot of things I don't like.

1105
00:49:01.101 --> 00:49:03.513
Like, I don't like same sex marriage.

1106
00:49:03.513 --> 00:49:05.841
- Oh, really.
- I think that's wrong.


1107
00:49:05.841 --> 00:49:07.846
I think all that junk wrong, for real.

1108
00:49:07.846 --> 00:49:11.136
I'm really done with this interview.

1109
00:49:11.136 --> 00:49:12.794
- Let's get up out of here.

1110
00:49:14.442 --> 00:49:15.772
What in the world is this?

1111
00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:20.342
- Who are y'all?

1112
00:49:20.342 --> 00:49:22.684
- What's going on here?

1113
00:49:22.684 --> 00:49:23.517
- Sit your motherfucking ass down, boy.

1114
00:49:23.517 --> 00:49:25.935
You interviewing him, right?

1115
00:49:25.935 --> 00:49:27.928
- I mean, yes, sir, but I'm
not trying to die for it.


1116
00:49:27.928 --> 00:49:29.470
- Print this.

1117
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.744
Zaytoven had the Demarco B killed

1118
00:49:31.744 --> 00:49:34.242
because he didn't want to
pay him what he owed him.


1119
00:49:34.242 --> 00:49:36.255
- Zay, what the fuck are
you talking about, man?


1120
00:49:36.255 --> 00:49:38.255
Man, what the fuck, man?

1121
00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.633
- Hey, man, I don't
know who no Demarco is.


1122
00:49:42.633 --> 00:49:43.907
As a matter of fact, let's go, man,

1123
00:49:43.907 --> 00:49:45.319
it's time to get out of here.

1124
00:49:45.319 --> 00:49:47.174
- Black gangster.

1125
00:49:47.174 --> 00:49:49.225
That's why you had him killed.

1126
00:49:49.225 --> 00:49:51.367
Zaytoven is a murderer.

1127
00:49:51.367 --> 00:49:53.054
Y'all praising this fool?

1128
00:49:53.054 --> 00:49:55.391
He ain't no godly man.

1129
00:49:55.391 --> 00:49:58.130
- You don't know what
you're talking about, man.


1130
00:49:58.130 --> 00:50:00.044
- Black guy Gucci, man, they used beat.

1131
00:50:00.044 --> 00:50:03.634
You owe Black 50% of everything.

1132
00:50:03.634 --> 00:50:07.051
Now my sister, nigga, deserve that money.

1133
00:50:08.258 --> 00:50:12.348
That contract you signed,
right here in my possession.


1134
00:50:19.799 --> 00:50:21.217
- Wait a minute, so, you telling me,

1135
00:50:21.217 --> 00:50:25.239
now all this work I done over
these last couple of years,


1136
00:50:25.239 --> 00:50:27.493
that 50% of what I've been doing

1137
00:50:27.493 --> 00:50:30.076
should go to a dead nigga wife?

1138
00:50:31.218 --> 00:50:33.192
You got to be stupid.

1139
00:50:33.192 --> 00:50:34.025
- Stupid?

1140
00:50:35.906 --> 00:50:39.928
Nigga, that's some mean ass
cussing you land on right now.


1141
00:50:39.928 --> 00:50:42.308
See, I'm a street nigga.

1142
00:50:42.308 --> 00:50:43.391
Work some up.

1143
00:50:44.635 --> 00:50:47.363
I got the baddest attorney
in the motherfucking south.


1144
00:50:47.363 --> 00:50:49.215
Right now, it's all hearsay.

1145
00:50:49.215 --> 00:50:52.009
But when I get this little
motherfucker to preach this,


1146
00:50:52.009 --> 00:50:54.950
with all my social media
around to validate,


1147
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:57.098
motherfucker, I can destroy you.

1148
00:50:57.098 --> 00:51:00.450
You don't want the truth to come out.

1149
00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:01.704
Nigga, pay your money.

1150
00:51:10.978 --> 00:51:13.126
- How does it feel to be,
the other way around, huh?


1151
00:51:13.126 --> 00:51:15.293
Get your punk ass up, man.

1152
00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:18.810
- These your people?
- Shit.


1153
00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:22.051
Any other people, nigga, all
you had to do was sign me.


1154
00:51:22.051 --> 00:51:23.551
Shit, just so happened my uncle want

1155
00:51:23.551 --> 00:51:25.051
your puss ass too.

1156
00:51:26.229 --> 00:51:27.337
Shit.
- Nigga.


1157
00:51:27.337 --> 00:51:29.893
You thought you was gonna
run off in the sunset


1158
00:51:29.893 --> 00:51:31.976
with all that money, huh?

1159
00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:34.825
Nigga, you forgot one thing.

1160
00:51:34.825 --> 00:51:36.883
The streets keep the score.

1161
00:51:36.883 --> 00:51:39.119
They decide who wins.

1162
00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:43.080
- No, Dayton, come on,
man, don't hurt him, man.


1163
00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:44.663
- Be easy, be easy.

1164
00:51:47.718 --> 00:51:49.824
Look at me, look.

1165
00:51:49.824 --> 00:51:52.904
You should look, nigga.
- Man, come on, man,


1166
00:51:52.904 --> 00:51:53.821
chill, man.

1167
00:51:55.564 --> 00:51:58.994
This shit ain't got to go
down like this.


1168
00:52:01.157 --> 00:52:03.801
- As a matter of fact, fuck
all that, man. Hey, catch them.


1169
00:52:03.801 --> 00:52:05.138
This nigga no other chance.

1170
00:52:05.138 --> 00:52:07.117
Too many chances.

to the step unit here, OK?

All right, take care.

00:53:56.474 --> 00:53:57.807
- How bad is it?

1201
00:54:00.464 --> 00:54:02.047
- They did surgery.

1202
00:54:03.207 --> 00:54:07.957
Said something about some
crushed trapezoid or something.


1203

I may not play again, though.

Don't say that.

1206

- It don't matter how good
I try to live my life.


1207

It's like that black situation.

It's gonna keep haunting me.

1209
00:54:26.308 --> 00:54:28.688
We should have did that.

1218

1220
00:54:49.836 --> 00:54:51.162
- What you mean?

1221
00:54:51.162 --> 00:54:52.578
Why not?
- Listen, man.


1222
00:54:52.578 --> 00:54:53.990
It's over with.

1223
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:55.718
I'm retiring.

00:54:55.718 --> 00:54:56.551
I'm done.

1225
00:54:57.844 --> 00:55:00.097
I can't play no more.

1226
00:55:00.097 --> 00:55:01.797
- Here we go
with this shit again, man.

1227
00:55:01.797 --> 00:55:03.309
Come on, man.
- Do you hear


1228
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:04.785
what the press is saying?
- Yes.


1229
00:55:04.785 --> 00:55:05.618
And?

1230
00:55:07.173 --> 00:55:09.325
- They destroying my name.

1231
00:55:09.325 --> 00:55:11.951
They putting words in my mouth.

1232
00:55:11.951 --> 00:55:14.219
- Listen, man, we'll fix that.

1233
00:55:14.219 --> 00:55:18.150
We got the paper
to fix that shit, man.

1234
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.492
- It can't be fixed.
- Why not?


1235
00:55:20.492 --> 00:55:24.244
- Now once they find
out that I had something


1236
00:55:24.244 --> 00:55:25.650
to do with Black being killed,

1237
00:55:25.650 --> 00:55:29.290
me and you, sir, we gonna
have some real problems


1238
00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:30.373
on our hands.

1239
00:55:33.037 --> 00:55:34.701
- Listen, man.

1240
00:55:34.701 --> 00:55:36.618
We gonna fix that, cuz.

1241
00:55:38.052 --> 00:55:40.393
Nigga, we created a legacy.

1242
00:55:40.393 --> 00:55:42.363
And you talking about retire.

1243
00:55:42.363 --> 00:55:44.531
What's wrong with you, dog?

1244
00:55:44.531 --> 00:55:45.501
- No.

1245
00:55:45.501 --> 00:55:46.585
I created some beats.

1246
00:55:46.585 --> 00:55:48.835
I did never want no legacy.

1247
00:55:50.128 --> 00:55:52.378
That's all you cared about.

1248
00:55:56.961 --> 00:55:59.928
Ever since you done came in my life,

1249
00:55:59.928 --> 00:56:04.296
there ain't been nothing
but pain and destruction.


1250
00:56:04.296 --> 00:56:07.516
I almost wish you would have
never walked in the shop.


1251
00:56:07.516 --> 00:56:09.849
- Cuz, how can you say that?

1252
00:56:11.205 --> 00:56:13.038
I bought us a way out.

1253
00:56:14.259 --> 00:56:16.304
- OK, yeah, you did that.

1254
00:56:16.304 --> 00:56:18.142
But you got paid good, didn't you?

1255
00:56:18.142 --> 00:56:19.455
- Yeah.
- Now what did it


1256
00:56:19.455 --> 00:56:21.353
cost you, huh?

1257
00:56:21.353 --> 00:56:23.103
What did it cost you?

1258
00:56:25.502 --> 00:56:26.944
You know what, bro?

1259
00:56:26.944 --> 00:56:27.777
Get out.

1260
00:56:30.202 --> 00:56:32.238
- Listen, man.
- Out.


1261
00:56:32.238 --> 00:56:34.071
I need space, get out.

1262
00:56:34.974 --> 00:56:36.864
OK, I want to
spend time with my family,

1263
00:56:36.864 --> 00:56:41.723
tell the lawyers, tell the
labels, bag up for a second.


1264
00:56:41.723 --> 00:56:43.989
- Listen, man, wait, just--

1265
00:56:43.989 --> 00:56:45.405
- Bro, get out of here, man, go.

1266
00:56:45.405 --> 00:56:46.238
Get out.

1267
00:57:00.096 --> 00:57:02.704
- Trap music is crap music.

1268
00:57:02.704 --> 00:57:03.796
No Zaytoven.

1269
00:57:03.796 --> 00:57:05.091
No Zaytoven.

1270
00:57:06.982 --> 00:57:10.178
- Zaytoven, Zaytoven, Zaytoven.

1271
00:57:10.178 --> 00:57:15.178
- You guys, just please
calm down, please calm down.


1272
00:57:15.296 --> 00:57:16.856
- What happened to your hand?

1273
00:57:16.856 --> 00:57:19.098
They didn't take no jury?

1274
00:57:19.098 --> 00:57:21.503
- If everybody would calm
down, I have something


1275
00:57:21.503 --> 00:57:22.670
I want to say.

1276
00:57:25.183 --> 00:57:28.340
First of all, let me say
that I am very humbled


1277
00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:31.386
by everybody that's been praying for me

1278
00:57:31.386 --> 00:57:34.803
and supporting me in my time of recovery.

1279
00:57:38.552 --> 00:57:41.302
I have decided to spend more time

1280
00:57:42.341 --> 00:57:46.008
with my family, my
friends, and really enjoy


1281
00:57:48.968 --> 00:57:51.551
the life that God has given me.

1282
00:57:52.875 --> 00:57:54.875
So with that being said,

1283
00:57:56.901 --> 00:58:01.234
I have decided to step down
from the music industry.


1284
00:58:05.576 --> 00:58:07.266
- Zaytoven, Zaytoven.

1285
00:58:07.266 --> 00:58:11.090
Can you please address the
pending lawsuit against you?


1286
00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:14.624
- As far as
the pending lawsuit between me

1287
00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:18.541
and Trisha Peters, we
did come to a settlement.


1288
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:23.007
And as far as
anybody saying that I had

1289
00:58:23.007 --> 00:58:26.951
something to do with
somebody being killed,


1290
00:58:26.951 --> 00:58:30.925
those rumors are false, and
I won't mention that again.


1291
00:58:30.925 --> 00:58:33.842
- What really happened in New York?

1292
00:58:35.968 --> 00:58:37.486
- Excuse me, excuse me.

1293
00:58:37.486 --> 00:58:39.486
Zay, you are a murderer.

1294
00:58:40.844 --> 00:58:42.554
You are guilty and you know it.

1295
00:58:42.554 --> 00:58:44.674
- Ma'am--
- Get off of me.


1296
00:58:44.674 --> 00:58:45.722
- Ma'am.
- Let me go.


1297
00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:47.456
You committed a murder.

1298
00:58:47.456 --> 00:58:49.907
- Thank you guys for coming out.

1299
00:58:49.907 --> 00:58:51.956
- You need to speak the truth,

1300
00:58:51.956 --> 00:58:53.580
speak the truth right now, Zay.

1301
00:59:01.175 --> 00:59:04.258
- Saint John 10 and 10, Jesus stated,

1302
00:59:05.249 --> 00:59:08.010
"I am come that you might have life.

1303
00:59:08.010 --> 00:59:10.677
"And have life more abundantly."

1304
00:59:11.661 --> 00:59:15.078
And you know, God orchestrates our lives.

1305
00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:21.219
In such a unique way that
we're designed by God


1306
00:59:21.219 --> 00:59:23.720
for his purpose and for his plan.

1307
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:27.174
God so orchestrated our lives
and God has fulfilled a plan


1308
00:59:27.174 --> 00:59:31.354
for every believer to come in and believe

1309
00:59:31.354 --> 00:59:34.977
what his words say and obey his voice.

1310
00:59:34.977 --> 00:59:35.810
Say amen.

1311
00:59:36.965 --> 00:59:40.726
Jesus was stating in
Saint John 10 and 10,

1312
00:59:40.726 --> 00:59:44.673
he revealed God's
overall plan for mankind.


1313
00:59:44.673 --> 00:59:47.340
And we would just obey his voice

1314
00:59:48.339 --> 00:59:52.499
and hear his word and
be obedient to his word.


1315
00:59:52.499 --> 00:59:54.301
God can do things in our lives.

1316
00:59:54.301 --> 00:59:55.762
Can we say hallelujah.

1317
00:59:55.762 --> 00:59:59.642
God's plan for mankind is that we live

1318
00:59:59.642 --> 01:00:02.098
according to his word.

1319
01:00:02.098 --> 01:00:05.261
That we live, amen, in
almighty God's presence.


1320
01:00:05.261 --> 01:00:07.910
That we show the
world what type of life

1321
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:09.422
we're supposed to be living.

1322
01:00:09.422 --> 01:00:10.672
Say hallelujah.

1323
01:00:11.591 --> 01:00:14.801
We know the devil comes to
kill, steal, and destroy.


1324
01:00:14.801 --> 01:00:17.987
But God's word has set us right, amen.

1325
01:00:17.987 --> 01:00:21.387
If God can be for me,
who can be against me?


1326
01:00:21.387 --> 01:00:25.175
Jesus want us to
know that the wicked one,

1327
01:00:25.175 --> 01:00:27.303
the wickedness or the evil,
that's in this present world,


1328
01:00:27.303 --> 01:00:29.470
is called the thief, amen.

1329
01:00:30.966 --> 01:00:32.716
Say hallelujah, amen.

1330
01:00:33.816 --> 01:00:35.700
Pray women say hallelujah.

1331
01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:38.133
Jesus personified that the wickedness

1332
01:00:38.133 --> 01:00:43.133
and the evil forces, amen,
are being called a thief.


1333
01:00:43.216 --> 01:00:44.633
Calling us to be.

1334
01:00:45.766 --> 01:00:47.655
Say hallelujah.

1335
01:00:47.655 --> 01:00:48.488
Now look.

1336
01:00:50.055 --> 01:00:54.207
On the six o'clock news, I see
the thief robbing us, amen.


1337
01:00:54.207 --> 01:00:56.326
When I see our brothers and sisters

1338
01:00:56.326 --> 01:00:57.935
killing one another,

1339
01:00:57.935 --> 01:01:01.037
I see the thief is robbing us, hallelujah.

1340
01:01:01.037 --> 01:01:03.035
Can we say hallelujah?

1341
01:01:03.035 --> 01:01:06.117
But if the thief comes, he's trouble.

1342
01:01:06.117 --> 01:01:09.578
If the thief comes, he
recognize that he can overtake


1343
01:01:09.578 --> 01:01:11.064
some of us, amen.

1344
01:01:11.064 --> 01:01:14.936
But God bless him,
restores us, hallelujah.


1345
01:01:14.936 --> 01:01:18.079
God bless him, bring us back
to where we're supposed to be.


1346
01:01:18.079 --> 01:01:20.770
If I could only believe,
if I could only believe


1347
01:01:20.770 --> 01:01:22.634
that God is on my side.

1348
01:01:22.634 --> 01:01:24.612
If I could only believe, amen,

1349
01:01:24.612 --> 01:01:28.343
that God is working it
out for me, for you, amen,


1350
01:01:28.343 --> 01:01:31.399
I would orchestrate
something in your life.


1351
01:01:31.399 --> 01:01:34.391
To change your whole perimeter, amen.

1352
01:01:34.391 --> 01:01:37.339
To change your whole way
of thinking, hallelujah.


1353
01:01:37.339 --> 01:01:38.991
To give you a new life.

1354
01:01:38.991 --> 01:01:40.473
To give you a better life.

1355
01:01:41.851 --> 01:01:43.104
Hallelujah.

1356
01:01:43.104 --> 01:01:44.716
Somebody ought to say amen.

1357
01:01:44.716 --> 01:01:47.048
Somebody ought to stand
up and give him praise.


1358
01:01:47.048 --> 01:01:48.540
Say hallelujah.

1359
01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.040
Oh my God, my God.

1360
01:01:51.548 --> 01:01:53.080
Jesus, hallelujah.

1361
01:01:58.302 --> 01:01:59.385
Church, amen.

1362
01:02:00.236 --> 01:02:02.051
Church, amen.

1363
01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:03.134
Church, amen.

1364
01:02:04.669 --> 01:02:07.054
It'll be all right, amen.

1365
01:02:07.054 --> 01:02:08.971
Just trust in the lord.

1366
01:02:11.673 --> 01:02:14.923
- Starting with, starting with, apples.

1367
01:02:17.728 --> 01:02:19.500
- Blueberries.

1368
01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:20.833
- Kiwi.
- Apples.


1369
01:02:22.918 --> 01:02:24.446
- Strawberries.

1370
01:02:24.446 --> 01:02:26.092
Come on, babe, come
downstairs, come join the fun.


1371
01:02:26.092 --> 01:02:27.420
- Come on, Daddy.
- Come on.


1372
01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:31.158
- Come on, Daddy.
- Come on, come join the fun.


1373
01:02:31.158 --> 01:02:33.766
- Nah, y'all go ahead.

1374
01:02:33.766 --> 01:02:34.599
- Really?

1375
01:02:38.923 --> 01:02:39.840
Pineapples.

1376
01:02:41.383 --> 01:02:43.089
- Yo, what's going on, everybody?

1377
01:02:43.089 --> 01:02:45.219
This your girl Kay with
No Days Off Live TV.


1378
01:02:45.219 --> 01:02:46.635
And you are sitting here with me today,

1379
01:02:46.635 --> 01:02:49.302
with Little Ryan, 
ACL's, almost.

1380
01:02:52.799 --> 01:02:53.632
I'm sorry.

1381
01:02:54.757 --> 01:02:55.924
Oh, I'm sorry.

1382
01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:58.912
Doesn't no longer go by Little Ryan,

1383
01:02:58.912 --> 01:03:00.350
since his major success.

1384
01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:01.566
Let's talk about that.

1385
01:03:01.566 --> 01:03:03.298
How has life been treating
you ever since your


1386
01:03:03.298 --> 01:03:04.994
recent success as a producer?

1387
01:03:04.994 --> 01:03:06.885
It just happened so fast, like.

1388
01:03:06.885 --> 01:03:11.125
Do you have anybody
that you look up to or?


1389
01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:34.957
Well, speaking of Zaytoven,
I heard about his recent


1390
01:03:34.957 --> 01:03:38.134
situation with the physical altercation

1391
01:03:38.134 --> 01:03:40.024
that he was involved in.

1392
01:03:40.024 --> 01:03:42.404
It's looking like he's
not gonna be able to play,


1393
01:03:42.404 --> 01:03:44.134
you know, for a long time.

1394
01:03:44.134 --> 01:03:47.239
How do you feel about
that, being that it was--


1395
01:03:47.239 --> 01:03:50.485
- Hey, babe, what you watching?

1396
01:03:50.485 --> 01:03:52.455
- Gonna be out the game now.
- Nothing.


1397
01:03:52.455 --> 01:03:54.270
- Is that that guy?

1398
01:03:54.270 --> 01:03:57.975
Is that the bloody that
was saying all that stuff?


1399
01:03:57.975 --> 01:04:00.054
Is that the guy?

1400
01:04:00.054 --> 01:04:02.221
- Zaytoven.
- Free bird got


1401
01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:06.238
the crazy shit coming.

1402
01:04:08.664 --> 01:04:11.597
- Did you even try to play today?

1403
01:04:11.597 --> 01:04:14.582
- I might not ever play again.
- Why would you say


1404
01:04:14.582 --> 01:04:16.348
something like that?

1405
01:04:16.348 --> 01:04:17.968
Like you know this is only temporary.

1406
01:04:17.968 --> 01:04:20.908
You know this is not your end.

1407
01:04:20.908 --> 01:04:24.427
- Stacy, Stacy, not right
now, can you just back up


1408
01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:25.677
right now?
- No.


1409
01:04:27.605 --> 01:04:30.583
I sat and watched you do
that bogus press conference


1410
01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:33.318
without even consulting with me.

1411
01:04:33.318 --> 01:04:35.967
- Consulting with you?
- Yeah.


1412
01:04:35.967 --> 01:04:38.633
- Consulting you about what?

1413
01:04:38.633 --> 01:04:40.758
You see what they done to me?

1414
01:04:40.758 --> 01:04:42.862
Mess my hands all up.

1415
01:04:42.862 --> 01:04:44.676
That's what I got to deal with.

1416
01:04:44.676 --> 01:04:46.464
Like this my reality.

1417
01:04:46.464 --> 01:04:51.464
- You lying down to a bunch
of thugs is not your reality.


1418
01:04:51.568 --> 01:04:52.401
It's not.

1419
01:04:54.549 --> 01:04:57.925
- You don't even know
what you're talking about.


1420
01:04:57.925 --> 01:05:00.592
There are things that been done.

1421
01:05:01.881 --> 01:05:04.569
You ain't gonna never know.

1422
01:05:04.569 --> 01:05:05.861
- You know what?

1423
01:05:05.861 --> 01:05:07.267
I don't want to know.

1424
01:05:07.267 --> 01:05:09.922
But what I do know is
that I believe in God,


1425
01:05:09.922 --> 01:05:12.487
and you believe in God,

1426
01:05:12.487 --> 01:05:15.404
and the God that we serve forgives.

1427
01:05:16.824 --> 01:05:18.074
And we gonna be all right.

1428
01:05:18.074 --> 01:05:20.276
We gonna get through this.

1429
01:05:20.276 --> 01:05:23.255
We gonna get through this, babe.

1430
01:05:23.255 --> 01:05:25.542
- I'm just saying, I just
need you to lay off, though.


1431
01:05:25.542 --> 01:05:28.209
Lay off for a while, be patient.

1432
01:05:29.638 --> 01:05:32.055
- I'm being very patient, OK?

1433
01:05:33.543 --> 01:05:35.227
But I'll do that.

1434
01:05:35.227 --> 01:05:38.319
I'll lay off of you, but
what I need you to do


1435
01:05:38.319 --> 01:05:40.371
is to lay off those meds.

1436
01:05:40.371 --> 01:05:41.695
I'm being very patient.

1437
01:05:41.695 --> 01:05:43.983
- I don't know what you're talking about.

1438
01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:44.989
- You know what?

1439
01:05:44.989 --> 01:05:46.955
You're running off your fans.

1440
01:05:46.955 --> 01:05:50.038
Don't run off the ones that love you.

1441
01:05:58.182 --> 01:05:59.515
- What's up cuz?

1442
01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:03.090
- You wanted to see me, right?

1443
01:06:06.346 --> 01:06:08.975
You wanted to see me, right?

1444
01:06:08.975 --> 01:06:10.507
Well here I am.

1445
01:06:16.757 --> 01:06:17.674
- Hold him.

1446
01:06:18.611 --> 01:06:21.343
What's this little nigga think he doing?

1447
01:06:21.343 --> 01:06:25.080
- Little nigga must have grew some nuts.

1448
01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.190
- I don't even know who you is.

1449
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:30.590
I don't owe you nothing.

1450
01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:32.786
- See you owe a lot.

1451
01:06:32.786 --> 01:06:35.203
You owe my baby sister a lot.

1452
01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:40.299
You don't like to share, I see.

1453
01:06:40.299 --> 01:06:41.216
- For what?

1454
01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:43.373
Share for what?

1455
01:06:44.737 --> 01:06:47.593
I worked too hard
to get where I'm at.

1456
01:06:47.593 --> 01:06:51.010
So you won't never know nothing about it.

1457
01:06:52.415 --> 01:06:54.347
- You ain't do shit.

1458
01:06:54.347 --> 01:06:57.241
What you did was get my husband killed.

1459
01:06:57.241 --> 01:06:59.744
All 'cause he wanted his money.

1460
01:06:59.744 --> 01:07:01.550
You ain't a honey.

1461
01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.340
That ain't a honey.

1462
01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.064
I don't even see how
everybody walking around


1463
01:07:05.064 --> 01:07:07.548
praising your weak ass.

1464
01:07:07.548 --> 01:07:08.715
- Praising me?

1465
01:07:09.798 --> 01:07:12.548
I ain't never want to be praised.

1466
01:07:13.801 --> 01:07:15.968
I just wanted to do music.

1467
01:07:17.118 --> 01:07:19.861
- Now what you gonna do with that?

1468
01:07:19.861 --> 01:07:22.929
- You a church boy, little nigga.

1469
01:07:22.929 --> 01:07:24.659
- What you gonna do?

1470
01:07:24.659 --> 01:07:27.025
You gonna kill us like
you killed my husband?


1471
01:07:27.025 --> 01:07:28.671
You ain't nothing but a murderer.

1472
01:07:28.671 --> 01:07:29.504
- Shut up.

1473
01:07:30.475 --> 01:07:31.308
Shut up.

1474
01:07:33.899 --> 01:07:36.714
- The big bad golly producer walks into

1475
01:07:36.714 --> 01:07:40.049
a boxing gym and murders three people.

1476
01:07:40.049 --> 01:07:43.049
Witnesses say he got a long history.

1477
01:07:46.452 --> 01:07:48.343
- You ain't tough, Zaytoven.

1478
01:07:48.343 --> 01:07:49.510
Put that gun down.

1479
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:50.850
- Shut up.
- Run me


1480
01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:52.663
my motherfucking money.

1481
01:07:52.663 --> 01:07:53.863
- Y'all the devil.

1482
01:07:53.863 --> 01:07:55.543
This shit is.

1483
01:07:55.543 --> 01:07:56.960
Y'all are devils.

1484
01:07:57.873 --> 01:08:00.365
- We ain't the devil, nigga.

1485
01:08:00.365 --> 01:08:01.282
We reality.

1486
01:08:03.783 --> 01:08:07.033
Now do what you gonna do, little bitch.

1487
01:08:08.255 --> 01:08:09.738
- Shoot.

1488
01:08:26.513 --> 01:08:28.733
- 13 ball corner pocket.

1489
01:08:28.733 --> 01:08:30.257
- Man, that ain't shit, man.

1490
01:08:30.257 --> 01:08:32.513
Get your ears out of the street, homey.

1491
01:08:32.513 --> 01:08:34.763
- Forget it, make that 200.

1492
01:08:40.211 --> 01:08:41.824
- Hey, baby, how you doing?

1493
01:08:41.824 --> 01:08:44.357
Would you like a drink?

1494
01:08:44.357 --> 01:08:48.607
- Give me a Don Julio,
double, put some salt on it.


1495
01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.126
- Be right back.

1496
01:08:55.466 --> 01:08:57.266
- Yo, what's up, new?

1497
01:08:57.266 --> 01:09:00.716
You got nicked, because if
you do, three out of the ball


1498
01:09:00.716 --> 01:09:02.133
for you, partner.

1499
01:09:03.455 --> 01:09:05.827
- You know I ain't come in
for no damn pool, Johnny.


1500
01:09:05.827 --> 01:09:07.071
- Well what you come here for?

1501
01:09:07.071 --> 01:09:08.551
You in a pool hall.

1502
01:09:08.551 --> 01:09:10.203
What you think we do up here?

1503
01:09:10.203 --> 01:09:11.769
You know you scratched up that bar, too.

1504
01:09:11.769 --> 01:09:12.602
My shot.

1505
01:09:14.265 --> 01:09:15.237
- Cut the bullshit, man.

1506
01:09:15.237 --> 01:09:17.243
You talked to him yet, or what?

1507
01:09:17.243 --> 01:09:18.485
- Look, man.

1508
01:09:18.485 --> 01:09:20.706
I ain't talked to Zay in three weeks.

1509
01:09:20.706 --> 01:09:22.412
I don't know what's going on.

1510
01:09:22.412 --> 01:09:24.822
Y'all killing me with this shit, man.

1511
01:09:24.822 --> 01:09:28.084
And on top of that, we done
lost all our endorsements.


1512
01:09:28.084 --> 01:09:30.330
We lost all sponsorships.

1513
01:09:30.330 --> 01:09:35.176
Everything, I mean, shit
fucked up right now, man.


1514
01:09:35.176 --> 01:09:36.631
- Don't worry about it.

1515
01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:38.079
He just want to
be out for a second.

1516
01:09:38.079 --> 01:09:39.443
- Out?

1517
01:09:39.443 --> 01:09:41.135
- Yeah, be out.
- What you mean by,


1518
01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:43.035
like, what's that supposed to be?

1519
01:09:43.035 --> 01:09:44.643
Because what do that mean for me?

1520
01:09:44.643 --> 01:09:47.783
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

1521
01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:50.715
- That means he just want
to be out for a second.


1522
01:09:50.715 --> 01:09:51.845
Just chill the fuck out.

1523
01:09:51.845 --> 01:09:53.625
- Look, man, I'm a business man.

1524
01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:56.634
I ain't signed up
for this type of shit.

1525
01:09:56.634 --> 01:09:58.712
All these shoot out beefs.

1526
01:09:58.712 --> 01:09:59.545
Polices.

1527
01:10:00.678 --> 01:10:02.750
I'm a manager, man, that's
what I do, I manage.


1528
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:05.280
- Listen, this was way before you, Johnny,

1529
01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.374
just chill out, you don't
know what's going on.


1530
01:10:07.374 --> 01:10:09.218
- Like, what really happened?

1531
01:10:09.218 --> 01:10:12.473
Because word on the street, it's true.

1532
01:10:12.473 --> 01:10:15.211
- Shit, it's all over,
that's the talk of the town.


1533
01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:16.577
- That's all rumors.

1534
01:10:16.577 --> 01:10:17.671
- I don't know what you think,

1535
01:10:17.671 --> 01:10:20.823
I mean, you think I'm green
or something, apparently.


1536
01:10:20.823 --> 01:10:22.667
Why you trying me like that,
what's really going on, man?


1537
01:10:22.667 --> 01:10:24.667
- It's your shot, homie.

1538
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:29.440
- Know what, man?

1539
01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:33.458
Shit can hit the fan, but I
ain't gonna let it hit me.


1540
01:10:33.458 --> 01:10:35.510
Like I don't know
what y'all got going on,

1541
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:39.014
but y'all boys got
yourselves into some shit


1542
01:10:39.014 --> 01:10:40.960
y'all can't get out of.

1543
01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:43.946
That's what it seems like to me.

1544
01:10:43.946 --> 01:10:45.958
- Johnny, you know how long
we been out here, nigga?


1545
01:10:45.958 --> 01:10:49.208
Face car A1 bro, what's wrong with you?

1546
01:10:51.465 --> 01:10:53.475
That shit was random, nigga.

1547
01:10:53.475 --> 01:10:55.475
- Random, for real, wow.

1548
01:10:56.447 --> 01:10:59.530
Where they do that at?
- Shit happens.


1549
01:11:01.277 --> 01:11:04.247
- Always happen when you around, though.

1550
01:11:04.247 --> 01:11:06.100
- Listen, man.

1551
01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:07.544
At the end of the day, my nigga,

1552
01:11:07.544 --> 01:11:09.914
I just need you and Adam to play

1553
01:11:09.914 --> 01:11:11.360
your motherfucking position.

1554
01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:13.368
See what I'm saying, because
y'all in it for a reason.


1555
01:11:13.368 --> 01:11:14.972
All right, don't start bitching up

1556
01:11:14.972 --> 01:11:16.984
just because shit hit the fan, Johnny.

1557
01:11:16.984 --> 01:11:19.390
- Look, man, it's funny how the villain

1558
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:22.063
always plays the victim.

1559
01:11:22.063 --> 01:11:23.767
I mean, you know what, Al?

1560
01:11:23.767 --> 01:11:26.463
You really fucked that boy's career up.

1561
01:11:26.463 --> 01:11:27.585
- Fuck his career up?

1562
01:11:27.585 --> 01:11:29.273
Nigga, I gave Zaytoven a career.

1563
01:11:29.273 --> 01:11:31.159
Fuck you, Johnny.

1564
01:11:31.159 --> 01:11:33.287
- No you didn't.

1565
01:11:33.287 --> 01:11:34.704
The dead man did.

1566
01:11:36.175 --> 01:11:37.975
I quit, too, by the way.

1567
01:11:37.975 --> 01:11:41.256
Shit, man, fuck all this shit.

1568
01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:42.564
Fuck.

1569
01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:55.676
- My, you're still here?

1570
01:11:58.275 --> 01:12:01.093
I been here since seven AM.

1571
01:12:01.093 --> 01:12:02.593
I am clocking out.

1572
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:07.840
Anything I can get for you?

1573
01:12:08.719 --> 01:12:11.302
- No, I'm all right, thank you.

1574
01:12:16.494 --> 01:12:20.244
- You know, your uncle
opened his eyes today.


1575
01:12:23.898 --> 01:12:26.412
You know, it's not none of my business,

1576
01:12:26.412 --> 01:12:28.912
but God heals us when we pray.

1577
01:12:30.236 --> 01:12:33.455
And if you believe that, you don't worry

1578
01:12:33.455 --> 01:12:36.455
about them prayers getting answered.

1579
01:12:40.955 --> 01:12:42.475
I ain't talking about the prayers

1580
01:12:42.475 --> 01:12:45.308
you sent up to God for your uncle.

1581
01:12:50.164 --> 01:12:54.247
God gave you magnificent
hands, talented fingers.


1582
01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.691
He would never forsake you.

1583
01:12:57.691 --> 01:12:59.608
You gotta believe that.

1584
01:13:03.561 --> 01:13:06.331
But then again, it ain't
none of my business.


1585
01:13:06.331 --> 01:13:09.169
I'm just a little old nurse.

1586
01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:10.086
Good night.

1587
01:13:24.142 --> 01:13:24.975
- Well.

1588
01:13:26.722 --> 01:13:29.722
I ain't never felt like this before.

1589
01:13:34.631 --> 01:13:38.131
It's like, I don't
even know what to feel.

1590
01:13:39.052 --> 01:13:40.302
Or how to feel.

1591
01:13:46.711 --> 01:13:50.294
Why would you do this
to me all over again?


1592
01:13:52.111 --> 01:13:54.111
My faith is my strength.

1593
01:13:59.589 --> 01:14:02.089
At the same time, my weakness.

1594
01:14:07.774 --> 01:14:10.524
I used to love music, to love it.

1595
01:14:15.570 --> 01:14:17.153
Now I just hate it.

1596
01:14:20.331 --> 01:14:22.466
Nurse, nurse, come in, nurse.

1597
01:14:22.466 --> 01:14:24.393
- Never stop.
- Never stop what?


1598
01:14:24.393 --> 01:14:26.761
Calm down, just relax.
- Your gift.


1599
01:14:26.761 --> 01:14:29.535
It's bigger than you.
- Nurse, nurse.


1600
01:14:29.535 --> 01:14:32.628
- God's gift.
- What happened?


1601
01:14:32.628 --> 01:14:34.275
- Nurse, nurse, come here,
I don't know what's going on


1602
01:14:34.275 --> 01:14:35.489
with him.
- Calm down.


1603
01:14:42.636 --> 01:14:45.863
- No, I still want you to come.

1604
01:14:45.863 --> 01:14:48.113
Shit, meet me at Blue Room.

1605
01:14:49.127 --> 01:14:50.794
Pull up at the club.

1606
01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:53.357
For real.

1607
01:14:53.357 --> 01:14:54.809
I got you.

1608
01:14:54.809 --> 01:14:55.642
All right.

1609
01:14:56.501 --> 01:14:58.517
I only gonna be
here about 10 minute, man,

1610
01:14:58.517 --> 01:15:00.577
just hold on for
one second, I got you.

1611
01:15:00.577 --> 01:15:01.410
Yeah.

1612
01:15:02.338 --> 01:15:04.345
Bro, I told him, I'm only
gonna be here 10 minutes,


1613
01:15:04.345 --> 01:15:07.757
I got you, let
me call you right back.

1614
01:15:07.757 --> 01:15:10.639
Come on, bro, I told you, I'm
waiting for my people, man.


1615
01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:11.842
- It's not even me.

1616
01:15:11.842 --> 01:15:12.759
- I got 10.

1617
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:15.830
Always on that bullshit.

1618
01:15:16.922 --> 01:15:18.172
Here take this.

1619
01:15:19.346 --> 01:15:20.263
10 minutes.

1620
01:15:26.369 --> 01:15:28.119
Let me call you back.

1621
01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:33.845
- What's up, man?
- What up though?


1622
01:15:33.845 --> 01:15:35.735
- What's happening?

1623
01:15:35.735 --> 01:15:37.583
Shit, what's the name on the town, huh?

1624
01:15:37.583 --> 01:15:39.591
- Yeah, with little girls and shit.

1625
01:15:39.591 --> 01:15:40.773
- True.

1626
01:15:40.773 --> 01:15:41.773
You got right then.

1627
01:15:45.032 --> 01:15:47.538
- He good, he good, what's happening?

1628
01:15:47.538 --> 01:15:49.102
- What up there bro?

1629
01:15:49.102 --> 01:15:50.852
What you doing here, friend?

1630
01:15:56.358 --> 01:15:58.608
- This a five piece, right?

1631
01:15:59.614 --> 01:16:00.947
- I got it, fam.

1632
01:16:01.904 --> 01:16:02.908
- What's the ticket, bro?

1633
01:16:02.908 --> 01:16:05.010
- Shit, 15 five.
- 15 five.


1634
01:16:05.010 --> 01:16:06.819
- Yeah, nigga, same one bro.
- I thought it would


1635
01:16:06.819 --> 01:16:09.195
be a little cheaper than that.
- Man, you always was,


1636
01:16:09.195 --> 01:16:10.362
hey, hey, cuz.

1637
01:16:15.199 --> 01:16:16.116
- Let's go.

1638
01:16:39.987 --> 01:16:41.031
- Drop the gun.

1639
01:16:41.031 --> 01:16:43.185
- Drop the fucking guns.

1640
01:16:52.048 --> 01:16:53.210
- Man, God damn it, man.

1641
01:16:53.210 --> 01:16:55.627
Y'all always fucking shit up.

1642
01:17:05.952 --> 01:17:08.869
- And that's when it all fell down.

1643
01:17:10.007 --> 01:17:12.840
I never trusted his cousin anyway.

1644
01:17:14.887 --> 01:17:18.213
What I didn't know was,
police been watching me, Zay,


1645
01:17:18.213 --> 01:17:20.890
and every rapper you can think of.

1646
01:17:30.859 --> 01:17:33.517
Hey, man, rap police is
real, and they realer


1647
01:17:33.517 --> 01:17:34.684
than the feds.

1648
01:17:36.699 --> 01:17:38.829
They questioned me about Black murder

1649
01:17:38.829 --> 01:17:40.837
and everything that happened back then.

1650
01:17:40.837 --> 01:17:43.424
They even picked up Zay.

1651
01:17:43.424 --> 01:17:47.514
One of Black people was
a confidential informant.


1652
01:17:47.514 --> 01:17:51.422
They implemented Zay in Black murder.

1653
01:17:51.422 --> 01:17:54.648
They was really trying
to take the homie down.


1654
01:17:54.648 --> 01:17:56.065
Zay stood strong.

1655
01:18:03.715 --> 01:18:06.715
And I took the rap for Black murder.

1656
01:18:09.447 --> 01:18:12.030
Pleaded guilty in self defense.

1657
01:18:16.572 --> 01:18:17.739
Big, bad Rock.

1658
01:18:19.396 --> 01:18:20.646
Played himself.

1659
01:18:22.628 --> 01:18:24.796
But he got played his wife,
when she snitched on him


1660
01:18:24.796 --> 01:18:28.744
and ran off with his
fighter in the process.


1661
01:18:28.744 --> 01:18:31.873
Not only was Rock wanted by the feds,

1662
01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:36.457
but he was caught dirty
on top of attempted murder


1663
01:18:36.457 --> 01:18:38.290
and extortion charges.

1664
01:18:40.074 --> 01:18:43.241
They even snatched up his sister, too.

1665
01:18:54.895 --> 01:18:55.895
Dirty bitch.

1666
01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:11.298
- Come on, praise the Lord, everybody.

1667
01:19:11.298 --> 01:19:12.794
Come on, come on, praise
the Lord, come on,


1668
01:19:12.794 --> 01:19:15.654
this is the place where
we prove our faith.


1669
01:19:15.654 --> 01:19:17.441
Glory be to God.

1670
01:19:17.441 --> 01:19:19.207
It's hard to do this,
it's hard to say goodbye


1671
01:19:19.207 --> 01:19:20.624
to Pastor Brooks.

1672
01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:24.775
And he was like a father to me

1673
01:19:24.775 --> 01:19:28.363
and he introduced me to this church.

1674
01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:29.931
But he said, "Don't worry."

1675
01:19:29.931 --> 01:19:32.014
He said, "God in Christ."

1676
01:19:33.991 --> 01:19:35.842
And we all know that the Bible says

1677
01:19:35.842 --> 01:19:38.698
to be absent from the
body is to be present


1678
01:19:38.698 --> 01:19:39.865
with the Lord.

1679
01:19:43.606 --> 01:19:45.776
Today we done have Pastor Wells to come

1680
01:19:45.776 --> 01:19:48.776
and break with us the bread of life.

1681
01:19:49.776 --> 01:19:51.899
So come on and receive him by
putting your hands together.


1682
01:19:59.949 --> 01:20:03.423
- Giving God the praise,
giving God the honor.


1683
01:20:03.423 --> 01:20:05.340
Certainly a solemn day.

1684
01:20:06.973 --> 01:20:10.634
A day that we never thought would come.

1685
01:20:10.634 --> 01:20:13.884
To celebrate our pastor untimely death.

1686
01:20:16.180 --> 01:20:20.847
And even in his death, we
have confidence in God's word.


1687
01:20:21.925 --> 01:20:24.427
In the book of John, the

1688
01:20:24.427 --> 01:20:27.174
"Let not your heart be troubled."

1689
01:20:27.174 --> 01:20:30.835
Family come today, 
I'll just remind you

1690
01:20:30.835 --> 01:20:35.306
that even in times like this,
we don't have to be troubled.


1691
01:20:35.306 --> 01:20:37.649
Can I remind you of something?

1692
01:20:37.649 --> 01:20:40.827
Pastor Brooks is already
going to be with the Lord.


1693
01:20:40.827 --> 01:20:43.479
I didn't come to eulogize his funeral,

1694
01:20:43.479 --> 01:20:46.530
but I come to talk to
each and every one of us,


1695
01:20:46.530 --> 01:20:48.532
that we only have
a flicker of a time

1696
01:20:48.532 --> 01:20:50.622
while we here on this Earth.

1697
01:20:50.622 --> 01:20:53.674
And it's time for us to
get our life together.


1698
01:20:53.674 --> 01:20:55.922
The Bible teaches us,
amen, not to be troubled


1699
01:20:55.922 --> 01:20:57.505
in times like this.

1700
01:20:58.967 --> 01:21:01.924
Not only must we love like
God, but we also need to


1701
01:21:01.924 --> 01:21:03.871
trust like God.

1702
01:21:03.871 --> 01:21:07.175
The Bible says trust in the
Lord, even in times like this.


1703
01:21:07.175 --> 01:21:09.797
Jesus says, "Peace I leave with you."

1704
01:21:09.797 --> 01:21:11.967
He says, "My peace, not
the peace in the world


1705
01:21:11.967 --> 01:21:13.461
"give thee I give unto thee."

1706
01:21:13.461 --> 01:21:16.289
He says, "Not let your heart be troubled."

1707
01:21:16.289 --> 01:21:19.732
To this family, this ain't
the time to be troubled.


1708
01:21:19.732 --> 01:21:21.980
This is the time to trust God.

1709
01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:24.744
This is the time
to know that God is.

1710
01:21:24.744 --> 01:21:26.672
He is Jehovah.

1711
01:21:26.672 --> 01:21:28.406
He is our provider.

1712
01:21:28.406 --> 01:21:29.492
He is our healer.

1713
01:21:29.492 --> 01:21:31.020
He is our win maker.

1714
01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:33.396
He is everything that we need.

1715
01:21:33.396 --> 01:21:36.214
As a matter of fact, can
I bring my sister Misty.


1716
01:21:36.214 --> 01:21:38.223
Misty, can you come
and give us a word?

1717
01:21:38.223 --> 01:21:39.973
Amen, a song tonight.

1718
01:21:41.335 --> 01:21:42.779
Sing a song, baby.

1719
01:21:49.195 --> 01:21:51.607
♪ God ♪

1720
01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:55.843
♪ Is able to do ♪

1721
01:21:55.843 --> 01:21:59.715
