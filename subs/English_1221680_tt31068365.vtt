1
00:00:11.757 --> 00:00:12.757
Whoa.

2
00:00:15.674 --> 00:00:17.049
Elinor.

3
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:18.508
I'm here, Father.

4
00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:22.299
My eldest daughter,
I'm so proud of the woman


5
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:25.799
that you've come to be.

6
00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.299
Now, if my sickness continues,
your mother and sisters


7
00:00:31.341 --> 00:00:33.674
will need your strength.

8
00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:35.799
I know I can count
on you, Elinor.


9
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.299
You must hold our
family together.


10
00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:45.174
Father, I came
as soon as I could.


11
00:00:45.216 --> 00:00:47.549
Oh, John.

12
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.174
Listen to me, my son.

13
00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:52.674
The law forbids me from
dividing my estate.


14
00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:55.715
To include your
sisters and stepmother,


15
00:00:55.757 --> 00:00:59.341
my fortune will be left
entirely in your hands.


16
00:00:59.383 --> 00:01:00.882
Father, don't
worry about that now.


17
00:01:00.924 --> 00:01:01.882
I do worry.

18
00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:03.424
And you must promise me, John.

19
00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:05.258
You must promise me
that you will see


20
00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.049
that they are taken care of.

21
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:09.882
That is my wish.

22
00:01:15.632 --> 00:01:18.383
I promise, Father.

23
00:01:18.424 --> 00:01:21.299
I promise.

24
00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:50.424
The promise?

25
00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:53.133
Yes, the promise.

26
00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:54.216
3,000 pounds.

27
00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:55.383
Are you mad?

28
00:01:55.424 --> 00:01:57.841
1,000 for each of the girls.

29
00:01:57.882 --> 00:01:59.590
Barrister assured me
it was a fair amount.


30
00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:00.465
Is it not enough?

31
00:02:00.507 --> 00:02:01.383
Not enough?

32
00:02:01.424 --> 00:02:03.715
It's far too much.

33
00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:06.258
Even if you gave them half as
much, no other man on Earth


34
00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.049
would be half so generous
to his half-sisters.


35
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:11.549
So 1,500, then?

36
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.258
1,500 would be perfect,
if it is your intent to rob


37
00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.465
us of our rightful inheritance.

38
00:02:17.507 --> 00:02:21.258
Fanny, it is their
rightful inheritance too.


39
00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.549
Yet the law says differently.

40
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.715
But I promised Father.

41
00:02:26.757 --> 00:02:30.882
John, regardless of who
promised what to whom and when,


42
00:02:30.924 --> 00:02:34.549
the estate is yours to
do with as you see fit.


43
00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:49.258
The new master and mistress
of Norland Park have arrived.


44
00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.507
We are now guests
in our own home.


45
00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.716
I don't understand
why we have to leave.


46
00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:56.216
John and Fanny already
have a house in London.


47
00:02:56.258 --> 00:02:58.007
Yes.

48
00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.757
One must assume taking what's
ours gives them great pleasure.


49
00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:00.716
Stop it.

50
00:03:00.757 --> 00:03:02.382
Our brother is a good man.

51
00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:04.424
John will honor father's wishes.

52
00:03:04.465 --> 00:03:06.133
He'll certainly allow
us the time we need


53
00:03:06.174 --> 00:03:07.341
to find a suitable new home.

54
00:03:10.258 --> 00:03:12.216
Hold.

55
00:03:22.258 --> 00:03:26.174
Mary and my dear sisters.

56
00:03:26.216 --> 00:03:27.549
John.

57
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.258
I trust you had a
pleasant journey.


58
00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:30.799
Yes, thank you.

59
00:03:30.841 --> 00:03:33.049
And thank you for
the warm welcome.


60
00:03:33.091 --> 00:03:36.757
I hope to make this
transition as easy as pos--


61
00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.174
Norland Park, how I've
dreamed of this day.


62
00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:50.841
John, I was hoping
we could discuss


63
00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:52.299
your plans for the estate.

64
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.882
Oh, yes.

65
00:03:53.924 --> 00:03:56.549
Yes, of course, all
things in good time.


66
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.841
But first, I-- I do have
to check in on Fanny.


67
00:04:00.882 --> 00:04:01.632
Excuse me.

68
00:04:46.091 --> 00:04:47.424
Hello.

69
00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:49.133
Hello.

70
00:04:49.174 --> 00:04:51.382
I'm Edward Ferrars.

71
00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:53.841
You must be Miss Dashwood.

72
00:04:53.882 --> 00:04:55.382
I am.

73
00:04:55.424 --> 00:04:57.049
Welcome to Norland Park.

74
00:04:57.091 --> 00:04:59.340
Your sister will be happy
to hear you arrived safely.


75
00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:01.174
Stepsister.

76
00:05:01.216 --> 00:05:04.216
And yes, Fanny is widely
known through the land for


77
00:05:04.257 --> 00:05:06.507
her deep concern for others.

78
00:05:09.424 --> 00:05:10.882
Shall I take you to the house?

79
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:20.257
I do hope that Fanny has been
treating you with civility.


80
00:05:20.299 --> 00:05:23.424
It shames me to say, but
Fanny takes after our mother.


81
00:05:23.465 --> 00:05:24.340
Stop.

82
00:05:24.382 --> 00:05:25.465
You shall not pass.

83
00:05:25.507 --> 00:05:27.216
Margaret.

84
00:05:27.257 --> 00:05:30.966
Good sir knight, I assure you
my intentions are honorable.


85
00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:31.632
I'm not a knight.

86
00:05:31.674 --> 00:05:32.966
I'm a pirate.

87
00:05:33.008 --> 00:05:33.841
Pirate?

88
00:05:33.883 --> 00:05:35.091
Oh, no.

89
00:05:35.133 --> 00:05:37.549
In that case, I hereby
surrender my vessel.


90
00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:39.049
Not good enough.

91
00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:40.091
Oh, ooohh.

92
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:45.674
Oooh.

93
00:05:45.716 --> 00:05:47.632
As
beautiful as Norland is,


94
00:05:47.674 --> 00:05:50.091
it requires many repairs.

95
00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:55.091
I'm frankly surprised
at the state of it.


96
00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:59.049
Yes, quite right.

97
00:05:59.091 --> 00:06:00.465
It'll be very expensive.

98
00:06:00.507 --> 00:06:05.465
Money will be much
tighter than we imagined.


99
00:06:05.507 --> 00:06:08.424
My dear Fanny, Norland
Park is a country manor.


100
00:06:08.465 --> 00:06:11.716
Too many changes
would ruin its charm.


101
00:06:11.757 --> 00:06:13.549
There is beauty in
its flaws, isn't there?


102
00:06:13.591 --> 00:06:15.382
I think Father--

103
00:06:21.465 --> 00:06:24.966
So, Mr. Ferrars, tell us.

104
00:06:25.008 --> 00:06:27.049
How long are you to
stay at Norland Park?


105
00:06:27.091 --> 00:06:30.174
That depends entirely on the
hospitality of Mrs. Dashwood.


106
00:06:30.215 --> 00:06:31.091
You may stay--

107
00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:33.382
I should think a month.

108
00:06:33.424 --> 00:06:39.091
Well, I would like to stay for
a month or so, perhaps longer.


109
00:07:19.257 --> 00:07:20.424
Mother.

110
00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:21.549
None of these will do.

111
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:23.299
They're all far too expensive.

112
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.382
But surely once
John distributes


113
00:07:25.424 --> 00:07:26.799
our share of the estate--

114
00:07:26.841 --> 00:07:28.424
You can't truly
still believe John


115
00:07:28.466 --> 00:07:30.132
intends to honor his promise.

116
00:07:30.174 --> 00:07:32.091
But he said.

117
00:07:32.132 --> 00:07:33.841
We all heard him.

118
00:07:33.883 --> 00:07:36.716
Mother, it's been months
since Father passed.


119
00:07:36.757 --> 00:07:38.966
And the most John has promised
is the occasional gift


120
00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:40.716
of fish and game.

121
00:07:40.758 --> 00:07:42.382
And if we count on even that,
we'll all go hungry, won't we?


122
00:07:42.424 --> 00:07:44.382
But there is good news.

123
00:07:44.424 --> 00:07:45.632
I've been reaching
out to family.


124
00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.215
You haven't.

125
00:07:47.257 --> 00:07:50.382
How embarrassing.

126
00:07:50.424 --> 00:07:52.049
Yes.

127
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:53.799
Well, I've received a
response from your father's


128
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:56.966
cousin, Sir John Middleton
of Barton Park in Devonshire.


129
00:07:57.008 --> 00:07:58.424
Who?

130
00:07:58.466 --> 00:08:00.924
I've never met any Sir
John of Barton Park.


131
00:08:00.966 --> 00:08:03.591
None of us have,
but he is family.


132
00:08:03.632 --> 00:08:05.507
It seems his wife
recently passed,


133
00:08:05.549 --> 00:08:07.799
and he's sympathetic
to our situation.


134
00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:11.424
He has a cottage he will rent
us at a very affordable price.


135
00:08:11.466 --> 00:08:14.382
A cottage?

136
00:08:14.424 --> 00:08:18.090
We're to go from Norland
Park to a cottage.


137
00:08:18.132 --> 00:08:20.215
Mother.

138
00:08:20.257 --> 00:08:21.382
Very well.

139
00:08:21.424 --> 00:08:22.716
I, for one,
don't care where we


140
00:08:22.758 --> 00:08:24.174
go as long as we're
far away from John


141
00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:25.215
and his horrible wife.

142
00:08:27.424 --> 00:08:29.215
I apologize for
the interruption,


143
00:08:29.257 --> 00:08:32.632
but I was hoping to get better
acquainted with Norland's


144
00:08:32.674 --> 00:08:34.299
beautiful gardens.

145
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.549
And I was hoping for a guide.

146
00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:46.340
Devonshire is beautiful country.

147
00:08:46.382 --> 00:08:50.049
I actually spent some time
there during my schooling years.


148
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.424
Oh.

149
00:08:51.466 --> 00:08:54.966
Well, if you're ever
feeling nostalgic,


150
00:08:55.008 --> 00:08:58.799
you always have an open
invitation to stay with us,


151
00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:00.215
if it suits you, of course.

152
00:09:00.257 --> 00:09:01.632
It would be my honor.

153
00:09:12.591 --> 00:09:16.049
My mother and I have great
expectations for Edward.


154
00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:17.758
I'm sure.

155
00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:19.841
My mother has
made it plain that she would


156
00:09:19.883 --> 00:09:22.507
withdraw all his
inheritance should he choose


157
00:09:22.549 --> 00:09:27.924
to marry someone unworthy.

158
00:09:27.966 --> 00:09:30.924
It falls to me to make sure
that both Edward and Robert


159
00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:35.841
marry the right kind of woman.

160
00:09:35.883 --> 00:09:39.549
You understand, don't you?

161
00:09:39.591 --> 00:09:41.591
I understand you perfectly.

162
00:09:44.716 --> 00:09:46.549
We're grateful for
the hospitality you've


163
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:49.132
shown during our time of need.

164
00:09:49.174 --> 00:09:54.049
Rest assured, we will be leaving
Norland Park within the week.


165
00:10:02.883 --> 00:10:05.215
Edward, do you
promise you'll visit?


166
00:10:05.257 --> 00:10:06.215
You have my word.

167
00:10:10.174 --> 00:10:17.257
Uh-- it has been a true pleasure
making your acquaintance,


168
00:10:17.299 --> 00:10:18.382
Miss Dashwood.

169
00:10:18.424 --> 00:10:20.382
And you as well, Mr. Ferrars.

170
00:10:20.424 --> 00:10:23.215
I want you to know that I'm--

171
00:10:23.257 --> 00:10:28.716
that I'm-- I'm not very
good at this sort of thing.


172
00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:31.591
I wish that I could
accompany you on your travels


173
00:10:31.633 --> 00:10:33.382
and offer whatever
help I'm able.


174
00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:39.382
But-- but the fact
is there are--


175
00:10:39.424 --> 00:10:42.049
Obligations?

176
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.382
Complications.

177
00:10:44.424 --> 00:10:45.841
Yes.

178
00:10:45.883 --> 00:10:48.799
Well, life is nothing
if not complicated.


179
00:10:51.382 --> 00:10:53.215
I shall visit you.

180
00:10:53.257 --> 00:10:59.299
And in the meantime, I
want you to have this.


181
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:00.424
It's for your sketches.

182
00:11:06.466 --> 00:11:08.090
Thank you.

183
00:11:08.132 --> 00:11:10.257
I look forward to
filling these pages.


184
00:11:10.299 --> 00:11:14.090
And I to seeing them filled.

185
00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:17.299
Goodbye, Miss Dashwood.

186
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:48.257
It's not fair.

187
00:11:48.299 --> 00:11:52.382
What kind of law would deprive
us of our rightful inheritance?


188
00:11:52.424 --> 00:11:55.132
The world can
be a harsh place.


189
00:11:55.174 --> 00:11:59.674
It may only be temporary,
for you at least.


190
00:11:59.716 --> 00:12:00.758
Don't look at me like that.

191
00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:02.758
I'm talking about Edward.

192
00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:04.549
Your affection for one
another was obvious.


193
00:12:04.591 --> 00:12:06.090
Mother is convinced
you will wed.


194
00:12:06.132 --> 00:12:07.674
I'm certain there's no--

195
00:12:07.716 --> 00:12:10.216
Do you love him?

196
00:12:10.257 --> 00:12:12.382
Marianne.

197
00:12:12.424 --> 00:12:15.758
Elinor, do you love him?

198
00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:23.382
I-- I think very highly
of him, greatly esteem him.


199
00:12:23.424 --> 00:12:25.090
Esteem him?

200
00:12:25.132 --> 00:12:26.299
Like him?
- Shhhh.


201
00:12:26.341 --> 00:12:27.716
Cold-hearted
Elinor, shall I throw


202
00:12:27.758 --> 00:12:28.799
you from this
carriage to get you


203
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.965
to admit you feel something?

204
00:12:30.007 --> 00:12:31.840
You're going to
wake Mother and Meg.


205
00:12:31.882 --> 00:12:33.216
Don't you wish to be in love?

206
00:12:36.758 --> 00:12:42.007
For you, Marianne, the
wish is to hope, and to hope


207
00:12:42.049 --> 00:12:44.341
is to expect.

208
00:12:44.382 --> 00:12:49.382
I think it best not to get
my hopes, expectations up.


209
00:12:55.424 --> 00:12:58.049
It's very--

210
00:12:58.090 --> 00:12:58.882
Small?

211
00:12:58.924 --> 00:13:01.549
Cozy?

212
00:13:01.591 --> 00:13:03.758
The Dashwood women arrive.

213
00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:05.758
Sir John Middleton I presume.

214
00:13:05.799 --> 00:13:07.674
You presume correctly.

215
00:13:07.716 --> 00:13:12.299
Lovely to finally make
your acquaintance.


216
00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:14.382
Welcome to Devonshire.

217
00:13:14.424 --> 00:13:16.132
Sir John, we must thank you.

218
00:13:16.174 --> 00:13:17.049
No, no, no, no, no.

219
00:13:17.091 --> 00:13:18.757
No thanks necessary.

220
00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:20.257
You do me a favor by moving in.

221
00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.716
It gave me the excuse I
needed to clean this place up.


222
00:13:22.757 --> 00:13:25.382
Well, at least
accept our condolences


223
00:13:25.424 --> 00:13:26.716
on your wife's passing.

224
00:13:26.757 --> 00:13:28.174
And
mine on your husband's.


225
00:13:28.216 --> 00:13:29.591
He was a wonderful man.

226
00:13:29.633 --> 00:13:32.341
And yes, Lady Middleton
left us far too soon.


227
00:13:32.382 --> 00:13:34.882
The worst of it was she left
me alone with my mother-in-law.


228
00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:38.424
And I jest.

229
00:13:38.466 --> 00:13:39.799
I jest.

230
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.049
Mrs. Jennings is a
delightful woman.


231
00:13:41.091 --> 00:13:42.716
Well, perhaps delightful
is overstating it.


232
00:13:42.757 --> 00:13:44.549
She's not at all
unpleasant, mostly.


233
00:13:44.591 --> 00:13:45.757
Anyway, you'll see for
yourself tonight when you


234
00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:47.466
come to dine at Barton Park.

235
00:13:47.508 --> 00:13:49.382
In fact, I insist you
dine with us every night


236
00:13:49.424 --> 00:13:50.840
until you're fully settled in.

237
00:13:50.882 --> 00:13:52.757
And to that end, my servant
Thomas will be assisting


238
00:13:52.799 --> 00:13:54.299
you with your every need.

239
00:13:54.341 --> 00:13:55.674
That's gracious of you.

240
00:13:55.715 --> 00:13:57.257
Are you sure you can spare--

241
00:13:57.299 --> 00:13:58.715
Of course I can.

242
00:13:58.757 --> 00:14:00.549
Thomas is a mediocre
servant at best.


243
00:14:00.591 --> 00:14:02.049
I'm sure he won't be missed.

244
00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:03.882
Now, I'll get out of your
way and let you unpack.


245
00:14:03.924 --> 00:14:06.049
I'll send a carriage down
to collect you this evening.


246
00:14:06.091 --> 00:14:06.840
Ta-ta.

247
00:14:11.341 --> 00:14:13.257
Well, he's certainly--

248
00:14:26.216 --> 00:14:27.840
Look, Marianne, a pianoforte.

249
00:14:33.591 --> 00:14:36.549
Look what we've
been reduced to.


250
00:14:36.591 --> 00:14:39.549
Mother, stop.

251
00:14:39.591 --> 00:14:40.799
We have a lovely new home.

252
00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.882
We're very fortunate.

253
00:14:41.924 --> 00:14:44.633
I was mistress
of Norland Park.


254
00:14:44.674 --> 00:14:47.424
What am I now?

255
00:14:47.466 --> 00:14:50.049
This world is so cruel.

256
00:14:50.091 --> 00:14:52.924
There is kindness in
it, like your cousin.


257
00:14:52.965 --> 00:14:56.091
He's a lovely man, and he seems
genuinely happy to have us


258
00:14:56.132 --> 00:14:57.508
here, doesn't he?

259
00:14:57.549 --> 00:15:01.132
But we have no carriage,
no land of our own,


260
00:15:01.174 --> 00:15:04.383
and no money for your dowry.

261
00:15:04.424 --> 00:15:06.049
We have nothing.

262
00:15:11.383 --> 00:15:12.174
We have each other.

263
00:15:32.424 --> 00:15:33.840
Dinner was wonderful.

264
00:15:33.882 --> 00:15:36.341
I send my compliments
to the chef.


265
00:15:36.383 --> 00:15:39.299
Oh, I am so glad
you enjoyed it.


266
00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:41.007
We must talk suitors.

267
00:15:41.049 --> 00:15:43.799
I know every eligible
bachelor in the county,


268
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.591
and Elinor and Marianne
will meet them all


269
00:15:46.632 --> 00:15:48.424
and take their pick.

270
00:15:48.466 --> 00:15:51.257
It's so lovely having
you at Barton Park.


271
00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:53.466
Sir John can be such a bore.

272
00:15:53.508 --> 00:15:55.299
I'm the bore, the way
you always prattle on?


273
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:56.174
Prattle?

274
00:15:56.216 --> 00:15:57.549
I don't prattle.

275
00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:58.966
You don't think I
prattle, do you, dear?


276
00:16:02.424 --> 00:16:04.174
Oh, Brandon.

277
00:16:04.216 --> 00:16:05.549
There you are.

278
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:07.383
I'm afraid you've
missed dinner, old chap.


279
00:16:07.424 --> 00:16:08.924
My deepest apologies.
I'm afraid--


280
00:16:08.966 --> 00:16:10.299
No, no, no.
No, not at all.


281
00:16:10.341 --> 00:16:11.882
The roast was
rather dry, in fact.


282
00:16:11.924 --> 00:16:14.549
But as you can see, we have
company to provide a feast


283
00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.715
for the eyes, ears, and soul.

284
00:16:16.757 --> 00:16:20.132
Mrs. Dashwood, Miss Dashwood,
Margaret, Dashwood, Marianne


285
00:16:20.174 --> 00:16:26.383
Dashwood, allow me to present
Colonel Brandon, an old friend


286
00:16:26.424 --> 00:16:28.049
and military hero.

287
00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:30.715
We served together in the
East Indies, you know.


288
00:16:30.757 --> 00:16:32.799
It's a pleasure
to meet you all.


289
00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.049
You play beautifully.

290
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:36.757
Thank you.

291
00:16:36.799 --> 00:16:38.466
Do you live nearby, Colonel?

292
00:16:38.508 --> 00:16:41.007
Quite but not near enough, it
seems, to be on time for dinner


293
00:16:41.049 --> 00:16:41.674
apparently.

294
00:16:41.715 --> 00:16:43.174
Again, I apologize.

295
00:16:43.216 --> 00:16:45.174
Only joking, Colonel.

296
00:16:45.216 --> 00:16:49.258
So serious this one
but such a gentleman.


297
00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:51.174
You should see his
home, Delaford.


298
00:16:51.216 --> 00:16:56.091
It's simply majestic but
could use a woman's touch.


299
00:16:59.715 --> 00:17:01.715
That was a dreadful evening.

300
00:17:01.757 --> 00:17:04.508
Sir John and Mrs.
Jennings talk incessantly.


301
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:06.966
Neither listened to
a single note played.


302
00:17:07.007 --> 00:17:09.799
Colonel Brandon seemed
quite fond of the music


303
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.216
and the hands that played it.

304
00:17:12.258 --> 00:17:13.840
Stop it.

305
00:17:13.882 --> 00:17:15.424
Did you not find him handsome?

306
00:17:15.466 --> 00:17:17.049
Did you not find
him to be pleasant?


307
00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:20.715
I found him to be mature
and far too reserved for me.


308
00:17:20.757 --> 00:17:22.924
What could we possibly
have in common?


309
00:17:22.966 --> 00:17:26.091
Besides a love of
music, a strong interest


310
00:17:26.132 --> 00:17:28.549
in you to start.

311
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.216
He's a military man.

312
00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:32.590
I doubt he has a single
romantic bone in his body.


313
00:17:35.715 --> 00:17:37.091
I could never be
with someone whose


314
00:17:37.132 --> 00:17:38.757
tastes did not
coincide with mine own


315
00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:40.882
in every conceivable way.

316
00:17:40.924 --> 00:17:43.007
The more I come to know the
world, the more convinced


317
00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:45.590
I am I'll never find
someone I could truly love.


318
00:17:45.632 --> 00:17:47.590
Little young to despair
of ever finding happiness,


319
00:17:47.632 --> 00:17:48.715
aren't you?

320
00:17:48.757 --> 00:17:50.216
You don't understand, Elinor.

321
00:17:50.258 --> 00:17:51.507
I require so much.

322
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:59.091
On that, Marianne,
we can agree.


323
00:18:07.966 --> 00:18:11.424
"Thus, happiness
depends, as nature shows,


324
00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:14.258
less on exterior things
than most suppose."


325
00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:15.882
What's that?

326
00:18:15.924 --> 00:18:19.258
William Cowper, the most
romantic poet that ever lived.


327
00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:22.133
He's saying that happiness
lies in the heart and not


328
00:18:22.174 --> 00:18:24.174
in material possessions.

329
00:18:24.216 --> 00:18:25.841
When's Edward coming to visit?

330
00:18:25.882 --> 00:18:28.299
He said he'd come as
soon as we were settled.


331
00:18:28.341 --> 00:18:29.715
We've been up here for weeks.

332
00:18:29.757 --> 00:18:32.383
Elinor must be upset.

333
00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:33.882
Elinor doesn't get upset.

334
00:18:33.924 --> 00:18:36.674
With Elinor, it's always
prudence and duty,


335
00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:38.549
resignation and acceptance.

336
00:18:41.465 --> 00:18:42.383
Look.

337
00:18:42.424 --> 00:18:44.216
Is it Colonel Brandon?

338
00:18:44.258 --> 00:18:46.882
Mrs. Jennings said he would
make a good husband for you.


339
00:18:46.924 --> 00:18:49.383
Mrs. Jennings doesn't know
the first thing about me.


340
00:18:49.424 --> 00:18:51.549
Let's ask him what he thinks.

341
00:18:56.299 --> 00:18:57.091
Meg, don't.

342
00:18:59.882 --> 00:19:00.882
Ow.

343
00:19:00.924 --> 00:19:01.715
Marianne.

344
00:19:08.715 --> 00:19:10.216
Marianne, are you all right?

345
00:19:10.258 --> 00:19:11.091
My ankle.

346
00:19:14.715 --> 00:19:18.007
Are you all right?

347
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:19.133
Don't be afraid.

348
00:19:19.174 --> 00:19:22.049
I only wish to help.

349
00:19:22.091 --> 00:19:23.632
May I?

350
00:19:28.757 --> 00:19:32.382
Well, the good news is
it doesn't appear broken.


351
00:19:32.424 --> 00:19:34.549
You've got quite the sprain.

352
00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:35.716
May I escort you home?

353
00:19:38.299 --> 00:19:39.966
Who are you?

354
00:19:40.007 --> 00:19:41.091
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:41.133 --> 00:19:42.674
Where are my manners?

356
00:19:42.716 --> 00:19:44.841
John Willoughby,
at your service.


357
00:19:54.299 --> 00:19:57.299
Mother, we simply cannot
afford a new chimney.


358
00:19:57.341 --> 00:19:58.216
You know this.

359
00:19:58.258 --> 00:20:00.174
I know no such thing.

360
00:20:00.216 --> 00:20:02.341
Smoke billowing inside
the house all day,


361
00:20:02.382 --> 00:20:04.924
all of us constantly beating
soot from our clothing,


362
00:20:04.966 --> 00:20:08.341
is this how you really
expect us to live?


363
00:20:08.382 --> 00:20:09.757
Fine.
Fine.


364
00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:11.133
We'll get a new chimney.

365
00:20:11.174 --> 00:20:14.091
We'll just forego a few
minor things like hmm--


366
00:20:14.133 --> 00:20:15.882
ah, food.

367
00:20:15.924 --> 00:20:17.340
Mother.

368
00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:18.174
It's Marianne.

369
00:20:18.216 --> 00:20:19.008
She fell.

370
00:20:19.049 --> 00:20:20.049
But the man--

371
00:20:20.091 --> 00:20:22.424
What man?

372
00:20:22.465 --> 00:20:23.674
Where can I--

373
00:20:23.716 --> 00:20:24.507
Oh.
Oh.


374
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:25.340
Here.

375
00:20:28.049 --> 00:20:28.882
Oh.

376
00:20:28.924 --> 00:20:30.757
Marianne, are you all right?

377
00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:31.924
What happened?

378
00:20:31.966 --> 00:20:35.133
She's fine, just
a sprained ankle.


379
00:20:35.174 --> 00:20:37.216
Who are you?

380
00:20:37.258 --> 00:20:38.590
John Willoughby.

381
00:20:38.632 --> 00:20:40.966
I was out hunting,
and I saw her fall.


382
00:20:41.008 --> 00:20:44.008
I fear I may have given the
young ladies quite the scare.


383
00:20:44.049 --> 00:20:44.757
Not at all.

384
00:20:44.799 --> 00:20:45.966
Don't be silly.

385
00:20:46.008 --> 00:20:47.757
Thank goodness you were there.

386
00:20:47.799 --> 00:20:49.674
May I offer you some tea?

387
00:20:49.716 --> 00:20:51.340
I don't want to trouble you.

388
00:20:51.382 --> 00:20:53.674
I only wanted to see your
lovely daughters safely home,


389
00:20:53.716 --> 00:20:55.340
and I have done that.

390
00:20:55.382 --> 00:20:59.340
Although, if I may, I'd like
to come back tomorrow to check


391
00:20:59.382 --> 00:21:02.216
on the patient's progress.

392
00:21:02.258 --> 00:21:05.382
Is that all right?

393
00:21:05.424 --> 00:21:06.757
Yes.

394
00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.299
Yes, of course.

395
00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.008
Then I'll away.

396
00:21:10.049 --> 00:21:11.507
It's been a pleasure
meeting you,


397
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:14.216
Marianne, despite
the circumstances.


398
00:21:25.216 --> 00:21:27.841
Ah, yes,
the dashing Mr. Willoughby.


399
00:21:27.882 --> 00:21:30.424
He comes to Devonshire every
year to visit his aunt.


400
00:21:30.465 --> 00:21:33.549
Who resides at Allenham
Court, the estate he will


401
00:21:33.591 --> 00:21:35.174
one day inherit.

402
00:21:35.216 --> 00:21:36.591
Is he married?

403
00:21:36.632 --> 00:21:39.174
He is not.

404
00:21:39.216 --> 00:21:44.424
He is unattached and stands to
become extraordinarily wealthy.


405
00:21:48.591 --> 00:21:50.799
Oh, I see what's
happening here.


406
00:21:50.841 --> 00:21:52.465
Poor Brandon.

407
00:21:52.507 --> 00:21:55.507
It seems he's no match for
Willoughby in Marianne's eyes,


408
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:57.757
though perhaps Miss Elinor--

409
00:21:57.799 --> 00:21:59.674
Elinor already has a suitor.

410
00:21:59.716 --> 00:22:00.632
Margaret.

411
00:22:00.674 --> 00:22:02.174
Really?

412
00:22:02.216 --> 00:22:04.091
And why is this the first
that I am hearing of it?


413
00:22:04.133 --> 00:22:04.924
Pray tell.

414
00:22:04.966 --> 00:22:07.174
Who is the lucky young man?

415
00:22:07.216 --> 00:22:08.216
I won't say his name.

416
00:22:08.257 --> 00:22:09.632
Oh.

417
00:22:09.674 --> 00:22:12.257
But his surname begins
with the letter F.


418
00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:13.883
Ooh, mystery, is it?

419
00:22:13.924 --> 00:22:16.340
I do love a good riddle.

420
00:22:16.382 --> 00:22:18.174
Ooh, let's see.

421
00:22:18.215 --> 00:22:21.424
F for Franklin?

422
00:22:21.465 --> 00:22:22.674
Frederick?

423
00:22:22.716 --> 00:22:24.174
Fiddlesticks.

424
00:22:24.215 --> 00:22:25.008
Fiddlesticks.

425
00:22:30.632 --> 00:22:32.340
I love your cottage.

426
00:22:32.382 --> 00:22:34.299
It's been empty too long.

427
00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.549
To see it occupied now and
by such wonderful women,


428
00:22:37.591 --> 00:22:40.008
it does my heart good.

429
00:22:40.049 --> 00:22:43.340
How long will you
be in Devonshire?


430
00:22:43.382 --> 00:22:44.340
Difficult to say.

431
00:22:44.382 --> 00:22:45.757
It is beautiful out here.

432
00:22:45.799 --> 00:22:47.966
And Allenham Court will
one day be my home,


433
00:22:48.008 --> 00:22:55.091
but sometimes I find
Devonshire a bit dull.


434
00:22:55.133 --> 00:22:56.174
Oh.

435
00:22:56.215 --> 00:22:57.841
Young women throwing
themselves down


436
00:22:57.883 --> 00:22:59.924
hillsides just to meet you
doesn't happen every day?


437
00:23:02.966 --> 00:23:07.632
It is nice to have others
of an age close to my own.


438
00:23:07.674 --> 00:23:10.507
Let's see what else
we have in common.


439
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:13.174
Who's your favorite artist?

440
00:23:13.215 --> 00:23:17.424
Ah, don't make
me choose just one.


441
00:23:17.465 --> 00:23:18.716
Boucher.

442
00:23:18.757 --> 00:23:20.008
Ooh, Panini.

443
00:23:20.049 --> 00:23:21.174
I love them.

444
00:23:21.215 --> 00:23:22.215
Favorite poet.

445
00:23:22.257 --> 00:23:23.091
Phillis Wheatley.

446
00:23:23.133 --> 00:23:24.966
Phillis Wheatley.

447
00:23:25.008 --> 00:23:28.632
"Thy various works,
imperial queen, we see."


448
00:23:28.674 --> 00:23:29.883
"How bright their forms!

449
00:23:29.924 --> 00:23:32.091
How deck'd with pomp by thee!"

450
00:23:39.757 --> 00:23:41.757
Willoughby, welcome
back to Devonshire.


451
00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:42.841
Now, how is your aunt?

452
00:23:42.883 --> 00:23:44.466
Still in good health, I hope.

453
00:23:44.507 --> 00:23:46.757
She is well, thank you-- on
a trip to London at present.


454
00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:48.008
Good evening, everyone.

455
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:49.674
Colonel Brandon,
now that you're here,


456
00:23:49.716 --> 00:23:51.340
shall we adjourn to dinner?
Come my, dear.


457
00:23:51.382 --> 00:23:52.924
Allow me.

458
00:23:52.966 --> 00:23:54.008
Good to see that ankle is
in good health, but let's


459
00:23:54.049 --> 00:23:54.841
not test it.

460
00:23:57.507 --> 00:24:01.174
Colonel Brandon,
sir, good to see you.


461
00:24:01.215 --> 00:24:03.008
Mr. Willoughby.

462
00:24:29.883 --> 00:24:33.591
That is beautiful.

463
00:24:33.632 --> 00:24:35.591
You must give me some
pointers on how to play.


464
00:24:35.632 --> 00:24:37.507
It appears Mr.
Willoughby was quite moved


465
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:38.883
by Marianne's performance.

466
00:24:38.924 --> 00:24:41.966
Oh, let them have their fun.

467
00:24:42.008 --> 00:24:43.090
Excuse me.

468
00:24:43.132 --> 00:24:44.257
To be young again.

469
00:24:44.299 --> 00:24:45.883
When
were you ever young?


470
00:24:45.924 --> 00:24:48.008
I was speaking with Sir
John about a piece of land


471
00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:49.716
owned by my sister's husband.

472
00:24:49.758 --> 00:24:52.049
It's naught but a few
hours' ride by carriage.


473
00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.257
We thought it might be nice
to take an excursion out


474
00:24:54.299 --> 00:24:55.257
there for a picnic.

475
00:24:55.299 --> 00:24:56.424
That sounds lovely, Colonel.

476
00:24:58.883 --> 00:25:00.424
Do tell Marianne
that Mr. Willoughby


477
00:25:00.466 --> 00:25:03.299
will also be invited.

478
00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:04.424
Colonel?

479
00:25:04.466 --> 00:25:07.424
My sister, she's
a true romantic,


480
00:25:07.466 --> 00:25:08.966
and I love her for it.

481
00:25:09.008 --> 00:25:14.549
But she lacks propriety and
I'm afraid common sense.


482
00:25:14.591 --> 00:25:16.132
I must say I do look
forward to a day


483
00:25:16.174 --> 00:25:18.674
where she's better
acquainted with the world.


484
00:25:20.632 --> 00:25:23.049
Miss Dashwood, I once
knew someone very much


485
00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.924
like your sister but
who, due to a series


486
00:25:25.966 --> 00:25:27.841
of unfortunate circumstances--

487
00:25:31.008 --> 00:25:33.049
the world can be a
very cruel place.


488
00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:34.799
Do not wish for the
day that your sister


489
00:25:34.841 --> 00:25:37.257
discovers that for herself.

490
00:25:46.632 --> 00:25:47.799
Do you fancy her?

491
00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:49.257
She's beautiful.

492
00:25:49.299 --> 00:25:51.632
She's yours.

493
00:25:51.674 --> 00:25:53.341
She's what?

494
00:25:53.382 --> 00:25:56.841
She's yours, if that is, you
have something of equal value


495
00:25:56.883 --> 00:25:58.341
to trade for her.

496
00:25:58.382 --> 00:26:02.716
I'm afraid I don't have
much of value, not any more.


497
00:26:02.758 --> 00:26:06.174
Well, what do you
have on you right now?


498
00:26:06.215 --> 00:26:08.382
Nothing.

499
00:26:08.424 --> 00:26:11.299
Just a handkerchief.

500
00:26:11.341 --> 00:26:12.924
Perfect.

501
00:26:12.966 --> 00:26:15.674
Anything you've ever held
will be more than enough.


502
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:24.841
Elinor, look.

503
00:26:24.883 --> 00:26:27.299
Willoughby gave me the
most wonderful gift.


504
00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:29.299
I think I'll call her Queen Mab.

505
00:26:29.341 --> 00:26:30.674
What, the horse?

506
00:26:30.716 --> 00:26:33.132
Marianne, we can't keep it.

507
00:26:33.174 --> 00:26:34.758
But we have a
perfectly good stable.


508
00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:36.215
What will we
feed it, Marianne?


509
00:26:36.257 --> 00:26:37.090
Who will groom it?

510
00:26:37.132 --> 00:26:38.257
I'm sorry.

511
00:26:38.299 --> 00:26:39.965
Clearly, I did not
think this through.


512
00:26:40.007 --> 00:26:42.424
My aunt always says I
can be a bit impulsive.


513
00:26:42.466 --> 00:26:43.674
As well you should be.

514
00:26:43.716 --> 00:26:45.424
Our impulses are never wrong.

515
00:26:45.466 --> 00:26:48.424
Well, in this case, they were.

516
00:26:48.466 --> 00:26:50.716
The last thing I want to do
is cause you any hardship,


517
00:26:50.758 --> 00:26:53.591
but perhaps I can
offer a solution.


518
00:26:53.633 --> 00:26:56.799
I will keep Queen Mab in
the stables at Allenham.


519
00:26:56.841 --> 00:26:58.965
She will still be
yours, and you can come


520
00:26:59.007 --> 00:27:03.424
visit her and ride her anytime.

521
00:27:03.466 --> 00:27:06.883
I hope that will be quite often.

522
00:27:06.924 --> 00:27:10.215
Thank you, Mr. Willoughby.

523
00:27:10.257 --> 00:27:11.758
Not at all.

524
00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:13.841
I do apologize for any
trouble I may have caused.


525
00:27:13.883 --> 00:27:15.382
Will you be joining
us on the trip


526
00:27:15.424 --> 00:27:16.841
Colonel Brandon has arranged?

527
00:27:16.883 --> 00:27:18.633
Well, if the lovely
and talented Dashwood


528
00:27:18.674 --> 00:27:20.341
sisters are going
to be there, I would


529
00:27:20.382 --> 00:27:23.924
not miss it for the world.

530
00:27:23.965 --> 00:27:25.424
Shall we go for a ride?

531
00:27:35.633 --> 00:27:38.591
It's so beautiful.

532
00:27:38.633 --> 00:27:40.507
My favorite horse.

533
00:27:44.466 --> 00:27:45.924
Take this.

534
00:27:45.965 --> 00:27:48.090
For the last time,
I do not prattle.


535
00:27:48.132 --> 00:27:48.799
You do.

536
00:27:48.841 --> 00:27:49.924
You do, too.

537
00:27:52.507 --> 00:27:55.633
I think I'll write a letter to
Edward, inviting him to visit.


538
00:27:55.674 --> 00:27:56.716
You'll do no such thing.

539
00:27:56.758 --> 00:27:58.382
He's already been invited.

540
00:27:58.424 --> 00:27:59.799
Elinor.

541
00:27:59.841 --> 00:28:02.758
I just want for both my
daughters to be happy.


542
00:28:02.799 --> 00:28:04.633
Mother, my happiness
does not depend


543
00:28:04.674 --> 00:28:06.466
on the affections of another.

544
00:28:06.507 --> 00:28:07.466
Doesn't hurt though.

545
00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:13.758
Colonel Brandon.

546
00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:15.174
I have a message for you.

547
00:28:26.299 --> 00:28:27.758
I'm so sorry.

548
00:28:27.799 --> 00:28:28.840
I'm afraid I can't
accompany you on the picnic.


549
00:28:28.882 --> 00:28:30.257
My horse, quickly.

550
00:28:30.299 --> 00:28:31.257
But it's your
brother-in-law's property.


551
00:28:31.299 --> 00:28:32.174
We can't go without you.

552
00:28:32.216 --> 00:28:33.382
I apologize, but
I've been called


553
00:28:33.424 --> 00:28:34.549
on urgent business in London.

554
00:28:34.591 --> 00:28:35.924
Come now, Brandon.

555
00:28:35.965 --> 00:28:37.424
Surely, this business
is not so urgent you


556
00:28:37.466 --> 00:28:38.716
can't postpone it one day.

557
00:28:38.758 --> 00:28:40.257
Not one hour.

558
00:28:45.382 --> 00:28:48.174
I wonder what this
urgent business could be?


559
00:28:48.216 --> 00:28:49.299
I suspect I know.

560
00:28:49.341 --> 00:28:51.924
A little bird told
me that the Colonel


561
00:28:51.965 --> 00:28:58.216
has a certain ongoing obligation
in London, a daughter.


562
00:28:58.257 --> 00:28:59.049
A daughter?

563
00:29:01.799 --> 00:29:04.216
I didn't know the
Colonel had been married.


564
00:29:04.257 --> 00:29:07.341
He hasn't been.

565
00:29:07.382 --> 00:29:09.299
We've spoken more than
enough of the Colonel.


566
00:29:09.341 --> 00:29:11.549
And although he may
have foiled our plans,


567
00:29:11.591 --> 00:29:13.466
it is far too beautiful
of a day to let


568
00:29:13.508 --> 00:29:15.132
it go to waste all together.

569
00:29:15.174 --> 00:29:17.049
The fair Marianne
and I are going


570
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:18.758
for a ride in the countryside.

571
00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:19.591
Catch us if you can.

572
00:29:19.633 --> 00:29:20.466
Yah.

573
00:29:27.924 --> 00:29:30.758
This, Marianne, is Allenham.

574
00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:32.758
It's so beautiful.

575
00:29:32.799 --> 00:29:34.882
And all of this is to be yours?

576
00:29:34.924 --> 00:29:41.924
One day, yes, mine, and
God willing, my family's.


577
00:29:41.965 --> 00:29:44.174
I think it would feel far
too empty without one.


578
00:29:49.591 --> 00:29:54.257
Marianne, my aunt will be back
from London in a few days.


579
00:29:54.299 --> 00:29:56.591
So I'll have to tend
to things around here,


580
00:29:56.633 --> 00:29:58.633
preparing for her return.

581
00:29:58.674 --> 00:30:02.840
But perhaps someday I could
pay a call to Barton Cottage.


582
00:30:02.882 --> 00:30:05.299
There's something
I'd like to ask you.


583
00:30:05.341 --> 00:30:08.924
And afterwards, I'd like
to have a conversation


584
00:30:08.965 --> 00:30:10.924
with your mother.

585
00:30:10.965 --> 00:30:12.508
Yes.

586
00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:13.633
Yes, of course.

587
00:30:25.591 --> 00:30:29.174
Why did I have to go to church
and Marianne got to stay home?


588
00:30:29.216 --> 00:30:31.757
Because Marianne is pure of
heart without an ounce of sin.


589
00:30:31.799 --> 00:30:33.257
No, she isn't.

590
00:30:33.299 --> 00:30:36.508
Marianne had to stay
home to receive a visitor.


591
00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:37.715
What visitor?

592
00:30:37.757 --> 00:30:38.633
Mr. Willoughby?

593
00:30:38.674 --> 00:30:40.216
Indeed.

594
00:30:40.257 --> 00:30:42.466
And your sister is about
to become Mrs. Willoughby.


595
00:30:42.508 --> 00:30:43.757
Marianne's getting married?

596
00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:46.341
We don't know
that for certain.


597
00:30:46.383 --> 00:30:49.132
I'm so glad Willoughby
came along when he did.


598
00:30:49.174 --> 00:30:52.257
If things between Marianne and
Colonel Brandon had progressed,


599
00:30:52.299 --> 00:30:54.383
your sister could have
ended up in a very


600
00:30:54.424 --> 00:30:57.799
complicated situation.

601
00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.383
Do you think it's true
what Mrs. Jennings


602
00:30:59.424 --> 00:31:02.965
said about him, that he had
a daughter out of wedlock?


603
00:31:03.007 --> 00:31:04.174
Mother.

604
00:31:04.216 --> 00:31:06.091
Your daughters keep
you busy enough.


605
00:31:06.132 --> 00:31:08.174
Do you really need to
worry over someone else's?


606
00:31:12.633 --> 00:31:14.424
Mr. Willoughby,
what's going on?


607
00:31:14.466 --> 00:31:15.508
Where's Marianne?

608
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:16.799
She's inside.

609
00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.508
She's-- I'm afraid
she's a bit upset.


610
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:21.007
Upset?

611
00:31:21.049 --> 00:31:22.633
She didn't refuse you, did she?

612
00:31:22.674 --> 00:31:23.466
Mother.

613
00:31:23.508 --> 00:31:24.757
No.

614
00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:26.882
No, it's not-- my
aunt has decided


615
00:31:26.924 --> 00:31:28.508
to exercise some
of her privileges


616
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:30.174
on her dependent nephew.

617
00:31:30.216 --> 00:31:31.965
I'm leaving to
London for business.


618
00:31:32.007 --> 00:31:33.257
I leave straight away.

619
00:31:33.299 --> 00:31:35.007
When will you return?

620
00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:39.257
I-- I'm only invited back
to Allenham once a year,


621
00:31:39.299 --> 00:31:41.591
so I most likely will not
be back for some time.


622
00:31:41.633 --> 00:31:43.216
But surely Sir
John could extend


623
00:31:43.257 --> 00:31:45.591
an invitation once your
business is concluded.


624
00:31:45.633 --> 00:31:46.965
Yes.

625
00:31:47.007 --> 00:31:48.257
Well, I'm not certain
when that will be.


626
00:31:48.299 --> 00:31:51.840
Things are-- that is
to say, things are--


627
00:31:51.882 --> 00:31:53.424
I should not linger.

628
00:31:53.466 --> 00:31:55.591
I will not torment myself
by remaining friends whose


629
00:31:55.633 --> 00:31:57.049
company I can no longer enjoy.

630
00:32:01.757 --> 00:32:03.924
Marianne.

631
00:32:03.966 --> 00:32:05.591
Please don't cry.

632
00:32:05.632 --> 00:32:07.007
Mother, let me talk to her.

633
00:32:07.049 --> 00:32:08.715
What is there to say?

634
00:32:08.757 --> 00:32:10.383
This would never have
happened if I was


635
00:32:10.424 --> 00:32:12.383
the mistress of Norland Park.

636
00:32:12.424 --> 00:32:13.257
Mother--

637
00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.799
Marianne?

638
00:32:21.299 --> 00:32:24.257
Over a week now and
still he's sent no letter.


639
00:32:24.299 --> 00:32:26.882
I know, but weeping
all night and refusing


640
00:32:26.924 --> 00:32:29.549
breakfast in the morning won't
make him write any sooner.


641
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:32.924
I'd be ashamed of myself if
I were able to eat or sleep.


642
00:32:32.966 --> 00:32:34.840
This is what true love
does to you, Elinor.


643
00:32:34.882 --> 00:32:37.799
You wouldn't understand.

644
00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.924
Well, perhaps you can
temper your grief a bit


645
00:32:41.966 --> 00:32:43.174
for the sake of Mother?

646
00:32:43.882 --> 00:32:45.007
Someone's coming.

647
00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:47.341
Willoughby-- he's come back.

648
00:32:47.383 --> 00:32:48.757
It's Edward.

649
00:32:58.757 --> 00:33:00.258
I knew you'd come.

650
00:33:00.299 --> 00:33:01.757
Oh, well, of course.

651
00:33:01.799 --> 00:33:03.799
I have to keep the
countryside free from pirates.


652
00:33:08.007 --> 00:33:10.757
Mr. Ferrars, such a
pleasure to see you again.


653
00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:13.091
Oh, thank you, 
Miss Dashwood.

654
00:33:13.132 --> 00:33:14.757
Marianne.

655
00:33:14.799 --> 00:33:17.882
I hope my invitation
has not expired.


656
00:33:17.924 --> 00:33:19.299
Of course not.

657
00:33:19.341 --> 00:33:20.924
I'm afraid I can only
stay for one night.


658
00:33:20.966 --> 00:33:22.757
I hope you don't think me rude.

659
00:33:22.799 --> 00:33:24.508
All the way from London
for just one night?


660
00:33:33.674 --> 00:33:36.674
It's a charming home.

661
00:33:36.715 --> 00:33:39.216
Are the Middletons
agreeable people?


662
00:33:39.258 --> 00:33:40.632
Not at all.

663
00:33:40.674 --> 00:33:42.299
We couldn't be more
unfortunately situated.


664
00:33:42.341 --> 00:33:43.924
Marianne, stop.

665
00:33:43.966 --> 00:33:46.508
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings
are very pleasant.


666
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:47.924
You'll meet them tonight.

667
00:33:47.966 --> 00:33:49.632
Once they find out
we have a guest,


668
00:33:49.674 --> 00:33:52.799
they'll want to
have us for dinner.


669
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.674
That's a nice ring.

670
00:33:54.715 --> 00:33:57.383
I didn't think you were
wearing it at Norland.


671
00:33:57.424 --> 00:33:58.632
Uh, no.

672
00:33:58.674 --> 00:33:59.590
Thank you.

673
00:33:59.632 --> 00:34:01.507
No, I wasn't.

674
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:03.174
It was a gift.

675
00:34:03.216 --> 00:34:04.174
A gift from whom?

676
00:34:04.216 --> 00:34:07.341
Marianne, it's
not our business.


677
00:34:07.383 --> 00:34:09.091
No, that's quite all right.

678
00:34:09.132 --> 00:34:09.924
Edward.

679
00:34:09.966 --> 00:34:11.132
Yes?

680
00:34:11.174 --> 00:34:12.424
Thomas has finished
preparing your room.


681
00:34:12.466 --> 00:34:13.424
Would you like to see it?

682
00:34:13.466 --> 00:34:14.799
Yes, of course.

683
00:34:14.841 --> 00:34:15.674
Thank you.

684
00:34:15.715 --> 00:34:16.507
Excuse me.

685
00:34:19.966 --> 00:34:21.299
He's going to propose.

686
00:34:21.341 --> 00:34:23.341
Marianne, why would
you say such a thing?


687
00:34:23.383 --> 00:34:26.466
Did you see how nervous
he was, how distracted?


688
00:34:26.507 --> 00:34:28.383
You've taken quite
the leap there.


689
00:34:28.424 --> 00:34:29.590
Elinor, I'm telling you.

690
00:34:29.632 --> 00:34:30.757
I know about these things.

691
00:34:30.799 --> 00:34:32.632
He's going to propose.

692
00:34:44.966 --> 00:34:46.258
Mr. Ferrars, tell me.

693
00:34:46.299 --> 00:34:50.966
Is it all right if
I call you Mr. F?


694
00:34:51.007 --> 00:34:53.674
Uh, Edward is fine.

695
00:34:53.715 --> 00:34:54.590
Thank you.

696
00:34:54.632 --> 00:34:56.049
Oh, all right, then.

697
00:34:56.091 --> 00:34:58.465
Edward comes from a
prominent family in London.


698
00:34:58.507 --> 00:35:01.258
His stepmother expects
great things from him.


699
00:35:01.299 --> 00:35:01.882
Is that so?

700
00:35:01.924 --> 00:35:02.966
Tell me, Edward.

701
00:35:03.007 --> 00:35:05.216
What are your ambitions?

702
00:35:05.258 --> 00:35:06.799
Oh.

703
00:35:06.841 --> 00:35:09.799
My brother Robert is the
ambitious one in the family.


704
00:35:09.841 --> 00:35:11.799
I have no wish to
be distinguished,


705
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:14.049
nor any idea I ever shall be.

706
00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:17.049
I only wish to be
perfectly happy.


707
00:35:17.091 --> 00:35:18.924
Wealth plays no part in it.

708
00:35:18.966 --> 00:35:20.299
Nor should it.

709
00:35:20.341 --> 00:35:21.632
Money can only bring
happiness when there


710
00:35:21.674 --> 00:35:23.007
is nothing else to give it.

711
00:35:23.049 --> 00:35:25.216
Well, as the one who
handles our budget,


712
00:35:25.258 --> 00:35:27.049
I can certainly
say a little wealth


713
00:35:27.091 --> 00:35:30.174
would increase my happiness.

714
00:35:30.216 --> 00:35:33.674
Well then, if not fame and
fortune, what would grant you


715
00:35:33.715 --> 00:35:35.799
this great happiness, Edward?

716
00:35:41.549 --> 00:35:42.465
I wish I could say.

717
00:35:50.549 --> 00:35:53.507
You are extraordinarily
talented.


718
00:35:53.549 --> 00:35:54.632
I wish that were true.

719
00:35:54.674 --> 00:35:55.632
It is.

720
00:35:55.674 --> 00:35:57.174
Do not sell yourself short.

721
00:36:04.299 --> 00:36:10.924
Elinor, I'm sorry if I've
seemed reserved during my visit.


722
00:36:10.966 --> 00:36:11.882
You need not apologize.

723
00:36:11.924 --> 00:36:14.133
No, I do need to.

724
00:36:14.174 --> 00:36:16.007
I may not be the best
counselor in all things,


725
00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:17.966
but if talking about it--

726
00:36:18.007 --> 00:36:21.174
No, that's-- that's
just the thing.


727
00:36:21.216 --> 00:36:24.757
I gave my word I would
not speak of it to anyone.


728
00:36:24.799 --> 00:36:28.007
And I-
- I--

729
00:36:28.049 --> 00:36:29.341
Your horse is ready, sir.

730
00:36:32.258 --> 00:36:33.799
Thank you.

731
00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:44.674
Are you sure you
can't stay any longer?


732
00:36:44.716 --> 00:36:46.216
I'm afraid not.

733
00:36:46.258 --> 00:36:48.632
I've been away from
London too long as it is.


734
00:36:48.674 --> 00:36:51.674
Been lovely seeing
you all again.


735
00:36:51.716 --> 00:36:52.549
Edward.

736
00:36:56.008 --> 00:36:58.757
If these things you cannot
speak of become speakable,


737
00:36:58.799 --> 00:37:00.966
you'll always have my ear.

738
00:37:01.008 --> 00:37:06.008
Your friendship might be the
greatest blessing I've known.


739
00:37:06.049 --> 00:37:09.133
And now I must bid you farewell.

740
00:37:20.216 --> 00:37:22.091
What is it about
us that sends all


741
00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:24.216
of the men in our lives riding
off to London in such haste?


742
00:37:27.174 --> 00:37:28.799
Ah,
you're here at last.


743
00:37:28.841 --> 00:37:30.465
I apologize for our tardiness.

744
00:37:30.507 --> 00:37:31.632
Was is it Thomas?

745
00:37:31.674 --> 00:37:33.258
Did he take the
wrong turn again?


746
00:37:33.299 --> 00:37:35.008
We should never have let him
graduate from those pigs.


747
00:37:35.049 --> 00:37:37.216
Now, allow me to present
the Miss Steeles.


748
00:37:37.258 --> 00:37:39.924
This is Anne and
her sister Lucy.


749
00:37:39.966 --> 00:37:42.507
We met them in town
yesterday, and it turns out


750
00:37:42.549 --> 00:37:44.799
that we are distant cousins.

751
00:37:44.841 --> 00:37:46.882
What a small world we live in.

752
00:37:46.924 --> 00:37:48.924
And they may just
be the sweetest girls


753
00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:50.258
in that little small world.

754
00:37:50.299 --> 00:37:51.799
Oh.

755
00:37:51.841 --> 00:37:54.966
Sir John, you flatterer.

756
00:37:55.008 --> 00:37:57.799
And so anxious to meet
the Dashwood sisters.


757
00:37:57.841 --> 00:37:59.133
From the moment
you were mentioned,


758
00:37:59.174 --> 00:38:00.465
they've asked of nothing else.

759
00:38:00.507 --> 00:38:02.091
We simply had to meet you.

760
00:38:02.133 --> 00:38:04.757
There's almost never
anyone new in the area.


761
00:38:04.799 --> 00:38:06.133
Do you find it dull here?

762
00:38:06.174 --> 00:38:09.757
Sir John is such a
gracious host, isn't he?


763
00:38:09.799 --> 00:38:11.757
Barton Park is so lovely.

764
00:38:11.799 --> 00:38:13.049
I wonder how many rooms it has?

765
00:38:13.091 --> 00:38:15.174
Can you imagine
how many servants?


766
00:38:15.216 --> 00:38:17.424
The most servants I've
ever seen was at a dinner


767
00:38:17.465 --> 00:38:19.091
of my distant cousins.

768
00:38:19.133 --> 00:38:22.008
I was sat next to a ghastly
woman, who was chewing her food


769
00:38:22.049 --> 00:38:26.924
so loudly, it was as if she
had no breeding whatsoever.


770
00:38:26.966 --> 00:38:28.549
But he was so
dim-witted, I could


771
00:38:28.591 --> 00:38:32.091
barely stand to be around him.

772
00:38:32.133 --> 00:38:34.841
Not like your beau,
Miss Marianne.


773
00:38:34.882 --> 00:38:38.882
You must tell us how you
managed to tame Mr. Willoughby.


774
00:38:38.924 --> 00:38:42.549
There are rumors the two of
you are engaged to marry.


775
00:38:42.591 --> 00:38:44.382
Are they true?

776
00:38:44.424 --> 00:38:45.757
No.

777
00:38:45.799 --> 00:38:47.549
I wonder where those
rumors came from?


778
00:38:47.591 --> 00:38:48.924
And what of you, Elinor?

779
00:38:48.966 --> 00:38:50.757
Surely, there's an
army of Devonshire men


780
00:38:50.799 --> 00:38:52.465
vying for your affection.

781
00:38:52.507 --> 00:38:55.465
Well, you've hit upon a great
secret there, Miss Steele.


782
00:38:55.507 --> 00:38:58.966
Miss Elinor's heart is
claimed by a mystery suitor.


783
00:38:59.008 --> 00:39:02.549
Now, we don't know who it could
be, although Barton Cottage did


784
00:39:02.591 --> 00:39:05.674
receive a recent
visit by one Mr. F.


785
00:39:05.716 --> 00:39:07.465
Edward Ferrars.

786
00:39:07.507 --> 00:39:08.549
Oh.

787
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:10.382
We know Mr. Ferrars very well.

788
00:39:10.424 --> 00:39:11.465
But surely--

789
00:39:11.507 --> 00:39:12.757
Anne, stop.

790
00:39:12.799 --> 00:39:14.757
We can hardly claim
to know him well.


791
00:39:14.799 --> 00:39:17.133
We've met him once or twice.

792
00:39:17.174 --> 00:39:18.716
Our uncle was his schoolmaster.

793
00:39:18.757 --> 00:39:20.465
Oh.

794
00:39:20.507 --> 00:39:22.716
I'm afraid Mrs. Jennings and
Sir John are just teasing you.


795
00:39:22.757 --> 00:39:24.299
You see, Edward's
stepsister, Fanny,


796
00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.966
is married to our
half-brother, John,


797
00:39:26.008 --> 00:39:27.299
and that's why he visited us.

798
00:39:29.841 --> 00:39:31.549
Oh, bother.

799
00:39:31.591 --> 00:39:32.966
I was so sure.

800
00:39:49.799 --> 00:39:50.591
Thank you.

801
00:39:58.841 --> 00:40:00.799
It seems as though
I've won again.


802
00:40:00.841 --> 00:40:02.841
Should we play another hand?

803
00:40:02.883 --> 00:40:06.424
I must say, Marianne
plays beautifully.


804
00:40:06.465 --> 00:40:09.674
I'm hopeless when it comes to
the piano or any instrument


805
00:40:09.716 --> 00:40:10.757
really.

806
00:40:10.799 --> 00:40:12.507
Excuse me.

807
00:40:12.549 --> 00:40:16.132
I do wish I had some talent.

808
00:40:16.174 --> 00:40:18.174
Miss Dashwood,
could I possibly


809
00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:19.507
borrow a moment of your time?

810
00:40:19.549 --> 00:40:20.507
Yes.

811
00:40:20.549 --> 00:40:23.716
Yes, of course, please.

812
00:40:23.757 --> 00:40:26.466
I simply must
apologize for my sister.


813
00:40:26.507 --> 00:40:30.799
She speaks incessantly, even
when she has nothing to say.


814
00:40:30.841 --> 00:40:32.674
Then she should get
along splendidly with Mrs.


815
00:40:32.716 --> 00:40:33.924
Jennings and Sir John.

816
00:40:39.132 --> 00:40:41.632
I was wondering,
since your brother is


817
00:40:41.674 --> 00:40:43.966
married into the
Ferrars family, perhaps


818
00:40:44.008 --> 00:40:46.174
you could do me a small favor.

819
00:40:46.215 --> 00:40:48.008
You see, I would very
much like an introduction


820
00:40:48.049 --> 00:40:49.841
to Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars.

821
00:40:49.883 --> 00:40:54.008
It's very important that
I win their approval.


822
00:40:54.049 --> 00:40:56.924
Oh, well, I've never
met Mrs. Ferrars,


823
00:40:56.966 --> 00:40:59.174
and I don't think
I'd be much help


824
00:40:59.215 --> 00:41:02.008
in gaining Fanny's affections.

825
00:41:02.049 --> 00:41:03.924
I see.

826
00:41:03.966 --> 00:41:06.049
How unfortunate.

827
00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.924
Why, if I may ask, is
it so important to you?


828
00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:10.924
Oh, perhaps I shouldn't say.

829
00:41:13.799 --> 00:41:15.883
Very well.

830
00:41:15.924 --> 00:41:18.382
I need them to like
me, because one day--


831
00:41:18.424 --> 00:41:20.340
hopefully one day soon--

832
00:41:20.382 --> 00:41:22.841
we'll be rather
intimately acquainted.


833
00:41:26.841 --> 00:41:29.382
I'm engaged to enter
into the family.


834
00:41:29.424 --> 00:41:30.841
Oh.

835
00:41:30.883 --> 00:41:34.382
To Fanny and Edward's
brother, Robert?


836
00:41:34.424 --> 00:41:35.549
I didn't know that he was--

837
00:41:35.591 --> 00:41:37.924
No, not Robert.

838
00:41:37.966 --> 00:41:41.090
I've never met him
before in my life.


839
00:41:41.132 --> 00:41:42.257
To Edward.

840
00:41:47.591 --> 00:41:50.799
You and-- you and Ed--

841
00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:54.132
Ed-
- Edward Ferrars are engaged?

842
00:41:54.174 --> 00:41:56.716
I know it must come
as a great surprise.


843
00:41:56.758 --> 00:41:58.466
You see, it's a secret
only known to Edward,


844
00:41:58.507 --> 00:42:00.049
myself, and my sister.

845
00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.632
And we've been keeping
it these past four years.


846
00:42:02.674 --> 00:42:04.966
Four years?

847
00:42:05.008 --> 00:42:06.466
Yes.

848
00:42:06.507 --> 00:42:08.632
He asked for my hand the
day before he finished


849
00:42:08.674 --> 00:42:11.257
his schooling under my uncle.

850
00:42:11.299 --> 00:42:14.132
Actually, he visited my
uncle quite recently,


851
00:42:14.174 --> 00:42:17.132
I'm assuming around the same
time he came to visit you.


852
00:42:17.174 --> 00:42:19.799
I was only able to
see him once, but--


853
00:42:19.841 --> 00:42:21.966
but I gave him a ring.

854
00:42:22.007 --> 00:42:28.132
Nothing fancy, of course,
just a promise of my love.


855
00:42:28.174 --> 00:42:29.632
Tell me, Elinor.

856
00:42:29.674 --> 00:42:33.674
When you saw him,
was he wearing it?


857
00:42:37.716 --> 00:42:38.549
He was.

858
00:42:44.341 --> 00:42:48.299
Now, Miss Dashwood, promise
me that you'll keep our secret.


859
00:42:48.341 --> 00:42:50.883
Edward has told me about his
stepmother and her rather


860
00:42:50.924 --> 00:42:52.591
old-fashioned views.

861
00:42:52.632 --> 00:42:54.632
And I know it's going to be
difficult to win her approval


862
00:42:54.674 --> 00:42:56.341
without fortune, as I am.

863
00:42:56.382 --> 00:42:58.883
But I really must win
her over before she


864
00:42:58.924 --> 00:43:00.799
learns of our engagement.

865
00:43:00.841 --> 00:43:02.341
Will you promise, Elinor?

866
00:43:02.382 --> 00:43:04.507
Will you promise not
to tell another soul?


867
00:43:07.466 --> 00:43:11.507
Well, um, I certainly
didn't seek your confidence


868
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:12.965
in this matter, Miss Steele.

869
00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:16.799
But your secret is safe with me.

870
00:43:16.841 --> 00:43:18.132
I thank you.

871
00:43:18.174 --> 00:43:19.633
I look forward to
you and I becoming


872
00:43:19.674 --> 00:43:23.965
the very best of friends.

873
00:43:24.007 --> 00:43:28.466
I think it best we
return to our hosts.


874
00:43:28.507 --> 00:43:29.424
Oh, yes.

875
00:43:29.466 --> 00:43:31.007
Of course.

876
00:43:31.049 --> 00:43:32.549
Lest they wonder what it is
that we're going on about.


877
00:43:52.633 --> 00:43:54.841
Elinor, can
you come down here, please?


878
00:43:54.883 --> 00:43:56.007
Just a moment, Mother.

879
00:43:59.799 --> 00:44:01.174
Yes.

880
00:44:01.215 --> 00:44:03.924
Mrs. Jennings, what
brings you here today?


881
00:44:03.965 --> 00:44:06.257
As if I need a reason.

882
00:44:06.299 --> 00:44:09.466
But as it happens, I
come with an invitation.


883
00:44:09.507 --> 00:44:12.799
It has been far too long since I
have been to the home in London


884
00:44:12.841 --> 00:44:14.799
that I shared with
my late husband.


885
00:44:14.841 --> 00:44:17.799
So I have decided
to winter there,


886
00:44:17.841 --> 00:44:21.299
and I would love you and the
Steele sisters to accompany me.


887
00:44:21.341 --> 00:44:21.924
To London?

888
00:44:21.965 --> 00:44:25.007
Yes.

889
00:44:25.049 --> 00:44:27.965
Oh, Mrs. Jennings,
that's so generous of you,


890
00:44:28.007 --> 00:44:29.299
but we couldn't possibly go--

891
00:44:29.341 --> 00:44:30.716
Yes, we can.

892
00:44:30.758 --> 00:44:34.965
Elinor, Willoughby will be
in London and so will Ed--


893
00:44:35.007 --> 00:44:37.882
other friends, I'm sure.

894
00:44:37.924 --> 00:44:39.132
Go, dear.

895
00:44:39.174 --> 00:44:40.633
It'll be good for you.

896
00:44:40.674 --> 00:44:42.007
Then it's settled.

897
00:44:42.049 --> 00:44:43.466
I'm going to pack.

898
00:44:43.507 --> 00:44:45.466
Lovely.

899
00:44:45.507 --> 00:44:46.466
Oh, it'll be delightful.

900
00:44:46.507 --> 00:44:47.965
Have a wonderful time.

901
00:44:48.007 --> 00:44:49.674
I'll buy
them some proper clothes.


902
00:45:01.341 --> 00:45:02.799
Oh, my.

903
00:45:02.841 --> 00:45:04.132
This is lovely.

904
00:45:04.174 --> 00:45:06.508
I wonder how many
servants they have?


905
00:45:06.549 --> 00:45:08.840
Please show the girls
to their apartments.


906
00:45:08.882 --> 00:45:09.799
Come on.

907
00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.965
Don't keep them waiting.

908
00:45:12.007 --> 00:45:12.840
For the post.

909
00:45:12.882 --> 00:45:13.965
Thank you.

910
00:45:14.007 --> 00:45:15.216
I love it here.

911
00:45:15.257 --> 00:45:16.799
I think that I
shall never leave.


912
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:19.466
Isn't this exciting?

913
00:45:19.508 --> 00:45:21.424
Marianne.

914
00:45:21.466 --> 00:45:23.216
Is that letter addressed
to Mr. Willoughby?


915
00:45:23.257 --> 00:45:24.965
He'll want to
know I'm in town.


916
00:45:25.007 --> 00:45:28.132
Marianne, we've
only just arrived.


917
00:45:28.174 --> 00:45:29.758
I don't think it
proper for you--


918
00:45:29.799 --> 00:45:32.382
Who cares for propriety when
it comes to the man I love?


919
00:45:32.424 --> 00:45:34.049
You may prefer for
the things that you


920
00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:35.924
want to come to you,
Elinor, but I choose


921
00:45:35.965 --> 00:45:37.799
to walk a different path.

922
00:45:42.633 --> 00:45:44.840
The Steele sisters
certainly like sleeping in,


923
00:45:44.882 --> 00:45:47.591
not that I'm
complaining, mind you.


924
00:45:47.633 --> 00:45:51.216
I swear, that Anne
never stops, does she?


925
00:45:51.257 --> 00:45:58.257
Some people just go on, and on,
and on, and on, and on, and on.


926
00:45:58.299 --> 00:46:00.716
Is there anything for me?

927
00:46:00.758 --> 00:46:02.508
Oh, I'm afraid not, dear.

928
00:46:05.132 --> 00:46:06.633
We've been here
for three days.


929
00:46:06.674 --> 00:46:07.965
I've already sent two letters.

930
00:46:08.007 --> 00:46:10.132
Why won't he visit, or
at least write back?


931
00:46:10.174 --> 00:46:11.633
He may not be in town.

932
00:46:11.674 --> 00:46:13.132
You know he loves to hunt.

933
00:46:13.174 --> 00:46:14.882
I'm sure he hasn't
received your letters yet.


934
00:46:14.924 --> 00:46:16.466
Perhaps this will
lift your spirits.


935
00:46:16.508 --> 00:46:19.341
It seems that we have all
been invited to an assembly


936
00:46:19.382 --> 00:46:20.508
next week.

937
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:21.716
Will Willoughby be there?

938
00:46:21.758 --> 00:46:23.382
I'm certain he's been invited.

939
00:46:23.424 --> 00:46:25.882
His aunt is a woman
of great renown.


940
00:46:25.924 --> 00:46:28.882
Oh, this should be
quite the party.


941
00:46:28.924 --> 00:46:30.174
I'm not sure
that I have a gown


942
00:46:30.216 --> 00:46:31.633
appropriate for such an event.

943
00:46:31.674 --> 00:46:34.591
Ah, well then, that sounds
like the perfect excuse


944
00:46:34.633 --> 00:46:35.674
to go shopping.

945
00:46:35.716 --> 00:46:37.299
Yes.

946
00:46:48.674 --> 00:46:51.757
Goodness, how enchanting.

947
00:46:51.799 --> 00:46:53.132
Yes.

948
00:46:53.174 --> 00:46:56.216
Well, I must make
the rounds and greet


949
00:46:56.257 --> 00:46:58.965
all those dusty old
codgers, whose company I've


950
00:46:59.007 --> 00:47:01.216
been avoiding all these years.

951
00:47:01.257 --> 00:47:05.132
I shall spare you
girls the agony.


952
00:47:05.174 --> 00:47:08.007
Barrington, how lovely
to see you again.


953
00:47:08.049 --> 00:47:11.965
I think I'll find
someone to dance with.


954
00:47:12.007 --> 00:47:15.007
I don't see
Willoughby anywhere.


955
00:47:15.049 --> 00:47:16.799
I'm going to find
somewhere to sit.


956
00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.257
These enormous heels are agony.

957
00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:23.965
Elinor, I must say,
I'm grateful we're


958
00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:26.007
able to have a moment alone.

959
00:47:26.049 --> 00:47:28.341
I've been rather worried
since our talk at Barton Park.


960
00:47:28.383 --> 00:47:30.257
I've said nothing
of your secret.


961
00:47:30.299 --> 00:47:32.216
It seems to me
that our conversation


962
00:47:32.257 --> 00:47:34.424
may have upset you somewhat.

963
00:47:34.466 --> 00:47:38.174
Well, Miss Steele, that
is simply not the case.


964
00:47:38.216 --> 00:47:40.466
Truly?

965
00:47:40.508 --> 00:47:42.049
My goodness, Elinor.

966
00:47:42.091 --> 00:47:44.091
John, what a surprise.

967
00:47:44.132 --> 00:47:45.591
I didn't know you
were in London.


968
00:47:45.633 --> 00:47:47.299
I was just
about to say the same thing.


969
00:47:47.341 --> 00:47:49.299
I never would have expected
to run into you here


970
00:47:49.341 --> 00:47:52.466
of all places, not that
an event such as this


971
00:47:52.508 --> 00:47:55.549
is above your station or
that you'd be unwelcome here.


972
00:47:55.591 --> 00:47:57.091
In fact, I think that you--

973
00:47:57.132 --> 00:47:59.799
Allow me to introduce
Ms. Lucy Steele.


974
00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.383
Hello, Miss Steele.

975
00:48:01.424 --> 00:48:03.132
I'm John Dashwood.

976
00:48:03.174 --> 00:48:07.007
This is my wife, Fanny, and her
stepbrother, Robert Ferrars.


977
00:48:07.049 --> 00:48:08.007
My pleasure.

978
00:48:11.007 --> 00:48:12.424
How do you do, Miss Steele?

979
00:48:12.466 --> 00:48:13.299
Oh.

980
00:48:13.341 --> 00:48:14.965
Miss Dashwood.

981
00:48:15.007 --> 00:48:16.383
Lovely to meet you both.

982
00:48:16.424 --> 00:48:18.466
Tell me, is your
brother, Edward, here, too?


983
00:48:18.508 --> 00:48:19.091
Edward?

984
00:48:19.132 --> 00:48:19.965
Yes.

985
00:48:20.007 --> 00:48:21.257
Heavens no.

986
00:48:21.299 --> 00:48:24.007
No, he shuns events
such as these.


987
00:48:24.049 --> 00:48:26.174
However, he will be
disappointed indeed


988
00:48:26.216 --> 00:48:27.591
when I tell him you were here.

989
00:48:27.633 --> 00:48:30.466
He speaks of you incessantly.

990
00:48:30.508 --> 00:48:33.549
"Miss Dashwood this,
Miss Dashwood that."


991
00:48:33.591 --> 00:48:36.341
I think we should invite
these lovely ladies to dinner.


992
00:48:36.383 --> 00:48:38.091
I'd love to get to
know you both better.


993
00:48:38.132 --> 00:48:40.216
Robert, now is not the time.

994
00:48:40.257 --> 00:48:42.049
It's a wonderful idea.

995
00:48:42.091 --> 00:48:43.799
Let's arrange it.

996
00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:46.591
Elinor, I'm sure you have a busy
schedule full of appointments,


997
00:48:46.632 --> 00:48:49.674
but you must promise to come.

998
00:48:49.715 --> 00:48:50.924
Of course, John.

999
00:48:50.966 --> 00:48:53.924
And I always keep my promises.

1000
00:48:53.966 --> 00:48:55.757
Please excuse me.

1001
00:49:08.715 --> 00:49:11.799
Colonel Brandon,
pleasant surprise.


1002
00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:13.549
I must apologize for
my abrupt departure


1003
00:49:13.591 --> 00:49:14.674
when last we saw each other.

1004
00:49:14.715 --> 00:49:16.132
That's not necessary.

1005
00:49:16.174 --> 00:49:19.508
Was your urgent business
resolved happily?


1006
00:49:19.549 --> 00:49:21.258
Not just yet, I'm afraid.

1007
00:49:21.299 --> 00:49:23.299
Miss Dashwood, I'm very
glad I ran into you.


1008
00:49:23.341 --> 00:49:26.091
I was wondering if you could
clear something up for me?


1009
00:49:26.132 --> 00:49:28.799
I heard a rumor that
Marianne is engaged


1010
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:30.632
to marry John Willoughby.

1011
00:49:30.674 --> 00:49:34.299
Well, with Mrs. Jennings and
the Steele sisters in town,


1012
00:49:34.341 --> 00:49:37.049
I suspect half of London
has heard that rumor.


1013
00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:38.924
As far as I know,
they are not engaged.


1014
00:49:38.966 --> 00:49:41.299
But I don't want to
give you false hope.


1015
00:49:41.341 --> 00:49:44.799
I'm certain they are
very fond of each other.


1016
00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:45.966
I see.

1017
00:49:46.007 --> 00:49:48.424
Well then, to your
sister, I wish


1018
00:49:48.466 --> 00:49:53.091
all the imaginable happiness,
and to Willoughby, that he


1019
00:49:53.132 --> 00:49:55.799
may endeavor to deserve her.

1020
00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.924
Good evening.

1021
00:50:12.632 --> 00:50:14.799
You look as joyful as I feel.

1022
00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:15.674
I wish we hadn't come.

1023
00:50:15.715 --> 00:50:16.674
Yes.

1024
00:50:16.715 --> 00:50:17.508
Well, I'm afraid that--

1025
00:50:20.341 --> 00:50:21.632
What?

1026
00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.049
Willoughby.

1027
00:50:31.091 --> 00:50:32.132
Elinor, he's here.

1028
00:50:47.132 --> 00:50:50.299
Marianne, I beg of you.

1029
00:50:50.341 --> 00:50:52.007
Please don't--

1030
00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:53.258
Willoughby?

1031
00:50:58.966 --> 00:51:02.049
Miss
Dashwood, Marianne.


1032
00:51:02.091 --> 00:51:03.507
Will you not take my hand?

1033
00:51:03.549 --> 00:51:04.341
Of course.

1034
00:51:09.007 --> 00:51:10.799
What is the meaning of this?

1035
00:51:10.841 --> 00:51:12.632
Have you not
received my letters?


1036
00:51:12.674 --> 00:51:16.299
I did receive your letters,
and I thank you for letting


1037
00:51:16.341 --> 00:51:17.799
me know you were in London.

1038
00:51:17.841 --> 00:51:20.466
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1039
00:51:26.966 --> 00:51:27.882
Elinor, bring him back.

1040
00:51:27.924 --> 00:51:29.091
No.

1041
00:51:29.133 --> 00:51:30.841
Make him come
back this instant.


1042
00:51:30.882 --> 00:51:32.465
It's all right.

1043
00:51:32.507 --> 00:51:34.133
I feel--

1044
00:51:34.174 --> 00:51:34.841
No.

1045
00:51:34.882 --> 00:51:35.632
I feel--

1046
00:51:35.674 --> 00:51:37.133
No, no.

1047
00:51:37.174 --> 00:51:38.507
Let's take her outside.
I will take you home.


1048
00:52:03.258 --> 00:52:04.216
Marianne?

1049
00:52:07.049 --> 00:52:11.174
Marianne, talk to me.

1050
00:52:11.216 --> 00:52:12.590
Willoughby finally
wrote me back.


1051
00:52:14.757 --> 00:52:16.632
JOHN WILLOUGHBY
"My dear madam,


1052
00:52:16.674 --> 00:52:19.216
I shall always reflect
on my former acquaintance


1053
00:52:19.258 --> 00:52:21.841
with your family with pleasure,
but my affections have


1054
00:52:21.882 --> 00:52:23.507
been long engaged elsewhere.

1055
00:52:23.549 --> 00:52:26.465
And it is with great regret
that I return your handkerchief.


1056
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:33.590
Your most obedient, humble
servant, John Willoughby."


1057
00:52:33.632 --> 00:52:35.841
"John Willoughby."

1058
00:52:35.882 --> 00:52:37.007
Oh.

1059
00:52:37.049 --> 00:52:38.383
Oh, Marianne.

1060
00:52:38.424 --> 00:52:41.465
What a deceitful,
dishonorable, cruel man.


1061
00:52:41.507 --> 00:52:42.882
He's not.

1062
00:52:42.924 --> 00:52:45.549
This cannot be how
he truly feels.


1063
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:46.590
He loves me.

1064
00:52:46.632 --> 00:52:47.382
Marianne.

1065
00:52:52.216 --> 00:52:55.424
Do you want me to send
word to the Ferrars,


1066
00:52:55.465 --> 00:52:57.924
let them know that tonight's not
a good night to go to dinner?


1067
00:52:57.966 --> 00:53:00.674
Is that tonight?

1068
00:53:00.716 --> 00:53:02.258
No.

1069
00:53:02.299 --> 00:53:04.549
No, we must go.

1070
00:53:04.590 --> 00:53:06.174
I will not let
John and especially


1071
00:53:06.216 --> 00:53:08.133
Fanny know that I'm upset.

1072
00:53:08.174 --> 00:53:09.841
I will not give them
the satisfaction.


1073
00:53:15.716 --> 00:53:19.091
Mrs. Ferrars, I simply must
say thank you for allowing


1074
00:53:19.133 --> 00:53:20.299
us to dine with you.

1075
00:53:20.341 --> 00:53:24.382
And, Fanny, the most
perfect hostess.


1076
00:53:24.424 --> 00:53:27.299
I think you should take Lucy
here under your wing, Fanny.


1077
00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:28.924
Perhaps we should
even invite the Steele


1078
00:53:28.966 --> 00:53:30.299
sisters to stay with us.

1079
00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:31.882
Oh, Lucy and Anne

1080
00:53:31.924 --> 00:53:33.340
are guests of Mrs. Jennings.

1081
00:53:33.382 --> 00:53:35.882
It would be rude of us to
ask them to abandon her.


1082
00:53:35.924 --> 00:53:38.465
Although, we
would certainly miss


1083
00:53:38.507 --> 00:53:40.757
Anne's delightful witticisms.

1084
00:53:40.799 --> 00:53:44.841
But I suppose we could
do without her for a day


1085
00:53:44.882 --> 00:53:48.465
or two, perhaps a week.

1086
00:53:48.507 --> 00:53:49.757
There.

1087
00:53:49.799 --> 00:53:53.382
It's settled, then.

1088
00:53:53.424 --> 00:53:56.174
It's a shame Edward
couldn't join us tonight.


1089
00:53:56.216 --> 00:53:58.008
He's such a nice boy.

1090
00:53:58.049 --> 00:54:00.258
Yes, I thought he'd be here.

1091
00:54:00.299 --> 00:54:02.091
Did you tell him Miss
Dashwood was coming?


1092
00:54:02.133 --> 00:54:04.757
Can't imagine him
refusing if he knew.


1093
00:54:04.799 --> 00:54:07.882
I told you, Elinor, he's
quite taken with you.


1094
00:54:07.924 --> 00:54:10.507
Edward could not
join us because he


1095
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:12.924
is currently staying
with the Mortons,


1096
00:54:12.966 --> 00:54:15.340
a family of great esteem.

1097
00:54:15.382 --> 00:54:19.174
Edward will likely soon be
engaged to young Miss Morton,


1098
00:54:19.216 --> 00:54:23.924
an exceptional woman,
with a 30,000-pound dowry.


1099
00:54:23.966 --> 00:54:29.049
Whatever youthful dalliances
Edward may have indulged in,


1100
00:54:29.091 --> 00:54:34.174
he has always been destined
to marry someone of status.


1101
00:54:34.216 --> 00:54:37.340
In spite of how he likes
to portray himself,


1102
00:54:37.382 --> 00:54:40.008
Edward knows his
place and would never


1103
00:54:40.049 --> 00:54:43.841
be with someone beneath him.

1104
00:54:43.882 --> 00:54:45.216
I can't stand it.

1105
00:54:45.258 --> 00:54:46.757
Mrs. Ferrars, you
are without a doubt


1106
00:54:46.799 --> 00:54:50.091
the most miserable woman I
have ever met in my life.


1107
00:54:50.133 --> 00:54:52.716
Elinor, don't let her
make you miserable, too.


1108
00:55:01.716 --> 00:55:04.008
Miss Dashwood,
Colonel Brandon.


1109
00:55:04.049 --> 00:55:08.008
Oh, Colonel Brandon.

1110
00:55:08.049 --> 00:55:10.424
Thank you for your
assistance at the ball.


1111
00:55:10.465 --> 00:55:12.133
I know Marianne would
want to thank you,


1112
00:55:12.174 --> 00:55:13.299
too, but I'm afraid she's--

1113
00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:15.882
It is you I wish
to speak with.


1114
00:55:15.924 --> 00:55:16.924
Oh, please.

1115
00:55:21.841 --> 00:55:24.340
I do not know if coming here
was the right thing to do,


1116
00:55:24.382 --> 00:55:28.465
but I have information that
may be useful to your sister.


1117
00:55:28.507 --> 00:55:30.757
Do you remember,
back at Barton Park,


1118
00:55:30.799 --> 00:55:33.174
I told you I once knew a
girl very much like Marianne?


1119
00:55:33.215 --> 00:55:34.340
Yes, I remember.

1120
00:55:34.382 --> 00:55:36.424
Her name was Eliza.

1121
00:55:36.465 --> 00:55:39.299
And she was a ward of my family.

1122
00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:42.924
The two of us fell
deeply in love.


1123
00:55:42.966 --> 00:55:45.215
My father, however,
did not approve,


1124
00:55:45.257 --> 00:55:48.382
but he and I came
to an agreement,


1125
00:55:48.424 --> 00:55:50.091
or so I was led to believe.

1126
00:55:50.133 --> 00:55:53.174
If I were to distinguish
myself in the military,


1127
00:55:53.215 --> 00:55:55.049
he would put aside
his objections


1128
00:55:55.091 --> 00:55:57.091
and allow us to marry.

1129
00:55:57.133 --> 00:56:00.382
So I enlisted, fighting
not only for my country


1130
00:56:00.424 --> 00:56:02.883
but for the woman I loved.

1131
00:56:02.924 --> 00:56:08.133
I held up my end of the bargain,
but when I returned to England,


1132
00:56:08.174 --> 00:56:11.424
I learned that my father
had cast Eliza out.


1133
00:56:11.465 --> 00:56:14.632
It took years, but I
found her, penniless


1134
00:56:14.674 --> 00:56:17.757
and dying of consumption
in a pauper's hospital.


1135
00:56:17.799 --> 00:56:21.257
She had a daughter.

1136
00:56:21.299 --> 00:56:25.674
When Eliza passed, I took
the girl in as my ward.


1137
00:56:25.716 --> 00:56:27.340
Once she'd reached
a proper age, I sent


1138
00:56:27.382 --> 00:56:29.008
her to school here in London.

1139
00:56:29.049 --> 00:56:32.340
But a year ago,
she went missing.


1140
00:56:32.382 --> 00:56:34.507
No one knew what
had become of her.


1141
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:36.674
The letter I received
the day of the picnic


1142
00:56:36.716 --> 00:56:41.591
told me that she had been
found, and she was with child.


1143
00:56:41.632 --> 00:56:44.382
It took some convincing,
but eventually


1144
00:56:44.424 --> 00:56:47.008
she told me the man's name.

1145
00:56:47.049 --> 00:56:48.549
You can likely guess it.

1146
00:56:51.049 --> 00:56:53.549
Willoughby?

1147
00:56:53.591 --> 00:56:55.008
Oh.

1148
00:56:55.049 --> 00:56:57.466
Oh.

1149
00:56:57.507 --> 00:56:59.841
I apologize if this
knowledge is a burden,


1150
00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:02.799
but you will know better
than I what, if any of it,


1151
00:57:02.841 --> 00:57:05.091
may be useful to Marianne.

1152
00:57:05.132 --> 00:57:07.049
Good day.

1153
00:57:07.091 --> 00:57:09.466
Colonel.

1154
00:57:09.507 --> 00:57:13.008
You are truly an honorable man.

1155
00:57:24.716 --> 00:57:29.591
Elinor, I just had to
come and see my dear friend.


1156
00:57:29.632 --> 00:57:32.549
So your stay with the
Ferrars is going well?


1157
00:57:32.591 --> 00:57:36.174
Oh, quite well,
quite well indeed.


1158
00:57:36.215 --> 00:57:38.215
Fanny's grown very fond of me.

1159
00:57:38.257 --> 00:57:42.340
And Robert, he's-- well,
he's just so charming.


1160
00:57:42.382 --> 00:57:44.507
As for Mrs. Ferrars,
she's certainly


1161
00:57:44.549 --> 00:57:47.299
very protective of
her stepsons, but I


1162
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:50.215
believe she's warming to me.

1163
00:57:50.257 --> 00:57:54.008
What of Miss Morton, she
of the 30,000-pound dowry?


1164
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:55.632
Yes.

1165
00:57:55.674 --> 00:57:58.340
Well, I'm sure Edward is
making her believe he's going


1166
00:57:58.382 --> 00:58:00.257
to marry this Miss Morton.

1167
00:58:00.299 --> 00:58:02.883
It'll never happen.

1168
00:58:02.924 --> 00:58:04.424
If only you could
see us together,


1169
00:58:04.466 --> 00:58:07.299
Elinor, you would know
he's not capable of loving


1170
00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.799
anyone but me.

1171
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:16.132
Miss Dashwood.

1172
00:58:16.174 --> 00:58:17.507
Elinor, you must forgive me.

1173
00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:19.382
I fear you must think
I've been avoiding you.


1174
00:58:19.424 --> 00:58:20.049
But--

1175
00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:22.090
Mr. Ferrars, I--

1176
00:58:22.132 --> 00:58:24.549
I believe you know
Miss Lucy Steele.


1177
00:58:27.174 --> 00:58:29.841
Uh-
- I--

1178
00:58:29.883 --> 00:58:30.674
yes.

1179
00:58:35.215 --> 00:58:37.008
Yes, of course.

1180
00:58:37.049 --> 00:58:38.841
How do you do, Miss Steele?

1181
00:58:38.883 --> 00:58:40.299
Mr. Ferrars.

1182
00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:46.716
Well, isn't this a
lovely turn of events?


1183
00:58:46.758 --> 00:58:48.090
Yes, quite lovely.

1184
00:58:48.132 --> 00:58:48.924
Um--

1185
00:58:48.966 --> 00:58:49.799
Edward.

1186
00:58:49.841 --> 00:58:51.008
Yeah-- oh.

1187
00:58:51.049 --> 00:58:52.716
Miss Marianne, how
good to see you.


1188
00:58:52.758 --> 00:58:54.466
I knew you'd come.

1189
00:58:54.507 --> 00:58:56.382
You tried to stay away, but
you just can't seem to do it,


1190
00:58:56.424 --> 00:58:57.174
can you?

1191
00:58:57.215 --> 00:58:58.132
I wonder why that is?

1192
00:58:58.174 --> 00:58:59.341
Marianne.

1193
00:58:59.382 --> 00:59:01.257
Oh, I don't think
it's me, Elinor.


1194
00:59:01.299 --> 00:59:04.132
Let's just be honest with
our feelings for once.


1195
00:59:04.174 --> 00:59:06.966
You cherish honesty,
don't you, Edward?


1196
00:59:07.007 --> 00:59:09.257
Yes, I do, quite.

1197
00:59:09.299 --> 00:59:12.674
I also cherish punctuality,
which is why I must leave.


1198
00:59:12.716 --> 00:59:15.674
I am due to return
to my stepmother.


1199
00:59:15.716 --> 00:59:21.007
Oh, well, as I'm currently
staying at your stepmother's,


1200
00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:23.758
perhaps you could escort me.

1201
00:59:23.799 --> 00:59:26.132
You-- you are?

1202
00:59:26.174 --> 00:59:29.883
Well, isn't that just a--

1203
00:59:29.924 --> 00:59:31.549
yes, of course, 
I will take you.

1204
00:59:36.507 --> 00:59:38.299
Marianne.

1205
00:59:38.341 --> 00:59:41.382
Elinor, I-- I do hope I
shall see you again soon.


1206
00:59:45.549 --> 00:59:46.799
Elinor?

1207
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:57.674
The most beautiful
gown I'd seen in my life--


1208
00:59:57.716 --> 01:00:00.341
of course, we cannot afford
it, but my aunt said she


1209
01:00:00.382 --> 01:00:02.007
could make me one just like it.

1210
01:00:02.049 --> 01:00:04.799
Well, needless to
say, she wasn't quite


1211
01:00:04.841 --> 01:00:06.132
the modess she thought she was.

1212
01:00:08.215 --> 01:00:10.090
Edward, you've returned.

1213
01:00:10.132 --> 01:00:13.633
My dear brother-in-law, how
was your stay with the Mortons?


1214
01:00:13.674 --> 01:00:14.466
It was fine.

1215
01:00:14.507 --> 01:00:15.049
Thank you.

1216
01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:16.299
Fine?

1217
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:18.090
That's all you have to say?

1218
01:00:18.132 --> 01:00:21.341
They
were lovely hosts.


1219
01:00:21.382 --> 01:00:24.007
I visited Mrs.
Jennings' home to pay


1220
01:00:24.049 --> 01:00:25.382
my respects to the Dashwoods.

1221
01:00:25.424 --> 01:00:28.341
And who did I find
there but Miss Lucy


1222
01:00:28.382 --> 01:00:30.257
Steele, who informed
me that she has


1223
01:00:30.299 --> 01:00:33.132
been staying here in our home.

1224
01:00:33.174 --> 01:00:34.633
Imagine my surprise.

1225
01:00:34.674 --> 01:00:36.758
I'll wager you
hardly recognized her.


1226
01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:39.758
It's been so long since your
schooling under her uncle.


1227
01:00:39.799 --> 01:00:42.299
Oh, it hasn't been long
since we've seen him.


1228
01:00:42.341 --> 01:00:43.674
Edward visited us just--

1229
01:00:43.716 --> 01:00:45.090
Anne.

1230
01:00:45.132 --> 01:00:46.883
What do you mean?

1231
01:00:46.924 --> 01:00:51.132
When did Edward last visit you?

1232
01:00:51.174 --> 01:00:56.466
I-
- I-- that is--

1233
01:00:56.507 --> 01:00:58.049
I'm sorry.

1234
01:00:58.090 --> 01:00:59.758
What is she talking
about, Edward?


1235
01:00:59.799 --> 01:01:03.674
Well, I suppose this was
bound to come out at some point.


1236
01:01:06.216 --> 01:01:10.674
Lucy and I are engaged.

1237
01:01:10.716 --> 01:01:13.132
And we have been
these past four years.


1238
01:01:13.174 --> 01:01:15.424
Engaged?

1239
01:01:15.466 --> 01:01:19.965
You're engaged to this
peasant, and for four years?


1240
01:01:20.007 --> 01:01:20.799
I'm sorry.

1241
01:01:20.841 --> 01:01:21.674
I didn't mean--

1242
01:01:21.716 --> 01:01:23.382
Sorry?

1243
01:01:23.424 --> 01:01:25.507
You're sorry for keeping the
secret or for exposing it?


1244
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:28.049
We welcomed you into our home.

1245
01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:28.882
Fanny, please.

1246
01:01:28.924 --> 01:01:30.174
Oh, not a word.

1247
01:01:30.216 --> 01:01:32.674
You don't have one
ounce of sense.


1248
01:01:32.716 --> 01:01:36.466
You don't truly believe that
this girl loves you, do you?


1249
01:01:36.507 --> 01:01:38.132
She's only after your wealth.

1250
01:01:38.174 --> 01:01:39.049
I do love him.

1251
01:01:39.090 --> 01:01:41.090
Enough.

1252
01:01:41.132 --> 01:01:42.341
Fanny, sit.

1253
01:01:45.591 --> 01:01:48.758
This is greatly disappointing.

1254
01:01:48.799 --> 01:01:53.007
You two deceitful girls
will leave this instant.


1255
01:01:53.049 --> 01:01:54.799
Do not bother to
pack your things.


1256
01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:57.007
We will send them to
the Jennings' estate.


1257
01:01:57.049 --> 01:01:59.049
Or perhaps we shall burn them.

1258
01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.007
Stop it, both of you.

1259
01:02:01.049 --> 01:02:04.508
You fault these young ladies
for not being honest with you?


1260
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:07.840
Well, what choice
did you give them?


1261
01:02:07.882 --> 01:02:09.633
I beg your pardon?

1262
01:02:09.674 --> 01:02:15.674
Stepmother, Fanny, you make no
effort to conceal your feelings


1263
01:02:15.716 --> 01:02:19.090
towards those who do
not have our wealth,


1264
01:02:19.132 --> 01:02:20.758
wealth we did not
earn, by the way,


1265
01:02:20.799 --> 01:02:24.007
but which was handed to us.

1266
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:26.508
Can you not find
it in your hearts


1267
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:29.466
to judge people based
on their character


1268
01:02:29.508 --> 01:02:33.090
and not on the size of
their bank accounts?


1269
01:02:33.132 --> 01:02:35.508
If
you are finished,


1270
01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:39.049
allow me to explain
the state of things.


1271
01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:43.174
You will marry Miss Morton as
soon as it can be arranged,


1272
01:02:43.216 --> 01:02:46.341
and you will break
this ridiculous farce


1273
01:02:46.382 --> 01:02:48.508
of an engagement immediately.

1274
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:50.924
I will do neither
of those things.


1275
01:02:50.965 --> 01:02:52.341
Edward.

1276
01:02:52.382 --> 01:02:55.174
Four years ago, I gave
my word to Miss Steele,


1277
01:02:55.216 --> 01:02:56.716
and I will not break
it, not for you,


1278
01:02:56.758 --> 01:02:59.674
Fanny, not for you,
stepmother, not for--


1279
01:02:59.716 --> 01:03:00.466
not for anyone.

1280
01:03:03.716 --> 01:03:05.466
Very well.

1281
01:03:05.508 --> 01:03:08.674
You two shall be married.

1282
01:03:08.716 --> 01:03:12.299
And you, Edward,
shall be disinherited.


1283
01:03:12.341 --> 01:03:15.924
I will amend my will and
leave everything to Robert.


1284
01:03:15.965 --> 01:03:17.799
You will get nothing.

1285
01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.549
This I swear.

1286
01:03:20.591 --> 01:03:21.924
So be it.

1287
01:03:34.924 --> 01:03:39.049
Well, what are
you waiting for?


1288
01:03:50.674 --> 01:03:52.257
Mrs. Jennings is having
the carriage prepared.


1289
01:03:52.299 --> 01:03:54.508
The Steele sisters are
leaving immediately.


1290
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:58.924
Apparently, Lucy and Edward had
some sort of secret engagement.


1291
01:03:58.965 --> 01:04:01.299
These men, how
alike they all are,


1292
01:04:01.341 --> 01:04:05.007
keeping such secrets from the
women who truly love them.


1293
01:04:05.049 --> 01:04:06.591
Do you not agree?

1294
01:04:06.633 --> 01:04:09.508
That Edward and
Willoughby are the same?


1295
01:04:09.549 --> 01:04:11.007
No.

1296
01:04:11.049 --> 01:04:12.216
No, I do not.

1297
01:04:12.257 --> 01:04:14.049
You knew?

1298
01:04:14.091 --> 01:04:16.383
I did.

1299
01:04:16.424 --> 01:04:19.174
Lucy told me herself
the day we met them.


1300
01:04:19.216 --> 01:04:20.299
She made me promise--

1301
01:04:20.341 --> 01:04:21.840
At Barton Park?

1302
01:04:21.882 --> 01:04:23.924
That was ages ago.

1303
01:04:23.965 --> 01:04:27.174
Oh, Elinor, you loved Edward
so, yet you showed no sign.


1304
01:04:27.216 --> 01:04:29.299
How have you borne
this burden so easily?


1305
01:04:32.424 --> 01:04:35.216
Easily?

1306
01:04:35.257 --> 01:04:38.049
Do you really think this
has been easy for me?


1307
01:04:44.591 --> 01:04:47.882
John was not the only one
who made a promise to Father.


1308
01:04:47.924 --> 01:04:51.466
He also made me promise to
hold our family together.


1309
01:04:51.508 --> 01:04:55.049
And I, unlike our brother, have
done everything in my power


1310
01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:56.840
to keep that promise.

1311
01:04:56.882 --> 01:04:59.508
Since the very moment we were
cast out of Norland Park,


1312
01:04:59.549 --> 01:05:03.049
I have buried my every
desire, ignored my every wish


1313
01:05:03.091 --> 01:05:04.924
while you, Marianne,
have thought of nothing,


1314
01:05:04.965 --> 01:05:08.591
nothing but yourself.

1315
01:05:08.633 --> 01:05:09.633
Do I love Edward?

1316
01:05:09.674 --> 01:05:11.007
Yes, I love him.

1317
01:05:11.049 --> 01:05:12.424
There, I've said it.

1318
01:05:12.466 --> 01:05:14.216
But I also love you, Marianne.

1319
01:05:14.257 --> 01:05:16.341
And I love Mother,
and I love Meg.


1320
01:05:16.383 --> 01:05:18.466
And I knew this knowledge
would break your heart just


1321
01:05:18.508 --> 01:05:20.715
as it broke mine, so I endured.

1322
01:05:20.757 --> 01:05:22.674
I endured this secret
that was forced


1323
01:05:22.715 --> 01:05:28.341
upon me by the very person
who caused my heartbreak.


1324
01:05:28.383 --> 01:05:34.049
I can assure you,
Marianne, this is not easy.


1325
01:05:34.091 --> 01:05:36.549
Nothing has been easy.

1326
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.799
Oh, Elinor.

1327
01:05:47.508 --> 01:05:48.257
Thank you.

1328
01:05:51.966 --> 01:05:53.007
Oh, dear.

1329
01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:56.383
What is it?

1330
01:05:56.424 --> 01:05:57.799
Nothing.

1331
01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:58.674
Nothing.

1332
01:05:58.715 --> 01:05:59.882
It just--

1333
01:05:59.924 --> 01:06:00.799
What is it?

1334
01:06:05.216 --> 01:06:09.341
It's a wedding announcement.

1335
01:06:09.383 --> 01:06:12.466
Um, it appears that
Mr. Willoughby is


1336
01:06:12.508 --> 01:06:14.590
now officially a married man.

1337
01:06:20.882 --> 01:06:23.508
Marianne.

1338
01:06:25.966 --> 01:06:29.007
I've never seen her like this.

1339
01:06:29.049 --> 01:06:30.632
Oh.

1340
01:06:30.674 --> 01:06:32.882
I wish there were a way
to get her back to Mother.


1341
01:06:32.924 --> 01:06:36.091
Oh, I blame myself.

1342
01:06:36.132 --> 01:06:37.466
I thought it best
to send the Steele


1343
01:06:37.508 --> 01:06:39.590
girls back as soon as possible.

1344
01:06:39.632 --> 01:06:42.674
It'll be days before
their carriage returns.


1345
01:06:42.715 --> 01:06:45.174
I may have an idea.

1346
01:06:49.757 --> 01:06:50.549
Colonel Brandon.

1347
01:06:58.299 --> 01:07:00.341
I'm in your debt.

1348
01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:04.049
It is so kind of to cut your
visit short for our benefit.


1349
01:07:04.091 --> 01:07:07.007
My business here is concluded.

1350
01:07:07.049 --> 01:07:09.299
Elinor, heard
you were leaving,


1351
01:07:09.341 --> 01:07:12.007
and I just had to
come and say goodbye.


1352
01:07:12.049 --> 01:07:14.007
John, do you know
Colonel Brandon?


1353
01:07:14.049 --> 01:07:16.424
No, I haven't
had the pleasure.


1354
01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:18.174
Pleasure is
mine, Mr. Dashwood.


1355
01:07:18.216 --> 01:07:19.841
The Colonel's been
kind enough to take


1356
01:07:19.882 --> 01:07:20.882
us back to Barton Cottage.

1357
01:07:20.924 --> 01:07:22.007
Oh.

1358
01:07:22.049 --> 01:07:23.841
Well then, you have my thanks.

1359
01:07:28.383 --> 01:07:30.341
You have such a long
journey ahead of you.


1360
01:07:30.383 --> 01:07:32.882
I must insist that
you stop and stay


1361
01:07:32.924 --> 01:07:35.799
a few nights at Norland Park.

1362
01:07:35.841 --> 01:07:39.299
Oh, that's a
surprising-but-generous offer.


1363
01:07:39.341 --> 01:07:41.882
Why should it surprise you?

1364
01:07:41.924 --> 01:07:43.424
Never mind.

1365
01:07:43.466 --> 01:07:46.799
That wasn't a sincere
question, was it?


1366
01:07:46.841 --> 01:07:48.882
I'm many things, Elinor,
but I'm not stupid.


1367
01:07:51.966 --> 01:07:55.590
I must apologize to you for
the way you've been treated.


1368
01:07:55.632 --> 01:07:59.799
I should have stood
up for you more,


1369
01:07:59.841 --> 01:08:01.341
and that is something that I--

1370
01:08:01.383 --> 01:08:05.299
John, we are all trying to
make our way in the world.


1371
01:08:05.341 --> 01:08:07.715
Some of us are guided by
what we think of ourselves,


1372
01:08:07.757 --> 01:08:09.465
some by what others say.

1373
01:08:12.007 --> 01:08:16.174
I will accept your generous
offer to stay at Norland Park.


1374
01:08:16.216 --> 01:08:19.007
That, at least, pleases me.

1375
01:08:19.049 --> 01:08:20.258
I shall send word.

1376
01:08:20.299 --> 01:08:22.507
Safe journey, Elinor.

1377
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:33.049
You have a way of speaking
to others in a manner they need


1378
01:08:33.091 --> 01:08:36.507
to be spoken to,
which makes me think


1379
01:08:36.549 --> 01:08:38.341
you are the right person to--

1380
01:08:42.258 --> 01:08:44.924
before we depart for Devonshire,
I would ask you to make


1381
01:08:44.966 --> 01:08:47.841
someone an offer on my behalf.

1382
01:08:47.882 --> 01:08:49.507
But I don't understand.

1383
01:08:49.549 --> 01:08:54.341
Why would Colonel Brandon
offer me a home on his estate?


1384
01:08:54.383 --> 01:08:56.507
The Colonel has
something of a soft spot


1385
01:08:56.549 --> 01:09:00.966
for couples kept apart
due to the disapproval


1386
01:09:01.007 --> 01:09:02.507
of their families.

1387
01:09:02.549 --> 01:09:04.341
But I've never
even met the man.


1388
01:09:04.383 --> 01:09:06.174
He's heard many
good things about you


1389
01:09:06.216 --> 01:09:11.424
from me, from Marianne,
from my mother.


1390
01:09:11.465 --> 01:09:13.590
So this is a
favor to you, then.


1391
01:09:13.632 --> 01:09:15.841
He knows that I--

1392
01:09:15.882 --> 01:09:19.133
that, um, we care for you.

1393
01:09:19.174 --> 01:09:23.049
But he would not have made this
offer if he did not think you


1394
01:09:23.091 --> 01:09:25.924
honorable on your own merits.

1395
01:09:25.966 --> 01:09:28.341
I am unworthy of
such generosity,


1396
01:09:28.382 --> 01:09:30.007
yours and the Colonel's.

1397
01:09:30.049 --> 01:09:34.924
I would not blame you if you did
not wish me to be happy at all.


1398
01:09:34.966 --> 01:09:37.507
Edward, listen to me.

1399
01:09:37.549 --> 01:09:41.716
You and Lucy were engaged long
before you and I even met.


1400
01:09:41.757 --> 01:09:45.757
In truth, I find it
admirable that you would keep


1401
01:09:45.799 --> 01:09:48.133
your commitment to her,
even under the threat


1402
01:09:48.174 --> 01:09:50.299
of disinheritance.

1403
01:09:50.341 --> 01:09:53.841
You do deserve to be happy.

1404
01:09:53.882 --> 01:09:55.507
Believe me.

1405
01:09:55.549 --> 01:09:58.382
I still think very highly
of you, and I always will.


1406
01:09:58.424 --> 01:09:59.465
I've said it before.

1407
01:10:02.465 --> 01:10:06.216
Your friendship is
a true blessing.


1408
01:10:06.258 --> 01:10:10.507
It is an honor to know
you, Elinor Dashwood.


1409
01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.465
Marianne, we're here.

1410
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:34.757
Isn't it beautiful, Marianne?

1411
01:10:34.799 --> 01:10:36.465
Yes.

1412
01:10:36.507 --> 01:10:38.757
And its beauty only reminds
me of how far we've fallen.


1413
01:10:47.008 --> 01:10:47.716
Marianne?

1414
01:10:51.841 --> 01:10:53.966
Marianne?

1415
01:10:54.008 --> 01:10:55.299
Marianne?

1416
01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:57.299
Elinor, what's wrong?

1417
01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:58.549
I can't find Marianne.

1418
01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:00.008
I don't know where
she could have


1419
01:11:00.049 --> 01:11:02.632
gotten off to in this rain.

1420
01:11:02.674 --> 01:11:03.716
I will find her.

1421
01:11:03.757 --> 01:11:04.340
I promise.

1422
01:11:04.382 --> 01:11:05.966
Please do.

1423
01:11:12.008 --> 01:11:14.757
Marianne, what on Earth
are you doing out here?


1424
01:11:14.799 --> 01:11:16.340
What does it matter?

1425
01:11:16.382 --> 01:11:19.008
Everything I've ever had
has been taken from me.


1426
01:11:19.049 --> 01:11:19.841
There's nothing left.

1427
01:11:35.091 --> 01:11:38.799
She has a very high fever
and congestion in her lungs.


1428
01:11:38.841 --> 01:11:41.924
And it seems she's developed
a serious infection,


1429
01:11:41.966 --> 01:11:43.716
quite serious indeed.

1430
01:11:43.757 --> 01:11:47.382
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing more I can do.


1431
01:11:47.424 --> 01:11:49.549
What do you mean?

1432
01:11:49.591 --> 01:11:50.966
There has to be more you can do.

1433
01:11:51.008 --> 01:11:52.174
Surely, you can--

1434
01:11:52.216 --> 01:11:53.757
Miss Dashwood,
if what you've told


1435
01:11:53.799 --> 01:11:57.799
me is true, that she's barely
eaten or slept in days,


1436
01:11:57.841 --> 01:12:00.133
then her body simply does
not have the strength


1437
01:12:00.174 --> 01:12:01.757
to fight the infection off.

1438
01:12:01.799 --> 01:12:02.841
What are you saying?

1439
01:12:02.882 --> 01:12:04.382
I'm sorry.

1440
01:12:04.424 --> 01:12:05.882
I have other patients
that require my attention,


1441
01:12:05.924 --> 01:12:10.049
but I promise I will be
back as soon as I'm able.


1442
01:12:10.091 --> 01:12:10.841
What can I do?

1443
01:12:13.716 --> 01:12:16.340
Our mother, Colonel,
I hate to ask but--


1444
01:12:16.382 --> 01:12:17.382
You do not have to.

1445
01:12:17.424 --> 01:12:18.591
I shall leave immediately.

1446
01:12:18.632 --> 01:12:20.215
I will not rest
until I've collected


1447
01:12:20.257 --> 01:12:22.133
your mother and sister
and brought them here.


1448
01:12:31.799 --> 01:12:35.465
I don't know if you can
hear me, but I ask you.


1449
01:12:38.841 --> 01:12:41.299
I beg you.

1450
01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:43.799
Do not let yourself
suffer anymore.


1451
01:12:46.507 --> 01:12:52.507
Use that great big heart of
yours to fight off this fever.


1452
01:13:07.757 --> 01:13:09.966
Marianne?

1453
01:13:10.008 --> 01:13:10.799
Marianne?

1454
01:13:13.966 --> 01:13:15.632
Marianne?

1455
01:13:15.674 --> 01:13:16.841
Marianne?

1456
01:13:16.883 --> 01:13:17.757
Marianne?

1457
01:13:17.799 --> 01:13:19.382
Elinor.

1458
01:13:24.716 --> 01:13:27.340
You have a great big
heart, too, Elinor.


1459
01:13:32.424 --> 01:13:34.883
I was wrong, you know,
about Edward and Willoughby


1460
01:13:34.924 --> 01:13:36.424
being alike.

1461
01:13:36.466 --> 01:13:38.299
Both of them were threatened
with disinheritance,


1462
01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:40.091
but they reacted
very differently.


1463
01:13:42.799 --> 01:13:48.091
Yes, well, the outcome is
still the same, isn't it?


1464
01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:50.382
Both of us alone.

1465
01:13:50.424 --> 01:13:51.966
But we're not alone.

1466
01:13:56.507 --> 01:13:57.966
That must be Colonel
Brandon, with Mother and Meg.


1467
01:14:01.716 --> 01:14:03.382
I'm so glad she's
feeling better.


1468
01:14:03.424 --> 01:14:04.299
Much better.

1469
01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.132
Oh, thank goodness.

1470
01:14:06.174 --> 01:14:07.799
Is she awake yet?

1471
01:14:07.841 --> 01:14:10.507
Her fever broke yesterday,
and she's continued to improve.


1472
01:14:10.549 --> 01:14:13.008
She'll be happy to see you.

1473
01:14:13.049 --> 01:14:13.966
Perhaps I should wait.

1474
01:14:14.008 --> 01:14:15.299
You will not.

1475
01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:17.090
Marianne is anxious
to thank you.


1476
01:14:19.716 --> 01:14:22.799
Marianne, I
missed you so much.


1477
01:14:22.841 --> 01:14:25.008
It's so
good to see you, Darling.


1478
01:14:25.049 --> 01:14:28.340
It's good to see
you, too, Mama.


1479
01:14:28.382 --> 01:14:31.049
Colonel, thank you.

1480
01:14:34.174 --> 01:14:36.340
May we go back to
Barton Cottage?


1481
01:14:36.382 --> 01:14:39.008
You don't want to rest
here at Norland a bit longer?


1482
01:14:39.049 --> 01:14:42.132
There's places--

1483
01:14:42.174 --> 01:14:43.340
I wish to go home.

1484
01:14:50.924 --> 01:14:53.382
He truly is a man
of honor, isn't he--


1485
01:14:53.424 --> 01:14:54.632
Colonel Brandon?

1486
01:14:54.674 --> 01:14:56.549
He certainly is.

1487
01:14:56.591 --> 01:14:59.758
The way he rushed
us to your side,


1488
01:14:59.799 --> 01:15:03.132
I don't think the man
slept for three days.


1489
01:15:03.174 --> 01:15:05.299
Yes, that was sweet.

1490
01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.591
But I was talking
about his past.


1491
01:15:07.632 --> 01:15:10.132
He stayed true to the woman
he loved despite his father's


1492
01:15:10.174 --> 01:15:11.174
disapproval.

1493
01:15:11.215 --> 01:15:12.799
He went to war for her.

1494
01:15:12.841 --> 01:15:15.883
He sought her out after she
was cast out by his family.


1495
01:15:15.924 --> 01:15:19.966
He even took on the child
she had by another man.


1496
01:15:20.008 --> 01:15:23.924
I could not have been
more wrong about him.


1497
01:15:23.966 --> 01:15:27.841
When we first met, I didn't
think him romantic at all.


1498
01:15:27.883 --> 01:15:32.758
As it turns out, he was the most
romantic man I've ever known.


1499
01:15:43.466 --> 01:15:44.841
That's the last of it.

1500
01:15:44.883 --> 01:15:46.549
Are you sure you don't
want to stay for dinner?


1501
01:15:46.591 --> 01:15:48.132
I would love to,
but I'm afraid I


1502
01:15:48.174 --> 01:15:49.591
must get back to Delaford.

1503
01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:51.466
I've been gone for
quite a while now.


1504
01:15:51.507 --> 01:15:55.299
Perhaps-- perhaps I could
come and see Delaford one day?


1505
01:15:55.341 --> 01:15:56.674
Nothing would make me happier.

1506
01:16:12.007 --> 01:16:14.466
Nice to see that smile again.

1507
01:16:14.507 --> 01:16:16.507
It's nice to be home.

1508
01:16:16.549 --> 01:16:19.257
Colonel Brandon's promised to
invite me to Delaford soon.


1509
01:16:19.299 --> 01:16:20.758
I'll wager he has.

1510
01:16:20.799 --> 01:16:21.633
Can I come?

1511
01:16:21.674 --> 01:16:24.883
Not on Marianne's first visit.

1512
01:16:24.924 --> 01:16:26.257
Welcome back, ma'am.

1513
01:16:26.299 --> 01:16:27.965
Oh, I nearly forgot.

1514
01:16:28.007 --> 01:16:31.382
I was running errands in town,
preparing for your return,


1515
01:16:31.424 --> 01:16:34.549
and I happened to run into
acquaintances of yours.


1516
01:16:34.591 --> 01:16:35.132
Oh?

1517
01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:36.965
Yes.

1518
01:16:37.007 --> 01:16:40.341
The newly-wedded Mr. and Mrs.
Ferrars send their regards.


1519
01:17:00.591 --> 01:17:02.215
Welcome to Delaford.

1520
01:17:02.257 --> 01:17:04.174
It's beautiful.

1521
01:17:04.215 --> 01:17:06.716
Your whole estate is beautiful.

1522
01:17:06.758 --> 01:17:09.841
Edward's cottage
is just down there.


1523
01:17:09.883 --> 01:17:12.382
I'm sure he and Lucy
will be very happy here.


1524
01:17:12.424 --> 01:17:14.049
I understand that
Mr. Willoughby's aunt


1525
01:17:14.090 --> 01:17:16.299
has forgiven him and
assured him that he shall


1526
01:17:16.341 --> 01:17:18.382
receive his full inheritance.

1527
01:17:18.424 --> 01:17:20.215
Oh.

1528
01:17:20.257 --> 01:17:22.841
Yes.

1529
01:17:22.883 --> 01:17:24.758
If he'd only been
patient, he could


1530
01:17:24.799 --> 01:17:29.883
have had it all, his fortune
and the woman he loves.


1531
01:17:29.924 --> 01:17:32.424
Even if that were so,
he wouldn't have deserved


1532
01:17:32.466 --> 01:17:33.341
the love of that woman.

1533
01:17:36.591 --> 01:17:39.174
Besides, her affections
lie elsewhere now.


1534
01:17:51.924 --> 01:17:54.299
And I said yes.

1535
01:17:57.716 --> 01:17:59.882
Oh, Marianne.

1536
01:17:59.924 --> 01:18:01.549
He's assured me
he'll visit later today


1537
01:18:01.591 --> 01:18:02.716
to ask for your blessing.

1538
01:18:02.758 --> 01:18:05.299
Oh, he will have it.

1539
01:18:05.341 --> 01:18:06.549
We're going to miss you.

1540
01:18:06.591 --> 01:18:07.716
Delaford's very close.

1541
01:18:07.758 --> 01:18:09.758
We'll see each other
all of the time.


1542
01:18:09.799 --> 01:18:14.257
But Edward's at Delaford.

1543
01:18:14.299 --> 01:18:15.633
Come, dear.

1544
01:18:15.674 --> 01:18:17.716
We have a wedding to plan.

1545
01:18:25.633 --> 01:18:34.591
I-- Edward and Lucy's
marriage is what we expected.


1546
01:18:34.633 --> 01:18:37.965
I told myself not to hope
for anything different.


1547
01:18:38.007 --> 01:18:41.216
But it was too
late, wasn't it?


1548
01:18:41.257 --> 01:18:42.341
Hope had already entered.

1549
01:18:47.424 --> 01:18:48.674
There's no sense in it now.

1550
01:18:51.341 --> 01:18:54.049
It's done.

1551
01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:56.716
He's married.

1552
01:19:11.424 --> 01:19:12.257
I'll be calm.

1553
01:19:16.549 --> 01:19:20.174
I'll be mistress of myself.

1554
01:19:20.216 --> 01:19:22.549
Be calm.

1555
01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.049
Mother, whose horse--

1556
01:19:27.549 --> 01:19:28.299
Miss Dashwood.

1557
01:19:31.174 --> 01:19:33.924
Mr. Ferrars.

1558
01:19:33.965 --> 01:19:38.424
Are you visiting us from
your new home in Delaford?


1559
01:19:38.466 --> 01:19:40.424
Yes, I arrived just yesterday.

1560
01:19:40.466 --> 01:19:43.049
It's a lovely cottage.

1561
01:19:43.090 --> 01:19:46.382
And how is Mrs. Ferrars?

1562
01:19:46.424 --> 01:19:48.549
My stepmother is well.

1563
01:19:48.591 --> 01:19:50.633
Thank you.

1564
01:19:50.674 --> 01:19:52.382
Perhaps I should say
she's in good health.


1565
01:19:52.424 --> 01:19:53.591
I suppose she'll never be well.

1566
01:19:53.633 --> 01:20:00.257
No, I mean Mrs.
Edward Ferrars.


1567
01:20:00.299 --> 01:20:01.591
Oh.

1568
01:20:01.633 --> 01:20:02.924
You haven't heard?

1569
01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:11.382
From the way that gossip seems
to travel in our circles,


1570
01:20:11.424 --> 01:20:12.257
I had assumed that--

1571
01:20:17.965 --> 01:20:22.132
once my inheritance
went to my brother,


1572
01:20:22.174 --> 01:20:26.299
it seemed as though Miss
Lucy Steele's affections


1573
01:20:26.341 --> 01:20:28.049
went that way as well.

1574
01:20:28.091 --> 01:20:33.216
And so Lucy is now
Mrs. Robert Ferrars.


1575
01:20:33.257 --> 01:20:35.840
Apparently, my stepmother's
prejudices against Lucy


1576
01:20:35.882 --> 01:20:39.299
were outweighed by her desire
to punish and humiliate me.


1577
01:20:39.341 --> 01:20:43.757
So-- so--

1578
01:20:43.799 --> 01:20:48.257
so you're-- you're--
you're not married?


1579
01:20:48.299 --> 01:20:49.424
No.

1580
01:20:55.216 --> 01:20:56.049
Elinor.

1581
01:21:00.466 --> 01:21:01.257
Elinor.

1582
01:21:05.591 --> 01:21:08.549
I would not blame you if
you wanted me to leave,


1583
01:21:08.591 --> 01:21:12.007
but please allow me--

1584
01:21:12.049 --> 01:21:15.674
my engagement to Lucy
was a folly of youth.


1585
01:21:15.715 --> 01:21:22.715
I never felt for her or for
anyone what I feel for you.


1586
01:21:22.757 --> 01:21:25.132
And I don't care what
my stepsister thinks,


1587
01:21:25.174 --> 01:21:27.257
or my stepmother, or anyone.

1588
01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:30.633
I will not marry for fortune,
nor out of obligation.


1589
01:21:30.674 --> 01:21:33.549
I want to marry for love.

1590
01:21:33.591 --> 01:21:35.257
And I love you, Elinor.

1591
01:21:39.299 --> 01:21:42.715
I know my own happiness now.

1592
01:21:42.757 --> 01:21:45.633
And in truth, I have
known it for some time.


1593
01:21:45.674 --> 01:21:49.840
It lies with you, Elinor.

1594
01:21:49.882 --> 01:21:53.966
I love you with all my heart.

1595
01:21:54.007 --> 01:21:57.174
I have been in love
with you since--


1596
01:21:57.216 --> 01:22:00.466
since we first met at Norland.

1597
01:22:00.508 --> 01:22:03.632
I tried to deny it out
of some misguided sense


1598
01:22:03.674 --> 01:22:05.257
of duty or honor.

1599
01:22:05.299 --> 01:22:10.257
But-- but it would
not be denied.


1600
01:22:10.299 --> 01:22:13.840
My love for you
has never wavered.


1601
01:22:13.882 --> 01:22:17.257
And I will continue to love
you until the day I die.


1602
01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:22.674
I came here today
with one errand


1603
01:22:22.715 --> 01:22:25.591
in mind, which I
will now perform.


1604
01:22:28.549 --> 01:22:30.591
Oh.

1605
01:22:30.632 --> 01:22:39.383
Elinor Dashwood, will
you do me the great honor


1606
01:22:39.424 --> 01:22:42.466
of becoming my wife?

1607
01:22:42.508 --> 01:22:44.258
Yes.

1608
01:22:44.299 --> 01:22:46.383
Yes, I'll marry you.

1609
01:23:04.258 --> 01:23:07.216
I pronounce they
be man and wife together.
