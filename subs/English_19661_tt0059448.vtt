1
00:01:50.308 --> 00:01:52.443
What happened?
Press the door button.


2
00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:53.720
I think the electricity's off.

3
00:01:56.814 --> 00:02:00.218
Where ya going, Louise??
I don't know,
I just had to get out of there.


4
00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:02.953
Mr. Haddock is grabby enough
when the lights are on.


5
00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:05.026
Hey, I could go in there,
and he'd think he was you.


6
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.360
This'll probably make me
late for the theatre.


7
00:02:09.393 --> 00:02:12.230
What are you seeing??
Benefit. The whole thing.
Deductible.


8
00:02:12.263 --> 00:02:13.640
Yeah, I know,
but what are you seeing?


9
00:02:13.664 --> 00:02:15.799
You know, that thing
with what's-her-name.


10
00:02:18.902 --> 00:02:21.605
Hey, there's a live one.
Go ahead, ask him.


11
00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.640
Oh, you ask him.

12
00:02:25.876 --> 00:02:28.579
Everybody's going to
the boardroom in 2709...


13
00:02:28.612 --> 00:02:30.414
The one
with no windows?


14
00:02:30.448 --> 00:02:33.584
We're having a party.
Want to come?
Tell him what kind!


15
00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:36.620
It's a Braille party.

16
00:02:36.654 --> 00:02:39.723
A what?
Braille.
Get it?


17
00:02:39.757 --> 00:02:43.694
The touch system.
Oh! Well, um...
Thanks, but...


18
00:02:43.727 --> 00:02:46.297
David?
Hey! Don't do that!


19
00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.266
Who is it?
Josephson.


20
00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.801
I just got a call to
come up to C.C.'s office.


21
00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:53.771
With all that inner
holy light His Eminence
is radiating these days,


22
00:02:53.804 --> 00:02:55.673
he may not have noticed
the blackout.


23
00:02:55.706 --> 00:02:58.276
Stick around. It won't
be long we have a drinkie!
Oh, no chance.


24
00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:00.511
I've already passed
on one orgy. I have to go.


25
00:03:00.544 --> 00:03:03.381
Not me. We're marooned
on a mountain, bubi.


26
00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:05.983
Whoever pulled that plug
gave me a foolproof
excuse for the wife.


27
00:03:06.016 --> 00:03:08.552
Well, then, that lets
me out, bubi baby.


28
00:03:08.586 --> 00:03:11.989
I haven't anyone to cheat.
I heard you were
in the mood, sweetheart.


29
00:03:12.022 --> 00:03:14.625
Well, don't take any
wooden Indians. Ciao.


30
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.366
You know, I could be
in a whole lot of trouble.


31
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.668
How come??
I was using that new machine,
you know,


32
00:03:24.702 --> 00:03:27.571
the one I could never
figure out?
Did you break it?


33
00:03:27.605 --> 00:03:30.045
That wouldn't be so bad.
I'm scared I broke
the whole building!


34
00:03:45.923 --> 00:03:50.294
Would you help me, please?

35
00:03:50.328 --> 00:03:52.696
It was foolish of me to start
down alone in the dark.


36
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.965
It's like being
buried alive.


37
00:03:54.998 --> 00:03:57.835
I promise to behave myself!

38
00:03:57.868 --> 00:03:59.737
Don't worry.
I can always scream for help.


39
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.472
Well, isn't it though?
What?


40
00:04:01.505 --> 00:04:03.641
A small world.
I heard you were back.


41
00:04:03.674 --> 00:04:05.709
I really am very glad
to see you!


42
00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:08.346
If I could see you, that is.
Well, slow down a minute.


43
00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.357
You wouldn't happen to know
why he did it, would you?


44
00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:12.483
Cut off the electricity,
I mean.


45
00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:15.319
If it were anyone else,
I'd say it was a practical joke,


46
00:04:15.353 --> 00:04:16.763
but not the Major,
he never would have...


47
00:04:16.787 --> 00:04:18.922
Don't you ever stop
to take a breath?


48
00:04:18.956 --> 00:04:20.991
Look, I'm sorry, but
I haven't been away.


49
00:04:21.024 --> 00:04:25.062
I don't know any Major,
and I'm afraid I've never
seen you before, either.


50
00:04:25.095 --> 00:04:27.698
Believe me, I'd remember.

51
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:30.701
But your voice! I tho...
That's all right.


52
00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:34.405
After 27 flights
of stairs, we may wind
up being old friends.


53
00:04:34.438 --> 00:04:36.474
We better get started.
I don't trust this light.


54
00:04:39.777 --> 00:04:42.480
I think the entire
building's gone mad.


55
00:04:42.513 --> 00:04:44.415
Everyone's running around
trying to rescind


56
00:04:44.448 --> 00:04:46.517
the Ten Commandments.

57
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.787
I've never
understood why most people
will do things in the dark...


58
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.723
that they'd never think
of doing in the light.


59
00:04:52.756 --> 00:04:55.101
I'd explain it to you,
but I'm afraid the lights
might come back on.


60
00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:56.794
Well, I'm serious!

61
00:04:56.827 --> 00:05:01.465
If we can lie, cheat, steal
and kill in broad daylight,


62
00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:03.901
and have to wait till
it's dark to make love,


63
00:05:03.934 --> 00:05:05.903
something's wrong somewhere.

64
00:05:05.936 --> 00:05:08.806
I'm beginning to wish
I were that friend of yours.


65
00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:13.143
What happened to 13?
I don't think
there is one.


66
00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:16.680
The natives are superstitious.
And you're not superstitious.


67
00:05:16.714 --> 00:05:19.750
No, I'm bushed. Couldn't
we stop and rest a minute?


68
00:05:19.783 --> 00:05:22.953
Oh, don't be a sissy.
I'm a girl. I'm supposed
to be a sissy.


69
00:05:25.956 --> 00:05:29.026
Ah, one of us should
have counted the steps.


70
00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:31.995
Maybe we'd qualify
for the Olympics.


71
00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.565
Boy, let's just
say we climbed it
because it was there.


72
00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:44.675
I'm not as horrible
as all that.


73
00:05:44.708 --> 00:05:46.777
I knew it was you.

74
00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.414
That was a stupid joke.

75
00:05:50.448 --> 00:05:52.683
I don't know
what you're talking about.


76
00:05:52.716 --> 00:05:54.885
Look, my name's
David Stillwell.


77
00:05:54.918 --> 00:05:56.654
What's yours?

78
00:05:58.856 --> 00:06:00.096
Wait a minute!

79
00:06:01.559 --> 00:06:04.061
What did I say?

80
00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:07.130
Wait!

81
00:06:08.532 --> 00:06:10.468
Wait a minute!

82
00:06:14.572 --> 00:06:16.406
Where are you going?

83
00:06:51.642 --> 00:06:52.719
Dead?
Who is it,
do you know?


84
00:06:52.743 --> 00:06:54.478
I can't see.
A man or a women?


85
00:06:54.512 --> 00:06:56.980
Did you see him jump?
No, I always miss those things.


86
00:06:57.014 --> 00:06:59.125
Did you notice which window?
No, but I...


87
00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:01.218
Which floor then?
I don't know.


88
00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:03.229
What's the matter??
Couldn't he wait
for the elevator?


89
00:07:03.253 --> 00:07:05.889
Just stand back.
It's the worst way to go.


90
00:07:05.923 --> 00:07:08.526
The worst.
If I had the guts to
step out of that window,


91
00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:09.969
I'd have had the guts
to go on living.


92
00:07:24.307 --> 00:07:28.512
Been a lot of
suicide lately. Two in our
building already this year.


93
00:07:28.546 --> 00:07:30.590
I got smashed last summer,
and dropped a watermelon


94
00:07:30.614 --> 00:07:32.215
out of our living room window.

95
00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:35.553
We're on the 14th floor.
What on earth for?


96
00:07:35.586 --> 00:07:37.864
Haven't you ever wondered what
a watermelon would sound like,


97
00:07:37.888 --> 00:07:41.058
from 14 floors up?
Okay, what'd it sound like?


98
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:42.251
About like he did.

99
00:07:47.765 --> 00:07:51.034
Hello, Eddy.
Usual, I guess.


100
00:07:51.068 --> 00:07:53.937
The usual?
Scotch and lemon peel.


101
00:07:53.971 --> 00:07:56.774
Give me some change,
will you, Eddy?
Yeah.


102
00:07:56.807 --> 00:07:59.109
Haven't seen much
of you lately.


103
00:07:59.142 --> 00:08:00.978
Yeah, I uh,
skipped lunch.


104
00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:06.083
Hey! What are you
doin' here?


105
00:08:06.116 --> 00:08:08.018
I thought it was you.

106
00:08:08.051 --> 00:08:09.519
I knew it was you.

107
00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:15.859
That'll be 90 cents.

108
00:08:17.828 --> 00:08:19.229
I said, that'll be

109
00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:23.767
Sorry.

110
00:08:36.313 --> 00:08:38.616
?? [jazz cornet]

111
00:09:58.095 --> 00:10:01.064
Could you tell me
where the stairs are?
Louder!


112
00:10:01.098 --> 00:10:03.333
Could you tell me
where the stairs are?


113
00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:06.704
The ones that lead down
to the sub-basement.
There aren't any!


114
00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:10.373
There aren't any what?
Stairs!


115
00:10:10.407 --> 00:10:13.777
Or sub-basements.
This is it!


116
00:10:13.811 --> 00:10:16.747
But I was just down there!
A few minutes ago!


117
00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.117
Not in this building
you weren't, and you're not
even supposed to be here.


118
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:22.019
Now beat it, I'm busy!

119
00:10:32.129 --> 00:10:33.864
Evening, Mr. Turtle.

120
00:10:33.897 --> 00:10:38.101
Oh, don't tell me.
Your name is Mister, um...


121
00:10:38.135 --> 00:10:42.039
Mr... Stillwell, right?
Well, I'm glad you found it.


122
00:10:42.072 --> 00:10:44.942
The way it's been going,
I'm not too sure myself.


123
00:10:44.975 --> 00:10:48.145
I know you on account
of you're the only man
in this whole building


124
00:10:48.178 --> 00:10:51.281
who can say my name
without makin' it
sound like a joke.


125
00:10:51.314 --> 00:10:53.083
Know what I mean?

126
00:10:53.116 --> 00:10:55.352
You work with
Mr. Josephson, don't you?


127
00:10:55.385 --> 00:10:58.956
Do you know what
he calls me? Sweetheart.


128
00:10:58.989 --> 00:11:01.901
You're losing touch.
Sweetheart's what they call
total strangers these days.


129
00:11:01.925 --> 00:11:05.162
Oh yeah? He says it
next time and I'll sock him.


130
00:11:05.195 --> 00:11:07.430
You can call me Joe.

131
00:11:07.464 --> 00:11:11.234
The man who jumped.
You know who he was?
Mm-mm.


132
00:11:11.268 --> 00:11:13.270
It was a big one,
I can tell you that.


133
00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:16.106
Look here. The mayor...

134
00:11:16.139 --> 00:11:19.977
went up five minutes ago,
shortly after the lights
came back on.


135
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.145
First jumper we've ever had
that rated the mayor.


136
00:11:24.147 --> 00:11:26.016
Joe, do you know
why the lights went out?


137
00:11:26.049 --> 00:11:30.788
Oh, it was someone upstairs
playing God, most likely.


138
00:11:30.821 --> 00:11:33.356
A man living that high up
gets aspirations, you know.


139
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.959
Hmm.
Well, thanks, Joe.
Okay.


140
00:12:37.087 --> 00:12:39.823
Evening, Benny.
Mr. Stillwell.
Long time, no see.


141
00:12:41.024 --> 00:12:44.194
Well...
No, not you, too.


142
00:12:44.227 --> 00:12:46.429
Press your floor
button, please.


143
00:12:46.463 --> 00:12:48.531
Going up!

144
00:12:50.934 --> 00:12:53.303
Thanks very much. Would
you push seven, please?


145
00:12:53.336 --> 00:12:54.905
I just did.

146
00:12:54.938 --> 00:12:58.575
Stand back from
the doors, please, and
face the front of the car.


147
00:13:00.277 --> 00:13:03.113
Don't these things
just kill ya?


148
00:13:03.146 --> 00:13:06.183
I kind of miss the old guys
who used to run 'em.


149
00:13:06.216 --> 00:13:09.486
I tell ya, it's beginning
to look like people are on
their way out altogether.


150
00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:12.222
Well, maybe the machines
will keep us around for pets.


151
00:13:12.255 --> 00:13:14.992
Seventh floor. Please wait
until the doors


152
00:13:15.025 --> 00:13:17.494
have completely opened
before stepping from the car.


153
00:13:17.527 --> 00:13:20.830
What are you doing
for dinner tonight, honey?
Watch your step, please.


154
00:13:23.066 --> 00:13:26.536
Say, I wonder if you'd have
a few minutes you could spare?


155
00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:28.138
Sorry, but it's been
quite a da...


156
00:13:34.544 --> 00:13:36.880
Wha... What do you want?

157
00:13:36.914 --> 00:13:38.882
Inside.

158
00:13:42.419 --> 00:13:44.321
Quite a day.

159
00:13:48.992 --> 00:13:51.361
All right, move!

160
00:13:55.966 --> 00:13:59.669
I don't keep
a lot of cash around.


161
00:13:59.702 --> 00:14:01.638
Nice!

162
00:14:01.671 --> 00:14:04.274
It's even nicer
when there's no-one
holding a gun in it.


163
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:10.080
They got wrestling
coming in from Chicago.


164
00:14:10.113 --> 00:14:12.091
I know it's
supposed to be fixed,
but so is everything else.


165
00:14:12.115 --> 00:14:14.384
Why don't you just
take this set?


166
00:14:14.417 --> 00:14:16.486
Ah, now that all the westerns
have gone psycho,


167
00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:18.464
this is the only place left
where you can tell for sure


168
00:14:18.488 --> 00:14:21.691
who the bad guys are.

169
00:14:21.724 --> 00:14:27.197
The uh...
The Major wants to see you.


170
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:29.666
If it were anyone else,
I'd say it was practical joke,


171
00:14:29.699 --> 00:14:32.702
but not the Major.

172
00:14:32.735 --> 00:14:34.713
The Arab forcing Lord Percy
into the ropes.


173
00:14:34.737 --> 00:14:37.640
Major who?
Ah, now, look at that!


174
00:14:37.674 --> 00:14:40.610
The Arab's got the rope
around Lord Percy's neck!


175
00:14:40.643 --> 00:14:43.346
Come on, Percy!
Slip out of it,
will ya, fella?


176
00:14:46.183 --> 00:14:49.252
...and jumps his man
for the press. One...


177
00:14:49.286 --> 00:14:51.454
You better pack a bag,
Mr. Stillwell.


178
00:14:51.488 --> 00:14:53.957
Your plane leaves Kennedy
in less than two hours.


179
00:14:53.991 --> 00:14:57.694
Leaves where?
Idlewild.
They changed the name.


180
00:14:57.727 --> 00:15:00.430
Where have you been?

181
00:15:00.463 --> 00:15:02.499
I'm beginning to wonder.

182
00:15:02.532 --> 00:15:04.567
W
-Well, why the airport?

183
00:15:04.601 --> 00:15:05.735
Isn't the Major
in New York?


184
00:15:05.768 --> 00:15:08.738
Well, sure.
Sure, he's here.


185
00:15:08.771 --> 00:15:11.541
But he doesn't
want to see you here,
he wants to see you there.


186
00:15:11.574 --> 00:15:14.044
In Barbados.
You're lucky.


187
00:15:14.077 --> 00:15:16.679
I hear the weather
is gorgeous in Barbados.


188
00:15:16.713 --> 00:15:19.349
I wish you'd stop looking
as if I'm supposed to know


189
00:15:19.382 --> 00:15:22.252
what you're talking about.
Look out with the hat!


190
00:15:22.285 --> 00:15:26.356
Into the ropes he goes.
Up and over he goes again.


191
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:29.392
Time for the press.
One, two... look out.


192
00:15:29.426 --> 00:15:31.995
I can't just
leave the country.


193
00:15:32.029 --> 00:15:34.697
I have a job.
They'll ask questions.


194
00:15:34.731 --> 00:15:36.433
There won't be any questions.

195
00:15:38.268 --> 00:15:39.769
Well, I have one.

196
00:15:39.802 --> 00:15:42.439
Suppose I refuse to go?

197
00:15:42.472 --> 00:15:44.641
Well, that's up to you.

198
00:15:44.674 --> 00:15:47.777
You see that?
Now that case of yours


199
00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:51.314
goes to Barbados tonight,
with you or without you.


200
00:15:51.348 --> 00:15:53.492
Now the Major would like it
if you'd bring it yourself,


201
00:15:53.516 --> 00:15:57.354
but you, uh, can't be
live in Barbados


202
00:15:57.387 --> 00:16:00.190
and dead in New York
the same time! [Chuckling]


203
00:16:00.223 --> 00:16:03.360
...back to the headlock, Percy.
I have the feeling
that you don't care


204
00:16:03.393 --> 00:16:05.228
which way it turns out.

205
00:16:05.262 --> 00:16:08.198
No. I care, all right.

206
00:16:08.231 --> 00:16:11.301
If you're too dead to go,
I'll be in Barbados tonight,


207
00:16:11.334 --> 00:16:14.771
and I hear
the weather is gorgeous. Yes.
Weather is gorgeous.


208
00:16:14.804 --> 00:16:19.142
I know.
Forearm smash to the back
by the Arab.


209
00:16:19.176 --> 00:16:22.612
Another one. One more.
And a fist to the ear.


210
00:16:22.645 --> 00:16:25.482
And there's another one.
What's supposed
to be in here?


211
00:16:25.515 --> 00:16:27.684
Now, look. No questions...

212
00:16:27.717 --> 00:16:30.620
Here's another whip
by Lord Percy!


213
00:16:30.653 --> 00:16:32.655
Well, that slowed him down.

214
00:16:36.493 --> 00:16:39.329
Percy with a body slam.

215
00:16:39.362 --> 00:16:41.364
He's heading for
the top of the rope!


216
00:16:45.168 --> 00:16:48.805
And one... two...
three and it's over.


217
00:16:48.838 --> 00:16:51.174
Boy, the Arab
never knew what hit him.


218
00:17:29.412 --> 00:17:31.824
time,
ladies and gentlemen,


219
00:17:31.848 --> 00:17:34.151
eight minutes
and 25 seconds.


220
00:17:34.184 --> 00:17:35.485
The winner is Lord Percy.

221
00:17:37.454 --> 00:17:40.157
The Arab is now saying
something to one of the fans.


222
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:41.767
"You come up here
and see how you like it."


223
00:17:41.791 --> 00:17:45.295
Something to that effect.

224
00:17:45.328 --> 00:17:47.473
Percy turning back after him,
when he gave him both fingers


225
00:17:47.497 --> 00:17:49.466
to the eyes once more.

226
00:17:49.499 --> 00:17:51.144
Now, we'll see if
the Arab's going about it...


227
00:17:51.168 --> 00:17:53.903
...we don't want you to miss
any of the action here.


228
00:17:53.936 --> 00:17:56.139
Well, I guess that's it.

229
00:17:57.940 --> 00:17:59.542
Well, as we just
heard in the match,


230
00:17:59.576 --> 00:18:02.879
the winner in one fall
is Lord Percy.


231
00:18:02.912 --> 00:18:07.350
Say fans, I'd like to remind
you again about the wrestling
stars for next week.


232
00:18:07.384 --> 00:18:09.919
Last week, you'll recall,
I promised to announce
those stars.


233
00:18:09.952 --> 00:18:12.489
Here it is,
a real super-duper.


234
00:18:12.522 --> 00:18:15.192
Swami battles Hiro Sebuto.

235
00:18:15.225 --> 00:18:18.761
Also, there'll be Farmer Frank,
and Angel Flatfeet.


236
00:18:18.795 --> 00:18:21.264
Buffalo Bill Baker
will be on hand.


237
00:18:21.298 --> 00:18:23.166
You'll want to pick up
your tickets early


238
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.734
for next week.

239
00:18:24.767 --> 00:18:27.237
Well, we're about ready
for the next bout.


240
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:31.174
A one-fall match between
the Hayseed and Carl Von Strut.


241
00:18:31.208 --> 00:18:33.510
And it should be a lulu.

242
00:18:33.543 --> 00:18:37.680
This pair have been feuding
since Carl bit the Hayseed's
ear last February.


243
00:18:37.714 --> 00:18:39.949
Judging by the crowd...

244
00:18:39.982 --> 00:18:41.784
...place on Lower Broadway.

245
00:18:41.818 --> 00:18:43.686
Among those who rushed
to Calvin's office


246
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.822
in the Unidyne Building
were the Mayor,


247
00:18:45.855 --> 00:18:48.191
the Police Commissioner,
and the F.B.I.


248
00:18:48.225 --> 00:18:51.761
Mrs. Charles Calvin
hurried downtown from
their 5th Avenue home,


249
00:18:51.794 --> 00:18:54.664
but remained inside
her husband's office
only ten minutes.


250
00:18:54.697 --> 00:18:57.534
She was accompanied
by Crawford Gilcuddy,


251
00:18:57.567 --> 00:19:00.570
Charles Calvin's close friend
and president of Unidyne.


252
00:19:00.603 --> 00:19:02.305
Our reporter was there
when these questions


253
00:19:02.339 --> 00:19:05.942
were put to Mrs. Calvin.
Mrs. Calvin, can you
give any reason whatsoever


254
00:19:05.975 --> 00:19:08.311
why your husband might
have taken his own life?
No, I...


255
00:19:08.345 --> 00:19:10.847
Are the police convinced
it was suicide, Mrs. Calvin?


256
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.891
I have no idea what
the police think.
Do you believe it was suicide?


257
00:19:12.915 --> 00:19:14.126
Can't you see that
Mrs. Calvin's had
a terrible shock?


258
00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.719
Mrs. Calvin, could your
husband have been ill?


259
00:19:16.753 --> 00:19:18.664
I'm sure I would have been
the first to know.
Did he seem depressed?


260
00:19:18.688 --> 00:19:20.823
Well, he was discouraged...
Why is that, Mrs. Calvin?


261
00:19:20.857 --> 00:19:24.294
My husband worked very hard
for world peace! But no-one...


262
00:19:24.327 --> 00:19:26.505
Mrs. Calvin, do you think...
You're not letting her answer!


263
00:19:26.529 --> 00:19:28.441
You've got
to give her a chance.
No-one else seemed to care!


264
00:19:28.465 --> 00:19:29.808
No-one did anything!
Now, that's enough!


265
00:19:29.832 --> 00:19:33.303
Mrs. Calvin...
Mrs. Calvin, one more question:


266
00:19:33.336 --> 00:19:36.573
No man in America
today is regarded in
just the same manner


267
00:19:36.606 --> 00:19:38.608
as was Charles Stewart Calvin,

268
00:19:38.641 --> 00:19:41.010
holding himself aloof
from political ties


269
00:19:41.043 --> 00:19:43.346
and therefore
from political office,


270
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.982
Calvin was courted by
conservative and liberal alike.


271
00:19:46.015 --> 00:19:47.750
But in his own words
from a speech filmed


272
00:19:47.784 --> 00:19:48.951
less than two months ago...

273
00:19:48.985 --> 00:19:54.491
"The only political philosophy
I recognize is...


274
00:19:54.524 --> 00:19:56.593
world peace."

275
00:19:56.626 --> 00:20:00.897
a beautiful,
brand-new kitchen.


276
00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:01.940
Larry, let's show her,
shall we?


277
00:20:01.964 --> 00:20:03.900
First, this automatic
time range,


278
00:20:03.933 --> 00:20:06.002
all built in
for your convenience.


279
00:20:06.035 --> 00:20:07.404
And I know
you like to cook.


280
00:20:07.437 --> 00:20:09.972
And over in the corner here
Larry, too, and Mrs. Lewis,


281
00:20:10.006 --> 00:20:12.342
a self-defrosting
refrigerator.


282
00:20:12.375 --> 00:20:15.312
Right next to that,
an automatic washer and dryer...


283
00:20:15.345 --> 00:20:17.714
All in matching colors...
And that's not all.


284
00:20:17.747 --> 00:20:20.583
A "sanitarized" dishwasher,
for you too, Mrs. Lewis.


285
00:20:20.617 --> 00:20:23.286
This automatic mixer,
juicer and blender,


286
00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.889
and a 10-cup coffee maker...
and it's all yours with
our compliments, Mrs. Lewis.


287
00:20:26.923 --> 00:20:28.791
Take it from us...
Right, audience?


288
00:20:46.876 --> 00:20:48.911
I'm sor...

289
00:20:48.945 --> 00:20:51.013
...not in service
at this time.


290
00:20:51.047 --> 00:20:53.750
The number you have reached
is not in service at this time.


291
00:20:53.783 --> 00:20:57.320
This is a recording.
I'm sorry, the number
you have reached


292
00:20:57.354 --> 00:20:58.588
is not in service
at this time.


293
00:21:33.923 --> 00:21:36.559
Yes?
David.


294
00:21:36.593 --> 00:21:37.560
It's me, Josephson.

295
00:21:37.594 --> 00:21:40.497
Well, I was just
trying to call you,


296
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.832
but the phone was
disconnected or something.


297
00:21:42.865 --> 00:21:45.835
You sure? What number
did you call?


298
00:21:45.868 --> 00:21:50.473
Digby 4-4762.
Digby? We haven't used Digby
in almost two years now.


299
00:21:50.507 --> 00:21:52.074
They switched us
to Hanover.


300
00:21:52.108 --> 00:21:56.379
What'd you do, cookie?
Forget?


301
00:21:56.413 --> 00:22:00.149
Yes, I
-I guess so.

302
00:22:00.182 --> 00:22:02.952
Not enough beddy-bye,
if you ask me.


303
00:22:02.985 --> 00:22:05.788
Too much would be
more like it. I overslept.


304
00:22:05.822 --> 00:22:10.059
That's why I'm late.
Late? Late for what?


305
00:22:10.092 --> 00:22:11.704
I heard you wouldn't be
in at all for a few days.


306
00:22:11.728 --> 00:22:14.697
You're supposed
to be taking a cruise
to the islands or something.


307
00:22:14.731 --> 00:22:16.365
There won't be
any questions.


308
00:22:18.034 --> 00:22:20.603
Hey, Dave... are you
still there, baby?


309
00:22:22.605 --> 00:22:27.176
Yes. Yes, I'm still here.

310
00:22:27.209 --> 00:22:32.482
Josephson, if you heard
I was taking a cruise
to the islands,


311
00:22:32.515 --> 00:22:34.417
why did you call?

312
00:22:34.451 --> 00:22:36.853
I didn't know what time
you'd be leaving.


313
00:22:36.886 --> 00:22:39.088
And I didn't want
you to go without
saying aloha, bubi.


314
00:22:40.657 --> 00:22:42.925
Well, save it,
bubi-baby-sweetie.


315
00:22:42.959 --> 00:22:45.728
I'm not going.
Well, that's too bad.


316
00:22:45.762 --> 00:22:48.531
I hear the weather
is gorgeous down there.


317
00:23:04.847 --> 00:23:07.584
The uh, desk sergeant
said that I should see you.


318
00:23:07.617 --> 00:23:09.118
You makin' a complaint?
That's right.


319
00:23:09.151 --> 00:23:10.853
Mm-hmm. Have a seat.

320
00:23:15.658 --> 00:23:18.628
Look at that. Would you
believe I made all-city
guard in high school?


321
00:23:18.661 --> 00:23:23.065
Football?
Oh, fun-ny!


322
00:23:23.099 --> 00:23:26.102
I'm Lieutenant Franklin.

323
00:23:26.135 --> 00:23:29.138
I'm David Stil...
Hold it. You'll only
have to tell me again.


324
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.912
O-kay... shoot.

325
00:23:35.945 --> 00:23:38.080
I'm David Stillwell.
Double-L, double-L?


326
00:23:38.114 --> 00:23:40.650
That's right.

327
00:23:42.752 --> 00:23:46.923
Address?
It's 140 E. 56th Street,
Apartment 7G.


328
00:23:50.527 --> 00:23:53.863
Phone?
It's, uh...


329
00:23:53.896 --> 00:23:55.131
It's Murray Hill...
something.


330
00:23:57.266 --> 00:23:59.678
Well, it's the something
part we're interested in,
Mr. Stillwell.


331
00:23:59.702 --> 00:24:01.538
Care to make a stab at it?

332
00:24:01.571 --> 00:24:03.606
Well, you see, I...
I live alone,


333
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.150
so there's no reason
for me to call it.


334
00:24:05.174 --> 00:24:08.244
It's in the book.
Okay, I'll track it down.


335
00:24:08.277 --> 00:24:10.847
Date and uh,
place of birth.


336
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:13.225
Tell me, how many
more of these questions
do I have to answer?


337
00:24:13.249 --> 00:24:15.528
Just a couple.
But you don't even know
what my complaint is yet.


338
00:24:15.552 --> 00:24:17.587
And it's killin' me!

339
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.089
But let's both of us
try to contain ourselves
a little longer,


340
00:24:20.122 --> 00:24:21.824
until we get this
finished, huh?


341
00:24:21.858 --> 00:24:25.194
Now, how about it?
Date and place of birth?


342
00:24:25.227 --> 00:24:27.797
Someone threatened to kill me
unless I left the country.


343
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.100
Oops.
There, you've done it.


344
00:24:31.133 --> 00:24:32.945
Don't you want to play
by the rules, Mr. Stillwell?


345
00:24:32.969 --> 00:24:35.304
Now, look, I wasn't
all-city anything
in high school.


346
00:24:35.337 --> 00:24:37.707
All I know is
that somebody's
trying to kill me.


347
00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:39.676
And you want us
to do something, right?


348
00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:42.845
Well, I think that's why
I came in here, if I can
remember that far back.


349
00:24:42.879 --> 00:24:45.181
Fine. And we will do
something, I promise.


350
00:24:45.214 --> 00:24:48.918
Just as soon as
we finish answering these
few, simple questions.


351
00:24:48.951 --> 00:24:50.631
Like date and place
of birth, for instance.


352
00:24:53.155 --> 00:24:56.559
Forget it.

353
00:24:56.593 --> 00:24:58.194
Forget the whole thing.

354
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:58.755
You'll enjoy that.
It's eminently readable.


355
00:25:58.788 --> 00:25:59.988
Stuck for
the lot of them, huh?


356
00:26:02.859 --> 00:26:05.194
I'll take it.
You won't regret it!


357
00:26:05.227 --> 00:26:07.797
It gave me tons
of fresh insight.


358
00:26:12.034 --> 00:26:13.679
Would it be possible to see
Dr. Broden right away?


359
00:26:13.703 --> 00:26:15.304
It's quite urgent.

360
00:26:15.337 --> 00:26:17.907
Who recommended you
to this office,
Mr. Stillwell?


361
00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.844
Dr. Ellman.
Max Ellman.


362
00:26:23.112 --> 00:26:24.847
Just a moment, please.

363
00:26:27.283 --> 00:26:30.753
Mr. Stillwell, the doctor
can see you in 40 minutes.


364
00:26:30.787 --> 00:26:33.690
Thank you. If I came over now,
could I wait in the office?


365
00:26:33.723 --> 00:26:37.193
Well, we're so close to
the park. Why not try that?


366
00:26:37.226 --> 00:26:39.996
Many of the doctor's patients
find it very relaxing.


367
00:27:00.316 --> 00:27:02.184
If it isn't Our Lady
of the Stairways.


368
00:27:02.218 --> 00:27:04.754
Hello, David.

369
00:27:04.787 --> 00:27:05.922
Why did you
run away from me?


370
00:27:05.955 --> 00:27:08.057
I wanted to talk to you.

371
00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:11.127
What did you want to say?

372
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:14.230
Tell you how sorry I was
that I frightened you.


373
00:27:14.263 --> 00:27:17.033
You're still
frightening me, David.


374
00:27:17.066 --> 00:27:19.936
Where did you go?

375
00:27:19.969 --> 00:27:22.839
I just ran.
I followed you.


376
00:27:22.872 --> 00:27:24.807
And I called.
Didn't you hear me?


377
00:27:24.841 --> 00:27:26.709
I heard you.

378
00:27:26.743 --> 00:27:28.945
I followed you down
four flights of stairs,


379
00:27:28.978 --> 00:27:31.147
but I couldn't find them
when the lights came back on.


380
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:34.216
I think you're mistaken.

381
00:27:36.853 --> 00:27:39.722
Someone's gone to
a great deal of trouble
to make me think so, too.


382
00:27:46.462 --> 00:27:48.998
Are you following me?

383
00:27:49.031 --> 00:27:52.368
Not at the moment.
You're following me.


384
00:27:52.401 --> 00:27:54.737
What did the police say?

385
00:27:57.239 --> 00:27:59.441
Nothing.

386
00:27:59.475 --> 00:28:02.444
You left this
in the phone booth.


387
00:28:02.478 --> 00:28:06.248
You can have it. It's
uh... "eminently readable."


388
00:28:06.282 --> 00:28:08.885
I don't need my head
examined, David.


389
00:28:08.918 --> 00:28:11.788
You read that wrong.
"Don't need my head
examined, David."


390
00:28:14.023 --> 00:28:16.258
Who did you call?

391
00:28:16.292 --> 00:28:18.761
Whom!
Objective case.


392
00:28:18.795 --> 00:28:21.130
There's my trouble right there.
I never could be...


393
00:28:21.163 --> 00:28:23.966
very objective.

394
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.135
Have you got
something to tell me?


395
00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.149
And you only
wanted to look.


396
00:28:40.182 --> 00:28:42.118
The way
you're looking at him.


397
00:28:42.151 --> 00:28:44.320
We both seem to be
having pronoun trouble.


398
00:28:44.353 --> 00:28:47.156
It's a "her."

399
00:28:47.189 --> 00:28:50.092
I don't usually
make that mistake.


400
00:28:51.861 --> 00:28:55.798
Have you noticed how
they use every inch
of space in the cage?


401
00:28:55.832 --> 00:29:00.502
She's making it
as large as she can.


402
00:29:00.536 --> 00:29:02.071
She's looking for a way out.

403
00:29:03.572 --> 00:29:06.843
No.

404
00:29:06.876 --> 00:29:10.112
Not anymore.
She's just waiting.


405
00:29:11.513 --> 00:29:12.513
For what?

406
00:29:16.919 --> 00:29:18.554
Her keeper.

407
00:29:33.002 --> 00:29:35.002
I really don't know you.
I wish you'd believe that.


408
00:29:36.472 --> 00:29:38.207
I believe it.

409
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.441
Who's the Major?

410
00:29:42.344 --> 00:29:44.424
If you don't know,
my telling you
isn't going to help.


411
00:29:45.581 --> 00:29:47.316
Be careful, David.

412
00:30:03.632 --> 00:30:05.267
I'm Mr. Stillwell.
I called.


413
00:30:05.301 --> 00:30:08.237
Oh. Go right in,
Mr. Stillwell.
Doctor's expecting you.


414
00:30:20.282 --> 00:30:23.986
You won't find a couch,
Mr. Stillwell.


415
00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:27.523
I'm a consulting
psychiatrist,
not an analyst.


416
00:30:27.556 --> 00:30:29.425
Didn't Dr. Ellman
tell you that?


417
00:30:31.293 --> 00:30:33.095
Uh, no, he didn't.

418
00:30:33.129 --> 00:30:34.663
Well, I...

419
00:30:34.696 --> 00:30:38.367
I don't wonder.
Ellman's been dead
for 12 years.


420
00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.004
Yeah, well, maybe
that's why he didn't
say very much.


421
00:30:42.038 --> 00:30:43.439
Why did you agree
to see me, then?


422
00:30:43.472 --> 00:30:45.407
Well, why not?

423
00:30:47.043 --> 00:30:49.578
You picked both our names
from that foolish book.


424
00:30:49.611 --> 00:30:52.248
That's the only connection
Ellman and I ever had.


425
00:30:53.382 --> 00:30:55.351
He was a Freudian.

426
00:30:55.384 --> 00:30:58.454
I, on the other hand,
am a genius.


427
00:30:58.487 --> 00:31:02.091
There, you see?
I now longer suppress
my outrageous egotism.


428
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.995
Now, what do you want to know?

429
00:31:12.334 --> 00:31:13.702
Whether or not
I'm insane.


430
00:31:13.735 --> 00:31:18.574
Ah. "Insanity" is
a legal term, you understand.


431
00:31:18.607 --> 00:31:20.576
Not a medical one.

432
00:31:20.609 --> 00:31:23.112
If you know the difference
between right and wrong,


433
00:31:23.145 --> 00:31:25.181
the law considers you sane.

434
00:31:25.214 --> 00:31:28.050
Do you know that difference?
Between right and wrong?


435
00:31:28.084 --> 00:31:30.219
Well, they're hardly
constant factors, doctor.


436
00:31:30.252 --> 00:31:32.554
I can probably give you
five minutes on good and evil.


437
00:31:32.588 --> 00:31:35.257
Now those aren't
legal or medical terms.


438
00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:38.194
"Good" and "evil"
are theological concepts.


439
00:31:38.227 --> 00:31:43.065
The only thing that matters
in psychiatry, Mr. Stillwell,


440
00:31:43.099 --> 00:31:45.267
is behavior.

441
00:31:45.301 --> 00:31:48.937
Could you tell me of
any behavior which might make
you doubt your rationality?


442
00:31:50.672 --> 00:31:53.575
Well, among other things,

443
00:31:53.609 --> 00:31:56.345
I've walked down four flights
of stairs which weren't there.


444
00:31:56.378 --> 00:31:59.748
Good, marvelous!

445
00:31:59.781 --> 00:32:01.517
Had you been drinking?
No.


446
00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.319
Taking drugs?
No.


447
00:32:03.352 --> 00:32:07.123
Ah! Then, either
the stairs were there,


448
00:32:07.156 --> 00:32:09.725
or you didn't walk
down them... you see my point?


449
00:32:09.758 --> 00:32:12.194
Vividly.

450
00:32:12.228 --> 00:32:14.997
Tell me something,
Mr. Stillwell.


451
00:32:15.031 --> 00:32:18.300
Why did you have
to look through a book
to find a psychiatrist?


452
00:32:18.334 --> 00:32:20.469
Why didn't you ask
your regular doctor?


453
00:32:22.538 --> 00:32:24.040
No, I don't have a doctor.

454
00:32:24.073 --> 00:32:27.443
Oh? Well, you could have
asked a friend, certainly.


455
00:32:27.476 --> 00:32:29.045
You have friends, I presume?

456
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.117
Well, everyone has friends,
Mr. Stillwell.


457
00:32:37.653 --> 00:32:40.489
I think you'd better tell me
something about yourself.


458
00:32:40.522 --> 00:32:42.458
It isn't every day I meet
a man with no friends.


459
00:32:44.593 --> 00:32:46.262
What would you like to know?

460
00:32:46.295 --> 00:32:50.166
Well, who you are, what you do,
where you come from.


461
00:32:50.199 --> 00:32:51.233
Date and place of birth?

462
00:32:54.536 --> 00:32:57.606
Well, Mr. Stillwell?

463
00:33:04.113 --> 00:33:08.250
There are some things
that this, uh, data
processing can't help.


464
00:33:08.284 --> 00:33:10.586
Why are you afraid of
questions, Mr. Stillwell?


465
00:33:10.619 --> 00:33:13.255
Police wouldn't help me
either, unless I answered
all of theirs.


466
00:33:13.289 --> 00:33:17.526
The police? Then
the trouble isn't totally
in the mind, is it?


467
00:33:17.559 --> 00:33:19.395
Now what do you do,
Mr. Stillwell?


468
00:33:19.428 --> 00:33:22.198
Cost accounting.
Oh, why is that?


469
00:33:22.231 --> 00:33:23.599
Why not?

470
00:33:23.632 --> 00:33:26.168
I ask you why,
and you ask me why not.


471
00:33:26.202 --> 00:33:29.705
Philosophical, perhaps,
but hardly productive.


472
00:33:29.738 --> 00:33:33.075
There are many reasons
why I can't think of you
as a cost accountant.


473
00:33:33.109 --> 00:33:36.112
So I'm curious as to how
and when you became one.


474
00:33:36.145 --> 00:33:38.280
It was two years ago.

475
00:33:38.314 --> 00:33:41.317
I went to
Garrison, Ltd., downtown
in the Unidyne Building.


476
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.520
I was interviewed
by a Mr. Josephson, and
he found me acceptable.


477
00:33:44.553 --> 00:33:47.656
What did you do before that?

478
00:33:47.689 --> 00:33:50.359
I don't know!

479
00:33:50.392 --> 00:33:52.394
I don't think I understand.

480
00:33:52.428 --> 00:33:56.132
You don't know what you were
doing two years ago?


481
00:33:56.165 --> 00:33:59.568
Yeah. I haven't thought
much about it. Lately...


482
00:33:59.601 --> 00:34:01.703
Oh, now, now, now,
come, Mr. Stillwell.


483
00:34:01.737 --> 00:34:05.141
Two years isn't
such a long time.


484
00:34:05.174 --> 00:34:08.810
Uh, what were you doing
the day before you got the job?


485
00:34:08.844 --> 00:34:11.880
- I don't know.
- The week before, then.


486
00:34:11.913 --> 00:34:15.351
- I don't know.
- The year before!


487
00:34:15.384 --> 00:34:19.121
I can't remember.

488
00:34:19.155 --> 00:34:22.591
I see. Why didn't you come
right out and say so
in the first place?


489
00:34:25.294 --> 00:34:29.198
Well, I... I don't think
that I actually...


490
00:34:29.231 --> 00:34:31.433
realized it
until just now.


491
00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:34.836
Are you trying to tell me
you've been suffering from
amnesia for two years,


492
00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:38.507
and never suspected that fact
until this very minute?


493
00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.176
Yeah.

494
00:34:40.209 --> 00:34:43.412
Yes, it rather looks
that way, doesn't it?


495
00:34:43.445 --> 00:34:45.690
Well, I'm sorry,
doctor. I don't like it
any more than you do.


496
00:34:45.714 --> 00:34:49.818
Mr. Stillwell,
I'd appreciate it if
you'd leave my office.


497
00:34:49.851 --> 00:34:52.888
Right now!
Well, wha... what?


498
00:34:52.921 --> 00:34:55.691
What is this, some sort
of a new shock treatment?


499
00:34:55.724 --> 00:34:58.460
It's good-bye treatment,
Mr. Stillwell.


500
00:34:58.494 --> 00:35:01.563
I don't know what
your game is, and I'm
not very anxious to play.


501
00:35:01.597 --> 00:35:04.266
You're obviously in some sort
of trouble with the police,


502
00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.278
and you've come to me
to establish a tricky defense!


503
00:35:06.302 --> 00:35:08.337
Now just a minute.
Will you please just...


504
00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.907
There is no such thing
as the sort of amnesia
you describe.


505
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:13.942
There never has been,
and there never will be.


506
00:35:13.975 --> 00:35:15.577
Surely in some cases...
Never!


507
00:35:18.414 --> 00:35:22.618
Unconscious amnesia can
exist for an hour or two.


508
00:35:22.651 --> 00:35:24.920
Sometimes, on rare
occasions, a day or two.


509
00:35:24.953 --> 00:35:28.357
But two years?
Impossible!


510
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:32.461
Uh... will you please listen?
I'm through listening!


511
00:35:32.494 --> 00:35:36.432
You come recommended
by a dead man, and
you invent amnesia.


512
00:35:36.465 --> 00:35:39.801
Well, I'm not going
to help you trick
the police or anyone else.


513
00:35:39.835 --> 00:35:41.470
Now, good-bye.

514
00:35:50.512 --> 00:35:52.614
Save your money,
Mr. Stillwell.


515
00:35:52.648 --> 00:35:54.683
If that's your name.

516
00:35:54.716 --> 00:35:56.652
You'll be needing
a lawyer now.


517
00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:02.624
To hell with you, Doctor.

518
00:36:09.765 --> 00:36:12.200
To hell with you too,
Mr. Stillwell.


519
00:36:24.045 --> 00:36:26.648
Now, what were you doing
the day before you got the job?


520
00:36:29.418 --> 00:36:32.554
Or the week before, then?

521
00:36:32.588 --> 00:36:33.588
The year before?

522
00:36:36.758 --> 00:36:41.363
It isn't every day
I meet a man with no friends.


523
00:37:27.343 --> 00:37:29.478
Yeah?

524
00:37:30.779 --> 00:37:33.482
Yes, sir?
AAA Detective Agency?


525
00:37:33.515 --> 00:37:36.585
Triple-A, that's right.
Puts me first
in the yellow pages.


526
00:37:36.618 --> 00:37:39.655
Until somebody comes along
with four A's, anyway.


527
00:37:39.688 --> 00:37:41.490
You're sellin' something?

528
00:37:41.523 --> 00:37:43.859
No. You are.

529
00:37:43.892 --> 00:37:47.529
Oh!

530
00:37:47.563 --> 00:37:49.698
You want any?
Can we talk about it?


531
00:37:49.731 --> 00:37:52.067
Sure, sure.
Come on in.


532
00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.602
The secretary's
out to lunch,


533
00:37:53.635 --> 00:37:56.538
and my partner's on a case...
My name is Caselle.


534
00:37:56.572 --> 00:37:59.975
Who recommended you
to this office, Mr...
Stillwell. David Stillwell.


535
00:38:00.008 --> 00:38:03.712
I saw the sign.
Oh! Sit down.
Sit down, please.


536
00:38:06.114 --> 00:38:08.884
Like a smoke?
No thanks.


537
00:38:08.917 --> 00:38:10.686
Now then, sir.
What can I do for ya?


538
00:38:12.153 --> 00:38:14.723
For openers, you can
find out who I am.


539
00:38:14.756 --> 00:38:17.626
Sure.
You're David Stillwell.


540
00:38:17.659 --> 00:38:19.761
That'll be uh, ten bucks.

541
00:38:19.795 --> 00:38:21.038
Maybe I'd better
wait for your partner.


542
00:38:21.062 --> 00:38:22.864
Now wait a minute.
Relax, Mr. Stillwell.


543
00:38:22.898 --> 00:38:26.101
That's what is known
as "breaking the ice."


544
00:38:26.134 --> 00:38:29.405
Well, I don't want a date,
Mr. Caselle. I need some help.


545
00:38:29.438 --> 00:38:30.939
I'm willing to pay in advance.

546
00:38:30.972 --> 00:38:32.808
Cash?

547
00:38:32.841 --> 00:38:35.744
What else? A sack of flour
and some colored beads?


548
00:38:35.777 --> 00:38:37.846
I don't take
any postdated checks.


549
00:38:37.879 --> 00:38:41.817
How much?

550
00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:45.521
Five hundred dollars,
plus 25 a day expenses?


551
00:38:45.554 --> 00:38:49.625
We'll have to go to my bank.
What are we dawdling
around here for?


552
00:38:49.658 --> 00:38:51.760
But... Don't you want
to hear about it first?


553
00:38:51.793 --> 00:38:54.095
Sure, in the taxi.

554
00:38:54.129 --> 00:38:57.065
Well, uh... What
about your secretary?
Don't you want to


555
00:38:57.098 --> 00:38:59.067
leave her a note?
Or something?


556
00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.737
I'll tell you the truth,
Stillwell. I don't have
a secretary.


557
00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:03.772
There isn't
any partner, either.


558
00:39:03.805 --> 00:39:06.742
As a matter of fact,
sir, you're my first case.


559
00:39:08.577 --> 00:39:10.045
Terrific.

560
00:39:13.148 --> 00:39:15.951
One hundred,

561
00:39:15.984 --> 00:39:20.722
55, 50, 70, 90...

562
00:39:20.756 --> 00:39:21.757
Thank you, Mr. Stillwell.

563
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.902
Five hundred, plus 50
for two days' expenses.


564
00:39:33.935 --> 00:39:35.771
I think you better keep it.
The deal's off.


565
00:39:37.773 --> 00:39:40.442
What happened to you?

566
00:39:40.476 --> 00:39:42.520
I been thinkin'
about what you told me.
I been trying to decide


567
00:39:42.544 --> 00:39:45.080
whether you're lying
or you're just crazy.


568
00:39:45.113 --> 00:39:46.782
That cabbage there
tells me you're crazy,


569
00:39:46.815 --> 00:39:47.983
so I can't help ya.

570
00:39:51.019 --> 00:39:55.156
Listen, Caselle.

571
00:39:55.190 --> 00:40:00.796
For the past two years...
I've been completely alone.


572
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:03.565
Eating alone, spending
my nights and weekends alone,


573
00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:06.702
and I never questioned it.

574
00:40:06.735 --> 00:40:08.604
Not once
in two years.


575
00:40:10.205 --> 00:40:12.608
I have to know why.

576
00:40:17.012 --> 00:40:19.652
Make listening noises,
will ya? Nod your head
or grunt or something?


577
00:40:23.585 --> 00:40:25.487
All right.
Give me the money.


578
00:40:25.521 --> 00:40:28.023
I'll earn this.
I got a sneaky feeling,


579
00:40:28.056 --> 00:40:30.959
even if I don't do anything,
I'll still earn it.


580
00:40:30.992 --> 00:40:35.797
Here. I'll take
half of that. I'm not
in the 5-C class yet.


581
00:40:35.831 --> 00:40:38.600
Incredible, the way
you fill a man
with confidence.


582
00:40:38.634 --> 00:40:39.801
Come on.
A deal's a deal.


583
00:40:41.637 --> 00:40:43.047
Considering that
I'm your first case,


584
00:40:43.071 --> 00:40:44.816
maybe you'd like me
to have the money framed!


585
00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.709
Don't bother.
I'm hungrier than
I am sentimental.


586
00:40:47.743 --> 00:40:50.078
Where should we start?
Your place.


587
00:40:50.111 --> 00:40:51.656
We ought to be able to
tell something about you,


588
00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.815
just from seein'
the way you live.


589
00:40:53.849 --> 00:40:56.051
You know, when I was
repairing refrigerators,


590
00:40:56.084 --> 00:40:58.286
I found out that I could
read a man's character


591
00:40:58.319 --> 00:41:00.231
pretty well, just by
seeing what he's got
in his icebox.


592
00:41:03.058 --> 00:41:06.094
What's so funny?

593
00:41:06.127 --> 00:41:08.630
Take a look.
My whole life's in there.


594
00:41:13.168 --> 00:41:15.637
Looks like a pretty
full life, if you ask me.


595
00:41:22.043 --> 00:41:24.324
But it was empty,
Caselle. I swear
there was nothing in it.


596
00:41:31.252 --> 00:41:33.855
You could at least look
like you believe me.


597
00:41:33.889 --> 00:41:35.791
I'm tryin', pal.
I'm tryin'.


598
00:41:37.358 --> 00:41:39.628
Hey, what about the stuff
that Chubby left behind?


599
00:41:39.661 --> 00:41:40.929
The, uh,
the hat and the gun.


600
00:41:40.962 --> 00:41:42.898
Can I take
a look at those?


601
00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:51.573
Maybe this is
not your apartment.


602
00:41:52.841 --> 00:41:56.111
Nice try.

603
00:41:56.144 --> 00:41:58.647
I tell you one thing,
it's kinda scary.


604
00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:02.217
You don't even talk
like a detective.


605
00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.620
Hey, Stillwell.

606
00:42:04.653 --> 00:42:07.122
Who else knows
about your amnesia?


607
00:42:07.155 --> 00:42:09.357
No-one, except you
and Dr. Broden.


608
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.059
No-one else?

609
00:42:11.092 --> 00:42:13.061
Well, I just realized
it myself, how could any...


610
00:42:14.395 --> 00:42:16.998
If you really don't know,

611
00:42:17.032 --> 00:42:18.667
my telling you
isn't going to help.


612
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:23.939
She knows. The girl
I told you about.


613
00:42:26.107 --> 00:42:28.343
That's why she followed me
today, to make sure.


614
00:42:28.376 --> 00:42:30.254
Yeah, well, if she knows,
then anybody could know...


615
00:42:30.278 --> 00:42:32.848
Including the Major.

616
00:42:32.881 --> 00:42:35.283
What about
your dispatch case?


617
00:42:41.657 --> 00:42:44.693
Well, maybe the brownies
came in during the night.


618
00:42:48.163 --> 00:42:52.067
Well, if this thing
really was empty...
It was empty.


619
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:55.737
The question is, why
did they fill it up again?


620
00:42:57.806 --> 00:43:00.108
Maybe they did it
for my benefit.


621
00:43:00.141 --> 00:43:04.713
what if they
fixed it so's I'm not
supposed to believe you?


622
00:43:04.746 --> 00:43:07.949
What-What if I'm supposed
to write you off as a nut
and walk away?


623
00:43:07.983 --> 00:43:09.927
What if someone wants you
playin' this thing all alone,


624
00:43:09.951 --> 00:43:11.720
without any help?

625
00:43:11.753 --> 00:43:13.188
What if I am a nut?

626
00:43:13.221 --> 00:43:15.032
No, I don't think you're
nuts enough to imagine


627
00:43:15.056 --> 00:43:17.736
that big fellow
that's been following us
ever since we left the bank.


628
00:43:21.329 --> 00:43:23.398
I didn't see anyone.

629
00:43:23.431 --> 00:43:25.433
You're not being paid to.

630
00:43:25.466 --> 00:43:29.037
Wouldn't it be hilarious
if you did know
what you're doing?


631
00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:31.439
Yeah. Then how come
I don't know what to do next?


632
00:43:31.472 --> 00:43:33.341
Well, uh...
Pretend your James Bond.


633
00:43:33.374 --> 00:43:35.452
He always knows.
Hey, maybe we ought
to get something to eat.


634
00:43:35.476 --> 00:43:37.879
I'm dyin' for
a peanut butter sandwich.


635
00:43:37.913 --> 00:43:40.281
Forget James Bond.
Then we could take a look
at your office.


636
00:43:40.315 --> 00:43:42.217
What's the name
of that place?


637
00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:44.385
Garrison, Limited.

638
00:43:44.419 --> 00:43:47.355
I'm beginning to
wish I had a gun.


639
00:43:47.388 --> 00:43:50.726
You're kidding!
Ah, the filthy things,
I can't stand 'em.


640
00:43:50.759 --> 00:43:53.328
You have one,
and sure as shootin, '
you end up usin' it.


641
00:43:55.096 --> 00:43:56.732
Beautiful.

642
00:43:59.968 --> 00:44:01.870
Well, it's just
around the corner.


643
00:44:07.776 --> 00:44:11.212
Hey!
Charles Calvin?


644
00:44:11.246 --> 00:44:14.015
Hey, you didn't tell me
about that?


645
00:44:14.049 --> 00:44:16.017
So?
Did you know Calvin?


646
00:44:16.051 --> 00:44:18.319
No!
What do you think
happened to him?


647
00:44:18.353 --> 00:44:20.898
Look, you can start
on his case as soon as
you're finished with mine.


648
00:44:20.922 --> 00:44:22.991
Do you want to see
my office or not?
Okay! Okay.


649
00:44:39.374 --> 00:44:42.443
Right there, huh?
Yeah.


650
00:44:42.477 --> 00:44:44.789
That wall doesn't
look like it was built
recently, Stillwell.


651
00:44:44.813 --> 00:44:46.748
Looks like it's been
there a long time.


652
00:44:46.782 --> 00:44:49.662
I tell ya, there was a door
there. I passed through it
thousands of times.


653
00:44:50.986 --> 00:44:52.754
Take is easy.
Take it easy, will ya?


654
00:44:52.788 --> 00:44:54.856
Are you sure you got
the right floor?
Yes, I'm sure.


655
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.225
Somebody's changed it.
Why?


656
00:44:57.258 --> 00:44:59.394
I don't know? What do
you think I hired you for?


657
00:44:59.427 --> 00:45:01.830
Conversation, you said.
Then, let's hear some.


658
00:45:01.863 --> 00:45:04.232
I tell you, there
was an office there.


659
00:45:04.265 --> 00:45:06.367
I worked in it
for two years.


660
00:45:06.401 --> 00:45:08.770
I left it less
than 24 hours ago.


661
00:45:08.804 --> 00:45:10.972
Face it, will ya, Stillwell?
There's no door there,


662
00:45:11.006 --> 00:45:14.976
and there hasn't been one
for a lot longer than 24 hours.


663
00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:17.779
I don't need a detective.
I need a keeper.


664
00:45:17.813 --> 00:45:21.249
You better get out
of here, Caselle. This is
my own private nightmare!


665
00:45:21.282 --> 00:45:25.353
Ah, if I quit now,
I'll start dreamin'
about it myself.


666
00:45:25.386 --> 00:45:27.164
Come on, let's look into
those four flights of stairs


667
00:45:27.188 --> 00:45:28.957
that aren't there either.

668
00:45:47.075 --> 00:45:49.010
Here.

669
00:45:49.044 --> 00:45:51.512
Where'd you meet
that maintenance man?
Right through there.


670
00:45:51.546 --> 00:45:54.049
Tell me some more about him.

671
00:45:54.082 --> 00:45:56.952
Well, he wore...
steel-rim glasses.


672
00:45:56.985 --> 00:46:00.521
He weighed about...
The man who's been following us
wears steel-rim glasses.


673
00:46:39.294 --> 00:46:42.130
Yo! Stillwell!
Stand over there.


674
00:46:44.565 --> 00:46:47.235
I'm jumpin' off to the left,
you go off the other side.


675
00:46:47.268 --> 00:46:48.603
I said "Move!"
Go!


676
00:46:55.376 --> 00:46:57.245
For God's sakes,
Stillwell, jump!


677
00:48:03.011 --> 00:48:04.946
Why didn't you jump?

678
00:48:07.182 --> 00:48:09.717
this is no private nightmare.

679
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:12.087
This guy is real.
And so is this gun.


680
00:48:17.192 --> 00:48:18.659
Let's see what else
he's carryin'.


681
00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:29.604
What do you you
think that means?

?? [sinister]

683

Mind if I keep it?
No, no. I don't mind.


684
00:48:52.793 --> 00:48:54.762
He's not objecting either.
Let's get out of here


685
00:48:54.795 --> 00:48:56.597
before he does.

686
00:49:05.673 --> 00:49:07.775
Turtle.
Where?


687
00:49:07.808 --> 00:49:10.011
Joe Turtle.

688
00:49:10.045 --> 00:49:12.613
Peter Cottontail.

689
00:49:12.647 --> 00:49:16.451
No. That man over there.
His name is Joe Turtle.


690
00:49:16.484 --> 00:49:18.686
You know, every time
I decide you're sane,


691
00:49:18.719 --> 00:49:20.688
you come up with
something like that.


692
00:49:20.721 --> 00:49:22.690
He knows me.
He knows I work here.


693
00:49:22.723 --> 00:49:24.659
Joe?

694
00:49:31.666 --> 00:49:33.768
Could you use a drink?
Easy.

Good evening.

Thank you.

Uh, I'll have
a Dr. Pepper.


699
00:49:50.585 --> 00:49:52.687
That figures.

700
00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.223
Stillwell, what does
a cost accountant do?


701
00:49:55.256 --> 00:49:58.126
I don't know.

702
00:49:58.159 --> 00:50:01.062
There are many reasons
why I can't think of you
as a cost accountant.


703
00:50:04.165 --> 00:50:05.765
I don't know what
a cost accountant does.


704
00:50:08.736 --> 00:50:09.776
Haven't the faintest idea.

705
00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.542
You don't look
very surprised.


706
00:50:14.575 --> 00:50:17.478
Why? Because for
the past two years,


707
00:50:17.512 --> 00:50:19.456
you've been doing something
you don't know anything about


708
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:21.282
in an office
that doesn't exist?


709
00:50:21.316 --> 00:50:23.551
What's there to be
surprised about?


710
00:50:28.523 --> 00:50:29.524
Thank you.

711
00:50:29.557 --> 00:50:31.392
Now what do we do now?

712
00:50:31.426 --> 00:50:33.428
Start diggin'.

713
00:50:33.461 --> 00:50:36.231
I'm kind of curious
about Charles Calvin,
for instance,


714
00:50:36.264 --> 00:50:37.732
and why he went
through that window.


715
00:50:37.765 --> 00:50:39.834
Why Calvin?
I didn't even know him.


716
00:50:39.867 --> 00:50:44.272
Maybe not. But your nightmare
began at almost the exact moment


717
00:50:44.305 --> 00:50:46.341
his ended.

718
00:50:46.374 --> 00:50:49.144
No, wasting your time.

719
00:50:49.177 --> 00:50:51.546
I don't mind.
You're payin' for it.


720
00:50:51.579 --> 00:50:52.823
And listen, while
I'm getting rich,


721
00:50:52.847 --> 00:50:55.150
you can go and find
Joe, um, Turtle,


722
00:50:55.183 --> 00:50:57.485
or whatever his name is.

723
00:50:57.518 --> 00:50:59.487
Well, suppose
he's a dream too?


724
00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.332
Never mind. Just find him.
And call me in my office


725
00:51:01.356 --> 00:51:03.391
in about two hours, huh?

726
00:51:27.815 --> 00:51:29.450
Would you...
like to have a drink?


727
00:51:29.484 --> 00:51:30.551
No.

728
00:51:31.786 --> 00:51:33.554
Then let's go.

it's the city's fault?

to people, what
it does to them...

to themselves?

Mm-hmm.

You'd think that I'd remember
someone like you


741
00:52:23.938 --> 00:52:25.606
You'd think.

00:52:41.956 --> 00:52:47.262
Gracefully. You were
much too polite
to call me names.


746
00:52:47.295 --> 00:52:49.497
Did you deserve them?

747
00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:51.799
I'd just as soon
you didn't remember.


748
00:52:51.832 --> 00:52:55.270
I can't remember anything.
Yes, I know.


749
00:52:55.303 --> 00:52:59.307
Shela, do you know
a man named Joe Turtle?


750
00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.309
No more questions, David.
Why?


751
00:53:01.342 --> 00:53:03.354
What do you think
would happen if you
told me something?


752
00:53:03.378 --> 00:53:05.780
You'd turn into a frog?
Let's not take the chance.


753
00:53:05.813 --> 00:53:07.682
Shela! Who are you?

754
00:53:07.715 --> 00:53:09.584
You've forgotten how
to be polite, too.


755
00:53:11.352 --> 00:53:13.521
David! Give it
to me, please!


756
00:53:13.554 --> 00:53:15.290
Shela... I don't know
who I am.


757
00:53:15.323 --> 00:53:18.025
I don't know who
you are, or who
the Major is!


758
00:53:18.058 --> 00:53:19.860
I'm confused
and frightened.


759
00:53:19.894 --> 00:53:21.829
Mustn't be upset when
I do things you don't like,


760
00:53:21.862 --> 00:53:22.902
even if you do say please.

761
00:53:35.443 --> 00:53:37.378
You belong to
the Major, don't you?


762
00:53:39.847 --> 00:53:41.649
People don't belong
to people, David.


763
00:53:41.682 --> 00:53:43.751
They go quietly,
on their own.


764
00:53:43.784 --> 00:53:47.388
Shela, you've got
to tell me who he is,


765
00:53:47.422 --> 00:53:48.823
and what he wants!

766
00:53:48.856 --> 00:53:50.758
He can't have it
both ways!


767
00:53:50.791 --> 00:53:52.903
How can I give him
anything if I can't
remember what it is?


768
00:53:52.927 --> 00:53:54.938
Be grateful for that.
Not remembering is
the only thing


769
00:53:54.962 --> 00:53:57.064
that's keeping you alive!
But why?


770
00:53:57.097 --> 00:53:59.300
Because...

771
00:53:59.334 --> 00:54:02.470
you know something
you shouldn't about him.


772
00:54:02.503 --> 00:54:07.342
But also, you have
something he needs.


773
00:54:07.375 --> 00:54:09.877
That's why
he's taking a chance...


774
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:12.313
on keeping you alive
a little longer.


775
00:54:12.347 --> 00:54:16.984
Have to write him
a thank you note.


776
00:54:17.017 --> 00:54:19.954
That's why you're
here, isn't it?


777
00:54:19.987 --> 00:54:23.691
You're riding scout,
keeping tabs on my progress.


778
00:54:23.724 --> 00:54:25.560
All right, Major,
as of 7:30 tonight,


779
00:54:25.593 --> 00:54:27.795
he's still a vegetable.
I don't want you killed!


780
00:54:27.828 --> 00:54:30.297
Oh yes, of course,
you're doing it all for me.


781
00:54:32.533 --> 00:54:35.403
And when I remember...

782
00:54:35.436 --> 00:54:37.596
what will you do for me then,
when the shooting starts?


783
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.475
Stand in front of you.

784
00:54:47.782 --> 00:54:50.385
Shela, help me now!
Now!


785
00:54:50.418 --> 00:54:52.920
But how can I?
Help me find Joe Turtle.


786
00:54:52.953 --> 00:54:54.731
He knows me.
He knows where I work.
But for God's sake, David,


787
00:54:54.755 --> 00:54:57.124
leave him alone!

788
00:54:57.157 --> 00:54:59.860
Look, what-what
good will knowing do
you if you're dead?


789
00:54:59.894 --> 00:55:01.796
Is this any different
from being dead?


790
00:55:08.102 --> 00:55:11.572
All right, David.
I'll take you where
you want to go.


791
00:55:26.554 --> 00:55:28.723
Incubator.

792
00:55:30.791 --> 00:55:33.561
Have you lived here?

793
00:55:33.594 --> 00:55:35.274
Name of the street's
different, that's all.


794
00:55:36.831 --> 00:55:38.165
It's right in there.

795
00:55:38.198 --> 00:55:39.934
I'll wait here
for you.


796
00:56:04.725 --> 00:56:05.926
It's open.

797
00:56:10.097 --> 00:56:12.433
Mr. Turtle?

798
00:56:12.467 --> 00:56:15.402
Now isn't that the silliest
name you ever heard?


799
00:56:21.942 --> 00:56:24.545
You hit too hard,
Mr. Stillwell.


800
00:56:24.579 --> 00:56:28.082
I'm gonna have
quite a dentist bill
because of you.


801
00:56:28.115 --> 00:56:29.116
See that?

802
00:56:29.149 --> 00:56:30.951
Where's Joe Turtle?

803
00:56:30.985 --> 00:56:33.488
Search me.

804
00:56:33.521 --> 00:56:36.491
But there's no point
in both of us waiting
for him, is there?


805
00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:40.070
So I'll just
run along now.
What's Turtle got to do...


806
00:56:40.094 --> 00:56:41.596
Stay away from me,
Stillwell!


807
00:56:41.629 --> 00:56:42.930
If you touch me
again, I'll...


808
00:56:47.267 --> 00:56:49.003
Isn't temper
an awful thing?


809
00:56:51.138 --> 00:56:53.240
If, uh, you get bored
waiting, Mr. Stillwell,


810
00:56:53.273 --> 00:56:55.476
try the bed...
Not bad.


811
00:56:59.246 --> 00:57:01.482
Better take this.
You might need it.


812
00:57:04.251 --> 00:57:05.686
Be good now.

813
00:57:38.018 --> 00:57:39.796
What if someone wants you
playing this thing all alone,


814
00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:41.756
without any help?

815
00:57:47.695 --> 00:57:49.630
David?

816
00:57:54.334 --> 00:57:56.671
You knew he was dead.

817
00:57:56.704 --> 00:57:58.773
Why didn't you say so?

818
00:57:58.806 --> 00:58:01.642
You said you were
the same as dead.


819
00:58:01.676 --> 00:58:03.811
But you're not, David!

820
00:58:03.844 --> 00:58:05.913
The way he is,
that's what dead is,


821
00:58:05.946 --> 00:58:07.691
and that's what you'll
look like if you don't stop!


822
00:58:07.715 --> 00:58:10.951
All right.
I've seen it.


823
00:58:10.985 --> 00:58:12.853
But you haven't, Shela.
Come on take a look.


824
00:58:12.887 --> 00:58:15.065
The police are coming!
That's why I came up...
No, come on and look.


825
00:58:15.089 --> 00:58:17.692
I want you to see a portrait
of the man you belong to:


826
00:58:17.725 --> 00:58:18.969
"By the work,
you know the artist."


827
00:58:18.993 --> 00:58:20.728
We've got to get out
of here!
I said, a look!


828
00:58:20.761 --> 00:58:23.097
Oh, no David, please!

829
00:58:23.130 --> 00:58:25.600
That thing in there
used to be somebody.


830
00:58:25.633 --> 00:58:27.134
Somebody who wasn't
any part of this,


831
00:58:27.167 --> 00:58:29.604
except that he knew me
and would have said so.
David!


832
00:58:29.637 --> 00:58:31.939
He probably didn't
even know why it was
happening to him!


833
00:58:31.972 --> 00:58:34.274
You did it!
There was nothing
I could do to stop it!


834
00:58:34.308 --> 00:58:36.644
David, the police!
Please...


835
00:58:36.677 --> 00:58:37.344
I said, look!

836
00:58:37.377 --> 00:58:40.314
No, please!

837
00:58:40.347 --> 00:58:42.883
Now, look.

838
00:58:42.917 --> 00:58:45.620
Ohh...

839
00:58:48.255 --> 00:58:51.158
Where is he?
Where's the Major?


840
00:58:51.191 --> 00:58:54.228
Where is he?
The police.
They'll find you here.


841
00:58:54.261 --> 00:58:56.864
You'll never be able to explain.
That's what he wants!


842
00:58:56.897 --> 00:58:59.033
He wants!
Isn't that what you wanted?


843
00:58:59.066 --> 00:59:01.168
You brought me here.
You set me up.


844
00:59:01.201 --> 00:59:03.270
I could have left.
I didn't have
to come up here.


845
00:59:17.752 --> 00:59:19.086
Right up there.

846
00:59:35.135 --> 00:59:37.638
Yes?

847
00:59:37.672 --> 00:59:39.883
There's been some trouble
downstairs. We had nothing
to do with it...


848
00:59:39.907 --> 00:59:42.176
I can't see or hear
anything, mister.
I'm deaf and blind.


849
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.077
Where are your
mother and father?


850
01:00:07.101 --> 01:00:08.703
Working.

851
01:00:10.237 --> 01:00:11.038
What's your name?

852
01:00:11.071 --> 01:00:13.373
Irene.

853
01:00:32.059 --> 01:00:33.804
Trouble downstairs, ma'am.
You hear anything?


854
01:00:33.828 --> 01:00:35.148
Sorry, I'm deaf and blind.

855
01:00:41.435 --> 01:00:44.805
Oh, God. It was stupid
to bring you here.


856
01:00:44.839 --> 01:00:46.216
I should have known
what he wanted to do.


857
01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.008
That's why he let me come.

858
01:00:48.042 --> 01:00:49.844
Why would
he want me arrested?


859
01:00:49.877 --> 01:00:51.755
Because he knows you couldn't
explain your way out,


860
01:00:51.779 --> 01:00:53.981
that you'd have to go
to him for help.


861
01:00:54.014 --> 01:00:55.215
Mm.

862
01:00:55.249 --> 01:00:57.384
Then I'd belong
to him, too.


863
01:01:00.487 --> 01:01:02.689
Is that how it was
with you?


864
01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:10.965
Were you in trouble?

865
01:01:10.998 --> 01:01:13.100
Is that how
you got to him?


866
01:01:13.133 --> 01:01:16.336
A smart girl like me?

867
01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:18.405
I found the way
all by myself.


868
01:01:34.054 --> 01:01:35.856
Coffee?

869
01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:37.367
Well, you shouldn't
have bothered, Irene.


870
01:01:37.391 --> 01:01:39.093
Glad she did.

871
01:01:39.126 --> 01:01:40.394
I could use it.

872
01:01:49.937 --> 01:01:51.105
Thank you.

873
01:01:59.179 --> 01:02:01.015
Thank you.

874
01:02:01.048 --> 01:02:04.184
Where did you learn
to make such good coffee?


875
01:02:04.218 --> 01:02:07.354
On television.
It's the best coffee
I ever tasted.


876
01:02:07.387 --> 01:02:10.490
It's "coffeeier coffee."
Aren't you having any?


877
01:02:10.524 --> 01:02:12.793
I'm too young
to drink coffee.


878
01:02:12.827 --> 01:02:14.795
That's right.

879
01:02:16.997 --> 01:02:18.398
Have you ever
been married, Shela?


880
01:02:18.432 --> 01:02:20.467
I don't know.
Does playing house count?


881
01:02:22.002 --> 01:02:24.504
Depends on
how old you were.


882
01:02:24.538 --> 01:02:25.906
About her age.

883
01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.074
Doesn't count.

884
01:02:28.375 --> 01:02:29.977
Maybe a little older.

885
01:02:38.953 --> 01:02:43.057
Well, I think
we'd better be going.


886
01:02:45.592 --> 01:02:47.494
Getting a little sleepy now?
Mm.


887
01:02:47.527 --> 01:02:50.597
Irene...
What are you doing?


888
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:52.175
Well, thought I'd give
her a little something.


889
01:02:52.199 --> 01:02:53.567
Tip, you mean?

890
01:02:54.969 --> 01:02:56.236
Gratitude.

891
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:57.337
Then say thank you.

892
01:02:59.039 --> 01:03:00.039
All right.

893
01:03:01.641 --> 01:03:04.511
Thank you, Irene.
You're welcome.


894
01:03:04.544 --> 01:03:06.580
Okay, young lady,
today is all over with.


895
01:03:11.919 --> 01:03:13.353
Let's take your shoes off.

896
01:03:17.491 --> 01:03:20.194
Come on, silly.
Crawl into bed, now.


897
01:03:28.903 --> 01:03:30.604
David, don't answer it.

898
01:03:32.506 --> 01:03:35.342
Hello?

899
01:03:35.375 --> 01:03:37.144
Hello?

900
01:03:37.177 --> 01:03:38.178
Hello?

901
01:03:41.681 --> 01:03:44.985
Probably Caselle.
Not very likely.


902
01:03:45.019 --> 01:03:46.196
I was worried
when you didn't call.


903
01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:48.220
Besides, I don't
get a chance to
work on many locks.


904
01:03:49.389 --> 01:03:52.226
Shela, this is Caselle,
boy detective.


905
01:03:52.259 --> 01:03:53.928
I don't know
his first name.


906
01:03:53.961 --> 01:03:55.495
This is Shela...

907
01:03:55.529 --> 01:03:58.032
I don't know
her last name.


908
01:03:58.065 --> 01:03:59.509
I'm sure the two of you
will be very happy.


909
01:03:59.533 --> 01:04:01.936
Hiya. Ted Caselle.
Glad to meet ya.


910
01:04:01.969 --> 01:04:04.171
Hey, did you find
your friend Turtle?


911
01:04:04.204 --> 01:04:09.276
We found him.
His head was beaten in
by the handle of a pistol.


912
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:11.045
How did you do?

913
01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:17.093
I'll fix some coffee.
You could probably use
the real thing this time.


914
01:04:17.117 --> 01:04:19.053
Right in there.
Yes, I know
where it is.


915
01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:22.389
Hey, Stillwell.

916
01:04:22.422 --> 01:04:26.160
Went to
the 42nd Street Library,
and I looked up Garrison.


917
01:04:26.193 --> 01:04:28.138
Hey, Stillwell.
Are you listening to me?
Yeah. Sorry.


918
01:04:28.162 --> 01:04:31.265
Went to
the 42nd Street Library,
looked up Garrison, Ltd.


919
01:04:31.298 --> 01:04:33.643
No such place.
Not in the whole city.
Not in the whole country.


920
01:04:33.667 --> 01:04:37.504
Never was.
Well, that's crazy.


921
01:04:37.537 --> 01:04:40.274
Who's been paying
my salary every week
for the past two years?


922
01:04:40.307 --> 01:04:43.077
How do I know?
Listen. Have you ever
been to California?


923
01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:45.345
Uh, all you've got
is instant, okay?


924
01:04:45.379 --> 01:04:47.547
Yeah! Instant, fine.

925
01:04:47.581 --> 01:04:49.416
I live in New York.
I work in New York.


926
01:04:49.449 --> 01:04:50.985
Why ask
about California?


927
01:04:59.759 --> 01:05:02.729
Caselle, what
about California?


928
01:05:02.762 --> 01:05:05.665
I found
a "Garrison Laboratories,"


929
01:05:05.699 --> 01:05:07.667
in Brewster, California.

930
01:05:07.701 --> 01:05:09.970
It's part of the Charles Calvin
Peace Foundation.


931
01:05:10.004 --> 01:05:12.706
That's a non-profit organization
dedicated to world peace.


932
01:05:15.342 --> 01:05:17.277
Rings no bell
whatsoever.


933
01:05:17.311 --> 01:05:19.113
No bell, huh?

934
01:05:19.146 --> 01:05:21.048
How about this...

935
01:05:21.081 --> 01:05:24.118
The head of Garrison Labs
is a man named Josephson.


936
01:05:24.151 --> 01:05:28.688
Before taking over at Garrison,
Mr. Sylvester Josephson


937
01:05:28.722 --> 01:05:31.458
was the head of
the Physiochemistry Division


938
01:05:31.491 --> 01:05:33.293
at Unidyne.

939
01:05:34.361 --> 01:05:36.163
Ding-dong?

940
01:05:39.799 --> 01:05:42.469
Detectives don't have
to be funny, Caselle.


941
01:05:42.502 --> 01:05:44.771
No matter what
it says in the handbook.


942
01:05:44.804 --> 01:05:47.674
Can't help it.
I'm excessively
happy-go-lucky.


943
01:05:47.707 --> 01:05:50.477
Well, you better
start practicing some
happy unemployment jokes.


944
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:52.546
I must have come
pretty close, huh?


945
01:05:54.181 --> 01:05:55.649
Now what's that
supposed to mean?


946
01:05:55.682 --> 01:05:59.353
You don't really
want to remember
anything, do you?


947
01:05:59.386 --> 01:06:02.589
Now look, if I want
a psychiatrist, I'll
get one with a diploma.


948
01:06:02.622 --> 01:06:07.027
Okay. Drop around
tomorrow, pal, and
pick up your 500 bucks.


949
01:06:07.061 --> 01:06:10.530
Oh, never mind that.
You earned it.
Earned it?


950
01:06:10.564 --> 01:06:12.066
Doin' what?

951
01:06:12.099 --> 01:06:13.643
I want to tell you
something, Stillwell.


952
01:06:13.667 --> 01:06:15.578
I woulda gone
all the way to the end
of this thing with ya


953
01:06:15.602 --> 01:06:18.205
because you were all alone
and needed help.


954
01:06:18.238 --> 01:06:20.383
But I'm beginning
to think you're
all alone for a reason.


955
01:06:20.407 --> 01:06:22.076
You want to be.

956
01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:23.789
Now, when you get tired
of it, let me know.


957
01:06:25.145 --> 01:06:28.182
No, no. Wait, Caselle.

958
01:06:28.215 --> 01:06:30.417
Uh... Listen
forget what I said.


959
01:06:30.450 --> 01:06:31.685
It's been a rotten day.

960
01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.222
Let's talk it over
in the morning.


961
01:06:35.255 --> 01:06:37.191
Okay.

962
01:06:47.667 --> 01:06:49.136
Where's your friend?

963
01:06:49.169 --> 01:06:50.570
Oh, uh...

964
01:06:50.604 --> 01:06:52.539
He was just
being polite.


965
01:06:52.572 --> 01:06:54.141
Hates instant coffee.

966
01:06:54.174 --> 01:06:56.276
I can't say I blame him.

967
01:06:56.310 --> 01:06:59.113
They might have included
some instant taste
in along with it.


968
01:06:59.146 --> 01:07:04.451
?? [peaceful, romantic]

969
01:07:08.788 --> 01:07:10.424
How many times have
you been here, Shela?


970
01:07:12.192 --> 01:07:13.527
A few.

971
01:07:18.532 --> 01:07:19.733
Hey, you're staring.

972
01:07:22.136 --> 01:07:23.770
Was I in love with you?

973
01:07:23.803 --> 01:07:25.472
Or what?

974
01:07:25.505 --> 01:07:28.108
"Or what," I suppose.

975
01:07:28.142 --> 01:07:30.210
At least
you never said so.


976
01:07:31.511 --> 01:07:33.780
Well, what did
we used to talk about?


977
01:07:33.813 --> 01:07:36.716
The future, sometimes.
And the past.


978
01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:40.454
Wasn't there any present?
Not much.


979
01:07:40.487 --> 01:07:42.422
You're something
of a perfectionist, David,


980
01:07:42.456 --> 01:07:45.559
and our present
wasn't exactly perfect.


981
01:07:45.592 --> 01:07:48.695
Oh, was that my fault?
Mm. Couldn't help
your attitude, I guess,


982
01:07:48.728 --> 01:07:52.599
any more than I could
change what I believed in.


983
01:07:52.632 --> 01:07:56.136
Which was what?
Survival.


984
01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:59.206
You know, better
well-fed than dead?


985
01:07:59.239 --> 01:08:01.775
And my attitude?
Hmm, disapproval.


986
01:08:01.808 --> 01:08:04.178
Indignation,
something like that.


987
01:08:04.211 --> 01:08:06.313
You could look very
stern when you wanted to.


988
01:08:06.346 --> 01:08:09.516
Huh. A stern,
indignant perfectionist.


989
01:08:09.549 --> 01:08:12.428
It sounds awful.
I haven't come to the charming,
amusing, brilliant part yet.


990
01:08:12.452 --> 01:08:14.521
Hardly wait.

991
01:08:14.554 --> 01:08:18.725
Or the stubborn part, either.

992
01:08:18.758 --> 01:08:22.162
Oh, we're a pair of mules,
David, both of us.


993
01:08:22.196 --> 01:08:24.598
The harder we pulled on
each other, the harder


994
01:08:24.631 --> 01:08:27.334
we dug our heels in.

995
01:08:27.367 --> 01:08:29.403
You wanted me to commit
first, without promises,


996
01:08:29.436 --> 01:08:32.206
out of... principle.

997
01:08:32.239 --> 01:08:33.907
I wanted the promises first.

998
01:08:37.277 --> 01:08:40.380
Togetherness is just dandy,
but I'd just as soon
have foreverness.


999
01:08:40.414 --> 01:08:43.183
Is that what you think
you have with the Major?


1000
01:08:43.217 --> 01:08:47.721
The only kind of
foreverness he hands out
is the kind Joe Turtle got.


1001
01:08:47.754 --> 01:08:50.490
Maybe Turtle believed
in survival, too.


1002
01:08:52.259 --> 01:08:53.627
I'm sure he did.

1003
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:56.763
Well, I'm not impressed.

1004
01:08:56.796 --> 01:09:00.567
We were old-fashioned...
Turtle and I...


1005
01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:04.238
We don't exactly
approve of our murderer
tucking you in at night.


1006
01:09:04.271 --> 01:09:07.241
Well, what do you know
about it?


1007
01:09:07.274 --> 01:09:08.842
David, when you're
caught in quicksand,


1008
01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:10.777
you grab the first hand
that's held out to you,


1009
01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:12.612
and maybe you can't see how...

1010
01:09:12.646 --> 01:09:14.781
dirty the hand is, and
maybe you don't care, either.


1011
01:09:14.814 --> 01:09:17.851
And what do you want here?

1012
01:09:17.884 --> 01:09:19.619
Do you really think
that keeping me alive


1013
01:09:19.653 --> 01:09:22.489
will help buy back
your soul?


1014
01:09:24.524 --> 01:09:26.893
Don't you know
why I'm here, David?


1015
01:09:32.699 --> 01:09:34.301
I only know
where you've come from.


1016
01:09:36.903 --> 01:09:40.340
It's not easy to change sides.

1017
01:09:40.374 --> 01:09:41.675
Help me to do it,
please help?


1018
01:09:43.377 --> 01:09:44.711
I can't even help myself.

1019
01:09:46.313 --> 01:09:48.248
Love me, David.

1020
01:09:49.549 --> 01:09:51.485
Promise you'll love me.

1021
01:09:52.552 --> 01:09:54.888
Promise!

1022
01:09:54.921 --> 01:09:57.624
How can I make any promises
when I don't even know
who I am?


1023
01:09:58.692 --> 01:09:59.726
All right, David.

1024
01:09:59.759 --> 01:10:01.528
You don't have to sign anything.

1025
01:10:03.062 --> 01:10:05.332
Let's just say
we're... we're in escrow.


1026
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:19.245
What's wrong?
Don't you want me?


1027
01:10:37.764 --> 01:10:40.266
Shela?

1028
01:10:53.012 --> 01:10:56.950
Love me, David. Promise
you'll love me. Promise.


1029
01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:05.892
Watch your step, please.

1030
01:11:13.567 --> 01:11:15.835
Willard, the alley!

1031
01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:29.082
Go ahead, Mr. Stillwell.
Try it.


1032
01:11:29.115 --> 01:11:32.018
You'll be dead before
you hit the bottom.


1033
01:11:32.051 --> 01:11:35.054
Lester, why don't
we tell the Major
that he tried it anyway?


1034
01:11:35.088 --> 01:11:37.557
Hear that, Mr. Stillwell?

1035
01:11:37.591 --> 01:11:39.759
Even Willard doesn't
like you very much.


1036
01:11:39.793 --> 01:11:41.661
Mr. Stillwell!
Are you all...


1037
01:11:41.695 --> 01:11:42.896
Oh!

1038
01:11:47.834 --> 01:11:49.736
Get out of here
or I'll kill him!


1039
01:11:49.769 --> 01:11:51.104
I'll save you
the trouble.


1040
01:12:58.972 --> 01:13:01.508
Excuse me.

1041
01:13:01.541 --> 01:13:03.977
Excuse me.

1042
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:06.088
Why don't you stand here
while I'm listening
to the traffic report.


1043
01:13:06.112 --> 01:13:08.014
Would you please move?
I'd like to go upstairs.


1044
01:13:08.047 --> 01:13:11.217
You're sure damn snotty.
I'm twice your age.


1045
01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:13.853
And I know a hell of a lot
more that you ever will,


1046
01:13:13.887 --> 01:13:16.055
even if you live
to be my age.


1047
01:13:16.089 --> 01:13:17.824
Which you don't strike me
you ever will.


1048
01:13:17.857 --> 01:13:19.493
Look, I didn't ask
for your references.


1049
01:13:19.526 --> 01:13:20.093
All I want is
for you to move!


1050
01:13:20.126 --> 01:13:21.194
Ahh!

1051
01:13:29.268 --> 01:13:31.538
Caselle?

1052
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:38.778
Caselle.

1053
01:15:02.061 --> 01:15:04.163
We're goin' across
the street, son.


1054
01:15:04.197 --> 01:15:08.001
Both of us.
Don't look so surprised.


1055
01:15:08.034 --> 01:15:10.570
There ain't any social security
in this line of work.


1056
01:15:10.604 --> 01:15:12.572
Git goin'.

1057
01:15:12.606 --> 01:15:14.216
You start something,
and I have to kill you


1058
01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.285
right here on this
street, and that'll cause
a heap of trouble for me.


1059
01:15:16.309 --> 01:15:19.979
Suppose I don't care.
You care.


1060
01:15:20.013 --> 01:15:22.982
If I'm still scratchin' around
to keep alive at my age,


1061
01:15:23.016 --> 01:15:25.351
I figure you care
a lot at yours.


1062
01:15:25.384 --> 01:15:27.162
Besides, you wouldn't want
to cause no trouble


1063
01:15:27.186 --> 01:15:29.956
for one of our
senior citizens,
would you, son?


1064
01:15:43.670 --> 01:15:45.371
We'll wait right here.

1065
01:15:45.404 --> 01:15:48.241
Willard'll be along with
the car pretty soon now.


1066
01:15:48.274 --> 01:15:50.977
All right, men.

1067
01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:53.346
See that tall fellow there
with yellow leaves?


1068
01:15:53.379 --> 01:15:55.248
Yes!
Who do you think he is?


1069
01:15:55.281 --> 01:15:56.683
Cottonwood?

1070
01:15:56.716 --> 01:15:57.951
Excellent reasoning, Harold.

1071
01:15:57.984 --> 01:16:00.186
But unfortunately,
you're very much mistaken.


1072
01:16:00.219 --> 01:16:03.657
This is our
old friend, the Ginkgo.


1073
01:16:03.690 --> 01:16:05.725
Ginkgo.
Never heard of it.


1074
01:16:05.759 --> 01:16:07.136
On of the few trees
that can breathe


1075
01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:08.695
our dirty city air.

1076
01:16:08.728 --> 01:16:11.665
Maybe we'd better
wait over there.


1077
01:16:11.698 --> 01:16:13.900
Do you want it right here
with an audience?


1078
01:16:13.933 --> 01:16:16.369
All right, men.
Onward and upward!


1079
01:16:16.402 --> 01:16:18.104
You didn't grow old
in this business


1080
01:16:18.137 --> 01:16:20.073
taking those kind
of chances.


1081
01:16:20.106 --> 01:16:22.075
Don't try me, son.

1082
01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.082
That was very interesting,
what you told the boys.


1083
01:16:29.115 --> 01:16:30.684
Of course,
occupation-wise,


1084
01:16:30.717 --> 01:16:32.986
Mother Nature offers
no real benefit


1085
01:16:33.019 --> 01:16:37.223
to their future
as, uh, competitors
in society's marketplace.


1086
01:16:39.025 --> 01:16:41.127
Smell that air, would you?

1087
01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:45.231
You'd never suspect
that each year, over

1088
01:18:20.293 --> 01:18:21.293
David!

1089
01:18:23.096 --> 01:18:24.130
Who is it?

1090
01:18:24.163 --> 01:18:25.865
Josephson!

1091
01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.501
What do you want?

1092
01:18:28.534 --> 01:18:31.004
I'm sorry you're
having trouble, baby.


1093
01:18:31.037 --> 01:18:33.940
You deserved better.
And you don't have
to worry about me.


1094
01:18:33.973 --> 01:18:36.293
Killing isn't my job.
There are plenty of
people to do that.


1095
01:18:37.811 --> 01:18:40.980
What is your job?
Following instructions.


1096
01:18:41.014 --> 01:18:44.050
Please believe me, David.
Sometimes I don't like
my instructions,


1097
01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:46.152
but I follow them.
Why?


1098
01:18:46.185 --> 01:18:49.155
The "M-a-j-o-r" pays me
three times what I'm worth.


1099
01:18:49.188 --> 01:18:50.465
You can understand that,
can't you?


1100
01:18:50.489 --> 01:18:52.992
What do you want?

1101
01:18:53.026 --> 01:18:56.262
We've looked everywhere for it.
You know that, David.


1102
01:18:56.295 --> 01:18:58.231
Looked for what?

1103
01:18:58.264 --> 01:19:01.334
Empty your pockets.
I'll stay right here.


1104
01:19:01.367 --> 01:19:03.937
Put everything on the ground
and then turn and walk away.


1105
01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:06.072
Suppose it's
not in my pocket!


1106
01:19:06.105 --> 01:19:09.408
It doesn't matter.
You're all alone, David!


1107
01:19:09.442 --> 01:19:11.945
There's no-one to help you.
No-one you can talk to.


1108
01:19:11.978 --> 01:19:13.112
We'll find you again!

1109
01:19:22.355 --> 01:19:24.824
There's nowhere
to go, David!


1110
01:19:26.525 --> 01:19:28.327
You almost got me!
So?


1111
01:20:51.244 --> 01:20:55.581
Unconscious amnesia can
exist for an hour or two.


1112
01:20:55.614 --> 01:20:58.317
Sometimes, on rare occasions,
for a day or two!


1113
01:20:58.351 --> 01:20:59.585
But two years, impossible!

1114
01:21:08.327 --> 01:21:10.647
Didn't I make it clear
that I never wanted
to see you again?


1115
01:21:12.999 --> 01:21:14.409
If there was anyone
else I could talk to,


1116
01:21:14.433 --> 01:21:15.501
I wouldn't be here.

1117
01:21:24.643 --> 01:21:29.015
Well. It appears
I've decided to grant you
a few minutes of my time.


1118
01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:33.519
Very well, Mr. Stillwell.

1119
01:21:33.552 --> 01:21:36.089
What's on your mind?
What causes amnesia?


1120
01:21:36.122 --> 01:21:39.292
A severe shock, Mr. Stillwell.

1121
01:21:39.325 --> 01:21:41.427
Either physical or mental.

1122
01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:43.997
Mostly, we cause it ourselves.

1123
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:46.432
We're afraid
to remember something,
and therefore we don't.


1124
01:21:46.465 --> 01:21:52.271
Dr. Broden, I don't
think I've had amnesia
for two years.


1125
01:21:52.305 --> 01:21:55.141
I don't think I've had it
for more than two days.


1126
01:21:55.174 --> 01:21:56.742
What makes you think so?

1127
01:21:56.775 --> 01:21:59.378
I remembered something.

1128
01:21:59.412 --> 01:22:02.181
Something that happened
less than two years ago.


1129
01:22:02.215 --> 01:22:07.286
Whoa-ho, bravo, bravo!
With amnesia, you must remember.


1130
01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.488
First it's a block,
then it begins to crumble,


1131
01:22:09.522 --> 01:22:11.190
bit by bit.

1132
01:22:11.224 --> 01:22:13.726
Two years without knowing it,
that was impossible.


1133
01:22:13.759 --> 01:22:16.362
But two days,
why that's something else.


1134
01:22:16.395 --> 01:22:20.166
But couldn't a genius like you
have seen that yesterday?


1135
01:22:20.199 --> 01:22:25.104
A medical man has to be
very careful these days,
Mr. Stillwell.


1136
01:22:25.138 --> 01:22:29.142
Do you know that
a doctor can't afford to stop
at a street accident anymore?


1137
01:22:29.175 --> 01:22:32.345
If we stop to treat
a seriously-injured man,


1138
01:22:32.378 --> 01:22:34.313
we are legally responsible...

1139
01:22:34.347 --> 01:22:36.549
and therefore
we must let that man


1140
01:22:36.582 --> 01:22:38.551
bleed to death
on the street.


1141
01:22:38.584 --> 01:22:41.087
So you see, in today's
complicated world,


1142
01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:45.658
right becomes wrong
and wrong becomes right.


1143
01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:48.494
But in your case...
All right, Mr. Stillwell,


1144
01:22:48.527 --> 01:22:51.030
sometimes I do
something foolish.


1145
01:22:51.064 --> 01:22:54.267
There, you see?
I can be humble.


1146
01:22:54.300 --> 01:22:56.069
Now. What do you remember?

1147
01:22:59.305 --> 01:23:01.740
I was standing
under a tree...


1148
01:23:01.774 --> 01:23:04.377
in the country someplace,
not New York.


1149
01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:06.345
I was talking to a man...

1150
01:23:07.713 --> 01:23:09.415
Someone I'd forgotten
that I knew.


1151
01:23:09.448 --> 01:23:11.384
But now you remember him.

1152
01:23:13.686 --> 01:23:16.189
It was Charles Calvin.

1153
01:23:16.222 --> 01:23:18.624
Oh?

1154
01:23:18.657 --> 01:23:20.293
And this was less
that two years ago?


1155
01:23:20.326 --> 01:23:21.827
Yes.

1156
01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:24.597
Where was this tree,
Mr. Stillwell?


1157
01:23:27.633 --> 01:23:29.135
I'm not quite sure.

1158
01:23:29.168 --> 01:23:30.203
Close your eyes, please.

1159
01:23:31.770 --> 01:23:35.208
I want you to look
at that tree in your mind.


1160
01:23:35.241 --> 01:23:36.309
Can you see it?

1161
01:23:36.342 --> 01:23:38.077
Yes.

1162
01:23:38.111 --> 01:23:40.246
Now look around,
Mr. Stilwell.


1163
01:23:40.279 --> 01:23:42.215
What do you see?

1164
01:23:46.419 --> 01:23:48.654
It's the lab.

1165
01:23:48.687 --> 01:23:51.224
Garrison Laboratories.

1166
01:23:51.257 --> 01:23:53.359
Where?

1167
01:23:53.392 --> 01:23:55.328
It's in California.
It's a radiation lab.


1168
01:23:55.361 --> 01:23:56.629
Most of it's
built underground.


1169
01:23:56.662 --> 01:23:58.464
And what does that
mean to you?


1170
01:23:58.497 --> 01:24:01.167
I've been working there
for the past two years.


1171
01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.769
Well, what was a cost accountant
doing in a radiation lab?


1172
01:24:03.802 --> 01:24:06.605
I'm not a cost accountant.
I'm a physiochemist.


1173
01:24:10.876 --> 01:24:12.445
I was working there.

1174
01:24:12.478 --> 01:24:13.579
On the fourth level.

1175
01:24:13.612 --> 01:24:16.215
The fourth level underground?
Yes.


1176
01:24:16.249 --> 01:24:18.617
Mr. Stillwell,

1177
01:24:18.651 --> 01:24:21.420
could those have been
the "stairs you couldn't find"


1178
01:24:21.454 --> 01:24:23.289
here in New York?

1179
01:24:39.905 --> 01:24:41.707
Go on.

1180
01:24:46.479 --> 01:24:47.713
I can't.

1181
01:24:47.746 --> 01:24:49.148
What did you do
on the fourth level?


1182
01:24:49.182 --> 01:24:50.516
I don't know.

1183
01:24:50.549 --> 01:24:53.452
If you were there for
two years, when did you
get back to New York?


1184
01:24:53.486 --> 01:24:55.588
The day before yesterday.

1185
01:24:55.621 --> 01:24:57.390
Now, where did you get
your apartment?


1186
01:24:57.423 --> 01:24:59.158
That's mine, I own it.

1187
01:24:59.192 --> 01:25:01.694
Then you lived in New York
before you went to California.


1188
01:25:01.727 --> 01:25:03.829
- Yes!
- Where did you work?


1189
01:25:03.862 --> 01:25:05.231
At Unidyne!

1190
01:25:05.264 --> 01:25:06.232
As a phsyiochemist?

1191
01:25:06.265 --> 01:25:07.466
Yes!

1192
01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.667
Doing what, specifically?

1193
01:25:13.306 --> 01:25:14.573
I don't know.

1194
01:25:14.607 --> 01:25:17.276
- Why did you go to California?
- I don't know!


1195
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:18.644
Why did you come back
to New York?


1196
01:25:18.677 --> 01:25:20.246
I don't know!
Why do you go on asking


1197
01:25:20.279 --> 01:25:21.319
me these stupid questions?

1198
01:25:22.515 --> 01:25:24.683
What's wrong, Mr. Stillwell?

1199
01:25:24.717 --> 01:25:27.286
Don't you want to remember?

1200
01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.522
You don't really want
to remember anything, do you?


1201
01:25:34.827 --> 01:25:36.562
Yes I do, I do.

1202
01:25:38.464 --> 01:25:40.399
Of course I do!

1203
01:25:40.433 --> 01:25:41.767
I want to remember.

1204
01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:44.303
No, Mr. Stillwell.

1205
01:25:44.337 --> 01:25:46.439
No, you do not
want to remember.


1206
01:25:46.472 --> 01:25:48.674
That's why
you blacked it out.


1207
01:25:51.310 --> 01:25:53.612
Doctor, how sick am I?

1208
01:25:53.646 --> 01:25:55.314
You're not sick,
Mr. Stillwell.


1209
01:25:55.348 --> 01:25:56.415
You've been bruised.

1210
01:25:58.384 --> 01:26:01.987
When you bump your toe
in the dark, you're not sick.


1211
01:26:02.020 --> 01:26:04.590
But you do put a bandage on it,
in order to protect it


1212
01:26:04.623 --> 01:26:06.625
from further injury
while it heals.


1213
01:26:09.395 --> 01:26:12.298
Now, you've stubbed
your conscious mind.


1214
01:26:12.331 --> 01:26:14.467
And you've put a bandage
of forgetfulness on it,


1215
01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.435
until it recovers.

1216
01:26:16.469 --> 01:26:18.237
But you will remember
in spite of yourself.


1217
01:26:18.271 --> 01:26:19.605
It's the nature of the beast.

1218
01:26:19.638 --> 01:26:21.674
You are compelled
to pick at the scab


1219
01:26:21.707 --> 01:26:25.344
you've grown over
the bruise until you
succeed in pulling it off.


1220
01:26:25.378 --> 01:26:28.281
But why did I think
that I remembered
the past two years?


1221
01:26:28.314 --> 01:26:30.849
You didn't remember them.
You merely pretended to.


1222
01:26:30.883 --> 01:26:33.886
That was the bandage
you applied.


1223
01:26:33.919 --> 01:26:38.691
You created it
in order to replace the time
you didn't want to remember.


1224
01:26:38.724 --> 01:26:40.993
The two years
in California, perhaps.


1225
01:26:41.026 --> 01:26:42.761
Why? Why?

1226
01:26:46.565 --> 01:26:50.603
These are strange times,
Mr. Stillwell.


1227
01:26:50.636 --> 01:26:54.307
From here on, you'll begin
to remember everything.


1228
01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:55.841
Bits and pieces
will fall into place


1229
01:26:55.874 --> 01:26:58.811
with increasing frequency.

1230
01:26:58.844 --> 01:27:01.914
If you have the courage
to face that terrible thing


1231
01:27:01.947 --> 01:27:04.383
that made you forget.

1232
01:27:04.417 --> 01:27:06.652
But whatever it is, I don't
want to know about it.


1233
01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.588
Good-bye, Mr. Stillwell.

1234
01:27:22.901 --> 01:27:25.571
You're a brilliant man,
Broden, and no doubt
a good scientist.


1235
01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.875
But you're not much
of a doctor.


1236
01:27:29.908 --> 01:27:32.711
Or a human being, either.

1237
01:27:32.745 --> 01:27:34.279
God knows.

1238
01:27:38.551 --> 01:27:41.031
Has the doctor made
another appointment
with you, Mr. Stillwell?


1239
01:27:56.435 --> 01:27:57.403
You're late, David.

1240
01:27:57.436 --> 01:27:59.638
Terribly late.

1241
01:27:59.672 --> 01:28:03.442
Frances, I'm so sorry.
Yes, David. I know.


1242
01:28:04.743 --> 01:28:05.754
It's too bad
you missed the funeral.


1243
01:28:05.778 --> 01:28:06.812
It was lovely!

1244
01:28:06.845 --> 01:28:08.089
The governor came down
from Albany.


1245
01:28:08.113 --> 01:28:09.791
There was even a wire
from the president...


1246
01:28:09.815 --> 01:28:12.518
Everyone was there!

1247
01:28:12.551 --> 01:28:14.887
Everyone except
David Stillwell.


1248
01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:16.522
I'm sorry
I couldn't come.


1249
01:28:16.555 --> 01:28:18.557
The coffin was
closed, you know?


1250
01:28:18.591 --> 01:28:20.659
Charles used to be
quite handsome.


1251
01:28:20.693 --> 01:28:22.461
But there was
nothing they could do.


1252
01:28:22.495 --> 01:28:25.731
After all, he did
fall 27 floors.
Frances, stop it.


1253
01:28:30.636 --> 01:28:33.406
You know how much
I'll miss him.


1254
01:28:33.439 --> 01:28:36.509
Will you?
You know what he meant to me.


1255
01:28:36.542 --> 01:28:38.944
It's all right, David.

1256
01:28:38.977 --> 01:28:40.579
I know what Charles was.

1257
01:28:40.613 --> 01:28:41.613
And so do you.

1258
01:28:44.850 --> 01:28:45.850
What do you mean?

1259
01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:48.980
Isn't that
why you killed him?


1260
01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.061
What are you talking about?

1261
01:28:57.730 --> 01:28:58.897
Where were you
that afternoon?


1262
01:29:01.867 --> 01:29:05.538
Why... I was in
my office, of course.


1263
01:29:06.805 --> 01:29:08.040
At Garrison.

1264
01:29:08.073 --> 01:29:09.808
What are you
talking about, David?


1265
01:29:09.842 --> 01:29:12.077
Garrison's in California.

1266
01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:14.713
You were in Charles's
office here, in New York.


1267
01:29:14.747 --> 01:29:16.915
I just had a call to come up
to C.C.'s office.


1268
01:29:16.949 --> 01:29:19.585
"C.C.'s Office."

1269
01:29:19.618 --> 01:29:22.821
There was no-one
in Charles's office
when Josephson got there.


1270
01:29:22.855 --> 01:29:24.156
Not even Charles.

1271
01:29:24.189 --> 01:29:25.991
Just an open window.

1272
01:29:31.797 --> 01:29:33.832
That's impossible.

1273
01:29:33.866 --> 01:29:34.933
That's impossible!

1274
01:29:34.967 --> 01:29:38.571
But your nightmare began
at almost the exact moment


1275
01:29:38.604 --> 01:29:39.672
his ended!

1276
01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:46.845
No. I couldn't have
done anything to him!


1277
01:29:46.879 --> 01:29:48.981
I adored the man, Frances,
you know I did.


1278
01:29:49.014 --> 01:29:51.116
For God's sake, David,
what are you doing?


1279
01:29:51.149 --> 01:29:53.519
I loved him,
more than my own father!


1280
01:29:53.552 --> 01:29:55.488
David! Don't do it!

1281
01:29:55.521 --> 01:29:58.123
I would have done anything
he asked! Anything!


1282
01:29:59.692 --> 01:30:02.561
You mustn't think
I blame you, David.


1283
01:30:02.595 --> 01:30:04.830
It was his face.

1284
01:30:04.863 --> 01:30:07.633
You didn't have to know who
Charles Calvin was...


1285
01:30:07.666 --> 01:30:10.503
to know the magnificent work
the man who wore that face


1286
01:30:10.536 --> 01:30:12.638
was capable of doing.

1287
01:30:25.551 --> 01:30:26.619
Where did this come from?

1288
01:30:26.652 --> 01:30:28.987
Well, Crawford
gave it to Charles.


1289
01:30:29.021 --> 01:30:30.723
Crawford?
Who's Crawford?


1290
01:30:30.756 --> 01:30:33.125
Crawford Gilcuddy.

1291
01:30:33.158 --> 01:30:35.758
You were there
at the dinner, the night
he presented it to Charles.


1292
01:30:37.229 --> 01:30:38.664
What does it mean?

1293
01:30:38.697 --> 01:30:40.733
It's the motto of Unidyne.

1294
01:30:40.766 --> 01:30:42.768
Crawford's the president.

1295
01:30:55.981 --> 01:30:59.618
He knows!
He knows what happened!


1296
01:30:59.652 --> 01:31:02.755
Crawford?
Yes. The Major.


1297
01:31:26.612 --> 01:31:28.747
That's why I want you
to meet Crawford.


1298
01:31:28.781 --> 01:31:30.324
Unidyne will give you
greater opportunities


1299
01:31:30.348 --> 01:31:32.751
to work for world peace.

1300
01:31:32.785 --> 01:31:34.519
Greater than teaching
at the university.


1301
01:31:36.188 --> 01:31:37.923
The more scientists like you

1302
01:31:37.956 --> 01:31:42.094
that I can place with
organizations like Unidyne,


1303
01:31:42.127 --> 01:31:45.898
the greater the chances
of one day achieving
a victory...


1304
01:31:45.931 --> 01:31:47.165
over human misery.

1305
01:32:18.263 --> 01:32:19.765
David!

1306
01:32:21.834 --> 01:32:25.771
Why did you come here?
You were right.
I had nowhere else to go.


1307
01:32:25.804 --> 01:32:28.674
It was foolish, bubi.
Very foolish.


1308
01:32:28.707 --> 01:32:30.643
And then some.

1309
01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.281
Uh...
I owe you some pain.


1310
01:32:36.314 --> 01:32:38.216
Mr. Will...

1311
01:32:44.089 --> 01:32:47.760
California
isn't the end of
the earth, David.


1312
01:32:47.793 --> 01:32:49.728
The foundation wants
to find a way...


1313
01:32:49.762 --> 01:32:53.065
to neutralize
atomic radiation.


1314
01:32:53.098 --> 01:32:55.300
To make the peaceful uses
of nuclear energy


1315
01:32:55.333 --> 01:32:59.705
safer, for industry
and medicine.


1316
01:32:59.738 --> 01:33:01.740
I can get Crawford to give
you a leave of absence.


1317
01:33:05.443 --> 01:33:07.012
Please... stop!

1318
01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:16.121
Hello, Charles?
I'm sorry to disturb you.


1319
01:33:16.154 --> 01:33:19.992
I think I've found what
we've been looking for.


1320
01:33:20.025 --> 01:33:23.261
And if I'm right
about it, well...


1321
01:33:23.295 --> 01:33:25.239
why don't I fly back
to New York right away
and see you.


1322
01:33:25.263 --> 01:33:27.065
You're the only one
I can talk to.


1323
01:33:27.099 --> 01:33:28.734
Willard, that's enough.

1324
01:33:30.903 --> 01:33:32.705
I said that's enough.

1325
01:33:32.738 --> 01:33:34.106
I owe him!

1326
01:33:34.139 --> 01:33:36.074
Leave him alone!

1327
01:33:54.459 --> 01:33:56.795
Now, Josephson,
get me a cloth,
would you please?


1328
01:34:02.968 --> 01:34:04.448
It was generous
of you to come, David.


1329
01:34:09.775 --> 01:34:11.710
I'll try not
to hurt you, David.


1330
01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:18.416
Violence is something
new to you, isn't it?


1331
01:34:18.450 --> 01:34:21.820
Well, I can't say
that I care very
much for it myself.


1332
01:34:21.854 --> 01:34:26.124
But, uh, more and more,
people seem to be...


1333
01:34:26.158 --> 01:34:27.860
Be craving it
as part of their lives.


1334
01:34:27.893 --> 01:34:28.994
Don't you think so?

1335
01:34:43.075 --> 01:34:45.778
Yes. That belonged
to poor Charles.


1336
01:34:47.846 --> 01:34:50.148
I had to come back, Charles.

1337
01:34:50.182 --> 01:34:53.085
I didn't know how to
handle something like this.


1338
01:34:53.118 --> 01:34:56.288
It's too big.
You're quite right, David.


1339
01:34:56.321 --> 01:34:58.991
It is too big.

1340
01:34:59.024 --> 01:35:00.504
That's why I want
Crawford to hear it.


1341
01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:05.130
I don't understand what
he's got to do with this.


1342
01:35:05.163 --> 01:35:07.532
Listen to him, David.

1343
01:35:07.565 --> 01:35:11.236
It's not gonna hurt you
to listen to him.


1344
01:35:11.269 --> 01:35:12.905
Ah, David!

1345
01:35:12.938 --> 01:35:15.307
This is a surprise!
When did you get back?
This afternoon.


1346
01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:17.375
Sit down, Crawford.

1347
01:35:19.177 --> 01:35:21.814
David has made
a very interesting discovery.


1348
01:35:21.847 --> 01:35:24.016
He wants to
tell you about it.


1349
01:35:26.084 --> 01:35:28.553
Of course, it's...
just the beginning.


1350
01:35:28.586 --> 01:35:32.991
But David assures me
that it checks out so far.


1351
01:35:33.025 --> 01:35:34.435
I don't suppose that
you can make anything more


1352
01:35:34.459 --> 01:35:35.961
out of that equation
than I have.


1353
01:35:37.595 --> 01:35:39.364
Where is it, David?

1354
01:35:39.397 --> 01:35:40.933
It wasn't in Charles' office,

1355
01:35:40.966 --> 01:35:43.201
after he was killed,
so I know that you have it.


1356
01:35:43.235 --> 01:35:45.938
Where is it?

1357
01:35:45.971 --> 01:35:48.006
Don't be foolish, David.
Tell him.


1358
01:35:49.842 --> 01:35:52.878
He's not going
to steal it, you know.


1359
01:35:52.911 --> 01:35:55.247
Are you, Major?

1360
01:35:55.280 --> 01:35:58.416
David has discovered
a method of neutralizing


1361
01:35:58.450 --> 01:36:02.254
nuclear radiation
at the source.


1362
01:36:02.287 --> 01:36:05.423
The danger of radiation
will no longer exist.


1363
01:36:06.458 --> 01:36:09.127
Is that right, David?

1364
01:36:09.161 --> 01:36:10.562
I think so.

1365
01:36:10.595 --> 01:36:13.498
Are you talking
about fallout?


1366
01:36:13.531 --> 01:36:16.468
Well, fallout is
a term that applies only
to nuclear explosions.


1367
01:36:16.501 --> 01:36:21.173
Eliminating fallout
would have a great
strategic value, David.


1368
01:36:21.206 --> 01:36:23.508
Yes, by making a clean bomb
that would be safer to use.


1369
01:36:23.541 --> 01:36:24.541
That's right!

1370
01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.016
But you know that you'd also
be making them easier to use.


1371
01:36:31.049 --> 01:36:33.085
Relax, David.

1372
01:36:33.118 --> 01:36:37.355
Missing the point, David.
What you're talking about
has nothing to do with reality.


1373
01:36:37.389 --> 01:36:41.393
What I'm talking about is
saving lives, not taking them.


1374
01:36:41.426 --> 01:36:44.096
Or isn't there enough money
in peace these days?


1375
01:36:44.129 --> 01:36:46.598
You'd better have copies
made of this right away.


1376
01:36:46.631 --> 01:36:48.266
I want my physiochemistry
division to...


1377
01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:49.935
Put that down!

1378
01:36:49.968 --> 01:36:51.536
I don't work
for Unidyne anymore.


1379
01:36:59.411 --> 01:37:02.114
Or do I?

1380
01:37:02.147 --> 01:37:05.283
Why don't you
leave us alone, Major?


1381
01:37:05.317 --> 01:37:08.353
I think I can work
this out with David.


1382
01:37:08.386 --> 01:37:11.890
I want this settled,
before he leaves the building.


1383
01:37:11.924 --> 01:37:14.192
I'll do it my way.

1384
01:37:14.226 --> 01:37:17.529
And remember, David is
a very close friend of mine.


1385
01:37:20.198 --> 01:37:23.035
He was the best friend
you ever had.


1386
01:37:23.068 --> 01:37:26.038
He dragged you out of
that ivy-covered crypt


1387
01:37:26.071 --> 01:37:31.043
you'd buried yourself
in, and handed you
a brilliant career.


1388
01:37:31.076 --> 01:37:33.912
And you repaid him,
didn't you?


1389
01:37:33.946 --> 01:37:37.349
Damn you. Damn you,
you murdered him!


1390
01:37:37.382 --> 01:37:39.017
Major!

1391
01:37:40.318 --> 01:37:42.420
Leave him alone.

1392
01:37:42.454 --> 01:37:45.890
Shela dear, you...
you mustn't interfere
where you're not concerned.


1393
01:37:47.225 --> 01:37:50.996
And when did you start
calling me "Major"?


1394
01:37:51.029 --> 01:37:53.265
I'm Crawford to my friends.

1395
01:37:53.298 --> 01:37:56.634
You never used
to call him "Major"!


1396
01:37:56.668 --> 01:37:58.503
I thought only his employees
called him that.


1397
01:37:59.571 --> 01:38:01.206
It's just an old habit.

1398
01:38:01.239 --> 01:38:02.919
Don't forget, we were
in the Army together.


1399
01:38:05.543 --> 01:38:09.681
Charles, tell me the truth.
Does your Peace Foundation


1400
01:38:09.714 --> 01:38:11.516
have any connection
with Unidyne?


1401
01:38:13.085 --> 01:38:15.087
Why would that
interest you, David?


1402
01:38:15.120 --> 01:38:18.123
Well, because a foundation
doing business with
a profit-making organization


1403
01:38:18.156 --> 01:38:20.225
is illegal!

1404
01:38:20.258 --> 01:38:23.728
I can't respect any legality
that would impede progress.


1405
01:38:23.761 --> 01:38:28.000
We're being turned into
statistics, case histories
and percentage points!


1406
01:38:28.033 --> 01:38:29.634
All in the name of progress!

1407
01:38:32.370 --> 01:38:33.690
Whatever happened
to human beings?


1408
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:40.745
Is that what you want
to see, David?


1409
01:38:40.778 --> 01:38:43.181
Human beings?

1410
01:38:49.354 --> 01:38:51.523
Come here, David.

1411
01:38:51.556 --> 01:38:53.491
Look at them!

1412
01:38:57.695 --> 01:39:00.132
Do they look like
human beings?


1413
01:39:00.165 --> 01:39:02.200
Or ants?

1414
01:39:02.234 --> 01:39:04.669
You're quite right, David.
They are statistics.


1415
01:39:04.702 --> 01:39:07.072
But I didn't
do it to them.


1416
01:39:07.105 --> 01:39:10.475
I'm not responsible.
Maybe you are, Charles.


1417
01:39:10.508 --> 01:39:12.544
You're one of the leaders.

1418
01:39:12.577 --> 01:39:14.446
You have the power
to control progress,


1419
01:39:14.479 --> 01:39:16.114
and to protect
human dignity.


1420
01:39:19.217 --> 01:39:21.186
Now what's this?
Crawford's way
of keeping me


1421
01:39:21.219 --> 01:39:23.621
in the building until
you can soften me up?


1422
01:39:23.655 --> 01:39:26.224
Don't you see
what he is, Charles?
Miss Paxton? Can you hear me?


1423
01:39:26.258 --> 01:39:30.362
Those people down there
aren't even ants to him.


1424
01:39:30.395 --> 01:39:32.797
They're articles of commerce.

1425
01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:38.403
That man computes human lives
in terms of dollars and cents!


1426
01:39:38.436 --> 01:39:41.506
He's made you
his prize salesman.


1427
01:39:41.539 --> 01:39:45.543
And I'm the cost accountant,
trying to cut down his overhead


1428
01:39:45.577 --> 01:39:47.612
with what you and he
call progress!


1429
01:39:48.813 --> 01:39:51.083
I won't let you
have this, Charles.


1430
01:39:51.116 --> 01:39:55.820
I'm tired of you, David.
Just give me the piece of paper
and get the hell out of here.


1431
01:39:55.853 --> 01:39:57.589
How far would I get?
A block? Two?


1432
01:39:59.624 --> 01:40:04.429
I know about
the connection between
Unidyne and the Foundation.


1433
01:40:04.462 --> 01:40:09.767
Which is a damn sight
more than Joe Turtle
or Caselle knew.


1434
01:40:09.801 --> 01:40:12.137
At least I'll know
why I'm being murdered.


1435
01:40:12.170 --> 01:40:15.573
I want that paper.
Ah, I don't have it anymore.


1436
01:40:15.607 --> 01:40:16.887
Pencil and paper.

1437
01:40:34.559 --> 01:40:36.528
You know what was
on the paper, David.


1438
01:40:36.561 --> 01:40:38.496
Write it down.

1439
01:40:41.199 --> 01:40:42.600
Willard?

1440
01:40:42.634 --> 01:40:44.402
Give me your gun,
Willard.


1441
01:40:51.809 --> 01:40:54.279
I have removed
all of the bullets...


1442
01:40:54.312 --> 01:40:55.847
except one.

1443
01:40:58.916 --> 01:41:02.587
All right, Willard.
Slowly. One at a time.


1444
01:41:11.763 --> 01:41:14.132
Pick up the pen, David.

1445
01:41:20.772 --> 01:41:21.772
Willard?

1446
01:41:30.782 --> 01:41:32.850
I'm not impressed, David.

1447
01:41:32.884 --> 01:41:35.887
You're a scientist. You knew
the odds were in your favor
for the first one.


1448
01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:38.190
But no-one is bluffing.

1449
01:41:38.223 --> 01:41:39.724
Not you. Not me.

1450
01:41:39.757 --> 01:41:42.360
And certainly not Willard.

1451
01:41:43.861 --> 01:41:44.861
Pick up the pen.

1452
01:41:53.405 --> 01:41:54.706
Willard?

1453
01:42:02.480 --> 01:42:04.148
For God's sake, David,
what are you doing?


1454
01:42:05.583 --> 01:42:07.385
Don't do it!

1455
01:42:07.419 --> 01:42:09.187
David, don't do it!

1456
01:42:13.491 --> 01:42:14.659
Charles!

1457
01:43:06.411 --> 01:43:07.812
I didn't kill him, Crawford.

1458
01:43:07.845 --> 01:43:10.482
You did!

1459
01:43:11.916 --> 01:43:14.719
You're still
confused, David.


1460
01:43:14.752 --> 01:43:17.289
I wasn't there.
You were.


1461
01:43:17.322 --> 01:43:19.691
You were there, Crawford.
Your sickness was inside him.


1462
01:43:21.459 --> 01:43:23.395
You're a carrier.

1463
01:43:23.428 --> 01:43:25.430
You infected him
and he died from it.


1464
01:43:25.463 --> 01:43:28.300
And now it's your turn.

1465
01:43:28.333 --> 01:43:29.973
Unless you're interested
in staying alive.


1466
01:43:33.805 --> 01:43:36.040
No?

1467
01:43:36.073 --> 01:43:37.073
Willard?

1468
01:43:38.610 --> 01:43:39.844
Wait...

1469
01:43:54.058 --> 01:43:56.761
You... idiot!

1470
01:43:56.794 --> 01:43:59.263
You... damned idiot!

1471
01:44:02.634 --> 01:44:08.406
You just won't learn not to
interfere, will you, Shela?


1472
01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.007
You always were
too extravagant,


1473
01:44:10.041 --> 01:44:12.410
but this time you're
going to pay the bill.


1474
01:44:12.444 --> 01:44:14.846
For once in your life,
you've chosen the wrong side!


1475
01:44:14.879 --> 01:44:17.415
Now then, David, you were
about to say something.


1476
01:44:17.449 --> 01:44:19.384
David, please give him
what he wants!


1477
01:44:22.587 --> 01:44:23.455
Is that what you want?

1478
01:44:23.488 --> 01:44:26.023
I want you alive.

1479
01:44:26.057 --> 01:44:27.525
You're wasting time, David.

1480
01:44:29.527 --> 01:44:30.527
What's wrong, Major?

1481
01:44:32.397 --> 01:44:33.365
You look nervous.

1482
01:44:33.398 --> 01:44:34.532
Why should I be?

1483
01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.001
That's what I want to know.

1484
01:44:40.972 --> 01:44:42.039
Josephson?

1485
01:44:42.073 --> 01:44:43.675
Hmm?

1486
01:44:43.708 --> 01:44:45.677
Is that who you're
worried about, Major?


1487
01:44:45.710 --> 01:44:47.645
Why should he worry
about me?


1488
01:44:47.679 --> 01:44:50.415
Because, I'm not
on the hook anymore.


1489
01:44:50.448 --> 01:44:51.883
You are.

1490
01:44:51.916 --> 01:44:54.352
What are you talking about?

1491
01:44:54.386 --> 01:44:55.386
You've got the gun.

1492
01:44:56.921 --> 01:44:59.791
I... don't know anything
about killing, Major.


1493
01:44:59.824 --> 01:45:02.394
It won't be murder,
Josephson.


1494
01:45:02.427 --> 01:45:03.867
David's intent
on committing suicide.


1495
01:45:06.631 --> 01:45:09.401
No good, Josephson.
There's no-one else.


1496
01:45:09.434 --> 01:45:10.868
He's alone
except for you.


1497
01:45:12.570 --> 01:45:13.981
For once in your life,
you've got power.


1498
01:45:14.005 --> 01:45:15.907
Use it!

1499
01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:18.042
How?

1500
01:45:18.075 --> 01:45:20.745
He ordered two men killed.
That's first-degree murder.


1501
01:45:22.046 --> 01:45:23.381
We can get him,
Josephson!


1502
01:45:23.415 --> 01:45:24.415
You and I!

1503
01:45:26.784 --> 01:45:28.820
Don't be an idiot,
Josephson.


1504
01:45:28.853 --> 01:45:30.087
You'll have a job
with Unidyne


1505
01:45:30.121 --> 01:45:31.723
for as long as you live.

1506
01:45:31.756 --> 01:45:34.058
And how long do
you think that'll be?


1507
01:45:34.091 --> 01:45:37.061
You've hesitated too long.

1508
01:45:37.094 --> 01:45:39.063
He'll remember that.

1509
01:45:39.096 --> 01:45:42.500
One phone call, Josephson,

1510
01:45:42.534 --> 01:45:44.534
and you're a wealthy man
for the rest of your life.


1511
01:45:50.708 --> 01:45:53.911
One phone call,
and it'll be too late.


1512
01:45:53.945 --> 01:45:56.414
You won't be alone anymore.
Don't, Major.


1513
01:45:56.448 --> 01:45:58.382
Please don't.

1514
01:46:01.586 --> 01:46:03.655
All right, Josephson.

1515
01:46:05.890 --> 01:46:07.992
You think about it.

1516
01:46:09.461 --> 01:46:10.928
You think about it carefully.

1517
01:46:10.962 --> 01:46:13.130
Commit, Josephson!

1518
01:46:13.164 --> 01:46:15.833
If you're not committed
to anything, you're just
taking up space!


1519
01:46:18.202 --> 01:46:20.738
Kill him.

1520
01:46:20.772 --> 01:46:22.540
If you can't, I will.

1521
01:46:56.841 --> 01:47:00.011
Are they making it
tough for you?
No, I'm all right.


1522
01:47:00.044 --> 01:47:01.946
How about you?

1523
01:47:01.979 --> 01:47:04.549
Is Humpty-Dumpty
back together again?


1524
01:47:04.582 --> 01:47:07.619
I think so.
All the pieces
seem to fit now.


1525
01:47:13.658 --> 01:47:16.060
Do you know...
why it happened?


1526
01:47:17.795 --> 01:47:20.097
I believed in
Charles Calvin so much


1527
01:47:20.131 --> 01:47:21.999
that I... I forgot

1528
01:47:22.033 --> 01:47:23.701
he was only a human being.

1529
01:47:25.703 --> 01:47:27.639
What are
you going to do now?


1530
01:47:27.672 --> 01:47:28.973
Go back to work, I guess.

1531
01:47:32.143 --> 01:47:34.245
I don't suppose
you could use any help?


1532
01:47:36.147 --> 01:47:38.816
Who do you have in mind?

1533
01:47:38.850 --> 01:47:41.819
Well, you could run an ad
in the Times.


1534
01:47:41.853 --> 01:47:45.557
"Extremely
lonely young lady...


1535
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:48.693
"with a fairly low
opinion of herself,


1536
01:47:48.726 --> 01:47:51.729
"due to many mistakes...

1537
01:47:51.763 --> 01:47:55.533
willing to work
long, hard hours."


1538
01:47:55.567 --> 01:47:57.735
Think I'd get
any answers?


1539
01:47:57.769 --> 01:47:59.671
You might.

1540
01:48:02.039 --> 01:48:03.741
Oh, David...

1541
01:48:03.775 --> 01:48:06.678
help me,
please help me...


1542
01:48:06.711 --> 01:48:09.046
We'll help each other.

1543
01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:11.082
That's really what
it's all about anyway.
