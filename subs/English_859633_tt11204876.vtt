But I'm weak.

495

519
00:29:31.748 --> 00:29:33.924

555
00:31:35.567 --> 00:31:36.916
Man, I had to go to the church

558
00:31:39.353 --> 00:31:40.529
Man, I had to do something man,

561
00:31:43.009 --> 00:31:44.097

to, you know what I'm saying?


648
00:34:25.781 --> 00:34:26.825
The new whoop-de-whoop?

649
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:28.479
- I'm tripping on it.

650
00:34:28.522 --> 00:34:30.829
Like me and Karen like we
doing super good right now.


651
00:34:30.873 --> 00:34:31.874
- [Keenan] Mm hm.

652
00:34:31.917 --> 00:34:33.266
- And now.

653
00:34:33.310 --> 00:34:37.009
Now I get faded with, I
got a possible baby momma?


654
00:34:37.053 --> 00:34:39.708
- Man, I can't believe
she said she pregnant bro!


655
00:34:39.751 --> 00:34:41.492
[laughs]

656
00:34:41.535 --> 00:34:42.841
- You can't tell me that

657
00:34:42.885 --> 00:34:45.148
when your period was
missing a month ago?


658
00:34:45.191 --> 00:34:46.715
Like man, do I even
tell my gal though man?


659
00:34:46.758 --> 00:34:49.718
Or do I just, let it
ride maybe get a DNA test


660
00:34:49.761 --> 00:34:51.284
see if it's mine but like,

661
00:34:51.328 --> 00:34:52.677
I got a gal out
here on the streets


662
00:34:52.721 --> 00:34:54.287
talking about how she
pregnant with my kid.


663
00:34:54.331 --> 00:34:55.898
So I feel like I gotta tell her.

664
00:34:55.941 --> 00:34:58.117
- You gotta tell
her though because,


665
00:34:58.161 --> 00:35:00.554
well you gotta tell her
if you find out 100%


666
00:35:00.598 --> 00:35:03.253
that it's yours, but
right now you don't know,


667
00:35:03.296 --> 00:35:04.863
so it's kinda like
a balancing act,


668
00:35:04.907 --> 00:35:06.691
because if you tell
her and it ain't yours,


669
00:35:06.735 --> 00:35:08.301
it's gonna ruin
your relationship.


670
00:35:08.345 --> 00:35:10.216
But if you tell her
and it is yours,


671
00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:11.957
you know at least you
heading it off early


672
00:35:12.001 --> 00:35:12.828
and letting her know what's up,

673
00:35:12.871 --> 00:35:14.351
because she deserve that.

674
00:35:15.787 --> 00:35:17.006
- [Marvin] I'm stressing bro,

675
00:35:17.049 --> 00:35:18.834
I so appreciate this right here.

676
00:35:18.877 --> 00:35:19.965
- Hey, but look

677
00:35:20.009 --> 00:35:21.401

678
00:35:21.445 --> 00:35:22.925

681
00:35:25.362 --> 00:35:26.667
- It's dope.

682
00:35:26.711 --> 00:35:28.191

like I tried to tell her.

739
00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.879
Man, hit that one
time before we go.


740
00:37:30.922 --> 00:37:31.792
- All right, no problem.

741
00:37:31.836 --> 00:37:33.142
What you saying?

742
00:37:33.185 --> 00:37:34.708
- Look, I went over to my
gal's house to tell her.


743
00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:38.756
And then her ex was getting
the rest of his stuff


744
00:37:38.799 --> 00:37:40.932
out of the house or
something like that.


745
00:37:40.976 --> 00:37:42.716
And then so she said it was
cool for me to come over,


746
00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.066
so I'm walking in the house.

747
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.980
I ain't even know
whose car it was.


748
00:37:45.023 --> 00:37:46.503
And we went and bumped shoulders

749
00:37:46.546 --> 00:37:48.374
as we walking on the sidewalk.

750
00:37:48.418 --> 00:37:50.899
So man, I looked at little dude,

751
00:37:50.942 --> 00:37:52.074
he ain't paying no attention
cause my gal done grab me,


752
00:37:52.117 --> 00:37:53.945
man don't worry about him.

753
00:37:53.989 --> 00:37:54.859
- Right?

754
00:37:54.903 --> 00:37:55.860
- So dude goes and drives off.

755
00:37:55.904 --> 00:37:57.209
- Right.

756
00:37:57.253 --> 00:37:58.907
- It ain't no thing about that.

757
00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:01.431
But it hand me the strength so
I couldn't even tell my girl.


758
00:38:01.474 --> 00:38:02.867
- Right.

759
00:38:02.911 --> 00:38:04.913
- About the situation cause
I was just in a situation


760
00:38:04.956 --> 00:38:07.698

around my new gal.


761
00:38:07.741 --> 00:38:10.135

763
00:38:13.095 --> 00:38:14.183

00:38:14.226 --> 00:38:15.619
Like stay on the weights.

765
00:38:17.055 --> 00:38:18.535

Yo!

I ain't tell you but
I heard two gunshots,


793
00:39:20.118 --> 00:39:21.728
when we was sitting
off in the house.


794
00:39:21.772 --> 00:39:23.817
- He shot your car up?

795
00:39:23.861 --> 00:39:25.732
- He bumped into me,
later on about two hours,


796
00:39:25.776 --> 00:39:27.430
I heard two gun shots.

797
00:39:27.473 --> 00:39:29.954
I looked out the window, I
ain't seen nothing though.


798
00:39:29.998 --> 00:39:32.217
I ain't see nobody pulling
off, driving off, nothing.


799
00:39:32.261 --> 00:39:33.653
I heard two gunshots last night.

800
00:39:33.697 --> 00:39:35.394
And this dude done shot my car!

801
00:39:35.438 --> 00:39:36.265

803
00:39:37.788 --> 00:39:38.876
Hey man.

Then let's get.

808
00:39:44.751 --> 00:39:45.970

809
00:39:52.803 --> 00:39:55.588

810
00:39:55.632 --> 00:39:56.763

814
00:40:07.426 --> 00:40:10.038
- Someone shot my
buddy's car man.


815
00:40:12.605 --> 00:40:13.824
- I think I know a dude.

816
00:40:13.867 --> 00:40:15.217
Used to hang with my cousin.

817
00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.000
- Light skinned dude.

818
00:40:16.044 --> 00:40:17.175

00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:22.180

00:40:28.447 --> 00:40:29.057

- Man you sure that's
what you wanna do?


828
00:40:43.897 --> 00:40:45.595
You know he man,
he did not play.


829
00:40:45.638 --> 00:40:46.770
He might kill this dude.

830
00:40:46.813 --> 00:40:47.771
- I do not care.

831
00:40:47.814 --> 00:40:48.902
- Man, there's consequences.

832
00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:49.903
I care man.

833
00:40:49.947 --> 00:40:51.775
You supposed to be a Godly man.

834
00:40:51.818 --> 00:40:54.212
You sure you wanna go through
all the way with this?


835
00:40:54.256 --> 00:40:55.735
He shot your car, not you bro.

836
00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.304
For real.

837
00:40:59.348 --> 00:41:00.740
You sure this what you wanna do?

838
00:41:00.784 --> 00:41:02.829
Cause you call him you already
know it's gonna pop off man.


839
00:41:02.873 --> 00:41:04.483
- Yeah, it's on.

840
00:41:04.527 --> 00:41:05.180
It's on.

841
00:41:06.833 --> 00:41:11.229
- Bro, this has got lifelong
type of consequences though.


842
00:41:11.273 --> 00:41:12.491
You know what I'm saying?

843
00:41:12.535 --> 00:41:14.580
Because look, if he pop him.

844
00:41:15.799 --> 00:41:16.582
Man.

845
00:41:17.844 --> 00:41:19.107
People don't get
away with murder.


846
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:20.412
- These are my options.

847
00:41:20.456 --> 00:41:22.153
This dude's already
shooting at my stuff.


848
00:41:22.197 --> 00:41:24.634
I'm in the car,
he shooting at me?


849
00:41:25.896 --> 00:41:29.117
So it's either be
protected, or be taken out.


850
00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.379
- I understand that man.

851
00:41:30.422 --> 00:41:31.945
I'm just saying
make wise decisions,


852
00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:33.033
because this is a life-long --

853
00:41:33.077 --> 00:41:34.296
- Stay low-key.

854
00:41:34.339 --> 00:41:35.949
Don't let nobody know
where we staying.


855
00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:36.863
Stay off the horn,

856
00:41:36.907 --> 00:41:38.169
keep it as short as possible.

857
00:41:38.213 --> 00:41:39.779
We eat, don't talk
about no discussions.


858
00:41:39.823 --> 00:41:42.173
- I think you need to
take a deep breath,


859
00:41:42.217 --> 00:41:44.871
calm down and really think
about your next move man.


860
00:41:44.915 --> 00:41:46.960
Because I'm telling you, bro.

861
00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:49.398
- You don't get it.

862
00:41:49.441 --> 00:41:51.443
This dude's a gangster.

863
00:41:51.487 --> 00:41:52.227
He already.

864
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.923
- Man, all right.

865
00:41:55.273 --> 00:41:57.145
I mean, I'm just saying man
you need to pray about it


866
00:41:57.188 --> 00:41:59.408
before you make a decision man.

867
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:00.974
- Man.

868
00:42:01.018 --> 00:42:02.237
Man, I ain't hearing
what you saying.


869
00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:03.412
I'm calling my unc.

870
00:42:03.455 --> 00:42:04.891
- Do what you gotta do bro.

871
00:42:04.935 --> 00:42:06.415
Just saying.

872
00:42:06.458 --> 00:42:07.242
- You soft.

873
00:42:07.285 --> 00:42:08.808
- I'm soft?

874
00:42:08.852 --> 00:42:09.766
Man, I'm smart.

875
00:42:09.809 --> 00:42:11.550
That's why I'm out here.

876
00:42:11.594 --> 00:42:12.769
- I'm right here with you.

877
00:42:12.812 --> 00:42:14.423
- Right but you ain't
live the life out here.


878
00:42:14.466 --> 00:42:15.380
- Hello?

879
00:42:15.424 --> 00:42:16.686
Unc.

880
00:42:16.729 --> 00:42:20.472
Hey, I got a problem.

881
00:42:20.516 --> 00:42:23.954
Look, my girl ex got
mad, shot my car.


882
00:42:30.003 --> 00:42:32.267
Man, this dude's name is Tommy.

883
00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:33.746
I remember him saying
his name Tommy.


884
00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:35.313
I think he live
off of Hayes manor.


885
00:42:40.666 --> 00:42:42.146
Well, what you want me to do?

886
00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:47.673
All right.

887
00:42:50.763 --> 00:42:52.330
No, no, no man,
I didn't get hit.


888
00:42:52.374 --> 00:42:53.462
I'm straight.

889
00:42:53.505 --> 00:42:54.202
But my car.

890
00:42:58.293 --> 00:42:59.859
All right.

891
00:42:59.903 --> 00:43:00.860
Yeah, meet me at the spot.

892
00:43:02.732 --> 00:43:03.515
All right.

893
00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:06.214
- What'd he say?

894
00:43:07.519 --> 00:43:08.868
- Man.

895
00:43:08.912 --> 00:43:10.827
He about to come through.

896
00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:11.741
- That's what I thought.

897
00:43:11.784 --> 00:43:12.872
- He about to come through.

898
00:43:12.916 --> 00:43:13.960
- All right well.

899
00:43:14.004 --> 00:43:15.788
- Hey, since you

900
00:43:15.832 --> 00:43:20.315
we talking about you
right here with me.


901
00:43:20.358 --> 00:43:21.968
- Man, I'm just saying

902
00:43:22.012 --> 00:43:23.883
we already know right now
it's fixing to pop off.


903
00:43:23.927 --> 00:43:25.842
I mean, off the top.

904
00:43:25.885 --> 00:43:27.583
They, a dude murdered.

905
00:43:27.626 --> 00:43:31.021
I'm just saying it's a lot
of loose ends to tie up.


906
00:43:31.064 --> 00:43:32.283
That's all I'm saying.

907
00:43:32.327 --> 00:43:33.589
I mean you gotta
handle your business,


908
00:43:33.632 --> 00:43:34.981
I understand your car
got shot and all that.


909
00:43:35.025 --> 00:43:36.766
I'm just glad you
didn't get shot.


910
00:43:36.809 --> 00:43:38.028
But.

911
00:43:38.071 --> 00:43:40.335
Make sure that you
give the right response


912
00:43:40.378 --> 00:43:41.945
proper to what happen.

913
00:43:41.988 --> 00:43:42.728
- Yeah, yeah.

914
00:43:42.772 --> 00:43:43.686
Yeah yeah yeah.

915
00:43:43.729 --> 00:43:44.861
- Is all I'm saying.

916
00:43:44.904 --> 00:43:45.818
- There's a reason to go
to little man's house.


917
00:43:45.862 --> 00:43:46.819
Is all I'm a say.

918
00:43:46.863 --> 00:43:47.820
- Right.

919
00:43:47.864 --> 00:43:48.734
That's why we went.

920
00:43:48.778 --> 00:43:49.648
- There's a reason.

921
00:43:49.692 --> 00:43:50.301
- So we could protect ourselves.

922
00:43:50.345 --> 00:43:51.650
- Exactly.

923
00:43:51.694 --> 00:43:52.564
That's what I'm saying,
that's the whole point.


924
00:43:52.608 --> 00:43:53.478
- Okay, that's defensive.

925
00:43:53.522 --> 00:43:55.175
E is coming for the offensive.

926
00:43:55.219 --> 00:43:56.220
- Which wins games.

927
00:43:56.264 --> 00:43:58.266
- Defense will win championship.

928
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:59.832
- But now we on
some man stuff now.


929
00:43:59.876 --> 00:44:01.138
- Right, right.

930
00:44:01.181 --> 00:44:02.661
- Now we on the streets.

931
00:44:02.705 --> 00:44:03.967
- All right, let's go
on in the house man.


932
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:05.621
- See no we in the streets.

That's your phone

Hey, you calling me

Wait, what?

00:45:29.269 --> 00:45:30.793
She's on her way
to the hospital?


961
00:45:31.881 --> 00:45:32.664
What happened?

962
00:45:37.016 --> 00:45:39.802
What hospital is she at?

963
00:45:39.845 --> 00:45:40.890
All right I'm on my way.

964
00:45:40.933 --> 00:45:42.195

So, moving forward,

1189
00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.837
it would be really
important for both of us


1190
00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.013
but particularly
you to understand,


1191
00:57:10.057 --> 00:57:14.931
that our job
positions and stress


1192
00:57:16.106 --> 00:57:17.847
and sometimes even
relationships.


1193
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.328
Those things can be temporary.

1194
00:57:20.371 --> 00:57:25.202
And it's natural to want
to keep those things


1195
00:57:26.682 --> 00:57:30.120
or even experience loss,
stress, not being able to sleep.


1196
00:57:30.164 --> 00:57:33.428
When those things
are threatened.

00:57:33.471 --> 00:57:35.082
Or seem like they're
gonna move away.


1198
00:57:36.866 --> 00:57:41.523
But our happiness and
that peace of mind that


1199
00:57:41.566 --> 00:57:42.741
you were talking about,

1200
00:57:42.785 --> 00:57:45.483
those things aren't tied
to temporary things.


1201
00:57:47.616 --> 00:57:52.186
And your worth and your
sense of being enough

those things are
eternal, as you are.


1203
00:57:56.842 --> 00:57:59.497
So if we could keep
that orientation in mind


1204
00:57:59.541 --> 00:58:03.371
as we move forward, that
can be the foundation

01:02:48.917 --> 01:02:50.092
And get to me as
quick as possible


1284
01:02:50.135 --> 01:02:51.833
so we can read it.

1285
01:02:51.876 --> 01:02:54.836
- Absolutely, absolutely, thank
you, thank you, thank you.


1286
01:02:54.879 --> 01:02:57.186
[hip hop beat]

1287
01:03:17.554 --> 01:03:20.383
- My head has been a
lot clearer lately.


1288
01:03:20.427 --> 01:03:24.779
You know with me going
to like therapy man.


1289
01:03:24.822 --> 01:03:28.913
It really is
something that I think


1290
01:03:28.957 --> 01:03:31.568
everybody probably kind
of needs to look into.


1291
01:03:31.612 --> 01:03:33.048
Just a bit.

1292
01:03:33.091 --> 01:03:36.617
Just because it's,
man it's helpful


1293
01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.879
to work through some stuff.

1294
01:03:37.922 --> 01:03:39.533
Man, have you ever
thought about going


1295
01:03:39.576 --> 01:03:41.491
on and seeing a therapist
or something like that?


1296
01:03:41.535 --> 01:03:43.754
A councilor or
something like that?


1297
01:03:43.798 --> 01:03:45.060
[knocks]

1298
01:03:45.103 --> 01:03:45.756
- Come in.

1299
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:51.414
Mr. Robertson.

1300
01:03:51.458 --> 01:03:52.676
- [Keenan] Hey, how are you?

1301
01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.678
- [Therapist] Hey,
sir, good to see you.


1302
01:03:54.722 --> 01:03:55.766
Welcome back.

1303
01:03:55.810 --> 01:03:57.376
- Good to see you too.

1304
01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.334
- Absolutely, have a seat.

1305
01:03:58.377 --> 01:04:00.641
Whoops, thank you.

1306
01:04:01.729 --> 01:04:03.600
Okay, it's good to see you.

1307
01:04:03.644 --> 01:04:04.993
- You too, you too.

1308
01:04:05.036 --> 01:04:07.909
I thought that the last
session went really well,


1309
01:04:07.952 --> 01:04:10.694
so I decided to sign
up for another one.


1310
01:04:10.738 --> 01:04:11.782
- All right.

1311
01:04:11.826 --> 01:04:13.654
- Yeah, it helped
me a little bit.


1312
01:04:13.697 --> 01:04:15.307
And I appreciate that.

1313
01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:19.224
- Okay, so before I ask
about what's been going on,


1314
01:04:19.268 --> 01:04:21.836
what about the last
session did you like?


1315
01:04:21.879 --> 01:04:23.054
Did you --

1316
01:04:23.098 --> 01:04:26.101
- Well, it just
allowed me to be able


1317
01:04:26.144 --> 01:04:28.799
to just talk my way
through some things.


1318
01:04:28.843 --> 01:04:32.063
And be more solution-oriented

1319
01:04:32.107 --> 01:04:33.848
and not think about
stuff so much.


1320
01:04:33.891 --> 01:04:36.024
Like, oh I gotta get this
done, I gotta get this done.


1321
01:04:36.067 --> 01:04:38.853
And living in the
moment a little bit.


1322
01:04:38.896 --> 01:04:40.985
- Yeah, and I also
wanted to tell you


1323
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:43.858
that the pre and post
test that we took


1324
01:04:43.901 --> 01:04:45.773
to look at your stress levels?

1325
01:04:45.816 --> 01:04:48.036
They were really really
high when we first started


1326
01:04:48.079 --> 01:04:51.909
the session, and
your last one after


1327
01:04:51.953 --> 01:04:53.302
the session that we did?

1328
01:04:53.345 --> 01:04:54.782
It was significantly lower.

1329
01:04:54.825 --> 01:04:56.435
- Good.

1330
01:04:56.479 --> 01:04:57.915
- So it's good that I'm
hearing this data from you.


1331
01:04:57.959 --> 01:05:00.439
That you felt like you
got something out of it


1332
01:05:00.483 --> 01:05:04.008
because your scores showed
that you felt less stressed.


1333
01:05:04.052 --> 01:05:07.751
- Yeah, they told me that my
ACES score was really high?


1334
01:05:07.795 --> 01:05:10.928
From childhood trauma
or something like that.


1335
01:05:10.972 --> 01:05:12.364
But I don't know.

1336
01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:15.846
- Yeah, that's the Adversive
Childhood Experiences Survey.


1337
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:17.282
They came out of Harvard,

1338
01:05:17.326 --> 01:05:20.242
and actually they're trying
to put it into school systems


1339
01:05:20.285 --> 01:05:23.811
to make sure that we're
being able to identify


1340
01:05:23.854 --> 01:05:25.116
our kids who need more support.

1341
01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.206
And as well as with adults,
identify and be aware


1342
01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:30.121
so we can address it, so yeah.

1343
01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:34.473
So tell me, what's
been going on?


1344
01:05:34.517 --> 01:05:37.781
- Well, you know just kind of.

1345
01:05:37.825 --> 01:05:39.522
You know, working
through those things.


1346
01:05:39.566 --> 01:05:45.659
I got a position where I'm
subbing more frequently,


1347
01:05:45.702 --> 01:05:48.052
so that's let me not
have as much stress


1348
01:05:48.096 --> 01:05:49.401
and bringing in some income.

1349
01:05:49.445 --> 01:05:50.533
So that's good.

1350
01:05:50.577 --> 01:05:52.448
But you know I had a situation

1351
01:05:52.491 --> 01:05:56.757
where one of my brother's
car got shot up.


1352
01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:01.413
And you know I'm just
trying to not do something


1353
01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:02.937
that's gonna
jeopardize my future.


1354
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.634
- Mm hm.

1355
01:06:04.678 --> 01:06:09.596
- And it's just hard to
navigate those situations.


1356
01:06:09.639 --> 01:06:11.946
And do the right
thing sometimes.


1357
01:06:11.989 --> 01:06:13.948
So I'm just trying to
think my way through it


1358
01:06:13.991 --> 01:06:15.645
instead of just
being irrational.


1359
01:06:21.738 --> 01:06:26.700
What's up bro?

1360
01:06:28.005 --> 01:06:29.398
Man, I see you still
rocking them cowboy?


1361
01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:33.707
- Yo, baby we gonna
always be cowboys man.


1362
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:35.230
Paying child support,
I had to give extra


1363
01:06:35.273 --> 01:06:37.624
on top of what I
giving you already.


1364
01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:38.712
- They already asking for extra?

1365
01:06:38.755 --> 01:06:39.538
- Man, come on man.

1366
01:06:39.582 --> 01:06:41.497
Hey I got bills myself.

1367
01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:42.541
I gotta live!

1368
01:06:42.585 --> 01:06:43.586
- Right.

1369
01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:44.805
- But at the same time man,

1370
01:06:44.848 --> 01:06:46.807
I want to be able to any
and everything for them


1371
01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:49.810
but you know man, I've
been going through it bro.


1372
01:06:49.853 --> 01:06:51.246
I just need a little prayer man,

1373
01:06:51.289 --> 01:06:53.988
because I man trying to survive
out here on these streets,


1374
01:06:54.031 --> 01:06:55.990
and these streets out
here ain't calling me.


1375
01:06:56.033 --> 01:06:57.905
I'm trying to go
home and be with


1376
01:06:57.948 --> 01:06:59.820
the family and take
care of mine, but.


1377
01:06:59.863 --> 01:07:00.995
- Yeah, you know.

1378
01:07:01.038 --> 01:07:03.737
Everybody needs some
prayer sometimes man.


1379
01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.782
You know what, man I'll
pray for you right now.


1380
01:07:05.826 --> 01:07:07.218
- Man, please bro.

1381
01:07:07.262 --> 01:07:08.393
Thank you.

1382
01:07:08.437 --> 01:07:10.047
Take my hand and pray with me.

1383
01:07:10.091 --> 01:07:10.918
- For sure.

1384
01:07:10.961 --> 01:07:12.571
Dear heavenly father,

1385
01:07:12.615 --> 01:07:14.530
we pray that you keep your
hand on this young man.


1386
01:07:14.573 --> 01:07:15.836
- Yes sir.

1387
01:07:15.879 --> 01:07:17.098
- And let him be successful
in what he's doing.


1388
01:07:17.141 --> 01:07:19.535
Help him to build
and keep having


1389
01:07:19.578 --> 01:07:21.624
to break relationships
with his children,


1390
01:07:21.668 --> 01:07:23.800
make sure that his finances
are where they need to be.


1391
01:07:23.844 --> 01:07:25.497
And you keep your hands on him,

1392
01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:28.326
all of his stuff like we know
that you said that you would.


1393
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:31.808
And let him allow
you to lead his life


1394
01:07:31.852 --> 01:07:33.592
in the right direction
and make good decisions


1395
01:07:33.636 --> 01:07:34.942
that are gonna last a lifetime

1396
01:07:34.985 --> 01:07:36.726
and have generational value

1397
01:07:36.770 --> 01:07:38.380
and break generational curses,

1398
01:07:38.423 --> 01:07:41.209
and keep things all together
in love and glorify your name


1399
01:07:41.252 --> 01:07:42.340
and it'll all be for you.

1400
01:07:42.384 --> 01:07:43.820
In the name of Jesus amen.

1401
01:07:43.864 --> 01:07:45.169
- Amen, man.

1402
01:07:45.213 --> 01:07:46.518
Amen.

1403
01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:47.694
- Yeah, that's what it's
about right there man.


1404
01:07:47.737 --> 01:07:48.738
- Man, I appreciate that
man, I felt that man.


1405
01:07:48.782 --> 01:07:51.132
- 'Cause look, prayer
changes things.


1406
01:07:51.175 --> 01:07:52.742
That's the only thing
I know that works.


1407
01:07:52.786 --> 01:07:54.962
In my whole life, for real.

1408
01:07:55.005 --> 01:07:56.137
Prayer.

1409
01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:57.878
And talking I really
kind of believe in,


1410
01:07:57.921 --> 01:07:59.749
that it's bigger than me.

1411
01:07:59.793 --> 01:08:01.708
Because man, I done went
through so much in my life


1412
01:08:01.751 --> 01:08:03.971
now I see because I'm
helping other kids.


1413
01:08:04.014 --> 01:08:05.276
I wouldn't even know.

1414
01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.061
I would be like one
of these people come


1415
01:08:07.104 --> 01:08:10.194
from Montana, or Wyoming, that
ain't ever lived in the city.


1416
01:08:10.238 --> 01:08:14.068
That don't know about you
know helping somebody else.


1417
01:08:14.111 --> 01:08:15.765
Because they ain't
ever been in it.


1418
01:08:15.809 --> 01:08:16.984
- Right.

1419
01:08:17.027 --> 01:08:18.812
- And God just put me
in that position man,


1420
01:08:18.855 --> 01:08:24.731
and that just really
made me a better person.


1421
01:08:24.774 --> 01:08:26.341
To where it ain't
about me no more.


1422
01:08:26.384 --> 01:08:27.646
It's about the bigger
picture, what I can give back.


1423
01:08:27.690 --> 01:08:29.126
Because I be thinking,
I'm a die all the time,


1424
01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:32.782
I'd have been shot at,
ganged, all the crazy stuff


1425
01:08:32.826 --> 01:08:35.524
that happen and it's like,

1426
01:08:35.567 --> 01:08:36.960
am I supposed to be here?

1427
01:08:37.004 --> 01:08:38.701
You know?

1428
01:08:38.745 --> 01:08:41.617
And then when God give you
different opportunities


1429
01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:46.404
to let you cash in on
why he even got you here.


1430
01:08:46.448 --> 01:08:47.754
That right there man.

1431
01:08:47.797 --> 01:08:51.279
It really been helpful
for me in my life.


1432
01:08:51.322 --> 01:08:52.802
Man, I'm a keep
praying for you man.


1433
01:08:52.846 --> 01:08:54.021
- Man, really man.

1434
01:08:54.064 --> 01:08:55.805
- You gotta come over to
the house man, for sure.


1435
01:08:55.849 --> 01:08:57.067
- Man, I'm a have
to come over there.


1436
01:08:57.111 --> 01:08:59.069
- I got a small chess
board, it ain't super nice.


1437
01:08:59.113 --> 01:09:00.767
- We gonna get us a
big old chess board.


1438
01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:01.811
- I need a minute.

1439
01:09:01.855 --> 01:09:02.943
- You don't have
to worry about it.


1440
01:09:02.986 --> 01:09:06.729
- Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1441
01:09:06.773 --> 01:09:08.470
- We put a couple of
them in the alley,


1442
01:09:08.513 --> 01:09:10.689
you know how it look
good all the time.


1443
01:09:10.733 --> 01:09:12.779
And say a few more
prayers for a man


1444
01:09:12.822 --> 01:09:13.823
because I'm about
to make it out here.


1445
01:09:13.867 --> 01:09:16.304
Ain't gonna let this
situation stop me,


1446
01:09:16.347 --> 01:09:18.175
because there ain't
nothing out here


1447
01:09:18.219 --> 01:09:19.481
gonna be able to stop me.

1448
01:09:19.524 --> 01:09:20.787
Only person that can
stop you is yourself.


1449
01:09:20.830 --> 01:09:21.831
I don't believe in that,

1450
01:09:21.875 --> 01:09:23.354
yeah because the
system trying to,


1451
01:09:23.398 --> 01:09:25.661
and they trying to do it
in the system and stuff.


1452
01:09:25.704 --> 01:09:27.184
You know all it
ain't gonna stop me.


1453
01:09:27.228 --> 01:09:28.577
Hey what it do Charles,

1454
01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.883
what's up with you baby?

1455
01:09:29.926 --> 01:09:31.449
- How about them Cowboys?

1456
01:09:31.493 --> 01:09:32.711
- Oh my god.

1457
01:09:32.755 --> 01:09:34.757
[laughs]

1458
01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:42.983
- Man, but yeah man.

1459
01:09:43.026 --> 01:09:45.115
When it's all over
said and done man.


1460
01:09:45.159 --> 01:09:47.596
I'm a step foot out here
and I'm gonna make it.


1461
01:09:47.639 --> 01:09:48.727
- You ain't got
no choice but to.


1462
01:09:48.771 --> 01:09:50.164
You got people riding on you.

1463
01:09:50.207 --> 01:09:51.513
Waiting on you.

1464
01:09:51.556 --> 01:09:55.169
Right, you got you just
trying to get the food.


1465
01:10:00.217 --> 01:10:02.089
- I hate to see the
backside of you.


1466
01:10:02.132 --> 01:10:05.048
Is walking away from me
what you really wanna do?


1467
01:10:05.092 --> 01:10:07.442
You're a sight for sore
eyes and I love any of you.


1468
01:10:07.485 --> 01:10:10.010
But I know it's not polite
if I keep staring at you.


1469
01:10:10.053 --> 01:10:13.622
So hello lady, hi can I
please stand by your side?


1470
01:10:13.665 --> 01:10:14.971
And I'm sorry if I disrespected,

1471
01:10:15.015 --> 01:10:16.755
my approach can be corrected.

1472
01:10:16.799 --> 01:10:18.714
Seeing the back of
you had me affected


1473
01:10:18.757 --> 01:10:21.238
but don't walk away from,
my mind would be hectic.


1474
01:10:21.282 --> 01:10:24.198
To know that our heart's
time will be neglected.


1475
01:10:24.241 --> 01:10:26.853
So I'm daydreaming of us
being spiritually connected,


1476
01:10:26.896 --> 01:10:29.899
so here pouring out my
soul is how I left it.


1477
01:10:29.943 --> 01:10:30.595
- Okay.

1478
01:10:32.684 --> 01:10:33.772
My goodness.

1479
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:35.949
That's awesome.

1480
01:10:35.992 --> 01:10:37.602
[chuckles]

1481
01:10:37.646 --> 01:10:38.821
I was not prepared.

1482
01:10:38.865 --> 01:10:42.825
I didn't know you had
that in you, like what?


1483
01:10:42.869 --> 01:10:43.478
What?

1484
01:10:44.958 --> 01:10:46.960
You a little poet hon.

1485
01:10:47.003 --> 01:10:49.310
- There's a whole lot more
I'm trying to show you.


1486
01:10:49.353 --> 01:10:51.138
- Little poet, who knew?

1487
01:10:52.879 --> 01:10:54.706
- But look.

1488
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:57.013
There's something I
need to tell you though.


1489
01:10:57.057 --> 01:10:58.145
- Tell me what?

1490
01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:01.496
What's up?

1491
01:11:01.539 --> 01:11:02.714
- I don't know how to say it.

1492
01:11:06.109 --> 01:11:09.243
- Just say what's on your
mind babe, what's up?


1493
01:11:10.809 --> 01:11:12.507
- I really care about you.

1494
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:14.988
I'm here with you in
this relationship.


1495
01:11:17.033 --> 01:11:18.513
We about to have a baby.

1496
01:11:20.863 --> 01:11:23.126
And I feel like I need
to be 100% with you.


1497
01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:23.822
- As you should.

1498
01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:29.567
What's up?

1499
01:11:29.611 --> 01:11:31.047
Just talk.

1500
01:11:31.091 --> 01:11:32.919
Can't be that serious, like.

1501
01:11:32.962 --> 01:11:33.832
What's up?

1502
01:11:33.876 --> 01:11:34.616
- My ex came by my house.

1503
01:11:38.141 --> 01:11:38.925
- Mm hm?

1504
01:11:40.883 --> 01:11:43.059
- And she told me
she was pregnant


1505
01:11:44.669 --> 01:11:47.150
- Okay, that has
nothing to do with you.


1506
01:11:47.194 --> 01:11:48.891
What that gotta do with you?

1507
01:11:48.935 --> 01:11:50.849
- She's saying it's mine.

1508
01:11:50.893 --> 01:11:52.329
- What?

1509
01:11:52.373 --> 01:11:54.114
No, Marvin.

1510
01:11:54.157 --> 01:11:54.897
No.

1511
01:11:54.941 --> 01:11:56.290
Are you kidding me?

1512
01:11:56.333 --> 01:11:57.421
So you been still
messing with her?


1513
01:11:57.465 --> 01:11:58.945
- No.
- Are you serious?


1514
01:11:58.988 --> 01:12:00.076
- I ain't even.

1515
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:00.990
- Does she know about me?

1516
01:12:01.034 --> 01:12:02.339
Does she know we got a baby?

1517
01:12:02.383 --> 01:12:03.950
Does she know you got
this to take care of?


1518
01:12:03.993 --> 01:12:06.517
Like, how could you do this?

1519
01:12:07.475 --> 01:12:09.346
Like are you serious, no!

1520
01:12:09.390 --> 01:12:12.654
So you gonna mess with her.

1521
01:12:12.697 --> 01:12:14.003
- I wasn't messing with her.

1522
01:12:14.047 --> 01:12:15.613
- Really, you gonna
get her pregnant?


1523
01:12:15.657 --> 01:12:16.527
- It was like seven months ago.

1524
01:12:16.571 --> 01:12:17.702
- So you gonna leave me for her.

1525
01:12:17.746 --> 01:12:18.965
- No, I'm not
leaving you for her.


1526
01:12:19.008 --> 01:12:20.749
- Well then why you
still messing with her?


1527
01:12:20.792 --> 01:12:22.055
- You're not listening to what

1528
01:12:22.098 --> 01:12:23.317
I'm saying about how
I feel about you?


1529
01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:24.883
- Well you ain't
said nothing to me.


1530
01:12:24.927 --> 01:12:26.711
And it's not about your words,
it's about your actions.


1531
01:12:26.755 --> 01:12:27.974
- My actions, baby look.

1532
01:12:28.017 --> 01:12:29.236
I done got you a
ring and everything.


1533
01:12:29.279 --> 01:12:30.628
I'm serious about us.

1534
01:12:31.803 --> 01:12:33.414
Yo, I want us to be together.

1535
01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:43.728
- I don't want it like this.

1536
01:12:43.772 --> 01:12:45.948
Not like this.

1537
01:12:45.992 --> 01:12:47.819
- We gonna make it work.

1538
01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:49.908
We gonna make it work.

1539
01:12:49.952 --> 01:12:51.171
We gonna make it work.

1540
01:12:51.214 --> 01:12:52.433
- Not like this.

1541
01:12:54.348 --> 01:12:55.958
- Yo, I'm gonna be here
for you and the baby.


1542
01:13:01.833 --> 01:13:03.879
That's why I love you.

1543
01:13:03.922 --> 01:13:04.836
I'm sorry.

1544
01:13:16.674 --> 01:13:18.024
- You know so I'm learning,

1545
01:13:18.067 --> 01:13:19.590
like I look at this
theory of the sponge.


1546
01:13:19.634 --> 01:13:21.940
To where I take in everything
everybody does around me,


1547
01:13:21.984 --> 01:13:23.333
all the people I care about.

1548
01:13:23.377 --> 01:13:25.335
All the people
that influence me.


1549
01:13:25.379 --> 01:13:28.208
And things that I can
benefit from, I keep in.


1550
01:13:28.251 --> 01:13:30.471
But I squeeze out
all the things that


1551
01:13:30.514 --> 01:13:33.300
I feel like are not beneficial
to me, and not gonna help me.


1552
01:13:33.343 --> 01:13:35.084
And you know, I cast those away.

1553
01:13:35.128 --> 01:13:36.781
That way I can keep the
good and expel the bad.


1554
01:13:36.825 --> 01:13:38.522
Because it's not
necessarily what you put out


1555
01:13:38.566 --> 01:13:40.220
but what you got in.

1556
01:13:40.263 --> 01:13:41.003
So that's my theory.

1557
01:13:41.047 --> 01:13:42.265
- That's amazing.

1558
01:13:42.309 --> 01:13:45.181
I'm gonna give
you a great quote,


1559
01:13:45.225 --> 01:13:46.617
that you know how
we got different


1560
01:13:46.661 --> 01:13:47.966
people got different quotes.

1561
01:13:48.010 --> 01:13:49.577
I'm gonna give you
an Uncle D quote.


1562
01:13:49.620 --> 01:13:50.795
That I over the years, I use.

1563
01:13:50.839 --> 01:13:53.798
I came upon it when I
was in college 'cause.


1564
01:13:53.842 --> 01:13:55.844
What I did in college, is I was,

1565
01:13:55.887 --> 01:13:58.716
a big fish in a little pond
I went to a small college.


1566
01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:01.806
I was successful, and I
went and had a big hit.


1567
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:03.765
Never allow a reaction

1568
01:14:03.808 --> 01:14:06.898
to an attraction
create a distraction.


1569
01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:07.986
Maintain your focus.

1570
01:14:08.030 --> 01:14:08.857
- Say that again,
say that again.


1571
01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:10.163
- You're on point right now,

1572
01:14:10.206 --> 01:14:12.643
doing some great things,
God is blessing you


1573
01:14:12.687 --> 01:14:13.862
and has blessed you.

1574
01:14:13.905 --> 01:14:16.778
Never allow a reaction
to an attraction


1575
01:14:16.821 --> 01:14:18.780
create a distraction.

1576
01:14:18.823 --> 01:14:20.956
So in other words,
something over here,


1577
01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:22.175
for me it was girls.

1578
01:14:22.218 --> 01:14:23.176
In college --

1579
01:14:23.219 --> 01:14:24.525
- For me it's girls too!

1580
01:14:24.568 --> 01:14:26.092
- Reacting to those,
seeing an attraction


1581
01:14:26.135 --> 01:14:28.616
and reacting to it takes
me away from my focus


1582
01:14:28.659 --> 01:14:29.878
of what I was doing.

1583
01:14:29.921 --> 01:14:31.532
I need to maintain
my focus, do my work.


1584
01:14:31.575 --> 01:14:32.837
What I'm supposed
to do at school.


1585
01:14:32.881 --> 01:14:34.883
And study and do
all those things.


1586
01:14:34.926 --> 01:14:36.885
So that attraction
can take you away


1587
01:14:36.928 --> 01:14:38.539
from what your commitment to do.

1588
01:14:38.582 --> 01:14:39.844
So stay committed
to what you do.


1589
01:14:39.888 --> 01:14:40.889
Maintain your focus.

1590
01:14:40.932 --> 01:14:41.846
And then...

1591
01:14:43.587 --> 01:14:44.632
- Man it wasn't over.

1592
01:14:46.242 --> 01:14:47.722
- Man, I'm a put
on my shades dude.


1593
01:14:47.765 --> 01:14:49.767
- Man you don't need
to put on them shades.


1594
01:14:49.811 --> 01:14:51.160
- Man, see what I just did.

1595
01:14:51.204 --> 01:14:53.597

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.481
Oh, yeah.

Let me tell you this man.

1602
01:15:08.873 --> 01:15:11.746
I got a call from Mr. Howe.

1603
01:15:11.789 --> 01:15:13.226
You know he does
performances and stuff.

01:15:13.269 --> 01:15:15.010
And they got this
performance coming up.

You gonna get up there with me?

We can do like a duality
flow thing or something?


1611
01:15:24.672 --> 01:15:25.890
It'd be dope.

01:15:25.934 --> 01:15:27.022
- Man, we done talked

1614
01:15:28.763 --> 01:15:29.938

1615
01:15:29.981 --> 01:15:31.418

I appreciate you

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:13.433

Hey, is this Mr. Robertson?

Miller from school.

- Oh hey Miss Miller.

1646
01:17:21.571 --> 01:17:23.269
- Well, I was just calling you

1647
01:17:23.312 --> 01:17:24.922
because I'm getting ready
to go on maternity leave


1648
01:17:24.966 --> 01:17:27.055
in a couple of weeks and I
had spoke to the principle


1649
01:17:27.098 --> 01:17:30.276
here at school and I
was trying to get you


1650
01:17:30.319 --> 01:17:33.844
a permanent substitution
position job until the end of


1651
01:17:33.888 --> 01:17:36.499
the school year, how do
you feel about doing that?


1652
01:17:36.543 --> 01:17:37.152
- Really?

1653
01:17:38.066 --> 01:17:38.893
Oh wow.

1654
01:17:40.416 --> 01:17:42.592
That is awesome.

1655
01:17:42.636 --> 01:17:43.898
Thank you so much.

1656
01:17:44.986 --> 01:17:46.553
Yes.

1657
01:17:46.596 --> 01:17:47.293
Absolutely.

1658
01:17:48.816 --> 01:17:49.643
I appreciate you.

1659
01:17:57.738 --> 01:17:58.956
- [Teacher] And we're
going to switch up,


1660
01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.046
so that the next
group can come paint.


1661
01:18:16.757 --> 01:18:18.802

[phone rings]

1663
01:19:02.193 --> 01:19:02.977
- Hello?

1664
01:19:04.152 --> 01:19:05.762
Oh hey Miss Miller.

1665
01:19:05.806 --> 01:19:08.069
- You know Mr. Robertson,
the kids love you.


1666
01:19:08.112 --> 01:19:10.463
And you always do a good job.

1667
01:19:10.506 --> 01:19:11.768
So what I'm gonna do,

1668
01:19:11.812 --> 01:19:14.771
I'm gonna leave the
lesson plans laid out for


1669
01:19:14.815 --> 01:19:16.338
the next five weeks, and
I think we're gonna have


1670
01:19:16.382 --> 01:19:18.035
a position for you
next school year.


1671
01:19:18.079 --> 01:19:19.602
I'll talk to the principal.

1672
01:19:19.646 --> 01:19:21.474
Several teachers are leaving,

1673
01:19:21.517 --> 01:19:24.564
so if you do a good job,
the position could be yours.


1674
01:19:24.607 --> 01:19:28.568
So just make sure that
you're on your P's and Q's.


1675
01:19:28.611 --> 01:19:30.004
- Yes, absolutely.

1676
01:19:30.047 --> 01:19:33.790
I will be on my P's
and Q's everyday.


1677
01:19:33.834 --> 01:19:34.487
Yes.

1678
01:19:35.662 --> 01:19:37.751
Tell them yes.

1679
01:19:37.794 --> 01:19:39.796
Thank you for the opportunity.

1680
01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.189
- No problem, thank you so much.

1681
01:19:41.232 --> 01:19:42.364
And I will see you soon.

1682
01:19:46.673 --> 01:19:47.891
[sighs]

1683
01:19:47.935 --> 01:19:49.197
- Lord, thank you.

Thank you thank you thank you.

1685
01:19:51.852 --> 01:19:55.943
I know two times I tried to
lead to my own understanding.


1686
01:19:55.986 --> 01:19:57.771
Lord, you're always on time.

1687
01:19:57.814 --> 01:19:59.381
Thank you so much.

1688
01:19:59.425 --> 01:20:00.730
I really appreciate
the opportunity.


1689
01:20:00.774 --> 01:20:02.471
I won't let you down.

1690
01:20:02.515 --> 01:20:03.167
Thank you lord.

1691
01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.343
Amen.

1692
01:20:15.658 --> 01:20:16.877
- Bro, I heard you
talking about my momma.


1693
01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.748
You don't be doing that bro.

1694
01:20:18.792 --> 01:20:19.967
- [Kid] What you
gonna do about it?


1695
01:20:20.010 --> 01:20:21.359
- I'm gonna fight you.

1696
01:20:21.403 --> 01:20:22.230
Come on, square up.

1697
01:20:22.273 --> 01:20:24.362
- Mr. Robertson?

1698
01:20:24.406 --> 01:20:26.756
- This Mr. Robertson.

1699
01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.803
- There's about to be a
fight on the first floor.


1700
01:20:29.846 --> 01:20:31.457
- Okay, I'm on my way.

1701
01:20:36.113 --> 01:20:37.854
- You don't want none
of this small fry.


1702
01:20:37.898 --> 01:20:40.074
- Hey hey hey, man

Y'all too big for this.

1704
01:20:44.818 --> 01:20:45.775
What's going on?

1705
01:20:49.387 --> 01:20:50.737
- He was talking about my
momma and I don't like it.


1706
01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:53.740
It gets me like mad
talking about my momma.


1707
01:20:53.783 --> 01:20:56.003
- You know his momma?

1708
01:20:57.657 --> 01:20:58.832
- Does he know your momma?

1709
01:20:58.875 --> 01:21:00.094
- No.

1710
01:21:00.137 --> 01:21:01.835
- So every time somebody
say something about you


1711
01:21:01.878 --> 01:21:04.098
you don't like,
y'all gonna fight?


1712
01:21:04.141 --> 01:21:05.447
- No.

1713
01:21:05.491 --> 01:21:06.883
- See 'cause when
I was y'all age,


1714
01:21:06.927 --> 01:21:09.843
man, I ended up having
to go to juvenile.


1715
01:21:09.886 --> 01:21:11.758
Get put in handcuffs.

1716
01:21:11.801 --> 01:21:13.890
Went to alternative
school for a year.


1717
01:21:13.934 --> 01:21:15.152
That's not what
I want for y'all.


1718
01:21:15.196 --> 01:21:16.066
Y'all know what's
happening to kids like


1719
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:18.155
y'all in the streets right now?

1720
01:21:18.199 --> 01:21:19.200
- They're dying?

1721
01:21:19.243 --> 01:21:20.201
- What's happening?

1722
01:21:20.244 --> 01:21:21.681
- They're dying like he said.

1723
01:21:21.724 --> 01:21:24.248
They keep getting shot at 'cause

1724
01:21:24.292 --> 01:21:25.772
they wanna start
stuff like this.


1725
01:21:25.815 --> 01:21:27.077
- And that's what you wanna do?

1726
01:21:27.121 --> 01:21:28.905
- No.

1727
01:21:28.949 --> 01:21:29.993
- That's what you wanna do?

1728
01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:35.346
So look, I see your grades
and your test scores.


1729
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:37.740
I see your grades
and your test scores.


1730
01:21:37.784 --> 01:21:41.004
Y'all are too smart
for this mess.


1731
01:21:41.048 --> 01:21:42.397
Too smart.

1732
01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:43.790
You gonna learn, you
gonna have to learn


1733
01:21:43.833 --> 01:21:45.879
how to control your emotions,

1734
01:21:45.922 --> 01:21:47.794
you have to learn how
to control your anger.


1735
01:21:47.837 --> 01:21:50.274
Because if you don't,
you're gonna be a statistic.


1736
01:21:50.318 --> 01:21:51.232
And that's not what
I want for you.


1737
01:21:51.275 --> 01:21:53.321
Y'all are both black men.

1738
01:21:53.364 --> 01:21:55.236
Y'all gonna grow up and
be black men anyway.


1739
01:21:55.279 --> 01:21:57.847
Right now y'all acting
like little boys.


1740
01:21:57.891 --> 01:21:58.979
Y'all gotta do better than this.

1741
01:21:59.022 --> 01:21:59.893
- Yes sir.

1742
01:21:59.936 --> 01:22:00.850
- Do you understand me?

1743
01:22:00.894 --> 01:22:01.808
- Yes sir.

1744
01:22:01.851 --> 01:22:02.896
- Do you understand me?

1745
01:22:02.939 --> 01:22:03.897
- Yes sir.

1746
01:22:03.940 --> 01:22:06.508
- Now this can't happen no more.

1747
01:22:06.552 --> 01:22:07.988
Do I need to go ahead
and just suspend y'all?


1748
01:22:08.031 --> 01:22:09.772
Put y'all out of school
so you can learn a lesson?


1749
01:22:09.816 --> 01:22:11.774
- No.
- No sir.


1750
01:22:11.818 --> 01:22:12.775
- Do we need to call your momma?

1751
01:22:12.819 --> 01:22:13.689
- No sir.

1752
01:22:13.733 --> 01:22:14.342
- Do we need to call your momma?

1753
01:22:14.385 --> 01:22:15.299
Are you sure?

1754
01:22:15.343 --> 01:22:16.692
- Yes.

1755
01:22:16.736 --> 01:22:18.912
- Because this mess
need to be over with.


1756
01:22:18.955 --> 01:22:20.130
Is it over with?

1757
01:22:21.088 --> 01:22:21.958
Shake hands.

1758
01:22:23.699 --> 01:22:24.787
Now I don't want to
see this mess no more.


1759
01:22:24.831 --> 01:22:25.875
Go your separate ways.

1760
01:22:27.964 --> 01:22:29.052
Acting crazy.

1761
01:22:43.023 --> 01:22:43.980
- Man what's up my people.

1762
01:22:44.024 --> 01:22:45.678
- [Keenan] What's up with you?

1763
01:22:45.721 --> 01:22:47.680
- Oh man, long time no see man!

1764
01:22:47.723 --> 01:22:48.768
What's up cos?

1765
01:22:51.379 --> 01:22:52.249
What's up bro?

1766
01:22:52.293 --> 01:22:53.729
You know I love you man.

1767
01:22:53.773 --> 01:22:54.861
- [Marvin] Come on get your hug.

1768
01:22:54.904 --> 01:22:55.731
Yeah!

1769
01:22:58.516 --> 01:22:59.909
Who you got here?

1770
01:22:59.953 --> 01:23:00.823
- Yeah?

1771
01:23:01.998 --> 01:23:03.826
- Dayton and Dulsa?

1772
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:05.959
- [Marvin] Dayton, Dulsa
y'all look like some twins.


1773
01:23:06.002 --> 01:23:06.829
- Like some twins!

1774
01:23:06.873 --> 01:23:07.743
- They are!

1775
01:23:07.787 --> 01:23:08.744
- They are twins!

1776
01:23:08.788 --> 01:23:09.789
Those my twins!

1777
01:23:09.832 --> 01:23:11.094
Brother got twins!

1778
01:23:11.138 --> 01:23:13.053
Brother got twins!

1779
01:23:13.096 --> 01:23:15.229
Twins, twins twins!

1780
01:23:15.272 --> 01:23:18.624
- Lord, this is
a message to you.


1781
01:23:18.667 --> 01:23:19.973
I don't know what else to do.

1782
01:23:20.016 --> 01:23:21.409
And I speak for my crew,

1783
01:23:21.452 --> 01:23:23.106
'cause this is what
we all going through.


1784
01:23:23.150 --> 01:23:24.717
Our pain runs deep.

1785
01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:25.631
- How deep?

1786
01:23:25.674 --> 01:23:26.980
- So deep I can't even sleep.

1787
01:23:27.023 --> 01:23:29.939
Tossing and turning,
chest burning.


1788
01:23:29.983 --> 01:23:31.419
Why's this all we're earning.

1789
01:23:32.812 --> 01:23:34.944
Nine to five, minimum wage,

1790
01:23:34.988 --> 01:23:36.598
man is this why I'm working?

1791
01:23:36.642 --> 01:23:39.906
I'm living check
by check, stressed,


1792
01:23:39.949 --> 01:23:41.298
but blessed to be living.

1793
01:23:41.342 --> 01:23:43.736
I'm still willing to strive,

1794
01:23:43.779 --> 01:23:46.303
prospect these means to beings.

1795
01:23:46.347 --> 01:23:48.392
But that lifestyle
involves some dirty dealing


1796
01:23:48.436 --> 01:23:49.437
that's not appealing.

1797
01:23:50.743 --> 01:23:52.875
A storm cloud's covering
my mental vision.


1798
01:23:55.399 --> 01:23:56.923
It still burns.

1799
01:23:56.966 --> 01:23:58.489
The world still turns.

1800
01:23:59.926 --> 01:24:03.930
As we get closer to the end
of our worldly life terms.


1801
01:24:03.973 --> 01:24:08.238
And these are the
days of our lives.


1802
01:24:08.282 --> 01:24:09.805
As the world turns.

1803
01:24:11.502 --> 01:24:17.683
- These are the days of our
lives as the world turns.


1804
01:24:17.726 --> 01:24:21.730
I sit still and my mind travels
a million miles a minute.


1805
01:24:21.774 --> 01:24:24.907
I'm thinking about the
world and how we fit in it.


1806
01:24:24.951 --> 01:24:26.996
We're just really mere molecules

1807
01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.868
and we need earthly
things to survive.


1808
01:24:28.911 --> 01:24:30.217
- To survive.

1809
01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:31.653
- And I strive to
appreciate all life


1810
01:24:31.697 --> 01:24:33.916
which helps me stay alive.

1811
01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.702
If there was no food
chain, you couldn't eat.


1812
01:24:36.745 --> 01:24:39.705
So you can't say that you
stand on your own feet.


1813
01:24:39.748 --> 01:24:42.142
If there was no gravity we'd
all be floating and go away.


1814
01:24:42.185 --> 01:24:43.056
So let's make this world better

1815
01:24:43.099 --> 01:24:44.797
and not just try to maintain.

1816
01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:47.277
And these things could drive
a thoughtful person to pain.


1817
01:24:47.321 --> 01:24:48.670
And doctors could give you drugs

1818
01:24:48.714 --> 01:24:50.280
and diagnose of this
loose in your brain.


1819
01:24:50.324 --> 01:24:52.979
When you hunger for good
I bet you find pain.


1820
01:24:53.022 --> 01:24:56.243
And then you find others
who like you feel the same.


1821
01:24:56.286 --> 01:24:58.636
And these are just the
small pieces of emotions


1822
01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.421
that run through my brain.

1823
01:25:00.464 --> 01:25:03.076
[low tempo music]

1824
01:25:30.756 --> 01:25:33.715
- To give us a
space to try things


1825
01:25:33.759 --> 01:25:36.065
and do things and
discover who is


1826
01:25:36.109 --> 01:25:38.807
that they need to be,
and who needs to be out.


1827
01:25:38.851 --> 01:25:43.072
They give us a machine that
can fail in those spaces


1828
01:25:44.987 --> 01:25:48.469
but the family
gives us that space.


1829
01:25:48.512 --> 01:25:52.168
And they fail to describe
a fraction of the hope


1830
01:25:52.212 --> 01:25:54.040
sometimes it's what's necessary.

1831
01:25:54.083 --> 01:25:58.044
Sometimes we it's odd,
but we feel we need to do.


1832
01:26:31.773 --> 01:26:33.688
- Hey Miss Corlowe,
tell Mr. Robertson


1833
01:26:33.731 --> 01:26:34.820
that I'm ready for him.

1834
01:26:38.824 --> 01:26:39.737
- [Keenan] How you doing doc?

1835
01:26:39.781 --> 01:26:40.913
- Nice to see you.

1836
01:26:40.956 --> 01:26:41.957
- [Keenan] Absolutely.

1837
01:26:42.001 --> 01:26:42.958
- Have a seat for
me, have a seat.


1838
01:26:43.002 --> 01:26:44.351
- Yes sir.

1839
01:26:44.394 --> 01:26:46.135
- So, I've been
watching you work


1840
01:26:46.179 --> 01:26:48.268
obviously over the
last couple of months.


1841
01:26:48.311 --> 01:26:51.227
Our boys and girls love you.

1842
01:26:51.271 --> 01:26:54.230
Every time I sit down and have
a conversation with a parent


1843
01:26:54.274 --> 01:26:57.538
they consistently tell me
that you're making connections


1844
01:26:57.581 --> 01:26:59.192
with the boys and girls.

1845
01:26:59.235 --> 01:27:01.411
And you're pushing
them to new heights.


1846
01:27:01.455 --> 01:27:04.458
As you know we have a
teacher that's retiring


1847
01:27:04.501 --> 01:27:05.894
at the end of the school year.

1848
01:27:05.938 --> 01:27:08.897
And I would like to
just formally offer you


1849
01:27:08.941 --> 01:27:11.247
a position to join our team.

1850
01:27:11.291 --> 01:27:12.422
- Wow.

1851
01:27:12.466 --> 01:27:13.380
Thank you.

1852
01:27:13.423 --> 01:27:14.642
Absolutely, yes sir.

1853
01:27:14.685 --> 01:27:16.165
I'm, yes.

1854
01:27:16.209 --> 01:27:17.558
What do I need to do?

1855
01:27:17.601 --> 01:27:19.908
- So there's a couple
of steps I can take.


1856
01:27:19.952 --> 01:27:22.041
Obviously we gonna make the
offer at the school level.


1857
01:27:22.084 --> 01:27:24.957
Our HR department
will reach out to you.


1858
01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.959
They'll make the official offer

1859
01:27:27.002 --> 01:27:29.613
and talk salary, compensation.

1860
01:27:29.657 --> 01:27:32.790
And then you'll accept
the job with them.


1861
01:27:32.834 --> 01:27:35.228
But I'm excited to have
you as part of the team.


1862
01:27:35.271 --> 01:27:36.098
I know you gonna
change lives here.


1863
01:27:36.142 --> 01:27:38.100
- Thank you, look thank you.

1864
01:27:38.144 --> 01:27:39.710
Man I appreciate
y'all getting me.


1865
01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:40.929
I've been praying for a job.

1866
01:27:43.105 --> 01:27:46.108
This is a blessing, I
really appreciate you.


1867
01:27:46.152 --> 01:27:47.805
- Well, my pleasure.

1868
01:27:47.849 --> 01:27:48.806
We're looking forward to seeing
how you change lives here.


1869
01:27:48.850 --> 01:27:50.852
- Yes sir, thank you.

1870
01:27:50.896 --> 01:27:51.766
- All right.

1871
01:27:57.728 --> 01:27:59.513
- [Keenan] Oh man,
what's up with you bro?


1872
01:27:59.556 --> 01:28:00.949
- What's going on?

1873
01:28:00.993 --> 01:28:04.039
- I'm chilling man,
I'm chilling you know.


1874
01:28:04.083 --> 01:28:05.606
Woo.

1875
01:28:05.649 --> 01:28:06.955
So what's been up with you?

1876
01:28:06.999 --> 01:28:08.217
What you got going on?

1877
01:28:08.261 --> 01:28:09.218
What you reading over
there, the Bible?


1878
01:28:09.262 --> 01:28:10.480
- Yeah, reading the Bible.

1879
01:28:11.873 --> 01:28:14.180
Trying to find some
inspiration for my poetry book.


1880
01:28:14.223 --> 01:28:15.311
- Okay, okay.

1881
01:28:15.355 --> 01:28:18.575
Where you at in there?

1882
01:28:18.619 --> 01:28:20.882
- Genesis 22.

1883
01:28:20.926 --> 01:28:22.753
- Oh okay, oh you already
got this one marked off on me


1884
01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:24.103
you must knew.

1885
01:28:24.146 --> 01:28:25.756
[laughs]

1886
01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.193
All right.

1887
01:28:27.236 --> 01:28:28.890
- Yeah.

1888
01:28:28.934 --> 01:28:31.501
- Oh man guess what, I got
some good news though bro.


1889
01:28:31.545 --> 01:28:32.938
- What happened, what's
going on with you?


1890
01:28:32.981 --> 01:28:36.506
- Man, today you know I been
subbing at my job and stuff.


1891
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:37.986
- Yeah, I see you
looking all clean.


1892
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:39.509
- Right, right,
right right right.


1893
01:28:39.553 --> 01:28:41.120
Principal called
me into the office,


1894
01:28:41.163 --> 01:28:43.252
I'm thinking like man I'm
probably in trouble or something


1895
01:28:43.296 --> 01:28:45.646
man because you know I'm
in there going hamburgers,


1896
01:28:45.689 --> 01:28:48.127
you know telling kids to
stop, get your life together.


1897
01:28:49.955 --> 01:28:51.695
- But you off in
the projects though.


1898
01:28:51.739 --> 01:28:53.828
- Right, deep off in the hood.

1899
01:28:53.871 --> 01:28:56.352
But you know I can relate
to those kind of kids.


1900
01:28:56.396 --> 01:28:57.832
And that's what he said.

1901
01:28:57.875 --> 01:28:59.834
He was like look, Mr. Robertson

1902
01:28:59.877 --> 01:29:01.270
you been doing a good job

1903
01:29:01.314 --> 01:29:03.272
and parents giving me good
compliments about you.


1904
01:29:03.316 --> 01:29:05.274
We got a teacher retiring,

1905
01:29:05.318 --> 01:29:07.059
we want you to come
work full time for us.


1906
01:29:07.102 --> 01:29:09.409
Yeah, he offered me
the job today man!


1907
01:29:09.452 --> 01:29:11.367
I was like, woo!

1908
01:29:11.411 --> 01:29:12.629
Hallelujah!

1909
01:29:12.673 --> 01:29:14.414
God bless you, be
like yes sir, yes sir!


1910
01:29:14.457 --> 01:29:15.937
- Right right man.

1911
01:29:15.981 --> 01:29:17.286
Man, God bless you.

1912
01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:19.723
What you gonna do with
all that product you got?


1913
01:29:19.767 --> 01:29:21.203
- Oh, you talking about that?

1914
01:29:21.247 --> 01:29:22.988
- I mean.

1915
01:29:23.031 --> 01:29:24.902
- Okay, so this is
what I'm thinking.


1916
01:29:24.946 --> 01:29:27.644
I talked to little man TI.

1917
01:29:27.688 --> 01:29:29.211
And they told me just
give him the bread


1918
01:29:29.255 --> 01:29:30.821
for what I got rid of,

1919
01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.649
but for the rest of the stuff
you know, I can take back.


1920
01:29:32.693 --> 01:29:33.955
And they said
they'd take it back.


1921
01:29:33.999 --> 01:29:35.261
You know, they don't
normally do that.


1922
01:29:35.304 --> 01:29:36.958
There ain't no
refunds in the hood.


1923
01:29:37.002 --> 01:29:38.394
- Hey, but he didn't really
want you to take it no ways.


1924
01:29:38.438 --> 01:29:39.265
- Right right.

1925
01:29:39.308 --> 01:29:40.918
- That's real love right there.

1926
01:29:40.962 --> 01:29:42.311
- Right, I didn't really
wanna go that way anyway.


1927
01:29:42.355 --> 01:29:44.357
Kind of like, kind of like
every hymn in this psalm.


1928
01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.575
Like the ram and the bush.

1929
01:29:45.619 --> 01:29:47.055
You know God gave me an outlet

1930
01:29:47.099 --> 01:29:49.101
to where I didn't have to do,

1931
01:29:49.144 --> 01:29:51.799
you know, 'cause I didn't
really want to do that.


1932
01:29:51.842 --> 01:29:52.713
- Right.

1933
01:29:52.756 --> 01:29:53.801
- That's a lot of risk.

1934
01:29:53.844 --> 01:29:55.933
- You was gonna
sacrifice your freedom.


1935
01:29:55.977 --> 01:29:56.717
- Freedom.

1936
01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:57.674
Right.

1937
01:29:57.718 --> 01:29:58.762
In my life and everything else.

1938
01:29:58.806 --> 01:29:59.546
- Right.

1939
01:29:59.589 --> 01:30:00.503
- To get money.

1940
01:30:00.547 --> 01:30:01.852
- Right, trying to survive.

1941
01:30:01.896 --> 01:30:02.766
- Right.

1942
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:04.420
But you know Bob Marley said,

1943
01:30:04.464 --> 01:30:08.120
Bob Marley said
numbers are endless.


1944
01:30:08.163 --> 01:30:10.557
So if you're searching for
numbers for your happiness,


1945
01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:12.559
you ain't never gonna be happy.

1946
01:30:12.602 --> 01:30:15.040
So you know it just kind of
made me think about that.


1947
01:30:15.083 --> 01:30:16.432
- Well let me think
about that for a second.


1948
01:30:16.476 --> 01:30:17.259
- Yeah man.

1949
01:30:17.303 --> 01:30:18.043
- Man, wow.

1950
01:30:18.086 --> 01:30:18.826
- Yeah man.

1951
01:30:18.869 --> 01:30:20.480
- Right.

1952
01:30:20.523 --> 01:30:20.958
Because you can always just
add some zeros infinitely.


1953
01:30:21.002 --> 01:30:22.134
- Right.

1954
01:30:22.177 --> 01:30:23.787
Infinitely.

1955
01:30:23.831 --> 01:30:24.658
Right so I'm just glad God
did what he did for me.


1956
01:30:24.701 --> 01:30:25.876
- Like divinity.

1957
01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.574
- That was a super big
blessing man, for real.


1958
01:30:27.617 --> 01:30:30.838
- Man, everything seems
to be turning around man.


1959
01:30:30.881 --> 01:30:32.144
- Right.

1960
01:30:32.187 --> 01:30:35.016
- You put God first,
and put trust up in him,


1961
01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:38.715
it seems like no,
I know for a fact.


1962
01:30:38.759 --> 01:30:39.673
I can testify.

1963
01:30:41.849 --> 01:30:43.894
You have blessings in your life.

1964
01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:45.200
- Absolutely.

1965
01:30:45.244 --> 01:30:46.419
- You have trials and
tribulations, yes,


1966
01:30:46.462 --> 01:30:47.768
but you have blessings
in your life.


1967
01:30:47.811 --> 01:30:49.117
- Right.

1968
01:30:49.161 --> 01:30:51.337
- You know my book's
about to get published.


1969
01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:52.555
You just got promoted.

1970
01:30:52.599 --> 01:30:53.904
- Oh yeah, they did that?

1971
01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:54.949
That dude at your work?

1972
01:30:54.992 --> 01:30:56.124
- Man!

1973
01:30:56.168 --> 01:30:57.821
- Congratulations man!

1974
01:30:57.865 --> 01:30:58.996
- You know what's what I'm
saying, get the inspiration


1975
01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.694
go ahead and finish
that that project!


1976
01:31:05.568 --> 01:31:08.005
The concert we're
practicing for.


1977
01:31:08.049 --> 01:31:09.355
- Right, right, right.

1978
01:31:09.398 --> 01:31:12.706
- And then, I think we
need to go celebrate.


1979
01:31:12.749 --> 01:31:14.403
Hey, matter of fact.

1980
01:31:14.447 --> 01:31:16.971
My boss said he was gonna
take us four-wheeling man,


1981
01:31:17.014 --> 01:31:19.060
he said hey we gonna take
a four-wheeling trip,


1982
01:31:19.104 --> 01:31:20.235
do you wanna go?

1983
01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.542
- Are you asking me to go?

1984
01:31:22.585 --> 01:31:23.891
- Yeah, I'm asking you to go.

1985
01:31:23.934 --> 01:31:24.587
- Yeah, I'll go!

1986
01:31:24.631 --> 01:31:25.762
- Yeah!

1987
01:31:25.806 --> 01:31:26.807
There's nothing wrong
for that mountain!


1988
01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:28.765
- For sure, yeah absolutely.

1989
01:31:28.809 --> 01:31:29.897
That sounds fun.

1990
01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:31.116
You know I need to
celebrate anyway.


1991
01:31:31.159 --> 01:31:32.595
God's just been
blessing me lately.


1992
01:31:32.639 --> 01:31:34.031
And well, he been
blessing my whole life,


1993
01:31:34.075 --> 01:31:36.512
but really lately he been
coming through for me man.


1994
01:31:36.556 --> 01:31:39.472
- Yeah, you was in a dark place.

1995
01:31:39.515 --> 01:31:42.170
That I ain't know,
we both for it man.


1996
01:31:42.214 --> 01:31:45.913
You know, just, you
come to a crossroads


1997
01:31:45.956 --> 01:31:49.830
and if you lean towards God,
you gonna make the right path.


1998
01:31:49.873 --> 01:31:51.571
- Right.

1999
01:31:51.614 --> 01:31:54.922
- And I mean, I'm just glad
I got you as a brother man.


2000
01:31:54.965 --> 01:31:56.663
Somebody go through that with.

2001
01:31:56.706 --> 01:31:58.230
- Absolutely man, me too.

2002
01:31:58.273 --> 01:31:59.883
Me too.

2003
01:31:59.927 --> 01:32:01.102
Make sure you stay in your
place, little brother.


2004
01:32:01.146 --> 01:32:02.147
[laughs]

2005
01:32:02.190 --> 01:32:03.800
- That's what God got.

2006
01:32:03.844 --> 01:32:06.020
- You know we ain't
nothing without God man.


2007
01:32:06.063 --> 01:32:08.631
That's the realest thing
ever man, I love that.


2008
01:32:13.027 --> 01:32:14.724
- You gonna accept.

2009
01:32:15.943 --> 01:32:19.251
Your inself is your energy.

2010
01:32:20.730 --> 01:32:23.255
Like I put on every
post about Nispey.


2011
01:32:23.298 --> 01:32:24.169
Energy never dies.

2012
01:32:25.779 --> 01:32:28.260
Your energy is here.

2013
01:32:28.303 --> 01:32:29.957
You know what I'm saying,

2014
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:33.830
and then the thing, Nispey
modeled himself after Pot.


2015
01:32:37.269 --> 01:32:38.618
He said thug life.

2016
01:32:40.141 --> 01:32:41.577
He screamed pot.

2017
01:32:42.796 --> 01:32:44.450
All that.

2018
01:32:44.493 --> 01:32:46.495
And look what he did.

2019
01:32:46.539 --> 01:32:47.714
He's just not common.

2020
01:32:59.856 --> 01:33:02.119
[sneezes]

2021
01:33:02.163 --> 01:33:03.686
- [Marvin] Bless you.

2022
01:33:10.389 --> 01:33:11.172
- Oh!

2023
01:33:15.568 --> 01:33:18.875
Get something for everybody,
get some chicken man.


2024
01:33:20.312 --> 01:33:21.095
- Hey, home boy need that.

2025
01:33:30.496 --> 01:33:32.715
- What up with y'all?

2026
01:33:32.759 --> 01:33:34.108
- What's up bro?

2027
01:33:34.151 --> 01:33:34.804
- Bro.

2028
01:33:35.805 --> 01:33:37.633
Man.

2029
01:33:37.677 --> 01:33:39.113
Your dope man, it's
the rest of what I had,


2030
01:33:39.156 --> 01:33:41.158
I already played it with TI man.

2031
01:33:41.202 --> 01:33:43.900
I appreciate you,
God bless you man.


2032
01:33:43.944 --> 01:33:45.424
God came through for me what.

2033
01:33:46.903 --> 01:33:49.428
- You know there's no refunds
on this type of thing.


2034
01:33:49.471 --> 01:33:51.256
- What you say?

2035
01:33:51.299 --> 01:33:52.648
- You know there ain't
no refunds on this man.


2036
01:33:52.692 --> 01:33:54.389
- Man, I do understand.

2037
01:33:55.695 --> 01:33:59.176
I talked to TI and
we worked it out.


2038
01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:00.787
- You know, know I love y'all.

2039
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:02.267
I'm a accept it this time.

2040
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:03.920
- Man I appreciate it man.

2041
01:34:03.964 --> 01:34:04.878
I'm trying not to never
have to come back to that.


2042
01:34:04.921 --> 01:34:06.793
For real.

2043
01:34:06.836 --> 01:34:08.708
But if I need you,
I'm a call you.


2044
01:34:08.751 --> 01:34:09.839
For real.

2045
01:34:09.883 --> 01:34:11.363
- That's what's up,
that's what's up.


2046
01:34:11.406 --> 01:34:12.538
- Y'all handle that?

2047
01:34:12.581 --> 01:34:13.452
- Yeah, we did
handle that business.


2048
01:34:13.495 --> 01:34:14.583
Come through.

2049
01:34:14.627 --> 01:34:18.674
- Yeah, much love, much love.

2050
01:34:20.937 --> 01:34:23.244
- Well we gonna head out
now bro, we gonna shake.


2051
01:34:23.288 --> 01:34:25.768
I just wanted to you
know, come drop that off.


2052
01:34:25.812 --> 01:34:28.467
And get your bread
that I made off of it.


2053
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:31.992
Man, I got a job man!

2054
01:34:32.035 --> 01:34:33.428
- That's what's up man.

2055
01:34:33.472 --> 01:34:35.256
- I got a job, I appreciate
that urine sample.


2056
01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:38.738
- Yeah, yeah, everything
you need, just call me man.


2057
01:34:38.781 --> 01:34:39.956
- Okay.

2058
01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:41.871
- You know I always got you.

2059
01:34:41.915 --> 01:34:43.786
- BT, all right bro.

2060
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:46.267
Hey man, what's this
book you reading?


2061
01:34:46.311 --> 01:34:48.182
Is this Being on Living?

2062
01:34:49.052 --> 01:34:51.664
Oh man, where I get this from.

2063
01:34:51.707 --> 01:34:52.752
- You can have it.

2064
01:34:52.795 --> 01:34:54.362
- Man, I appreciate that man.

2065
01:34:54.406 --> 01:34:55.320

- Oh my God.

2122
01:38:08.687 --> 01:38:09.644
- She's not responsive.

2123
01:38:09.688 --> 01:38:11.124
- Is she bleeding?

2124
01:38:11.167 --> 01:38:12.647
- No, I don't see any blood.

2125
01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:16.129
- Okay, what about 911?

2126
01:38:16.172 --> 01:38:18.435

I been drinking.


2127
01:38:18.479 --> 01:38:19.524
- [Keenan] You been drinking?

01:38:19.567 --> 01:38:20.437
- [Marvin] Man.

2129
01:38:20.481 --> 01:38:21.743
- [Keenan] I only had one beer!

2130
01:38:21.787 --> 01:38:22.918
- I don't want to
go back to jail.


2131
01:38:22.962 --> 01:38:24.790
- I don't know what to do.

2132
01:38:24.833 --> 01:38:26.226

- They say, come as you are.

2135
01:38:29.795 --> 01:38:31.492
We've been drinking.

2136
01:38:31.536 --> 01:38:33.059
We need your healing power.

2137
01:38:33.102 --> 01:38:34.190
- Oh my God.

2138
01:38:34.234 --> 01:38:36.889
You think she's gonna die?

2139
01:38:36.932 --> 01:38:38.760
- Hold on man,
let's pray for her.


2140
01:38:38.804 --> 01:38:40.632
- You think that's gonna work?

2141
01:38:40.675 --> 01:38:42.155
- There's no other option.

2142
01:38:42.198 --> 01:38:44.200
I don't know what else to do.

2143
01:38:44.244 --> 01:38:45.201
I know God is real.

2144
01:38:45.245 --> 01:38:47.160
God I know you're real.

2145
01:38:47.203 --> 01:38:49.118
I don't know how your
healing power works


2146
01:38:49.162 --> 01:38:52.687
we been drinking,
can I come as we are?


2147
01:38:52.731 --> 01:38:54.036
I don't know what to do.

2148
01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:55.647
What is the process?

2149
01:38:55.690 --> 01:38:56.822
If I'm supposed
to be a holy man?


2150
01:38:56.865 --> 01:38:58.084
- We need a miracle.

2151
01:38:58.127 --> 01:38:59.955
- We need a miracle,
God please just.


2152
01:38:59.999 --> 01:39:02.958
God let me just
lay hands on her.


2153
01:39:03.002 --> 01:39:03.916
God please.

2154
01:39:05.091 --> 01:39:07.789
I know you have
healing in your power.


2155
01:39:07.833 --> 01:39:09.095
I don't know if we're
supposed to speak it


2156
01:39:09.138 --> 01:39:10.879
into existence or
ask you to heal her.


2157
01:39:10.923 --> 01:39:12.794
But God let her be
healed, in Jesus' name.


2158
01:39:14.317 --> 01:39:15.928
- Lord, please bless her.

2159
01:39:15.971 --> 01:39:17.669
I know that you can
heal all wounds.


2160
01:39:17.712 --> 01:39:20.280
I know that you the author
and creator of our faith.


2161
01:39:20.323 --> 01:39:22.630
And you get to decide
who comes and who goes.


2162
01:39:22.674 --> 01:39:23.979
But lord don't let
it be her time.


2163
01:39:24.023 --> 01:39:25.720
Do not let it be her time, lord.

2164
01:39:25.764 --> 01:39:27.766
We got too much living to do.

2165
01:39:27.809 --> 01:39:28.680
Amen.

2166
01:39:28.723 --> 01:39:29.985
- She's starting to move.

2167
01:39:32.118 --> 01:39:33.032
She's waking up.

2168
01:39:33.075 --> 01:39:33.946
- Are you all right?

2169
01:39:33.989 --> 01:39:34.903
- Are you okay?

2170
01:39:34.947 --> 01:39:35.948
- [CJ] What's going on?

2171
01:39:35.991 --> 01:39:36.818
- Can you feel this?

2172
01:39:36.862 --> 01:39:37.776
- Hold on, slow down.

2173
01:39:37.819 --> 01:39:39.691
- [Boss] Don't move.

2174
01:39:39.734 --> 01:39:40.909
- [Marvin] You sure you're okay?

2175
01:39:40.953 --> 01:39:41.736
- You all right?

2176
01:39:41.780 --> 01:39:42.868
- Yeah, I'm fine.

2177
01:39:42.911 --> 01:39:43.782
What's going on?

2178
01:39:43.825 --> 01:39:45.435
It's fine, everything's cool.

2179
01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:46.219
- You sure?

2180
01:39:46.262 --> 01:39:46.915
- Yes.

2181
01:39:49.701 --> 01:39:50.876
Yeah, I'm good.

2182
01:39:50.919 --> 01:39:52.007
- Thank you lord.

2183
01:39:53.008 --> 01:39:54.314
You sure you're all right man?

2184
01:39:54.357 --> 01:39:55.794

2186
01:39:56.925 --> 01:39:57.796
- That was crazy.

2187
01:39:57.839 --> 01:40:00.102
She's back in the cabin.

2188
01:40:00.146 --> 01:40:02.714

01:40:35.094 --> 01:40:37.357
- It's crazy though, it's crazy.

2205
01:40:38.619 --> 01:40:40.795
- Did you see when
she flipped off?


2206
01:40:40.839 --> 01:40:42.057
- Right, she flew through
the air like Superman.


2207
01:40:42.101 --> 01:40:44.669
[laughs]

2208
01:40:44.712 --> 01:40:45.887
For real.

God do answer

01:41:04.471 --> 01:41:05.951

2217
01:41:05.994 --> 01:41:06.865

2225
01:41:49.821 --> 01:41:51.039
- I'm slipping!

2226
01:41:51.083 --> 01:41:51.910
- [Keenan] I'm
coming, I'm coming!


2227
01:41:51.953 --> 01:41:53.476
I see you, I see you!

2228
01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:57.219
Come on!

2229
01:41:57.263 --> 01:41:58.873
Come on.

2230
01:41:58.917 --> 01:41:59.744
Come on!

2231
01:42:02.311 --> 01:42:03.312
Come on bro!

2232
01:42:04.705 --> 01:42:05.488
I got you!

2233
01:42:13.148 --> 01:42:14.759
- [Boss] Man what
happened to y'all?


2234
01:42:15.934 --> 01:42:18.197
Hey that's Dead Man's curve.

2235
01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:21.113
- Man, nobody ever makes
it out of there alive man.


2236
01:42:21.156 --> 01:42:22.418
- Man, y'all lucky.

2237
01:42:22.462 --> 01:42:24.377
- Man God was with
us that wasn't luck.


2238
01:42:25.639 --> 01:42:26.727
- You all right?

2239
01:42:27.728 --> 01:42:29.251
- You got some water?

2240
01:42:29.295 --> 01:42:30.035
- [Boss] Got water.

2241
01:42:39.087 --> 01:42:39.827
- Man.

2242
01:42:41.307 --> 01:42:42.264
Thought I just died.

2243
01:42:43.396 --> 01:42:44.179
- You did.

2244
01:42:46.703 --> 01:42:47.704
- You all right man?

2245
01:42:49.445 --> 01:42:51.621
It's a long way down Marvin.

2246
01:42:53.841 --> 01:42:56.888
- Come on man, let's
get up out of here.


2247
01:42:56.931 --> 01:42:57.627
I need a tow.

2248
01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:09.901
- That's when I
stopped and put her.


2249
01:43:09.944 --> 01:43:10.858
And you all right?

2250
01:43:10.902 --> 01:43:13.034
Four-wheeler, four-wheeler.

2251
01:43:13.078 --> 01:43:15.167
Screw the four-wheeler man.

2252
01:43:15.210 --> 01:43:15.820
You all right?

2253
01:43:16.908 --> 01:43:17.996
I think so.

2254
01:43:18.039 --> 01:43:19.693
[laughs]

2255
01:43:19.736 --> 01:43:20.999
I think so.

2256
01:43:21.042 --> 01:43:22.827
Yeah, you all right.

2257
01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:24.089
- Man.

2258
01:43:24.132 --> 01:43:25.264
I didn't really
realize I wrecked


2259
01:43:25.307 --> 01:43:26.874
at Dead Man's curve though,

2260
01:43:26.918 --> 01:43:28.571
so all I could think about
was the four-wheeler.


2261
01:43:28.615 --> 01:43:30.008
I wrecked your stuff.

2262
01:43:30.051 --> 01:43:34.055
I knew I was okay, so I
was concerned about that.


2263
01:43:34.099 --> 01:43:36.666
- You know then I heard
him I was like aw man.


2264
01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:37.972
I didn't hear it.

2265
01:43:38.016 --> 01:43:39.974
I didn't hear the four-wheeler
or nothing no more.


2266
01:43:40.018 --> 01:43:42.934
So I jumped off and went
down this little ravine


2267
01:43:42.977 --> 01:43:44.805
where I saw the brush
had been broken.


2268
01:43:44.849 --> 01:43:46.851
And I saw him
hanging down there.


2269
01:43:46.894 --> 01:43:48.765
And there wasn't nothing
underneath of him.


2270
01:43:48.809 --> 01:43:51.464
It was like, just like a drop
off the side of a mountain.


2271
01:43:51.507 --> 01:43:52.900
And when I walked down there.

2272
01:43:52.944 --> 01:43:56.121
I slid, I almost fell
in that, just me.


2273
01:43:56.164 --> 01:43:59.864
So you know I grabbed him
and tried to pull him up.


2274
01:43:59.907 --> 01:44:01.778
But you know, he kinda heavy.

2275
01:44:01.822 --> 01:44:03.868
So, you know but we got
up out of there man.


2276
01:44:03.911 --> 01:44:05.173
It was crazy

2277
01:44:05.217 --> 01:44:07.784
[hip hop beat]

2278
01:44:22.625 --> 01:44:24.279
- You want my cupcake?

2279
01:44:24.323 --> 01:44:25.672
[laughs]

2280
01:44:25.715 --> 01:44:28.414
There's some food
at the house bro.
