2
00:03:52.381 --> 00:03:54.175
We're not set up to break you.

3
00:03:54.258 --> 00:03:55.801
We're here to rehabilitate.

4
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.097
But ultimately,
it's up to you how it plays out.


5
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.101
You've had plenty of time in solitary

6
00:04:04.185 --> 00:04:06.229
to think about how
we want you to behave.

7
00:04:07.522 --> 00:04:10.441
But again, I can only strongly
suggest that in the end,


8
00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:11.609
it all lies with you.

9
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.620
<i>You have certain choices.
Others have to be made for you.</i>


10
00:04:24.372 --> 00:04:27.542
<i>This one, for instance. 
A new cellmate.</i>

11
00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:28.709
<i>You can't live a solitary life</i>

12
00:04:28.793 --> 00:04:30.628
<i>in the way that you necessarily want.</i>

13
00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:34.924
<i>You have to acknowledge that
you have a debt to pay society</i>


14
00:04:35.007 --> 00:04:37.218
<i>and it will be paid in
the manner we choose.</i>


15
00:04:38.302 --> 00:04:39.262
<i>Good behaviour.</i>

16
00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:45.643
You've given your counsellor your word.

17
00:04:46.978 --> 00:04:47.937
Keep it.

18
00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:51.399
Last chance.

19
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.214
Be nice.

20
00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:03.763
Bottom shelf, Wainwright, yeah?

21
00:06:05.097 --> 00:06:06.265
Get it sorted.

22
00:06:52.269 --> 00:06:53.604
<i>She's ready.</i>

23
00:06:54.146 --> 00:06:54.980
<i>Committed.</i>

24
00:06:56.107 --> 00:06:59.568
There are a few rudimentary
but necessary amendments


25
00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:04.115
to the paperwork, but once
they're cleared, it's up to you.


26
00:07:05.157 --> 00:07:06.700
Your decision is the final one.

27
00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:11.622
I want you to understand that, Steve.

28
00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:14.583
This will not happen unless you clear it.

29
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.379
If you're not ready,
if you're not comfortable,


30
00:07:18.462 --> 00:07:22.508
we can postpone indefinitely, if need be.

31
00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:26.971
Twenty years is a long time.

32
00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:29.432
She's a woman now.

33
00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:35.146
From what we know, she claims
she doesn't expect anything from you.


34
00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:37.231
It's just about her closure.

35
00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:39.275
Her forgiveness, perhaps.

36
00:07:40.776 --> 00:07:43.362
But she may be looking for something more
than she's confiding in us.


37
00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:48.242
She may be angry. 
She may want answers.

38
00:07:50.161 --> 00:07:51.662
I need you to have an
inkling of how you feel


39
00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:53.998
before you subject
yourself to the situation.


40
00:07:56.417 --> 00:07:57.960
How you want it to pan out.

41
00:07:59.462 --> 00:08:02.131
But you should know there is a possibility

42
00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:04.258
that Karen's mother could be there.

43
00:08:10.181 --> 00:08:11.056
Steve?

44
00:08:27.281 --> 00:08:28.824
We know you're a fucking grass!

45
00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:31.202
You're a fucking dead man!

46
00:08:31.285 --> 00:08:32.495
You're fucked!

47
00:08:32.578 --> 00:08:33.829
Boys!

48
00:08:33.913 --> 00:08:35.623
- You're fucked!
- Boys!


49
00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.313
Thanks for the tea.

50
00:10:29.612 --> 00:10:30.654
The showers that way?

51
00:11:08.025 --> 00:11:10.110
Scotty Turnbull's in the southeast!

52
00:11:15.991 --> 00:11:18.243
Psst! Come here.

53
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:24.041
Marcus Wainwright?

54
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.003
- Yeah.
- I know your cousin, Ifbra.


55
00:11:28.087 --> 00:11:29.922
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Good geezer.


56
00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.425
You stand like a hard-man, don't ya?

57
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:36.095
All puffy chest. 
You a hard-man, son?

58
00:11:36.178 --> 00:11:38.013
- I ain't after...
- After what?


59
00:11:38.806 --> 00:11:39.723
Eh?

60
00:11:39.807 --> 00:11:41.558
You can hold of yourself, can ya?

61
00:11:42.184 --> 00:11:44.436
This ain't no fuckin'
street fight no more, kid.


62
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.230
You're on the fuckin' wing now.

63
00:11:47.022 --> 00:11:49.900
Your cousin can, hold himself.

64
00:11:50.651 --> 00:11:51.860
I'm good.

65
00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.028
What?

66
00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:55.447
- I'm good, man.
- You're good?


67
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.200
You puttin' on me?

68
00:11:59.284 --> 00:12:00.661
You offerin' a poof cunt?

69
00:12:03.706 --> 00:12:06.125
- You're fuckin' dead now.
- Don't you fucking move.


70
00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:07.626
All right, all right!
Let it lie, let it lie.


71
00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:08.752
Sorry, Steve. Sorry, okay?

72
00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:11.505
It's me and him, man.
His cousin's a grass.


73
00:12:11.588 --> 00:12:12.881
That's all I got. That's it.

74
00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:15.551
Don't you ever fuckin' bring it here,
you understand me?


75
00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.261
Do you fucking understand me?

76
00:12:17.344 --> 00:12:18.178
Yes.

77
00:12:19.054 --> 00:12:19.930
Now fuck off.

78
00:12:21.181 --> 00:12:22.015
Yeah.

79
00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:28.021
That was all him. All him.

80
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.334
- We all good?
- Yeah.


81
00:12:54.548 --> 00:12:55.758
So, how is he?

82
00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:57.843
He's green.

83
00:12:58.969 --> 00:13:02.181
Tell him to get it down on
the early. Might be beneficial.


84
00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:15.444
He probably wants the wing, Scotty.

85
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.263
Have a tool handy.

86
00:13:43.347 --> 00:13:44.640
Don't do the walkabout with it,

87
00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:47.518
because you'll get a random
and then you're in the hole.


88
00:13:48.393 --> 00:13:49.853
Have one stashed.

89
00:13:49.937 --> 00:13:52.439
If someone makes a move,
you'll get a mark or two.


90
00:13:52.523 --> 00:13:54.358
Just keep them away from the vitals.

91
00:13:56.568 --> 00:13:57.444
If you're tooled up,

92
00:13:57.528 --> 00:14:00.030
at least one of you
is going to the burner.


93
00:14:00.113 --> 00:14:01.573
But chances are you'll take a sting

94
00:14:01.657 --> 00:14:02.950
and you'll get out of it.

95
00:14:03.033 --> 00:14:05.994
Let it settle, then have your go.

96
00:14:07.287 --> 00:14:09.748
Chances are slim that
you'll keep out the lineup.


97
00:14:10.707 --> 00:14:12.960
So use it, knowing that
you'll have to be okay


98
00:14:13.043 --> 00:14:14.586
with your own company for a bit.

99
00:14:15.546 --> 00:14:17.506
But the mug you
want will be off guard.

100
00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:20.884
That's the time to take him.

101
00:14:31.645 --> 00:14:33.272
Up!

102
00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:34.940
Fuck. What time is it?

103
00:14:35.023 --> 00:14:36.942
6:30. Get up!

104
00:14:38.235 --> 00:14:39.278
Breakfast at seven?

105
00:14:39.361 --> 00:14:41.572
You sleep deep for a new boot. Up!

106
00:14:47.578 --> 00:14:48.787
What's the breakfast like here?

107
00:14:49.746 --> 00:14:51.248
How long'd they give ya?

108
00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:54.793
Seven.

109
00:14:54.877 --> 00:14:56.378
You'll be sick of it in two.

110
00:14:58.172 --> 00:14:59.506
What, was you armed, yeah?

111
00:15:01.091 --> 00:15:01.925
Yeah.

112
00:15:02.926 --> 00:15:04.303
They threw assault at me.

113
00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:06.597
Was it worth it?

114
00:15:07.931 --> 00:15:09.349
Is it ever?

115
00:15:09.433 --> 00:15:10.809
It is, if it's an earner.

116
00:15:15.522 --> 00:15:16.815
Ten large.

117
00:15:16.899 --> 00:15:18.317
Well, there's your answer.

118
00:15:23.405 --> 00:15:24.823
Bird's a cunt, right?

119
00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:31.705
Everyone around here. 
Everyone in here.

120
00:15:31.788 --> 00:15:35.751
And everyone who runs,
controls, and visits. All cunts, yeah.


121
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.502
You just gotta decide early on

122
00:15:37.586 --> 00:15:39.171
what type of cunt you wanna be.

123
00:15:42.382 --> 00:15:43.508
I ain't a funny cunt.

124
00:15:53.352 --> 00:15:54.937
<i>There are two types of inmates.</i>

125
00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:57.397
<i>Someone that the courts are mad at,</i>

126
00:15:57.481 --> 00:15:58.941
<i>so they throw him a sentence.</i>

127
00:15:59.024 --> 00:16:01.318
<i>To me, well, they're
half the fuckin' problem.</i>


128
00:16:02.277 --> 00:16:05.822
<i>Should've been given cleanup
duty on the M25 for six months.</i>


129
00:16:05.906 --> 00:16:07.491
<i>Stop anyone from acting up.</i>

130
00:16:08.909 --> 00:16:11.161
<i>Instead, it costs them 100 grand up,</i>

131
00:16:11.245 --> 00:16:13.038
<i>just to keep them in a ten-by-eight.</i>

132
00:16:14.998 --> 00:16:17.918
<i>The other is someone who
is a danger to society.</i>


133
00:16:18.001 --> 00:16:20.087
<i>Those are the ones
who deserve to be here.</i>

134
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.130
<i>Locked in, locked up.</i>

135
00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:26.718
<i>I deserve to be here and by
the sounds of it, so do you.</i>


136
00:16:27.844 --> 00:16:28.679
<i>Know that.</i>

137
00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:31.807
<i>You know that and you're halfway done.</i>

138
00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:36.895
<i>Suss it out. 
Get a feel for the place.</i>

139
00:16:36.979 --> 00:16:38.689
<i>There's plenty to keep your mind right.</i>

140
00:16:38.772 --> 00:16:40.607
<i>Plenty of places to find the poison.</i>

141
00:16:45.946 --> 00:16:49.157
<i>But if you wanna do it right,
once you're legit, ask away.</i>


142
00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:52.369
<i>You don't have to be
a cunt in this cell.</i>

143
00:16:53.704 --> 00:16:56.164
<i>Use common sense if you
need to take a smash.</i>


144
00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:57.374
<i>Always check it first.</i>

145
00:16:57.457 --> 00:16:59.918
<i>Make sure there's nothing being stored.</i>

146
00:17:00.002 --> 00:17:03.213
<i>Shit when I'm not here
and I'll do the same.</i>


147
00:17:03.297 --> 00:17:04.172
<i>We're not animals.</i>

148
00:17:05.132 --> 00:17:07.259
<i>Look out for me and
I'll look out for you.</i>

149
00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:41.960
Deserve it?

150
00:17:46.715 --> 00:17:48.050
I won't bring it in here.

151
00:17:55.223 --> 00:17:56.058
What?

152
00:18:04.024 --> 00:18:05.359
I need to shit.

153
00:18:05.901 --> 00:18:07.486
Wait till the morning.

154
00:18:08.528 --> 00:18:10.113
I don't know if I can though, man.

155
00:18:11.406 --> 00:18:12.783
You will.

156
00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:14.743
Lights out!

157
00:19:13.468 --> 00:19:14.803
The fuck are you doing?

158
00:19:14.886 --> 00:19:18.557
What the fuck are you doing?

159
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.308
- Please!
- Dirty cunt!


160
00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:21.935
Are you a fucking animal?

161
00:19:22.018 --> 00:19:23.478
Eh?

162
00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:26.481
You fucking listen to me!
You listen to me!


163
00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:28.066
Get your fuckin' head down there.

164
00:19:32.946 --> 00:19:35.115
What're you doin', man?
What're you doin'?


165
00:19:35.198 --> 00:19:36.825
Filthy little cunt!

166
00:19:36.908 --> 00:19:39.202
You dirty, rodent cunt!

167
00:19:39.286 --> 00:19:40.912
Fucking dirty...

168
00:19:53.717 --> 00:19:56.428
<i>I see you hesitate, 
I'll take you down.</i>

169
00:20:06.521 --> 00:20:08.982
<i>I knew it was a strong hit
by the colour of his blood.</i>


170
00:20:18.742 --> 00:20:21.203
<i>You come at me with your aggression,</i>

171
00:20:21.286 --> 00:20:23.538
<i>you come at me with your bottle,</i>

172
00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:26.583
<i>you have to fuck me off,
otherwise I'm gonna come on,</i>


173
00:20:26.666 --> 00:20:27.792
<i>and I'm gonna end you.</i>

174
00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:32.172
<i>I will stab the shit out of
you until you stop moving.</i>


175
00:20:35.342 --> 00:20:38.678
<i>Incarcerate a toe-rag
and turn him into a dangerous man.</i>


176
00:20:40.055 --> 00:20:44.476
<i>Incarcerate a dangerous man?
Well, this is your doing.</i>


177
00:21:26.601 --> 00:21:27.435
Here.

178
00:21:32.482 --> 00:21:34.568
Hands behind your back, Mackelson.

179
00:21:34.651 --> 00:21:36.194
Where is it, Steve?

180
00:21:36.278 --> 00:21:37.320
Did you flush it?

181
00:21:38.488 --> 00:21:39.489
The cunt flushed it.

182
00:21:41.825 --> 00:21:44.119
Got an inmate with half
a fuckin' nose out there!


183
00:21:44.995 --> 00:21:46.871
I couldn't care less how he
feels about that, but I will


184
00:21:46.955 --> 00:21:49.249
lock you up for the fuckin'
peace, do you hear me?


185
00:21:49.708 --> 00:21:50.542
Where is it?

186
00:21:51.668 --> 00:21:52.794
I ain't got nothing.

187
00:21:54.838 --> 00:21:55.964
Okay.

188
00:21:56.047 --> 00:21:57.299
Okay, chuck him in.

189
00:22:01.845 --> 00:22:02.804
You see who did it?

190
00:22:03.263 --> 00:22:04.222
No.

191
00:22:04.598 --> 00:22:06.808
You were standing right there.

192
00:22:09.686 --> 00:22:10.937
You've started early, haven't you?

193
00:22:11.021 --> 00:22:13.815
Fuckin' shit breeds quickly in here, eh?

194
00:22:13.898 --> 00:22:16.484
I know one of
you two chomped his nose.

195
00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:18.153
I didn't do anything, sir.

196
00:22:18.236 --> 00:22:21.489
Well, one of you did.
If you didn't, did he?


197
00:22:22.991 --> 00:22:24.534
Nah, he was with me.
I just heard it kick off.


198
00:22:24.618 --> 00:22:27.704
Don't even fuckin' bother, okay?

199
00:22:31.624 --> 00:22:34.669
Your friend here,
he's done a lot of his bird in solitary


200
00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:36.212
so we know he can take it.

201
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.715
But can you, hm?

202
00:22:40.133 --> 00:22:42.427
'Cause if I don't get an
answer from either one of yous,


203
00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:44.054
you're the one taking the fall.

204
00:22:45.472 --> 00:22:48.516
You've got ten seconds to tell us,

205
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.060
or get yourself ready for an hour's recce,

206
00:22:50.143 --> 00:22:51.644
a day, for the next three months.

207
00:22:51.728 --> 00:22:52.562
One.

208
00:22:53.521 --> 00:22:54.356
Two.

209
00:22:55.398 --> 00:22:56.232
Three.

210
00:22:57.650 --> 00:22:58.485
Four.

211
00:23:00.111 --> 00:23:01.029
Five.

212
00:23:02.405 --> 00:23:03.573
Six.

213
00:23:03.656 --> 00:23:05.325
Oh, you know what?
Fuck it, get him out of here.


214
00:23:08.078 --> 00:23:09.871
You're really gonna let him take that?

215
00:23:16.878 --> 00:23:18.129
What a fuckin' man.

216
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.309
Closing 1887!

217
00:23:32.477 --> 00:23:33.937
<i>Of course, it's concerning.</i>

218
00:23:35.105 --> 00:23:39.609
Is this something you don't want, Steve?

219
00:23:40.276 --> 00:23:41.778
'Cause if that's the case,

220
00:23:43.571 --> 00:23:48.118
if there are any more incidents,
allegations,


221
00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.453
any reports...

222
00:23:51.162 --> 00:23:53.206
<i>Yeah? They'll do what?</i>

223
00:23:54.082 --> 00:23:56.084
- Then we call it quits.
- <i>This is a way of life.</i>


224
00:23:56.167 --> 00:23:59.254
<i>I chose it. 
I live it and I accept it.</i>

225
00:24:00.296 --> 00:24:02.340
<i>Allegations are just that. Alleged.</i>

226
00:24:02.424 --> 00:24:03.341
You won't sit opposite...

227
00:24:03.425 --> 00:24:05.468
<i>And you'll never hear me admit it.</i>

228
00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:08.138
<i>I took Scotty's nose off, yeah.</i>

229
00:24:08.221 --> 00:24:09.556
Is that understood?

230
00:24:09.639 --> 00:24:11.141
<i>And I'll take his fucking
throat out next time,</i>


231
00:24:11.224 --> 00:24:12.392
<i>if he don't drop it.</i>

232
00:24:14.727 --> 00:24:16.271
The courts will take
this into consideration


233
00:24:16.354 --> 00:24:17.605
<i>when they are reviewing your...</i>

234
00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:19.023
<i>Consideration.</i>

235
00:24:20.316 --> 00:24:22.277
<i>They wanna stop her from seeing me.</i>

236
00:24:22.652 --> 00:24:23.862
<i>Well, let 'em.</i>

237
00:24:23.945 --> 00:24:26.614
<i>I'm here and this is it.
I don't get a parole hearing.</i>


238
00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:28.241
- Are we clear?
- <i>I don't get a release date.</i>


239
00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:30.076
<i>I'll die in here.</i>

240
00:24:31.327 --> 00:24:33.663
- No more incidents.
- <i>I'm up against it.</i>


241
00:24:33.746 --> 00:24:35.331
<i>A bird cage story.</i>

242
00:24:35.915 --> 00:24:38.126
<i>So they can do whatever
they fucking please.</i>


243
00:24:39.544 --> 00:24:41.504
- Now...
- <i>Yeah, I done her.</i>


244
00:24:41.588 --> 00:24:43.882
<i>Took the life right out of her.</i>

245
00:24:43.965 --> 00:24:46.634
<i>An act so vile,
but I did it, just like that.</i>


246
00:24:48.803 --> 00:24:50.805
<i>It's amazing how easy it was.</i>

247
00:24:51.723 --> 00:24:53.808
No more incidents.

248
00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:57.770
<i>You think you know my crimes. 
You don't.</i>

249
00:24:58.563 --> 00:25:01.065
<i>You know I killed her
and that cunt she left me for,</i>


250
00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:03.943
<i>but you don't know how,
you don't wanna know how.</i>


251
00:25:04.027 --> 00:25:05.862
<i>You can't take it to know how.</i>

252
00:25:05.945 --> 00:25:07.447
See you then, Steve.

253
00:25:14.287 --> 00:25:16.372
<i>Don't tell me not to defend and survive</i>

254
00:25:16.456 --> 00:25:19.000
<i>in a place where my life
can end in an instant.</i>


255
00:25:20.919 --> 00:25:22.712
<i>Don't pretend to understand that.</i>

256
00:25:23.963 --> 00:25:28.259
<i>Because the truth is,
this is all their doing.</i>


257
00:25:29.385 --> 00:25:30.220
Yours.

258
00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:32.514
Mine.

259
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.225
Ours.

260
00:25:37.810 --> 00:25:39.687
You mix violence with violence,

261
00:25:41.189 --> 00:25:42.482
you watch for the outcome.

262
00:25:44.275 --> 00:25:45.735
I mean, what do you expect?

263
00:25:47.195 --> 00:25:51.616
You take away a man's civility
and he adjusts to it.


264
00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:55.245
Yeah, you keep him locked up.

265
00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.205
Good for you.

266
00:25:58.915 --> 00:26:01.376
You keep smiling at the
monsters that you create.


267
00:26:04.003 --> 00:26:06.923
'Cause eventually they're gonna
fucking chew you to the bone.


268
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.844
She wants to meet with me?

269
00:26:13.596 --> 00:26:14.430
Fine.

270
00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:17.433
She doesn't get to?

271
00:26:19.852 --> 00:26:21.062
No skin off my nose.

272
00:26:23.064 --> 00:26:26.109
<i>Wainwright's behaviour
needs constant monitoring.</i>


273
00:26:26.192 --> 00:26:28.444
<i>Seems he feels unheard, unsafe.</i>

274
00:26:29.529 --> 00:26:30.947
<i>His father has issued a complaint</i>

275
00:26:31.030 --> 00:26:33.116
<i>into the blackmail allegations
he's been receiving</i>


276
00:26:33.199 --> 00:26:35.451
<i>from Scott Turnbull's family members,</i>

277
00:26:35.535 --> 00:26:37.745
<i>seemingly offering their
coercion as protection</i>


278
00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:39.622
<i>from gang-affiliated inmates.</i>

279
00:26:41.332 --> 00:26:43.585
<i>Unfortunately, these things
do take time to investigate</i>


280
00:26:43.668 --> 00:26:46.588
<i>and that time only puts
his son in further danger.</i>


281
00:26:46.671 --> 00:26:49.215
<i>For now, keep him segregated.</i>

282
00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:51.301
<i>Let's make Mr. Mackelson
understand that we are</i>


283
00:26:51.384 --> 00:26:54.429
<i>the only ones who can offer
full protection on the inside,</i>


284
00:26:54.512 --> 00:26:57.098
<i>and that his indemnity's no longer needed.</i>

285
00:26:57.181 --> 00:26:59.350
<i>Our rules, our discipline.</i>

286
00:27:00.852 --> 00:27:02.020
<i>And make it stick.</i>

287
00:27:06.524 --> 00:27:08.151
We told you to fucking behave.

288
00:27:09.485 --> 00:27:10.778
Night night, sweetheart.

289
00:27:19.912 --> 00:27:21.664
<i>All cunts, the lot of them.</i>

290
00:27:21.748 --> 00:27:23.291
<i>All on the fucking take.</i>

291
00:27:24.792 --> 00:27:26.502
<i>I'll have every fucking one of ya.</i>

292
00:27:36.429 --> 00:27:37.513
It's wild in there.

293
00:27:38.681 --> 00:27:41.017
It'll make a man
out of you, but still...

294
00:27:47.357 --> 00:27:48.358
Thanks, Steve.

295
00:27:50.026 --> 00:27:51.986
I know why you let
'em put me in there.

296
00:28:05.249 --> 00:28:06.417
Is he out?

297
00:28:06.501 --> 00:28:07.835
No, transferred.

298
00:28:09.462 --> 00:28:10.963
But it won't be done with Scotty, though.

299
00:28:11.047 --> 00:28:12.131
Yeah, I know.

300
00:28:14.801 --> 00:28:15.927
They got to you.

301
00:28:18.137 --> 00:28:20.056
It was coming, with or without ya.

302
00:28:20.139 --> 00:28:21.516
It was a muscle move.

303
00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:22.975
I ain't holdin' onto it.

304
00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:27.605
Yeah.

305
00:28:28.898 --> 00:28:29.732
Thanks.

306
00:28:39.867 --> 00:28:41.911
She wants you to have these.

307
00:28:41.995 --> 00:28:44.247
Again, your choice to view them or not.

308
00:28:45.248 --> 00:28:47.041
Unfortunately, you can't keep 'em, but,

309
00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:48.459
feel free to rifle through.

310
00:28:49.794 --> 00:28:51.504
They're how she appears currently.

311
00:28:52.463 --> 00:28:54.507
And there are pictures of her child.

312
00:28:54.966 --> 00:28:56.050
Your grandchild.

313
00:28:58.803 --> 00:29:01.014
Different people, different reactions.

314
00:29:02.056 --> 00:29:04.142
You may not feel anything
when you look at her face,


315
00:29:04.225 --> 00:29:08.604
having not known her,
but sometimes they stir up


316
00:29:08.688 --> 00:29:11.065
emotions that are biological.

317
00:29:13.109 --> 00:29:14.152
How do you feel?

318
00:29:16.446 --> 00:29:17.864
How much does she know?

319
00:29:17.947 --> 00:29:19.157
Everything.

320
00:29:20.241 --> 00:29:22.785
I'm not entirely sure if every
detail has been discussed,


321
00:29:22.869 --> 00:29:25.163
but she knows the case and the sentencing.

322
00:29:25.246 --> 00:29:27.331
Do you think it's important
she knows the details?


323
00:29:27.790 --> 00:29:28.666
To who?

324
00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.085
Well, I'd like to know
if I was meeting a monster.


325
00:29:31.878 --> 00:29:33.463
Is that how you see yourself?

326
00:29:33.546 --> 00:29:34.964
Does that matter?

327
00:29:35.465 --> 00:29:37.175
That's how most perceive me.

328
00:29:40.136 --> 00:29:42.013
Twenty years ago, maybe.

329
00:29:42.096 --> 00:29:43.431
She knows what I did.

330
00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.018
Are you telling me she's
never been curious as to how?


331
00:29:47.393 --> 00:29:48.936
I'm not sure she would
want to know those details.


332
00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:50.021
Well, I would.

333
00:29:50.146 --> 00:29:51.314
Right, well, she's her own person.

334
00:29:51.397 --> 00:29:53.441
Yeah, but she's done her work,
she's done her research.


335
00:29:53.524 --> 00:29:54.650
Perhaps.

336
00:29:55.485 --> 00:29:57.320
Does that make you feel uneasy?

337
00:29:57.403 --> 00:29:58.321
Do you?

338
00:29:59.197 --> 00:30:00.156
Do I what?

339
00:30:00.239 --> 00:30:01.199
What I just said.

340
00:30:01.282 --> 00:30:03.034
Do you feel uneasy, knowing what I did?

341
00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:06.579
- Are you suggesting I should?
- No.


342
00:30:06.662 --> 00:30:08.539
I'm just saying, you know, being a woman.

343
00:30:09.165 --> 00:30:10.750
How do you feel, being around a man

344
00:30:10.833 --> 00:30:12.585
who committed such a horrendous crime?

345
00:30:17.173 --> 00:30:19.425
How about I keep my feelings to myself?

346
00:30:19.884 --> 00:30:21.469
They're not important
and we are off topic.


347
00:30:21.552 --> 00:30:22.720
No, we're not.

348
00:30:23.763 --> 00:30:25.515
'Cause we're talking
about a 20-year-old girl


349
00:30:25.598 --> 00:30:27.350
who wants to meet her father,

350
00:30:27.433 --> 00:30:30.353
who butchered her mother while
she slept in the same house.


351
00:30:31.604 --> 00:30:33.731
And you're a 30-year-old
woman who's now spending time


352
00:30:33.815 --> 00:30:36.776
with that man, one
on one, 20 years later.

353
00:30:39.737 --> 00:30:43.282
And I'm curious to know
the depths of your feelings,


354
00:30:43.366 --> 00:30:45.159
so that I can
navigate the depths of hers.

355
00:30:46.619 --> 00:30:47.954
Have you got any interest?

356
00:30:48.913 --> 00:30:49.872
No.

357
00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:55.795
These things usually bring
both parties closure, Steve.


358
00:30:57.255 --> 00:30:59.590
Being forgiven can release
you of many burdens.


359
00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.804
If you have any questions,
relay them to your SO,


360
00:31:04.887 --> 00:31:06.931
and I will do my best
to get them answered.


361
00:32:40.733 --> 00:32:42.401
Psst! Bounce brother.

362
00:32:52.119 --> 00:32:54.288
<i>There are certain things
you need to keep your bead on.</i>


363
00:32:56.082 --> 00:32:58.960
<i>On a calm day,
everyone has their comforts on.</i>


364
00:33:00.711 --> 00:33:03.047
<i>You start to see trainers laced up,
it's coming.</i>


365
00:33:04.465 --> 00:33:06.217
<i>Broken glass and broken bones hurt less</i>

366
00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.802
<i>when you've got your leather on.</i>

367
00:33:09.095 --> 00:33:12.848
<i>So, if you have to strap up,
know you're going toe-to-toe.</i>


368
00:33:13.599 --> 00:33:15.017
<i>Do what you have to.</i>

369
00:33:15.518 --> 00:33:16.978
<i>Survive how you can.</i>

370
00:33:18.688 --> 00:33:21.816
<i>Just know that anything that's
brought in here has risks.</i>


371
00:33:21.899 --> 00:33:24.318
<i>Someone will sniff it out
and wanna turn you over.</i>


372
00:33:26.821 --> 00:33:29.699
<i>This is our Wailing Wall,
our Geneva Convention.</i>


373
00:33:31.117 --> 00:33:33.828
<i>Throw down anywhere you like,
but leave this place be.</i>


374
00:33:35.955 --> 00:33:36.956
<i>Leave this place be.</i>

375
00:34:23.794 --> 00:34:25.880
Your safety is a concern of ours.

376
00:34:26.505 --> 00:34:29.925
As are the ongoing retaliations
that I'm sure are imminent.


377
00:34:33.554 --> 00:34:35.097
Can we rule out another attack?

378
00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:37.099
I ain't worried.

379
00:34:38.267 --> 00:34:39.101
I'm sure.

380
00:34:40.811 --> 00:34:42.313
Well, we can't take that risk.

381
00:34:44.231 --> 00:34:46.108
We're transferring you to segregation,

382
00:34:46.192 --> 00:34:47.902
until this whole thing calms down.

383
00:34:49.904 --> 00:34:50.946
What about the boy?

384
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:54.325
He'll adjust on his own.

385
00:34:55.451 --> 00:34:57.328
It's a life he has to experience.

386
00:34:58.579 --> 00:35:00.998
It isn't about his safety
and it isn't about yours, either.


387
00:35:01.082 --> 00:35:03.501
It's about theirs, Mr. Mackelson.

388
00:35:03.584 --> 00:35:05.878
I need you to take
a beat and let this simmer.


389
00:35:08.381 --> 00:35:09.840
<i>Then I'm the mug, yeah?</i>

390
00:35:10.758 --> 00:35:13.010
<i>Going to the hole for them cunts.</i>

391
00:35:14.095 --> 00:35:15.638
<i>It don't simmer a man.</i>

392
00:35:17.765 --> 00:35:19.225
<i>It only begins to boil.</i>

393
00:35:21.811 --> 00:35:23.437
Just remove the bedding, Marcus.

394
00:35:23.521 --> 00:35:24.980
We need to come inside, mate.

395
00:35:26.357 --> 00:35:28.442
Look, you fucking tell
the governor I won't move


396
00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:30.694
and if any of you try to come,
if any of you fucking try it...


397
00:35:30.778 --> 00:35:32.279
- Marcus...
- Fuck that!


398
00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:35.658
I'll open you up! I'll open you up,
I'm fucking telling you!


399
00:35:35.741 --> 00:35:38.035
- Pricks!
- Just remove your bedding.


400
00:35:38.119 --> 00:35:39.537
Make sure you're not injured.

401
00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:42.623
And that it's safe for us
to come in and talk, okay?


402
00:35:42.706 --> 00:35:43.833
Fuck off!

403
00:35:43.916 --> 00:35:46.293
You come in, I'm telling
you, if you fucking come in,


404
00:35:46.377 --> 00:35:48.671
I'll open you up, 
I'll open you up.

405
00:35:48.754 --> 00:35:50.965
So you get the fucking
governor down here now!


406
00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:52.591
The governor's on his way, son.

407
00:35:52.675 --> 00:35:54.468
Just remove the shield, come on.

408
00:35:57.638 --> 00:35:59.723
The fuck are you on about, man?

409
00:35:59.807 --> 00:36:01.559
Fuck!

410
00:36:02.977 --> 00:36:04.270
We can talk this out, all right, Marcus?

411
00:36:04.353 --> 00:36:06.439
Come on, just open the door, please.

412
00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:08.524
- You come in-
- Come on, open the door!


413
00:36:08.607 --> 00:36:11.152
Fuck that! You can't,
fuck you, you can fuck off, yeah?


414
00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:14.822
I will stab the first
one who enters, yeah?


415
00:36:15.906 --> 00:36:18.534
Fucking test me. 
Fucking test me.

416
00:36:26.375 --> 00:36:27.710
What's going on?

417
00:36:31.338 --> 00:36:32.173
Marcus.

418
00:36:33.007 --> 00:36:33.841
It's Steve.

419
00:36:35.301 --> 00:36:36.135
Steve.

420
00:36:39.889 --> 00:36:42.433
You gotta act out
to get me out of solitary?


421
00:36:45.686 --> 00:36:47.146
Sorry, man, I didn't mean for them...

422
00:36:47.229 --> 00:36:50.399
Don't be sorry. 
It's good to stretch.

423
00:36:54.653 --> 00:36:56.822
- They want me to talk you down.
- Nah, man.


424
00:36:57.656 --> 00:37:00.743
If I open these doors,
I'll be back on the wing in a month.


425
00:37:00.826 --> 00:37:02.745
Listen to me, at this rate,

426
00:37:02.828 --> 00:37:05.289
you're gonna be my neighbour
for the rest of the year.


427
00:37:05.372 --> 00:37:09.001
Come on, kid. Look, they want you
to take down them sheets.


428
00:37:10.544 --> 00:37:12.379
No, I ain't doin' this, Steve, man.

429
00:37:12.463 --> 00:37:15.090
They ain't helping me,
so I ain't making it easy for them.


430
00:37:15.174 --> 00:37:16.425
What's going on?

431
00:37:17.927 --> 00:37:20.346
Lost my fucking mind ever
since you've been gone, man.


432
00:37:20.971 --> 00:37:22.640
I'm on lockdown most of
the fucking time today


433
00:37:22.723 --> 00:37:24.558
'cause I'm a fucking target!

434
00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:27.353
- For who?
- The usual pricks, man!


435
00:37:27.436 --> 00:37:30.189
Look, I need a transfer.
I need a transfer.


436
00:37:30.272 --> 00:37:32.608
My dad is dishing out
a bag a month to them,


437
00:37:32.691 --> 00:37:34.235
and he can't afford it.

438
00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:38.614
And the boy don't give a fuck,
so I've gotta make a move.


439
00:37:43.786 --> 00:37:45.496
- Steve?
- I'm here.


440
00:37:45.579 --> 00:37:47.581
I'm just asking this lot if it's true.

441
00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:49.583
Of course, it's fuckin' true, man!

442
00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:50.834
Of course, it's fuckin' true, man!

443
00:37:50.918 --> 00:37:53.254
I'm watching myself
every day in here, Steve.


444
00:37:54.255 --> 00:37:57.007
I'm taking a hiding
and my dad is getting threats.


445
00:37:58.092 --> 00:38:01.095
And these pricks ain't doing
nothing to help nothing!


446
00:38:01.178 --> 00:38:02.388
Do you wanna let me in?

447
00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:13.107
I can't, man.

448
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.984
It's so fucked.

449
00:38:15.067 --> 00:38:18.946
Listen, mate.
You have to do this, all right?


450
00:38:19.029 --> 00:38:20.864
The governor ain't coming in.

451
00:38:20.948 --> 00:38:23.951
These fucking rules
means he can't bend them.


452
00:38:24.034 --> 00:38:26.996
He shows up for you,
the next geezer's gonna throw his lug.


453
00:38:35.754 --> 00:38:36.839
- What's he doing?
- Eh?


454
00:38:36.922 --> 00:38:39.091
- What's he doing?
- I'm fucked if I know.


455
00:38:41.802 --> 00:38:42.636
Marcus.

456
00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:45.431
How do you see this playing out, pal?

457
00:38:49.018 --> 00:38:50.269
He's gone mute.

458
00:38:54.857 --> 00:38:56.567
Marcus, open it up, will ya?

459
00:38:59.570 --> 00:39:00.779
Open it up.

460
00:39:00.863 --> 00:39:02.197
Marcus, I'm coming in.

461
00:39:02.281 --> 00:39:03.907
And I'm fucking warning ya,

462
00:39:03.991 --> 00:39:06.243
you chuck piss on me,
I'm gonna knock you fucking spark out.


463
00:39:09.955 --> 00:39:11.206
Fuck, fuck.

464
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:13.584
No, no, no, no, no!

465
00:39:49.662 --> 00:39:52.331
<i>He'll be back once his
medical evaluations are complete.</i>


466
00:39:53.624 --> 00:39:54.458
<i>A week or two.</i>

467
00:39:56.085 --> 00:39:57.753
<i>Think we can count on you, Steve?</i>

468
00:40:01.965 --> 00:40:03.509
<i>He feels safer with you around.</i>

469
00:40:04.677 --> 00:40:06.970
<i>Maybe this could be
your calling, Mr. Mackelson.</i>


470
00:40:11.058 --> 00:40:13.394
<i>Looking out for him does not
mean causing others harm.</i>


471
00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:15.020
<i>It does not give you any power.</i>

472
00:40:16.021 --> 00:40:19.024
<i>But perhaps starts the paying
off your debts to our society.</i>


473
00:40:21.026 --> 00:40:22.903
<i>Can you be forgiven? 
Of course.</i>

474
00:40:23.904 --> 00:40:25.406
<i>Trusted?</i>

475
00:40:25.489 --> 00:40:26.323
<i>Well...</i>

476
00:40:27.241 --> 00:40:28.075
<i>We shall see.</i>

477
00:40:42.297 --> 00:40:44.174
- You wanted a word?
- Yeah.


478
00:40:44.883 --> 00:40:46.260
Thanks for coming. Sit down.

479
00:40:54.143 --> 00:40:56.270
Do me a favour and leave him alone.

480
00:40:56.937 --> 00:40:58.355
What are you, his old man?

481
00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:02.568
Kid's got a seven stretch.
He can be done in four.


482
00:41:02.651 --> 00:41:04.236
He's got no weight on your game.

483
00:41:05.654 --> 00:41:07.030
Let it slide.

484
00:41:07.114 --> 00:41:09.867
He gets gear bought in,
he's up against me.


485
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:12.119
He gets fucking gear
off of one of your lot.


486
00:41:12.202 --> 00:41:14.872
Then you turn him over.
The kid's getting double fucked.


487
00:41:14.955 --> 00:41:17.332
Oh, it's funny, yeah?

488
00:41:17.416 --> 00:41:20.794
Look, bruv. He knows how it goes,
you know how it goes.


489
00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:22.963
The fucking SOs know how it goes.

490
00:41:23.046 --> 00:41:25.090
You gotta earn your muscle.

491
00:41:25.174 --> 00:41:27.676
He gives Scotty the push,
he's gotta have accountability.


492
00:41:28.343 --> 00:41:29.928
I'm asking you to leave it be.

493
00:41:31.138 --> 00:41:33.182
- Why should I?
- Because I'm asking ya.


494
00:41:34.975 --> 00:41:36.977
You're a geezer, Steve,
I respect you, bruv,


495
00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:39.146
but this, this ain't about you.

496
00:41:39.688 --> 00:41:40.898
This ain't for you, blood.

497
00:41:41.899 --> 00:41:43.567
I'm asking you to leave it alone.

498
00:41:43.942 --> 00:41:46.945
And I am telling you as
nicely as I'm willing to be.


499
00:41:47.029 --> 00:41:49.865
He gets up on my business,
then he's gotta take the cons.


500
00:41:53.535 --> 00:41:55.329
Who's putting the squeeze on his old man?

501
00:41:56.914 --> 00:41:58.582
Someone's gotta big mouth.

502
00:41:58.957 --> 00:42:01.960
Look, Danny, you know me.
You know where I'm from.


503
00:42:02.169 --> 00:42:04.129
A long time ago, Steve. 
Things change.

504
00:42:04.213 --> 00:42:05.714
I know, but I still know the flats.

505
00:42:06.256 --> 00:42:09.802
I'm sure you do but everyone
you knew left with the fires.


506
00:42:09.885 --> 00:42:13.055
The old block of tenements went up
and now with the rebuild,


507
00:42:13.138 --> 00:42:14.765
it's looking like the fucking docklands,

508
00:42:14.848 --> 00:42:16.767
so no, I don't
think anyone there told you

509
00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:18.936
about the extortion from Papa.

510
00:42:20.479 --> 00:42:22.523
I think you're trying to protect a grass.

511
00:42:25.275 --> 00:42:26.693
I told you.

512
00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:29.988
I came here out of respect
for you, Stevie.


513
00:42:30.072 --> 00:42:33.325
But I got no debt to you. 
I got no fear.

514
00:42:34.159 --> 00:42:36.703
You love to carve people up,
that used to go a long way,


515
00:42:36.787 --> 00:42:38.038
but I've got as much bottle

516
00:42:38.121 --> 00:42:40.958
and my fear factor is fuckin' zilch.

517
00:42:42.334 --> 00:42:45.128
Your reputation,
it deserves a conversation,


518
00:42:45.796 --> 00:42:49.716
but when it's affecting my business,
or slowing my days,


519
00:42:51.176 --> 00:42:53.178
you ain't gonna fuckin'
hear what you want to.


520
00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:55.639
How old are you now?

521
00:42:56.223 --> 00:42:57.891
That don't even fuckin' matter.

522
00:42:57.975 --> 00:43:00.435
Stand up.

523
00:43:00.519 --> 00:43:01.395
Nah.

524
00:43:01.478 --> 00:43:03.230
- I said stand up.
- Why?


525
00:43:03.313 --> 00:43:05.691
'Cause I want you to do
something I'm telling you to do.


526
00:43:05.774 --> 00:43:06.900
Now, stand up.

527
00:43:06.984 --> 00:43:08.485
All right, listen.

528
00:43:08.569 --> 00:43:13.240
I swear to you,
I will stand, and I will leave,


529
00:43:13.907 --> 00:43:16.535
'cause this will get to a place
you don't want it to go.


530
00:43:16.618 --> 00:43:19.872
You don't wanna see the
fuckin' darkness, all right?


531
00:43:19.955 --> 00:43:21.456
So, next time, 
I'm telling you now,

532
00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.667
you're gonna fuckin' ask nicely.

533
00:43:24.042 --> 00:43:25.878
This is the fucking nicest I'm gonna be.

534
00:43:25.961 --> 00:43:28.422
I'll take your fucking head right off,
do you understand me?


535
00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:29.381
Do you understand me?

536
00:43:29.464 --> 00:43:30.716
You're gonna have to fucking kill me.

537
00:43:30.799 --> 00:43:32.593
You leave a mark on
me and I'll have ya.

538
00:43:34.052 --> 00:43:35.387
The fuck you doing?

539
00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:37.681
You had your chance,
now I'm gonna fucking take mine.


540
00:43:43.645 --> 00:43:45.439
Better not have AIDS, you cunt.

541
00:43:52.112 --> 00:43:52.946
Frank!

542
00:44:01.413 --> 00:44:02.956
Fuck sake.

543
00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.041
Bin these.

544
00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:11.715
Brooks!

545
00:44:11.798 --> 00:44:12.966
SO!

546
00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:14.426
- He went for me!
- Who?


547
00:44:14.509 --> 00:44:16.553
- The big fella!
- Who is it?


548
00:44:16.637 --> 00:44:19.640
Wilson!
Be on your toes, he's sharp!


549
00:44:19.723 --> 00:44:21.600
Don't fucking move, Mackelson!

550
00:44:21.683 --> 00:44:22.935
I ain't going nowhere.

551
00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.103
Am I, sweetheart?

552
00:44:25.187 --> 00:44:26.563
Do you have a weapon on you?

553
00:44:26.647 --> 00:44:28.148
No, just his tool!

554
00:44:28.231 --> 00:44:30.150
Step off! Get on the ground!

555
00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.403
Wish you could see this.

556
00:44:33.487 --> 00:44:35.864
- Jeff, on me, now.
- Use your good eye.


557
00:44:56.468 --> 00:44:57.803
What is it with this kid?

558
00:44:59.513 --> 00:45:01.306
He just reminds me of me.

559
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.185
Kid from the estates.

560
00:45:06.978 --> 00:45:09.481
You know, becoming
a product of your environment,


561
00:45:09.564 --> 00:45:11.483
it is hard and it becomes your reality.

562
00:45:12.776 --> 00:45:14.027
And it either fires you up,

563
00:45:15.445 --> 00:45:18.323
or it makes you lash out,
down to the lack of opportunity.


564
00:45:21.076 --> 00:45:22.411
And I see that.

565
00:45:23.203 --> 00:45:24.204
I see that in him.

566
00:45:27.249 --> 00:45:28.250
Opportunity.

567
00:45:30.585 --> 00:45:32.129
No one ever gave me a look out.

568
00:45:34.464 --> 00:45:35.382
That's why I took this path

569
00:45:35.465 --> 00:45:37.300
and I ended up
here, the same as you.

570
00:45:37.384 --> 00:45:38.885
Maybe it's his path to take.

571
00:45:39.594 --> 00:45:40.429
Maybe.

572
00:45:41.346 --> 00:45:44.433
If you could change yours now, would ya?

573
00:45:46.393 --> 00:45:47.519
Takes time, right?

574
00:45:48.311 --> 00:45:49.855
Comes with age, Steve.

575
00:45:50.188 --> 00:45:51.189
Kid's a pup.

576
00:45:52.607 --> 00:45:53.900
He ain't listening to you.

577
00:45:55.819 --> 00:45:57.154
Now it's on you.

578
00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:00.657
Little fuckers wanna take their shot.

579
00:46:00.824 --> 00:46:02.743
Give it the big
'un when they get out.

580
00:46:04.244 --> 00:46:06.288
It's a badge of honour, to wear.

581
00:46:07.581 --> 00:46:10.041
Taking a pop at Steve Mackelson?

582
00:46:11.251 --> 00:46:12.627
Instant status on the out.

583
00:46:15.422 --> 00:46:16.840
You don't wanna be the weak one,

584
00:46:16.923 --> 00:46:19.259
not in the way you go out,
I get that, but...


585
00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:25.098
just saying, it's a risk
right now and for what, hm?


586
00:46:25.932 --> 00:46:27.017
For what?

587
00:46:27.559 --> 00:46:28.727
Kid's opportunity?

588
00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:31.730
I don't even think it's about him.

589
00:46:33.023 --> 00:46:34.733
I mean, I've got 30
odd years on the boy.

590
00:46:34.816 --> 00:46:36.151
I've got a daughter his age.

591
00:46:36.234 --> 00:46:37.944
I mean, that makes little sense.

592
00:46:41.239 --> 00:46:42.365
I'm a violent man.

593
00:46:44.618 --> 00:46:46.077
I got ire in the blood.

594
00:46:46.495 --> 00:46:50.415
Part of me thinks I'm just
a fucking no-good toe-rag


595
00:46:50.499 --> 00:46:52.751
who loves cracking cunts in the jaw.

596
00:46:52.834 --> 00:46:54.878
But I don't give a
fuck about the tear up.

597
00:46:56.296 --> 00:46:57.672
I got no red zone.

598
00:46:57.756 --> 00:46:58.840
I'm here...

599
00:46:59.925 --> 00:47:01.760
so I might as
well be in contention.


600
00:47:02.427 --> 00:47:04.679
The difference with me
is I could go further.


601
00:47:05.847 --> 00:47:09.059
I don't feel nothing. 
I don't feel shit.

602
00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:14.064
I can stab ya, cut ya,

603
00:47:14.147 --> 00:47:16.316
slash ya, and hack ya,

604
00:47:17.859 --> 00:47:19.611
and I don't feel a thing.

605
00:47:19.694 --> 00:47:20.654
Nothing.

606
00:47:23.448 --> 00:47:26.618
I've tried to feel something, anything.

607
00:47:28.662 --> 00:47:30.956
But I would take a life
like you jump the queue.


608
00:47:34.501 --> 00:47:35.836
Maybe that's my penance.

609
00:47:37.629 --> 00:47:39.089
You know, maybe that's why I'm doing it.

610
00:47:45.846 --> 00:47:47.180
Were you born this way?

611
00:47:48.974 --> 00:47:50.183
Must've been.

612
00:47:52.269 --> 00:47:53.645
Did you kill at my age?

613
00:47:55.021 --> 00:47:56.690
No, no, no, no.

614
00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:03.321
I wasn't one of them horrible
geezers who set cats on fire.


615
00:48:07.158 --> 00:48:11.746
I remember once,
at school, back in the fields,


616
00:48:14.165 --> 00:48:17.836
some kids, they found
a rabbit caught in a fence.


617
00:48:19.838 --> 00:48:22.215
It was already dead but
it had been there a while.


618
00:48:24.259 --> 00:48:25.719
And we all just stared at it.

619
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:31.016
And that was the first time
that I'd seen anything lifeless.


620
00:48:35.645 --> 00:48:38.106
And after a while,
a couple of the boys, they, um,


621
00:48:39.566 --> 00:48:41.067
started poking it with sticks.

622
00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:44.237
Sorta kicking it, you know?

623
00:48:44.321 --> 00:48:45.697
Timidly at first.

624
00:48:48.533 --> 00:48:51.745
But then after a while,
it got harder and heavier.


625
00:48:52.746 --> 00:48:54.247
And harder.

626
00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:57.834
And I'm standing there
and I'm watching these cunts


627
00:48:57.918 --> 00:49:01.963
fucking kick and stamp
on this dead rabbit's head.


628
00:49:04.633 --> 00:49:06.217
And I heard that skull crack.

629
00:49:08.428 --> 00:49:10.388
And the skin split from the bone.

630
00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:13.141
Claret everywhere.

631
00:49:14.559 --> 00:49:17.187
And they're all laughing
and egging each other on.


632
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:19.648
Living in it, loving the carnage.

633
00:49:24.152 --> 00:49:26.488
Then they kicked that rabbit
until its head come off.


634
00:49:30.575 --> 00:49:32.077
And that was the first time...

635
00:49:34.996 --> 00:49:36.831
The first time that I felt true rage.

636
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.251
<i>You gonna die in here?</i>

637
00:49:42.253 --> 00:49:43.505
I don't know. Probably.

638
00:49:45.256 --> 00:49:46.508
<i>Do you care?</i>

639
00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:48.468
What, about her?

640
00:49:49.886 --> 00:49:50.720
No.

641
00:49:51.972 --> 00:49:53.515
No, I fucking hate her.

642
00:49:54.724 --> 00:49:56.935
She betrayed me, she betrayed you.

643
00:49:59.437 --> 00:50:00.563
And that cunt with her.

644
00:50:02.107 --> 00:50:04.567
He fucking got it
as well. He got it.

645
00:50:05.568 --> 00:50:08.238
I showed you, bruv, didn't I?

646
00:50:08.321 --> 00:50:10.031
I showed ya.

647
00:50:14.619 --> 00:50:16.621
Do you wanna meet her?

648
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.548
Fuck, no,
it's hard. No, I don't know.


649
00:50:28.383 --> 00:50:29.968
I mean, you imagine...

650
00:50:31.803 --> 00:50:35.890
You imagine a girl grows
up with no mom, nor a man,


651
00:50:38.893 --> 00:50:40.603
and the little girl gets butchered.

652
00:50:42.605 --> 00:50:43.606
Fucking butchered.

653
00:50:45.066 --> 00:50:46.651
Fucking stabbed, you cunt.

654
00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:50.238
Fucking hacked and fucking stabbed

655
00:50:50.321 --> 00:50:52.032
and fucking hacked, you...

656
00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:56.161
Fuck you!

657
00:50:56.244 --> 00:50:57.620
Fuck you!

658
00:50:57.704 --> 00:50:59.039
Fuck you!

659
00:50:59.122 --> 00:50:59.956
Fuck! Fuck you!

660
00:51:07.547 --> 00:51:08.381
Fuck you.

661
00:51:27.358 --> 00:51:29.069
I can't do this anymore, man.

662
00:51:34.282 --> 00:51:36.409
In here, I'm fucked.
Out there, I'm fucked.


663
00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:39.704
Screws don't even let me
on my four hour in seg.


664
00:51:43.124 --> 00:51:45.210
I can't do this for another four, man.

665
00:51:46.211 --> 00:51:49.714
And I fight back, it's not like
I'm weak, but the more I do,


666
00:51:49.798 --> 00:51:52.050
the more my family's getting
pressured on the estate.


667
00:51:55.136 --> 00:51:56.805
If I turn up against it in here,

668
00:51:56.888 --> 00:51:58.348
then I'm just gonna get extended

669
00:51:58.431 --> 00:51:59.641
and that ain't a option, man.

670
00:52:03.019 --> 00:52:04.270
The only way I can get it done

671
00:52:04.354 --> 00:52:06.689
is if I keep on selling their gear.

672
00:52:06.773 --> 00:52:08.775
At least then I'll still have some value.

673
00:52:11.653 --> 00:52:13.947
The system wins,
then I just start kind of...


674
00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.657
I'm just tired of it, man.

675
00:52:18.827 --> 00:52:20.370
'Cause I can't have you
steppin' up for me all the time


676
00:52:20.453 --> 00:52:21.663
'cause eventually you're
gonna get tired of it


677
00:52:21.746 --> 00:52:23.206
and then what, where to then?

678
00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:25.834
I've gotta get out, right?

679
00:52:26.334 --> 00:52:28.920
Either through a cracked neck
or through the courts.


680
00:52:31.631 --> 00:52:33.466
I ain't ever killed no one,
I ain't ever opened anybody up.


681
00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:35.468
I don't know what to do
or how that's done.


682
00:52:41.975 --> 00:52:43.434
Sound like a fuckin' cry-baby, man,

683
00:52:43.518 --> 00:52:45.145
but those are my options, right?

684
00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:48.231
Either stab them up or take what's comin'.

685
00:52:49.399 --> 00:52:50.733
Fuckin' screws don't give a fuck.

686
00:52:50.817 --> 00:52:52.527
Another blood of their streets.
Place is full of us.


687
00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:54.028
Why they comin' after me?

688
00:52:56.489 --> 00:52:57.907
Why they comin' after me, man?

689
00:53:00.201 --> 00:53:01.995
I gotta start stabbing 'em up
and take the extra years?


690
00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:05.081
Fuck, what choice is that?
What fuckin' choice is that, man?


691
00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.429
You are not allowed to crack.

692
00:53:19.512 --> 00:53:20.680
Smarten up.

693
00:53:42.702 --> 00:53:45.955
Then I hope you can forget
the suffering you've endured.


694
00:53:47.332 --> 00:53:49.000
The suffering they've caused you.

695
00:53:51.252 --> 00:53:52.086
But...

696
00:53:53.171 --> 00:53:56.090
If you are guilty and you know...

697
00:53:57.008 --> 00:53:59.385
and this
earthly justice hasn't got you yet,


698
00:54:01.512 --> 00:54:04.390
then I hope you own
that guilt for your sake.


699
00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:09.395
Because your life ends with a final trial.

700
00:54:10.772 --> 00:54:11.606
No revisions.

701
00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:13.608
No parole.

702
00:54:14.859 --> 00:54:16.236
No hope.

703
00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:19.530
I gave up on
hope a long time ago.

704
00:54:19.739 --> 00:54:20.573
Sorry?

705
00:54:22.158 --> 00:54:25.036
Oh, no, no.
Nothing, sorry, I was just, uh...


706
00:54:25.828 --> 00:54:26.663
Nothing.

707
00:54:27.705 --> 00:54:28.790
Are you okay, Steve?

708
00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:32.710
You know, part of me sees it.

709
00:54:33.878 --> 00:54:37.131
Sees the good in it.
The healing of it, the...


710
00:54:38.591 --> 00:54:40.260
The closure, whatever you wanna call it.

711
00:54:44.222 --> 00:54:45.056
And?

712
00:54:50.603 --> 00:54:52.397
I don't think I can do this.

713
00:54:55.108 --> 00:54:56.359
I mean, I can...

714
00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:00.154
I can do most
things, but this is, uh...

715
00:55:01.447 --> 00:55:02.740
This is...

716
00:55:02.824 --> 00:55:04.784
It's bound to be uncomfortable.

717
00:55:06.536 --> 00:55:08.079
It's bound to be unfamiliar.

718
00:55:10.039 --> 00:55:12.625
Unfamiliarity is a trigger for anxiety.

719
00:55:14.168 --> 00:55:15.128
The unknown, right?

720
00:55:15.211 --> 00:55:17.005
Why put us both through something

721
00:55:17.088 --> 00:55:18.715
as uncomfortable as this?

722
00:55:20.425 --> 00:55:22.010
I mean, what is the endgame?

723
00:55:23.428 --> 00:55:26.055
It's not like we get something
out of it, is it? It's...


724
00:55:27.515 --> 00:55:29.434
You know, not like a relationship.

725
00:55:30.768 --> 00:55:31.602
A future.

726
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:38.026
It's all just a fucking show-and-tell.

727
00:55:39.444 --> 00:55:40.987
It's a run-around, it's a getup.

728
00:55:43.906 --> 00:55:45.950
I mean, what does
she want out of this?

729
00:55:46.034 --> 00:55:47.285
You know what she wants.

730
00:55:47.368 --> 00:55:48.453
Do I?

731
00:55:48.536 --> 00:55:49.704
Yeah.

732
00:55:50.079 --> 00:55:51.873
She either wants a start
or she wants it finished.


733
00:55:51.956 --> 00:55:53.333
A start to what?

734
00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:55.710
A tick on the visitors list?

735
00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:58.463
And if she wants it finished,
then she should let it lie.


736
00:55:58.546 --> 00:55:59.589
Close the door on it.

737
00:56:00.465 --> 00:56:02.717
I mean, I'm up for it.
I'm fucking banged up.


738
00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:07.638
Let her live with the story,

739
00:56:09.057 --> 00:56:10.141
and put it to bed.

740
00:56:11.225 --> 00:56:14.020
As someone who had no say

741
00:56:14.354 --> 00:56:16.522
in how her formative years were presented,

742
00:56:16.606 --> 00:56:17.690
that's a tough ask.

743
00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:22.403
We're here to protect you.

744
00:56:24.238 --> 00:56:25.990
If you say no, we say no.

745
00:56:27.408 --> 00:56:29.994
But you do have to take
ownership of the fact


746
00:56:30.078 --> 00:56:31.871
that you do have a daughter, Steve.

747
00:56:31.954 --> 00:56:32.872
Flesh and blood.

748
00:56:33.748 --> 00:56:35.041
And she wants to meet you.

749
00:56:36.042 --> 00:56:36.959
Her father.

750
00:56:39.879 --> 00:56:41.547
What is your fear?

751
00:56:48.763 --> 00:56:50.098
<i>We responded around 21:10</i>

752
00:56:50.181 --> 00:56:51.599
<i>on the evening of March 4th.</i>

753
00:56:53.768 --> 00:56:56.104
<i>A horrendously
gruesome amount of blood</i>


754
00:56:56.187 --> 00:56:57.271
<i>pooled on the floors.</i>

755
00:57:00.358 --> 00:57:02.068
<i>A viciously malicious attack,</i>

756
00:57:02.151 --> 00:57:04.904
<i>void of all human compassion or emotion.</i>

757
00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.698
<i>Danger to society.</i>

758
00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:11.828
<i>We find the defendant guilty</i>

759
00:57:11.911 --> 00:57:13.413
<i>of murder in the first degree.</i>

760
00:57:14.288 --> 00:57:15.915
And so you fucking should have.

761
00:57:40.732 --> 00:57:41.858
What're you doing here?

762
00:57:45.445 --> 00:57:46.988
Got friends in high places.

763
00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:50.283
I said what're you doing <i>here?</i>

764
00:57:54.787 --> 00:57:56.956
They wanted me to have a
word about you. Sit down.


765
00:57:58.958 --> 00:58:01.669
Well, I'm not sure this
has fuck-all to do with you.


766
00:58:10.636 --> 00:58:12.346
Her grandmother never moved out.

767
00:58:13.556 --> 00:58:14.807
So we see your kid a lot.

768
00:58:16.225 --> 00:58:17.935
Some logic in there somewhere.

769
00:58:21.814 --> 00:58:22.815
Do you want a tea?

770
00:58:25.151 --> 00:58:26.861
I see they've given you privileges.

771
00:58:27.904 --> 00:58:29.739
Trust me, I've had to earn 'em.

772
00:58:29.822 --> 00:58:31.407
After all you've done.

773
00:58:33.618 --> 00:58:35.828
You know,
that's the good thing about time.


774
00:58:37.872 --> 00:58:38.748
It passes.

775
00:58:40.666 --> 00:58:43.169
And prison loosens
the noose after a few years.


776
00:58:45.129 --> 00:58:47.715
You know, it's more forgiving
in some ways than out there.


777
00:58:50.134 --> 00:58:52.094
As long as you keep your
murders to one every few years,


778
00:58:52.178 --> 00:58:53.346
they're lenient, right?

779
00:58:59.143 --> 00:59:00.728
I was having a look at the poem.

780
00:59:01.896 --> 00:59:03.523
- Is it yours?
- No.


781
00:59:04.607 --> 00:59:06.943
The Argyllshire Highlanders.

782
00:59:07.652 --> 00:59:08.903
What's it about?

783
00:59:09.654 --> 00:59:10.863
The Glencoe murders.

784
00:59:11.739 --> 00:59:13.199
I don't know what that is.

785
00:59:13.282 --> 00:59:14.659
Well, look it up.

786
00:59:14.742 --> 00:59:15.993
I mean, you with your Irish links,

787
00:59:16.077 --> 00:59:18.788
I thought you'd be double
polished up on your Celtic roots.


788
00:59:20.665 --> 00:59:22.458
So that's how you
pass your time, is it?

789
00:59:22.542 --> 00:59:24.335
Reading and poetry?

790
00:59:24.418 --> 00:59:27.088
Well, it's better than sucking cock
and doing the fucking laundry.


791
00:59:29.257 --> 00:59:30.758
I'm walking out of here a man.

792
00:59:32.343 --> 00:59:34.345
So I might as
well be a well-versed one.

793
00:59:35.513 --> 00:59:37.849
It's interesting that you
think you'll be leaving.


794
00:59:39.475 --> 00:59:40.977
You know that's not an option, right?

795
00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:42.186
I mean, I hope you know.

796
00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:43.563
Lying in your coffin's

797
00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:45.064
the only way you get past these walls.

798
00:59:45.147 --> 00:59:48.025
You are a ray of sunshine, aren't ya?

799
00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:52.196
That's why I think
you owe it to the kid.


800
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.448
What the fuck do
you know about the kid?

801
00:59:55.950 --> 00:59:57.952
I know she's got her mother's genes.

802
00:59:58.035 --> 00:59:59.745
Oh, she's a cunt an' all, is she?

803
01:00:09.463 --> 01:00:11.007
I don't get it, the poem.

804
01:00:11.090 --> 01:00:12.383
I don't need you to.

805
01:00:14.802 --> 01:00:16.387
You don't need much. Never did.

806
01:00:18.764 --> 01:00:20.975
But I am glad to see you
putting your mind to something.


807
01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:23.853
At least scraping the wall
will keep your head right.


808
01:00:23.936 --> 01:00:24.979
How long you staying?

809
01:00:26.188 --> 01:00:27.315
That's down to you.

810
01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:41.704
How's Mom?

811
01:00:44.749 --> 01:00:45.917
Gettin' older.

812
01:00:48.753 --> 01:00:50.755
So she gave up
on the visits then, yeah?

813
01:00:51.964 --> 01:00:53.299
Her son's a nasty cunt.

814
01:00:54.675 --> 01:00:56.427
She gave up on
him a long time ago.

815
01:00:57.428 --> 01:00:58.471
She blames herself.

816
01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:00.890
It's not her fault.

817
01:01:02.183 --> 01:01:03.893
Well, it's fair, 
I mean, you were a...

818
01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.521
An unhealthy kid.

819
01:01:08.105 --> 01:01:09.148
Lost kid.

820
01:01:09.899 --> 01:01:12.109
Angry all the time, angry at time.

821
01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:16.614
You've been pissed off
since you were 14 years old.


822
01:01:18.157 --> 01:01:20.701
She holds onto that. 
Feels accountable.

823
01:01:22.411 --> 01:01:24.413
She can wipe her hands of it.
It's not her fault.


824
01:01:25.998 --> 01:01:27.249
I'm here on my own merit.

825
01:01:28.793 --> 01:01:30.002
Still doesn't keep you from repeating

826
01:01:30.086 --> 01:01:31.379
your actions, though, does it?

827
01:01:31.462 --> 01:01:34.382
- What is this, a lecture?
- Just stating facts.


828
01:01:34.465 --> 01:01:35.299
Well, don't.

829
01:01:36.509 --> 01:01:38.219
Because in here, I survive.

830
01:01:39.387 --> 01:01:43.140
Her accountability ended
the moment I got free will.


831
01:01:43.307 --> 01:01:45.643
What happened out there,
I can't help her with that.


832
01:01:47.061 --> 01:01:48.062
But in here?

833
01:01:49.814 --> 01:01:51.315
In here, it's a rebirth.

834
01:01:52.984 --> 01:01:54.819
You know they want me to kiss arse?

835
01:01:54.902 --> 01:01:56.028
But you know what they say.

836
01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:58.781
You kiss too much arse,
you end up chokin' on shit.


837
01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:01.367
Well, I ain't going that way,

838
01:02:01.951 --> 01:02:05.162
because I belong to
no man and no one.

839
01:02:08.416 --> 01:02:10.209
For a reason I can't understand,

840
01:02:13.379 --> 01:02:15.923
I picked up a knife
and I cut up someone who was...


841
01:02:17.717 --> 01:02:19.010
Who had no respect for me.

842
01:02:21.554 --> 01:02:23.139
And for another reason I can't understand,

843
01:02:23.222 --> 01:02:26.600
I can't stop myself from
doing it again and again.


844
01:02:27.393 --> 01:02:30.021
The shrinks can't work it out.
You can't work it out.


845
01:02:30.104 --> 01:02:31.439
I can't work it out.

846
01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.070
So do yourself a favour.

847
01:02:39.613 --> 01:02:43.159
Don't waste your time trying
to convince yourself otherwise.


848
01:02:45.953 --> 01:02:47.788
Now drink your tea. 
It's getting cold.

849
01:02:54.962 --> 01:02:56.172
- What happened?
- For fuck sake.


850
01:02:56.255 --> 01:02:58.215
- I'm just asking.
- Asking what?


851
01:02:58.883 --> 01:03:01.761
It ain't your fault, Dad,
and it ain't Mom's fault.


852
01:03:01.844 --> 01:03:03.220
And it ain't entirely mine.

853
01:03:07.224 --> 01:03:08.934
She fucking started it, she did.

854
01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:13.272
It all went into a situation
where I had to kill the geezer.


855
01:03:14.148 --> 01:03:16.734
I'm not talking about
just fucking hurt him,


856
01:03:16.817 --> 01:03:18.235
stab him a couple of
times and sayin' to him,


857
01:03:18.319 --> 01:03:21.030
"We're all good, brother, all sorted."

858
01:03:22.823 --> 01:03:23.657
No.

859
01:03:26.535 --> 01:03:28.370
I stabbed the living life out of him.

860
01:03:29.955 --> 01:03:32.833
I showed him what happens.
I showed him who the geezer was.


861
01:03:35.461 --> 01:03:37.963
She was just a fucking by-product.

862
01:03:40.758 --> 01:03:43.094
If she weren't there,
she'd still be alive now.


863
01:03:44.386 --> 01:03:45.971
Her timing was shit, that's all.

864
01:03:47.264 --> 01:03:49.308
It was her fucking fate
and you can't put that on me


865
01:03:49.391 --> 01:03:51.352
because that ain't planned.

866
01:03:56.482 --> 01:03:57.483
And that was that.

867
01:03:59.777 --> 01:04:01.112
And then it was done.

868
01:04:03.405 --> 01:04:04.240
I was done.

869
01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:08.869
As soon as I knew what it meant...

870
01:04:10.329 --> 01:04:11.956
and how it made me feel,

871
01:04:13.707 --> 01:04:15.167
I didn't give a fuck anymore.

872
01:04:17.878 --> 01:04:19.088
Life weren't important to me.

873
01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:23.259
And that is why I'm in here,

874
01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:25.511
and the rest of you are out there.

875
01:04:27.555 --> 01:04:29.098
I know you've done your bird,

876
01:04:30.808 --> 01:04:32.852
but you always knew you were getting out.

877
01:04:34.019 --> 01:04:35.729
I know I'm not leaving this place,

878
01:04:36.647 --> 01:04:37.690
and I'm good with that,

879
01:04:38.607 --> 01:04:40.317
'cause my legacy will be left here,

880
01:04:41.986 --> 01:04:45.322
and I am gonna make it
as memorable as possible.


881
01:04:48.075 --> 01:04:50.202
Do the right thing and see the kid.

882
01:04:50.286 --> 01:04:52.705
Say her name.
Go on, say her fucking name.


883
01:04:52.788 --> 01:04:53.706
You know it.

884
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:54.999
Do you?

885
01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:57.710
When was the last time you said it?

886
01:04:59.003 --> 01:05:01.422
When was the last time
you looked into her soul


887
01:05:01.505 --> 01:05:03.632
and offered any kind of
healing for what you did?


888
01:05:07.469 --> 01:05:10.097
Don't you dare sit there
and have the fucking audacity


889
01:05:10.181 --> 01:05:12.183
to pick me apart for not
having a relationship with her,


890
01:05:12.266 --> 01:05:14.435
'cause you took that away
from the lot of us, you cunt.


891
01:05:16.478 --> 01:05:18.439
Snatched away any resemblance of humanity

892
01:05:18.522 --> 01:05:20.191
from my side of the family.

893
01:05:22.693 --> 01:05:24.862
That child, Steve...

894
01:05:26.488 --> 01:05:28.324
Stripped of any connection to the two...

895
01:05:29.617 --> 01:05:33.954
fuck heads that brought her
into this mess of a life.


896
01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:38.500
You're going to hell
for what you did, son.


897
01:05:40.753 --> 01:05:42.963
That poor kid didn't
stand a fucking chance.


898
01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:49.470
But you know what? Hm?

899
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.641
She's got more courage
than the pair of ya.


900
01:05:57.102 --> 01:05:59.772
It's the only decent thing
she got from the merging of two


901
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:02.483
complete wastes of matter,

902
01:06:02.566 --> 01:06:04.318
and that makes me so fucking proud.

903
01:06:06.946 --> 01:06:09.990
I want her to meet ya.
I don't want her to forgive ya.


904
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:14.828
Because I know that'll
be more painful for you


905
01:06:14.912 --> 01:06:16.247
than for her to hate you.

906
01:06:17.998 --> 01:06:20.751
You're comfortable with hate.
It's how you function.


907
01:06:21.961 --> 01:06:24.880
And I want her to see what
a miserable excuse of a man


908
01:06:24.964 --> 01:06:27.132
you truly are and that
she's missed out on nothing.


909
01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:33.305
And I pray, Steve,
for your own sake, I pray,


910
01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:36.934
that you have an aching in your being.

911
01:06:38.185 --> 01:06:39.812
Something you can't hide from.

912
01:06:40.813 --> 01:06:42.231
Something you can't fight against.

913
01:06:45.442 --> 01:06:48.570
Because I have a feeling
that'll be the only time


914
01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:50.948
that you'll have a reason
to leave this world


915
01:06:51.031 --> 01:06:52.574
with any kind of grace.

916
01:06:57.413 --> 01:07:00.249
And you'll deserve every single
piece of that discomfort.


917
01:07:04.962 --> 01:07:08.090
I just wish it would scar
visibly as a daily reminder


918
01:07:09.008 --> 01:07:10.259
of who you are.

919
01:07:14.972 --> 01:07:16.557
I'm my father's son.

920
01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:07.566
You got the bottom bunk?

921
01:08:08.776 --> 01:08:10.110
Power position, bruv.

922
01:08:11.945 --> 01:08:12.863
Where's your cellmate?

923
01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:15.449
He's coming back.

924
01:08:15.532 --> 01:08:18.786
Aren't we nervous, cuz?
I'm just walking the wing.


925
01:08:18.869 --> 01:08:19.703
You know me.

926
01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.584
Street geezers tell me you're marked.

927
01:08:26.168 --> 01:08:27.795
Tell me you're on a payment plan.

928
01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:32.383
Bird's rough, init?
Makes you jumpy and shit.


929
01:08:33.759 --> 01:08:34.760
What you got on you?

930
01:08:35.928 --> 01:08:37.805
Look, I don't wanna strap up, man.

931
01:08:37.888 --> 01:08:38.931
What?

932
01:08:39.264 --> 01:08:41.225
Serious, bro. I'm not tightenin' up.

933
01:08:41.308 --> 01:08:43.102
Won't have to,
if you tell me what you got.


934
01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.187
- Ain't got nothing.
- Huh?


935
01:08:45.979 --> 01:08:47.898
I said I don't have anything.

936
01:08:47.981 --> 01:08:49.108
Come on, little man.

937
01:08:49.191 --> 01:08:51.193
You're forcing the
brothers to shake you down.


938
01:08:51.276 --> 01:08:52.319
We knows you got weed.

939
01:08:52.403 --> 01:08:54.488
We knows you got
peas in from your granny.

940
01:08:54.571 --> 01:08:56.740
Your family don't wanna see you
with your teeth knocked out.


941
01:08:57.449 --> 01:08:59.076
Probably best if you call your Nan again,

942
01:08:59.159 --> 01:09:00.953
and tell her you need some
more bread brought in.


943
01:09:01.495 --> 01:09:02.704
Where's your phone card?

944
01:09:07.626 --> 01:09:10.838
He won't be back for a bit.
They got him on mop-up.


945
01:09:10.921 --> 01:09:12.756
He's knee-deep in suds.

946
01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.799
And you know what happens to a grass,

947
01:09:13.882 --> 01:09:15.342
so you're saying nothing, bruv.

948
01:09:16.301 --> 01:09:18.637
Can't help you anyway.
He's got his own coming.


949
01:09:20.097 --> 01:09:22.891
Grab your phone card,
give the old girl a bell.


950
01:09:22.975 --> 01:09:23.976
I'll be right next to you,

951
01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:25.811
make sure you sound legit and that.

952
01:09:25.894 --> 01:09:28.105
Bro, I'm not calling my
fam while you're here, man.


953
01:09:28.897 --> 01:09:31.358
You'll do exactly what I tell you, cuz.

954
01:09:31.442 --> 01:09:34.403
Yeah, boss. Game ain't based on sympathy.

955
01:09:34.486 --> 01:09:35.904
Fuck do I have to lose?

956
01:09:37.489 --> 01:09:38.991
Yeah, you in it now.

957
01:09:39.074 --> 01:09:40.909
Play it or don't.

958
01:09:40.993 --> 01:09:42.536
You're in the fuckin'
lineup till you strap up


959
01:09:42.619 --> 01:09:44.079
and knock somebody out.

960
01:09:44.163 --> 01:09:47.040
Lined up. Beat down after beat down.

961
01:09:47.124 --> 01:09:49.835
Next bam, next bam!

962
01:09:51.628 --> 01:09:52.504
Yeah, pussy.

963
01:09:52.588 --> 01:09:55.215
White boy can't protect you.

964
01:09:55.299 --> 01:09:58.177
That's what happens when
you turn from your own.


965
01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.721
I ain't turned, bro. I never turn.

966
01:10:00.804 --> 01:10:02.890
Want it to stop? Stop it.

967
01:10:04.016 --> 01:10:07.519
Tool up, start carving, prove your stones.

968
01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:09.980
Until then, grab your card,

969
01:10:10.063 --> 01:10:11.815
and go and get me some money, cunt.

970
01:10:12.691 --> 01:10:14.401
If not, it's gettin' worse.

971
01:10:14.485 --> 01:10:17.196
I'll send some boys over to
gangbang her 90-year-old snatch


972
01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:18.864
and you can spit out your teeth.

973
01:10:19.948 --> 01:10:21.200
I play dark, bruv.

974
01:10:25.496 --> 01:10:26.830
Please, man.

975
01:10:26.914 --> 01:10:27.915
What you say?

976
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:29.958
Nothin'.

977
01:10:30.042 --> 01:10:31.793
You fuckin' beggin'?

978
01:10:32.252 --> 01:10:33.795
- Please, man.
- "Please, man", what?


979
01:10:33.879 --> 01:10:35.339
Fuck you!

980
01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:41.720
Fuck.

981
01:10:41.803 --> 01:10:43.347
What the fuck?

982
01:10:54.733 --> 01:10:55.567
Fuck.

983
01:10:58.195 --> 01:10:59.613
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

984
01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:10.809
I heard you got extended.

985
01:12:16.481 --> 01:12:17.899
Charging me with attempted.

986
01:12:24.281 --> 01:12:26.366
You might've been better
if you'd have killed the geezer.


987
01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:31.121
Well, not like I didn't try.

988
01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.207
It were close, I guess.

989
01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:39.171
Well, he's a cabbage now.

990
01:12:39.713 --> 01:12:41.214
You could say you done enough.

991
01:12:43.884 --> 01:12:44.885
Now's the hard part.

992
01:12:47.012 --> 01:12:47.929
Yeah.

993
01:12:48.013 --> 01:12:50.223
They're gonna be
waiting on ya, you know that?


994
01:12:51.308 --> 01:12:52.809
And I told the governor to transfer you

995
01:12:52.893 --> 01:12:54.186
or to keep you segged.

996
01:12:55.854 --> 01:12:57.898
He thought this was the wise move.

997
01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:01.610
And do you?

998
01:13:04.237 --> 01:13:06.281
I think you've got some
serious decisions to make.


999
01:13:09.409 --> 01:13:12.579
Look, I know I'm a dead man walking.

1000
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:17.334
I'm just trying to
come to terms with it.

1001
01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.419
And have ya?

1002
01:13:20.962 --> 01:13:21.838
What?

1003
01:13:21.922 --> 01:13:23.715
Come to terms with it.

1004
01:13:26.843 --> 01:13:27.719
I'd rather they kill me

1005
01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:29.638
than have them push my family around.

1006
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:34.935
My dad's stopped payin' 'em.

1007
01:13:36.144 --> 01:13:37.771
Told him there was no more need.

1008
01:13:40.732 --> 01:13:41.900
I'm good now.

1009
01:13:42.401 --> 01:13:43.985
So you've knocked the gear on the head?

1010
01:13:45.278 --> 01:13:46.905
Security's all over my post.

1011
01:13:46.988 --> 01:13:49.449
Anything that comes in is
just gettin' pulled apart now.


1012
01:13:52.369 --> 01:13:54.538
- I'm on amber alert.
- Well, lie low.


1013
01:13:56.123 --> 01:13:57.708
Get yourself a job somewhere busy.

1014
01:13:58.583 --> 01:14:00.377
You're gonna get a bit more
respect on the yard now.


1015
01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:01.878
That comes with a violent act.

1016
01:14:02.629 --> 01:14:03.463
Use it.

1017
01:14:06.216 --> 01:14:08.635
Anyone who laces up, puts it on ya,

1018
01:14:09.761 --> 01:14:11.346
is gonna need their head examined.

1019
01:14:13.014 --> 01:14:15.225
What you've got to worry about
now is Dwayne's little lot.


1020
01:14:17.352 --> 01:14:19.855
Expect retaliation,
'cause it's gonna happen. Trust me.


1021
01:14:22.649 --> 01:14:24.359
Your only decision from now on

1022
01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:27.279
is what type of prisoner you wanna be.

1023
01:14:28.739 --> 01:14:30.532
Whether you take the lumps
and you get out in ten,


1024
01:14:30.615 --> 01:14:32.367
or you become institutionalised.

1025
01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:41.251
The system's got ya.
It's down to you to see how tight.


1026
01:14:47.007 --> 01:14:48.633
I never wanted the fucking child.

1027
01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:52.345
Right.

1028
01:14:57.851 --> 01:15:00.228
What's this supposed to do?
Stir up emotions?


1029
01:15:01.772 --> 01:15:02.606
Maybe.

1030
01:15:04.316 --> 01:15:05.734
Well, it doesn't.

1031
01:15:05.817 --> 01:15:06.818
It just doesn't.

1032
01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:10.781
But by taking away her mother,

1033
01:15:10.864 --> 01:15:14.367
you have a certain
responsibility, morally.


1034
01:15:16.828 --> 01:15:18.538
And what would
happen if I pulled out on this?


1035
01:15:23.502 --> 01:15:26.129
Well, it's all arranged, Steve.

1036
01:15:26.213 --> 01:15:27.506
Doing that now, last minute,

1037
01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:30.091
it will not be looked upon
favourably by the court.


1038
01:15:30.175 --> 01:15:31.134
You'll drop points.

1039
01:15:34.513 --> 01:15:36.890
There's no shame in
feeling nervous and scared.


1040
01:15:36.973 --> 01:15:38.809
It's perfectly normal.

1041
01:15:38.892 --> 01:15:39.726
Human.

1042
01:15:47.692 --> 01:15:48.944
Yeah, I'm scared.

1043
01:15:53.365 --> 01:15:54.199
Okay.

1044
01:15:59.746 --> 01:16:00.831
You should care.

1045
01:16:03.166 --> 01:16:04.334
You should live in your feelings,

1046
01:16:04.417 --> 01:16:06.419
of course, experience them.

1047
01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:11.341
And then let that young woman

1048
01:16:11.424 --> 01:16:13.510
finally have some sense of her own life.

1049
01:16:24.938 --> 01:16:26.106
Hello, lad!

1050
01:16:27.899 --> 01:16:28.900
You all right?

1051
01:16:31.319 --> 01:16:32.404
Got a hat for ya.

1052
01:16:33.697 --> 01:16:34.823
What the fuck is this all about?

1053
01:16:34.906 --> 01:16:36.324
Try the hat on, you'll suit the hat,
it will look good on ya.


1054
01:16:36.408 --> 01:16:38.243
- Get that away from me, man.
- What're you doin', lad?


1055
01:16:38.326 --> 01:16:39.911
I said put the fuckin' hat on.

1056
01:16:39.995 --> 01:16:41.788
What the fuck are you doing, man?

1057
01:16:44.749 --> 01:16:47.544
Put the fucking thing
on your head. Hurry up!


1058
01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:50.505
Bash his head in now! Hurry up!

1059
01:16:53.258 --> 01:16:55.343
- Again!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.


1060
01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.431
You're gonna have to be
smarter than that, son.


1061
01:17:00.265 --> 01:17:01.933
It's not about you, Steve, mate.

1062
01:17:02.017 --> 01:17:02.976
Yeah, it is.

1063
01:17:03.935 --> 01:17:04.769
Now take it off.

1064
01:17:09.733 --> 01:17:10.775
Take it off.

1065
01:17:19.951 --> 01:17:21.536
Head bleeds like a cunt, right?

1066
01:17:22.662 --> 01:17:23.955
I wanna give you two choices.

1067
01:17:25.832 --> 01:17:29.294
You can either have
a break, or a cut.

1068
01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:36.301
This is about him and Dwayne, all right?

1069
01:17:36.384 --> 01:17:38.553
No, no. This is about me and you.

1070
01:17:38.637 --> 01:17:40.263
And since you're the
one with all the mouth,


1071
01:17:40.347 --> 01:17:41.765
I take it that he's the hard cunt.

1072
01:17:41.848 --> 01:17:43.516
Are you the hard cunt?

1073
01:17:45.101 --> 01:17:46.770
He doesn't fucking
speak English, Steve, so...


1074
01:17:46.853 --> 01:17:47.979
Really?

1075
01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:50.065
You'll go a long way
and that could be in your favour.


1076
01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:53.276
Now, what arm?

1077
01:17:53.985 --> 01:17:55.695
- What?
- What arm do you want broken?


1078
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:58.865
Fuckin' try it, Steve. Go on.

1079
01:17:58.949 --> 01:18:00.200
I will. Now, what fuckin' arm?

1080
01:18:00.283 --> 01:18:03.036
Either that or it's an artery.
So, pick one.


1081
01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:06.122
At least let me go and get
a fuckin' tool so we're even.


1082
01:18:06.206 --> 01:18:07.916
- Init?
- No, mate.


1083
01:18:07.999 --> 01:18:09.209
You had your chance.

1084
01:18:09.292 --> 01:18:10.961
I wouldn't fuckin'
dream of jumpin' someone


1085
01:18:11.044 --> 01:18:13.004
in their cell without a fuckin' tool.

1086
01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:15.048
- You, Frank?
- Cunt's a mug.


1087
01:18:15.131 --> 01:18:16.549
Cunt's a mug.

1088
01:18:16.633 --> 01:18:18.426
Now get down on the fucking
floor and put your arm out.


1089
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:19.761
You're gonna have to
fuckin' kill me, lad.


1090
01:18:19.844 --> 01:18:21.429
You're gonna have to fucking kill me!
Do you hear me?


1091
01:18:23.765 --> 01:18:26.351
- Get off me now, fucking cock!
- Put your fucking arm out!


1092
01:18:26.434 --> 01:18:27.644
Stretch it out!

1093
01:18:27.727 --> 01:18:30.188
You haven't got the fucking balls,
you little pussy cunt!


1094
01:18:30.271 --> 01:18:31.481
Do it.

1095
01:18:31.564 --> 01:18:32.732
You want some of this?

1096
01:18:33.817 --> 01:18:35.527
- Fuck off!
- Big man, get up here.


1097
01:18:35.694 --> 01:18:39.239
Fucking stamp on his arm like
you mean it and use your heel.


1098
01:18:39.322 --> 01:18:40.865
No, please don't!

1099
01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:42.951
Fucking do it like you mean it!

1100
01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:44.160
Come on!

1101
01:18:44.244 --> 01:18:45.078
Do it.

1102
01:18:45.161 --> 01:18:48.164
Don't. Oh, my God,
don't, don't, don't, don't.


1103
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:20.613
<i>They come in waves.</i>

1104
01:19:21.906 --> 01:19:25.452
<i>Sometimes you're in a storm.
Every night they hit ya.</i>


1105
01:19:26.036 --> 01:19:27.912
<i>Then after a while, they slow down.</i>

1106
01:19:28.621 --> 01:19:29.706
<i>Less frequent.</i>

1107
01:19:32.292 --> 01:19:35.462
<i>When they hit, they still hit big.</i>

1108
01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:40.467
<i>Slowly over time,
they get smaller and smaller.</i>


1109
01:19:41.676 --> 01:19:45.055
<i>The water's calm. 
They mean less and less.</i>

1110
01:19:46.014 --> 01:19:48.808
<i>Sometimes, you welcome them
in to break up your days.</i>


1111
01:19:51.227 --> 01:19:52.395
<i>I kill in dreams.</i>

1112
01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:55.148
<i>I kill awake.</i>

1113
01:19:57.400 --> 01:19:58.401
<i>It makes no difference</i>

1114
01:19:58.485 --> 01:20:00.361
<i>as they've become
the same thing to me now.</i>


1115
01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:07.911
Her grandmother will be there.

1116
01:20:07.994 --> 01:20:10.205
A formal request was granted yesterday.

1117
01:20:12.415 --> 01:20:13.917
So what happens if I say no?

1118
01:20:15.126 --> 01:20:15.960
Nothing.

1119
01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:19.089
You don't have to do anything further.

1120
01:20:19.631 --> 01:20:21.091
Signature in a document.

1121
01:20:23.593 --> 01:20:25.470
I think you should only subject yourself

1122
01:20:25.553 --> 01:20:28.598
to this particular situation
if you have any remorse,


1123
01:20:28.681 --> 01:20:30.850
or want any kind of forgiveness.

1124
01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:04.300
I gotta earn.

1125
01:21:04.384 --> 01:21:05.218
Okay.

1126
01:21:07.637 --> 01:21:09.222
I won't bring it here.

1127
01:21:09.305 --> 01:21:10.140
Well, it's hard not to, init,

1128
01:21:10.223 --> 01:21:12.433
when you're using
the gaff as a storage facility.


1129
01:21:13.643 --> 01:21:15.395
We get spun, you're back in the dark.

1130
01:21:15.478 --> 01:21:16.396
We won't.

1131
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:19.440
Why don't you liven yourself up?

1132
01:21:20.024 --> 01:21:22.360
Hire yourself a lookout.
Use the shower stalls.


1133
01:21:22.443 --> 01:21:25.363
- Look, I know what I'm doing.
- I don't doubt that.


1134
01:21:27.031 --> 01:21:28.741
So, let me ask you,
who's giving you advice?


1135
01:21:28.825 --> 01:21:30.368
Someone who benefits.

1136
01:21:35.874 --> 01:21:36.791
An SO?

1137
01:21:43.631 --> 01:21:45.925
- Who told you?
- Well it's obvious, init?


1138
01:21:46.009 --> 01:21:47.135
SO.

1139
01:21:47.927 --> 01:21:49.012
Support Officer.

1140
01:21:49.721 --> 01:21:52.599
"There to correct of
or relating to the punishment of


1141
01:21:52.682 --> 01:21:56.686
criminals in a way intended
to rectify their behaviour."


1142
01:21:56.769 --> 01:21:57.812
I mean, nowhere.

1143
01:21:58.688 --> 01:22:01.441
Absolutely nowhere does it say
that they're there to help.


1144
01:22:01.524 --> 01:22:02.734
What? And you are?

1145
01:22:05.653 --> 01:22:07.280
You think they're on your side?

1146
01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:15.121
As soon as you miss a payment,
get caught, or get robbed,


1147
01:22:15.205 --> 01:22:17.707
they're gonna make sure you
say fuck-all to the higher-ups,


1148
01:22:17.790 --> 01:22:19.959
then they're gonna get
a sniff of it on the yard.


1149
01:22:20.043 --> 01:22:20.877
Then what?

1150
01:22:22.253 --> 01:22:24.380
- I'll work it out.
- You'll work it out.


1151
01:22:24.464 --> 01:22:26.799
Listen to yourself. 
Listen to yourself.

1152
01:22:26.883 --> 01:22:28.885
You're the geezer who just
turned fucking four years


1153
01:22:28.968 --> 01:22:30.428
into a ten-stretch.

1154
01:22:33.056 --> 01:22:35.642
Mark my words,
I'm telling you now, if you get caught


1155
01:22:35.725 --> 01:22:38.144
with a bit of fucking puff
or spice wrapped round ya,


1156
01:22:38.228 --> 01:22:39.979
they're gonna keep you in here,
behind doors,


1157
01:22:40.063 --> 01:22:42.440
well into your fucking 30s.
Now work that one out.


1158
01:22:42.523 --> 01:22:43.858
- Oh, what do you want, Steve?
- What do I want?


1159
01:22:43.942 --> 01:22:44.776
Yeah, what do you want?

1160
01:22:44.859 --> 01:22:45.777
I'll tell you what I fucking want.

1161
01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:48.821
I'm sitting here
and I'm looking at you and you look like


1162
01:22:48.905 --> 01:22:50.990
the geezer on the verge of
another fucking cell breakdown.


1163
01:22:52.325 --> 01:22:54.452
You think you're being extorted.

1164
01:22:54.535 --> 01:22:57.121
You're being fucking manipulated,
do you understand me?


1165
01:22:57.205 --> 01:22:58.873
And you're being taken for a mug.

1166
01:22:59.707 --> 01:23:02.627
A mug by inmates and screws.

1167
01:23:02.710 --> 01:23:04.003
Well, I can handle it.

1168
01:23:04.087 --> 01:23:04.921
Yeah, really?

1169
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.298
Yeah and I ain't no fucking mug.

1170
01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:09.550
You wanna fucking calm it down, son?

1171
01:23:09.634 --> 01:23:11.803
Don't start with the fucking mouth,
not in here.


1172
01:23:11.886 --> 01:23:14.013
Fuck off, man! 
What do you want?

1173
01:23:34.993 --> 01:23:36.411
Look, I'm sorry, man.

1174
01:23:38.121 --> 01:23:40.164
I'm really fucking sorry, bruv.

1175
01:24:24.167 --> 01:24:26.627
A lot of time and effort
has gone into this, Steve.


1176
01:24:26.711 --> 01:24:29.255
It benefits more than just you, you know.

1177
01:24:29.339 --> 01:24:30.631
And although the deciding factor

1178
01:24:30.715 --> 01:24:32.592
does indeed lie with yourself,

1179
01:24:32.675 --> 01:24:34.969
these kinds of opportunities are rare.

1180
01:24:35.386 --> 01:24:37.805
Any form of future decrees

1181
01:24:37.889 --> 01:24:39.891
will be presented in a firmer manner.

1182
01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:49.067
You should try and make this easier,

1183
01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:51.903
'cause you have many changes
coming up to contend with.


1184
01:24:54.655 --> 01:24:55.948
We'll be transferring Mr. Wainwright

1185
01:24:56.032 --> 01:24:57.700
into a different wing on Tuesday.

1186
01:25:02.163 --> 01:25:03.539
They'll kill him.

1187
01:25:03.623 --> 01:25:05.041
It's his choice. Not ours.

1188
01:25:06.626 --> 01:25:09.504
Like I said,
many things for you to get used to.


1189
01:25:09.587 --> 01:25:11.339
Taking your mind off it might help.

1190
01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:15.510
I expect to see you groomed
and ready to go tomorrow AM.


1191
01:25:15.593 --> 01:25:17.720
We'll make it as delicate as possible.

1192
01:25:17.804 --> 01:25:20.264
But we need you to play
a part here, Steve.


1193
01:25:20.348 --> 01:25:21.682
It'll be far more comfortable for us all.

1194
01:25:21.766 --> 01:25:24.268
I mean, what happened
about this being my choice?


1195
01:25:27.271 --> 01:25:28.981
You gave up those
rights a long time ago.


1196
01:25:29.065 --> 01:25:31.651
We let you have certain
ones up until a point.


1197
01:25:34.112 --> 01:25:35.279
And that point is here.

1198
01:26:33.504 --> 01:26:34.589
I heard you're leaving.

1199
01:26:37.008 --> 01:26:37.842
Yeah.

1200
01:26:41.512 --> 01:26:42.346
Everything all right?

1201
01:26:43.931 --> 01:26:45.141
Yeah, I just...

1202
01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:48.227
I just feel like I need
to hold myself, Steve.


1203
01:26:48.311 --> 01:26:49.520
- You know what I mean?
- And can ya?


1204
01:26:52.231 --> 01:26:53.274
Yeah.

1205
01:26:54.484 --> 01:26:57.028
If you say you're there,
well, then you're there.


1206
01:26:58.321 --> 01:26:59.280
Yeah.

1207
01:27:00.615 --> 01:27:02.116
They're getting me out of the wing.

1208
01:27:03.034 --> 01:27:05.369
You know?
Give me a chance to start afresh.


1209
01:27:06.078 --> 01:27:07.205
Lace up straight off.

1210
01:27:07.371 --> 01:27:08.873
They're gonna be coming at you.

1211
01:27:10.666 --> 01:27:11.626
Yeah.

1212
01:27:13.085 --> 01:27:13.920
I know.

1213
01:27:15.671 --> 01:27:17.632
At least I can
see it coming this time.

1214
01:27:19.592 --> 01:27:20.843
Part of the process, right?

1215
01:27:22.929 --> 01:27:25.681
I've taken my hours
and lumps in this place.


1216
01:27:27.099 --> 01:27:28.476
I'm not scared anymore, man.

1217
01:27:30.811 --> 01:27:32.730
But at least it keeps
it from coming in here.


1218
01:27:32.813 --> 01:27:34.315
You know, gives you some calm.

1219
01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.236
So when you leaving? 
They said Tuesday.

1220
01:27:39.612 --> 01:27:41.447
Yeah but I'm trying to keep it quiet.

1221
01:27:41.531 --> 01:27:44.116
I don't wanna give anyone
the chance to have a one-up on me.


1222
01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:47.161
Well, you know, you might get lucky.
You never know.


1223
01:27:47.245 --> 01:27:50.081
Get yourself a single,
shit when you want, do what you want,


1224
01:27:50.164 --> 01:27:53.084
and get yourself a lovely, sexy SO,
y'know what I'm sayin'?


1225
01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:55.211
Start fucking,
start on gunning, son.


1226
01:27:56.504 --> 01:27:58.464
Aww, I need it, man. I need it.

1227
01:28:02.885 --> 01:28:03.803
You tried, man.

1228
01:28:06.973 --> 01:28:07.974
I know you tried.

1229
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:16.816
So what about you?
You gonna see your daughter?


1230
01:28:20.444 --> 01:28:22.238
Surely you can get
out if you wanted to.

1231
01:28:22.822 --> 01:28:23.656
Yeah.

1232
01:28:25.449 --> 01:28:26.617
There's always a way.

1233
01:30:20.689 --> 01:30:22.858
One of us has to start the conversation.

1234
01:30:32.743 --> 01:30:34.578
Am I gonna have to carry this through?

1235
01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:41.168
You look younger than your pictures.

1236
01:30:41.252 --> 01:30:42.628
I look like my mom.

1237
01:30:43.462 --> 01:30:44.296
Yeah.

1238
01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:50.302
So where's your gran?

1239
01:30:50.386 --> 01:30:52.430
I decided to do this on me own.

1240
01:30:53.639 --> 01:30:55.015
They're outside.

1241
01:30:55.099 --> 01:30:56.308
There if I need.

1242
01:31:04.567 --> 01:31:07.319
I heard that you don't
speak to your mom anymore.


1243
01:31:09.947 --> 01:31:10.948
It's a shame.

1244
01:31:12.616 --> 01:31:13.909
'Cause she's a sweetheart.

1245
01:31:26.797 --> 01:31:28.757
You look younger than I thought, too.

1246
01:31:29.216 --> 01:31:30.468
Look like my mom.

1247
01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:39.810
I thought I'd lose it.

1248
01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:43.564
I thought if I met you,

1249
01:31:43.647 --> 01:31:45.441
I wouldn't be able to keep it together.

1250
01:31:49.778 --> 01:31:51.864
It's funny to see you in the flesh.

1251
01:31:55.701 --> 01:31:57.953
Makes me realise how
human you are in a way.


1252
01:32:02.041 --> 01:32:03.918
I wanted to see what that looked like.

1253
01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:09.798
Because I've been told for years that

1254
01:32:10.633 --> 01:32:12.718
you were just a troubled soul, but...

1255
01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:17.598
I couldn't get me head around
that because I came from you.


1256
01:32:20.601 --> 01:32:22.019
From your troubled soul.

1257
01:32:30.819 --> 01:32:32.571
I promised myself that
this wouldn't be a meeting


1258
01:32:32.655 --> 01:32:34.698
of two strangers who sit in silence.

1259
01:32:37.117 --> 01:32:39.036
I wanted to go straight in, head first,

1260
01:32:39.119 --> 01:32:41.622
and see what was I made from.

1261
01:32:45.417 --> 01:32:47.628
So is there anything
that you want to ask me?


1262
01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:07.606
How many times did you think
about calling this off?


1263
01:33:09.942 --> 01:33:10.776
And meeting me.

1264
01:33:12.528 --> 01:33:13.904
Do you mind if I roll up?

1265
01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:29.670
'Cause I thought about it loads.

1266
01:33:31.088 --> 01:33:32.881
Everyone kept asking me
why I'd wanna meet you


1267
01:33:32.965 --> 01:33:35.843
and my answer changed each time,
but I guess the real truth


1268
01:33:35.926 --> 01:33:37.720
was that I wanted to see your eyes.

1269
01:33:38.804 --> 01:33:40.931
The ones you can
barely lift to look at me.


1270
01:33:43.934 --> 01:33:45.728
You don't owe me anything, you know.

1271
01:33:47.521 --> 01:33:49.064
I'm not here for your sake.

1272
01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:51.942
For your discomfort.

1273
01:34:07.791 --> 01:34:09.918
- Then why are ya?
- 'Cause you're my dad.


1274
01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:12.838
And neither of us can run from that.

1275
01:34:14.089 --> 01:34:17.176
That's the simple truth. We are blood.

1276
01:34:18.177 --> 01:34:19.428
And I've sat with that.

1277
01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:22.264
I've sat with that knowledge

1278
01:34:22.348 --> 01:34:24.475
and every time
I've felt anger swell inside,


1279
01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:26.477
I'm acutely aware of where I came from,

1280
01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.062
but you know what the thing is?

1281
01:34:28.771 --> 01:34:30.481
The thing that I've come to learn.

1282
01:34:31.940 --> 01:34:33.942
I did come from you, Steve.

1283
01:34:35.402 --> 01:34:38.197
I came from this animal

1284
01:34:39.448 --> 01:34:42.785
that fuelled such anger
and hatred and violence


1285
01:34:42.868 --> 01:34:44.370
and what I know is this.

1286
01:34:45.371 --> 01:34:46.664
I am beautiful.

1287
01:34:49.041 --> 01:34:51.627
I am a kind, caring, beautiful woman,

1288
01:34:51.710 --> 01:34:54.129
and if I'm part you,
that shows me that somewhere


1289
01:34:54.213 --> 01:34:58.092
inside this horrifically
violent, angry person,


1290
01:34:58.175 --> 01:35:02.888
is a man who is capable of
bringing in good into this world.


1291
01:35:06.684 --> 01:35:08.602
Look, I'm sorry that
you did what you did,

1292
01:35:10.813 --> 01:35:13.190
and I'm sorry that your path
has led you here to this place


1293
01:35:13.273 --> 01:35:15.442
that feels so real to you.

1294
01:35:17.069 --> 01:35:18.112
So normal.

1295
01:35:19.488 --> 01:35:20.489
So home.

1296
01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:26.662
But I'm also grateful

1297
01:35:27.621 --> 01:35:29.039
that I was brought into this world,

1298
01:35:29.123 --> 01:35:31.083
however warped the circumstances.

1299
01:35:36.296 --> 01:35:37.631
I won't be a victim.

1300
01:35:41.385 --> 01:35:42.803
'Cause I can look into my child's eyes

1301
01:35:42.886 --> 01:35:44.805
and know that I've done okay.

1302
01:35:53.605 --> 01:35:54.815
I loved your mom.

1303
01:35:58.694 --> 01:36:00.279
And I doubt if you would've known that.

1304
01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:05.868
And you were brought into
this world within that love.


1305
01:36:10.706 --> 01:36:12.291
But if you're not here for my apology,

1306
01:36:12.374 --> 01:36:15.377
then the sad fact from me is
that's all I've got to offer you.


1307
01:36:18.881 --> 01:36:20.174
I'm not a good father.

1308
01:36:22.050 --> 01:36:23.302
And I'm not a good man.

1309
01:36:25.387 --> 01:36:28.348
I don't know how
to be a good man.

1310
01:36:31.602 --> 01:36:32.436
But I'm glad.

1311
01:36:35.522 --> 01:36:37.274
I'm glad you realise your beauty.

1312
01:36:39.610 --> 01:36:40.652
And your light.

1313
01:36:43.739 --> 01:36:45.157
And I'll take solace in that.

1314
01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:48.494
Knowing that I done something right,

1315
01:36:49.661 --> 01:36:50.954
even without my knowledge.

1316
01:36:55.334 --> 01:36:57.252
But I won't lie to you, because...

1317
01:36:59.254 --> 01:37:01.173
I have been nervous about meeting you.

1318
01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:04.760
And I don't usually get nerves.

1319
01:37:05.552 --> 01:37:06.428
It's new to me.

1320
01:37:08.514 --> 01:37:12.226
And trust me,
I can make eye contact all day long.


1321
01:37:13.727 --> 01:37:15.479
I don't know what good that's gonna do.

1322
01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:19.900
'Cause you're gonna walk out that door,

1323
01:37:20.859 --> 01:37:22.277
and you're gonna feel relief,

1324
01:37:24.071 --> 01:37:25.948
or sadness, or happiness.

1325
01:37:26.031 --> 01:37:26.990
I don't know.

1326
01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:30.327
But eventually, all that's gonna do

1327
01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:32.996
is just lead to more and more questions.

1328
01:37:35.249 --> 01:37:37.835
And then I don't want you
to see into that dark place


1329
01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:41.630
that I know you'll see.

1330
01:37:49.555 --> 01:37:52.099
Because all I can do
is give you false hope.


1331
01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:02.901
And I'll be back in my world.

1332
01:38:04.862 --> 01:38:06.905
And my duty to you will be done.

1333
01:40:34.426 --> 01:40:39.426
