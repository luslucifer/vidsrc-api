1
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:39.643
First time in Croatia?

2
00:01:39.726 --> 00:01:41.768
- Yeah.
- This is the old city.


3
00:01:43.726 --> 00:01:44.893
It's beautiful.

4
00:02:05.226 --> 00:02:06.226
We're here.

5
00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:22.643
Uh, in case you need a taxi
while you're here.


6
00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:25.560
Oh. Thank you, Zain.

7
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:28.560
- Enjoy,
- Wait, I need to pay you.


8
00:02:28.643 --> 00:02:30.310
Uh, it's been taken care of.

9
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.435
Oh, well, at least
let me tip you then.

10
00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:34.935
Please.

11
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:36.685
Thank you.

12
00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:40.643
You made it!

13
00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:43.643
Aw, it's so good to see you.

14
00:02:43.726 --> 00:02:45.185
You too.

15
00:02:45.268 --> 00:02:46.893
Look at you.

16
00:02:46.976 --> 00:02:49.226
I can't believe we're finally here.
We're doing this.


17
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.685
I know. Come on.
I've been waiting to open the duty-free.


18
00:02:51.768 --> 00:02:53.643
Yeah. Oh, you waited. 
That's a first.

19
00:02:56.518 --> 00:02:58.101
Airbnb deluxe.

20
00:02:58.935 --> 00:02:59.976
Hey, uh...

21
00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.935
Thanks for paying for the taxi.

22
00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:05.393
Thank Jay. It's all on him.

23
00:03:07.851 --> 00:03:10.810
Wow! Kate, this is incredible.

24
00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:14.143
Can we move in? Stay forever?

25
00:03:15.643 --> 00:03:16.893
- Okay.
- Whoo-hoo!


26
00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:18.456
That's it.

27
00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:20.643
Never going home. 
Think Rob would notice?

28
00:03:20.726 --> 00:03:22.393
Probably. But who cares?

29
00:03:22.476 --> 00:03:25.185
- Hope you brought your swimsuit.
- Oh, uh...


30
00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:28.685
- I think I forgot.
- Well, you'll just have to go naked.


31
00:03:33.393 --> 00:03:34.226
Here you go.

32
00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:37.536
Whoo!

33
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.351
Ooh, fancy.

34
00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:41.643
Dom Pérignon.

35
00:03:42.143 --> 00:03:43.143
Okay.

36
00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:47.643
- Finally!
- Yeah.


37
00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:48.935
To weekends away.

38
00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:50.810
With best friends.

39
00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:54.976
Oh.

40
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.601
I got you something.

41
00:03:58.101 --> 00:04:00.461
- You didn't have to get me anything.
- I wanted to, though.


42
00:04:00.518 --> 00:04:02.976
I just wanted to say thank you
for planning this whole thing.


43
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.393
And I've... I've really missed you so much.

44
00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:08.893
It's beautiful, Beth. Thank you.

45
00:04:11.226 --> 00:04:13.351
Here. I know you love black onyx.

46
00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:18.351
Oh!

47
00:04:18.435 --> 00:04:19.935
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

48
00:04:20.018 --> 00:04:21.518
Where is it?

49
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.351
I... I got it online.

50
00:04:24.435 --> 00:04:26.810
- I can send it back.
- No. No.


51
00:04:27.685 --> 00:04:28.685
I love it.

52
00:04:29.393 --> 00:04:30.393
I love you.

53
00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:31.726
I love you too.

54
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:38.351
Ugh.

55
00:04:39.143 --> 00:04:41.810
I don't know what to wear.
Nothing fancy enough.


56
00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:44.452
<i>So just go in your granny panties.
You'll still look great.</i>


57
00:04:45.435 --> 00:04:47.768
I'm so tired. I just
want to go to bed.

58
00:04:47.851 --> 00:04:49.685
<i>So go to bed. 
It's your holiday too.</i>

59
00:04:49.768 --> 00:04:52.518
No, no. Kate booked a restaurant.
It'll be fun.


60
00:04:52.601 --> 00:04:54.185
Tell me more about Aster.

61
00:04:54.268 --> 00:04:55.976
Are you missing mommy?

62
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.601
<i>Are you missing mommy?</i>

63
00:04:57.685 --> 00:04:59.393
<i>- Mama.
- Yeah.</i>


64
00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:03.685
<i>She misses your boobs, she says.</i>

65
00:05:04.851 --> 00:05:06.518
<i>So do I.</i>

66
00:05:08.393 --> 00:05:09.851
It'll have to do.

67
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.685
Here I come.

68
00:05:12.435 --> 00:05:13.560
Ta-da!

69
00:05:13.643 --> 00:05:15.185
Wow, Kate!

70
00:05:15.268 --> 00:05:17.518
What do you think? New dress.

71
00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:21.226
I went on the post-breakup shopping spree
to end all shopping sprees.


72
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.268
You look amazing.

73
00:05:23.351 --> 00:05:26.185
Oh, hey, Rob. How's it going?

74
00:05:26.268 --> 00:05:27.185
<i>Good.</i>

75
00:05:27.268 --> 00:05:29.976
Oh, is that my gorgeous goddaughter?

76
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.685
Aw. Hi.

77
00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:33.851
- Give her a kiss from me.
<i>- I will.</i>


78
00:05:33.935 --> 00:05:36.643
<i>I've got to put her down actually.
You guys have a good night.</i>


79
00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:38.685
<i>- Don't get too drunk.</i>
- We will.


80
00:05:38.768 --> 00:05:40.768
- And we will.
- We definitely will.


81
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.685
Night, sweetie. I love you.

82
00:05:44.768 --> 00:05:47.036
- I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.
<i>- Have a good time. Love you.</i>


83
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.143
I'm half wasted already.

84
00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:50.768
You're such a lightweight.

85
00:05:50.851 --> 00:05:53.851
Ah, if I break my neck
in these things, it's your fault.


86
00:05:53.935 --> 00:05:56.351
You look like a supermodel.
You should keep them.


87
00:05:56.435 --> 00:05:58.355
- They'll look great at the supermarket.
- Hello.


88
00:05:58.435 --> 00:05:59.435
- Hi.
- Hi.


89
00:05:59.976 --> 00:06:01.601
Oh. This is, um...

90
00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:04.018
Sebastian.

91
00:06:04.893 --> 00:06:06.476
- The owner.
- Oh.


92
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.893
- Have you settled in okay?
- Yeah. Hi, I'm Beth.


93
00:06:08.976 --> 00:06:10.452
It's nice to meet you.

94
00:06:10.476 --> 00:06:11.601
Everything's great.

95
00:06:11.685 --> 00:06:13.476
Come on. Taxi's here.

96
00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.560
Bye.

97
00:06:19.768 --> 00:06:21.101
Do you know what you want?

98
00:06:21.185 --> 00:06:23.226
I don't know,
but I need to eat soon.


99
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.518
Yeah, you do.

100
00:06:27.393 --> 00:06:28.768
Let's get oysters.

101
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:31.018
Jesus, are they gold-plated?

102
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:32.935
I keep telling you it's on Jay.

103
00:06:33.435 --> 00:06:35.195
He still hasn't
taken me off his credit card.


104
00:06:35.268 --> 00:06:37.628
I intend on discovering
what the limit is before he notices.


105
00:06:37.685 --> 00:06:38.768
Won't he be mad?

106
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.851
With any luck, he'll have an aneurysm
and drop dead on top of his assistant.


107
00:06:44.476 --> 00:06:46.018
So, uh, have we decided?

108
00:06:47.018 --> 00:06:48.018
Hello.

109
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.185
Uh, we'll start with a dozen raw oysters
and a bottle of champagne.


110
00:06:52.268 --> 00:06:55.393
- The most expensive one on the menu.
- Excellent.


111
00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.976
Mmm...

112
00:06:59.726 --> 00:07:01.935
No?

113
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:05.810
What?

114
00:07:06.226 --> 00:07:07.685
I've been a crap friend.

115
00:07:08.976 --> 00:07:10.851
I should've been there for you.

116
00:07:13.518 --> 00:07:15.435
You had a baby. 
You're forgiven.

117
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.560
Are you okay?

118
00:07:21.393 --> 00:07:22.393
Yeah.

119
00:07:23.435 --> 00:07:26.060
I'm fine. Couldn't care less about Jay.

120
00:07:27.768 --> 00:07:31.143
- And what about polyamory, girl? Ooh!
- Polyamory, huh?


121
00:07:31.685 --> 00:07:33.935
I can barely manage one relationship.

122
00:07:34.518 --> 00:07:36.893
Who's talking about relationship?

123
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:41.226
Anyway, enough about me. 
How about you?

124
00:07:43.351 --> 00:07:44.643
How's things with Rob?

125
00:07:47.851 --> 00:07:48.851
Good.

126
00:07:49.768 --> 00:07:51.143
They're rea... They're good.

127
00:07:52.976 --> 00:07:54.685
He's really great with Aster.

128
00:07:55.393 --> 00:07:57.143
Mmm, and what about with you?

129
00:07:57.851 --> 00:07:58.851
Uh...

130
00:08:00.268 --> 00:08:01.268
He's trying.

131
00:08:01.893 --> 00:08:03.143
How hard is he trying?

132
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.226
Are you getting any at least?

133
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:07.685
Kate.

134
00:08:07.768 --> 00:08:08.768
What?

135
00:08:09.435 --> 00:08:10.685
How long has it been?

136
00:08:11.268 --> 00:08:12.435
Um...

137
00:08:13.601 --> 00:08:14.518
Over a year.

138
00:08:17.268 --> 00:08:18.643
Wow. Oh.

139
00:08:18.726 --> 00:08:19.726
Um...

140
00:08:20.685 --> 00:08:22.935
Isn't it about time
you got back on the horse?


141
00:08:23.976 --> 00:08:26.393
I... I just don't feel like it.

142
00:08:26.476 --> 00:08:27.351
Is it Rob?

143
00:08:27.435 --> 00:08:29.744
- Is he not doing it for you anymore?
- It's not Rob.


144
00:08:29.768 --> 00:08:30.851
A body never lies.

145
00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:32.643
No, no, it's me.

146
00:08:32.726 --> 00:08:33.726
It's...

147
00:08:34.268 --> 00:08:35.268
It's, uh...

148
00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:37.851
- Have you thought about leaving him?
- What?


149
00:08:37.935 --> 00:08:42.351
If you're not happy,
take it from me, divorce is the answer.


150
00:08:42.435 --> 00:08:44.685
Especially when it comes
with a big fat alimony paycheck.


151
00:08:44.768 --> 00:08:47.393
We're just going through...

152
00:08:47.476 --> 00:08:48.476
...a rough patch.

153
00:08:49.226 --> 00:08:50.643
You've said that before.

154
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:00.590
- Beth...
- Here we are.


155
00:09:01.476 --> 00:09:02.935
- One for you.
- Thank you.


156
00:09:05.518 --> 00:09:07.185
Excuse me, may I?

157
00:09:07.268 --> 00:09:08.851
Yes. Thank you.

158
00:09:09.351 --> 00:09:11.393
- Thanks a lot.
- Not a problem.


159
00:09:11.976 --> 00:09:13.935
You're such an asshole.

160
00:09:14.018 --> 00:09:16.976
Shut up. Go away. Go away.

161
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.518
I'm afraid the card was rejected.

162
00:09:20.976 --> 00:09:22.726
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.


163
00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:23.810
Okay.

164
00:09:24.643 --> 00:09:26.810
- Oh, wow.
- Stop calling me.


165
00:09:26.893 --> 00:09:28.768
- One minute and, uh...
- Of course.


166
00:09:28.851 --> 00:09:29.851
Bye.

167
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:37.060
Everything okay?

168
00:09:38.351 --> 00:09:40.601
- Jay.
- Did he find out about the card?


169
00:09:41.185 --> 00:09:43.768
Yeah. Turns out I did discover the limit.

170
00:09:46.518 --> 00:09:47.518
Oh!

171
00:09:47.601 --> 00:09:49.435
Do you want me to go halves?

172
00:09:49.518 --> 00:09:50.810
No. No, no, no.

173
00:09:51.601 --> 00:09:55.268
- You get the drinks at the next place.
- Kate, I'm so sorry. I'm tired.


174
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:57.577
- And my boobs are like gonna explode.
- No, no, no.


175
00:09:57.601 --> 00:09:59.476
I have to pump. 
They're full, and I can't.

176
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.768
- And we have the bike tour tomorrow.
- Oh, yeah, the bike tour.


177
00:10:04.226 --> 00:10:05.726
Oh, come on.

178
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.143
Let's relive our misspent youth.

179
00:10:08.768 --> 00:10:11.185
It took me months
to convince you to come away.


180
00:10:11.268 --> 00:10:13.018
Who knows when we're
going to do it again.

181
00:10:14.935 --> 00:10:16.060
Come on.

182
00:10:25.518 --> 00:10:26.351
Uh...

183
00:10:26.435 --> 00:10:28.893
The entrance is just around there.

184
00:10:30.393 --> 00:10:32.310
Uh, thank you, Zain.

185
00:10:32.393 --> 00:10:35.768
Oh, wait, wait, wait. I just want to fix
my face and powder my nose.


186
00:10:38.101 --> 00:10:40.310
- Uh, are you from here?
- No.


187
00:10:40.393 --> 00:10:41.685
Syrian.

188
00:10:41.768 --> 00:10:42.768
American?

189
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:43.976
Uh, yeah.

190
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:48.393
California originally, but I've lived
in London the last 15 years.


191
00:10:48.893 --> 00:10:51.101
You left Syria because of the war.

192
00:10:51.768 --> 00:10:52.768
Hm.

193
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.101
Do you miss home?

194
00:10:56.893 --> 00:10:58.161
Oh, you speak Arabic?

195
00:10:58.185 --> 00:11:01.601
No, not, not very well.
Um, just a little bit.


196
00:11:01.685 --> 00:11:05.101
I work with the Global Rescue Initiative,
or I used to.


197
00:11:05.185 --> 00:11:06.226
I know them.

198
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.810
Cool.

199
00:11:09.726 --> 00:11:11.310
Okay. I'm ready. Let's go.

200
00:11:11.393 --> 00:11:13.143
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.


201
00:11:17.893 --> 00:11:18.893
Okay.

202
00:11:20.351 --> 00:11:21.351
Yeah.

203
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.560
What do you want?

204
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.060
Oh, just water.

205
00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:33.643
Let me get these.

206
00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:36.393
- No, no, you get the next round.
- What can I get you?


207
00:11:36.476 --> 00:11:37.893
Two gin and tonics.

208
00:11:41.726 --> 00:11:44.393
Oh my God, look over there. Hot.

209
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.560
- Here you go.
- We should go over there.


210
00:11:48.435 --> 00:11:49.643
- Follow me.
- Okay.


211
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.351
Coming through.

212
00:11:56.101 --> 00:12:00.518
- Mind if we join you?
- No, I'm sure they're waiting for someone.


213
00:12:00.601 --> 00:12:02.601
No, no, please, be our guests.

214
00:12:04.393 --> 00:12:05.393
- Hello.
- Hi.


215
00:12:05.476 --> 00:12:06.796
- Beth. Hi.
- Hey, beauty.


216
00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.060
Yeah. Oh.

217
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.726
Oh.

218
00:12:10.351 --> 00:12:11.351
Oh.

219
00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:14.601
I don't think I've seen you here before.

220
00:12:14.685 --> 00:12:16.185
I would have noticed you.

221
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.435
I love your dress.
You look like a disco ball.


222
00:12:24.476 --> 00:12:26.185
You want to see pictures of my baby?

223
00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.643
When was the last time
you got hit on by someone that hot?


224
00:12:38.726 --> 00:12:40.310
He's not hitting on me.

225
00:12:40.393 --> 00:12:41.518
Yeah, he is.

226
00:12:44.476 --> 00:12:47.685
Come on, we were just saying
you need to get back on the horse.


227
00:12:47.768 --> 00:12:49.226
I... I'm married.

228
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.810
So? Rob doesn't have to find out.

229
00:12:51.893 --> 00:12:53.143
Are you joking?

230
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.101
One night of excitement
might bring you out of your rut.


231
00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.476
Manhattan for the lady.

232
00:13:06.351 --> 00:13:07.351
Thank you.

233
00:13:15.351 --> 00:13:18.143
We were just saying
how you should come back to ours.


234
00:13:25.393 --> 00:13:27.101
Bitch!

235
00:14:33.726 --> 00:14:34.726
Kate.

236
00:15:03.518 --> 00:15:07.351
<i>Hi, you've got Kate,
or maybe you haven't, so leave a message.</i>


237
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:12.840
Hey, did you get my text?

238
00:15:12.893 --> 00:15:15.143
- What? No. Sorry.
<i>- I'm really worried.</i>


239
00:15:15.226 --> 00:15:17.060
<i>It's already noon,
and Kate hasn't come home.</i>


240
00:15:17.143 --> 00:15:18.018
Okay.

241
00:15:18.101 --> 00:15:21.393
<i>So she's probably gone for a coffee
or a wander or something.</i>


242
00:15:21.476 --> 00:15:23.435
<i>- Did you have a good night?
-</i>Yeah.


243
00:15:25.351 --> 00:15:26.435
I did. I drank a bit much.

244
00:15:26.518 --> 00:15:28.935
<i>Honestly, I can barely remember anything.</i>

245
00:15:29.018 --> 00:15:31.101
Right. And what are you doing today?

246
00:15:31.185 --> 00:15:32.685
We're meant to be doing a bike tour.

247
00:15:32.768 --> 00:15:36.685
There you go. That's why she's vanished.
Should've told her it was a shopping tour.


248
00:15:36.768 --> 00:15:40.018
She... She didn't leave a note,
and she hasn't texted either.


249
00:15:40.601 --> 00:15:41.851
<i>Did you have an argument?</i>

250
00:15:46.101 --> 00:15:47.643
- Bitch!
- No.


251
00:15:47.726 --> 00:15:50.560
<i>Then don't hang around waiting.</i>

252
00:15:50.643 --> 00:15:52.060
<i>Get out. Enjoy yourself.</i>

253
00:15:52.726 --> 00:15:54.601
<i>- I'll speak to you later. Yeah?
-</i>Okay.


254
00:15:55.476 --> 00:15:58.185
- I'll let you know if I hear. Love you.
<i>- Bye.</i>


255
00:16:05.393 --> 00:16:06.476
- Hi.
- Hi.


256
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.393
I'm sorry to bother you. Uh...

257
00:16:09.018 --> 00:16:10.226
Have you see my friend?

258
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:12.351
I'm looking for her. Um, Kate.

259
00:16:12.435 --> 00:16:15.560
I think she went out,
and I can't get a hold of her.


260
00:16:15.643 --> 00:16:17.435
She's not answering her phone.

261
00:16:18.768 --> 00:16:20.810
You haven't seen her, have you?

262
00:16:20.893 --> 00:16:21.893
No.

263
00:16:23.143 --> 00:16:24.976
Okay. Thank you.

264
00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:30.060
You're not allowed to have parties.
It says so very clearly in the rules.


265
00:16:32.018 --> 00:16:35.643
And I have to charge you
for the two extra guests that stayed over.


266
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.393
<i>What was the name of the bar?</i>

267
00:16:41.476 --> 00:16:42.851
<i>I can't remember the name.</i>

268
00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:44.601
Okay, let me see her photo.

269
00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:55.685
So you brought two men back
to your apartment.


270
00:16:56.226 --> 00:16:58.685
- And you don't remember their names.
- Well...


271
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.393
No, I don't...

272
00:17:01.476 --> 00:17:04.518
- Had you been drinking?
- Yeah, a little.


273
00:17:04.601 --> 00:17:07.060
More than a little
if you don't remember anything.


274
00:17:07.143 --> 00:17:09.643
I'm... I'm just not used to drinking,
that's all.


275
00:17:09.726 --> 00:17:13.101
I... I just had a baby. So...

276
00:17:13.185 --> 00:17:17.393
Okay, your friend
probably go out clubbing or to a bar.


277
00:17:18.393 --> 00:17:20.518
No, uh, we're here together.

278
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:23.601
So we're supposed to be doing things,
sightseeing and...


279
00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:26.476
She's not answering her phone.

280
00:17:28.185 --> 00:17:29.310
I think I found blood.

281
00:17:34.435 --> 00:17:37.351
Did you check the hospitals?
Maybe she had an accident.


282
00:17:37.435 --> 00:17:40.768
Yeah. I did, but there's no record
of her being admitted.


283
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:42.976
Is everything okay?

284
00:17:43.726 --> 00:17:45.726
Yeah. Some tourist.

285
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:50.435
Her friend ditched her
for some guy, and she's upset.


286
00:17:50.518 --> 00:17:53.935
Does she have her bag
with her? Her wallet, her passport, keys?


287
00:17:54.018 --> 00:17:55.560
Yes. I checked.

288
00:17:55.643 --> 00:17:57.476
I can handle it.

289
00:18:03.226 --> 00:18:05.146
Can I file
a missing persons report?


290
00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:08.810
No, you can't
because you need to wait 24 hours.


291
00:18:08.893 --> 00:18:10.810
Most people show up before then.

292
00:18:12.185 --> 00:18:13.768
I'm sure your friend will too.

293
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:27.810
<i>Hello.</i>

294
00:18:27.851 --> 00:18:28.851
Zain.

295
00:18:36.935 --> 00:18:40.143
- Thanks for picking me up.
- It was close by. It's no bother.


296
00:18:40.226 --> 00:18:42.726
I couldn't remember the name
of the bar last night.


297
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:44.476
The Blue Parlour.

298
00:18:50.185 --> 00:18:51.185
That's it.

299
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:52.726
Has something happened?

300
00:18:54.351 --> 00:18:55.851
Did you lose something?

301
00:18:57.893 --> 00:18:58.893
My friend.

302
00:19:17.185 --> 00:19:18.185
Uh, no need.

303
00:19:18.893 --> 00:19:21.143
- You want me to come in with you?
- No.


304
00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:22.226
Sure?

305
00:19:22.768 --> 00:19:23.851
Yeah, it's okay.

306
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.060
Thank you.

307
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.101
<i>You served us.</i>

308
00:19:30.185 --> 00:19:33.060
We were sitting right there with two guys.

309
00:19:33.143 --> 00:19:34.810
She was wearing a blue dress.

310
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.018
No, no. Sorry. No.

311
00:19:38.768 --> 00:19:39.851
What are you doing?

312
00:19:39.935 --> 00:19:41.685
Figured you could use some help.

313
00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.685
Escorts? As in...

314
00:19:59.601 --> 00:20:02.351
I didn't know
that was an actual, real thing?


315
00:20:03.726 --> 00:20:04.893
I didn't hire them.

316
00:20:04.976 --> 00:20:07.018
Then your friend must have.

317
00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:09.060
No, she didn't hire them either.

318
00:20:10.268 --> 00:20:12.643
One night of excitement

319
00:20:12.726 --> 00:20:14.685
might bring you out of your rut.

320
00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:19.810
Oh my God.

321
00:20:20.726 --> 00:20:23.976
She kept going on and on
about how I needed to have some fun.


322
00:20:25.851 --> 00:20:26.935
I'm such an idiot.

323
00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:29.560
I wondered why he was into me.

324
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.435
The barman says
he's seen them there a lot.


325
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.185
Always with different woman.

326
00:20:35.268 --> 00:20:36.351
Tourists.

327
00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:38.018
They joke about it.

328
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.810
Does he know
how to get a hold of them?


329
00:20:42.393 --> 00:20:44.810
Uh, he only knew their first names.

330
00:20:45.685 --> 00:20:46.810
Mateo and Luka.

331
00:20:47.685 --> 00:20:49.351
Come on. I'll take you back.

332
00:20:53.935 --> 00:20:55.415
<i>You went to the police?</i>

333
00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:59.185
<i>I mean, this is Kate we're talking about.
She's not exactly reliable.</i>


334
00:20:59.268 --> 00:21:02.685
<i>No, no, she wouldn't do this to me.
Leave without telling me?</i>


335
00:21:02.768 --> 00:21:03.601
<i>Really?</i>

336
00:21:03.685 --> 00:21:06.768
How many times on a night out did
she ditch you for a bloke she just met?


337
00:21:06.851 --> 00:21:08.768
<i>No,
I've left her dozens of messages.</i>


338
00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:10.768
<i>- Something's happened to her.</i>
- Don't be silly.


339
00:21:12.018 --> 00:21:15.310
<i>I've got some brilliant pictures
to show you of Aster by the way.</i>


340
00:21:15.393 --> 00:21:18.185
<i>Earlier on, we were watching</i>
The Godfather,<i>and it turns out</i>


341
00:21:18.268 --> 00:21:21.393
she really likes the part where they find
the horse's head in the bed.


342
00:21:21.476 --> 00:21:22.893
<i>Great parenting.</i>

343
00:21:25.185 --> 00:21:26.185
I miss her.

344
00:21:26.643 --> 00:21:27.643
<i>Are you okay?</i>

345
00:21:28.101 --> 00:21:29.101
Mm-hmm.

346
00:21:29.935 --> 00:21:31.226
<i>Well, we're seeing you tomorrow.</i>

347
00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:33.566
<i>Do you need me
to pick you up from the airport?</i>


348
00:21:33.643 --> 00:21:34.643
Oh my God.

349
00:21:35.518 --> 00:21:37.518
I can't believe
it's nearly Sunday already.


350
00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:39.393
<i>- I'll have to change my flight.</i>
- You can't.


351
00:21:39.476 --> 00:21:40.685
<i>I've got work on Monday.</i>

352
00:21:40.768 --> 00:21:43.310
<i>- What about Aster?</i>
- You don't think I want to come home, Rob?


353
00:21:43.393 --> 00:21:44.726
But Kate's vanished!

354
00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:48.060
<i>Yeah.</i>

355
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:51.268
<i>Yeah. God, of course. 
Yeah, sorry.</i>

356
00:21:51.351 --> 00:21:54.101
<i>- Do... Do you need me to come over?
-</i>No, It's okay.


357
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.060
I'll be fine.

358
00:21:56.476 --> 00:21:57.476
<i>Okay.</i>

359
00:21:58.268 --> 00:21:59.976
<i>All right. Just call
if you need me, yeah?</i>

360
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.893
- Okay. Good night.
<i>- Good night.</i>


361
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:19.060
<i>Bitch!</i>

362
00:22:54.685 --> 00:22:55.685
Zain.

363
00:22:56.435 --> 00:22:57.726
I think I found them.

364
00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.518
<i>I called and said I wanted
to hire them for a private party.</i>


365
00:23:03.268 --> 00:23:04.768
They're meeting us here.

366
00:23:04.851 --> 00:23:08.143
What if they don't know anything,
or what if they won't tell us?


367
00:23:09.143 --> 00:23:12.518
- Maybe we should go to the police.
- No, I'll handle it.


368
00:23:12.601 --> 00:23:13.601
Don't worry.

369
00:23:18.185 --> 00:23:19.726
How'd you two meet?

370
00:23:20.268 --> 00:23:21.476
Kate and me?

371
00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:23.601
Uh...

372
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:26.976
I was on a semester abroad.

373
00:23:28.185 --> 00:23:29.310
We were roommates.

374
00:23:30.101 --> 00:23:32.101
I met my husband Rob through her.

375
00:23:34.226 --> 00:23:35.768
We hit it off straight away.

376
00:23:36.268 --> 00:23:37.643
You and your husband.

377
00:23:37.726 --> 00:23:39.768
No, me and Kate, actually.

378
00:23:41.226 --> 00:23:43.393
We were total opposites,

379
00:23:43.476 --> 00:23:46.060
but just clicked.

380
00:23:46.143 --> 00:23:49.226
You know, right away, she's an extrovert.

381
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:52.101
- My wife calls it <i>Carneebeh.
- Carneebeh.</i>


382
00:23:52.185 --> 00:23:53.268
- Yeah.
- What is that?


383
00:23:53.351 --> 00:23:54.726
<i>Carneebeh.</i>It's...

384
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.476
She likes to play games.

385
00:23:59.935 --> 00:24:00.851
<i>Carneebeh.</i>

386
00:24:00.935 --> 00:24:02.393
How did you meet your wife?

387
00:24:04.101 --> 00:24:05.101
Mina.

388
00:24:06.018 --> 00:24:10.143
She was a doctor at the hospital
where I was doing my nursing training?


389
00:24:10.893 --> 00:24:11.893
She's like you,

390
00:24:12.518 --> 00:24:14.435
very trusting of people.

391
00:24:15.018 --> 00:24:17.185
She believed me
when I say I was a nice guy


392
00:24:17.268 --> 00:24:19.310
and agreed to go out with me.

393
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.143
Is Mina okay with you helping me?

394
00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.060
She's dead.

395
00:24:36.976 --> 00:24:38.351
I'm so sorry.

396
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:41.810
Hey.

397
00:24:42.143 --> 00:24:43.643
Don't worry. I got this.

398
00:24:44.435 --> 00:24:46.226
Hi. Hel...

399
00:24:47.601 --> 00:24:48.601
Hey!

400
00:24:50.726 --> 00:24:52.226
- I'm sorry!
- Heh!


401
00:24:55.643 --> 00:24:57.226
Go!

402
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.994
- Where is she?
- What?


403
00:25:30.018 --> 00:25:31.643
- Where is she?
- Where's who?


404
00:25:31.726 --> 00:25:34.893
- The woman you were with Friday night.
- Kate! What have you done with her?


405
00:25:34.976 --> 00:25:37.560
- I have done nothing.
- So why did you run just now?


406
00:25:37.643 --> 00:25:40.327
- She hired us for a good time. That's all.
- Don't lie to me!


407
00:25:46.976 --> 00:25:48.952
- What's he saying?
- They took her handbag?


408
00:25:48.976 --> 00:25:50.518
When was the last time you saw her?

409
00:25:52.643 --> 00:25:53.851
3:00 a.m.

410
00:25:53.935 --> 00:25:55.643
What'd you do with the bag? Answer!

411
00:25:58.143 --> 00:25:59.393
They pawned it.

412
00:26:02.393 --> 00:26:04.685
Wait. Did you drug me?

413
00:26:05.226 --> 00:26:06.986
Did you put something
in my water at the bar?


414
00:26:07.018 --> 00:26:08.810
- Answer!
- No!


415
00:26:09.768 --> 00:26:12.768
I don't need to drug women.
Come on. Please let me go. Okay?


416
00:26:12.851 --> 00:26:14.226
Don't tell the police, please.

417
00:26:15.893 --> 00:26:17.685
Please, I'll get you the bag.
Okay? Please.


418
00:26:17.768 --> 00:26:18.976
<i>I'll take you there.</i>

419
00:26:27.226 --> 00:26:28.226
They're hers.

420
00:26:30.935 --> 00:26:31.935
It's dead.

421
00:26:33.601 --> 00:26:35.643
I didn't know
they were stolen!


422
00:26:40.143 --> 00:26:43.303
- You think you were drugged?
- I've never been that drunk before?


423
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:46.351
They got me a glass of water.
They could've slipped something into it.


424
00:26:46.435 --> 00:26:49.185
What if they drugged Kate too,
you know? So they could rob us.


425
00:26:49.268 --> 00:26:51.435
Why didn't they take your bag too?

426
00:26:52.851 --> 00:26:53.851
Maybe Kate drugged you.

427
00:26:57.351 --> 00:26:58.685
Why would she do that?

428
00:27:00.268 --> 00:27:02.726
Well, she did hire them
to have sex with you.


429
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.935
No, no. She would never hurt me.

430
00:27:06.018 --> 00:27:07.726
I know they know more.

431
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:11.601
Um...

432
00:27:12.643 --> 00:27:14.393
Maybe don't mention my name.

433
00:27:15.226 --> 00:27:16.810
I don't want to get in trouble.

434
00:27:17.935 --> 00:27:21.060
If they revoke my visa,
I have no place else to go.


435
00:27:21.143 --> 00:27:22.143
I get it.

436
00:27:22.935 --> 00:27:25.768
Listen, I'm sorry
for dragging you into all this.


437
00:27:25.851 --> 00:27:28.226
You're not dragging me into anything.

438
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:29.643
Stop saying sorry.

439
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:31.893
Call me if you need me, okay?

440
00:27:57.268 --> 00:27:58.768
Well, I couldn't wait.

441
00:27:58.851 --> 00:28:02.101
And look, now I have proof.
Something must have happened to her.


442
00:28:02.185 --> 00:28:04.369
Let's not jump to conclusions.
Let's start with details.


443
00:28:04.393 --> 00:28:08.768
- Your friend's name, date of birth...
- No, I gave this to him already yesterday.


444
00:28:08.851 --> 00:28:10.185
You were there.

445
00:28:10.268 --> 00:28:11.476
Where's the report?

446
00:28:14.018 --> 00:28:15.018
Uh...

447
00:28:16.143 --> 00:28:19.060
- You didn't file it?
- He told me to come back in 24 hours.


448
00:28:19.143 --> 00:28:21.476
I figured her friend was out partying.

449
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.018
They brought two escorts back
to their apartment.


450
00:28:24.101 --> 00:28:26.226
They were drunk. 
Probably high on drugs.

451
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:30.768
No, I... I wasn't doing drugs.
And... I didn't know they were escorts.


452
00:28:33.185 --> 00:28:35.810
Something bad has happened to her.

453
00:28:36.351 --> 00:28:37.435
I know it.

454
00:28:37.518 --> 00:28:39.685
<i>I don't think
they're serial killers, Beth.</i>


455
00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:43.601
And even if they are,
I don't know if I care. Look at them.


456
00:28:44.518 --> 00:28:46.435
You need to interview these men.

457
00:28:47.268 --> 00:28:48.268
I think...

458
00:28:49.935 --> 00:28:53.351
they might have drugged me
or maybe both of us.


459
00:28:53.435 --> 00:28:55.268
You just said you didn't do drugs.

460
00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:58.226
I... I didn't do drugs. 
I was drugged.

461
00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.976
- There's a difference.
- Funny you didn't mention it before.


462
00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:04.018
'Cause I wasn't sure. 
I'm still not.

463
00:29:04.101 --> 00:29:05.851
Can you get her some water?

464
00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:09.601
Then run these names through the system.

465
00:29:22.268 --> 00:29:24.393
I'm sorry about my colleague.

466
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.060
I need to ask,

467
00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.935
is it possible
you may have been assaulted?


468
00:29:42.976 --> 00:29:46.601
Well, when we're done here,
we'll take you to the hospital


469
00:29:46.685 --> 00:29:48.935
for a drug test and a checkup.

470
00:29:50.393 --> 00:29:51.393
Okay.

471
00:29:54.810 --> 00:29:56.060
This is a real Dior.

472
00:29:56.935 --> 00:29:58.101
It's worth around

473
00:29:58.851 --> 00:30:00.018
10,000 Euro.

474
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:03.726
And they admitted they stole it,

475
00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.185
and then gave it back to you.

476
00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:10.476
I, eh...

477
00:30:11.393 --> 00:30:13.560
I explained Kate was missing, and I...

478
00:30:14.601 --> 00:30:18.268
told them I wouldn't go
to the police if they gave it back to me.


479
00:30:21.601 --> 00:30:22.601
Hm.

480
00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:28.101
Any signs of sexual assault
are still inconclusive.


481
00:30:28.185 --> 00:30:31.685
We'll have those results and the results
of the blood test within 24 hours.


482
00:30:38.351 --> 00:30:39.935
What do you mean, Jay?

483
00:30:40.018 --> 00:30:41.978
<i>- It's a classic Kate move.</i>
- Going missing?


484
00:30:42.018 --> 00:30:44.060
Always has to be the center of attention.

485
00:30:44.143 --> 00:30:46.060
She wore red on
our wedding day, I mean,

486
00:30:46.143 --> 00:30:48.726
should've taken that as a warning
of sharks in the water.


487
00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.560
You haven't talked to her then?

488
00:30:50.643 --> 00:30:52.851
<i>No, not for weeks. 
It's been bliss.</i>

489
00:30:53.601 --> 00:30:56.435
- No, no, you talked to her Friday night.
- No, I didn't.


490
00:30:56.518 --> 00:30:58.560
She said you called her
about the credit card.


491
00:30:58.643 --> 00:31:01.476
What credit card? All communication
has to go through our lawyers.


492
00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.060
Look, Beth, I can actually guarantee
this whole disappearance act


493
00:31:05.143 --> 00:31:06.643
is a lot of bollocks, all right.

494
00:31:06.726 --> 00:31:07.851
What credit card by the way?

495
00:31:07.935 --> 00:31:12.101
What? Are you saying
she's... faking her disappearance?


496
00:31:12.185 --> 00:31:14.143
Why? Why would she do that?

497
00:31:14.226 --> 00:31:18.810
Because drama is embedded
in her DNA like an extra chromosome.


498
00:31:19.851 --> 00:31:22.935
She once ran off to New York
for a week after we had an argument


499
00:31:23.018 --> 00:31:24.935
with no word if
she was dead or alive.

500
00:31:25.018 --> 00:31:27.851
All right, just trust me,
she likes to punish people.


501
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.268
<i>Look, I gotta go. Just call me,
and let me know what happens, all right?</i>


502
00:31:58.101 --> 00:31:59.101
Kate?

503
00:32:03.351 --> 00:32:05.643
- What are you doing?
- Checkout is 11:00.


504
00:32:05.726 --> 00:32:06.726
Oh.

505
00:32:07.476 --> 00:32:09.101
I'm sorry, I forgot.

506
00:32:09.185 --> 00:32:11.018
There are other guests arriving.

507
00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:13.101
I'll do it.

508
00:32:15.185 --> 00:32:16.185
I'll do it.

509
00:32:19.976 --> 00:32:22.143
- Your friend is still missing.
- Yeah.


510
00:32:23.518 --> 00:32:26.185
- Did you go to the police?
- Yeah, they're looking for her.


511
00:32:26.976 --> 00:32:28.560
I'm staying till they find her.

512
00:32:30.435 --> 00:32:31.851
Where?

513
00:32:32.726 --> 00:32:33.851
I'll find a hotel.

514
00:32:35.018 --> 00:32:36.476
I have a spare room.

515
00:32:37.435 --> 00:32:38.435
Downstairs.

516
00:32:39.518 --> 00:32:40.976
<i>I rent it sometimes.</i>

517
00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.060
<i>I'll give you a discount.</i>

518
00:32:44.935 --> 00:32:47.393
If your friend shows up,
at least you will be close by.


519
00:32:52.018 --> 00:32:53.018
Okay.

520
00:33:00.768 --> 00:33:02.060
You're down here.

521
00:33:24.685 --> 00:33:25.685
Mm-hm.

522
00:33:30.476 --> 00:33:33.226
Uh, there should be towels
in the bathroom, and...


523
00:33:34.143 --> 00:33:36.435
just let me know
if you need anything else.


524
00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:40.226
Thanks.

525
00:33:42.435 --> 00:33:43.893
I think you're gonna love it.

526
00:34:13.976 --> 00:34:16.893
<i>You've reached Rob,
leave me a message after the...</i>


527
00:34:42.851 --> 00:34:43.851
Beth.

528
00:35:58.601 --> 00:36:00.726
You helped yourself.

529
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:06.310
Uh...

530
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:09.226
Yeah. Is that okay?

531
00:36:10.726 --> 00:36:11.810
Of course.

532
00:36:14.185 --> 00:36:16.393
Is that your recording studio?

533
00:36:16.976 --> 00:36:17.976
Yes.

534
00:36:18.935 --> 00:36:20.351
I'm a composer.

535
00:36:21.226 --> 00:36:22.268
Are you hungry?

536
00:36:23.226 --> 00:36:24.851
I was about to order in.

537
00:36:26.476 --> 00:36:27.518
Uh...

538
00:36:28.935 --> 00:36:32.226
Uh, I... I was
about to go out actually.

539
00:36:35.476 --> 00:36:36.476
Good night.

540
00:36:42.268 --> 00:36:43.685
Hi. Thanks.

541
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:45.893
I had to get out of there.

542
00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.560
Have you eaten?

543
00:36:48.893 --> 00:36:50.976
Let's get some food
before we start looking.


544
00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.060
- I know a very good Syrian...
- Beth.


545
00:36:54.685 --> 00:36:55.685
Rob?

546
00:36:57.226 --> 00:36:59.018
Uh, what are you doing here?

547
00:36:59.101 --> 00:37:01.601
I've been calling you all day
to let you know I was on my way.


548
00:37:01.685 --> 00:37:03.518
- I was worried about you.
- Where's Aster?


549
00:37:03.601 --> 00:37:05.518
- She's with a babysitter.
- Overnight?


550
00:37:05.601 --> 00:37:09.060
My parents are away.
Remember? In the Dordogne. She'll be fine.


551
00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:12.518
- Sorry, am I interrupting something?
- No. This is Zain.


552
00:37:12.601 --> 00:37:15.810
He's a taxi driver.
And he's been helping me look for Kate.


553
00:37:16.393 --> 00:37:17.601
Nice to meet you.

554
00:37:18.518 --> 00:37:19.518
You too.

555
00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:23.393
- Okay, I'll... I'll go.
- Okay.


556
00:37:23.476 --> 00:37:25.310
Let me know if you hear anything.

557
00:37:25.393 --> 00:37:27.560
- I will. Thanks. Sorry.
- Bye.


558
00:37:27.643 --> 00:37:28.643
Bye.

559
00:37:31.185 --> 00:37:33.351
Who the bloody hell is he?

560
00:37:34.018 --> 00:37:37.036
- I just told you. He's the taxi driver.
- Who you were going to dinner with.


561
00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.685
Give me a break. 
He's been helping me.

562
00:37:38.768 --> 00:37:43.310
He... He drove me and Kate to a bar
the night that she went missing...


563
00:37:43.393 --> 00:37:45.643
Beth, are you kidding?
What if he's involved?


564
00:37:45.726 --> 00:37:47.310
No.

565
00:37:47.393 --> 00:37:49.233
You were just about
to get into a car with him.


566
00:37:49.268 --> 00:37:51.476
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, I'm not.


567
00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.643
Jesus, Beth.

568
00:38:01.268 --> 00:38:02.268
Hey.

569
00:38:03.351 --> 00:38:04.351
Come here.

570
00:38:05.185 --> 00:38:07.185
I'm sorry.

571
00:38:07.268 --> 00:38:08.601
I am sorry, all right?

572
00:38:11.643 --> 00:38:13.393
I didn't mean to upset you.

573
00:38:13.476 --> 00:38:15.851
Why didn't you tell me?
I would've flown straight over.


574
00:38:15.935 --> 00:38:17.327
I couldn't tell you over the phone.

575
00:38:17.351 --> 00:38:18.351
Escorts?

576
00:38:20.185 --> 00:38:21.185
She hired them?

577
00:38:23.518 --> 00:38:26.060
Do the police think
they're involved in her going missing?


578
00:38:26.143 --> 00:38:27.435
They don't seem to have a clue.

579
00:38:27.518 --> 00:38:29.398
And they're barely lifting a finger
to find her.


580
00:38:29.476 --> 00:38:31.601
What if Jay's right,
and she's messing with us?


581
00:38:31.685 --> 00:38:33.518
No. I know Kate. She'd...

582
00:38:34.226 --> 00:38:38.060
She likes to be the center of attention,
yes, but she wouldn't do this to me.


583
00:38:43.851 --> 00:38:44.851
Hello.

584
00:38:50.685 --> 00:38:52.726
<i>She's been in the water
for some time.</i>


585
00:38:56.893 --> 00:38:57.893
Oh.

586
00:39:00.935 --> 00:39:01.935
It's her.

587
00:39:01.976 --> 00:39:03.268
Oh my God!

588
00:39:13.685 --> 00:39:14.685
She drowned?

589
00:39:15.726 --> 00:39:18.560
It's too soon to say.
The autopsy will tell us more.


590
00:39:18.643 --> 00:39:21.935
- But you think it was an accident?
- That she fell in?


591
00:39:26.768 --> 00:39:28.643
Or do you think she was killed?

592
00:39:29.768 --> 00:39:31.893
We need to wait
for the result of the autopsy.


593
00:39:33.143 --> 00:39:34.976
We'll be in touch when we know more.

594
00:40:04.768 --> 00:40:05.893
What are you doing?

595
00:40:10.935 --> 00:40:11.935
Couldn't sleep.

596
00:40:13.435 --> 00:40:14.601
I keep seeing her

597
00:40:16.226 --> 00:40:17.726
lying there on that slab.

598
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.685
I feel bad, you know,
for finding her annoying.


599
00:40:26.351 --> 00:40:27.726
I should've been nicer.

600
00:40:44.893 --> 00:40:47.452
I have to get going soon.
You sure you don't want to come with me?


601
00:40:47.476 --> 00:40:49.268
We talked about this. I have to...

602
00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:52.810
stay till after the autopsy and...

603
00:40:54.435 --> 00:40:57.935
- There's the arrangements to figure out.
- Yeah. Sorry. Sorry.


604
00:40:58.435 --> 00:40:59.726
I know. You're right.

605
00:41:24.393 --> 00:41:25.893
Is the coroner certain?

606
00:41:27.476 --> 00:41:28.560
Yes.

607
00:41:30.268 --> 00:41:31.810
It's now a murder inquiry.

608
00:41:32.476 --> 00:41:36.143
They can't tell if she was sexually
assaulted given the state of the body.


609
00:41:37.685 --> 00:41:40.435
And the fact
she had sex with multiple partners


610
00:41:40.518 --> 00:41:42.185
on the night she went missing.

611
00:41:54.018 --> 00:41:55.101
Can I see her?

612
00:41:57.893 --> 00:41:59.226
I want to say goodbye.

613
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.560
Properly.

614
00:42:19.351 --> 00:42:21.351
Can I have a minute? Please?

615
00:42:47.268 --> 00:42:48.268
We need to go.

616
00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:04.351
I... I have to...

617
00:43:36.685 --> 00:43:39.976
<i>You've reached Rob,
leave me a message after the tone.</i>


618
00:44:31.393 --> 00:44:33.476
- Everything okay?
- Yes.


619
00:44:41.018 --> 00:44:42.685
- You ready?
- Mm-mm.


620
00:44:42.768 --> 00:44:43.935
Kovac is waiting.

621
00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:46.810
Screen's broken.

622
00:44:53.976 --> 00:44:56.018
<i>The toxicology report came back.</i>

623
00:44:56.101 --> 00:44:59.560
It shows high levels
of cocaine and ketamine in Kate's system.


624
00:45:00.851 --> 00:45:02.601
Did you know she was taking drugs?

625
00:45:03.518 --> 00:45:04.518
Yes.

626
00:45:05.601 --> 00:45:06.893
Why didn't you tell us?

627
00:45:06.976 --> 00:45:09.351
You'd already made a judgment
about who she was.


628
00:45:09.435 --> 00:45:12.643
I thought it would stop you looking
for her, and it did.


629
00:45:13.893 --> 00:45:14.893
Didn't it?

630
00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:24.310
The results of your blood work
came back too.


631
00:45:24.393 --> 00:45:25.935
They also found traces of ketamine.

632
00:45:26.018 --> 00:45:28.351
See. I... I told you I was drugged.

633
00:45:28.435 --> 00:45:30.935
We interviewed
the two men you identified.


634
00:45:31.018 --> 00:45:33.310
They deny giving you
any illegal substances.


635
00:45:33.393 --> 00:45:35.518
Well, they would. 
Wouldn't they?

636
00:45:35.601 --> 00:45:37.393
Well, they've got no priors.

637
00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:40.685
And they also have alibis
for the time of the murder.


638
00:45:40.768 --> 00:45:43.185
A taxi driver
picked them up outside your apartment.


639
00:45:43.268 --> 00:45:45.185
Their roommate can vouch for them too.

640
00:45:45.268 --> 00:45:46.393
Bad luck.

641
00:45:48.893 --> 00:45:51.226
What about Jay?

642
00:45:52.018 --> 00:45:53.560
It's Kate's ex-husband.

643
00:45:54.393 --> 00:45:56.518
She's divorcing him. 
Isn't that a motive?

644
00:45:56.601 --> 00:45:57.518
He's in London.

645
00:45:57.601 --> 00:45:59.361
It's only a two-hour flight
from here.


646
00:45:59.435 --> 00:46:00.601
We'll look into it.

647
00:46:01.851 --> 00:46:03.810
We interviewed people
from the Blue Parlour,


648
00:46:03.893 --> 00:46:06.601
and several people saw you
and Kate arguing when you left.


649
00:46:06.685 --> 00:46:07.935
What? No.

650
00:46:08.643 --> 00:46:09.643
That's not true.

651
00:46:09.685 --> 00:46:13.143
You didn't argue with Kate then,
hours before she died?


652
00:46:15.643 --> 00:46:17.893
<i>They're complete strangers!</i>

653
00:46:17.976 --> 00:46:20.018
Relax! It'll be an adventure!

654
00:46:21.976 --> 00:46:23.310
It wasn't an argument.

655
00:46:23.976 --> 00:46:25.310
It was a conversation.

656
00:46:25.935 --> 00:46:28.351
I thought you didn't recall anything
about that night.


657
00:46:28.435 --> 00:46:30.036
- You were drugged, remember?
- No.


658
00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:33.435
I... I passed out in the taxi,
but I remember some things.


659
00:46:33.518 --> 00:46:35.226
Your story keeps changing.

660
00:46:37.018 --> 00:46:38.226
What are you saying?

661
00:46:39.518 --> 00:46:42.185
You think I have something
to do with Kate's murder?


662
00:46:44.351 --> 00:46:46.601
Is there anything else
you haven't told us?


663
00:46:55.226 --> 00:46:56.226
No.

664
00:47:01.226 --> 00:47:04.560
We need your passport
until we can verify your statement.


665
00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:11.976
If you remember anything, call me.

666
00:47:19.935 --> 00:47:22.185
Let's hope your story checks out.

667
00:47:30.101 --> 00:47:31.476
Jay, you knew.

668
00:47:32.143 --> 00:47:32.976
Didn't you?

669
00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:34.476
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

670
00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:39.851
Look, I was going to,
but, uh, you were about to have a baby.


671
00:47:39.935 --> 00:47:43.101
My husband
was having an affair with my best friend,


672
00:47:43.185 --> 00:47:45.393
and you didn't think
I had the right to know.


673
00:47:45.476 --> 00:47:46.518
Look, Beth...

674
00:47:47.685 --> 00:47:49.768
How long was it going on for?

675
00:47:50.851 --> 00:47:51.851
Not long.

676
00:47:53.768 --> 00:47:55.226
Uh... a few months.

677
00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.226
<i>I guess she was trying to get back at me.
Tit for Tat.</i>


678
00:47:58.310 --> 00:47:59.310
Wow.

679
00:48:00.351 --> 00:48:01.351
Wow.

680
00:48:02.226 --> 00:48:03.976
You know they had a thing at Uni.

681
00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:07.018
Yeah, yeah, a drunken one-night stand
at freshman week.


682
00:48:07.101 --> 00:48:09.261
- What are you saying?
<i>- I'm not saying anything.</i>


683
00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:10.393
<i>It's just, you know,</i>

684
00:48:10.476 --> 00:48:12.768
maybe there
were some latent feelings on her part.


685
00:48:18.143 --> 00:48:20.351
How could I have not seen it?

686
00:48:22.351 --> 00:48:24.685
We don't see what
we don't want to see.

687
00:48:27.976 --> 00:48:30.643
I've been feeling so guilty for...

688
00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:33.351
for being...

689
00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:36.310
so unhappy.

690
00:48:37.893 --> 00:48:40.351
Like I'm not grateful enough

691
00:48:41.101 --> 00:48:44.560
for my life, for Aster.

692
00:48:46.101 --> 00:48:48.601
I was just too ashamed

693
00:48:49.393 --> 00:48:52.476
to look up and see what
was staring me in the face.


694
00:48:57.351 --> 00:48:58.351
Oh my God.

695
00:49:02.185 --> 00:49:03.851
What if she did drug me

696
00:49:04.476 --> 00:49:06.976
so I would sleep with someone

697
00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:10.726
or not know if I had or hadn't?

698
00:49:11.726 --> 00:49:14.351
Then she could get Rob to leave me.

699
00:49:16.518 --> 00:49:18.476
Do you think he could have killed Kate?

700
00:49:19.601 --> 00:49:20.601
Rob?

701
00:49:21.768 --> 00:49:24.018
Oh, God, no.

702
00:49:24.518 --> 00:49:26.685
And I spoke to him over the weekend.

703
00:49:26.768 --> 00:49:29.060
He was home with Aster.

704
00:49:31.185 --> 00:49:33.351
You never wondered if it was me?

705
00:49:34.893 --> 00:49:35.893
No.

706
00:49:37.893 --> 00:49:39.101
Too trusting, right?

707
00:49:41.893 --> 00:49:43.518
One thing I've learned,

708
00:49:44.476 --> 00:49:45.935
never trust people,

709
00:49:46.768 --> 00:49:48.101
only your instincts.

710
00:49:50.143 --> 00:49:54.226
Where I come from,
we say <i>Alalbek Daleelek.</i>


711
00:49:56.018 --> 00:49:57.518
Your heart is your guide.

712
00:50:03.685 --> 00:50:04.685
Zain.

713
00:50:05.018 --> 00:50:06.018
How did...

714
00:50:08.935 --> 00:50:11.518
How did your wife die?

715
00:50:17.476 --> 00:50:19.143
She was working in a clinic.

716
00:50:21.851 --> 00:50:23.393
There was a bombing. Uh...

717
00:50:29.185 --> 00:50:30.726
I was late to pick her up.

718
00:50:44.726 --> 00:50:45.935
It's not your fault.

719
00:51:11.851 --> 00:51:13.351
<i>You there? Hello? Hi?</i>

720
00:51:14.018 --> 00:51:17.685
<i>Hey, um, I was putting Aster down.
Sorry, I got your message. You okay?</i>


721
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:20.976
I know, Rob.

722
00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:22.393
Know? Know what?

723
00:51:23.476 --> 00:51:24.601
<i>About you and Kate.</i>

724
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:28.810
- What about me and Kate?
- Stop!


725
00:51:28.893 --> 00:51:30.810
Beth, what are you talking about?

726
00:51:30.893 --> 00:51:33.851
That you were sleeping
with her for months.


727
00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:39.810
Uh, what?
What you talking about?


728
00:51:39.893 --> 00:51:44.560
Stop treating me like an idiot.
I found the text messages on her phone.


729
00:51:51.685 --> 00:51:52.685
I... I...

730
00:51:53.351 --> 00:51:54.351
<i>I...</i>

731
00:51:56.226 --> 00:51:58.351
I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.

732
00:51:59.476 --> 00:52:00.476
I...

733
00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:02.143
It didn't mean anything.

734
00:52:02.726 --> 00:52:05.476
<i>I only did it because we...
When was the last time we had sex?</i>


735
00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:09.518
<i>- You were depressed and I...</i>
- No! You do not get to blame this on me.


736
00:52:09.601 --> 00:52:13.060
- No, I'm not blam... Look, I'm sorry...
<i>- Stop apologizing!</i>


737
00:52:14.685 --> 00:52:15.768
Did you love her?

738
00:52:17.351 --> 00:52:18.560
Of course I didn't...

739
00:52:19.435 --> 00:52:22.268
Look, you've just got to come home.
We can't do this over the phone.


740
00:52:22.351 --> 00:52:24.518
I can't come home, Rob,

741
00:52:24.601 --> 00:52:28.685
because the police have taken my passport
because I'm sure they think I killed Kate.


742
00:52:28.768 --> 00:52:32.143
And if they find out about the affair,
they'll have a damn good reason too.


743
00:52:34.685 --> 00:52:36.310
Beth, Beth, Beth, Beth.

744
00:52:36.393 --> 00:52:38.226
- I am so sorry.
<i>- Just shut up.</i>


745
00:52:39.101 --> 00:52:40.976
I just want to see Aster.

746
00:53:03.893 --> 00:53:07.143
Beth Jenner, we're arresting you on
suspicion of the murder of Kate Thompson.


747
00:53:07.643 --> 00:53:09.560
Put your hands behind your back.

748
00:53:09.643 --> 00:53:10.643
What?

749
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.643
For how long have you known Mr. Zakaria?

750
00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:18.560
Zain?

751
00:53:21.518 --> 00:53:22.518
A few days.

752
00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:25.351
Why?

753
00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:27.143
How did the two of you meet?

754
00:53:28.185 --> 00:53:29.560
He drives a taxi.

755
00:53:30.393 --> 00:53:32.768
He took me and Kate
to the bar on Friday night.


756
00:53:33.435 --> 00:53:35.018
He's been helping me look for her.

757
00:53:35.101 --> 00:53:37.869
Why didn't you tell us he was with you
when you confronted the escorts?


758
00:53:37.893 --> 00:53:40.310
Or that he physically
assaulted one of them?


759
00:53:40.393 --> 00:53:41.810
But they stole Kate's bag.

760
00:53:41.893 --> 00:53:44.560
He got them to admit it.
He got the bag back.


761
00:53:44.643 --> 00:53:48.143
Mr. Zakaria
is connected to organized crime.


762
00:53:48.226 --> 00:53:50.601
He's a member of an Albanian gang

763
00:53:50.685 --> 00:53:53.935
involved in human trafficking,
among other things.


764
00:53:56.601 --> 00:53:57.601
What?

765
00:53:57.685 --> 00:53:59.018
You didn't know this about him?

766
00:53:59.101 --> 00:54:03.226
No. No, of course not.
What... What are you saying?


767
00:54:03.310 --> 00:54:04.768
He killed Kate.

768
00:54:04.851 --> 00:54:06.143
- No! No!
- Yes!


769
00:54:06.226 --> 00:54:08.268
- He can't have.
- Yes. Yes.


770
00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:11.060
And you hired him to do it.

771
00:54:11.143 --> 00:54:12.976
- What?
- He's also been arrested.


772
00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:15.476
This is insane! This is insane!

773
00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:18.935
How do you... You can't possibly think
I had anything to do with this!


774
00:54:19.018 --> 00:54:21.268
Please! Why would I want Kate dead?

775
00:54:21.351 --> 00:54:23.810
Because she was having an affair
with your husband.


776
00:54:25.976 --> 00:54:27.018
Oh.

777
00:54:27.726 --> 00:54:29.268
You didn't think we'd find out.

778
00:54:29.351 --> 00:54:31.393
I only found out yesterday.

779
00:54:34.351 --> 00:54:36.560
Did you talk to Jay?

780
00:54:36.643 --> 00:54:38.643
Jay has known about it for months.

781
00:54:38.726 --> 00:54:41.101
We are speaking to him later today.

782
00:54:45.143 --> 00:54:47.060
I want a lawyer.

783
00:54:47.685 --> 00:54:49.143
Can I have a lawyer?

784
00:54:49.226 --> 00:54:52.685
Just because they haven't charged you
doesn't mean they won't.


785
00:54:52.768 --> 00:54:55.518
It is only because they don't
have enough evidence yet.


786
00:54:55.601 --> 00:54:59.226
They were hoping they could press you
on your connection to Mr. Zacharia,


787
00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:00.810
and you'd confess.

788
00:55:00.893 --> 00:55:02.351
To what?

789
00:55:02.435 --> 00:55:03.726
I didn't do anything.

790
00:55:07.851 --> 00:55:11.560
Call me next time before you say anything
to incriminate yourself.


791
00:55:38.018 --> 00:55:39.518
What are you doing here?

792
00:55:39.601 --> 00:55:41.101
Your landlord let me in.

793
00:55:41.851 --> 00:55:43.185
I needed to see you.

794
00:55:44.726 --> 00:55:46.685
They told me you'd been arrested.

795
00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.435
They let me go.

796
00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:53.226
I was driving all Friday night
until Saturday morning.


797
00:55:53.310 --> 00:55:55.101
The app tracks everything.

798
00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:56.810
They said...

799
00:55:58.226 --> 00:56:01.560
you have links
to an Albanian criminal gang.


800
00:56:04.101 --> 00:56:05.768
You think I killed Kate?

801
00:56:06.351 --> 00:56:07.435
I don't know.

802
00:56:07.518 --> 00:56:09.560
I don't know who to believe.

803
00:56:15.601 --> 00:56:19.435
I saved the life of a boy
who'd been hit with shrapnel in the leg.


804
00:56:19.518 --> 00:56:22.685
His father has connections
to an Albanian people-smuggling ring.


805
00:56:23.643 --> 00:56:27.685
He got me out of Aleppo,
crossed the border into Turkey then here.


806
00:56:27.768 --> 00:56:29.435
Helped secure me a visa.

807
00:56:31.810 --> 00:56:33.893
So you don't work for this person?

808
00:56:35.143 --> 00:56:36.143
No.

809
00:56:37.351 --> 00:56:39.768
How do I know
you're telling me the truth?

810
00:56:40.476 --> 00:56:43.268
Your heart is your guide.

811
00:56:58.268 --> 00:57:00.893
<i>You can't possibly think
I had anything to do with this.</i>


812
00:57:00.976 --> 00:57:02.268
<i>Why would I want Kate dead?</i>

813
00:57:02.351 --> 00:57:05.143
Because she was having an affair
with your husband.


814
00:57:29.726 --> 00:57:30.768
<i>So what?</i>

815
00:57:31.310 --> 00:57:34.143
My husband was having an affair
with my best friend.


816
00:57:34.226 --> 00:57:36.143
You didn't think I
had the right to know?

817
00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:57.476
Oh my God.

818
00:58:20.268 --> 00:58:21.268
Hello.

819
00:58:40.768 --> 00:58:42.560
Are you looking for something?

820
00:58:43.685 --> 00:58:44.851
Oh, uh...

821
00:58:45.601 --> 00:58:47.226
Uh, takeout menus.

822
00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:48.810
I'm hungry.

823
00:58:49.643 --> 00:58:51.143
All the menus are online.

824
00:58:51.768 --> 00:58:54.226
Uh, my cell data ran out.

825
00:58:55.893 --> 00:58:58.060
Could I get the Wi
-Fi password?

826
00:59:01.643 --> 00:59:02.851
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.


827
00:59:11.185 --> 00:59:14.101
What happened with the police?
They let you go.


828
00:59:15.393 --> 00:59:16.393
Yeah.

829
00:59:18.268 --> 00:59:21.060
And how much longer
do you think you'll be staying here?


830
00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:24.851
Um, I... I don't know.

831
00:59:24.935 --> 00:59:27.268
- Are you going out somewhere?
- Yes.


832
00:59:29.018 --> 00:59:32.643
A screening for a movie
I supervised the music for.


833
00:59:35.185 --> 00:59:36.185
Hmm.

834
00:59:36.768 --> 00:59:38.351
Goodbye, then.

835
01:00:31.143 --> 01:00:32.143
What?

836
01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:40.643
Oh my Jesus Christ.

837
01:00:45.268 --> 01:00:46.351
Oh my God.

838
01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:50.768
You're filming everything.

839
01:00:54.601 --> 01:00:56.185
Did you film Friday?

840
01:01:01.018 --> 01:01:02.393
Come on, come on, come on.

841
01:01:09.101 --> 01:01:11.101
<i>Whoa! Oh my God.</i>

842
01:01:11.185 --> 01:01:12.661
<i>Yeah, right?</i>

843
01:01:12.685 --> 01:01:15.935
<i>- Well, thanks. Are you sure?
- Yeah, no, for sure. Come on.</i>


844
01:01:17.435 --> 01:01:18.435
<i>Fine.</i>

845
01:01:25.643 --> 01:01:27.411
<i>- Here we go.
- Watch your step.</i>


846
01:01:27.435 --> 01:01:29.268
<i>I'm watching my step.</i>

847
01:01:29.351 --> 01:01:31.851
<i>Somebody's gonna have
a beautiful night of sleep.</i>


848
01:01:31.935 --> 01:01:32.976
<i>Beth.</i>

849
01:01:33.060 --> 01:01:34.893
<i>What happened to you?</i>

850
01:01:35.976 --> 01:01:38.351
<i>Let's get you ready for bed. Yeah. Whoa.</i>

851
01:01:54.976 --> 01:01:56.685
<i>Come on, join in.</i>

852
01:01:56.768 --> 01:01:57.768
<i>Whoo!</i>

853
01:01:58.476 --> 01:01:59.476
<i>Very good.</i>

854
01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:00.560
<i>Hot tub.</i>

855
01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:02.810
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

856
01:02:02.893 --> 01:02:04.893
<i>Hot tub on the balcony.</i>

857
01:02:05.685 --> 01:02:07.393
<i>Oh yeah, strip down.</i>

858
01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:11.435
<i>Whoo!</i>

859
01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:19.101
<i>Don't you go anywhere.</i>

860
01:02:19.185 --> 01:02:20.393
<i>Don't take too long.</i>

861
01:02:21.476 --> 01:02:22.560
<i>See you, beautiful.</i>

862
01:02:44.143 --> 01:02:45.560
<i>Son of a bitch!</i>

863
01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:47.393
<i>Bitch!</i>

864
01:02:53.226 --> 01:02:54.435
<i>Ahh!</i>

865
01:03:30.726 --> 01:03:32.310
Who's that with her?

866
01:03:54.893 --> 01:03:57.643
- No!
- No! Stop! It's not what you think!


867
01:03:57.726 --> 01:03:59.226
It's for security!

868
01:03:59.310 --> 01:04:00.518
People have parties!

869
01:04:00.601 --> 01:04:03.268
You're taping people
in the shower having sex!


870
01:04:03.351 --> 01:04:05.851
And you knew what happened to Kate
this whole time.


871
01:04:05.935 --> 01:04:07.476
You could have told the police.

872
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.310
You told them
about my husband's affair, didn't you?


873
01:04:10.393 --> 01:04:11.560
What are you doing?

874
01:04:11.643 --> 01:04:14.268
What is that? No. 
Don't delete them.

875
01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:15.768
It's evidence! No!

876
01:04:16.976 --> 01:04:17.976
Stop!

877
01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:19.935
Oh gosh.

878
01:04:45.518 --> 01:04:46.518
Oh!

879
01:04:54.643 --> 01:04:55.643
Help!

880
01:04:56.143 --> 01:04:57.268
Beth.

881
01:04:58.310 --> 01:04:59.685
Oh.

882
01:04:59.768 --> 01:05:01.518
- Wait!
- Let's go.


883
01:05:01.601 --> 01:05:02.768
What happened?

884
01:05:03.643 --> 01:05:06.810
Stop, you don't understand!
Stop. I can explain.


885
01:05:06.893 --> 01:05:08.452
Go! Now! Go!

886
01:05:08.476 --> 01:05:10.435
Beth! Come back! Come back!

887
01:05:10.518 --> 01:05:12.518
He... He deleted all the videos.

888
01:05:13.143 --> 01:05:15.310
He's gonna tell the police I attacked him.

889
01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:18.143
Oh my God, this is a nightmare.

890
01:05:18.935 --> 01:05:20.143
Listen.

891
01:05:20.226 --> 01:05:21.810
We'll find out where Kate went,

892
01:05:21.893 --> 01:05:24.185
then we can hopefully find out
who brought her home.


893
01:05:24.268 --> 01:05:27.393
Then we can go to the police.
We will explain. It will be okay.


894
01:05:27.476 --> 01:05:28.476
Trust me.

895
01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:39.643
I gave him the license number.

896
01:05:40.268 --> 01:05:41.810
Driver is on his way.

897
01:05:43.393 --> 01:05:44.393
Did I hurt you?

898
01:05:45.935 --> 01:05:47.101
You hurt your hand?

899
01:05:47.185 --> 01:05:48.185
A little.

900
01:05:49.101 --> 01:05:52.435
Throat, balls, eyes.

901
01:05:53.143 --> 01:05:54.185
Soft targets.

902
01:05:54.685 --> 01:05:57.101
Okay, I'll remember that for next time.

903
01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:01.601
What does that mean?

904
01:06:03.768 --> 01:06:06.018
They say you're a suspect
in Kate's murder.


905
01:06:09.601 --> 01:06:10.935
You speak English?

906
01:06:11.018 --> 01:06:12.018
Very little.

907
01:06:13.393 --> 01:06:17.226
You picked up a woman
early Saturday morning around 3:00.


908
01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:20.143
- She's my height, blonde hair.
- On Jerina Street.


909
01:06:23.143 --> 01:06:24.143
She's dead.

910
01:06:24.976 --> 01:06:25.976
She was murdered.

911
01:06:26.685 --> 01:06:28.935
Where did you take her?

912
01:06:30.143 --> 01:06:32.810
We just need
to know where you took her. That's all.


913
01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:36.935
She made me follow these two men.
She said they stole her bag.


914
01:06:37.018 --> 01:06:38.935
I lost them on a one-way street.

915
01:06:39.018 --> 01:06:41.060
What's he saying?
Where'd you take her?


916
01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:45.310
Where?

917
01:06:45.893 --> 01:06:47.060
The police station.

918
01:06:52.101 --> 01:06:53.101
Thank you.

919
01:06:55.351 --> 01:06:57.143
If Kate reported her bag stolen,

920
01:06:57.226 --> 01:06:59.577
why wasn't there a record of it
when I reported her missing?


921
01:06:59.601 --> 01:07:00.976
Maybe it never got filed.

922
01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.143
Pavic didn't file my report either.

923
01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.060
We need to get out of here.

924
01:07:24.101 --> 01:07:25.185
Come on!

925
01:07:25.768 --> 01:07:28.226
Beth! Don't leave!
We just want to talk.


926
01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:29.851
Stop!

927
01:07:37.726 --> 01:07:38.726
Beth!

928
01:07:39.226 --> 01:07:40.768
Stop! Right now!

929
01:07:54.185 --> 01:07:55.268
Stop it!

930
01:07:58.476 --> 01:07:59.476
Come on.

931
01:08:05.476 --> 01:08:06.518
Stop!

932
01:08:11.768 --> 01:08:12.768
His car.

933
01:08:13.268 --> 01:08:14.393
The cop's car.

934
01:08:14.476 --> 01:08:17.393
I saw the sticker in the security footage.

935
01:08:17.476 --> 01:08:20.351
He must've driven Kate home
after she reported her bag stolen.


936
01:08:20.435 --> 01:08:22.143
Why didn't he say anything?

937
01:08:24.435 --> 01:08:26.810
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

938
01:08:28.935 --> 01:08:31.518
It was him. It was him.

939
01:08:32.351 --> 01:08:33.351
It was Pavic.

940
01:08:34.685 --> 01:08:35.810
Call your lawyer.

941
01:08:35.893 --> 01:08:38.143
- Make her meet you.
- Wait. Where are you going?


942
01:08:38.226 --> 01:08:40.226
- Don't worry about me.
- No.


943
01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:41.393
You'll get in trouble.

944
01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.518
Go! Go! Go!

945
01:08:55.393 --> 01:08:56.513
It's him!

946
01:08:56.976 --> 01:08:58.736
Believe me it's him.
It's the cop who did it.


947
01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:01.244
- What're you talking about?
- We saw the footage.


948
01:09:01.268 --> 01:09:02.435
What do you mean?

949
01:09:16.393 --> 01:09:18.143
Where did she go?

950
01:09:38.518 --> 01:09:39.518
Stop!

951
01:09:40.518 --> 01:09:41.810
You're under arrest.

952
01:09:41.893 --> 01:09:43.060
It was you.

953
01:09:43.976 --> 01:09:45.601
You killed her.

954
01:09:45.685 --> 01:09:46.685
What?

955
01:09:47.476 --> 01:09:49.143
You hit on her, didn't you?

956
01:09:49.226 --> 01:09:50.310
Shut up.

957
01:09:50.393 --> 01:09:53.560
My God, you did!
You hit on her, and she rejected you!


958
01:09:53.643 --> 01:09:54.476
She was a slut!

959
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.851
That's what men call women
who won't sleep with them!


960
01:09:56.935 --> 01:09:59.101
- Shut your mouth! Shut up!
- No! No!


961
01:09:59.185 --> 01:10:00.768
Shut your mouth!

962
01:10:00.851 --> 01:10:02.768
Pavic, stop! Stop it!

963
01:10:38.893 --> 01:10:39.893
Hi.

964
01:10:40.685 --> 01:10:42.060
Sorry for the wait.

965
01:10:43.393 --> 01:10:44.601
How are you feeling?

966
01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.726
We found security footage.

967
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:52.393
A camera on the boardwalk.

968
01:10:52.476 --> 01:10:55.810
And we recovered
some of your landlord's footage.


969
01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.685
I'm so sorry I doubted you.
You were right.


970
01:10:59.768 --> 01:11:03.185
Pavic drove Kate home
after she reported her bag stolen.


971
01:11:03.768 --> 01:11:06.143
We think he did
make a pass at her.

972
01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.893
When she rejected him,

973
01:11:09.518 --> 01:11:10.851
he took it badly.

974
01:11:15.726 --> 01:11:17.893
So he... he killed her.

975
01:11:22.226 --> 01:11:24.310
Based on the autopsy results,

976
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:29.643
we can safely assume
Pavic hit her over the back of the head,


977
01:11:31.226 --> 01:11:33.476
and then dumped her body in the harbor

978
01:11:34.268 --> 01:11:35.935
while she was still alive.

979
01:11:37.435 --> 01:11:38.435
Why?

980
01:11:39.435 --> 01:11:40.435
I...

981
01:11:42.476 --> 01:11:43.935
I... I don't understand.

982
01:11:44.518 --> 01:11:46.768
Pavic used to work vice.

983
01:11:48.935 --> 01:11:50.101
Several women

984
01:11:51.185 --> 01:11:54.268
he arrested for sex work
claimed he assaulted them.


985
01:11:54.351 --> 01:11:56.226
Internal Affairs investigated it,

986
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:59.810
but the women
all withdrew their statements.


987
01:12:02.601 --> 01:12:04.268
We think he threatened them.

988
01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:05.601
IA couldn't fire him,

989
01:12:05.685 --> 01:12:09.560
so unfortunately, they moved him over
to the tourist division.


990
01:12:12.976 --> 01:12:14.685
She didn't deserve this.

991
01:12:16.643 --> 01:12:18.101
No.

992
01:12:18.643 --> 01:12:19.643
I...

993
01:12:20.226 --> 01:12:21.643
I ordered a search warrant

994
01:12:21.726 --> 01:12:24.518
on Luka and Mateo's apartment
and workplace too.


995
01:12:25.435 --> 01:12:26.518
We found ketamine.

996
01:12:26.601 --> 01:12:29.851
They've been drugging the women
who hired them then robbing them.


997
01:12:30.351 --> 01:12:32.018
They drugged Kate too,

998
01:12:32.101 --> 01:12:34.893
but the cocaine
in her system counteracted it.


999
01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:37.601
We are charging them.

1000
01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:42.560
So I'm free to go then.

1001
01:12:43.601 --> 01:12:44.726
Wait a second.

1002
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:58.726
In case you want
to press charges against your landlord.


1003
01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.726
Are you okay?

1004
01:13:40.518 --> 01:13:41.518
Thank you.

1005
01:14:30.768 --> 01:14:31.768
Sorry, it's...

1006
01:14:32.351 --> 01:14:33.601
a bit of a mess.

1007
01:14:34.976 --> 01:14:38.351
Uh, I just put the kettle on.
Do you want to stay for a cuppa?


1008
01:14:38.935 --> 01:14:40.143
I'm good.

1009
01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:44.226
Uh, I packed clothes
and Ernie the sheep in the bag.


1010
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:45.810
I... I didn't bring diapers.

1011
01:14:45.893 --> 01:14:47.310
I figured you had those.

1012
01:14:49.268 --> 01:14:51.643
I can pop out
and get some. No worries.

1013
01:14:51.726 --> 01:14:52.726
Okay.

1014
01:14:53.518 --> 01:14:57.435
Hey, there's this kids' art thing
at the park tomorrow.


1015
01:14:57.518 --> 01:15:00.226
I was thinking
of taking Aster if you fancy joining us.


1016
01:15:01.185 --> 01:15:04.560
Maybe we could have lunch after
at Georgio's, the three of us.


1017
01:15:08.101 --> 01:15:09.101
Please.

1018
01:15:12.893 --> 01:15:13.935
Beth.

1019
01:15:29.518 --> 01:15:30.518
Uh...

1020
01:15:31.685 --> 01:15:34.851
You know, uh, I think you might
have my spare car key.


1021
01:15:36.643 --> 01:15:40.768
Yeah, it's probably
in the bowl in the hallway


1022
01:15:40.851 --> 01:15:42.018
or in my jacket.

1023
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:11.143
Oh!

1024
01:16:11.226 --> 01:16:12.685
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

1025
01:16:15.185 --> 01:16:16.935
I... I got it online.

1026
01:16:17.018 --> 01:16:18.268
I can send it back.

1027
01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.060
You all right?

1028
01:16:26.976 --> 01:16:28.310
You find the key?

1029
01:16:35.851 --> 01:16:36.851
Uh...

1030
01:16:36.935 --> 01:16:38.393
Can I use your bathroom?

1031
01:16:39.143 --> 01:16:40.143
Sure.

1032
01:17:08.351 --> 01:17:11.060
Oh my... Oh my God.

1033
01:17:37.268 --> 01:17:38.268
<i>Kovac.</i>

1034
01:17:38.643 --> 01:17:39.643
It's me.

1035
01:17:40.476 --> 01:17:41.560
<i>Beth.</i>

1036
01:17:42.393 --> 01:17:43.393
What's wrong?

1037
01:17:45.851 --> 01:17:48.018
It wasn't Pavic, it was...

1038
01:17:48.101 --> 01:17:49.476
Beth.

1039
01:17:51.226 --> 01:17:52.435
Uh...

1040
01:17:54.101 --> 01:17:55.226
Just a minute.

1041
01:18:20.185 --> 01:18:21.726
- You okay?
- Yeah.


1042
01:18:23.726 --> 01:18:25.476
I can't find Ernie the sheep.

1043
01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.810
Where did you say it was?

1044
01:18:27.976 --> 01:18:29.101
Oh. Uh...

1045
01:18:30.143 --> 01:18:32.685
It's... It's in the
bag. I'll... I'll get it.

1046
01:18:32.768 --> 01:18:35.226
I'm gonna stay for that cup of tea.

1047
01:18:35.310 --> 01:18:37.768
If that's, uh, still up for offer.

1048
01:18:38.935 --> 01:18:39.976
- Yeah.
- Yeah.


1049
01:18:41.518 --> 01:18:42.518
Cool? Okay.

1050
01:18:50.185 --> 01:18:52.601
- Right here.
- Oh. Thanks.


1051
01:18:53.393 --> 01:18:54.393
Sorry.

1052
01:19:02.768 --> 01:19:05.893
Suppose you've got a lot to do
before you start work on Monday.


1053
01:19:05.976 --> 01:19:07.851
Did you get the child-minding sorted?

1054
01:19:10.685 --> 01:19:13.726
You're looking at me strangely. Do you...

1055
01:19:14.393 --> 01:19:15.893
want more milk or...

1056
01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:18.351
You killed Kate.

1057
01:19:22.351 --> 01:19:24.643
- What?
- It wasn't Pavic.


1058
01:19:25.226 --> 01:19:26.226
It was you.

1059
01:19:28.351 --> 01:19:29.893
Is this some kind of joke?

1060
01:19:29.976 --> 01:19:32.560
You flew in Friday night.

1061
01:19:34.726 --> 01:19:36.351
- It's only two hours...
- It's insane.


1062
01:19:36.435 --> 01:19:39.435
You flew back Saturday morning.
Won't be hard to check the flights.


1063
01:19:39.518 --> 01:19:41.685
Beth, come on. 
You can't be serious.

1064
01:19:44.851 --> 01:19:48.476
It's from her necklace,
and I found it in your jacket.


1065
01:20:05.726 --> 01:20:06.726
Listen.

1066
01:20:08.268 --> 01:20:10.435
I can explain. 
It was an accident.

1067
01:20:10.518 --> 01:20:11.518
Oh my God.

1068
01:20:11.976 --> 01:20:15.018
- What did you do?
- Stop. Wait. Listen to me. Listen to me.


1069
01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:18.060
I flew over.

1070
01:20:18.810 --> 01:20:20.851
And I was waiting outside the apartment.

1071
01:20:21.351 --> 01:20:24.226
I'd been calling and texting.
She wasn't picking up. I thought...


1072
01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:25.768
I was terrified she told you.

1073
01:20:26.351 --> 01:20:30.101
She kept threatening to. I thought
if she had, I could at least talk to you.


1074
01:20:30.185 --> 01:20:31.185
Explain things.

1075
01:20:32.435 --> 01:20:34.226
I was about to leave,
but then she showed up.


1076
01:20:36.476 --> 01:20:37.476
Kate.

1077
01:20:37.976 --> 01:20:40.393
Jesus. What the hell are you doing here?

1078
01:20:41.185 --> 01:20:42.393
I needed to see you.

1079
01:20:42.893 --> 01:20:44.351
You know this makes you a stalker.

1080
01:20:44.435 --> 01:20:46.595
I didn't have a choice.
You wouldn't answer your phone.


1081
01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:50.185
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

1082
01:20:53.476 --> 01:20:54.476
Went for a walk.

1083
01:20:55.393 --> 01:20:58.226
We ended up down by the water,
and we talked.


1084
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:59.351
Kate.

1085
01:20:59.435 --> 01:21:00.435
What?

1086
01:21:01.268 --> 01:21:02.268
Have you told her?

1087
01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.060
You going to?

1088
01:21:08.351 --> 01:21:11.185
You're gonna ruin her life.
You wanna do that? I don't.


1089
01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:13.560
Not unless...

1090
01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:17.726
we're doing this. You and me.

1091
01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:19.393
For God's sake, Rob.

1092
01:21:19.476 --> 01:21:22.310
How many times? 
It meant nothing.

1093
01:21:22.393 --> 01:21:24.185
How can you say it meant nothing?

1094
01:21:24.685 --> 01:21:27.143
Why were we doing
it if it meant nothing?

1095
01:21:28.518 --> 01:21:30.310
Yeah. Yeah.

1096
01:21:30.393 --> 01:21:32.851
I know. You have feelings for me.

1097
01:21:34.976 --> 01:21:37.476
She told me...
She told me she was in love with me.


1098
01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.101
She, she, she... 
She kept begging me.

1099
01:21:41.185 --> 01:21:42.976
She was begging me to leave you.

1100
01:21:43.476 --> 01:21:46.327
She said you were unhappy. I'd be
doing you a favor breaking up with you.


1101
01:21:46.351 --> 01:21:49.310
I told her, I don't know how many times,
that was never gonna happen.


1102
01:21:49.393 --> 01:21:50.393
Stop.

1103
01:21:51.351 --> 01:21:53.893
What happened between us was a mistake.

1104
01:21:56.768 --> 01:21:58.685
It was the biggest mistake of my life?

1105
01:21:59.476 --> 01:22:00.810
It wasn't.

1106
01:22:01.476 --> 01:22:03.435
It was a rebound fling, and you...

1107
01:22:04.101 --> 01:22:06.810
...were in the right place
at the right time.


1108
01:22:07.476 --> 01:22:09.268
- That's all.
- You're lying.


1109
01:22:10.268 --> 01:22:13.935
Actually, from now on,
I'm only telling the truth.


1110
01:22:15.101 --> 01:22:18.560
- Maybe you should try it too.
- Please, please, Kate, please.


1111
01:22:18.643 --> 01:22:20.685
- Don't tell her.
- Get off me.


1112
01:22:20.768 --> 01:22:21.851
Kate, come here.

1113
01:22:24.518 --> 01:22:25.768
Listen.

1114
01:22:25.851 --> 01:22:27.976
- Stop it! Get off me!
- No, stop, listen to me!


1115
01:22:28.060 --> 01:22:29.060
I was angry.

1116
01:22:29.685 --> 01:22:30.685
I lashed out.

1117
01:22:34.643 --> 01:22:35.476
I hit her.

1118
01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:36.643
Will you please...

1119
01:22:38.226 --> 01:22:39.518
It just happened.

1120
01:22:39.601 --> 01:22:41.685
She tripped and fell and banged her head.

1121
01:22:41.768 --> 01:22:44.435
I didn't mean to hurt her.

1122
01:22:59.768 --> 01:23:00.768
<i>No.</i>

1123
01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:02.518
You let her drown.

1124
01:23:03.935 --> 01:23:06.476
No. No, I... I thought she was dead.

1125
01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.411
- No, you didn't.
- That's why I left her.


1126
01:23:08.435 --> 01:23:11.143
You're lying.
I saw the autopsy report. She drowned.


1127
01:23:11.226 --> 01:23:13.786
- She was alive in the water when you left.
- I'm telling the truth.


1128
01:23:13.810 --> 01:23:15.810
- You have to listen.
- No, I don't have to listen!


1129
01:23:15.893 --> 01:23:19.060
I will never listen to you again.
I should've listened to Kate.


1130
01:23:20.018 --> 01:23:21.726
That's what the weekend was about.

1131
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:24.810
She wanted to remind me
who I was before I met you.


1132
01:23:25.518 --> 01:23:26.893
That I deserve better.

1133
01:23:28.476 --> 01:23:31.268
- What are you gonna do now, huh?
- You killed my best friend.


1134
01:23:31.351 --> 01:23:33.101
You're not gonna tell the police, are you?

1135
01:23:34.226 --> 01:23:37.018
What would be the point?
The case's closed. That cop's dead.


1136
01:23:37.101 --> 01:23:39.935
What good is me going to jail? Beth?

1137
01:23:40.018 --> 01:23:42.601
Please, I'm begging you. I'm begging you.

1138
01:23:43.226 --> 01:23:44.768
Please, think about Aster.

1139
01:23:45.518 --> 01:23:47.435
You want her to
grow up without a dad?

1140
01:23:48.518 --> 01:23:50.226
Her dad's a murderer.

1141
01:23:51.143 --> 01:23:53.018
Come on, you know I'm not.

1142
01:23:53.101 --> 01:23:55.226
No. You are not calling the police.

1143
01:23:56.268 --> 01:23:57.268
I already have.

1144
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:02.143
<i>Beth, are you there?</i>

1145
01:24:02.226 --> 01:24:04.851
I got it all.
The police are on their way. Beth?


1146
01:24:06.101 --> 01:24:07.268
Ow. Ow.

1147
01:24:07.351 --> 01:24:08.185
Let go.

1148
01:24:08.268 --> 01:24:10.018
Let go of me.

1149
01:24:10.726 --> 01:24:12.310
Get your hands off me.

1150
01:24:16.976 --> 01:24:20.268
It's okay. Mama's got you.
Mama's got you.
