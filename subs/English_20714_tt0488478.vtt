00:05:07.855 --> 00:05:09.356
Mama!

00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:11.817
Speak Russian!

50
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:24.320
Speak Russian, Mama!

51
00:05:35.508 --> 00:05:39.803
Court is adjourned until
the jury reaches a verdict.


52
00:05:41.764 --> 00:05:43.974
All rise please.

53
00:05:50.273 --> 00:05:51.440
Hello?

54
00:05:52.316 --> 00:05:53.775
Hungry, dad?

55
00:05:54.193 --> 00:05:56.361
So far everything's fine. Yes.

56
00:05:58.364 --> 00:06:02.617
Those photographs
l showed thejudge, can I take them?


57
00:06:02.743 --> 00:06:04.161
l don't know.

58
00:06:04.328 --> 00:06:06.663
- Do I have to stay here?
- Yes.


59
00:06:06.873 --> 00:06:10.333
- But I told them everything.
- That's how itworks.


60
00:06:11.377 --> 00:06:13.587
- OK, gentlemen...
- That's crazy.


61
00:06:13.796 --> 00:06:18.133
Please follow me.
Hurry, please, it's almost recess.


62
00:06:19.635 --> 00:06:21.803
- What recess?
- You'll see.


63
00:06:22.013 --> 00:06:24.222
Please keep up. Follow me.

64
00:06:29.937 --> 00:06:33.148
This way, please. Let's go.

65
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.860
As you see, the work's notfinished.

66
00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.280
the jury room's not ready, either.
This way...


67
00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:45.952
Remodeling makes it hard to work.
No matter, your case is simple.


68
00:06:47.163 --> 00:06:49.372
You'll be done in 20 minutes.

69
00:06:49.582 --> 00:06:54.419
Now we're in the adjoining school building,
they lend us space.


70
00:06:54.545 --> 00:06:58.173
A school by a courthouse
causes problems.


71
00:06:58.341 --> 00:07:00.759
lmagine the spring, the windows open...

72
00:07:00.968 --> 00:07:04.012
...a ball flies in and hits a witness
on the head


73
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.264
An elderly woman, out cold.

74
00:07:06.474 --> 00:07:09.392
During the school vacation
itwas fine...


75
00:07:09.602 --> 00:07:12.979
...we used the classrooms...
Oops, we're too late.


76
00:07:13.147 --> 00:07:14.689
Children! Children!

77
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:16.942
Oh, Lord. Children.

78
00:07:17.151 --> 00:07:19.945
Children!
Children, please.


79
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.990
Now we turn left.
This way, everyone this way.


80
00:07:28.454 --> 00:07:32.290
Some working conditions!
But it'sjust temporary.


81
00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:36.711
They'll finish and it'll be
pretty as a picture.


82
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.551
One silly formality.

83
00:07:42.718 --> 00:07:46.137
You'll have to give me your phones,
I'm afraid.


84
00:07:46.305 --> 00:07:48.723
I'll keep my SlM, it's important.

85
00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:50.559
Hello, Vasia.

86
00:07:50.768 --> 00:07:52.727
My phone'll be off for 90 minutes.

87
00:07:53.229 --> 00:07:57.399
Tell the boss it's my civic duty.

88
00:07:57.567 --> 00:07:59.067
I'll be right here.

89
00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.654
lf you need me for any reason...

90
00:08:02.822 --> 00:08:05.949
...there's a communication system.
Here it is.


91
00:08:07.243 --> 00:08:09.953
This is my little "know-how".

92
00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:12.455
That means "invention".

93
00:08:13.082 --> 00:08:16.793
l took itfrom my son's
model train set.


94
00:08:17.169 --> 00:08:18.962
lt reallyworks.

95
00:08:19.171 --> 00:08:21.131
Watch, everyone.
Push the button.


96
00:08:21.632 --> 00:08:23.216
That's awful.

97
00:08:25.845 --> 00:08:27.512
You keep this.

98
00:08:27.722 --> 00:08:30.974
And if you need me,
forthe slightest reason, call me...


99
00:08:31.142 --> 00:08:35.770
and I'll bring
whateveryou require or desire.


100
00:08:35.896 --> 00:08:39.149
Here's where you'll be meeting.
All the amenities. Go ahead.


101
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:43.445
Go ahead.

102
00:08:49.452 --> 00:08:50.994
Hands...

103
00:09:02.089 --> 00:09:06.426
- They put us in a gym?
- the jury room's not ready.


104
00:09:12.892 --> 00:09:17.437
Anyone know how long it takes
to get to Kursk station?


105
00:09:17.563 --> 00:09:20.190
ln weather like this.

106
00:09:20.483 --> 00:09:24.235
At least an hour and a half.
Maybe a little longer.


107
00:09:24.403 --> 00:09:25.904
You're kidding.

108
00:09:28.699 --> 00:09:30.825
Come on, take a shot.

109
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:34.537
- With this thing?
- Come on.


110
00:09:34.914 --> 00:09:37.207
- Go Spartak.
- Here it comes!


111
00:09:42.922 --> 00:09:45.006
- What was that?
- You told me to.


112
00:09:45.216 --> 00:09:48.009
That's a medicine ball.

113
00:09:49.011 --> 00:09:50.929
That's an antique.

114
00:09:51.222 --> 00:09:53.306
- You mean the lamp?
- Yeah.


115
00:09:53.516 --> 00:09:56.393
We had exactly the same kind
in my school.


116
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:58.019
- Kids use these?
- Sure.


117
00:09:58.229 --> 00:10:00.522
Do you know where the bathroom is?

118
00:10:12.618 --> 00:10:14.411
They're locking us in?

119
00:10:15.996 --> 00:10:18.957
They have to, those are the rules.

120
00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:30.427
Seen that?

121
00:10:31.095 --> 00:10:33.054
Why is it in there?

122
00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:37.308
- Maybe so the kids don't hurt it.
- Orvice versa.


123
00:10:38.018 --> 00:10:41.938
Or vice versa, so they
don't hurt themselves on it.


124
00:10:42.106 --> 00:10:43.982
lt could fall.

125
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:46.526
A courthouse isn't...

126
00:10:46.736 --> 00:10:49.738
the best thing to have
next to a school.


127
00:10:51.907 --> 00:10:53.158
ltwon'tfall.

128
00:10:53.367 --> 00:10:56.703
Even the piano's behind bars
and on the rack.


129
00:10:56.871 --> 00:10:58.413
The bathroom.

130
00:11:05.838 --> 00:11:07.338
Smart, no?

131
00:11:07.923 --> 00:11:12.802
Why don't you have some?
Help yourself, it's for all of us.


132
00:11:12.928 --> 00:11:16.014
- What is it, cheese?
- And tea with lemon.


133
00:11:16.182 --> 00:11:18.349
Thanks. Thanks anyway.

134
00:11:18.851 --> 00:11:21.978
l have a business lunch
at Cafe Pushkin.


135
00:11:22.229 --> 00:11:24.856
Don'twant to spoil my appetite.

136
00:11:25.024 --> 00:11:27.942
And this won't take very long, right?

137
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.945
l doubt it. It's
not that kind of case.

138
00:11:34.742 --> 00:11:36.826
l agree.

139
00:11:37.036 --> 00:11:38.661
We have

140
00:11:39.914 --> 00:11:42.624
a different kind of case.

141
00:11:45.336 --> 00:11:48.338
That's an antique. How quaint.

142
00:11:50.591 --> 00:11:52.425
l had it stashed away.

143
00:11:52.635 --> 00:11:55.136
l forgot and didn't
exchange it in time.


144
00:11:55.346 --> 00:11:57.180
l was so angry...

145
00:12:03.395 --> 00:12:05.355
Comrades... I mean...

146
00:12:06.315 --> 00:12:08.441
...gentlemen. Let's start.

147
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:17.033
Yes, comrades, I mean, gentlemen,
why don'twe start?


148
00:12:17.201 --> 00:12:19.702
l don't have much time.

149
00:12:19.912 --> 00:12:22.163
You in a hurry?

150
00:12:22.373 --> 00:12:26.167
And how: My train's in an hour.
I'm going on tour.


151
00:12:26.335 --> 00:12:29.254
This'll take an hour, max.
The bathroom...


152
00:12:29.421 --> 00:12:32.382
This one's forthe kids.
VlPs go overthere.


153
00:12:33.092 --> 00:12:35.009
Can anyone tell me...

154
00:12:35.261 --> 00:12:38.096
...what rhymes with "Julie"?

155
00:12:38.931 --> 00:12:42.809
- Julie - cruelly.
- Cruelly? That's no good.


156
00:12:43.185 --> 00:12:46.771
- It's a beautiful girl named Julie.
- Julie?


157
00:12:47.982 --> 00:12:49.357
Here you go...

158
00:12:49.525 --> 00:12:53.111
Duly.
Newly. Unruly.


159
00:12:53.946 --> 00:12:58.491
O'Dooley. Fazooli. Babooli.
Coolly...


160
00:12:58.659 --> 00:13:00.618
Woolly.

161
00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:03.746
Truly.

162
00:13:04.456 --> 00:13:06.541
- Patchouli.
- Patchouli?


163
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.877
Patchouli. Truly.

164
00:13:09.086 --> 00:13:11.421
Mamooli. Pap...

165
00:13:14.258 --> 00:13:15.800
Oh, God...

166
00:13:19.805 --> 00:13:21.347
- Is today the 12th?
- Yeah.


167
00:13:22.349 --> 00:13:25.435
- Where's the TV? Over here?
- Right there.


168
00:13:27.146 --> 00:13:29.439
They're interviewing my mother.

169
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.193
Is she a politician? An actress?

170
00:13:34.361 --> 00:13:36.529
- lt doesn'twork?
- No.


171
00:13:37.698 --> 00:13:39.365
What is this? That's it.

172
00:13:46.457 --> 00:13:48.333
lt doesn'twork.

173
00:13:49.668 --> 00:13:53.671
Our family has a TV company.
LTV. Have you heard of it?


174
00:13:54.256 --> 00:13:56.299
My mother's the president.

175
00:13:56.842 --> 00:14:00.094
I'm the managing director.
l help Mom.


176
00:14:02.973 --> 00:14:05.350
So you're an assistant producer.

177
00:14:08.687 --> 00:14:10.855
Must be a weak stomach...

178
00:14:12.566 --> 00:14:14.984
- Have you ever seen anything like this?
- Sorry.


179
00:14:15.235 --> 00:14:17.153
Ever seen one like this?

180
00:14:17.363 --> 00:14:21.366
And she's still just a school girl.
They must be well fed.


181
00:14:21.533 --> 00:14:25.328
l only saw ones this big
once in my life.


182
00:14:25.746 --> 00:14:28.873
- On a schoolgirl?
- What? Heavens, no.


183
00:14:28.999 --> 00:14:33.044
My mother-in-law's were about this size.

184
00:14:33.879 --> 00:14:36.756
We buried her three months ago.

185
00:14:36.924 --> 00:14:38.508
Oh, jeez!

186
00:14:39.259 --> 00:14:42.387
"Schoolmates!"

187
00:14:43.097 --> 00:14:45.598
"Boys and girls!"

188
00:14:45.808 --> 00:14:47.350
- Lookwhat I found.
- Oh, wow.


189
00:14:47.601 --> 00:14:50.812
"We sing the same songs"

190
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.773
"We read the same books"

191
00:14:53.983 --> 00:14:56.067
- Let me see. God.
- Advanced classes!


192
00:15:11.792 --> 00:15:13.376
Forgive me.

193
00:15:13.836 --> 00:15:18.006
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:19.049 --> 00:15:23.845
l lost my brother because
ofthatjunk.


195
00:15:27.141 --> 00:15:29.684
He was 36!

196
00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:34.147
Oh, mama!
How much misfortune...


197
00:15:34.398 --> 00:15:37.859
l have seen from thisjunk.

198
00:15:40.612 --> 00:15:42.280
I'm sorry.

199
00:15:58.088 --> 00:16:01.966
Gentlemen of the jury...
Let's get this show on the road.


200
00:16:02.342 --> 00:16:04.343
Who's leading this parade?

201
00:16:04.803 --> 00:16:06.971
- Yes, let's start.
- Let's go.


202
00:16:07.181 --> 00:16:10.224
Actually, we do have to...

203
00:16:10.768 --> 00:16:15.313
...choose a chairman for our meeting,
l mean for ourjury.


204
00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:20.401
You seem to have some experience.
You should be Our foreman...


205
00:16:22.488 --> 00:16:27.033
The phone only connects
to the boiler room.


206
00:16:27.451 --> 00:16:29.410
lf nobody objects...

207
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.454
I'd be glad to.

208
00:16:31.663 --> 00:16:34.457
So, no need to vote on it, then?

209
00:16:34.625 --> 00:16:39.962
As you know, our decision
must be, and will be, final.


210
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.965
And not subject to appeal.

211
00:16:43.842 --> 00:16:47.470
And so... Attention, please.
And so...


212
00:16:47.638 --> 00:16:50.807
...ourvote has got to be unanimous.

213
00:16:51.183 --> 00:16:54.018
We know all that.
Let's just do it fast.


214
00:16:54.186 --> 00:16:58.064
Make a unanimous decision...
and leave. I'm going on tour.


215
00:16:58.232 --> 00:17:03.152
We can each make comments one by one.
Then we'll vote.


216
00:17:03.278 --> 00:17:05.530
- No, let's vote.
- It's obvious.


217
00:17:05.739 --> 00:17:07.990
- Let's vote now.
- No comments.


218
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.910
- Then nobody objects if...
- No, no.


219
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.162
So, we can...

220
00:17:14.206 --> 00:17:18.251
...vote by the usual show of hands,
or by paper ballot.


221
00:17:19.002 --> 00:17:21.087
- No, by hands.
- Right.


222
00:17:21.338 --> 00:17:24.966
- Let's vote.
- So we'll vote by a show of hands?


223
00:17:25.134 --> 00:17:27.009
- Yes, yes.
- Of course.


224
00:17:27.219 --> 00:17:30.388
All in favor, please raise your hands.

225
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.559
One question.
"ln favor" ofwhat?


226
00:17:34.726 --> 00:17:38.104
- What?
- "ln favor" of guilty, or not guilty?


227
00:17:38.272 --> 00:17:40.231
Guilty, of course.

228
00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:43.484
l thought itwas "in favor" ofvoting.

229
00:17:43.652 --> 00:17:47.071
We're voting on whether he is guilty.

230
00:17:47.239 --> 00:17:50.283
l didn't understand, that's all.

231
00:17:52.119 --> 00:17:55.788
- He didn't know
- Put down your hands. Sorry.


232
00:17:55.956 --> 00:17:59.458
That vote didn't count.
Myfault. Sorry.


233
00:17:59.626 --> 00:18:01.836
So... Put your hands down.

234
00:18:02.045 --> 00:18:05.173
So we're voting...

235
00:18:05.424 --> 00:18:09.552
...on whetherthe defendant is guilty.

236
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.930
A raised hand means guilty.

237
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.265
- Yes, yes.
- Guilty.


238
00:18:14.808 --> 00:18:16.934
l justwant to get it right.
Then raise your hand.


239
00:18:17.144 --> 00:18:20.813
Don't you go to meetings?

240
00:18:20.981 --> 00:18:23.024
What? All the time.

241
00:18:23.901 --> 00:18:25.776
Workers of the world...

242
00:18:25.986 --> 00:18:27.778
- Let's vote, come on.
- Yeah.


243
00:18:27.988 --> 00:18:31.115
Why are we voting on "guilty" first?

244
00:18:31.283 --> 00:18:33.993
What's the difference?

245
00:18:34.786 --> 00:18:38.581
No, we can do this howeverwe like.

246
00:18:38.749 --> 00:18:40.833
Does it botheryou?

247
00:18:42.002 --> 00:18:44.921
No, I thought it might be a rule.

248
00:18:45.088 --> 00:18:48.841
No, there's no rule about that.
Eitherway.


249
00:18:49.009 --> 00:18:52.803
- Let's do it this way.
- Forwhether he's guilty.


250
00:18:52.971 --> 00:18:58.059
OK. So we're voting on
whetherthe defendant is guilty.


251
00:18:58.185 --> 00:18:59.810
- Yes.
- Hands up, please.


252
00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:03.022
- Unanimous. We're out of here.
- No, wait.


253
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.651
Please. There are rules. Wait

254
00:19:07.069 --> 00:19:11.822
Please take your seats.
Put your hands down.


255
00:19:11.949 --> 00:19:14.784
Now, who thinks the defendant -
we have to follow rules...


256
00:19:14.952 --> 00:19:19.080
...is not guilty, please raise your hand.

257
00:19:22.584 --> 00:19:24.543
That's eleven...

258
00:19:24.753 --> 00:19:27.588
- Here
- Eleven for guilty, one for not guilty.


259
00:19:27.756 --> 00:19:29.507
Whoa!

260
00:19:30.926 --> 00:19:33.219
What did wejust vote on?

261
00:19:34.721 --> 00:19:37.515
Did you hearthat? Hello!

262
00:19:37.683 --> 00:19:40.184
All that racket distracted the man.

263
00:19:40.394 --> 00:19:45.189
We voted on whetherthat stinking
Chechen dog is guilty...


264
00:19:45.315 --> 00:19:49.527
...of the murder of his adoptive father,
a Russian army officer.


265
00:19:49.695 --> 00:19:51.112
Didn't understand?

266
00:19:51.321 --> 00:19:54.532
The comrade didn't understand.
Start again.


267
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:59.120
- So let's vote again.
- No, no, l...


268
00:20:00.497 --> 00:20:03.666
There's no need. I get it now.
I'm against.


269
00:20:04.251 --> 00:20:06.419
Against convicting him.

270
00:20:14.845 --> 00:20:16.637
What do you mean "against"?

271
00:20:19.516 --> 00:20:21.684
You voted "for".

272
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.730
And I voted "against".

273
00:20:26.231 --> 00:20:27.481
Why?

274
00:20:27.899 --> 00:20:31.360
Well, itwas eleven "for"...

275
00:20:32.446 --> 00:20:34.488
...and one "against".

276
00:20:37.409 --> 00:20:39.160
Butwhy?

277
00:20:39.703 --> 00:20:41.203
Whywhat?

278
00:20:41.997 --> 00:20:44.623
Why did you vote thatway?

279
00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:52.048
Well, if I'd voted "for"
itwould have been twelve "for" and...


280
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.218
...none "against".
And we'd all have gone home.


281
00:20:57.054 --> 00:21:00.639
But that'd be good.
So why'd you vote "against"?


282
00:21:00.807 --> 00:21:03.309
Vote "for" and let's go home.

283
00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:06.604
l... ltwas too fast, somehow.

284
00:21:07.356 --> 00:21:10.274
ltwas too fast, you see.

285
00:21:10.484 --> 00:21:15.654
Fast? We listened to thatjudge talk
for 3 days. You call thatfast?


286
00:21:15.781 --> 00:21:18.491
No, well, yes, but...

287
00:21:19.201 --> 00:21:23.037
lt scared me.
Wejust put up our hands and...


288
00:21:23.205 --> 00:21:25.373
...thatwas it. ltwas too fast.

289
00:21:25.749 --> 00:21:29.168
Fast is good. ltwas obvious,
there was proof.


290
00:21:29.336 --> 00:21:32.922
We all heard the witnesses.
We sawthe evidence.


291
00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.632
Well, yes.

292
00:21:36.927 --> 00:21:41.430
Butwe're talking about a human being.

293
00:21:42.849 --> 00:21:45.559
And wejust put up our hands...

294
00:21:45.727 --> 00:21:47.603
...and thatwas it.

295
00:21:50.816 --> 00:21:53.984
What exactly do you want?

296
00:22:00.158 --> 00:22:01.700
l want...

297
00:22:10.168 --> 00:22:12.628
...well, to talk, at least.

298
00:22:24.474 --> 00:22:25.975
To talk.

299
00:22:32.482 --> 00:22:33.983
So talk.

300
00:22:52.043 --> 00:22:55.004
"Beyond reasonable doubt. "

301
00:22:59.050 --> 00:23:04.513
Sorry. That's a term
used in Americanjury trials.


302
00:23:05.765 --> 00:23:09.226
"Beyond reasonable doubt".

303
00:23:09.394 --> 00:23:13.022
It'sjust that, 
I studied at Harvard...

304
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:17.818
...l studied management.
And we had a course in law.


305
00:23:18.153 --> 00:23:24.116
Talking would make sense
if there were reasonable doubt.


306
00:23:24.326 --> 00:23:29.246
Did you hearthat? Reasonable doubt.
We don't have any doubts


307
00:23:29.498 --> 00:23:32.041
None. He killed him! It's a fact!

308
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:37.421
The brutal murder of an ex-officer
by his adopted son for a ridiculous sum.


309
00:23:37.506 --> 00:23:39.381
- Yeah.
- Why talk?


310
00:23:39.549 --> 00:23:42.468
That guywent to Harvard,
and he doesn't have any doubts.


311
00:23:42.677 --> 00:23:45.179
- Neither do we. Do you?
- Do you?


312
00:23:45.764 --> 00:23:48.390
Forgive me, please, and understand.

313
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.935
l know he went to Harvard.

314
00:23:52.187 --> 00:23:55.606
Sayyou go to the market
and buy a watermelon.


315
00:23:57.067 --> 00:23:59.944
- I do?
- No, no, I do.


316
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.030
l go to the
market and buy a melon.

317
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.369
The salesman assures me
it's ripe and red, but...


318
00:24:09.579 --> 00:24:11.914
...until I take it home...

319
00:24:12.666 --> 00:24:17.086
...and cut it open,
it's very hard to knowfor sure if it is.


320
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.257
But this isn't a watermelon.

321
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.261
Awatermelon you canjust throw away.

322
00:24:47.951 --> 00:24:50.578
This is a human being
facing a life sentence.


323
00:24:50.787 --> 00:24:54.623
lfwe all vote yes,
they'll put him in prison forever.


324
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.252
And he'll never get out.

325
00:25:00.338 --> 00:25:02.756
Do you understand? Ne-ver!

326
00:25:02.966 --> 00:25:05.467
Just think about thatword.

327
00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.347
He'll never get out.

328
00:25:11.433 --> 00:25:13.309
And he shouldn't.

329
00:25:13.602 --> 00:25:16.812
He's a killer. 
What should he get?

330
00:25:17.188 --> 00:25:19.273
A paid vacation to Thailand?

331
00:25:21.026 --> 00:25:25.362
He should be grateful
they banned the death penalty.


332
00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.407
Prison will put some sense into him.

333
00:25:40.962 --> 00:25:50.638
All right.

334
00:25:52.932 --> 00:25:54.308
Fine.

335
00:25:54.684 --> 00:25:57.394
l don'twant to keep you.

336
00:25:57.562 --> 00:26:01.899
Let's vote again
and if I'm still the only one, I'll...


337
00:26:02.192 --> 00:26:04.276
...vote with everyone else.

338
00:26:04.486 --> 00:26:07.321
And let the boy's fate be what itwill.

339
00:26:07.489 --> 00:26:11.659
At least I'll know I tried
to do something for him.


340
00:26:12.202 --> 00:26:14.411
That's an interesting move.

341
00:26:15.288 --> 00:26:20.668
Essentially, you'll do
what everyone else does,


342
00:26:21.044 --> 00:26:26.507
but you'll still be able to believe that
your hands are clean. Right?


343
00:26:29.636 --> 00:26:31.053
Yes.

344
00:26:32.013 --> 00:26:33.931
lt looks thatway.

345
00:26:35.016 --> 00:26:37.434
But I request a secret ballot.

346
00:26:38.812 --> 00:26:40.020
Why?

347
00:26:41.439 --> 00:26:44.066
Honestly? To stall fortime.

348
00:26:44.275 --> 00:26:46.985
We have to get paper, pens.
That takes time.


349
00:26:47.529 --> 00:26:50.406
Also, people often vote...

350
00:26:50.573 --> 00:26:53.575
...just so they don't
strayfrom the group.


351
00:26:53.743 --> 00:26:57.788
So I request thatwe vote
by secret ballot.


352
00:26:58.957 --> 00:27:03.335
Secret or not, it's obvious
what the resultwill be.


353
00:27:21.062 --> 00:27:25.691
So, we have a proposal for
a secret ballot


354
00:27:26.109 --> 00:27:28.986
- Does everyone agree?
- Yeah.


355
00:27:30.447 --> 00:27:34.908
- With these?
- Yes, take a ballot and a pencil or pen.


356
00:27:35.076 --> 00:27:39.163
lf we're ready to vote,
let's see if we're all here.


357
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.956
Wait...

358
00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:44.501
Someone's missing.

359
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.262
That gentleman went to the bathroom.
l saw him.


360
00:27:57.515 --> 00:28:02.352
- I saw him, honest.
- Whywait? Let's vote.


361
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.147
- He's an elderly man.
- Let's start.


362
00:28:05.356 --> 00:28:08.650
He has to get there and pee,
maybe a bad prostate...


363
00:28:08.777 --> 00:28:11.403
Then put all his equipment back in...

364
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.908
The ballot box. Let's vote.

365
00:28:33.009 --> 00:28:35.719
l see you've done this before.

366
00:28:35.929 --> 00:28:38.972
Yeah. Retirement's boring.

367
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:45.103
I sit at my dacha and paint water colors.
Sometimes I serve onjuries.


368
00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:48.982
- You're an artist?
- No, not really.


369
00:28:49.317 --> 00:28:52.277
l just paintwatercolors as a hobby.

370
00:28:57.951 --> 00:29:01.078
Has everyone turned in their ballot?

371
00:29:04.916 --> 00:29:09.461
- Did you vote already?
- No, we were waiting for you.


372
00:29:09.629 --> 00:29:13.131
"With birth and urination,
there's no procrastination".


373
00:29:13.758 --> 00:29:15.592
Don't worry, I'll be fast.

374
00:29:15.885 --> 00:29:17.845
What a great one-liner!

375
00:29:23.268 --> 00:29:25.310
- Thankyou.
- Sorry.


376
00:29:32.402 --> 00:29:33.986
Well...

377
00:29:36.489 --> 00:29:38.115
Let's count...
... shall we?


378
00:29:41.077 --> 00:29:51.077
"Guilty".

379
00:30:25.538 --> 00:30:27.247
"Not guilty".

380
00:30:44.682 --> 00:30:45.933
"Guilty".

381
00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:50.938
So, that's ten...

382
00:30:51.272 --> 00:30:54.441
...for "guilty," and one against.

383
00:30:54.609 --> 00:30:59.071
Two.

384
00:31:13.127 --> 00:31:15.337
Two. For "not guilty".

385
00:31:15.546 --> 00:31:16.964
What? Two?

386
00:31:17.173 --> 00:31:19.091
Wait. That can't be.

387
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.843
Let me check those ballots.

388
00:31:22.053 --> 00:31:23.804
There's no need.

389
00:31:24.347 --> 00:31:26.556
No need to check anything.

390
00:31:26.766 --> 00:31:30.769
l voted to find the young man
not guilty.


391
00:31:32.647 --> 00:31:33.981
What?

392
00:31:36.025 --> 00:31:39.194
5 minutes ago you voted
that the kid is guilty.


393
00:31:39.362 --> 00:31:41.571
Atfirst it seemed clear.

394
00:31:43.574 --> 00:31:47.619
- And now it doesn't?
- No, I can't say it's not clear.


395
00:31:47.787 --> 00:31:50.288
But this man...

396
00:31:50.623 --> 00:31:54.668
...proposed that I take responsibility
for his decision, as well.


397
00:31:55.128 --> 00:31:58.338
And you know, I began to think.

398
00:31:58.506 --> 00:32:00.215
Aboutwhat?

399
00:32:01.134 --> 00:32:05.262
Excuse me, but I don't understand.
This is some sort of Jewish logic.


400
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:07.222
Absolutely correct.

401
00:32:07.432 --> 00:32:10.642
I'm a Jew. 100 per cent Jewish.

402
00:32:10.935 --> 00:32:13.562
And like everyone,
l have tons offaults.


403
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:17.649
But I do have one virtue.
And it's an innately Jewish one.


404
00:32:17.817 --> 00:32:20.027
Thoughtfulness. 
I treasure it.

405
00:32:20.236 --> 00:32:24.322
l became thoughtful and went off
to think...


406
00:32:24.449 --> 00:32:27.534
And you know,
l began to have doubts.


407
00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.660
Why?

408
00:32:28.995 --> 00:32:30.245
The lawyer.

409
00:32:32.165 --> 00:32:35.459
- The lawyerwhat?
- He was bored.


410
00:32:36.419 --> 00:32:40.422
Why be excited?
That Chechen monster killed his father.


411
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:43.967
l had the impression
he wasn't even defending him.


412
00:32:44.677 --> 00:32:48.055
And he was right!
There's no reason to defend him.


413
00:32:48.222 --> 00:32:51.808
Exactly. There was no reason.

414
00:32:52.018 --> 00:32:55.937
The boy is destitute,
the lawyer's eyes were empty:


415
00:32:56.105 --> 00:32:59.232
The face of a drunk,
he couldn'tfunction.


416
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.027
Is it because he's not Jewish?

417
00:33:02.487 --> 00:33:04.863
Drunk? Maybe, but honest.

418
00:33:05.073 --> 00:33:07.991
Didn't let a killer offthe hook.
But you had a hunch.


419
00:33:08.159 --> 00:33:09.868
You should pray after a hunch.

420
00:33:10.078 --> 00:33:12.162
10 adults had no hunch at all.

421
00:33:12.371 --> 00:33:14.998
- But you did.
- ln the can.


422
00:33:15.166 --> 00:33:17.876
Exactly, a sudden hunch in the can.

423
00:33:18.086 --> 00:33:19.920
l think better in there.

424
00:33:20.129 --> 00:33:24.299
Everyone does.
Why are you so worried?


425
00:33:24.467 --> 00:33:29.096
There are 10 of you and only 2 of us.
We should be worried.


426
00:33:29.305 --> 00:33:31.014
But I am worried.

427
00:33:31.224 --> 00:33:34.476
l am worried, see.
How can I not be?


428
00:33:34.769 --> 00:33:38.021
Because I see howyou and your
Jewish tricks...


429
00:33:38.606 --> 00:33:41.316
...are muddying an obvious case.

430
00:33:41.484 --> 00:33:45.529
You didn't like the lawyer,
so youjust changed your mind.


431
00:33:45.696 --> 00:33:48.824
That's a typical Jewish move.

432
00:33:49.158 --> 00:33:50.951
That's enough.

433
00:33:51.619 --> 00:33:54.621
l didn't change my mind.
And I'm half Jewish.


434
00:33:55.873 --> 00:33:58.125
No such thing as a half
-Jew.

435
00:33:58.793 --> 00:34:00.710
Is that a good thing...

436
00:34:02.046 --> 00:34:03.630
...or a bad thing?

437
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:07.092
Nowyou, myfriend...

438
00:34:11.848 --> 00:34:13.765
...stay out of this

439
00:34:17.186 --> 00:34:21.648
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5

440
00:35:08.654 --> 00:35:11.948
Look how much Umar likes your present.

441
00:35:17.038 --> 00:35:20.081
Umar, come eat.
Uncle Volodya is here.


442
00:35:37.975 --> 00:35:39.392
OK, then.

443
00:35:39.894 --> 00:35:42.062
Listen, so you found...

444
00:35:42.271 --> 00:35:47.317
...a good, kind, naive person,
and dragged him overto your side.


445
00:35:47.443 --> 00:35:49.152
- "Braids"
- What?


446
00:35:49.362 --> 00:35:53.323
- What rhymes with it?
- Just a minute. "Braids". "Grenades"!


447
00:35:53.866 --> 00:35:58.203
No, I'm absolutely sure
thatwe'll all reach the same conclusion.


448
00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.666
You'll waste time,
tell us another parable...


449
00:36:02.833 --> 00:36:07.420
...about choosing watermelons
or about howto buyfresh fish.


450
00:36:07.505 --> 00:36:08.922
l don't see why.

451
00:36:09.090 --> 00:36:13.510
You'll make us go over everything
we heard in courtforthree days.


452
00:36:13.678 --> 00:36:16.888
All the evidence
ofthat scumbag's guilt...


453
00:36:17.056 --> 00:36:22.018
...that you'll never disprove,
because you can't. And then?


454
00:36:22.728 --> 00:36:26.606
Then that man'll go
to the can again.


455
00:36:26.774 --> 00:36:29.567
To think. He'll change his decision
to the correct one.


456
00:36:29.735 --> 00:36:32.904
Believe me
that's exactlywhat'll happen.


457
00:36:33.572 --> 00:36:36.616
What I don't get is,
why stall fortime?


458
00:36:37.493 --> 00:36:43.123
To go overthe witness statements again?
You're not blind and deaf.


459
00:36:43.249 --> 00:36:48.461
You sawthat monster sitting in court.

460
00:36:48.713 --> 00:36:51.673
You want to talk?
So let's talk.


461
00:36:51.841 --> 00:36:54.634
Let's talk about howyou think
you can defend a pig...


462
00:36:54.802 --> 00:36:57.762
...who can't possibly bejustified.

463
00:36:58.014 --> 00:37:03.351
How can youjustif y a monster
who attacks his adoptive father?


464
00:37:03.853 --> 00:37:06.396
And notjust attacked...

465
00:37:06.689 --> 00:37:09.316
...but cut his father's throat like a sheep.

466
00:37:09.525 --> 00:37:13.445
He killed the man who took care of him...
... who raised him.


467
00:37:13.612 --> 00:37:17.449
He butchered a man
who had done nothing to him.


468
00:37:17.616 --> 00:37:20.744
Not only that,
but the man who adopted him.


469
00:37:20.953 --> 00:37:24.039
Who saved him.
And it doesn't matterwhy.


470
00:37:24.206 --> 00:37:29.294
For his pension or because
he yelled at him. I don't care about that.


471
00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:35.258
l can't get my head around it.
l couldn't think of a single word to say...


472
00:37:35.384 --> 00:37:38.303
...in defense ofthat bastard.

473
00:37:38.846 --> 00:37:40.847
l don't think any of us could.

474
00:37:41.057 --> 00:37:42.515
l don't thinkyou could.

475
00:37:42.725 --> 00:37:45.352
So then what's the point of
this sideshow?


476
00:37:55.404 --> 00:37:56.863
Sorry.

477
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.452
- I had a wife.
- Wives? I've had three wives.


478
00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:05.538
Wait. I had a wife. I loved her.

479
00:38:05.706 --> 00:38:10.335
- He couldn't keep her... Like the rhyme.
- Justwait. I really loved her.


480
00:38:10.461 --> 00:38:13.588
We had a tiny room
with hardly anyfurniture.


481
00:38:13.756 --> 00:38:17.967
We even ate dinner on the floor,
because we had no table.


482
00:38:18.386 --> 00:38:24.933
l was ajunior researcher
in a physics institute.


483
00:38:25.017 --> 00:38:27.811
l was developing one of my ideas.

484
00:38:27.978 --> 00:38:30.980
So mywife had to work threejobs...

485
00:38:31.148 --> 00:38:33.525
...so we could make ends meet.

486
00:38:33.734 --> 00:38:38.363
Long story short, I invented a new
tunnel diode. It's...


487
00:38:38.531 --> 00:38:40.740
It's hard to explain.

488
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:45.078
Atwork they congratulated me...

489
00:38:45.246 --> 00:38:48.123
...gave me a 50-ruble bonus
and proposed I work on a new project


490
00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:50.291
So I went home...

491
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:55.046
...with the result ofthree years" work:
Fifty rubles.


492
00:38:56.757 --> 00:38:59.217
Mywife gave me a look...

493
00:38:59.635 --> 00:39:01.678
...like you'd give...

494
00:39:04.682 --> 00:39:07.308
Then a large foreign company...

495
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.979
...offered to buy my patent
for a lot of money.


496
00:39:11.105 --> 00:39:14.107
But I said no, I wanted it
to be used here.


497
00:39:14.275 --> 00:39:16.526
l offered it to various places.

498
00:39:16.735 --> 00:39:20.989
They said "It's great".
But nobody needed it. Nobody.


499
00:39:22.032 --> 00:39:25.410
l began to drink.
l began to drink terribly.


500
00:39:25.578 --> 00:39:27.829
l lost myjob, mywife left me.

501
00:39:28.038 --> 00:39:31.458
l only cared about drinking.
Morning, noon, and night.


502
00:39:32.668 --> 00:39:36.629
l was dead drunkfrom morning to night.
ltwas awful.


503
00:39:38.424 --> 00:39:41.551
One day I sensed I would die soon.

504
00:39:42.011 --> 00:39:46.764
And the thought even made me happy,
lt didn't scare me at all.


505
00:39:47.683 --> 00:39:50.143
All I wanted was
for it to be soon.

506
00:39:50.352 --> 00:39:54.189
l began to lookfor death, I really did,
l looked for it.


507
00:39:54.356 --> 00:39:59.319
l would fightwith police, bother people
l got beaten up and cut.


508
00:40:00.237 --> 00:40:03.698
l slept on the street,
in and out of hospitals.


509
00:40:03.866 --> 00:40:05.783
l was beaten to a pulp.

510
00:40:05.993 --> 00:40:09.245
But I'd pull through and
crawl back out.


511
00:40:09.413 --> 00:40:13.166
At home I'd lick mywounds
like a stray dog and then...


512
00:40:13.334 --> 00:40:15.043
...crawl out again.

513
00:40:15.252 --> 00:40:17.045
My onlyfearwas...

514
00:40:17.254 --> 00:40:20.882
...jumping under a train
or out of a window.


515
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.301
Don't know why, itjust scared me.

516
00:40:24.803 --> 00:40:27.931
One day I was on a train,
dreadfully drunk.


517
00:40:28.098 --> 00:40:29.807
l was filthy, I stank.

518
00:40:30.017 --> 00:40:33.895
The train was full
l was bothering everyone:


519
00:40:34.063 --> 00:40:36.272
Yelling, cursing.

520
00:40:36.482 --> 00:40:41.819
But I looked at myself and I was glad.
My vileness made me glad!


521
00:40:44.323 --> 00:40:48.535
My onlywish was
that someone would take me...


522
00:40:49.411 --> 00:40:54.541
...and toss me offthe train
so I'd bash my brains on the rails.


523
00:40:56.544 --> 00:40:59.504
But they alljust sat silently.

524
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:04.551
They looked away, but they sat silently.

525
00:41:06.929 --> 00:41:11.558
Exceptfor one woman
with herfive-year-old daughter.


526
00:41:11.892 --> 00:41:14.018
l heard the little girl say:

527
00:41:14.228 --> 00:41:17.397
"Mama, that man's crazy.
I'm scared".


528
00:41:19.608 --> 00:41:23.778
But the woman said:
"No, he's not crazy.


529
00:41:31.453 --> 00:41:34.330
He'sjust very, very sad".

530
00:41:42.298 --> 00:41:45.758
l sold my invention
to a foreign company.


531
00:41:46.385 --> 00:41:50.388
Today it's used in almost half
of all cell phones.


532
00:41:52.641 --> 00:41:56.311
l work there.
But that's not important.


533
00:41:56.979 --> 00:42:01.608
The woman is now mywife
and the girl is my daughter.


534
00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.736
We also have a son.

535
00:42:05.154 --> 00:42:07.030
He's 4 years old.

536
00:42:10.409 --> 00:42:12.368
Are you done?

537
00:42:23.839 --> 00:42:26.466
No, there's more.

538
00:42:35.559 --> 00:42:38.519
Maybe that kid should...

539
00:42:39.146 --> 00:42:41.230
...die in prison.

540
00:42:41.857 --> 00:42:44.901
Maybe that's his fate. Who knows?

541
00:42:45.527 --> 00:42:49.614
Me, I should have died in the gutter.
But I didn't.


542
00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.536
Because one person, just one...

543
00:42:55.704 --> 00:42:58.665
...looked at me a little more closely...

544
00:42:58.791 --> 00:43:01.042
...than everyone else

545
00:44:00.144 --> 00:44:01.769
Do you like it?

546
00:44:02.312 --> 00:44:03.771
Yeah.

547
00:44:04.189 --> 00:44:06.816
Look how pretty it is.

548
00:44:10.779 --> 00:44:12.405
Thanks.

549
00:45:35.864 --> 00:45:38.407
Umar!

550
00:45:41.286 --> 00:45:42.078
Go home!

551
00:45:43.789 --> 00:45:45.957
Go home and do your homework.
Volodya.


552
00:45:46.875 --> 00:45:50.503
Sorry, myfather's calling me.
Homework.


553
00:45:51.046 --> 00:45:54.423
Don'tworry. You'll get your chance
to fight the Russians.


554
00:45:58.178 --> 00:46:02.056
Hey, friend,
school won't teach him to fight.


555
00:46:02.683 --> 00:46:05.017
What'd you say, friend?
You mind your own business.


556
00:46:06.895 --> 00:46:09.397
We'll deal with this at home
by ourselves.


557
00:46:09.606 --> 00:46:11.399
Volodya, go home. Umar.

558
00:46:15.195 --> 00:46:17.113
Come here, little wolf.

559
00:46:20.325 --> 00:46:22.076
Let's go.

560
00:46:32.212 --> 00:46:36.048
He who has hidden his head under his wife's
petticoatwill neverfind his head again.


561
00:46:56.612 --> 00:47:00.907
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5.

562
00:47:30.103 --> 00:47:34.065
By the way, I asked them to bring
the knife from the murder.


563
00:47:34.232 --> 00:47:35.858
Why?

564
00:47:36.151 --> 00:47:41.530
ln court they kept stressing that
itwas an unusual knife, special.


565
00:47:43.492 --> 00:47:45.201
And that...

566
00:47:47.204 --> 00:47:48.829
Thankyou.

567
00:47:49.456 --> 00:47:52.375
And that only that kid had one.

568
00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.463
You remember?

569
00:47:58.090 --> 00:48:01.258
ln court they kept saying that itwas...

570
00:48:01.969 --> 00:48:03.844
...a unique knife.

571
00:48:04.972 --> 00:48:06.555
Special.

572
00:48:08.392 --> 00:48:09.725
Here.

573
00:48:11.478 --> 00:48:13.396
Let me see.

574
00:48:17.567 --> 00:48:21.320
Yeah. This is a specialized knife.

575
00:48:21.905 --> 00:48:25.700
Used by some units
of the special forces.


576
00:48:27.077 --> 00:48:31.998
Similarto the American model
CQC-7 "hand to hand combat".


577
00:48:32.124 --> 00:48:34.417
Made by Ernst Emerson.

578
00:48:35.419 --> 00:48:37.044
It's monogrammed.

579
00:48:37.921 --> 00:48:41.549
The kid could've brought this knife
from Chechnya.


580
00:48:41.717 --> 00:48:43.467
They're black market there.

581
00:48:44.261 --> 00:48:47.722
You can't buy a knife like this
in Moscow.


582
00:48:48.557 --> 00:48:53.185
This knife has devastating
stabbing power.


583
00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.314
Oh my!

584
00:50:01.171 --> 00:50:04.673
PAPA
MAMA


585
00:50:08.512 --> 00:50:10.387
It's that...

586
00:50:10.597 --> 00:50:12.348
A major in the special forces.

587
00:50:13.141 --> 00:50:18.562
His unitwas fighting in the area
where the defendant lived.


588
00:50:18.688 --> 00:50:21.690
Later he adopted him.

589
00:50:21.858 --> 00:50:23.609
Did you lose something?

590
00:50:23.819 --> 00:50:25.361
- Hey, what if...
- No.


591
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:30.116
Those soldiers were the ones
who killed the boy's parents?


592
00:50:30.242 --> 00:50:33.786
That's motive. Motive for murder.
Oh God. Revenge.


593
00:50:33.954 --> 00:50:38.082
Yes, but he had known the boy
since he was 5...


594
00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:40.084
...and was a familyfriend.

595
00:50:40.293 --> 00:50:43.796
What about the knife.
Do we know whose it is?


596
00:50:43.964 --> 00:50:45.631
There are initiaIs on it.

597
00:50:45.924 --> 00:50:49.802
No, the initiaIs don't match
anyone in the case.


598
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:52.763
It's a rare knife. ltwas kept at home.

599
00:50:52.931 --> 00:50:55.641
The kid carried itwith him all the time.

600
00:50:55.976 --> 00:51:00.187
His friends saw him with it.
They said all this in court.


601
00:51:00.438 --> 00:51:04.191
They kept saying itwas
an exceptionally rare knife.


602
00:51:04.651 --> 00:51:06.110
Special.

603
00:51:06.361 --> 00:51:09.530
Just listen to what you're suggesting.

604
00:51:09.698 --> 00:51:10.948
What is it?

605
00:51:11.158 --> 00:51:14.285
- Can'tfind it.
- The kid's in the park.


606
00:51:14.452 --> 00:51:16.162
Justwalking, walking...

607
00:51:16.454 --> 00:51:21.625
And suddenly some guy
comes up to him and says:


608
00:51:21.877 --> 00:51:26.922
"Hey kid, do you happen to know
where they sell good knives?"


609
00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:32.386
And he says: "Why, yes! I have
a good knife right here. A very good one.


610
00:51:32.512 --> 00:51:34.847
Rare. Unique. Yes".

611
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:37.141
And he selIs it to him. Yes.

612
00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:42.521
The boy sold him this knife. The man
bought it and went and killed his dad!


613
00:51:43.315 --> 00:51:46.442
It's totally lun-icrous!

614
00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.070
- What?
- "Lud-icrous".


615
00:51:50.405 --> 00:51:51.947
Wait, wait!

616
00:51:52.616 --> 00:51:54.825
What about the money?

617
00:51:55.035 --> 00:51:58.829
Theyfound 7 thousand in his pocket!

618
00:51:58.997 --> 00:52:00.956
The same exact amount as...

619
00:52:01.166 --> 00:52:06.045
...the pension the father received that day.
He didn't sell any knife!


620
00:52:06.171 --> 00:52:09.340
He killed him and robbed him.

621
00:52:09.507 --> 00:52:12.676
There's no sense in listening
to the defendant's lies...


622
00:52:12.844 --> 00:52:16.347
- You can't get another knife like that, guys.
- I found it!


623
00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:20.768
Thank God. The key is tiny,
l thought I lost it.


624
00:52:20.936 --> 00:52:24.230
But itwas hiding
in my pocket. There...


625
00:52:25.273 --> 00:52:29.360
l also thought that the knife
was unique, special.


626
00:52:30.904 --> 00:52:33.614
And that only he had one.

627
00:52:33.782 --> 00:52:35.241
Look.

628
00:52:36.159 --> 00:52:37.618
Here.

629
00:52:45.252 --> 00:52:46.794
One and the same.

630
00:52:47.379 --> 00:52:49.421
With a receipt.

631
00:52:53.426 --> 00:52:57.388
They said it's unique, special
and that only he had one.


632
00:52:57.597 --> 00:53:00.641
At the "Extreme" market
you can get one easily.


633
00:53:11.528 --> 00:53:13.153
So what's that prove?

634
00:53:13.363 --> 00:53:16.365
That the Chechen
didn't kill his father?


635
00:53:16.533 --> 00:53:19.368
No, it proves nothing.
Can we smoke here?


636
00:53:19.536 --> 00:53:22.162
Why not? We're locked in.

637
00:53:22.372 --> 00:53:23.998
- Ashtray.
- May l?


638
00:53:24.207 --> 00:53:28.127
- Thanks. I had a different goal.
- So you found the knife.


639
00:53:28.295 --> 00:53:31.714
- Bought it.
- OK, bought. What's the difference?


640
00:53:31.881 --> 00:53:35.509
These days you can even buy
a missile launcher.


641
00:53:35.677 --> 00:53:38.637
But can you tell me howthat proves...

642
00:53:38.805 --> 00:53:42.891
...that the man who bought the knife
also killed the father?


643
00:53:43.059 --> 00:53:47.396
May l? lt doesn't prove that at all.
You interrupted me before.


644
00:53:49.149 --> 00:53:50.566
Thankyou.

645
00:53:50.775 --> 00:53:53.027
I'm saying that the uniqueness
of the knife was...


646
00:53:53.194 --> 00:53:56.822
...the prosecution's main argument.

647
00:53:56.948 --> 00:53:59.825
But it turns out
you can buy one easily.

648
00:53:59.951 --> 00:54:02.578
So what? What does that mean?

649
00:54:02.787 --> 00:54:08.208
lt means the investigation wasn't very
thorough so otherfacts are possible.


650
00:54:08.335 --> 00:54:13.130
The lawyer. The lawyer. He had nothing to say.
He was an empty man!


651
00:54:13.256 --> 00:54:15.799
He couldn't defend him.

652
00:54:16.009 --> 00:54:18.469
What...? What if...

653
00:54:19.304 --> 00:54:21.680
...the one who bought it is the killer?

654
00:54:22.307 --> 00:54:23.932
Oh, Jesus!

655
00:54:24.434 --> 00:54:28.687
Buddy, why do you have
cottage cheese for brains?


656
00:54:29.189 --> 00:54:31.690
Someone bought it and killed him.

657
00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:34.610
Do you even understand
what you're saying?


658
00:54:34.778 --> 00:54:38.238
Five minutes ago you drew us
a balance sheet.


659
00:54:38.406 --> 00:54:42.284
"He killed and robbed him".
Who else had a reason...


660
00:54:42.452 --> 00:54:44.995
...to kill a majorfor his pension?

661
00:54:45.205 --> 00:54:50.084
lf I were you I'd listen to the comrade
from the TransportAuthority.


662
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:53.921
You know, your reasoning is somehow...

663
00:54:54.089 --> 00:54:55.089
Jewish.

664
00:54:55.507 --> 00:54:59.385
What, I should reason
like the late YasserArafat?


665
00:54:59.552 --> 00:55:02.429
All right. No, well...
Wait a minute. Wait.


666
00:55:02.597 --> 00:55:06.683
OK. So the working guy
said something stupid.


667
00:55:06.851 --> 00:55:11.605
- Why are you supporting him?
- You know, what he said wasn't stupid.


668
00:55:11.731 --> 00:55:14.817
See, that's a typical Jewish trick.

669
00:55:15.318 --> 00:55:18.654
lf a non-Jew says something stupid,
it's OK, but...


670
00:55:18.822 --> 00:55:21.698
...if it's a Jew, it's not stupid.

671
00:55:21.825 --> 00:55:23.117
All right.

672
00:55:23.326 --> 00:55:27.579
The knife, a coincidence. It's the same,
l admit. But the man who bought the knife


673
00:55:27.747 --> 00:55:30.999
used it to kill the father.

674
00:55:31.167 --> 00:55:33.794
Is that also a coincidence?

675
00:55:34.379 --> 00:55:37.548
2 coincidences in a row?
That's impossible.


676
00:55:37.715 --> 00:55:39.842
lt never happens. Never.

677
00:55:40.051 --> 00:55:45.222
You know, for some time now
I've believed that...


678
00:55:46.015 --> 00:55:49.476
...anything is possible in life.
Absolutely anything. Even the impossible.


679
00:55:50.687 --> 00:55:52.354
My dad...

680
00:55:54.107 --> 00:55:56.400
...was in the ghetto during the War.

681
00:55:56.609 --> 00:55:59.987
- A Holocaust story?
- No, it's about my dad.


682
00:56:00.155 --> 00:56:04.491
The headquarters of the
Lithuanian SS was right nearby.


683
00:56:04.659 --> 00:56:09.496
And there was an SS officerthere
who had a beautiful Lithuanian wife.


684
00:56:09.622 --> 00:56:13.500
Now, my dad was a scrawny man.

685
00:56:15.628 --> 00:56:19.673
You see what I look like?
He was three times worse.


686
00:56:19.841 --> 00:56:23.135
And did you inherit your dad's looks?

687
00:56:23.303 --> 00:56:27.639
No, my mom's. Mom was no beauty,
either, but not like dad.


688
00:56:27.765 --> 00:56:31.852
lt made it that much easier
for myfatherto fall in love.


689
00:56:32.395 --> 00:56:36.440
Myfatherfell in love with that
beautiful Lithuanian woman.


690
00:56:36.608 --> 00:56:42.112
And she fell in love with myfather,
like a puppy.


691
00:56:42.238 --> 00:56:46.450
lmagine whatwould've happened
if the Russians had lost.


692
00:56:46.618 --> 00:56:49.411
The SS officerfled to Germany.

693
00:56:49.579 --> 00:56:52.456
And she stayed with my dad.

694
00:56:53.416 --> 00:56:54.666
Oh, God, wow!

695
00:56:55.585 --> 00:57:00.005
Theywere both arrested
and sent to the camps in Siberia.


696
00:57:00.131 --> 00:57:04.384
Theywere released in 1953,
found each other, and got married.


697
00:57:04.552 --> 00:57:07.095
They moved to a little farm
nearVilnius...


698
00:57:07.305 --> 00:57:11.642
...and began to crank out children.
Eleven of them.


699
00:57:12.685 --> 00:57:17.606
By this time, of course, my dad had been
a pig and dumped my mom.


700
00:57:17.732 --> 00:57:19.983
But I understand him.

701
00:57:20.777 --> 00:57:22.486
For one thing...

702
00:57:22.695 --> 00:57:25.155
...l saw her photograph.

703
00:57:32.622 --> 00:57:35.082
l saw her photograph.

704
00:57:38.753 --> 00:57:40.712
And for another...

705
00:57:42.966 --> 00:57:45.592
...my motherwas no angel, either.

706
00:57:48.137 --> 00:57:50.055
Motherwas no angel.

707
00:57:55.311 --> 00:57:57.479
An amazing story.

708
00:58:01.025 --> 00:58:06.071
lf someone told me a story like that,
l wouldn't believe it.


709
00:58:08.575 --> 00:58:11.285
But it happened to my dad.

710
00:58:11.828 --> 00:58:13.912
Anything can happen.

711
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:16.832
Anything.

712
00:58:56.956 --> 00:59:01.960
Stop, stop. I have doubts.
We all tend our gardens in our own way.


713
00:59:02.086 --> 00:59:05.422
And we hold the shovel in our own.

714
00:59:06.257 --> 00:59:10.177
Well... lf you only knew.
l have an uncle.


715
00:59:10.345 --> 00:59:15.057
He lives nearVoronezh, he's a plumber.

716
00:59:15.183 --> 00:59:17.100
Hands of gold!

717
00:59:18.269 --> 00:59:23.315
He's generous and kind.
The whole cityjust loves him.


718
00:59:23.441 --> 00:59:27.110
He likes to drink,
but he's not mean.


719
00:59:27.278 --> 00:59:30.238
He doesn't drink too often.

720
00:59:31.157 --> 00:59:33.700
ln the center oftown

721
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:36.161
there's a square.

722
00:59:36.371 --> 00:59:41.375
They built this place there where
you can play machines for money.


723
00:59:41.501 --> 00:59:44.127
"Brother," it's called. "Brother".

724
00:59:44.295 --> 00:59:49.925
Uncle Kolya had never been a gambler.
But one payday, he got drunk.


725
00:59:50.051 --> 00:59:51.551
And went there.

726
00:59:52.553 --> 00:59:55.847
And, well, he lost.

727
00:59:57.517 --> 00:59:59.726
He lost every cent.

728
01:00:00.269 --> 01:00:03.772
He thinks: "How can I go home now

729
01:00:04.065 --> 01:00:06.566
to Liuba, to mywife, and say:

730
01:00:06.776 --> 01:00:10.862
"Liuba, I lost everything, all the money".
How?"


731
01:00:11.030 --> 01:00:13.657
It'd be easierto hang himself.

732
01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.743
But some kind people told him:

733
01:00:17.203 --> 01:00:21.289
"There's a place nearby
where you can borrow money".


734
01:00:21.457 --> 01:00:26.253
So he goes there and they say:
"OK, we'll give you a loan,


735
01:00:26.379 --> 01:00:32.968
butwith high interest,
and not less than 50 thousand.


736
01:00:33.052 --> 01:00:37.931
So if you want 50 thousand, you got it,
but if not, you can go to hell".


737
01:00:38.057 --> 01:00:39.933
What could he do?

738
01:00:40.143 --> 01:00:43.270
He takes the 50 thousand...

739
01:00:43.438 --> 01:00:47.774
...and goes back to that
"Brother" place, damn it.


740
01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.152
And he...

741
01:00:50.361 --> 01:00:53.155
He loses it all.

742
01:00:54.157 --> 01:00:57.617
The whole 50 thousand.
Now what could he do?


743
01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.537
Now whatwas he going to do?

744
01:01:08.296 --> 01:01:10.088
Middle of the day.

745
01:01:12.258 --> 01:01:14.676
He goes to work, telIs the boss:

746
01:01:14.886 --> 01:01:18.138
"Give me 50 thousand".
"What, are you nuts?"


747
01:01:18.306 --> 01:01:22.893
"Nuts, eh? Just you wait."
He goes home. Gets a shotgun, shells.


748
01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:26.646
And goes back. By this time
the boss had run off some place.


749
01:01:26.814 --> 01:01:30.192
He goes to the accounting office.
There are onlywomen there.


750
01:01:30.318 --> 01:01:33.904
He takes three of them hostage.

751
01:01:34.071 --> 01:01:36.865
He becomes a terrorist.

752
01:01:38.576 --> 01:01:41.953
He makes them put
a bucket outside with a note,


753
01:01:42.121 --> 01:01:45.874
his demands -
all 57 thousand rubles,


754
01:01:47.001 --> 01:01:51.421
a luxury apartment,
ajob as chief engineer,


755
01:01:51.839 --> 01:01:55.300
and a plane to anywhere on earth
he chooses.


756
01:01:55.468 --> 01:01:58.094
Now, why did he askfor ajob,

757
01:01:58.679 --> 01:02:01.932
when he planned to
fly off in a plane?

758
01:02:02.099 --> 01:02:04.893
That's not important.
It's not important.


759
01:02:06.187 --> 01:02:09.940
The women say: "Uncle Kolya,
what are you doing? Look..."


760
01:02:10.441 --> 01:02:13.193
But hejust goes "oooo!"
He can't speak.


761
01:02:13.402 --> 01:02:18.031
The women open the safe
and take out 800 rubles.


762
01:02:18.199 --> 01:02:21.243
One goes to buy vodka,
a half case, ice cream.


763
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:23.995
And the police are there, snipers.

764
01:02:24.205 --> 01:02:26.873
"He's a terrorist! Get him! Fire!"

765
01:02:27.083 --> 01:02:31.837
But the police chief says:
"Stop! Absolutely not! Don't shoot!


766
01:02:32.004 --> 01:02:34.172
I'll go myself!"
What a man!


767
01:02:34.382 --> 01:02:37.175
And he goes in unarmed. What a man!

768
01:02:37.385 --> 01:02:40.053
Uncle Kolya points the gun at him:
"I'll kill you".


769
01:02:40.263 --> 01:02:42.264
And the chief says: "No you won't".

770
01:02:42.473 --> 01:02:47.435
"Why not?"
"Because I'm the chief", says the chief.


771
01:02:47.562 --> 01:02:50.689
Uncle Kolya drops the shotgun.

772
01:02:51.607 --> 01:02:55.277
They sit around the case ofvodka.

773
01:02:56.112 --> 01:02:58.029
They have a drink.

774
01:02:58.281 --> 01:03:00.156
And cry.

775
01:03:01.158 --> 01:03:04.578
And there was no trial, no investigation.

776
01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:24.222
l beg your pardon, butwhy exactly
did you tell us all that?


777
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:29.311
Why? He could have been sent to prison,

778
01:03:29.478 --> 01:03:31.605
or shot. A terrorist!

779
01:03:31.856 --> 01:03:35.775
But the police chief, what a man.
What a man! Nothing.


780
01:03:35.943 --> 01:03:40.572
Uncle Kolya worked and paid off his debt.
l helped a bit.


781
01:03:40.698 --> 01:03:44.242
The police chief moved up.
He became a businessman.


782
01:03:44.452 --> 01:03:47.704
And "Brother" was burned down.

783
01:03:47.914 --> 01:03:50.248
But by someone else,
not Uncle Kolya.


784
01:03:50.458 --> 01:03:52.876
That's wonderful.

785
01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:58.048
Butwhat does all that have to do
with this case?


786
01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:00.800
lf... if...

787
01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:04.763
I'm for kindness.

788
01:04:05.306 --> 01:04:08.266
Your brains sure curdled fast, brother.

789
01:04:08.517 --> 01:04:12.187
No, no.
l don't have cottage cheese up here!


790
01:04:12.355 --> 01:04:15.774
A good man should be helped.

791
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:17.901
And a bad man should be...

792
01:04:21.197 --> 01:04:24.324
l vote that the young Chechen
is not guilty.


793
01:04:24.492 --> 01:04:26.242
Write it down. Thankyou.

794
01:04:27.536 --> 01:04:28.912
Well!

795
01:04:29.705 --> 01:04:31.706
That's amazing!

796
01:04:32.166 --> 01:04:35.418
What kind ofjustice is that?

797
01:04:35.878 --> 01:04:38.880
Uncle Kolya the plumber
runs around drunk.


798
01:04:39.090 --> 01:04:42.634
Uncle Lyosha the police chief
drinks vodka with him.


799
01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:46.888
Uncle Vasya the city prosecutor
turns a blind eye.


800
01:04:47.014 --> 01:04:49.766
And the criminal remains at large!

801
01:04:51.978 --> 01:04:55.105
And meanwhile the entire
civilized world


802
01:04:55.272 --> 01:04:59.109
has lived for centuries
according to the law.


803
01:05:02.488 --> 01:05:05.532
A Russian man will
never live by the law.


804
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:09.285
- Why not?
- The law bores him.


805
01:05:10.913 --> 01:05:12.914
The law is dead.

806
01:05:13.082 --> 01:05:15.667
There's nothing personal about it.

807
01:05:15.876 --> 01:05:20.046
And a Russian man without that
personal touch is an empty shell.


808
01:05:20.214 --> 01:05:22.090
He won't steal or guard.

809
01:05:22.383 --> 01:05:24.467
But that's awful!

810
01:05:24.635 --> 01:05:26.803
Who said itwas good?

811
01:05:26.971 --> 01:05:29.305
Look at that horrible pipe.

812
01:05:30.266 --> 01:05:32.100
It's obscene.

813
01:05:32.268 --> 01:05:34.811
Total filth in the center of Moscow.

814
01:05:35.062 --> 01:05:37.772
ln a school,
where they teach children.


815
01:05:38.024 --> 01:05:41.359
The builders forgot to run
a proper heating pipe,


816
01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:44.029
and then the school was built.

817
01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:47.615
They should cut offtheir limbs
and put them in prison.


818
01:05:47.742 --> 01:05:49.117
By law.

819
01:05:49.326 --> 01:05:54.080
But there are personal ties.
Human ones. Russian ones.


820
01:05:54.248 --> 01:05:59.377
The school let them temporarily
hang that thing. Temporarily.


821
01:05:59.545 --> 01:06:04.674
And it has a corrosive effect
on the minds of the children.


822
01:06:04.842 --> 01:06:08.136
Maybe that's why they leave
their bras in the bathroom.


823
01:06:08.345 --> 01:06:10.764
And nobody gets steamed up.

824
01:06:10.931 --> 01:06:13.475
What's the law got to do with it?

825
01:06:14.351 --> 01:06:16.311
Human relations.

826
01:06:18.064 --> 01:06:20.482
Here! You'll love this.

827
01:06:24.945 --> 01:06:28.615
lnventory number 72-17-99.

828
01:06:28.824 --> 01:06:31.117
Young Eagle Pioneer Camp.

829
01:06:31.285 --> 01:06:33.787
1967.

830
01:06:34.246 --> 01:06:36.164
l wasn't even born then.

831
01:06:37.541 --> 01:06:39.793
Do you see how it is?

832
01:06:40.294 --> 01:06:42.670
40 years have passed. 40 years!

833
01:06:42.838 --> 01:06:45.256
And we still can'twake up
from the coma.


834
01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:49.928
4 decades of running in place.

835
01:06:53.182 --> 01:06:57.227
That's it. I missed my train.
The troupe leftwithout me.


836
01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.355
But I'm here. And I'm voting.

837
01:07:01.357 --> 01:07:04.692
The young Chechen is not guilty.

838
01:07:05.945 --> 01:07:07.695
Write it down. Period.

839
01:07:08.447 --> 01:07:09.948
Shit...

840
01:07:10.116 --> 01:07:12.951
What are you...? Aw, hell!
What did... See what you did?


841
01:07:13.494 --> 01:07:17.997
- This is a circus?
- Actually, I'lljoin them! Write that, too!


842
01:07:18.124 --> 01:07:20.458
Let's alljoin them!

843
01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:24.838
- Wonderful...
- I also think the kid's not guilty!


844
01:07:26.382 --> 01:07:31.386
And, incidentally,
l have reasonable doubts.


845
01:07:31.846 --> 01:07:35.890
Can you explain why

846
01:07:36.016 --> 01:07:39.144
if he killed and robbed
his adoptive father...


847
01:07:40.271 --> 01:07:44.649
...he returned with the money
to the scene of the crime?


848
01:07:44.775 --> 01:07:46.192
Yes, good point.

849
01:07:47.403 --> 01:07:50.155
Atypical murdererwouldn't do that.

850
01:07:50.447 --> 01:07:52.866
Listen, just listen.

851
01:07:53.117 --> 01:07:56.578
OK, you're a respectable man,
a college dean.


852
01:07:56.704 --> 01:08:00.832
How can you say that?
What does "typical murderer" mean?


853
01:08:01.041 --> 01:08:03.293
Atypical one wouldn't go back,
but this one did,


854
01:08:03.836 --> 01:08:06.963
because he's a stupid,
uneducated savage


855
01:08:07.214 --> 01:08:09.465
whojustjumped out of the tree.

856
01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.844
You expect him to write novels?

857
01:08:13.012 --> 01:08:16.723
You know perfectlywell,
those animaIs have tiny little bird brains.


858
01:08:16.932 --> 01:08:18.141
My dear sir...

859
01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:22.103
...excuse me, butjustwho
are you calling a savage?


860
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:24.397
I'm also from the Caucasus,
for example.


861
01:08:24.565 --> 01:08:27.692
So the poet Rustaveli was a savage?

862
01:08:27.902 --> 01:08:31.821
The artist Pirosmani?
Directors like Paradzhanov?


863
01:08:31.989 --> 01:08:34.908
- Who's a savage?
- I don't mean them.


864
01:08:35.117 --> 01:08:39.037
I'm talking about the monster
who killed his father.


865
01:08:39.205 --> 01:08:41.706
I'm talking about myself.

866
01:08:41.874 --> 01:08:45.001
I'm also from the Caucasus.
l studied in Moscow.


867
01:08:45.169 --> 01:08:49.214
But I get called "monkey".
I'm no monkey, I'm a surgeon.


868
01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:53.218
A physician. I have my own clinic.
Understand?


869
01:08:53.344 --> 01:08:57.722
l don't doubt it, OK, so you're not
toiling away at county hospital.


870
01:08:57.932 --> 01:09:02.602
Then why do people come here
from the Caucasus to buy a diploma?


871
01:09:03.354 --> 01:09:05.230
What? To buywhat?

872
01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:08.191
- I bought one?
- I don't mean you.


873
01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:11.736
I'm asking you, wait!
l bought my diploma, yes?


874
01:09:12.655 --> 01:09:16.741
l never paid anyone
to getwhere I am!


875
01:09:16.909 --> 01:09:20.161
How dare you?
What gives you the right, huh?


876
01:09:20.287 --> 01:09:24.499
l tried 4 times before I got into
Moscow Medical School!


877
01:09:24.708 --> 01:09:30.463
And for all 4 years I worked
as an orderly at city hospital! Yes!


878
01:09:30.631 --> 01:09:36.010
l worked as a paramedic and in the ER.
l graduated in honor! "With honors" I mean.


879
01:09:36.178 --> 01:09:39.681
Yes,
so I don't speak Russian thatwell.


880
01:09:39.848 --> 01:09:43.101
So what?
Yes, I said "lun-icrous" by mistake.


881
01:09:43.477 --> 01:09:46.980
So what? I apologized.
I'm still a good doctor!


882
01:09:47.147 --> 01:09:50.191
l don't doubt that you're a good doctor.
But I don't understand why


883
01:09:50.442 --> 01:09:53.444
a good doctor like you
would vote guilty


884
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:57.532
if everyone in the Caucasus
is so cultured...


885
01:09:57.658 --> 01:09:59.993
That's why I voted guilty.

886
01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:03.871
It's an unheard of affront
in the Caucasus


887
01:10:04.081 --> 01:10:06.499
to raise a hand against an elder.

888
01:10:06.667 --> 01:10:09.794
Especially if he tookyou
into his home, his family.


889
01:10:10.754 --> 01:10:12.171
Brothers, brothers...

890
01:10:13.465 --> 01:10:15.383
Gentlemen... Comrades...

891
01:10:15.801 --> 01:10:18.720
Come on, let's be civilized.
For God's sake.


892
01:10:18.846 --> 01:10:21.806
I'm over here writing, plus one,
not guilty, guilty...


893
01:10:22.057 --> 01:10:24.309
...let's be civilized, let's do it again.

894
01:10:24.518 --> 01:10:28.521
Let's all vote calmly.
We'll write everything down so it's clear.


895
01:10:28.772 --> 01:10:32.191
- So let's vote, OK?
- Can we vote by show of hands?


896
01:10:32.318 --> 01:10:34.235
Now. Who votes

897
01:10:34.486 --> 01:10:39.115
to find the accused not guilty?

898
01:10:40.242 --> 01:10:44.787
Not guilty. Please pay attention.
Not guilty.


899
01:10:44.997 --> 01:10:46.372
One,

900
01:10:46.582 --> 01:10:50.251
two, three, four,

901
01:10:50.753 --> 01:10:52.003
five.

902
01:10:52.463 --> 01:10:56.090
Who votes to find the defendant guilty?

903
01:10:57.176 --> 01:11:00.762
One, two, three, four, five,

904
01:11:00.888 --> 01:11:02.388
six...

905
01:11:03.682 --> 01:11:04.891
Seven.

906
01:11:05.059 --> 01:11:06.809
Seven "for"...

907
01:11:07.144 --> 01:11:10.438
Five for "not guilty",
seven for "guilty".


908
01:13:17.483 --> 01:13:22.069
The boundary is here, right?
So it's a mirror image.


909
01:13:22.196 --> 01:13:24.113
Let's reproduce it.

910
01:13:24.281 --> 01:13:29.744
So your amateurtheatre is going to
recreate the crime scene exactly?


911
01:13:29.828 --> 01:13:34.040
Exactly? No, how could we?
One apartmentwas on top of the other.


912
01:13:34.249 --> 01:13:38.920
We'll try to mirror-image them,
according to this floor plan.


913
01:13:39.129 --> 01:13:43.799
Listen, the old man downstairs heard
the boy shout "I'll kill you".


914
01:13:44.009 --> 01:13:48.054
And a falling body
and he sawthe boy run away, right?


915
01:13:48.597 --> 01:13:53.434
Have any of you been
to the scene of the murder?


916
01:13:53.644 --> 01:13:54.936
Of course not.

917
01:13:55.145 --> 01:13:59.440
You know, I have...
l went afterthe first day of the trial...


918
01:13:59.566 --> 01:14:01.359
because I was curious to see

919
01:14:01.985 --> 01:14:06.197
a building where only two apartments
were occupied.


920
01:14:06.406 --> 01:14:10.535
ln one, a murder, in the other,
a witness to the murder.


921
01:14:10.744 --> 01:14:12.161
And nobody else.

922
01:14:12.412 --> 01:14:15.665
What's that got to do
with this case?


923
01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:19.585
Next to the building
there's a construction site.


924
01:14:19.795 --> 01:14:23.839
They're building luxury apartments.
There's lots of machinery.


925
01:14:23.966 --> 01:14:28.010
- Theywork around the clock.
- Around the clock. So what?


926
01:14:28.136 --> 01:14:32.890
lmagine the noise
of a building site outside yourwindow.


927
01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:34.392
Your point?

928
01:14:34.643 --> 01:14:37.937
The old man claims he heard
the boy shout "I'll kill you"


929
01:14:38.146 --> 01:14:43.693
and then he heard something fall,
and he says he recognized the boy's voice.


930
01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:45.444
Yeah, so? What? What?

931
01:14:45.946 --> 01:14:51.242
With all due respect to the witness,
l don't believe him.


932
01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:54.453
Wait. One second.
So you're telling us


933
01:14:54.663 --> 01:14:58.666
that the old man knowingly lied in court,
under oath?


934
01:14:58.834 --> 01:15:01.002
An old-school communist

935
01:15:01.253 --> 01:15:05.214
slandered an innocent Chechen boy
for no reason?


936
01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:09.969
lf anyone lied, under oath and otherwise,
itwas the communists.


937
01:15:10.178 --> 01:15:14.223
They lied from top to bottom,
every one of them.


938
01:15:14.391 --> 01:15:18.144
For privileges, for power,
and just out of habit.


939
01:15:18.353 --> 01:15:21.897
Let's not talk about that, please.

940
01:15:22.107 --> 01:15:24.191
Some people were different.

941
01:15:24.359 --> 01:15:27.486
Myfatherwas a regional party secretary
in the Urals.


942
01:15:27.654 --> 01:15:30.698
Privileges? What privileges?

943
01:15:30.949 --> 01:15:35.369
Sometimes we didn't see him foryears.
His heartwas shot at 50.


944
01:15:35.495 --> 01:15:38.914
After he retired,
he burned outwithin 3 months.


945
01:15:39.124 --> 01:15:42.918
They spit him out like old gum.
Privileges, you say?


946
01:15:43.128 --> 01:15:45.838
How do you think it looks?

947
01:15:46.715 --> 01:15:48.758
- Pretty close.
- Pretty close.


948
01:15:49.217 --> 01:15:53.596
Now, we've created two identical
apartments in mirror image.


949
01:15:53.722 --> 01:15:57.767
As I said, one's on top of the other,
so they're identical.


950
01:15:58.143 --> 01:16:01.020
ln his testimony the old man said

951
01:16:01.396 --> 01:16:04.899
that at the time of the crime
he was lying...


952
01:16:05.734 --> 01:16:09.487
...on the living room sofa...
No, I can't see anything.


953
01:16:09.738 --> 01:16:11.697
I'll ask the bailiff.

954
01:16:18.497 --> 01:16:19.955
What's that?

955
01:16:20.165 --> 01:16:23.292
The train. I'll call you back.

956
01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:32.843
Oh Lord!

957
01:16:37.265 --> 01:16:40.309
- You rang?
- Can you turn on the light?


958
01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:43.104
We need to read. 
It's an experiment.

959
01:16:43.355 --> 01:16:45.272
It's nighttime.

960
01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:49.860
All right, I'll turn it on.

961
01:16:59.579 --> 01:17:01.747
You'll have light.

962
01:17:03.417 --> 01:17:05.251
Yeltsin's fault.

963
01:17:08.213 --> 01:17:09.630
Thankyou.

964
01:17:09.923 --> 01:17:11.132
Thankyou, Boris.

965
01:17:11.425 --> 01:17:14.260
The old man was lying right here
on the sofa.


966
01:17:14.469 --> 01:17:16.470
The crime happened here.

967
01:17:16.722 --> 01:17:21.100
He said his living room is
underthe room where the murderwas.


968
01:17:21.309 --> 01:17:25.271
Did anyone notice howthe old man
walked to the stand?


969
01:17:25.397 --> 01:17:29.608
Yes, I rememberverywell!
He walked slowly, his knees didn't bend.


970
01:17:29.735 --> 01:17:31.569
Because he has arthritis.

971
01:17:31.987 --> 01:17:35.531
The floor plan shows
all the room dimensions.


972
01:17:35.741 --> 01:17:41.287
And we've reproduced them almost exactly,

973
01:17:41.371 --> 01:17:43.456
to see he had to
get up from the sofa,

974
01:17:43.999 --> 01:17:47.960
walk 35 meters, open the door,

975
01:17:48.253 --> 01:17:50.671
and still manage to see someone.

976
01:17:50.881 --> 01:17:55.426
- Anyone know average walking speed?
- A meter and a half per second.


977
01:17:55.635 --> 01:17:58.429
- A meter and a half.
- lf you're healthy.


978
01:17:58.597 --> 01:18:01.307
So, 10 seconds is 15 meters.

979
01:18:01.558 --> 01:18:03.267
So 35 meters is about 25 seconds.

980
01:18:03.477 --> 01:18:08.397
And we'll see which one of us
gets to the doorfirst.


981
01:18:08.774 --> 01:18:11.525
But you have to walk like him.

982
01:18:12.778 --> 01:18:16.697
Pardon me, gentlemen.
l could time you.


983
01:18:16.865 --> 01:18:18.282
- Yes.
- Thankyou very much.


984
01:18:18.492 --> 01:18:19.950
Thankyou, as well.

985
01:18:21.286 --> 01:18:23.537
You're the old man on the sofa.
I'm the criminal.


986
01:18:23.789 --> 01:18:28.000
lt should take you 2 seconds
to get up and find your slippers.


987
01:18:28.126 --> 01:18:30.294
Startwhen I say so.

988
01:18:31.338 --> 01:18:34.131
- Action!
- I'll kill you!


989
01:18:36.843 --> 01:18:39.595
- What's going on?
- Stop, stop.


990
01:18:40.388 --> 01:18:44.099
- Excuse me, you're disturbing us.
- We're working here, see.


991
01:18:44.226 --> 01:18:48.521
No problem. Thankyou.
We're doing an experiment. Sorry.


992
01:18:55.862 --> 01:18:57.404
It's OK. Start again.

993
01:18:57.614 --> 01:19:00.032
Reset the clock to zero.

994
01:19:00.283 --> 01:19:01.659
Zero.

995
01:19:01.868 --> 01:19:03.077
- Ready?
- Yes.


996
01:19:03.495 --> 01:19:04.995
Attention...

997
01:19:06.873 --> 01:19:09.500
- Action!
- I'll kill you!


998
01:19:11.169 --> 01:19:13.420
- Get up.
- OK. There's a noise.


999
01:19:13.588 --> 01:19:15.673
The knife. There are prints.

1000
01:19:15.924 --> 01:19:17.758
Come on, old man, up!

1001
01:19:18.009 --> 01:19:19.844
You hear a noise.
Something's up.


1002
01:19:20.095 --> 01:19:23.514
No, wait.
You have to wipe offthe prints.


1003
01:19:23.682 --> 01:19:26.016
Wipe offthe fingerprints completely.

1004
01:19:26.184 --> 01:19:29.311
Come on, old man, come on.
Let's go, let's go.


1005
01:19:29.479 --> 01:19:31.313
l wipe offthe fingerprints.

1006
01:19:32.107 --> 01:19:35.442
You have to take the money.
You need to find it.


1007
01:19:35.652 --> 01:19:38.070
Old man, come on, come on, let's go!

1008
01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:39.280
Let's go!

1009
01:19:39.573 --> 01:19:42.575
But the boywould know
where the money is.


1010
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:47.371
OK, I lookforthe money.
I'm looking for it.


1011
01:19:47.539 --> 01:19:50.499
l think that's enough time
to find the money.


1012
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:52.334
Don'tforget, put on your coat.

1013
01:19:52.502 --> 01:19:55.546
Come on, old man, something's up,
come on.


1014
01:19:55.714 --> 01:19:58.173
- Someone's shouting.
- Parasites...


1015
01:19:58.341 --> 01:20:01.135
l put on myjacket.
I button it. I walk.

1016
01:20:03.013 --> 01:20:05.264
l walk. I'm in the other room now.

1017
01:20:07.183 --> 01:20:09.268
l open the door, I run.

1018
01:20:10.061 --> 01:20:12.688
l open another door.
I'm in the hall.


1019
01:20:15.984 --> 01:20:19.236
l open the door. 
I'm on the stairs.

1020
01:20:19.362 --> 01:20:22.948
Seven stairs,
three steps on the landing.


1021
01:20:23.033 --> 01:20:25.534
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1022
01:20:26.995 --> 01:20:29.955
The old man's apartment

1023
01:20:34.836 --> 01:20:36.462
I'm outside!

1024
01:20:40.717 --> 01:20:43.093
But he only got
as far as the door.

1025
01:20:43.261 --> 01:20:46.096
Add another 5 seconds for him
to unlock the door.


1026
01:20:47.682 --> 01:20:49.683
53 seconds, gentlemen.

1027
01:20:54.481 --> 01:20:56.190
53 seconds.

1028
01:21:06.618 --> 01:21:08.160
So what?

1029
01:21:11.039 --> 01:21:13.207
Maybe itwas like that.

1030
01:21:14.918 --> 01:21:17.044
And maybe itwasn't.

1031
01:21:18.922 --> 01:21:21.465
The police believed the old man.

1032
01:21:21.633 --> 01:21:26.804
And I believe the police.
The old man sawthe kid running away.


1033
01:21:27.097 --> 01:21:29.765
Or someone else running away.

1034
01:21:29.933 --> 01:21:31.266
Who?

1035
01:21:32.769 --> 01:21:35.437
Someone who wasn't in a hurry.

1036
01:21:35.605 --> 01:21:38.649
Someone who needed to be seen.

1037
01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:42.403
Push up.

1038
01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:46.615
You know, I think...

1039
01:21:47.409 --> 01:21:52.371
...that an old man with
rheumatoid arthritis type 3 FNS 2


1040
01:21:52.455 --> 01:21:55.791
could neverwalk
thatfar in ten seconds.


1041
01:21:55.917 --> 01:21:57.626
l say that as a doctor.

1042
01:21:59.212 --> 01:22:01.505
l want to vote.

1043
01:22:01.923 --> 01:22:05.801
l vote that the boy is not guilty.

1044
01:22:06.136 --> 01:22:07.720
Six - six.

1045
01:22:08.513 --> 01:22:09.722
And...

1046
01:22:12.267 --> 01:22:14.018
Me too.

1047
01:22:16.354 --> 01:22:25.112
Seven -five.

1048
01:24:11.803 --> 01:24:14.179
- What is it?
- I'm cold.


1049
01:24:14.889 --> 01:24:17.933
Cold? We're all cold, pal.

1050
01:24:18.101 --> 01:24:21.436
They gave you double bars.
But you're still cold.


1051
01:24:21.604 --> 01:24:23.397
Deal with it, pal.

1052
01:24:51.509 --> 01:24:56.096
"A birch, a rowan tree"

1053
01:24:56.848 --> 01:25:00.976
"Awillow on the river bank"

1054
01:25:01.436 --> 01:25:03.020
So, actor...

1055
01:25:03.188 --> 01:25:06.106
Your squad went to earn
some lootwithout you?


1056
01:25:06.274 --> 01:25:08.483
We call it "cleaning up".

1057
01:25:08.985 --> 01:25:11.987
"- Where could you find..."
- You performed here.


1058
01:25:12.322 --> 01:25:15.908
- Forfree, though.
- That's called a "command performance".


1059
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:21.997
Did you switch sides as ajoke?

1060
01:25:22.165 --> 01:25:24.583
That's called "buffoonery".
Catch!


1061
01:25:27.712 --> 01:25:30.339
You... Hey. Sorry, l...

1062
01:25:33.676 --> 01:25:36.720
l didn't mean to.
l thought you'd catch it.


1063
01:25:39.432 --> 01:25:40.933
Listen...

1064
01:25:45.438 --> 01:25:46.897
Listen.

1065
01:25:47.065 --> 01:25:48.982
Listen, you.

1066
01:25:50.318 --> 01:25:53.612
Why are you always
talking to me like that?


1067
01:25:53.738 --> 01:25:55.072
l said sorry. OK...

1068
01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.574
Why do you do it?
Do we know each other?


1069
01:25:57.742 --> 01:25:59.576
Did we playfootball...

1070
01:25:59.744 --> 01:26:02.079
...or drink vodka or chase girls?

1071
01:26:02.288 --> 01:26:05.332
- What? Huh?
- And why do you always cackle?


1072
01:26:05.458 --> 01:26:07.918
- Who cackles?
- You cackle. Why?


1073
01:26:08.419 --> 01:26:11.463
- Who cackles?
- You. All the time. Always cackling.


1074
01:26:11.631 --> 01:26:14.549
Whywould I cackle?
We've been here 5 hours.


1075
01:26:14.759 --> 01:26:16.468
You found yourself a clown, eh?

1076
01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:20.430
What am l, a clown to you?
A cheap clown?


1077
01:26:20.598 --> 01:26:22.432
I'm sick of your laughter!

1078
01:26:22.642 --> 01:26:26.728
You've all turned blue from cackling,
like you were strangled.


1079
01:26:27.021 --> 01:26:29.356
You always want to laugh.

1080
01:26:29.524 --> 01:26:33.986
You think it's funny.
You laugh everywhere at everything!


1081
01:26:34.570 --> 01:26:39.241
Before you even sit in your seat
you're readywith your cackle.


1082
01:26:39.367 --> 01:26:41.576
You laugh at absolutely everything!

1083
01:26:41.744 --> 01:26:44.579
Life. Death. Tsunami.

1084
01:26:44.747 --> 01:26:47.874
Earthquakes! And you cackle!

1085
01:26:48.209 --> 01:26:50.335
Halfthe country's freezing...

1086
01:26:50.503 --> 01:26:54.881
A cop murders someone...
Five million homeless orphans...


1087
01:26:57.176 --> 01:27:00.762
Why are you laughing?
Why the "ha ha ha"?


1088
01:27:00.972 --> 01:27:03.890
Because being serious terrifies you.

1089
01:27:04.851 --> 01:27:06.977
Not long ago...

1090
01:27:07.437 --> 01:27:12.107
...l was performing and I started
to talk to the audience seriously.


1091
01:27:12.859 --> 01:27:15.986
About my life,
about life in Russia.


1092
01:27:16.612 --> 01:27:18.655
Everyone laughed.

1093
01:27:18.823 --> 01:27:21.575
They thought itwas ajoke.

1094
01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:25.120
l bet if I were to spit

1095
01:27:25.371 --> 01:27:28.498
from the stage onto the first row,

1096
01:27:28.833 --> 01:27:33.378
they'd still laugh,
they'd think itwas ajoke.


1097
01:27:36.382 --> 01:27:38.884
Found yourself a clown?

1098
01:27:39.218 --> 01:27:41.386
I'm no clown.

1099
01:27:41.554 --> 01:27:44.598
I've only really earned one smile.

1100
01:27:45.183 --> 01:27:47.642
One single smile.

1101
01:27:49.604 --> 01:27:53.440
When I was playing that old man.

1102
01:27:57.153 --> 01:28:01.156
As a kid, I stayed alone a lot
with my sick grandma.


1103
01:28:03.785 --> 01:28:06.661
l was five or six, yeah, six.

1104
01:28:08.623 --> 01:28:12.501
She collapsed.
l could tell she was dying.


1105
01:28:14.253 --> 01:28:17.756
l called an ambulance,
but it tookforever.


1106
01:28:18.424 --> 01:28:20.509
l gave her medicine.

1107
01:28:22.637 --> 01:28:24.596
l was terrified.

1108
01:28:26.182 --> 01:28:28.892
She was my grandmother, after all.

1109
01:28:29.060 --> 01:28:31.686
l decided to cheer her up.

1110
01:28:32.021 --> 01:28:34.773
l started imitating
her neighbor, Sima,


1111
01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:38.318
and anotherfriend of hers.
Theywere both veryfunny.


1112
01:28:38.778 --> 01:28:43.865
Grandma was in a lot of pain
but I saw her smile.


1113
01:28:47.370 --> 01:28:53.041
Even when theywere carrying her body
out, I saw a smile on herface.


1114
01:28:55.586 --> 01:28:57.504
All that...

1115
01:28:58.631 --> 01:29:00.298
...laughter...

1116
01:29:02.927 --> 01:29:04.761
...and a smile.

1117
01:29:10.810 --> 01:29:13.228
And that Chechen kid...

1118
01:29:16.107 --> 01:29:17.983
The old man...

1119
01:29:21.237 --> 01:29:24.281
l could feel in my bones...

1120
01:29:25.616 --> 01:29:27.784
...their horrible fear...

1121
01:29:30.079 --> 01:29:31.580
...and loneliness.

1122
01:29:31.747 --> 01:29:36.126
Same as when I was with my grandmother
while she was dying.


1123
01:29:40.089 --> 01:29:42.924
Thatwas the only smile

1124
01:29:43.384 --> 01:29:45.927
l ever really earned.

1125
01:29:46.929 --> 01:29:49.264
Good thing there are mats.

1126
01:29:49.432 --> 01:29:52.017
l could've broken my back.

1127
01:30:25.801 --> 01:30:28.929
What a Russian story.

1128
01:30:34.977 --> 01:30:36.311
Yeah.

1129
01:30:37.313 --> 01:30:41.650
Everything here is very Russian somehow.
It's not Harvard.


1130
01:30:42.276 --> 01:30:44.236
Yes. It's not Harvard.

1131
01:30:46.989 --> 01:30:49.199
Really got to you, huh?

1132
01:30:51.077 --> 01:30:53.453
Hey, let's do one more experiment.

1133
01:30:54.539 --> 01:30:59.584
You did an experiment.
l justwant to check one thing.


1134
01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:03.088
Now, just imagine...

1135
01:31:04.131 --> 01:31:06.091
You have an imagination, right?

1136
01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:07.509
Me?

1137
01:31:07.969 --> 01:31:11.888
It's not bad. It's...
It's part of my profession.


1138
01:31:12.098 --> 01:31:14.432
Naturally! Yeah!
Now, imagine...


1139
01:31:15.434 --> 01:31:17.435
...you're coming home.

1140
01:31:17.979 --> 01:31:20.021
Late at night.

1141
01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:22.357
- Are you married?
- I am.


1142
01:31:22.942 --> 01:31:24.359
Hold this, please.

1143
01:31:24.527 --> 01:31:27.320
- Do you have kids?
- Yes. A little girl.


1144
01:31:27.697 --> 01:31:30.657
- What kind of car?
- An Audi-80.


1145
01:31:31.784 --> 01:31:35.453
So, imagine that you're coming home
late one night.


1146
01:31:36.289 --> 01:31:39.249
You live in a good area,
nice building, right?


1147
01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:43.003
With a concierge, security cameras,
and everything,


1148
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:47.299
secure parking lot,
a gate, a guard.


1149
01:31:47.967 --> 01:31:49.718
l have a keychain alarm.

1150
01:31:49.885 --> 01:31:52.220
Kolya the guard...

1151
01:31:52.388 --> 01:31:54.556
His name is Kolya.

1152
01:31:54.724 --> 01:31:56.474
Uncle Petya the custodian.

1153
01:31:56.642 --> 01:31:58.393
- Uncle Valera.
- Uncle Valera.


1154
01:31:58.561 --> 01:32:02.439
- Hi, Uncle Valera.
- You knowthem, and they knowyou.


1155
01:32:02.565 --> 01:32:04.691
You're not afraid.
Not at all.


1156
01:32:04.859 --> 01:32:06.610
It's your home.

1157
01:32:06.777 --> 01:32:09.279
Yourverywell-guarded home.

1158
01:32:09.488 --> 01:32:13.241
And so, you parkyourwheels
in the usual place


1159
01:32:13.367 --> 01:32:16.369
and suddenlyyou notice
something's wrong.


1160
01:32:16.495 --> 01:32:19.873
- What's wrong?
- The light's on in yourwindow.


1161
01:32:19.999 --> 01:32:23.752
They're usually asleep by now,
but the light's on.


1162
01:32:23.878 --> 01:32:25.962
So? Maybe theywaited up.

1163
01:32:26.130 --> 01:32:29.132
Of course.
They decided to wait up for you.


1164
01:32:29.258 --> 01:32:32.135
But there's a noise
so you askValera.


1165
01:32:32.303 --> 01:32:34.846
"Everything OK?"

1166
01:32:35.014 --> 01:32:36.848
He says: "Yes, it's fine".

1167
01:32:37.016 --> 01:32:40.894
You go in.
Auntie Polya, the concierge, smiles.


1168
01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.854
Everything's fine.

1169
01:32:43.022 --> 01:32:44.689
Just listen.

1170
01:32:46.525 --> 01:32:49.653
You go to the elevator.
You live on the fifth floor, right?


1171
01:32:49.820 --> 01:32:54.240
Right. How did you know?
l really do live on the fifth floor.


1172
01:32:55.368 --> 01:32:57.577
Of course you do.

1173
01:32:57.745 --> 01:33:00.789
It's the best one.
Not too high, not too low.


1174
01:33:00.956 --> 01:33:02.874
And it has a good view.

1175
01:33:03.125 --> 01:33:05.377
Butwhy aren't they asleep?

1176
01:33:05.544 --> 01:33:10.090
Why? You'll see the surprise
they've made for you.


1177
01:33:10.216 --> 01:33:13.343
Here it is, fifth floor. "Fifth floor".

1178
01:33:13.469 --> 01:33:16.012
It's a woman's voice:
"Fifth floor".


1179
01:33:17.807 --> 01:33:22.018
Oh, those little scamps,
they're not asleep.


1180
01:33:22.144 --> 01:33:24.479
They're waiting for dad.

1181
01:33:24.647 --> 01:33:26.731
They have a surprise for him.

1182
01:33:26.899 --> 01:33:29.943
- I open the door.
- You open the door.


1183
01:33:30.111 --> 01:33:31.528
Wipe yOur feet.

1184
01:33:32.738 --> 01:33:34.698
Did you wipe them?

1185
01:33:34.907 --> 01:33:37.575
- And it's quiet.
- What's quiet?


1186
01:33:37.743 --> 01:33:41.913
The apartment, very quiet.
It's never been so quiet.


1187
01:33:42.164 --> 01:33:43.790
And the lights.

1188
01:33:43.999 --> 01:33:47.293
Lights are on everywhere.
Things are scattered.


1189
01:33:47.461 --> 01:33:49.838
A child's slipper. Just one.

1190
01:33:50.005 --> 01:33:51.965
A large bath towel.

1191
01:33:52.133 --> 01:33:54.968
On the floor.
You know what's going on.


1192
01:33:55.136 --> 01:33:57.178
You call them.
Please, an answer.


1193
01:33:57.430 --> 01:34:00.557
"Please let them answer".
But they're silent.


1194
01:34:00.725 --> 01:34:03.226
The emergency phone
is on the right.


1195
01:34:03.436 --> 01:34:05.520
- On the left.
- Sorry, left.


1196
01:34:05.688 --> 01:34:10.650
The cord's torn out, the receiver's
on the floor. You turn around slowly...


1197
01:34:10.776 --> 01:34:12.902
- And... There it is!
- What?


1198
01:34:13.070 --> 01:34:15.405
There!
Blood underthe door.


1199
01:34:15.614 --> 01:34:18.241
lt opens.
On the chandelier hangs...


1200
01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:25.248
A panda.

1201
01:34:26.208 --> 01:34:28.084
A big stuffed panda.

1202
01:34:28.252 --> 01:34:31.171
Your daughter's favorite.
And it's not blood.


1203
01:34:31.338 --> 01:34:33.256
It's a broken wine bottle.

1204
01:34:33.424 --> 01:34:36.342
All is not lost.
You run to the bedroom.


1205
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:40.221
And here they are!
Your daughter. She looks alive.


1206
01:34:40.389 --> 01:34:42.849
No blood. She was strangled!

1207
01:34:43.017 --> 01:34:47.228
You open the bedroom, and there,
raped and hacked to pieces...


1208
01:34:47.354 --> 01:34:49.314
...is yourwife.
It's the end.


1209
01:34:49.482 --> 01:34:52.275
You want to yell, to run,
but you can't.


1210
01:34:52.443 --> 01:34:54.611
You stand like pillar of salt.

1211
01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:56.738
Overtheir bodies.

1212
01:34:56.906 --> 01:35:00.033
- He's nuts. Nuts.
- Wait. That's not all.


1213
01:35:00.159 --> 01:35:02.494
You hear someone behind you.

1214
01:35:02.661 --> 01:35:04.871
Who could it be?

1215
01:35:05.039 --> 01:35:09.959
It's that same Chechen
that you want to save from prison.


1216
01:35:10.085 --> 01:35:11.628
With the same knife.

1217
01:35:11.796 --> 01:35:17.175
He slowly, methodically
pins you belly down to the floor,


1218
01:35:17.426 --> 01:35:19.511
pulIs backyour head,

1219
01:35:19.678 --> 01:35:24.432
takes that cold, sharp blade
and cuts yourthroatfrom earto ear.


1220
01:35:30.815 --> 01:35:34.317
You, Harvard, will crawl
in your own blood.


1221
01:35:34.485 --> 01:35:37.195
With your last breath...

1222
01:35:37.404 --> 01:35:40.448
You don't understand why he did it!

1223
01:35:41.617 --> 01:35:43.117
He did it because we're

1224
01:35:43.327 --> 01:35:45.078
just trophies to them!

1225
01:35:45.246 --> 01:35:47.539
We're not humans, we're trophies!

1226
01:35:54.630 --> 01:35:57.507
l change my vote. 
The killer is guilty.

1227
01:36:07.226 --> 01:36:09.185
Good for you!

1228
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:14.524
And good for your mom, too.
What a guy she raised.


1229
01:36:14.650 --> 01:36:17.235
Smart. Lively.

1230
01:36:17.945 --> 01:36:20.822
lmaginative. And truthful.

1231
01:36:27.872 --> 01:36:29.455
There you go.

1232
01:36:31.417 --> 01:36:33.042
Six - six.

1233
01:36:34.879 --> 01:36:36.921
Very interesting.

1234
01:37:33.062 --> 01:37:35.563
Why are you looking at me?

1235
01:37:36.690 --> 01:37:38.483
l don't know...

1236
01:37:39.276 --> 01:37:41.486
He's impressionable.

1237
01:37:43.572 --> 01:37:46.699
He's sick.
Should we call the bailiff?


1238
01:37:46.825 --> 01:37:50.203
- Doctor...
- What can I do?


1239
01:37:50.704 --> 01:37:52.330
It's not...

1240
01:37:52.498 --> 01:37:54.707
...food poisoning...

1241
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:59.963
It's nervous regurgitation.

1242
01:38:00.464 --> 01:38:02.882
Give him some water.

1243
01:38:51.223 --> 01:38:54.350
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. Thanks very much...


1244
01:39:02.026 --> 01:39:03.818
Yes. Yes...

1245
01:39:22.504 --> 01:39:24.714
"The City Wolves".

1246
01:39:24.882 --> 01:39:26.632
Season seven finale.

1247
01:39:26.842 --> 01:39:29.260
That's right. I watched it.

1248
01:39:30.345 --> 01:39:34.599
Every Monday through Thursday at 9:35 pm
You watch our channel.


1249
01:39:34.725 --> 01:39:36.392
I'm glad.

1250
01:39:36.602 --> 01:39:38.144
Thankyou.

1251
01:39:50.532 --> 01:39:52.075
Don't shoot!

1252
01:39:53.994 --> 01:39:55.787
Everyone back! Back!

1253
01:39:57.998 --> 01:39:59.999
Stay back, I said!

1254
01:40:01.043 --> 01:40:04.462
Don't shoot! Staywhere you are!
l said don't shoot!


1255
01:40:05.589 --> 01:40:06.923
Quiet!

1256
01:40:07.674 --> 01:40:09.008
Quiet.

1257
01:40:09.426 --> 01:40:11.636
Followthe car!

1258
01:40:13.013 --> 01:40:15.098
Anywounded?

1259
01:40:15.724 --> 01:40:18.768
- No, nobody.
- Good.


1260
01:40:20.562 --> 01:40:22.063
Umar.

1261
01:40:22.356 --> 01:40:23.856
Hey, Umar.

1262
01:40:24.024 --> 01:40:25.650
Is that you?

1263
01:40:26.235 --> 01:40:28.528
It's me, uncle Volodya.

1264
01:40:29.571 --> 01:40:31.364
Calm down. Don't be afraid.

1265
01:40:34.076 --> 01:40:35.535
Get up.

1266
01:40:37.704 --> 01:40:39.705
I'm uncle Volodya.

1267
01:40:42.126 --> 01:40:43.251
Get up.

1268
01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:46.295
Calm down, calm down.

1269
01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:51.717
Umar.

1270
01:40:54.346 --> 01:40:56.305
Calm down.

1271
01:40:57.975 --> 01:41:00.143
Thank God I found you.

1272
01:41:00.686 --> 01:41:04.856
Everything's OK now.
You'll come live with me in Moscow.


1273
01:41:27.546 --> 01:41:29.922
Don't be afraid, it's me.

1274
01:41:30.632 --> 01:41:32.175
Lord...

1275
01:41:33.385 --> 01:41:37.430
You see, we have new lights,
but old wiring.


1276
01:41:37.556 --> 01:41:40.933
It's freezing.
And juries rarely sit this long.


1277
01:41:41.059 --> 01:41:44.604
The wiring can't take it.
I'll give you a lantern.


1278
01:41:44.730 --> 01:41:47.773
Don'tworry,
we'll think of something.


1279
01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:49.025
Fine.

1280
01:41:58.076 --> 01:42:00.661
- Here it is.
- What happened?


1281
01:42:00.829 --> 01:42:03.206
l think I understand:
The old man's address!


1282
01:42:04.166 --> 01:42:08.461
When he gave his statement
he gave one address,


1283
01:42:08.587 --> 01:42:11.464
the building where
the murder happened.


1284
01:42:11.632 --> 01:42:16.761
But in court he gave
a different address, his daughter's.


1285
01:42:17.054 --> 01:42:18.888
Yes, he said... Ow!

1286
01:42:19.056 --> 01:42:20.264
Sorry.

1287
01:42:20.432 --> 01:42:23.559
He said that
the day afterthe murder


1288
01:42:23.727 --> 01:42:27.313
he went to his daughter's
on the other side of Moscow.


1289
01:42:27.439 --> 01:42:30.566
And stayed.
So he lives there now?


1290
01:42:30.692 --> 01:42:32.109
That's right.

1291
01:42:32.277 --> 01:42:35.488
He said he went there
for her birthday.


1292
01:42:35.614 --> 01:42:37.782
But the murder

1293
01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:41.327
and his change of address
were in November?


1294
01:42:41.453 --> 01:42:42.662
Yes.

1295
01:42:42.871 --> 01:42:45.373
But the daughter's birthday

1296
01:42:46.083 --> 01:42:47.500
is in March.

1297
01:42:47.751 --> 01:42:51.170
- Some light, please.
- Sure, here you go.


1298
01:42:51.505 --> 01:42:54.006
And what does all this mean?

1299
01:42:54.174 --> 01:42:55.424
Light.

1300
01:42:55.634 --> 01:42:59.011
I'll explain.
l asked our bailiff


1301
01:42:59.137 --> 01:43:03.516
to bring me some information about
the construction next to the building.


1302
01:43:04.309 --> 01:43:09.230
It's a huge project,
a luxury apartment building.


1303
01:43:09.648 --> 01:43:12.400
One square meter

1304
01:43:12.567 --> 01:43:15.486
costs at least 4000 dollars.

1305
01:43:15.654 --> 01:43:17.822
All the apartments are sold.

1306
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:22.368
But the building where the murder happened
stands rightwhere


1307
01:43:22.536 --> 01:43:26.914
they plan to build a wing
of the luxury building.


1308
01:43:27.749 --> 01:43:30.418
The construction schedule is firm.

1309
01:43:30.585 --> 01:43:31.711
And?

1310
01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:35.339
Now imagine you have to
build a building


1311
01:43:35.465 --> 01:43:38.509
where people have paid millions
for apartments.


1312
01:43:38.719 --> 01:43:42.972
But two old jerks
who aren'tworth a penny


1313
01:43:43.098 --> 01:43:45.141
won't let you start construction.

1314
01:43:45.475 --> 01:43:48.394
It's a public building.
It's central.


1315
01:43:48.603 --> 01:43:52.565
The late officer stayed

1316
01:43:52.733 --> 01:43:56.902
because it had been military housing
but he had no right to stay there.


1317
01:43:57.070 --> 01:44:00.114
But the military didn't have any other
apartmentfor him.


1318
01:44:00.532 --> 01:44:03.576
And the stubborn old partyworker,

1319
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:06.412
wouldn't leave

1320
01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:10.750
because he demanded an equally good
apartment, and also central.


1321
01:44:11.251 --> 01:44:15.171
ln cases like that thejob is done
on a personal level.


1322
01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.716
They send lawyers, building agents.

1323
01:44:18.842 --> 01:44:22.053
They call themselves
anything they like,


1324
01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:24.722
but really they'rejust crooks.

1325
01:44:25.432 --> 01:44:29.602
And these thugs go after
the military man


1326
01:44:29.728 --> 01:44:32.605
who fought against them in the war.

1327
01:44:32.773 --> 01:44:34.899
And afterthe old communist

1328
01:44:35.108 --> 01:44:38.152
who has no idea
what kind of people they are.


1329
01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:42.573
And so they cook up a
lucrative scheme.


1330
01:44:43.492 --> 01:44:45.576
They start surveillance.

1331
01:44:46.495 --> 01:44:49.121
Study the relationships.

1332
01:44:49.289 --> 01:44:51.624
See howthey all interact.

1333
01:44:52.334 --> 01:44:54.543
And waitfortheir moment.

1334
01:44:55.170 --> 01:44:56.629
As a result:

1335
01:44:56.880 --> 01:44:59.090
One person is killed,

1336
01:44:59.716 --> 01:45:02.468
another, who did not kill anyone,

1337
01:45:02.636 --> 01:45:04.762
is sent to prison,

1338
01:45:05.555 --> 01:45:10.393
the third runs offto his daughter's
on the other side of Moscow.


1339
01:45:10.519 --> 01:45:13.646
And within a few days is living there...

1340
01:45:14.981 --> 01:45:16.816
...permanently.

1341
01:45:19.111 --> 01:45:20.569
ltwas...

1342
01:45:21.196 --> 01:45:23.656
...a very lucrative scheme.

1343
01:45:23.824 --> 01:45:25.199
So...

1344
01:45:26.451 --> 01:45:30.079
...you're saying itwas a
premeditated murder?


1345
01:45:32.541 --> 01:45:34.291
Looks thatway.

1346
01:45:34.501 --> 01:45:36.752
But that's horrible!

1347
01:45:39.798 --> 01:45:41.298
Well...

1348
01:45:42.175 --> 01:45:45.970
...when millions of dollars
are at stake...


1349
01:45:47.305 --> 01:45:51.016
...the difference between persuasion...

1350
01:45:51.393 --> 01:45:53.477
...and execution...

1351
01:45:54.688 --> 01:45:56.313
...disappears.

1352
01:45:56.565 --> 01:45:59.150
How do you know all this?

1353
01:46:07.159 --> 01:46:10.077
l say, how do you know all this?

1354
01:46:14.374 --> 01:46:16.250
People talk.

1355
01:46:17.836 --> 01:46:20.212
Pass the candle, please.

1356
01:46:20.547 --> 01:46:21.922
Over here.

1357
01:46:23.884 --> 01:46:28.721
So, youjust told us
all ofthat, and...


1358
01:46:31.057 --> 01:46:32.892
...and what now?

1359
01:46:33.852 --> 01:46:36.687
I'm convinced that the boy

1360
01:46:37.731 --> 01:46:40.232
did not kill his father.

1361
01:46:40.817 --> 01:46:42.151
l vote.

1362
01:46:42.777 --> 01:46:44.153
Not guilty.

1363
01:46:47.073 --> 01:46:48.657
Back to seven -five.

1364
01:46:52.162 --> 01:46:56.707
I'll admit that yourwild theory,
so to speak, is possible.


1365
01:46:56.875 --> 01:47:01.629
But you're forgetting the otherwitness,
in the next building.


1366
01:47:01.755 --> 01:47:06.175
Herwindows are across from
the room where the murder happened.


1367
01:47:06.301 --> 01:47:10.971
And she testified that she saw
with her own eyes howthe father...


1368
01:47:11.097 --> 01:47:15.142
"The father hit the boy in the face,
and then...


1369
01:47:15.268 --> 01:47:18.687
...the Chechen grabbed a knife
and stuck it...


1370
01:47:18.813 --> 01:47:21.315
...into the chest of the officer, Volodya".

1371
01:47:22.359 --> 01:47:25.778
She had no reason to give
false testimony.


1372
01:47:25.904 --> 01:47:28.697
Nobodywanted to tear down her building.

1373
01:47:28.907 --> 01:47:33.118
Don't trust her! Thatwoman
not only claimed she sawthe murder.


1374
01:47:33.245 --> 01:47:36.914
She demonstrated
how he stabbed from above.


1375
01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.165
Yes?
Yes, she did.


1376
01:47:38.833 --> 01:47:43.212
Before I went to med school
l worked as an orderly.


1377
01:47:43.547 --> 01:47:46.298
l saw lots of knife wounds.

1378
01:47:46.466 --> 01:47:52.388
How could a kid who's
a head shorterthan his father.


1379
01:47:52.514 --> 01:47:56.725
How could he stab him
from above?


1380
01:47:56.851 --> 01:47:59.228
What is this, a Bollywood movie?

1381
01:47:59.688 --> 01:48:02.356
It's nonsense.

1382
01:48:04.818 --> 01:48:07.069
It'sjust ridiculous. Listen...

1383
01:48:07.612 --> 01:48:09.989
...what're you babbling about?

1384
01:48:10.156 --> 01:48:14.702
l don't get it. A "Bollywood movie"?
That's nonsense!


1385
01:48:14.995 --> 01:48:19.039
I've never been an orderly.
Do you want me to showyou...


1386
01:48:19.165 --> 01:48:22.918
...how a person can stab someone
a head tallerfrom above?


1387
01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.965
Want me to showyou?

1388
01:48:28.508 --> 01:48:29.800
Do you?

1389
01:48:32.971 --> 01:48:34.888
Go ahead, if you can...

1390
01:48:35.056 --> 01:48:37.766
- You want me to?
- Go ahead.


1391
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:39.852
All right.

1392
01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:41.395
Look.

1393
01:48:46.026 --> 01:48:49.820
Come here.

1394
01:48:50.238 --> 01:48:52.990
How did he do it? I'll showyou.

1395
01:48:53.575 --> 01:48:55.451
Come here. There.

1396
01:48:56.453 --> 01:48:57.745
Where...?

1397
01:48:59.080 --> 01:49:00.456
Come here.

1398
01:49:03.835 --> 01:49:06.337
How'd he do it? Watch.

1399
01:49:06.963 --> 01:49:08.881
Come here. Watch. Watch.

1400
01:49:17.807 --> 01:49:20.517
There. Like that.

1401
01:49:26.024 --> 01:49:27.149
Stop.

1402
01:49:27.359 --> 01:49:29.109
Am I shorterthan you?

1403
01:49:29.277 --> 01:49:32.071
Shorter by a head? Well? Am l?

1404
01:49:32.739 --> 01:49:36.116
Shorter, right?
I'm a head shorterthan you.


1405
01:49:38.119 --> 01:49:40.245
Bollywood, you say?

1406
01:49:41.456 --> 01:49:43.666
How could he do it?

1407
01:49:47.045 --> 01:49:48.545
I'll showyou.

1408
01:49:49.047 --> 01:49:51.465
I'll showyou how he could do it.

1409
01:49:58.223 --> 01:50:00.599
His father hit him.

1410
01:50:04.646 --> 01:50:07.231
lnsulted him and hit him.
He took the knife.


1411
01:50:09.067 --> 01:50:10.693
I'll kill you!

1412
01:50:23.623 --> 01:50:25.499
Whatwas that?

1413
01:50:26.876 --> 01:50:28.877
Is it blood?

1414
01:50:36.594 --> 01:50:37.970
The bird...

1415
01:50:38.972 --> 01:50:40.764
...pooped.

1416
01:50:42.934 --> 01:50:45.102
Let me have the knife.

1417
01:50:48.022 --> 01:50:49.606
You know?

1418
01:50:50.775 --> 01:50:56.196
The boy grew up in a land where
they know something about knives.


1419
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:04.204
Anyone who's ever used
a knife knows


1420
01:51:05.331 --> 01:51:07.207
you have to strike from below.

1421
01:51:07.417 --> 01:51:11.712
It's always unpredictable.
Always dangerous,


1422
01:51:11.838 --> 01:51:14.506
and always hard to defend against.
Like this.


1423
01:51:15.967 --> 01:51:18.761
What are you...?

1424
01:51:20.722 --> 01:51:23.223
Then, to be sure the knife

1425
01:51:23.475 --> 01:51:27.770
reaches the heart,
as the medical expert said...


1426
01:51:27.937 --> 01:51:31.607
...you must strike with power,
penetrate the chest cavity.


1427
01:51:34.694 --> 01:51:36.028
Hey, stop...

1428
01:51:36.279 --> 01:51:38.572
You're a surgeon.

1429
01:51:39.240 --> 01:51:41.533
Yes, a surgeon. 
Can't you tell?

1430
01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.286
A knife...

1431
01:51:44.954 --> 01:51:48.791
...like any otherweapon,
especially in the Caucasus,


1432
01:51:49.125 --> 01:51:51.710
is a form of culture.

1433
01:52:28.832 --> 01:52:30.332
Sorry...

1434
01:52:30.708 --> 01:52:33.836
...l learned itwhen I was a kid,
in the Caucasus.


1435
01:52:34.712 --> 01:52:35.712
Sorry.

1436
01:52:36.589 --> 01:52:38.465
Very interesting.

1437
01:52:44.556 --> 01:52:46.640
l change my decision.

1438
01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:48.976
Oh Lord, I'm blind.

1439
01:53:10.748 --> 01:53:14.459
l can't talk now.
l can't talk now, you hear?


1440
01:53:15.712 --> 01:53:17.921
They're still deliberating.

1441
01:53:18.089 --> 01:53:20.173
Can you imagine?

1442
01:53:20.425 --> 01:53:22.050
All night. lmagine that...

1443
01:53:22.510 --> 01:53:25.345
Got some real g0-getters.
Is it myfault?


1444
01:53:26.973 --> 01:53:31.810
Since ourwiring is totally shot
this is the best I can do,


1445
01:53:32.103 --> 01:53:34.479
it's left overfrom a school dance.

1446
01:53:34.647 --> 01:53:38.400
- A karaoke party...
- I'll take the lantern.


1447
01:53:39.152 --> 01:53:41.403
lf you did yourjob,
you'd be home.


1448
01:53:41.571 --> 01:53:45.365
You'd be at a disco or a
karaoke bar like normal people.


1449
01:53:45.491 --> 01:53:47.576
l propose we vote.

1450
01:53:49.495 --> 01:53:54.041
The gentleman builder is right,
it's a very logical plan.


1451
01:53:54.167 --> 01:53:56.710
l think the kid is not guilty.

1452
01:53:57.128 --> 01:54:02.132
Please raise your hand if you
think the accused is guilty.


1453
01:54:04.636 --> 01:54:06.762
One. Two.

1454
01:54:06.971 --> 01:54:08.430
Three.

1455
01:54:10.767 --> 01:54:15.187
Please raise your hand if
you think he is not guilty.


1456
01:54:15.772 --> 01:54:17.189
One, two, three,

1457
01:54:17.565 --> 01:54:21.151
four, five six, seven, eight.

1458
01:54:23.571 --> 01:54:25.530
And you?

1459
01:54:27.158 --> 01:54:28.367
Sorry.

1460
01:54:28.576 --> 01:54:30.452
Are you...?
What?


1461
01:54:31.287 --> 01:54:33.789
- How do you vote?
- Meaning?


1462
01:54:34.499 --> 01:54:38.877
You said you change your mind.
What are you changing it to?


1463
01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.339
One second.

1464
01:54:44.092 --> 01:54:48.553
Pardon me, but do you recall
how I voted the last time?


1465
01:54:50.014 --> 01:54:53.392
Ah, when you...?
You voted guilty.


1466
01:54:53.810 --> 01:54:55.769
Thankyou very much.

1467
01:54:55.979 --> 01:54:59.773
Yes, I definitely change my mind.

1468
01:55:00.858 --> 01:55:04.820
And vote that the accused
is not guilty.


1469
01:55:05.238 --> 01:55:08.490
You won't change again?
l can write...?


1470
01:55:08.658 --> 01:55:11.868
What do you mean?
It's myfinal decision.


1471
01:55:11.995 --> 01:55:13.662
Based on principle.

1472
01:55:13.871 --> 01:55:16.289
Thanks to principles like that

1473
01:55:16.457 --> 01:55:18.542
we'll wake up one day

1474
01:55:19.085 --> 01:55:22.504
surrounded by green berets
restoring order,


1475
01:55:23.339 --> 01:55:26.008
and foreign speech.

1476
01:55:26.259 --> 01:55:30.220
l don't understand why
you're insulting me.


1477
01:55:30.346 --> 01:55:33.557
You changed your mind
just like I did.


1478
01:55:33.725 --> 01:55:36.184
No, pal, not like you did.

1479
01:55:36.352 --> 01:55:40.272
Hejust described a very clear plan,
and how itworks.


1480
01:55:40.398 --> 01:55:42.441
It's one criminal scheme.

1481
01:55:42.608 --> 01:55:45.861
It's notjust one.
The scheme is everywhere.


1482
01:55:46.404 --> 01:55:47.946
What scheme?

1483
01:55:48.781 --> 01:55:52.242
When the big fish don't
give a thought to the little people,


1484
01:55:53.161 --> 01:55:57.080
who have to get by
howeverthey can.


1485
01:55:57.498 --> 01:55:59.249
By their own rules.

1486
01:56:00.168 --> 01:56:01.668
It's like that everywhere.

1487
01:56:01.961 --> 01:56:04.463
ln construction, in hospitals,

1488
01:56:04.756 --> 01:56:06.214
and in cemeteries.

1489
01:56:06.424 --> 01:56:08.884
What do cemeteries
have to do with it?


1490
01:56:10.303 --> 01:56:12.554
Have you ever buried anyone?

1491
01:56:13.222 --> 01:56:14.556
Me?

1492
01:56:15.975 --> 01:56:17.601
Yes, I have.

1493
01:56:20.605 --> 01:56:24.232
Two years ago.
ln London. Matilda.


1494
01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.734
Who was she?

1495
01:56:28.154 --> 01:56:29.863
A Rottweiler.

1496
01:56:30.406 --> 01:56:33.450
That's not a name.
It's a breed of dog.


1497
01:56:34.202 --> 01:56:37.162
l don't know howthey bury dogs
in London,


1498
01:56:37.330 --> 01:56:40.791
but I do know how we see people off
on theirfinaljourney.


1499
01:56:40.958 --> 01:56:45.712
I've been a cemetery directorfor 8 years.
Now, imagine this.


1500
01:56:45.797 --> 01:56:50.258
You're burying a loved one.
Afuneral service, the usual.


1501
01:56:50.384 --> 01:56:52.427
You go to the graveyard.

1502
01:56:52.637 --> 01:56:55.347
- Like this.
- What are you...? What grave?


1503
01:56:55.556 --> 01:56:57.307
- That's mom.
- Sorry.


1504
01:56:57.517 --> 01:56:59.392
My mom's there.

1505
01:56:59.602 --> 01:57:02.062
- Well, it's...
- My mom.


1506
01:57:02.772 --> 01:57:05.398
The final farewell, relatives.

1507
01:57:05.608 --> 01:57:08.985
And some old lady standing nearby.

1508
01:57:09.153 --> 01:57:11.988
She looks into the grave
and says "Oh God, that poor man".


1509
01:57:12.198 --> 01:57:16.076
They say "What is it?"
They look, the grave's flooded.


1510
01:57:16.452 --> 01:57:17.994
How can that be?

1511
01:57:18.162 --> 01:57:22.541
What can they do? You can't
put your loved one in a swamp.


1512
01:57:22.834 --> 01:57:25.043
And the old grannywhispers advice.

1513
01:57:25.545 --> 01:57:29.297
They go to the head gravedigger,
who's there.


1514
01:57:30.049 --> 01:57:33.927
They say: "Sir, there's water in there.
Please do something".


1515
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:38.306
He gives them some line
about ground water


1516
01:57:38.432 --> 01:57:41.017
and he shoveIs the liquid
out of the grave.


1517
01:57:41.185 --> 01:57:43.728
But it runs back in. 
They're in shock.

1518
01:57:43.896 --> 01:57:48.942
The old lady tugs at someone's sleeve
and shows them another grave nearby,


1519
01:57:49.318 --> 01:57:51.736
that's completely dry.

1520
01:57:51.946 --> 01:57:53.488
And pristine.

1521
01:57:53.865 --> 01:57:56.366
Now here's the interesting part.

1522
01:57:56.659 --> 01:57:59.786
The relatives ask the digger,

1523
01:57:59.954 --> 01:58:03.290
"Listen is there anyway
we can change places?"


1524
01:58:03.708 --> 01:58:05.333
"Are you crazy?"

1525
01:58:06.085 --> 01:58:09.462
They're burying someone there
in 15 minutes.


1526
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:12.299
No way. All the paperwork's done"

1527
01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:18.513
They get on their knees, in tears;,
"Sir, please help us. We'll pay.


1528
01:58:18.598 --> 01:58:20.307
Just tell us how much".

1529
01:58:20.516 --> 01:58:23.935
The rest is easy.
He looks at their clothes.


1530
01:58:24.061 --> 01:58:26.646
for you, 2000 bucks.

1531
01:58:27.398 --> 01:58:31.651
For someone else, 500. lfthey're poor
he won't even look at them.


1532
01:58:32.653 --> 01:58:37.282
They swap stones.
The dead guy gets a dry grave


1533
01:58:37.408 --> 01:58:41.578
The family leaves.
The old lady gets 500 rubles


1534
01:58:42.121 --> 01:58:45.957
They pull out the plastic sheetfrom
underthe grave


1535
01:58:46.375 --> 01:58:49.085
and in 15 minutes it's dry.

1536
01:58:50.379 --> 01:58:54.633
And the diggers are ready
to rig up anotherwet grave.


1537
01:58:55.885 --> 01:58:57.802
That's it.

1538
01:59:08.773 --> 01:59:11.983
I'm glad we cremated
my mother in law.


1539
01:59:16.447 --> 01:59:18.698
Very interesting.

1540
01:59:24.538 --> 01:59:27.499
Why are you looking at me?

1541
01:59:29.752 --> 01:59:32.671
Is it differentwhere you work?

1542
01:59:35.258 --> 01:59:38.218
Everyone's in on it. Everyone.

1543
01:59:38.844 --> 01:59:41.137
ln their own way.

1544
01:59:41.555 --> 01:59:43.014
Right, friend?

1545
01:59:46.727 --> 01:59:48.270
Rolex?

1546
01:59:48.688 --> 01:59:50.272
Yeah.

1547
01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:52.691
Expensive.

1548
01:59:55.069 --> 01:59:56.069
Well, yeah.

1549
01:59:56.279 --> 01:59:58.071
On your cemetery pay?

1550
02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:02.617
Yes...

1551
02:00:04.453 --> 02:00:07.747
...on my cemetery pay. I won't lie

1552
02:00:09.083 --> 02:00:11.876
But I also used that cemetery pay

1553
02:00:12.044 --> 02:00:14.629
to restore the chapel.

1554
02:00:14.797 --> 02:00:18.508
And I feed the bums who
hang around the cemetery.


1555
02:00:18.634 --> 02:00:21.177
They have to eat somewhere.

1556
02:00:22.054 --> 02:00:26.641
And I built a school in the town
where I was born, 830 km from Moscow.


1557
02:00:28.686 --> 02:00:31.354
lt has a gym... come visit,
you'll see.


1558
02:00:31.522 --> 02:00:35.191
And we don't have monstrosities,
like that pipe.


1559
02:00:35.318 --> 02:00:38.236
My pipes are underground,
where they should be.


1560
02:00:38.404 --> 02:00:43.033
There's a computer lab with
LCD screens.


1561
02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:47.203
Local teachers, all with
good salaries.


1562
02:00:48.331 --> 02:00:51.666
We have a bus to bring kids
from farther away.


1563
02:00:51.792 --> 02:00:54.002
And take them home, of course.

1564
02:00:54.170 --> 02:00:57.422
So they don't have time
to sniff glue.


1565
02:00:59.342 --> 02:01:02.969
And if you ask
the people in the village:


1566
02:01:03.763 --> 02:01:08.058
"Where'd the money to build this
school come from?"


1567
02:01:11.062 --> 02:01:15.565
They couldn't care less where
the money came from,


1568
02:01:16.609 --> 02:01:19.652
as long as the school stays
up and running.


1569
02:01:19.779 --> 02:01:23.698
So I use moneyfrom the dead
to help the living.


1570
02:01:24.158 --> 02:01:26.826
Since nobody else is going to.

1571
02:01:36.128 --> 02:01:39.172
ln short, the Chechen is not guilty.

1572
02:01:41.967 --> 02:01:44.302
Still, can you explain to me,

1573
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:48.932
an almost sane person,
why that simple woman,


1574
02:01:49.058 --> 02:01:51.017
who is not part of any scheme,

1575
02:01:51.185 --> 02:01:54.229
testified in court
that the Chechen


1576
02:01:54.355 --> 02:01:57.148
killed the Russian officer
Volodya with a knife?


1577
02:01:57.358 --> 02:01:59.401
l know why.

1578
02:02:00.027 --> 02:02:03.947
You can yell at me.
You can laugh. But I know.


1579
02:02:04.323 --> 02:02:07.033
- ltwasjealousy.
- What?


1580
02:02:09.203 --> 02:02:11.204
Jealousy,

1581
02:02:11.747 --> 02:02:15.708
She didn't hearthe boy,
she lives across the street.


1582
02:02:15.835 --> 02:02:19.963
She didn't see anything either
because itwas night time.


1583
02:02:20.089 --> 02:02:24.342
At best, she saw some shadows,
though I doubt it.


1584
02:02:24.468 --> 02:02:26.261
She didn't see anything.

1585
02:02:26.429 --> 02:02:29.472
She was convinced that itwas the boy
and no one else,


1586
02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:32.559
because she wanted
and was prepared to see


1587
02:02:32.726 --> 02:02:35.770
the worst in him.

1588
02:02:35.896 --> 02:02:37.313
Why?

1589
02:02:38.816 --> 02:02:40.316
Jealousy.

1590
02:02:40.484 --> 02:02:42.068
Terrible,

1591
02:02:42.486 --> 02:02:44.237
senseless, femalejealousy.

1592
02:02:44.780 --> 02:02:46.364
Look at these photos.

1593
02:02:46.574 --> 02:02:48.867
She showed them in court.

1594
02:02:49.952 --> 02:02:52.996
To prove that she knewthe victim.

1595
02:02:53.622 --> 02:02:56.458
Here's a photo of them at a party.

1596
02:02:56.625 --> 02:02:58.877
Her, the deceased, and his wife.

1597
02:02:59.044 --> 02:03:00.753
Now here's one...

1598
02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:06.384
...of her, him, and someone's arm.

1599
02:03:06.635 --> 02:03:08.636
It's his wife's arm.

1600
02:03:08.888 --> 02:03:13.141
Why did she need to go
and crop the photo


1601
02:03:13.267 --> 02:03:15.226
so it only shows her
and the deceased?


1602
02:03:15.519 --> 02:03:17.729
Cutting out the wife.

1603
02:03:19.106 --> 02:03:21.983
This is a photo of her dream.

1604
02:03:22.318 --> 02:03:25.695
What happens next is very simple:

1605
02:03:25.821 --> 02:03:27.155
A single woman,

1606
02:03:27.406 --> 02:03:32.368
childless, who dreams offinally
having her own family.


1607
02:03:32.495 --> 02:03:36.331
She likes the man from across the street,
but he's married.


1608
02:03:36.540 --> 02:03:40.793
She writes him in Chechnya,
telIs him his wife's cheating.


1609
02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:42.921
- Can I see?
- Sure, here.


1610
02:03:43.088 --> 02:03:47.008
And that she's sorry,
but she couldn't keep quiet.


1611
02:03:47.134 --> 02:03:50.803
True or not,
she did write him the letter.


1612
02:03:51.388 --> 02:03:53.139
ltwasjealousy.

1613
02:03:53.307 --> 02:03:56.518
She engineered his divorce.

1614
02:03:56.644 --> 02:03:58.186
Thatwas it!

1615
02:03:58.354 --> 02:04:02.357
No more obstacles.
Just her and him, like the photo.


1616
02:04:02.483 --> 02:04:05.276
All she had to do was
waitfor his return.


1617
02:04:05.486 --> 02:04:08.112
The return of her beloved.

1618
02:04:08.697 --> 02:04:11.282
And he arrives, but not alone.

1619
02:04:11.450 --> 02:04:14.994
He's with a nasty, filthy
savage monkey


1620
02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:17.413
who can hardly speak Russian.

1621
02:04:17.623 --> 02:04:22.752
Remember, she said she asked him
what his plans were?


1622
02:04:23.504 --> 02:04:25.296
And hejust replied

1623
02:04:25.464 --> 02:04:29.551
that he planned to live with the kid
and take care of him.


1624
02:04:29.677 --> 02:04:32.512
Thatwas it. All her hopes, ruined.

1625
02:04:32.763 --> 02:04:34.764
But she kept it up.

1626
02:04:34.932 --> 02:04:38.351
Remember, she said she invited him over.

1627
02:04:38.477 --> 02:04:40.311
With the boy. For her birthday.

1628
02:04:40.479 --> 02:04:44.399
She made dinner, bought sweets,
and a book.


1629
02:04:45.234 --> 02:04:48.444
Later she discovered
that some moneywas missing


1630
02:04:48.571 --> 02:04:52.615
from next to where
that poor boywas sitting.


1631
02:04:53.576 --> 02:04:56.619
And she tried to convince him
to return it.


1632
02:04:57.705 --> 02:05:01.040
Eventually she admitted in court
that she had put it somewhere else


1633
02:05:01.458 --> 02:05:04.919
and forgot.

1634
02:05:05.796 --> 02:05:08.631
But, at the time, she mentions
the money


1635
02:05:08.799 --> 02:05:12.302
in front of a combat vet
who'd been wounded.


1636
02:05:12.428 --> 02:05:15.638
She must have known
what could happen.


1637
02:05:15.764 --> 02:05:17.807
And did happen, of course.

1638
02:05:17.975 --> 02:05:22.270
The man hears that the kid
he considers his son is a thief.


1639
02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:25.023
And he loses control of himself.

1640
02:05:25.649 --> 02:05:28.026
He smacks the boy, but she's silent.

1641
02:05:28.235 --> 02:05:31.613
And when his nose bleeds

1642
02:05:31.739 --> 02:05:34.866
she leaps to his defense
and says the boy's innocent.


1643
02:05:35.034 --> 02:05:38.161
Or rather, he's guilty,
but shouldn't be hit.


1644
02:05:38.287 --> 02:05:41.831
Because children are weaker,
you shouldn't hurt them.


1645
02:05:47.254 --> 02:05:48.838
God!

1646
02:05:50.841 --> 02:05:52.675
She didn't lie.

1647
02:05:52.843 --> 02:05:55.470
She wanted to believe

1648
02:05:55.971 --> 02:05:59.098
the murdererwas the boy

1649
02:06:00.059 --> 02:06:02.101
and no one else.

1650
02:06:03.979 --> 02:06:05.438
Jealousy.

1651
02:06:07.232 --> 02:06:09.317
Senseless, cruel,

1652
02:06:10.319 --> 02:06:13.237
blind, instinctive

1653
02:06:14.782 --> 02:06:16.866
femalejealousy.

1654
02:06:20.329 --> 02:06:22.038
That's it.

1655
02:06:23.248 --> 02:06:24.832
Right there.

1656
02:06:25.501 --> 02:06:28.503
She found the money later,
she said so herself.


1657
02:06:33.258 --> 02:06:34.884
l live with my son.

1658
02:06:35.052 --> 02:06:38.846
He's twenty now, but back then, in"91
he was six.


1659
02:06:39.890 --> 02:06:43.309
ln 1990 mywife left me.

1660
02:06:45.354 --> 02:06:48.940
She ran offwith a guyfrom the States.
The hell with her...


1661
02:06:49.358 --> 02:06:53.903
The kid was upset, of course,
but I explained that momjustwent


1662
02:06:54.988 --> 02:06:58.116
on a long trip, and that
he'd see her again.


1663
02:06:58.242 --> 02:07:01.035
My mom looked after him.

1664
02:07:01.662 --> 02:07:05.331
l had started driving a cab,
working like a dog.


1665
02:07:08.085 --> 02:07:10.878
Didn't really think about myfamily.

1666
02:07:11.255 --> 02:07:14.006
Women are no problem for a cabbie.

1667
02:07:14.174 --> 02:07:15.717
One day...

1668
02:07:16.343 --> 02:07:20.179
...l started talking to this woman.
Not a beauty


1669
02:07:20.556 --> 02:07:24.767
We went out a couple oftimes,
and she came to live with us.


1670
02:07:26.395 --> 02:07:30.314
l didn't need much from her:

1671
02:07:30.441 --> 02:07:33.860
Meals, laundry, take the kid to school.
She seemed to like himjustfine.


1672
02:07:35.028 --> 02:07:36.946
Kolya. Little Nikolai.

1673
02:07:40.033 --> 02:07:43.703
Forthe life of me, I can't remember
how it started.


1674
02:07:49.501 --> 02:07:53.004
She began to tell me things
about my boy...


1675
02:07:53.422 --> 02:07:57.133
...that he was lazy,
that he misbehaved.


1676
02:07:57.259 --> 02:08:00.303
l call him over and ask:
"Is it true?"


1677
02:08:00.471 --> 02:08:05.975
He looks at me, smiling,
and says: "Yes, dad." And hides his eyes.


1678
02:08:06.727 --> 02:08:08.811
l punished him.

1679
02:08:11.690 --> 02:08:16.903
One day I'd had enough,
l don't rememberwhat she told me


1680
02:08:16.987 --> 02:08:20.364
but I just snapped.

1681
02:08:20.491 --> 02:08:22.742
l busted into his room

1682
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:25.953
dragged him out of bed,
punched him.


1683
02:08:26.121 --> 02:08:29.499
She's quiet.
Then her nose starts bleeding.


1684
02:08:29.625 --> 02:08:31.542
She screams.

1685
02:08:31.710 --> 02:08:36.464
"Murderer! Murderer! What are you doing?!
You're killing the child!"


1686
02:08:37.257 --> 02:08:39.217
And it started.

1687
02:08:39.885 --> 02:08:41.803
I'd beat him...

1688
02:08:43.347 --> 02:08:46.140
She'd see the blood and scream.

1689
02:08:46.308 --> 02:08:48.768
ltwas brutal.

1690
02:08:49.895 --> 02:08:55.024
And my boy, itwas as if
he was expecting it.


1691
02:08:55.108 --> 02:08:58.444
He stopped crying.
He'd just blink and smile,


1692
02:08:58.570 --> 02:09:01.113
blink over and over, but not cry.
He didn't cry.


1693
02:09:01.281 --> 02:09:05.284
l punch him.
His face is bloody.


1694
02:09:05.410 --> 02:09:08.454
And he keeps blinking and smiling.

1695
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:12.124
Blinking and smiling.

1696
02:09:16.547 --> 02:09:18.673
One night I woke up.

1697
02:09:22.344 --> 02:09:24.679
l heard water running.

1698
02:09:25.180 --> 02:09:28.099
l go to the bathroom,
he's washing his sheet


1699
02:09:28.267 --> 02:09:30.935
He had pissed his bed.

1700
02:09:31.520 --> 02:09:32.979
That kid...

1701
02:09:33.438 --> 02:09:36.357
He sat in the corner
hugging the sheet.


1702
02:09:36.483 --> 02:09:39.402
Looking at me and smiling.
Smiling.


1703
02:09:39.570 --> 02:09:42.363
Blinking and smiling.

1704
02:09:45.534 --> 02:09:48.244
ltwas like he was always guilty.

1705
02:09:48.412 --> 02:09:51.539
That look, and that smile.
He'd look at me...


1706
02:09:51.665 --> 02:09:54.041
And I was right in a way,

1707
02:09:54.209 --> 02:09:56.752
But in my soul, deep down...

1708
02:09:58.630 --> 02:10:02.800
ltwas like someone made me
my own son's executioner.


1709
02:10:03.427 --> 02:10:05.928
Then she had a baby, also a boy.

1710
02:10:06.096 --> 02:10:10.224
He was aboutfour.
He acted up in front of me.


1711
02:10:10.350 --> 02:10:12.643
l gave him a little smack.

1712
02:10:12.811 --> 02:10:16.480
And bam!
God help me...


1713
02:10:16.982 --> 02:10:20.776
l barely got away. She threw an iron,
itjust missed me.


1714
02:10:25.324 --> 02:10:27.491
l could slug my own son,

1715
02:10:27.659 --> 02:10:32.163
but I just barely touched hers,
and she nearly killed me.


1716
02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:40.838
She and the kid went to
her relatives in Tambov.


1717
02:10:45.719 --> 02:10:47.970
l was working nights.

1718
02:10:48.138 --> 02:10:51.974
l had already left the building
when I turned around.


1719
02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:55.978
ltwas like someone grabbed me
by the collar.


1720
02:10:56.104 --> 02:11:00.316
l saw a light in the window.
l ran to the apartment.


1721
02:11:00.609 --> 02:11:03.027
l look all over, can'tfind him.
It's 3am.


1722
02:11:03.195 --> 02:11:05.529
l hear a rustling in the closet.

1723
02:11:05.697 --> 02:11:07.448
l open the closet.

1724
02:11:08.283 --> 02:11:12.828
And he's sitting there.
Smiling and looking at me.


1725
02:11:13.455 --> 02:11:16.707
And blinking.
Blinking, over and over.


1726
02:11:17.334 --> 02:11:21.545
l say: "Son, what are you doing?"
l pull him out of the closet.


1727
02:11:21.672 --> 02:11:23.923
l hold him. He holds me tight.

1728
02:11:24.091 --> 02:11:29.011
He looks at me, smiling and blinking,
and he's got something behind his back.


1729
02:11:29.429 --> 02:11:32.473
l say: "Son, what's that?"

1730
02:11:32.641 --> 02:11:36.477
And I take his hand.
Like that. His hand.


1731
02:11:42.859 --> 02:11:45.778
And he's holding a noose.

1732
02:11:48.740 --> 02:11:51.575
A noose he made from my belt.

1733
02:11:59.001 --> 02:12:01.168
l don't know...

1734
02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:04.171
...what he saw on myface.

1735
02:12:04.339 --> 02:12:08.009
But he grabbed me, hugged me,
pressed himselftight.


1736
02:12:09.344 --> 02:12:13.222
And whispered:
"Papa, don't, papa".


1737
02:12:14.224 --> 02:12:17.643
"Papa, don't, don't".
Over and over.


1738
02:12:17.769 --> 02:12:21.188
"Don't, papa, don't".
And he's smiling.


1739
02:12:21.648 --> 02:12:24.859
Smiling and saying: "Papa, don't".

1740
02:12:50.510 --> 02:12:52.303
Well...

1741
02:12:52.471 --> 02:12:54.096
...l vote...

1742
02:12:55.098 --> 02:12:57.016
...the kid is not guilty.

1743
02:12:57.684 --> 02:12:59.393
Write it down.

1744
02:12:59.561 --> 02:13:00.561
Yes, you know,

1745
02:13:00.812 --> 02:13:04.732
thatwas very persuasive.

1746
02:13:05.776 --> 02:13:08.360
l agree, the boy is not guilty.

1747
02:13:08.570 --> 02:13:10.696
- Let's vote.
- OK, fine.


1748
02:13:10.864 --> 02:13:13.741
Who thinks he is not guilty,
raise your hand.


1749
02:13:17.579 --> 02:13:20.915
- Thank God.
- Finally, thankyou.


1750
02:13:21.583 --> 02:13:24.210
It's unanimous, he's not guilty.

1751
02:13:24.377 --> 02:13:26.629
Wait. Let's write it down.

1752
02:13:28.757 --> 02:13:31.383
Wait, please. Wait.

1753
02:13:31.927 --> 02:13:34.637
Justwait.

1754
02:13:35.639 --> 02:13:37.723
l haven't voted yet.

1755
02:13:37.891 --> 02:13:40.935
- Well, I hope you'lljoin us.
- No.


1756
02:13:43.855 --> 02:13:45.648
l think

1757
02:13:46.066 --> 02:13:48.234
he's guilty.

1758
02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:53.030
Eleven for "not guilty"
and one for "guilty".


1759
02:13:53.532 --> 02:13:57.409
- Listen!
- I'll explain, I'll explain.


1760
02:13:57.536 --> 02:13:59.829
- These artists...
- Why?


1761
02:14:01.665 --> 02:14:04.542
- Come on...
- I don't get it.


1762
02:14:04.709 --> 02:14:07.545
We only hurt the ones we love...

1763
02:14:13.468 --> 02:14:15.928
l knewfrom the first minute

1764
02:14:16.096 --> 02:14:18.180
that he was innocent.

1765
02:14:19.975 --> 02:14:21.934
Professional experience.

1766
02:14:22.102 --> 02:14:26.105
l agree with all the explanations
we've come up with here.


1767
02:14:26.231 --> 02:14:28.983
The old man was obviously scared.

1768
02:14:29.401 --> 02:14:32.611
And the woman...
You forgot that she's nearsighted.


1769
02:14:32.737 --> 02:14:36.782
She wears glasses. And she claimed
she was sleeping that night.


1770
02:14:36.908 --> 02:14:40.494
She had to put on her glasses
and go to the window.


1771
02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:42.580
It's not realistic.

1772
02:14:42.747 --> 02:14:47.334
And the boy, well, he's from the Caucasus.
They're very different people.


1773
02:14:47.878 --> 02:14:52.423
l worked there a fewtimes,
l knowthem.


1774
02:14:52.549 --> 02:14:55.259
He wouldn'tyell "I'll kill you!",
he'd just kill you.


1775
02:14:55.427 --> 02:15:00.181
And he wouldn't make up
a stupid story.


1776
02:15:01.349 --> 02:15:05.394
The rest is obvious.
ltwas clearly a set up.


1777
02:15:06.062 --> 02:15:07.771
Arranged by people

1778
02:15:07.981 --> 02:15:12.026
who really need the kid
to go to prison. Right?


1779
02:15:12.152 --> 02:15:14.778
We sawthat. We proved that
he's innocent.


1780
02:15:14.988 --> 02:15:16.280
Right?

1781
02:15:16.489 --> 02:15:18.282
But as soon as

1782
02:15:20.535 --> 02:15:24.288
we reach that verdict,
they'll let him go.


1783
02:15:24.456 --> 02:15:26.332
Of course theywill. And?

1784
02:15:26.541 --> 02:15:28.792
- That's great.
- And thank God.


1785
02:15:29.753 --> 02:15:32.296
Yes, thank God he's not a murderer.

1786
02:15:32.505 --> 02:15:37.843
Then what? Why did you
vote to find him guilty?


1787
02:15:38.178 --> 02:15:40.471
l don't understand at all.

1788
02:15:40.639 --> 02:15:44.725
l have ceased to understand anything.
We finally... You...


1789
02:15:45.268 --> 02:15:47.186
l just don't understand anymore.

1790
02:15:47.354 --> 02:15:50.147
After all we've gone through.
Me, for instance


1791
02:15:50.357 --> 02:15:52.483
And when... I'm sorry.
When we all...


1792
02:15:52.692 --> 02:15:55.069
And you... What is this?

1793
02:15:55.278 --> 02:15:59.073
We've accomplished a great thing,
an arduous task.


1794
02:15:59.199 --> 02:16:01.158
We've established the truth.

1795
02:16:01.368 --> 02:16:03.452
l can say one thing for sure.

1796
02:16:03.620 --> 02:16:08.207
He'll live longer in prison,
than he will on the street.


1797
02:16:08.333 --> 02:16:10.167
Very interesting.

1798
02:16:10.418 --> 02:16:14.797
lf he gets out now, he won't go to
a bar or home, orto relatives.


1799
02:16:15.382 --> 02:16:18.217
He has nothing, nobody, understand?

1800
02:16:18.426 --> 02:16:20.844
He'll lookforthe killers.

1801
02:16:21.012 --> 02:16:24.598
Also, ifwe acquit him now,

1802
02:16:24.724 --> 02:16:29.937
itwill automatically trigger
an investigation into the unsolved murder.


1803
02:16:30.021 --> 02:16:33.148
The men who killed his father

1804
02:16:33.608 --> 02:16:36.652
will be on guard,
and they'll lookforthe kid.


1805
02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:38.696
He'll lookforthem.

1806
02:16:38.905 --> 02:16:43.117
And they'll lookfor him,
but he doesn't know where they are.


1807
02:16:43.285 --> 02:16:45.786
But they know where he is.

1808
02:16:45.954 --> 02:16:51.125
So our decision, instead of sending
the kid to prison


1809
02:16:51.209 --> 02:16:53.836
will be his death warrant.

1810
02:16:54.004 --> 02:16:57.548
And they'll kill him crudely, horribly.

1811
02:16:58.008 --> 02:17:01.218
Like a dog, with a sharpened screwdriver...

1812
02:17:01.344 --> 02:17:04.847
And nobodywill lookfor him.
You knowthat.


1813
02:17:04.973 --> 02:17:10.144
They'll find him 8 or 10 months later
in a sewer or a garbage dump.


1814
02:17:10.228 --> 02:17:11.520
And that's it.

1815
02:17:11.730 --> 02:17:15.566
There are people in the courtroom

1816
02:17:15.692 --> 02:17:19.278
following every step of the trial.

1817
02:17:19.821 --> 02:17:24.116
l can smell it.
Professional instinct.


1818
02:17:24.326 --> 02:17:25.576
Understand?

1819
02:17:25.827 --> 02:17:27.745
- An artist's instinct
- What?


1820
02:17:27.954 --> 02:17:29.663
An artist's.

1821
02:17:30.415 --> 02:17:31.540
Yes, an artist's.

1822
02:17:31.916 --> 02:17:34.877
What if he hangs himself in prison?

1823
02:17:37.130 --> 02:17:40.174
How do we know what'll
happen to him in there?


1824
02:17:40.467 --> 02:17:42.676
How will he act?
How can we know?


1825
02:17:47.515 --> 02:17:50.100
Well, then, that's his fate...

1826
02:17:52.312 --> 02:17:54.646
...if he hangs himself.

1827
02:17:55.523 --> 02:17:57.941
But I'll tell you one thing for sure.

1828
02:17:58.109 --> 02:18:02.571
He'll live longer
in prison than he will on the street.


1829
02:18:02.822 --> 02:18:07.034
OK, then what do you suggest?

1830
02:18:07.744 --> 02:18:11.080
Are you proposing we let
an innocent man sit in prison


1831
02:18:11.247 --> 02:18:12.956
while the criminaIs go free?

1832
02:18:13.166 --> 02:18:15.667
- Exactly.
- I didn't propose that.


1833
02:18:15.919 --> 02:18:20.464
Hide him away in prison:
He has nowhere else to go, anyway.


1834
02:18:20.965 --> 02:18:24.635
His home was torn down.
He has nowhere to live.


1835
02:18:24.719 --> 02:18:28.555
We'll hire lawyers.
We can get some money together.


1836
02:18:28.681 --> 02:18:31.809
We'll go to the prosecutor.
We'll find professionals.


1837
02:18:31.935 --> 02:18:36.772
And tell them whatwe know.
They'll nail the killers to the wall.


1838
02:18:36.856 --> 02:18:40.984
Then, when they're locked up,
the kid can be let out.


1839
02:18:41.111 --> 02:18:43.821
And then he'll be free and safe.
From them, anyway.


1840
02:18:44.072 --> 02:18:47.199
You'll excuse me, but, these lawyers,

1841
02:18:47.367 --> 02:18:51.328
these professional people,
that prosecutor...


1842
02:18:51.454 --> 02:18:54.790
Who's going to handle all ofthat?
I'm curious.


1843
02:18:57.127 --> 02:18:59.461
Who? What do you mean, who?

1844
02:18:59.629 --> 02:19:00.629
Who?

1845
02:19:00.839 --> 02:19:02.673
We will. Who else?

1846
02:19:03.800 --> 02:19:05.008
Us?

1847
02:19:05.552 --> 02:19:08.387
Who else has any use

1848
02:19:08.763 --> 02:19:12.724
for a poor Chechen boywho
doesn't speak Russian


1849
02:19:13.601 --> 02:19:16.061
and was accused of killing his father?

1850
02:19:16.229 --> 02:19:20.441
Who's going to handle it?
Who needs him more than we do? Who?


1851
02:19:39.878 --> 02:19:44.339
I'm a cab driver. Not an investigator.
l gotta work.


1852
02:19:45.258 --> 02:19:47.759
l understand, of course, but...

1853
02:19:49.762 --> 02:19:51.346
...l don't know.

1854
02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:58.520
l don't know, I used to have contacts
in the prosecutor's office.


1855
02:19:58.563 --> 02:20:02.649
But thatwas 100 years ago,
when dad was alive.


1856
02:20:03.151 --> 02:20:06.153
And I'm supposed to go
to Japan for six months.


1857
02:20:06.279 --> 02:20:10.073
It's a complicated project.
It's notjust me, understand.


1858
02:20:10.200 --> 02:20:13.243
l have 850 employees to think about.

1859
02:20:13.411 --> 02:20:16.830
What do you think?
That I'm going to work there,


1860
02:20:16.956 --> 02:20:21.460
while there's an innocent man
in prison who can't do anything?


1861
02:20:26.174 --> 02:20:28.509
The 21st, 22nd...

1862
02:20:28.676 --> 02:20:30.969
...and the 20, yes.

1863
02:20:31.137 --> 02:20:35.432
l for example have four operations
scheduled nextweek.


1864
02:20:35.892 --> 02:20:40.020
On the 21st, the 23rd,
and two on the 24th.


1865
02:20:40.146 --> 02:20:44.024
Should I cancel them all?
How can l?


1866
02:20:44.234 --> 02:20:47.861
OK, gentlemen.

1867
02:20:48.071 --> 02:20:51.323
Let's say, purely hypothetically,

1868
02:20:51.449 --> 02:20:54.409
that, say I could do it, but how?

1869
02:20:54.577 --> 02:20:57.120
It's a very seriousjob. I'd need...

1870
02:20:57.288 --> 02:21:01.500
I'd need a ton oftime.
I'm producing a new reality show.


1871
02:21:01.626 --> 02:21:03.293
I'm working day and night.

1872
02:21:03.545 --> 02:21:06.255
The show's called "Planet Good."
It's...


1873
02:21:08.049 --> 02:21:11.051
OK, it's clearthatwe'd
all do it, butwhen?


1874
02:21:12.053 --> 02:21:16.014
A 3-month tour.
I'm already late, I'll have to catch up.


1875
02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:19.393
Listen, my dear, kind friends.

1876
02:21:19.519 --> 02:21:24.189
We've done a great thing.
We've liberated an innocent person.


1877
02:21:24.315 --> 02:21:26.984
One who's a strangerto us,
by the way.


1878
02:21:27.110 --> 02:21:29.069
We've fulfilled our duty asjurors.

1879
02:21:29.279 --> 02:21:32.197
The rest is up to other official organs.

1880
02:21:32.407 --> 02:21:35.158
Don't start an amateur investigation.

1881
02:21:35.326 --> 02:21:38.203
There are, after all, laws!

1882
02:21:38.371 --> 02:21:42.583
What is it? Have you all lost it?
Brave young pioneers.


1883
02:21:42.834 --> 02:21:47.212
You want to stick around till morning?
Come to your senses!


1884
02:21:47.338 --> 02:21:51.466
l have to be at the airport
in an hour and forty minutes.


1885
02:21:51.593 --> 02:21:55.095
My girlfriend's flying in from Dubai,
Julie.


1886
02:21:55.263 --> 02:21:59.016
She's 21 . It's been 2 months.
Are you trying to ruin my life?


1887
02:21:59.142 --> 02:22:01.226
Are you out of your minds?

1888
02:22:01.394 --> 02:22:04.688
l started to work out
like an old fool.


1889
02:22:04.897 --> 02:22:07.232
She has tits like melons.

1890
02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:11.612
l haven't seen herfor 2 months.
I'm in love, forthe first time.


1891
02:22:11.821 --> 02:22:13.822
Sixfeet one.

1892
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:16.074
Chocolate brown nipples. Like this.

1893
02:22:17.035 --> 02:22:19.661
Lips like Angelina Jolie. Green eyes...

1894
02:22:21.039 --> 02:22:25.626
Don't get me started on her ass,
I've gone on long enough.


1895
02:22:26.002 --> 02:22:29.796
They laugh at me at the cemetery.
l write poetry atwork.


1896
02:22:30.089 --> 02:22:33.342
"Julie, darling, dear.
Free me from myfear.


1897
02:22:33.468 --> 02:22:37.179
You're all that I desire.
Wind, and rain...


1898
02:22:37.305 --> 02:22:38.847
...and fire."

1899
02:22:40.058 --> 02:22:44.478
And I have to bang her every half hour.
Why do I work out?


1900
02:22:44.604 --> 02:22:45.896
21 years old.

1901
02:22:46.064 --> 02:22:50.734
l can't sleep. Listen,
I've had wet dreams 3 nights in a row.


1902
02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:53.528
Like I was 15.
When did you last have one?


1903
02:22:54.322 --> 02:22:56.657
Television... Understand?

1904
02:22:56.866 --> 02:22:59.910
I'm sick of this meeting.
Let's do something.


1905
02:23:00.078 --> 02:23:02.162
- Calm down.
- Don't touch me.


1906
02:23:02.330 --> 02:23:04.331
- Let's make a decision.
- Drink.


1907
02:23:04.499 --> 02:23:06.583
Drink it yourself.
Don't touch me!


1908
02:23:06.751 --> 02:23:08.669
Let's do something.

1909
02:23:11.881 --> 02:23:13.882
What's so funny, eh?

1910
02:23:17.178 --> 02:23:18.762
See that pipe?

1911
02:23:19.013 --> 02:23:21.348
- What's that...
- No, do you see it?


1912
02:23:21.599 --> 02:23:23.433
- How manyyears?
- 40.


1913
02:23:23.601 --> 02:23:25.602
- How many more to come?
- 40.


1914
02:23:25.853 --> 02:23:26.853
Another40.

1915
02:23:27.105 --> 02:23:28.730
And? What? What?

1916
02:23:29.440 --> 02:23:32.567
Everything's like that. Everything.

1917
02:23:32.985 --> 02:23:36.238
We come. We see. Wejudge.

1918
02:23:36.364 --> 02:23:39.908
We drink. We talk in circles.
That's all we do...


1919
02:23:40.034 --> 02:23:42.285
And everything's like that.

1920
02:24:01.597 --> 02:24:03.140
ln otherwords,

1921
02:24:03.307 --> 02:24:06.101
l have a suggestion.
Let's be honest adults.


1922
02:24:06.519 --> 02:24:10.731
lf even now,
after all my arguments,


1923
02:24:11.482 --> 02:24:14.484
you still vote to find
the kid not guilty


1924
02:24:14.610 --> 02:24:17.487
I'lljoin you. Sound good?

1925
02:24:18.698 --> 02:24:21.408
Wait a second. Wait. Wait.

1926
02:24:23.661 --> 02:24:28.707
And you'll definitely vote not guilty

1927
02:24:28.791 --> 02:24:30.584
ifwe all do?

1928
02:24:32.503 --> 02:24:34.337
l gave myword.

1929
02:24:34.505 --> 02:24:37.841
Well, you know, the word of an artist...

1930
02:24:39.385 --> 02:24:41.011
Fine.

1931
02:24:41.220 --> 02:24:45.515
Don't like the word of an artist,
l give you myword as an officer.


1932
02:24:47.643 --> 02:24:49.352
Ex-officer, right?

1933
02:24:54.692 --> 02:24:57.611
No such thing as a Russian ex-offi...

1934
02:25:22.929 --> 02:25:25.597
Let's vote. Who votes to find...

1935
02:25:27.183 --> 02:25:29.684
...the kid not guilty, raise your hand.

1936
02:25:34.982 --> 02:25:37.692
- We're voting for not guilty.
- Yes.


1937
02:25:43.866 --> 02:25:47.118
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,

1938
02:25:47.328 --> 02:25:49.871
...10, 1 1 ...

1939
02:25:56.003 --> 02:25:57.671
...12.

1940
02:26:18.943 --> 02:26:20.151
"Not Guilty".

1941
02:26:39.547 --> 02:26:41.298
It's still a better place.

1942
02:26:42.925 --> 02:26:45.552
No, it hasn'tworked outyet.
We'll talk.


1943
02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:52.517
Don't leave without me.

1944
02:27:09.869 --> 02:27:12.245
Would you recognize them?

1945
02:27:12.747 --> 02:27:15.165
Of course. I'll neverforget them.

1946
02:27:31.933 --> 02:27:33.600
We'll find them.

1947
02:27:33.851 --> 02:27:36.895
We'll find them. I promise.

1948
02:27:39.315 --> 02:27:40.649
Whatwas yOur father's name?

1949
02:27:40.816 --> 02:27:42.025
Ruslan.

1950
02:27:45.863 --> 02:27:48.615
- And your other one?
- Uncle Volodya.


1951
02:27:53.079 --> 02:27:54.371
My name's Nikolai.

1952
02:27:56.123 --> 02:27:58.458
Call me Uncle Nikolai.

1953
02:27:59.335 --> 02:28:01.044
lf you want.

1954
02:28:04.715 --> 02:28:09.552
Let's get out of here. Let's go.
You can live with me.


1955
02:30:22.686 --> 02:30:24.521
So it's like this.

1956
02:30:25.981 --> 02:30:28.858
lf you want to fly away, then fly.

1957
02:30:29.985 --> 02:30:33.947
The coast is clear.
lf you want to stay, then stay.


1958
02:30:34.156 --> 02:30:35.824
But make the decision

1959
02:30:36.867 --> 02:30:38.701
all by yourself.

1960
02:30:40.412 --> 02:30:42.747
Nobody will do it for you.

1961
02:30:46.752 --> 02:30:48.586
It's been an honor.

1962
02:32:01.410 --> 02:32:04.370
"THE LAW Is ALL POWERFUL
AND CONSTANT"


1963
02:32:04.538 --> 02:32:09.083
"BUT WHAT CAN BE DONE WHEN MERCY
HAS A GREATER FORCE THAN LAW"


1964
02:32:09.210 --> 02:32:11.127
