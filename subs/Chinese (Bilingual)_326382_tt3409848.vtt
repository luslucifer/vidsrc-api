我们需要那个男孩供认

11
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:44.570
他不开口
He's not talking.


12
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.860
要想摆脱自己的处境，首先必须得照顾好它

13
00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.690
我是为了你和这的其他人才说的这些

他什么也不肯说

27
00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.980
你宣过誓的

28
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.940
有一种鱼
There's a fish


29
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:47.480
花了一辈子的时间
that spends its life


30
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.480
游来游去
swimming to and fro.


31
00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.440
与水斗争，以免被扔到干燥的陆地上
Fighting water that seeks to cast it upon dry land.


32
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.940
因为水排斥它
Because the water rejects it.


33
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.150
水不想要它
The water doesn't want it.


34
00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:10.300
扎马

35
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.650
这些长期受苦的鱼
These long-suffering fish,


36
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.820
依附于排斥它们的元素
so attached to the element that repels them,


37
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.980
它们花费了所有的精力
devote all their energies


38
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.070
只为了留在原地
to remaining in place.


39
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.940
你永远不会在河中央找到它们
You'll never find them in the central part of the river,


40
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.570
但总能在岸边找到

我十分关切地给你写信

46
00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.780
不久后我就要离开了

47
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.690

48

我需要你和部长谈谈，迭戈

54
00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:18.150
我不想让那些寄生虫上我的船
I don't want those leeches embarking my ship.


55
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.650
你和财政部长的关系好吗？
Your relationship with the Treasury Minister is good?


56
00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:25.940
这里的每个人都愿意做交易，因达莱西奥

57
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.280
可已经超过一年没有付款了

58
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.900
我们得把奥连特尔人的白兰地卸下来
We have to unload the Oriental's brandy.


59
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.190
他在蒙得维的亚发了财

60
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:38.860
现在他想扩大自己的业务

61
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.780
马尔塔替我给你写信了吗？
Did Marta give you a letter for me?


62
00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.690
马尔塔做出了很多牺牲，迭戈

63
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.610
照顾你的孩子

64
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.360

请原谅，我现在想去休息一下
If you excuse me, I'll now retire to rest.


70
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.610
我们需要卫队吗？

- 他们叫我们小心“维库尼亚” - 维库尼亚已经死了！
- They warned us about a "Vicuña." - Vicuña is dead!

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.940
他被杀了有上千次了

别担心，你现在在可靠的人手里

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:03.980
没有意外或风险，扎马是不会隐藏他的义务

110
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.280

去她们的房间

维库尼亚已经被处决了

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.380
昨晚你的房间好像发生了一场混战？
Seems there was a scuffle in your room last night?


142
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.960
他们伤到你了吗？
Did they hurt you?


143
00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:00.760
你房东的女儿刚刚在市场上，她对维库尼亚·波尔图感到非常紧张
Your landlord's daughter was at the market. She was very nervous about Vicuña Porto.


144
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.510
看来迭戈先生得面对维库尼亚了！
It appears Don Diego faced Vicuña!


145
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.300
你奥连特尔的朋友，他可能得了霍乱
Your friend the Oriental, he might have cholera.


146
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.510
还有其他病例
There've been other cases.


147
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:20.010
- 要我派人去请帕洛斯医生吗？ - 不用了，我早知道会这样了
- Should I send for Doctor Palos? - No, I'm already aware.


148
00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:45.420
为了表彰卢西亚娜·皮纳尔·德·卢根加夫人的客人们
To honor the visit of Señora Luciana Piñares de Luenga,


149
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.090
我们亲爱的卢西亚娜
our beloved Luciana,


150
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:51.130
她会把彩带递给获胜者
she'll hand out the ribbons to the winner.


151
00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.260
我们到美术馆去吧，你可以坐在任何你感觉最自在的地方
Let's head to the gallery. You can sit wherever you feel most at ease.


152
00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:02.720
在我看来，我更喜欢一个忠实可靠
In my case, I prefer the company of a man who bears the white man's burden


153
00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:06.050
纯洁成圣的人
and is sanctified by purity.


154
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.630
卢西亚娜是财政部长的妻子，是吗？
Luciana is the Treasury Minister's wife, right?


155
00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:11.760
是的
Yes.


156
00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:16.170
有个笑话一直在流传
A joke has been making the rounds.


157
00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.010
他们说卢西亚娜拥有扎马所想象过的最美的身体
They say Luciana has the most beautiful body that Zama has ever imagined.


158
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.510
谁说的？
Who said that?


159
00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.760
大家都这么说
Over there.


160
00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.760
秃头人
The bald man.


161
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.920
也许我该走了
Maybe I should leave.


162
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:37.130
我没有那种气魄
I don't have the strength.


163
00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:52.130
帕洛斯医生？
Doctor Palos?


164
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.050
- 帕洛斯医生？ - 是那个死去的男孩
- Doctor Palos? - It's the dead boy.


165
00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.550
那个小圣徒在那儿
The little saint is there.


166
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:14.260
帕洛斯？
Palos?


167
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.300
你是谁？
Who are you?


168
00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:59.920
我想与财政部长荷奴里奥·皮纳尔·德·卢根加先生谈谈
I wish to speak with the Minister of the Treasury, Señor Honorio Piñares de Luenga.


169
00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.510
我的生意可以再说
My business can be postponed.


170
00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.760
我需要见一位有荣誉头衔的医生
I need to see a doctor who honors that title.


171
00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.510
我可以和房子里的其他人说句话吗？
May I speak with someone in the house?


172
00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.760
皮纳尔·德·卢根加夫人，她在里面吗？
And Señora Piñares de Luenga, is she in?


173
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:40.260
在两个蒸馏器中蒸馏
Distilled in a double alambic.


174
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.300
所以它在准备好之前被蒸馏了很多次
So it's distilled many times before it's ready.


175
00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.260
你会很喜欢的
You'll appreciate it.


176
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.880
这些菜谱被谨慎地保护着
These recipes are jealously guarded.


177
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.920
- 你去过布宜诺斯艾利斯吗？ - 去过
- Have you been to Buenos Aires? - Yes.


178
00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:01.130
我读到过许多喜剧剧团和他们的管弦乐队都在那一起演出
I read that many comedy troupes put on plays with their orchestras.


179
00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.920
我们这里几乎没有优雅的场所
We have almost no occasion for elegance here.


180
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.630
但你并不缺少优雅
That's not something you lack.


181
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.220
我的妻子想要去那
My wife wanted to go.


182
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.550
我的妻子想要去那
My wife wanted to go.


183
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.420
而我呢，总是在河上...
Me, I'm always on the river...


184
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.920
来来往往...
that comes and goes...


185
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:38.550
总是有各种原因到很远的地方去
Always far away, for one reason or another.


186
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.090
它在桶中有些年头了
It's aged in casks.


187
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.460
酒中贵族啊！
Such nobility!


188
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.510
看见那些了吗？
See those?


189
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:55.720
把小玻璃杯给我
Bring me the little glasses.


190
00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.380
不是，较小的那个
No, the smaller ones.


191
00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.300
真美
How beautiful.


192
00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.050
它们共有十二个，只有八个安全抵达
There were twelve of them. Only eight arrived.


193
00:26:04.170 --> 00:26:07.800
它们被放进了保护得很好的盒子里，但不是所有的盒子都有很好的被包装
They came in a box, well protected, but not all of them wrapped.


194
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.920
这样的包装真是懒惰
Such laziness, this packaging.


195
00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:14.220
它们被来自布宜诺斯艾利斯的报纸包裹着
They were wrapped in newspapers from Buenos Aires.


196
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.130
奇怪的是，和那个小队一起送来的
And curiously enough, sent with that flotilla,


197
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:23.220
报纸的日期比我包裹我玻璃杯的报纸日期还要早
were newspapers dated back further than the newspapers wrapped around my glasses.


198
00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:30.050
包裹我玻璃杯上的报纸新闻比这里报纸刊登的新闻还要多
My glasses carried more recent news than the papers distributed here.


199
00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:31.800
是不是很吸引人？
Isn't that charming?


200
00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:33.920
还是很感伤？
And sad?


201
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:40.960
这对你不重要，迭戈先生，因为我听说你随时都有可能被调走
It doesn't weigh on you, don Diego, because you'll be transferred any day now, I hear.


202
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.260
这对你不重要，迭戈先生，因为我听说你随时都有可能被调走
It doesn't weigh on you, don Diego, because you'll be transferred any day now, I hear.


203
00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.050
你希望被派遣到哪里？
Where are you hoping to be sent?


204
00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.050
莱尔马
To the city of Lerma.


205
00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:58.720
但不会是现在
But not just yet.


206
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.510
我们这里几乎没有优雅的场所
We have almost no occasion for elegance here.


207
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:08.220
报纸谈到了一部剧引起的轰动...
The newspapers spoke of the uproar caused by...


208
00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.510
我忘记名字了
I forget the play.


209
00:27:10.630 --> 00:27:12.260
掌声雷动...
The applause...


210
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:15.420
多么难得的场合，各种喝彩和掌声
How rare, the occasions for applause.


211
00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:36.010
敬那些敢于伪装自己的演员们！
To the actors who dare to disguise themselves!


212
00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.920
我们的朋友似乎感觉不太好
Our friend is not well.


213
00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:27.050
- 要我派人去请帕洛斯医生吗？ - 不用了，我早知道会这样了
- Should I send for Doctor Palos? - No, I'm already aware.


214
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.220
迭戈...
Diego...


215
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:34.130
这对我来说是多么及时，去为你朋友的事情求情
How timely it is for me to intercede in favor of your friend's affairs.


216
00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.090
卢西亚娜
Luciana.


217
00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:40.050
请进！
Come in!


218
00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.920
他走了吗？
Has he left?


219
00:28:44.050 --> 00:28:45.630
他感到不舒服
He felt indisposed.


220
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:48.220
那么原谅他的粗鲁无礼了
His poor manners are forgiven.


221
00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:52.380
- 你应该叫帕洛斯医生来看看 - 我会的
- You should send for Doctor Palos. - Of course.


222
00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.960
等你朋友一康复，一定要再来我这，迭戈
As soon as your friend recovers, come see me again, Diego.


223
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.840
我会尽我所能
I'll do everything in my powers.


224
00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:02.300
我会给我丈夫寄一封信
I'll send a letter to my husband,


225
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.670
告诉他我们的事情
informing him of our affairs.


226
00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.510
当他离开时，他用温柔的信件折磨着我
When he's away, he torments me with tender missives.


227
00:29:12.010 --> 00:29:14.300
那个黑仆
This servant here, this black,


228
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.420
送来往信件的，而且还是在这种大热天下...
comes and goes with messages. With this heat...


229
00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.340
夫人
Señora,


230
00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.340
得知这件事让我很难过
it grieves me to learn this.


231
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:33.720
许多女人轻视我的独守空房
Many women despise my independence.


232
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.090
而又有许多男人歪曲我的举止
And too many men misunderstand my conduct.


233
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:39.300
眼光狭小的人们
Small-minded people.


234
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:42.630
然而丰盈
Yet abundant.


235
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:53.090
在这样的大城市里
People are less alone


236
00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:57.720
人们并不都是孤独的，而又相知甚少，你不觉得吗？
in the big cities, while knowing each other less, don't you think?


237
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.800
是这个夏天太糟糕了，或只是我不耐烦了？
Is this summer worse, or am I just more impatient?


238
00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.800
房子使我窒息
Houses suffocate me.


239
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:09.720
我更喜欢河流
I prefer the river.


240
00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:19.840
要是我们有几个寒冷的月份就好了
If only we had some cold months.


241
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.300
是的，没有冬天的话，感觉时间就没有过去
Yes, time doesn't pass when there's no winter.


242
00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:27.010
雪...
The snow...


243
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.010
如此优雅
So elegant.


244
00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:34.170
俄国公主裹着裘皮
The Russian princesses wrapped in furs.


245
00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:38.510
喷着香水
The perfumes.


246
00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.090
还有那铺着地毯而又暖和的房子
The heated houses, with rugs.


247
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.960
欧洲永远总是被那些从未拥有过的人铭记
Europe is best remembered by those who were never there.


248
00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.670
而我对这些一无所知
I recall nothing about it.


249
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:52.550
婚姻迫使你忘记
Marriage forces you to forget.


250
00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:54.300
又或者我曾被告知过
Or so I've been told.


251
00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.170
迭戈，我们不要鲁莽行事
Diego, let's not be reckless.


252
00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.840
- 总督派我来帮助你 - 这场闹剧是怎么回事？
- The Governor has sent me to assist you. - What's this circus?


253
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.380
这些人上面有人
These people have friends in high places.


254
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.630
- 总督想保住他的位子 - 那我的位子呢？
- The Governor wants to hold onto his position. - My position?


255
00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.220
好吧，你也一样
Yes. Yours, too.


256
00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.760
治安法官，迭戈·德·扎马
The Administration's Magistrate, Diego de Zama.


257
00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.510
文图拉·普列托，治安法官助理
Ventura Prieto, Assistant Magistrate.


258
00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:21.630
我们是康涅狄格州的老移民
We are old settlers of Concepción.


259
00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.460
第一批来者的后代
Descendants of the first-comers.


260
00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.340
我们的父亲是伊腊拉多明戈市的
Our father is a direct, blood descendant


261
00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.300
一个直系血统的继承人
of don Domingo Martínez de Irala.


262
00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:36.800
我们从这些土地上追赶印第安人
We chased the Indians from these lands.


263
00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:42.760
但他们带着主张回来了
But they came back with claims.


264
00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.550
我们又一次追赶他们
We chased them out again,


265
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.010
诸如此类
and so on.


266
00:32:50.130 --> 00:32:52.340
他们逃到丛林里去了
They fled into the jungle.


267
00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:55.720
我们去找他们
We went looking for them,


268
00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.720
决不留情
and showed no mercy.


269
00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:05.510
无人幸免，而现在没有人留下来工作
None were spared. And now there's no one left to work.


270
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.760
我只有我的孙女
I only have my granddaughter.


271
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.760
她浑身是血
She has mixed blood.


272
00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.840
她被俘虏了
She was held captive.


273
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.340
我们设法把她弄回来了
We managed to get her back.


274
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:28.760
我们有权利要求赔偿
It's our right to claim an encomienda.


275
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.170
四十个被驯服的印第安人
Forty tame Indians.


276
00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.050
印第安人有让步吗？
A concession of Indians?


277
00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:48.010
你会有足够的印第安人的
You shall have enough Indians.


278
00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.090
你不会受到任何伤害
You may return in peace.


279
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:55.840
你有总督的话：陛下会接受你的请求
You have the Governor's word: His Majesty will receive your request.


280
00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.880
他们没有头衔或文件，我们什么都没有
They don't have title deeds or documents. We have nothing.


281
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:35.340
找个方法来取回它们，这个贵族家庭已经受够了
Find a way to retrieve them. This noble family has suffered enough.


282
00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.670
伊腊拉家族不足以奴役当地人
The name of Irala isn't enough to enslave natives.


283
00:34:41.670 --> 00:34:43.420
你说什么？文图拉
What did you say, Ventura?


284
00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:48.510
拿走自由需要的不仅仅是一张有写有伊腊拉名字的纸
Taking away freedom requires more than a paper with Irala's name on it.


285
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.380
你是不同意我的善举吗？
You disapprove of my benevolence?


286
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:55.130
你认为什么样的称谓才能拥有获得印第安人的恩赐？
What title do you deem valid to obtain an encomienda of Indians?


287
00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:57.960
一个也没有
None.


288
00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.920
我是在和王室的工职人员谈说话吗？
Am I talking to a functionary of the Crown?


289
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:04.960
你是在和一个
You're talking to a man


290
00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:08.220
惊讶于想要被误认为是西班牙人的美国人的数量
astonished by the number of Americans who want to pass for Spaniards


291
00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.550
而不是他们本该是什么的人说话
instead of being what they are.


292
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.550
“一个惊讶于...”
"A man, astonished by..."


293
00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:27.510
真是勇敢！
Such bravura!


294
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.920
他们说你差点俘获了维库尼亚·波尔图！
They say you almost captured Vicuña Porto!


295
00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.780
迭戈
Diego,


296
00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:24.440
他们对你做了什么？
what have they done to you?


297
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.730
你什么时候回来？
When will you return?


298
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.320
你们孩子们正在长大
Your children are growing.


299
00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:31.570
他们厌倦了
They're growing tired.


300
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.020
我也一样
And so am I.


301
00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.320
我会很快回去的，马尔塔
I'll be there soon, Marta.


302
00:36:41.860 --> 00:36:43.980
有艘船来了
A ship is coming.


303
00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:47.780
带着王室信件
With Royal Mail.


304
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:51.020
至于逾期的付款
For overdue payments.


305
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.400
我们必须要有耐心，马尔塔
We must be patient, Marta.


306
00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.230
你受伤了吗？
Are you hurt?


307
00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:21.070
他侮辱了我
He humiliated me.


308
00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:24.190
他咬我
He bit me.


309
00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:30.190
咬了很多次
So many times.


310
00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.110
你替我报仇了吗？迭戈
Have you avenged me, Diego?


311
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:43.650
他强迫我顺从他的欲望，他嘲弄我
He forced me to submit to his desires. He mocked me.


312
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.610
你要为我报仇
You avenged me.


313
00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.520
谁做的这些？丽塔
Who did this, Rita?


314
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.860
贝尔德兹长官
Officer Bermúdez.


315
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:58.150
秃顶那个？
The bald one?


316
00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:02.020
他认为没有人愿意为我辩护
He thought no one would come to my defense.


317
00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:06.360
你，扎马，一无所有
You, Zama, who have nothing.


318
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.780
我是不会让我父亲去参与一场斗争
I won't let my father fight a duel.


319
00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.650
你没有什么可失去的
You have nothing to lose.


320
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:18.360
你要为我报仇
You avenged me.


321
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.820
而现在...
And now...


322
00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.980
那个坏蛋死了
that scoundrel is dead.


323
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:25.940
不
No.


324
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:29.480
我没有杀他
I didn't kill him.


325
00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:32.520
谁说的？
Who said that?


326
00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.690
那你必须为我报仇
Then you must avenge me.


327
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:39.320
你有杀戮的能力，你没有什么可失去的
You're capable of killing, you have nothing to lose.


328
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.480
不，我有
Yes, I do.


329
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.020
我有妻子
A wife.


330
00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:46.860
我还有孩子，丽塔
I have children, Rita.


331
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:52.320
我是王室的治安法官，是个公务员
I'm the Crown's magistrate. A functionary.


332
00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.780
一个修道士来了
A monk has come.


333
00:38:57.730 --> 00:39:01.150
他说你应该为丧葬费买单
He said you should pay for the funeral expenses.


334
00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:08.070
谁死了？丽塔
Who died, Rita?


335
00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:33.860
必须提前支付一部分
A part of the payment must be advanced.


336
00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:37.320
当然，其余的可以在哀悼期允许的情况下支付
The rest can be paid when the mourning period allows, of course.


337
00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.520
有人告诉我，死者的货物在海关被扣留了
I was told the cargo of the deceased is being held up at customs.


338
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.520
他们扣押了吗？
Have they seized it?


339
00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:51.940
他们拿走了两个桶来支付丧葬费用
They released two casks to cover burial expenses.


340
00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.730
我们出售白兰地的价格是非常合理的
Brandy that we sell at a very reasonable price.


341
00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.520
人们已经厌倦了杜松子酒...
People grow tired of schnapps...


342
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.360
其他的桶被扣押了
The other casks were taken into custody.


343
00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.230
海关官员告知我的
The customs officer informed me.


344
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:14.520
死神对于我们所有人来说都是有强加条件的
Death imposes conditions on all of us.


345
00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:18.780
如果我为穷人举行葬礼，我会冒犯了他的声望
I'll offend his stature if I conduct a ceremony for the poor.


346
00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.230
放哪？
Where?


347
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.190
他父亲旁边
Next to his father.


348
00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:31.440
这些尸体的制备费用必须在转移到蒙得维的亚之前支付
The preparation of the bodies must be paid for before their transfer to Montevideo.


349
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:37.360
在那之前，我们必须把它们放在我们的地窖里
Until then, we'll have to keep them in our crypt.


350
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.230
这里温度比较低
It's cooler here.


351
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.820
我们也可以烧掉它们
We could also burn them.


352
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.480
他们死于瘟疫
They died of the plague.


353
00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.730
阁下，不要招致更多的开支
Don't incur further expenses, Excellency.


354
00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:57.940
这需要和负责帐目的主管会计师讨论下
That needs to be discussed with the Father Accountant in charge of accounts.


355
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.690
我想要刮胡子
I would like to shave.


356
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:34.070
我不想让你听到别人不幸的事
I didn't want you to hear about the unfortunate event from anyone else.


357
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.440
我们的朋友，奥连特尔人，已经死了
Our friend, the Oriental, is dead.


358
00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.360
别扇了
I don't need air.


359
00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.940
你的朋友身体也不是很好
Your friend wasn't well.


360
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:03.400
一个死去的男孩？
A dead boy?


361
00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.980
船只上的瘟疫是无情的
The plague in the ships is relentless.


362
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.980
真是不幸啊！
How unfortunate.


363
00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:14.570
玛伦巴想要结婚
Malemba wants to get married.


364
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:16.520
谁是玛伦巴？
Who is Malemba?


365
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:21.860
葬礼会使我们这些日子都很忙，我们必须为哀悼做准备
The funeral will keep us very busy these days. We must prepare for the mourning.


366
00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.190
让我们为他的荣誉干杯吧
Let's drink in his honor.


367
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.230
不会有人守灵的
There won't be a wake.


368
00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:29.520
奥连特尔人是个严肃的人
The Oriental was an austere man.


369
00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.940
主教认为我们应该按他的方式来
The Bishop believes we should adhere to his ways.


370
00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.480
真是朴素
Such austerity.


371
00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:40.070
可惜了
What a pity.


372
00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.150
不会有人守灵的，只有一些谦虚和无聊的东西
There will be no wake. Only something modest and boring.


373
00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.190
多么悲哀，真遗憾啊
How sad. What a shame.


374
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.940
谁想要结婚？
Who wants to get married?


375
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:52.940
玛伦巴
Malemba.


376
00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:56.650
她赎回了她的自由，但又想要失去它
She bought her freedom and already wants to lose it.


377
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.610
我告诉我丈夫：她不能准许
I told my husband: she can't give her consent.


378
00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:01.860
一个哑巴能给与出她的准许吗？
Can a mute give her consent?


379
00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.230
不能！
No!


380
00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.190
黑仆今天送来了信件
The black came today with letters.


381
00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.440
人人都在觊觎我的身体
All men covet my body.


382
00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.690
荷奴里奥，我的丈夫，被肉欲迷住了
Honorio, my own husband, is fascinated by flesh.


383
00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.690
我鄙视他
I despise him.


384
00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.780
和那些渴望拥有一切的人
And all men for their desire to possess.


385
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.520
我很感激
I'm grateful


386
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.520
因为遇见了一个你这样有个性的女人
for having met a woman of your character.


387
00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:35.940
玛伦巴受的苦够多了
Malemba has suffered enough.


388
00:43:36.690 --> 00:43:40.400
她游过了河，逃离了一个虐待狂的烟农
She swam across the river, fleeing an abusive tobacco farmer.


389
00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:43.110
她游了好几个小时，多长时间来着？
She swam not only for hours. How long was it?


390
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.730
游了多久？
How long?


391
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:50.690
一整天都待在水中，紧紧的握住她的生命，然而她还是在查科被抓了
Days in the water, holding on to her life. She was captured again in Chaco.


392
00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.610
他们剥了她的脚皮
They skinned her feet,


393
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.440
把那可怕的植物揉搓在她身上
and rubbed that horrible plant on her.


394
00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.690
还有她的脚底上
On the soles of her feet.


395
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:12.400
我以为她的哑巴和跛行是联系在一起的
I thought her muteness and limping were linked.


396
00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:14.570
但她不是哑巴
She's not mute.


397
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:16.360
她有舌头
She has her tongue.


398
00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:27.110
我想解决这桩婚事
I want to settle this marriage affair.


399
00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.230
玛伦巴的婚事
Malemba's.


400
00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:35.520
没有什么能阻止它
Nothing prevents it.


401
00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:38.820
有效同意书需以书面形式给出
Valid consent is given in written form.


402
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.650
你丈夫的签字并会使婚姻具有合法性
Your husband's signature will validate the union.


403
00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:43.900
你的哑巴可以结婚
Your mute can get married.


404
00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.940
你应得一个吻
You deserve a kiss.


405
00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.070
但不是现在
Not now.


406
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.440
给迭戈·德·扎马的消息
A message for Diego de Zama.


407
00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:25.650
我就是，请说
It's me. Speak.


408
00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.110
总督说你得走了
The Governor says you must go.


409
00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:29.940
我得走了？
I must go?


410
00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:32.110
去他的办公室
To his office.


411
00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.730
消息已传达
Mail has arrived.


412
00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:59.730
搞定了！
It's over!！


413
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:16.780
总督？
Governor?


414
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:30.190
“请求在听证会上遵守这项主权条款
"Having requested observance of this sovereign provision


415
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.900
并在本案中听取王室协议
and given a hearing to the Royal Accord on this case,


416
00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.110
我已经通过去年11月27日的这项法令解决了此案
I have resolved by this decree of last November 27th,


417
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:39.280
正如我宣布的声明，吧啦吧啦吧啦...”
declaring as I declare, that blah, blah, blah..."


418
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:42.230
我要被调到西班牙去了
I'm being transferred to Spain.


419
00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.440
王室信件？
Royal Mail?


420
00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.360
什么时候到的？有给我的消息吗？
When did it arrive? Any news for me?


421
00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.400
没有，暂时没有
No, not yet.


422
00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:59.940
由于你的较高官衔，我被迫驱逐了文图拉·普列托
I've been forced, due to your superior rank, to deport Ventura Prieto.


423
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:07.020
因为争吵而驱逐？
Deported for a brawl?


424
00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:09.190
那只是一场争吵
It was just a brawl.


425
00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:15.070
街头争吵对你的地位很不利
A street brawl doesn't look good for a functionary of your status.


426
00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:19.520
我不想过分的苛刻
I didn't want to be excessively severe.


427
00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.360
我给文图拉·普列托写了一封推荐信
I've written a recommendation letter for Ventura Prieto.


428
00:47:24.110 --> 00:47:27.400
重要的是他的名誉不会受到玷污
What's important is that his reputation not be tainted.


429
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.190
文图拉是西班牙的公务员
Ventura is a Spanish functionary.


430
00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.230
你负担不起这样的风险，迭戈
You can't afford such risks, Diego.


431
00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:39.980
你已经选择了莱尔马
You've chosen the city of Lerma.


432
00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:41.320
是的
Yes.


433
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.320
我已要求调到莱尔马
I've requested a transfer to the city of Lerma.


434
00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.400
文图拉·普列托也选择了莱尔马
Ventura Prieto has chosen the city of Lerma.


435
00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.070
被驱逐出境的...
The deported...


436
00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.520
可以选择他的目的地
gets to choose his destination


437
00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.900
并得到推荐？
and gets a recommendation?


438
00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:06.230
把王室的决议抄录一份
Make a copy of the Crown's resolution.


439
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.520
并立即宣布我即将起程
And announce my departure at once.


440
00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.440
玛伦巴
Malemba,


441
00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.070
告诉夫人我需要见她
tell your Señora I need to see her.


442
00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:30.980
玛伦巴，有人在门口吗？
Malemba, is someone at the door?


443
00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:42.650
你不打算通知一声吗？
Will you not announce me?


444
00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:14.820
荷奴里奥已经睡了一阵子，突然我惊醒了，看见了它
Honorio had been asleep for a while when suddenly I woke up startled and saw it,


445
00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:17.190
它爬上了荷奴里奥的脖子
crawling up Honorio's neck.


446
00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:20.520
我无法动弹、哭泣或呼喊
I couldn't move, cry or shout.


447
00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:24.280
这是什么？
What's here?


448
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.650
很痒
It itches.


449
00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:34.730
黎明时分，我在地上看到了它，它还在移动，背上有蛆
At dawn, I saw it on the ground. It was still moving, with grubs on its back.


450
00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.070
它是蛛蜂
It was the spider wasp.


451
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:39.690
它在活蜘蛛体内产卵
It lays eggs inside living spiders.


452
00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:51.820
帮我一下
Help me with this.


453
00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:00.110
玛伦巴，有人在门口吗？
Malemba, is someone at the door?


454
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.190
大马士革的窗帘

455
00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.780
丢失
Missing.


456
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.360
有乌木钉的桌子
A table with ebony nailing.


457
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.400
那墙上本有一幅画
There was a painting on that wall.


458
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.730
国王陛下的肖像
A portrait of Our Majesty, the King.


459
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:52.400
总督也非常喜欢那幅画
The Governor was very fond of that painting, too.


460
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.570
天鹅绒沙发的椅子呢？
The chairs with velvet upholstery?


461
00:51:58.440 --> 00:52:00.440
他也是很喜欢
They were to his liking, too.


462
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:05.070
他拿着马具和14个马鞍
He took the harnesses and 14 saddles.


463
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.190
我应该记录下这些吗？
Should I record this?


464
00:52:49.150 --> 00:52:50.780
不是他
That's not him.


465
00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:54.480
是那个
It's that one.


466
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.900
他不能走吗？
Can't he walk?


467
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.480
他能说话吗？
Does he talk?


468
00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:14.020
会几个词
A few words.


469
00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:38.440
“当有很多鱼的时候，水手的妻子会变得富有！”
"The sailor's wife gets rich, when plenty are the fish!"


470
00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.150
来，扎马，拉把椅子过来
Come, Zama. Pull up a chair.


471
00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.230
今天是个幸运日
Today is a lucky day.


472
00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:55.230
给他看看耳朵
Show him the ears.


473
00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:02.980
告诉他那个故事
Tell him the story.


474
00:54:03.610 --> 00:54:06.110
这耳朵是维库尼亚·波尔图的
The ears of Vicuña Porto,


475
00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:09.150
在处决前被切了下来
cut off before his execution.


476
00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:12.570
残忍的人啊...
The cruelty of men...


477
00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.780
这就是个岌岌可危的问题
This is what's at stake.


478
00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:17.940
轻点
Slowly.


479
00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:26.230
总督，我给你带来了一个抄写员
Governor, I've brought you a scribe.


480
00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.280
如果这场游戏能持续很长时间的话，我会让他走的
If this game will last for long, I can excuse him.


481
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:34.820
抄写员？
A scribe?


482
00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:37.860
为你所提出的事写信
For the letter you offered to write.


483
00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:42.520
写什么信？
What letter?


484
00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:46.980
在我成为父亲的时，我向国王提出过的请求
My request to the King on the occasion of my becoming a father.


485
00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.440
你是个父亲？
You're a father?


486
00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:52.190
把孩子带来，他们能带来好运
Bring the child, they bring luck.


487
00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:00.070
耳朵易手！
The ears change hands!


488
00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.520
包里有什么？
What's in the bag?


489
00:55:10.650 --> 00:55:12.110
让我来
Allow me.


490
00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.020
好极了，好极了！
Well, well!


491
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:29.480
治安法官
Magistrate.


492
00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.020
这个...毫无价值
This... is worthless.


493
00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:41.860
椰子毫无价值，对吧？
Coconuts are worthless, right?


494
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:43.980
没关系
Doesn't matter.


495
00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:45.780
不管怎样，我还是会留着它
I'll keep it anyway.


496
00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:47.980
警员
Officer,


497
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:50.940
把我们的朋友送到城门去
see our friend to the city gates.


498
00:55:51.070 --> 00:55:52.900
维库尼亚·波尔图已经死了
Vicuña Porto is dead.


499
00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.230
没有人可以碰它们
One shouldn't touch them.


500
00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.190
别碰
Don't touch.


501
00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.610
不
No.


502
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:03.480
这耳朵是维库尼亚·波尔图的
The ears of Vicuña Porto.


503
00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.020
维库尼亚...
Vicuña...


504
00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:09.150
...已经死了
...is dead.


505
00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:12.480
这耳朵是维库尼亚·波尔图的
The ears of Vicuña Porto.


506
00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:13.940
总督
Governor,


507
00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.860
你能处理一下那封信吗？
could you attend to the letter?


508
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.320
当然可以
Of course.


509
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:22.150
给国王的一封要求你调动的信
A letter to the King requesting your transfer.


510
00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.230
我们会为我的好朋友向陛下恳求的
We'll plead to His Majesty for my good friend.


511
00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:53.570
你在写什么？
What are you writing?


512
00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.360
一本书，总督
A book, Governor.


513
00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:03.020
我们需要起草一封信，然后...
We need to draft a letter to be sealed and...


514
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:04.940
一本书？
A book?


515
00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:07.520
一本书？
A book?


516
00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:10.190
要造孩子
Make children,


517
00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.980
而不是写书
not books.


518
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:16.940
从我们的治安法官曼努埃尔那里吸取教训
Learn a lesson from our Magistrate, Manuel.


519
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:24.520
我不知道我的孩子会怎样
I can't know how my children will be.


520
00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.610
但我知道这本书该怎么写
But I do know how this book will be.


521
00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:39.320
阁下，我相信没什么好担心的
Your Eminence, I believe there's nothing to worry about.


522
00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:50.190
走起来
Let's go.


523
00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.190
- 我应该再找一个抄写员吗？ - 走起来！
- Should I look for another scribe? - Let's go!


524
00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.400
我应该再找一个抄写员吗？
Should I look for another scribe?


525
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.860
为什么要在政府办公区里写一本书
Why write a book inside the house of Government,


526
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:17.190
而其他人都在为陛下的荣耀而工作？
while others work for the glory of His Majesty?


527
00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:19.360
我只是希望...
I only wish...


528
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:24.440
你知道这本书吗？
Were you aware of this book?


529
00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:28.320
阁下，我相信没什么好担心的
Your Eminence, I believe there's nothing to worry about.


530
00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:30.480
你不知道这本书吗？
You didn't know about this book?


531
00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:33.360
我从没听说过这本书
I never knew about the book.


532
00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:37.020
扎马，你来这儿多久了？你对此一无所知吗？
How long have you been here, Zama? You knew nothing about it?


533
00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:44.360
政府中最老的官员也对这本书一无所知？
The oldest functionary in the Administration knows nothing about this book?


534
00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:52.690
我想用他们的头烤这些鱼
I want to grill those fish with their heads.


535
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:03.940
把马赶出去，这不是马厩
Get the horses out of here. This isn't a stable.


536
00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:17.730
- 怎么了？ - 给迭戈·德·扎马的消息
- What is it? - A message for Diego de Zama.


537
00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:22.020
- 我就是，怎么了？ - 财产清单
- That's me. What is it? - Inventory.


538
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:26.820
什么财产清单？
What inventory?


539
00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:29.480
他们把所有的东西都搬到院子里去了
They're taking everything to the patio.


540
00:59:33.730 --> 00:59:37.440
总督命令每个人都要清洁整理
The Governor commands everyone to clean and tidy up.


541
00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:53.280
拿着这个
Take this.


542
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:38.110
我知道总督要你来就我的书作报告
I know the Governor has requested you report on my book.


543
01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:40.070
这就是
Here it is.


544
01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.520
供您考虑
For your consideration.


545
01:00:43.690 --> 01:00:45.110
费尔南德斯
Fernández,


546
01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:48.280
我还没有决定我的新住所
I haven't yet decided on my new residence.


547
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:51.940
我的家具还需放在教堂里一段时间
I need to keep my furniture in the chapel a bit longer.


548
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:53.520
让我帮你
Let me help you.


549
01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:55.730
你是我的第一个读者
You're my first reader.


550
01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.610
哪些是你的东西？
Which are your things?


551
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:01.570
那张床
The bed.


552
01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:04.360
这三把椅子
These three chairs.


553
01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:09.320
两个写着我名字的小箱子
Two small chests with my name on them.


554
01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.690
他们正在清点政府的财产
They're making an inventory of the Government's property.


555
01:01:34.980 --> 01:01:37.280
你的家具已经被登记了
Your furniture has been listed.


556
01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:40.520
我可以去掉些东西
I could remove some things.


557
01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.320
但它是有代价的
But it has a cost.


558
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:46.480
真是办事不力！
How inadequate!


559
01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:49.150
当我在新的住所定居后
When I've settled in a new residence,


560
01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:51.190
我会派人来拿我的东西的
I'll send for my belongings.


561
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:56.520
我们现在必须尽最大的努力去做这件事
We must do it now, and with the utmost discretion.


562
01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.860
有人告诉我郊区有家旅店可以住
I was told of an inn on the outskirts.


563
01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:04.860
让我帮你
Let me help you.


564
01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.110
你是我的第一个读者
You're my first reader.


565
01:02:09.070 --> 01:02:10.860
搬的时候小心点
Take care of the move.


566
01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.780
她抱着的那个男孩是我儿子
That boy she's holding is my son.


567
01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.360
- 那是他的母亲吗？ - 是的
- Is that the mother? - Yes.


568
01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.860
就那个
That one.


569
01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:01.730
艾米莉亚
Emilia.


570
01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.110
费尔南德斯
Fernández,


571
01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:09.440
把那张床搬给艾米莉亚夫人
take that bed to Señora Emilia.


572
01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.820
这个垃圾场是怎么回事？
What is this dump?


573
01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.650
搬运工
The porters,


574
01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.480
他们害怕这所房子
they're afraid of this house.


575
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:53.610
把它放在那
Leave it there.


576
01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:07.070
我只呆几天
I'll only stay a few days.


577
01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.940
直到我找到合适的住所
Until I find a proper residence.


578
01:05:18.070 --> 01:05:20.610
把这本书保存起来，直到你完成报告为止
Keep the book until you finish it.


579
01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.440
我还没有制作一个副本
I haven't made a copy.


580
01:05:22.570 --> 01:05:25.440
我对你的书一无所知
I know nothing about your book.


581
01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:29.690
我从来不知道它存在，而且没有人要求我报告
I never knew it existed. And no one has requested a report.


582
01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:35.150
总督认为政府的办公时间应是在为国王服务
The Governor feels that working hours at the Government House are to serve the King.


583
01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:37.610
大人
Your Grace,


584
01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.480
恕我直言
with all due respect,


585
01:05:40.690 --> 01:05:43.190
当我写书的时候，我没有老师
I have no master, when I write my book.


586
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:02.690
我希望它是无法解释的现象
I wish it were the inexplicable.


587
01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.110
但是，有一个男孩在里面
But a boy is in there.


588
01:06:08.070 --> 01:06:09.860
埋了这本书
Bury this book,


589
01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:12.690
直到这一切结束，费尔南德斯
until all of this blows over, Fernández.


590
01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:28.610
走开！
Go away!


591
01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:44.980
你是谁？
Who are you?


592
01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:49.360
祖马拉
Zumala.


593
01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:53.400
给我一条链子和一把锁
Bring me a chain and a lock.


594
01:06:55.110 --> 01:06:57.520
没有人可以进入这所房子
No one enters this house.


595
01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.820
告诉旅店老板给我拿一条链子和一把锁来
Tell the innkeeper to bring me a chain and a lock.


596
01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.190
他病了
He's sick.


597
01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.400
旅店老板生病了
The innkeeper is sick.


598
01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:29.070
我需要一件衬衣
I need a shirt.


599
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:30.820
我是你的妻子吗？
Am I your wife?


600
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.610
你是我儿子的母亲
You're the mother of my son.


601
01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:23.480
总督，我应该为你给国王写的提议
Governor, should I fetch another scribe


602
01:08:23.610 --> 01:08:27.400
再找个抄写员吗？
for the letter to the King that you suggested?


603
01:08:30.150 --> 01:08:32.780
没有报告就没有信
No letter without a report.


604
01:08:33.690 --> 01:08:35.190
什么报告？
What report?


605
01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.650
需要我自己去要吗？
Do I need to ask for it?


606
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.070
一本背着王室写的书，也就是背着你写的书
A book is being written behind the Crown's back, which is your back as well.


607
01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:46.320
阁下，我想您不必担心
Your Eminence, I don't think you should worry.


608
01:08:48.230 --> 01:08:50.110
你应该担心
You should worry.


609
01:08:50.230 --> 01:08:53.070
我需要一份残酷的报告
I expect a damning report, ruthless,


610
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:57.820
无情地结束这场骗局
that puts an end to this chicanery.


611
01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:02.860
只有这样，我才愿意向国王提出你的要求
Only then will I be willing to make your request to the King.


612
01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:06.980
当然，你的儿子是个私生子
Leaving out, of course, that your son is a bastard.


613
01:09:09.730 --> 01:09:11.520
身为治安法官应该很清楚
The Magistrate knows well


614
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:17.110
这种好处只会留给公务员的合法儿子
that this benefit is only reserved for a functionary's legitimate son.


615
01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:24.690
总督
Governor,


616
01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:29.780
我的调动已经在可容忍的时间内延误很久了
my transfer has suffered more delays than those tolerable.


617
01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:32.860
这是我的想法：
Here's what I think:


618
01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.150
你想要离开？
You want to leave?


619
01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.230
那就写报告
Write the report.


620
01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:52.570
他有他自己的方式
He has his ways.


621
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:56.400
他们说他无缘无故地处死了维库尼亚
They say he executed Vicuña without mercy.


622
01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.940
祖马拉！
Zumala!


623
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:26.320
祖马拉...
Zumala...


624
01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:30.070
我敲了铃，但没有人回答
I rang the bell and nobody answered.


625
01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:32.480
我想吃点东西
I'd like to eat.


626
01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.730
我们都很难过
We were sad.


627
01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:35.940
她死了
She died.


628
01:11:36.070 --> 01:11:37.440
谁死了？
Who died?


629
01:11:37.570 --> 01:11:39.650
祖马拉已经死了
Zumala is dead.


630
01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:42.570
那你是谁？
Then who are you?


631
01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:45.690
托拉
Tora.


632
01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:48.020
托拉
Tora,


633
01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.320
你应该把我介绍给其他客人...
you should introduce me to the other guests...


634
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:56.400
- 那位留着头发的女士... - 你是唯一一位客人，扎马
- the ladies with the hair... - You are our only guest, Zama.


635
01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.730
治安法官...
Magistrate...


636
01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:10.780
总督下令重新整理
The Governor ordered this rearrangement.


637
01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:57.690
听候吩咐
At your service.


638
01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:22.440
这些天很少
These are days of scarce work


639
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.360
为我的职位效劳了
for my Ministry.


640
01:14:27.860 --> 01:14:29.690
我听说了
I've been informed of that.


641
01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:34.570
总督提到报告了吗？
Did the Governor mention the report?


642
01:14:34.690 --> 01:14:36.070
什么报告？
What report?


643
01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:37.900
你知道的
You were told about it.


644
01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:40.980
没有
No.


645
01:14:41.570 --> 01:14:45.360
总督只叫我搬到这里来
The Governor only told me to relocate here.


646
01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:55.440
这里！
Here!


647
01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:01.150
这是给我的
That's for me.


648
01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:12.780
艾米莉亚女士给的鱼
These are doña Emilia's fish.


649
01:15:21.230 --> 01:15:23.110
艾米莉亚女士送的礼物？
Gifts from doña Emilia?


650
01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:27.820
它们是买来的
They were bought.


651
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:30.110
不是礼物
Not gifts.


652
01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:13.820
逾期的付款
Overdue payments.


653
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.280
29乘1000等于29000

654
01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:22.520
减3500等于...
Minus 3,500 already received, makes...


655
01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:26.280
25500

656
01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:32.020
这房子是腐烂透了
This house is rotten.


657
01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.570
休息吧，迭戈先生
Rest, don Diego.


658
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:38.150
密封的信件才是最重要的，费尔南德斯
The sealed letter is the one that counts, Fernández.


659
01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:43.940
穿越海洋去提出申诉...
Crossing the ocean to make a plea...


660
01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.070
慢点来
Take it easy.


661
01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.730
有点烫
It's hot.


662
01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.150
在晚上
At night,


663
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:32.320
我们可以听到很大的噪音
we could hear a great noise.


664
01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:34.400
然后它们就出现了
Then they appeared.


665
01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:36.900
它们是...
They're...


666
01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:39.780
圆形的岩石
round rocks,


667
01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:41.900
像椰子一样
like coconuts,


668
01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:43.520
但却是用石头做的
but made of stone.


669
01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:47.690
它们的内心都充满了珍贵的宝石
And their insides are filled with precious stones.


670
01:18:49.650 --> 01:18:51.150
太漂亮了...
So pretty...


671
01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.020
多么神奇啊！
What marvels!


672
01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:05.570
我不想玷污费尔南德斯的名誉
I wouldn't want to tarnish Fernández's honor.


673
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:08.940
也许应送他去莱尔马
Maybe send him to the city of Lerma,


674
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:11.070
带着推荐信
with a recommendation.


675
01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.320
他还年轻
He's very young.


676
01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:16.650
一段小句应该足够警告了
A minor sentence should be enough warning.


677
01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:20.320
写得好极了
Excellent.


678
01:19:22.650 --> 01:19:24.320
残酷无情
Ruthless.


679
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:28.150
像是...
Such a...


680
01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.520
一只锋利的笔
sharp pen.


681
01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:37.610
阁下能写
Could Your Excellency write


682
01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:40.070
那封你为我的信吗？
that letter you offered me?


683
01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.980
什么信？
What letter?


684
01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.280
写给国王的
The letter to the King,


685
01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:55.070
请求我的调动
requesting my transfer.


686
01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:57.730
当然，你现在是个父亲了
Of course. You're a father now.


687
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:10.400
第一封信很重要
The first letter is very important.


688
01:20:12.230 --> 01:20:14.230
第一封信是什么意思？
What do you mean, the first letter?


689
01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:16.690
一两年后，我们将寄出第二封
In a year or two, we'll send the second one.


690
01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:20.650
陛下直到收到第二封才会考虑这些问题
His Majesty doesn't consider these matters until the second time.


691
01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:25.190
我马上给你发第一封信

692
01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:33.020
我会给你发第一封信的，马上

693
01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:36.820

695

你的头衔令人印象深刻

696
01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.480
你是一个“行政首长”

697
01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:55.480
能找到这样一个任务的志愿者是真是令人惊讶

698

你清楚任务吗？

701
01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:09.820
我们必须除掉维库尼亚·波尔图
We must get rid of Vicuña Porto.


702
01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:12.190
他们打不过我们的，上尉
They won't beat us, Captain.


703
01:22:13.730 --> 01:22:16.190
我们寻求的是恢复商业

704
01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:18.820
我们必须杜绝偷窃

705
01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:20.570
纵火

706
01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:22.900
赌场

707
01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:25.230
我们必须整顿贸易路线

708
01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:29.520
这就是我的政府所要达到的目标

709
01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.230
你来这里多久了？

710
01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:36.610
有一阵子了

好极了

712
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:45.320
我们有你的调动申请

713
01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:52.520
陛下将庆祝这回战事，特别是取得了胜利后
His Majesty will celebrate this return to arms and especially to victory.


714
01:22:52.650 --> 01:22:55.440
我们必须把维库尼亚·波尔图的头带回来

716

为你举行盛大的仪式

717
01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:58.730
我昨晚醒来，发现有东西在我脖子上爬
I woke up last night and felt something crawling on my neck.


718
01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:00.400
我这样弄了一下
I went like this,


719
01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.320
然后感到有些奇怪
and felt something strange.


720
01:24:04.610 --> 01:24:05.980
它在肿胀
It's swollen.


721
01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:13.190
该是蛛蜂
Must be a spider wasp.


722
01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:15.820
不对，是蜘蛛
No. A spider.


723
01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:59.190
是印第安人吗？
Is it an Indian?


724
01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:03.110
如果是的话，就会有银器
If so, there'll be pieces of silver.


725
01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:05.480
是个死人
It's a dead man.


726
01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:13.520
印第安人的独木舟和其他两个被遗弃的东西
The Indians, the canoeist and the other two deserted.


727
01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.650
没银器？
No silver?


728
01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:21.780
什么也没有，只有死人
Nothing, only a dead man.


729
01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:26.320
带些人去抓逃兵！

730
01:25:44.190 --> 01:25:46.610
别动，安静点
Don't move. Be still.


731
01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:57.900
有500人或更多

732
01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:09.020
他们是瞎子
They're the blind.


733
01:26:14.610 --> 01:26:16.690
保持冷静，你就会活下去的

734
01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:42.780
他们受到了惩罚
They were punished.


735
01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:48.900
孩子们是在惩罚后出生的
And the children were born after the punishment.


736
01:26:53.650 --> 01:26:56.110
维库尼亚·波尔图给的惩罚吗？
Punished by Vicuña Porto?


737
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.280
也许是你们这些人给的
Maybe by you people.


738
01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.860
他们带走了马
They took the horses.


739
01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:03.320
对于瞎子来说他们走得很快啊
They walk fast for blind people.


740
01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:08.320
他们走得很快，是为了不让孩子们失望
They walk fast so as not to disappoint their children.


741
01:29:13.230 --> 01:29:16.070
夜晚对瞎子来说更安全
Nighttime is safer for the blind.


742
01:29:21.020 --> 01:29:23.280
我宁愿在白天躲起来
I rather hide during the day.


743
01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:27.980
那是我的剑
That's my sword.


744
01:29:29.610 --> 01:29:31.780
我应该自我介绍一下
I should introduce myself.


745
01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:42.610
我的名字是维库尼亚·波尔图
My name is Vicuña Porto.


746
01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.570
你是？

747
01:29:54.610 --> 01:29:56.780
“行政首长”的名字是什么？
What's the “corregidor”'s name?


748
01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.730
请仁慈点

749
01:30:01.190 --> 01:30:03.190
你说什么？“行政首长”
What did you say, “corregidor”?

- 谁在哪？ - 迭戈·德·扎马
- Who's there? - Diego de Zama.


751
01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:17.070

752
01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:19.400
他们带走了马
They took the horses.


753
01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:24.440
什么都没有留下
There's nothing left.


754
01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:27.320
只要不说出我的名字你就会活下去
Don't say my name and you'll live.


755
01:30:47.610 --> 01:30:49.150
停下！

758
01:30:57.690 --> 01:30:59.440
他们是幻想
They're fantasized.


759
01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:02.480
“幻想？”
"Fantasized?"


760
01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:04.070
伪装者
Disguised.


761

朋友

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.440

他们邀请我们去庆祝会

764

庆祝会？

765
01:31:53.110 --> 01:31:56.730
告诉他们，西班牙国王，这些广大土地的领主

766
01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:59.690
向他问好，表示他的友好

768
01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.940
他们想要动物

769
01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:42.020
“行政首长”有什么建议吗？
Does the "corregidor" have any suggestions?


770
01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:50.780

776
01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:49.150
看见那个拿着刀的人了吗？

那就是维库尼亚·波尔图

叛徒

779
01:38:13.610 --> 01:38:15.780
小心！

我们有吃的了，上尉！

维库尼亚·波尔图！

786
01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:55.650
告诉你的人排队放下武器

788
01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:14.110
叛徒！

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:31.110
气味
That smell.


790
01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:44.780
老虎会闻到那只手臂的气味

791
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:50.320
死肉会使它们好奇

792
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:54.360
但它们并不会吃
But they won't eat it.


793
01:39:57.150 --> 01:39:59.440
相反，它们会攻击我们
Instead, they'll pounce us.


794
01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:20.860
别告诉他们我病了

叛徒

796
01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:34.110
谁在唱歌？
Who's singing?


797
01:40:40.860 --> 01:40:42.520
谁在唱歌？
Who sings?


798
01:41:43.070 --> 01:41:44.820
我犯了罪
I've committed sins.


799
01:41:47.110 --> 01:41:49.150
但不是所有这些...
But not all those...


800
01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:51.360
他们都怪罪于维库尼亚·波尔图
they blame on Vicuña Porto.


801
01:41:53.110 --> 01:41:54.860
明白吗？
Understand?


802
01:41:56.480 --> 01:41:58.070
这就对了
That's right.


803
01:42:03.690 --> 01:42:07.360
他们说的维库尼亚·波尔图根本不存在
The Vicuña Porto they talk about doesn't exist.


804
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:13.520
那不是我

805
01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.110
谁也不是
It's no one.


806
01:42:26.610 --> 01:42:28.400
只是个名字
It's a name.


807
01:42:29.070 --> 01:42:30.650
一个名字而已
A name.


808
01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:33.570
明白吗？
Understand?


809
01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:41.320
我的名字是加斯珀·托莱多
My name is Gaspar Toledo.


810
01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:45.520
这是怎么一回事?
What is it?


811
01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:53.730
我叫什么？“行政首长”
What's my name, "corregidor"?


812
01:42:58.320 --> 01:43:00.480
我不是“行政首长”
I'm not a "corregidor".


813
01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:03.280
这就对了
That's right.


814
01:43:04.110 --> 01:43:06.980
你不是那个“行政首长”
You're not the "corregidor",


815
01:43:07.110 --> 01:43:09.360
我也不是维库尼亚·波尔图
and I'm not Vicuña Porto.


816
01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:11.320
但是...
But...


817
01:43:13.730 --> 01:43:16.020
我的手下想要发财
my men want to get rich.


818
01:43:17.150 --> 01:43:18.730
我的手下
My men


819
01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:21.020
想要发财

820
01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.020
我答应他们会发财的
I promised them it would be so.


821
01:43:29.730 --> 01:43:31.860
我需要“行政首长”

822
01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:34.900
去找到椰子
to find the coconuts.


823
01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:38.650
什么椰子？
What coconuts?


824
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:44.280
你是那个“行政首长”，对吗？
You are the "corregidor", right?


825
01:43:48.650 --> 01:43:50.360
给点水吧！
A little water!


826
01:43:51.570 --> 01:43:53.940
- 上尉想要水？ - 水！
- The captain wants water? - Water!


827
01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:15.690
别看着我，叛徒，连一瞥都别想
Don't look at me, traitor. Not even a glance.


828
01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:17.780
水
Water.


829
01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:24.730
我有一个计划，陛下会奖赏你的
I have a plan. His Majesty will reward you.


830
01:44:27.190 --> 01:44:28.690
我们会带着荣耀回去...
We'll return with honors...


831
01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.480
他们想要发财
They want to get rich.


832
01:45:17.150 --> 01:45:18.360
你说个地方
Name the place.


833
01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.980
北方的任何地方，任何地方都可以
Anywhere North, any place will do.


834
01:45:21.110 --> 01:45:22.520
什么地方？
What place?


835
01:45:23.190 --> 01:45:24.690
椰子在的地方！
Where the coconuts are!


836
01:45:25.610 --> 01:45:27.190
什么椰子？
What coconuts?


837
01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:29.610
你是“行政首长”
You're the "corregidor".


838
01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:31.320
“行政首长”
"Corregidor",


839
01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:35.190
有石头的地方，圆形的石头的地方
the place with the stones, the round stones.


840
01:45:36.110 --> 01:45:38.280
向导不知道这个地方吗？
The guide doesn't know the place?


841
01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:40.570
我没有向导
I'm not a guide.


842
01:45:40.690 --> 01:45:42.780
“行政首长”知道那个地方
The "corregidor" knows the place.


843
01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:45.940
椰子，里面尽是宝石
The coconuts, full of precious stones.


844
01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:49.150
“行政首长”知道...
The "corregidor" knows...


845
01:45:52.480 --> 01:45:54.110
那些宝石头毫无价值
Those stones are worthless.


846
01:45:54.230 --> 01:45:56.320
他在说谎！
He's lying!


847
01:45:59.230 --> 01:46:01.070
它们毫无价值
They're worthless.


848
01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:04.650
叛徒
Traitor.


849
01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:10.320
它们毫无价值
They're worthless.


850
01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:19.020
他在说谎！
He's lying!


851
01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.360
椰子在哪里？
Where are the coconuts?


852
01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:24.940
那些石头毫无价值
Those stones are worthless.


853
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:27.280
石头！
The stones!


854
01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:29.110
他在说谎！
You're lying!


855
01:46:29.730 --> 01:46:30.860
你会死的！
You'll die!


856
01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.820
死神降临到扎马身上！
Death to Zama!


857
01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:34.690
死神！
Death!


858
01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:38.360
快走！
Leave!


859
01:46:39.110 --> 01:46:40.110
快走！
Leave!


860
01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:43.020
我为你做的事从没人为我做过
I do for you what no one did for me.


861
01:46:43.150 --> 01:46:44.360
他要死了
He's lying.


862
01:46:44.480 --> 01:46:45.570
快走！
Leave!


863
01:46:45.690 --> 01:46:47.480
我对你的欲望说不
I say no to your hopes.


864
01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:55.570
死神降临到扎马身上！
Death to Zama!


865
01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:03.320
抓住他
Hold him.


866
01:47:04.610 --> 01:47:06.570
把你的残肢埋到沙子里去
Shove your stumps in the sand.


867
01:47:06.690 --> 01:47:09.190
如果你停止流血了，你就会活下来
If you don't bleed out, you'll survive.


868
01:48:06.020 --> 01:48:08.070
你想活下去吗？
Do you want to live?


869
01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.400
你想活下去吗？
Do you want to live?
