1
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.650
The peaceful moment.

2
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.250
It doesn't really exist.

3
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.330
By the time I finish this sentence...

4
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.050
about seven people around the
world will make a huge mistake.


5
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.690
They call them the Darwin Awards.

6
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.210
In the late '70s, they started
giving out an award each year...


7
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.930
for the person who died
in the most idiotic way.


8
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.970
The idea being, these people's
actions are so moronic...


9
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.730
they're actually improving the gene
pool by removing themselves from it.


10
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.850
For instance, Trip Hansen, an ad executive...

11
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.330
was showing off his new penthouse office.

12
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.330
Oh, man. Instant fuck pad.

13
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.250
You lucky bastard.

14
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.850
That glass? Four-ply.

15
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.770
- Bulletproof.
- Bullshit.


16
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.490
All right.

17
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.050
What are you doing?

18
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.170
Walkin' the talk.

19
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.890
- No, no, no, no!
- He runs at the window.


20
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.810
You know, to prove it was shatterproof.

21
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.890
Holy shit!

22
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.130
Turns out it wasn't.

23
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.850
Everybody's gotta have a hobby.
For me, it was the Darwin Awards.


24
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.770
There we are.

25
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.650
Okay, I guess you could say it
was actually more of an obsession.


26
00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.210
But I just couldn't help trying to imagine...

27
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.650
what type of personality it would
take to meet such strange fates.


28
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.050
Why am I so obsessed with
analyzing personalities?


29
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.930
Well, that's my dayjob.

30
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.450
I'm a criminal profiler
for the S.F.P.D., Homicide.


31
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.490
Hey. Hey. Hey. Stay on
the other side of the tape.


32
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.370
Oh, you got it. You got it.
Behind this tape. Perfect.


33
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.170
That numb-nuts have
clearance to be here?


34
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.970
The chief said I'd been selected to be
followed around by this documentary filmmaker.


35
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.450
Said it would be good for P.R.

36
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.730
Truthfully, hejust seems
like some kid out of college.


37
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.610
You know, originally when
you asked about filming me...


38
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.050
I thought you meant a couple of hours.

39
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.970
It's been two days.

40
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.770
Just keep going about your
job as if I'm not here.


41
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.490
Just pretend I'm invisible.

42
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.570
This guy was starting
to get on my nerves.

43
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.410
What are you eating?

44
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.690
- You still here?
- What were you dreaming about?


45
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.330
Why liquid soap?

46
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.930
I'm considered the best profiler on the force.

47
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.650
It's a talent that
began back in fourth grade.

48
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.730
I see a couple problems with your story.

49
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.650
What problem?

50
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.010
First, you had to have been
in the liquor store alone.


51
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.610
Second, he was a Seventh-day Adventist...

52
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.650
so why would he
be in the liquor store?

53
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.930
It's not fair we have to do recess
inside all year 'cause of you.


54
00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.570
- Who says I did it?
- You have a problem with authority.


55
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.490
Miss Fong flunked you in math.

56
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.850
And... the wood chips on the strongbox
matches your Louisville Slugger exactly.


57
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.890
You tell Miss Fong, and
it's your ass, Burrows!


58
00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.170
Fourth grade was also the beginning
of another lifelong condition.


59
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.650
- Hematophobia. Fainting
response to the sight ofblood.


60
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.090
My ability to connect the facts...

61
00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.050
never really helped my popularity...

62
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.970
but at least it provided a job.

63
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.490
- We got plenty of Polaroids.
- These are digital.


64
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.970
I'm takin' a extra set. 
You know, for Burrows.

65
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.450
If that little shit wants to help
out with this investigation...


66
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.890
let him get his ass down
here just like everybody else.


67
00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.930
He did. He's outside.

68
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.330
So...

69
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.210
what made you choose me
for this project anyway?


70
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.730
You were the only one on the
force who agreed to do it.


71
00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.650
Oh.

72
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.770
Five dead in four weeks.

73
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.210
It seemed like a serial case,
and no one could solve it.


74
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.650
That meant it fell in my lap.

75
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.170
- Hi, Bill.
- Okay.


76
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.290
Give me perps under six
feet with size 14 shoes.


77
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.770
Check the clothing records
at Quentin and Folsom.


78
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.450
S.F.P.D. here. 
Working overtime.

79
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.530
Just ignore the camera.

80
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.290
- It's not all doughnuts and broads.
- Oh, please. Don't encourage him.


81
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:50.690
Nobody under six feet's gonna have size 14...

82
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.130
Whoa! Look at this.

83
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.130
At least 378 people do.

84
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.090
Those footprints were
half as deep as the others.


85
00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.650
Guy couldn't have weighed more than 140.

86
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.810
- Isolate for guys with some college. Lit majors.
- Why?


87
00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.930
Locations of the attacks...
Hughes Laundromat...


88
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.850
Gates Apartments, 
Eliot Business College...

89
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.370
They're all names of poets.

90
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.250
Here's your short lit
major cons with big feet.


91
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.850
I'd suggest you bring all five of'em in.

92
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.410
This perp's gonna be in deep hiding.

93
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.450
Criminology 101. Serial killers always
follow the investigation of their crime.


94
00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.450
"Hematophobia. Debilitating
disorder, unresponsive to treatment."


95
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.730
Another fuckin' useless book.

96
00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.530
You should leave. Now. Leave.

97
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.450
Police! Follow my command!
Move down here nice and slow.


98
00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.370
Nice and slow. That's it.

99
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.290
- What is this? Cops?
- Get down on your knees!


100
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.530
Get on your knees! Interlace
your fingers behind your head!


101
00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.290
- Call 911.
- I can't interfere. I have to keep filming.


102
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.650
- What?
- It's part of the documentary process, man.


103
00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.530
- You have to remain an objective observer.
- You're fucking useless.


104
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.450
Yeah. This is Officer Burrows.

105
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.410
I need immediate backup on
Columbus and Kerouac. Yeah.


106
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.490
Am I gonna have to sign a release?

107
00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.530
Shut the fuck up!

108
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.170
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.


109
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:44.730
"This is the way the world ends.
Not with a bang but a whimper."


110
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.530
That is the most over-quoted
poem in modern lit.


111
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.450
What? Did you have to memorize that
for your 11 th grade English class?


112
00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.370
Fuck off.

113
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.850
Well, then.

114
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:04.050
Oh, my God.

115
00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:07.330
- Turn it off. Turn it the fuck off!
- Please don't. No, please don't.


116
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:05.690
Isn't this over? 
I'm not a cop anymore.

117
00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:10.250
- There's nothing left to film.
- A documentary is like a river.


118
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.170
You follow its natural course until it's...

119
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.250
Oh, just shut up and give
me back the apartment keys.


120
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:29.210
What are you doin'?

121
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.650
- If I tell you, will you go away?
- For tonight.


122
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.490
I'm looking at all
the bills I can't pay...

123
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:41.290
Rent, Visa, electricity, insurance.

124
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:46.850
Okay, what's goin'on?

125
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.010
What's that?

126
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.170
What are you doin'? What's that?

127
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.770
You can't follow me.

128
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.490
- What did you say this was for?
- Student film.


129
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.250
It's also a helpful research tool.

130
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.170
Mr. Burrows...

131
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:20.210
First Fidelity Life and Casualty already has
the most complete profiles in the business.


132
00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:24.330
Yeah, you've got risk profiles for heart
disease, cancer, even drunk driving.


133
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.250
But nothing for these Darwin Award types.

134
00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:29.130
But you have no experience
in insurance profiles.


135
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:33.170
I was the best on the force at personality
profiles... Predicting people's behavior.


136
00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:35.970
Yeah, but we already have
a full staff of actuaries...


137
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.290
I can tell you what kind
of underwear you're wearing.


138
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.210
- Excuse me?...
- Bikini-cut briefs.


139
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.650
Color? Probably red.

140
00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.130
- No, make that black.
- How do you...


141
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:48.370
If that were the case, how would you...

142
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.290
You have pictures of your wife
on your desk, but not of children.


143
00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.490
Bikini-cut briefs drastically
reduce a man's fertility.


144
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:57.170
Being in the insurance industry,
my guess is you're aware of this...


145
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.010
and your fertility restriction is by design.

146
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.410
Probably 'cause you're having an affair.

147
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:07.250
Given your age andjob status, there's a

148
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:11.330
But the two gifts in your
office make it a certainty.


149
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:15.330
One from Gump's, obviously for your wife...

150
00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.290
probably bought out of guilt.

151
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:22.810
The other, from Sugarpuss on Haight Street...

152
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:26.490
which, let's just say, is not
where one shops for their wife.


153
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:31.810
According to psychological studies...

154
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.810
black is the color chosen by men
in midlife crisis trying to rebel...


155
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.570
but who, in fact, are
simply... terrified of death.


156
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:44.610
Damn.

157
00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.650
- Could you turn the camera off, please?
- You got it.


158
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:52.250
Why...

159
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:57.050
Why should First Fidelity
care about these Darwin cases?


160
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:02.490
The cases I describe in my report cost
your company $22 million per annum.


161
00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:05.410
- That's last year alone.
- Jesus.


162
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:08.730
- You said there's no profile.
- Right.


163
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.490
Well, we create one.

164
00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:15.010
You can predict a person's
fate based on three traits.


165
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:20.050
For instance, if you weigh over 250
pounds, use bar soap rather than liquid...


166
00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.930
and don't have a nonskid surface in
your shower, you have a 2.2% chance of...


167
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.090
That's worldwide.

168
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:30.610
Sad thing is, 90% of these
accidents are preventable.


169
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:35.130
Just requires a little precaution.

170
00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.250
Get someone to study
these Darwin Award types...


171
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:46.210
find three common risk
factors, you got your profile.


172
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.650
Screen against this profile,
you'll save $22 million per annum.


173
00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.850
Okay. Okay. You begin immediately...

174
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.690
and, um, you start with... with those.

175
00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.210
These cases are all over the
country. See, I don't travel.


176
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:05.810
- I've never been out of San Francisco.
- Well, that's a deal-breaker.


177
00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:09.290
You have four weeks to prove your theory.
If you're right, you have a job. If not...


178
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:11.010
Four weeks isn't nearly enough time.

179
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.730
I'm gonna pair you with a claims investigator.

180
00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:19.050
And she specializes in, um, unusual cases.

181
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.570
Jim, you mind?

182
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.490
Zippy Cola is a client of First Fidelity.

183
00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.290
They've got a potential wrongful
death suit on their hands.


184
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.450
You nervous?

185
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.370
No. Feels good to be working again.

186
00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.370
That's a lot ofblood.

187
00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.490
Ugh. Gross.

188
00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.490
Could you please not... Oh, my God.

189
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.450
Yeah. I've got enough for now.

190
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:23.010
Has anybody checked the coins?

191
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:24.890
Who the hell's this guy?

192
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.530
Who the fuck is this guy?

193
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.450
I have everything I need. Thank you.

194
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.930
I just noticed his right sleeve is ripped.

195
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:40.650
Seriously. Who the fuck are you and
what the fuck is this camera doing here?


196
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:45.010
Hello? Can you look at me
when I'm talking to you?


197
00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:46.930
Are you crazy?

198
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:48.890
My name is Burrows and...

199
00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.330
Are you all right?

200
00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.810
Of course. Just a little light-headed.

201
00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.090
Listen.

202
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.090
I'm Siri Taylor. 
I'm the claims investigator.

203
00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.450
And, uh, you are here only to observe.

204
00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:15.930
So if you get another theory
about our client's liability...


205
00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:19.770
Well, I do have a theory
regarding your client's liability.


206
00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.810
People think motive analysis is unimaginative.

207
00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:25.170
It's actually the opposite.

208
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:28.090
If you imagine all the possible scenarios...

209
00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:31.770
you'll find the one most likely.

210
00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.530
Who... is in fact... your daddy?

211
00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.490
I am.

212
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.370
Come on!

213
00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:59.290
Piece of shit!

214
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:07.130
You like that? Come to papa.

215
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.090
Come to papi.

216
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.970
Oh. Oh, shit.

217
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.730
Any second now you can go ahead
and... wipe that smile off your face.


218
00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:39.770
Hello?

219
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.930
I'm actually originally from South Bend.

220
00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:48.730
I moved here for love. I know. It's,
like, the oldest story in the book.


221
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:52.130
I needed my space, and much like you...

222
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.730
she, uh, wouldn't let me go.

223
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.890
Hey. Hey!

224
00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.170
Hey! Hey! I'm in here!

225
00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.850
Hey! Hello!

226
00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:07.130
You minimum-wage asshole!

227
00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:10.010
I'm in here! Motherfucker.

228
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:12.690
Oh, shit.

229
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.570
The building will be
closed till Monday morning.


230
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.010
Have a nice weekend.

231
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:26.250
That's great.

232
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:37.490
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

233
00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.490
Guys like Emile here...

234
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:45.290
they spend their whole
lives testing the system.


235
00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.770
Sooner or later, it's
gonna catch up with 'em.

236
00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.690
This is the way the world ends.

237
00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.130
First of all, theories are bullshit.

238
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.450
"B", the legs on that machine, they failed.

239
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:10.970
So we have liability. Thirdly,
this dickhead has to go.


240
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:15.770
- It was criminal tampering.
- We only deal in hard proof.


241
00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.690
Open up the machine. Check
the inside for his prints.


242
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:21.490
Okay. You want enough rope
to hang yourself? Fine.


243
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:26.010
One condition. You're wrong, and
you get some other investigator.


244
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.450
All right. All right.

245
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:33.970
But if I'm right, we investigate
my bullshit theories on these cases.


246
00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:44.130
Hmm.

247
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.490
The deceased's prints coat
the inside of all the machines.


248
00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:49.410
You on the job?

249
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:52.170
Used to be. S.F.P.D.

250
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:59.610
Also seems I've saved Zippy Cola
from a multimillion-dollar suit.


251
00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.330
There's a non-tampering clause. See?

252
00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.050
- Does that help Emile Travers?
- No.


253
00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.010
But he was clearly in the wrong.

254
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:19.650
Oh, God. What the hell are you doing?

255
00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:23.930
Just analyzing motivation.

256
00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.610
Analyzing motivation.

257
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:29.330
It's simple. Greedy
bastard didn't want to pay.


258
00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:32.450
Got his hand caught in the cookie jar.

259
00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:35.090
It's not a question of greed.
Travers made over six figures.


260
00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:38.490
He could afford cheese
crackers. He did it to win.


261
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:41.410
- To feel like he was beating the system.
- Fascinating.


262
00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:46.250
So, tell me. Why are we going all
the way to fucking Minnesota...


263
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:49.010
for a simple stolen car claim?

264
00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.170
I picked Minnesota...

265
00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:55.730
- 'cause the town hasn't had a stolen car in 42 years.
- So?


266
00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.930
So, the chances of a
brand-new car being stolen...


267
00:19:58.970 --> 00:20:02.570
in a town that hasn't had a
theft in 42 years is 3,000-to-1.


268
00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.410
Oh, thank you.

269
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.770
- Thank you.
- I ordered steamed vegetables.


270
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.850
Yeah, you know, hot dish is
all we have after breakfast.


271
00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.210
- What is that?
- A spork.


272
00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:21.730
A spork.

273
00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:24.050
Combination of spoon and fork.

274
00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.890
Right.

275
00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.050
Of course. Of course.

276
00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.010
For an ex-cop, you're kind
of a pussy, aren't you?


277
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.850
I'm not used to traveling. So what?

278
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.010
I'm not talking about that. The cashier.

279
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.290
You've been checking her
out for, like, 20 minutes...


280
00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.250
but you haven't said anything.

281
00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:50.930
I don't have time to...

282
00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:52.850
- I'm here to concentrate on work.
- Right.


283
00:20:52.930 --> 00:20:54.770
Okay, listen, Casanova.

284
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:57.930
When we go to interview this car
claim, just let me do the talking.


285
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.850
All right?

286
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.090
Spork.

287
00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:23.250
First rule of investigation:
Notice everything.


288
00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:27.290
- Would you like a cookie?
- Oh, no, thank you.


289
00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:29.650
Um, according to the form here, Mr. Sparrow...

290
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.250
it says the men took the car
from you at gunpoint, correct?


291
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.730
- Yeah, that's how Bob got shot.
- How completely terrifying.


292
00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:41.050
Um, could you, for the record, just
repeat the description of the men?


293
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:44.530
Oh, well, they were, uh, bad guys.

294
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.730
They were definitely, uh,
you know, from the city there.


295
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.650
They weren't from around
here. I would have known 'em.


296
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.890
Okay, so, bad men from the city.

297
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:56.890
Thank you, Mr. Sparrow. We're done.

298
00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:58.970
- We're what?
- Done.


299
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:03.290
Oh, I don't want any trouble. I just...
I want the money back for my truck, is all.


300
00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.290
Why are you making it so complicated?

301
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:07.810
I go through a hundred cases a year.

302
00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:11.930
Ninety-nine percent of them
are just plain accidents.


303
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:16.850
I mean, if he was lying...
The things, they just happen. It's fate.


304
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:19.970
I believe in behavior, not fate.

305
00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:22.010
So lightning comes shooting out of the sky...

306
00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:24.410
and you're gonna blame the
poor slob who got hit by it?


307
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:28.690
If he's playing golf
during a thunderstorm, yes!


308
00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.610
God.

309
00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.050
Well, so what if I just decided to walk
out here on the oh-so-dangerous ice.


310
00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:38.290
No, no. I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

311
00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:41.610
Yeah, you probably wouldn't unzip your
fly without assessing the risk first.


312
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.770
You know, you're being
stupid. You're not being funny.


313
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:47.410
And 20% of back injuries occur on...
Siri!


314
00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:52.610
I'm coming! Shit.

315
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:58.530
You all right?

316
00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:03.730
No. Yeah. I mean... 
It's just the fish.

317
00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:08.530
Oh, Jesus. Sounds like you have a concussion.

318
00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:15.730
No. No, dummy. 
The fish in the trees.

319
00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:17.490
The fish in the...

320
00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.410
Everywhere.

321
00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:38.850
They have carbon burns on them.

322
00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.410
In this culture, the number

323
00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:55.010
There's a rise in recreational accidents
for men between the ages 40 and 42.


324
00:23:55.090 --> 00:24:00.090
Probably because men of that age can afford
the recreational equipment to do the damage.


325
00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.490
Damn.

326
00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:07.210
- Goddamn.
- That's right. Goddamn.


327
00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:09.490
- Uh, what's she get per gallon?
- Who gives a shit?


328
00:24:14.130 --> 00:24:16.650
- Ow!
- Watch the tire.


329
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:19.570
Oh, yeah!

330
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.290
- Ten cylinders, fuel injected!
- Fuck you!


331
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.570
Okay? Fuck you for having
this truck before I did!


332
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:26.490
Yeah, fuck me is right, eh?

333
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:29.650
Sparrow had been in three vehicular accidents.

334
00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:31.650
- Ready, Max?
- But other than that, his record was clean.


335
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:33.290
Come on, boy. Come on.

336
00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:36.530
Max! Good boy, Max.

337
00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.730
This lake sucks. 
All the ducks are gone!

338
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:45.250
- Let's get some fish.
- Yeah! Ice fishin'!


339
00:24:50.530 --> 00:24:54.730
- This is gonna take an hour!
- I got a better idea.


340
00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:59.730
Recreational use ofhigh explosives
is illegal in all 50 states.


341
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.370
But about 3,000 times a year, men
like Tom Sparrow seem to find them.


342
00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:07.570
- Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I got this from Wally down at the plant.


343
00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:09.890
Well, I figure instead of busting our asses...

344
00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:12.250
diggin' a hole in
there, we'll just use this.

345
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:16.850
Hey, shit. Be careful with that.

346
00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:19.170
Relax, it's got an extra-long fuse.

347
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:21.330
Besides, I almost made
quarterback in high school.


348
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.890
- Jesus Christ!
- What are you doin'?


349
00:25:23.970 --> 00:25:26.130
Stop fuckin' around! Throw it!

350
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:32.570
Man.

351
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:37.130
- This is what it's all about.
- I guess.


352
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.090
Heel, Max!

353
00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.730
- You know, Max could get hurt.
- Heel, Max! Heel!


354
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:51.530
He's fetching! Drop it!

355
00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.530
Drop it, Max! Drop it!

356
00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.610
Tom, what do we do now?

357
00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.250
Run!

358
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.170
Run!

359
00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:15.810
- Whoa! Fuck.
- We gotta shoot!


360
00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:28.050
No, Max!

361
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.770
- No!
- Fuck!


362
00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.890
Oh!

363
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:46.130
Bob! It's freezing!

364
00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.690
- Hold up! Hold up!
- One thing I've learned studying people.


365
00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:56.010
Bravery and stupidity aren't
mutually exclusive traits.


366
00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:00.370
In fact, you might argue
they're one and the same.


367
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:04.930
Bob! Oh! Bob!

368
00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:21.530
Hey. You're zoning out again.

369
00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:27.170
I want to go to the hospital.
Visit the one who was shot.


370
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.970
Oh, come on. Come on. We're
behind schedule already.


371
00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:33.530
Besides, the case is closed.
You didn't learn anything.


372
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.530
Correction. We learned he had
a history of military surplus...


373
00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.210
car accidents, and he's a second child.

374
00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.010
Just like Emile Travers.

375
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:45.650
Hey, you just hate the fact
that the rookie solved the case.


376
00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.370
- Hey! Who found the fish?
- You fell.


377
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.690
It's not like you thought, "I'm gonna
lie down and look for fish in the trees."


378
00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.210
- You fell.
- Fine, yeah, I fell. Falling.


379
00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.570
Something you wouldn't have thought to do...

380
00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.690
because you're too chickenshit to
go out on the ice in the first place.


381
00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:07.530
Laughing is not objective.

382
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:13.290
Before, these Darwin cases
werejust a puzzle to solve.


383
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.530
Now I was connecting
them to names and faces.

384
00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:20.650
I wasn't satisfiedjust studying
these accidents anymore.


385
00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:23.170
I wanted to find
a way to prevent them.

386
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:35.690
Sorry. Nurse!

387
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:49.330
Can you speed up a little bit?

388
00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.090
Two-lane highways with broken
lines are the most dangerous roads.


389
00:28:53.170 --> 00:28:56.850
Seventy percent of accidents
occur over the speed limit.


390
00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:00.930
You're going 35 in a

391
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:05.210
Most studies have a
plus or minus 10% error.

392
00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:08.570
I'm correcting for that.

393
00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.250
- What is this?
- The Piano Man.


394
00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.130
He rocks. He's a musical genius.

395
00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:29.210
It's been proven that
soft music reduces stress.


396
00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:32.130
- Lost your crazy mind.
- Too hard-core for you?


397
00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.050
Fuck.

398
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.810
What's so unusual about
this life insurance claim...


399
00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:14.930
that we're driving all the way to Nevada?

400
00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:17.850
There's no body. No leads.

401
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:21.170
Except for one unusual piece of evidence.

402
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.850
Forget it. Got nothin'.

403
00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.210
No wreckage.

404
00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.290
How far do the skid marks extend?

405
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:35.250
Uh, 2.8 miles.

406
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.770
No. You didn't look far enough.

407
00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.650
Listen, buddy, it's over.

408
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:46.850
We've got a million-dollar life
insurance claim and no body.


409
00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:49.450
How do you explain these?

410
00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.690
You know what? It's not my
job to, unless there's a body.


411
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:56.690
Didn't you stop to think something
leaving a 2.8 mile skid mark...


412
00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.930
was going inexplicably fast?

413
00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.970
Listen, we searched a hundred-yard radius...

414
00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:06.690
on both sides of
the skids and found nothing.

415
00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.810
No. I mean really fast.

416
00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.250
There's metal in the skid
marks melted to the pavement.


417
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:16.290
From what?

418
00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.610
Melted wheels.

419
00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.530
When a man oflimited means...

420
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:27.570
has a million-dollar life insurance
policy, it raises questions.


421
00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.050
Foul play by the beneficiary
must always be considered.


422
00:31:32.170 --> 00:31:35.410
Suicide, if proven, is cause for cancellation.

423
00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.290
You like her, don't you?

424
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:52.810
That's a bullshit question.

425
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:54.770
Now why is it a bullshit question?

426
00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:03.610
You see, your whole "film school"
objective observer theory is bullshit.


427
00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:07.410
You're trying to get me to say certain
things to create some kind of story.


428
00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:09.450
Hey, it's all real footage, man.

429
00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:15.130
No. It's the 90 minutes of footage you're
gonna choose from hundreds of hours of tape.


430
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.010
Then you're gonna edit it to make
someone look like the bad guy...


431
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:20.490
or someone look like the hero.

432
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:24.530
The only problem is,
there are no heroes here.

433
00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.610
Ow!

434
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:37.370
Harvey! Will you cut that racket out?

435
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:41.370
In many ways, Harvey was
a model X-factor candidate.


436
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:44.050
He had the classic
second-child personalities.


437
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:48.690
Stan, do you ever get the feeling
there's a whole other world out there?


438
00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.690
What? Like Europe?

439
00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:58.450
On the surface, a second
child is a responsible citizen.


440
00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.210
Premium, right?

441
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.810
No. Mid-grade's fine. Thanks.

442
00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.770
This has got fuel injection.
You want it to run clean.


443
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.210
Just mid-grade.

444
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:17.170
But boiling just below the
exterior of the second child...


445
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:20.850
is a competitive risk
taker who craves attention.


446
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:23.010
Been working on my own car a bit.

447
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:26.530
She ain't much, but she's
got a hell of a lot of torque.


448
00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:31.010
Keep the change.

449
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.530
Oh, faster!

450
00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:42.450
You can go faster, baby.

451
00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.530
Oh, as fast as you can. Come on.

452
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:51.530
Oh! Go as fast as you can, please?

453
00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:55.730
No, faster! You can go faster, baby, please?

454
00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.970
All right, I'll go
as fast as I can.

455
00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:07.930
- That's it.
- What's it?


456
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.290
One of the largest safety risks...

457
00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.210
is the unregulated sale of military surplus.

458
00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.450
Whoa. Whoa.

459
00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:17.370
Man. Huh. You guys are mad at somebody.

460
00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:20.290
Hey, Harvey, grenades.

461
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.250
Oh, I wouldn't touch
that if I was you.

462
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:25.330
- Why? Is it live?
- Legally, we can't give you an answer to that question.


463
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.050
- That's pretty cool.
- How many of these do you have?


464
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.010
Well, how many do you need?

465
00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.930
Hey, Harvey. Look at that.

466
00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:34.610
Am I good? Or am I bad?

467
00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:36.650
I don't know. Somewhere in between, probably.

468
00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:47.170
- What the hell is that?
- Ain't for sale.


469
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.570
- Not for sale?
- Barry, you know I've been saving that thing.


470
00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:53.170
- For what?
- I don't know.


471
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:56.930
- How much?
- I got that from one of those boys on the military base.


472
00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:59.250
What in God's name you wanna
do with that thing, Harvey?


473
00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:16.770
Joleen, are you proud of me?

474
00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:25.450
Like on TV, when you see
someone do something incredible.


475
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:29.050
Think I could be someone like that?

476
00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:34.970
I don't know. I've never met
anybody incredible before.


477
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.250
Stan, this is your station.

478
00:36:56.330 --> 00:36:58.170
I'm gonna go a
mile back up the road.

479
00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.090
Well, how can I film it?

480
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:03.250
Don't worry. I'll be
coming by in no time at all.


481
00:37:03.330 --> 00:37:05.770
As soon as you hear the
ignition, start filming.


482
00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:11.090
Okay. Harvey, you know, if we film
this we're not gonna get in trouble?


483
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.490
- 'Cause I'm on that probation.
- No, Stan.


484
00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:17.250
We're not gonna be in
trouble. We're gonna be on TV.


485
00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.970
Okay.

486
00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:22.810
Harvey, you're not gonna
get yourself hurt, right?


487
00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:26.930
Nah, don't worry. I'm not
gonna let anything happen.


488
00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:32.610
Harvey. Am I good, or am I bad?

489
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:36.730
You're just a little bit bad.

490
00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.810
But what's wrong with that?

491
00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:43.970
- The JATO rocket is designed to add thrust...
- Careful.


492
00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:47.210
...to overloaded transport planes like C-130s...

493
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:52.090
which, fully loaded, weigh
in excess of 200 tons.


494
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.970
Harvey's Chevy weighed less than two.

495
00:38:07.450 --> 00:38:12.210
Harvey accelerated to 50 miles per hour
before he began the ignition sequence.


496
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:21.730
The first two switches mixed the fluids.

497
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:27.010
Once mixed, they become one of the
most potent rocket fuels on earth...


498
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:32.050
unleashing a force beyond the
imagination of Harvey Wedstone.


499
00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:38.930
Okay. Harvey should be
here in about five minutes.


500
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.330
I'm not sure if this is gonna work.

501
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:45.170
By the time Harvey hit the brakes...

502
00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:48.210
the car was already
going 250 miles per hour.

503
00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:50.610
Then the peak burn hit.

504
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:52.850
Oh, my God!

505
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.570
Harvey managed to pull the parking brake.

506
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.970
This would have been of no use...

507
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.450
because at 300 miles per
hour the tires melted.


508
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:25.650
Tellis Pearlman saw his fate coming
from the east at 400 miles per hour.


509
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:31.250
Forces usually reserved for wind tunnel
tests were now ripping the car apart.


510
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:43.370
The more I learn about this man,
the more I feel a strange admiration.


511
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.850
Harvey made a brave decision.

512
00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:52.290
With three seconds ofburn left, Harvey
veered out of the Pearlmans'way...


513
00:39:52.370 --> 00:39:55.330
hitting the sloped shoulder.

514
00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:03.090
The trajectory sent Harvey
to an apex of 300 feet.


515
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:13.490
I did it! I fucking did something!

516
00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.650
What happened?

517
00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:30.050
Nothing. I fell asleep at the wheel.

518
00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.450
Kids, kids. Quiet.

519
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.410
Your father's lost his mind again.

520
00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:39.090
Two days later, Pearlman
reported to the air force...


521
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.290
a U.F.O. that came and
went in the blink of an eye.


522
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:44.450
Mama!

523
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:48.210
- Stan, reverting to his criminal instincts, ran.
- Mama!


524
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:51.370
Okay, well, um, it was coming toward...

525
00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.370
It was like a flashlight,
and there was an explosion.


526
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:55.250
It was going about 3,000 miles an hour.

527
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:59.610
- 3,000 miles an hour?
- At least 3,400 miles.


528
00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.530
Very fast.

529
00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.930
Mr. Pearlman, could it
have been your imagination?


530
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:06.930
He has no imagination! 
He's completely insane.

531
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:10.010
He ordered 22 cases of paper towels.
Had them shipped to the house.


532
00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.490
And you don't have a history of narcotics.

533
00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:16.010
It happened. I was driving
with my family in the car.


534
00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:18.370
I had my children in the
back, and it happened.


535
00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:21.290
One more second and we would
have just been in an accident.


536
00:41:21.370 --> 00:41:23.450
Siri, he saved the Pearlmans'lives.

537
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.370
He's actually kind of a hero.

538
00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:27.290
What? Listen.

539
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:29.210
Two years ago in Louisiana...

540
00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:32.290
a single mother and her three
kids lost their house in a flood.


541
00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:35.890
I had to look her in the
eyes and deny that claim.


542
00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:38.570
I am sure as hell not gonna
give a million dollars...


543
00:41:38.610 --> 00:41:42.130
to some idiot who strapped a JATO
rocket to the back of his Chevy.


544
00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:44.330
Look at the trajectory. 
He was home free.

545
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:46.770
The rocket was burned out, then he swerved.

546
00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:49.210
- The claim is rejected.
- What?


547
00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:53.490
Man, you are losing it. We've
got, like, 20 minutes. Come on.


548
00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:56.570
Jesus.

549
00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.930
Don't you have to go back
to school at some point?


550
00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:02.570
- This is my thesis project. I can take as long as I want.
- Great.


551
00:42:02.610 --> 00:42:06.290
Could you be any louder and more obnoxious?

552
00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:21.210
"You can't beat me, but
keep fishing for clues."


553
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:23.170
God, don't you ever stop?

554
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:26.410
If I don't meet this deadline...

555
00:42:26.450 --> 00:42:30.170
my life, the one I
was planning for, is over.

556
00:42:30.250 --> 00:42:34.610
It's just that it's always
steamed vegetables...


557
00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:37.290
and safety belts with you.

558
00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.330
Doing the right thing.

559
00:42:39.410 --> 00:42:43.410
It's like you're... you're
punching a clock 24-7.


560
00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:45.890
Well, the world's a dangerous place 24-7...

561
00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:51.650
and if you're weak or you make a mistake
at a wrong moment, somebody gets hurt.


562
00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:55.850
Somebody maybe even dies.

563
00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:01.130
And it doesn't help when someone won't
make a lousy cell phone call for you...


564
00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:03.050
at a critical moment.

565
00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:09.010
Burrows. So what is it? You
want us all to live to be 100?


566
00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:11.290
Sure. Why not? 
I'd love to live to 100.

567
00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:18.250
Even if it meant giving up everything
and basically having no life at all?


568
00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:20.290
I think I got a pretty
good life, actually, Siri.


569
00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:24.650
What am I giving up? Uh, hot
dogs? Cigarettes? Explosives?


570
00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:27.730
You know what I mean. Come on.

571
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:38.690
Mmm!

572
00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:51.850
See the girl behind the counter?

573
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:55.450
Tell her I'm your fiancĂ©e, and I
just broke it off. Broke your heart.


574
00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:58.050
Then ask her for a drink
when she gets off work.


575
00:43:58.090 --> 00:44:01.090
Um, you know, a shoulder to
cry on, that type of thing.


576
00:44:01.130 --> 00:44:05.290
Now, when she says yes, play track
two off Wilco's Summer Teeth album.


577
00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:07.210
It's in the car.

578
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:10.730
I have no intention of, um...

579
00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:14.770
And even if I did, I certainly
wouldn't use Wilco. Wilco?


580
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.410
You don't deserve Wilco. 
Just trust me.

581
00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:23.770
Look at her. She's
totally small-town America.


582
00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.690
She's probably desperate.

583
00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:28.970
If you have any kind
of pulse, you'll do it.

584
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:32.250
It's over! We're through!

585
00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:43.410
You even begin to follow me over there,
and that's it, this is over. Got it?


586
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:45.770
Yeah, good.

587
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:52.970
Here...

588
00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:57.610
Did she say yes?

589
00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:00.770
Her name's Zoe. 
Meeting her at 11:00.

590
00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:08.290
What do you think of when you hear
the phrase, "You can't beat me?"


591
00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.250
Um, sex?

592
00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:23.610
Damn.

593
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:34.610
Death trap.

594
00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:42.490
Always be prepared.

595
00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.890
Oh, yeah.

596
00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.570
Goddamn!

597
00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:20.930
God! Thank you, Jesus.

598
00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.130
Oh, God! Jesus!

599
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:29.770
If you have a
soul, you will help me.

600
00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:32.810
You know how war photographers can't interfere
no matter what atrocity is being committed...


601
00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.210
No!

602
00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:38.450
You will burn in hell for this.

603
00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:43.250
Help! Help!

604
00:46:44.570 --> 00:46:48.090
Help! Help!

605
00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:53.050
- Burrows?
- Help!


606
00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:56.730
- Help!
- Sorry.


607
00:46:58.330 --> 00:47:02.890
And I didn't even think you
knew how to have a good time!


608
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:06.330
I was just, the... It was...
I was trying to avoid the...


609
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:11.090
Let's just skip the
explanations and get you down.


610
00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:16.850
Wait a minute.
You just stood there, not helping him?


611
00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:19.330
Well, see, the main ethic of
documentary film prevents me from...


612
00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:22.370
That's a really expensive
camera you've got there.


613
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:26.770
Yeah, actually. Kind of is. No,
please don't. No, please don't.


614
00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:31.770
Let's just try to get you down.

615
00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:37.370
What do you think of when you hear
the phrase, "You can't beat me?"


616
00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:40.290
Please don't ask me that right now.

617
00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.850
No, wait...
Ooh! Wait, wait, don't!


618
00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:48.690
Yeah, but this is where
the knot is. I have to.


619
00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:57.170
Look, I'm real flattered, but that is
not gonna help loosen anything up right now.


620
00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:59.930
It's the straps.
I mean the the circulation.


621
00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:02.250
Oh, boy. Okay, I got an idea. 
I have an idea.

622
00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:04.250
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Okay.


623
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:08.930
- What?
- One, two, three!


624
00:48:08.970 --> 00:48:11.410
- Ow! God!
- Are you okay there?


625
00:48:14.610 --> 00:48:16.490
Hello?

626
00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:18.650
- Michael?
- Oh, yeah.


627
00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:20.570
Yeah. He's right here.

628
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:22.970
It's your date.

629
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:25.770
- Hello?
- Hello?


630
00:48:25.850 --> 00:48:28.650
Oh, hi. It's you. Yeah.

631
00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:30.690
Uh, that was my business partner. We're just...

632
00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:32.650
Well, she's helping me...
...making me...


633
00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:36.050
- Ah! God!
- Are you okay?


634
00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.810
Just figured something out. Ah, yeah. Yeah.

635
00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:39.210
That's it!

636
00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:42.370
Good. There's this Polynesian
place around the corner.


637
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:45.370
They make really big drinks, and you
can share them, and they have live music.


638
00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:47.290
- It's sort of like Don Ho.
- Yeah. Listen.


639
00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:50.890
I'm right in the thick of... In the
middle of something.


640
00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.690
I think I should be with you shortly.

641
00:48:53.770 --> 00:48:55.650
Yeah. Okay.

642
00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:58.330
Bye.

643
00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:02.130
Next time, try a bath. Have fun.

644
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:03.330
Thank you.

645
00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:08.810
I give you such a perfect
song, and you blow it?


646
00:49:08.890 --> 00:49:11.810
I can barely walk, much less anything else.

647
00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:16.210
Last night actually explained so much.

648
00:49:17.890 --> 00:49:21.050
- I have a theory.
- Really? Thank you, Dr. Freud.


649
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:25.250
No, seriously. You are so
obsessed with these Darwin cases...


650
00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:28.410
that you are actually becoming one.

651
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:30.330
I think she's got a point.

652
00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:37.410
No, I don't want Marcus, and
I don't want the bodyguard.


653
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:40.930
We'll be landing in 10 minutes, sir.

654
00:49:41.010 --> 00:49:42.890
Christ, man, who's flying the plane?

655
00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:45.170
I just put it on autopilot, ma'am.

656
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:48.730
Oh. Autopilot. Fantastic.

657
00:49:48.810 --> 00:49:53.610
No. Marcus just got Carla a brand-new
international driving license...


658
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:57.690
and we're going to rough
it in the wilds of America.


659
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:12.650
The controls on the dash are...
The red button there is the cruise control.


660
00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:14.570
Cruise control? What's that?

661
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:18.970
- Cruise control is... It's like autopilot.
- Oh, brilliant!


662
00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.890
Then you have the...

663
00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:33.210
You know? I think I'm really
getting the hang of this.


664
00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:39.650
- My last experience at the dentist was a nightmare.
- I get that a lot.


665
00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:41.610
There's no
reason to be worried.


666
00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:44.650
We're a team. We're a team.

667
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:48.370
- Darling, do you want another drink?
- Magic, lovey, magic.


668
00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:51.930
Magic. Yeah. I'm going to put
you on a little autopilot, lovey.


669
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:56.770
Go do your thing.

670
00:51:00.130 --> 00:51:02.050
Darling...

671
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:07.450
I've got a lovely surprise for you.

672
00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:16.290
That's very nice.

673
00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:32.530
Who's driving the van?

674
00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:34.650
It's on autopilot.

675
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:42.930
Oh, fuck.

676
00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:04.130
I don't know if
I made this clear enough...

677
00:52:04.210 --> 00:52:08.650
but we're not going anywhere
until we get a statement.


678
00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:13.290
My lawyer says because of a pending
malpractice suit, I can't make any statement.


679
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:17.090
How am I supposed to...

680
00:52:17.130 --> 00:52:19.410
I'll take a written statement
from you, Mr. Harris. Thank you.


681
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:22.610
You know what this is?
This is the medical report.


682
00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:24.850
It's got your dental impressions.

683
00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:30.490
And, well, I mean, your wearing a diaper
makes it pretty goddamn obvious what happened.


684
00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:35.010
And frankly, I don't give a shit if
you're too embarrassed to talk about it.


685
00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:39.730
What my partner means to say
is, we need a moment alone.


686
00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:43.650
Lesions on the base
of the penis! Come on!

687
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:46.410
- Come on, what?
- She was giving him head!


688
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:51.050
And you say my theories are out there!

689
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:55.210
It's bullshit! 
She gave him a blow job!

690
00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:08.690
You know these X-factor types of yours?

691
00:53:08.770 --> 00:53:12.690
They may die young, but they
sure have more fun in the process.


692
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:16.610
Okay, I admit your theory on
that case had some probability of...


693
00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:18.930
Oh, come on. It
was obvious from the get-go.

694
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:24.050
No. Yesterday, 11:33 a.m,
you said it's 99.9% probable...


695
00:53:24.130 --> 00:53:26.890
she was giving him a...
...giving him a...


696
00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:28.490
Blow job.

697
00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:31.490
You know, I still wonder if it's even
physically possible while driving...


698
00:53:31.530 --> 00:53:35.970
Oh, believe me. It's possible.
You want me to show you?


699
00:53:36.050 --> 00:53:39.250
Whoa! No, stop! It's all right. Okay,
I admit you're right. You're right.


700
00:53:39.330 --> 00:53:41.290
That's all it took?

701
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:44.050
Christ, I thought I was gonna have to
solve the energy crisis or something...


702
00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:47.170
- to ever hear you say that.
- Funny.


703
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:51.410
Oh! Hey, if we wanna make it to Tacoma
tonight we better take the interstate.


704
00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:53.330
Interstate goes over a 6,000-foot pass.

705
00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:57.490
It'll be ice this time of year. This road will
connect us to the state highway in no time.


706
00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:08.370
All right, this cannot be the right way.
The road is actually turning to dirt.


707
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:10.770
Everything's under control.

708
00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:13.250
There's a cattle grate up ahead. That
means there's ranches around here.


709
00:54:13.330 --> 00:54:15.930
Ranches?

710
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:26.850
Okay, and we don't have a spare?

711
00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:30.090
One. Car's also stuck in the grate.

712
00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:33.890
Excellent! My fucking battery's dead.

713
00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:39.850
- No signal.
- So what's the plan?


714
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:44.770
Wejust wait around here until it gets
dark and somehow our signal gets better?


715
00:54:44.810 --> 00:54:48.050
You know, I take a lot of crap
from you for being prepared.


716
00:54:48.130 --> 00:54:52.450
For thinking ahead. But you're
about to feel like a real idiot.


717
00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:56.290
This balloon...

718
00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:02.130
filament wire and helium.

719
00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:19.210
See, the wire acts like a long
antenna, and I now have a signal.


720
00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:49.730
Oh, come on. Come on. Come on.

721
00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:51.650
Oh, it's too damp.

722
00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:54.370
Fuck.

723
00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:57.730
Remember a few years back,
wasn't there, like, a couple...


724
00:55:57.810 --> 00:55:59.890
who ran out of
gas on a desolate road...

725
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:02.170
and they didn't find their bodies until...

726
00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:05.330
- That's it. There's a gas can in the car.
- Do you remember?


727
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:11.050
I got it.

728
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:22.010
- Do it. Just...
- I'm gettin' warm.


729
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:24.970
Okay.

730
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:39.090
You are one of these sorry-ass Darwin cases.

731
00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:45.370
Should we move near the car for heat?

732
00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:48.930
No, the embers from the tires could
ignite the gas tank at any moment.


733
00:56:53.530 --> 00:56:56.450
So what that, that phrase?

734
00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:59.650
"Beat me"... something?

735
00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:01.570
- Yeah.
- What is that?


736
00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:03.490
Written by a perp
who I let get away.

737
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:06.410
Only a matter of time before
he hurts someone again.


738
00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:09.290
I'm sorry about what I said before.

739
00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:11.970
- It's just our car blew up, and...
- Yeah, I know. I understand.


740
00:57:12.010 --> 00:57:14.210
You're right. I'm...

741
00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:19.090
I'm beginning to relate to these
Darwin cases a little too well.


742
00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:21.770
It happens.

743
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:24.730
I have a secret...

744
00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:27.690
something I've never told anyone before.

745
00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:33.930
Oh, shit. I'm out of tape! Damn it.

746
00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:38.410
Oh, my God.

747
00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:46.370
That's the most incredible
thing I've ever heard. I...


748
00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:49.570
I have a cell phone.

749
00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:51.570
And it has signal too.

750
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:53.050
- What?
- Yeah.


751
00:57:53.130 --> 00:57:55.410
What? Wh
-What?

752
00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:58.210
I have a cell phone.

753
00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:02.370
- You have a... Show you...
- No, please don't.


754
00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:05.570
- Please don't.
- I could ram a spork up your ass!


755
00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:23.810
Gesundheit. Or bless you. Whatever.

756
00:58:23.850 --> 00:58:27.250
Thanks.

757
00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:33.290
How do they do it?

758
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:35.210
What?

759
00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:38.130
People with normal lives.
How do they make that happen?


760
00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:43.890
You got me. Why? Is that,
like, something you hope for?


761
00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:47.330
I never hope.

762
00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:51.250
Too disappointing.

763
00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:53.610
It's amazing.

764
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:59.210
Some people bring danger on themselves
no matter what precautions they take...


765
00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:03.050
while others seem immune
to the dangers of the world.


766
00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:06.010
They do everything wrong,
take no precautions...


767
00:59:06.090 --> 00:59:08.450
cause death, damage to property.

768
00:59:08.530 --> 00:59:11.810
Yet they still live to tell about it.

769
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:21.890
Come on, dude. Let's go!

770
00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:24.090
Simon! Did you steal my pot again?

771
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:27.690
No! Relax, Mom. 
I'll be back by 11:30.

772
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:29.650
Get back here, you little shit!

773
00:59:29.730 --> 00:59:32.490
- Hi, Mrs. Simon.
- Oh, hi, Farley. How are ya?


774
00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:34.850
Let's go!

775
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:39.650
- Got the tickets?
- Getting them from Jimbo at the parking lot.


776
00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:43.170
- Fuck, dude!
- Relax, man.


777
00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:45.810
He'll be there. Whoo!

778
00:59:52.210 --> 00:59:55.050
Metallica! Whoo!

779
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:58.210
- Metallica!
- Yeah, dude. We're here, man.


780
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:02.170
Yeah! Nice parking space, dude.

781
01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:05.250
He told me he'd be here by 8:00.

782
01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:07.890
He's not fuckin' comin', man.

783
01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:15.410
Listen to that. Metallica's taking the stage,
and we're in the goddamn parking lot, man.


784
01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:27.930
They're not comin' back for two years.

785
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:30.090
I'll probably be dead or married by then.

786
01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:33.490
Hey! Hey. You wanna sell your tickets?

787
01:00:33.570 --> 01:00:35.810
- No way.
- Dude, 200 bucks.


788
01:00:35.850 --> 01:00:38.730
- Nah.
- Dude, 200 bucks...


789
01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:41.410
killer weed.

790
01:00:41.490 --> 01:00:43.970
All right, man. There's no
price on this kind of experience.


791
01:00:44.050 --> 01:00:45.770
- Dude, I'll give you my van.
- Not your ride.


792
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:47.370
- I'm serious, dude.
- Where is it?


793
01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:48.970
- It's right there.
- There.


794
01:00:51.810 --> 01:00:54.250
- No thanks.
- Idiot!


795
01:00:54.330 --> 01:00:56.250
Hey, fuck you, dude!

796
01:00:56.330 --> 01:00:58.730
That van has an excellent tape deck!

797
01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:02.050
Enjoy your leather pants,
you fuckin' butt-hole!


798
01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:04.930
That was beautiful, man.

799
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:10.090
You're so dedicated to Metallica that
you were willing to sacrifice your ride.


800
01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:12.770
Man, you lost your virginity in that van.

801
01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:14.770
No, dude. I'm still a virgin.

802
01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:17.770
- What about Lisa Cummings?
- I only got a hand job.


803
01:01:17.850 --> 01:01:20.410
Ah, fuck.

804
01:01:20.490 --> 01:01:22.610
Exactly, man. What do we got?

805
01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:25.730
Our lives are shit.

806
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:30.090
So that's why it is our birthright
at the end of the workweek...


807
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:33.770
to get messed up and go
hear fucking Metallica!


808
01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:35.850
Metallica! Metallica!

809
01:01:51.850 --> 01:01:55.210
I'm getting you into this concert, man.

810
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:59.810
The chances of a fatal
accident increase threefold...


811
01:01:59.890 --> 01:02:02.370
with a blood alcohol level of over. 20.

812
01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:07.090
- Come on up, man. It's easy.
- Combined with another drug, such as marijuana...


813
01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:09.770
the likelihood increases 10 times.

814
01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:13.890
Come on, man. You can do it.

815
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:15.970
Use the power of the music.

816
01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:22.730
Thank you.

817
01:02:26.370 --> 01:02:29.170
Dude, I'm in, man! I'm in!

818
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:31.530
Aaah! Fuck! Shit!

819
01:02:31.610 --> 01:02:33.930
- Dude, help me out!
- What?


820
01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:36.810
- Help me, man! Help me!
- Holy shit.


821
01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:39.010
Help me, man! Help me!

822
01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:41.770
- Use that Popeye strength from your mama.
- Yeah!


823
01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:43.810
Help me, man. Help me!

824
01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:51.650
Goddamn!

825
01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:53.770
Oh, shit!

826
01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:06.210
- Simon!
- I'm okay!


827
01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:08.450
The tree, like, caught me.

828
01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:13.010
Oh, yeah. I love that part. Yeah.

829
01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:14.970
All right, dude, 
I'm gonna get the rope.

830
01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:17.490
No, man. I think I'm
pretty close to the ground.


831
01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:19.530
I don't know, dude. 
It looks pretty far.

832
01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:21.890
It's bushes, man. 
I can make it.

833
01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:24.330
No, dude. Come on.

834
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:26.610
I'm gonna cut myself free...

835
01:03:26.690 --> 01:03:28.970
and then the bushes'll catch me.

836
01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:31.170
When you fall just be
loose, like stage diving.


837
01:03:31.210 --> 01:03:34.450
- Right.
- And try not to fall on your head.


838
01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:38.250
Hey. Can you shine that light
down again? I want to light a bone.


839
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:47.490
Dude, I'm tokin' simultaneously.

840
01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:49.730
Yeah, man.

841
01:03:51.850 --> 01:03:54.250
- Ah!
- Oh, shit.


842
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:57.730
Simon!

843
01:03:57.770 --> 01:04:00.290
Fuck, man! You trying to kill me?

844
01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:02.570
Sorry, dude. What's the situation?

845
01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:07.370
I think it's pretty fucked up, man!

846
01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:10.370
- These are, like, sticker bushes!
- Damn.


847
01:04:10.450 --> 01:04:12.810
- Didn't fall on my head.
- Right on.


848
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:23.930
I got an idea.

849
01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:27.770
I'm gonna tie the rope to the bumper of the
van. I'm gonna throw it over to you, all right?


850
01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:29.890
Then I'll just ease you up, all right?

851
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:32.930
The other risk factor with
simultaneous drug use...


852
01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:36.450
- is seriously impairedjudgment.
- Sounds like a plan.


853
01:04:42.810 --> 01:04:45.610
- More, dude.
- You got it?


854
01:04:45.690 --> 01:04:48.130
Yeah. Yeah, I got it! I got it!

855
01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:55.370
Ah, fuck.

856
01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:57.650
Oh, shit. Aah.

857
01:05:10.370 --> 01:05:12.450
Dude!

858
01:05:20.330 --> 01:05:23.130
Dude.

859
01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:25.850
Listen. We stopped the music.

860
01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:27.810
The boy in the van survived.

861
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.970
His friend was not so lucky.

862
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:38.410
Gotta make a phone call.

863
01:05:55.210 --> 01:05:57.250
Fuck.

864
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:12.410
This is purely for investigative purposes.

865
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:21.210
What the hell are you doing?

866
01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:27.010
Research.

867
01:06:27.090 --> 01:06:29.930
Ah. Well, good to see you're holdin' up.

868
01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:35.610
- Neither of them is a second child.
- So?


869
01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:39.450
So that was the one solid
trait I had linking the cases.


870
01:06:39.530 --> 01:06:43.410
Look, with the amount of money you're
saving Simmons and the company...


871
01:06:43.450 --> 01:06:46.330
believe me, you're gonna get the job.

872
01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:51.130
A new job... doesn't matter anymore.

873
01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:54.330
If I'm gonna find a way
to prevent these deaths...


874
01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:57.490
I have to know why they do it.

875
01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:06.090
I'll tell you why.

876
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:11.330
Do you know that companies intentionally
build in mistakes to monthly bills...


877
01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:15.210
hoping you won't notice, just
so they can save a few pennies?


878
01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:18.130
And insurance firms,
like the one I work for...


879
01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:21.210
we have a... policy...

880
01:07:21.290 --> 01:07:25.210
of rejecting every claim right off the bat.

881
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:30.250
And if you call to dispute that claim...

882
01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:33.370
you get put on hold.

883
01:07:33.450 --> 01:07:38.650
And then you get sent through an
endless maze of voice mail menus...


884
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:41.610
until you just give up.

885
01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:45.410
All these minor insults,
they build up over the years.


886
01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:50.290
Finally, people just...
People just lose their shit.


887
01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:55.930
And you feel...

888
01:07:55.970 --> 01:08:00.210
powerless and faceless, and...

889
01:08:01.890 --> 01:08:06.330
and you end up strapping a JATO
rocket to the back of your Chevy.


890
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:11.490
Let's get you some coffee.

891
01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:21.370
Oh, uh, coffee, regular.

892
01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:24.090
"You can't beat me."

893
01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:27.290
So illiterate for a lit major.

894
01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:31.730
Well, a lit major.
Maybe it's a quote.


895
01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:33.690
Nah, not a quote.

896
01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:39.090
Did you hear that one about the
guys ice fishing using dynamite?


897
01:08:39.130 --> 01:08:41.210
- Oh, yeah, yeah, with the dog.
- Exactly. Yeah.


898
01:08:41.290 --> 01:08:45.330
What about the guy who takes a
rocket and bolts it onto the car?


899
01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:47.290
- Yeah. He did a thousand miles an hour.
- I heard 2,000.


900
01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:49.530
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- I swear.


901
01:08:49.570 --> 01:08:52.130
Harvey Wedstone.

902
01:08:52.210 --> 01:08:54.050
What?

903
01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.050
He had a name, and it
was Harvey Wedstone.


904
01:08:56.130 --> 01:08:59.010
And he had something you'll never have...

905
01:08:59.090 --> 01:09:01.010
- an imagination.
- Un-Unstable.


906
01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.730
How about I don't give a shit?

907
01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:07.930
You will.

908
01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:09.970
No!

909
01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:34.330
Can you see me?

910
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:37.690
Yeah.

911
01:09:37.730 --> 01:09:39.610
Where are we?

912
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:41.530
Oh, we're in my room.

913
01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:43.490
Where's the numb-nuts?

914
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:46.650
- I locked him in the bathroom.
- Please let me out.


915
01:09:48.090 --> 01:09:51.610
Oh, my God. Are you still high?

916
01:09:51.690 --> 01:09:53.930
'Cause this stuff is kinda strong.

917
01:09:54.010 --> 01:09:56.810
I don't know.
I've never been high before.


918
01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:59.130
It's kinda cool.

919
01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:04.650
You know, I... saw the boy's face.

920
01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:07.770
And it was like
I was one of them.

921
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:11.530
- I'm starting to worry about you, Burrows.
- Why?


922
01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:16.450
You gotta learn
to detach from these people.


923
01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:19.890
Just let them go.

924
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:22.450
- Well, I can't.
- Oh. Be careful there.


925
01:10:22.530 --> 01:10:24.890
- I'm not like you.
- What do you mean?


926
01:10:24.930 --> 01:10:26.810
Look at yourself, Siri.

927
01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:29.290
The body of that boy in the morgue...

928
01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:33.050
You acted like he was
just some piece of meat.

929
01:10:33.130 --> 01:10:38.370
Well, you know...
I was doing my job. That's my job.


930
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:42.850
You've been doing this for four
weeks and look what it's done to you.


931
01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:47.850
You've gone from...
...from robot to rehab candidate.


932
01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:51.450
Well, I've been doing it for 10 years.

933
01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:55.210
And I've been doing it alone.

934
01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:59.130
- Siri, I'm sorry.
- I'm just not gonna sit here like you...


935
01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:02.010
and photographically
remember every single death.


936
01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.130
I remember good things too.

937
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:09.450
On December 3, 10:45 a.m...

938
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:13.250
your arm brushed against my shoulder...

939
01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:15.730
as we ate at the restaurant.

940
01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:19.610
On December 13, after dinner...

941
01:11:19.690 --> 01:11:24.090
your hand rested on mine for a moment...

942
01:11:24.170 --> 01:11:26.330
as you got in the car.

943
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:32.690
Yesterday, at 5:45 p.m...

944
01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:57.090
This is gold, baby.

945
01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:01.290
Ah, shit.

946
01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:13.570
Oh, it's you. How'd you get out?

947
01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:16.330
- She had to take a shower.
- Oh.


948
01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:19.210
I think she might be in
the restaurant actually.


949
01:12:25.450 --> 01:12:27.290
Damn, she's...

950
01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:31.130
- Okay, okay.
- Nice to meet you. Thank you for the coffee.


951
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:34.010
- Hey. How's it goin'?
- Good. Good.


952
01:12:34.090 --> 01:12:37.850
- What's going on?
- What? Do...


953
01:12:37.890 --> 01:12:41.250
Come on, Burrows.

954
01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:44.410
Last night was... stress relief.

955
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:46.450
You know, we were both on edge.

956
01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:48.890
A little reefer involved.

957
01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:51.370
It was more than just stress relief.

958
01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:54.890
Um, you know what? 
Don't you have, like...

959
01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:57.890
less than five days to
finish your project or else...


960
01:12:57.970 --> 01:13:01.210
How did you put it?
"My life will be over."

961
01:13:01.290 --> 01:13:03.130
Sorry.

962
01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:08.370
You know, we're not the
kind of people who can...


963
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:12.370
you know, do that
or have that or whatever.

964
01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:19.490
You think I don't know people.

965
01:13:19.570 --> 01:13:22.370
You're wrong.

966
01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:24.930
That was my specialty...

967
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:30.410
Analyzing a personality, anticipating
what their ultimate mistake's gonna be.


968
01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:34.170
Your father left you between
the ages of four and five.


969
01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:37.530
Just old enough to have a
memory of him, but it's fuzzy.


970
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:42.690
Fuzzy enough that you can project
him onto every man you encounter.


971
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:46.490
Fear of rejection causes you to work long
hours, have a job where you move constantly.


972
01:13:46.570 --> 01:13:48.410
It keeps attachments to a minimum.

973
01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:51.530
Unless it's a one-night stand.

974
01:13:51.610 --> 01:13:54.330
You like those 'cause you
can control the situation.


975
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:58.010
That way you can always be
the one who does the leaving.


976
01:13:58.050 --> 01:14:01.370
Tell me, genius.

977
01:14:01.410 --> 01:14:04.370
What is my ultimate mistake gonna be?

978
01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:08.970
You'll do this pattern too long...

979
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:14.370
To the point where you can't
do anything else but be alone.


980
01:14:15.610 --> 01:14:18.690
Ow. Ow! I cut myself.

981
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:24.610
You know what? I know what
your problem is, Burrows.


982
01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:27.330
You're faint of heart.

983
01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:30.090
Find yourself another partner, because I quit.

984
01:14:32.490 --> 01:14:34.890
You okay, man?

985
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:37.970
Uh, I guess I am.

986
01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:40.730
You've got to snap
out of it, man. Seriously.

987
01:14:40.770 --> 01:14:42.970
You guys didn't get along anyway.

988
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:47.290
- I guess.
- I'm Mike Sugerman with Bay News Channel 1.


989
01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:50.690
San Francisco Police say the North
Beach killer may have struck again.


990
01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:54.330
The body of a young 25-to-35-year-old
woman was found here at...


991
01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:56.810
Son of a bitch!

992
01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:58.650
There were no other witnesses.

993
01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:06.290
Couple at the restaurant, they were...
...they were reading books.


994
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:09.890
You don't see that much anymore.

995
01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:16.010
When I arrested the perp, I
was comin'out of a bookstore.


996
01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:17.850
- You travel with your tapes?
- Yeah.


997
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:19.770
- All of them?
- Yeah.


998
01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:24.290
Fast-forward.
Fast-forward.


999
01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:27.650
Slow it down.

1000
01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:32.810
Freeze the frame. Zoom in.

1001
01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:38.930
- "Howl."
- What's "Howl"?


1002
01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:41.250
A famous book by
one of the beat poets.

1003
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:43.970
Beat poets.

1004
01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:47.410
"You can't beat me."

1005
01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:50.330
The plans have changed.
We're going to San Francisco.


1006
01:15:56.170 --> 01:16:00.210
Entering a crime scene or
tampering with evidence is a felony.


1007
01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:02.490
I don't recommend it.

1008
01:16:10.730 --> 01:16:12.570
Nothing's changed.

1009
01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:16.930
I'm here 'cause numb-nuts called me and
said you were about to do something stupid.


1010
01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:19.290
- Sorry.
- Manipulator. Interferer.


1011
01:16:19.370 --> 01:16:21.690
Why don't you just sell out
and move to Hollywood right now?


1012
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:25.130
Listen, this is not your responsibility.

1013
01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:27.570
- Just call the police.
- They won't even let me in the station.


1014
01:16:27.610 --> 01:16:30.050
And this woman, she's
dead 'cause I let him go.


1015
01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:34.570
- You can't even go in there.
- I'll need another set of eyes.


1016
01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:39.330
Footprints.
Do you see any?


1017
01:16:39.410 --> 01:16:42.370
Um, yeah, and they're huge.

1018
01:16:42.450 --> 01:16:44.730
Good. Do you see any writing anywhere?

1019
01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:47.290
Just the menu.

1020
01:16:47.370 --> 01:16:49.610
Well, what does it say?

1021
01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:56.890
It's so obvious.

1022
01:16:56.930 --> 01:17:01.410
The book by Ferlinghetti.
Coney Island of the Mind.


1023
01:17:06.610 --> 01:17:09.450
Hey. Look what I found.

1024
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:11.370
That's great.

1025
01:17:11.450 --> 01:17:14.330
But he was referring to
this book by Ferlinghetti...


1026
01:17:14.410 --> 01:17:16.250
not some tourist guide.

1027
01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:19.650
Well, why don't we just go talk
to this Ferlinghetti guy directly?


1028
01:17:19.730 --> 01:17:21.890
- That's a great idea.
- Thank you.


1029
01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:24.490
You don't just go talk
to Lawrence Ferlinghetti.


1030
01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:29.370
Well, it says right here
that he owns this bookstore.


1031
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:31.530
Um, is this guy here by any chance?

1032
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:33.770
No.

1033
01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:36.450
I think he's having
a drink over at Tosca.

1034
01:17:39.850 --> 01:17:42.170
- Buy me this?
- Fuck off.


1035
01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:45.170
Sir, have you ever seen this man?

1036
01:17:45.210 --> 01:17:47.690
Oh, yeah. That guy.

1037
01:17:47.770 --> 01:17:51.770
- He was a real wannabe beat.
- What do you mean?


1038
01:17:51.810 --> 01:17:53.690
Well, he filled endless
notebooks with endless poems...


1039
01:17:53.730 --> 01:17:55.770
and nobody would publish
them, including myself.


1040
01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:57.930
You can imagine how the poor guy felt.

1041
01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:59.850
I don't think this man feels anything.

1042
01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:04.650
Well, as the man says, "Only
the dead are disconnected."


1043
01:18:04.730 --> 01:18:08.010
I remember him. 
He was a real asshole.

1044
01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:12.290
Do-Do you have, uh... Any
idea where we could find him?


1045
01:18:12.370 --> 01:18:14.210
I haven't seen him in years.

1046
01:18:14.290 --> 01:18:17.530
I do remember that he
was absolutely obsessed...


1047
01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:19.530
with Brautigan's Trout Fishing in America.

1048
01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:21.490
Fishing for clues. Of course.

1049
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:25.010
When Brautigan was alive, he used
to camp outside Brautigan's office.


1050
01:18:25.090 --> 01:18:26.970
It was really creepy.

1051
01:18:27.010 --> 01:18:32.330
Are you talking about that office above
the bar just right across from City Lights?


1052
01:18:32.410 --> 01:18:34.570
Vesuvio's. That was the place.

1053
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:37.770
That's a great book, by the way.

1054
01:18:40.170 --> 01:18:42.730
Okay, now it really is
time to call the cops.

1055
01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:45.610
It's not like TV. You can't
break in without a warrant.


1056
01:18:45.690 --> 01:18:48.770
For the conviction to stick, we need
evidence linking him to the murder.


1057
01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:51.450
Yeah, but you just
said we can't break in.

1058
01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:53.850
Remember those guys at the rock
concert? Their idea with the rope?


1059
01:18:53.890 --> 01:18:56.290
- Do you remember what happened to them?
- They were on drugs.


1060
01:18:56.370 --> 01:18:58.650
Precisely my point.

1061
01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:01.530
Listen, it'd be a good idea to have
some way to record the evidence.


1062
01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:12.090
Siri, when I see the evidence,
I'll give you a thumbs-up.


1063
01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:15.010
- Okay. Then I call 911.
- Shh.


1064
01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:18.090
Yeah.

1065
01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:34.130
Bingo.

1066
01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:43.170
What the hell are you doing?
How did you get down here?


1067
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:45.370
Oh, I tied on to
the other end of the rope.

1068
01:19:45.450 --> 01:19:47.610
That is too much weight.

1069
01:19:52.730 --> 01:19:54.970
Okay, maybe you're right.

1070
01:19:56.010 --> 01:19:58.850
Damn it! Damn right I'm right.

1071
01:19:58.890 --> 01:20:01.170
Are you okay? What should I do?

1072
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:03.250
The rope is slipping. Go up
on the roof and secure it.


1073
01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:05.810
Okay.

1074
01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:13.570
No. No. Siri! Don't
go up on the roof!

1075
01:20:16.290 --> 01:20:18.210
Shit!

1076
01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:20.170
I'm only gonna tell you this once.

1077
01:20:20.250 --> 01:20:22.130
Call 911 now.

1078
01:20:27.010 --> 01:20:29.490
Salutations.

1079
01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:34.330
No!

1080
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:36.290
- You talked to Ferlinghetti.
- You can't!


1081
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:38.850
- Don't give 'em more evidence!
- I don't think I am.


1082
01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:42.810
You see, I happen to remember
your peculiar frailty.


1083
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:45.370
- No! Don't!
- Ow! Fucker!


1084
01:20:45.410 --> 01:20:48.570
Oh, the world is a beautiful
place to be born into...


1085
01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:52.650
if you don't much mind a few
dead minds in the higher places...


1086
01:20:52.730 --> 01:20:55.770
or a bomb or two now and
then in your upturned faces.


1087
01:20:57.330 --> 01:20:59.890
Burrows.

1088
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:07.650
- Catch.
- Oh, shit!


1089
01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:14.170
Oh, shit!

1090
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:18.730
Are you... Numb-nuts.

1091
01:21:21.930 --> 01:21:24.410
You could've just let me
fall. Why did you hold on?


1092
01:21:26.050 --> 01:21:27.930
Instinct.

1093
01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:31.330
I didn't wanna be saved, you fucking cretin.

1094
01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:33.650
Okay.

1095
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:37.690
We shall go no more a-roving.

1096
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:46.050
Is he gonna be all right?

1097
01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:48.610
He's got a concussion. I'm gonna
take him over to S.F. General.


1098
01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:50.530
Well, can we ride with him at least?

1099
01:21:50.610 --> 01:21:52.850
No, sorry. We got
no room in the ambulance.

1100
01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:55.930
In fact, buddy, you're gonna have to
leave your camera here with your friends.


1101
01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:57.930
Well, then I'm not going.

1102
01:21:58.010 --> 01:22:00.250
Believe me. You are never
gonna win that argument.


1103
01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:02.330
Come on. Let him keep the camera.

1104
01:22:02.370 --> 01:22:05.050
I mean, what's the harm?

1105
01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:09.170
- Insurance, for one.
- Insurance? Oh. Fuck the insurance.


1106
01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:11.930
I didn't see anything.

1107
01:22:15.130 --> 01:22:17.010
All right.

1108
01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:24.810
Well, you got thejob if you want it.

1109
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:28.410
But I never found any common
trait for the X-Factor.


1110
01:22:28.450 --> 01:22:33.530
Tomorrow there's gonna be another 10,000
accidents, another thousand murders...


1111
01:22:33.570 --> 01:22:36.730
A hundred thousand coronaries.

1112
01:22:37.730 --> 01:22:39.810
Burrows.

1113
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:43.450
It is not your job
to save the entire world.

1114
01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:46.130
That's impossible.

1115
01:22:51.250 --> 01:22:55.290
You're right. Maybe the world's
not such a dangerous place.


1116
01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:01.170
Oh, damn. I missed it.

1117
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:04.970
- So what are you makin'?...
- Oh, it's a documentary.


1118
01:23:05.050 --> 01:23:09.130
- Yeah? On what?
- Uh, paramedics.


1119
01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:13.010
- No way. Really?
- Just keep going about your job as if I'm not here.


1120
01:23:13.090 --> 01:23:15.930
Just pretend I'm invisible.

1121
01:23:15.970 --> 01:23:17.850
Cool, man.

1122
01:23:22.610 --> 01:23:25.570
You need anything? You all right? You cool?

1123
01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:27.650
No, dude. I'm just happy to be here.

1124
01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:31.850
- I feel sorry for you. You don't look so hot.
- Can I ask one question?


1125
01:23:31.930 --> 01:23:33.850
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Hey, you know.


1126
01:23:33.930 --> 01:23:36.410
Sex, drugs and rock and roll, dude.

1127
01:23:36.450 --> 01:23:39.730
You should just focus on the sex and rock
and roll and forget about the drugs, huh?


1128
01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:41.690
Actually, you could probably
forget about the sex too.


1129
01:23:44.530 --> 01:23:46.370
Stick to rock and roll, dude.

1130
01:23:51.690 --> 01:23:54.850
Appreciate it.

1131
01:23:54.930 --> 01:23:58.530
And this next song goes out...

1132
01:23:58.610 --> 01:24:01.250
to a dearly departed friend, Simon.

1133
01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:45.210
I fucking did something!

1134
01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:50.650
You minimum-wage asshole!

1135
01:24:58.730 --> 01:25:00.570
Your father's lost his mind again.

1136
01:25:06.530 --> 01:25:10.810
Too much Satan for one hand.

1137
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:16.530
Damn!

1138
01:25:18.690 --> 01:25:22.130
Oh, fuck.

1139
01:25:30.370 --> 01:25:32.890
I think I'm really getting
the hang of this now.


1140
01:25:36.330 --> 01:25:38.650
We shall go no more a-roving.

1141
01:25:40.650 --> 01:25:43.330
Wait...

1142
01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:45.530
Get away from there!

1143
01:25:45.610 --> 01:25:47.490
No, Max!

1144
01:25:59.490 --> 01:26:01.690
It's not all doughnuts and broads.

1145
01:26:03.010 --> 01:26:05.250
Making me...
Ah! God!


1146
01:26:05.330 --> 01:26:07.650
Are you okay?

1147
01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:12.730
Okay, maybe you're right.

1148
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:17.810
Pathetic!

1149
01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:39.450
"Only the dead are disconnected."

1150
01:29:53.410 --> 01:29:56.090
Michael? Hello? 
Is this Michael?

1151
01:29:56.130 --> 01:29:59.810
Should I dress up? Were you thinking
about going to someplace that's upscale?


1152
01:29:59.890 --> 01:30:02.130
Because I'll have to go home
and change into something else...


1153
01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:04.570
because all I have is my work clothes,
and I don't wanna go someplace...


1154
01:30:07.530 --> 01:30:10.730
Hello? Hello?

1155
01:30:14.290 --> 01:30:16.530
Hello?
