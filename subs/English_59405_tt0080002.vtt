00:13:51.005 --> 00:13:52.048
Please!

153
00:13:53.091 --> 00:13:55.468
It's too late to plead. You cheated.

154
00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:58.554
I should give you a lesson
you'll never forget.


155
00:13:59.222 --> 00:14:00.723
Some broken bones!

156
00:14:00.848 --> 00:14:01.974
- Oh, no!
- Please, no!


157
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.893
- Don't!
- No, please!


158
00:14:05.186 --> 00:14:07.730
Hey, you're being too harsh.

159
00:14:07.855 --> 00:14:09.899
Do me a favor
and just let them go.

160
00:14:10.024 --> 00:14:13.194
They're sorry for what they did.
Can't you see?


161
00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:15.071
- Seeing my brother?
- Yeah.


162
00:14:15.196 --> 00:14:17.615
Dick wei as wong ching-ho
wei pai as wong kei-ying


163
00:14:21.953 --> 00:14:23.037
- _ go!
- Oh, yes...


164
00:14:27.583 --> 00:14:31.879
Idiots, idiots! You're all such idiots.
You're hopeless!


165
00:14:39.637 --> 00:14:42.306
We'll soon see. He'll pay!

166
00:14:43.224 --> 00:14:46.727
Brother li, you have my word
that I'll help you in this.


167
00:14:47.645 --> 00:14:48.688
Hmm.

168
00:14:51.732 --> 00:14:55.820
I've a few more helpers in mind.
First on the list is wang yin-iin.


169
00:14:57.613 --> 00:14:59.490
Also, I'd like to get su hei-hu.

170
00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:03.786
Wang yin-iin and su hei-hu
are both from well-known clans.


171
00:15:03.911 --> 00:15:07.290
Do you think they'll volunteer themselves
for this? Bear that in mind.


172
00:15:07.415 --> 00:15:09.667
What do you want wang yin-iin
and su hei-hu for?


173
00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:16.382
I know where they are.
I'll go get them.


174
00:15:16.507 --> 00:15:19.218
I'll bring them back,
one way or the other.


175
00:15:22.138 --> 00:15:23.347
(SIGHING)

176
00:15:24.724 --> 00:15:26.976
He's very temperamental.
That's his nature.


177
00:15:27.727 --> 00:15:30.104
That's why I haven't told him
about Mr. Chai yet.


178
00:15:30.229 --> 00:15:33.191
Tell me, is it true that
because of his temper,


179
00:15:33.316 --> 00:15:35.943
his grandfather refused
to teach him kung fu?


180
00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:40.114
That's right. He taught himself kung fu.
He's good, too.


181
00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:44.327
He had this blind ambition
that one day he's gonna beat us.


182
00:15:48.414 --> 00:15:50.791
Sun chien as wang yin-lin

183
00:15:56.672 --> 00:15:59.509
Heh! Seven sevens is 49.

184
00:15:59.634 --> 00:16:02.178
27 are high, 22 short.

185
00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:05.139
It's the seven star lama style.

186
00:16:05.598 --> 00:16:08.309
You must be wang yin-iin.
Am I right?


187
00:16:09.393 --> 00:16:12.563
- Who are you?
- Tan ming.


188
00:16:12.688 --> 00:16:14.857
- I know of you.
- You do?


189
00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:18.611
That's good.

190
00:16:18.736 --> 00:16:22.198
My brother, li Jen-chiao,
and two of his very good friends,


191
00:16:22.323 --> 00:16:23.991
they want to see you. Hmm?

192
00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:28.955
Hey, you coming down?

193
00:16:29.872 --> 00:16:30.915
Huh?

194
00:16:33.167 --> 00:16:34.669
Come on.

195
00:16:34.794 --> 00:16:36.671
You... you wanna fight?

196
00:16:45.721 --> 00:16:46.889
Huh.

197
00:17:00.611 --> 00:17:02.572
Hey, better we fight down here.

198
00:17:08.953 --> 00:17:10.538
Tan ming, stop it!

199
00:17:10.663 --> 00:17:12.373
If I stop, I'll be killed.

200
00:17:15.501 --> 00:17:17.920
- Brother wang, please stop!
- He can't stop, either.


201
00:17:24.176 --> 00:17:26.554
Brother wang, please excuse him.

202
00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:28.431
I'm li Jen-chiao.

203
00:17:28.556 --> 00:17:32.768
Hmm! Your reputation in kung fu
is well known.


204
00:17:32.893 --> 00:17:36.564
You need not bring them.
Are you afraid you're going to lose?


205
00:17:36.689 --> 00:17:39.025
Is that why you have
the wang masters on standby?


206
00:17:41.986 --> 00:17:46.032
You're mistaken. Brother li came here
to ask for your help. He meant no harm.


207
00:17:46.657 --> 00:17:50.202
Hmm!
Is this the kind of help he needs?


208
00:17:50.328 --> 00:17:52.079
Very funny. Please go, now.

209
00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:53.539
Huh?

210
00:17:53.664 --> 00:17:56.125
Tan ming, go and apologize
to brother wang.


211
00:17:56.584 --> 00:17:58.461
I've no time for trifles. I'm going.

212
00:18:01.464 --> 00:18:05.217
Lu feng as su hei-hu

213
00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:46.550
(CHATTING)

214
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.601
- Let's get on with the job.
- Come on.


215
00:18:57.728 --> 00:18:58.771
Mipu pier

216
00:19:00.564 --> 00:19:01.899
- pass it over here.
- Come on.


217
00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:06.278
- Hey.
- Who are you? What do you want?


218
00:19:08.781 --> 00:19:09.907
Who is this guy, huh?

219
00:19:10.032 --> 00:19:11.575
(MUTTERING)

220
00:19:11.701 --> 00:19:15.454
Well... I am here to see your boss.

221
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:19.083
I was told he's a very reasonable man.

222
00:19:19.667 --> 00:19:22.545
But I didn't expect this.
Is this your welcome?


223
00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:30.302
Whoa!

224
00:19:32.805 --> 00:19:33.848
- Master!
- Hmm?


225
00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:37.184
Master, there's a man giving us trouble.
He's outside.


226
00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.104
No one dares cause trouble in my place.

227
00:19:40.229 --> 00:19:42.440
You must have provoked him
into fighting you.


228
00:19:42.565 --> 00:19:44.275
I'll sort it out.

229
00:19:45.568 --> 00:19:47.069
(FIGHTING AND SHOUTING)

230
00:19:47.194 --> 00:19:48.237
Over there!

231
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.575
Stop!

232
00:19:58.622 --> 00:20:00.499
Hmm. Su hei-hu?

233
00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:04.044
- Who are you?
- Tan ming.


234
00:20:04.587 --> 00:20:06.964
You don't seem friendly.
What do you want?


235
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.842
That what you think?
I wanna fight you!


236
00:20:11.886 --> 00:20:14.597
You're not good enough to fight me.
You're weak!


237
00:20:25.775 --> 00:20:27.151
Hah!

238
00:20:47.338 --> 00:20:48.380
Li Jen-chiao!

239
00:20:52.718 --> 00:20:55.471
Li Jen-chiao!
I've got something here for you!


240
00:21:15.699 --> 00:21:17.535
Ha! I should have known.

241
00:21:20.037 --> 00:21:21.121
You're all unreasonable.

242
00:21:23.624 --> 00:21:24.708
(LAUGHING)

243
00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:34.343
Hey, enough for now.

244
00:21:34.468 --> 00:21:38.180
Brother li, you overestimated su hei-hu.
He's not very good.


245
00:21:40.975 --> 00:21:42.101
You're su hei-hu?

246
00:21:43.269 --> 00:21:46.730
Huh. You're so tricky.
I should have drowned you!


247
00:21:46.856 --> 00:21:50.693
Ha! You should have.
And you wouldn't have got hit then.


248
00:21:50.818 --> 00:21:51.902
Bastard!

249
00:21:56.699 --> 00:21:58.742
Brother su, I'm sorry.

250
00:21:59.368 --> 00:22:01.287
It's my fault. It really is.

251
00:22:02.121 --> 00:22:03.789
What's all this about?

252
00:22:07.668 --> 00:22:09.879
Hey, this man's a troublemaker.

253
00:22:10.004 --> 00:22:12.423
Wang lin-yin, wang chi-ying,
give me a hand.


254
00:22:12.548 --> 00:22:15.509
- Let's get rid of him.
- I think you're due for some punishment.


255
00:22:19.346 --> 00:22:20.389
Ooh!

256
00:22:21.056 --> 00:22:22.099
(LAUGHING)

257
00:22:24.268 --> 00:22:28.272
Hey, please excuse our little brother.
I've already taught him a lesson.


258
00:22:28.397 --> 00:22:31.150
- Please forgive him.
- (LAUGHING)


259
00:22:31.275 --> 00:22:35.779
It's alright. His tang boxing's not bad.
He nearly beat me.


260
00:22:35.905 --> 00:22:37.823
Luckily, I got him in water.

261
00:22:37.948 --> 00:22:38.991
(LAUGHING)

262
00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:51.378
Chu hung-ying,
an anti-qing activist.


263
00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:56.550
He's been branded as a wanted man
by the government, but he's a hero.


264
00:22:57.426 --> 00:23:01.555
I want to thank you for your kindness.
I shall remember.


265
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:04.475
All of us here are from Shaolin.

266
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.438
Maybe from different clans, but I'm sure
everyone will agree to join in this.


267
00:23:10.272 --> 00:23:13.484
- You know, we need your assistance.
- I understand.


268
00:23:13.943 --> 00:23:16.070
Before I heard this, 
I couldn't care.

269
00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:20.324
But now, now that I know about it,
I must help you. It's my duty.


270
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.242
He's right.

271
00:23:22.826 --> 00:23:24.662
We mustn't let anyone know he's here.

272
00:23:25.287 --> 00:23:28.332
They have a search warrant for him.
We must be careful.


273
00:23:28.874 --> 00:23:32.002
- Right. We'll be careful.
- You're my biggest worry.


274
00:23:36.173 --> 00:23:39.093
We'll meet here every day
and exchange views.


275
00:23:39.927 --> 00:23:42.888
Because it's not safe
for us to meet in public.


276
00:23:43.013 --> 00:23:44.431
Yeah.

277
00:23:46.809 --> 00:23:47.977
Pawnbrokers

278
00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:06.662
Ahh, come in, come in.

279
00:24:11.709 --> 00:24:14.712
Why is su hei-hu visiting
at such an hour?


280
00:24:23.262 --> 00:24:24.346
Come on in.

281
00:24:32.312 --> 00:24:34.356
- (LAUGHTER)
- Now, enjoy yourselves.


282
00:24:35.607 --> 00:24:37.526
Oh! Welcome.

283
00:24:37.651 --> 00:24:38.944
Welcome, come.

284
00:24:40.654 --> 00:24:43.407
Calm down. She'll be here soon.
Just be patient.


285
00:24:43.532 --> 00:24:47.119
- (MAN) Better be true this time, anyway.
- Have some?


286
00:24:50.039 --> 00:24:51.665
- Your health.
- (MAN) Good health!


287
00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.668
- Cheers.
- Hsiao hung, listen.


288
00:24:54.793 --> 00:24:58.047
You go and entertain Mr. Liang
and make him happy.


289
00:24:58.672 --> 00:25:01.467
Your job is to make him drink,
forget his work.


290
00:25:01.592 --> 00:25:03.177
- (LAUGHTER)
- (MAN) That's right, yes!


291
00:25:03.302 --> 00:25:05.304
- (MAN) Bottoms up.
- A drink? Oh!


292
00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.934
Mr. Liang is not in a good mood.
You'd better leave.


293
00:25:11.602 --> 00:25:12.853
Yes.

294
00:25:20.069 --> 00:25:24.323
You know I have orders to capture
chai min-yi within a month.


295
00:25:25.532 --> 00:25:27.659
Time's running short
and I still couldn't find him.


296
00:25:27.785 --> 00:25:32.039
- You'll find him.
- Mm. You think it's that easy, huh?


297
00:25:32.706 --> 00:25:36.001
- Up till now, no sign of him.
- Oh! Ha-ha!


298
00:25:37.377 --> 00:25:40.464
Chiao tung-San,
I remember chasing him once.


299
00:25:40.589 --> 00:25:43.801
It was somewhere near your shop.
Then he vanished.


300
00:25:43.926 --> 00:25:46.053
Hmm. I hope you're not putting him up.

301
00:25:46.178 --> 00:25:48.180
Ah! Oh, no, no, no. No, no.

302
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:51.058
Don't say things like that.
I'll be beheaded!


303
00:25:51.183 --> 00:25:52.351
(LAUGHING)

If you wait and hold back,
I'll punch you once.

If you don't,
you'll have some broken bones.

If you get close and punch me, I'll knock
my head against the stairs till I die.

- (MAN) Soldiers are coming!
- (SOLDIER) What's going on? Stop!


614
00:52:40.749 --> 00:52:43.585
Fighting? In broad daylight?
You all step aside.


615
00:52:44.044 --> 00:52:46.839
- No one leaves till I say so.
- Come on!


616
00:52:47.423 --> 00:52:49.675
Damn it! Soldiers are here.
Protect Mr. Chai!


617
00:52:57.224 --> 00:52:58.517
Search the place!

(GRUNTING AND FIGHTING BELOW)

619
00:53:08.193 --> 00:53:09.236
Huh?

620
00:53:09.361 --> 00:53:10.612
- _ go!
- Right!


621
00:53:25.794 --> 00:53:27.421
(YELLING)

622
00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:31.341
- Go on!
- Come on.


623
00:53:37.848 --> 00:53:41.268
Tieh chiao-San, you've not lived up
to your reputation.


624
00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:46.315
- You surprise me, working for them.
- You're insulting me.


625
00:53:47.316 --> 00:53:49.860
Didn't you get a reward
for telling 'em we're here?


626
00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.288
Let's go.

627
00:54:03.081 --> 00:54:04.416
Come on.

628
00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:18.555
We only came here
to challenge tan ming.


629
00:54:19.556 --> 00:54:21.934
We don't know why the guards are here.

(STUTTERING)

631
00:54:31.193 --> 00:54:33.487
Mr. Chiao, tell us. Was it you?

632
00:54:33.612 --> 00:54:35.489
- (WHIMPERING)
- No!


633
00:54:35.614 --> 00:54:39.618
Huh! You arranged all this.
We're not so stupid as to let you use us!


634
00:54:40.619 --> 00:54:44.122
Please listen. This is quite complicated,
so let me explain.


635
00:54:44.248 --> 00:54:47.918
- Li Jen-chiao has a wanted man.
- So what?


636
00:54:48.627 --> 00:54:53.799
I know it's all my fault. Forgive me,
but, you see, he is my enemy.


637
00:54:53.924 --> 00:54:58.971
He has burned my house,
destroyed my land, took everything I had.


638
00:54:59.096 --> 00:55:02.307
And then he raped and he killed my wife.
Now do you understand?


639
00:55:04.726 --> 00:55:08.856
The man is protected by li.
Until now, the court can't find him.


640
00:55:10.357 --> 00:55:12.568
I know you all
have a sense of justice.

641
00:55:12.693 --> 00:55:15.863
You all must help me,
or else I've got no one else to turn to.


642
00:55:17.614 --> 00:55:20.367
Huh! If that's true,
we'll help to get him!


643
00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:24.329
I'll pay you all for helping me.

644
00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:27.916
- We don't need money!
- Oh, I... I didn't mean it that way.


645
00:55:28.041 --> 00:55:30.502
I offered it as an act of gratitude
to all of you.


646
00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:33.130
Alright. We'll take care of it.

647
00:55:33.255 --> 00:55:34.923
- Come on.
- Thank you, thank you!


648
00:55:50.939 --> 00:55:52.399
It's getting critical.

649
00:55:53.942 --> 00:55:56.778
Su hei-hu, you go and make
all necessary arrangements.


650
00:55:56.904 --> 00:55:57.946
Right.

651
00:56:01.283 --> 00:56:02.784
Chai, come on.

652
00:56:17.382 --> 00:56:21.929
Listen, I've gotta leave now.
I'll sort this out next time I see you.


653
00:56:23.347 --> 00:56:25.474
Fine. But he's staying!

654
00:56:29.186 --> 00:56:32.981
- You're working for them, too?
- Don't know what you mean.


655
00:56:33.106 --> 00:56:35.567
But you can't leave with him.
You'll deal with us first!


656
00:56:40.739 --> 00:56:42.532
Do me a favor.
Get him out of here!


657
00:56:44.368 --> 00:56:45.953
- Come on!
- Let's get out of here.


658
00:56:48.038 --> 00:56:49.957
(SHOUTING)

659
00:56:55.921 --> 00:56:57.130
Cheng-ke, take him away!

660
00:57:18.235 --> 00:57:20.153
Mr. Chai, come with me to the pier!

661
00:57:46.805 --> 00:57:49.182
Listen to me! Please stop fighting!

662
00:57:50.392 --> 00:57:53.770
You can take me back to the court.
They'll give you a reward.


663
00:57:55.022 --> 00:57:56.565
That's not what I want you for.

664
00:57:56.690 --> 00:58:00.360
I want you because you've committed
arson and rape, and murder, too!


665
00:58:01.653 --> 00:58:04.114
Listen. What did you say?

666
00:58:04.239 --> 00:58:06.950
- I guess you know this man.
- A rapist and murderer!


667
00:58:08.368 --> 00:58:12.497
Stop it. Tieh chiao-San,
you've heard of chai min-yi?


668
00:58:14.249 --> 00:58:17.919
Tieh chiao-San,
I was told you were a decent man,


669
00:58:18.045 --> 00:58:19.838
'cause you joined to fight the qings.

670
00:58:20.464 --> 00:58:22.382
Haven't you heard of the leader,
chai min-yi?


671
00:58:23.383 --> 00:58:24.426
- Huh?
- Huh?


672
00:58:36.021 --> 00:58:38.815
Mr. Chai, I hear you've failed
in your campaign.


673
00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:41.234
They say you're heading
towards the south.


674
00:58:41.359 --> 00:58:45.614
My hunan friends asked me to see you.
You're no enemy.


675
00:58:45.739 --> 00:58:47.657
God damn, I'm so stupid!

676
00:58:48.325 --> 00:58:50.702
It wasn't your fault. 
It's clear now.

677
00:58:51.244 --> 00:58:52.370
- Huh?
- (LAUGHING)


678
00:58:52.496 --> 00:58:55.999
So you're known as chai min-yi?
Chu hung-yin's your false name?


679
00:58:56.583 --> 00:59:00.253
Hey. That bastard's been
misleading us all the time.


680
00:59:00.378 --> 00:59:01.630
- Hmm!
- Hey.


681
00:59:02.339 --> 00:59:04.382
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna kill him!


682
00:59:04.508 --> 00:59:06.885
Ah, just hold it.

683
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:10.138
The most important thing now is
to get Mr. Chai away. Huh?


684
00:59:10.639 --> 00:59:11.681
Right.

685
00:59:11.807 --> 00:59:14.684
Once he reaches the pier,
a boat will take him across.


686
00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:17.729
Once he's got across, he'll be safe.

687
00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:18.897
Butldoubt_

688
00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:21.608
Now, listen.
You can count on us to hold them.


689
00:59:21.733 --> 00:59:24.402
All of us will be willing
to risk our lives.


690
00:59:24.528 --> 00:59:25.570
Right.

691
00:59:26.613 --> 00:59:29.574
In that case, come with me.

692
00:59:34.538 --> 00:59:37.165
What they're doing
is trying to spread confusion,


693
00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:39.334
hoping that'll start a war among them.

694
00:59:39.459 --> 00:59:42.712
Luckily, the misunderstanding's clear.
They failed in their plans.


695
00:59:42.838 --> 00:59:46.091
- What are our plans now, then?
- Find someone to go to the pier.


696
00:59:46.216 --> 00:59:47.968
You come with us.

697
00:59:48.093 --> 00:59:51.555
We'll go out and try something.
I'm sure they have spies on us.


698
00:59:52.013 --> 00:59:53.390
We'll get rid of them, first.

699
00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:56.017
From now on,
everyone must be careful.


700
00:59:56.143 --> 00:59:58.145
What about the show tomorrow?
Shall I close it?


701
00:59:58.687 --> 01:00:00.689
Don't close it. 
They may suspect.

702
01:00:00.814 --> 01:00:03.859
You just go and do your normal routine.
I'll get some help.


703
01:00:03.984 --> 01:00:06.695
You just keep an eye
on any suspect, then tell us.


704
01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.363
- We'll fix it.
- Right.


705
01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:17.706
(TUNG CHI) We're here.

706
01:00:24.296 --> 01:00:25.797
Oh, you found it.

707
01:00:27.883 --> 01:00:30.552
Tung chi.
He must be the son of Mr. Liang.


708
01:00:31.011 --> 01:00:32.053
You're right.

709
01:00:32.179 --> 01:00:36.725
Hsiao-hu, he'll tell you everything
about the incident with chen wen-jie.


710
01:00:37.851 --> 01:00:40.103
He's a distant relative of chen ta-chun.

711
01:00:40.687 --> 01:00:42.022
Oh, Mr. Chen?

712
01:00:42.147 --> 01:00:45.567
Now, don't you worry.
Mr. Chen is trustworthy.

Sit down, sit down.

715
01:00:49.029 --> 01:00:52.407
Hey, come on, then. Let's play
a few games. Let them do their business.


716
01:00:52.532 --> 01:00:55.160
Hsiao-hu, I can read your mind.

717
01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:58.205
Although I'm a relative of chen ta-chun,

718
01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:01.666
we don't get along
because of some old grudges before.


719
01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:05.795
Also, your uncle knows me very well.
I've been working for him for years.


720
01:01:05.921 --> 01:01:08.465
If you're my uncle's friend,
then you're a friend of mine.


721
01:01:09.174 --> 01:01:14.304
The truth is, I do know
what happened during the past.


722
01:01:14.429 --> 01:01:18.225
- I can still remember it clearly.
- Do tell me.


723
01:01:19.267 --> 01:01:23.021
Your father was
a good wu-tang martial expert.


724
01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:25.982
There's not many
who can match up with him.


725
01:01:26.107 --> 01:01:29.486
Even the ten tigers find him
very hard to tackle.


726
01:01:29.611 --> 01:01:31.196
Then came this one man, li.

Li Jen-chiao, I've been waiting here
for you. I knew you would turn up.


729
01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:51.633
You are blessed. You've been lucky.
I wish I got you last time.


730
01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:55.011
En garde.
I'll let you try my wu-tang style.


731
01:02:00.475 --> 01:02:02.352
Brother li, I've arranged everything.

732
01:02:02.978 --> 01:02:05.605
- Just signal when you want any help.
- Good.


733
01:02:08.275 --> 01:02:11.194
I'd like to try your wu-tang style.
Let's begin, then!

736
01:05:28.016 --> 01:05:30.768
That's how your father got killed.
That's all I know.


737
01:05:32.312 --> 01:05:34.481
- I'll kill them all!
- You be patient.


738
01:05:35.023 --> 01:05:36.941
Listen, it's all planned.

739
01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:40.403
You know they've more people
on their side than us here.


740
01:05:40.528 --> 01:05:42.489
We will stick to our plan,

741
01:05:42.947 --> 01:05:47.452
kill the young ones first,
then we will nail all the older ones.


742
01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:49.787
By doing it this way
we split our forces.


743
01:05:49.913 --> 01:05:52.749
I do not want to make
the same mistake as your father.


744
01:05:52.874 --> 01:05:56.169
- This is our only chance.
- Good idea.


745
01:05:56.669 --> 01:05:58.755
By plan is to
kill them one by one.

746
01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.675
But they all have to be in succession,
so we get them by surprise.


747
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:06.721
I know that all the pier workers take
their morning tea in here without fail.


748
01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:10.350
We'll both disguise ourselves
and wait for chen ta-chun.


749
01:06:10.475 --> 01:06:13.853
You'll handle the lin brothers and
lin fu-sheng at the guangxiao temple.


750
01:06:13.978 --> 01:06:15.021
Right.

761
01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:41.339
Get in closer. 
Get in closer, there.

762
01:06:43.424 --> 01:06:44.467
Right.

763
01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:47.178
- Okay.
- Step back, everybody.


764
01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:49.013
Step back, please, step back.

765
01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:51.599
Give the man some room.
Step back, step back!


766
01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.476
(APPLAUSE)

767
01:06:57.230 --> 01:07:00.275
Very good, huh? Good!

768
01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:10.952
(CHEERING)

769
01:07:12.203 --> 01:07:14.747
Treasured flavors restaurant

770
01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.669
hey, don't go yet! Hey, listen.

771
01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:23.298
Something urgentjust popped up.
Can you take over my place?


772
01:07:23.423 --> 01:07:24.757
Sure, no problem.

773
01:07:24.882 --> 01:07:27.468
(TA-CHUN) This meal's on me.
I'll give you my pay for today.


774
01:07:27.594 --> 01:07:29.470
See you tomorrow.
Don't work too hard, eh?


775
01:07:29.596 --> 01:07:33.600
Hey, ta-chun, I've been looking for you.
It's lucky that I've found you.


776
01:07:34.225 --> 01:07:38.146
- Oh! Anything important?
- Oh... excuse me.


777
01:07:38.646 --> 01:07:40.106
Come here, come on. Come on.

778
01:07:40.898 --> 01:07:42.442
- Good news.
- Oh?


779
01:07:43.901 --> 01:07:45.653
- What is it?
- Let me tell you.


780
01:07:45.778 --> 01:07:49.157
- I've won a lottery!
- That so? Congratulations!


781
01:07:49.282 --> 01:07:52.869
Thank you.
I'm here to invite you to come along.


782
01:07:52.994 --> 01:07:55.705
You take a day off,
I'll book the restaurant.


783
01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:59.834
We'll both have a big feast, then visit
the brothel later in the evening.


784
01:07:59.959 --> 01:08:03.004
Huh, sounds good.
Todayjust happens to be my day off.


785
01:08:03.129 --> 01:08:04.672
But then, I've something else to do.

786
01:08:04.797 --> 01:08:09.010
Ah, do it some other time.
What's more important than having fun?


787
01:08:09.552 --> 01:08:11.512
Ta-chun, go enjoy yourself.
See you tomorrow.


788
01:08:11.638 --> 01:08:15.183
- We must leave now. Come on!
- Goodbye, goodbye. Thank you.


789
01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:18.436
- Thank you!
- Come on. Let's go.


790
01:08:19.604 --> 01:08:22.398
You're lucky. Your men encourage you
to have some fun, huh?


791
01:08:22.857 --> 01:08:25.652
Come on, let's sit down.
Sit down, have a chat, huh? Come on.


792
01:08:25.777 --> 01:08:27.612
Listen, I'd like to,
but I can't make it.

793
01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:29.989
Ah, what's so important, then?

794
01:08:30.114 --> 01:08:32.283
I'm sure you can leave it for now.
Come on, sit down.


795
01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:33.493
Hey! Don't push me.

796
01:08:33.618 --> 01:08:36.871
A friend of mine's in trouble.
I promised I'd go and help him.


797
01:08:36.996 --> 01:08:38.039
Don't be stubborn!

798
01:08:38.164 --> 01:08:40.917
Hold it. Why are you so anxious
for me to go with you?


799
01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:44.462
Mr. Chen, save your breath for now.

800
01:08:47.131 --> 01:08:50.051
There's something fishy about this.
What is it you both want?


801
01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.803
Hmm.

802
01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:56.057
You remember
what happened last night?


803
01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:58.851
Well, today it's your turn.

804
01:08:58.976 --> 01:09:01.437
Mr. Chen, you'd better go outside.

805
01:09:01.896 --> 01:09:04.691
Anyone comes, try and stop them
from coming in here.


806
01:09:04.816 --> 01:09:07.110
- Just say we're closed.
- Yeah, sure.


807
01:09:11.155 --> 01:09:12.635
There's nothing to see here, come on.

808
01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:15.326
So, I see you're the one
that did it last night.


809
01:09:15.451 --> 01:09:17.120
You're not stupid.

810
01:09:18.162 --> 01:09:19.247
Liang hsiao-hu?

811
01:09:19.372 --> 01:09:22.792
I'm not. He's somewhere else.
I'm sure you know of me.


812
01:09:23.334 --> 01:09:24.627
Tung chi sound familiar?

813
01:09:25.086 --> 01:09:27.755
Mm. You used to work
with general liang.


814
01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.133
A pity you didn'tjoin him
together in hell.


815
01:09:30.258 --> 01:09:31.843
You should've died long ago.

816
01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:33.344
(YELLING)

817
01:09:37.974 --> 01:09:41.436
Go get yourself some kind of weapon.
I want this to be a fair match.


818
01:09:41.936 --> 01:09:45.690
My speciality... anything I find
becomes a weapon!


819
01:09:46.691 --> 01:09:49.527
Good. If that's the way you want it,
suits me fine.


820
01:09:59.245 --> 01:10:00.496
Hey, look.

821
01:10:01.456 --> 01:10:03.916
- Hey, you can't go in.
- We only came for tea.


822
01:10:04.041 --> 01:10:06.085
The shop is closed.
Go somewhere else.


823
01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:08.337
Mr. Tung is trying to arrest
a wanted man.


824
01:10:08.463 --> 01:10:11.799
This whole thing is official.
Go on, go. Go on!


825
01:11:32.463 --> 01:11:34.131
(GROANING)

826

(SCREAMING)

827
01:11:47.353 --> 01:11:48.688
Let's go.

828
01:11:50.356 --> 01:11:51.566
- Hey!
- Huh?


829
01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:54.694
(LAUGHING)

830
01:11:56.112 --> 01:11:57.196
- Huh?
- Huh?


831
01:11:58.114 --> 01:12:00.324
- What is it?
- (MUTTERING)


832
01:12:21.304 --> 01:12:22.805
(MAN) Great! Fantastic!

833
01:12:26.058 --> 01:12:27.268
Thank you.

834
01:12:28.060 --> 01:12:29.687
- Look at that.
- Wow!


835
01:12:33.107 --> 01:12:36.152
Brother, you do look like
you're a martial expert.


836
01:12:36.277 --> 01:12:39.906
That's right. But then,
from what I just saw, you're better.


837
01:12:40.573 --> 01:12:42.366
You're being kind.

838
01:12:44.577 --> 01:12:46.203
Shall I give you a demonstration?

839
01:12:46.329 --> 01:12:49.248
Why not? I made enough money today.
I think we'll close.


840
01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:51.751
- Come on.
- Thank you.


841
01:12:51.876 --> 01:12:53.210
Let's go over here, then.

842
01:12:53.336 --> 01:12:55.755
Tomorrow. Come again tomorrow.
Thank you, thank you.


843
01:12:56.422 --> 01:12:57.590
Thank you very much.

844
01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.103
Let's start.

845
01:13:56.148 --> 01:13:58.275
- (SCREAMING)
- (LAUGHING)


846
01:14:08.119 --> 01:14:09.286
Huh?

847
01:14:09.412 --> 01:14:10.705
(SHOUTING)

848
01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:32.018
(SCREAMING)

01:14:36.731 --> 01:14:37.857
(MUTTERING)

850
01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:40.818
Murderer!

851
01:14:41.485 --> 01:14:42.528
Murderer!

852
01:14:43.738 --> 01:14:45.322
- Get back, get back!
- Stand aside!


853
01:14:45.448 --> 01:14:47.408
Move away, there! Make way!

854
01:14:50.077 --> 01:14:51.120
Murderer!

855
01:14:52.872 --> 01:14:56.125
Listen to me, folks.
He is a wanted criminal.


856
01:14:57.168 --> 01:15:00.463
That's why he's dead.
I need cooperation.


857
01:15:01.756 --> 01:15:06.052
If his friends come, no one is to say
a word about what happened.


858
01:15:06.844 --> 01:15:10.556
Those who disobey
will find themselves in jail.


859
01:15:10.681 --> 01:15:12.058
I hope that is clear.

860
01:15:12.933 --> 01:15:14.477
(MUTTERING)

861
01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:20.941
Uncle...

862
01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:24.945
You'll stay here
and wait for lin fu-sheng.


863
01:15:25.446 --> 01:15:28.991
I have to go now.
You know what to do when he turns up.


864
01:15:29.116 --> 01:15:30.993
- Mm.
- Take 'em away!


865
01:15:31.118 --> 01:15:32.411
Sir!

866
01:15:46.509 --> 01:15:47.927
Showtime!

867
01:15:53.641 --> 01:15:55.434
Come on, come on, come on.

868
01:16:01.649 --> 01:16:03.984
- Where's lin fu-sheng?
- Who's lookin' for him?


869
01:16:04.110 --> 01:16:08.197
Oh, it's me...
Just a friend of his.


870
01:16:08.322 --> 01:16:10.074
-Soaml
- oh.


871
01:16:10.199 --> 01:16:12.701
They went to attend a friend's funeral,
won't be back today.


872
01:16:12.827 --> 01:16:15.162
They asked me to look after the store.

873
01:16:24.672 --> 01:16:26.924
- What's your name, then?
- Uh...


874
01:16:28.717 --> 01:16:30.219
Oh, it's lin chiao-hu.

875
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:38.310
How odd. Same family name.

876
01:16:38.435 --> 01:16:41.105
Oh, not quite the same.
I'm only a distant cousin.


877
01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:44.108
Oh! Ha-ha!
Lin is very enterprising.


878
01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.734
Oh, common name.

879
01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.154
- That right?
- Mm.


880
01:16:48.279 --> 01:16:50.823
Hey, uh, it's important
you see him today?


881
01:16:51.574 --> 01:16:53.534
We're supposed to have a match.

882
01:16:53.659 --> 01:16:57.371
Oh? A friendly match?
Well, let me take his place.


883
01:16:57.496 --> 01:16:59.665
Ha! You're nowhere near to it.

884
01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:01.917
Lin fu-sheng's very good. Ha!

885
01:17:02.042 --> 01:17:04.712
He's the number one pupil
of famous tieh chiao-San,


886
01:17:04.837 --> 01:17:06.255
pupil of beggar su.

887
01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:07.423
Oh?

888
01:17:07.923 --> 01:17:10.551
And lin ping is the only pupil
of wang yin-iin.


889
01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.845
Of the ten kwangtung tigers,

890
01:17:12.970 --> 01:17:15.139
they have mastered half
of the tigers' skills.


891
01:17:15.264 --> 01:17:17.766
Oh, that I do know.
Lin fu-sheng is good.


892
01:17:18.225 --> 01:17:20.853
Ha! Need I say, he's number one?

893
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:23.355
- Hey.
- Hmm?


894
01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:25.983
Since you're a brother
to lin fu-sheng,


895
01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:27.776
he must've taught you
some of his kung fu.


896
01:17:27.902 --> 01:17:32.323
Oh, I'm not as good as him.
But I'm a competent fighter.


897
01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:34.658
- Oh, that's good.
- Alright, then.


898
01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:37.536
We've both been wanting
to learn the ten tigers' kung fu.


899
01:17:37.661 --> 01:17:39.455
Hey, you watch this.

900
01:17:48.505 --> 01:17:49.673
Hmm.

901
01:18:13.906 --> 01:18:14.949
Hey, er...

902
01:18:18.118 --> 01:18:19.161
Thank you.

903
01:18:36.971 --> 01:18:39.390
This is tieh chiao
-San's kung fu.

904
01:18:39.515 --> 01:18:43.102
He stand like solid rock.
His arms are strong, aggressive.


905
01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:45.729
He's unbeatable.

906
01:18:47.898 --> 01:18:49.775
- You try.
- Right.


907
01:19:23.392 --> 01:19:24.685
(GRUNTS)

908
01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:28.522
Oh, thank you, thank you.

909
01:19:30.441 --> 01:19:32.693
- Hey, light these.
- Sure.


910
01:19:38.282 --> 01:19:39.575
Oh!

911
01:19:41.535 --> 01:19:42.953
Steady, now.

912
01:19:44.496 --> 01:19:47.916
Not too much smoke, is it?
Close your eyes, it'll be alright.


913
01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:51.170
(CHUCKLES)

01:19:54.673 --> 01:19:56.842
Now, just keep it up. You alright?

01:19:56.967 --> 01:19:58.635
(YOWLING)

917
01:19:58.761 --> 01:20:01.430
- How come you're so hopeless?
- You try it, then!


918
01:20:01.555 --> 01:20:04.558
You've no willpower at all.
(TUTTING)


919
01:20:05.184 --> 01:20:08.228
You're just not cut out
for this sort of kung fu.


920
01:20:08.354 --> 01:20:09.855
You're not strong enough.

921
01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.899
We'll try wang yin-iin's
famous lama style.


922
01:20:12.024 --> 01:20:14.151
- Huh?
- Hmm.

924
01:20:21.241 --> 01:20:23.160
- Better now?
- (CHUCKLING)


925
01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:28.540
The lama style... basically, it's different
from the Poles you practiced before.


926
01:20:28.665 --> 01:20:31.919
Same in principle, though.
Pity we don't have any Poles.


927
01:20:32.044 --> 01:20:34.171
Hey, but we can use those jars there.

928
01:20:35.089 --> 01:20:36.924
Hey, hold it! Those are mine.

929
01:20:37.049 --> 01:20:39.093
Huh? Oh, thank you.

930
01:20:39.218 --> 01:20:41.095
- Hmm.
- Okay.


931
01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.638
(LAUGHING)

932
01:20:44.681 --> 01:20:46.058

Ahh! Ahh!

01:21:39.736 --> 01:21:40.779
Huh?

936
01:21:46.618 --> 01:21:50.122
- What are you doing that for?
- We're just practicing beggar kung fu.


937
01:22:02.092 --> 01:22:03.552
- Come on!
- Let's go!


938
01:22:10.100 --> 01:22:13.103
Don't be afraid.
We'll help you with your practice.

You filthy swine! 
It's not fair!

949
01:22:46.929 --> 01:22:49.306
You're not giving me a fair chance.

950
01:22:50.516 --> 01:22:54.228
You gave no one a chance.
Why should we play fair?


951
01:22:54.353 --> 01:22:56.104
You don't deserve it.

Hey! Over here! Over here!

- Right!

- You both understand what I said?
- Yes, we do.

01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:31.974
You must be careful.

958
01:23:32.099 --> 01:23:35.227
Because we can't be with you.
You'll depend on yourselves.

- Go, then.

what's with this fighting?

We got enough problems!

- I don't know!

No games.

Wang chiao-ming, lin fu-sheng,
I know that you're both only pretending.

So save time, let's play for real!

If tung chi's here, then tung ba
shouldn't be too far away.

Huh. You're not that stupid.
I've been here some time.
