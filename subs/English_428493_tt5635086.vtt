Did you look in on him?

That heifer needs looking at, he said.

Maybe next time you'll frame yourself.

56
00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.676
I could have been quicker,
hobbling around on these damn things.


57
00:09:42.868 --> 00:09:44.960
Thank God that lad's on his way.
- Yeah, I could've managed.


58
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:47.090
I have done so far.
- Yeah, course you have.

you can have.


63
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.990
Go easy on that.
I want that lad picking up in good time.


64
00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.190
Why do I have to go?
- Oh, wind your neck in.


65
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.170
I didn't even want him here, did I?
- He were the only bugger to apply'


66
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.200
Let's at least get him here
in one piece, shall we'?


67
00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.930
Whatever.
It's always down to muggins here.

That'll be as much use
as a chocolate fireguard up here.


75
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.440
It's a bit of a midden, like.

76
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.890
That thing unfolds out
into like a bed thing.

77
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:34.970
You can switch that on, but it's
a gas bottle, mind, so don't go mad wi' it.


78
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:37.530
There's a bog in there.

79
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.270
This looks OK.

80
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.300

-Paki or summat?

81
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.070
Pardon?

82
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.220
Er, no, I am from Romania.

83
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.510

- Please don't call me that.

I always end up gipping my guts up.


91
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.120
When were you last on a train?

92
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:51.150
I'm just saying.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:55.200
It's 100 odd Swaledale

Do you understand me?

95
00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:00.720
And what about milk?

96
00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.480
Just got a few beef cattle,
nowt much to speak of.


97
00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.980
No, sorry, the sheep.
Do you make cheese?


98
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.250
It's very good cheese,
and good money.

DEIHDRE:
Your English is good.


100
00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.820
My mother teaches English
back in Romania.


101
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:17.970
Fancy.

102
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.020
We muddle through on our own
most of t' time


103
00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.310
but wi' lambing and that
our lad needs extra help.


104
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.330
It's perfect for me.

105
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:29.960
You got somewhere to go after?

106
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.340
Good, cos we just need someone
for the week, lad.


107
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.040
We're not running a charity
for waifs and strays, like.


108
00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.240
Have you pressed my collared shirt, Nan?

109
00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:44.100
It's hung up in your wardrobe.

110
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.540
If you would but try looking further
than your own backside.


111
00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.170
Right. Got any clean socks an' all?

112
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.270
Go easy on the sauce tonight, lad.

113
00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:54.150
I need you to take me
up to Top Fell early tomorrow


114
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.010
show them ewes to this one.

115
00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:57.590
They'll be ripe to drop.

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.780
Do you hear me?
- Aye, I've heard you.

if he fancies a pint'?


120
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.300
No, please, it's OK.

121
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.070
I've been travelling a long time.

122
00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.750
It's best I will
just go to sleep tonight.

123
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:16.660

Alright?

127
00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.610
Er, get us a pint in, Han.
I'll just be a sec.


128
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.130
What's up wi' you?
- Nowt.


129
00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.170
Well, do you wanna tell your face?

130
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.410
Is your dad any better?
- No, he's getting on wi' it, you know.


131
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.960
It must be tough for yous.
- It's a' right.


132
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.140
I thought once you lot escaped to your fancy
colleges and that, you'd never come back.


133
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.070
It's reading week, isn't it?
You know what me mam's like.


134
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.520
Came up with a couple of my uni mates.
Makes it bearable.


135
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.750
Brought 'em to gawp
and laugh at the natives?


136
00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:56.900
Get over yourself.

137
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.950
You're not that interesting
as a local tourist attraction.


138
00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:04.090
Got a spare one of them or what?

139
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.720
Come on, you tight wad.
I'm just a poor student.


140
00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:09.420
Come on.

141
00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:22.090
Ta.

142
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.470
We should have a night out.
Bradford or somewhere?


143
00:17:27.090 --> 00:17:29.990
What?
- That's what I love about folk like you.


144
00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:31.860
You fuck off
to your posh colleges an' that


145
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.500
and swan back here on your holidays,
thinking you know it all.


146
00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:38.390
Some of us just have
to get on wi' it, like.


147
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:40.720
Alright. It's just a night out.
- Aye, to you.


148
00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.920
I'll tell me cows they can go
without their teas shall I


149
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.710
cos I'm off gallivanting
around Bradford?


150
00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:47.800
You'd like my uni mates.
They're a laugh.


151
00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:49.530
One of them's a real laugh.

152
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.820
What do you mean by that?

153
00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:53.960
He's nice. You'd like him.
He's funny.


154
00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:55.560
Remember? Like you used to be.

155
00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:57.770
Before I had to join the real world.

156
00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.700
You know what? Forget it.

Hey, will you get out of my cab'?

Right. You can lamb up on t' fell,
rebuild that wall while you're at it.

- Getting on with it.

Do you wanna tell me
what that muck is in my best tea towel?

Cheese. Gheorghe made it.

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.190
He milked one of the sheep, like.

354
01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:23.940
Have you tried it?
- No, ta.

I see you helped yourself to breakfast.
- Aye.

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.840
Gheorghe did eggs and that'

357

He's a good lad.

He's gonna stay on for a bit.

360
01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.460
Just so as you're clear,
he's here to work.

01:07:38.590 --> 01:07:39.410
Yeah, I know.

362
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:43.130
Right. Just so you're clear.
- I am.


363
01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:46.490
He's gonna fill in

Till he's up and about, like.

366
01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:53.640
Your dad's not gonna get
any better, John.


367
01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.370
You don't know that. He might.

368
01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:59.240
We were this close to losing him.

369
01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:01.440
Got to face facts, lad.

370
01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.640
I'm off to t' pub. You coming?

371
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:46.910
Did you come here
on your own, then, to England?


372
01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:47.930
Yeah.

373
01:08:50.670 --> 01:08:53.210
There was someone once but...

374
01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:55.340
Right.

375
01:09:01.150 --> 01:09:02.220
Will you go back?

376
01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.620
My country is dead.

377
01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:12.360
You can't throw a rock in most towns
without hitting an old lady


378
01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:14.470
crying for her children who have gone.

379
01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:20.070
I was thinking...

380
01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:24.720
I'm not sure what's gonna happen now
with our dad the way he is, but...


381
01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:29.080
how would it be
if you stayed on, like'?


382
01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:32.390
I've told you, I can stay.
- Yeah.


383
01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:37.030
I guess I just... mean for longer.

384
01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:39.650
It'd be sweet, right?

385
01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:47.720
And how would we work on the farm?

386
01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:49.460
How do you mean?

387
01:09:50.490 --> 01:09:55.820
Well, it can't go on like it has.
You must see that, no?


388
01:09:56.930 --> 01:10:00.160
What's the farm got to do with you?
- If I stayed, a lot.


389
01:10:02.290 --> 01:10:03.890
I've been through this before.

390
01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:08.170
On my farm.
I can't go through that again.


391
01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:14.080
It will not survive, believe me.

392
01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:20.040
Have you talked to Martin and Deirdre?
- They'll be fine.


393
01:10:20.100 --> 01:10:21.380
Will they?
- Yeah.


394
01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:24.870
And how will you be?

395
01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:28.600

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:35.230
It's not like I'm asking you
to get wed or anything.


399
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:38.030
No, but you're asking me
to stay here with you.


400
01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.160
Do you understand me?
- Alright!

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:11.360
What is it?

484
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:16.750
I got that antiseptic for the sheep.

485
01:31:17.230 --> 01:31:19.320
That's good.
- Aye.


486
01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:21.570
She's doing a lot better.

487
01:31:22.650 --> 01:31:23.190
Good.

488
01:31:24.570 --> 01:31:25.850
I thought you'd be pleased.

489
01:31:26.690 --> 01:31:28.800
I'm pleased you're helping the sheep.

490
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:41.660
Why did you just leave?

491
01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:54.380
You shouldn't have come.
I'm not the answer.


492
01:31:54.460 --> 01:31:55.440
Yeah. I know.

493
01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.460
But I needed to see you.
- And now you do.


494
01:32:01.540 --> 01:32:04.190
I thought... if I could see you

495
01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.410
talk to you

496
01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:09.080
I could make things better.
You know?


497
01:32:12.170 --> 01:32:13.490
Try at least.

498
01:32:17.571 --> 01:32:18.868
Anyroad...

499
01:32:22.071 --> 01:32:23.288
Is that it?

500
01:32:29.060 --> 01:32:30.200
Nothing else?

501
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:39.960
I should...

502
01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:41.170
Yeah.

503
01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:42.990
OK.

504
01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:57.140
I'm trying to do this.

505
01:32:57.770 --> 01:33:00.870
Don't you see?
I'm.“ I'm trying to sort it out.


506
01:33:02.820 --> 01:33:06.880
And I've come all this way up here,
on a coach and everything.


507
01:33:08.860 --> 01:33:10.470
And I want you to come back.

508
01:33:11.930 --> 01:33:12.860
With me'

509
01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:19.500
And I want us to be together.

510
01:33:28.750 --> 01:33:30.620
I don't want to be a fuck-up anymore.

511
01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:33.620
No, leave me. I'm fine.

512
01:33:37.810 --> 01:33:39.080
I want to be with you.

513
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:45.800
And that's what I needed to say.

514
01:33:59.270 --> 01:34:00.560
You're a freak.

515
01:34:05.290 --> 01:34:06.180
So are you.

516
01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:09.810
Faggot.

517
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:17.840
Fuck off...

518
01:34:19.210 --> 01:34:20.100
...faggot.
