00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.750
说真的
It's what I'm talking about.


136
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.560
是啊  那就...
Yeah, right. Yeah, let's--


137
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.360
-再看一遍  -别这样  拜托
- let's watch it again. - No, I can't, I can't! Please.


138
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.060
懂没  就是这意思
See, that's what I'm talking about.


139
00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.730
这帮人真不可置信
Now can you believe these guys?


140
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.400
<b>独立民主党人  却力挺麦凯恩竞选</b>

141
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.400
他想要利伯曼做竞选搭档
He wants Lieberman on the ticket.


142
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.640
-那是自然  -那就悲剧了
- Of course he does. - Disaster.


143
00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.370
也可能载入史册
Or historic.


144
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.670
-或者载入史册的悲剧  -约翰喜欢他
- Or historic disaster. - John loves him.


145
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.140
这可能是两党联合上的一大壮举
It would be a strong move towards bi-partisanship.


146
00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.380
各位  基础选民已经在担心
Guys, the base is already concerned


147
00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.120
约翰不是正宗的保守派
that John is not a true conservative.


148
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.020
我不觉得选一个支持堕胎的犹太裔民主党
Now, I don't think picking a pro-choice Jewish Democrat


149
00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.920
还曾是阿尔·戈尔竞选伙伴
who just happened to be Al Gore's running mate


150
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.590
能减少这种疑虑
is going to alleviate that concern.


151
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.530
也许我们能让麦凯恩宣誓不连任
Maybe we have McCain make a one-term pledge.


152
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.000
他在某个大型演讲上宣布
He announces in some huge speech that


153
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.430
他和一名民主党人将联合执政一个任期
he and a Democrat are joining together for one term


154
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.600
以便让两党联合起来
so that the parties can come together


155
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.110
解决国家的重大问题
and solve this country's greatest problems.


156
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.710
也许  如果宣誓不连任的话
Maybe, with a one-term pledge.


157
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.550
没有比选乔·利伯曼更表明我们国家为先了
Nothing says country first like picking Joe Lieberman.


158
00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.950
如果要奏效  就要绝对保密
Well, if it's gonna work, it has to remain absolutely secret,


159
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:48.820
一直到党代会才揭晓
right up until the convention.


160
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:51.390
要是泄漏了  右派会搞砸一切
If it gets leaked, the right will kill it.


161
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.090
约翰·麦凯恩决定在大会期间
John McCain's decision to put Joe Lieberman


162
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.430
将乔·利伯曼推上前台  
front and center at his convention


163
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.530
让民主党和共和党都颇感不安
has the unique distinction of unsettling both Democrats and Republicans.


164
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.310
我认为  让他成为
I think the idea of him being


165
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.050
共和党的副总统候选人
the Republican vice presidential nominee


166
00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:06.300
可能导致大会分裂
would split the convention.


167
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.540
作为内阁成员  没问题  但不能是副总统
In the cabinet, fine. Not as V.P.


168
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.340
糟糕的选择  保守派会疏离本党的
Bad choice. Conservatives will bolt.


169
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.640
麦凯恩和利伯曼的组合太怪异了
Comedy team of McCain and Lieberman.


170
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:14.780
也就玩玩大西洋城能有希望
Maybe they'll play Atlantic city this summer.


171
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.480
谢谢
Thank you.


172
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.750
出了什么事
So what the fuck happened?


173
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.780
林赛·格雷厄姆想给这个想法寻求支持
Lindsey Graham was trying to build support for the idea


174
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.950
-结果消息走漏了  -该死的  林赛
- and it leaked. - God damn it, Lindsey.


175
00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:27.550
权当安慰吧
Well, if it's any consolation,


176
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.720
数据表明  如果你选择了利伯曼
my numbers show that if you pick Lieberman


177
00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.130
或者任何支持堕胎的候选人
or any pro-choice candidate,


178
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:36.130
你40%的核心支持者都可能不再支持你

179
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.560
40%啊

180
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.860
无党派人士的支持几乎不会增加
And you gain very few independents.


181
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.700
总体来说  各方都不讨好
Overall, it's a wide-net negative.


182
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:44.000
我们打了很多电话  有些人觉得
We've made a lot of calls. Some people don't even think


183
00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:46.140
利伯曼甚至不会通过大会的同意
Lieberman can make it through the convention.


184
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:50.040
其他人说  他能当上  但会撕裂党派
Others say, yeah, he can, but he's gonna rip the party in half.


185
00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.910
但乔很完美  我们都是
But Joe is perfect. We're both mavericks


186
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:54.550
被党内混蛋痛恨的异端
that are hated by the assholes in our own parties.


187
00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.320
联手能对国家产生巨大的正面作用
It could have a tremendous healing effect on the country.


188
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.680
没有基础选民的支持  我们没法获胜
We can't win without our base.


189
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.550
选利伯曼是治国良策  但不是获胜之道
Lieberman is the right thing to do, but the wrong way to win.


190
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.190
还审核过谁
Who all have we vetted?


191
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.330
罗姆尼  克里斯特  波仑蒂
Romney, Crist, Pawlenty.


192
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.330
-正在审核彭博  -谁能帮我们赢得竞选呢
- We're trying to vet Bloomberg. - Who can we win with?


193
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.030
-都不能  -都不能
- None of them. - None of them?


194
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.670
约翰  奥巴马改变了整个竞选基调
John, Obama just changed the entire dynamic.


195
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.740
时代不同了啊
It is a change year, sir.


196
00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:21.770
我们急需改变规则的人选
We desperately need a game-changing pick,


197
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.640
这些中年白人男士可不是什么改变规则的人
and none of these middle-aged white guys are game-changers.


198
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:29.010
那...怎么办
So...what?


199
00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.850
我就自认倒霉  甘愿输掉
I just fuck off and die?


200
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.520
数据显示  我们得做四件事
Well, the data shows we have four things we have to do.


201
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.950
赢回无党派人士的支持
We have to win back the independents,


202
00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:38.390
激起基础选民的热情
we have to excite the base,


203
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.820
和布什政府拉开距离
we have to distance ourselves from the Bush administration,


204
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.190
还必须减少女性选民的支持率差距
and we have to close the gender gap.


205
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:46.900
差距有多大
How bad is the gap?


206
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.360
相当大
It's fatal.


207
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.540
你的男性支持率领先20个百分点  这很好
You've got a 20% advantage with men, which is great,


208
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.840
但女性支持率低了20个百分点
but a 20% deficit with women.


209
00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.670
你得在女性选民支持率上提升15个百分点
You've got to pick up 15% with females.


210
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.380
如果在这块落后5个百分点以上
Because if you're trailing by more than five with them,


211
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.880
你就输了
you lose.


212
00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:08.450
那就给我找个女人来
So find me a woman.


213
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.090
女士们  谁会中选呢
All right, ladies. Who's it gonna be?


214
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:25.360
梅格·惠特曼支持堕胎
Meg Whitman supports abortion rights.


215
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:30.370
支持堕胎  支持堕胎
Pro-choice, pro-choice.


216
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.480
-你是谁呢  -这组太阳能电池板
- Who are you? - These solar arrays combined


217
00:10:36.510 --> 00:10:40.450
将为我们提供三千四百万瓦的电力
will allow us to produce 34 megawatts of power...


218
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:48.720
为保障风险管理成为我们保障...
To make sure that risk management is the best that we can do to secure...


219
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:53.990
众所周知  奥古斯塔没有收费公路
But as you know, the turnpike ends here in Augusta.


220
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.860
基于这点...
At that point...


221
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:03.400
她叫什么来着
What was her name?


222
00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:11.140
一旦阿拉斯加获准 安全可靠地开发本土资源
Once Alaska is allowed to very responsibly and safely develop our resources,


223
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.210
将能降低全美的能源支出
we'll lower costs of energy across the United States,


224
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.860
由此能为国家提供
and then we'd be able to secure the nation


225
00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.480
洁净的国内能源供应
with a clean, domestic supply of energy.


226
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.150
另外  从我个人的角度
And I say that, Charlie, even personally.


227
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.550
我的独子今年十八岁
My one and only son, my 18-year-old,


228
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:26.390
刚刚报名参了军
he just signed up for the United States Army.


229
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.860
现在正在新兵训练营
He's at boot camp right now.


230
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:29.320
我就想
And I'm thinkin', you know,


231
00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.160
这孩子正竭尽全力
this kid is doing all that he can within his power


232
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.800
保卫国家的安全
to help secure and defend the United States.


233
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:39.530
每位民选官员都该扪心自问
Every elected official had better be asking themselves,


234
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.970
你们也能做到这样吗
are you doing as much also?


235
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.210
你们倾尽全力了吗
Are you doing all that you can?


236
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.210
她是个明星
She's a star.


237
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:51.710
她强烈反对堕胎  因此在四十四岁时
She's so passionately pro-life that at age 44,


238
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.250
她没有打掉一个
she decided to keep a child


239
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.480
怀孕中期被诊断出有唐氏综合症的孩子
that she knew mid-term had Down's Syndrome.


240
00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.950
还有很多地方  基础选民会喜欢她
And there's a lot more that the base will love.


241
00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:02.020
她在阿拉斯加有80%的支持率
She has an 80% approval rating in Alaska.


242
00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.090
-全国各州之最  -80%吗
- The highest of any governor in the country-- - 80%?


243
00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:07.660
她反对石油游说集团
And she got it by taking on the oil lobby


244
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:09.560
和共和党当权派  还能有如此支持率
and the Republican establishment.


245
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.270
<b>当地政府层打算斥资22亿美元打造的大桥
其另一端格拉维纳岛人烟稀少</b>


246
00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.270
她否决了绝路桥
She's the one who killed the bridge to nowhere.


247
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.570
我为了那破桥和泰德·史蒂文斯争论了好几个月
I fought Ted Stevens for months on that stupid fucking bridge.


248
00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.370
此外  她是个虔诚的基督徒
Plus, she is a devout Christian.


249
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.740
她儿子即将入伍前往伊拉克
She's got a son about to deploy to Iraq,


250
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.510
是个有五个孩子的辣妈

251
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.210
-她喜欢狩猎麋鹿  -狩猎麋鹿吗
- She likes to moose hunt. - Moose hunt?


252
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.740
这女人会拿枪啊  约翰
This is a woman with a gun, John.


253
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.110
基础选民要兴奋得跳起来的
I mean, come on, the base is gonna be doing back flips.


254
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.650
萨尔特怎么看
What does Salter think?


255
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.580
他担心她是个神创论者
Uh, he's worried that she's a creationist.


256
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.450
所以基础选民才会喜欢她啊
Yeah, and that's exactly why the base will love her.


257
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:36.960
女性会喜欢她
Women will love her.


258
00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.460
还有  她让你和布什的形象拉开距离
Plus, she gives you distance from bush.


259
00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.560
更进一步  她如此与众不同
Furthermore, she's so outside the box


260
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.130
说不定能帮你重塑特立独行的名声
that she helps you recapture the Maverick label,


261
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.060
帮你赢回无党派人士
which will win back independents.


262
00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.170
她是完美人选
She's everything we need.


263
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.240
你不觉得她太与众不同了吗
You don't think she might be too outside the box?


264
00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:59.310
所以这才是个特立独行的决策啊
Huh. Well, that's what makes her such a Maverick choice.


265
00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.410
选择利伯曼也是
So is picking Lieberman.


266
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:03.510
那可是相当特立独行
That'd be pretty goddamn mavericky.


267
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:08.420
先生  这是一个娱乐至死的年代
Sir, we live in the age of YouTube and the 24-hour news cycle.


268
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:10.150
否则你觉得
How else do you think a man


269
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.420
一个毫无建树的人
who has absolutely no major life accomplishments


270
00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:17.290
是怎么大比分打败一个美国英雄的
is beating an American hero by double digits?


271
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:20.830
他只是充分发挥了自己的魅力和明星效应
He's simply sailing on his charisma and star power.


272
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.130
我们得创造这次竞选中的翻身机会
We need to create a dynamic moment in this campaign


273
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:26.670
否则就死定了
or we're dead.


274
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.570
你觉得她有那么好吗
You think she's that good?


275
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:29.810
很有可能
She could be.


276
00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.870
五天内能审查完毕吗
And we can vet her in five days?


277
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.210
可以
We can.


278
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.140
她的审查必须和其他人的
The vet has to be as thorough for her


279
00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.510
一样详细完善
as it was for all the other candidates.


280
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.880
库尔华豪斯说他能做到  那么...
Culvahouse says he can do it, so...


281
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.850
时间紧迫  先生
The clock is ticking, sir.


282
00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:45.790
如果你在认真考虑这位阿拉斯加女州长
If you are going to seriously consider the governor of Alaska,


283
00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:48.090
现在就要联系她了
you have to call her now.


284
00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:55.500
州长  油价高得要人命啊
You know, Governor, these gas prices are killing us.


285
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.130
老天  我知道
 Oh, my goodness, don't I know it.


286
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.870
也要我和托德的命
They're killing me and Todd, too.


287
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:00.300
你好哇
Hey, how are ya?


288
00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:01.570
但是  一旦阿拉斯加获准
But once Alaska is allowed to


289
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.670
安全可靠地开发自身能源
very safely and responsibly develop our resources,


290
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.840
将能降低全美的能源支出
we'll lower cost of energy across the entire nation.


291
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.280
继续加油  州长
You keep giving 'em hell, Governor.


292
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:11.210
谢谢  很高兴和你谈话
Aw, thanks. Nice talking to ya.


293
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.180
妈妈  我们现在可以去玩过山车吗
Mom, can we go on the roller coaster now?


294
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:14.650
当然不行  宝贝
Yeah. No, of course, honey.


295
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.250
-布里斯托  -嗯
- Hey, Bristol? - Yeah?


296
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.690
帮我抱一下特里戈好吗  我要带派博玩过山车
Can you hold Trig? I'm gonna take Piper on the roller coaster.


297
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.050
-好的  -给
- Sure. - There you go.


298
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.920
好了  小家伙
There you go, buddy.


299
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.130
-妈妈  -等一下  宝贝
- Mom. - Just one second, hon.


300
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.430
我是萨拉
This is Sarah.


301
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:40.190
亚利桑那州  赛多纳

302
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:40.190
8月27日

303
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:57.790
州长  非常感谢您这么快就来了
Thank you for coming on such short notice, Governor.


304
00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.620
一切顺利的话
Should this go according to plan,


305
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.660
明天早上我们将带你到麦凯恩参议员的
we will take you to meet Senator McCain at his compound


306
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.290
住所见他
first thing in the morning.


307
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.530
要是他选你做竞选搭档
Now, if he chooses you to be his running mate,


308
00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:09.270
那你立刻会成为
you will instantly become


309
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.400
这世界上最有名的人之一
one of the most famous people on the planet.


310
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.740
你的过去将被调查
Your life will be investigated,


311
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.270
生活将受操控  扭曲
manipulated, distorted,


312
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.640
没有一丝的隐私
and you will lose any semblance of privacy.


313
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.980
你还100%确定
Knowing this, are you 100% committed


314
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.210
要加入吗
to going forward with this project?


315
00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:25.780
肯定的
Absolutely.


316
00:15:25.810 --> 00:15:27.880
我有一颗为人民服务的心
I have a servant's heart.


317
00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.120
如果你们真认为我有利于竞选
And if you really think I can help this ticket,


318
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.190
真认为我有助于这个国家
if you really think I can help this country,


319
00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.420
那肯定的  我愿意
then absolutely... I'll do this with ya.


320
00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:40.330
你的私生活将受到严厉甚至无理的抨击
Your private life will be subjected to harsh, often unfair attacks.


321
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.730
你无法预期...
Nothing can prepare you for...


322
00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.300
会有多卑劣  无法...
How ugly this can be. Not...


323
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.230
这我很清楚  这样子的
I do understand that. Here's the deal.


324
00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.370
我在阿拉斯加经历过残酷的初选
I went through a tough primary in Alaska,


325
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.240
我很清楚会有多卑劣
and I know how ugly it can get.


326
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.380
州长  总统选举
Well, Governor, things can get


327
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:57.410
可会残酷很多
quite a bit rougher on the national stage.


328
00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.240
这不好说  阿拉斯加可是相当残酷了
I don't know, Alaska's pretty rough.


329
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.180
你和麦凯恩参议员
Now, you and Senator McCain


330
00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.020
在一些问题上政见不一
have a difference of opinion on several issues.


331
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.520
他反对堕胎  但如果是强奸  乱伦导致怀孕
He is pro-life, but he's in favor of exceptions


332
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.760
或者孕妇有生命危险时  他并不反对
in the case of rape, incest or a mother's life being at risk.


333
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:12.690
-你却不是  -没错
- You are not. - That is correct.


334
00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:15.160
我反对所有堕胎
I am unapologetically pro-life.


335
00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.900
麦凯恩参议员支持干细胞研究
Senator McCain supports stem cell research.


336
00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.100
-而你不支持  -没错  我不支持
- You do not. - That's true, I do not.


337
00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.740
约翰·麦凯恩不会让你摒弃自己的政见
John McCain would never ask you to contradict your beliefs,


338
00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:28.240
但我们希望你全力支持他的政见
but we expect you to support his positions.


339
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.510
我们可能让你在竞选广告中
And we may ask you to appear in ads


340
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.210
拥护他的政见
advocating those positions.


341
00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.780
你对此有意见吗
Do you have a problem with that?


342
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.980
完全没意见
No, I don't. Not at all.


343
00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.320
我会全力支持麦凯恩参议员
Senator McCain can count on my full support.


344
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.250
我会很荣幸成为他团队的一员
I would be so proud to be a member of his team.


345
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.990
你不接受进化论吗
Do you reject the theory of evolution?


346
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.530
我父亲是名科学老师
I'm the daughter of a science teacher.


347
00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.700
我看着我父亲的化石模型长大的
My dad showed me fossils growing up.


348
00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.640
我了解进化论  我相信进化论
I know about evolution. I accept evolution.


349
00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:03.500
但我不否认我看到上帝之手
But I will never deny that I see the hand of God


350
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:08.880
在创造这个美丽星球中的作用
in this beautiful creation that is earth.


351
00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.320
我真的很高兴
I'm really glad that you're asking me


352
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:18.020
你们问我这类问题
these types of questions.


353
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.520
为什么
Why is that?


354
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:24.390
这样你们就能全面了解我
It's important that you know exactly what you're getting.


355
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.230
约翰  我明说了吧
John, let me be very clear.


356
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:29.660
其他审查都做了四到八周时间
Every other vet we did was over a four-to-eight-week period.


357
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:31.320
A.B.库尔华豪斯
审查律师


358
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.370
而这一次秘密审查只用了不到五天时间
This vet has been compiled in absolute secrecy


359
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.400
就完成了
in less than five days.


360
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:35.330
我明白
I understand.


361
00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:37.000
审查做得这么快
Well, in doing a vet this fast,


362
00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.110
必然有可能
there's certainly the possibility


363
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.810
有所遗漏
that we may have missed something.


364
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.510
我明白  那你觉得怎么样呢  A.B.
Yeah, I got it. What do you think, A.B.?


365
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.010
我对她在调查表上的回答很满意
I like many of her answers in the questionnaire.


366
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.130
面谈时
And in the interview,


367
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.450
我提的一些问题她也回答得很好
she hit some of my questions out of the park.


368
00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.820
这样看来
Now...


369
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:53.650
比起其他的候选人
There are more potential land mines with Palin


370
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.850
佩林的风险更大些
than with the other choices.


371
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:59.190
她说她十几岁的女儿怀孕了
She told us she has a teen daughter who's pregnant.


372
00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.560
这倒不会有多大影响
That should not prevent this from moving forward,


373
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.630
但不知道还会有什么事冒出来
but we don't know what else could pop up.


374
00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.700
那你个人对她印象好吗
But are you impressed with her personally?


375
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:13.300
挺好的
I am.


376
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.340
她的经历很丰富
She has a great life story


377
00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.880
就她目前的处境来说
and she's extremely poised and confident


378
00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:20.780
她表现得很镇定  很自信
for someone in her situation.


379
00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.650
但是这个候选人
But you have a candidate


380
00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.550
只做了18个月州长
who's only been governor for 18 months.


381
00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:27.780
在此之前  她只是一个小城的市长
Before that, she was the mayor of a small town


382
00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:29.950
那城市人口才一万人
with 10,000 people.


383
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.720
我们主攻奥巴马没经验这点
She undercuts your best attack on Obama


384
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.790
会受到她的影响
that he's too inexperienced.


385
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.290
那正好
Well, that's played out.


386
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:38.760
我们坚持拿经验说事  也会再掉五个点
We lose by five if we stick with experience.


387
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.470
你觉得她准备好做副总统了吗
You think she's ready to be president?


388
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.540
一月二十号宣誓入职时  应该还不行
I don't think she's gonna be ready on January 20th,


389
00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:51.310
但她够聪明  会准备好的
but I think she has the smarts to get there eventually.


390
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.440
所以你的结论是什么  A.B.
Give me the bottom line, a.B.


391
00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.450
高风险
High risk...


392
00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.580
高回报
High reward.


393
00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:03.920
你不该告诉我
You shouldn't have told me that.


394
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.050
为什么
Why not?


395
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:09.290
我一生都爱冒险
I've been a risk-taker all my life.


396
00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:25.840
-您好  -您好啊
- Hi. - Hi. How are ya?


397
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.310
好极了
Great.


398
00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:28.570
谢谢你能来

399
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.440
感谢你邀请我来你家
Thank you for having me at your beautiful house.


400
00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:34.050
快请进吧
Well, come on in. Please.


401
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.520
萨拉  我最引以为豪的是
One of the things I'm most proud of, Sarah,


402
00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:42.620
我的独立精神
is my independence.


403
00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.460
你在阿拉斯加敢于质疑共和党当权派
And I'm very impressed with how you've bucked


404
00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.890
这点很了不起
the Republican establishment in Alaska.


405
00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.560
在阿拉斯加人们认为我也很独立
Well, I am wired to be kind of independent there also.


406
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.900
我觉得如果要真正代表人民
And I thought if I'm gonna truly run the state


407
00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.200
治理阿拉斯加  那我就得
on behalf of the people, I'm gonna have to do it


408
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.500
摆脱传统政党的束缚
without that good ole boy network.


409
00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.140
你否决了斯蒂夫的绝路桥计划  我很欣赏
I love the way you squashed Stevens' "bridge to nowhere".


410
00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:03.540
我支持阿拉斯加发展经济
Yeah. I am pro-growth


411
00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:05.570
支持基础设施建设
and pro-infrastructure for Alaska,


412
00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.340
但不能以花纳税人的钱为代价
but not at the expense of the American taxpayer.


413
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.380
我在国会上讲过  我们需要建桥
I told congress if we wanted a bridge,


414
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:12.380
但我们会靠自己
we'd build it ourselves.


415
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.880
我们俩很像
You remind me of myself.


416
00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.620
我们都是改革派
We're both reformers who are not afraid


417
00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.190
不怕批评自己党里的一些东西
to thumb our nose at our own party.


418
00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.520
参议员  你是美国英雄
Senator, you're an American hero.


419
00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:24.630
我只是阿拉斯加的萨拉
I'm just Sarah from Alaska.


420
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.100
你们觉得怎样
What do you guys think?


421
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:33.770
我知道像提姆·保兰迪这样的人
I know a guy like Tim Pawlenty


422
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.340
你们不会觉得
isn't exactly the game-changing pick


423
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.840
他是改变规则的人
you all seem to think we need,


424
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.340
但他年轻  精力充沛
but he's young, he's energetic.


425
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.310
而且是坚定的保守派
He has solid conservative credentials.


426
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:44.110
有了保兰迪  基础选民会很高兴
With Pawlenty, we make the base happy.


427
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:46.780
我们也会很清楚能得到什么
And we know what the hell we're getting.


428
00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.520
保兰迪做好了当副总统的准备
Pawlenty's ready to be president.


429
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.150
斯蒂夫  你觉得呢
Steve?


430
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:53.590
佩林还有很多不确定性
Well, there are unknowns with Palin,


431
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:56.860
当然  可能导致不好的结果
and certainly it could go bad.


432
00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:57.900
但我要是你
But if it were me,


433
00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.360
我宁愿冒输掉十个百分点的风险赌一把
I'd rather lose by 10 points


434
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.630
也不愿意因为落后一个点输掉
going for the win than lose by one point


435
00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.160
然后回过头来说  该死
and look back and say, "God damn,"


436
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.900
我们应该拼死一搏的
we should have gone for the win."


437
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:11.170
我们的口号是  国家优先
Our slogan's "Country first."


438
00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.770
利伯曼和保兰迪是体现这一口号的最佳选择
Lieberman and Pawlenty are country-first choices.


439
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:18.010
而人们会认为萨拉·佩林
Sarah Palin will be perceived


440
00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.550
是我们谋私利的政治策略
as a self-serving political maneuver.


441
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.350
约翰  你可能不只输掉选举
You may not only lose the election, John.


442
00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.050
还可能因此而坏了名声
You just might lose your reputation right along with it.


443
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:32.920
我不是为了维护名声参加竞选
I'm not running for my reputation.


444
00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:36.160
我是为了做总统
I'm running to be president.


445
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.000
明白
Yes, sir.


446
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.010
有件事很重要
It is absolutely crucial


447
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.010
不能让任何人知道他的搭档是你
that not a single person know you're the pick.


448
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.710
你的突然出现能够阻止
Surprise of your announcement will stop any momentum


449
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.110
奥巴马通过大会演讲得到更多支持
Obama might get from his convention speech.


450
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.780
很英明
That's smart.


451
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.490
你好像一点都不受这事影响
You seem totally unfazed by all this.


452
00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.990
都是上帝的安排
It's God's plan.


453
00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:24.240
这次选举关键不在我
This election has never been about me.


454
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.510
关键在你们
It's about you.


455
00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.790
你们很清楚  这次选举
You understand that in this election


456
00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:40.350
我们能承担的最大风险是
the greatest risk we can take


457
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:42.220
和一群一成不变的老手
is to try the same old politics


458
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:45.010
进行一场一成不变的政治游戏
with the same old players


459
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:46.660
却期待不一样的结果
and expect a different result.

俄亥俄州代顿市

461

8月29日

462

改变会出现
Change happens.


463
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:56.970
改变会出现  因为美国人需要改变
Change happens because the American people demand it...


464
00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.910
因为人民要求在新的时代要有新的想法
Because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership


465
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.740

我很荣幸能成为你的竞选搭档
Senator, I am honored to be chosen as your running mate.


536
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.280
本周在丹佛  人们都知道
It was rightly noted in Denver this week


537
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:19.520
希拉里在那最高的玻璃天花板上
that Hillary left 18 million cracks


538
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.150
<b>玻璃天花板: 指在工作场所中隐藏的性别歧视
此处引用希拉里的败选演说</b>


539
00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.150
留下了1800万道裂痕
in the highest, hardest glass ceiling in America.


540
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.560
但其实
But it turns out


541
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:30.790
美国的女性不会就此罢手
the women of America aren't finished yet


542
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.930
我们要永久地粉碎这块玻璃
and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all.


543
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.500
得让她准备好大会演讲
We gotta get her ready for her convention speech.


544
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.970
给她安排演讲指导  国外政策专家
She'll need a vocal coach, a foreign policy expert,


545
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.210
发型和化妆顾问以及造型师
hair and make-up consultants and a stylist.


546
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.980
确实
No doubt.


547
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:55.720
*如果我是电影明星*

*我会在豪车后座上*
?I'd sip honey from a pickle jar?


549
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.120
*偷偷抿罐头里的蜂蜜*
? In the back of my limousine?


550
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.690
*大家会把我当偶像*
?And they'd call me an icon?


551
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.960
*我会在人物杂志上*
?And I'd be looking back at you?


552
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.870
*回望你*
?From the cover of a "People" Magazine... ?


553
00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:15.230
不  别太紧了
Not...not too tight.


554
00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:18.840
*应该就是这些*

555
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.810
我喜欢约翰尼·周的鞋子
I love these Johnny Choos.

*相信  我相信*
?And believe it, and I believe it...?


558
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.820
天啊
Oh, my gosh.


559
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:37.250

- The honor is all mine. - Shall we sit?


581
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:24.530
州长  我们的第一项工作是
Well, our first order of business, Governor,


582
00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:27.070
了解一下你还有没有
is we need to find out


583
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.840
我们还不知道的事情
if there are any unexpected surprises.


584
00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:32.040
媒体会对你的过去刨根问底
The press are gonna be digging deep into your past,


585
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:36.240
所以我们要做好回答的准备
so we need to prepare answers about your background.


586
00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.740
天啊
Oh, gosh.


587
00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.510
我想不出还有什么没有公开的
I can't think of anything I haven't already disclosed.


588
00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:44.620
瓦西拉镇的图书管理员声称
The Wasilla librarian claims that as mayor


589
00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.420
她任镇长时试图禁止图书  属实吗
she tried to ban books. Is that true?


590
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.520
关于特里戈并非她亲生的指控是什么情况
What about the allegations that Trig is not really her child?


591
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.960
她是否加入了使用灵言的五旬节教会
Did she attend a pentecostal church where they speak in tongues?


592
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.960
<b>源自1901-1906年间在美国的五旬节运动出现的基督新教教派
强调直接灵感  信奉信仰治疗</b>


593
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.230
我们采访了对佩林作资格审查的相关人士
This source we talked to intimately involved in Palin's vetting


594
00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.260
他们承认除了与
admitted that aside from those they talked to


595
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.070
被卷入所谓"州警门"的人进行了谈话
involved in so-called troopergate,


596
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:01.070
<b>08年佩林曾试图让公共安全专员莫奈甘开除前妹夫伍登的州警职务  
莫奈甘拒绝后被开除</b>


597
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.770
再没跟阿拉斯加的任何品德证人谈过
they didn't talk to any character witnesses in Alaska--


598
00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.270
为什么审查糟成这样
Why was the vet so bad?


599
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.970
坦白说  审查时间太紧
Listen, granted, he only had a few days,


600
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:10.970
不过库尔华豪斯帮她澄清了
but Culvahouse did clear her.


601
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:12.360
拿什么  维基百科吗
Oh, with what? Wikipedia?


602
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.310
资格审查一点都不彻底
There's no way this vet was thorough.


603
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.280
什么  漏了什么
What? What did he miss?


604
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:19.320
他把"州警门"  "绝路桥"都翻出来了
He had troopergate. He had bridge to nowhere.


605
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.820
没人去阿拉斯加采访她的同事和敌人
No one went to Alaska to interview her colleagues, her enemies.


606
00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.090
也没有什么政审
There was no political vet whatsoever.


607
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.260
这些指控都是狗屁
These charges are such bullshit.


608
00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:28.090
特里戈不是她的孩子吗
I mean, Trig isn't her baby?


609
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:30.430
灵言
What, speaking in tongues?


610
00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.560
-她的确说  -我不管
- She does. - I don't care.


611
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.400
宪法第一修正案在这里没用吗
Is the First Amendment no longer law here?


612
00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.400
<b>美国宪法第一修正案指出公民拥有新闻言论自由</b>

613
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:36.730
她无权选择宗教信仰吗
Is she not entitled to her religious beliefs?


614
00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.500
你没抓住重点  里克
You're missing the point, Rick.


615
00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.670
约翰正遭受猛烈抨击  被指选择不负责任
John is getting slammed for making an irresponsible choice.


616
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.670
-我们选中了她  -不  是你们俩选中了她
- We picked her. - No, you two picked her,


617
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.710
拍拍她屁股  把她推出去
then slapped her on the butt and shoved her out there


618
00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.110
站在"国家优先"的横幅下
under a banner saying "Country first!"


619
00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:49.380
你真是个蠢货  马克
You're a real prick, Mark.


620
00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:50.950
-去你的  施密特  -去你的
- Fuck you, Schmidt! - Fuck you!


621
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.720
好了好了  我们把这关过了
All right, all right! Let's just get through this.


622
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.180
来吧
Come on.


623
00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:56.620
州警门  什么
Troopergate. What--?


624
00:30:56.650 --> 00:30:58.250
阿拉斯加州公共安全专员
The Alaska safety commissioner


625
00:30:58.290 --> 00:31:00.920
声称自己被撤职是因为没有开除
is claiming that he was fired because he wouldn't fire


626
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.590
佩林的妹夫  州警迈克·伍登
Palin's brother-in-law, trooper Mike Wooten.


627
00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:06.890
对州警伍登的指控是什么
And what were the charges against trooper Wooten?


628
00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.100
除了他跟佩林妹妹离婚的事实吗
Besides the fact that he was divorcing Palin's sister?


629
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:13.070
对  我们有没有资料显示
Yes. Do we have any information that shows


630
00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.270
州警伍登应该被开除
trooper Wooten should have been fired?


631
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.470
有  伍登被指控
Yeah, Wooten was accused of drinking


632
00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.240
执勤时在警车内饮酒
from an open container from his police car,


633
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.340
用泰瑟枪电击11岁继子
tasering his 11-year-old stepson,


634
00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:23.610
还有非法射杀驼鹿
and illegally shooting a moose without a permit.


635
00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.110
天哪
Jesus Christ.


636
00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:28.080
让阿拉斯加议会统一口径
Okay, coordinate all responses with their Alaskan council.


637
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.180
要把这事控制在当地
Let's try to keep it a local matter.


638
00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.590
绝路桥  这个我们应该很拿手
Bridge to nowhere. I thought we were good on this.


639
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.250
她当选后压下了这个项目
She had the project squashed after she was elected,


640
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.860
但她是靠支持建桥当选的
but ran on a platform to build the bridge.


641
00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.360
大变脸[指改变政治立场]
It's a huge flip-flop.


642
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:40.860
该死的
God damn it.


643
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:43.460
她为什么没告诉我们
How could she not tell us that?


644
00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.400
阿拉斯加独立党又他妈是什么东西
What the fuck is the Alaska Independence Party


645
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.930
她是党内成员吗
and was she ever a member of it?


646
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.500
阿拉斯加独立党是个政党  唯一党纲是
The A.I.P. Is a political party whose sole platform


647
00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:54.140
阿拉斯加脱离联邦
is the secession of Alaska from the union.


648
00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:55.610
挺有趣的啊
Well, ain't that a hoot?


649
00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.480
她是党内成员吗
Now, was she ever a member of it?


650
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.350
是吗
Well?


651
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.380
我们知道托德·佩林多年来都是党内成员
We know Todd Palin was a member for many years.


652
00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:08.250
我们无法确定她是不是
We can't confirm if she was ever a member.


653
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:11.760
好的  现在就联系你在阿拉斯加的人
Okay. Call our people in Alaska right now


654
00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.320
查出她是不是
and find out if she was.


655
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:15.630
现在阿拉斯加是凌晨3点

656
00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.990
半夜连电话都不会响吗
The phones don't work there at night?!


657
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.800
我们正遭受攻击  朋友们
We're under attack here, people!


658
00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.570
你们得加把劲
You're gonna have to raise your game.


659
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.110
我敢保证奥巴马的人
I can assure you that Obama's people


660
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.510
全扑在这些事上
are all over this shit.


661
00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:33.410
在过去的24小时内  我被国内媒体
In the last 24 hours, I have been asked questions


662
00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.110
问了许多蛮横  恶心的问题
by the national media that are outrageous and disgusting.


663
00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:40.020
有人问我  她上次生产时
I have been asked when her amniotic fluid


664
00:32:40.050 --> 00:32:42.780
羊水是什么时候破的
started to leak with regard to her last birth.


665
00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.220
太无耻了
It's shameful.


666
00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:45.890
那是什么时候破的
So when did it start leaking?


667
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.690
她与石油公司对抗
She's fought the oil companies.


668
00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.120
与腐败的特殊利益集团较量
She's taken on corrupt special interests.


669
00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.690
这些指控完全是性别歧视
These accusations are totally sexist.


670
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.330
我这辈子没见过哪位候选人
Never in my life have I seen a candidate


671
00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.800
被自由派媒体攻击成这样
more attacked by the liberal media.


672
00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.370
诽谤一个接一个
Smear after smear after smear.


673
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.000
确定我们要这么做吗
Are you sure we have to do this?


674
00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.600
我告诉布里斯托时  她哭个不停
Bristol couldn't stop crying when I told her.


675
00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.170
这个明天就会见报
It's going to have come out tomorrow


676
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:07.670
不管我们发不发声明  州长
with or without our statement, Governor.


677
00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:09.110
积极的一面是
A positive from this


678
00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.980
考虑到布里斯托的孕期
is that given the timing of Bristol's pregnancy,


679
00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.950
特里戈不可能是她的孩子
it makes it physically impossible for Trig to be her baby.


680
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:17.950
我们就能平息那个荒谬的谣言
So we can put that absurd rumor to rest.


681
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.690
我们为布里斯托生孩子的决定而感到骄傲
"We're proud of Bristol's decision to have her baby


682
00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.690
更为能成为祖父母而感到骄傲
and even prouder to become grandparents."


683
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.160
未成年的女儿怀孕了
We're not proud


684
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.030
我们才不会感到骄傲  玛丽亚
that our teenage daughter is pregnant, Maria.


685
00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.360
我也不想让人们觉得
And I don't want to send a message that teen pregnancy


686
00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.500
青少年怀孕是值得骄傲的事
is something to be proud of.


687
00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:34.300
我想把这句去掉
I want that line out.


688
00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.730
好的  州长  我现在就改
Of course, Governor. I'll change it right away.


689
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:40.740
在竞选现场我们看到
Governor Palin's 17-year-old daughter Bristol


690
00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:43.840
佩林州长17岁的女儿布里斯托抱着弟弟特里戈
has been seen holding her baby brother Trig at campaign events.


691
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.940
美国人民今天才知道
What the American people didn't know until today


692
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.710
布里斯托已有了五个月的身孕
is that Bristol is five months pregnant.


693
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.380
她的父母发表了如下声明
Her parents issued this statement:


694
00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:52.880
我们为布里斯托生孩子的决定而感到骄傲
"We're proud of Bristol's decision to have her baby."


695
00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:54.720
我明明说了把这句去掉
I specifically wanted that line taken out,


696
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:56.350
你却一字不差地放出来
and you ran it without changing a word.


697
00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:57.620
你说得对
You're absolutely right.


698
00:33:57.660 --> 00:33:59.920
竞选团队对此全权负责
The campaign takes full responsibility on this.


699
00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.860
玛丽亚将当面向你道歉
Maria's gonna personally apologize to you.


700
00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:03.530
怎么会这么冒失
How the flip did this happen?


701
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.160
麦凯恩参议员有时候
Senator McCain is somewhat


702
00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.500
会意气用事
a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants type of guy,


703
00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.100
所以有时竞选团队会有点混乱
and it does occasionally create a little chaos in the campaign.


704
00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:11.930
我希望玛丽亚辞职
Well, I want Maria gone.


705
00:34:11.970 --> 00:34:14.800
州长  这是失误  玛丽亚很难过
Governor, this was a mistake. Maria feels terrible.


706
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.440
她是名优秀的新闻发言人
She's an excellent press secretary.


707
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:19.340
我17岁的女儿正被
My 17-year-old daughter is being made fun of


708
00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.040
国内每个脱口秀主持取笑
by every talk show host in the country.


709
00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.150
我要玛丽亚辞职
I want Maria gone, period.


710
00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:27.350
好的  州长  她不会再来了
Of course, Governor. She's gone.


711
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.520
好了
Done.


712
00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:33.160
谁去打这通电话
Who makes that call?


713
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.490
你
That'd be you.


714
00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:38.490
如果约翰·麦凯恩这位72岁高龄
The idea that if something happened to John McCain


715
00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:42.000
并得过两次黑素瘤的候选人意外去世
who is 72 years old and who has had two bouts with melanoma,


716
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.130
接任总统的将会是她
and she could step into the presidency--


717
00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:45.630
太荒谬了
It's just ridiculous.


718
00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.130
事情的真相是  瑞秋
The real sequence, Rachel,


719
00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.800
她起初赞成造桥
is she said "Please" and "Thank you,"


720
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.340
上台后国会刚一取消造桥计划
and then "Thanks, but no thanks,"


721
00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:56.910
她就也随声附和说不要造桥
only when the Congress had de-authorized the bridge...


722
00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:59.410
你好  州长  我就过来报个到
Hi, Governor. I just wanted to check in,


723
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:01.980
确保你还好
make sure you're doing okay.


724
00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.120
约翰·麦凯恩是否应该考虑换掉萨拉·佩林
Should John McCain consider replacing Sarah Palin


725
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:05.950
作为共和党候选人
on the GOP ticket?


726
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:07.450
我想跟媒体谈谈
I want to talk to the press.


727
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:10.160
我要澄清这件事
I want to set the record straight on this stuff.


728
00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.090
我去帮特里戈穿睡衣
I'll just go put Trig's PJ's on.


729
00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:18.360
-好了  宝贝  -帮你穿睡衣
- There you go, baby. - Just gonna put your PJ's on.


730
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.230
我们不希望你跟任何人谈
Now, we don't want you to talk to anyone


731
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:24.700
直到共和党大会结束
until after the convention


732
00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.210
因为没人了解你
because no one knows anything about you.


733
00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.870
如果你回应了这些荒谬的指控
If you answer these ridiculous allegations,


734
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:35.150
就是把自己定义为辩护立场
you'll be defining yourself in a defensive posture.


735
00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.910
媒体不正在这样定义我的吗
But isn't the press defining me right now?


736
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:40.990
没有哪个新闻报道能延续48小时以上的
No news story lasts more than 48 hours any more.


737
00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.320
新闻不被人铭记
News is no longer meant to be remembered.


738
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.750
而是仅供娱乐
It's just entertainment.


739
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.860
如果你能在共和党大会上表现出色
So if you hit your convention speech out of the park,


740
00:35:47.890 --> 00:35:52.860
下一波新闻就是萨拉·佩林的回归
the next news cycle will be the comeback of Sarah Palin.


741
00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.830
我能做好
Yeah. I can do that.


742
00:35:55.870 --> 00:35:59.440
每个人都听说了你的疯狂故事
Now, everyone's heard a lot of crazy stories about you.


743
00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.770
现在是时候由你告诉世界  真实的自己
Now it's time for you to tell the world who you really are.


744
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:07.610
告诉麦凯恩参议员  我不会令他失望
You tell Senator McCain I won't let him down.


745
00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.880
晚上好  这里是圣保罗的共和党选举人代表大会
And good evening from the G.O.P. Convention in St. Paul.


746
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.880
所有目光都将聚焦在麦凯恩参议员的
All eyes will be on Senator McCain's


747
00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:15.180
副总统人选  萨拉·佩林
V.P. choice, Governor Sarah Palin,


748
00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:17.220
在本次大会上的登台演讲
when she takes the stage at the R.N.C.


749
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.220
她很可能从未见过如此
She's likely never seen a night


750
00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.160
充满预期
fraught with so much anticipation,


751
00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.290
期待和压力的夜晚
expectation and pressure.


752
00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.790
共和党全国代表大会

753
00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:24.790
9月3日

754
00:36:24.830 --> 00:36:27.860
食物很糟  但我听说伊拉克的更糟
The food's terrible, but I hear it's gonna be worse in Iraq.


755
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.800
-我儿子真勇敢  -加油  妈妈
- My boy's so brave. - Come on, mom.


756
00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.070
谢谢你邀请我  佩林女士
Thank you for inviting me, Mrs. Palin.


757
00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.240
谢谢你剪了头发  莱威
Thank you for cutting your mullet, Levi.


758
00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:42.010
非常感谢
I really appreciate it.


759
00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.680
一开始不想剪的
I didn't really want to at first,


760
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.610
但我觉得现在看上去好多了
but I think it looks way better now.


761
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:50.020
我也这么觉得
I think it does, too.


762
00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.390
抱歉打断一下
Sorry to interrupt,


763
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.090
佩林一家该就座了
but the Palins need to go to their seats.


764
00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:58.160
-再见  妈妈  -好
- Bye, mom. - Okay.


765
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.500
我不知道  不知道
I don't know. I don't know.


766
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.540
她没问题的
Hey, she's gonna be fine.


767
00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:14.370
-真的吗  -绝对
- Really? - Absolutely.


768
00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.780
她没问题吧
Is she gonna be okay?


769
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:20.540
我更担心一对一辩论
I'm more concerned about one on ones.


770
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.010
多糟
How bad?


771
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:25.250
我不确定她对外交政策了解多少
I'm not sure how much she knows about foreign policy.


772
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:27.850
她不知道为什么南北朝鲜是两个国家
She didn't know why North and South Korea were different countries.


773
00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.490
好吧  我们别让媒体靠近她
Okay, let's keep the press away from her.


774
00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.690
我们还有五天时间让她熟悉形势
We have five days to bring her up to speed.


775
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:36.160
她没问题的
She'll be fine.


776
00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.190
她五分钟后上台  我去准备一下
She's on in five minutes. I've gotta get up there.


777
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:39.830
好运
Good luck.


778
00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.060
选择萨拉·佩林州长
In choosing Governor Sarah Palin


779
00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.020
作为竞选伙伴
as his running mate,


780
00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:47.970
约翰·麦凯恩为将来做了选择
John McCain has chosen for the future.


781
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:52.740
佩林州长代表着新一代
Governor Palin represents a new generation.


782
00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:55.640
她已然是美国最成功的州长之一
She's already one of the most successful governors


783
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.210
而且是最受欢迎的
in America and the most popular.


784
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:06.050
让我们选择约翰·麦凯恩和萨拉·佩林
Let's get John McCain and Sarah Palin elected,


785
00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:08.390
震撼华盛顿
and let's shake up Washington


786
00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:11.390
推动这个国家前进
and move this country forward!


787
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:15.530
你能行
You're gonna do great.


788
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:19.830
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,


789
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.900
阿拉斯加州长
the Governor of Alaska


790
00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:26.210
美利坚合众国下一任副总统
and the next Vice President of the United States,


791
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.380
萨拉·佩林

792
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.390
谢谢
Thank you.


793
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:52.100
主席先生  各位代表
Mr. Chairman, delegates,


794
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.730

我很荣幸被提名为
I will be honored to accept your nomination


796
00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.340
美利坚合众国的副总统
for Vce President of the United States.


797

814
00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.170
在我成为伟大的

阿拉斯加州州长时

我是自己家乡的镇长
I was mayor of my hometown.


817
00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.450
我想一个小镇的镇长
I guess a small-town mayor


818
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:29.990
类似于社区组织者
is sort of like a community organizer.


819
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:35.060
<b>讽刺奥巴马没有经验  只当过社区组织者</b>

820
00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:35.060
但是有具体的责任
Except that you have actual responsibilities.


821

你们知道
You know they say the difference


824
00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:49.070
冰球妈妈和斗牛犬的区别是什么吗
between a hockey mom and a pit bull?


825
00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.570
前者擦口红
Lipstick.


826
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:54.280
她刚刚这句是临场发挥
She just came up with that.


827
00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.450
加入我们  帮助美国

-干得好  -不能更好了

她没有用提词器

835
00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.570
演讲到一半就坏了
It broke halfway through her speech.


836

-开玩笑的吧  -没有

854

直到看到你的演讲
before we saw you give that speech.


855
00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.130
谢谢  太感谢了
Oh, thank you. Thanks so much.


856
00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:28.530
看看你  我想看我儿子特里戈
Look at you. I want to look at how handsome


857
00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.140
长大成人后能有多帅
my son Trig's gonna be when he's all grown up.


858
00:42:31.170 --> 00:42:34.040
她知道不能靠政府解决问题
She understands that you can't solve problems with government,


859
00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.710
政府才是问题
that government is the problem.


860
00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:38.880
她讲到自己的信仰时  看得出是认真的
When she talks about her faith, you can tell it's for real.


861
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:42.010
她讲到枪支问题时  看得出是认真的
When she talks about guns, you can tell it's for real.


862
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:43.750
我也有五个孩子
I've got five kids, too,


863
00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.280
她还有一种特质
and there's something about her--


864
00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:48.650
她真心跟我说话  没人愿意跟我说话
she's talking to me. And nobody talks to me.


865
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.360
CNN民调显示  我们跟奥巴马打平了
CNN has us even with Obama.


866
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.290
-开玩笑吗  -盖乐普民调  我们上升了五个点
- Are you kidding me? - Hey, Gallup has us up by five.


867
00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:59.030
她帮我们得到的正是我们需要的
She's given us exactly what we needed.


868
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:00.930
前几天我们得到了更多资金
We've made more money in the last few days


869
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.360
这几天拿到的资金都超过上月合计了
than we did all last month.


870
00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.470
我一辈子都没见过这么热情的选民
I've never seen crowds like this in my life.

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.540
-民众喜爱她  -她比奥巴马更耀眼
- They love her. - She's a bigger star than Obama.


872
00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.970
我们这下赢定了
We can really win this thing.


873
00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.110
我能理解你们的心情
I really understand your frustr--


874
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:19.950
抱歉  诸位  今天没有采访安排
I'm sorry, pool. It's not gonna happen today.


875
00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.520
抱歉
Sorry.


876
00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:23.650
-只要五分钟  -别小瞧媒体
- Five minutes! - Views matter.


877
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:26.450
你知道托德·佩林是爱斯基摩人吗
Did you know that Todd Palin is an Eskimo?


878
00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:28.960
是吗  斯蒂夫  挺有意思
Oh, yeah, Steve? That's really interesting.


879
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:31.890
真的  他是尤皮克支爱斯基摩人
Seriously, he's a Yupik Eskimo.


880
00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:34.170
如果我们不尽快安排她与媒体接触  
We're gonna take some serious blowback from the press


881
00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:35.500
记者的意见会越来越大
if we don't let them speak to her soon.


882
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.930
-他们真会抓狂的  -我知道
- They're really getting pissed. - I know, yeah.


883
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:40.000
我不知道她会如何应对
Well, I don't know how ready she is.


884
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.500
尼科尔  你多虑了
Nicolle, you worry too much.


885
00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.940
大家都知道她对外交政策缺乏了解
We always knew she'd be weak on foreign policy.


886
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.510
我们会尽快帮她搞定
We'll get her up to speed.


887
00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:49.280
斯蒂夫  我觉得除了外交政策
Steve, I don't think foreign policy


888
00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.480
还存在其他问题
is her only weakness.


889
00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.770
抱歉  打扰你一下  
Sorry to bother you, Governor.


890
00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:55.920
州长  现在方便谈谈吗
Is now a okay time to talk?


891
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.550
<b>福音战士: 致力于为他人祈祷的基督教徒</b>

892
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:58.550
可以  我刚刚在读福音战士发来的邮件
Sure, I'm just reading the e-mails from the Prayer Warriors.


893
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:00.450
他们真有意思
These guys are awesome.


894
00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:02.890
我想告诉你
I just want to take a moment to inform you


895
00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.860
麦凯恩对你那天的表现非常满意
of how thrilled Senator McCain is.


896
00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:08.850
你所做的一切 
You're exceeding his wildest expectation


897
00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:10.330
完全超出他先前的预期
for what a running mate could achieve.


898
00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.430
很高兴听他这么说
I am so happy to hear that.


899
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:15.100
从政以来  我还是第一次
These are the largest crowds I've ever seen


900
00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.070
见到这般热情的民众
in my entire political career, ever.


901
00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.640
真的吗  我就是
Really? Yeah, I just--


902
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:21.170
喜欢跟人们聊天
I just love talking to people on the rope lines,


903
00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:22.740
倾听他们的困难
getting to hear their problems.


904
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:25.140
我真的很感动
It's-- it's really moving to me.


905
00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.980
人们也能体会到
Well, you know, that comes across.


906
00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:29.350
州长  你帮我们力挽狂澜
You're a transformative figure, Governor.


907
00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:32.820
你完全可以成为里根第二
You-- you could be the party's next Ronald Reagan.


908
00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.320
上帝  我
Holy jeez, I--


909
00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:38.320
其实  他是我的偶像  所以
yeah, he's-- he's my hero, so...


910
00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.260
他也是我的偶像
Mine, too. So, uh...


911
00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:44.660
接下来  我们将会安排你接受一些采访
The next step is just-- we're gonna start doing some interviews.


912
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.760
太好了  我迫不及待想跟媒体交流
Great. I've been dying to talk to the press.


913
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.270
而且  我觉得可以帮到你们
Also, I feel like I could really help you there.


914
00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.700
在阿拉斯加  我对媒体一直持有开放态度
I've always been very, very open with the press in Alaska.


915
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:54.870
我们没让你接受采访有我们的考虑
The reasoning behind holding you back


916
00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:57.510
整个媒体界一致倒向奥巴马阵营
is the entire press corps is in the tank for Obama,


917
00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.310
他们只想用尖锐的问题令你出洋相
so all they want in life is to trip you up with obscure questions.


918
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:03.210
-刁难问题  -刁难问题
- Gotcha questions. - Gotcha questions.


919
00:45:03.250 --> 00:45:05.910
所以我们希望等你准备充分一切就绪后
So we just want to make sure you're fully prepped


920
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:06.850
再跟他们见面
before we unleash them.


921
00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:08.850
会有阿拉斯加的报纸采访吗
What about the local Alaska papers?


922
00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:10.750
没有地方报刊
There are no local papers any more.


923
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:14.120
你的言语将即时出现在国家媒体上
Anything you say goes national the instant you say it.


924
00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.320
我懂了
Yeah, got it.


925
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.920
我觉得最好的准备方式
Okay, so I think the best way to prep would


926
00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:20.700
就是先过一遍样题
just be to go through some sample questions.


927
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:22.200
行  开始吧
Sure, let's do it.


928
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:25.130
那我们先从简单的入手
Um, let's start with something simple.


929
00:45:25.170 --> 00:45:29.380
面对英国国内强烈的反伊战呼声 
Uh... how do you plan on maintaining our alliance with Great Britain on Iraq,


930
00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:34.640
如何维系与英国的联盟关系
even though support for the war there is at an all-time low?


931
00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:40.750
我觉得美国与女王一直保持着密切的关系
I think the United States has always maintained a great relationship with the Queen.


932
00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:45.620
约翰·麦凯恩将继续与她进行公开对话
And John McCain will continue to have an open dialogue with her.


933
00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:47.890
州长
Uh, Governor,


934
00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.920
女王不是英国政府首脑
the Queen is not the head of government in England.


935
00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.430
她是国家元首
She's the head of state.


936
00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:55.030
那谁是政府首脑
Well, then, who's the head of government?


937
00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:58.230
首相
The Prime Minister.


938
00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:16.300
兰迪·舒尼曼
斯蒂夫·拜根
外交政策顾问


939
00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:21.450
随传随到
You rang?


940
00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:23.820
真是及时雨
The cavalry has arrived.


941
00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.160
-感谢二位光临  请进  -你猜对了
- Thank you, gentlemen. Come on in. - You bet.


942
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:27.790
好
Yeah.


943
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:37.730
我
Well, I, uh--


944
00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:39.670
我认为我们可以先给州长
I think we should start by prepping the Governor


945
00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.900
介绍俄罗斯的经济政策
with Russian economic policy


946
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:46.280
跟普京上台前美苏"后冷战时代"有联系
as it relates to post-cold war tensions during the pre-Putin era.


947
00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:49.650
我觉得我们可以更简单一点
I was thinking something a little bit simpler.


948
00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:50.880
要多简单
How much simpler?


949
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:53.320
这里是德国
This is Germany.


950
00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:58.050
是一战与二战的主要同盟国
They were the primary antagonists during World War I and World War II.


951
00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:00.650
第二次世界大战间  
And in World War II,


952
00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.760
它与日本  意大利结为轴心国阵营
they were aligned with Japan and Italy to form what was known as the Axis.


953
00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:12.400
现今我们正处于"三场战争"
Currently, we're in the middle of what I like to call "the three wars".


954
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:16.910
阿富汗战争  伊拉克战争  全球反恐战争
That's Afghanistan, Iraq, and the global war on terror.


955
00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:20.540
州长  需要休息一下吗
Governor, would you-- would you like to take a break?


956
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:23.980
别  蛮有意思的
No way. This is flippin' awesome.


957
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:31.050
就阿富汗而言  9/11事件后
Now, with Afghanistan, after 9/11...


958
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:34.020
已为其家庭建起一道保护墙  
... already put a protective wall up around the family,


959
00:47:34.020 --> 00:47:36.120
对个别成员的保密尤甚
especially the key players.


960
00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:39.560
萨拉·佩林的女儿布莉丝托如今已有身孕
Look at Bristol, Sarah Palin's daughter, who is pregnant.


961
00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:40.730
我们见过她  
We've seen her,


962
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:42.360
和她男友莱威  
we've seen her boyfriend Levi,


963
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.660
也就是孩子的父亲
the father of her child,


964
00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:45.420
但我们还未能向当事人求证
but we haven't really gotten to talk to them


965
00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:46.860
是谁最先提出结婚 
about whose idea it was to get married


966
00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:47.530
另外  
and why, for example,


967
00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:51.590
为什么莱威在个人空间说不想要小孩
Levi on his MySpace page - says he doesn't want kids...


968
00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:52.940
这不是什么
That isn't anybody's--


969
00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:56.340
他们为什么不让我静一静
Why won't they just leave me alone?


970
00:47:56.380 --> 00:47:59.780
我受够了
I'm so tired of it.


971
00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:04.220
欺负小女孩的人都不是什么好东西
Any grownup who makes fun of a teenage girl is a terrible person.


972
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:06.350
宝贝  忘记她说的话  好吗
And we'll forget what she said, honey, okay?


973
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:07.950
好吗
Okay?


974
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.490
我的邮箱被黑了
My e-mails were hacked.


975
00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.830
我了解  州长  
I know, Governor,


976
00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:13.060
我们正努力维护  我向你保证
and we're on it. I promise you.


977
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.510
你知不知道我女儿的手机号
Did you know that my daughter's cell phone


978
00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:16.760
在网上被曝光  她常接到骚扰电话
is online and she's getting crank calls?


979
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:21.070
你知不知道我的家人正遭受威胁
Did you know that my family is being threatened?


980
00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:24.670
州长  你有权生气  我很抱歉
Governor, you have every right to be upset, and I am sorry.


981
00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.140
我已经跟特勤局取得联系
I've already contacted Secret Service


982
00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:28.970
他们表示会加强防护
and they're gonna increase security.


983
00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:29.630
你能不能  
Can you--


984
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:31.710
能否麻烦你保护我的邮件  斯蒂夫
can you protect my e-mails, Steve?


985
00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:36.650
你  或者竞选至少保证这一点
Can you-- can this campaign at least do that?


986
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:44.290
查理·吉布森很专业
Charlie Gibson is good,


987
00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.920
他必定会提一些比较有深度的问题
so I'm sure the questions will have some depth.


988
00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.950
像能源这种你擅长的话题  
Don't be afraid to elaborate if it's a subject you feel comfortable with,


989
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:51.330
可以展开论述
like energy.


990
00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.360
你没事吧  州长
Are you okay, Governor?


991
00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.500
为什么我们在阿拉斯加没动静
Why aren't there any McCain-Palin lawn signs in Alaska?


992
00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:02.370
因为奥巴马先生
Well, Mr. Obama


993
00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.440
手上的竞选经费是我们的5倍
has five times the money we have.


994
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:07.240
5倍呀  另外
Five times, and...


995
00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.330
阿拉斯加只有3票  
Alaska is only three electoral votes,


996
00:49:09.330 --> 00:49:11.210
完全在共和党的掌控之中
and it's solid red.


997
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:13.310
我不知道家乡民众会不会把票投给我
I'm concerned about my standing back home.


998
00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:14.810
托德跟我都听到一些传言
Todd and I are hearing things,


999
00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.050
而我又没法与阿拉斯加媒体交流
and I can't talk to the Alaskan press.


1000
00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:18.550
你听到什么传言
What are you hearing?


1001
00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:20.620
谣言  反正没好话
Things. None of it's good.


1002
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:24.020
你能调查一下我的民众支持率吗
Can you at least do a poll to check my approval rating there?


1003
00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.960
州长  一次民调要花6万美元经费
Governor, that would cost the campaign $60,000.


1004
00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.030
知道我目前的支持率
I'd feel a heck of a lot better


1005
00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:31.360
能让我好受不少
if I knew where I was at.


1006
00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:35.800
那好  为了让你舒心
Absolutely. We will do the poll


1007
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.740
我们会做这次民调  仅此一次
for your peace of mind, just this once.


1008
00:49:37.770 --> 00:49:39.270
很好  谢谢
Great. Thank you.


1009
00:49:39.310 --> 00:49:41.610
现在可以继续准备查理·吉布森的问题吗
So, can we get back to prepping Charlie Gibson?


1010
00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:43.110
当然  我没问题  开始吧
Sure, I'm ready. Let's do it.


1011
00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:45.810
-准备好了吗  -准备好了
- You ready? - Yes.


1012
00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:48.410
你认为美联储
Do you think the Fed


1013
00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:51.380
对贝尔斯登破产处理正确吗[08年金融危机]
did the right thing in their dealing with the Bear Stearns collapse?


1014
00:49:52.890 --> 00:49:55.220
经济形势日益严峻  
Our economy is hurting,


1015
00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:57.090
而联邦政府却无力
and the federal government has not


1016
00:49:57.090 --> 00:50:00.830
为国家提供一个健全完备的监督体系
provided the sound oversight that we need and that we deserve.


1017
00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:05.370
我认为我们需要将瓦西拉的民生
I think we need a little bit of reality from Wasilla Main Street


1018
00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:07.940
传达给华盛顿  
there brought to Washington, D.C.,


1019
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:11.050
让人民了解
so that the people there can understand


1020
00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:16.640
工薪家庭如何看待联邦政府的官僚主义
how the average working-class family is viewing bureaucracy in the federal government.


1021
00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:18.710
州长
Governor...


1022
00:50:18.740 --> 00:50:20.380
你知道美联储是什么吗
Do you know what the Fed is?


1023
00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:24.150
你指哪方面  查理
In what respect, Charlie?


1024
00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.550
不  这次是我本人提问
No, no. This is me, Steve,


1025
00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:28.950
你知道美联储是什么吗
asking do you know what the Fed is?


1026
00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.890
国家联邦储备系统
Stands for the Federal Reserve System.


1027
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:41.400
请别急着记  先听我讲
No, please. Don't write, just listen.


1028
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:46.270
美联储负责我国货币政策
The Fed is responsible for all monetary policy in the United States.


1029
00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:48.140
任何涉及美联储或贝尔斯登的问题
On any Fed or Bear Stearns question,


1030
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:52.470
只需回答美联储采取了及时有效的救助措施
just say the Fed took the appropriate action that was needed at the time.


1031
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:54.080
好吗
Okay?


1032
00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:58.410
知道了
Got it.


1033
00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.250
你长子将于下周随军入驻伊拉克
Your oldest son is proudly heading off to Iraq next week.


1034
00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:07.250
此刻谁是你的首要敌人
Who do you see as the primary enemy at this point?


1035
00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:10.460
激进的伊斯兰极端分子
Radical Islamist extremists.


1036
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:12.090
你能具体说明吗
Can you be more specific?


1037
00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:16.500
那些决意摧毁我们国家的恐怖分子
The terrorists who are hell-bent on destroying our nation.


1038
00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:18.300
州长  你知道为何在伊拉克驻兵吗
Governor, do you know why we're in Iraq?


1039
00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:19.860
因为萨达姆·侯赛因
Because Saddam Hussein


1040
00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:22.400
在9月11日对我们进行恐怖袭击
attacked us on 9/11.


1041
00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.900
不是  不
No. No, uh,


1042
00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:27.070
911的肇事者是"基地"组织
Al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11.


1043
00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:28.610
不是萨达姆·侯赛因
Not Saddam Hussein.


1044
00:51:28.640 --> 00:51:30.270
是"基地"组织干的
No, it was Al-Qaeda.


1045
00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:32.640
所以我们才派兵驻扎阿富汗
And that's why we're in Afghanistan.


1046
00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.260
你知道阿富汗战争
Do you know the primary differences between the war in Afghanistan


1047
00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:37.020
与伊拉克战争最大的区别在哪吗
and the war in Iraq?


1048
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:44.690
失陪一下
Um, excuse us for a moment.


1049
00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.000
能为我再准备一点阿富汗方面的资料吗
Can I get some more information about Afghanistan?


1050
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:56.930
当然  州长
Of course, Governor.


1051
00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:09.080
-要不取消采访吧  -不行
- Should we cancel? - We can't.


1052
00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:11.180
福克斯都开始对我们施压
Even Fox is pounding us for hiding her.


1053
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:13.720
-取消就死定了  -你们面试她的时候
- We'd get murdered. - When you interviewed her,


1054
00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:15.780
都没问过国家安全问题吗
didn't you ask her about national security?


1055
00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.990
外交政策  国内政策 
Foreign policy, domeicic policy?


1056
00:52:19.020 --> 00:52:20.820
我以为库尔华豪斯会问
I thought Culvahouse would cover that.


1057
00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.660
那你们都问了她什么
So what did you ask her?


1058
00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:24.130
我只是  我们问她
I just-- we talked about


1059
00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:26.520
她是否愿意全力支持约翰  
if she would back John's positions


1060
00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.230
就算约翰的某些立场与她的相冲突
when they conflicted with hers


1061
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:31.600
还有  她是否做好改变人生的准备
or if she was prepared for her life to change.


1062
00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.130
没问政策问题
There were no policy questions.


1063
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:37.870
你们没细问是因为你们想让她通过
You guys didn't grill her because you wanted it to work.


1064
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:40.740
我不负责审查  妮可
I wasn't in charge of the vet, Nicolle.


1065
00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:47.980
她演技超棒  对吗
She's a great actress, right?


1066
00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.320
绝对一流
Oh, the best.


1067
00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:53.150
干嘛不直接替她准备一些台词呢
Why don't we just give her some lines?


1068
00:52:59.330 --> 00:53:02.860
这些是我认为查理最可能提出的问题
I've come up with a list of questions that I think Charlie's most likely to ask.


1069
00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:04.300
只要你把回答记下
If you memorize these answers,


1070
00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:06.030
我保证你可以顺利过关
I'm sure you're going to nail this interview.


1071
00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:07.570
你怎么知道他会问这些
How do you know he'll ask these?


1072
00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.030
我曾任白宫新闻主任
I was the White House communications director.


1073
00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:11.340
我的工作就是预测问题
It's my job to figure out the questions.


1074
00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:12.740
萨斯卡什维利
"Shushkashvili."


1075
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.140
萨卡什维利  格鲁吉亚总统
Saakashvili, the President of Georgia.


1076
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:16.880
萨斯卡什维利
Shashkashvili.


1077
00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:18.980
萨卡什维利
Saakashvith--


1078
00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:21.650
-萨卡什维利  -萨卡什-维利
- Saakashvili. - Saakash-vili.


1079
00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.880
我想就国家安全状况提几个具体问题
Let me ask you about some specific national security situations.


1080
00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:25.280
好的
Sure.


1081
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.120
首先是关于俄罗斯与格鲁吉亚
Let's start with Russia and Georgia.


1082
00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:29.410
你认为美国应该维护
Do you believe the United States should try to restore


1083
00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:33.930
格鲁吉亚在南奥赛梯与阿伯卡茨的主权吗
Georgian sovereignty over South Ossetia and Abkhazia?


1084
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:35.430
首先  我们仍将继续
First off, we're gonna continue


1085
00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:36.890
与萨卡什维利保持良好关系
good relations with Saakashvili there.


1086
00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:39.500
我前几天刚与他通过话
I was able to speak with him the other day,


1087
00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:41.730
我们应该同时密切关注俄罗斯的动向
and we've gotta keep an eye on Russia.


1088
00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:43.150
俄罗斯
For Russia


1089
00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:46.030
无故对一个弱小民主国家  
to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading


1090
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.910
发起进攻
a smaller Democratic country unprovoked


1091
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:49.300
实在是无法接受  而且我们
is unacceptable, and we have...


1092
00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:51.110
你认为俄方是无故吗
You believe unprovoked?


1093
00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:53.540
-对  -我相信俄方无故
- Yes. - I do, I do believe unprovoked.


1094
00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:55.240
我们必须对俄罗斯提高警惕
And we have to keep our eye on Russia...


1095
00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.650
镁光灯一开她就进入状态
She's a red-light performer.


1096
00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.710
关注领导层的意向
...under the leadership there.


1097
00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:00.420
你如何解读
What insight


1098
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:05.130
俄罗斯近期  特别是近两周的动作  
into Russian actions, particularly in the last couple of weeks,


1099
00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:06.120
阿拉斯加的地理位置是否让你有不同看法
does the proximity of this state give you?


1100
00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.860
它是我们的邻居
They're our next-door neighbors.


1101
00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:11.460
站在阿拉斯加你可以直接望见俄罗斯
And you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska.


1102
00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:14.000
你认为伊朗核问题
Do you consider a nuclear Iran...


1103
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:16.330
-该死  -对以色列构成严重威胁吗
- Damn it. - ...to be an existential threat to Israel?


1104
00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:18.700
从我家就可以看到俄罗斯
And I can see Russia from my house.


1105
00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:30.810
我相信温室效应由人类活动所致
I believe global warming is caused by man.


1106
00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:34.250
我相信只是因为上帝想把我们搂紧一点
And I believe it's just God hugging us closer.


1107
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:39.690
我不同意布什主义
I don't agree with the Bush Doctrine.


1108
00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:39.690
<b>布什政府在国家安全政策和对外交往中
遵循"美国利益至上"和"以实力求和平"两大原则</b>


1109
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:41.690
我不知道那是什么玩意
And I don't know what that is.


1110
00:54:44.330 --> 00:54:46.190
她开始还没意识到
She initially did not understand this,


1111
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:48.560
而我也觉得人们能自己作出判断
and I think that people can make what they want of it,


1112
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.350
但我或其他人可以确信
but was I, or anone, confident that


1113
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:52.910
萨拉·佩林能够胜任美国总统吗
Sarah Palin now has the wherewithal to be president of the United States?


1114
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:53.730
我不这么认为
I don't think so.


1115
00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:55.760
我的一位保守党朋友跟我在电话里说
A conservative friend called me up and said


1116
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:56.640
"我不能这么做
"I just can't do it.


1117
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:58.900
我不确定自己会不会把票投给奥巴马  
I don't know if I'm voting for Obama,


1118
00:54:58.900 --> 00:54:59.770
但我没法投给她
but I can't have her--


1119
00:54:59.810 --> 00:55:01.770
她不该出现在华盛顿  更别说白宫了"
She shouldn't be in Washington, let alone the White House."


1120
00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:12.550
州长
Governor.


1121
00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:16.890
佩林州长
Governor Palin.


1122
00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.900
我们应该准备一下凯蒂·柯丽克的访问
We really should prep for your Katie Couric interview.


1123
00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.270
行
Fine.


1124
00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.770
我写了一份有关雷曼兄弟垮台
I wrote a brief synopsis on the collapse of Lehman Brothers


1125
00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:37.470
与经济危机的概要
and the financial crisis.


1126
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:38.980
如果你把这份文件背熟
If you internalize this document,


1127
00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:42.450
应该就能应付金融救市的基本问题了
you should be able to field basic questions about the bail-out.


1128
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.090
州长
Governor...


1129
00:55:56.130 --> 00:55:58.590
道琼斯指数下跌了500点
The Dow just dropped 500 points.


1130
00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:00.800
雷曼摇摇欲坠
Lehman is collapsing.


1131
00:56:00.830 --> 00:56:02.830
世界经济正处于崩盘的边缘
The world economy is on the bring of collapse.


1132
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:05.870
所以我确信访问里会涉及金融救市问题
So I am pretty sure the bail-out is going to come up--


1133
00:56:10.570 --> 00:56:12.910
那好
Okay. Um...


1134
00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:20.150
要不你先准备下我们再开始
Wh don't we come back to it after we've warmed up a bit?


1135
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.590
我把凯蒂最有可能提的问题列了出来
I've put together a list of the questions... that Katie's most likely to ask.


1136
00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:30.120
我曾同凯蒂共事过  
I used to work with Katie,


1137
00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.390
我知道她会提流产的问题
and I know she'll ask about abortion.


1138
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:33.860
斯蒂夫做了阿拉斯加的民调没有
Did Steve do the Alaska poll yet?


1139
00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:35.960
应该正在进行中
I think it's being done as we speak.


1140
00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.430
我猜他根本就没做
Bet he didn't even do it.


1141
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:45.470
要不我们试着过几道问题吧
Can we try and get through just a few questions?


1142
00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.380
我知道你心情不好  州长
I know you're upset, Governor.


1143
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.180
要不你今天早点休息
So why don't you get a good night's sleep,


1144
00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:58.020
我明天一早再来
and I will come back first thing in the morning


1145
00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:00.120
等你状态好点我们再继续
to prep you when you're feeling better?


1146
00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.300
我把这个留在这  方便你
I'm gonna leave this for you to...


1147
00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:14.770
看看
look over.


1148
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:21.830
美国正面临继上世纪二三十年代大萧条以来
It's the worst financial crisis facing the American people


1149
00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:24.110
最为严重的经济危机
since the great depression of the 1920s and '30s.


1150
00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.280
布什总统主持的大规模金融救市计划
The president's massive financial rescue plan


1151
00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:28.410
受到左右派的双向夹击
under fire from the left and right.


1152
00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:29.390
晚上好  
Good evening


1153
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:32.580
这里是牛津密西西比大学的福特中心
from the Ford center at the university of Mississippi at Oxford.


1154
00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.680
第一轮辩论即将开始
We're here for the first of three debates


1155
00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.190
辩手是巴拉克·奥巴马参议员
between Senator Barack Obama--


1156
00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:38.220
斯蒂夫  斯蒂夫  别管这些没用的形式
Steve, Steve, let's not worry about that crap.


1157
00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:39.860
都是狗屁
It's all bullshit.


1158
00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:41.520
我都站讲台上了
I'm here at the podium.


1159
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.130
赶紧开始辩论吧
Let's do the fucking debate.


1160
00:57:45.330 --> 00:57:47.000
约翰  抱歉打断一下
Hey, John. Sorry to interrupt.


1161
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:49.870
我刚跟财政部的人通过话
I just spoke to our guy at treasury.


1162
00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:52.770
投票支持议案的共和党人不够
The bill does not have enough Republican votes.


1163
00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.100
见鬼
God damn it.


1164
00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:56.140
保尔森认为世界经济
Paulson thinks the entire world economy


1165
00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:59.070
悬于一线  所以...
is on the brink of falling off the cliff, so...


1166
00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:02.480
咱们进退两难了   要是救市法案没通过
We're checkmated. If the bail-out doesn't pass,


1167
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:04.060
我们就是被布什连累了
we're screwed because Bush,


1168
00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:06.380
所以你就要当替罪羊
and thus you, will be blamed for it.


1169
00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:07.800
如果你通过了救市法案
If you pass the bail-out--


1170
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.180
共和党人会因为我支持
The Republicans will despise me


1171
00:58:09.220 --> 00:58:11.650
-救市法案而鄙视我  -没错
- for supporting a bail-out. - That's it.


1172
00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.690
没错  伙计们
This is it, guys.


1173
00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:17.160
他妈选举就这个德行
I mean, this is the whole fucking election.


1174
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:20.230
现在  我们认为你应该暂缓竞选行程
Now, we think you should suspend the campaign,


1175
00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:22.760
推迟辩论  去一趟华府
postpone the debates, go to Washington,


1176
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.470
努力谈判达成两党协议
and try to negotiate a bi-partisan compromise.


1177
00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.400
你得棋出险招了  约翰
You need to make a bold move, John.


1178
00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:33.340
这可是真险
This is a big risk.


1179
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:36.080
赌注可不小啊
I mean, that's a big gamble.


1180
00:58:37.550 --> 00:58:39.410
我们必须采取行动
We gotta do something.


1181
00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:42.580
没什么比这事更操蛋了
I mean nothing can fuck me more than this.


1182
00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.150
州长  你有没有看过
Governor, have you had a chance


1183
00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:47.120
关于救市计划的材料
to go over the briefing materials on the bail-out?


1184
00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:51.260
我认为我们应该准备两句
I really think we need to try and nail down


1185
00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:53.730
简单的对于此次经济危机的评论
a simple two-sentence response to the economic crisis.


1186
00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.630
-你的评论得支持...  -粉够厚了
- It's gotta be supportive of the concept...  - That's enough powder.


1187
00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:57.470
救市计划的理念
...of the bail-out,


1188
00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:59.460
用时又要对我们目前的处境表示失望
but also disappointed that we're at this point,


1189
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.870
明确指出法案仍需进一步修改
making it clear that changes need to be made to the bill.


1190
00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:05.800
你还想再高点是吗
Oh, you need it a little higher?


1191
00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:08.210
我会弄  我来帮你弄
I can do that. I can do that for you.


1192
00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:11.980
顺便说一句  你穿这件外套美极了
That jacket looks fantastic on you, by the way.


1193
00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:14.040
太露了
It's too open.


1194
00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.850
-你们不觉得吗  -对  非常棒
- Don't you think so - Yeah, it looks wonderful.


1195
00:59:16.880 --> 00:59:18.380
真的很棒  很漂亮
Really great, really nice.


1196
00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:20.320
颜色很好看
It's a great color.


1197
00:59:26.490 --> 00:59:28.930
要我给你读报纸吗
Do you want me to read the paper to you?


1198
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:35.270
"约翰·麦凯恩参议员已经向他的对手
"Senator John McCain has


1199
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:37.870
巴拉克·奥巴马参议员提出请求
requested of his opponent, Senator Barack Obama,


1200
00:59:37.900 --> 00:59:40.300
希望能推迟即将到来的辩论
a postponement of the upcoming debate


1201
00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.870
以便两位参议员能够回到国会大厦
so that both Senators may return to Capitol Hill


1202
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:45.710
专注于此关键时刻的国家需求
to address the needs of the country in this crucial time.


1203
00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:47.610
奥巴马参议员已表示
"Senator Obama has said--"


1204
00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:55.520
我不喜欢这幅妆容  我不喜欢
I hate this make-up. I hate it.


1205
00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:57.920
我也不喜欢这发型  我喜欢全部盘起来
I don't like my hair this way. I like my hair up.


1206
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:59.650
州长  你现在非常美
Governor, you look amazing.


1207
00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:03.690
我看上去很胖   我讨厌看起来胖
I look fat. I'm sick of looking fat.


1208
01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:06.890
-你一点也不胖  -能再给我点胶带吗
- You don't look fat-- - Can I get some more tape?


1209
01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:13.030
我不知道咱们该不该上库瑞克的节目
I don't know if we should do Couric.


1210
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:14.670
她现在有些要崩溃了
She's having a mini-meltdown.


1211
01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.000
我们不能一周内麦凯恩先取消了辩论
Well, we can't have McCain cancel the debate


1212
01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:19.970
佩林又取消凯蒂·库瑞克的采访
and Palin cancel Katie Couric in the same week.


1213
01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:21.640
我知道
I know,


1214
01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.240
但是我真的很担心
but I'm really worried about her.


1215
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.880
我说什么她都不理我
She won't respond to anything I say.


1216
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:28.310
或许我们该告诉麦凯恩  看看他怎么想
Maybe we should bring McCain in and see what he thinks.


1217
01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:30.020
他不想掺和她的事
He doesn't want to deal with her.


1218
01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:32.790
我都还没告诉他  她几乎一无所知
I haven't even told him that she doesn't know anything.


1219
01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.020
你还没告诉他
You haven't told him?


1220
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:37.760
听着  他不想知道
Look, he doesn't want to know.


1221
01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:39.890
世界经济正处于崩溃边缘
The world economy is on the brink of collapse.


1222
01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:43.590
你能不能  在去的路上帮她准备
Can you just... prep her in the car ride over?


1223
01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:47.370
我可以试试
Uh, I can try.


1224
01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.740
很好  那就试试  谢谢了
Okay, good. Try. Thanks.


1225
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:53.600
以我对凯蒂的了解  她一定会问
Knowing Katie, I'm sure she's going to ask


1226
01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.610
你在女权问题上的立场
about your stance on feminism.


1227
01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:57.470
-你有数据吗  -什么
- Did you get the numbers? - The what?


1228
01:00:57.510 --> 01:01:00.740
我在阿拉斯加的支持率
My approval rating in Alaska.


1229
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.810
还不知道
They're not in yet.


1230
01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:04.480
我努力去信任你们
I am trying to trust you people,


1231
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:07.220
但你们却一再让我失望
but you're making it really hard for me.


1232
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:09.590
很抱歉  州长
I'm sorry, Governor.


1233
01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.450
我马上给斯蒂夫打电话问清楚
I'll call Steve right away about it.


1234
01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:13.460
是啊  好像有济于事似的
Yeah, like that'll do anything.


1235
01:01:17.060 --> 01:01:19.400
你在做什么呢  州长
What are you working on, Governor?


1236
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.300
一份来自瓦西拉"马萨谷拓荒者"报上的问卷
It's a questionnaire from the "Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman" in Wasilla.


1237
01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:26.300
一家阿拉斯加的报纸
You know, an Alaska paper.


1238
01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:27.800
你不觉得咱们应该
Don't you think we should prepare


1239
01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.070
先准备库瑞克的全国性采访吗
for your national Couric interview first?


1240
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:31.920
不  妮可  不要
No, Nicolle, I don't.


1241
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.340
这才是我的当务之急
This is my priority.


1242
01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:38.810
我再也不会无视阿拉斯加人民了
I am not going to ignore the people of Alaska any more.


1243
01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:51.730
你将阿拉斯加临近俄罗斯
You've cited Alaska's proximity to Russia


1244
01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.030
作为你外交经验的一部分
as part of your foreign policy experience.


1245
01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.300
请问这是什么意思
What did you mean by that?


1246
01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:59.100
阿拉斯加与俄罗斯之间仅隔着一道
That Alaska has a very narrow maritime border


1247
01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:02.770
非常窄的海上边界  而我们的另一边
between a foreign country, Russia, and on our other side,


1248
01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.940
又与加拿大接壤
the land boundary that we have with Canada.


1249
01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:09.540
可笑的是  这种评论
It's funny that a comment like that


1250
01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:14.180
却有意被...
was kind of made to--


1251
01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:15.680
我说不好  就是那些记者们
I don't know. You know, reporters.


1252
01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.420
-戏谑  -没错  戏谑
- Mocked? - Yeah, mocked.


1253
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:18.850
应该就是这个词
I guess that's the word, yeah.


1254
01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:21.450
那请向我解释一下那为何
Well, explain to me why that enhances


1255
01:02:21.490 --> 01:02:23.460
能够提高你的外交能力
your foreign policy credentials.


1256
01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:27.330
当然可以  因为我们
Well, it certainly does because our--


1257
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.860
我们与其它国家接壤
our next-door neighbors are foreign countries.


1258
01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:33.900
就在我管辖的州里
They're in the state that I am the executive of.


1259
01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:36.600
你是否参与过任何  比如
Have you ever been involved with any negotiations,


1260
01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.540
与俄罗斯方面的谈判
for example, with the Russians?


1261
01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:40.540
我们双方有贸易往来
We have trade missions back and forth.


1262
01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:42.240
没错  当你考虑与俄罗斯有关的
We do. It's very important


1263
01:02:42.270 --> 01:02:45.640
国家安全问题时  这点尤为重要
when you consider even national security issues with Russia.


1264
01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.150
普京昂首阔步进入
As Putin rears his head and comes into the airspace


1265
01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:51.310
美利坚合众国的领空时
of the United States of America,


1266
01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.150
他们去哪儿
where do they go?


1267
01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:56.150
阿拉斯加  正好紧邻着边界
It's Alaska. It's just right over the border.


1268
01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:58.560
说到你对世界格局的看法
And when it comes to establishing your world-view,


1269
01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:02.230
我想知道  在你被提名为副总统候选人前
I was curious-- what newspapers and magazines


1270
01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:06.500
你都读些什么报纸杂志
did you regularly read before you were tapped for this


1271
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:08.300
来了解新闻讯息的
to stay informed and to understand--


1272
01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:11.400
大部分报纸杂志我都读  我也对
I've read most of them, again with a great appreciation


1273
01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.570
出版社和媒体持赞赏态度
for the press, for the media.


1274
01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.070
具体读些什么呢  我很好奇
What ones specifically? I'm curious.


1275
01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:17.740
随便说份报纸
Name one fucking paper.


1276
01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.610
都读过  任何一份
All of 'Em. Any of 'Em


1277
01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.810
曾出现在我面前的都读过
that have been in front of me over all these years.


1278
01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:25.780
老天  咱们到底做了什么
Oh, my God. What have we done?


1279
01:03:25.820 --> 01:03:28.480
如果约翰·麦凯恩赢得大选  这个女人
If John McCain wins, this woman will be


1280
01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.190
将成为72岁美国总统的
one 72-year-old's heartbeat away


1281
01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:33.920
第一继承人
from President of the United States.


1282
01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.460
如果你以前没觉得害怕  现在是时候了
And if that doesn't scare the hell out of you, it should.


1283
01:03:36.490 --> 01:03:38.590
公道点说  可能大部分人
In fairness, probably most people


1284
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:41.230
都说不出一个最高法院的案子
can't name a supreme court case.


1285
01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.760
但是大部分人并没在竞选
But most people are not campaigning


1286
01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.400
-副总统  -对啊  没错
- to be vice president . - Right, right.


1287
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:48.170
她不是不知道正确答案
It's not that she doesn't know the right answer.


1288
01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.310
而是压根就听不懂问题
It's that she clearly does not understand the question.


1289
01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:54.870
这比之前任何一位候选人
This is way beyond anything we have ever seen


1290
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:56.680
所出现的任何问题都严重
from a national candidate.


1291
01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.750
你为什么让我做凯蒂·库瑞克的采访
Why'd you make me do Katie Couric?


1292
01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:05.850
你看到新闻报道了吗  看了吗
Did you see the coverage? Did you?


1293
01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:07.990
你在吗  你在听我说吗
Are you there? Are you listening to me?


1294
01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.120
是的  州长  我在听
Yes, Governor. I'm here.


1295
01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.620
凯蒂是合乎常理的选择
Katie was a logical choice.


1296
01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.660
竞选开始至今  她一直对我们不偏不倚
She's been very fair to us this entire campaign.


1297
01:04:13.690 --> 01:04:15.030
你认为这场采访很公平
You call that interview fair?


1298
01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.700
是的  州长  没错
Yes, Governor, I do.


1299
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:19.670
我不敢苟同  她从一开始就想搞垮我
I certainly don't. She was out to get me from the get-go.


1300
01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.070
不  她没有
No, she wasn't.


1301
01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.570
采访搞砸了是因为你没努力
The interview sucked because you didn't try.


1302
01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.400
什么叫我没努力
What do you mean, I didn't try?


1303
01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.800
你没像在接受查理·吉本森采访时
You didn't fight back like you did


1304
01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:26.940
那样全力反击
in the Charlie Gibson interview.


1305
01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:28.170
当初你不知道答案时
When you didn't know the answers,


1306
01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:29.910
你就反问回去  效果很好
you clawed your way back and it went fine.


1307
01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:31.640
可是这次你却放弃了
You just gave up.


1308
01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:33.510
妮可  这不是我的错
Nicolle, it wasn't my fault.


1309
01:04:33.550 --> 01:04:35.450
是你们没帮我准备
I wasn't properly prepped.


1310
01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.520
那是因为你根本不听我们的
You weren't properly prepped because you wouldn't listen to us.


1311
01:04:38.550 --> 01:04:40.650
你从不听顾问们的意见
You never listen to your advisors.


1312
01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:42.650
因为你们一直给我灌输庞大的信息量
Because you're overwhelming me


1313
01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:44.620
让我喘不过气来
with too much information.


1314
01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:46.620
我不想接受这些采访
I don't want to do these interviews.


1315
01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.790
只想做我想做的
I want to do what I want to do.


1316
01:04:48.830 --> 01:04:52.100
我们在帮你克服难关  州长
We're just trying to help you get through this, Governor.


1317
01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:54.000
我们只期望你能赢
All we want is for you to succeed.


1318
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.000
是吗  你们根本没在帮我
Yeah, well, you're not helping.


1319
01:04:56.030 --> 01:04:57.900
你们在搞垮我
You're just screwing me up.


1320
01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:01.070
你们告诉我该说什么  穿什么  怎么说
You're telling me what to say, what to wear, how to talk.


1321
01:05:01.100 --> 01:05:03.140
我不是你们的傀儡
I am not your puppet!


1322
01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:04.670
现在我终于明白希拉里说
Now I understand what Hillary meant


1323
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:06.380
她要找到属于她自己的声音是什么意思了
when she said she had to find her own voice.


1324
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:10.110
是吗  你以为你跟希拉里一样
Yeah, 'cause you're just like Hillary.


1325
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:14.520
你们已经毁了我
You have ruined me.


1326
01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:16.820
毁了我的名誉
You have ruined my reputation.


1327
01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:20.090
我在阿拉斯加的名声也被毁了
I am ruined in Alaska!


1328
01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.200
我是斯蒂夫·施密特  请留言
This is Steve Schmidt. Leave a message.


1329
01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:34.130
斯蒂夫  我是妮可
Steve, it's Nicolle.


1330
01:05:34.170 --> 01:05:36.570
如果你想让我为库瑞克这件事负责我很愿意辞职
I will gladly resign if you want to blame me for Couric.


1331
01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.850
但如果你要我留下来
But if you want me to stay,


1332
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.610
那我从明天起为麦凯恩工作
then I'm back on McCain's bus tomorrow


1333
01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:42.280
我再也不想管那个女人了
as I never want to deal with that woman ever again.


1334
01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:46.750
从伊拉克事件中你得到了什么教训
What lessons have you learned from Iraq


1335
01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:50.750
而你又将如何具体地在国外推进民主
and how specifically would you spread democracy abroad?


1336
01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.750
具体来说  我们将尽一切努力
Specifically, we would make every effort possible


1337
01:05:53.790 --> 01:05:56.490
将民主传播到需要民主的国家去
to spread democracy abroad to those who want it.


1338
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.430
没错  请具体说说你会怎么做
Yes, but specifically , what would you do?


1339
01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.430
我们要推动自由
We're gonna promote freedom,


1340
01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.200
引入民主的价值观念与思想
usher in Democratic values and ideals,


1341
01:06:08.230 --> 01:06:11.040
与极端恐怖分子作斗争
and fight terror-loving terrorists.


1342
01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.870
但是  我不是想过分强调
But again, and not to belabor the point,


1343
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:18.880
能说个具体举措吗
one specific thing.


1344
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:30.120
凯蒂  我想打个求助电话
Katie, I'd like to use one of my lifelines.


1345
01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:41.360
-你说什么  -我想给一个朋友打电话
- I'm sorry? - I want to phone a friend.


1346
01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.470
周五的辩论应该照常进行
...Friday's debate should proceed.


1347
01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:47.570
我们时刻不停地工作
We've been working around the clock


1348
01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.410
作为国家总统就应该能同时
...and presidents are going to have to deal with


1349
01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.440
处理多件事务
more than one thing at a time.


1350
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.510
新的CNN联合《时报》的民调显示
A new CNN/Time opinion research poll


1351
01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.760
奥巴马在若干
show Obama surging in


1352
01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:58.080
-摇摆州中支持率猛增  -狗娘养的
- key battleground states... - Son of a bitch.


1353
01:06:58.110 --> 01:07:00.280
例如他已经在宾夕尼亚州领先九个百分点
...Like Pennsylvania where he is now up by nine points.


1354
01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.720
州长  我只是想告诉你
Governor, I just want you to know


1355
01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:04.890
我已经得到你在阿拉斯加的民调数字
I got your Alaskan poll numbers in,


1356
01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.920
很高兴告诉你
and you'll be pleased to know


1357
01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:10.190
-你的支持率超过了70%  -很好
- that you're in the low 70s. - Fine.


1358
01:07:18.330 --> 01:07:21.130
-他们为什么这样搞我  -谁
- Why are they fucking me like this? - Who?


1359
01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:24.440
媒体  他们以前很喜欢我啊
The press! They used to love me.


1360
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:28.010
而现在他们就靠搞垮我活着
Now all they want to do in life is fuck me over.


1361
01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.410
真不敢相信凯蒂那样对我
I can't believe Katie did that to me.


1362
01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.080
你知道昨晚奥伯曼是怎么说我的吗
And did you hear what Olbermann said about me last night?


1363
01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:36.780
先生  你不能再看吉斯·奥伯曼的节目
Sir, you've got to stop watching Keith Olbermann,


1364
01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:38.170
或福克斯台了
or FOX, for that matter.


1365
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:40.190
他们都在扯淡
It's all just bullshit.


1366
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.690
现在  先生  你应该喝杯啤酒
Now, sir, you should have a beer


1367
01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.660
24小时专门播放体育节目的有线电视联播网

1368
01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.660
看看ESPN  明白吗
and watch ESPN, okay?


1369
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:48.160
并且你在看节目时
And while you're watching it,


1370
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:50.530
顺便想想那些看ESPN的人
think about what the people who watch ESPN


1371
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.530
现在最需要的是什么
really need in their lives right now.


1372
01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.230
我还以为凯蒂支持我
I thought Katie liked me.


1373
01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:57.500
她支持  而且这些问题也很客观公平
She does. And the questions were fair.


1374
01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:01.370
是佩林州长没有做好采访
It was Governor Palin who gave a terrible interview.


1375
01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:03.070
那可怜的姑娘
That poor girl.


1376
01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.480
她尚未做好准备
She wasn't ready for this.


1377
01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:09.750
是啊  恐怕你是对的  先生
Yeah, I'm afraid you're right, sir.


1378
01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:14.250
而且YouTube加速了事情的恶化
And YouTube is making it exponentially worse.


1379
01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:16.650
人们把凯蒂·库瑞克和蒂娜·费的节目
People are watching Katie Couric and Tina fey


1380
01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:17.650
蒂娜·费: 著名女笑星,在SNL中模仿萨拉·佩林

1381
01:08:16.690 --> 01:08:18.160
看了一遍又一遍
over and over again.


1382
01:08:18.190 --> 01:08:20.790
在网络上无限循环
It's playing like an infinite loop on the web.


1383
01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:24.360
以往的大选从没碰到过这种情况
No presidential campaign has ever had to deal with this before.


1384
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:28.400
但她在辩论中会有好表现的  对吗
But she's gonna do a good job in the debate, right?


1385
01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:31.070
是的  先生  她会表现得很棒
Yes, sir. She'll be great.


1386
01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.420
因为要是库瑞克采访的那一幕重演
'Cause if it goes like Couric,


1387
01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.740
我们就再无回天之力了
I don't think we can recover.


1388
01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:37.210
同意  我保证她会表现得很棒的
I agree, and I promise she'll be great.


1389
01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:39.140
希望你是对的
I hope you're right.


1390
01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:43.350
我希望你是对的  斯蒂夫
I hope you're right, Steve.


1391
01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:45.480
一切都会好起来的
It's gonna be fine.


1392
01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:57.830
好了  这是96年辩论中出现的问题
Okay, this one came up in the '96 debate.


1393
01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:59.630
是否有解决
Is there a magic bullet


1394
01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:01.800
公共教育问题的灵丹妙药
to solve the problem of public education?


1395
01:09:01.830 --> 01:09:04.870
如果没有  最佳解决方案是什么
If not, what is the best solution?


1396
01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:08.870
费城

1397
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.870
9月27日

1398
01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:10.640
州长
Uh, Governor?


1399
01:09:17.310 --> 01:09:20.050
州长  你想吃点什么吗
Governor, would you like something to eat?


1400
01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:26.620
没错  你是该吃点东西了  州长
Yeah, I think you should eat something, Governor.


1401
01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:28.390
美国著名软性饮料品牌

1402
01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:28.390
来一瓶无糖的胡椒博士如何
How about a diet Dr. Pepper?


1403
01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:30.220
你想...能不能
Would you like-- could you?


1404
01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.390
州长
Governor?


1405
01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:40.400
我想我的孩子了  我想和他一起睡觉
I miss my baby. I miss sleeping with my baby.


1406
01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:45.240
她不断陷入毫无知觉的恍惚中
She constantly slips into these catatonic stupors.


1407
01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:47.170
等我们好不容易让她开始工作
And then when we do finally get her to work,


1408
01:09:47.210 --> 01:09:49.010
她把所有东西都写在卡片上
she writes all the information down on notecards,


1409
01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:51.040
却一点都记不住
but she can't remember any of it.


1410
01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:54.610
斯蒂夫  你在阿拉斯加做过民调了吗
Steve, did you do an approval poll in Alaska?


1411
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:56.980
-她一直在提这事儿  -搞毛啊
- She keeps bringing it up. - What the fuck?


1412
01:09:57.020 --> 01:09:59.450
我一周前做了那个该死的民调
I did that stupid fucking poll a week ago.


1413
01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.190
我告诉她支持率超过了70%
I told her she's in the 70s.


1414
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.690
好吧  我觉得她不相信你
Yeah, well, I don't think she believes you.


1415
01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:04.290
她说这些数据是你瞎编的
She says you made those numbers up.


1416
01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.090
好吧
Okay.


1417
01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:09.630
-她越来越无理取闹了  -越来越吗
- She is becoming completely irrational. - Becoming?


1418
01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:13.730
我不想这样说
I don't even like to say this,


1419
01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.430
但是你们有没有想过
but has it occurred to you guys


1420
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:17.400
她可能精神不稳定
that she might be mentally unstable?


1421
01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:24.070
马克  听着  五天后就要辩论了
Mark, look, the debate is in five days.


1422
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:26.040
你有何想法
What do you think?


1423
01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:31.950
我认为这场辩论将是历史性的惨败
I think this debate will be a debacle of historic


1424
01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.620
前所未有的一边倒
and epic proportions.


1425
01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:39.690
这倒是挺鼓舞人心的
Well, that's encouraging.


1426
01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:58.210
你觉得让你被选为副总统候选人的
What would you say best qualifies you


1427
01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.710
最重要因素是什么
to be John McCain's running mate?


1428
01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:06.280
约翰·麦凯恩十分独立有主见
John McCain has that streak of independence in him


1429
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:10.080
这是作为现代领袖所必须的品质
that I think is very, very important in our leadership today.


1430
01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:11.990
我本身也是如此
I have that within me also.


1431
01:11:12.020 --> 01:11:14.250
所以约翰·麦凯恩才会提名我
And that's why John McCain tapped me,


1432
01:11:14.290 --> 01:11:16.260
一起组成革新之队
to be a team of mavericks,


1433
01:11:16.290 --> 01:11:19.460
独立之队  作为这个队伍的成员
of independence as a team member


1434
01:11:19.490 --> 01:11:22.330
在这个  新队伍里
on this, um-- in this new team.


1435
01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.760
这个回答我要重说一遍
Um, I'm gonna do that one over again.


1436
01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.270
-好的  当然  -约翰
- Yeah, sure. - John--


1437
01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.030
州长  记住这点
Governor, important to remember


1438
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:32.000
你没必要说得很具体
that you don't need to say anything specific.


1439
01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.770
明白吗  如果你不知道问题的答案
Okay? If you don't know the answer to the question,


1440
01:11:34.810 --> 01:11:37.780
就说回到重塑美国的主题上来
just bring it back to the general theme of reforming America


1441
01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:40.640
或者转移到你的强项上  比如能源
or pivot to one of your stronger suits, like energy.


1442
01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.610
好的  因为那是我最得心应手的部分
Yeah, 'cause that's where I'm most comfortable.


1443
01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:45.750
非常明显
That's pretty clear.


1444
01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.550
再来试试另一个问题
Let's try another question.


1445
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:49.090
全球变暖
Global warming--


1446
01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.750
佩林州长  你是否相信
Governor Palin, do you believe


1447
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:52.990
全球变暖是人为所致
that global warming is man-made?


1448
01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:00.160
我认为  这些无谓的关于全球变暖
I think all this talk and gibber-gabber


1449
01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.670
原因的无聊言论和胡言乱语完全掩盖了
about where global warming comes from defeats--


1450
01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:06.670
掩盖了地球越来越热的事实				
defeats, you know, the point that it's getting hotter


1451
01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:10.870
我们都应给非常关注变暖这件事
and that we all need to be very concerned about heat.


1452
01:12:10.910 --> 01:12:13.110
和  呃
And, um...


1453
01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:14.610
那个...
That, um...


1454
01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:16.780
我...我...
I-- I--


1455
01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:18.250
不记得了  这里也没有
forgot it and it's not in this--


1456
01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:21.580
马克  所有卡片都该在这一摞里
Mark, all the cards are supposed to be in this pile.


1457
01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:23.420
-好的  - 这摞里没有
- Okay. - It's not in this pile.


1458
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:26.090
大家需要休息一下
I think we need to take a break.


1459
01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.190
都出去一下好吗
Can you all leave us alone for a minute?


1460
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.800
还有四天就是辩论会
The debate is in four days,


1461
01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.310
照此下去可不行  州长
and this isn't working, Governor.


1462
01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:46.410
我知道
I know.


1463
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.210
我觉得你得赶紧扔了这些没营养的东西
I think you should get off this no-carb diet immediately.


1464
01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:57.650
随意节食会害了你
This goofy diet is bad for you,


1465
01:12:57.690 --> 01:12:59.750
你的日益消瘦让我很担心
and I'm alarmed by your weight loss.


1466
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.460
州长  凯蒂·库瑞克的访谈没有做好
Governor, the Katie Couric interview didn't go well.


1467
01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:09.360
但这不是妮可·华莱士的错
And it wasn't Nicolle Wallace's fault.


1468
01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.160
不是凯蒂·库瑞克的错
It wasn't Katie Couric's fault.


1469
01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.330
也不是自由派媒体的错
It wasn't the liberal media's fault.


1470
01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:16.670
是你的问题  因为你准备不足
It was your fault, because you didn't prepare.


1471
01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:18.900
以后再也不能出现这种
And there can never be another instance


1472
01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:22.340
因为你没准备好而失败的事了
of something not going well because you didn't prepare.


1473
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:39.560
听着  这次访谈没做好
Look, you had a bad interview.


1474
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:42.990
没关系  这种事常有
It's okay, it happens.


1475
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:48.000
你知道罗纳德·里根说什么是污染的源头吗
You know what Ronald Reagan said caused pollution?


1476
01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:51.100
树
Trees.


1477
01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.640
- 里根这么说了吗  -没错
- Reagan said that? - He did.


1478
01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.110
他说树造成了污染
He said trees cause pollution.


1479
01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:04.410
可他不仅在选举中获胜
And he not only won the election,


1480
01:14:04.450 --> 01:14:07.480
还成为了一位伟大的总统
he went on to be a great president.


1481
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:15.390
只是我...我不想拖累约翰
I just-- I don't want to let John down.


1482
01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:26.670
斯蒂夫
Stevie boy.


1483
01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:29.170
我们有麻烦了
We have a problem, sir.


1484
01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:32.470
怎么  出什么事了
What-- what's going on?


1485
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:34.710
是佩林
It's Palin.


1486
01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:38.680
她可能就快崩溃了
She could be on the verge of a complete nervous breakdown.


1487
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:43.850
我不知道该怎么办
I don't know what to do.


1488
01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:47.490
我们没准备救命绳索便将她扔下深渊
We threw her into the deep end without a life preserver.


1489
01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:49.190
是啊  然后拖带我们走上绝路
Yeah, and we're drowning with her, sir.


1490
01:14:51.660 --> 01:14:53.460
我们需要让她回到家人身边
We need to get her back with her family.


1491
01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:56.630
她需要爱她的人
She needs to be surrounded by--


1492
01:14:56.660 --> 01:14:59.330
陪伴左右
by people who love her.


1493
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:03.370
把他们都接去塞多纳吧
Hey, let's get 'em all out to Sedona,


1494
01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:05.300
呼吸呼吸新鲜空气
out in the open air.


1495
01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:07.110
我的邻居是个医生
My neighbor's a doctor,


1496
01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:10.540
辛迪可以请他来参加烧烤聚会
and Cindy can invite him over for a barbeque or something,


1497
01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:12.280
然后从旁观察
and he can observe her


1498
01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:14.580
看看佩林的情况是否严重
and see if it's truly serious.


1499
01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:16.350
先把他们接去塞多纳吧
But let's just get 'em to Sedona.


1500
01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.750
肯定对她大有裨益
It'll do wonders for her, I know it.


1501
01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.650
当然  没问题
Yes, sir. Absolutely.


1502
01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:31.160
*更加青翠的牧场*
? There be greener pastures


1503
01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:39.570
*就在边境的另一边*
? Cross that border line ?


1504
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:48.510
*崭新的地平线*
? We'll see new horizons ?


1505
01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.350
*我的爱人*
? My darling ?


1506
01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:56.620
*就在峡谷的远端*
? Far beyond the great divide ?


1507
01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:00.790
我想死你们了
I missed you guys so much.


1508
01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:03.930
-妈妈  妈妈  -我的天啊
- Hi! Mommy, mommy! - Oh, my goodness!


1509
01:16:05.690 --> 01:16:07.100
有个小家伙也想打个招呼
Got someone who wants to say hi.


1510
01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:09.230
你好
Hi!


1511
01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.700
-你好  医生  -你好吗
- What's up, doc? - Hey, how you doing?


1512
01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:18.310
难说  她看起来怎么样
That depends. How's she look?


1513
01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.670
对于一个刚生完孩子
For a woman who's just had a baby,


1514
01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:22.400
未成年女儿怀有身孕
has a pregnant teen daughter


1515
01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.810
儿子远在伊拉克的女人
and a son in Iraq,


1516
01:16:23.850 --> 01:16:26.680
我觉得她还算不错
I'd say not half bad.


1517
01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:30.680
你倒是一团糟
You, however, look like shit.


1518
01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.260
他们一直告诉我一大堆东西
They keep piling all this stuff on me,


1519
01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:37.290
我就是没法全部都记住
and I just can't remember everything.


1520
01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.130
-总能记住其中一些吧  -是啊
- Are you getting some of it? - Yeah.


1521
01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:45.200
一些  可我得在台上讲90分钟
Some, but I have to talk for like 90 minutes up there.


1522
01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:47.570
<b>安德鲁·海尔科 佩林竞选阿拉斯加州州长时的竞争对手</b>

1523
01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:47.570
还记得你跟海尔科的那场辩论吗
Do you remember when you debated Halcro?


1524
01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:50.440
他没有笔记没有草稿
He had no notes, no papers,


1525
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:53.940
却能一直举例论据  滔滔不绝
and he could spout off all these facts and figures?


1526
01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:56.410
你被吓坏了
You were so intimidated...


1527
01:16:57.540 --> 01:16:59.110
直到你看向观众
Until you looked out at the audience.


1528
01:16:59.150 --> 01:17:00.850
你意识到了什么
What'd you realize?


1529
01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:03.350
我意识到他说什么都无关紧要
That none of what he said mattered,


1530
01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:05.620
因为谁也听不懂
because no one knew what he was talking about.


1531
01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:08.920
现在也一样  老婆  人多一些罢了
It's the same thing here, baby. It's just more people.


1532
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:11.420
你现在麻烦不断
You're getting yourself in trouble,


1533
01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.920
是因为他们想把你
because they're trying to turn you


1534
01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.030
变成一个完全不同的人
into something that you're not.


1535
01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:17.700
你得按自己的方式做
You gotta do what you do.


1536
01:17:17.730 --> 01:17:20.860
按你的方式跟观众交流
Just talk to people the way you talk to them.


1537
01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:23.130
他们会爱你的
And they'll love you.


1538
01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.270
他们一直都爱你
They always have.


1539
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:29.510
我爱你  头号粉丝
I love you, first dude.


1540
01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.640
我也爱你
I love you, too...


1541
01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:34.910
副总统女士
Mrs. Vice President.


1542
01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.710
斯蒂夫  出什么事了
Steve, what's up?


1543
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:12.510
这场辩论需要萨拉·佩林回答多少问题
How many questions does Sarah Palin have to answer in the debate?


1544
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:15.620
22至25个

1545
01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:17.650
一个问题多长时间
And how long is each answer?


1546
01:18:17.690 --> 01:18:19.520
算上转移提问两分钟
Two minutes with pivots.


1547
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:24.120
因此我们只需要让美国政坛最佳女演员
So if all we have to do is get the best actress in American politics


1548
01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:27.360
背下45分钟的标准答案
to memorize 45 minutes' worth of answers,


1549
01:18:27.390 --> 01:18:29.560
那为何浪费五天时间
then why did we waste five days


1550
01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.470
试图让她理解答案的意思呢
trying to get her to understand what any of this shit means?


1551
01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:38.640
州长  我没听你说要跑步啊
Governor, I didn't know you were going for a jog.


1552
01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:40.040
我有个新策略
I have a different strategy.


1553
01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.670
我需要让头脑清醒一点
I need to clear my head for a bit.


1554
01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:43.780
我们需要准备...
Well, we really need to prepare--


1555
01:18:43.810 --> 01:18:45.880
我真的需要跑个步  斯蒂夫
I really need to go running, Steve,


1556
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:47.680
因为这样能让我好受些
'cause it's gonna make me feel better.


1557
01:18:47.710 --> 01:18:49.150
你能明白吗
Can you understand that?


1558
01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:51.220
明白  州长
Of course, Governor.


1559
01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:08.230
我想我们要丢掉这些卡片
I think we need to get rid of these notecards.


1560
01:19:08.270 --> 01:19:11.700
-它们没用  -好吧
- They're not helping. - Okay.


1561
01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:13.770
反正我也恨死这些卡片了
I hate those flippin' cards anyway.


1562
01:19:13.810 --> 01:19:17.040
现在  我们需要你
Now, what we need you to do


1563
01:19:17.070 --> 01:19:21.080
记住25个问题的答案和4条反问
is to memorize 25 answers and four attack lines.


1564
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:24.150
你能做到吗
Do you think you can do that?


1565
01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.780
是的  我能做到
Yeah, I can do that.


1566
01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:30.020
那你就没问题
And you're gonna be great.


1567
01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:51.840
正如里根总统所说
And we are to be that shining city on a hill,


1568
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:54.980
我们将成为顶峰最闪亮的城市
as President Reagan so beautifully said,


1569
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:57.510
我们是希望的灯塔
and that we are a beacon of hope


1570
01:19:57.550 --> 01:20:00.450
不需要向任何人解释我们的存在
and that we are unapologetic here.


1571
01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.880
佩林州长
Governor Palin,


1572
01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.720
伊朗核项目是我们最大的威胁之一
nuclear Iran is one of our gravest threats.


1573
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:09.020
麦凯恩政府会采取什么制裁措施
What would a McCain administration do to stop it?


1574
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.660
在伊朗核问题上
On the subject of "nucular" Iran,


1575
01:20:11.690 --> 01:20:14.190
我基本赞成参议员奥拜登的观点
Senator O'Biden and I are most likely in agreement.


1576
01:20:14.230 --> 01:20:20.100
决不允许他们拥有任何核武器
They cannot be allowed to acquire "nucular" weapons, period.


1577
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.370
当然  在同伊朗总统内贾德的较量中
Israel is in jeopardy, of course,


1578
01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:26.700
以色列目前处于劣势
when dealing with Ahmadi Nejad as a leader of Iran.


1579
01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:29.410
罗纳德·里根曾说过  自由的延续与毁灭
It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom


1580
01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.640
就看一代人的选择
is always just one generation away from extinction.


1581
01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:35.880
自由不是血脉相传的
We don't pass it to our children in the bloodstream,


1582
01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.880
而需要我们去争取  去捍卫
we have to fight for it and protect it,


1583
01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.350
将其亲手交与后辈
and then hand it to them


1584
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:42.790
他们才能同样争取捍卫自由
so that they shall do the same.


1585
01:20:42.820 --> 01:20:44.620
我们会为之奋斗
We will fight for it.


1586
01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:47.220
而这场选举中  唯有一人
And there is only one man in this race


1587
01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:51.000
曾真正为你们争取过自由
who has really ever fought for you,


1588
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:53.130
那就是参议员约翰·麦凯恩
and that's Senator John McCain.


1589
01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.470
真棒
Yeah!


1590
01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:56.970
太好了 她找回状态了
Yeah, she's back!


1591
01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:00.700
萨拉·佩林回归了  女士们先生们
Sarah Palin is back, ladies and gentlemen.


1592
01:21:02.270 --> 01:21:04.340
-干得漂亮  州长  -还不错吧
- Great job, Governor. - It was pretty good, huh?


1593
01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:05.840
岂止不错  简直一级棒
Pretty good? It was amazing.


1594
01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.240
只有一个小错误需要纠正
There's just one slight adjustment I want to give you.


1595
01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.380
你应该叫他参议员拜登
You need to call him Senator Biden,


1596
01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:11.390
而不是参议员奥拜登
not Senator O'Biden.


1597
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:13.350
我是这么说的  参议员奥拜登
That's what I called him, Senator O'Biden.


1598
01:21:13.380 --> 01:21:15.020
-你又错了  -哪里错了
- You just said it again. - Said what?


1599
01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:17.450
-奥拜登  -对  参议员拜登
- O'Biden. - Right. Senator Biden.


1600
01:21:17.490 --> 01:21:20.320
-对了  -噢  拜登
- That's it. - Oh. Biden.


1601
01:21:20.360 --> 01:21:21.570
不  没有奥
No, no, there's no "O."


1602
01:21:21.570 --> 01:21:23.560
这是"噢 我懂了"的"噢"
No, I meant "Oh," As in "Oh, I get it,"


1603
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:25.190
不是奥拜登的"奥"
not "O" As in O'Biden.


1604
01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.530
好吧  我们练练
Okay, well, let's practice it.


1605
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:32.530
州长  你赞成参议员拜登
Governor, do you agree with Senator Biden's


1606
01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:34.070
在救市计划上的立场吗
position on the bail-out?


1607
01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:35.940
-参议员奥拜登...  -拜登
- Senator O'Biden-- - Biden!


1608
01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:37.440
真该死
Doggone it!


1609
01:21:51.150 --> 01:21:53.620
-我是萨拉  -是我  妈妈
- This is Sarah. - Hey, mom.


1610
01:21:53.650 --> 01:21:55.690
乖儿子  你还好吗
Hey, honey. How are ya?


1611
01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:57.120
我很好  我...
I'm good. I'm--


1612
01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.560
-我很好  妈妈  -你在哪儿呢
- I'm good, mom. - Where are you?


1613
01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:01.930
这个我不能透露
Um, I'm not really allowed to say.


1614
01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:04.030
好吧  宝贝  不过你是安全的吧
Okay, sweetie, but you're safe?


1615
01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:06.200
是啊  别担心  我很安全
Yeah, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.


1616

1618
01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.240
-你有学习吗  -有

1619
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:14.910

-集合  -我得挂了  妈妈

1626
01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:31.590

抱歉  我真的得走了
No, I'm really sorry, but I really gotta go.

1631
01:22:40.630 --> 01:22:42.470
再见
Bye.


1632
01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:50.840
你还好吧
You okay?


1633
01:22:52.410 --> 01:22:54.510
我儿子很安全
My son is safe.


1634
01:22:55.980 --> 01:22:57.750
我儿子很安全
My son is safe.


1635
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:11.230
我们即将看到的
Well, what we are going to see


1636
01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:13.860
将是我所报道过的
is probably the most anticipated


1637
01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:18.370
最令人期待的副总统辩论
vice presidential debate that I have covered ever.


1638
01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:20.980
华盛顿大学
圣路易斯


1639
01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.770
萨拉·佩林承受着巨大压力
A lot, a lot of pressure on Sarah Palin.


1640
01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.980
10月2日

1641
01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.740
而对乔·拜登来讲
As for Joe Biden, it's sort of a,


1642
01:23:22.770 --> 01:23:25.070
今晚不必有所顾忌
first of all, do-no-harm night for him.


1643
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:26.940
至少没有人会质疑
No one has questioned


1644
01:23:26.940 --> 01:23:29.880
他当副总统的资格
that he is qualified to be vice president.


1645
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:31.480
他需要...他们都需要
He needs to-- both of them,


1646
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:33.450
需要重点谈论各自的总统候选人
need to talk about the top of their tickets.


1647
01:23:33.480 --> 01:23:36.380
毕竟  这场选举不是在选副总统
After all, this isn't a race to be vice president


1648
01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:39.120
所以在选票事宜上
so much as it is to be number two


1649
01:23:39.150 --> 01:23:41.120
他们只是二号人物
to the top people on the ticket.


1650
01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:43.860
在乔·拜登方面  你肯定会听到
On the Joe Biden side, you will see


1651
01:23:43.890 --> 01:23:46.890
他强调  "瞧  萨拉·佩林..."
an effort to say, "Look, Sarah Palin..."


1652
01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:49.860
快点
Hurry.


1653
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:51.730
我们一起祈祷
Pray with me.


1654
01:23:51.770 --> 01:23:53.570
祈祷什么呢
What should we pray for?


1655
01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.200
祈祷我们能赢了这场辩论
Just pray that we win the debate.


1656
01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.900
妈妈  这可是作弊
Mom, that would be cheating.


1657
01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:05.710
好了
Okay.

Was this the worst of Washington or the best of Washington

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:20.770
感谢你   格温  也感谢选举委员会
Thank you, Gwen, and I thank the commission also.


1711
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:22.910
能有幸在此同全美人民对话
I appreciate this privilege of being able to be here


1712
01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:24.410
我很感激
and speak with Americans.


1713
01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:26.710
上帝保佑啊
Please, God, be kind.


1714
01:26:26.740 --> 01:26:28.610
我认为  在我们试图评判
You know, I think a good barometer here


1715
01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:31.180
此时对美国经济是好是坏时
when we're trying to figure out has this been a good time


1716
01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:34.820
最好的标准就是
or a bad time in America's economy is...


1717
01:26:34.850 --> 01:26:37.090
周六去看场儿童足球赛
go to a kids' soccer game on Saturday


1718
01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:40.090
转身随便问个场外的家长
and turn to any parent there on the sideline and ask them,


1719
01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:41.960
"你觉得现在经济状况如何"
"How are you feeling about the economy?"


1720
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:43.560
我敢保证你能从他的回答中
And I'll betcha you're gonna hear


1721
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:45.960
听出一丝恐惧
some fear in that parent's voice...


1722
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.360
她做得不错啊
She's doing great.


1723
01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:50.170
我们还有88分钟呢
We've got 88 more minutes.


1724
01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:53.570
我们的投资是不是都打了水漂了
Did we just take a major hit with those investments?


1725
01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:56.970
是要谈到人类活动对气候的影响
There is something to be said also for man's activities,


1726
01:26:57.010 --> 01:27:00.710
但也要考虑到地球周期性温度变化的因素
but also for the cyclical temperature changes on our planet.


1727
01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:03.750
参议员  这些原因中孰是孰非
Senator, what is true and what is false about the causes?


1728
01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:06.910
如果不清楚问题的源泉
If you don't understand what the cause is,


1729
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:09.420
就无法采取正确的措施
it's virtually impossible to come up with a solution.


1730
01:27:09.450 --> 01:27:12.420
现在的口号是"钻啊钻井打石油"
The chant is "Drill, baby, drill."


1731
01:27:12.450 --> 01:27:15.220
不管我们在哪举行集会
And that's what we hear all across this country


1732
01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:17.990
都能听见大家高喊口号
in our rallies, because people are so hungry


1733
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:20.430
渴望这些国内能源
for those domestic sources of energy


1734
01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:22.460
能被更加充分地利用
to be tapped into.


1735
01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.130
我们会结束这场战争
We will end this war.


1736
01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.570
若麦凯恩当选
For John McCain,


1737
01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.740
战争会无休无止
there is no end in sight to end this war.


1738
01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:31.040
而我们会结束这场战争
We will end this war.


1739
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:33.140
州长女士
Governor...


1740
01:27:33.170 --> 01:27:36.610
你的计划
Your plan


1741
01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.010
无疑是要让我们在伊拉克
is a white flag of surrender


1742
01:27:39.050 --> 01:27:40.780
-缴械投降  -太棒了
- in Iraq. - Yes!


1743
01:27:42.250 --> 01:27:43.880
州长  请问您对于麦凯恩参议员
Governor, please, did you want to respond


1744
01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.820
就医保的回答  有何回应
to Senator McCain's comments about healthcare?


1745
01:27:45.850 --> 01:27:47.490
转移话题  快
Pivot. Pivot!


1746
01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:50.320
我想就提高税收这一问题进行回应
I'd like to respond about the tax increases and...


1747
01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.260
这就对了
Yes!


1748
01:27:52.290 --> 01:27:54.790
我们要增加就业
Darn right, we need tax relief


1749
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:57.160
当然要减轻美国民众的税收负担
for Americans so that jobs can be created here.


1750
01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:59.160
巴拉克·奥巴马和奥拜登参议员
Barack Obama and Senator O'Biden,


1751
01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:01.170
你们什么都不认可
you said no to everything...


1752
01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.900
她刚说了奥拜登
She just said O'Biden.


1753
01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:04.500
大概只有我们注意到了
We're probably the only ones that heard it.


1754
01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:07.200
罗纳德·里根曾说过  自由的延续与毁灭
It was Ronald Reagan who said that freedom


1755
01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:10.940
就看一代人的选择
is always just one generation away from extinction.


1756
01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:14.940
自由不是血脉相传的
We don't pass it to our children in the bloodstream.


1757
01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:18.680
而需要我们去争取  去捍卫
We have to fight for it and protect it,


1758
01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.280
将其亲手交与后辈
and then hand it to them


1759
01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:22.750
他们才能同样争取捍卫自由
so that they will do the same.


1760
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:24.790
我们会为之奋斗
We will fight for it.


1761
01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:27.320
而这场选举中  唯有一人
And there is only one man in this race


1762
01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.630
曾真正为你们争取过自由
who has really ever fought for you,


1763
01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:32.230
那就是参议员约翰·麦凯恩
and that's Senator John McCain.


1764
01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:40.070
好  来了
Okay, here we go.


1765
01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:42.340
哥伦比亚广播公司快速民意调查显示
CBS instant poll says undecideds


1766
01:28:42.370 --> 01:28:46.310
46%调查对象认为拜登赢  佩林21%
give the debate to Biden, 46%; Palin, 21.


1767
01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:48.640
甭管他们那个破调查
Fuck CBS and fuck their instant poll.


1768
01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.280
这是共和党有史以来
This is the greatest debate victory


1769
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:51.680
最成功的辩论了
in the history of the Republic.


1770
01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:02.620
你看  只要做你自己就好了
You see? You just had to be you.


1771
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:06.230
我去拿杯啤酒
I'm gonna grab a beer.


1772
01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:08.790
-你要吗  -不用
- Want one? - No.


1773
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:12.630
参议员麦凯恩让我转达他对你的祝贺
Senator McCain wanted me to congratulate you


1774
01:29:12.670 --> 01:29:14.430
辩论很成功
on a fantastic debate.


1775
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:17.340
-讲得非常棒  -谢谢
- You really did a great job. - Thanks.


1776
01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:21.040
<b>奥巴马 瑞特牧师风波及亲近恐怖分子比尔·埃尔斯事件</b>

1777
01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:21.040
告诉他我想谈谈比尔·埃尔斯和瑞特牧师
Tell John I want to bring up Bill Ayers and Reverend Wright.


1778
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:23.410
我觉得是时候锁喉一击了
I think it's time to go for the jugular.


1779
01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.780
这个得和竞选伙伴商量
You'll have to discuss that with your running mate.


1780
01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:30.150
他明确地表示不想提到瑞特事件
He made it very clear that he doesn't want to touch Wright.


1781
01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:32.550
我会跟他说的
I'll talk to him about it.


1782
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:34.520
我们必须取胜
We have to win this thing.


1783
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:36.990
我不想再回阿拉斯加了
I so don't want to go back to Alaska.


1784
01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.760
斯蒂夫
Stevie.


1785
01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:48.530
我觉得最糟的已经过去了
You know, I think the worst of this thing might be over.


1786
01:29:48.570 --> 01:29:49.970
剩下的都是演讲了
All she's got left are speeches.


1787
01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.570
没有辩论  也没有重要的采访了
There's no more debates, no major interviews.


1788
01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:55.410
是  情形不错
Yeah. We're doing great.


1789
01:29:57.970 --> 01:30:01.480
莎拉·佩林不可思议地大获全胜
This was an unbelievable win for Sarah Palin.


1790
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:05.820
我认为  她高超的演说和沟通能力
In fact, I think that it unveiled a level of skill


1791
01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:08.650
自罗纳德·里根之后
in communication that I really have not seen


1792
01:30:08.690 --> 01:30:10.650
无人可及
since Ronald Reagan.


1793
01:30:10.690 --> 01:30:12.790
她是个超级明星
She is a superstar.


1794
01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:14.520
她的能力...
Her ability to by...


1795
01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.530
她无疑是政坛的一缕清风
And she sure is a breath of fresh air.


1796
01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:17.990
我认为民众想要个
I mean, I think people want


1797
01:30:18.030 --> 01:30:19.490
华盛顿政治圈外的人
someone from outside of Washington.


1798
01:30:19.530 --> 01:30:21.100
她代表着未来
She sounded like the future.


1799
01:30:21.130 --> 01:30:22.500
睡吧  宝贝
Come on, honey.


1800
01:30:22.530 --> 01:30:23.970
早点休息吧
Why don't you get some sleep?


1801
01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.830
就一会  好吗
One sec, okay?


1802
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:27.940
逆转了局势  她做到了
...Turned around. I think she has done it


1803
01:30:27.970 --> 01:30:30.910
且在我看来  4位辩手中
in the sense that of the four debaters we've seen,


1804
01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:34.010
她最有意思  最吸引人
she was the most interesting, attractive of them all.


1805
01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.740
-她很平易近人...  -还是有胜算的
- She is personable... - I can still win this thing.


1806
01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:38.250
...她很有幽默感
...She's got a sense of humor.


1807
01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.750
乔一直只对着格温说话
She looked straight into the camera


1808
01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:42.350
她却直视镜头
while Joe's talking to Gwen...


1809
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:48.620
投票局势现倾向于奥巴马
This map is now lopsided in favor of Barack Obama.


1810
01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:56.500
<b>270票之争  奥巴马250  麦凯恩189</b>

1811
01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.260
约翰·麦凯恩放弃了密西根
John McCain pulling out of Michigan.


1812
01:30:50.290 --> 01:30:52.630
走向经济竞选的第一步
The first domino in an economic debate


1813
01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:54.890
而若约翰·麦凯恩再不扭转局势
that if John McCain does not turn around soon,


1814
01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:56.560
这张图上会有更多蓝色
we may see more blue on this map


1815
01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.160
而约翰·麦凯恩也就麻烦大了
and more trouble for John McCain.


1816
01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.870
昨天竞选团队宣称放弃密西根
Yesterday, it was announced that the campaign


1817
01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:01.670
把该州选票拱手让给奥巴马
is going to leave Michigan to Obama to win.


1818
01:31:01.700 --> 01:31:03.940
-解释一下怎么回事  -我也今早才得知
- What's going on there? - I read that this morning also,


1819
01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:05.400
我立马就发了邮件
and I fired off a quick e-mail


1820
01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.370
说  "拜托  不退出不行吗"
and I said, "Oh, come on! Do we have to?"


1821
01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:09.110
"我们真得放弃吗"
"Do we have to call it there?"


1822
01:31:09.140 --> 01:31:11.980
我想回到密西根  我想尽力一试
I want to go back to Michigan, and I want to try.


1823
01:31:12.010 --> 01:31:13.880
怎么回事
What the fuck?


1824
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:15.650
麦凯恩本来只打算路过拉几张票
McCain had hoped to just score a pick-up.


1825
01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:18.120
我们决定停止密西根州的竞选宣传
We made the decision to pull the ads out of Michigan


1826
01:31:18.150 --> 01:31:19.580
因为那里没有胜算
because we can't win there.


1827
01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:22.190
我们需要把钱投入到宾州和俄亥俄州
We need the money in Pennsylvania and Ohio.


1828
01:31:22.190 --> 01:31:24.290
你这是大错特错了
You're making a big mistake.


1829
01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:26.490
虽说我不是专家
You know, I know I'm not an expert like yourself,


1830
01:31:26.530 --> 01:31:28.960
但既然我们落后了7个百分点
but seeing as we're seven points out,


1831
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:31.060
我不明白为什么副总统竞选
I don't see why the vice presidential campaign


1832
01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:32.600
半夜路过密西根时
can't make a quick stop there


1833
01:31:32.630 --> 01:31:34.000
不能顺道造访一下
in the middle of the night.


1834
01:31:34.030 --> 01:31:35.400
那你打算去见谁
And who are you gonna meet with?


1835
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:36.900
你的新闻团队
Your press corps doesn't want


1836
01:31:36.930 --> 01:31:39.240
不会半夜3点听你演讲的
to hear you speak at 3:00 in the morning.


1837
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:42.170
再说也没有什么副总统竞选
And there's no such thing as a vice presidential campaign.


1838
01:31:42.210 --> 01:31:44.070
只有约翰·麦凯恩的总统竞选
This is John McCain's campaign,


1839
01:31:44.110 --> 01:31:46.910
而决定也是约翰·麦凯恩做的
and this is the decision that John McCain has made.


1840
01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:49.780
你得按计划来  州长
You must stick to the script, Governor.


1841
01:31:49.810 --> 01:31:52.550
什么计划  斯蒂夫
And what script is that, Steve?


1842
01:31:52.580 --> 01:31:54.320
我从加盟你们这竞选团队来
'Cause I haven't seen anything resembling


1843
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:58.490
就没看到过什么计划
a script this entire flippin' campaign.


1844
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:57.490
对麦凯恩不利

1845
01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:01.020
你公开反驳约翰·麦凯恩
When you publicly contradict John McCain,


1846
01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:02.560
会有害于他的竞选
you hurt John McCain.


1847
01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:06.030
我知道我知道些什么
I know what I know what I know.


1848
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:11.670
看见了吧
And there you have it.


1849
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.140
午安  州长
Afternoon, Governor.


1850
01:32:16.170 --> 01:32:18.310
这广告是支持干细胞研究的
This is a pro-stem cell ad?


1851
01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:20.710
是的州长  参议员支持干细胞研究
Yes, Governor. That's the Senator's position.


1852
01:32:20.740 --> 01:32:23.610
但我不支持  我不说
Yeah, it's not my position. I'm not saying it.


1853
01:32:23.650 --> 01:32:24.950
我以为
I thought that...


1854
01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:27.380
你们该把剧本提前给我
You guys should have shown me the script ahead of time.


1855
01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:30.220
真是浪费生命
This is a waste of my time.


1856
01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:34.720
为什么没有人告诉我
Why wasn't I informed that Jeb Bradley


1857
01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.320
杰博·布拉德利会和我一同出席集会
is appearing with me at the rally?


1858
01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:38.160
我们没觉得这是个问题
I don't think we foresaw that being a problem.


1859
01:32:38.190 --> 01:32:40.760
我查了下  他支持堕胎
I just googled him. He's pro-choice.


1860
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:45.730
我绝不和支持堕胎的人站在一起
There's no way I'm going onstage with anyone who's pro-choice.


1861
01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:48.330
有他没我  没商量
Bradley's gone or I'm gone, period.


1862
01:32:48.370 --> 01:32:49.600
是的  州长
Yes, Governor.


1863
01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:53.440
联邦选举委员会报告指出
The RNC spent a stunning $150,000


1864
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:56.410
共和党花费了15万美元
on clothes for Governor Sarah Palin and her family


1865
01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.140
为州长莎拉·佩林及家人购置服装
according to the Federal Election Commission reports.


1866
01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:01.110
在诸如内曼·马库斯
The revelation that so much money


1867
01:32:59.180 --> 01:33:05.280
<b>奢侈高端精品百货店</b>

1868
01:33:01.150 --> 01:33:03.050
和萨克斯第五大道精品百货店
was spent at fancy clothing stores


1869
01:33:03.080 --> 01:33:05.280
等高档服饰店一掷千金
like Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue


1870
01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:07.550
无疑会严重损害州长
could be a huge blow to the Governor's image


1871
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:09.320
<b>共和党花费15万元为莎拉·佩林置装</b>

1872
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:10.120
平易近人的形象
as an everyday, average American.


1873
01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.960
共和党几位赞助者
Several Republican donors


1874
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:13.860
已经公开的表达了愤慨
have publicly expressed outrage...


1875
01:33:13.890 --> 01:33:16.630
-你看了吗  -是  在看
- You watching this? - Yeah, I'm watching.


1876
01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:18.260
太他妈的难以置信了
Un-fucking-believable.


1877
01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:20.030
你们为什么不告诉我
Why didn't you people tell me


1878
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:21.330
这些衣服这么贵
these clothes cost this much?


1879
01:33:21.370 --> 01:33:23.100
不只是你的衣服  州长
It wasn't just your clothes, Governor.


1880
01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:25.640
还有孩子们的  托德和你父母的
It was also for the kids, Todd and your parents.


1881
01:33:25.670 --> 01:33:27.300
都拿走
I want 'em gone.


1882
01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:29.540
我不想要
Get 'em out of here.


1883
01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:32.480
我都是在寄卖店买衣服的
You know, I buy my clothes at consignment shops.


1884
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:36.150
我从来也不想要这些花里胡哨的衣服
I never wanted this fancy crap in the first place.


1885
01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:37.880
你好  很感谢你能来
Hey, thanks for coming out.


1886
01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:39.820
你好  你好  很高兴见到你
Hey. Hi, nice to meet you.


1887
01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:42.320
-你怎么样  你好啊  -佩林州长
- How are you? Hey, hi. - Governor Palin,


1888
01:33:42.350 --> 01:33:43.920
阿拉斯加州议会报告
what's your response to the findings


1889
01:33:43.950 --> 01:33:45.590
指出你参与州警们事件
that the Alaska state legislature's report


1890
01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:47.320
你对此作何回应
on your involvement in the Troopergate scandal?


1891
01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:49.560
我很高兴那份报告能还我清白
I was thrilled to be cleared of all wrongdoing.


1892
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:51.230
你不该在这里
You know you're not supposed to be here.


1893
01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:53.900
请回到记者席  谢谢
Go back to the press risers, please. Thank you.


1894
01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:56.730
你不能说报告还你清白了
You can't say you were cleared of all wrongdoing.


1895
01:33:56.770 --> 01:33:58.870
-为什么  -因为它没有
- Why not? - Because you weren't.


1896
01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:01.770
那份报告说你滥用职权
The report stated that you abused your power.


1897
01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:04.440
和还你清白正相反
That is the opposite of being cleared of all wrongdoing.


1898
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:06.080
那为什么别人说我清白了
Then why was I told otherwise?


1899
01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.110
没人这么告诉你
You weren't told otherwise.


1900
01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:08.310
你们怎么还不发表声明
And why haven't you released a statement


1901
01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:09.810
托德从来不是
saying that Todd was never a member


1902
01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.080
阿拉斯加独立党成员
of the Alaska Independence Party?


1903
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:14.410
因为那不是事实  他是独立党成员
Because that would be untrue. He was a member.


1904
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:16.250
他选错选项了
He checked the wrong box.


1905
01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:17.820
他无意中注册的
He registered by accident,


1906
01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:19.850
并立马改正了错误
and rectified the error immediately.


1907
01:34:19.890 --> 01:34:21.690
他注册独立党7年了
He was a member for seven years!


1908
01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:24.130
抱歉  州长  但是...
I'm sorry, Governor, but...


1909
01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.190
竞选已经接近尾声了
There is only a few weeks left in this campaign.


1910
01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:28.360
这几星期内  你不能再这么
You have got to stop saying things to the press


1911
01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.800
公开欺骗媒体了
that are blatantly untrue.


1912
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:32.430
我们的竞选不能像这样下去
That is not the kind of campaign that we are running here.


1913
01:34:32.470 --> 01:34:35.670
"竞选"  你管这个叫竞选吗
"Campaign", is that what you're calling this now?


1914
01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:38.840
州长  我知道这个竞选团运作有点混乱
Governor, I admit that this is a dysfunctional campaign,


1915
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:40.310
但我接手时就是这样
but that is what I inherited,


1916
01:34:40.340 --> 01:34:43.280
而我正在尽全力帮我们赢得竞选
and I am doing my level best to help us win this election.


1917
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:44.840
我也在尽力  斯蒂夫
And that's what I'm trying to do, too, Steve


1918
01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.440
而你就是在拖我后腿
and all you're doing is screwing me up.


1919
01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:49.380
你一直以来就是给我捣乱
That's all you've done this entire time, is get in my way.


1920
01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:54.520
而且我给这个竞选筹得了几百万的资金
And I am raising millions of dollars for this campaign.


1921
01:34:54.550 --> 01:34:56.350
上千万的人赶来
Hundreds of thousands of people are coming


1922
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:58.420
看我演讲的  而不是看约翰·麦凯恩
to see me speak, not John McCain, God bless him.


1923
01:34:58.460 --> 01:34:59.820
他们是来看我的
They are coming to see me.


1924
01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:04.130
既然是我撑起了这个"竞选"
So if I am single-handedly carrying this "campaign",


1925
01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:06.360
我想做什么就做什么
I'm gonna do what I want.


1926
01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:21.640
莎拉  莎拉
Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!


1927
01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:30.690
麦凯恩团队几位顾问向CNN透露说
Several McCain advisors tell CNN they're annoyed


1928
01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.890
他们对"不受约束的佩林"感到很反感
by what one aide called "Palin going rogue."


1929
01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:36.090
该死的
God damn it.


1930
01:35:36.130 --> 01:35:37.830
竞选没结束就有泄密和恶意中伤了
I hate it when there's leaking and backstabbing


1931
01:35:37.860 --> 01:35:41.060
结束后的中伤我都恨之入骨呢
after a campaign, let alone before it's fucking over.


1932
01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:44.030
你得出面去跟她谈谈
I need you to step in and talk to her.


1933
01:35:44.070 --> 01:35:47.340
算了吧  斯蒂夫
I don't know, Stevie boy. I don't know.


1934
01:35:47.370 --> 01:35:50.170
先生
Sir...


1935
01:35:50.210 --> 01:35:52.510
我控制不了她了
I can't control her any more.


1936
01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:57.810
我都不知道她早上是否有心情上飞机
I don't know if she's getting on a campaign plane


1937
01:35:57.850 --> 01:35:59.910
也不知道她晚上讲话会说什么
in the morning or what she's gonna say at night.


1938
01:35:59.950 --> 01:36:02.920
我们得以尽可能高雅的姿态
We need to finish this campaign


1939
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:04.890
完成整个竞选
with as much dignity as possible,


1940
01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.650
我们要做到这一点
and the only way that can happen


1941
01:36:06.690 --> 01:36:08.560
就得让她守规矩
is if you get her in line.


1942
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:13.730
我说也没用  斯蒂夫
That's not gonna do it, Steve.


1943
01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:16.360
她可能会直接跟我对着干
She might start turning on me.


1944
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:30.610
大部分民意调查指出我们落后
Most of these polls have us trailing


1945
01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:32.610
5到8个百分点
five to eight points.


1946
01:36:32.650 --> 01:36:35.010
-那现在怎么办  -约翰
- So what now? - John...


1947
01:36:35.050 --> 01:36:37.050
这些数字很明显了
I mean, these numbers do show it.


1948
01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:39.720
我们得开始针对奥巴马了
We've got to make this about Obama.


1949
01:36:39.750 --> 01:36:41.290
得开始攻击他
We've got to get tough


1950
01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:43.220
开始负面竞选了
and we've got to get negative.


1951
01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.260
如果这样
If we go this way,


1952
01:36:45.290 --> 01:36:49.160
瑞特牧师是我们手上最好的牌了
Reverend Wright is still the best play we have.


1953
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:53.230
你们谁被指控过
Any of you ever been accused


1954
01:36:50.330 --> 01:37:00.330
<b>麦凯恩最小的女儿布里吉特领养自孟加拉国

1955
01:36:53.270 --> 01:36:57.630
你的黑鬼孩子是私生女吗
of having a negro child out of wedlock


1956
01:36:57.670 --> 01:37:01.370
就因为你的养女是孟加拉裔
because your adopted daughter was born in Bangladesh?


1957
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:03.870
在她16岁时
And then when she was 16


1958
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:07.240
在谷歌上搜了自己的名字  我得给她解释
and googled her name, I had to explain to her


1959
01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:10.950
为什么她10岁的时候  布什总统的二把手
why President Bush's henchmen called her a bastard


1960
01:37:10.980 --> 01:37:13.520
就骂她是私生子
when she was 10 years old.


1961
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:16.820
听我说  南卡州的初选是挺恶心的
Yeah, listen, South Carolina-- that was an ugly primary,


1962
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:18.320
但这不是一码事
but this isn't the same thing.


1963
01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.860
瑞特牧师的确说了那些话
I mean, Reverend Wright really did say those things.


1964
01:37:20.890 --> 01:37:23.330
那也许是事实
That may be true.


1965
01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:26.900
但美国民众心里也有阴暗面
But there is a dark side to American populism.


1966
01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:30.200
有些人靠伎俩赢得选举
Some people win elections by tapping into it.


1967
01:37:31.970 --> 01:37:34.740
我不会这么做
I'm not one of those people.


1968
01:37:34.770 --> 01:37:39.110
好吧  比尔·埃尔斯怎么样
Okay. So what about Bill Ayers?


1969
01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:41.110
奥巴马的政途
Obama began his career


1970
01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:43.340
始于国内恐怖分子的起居室
in the living room of a domestic terrorist.


1971
01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:47.110
国内恐怖分子  和种族无关
Domestic terrorist. Nothing to do with race.


1972
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:54.720
好吧
Yeah, okay.


1973
01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.190
埃尔斯可以用
Ayers is fair.


1974
01:37:57.230 --> 01:37:59.690
好吧  谁来说
Okay. Who should do this?


1975
01:37:59.730 --> 01:38:02.360
巴拉克政途的首次会议
And Barack held one of the first meetings


1976
01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:06.430
是在比尔·埃尔斯的起居室开的
of his political career in Bill Ayers' living room.


1977
01:38:08.740 --> 01:38:11.640
和恐怖分子打成一团
Pallin' around with terrorists.


1978
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:15.070
他不是基督徒
He's not a Christian!


1979
01:38:15.110 --> 01:38:17.810
我很忧心
And I am just so fearful


1980
01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:20.180
这一位候选人
that this is not a man


1981
01:38:20.210 --> 01:38:22.810
对美国的看法
who sees America


1982
01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:26.820
与你我都不同
the way that you and I see America...


1983
01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:27.420
他搞共产主义
He's a socialist!


1984
01:38:27.450 --> 01:38:33.460
而我们把美国看做世界上善良的源泉
...as the greatest source for good in this world.


1985
01:38:36.230 --> 01:38:38.560
美利坚  美利坚
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!


1986
01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:41.330
美利坚  美利坚
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!


1987
01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:44.230
巴拉克·奥巴马为美国做了什么打算
What does Barack Obama plan for America?


1988
01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:44.230
<b>我们要一个真正的美国人做总统</b>

1989
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:46.440
没有
Nothing!


1990
01:38:46.470 --> 01:38:49.970
总结下  奥巴马到底是什么人
In short, who is the real Barack Obama?


1991
01:38:50.010 --> 01:38:53.110
恐怖分子
A terrorist!


1992
01:38:53.140 --> 01:38:54.980
我们相信  美国的精英
We believe that the best of America


1993
01:38:55.010 --> 01:38:58.510
不全在华盛顿  我们相信
is not all in Washington, D. C. We believe--


1994
01:39:02.450 --> 01:39:05.720
我们相信美国的精髓
we believe that the best of America


1995
01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:08.760
正是在我们到的这些小镇里
is in these small towns that we get to visit


1996
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:11.160
这些美丽的小地方
and in these wonderful little pockets


1997
01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:13.530
才是真正的美国
of what I call the real America.


1998
01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.260
说得好
Yes!


1999
01:39:17.170 --> 01:39:20.700
萨拉  萨拉
Sarah! Sarah!


2000
01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:28.310
作为写了两本传记的人
For a man who's written two memoirs,


2001
01:39:28.340 --> 01:39:29.810
他可不是那么好看懂的
he's no open book.


2002
01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.350
这你可说对了
You got that right.


2003
01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:34.880
巴拉克·奥巴马想为美国做什么
What does Barack Obama see for America?


2004
01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.380
他是个穆斯林
He's a Muslim!


2005
01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:37.920
他搞社会主义
He's a socialist!


2006
01:39:37.950 --> 01:39:40.320
-他不能代表我们  -他不属于这里
- He doesn't represent us! - He doesn't belong here!


2007
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:42.690
他和痛恨我们国家的人在一起混
He hangs out with people who hate our country.


2008
01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:45.560
-他不是美国人  -杀了他
- He's not American! - Kill him!


2009
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:49.130
把他赶回非洲去
Send him back to Africa!


2010
01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:50.960
塔拉  我给你读一下
Let me read to you, Tara,


2011
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.870
约翰·路易斯众议员  民权偶像人物
what Congressman John Lewis, the civil rights icon,


2012
01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:56.370
在周六发表的声明
said on Saturday in a statement.


2013
01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:58.940
他说  作为一位在民权运动高峰
He said, "As one who was a victim of violence"


2014
01:39:58.970 --> 01:40:01.210
历经暴力与憎恨的人
and hate during the height of the civil rights movement,


2015
01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:03.310
我很担忧目前来自麦凯恩-佩林阵营
I am deeply disturbed by the negative tone


2016
01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:05.310
的负面声音
of the McCain-Palin campaign.


2017
01:40:05.350 --> 01:40:07.350
麦凯恩参议员与佩林州长
Senator McCain and Governor Palin"...


2018
01:40:07.380 --> 01:40:09.180
我们不能再这么骂他了
We gotta tone the rhetoric down.


2019
01:40:09.220 --> 01:40:11.120
要失去控制了
It's gotten out of control.


2020
01:40:11.150 --> 01:40:14.790
我们都不能提奥巴马的名字了
We can't even mention Obama's name any more.


2021
01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:16.820
不然要群情激奋了
The crowd gets too hot.


2022
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:22.890
我不想这样竞选
This isn't the campaign I wanted to run.


2023
01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.560
我无法相信奥巴马
I can't trust Obama.


2024
01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:28.900
我读过关于他的事  他不是...
I've read about him, and he's not a--


2025
01:40:28.930 --> 01:40:31.300
他是...他是阿拉伯人
he's a-- he's an Arab.


2026
01:40:31.340 --> 01:40:32.900
他都算不上美国...
He's not an Amer--


2027
01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:35.310
不  您错了
No, Ma'am.


2028
01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:36.740
您说错了
No, Ma'am.


2029
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:39.810
他是有家庭的正直的男人
He's a decent family-man citizen


2030
01:40:39.840 --> 01:40:41.980
我与他不过是在一些方面
who I just happen to have disagreements with


2031
01:40:42.010 --> 01:40:44.350
政见不合而已
on certain fundamental issues.


2032
01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:47.480
此次竞选也正是为此  并无其他
And that's what this campaign is all about.


2033
01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:50.250
他是个好人  谢谢您
He's not. Thank you.


2034
01:40:51.550 --> 01:40:53.120
从今晚的大好局势来看
Cutting through the bull tonight,


2035
01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:57.820
凤凰城

2036
01:40:53.070 --> 01:40:57.820
11月3日

2037
01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.660
在大选前夕
on the eve of the election,


2038
01:40:54.690 --> 01:40:57.360
双方都在赌自己的运气
the campaigns are relying on their lucky charms.


2039
01:40:57.390 --> 01:40:59.400
来杯加冰的伏特加  配莱姆汁
Vodka rocks, lime.


2040
01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:00.900
稍等  这就好
You got it.


2041
01:41:00.930 --> 01:41:02.360
他还好吗
How's he doing?


2042
01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:05.870
自竞选以来  我从没看到他如此沮丧过
He's the most depressed I've seen him the entire campaign.


2043
01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:09.000
我都没法让他别看MSNBC
I can't get him to stop watching MSNBC,


2044
01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.340
他越看心里越不爽
which only makes him more miserable.


2045
01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:16.510
我很惊讶他这样的政坛老手
I'm amazed that someone who has been in politics


2046
01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:19.250
也会把这些琐碎的小事
this long takes all the petty stuff


2047
01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:20.810
放在心上
so personally.


2048
01:41:20.850 --> 01:41:23.550
也正是这种性格成就了他们
And that's why they are who they are.


2049
01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:25.420
里根  布什  克林顿  都是如此
that's Reagan, Bush, Clinton--


2050
01:41:25.450 --> 01:41:27.720
他们期望讨所有人的欢心
all they want is to be loved.


2051
01:41:27.760 --> 01:41:30.460
对于民众的爱无欲无求的人
The ones that don't pathologically need to be loved,


2052
01:41:30.490 --> 01:41:32.120
无法成为总统候选人
they don't get the nomination.


2053
01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.730
也无法成为总统
They don't get to be President.


2054
01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.330
你要是早知道这点
If you'd understood that fact,


2055
01:41:35.360 --> 01:41:36.420
说不定你就有本事
you might have been able


2056
01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:38.260
驾驭这位阿拉斯加的麋鹿猎手
to better handle our Alaskan moose hunter.


2057
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:42.570
我的天  这真是一场艰难的竞选
God, it was a tough campaign.


2058
01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.600
这不是竞选  这是一场糟糕的真人秀
It wasn't a campaign, it was a bad reality show.


2059
01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:47.770
她并没有拉低我们的选票
She didn't cost us the election.


2060
01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:50.740
布什  经济状况  这些才是问题关键
That was Bush. That was the economy.


2061
01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:53.040
命数已定
That was just the cold hand of fate.


2062
01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:55.150
我们已经没有机会了
We didn't have a chance.


2063
01:41:55.180 --> 01:41:56.950
如果我们胜选的话
And if we did win,


2064
01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:00.650
你能接受佩林总统么
would you feel comfortable with President Palin?


2065
01:42:00.690 --> 01:42:02.550
当然可以  要能接受不就赢了
Why not? Then we would have won.


2066
01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:05.820
听着  伙计们
Come on, guys, listen.


2067
01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:08.360
我也希望美国公民能够选出下一位
I, too, wish that the American people


2068
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:10.560
阿伯拉罕·林肯或
would choose the future Abraham Lincoln


2069
01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:12.960
下一位托马斯·杰弗逊  可不幸的是
or Thomas Jefferson, but unfortunately,


2070
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.760
游戏规则已经变了
that's not the way it works any more.


2071
01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:17.900
你现在得靠自己的
Now it takes movie star charisma


2072
01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:19.940
明星光环来赢得竞选
to get elected president.


2073
01:42:19.970 --> 01:42:23.940
奥巴马和佩林  他们就是明星
And Obama and Palin, that's what they are-- they're stars.


2074
01:42:23.970 --> 01:42:25.770
而他们的根本区别在于
Primary difference being


2075
01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:28.810
萨拉·佩林连个高等法院案例都说不出来
Sarah Palin can't name a supreme court decision,


2076
01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:31.050
而巴拉克·奥巴马
whereas Barack Obama


2077
01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:33.080
曾经是一位宪法教授
was a constitutional law Professor.


2078
01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:34.750
你去死吧
Fuck you.


2079
01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:41.320
你知道切尼那家伙知道
You know what Dick Cheney said


2080
01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.730
-我们选了她以后说啥了吗  -什么
- when he found out we picked her? - What?


2081
01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:47.030
他说我们太不计后果了
He said we made a reckless choice.


2082
01:42:47.060 --> 01:42:51.430
如果连切尼都开始觉得你有问题的话
When you lose the moral high ground to Dick Cheney,


2083
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:54.140
你真该好好反思人生了
it's time to re-think your entire life.


2084
01:42:54.170 --> 01:42:56.100
别再提切尼了行吗
Enough Cheney cracks, okay?


2085
01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:58.510
大家一直都误解他
I mean, he's very misunderstood.


2086
01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:00.010
我一直很费解
How does he eat when he's wearing


2087
01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.940
他怎么戴着黑武士的头盔吃东西呢
Darth Vader's helmet, anyway?


2088
01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:04.780
这样才对嘛
There we go.


2089
01:43:04.810 --> 01:43:07.310
伙计们  让我们祝彼此好运吧
Gentlemen, let's wish each other good luck.


2090
01:43:07.350 --> 01:43:09.520
天知道我们是不是要应对一场
Who knows, we could have another


2091
01:43:09.550 --> 01:43:11.480
杜威对垒杜鲁门式的竞选呢
Dewey-Truman situation here.


2092
01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:12.480
<b>在1948年的美国总统大选中  杜鲁门以微弱优势险胜杜威</b>

2093
01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:13.220
要郁闷以后有的是时间
Always room for an upset.


2094
01:43:13.250 --> 01:43:16.120
是啊  没准明早我会长出满头黑发
Yeah, maybe I'll wake up with a full head of hair.


2095
01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:22.400
如果我们一开始问了她政策问题的话
You know, if we had just asked for policy questions


2096
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:25.330
我们就能心里有数
in the briefing, then we would have known.


2097
01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:27.900
我以为库尔华豪斯会刁难她呢
I thought Culvahouse was gonna grill her during the vet.


2098
01:43:27.930 --> 01:43:30.540
库尔华豪斯还以为我们会刁难她呢
Culvahouse thought we were gonna grill her.


2099
01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:34.270
我非常纠结
It haunts me.


2100
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:40.340
在一场艰难的对垒之后
After a hard-fought battle,


2101
01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:43.310
有史以来持续时间最长的一次总统竞选
the nation's longest-running presidential race


2102
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:45.920
将在今天落下帷幕  选举日终于到来
comes down to this day-- election day.


2103
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:49.590
投票已经在48个州正式全面展开
Voting is now underway in all the lower 48 states


2104
01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:52.090
这场历史性选举的胜负即将见分晓
as we approach the end of this historic election.


2105
01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:54.490
数百万的美国人今天都走上了街头
People lined up across the country


2106
01:43:54.530 --> 01:43:56.260
排队等着投票
by the millions today.


2107
01:43:56.290 --> 01:43:58.730
这是近几十年来参与投票人数最多的一次
Turnout looks to be the highest in decades.


2108
01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:02.470
约翰·麦凯恩如期拿下了肯塔基州
John McCain will carry Kentucky once again, as expected.


2109
01:44:02.500 --> 01:44:05.900
共八张选举人票  我们对此并不意外
Eight electoral votes, not a huge surprise.


2110
01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:08.310
截止到目前为止  还有另外四个州的
We are not able to make a projection


2111
01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:10.370
投票已经全部结束
in the four other states...


2112
01:44:10.410 --> 01:44:12.680
但是我们还无法对这四个州的
that are closing all their polls


2113
01:44:12.710 --> 01:44:14.410
投票结果做出预测
at this hour right now.


2114
01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.480
这几个州也是竞选过程中竞争最为激烈的
And some of them are battleground states--


2115
01:44:16.510 --> 01:44:18.130
佐治亚州  印第安纳州
Georgia, Indiana,


2116
01:44:18.130 --> 01:44:19.820
南卡莱罗纳州和弗吉尼亚州
South Carolina and Virginia.


2117
01:44:19.850 --> 01:44:22.980
当然这并不意味选情会很胶着
It doesn't necessarily mean that it's gonna be close or not...


2118
01:44:23.020 --> 01:44:26.190
弗吉尼亚州情况如何
Where's Virginia?


2119
01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:30.090
落后五个点  俄亥俄州已经失选了
Negative five. And Ohio's gone.


2120
01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:31.990
-明白  -我会随时汇报给你
- Got it. - I'll keep you posted.


2121
01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:33.930
我过十分钟再打给你
Call you in 10.


2122
01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:36.560
怎么了
What's going on?


2123
01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:39.100
宾州要失选了
We're gonna lose Pennsylvania.


2124
01:44:39.130 --> 01:44:41.170
俄亥俄州也是
And Ohio.


2125
01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:44.800
斯蒂夫
Steve...


2126
01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:48.810
有件事我必须告诉你
There's something I have to tell you.


2127
01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:51.810
怎么了
What's wrong?


2128
01:44:51.850 --> 01:44:53.880
我没投票
I didn't vote.


2129
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:56.380
我做不到
I couldn't do it.


2130
01:44:56.420 --> 01:44:59.020
我没有投票
I didn't vote.


2131
01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:03.420
我真的做不到
I couldn't do it.


2132
01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:05.420
没关系
It's okay.


2133
01:45:05.460 --> 01:45:07.060
-孤独啊  -好的  我们接下来
- Soledad. - All right, wolf,


2134
01:45:07.090 --> 01:45:09.160
马上进行选民分析
we'll take you right to the voter analysis...


2135
01:45:11.060 --> 01:45:13.200
情况怎么样 斯蒂夫
How we doing, Stevie boy?


2136
01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:19.600
宾州和俄亥俄州已经失选了
We lost Pennsylvania and Ohio, sir.


2137
01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:45.860
当年我的祖父在听说日本已经投降之后
When my grandfather found out that the Japanese had surrendered,


2138
01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:47.660
他不知所措
he was lost.


2139
01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:51.070
他不知道自己接下来该怎么办
He didn't know what to do with himself.


2140
01:45:51.100 --> 01:45:53.740
他回到家里
He came home,


2141
01:45:53.770 --> 01:45:56.210
第二天便暴毙而亡
dropped dead the very next day.


2142
01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:02.680
全力战斗  慷慨赴死
Fought his war, then he died.


2143
01:46:04.210 --> 01:46:05.910
我的父亲
And my dad,


2144
01:46:05.950 --> 01:46:09.650
自他从海军退役后
when he retired from the Navy,


2145
01:46:09.690 --> 01:46:14.560
就陷入了深深的绝望
he fell into a sense of despair for the rest of his life.


2146
01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:23.960
我是不会放弃的  斯蒂夫
I'm never gonna quit, Steve.


2147
01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:27.070
我不能放弃
I can't.


2148
01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:32.470
我不知道应该怎样淡出政坛
I don't know how to just fade away.


2149
01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:38.010
参议员  我...
Senator, I--


2150
01:46:38.050 --> 01:46:40.050
我只想告诉您...
I just want to say--


2151
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:48.320
什么
What?


2152
01:46:50.690 --> 01:46:53.120
我...我...
I'm s-- I'm s--


2153
01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:55.490
我真的非常抱歉
I'm so sorry that I...


2154
01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:59.130
我举荐了她
suggested her.


2155
01:47:01.530 --> 01:47:03.240
不用愧疚
Don't be.


2156
01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:06.410
去他们的吧
Fuck 'em.


2157
01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:10.810
我们还能怎么办呢
What were we supposed to do?


2158
01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:13.780
今夜对于整个美国来说具有历史性的意义
A truly historic night here in the United States.


2159
01:47:13.810 --> 01:47:15.180
巴拉克·奥巴马
Barack Obama will become


2160
01:47:15.210 --> 01:47:17.380
将成为美国的第44任总统
the 44th President of the United States.


2161
01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:19.350
我很遗憾  妈妈
Sorry, mom.


2162
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:21.190
谢谢你  孩子
Oh, thanks, kiddo.


2163
01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:23.950
我真的非常遗憾  妈妈
I'm really sorry, mom.


2164
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:25.720
亲爱的
Sweetheart.


2165
01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:28.190
你知道吗  你真的棒极了
You did great. You know that, right?


2166
01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:31.500
宝宝快到妈妈这儿来
Come here, baby.


2167
01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:34.960
这没什么大不了的  我们会没事的
It's all right. We're okay. Yeah.


2168
01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:40.300
我想着重强调这一段
I'll take the stress very literally here.


2169
01:47:40.340 --> 01:47:42.470
就顺便提一句  你觉得呢
Just one quick-- you think?


2170
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:45.410
还有接下来这个部分  麻烦用粗体标明
And on this next part, would you make sure you bold that?


2171
01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:48.580
克里斯  帮我把这个输入到提词器里去
Oh, Chris, I need you to load this in the teleprompter for me.


2172
01:47:48.610 --> 01:47:50.380
斯蒂夫·施密特说你不用发表演说
Steve Schmidt told me you weren't making a speech.


2173
01:47:50.410 --> 01:47:54.150
不  我要发表演说
No. I am making a speech.


2174
01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:55.720
斯库里已经跟里克·戴维斯说好了
Scully cleared it with Rick Davis.


2175
01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:57.550
快点帮我输入到提词器里去  好吗
So just go ahead and load it, okay?


2176
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:59.520
好的
Okay.


2177
01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:06.730
好的  记得着重强调这一点
Okay, so, on the stress on this one, I'll take it.


2178
01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:08.900
-天哪  -抱歉
- Jesus! - Hey, sorry.


2179
01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:11.000
斯蒂夫  我现在有点混乱
Steve, I'm getting a bunch of mixed messages here.


2180
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:13.030
州长她到底要不要做败选演讲呢
Is the Governor giving a concession speech or not--


2181
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:15.700
我已经说过五遍了
I've already said this five times already.


2182
01:48:15.740 --> 01:48:17.500
她不需要做演讲
She is not giving a speech.


2183
01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:19.070
她好像并不这么认为
Well, she seems to think otherwise.


2184
01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:21.110
轮不到她说话
Well, she's not.


2185
01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:22.740
那你希望我怎么跟她说呢
What do you want me to tell her?


2186
01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:25.510
就跟她说她用不着上台演讲
Tell her she's not fucking speaking!


2187
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:27.250
可是你们俩都挺有决心的...
Okay, well, you both seem pretty certain--


2188
01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:30.020
我的决心大于她的决心
well, let my certainty supersede her certainty.


2189
01:48:30.050 --> 01:48:31.550
该死的
God damn it!


2190
01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:37.560
斯蒂夫
Steve.


2191
01:48:37.590 --> 01:48:39.560
你要见我吗
You want to see me?


2192
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:41.430
是的  这边请
Yes. This way.


2193
01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:51.470
抱歉
Excuse us a moment.


2194
01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:02.010
我听说你准备发表演说
I understand you've prepared a speech. Is that correct?


2195
01:49:02.050 --> 01:49:04.250
是的  我想对约翰为这个国家
Yes, I have. I want to salute John


2196
01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:06.250
所做的一切致以敬意
for everything he's done for this country.


2197
01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:10.090
不行  你不能上台做演讲
It's not going to happen. You're not giving a speech.


2198
01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:11.860
为什么呢  斯蒂夫
And why is that, Steve?


2199
01:49:11.890 --> 01:49:13.290
你不能上台演讲
You're not giving a speech


2200
01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:15.260
因为副总统的候选人从未
because the vice presidential candidate


2201
01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:19.200
在选举日当晚做败选演讲
has never given a concession speech on election night.


2202
01:49:19.230 --> 01:49:21.100
选举结束不是关于你
It's not about you.


2203
01:49:21.130 --> 01:49:23.470
而是关于整个国家
It's about the country.


2204
01:49:23.500 --> 01:49:26.400
可是凡事总有第一次
Yeah, well, there's a lot of things never been done before.


2205
01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:30.070
州长同志
Governor...


2206
01:49:30.110 --> 01:49:31.910
就在今天  美国选出了
This country has just elected the first


2207
01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:36.340
历史上第一位黑人总统
African- American president in the history of its existence.


2208
01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:38.280
这场败选演讲
And it is the concession speech


2209
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:42.180
将正式承认结果的合法性
that will legitimize his succession as commander in chief.


2210
01:49:42.220 --> 01:49:44.690
这场演讲异常庄重严肃
It is a serious and solemn occasion,


2211
01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:47.150
约翰·麦凯恩  只有约翰·麦凯恩
and John McCain, and only John McCain,


2212
01:49:47.190 --> 01:49:50.220
才有资格发表这个演讲
will be giving this sacred speech.


2213
01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:51.730
自美利坚合众国成立的那一刻起
This is how it has been done in every presidential election


2214
01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:55.530
总统竞选的规则就是如此
in every presidential election since the dawn of the Republic,


2215
01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:57.360
而你  萨拉·佩林
and you, Sarah Palin,


2216
01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.300
你对于这一伟大的美国传统
will not change the importance


2217
01:49:59.330 --> 01:50:03.340
只能遵守  不能改变
of this proud American tradition.


2218
01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:18.750
"我们已经尽了全力去战斗"
"We fought-- we fought as hard as we could."


2219
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:20.390
"虽然最终结果令我们矮人一头"
"And though we feel short,"


2220
01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:22.660
"但这只是我的失败"
"The fail-- the failure is mine."


2221
01:50:22.690 --> 01:50:24.790
老天  别这么说...
Oh, jeez, no--


2222
01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:26.530
马克  我并没觉得我矮啊
I don't feel that short, Mark.


2223
01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:28.730
"深感惭愧"  老大
"Fell short," Boss.


2224
01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:30.420
是啊  真是多谢了
Yeah, thanks.


2225
01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:31.230
"深感惭愧"  打错了
"Fell short." It's a typo.


2226
01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:35.130
-约翰  -萨拉
- John. - Hi, Sarah.


2227
01:50:36.740 --> 01:50:39.970
我们虽败犹荣
Well, we fought the good fight.


2228
01:50:40.010 --> 01:50:42.610
没错
Mm-hmm, we did.


2229
01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:45.980
现在让我去好好感谢一下我们的国家吧
Now I'm just gonna get out there and thank America.


2230
01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:48.480
我已经等不及要对你献上我崇高的敬意了
I can't wait to get out there and thank you.


2231
01:50:48.510 --> 01:50:52.420
我为你写了一份发自肺腑的颂词
I have a speech written that is a real tribute to ya.


2232
01:50:52.450 --> 01:50:56.350
不用了  我想他们已经安排好了
No, I think these guys have that covered.


2233
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:57.690
对吗  斯蒂夫
Right, Steve?


2234
01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.220
是的  我们已经搞定了
Yes, sir. We have it covered.


2235
01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:02.320
我只是想让大家都看看你是一个多棒的人
I just wanted people to know what a great man you are.


2236
01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.960
谢谢你
I appreciate that,


2237
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:06.300
但是他们已经安排好了
but these guys got it all worked out.


2238
01:51:06.330 --> 01:51:10.300
我们该走了  先生
Yeah, you know, we probably should get going now, sir, so...


2239
01:51:10.330 --> 01:51:12.000
好的
All right. Good.


2240
01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:16.710
那我们过会儿见了
Okay. We'll see you afterwards.


2241
01:51:16.710 --> 01:51:17.610
期待你精彩的演讲
I'll see you out there.


2242
01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:33.020
你现在已经是共和党的领袖了  萨拉
You're one of the leaders of the party now, Sarah.


2243
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:37.420
你不能被像林博这样的极端分子打倒
Don't get co-opted by Limbaugh and the other extremists.


2244
01:51:37.460 --> 01:51:40.560
一旦你退让  他们将会毁掉整个政党
They'll destroy the party if you let them.


2245
01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.800
别忘了  你是个冰球妈妈
Remember, you're a hockey mom.


2246
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:45.930
你只不过是想做出一些改变
You just wanted to make a difference,


2247
01:51:45.970 --> 01:51:47.900
而你的确做到了
and you did.


2248
01:51:47.940 --> 01:51:49.300
你为我们带来了一场巨大的变革
A big, huge difference.


2249
01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:51.800
为此我将永远心怀感激  谢谢你
I'll always be grateful. Thank you.


2250
01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.940
-该走了  先生  -谢谢你  约翰
- We should go, sir. - Thank you, John.


2251
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:08.650
我亲爱的朋友们  我们...
My friends, we have--


2252
01:52:08.690 --> 01:52:10.960
我们已经携手走到了这段征程的尽头
we have come to the end of a long journey.


2253
01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:16.130
美国人民发出了自己的声音
The American people have spoken,


2254
01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:18.500
这声音是如此的清晰响亮
and they have spoken clearly.


2255
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:20.400
就在刚才  很荣幸
A little while ago, I had the honor


2256
01:52:20.430 --> 01:52:22.530
我给巴拉克·奥巴马参议员打了个电话
of calling Senator Barack Obama...


2257
01:52:22.570 --> 01:52:24.600
向他...
to congrat--


2258
01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:26.740
别这样
please.


2259
01:52:26.770 --> 01:52:28.670
向他当选为我们彼此都深爱的美国的
To congratulate him on being elected


2260
01:52:28.710 --> 01:52:31.110
下一任总统而表示祝贺
the next president of the country we both love.


2261
01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:38.750
不管我们之前有什么分歧
Whatever our differences,


2262
01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:40.920
我们都同为美国人
we are fellow Americans.


2263
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:43.950
您说的对
Yes, sir!


2264
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:46.820
你们对我的支持  你们为我所做的一切
I am so deeply grateful to all of you


2265
01:52:46.860 --> 01:52:50.790
我将永远铭记在心  并心怀感激
for the great honor of your support and all you have done for me.


2266
01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:54.960
当然
I am also, of course,


2267
01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.800
我还想对萨拉·佩林州长表示由衷的感谢
very thankful to Governor Sarah Palin,


2268
01:52:57.830 --> 01:53:00.570
她是我见过的最好的竞选人之一
one of the best campaigners I have ever seen.


2269
01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:07.310
你还是认为她能胜任吗
Still think she's fit for office?


2270
01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:08.540
谁在乎呢
Eh, who cares?


2271
01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:10.780
48个小时之后  没有人会记得她是谁
In 48 hours, no one will even remember who she is.


2272
01:53:10.810 --> 01:53:13.220
我们期待她在阿拉斯加州能大展拳脚
We can all look forward with great interest


2273
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:15.250
也期待她能为共和党  为整个国家
to her future service to Alaska,


2274
01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:18.720
做出更大的贡献
the Republican party and our country.


2275
01:53:26.930 --> 01:53:30.960
萨拉  萨拉  萨拉
Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!


2276
01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:50.410
她确实犯过不少错误
There were numerous instances of her saying things


2277
01:53:50.410 --> 01:53:53.840
这些错误不仅会让人质疑她的诚信
that were not accurate that opened the door to criticism


2278
01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:56.660
也将授予那些批评她的人以话柄
that she was being untruthful and inaccurate.


2279
01:53:56.690 --> 01:54:00.760
我认为她现在仍然在继续这种错误
And I think that is something that continues to this day.


2280
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:02.330
你认为那些批评都是公正的吗
And you think that's fair criticism?


2281
01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:04.060
是  我认为那些批评是公正的
I think that's fair criticism.


2282
01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:07.300
可是早前你就说过她什么都不懂
Early on, though, you apparently said she doesn't know anything.


2283
01:54:07.330 --> 01:54:10.140
在她参选之后
In the immediate aftermath of her selection,


2284
01:54:10.170 --> 01:54:13.840
我们很快就发现...
it was clear to us that we...


2285
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:15.740
发现我们有很多工作要做
had a lot of work to do.


2286
01:54:15.770 --> 01:54:19.170
对你而言  选择萨拉·佩林是考虑赢得选举
For you, picking Sarah Palin was about winning an election,


2287
01:54:19.170 --> 01:54:21.280
而不是考虑
not necessarily about


2288
01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:23.290
副总统的最佳人选
who's gonna be best as vice president.


2289
01:54:23.290 --> 01:54:26.600
我的职责是提出政治建议
My job is to give political advice.


2290
01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:28.520
为了赢得选举  
We needed to do something bold


2291
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:30.490
需要兵行险招
to try to win the race.


2292
01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:32.590
如果能重新来过
If you had it to do over again,


2293
01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:34.690
你还会挑选她作为竞选搭档吗
would you have her on the ticket?


2294
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:43.000
世上没有后悔药  安德森
You don't get to go back in time, Anderson,


2295
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:47.670
人生没有重来的机会
and-- and have do-overs in life.


2296
01:54:49.210 --> 01:54:55.410
*天佑美利坚*
? God bless America again ?


2297
01:54:57.180 --> 01:55:03.220
*主啊  当你看见她深陷困苦*
? You see all the trouble that she's in ?

*主啊  请永远庇佑美利坚*

*天佑美利坚*

2302

2303
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:42.150

*天佑美利坚*
? God bless America again ?


2306
01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:58.600
*请拂去她脸上的尘土*

2307
01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:03.040
*拭去她眼中的泪水*

2308
01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:09.310
*主啊  请永远庇佑美利坚*
? God bless America again. ?
