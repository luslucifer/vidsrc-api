00:02:50.292 --> 00:02:51.858
Yeah, it said hollandaise
in the recipe,


40
00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:53.686
but isn't that just French
for "mayonnaise"?


41
00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:54.992

Now, do any of you know why
I chose to write much of my work


95
00:05:26.143 --> 00:05:28.014
in what's called
iambic pentameter?


96
00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:29.364
No.

97
00:05:29.842 --> 00:05:33.237
It's because it mimics
the beating of the human heart.


98
00:05:33.585 --> 00:05:35.892
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum.

99
00:05:36.109 --> 00:05:40.723
What better way
to express love... and loss


100
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.553
and the brevity of human life

101
00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:49.471

- Do I have your word?
-Definitely not.

113
00:06:16.628 --> 00:06:18.761
Still not saying anything.
Please say something.


114
00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:21.764
I've been asked to interview...

115
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.550
for the executive chef position
at the Frontenac.


116
00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:27.639
The Frontenac! 
That's amazing!

117
00:06:27.726 --> 00:06:29.249
That's the new place
in Greenpoint, right?


118
00:06:29.336 --> 00:06:30.816
I don't know what they cook.
I know It's fusion.


119
00:06:30.903 --> 00:06:32.296
- They fuse something.
- No,


120
00:06:32.427 --> 00:06:35.255
it's the Château Frontenac
in... in Quebec City.


121
00:06:35.778 --> 00:06:37.432
- Quebec City, Canada.
- Yeah.


122
00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:39.912
- A little further north.
- They're opening a new restaurant


123
00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:41.174
with this girl
I used to work with.


124
00:06:41.261 --> 00:06:42.828
Ruby Collins. Did I mention her?

125
00:06:42.915 --> 00:06:44.439
- No. Not to me.
- No?


126
00:06:44.613 --> 00:06:48.181
I was her sous-chef,
and now she's this huge deal,


127
00:06:48.268 --> 00:06:50.140
with, like, a Michelin star

128
00:06:50.227 --> 00:06:52.316
and cookbooks
and her own show and--


129
00:06:52.403 --> 00:06:53.926
So, you'd be moving home.

130
00:06:54.187 --> 00:06:57.452
Oh, my God, no.
It's... it's not an offer.


131
00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:00.585
She's just inviting three chefs
to, you know, refine her menu,


132
00:07:00.716 --> 00:07:03.762
and then she'll decide
who gets the job.


133
00:07:04.241 --> 00:07:05.808
And when...
when's all this happening?


134
00:07:05.982 --> 00:07:06.983
I haven't said yes yet.

135
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.028
I, um,
I wanted to talk to you first


136
00:07:09.115 --> 00:07:11.248
because it would get in the way
of our trip upstate.


137
00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:15.165
Well, babe, are you kidding me?
Of course you have to say yes!


138
00:07:15.382 --> 00:07:17.036
This is everything
you've worked for.


139
00:07:17.123 --> 00:07:18.734
I mean, absolutely!

140
00:07:18.821 --> 00:07:20.344
This is-- This sounds like
a very big deal.


141
00:07:21.084 --> 00:07:22.302
What if I get it?

142
00:07:30.876 --> 00:07:33.357
Dad! Dad, please be home.
I'm in a hurry.


143
00:07:33.488 --> 00:07:35.185
<i>I have 17 minutes

148
00:07:43.802 --> 00:07:45.674
Enough with the intercom talk.
I'm in a hurry. Buzz me in!


149
00:07:47.937 --> 00:07:50.374
I was this close, Gord.
Not to riddle you with guilt...


150
00:07:50.548 --> 00:07:52.332
But you will....but I was right there.

151
00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:55.771
I was on the cusp
of figuring out why Mr. Devereux


152
00:07:55.858 --> 00:07:58.425
is suddenly called to the stand
by his paramour.


153
00:07:58.904 --> 00:08:00.819
But enough about my shitty book.

154
00:08:00.906 --> 00:08:03.909

- Isn't it a little early
for Scotch, Dad?


155
00:08:04.127 --> 00:08:05.432
With your gout also.

156
00:08:05.563 --> 00:08:07.522
Not when you've had
writer's block for two months.


157
00:08:07.913 --> 00:08:10.612
Gotta fuel the fire
of creativity. Help yourself.


158
00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:12.265
You know, they... they tend
to frown on day drinking


159
00:08:12.352 --> 00:08:14.354
when you teach middle school.
I want to talk to you...


160
00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:17.662
- about Sophie.
-Aw!


161
00:08:18.445 --> 00:08:21.231
- Well, it was never gonna last.
- No, we're not breaking up.


162
00:08:21.318 --> 00:08:25.104
When it happens, I'll be here,
wasting away on a novel


163
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:27.716
that won't even make it
to an airport kiosk!


164
00:08:27.846 --> 00:08:29.413
Can you listen to me
for one second?


165
00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:33.112
She just got offered this huge
job interview in Quebec City.


166
00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:37.160
And whether she gets it or not,
I realized that she's the one.


167
00:08:37.856 --> 00:08:39.815
I don't wanna be
with anyone else ever again.


168
00:08:39.902 --> 00:08:42.034
And... and I'm gonna
fly up there with her.


169
00:08:42.295 --> 00:08:43.601
- Flying?
- Yeah.


170
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.864
You haven't been on a plane
since you were 13.


171
00:08:46.169 --> 00:08:48.475
You remember
- how that panic attack went?
-I know.


172
00:08:48.563 --> 00:08:49.651
Luckily for the passengers,

173
00:08:49.738 --> 00:08:51.566
my little arms
weren't strong enough


174
00:08:51.653 --> 00:08:52.828
to get the emergency hatch out.

175
00:08:52.915 --> 00:08:54.743
But...
...I'm gonna do it.


176
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.788
And that leaves me
to the real reason I'm here...


177
00:08:58.137 --> 00:08:59.312
Mom's ring.

178
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.013
- My God!
- Yeah.


179
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.189
My son is a genius!

180
00:09:06.319 --> 00:09:09.409
- How so?
- Marrying Sophie
to get Canadian citizenship.


181
00:09:09.496 --> 00:09:11.020
- It's brilliant!
- No, Dad, I--


182
00:09:11.107 --> 00:09:13.675
It's gotta be a formality
to get your old man a passport.


183
00:09:13.849 --> 00:09:16.982
This country has been
in a goddamn free fall


184
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:18.549
since Vietnam!
We gotta get up there


185
00:09:18.897 --> 00:09:21.726
- and beat the rush.
- It's not an immigration ploy.
She's my soulmate!


186
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.120
Say it just like that
to the people at the border.


187
00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.209
- Dad, where is the ring?
- The ring. The...


188
00:09:28.298 --> 00:09:29.429
Yes, of course. The ring.

189
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.345
Mr. Devereux left it
in Daphne's carriage!


190
00:09:32.563 --> 00:09:33.825
That's how she knew!

191
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.567
That's how I end
this godforsaken chapter!


192
00:09:36.654 --> 00:09:37.699
I'm gonna go check your bedroom.

193
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.265
<i>I'm so excited to see you!</i>

194
00:09:39.352 --> 00:09:40.615
I know, Mom.

195
00:09:40.789 --> 00:09:42.834
He's so excited
to meet everyone.


196
00:09:43.008 --> 00:09:44.531
<i>Did you tell him
about Ruby?</i>


197
00:09:45.097 --> 00:09:46.795
Yeah, I told him about Ruby.

198
00:09:46.882 --> 00:09:48.057
<i>How did he take it?</i>

199
00:09:48.274 --> 00:09:50.581
Well, not the whole story,
but...


200
00:09:50.712 --> 00:09:53.453
<i>You have to tell him!</i>

201
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.630
Listen, Mom, I have to go.
Can you just tell Dad--


202
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.718
Listen to me!

203
00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:57.849
<i>No, you listen!</i>

204
00:09:57.936 --> 00:09:59.503
Tell him we're landing at 4:00.

205
00:09:59.634 --> 00:10:02.332
<i>I will,
but promise you'll tell him.</i>


206
00:10:02.637 --> 00:10:05.074
- I love you. Kisses.
-<i>I love you too!</i>


207
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:10.383
Shit.

208
00:10:10.688 --> 00:10:12.864
Check out this bling. What?

209
00:10:12.951 --> 00:10:15.737
I know. It belonged
to my great-grandmother,


210
00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:19.479
Gertrude. She came all the way
from Ireland aboard the Titanic.


211
00:10:19.828 --> 00:10:23.092
Isn't that crazy?
Against all odds, it survived,


212
00:10:23.179 --> 00:10:25.311
even though she was down
in third class,


213
00:10:25.442 --> 00:10:27.618
river dancing with Leo.
Isn't she nice?


214
00:10:27.749 --> 00:10:28.880
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

215
00:10:28.967 --> 00:10:30.229
Okay. Who's got eyes on it?

216
00:10:30.316 --> 00:10:31.709
Don't move an inch.
Nobody move an inch!


217
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.450
That is a precious heirloom.

218
00:10:33.624 --> 00:10:35.452
Look down and see
if you see sparkle.


219
00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.410
- I got it!
- Thank you. Whoo!


220
00:10:37.497 --> 00:10:39.108
You just went from a B to an A,
young lady.


221
00:10:39.238 --> 00:10:41.327
- Why is it rusty?
- It's not rusty. It's an antique.


222
00:10:41.719 --> 00:10:42.981
That's not even a diamond.

223
00:10:43.068 --> 00:10:44.374
It's a diamond, trust me.

224
00:10:44.461 --> 00:10:46.028
It's just cloudy
from the seawater.


225
00:10:46.115 --> 00:10:48.334
Diamonds are a tool
of emotional manipulation


226
00:10:48.421 --> 00:10:50.859
- contrived by baby boomers.
- Okay, Greta Thunberg, thank you.


227
00:10:50.989 --> 00:10:52.730
Show and tell is over.
You guys are a bad buzz.


228
00:10:52.861 --> 00:10:54.601
-Mr. Kinski?
- Yes, Samuel, go for it.


229
00:10:54.906 --> 00:10:56.212
I think he's gonna say yes.

230
00:10:56.342 --> 00:10:59.737
Okay, well, he is a woman.
And I hope that she says yes.


231
00:11:00.129 --> 00:11:02.740
I mean, she doesn't care
about material wealth,


232
00:11:02.827 --> 00:11:04.829
like some people.
She likes simple things.


233
00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:06.526
- Then you're her man!
-Hilarious.


234
00:11:06.918 --> 00:11:09.442
Chase, I told you to try out
for improv. You chose hockey.


235
00:11:09.573 --> 00:11:11.053
All right, let's get into this.

236
00:11:11.183 --> 00:11:13.011
Oh, man! I really am late.

237
00:11:13.098 --> 00:11:14.970
I'm so sorry.
Have a great summer!


238
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.537
And, uh, please read!

239
00:11:17.799 --> 00:11:19.235
The future of humanity
depends on it.


240
00:11:19.365 --> 00:11:20.540
Franklin, up high.

241
00:11:22.673 --> 00:11:24.109
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

242
00:11:24.196 --> 00:11:26.372
<i>if you could please return
to your seats and buckle up,</i>


243
00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:28.070
<i>we're going through
a little turbulence.</i>


244
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.986
<i>We'll resume drink service
momentarily. Thank you.</i>


245
00:11:32.727 --> 00:11:34.076
That's a lot of shaking, huh?

246
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.034
- I think that's too much shaking.
-It's supposed to shake.


247
00:11:36.426 --> 00:11:39.037
It's like a car
on a country road. It's fine.


248
00:11:40.691 --> 00:11:42.301
I don't know if you clocked
the flight attendant.


249
00:11:42.388 --> 00:11:44.782
Not smiling.
And they're trained to smile.


250
00:11:45.261 --> 00:11:46.610
Okay, let me distract myself

251
00:11:46.697 --> 00:11:48.046
by working
on the things I memorized.


252
00:11:48.264 --> 00:11:51.615
Your father's name is Alphonse.
Your mother's name is Ginette.


253
00:11:51.702 --> 00:11:54.444
They met in high school.
Your sister's name is Juliette.


254
00:11:54.531 --> 00:11:55.924
- She just had a baby.
- Yep.


255
00:11:56.011 --> 00:11:58.361
And her baby daddy left her
and went back to Romania,


256
00:11:58.491 --> 00:11:59.971
so your brother, Junior,
hates him.


257
00:12:00.058 --> 00:12:01.103
But he's gonna love me

258
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:02.757
if I bring up
mixed martial arts.


259
00:12:02.844 --> 00:12:04.367
Do you have any idea how hard

260
00:12:04.497 --> 00:12:06.238
this molecular gastronomy stuff
is?


261
00:12:06.369 --> 00:12:08.719
I... I...
- I really have to focus.
- Okay, focus, babe.


262
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.590
- No more from me.
- Thank you.


263
00:12:10.721 --> 00:12:12.070
I'll just study
the safety card.


264
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.464
These people on here
look way too happy.


265
00:12:14.551 --> 00:12:15.900
Who'd be smiling
if this happened?


266
00:12:16.205 --> 00:12:17.772
Why are they so happy
going down the slide?


267
00:12:18.033 --> 00:12:19.382
Did you watch
the safety demonstration?


268
00:12:19.512 --> 00:12:21.906
I don't even know where
my raft is. Where's your raft?


269
00:12:22.124 --> 00:12:24.779
Babe, if we crash,
there's no swimming or rafting.


270
00:12:24.909 --> 00:12:26.911
There's nothing,
except maybe the black box.


271
00:12:27.216 --> 00:12:29.609
- Why would you say that?
- Babe, come on, I gotta focus!


272
00:12:29.696 --> 00:12:33.178
Okay, but wow! Wow, wow!
That's not even funny.


273
00:12:33.265 --> 00:12:35.224
- Is that a pill?
-Yeah,
my father gave it to me.


274
00:12:35.354 --> 00:12:37.182
It's a relaxant.
He knows I'm not a great flyer.


275
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:39.794
- He said it'll take the edge off.
- But you're drinking wine.


276
00:12:40.011 --> 00:12:41.491
Baby I've had only three
and a half glasses.


277
00:12:41.578 --> 00:12:42.753
I'm not flying the damn thing.

278
00:12:42.884 --> 00:12:43.928
Ay, ay, ay.

279
00:12:48.106 --> 00:12:49.194
Wow!

280
00:12:50.239 --> 00:12:52.502
All right. Now, I can relax.

281
00:12:52.632 --> 00:12:55.592
<i>Welcome to Quebec City.</i> GORDON: Thank you!

282
00:12:55.679 --> 00:12:57.420
I dunno, Peter,
what color the pill was.


283
00:12:57.507 --> 00:12:59.074
- Yellow-ish?
- It tasted yellow-ish.


284
00:12:59.204 --> 00:13:00.292
Hang on a second.

285
00:13:01.119 --> 00:13:02.555
Baby, I can't feel my face.

286
00:13:02.686 --> 00:13:04.383
Can you feel your face?
Check your face.


287
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.515
<i>Oh, shit, Sophie!</i>

288
00:13:05.732 --> 00:13:07.517
There's a fifty-fifty
I gave him a Quaalude


289
00:13:07.604 --> 00:13:08.779
instead of a Valium.

290
00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:12.087
- A Quaalude?
-<i>Listen, the '80s
were fucking bananas, man.</i>


291
00:13:12.174 --> 00:13:14.829
Well, the '80s is happening
to your son's brain right now.


292
00:13:14.916 --> 00:13:16.308
<i>Well, tell him
to have a good time.</i>


293
00:13:16.439 --> 00:13:18.006
It should wear off
in a couple hours.


294
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.660
- A couple of hours?
- Do you know how much
I love this woman?


295
00:13:20.747 --> 00:13:22.445
- I gotta go.
- I love you!


296
00:13:22.532 --> 00:13:23.925
Gordon, Gordon. 
You're shouting.

297
00:13:24.055 --> 00:13:25.013
You're shouting.

298
00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.449
Oh. my God.
Get it together, Gordon.


299
00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:28.581
Are you mad at me?
I'm sorry, babe.


300
00:13:28.668 --> 00:13:30.453
My father says
you're gonna break up with me.


301
00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.020
I'm not gonna
break up with you, Gordon.


302
00:13:32.194 --> 00:13:34.936
You should!
- I don't deserve you.
- Gordon, look at me.


303
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.676
My parents... Oh!

304
00:13:36.763 --> 00:13:38.461
...are right outside
those doors, okay?


305
00:13:38.591 --> 00:13:39.810
I'll explain to them
what happened.


306
00:13:39.941 --> 00:13:41.377
You just need to stay
in the chair.


307
00:13:41.551 --> 00:13:42.944
- Stay in the chair.
-Mm. And...


308
00:13:43.118 --> 00:13:44.859
- Not going anywhere.
-Don't say
anything stupid.


309
00:13:44.989 --> 00:13:47.209
I'm not even gonna talk,
except to say that I love them.


310
00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:48.950
I really need you right now
to get it together.


311
00:13:49.037 --> 00:13:50.168
Can you get it together?

312
00:13:50.516 --> 00:13:52.257
I don't know why
she brought him.


313
00:13:52.692 --> 00:13:54.477
You promised you'd be nice.

314
00:13:55.217 --> 00:13:57.654
If she gets the job, I won't
have to be nice for long.


315
00:13:57.828 --> 00:13:59.830
Hey.

316
00:14:03.703 --> 00:14:04.879
He's handicapped.

317
00:14:05.401 --> 00:14:07.055
She never said
he was handicapped.


318
00:14:07.185 --> 00:14:10.536
Yes, but we're gonna
support our daughter.


319
00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:13.583
Whether he's handicapped,
American or anything else.


320
00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:15.454
Hi!

321
00:14:15.585 --> 00:14:17.892
Hey!

322
00:14:20.416 --> 00:14:21.547
I swore
I wouldn't cry.


323
00:14:21.721 --> 00:14:23.419
If you start crying,
I'm definitely gonna cry.


324
00:14:23.506 --> 00:14:25.769
My little girl.
-Daddy.


325
00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:27.902
Um, I should tell you guys...

326
00:14:28.554 --> 00:14:32.123
There was an incident with
some medication Gordon took.


327
00:14:34.299 --> 00:14:35.431
Gordon?

328
00:14:35.779 --> 00:14:37.215
Honey, I found the bag!

329
00:14:37.302 --> 00:14:38.390
No, Gordon, Gordon,
no, no, no!


330
00:14:38.477 --> 00:14:39.652
You don't...
you don't need to do that!


331
00:14:39.739 --> 00:14:41.916
My bag is trying
to go back on the plane!


332
00:14:43.569 --> 00:14:45.136
He seems nice.

333
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.489
Are the drugs a problem?

334
00:14:51.186 --> 00:14:52.622
Dad, I already explained.

335
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.015
Hmm.

336
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.897
Okay, be cool.

337
00:15:08.203 --> 00:15:11.032
Hey, guys, I am so sorry!

338
00:15:11.162 --> 00:15:13.425
I... I hope that she explained
to you everything that happened.


339
00:15:13.512 --> 00:15:16.080
My father roofied me.
But I'm feeling a lot better.


340
00:15:16.167 --> 00:15:17.168
And the good news is

341
00:15:17.255 --> 00:15:18.561
they're not gonna press
any charges


342
00:15:18.648 --> 00:15:20.476
about riding
their baggage claim.


343
00:15:20.563 --> 00:15:21.738
Let's start over.

344
00:15:21.825 --> 00:15:25.046
Ginette, Alphonse,
it's so nice to meet you.


345
00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:26.308
Okay, let's go.

346
00:15:26.395 --> 00:15:28.179
Parking is gonna
cost me a fortune.


347
00:15:28.266 --> 00:15:29.833
Let me help you
with the bag.


348
00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.008
Okay, I'll help her.

349
00:15:31.095 --> 00:15:32.140
Let me help you,
please, Ginette.


350
00:15:32.705 --> 00:15:34.403
That's nice of you.
-[IN ENGLISH] Thank you.


351
00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:37.058
- Okay. Let's start over. Okay?
-[IN FRENCH] Yes!


352
00:15:37.145 --> 00:15:38.885
We're all friends.
- Okay.


353
00:15:55.076 --> 00:15:57.817
<i>Look at this place.
Unbelievable.</i>


354
00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:00.820
<i>Four hundred years of history!</i>

355
00:16:01.386 --> 00:16:03.823
Are those the infamous
Plains of Abraham


356
00:16:04.172 --> 00:16:05.956
where General Montcalm
and General Wolfe


357
00:16:06.043 --> 00:16:07.088
fought to the death?

358
00:16:07.175 --> 00:16:09.003
Mm! Someone did their homework.

359
00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:11.135
Down with the Brits, I say!
That's something we Americans


360
00:16:11.222 --> 00:16:12.658
and you French
have in common.


361
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:15.313
There it is, baby.
The Frontenac.


362
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.751
Oh! You didn't tell me
it was an actual castle.


363
00:16:19.013 --> 00:16:20.884
- That's where you're gonna work?
- I mean, we'll see.


364
00:16:21.058 --> 00:16:22.233
It's a done deal.

365
00:16:34.463 --> 00:16:36.117
Sophie said
you hand-built the house


366
00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:37.857
with your father
when you were a kid?


367
00:16:38.119 --> 00:16:39.294
Two years of blood and sweat.

368
00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:43.254
Wow! The pictures
don't do it justice!


369
00:16:43.341 --> 00:16:46.605
Look at that flagstone,
the masonry! That's a lost art.


370
00:16:46.692 --> 00:16:47.737
TREMBLAY FARM

371
00:16:47.824 --> 00:16:49.608
You know,
I'm a bit of a builder myself.


372
00:16:49.826 --> 00:16:51.741
Not houses like
this masterpiece,


373
00:16:51.915 --> 00:16:54.396
but are you familiar with
the Lego architectural series?


374
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.050
Yeah, they say 13 and up,

375
00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.182
but if you're not in your 20s,
forget about it!


376
00:16:58.269 --> 00:16:59.792
Yeah,
you have to be very meticulous.


377
00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:01.881
Yeah. Yeah.
I just finished the Taj Mahal.


378
00:17:01.968 --> 00:17:03.100
And this one
was particularly hard,


379
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:04.667
right, babe?
'Cause I bought it on eBay,


380
00:17:04.797 --> 00:17:06.103
and the instructions
were in Korean.


381
00:17:06.234 --> 00:17:07.365
[IN FRENCH] Oh my God... Oh.

382
00:17:07.452 --> 00:17:08.758
Everyone's here!

383
00:17:08.888 --> 00:17:10.934
Why didn't you tell me? Hi!

384
00:17:11.978 --> 00:17:13.850
Your hair is so long!

385
00:17:13.937 --> 00:17:15.417
Yeah,
that's what he wants to hear,


386
00:17:15.504 --> 00:17:18.681
that you play with toys.
You fucking idiot. Hey!


387
00:17:18.811 --> 00:17:20.987
Guys,
I can't believe you're here!


388
00:17:21.075 --> 00:17:22.380
You didn't
forget about us?


389
00:17:22.511 --> 00:17:24.730
Never in a million years.

390
00:17:24.948 --> 00:17:27.081
- Meet your nephew, Laurent.
- Laurent!


391
00:17:28.125 --> 00:17:30.780
Mammie...

392
00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.608
As beautiful as ever!

393
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.219
There's my sister!

394
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.699
[IN ENGLISH] Hello!

395
00:17:36.786 --> 00:17:38.092
Check out these arms! Wow!

396
00:17:39.397 --> 00:17:41.443
Gordon, come,
come meet my family.


397
00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:42.574
Hi!

398
00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.011
Everyone, I want you
to meet my boyfriend, Gordon.


399
00:17:45.186 --> 00:17:47.536
It's his first time in Quebec,
so please be nice.


400
00:17:47.666 --> 00:17:49.146
- Especially you.
- What?


401
00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.061
Look at him.
Nervous as a squirrel.


402
00:17:51.192 --> 00:17:53.542
Hey...
Does he understand anything?


403
00:17:53.672 --> 00:17:55.239
I don't know.
Does he speak French?


404
00:17:55.326 --> 00:17:56.719
No, no, no,
I... I understand French,


405
00:17:56.849 --> 00:17:59.025
actually pretty well,
thanks to her tutelage.


406
00:17:59.156 --> 00:18:01.419
But my speaking
is a little <i>comme ci, comme ça.</i>


407
00:18:01.506 --> 00:18:03.160
Oh, no, your French
is great, honey. For real.


408
00:18:03.247 --> 00:18:04.988
Ah!  We'll see.

409
00:18:05.119 --> 00:18:08.078
Um. Okay, so,
- this is my cousin Patrice.
- Hi!


410
00:18:08.165 --> 00:18:10.298
My aunt, Claudette,
my uncle, Michel... GORDON: So nice to meet you.


411
00:18:10.428 --> 00:18:13.562
...my sister, Juliette,
and her baby, Laurent...


412
00:18:13.736 --> 00:18:16.391
- Laurent!
-...and my brother,
Junior.


413
00:18:16.739 --> 00:18:18.871
And last but not least,
Mammie Tremblay.


414
00:18:18.958 --> 00:18:21.004
Well, of course
I've heard about Mammie!


415
00:18:21.135 --> 00:18:23.093
Gotta kiss the cheek
of the matriarch!


416
00:18:25.008 --> 00:18:26.357
Wow,
this guy doesn't waste any time.


417
00:18:26.662 --> 00:18:28.751
No, no, no,
- I'm so sorry.
-Oh, my God!


418
00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:31.623
Roger, we can't.
My parents are inside.


419
00:18:31.754 --> 00:18:34.409
Mammie, it's not Roger,
it's Gordon.


420
00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:35.888
Sophie's boyfriend.

421
00:18:35.975 --> 00:18:38.064
Come inside, Mom.
I'll make you some tea.


422
00:18:38.195 --> 00:18:39.631
-Oh!
-
I'm so sorry.


423
00:18:39.718 --> 00:18:42.547
- She has dementia.
- Oh, okay. Okay, yeah.


424
00:18:42.678 --> 00:18:45.507
My... my uncle Lester
has dementia, so I understand.


425
00:18:45.594 --> 00:18:48.727
I've been there. Is it harder
on them or on us? I mean...


426
00:18:48.814 --> 00:18:50.642
Junior! Want a beer?

427
00:18:50.729 --> 00:18:51.904
Come on, Dad.

428
00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.997
Of course,
I never kissed my uncle Lester,


429
00:18:58.084 --> 00:19:00.043
but...

430
00:19:00.174 --> 00:19:01.305
I'll get the bags!

431
00:19:04.656 --> 00:19:08.399
Aw! Hey, little buddy!
My majestic, feathered friend.


432
00:19:08.704 --> 00:19:11.054
What's your name? Oh!

433
00:19:11.185 --> 00:19:13.578
Shit! How are you this fast?

434
00:19:23.545 --> 00:19:25.590
Oh no,
- I left Gordon with all the bags.
- Oh!


435
00:19:25.677 --> 00:19:27.679
Oh, babe,
I'm so sorry. You okay?


436
00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:28.985
Yeah, I got it all,
I got it all.


437
00:19:29.072 --> 00:19:31.074
I just got attacked
by a white pterodactyl.


438
00:19:31.205 --> 00:19:33.990
Oh, yeah, that's Coucou.
She's, uh, our swan.


439
00:19:34.077 --> 00:19:36.993
She's lived on the farm forever.
She can be a bit cranky.


440
00:19:37.123 --> 00:19:39.169
I don't think she's a fan yet,
but I'm gonna win her over.


441
00:19:39.256 --> 00:19:41.476
This place
- is so cute.
- Thank you.


442
00:19:41.606 --> 00:19:42.955
Where are we staying?
Where should I put--


443
00:19:43.042 --> 00:19:44.218
Um, so, my sister and her baby

444
00:19:44.305 --> 00:19:46.045
are going to be sleeping
in our old room,


445
00:19:46.132 --> 00:19:47.612
so we'll be taking my brother's,

446
00:19:47.743 --> 00:19:51.007
which is, um, straight up
the stairs, second on the left.


447
00:19:51.094 --> 00:19:53.052
- You want some help?
- No, I got it.
Go talk to your family.


448
00:19:53.139 --> 00:19:54.924
- I'm fine!
-You sure?
All right. You okay?


449
00:19:55.011 --> 00:19:56.621
Yeah, I got it. I got it.
Go talk to your family.


450
00:20:01.974 --> 00:20:03.019
Hello!

451
00:20:16.989 --> 00:20:19.165
Samurai Kinski,
here for the briss.


452
00:20:19.253 --> 00:20:20.384
Pretty cool, huh?

453
00:20:20.689 --> 00:20:23.169
Oh! I'm so sorry,
man. I've just never seen


454
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.997
one of these in real life.
It's so cool.


455
00:20:28.044 --> 00:20:30.612
I got it on eBay.

456
00:20:30.742 --> 00:20:33.528
It belonged to a Samurai
who killed 200 people.


457
00:20:34.877 --> 00:20:36.052
It's awesome.

458
00:20:40.361 --> 00:20:42.624
It says, "Made in China."
Aren't samurai Japanese?


459
00:20:42.711 --> 00:20:45.017
Yeah, I know.
I got screwed.


460
00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:46.715
700 bucks.

461
00:20:46.802 --> 00:20:48.543
But it's still...
it's still beautiful


462
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:50.588
and... and... and very sharp.

463
00:20:50.806 --> 00:20:52.329
So, you didn't get gypped there.

464
00:20:52.416 --> 00:20:53.635
Listen...

465
00:20:55.027 --> 00:20:57.552
Sophie says, uh,
that you are an English coach?


466
00:20:57.726 --> 00:21:00.250
Well, I teach, uh,
eighth grade English, yeah.


467
00:21:02.383 --> 00:21:03.906
I failed
my English exam.


468
00:21:04.036 --> 00:21:06.082
If I don't pass next time,
I can't become a cop.


469
00:21:06.169 --> 00:21:07.736
You're asking
for help? I'll totally help.


470
00:21:07.823 --> 00:21:09.128
Really?
Of course!


471
00:21:09.215 --> 00:21:10.913
It's been my dream
since I was a kid.


472
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.697
Well, let's make
that dream come true, bud!


473
00:21:15.396 --> 00:21:17.267
Yes!

474
00:21:21.358 --> 00:21:23.708
If you hurt Sophie,
I'll cut your head off.


475
00:21:24.579 --> 00:21:25.623
I won't.

476
00:21:26.711 --> 00:21:27.669
It's a joke!

477
00:21:27.973 --> 00:21:29.845
You're good.

478
00:21:29.932 --> 00:21:31.237
Make yourself at home.

479
00:21:31.368 --> 00:21:33.544
Okay, thank you.
-Hey!


480
00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:36.895
Don't fuck my sister in my bed.

481
00:21:47.689 --> 00:21:48.864
Of course.

482
00:22:02.486 --> 00:22:04.270
Hey, <i>toi! Bon...</i>

483
00:22:04.401 --> 00:22:06.098
Should we taste? <i>Oui.</i>

484
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:08.753
Mm. Hmm...

485
00:22:09.406 --> 00:22:11.408
No, that's way too much
tomato paste.


486
00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:14.455
Ms. Expert...
Don't forget who taught you.


487
00:22:14.542 --> 00:22:16.631
Same person as you. Mammie?

488
00:22:16.848 --> 00:22:18.110
A quarter cup per pound of beef.

489
00:22:18.197 --> 00:22:19.242
Voilà!

490
00:22:19.851 --> 00:22:21.549
Mammie,
you're knitting your scarf
into your shawl again.


491
00:22:21.679 --> 00:22:23.768
Alphonse!
Can you come help your mother?


492
00:22:23.899 --> 00:22:24.856
Coming!

493
00:22:27.642 --> 00:22:28.556
So?

494
00:22:29.992 --> 00:22:31.776
How did he react
when you told him?


495
00:22:31.907 --> 00:22:33.169
Told him what?

496
00:22:33.299 --> 00:22:36.694
Come on. About you and Ruby.

497
00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:39.175
I didn't tell him yet.

498
00:22:39.262 --> 00:22:41.395
Sophie Jeanne Tremblay!

499
00:22:41.482 --> 00:22:43.135
Oh! Your full name.

500
00:22:43.266 --> 00:22:45.877
I'm just waiting
for the right moment.


501
00:22:46.008 --> 00:22:47.444
Ah yes, the right moment.

502
00:22:47.575 --> 00:22:49.315
So, after you fall
back in love with her.


503
00:22:49.446 --> 00:22:51.056
Not tonight, Juliette.

504
00:22:51.187 --> 00:22:52.884
Relax.
I'm just messing with you.


505
00:22:53.015 --> 00:22:54.799
For now,
nobody says anything, okay?


506
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:56.279
That's a hell of a plan.

507
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.977
If I get the job,
then I'll tell him.


508
00:22:59.935 --> 00:23:01.632
I don't want
to worry him for nothing.


509
00:23:01.763 --> 00:23:02.981
You don't know Gordon.

510
00:23:03.112 --> 00:23:04.418
He can get a little anxious.

511
00:23:04.635 --> 00:23:06.289
- You don't say.
-What?


512
00:23:06.637 --> 00:23:08.073
- He can get a little anxious!
- Oh.


513
00:23:09.379 --> 00:23:11.816
That looks good.

514
00:23:11.903 --> 00:23:13.078
Juliette...

515
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.692
My girl,
you're playing with fire.


516
00:23:32.489 --> 00:23:34.883
I'm gonna get you
to like organic wine.


517
00:23:35.187 --> 00:23:36.972
You're not listening.
You're crazy.


518
00:23:37.102 --> 00:23:40.192
If you suck on the first line,
you suck on the second!


519
00:23:40.323 --> 00:23:41.716
You didn't even watch the game!

520
00:23:41.846 --> 00:23:43.761
I'm not gonna ruin my property
with a pool.


521
00:23:43.892 --> 00:23:46.068
When the kids were small,
they swam in the pond.


522
00:23:46.198 --> 00:23:47.983
I just feel like a milk farm.

523
00:23:48.113 --> 00:23:49.767
My tits are so sore.

524
00:23:49.854 --> 00:23:51.726
You don't know
what you're talking about!


525
00:23:51.813 --> 00:23:52.857
He's only 22.

526
00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:54.946
George![IN ENGLISH] Uh. It's Gordon.

527
00:23:55.077 --> 00:23:56.861
Jordan... Sure.

528
00:23:57.035 --> 00:23:58.689
You're from New York?
You're a Rangers fan?


529
00:23:58.776 --> 00:23:59.908
What do you think of Lafrenière?

530
00:23:59.995 --> 00:24:02.040
Oh, I actually
don't follow hockey.


531
00:24:04.478 --> 00:24:08.090
But I... I love figure skating.

532
00:24:08.394 --> 00:24:09.613
Figure skating?

533
00:24:11.354 --> 00:24:12.921
Yeah, uh, sure.

534
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:18.317
You know, Boitano, Yamaguchi,
Hamilton, and of course,


535
00:24:18.448 --> 00:24:20.189
I'm not forgetting
all the Canadian greats, uh,


536
00:24:20.842 --> 00:24:22.452
Stojko, Browning,

537
00:24:22.844 --> 00:24:25.760
Salé and Pelletier
with that incredible performance


538
00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.023
in Salt Lake City.
Mammie, you remember that?


539
00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.329
I mean, to land a quad,

540
00:24:30.678 --> 00:24:33.071
and then to go
right into a triple Axel?


541
00:24:33.202 --> 00:24:34.420
Insanity. Who does that?

542
00:24:34.725 --> 00:24:37.554
I'll tell you who. They did.

543
00:24:38.947 --> 00:24:40.601
Also, the costumes...

544
00:24:42.298 --> 00:24:43.517
dazzling.

545
00:24:46.563 --> 00:24:49.871
- A fellow guest. Let me.
- No, stay. I'll... I'll get it.


546
00:24:49.958 --> 00:24:51.437
This is too... You're...

547
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.092
Voilà!

548
00:24:56.573 --> 00:24:57.835
Actually, when I was a kid,
I, uh...


549
00:24:57.966 --> 00:24:59.794
Merry Christmas.
- You too, Mammie.


550
00:25:02.753 --> 00:25:04.102
It's a speed thing.

551
00:25:04.668 --> 00:25:06.975
He spent
the whole summer power skating!


552
00:25:12.546 --> 00:25:13.590
Ruby!

553
00:25:14.983 --> 00:25:17.594
Hi!
You're here! Wh...


554
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.596
Well,
you couldn't join us for drinks,


555
00:25:19.727 --> 00:25:22.294
so, I brought the drinks to you.

556
00:25:23.165 --> 00:25:25.080
Hey, tout le monde,
you remember Ruby?


557
00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.821
Oh, <i>ben, tabarnak!</i>

558
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:29.171
Hello, my friends!

559
00:25:29.258 --> 00:25:30.825
It's been too long!

560
00:25:30.955 --> 00:25:33.044
Nobody's changed a bit.

561
00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.524
Alphie...

562
00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.831
It's good to see you.

563
00:25:36.918 --> 00:25:39.398
I brought you
your favorite, an '86 Pomerol.


564
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:40.922
- Oh!
- Birth year of this bombshell.


565
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.054
But they only had a magnum,

566
00:25:43.185 --> 00:25:44.578
so I hope you're thirsty.

567
00:25:44.752 --> 00:25:46.275
It's too much. <i>Merci beaucoup!</i>

568
00:25:46.492 --> 00:25:48.843
Junior, if I could-
-[IN FRENCH] Stop fidgeting.

569
00:25:49.017 --> 00:25:50.018
Let's get the decanter!

570
00:25:50.279 --> 00:25:51.846
So, you're
the famous Ruby Collins.


571
00:25:51.976 --> 00:25:54.326
And you must be
the one-and-only Gordon.


572
00:25:54.457 --> 00:25:56.067
I never got your family name.

573
00:25:56.198 --> 00:25:58.330
Uh. It's Kinski.
But don't worry about that.


574
00:25:58.461 --> 00:25:59.897
I gotta say,
when Sophie told me about you,


575
00:26:00.028 --> 00:26:03.118
I... I pictured someone
a little more like Julia Childs.


576
00:26:03.248 --> 00:26:04.598
Not someone so...

577
00:26:06.774 --> 00:26:08.776
- Dazzling?
- Dazzling is right!


578
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:10.691
- Let's find a chair for Ruby.
-Yes.


579
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:12.736
And you will not believe

580
00:26:12.867 --> 00:26:15.913
what happens that day.
The compressor breaks


581
00:26:16.087 --> 00:26:17.915
that morning! That's a nightmare!

582
00:26:18.002 --> 00:26:20.701
And the Secret Service
gets there. Oh, I remember.


583
00:26:20.788 --> 00:26:22.703
And we have nothing
to feed the Obamas.


584
00:26:23.312 --> 00:26:24.661
And then Sophie here confessed

585
00:26:24.748 --> 00:26:27.795
that she had a pound and a half
of Japanese bluefin


586
00:26:27.882 --> 00:26:29.710
that she was going
to surprise me with


587
00:26:29.797 --> 00:26:30.798
for my birthday dinner.

588
00:26:30.928 --> 00:26:32.364
Oh, you're so sweet, baby.

589
00:26:32.451 --> 00:26:34.671
She runs back to her place,
grabs the fish.


590
00:26:34.802 --> 00:26:37.456
We cook them this,
oh, incredible meal.


591
00:26:37.587 --> 00:26:39.154
It was insanely good!

592
00:26:39.284 --> 00:26:41.678
And now I have
Michelle's number in my phone.


593
00:26:41.983 --> 00:26:43.114
Are you kidding me?

594
00:26:43.288 --> 00:26:44.986
Like, you could text
Michelle Obama right now?


595
00:26:45.073 --> 00:26:46.944
Mm. And Sasha and Malia.

596
00:26:47.031 --> 00:26:48.990
We should send them,
like, a funny GIF or something.


597
00:26:49.425 --> 00:26:51.993
Babe, you never told me
you cooked for POTUS and FLOTUS.


598
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.298
He wasn't even
in office anymore.


599
00:26:53.516 --> 00:26:54.996
Oh, it's not a big deal.
He wasn't in office.


600
00:26:55.126 --> 00:26:57.476
He's just hanging out
with Michelle and, like, Jay-Z.


601
00:26:57.563 --> 00:27:00.654
You gotta be kidding me.
That is so cool.


602
00:27:00.784 --> 00:27:02.568
Hey, by the way,
cooking for heads of state


603
00:27:02.656 --> 00:27:04.875
should definitely factor into
the decision-making process.


604
00:27:04.962 --> 00:27:07.486
- Am I right, parents? Right?
-That's right.


605
00:27:07.573 --> 00:27:09.314
- It will.
-Good, good.


606
00:27:09.619 --> 00:27:11.490
And what about you,
- Gordon?
- Mm!


607
00:27:11.577 --> 00:27:12.796
I mean,
what are you gonna do


608
00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:15.451
while I keep your girlfriend
locked away in the castle?


609
00:27:15.625 --> 00:27:17.932
Oh, don't worry about me.

610
00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:20.325
I will be fully booked
making sure Junior here


611
00:27:20.412 --> 00:27:21.979
doesn't fail
his English exam again.


612
00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:23.024
Right, buddy?

613
00:27:27.637 --> 00:27:29.508
You're taking the exam again?

614
00:27:29.987 --> 00:27:31.119
Yup.

615
00:27:32.642 --> 00:27:34.600
We agreed you were done
with that.


616
00:27:34.688 --> 00:27:35.819
You belong on the farm!

617
00:27:35.906 --> 00:27:36.994
Here we go.

618
00:27:37.299 --> 00:27:39.170
When are you gonna realize
the farm is your dream,


619
00:27:39.257 --> 00:27:40.258
not mine?

620
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:42.391
I don't have time to dream.

621
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.567
I'm too busy putting food
on the table.


622
00:27:44.698 --> 00:27:46.221
You think
that just happens all by itself?


623
00:27:46.308 --> 00:27:47.570
Alphonse, not now.

624
00:27:47.657 --> 00:27:49.311
Why can Sophie follow
her dreams, but not me?


625
00:27:49.398 --> 00:27:51.008
Sophie's not an imbecile

626
00:27:51.095 --> 00:27:52.793
who lives
in her parents' shed at 26!


627
00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.229
I hate you!

628
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.014
It's not fair!

629
00:27:57.536 --> 00:27:58.886
A cop who cries.

630
00:28:00.061 --> 00:28:02.150
You've gotta talk to your son.

631
00:28:02.237 --> 00:28:05.501
Oh, I'll talk to him.
I'll talk to him.


632
00:28:08.983 --> 00:28:10.506
This is delicious,
by the way.


633
00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:14.336
Well, this is going really well.

634
00:28:14.728 --> 00:28:18.644
- Hey! I think you're doing great.
- I've been here six hours.


635
00:28:18.732 --> 00:28:20.081
I've been interrogated
by the feds.


636
00:28:20.255 --> 00:28:21.647
I made out with your grandma.

637
00:28:21.735 --> 00:28:23.214
I betrayed your brother.
It's not going great.


638
00:28:23.345 --> 00:28:25.826
Yeah, but he should have
told you not to say anything.


639
00:28:26.174 --> 00:28:28.132
You know what?
They fight all the time.


640
00:28:28.219 --> 00:28:29.699
So, don't worry you about it, okay?

641
00:28:31.614 --> 00:28:33.790
On the other hand,
that Ruby is amazing, huh?


642
00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:36.010
Yeah, yeah,
she's... she's something.


643
00:28:36.097 --> 00:28:39.448
I mean, cooking steaks
in a volcano with Bear Grylls?


644
00:28:39.622 --> 00:28:41.189
He's a lucky guy.

645
00:28:41.406 --> 00:28:43.191
Is someone crushing a little?

646
00:28:43.278 --> 00:28:46.585
Uh, I don't think I have a shot,
babe. That whole story she told


647
00:28:46.672 --> 00:28:49.066
about Victoria Secret models
in Ibiza...


648
00:28:49.197 --> 00:28:50.633
Yeah, wow.

649
00:28:50.981 --> 00:28:52.548
But, hey, you could
use it to your advantage.


650
00:28:53.201 --> 00:28:55.203
A little flirting
could go a long way.


651
00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:58.075
That's smart.
Speaking about flirting...


652
00:28:58.293 --> 00:29:02.514
- Go on.
- I would also like
to go a long way.


653
00:29:02.601 --> 00:29:05.300
Mm...

654
00:29:14.352 --> 00:29:15.832
What's happening?

655
00:29:17.616 --> 00:29:19.444
She can't really see
or hear very well,


656
00:29:19.531 --> 00:29:22.883
so if we don't move,
she won't even know we're here.


657
00:29:23.492 --> 00:29:25.407
- Like a T-Rex.
- Yeah.


658
00:29:26.408 --> 00:29:29.193
There you are.

659
00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.849
Grammy Mammie,
more than meets the eye.


660
00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.378
<i>You're not gonna
say anything about Gordon?</i>


661
00:29:40.901 --> 00:29:43.729
Well, he seems to
really love figure skating.


662
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.385
Before you judge him,
it was his mom's favorite sport.


663
00:29:47.472 --> 00:29:49.431
He watches it with his dad
to remember her.


664
00:29:49.561 --> 00:29:50.998
I'm not judging him.

665
00:29:51.999 --> 00:29:54.131
Just promise
you'll give him a chance.


666
00:29:54.262 --> 00:29:56.090
- I promise.
- Thank you.


667
00:30:00.485 --> 00:30:02.052
The Veilleux family
sold the farm?


668
00:30:02.226 --> 00:30:06.056
National Agro knows we
can't compete with their prices.


669
00:30:06.143 --> 00:30:07.666
They're squeezing us out.

670
00:30:08.798 --> 00:30:11.409
If things don't change
next year...


671
00:30:13.629 --> 00:30:15.326
...I'll have to sell
the farm too.


672
00:30:16.501 --> 00:30:17.894
You're not serious.

673
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:20.679
That's why I was hard
on your brother.


674
00:30:22.072 --> 00:30:23.421
I need his help on the farm.

675
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:34.041
I don't want you to worry.

676
00:30:34.215 --> 00:30:36.304
- Okay.
- It's my problem.


677
00:30:36.608 --> 00:30:38.567
- All right.
- You have a job to win.


678
00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.482
And we want you back home.

679
00:30:43.267 --> 00:30:44.790
Okay, I should go.

680
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:47.489
- I'm gonna do well, right?
- Of course you'll do well.


681
00:30:48.969 --> 00:30:50.144
All right.

682
00:31:58.995 --> 00:32:00.910
Aw! So cute!

683
00:32:11.573 --> 00:32:13.053
Oh, baby!

684
00:32:16.273 --> 00:32:18.101
Def Leppard, yes!

685
00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:22.584
Hug fest!

686
00:32:25.413 --> 00:32:26.762
Whose dog is that?

687
00:32:38.078 --> 00:32:39.166
What the fuck?

688
00:32:43.083 --> 00:32:44.388
Ms. Tremblay,
I presume?


689
00:32:44.562 --> 00:32:45.737
Yes, that's me.

690
00:32:45.824 --> 00:32:48.479
I'm sorry.
They told me to wait here.


691
00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:49.567
Malcolm Gervais Dorian.

692
00:32:50.046 --> 00:32:52.353
Manager and minority owner
of Ruby.


693
00:32:52.614 --> 00:32:54.311
A pleasure to meet you, Malcolm.

694
00:32:54.442 --> 00:32:56.835
Malcolm. Olm.

695
00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.185
Oh.

696
00:33:04.843 --> 00:33:06.976
Wow. It's incredible.

697
00:33:07.063 --> 00:33:08.412
It better be
for 3 million dollars.


698
00:33:08.499 --> 00:33:10.719
Or more if everyone
keeps working so slowly.


699
00:33:10.849 --> 00:33:13.243
You hear me, Jean-Jacques?
I'm talking to you!


700
00:33:15.071 --> 00:33:16.420
And now we're late.

701
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.511
Okay, we can start now.

702
00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:28.041
Let's go!

703
00:33:29.738 --> 00:33:31.566
Chef will be with you
momentarily.


704
00:33:33.133 --> 00:33:35.309
Come on!
That doesn't go there!


705
00:33:36.049 --> 00:33:37.746
Hi! I'm Sophie.

706
00:33:37.963 --> 00:33:40.966
Frederick. La Shangra, Chicago.

707
00:33:41.054 --> 00:33:43.708
Antoine. Tic Tac Toe, Byron Bay.

708
00:33:43.795 --> 00:33:44.883
Hey, I know your place!

709
00:33:45.362 --> 00:33:47.538
- Of course you do.
-Good morning,


710
00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:50.193
my impressionable
little cherubs.


711
00:33:50.454 --> 00:33:54.589
Ruby will be the crown jewel
of my culinary empire.


712
00:33:55.503 --> 00:33:59.115
When our guests walk through
those very expensive doors,


713
00:33:59.376 --> 00:34:02.292
they will be thrust
into a gastronomical portal


714
00:34:02.379 --> 00:34:04.686
that will make them
shit their pants.


715
00:34:20.049 --> 00:34:21.616
Time.

716
00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:26.490
Terrible.

717
00:34:27.491 --> 00:34:30.146
You managed to remove
every single atom of flavor.


718
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.278
Nice.

719
00:34:35.195 --> 00:34:36.892
Last and definitely least,

720
00:34:37.066 --> 00:34:40.504
Sophie, I prefer no taste
than this culinary genocide.


721
00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:42.158
I couldn't get the foam to rise.

722
00:34:42.289 --> 00:34:44.160
I don't want
your excuses, Sophie.


723
00:34:44.291 --> 00:34:46.423
I want you to execute.

724
00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:48.469
Because that's the title, right?

725
00:34:48.904 --> 00:34:52.473
Executive chef.
A chef who can execute.


726
00:34:52.734 --> 00:34:54.170
If you're all
gonna be this shit,


727
00:34:54.257 --> 00:34:56.564
tell me now
so I can find real chefs,


728
00:34:57.042 --> 00:34:59.828
not line cooks who couldn't
cut it in a hospital cafeteria.


729
00:35:00.611 --> 00:35:02.178
- Start again.
-Yes, chef!


730
00:35:02.874 --> 00:35:04.789
<i>Yeah, she told me
she'd been with women before,</i>


731
00:35:04.876 --> 00:35:05.921
<i>but this is her ex.</i>

732
00:35:06.139 --> 00:35:08.445
I always sensed
a sapphic energy from her.


733
00:35:08.532 --> 00:35:11.318
Let's not label it, Dad, okay?
She's... she's French.


734
00:35:11.405 --> 00:35:13.494
They explore their bodies
differently over here.


735
00:35:13.624 --> 00:35:16.192
Doesn't change the fact
that she lied to you.


736
00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:18.238
She didn't lie.

737
00:35:18.325 --> 00:35:20.022
She just left out
some of the specifics


738
00:35:20.153 --> 00:35:21.937
because she loves me
and she was protecting


739
00:35:22.024 --> 00:35:24.722
- my feelings.
- How did I raise you
to be so naiïve?


740
00:35:24.809 --> 00:35:28.161
Word of advice, pop the question
before she switches teams again!


741
00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:30.554
There will be no switching
of teams, Dad, okay?


742
00:35:30.641 --> 00:35:33.253
She's here in a...
in a professional capacity.


743
00:35:33.383 --> 00:35:35.516
So was Billie Jean King
with her secretary.


744
00:35:35.603 --> 00:35:37.082
I have no idea
what that means,


745
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.388
but I'm pretty sure
it's not helpful.


746
00:35:38.519 --> 00:35:40.521
<i>I'm just saying,
don't waste any time.</i>


747
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:41.783
<i>By the way,</i>

748
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:44.264
French Canadians
were notoriously Catholics.


749
00:35:44.873 --> 00:35:46.701
So you might want
to ask her father first.


750
00:35:46.788 --> 00:35:48.529
Oh, I don't think
he likes me very much.


751
00:35:48.659 --> 00:35:50.661
Then do what you mother
and I did and get her pregnant.


752
00:35:50.792 --> 00:35:51.967
Then he'll force you
to marry her!


753
00:35:52.141 --> 00:35:54.274
This is the worst pep talk
you've ever tried to--


754
00:35:55.971 --> 00:35:57.277
Dad, I gotta go.

755
00:35:57.581 --> 00:35:59.888
- Morning!
-Already up?


756
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.586
You sure you don't want
to sleep an extra 15 minutes?


757
00:36:02.717 --> 00:36:04.022
It's only 9:45.

758
00:36:04.197 --> 00:36:06.111
Oh, I'm just taking in
your incredible property.


759
00:36:06.286 --> 00:36:09.202
It's so beautiful.
Everything is just blossoming.


760
00:36:09.289 --> 00:36:12.596
Your tomatoes are coming in.
Wow! That's a lot of blood.


761
00:36:13.031 --> 00:36:14.163
Come here.

762
00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.992
In there?

763
00:36:31.833 --> 00:36:32.877
Hey...

764
00:36:34.314 --> 00:36:35.489
this is, uh...

765
00:36:36.446 --> 00:36:38.492
This is nice!
What a setup you have here.


766
00:36:38.883 --> 00:36:42.974
Go get me the lamb
in the third stall on the right.


767
00:36:44.106 --> 00:36:45.673
A lamb?
Why am I getting a lamb?


768
00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:46.761
It's our dinner.

769
00:36:48.371 --> 00:36:49.677
Mm!

770
00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:53.637
That's gonna be great!

771
00:36:54.682 --> 00:36:57.989
You know what else is great?
Is, uh, ratatouille,


772
00:36:58.251 --> 00:37:00.644
or a... or a hearty salad.
I love that.


773
00:37:00.731 --> 00:37:03.256
You... you throw
some walnuts and some beets,


774
00:37:03.386 --> 00:37:05.301
some... some feta cheese.
Everybody loves it.


775
00:37:05.432 --> 00:37:06.781
Everyone will be like,
"Alphonse,


776
00:37:06.868 --> 00:37:08.826
how could-
- This is--"We're having lamb.

777
00:37:09.653 --> 00:37:11.699
Okay. Uh...

778
00:37:12.134 --> 00:37:15.355
Well, I'll go...
check on the little fella,


779
00:37:15.746 --> 00:37:17.966
and see if he's ready...

780
00:37:18.619 --> 00:37:19.620
Mm-hmm.

781
00:37:20.708 --> 00:37:22.144
...to be done with life.

782
00:37:24.015 --> 00:37:26.322
Hey! Hey!

783
00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.585
Hey, buddy! Hey!

784
00:37:29.369 --> 00:37:30.413
Hi!

785
00:37:31.371 --> 00:37:32.676
Oh, you're so cute.

786
00:37:33.895 --> 00:37:35.462
I have a sweater just like you.

787
00:37:36.941 --> 00:37:38.160
Hey, come over here.

788
00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:39.683
We need to have
a heart-to-heart.


789
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:43.513
You and I are gonna have to
go on a little walk together.


790
00:37:43.731 --> 00:37:45.733
Look, here's the problem,
I'm in love, okay?


791
00:37:45.863 --> 00:37:47.909
I have to get this guy to like--

792
00:37:47.996 --> 00:37:49.693
I know you understand, okay?

793
00:37:50.738 --> 00:37:52.305
Maybe we can hang out in heaven.

794
00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:55.612
Alphonse, I think she knows!

795
00:37:57.962 --> 00:38:00.574
There you go.

796
00:38:01.662 --> 00:38:03.620
I hope this is my piece.

797
00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.542
You're not a very
physical guy, are you?


798
00:38:12.673 --> 00:38:14.196
Me? No. Well, I am.

799
00:38:14.283 --> 00:38:17.504
I just... I guess
the brain is... is my muscle.


800
00:38:17.591 --> 00:38:19.375
That's...
that's what I use most.


801
00:38:19.506 --> 00:38:20.637
Hmm.

802
00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:22.596
Hey, listen,
about the whole tutoring thing,


803
00:38:22.726 --> 00:38:24.641
I... I just wanted to say
I never meant


804
00:38:24.772 --> 00:38:26.426
to get between you and your son.

805
00:38:26.513 --> 00:38:29.298
I'm sorry about that. I... I...
I should tell you, though,


806
00:38:29.385 --> 00:38:32.475
I feel pretty confident
I could get him to pass.


807
00:38:32.997 --> 00:38:35.086
You can waste my son's time
as much as you want.


808
00:38:36.044 --> 00:38:38.916
Just as long as you
stay out of Sophie's way.


809
00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:42.659
Oh, wow! There's the other leg.
You're good at that!


810
00:38:44.444 --> 00:38:47.185
Not now, Coucou, please!
I need, like, five minutes.


811
00:38:47.316 --> 00:38:48.535
Please, Coucou.

812
00:38:50.188 --> 00:38:51.929
Coucou, can we please
be friends?


813
00:38:54.845 --> 00:38:56.107
Stay, Coucou!

814
00:38:57.457 --> 00:38:58.762
I want you to stay!

815
00:39:05.769 --> 00:39:07.075
Stupid goddamn bag!

816
00:39:07.815 --> 00:39:09.077
Hey, Gordie!

817
00:39:09.164 --> 00:39:12.167
Hey! Hey! I think you won.
[IN FRENCH] What?

818
00:39:12.254 --> 00:39:13.690
I think you kicked its ass.

819
00:39:13.777 --> 00:39:15.170
Hold on.
Let me turn this down.


820
00:39:15.257 --> 00:39:16.650
This is an awesome setup, man.

821
00:39:16.737 --> 00:39:19.043
You got dojo.
You got man cave.


822
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:20.131
You never need to leave!

823
00:39:20.349 --> 00:39:21.742
Sorry about the flies.

824
00:39:22.264 --> 00:39:23.874
It used to be a...

825
00:39:24.092 --> 00:39:26.050
Chicken house.
- Oh, it was a chicken coop.


826
00:39:26.529 --> 00:39:28.444
Huh. Well,
they were living well.


827
00:39:28.966 --> 00:39:30.664
Oh, sure. It's noon somewhere.

828
00:39:32.143 --> 00:39:34.319
Hey, uh, I wanna
really apologize


829
00:39:34.407 --> 00:39:36.060
to you about last night, man.
I didn't mean to


830
00:39:36.147 --> 00:39:38.106
let the cat out of the bag.
Don't worry about it.


831
00:39:38.541 --> 00:39:40.108
I don't care what he thinks.
It's my life.


832
00:39:40.456 --> 00:39:41.501
Yeah, I get it.

833
00:39:41.588 --> 00:39:43.111
My father wanted me
to be a dentist, so...


834
00:39:43.198 --> 00:39:44.721
Of course, my father
is a whole lot less intimidating


835
00:39:44.852 --> 00:39:46.549
than yours,
so it was an easier no.


836
00:39:46.854 --> 00:39:48.464
You look
like a dentist.


837
00:39:48.551 --> 00:39:49.552
Thank you.

838
00:39:49.813 --> 00:39:51.598
I don't have
any cash to pay you,


839
00:39:51.728 --> 00:39:53.687
but I could give you
Muay Thai lessons.


840
00:39:53.774 --> 00:39:55.210
No, it's my pleasure, man.

841
00:39:55.297 --> 00:39:56.472
Please. What else am I gonna do?

842
00:39:56.559 --> 00:39:57.604
I'm happy to help.

843
00:39:57.734 --> 00:40:00.868
But I actually wouldn't mind
a little intel


844
00:40:00.955 --> 00:40:02.522
on your sister and Ruby.

845
00:40:02.652 --> 00:40:04.175
Dammit, Juliette...

846
00:40:04.262 --> 00:40:05.307
No, it wasn't her.

847
00:40:05.655 --> 00:40:06.874
I stumbled across a picture

848
00:40:06.961 --> 00:40:08.528
where they looked
a little, uh...


849
00:40:11.226 --> 00:40:13.097
Don't do that
with your fingers.


850
00:40:13.402 --> 00:40:14.925
Do you know
who broke up with who?


851
00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:17.188
Whom? It's actually "whom."

852
00:40:17.275 --> 00:40:19.190
Who broke up with whom.
[IN FRENCH] What?

853
00:40:19.321 --> 00:40:20.975
We'll get to
"whom." That's advanced.


854
00:40:21.062 --> 00:40:22.672
That's like, double
black diamond. Back to Ruby.


855
00:40:22.846 --> 00:40:24.282
Sophie was crazy about her.

856
00:40:24.369 --> 00:40:27.198
But Ruby cheated a few times,
and Sophie caught her.


857
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:29.374
She was heartbroken.

858
00:40:29.636 --> 00:40:31.159
I didn't get all
of that. You speak very fast.


859
00:40:31.246 --> 00:40:34.205
But I think you said it was Ruby
who was the heartbreaker.


860
00:40:34.336 --> 00:40:35.337
Fuck yeah.

861
00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:38.079
Hey, don't worry about it, man.

862
00:40:38.166 --> 00:40:40.081
She needs a guy who's...

863
00:40:40.516 --> 00:40:41.735
...boring like you.

864
00:40:42.213 --> 00:40:44.738
Oh. By the way,
great pronunciation!


865
00:40:44.825 --> 00:40:45.913
Really?

866
00:40:46.304 --> 00:40:48.524
I don't think I have the brain
to learn a new language.


867
00:40:48.655 --> 00:40:51.135
The key is just
to find a way into the material.


868
00:40:51.484 --> 00:40:54.095
And for you, I think
I have the perfect way in.


869
00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:57.141
Huh.

870
00:40:59.709 --> 00:41:01.363
<i>You wanna see
some real fighting,</i>


871
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:02.930
<i>you can see me fight
at the kumite.</i>


872
00:41:03.191 --> 00:41:04.627
<i>I'm here, too, for the kumite.</i>

873
00:41:04.888 --> 00:41:06.847
<i>Aren't you a little young
for full contact?</i>


874
00:41:07.587 --> 00:41:10.241
<i>Aren't you a little old
for video games?</i>


875
00:41:10.372 --> 00:41:11.721
Okay, so in that example,

876
00:41:11.852 --> 00:41:14.463
"aren't" is a contraction
of "are" and "not."


877
00:41:14.637 --> 00:41:18.249
"Aren't you a little old
for video games?"


878
00:41:18.336 --> 00:41:20.861
That's perfect.
You sound just like Van Damme.


879
00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:22.602
Can we watch
the fight scenes?


880
00:41:22.689 --> 00:41:24.647
Actually, that will
help us with imperative verbs.


881
00:41:24.778 --> 00:41:26.127
I bet there's plenty in there.

882
00:41:26.301 --> 00:41:28.085
See, that's the thing
about a muscadet.


883
00:41:28.216 --> 00:41:31.045
It's arrogant, yet subtle.

884
00:41:31.306 --> 00:41:33.438
A perfect pairing
for my mozzarella balloons,


885
00:41:33.787 --> 00:41:35.353
which you killed today.

886
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.355
I didn't come here
to fuck spiders.


887
00:41:37.704 --> 00:41:40.228
I hope no one came here
to fuck spiders.


888
00:41:40.445 --> 00:41:42.273
Is that, like, an expression

889
00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.058
from...
...Down Under?


890
00:41:44.798 --> 00:41:46.277
You know what? Never mind.
I don't care.


891
00:41:46.451 --> 00:41:48.323
Malcolm, let's move on
to the reds.


892
00:41:48.584 --> 00:41:51.413
[IN FRENCH] Watch this!

893
00:41:52.501 --> 00:41:53.807
Powder to the eyes?

894
00:41:53.894 --> 00:41:54.895
That doesn't seem fair.

895
00:41:55.286 --> 00:41:56.723
He's blind!
Can't see shit! But wait.


896
00:41:56.853 --> 00:41:58.376
That's the thing
about the kumite.


897
00:41:58.768 --> 00:41:59.769
There's no rules.

898
00:42:01.728 --> 00:42:04.165
All his memories
from Japan with his sensei.


899
00:42:05.819 --> 00:42:07.168
Now he's in the zone.

900
00:42:07.342 --> 00:42:08.386
Check the kick!

901
00:42:08.517 --> 00:42:09.736
Uh-oh! Gunshot!

902
00:42:09.953 --> 00:42:12.260
- Oh, ho, ho, ho!
- Wow!


903
00:42:13.783 --> 00:42:15.611
- Boom!
-Triple kick?


904
00:42:19.833 --> 00:42:21.530
Every time![IN ENGLISH] Yeah!

905
00:42:25.403 --> 00:42:27.580
I'm sorry for being
so hard on you.


906
00:42:27.754 --> 00:42:30.234
But I'm not gonna
play favorites.


907
00:42:30.408 --> 00:42:32.976
I brought you here
because of your talent,


908
00:42:33.716 --> 00:42:35.588
not because of our history.

909
00:42:35.805 --> 00:42:37.502
- Thanks for saying that.
- Anytime.


910
00:42:41.289 --> 00:42:43.683
There's also something else
I need to apologize for.


911
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:48.426
Oh, no, no. You don't need
- to apologize anymore.
- No, I do. I do.


912
00:42:50.515 --> 00:42:52.822
I've been talking a lot
with Brené Brown


913
00:42:52.909 --> 00:42:54.215
about accountability.

914
00:42:55.303 --> 00:42:58.306
Which I need to own
for how things ended between us.


915
00:42:58.523 --> 00:43:00.961
I let my ego
get the best of me.

916
00:43:01.657 --> 00:43:04.355
You deserved so much better.

917
00:43:06.662 --> 00:43:08.925
Which you seem to have found
in Gordon.


918
00:43:09.491 --> 00:43:10.797
It all worked out
for the best.


919
00:43:11.928 --> 00:43:16.716
Like you said, I found Gordon.
And you! I mean, you--


920
00:43:16.803 --> 00:43:18.282
Look at everything
you've accomplished.


921
00:43:18.543 --> 00:43:19.849
Yeah, I suppose.

922
00:43:19.936 --> 00:43:21.459
You have one of the biggest
cooking shows.


923
00:43:21.546 --> 00:43:23.244
You have, what, like,
three bestsellers.


924
00:43:23.374 --> 00:43:26.290
And are you actually starting
a makeup line?


925
00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:28.815
It's not bad for the daughter
of a Filipina immigrant.


926
00:43:28.945 --> 00:43:32.427
Damn right!

927
00:43:35.517 --> 00:43:37.650
So, is it weird being
back home after so long?


928
00:43:40.087 --> 00:43:42.045
My dad might have to
sell the farm.


929
00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:44.178
Oh, Soph, I'm so sorry.

930
00:43:44.613 --> 00:43:47.268
- It's his entire life, you know?
- Yeah.


931
00:43:48.051 --> 00:43:49.966
But he's stubborn enough.
I mean, you know him. He'll...


932
00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.403
...he'll figure
something out.


933
00:43:53.796 --> 00:43:57.452
Let's get you another drink.
You look like you need it.


934
00:43:59.193 --> 00:44:00.368
I think I need to get home.

935
00:44:01.325 --> 00:44:03.284
I wasn't asking, babe.

936
00:44:03.893 --> 00:44:06.461
This is work, not play.

937
00:44:06.853 --> 00:44:08.202
Oh.  Of course.

938
00:44:08.593 --> 00:44:10.378
- Malcolm!
-[IN FRENCH] Yes?


939
00:44:10.683 --> 00:44:11.727
Can we taste another?

940
00:44:11.858 --> 00:44:13.686
-[IN FRENCH] Right away.
- Perfect.


941
00:44:29.614 --> 00:44:30.746
Ahoy!

942
00:44:31.747 --> 00:44:35.142
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to wake you.


943
00:44:35.316 --> 00:44:37.622
It's okay. I wasn't sleeping.

944
00:44:39.668 --> 00:44:40.756
You were out late.

945
00:44:40.843 --> 00:44:43.367
Yeah, I, uh,
I should have texted.


946
00:44:44.107 --> 00:44:46.370
Ruby had us trying
a bunch of wine pairings.


947
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:50.113
How was your day?
- Oh, my day was great!


948
00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.073
I, um, I slaughtered
a little baby lamb


949
00:44:53.247 --> 00:44:56.119
with your father,
and I tutored your brother.


950
00:44:56.337 --> 00:44:57.730
Oh, and I also found out

951
00:44:57.817 --> 00:44:59.340
that you and Ruby
used to be lovers.


952
00:44:59.427 --> 00:45:02.038
So, all in all,
a pretty full day.


953
00:45:09.742 --> 00:45:11.439
Okay, I really
wanted to tell you.


954
00:45:11.526 --> 00:45:13.049
But I knew you would worry... 
GORDON: Don't try.

955
00:45:13.136 --> 00:45:14.572
...and I didn't want you
to worry... GORDON: No.


956
00:45:14.659 --> 00:45:16.183
- Please.
-...and turn it
into something it's not,


957
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:17.314
because it's really nothing.

958
00:45:17.793 --> 00:45:19.186
Oh, it's definitely something.
It's definitely something.


959
00:45:19.273 --> 00:45:21.710
It's a fairly large omission,
don't you think?


960
00:45:21.797 --> 00:45:23.973
Working for your ex?

961
00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:26.193
Definitely should have
factored into the conversation.


962
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.672
I'm sorry. You're right.

963
00:45:27.803 --> 00:45:31.415
I should have been up front.
But it was years ago.


964
00:45:31.502 --> 00:45:34.070
I mean, she was an asshole then.
She's an asshole now.


965
00:45:34.157 --> 00:45:36.420
Well, she seemed pretty darn
charming the other night.


966
00:45:36.681 --> 00:45:38.379
It's all a show. 
She's a tyrant.

967
00:45:39.075 --> 00:45:41.730
I don't care that she's my ex.

968
00:45:42.252 --> 00:45:43.297
And you shouldn't either.

969
00:45:43.601 --> 00:45:45.168
Well, it's easier said than done
when she looks like


970
00:45:45.255 --> 00:45:50.260
- the future of the human race.
- Hey, come on. Look at me.


971
00:45:52.654 --> 00:45:53.786
I love you.

972
00:45:55.613 --> 00:45:58.051
- And I want you.
- No, don't try.


973
00:45:58.181 --> 00:46:01.010
You're not gonna win me back
by trying to have sex with me.


974
00:46:01.141 --> 00:46:02.795
Just make out
with me a little.


975
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:04.405
Come on, love.

976
00:46:04.927 --> 00:46:07.930
I'm not that easily convinced.

977
00:46:08.017 --> 00:46:10.628
Can I convince you with
that thing I do to your toes?


978
00:46:10.933 --> 00:46:15.068
Well, that could definitely
expedite the healing process.


979
00:46:15.982 --> 00:46:17.287
Mm.

980
00:46:18.985 --> 00:46:21.726
Wait. Ah,
this really hurts my legs.


981
00:46:21.944 --> 00:46:23.946
This is--No, it'll work, baby.
Let me just anchor.


982
00:46:24.033 --> 00:46:25.905
If I anchor my leg... Here.

983
00:46:26.035 --> 00:46:28.995
I'll just put my hand there.
I'm like an isosceles triangle.


984
00:46:29.082 --> 00:46:31.475
This is so comfy.
Just give me a second, okay?


985
00:46:31.562 --> 00:46:32.737
Yeah, but hold on. Wait.

986
00:46:32.825 --> 00:46:34.087
We're locked
and loaded here, babe.


987
00:46:34.174 --> 00:46:35.349
We don't need a second.

988
00:46:35.653 --> 00:46:37.830
If you take too many seconds,
you might fall asleep.


989
00:46:40.093 --> 00:46:41.137
Babe?

990
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:55.151
Gordon?

991
00:46:58.328 --> 00:47:00.591
Alphonse, <i>bonjour! Café?</i>

992
00:47:00.853 --> 00:47:03.203
- I assume you take it black.
- Hmm.


993
00:47:03.768 --> 00:47:05.988
Gordon, wow! You're up early.

994
00:47:06.075 --> 00:47:08.643
Yeah, I'm just excited.
Uh, beautiful day.


995
00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:11.167
Hey, I wanted to ask if I could
drive Sophie in to work today,


996
00:47:11.254 --> 00:47:12.865
maybe see some of the sights,
and then I'll...


997
00:47:12.952 --> 00:47:14.736
- I'll bring her home?
- Of course!


998
00:47:14.823 --> 00:47:16.303
Keys are hanging
by the front door.


999
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:18.348
- Great.
-No,
that's not a good idea.


1000
00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:20.873
It's an old truck, you know.
It's hard to handle.


1001
00:47:21.003 --> 00:47:23.745
Well, you should try
biking in Brooklyn. It's crazy!


1002
00:47:23.919 --> 00:47:26.443
And then, Manhattan,
that's like, um...


1003
00:47:26.574 --> 00:47:30.099
But, uh, truck-wise, as long as
it's not manual, I'm good to go.


1004
00:47:30.708 --> 00:47:32.841
- There's no gas.
- I'll fill her up.


1005
00:47:32.928 --> 00:47:33.929
Is that okay?

1006
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.323
Absolutely. Right, Alphonse?

1007
00:47:36.671 --> 00:47:37.802
Mm.

1008
00:47:37.977 --> 00:47:39.065
<i>This is fun,</i>

1009
00:47:39.152 --> 00:47:41.589
<i>driving my love
along the riverbanks.</i>


1010
00:47:42.416 --> 00:47:43.765
Babe... Mm.

1011
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.942
Can you please just...
just go faster.


1012
00:47:47.073 --> 00:47:50.641
As my late mother used to say,
"Under 45, you stay alive."


1013
00:47:50.815 --> 00:47:52.208
I knew I should have driven.

1014
00:47:52.382 --> 00:47:53.601
You are not driving.
Are you kidding me?


1015
00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.169
You probably still have alcohol
in your blood. You'd get a DUI.


1016
00:47:56.343 --> 00:47:58.345
This is a good pace
for us, okay?


1017
00:47:58.475 --> 00:48:00.913
I'm not getting in an accident
in your father's beloved car.


1018
00:48:01.043 --> 00:48:02.044
It's here.

1019
00:48:02.131 --> 00:48:03.219
- What's here?
- Here, here.


1020
00:48:03.306 --> 00:48:04.394
The exit. You're gonna miss it.

1021
00:48:04.655 --> 00:48:06.527
Well, you gotta tell me
sooner than that, baby.


1022
00:48:06.657 --> 00:48:08.616
- Oh, my God, we missed it!
- Well...


1023
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:10.923
There was a motorcyclist
in the lane, babe!


1024
00:48:11.053 --> 00:48:12.489
This takes us onto the bridge.

1025
00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.274
Do you know how late
I'm gonna be?


1026
00:48:14.622 --> 00:48:16.493
You will not be
one second late.


1027
00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.627
Move your fucking horse!

1028
00:48:19.714 --> 00:48:21.194
Come on, for God's sake.

1029
00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:22.935
Stupid Saint
-Laurent.

1030
00:48:23.065 --> 00:48:25.067
Sweetheart, I'm sorry,
but the GPS did not account


1031
00:48:25.154 --> 00:48:26.416
for exhausted Seabiscuit.

1032
00:48:26.503 --> 00:48:28.375
Don't honk at a horse!

1033
00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:30.246
That's a thing, I'm sure.

1034
00:48:30.377 --> 00:48:31.856
You know what?
Screw this. I'm gonna run.


1035
00:48:31.987 --> 00:48:33.728
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait.

1036
00:48:33.858 --> 00:48:35.338
-Bye.
-Babe!


1037
00:48:35.469 --> 00:48:36.818
I'm sorry. I love you!

1038
00:48:40.909 --> 00:48:43.303
Oh! Well, look who decided
to join us.


1039
00:48:43.477 --> 00:48:44.782
I'm so sorry, chef.

1040
00:48:44.869 --> 00:48:47.089
Come in late again,
and you're out.


1041
00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:50.875
Hey! Whoa! Look at this place!

1042
00:48:50.963 --> 00:48:52.703
It's like the kitchen
on the Death Star.


1043
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:55.489
This is incredible! Is this
where Vader gets his Pop Tarts?


1044
00:48:55.619 --> 00:48:57.230
Can I help you?

1045
00:48:57.317 --> 00:48:59.623
Ruby, I am so sorry. I just
want to be the one to tell you


1046
00:48:59.754 --> 00:49:02.017
that Sophie's tardiness
is 100% my fault.


1047
00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:04.280
I had to put gas
in her father's car.


1048
00:49:04.367 --> 00:49:05.368
Can you believe it takes diesel?

1049
00:49:05.586 --> 00:49:07.370
I'm about to put regular
in the wagon here,


1050
00:49:07.762 --> 00:49:09.982
and a guy calls me
a <i>câlice de tabarnak,</i>


1051
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:12.158
which I thought was an insult.
Turns out, I google it...


1052
00:49:12.245 --> 00:49:13.637
Is it bring your boyfriend
to work day,


1053
00:49:13.724 --> 00:49:16.249
or is he gonna kindly
get the fuck out of my kitchen?


1054
00:49:16.423 --> 00:49:18.077
- Gordon, please.
-I'm so sorry.


1055
00:49:18.207 --> 00:49:19.904
Boyfriend reads you
loud and clear.


1056
00:49:20.209 --> 00:49:21.819
I'll let you coworkers
do your thing.


1057
00:49:21.906 --> 00:49:23.082
You guys are screwed.

1058
00:49:23.212 --> 00:49:25.040
You're gonna win, baby!
Team Sophie!


1059
00:49:37.661 --> 00:49:39.359
Smoked pine needles.

1060
00:49:40.142 --> 00:49:42.884
When I got home last night,
the air just hit me.


1061
00:49:43.015 --> 00:49:46.366
It was almost sweet.
It smelled like Christmas.


1062
00:49:47.497 --> 00:49:50.022
I thought it would complement
your smoked oysters.


1063
00:49:50.718 --> 00:49:52.154
Give it a distinct
local essence.


1064
00:49:52.285 --> 00:49:54.852
That is what
I'm talking about, Sophie.


1065
00:49:54.983 --> 00:49:56.202
Good work.

1066
00:49:58.204 --> 00:49:59.292
Stop looking!

1067
00:49:59.379 --> 00:50:01.294
I didn't look.
It's your turn.


1068
00:50:01.424 --> 00:50:03.426
Mammie has to draw.

1069
00:50:03.557 --> 00:50:05.950
Organize them by suit.

1070
00:50:06.864 --> 00:50:08.692
Not too bored,
Gordon?


1071
00:50:09.171 --> 00:50:11.173
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
I'm having the best time.


1072
00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.697
I get to hang out with three
lovely Tremblay ladies


1073
00:50:13.784 --> 00:50:15.003
instead of just one.

1074
00:50:15.438 --> 00:50:16.961
Plus I'm sure Sophie
will be home soon.


1075
00:50:17.092 --> 00:50:18.615
I don't know about that.

1076
00:50:20.139 --> 00:50:23.403
- What don't you know about?
- Ah!  It's just...


1077
00:50:24.186 --> 00:50:25.883
When Sophie and Ruby
were together,


1078
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:27.537
it was like Burning Man
every night.


1079
00:50:28.234 --> 00:50:29.235
So fun.

1080
00:50:29.322 --> 00:50:30.671
Juliette...[IN FRENCH] What? It's true.

1081
00:50:30.758 --> 00:50:33.326
I lost my virginity
to a Jewish boy.


1082
00:50:34.153 --> 00:50:35.850
- Mazel tov.
- Mammie...


1083
00:50:37.373 --> 00:50:40.072
Uno!
We're playing hearts, Mammie.


1084
00:50:41.682 --> 00:50:43.510
Holy shit!
- What's wrong?


1085
00:50:43.901 --> 00:50:46.078
Um, will you excuse me
for just one second?


1086
00:50:46.208 --> 00:50:48.950
I have to, uh,
use the facilities upstairs.


1087
00:50:49.124 --> 00:50:51.039
Oh, but there's
a bathroom right there.


1088
00:50:51.866 --> 00:50:55.696
Oh, but it's a
<i>petit numéro due...</i>


1089
00:50:55.913 --> 00:50:57.524
Gross.

1090
00:50:57.741 --> 00:50:59.352
He's going for a poop?

1091
00:51:05.662 --> 00:51:06.794
No!

1092
00:51:10.058 --> 00:51:13.061
You and I haven't really had
a chance to just chat alone yet,


1093
00:51:13.192 --> 00:51:14.193
have we, Mammie?

1094
00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:16.325
The Russians
are sending a dog into space.


1095
00:51:16.412 --> 00:51:17.718
Yeah, well, they're--

1096
00:51:17.805 --> 00:51:19.285
They're always
doing something up there.


1097
00:51:20.199 --> 00:51:21.243
Um...

1098
00:51:21.852 --> 00:51:24.507
If we could just chat
for a second about the ring.


1099
00:51:24.725 --> 00:51:26.292
That's my great-grandmother's.

1100
00:51:26.379 --> 00:51:28.816
And I'm... I'm sensitive
to your condition, I really am,


1101
00:51:28.903 --> 00:51:30.470
so, no hard feelings.

1102
00:51:30.731 --> 00:51:34.082
But I'm just gonna reach down
and take my ring back, okay?


1103
00:51:34.256 --> 00:51:35.779
So I'm gonna just grab it.

1104
00:51:37.303 --> 00:51:38.782
- Gordie!
- Hey, man!


1105
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.002
Ditch the old ladies
and come get a drink
with the boys.


1106
00:51:41.089 --> 00:51:43.178
No, I'm fine.
I'm hanging out with the ladies.


1107
00:51:43.265 --> 00:51:44.310
I'm having a blast.

1108
00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.615
Trust me,
you want to come.


1109
00:51:45.963 --> 00:51:48.096
That's a great idea
you should go and have fun.


1110
00:51:48.444 --> 00:51:49.880
Come on, dude.

1111
00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:52.840
Okay, well...

1112
00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:54.755
To be continued!

1113
00:51:55.973 --> 00:51:57.671
What are we drinking next?

1114
00:51:57.975 --> 00:51:59.977
- Shots!
- Fucking shooters, mate.


1115
00:52:00.239 --> 00:52:02.241
Look, quality is everything.

1116
00:52:02.371 --> 00:52:04.634
And if that means importing
my lamb from New Zealand,


1117
00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:05.853
then that's what
I'm going to do.


1118
00:52:06.027 --> 00:52:08.377
Are you saying that the lamb
from my father's farm


1119
00:52:08.464 --> 00:52:10.074
is not as good as New Zealand's?

1120
00:52:10.162 --> 00:52:12.555
Well.  I mean,
the difference might be slim,


1121
00:52:12.642 --> 00:52:15.254
but it is the difference between
excellence and perfection.


1122
00:52:15.341 --> 00:52:16.994
Yeah, just like
the slim difference


1123
00:52:17.081 --> 00:52:18.779
between being arrogant
and being full of shit?


1124
00:52:18.866 --> 00:52:20.346
Well,
someone is confident.


1125
00:52:20.476 --> 00:52:21.869
Yeah, 'cause I...

1126
00:52:22.086 --> 00:52:24.915
...I swapped out your lamb today
with meat from my father's farm,


1127
00:52:25.089 --> 00:52:26.874
and someone
didn't seem to notice.


1128
00:52:28.571 --> 00:52:31.052
You absolute assassin.

1129
00:52:36.971 --> 00:52:38.015
Hey!

1130
00:52:39.669 --> 00:52:42.498
Yo! Hey, Jordan, <i>ostie!</i>

1131
00:52:42.803 --> 00:52:43.847
It's Gordon.

1132
00:52:43.934 --> 00:52:45.980
Put her in
a triangle choke!


1133
00:52:49.679 --> 00:52:50.767
Oh!

1134
00:52:51.246 --> 00:52:54.336
You hear that?
That's bone. That's a bone.


1135
00:52:54.423 --> 00:52:57.252
Give it up for Daphne
the Dolphin Tousignon!


1136
00:52:57.383 --> 00:52:58.558
Daphne!

1137
00:52:59.341 --> 00:53:00.647
I love you!

1138
00:53:00.777 --> 00:53:02.083
Is someone gonna help her?

1139
00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:03.563
I'm surprised to see you here.

1140
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:06.130
Oh no, I love it. I love it.
I love violence of any kind.


1141
00:53:06.305 --> 00:53:08.307
Uh, yeah. Pain is my jam.

1142
00:53:08.437 --> 00:53:09.873
And now...

1143
00:53:10.222 --> 00:53:11.397
Light change.

1144
00:53:11.875 --> 00:53:13.312
...he's big, he's mean
and he's ugly.


1145
00:53:13.399 --> 00:53:15.052
The prince of Granby,

1146
00:53:15.662 --> 00:53:18.882
Tony Tonka Begin.

1147
00:53:19.013 --> 00:53:20.667
Look at the size of that guy!

1148
00:53:21.885 --> 00:53:24.932
Versus the undefeated champion,
from Quebec...


1149
00:53:25.062 --> 00:53:27.413
He's pointing
at me. I didn't do anything!


1150
00:53:27.848 --> 00:53:31.895
Junior Trauma Tremblay!

1151
00:53:32.548 --> 00:53:34.942
Come on!
- You're fighting?


1152
00:53:35.247 --> 00:53:38.162
Every Saturday.
Gotta pay the rent.


1153
00:53:38.902 --> 00:53:40.077
Him?

1154
00:53:40.948 --> 00:53:44.386
Are you out of your mind?

1155
00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.258
He's like white Shrek!

1156
00:53:46.388 --> 00:53:47.433
Let's go!

1157
00:53:51.567 --> 00:53:53.003
Ready?

1158
00:53:54.004 --> 00:53:55.179
Fight!

1159
00:54:01.795 --> 00:54:03.840
- Whoa! That was good, huh?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!


1160
00:54:07.931 --> 00:54:09.542
<i>Oui!</i>

1161
00:54:15.635 --> 00:54:16.853
Oh!

1162
00:54:17.637 --> 00:54:20.553
Fuck yes! David beats Goliath!

1163
00:54:23.599 --> 00:54:25.601
Junior Trauma Tremblay!

1164
00:54:26.472 --> 00:54:27.473
That's my cousin!

1165
00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:28.865
Ladies and gentlemen,

1166
00:54:28.996 --> 00:54:32.739
we have a challenger!

1167
00:54:34.218 --> 00:54:35.568
He's gonna fight somebody else?

1168
00:54:35.785 --> 00:54:41.313
Alphonse the Butcher Tremblay!

1169
00:54:42.096 --> 00:54:44.577
Oh fuck, yes!

1170
00:54:44.707 --> 00:54:46.535
Last time they fought,
they ended up in jail, man.


1171
00:54:46.666 --> 00:54:47.884
Are you kidding me?

1172
00:54:49.364 --> 00:54:50.974
They can't fight.
They're family.


1173
00:54:51.148 --> 00:54:52.236
They're Tremblays.

1174
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:59.200
If I win, you stay
and work on the farm.


1175
00:54:59.722 --> 00:55:02.899
If you win, you can take
your little English test.


1176
00:55:03.204 --> 00:55:04.336
Bring it on, old man.

1177
00:55:04.423 --> 00:55:06.033
I'm gonna wipe
the floor with you.


1178
00:55:07.077 --> 00:55:08.383
No, false alarm!

1179
00:55:08.514 --> 00:55:11.255
Intermission! Intermission!

1180
00:55:11.386 --> 00:55:15.042
Call it off! Call it off, sorry!
Sorry, you guys cannot fight.


1181
00:55:15.172 --> 00:55:16.348
Stay out of it.

1182
00:55:16.609 --> 00:55:17.958
No, this is my
fault. I'm sorry. My fault.


1183
00:55:18.262 --> 00:55:19.916
All good.
Violence is not the answer.


1184
00:55:20.090 --> 00:55:22.266
- Think of Sophie, of Ginette.
- It's okay!


1185
00:55:22.397 --> 00:55:23.616
It gonna end up in two seconds.

1186
00:55:24.094 --> 00:55:25.748
No.
There's not gonna be a fight.[IN FRENCH] Two seconds?


1187
00:55:25.879 --> 00:55:27.402
You'll be on the floor
in a second![IN ENGLISH] Just stop!


1188
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.146
Decent knockout.

1189
00:55:32.276 --> 00:55:34.278
No!

1190
00:55:35.279 --> 00:55:38.718
Yeah!

1191
00:55:39.283 --> 00:55:40.894
Are you sure
you don't want to go


1192
00:55:41.024 --> 00:55:43.592
- to the hospital?
- No. No, no.


1193
00:55:44.114 --> 00:55:45.681
It's just a little headache.

1194
00:55:45.768 --> 00:55:47.422
Again,
I'm so sorry, Alphonse.


1195
00:55:47.509 --> 00:55:49.685
No, no, don't be sorry.
It's their fault.


1196
00:55:49.859 --> 00:55:51.078
Mom...

1197
00:55:51.426 --> 00:55:53.776
- But Gordon did knock him out.
- Very accidentally.


1198
00:55:53.907 --> 00:55:55.125
Still, you delivered the blow.

1199
00:55:55.212 --> 00:55:57.084
The good news is
that father and son


1200
00:55:57.171 --> 00:55:59.042
avoided going at it
in the kumite.


1201
00:55:59.129 --> 00:56:00.392
I have even better news.

1202
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:02.089
I have a surprise

1203
00:56:02.219 --> 00:56:04.439
that will certainly
get you fixed up in no time.


1204
00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.007
Drum roll.

1205
00:56:07.094 --> 00:56:08.487
It's an expression.
You don't...


1206
00:56:08.661 --> 00:56:10.227
I have spoken to the network,

1207
00:56:10.576 --> 00:56:13.143
and we would be thrilled
to shoot an episode


1208
00:56:13.274 --> 00:56:17.321
of <i>Ruby in Your Pantry</i>
right here on your family farm!


1209
00:56:17.539 --> 00:56:19.411
I mean, great exposure
for the greatest lamb


1210
00:56:19.498 --> 00:56:22.065
- in the world. Am I right?
- I don't know what to say!


1211
00:56:22.196 --> 00:56:23.502
Well, say <i>oui, ma chérie!</i>

1212
00:56:23.589 --> 00:56:24.851
Thank you so much!

1213
00:56:25.025 --> 00:56:26.113
Wow...

1214
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.680
- Wow!
-Thank you so much!


1215
00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:31.727
- Can I be on TV, too?
- Oh, but of course,
it's your farm!


1216
00:56:31.945 --> 00:56:34.077
[IN FRENCH] This is
the best news in the world.


1217
00:56:34.643 --> 00:56:35.992
You have to lend me
some clothes.


1218
00:56:37.254 --> 00:56:38.734
I'm excited about it, too.

1219
00:56:42.172 --> 00:56:43.696
Of course she drives a Jag.

1220
00:56:44.218 --> 00:56:46.873
Bye! Love your pirate's blouse.

1221
00:56:50.398 --> 00:56:51.530
Wow!

1222
00:56:51.704 --> 00:56:53.532
This turned out to be
such a great night, right?


1223
00:56:53.619 --> 00:56:54.620
Oh, it was fabulous!

1224
00:56:54.794 --> 00:56:56.273
You got drunk
with your ex-girlfriend,


1225
00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.797
and I knocked out your father.

1226
00:56:58.493 --> 00:56:59.973
- And that's my fault?
-Yeah, it is.


1227
00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.714
Because if you hadn't
stood me up again,


1228
00:57:01.801 --> 00:57:02.889
I wouldn't have been invited

1229
00:57:03.106 --> 00:57:05.413
to family fucking fight club
or whatever that was.


1230
00:57:05.544 --> 00:57:07.720
Okay, you know what?
I don't want to do this tonight.


1231
00:57:07.807 --> 00:57:09.286
Well, you know what? I do.

1232
00:57:10.287 --> 00:57:12.420
I'm just saying, if you look
at things from my point of view,


1233
00:57:12.507 --> 00:57:13.943
it feels like I can't
do anything right,


1234
00:57:14.291 --> 00:57:16.685
unlike Ruby, who can do
absolutely no wrong.


1235
00:57:16.816 --> 00:57:18.339
I can't believe
you're making this about you


1236
00:57:18.426 --> 00:57:20.950
when her show can save this farm
from going out of business.


1237
00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:22.430
Going out of business?
What are you talking about?


1238
00:57:22.561 --> 00:57:24.301
- Going out of business?
- My dad told me


1239
00:57:24.432 --> 00:57:26.565
that they're on the brink
of bankruptcy, okay?


1240
00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:28.262
Ruby is just trying to help.

1241
00:57:28.349 --> 00:57:30.133
So, you told Ruby,
but you didn't tell me?


1242
00:57:30.264 --> 00:57:32.048
I've been spending
more time with her.


1243
00:57:32.135 --> 00:57:33.441
I haven't seen you
as much, come on.


1244
00:57:33.528 --> 00:57:34.877
Really?
I hadn't noticed.


1245
00:57:34.964 --> 00:57:36.444
Oh, my God!

1246
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:39.273
All right,
you know what?


1247
00:57:39.403 --> 00:57:41.362
It's been a long week.
Let's just get some sleep.


1248
00:57:41.449 --> 00:57:43.495
You've been reading
way too much into this.


1249
00:57:45.279 --> 00:57:46.672
You're right, I'm sorry.

1250
00:57:48.195 --> 00:57:50.937
I should be happy for you guys.
I didn't know that. I'm sorry.


1251
00:57:51.764 --> 00:57:52.765
I just miss you.

1252
00:57:53.330 --> 00:57:54.593
I miss you too, honey.

1253
00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:57.770
- I love you.
-I love you, too.


1254
00:58:10.391 --> 00:58:12.219
Psst! Hey!

1255
00:58:14.264 --> 00:58:16.702
A big snowstorm
is coming.


1256
00:58:16.876 --> 00:58:18.965
All right, I'll-
I'll take her back to bed.


1257
00:58:19.095 --> 00:58:20.662
No, you know what?
Let me, let me.


1258
00:58:20.793 --> 00:58:21.924
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.


1259
00:58:22.011 --> 00:58:22.882
Come on, you're tired.

1260
00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:24.318
Let me do one thing right
in this house.


1261
00:58:24.405 --> 00:58:25.754
- All right.
- I got it.


1262
00:58:26.450 --> 00:58:27.495
Hey, Mammie.

1263
00:58:28.714 --> 00:58:32.152
Let's get you back to bed
before the storm hits, okay?


1264
00:58:32.544 --> 00:58:33.849
I got you.

1265
00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:35.416
All right, Mammie.

1266
00:58:36.548 --> 00:58:37.853
There you go.

1267
00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:42.249
Time to count some sheep before
your son slaughters them all.


1268
00:58:46.819 --> 00:58:48.647
I do need to get
my ring back, though, Mammie.


1269
00:58:50.344 --> 00:58:51.954
Just while you're dozing...

1270
00:58:58.352 --> 00:58:59.527
Farmer knuckles!

1271
00:59:00.484 --> 00:59:01.616
Come on...

1272
00:59:05.359 --> 00:59:08.710
<i>♪ Dormez-vous, dormez-vous? ♪</i>

1273
00:59:08.797 --> 00:59:12.888
Oh, hey! She wandered
into our room, sweet old gal.


1274
00:59:13.019 --> 00:59:15.282
I think
she was probably sleepwalking.


1275
00:59:16.718 --> 00:59:19.721
I've been tasked
with putting her down again.


1276
00:59:20.243 --> 00:59:25.118
<i>♪ Sonnez les matines
Sonnez les matines ♪</i>


1277
00:59:25.901 --> 00:59:27.729
<i>♪ Ding, dang, dong</i>

1278
00:59:29.426 --> 00:59:31.124
You can close it out
if you want to.


1279
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:33.169
Yeah, yeah,
ding dang dong.


1280
00:59:33.648 --> 00:59:35.868
We did it. We did it.

1281
00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:38.522
Sweet dreams, Mammie.

1282
00:59:39.611 --> 00:59:40.742
I'll just get by you.

1283
00:59:41.264 --> 00:59:42.570
Do you want me
to sing to your baby?


1284
00:59:42.657 --> 00:59:44.006
- Oh, I'm good.
- Okay.


1285
00:59:45.442 --> 00:59:47.531
What a weirdo.

1286
00:59:49.098 --> 00:59:50.273
Oh!

1287
00:59:52.406 --> 00:59:55.322
Gordon's dad writes
with a lot of...


1288
00:59:56.802 --> 00:59:58.194
...eroticism.

1289
01:00:00.806 --> 01:00:03.112
What do you think
of Sophie and Ruby?


1290
01:00:03.678 --> 01:00:07.160
Oh. I think they have a
good professional relationship.


1291
01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:09.684
Not professionally.
You know what I mean.


1292
01:00:10.337 --> 01:00:11.817
They were perfect together.

1293
01:00:11.904 --> 01:00:14.863
No, they weren't
perfect together at all.


1294
01:00:15.516 --> 01:00:17.649
And besides,
Sophie is happy with Gordon.


1295
01:00:18.127 --> 01:00:19.215
Sophie will be happy

1296
01:00:19.302 --> 01:00:20.956
if she gets the job
at the Frontenac.


1297
01:00:21.565 --> 01:00:23.132
Hey, stay out of it.

1298
01:00:24.481 --> 01:00:26.440
Don't look at me like that.
I'm just saying.


1299
01:00:26.527 --> 01:00:27.659
Mm.

1300
01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:34.970
Well, I'm just saying,
when I'm done with Peter's book,


1301
01:00:35.101 --> 01:00:38.931
you should give it a read
and take some notes.


1302
01:00:42.891 --> 01:00:44.284
We gotta talk, Coucou!

1303
01:00:46.025 --> 01:00:47.504
<i>Say it again,</i>

1304
01:00:47.635 --> 01:00:49.028
because I'm totally lost.

1305
01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:50.943
It's a rule of thumb, okay?

1306
01:00:51.552 --> 01:00:54.381
I before E, except after C

1307
01:00:54.903 --> 01:00:58.820
or when sounding as A
as in "Neighbor" or "Weigh."


1308
01:01:00.082 --> 01:01:02.476
You know what? Forget about it.
Can we take a break?


1309
01:01:03.825 --> 01:01:05.435
[IN FRENCH] You okay,
Gordie? You look tired.


1310
01:01:05.566 --> 01:01:06.654
I am tired, man.

1311
01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:08.482
I'm frankly very tired
of my girlfriend


1312
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:09.657
spending every single night

1313
01:01:09.744 --> 01:01:11.224
until 2:00 in the morning
with Ruby,


1314
01:01:11.354 --> 01:01:12.747
drinking and laughing

1315
01:01:12.834 --> 01:01:14.575
and doing all the things
in my mind


1316
01:01:14.662 --> 01:01:16.577
that I pray to God
they're not doing.


1317
01:01:18.448 --> 01:01:19.841
I know a guy.

1318
01:01:19.972 --> 01:01:22.670
For a thousand bucks, he can...

1319
01:01:23.845 --> 01:01:25.629
...smash her legs,

1320
01:01:26.108 --> 01:01:28.110
like, you know,
like Tonya Harding.


1321
01:01:29.721 --> 01:01:31.548
First of all,
very well-crafted sentence.


1322
01:01:32.114 --> 01:01:33.463
But I am gonna pass.

1323
01:01:36.336 --> 01:01:37.380
Hey.

1324
01:01:37.511 --> 01:01:39.774
Guess what? Best news ever!

1325
01:01:39.861 --> 01:01:41.863
Ruby has to do a reshoot
for her show,


1326
01:01:41.994 --> 01:01:45.388
which means
I have the night off.


1327
01:01:45.475 --> 01:01:47.739
<i>Are you serious?</i> Yeah, baby!

1328
01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:51.090
I'm on my way.
Junior, class dismissed.


1329
01:01:51.699 --> 01:01:54.267
Wait, what was
the song with all the letters?


1330
01:02:06.975 --> 01:02:08.281
Pardon me, sir,

1331
01:02:08.803 --> 01:02:09.978
French or English?

1332
01:02:10.065 --> 01:02:12.328
<i>Anglais.</i>[IN ENGLISH] Okay, um...

1333
01:02:12.546 --> 01:02:14.461
would you mind
taking my picture?


1334
01:02:14.548 --> 01:02:16.811
I, uh, I have to send it
to my super-hot boyfriend


1335
01:02:16.942 --> 01:02:18.204
who's been desperately lonely.

1336
01:02:18.291 --> 01:02:21.337
Why don't you forget about him
and fall in love


1337
01:02:21.424 --> 01:02:24.514
with a very handsome
English teacher from Brooklyn?


1338
01:02:24.688 --> 01:02:26.778
Okay!

1339
01:02:27.735 --> 01:02:29.781
You look amazing.
- This is so pretty.
- Thank you,


1340
01:02:29.911 --> 01:02:31.913
- thank you, thank you. So do you.
-Wow!


1341
01:02:32.044 --> 01:02:33.480
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.


1342
01:02:56.459 --> 01:02:58.853
It's not the kind of cooking
I really ever thought I'd do,


1343
01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.725
but I'm getting into it.
And I mean...


1344
01:03:02.552 --> 01:03:05.294
living in this city,
with my family,


1345
01:03:05.425 --> 01:03:06.730
it really would be amazing.

1346
01:03:06.818 --> 01:03:08.167
I think you're
gonna get the job.


1347
01:03:09.429 --> 01:03:12.171
- I don't have it yet.
- Baby, you're gonna get the job.


1348
01:03:12.519 --> 01:03:15.087
Okay,
whatever. Sir...


1349
01:03:15.348 --> 01:03:17.045
I have a surprise
for you.


1350
01:03:18.264 --> 01:03:20.222
I got the Château
to comp us a room tonight.


1351
01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.615
Shut up!

1352
01:03:21.745 --> 01:03:23.225
- Are you serious?
-Mm.


1353
01:03:23.704 --> 01:03:25.619
I am gonna miss sleeping
in that waterbed, though.


1354
01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.621
I don't think we'll be
doing too much sleeping.


1355
01:03:28.013 --> 01:03:29.884
- What are we gonna be doing?
- I don't know.


1356
01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:32.800
Bingeing a series?

1357
01:03:39.372 --> 01:03:40.547
You're gonna love her.

1358
01:03:40.677 --> 01:03:42.462
Did I ever tell you
that she's the first person


1359
01:03:42.549 --> 01:03:43.593
- to make me a sous-chef?
-No.


1360
01:03:43.724 --> 01:03:44.725
Yeah!

1361
01:03:44.812 --> 01:03:47.902
Sophie! <i>Allô!</i>

1362
01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:49.425
You're here!

1363
01:03:50.252 --> 01:03:51.558
You haven't changed a bit.

1364
01:03:51.688 --> 01:03:52.820
You either.

1365
01:03:52.951 --> 01:03:54.691
It's so good to see you.

1366
01:03:54.822 --> 01:03:56.302
I want you
to meet my boyfriend, Gordon. <i>Enchanté.</i>


1367
01:03:56.432 --> 01:03:58.130
A pleasure to meet you.

1368
01:03:58.652 --> 01:04:00.393
- Let me get you a table.
-<i>Merci!</i>


1369
01:04:02.047 --> 01:04:04.136
It's crazy. Nothing's changed!

1370
01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:06.225
<i>Merci! Bon appétit.</i>

1371
01:04:07.313 --> 01:04:10.490
Mm. By the way,
you can order anything you want,


1372
01:04:10.664 --> 01:04:12.971
because dinner is on the house.

1373
01:04:14.189 --> 01:04:15.582
Look at this! What?

1374
01:04:15.712 --> 01:04:18.019
Oh, yay! You know what?

1375
01:04:18.106 --> 01:04:19.194
No, I'll pour it.
You don't have to.


1376
01:04:19.325 --> 01:04:20.543
Thank you so much.
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>


1377
01:04:20.717 --> 01:04:22.502
<i>Merci!</i> Look at you!

1378
01:04:22.676 --> 01:04:27.463
Baby, come on, free champagne
and free dinner, and free hotel.


1379
01:04:27.768 --> 01:04:30.553
I'm blown away. You are
the queen of Quebec City.


1380
01:04:30.814 --> 01:04:33.469
- And you are my king, monsieur.
-Oh, thank you, darling.


1381
01:04:33.905 --> 01:04:38.083
Um, before we toast
to this great night,


1382
01:04:38.344 --> 01:04:39.823
I just wanted to let you know

1383
01:04:39.954 --> 01:04:41.956
that I see how supportive
you've been,


1384
01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:44.437
and it's meant so much to me.

1385
01:04:44.567 --> 01:04:47.831
There you are!
The woman I have been hunting.


1386
01:04:47.919 --> 01:04:50.008
Ruby, I... I thought
you were shooting.


1387
01:04:50.182 --> 01:04:52.445
Oh, that's why they call me
the one-take wonder, darling.


1388
01:04:52.575 --> 01:04:54.360
I spoke to your dad,
and he told me


1389
01:04:54.447 --> 01:04:55.578
you guys
were having dinner here.


1390
01:04:55.796 --> 01:04:58.016
- Oh! <i>Allô,</i> Solange, babe!
- Hi, Ruby!


1391
01:04:58.190 --> 01:05:00.888
I wanted you to meet
my good friend, Avi Donaldson.


1392
01:05:00.975 --> 01:05:02.368
Good friend? Best friend.

1393
01:05:02.629 --> 01:05:04.805
After all the reviews
I've written for her, Jesus.


1394
01:05:05.023 --> 01:05:06.633
It's true.
I'm sorry. My bestie


1395
01:05:06.807 --> 01:05:09.636
and the most important
food critic in London.


1396
01:05:09.766 --> 01:05:11.507
His wit is as cutting
as his reviews.


1397
01:05:11.594 --> 01:05:13.857
Mademoiselle. My God!

1398
01:05:13.988 --> 01:05:16.295
You are even more
stunning than she rhapsodized.


1399
01:05:16.425 --> 01:05:18.079
Obviously,
I've been chatting you up.


1400
01:05:18.427 --> 01:05:20.560
Mind if we join you guys
for a quick drink?


1401
01:05:22.562 --> 01:05:24.956
Um, it's just that-
-It's just that what?

1402
01:05:25.173 --> 01:05:27.436
Nothing. I mean, a drink
sounds really nice,


1403
01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:28.611
right, Gordon?

1404
01:05:28.785 --> 01:05:31.440
It does sound nice,
but this is a two-top,


1405
01:05:31.571 --> 01:05:32.746
and with the fire code,

1406
01:05:32.833 --> 01:05:35.749
I'm a little concerned
about exiting safely.


1407
01:05:35.879 --> 01:05:38.404
Oh, don't worry, Gordie.
We won't stay long.


1408
01:05:38.621 --> 01:05:41.233
He's got a flight to catch.
Carpe diem, as the Latins say.


1409
01:05:41.363 --> 01:05:44.192
- Carpe fucking diem.
- Whoo!  Ladies!


1410
01:05:45.759 --> 01:05:48.544
- Excuse my reach.
- I could have passed it, bro.


1411
01:05:48.675 --> 01:05:50.807
What are we drinking to?

1412
01:05:51.112 --> 01:05:53.593
Well, not to make
tonight about me... Please do.


1413
01:05:53.723 --> 01:05:55.899
I'm about to close
a five-year deal


1414
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:58.554
with a major streamer
who shall remain nameless.


1415
01:05:58.641 --> 01:05:59.642
Rhymes with Petflix.

1416
01:05:59.729 --> 01:06:00.730
Hulu.

1417
01:06:00.817 --> 01:06:02.341
- No, it's Netflix.
- Ah!


1418
01:06:02.471 --> 01:06:05.648
Which will put us in over

1419
01:06:05.909 --> 01:06:07.737
Are you serious?
- That's... that's fantastic!
- Mm-hmm.


1420
01:06:07.868 --> 01:06:09.217
It's bloody brilliant!

1421
01:06:09.348 --> 01:06:10.958
And we are almost out of bubbly.

1422
01:06:11.089 --> 01:06:13.047
Well, we had plenty
until you poured two thermoses


1423
01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:15.397
over there.
We're gonna actually order


1424
01:06:15.528 --> 01:06:19.532
- some appetizers, right, baby?
- Thank God. I am famished.
Mademoiselle!


1425
01:06:19.619 --> 01:06:21.708
Right away. I'm not a figment
of your imagination.


1426
01:06:22.143 --> 01:06:24.493
Uh, 36 oysters.

1427
01:06:25.103 --> 01:06:27.583
Don't fob us off with any
of that Nova Scotia bullshit.


1428
01:06:27.714 --> 01:06:29.498
- I want Prince Edward Island.
- Malpeques, babe.


1429
01:06:30.151 --> 01:06:32.414
We can do separate checks,
not everyone together.


1430
01:06:32.545 --> 01:06:33.763
- He's joking, right?
- Yeah.


1431
01:06:34.155 --> 01:06:35.983
Of course he's fucking joking.
You are joking?


1432
01:06:36.114 --> 01:06:37.376
Yeah, I'm joking.

1433
01:06:37.593 --> 01:06:39.465
- Hilarious. Cheers!
- To jokes!


1434
01:06:39.856 --> 01:06:40.857
To jokes.

1435
01:06:41.032 --> 01:06:42.685
Ah, so funny!

1436
01:06:43.034 --> 01:06:45.123
So, we hadn't caught
anything in hours,


1437
01:06:45.297 --> 01:06:48.300
when Ruby suddenly notices
something bobbing in the water.


1438
01:06:48.604 --> 01:06:52.565
It was a dolphin that was caught
in some old fishing net.


1439
01:06:52.652 --> 01:06:54.262
The poor thing had been
struggling for days,


1440
01:06:54.393 --> 01:06:55.394
if not weeks.

1441
01:06:55.568 --> 01:06:57.787
Have you ever seen
an emaciated dolphin?


1442
01:06:58.658 --> 01:07:00.051
- No.
- It's awful.


1443
01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:02.183
Like models in the '90s.

1444
01:07:02.531 --> 01:07:05.143
I mean, attractive, obviously,
but deeply unhealthy.


1445
01:07:06.448 --> 01:07:09.103
Anyway, um,
without batting an eye,


1446
01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:10.670
Aqua Girl over here... 
RUBY: Oh, stop it.

1447
01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.585
No, but keep going.
It's a great story.


1448
01:07:12.976 --> 01:07:15.414
...dove into
the frigid Atlantic,


1449
01:07:15.631 --> 01:07:18.286
cutting free
the majestic cetacean.


1450
01:07:18.417 --> 01:07:19.853
- It was the right thing to do.
- Yeah.


1451
01:07:19.983 --> 01:07:21.333
Fuck me, it was incredible.

1452
01:07:21.507 --> 01:07:23.465
It swam alongside
the boat for hours,


1453
01:07:23.857 --> 01:07:26.425
just grateful to be alive
'cause of this goddess.


1454
01:07:26.816 --> 01:07:28.079
Well, I think
it had more to do


1455
01:07:28.209 --> 01:07:29.602
with the mackerel
we were feeding it.


1456
01:07:29.776 --> 01:07:32.692
Or because the DJ on board
was absolutely crushing it.


1457
01:07:32.822 --> 01:07:35.608
Oh, they really were.
They were really good, yeah.


1458
01:07:35.695 --> 01:07:37.044
Anyway, enough
of Ruby's heroics.


1459
01:07:37.175 --> 01:07:38.567
Gordon, I'm being so rude.

1460
01:07:38.698 --> 01:07:40.221
I haven't asked
what it is you do.


1461
01:07:41.483 --> 01:07:44.530
- Oh, um, I'm an academic.
- Oh, a professor!


1462
01:07:45.052 --> 01:07:47.707
Pray tell us, which university's
hallowed halls


1463
01:07:47.837 --> 01:07:49.230
do you grace with your insights?

1464
01:07:49.404 --> 01:07:50.927
- I teach eight grade English.
-Yeah.


1465
01:07:51.145 --> 01:07:53.669
Teacher of the year,
two years in a row.


1466
01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:54.844
Hey, that's not nothing.

1467
01:07:55.323 --> 01:07:57.847
Man, I was a terrible student.
Kicked out of high school.


1468
01:07:58.021 --> 01:07:59.675
But I think we can all agree

1469
01:07:59.762 --> 01:08:01.938
that traditional schooling
is a bit antiquated.


1470
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:03.636
Oh, yeah... Oh, 
Sophie didn't tell me

1471
01:08:03.723 --> 01:08:05.594
you were also an expert
in education reform.


1472
01:08:05.725 --> 01:08:08.467
Come on, Gordon.

1473
01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:10.425
I'm not trying
to shit on your job.


1474
01:08:10.556 --> 01:08:12.819
I'm just saying
that there are other ways


1475
01:08:12.906 --> 01:08:15.691
to forge a path to success.
Exhibit A.


1476
01:08:15.822 --> 01:08:17.215
And what an exhibit it is!

1477
01:08:17.345 --> 01:08:19.608
Excuse me, I'm gonna go
forge a path to the urinal.


1478
01:08:21.436 --> 01:08:22.568
Okay.

1479
01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:24.091
Is he mad at us?

1480
01:08:31.968 --> 01:08:34.014
Oh, fucking asparagus!

1481
01:08:34.971 --> 01:08:36.538
It must have been in the potage.

1482
01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:39.411
- What's potage?
- Soup.


1483
01:08:40.629 --> 01:08:41.935
Come on, mate.

1484
01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:43.850
Well, it looks like
I'm missing my flight.


1485
01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:45.721
Yeah, so much
for that quick drink, huh?


1486
01:08:47.506 --> 01:08:49.116
Free word of advice, friend.

1487
01:08:49.464 --> 01:08:52.163
I don't know you very well,
but Ruby, I do know.


1488
01:08:52.293 --> 01:08:53.642
And let me tell you,

1489
01:08:53.773 --> 01:08:56.254
when a woman like that
sets her sights on something,


1490
01:08:56.384 --> 01:08:58.778
she always gets what she wants.

1491
01:08:59.518 --> 01:09:01.433
What is that supposed to mean?
Did she say something to you?


1492
01:09:01.563 --> 01:09:03.783
A woman like that doesn't
need to say much, does she?


1493
01:09:04.436 --> 01:09:08.048
- That's even more cryptic.
- Is it? Is it?


1494
01:09:13.619 --> 01:09:14.663
He's right.

1495
01:09:15.055 --> 01:09:16.317
You gotta do it tonight.

1496
01:09:18.711 --> 01:09:19.886
You don't need a ring.

1497
01:09:21.017 --> 01:09:22.193
You don't need
her father's blessing.


1498
01:09:22.323 --> 01:09:23.846
You just need
the balls to do it.


1499
01:09:26.458 --> 01:09:27.894
Carpe fucking diem. Let's go.

1500
01:09:29.722 --> 01:09:31.506
Sophie, there's something
I want to ask you.


1501
01:09:32.551 --> 01:09:33.595
What's wrong? What happened?

1502
01:09:34.727 --> 01:09:38.557
It's Mammie.  She's dead.

1503
01:09:39.253 --> 01:09:41.081
No!

1504
01:09:41.212 --> 01:09:43.518
- Oh, my God!
-Oh...


1505
01:09:44.954 --> 01:09:45.912
Are we sure?

1506
01:09:52.875 --> 01:09:54.660
They're picking up
her body in an hour.


1507
01:09:55.313 --> 01:09:57.619
They're coming
to get her already?


1508
01:09:57.793 --> 01:09:59.012
I thought
we had more time.


1509
01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:02.885
But we don't.

1510
01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:08.761
Uh, babe, you look chilly.

1511
01:10:08.891 --> 01:10:10.284
Let me just
grab you a sweater, okay?


1512
01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:12.330
- Yeah. Thanks, babe.
-Okay. I love you.


1513
01:10:17.291 --> 01:10:18.945
At least you got
to see her before she died.


1514
01:10:19.032 --> 01:10:20.120
<i>Oui.</i>

1515
01:10:32.959 --> 01:10:34.090
This is crazy.

1516
01:10:36.397 --> 01:10:37.398
Gotta get the ring.

1517
01:10:37.485 --> 01:10:38.921
It's for Sophie, Mammie.
I'm so sorry.


1518
01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:42.185
Work with me, okay, on this?

1519
01:10:51.369 --> 01:10:54.241
Oh! Your lips are so cold.

1520
01:10:56.722 --> 01:10:57.766
Yes!

1521
01:11:15.567 --> 01:11:17.482
Oh!

1522
01:11:23.139 --> 01:11:24.184
Hey.

1523
01:11:24.619 --> 01:11:26.491
- What's going on?
-I'm just paying
my respects.


1524
01:11:27.143 --> 01:11:29.798
She's been so kind to me
ever since I got here, so...


1525
01:11:29.929 --> 01:11:31.278
Mm-hmm.

1526
01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.546
She looks so peaceful, you know?

1527
01:11:38.807 --> 01:11:41.506
Yeah, that's how she's been
since I've been here, just...


1528
01:11:41.810 --> 01:11:43.116
just resting in peace.

1529
01:11:45.074 --> 01:11:46.380
It's hard to lose a mother.

1530
01:11:48.034 --> 01:11:49.122
I do know that.

1531
01:11:55.215 --> 01:11:57.739
[IN FRENCH] And we shall
always remember Eleanore


1532
01:11:57.913 --> 01:11:59.741
for her enduring faith.

1533
01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:03.789
In the name
of the Father, the Son


1534
01:12:03.876 --> 01:12:05.268
and the Holy Ghost, amen.

1535
01:12:05.399 --> 01:12:06.531
Amen.

1536
01:12:06.618 --> 01:12:09.360
Would anyone like
to say a few words?


1537
01:12:09.751 --> 01:12:11.536
Oh, I'd like to
share something, Father.


1538
01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:17.368
Um, I am a woman of few words.

1539
01:12:17.498 --> 01:12:18.630
Then just shut up.

1540
01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.327
It's a little something
I wrote last night,


1541
01:12:20.414 --> 01:12:22.547
so just bear with me.

1542
01:12:34.689 --> 01:12:37.344
<i>♪ Whoa, yeah</i>

1543
01:12:37.866 --> 01:12:38.954
Imagine strings.

1544
01:12:39.781 --> 01:12:42.828
Beautiful. <i>♪ She's standing at the gate</i>

1545
01:12:43.394 --> 01:12:46.309
<i>♪ Saint Peter by her side... ♪</i>

1546
01:12:47.049 --> 01:12:49.182
What's happening?
- She's singing.


1547
01:12:49.443 --> 01:12:51.010
I know. I'm just...
It's so beautiful.


1548
01:12:51.793 --> 01:12:52.925
Right.

1549
01:12:53.055 --> 01:12:56.102
<i>♪ Looking down from the skies ♪</i>

1550

She's better than Céline.

1555
01:13:16.557 --> 01:13:17.863
Thank you for the song.

1556
01:13:17.950 --> 01:13:19.168
It was really gorgeous.

1557
01:13:19.517 --> 01:13:20.431
Beautiful.

1558
01:13:20.518 --> 01:13:22.433
Yeah, anytime.
I'm here for you.


1559
01:13:23.129 --> 01:13:24.391
Bring it in.

1560
01:13:27.307 --> 01:13:30.832
Yeah. I've been selling weed,
like, since I was a little kid.


1561
01:13:30.963 --> 01:13:33.705
- Oh, congrats.
- They called me
the Cowboy du Cannabis.


1562
01:13:33.835 --> 01:13:36.011
We had T-shirts
and everything. It was sick.


1563
01:13:36.708 --> 01:13:38.623
But then
the government made it legal,


1564
01:13:38.884 --> 01:13:39.972
which sucked huge.

1565
01:13:40.538 --> 01:13:41.713
Fucking Canada.

1566
01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:46.674
You know heaven?
What are the rules?


1567
01:13:47.806 --> 01:13:49.460
Because, between you and me,

1568
01:13:49.982 --> 01:13:51.940
I've done
some pretty bad things.


1569
01:13:54.682 --> 01:13:57.511
But if I become a cop,
I can help people. Huh?


1570
01:13:59.774 --> 01:14:00.862
Here.

1571
01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:03.952
- Her recipe book.
-<i>Oui.</i>


1572
01:14:09.175 --> 01:14:11.046
It'll bring you luck.

1573
01:14:12.352 --> 01:14:13.919
What about me?
What do I get?


1574
01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:17.705
You?
You got her breasts.


1575
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:19.925
Last thing.

1576
01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:22.928
A threesome.

1577
01:14:24.016 --> 01:14:25.800
Is it okay,
if everyone's Catholic?


1578
01:14:27.976 --> 01:14:29.456
I'm still
- in agriculture.
- Good.


1579
01:14:29.543 --> 01:14:30.631
Don't you worry.

1580
01:14:30.762 --> 01:14:32.459
I have a small grow-op
of coniferous trees.


1581
01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:33.591
Oh, cool!

1582
01:14:33.765 --> 01:14:35.462
Christmas is huge in Quebec.

1583
01:14:35.593 --> 01:14:36.942
Yeah,
Christmas is pretty big


1584
01:14:37.029 --> 01:14:38.421
in New York City as well.

1585
01:14:38.552 --> 01:14:39.771
Oh yeah? You want a tree?

1586
01:14:39.901 --> 01:14:41.512
No, thank you. It's July.

1587
01:14:41.642 --> 01:14:43.644
Exactly.
Give you a good price!


1588
01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:53.175
Quite a performance.

1589
01:14:53.524 --> 01:14:54.960
Oh, it was a straight
from the heart.


1590
01:14:55.613 --> 01:14:56.614
It wasn't even rehearsed.

1591
01:14:56.744 --> 01:14:57.876
Yeah, I could tell.

1592
01:14:58.659 --> 01:15:01.488
Uh, listen, I don't want
to overstep any boundaries,


1593
01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:04.883
but I do think
it's probably a good idea


1594
01:15:04.970 --> 01:15:06.493
to go ahead
and cancel the shoot.


1595
01:15:08.016 --> 01:15:09.714
I think it would
give those of us


1596
01:15:09.801 --> 01:15:11.193
who are actually in the family

1597
01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.676
a little... a little space
to grieve, you know,


1598
01:15:15.937 --> 01:15:20.463
in private, without the circus
of a reality television show.


1599
01:15:20.812 --> 01:15:22.509
Nah. The show must go on.

1600
01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:24.990
That's not really a thing.

1601
01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:27.427
That's a saying
they use in show business.


1602
01:15:27.558 --> 01:15:28.994
It's, uh, not something

1603
01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:31.953
that applies
to real-world tragedy.


1604
01:15:32.867 --> 01:15:34.173
We're in the middle of a...

1605
01:15:35.435 --> 01:15:37.785
Alphie, you poor man.

1606
01:15:38.612 --> 01:15:39.613
I'm sorry to interrupt.

1607
01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:40.701
Oh, no.

1608
01:15:40.919 --> 01:15:44.226
Um, but I've been giving it
a lot of thought,


1609
01:15:44.575 --> 01:15:46.577
and maybe we should reschedule.

1610
01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:49.841
We'll give your family
the appropriate amount of time


1611
01:15:49.928 --> 01:15:53.540
to grieve without the circus
of reality television.


1612
01:15:55.411 --> 01:15:57.065
That is so considerate of you.

1613
01:15:57.544 --> 01:15:59.502
Yeah, sounds a bit like
what I just said


1614
01:15:59.590 --> 01:16:00.678
two seconds ago in the kitchen.

1615
01:16:00.765 --> 01:16:02.723
Ruby's right, Dad.
We should reschedule.


1616
01:16:02.854 --> 01:16:05.030
Yeah, Ruby said it,
but I... I said it to Ruby,


1617
01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.161
and now you know it,

1618
01:16:06.553 --> 01:16:08.294
and now she sort of
disseminated it to the group.


1619
01:16:08.424 --> 01:16:09.904
And now I think
we're all on the same page


1620
01:16:09.991 --> 01:16:12.646
that the appropriate thing
is to have some time to grieve.


1621
01:16:14.213 --> 01:16:15.344
No.

1622
01:16:16.911 --> 01:16:19.000
No. The farm,
the land, it was her life.


1623
01:16:19.087 --> 01:16:20.959
She'd want us to do it.

1624
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:23.135
The show must go on.

1625
01:16:23.265 --> 01:16:24.440
It really must!

1626
01:16:28.227 --> 01:16:30.055
- Hi, Gordie.
- Mm.


1627
01:16:31.665 --> 01:16:33.406
Don't sweat it, Gordie.

1628
01:16:36.496 --> 01:16:39.412
Flow like, uh,
water. <i>Comme</i> Bruce Lee.


1629
01:16:42.023 --> 01:16:43.982
I liked
your Tonya Harding idea better.


1630
01:16:45.461 --> 01:16:47.812
We're gonna do things
a little differently today,


1631
01:16:47.942 --> 01:16:50.771
seeing as that our host's pantry
is an entire farm.


1632
01:16:51.076 --> 01:16:52.555
And not just any plot of land,

1633
01:16:52.686 --> 01:16:54.993
but the greatest supplier
of organic meats


1634
01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:56.385
on this side of the world.

1635
01:16:56.734 --> 01:16:59.998
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the Tremblay family!


1636
01:17:00.128 --> 01:17:02.522
Say <i>"bonjour,"</i>
you French Canadian phenoms.


1637
01:17:02.696 --> 01:17:04.306
<i>Bonjour!</i>[IN FRENCH] Hi, everyone!

1638
01:17:04.785 --> 01:17:06.482
We're gonna start things off
with a duck hunt


1639
01:17:06.613 --> 01:17:07.832
with this gorgeous fam,

1640
01:17:08.006 --> 01:17:09.572
followed by a confit
I will prepare


1641
01:17:09.703 --> 01:17:11.139
with the daughter
of these lands,


1642
01:17:11.226 --> 01:17:13.533
chef extraordinaire,
Sophie Tremblay.


1643
01:17:14.186 --> 01:17:15.274
That's my girlfriend.

1644
01:17:15.970 --> 01:17:18.016
-What do you say, Sophie?
- I say
let's get out of the pantry


1645
01:17:18.146 --> 01:17:20.583
and shoot some birds.
Bang, bang!


1646
01:17:24.326 --> 01:17:25.588
Pow, pow, pow!

1647
01:17:26.198 --> 01:17:27.242
Oh, boy!

1648
01:17:27.373 --> 01:17:28.679
Oh, no!

1649
01:17:28.809 --> 01:17:29.854
Good day for it, huh?

1650
01:17:33.161 --> 01:17:35.642
- Hey, hey, hey!
-[IN FRENCH] Why did you
dress up as a traffic cone, bro?


1651
01:17:35.816 --> 01:17:38.166
What, um...
- What are you wearing?
- What? Is the hat too much?


1652
01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:39.341
No, no, you just...

1653
01:17:39.515 --> 01:17:41.169
look like you're gonna repair
a cell tower.


1654
01:17:41.517 --> 01:17:45.478
Oh. I spoke to Mr. Bouchard
at the hunting shop,


1655
01:17:45.565 --> 01:17:47.045
and I just said, "Give me
the best money can buy."


1656
01:17:47.219 --> 01:17:49.003
He hooked me up with all this.
You know,


1657
01:17:49.090 --> 01:17:50.657
it's fully reflective,
head to toe.


1658
01:17:50.744 --> 01:17:51.963
Head to toe, I can see that.

1659
01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:53.747
Bouchard sold you that? <i>Oui.</i>

1660
01:17:57.229 --> 01:18:00.493
Okay, I'm sensing
I may have been upsold a bit.


1661
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:02.713
But you know what?
Don't laugh at me,


1662
01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.715
because I come
from British stock.


1663
01:18:05.498 --> 01:18:07.892
Hunting is in my blood. Oh, yeah?

1664
01:18:07.979 --> 01:18:08.980
'Cause I remember you crying

1665
01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:11.504
when that pigeon flew into
our living-room window and died.


1666
01:18:11.983 --> 01:18:14.289
Yeah, 'cause we couldn't
eat it. A wasted death.


1667
01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:16.248
Or am I misreading this,

1668
01:18:16.378 --> 01:18:17.945
and Ruby said
this was for the family


1669
01:18:18.076 --> 01:18:20.339
and you don't want me
to be included, right?


1670
01:18:20.426 --> 01:18:24.169
What? Babe, no. No, no, no.
You're always included.


1671
01:18:24.256 --> 01:18:25.953
- You know that, right?
- Okay. Good.
I want to be part of things.


1672
01:18:26.084 --> 01:18:27.128
I wanna-
-SOPHIE: Yeah. Yeah.

1673
01:18:27.607 --> 01:18:29.304
- I want to hunt.
- You're part of all of it.
Come here.


1674
01:18:30.741 --> 01:18:33.439
Has anyone seen Gordon?
Anyone?


1675
01:18:33.874 --> 01:18:37.269
Ha, ha! Very funny.

1676
01:18:40.794 --> 01:18:42.840
Though duck hunting
may seem barbaric,


1677
01:18:42.970 --> 01:18:45.668
it's actually very important
for our ecosystems.


1678
01:18:47.496 --> 01:18:48.628
This is fun, hey, babe?

1679
01:18:48.759 --> 01:18:50.717
I'm just so excited
to assassinate


1680
01:18:50.848 --> 01:18:51.892
something majestic!

1681
01:19:02.468 --> 01:19:03.556
Yes!

1682
01:19:03.730 --> 01:19:06.124
- Two nothing Patrice!
- I shot it.


1683
01:19:06.211 --> 01:19:08.082
Fuck off.[IN FRENCH] Both of you,
shut up.


1684
01:19:10.041 --> 01:19:11.216
Shooting blanks, Gordo?

1685
01:19:11.477 --> 01:19:14.436
I had the, uh, the safety on.
But safety first!


1686
01:19:17.831 --> 01:19:18.963
I got a fish!

1687
01:19:19.093 --> 01:19:21.792
Yeah, great! See?
I knew you had it in you!


1688
01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:23.750
Oh! So supportive.

1689
01:19:26.492 --> 01:19:28.537
It's not a sport,
it's a massacre.


1690
01:19:28.929 --> 01:19:31.149
Thing just wants to fly.

1691
01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:01.005
I got one!

1692
01:20:02.658 --> 01:20:03.703
Shooting blanks...

1693
01:20:03.834 --> 01:20:06.358
He's huge! He's a biggun!

1694
01:20:10.928 --> 01:20:14.105
Oh no!

1695
01:20:14.366 --> 01:20:16.890
False alarm!
False alarm, guys.


1696
01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:19.675
- I didn't get anything.
- Stop being humble, Gordon.


1697
01:20:19.937 --> 01:20:21.199
You gotta celebrate your kill!

1698
01:20:21.677 --> 01:20:22.896
My kill wants privacy.

1699
01:20:24.158 --> 01:20:25.333
Oh, my God, Gordon,

1700
01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:26.857
that's not a duck,
that's a swan.


1701
01:20:26.987 --> 01:20:28.336
Oh, no, Coucou!

1702
01:20:28.554 --> 01:20:30.425
Hey, shit, dude!

1703
01:20:30.556 --> 01:20:31.731
I... I got blinded by the sun,

1704
01:20:31.862 --> 01:20:34.560
and I... I thought
it was a... a large duck.


1705
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.171
Also, in my defense,

1706
01:20:37.302 --> 01:20:39.957
I think I may have
gotten a bad kazoo,


1707
01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:41.610
'cause this definitely
calls swans.


1708
01:20:41.872 --> 01:20:43.786
I think it's time
to turn in your gun, Golden Eye.


1709
01:20:44.178 --> 01:20:45.440
Let's cut, guys. Okay?
Should we cut


1710
01:20:45.527 --> 01:20:46.702
for a second, please?

1711
01:20:46.964 --> 01:20:49.488
Our duck has
roasted in its fat


1712
01:20:49.618 --> 01:20:51.098
for about an hour and a half,

1713
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:54.406
and now, the meat should
literally fall off the bone.


1714
01:20:54.536 --> 01:20:58.149
Mm! Look at all those juices
caressing the thighs.


1715
01:20:58.236 --> 01:21:00.281
Nice and moist,
just the way I like it.


1716
01:21:00.412 --> 01:21:04.198
Perfect. Now I would like
to bring out Monsieur Tremblay!


1717
01:21:04.372 --> 01:21:06.244
Go, go, go! <i>Mais non!</i>

1718
01:21:07.810 --> 01:21:09.682
Come on over,
Alphie, you musky hunk!


1719
01:21:12.076 --> 01:21:13.425
I would like to announce

1720
01:21:13.773 --> 01:21:16.819
that Tremblay Farms
will be the sole lamb supplier


1721
01:21:16.994 --> 01:21:19.474
for my new restaurant, Ruby,
at the Château Frontenac,


1722
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:22.347
opening this summer
in gorgeous Quebec City.


1723
01:21:24.479 --> 01:21:25.872
For real?
- Yes.


1724
01:21:25.959 --> 01:21:27.221
For real?

1725
01:21:27.439 --> 01:21:29.963
That's crazy!
- You're telling me this on TV?


1726
01:21:30.529 --> 01:21:31.530
Well, thank you!

1727
01:21:31.834 --> 01:21:34.446
And a special shout out
to the original gangster,


1728
01:21:34.663 --> 01:21:37.144
the Tremblay matriarch,
Mammie Tremblay.


1729
01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:41.279
May you grace the farmlands
of heaven for all of eternity.


1730
01:21:43.324 --> 01:21:45.500
Cut! Best show ever!

1731
01:21:50.636 --> 01:21:55.162
Ruby! Ruby!
Ruby! Ruby! Ruby! Ruby!


1732
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:58.949
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby...

1733
01:21:59.079 --> 01:22:00.341
No, for real!

1734
01:22:00.559 --> 01:22:02.909
I was freaking out!
It did not show on camera?


1735
01:22:03.083 --> 01:22:05.956
I felt like I was on, like,
this buzz, like my lips were...


1736
01:22:06.173 --> 01:22:07.827
my lips were
sticking to my teeth.


1737
01:22:07.914 --> 01:22:09.307
I was sweating.
I couldn't... No.


1738
01:22:09.524 --> 01:22:11.874
No, shut up, honestly.
You were incredible.


1739
01:22:12.223 --> 01:22:14.616
I mean, you'll get phone calls
for your own show from this.


1740
01:22:14.877 --> 01:22:16.879
I'm telling you.
You're beautiful.


1741
01:22:17.706 --> 01:22:18.969
- Phone's gonna be ringing.
- Okay, madame.


1742
01:22:19.056 --> 01:22:20.666
She's right, sweetie.

1743
01:22:20.796 --> 01:22:22.189
You look fantastic on TV.

1744
01:22:22.276 --> 01:22:24.583
Oh, thanks, Dad.
I love you.


1745
01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:27.064
I've got a few notes
if you want to become
the next Rachael Ray.


1746
01:22:28.717 --> 01:22:30.284
I'm kidding. You were perfect.

1747
01:22:30.415 --> 01:22:31.764
She's one-of-a-kind.

1748
01:22:31.851 --> 01:22:33.287
You've got potential.

1749
01:22:33.418 --> 01:22:36.769
So, Ruby,
you're a Jag girl, huh?


1750
01:22:37.596 --> 01:22:38.858
I would have thought
you'd drive, like,


1751
01:22:39.511 --> 01:22:41.687
an electric car
to set a good example


1752
01:22:41.774 --> 01:22:43.602
for your legions of followers.

1753
01:22:44.037 --> 01:22:46.822
Well, not to throw my bestie,
Elon, under the Hyperloop,


1754
01:22:46.997 --> 01:22:49.129
but some experts say
that those batteries


1755
01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.565
are more toxic
to the environment


1756
01:22:50.652 --> 01:22:51.914
than CO2 emissions.

1757
01:22:52.002 --> 01:22:53.960
Well, I think your experts
are full of shit.


1758
01:22:54.178 --> 01:22:56.136
I think you're jealous
I drive a collectible.


1759
01:22:56.267 --> 01:22:57.833
Well, you can collect...

1760
01:22:59.661 --> 01:23:00.706
Keep working on that.

1761
01:23:00.923 --> 01:23:02.403
Everyone! Attention,
<i>s'il vous plaît!</i>


1762
01:23:02.621 --> 01:23:04.144
Ruby has a speech, everybody!

1763
01:23:04.275 --> 01:23:05.928
Gather 'round!
Maybe there'll be a song.


1764
01:23:07.887 --> 01:23:11.238
Well, Sophie, it has been
an epic two weeks.


1765
01:23:11.369 --> 01:23:12.370
Yeah.

1766
01:23:12.457 --> 01:23:14.111
And in that time,
I've seen you


1767
01:23:14.241 --> 01:23:17.418
explode out of your chrysalid
like a fiery monarch.


1768
01:23:19.290 --> 01:23:20.900
So I wanted to take
this opportunity,


1769
01:23:21.074 --> 01:23:23.337
in front of your entire family,

1770
01:23:24.556 --> 01:23:27.820
to offer you the executive chef
position at the Château.


1771
01:23:27.994 --> 01:23:29.561
You won the job!

1772
01:23:31.128 --> 01:23:33.173
My daughter is coming home!

1773
01:23:35.958 --> 01:23:37.960
Surprise!

1774
01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:41.312
Dad! Oh my God,
I'm coming home!


1775
01:23:41.573 --> 01:23:42.922
I want to make a speech, too.

1776
01:23:43.009 --> 01:23:44.402
I got a speech, too!

1777
01:23:50.495 --> 01:23:52.453
I got a...
I got a speech, too, everybody.


1778
01:23:53.019 --> 01:23:54.499
Uh, thank you
for your attention.


1779
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:57.893
All just really beautiful.
Babe, I love you so much.


1780
01:23:57.980 --> 01:23:59.199
And she's right,
you're incredible.


1781
01:23:59.504 --> 01:24:00.983
You're incredible,
and I love you.


1782
01:24:01.071 --> 01:24:02.246
And it's just to me, personally,

1783
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:04.683
it's a shame that you're gonna
be wasting your talents


1784
01:24:04.813 --> 01:24:06.946
on some poser chef's
vanity project.


1785
01:24:07.077 --> 01:24:08.382
Gordon... GORDON: No.

1786
01:24:08.817 --> 01:24:10.297
I mean, that was a power move,

1787
01:24:10.384 --> 01:24:13.779
swooping in and saving
the entire farm from bankruptcy.


1788
01:24:13.909 --> 01:24:16.303
I mean, hats off to you.

1789
01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:17.957
You gotta win over
the dad, right?


1790
01:24:18.523 --> 01:24:19.567
That's enough.

1791
01:24:19.698 --> 01:24:21.613
Yeah, I agree with Alphonse.
It's enough.


1792
01:24:21.743 --> 01:24:24.137
It's enough with the fucking
restaurant and the lip line


1793
01:24:24.268 --> 01:24:26.531
and the fucking all this.
I've had enough of it.


1794
01:24:26.922 --> 01:24:28.228
The girl who can't do wrong.

1795
01:24:28.446 --> 01:24:31.144
Whereas everyone thinks I'm
the guy who kills fucking swans


1796
01:24:31.275 --> 01:24:32.537
and punches fathers in the face.

1797
01:24:32.754 --> 01:24:34.495
At this point, you probably
all think I killed Mammie!


1798
01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:36.758
I didn't kill Mammie.
I didn't kill Mammie.


1799
01:24:36.845 --> 01:24:39.196
Gordie, let's go
chill in the chicken house.


1800
01:24:39.370 --> 01:24:41.111
I'm not going
to the chicken house!


1801
01:24:41.285 --> 01:24:42.721
You shouldn't be
living in a chicken house!


1802
01:24:43.809 --> 01:24:45.071
I bet you're really good in bed.

1803
01:24:45.202 --> 01:24:47.117
Is she good
in bed, baby?


1804
01:24:48.161 --> 01:24:49.380
Or do you need a refresher,

1805
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:51.121
because I'm sure
she'll give you one.


1806
01:24:51.425 --> 01:24:52.948
Someone should be
using the waterbed.


1807
01:24:53.079 --> 01:24:54.428
I said that's enough!

1808
01:24:54.994 --> 01:24:56.691
What are you doing?

1809
01:25:00.913 --> 01:25:02.044
Fuck!

1810
01:25:02.871 --> 01:25:04.090
Sophie, wait, wait, wait!

1811
01:25:04.221 --> 01:25:06.179
What the hell
is wrong with you?


1812
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:08.181
I'm sorry, I was tryna be funny.
Everyone was laughing.


1813
01:25:08.312 --> 01:25:10.183
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
-So I only got this job


1814
01:25:10.444 --> 01:25:11.967
because she wants
to sleep with me?


1815
01:25:12.098 --> 01:25:13.230
Is that what you think?

1816
01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:16.276
Forget about all the hard work
that I've put into this, right?


1817
01:25:17.408 --> 01:25:18.974
Well, admit there's
a chance I'm right.


1818
01:25:20.367 --> 01:25:21.760
Did you ever
want me to have this?


1819
01:25:21.847 --> 01:25:23.022
Do you want to have it?

1820
01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.242
Because we have
a pretty fucking great life,


1821
01:25:25.329 --> 01:25:27.244
where you're cooking food
that you love.


1822
01:25:27.374 --> 01:25:28.549
But I don't know, Sophie.

1823
01:25:28.767 --> 01:25:30.682
Maybe there aren't
enough cameras around.


1824
01:25:32.379 --> 01:25:33.511
Okay, I'm sorry.

1825
01:25:34.468 --> 01:25:37.297
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I have ambition.


1826
01:25:37.732 --> 01:25:39.343
I'm sorry
that she believes in me.


1827
01:25:39.473 --> 01:25:41.780
Believes in you?
She's in love with you!


1828
01:25:41.954 --> 01:25:43.260
Are you kidding me?
How do you not see that?


1829
01:25:43.390 --> 01:25:44.565
You definitely see that, right?

1830
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:47.351
And of course she is,
because you're fucking perfect!


1831
01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.267
But I think you need
to admit to yourself


1832
01:25:51.006 --> 01:25:52.965
that you're also
still in love with her.


1833
01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:56.577
She did break your heart, right?

1834
01:25:57.143 --> 01:25:59.928
Yeah. Yeah,
she broke my heart.


1835
01:26:00.799 --> 01:26:02.104
And then I left her.

1836
01:26:04.716 --> 01:26:05.891
And I found you.

1837
01:26:06.761 --> 01:26:08.241
And then,
she came crawling back...


1838
01:26:09.286 --> 01:26:10.722
and you thought,

1839
01:26:10.852 --> 01:26:13.333
"Maybe I could sleep my way
to a Michelin star."


1840
01:26:18.425 --> 01:26:19.818
I think you should go.

1841
01:26:22.951 --> 01:26:24.214
You heard her.

1842
01:26:30.089 --> 01:26:31.308
I did.

1843
01:27:08.519 --> 01:27:10.695
<i>And remember,
if you can't handle the heat,</i>


1844
01:27:10.782 --> 01:27:12.000
<i>throw on some oven mitts,</i>

1845
01:27:12.174 --> 01:27:14.089
<i>because everyone
belongs in the kitchen.</i>


1846
01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:15.526
<i>Till next time!</i>

1847
01:27:21.096 --> 01:27:22.097
Sophie...

1848
01:27:24.796 --> 01:27:26.101
Sophie, call him.

1849
01:27:26.232 --> 01:27:27.886
Not after what he did.

1850
01:27:28.626 --> 01:27:30.192
Make a scene at dinner?

1851
01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:32.673
If anything, that makes him
more a part of the family.


1852
01:27:32.804 --> 01:27:34.022
He humiliated me.

1853
01:27:34.980 --> 01:27:36.808
If you can't see
he did it out of love,


1854
01:27:36.982 --> 01:27:38.375
maybe he was right
to say those things.


1855
01:27:38.592 --> 01:27:39.854
He made it all about himself.

1856
01:27:43.205 --> 01:27:44.163
It's not about him.

1857
01:27:44.294 --> 01:27:45.860
It's about me
and getting the job.


1858
01:27:46.165 --> 01:27:47.688
Yeah. And you got it.

1859
01:27:50.169 --> 01:27:51.213
But at what cost?

1860
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:17.022
Hey!

1861
01:28:20.199 --> 01:28:22.201
Thank you so much, man.
I really appreciate it.


1862
01:28:22.288 --> 01:28:24.159
I couldn't show my face
after everything that happened.


1863
01:28:25.117 --> 01:28:26.161
Here you go.

1864
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:29.034
Yeah,
it was pretty fucked up.


1865
01:28:29.339 --> 01:28:30.688
So humiliating.

1866
01:28:31.950 --> 01:28:33.560
Anyway, how is she?

1867
01:28:34.169 --> 01:28:35.693
She was gone
before I woke up.


1868
01:28:35.867 --> 01:28:37.216
Right.
It's the big night, huh?


1869
01:28:37.347 --> 01:28:38.391
Forget about all that.
Are you ready?


1870
01:28:38.478 --> 01:28:39.566
Are you ready
to crush this test?


1871
01:28:39.914 --> 01:28:42.047
I'm so nervous,
I could piss my legs, you know.


1872
01:28:42.221 --> 01:28:44.571
"Piss my pants"
is the expression,


1873
01:28:44.702 --> 01:28:45.746
but I doubt
that's gonna come up.


1874
01:28:45.877 --> 01:28:47.095
Don't worry.

1875
01:28:48.314 --> 01:28:50.272
Thanks for believing in me,
Gordon.


1876
01:28:52.449 --> 01:28:54.015
You're a good guy.

1877
01:28:56.757 --> 01:29:00.587
Go make me proud, okay?
Kick ass. Do it for Van Damme.


1878
01:29:01.283 --> 01:29:02.372
Yeah.

1879
01:29:06.593 --> 01:29:07.942
Hey...

1880
01:29:08.726 --> 01:29:09.988
She still loves you.

1881
01:29:13.165 --> 01:29:14.688
Good luck!

1882
01:29:31.313 --> 01:29:33.185
Can we have someone else come
and bring these out?


1883
01:29:33.533 --> 01:29:35.230
Right away!

1884
01:29:35.883 --> 01:29:37.755
Voilà, chef. <i>Merci!</i>

1885
01:29:54.249 --> 01:29:55.163
Ah!

1886
01:29:55.468 --> 01:29:56.817
The most
beautiful family in town


1887
01:29:56.948 --> 01:29:58.297
doesn't wait in line!
Please go ahead.


1888
01:29:58.471 --> 01:29:59.907
<i>Merci! Merci beaucoup!</i>

1889
01:30:00.038 --> 01:30:01.648
VIP!

1890
01:30:02.257 --> 01:30:04.912
Hey, it's the weatherman
from Channel 3!


1891
01:30:05.173 --> 01:30:06.697
Let's just stay calm.

1892
01:30:08.568 --> 01:30:11.876
- Shit, it's Georges St-Pierre!
- Go talk to him!


1893
01:30:12.006 --> 01:30:13.530
Sorry.

1894
01:30:13.704 --> 01:30:17.142
Sorry, Georges. I just wanted
to say, you're my hero.


1895
01:30:17.316 --> 01:30:18.578
Uh, the first time I...

1896
01:30:20.798 --> 01:30:23.931
The first time I shaved my head
was because of you.


1897
01:30:24.062 --> 01:30:25.237
Ah, cool. <i>Oui.</i>

1898
01:30:25.367 --> 01:30:27.935
Actually, the first time
was 'cause I had lice,


1899
01:30:28.153 --> 01:30:29.981
but the second time
was 'cause of you.


1900
01:30:30.111 --> 01:30:31.765
I don't have lice anymore.

1901
01:30:35.726 --> 01:30:39.251
Your jiu-jitsu tattoo,
I want to get the same one.


1902
01:30:39.338 --> 01:30:41.035
I just need more cash.

1903
01:30:42.384 --> 01:30:44.691
That's interesting,
- huh, Marcellus?
- If you ever need


1904
01:30:44.822 --> 01:30:47.912
a grappling partner,
text me. 418-22--


1905
01:30:48.347 --> 01:30:50.610
I'll call you.

1906
01:30:50.741 --> 01:30:53.221
Relax! Don't touch
my fucking chain, dude.


1907
01:30:56.398 --> 01:30:58.749
- I think he's gonna call me.
- It seems that way.


1908
01:30:59.271 --> 01:31:01.534
Oh!

1909
01:31:06.713 --> 01:31:08.193
I'm flying out on the red eye.

1910
01:31:08.323 --> 01:31:09.455
So, that's it?

1911
01:31:09.977 --> 01:31:11.762
<i>What do you mean?
Have you not been listening?</i>


1912
01:31:11.892 --> 01:31:13.981
It's over. I lost.

1913
01:31:14.808 --> 01:31:16.636
Honey, I love you.

1914
01:31:17.507 --> 01:31:19.247
<i>But you've played it safe
way too long.</i>


1915
01:31:20.118 --> 01:31:22.120
<i>You've never left
this neighborhood. I mean,</i>


1916
01:31:22.555 --> 01:31:24.601
you teach at the high school
that you went to.


1917
01:31:24.688 --> 01:31:26.298
And that's
a little bit my fault.


1918
01:31:26.951 --> 01:31:28.082
<i>When your mother passed away,</i>

1919
01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:29.954
<i>I did everything I could
to protect you, and I...</i>


1920
01:31:32.130 --> 01:31:33.871
I think I turned you
into a bit of a pussy.


1921
01:31:34.349 --> 01:31:35.568
Are you trying to be helpful?

1922
01:31:35.699 --> 01:31:37.439
She's a fighter, Gordon!

1923
01:31:37.570 --> 01:31:38.571
It runs in her family.

1924
01:31:39.137 --> 01:31:41.922
So, fight back and show her
you're not down for the count.


1925
01:31:42.053 --> 01:31:43.489
That's what marriage is!

1926
01:31:44.359 --> 01:31:45.622
<i>If you get on that plane, son,</i>

1927
01:31:45.752 --> 01:31:46.927
<i>you'll be giving up
the greatest thing</i>


1928
01:31:47.058 --> 01:31:48.146
<i>that's ever happened to you.</i>

1929
01:31:48.363 --> 01:31:50.540
And as much as I'd love
to keep you close,


1930
01:31:51.236 --> 01:31:53.455
I'd rather have you living
happily in another country


1931
01:31:53.586 --> 01:31:55.327
<i>than be miserable in Brooklyn.</i>

1932
01:31:55.719 --> 01:31:57.024
Also, for Christ's sakes,

1933
01:31:57.111 --> 01:31:59.549
would you get me
a goddamn Canadian passport?


1934
01:31:59.679 --> 01:32:01.594
I can't just show up, Dad, okay?

1935
01:32:01.681 --> 01:32:03.422
This is the biggest night
of her life.


1936
01:32:03.509 --> 01:32:05.642
I'm the last person in the world
she wants to see.


1937
01:32:06.686 --> 01:32:07.774
I'm gonna make an ass of myself.

1938
01:32:07.861 --> 01:32:10.255
That's exactly
what you have to do!


1939
01:32:15.216 --> 01:32:16.391
Holy shit, you're right!

1940
01:32:36.803 --> 01:32:39.371
Wow![IN FRENCH] It looks like soap.

1941
01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.377
You idiot, it's a mousse!

1942
01:32:48.510 --> 01:32:50.730
The Tremblays, my loves!

1943
01:32:50.904 --> 01:32:52.384
Oh!

1944
01:32:52.819 --> 01:32:54.865
Pretty
effin delish, am I right?


1945
01:32:55.561 --> 01:32:59.130
Yeah, it's,
it's, it's...


1946
01:32:59.304 --> 01:33:00.218
Exactly.

1947
01:33:01.393 --> 01:33:03.003
Oh!
Don't forget to eat the plates.


1948
01:33:03.177 --> 01:33:05.571
They're made entirely
out of compressed crab.


1949
01:33:06.311 --> 01:33:10.271
Oh! So good!
Okay, <i>bon appétit!</i>


1950
01:33:10.358 --> 01:33:11.751
She wants us
to eat the plate?


1951
01:33:11.882 --> 01:33:13.971
Hey, uh,
have you spoken to Gordon?


1952
01:33:14.711 --> 01:33:16.190
No, I thought he talked to you.

1953
01:33:16.277 --> 01:33:17.365
No.

1954
01:33:18.323 --> 01:33:19.629
He's heartbroken. He left.

1955
01:33:27.071 --> 01:33:28.289
- How are you?
- Good.


1956
01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:30.204
Thanks so much, man. <i>C'est rien.</i>

1957
01:33:30.335 --> 01:33:31.510
Hey, hey!
I'm so sorry.


1958
01:33:31.641 --> 01:33:33.381
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh!

1959
01:33:33.512 --> 01:33:36.080
I've never done this in
my life before, I swear. I-I...


1960
01:33:36.254 --> 01:33:38.648
I need to, um... I don't know
how to say it <i>en français.</i>


1961
01:33:39.605 --> 01:33:41.041
Uh, I need to...

1962
01:33:41.651 --> 01:33:43.435
...cut the line for love.

1963
01:33:44.958 --> 01:33:46.351
Touching.

1964
01:33:46.438 --> 01:33:48.179
Are you
- on the list?
- I am on the list.


1965
01:33:48.266 --> 01:33:49.746
-Yeah?
- Well, I was on the list.


1966
01:33:49.833 --> 01:33:51.530
It's been a pretty crazy

1967
01:33:51.661 --> 01:33:53.184
and I don't know
if I'm still on the list.


1968
01:33:53.314 --> 01:33:56.100
It really depends on when
the list was created and edited.


1969
01:33:56.187 --> 01:33:58.232
So, if you look,
it's Gordon Kinski.


1970
01:33:58.624 --> 01:34:00.800
Kin... With a K?GORDON: Yeah.

1971
01:34:00.931 --> 01:34:02.846
Kinski. No, you're not.

1972
01:34:03.585 --> 01:34:05.979
But I hear Cirque du Soleil
is hiring right now.


1973
01:34:06.110 --> 01:34:08.242
Can I just talk to you
<i>mano a mano</i> for just one second?


1974
01:34:08.547 --> 01:34:09.983
This is one of those
times in life


1975
01:34:10.114 --> 01:34:12.072
where you can really step up
and do the right thing,


1976
01:34:12.159 --> 01:34:16.424
because my future, my happiness,
my true love is in there,


1977
01:34:17.077 --> 01:34:18.600
and I need your help
to make things right.


1978
01:34:18.731 --> 01:34:19.863
There's a fork in the road.

1979
01:34:20.167 --> 01:34:23.214
It's all in your tiny, beautiful
little manicured hands.


1980
01:34:24.476 --> 01:34:27.740
What do you say? Please,
I'm begging you, let me in.


1981
01:34:40.318 --> 01:34:42.102
Hey,
I'm just storming the castle.


1982
01:34:42.929 --> 01:34:43.974
How's your night going?

1983
01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:54.288
- Soph.
- Hey.


1984
01:34:54.419 --> 01:34:55.899
You know,
I just wanna say, I'm sorry


1985
01:34:55.986 --> 01:34:57.727
about everything
Gordon has put you through.


1986
01:34:58.292 --> 01:35:00.033
You're handling yourself
like a true pro.


1987
01:35:00.555 --> 01:35:04.124
Thanks. It's a little
overwhelming, but...


1988
01:35:04.559 --> 01:35:07.040
With great success
comes a ton of jealousy.


1989
01:35:07.606 --> 01:35:08.781
Believe me, I know.

1990
01:35:08.868 --> 01:35:10.783
But the sooner you cut
those toxic people


1991
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:13.003
out of your life,
the higher you can fly.


1992
01:35:19.574 --> 01:35:20.793
I'll be right back.

1993
01:35:22.447 --> 01:35:23.535
-Gordon.
- Alphonse.


1994
01:35:23.796 --> 01:35:24.971
You got
a lot of nerve coming here.


1995
01:35:25.145 --> 01:35:27.669
You're right. Last night
I was a complete asshole.


1996
01:35:27.757 --> 01:35:30.107
I'm so sorry.
I was totally drunk


1997
01:35:30.281 --> 01:35:32.674
and insecure.
I'm not making excuses.


1998
01:35:32.892 --> 01:35:36.635
I... I take full responsibility.
But I love your daughter,


1999
01:35:37.331 --> 01:35:38.811
and I'm not giving up
that easily.


2000
01:35:39.594 --> 01:35:41.335
I want to ask you
for her hand in marriage.


2001
01:35:42.162 --> 01:35:43.642
We're magic together.

2002
01:35:44.686 --> 01:35:46.776
And I don't just mean
in the kitchen.


2003
01:35:55.175 --> 01:35:56.307
What are you doing?

2004
01:35:56.873 --> 01:35:59.223
Why pretend?
We both want this.


2005
01:35:59.701 --> 01:36:01.138
Oh, my God!

2006
01:36:01.399 --> 01:36:03.662
You are the last person
I would ever want to be with.


2007
01:36:04.663 --> 01:36:05.838
Things change.

2008
01:36:07.448 --> 01:36:08.754
Sometimes, for the best.

2009
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:11.104
Don't you know how much
I've done for you?


2010
01:36:11.452 --> 01:36:13.106
You called me, okay?

2011
01:36:13.237 --> 01:36:15.456
So don't act like
you're some kind of savior here.


2012
01:36:15.587 --> 01:36:16.980
Okay, I'm sorry,

2013
01:36:17.067 --> 01:36:20.113
but who saved your shitty
family farm from bankruptcy?


2014
01:36:21.288 --> 01:36:22.812
She deserves to be happy.

2015
01:36:25.379 --> 01:36:26.728
Yeah.

2016
01:36:30.471 --> 01:36:32.169
I'm sorry I killed your swan.

2017
01:36:37.827 --> 01:36:39.741
I want you
to remember this moment.


2018
01:36:40.525 --> 01:36:42.092
When you could have
been something,


2019
01:36:42.179 --> 01:36:44.572
but you threw it all away
and went back to being nothing.


2020
01:36:45.399 --> 01:36:48.707
'Cause that's what you are
without me. You're nothing.


2021
01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:52.624
And I want you
to remember this moment...


2022
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:55.801
when I broke your
perfect little nose.


2023
01:36:58.586 --> 01:36:59.718
What the fuck?

2024
01:37:00.850 --> 01:37:04.636
Oh, not the face! Malcolm!

2025
01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:06.812
Hey, hey, hey!

2026
01:37:07.247 --> 01:37:08.727
Where are you going?

2027
01:37:08.901 --> 01:37:10.337
Dad, I don't know.

2028
01:37:11.077 --> 01:37:13.645
I have to call Gordon.

2029
01:37:13.819 --> 01:37:16.039
Hey, listen. It's okay.

2030
01:37:16.735 --> 01:37:17.649
He was here.

2031
01:37:17.823 --> 01:37:18.693
Huh? <i>Oui.</i>

2032
01:37:18.824 --> 01:37:20.608
Yes. It wasn't easy, but...

2033
01:37:21.609 --> 01:37:23.133
he saw you and Ruby kissing.

2034
01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:26.571
Kissing? I just punched her
in the face!


2035
01:37:27.528 --> 01:37:30.314
What?[IN ENGLISH] Guys...

2036
01:37:30.618 --> 01:37:32.142
I just checked online.

2037
01:37:32.272 --> 01:37:34.753
I passed! I'm gonna be a cop!

2038
01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:36.450
Dad, please.

2039
01:37:36.537 --> 01:37:37.712
Where's Gordon?

2040
01:37:38.713 --> 01:37:39.889
Did I miss something?

2041
01:37:54.425 --> 01:37:55.774
You want me out of here, Ruby?

2042
01:37:55.948 --> 01:37:57.341
I'm out of here.

2043
01:37:58.690 --> 01:38:00.735
As soon as I figure out
how to drive manual.


2044
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:03.173
Where are you going?

2045
01:38:06.002 --> 01:38:06.959
Ow!

2046
01:38:07.351 --> 01:38:08.830
Okay, here we go.
Here we go!


2047
01:38:09.875 --> 01:38:11.485
-Hey!
-Sorry!


2048
01:38:13.705 --> 01:38:15.098
Naughty boy.

2049
01:38:15.315 --> 01:38:17.187
[IN ENGLISH] Come on!

2050
01:38:17.317 --> 01:38:18.710
Is he outside?

2051
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:20.233
He can't be far.

2052
01:38:21.495 --> 01:38:22.670
Hey, have you seen Gordon?

2053
01:38:22.888 --> 01:38:25.499
He just stole
Ruby's car. Very slowly.


2054
01:38:25.630 --> 01:38:27.632
Gordon!

2055
01:38:27.719 --> 01:38:29.242
Gordon, stop!

2056
01:38:32.550 --> 01:38:33.507
Yes, backup!

2057
01:38:35.248 --> 01:38:36.815
Hey, <i>allô!</i>

2058
01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:40.036
Constable Junior Tremblay.
Police. I need your car.


2059
01:38:40.427 --> 01:38:42.081
Where's your badge?

2060
01:38:42.255 --> 01:38:43.517
Uh, I just graduated today.

2061
01:38:43.778 --> 01:38:47.478
And I just got
promoted to Captain, fuck off.


2062
01:38:47.608 --> 01:38:50.350
Hey, hey. A little respect.

2063
01:38:50.916 --> 01:38:53.136
He worked hard.
And I'm proud of him.


2064
01:38:53.658 --> 01:38:54.615
Thanks, Dad.

2065
01:38:55.007 --> 01:38:57.749
Can we talk about this later?
Officer, please.


2066
01:38:58.315 --> 01:38:59.664
He's the love of my life.

2067
01:39:00.578 --> 01:39:02.188
Okay. Get in.[IN ENGLISH] Yes!

2068
01:39:03.929 --> 01:39:06.149
Ease it out.
Ease it out. Come on!


2069
01:39:07.237 --> 01:39:08.934
In second gear.

2070
01:39:09.587 --> 01:39:12.764
You know what, I do need to...
Clutch down.


2071
01:39:12.894 --> 01:39:15.593
Where are you, two? Is that it?

2072
01:39:15.723 --> 01:39:18.074
We should track
his phone like Jason Bourne.


2073
01:39:19.814 --> 01:39:20.859
Where are you, Gordon?

2074
01:39:20.990 --> 01:39:22.904
Oh! <i>Merci.</i>

2075
01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:25.037
Excuse me.

2076
01:39:25.211 --> 01:39:28.693
Have you seen...
any member of my family?


2077
01:39:28.780 --> 01:39:30.303
Why does it smell
like cigarettes?


2078
01:39:30.956 --> 01:39:32.044
It's true it does smell.

2079
01:39:32.523 --> 01:39:34.525
As soon as I got in the car,
I was so grossed out. Yuck.


2080
01:39:38.094 --> 01:39:40.792
It's him! There he is!

2081
01:39:41.053 --> 01:39:44.230
No, no, no!
I'm just borrowing it, sir!


2082
01:39:45.884 --> 01:39:48.104
Oh, shit!

2083
01:39:49.018 --> 01:39:50.671
He's out of his mind!

2084
01:39:50.758 --> 01:39:52.108
<i>Tokyo Drift,</i> Gordie!

2085
01:39:52.325 --> 01:39:55.067
Yes! I am the best
at car chases!


2086
01:39:56.242 --> 01:39:57.548
Can you go around, please?

2087
01:39:58.853 --> 01:39:59.985
A lot of grinding...

2088
01:40:03.467 --> 01:40:05.034
Clutch down.

2089
01:40:06.557 --> 01:40:07.949
Yeah, second gear, yes!

2090
01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.082
Yes! Yes!

2091
01:40:10.996 --> 01:40:13.999
Yes! No, no, no!

2092
01:40:14.391 --> 01:40:17.698
Shit!

2093
01:40:18.221 --> 01:40:19.352
He's gonna crash
into the--


2094
01:40:33.540 --> 01:40:35.020
You're awake.

2095
01:40:37.370 --> 01:40:38.676
Hey!

2096
01:40:39.372 --> 01:40:40.852
Hey, sweetie!

2097
01:40:40.939 --> 01:40:43.333
I had the most
horrible dream, babe.


2098
01:40:43.768 --> 01:40:45.552
I saw you kiss Ruby...

2099
01:40:47.163 --> 01:40:49.904
and then I drove her car
into a building.


2100
01:40:50.862 --> 01:40:51.993
That all happened.

2101
01:40:53.299 --> 01:40:55.214
But she kissed me,
and I punched her in the face.


2102
01:40:55.562 --> 01:40:57.216
- Really?
- Yeah.


2103
01:40:57.869 --> 01:41:00.001
Oh! That makes me so happy.

2104
01:41:02.091 --> 01:41:03.179
What about your job?

2105
01:41:03.614 --> 01:41:04.615
I quit.

2106
01:41:05.137 --> 01:41:06.443
- Really?
-Yeah.


2107
01:41:07.313 --> 01:41:09.663
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.


2108
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:15.147
There's something
I wanted to ask you.


2109
01:41:22.067 --> 01:41:23.373
Will you marry me?

2110
01:41:23.851 --> 01:41:26.811
- Where did you get that?
- When the nurses
cut your pantaloons off,


2111
01:41:26.898 --> 01:41:28.291
they found it in your pocket.

2112
01:41:28.552 --> 01:41:30.249
They destroyed my pantaloons?

2113
01:41:31.032 --> 01:41:32.295
They did.

2114
01:41:32.425 --> 01:41:33.818
They were rented.

2115
01:41:34.949 --> 01:41:37.604
But, babe, I wanted to ask
your father's permission first.


2116
01:41:37.735 --> 01:41:38.692
It's important to me.

2117
01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:42.870
Alphonse?

2118
01:41:43.741 --> 01:41:45.003
You have my blessing.

2119
01:41:46.135 --> 01:41:47.440
Welcome to the family, Gordie!

2120
01:41:47.875 --> 01:41:49.616
Wait, he hasn't said yes yet.

2121
01:41:52.097 --> 01:41:53.142
So?

2122
01:41:53.751 --> 01:41:56.101
Yes.
I love you so much.


2123
01:41:56.188 --> 01:41:58.625
Yes, yes, yes.

2124
01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:01.846
- Give me your beautiful finger.
-Oh, my God!


2125
01:42:04.022 --> 01:42:05.371
I love you so much!

2126
01:42:05.545 --> 01:42:07.852
Ah, baby,
my ribs are... Careful, okay.


2127
01:42:07.982 --> 01:42:09.158
Ah! Ow!

2128
01:42:09.288 --> 01:42:11.247
Oh, babe! Ow! Ow!

2129
01:42:17.078 --> 01:42:19.080
As Cassius famously
said to Brutus:


2130
01:42:19.211 --> 01:42:21.692
"It is not in the stars
to hold our destiny...


2131
01:42:22.693 --> 01:42:24.042
but in ourselves."

2132
01:42:25.174 --> 01:42:26.262
That's not gonna be on the test.

2133
01:42:26.436 --> 01:42:27.524
It's just a quote
I really like.


2134
01:42:28.829 --> 01:42:30.744
Remember, oral exams
are Tuesday.


2135
01:42:30.875 --> 01:42:32.572
- One minute each!
-Don't worry.


2136
01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:34.705
When I oral,
it's always at least one minute.


2137
01:42:34.879 --> 01:42:37.098
Double-entendre
from Robert, everybody.


2138
01:42:37.882 --> 01:42:39.144
Have a good weekend!

2139
01:42:47.674 --> 01:42:50.460
MAMMIE'S KITCHEN

2140
01:42:51.635 --> 01:42:53.114
- Alphonse!
- Hey, Gordie!


2141
01:42:53.202 --> 01:42:55.421
- Do you need a hand?
- No, I'm good.


2142
01:42:55.639 --> 01:42:56.727
Everyone is inside.

2143
01:43:00.948 --> 01:43:02.254

01:43:06.127 --> 01:43:08.042
Hello, my baby.
Hello!


2147
01:43:08.173 --> 01:43:10.262
- How are you guys doing?
- I'm so hungry.


2148
01:43:10.654 --> 01:43:12.046
So,
can you grab these?


2149
01:43:12.133 --> 01:43:13.613
With pleasure. <i>Merci.</i>

2150
01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:16.616
Hey, everybody!

2151
01:43:18.662 --> 01:43:19.880
It looks delicious!

2152
01:43:19.967 --> 01:43:21.230
Amazing!
- Oh!


2153
01:43:21.665 --> 01:43:23.928
You're good.
- Oh, thank you.


2154
01:43:24.363 --> 01:43:25.712
So, Junior,

2155
01:43:25.843 --> 01:43:27.975
- you're a cop, huh?
- Yes, sir!


2156
01:43:28.237 --> 01:43:29.499
You ever shot anyone?

2157
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:31.065
Uh, no.

2158
01:43:31.196 --> 01:43:33.590
But my girlfriend and I,
we tased a bike thief yesterday.


2159
01:43:33.894 --> 01:43:35.635
"We?" No, I tased him.

2160
01:43:35.722 --> 01:43:37.550
Yeah, but I'm the one
who saw him.


2161
01:43:37.637 --> 01:43:39.073
I'm the one
who saw him first.


2162
01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:41.162
- I could have tased him.
- I don't give a rat's ass,


2163
01:43:41.293 --> 01:43:43.774
as long as someone was tased
and justice was served.


2164
01:43:43.948 --> 01:43:45.123
Dad, can you watch
your language?


2165
01:43:45.210 --> 01:43:46.603
- There's a toddler here.
- Oh, sorry.


2166
01:43:46.864 --> 01:43:48.822
Don't worry,
I've said much worse.


2167
01:43:48.909 --> 01:43:50.041
Oh, by the way,
Peter,


2168
01:43:50.171 --> 01:43:52.696
I loved your <i>Widow's Hammock.</i>

2169
01:43:53.218 --> 01:43:54.872
My goodness! Thank you, Ginette.

2170
01:43:55.481 --> 01:43:58.179
- I hope I'm not overstepping.
- But he will, watch.


2171
01:43:58.658 --> 01:44:00.660
But would you consider
being the cover model


2172
01:44:00.747 --> 01:44:01.835
for my next book?

2173
01:44:02.183 --> 01:44:03.402
Did you hear, Alphonse?

2174
01:44:03.489 --> 01:44:04.882
He asked me
to be his cover model.


2175
01:44:05.099 --> 01:44:06.797
<i>Cover model!</i>
Yes.


2176
01:44:06.927 --> 01:44:08.799
You wanna take it
easy there, <i>l'Anglais.</i>


2177
01:44:13.717 --> 01:44:15.458
Drink more wine, Dad.

2178
01:44:17.982 --> 01:44:19.418
She'd be so happy.

2179
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:21.725
You know,
I never told you,


2180
01:44:21.986 --> 01:44:24.249
I have a pretty funny story
about her and the ring.


2181
01:44:24.597 --> 01:44:26.512
You do? Really?

2182
01:44:26.991 --> 01:44:29.515
No, it wasn't
actually that funny.


2183
01:44:29.646 --> 01:44:31.038
It was pretty traumatic,
- so never mind.
- What?


2184
01:44:31.169 --> 01:44:32.953
No, tell us. <i>Oui, oui.</i>

2185
01:44:33.084 --> 01:44:34.825
- No.
- What's the story?


2186
01:44:34.955 --> 01:44:37.393
What story
about my mother?[IN FRENCH] I think I know it.


2187
01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:38.742
Pass the cauliflower, please!

2188
01:44:39.003 --> 01:44:40.787
There will be
no <i>chou-fleur</i> until you tell us.


2189
01:44:40.918 --> 01:44:42.006
No, <i>jamais.</i>

2190
01:44:42.136 --> 01:44:44.182
How about a toast
to change the subject?


2191
01:44:44.269 --> 01:44:45.401
To family!

2192
01:44:48.273 --> 01:44:50.362
It's "familla"? <i>"Famille."</i>

2193
01:44:50.449 --> 01:44:52.146
<i>AÀ la familla! "Famille."</i>

2194
01:44:52.277 --> 01:44:54.148
<i>AÀ la famille. 
AÀ la famille!</i>
