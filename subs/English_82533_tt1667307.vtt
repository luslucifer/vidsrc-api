1
00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:08.249
- Look.
- Where?


2
00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:09.959
There.

3
00:01:12.212 --> 00:01:14.338
Yes. I think so.

4
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.471
Hello.

5
00:01:23.432 --> 00:01:25.850
Are you a new student?

6
00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:28.895
- Yes.
- Good. We thought so.


7
00:01:29.062 --> 00:01:30.438
We'd like to help you.

8
00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:33.566
Help me? What do you mean?

9
00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:36.736
As a freshman, it can be very tough.

10
00:01:36.904 --> 00:01:40.406
You get to college and it's supposed
to be great, but it's not.


11
00:01:40.574 --> 00:01:42.366
University life can be pretty bad.

12
00:01:42.534 --> 00:01:45.953
- There are a lot of suicides.
- Well, attempted ones.


13
00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:48.789
I'm not actually a freshman.
I'm a transfer student.


14
00:01:48.957 --> 00:01:52.293
- Oh, an entering sophomore?
- Yes.


15
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:55.129
You were unhappy
and are looking to recover here.


16
00:01:55.297 --> 00:01:57.632
- Well, I think you will.
- Yes.


17
00:01:58.634 --> 00:02:02.219
Would you welcome that? Would our
help be something you'd appreciate?


18
00:02:02.387 --> 00:02:05.097
Or would you rather sink or swim
on your own?


19
00:02:05.265 --> 00:02:09.352
- Either way is fine. We'll be friends.
- Yes, whichever you'd prefer.


20
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.646
Yes. Sure.

21
00:02:11.813 --> 00:02:14.941
Great. We should start immediately.

22
00:02:15.108 --> 00:02:19.820
Clothes can be crucial for confidence
and an overall sense of well-being.


23
00:02:19.988 --> 00:02:23.866
- Clothes don't have to be expensive.
- You need friends of the same size.


24
00:02:24.034 --> 00:02:27.328
- You don't like my clothes?
- I'm just saying. Move it out.


25
00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:29.330
What? What's wrong?

26
00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:35.670
- What's wrong?
- You didn't notice that?


27
00:02:35.837 --> 00:02:39.131
- No. What?
- Those guys.


28
00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.176
That smell. That awful, acrid odor.

29
00:02:44.513 --> 00:02:46.847
Have you heard
of nasal shock syndrome?


30
00:02:47.015 --> 00:02:51.477
Any harsh, acrid or just disgusting
odor sends rose into nasal shock.


31
00:02:51.645 --> 00:02:53.354
Just from some Bo?

32
00:02:54.523 --> 00:02:57.692
"Just some Bo"? 
Oh, my God, lily.

33
00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.695
You must have
a very high threshold for pain.


34
00:03:00.862 --> 00:03:02.822
That'll serve you well
at seven oaks.


35
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.866
- What do you mean?
- Seven oaks is notorious for its Bo.


36
00:03:06.034 --> 00:03:08.494
It was the last of the select seven
to go coed.


37
00:03:08.662 --> 00:03:11.205
An atmosphere
of male barbarism predominates...


38
00:03:11.373 --> 00:03:13.541
- ...but we're going to change that.
- Yes.


39
00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.543
Where are you going?

40
00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:19.547
Gotta get to the housing department.
They lost my rooming assignment.


41
00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:22.258
That's terrible.
You have no place to stay?


42
00:03:22.426 --> 00:03:23.551
Was it just mislaid?

43
00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.679
No, there were more acceptances
than they anticipated...


44
00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:30.349
And not enough rooms
to go around, so...


45
00:03:30.517 --> 00:03:32.059
Why don't you stay with us?

46
00:03:33.228 --> 00:03:34.395
Really?

47
00:03:39.693 --> 00:03:43.696
Don't think of this in the old-fashioned
sense of going to a party...


48
00:03:43.864 --> 00:03:46.866
To find someone
or not find someone.


49
00:03:47.034 --> 00:03:49.535
That's not the dynamic
that we're talking about.


50
00:03:49.703 --> 00:03:52.455
- What dynamic are you talking about?
- Glad you asked.


51
00:03:52.622 --> 00:03:57.752
Our going to a party of this kind
is more a form of youth outreach.


52
00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.962
- Of what?
- Youth outreach.


53
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.965
It's not just some moronic
frat-house social function.


54
00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:04.592
Though it will be that too.

55
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.637
We've gotta keep in mind
that these guys are young people.


56
00:04:08.805 --> 00:04:13.476
They're essentially immature
and crying out for help and guidance.


57
00:04:13.643 --> 00:04:16.604
- Though they don't know it.
- No, they don't, but we do.


58
00:04:16.772 --> 00:04:20.941
- Aren't they the same age as we are?
- Only numerically.


59
00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:25.780
I'm a lot fatter than you are,
but I think we could pin it.


60
00:04:25.947 --> 00:04:28.991
Oh, my gosh, that's beautiful.

61
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:32.036
Stunning.

62
00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:38.125
Take Frank, my friend.

63
00:04:38.293 --> 00:04:41.837
He's not some cool, handsome,
studly macho type.


64
00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:45.508
No, not at all.
I can't stand guys like that.


65
00:04:45.675 --> 00:04:48.427
He's more of a sad sack really,
wouldn't you say?


66
00:04:48.595 --> 00:04:51.514
- Definitely.
- What is a sad sack?


67
00:04:51.681 --> 00:04:52.723
A loser.

68
00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:55.392
- You like losers?
- Very much so.


69
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.354
Do you know what's the major problem
in social life?


70
00:04:58.522 --> 00:04:59.563
What?

71
00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:03.567
The tendency, widespread, to always
seek someone cooler than yourself.


72
00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:06.070
It's always a stretch.
Often a big stretch.


73
00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:08.280
Why not find someone
who's inferior?


74
00:05:08.448 --> 00:05:11.325
- Someone like Frank.
- Yes. It's more rewarding.


75
00:05:11.493 --> 00:05:14.245
And, in fact, quite reassuring.

76
00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:17.623
You mean someone you can help,
not just thinking of yourself.


77
00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:22.378
Yes, that's it, precisely. But without
the goody-goody implications.


78
00:05:22.546 --> 00:05:24.630
Our aspirations are pretty basic.

79
00:05:24.798 --> 00:05:27.550
Take a guy who hasn't realized
his full potential...


80
00:05:27.717 --> 00:05:29.343
Or doesn't even have much...

81
00:05:29.511 --> 00:05:33.472
And then help him realize it
or find more.


82
00:05:36.768 --> 00:05:40.855
There's enough material here
for a lifetime of social work.


83
00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:49.280
What's really worrisome
is that that was intentional.


84
00:05:55.912 --> 00:05:57.037
Frank.

85
00:05:58.832 --> 00:06:00.833
Frank, this is lily.

86
00:06:01.001 --> 00:06:04.837
She's just come to seven oaks
as a transfer student. Isn't she great?


87
00:06:05.005 --> 00:06:07.423
Lily failed
or wasn't happy at her last school.


88
00:06:07.591 --> 00:06:09.758
We're sure that she's going
to adapt here.


89
00:06:09.926 --> 00:06:12.261
- In fact, she already has.
- Oh, good.


90
00:06:13.013 --> 00:06:15.723
Oh, my God. A golden oldie.

91
00:06:16.224 --> 00:06:18.392
I love these.

92
00:07:07.275 --> 00:07:11.070
- Oh, my gosh. Wasn't that great?
- That was really fun.


93
00:07:11.238 --> 00:07:14.615
I know that people can have
useful careers in many areas.


94
00:07:14.783 --> 00:07:17.618
Medicine, government, law, finance.

95
00:07:17.786 --> 00:07:19.620
- Education.
- Yes, even education.


96
00:07:19.788 --> 00:07:23.332
But I'd like to do something
especially significant in my lifetime.


97
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.918
That could change the course
of human history.


98
00:07:26.086 --> 00:07:28.629
- Such as starting a new dance craze.
- Really?


99
00:07:28.797 --> 00:07:31.173
Yes. Something that could
improve the lives...


100
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:33.300
Of every person and every couple.

101
00:07:37.847 --> 00:07:40.849
I'm so proud
of what you accomplished last night.


102
00:07:41.017 --> 00:07:43.352
You showed those guys
a really good time.


103
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.981
Without anything really bad
happening. That's good.


104
00:07:47.148 --> 00:07:49.817
The guys you know,
are they all greeks?


105
00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:52.778
- What?
- Are all the guys you know greeks?


106
00:07:52.946 --> 00:07:54.738
Excuse me. I don't understand.

107
00:07:54.906 --> 00:08:00.494
Are all the guys you know greeks?

108
00:08:01.496 --> 00:08:05.124
- I don't think we know any greeks.
- Greeks, like frat boys.


109
00:08:05.292 --> 00:08:06.542
Oh, yes. Fraternities.

110
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.336
You mean members
of the Greek-letter fraternities.


111
00:08:09.504 --> 00:08:11.005
Yeah. Like last night.

112
00:08:11.172 --> 00:08:14.466
Actually, last night
we were at the du house. Du.


113
00:08:14.634 --> 00:08:16.093
Roman letters. Not Greek.

114
00:08:16.261 --> 00:08:19.305
Seven oaks has never had
a Greek-letter fraternity system.


115
00:08:19.472 --> 00:08:22.016
It's always been
a roman-letter system here.


116
00:08:22.183 --> 00:08:24.351
It's very different.

117
00:08:27.397 --> 00:08:31.066
- What house is this?
- Oh, this isn't a fraternity.


118
00:08:31.234 --> 00:08:33.902
At least not one anyone
should want to join.


119
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:38.198
You probably think we're frivolous,
empty-headed college coeds.


120
00:08:38.366 --> 00:08:40.909
You're probably right.
I often feel empty-headed.


121
00:08:41.077 --> 00:08:43.787
We're trying to make a difference
in people's lives.


122
00:08:43.955 --> 00:08:47.082
One way to do that is to stop them
from killing themselves.


123
00:08:48.752 --> 00:08:51.879
Have you ever heard of
"prevention is nine-tenths the cure"?


124
00:08:52.047 --> 00:08:55.382
Well, in the case of suicide,
it's actually 10-tenths the cure.


125
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.969
- Those are clichés, aren't they?
- Yes, they are.


126
00:08:59.554 --> 00:09:03.349
It's interesting you say that. I love
clichés and hackneyed expressions.


127
00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:05.142
- Do you know why?
- No.


128
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.894
Because they're largely true.

129
00:09:07.062 --> 00:09:09.229
The hundreds,
perhaps thousands...


130
00:09:09.397 --> 00:09:11.815
Of such clichés
and hackneyed expressions...


131
00:09:11.983 --> 00:09:14.151
That our language
has bequeathed us...


132
00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:17.863
Are a stunning treasure trove
of human insight and knowledge.


133
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:20.741
- Really?
- Yes. Oh, please sit down.


134
00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:23.160
During these formative
college years...


135
00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:26.997
We should learn as many clichéd
and hackneyed thoughts as possible.


136
00:09:27.165 --> 00:09:28.707
Furthermore, I think we will.

137
00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:32.878
Speaking of suicide prevention,
do you have a boyfriend, lily?


138
00:09:33.046 --> 00:09:35.839
- Are you dating anyone?
- I don't see the connection.


139
00:09:36.007 --> 00:09:39.301
- You don't?
- Boyfriends are a primary suicide risk.


140
00:09:39.469 --> 00:09:42.262
You don't have
any particular friend?


141
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.348
No one at all?

142
00:09:44.516 --> 00:09:48.477
No. Well, there's this grad student
I met over summer.


143
00:09:48.645 --> 00:09:52.981
Xavier.
We became pretty good pals.


144
00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:56.860
He has a girlfriend whom I've met.
She's very nice.


145
00:09:57.028 --> 00:09:58.612
"Zavier." With a Z?

146
00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.532
- No, I think it's with an X.
- No, I'm certain it's Z.


147
00:10:01.699 --> 00:10:05.327
Zavier, like Zorro.
It's the same sound.


148
00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:07.996
Zorro marked his name with a Z.

149
00:10:08.915 --> 00:10:10.666
It's an X.

150
00:10:10.834 --> 00:10:12.751
But Zorro's with a Z.

151
00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:15.087
Okay, let me see
if I can figure this out.


152
00:10:15.255 --> 00:10:21.218
Used at the beginning of a name,
Z and X have the same pronunciation.


153
00:10:21.386 --> 00:10:25.180
- But it's Zorro with a Z.
- Actually, there were two Zorro.


154
00:10:25.348 --> 00:10:29.476
One spelled his name with a Z
and made a Z mark for Zorro.


155
00:10:29.644 --> 00:10:32.604
And there's Xorro
who spelled his name with an X...


156
00:10:32.772 --> 00:10:35.107
And with his sword
he'd make an X mark.


157
00:10:35.275 --> 00:10:38.694
What was really unfair was
because he marked his name with X...


158
00:10:38.862 --> 00:10:40.988
Everybody assumed
he was illiterate...


159
00:10:41.614 --> 00:10:43.407
When he was spelling correctly.

160
00:10:43.575 --> 00:10:44.825
- Hello.
- Can we help you?


161
00:10:44.993 --> 00:10:47.494
Of course we can.
No case is too challenging.


162
00:10:47.662 --> 00:10:49.413
- Would you like a doughnut?
- Okay.


163
00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:50.622
Please, sit down.

164
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.833
- Here, have some coffee.
- Thank you.


165
00:10:53.001 --> 00:10:54.460
- What's your name?
- Jim bose.


166
00:10:54.627 --> 00:10:57.171
- But my friends call me jimbo.
- Why?


167
00:10:57.547 --> 00:10:59.965
- What?
- Why do your friends call you jimbo?


168
00:11:00.133 --> 00:11:04.470
Well, it's a contraction of Jim and
the first part of my last name, bose.


169
00:11:04.637 --> 00:11:06.680
Yeah, I got that. 
But why bother?

170
00:11:06.848 --> 00:11:09.850
- What do you mean?
- Jim is already a lovely name.


171
00:11:10.018 --> 00:11:12.019
It's short, simple, evocative.

172
00:11:12.187 --> 00:11:15.105
Shouldn't a nickname
simplify the name that it replaces?


173
00:11:15.273 --> 00:11:17.357
Jimbo doesn't really
simplify anything.


174
00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:18.817
I don't know.

175
00:11:18.985 --> 00:11:21.320
Well, maybe you should ask
your friends.


176
00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:23.697
Where do you live or reside?

177
00:11:23.865 --> 00:11:25.866
Doar dorm.

178
00:11:26.034 --> 00:11:27.409
- Oh, my God. Yuck.
- What?


179
00:11:28.119 --> 00:11:30.579
- The smell, it's notorious.
- What smell?


180
00:11:31.289 --> 00:11:35.626
You're right, it's more like a stink.
Unclean clothing, I'd say, mostly.


181
00:11:35.793 --> 00:11:37.377
- Vomit.
- Stale beer.


182
00:11:37.545 --> 00:11:40.589
Pot. Cheap deodorant.
There might be a vermin infestation.


183
00:11:40.757 --> 00:11:43.008
Did you know
a good-smelling environment...


184
00:11:43.176 --> 00:11:45.302
Is crucial to our sense
of well-being?


185
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.055
Have you tried to find
a better-smelling place?


186
00:11:48.223 --> 00:11:51.141
Wait, wait.
It's not me, I'm not depressed.


187
00:11:52.477 --> 00:11:53.769
- You're not?
- No.


188
00:11:55.396 --> 00:11:57.564
Are you sure?
You kind of seem on edge.


189
00:11:57.732 --> 00:12:01.568
- No, I'm fine.
- That's a terrible expression. "Fine."


190
00:12:01.736 --> 00:12:03.195
"I'm fine."

191
00:12:03.404 --> 00:12:07.533
Something smug about it. "I'm fine."

192
00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.537
- Why do you say that you're fine?
- I'm not depressed. I'm not suicidal.


193
00:12:14.123 --> 00:12:16.416
Why are you here, then?
Are you a con man?


194
00:12:16.584 --> 00:12:19.002
- A confidence trickster?
- No, there's a girl.


195
00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.256
Her boyfriend dumped her.
She was crying but now is silent.


196
00:12:22.423 --> 00:12:24.299
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you say so?


197
00:12:25.969 --> 00:12:29.304
We have to go. Call the cops!
A suicide might be in progress!


198
00:12:29.472 --> 00:12:32.432
- The campus cops?
- Yes, of course the campus cops.


199
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.850
Take this.

200
00:12:34.018 --> 00:12:36.895
We have a lot of students
coming to the center...


201
00:12:37.063 --> 00:12:39.481
Pretending to be depressed
to get doughnuts.


202
00:12:39.649 --> 00:12:43.110
- Confidence tricksters.
- Yes, it's really bad. Really cynical.


203
00:12:43.278 --> 00:12:45.195
We pledged
to the doughnut company...


204
00:12:45.363 --> 00:12:48.949
We would only give doughnuts
to students who were depressed...


205
00:12:49.117 --> 00:12:50.492
Or otherwise nutty.

206
00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.954
We're a nonprofit,
so the rules are pretty strict.


207
00:12:54.122 --> 00:12:57.958
- This man could still be a trickster.
- Well, we'll soon find out.


208
00:12:58.126 --> 00:12:59.418
Tell me about this girl.

209
00:12:59.586 --> 00:13:02.087
Well, her name is priss.
She's very pretty.


210
00:13:02.255 --> 00:13:07.801
Oh, yes. It's very hard for beautiful
women to experience rejection.


211
00:13:10.054 --> 00:13:13.890
Priss? Priss. Are you okay?

212
00:13:14.058 --> 00:13:17.811
Priss! Priss, say something!

213
00:13:19.063 --> 00:13:21.815
Priss! Open up!

214
00:13:23.693 --> 00:13:27.863
Oh, thank God.
We're gonna have to force this door.


215
00:13:28.906 --> 00:13:30.991
Priss? Are you okay?

216
00:13:33.703 --> 00:13:37.623
- What?
- Please don't. Please, come with us.


217
00:13:47.592 --> 00:13:50.093
Do you wanna talk about it?

218
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:52.429
What was his name?

219
00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:54.264
Josh.

220
00:13:55.683 --> 00:13:57.893
If you'd rather not talk,
we don't have to.


221
00:13:58.061 --> 00:14:00.354
No, it's okay, I just...

222
00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:05.734
I keep thinking how he used to gaze
at me with such love in his eyes.


223
00:14:05.902 --> 00:14:07.694
You know what I mean?

224
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:14.534
No. No, I've never
actually seen that.


225
00:14:15.286 --> 00:14:19.289
Yes. Just days ago,
he'd gaze at me.


226
00:14:19.457 --> 00:14:22.417
His eyes, so blue.

227
00:14:23.211 --> 00:14:25.212
He had blue eyes?

228
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.964
So does Frank.
Frank's the guy that I go out with.


229
00:14:28.132 --> 00:14:32.594
Otherwise, he's not conventionally
good-looking, which I actually prefer.


230
00:14:33.638 --> 00:14:37.307
Would you describe Josh
as handsome?


231
00:14:37.975 --> 00:14:41.228
- That's a problem.
- Could I join you guys?


232
00:14:42.063 --> 00:14:46.733
Yes, please.
Priss and I were just talking.


233
00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:50.237
In my view,
handsome men are to be avoided.


234
00:14:50.405 --> 00:14:53.448
I don't even consider good looks
to be flattering in a man.


235
00:14:53.616 --> 00:14:56.410
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.


236
00:14:59.038 --> 00:15:03.542
Cookie-cutter, good-looking guys,
with their chiseled features...


237
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.752
Running around,
full of themselves...


238
00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.423
Getting everything they want,
never suffering or experiencing...


239
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:11.133
We suffered?

240
00:15:12.135 --> 00:15:16.596
We're not under discussion. That's
irrelevant. That's besides the point.


241
00:15:18.099 --> 00:15:22.561
- Is this making you feel any better?
- Yes. I think so.


242
00:15:23.104 --> 00:15:24.479
Good. I hoped it would.

243
00:15:28.359 --> 00:15:32.529
Okay, it's nearly 4 and the daily
complainer's orientation meeting...


244
00:15:32.697 --> 00:15:35.282
Is about to start
and I think we should go.


245
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.493
The editor, Rick dewolfe,
he's terrible. A real jerk.


246
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:40.787
Why do you think he's such a jerk?

247
00:15:41.372 --> 00:15:43.957
He's one of those
that I was talking about. Tall.


248
00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:47.461
Probably considers himself
very smart and handsome.


249
00:15:47.628 --> 00:15:51.882
A journalist, so you can imagine the
mind-boggling arrogance and conceit.


250
00:15:52.049 --> 00:15:56.720
- But, Violet, don't you think...?
- What?


251
00:15:56.888 --> 00:16:01.308
Well, don't you think that the way you
talk could be considered arrogant too?


252
00:16:01.476 --> 00:16:03.143
I mean, a little?

253
00:16:03.311 --> 00:16:06.396
Yes, of course.
But what's your point?


254
00:16:06.564 --> 00:16:09.149
Wouldn't that be hypocritical,
criticizing Rick...


255
00:16:09.317 --> 00:16:12.152
For something
you could be criticized for yourself?


256
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.114
No. I don't see why.
We're all flawed.


257
00:16:16.282 --> 00:16:19.242
Must that render us mute
to the flaws of others?


258
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:21.536
Must we tether ourselves
from comment...


259
00:16:21.704 --> 00:16:24.706
Because our natures
are human too?


260
00:16:26.334 --> 00:16:28.418
We've got a rebel amongst us.

261
00:16:28.586 --> 00:16:31.922
That's good, I think. It's good
to be challenged and criticized.


262
00:16:32.089 --> 00:16:34.508
I know your intentions are good,
it's just...


263
00:16:34.675 --> 00:16:37.969
That's it precisely.
Our intentions are good.


264
00:16:38.137 --> 00:16:41.181
We're seeking to help people
rescue their lives...


265
00:16:41.349 --> 00:16:44.100
From terrible sadness and failure...

266
00:16:44.268 --> 00:16:46.520
Which is a worthy goal,
don't you think?


267
00:16:46.687 --> 00:16:50.106
Yes. But not exactly a humble one.

268
00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:52.108
No.

269
00:16:52.276 --> 00:16:55.362
I agree with you there.
You're right, absolutely.


270
00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.198
I'd like to thank you
for this chastisement.


271
00:16:58.366 --> 00:17:01.618
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to chastise.
- No, I think you did...


272
00:17:01.786 --> 00:17:03.203
And I think it's good.

273
00:17:03.371 --> 00:17:04.871
It's good to have a friend...

274
00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:07.999
To put one in one's place
when that's what one needs.


275
00:17:08.167 --> 00:17:10.919
Now I see that I have
that kind of friend in you.


276
00:17:11.087 --> 00:17:13.088
I think that's great.

277
00:17:18.302 --> 00:17:20.637
Hello, people. Listen up.

278
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.725
People, quiet. Quiet, people.
Shut up!


279
00:17:27.895 --> 00:17:31.398
Okay, that's better. I'm Rick dewolfe,
editor of the complainer.


280
00:17:31.566 --> 00:17:35.569
Over the next weeks, I'm the person
you're gonna hate most in the world.


281
00:17:35.736 --> 00:17:38.613
You're gonna hate me because
I'm gonna work you...


282
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:41.658
Point out your stupidity
and incompetence...


283
00:17:41.826 --> 00:17:45.996
And do everything in my power
to turn you into journalists.


284
00:17:46.163 --> 00:17:49.207
- Albeit barely literate ones.
- Oh, brother.


285
00:17:52.503 --> 00:17:54.588
Any questions?

286
00:17:54.755 --> 00:17:55.797
No?

287
00:17:55.965 --> 00:17:58.717
Yes. How did the daily complainer
get its name?


288
00:18:00.678 --> 00:18:02.929
Isn't that pretty obvious?

289
00:18:04.265 --> 00:18:08.435
It comes out every day
and it's the university daily.


290
00:18:08.603 --> 00:18:12.439
So the daily complainer.

291
00:18:12.607 --> 00:18:14.399
- The daily...
- No, I meant...


292
00:18:14.567 --> 00:18:16.776
Oh, you mean,
why the complainer?


293
00:18:16.944 --> 00:18:20.447
The name dates from seven oaks'
earliest days as a divinity school.


294
00:18:20.615 --> 00:18:24.284
The reference is to the book of job.
Job's complaint with the world.


295
00:18:24.452 --> 00:18:27.954
Before justice can be achieved,
a complaint must be made.


296
00:18:28.122 --> 00:18:30.832
That is what we do
and people don't like it a bit.


297
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.542
Right now, what that means...

298
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.421
Is extirpating seven oaks'
elitist roman letter clubs...


299
00:18:36.589 --> 00:18:39.132
That are like a cancer
on the community.


300
00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.343
They're not elitist in the least.

301
00:18:42.053 --> 00:18:43.470
Yes, they are.

302
00:18:43.638 --> 00:18:47.349
Have you met any of their members?
The guys from the du, for example?


303
00:18:47.516 --> 00:18:50.477
They're barely competent
for the tasks of everyday life.


304
00:18:50.645 --> 00:18:53.939
They have to drink a quart of beer
just to talk to a woman?


305
00:18:54.106 --> 00:18:56.566
- Two quarts.
- Yet you salivate at the idea...


306
00:18:56.734 --> 00:19:00.487
Of taking the roof off their heads
and throwing them on the street...


307
00:19:00.655 --> 00:19:04.282
Where who knows what would
happen. You call yourself a Christian.


308
00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:07.786
- No, I don't.
- What unkindness and cruelty.


309
00:19:07.954 --> 00:19:11.831
This is the darkness in the heart
of man, which Joseph Conrad...


310
00:19:11.999 --> 00:19:13.625
Wrote about most eloquently.

311
00:19:14.752 --> 00:19:16.711
- He was actually Polish.
- Oh, my God.


312
00:19:16.879 --> 00:19:20.048
Unkind, self-righteous
and pedantic.


313
00:19:20.216 --> 00:19:22.968
In short, a model journalist.

314
00:19:23.135 --> 00:19:25.387
You should know something
about these girls.


315
00:19:25.554 --> 00:19:29.516
They run the suicide center where
their preferred therapy for depressed...


316
00:19:29.684 --> 00:19:32.477
And suicidal people is...

317
00:19:33.104 --> 00:19:34.145
Tap dancing.

318
00:19:36.691 --> 00:19:41.528
- I kid you not.
- Tap is a highly effective therapy...


319
00:19:41.696 --> 00:19:44.364
As well as a dazzlingly
expressive dance form...


320
00:19:44.532 --> 00:19:47.492
That has been sadly neglected
for too many years.


321
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.995
It's moronic and barbaric.

322
00:19:50.162 --> 00:19:52.872
You expect tap dancing
to solve people's problems?


323
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.708
No, we don't.

324
00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:57.877
We're using the whole range
of musical dance numbers...


325
00:19:58.045 --> 00:20:01.256
Which have proven themselves
to be effective therapies...


326
00:20:01.424 --> 00:20:04.217
For the suicidal
and the hopelessly depressed.


327
00:20:09.306 --> 00:20:11.558
That really got me down.

328
00:20:11.726 --> 00:20:16.730
- I thought you handled it well.
- You did? Thanks.


329
00:20:17.398 --> 00:20:21.067
No, it's all this aggression
and hostility that gets me down.


330
00:20:21.235 --> 00:20:26.197
Not just his but also my own.
It leaves you feeling unclean.


331
00:20:26.365 --> 00:20:29.617
Have you thought of taking a shower?
Maybe you'd feel better.


332
00:20:29.785 --> 00:20:33.121
You're probably right.
No, there's something else.


333
00:20:33.289 --> 00:20:36.791
What lily was saying about me
being conceited and arrogant.


334
00:20:36.959 --> 00:20:40.253
- I'm sorry.
- No, I think you're right.


335
00:20:40.421 --> 00:20:42.088
I'm really ashamed.

336
00:20:43.049 --> 00:20:45.925
- You're joking.
- No, it's terrible how I've acted.


337
00:20:46.093 --> 00:20:47.761
We're all christians.

338
00:20:47.928 --> 00:20:52.098
Or I should say judeo-christians.

339
00:20:52.516 --> 00:20:57.020
Humility should be our watchword.
The essence of being a good person.


340
00:20:57.188 --> 00:20:59.397
Humility comes from within.

341
00:20:59.565 --> 00:21:02.901
If it's not there in the first place,
where do you go to get it?


342
00:21:03.069 --> 00:21:05.570
I stopped looking a long time ago.

343
00:21:15.956 --> 00:21:18.124
Very good, freak.

344
00:21:18.292 --> 00:21:21.336
- You really think so?
- Yes. Certainly.


345
00:21:24.548 --> 00:21:27.300
- Five, six, seven, eight.
- Violet.


346
00:21:28.886 --> 00:21:31.012
Is it such a good idea
to call him freak?


347
00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.806
What?

348
00:21:32.973 --> 00:21:35.642
He's already depressed
and you're calling him freak.


349
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:39.687
That's his name. Freak. Freak Astaire.
That's how he wants to be called.


350
00:21:39.855 --> 00:21:41.856
What are you talking about?

351
00:21:42.024 --> 00:21:44.484
Lily was just saying
she likes your dancing.


352
00:21:48.405 --> 00:21:50.323
Five, six, seven, eight.

353
00:21:58.124 --> 00:21:59.541
Are you okay?

354
00:21:59.708 --> 00:22:01.334
What do you mean?

355
00:22:01.502 --> 00:22:03.837
I thought you looked sad
and was wondering...


356
00:22:04.004 --> 00:22:07.215
- ...if there was anything we could do.
- What could you do?


357
00:22:07.383 --> 00:22:08.424
Oh, I know.

358
00:22:08.592 --> 00:22:11.719
You think I'm gonna kill myself
and make you look bad.


359
00:22:11.887 --> 00:22:15.890
No, I'm worried that you'll kill yourself
and make yourself look bad.


360
00:22:16.058 --> 00:22:19.394
Do you have any idea
how demoralizing it is...


361
00:22:19.562 --> 00:22:23.314
To be constantly questioned
about whether you're suicidal or not?


362
00:22:23.482 --> 00:22:24.524
No.

363
00:22:24.692 --> 00:22:27.819
After a while, you wonder,
why is everyone asking me this?


364
00:22:27.987 --> 00:22:29.445
They want me to be suicidal?

365
00:22:29.613 --> 00:22:32.490
Or is it just the consequence
of your utter absurdity?


366
00:22:32.658 --> 00:22:33.908
Excuse me.

367
00:22:34.076 --> 00:22:35.827
What scent are you wearing?

368
00:22:35.995 --> 00:22:38.997
- What are you talking about?
- The perfume you're wearing.


369
00:22:39.165 --> 00:22:41.499
I'm not wearing any perfume!

370
00:22:42.293 --> 00:22:45.295
You see, that could be the problem.

371
00:22:47.339 --> 00:22:49.632
- I've become friends with a group.
- Really?


372
00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.053
- Although they're perfume-obsessed.
- Oh, them? Those girls?


373
00:22:54.805 --> 00:22:56.723
The ones who volunteer
at the center?


374
00:22:56.891 --> 00:22:58.349
- Yeah.
- But they're terrible.


375
00:22:58.517 --> 00:23:00.435
The blond one? 
She's notorious.

376
00:23:00.603 --> 00:23:03.396
- What do you mean?
- Such a bitch. Terrible, isn't she?


377
00:23:03.564 --> 00:23:05.732
- Would balsamic be okay?
- What?


378
00:23:06.483 --> 00:23:09.235
Balsamic vinegar. 
For the dressing.

379
00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.071
Yeah, sure.

380
00:23:16.493 --> 00:23:18.244
- What's that?
- What?


381
00:23:18.412 --> 00:23:20.955
- Those.
- Artichokes?


382
00:23:21.123 --> 00:23:23.249
Ls that what they look like?

383
00:23:23.417 --> 00:23:26.336
Come on, lily.
You've seen an artichoke before.


384
00:23:27.171 --> 00:23:29.923
- You haven't?
- They look so weird.


385
00:23:36.055 --> 00:23:39.474
I'm not convinced that having
a suicide-prevention center...


386
00:23:39.642 --> 00:23:42.018
Prevents any suicides.

387
00:23:42.186 --> 00:23:44.103
Well, the coffee's good.

388
00:23:44.271 --> 00:23:47.190
If someone were determined
to destroy themselves...


389
00:23:47.358 --> 00:23:51.402
- ...I don't think they'd stop for coffee.
- Lt depends on what it tastes like.


390
00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.906
- Where are we going?
- I thought I'd take priss over to du.


391
00:23:55.074 --> 00:23:56.115
Why?

392
00:23:56.283 --> 00:23:59.035
It might be helpful
for her to meet some of the guys.


393
00:23:59.203 --> 00:24:01.371
How would that be helpful?
They're morons.


394
00:24:01.538 --> 00:24:03.623
- Oh, come on, lily.
- No, they're morons.


395
00:24:03.791 --> 00:24:07.210
No. Not medically. I like them.

396
00:24:07.378 --> 00:24:10.630
They're in that sympathetic range
of being not good-looking...


397
00:24:10.798 --> 00:24:14.175
And yet not smart.
There's something likable about that.


398
00:24:14.343 --> 00:24:18.471
Spending time with them, you get the
sense that you're making a difference.


399
00:24:18.639 --> 00:24:21.849
For somebody suicidal, like priss,
that could be a real boost.


400
00:24:22.017 --> 00:24:24.852
- I'm not suicidal.
- Oh, that's good.


401
00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:30.483
It's better not to have an identity
as a suicidal person, don't you think?


402
00:24:31.485 --> 00:24:34.654
- Well, bye.
- Well...


403
00:24:35.322 --> 00:24:37.824
- Where are you going?
- Over to Xavier's.


404
00:24:38.575 --> 00:24:41.160
- Is that a good idea?
- Why wouldn't it be?


405
00:24:41.328 --> 00:24:44.789
- Is his girlfriend gonna be there?
- Of course.


406
00:24:44.957 --> 00:24:48.960
- Gosh, you're nosy.
- No, no, it's just a general foreboding.


407
00:24:49.128 --> 00:24:51.129
"Foreboding"?

408
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:57.176
You know, you're absolutely right.
I was being nosy.


409
00:24:57.344 --> 00:24:59.554
Terribly so.

410
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:03.224
- I've gotta watch that.
- Yes, we must improve ourselves.


411
00:25:04.268 --> 00:25:06.978
- Bye.
- Bye.


412
00:25:07.146 --> 00:25:08.354
Bye.

413
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.947
Lily.

414
00:25:18.449 --> 00:25:22.285
- You were coming over?
- Hey. Yeah. Ls Alice home?


415
00:25:22.453 --> 00:25:24.245
Alice is working.

416
00:25:24.413 --> 00:25:26.331
- Oh, she is?
- But it's not a problem.


417
00:25:26.498 --> 00:25:27.540
It's good you came.

418
00:25:27.708 --> 00:25:30.376
Let's go to the oak bar.
I'll buy you a beer.


419
00:25:30.544 --> 00:25:34.213
- I thought Alice would be back.
- I'll call her. She'll join us there.


420
00:25:35.132 --> 00:25:36.799
Come on.

421
00:25:36.967 --> 00:25:38.009
Okay.

422
00:25:38.177 --> 00:25:40.053
She's actually quite a good person.

423
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.222
Her entire identity
revolves around helping people.


424
00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:45.350
You really think that's true?

425
00:25:45.517 --> 00:25:48.728
What's she have against
the complainer? That's bizarre.


426
00:25:48.896 --> 00:25:52.732
Well, she thinks the editor, Rick
dewolfe, is completely egotistical.


427
00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.400
And your friend isn't?

428
00:25:54.568 --> 00:25:55.902
- Hi.
- Hi.


429
00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.111
- Hi, lily.
- Hi.


430
00:25:57.279 --> 00:25:59.280
- Great. You got the message.
- Yeah.


431
00:26:01.075 --> 00:26:03.076
- Who's egotistical?
- Lily's roommate.


432
00:26:03.243 --> 00:26:06.788
She sounds unbearable. She's on
a rampage against the complainer.


433
00:26:06.955 --> 00:26:08.039
Really? Why?

434
00:26:08.207 --> 00:26:11.918
She thinks the editor,
Rick dewolfe, is conceited.


435
00:26:12.086 --> 00:26:14.754
- And, in fact, quite mean.
- Mean?


436
00:26:14.922 --> 00:26:17.924
Yes. He wants to close
the seven oaks roman letter clubs.


437
00:26:18.092 --> 00:26:20.802
That's good, isn't it?
Everyone was against them.


438
00:26:20.969 --> 00:26:22.720
- No.
- Come on.


439
00:26:22.888 --> 00:26:25.306
There's no justification
for those places.


440
00:26:25.474 --> 00:26:27.392
They're exclusive and elitist.

441
00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:31.229
The point that Violet makes
is that they can't be elitist.


442
00:26:31.397 --> 00:26:34.440
- They're morons.
- Yeah, elitist morons.


443
00:26:34.608 --> 00:26:37.068
You'll grant they're morons.
That's a handicap.


444
00:26:37.236 --> 00:26:41.739
Such people should be helped,
not hounded and persecuted.


445
00:26:41.907 --> 00:26:45.076
- Persecuted?
- Yes, losing the roof over your head?


446
00:26:45.244 --> 00:26:47.495
That's the worst thing
that can happen.


447
00:26:47.663 --> 00:26:50.415
Violet thinks there could be
some risk of suicide.


448
00:26:50.582 --> 00:26:54.627
Because some boy might kill himself,
seven oaks can't do what's right?


449
00:26:54.795 --> 00:26:56.879
It's a factor to be considered.

450
00:26:57.047 --> 00:26:59.549
- Yeah.
- No, it isn't.


451
00:26:59.716 --> 00:27:01.342
You can't set policy that way.

452
00:27:02.052 --> 00:27:07.056
- Excuse me, we didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.


453
00:27:11.728 --> 00:27:16.566
That's a playboy or operator move.
Operators like that are to be avoided.


454
00:27:16.733 --> 00:27:21.154
Why? It seems generous, sending
drinks to people you don't know.


455
00:27:21.321 --> 00:27:24.198
- Drinks are expensive.
- Drinks to two gorgeous girls.


456
00:27:24.366 --> 00:27:27.493
His intention was to seduce
and he assumed he could.


457
00:27:27.661 --> 00:27:29.745
- Both?
- That seems a bit harsh.


458
00:27:29.913 --> 00:27:32.915
You don't know what he was thinking.
Was he alone?


459
00:27:33.083 --> 00:27:34.500
Yes.

460
00:27:34.668 --> 00:27:37.837
You see?
He was alone and probably lonely.


461
00:27:38.005 --> 00:27:40.590
He could see that Alice and lily
were students.


462
00:27:40.757 --> 00:27:43.551
Students are known
for their intelligent conversation.


463
00:27:43.719 --> 00:27:45.970
They can always talk
about their courses.


464
00:27:46.138 --> 00:27:48.097
That was probably
what attracted him.


465
00:27:48.265 --> 00:27:49.348
Nonsense.

466
00:27:49.516 --> 00:27:51.309
Perhaps his view was even loftier.

467
00:27:51.477 --> 00:27:53.978
To court lily
with a view to matrimony.


468
00:27:54.146 --> 00:27:56.689
We're in the north,
but a southern gentleman...


469
00:27:56.857 --> 00:27:58.649
Can wander into these parts.

470
00:27:58.817 --> 00:27:59.859
Rubbish.

471
00:28:00.027 --> 00:28:04.697
Seeing lily across a crowded bar filled
with the usual undergraduate slobs.


472
00:28:04.865 --> 00:28:07.575
Why wouldn't a thoughtful
young man seek her out?


473
00:28:07.743 --> 00:28:08.868
She's lovely.

474
00:28:09.036 --> 00:28:13.206
Isn't it incumbent on men and women
to find ways to meet each other?


475
00:28:13.373 --> 00:28:17.543
Buying drinks for a person you don't
know seems to be a generous one.


476
00:28:17.711 --> 00:28:20.922
Yes. Most guys won't even pay
for the women they do know.


477
00:28:21.089 --> 00:28:24.091
What you've described is
a playboy or operator move.


478
00:28:24.259 --> 00:28:27.345
I'll grant you that it's a tactic
or perhaps even a ruse...


479
00:28:27.513 --> 00:28:30.681
But without some of that,
would our species even survive?


480
00:28:30.849 --> 00:28:33.184
The lord said,
"be fruitful and multiply."


481
00:28:33.352 --> 00:28:34.393
Oh, my gosh.

482
00:28:34.978 --> 00:28:38.814
No, this is how the world works,
seeing someone across a room.


483
00:28:38.982 --> 00:28:42.193
This could be the romantic story
you tell your grandchildren.


484
00:28:42.361 --> 00:28:45.112
And if you do marry
and have children...


485
00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.782
Then he'll really learn
how to squander cash.


486
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:51.911
Isn't it good to know that
he's basically generous from the start?


487
00:28:54.665 --> 00:28:56.499
Where's priss?

488
00:28:58.001 --> 00:29:01.587
Your eyes are so striking. So blue.

489
00:29:01.755 --> 00:29:04.257
- Really? They're blue?
- Yes.


490
00:29:05.175 --> 00:29:06.717
The most piercing blue.

491
00:29:07.928 --> 00:29:09.637
You must know your eyes are blue.

492
00:29:09.805 --> 00:29:13.099
- No.
- What do you mean?


493
00:29:13.267 --> 00:29:14.308
What?

494
00:29:14.476 --> 00:29:16.936
You must know
what color your eyes are.


495
00:29:17.104 --> 00:29:19.105
Your eyes are very blue.
You know that.


496
00:29:19.273 --> 00:29:22.942
I'm not gonna go around checking
what color my eyes are.


497
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:26.279
When you look in the mirror,
you see that your eyes are blue.


498
00:29:26.446 --> 00:29:29.115
- Oh, come on.
- What?


499
00:29:29.283 --> 00:29:31.158
I don't think my eyes have a color.

500
00:29:31.326 --> 00:29:36.122
If my eyes are so blue looking out,
wouldn't everything be kind of blue?


501
00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:38.624
Like, have a bluish tinge to it?

502
00:29:43.547 --> 00:29:46.465
Doesn't. Just looks normal.

503
00:29:49.052 --> 00:29:52.179
That's...? That's blue?

504
00:29:52.347 --> 00:29:54.974
- That color?
- Yes, of course.


505
00:29:55.142 --> 00:29:56.726
Then what color is that?

506
00:29:56.893 --> 00:29:58.311
Green.

507
00:29:58.478 --> 00:30:01.480
You're saying that chair's green
but Frank's eyes are blue?


508
00:30:01.648 --> 00:30:02.982
Yes.

509
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.775
Then what color are the walls?

510
00:30:04.943 --> 00:30:06.652
Also green.

511
00:30:09.239 --> 00:30:10.615
You didn't know that?

512
00:30:12.492 --> 00:30:13.659
No.

513
00:30:13.827 --> 00:30:15.369
How's that possible?

514
00:30:15.537 --> 00:30:19.165
You think knowing the colors
is so important?


515
00:30:19.333 --> 00:30:21.834
You're in college
and you don't know the colors?


516
00:30:22.002 --> 00:30:24.170
Doesn't that embarrass you?

517
00:30:24.338 --> 00:30:27.048
Well, no. Why should it?

518
00:30:27.215 --> 00:30:30.343
That's why the 'rents are paying
big bucks to send me here.


519
00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.012
You know, to learn stuff.

520
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.223
Well, gotta go hit the books.

521
00:30:41.063 --> 00:30:45.358
I don't think anyone should feel
embarrassed about not knowing stuff.


522
00:30:45.525 --> 00:30:48.361
What's embarrassing
is pretending to know.


523
00:30:48.528 --> 00:30:51.989
Or putting people down because
you think they don't know as much.


524
00:30:52.157 --> 00:30:54.742
Look, I'm happy to admit
I'm completely ignorant.


525
00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:58.037
That's why I'm here
and plan to really hit the books.


526
00:30:58.205 --> 00:31:01.332
So the next time you see me,
I will know more than I do now.


527
00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.876
I'll be older but also wiser.

528
00:31:04.044 --> 00:31:06.170
Or at least know more stuff.

529
00:31:06.338 --> 00:31:09.173
For me, that's education.

530
00:31:10.842 --> 00:31:11.884
Cheers.

531
00:31:14.638 --> 00:31:18.057
Thor's great.
He's very clear about his objectives.


532
00:31:18.225 --> 00:31:19.892
He really wants to learn things.

533
00:31:34.032 --> 00:31:35.366
Frank?

534
00:31:41.415 --> 00:31:42.456
What a jerk.

535
00:31:42.624 --> 00:31:44.667
- He's a monster.
- Oh, my gosh, Violet.


536
00:31:44.835 --> 00:31:47.795
You did everything for them.
They're nothing without you.


537
00:31:47.963 --> 00:31:50.005
- What a rat.
- He's a moron.


538
00:31:50.173 --> 00:31:53.509
- Don't waste a tear on that creep.
- Don't waste a single breath.


539
00:31:53.677 --> 00:31:54.969
- Jerk.
- Stop.


540
00:31:55.137 --> 00:31:56.929
- Please.
- What?


541
00:31:57.597 --> 00:31:59.932
I love Frank.

542
00:32:01.351 --> 00:32:03.352
I love him.

543
00:32:07.858 --> 00:32:11.110
Come on, Violet, Frank's a moron.
You are well rid of him.


544
00:32:11.278 --> 00:32:13.654
- Don't say that.
- Frank's not a moron?


545
00:32:14.114 --> 00:32:17.450
You know, lily, you're a bit harsh.

546
00:32:18.118 --> 00:32:19.827
This obsession with intelligence.

547
00:32:19.995 --> 00:32:23.414
Do you think it has some magical
quality transforming everything?


548
00:32:23.582 --> 00:32:26.375
The intelligence line
is not an immutable barrier.


549
00:32:26.543 --> 00:32:27.585
Love can cross it.

550
00:32:27.753 --> 00:32:30.796
You can love someone
whose mental capacity is not large.


551
00:32:30.964 --> 00:32:33.966
I know. I have.

552
00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:38.179
- Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.
- Frank's stupid, we knew.


553
00:32:38.346 --> 00:32:41.307
That he's a rat playboy operator,
I hadn't realized.


554
00:32:41.475 --> 00:32:43.809
I don't want to turn bitter.

555
00:32:44.144 --> 00:32:47.521
- I worry for Frank. I care about him.
- Well, I'd stop.


556
00:32:47.689 --> 00:32:48.856
No.

557
00:32:49.024 --> 00:32:50.816
I love Frank.

558
00:32:50.984 --> 00:32:52.109
I always will.

559
00:32:52.277 --> 00:32:54.820
If that's the case,
why not fight for him?


560
00:32:54.988 --> 00:32:57.782
- Against priss? I'd never win.
- Sure you would.


561
00:32:57.949 --> 00:33:01.160
Priss is a rat. A bitch.

562
00:33:01.328 --> 00:33:02.953
A rat bitch.

563
00:33:03.497 --> 00:33:05.831
Don't blame priss.

564
00:33:06.416 --> 00:33:11.170
She was crushed
when her blue-eyed Josh left her.


565
00:33:12.589 --> 00:33:14.507
I should've known.

566
00:33:14.674 --> 00:33:17.092
Of course she'd fall for Frank.

567
00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:21.430
Josh and Frank
are both blue-eyed heart-breakers.


568
00:33:27.521 --> 00:33:28.687
Poor Violet.

569
00:33:28.855 --> 00:33:31.065
She's the roommate
who's so self-confident?


570
00:33:31.233 --> 00:33:33.484
Yeah. But now she's a wreck.

571
00:33:33.652 --> 00:33:37.738
But there's no logic
to the algebra of love.


572
00:33:37.906 --> 00:33:39.490
"The algebra of love."

573
00:33:39.658 --> 00:33:41.992
That sounds like the title
to some lame book.


574
00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.495
It's a title,
but the book's not lame at all.


575
00:33:44.663 --> 00:33:47.122
Love's algebra?
I thought it was more geometry.


576
00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:49.542
Okay, the title's not good,
but the book is.


577
00:33:49.709 --> 00:33:51.210
What's it say?

578
00:33:51.378 --> 00:33:55.214
Well, that while we're all perverse
in our romantic preferences...


579
00:33:55.382 --> 00:33:59.051
There's actually this logic
or algebra to our perversity...


580
00:33:59.219 --> 00:34:03.222
And it has something to do
with how the species has evolved.


581
00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.391
- The survival of the species?
- Yes.


582
00:34:05.559 --> 00:34:08.727
And whether it will
continue to do so.


583
00:34:11.064 --> 00:34:12.398
No booze?

584
00:34:12.566 --> 00:34:16.318
Just to find the nearest package store,
you had to drive 40 miles.


585
00:34:17.654 --> 00:34:20.739
- These aren't so strong.
- No, they're really strong.


586
00:34:20.907 --> 00:34:22.241
I think I'd like another.

587
00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:25.619
- That wouldn't be a good idea.
- Why not?


588
00:34:25.787 --> 00:34:29.039
- Well...
- Are you trying to stifle me?


589
00:34:29.207 --> 00:34:31.709
- Lily?
- Oh, hi.


590
00:34:31.877 --> 00:34:35.546
Listen, we're gonna get something
to eat. Why don't you come with us?


591
00:34:35.714 --> 00:34:38.841
- I'm with Charlie.
- I can see that.


592
00:34:39.009 --> 00:34:42.094
- But you really should come.
- Why?


593
00:34:42.262 --> 00:34:44.597
I just think it
would be a good idea.

594
00:34:46.182 --> 00:34:49.852
- But why?
- You really must come. I insist.


595
00:34:51.187 --> 00:34:52.787
Lily?

596
00:34:58.028 --> 00:35:00.195
Lily, are you angry?

597
00:35:01.781 --> 00:35:04.450
Lily, this is it. We're here.

598
00:35:04.618 --> 00:35:06.619
What's the matter?

599
00:35:07.537 --> 00:35:11.123
That was so rude. He's a nice guy
and you embarrassed him.


600
00:35:11.291 --> 00:35:13.751
He's not nice.
He was trying to get you drunk.


601
00:35:13.919 --> 00:35:16.420
- No, he wasn't.
- Plying you with martinis?


602
00:35:16.588 --> 00:35:20.591
- I was plying myself with martinis.
- Come on, the guy's a total sleaze.


603
00:35:20.759 --> 00:35:23.719
- A creep.
- You don't know anything about him.


604
00:35:23.887 --> 00:35:26.764
The way he sent drinks
over to our table?


605
00:35:27.891 --> 00:35:29.433
Alice.

606
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:31.101
Alice, what's wrong?

607
00:35:31.269 --> 00:35:33.562
I had no idea
that Xavier could be so mean.


608
00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.148
Sounds as if he was just trying
to protect you.


609
00:35:36.316 --> 00:35:39.485
This Charlie Walker sounds like
an operator or playboy type.


610
00:35:39.653 --> 00:35:42.613
No, he's not like that.
He's actually a really nice guy.


611
00:35:42.781 --> 00:35:44.949
I thought he was
a slick businessman.


612
00:35:45.116 --> 00:35:48.327
No. He dresses well,
but he works in strategic development.


613
00:35:48.495 --> 00:35:51.205
- What?
- Strategic development.


614
00:35:51.373 --> 00:35:54.708
He works at SDA.
Strategic development associates.


615
00:35:54.876 --> 00:35:58.712
- He's an associate there.
- What he is, is a strategic operator.


616
00:36:02.092 --> 00:36:04.426
Violet, are you okay?

617
00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:24.822
Hey, miss, rain's coming!
Better get back!


618
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:41.046
- Polly, have you seen Violet?
- No. Ls something wrong?


619
00:36:41.214 --> 00:36:42.631
We're not sure.

620
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:47.110
Violet!

621
00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:11.326
- Violet!
- Violet! Oh, my gosh, what happened?


622
00:37:24.466 --> 00:37:27.634
I don't understand.
What were you doing?


623
00:37:28.178 --> 00:37:30.512
How long were you gone for?

624
00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.097
I'm sorry, I don't know.

625
00:37:32.265 --> 00:37:34.433
I lost track of time.

626
00:37:35.769 --> 00:37:37.269
But you feel better now?

627
00:37:38.021 --> 00:37:41.356
Well, cleaner.

628
00:37:43.735 --> 00:37:45.778
She'll say anything
to get in the show.


629
00:37:45.945 --> 00:37:48.947
- She'll want doughnuts.
- You don't have to be suicidal...


630
00:37:49.115 --> 00:37:53.035
- ...to get doughnuts, just depressed.
- Clinically depressed. From a clinic.


631
00:37:53.203 --> 00:37:56.121
- Would you say you're depressed?
- I don't like the term.


632
00:37:56.289 --> 00:37:59.500
- I prefer to say I'm in a tailspin.
- Oh, my God. A tailspin?


633
00:37:59.667 --> 00:38:01.543
She can't even say
she's depressed.


634
00:38:01.711 --> 00:38:04.546
She's gotta say something special.
Priss was honest.


635
00:38:04.714 --> 00:38:07.758
She was depressed
and she had a right to be in the show.


636
00:38:07.926 --> 00:38:10.469
Now every silly tail-spinner's
trying to get in.


637
00:38:10.637 --> 00:38:14.306
- The show is for everyone.
- No, it isn't, freak.


638
00:38:14.974 --> 00:38:18.310
To be in the center's programs,
you have to be clinically depressed.


639
00:38:18.478 --> 00:38:21.188
That means
that you've been to a clinic...


640
00:38:21.356 --> 00:38:23.524
And they've said
that you're depressed.


641
00:38:23.691 --> 00:38:25.567
Have you been to a clinic?

642
00:38:27.237 --> 00:38:30.614
Have you been to a clinic?
Then you're not clinically depressed.


643
00:38:39.749 --> 00:38:44.419
Violet. Violet. What is it?
Where are you going?


644
00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.301
All I wanted was to make Frank happy.
I had all these plans.


645
00:38:51.469 --> 00:38:55.806
Things we could've done together.
I never even got to tell him.


646
00:39:38.933 --> 00:39:42.728
Hey! Where all your boyfriends at?
Come on!


647
00:39:42.896 --> 00:39:45.939
They don't wear bikinis.
They're ladies, they wear thongs.


648
00:39:46.107 --> 00:39:48.233
I can't imagine
where she could've gone.


649
00:39:48.776 --> 00:39:51.820
Wherever she went,
she should be back by now.


650
00:39:52.322 --> 00:39:54.323
How did she seem
when you last saw her?


651
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:56.116
Really sad about Frank.

652
00:39:56.284 --> 00:39:57.784
- Still?
- Yeah.


653
00:39:57.952 --> 00:40:01.914
How can someone so smart continue
mooning over a dope like that?


654
00:40:02.081 --> 00:40:05.292
People aren't exactly as you assume.
The Violet you know...


655
00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.754
Bears little resemblance
to the girl I met in seventh grade.


656
00:40:08.922 --> 00:40:13.008
- You met Violet in seventh grade?
- Well, her name wasn't Violet then.


657
00:40:13.509 --> 00:40:15.636
What's your name?

658
00:40:15.803 --> 00:40:18.597
You can tell us your name.
We won't bite.


659
00:40:18.765 --> 00:40:21.558
What's your name? Tell us.

660
00:40:21.726 --> 00:40:25.062
Are you retarded?
Tell us your name.


661
00:40:26.105 --> 00:40:29.024
Emily tweeter.

662
00:40:29.192 --> 00:40:33.654
- Tweeter? Like a bird?
- That's ridiculous.


663
00:40:33.821 --> 00:40:37.449
Tweeter? Like a bird?

664
00:40:37.617 --> 00:40:41.328
- Not an easy name to have at that age.
- Not at any age.


665
00:40:41.496 --> 00:40:42.621
What was she like?

666
00:40:42.789 --> 00:40:45.457
Timid. Bookish.
Classic scholarship student.


667
00:40:45.625 --> 00:40:46.959
Her parents were writers.

668
00:40:47.126 --> 00:40:50.754
They didn't have a dime.
Finances were the least of her worries.


669
00:40:50.922 --> 00:40:53.966
- What do you mean?
- Well, she was crazy.


670
00:40:54.133 --> 00:40:57.344
I got stuck rooming with her
on a trip when no one else would.


671
00:40:57.512 --> 00:40:59.680
- It was awful.
- Did she smell bad?


672
00:40:59.847 --> 00:41:03.809
No. Obsessive cleanliness
was part of her insanity.


673
00:41:03.977 --> 00:41:05.477
- You were nice to her.
- No.


674
00:41:05.645 --> 00:41:08.522
The idea of being nice
to weird kids hadn't arrived.


675
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:11.984
- Why was she so unpopular?
- Well, she was very strange.


676
00:41:12.151 --> 00:41:15.362
Constantly setting herself odd,
repetitive tasks.


677
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:16.571
Tasks?

678
00:41:16.739 --> 00:41:22.119
For example, on that trip she had
with her a little square suitcase.


679
00:41:22.287 --> 00:41:24.830
The idea came into her head
she had to move it...


680
00:41:24.998 --> 00:41:27.374
In a precise pattern
over and over again...


681
00:41:27.542 --> 00:41:30.961
And if she didn't execute this
movement flawlessly 10 times...


682
00:41:31.129 --> 00:41:32.212
She'd start over.

683
00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:36.216
Another was to slide her hand
across her forehead...


684
00:41:36.384 --> 00:41:40.387
Trying not to touch her hair
or eyebrows on either side...


685
00:41:40.555 --> 00:41:42.806
Also repeating it 10 times.

686
00:41:42.974 --> 00:41:46.685
Any niggling thought she'd touched
the hair, she'd start over.


687
00:41:46.853 --> 00:41:50.188
- My God, that is insane.
- Why would she do that?


688
00:41:50.356 --> 00:41:54.318
She had the conviction that
if she didn't complete these tasks...


689
00:41:54.485 --> 00:41:56.069
Her parents would die.

690
00:41:56.237 --> 00:41:58.071
- Was she catholic?
- No.


691
00:41:58.239 --> 00:42:01.575
But what made the whole thing
really sad...


692
00:42:01.743 --> 00:42:04.036
Was that her parents did die.

693
00:42:04.203 --> 00:42:06.371
Oh, my God.

694
00:42:07.332 --> 00:42:08.932
Violet!

695
00:42:26.976 --> 00:42:28.226
Violet?

696
00:42:30.813 --> 00:42:33.732
Violet!

697
00:42:34.442 --> 00:42:37.194
Violet, where are you?

698
00:43:08.017 --> 00:43:12.354
Something's wrong, isn't it, dear?
You mind my asking?


699
00:43:12.522 --> 00:43:15.482
Well, I do mind a little.

700
00:43:16.192 --> 00:43:18.151
- Excuse me, your highness.
- I'm sorry.


701
00:43:18.319 --> 00:43:21.405
- It's just kind of awkward to talk about.
- No matter.


702
00:43:21.572 --> 00:43:24.449
I hope you haven't come
to get run over on the highway.


703
00:43:24.617 --> 00:43:26.952
- What do you mean?
- Suicides.


704
00:43:27.537 --> 00:43:30.497
They come down from the university.
Jump out in the road.


705
00:43:30.665 --> 00:43:32.332
Get hit by the blind curve.

706
00:43:33.209 --> 00:43:35.293
Hope you're not one of them.

707
00:43:35.461 --> 00:43:37.003
Do I look like one of them?

708
00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:40.340
I don't know.

709
00:43:40.508 --> 00:43:41.758
Maybe.

710
00:43:42.718 --> 00:43:44.219
Messy people, suicides.

711
00:43:44.387 --> 00:43:46.805
Think only of themselves
and their own deaths.


712
00:43:46.973 --> 00:43:48.348
Not what comes after.

713
00:43:48.516 --> 00:43:50.559
They leave quite a mess.

714
00:43:50.726 --> 00:43:53.019
They don't stick around
to clean it up.


715
00:43:56.649 --> 00:44:00.152
So you're not one of those depressed
students from the university?


716
00:44:00.319 --> 00:44:04.156
I don't like the word "depressed."
I prefer to say that I'm in a tailspin.


717
00:44:04.323 --> 00:44:05.490
A tailspin?

718
00:44:05.658 --> 00:44:09.119
- Does this tailspin involve a man?
- Yes, it does.


719
00:44:09.287 --> 00:44:11.830
But I'm not as crazy as I was
up till yesterday.


720
00:44:11.998 --> 00:44:16.168
Apparently that's due to the salutary
effect of scent on the human psyche.


721
00:44:16.335 --> 00:44:19.963
Its importance is, I believe,
almost incalculable.


722
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.258
At the motel,
I happened to use this soap.


723
00:44:23.426 --> 00:44:26.970
It was provided to me as a courtesy
as one of the guests.


724
00:44:27.138 --> 00:44:28.555
That an economical motel...

725
00:44:28.723 --> 00:44:31.850
Would provide such good soap
is quite unusual.


726
00:44:32.018 --> 00:44:35.145
- The scent is very precise.
- Really?


727
00:44:35.313 --> 00:44:38.815
Tell me if it provokes any particular
reaction in your psyche.


728
00:44:38.983 --> 00:44:41.151
A state of mind.

729
00:44:53.498 --> 00:44:55.415
I always knew she was unstable.

730
00:44:55.583 --> 00:44:58.585
They're gonna have her photo
at the registrar's.


731
00:45:20.316 --> 00:45:22.943
Violet! Violet!

732
00:45:23.110 --> 00:45:24.694
You're back! You're okay!

733
00:45:25.988 --> 00:45:27.572
Not really.

734
00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:29.950
Oh, my gosh, Violet,
we were so worried.


735
00:45:30.117 --> 00:45:32.202
Why didn't you tell us
or leave a note?


736
00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:34.454
I did leave a note.

737
00:45:34.622 --> 00:45:37.290
Would that be a suicide note?

738
00:45:44.423 --> 00:45:47.133
- I wouldn't leave without a note.
- Where did you go?


739
00:45:47.301 --> 00:45:50.637
I took the train to villafranca
and checked into a motel there.


740
00:45:50.805 --> 00:45:52.556
- The motel 6?
- No, the motel 4.


741
00:45:52.723 --> 00:45:55.976
- It's even less expensive.
- The motel 4 in villafranca?


742
00:45:56.602 --> 00:45:59.271
- My God, you really were suicidal.
- Why'd you go?


743
00:45:59.438 --> 00:46:00.772
I had to do something.

744
00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:05.610
And you really thought you were
gonna find the answer in villafranca?


745
00:46:05.778 --> 00:46:08.780
I'm not sure what I expected,
but I might have found it.


746
00:46:08.948 --> 00:46:10.448
What?

747
00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:15.412
Soap?

748
00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.166
This scent and this soap...

749
00:46:20.334 --> 00:46:22.877
Is what gives me hope.

750
00:46:34.974 --> 00:46:36.574
Hello?

751
00:46:40.896 --> 00:46:42.897
Ls anyone here?

752
00:46:44.191 --> 00:46:46.359
Hello?

753
00:46:48.279 --> 00:46:49.654
Lily?

754
00:46:49.822 --> 00:46:51.072
- Hello?
- Oh, my gosh.


755
00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.617
I couldn't understand
where everyone was.


756
00:46:54.577 --> 00:46:57.078
Sorry, I just went out
to get some things.


757
00:46:57.246 --> 00:46:59.164
- Where's Alice?
- Gone.


758
00:46:59.999 --> 00:47:01.499
What do you mean?

759
00:47:01.667 --> 00:47:03.084
Left.

760
00:47:03.502 --> 00:47:04.544
We broke up.

761
00:47:04.712 --> 00:47:07.922
- But when you called, you said...
- I know, I'm sorry.


762
00:47:08.883 --> 00:47:11.343
I thought it better
to tell you in person.


763
00:47:15.598 --> 00:47:19.768
Alice couldn't control her jealousy.
It completely overwhelmed her.


764
00:47:19.935 --> 00:47:22.437
Really? What was she jealous of?

765
00:47:22.605 --> 00:47:23.938
Come on.

766
00:47:24.106 --> 00:47:25.440
No, what?

767
00:47:25.608 --> 00:47:27.108
You.

768
00:47:27.276 --> 00:47:29.903
After a while,
I just couldn't handle it.


769
00:47:30.404 --> 00:47:32.781
Things became impossible.

770
00:47:33.783 --> 00:47:35.950
She was jealous of me?

771
00:47:36.786 --> 00:47:38.453
Of course.

772
00:47:42.124 --> 00:47:44.626
Would it be okay
if we watch a film?

773
00:47:44.794 --> 00:47:46.628
Yes.

774
00:47:46.796 --> 00:47:48.296
What would you like to see?

775
00:47:48.464 --> 00:47:52.300
I thought maybe Truffaut’s
baisers volés. Stolen kisses.


776
00:47:52.468 --> 00:47:53.802
Do you know it?

777
00:47:53.969 --> 00:47:55.553
No, is it new?

778
00:47:55.721 --> 00:47:57.847
It's a classic
of French new wave cinema.


779
00:47:58.015 --> 00:47:59.724
I think you'll like it.

780
00:47:59.892 --> 00:48:02.560
- But it's in color?
- Yeah.


781
00:48:03.646 --> 00:48:06.648
- You don't know truffaut?
- No.


782
00:48:07.483 --> 00:48:09.567
Do you know godard,
á bout de souffle?


783
00:48:28.504 --> 00:48:31.089
- Why was Alice so jealous?
- What do you think?


784
00:48:31.257 --> 00:48:33.425
She was jealous
because lily's lovely.


785
00:48:33.592 --> 00:48:35.844
I don't know.
They had a lot of problems.


786
00:48:36.011 --> 00:48:37.637
Of course.

787
00:48:37.805 --> 00:48:39.764
You wouldn't break up
a happy couple.


788
00:48:39.932 --> 00:48:42.100
- What's that?
- A note Frank left.


789
00:48:42.268 --> 00:48:44.978
- Really? Recently?
- No, when we were together.


790
00:48:45.146 --> 00:48:47.480
Now that most correspondence
is electronic...


791
00:48:47.648 --> 00:48:50.191
It's rare to be left anything
written by hand.


792
00:48:50.359 --> 00:48:51.609
Frank can write by hand?

793
00:48:52.361 --> 00:48:55.280
- What is it?
- It's not very important.


794
00:48:55.448 --> 00:48:57.115
It's just all I have.

795
00:48:57.283 --> 00:49:01.327
- What's it say?
- "Out for brewskis. Back in a gift."


796
00:49:01.495 --> 00:49:02.537
What's a "gift"?

797
00:49:02.705 --> 00:49:05.039
One of those little motor scooters,
isn't it?


798
00:49:05.207 --> 00:49:08.418
I'm sure he meant to write "jiff"
with a J. "Back in a jiff."


799
00:49:08.586 --> 00:49:09.753
But he wrote "gift."

800
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.423
- Could Frank be dyslexic?
- No. Dyslexics are intelligent.


801
00:49:15.384 --> 00:49:17.635
- What's that?
- Frank's bean ball.


802
00:49:17.803 --> 00:49:21.639
- He gave you his bean ball?
- Not exactly. This is an extra.


803
00:49:21.807 --> 00:49:25.643
He thought he'd leave it here
just in case he lost his other one.


804
00:49:25.811 --> 00:49:29.147
Gosh, Violet, you've really
gotta stop thinking about Frank.


805
00:49:29.315 --> 00:49:31.649
Why? I don't wanna stop
thinking about him.


806
00:49:32.401 --> 00:49:36.070
Recently I had a thought
that cheered me up a lot.


807
00:49:36.572 --> 00:49:38.823
Life is like a long, flowing river...

808
00:49:38.991 --> 00:49:43.286
And as a long, flowing river, some
debris you never expect to see again...


809
00:49:43.454 --> 00:49:46.414
Is almost certain to reappear
floating to the surface.


810
00:49:46.582 --> 00:49:49.793
Frank and I may very well
be together again one day.


811
00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.754
Maybe it'll take years,
but somewhere down the line...


812
00:49:52.922 --> 00:49:57.008
He's very likely to pop up again,
and I'll be there to catch him.


813
00:50:08.479 --> 00:50:11.022
I don't think
we've spoken about this.


814
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:12.190
What?

815
00:50:12.358 --> 00:50:16.152
Have you been to the south of France?
To the walled city of carcass?


816
00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.948
- I've never been anywhere.
- But you've seen pictures of it.


817
00:50:20.115 --> 00:50:22.325
No, I don't think so.

818
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:27.247
Oh, it's fascinating.

819
00:50:27.414 --> 00:50:31.167
- I'd like to visit.
- You never studied the catharsis?


820
00:50:35.047 --> 00:50:36.881
They were a religious movement...

821
00:50:37.049 --> 00:50:38.341
Very idealistic...

822
00:50:38.509 --> 00:50:40.927
Located mostly
in the southwest of France...


823
00:50:41.095 --> 00:50:43.221
That the catholic church
repressed.


824
00:50:43.389 --> 00:50:46.182
Oh, my God. The catholic church is,
like, always bad.


825
00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:49.018
Ideas can't be killed
as easily as people.


826
00:50:49.186 --> 00:50:51.938
Especially such enlightened ones
as the catharsis held.


827
00:50:52.106 --> 00:50:55.942
In recent years, more and more people
have returned to their beliefs.


828
00:50:56.402 --> 00:50:59.904
So you're a cathar?

829
00:51:00.072 --> 00:51:02.448
Yes. I aspire to be.

830
00:51:02.616 --> 00:51:06.619
I'm trying to follow the path
the catharsis marked out.


831
00:51:06.787 --> 00:51:09.080
That's so impressive.

832
00:51:09.248 --> 00:51:12.250
I can tell you we didn't have
any catharsis back home.


833
00:51:12.418 --> 00:51:14.919
I think you'd be surprised.

834
00:51:34.523 --> 00:51:35.732
In the cathar view...

835
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:39.819
The highest form of lovemaking
avoids procreation entirely.


836
00:51:39.987 --> 00:51:41.988
Sure. Condoms, right?

837
00:51:43.282 --> 00:51:45.074
Well, according to cathar ideas...

838
00:51:45.242 --> 00:51:49.621
Sex with condoms is just a parody
of the procreative act.


839
00:51:50.623 --> 00:51:51.789
What do you mean?

840
00:51:51.957 --> 00:51:55.043
The standard, cliché form
of sexual intercourse...


841
00:51:55.210 --> 00:51:58.296
Is for the man to approach
a woman from the front.


842
00:51:58.797 --> 00:52:01.674
Cathar lovemaking,
I think you'll find very fulfilling.


843
00:52:01.842 --> 00:52:04.677
I'll be very careful, we'll go slowly.

844
00:52:04.845 --> 00:52:06.346
It'll be a new experience...

845
00:52:06.513 --> 00:52:11.142
But one which I think you'll find
brings an inexpressible closeness.


846
00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.428
Might your drinks-buying friend
be around?


847
00:52:47.596 --> 00:52:50.223
It would be great
to get complimentary cocktails.


848
00:52:50.391 --> 00:52:52.684
- Charlie? No.
- Do you still see him at all?


849
00:52:52.851 --> 00:52:54.811
- He calls from time to time.
- He does?


850
00:52:54.979 --> 00:52:57.939
- Why don't you introduce us?
- Why should I introduce you?


851
00:52:58.107 --> 00:52:59.899
Because you know him,
and we don't.


852
00:53:00.067 --> 00:53:01.526
So?

853
00:53:01.694 --> 00:53:02.694
"So?"

854
00:53:03.362 --> 00:53:06.489
"So" is probably the unkindest word
in the English language.


855
00:53:06.657 --> 00:53:10.910
I can't bear it. I think it should
be outlawed. "So."


856
00:53:11.078 --> 00:53:12.328
You're crazy.

857
00:53:12.496 --> 00:53:14.372
Come on, lily, you have Xavier.

858
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:18.209
- You can't keep two guys for yourself.
- Guys do that all the time.


859
00:53:18.711 --> 00:53:20.211
We're not guys, fortunately.

860
00:53:20.379 --> 00:53:23.589
It's unconscionable for you not
to bring him and introduce us.


861
00:53:23.757 --> 00:53:27.051
Charlie is a friend. 
He's a nice guy.

862
00:53:27.219 --> 00:53:28.720
What do you mean?

863
00:53:28.887 --> 00:53:32.140
I hate to think what'd happen
if you got your claws into him.


864
00:53:32.307 --> 00:53:33.683
That's outrageous.

865
00:53:33.851 --> 00:53:34.934
We're perfectly nice.

866
00:53:35.102 --> 00:53:38.187
We've met lots of pathetic guys
and nothing bad's happened.


867
00:53:38.355 --> 00:53:41.190
- Charlie's not pathetic.
- Well, all the better, then.


868
00:53:52.619 --> 00:53:55.079
The roman holidays
will be coming soon.


869
00:53:55.247 --> 00:53:58.332
- What's that?
- A festival roman letter clubs put on.


870
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:00.501
A kind of moron jamboree.

871
00:54:00.669 --> 00:54:04.088
The roman elements are the worship
of bacchus, beerus and blotto.


872
00:54:04.256 --> 00:54:06.591
- It could've all been so uplifting.
- Charlie.


873
00:54:07.134 --> 00:54:09.093
Hey, Charlie.

874
00:54:09.261 --> 00:54:12.263
Hey. What are you doing here?

875
00:54:12.431 --> 00:54:15.641
- Have you the day off?
- Yeah.


876
00:54:17.186 --> 00:54:21.314
This is my friend Charlie,
whom I think I've mentioned.


877
00:54:21.482 --> 00:54:24.609
And, Charlie,
these are my roommates. This is...


878
00:54:24.985 --> 00:54:28.946
This is rose.
And this is Heather. And Violet.


879
00:54:29.406 --> 00:54:32.617
Charlie works
for strategic development associates.


880
00:54:32.785 --> 00:54:34.452
He's an associate there.

881
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.454
You work in strategic development?

882
00:54:36.622 --> 00:54:38.581
- You've heard of it?
- Of course, yes.


883
00:54:38.749 --> 00:54:42.126
My cousin Jay in Philadelphia works
in strategic development.


884
00:54:42.294 --> 00:54:44.003
Something business-related?

885
00:54:44.171 --> 00:54:47.131
Mostly business,
but any kind of organization.


886
00:54:47.299 --> 00:54:51.969
- Only businesses pay the big bucks.
- Nonprofits and government pay well.


887
00:54:52.137 --> 00:54:54.514
That's how they keep
from having profits...


888
00:54:54.681 --> 00:54:57.558
By paying lots of money
to companies like yours.


889
00:54:57.726 --> 00:55:02.105
Excuse me, but aren't you in professor
Ryan's course at the ed school?


890
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:04.273
No.

891
00:55:04.441 --> 00:55:07.193
You're not in professor Ryan's
flit lit course?


892
00:55:07.361 --> 00:55:08.653
No.

893
00:55:08.821 --> 00:55:12.115
- Flit lit?
- The dandy tradition in literature.


894
00:55:12.282 --> 00:55:14.784
- I'm sure I've seen you there.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.


895
00:55:14.952 --> 00:55:17.995
I'm not in any courses
at the ed school. Good to meet you.


896
00:55:18.163 --> 00:55:20.581
- It was great to see you.
- Bye.


897
00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.835
God, Violet, what was that about?

898
00:55:24.002 --> 00:55:26.546
That guy is definitely
in professor Ryan's class.


899
00:55:26.713 --> 00:55:30.550
Not possible. He has a full time job
for strategic development associates.


900
00:55:30.717 --> 00:55:32.009
He never got his coffee.

901
00:55:32.177 --> 00:55:36.013
- Why lie about something like that?
- He's lying.


902
00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:39.475
I find that very attractive.

903
00:55:39.643 --> 00:55:40.977
What are you going to do?

904
00:55:41.145 --> 00:55:43.980
I'm gonna stop cutting
professor Ryan's class.


905
00:55:48.152 --> 00:55:51.529
It can be argued that firbank
was too little disciplined...


906
00:55:51.697 --> 00:55:55.199
Too unserious
in his unseriousness...


907
00:55:55.367 --> 00:55:58.369
To create works of enduring value.

908
00:55:58.537 --> 00:56:02.165
But as a liberating influence
on later writers such as waugh...


909
00:56:02.332 --> 00:56:04.876
His importance
should not be discounted.


910
00:56:05.794 --> 00:56:09.213
It's not firbank's work itself
but the idea of his work...


911
00:56:09.381 --> 00:56:11.382
That so helped later writers...

912
00:56:11.550 --> 00:56:14.760
As Thomas love peacock
did in the previous century.


913
00:56:16.013 --> 00:56:18.222
I'm not gonna come anymore.

914
00:56:19.683 --> 00:56:22.059
- What a waste of time.
- Charlie.


915
00:56:22.227 --> 00:56:23.436
Charlie.

916
00:56:24.062 --> 00:56:26.480
- Charlie?
- Charlie, you are taking the course.


917
00:56:26.648 --> 00:56:27.899
Charlie?

918
00:56:28.066 --> 00:56:29.108
Who's Charlie?

919
00:56:29.276 --> 00:56:31.736
- Fred, what's going on?
- Fred?


920
00:56:31.904 --> 00:56:34.780
Fred. Sounds like you got
some explaining to do.


921
00:56:38.744 --> 00:56:41.913
- Well, you were lying.
- I wasn't lying, I was making it up.


922
00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.414
Why were you making it up?

923
00:56:43.582 --> 00:56:47.418
If you were an eighth-year ed school
student, would you advertise that?


924
00:56:47.586 --> 00:56:51.380
Eighth year. Impressive.
But your whole life was a lie.


925
00:56:51.548 --> 00:56:54.008
Dressing up in suits.
Buying people drinks.


926
00:56:54.176 --> 00:56:56.135
The suits were real.
The drinks, real.


927
00:56:56.303 --> 00:56:59.096
Not just drinks for people.
They were for cute girls.


928
00:56:59.264 --> 00:57:02.433
There's a perfectly rational,
easily explainable agenda.


929
00:57:02.601 --> 00:57:04.602
So it was a playboy
or operator move.


930
00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:09.273
- Of course. Transparently so.
- I admire that. Drinks are expensive.


931
00:57:09.441 --> 00:57:12.485
But strategic development,
that was made up too?


932
00:57:13.195 --> 00:57:16.239
- You said your cousin Jay was in it.
- What cousin Jay?


933
00:57:16.406 --> 00:57:19.450
- In Philadelphia.
- I don't have a cousin in Philadelphia.


934
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:23.579
You said your cousin Jay
was working in strategic development.


935
00:57:23.747 --> 00:57:27.625
I was just saying that to be friendly.
To make a kind of link.


936
00:57:28.794 --> 00:57:33.256
- So your name's Fred something?
- Yes. Fred something.


937
00:57:33.423 --> 00:57:36.676
- Packenstacker?
- Oh, my God. How crazy.


938
00:57:37.219 --> 00:57:40.388
He's completely insane.
I almost dated him.


939
00:57:40.555 --> 00:57:43.975
- You can say that about a lot of guys.
- I don't think he's crazy.


940
00:57:44.142 --> 00:57:47.812
Making up an entirely fictitious
identity, that's not crazy?


941
00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:52.525
- It's insane. It's psycho.
- Violet's identity is made up.


942
00:57:52.693 --> 00:57:55.361
- I don't think she's crazy.
- No, I am.


943
00:57:55.529 --> 00:57:57.029
No, this is different.

944
00:57:57.197 --> 00:58:01.117
It's crazy and pathetic.

945
00:58:01.285 --> 00:58:04.453
All that about strategic development
he just made up.


946
00:58:05.914 --> 00:58:07.832
Don't tell me that's not weird.

947
00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.001
I've heard of strategic development.

948
00:58:10.168 --> 00:58:12.503
I think it's something
pretty important.


949
00:58:12.921 --> 00:58:16.007
Violet, you're not gonna
start going out with him.


950
00:58:16.633 --> 00:58:18.092
You're not, are you?

951
00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:20.553
Well, we had planned
to go to the library.


952
00:58:20.721 --> 00:58:22.680
- Not to the stacks, I hope.
- Yes.


953
00:58:22.848 --> 00:58:25.599
Oh, my gosh, do you realize
how dangerous that is?


954
00:58:25.767 --> 00:58:27.226
- Dangerous?
- Yes, the stacks.


955
00:58:27.394 --> 00:58:30.146
They're dark and deserted.
Anything could happen.


956
00:58:30.314 --> 00:58:31.439
It's true.

957
00:58:31.606 --> 00:58:33.691
With the study habits
at seven oaks...


958
00:58:33.859 --> 00:58:36.027
Your body won't be found
until spring.


959
00:58:36.194 --> 00:58:39.697
Promise you won't go with him
to the stacks. Please.


960
00:58:40.991 --> 00:58:43.409
Okay. I'll suggest
the Randall room.


961
00:58:44.119 --> 00:58:47.538
- Don't suggest. Insist.
- And please not at night.


962
00:58:48.332 --> 00:58:49.874
Okay.

963
00:58:52.794 --> 00:58:54.462
What are you reading?

964
00:58:56.048 --> 00:58:59.383
Have you chosen a topic
for your final paper?


965
00:58:59.551 --> 00:59:01.719
The decline of decadence.

966
00:59:01.887 --> 00:59:04.221
You think that decadence
has declined?


967
00:59:04.389 --> 00:59:08.768
Definitely. Big time.
Major, major decline.


968
00:59:08.935 --> 00:59:10.311
How?

969
00:59:10.479 --> 00:59:12.521
How or in what ways?

970
00:59:14.191 --> 00:59:15.232
Either.

971
00:59:16.234 --> 00:59:20.237
Well, take the flit movement
in literature, or homosexuality.


972
00:59:20.405 --> 00:59:23.741
It's gone completely downhill,
right down the tubes.


973
00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:27.453
What do you mean?

974
00:59:27.621 --> 00:59:30.581
Before, homosexuality was
something refined, hidden...


975
00:59:30.749 --> 00:59:35.419
Aspiring to the highest levels
of creativity and often achieving it.


976
00:59:35.587 --> 00:59:39.340
Now it seems to be musclebound
morons running around in t-shirts.


977
00:59:39.508 --> 00:59:41.717
It's pretty disillusioning.

978
00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:45.513
Are you gay?

979
00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.683
Not especially, but in another era,
it might have had some appeal.


980
00:59:49.851 --> 00:59:54.647
- Now I just don't see the point.
- You might be romanticizing the past.


981
00:59:54.815 --> 00:59:58.818
We'll never know. The past is gone,
so we might as well romanticize it.


982
00:59:59.653 --> 01:00:00.778
You could be right.

983
01:00:00.946 --> 01:00:03.364
I wanted to ask, how's lily?

984
01:00:03.532 --> 01:00:04.782
Lily.

985
01:00:05.575 --> 01:00:07.284
She's okay.

986
01:00:20.006 --> 01:00:23.300
Here, check it out.
A.I.A. Nope. Hello. Good afternoon.


987
01:00:23.468 --> 01:00:26.971
Check it out. The a.I.A. Heard of it?
We have a meeting on Tuesday.


988
01:00:27.139 --> 01:00:29.932
- You should come by.
- What is the a.I.A.?


989
01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.561
Just join us. Come Tuesday.

990
01:00:33.979 --> 01:00:36.063
I think you'll really like it.

991
01:00:40.318 --> 01:00:42.319
So...

992
01:00:43.321 --> 01:00:47.450
A fellow was passing these out, and
invited us to a meeting on Tuesday.


993
01:00:50.787 --> 01:00:52.329
The a.I.A.?

994
01:00:52.497 --> 01:00:54.248
Oh, my God.

995
01:00:55.709 --> 01:00:58.169
I thought it was something related.

996
01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:00.296
No?

997
01:01:01.798 --> 01:01:04.216
The a.I.A. Has got
nothing to do with us.


998
01:01:04.384 --> 01:01:06.427
Can't you see that?

999
01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.098
The way we express love
has meaning.


1000
01:01:11.266 --> 01:01:13.517
It's in the context
of something beautiful.


1001
01:01:13.685 --> 01:01:17.021
We're following our creator's
teaching. Aspiring to an ideal.


1002
01:01:17.189 --> 01:01:20.191
A beautiful one that brings
an inexpressible closeness.


1003
01:01:20.358 --> 01:01:22.693
Not just to each other, but...

1004
01:01:23.737 --> 01:01:26.572
For the a.I.A.,
and those like them...


1005
01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:29.533
The love act
is just hedonistic pleasure-seeking...


1006
01:01:29.701 --> 01:01:31.702
Of a perverted nature.

1007
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:35.206
I can't believe you'd think we had
anything in common with them.


1008
01:01:35.373 --> 01:01:36.624
We don't.

1009
01:01:36.791 --> 01:01:39.210
Nothing, not an iota.

1010
01:01:39.377 --> 01:01:41.420
My God, can't you see that?

1011
01:01:44.883 --> 01:01:47.384
Lily. Lily, come back.

1012
01:01:47.552 --> 01:01:50.763
Please. Don't be that way.

1013
01:02:44.192 --> 01:02:47.945
- Oh, my gosh, lily. Are you okay?
- It's all right.


1014
01:02:48.113 --> 01:02:50.698
You don't wanna talk about it?

1015
01:02:51.783 --> 01:02:52.866
I don't understand.

1016
01:02:53.034 --> 01:02:57.162
- You don't understand what?
- What is non-procreative lovemaking?


1017
01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:00.124
- It could be a lot of things.
- Yeah, but in this case?


1018
01:03:00.292 --> 01:03:02.835
- We don't have to talk about this.
- I don't mind.


1019
01:03:03.003 --> 01:03:05.212
Could somebody explain
what this is about?


1020
01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.505
Well, if...

1021
01:03:06.673 --> 01:03:09.008
Catharsis don't believe
in procreative sex.


1022
01:03:09.175 --> 01:03:11.427
They don't have intercourse
the usual way.


1023
01:03:11.595 --> 01:03:12.928
The usual way?

1024
01:03:13.096 --> 01:03:15.764
- You don't have to talk about this.
- No, it's okay.


1025
01:03:15.932 --> 01:03:19.518
It's the normal way, from the front
where you can have procreation...


1026
01:03:19.686 --> 01:03:23.147
Not from the other side,
where you can't.


1027
01:03:23.315 --> 01:03:26.150
The other side?
That's their religion?


1028
01:03:26.318 --> 01:03:28.902
No, but it's the direction
their beliefs head in.


1029
01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:31.322
When they express love,
that's what they do.


1030
01:03:32.949 --> 01:03:34.575
How horrible.

1031
01:03:34.868 --> 01:03:36.118
You poor girl.

1032
01:03:36.286 --> 01:03:37.578
What?

1033
01:03:37.746 --> 01:03:39.079
That's terrible...

1034
01:03:39.247 --> 01:03:41.999
What he obliged lily to do.

1035
01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:05.272
Violet.

1036
01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.107
Can we talk?

1037
01:04:16.451 --> 01:04:19.078
You must be pretty mad at me.

1038
01:04:19.245 --> 01:04:20.704
No.

1039
01:04:21.665 --> 01:04:22.873
You're not?

1040
01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:25.209
Not really.

1041
01:04:26.002 --> 01:04:28.420
But it was so terrible
how everything happened.


1042
01:04:28.588 --> 01:04:30.422
Your walking in on us.

1043
01:04:30.924 --> 01:04:33.050
Maybe it's easier that way.

1044
01:04:33.218 --> 01:04:34.760
That bitch!

1045
01:04:39.683 --> 01:04:43.352
I can't believe it. What a bitch.

1046
01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:45.729
- Priss?
- Of course priss.


1047
01:04:46.398 --> 01:04:50.651
"I'm so stressed. Sad. Depressed.

1048
01:04:50.819 --> 01:04:54.738
I'm so tired. I'm fatigued."

1049
01:04:55.824 --> 01:04:57.032
She was so depressed...

1050
01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.577
She had to get everything
her own way.


1051
01:05:00.745 --> 01:05:04.039
"I'm so stressed.

1052
01:05:05.417 --> 01:05:06.959
Frantic."

1053
01:05:07.127 --> 01:05:08.669
Man.

1054
01:05:08.837 --> 01:05:11.880
What a bitch.

1055
01:05:12.048 --> 01:05:14.258
Priss dumped you?

1056
01:05:14.426 --> 01:05:16.927
No. It was mutual.

1057
01:05:17.554 --> 01:05:21.140
Oh, listen, I have a question.

1058
01:05:21.307 --> 01:05:24.893
You remember that bean ball
that I left in your room?


1059
01:05:25.061 --> 01:05:26.520
Yeah.

1060
01:05:26.688 --> 01:05:27.813
Do you still have it?

1061
01:05:28.690 --> 01:05:30.274
Yeah.

1062
01:05:31.276 --> 01:05:33.277
Do you think I could get it back?

1063
01:05:33.445 --> 01:05:37.197
I lost the other one,
and with everything that's happened...


1064
01:05:37.365 --> 01:05:39.116
I'd really like to have it.

1065
01:05:39.534 --> 01:05:42.077
Nothing like some bean ball
after a breakup.


1066
01:05:42.245 --> 01:05:46.123
Yeah. God, you're smart.

1067
01:05:46.291 --> 01:05:48.292
You always get it.

1068
01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:52.671
Whatever I say...
...You understand.


1069
01:05:52.839 --> 01:05:54.798
Man.

1070
01:06:04.434 --> 01:06:06.226
Hey, Heather.

1071
01:06:06.394 --> 01:06:07.644
- Hey.
- Hey.


1072
01:06:07.812 --> 01:06:09.412
Hey.

1073
01:06:43.598 --> 01:06:45.182
Violet.

1074
01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:46.809
Violet, what's wrong?

1075
01:06:46.976 --> 01:06:48.811
I'm sorry. Lily's lovely.

1076
01:06:49.521 --> 01:06:52.564
Now she's free. Go. I understand.

1077
01:07:09.999 --> 01:07:13.085
Latin! Et cetera!

1078
01:07:25.056 --> 01:07:27.474
- Yeah!
- Yeah!


1079
01:07:32.939 --> 01:07:36.066
This is what comes
from not teaching Latin in the schools.


1080
01:07:36.234 --> 01:07:40.195
Yeah, it's moronic and boorish, but
it's also kind of fun, don't you think?


1081
01:07:40.363 --> 01:07:41.905
No.

1082
01:07:59.382 --> 01:08:00.883
What's that stench?

1083
01:08:09.601 --> 01:08:13.395
I suppose this is what happens when
decadence rots society from within.


1084
01:08:13.563 --> 01:08:15.105
And from without.

1085
01:08:15.273 --> 01:08:17.357
Such a society is, I fear...

1086
01:08:17.525 --> 01:08:20.777
Destined to fail and be overrun.

1087
01:08:20.945 --> 01:08:22.821
Maybe that's good.

1088
01:08:34.167 --> 01:08:37.753
Finally. It's about time those cesspools
were drained.


1089
01:08:49.307 --> 01:08:51.516
What color would you say
that chair is?


1090
01:08:51.684 --> 01:08:53.185
That's a chair?

1091
01:08:53.353 --> 01:08:55.312
I have no idea.

1092
01:08:56.981 --> 01:08:59.775
- Guys have preferences.
- You're going to accept that?


1093
01:08:59.943 --> 01:09:03.153
- You're not going to do anything?
- There's nothing to be done.


1094
01:09:03.321 --> 01:09:05.906
- Fred must know his own mind.
- Oh, really?


1095
01:09:06.074 --> 01:09:07.866
- I seriously doubt that.
- Come on.


1096
01:09:08.034 --> 01:09:10.827
Lily's got that slender,
delicately swelling beauty...


1097
01:09:10.995 --> 01:09:14.081
- ...that no man can resist.
- Okay, you're probably right.


1098
01:09:14.248 --> 01:09:17.668
Poor lily. Just think of all Xavier
put her through.


1099
01:09:19.462 --> 01:09:23.465
He just used her body.
And not even the right side.


1100
01:09:24.342 --> 01:09:27.928
Have you noticed that good people
tend to have large posteriors?


1101
01:09:28.096 --> 01:09:30.806
Not everyone, by any means.
I know it's not logical.


1102
01:09:30.974 --> 01:09:32.516
But it does seem to be true.

1103
01:09:32.684 --> 01:09:36.645
The genetic link between morality
and large posteriors?


1104
01:09:36.813 --> 01:09:38.563
Yes, I think that's well known.

1105
01:09:38.731 --> 01:09:41.441
You and Violet have that build.
It's nice.


1106
01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:45.278
You're still very attractive,
but also sensible and moralistic.


1107
01:09:45.446 --> 01:09:50.200
I don't. I have narrow hips,
but also no very strong principles.


1108
01:09:54.205 --> 01:09:55.372
Yes?

1109
01:09:58.584 --> 01:10:00.419
Oh, hi.

1110
01:10:00.586 --> 01:10:03.171
- Hi, Frank.
- Hey, Heather.


1111
01:10:04.048 --> 01:10:06.049
So I guess you guys all heard.

1112
01:10:06.217 --> 01:10:08.719
University's closing
all the roman letter houses.


1113
01:10:08.886 --> 01:10:12.764
Sorry. This year's roman holidays
did seem like the end of civilization...


1114
01:10:12.932 --> 01:10:16.852
But when civilization ends people
are going to need a place to stay.


1115
01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.895
Man.

1116
01:10:19.063 --> 01:10:20.564
It's bad.

1117
01:10:20.732 --> 01:10:22.774
It's that bastard
from the complainer.


1118
01:10:22.942 --> 01:10:25.569
Someone from the administration's
been reading it.


1119
01:10:25.737 --> 01:10:27.571
Hard to believe.

1120
01:10:27.739 --> 01:10:28.947
Bastard.

1121
01:10:31.534 --> 01:10:33.118
Listen...

1122
01:10:34.412 --> 01:10:36.747
We were wondering...

1123
01:10:36.914 --> 01:10:41.251
If you thought it would be okay
if we stayed at the suicide center.


1124
01:10:42.462 --> 01:10:45.922
Okay, sure. That sounds like
a good stopgap measure.


1125
01:10:46.090 --> 01:10:48.467
Thank you. Thank you.

1126
01:10:51.179 --> 01:10:53.555
So there's one more thing.

1127
01:10:54.098 --> 01:10:56.141
Remember that bean ball
we talked about?


1128
01:10:56.309 --> 01:10:57.768
Yes.

1129
01:10:57.977 --> 01:11:00.312
You think I could pick that up?

1130
01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.899
Just after everything
that's happened, it...


1131
01:11:04.067 --> 01:11:06.860
I could really use it right now.

1132
01:11:07.028 --> 01:11:08.278
Yes.

1133
01:11:15.244 --> 01:11:16.953
- What's that?
- What?


1134
01:11:17.121 --> 01:11:18.288
The note.

1135
01:11:18.456 --> 01:11:21.917
One gets so few things written
by hand anymore, I guess I kept it.


1136
01:11:22.502 --> 01:11:25.879
"Out for brewskis, back in a gift."

1137
01:11:26.047 --> 01:11:27.798
What's a gift?

1138
01:11:27.965 --> 01:11:30.175
It's the scooter.
Like a Vespa, right?


1139
01:11:30.343 --> 01:11:33.470
- That's what I thought.
- I was thinking about getting one.


1140
01:11:33.638 --> 01:11:36.765
You must've meant "jiff."
"Back in a jiff."


1141
01:11:36.933 --> 01:11:41.728
And then misspelled it,
or spelled it in a nonstandard way.


1142
01:11:42.563 --> 01:11:44.856
Yeah. Not a good speller.

1143
01:11:53.032 --> 01:11:54.491
Thanks.

1144
01:11:54.951 --> 01:11:58.995
You're great.
Priss was such a bitch.


1145
01:11:59.163 --> 01:12:02.916
Damn.

1146
01:12:06.671 --> 01:12:07.796
Hey, Heather.

1147
01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:16.763
Bye.

1148
01:12:17.682 --> 01:12:19.641
- Bye.
- Bye.


1149
01:12:24.522 --> 01:12:27.524
Heather is really cute.

1150
01:12:28.109 --> 01:12:31.278
She going out with anyone?

1151
01:12:31.445 --> 01:12:33.864
There might be something
between her and Thor.


1152
01:12:34.031 --> 01:12:35.782
Thor?

1153
01:12:36.784 --> 01:12:39.536
Damn. Heather and Thor?

1154
01:12:41.497 --> 01:12:43.206
Damn.

1155
01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:49.963
I'm worried about Thor.
It's hard for us to imagine...


1156
01:12:50.131 --> 01:12:52.549
How upsetting it is
not knowing the colors.


1157
01:12:52.717 --> 01:12:54.759
It's impossible for me to imagine.

1158
01:12:54.927 --> 01:12:57.971
When Thor sees a rainbow,
it's so much gibberish to him.


1159
01:12:58.139 --> 01:13:01.349
There was one this afternoon.
Oh, my gosh, he took it hard.


1160
01:13:01.517 --> 01:13:03.727
Recently, there was a parade
in the city...


1161
01:13:03.895 --> 01:13:07.230
Where the marchers carried
rainbow-colored flags and banners.


1162
01:13:07.398 --> 01:13:09.900
Thor was so upset.
He had no idea what it meant.


1163
01:13:10.067 --> 01:13:11.568
What kind of retard is he?

1164
01:13:11.736 --> 01:13:14.029
See, that's the conclusion
people jump to.


1165
01:13:14.197 --> 01:13:17.908
- Well, it is somewhat understandable.
- Not if you knew the full story.


1166
01:13:18.075 --> 01:13:19.242
What's the full story?

1167
01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.453
You know how parents
love bragging...


1168
01:13:21.621 --> 01:13:24.289
About how precocious
their children are?


1169
01:13:24.457 --> 01:13:26.875
Thor's parents
had become precocity addicts...


1170
01:13:27.043 --> 01:13:30.086
Constantly needing
an ever-greater precocity fix.


1171
01:13:30.254 --> 01:13:33.840
He should've entered kindergarten.
They pushed him into first grade.


1172
01:13:34.008 --> 01:13:36.176
"Thor skipped a grade,"
they could tell.


1173
01:13:36.344 --> 01:13:40.222
What Thor's parents failed to consider
is the work done in nursery school.


1174
01:13:40.389 --> 01:13:43.600
Key being the study of colors.
I suppose they just assumed...


1175
01:13:43.768 --> 01:13:46.269
That colors are knowledge
people pick up.


1176
01:13:46.437 --> 01:13:49.898
Like, for example,
not stepping on sidewalk cracks.


1177
01:13:50.066 --> 01:13:51.942
What's that?

1178
01:13:52.109 --> 01:13:54.069
I think rose is sleeping.

1179
01:13:55.613 --> 01:13:57.113
Am I boring?

1180
01:13:57.281 --> 01:13:58.740
No, not at all.

1181
01:13:59.242 --> 01:14:03.119
When you have problems, it's great
to hear someone else's idiotic ones.


1182
01:14:03.287 --> 01:14:05.121
Please go on.

1183
01:14:07.458 --> 01:14:08.959
- What?
- What you said about...


1184
01:14:09.126 --> 01:14:11.795
Depressed people being mean,
you weren't joking.


1185
01:14:11.963 --> 01:14:14.589
I'm sorry, you're right. Please go on.

1186
01:14:15.424 --> 01:14:16.841
No.

1187
01:14:17.009 --> 01:14:21.137
I'm sorry. You know how I am.
Please continue.


1188
01:14:23.975 --> 01:14:26.810
Thor decided he absolutely
had to learn all the colors.


1189
01:14:26.978 --> 01:14:28.937
Both primary and mixed.

1190
01:14:29.105 --> 01:14:32.691
He's been hitting the books hard,
and thought he'd mastered them.


1191
01:14:32.858 --> 01:14:35.568
Then, in town, he said,
"that traffic light's blue."


1192
01:14:35.736 --> 01:14:37.737
I had to say, "no, it's green."

1193
01:14:37.905 --> 01:14:38.989
He was really upset.

1194
01:14:39.156 --> 01:14:40.323
Oh, hi, lily.

1195
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:42.033
Hi.

1196
01:14:42.201 --> 01:14:44.119
We were worried about you.

1197
01:14:47.498 --> 01:14:49.833
I can't bear this tension with lily.

1198
01:14:50.001 --> 01:14:52.502
It's terrible to have the group
divided this way.


1199
01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:54.212
Better not next to robertson.

1200
01:14:55.631 --> 01:14:57.048
What?

1201
01:14:57.216 --> 01:14:59.009
Didn't you hear?

1202
01:14:59.176 --> 01:15:01.511
Ed students have been going
up to the roof...


1203
01:15:01.679 --> 01:15:04.014
And throwing themselves off.

1204
01:15:05.391 --> 01:15:07.809
- But it's only two stories.
- Yes, I know.


1205
01:15:07.977 --> 01:15:11.313
It's terrible. Not high enough to kill,
but high enough to maim.


1206
01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:14.190
And particularly dangerous
for anyone below.


1207
01:15:14.358 --> 01:15:16.860
I've got to forget about Fred.

1208
01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:18.737
But you really liked him.

1209
01:15:18.904 --> 01:15:24.075
This whole thing of a person meeting
someone else first, it's so arbitrary.


1210
01:15:24.243 --> 01:15:29.372
- It's terrible and cruel.
- I have to say, I was wrong about Fred.


1211
01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.958
I thought he was a playboy
or operator type.


1212
01:15:32.126 --> 01:15:34.794
In fact, he's just another guy
rendered helpless...


1213
01:15:34.962 --> 01:15:40.050
- ...by the attentions of a pretty girl.
- Cary! No, don't! I love you!


1214
01:15:40.217 --> 01:15:42.385
- Why did you do that?
- Oh, my God!


1215
01:15:42.553 --> 01:15:44.554
Cary, I love you!

1216
01:15:46.307 --> 01:15:49.267
Isn't the ed school
essentially a teacher's college?


1217
01:15:49.435 --> 01:15:50.560
Yeah.

1218
01:15:50.728 --> 01:15:53.188
If they can't even
destroy themselves...


1219
01:15:53.356 --> 01:15:56.399
How are they going to teach
America's youth?


1220
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:29.432
- What do you think you're doing?
- Sorry. Did I disturb you?


1221
01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:32.310
Why are you wearing tap shoes?
You out of your mind?


1222
01:16:32.645 --> 01:16:35.605
- I think that's pretty clear.
- I'm so sick of that.


1223
01:16:35.773 --> 01:16:37.399
Oh, really? I think it's cute.

1224
01:16:37.566 --> 01:16:41.861
Since you won't be treating us to
one of your incompetent tap routines...


1225
01:16:42.029 --> 01:16:45.949
- ...why don't you take those things off?
- No. We'll do the routine. Rose.


1226
01:16:46.117 --> 01:16:49.619
- Madge wants to see the routine.
- I don't want to see your routine.


1227
01:16:49.787 --> 01:16:52.330
- I asked you to take those off.
- We need a break.


1228
01:16:52.498 --> 01:16:53.623
Just briefly, please.

1229
01:16:53.791 --> 01:16:56.668
It's helpful to have an audience.
Rose, the music.


1230
01:16:56.836 --> 01:16:58.545
I'm gonna report you.

1231
01:17:26.657 --> 01:17:28.283
Suzanne.

1232
01:17:28.451 --> 01:17:32.829
For me, it'd be madame curie,
Simone de beauvoir...


1233
01:17:32.997 --> 01:17:35.498
- ...and Margaret sanger.
- Good.


1234
01:17:36.417 --> 01:17:37.709
Violet.

1235
01:17:37.877 --> 01:17:39.794
I would say...

1236
01:17:40.546 --> 01:17:42.714
Richard Strauss,
roderick Charleston...


1237
01:17:42.882 --> 01:17:44.716
And chubbard checker.

1238
01:17:44.884 --> 01:17:49.179
- Richard Strauss? The composer?
- Yes, that was one of his posts.


1239
01:17:49.346 --> 01:17:52.765
I'm not familiar with the others.
Could you tell us who they are?


1240
01:17:52.933 --> 01:17:56.269
Yes. Each one of these men
started an international dance craze.


1241
01:17:56.437 --> 01:17:59.772
Richard Strauss, the waltz.
Roderick Charleston, the Charleston.


1242
01:17:59.940 --> 01:18:01.858
Chubbard checker,
known as chubby...


1243
01:18:02.026 --> 01:18:03.818
The dance we know as the twist.

1244
01:18:03.986 --> 01:18:06.237
Why do you consider
a dance craze important?


1245
01:18:06.405 --> 01:18:09.741
Dance crazes enhance
and elevate the human experience...


1246
01:18:09.909 --> 01:18:12.076
Bringing together
millions of people...


1247
01:18:12.244 --> 01:18:15.205
In a joyous celebration
of our God-given faculties...


1248
01:18:15.372 --> 01:18:18.041
And passing these modes
of physical expression...


1249
01:18:18.209 --> 01:18:21.544
Down through the generations.
Though not so much anymore.


1250
01:18:21.712 --> 01:18:24.339
I thought...
Well, I assumed that the Charleston...


1251
01:18:24.507 --> 01:18:26.966
Was named after
the city of Charleston.


1252
01:18:27.134 --> 01:18:30.094
No. Though that misconception
is quite widely held.


1253
01:18:30.262 --> 01:18:32.430
It was roderick Charleston.

1254
01:18:32.598 --> 01:18:35.642
Usually, behind some
great creative phenomenon...


1255
01:18:35.809 --> 01:18:38.228
There's a person, not a town.

1256
01:18:38.395 --> 01:18:41.314
This is so exciting.
It's really great, isn't it?


1257
01:18:41.482 --> 01:18:43.900
- Hey, could you guys help?
- Sure. What's up?


1258
01:18:44.068 --> 01:18:45.568
We need help packing soap...

1259
01:18:45.736 --> 01:18:48.279
Which we'll distribute
to doar dorm residents.


1260
01:18:48.447 --> 01:18:49.614
Cool.

1261
01:18:49.782 --> 01:18:52.992
What would you say are effective
means to fight depression?


1262
01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.538
Maybe some of your du brothers
have an idea?


1263
01:18:58.999 --> 01:19:01.918
- Beer?
- No. Beer's a downer.


1264
01:19:02.086 --> 01:19:06.172
Cocktails. Hard liquor and spirits
is what really gives you a lift.


1265
01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.924
It's interesting what you say.

1266
01:19:08.092 --> 01:19:11.594
My cousin Jay is a medical officer
in Philadelphia.


1267
01:19:11.762 --> 01:19:13.096
He says that alcoholism...

1268
01:19:13.264 --> 01:19:16.599
By which I mean chronic,
excessive consumption of alcohol...


1269
01:19:16.767 --> 01:19:19.978
Is the primary self-administered
treatment for depression.


1270
01:19:20.145 --> 01:19:21.437
- Cool.
- No.


1271
01:19:21.605 --> 01:19:23.982
It leaves you much worse off
than before.


1272
01:19:24.149 --> 01:19:26.859
Oh, no, not me.
I just boot and then I feel fine.


1273
01:19:27.027 --> 01:19:31.239
- By "boot" do you mean vomit?
- Yes.


1274
01:19:31.407 --> 01:19:35.785
No. None of the effective anti-suicide
treatments involve vomiting.


1275
01:19:37.079 --> 01:19:39.455
- Hygiene?
- Exactly.


1276
01:19:39.623 --> 01:19:40.915
It's very important.

1277
01:19:41.083 --> 01:19:43.501
That's why we have such hope
in the wonder bar.


1278
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:45.336
Do you know its scent?

1279
01:19:51.093 --> 01:19:53.970
Trans-formative, we think.

1280
01:19:56.015 --> 01:19:59.017
This is so exciting.
When should we go over there?


1281
01:19:59.184 --> 01:20:01.978
- I don't think there's any rush.
- I'd like to go soon.


1282
01:20:02.146 --> 01:20:06.149
Doar dorm has the highest fatality
rate, as well as the worst hygiene.


1283
01:20:06.317 --> 01:20:07.400
Highest suicide rate.

1284
01:20:07.568 --> 01:20:10.987
Fatality rate. It's uncertain
what percentage were intentional...


1285
01:20:11.155 --> 01:20:14.449
And how many were just due
to unawareness of gravity's laws.


1286
01:20:14.617 --> 01:20:18.328
I can just see those guys getting
the gold packages, opening them...


1287
01:20:18.495 --> 01:20:20.830
And finding
the good-smelling soap inside.


1288
01:20:20.998 --> 01:20:23.333
The cute packaging
should prove irresistible.


1289
01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:26.753
And once clean, they'll start
to see the world with new eyes.


1290
01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.463
The change could be dramatic.

1291
01:20:28.631 --> 01:20:31.633
Doar dorm
could soon become dior dorm.


1292
01:20:32.426 --> 01:20:35.261
I doubt that,
to be perfectly, absolutely honest.


1293
01:20:35.429 --> 01:20:38.097
I love the idea. Dior dorm.

1294
01:20:38.265 --> 01:20:40.975
I adore optimism,
even when it's completely absurd.


1295
01:20:41.143 --> 01:20:44.687
- Perhaps especially then.
- Great. Ready? Let's go.


1296
01:20:46.815 --> 01:20:48.316
Let's hurry.

1297
01:20:48.484 --> 01:20:50.985
Let's not get our hopes up too high,
Heather.


1298
01:20:51.153 --> 01:20:55.114
No, you said yourself,
the wonder bar is trans-formative.


1299
01:20:55.282 --> 01:20:57.533
- Hey, Violet. Hi.
- Hi.


1300
01:20:57.701 --> 01:20:59.619
- Where you going?
- Doar dorm.


1301
01:20:59.787 --> 01:21:02.622
- Fred, hi.
- Hey.


1302
01:21:06.835 --> 01:21:08.378
Good one.

1303
01:21:09.338 --> 01:21:11.047
Oh, no.

1304
01:21:22.184 --> 01:21:24.060
Oh, my God.

1305
01:21:24.228 --> 01:21:27.563
I guess it wasn't realistic
to expect doar dorm...


1306
01:21:27.731 --> 01:21:30.066
To turn into dior dorm overnight.

1307
01:21:30.234 --> 01:21:31.776
They wouldn't even open them.

1308
01:21:31.944 --> 01:21:35.571
They said without the soap,
the discs wouldn't fly properly.


1309
01:21:35.739 --> 01:21:39.409
Are you coming Friday?
Violet's launching her dance craze.


1310
01:21:39.576 --> 01:21:41.035
Oh, really? That's great.

1311
01:21:41.203 --> 01:21:43.204
- What's the dance?
- The sambola.


1312
01:21:43.372 --> 01:21:44.747
The devil's dance.

1313
01:21:44.915 --> 01:21:48.626
- Oh, cool. We'll go, right?
- Yes, I'd like to.


1314
01:21:48.794 --> 01:21:53.256
But I have several papers to finish.
But I'd like to.


1315
01:22:12.025 --> 01:22:14.694
Great. Thanks, gus.

1316
01:22:14.862 --> 01:22:19.449
I don't see how we're going to start
a dance craze if no guys show up.


1317
01:22:19.908 --> 01:22:22.702
Most guys aren't very good
with the dance-craze thing.


1318
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:25.955
Very good news. I was just
in my procrastination seminar...


1319
01:22:26.123 --> 01:22:29.250
And the two guys
from doar dorm had showered.


1320
01:22:29.418 --> 01:22:32.628
It was clear they'd used soap.
Oh, my gosh, what a difference.


1321
01:22:32.796 --> 01:22:36.924
Seems they'd been throwing packages
so energetically, a soap bar fell out.


1322
01:22:37.092 --> 01:22:39.719
The unfamiliar ivory-like object
intrigued them...


1323
01:22:39.887 --> 01:22:42.346
And one thing
led to another, and, well...


1324
01:22:42.514 --> 01:22:44.682
It was just as you said.
Isn't that great?


1325
01:22:44.850 --> 01:22:47.935
- Oh, look, here's jimbo.
- Jimbo doesn't count.


1326
01:22:49.813 --> 01:22:51.647
Where is everybody?

1327
01:23:00.365 --> 01:23:03.409
Aren't we gonna be late
for Violet's dance craze?


1328
01:23:03.577 --> 01:23:04.702
You wanna go to that?

1329
01:23:05.329 --> 01:23:06.621
Yeah.

1330
01:23:06.789 --> 01:23:09.999
- You're kidding.
- No, I love dance crazes.


1331
01:23:11.251 --> 01:23:12.627
Gosh, you're strange.

1332
01:23:13.337 --> 01:23:15.087
But aren't we already late?

1333
01:23:15.255 --> 01:23:17.465
No, it's later on. Like 10, I think.

1334
01:23:18.509 --> 01:23:22.136
I have to confess, I've started
losing patience with Violet.


1335
01:23:22.304 --> 01:23:25.431
Depression calls
for serious treatment.


1336
01:23:25.599 --> 01:23:28.601
Medication.
Psycho-pharmaceuticals.


1337
01:23:28.769 --> 01:23:30.144
Talk therapy.

1338
01:23:30.312 --> 01:23:33.940
Are those approaches effective?
Despite the medication and therapy...


1339
01:23:34.107 --> 01:23:38.361
Ed school students are still throwing
themselves off robertson hall.


1340
01:23:38.529 --> 01:23:41.322
Violet's ideas
might seem a little offbeat...


1341
01:23:41.490 --> 01:23:45.701
A little? Oh, my God. I don't know
how much you know about Violet...


1342
01:23:45.869 --> 01:23:48.037
But there's some
pretty weird stuff.


1343
01:23:48.205 --> 01:23:50.206
You know, Violet. 
Violet Wister.

1344
01:23:50.374 --> 01:23:52.083
It's not even her real name.

1345
01:23:52.251 --> 01:23:54.544
- It isn't?
- No, it's Emily tweeter.


1346
01:23:55.128 --> 01:23:57.713
When she was 11,
she went completely crazy...


1347
01:23:57.881 --> 01:24:00.508
And has had several
relapses since.


1348
01:24:00.676 --> 01:24:05.304
So it's a little worrisome to have her
counsel nearly suicidal individuals.


1349
01:24:05.472 --> 01:24:07.306
I can't believe it.

1350
01:24:07.474 --> 01:24:10.268
- What?
- Emily tweeter.


1351
01:24:10.435 --> 01:24:13.896
In first grade, I had an enormous crush
on a girl with that name.


1352
01:24:14.857 --> 01:24:17.275
- And you remember that?
- Yeah.


1353
01:24:18.527 --> 01:24:20.528
Pretty huge Dr. zhivago stuff.

1354
01:24:20.696 --> 01:24:23.781
Any idea or even mention of her
filled me with emotion.


1355
01:24:23.949 --> 01:24:26.075
I had a strange perspective
on the world.


1356
01:24:26.243 --> 01:24:28.870
I don't think my brain
was functioning properly.


1357
01:24:29.037 --> 01:24:31.289
Everything was a bit of a dream.

1358
01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:33.749
You think this was Violet?

1359
01:24:33.917 --> 01:24:37.003
You have any idea if Violet
attended willamette montessori?


1360
01:24:37.170 --> 01:24:38.880
In Portland?

1361
01:24:39.464 --> 01:24:43.217
- We didn't order these.
- Compliments of the guy at the bar.


1362
01:24:53.604 --> 01:24:56.439
It was so brutal
how it ended between us.


1363
01:24:57.316 --> 01:24:59.609
I know I was too angry
and a bit crazy...


1364
01:24:59.776 --> 01:25:03.029
But I thought that what we had
was stronger than that.


1365
01:25:03.196 --> 01:25:06.782
That you would not just walk away
after one disagreement.


1366
01:25:08.035 --> 01:25:10.411
It wasn't just that.

1367
01:25:10.829 --> 01:25:13.456
You mean my cathar beliefs.

1368
01:25:14.958 --> 01:25:16.292
Well...

1369
01:25:18.378 --> 01:25:21.505
I am no longer a cathar.

1370
01:25:22.633 --> 01:25:23.841
How is that possible?

1371
01:25:24.384 --> 01:25:26.677
It's been very difficult.

1372
01:25:27.179 --> 01:25:29.847
You've dropped your adherence
to the cathar faith?


1373
01:25:30.015 --> 01:25:32.975
- Yes, I have.
- Good.


1374
01:25:33.143 --> 01:25:37.980
Normally I'd be reluctant to comment
on anyone's religion, but...


1375
01:25:38.148 --> 01:25:39.649
What?

1376
01:25:40.525 --> 01:25:43.611
I'm sorry. I guess...
I guess I'm a bit of a bigot. I just...


1377
01:25:43.779 --> 01:25:48.074
I could never take seriously any
religion that worships on Tuesdays.


1378
01:25:48.533 --> 01:25:52.495
Major religions require worship on the
weekend. Friday, Saturday or Sunday.


1379
01:25:52.663 --> 01:25:54.872
I find it just really laudatory...

1380
01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:58.250
That people sacrifice
their weekend time to worship God.


1381
01:26:00.545 --> 01:26:05.257
Having the sabbath on Tuesday
always seemed very bizarre to me.


1382
01:26:05.842 --> 01:26:07.843
It's not right.

1383
01:26:08.011 --> 01:26:11.013
You know what?
We'd better get to the lone star.


1384
01:26:11.682 --> 01:26:13.933
Why are you so concerned
about that?


1385
01:26:14.101 --> 01:26:18.062
Well, it's not as if international
dance crazes start every day.


1386
01:26:22.359 --> 01:26:24.026
We'd better hurry.

1387
01:26:32.452 --> 01:26:34.078
What's wrong?

1388
01:26:34.246 --> 01:26:36.455
Another fiasco.

1389
01:26:40.711 --> 01:26:43.754
Sometimes our struggle reminds me
of the myth of sisyphus.


1390
01:26:43.922 --> 01:26:45.548
- Who?
- The myth about the guy...


1391
01:26:45.716 --> 01:26:49.218
Who pushes an enormous rock
only to have it keep rolling back.


1392
01:26:49.386 --> 01:26:51.429
Oh, yeah. What a knucklehead.

1393
01:26:51.596 --> 01:26:54.557
The important thing to remember
is that he was mythical.


1394
01:26:54.725 --> 01:26:57.059
He never really existed.

1395
01:26:57.978 --> 01:27:00.855
Violet? Did you spend any part
of your education...


1396
01:27:01.023 --> 01:27:03.065
At willamette montessori?

1397
01:27:03.233 --> 01:27:04.567
In Oregon?

1398
01:27:05.193 --> 01:27:06.652
Why?

1399
01:27:08.363 --> 01:27:11.282
Sound like "tweaker."

1400
01:27:11.450 --> 01:27:14.410
Would you say today is very gray?

1401
01:27:14.578 --> 01:27:16.579
I'd say so. Maybe blue-gray.

1402
01:27:17.914 --> 01:27:20.583
Yeah, no, that rings a bell now.

1403
01:27:22.210 --> 01:27:23.836
Bye.

1404
01:27:24.004 --> 01:27:27.423
I'm sorry. Her name wasn't
Emily tweeter, but Lucy wurlitzer.


1405
01:27:27.591 --> 01:27:31.260
They're not similar. I'm beginning
to realize that the human memory...


1406
01:27:31.428 --> 01:27:34.597
Is not the foolproof instrument
we sometimes imagine.


1407
01:27:34.765 --> 01:27:38.809
What's worse, everyone knew about
my obsession, including my parents...


1408
01:27:38.977 --> 01:27:41.270
Those from whom
I most wanted it kept.


1409
01:27:41.438 --> 01:27:46.650
So from your earliest years, you were
already a playboy or operator type?


1410
01:27:46.818 --> 01:27:49.820
Yes. I suppose that's why secrecy
seemed so desirable.


1411
01:27:52.324 --> 01:27:54.492
Violet, can we talk?

1412
01:28:00.874 --> 01:28:03.375
- What's the plural of doofus?
- Doufi.


1413
01:28:03.543 --> 01:28:05.127
Not doofuses?

1414
01:28:05.295 --> 01:28:06.754
You can say either.

1415
01:28:06.922 --> 01:28:09.507
"Doufi" respects the Latin root
and is preferred.


1416
01:28:09.674 --> 01:28:13.427
"Doofuses" is also correct,
although a bit inelegant.


1417
01:28:13.595 --> 01:28:16.388
- You've thought a lot about this.
- Yes, I've had to.


1418
01:28:17.724 --> 01:28:19.725
Why? What is it?

1419
01:28:21.812 --> 01:28:26.107
I like Fred, he's a nice guy.
And I can see why you like him.


1420
01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:30.486
When I first met you and rose,
I thought you were the cool crowd.


1421
01:28:30.654 --> 01:28:34.532
And in many ways you are. I find your
perfume and fashion sense excellent.


1422
01:28:34.699 --> 01:28:36.200
Thank you.

1423
01:28:36.368 --> 01:28:38.160
But there's a reason, I think...

1424
01:28:38.328 --> 01:28:43.791
Why you are
so strongly attracted to...


1425
01:28:44.334 --> 01:28:45.960
Doufi.

1426
01:28:46.128 --> 01:28:49.380
And it's not an accident
how different groups divide up.


1427
01:28:49.548 --> 01:28:50.673
Isn't that a rainbow?

1428
01:28:50.841 --> 01:28:52.675
- That's a rainbow!
- Thor.


1429
01:28:52.843 --> 01:28:55.678
No, Thor! Thor, no! Stop!

1430
01:28:56.388 --> 01:28:58.514
Please, stop!

1431
01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:05.980
He's headed for robertson hall!

1432
01:29:16.908 --> 01:29:18.659
Red. Orange.

1433
01:29:18.827 --> 01:29:22.329
Yellow. Green. Blue. Indigo.

1434
01:29:23.039 --> 01:29:26.625
Hallelujah! Lord God, thank you.

1435
01:29:28.712 --> 01:29:30.671
Education. Education.

1436
01:29:30.839 --> 01:29:33.716
We can learn the subjects
we set out to master...


1437
01:29:33.884 --> 01:29:37.720
No matter how hard
or impossible they may seem.


1438
01:29:37.888 --> 01:29:39.597
Thank you.

1439
01:29:39.764 --> 01:29:42.933
Thank you.
I wasn't sure I was gonna make it.


1440
01:29:44.394 --> 01:29:45.394
Magenta.

1441
01:29:47.022 --> 01:29:50.107
Pink. Mauve.

1442
01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:56.405
I miss my nice American friend.

1443
01:29:56.573 --> 01:29:58.240
No, you're mistaken.

1444
01:29:58.408 --> 01:30:01.744
- You go to London for four weeks?
- Six.


1445
01:30:03.413 --> 01:30:06.040
It's dangerous,
parents letting children travel.


1446
01:30:06.208 --> 01:30:09.919
They send them off and they don't
know what they'll be getting back.


1447
01:30:10.587 --> 01:30:12.922
I don't know what you're referring to.

1448
01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.633
You're not from London.

1449
01:30:16.885 --> 01:30:20.512
I'm from London.
I was there, now I'm here.


1450
01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:22.056
I'm from London.

1451
01:30:22.641 --> 01:30:24.558
I just miss my nice American friend.

1452
01:30:25.769 --> 01:30:26.977
Nice?

1453
01:30:27.145 --> 01:30:30.606
Nice? Fine. I'm fine.

1454
01:30:31.775 --> 01:30:34.318
Those are not adjectives
I like to use.


1455
01:30:34.486 --> 01:30:37.821
God gave us abilities.
He requires that we use them.


1456
01:30:37.989 --> 01:30:42.284
Good, better, best,
excelsior, higher.


1457
01:30:42.786 --> 01:30:45.120
Only excellence
can glorify the lord.


1458
01:30:45.288 --> 01:30:47.748
Vulgarity is, in essence,
blasphemous.


1459
01:30:52.879 --> 01:30:55.256
I'm sorry
for what I was saying before.


1460
01:30:55.423 --> 01:30:57.633
Of course you're not linked
to the doufi...


1461
01:30:57.801 --> 01:31:00.302
Or even
that such distinctions are valid.


1462
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:06.016
No, don't apologize.
I probably do have a doufi orientation.


1463
01:31:06.810 --> 01:31:11.313
But behind coolness,
isn't there a certain repressing...


1464
01:31:11.481 --> 01:31:15.484
Squashing down, or lack
of cultivation of one's humanity?


1465
01:31:15.652 --> 01:31:20.489
Oh, so you think that cool people
have less humanity?


1466
01:31:20.657 --> 01:31:23.617
No, I don't think cool people
are entirely inhuman.


1467
01:31:23.785 --> 01:31:26.078
Just enough to be cool.

1468
01:31:26.663 --> 01:31:29.039
In our society,
there's all this propaganda...


1469
01:31:29.207 --> 01:31:32.835
In favor of uniqueness,
eccentricity, et cetera.


1470
01:31:33.003 --> 01:31:37.965
But does the world really want
or need more of such traits?


1471
01:31:38.383 --> 01:31:42.052
Aren't such people
usually terrible pains in the neck?


1472
01:31:42.554 --> 01:31:44.638
What the world needs
to work properly...


1473
01:31:44.806 --> 01:31:48.183
Is a large mass of normal people.

1474
01:31:48.351 --> 01:31:50.477
I would like to be one of those.

1475
01:31:50.645 --> 01:31:52.229
Sorry.

1476
01:31:53.064 --> 01:31:55.357
But you'll still do the part?

1477
01:31:56.901 --> 01:31:58.777
Yeah, of course.

1478
01:32:06.369 --> 01:32:08.120
So do you know every number...

1479
01:32:08.288 --> 01:32:12.041
- ...in every Fred Astaire movie?
- There were two in our school musical.


1480
01:32:12.208 --> 01:32:14.877
- I know those.
- Did performing those two numbers...


1481
01:32:15.045 --> 01:32:19.131
Help you overcome feelings
of discouragement and despair?


1482
01:32:19.299 --> 01:32:21.091
Absolutely.
