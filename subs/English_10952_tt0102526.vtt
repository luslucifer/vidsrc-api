<i>Unemployment is up,

<i>... with nearly 200,000 more claims
for unemployment last month.</i>


3
00:00:51.987 --> 00:00:56.549
<i>Americans whose income is below the
poverty line has risen to 2 million...</i>


4
00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:59.487
<i>... compared to 1.6 million in 1979.</i>

5
00:00:59.728 --> 00:01:01.992
<i>Economists say that the
economic inequality...</i>


6
00:01:02.197 --> 00:01:05.325
<i>... is at its worst level since
the days of the Great Depression.</i>


7
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:11.065
<i>Over the last 3 years, the percentage of
after-tax income for the rich rose 3%...</i>


8
00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:14.341
<i>... while after-tax income
for the poor fell.2%.</i>


9
00:01:14.576 --> 00:01:16.440
<i>Homelessness is at an all-time high.</i>

10
00:01:16.644 --> 00:01:20.239
<i>A drive-by shooting in Harlem resulted
in the death of a 7-year-old boy.</i>


11
00:01:20.514 --> 00:01:22.880
<i>Police say the shooting
was drug-related.</i>


12
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.643
<i>Said a police source,
"The kid just got in the way."</i>


13
00:01:25.853 --> 00:01:30.517
<i>The bodies of 3 young black men
were discovered in Marcus Garvey Park.</i>


14
00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:34.023
<i>Police believe they were victims
of a drug deal gone bad.</i>


15
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:38.095
<i>The identity of the victims
has been withheld.</i>


16
00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:43.029
<i>Firemen were summoned to extract a man
from a ventilator duct of a building.</i>


17
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.207
<i>The man became trapped when he entered
the duct in order to rob the premises.</i>


18
00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:53.343
<i>The deficit now stands
at an astounding $ 221 billion.</i>


19
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:58.448
<i>A reputed crime lord and 10 of his
henchmen were gunned down today.</i>


20
00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.621
<i>Witnesses said the gunmen
rode past Mr. Armeteo...</i>


21
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.120
<i>... and sprayed the group with gunfire.</i>

22
00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:08.020
<i>The shooting was the result
of an ongoing turf war.</i>


23
00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:45.792
Biff...

24
00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.260
...look at you now.

25
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.797
Nino, please!

26
00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:50.400
Don't start bitching up.

27
00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:53.003
You don't have my product or my money.

28
00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:57.072
You gotta give me another chance!
Please!


29
00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.710
Brothers don't wait to get paid.

30
00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:01.470
Money talks.
Bullshit runs the marathon.


31
00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.844
So, see you,
and I wouldn't wanna be you.


32
00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:17.085
<i>The number of addicted
infants born in Manhattan...</i>


33

<i>... has risen over the past few years.</i>

34
00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:21.330
<i>Hospital officials say...</i>

35
00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:25.697
<i>... that the care required by these
tiny victims of the cocaine epidemic...</i>


36
00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:30.635
<i>... has severely impacted the
available resources for pediatric care.</i>


37
00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:35.711
<i>In other news, an unidentified man found
floating facedown in the East River...</i>


38
00:03:35.981 --> 00:03:39.473
<i>... is believed to be another victim
in an ongoing drug war...</i>


39
00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:42.482
<i>... that continues to plague our city.</i>

40
00:03:45.157 --> 00:03:46.988
Get out of my shit.

41
00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:56.166
Thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory forever and ever. Amen.


42
00:03:57.502 --> 00:04:00.665
I like to pray before I start
scrambling. Keeps people honest.


43
00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:02.840
Say that shit, say that shit.

44
00:04:03.074 --> 00:04:05.338
Do this now. What's your price?

45
00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:08.341
Yo, man. For you, 
Bob Marley, 17.

46
00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.482
For a key? You must be
doing the dope. Bring this down.


47
00:04:12.684 --> 00:04:14.208
You got to get realistic.

48
00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.252
I'm talking about a lower price. Down.

49
00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:22.992
This ain't Delancy Street, and you can't
Jew me down. That's my price.


50
00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:27.687
Check this out, homeboy.
God's on your side, right?


51
00:04:27.932 --> 00:04:31.561
Why don't we do this reasonable?

52
00:04:32.603 --> 00:04:35.401
You wanna do this correct or not?
Seventeen.


53
00:04:35.606 --> 00:04:37.096
Let me see the money.

54
00:04:38.442 --> 00:04:40.103
Come on. Let's do this, man.

55
00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:47.082
What you know about that?

56
00:06:27.717 --> 00:06:29.707
Everybody out! Get down!

57
00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:31.684
Everybody down! Police!

58
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.882
You think you slick, you little punk,
blasphemous dope-fiend bitch!


59
00:06:39.161 --> 00:06:41.527
Spit in my face, 
I'm gonna kill you!

60
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.222
- You fucking that kid up.
- He's kicking his monkey ass.


61
00:06:45.567 --> 00:06:47.694
Ease back, goddamn it! I'm a cop!

62
00:06:51.907 --> 00:06:53.135
Shut the fuck up!

63
00:06:53.342 --> 00:06:55.810
It's over. You have the right
to remain silent.


64
00:06:56.011 --> 00:07:00.948
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.


65
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.759
I'm gonna get paid.

66
00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:21.767
If I make this, you're gonna have
to come out your pockets.


67
00:07:37.218 --> 00:07:39.482
- Ain't made that shot in years.
- Pay your taxes.


68
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.120
I'm like the IRS.

69
00:07:43.824 --> 00:07:45.553
That's it! I love it.

70
00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:54.563
What's up? Where you going?

71
00:08:04.078 --> 00:08:05.545
Remember when we was kids...

72
00:08:06.147 --> 00:08:08.775
...we played for Reverend Oates?
MO AB Bitty Squad?


73
00:08:09.784 --> 00:08:12.446
I was 11, you was 13.
We was the baddest backcourt...


74
00:08:12.653 --> 00:08:14.280
...in Each
-One
-Teach
-One.

75
00:08:15.156 --> 00:08:16.919
We wasn't making no money then.

76
00:08:17.158 --> 00:08:21.595
And now that we are, you're here
living your Michael Jordan fantasy.


77
00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:23.387
Business must be good.

78
00:08:23.597 --> 00:08:25.326
It will be, brother.

79
00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:27.164
Peep this out.

80
00:08:30.938 --> 00:08:32.405
Freebase. So what?

81
00:08:32.606 --> 00:08:35.199
Yo, man, you know the rules.

82
00:08:35.775 --> 00:08:39.108
Us brothers don't be getting high.

83
00:08:39.612 --> 00:08:42.672
Shut the fuck up and drive the car,
you non-talking bastard.


84
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:45.213
You been making money
outside the family?


85
00:08:45.452 --> 00:08:48.444
I just been doing a little
experimentation-type thing.


86
00:08:48.688 --> 00:08:51.521
A little experimentation-type thing.
Like what?


87
00:08:51.791 --> 00:08:56.592
At the clubs, some of the guys step away
from the blackjack table or the bar...


88
00:08:56.796 --> 00:08:59.162
...to buy $50 or
$ 100 worth of sniff.

89
00:08:59.365 --> 00:09:02.027
I set them up in the back room
with a hit of base...


90
00:09:02.235 --> 00:09:06.331
...and 15 minutes after leaving the club,
they'd be back with 2 and 3 people.


91
00:09:06.539 --> 00:09:07.801
So what?

92
00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:13.376
They ain't come back for the cocaine.
They came back for the base.


93
00:09:15.815 --> 00:09:18.613
You sound like
this shit'll change the world.


94
00:09:18.818 --> 00:09:22.982
I don't know about all that
change-the-world shit, but I do know...


95
00:09:23.223 --> 00:09:26.920
...they be going crazy over this.
And the bitches...


96
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.893
Oh, Lord! Them bitches,
they do anything for this, man!


97
00:09:32.599 --> 00:09:36.330
I had my jimmy waxed every day
last week. You understand?


98
00:09:36.569 --> 00:09:38.058
Several times a day.

99
00:09:38.737 --> 00:09:40.398
Get the fuck out of here!

100
00:09:42.508 --> 00:09:45.909
I know damn well ain't nobody
sucked your shriveled-up dick.


101
00:09:46.178 --> 00:09:47.577
You trying to dis me?

102
00:09:47.846 --> 00:09:51.009
I'm just telling the truth.
That's all I'm doing.


103
00:09:52.084 --> 00:09:54.917
Several times a day, my ass.

104
00:09:56.855 --> 00:09:59.915
All right, let me think about this
a little bit.


105
00:10:02.094 --> 00:10:04.085
You think this base...

106
00:10:04.363 --> 00:10:05.921
...is the high-powered shit?

107
00:10:06.198 --> 00:10:10.601
We gonna come off like the Mob.
You understand what I'm saying?


108
00:10:20.712 --> 00:10:24.443
Welcome right here to the Spotlite,
where we make the beat right...


109
00:10:24.716 --> 00:10:28.117
...and we can't fight.
So leave your drugs and go home.


110
00:10:28.554 --> 00:10:30.112
D.J. Clark Kent.

111
00:10:33.392 --> 00:10:37.021
Rocking from turntable number one
to turntable number two.


112
00:10:37.229 --> 00:10:38.753
Just like he want to do.

113
00:10:38.964 --> 00:10:40.555
You gonna frisk me too?

114
00:10:45.469 --> 00:10:49.838
Yo, my boy, Nino in the house.
Yo, Nino. What's up?


115
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.571
You want a flower?

116
00:11:24.742 --> 00:11:27.233
I think you'll like him.
Here he is.


117
00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:29.510
What's up, crew?

118
00:11:30.681 --> 00:11:32.672
Nino, your girl looks good.

119
00:11:34.619 --> 00:11:36.610
You must like slumming, Kareem.

120
00:11:37.622 --> 00:11:42.059
Why would a high-class guy like you
leave a good computer job at the bank...


121
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.160
...come all the way uptown
by gypsy cab...


122
00:11:45.362 --> 00:11:47.262
...to work among a den of thieves?

123
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.658
I'm no dummy.

124
00:11:48.965 --> 00:11:51.024
It's basic common sense and arithmetic.

125
00:11:51.234 --> 00:11:54.431
The difference between
them paying me $800 a week...


126
00:11:54.638 --> 00:11:56.970
...and you paying me $8,000 a week.

127
00:11:57.207 --> 00:11:59.107
I think my cousin also likes the fact...

128
00:11:59.309 --> 00:12:02.176
...that you're in the tradition
of Joe Kennedy.


129
00:12:02.345 --> 00:12:04.108
Who?

130
00:12:05.215 --> 00:12:09.709
Good. Because you gotta rob
to get rich in the Reagan era.


131
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:13.053
They running a strange program.

132
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:16.826
More poor and disenfranchised folks
than this place has ever seen.


133
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.358
They try to act like it don't exist.

134
00:12:19.562 --> 00:12:21.120
Meanwhile, the rich get richer...

135
00:12:21.331 --> 00:12:22.798
And the poor don't get a thing.

136
00:12:22.999 --> 00:12:26.992
Times like these, people wanna
get high. Real high and real fast.


137
00:12:27.237 --> 00:12:28.704
And this is gonna do it.

138
00:12:30.407 --> 00:12:32.671
And make us rich.

139
00:12:34.844 --> 00:12:38.177
I mean, what,
people going crazy over this?


140
00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:41.379
It look like cracked-off pieces of soap.

141
00:12:43.186 --> 00:12:45.847
The Colombians and Dominicans
have shown us the way.


142
00:12:46.088 --> 00:12:48.022
The shit is large.

143
00:12:48.257 --> 00:12:50.316
But we'll do it differently.

144
00:12:50.526 --> 00:12:52.585
No more selling on street corners.

145
00:12:52.861 --> 00:12:55.830
Change the product,
you change the marketing strategy.


146
00:12:56.031 --> 00:12:57.692
I've seen the future.

147
00:12:58.534 --> 00:13:01.196
And its name is The Carter.

148
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.971
Hold up. The Carter Apartments,
that joint is big.


149
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.937
We're talking about
combinating and consolidating.


150
00:13:09.478 --> 00:13:11.537
You're taking over The Carter?

151
00:13:11.747 --> 00:13:16.241
We taking over The Carter. We gonna
bum-rush the whole damn thing.


152
00:13:16.585 --> 00:13:21.079
Now just imagine,
if the tenants cooperate, it's lovely.


153
00:13:21.323 --> 00:13:23.484
They become loyal customers.

154
00:13:23.826 --> 00:13:28.661
If they don't, fuck it. It's like
in Beirut, they become live-in hostages.


155
00:13:28.931 --> 00:13:32.458
We gonna set up a lab here
to make the product.


156
00:13:32.735 --> 00:13:37.502
You hook up the computer, watch out for
the workers, the money and the product.


157
00:13:37.773 --> 00:13:40.037
The Duh Duh Man, Keisha,
we need security...


158
00:13:40.275 --> 00:13:42.709
...to ward off the rival crews,
screen customers.


159
00:13:42.945 --> 00:13:44.776
We also need lookouts...

160
00:13:45.114 --> 00:13:47.548
...here, here and here.

161
00:13:47.883 --> 00:13:49.440
Alert us of 5-0.

162
00:13:50.284 --> 00:13:55.051
One place to make the product,
one place to collect our money.


163
00:13:56.457 --> 00:13:58.118
We will own this fucking city.

164
00:13:58.393 --> 00:14:02.124
You's a genius, man. A pure, un...

165
00:14:04.232 --> 00:14:08.532
Unadulterated. Would you please shut
the fuck up before you have a seizure?


166
00:14:08.970 --> 00:14:12.064
Hey, man, suck my dick.

167
00:14:13.975 --> 00:14:15.909
It's a brilliant plan.

168
00:14:16.144 --> 00:14:18.237
But one thing does concern me, though.

169
00:14:18.579 --> 00:14:21.639
That curry-goat-eating, skinny-ass
Fat Smitty.


170
00:14:22.016 --> 00:14:25.645
He controls The Carter.
Time to sing that fat bitch a lullaby.


171
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.444
Rock-a-bye baby.

172
00:14:27.655 --> 00:14:29.384
He'll be hanging with Elvis.

173
00:14:31.659 --> 00:14:32.887
Damn.

174
00:14:34.095 --> 00:14:35.323
Crack.

175
00:14:43.838 --> 00:14:48.502
Hey, dreadlocks. What did Bombock
have to say? That bitch!


176
00:14:50.011 --> 00:14:51.602
Let me speak with you.

177
00:14:52.612 --> 00:14:55.740
Rastaman, I'm here to tell you
Nino Brown says...


178
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:59.350
...your services are no longer
needed in the community.


179
00:15:03.056 --> 00:15:07.322
That's how you kill somebody. You get
right up on the motherfucker and blam!


180
00:15:07.527 --> 00:15:12.021
Blow his brains all over the sidewalk
in broad daylight.


181
00:15:12.299 --> 00:15:13.698
Rock-a-bye baby.

182
00:15:13.967 --> 00:15:17.960
Brother, I think there's been
a little misunderstanding.


183
00:15:18.472 --> 00:15:22.636
Now look, you are gonna give up
those apartments, huh?


184
00:15:22.976 --> 00:15:26.275
And you are gonna turn over
control of The Carter.


185
00:15:26.813 --> 00:15:28.678
Because if you don't...

186
00:15:28.882 --> 00:15:31.942
...this shotgun blows your big,
fat head off...


187
00:15:32.152 --> 00:15:35.144
...before you can get
your clothes back on.


188
00:15:35.388 --> 00:15:36.616
Is that clear?

189
00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:05.461
If you just say "no,"
what will you say "yes" to?


190
00:18:05.702 --> 00:18:08.364
We say "yes" to education.

191
00:18:08.538 --> 00:18:11.598
We say "yes" to dedication.
We climb up...


192
00:18:11.808 --> 00:18:16.177
...to a higher station
of new spiritual motivation...


193
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.745
...to make a positive impact
on our nation.


194
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:31.789
<i>Sergeant, I'm talking to you.</i>

195
00:18:31.995 --> 00:18:35.988
I wanna know how drug pushers can take
over an entire apartment building...


196
00:18:36.233 --> 00:18:37.495
...right under your nose.

197
00:18:37.901 --> 00:18:41.894
If you lived in The Carter Apartments,
there'd be cops all over the place.


198
00:18:42.339 --> 00:18:45.172
Hey, don't walk away. Listen to me!

199
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:49.675
I fought for this country. We pay taxes
and we're prisoners in our home.


200
00:18:52.182 --> 00:18:54.673
I told the Commissioner
you were running late.


201
00:18:55.852 --> 00:18:58.412
- You got those files?
- Right here.


202
00:19:05.795 --> 00:19:07.387
Let's hope he buys it.

203
00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:12.658
Peretti and Appleton. No way, Stone.
Who else you got?


204
00:19:12.835 --> 00:19:14.769
- They're the ones I need.
- You kidding me?


205
00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:19.771
Nick Peretti almost killed his partner
in a chase, Appleton's on suspension.


206
00:19:19.942 --> 00:19:22.809
- Probation.
- Semantics, Stone.


207
00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:25.069
These two are trouble.

208
00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:31.313
You and I know the system
wasn't ready for this epidemic.


209
00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:34.112
Crack came on the scene
and spread like wildfire.


210
00:19:34.323 --> 00:19:37.087
But now I got the mayor
and the governor on my back...


211
00:19:37.326 --> 00:19:40.090
...and I need some results. Fast.

212
00:19:40.329 --> 00:19:42.229
You get me Nino Brown.

213
00:19:42.431 --> 00:19:45.992
Forget Peretti and Appleton.
The risk is too high.


214
00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:49.935
With all due respect, sir...

215
00:19:50.272 --> 00:19:51.830
...you still don't get it.

216
00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:55.471
You're not giving me what I need
to win this war.


217
00:19:55.678 --> 00:19:57.578
I need cops that know these streets.

218
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.374
I need new jack cops
to take down a new jack gangster.


219
00:20:00.683 --> 00:20:01.945
What you call a risk...

220
00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:04.780
...I think is our only shot.

221
00:20:15.196 --> 00:20:16.561
You got your men.

222
00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:21.731
But I don't want any waves.

223
00:20:23.271 --> 00:20:25.205
Not a goddamn ripple.

224
00:20:54.968 --> 00:20:56.959
<i>Who the hell is this
psychedelic blotter-acid fool?</i>


225
00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:58.398
Be cool.

226
00:20:58.572 --> 00:21:03.509
This is Detective Nick Peretti, a crazy
motorcycle-freak, reject cop, like you.


227
00:21:04.177 --> 00:21:05.940
A wild man no one else wanted.

228
00:21:06.179 --> 00:21:08.271
He means I'm expendable.

229
00:21:08.514 --> 00:21:12.314
Whatever, man. What did you
come here for? To watch me exercise?


230
00:21:12.518 --> 00:21:15.453
I came here to lay a name on you.
Nino Brown?


231
00:21:15.688 --> 00:21:17.315
His sidekick, "Gee Money" wells?

232
00:21:17.523 --> 00:21:19.354
Call themselves
the Cash Money Brothers.


233
00:21:19.525 --> 00:21:21.459
Used to stickup two-bit jewelry stores.

234
00:21:22.127 --> 00:21:26.587
Yeah, thrill-seekers, wanna-be gangsters.
I hate them. So what's up?


235
00:21:26.799 --> 00:21:29.427
What's up is this.
We need some evidence.


236
00:21:29.702 --> 00:21:32.034
Evidence of murder, drug trafficking...

237
00:21:32.238 --> 00:21:35.105
...racketeering, tax evasion. Anything.

238
00:21:35.574 --> 00:21:38.441
We've never been able
to make anything stick on Brown.


239
00:21:38.944 --> 00:21:41.435
No shit. One-third of the department's
on Nino's payroll.


240
00:21:41.647 --> 00:21:44.673
The other 2/3 don't care
unless it affects their community.


241
00:21:44.884 --> 00:21:46.112
What you saying?

242
00:21:46.585 --> 00:21:49.713
Listen.
I've been authorized to set up...


243
00:21:49.922 --> 00:21:52.720
...an independent drug-fighting unit
and I'm picking you.


244
00:21:52.925 --> 00:21:54.984
- Why me?
- What do you mean, why you?


245
00:21:55.194 --> 00:21:59.893
You're from the neighborhood. I can
trust you. And I know you give a shit.


246
00:22:01.166 --> 00:22:02.690
So what's the catch?

247
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:06.502
There's no catch, man.
Why you gotta say that?


248
00:22:06.739 --> 00:22:08.570
Because I know your ass, Stone.

249
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:13.366
- Peretti goes with you.
- This big biscuit-head looking...


250
00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:17.908
Listen! It's not gonna be another
one of your wild-ass solo acts.


251
00:22:18.116 --> 00:22:21.552
Peretti is the only cop I could find
crazy enough to team up with you.


252
00:22:22.587 --> 00:22:24.077
This is my shot.

253
00:22:24.355 --> 00:22:26.915
And you fuck up, it's all on me.

254
00:22:29.294 --> 00:22:33.924
I wanna thank you because you know
I wanna get back in this war.


255
00:22:34.499 --> 00:22:36.433
But this guy, man...

256
00:22:38.303 --> 00:22:39.531
You in or out?

257
00:22:40.772 --> 00:22:42.433
I'm in, all right?

258
00:22:49.047 --> 00:22:52.608
What do you mean,
Frazier won't give up the apartments?


259
00:22:52.884 --> 00:22:57.719
I'm not asking him, I'm telling him!
I'll handle that fat bastard myself!


260
00:23:02.794 --> 00:23:05.456
- We're honored.
- No, I'm honored. Really.


261
00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:14.135
We understand you have
a new Peruvian connection.


262
00:23:15.639 --> 00:23:17.072
So what of it?

263
00:23:17.407 --> 00:23:20.570
We know you've started to centralize
operations at The Carter.


264
00:23:20.777 --> 00:23:25.646
And you didn't notify Don Armeteo,
who takes such things as an insult.


265
00:23:28.652 --> 00:23:29.641
Your point?

266
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:34.723
My point is you fucking guys are cutting
us out of our agreed upon 10%.


267
00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.287
It's time we renegotiate.

268
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.995
I'll tell you what, message boy.

269
00:23:43.934 --> 00:23:46.266
You go back and tell Don Armeteo:

270
00:23:47.004 --> 00:23:49.336
No renegotiating. Fuck that.

271
00:23:50.073 --> 00:23:54.100
The Cash Money Brothers
are a self-contained unit now.


272
00:23:54.444 --> 00:23:56.776
But you come see me next week.

273
00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.110
And I'll hook you up with some of them
collard green linguinis and shit.


274
00:24:02.486 --> 00:24:05.853
Chicken Alfredo. 
Chitlins Alfredo.

275
00:24:08.025 --> 00:24:09.492
Maybe get a better suit!

276
00:24:09.693 --> 00:24:11.251
Fuck you.

277
00:24:14.531 --> 00:24:16.794
Nino, I don't know.

278
00:24:17.199 --> 00:24:19.429
Frankie's an all-right guy.

279
00:24:19.635 --> 00:24:22.468
<i>Fuck them scungili- eating motherfuckers.</i>

280
00:24:22.705 --> 00:24:27.301
This is our thing. They don't wanna
roll with it, we'll roll over them.


281
00:24:43.392 --> 00:24:48.227
<i>This moolanyan must have an MX missile
instead of a cock, he gets so high.</i>


282
00:24:54.737 --> 00:24:56.227
Our snitch was right.

283
00:24:56.505 --> 00:24:58.473
Nino and his Cash Money monkeys...

284
00:24:58.674 --> 00:25:02.166
...are dealing with those spicaroos
up on Broadway and 171 st.


285
00:25:02.411 --> 00:25:04.402
They don't even deny it.

286
00:25:04.747 --> 00:25:07.181
Nor does he accept
our partnership no more.


287
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.780
Now, Gee Money, he was cool.

288
00:25:10.553 --> 00:25:12.714
<i>It was that testa dura, Nino.</i>

289
00:25:18.127 --> 00:25:22.790
You know what I say. You lay down with
Peruvian dogs, you get Spanish fleas.


290
00:25:23.164 --> 00:25:25.223
Soon Nino will itch.

291
00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.792
We'll be there
to scratch the hell out of him.


292
00:25:35.577 --> 00:25:37.067
1700 hours.

293
00:25:37.412 --> 00:25:40.870
Suspects hand out consumables
and the natives are restless.


294
00:25:41.082 --> 00:25:43.243
Yo, shut the fuck up, man.

295
00:25:44.152 --> 00:25:46.211
Ten years as a low-life, murderous bum.

296
00:25:46.421 --> 00:25:50.915
Nino's trying to purchase a conscience.
I ain't buying this Robin Hood bullshit.


297
00:25:51.893 --> 00:25:54.589
Oh shit, that's the kid I shot!

298
00:25:55.997 --> 00:25:59.660
Why don't you lose weight? You look
like a boiled yam wearing a belt!


299
00:26:10.945 --> 00:26:13.880
What's up, baby? Glad to see
somebody cares about the needy.


300
00:26:14.082 --> 00:26:15.777
Why don't you give me a turkey?

301
00:26:16.217 --> 00:26:21.154
Look at your funky black ass.
First you wanna be a stick-up kid.


302
00:26:21.589 --> 00:26:24.079
But then you got shot.
Now you's a basehead.


303
00:26:24.324 --> 00:26:26.349
You're messed up. 
Your life is crap.

304
00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.522
I know I look like stir-fried shit.

305
00:26:29.797 --> 00:26:31.924
Hook me up with some food.

306
00:26:32.132 --> 00:26:33.793
There's a line. 
You gotta wait.

307
00:26:34.468 --> 00:26:36.129
Give this man something to eat.

308
00:26:37.204 --> 00:26:39.035
Hook me up.

309
00:26:39.473 --> 00:26:40.701
This all I get?

310
00:26:41.308 --> 00:26:42.605
You want more?

311
00:26:43.477 --> 00:26:44.876
I'm a veteran.

312
00:26:46.046 --> 00:26:48.037
Here. How's that, all right?

313
00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:52.314
Clean yourself up,
maybe I'll give you a job.


314
00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:53.543
All right, man.

315
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.051
Wanna buy a turkey?

316
00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:56.947
I'm gonna keep an eye on him.

317
00:27:00.727 --> 00:27:04.891
You don't deserve that turkey.
I hooked you up for that last get-high.


318
00:27:05.165 --> 00:27:07.395
Why I gotta be owing you?

319
00:27:07.901 --> 00:27:11.200
I was prom queen of King High School.

320
00:27:11.405 --> 00:27:13.202
This is beneath me.

321
00:27:15.676 --> 00:27:18.577
You were the prom queen.
Now you're the prom fiend.


322
00:27:18.846 --> 00:27:20.746
Look at you.

323
00:27:22.749 --> 00:27:24.011
Hey what?

324
00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:26.841
Didn't I hook you up?
Didn't I walk those 6 blocks...


325
00:27:27.019 --> 00:27:31.479
...to get that pipe from that Iranian
who tried to beat me out of $5?


326
00:27:32.258 --> 00:27:37.093
Didn't I speak to your mother after
the bitch called me a homeless bastard?


327
00:27:37.763 --> 00:27:38.991
Add all that up...

328
00:27:39.165 --> 00:27:43.329
...and the fact that I'm a man who can
beat your ass, I say it's my turkey.


329
00:27:43.536 --> 00:27:45.299
Get away! Get the fuck away!

330
00:27:48.875 --> 00:27:51.435
Stop beating on her! Stop it!

331
00:27:59.118 --> 00:28:00.745
Let go of me, man.

332
00:28:01.287 --> 00:28:05.883
You chump! Beat her up over a turkey.
You're a poor excuse for a brother.


333
00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:10.425
Shit, man! Fuck! Shit!
It's a cop! It's a cop!


334
00:28:12.131 --> 00:28:13.359
Shut up!

335
00:28:18.137 --> 00:28:20.469
Shut up or I'll blow your brains out.

336
00:28:21.407 --> 00:28:22.897
Don't hurt me.

337
00:28:23.142 --> 00:28:25.440
- Shut up!
- I know I was wrong to beat that girl.


338
00:28:25.645 --> 00:28:27.305
Crack has got me.

339
00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:31.010
I got no control over it.
I tried to kick...


340
00:28:31.216 --> 00:28:35.414
...but the shit be calling me.
It be calling me. I gotta go to it.


341
00:28:36.087 --> 00:28:38.214
- I need help, man.
- Come on, man.


342
00:28:43.261 --> 00:28:46.424
- We got a crack monster.
- Your mother's a monster.


343
00:28:47.132 --> 00:28:48.622
- Hold him.
- What you writing?


344
00:28:48.833 --> 00:28:52.325
"Pookie" Benny Robinson. Your name.

345
00:28:53.605 --> 00:28:57.473
- I'm trying to help you.
- You ain't helping nobody!


346
00:28:57.676 --> 00:28:59.701
- It's for your own good.
- Fuck you, man!


347
00:28:59.911 --> 00:29:02.243
- They'll hook you up.
- I'm gonna die!


348
00:29:04.482 --> 00:29:07.110
They're gonna help you.
They'll help you.


349
00:29:24.903 --> 00:29:27.838
I had pretty much
everything I ever wanted.


350
00:29:28.073 --> 00:29:30.007
Everything I thought I wanted.

351
00:29:30.507 --> 00:29:32.907
I always had a need for acceptance.

352
00:29:33.177 --> 00:29:35.304
All my friends were doing it.

353
00:29:35.512 --> 00:29:37.343
Thought I could quit anytime.

354
00:29:38.682 --> 00:29:40.843
That's when I woke up in the hospital.

355
00:29:42.252 --> 00:29:43.913
It's a very simple program.

356
00:29:44.188 --> 00:29:47.351
We only ask that you don't use
or drink one day at a time.


357
00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:50.253
Don't leave before the miracle happens.

358
00:29:52.429 --> 00:29:54.522
This program has revolving doors.

359
00:29:54.765 --> 00:29:58.758
But just because you go out,
don't mean you can come back in.


360
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:12.472
It's crazy, because...

361
00:30:13.450 --> 00:30:17.716
...I did everything. I whored.
I ripped my family off.


362
00:30:17.955 --> 00:30:21.618
I was so scandalous,
I would even sell my baby's Pampers.


363
00:30:22.793 --> 00:30:24.624
I have a crack baby.

364
00:30:25.129 --> 00:30:27.063
He was born blind.

365
00:30:29.133 --> 00:30:32.398
I know why he's blind.
Everybody knows why he's blind.


366
00:30:32.803 --> 00:30:37.068
I kept telling myself I was
gonna kick, but I never did.


367
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.130
I'm a junkie.

368
00:30:40.076 --> 00:30:41.737
I'll be one the rest of my life.

369
00:31:06.936 --> 00:31:09.769
It's the first time
I've ever been away for so long...


370
00:31:10.006 --> 00:31:13.271
...and personally, I hope I never see
you motherfuckers again.


371
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:17.441
When I get out, I'll just take
everything one day at a time.


372
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.170
One day at a time.

373
00:31:25.688 --> 00:31:29.954
Chill out. You been out two minutes
and already you want a job.


374
00:31:30.193 --> 00:31:33.788
It's not just a job. 
You saved my life.

375
00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:38.363
Let me pay you back.
Let me help you bring Nino down.


376
00:31:38.633 --> 00:31:42.967
He promised me a job.
I'll take his money and report to you.


377
00:31:43.205 --> 00:31:44.467
I don't know.

378
00:31:45.307 --> 00:31:48.470
You know what will happen
if I stay on the streets.


379
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:53.545
I need to be a part of something.
If you don't believe in me, who will?


380
00:31:59.321 --> 00:32:02.779
<i>Cool. You've been inside,
checked out the operations.</i>


381
00:32:03.825 --> 00:32:06.988
All right, Pookie.
Parks, come help me out.


382
00:32:07.229 --> 00:32:09.220
Tell me what goes on in this dump.

383
00:32:09.498 --> 00:32:13.195
It took me a while,
but I've been through the whole joint.


384
00:32:13.401 --> 00:32:16.928
First, at the entrance, you gotta
show a membership card to this runner.


385
00:32:17.739 --> 00:32:19.172
<i>It's like a video club.</i>

386
00:32:19.407 --> 00:32:22.570
<i>Nino's got it hooked up
like Mission: Lmpossible.</i>


387
00:32:23.178 --> 00:32:26.375
<i>Walking through that courtyard's
like a nightmare.</i>


388
00:32:26.581 --> 00:32:28.845
<i>It's a nation full of zombies.</i>

389
00:32:38.526 --> 00:32:43.088
<i>You're escorted to the second floor where
a worker rings a buzzer and a code.</i>


390
00:32:43.364 --> 00:32:46.356
<i>A little panel on the wall opens up,
you get the crack.</i>


391
00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.693
<i>The code, the buzzer, where that go?</i>

392
00:32:48.936 --> 00:32:53.771
<i>The call goes to the "Drug Store"
where they make the crack.</i>


393
00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:58.978
<i>I heard they got everybody in there
butt naked. Titties hanging...</i>


394
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:01.671
Nino don't trust a motherfucker.

395
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:10.518
Nino's one sick genius.

396
00:33:10.724 --> 00:33:14.524
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
What happens at the Drug Store?


397
00:33:14.728 --> 00:33:18.357
After that, you can take your goodies
home or stay at the Enterprise.


398
00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:20.366
<i>What's the Enterprise?</i>

399
00:33:20.568 --> 00:33:22.763
<i>What am I, your ghetto tour guide?</i>

400
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:25.803
<i>They got all this equipment
and you don't know shit.</i>


401
00:33:26.073 --> 00:33:30.203
<i>When you're smoking crack, they say
that you're "beaming up to Scotty."</i>


402
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:32.379
<i>You're going to another world.</i>

403
00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:36.573
<i>Crack is the final frontier. That's why
they call that room the Enterprise.</i>


404
00:33:38.419 --> 00:33:42.582
<i>People sit down and light that
glass dick and take a hit.</i>


405
00:33:43.623 --> 00:33:48.560
<i>That's some scary shit. Their eyes look
like a rocket ready to blast off.</i>


406
00:33:49.162 --> 00:33:51.221
Nino has most of the apartments?

407
00:33:51.431 --> 00:33:55.561
Man, are you deaf, or what?
The boy controls the whole place.


408
00:33:55.768 --> 00:33:57.793
Nino Brown's a mad scientist.

409
00:33:58.004 --> 00:34:02.338
What did Marvin say? "The boy that
made slaves out of men"? That's Nino.


410
00:34:02.675 --> 00:34:04.233
That's deep.

411
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:12.514
Happy New Year!

412
00:34:15.021 --> 00:34:19.287
Welcome to the Spotlite
with the Flavor Flav.


413
00:34:19.525 --> 00:34:21.720
Everybody say "Happy...

414
00:34:22.962 --> 00:34:24.691
...New Year!"

415
00:34:25.231 --> 00:34:26.698
The fruit of our hard work.

416
00:34:27.133 --> 00:34:30.193
The belief in the
entrepreneurial spirit.


417
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:32.529
The new American Dream.

418
00:34:33.006 --> 00:34:34.234
A toast.

419
00:34:36.876 --> 00:34:40.004
A toast to my family, in life...

420
00:34:40.913 --> 00:34:42.346
...until death.

421
00:34:42.649 --> 00:34:44.047
Happy New Year.

422
00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:49.312
To CMB. On and on.

423
00:34:50.322 --> 00:34:53.223
- Am I my brother's keeper?
- Yes, I am!


424
00:34:53.492 --> 00:34:55.392
Am I my brother's keeper?

425
00:34:56.395 --> 00:34:58.659
Am I my brother's keeper?

426
00:35:01.566 --> 00:35:02.897
I am!

427
00:35:16.415 --> 00:35:17.643
Look at it.

428
00:35:19.017 --> 00:35:22.009
A big reason for this success is you.

429
00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:24.845
But this ain't about success.

430
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:27.181
This is about survival.

431
00:35:27.426 --> 00:35:32.261
We ain't going out like Puss Head,
shot up over a $ 10 bag. You know?


432
00:35:32.731 --> 00:35:34.358
You gotta be smarter than that.

433
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.765
We gotta look out for one another.

434
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:40.261
I feel the same way.

435
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.939
Nothing and no one
will come between you and me.


436
00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.843
Never. Right?

437
00:35:48.512 --> 00:35:50.002
I love you.

438
00:35:50.514 --> 00:35:52.072
I love you too.

439
00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:55.582
Let's go get busy.

440
00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:01.588
Frank Needles out here.

441
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:07.258
Let him in.

442
00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:15.531
My ace-boon-coon!
How you doing?


443
00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:17.840
Happy New Year.
What's a matter...


444
00:36:18.042 --> 00:36:20.772
...too rich to toast the New Year
with an old friend now?


445
00:36:20.978 --> 00:36:24.573
If it isn't the thinking man's Rocky.
How are you doing?


446
00:36:24.782 --> 00:36:26.113
Great. Love the hair.

447
00:36:26.384 --> 00:36:30.787
The Don and I, we was thinking,
let's let bygones be bygones, all right?


448
00:36:31.055 --> 00:36:35.219
We congratulate you on your new success,
and as a show of our good faith...


449
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.057
...a gift from the Don.

450
00:36:41.732 --> 00:36:43.199
Open it.

451
00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:54.868
<i>To the moolanyan in charge.</i>

452
00:36:55.078 --> 00:36:56.739
All the best, babe.

453
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.987
You motherfucking creep!
Think you'll get away with that?


454
00:37:10.627 --> 00:37:11.855
I just did.

455
00:37:12.095 --> 00:37:13.722
Step the fuck off, Gigantor.

456
00:37:18.134 --> 00:37:22.798
Now get their silly, spaghetti-eating
asses out of my office.


457
00:37:25.074 --> 00:37:28.305
Frank, come on. Let's go.
Let's get out of here!


458
00:37:46.429 --> 00:37:49.921
<i>It's total slamboyancy
in the Spotlite tonight.</i>


459
00:37:50.166 --> 00:37:54.761
You're about to get rocked by some
cool, mellow fellows from Brooklyn.


460
00:37:55.003 --> 00:37:59.906
I'm talking about Aaron, Damien,
Teddy, Slim, Guy.


461
00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:01.674
Give it up.

462
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:10.877
Slim, give a little bit of bass.

463
00:39:19.887 --> 00:39:22.617
Gee Money, come here,
come here, come here.


464
00:39:23.891 --> 00:39:26.382
That the skeezer you met
at Frankie's strip joint?


465
00:39:26.627 --> 00:39:28.288
Yeah, Uniqua.

466
00:39:28.963 --> 00:39:32.228
What's up, brother?
You fucking her correctly, or what?


467
00:39:32.633 --> 00:39:36.569
Once, but I just met her. You know,
I need time to get to know her.


468
00:39:37.905 --> 00:39:39.236
I heard that.

469
00:39:41.242 --> 00:39:42.971
Lord, have mercy.

470
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:51.209
<i>You wanna play rough?</i>

471
00:39:52.086 --> 00:39:54.213
<i>Say hello to my little friend.</i>

472
00:40:04.164 --> 00:40:05.927
The world is mine.

473
00:40:06.166 --> 00:40:08.657
And the brothers too, now.
Don't forget us.


474
00:40:08.935 --> 00:40:11.426
The world is yours, Nino.

475
00:40:11.671 --> 00:40:16.165
Only you won't be as careless
as Tony Montana, now will you?


476
00:40:16.443 --> 00:40:18.240
You absolutely right.

477
00:40:18.445 --> 00:40:20.345
I like this girl of yours.

478
00:40:20.614 --> 00:40:23.048
He ain't got no papers
or a leash on me.


479
00:40:23.249 --> 00:40:26.184
You know what happens
when dogs don't have a leash.


480
00:40:26.953 --> 00:40:29.751
They run the streets
and fuck everything in sight.


481
00:40:34.461 --> 00:40:37.953
It's true. I ain't got no papers
or no leash on her.


482
00:40:38.198 --> 00:40:39.859
But nothing comes between us.

483
00:40:40.133 --> 00:40:42.192
The world is mine!

484
00:40:42.469 --> 00:40:44.130
All mine!

485
00:40:45.038 --> 00:40:47.006
What the fuck are you doing up there?

486
00:40:47.641 --> 00:40:50.439
A man like you, Nino,
needs to leave a legacy.


487
00:40:50.644 --> 00:40:54.546
A son. A mark to let the world know
that he was here.


488
00:40:58.818 --> 00:41:00.479
You know, you absolutely right.

489
00:41:00.719 --> 00:41:03.813
Shit. It ain't like I ain't
been trying. Ain't that right?


490
00:41:06.692 --> 00:41:07.920
She can't have kids.

491
00:41:08.894 --> 00:41:10.521
She can't fuck, either.

492
00:41:10.729 --> 00:41:12.959
Maybe that's why
she can't have no kids.


493
00:41:13.165 --> 00:41:15.895
That ain't right, man.
That ain't right.


494
00:41:17.002 --> 00:41:19.334
- She can't?
- She can't.


495
00:41:20.906 --> 00:41:24.239
- Too bad.
- You're goddamn right that's too bad.


496
00:41:41.393 --> 00:41:44.055
Nino, you need to go get your girl.

497
00:41:47.566 --> 00:41:49.727
You're right. I tell you what.

498
00:41:54.273 --> 00:41:57.367
If I was you, I'd be looking
for the pimples on her booty.


499
00:42:00.112 --> 00:42:02.376
Why the fuck did you have
to say that shit?


500
00:42:02.614 --> 00:42:05.207
I told you before she couldn't
make no babies!


501
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.278
I love you!

502
00:42:10.788 --> 00:42:13.882
And now you're taking me for granted.
How can you do that?


503
00:42:14.125 --> 00:42:16.559
This is corny!
This is soap-opera shit!


504
00:42:16.728 --> 00:42:18.753
- You act like I owe you something.
- You do.


505
00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.727
I don't owe you jack.

506
00:42:21.132 --> 00:42:24.624
Okay, you did give me
a couple of books to read.


507
00:42:24.902 --> 00:42:28.963
And helped me build the brothers. But I
was your ticket out of a boring life...


508
00:42:29.307 --> 00:42:33.437
...when your rich doctor daddy was
making house calls at Harlem General.


509
00:42:33.644 --> 00:42:35.635
What's up with that? Right?

510
00:42:35.913 --> 00:42:40.748
When your kleptomaniac mother
was housing shit in Bloomingdales.


511
00:42:41.152 --> 00:42:43.086
Don't throw no shit in my face...

512
00:42:43.321 --> 00:42:45.152
You ever touch me again, I'll...

513
00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.284
Yeah, I'm aware of that situation.

514
00:43:19.489 --> 00:43:21.423
<i>Stone, your man hired an ex-dealer.</i>

515
00:43:21.625 --> 00:43:26.119
I know it seems a little unconventional.
Appleton and Peretti report to me.


516
00:43:26.363 --> 00:43:28.194
<i>- Is it out of control?
- Don't worry.</i>


517
00:43:28.465 --> 00:43:29.796
<i>Don't blow this.</i>

518
00:43:30.133 --> 00:43:33.068
<i>- Does the Commissioner know about this?
- No, not yet.</i>


519
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:34.498
Good.

520
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:43.042
I told you about that new-jack-cop shit.

521
00:43:43.313 --> 00:43:47.875
I give you a chance and you hire a
notorious crackhead. What's with you?


522
00:43:48.151 --> 00:43:50.312
Why don't you get off my dick?

523
00:43:50.554 --> 00:43:54.217
When you're ready to put your sideline
ass on the frontline, let me know.


524
00:43:54.991 --> 00:43:57.323
Excuse me. Is this
some kind of black thing?


525
00:43:57.527 --> 00:44:00.655
Yes, it is, so keep your
toy Mafia butt out of it!


526
00:44:00.997 --> 00:44:04.660
Fuck the Mafia! I'm gonna wax
your high-yellow, narrow-ass butt!


527
00:44:06.469 --> 00:44:09.062
Cool it! Relax, all right?

528
00:44:09.338 --> 00:44:12.535
If you won't handle this,
why don't you send the white boy...


529
00:44:12.741 --> 00:44:15.005
...inside The Carter with
the National Guard?


530
00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.081
What we need is a videotape
of this whole operation.


531
00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:24.513
We need evidence of the
financial records to make it work.


532
00:44:25.855 --> 00:44:28.585
I work there. I'm the lookout from

533
00:44:28.791 --> 00:44:31.021
...in one of the apartment windows.

534
00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.423
I had to fill out an application.
They asked if I still got high.


535
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.461
They remember me from before.

536
00:44:36.665 --> 00:44:40.567
Because I was one of their first loyal
customers. I used to get fucked up.


537
00:44:40.769 --> 00:44:42.259
Cracker barrel, cracker ass.

538
00:44:43.873 --> 00:44:45.534
I got it, I got it.

539
00:44:54.717 --> 00:44:56.708
This belt is really a video camera.

540
00:44:57.219 --> 00:45:00.416
These wire transmitters will be
taped to you for sound.


541
00:45:00.623 --> 00:45:05.287
It'll send your communication to us,
as well as sounds and images around you.


542
00:45:05.561 --> 00:45:07.961
It will also pick up
shit you can't even hear.


543
00:45:08.898 --> 00:45:11.593
You'll be great.
You're the best man for this job.


544
00:45:11.833 --> 00:45:13.300
You're a fucking genius.

545
00:45:13.501 --> 00:45:14.729
Your mother.

546
00:45:15.737 --> 00:45:17.466
Pookie, we're counting on you.

547
00:45:18.139 --> 00:45:20.699
You can help us bring down CMB.

548
00:45:22.477 --> 00:45:23.910
Try this on.

549
00:45:24.979 --> 00:45:27.573
- You with it?
- I'm with it, man.


550
00:45:29.083 --> 00:45:32.143
Let's roll with it. Put it on.

551
00:45:51.039 --> 00:45:53.667
<i>Pookie, come here, man.
Come here.</i>


552
00:45:54.075 --> 00:45:56.441
<i>You know, I told Gee Money
how good you been.</i>


553
00:45:57.278 --> 00:46:00.179
<i>How you've been bringing in
lots of customers.</i>


554
00:46:01.182 --> 00:46:02.843
<i>And you're just a lookout.</i>

555
00:46:03.518 --> 00:46:06.510
<i>Anything that makes them
more money they like.</i>


556
00:46:06.754 --> 00:46:07.982
This might be it.

557
00:46:08.189 --> 00:46:09.781
<i>We're promoting you.</i>

558
00:46:10.124 --> 00:46:11.352
Check it out.

559
00:46:14.728 --> 00:46:16.457
<i>Soon. Let's get going with it.</i>

560
00:46:16.797 --> 00:46:18.128
Jackpot! System!

561
00:46:18.365 --> 00:46:20.196
He's inside! Yes!

562
00:46:20.867 --> 00:46:23.301
This kid's been bringing us
a lot of business.


563
00:46:23.637 --> 00:46:26.606
<i>I'd like to take a shot
at one of those computer terminals.</i>


564
00:46:26.807 --> 00:46:30.208
<i>- Can you program PASCAL?
- Can a white man dance?</i>


565
00:46:30.544 --> 00:46:33.240
<i>I guess not. But people change,
they lose interest.</i>


566
00:46:33.447 --> 00:46:36.712
<i>Today's your lucky day, homeboy.
I'm promoting your ass.</i>


567
00:46:38.418 --> 00:46:39.783
<i>You still on the pipe?</i>

568
00:46:39.987 --> 00:46:41.284
<i>No way.</i>

569
00:46:41.488 --> 00:46:45.151
<i>Good. Real good. Because you'll be
working in the Drug Store.</i>


570
00:46:45.359 --> 00:46:47.554
I'm glad you got confidence in me.

571
00:46:47.828 --> 00:46:49.159
See you.

572
00:46:52.065 --> 00:46:54.465
- Keep an eye on that kid.
- Why? What's wrong?


573
00:46:54.668 --> 00:46:57.228
He's light-fingered.
Keep an eye on the product.


574
00:47:00.173 --> 00:47:03.665
I don't think Pookie's ready
to be in a room full of crack.


575
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:07.243
I'm ready. Don't I look ready now?
I was born ready.


576
00:47:07.514 --> 00:47:10.244
- Ready to die.
- Stay out of this.


577
00:47:13.687 --> 00:47:16.281
He's already on the inside.
With a little more time...


578
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:19.856
...we'll have enough information
to put Nino away for good.


579
00:47:20.092 --> 00:47:21.684
In my opinion, we get him out...

580
00:47:21.894 --> 00:47:23.862
If I want your opinion, I'll give it.

581
00:47:25.931 --> 00:47:27.262
I'm against it.

582
00:47:27.967 --> 00:47:30.435
- But it's your call.
- And your funeral.


583
00:47:38.544 --> 00:47:40.535
We told them, man.

584
00:47:41.547 --> 00:47:43.276
Ready? Shit.

585
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:47.884
You better be ready,
because you owe a lot of people.


586
00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.611
You owe me. You owe yourself.

587
00:47:51.057 --> 00:47:53.184
You owe the whole community.

588
00:47:53.392 --> 00:47:56.452
You even owe my mother.
Yeah, that's right.


589
00:47:56.729 --> 00:47:59.425
A junkie just like you
killed my mother in 1974.


590
00:47:59.632 --> 00:48:02.396
Didn't take money or jewelry.

591
00:48:03.469 --> 00:48:05.300
Just took her life.

592
00:48:05.571 --> 00:48:09.735
I don't know what you got left in your
so-called rehabilitated body.


593
00:48:09.975 --> 00:48:13.570
But you better find something
because you owe a lot of people.


594
00:48:13.813 --> 00:48:16.407
A lot of people. You owe, Pook.

595
00:49:35.058 --> 00:49:36.821
You got skim milk in them titties?

596
00:49:40.397 --> 00:49:43.332
One and a-two and a-three and a-four...

597
00:49:43.534 --> 00:49:46.059
<i>I'll give you something to look at.</i>

598
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:50.829
Superfly, there's something wrong
with your boy.


599
00:49:51.675 --> 00:49:53.575
What's happening with Pookie?

600
00:49:55.379 --> 00:49:58.576
- I have no idea.
- You should, he's your plant.


601
00:49:58.849 --> 00:50:01.511
Cool out. You're jumping the gun.

602
00:50:01.852 --> 00:50:03.843
But something's wrong with your guy.

603
00:50:04.087 --> 00:50:05.987
<i>"Ocho décadas y siete años..."</i>

604
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:09.023
- Is that a secret code for help?
- No, it's a black thing.


605
00:50:09.259 --> 00:50:12.126
I'm tired of your stuff.
I'm tired of this dude.


606
00:50:12.296 --> 00:50:13.524
<i>What's wrong, fool?</i>

607
00:50:13.697 --> 00:50:18.361
<i>Just doing a workout. This is
a tough job. Gotta stay in shape.</i>


608
00:50:19.369 --> 00:50:21.530
A workout like this
boosts worker morale.


609
00:50:21.872 --> 00:50:23.100
You think I'm stupid.

610
00:50:23.607 --> 00:50:25.370
You're a high motherfucker.

611
00:50:28.044 --> 00:50:29.011
<i>You 5-0?</i>

612
00:50:29.178 --> 00:50:31.203
- Shit! His cover's blown!
- Let's go!


613
00:50:32.448 --> 00:50:34.109
Are you 5-0?!

614
00:50:35.518 --> 00:50:36.746
<i>Take him outside...</i>

615
00:50:36.919 --> 00:50:38.784
<i>... and kill him!
And blow the building!</i>


616
00:50:39.288 --> 00:50:41.017
<i>Help me! I'm gonna die!</i>

617
00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:42.689
Let's go!

618
00:51:03.746 --> 00:51:05.111
Let's go!

619
00:51:32.173 --> 00:51:33.868
Let me through!
I'll do the bitch!


620
00:51:51.059 --> 00:51:52.287
Clear!

621
00:52:07.042 --> 00:52:09.533
Police! Get out! Come on!

622
00:52:24.159 --> 00:52:26.719
- Nothing here!
- Let's get out of here!


623
00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:39.562
Come here. Hold on.
Keep your head down.


624
00:52:52.853 --> 00:52:54.320
Scotty!

625
00:52:55.089 --> 00:52:56.647
Where the hell are you?

626
00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:05.659
Touch him, it blows.

627
00:53:05.866 --> 00:53:07.595
- Do this.
- There's too many wires.


628
00:53:07.868 --> 00:53:09.096
Pick one.

629
00:53:09.703 --> 00:53:11.000
Come on!

630
00:53:11.238 --> 00:53:13.433
Light! I can't see! 
Give me a light!

631
00:53:13.841 --> 00:53:16.571
Hold it there. 
Scotty, on three...

632
00:53:16.777 --> 00:53:20.110
...I want you to slowly,
gently pull out the blue wire.


633
00:53:24.251 --> 00:53:27.015
One, two, three.

634
00:53:32.659 --> 00:53:34.626
- One's the ground.
- Which?


635
00:53:34.894 --> 00:53:36.589
- I don't know!
- 3 seconds left!


636
00:54:24.844 --> 00:54:28.507
I knew it! You ain't nothing
but a high-priced ho.


637
00:54:28.948 --> 00:54:30.848
<i>Put Nino on, bitch.</i>

638
00:54:31.451 --> 00:54:32.941
It's for you.

639
00:54:38.023 --> 00:54:39.490
What's up?

640
00:54:39.691 --> 00:54:43.024
<i>I know you're having a good time,
but we were infiltrated.</i>


641
00:54:45.197 --> 00:54:46.528
We shut down The Carter.

642
00:54:47.632 --> 00:54:49.293
Get your ass out here right now!

643
00:54:49.868 --> 00:54:51.096
<i>Now!</i>

644
00:54:57.142 --> 00:54:58.370
Stop!

645
00:55:11.656 --> 00:55:12.884
What happened?

646
00:55:16.661 --> 00:55:18.288
Don't nobody know nothing?

647
00:55:18.497 --> 00:55:20.727
Don't everybody speak at once.

648
00:55:22.067 --> 00:55:24.001
How the motherfucker get in?

649
00:55:26.738 --> 00:55:30.731
Out of all you motherfuckers,
nobody knows jack shit?


650
00:55:34.913 --> 00:55:37.746
The Duh Duh Man.
Duh Duh, what happened?


651
00:55:43.854 --> 00:55:45.685
I'll be a motherfucker.

652
00:55:46.023 --> 00:55:48.184
Don't nobody know nothing?

653
00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.691
What up with this?

654
00:55:52.429 --> 00:55:55.193
Somebody got to know something
was going on.


655
00:55:55.432 --> 00:55:56.763
See what I'm saying?

656
00:55:57.368 --> 00:55:58.926
Ain't that right, Gee Money?

657
00:55:59.703 --> 00:56:02.433
I think Gee Money definitely
knows something.


658
00:56:03.007 --> 00:56:04.599
Gee Money knows something.

659
00:56:07.211 --> 00:56:10.544
You fucked up. 
You fucked up bigtime.

660
00:56:10.948 --> 00:56:13.382
You're incapable of running this shit.

661
00:56:13.717 --> 00:56:16.709
Sit your five-dollar ass down
before I make change.


662
00:56:18.289 --> 00:56:20.450
Kareem brought him to my attention.

663
00:56:21.058 --> 00:56:22.685
We got 300 employees.

664
00:56:22.893 --> 00:56:26.124
I can't keep my
eye on all of them.

665
00:56:27.965 --> 00:56:29.694
If you was taking care of business...

666
00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.926
what? If I was what?
Say it again!


667
00:56:33.137 --> 00:56:34.604
What?!

668
00:56:35.706 --> 00:56:36.695
Nothing.

669
00:56:36.907 --> 00:56:40.707
That's what I thought you said.
Because that's what I got, nothing!


670
00:56:40.911 --> 00:56:44.141
A million-dollar-a-week business
reduced to rubbish!


671
00:56:49.586 --> 00:56:50.951
It's your responsibility.

672
00:56:59.996 --> 00:57:03.159
I never liked you anyway,
pretty motherfucker.


673
00:57:14.844 --> 00:57:18.439
What's the matter, Gee?
What's up with you?


674
00:57:19.115 --> 00:57:23.950
Why are you letting some shit like who
I'm laying the pipe to fuck with you?


675
00:57:24.187 --> 00:57:25.848
You're bigger than that.

676
00:57:27.790 --> 00:57:31.453
Something like this
can never happen again.


677
00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:56.278
Now...

678
00:57:58.987 --> 00:58:00.386
...leave me.

679
00:58:02.557 --> 00:58:04.491
Get the fuck out.

680
00:58:34.089 --> 00:58:36.353
What Gee Money has brought together...

681
00:58:36.858 --> 00:58:38.849
...let no man put asunder.

682
00:58:39.928 --> 00:58:42.089
I now pronounce us man...

683
00:58:42.431 --> 00:58:43.762
...and wife.

684
00:58:46.034 --> 00:58:47.591
You may kiss the bride.

685
00:58:54.208 --> 00:58:58.542
Be not deceived.
Neither fornicators, nor idolaters...


686
00:58:58.779 --> 00:59:02.476
...nor adulterers, nor abusers
of themselves with mankind...


687
00:59:02.683 --> 00:59:05.117
...shall inherit the kingdom of God.

688
00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.120
May your soul rest in peace.

689
00:59:08.556 --> 00:59:09.955
Goodbye, Pookie.

690
00:59:20.735 --> 00:59:23.067
The Commissioner's been
on my ass all night.


691
00:59:23.471 --> 00:59:28.306
Washington is blaming us for losing
thousands of dollars in man-hours.


692
00:59:29.076 --> 00:59:31.306
Not to mention all the cops
we got killed.


693
00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:34.639
The operation was a failure.

694
00:59:35.583 --> 00:59:37.813
We didn't arrest anyone.
No one, man.


695
00:59:38.652 --> 00:59:42.748
We didn't get any evidence. Nothing.
No financial records, nothing.


696
00:59:43.824 --> 00:59:47.157
We still could be out there
fighting scum like Nino Brown...


697
00:59:47.428 --> 00:59:49.157
...except for two things:

698
00:59:52.766 --> 00:59:56.896
I gambled on you,
and you gambled on a crackhead.


699
00:59:57.337 --> 00:59:59.805
- Fuck that!
- That's enough, man!


700
01:00:01.775 --> 01:00:05.836
I'm sorry you lost your budget.
But I lost a friend.


701
01:00:09.849 --> 01:00:12.841
Let it go. Operation's over.

702
01:00:17.524 --> 01:00:18.752
It's over.

703
01:00:21.861 --> 01:00:25.353
It ain't over.
Pookie didn't die for nothing.


704
01:00:28.802 --> 01:00:30.360
<i>Operation's gone...</i>

705
01:00:30.804 --> 01:00:33.500
...Nino's loose, 
Pookie is dead.

706
01:00:33.706 --> 01:00:35.606
I got Pookie killed.

707
01:00:35.809 --> 01:00:39.472
Cut out this self-pitying shit
about you killing Pookie.


708
01:00:39.712 --> 01:00:42.545
If anyone killed him it was me.
I could see it.


709
01:00:42.882 --> 01:00:45.715
How you gonna tell me
you killed Pookie?


710
01:00:48.655 --> 01:00:51.055
Do you remember
when you said I didn't care?


711
01:00:53.492 --> 01:00:57.223
When what the hell was I doing
at Pookie's funeral anyway? Remember?


712
01:01:00.165 --> 01:01:01.962
I used to be Pookie.

713
01:01:02.167 --> 01:01:04.658
How the hell you used to be Pookie?

714
01:01:04.903 --> 01:01:07.167
I was a poor white-trash Pookie.

715
01:01:07.506 --> 01:01:11.533
This whole drug shit, it's not
a black thing, it's not a white thing.


716
01:01:12.411 --> 01:01:15.574
It's a death thing.
Death doesn't give a shit about color.


717
01:01:17.683 --> 01:01:19.150
You don't have to like me.

718
01:01:19.751 --> 01:01:21.844
I don't even know if I like you.

719
01:01:25.357 --> 01:01:27.416
But we're in this together now, partner.

720
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:32.524
You know, a drug dealer
is the worst kind of brother.


721
01:01:33.532 --> 01:01:36.990
He won't sell it to his sister.
He won't sell it to his mother.


722
01:01:37.202 --> 01:01:39.534
But he'll sell it
to his boys in the street.


723
01:01:40.772 --> 01:01:42.433
I don't know about you...

724
01:01:43.942 --> 01:01:46.206
...but I'm ready to kill Nino Brown.

725
01:01:47.112 --> 01:01:48.602
Are you with me?

726
01:01:50.382 --> 01:01:51.872
I'm ahead of you.

727
01:02:06.197 --> 01:02:09.030
Behind door number one,
your head explodes like a melon.


728
01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:14.103
Behind door two, you hook us up with
Gee Money and get the prize, Nino Brown.


729
01:02:15.606 --> 01:02:17.267
Let's make a deal.

730
01:02:20.044 --> 01:02:24.037
You and me always had an understanding.
Besides, I needed a haircut, right?


731
01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.554
<i>My cugino and his friend are hungry.</i>

732
01:02:32.556 --> 01:02:35.719
And I got a feeling
that they can cut you a sweeter deal...


733
01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:37.621
...than any Peruvian.

734
01:02:37.895 --> 01:02:40.455
Enough to maybe throw in
a finder's fee for me.


735
01:02:44.635 --> 01:02:46.102
If I swim with this offer...

736
01:02:46.337 --> 01:02:50.933
You wanted to meet the main man, that's
done. From now on you deal with me...


737
01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:52.539
...and me only.

738
01:03:08.258 --> 01:03:10.351
You will cut me a side deal.

739
01:03:10.727 --> 01:03:12.058
Twenty percent.

740
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:15.320
And you will be obligated
to report to me...


741
01:03:15.665 --> 01:03:17.064
...and me only.

742
01:03:19.102 --> 01:03:20.660
Give me your number.

743
01:03:46.796 --> 01:03:48.024
Don Armeteo.

744
01:03:48.965 --> 01:03:50.865
Nino is about to itch.

745
01:03:53.937 --> 01:03:57.703
- What the fuck is up?
- What's up? Play ball, that's what.


746
01:03:58.708 --> 01:04:00.175
Check!

747
01:04:07.883 --> 01:04:09.111
Can I help you?

748
01:04:09.284 --> 01:04:10.751
I'm here to see Gee Money.

749
01:04:11.587 --> 01:04:13.578
- What's up with these elbows?
- Sucker!


750
01:04:13.889 --> 01:04:15.186
I don't know you.

751
01:04:16.225 --> 01:04:17.453
You know him?

752
01:04:17.626 --> 01:04:20.288
Hold up. I know him. He's cool.

753
01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:23.628
Ease back, playboy. Ease back.

754
01:04:24.466 --> 01:04:27.401
How you feeling, 
Gee Money, my man?

755
01:04:29.738 --> 01:04:31.569
What's up with your man?

756
01:04:33.809 --> 01:04:35.037
Pat him down.

757
01:04:35.944 --> 01:04:37.172
Pat him down!

758
01:04:39.314 --> 01:04:40.804
It's like that?

759
01:04:42.785 --> 01:04:44.275
What the fuck is this?

760
01:04:44.486 --> 01:04:46.716
I don't know you, that's what.

761
01:04:47.423 --> 01:04:49.584
I know you're my man's new contact...

762
01:04:49.925 --> 01:04:51.449
...but I don't trust you.

763
01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:54.561
So since you're interrupting my game,
get the fuck out.


764
01:05:00.235 --> 01:05:01.224
Mr. Money?

765
01:05:01.503 --> 01:05:04.938
Please escort Mr. Washington
off the court. Take him down the block.


766
01:05:05.173 --> 01:05:08.074
And if this dreadlocked
boomboorah even blinks wrong...


767
01:05:08.276 --> 01:05:10.073
...you lullaby his ass.

768
01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:18.910
Don't forget what we talked about
before at Frankie's.


769
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.452
I'm definitely gonna be the next king.

770
01:05:22.623 --> 01:05:25.353
Yo, Keish, I seen that boy
somewhere before.


771
01:05:30.631 --> 01:05:35.034
That's right, I checked him out myself.
He cooler than a fan.


772
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:39.531
And the product is 60 percent cheaper
than what the brothers is paying now.


773
01:05:40.141 --> 01:05:43.269
<i>That will free up
a whole lot of money...</i>


774
01:05:43.511 --> 01:05:45.479
<i>... to do a lot of other things.</i>

775
01:05:46.147 --> 01:05:48.445
Like, maybe take over
another city project?


776
01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:51.041
<i>All right, let's roll with it.</i>

777
01:05:51.319 --> 01:05:53.480
<i>We build and get stronger.</i>

778
01:05:53.721 --> 01:05:55.814
Most definite. 
Most definite.

779
01:05:56.057 --> 01:05:57.854
<i>Money, I'll tell you something.</i>

780
01:05:58.226 --> 01:06:00.217
If he's not who he says he is...

781
01:06:00.561 --> 01:06:02.051
...l'll kill him.

782
01:06:03.164 --> 01:06:04.631
Then I'll kill you.

783
01:06:09.603 --> 01:06:13.733
<i>I don't trust Mr. Washington. So I want
him to stick to me like flies to shit.</i>


784
01:06:17.644 --> 01:06:21.080
When I was young, I was a member
of this gang called the L.A. Boys.


785
01:06:21.348 --> 01:06:22.679
- Lennox Ave.
- You know it.


786
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:28.517
The leader, Jughead, told me to prove
my loyalty, I had to snuff somebody out.


787
01:06:29.856 --> 01:06:31.517
It was like, "No problem."

788
01:06:31.758 --> 01:06:35.353
I said, "An enemy?"
He said, "No, that's too easy."


789
01:06:35.595 --> 01:06:37.426
"It's got to be an ordinary mo."

790
01:06:38.532 --> 01:06:40.261
So I rode down to 23rd.

791
01:06:40.534 --> 01:06:43.935
Copped me a bag of that
Red Devil angel dust.


792
01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:50.775
I got so zooted.

793
01:06:52.612 --> 01:06:56.571
I walked up on this lady. She must have
been a schoolteacher or something.


794
01:06:56.883 --> 01:06:59.875
I was so fucking crazy, man,
I didn't even care.


795
01:07:01.288 --> 01:07:02.880
I stepped to her.

796
01:07:08.628 --> 01:07:10.720
I didn't even stay
to see her body drop.

797
01:07:11.397 --> 01:07:12.887
I just ran.

798
01:07:15.634 --> 01:07:17.397
You must think I'm a demon.

799
01:07:19.905 --> 01:07:21.896
I guess what you was doing...

800
01:07:23.075 --> 01:07:25.566
...it was like business, right?

801
01:07:26.812 --> 01:07:28.074
It wasn't personal.

802
01:07:28.914 --> 01:07:30.142
My brother...

803
01:07:31.317 --> 01:07:32.978
...it's always business.

804
01:07:33.819 --> 01:07:35.218
Never personal.

805
01:07:38.324 --> 01:07:41.657
- Tell your moms I want some bean pies.
- Can I get some?


806
01:07:41.927 --> 01:07:43.417
Come on in, little man.

807
01:07:47.833 --> 01:07:49.323
Two for you.

808
01:07:54.607 --> 01:07:55.835
Two for you.

809
01:07:58.611 --> 01:08:00.977
- Hold up, pop.
- Get your butt out of here, now.


810
01:08:05.951 --> 01:08:07.782
I can take care
of you too, old man.

811
01:08:07.987 --> 01:08:11.514
You better take care of yourself,
because you an ignorant bastard.


812
01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:15.648
You committing genocide on your people
with these silk suits and fancy cars.


813
01:08:15.827 --> 01:08:17.192
Step off, grandpa.

814
01:08:19.097 --> 01:08:20.325
Idol worshiper.

815
01:08:20.531 --> 01:08:23.967
You killing your own people with the
white devils you put in that bottle.


816
01:08:24.168 --> 01:08:25.999
You an idolater.

817
01:08:26.204 --> 01:08:28.331
Reverend Oates,
why are you with this scum?


818
01:08:28.539 --> 01:08:32.202
Shut up!
Nino, let me smoke this old dude.


819
01:08:39.617 --> 01:08:40.845
Look at you.

820
01:08:41.252 --> 01:08:43.777
In two years, they'll be
marking your gravesite.


821
01:08:44.555 --> 01:08:46.989
Me? I'll be right here.

822
01:08:49.661 --> 01:08:51.128
All you kids,
get out of here!


823
01:08:56.401 --> 01:08:57.732
These kids...

824
01:08:59.237 --> 01:09:02.968
...all these people
gather around you like you God Almighty.


825
01:09:03.408 --> 01:09:04.898
Like you love them.

826
01:09:05.176 --> 01:09:06.700
Devils ain't got no love.

827
01:09:06.911 --> 01:09:08.242
You're killing your people.

828
01:09:08.579 --> 01:09:10.240
What can you offer them?

829
01:09:10.515 --> 01:09:12.244
Another "I have a dream" speech?

830
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:15.245
Some of that same shit
you ripping off to me?


831
01:09:15.786 --> 01:09:19.415
Look where we at. Not a pot to piss in,
nor a window to throw it out of.


832
01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.222
You's the fool, old man.

833
01:09:25.429 --> 01:09:27.920
Don't try it, old man.
Don't even think about.


834
01:09:33.136 --> 01:09:34.694
You don't understand, do you?

835
01:09:37.107 --> 01:09:39.940
Idolater, you reap what you sow!

836
01:09:58.295 --> 01:10:00.058
This is some fly shit.

837
01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:04.197
Some George Raft- some
James Cagney-type shit.


838
01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:05.766
You know what I'm saying?

839
01:10:05.969 --> 01:10:08.563
- That's how you living, baby.
- Living large, brother.


840
01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:17.811
Good looking out this afternoon
with that madness.


841
01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.378
Gee Money should've seen it coming.

842
01:10:22.818 --> 01:10:24.809
Old man really wanted to do me,
didn't he?


843
01:10:27.490 --> 01:10:28.718
Old bastard.

844
01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:32.822
But here's something
you might not find so funny.


845
01:10:33.262 --> 01:10:36.163
Your boy Gee Money tried to cut
a side deal with me.


846
01:10:41.937 --> 01:10:44.428
You can't trust anybody these days.

847
01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:48.333
You can trust me. 
I got your back.

848
01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:53.910
Thank you.

849
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:58.013
Now Reverend Oates will say
a few words to the happy couple.


850
01:11:04.527 --> 01:11:08.088
You gotta wait till somebody else
gets some too, okay?


851
01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:14.694
Before we eat up all this cake,
we ought to give a toast...


852
01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:18.765
...to my daughter, my new son-in-law
and our gracious host...


853
01:11:18.974 --> 01:11:20.373
...Mr. Nino Brown.

854
01:12:44.258 --> 01:12:45.885
I got something for you.

855
01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.292
That's my business card.
Call me sometime.


856
01:13:31.003 --> 01:13:33.665
Hey, what's up? 
You still mad at me?

857
01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:35.339
Fuck you, then.

858
01:13:36.108 --> 01:13:39.942
- Where is the Duh Duh Man?
- Probably after that skeezer he was on.


859
01:13:40.613 --> 01:13:41.944
What's up with Selina?

860
01:13:42.181 --> 01:13:44.615
I don't know. Losing her mind,
that's what's up.


861
01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:47.410
You think I care?
This is my world, my money...


862
01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:48.951
...and that's my skeezer.

863
01:13:54.794 --> 01:13:56.022
Hi, Daddy.

864
01:14:07.139 --> 01:14:08.697
Thank you, mister.

865
01:14:17.116 --> 01:14:18.344
Cover me!

866
01:14:37.402 --> 01:14:39.165
Throw me a gun!

867
01:14:40.472 --> 01:14:41.700
Get down!

868
01:14:54.252 --> 01:14:55.514
Motherfuckers!

869
01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:36.450
You're a murderer, Nino!

870
01:15:37.227 --> 01:15:40.128
I've seen you kill too many people!

871
01:15:42.633 --> 01:15:44.123
Cancel that bitch.

872
01:15:44.568 --> 01:15:46.126
I'll buy another one.

873
01:15:49.306 --> 01:15:50.739
I hate you!

874
01:15:51.341 --> 01:15:53.241
I hate you, Nino!

875
01:15:56.313 --> 01:15:58.304
Don Armeteo's on the phone for you.

876
01:16:01.585 --> 01:16:04.554
We made you. We gave you everything.

877
01:16:04.755 --> 01:16:09.158
Shagazzy's, the Spotlite,
the street corners.


878
01:16:10.828 --> 01:16:14.127
So you got cute.
You had to get spanked.


879
01:16:14.331 --> 01:16:16.925
Now you listen to
me. I made this. Me.

880
01:16:17.234 --> 01:16:19.896
I own this city, you slicked-back,
greasy-haired...


881
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:21.230
<i>... son of a bitch!</i>

882
01:16:21.405 --> 01:16:22.770
You're fucked!

883
01:17:02.545 --> 01:17:04.035
<i>This bulletin just in.</i>

884
01:17:04.313 --> 01:17:07.942
<i>In a scene to rival the famed
St. Valentine's Day Massacre...</i>


885
01:17:08.151 --> 01:17:09.880
<i>... of 1920's Chicago...</i>

886
01:17:10.153 --> 01:17:14.351
<i>... Don Armeteo, reputed crime lord,
and 10 of his henchmen...</i>


887
01:17:14.557 --> 01:17:16.821
<i>... were gunned down this afternoon...</i>

888
01:17:17.059 --> 01:17:19.994
<i>I put you two together.
And you guys go off on your own...</i>


889
01:17:20.196 --> 01:17:21.720
...and now you wanna come back.

890
01:17:21.898 --> 01:17:24.298
You're telling me the disk I took
isn't important?


891
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:27.492
I'm telling you,
I hope it is important.


892
01:17:28.404 --> 01:17:32.340
This is Hawkins. We go back to law school.
She's the prosecuting attorney.


893
01:17:33.409 --> 01:17:36.401
The son of a bitch used a little girl
as a bulletproof vest.


894
01:17:36.679 --> 01:17:39.476
Watch your language.
Nino is gonna fall.


895
01:17:39.714 --> 01:17:43.150
- What about the Pookie video?
- It helps, but it's not enough.


896
01:17:43.418 --> 01:17:45.818
Nino isn't in any of the tapes
at The Carter.


897
01:17:46.021 --> 01:17:47.716
He's becoming Mr. Untouchable.

898
01:17:49.858 --> 01:17:53.259
How many more gotta get killed?
I could have smoked this fool myself.


899
01:17:53.528 --> 01:17:57.157
Can we catch him in a drug buy?
Or get a witness who will testify...


900
01:17:57.432 --> 01:17:59.024
...to connect all the dots?

901
01:17:59.267 --> 01:18:04.102
Nino's got great connections. Can we
nail any of them and tie them to Nino?


902
01:18:04.706 --> 01:18:06.196
Check this out.

903
01:18:06.708 --> 01:18:10.075
We got it set up so the
CMB brothers will buy from us.


904
01:18:10.779 --> 01:18:14.237
And I also got it so Nino Brown
definitely doesn't trust Gee Money.


905
01:18:14.449 --> 01:18:16.440
And we'll get it on videotape.

906
01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:40.572
What's up, fellows?

907
01:18:41.141 --> 01:18:42.403
Got the bucks?

908
01:18:42.643 --> 01:18:45.407
So nice of you to make it.
Know what I'm saying?


909
01:18:45.813 --> 01:18:47.576
What can I say?

910
01:18:47.982 --> 01:18:49.609
What's taking him so long?

911
01:18:50.084 --> 01:18:51.779
Nino's not moving. Shit.

912
01:18:51.986 --> 01:18:54.546
- Let's do this.
- Open the briefcase.


913
01:18:59.126 --> 01:19:00.354
Easy.

914
01:19:00.828 --> 01:19:02.056
Very easy.

915
01:19:02.263 --> 01:19:03.662
I thought we was friends.

916
01:19:03.931 --> 01:19:06.593
I told you, it's never personal, B.

917
01:19:06.834 --> 01:19:09.598
Friends is friends. 
This is business.

918
01:19:09.837 --> 01:19:12.499
- Let's see the sample.
- Whatever.


919
01:19:19.847 --> 01:19:21.144
All here, baby.

920
01:19:21.615 --> 01:19:24.140
I knew I knew washington. He's 5-0.

921
01:19:26.353 --> 01:19:27.980
Suck-ass motherfucker.

922
01:19:30.724 --> 01:19:32.521
Punch it! Just do it!

923
01:22:55.158 --> 01:22:57.456
You cut a side deal
with that motherfucker.


924
01:22:58.728 --> 01:23:01.322
Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Gee.

925
01:23:02.899 --> 01:23:04.366
Fucking Cain.

926
01:23:05.468 --> 01:23:07.163
My brother's keeper.

927
01:23:08.404 --> 01:23:09.894
Was it this...

928
01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:13.334
...glass dick you've been sucking on?

929
01:23:15.512 --> 01:23:19.414
Was that it? Now I see how
you let that motherfucker infiltrate.


930
01:23:20.083 --> 01:23:21.846
He used you, Gee.

931
01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:34.557
What ever happened to,
"Am I my brother's keeper?"


932
01:23:35.698 --> 01:23:37.359
You know what happened to it.

933
01:23:40.203 --> 01:23:42.194
"The world is mine."

934
01:23:44.941 --> 01:23:46.533
Remember that?

935
01:23:47.977 --> 01:23:51.435
"Everything is mine. Everything!"

936
01:23:52.782 --> 01:23:54.271
Even my woman.

937
01:23:55.284 --> 01:23:57.218
Is that what this is about?

938
01:23:57.452 --> 01:23:58.885
That fucking skeezer?

939
01:23:59.121 --> 01:24:00.782
You think I give a fuck about her?

940
01:24:00.989 --> 01:24:03.685
Fuck that ho bitch!
I don't give a fuck about her!


941
01:24:03.959 --> 01:24:05.950
It ain't about her.

942
01:24:07.563 --> 01:24:09.053
It's about us.

943
01:24:13.135 --> 01:24:14.568
I love you, man.

944
01:24:22.311 --> 01:24:24.404
You embarrassed me, man!

945
01:24:27.583 --> 01:24:30.677
In front of all them people,
you treated me like I was soft.


946
01:24:30.886 --> 01:24:33.252
You treated me like I was spineless!

947
01:24:34.489 --> 01:24:38.425
We built this shit!
You didn't do this shit by yourself!


948
01:24:39.661 --> 01:24:42.994
You forgot about me, man, your brother.

949
01:24:44.433 --> 01:24:46.162
What has this done to us?

950
01:24:50.339 --> 01:24:51.567
Keisha...

951
01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:53.168
...dead.

952
01:24:54.176 --> 01:24:55.609
The Duh Duh Man...

953
01:24:56.144 --> 01:24:57.371
...dead.

954
01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:01.739
Let's just make it like it was.

955
01:25:03.117 --> 01:25:06.018
Let's be a family.
Let's make it like it was.


956
01:25:06.287 --> 01:25:09.848
Fuck them cars and
them bitches and all that shit.


957
01:25:10.124 --> 01:25:12.115
Fuck that shit!

958
01:25:13.628 --> 01:25:16.654
Let's do us, me and you.
Let's be a family again.


959
01:25:28.542 --> 01:25:30.305
I'm on the run.

960
01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:34.541
It can never go
back the way it was.

961
01:25:38.319 --> 01:25:42.483
But I'll tell you how
we can make it right.


962
01:25:53.734 --> 01:25:55.065
CMB.

963
01:25:55.903 --> 01:25:57.234
CMB!

964
01:25:57.672 --> 01:25:59.230
We all we got.

965
01:26:02.175 --> 01:26:04.666
Am I my brother's keeper?

966
01:26:13.186 --> 01:26:15.017
Yes, I am.

967
01:26:25.632 --> 01:26:27.691
You know where Nino Brown lives?

968
01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:30.535
You heard my man.
I ain't telling you shit.


969
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:34.033
Last summer, me and my boys won
this basketball tournament.


970
01:26:34.274 --> 01:26:37.801
Bought the whole team brand-new
red scooters. So you can kiss my ass.


971
01:26:37.977 --> 01:26:39.205
Kiss my ass with that.

972
01:26:39.379 --> 01:26:43.509
You know something, B?
This dude is a cop. 5-0! B, out!


973
01:26:44.117 --> 01:26:45.675
Come here, punk!

974
01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.215
I know where Nino lives.

975
01:26:49.522 --> 01:26:52.286
He beat this kid who
scrambled for him with a bat.


976
01:26:52.559 --> 01:26:54.857
Poured gas on him
and set him on fire...

977
01:26:55.228 --> 01:26:57.560
...after he shorted him $5.

978
01:26:57.797 --> 01:27:00.459
I hope you kill his black, hardened ass.

979
01:27:01.301 --> 01:27:03.131
He's in apartment 6C.

980
01:27:03.402 --> 01:27:06.132
But watch out.
He got bodyguards on the roof.


981
01:27:10.476 --> 01:27:12.967
<i>Say hello to my little friend.</i>

982
01:27:20.486 --> 01:27:21.817
Buckwheat.

983
01:28:23.381 --> 01:28:24.814
Punk!

984
01:28:26.617 --> 01:28:27.413
Kill him!

985
01:28:27.618 --> 01:28:31.679
How the hell can you wear this and sell
poison to our people? You ain't shit!


986
01:28:36.627 --> 01:28:37.855
Toss him down to me.

987
01:28:44.635 --> 01:28:47.035
That teacher you killed?
That was my mother!


988
01:28:49.974 --> 01:28:51.999
Kick his black ass!

989
01:28:54.979 --> 01:28:58.039
These are the people you squash
and kill with no retribution.


990
01:28:59.817 --> 01:29:01.045
Get your ass up.

991
01:29:08.124 --> 01:29:10.456
This ain't business, bitch.
This is personal.


992
01:29:16.066 --> 01:29:19.035
I wanna shoot you so bad,
my dick's hard.


993
01:29:19.236 --> 01:29:20.669
Coming through, excuse me.

994
01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:25.230
We'll do this the right way.

995
01:29:26.776 --> 01:29:28.004
I'll testify.

996
01:29:28.245 --> 01:29:30.645
Even if it means my life,
I will testify.


997
01:29:30.847 --> 01:29:33.372
Come on. We can't go out like this.

998
01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:34.978
Put the gun down.

999
01:29:43.527 --> 01:29:46.087
Don't throw your life away
on a piece of shit.


1000
01:29:50.567 --> 01:29:52.467
Give me the gun. I'll do it.

1001
01:30:03.713 --> 01:30:05.442
I'll be out in a week.

1002
01:30:06.716 --> 01:30:08.377
You're a dead man.

1003
01:30:15.925 --> 01:30:20.555
Was the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown,
head of the CMB?


1004
01:30:33.242 --> 01:30:35.733
Remove the hat and the sunglasses.

1005
01:30:38.147 --> 01:30:41.742
Detective Appleton, when you
infiltrated the CMB...


1006
01:30:42.017 --> 01:30:44.508
...did the defendant, Mr. Nino Brown...

1007
01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:49.657
...attempt to buy two and a half kilos
of cocaine from you?


1008
01:30:50.259 --> 01:30:52.489
Did he? Can Michael Jordan slam-dunk?

1009
01:30:52.761 --> 01:30:55.286
Of course he did. 
He's a dope dealer.

1010
01:30:55.497 --> 01:30:57.658
That's what they do, buy and sell dope.

1011
01:30:59.435 --> 01:31:00.766
I'm not guilty.

1012
01:31:01.236 --> 01:31:02.999
You're the one who's guilty.

1013
01:31:03.906 --> 01:31:07.273
You lawmakers, the politicians,
the Colombian drug lords...


1014
01:31:07.509 --> 01:31:10.444
...all you who lobby against
making drugs legal.


1015
01:31:10.779 --> 01:31:13.645
Just like you did with alcohol
during Prohibition.


1016
01:31:13.848 --> 01:31:15.611
You're the one who's guilty.

1017
01:31:16.951 --> 01:31:19.511
Let's kick the ballistics here.

1018
01:31:19.787 --> 01:31:22.278
Ain't no Uzis made in Harlem.

1019
01:31:22.690 --> 01:31:26.683
Not one of us in here
owns a poppy field.


1020
01:31:26.961 --> 01:31:30.021
This thing is bigger than Nino Brown.
This is big business.


1021
01:31:30.298 --> 01:31:32.289
This is the American way.

1022
01:31:33.534 --> 01:31:37.095
I'm sure that the court
was enlightened...


1023
01:31:37.305 --> 01:31:39.705
...by your geopolitical tirade.

1024
01:31:39.974 --> 01:31:43.933
Unfortunately, society at large
is not on trial here.


1025
01:31:44.212 --> 01:31:46.703
You are, Mr. Brown.

1026
01:31:47.382 --> 01:31:49.213
Were you or were you not...

1027
01:31:49.484 --> 01:31:54.319
...head of the narcotics consortium,
the murderously bloody...


1028
01:31:54.522 --> 01:31:56.046
...CMB?

1029
01:31:58.393 --> 01:32:01.385
I could not hear you.
Would you please speak up?


1030
01:32:01.663 --> 01:32:03.824
Yes, I was a member.

1031
01:32:04.332 --> 01:32:06.459
But I was forced
into this way of life.

1032
01:32:07.335 --> 01:32:10.065
I've been dealing drugs
ever since I was 12 years old.


1033
01:32:10.338 --> 01:32:14.172
I didn't have the chances
that you have, Miss Hawkins.


1034
01:32:14.409 --> 01:32:19.072
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
in my mouth, Miss Hawkins.


1035
01:32:21.181 --> 01:32:25.345
I wanted to get out,
but they threatened to kill my mother.


1036
01:32:25.552 --> 01:32:29.010
Who are you talking about,
Mr. Brown? What "they"?


1037
01:32:29.756 --> 01:32:30.984
They.

1038
01:32:31.858 --> 01:32:34.588
Look at him. Kareem Akbar.

1039
01:32:35.962 --> 01:32:39.921
That's right, the educated brother from
the bank. He's the head of the CMB.


1040
01:32:40.133 --> 01:32:41.725
The brains behind the whole thing.

1041
01:32:41.935 --> 01:32:44.995
This is bigger than Nino Brown,
and I got a list to prove it.


1042
01:32:45.205 --> 01:32:48.265
If I'm going down, I'm taking
a lot of people with me.


1043
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:50.540
Order in the court!

1044
01:33:10.897 --> 01:33:13.957
Your Honor, may counsel
approach the bench?


1045
01:33:15.902 --> 01:33:18.735
- What's going on?
- I don't know.


1046
01:33:22.475 --> 01:33:23.965
What's the discussion?

1047
01:33:31.083 --> 01:33:33.574
The court is not pleased
with this application.


1048
01:33:33.986 --> 01:33:37.649
You understand that by pleading
guilty to a lesser charge...


1049
01:33:37.923 --> 01:33:42.758
...the court, under law, can impose
a sentence of 3 years to life...


1050
01:33:43.429 --> 01:33:47.490
...with parole eligibility
after 12 months. Do you understand?


1051
01:33:50.002 --> 01:33:51.299
Absolutely.

1052
01:33:52.671 --> 01:33:54.366
How could you let this happen?

1053
01:33:54.573 --> 01:33:58.566
We wanted some of the crack
off the streets. I wanted Nino too.


1054
01:33:58.778 --> 01:34:02.680
He gave up his connections
and Powell wanted to make the deal.


1055
01:34:03.849 --> 01:34:05.077
Let's go.

1056
01:34:06.986 --> 01:34:08.954
This court is now adjourned.

1057
01:34:10.022 --> 01:34:13.150
What? All he gets is a year?

1058
01:34:13.425 --> 01:34:14.858
This ain't happening.

1059
01:34:16.195 --> 01:34:18.857
I should have killed you myself, bitch.

1060
01:34:19.865 --> 01:34:22.196
That's the difference between
you and me.


1061
01:34:22.534 --> 01:34:25.594
Don't get mad, Tito. It's the law.

1062
01:34:26.638 --> 01:34:28.037
Sucks, huh?

1063
01:34:28.973 --> 01:34:33.808
When this is over with,
you can come and work for me.


1064
01:34:39.284 --> 01:34:41.149
Did you turn state's evidence?

1065
01:34:41.452 --> 01:34:43.181
Did you sell out CMB?

1066
01:34:43.388 --> 01:34:44.787
You pleased with the outcome?

1067
01:34:44.989 --> 01:34:48.550
Absolutely. The American justice system
is the greatest in the world.


1068
01:34:48.827 --> 01:34:50.385
I'm proud to be an American.

1069
01:34:50.595 --> 01:34:52.790
- Hi, Mom.
- Idolater!


1070
01:34:52.997 --> 01:34:55.989
Your soul is required in hell!
