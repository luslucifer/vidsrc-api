1
00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.464
You should've quit after Godfried.

2
00:03:47.718 --> 00:03:49.220
Stop it now. Come on, guys.

3
00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.534
Was it a busy night?

4
00:04:54.869 --> 00:04:55.911
It was OK.

5
00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:58.414
You must be glad
you can finally go to bed.


6
00:05:01.041 --> 00:05:02.334
I quite like blondes.

7
00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:05.087
Or brunettes. I don't care.

8
00:05:08.799 --> 00:05:11.218
Someone like you is worth her price.

9
00:05:15.598 --> 00:05:16.807
What do you think you're doing?

10
00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:17.933
Sure you have money on you?

11
00:05:18.058 --> 00:05:19.643
Of course I do!

12
00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:21.437
This ride is free, darling...

13
00:05:21.562 --> 00:05:23.147
if you'd be so kind?

14
00:05:25.524 --> 00:05:27.109
I've finished for tonight, darling.

15
00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:29.445
Don't be such a baby.
Put in some overtime.


16
00:05:32.364 --> 00:05:33.908
Just take me home.

17
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.328
Shut up!

18
00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:39.079
Fucking bitch! 
Who do you think you are?

19
00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:41.332
Don't take me for a mug.

20
00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:43.501
Dirty slut.

21
00:05:43.584 --> 00:05:44.919
Get on with it.

22
00:05:53.093 --> 00:05:54.178
Fucking whore.

23
00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:22.665
Are you all right, girl?

24
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.792
Yes, I'm OK.

25
00:08:08.687 --> 00:08:10.397
Welcome to Amsterdam.

26
00:08:10.481 --> 00:08:12.066
The capital of Holland,

27
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:15.653
and world famous for its many canals.

28
00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:19.156
There are over 165 canals,

29
00:08:19.281 --> 00:08:22.326
totaling a length of ten miles.

30
00:08:22.451 --> 00:08:24.328
They run through the whole city,

31
00:08:24.453 --> 00:08:28.415
and were dug in the 17th century
to transport goods from the harbor


32
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.709
to the merchants' warehouses.

33
00:08:30.793 --> 00:08:33.837
Amsterdam has 750,000 residents,

34
00:08:33.921 --> 00:08:37.383
who all live in
approximately 200,000 houses.


35
00:08:37.466 --> 00:08:40.177
These are all built on wooden piles.

36
00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:43.263
Amsterdam was built
on about 100,000 wooden piles.


37
00:08:43.347 --> 00:08:46.183
So don't stamp too hard,
or the whole city will collapse.


38
00:10:03.886 --> 00:10:05.429
Be careful, it's loaded.

39
00:10:05.554 --> 00:10:07.806
Your final hour has come.

40
00:10:07.931 --> 00:10:10.517
Put it back. It's not a toy.

41
00:10:15.022 --> 00:10:16.607
You forgot the bullets.

42
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.985
You've been in the
bath for half an hour!

43
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.196
And yesterday you came home far too late.

44
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:24.406
Is that a reason to shoot your dad?

45
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.325
It's nearly 8:45 a.m.

46
00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.411
You'll make me late for school.

47
00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:31.330
You don't have to wait for me.

48
00:10:31.413 --> 00:10:33.248
You said you'd take me, remember?

49
00:10:33.373 --> 00:10:35.084
My bicycle was stolen yesterday.

50
00:10:35.209 --> 00:10:36.585
Oh yes, I forgot.

51
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:39.004
Why don't you people
do something about that?


52
00:10:39.088 --> 00:10:42.925
Do you know how many bicycles
are stolen in Amsterdam every year?


53
00:10:43.258 --> 00:10:46.386
I haven't the foggiest. Two? Three?

54
00:10:47.763 --> 00:10:49.556
Hello. Anneke Visser speaking.

55
00:10:50.265 --> 00:10:53.227
He's been playing with himself
in the bath for the last half hour.


56
00:10:53.894 --> 00:10:56.980
Yes. Eric! Police Headquarters for you.

57
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.948
Eric speaking.

58
00:11:10.494 --> 00:11:12.621
I do try to
give her a decent upbringing.

59
00:11:14.164 --> 00:11:15.707
I'd said I'd come in later today.

60
00:11:17.793 --> 00:11:19.044
From a bridge?

61
00:11:20.754 --> 00:11:22.589
All right. I'm coming.

62
00:11:24.299 --> 00:11:26.802
- Did they find my bicycle?
- Not yet.


63
00:11:26.885 --> 00:11:28.053
I thought as much.

64
00:11:29.471 --> 00:11:30.848
- Ready?
- Ages ago.


65
00:11:30.973 --> 00:11:33.892
- Have you got all your books?
- Yes! You just get a move on.


66
00:11:33.976 --> 00:11:35.561
Did you feed the cat?

67
00:11:37.104 --> 00:11:38.730
Morning, Amsterdam!

68
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:48.031
Bye!

69
00:12:02.504 --> 00:12:05.257
FM, 94.3.

70
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.301
City Radio Amsterdam.

71
00:13:16.245 --> 00:13:18.330
The police are on their way.
I've called them.


72
00:13:18.622 --> 00:13:19.665
What about my cake?

73
00:13:20.123 --> 00:13:22.793
Who's paying for that?
You'd think it was for free.


74
00:13:22.918 --> 00:13:24.836
Couldn't you have been more careful?

75
00:13:34.263 --> 00:13:35.555
Give them back to me, OK?

76
00:13:38.058 --> 00:13:40.477
I don't have all day. Twat!

77
00:14:09.423 --> 00:14:10.424
We started without you.

78
00:14:10.507 --> 00:14:11.842
I had to drop by the baker's.

79
00:14:12.467 --> 00:14:13.635
Is that her?

80
00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.804
Yes. Badly mutilated with a knife.

81
00:14:15.887 --> 00:14:17.431
The perpetrator must be deranged.

82
00:14:17.472 --> 00:14:18.473
Who is she?

83
00:14:18.598 --> 00:14:20.434
A hooker. Potter is investigating.

84
00:14:20.642 --> 00:14:22.686
They've taken photos. 
The autopsy is next.

85
00:14:22.811 --> 00:14:24.730
- Has she been raped?
- Didn't look like it.


86
00:14:24.813 --> 00:14:28.191
She was stabbed down the street
and dragged into the canal.


87
00:14:28.275 --> 00:14:29.401
This is where she was hanging?

88
00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.237
Upside down,
her feet tied with a bowline knot.


89
00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:35.157
- Sailor?
- It's possible.


90
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.075
Good.

91
00:14:37.159 --> 00:14:38.535
Any witnesses?

92
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.953
No, nobody.

93
00:14:40.037 --> 00:14:42.664
No witnesses, no fingerprints.

94
00:14:43.206 --> 00:14:46.043
It must have happened
between 1:00 and 3:00 a.m.


95
00:14:46.126 --> 00:14:48.003
They're dragging the canal.
We may find something.


96
00:14:48.086 --> 00:14:51.673
One has to have a weird sense of humor
to expose your victim like that.


97
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:53.884
It seems as if he's proud of it.

98
00:14:53.967 --> 00:14:56.178
Hi, Eric. We have a witness.

99
00:14:56.303 --> 00:14:57.763
Are you sure?

100
00:14:57.846 --> 00:15:00.599
Tell this gentleman
what you've told me, please.


101
00:15:02.684 --> 00:15:04.061
It was a monster.

102
00:15:04.144 --> 00:15:05.270
A monster?

103
00:15:05.937 --> 00:15:07.022
I saw it all.

104
00:15:07.397 --> 00:15:09.066
A big, black monster.

105
00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:12.194
With huge claws and feet.

106
00:15:12.778 --> 00:15:13.987
It emerged from the water.

107
00:15:14.071 --> 00:15:16.740
From the water? 
Did he have a boat?

108
00:15:17.324 --> 00:15:20.786
From the water. 
I saw it with my own eyes.

109
00:15:22.913 --> 00:15:24.122
What do you think?

110
00:15:24.206 --> 00:15:27.334
I don't know.
She's not exactly a reliable witness.


111
00:15:27.417 --> 00:15:29.753
But she's the only one we've got
at the moment.


112
00:15:30.003 --> 00:15:32.964
What do you think she means by
"a big, black monster


113
00:15:33.048 --> 00:15:34.341
with huge claws"?

114
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.885
No idea. Does your mother-in-law
have an alibi?


115
00:15:37.969 --> 00:15:40.764
Let's wait for the autopsy.
We can't do much until then.


116
00:15:41.932 --> 00:15:45.143
Maybe the neighborhood search will provide
some clues. I've deployed eight men.


117
00:15:45.268 --> 00:15:48.730
Let's hope so. As yet, it's not a case
that would get you promoted.


118
00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:04.204
Why are you sitting in the dark?

119
00:16:04.704 --> 00:16:05.914
Willy is in a trance.

120
00:16:06.039 --> 00:16:08.834
He says he's able to contact
his deceased aunt.


121
00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:10.627
Oh, here we go again!

122
00:16:11.336 --> 00:16:13.463
I thought he was going to help you
with your homework.


123
00:16:13.547 --> 00:16:15.173
We've finished!

124
00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:18.176
- I can't do it like this.
- Did you make contact?


125
00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.096
Almost, but this is not
the right environment.


126
00:16:21.179 --> 00:16:23.014
Whatever.

127
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.018
It requires deep concentration.

128
00:16:27.102 --> 00:16:29.187
I'm going to try again at home.

129
00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:31.898
I think you suck, man.

130
00:16:32.023 --> 00:16:33.191
Can we put the light back on?

131
00:16:33.275 --> 00:16:36.194
Sure, Willy can't concentrate anyway.

132
00:16:36.319 --> 00:16:38.321
You're just jealous
you don't have my gift.


133
00:16:39.114 --> 00:16:40.073
Gift!

134
00:16:40.157 --> 00:16:43.160
- You're not staying for dinner?
- My mother has made macaroni.


135
00:16:43.243 --> 00:16:45.245
- Bye, Mr. Visser.
- Bye, Willy.


136
00:16:45.328 --> 00:16:47.372
- Give my regards to your aunt.
- Will do.


137
00:16:47.456 --> 00:16:48.540
See you tomorrow, Anneke.

138
00:16:48.874 --> 00:16:49.916
Bye-bye.

139
00:16:52.127 --> 00:16:53.253
How was school?

140
00:16:53.336 --> 00:16:54.546
It was OK.

141
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:56.298
Did you buy any peanut butter?

142
00:16:56.423 --> 00:16:59.259
- Is it gone?
- You forgot to get it yesterday, too.


143
00:16:59.342 --> 00:17:01.636
Then you do the groceries from now on.

144
00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.472
And no chocolate sprinkles either.

145
00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:07.309
Honey, there is more to life
than peanut butter and sprinkles.


146
00:17:07.392 --> 00:17:09.519
Yes. Apple spread.

147
00:17:09.603 --> 00:17:12.772
- You didn't get that either.
- Go and set the table.


148
00:17:12.856 --> 00:17:13.857
What are we having?

149
00:17:13.982 --> 00:17:15.525
Brussels sprouts in chocolate sauce.

150
00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:17.110
I don't like Belgian.

151
00:17:18.612 --> 00:17:24.701
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.


152
00:17:25.285 --> 00:17:26.578
2.25 meters.

153
00:17:26.703 --> 00:17:29.206
3:15 a.m.

154
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:32.959
2.25 meters.

155
00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:57.442
I think we're wasting our time.

156
00:17:57.901 --> 00:18:00.028
Are you sure this is the right spot?

157
00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:02.864
We're exactly above the pipe.

158
00:18:02.989 --> 00:18:04.658
But we aren't having much luck.

159
00:18:04.741 --> 00:18:06.868
We've only got clear water so far.

160
00:18:07.577 --> 00:18:09.371
Maybe we're above the sewers.

161
00:18:10.038 --> 00:18:12.040
We'll be hauling up buckets of shit next.

162
00:18:12.123 --> 00:18:13.750
Keep your voice down.

163
00:18:13.833 --> 00:18:15.001
They might hear us.

164
00:18:15.085 --> 00:18:17.170
I think that factory
is completely shut down.


165
00:18:17.379 --> 00:18:18.463
We'll be waiting for ages.

166
00:18:18.755 --> 00:18:21.883
I suspect it'll happen any time now.

167
00:18:22.008 --> 00:18:24.135
One lot of waste dumping
is enough to make them hang.


168
00:18:26.304 --> 00:18:28.848
I'll do my own dumping.

169
00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:35.188
What are you waiting for? Hurry up!

170
00:18:37.065 --> 00:18:38.441
The bastards.

171
00:18:38.858 --> 00:18:40.110
We've got them.

172
00:18:40.735 --> 00:18:44.948
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.


173
00:18:45.282 --> 00:18:46.616
Haul it up.

174
00:18:47.367 --> 00:18:49.452
- Hurry.
- It's stuck.


175
00:18:49.536 --> 00:18:50.662
What do you mean?

176
00:18:54.624 --> 00:18:56.001
What could it be?

177
00:18:56.418 --> 00:18:57.711
Heavy poison.

178
00:19:04.634 --> 00:19:06.136
What the heck!

179
00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:08.513
I want to get out of here, Kees.

180
00:19:14.561 --> 00:19:16.563
Let's go.
There's something fishy going on.


181
00:19:17.314 --> 00:19:18.607
Raise the anchor!

182
00:19:23.653 --> 00:19:26.906
Did you fill it up with petrol
like I asked you to? Hendrik!


183
00:20:47.445 --> 00:20:49.531
- Why are you stopping?
- There was a man on the ground.


184
00:20:49.614 --> 00:20:52.075
- Where?
- On the waterfront.


185
00:20:52.158 --> 00:20:54.202
- I didn't see a thing.
- I did.


186
00:21:17.058 --> 00:21:19.519
Well, did you have a good chat?

187
00:21:20.854 --> 00:21:22.021
He's gone.

188
00:21:22.564 --> 00:21:25.358
It's all this weird stuff
we have to transport all the time.


189
00:21:25.483 --> 00:21:27.777
They make you see things.

190
00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:30.196
I really did see someone.

191
00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:38.955
The morning shift people found the boat.

192
00:21:39.038 --> 00:21:40.540
Nobody from the factory saw anything?

193
00:21:40.665 --> 00:21:42.667
It was shut down due to maintenance work.

194
00:21:42.751 --> 00:21:45.462
There were only two night watchmen
who claim not to have seen anything.


195
00:22:02.228 --> 00:22:03.813
What were they doing last night?

196
00:22:03.897 --> 00:22:06.483
Taking water samples.

197
00:22:06.608 --> 00:22:08.777
It looks like they've been sampled
by the water monster.


198
00:22:08.902 --> 00:22:10.945
You think it's the same one?

199
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:14.073
The same killer?
I'll let the experts decide.


200
00:22:14.157 --> 00:22:17.994
It would be a mighty coincidence
if there are two such lunatics around.


201
00:22:18.536 --> 00:22:20.205
I've warned you, pal.

202
00:22:20.288 --> 00:22:21.539
If you don't listen...

203
00:22:21.998 --> 00:22:23.208
you'll get hurt.
- There you go.


204
00:22:24.834 --> 00:22:27.629
Who do you think you are? Asshole!

205
00:22:28.963 --> 00:22:30.215
Keep your hair on!

206
00:22:30.298 --> 00:22:33.510
If you take one more pic, I'll shove
that telephoto lens down your throat.


207
00:22:33.593 --> 00:22:36.095
Well, well! No half measures then.

208
00:22:37.972 --> 00:22:39.557
I don't like being photographed.

209
00:22:43.895 --> 00:22:46.648
- It's been a long time.
- Thirteen years, I believe.


210
00:22:46.731 --> 00:22:49.317
Eric, this is John van Meegeren
from the river police.


211
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.693
We have met.

212
00:22:50.985 --> 00:22:53.112
You're going to assist us, 
I've been told.

213
00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:54.989
They thought I might be of help,

214
00:22:55.073 --> 00:22:57.283
with all those bodies
you have to fish out of the water.


215
00:22:57.367 --> 00:22:59.953
Vermeer! Could you come here a second?

216
00:23:01.412 --> 00:23:03.957
- You haven't changed a bit.
- You think?


217
00:23:04.207 --> 00:23:06.292
Still the handsomest one of us both.

218
00:23:06.417 --> 00:23:07.544
Are you still mad at me?

219
00:23:08.127 --> 00:23:10.171
It's no fun when someone
runs off with your girlfriend.


220
00:23:10.588 --> 00:23:11.798
I know all about that.

221
00:23:12.006 --> 00:23:13.883
I hear she's abandoned you, too.

222
00:23:13.967 --> 00:23:15.844
She left me three years ago,

223
00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:17.262
for a painter.

224
00:23:17.387 --> 00:23:19.973
She lives in France now.
She pops over once in a while.


225
00:23:20.139 --> 00:23:21.349
To see Anneke.

226
00:23:21.432 --> 00:23:23.434
You've saved me a lot of grief.

227
00:23:23.893 --> 00:23:25.478
But don't ever do it again.

228
00:23:25.937 --> 00:23:27.313
Whatever you say.

229
00:23:28.314 --> 00:23:29.941
Are you any the wiser?

230
00:23:30.483 --> 00:23:31.693
Not yet.

231
00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:33.528
We're searching the bottom.

232
00:23:33.653 --> 00:23:36.531
It's tricky as the water is very dirty.
Visibility is poor.


233
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:39.993
He's found something.

234
00:23:48.084 --> 00:23:50.670
- What is it?
- A depth gauge.


235
00:23:50.795 --> 00:23:52.714
Part of a diver's equipment.

236
00:23:52.839 --> 00:23:54.549
We're dealing with a diver?

237
00:23:54.632 --> 00:23:56.217
Who knows how long
it's been in the water?

238
00:23:56.426 --> 00:23:58.428
It needs to be checked.
Take it to the lab.


239
00:23:58.595 --> 00:24:01.139
I want to know how long it's lain
at the bottom and where it's from.


240
00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:06.019
A diver prowling the canals of Amsterdam.

241
00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:09.105
It's not great for our reputation.

242
00:24:09.188 --> 00:24:11.065
It could be a
lot of fun this summer.

243
00:24:11.733 --> 00:24:13.192
A diver?

244
00:24:14.277 --> 00:24:15.486
Isn't that a little far-fetched?

245
00:24:15.695 --> 00:24:20.325
It's currently our best bet,
if we rule out the Loch Ness monster.


246
00:24:20.408 --> 00:24:21.784
But you have no witnesses.

247
00:24:21.868 --> 00:24:24.537
- Nobody has seen or heard anything.
- Exactly.


248
00:24:24.621 --> 00:24:26.706
The canals are a perfect hiding place.

249
00:24:26.831 --> 00:24:29.083
You can move around the whole city
without being noticed.


250
00:24:29.417 --> 00:24:30.585
What are your thoughts, John?

251
00:24:30.752 --> 00:24:33.463
Those two
were completely taken by surprise.


252
00:24:33.713 --> 00:24:36.925
It's unlikely that the killer
sailed up to them in a boat.


253
00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:39.218
Some people have bizarre hobbies.

254
00:24:39.385 --> 00:24:40.762
Do you have enough manpower?

255
00:24:40.845 --> 00:24:42.013
For now.

256
00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:45.308
Keep me posted.
Give me a shout if you need anything.


257
00:24:45.642 --> 00:24:47.852
I hope you won't be needing
any more of those flags.


258
00:24:49.604 --> 00:24:52.398
These are all the registered divers
in Holland.


259
00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.441
Great.

260
00:24:53.566 --> 00:24:55.568
Eight and a half thousand suspects.

261
00:24:55.652 --> 00:24:56.986
You're probably among them.

262
00:24:57.153 --> 00:24:58.321
I have an alibi.

263
00:24:58.446 --> 00:25:01.324
I also tracked down the taxi driver.

264
00:25:01.449 --> 00:25:02.742
What did he have to say?

265
00:25:02.825 --> 00:25:05.870
He picked up the victim around 1:30 a.m.

266
00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:10.583
He claims she'd made advances to him
in the car, which he rejected.


267
00:25:10.792 --> 00:25:11.793
He says he chucked her out.

268
00:25:11.918 --> 00:25:13.127
It's likely the other way round.

269
00:25:13.252 --> 00:25:15.546
He's got a watertight alibi
for the rest of the night.


270
00:25:15.672 --> 00:25:16.965
That was to be expected.

271
00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:24.597
Great, let's hear it.

272
00:25:29.268 --> 00:25:30.561
OK, thanks.

273
00:25:31.604 --> 00:25:34.899
They found a small piece of black rubber
on one of the anchor tips.


274
00:25:35.024 --> 00:25:37.068
The lab confirms it's from a wet suit.

275
00:25:37.193 --> 00:25:38.361
We are on the right track.

276
00:25:38.736 --> 00:25:40.738
- Is Potter still investigating that rope?
- Which rope?


277
00:25:40.989 --> 00:25:43.032
The one that was used
to tie our friend to the bridge.


278
00:25:43.116 --> 00:25:44.575
We know the maker.

279
00:25:44.701 --> 00:25:47.036
All the shops and outlets
are being checked.


280
00:25:47.161 --> 00:25:49.956
Good to hear lots of people
are busy making a living.


281
00:25:50.623 --> 00:25:52.750
- It's nearly noon.
- Time for lunch?


282
00:25:52.959 --> 00:25:54.335
If you can stomach it.

283
00:25:56.212 --> 00:25:59.382
Sixteen stab wounds,
at least eight fatal ones.


284
00:26:00.174 --> 00:26:04.470
It was such a mess in there,
some organs have almost swapped places.


285
00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:07.765
A broken neck, two broken ribs.

286
00:26:07.849 --> 00:26:09.934
Shattered nasal bone. 
Water in the lungs.

287
00:26:10.268 --> 00:26:12.186
Several bruises and grazes.

288
00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.272
He must have gone berserk.

289
00:26:14.355 --> 00:26:17.358
- And the murder weapon?
- A sharp knife.


290
00:26:18.818 --> 00:26:21.112
Look. This is the tip.

291
00:26:21.863 --> 00:26:24.115
The force of the stabbing
caused it to break off.


292
00:26:24.323 --> 00:26:27.201
It was probably a carving knife,
with a blade measuring


293
00:26:27.493 --> 00:26:29.537
9 to 12 inches.

294
00:26:30.204 --> 00:26:32.540
The stomach contained some red wine

295
00:26:32.665 --> 00:26:34.042
and the remains of two hamburgers,

296
00:26:34.375 --> 00:26:36.085
most likely from McDonald's.

297
00:26:36.377 --> 00:26:38.588
Was she dead before she hit the water?

298
00:26:38.755 --> 00:26:40.048
Not quite.

299
00:26:40.298 --> 00:26:42.467
That explains
the amount of water in the lungs.


300
00:26:42.925 --> 00:26:44.719
The job was finished under water.

301
00:26:45.511 --> 00:26:49.140
But she was dead before
she was suspended from the bridge.


302
00:26:50.475 --> 00:26:52.602
This one can go back in the freezer.

303
00:26:53.352 --> 00:26:55.313
And here we have our fishing friends.

304
00:26:56.147 --> 00:26:58.733
They were savaged even more viciously.

305
00:26:59.275 --> 00:27:02.320
I'll save you the irrelevant details.

306
00:27:03.196 --> 00:27:05.198
One of them was decapitated.

307
00:27:05.823 --> 00:27:08.367
Everything seems to indicate
that it happened under water.


308
00:27:08.826 --> 00:27:11.829
Both stomachs showed
remains of a vegetarian meal.


309
00:27:12.371 --> 00:27:14.874
Lentils, millet, carrot juice...

310
00:27:14.957 --> 00:27:17.293
But one of them had eaten
a sausage afterwards.


311
00:27:17.627 --> 00:27:19.337
A knife was used here as well.

312
00:27:19.796 --> 00:27:21.297
But a different type.

313
00:27:21.547 --> 00:27:24.092
This one had a serrated blade.

314
00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:26.677
I've seen it once before.

315
00:27:26.886 --> 00:27:28.429
- It concerned...
- A dive knife.


316
00:27:28.679 --> 00:27:30.932
- That's right.
- A dive knife?


317
00:27:31.307 --> 00:27:33.559
Every diver has a knife on him.

318
00:27:33.935 --> 00:27:37.438
So they can cut themselves loose
in case they get stuck somewhere.


319
00:27:37.563 --> 00:27:40.483
In this case, it was used
for a very different purpose.


320
00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.073
Now we know who we're looking for,

321
00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:48.866
how are we going to catch the bastard?

322
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:51.285
You tell me.
After all, it's one of your colleagues.


323
00:27:51.494 --> 00:27:53.412
The only thing I know about him

324
00:27:53.496 --> 00:27:56.165
is that he is strong,
has a black wet suit,


325
00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:57.750
and probably misses his depth gauge.

326
00:27:57.834 --> 00:27:59.752
Not enough to arrest someone.

327
00:27:59.836 --> 00:28:01.712
No, it doesn't get us anywhere.

328
00:28:01.796 --> 00:28:03.381
Apart from the registered divers,

329
00:28:03.506 --> 00:28:06.384
there are at least 10,000 sport divers
in Holland.


330
00:28:06.592 --> 00:28:09.053
Let's start our search around Amsterdam.

331
00:28:09.303 --> 00:28:11.973
It has to be someone
who knows the city and its canals well.


332
00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:13.891
A top-off, gentlemen?

333
00:28:13.975 --> 00:28:15.143
Yes, please.

334
00:28:19.147 --> 00:28:22.650
That murdered quiz master three years ago.

335
00:28:22.775 --> 00:28:25.236
- You didn't have many clues then either.
- Did you follow that case?


336
00:28:25.319 --> 00:28:27.613
- It was in all the newspapers.
- We had zilch.


337
00:28:27.738 --> 00:28:31.159
At first we suspected the candidates
who'd never won anything.


338
00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:33.411
But everyone had a watertight alibi.

339
00:28:34.954 --> 00:28:37.165
It took us nine weeks
to find the perpetrator.


340
00:28:37.415 --> 00:28:39.292
How did you track him down?

341
00:28:39.625 --> 00:28:42.253
Sometimes you need patience,
some intuition,


342
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:45.631
and luck. A little luck goes a long way
in our profession.


343
00:28:58.019 --> 00:28:59.061
SEA WOLF

344
00:29:29.842 --> 00:29:31.177
Can I help you?

345
00:29:31.552 --> 00:29:34.305
- I'm just looking around.
- You don't want to become a member?


346
00:29:34.388 --> 00:29:36.515
- No, I'm a detective.
- I knew it.


347
00:29:37.058 --> 00:29:39.352
You people have gone over
the records this morning.


348
00:29:39.435 --> 00:29:41.395
These things are unavoidable, sir.

349
00:29:41.479 --> 00:29:43.272
What do you do here?

350
00:29:43.356 --> 00:29:44.815
I'm the manager here.

351
00:29:44.899 --> 00:29:46.651
I already told you people this morning.

352
00:29:46.734 --> 00:29:48.069
What are you doing here?

353
00:29:48.194 --> 00:29:50.404
This is the largest diving society
in Amsterdam.


354
00:29:50.488 --> 00:29:52.490
In The Netherlands. 
And the best one.

355
00:29:52.573 --> 00:29:55.076
Don't think we only bother you.

356
00:29:55.785 --> 00:29:57.703
Do you mind if
I have a look around?

357
00:29:58.079 --> 00:29:59.956
I am not in
a position to refuse you.

358
00:30:01.332 --> 00:30:03.125
This is where our gear is stored.

359
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:05.211
Our members are allowed to use it freely.

360
00:30:05.378 --> 00:30:08.172
- How many members are there?
- Over 1,400.


361
00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:16.264
Do you lose many of these?

362
00:30:16.347 --> 00:30:17.598
How do you mean?

363
00:30:17.765 --> 00:30:20.309
Do the members return everything
you lend them?


364
00:30:20.393 --> 00:30:22.228
I've never had any problems.

365
00:30:22.353 --> 00:30:25.481
You don't suppose one of our members
is involved with those murders?


366
00:30:25.731 --> 00:30:27.525
We all do weird things at times.

367
00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.360
All our members are respectable people.

368
00:30:29.443 --> 00:30:32.154
They have better things to do
than swim in those filthy canals.


369
00:30:32.905 --> 00:30:34.323
You can't see a thing in there.

370
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:37.326
And the rubbish they dump
gives you all kinds of diseases.


371
00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:38.536
No.

372
00:30:38.619 --> 00:30:41.580
We organize trips to the sea, or abroad.

373
00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:43.124
We look for derelicts,

374
00:30:43.249 --> 00:30:45.126
or coral reefs. 
It's a proper sport.

375
00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:49.422
I can't imagine anyone
diving in those canals for fun.


376
00:30:49.547 --> 00:30:52.550
You've got a whole weapon arsenal.

377
00:30:52.633 --> 00:30:54.343
We have all the permits.

378
00:30:54.677 --> 00:30:57.888
All divers are required to have one.
Careful, it's sharp.


379
00:30:58.931 --> 00:31:00.266
I know.

380
00:31:01.684 --> 00:31:04.979
And this? Is that also a requirement?

381
00:31:05.187 --> 00:31:06.856
It's for angling.

382
00:31:08.232 --> 00:31:09.275
For sharks?

383
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.152
If they become too curious.

384
00:31:13.446 --> 00:31:16.949
- If you'll excuse me?
- I won't keep you any longer.


385
00:31:50.191 --> 00:31:51.192
Good afternoon.

386
00:31:54.695 --> 00:31:57.907
- There.
- Do you need any help?


387
00:31:59.658 --> 00:32:00.951
Yes, please.

388
00:32:01.327 --> 00:32:04.330
These things are all right in the water,
but very heavy on the bank.


389
00:32:06.749 --> 00:32:08.834
- Are you also a member?
- Not yet.


390
00:32:10.503 --> 00:32:12.797
- Have you been doing this long?
- A few weeks.


391
00:32:12.922 --> 00:32:14.924
I'm still getting used to it.
It makes my muscles ache.


392
00:32:15.007 --> 00:32:16.133
Why did you start diving?

393
00:32:16.425 --> 00:32:19.011
A friend recommended it.
Are you interested?


394
00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.221
Perhaps.

395
00:32:20.388 --> 00:32:21.931
- How did it go, Laura?
- Fine.


396
00:32:22.014 --> 00:32:25.810
Found your first suspect?
He's a policeman, be careful what you say.


397
00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:28.437
Did someone fail to pay
their parking ticket?


398
00:32:28.521 --> 00:32:30.398
He hasn't got any trouble parking.

399
00:32:30.523 --> 00:32:32.817
- Who?
- We're investigating a murder case.


400
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:35.069
Oh, the heavy-duty stuff?

401
00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.197
Can I buy you a drink?

402
00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:40.282
If you don't mind waiting.

403
00:32:40.366 --> 00:32:42.118
I have to have
a shower and get changed.

404
00:32:42.243 --> 00:32:43.285
I'll wait.

405
00:32:43.536 --> 00:32:45.579
OK, see you in
the canteen in 15 minutes.

406
00:33:10.229 --> 00:33:13.357
I thought policemen
never drank while on duty.


407
00:33:13.441 --> 00:33:15.234
I've never been very dutiful.

408
00:33:15.443 --> 00:33:17.194
Have you made any headway?

409
00:33:17.278 --> 00:33:19.238
I've made some progress, yes.

410
00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:21.365
- Long time no see!
- All right?


411
00:33:21.490 --> 00:33:22.533
Martin!

412
00:33:26.203 --> 00:33:28.706
- How are you? It's been a while.
- I've been very busy.


413
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:31.083
This is Mr. Visser
from the Amsterdam police.


414
00:33:31.167 --> 00:33:33.502
- Martin Ruysdael, pleased to meet you.
- Likewise.


415
00:33:33.586 --> 00:33:35.588
They're investigating those murders.

416
00:33:36.172 --> 00:33:39.425
I've read about them. 
Ghastly business.

417
00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.094
It's hard to believe such things
still happen in this day and age.


418
00:33:42.511 --> 00:33:45.264
- Fancy a drink?
- A bourbon, please.


419
00:33:47.641 --> 00:33:49.852
Any idea yet who this maniac could be?

420
00:33:49.935 --> 00:33:51.353
We're working on it.

421
00:33:51.437 --> 00:33:53.063
Are you also a member
of the diving society?


422
00:33:53.189 --> 00:33:54.982
I was for years, but not any more.

423
00:33:55.524 --> 00:33:57.193
I was even on the committee.

424
00:33:57.526 --> 00:33:59.945
But my practice got too busy.

425
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:01.739
You're a doctor?

426
00:34:01.822 --> 00:34:02.948
Psychiatrist.

427
00:34:03.032 --> 00:34:04.783
- Here's to you, Martin.
- Thanks.


428
00:34:05.826 --> 00:34:07.411
I no longer had time for it.

429
00:34:07.703 --> 00:34:10.789
The last time I went scuba-diving
was about three years ago.


430
00:34:11.415 --> 00:34:13.959
- Have you ever done any diving?
- No, never.


431
00:34:14.043 --> 00:34:16.045
I recommend it.
It's very refreshing for the spirit.


432
00:34:16.837 --> 00:34:19.590
Especially in southern waters.
The coral reefs, the underwater fauna...


433
00:34:19.673 --> 00:34:22.134
It's a different world. 
Pristine beauty.

434
00:34:22.718 --> 00:34:23.928
I'll think about it.

435
00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:29.767
You're here!

436
00:34:30.142 --> 00:34:31.560
You've met?

437
00:34:31.852 --> 00:34:34.522
He must be the one
who got you into diving.


438
00:34:35.272 --> 00:34:36.899
You were talking about me?

439
00:34:37.274 --> 00:34:39.151
The police always want to know everything.

440
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.403
But I didn't tell him a thing,
don't worry.


441
00:34:41.612 --> 00:34:43.656
I'm afraid we'll have to forgo that drink.

442
00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:46.242
- Are you two leaving?
- We're going to a concert tonight.


443
00:34:46.534 --> 00:34:47.952
Another time, perhaps?

444
00:34:47.993 --> 00:34:48.994
Who knows?

445
00:34:49.036 --> 00:34:50.037
Shall we, darling?

446
00:35:57.980 --> 00:35:59.148
Thank you.

447
00:37:01.543 --> 00:37:03.420
My, aren't we in a hurry!

448
00:37:03.504 --> 00:37:05.172
I'm sorry, I didn't see you.

449
00:37:05.297 --> 00:37:07.257
As long as the Lord sees us, right?

450
00:37:07.341 --> 00:37:08.425
Exactly.

451
00:37:10.969 --> 00:37:14.098
A pity. Such a lovely girl
joining a club like that.


452
00:38:01.979 --> 00:38:03.564
Joop, we're getting rich!

453
00:38:11.113 --> 00:38:12.322
CENTER

454
00:38:14.324 --> 00:38:15.534
Two flags?

455
00:38:15.659 --> 00:38:18.746
Red for where she disappeared,
and yellow for where she was found.


456
00:38:20.038 --> 00:38:22.666
Why did he drag her
so far down the canal?

457
00:38:22.791 --> 00:38:24.209
Maybe he wanted to teach her to swim?

458
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.629
He likes to play with his victims,
so it seems.


459
00:38:27.713 --> 00:38:31.800
We know the victim, where it happened,
what time it happened, but nothing else.


460
00:38:31.884 --> 00:38:33.385
The local search yielded no results.

461
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.846
- Nothing about the rope?
- They're still working on it.


462
00:38:35.971 --> 00:38:38.056
- The rubber from the suit?
- A regular wet suit.


463
00:38:38.307 --> 00:38:39.808
The broken tip of the knife?

464
00:38:39.933 --> 00:38:41.268
You can buy that knife anywhere.

465
00:38:41.393 --> 00:38:43.979
- Depth gauge?
- Nothing yet either.


466
00:38:45.355 --> 00:38:46.857
What about the patrol boats?

467
00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:49.902
We barely managed to get two.
Not enough manpower, it seems.


468
00:38:50.068 --> 00:38:52.780
It's something, but what's the use?

469
00:38:53.572 --> 00:38:56.158
Sooner or later he'll make a mistake.
He's not exactly careful.


470
00:38:56.283 --> 00:38:58.368
I don't want to wait and see.

471
00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:01.121
Visser.

472
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:10.881
I'm not the only one who's dissatisfied.

473
00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:17.596
We can't let that
guy get away with this.

474
00:39:18.597 --> 00:39:20.474
We need some tangible results.

475
00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:23.101
Four victims in four days.

476
00:39:23.185 --> 00:39:25.145
People will wonder
what the heck we're doing.


477
00:39:25.229 --> 00:39:28.357
We're still investigating a few things,
but for now our hands are tied.


478
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:30.192
Still no witnesses?

479
00:39:30.317 --> 00:39:32.236
No one, apart from the homeless woman.

480
00:39:32.736 --> 00:39:34.154
Maybe a few fish.

481
00:39:38.408 --> 00:39:40.911
I just got a
phone call from the mayor.

482
00:39:41.537 --> 00:39:45.499
He has some important visitors and asked
if it was still safe to take a boat trip.


483
00:39:45.582 --> 00:39:46.625
What did you advise him?

484
00:39:46.792 --> 00:39:48.919
That he shouldn't sit
too close to the edge.


485
00:39:52.172 --> 00:39:53.632
I know how you feel.

486
00:39:54.424 --> 00:39:56.051
The feeling of powerlessness.

487
00:39:57.344 --> 00:39:58.762
All you can do is wait

488
00:39:58.887 --> 00:40:01.682
for the critical tip, the crucial clue.

489
00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:05.561
But something needs to be done. We can
hardly declare the canals out-of-bounds.


490
00:40:05.727 --> 00:40:07.479
We might as well evacuate
all of Amsterdam.


491
00:40:07.563 --> 00:40:09.106
It's the safest option.

492
00:40:09.773 --> 00:40:12.150
Drastic, but safe.

493
00:40:15.237 --> 00:40:17.447
Why do you look so glum?

494
00:40:17.531 --> 00:40:19.283
- Is there a reason to be cheerful?
- Maybe.


495
00:40:19.366 --> 00:40:21.618
The lab has researched the depth gauge.

496
00:40:21.702 --> 00:40:24.329
It's almost certain it hasn't been
in the water more than three days.


497
00:40:24.413 --> 00:40:27.332
- So it has to be the killer's?
- We can assume as much.


498
00:40:27.624 --> 00:40:29.751
They also found a large salt deposit.

499
00:40:29.877 --> 00:40:31.545
What does that mean?

500
00:40:31.628 --> 00:40:35.090
We can rule out the divers
diving in fresh waters for now.


501
00:40:35.382 --> 00:40:37.968
We have to look for divers
who've spent a long time


502
00:40:38.051 --> 00:40:40.929
working on oil rigs,
or for a towage company.


503
00:40:41.013 --> 00:40:44.641
If we find out what kind of water
the depth gauge has been used in,


504
00:40:44.725 --> 00:40:46.310
we'd make considerable headway.

505
00:40:46.393 --> 00:40:48.687
Is it possible to determine
the kind of water?


506
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:50.898
Based on the residue of the substances.

507
00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:54.484
- They're working on it.
- We're finally getting somewhere.


508
00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:57.571
- Where are you heading?
- Potter knows where to reach me.


509
00:40:57.905 --> 00:40:59.823
I'm going to look at some art.

510
00:41:52.167 --> 00:41:54.711
Do you like art?

511
00:41:54.795 --> 00:41:56.171
I like pretty things.

512
00:41:58.173 --> 00:41:59.841
How did you find me?

513
00:41:59.925 --> 00:42:01.802
I'm a detective, remember?

514
00:42:02.344 --> 00:42:04.471
I thought you were busy working
on something?


515
00:42:04.554 --> 00:42:06.223
I took the afternoon off.

516
00:42:07.015 --> 00:42:10.894
Do you want go out to dinner with me
tonight, or do you have other plans?


517
00:42:11.561 --> 00:42:13.397
I don't have any other plans.

518
00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.985
I have reserved a table for two, so if you
decline I'll have to ask someone else.


519
00:42:18.235 --> 00:42:20.237
- You sure hit the ground running.
- Sometimes.


520
00:42:23.281 --> 00:42:25.450
Pick me up at my place at six.

521
00:42:25.534 --> 00:42:26.952
Where do you live?

522
00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:28.996
I thought you were a detective?

523
00:42:42.843 --> 00:42:44.594
I'd like to book a table, please.

524
00:42:45.929 --> 00:42:48.473
For tonight, yes. Two people.

525
00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:09.202
You've got good taste.
It seems like an excellent restaurant.


526
00:43:09.286 --> 00:43:12.497
I may have a dirty job,
but that doesn't mean I have to eat filth.


527
00:43:13.749 --> 00:43:16.043
And your daughter?
Can you just leave her home alone?


528
00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:18.545
She's used to my irregular work hours.

529
00:43:19.129 --> 00:43:21.298
She is very capable
of looking after herself.


530
00:43:22.174 --> 00:43:24.801
Can't be easy for
her, a father like you.

531
00:43:24.926 --> 00:43:27.095
I'd hate to be in an office

532
00:43:27.220 --> 00:43:29.347
doing normal hours,
working with normal people.


533
00:43:29.431 --> 00:43:32.184
You don't seem the type
to lead a regular life.


534
00:43:32.267 --> 00:43:34.269
As long as I regularly feel
like I'm living.


535
00:43:39.316 --> 00:43:42.194
What about you? 
Tell me about yourself.

536
00:43:42.819 --> 00:43:43.945
What's there to say?

537
00:43:44.071 --> 00:43:47.574
Plenty. Work, life, the men in your life.

538
00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:50.577
I'm guessing you already know
a thing or two.


539
00:43:51.078 --> 00:43:55.332
I know that you've been married,
you've been abroad, and you've been


540
00:43:55.415 --> 00:43:57.709
working at the national gallery
for the past 18 months.


541
00:43:57.793 --> 00:44:00.587
I'd almost think you've opened
an investigation into me.


542
00:44:01.213 --> 00:44:05.258
We have a superb computer at our disposal.
Press a few buttons, and lo and behold.


543
00:44:05.342 --> 00:44:07.177
Everything you want to know is there.

544
00:44:07.552 --> 00:44:10.222
- Everything?
- Almost everything.


545
00:44:10.931 --> 00:44:13.558
There is plenty left
for an entertaining conversation.


546
00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:15.894
That's a relief.

547
00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:26.071
- Are you seeing the psychiatrist?
- Martin?


548
00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:28.031
No. We're just good friends.

549
00:44:28.198 --> 00:44:30.367
He's been my therapist
for the past six months.


550
00:44:30.867 --> 00:44:33.370
After my husband's death,
I was having some issues.


551
00:44:33.453 --> 00:44:34.913
Someone recommended Martin to me.

552
00:44:34.996 --> 00:44:38.875
I see him every week. Sometimes
we go for dinner or to a concert.


553
00:44:39.251 --> 00:44:41.253
We're good friends, nothing more.

554
00:44:41.378 --> 00:44:43.088
And it was his idea to go scuba-diving?

555
00:44:43.255 --> 00:44:45.465
He said it would be relaxing.

556
00:44:46.508 --> 00:44:48.009
I think he's right.

557
00:44:48.093 --> 00:44:49.469
But he gave up diving?

558
00:44:50.011 --> 00:44:53.348
A good friend of his
had a serious accident in the past.


559
00:44:53.515 --> 00:44:54.683
What sort of accident?

560
00:44:55.142 --> 00:44:57.144
He never wanted to tell me.

561
00:44:57.477 --> 00:44:59.229
But he hasn't been diving since.

562
00:44:59.771 --> 00:45:02.065
He told me he was too busy
with his practice.


563
00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.859
He doesn't like talking about it.

564
00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:06.862
Is he on your list, by any chance?

565
00:45:07.696 --> 00:45:10.031
You're the only one on my list tonight.

566
00:45:13.994 --> 00:45:15.120
Is this OK?

567
00:45:15.203 --> 00:45:17.414
- Where did you get that?
- My dad.


568
00:45:17.497 --> 00:45:18.999
I took it from his pistol this morning.

569
00:45:19.082 --> 00:45:21.543
You were going to try
and get something from the killer.


570
00:45:21.626 --> 00:45:22.919
What did you have in mind?

571
00:45:23.044 --> 00:45:24.337
His passport photo?

572
00:45:24.421 --> 00:45:26.339
The chain is going to be very long.

573
00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:29.342
If you can't do it,
don't be afraid to say so.


574
00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:30.677
I will try.

575
00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:34.097
- Are you sure?
- Just give me the bullet.


576
00:45:54.951 --> 00:45:57.954
Stop it! You're ruining the map.

577
00:46:01.041 --> 00:46:02.042
He is here.

578
00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:18.433
Are you sure this is the right spot?

579
00:46:18.934 --> 00:46:21.228
- Are you scared?
- Not at all.


580
00:46:21.811 --> 00:46:23.396
It's here.

581
00:46:24.689 --> 00:46:27.400
- But what do we do?
- What do you mean?


582
00:46:28.568 --> 00:46:30.487
If we see him?

583
00:46:31.738 --> 00:46:33.031
We'll just grab him, right?

584
00:46:33.114 --> 00:46:36.076
He's super dangerous. 
He's got a knife.

585
00:46:36.284 --> 00:46:39.287
Listen, this was your idea.
You wanted to help your dad.


586
00:46:40.622 --> 00:46:43.708
Don't be scared.
Remember, I go to judo class.


587
00:46:44.876 --> 00:46:45.919
What was that?

588
00:46:46.461 --> 00:46:49.005
- Probably a rat.
- Are there rats here?


589
00:46:50.548 --> 00:46:51.967
Maybe it was him!

590
00:46:52.592 --> 00:46:53.843
You think?

591
00:46:53.969 --> 00:46:55.720
Wait here, if you're that scared.

592
00:46:55.845 --> 00:46:58.932
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to investigate. Be back soon.


593
00:46:59.057 --> 00:47:00.725
Be careful, will you?

594
00:47:14.781 --> 00:47:16.157
Are you OK?

595
00:47:48.773 --> 00:47:52.235
- Filthy, fucking asshole!
- Sorry, I was just joking.


596
00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.072
You and your fucking jokes.
Prick, dickhead...


597
00:48:01.161 --> 00:48:02.329
Get me out!

598
00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:04.331
Are you happy now?

599
00:48:05.206 --> 00:48:06.791
Not so tough now, are we?

600
00:48:07.083 --> 00:48:09.169
Don't just stand there. He's around.
Get me out.


601
00:48:09.252 --> 00:48:10.879
I thought you went to judo class?

602
00:48:10.962 --> 00:48:14.090
- Dammit! Don't be such a pest.
- All right, sucker.


603
00:48:15.258 --> 00:48:18.511
Promise you'll do my math homework
every week from now on.


604
00:48:18.595 --> 00:48:21.014
- Yes, dammit.
- And French. Do you promise?


605
00:48:21.139 --> 00:48:22.182
I promise.

606
00:48:28.355 --> 00:48:29.314
Dammit!

607
00:48:29.397 --> 00:48:30.899
What are you whining for?

608
00:48:30.982 --> 00:48:35.362
If you're clairvoyant, you would've known
you'd tumble into the water.


609
00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.114
You're a big fantasist.

610
00:48:58.426 --> 00:48:59.803
I hope that stain will come out.

611
00:49:00.595 --> 00:49:03.098
If not, I can have a memory
of a great night.


612
00:49:03.681 --> 00:49:04.641
Bye.

613
00:49:04.933 --> 00:49:07.227
Try and stay away
from the canals for now, will you?


614
00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:08.895
Are you concerned about me?

615
00:49:09.604 --> 00:49:10.855
I'd like to see you again.

616
00:49:11.606 --> 00:49:13.983
Call me. Bye.

617
00:49:14.734 --> 00:49:15.819
Bye.

618
00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:28.892
STRICTLY NO ENTRY

619
00:50:29.017 --> 00:50:31.102
I'VE GOT YOU!

620
00:50:31.186 --> 00:50:34.439
POLICE

621
00:50:46.326 --> 00:50:48.703
OK, you've got me.

622
00:50:48.828 --> 00:50:49.871
I give up.

623
00:50:49.996 --> 00:50:52.332
I'm the killer you're looking for.

624
00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:54.626
I'm turning myself in.

625
00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:57.045
It'll cost you at least 20 years, Tinus.

626
00:50:57.253 --> 00:50:59.547
I'm prepared to pay the price.

627
00:51:00.256 --> 00:51:01.508
Have you got any last wishes?

628
00:51:03.468 --> 00:51:04.552
A cup of coffee?

629
00:51:26.533 --> 00:51:29.536
Hey! How long are you planning
on lying there? We have to go.


630
00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.287
I'll come in a minute.

631
00:51:31.412 --> 00:51:33.164
I don't want to be late.

632
00:51:33.289 --> 00:51:34.916
You know what my parents are like.

633
00:52:28.761 --> 00:52:30.305
The mayor is expecting me.

634
00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.181
There you are!

635
00:52:32.265 --> 00:52:35.310
Like I said to the chief superintendent
and the district attorney,


636
00:52:35.393 --> 00:52:38.730
I'm not exactly impressed
with the progress of the investigation.


637
00:52:39.063 --> 00:52:41.608
Is the maniacal killer
in the canals of Amsterdam,


638
00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:44.694
alongside the windmills, the clogs,
and the bulb fields, going to be


639
00:52:44.819 --> 00:52:47.030
a new tourist attraction this summer?

640
00:52:47.155 --> 00:52:48.990
Or is there any
chance we can avoid that?

641
00:52:49.073 --> 00:52:51.993
I understand your concern,
but I assure you


642
00:52:52.118 --> 00:52:55.496
that we are doing everything we can
to stop the killer in his tracks.


643
00:52:55.622 --> 00:52:56.956
I should hope so.

644
00:52:58.416 --> 00:53:01.210
I am wholeheartedly committed
to this city.


645
00:53:01.377 --> 00:53:05.089
There have been times
when our city's reputation wasn't great,


646
00:53:05.173 --> 00:53:06.633
but I can safely say

647
00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:10.470
that we've managed to improve our image
considerably in the past few years.


648
00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:13.514
All the garbage has recently
been removed from the canals,


649
00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.224
and now they are filled with bodies.

650
00:53:15.308 --> 00:53:16.517
Read the newspapers.

651
00:53:16.559 --> 00:53:17.560
Canal Monster Strikes Again

652
00:53:17.644 --> 00:53:19.687
The foreign ones
are also writing about it.


653
00:53:19.771 --> 00:53:22.565
Amsterdam is getting
a bad reputation again.


654
00:53:22.690 --> 00:53:24.984
The law enforcement and police force

655
00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:27.070
are becoming a joke.

656
00:53:27.153 --> 00:53:30.365
As I understand from the superintendent,
we don't expect


657
00:53:30.448 --> 00:53:33.034
any dramatic changes in this case
any time soon.


658
00:53:33.117 --> 00:53:36.037
We are following up a few clues.
These things take time.


659
00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.664
And the supervision of the investigation?

660
00:53:37.747 --> 00:53:39.332
Is it in good hands?

661
00:53:39.457 --> 00:53:42.835
Certainly. Eric Visser
is one of our best people.


662
00:53:43.544 --> 00:53:47.131
Sometimes a new person
can shed a new light.


663
00:53:47.674 --> 00:53:49.842
You had a suggestion, superintendent?

664
00:53:49.926 --> 00:53:54.222
Yes. Eric Visser undoubtedly has
an excellent achievement record,


665
00:53:54.514 --> 00:53:59.143
but the course of the investigation so far
and the lack of results


666
00:54:00.144 --> 00:54:02.146
raise the question

667
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:05.191
whether he is the right man
for this difficult case.


668
00:54:05.441 --> 00:54:07.694
You have several candidates in mind?

669
00:54:08.319 --> 00:54:12.031
There are a few capable people
who could be considered.


670
00:54:12.365 --> 00:54:16.077
- What are your thoughts?
- We shouldn't go looking for a scapegoat.


671
00:54:16.994 --> 00:54:19.622
There are various reasons
why we are stuck.


672
00:54:19.706 --> 00:54:21.416
It has nothing to do with the leadership.

673
00:54:21.499 --> 00:54:24.168
But another person could give an impulse...

674
00:54:24.252 --> 00:54:28.256
I have full confidence in Eric,
and I don't intend to replace anyone.


675
00:54:29.424 --> 00:54:31.926
Fine. That's your prerogative,

676
00:54:32.051 --> 00:54:33.970
and your responsibility.

677
00:54:34.554 --> 00:54:36.264
Let's wait and see.

678
00:54:36.347 --> 00:54:37.932
One to three days.

679
00:54:38.599 --> 00:54:41.978
But if we don't see any results,
I will take action.


680
00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.192
- If he screws up, your head will roll too.
- He won't.


681
00:54:48.693 --> 00:54:49.944
I hope.

682
00:54:55.992 --> 00:54:58.119
How have you been feeling lately?

683
00:54:58.327 --> 00:54:59.662
Not bad.

684
00:55:00.705 --> 00:55:02.790
No depressed moods?

685
00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:04.500
No.

686
00:55:05.251 --> 00:55:08.045
- Are you still sleeping well?
- Yes.


687
00:55:08.379 --> 00:55:10.673
- And you?
- Why do you ask?


688
00:55:11.257 --> 00:55:13.050
You always ask me so many questions.

689
00:55:13.217 --> 00:55:15.052
I'd like to hear
about you for a change.

690
00:55:15.511 --> 00:55:17.096
I am the psychiatrist here.

691
00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:22.059
If I keep doing so well,
you might lose me as a customer.


692
00:55:22.226 --> 00:55:24.729
Is that what you want? To quit?

693
00:55:25.188 --> 00:55:29.400
No. I still enjoy
coming here every week...


694
00:55:30.276 --> 00:55:32.069
To talk a little.

695
00:55:34.363 --> 00:55:35.823
You want to go home so soon?

696
00:55:36.949 --> 00:55:38.367
It's all this lying down.

697
00:55:39.494 --> 00:55:41.037
It's relaxing. 
That's the point.

698
00:55:41.788 --> 00:55:43.247
Do you have a cigarette for me?

699
00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:49.796
Why won't you tell me?

700
00:55:52.215 --> 00:55:54.801
- What?
- You promised not to keep any secrets.


701
00:55:55.635 --> 00:55:57.094
The policeman I met.

702
00:55:57.512 --> 00:56:00.348
- Is he still bothering you?
- He asked me to dinner.


703
00:56:00.681 --> 00:56:01.641
Did you say yes?

704
00:56:02.266 --> 00:56:05.228
Yes. It turned out
to be a great night.

705
00:56:05.728 --> 00:56:09.023
Did he ask you any more questions
concerning those crimes?


706
00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.485
- He didn't say a word about it.
- Then what did he want?


707
00:56:13.903 --> 00:56:15.488
I think he likes me.

708
00:56:16.697 --> 00:56:17.907
What about you?

709
00:56:19.992 --> 00:56:21.244
I think he's nice.

710
00:56:21.744 --> 00:56:23.704
Are you in love?

711
00:56:24.413 --> 00:56:25.998
You're not jealous, are you?

712
00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:28.918
I'm glad you're doing well.

713
00:56:29.001 --> 00:56:31.212
Maybe you really
won't be needing me any more.


714
00:56:52.108 --> 00:56:53.651
I think they're taking it a bit far.

715
00:56:53.734 --> 00:56:56.737
I can think of better things
to do at night. Cigarette?


716
00:56:56.863 --> 00:56:58.239
No, thanks.

717
00:56:58.322 --> 00:57:01.450
Squandering all our overtime
on this nonsense.


718
00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:04.954
As if patrolling does any good.

719
00:57:05.079 --> 00:57:07.123
- Be quiet.
- What's wrong?


720
00:57:07.206 --> 00:57:08.457
I heard a thud.

721
00:57:08.916 --> 00:57:10.167
Turn off the engine.

722
00:57:19.302 --> 00:57:22.513
It was probably some driftwood.
Your nerves are getting the better of you.


723
00:57:22.597 --> 00:57:24.307
He's killed five people.

724
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:27.101
And we might be number six and seven.

725
00:57:27.226 --> 00:57:29.312
- Did you hear that?
- What now?


726
00:57:29.604 --> 00:57:31.689
Aren't you exaggerating a little?

727
00:57:38.362 --> 00:57:39.614
Watch out!

728
00:57:46.621 --> 00:57:48.497
Merry Christmas!

729
00:57:51.083 --> 00:57:53.586
- How certain are we?
- Enough to have a little chat.


730
00:57:53.669 --> 00:57:57.340
- What do we know about him?
- He's worked on a rig in the North Sea.


731
00:57:57.465 --> 00:57:58.883
Two months ago, he got fired.

732
00:57:59.008 --> 00:58:01.218
He would drink a lot and get aggressive.

733
00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:03.346
Last time he assaulted someone
with a broken bottle.


734
00:58:03.429 --> 00:58:04.472
Nice guy.

735
00:58:17.193 --> 00:58:19.528
It's the same kind of rope
they use at his workplace.


736
00:58:19.612 --> 00:58:21.405
The depth gauge could also be a match.

737
00:58:21.489 --> 00:58:22.782
The oil residue is the same.

738
00:58:22.907 --> 00:58:24.992
- The wet suit matches, too.
- Who gave us the tip?


739
00:58:25.076 --> 00:58:28.496
His ex-colleague who met him in the city
last week and thought he


740
00:58:28.579 --> 00:58:30.873
was acting strange.
He was talking about revenge.


741
00:58:30.957 --> 00:58:32.625
Let's go after him.

742
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:33.918
See what he's got to say.

743
00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:50.226
- Where is he?
- In that guest house.


744
00:58:50.518 --> 00:58:52.186
First floor at the front.

745
00:58:52.269 --> 00:58:54.522
- Is he still there?
- We're not sure.


746
00:58:54.605 --> 00:58:57.650
He went in half an hour ago,
but we haven't seen him since.


747
00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:00.653
Hello, Herman, this is Johan.
Still nothing?


748
00:59:00.778 --> 00:59:03.155
No movement so far.

749
00:59:04.198 --> 00:59:06.951
- Maybe he's long gone.
- We'll have to take our chances.


750
00:59:07.034 --> 00:59:09.870
If he's not there,
he knows we're on to him.


751
00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:12.248
We'll take that risk. 
You stay here.

752
00:59:12.331 --> 00:59:13.791
I can never join in the fun.

753
00:59:31.726 --> 00:59:33.436
Hey! What's this?

754
00:59:33.519 --> 00:59:34.687
Police.

755
01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:04.508
He is gone.

756
01:00:22.318 --> 01:00:23.319
Taxi?

757
01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:37.374
Bastards!

758
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.419
He's heading for Leliegracht.
Do we have assistance in the area?


759
01:00:40.669 --> 01:00:42.713
The cavalry confirms receipt.
We're on our way.


760
01:01:56.370 --> 01:01:58.789
BRIDGE OPEN

761
01:01:58.956 --> 01:02:00.082
Idiot!

762
01:02:18.142 --> 01:02:19.977
Are you coming,
or are you just gonna hang there?


763
01:02:28.569 --> 01:02:31.197
You can keep quiet for an hour,
or all night for all I care.


764
01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.782
But it's no use. 
You're not going home.

765
01:02:33.866 --> 01:02:35.951
- I've nothing to do with it, asshole.
- No?


766
01:02:36.035 --> 01:02:37.494
Enlighten me then.

767
01:02:38.245 --> 01:02:40.998
- Drop dead.
- Innocent people don't flee.


768
01:02:41.081 --> 01:02:42.416
Guilty conscience?

769
01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:45.002
Why did you do it? 
Was it revenge?

770
01:02:45.127 --> 01:02:47.588
Is that why you butchered
five innocent people?


771
01:02:49.006 --> 01:02:51.592
- I want a lawyer.
- Listen, asshole.


772
01:02:51.675 --> 01:02:53.761
I've had enough of your games.

773
01:02:53.844 --> 01:02:56.263
What do you think we're doing,
goat fucker?


774
01:03:06.857 --> 01:03:08.108
Your turn.

775
01:03:10.778 --> 01:03:11.904
Right...

776
01:03:13.113 --> 01:03:15.324
You don't want to talk, goat fucker?

777
01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:24.166
- Congratulations.
- Why?


778
01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:25.709
Don't be so modest.

779
01:03:25.793 --> 01:03:28.170
The mayor sends his congratulations.
He's very relieved.


780
01:03:28.295 --> 01:03:29.713
That seems a bit premature.

781
01:03:29.838 --> 01:03:31.382
Why? You caught him, didn't you?

782
01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:34.426
I thought the mayor should be the first
to hear the good news.


783
01:03:34.510 --> 01:03:37.680
We'll have to wait and see if it's
good news. He hasn't confessed yet.


784
01:03:37.763 --> 01:03:40.599
Don't worry. Everything points to him
as the perpetrator.


785
01:03:40.724 --> 01:03:43.811
Your problem is that
you're always such a pessimist.


786
01:04:47.791 --> 01:04:49.084
What are you doing here?

787
01:04:50.794 --> 01:04:52.129
Can I come in?

788
01:04:58.886 --> 01:05:01.096
- Do you know what time it is?
- Way too late.


789
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:04.266
- Were you asleep?
- Like all sensible people.


790
01:05:05.559 --> 01:05:07.519
- Don't worry.
- I wanted to see you.


791
01:05:07.728 --> 01:05:08.812
Did you?

792
01:05:09.063 --> 01:05:10.814
I would send me
away if I were you.

793
01:05:11.648 --> 01:05:13.734
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.


794
01:05:14.109 --> 01:05:15.361
Do you want a drink?

795
01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:17.071
No.

796
01:05:18.322 --> 01:05:20.991
- A sandwich, perhaps?
- Not hungry.


797
01:05:23.994 --> 01:05:27.081
You've arrested someone, haven't you?
I saw it on TV.


798
01:05:27.414 --> 01:05:28.749
That's right.

799
01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:31.293
You don't look too happy.

800
01:05:32.669 --> 01:05:34.088
I don't believe we've got our man.

801
01:05:34.546 --> 01:05:35.839
What are you going to do?

802
01:05:37.007 --> 01:05:38.258
I don't know.

803
01:05:39.134 --> 01:05:40.594
Wait and see.

804
01:05:41.553 --> 01:05:43.514
Are you sure there is nothing
I can do for you?


805
01:07:12.352 --> 01:07:14.480
What's this?

806
01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:19.109
Let's get the lamp out.

807
01:07:22.112 --> 01:07:24.072
Yes.

808
01:07:25.407 --> 01:07:27.826
Put it there.

809
01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:35.083
Such a hassle.

810
01:07:42.633 --> 01:07:44.968
Now what?

811
01:07:45.219 --> 01:07:49.640
What a fuss.

812
01:08:06.949 --> 01:08:08.492
What the heck?

813
01:09:10.095 --> 01:09:11.096
Jesus!

814
01:09:51.386 --> 01:09:53.889
Police? This is Brouwer.

815
01:09:53.972 --> 01:09:55.098
I just saw something weird.

816
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:21.917
- Have you found Eric yet?
- I haven't a clue where he could be.


817
01:10:22.834 --> 01:10:26.505
- He didn't come home last night.
- have my suspicions.


818
01:10:27.589 --> 01:10:29.716
I don't like the
idea of you diving alone.

819
01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:31.843
You think there are more killers
swimming about?


820
01:10:31.968 --> 01:10:34.930
I already told you we're not sure
we have the right guy.


821
01:10:35.013 --> 01:10:36.890
Don't you worry about me.

822
01:10:38.558 --> 01:10:39.726
Is this the right spot?

823
01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:42.270
The boat should be here.
The grapnels are there.


824
01:10:42.312 --> 01:10:43.313
All right.

825
01:10:43.814 --> 01:10:45.524
Let's have a look then.

826
01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:25.689
How can you tell if something is wrong?

827
01:11:25.772 --> 01:11:26.982
We jerk at the rope.

828
01:11:27.107 --> 01:11:29.109
One jerk: everything is fine.

829
01:11:29.192 --> 01:11:31.069
Five jerks is an SOS.

830
01:12:02.058 --> 01:12:03.643
He's in the boat now.

831
01:12:03.769 --> 01:12:04.811
How do you know?

832
01:12:04.895 --> 01:12:06.646
- The bubbles.
- Which bubbles?


833
01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:09.649
The air bubbles have gone.
They're heaping together in the boat.


834
01:12:09.733 --> 01:12:11.234
Oh yes, of course.

835
01:12:34.216 --> 01:12:35.258
FEDERAL POLICE

836
01:12:35.342 --> 01:12:36.426
What's happening?

837
01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:37.594
I don't know.

838
01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:41.723
Everything is fine.

839
01:13:03.203 --> 01:13:04.162
Is that normal?

840
01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:18.218
Haul him up.

841
01:13:22.889 --> 01:13:24.474
He's stuck.

842
01:13:43.743 --> 01:13:44.828
Haul him up. Quick!

843
01:13:47.664 --> 01:13:50.208
- It's too late! He's gone.
- Pull him aboard, dammit!


844
01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:56.047
There he goes.

845
01:13:56.464 --> 01:13:58.717
The air bubbles over there. That's him!

846
01:13:59.217 --> 01:14:00.969
Chase those air bubbles. It's him.

847
01:14:15.150 --> 01:14:16.818
Hello, 302. Do you receive me?

848
01:14:42.344 --> 01:14:43.929
- We've got him.
- How do you mean?


849
01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.388
He's heading towards the lock.

850
01:14:48.058 --> 01:14:49.976
We have to close it from this side.

851
01:15:33.311 --> 01:15:35.772
Right, we've got him.

852
01:15:36.314 --> 01:15:37.774
Right under those bubbles.

853
01:16:12.767 --> 01:16:14.310
Where have you been?

854
01:16:14.644 --> 01:16:15.770
John?

855
01:16:16.646 --> 01:16:18.189
They've taken him away.

856
01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:19.733
We tried to reach you, but...

857
01:16:19.816 --> 01:16:22.652
- He shouldn't have gone diving alone.
- I couldn't stop him.


858
01:16:23.695 --> 01:16:24.946
It's not your fault.

859
01:16:29.617 --> 01:16:30.910
At least we caught him.

860
01:16:30.994 --> 01:16:32.120
Platoon, get ready!

861
01:16:32.203 --> 01:16:34.330
We've trapped him.

862
01:16:35.498 --> 01:16:37.292
Those air bubbles?

863
01:16:38.668 --> 01:16:40.545
I think he knows he's finished.

864
01:16:40.628 --> 01:16:43.840
He hasn't moved an inch.
He knows it's over.


865
01:16:43.923 --> 01:16:45.633
- He hasn't moved?
- No.


866
01:16:53.349 --> 01:16:54.684
Not long now!

867
01:16:55.226 --> 01:16:56.561
Aim!

868
01:17:08.698 --> 01:17:10.909
Dammit!

869
01:17:29.385 --> 01:17:32.013
I'm sorry. I should've known
he would never swim into the lock.


870
01:17:32.097 --> 01:17:33.890
He's smart. He makes us look like fools.

871
01:17:34.015 --> 01:17:36.392
Meanwhile he's had
plenty of time to escape.


872
01:17:36.684 --> 01:17:39.229
Hello, 504. This is HB. 
Do you receive me?

873
01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:40.730
Hello, HB. This is 504.

874
01:17:40.855 --> 01:17:44.734
Hi, Hans. Someone has broken into a shed
at the Amstel dock.


875
01:17:44.818 --> 01:17:47.028
It's probably the diver
you're looking for.


876
01:17:47.112 --> 01:17:48.238
We're on our way.

877
01:18:04.212 --> 01:18:05.672
- He's in that shed.
- What's he doing?


878
01:18:05.755 --> 01:18:07.423
No idea, but I
think he's still in there.

879
01:19:00.476 --> 01:19:01.519
- Everything OK?
- Yes.


880
01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:03.271
He must be hurt.

881
01:19:24.959 --> 01:19:27.503
- How do I start this thing?
- Press the red button, and give the gun.


882
01:19:36.930 --> 01:19:38.181
Goddammit!

883
01:19:51.986 --> 01:19:53.863
Row! One, two.

884
01:19:54.155 --> 01:19:56.616
Put the helm to port!

885
01:19:59.327 --> 01:20:00.536
Jerk!

886
01:20:59.929 --> 01:21:01.848
PASSAGE OBSTRUCTED

887
01:23:15.606 --> 01:23:17.108
There's the bastard!

888
01:23:17.942 --> 01:23:19.694
HB, this is 306. 
Do you receive me?

889
01:23:33.166 --> 01:23:34.167
Watch out!

890
01:23:39.881 --> 01:23:41.257
Shit! Fuck!

891
01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:43.676
Goddammit! Jerk!

892
01:27:37.201 --> 01:27:38.619
THE AMSTEL
YACHT-BASIN


893
01:29:03.287 --> 01:29:04.288
He's coming round.

894
01:29:07.708 --> 01:29:09.126
What are you doing here?

895
01:29:09.210 --> 01:29:10.628
I was in the area.

896
01:29:11.462 --> 01:29:13.839
How are you? Are you in pain?

897
01:29:14.757 --> 01:29:16.217
Did you catch him?

898
01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:19.428
When we finally found you,
he was long gone.


899
01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:21.722
What time is it?

900
01:29:21.806 --> 01:29:24.225
Where is Anneke?

901
01:29:24.308 --> 01:29:25.643
Staying with a school friend.

902
01:29:26.352 --> 01:29:29.522
Willy. What time is it?

903
01:29:29.855 --> 01:29:31.190
1 o'clock in the morning.

904
01:29:32.525 --> 01:29:34.151
Time flies when you're having fun.

905
01:29:35.778 --> 01:29:38.405
I shot him. Right in his diving goggles.

906
01:29:38.489 --> 01:29:42.409
We found some fragments.
We don't know if you actually hit him.


907
01:29:42.827 --> 01:29:45.579
I have to get cracking. 
No time to waste.

908
01:29:46.914 --> 01:29:50.042
You'll have to stay here for now.
It's not serious.


909
01:29:50.125 --> 01:29:52.169
The dart only grazed the bone.

910
01:29:52.545 --> 01:29:54.547
The doctor says
you need to rest a few days.


911
01:29:54.630 --> 01:29:55.923
Jesus!

912
01:29:57.049 --> 01:29:58.551
How are you, Mr. Visser?

913
01:29:58.843 --> 01:30:00.761
Excellent, thanks.

914
01:30:01.011 --> 01:30:03.764
You were lucky.
Everything is going to be OK.


915
01:30:04.056 --> 01:30:06.809
Those stitches can come
out in a few days.

916
01:30:06.892 --> 01:30:10.563
It looks like
you'll just have a small scar.


917
01:30:12.690 --> 01:30:14.733
You better go. 
The patient needs to rest.

918
01:30:14.859 --> 01:30:17.319
I wanted to discuss
a few things with him.

919
01:30:17.403 --> 01:30:19.613
That will be difficult.
I just gave him a sedative.


920
01:30:19.864 --> 01:30:22.283
He won't be able to talk
for the next 12 hours.


921
01:30:22.408 --> 01:30:24.451
All right. I'll come back tomorrow.

922
01:30:24.535 --> 01:30:26.495
- Can I give you a lift?
- Yes, please.


923
01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:03.657
It's you! Sir isn't here yet.

924
01:31:03.782 --> 01:31:05.117
I know. I'm a little early.

925
01:31:05.242 --> 01:31:08.162
Make yourself at home. I have to go.

926
01:31:08.245 --> 01:31:09.747
My mother's stomach is playing up.

927
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:11.248
Nothing serious, I hope?

928
01:31:11.332 --> 01:31:12.666
Too many toffees.

929
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:14.418
She always eats too many.

930
01:31:14.501 --> 01:31:17.338
I can tell her not to all I want,
but she won't listen.


931
01:31:17.463 --> 01:31:18.964
And now she's ill.

932
01:31:19.048 --> 01:31:21.508
- Wish her a speedy recovery for me.
- I will.


933
01:31:21.926 --> 01:31:24.428
Have a sherry while you wait.

934
01:31:24.553 --> 01:31:26.096
I had one, too.

935
01:33:57.039 --> 01:33:58.832
You're not playing games with me, are you?

936
01:34:06.882 --> 01:34:07.925
SALVATION ARMY

937
01:34:10.761 --> 01:34:13.013
Is this one of your new therapies?

938
01:35:15.492 --> 01:35:17.327
Hello, this is the Surgery Ward.

939
01:35:18.412 --> 01:35:20.038
Who would you like to speak to?

940
01:35:21.331 --> 01:35:22.708
Mr. Visser?

941
01:35:22.833 --> 01:35:24.585
It's very important.
I have to speak to him.


942
01:35:24.668 --> 01:35:26.503
OK, I will have a look.

943
01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:48.734
I'm sorry, but Mr. Visser is still asleep.
Can I pass on a message?


944
01:35:48.859 --> 01:35:50.694
Tell him Laura called.

945
01:35:50.903 --> 01:35:51.945
Yes, Laura.

946
01:36:02.331 --> 01:36:04.374
And tell him that the one
they're looking for...


947
01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:05.959
Just a moment. 
My pen is not working.

948
01:36:06.668 --> 01:36:08.253
Hurry up!

949
01:36:08.378 --> 01:36:11.006
It's really important.
You need to warn Eric.


950
01:36:11.089 --> 01:36:12.507
I know who it is.

951
01:36:23.518 --> 01:36:24.728
Hello, madam?

952
01:37:19.157 --> 01:37:22.369
- Hello, kids.
- We're here to see Eric Visser.


953
01:37:24.496 --> 01:37:26.081
Third floor.

954
01:37:26.164 --> 01:37:27.624
Room 316.

955
01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:29.418
I told you he'd still be here.

956
01:37:29.501 --> 01:37:30.711
But I saw it, honest.

957
01:37:30.794 --> 01:37:33.005
Just keep your mouth shut.

958
01:37:33.088 --> 01:37:34.798
I only want to warn him.

959
01:37:34.881 --> 01:37:37.634
How could he be
in danger in the hospital?

960
01:37:38.093 --> 01:37:39.594
Maybe he's not staying long.

961
01:37:39.678 --> 01:37:41.847
Four days, the doctor said.

962
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:43.640
You'll find I'm right.

963
01:37:43.765 --> 01:37:45.058
I know these things.

964
01:37:45.183 --> 01:37:49.688
You'd better be careful
you don't fall in the water again.


965
01:37:51.815 --> 01:37:54.151
- From the guys.
- How kind of them.


966
01:37:54.234 --> 01:37:56.320
And a clean set of clothes.

967
01:37:56.528 --> 01:37:57.904
Any news?

968
01:37:58.113 --> 01:38:00.949
I'm afraid I have
nothing to cheer you up.

969
01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:03.994
Do you mind if I take an apple?
I'm starving.


970
01:38:04.077 --> 01:38:05.537
Be my guest.

971
01:38:07.622 --> 01:38:09.541
Someone phoned, asking for you.

972
01:38:09.624 --> 01:38:10.584
Who?

973
01:38:10.667 --> 01:38:12.502
A lady. Someone called Laura.

974
01:38:12.627 --> 01:38:13.587
What did she want?

975
01:38:13.670 --> 01:38:15.464
It was a bit odd. 
She hung up suddenly.

976
01:38:15.547 --> 01:38:16.631
She didn't say anything?

977
01:38:16.757 --> 01:38:19.092
It was rather vague.
She said something like...


978
01:38:19.176 --> 01:38:22.596
you were looking for someone,
and that she knew who. Then she hung up.


979
01:38:22.679 --> 01:38:24.723
- She sounded a bit incoherent.
- When did she call?


980
01:38:24.848 --> 01:38:26.058
About ten minutes ago.

981
01:38:26.141 --> 01:38:27.267
Why didn't you tell me?

982
01:38:27.351 --> 01:38:28.393
You were still asleep.

983
01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:30.645
- Where did she phone from?
- She didn't say.


984
01:38:32.064 --> 01:38:33.106
It's Wednesday, right?

985
01:38:33.190 --> 01:38:34.691
Yes, the 24th.

986
01:38:34.775 --> 01:38:36.318
What time is it?

987
01:38:36.401 --> 01:38:38.695
- About half past 5.
- Mr. Visser, what are you doing?


988
01:38:38.779 --> 01:38:40.447
What's the matter?

989
01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:41.698
Hurry, or we'll be late.

990
01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:43.950
- Late for what?
- Mr. Visser!


991
01:38:44.076 --> 01:38:46.244
- Hi, Dad!
- Daddy has to pop out.


992
01:38:46.328 --> 01:38:48.121
- Where are you going?
- I'll tell you later.


993
01:40:15.542 --> 01:40:18.211
- Can you finally tell me what's going on?
- Can't it go faster?


994
01:40:18.295 --> 01:40:20.213
This is a new car.
I'm still breaking it in.


995
01:40:20.839 --> 01:40:22.007
Are you crazy?

996
01:42:29.509 --> 01:42:32.012
It's OK. Everything is OK.

997
01:42:41.563 --> 01:42:43.064
I believe that won't be necessary.

998
01:42:46.651 --> 01:42:48.820
I thought it was you!

999
01:42:53.199 --> 01:42:56.036
Inform the station.
We could use some backup.


1000
01:43:00.624 --> 01:43:03.501
I believe you have some explaining to do.

1001
01:43:58.390 --> 01:44:01.142
We've been friends since our youth.
We used to do everything together.


1002
01:44:01.226 --> 01:44:03.561
We also started diving together.

1003
01:44:03.978 --> 01:44:07.732
He went on to make a living out of it,
working for a salvage company.


1004
01:44:07.857 --> 01:44:09.025
What happened?

1005
01:44:10.610 --> 01:44:11.903
Three years ago,

1006
01:44:11.986 --> 01:44:16.700
a ship in the North Sea lost several
containers with chemical agents.


1007
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:20.161
He was one of the people to recover them.
They said it was harmless stuff.


1008
01:44:20.245 --> 01:44:21.579
What was in it?

1009
01:44:21.663 --> 01:44:23.998
Uranium hexafluoride.

1010
01:44:24.082 --> 01:44:25.709
But they forgot to mention it.

1011
01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:27.043
Who are "they"?

1012
01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:30.130
A state-owned enterprise
involving senior officials.


1013
01:44:30.755 --> 01:44:31.923
Did it go wrong?

1014
01:44:32.006 --> 01:44:34.551
They called it "an unfortunate accident."

1015
01:44:34.926 --> 01:44:38.263
One of the containers
had burst open under water.


1016
01:44:38.638 --> 01:44:41.725
I didn't recognize him any longer.
His face had been deformed.


1017
01:44:41.808 --> 01:44:44.811
The stuff was so radioactive
it messed with his brain.


1018
01:44:44.936 --> 01:44:47.188
He became increasingly erratic.
There was nothing I could do.


1019
01:45:48.666 --> 01:45:51.544
He withdrew from everyone.

1020
01:45:53.421 --> 01:45:56.674
The fun was over for me. I quit diving.
I couldn't do it any more.


1021
01:45:58.009 --> 01:46:00.303
I went to see him a few times.
I tried to help him.


1022
01:46:00.428 --> 01:46:02.847
A few months ago, he asked
if he could borrow my diving gear.


1023
01:46:02.931 --> 01:46:05.433
He'd got rid of his. 
Of course I said yes.

1024
01:46:05.725 --> 01:46:08.686
I wanted him to be happy.
I let him use all my stuff.


1025
01:46:09.354 --> 01:46:10.855
I had no idea what his intentions were.

1026
01:46:10.980 --> 01:46:12.816
Avenging himself against society.

1027
01:46:13.107 --> 01:46:15.193
Murdering innocent people.

1028
01:46:15.735 --> 01:46:18.780
I didn't want to believe it. He's sick.

1029
01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:20.323
Extremely sick.

1030
01:46:21.074 --> 01:46:22.200
We're nearly there.

1031
01:47:13.334 --> 01:47:15.086
He's in there. 
But don't hurry.

1032
01:47:15.211 --> 01:47:16.838
He won't ever go underground again.

1033
01:47:34.522 --> 01:47:36.024
Shouldn't we be getting back?

1034
01:47:36.107 --> 01:47:37.483
Your daughter might be worried.

1035
01:47:37.567 --> 01:47:39.152
She can take care of herself.

1036
01:47:39.277 --> 01:47:40.612
I've booked a table.

1037
01:47:41.487 --> 01:47:44.532
For three,
by candlelight at a fish restaurant.


1038
01:47:45.617 --> 01:47:48.077
- A fish restaurant?
- Don't you like fish?


1039
01:47:48.661 --> 01:47:49.662
No.

1040
01:47:50.079 --> 01:47:52.498
I don't like anything
that comes out of the water, to be honest.


1041
01:47:52.624 --> 01:47:54.459
I came out of the water, remember?

1042
01:47:54.584 --> 01:47:56.294
I'll make an exception for you.

1043
01:48:02.175 --> 01:48:03.593
You joker!
