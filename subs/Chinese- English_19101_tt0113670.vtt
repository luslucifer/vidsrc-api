很久很久以前
A very long time ago...

在一塊名叫印度的神秘土地

她嫁給了英俊的王子拉瑪
She was married to the handsome Prince Rama...


8
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.930
王子被惡毒的繼母凱伊皇后

9
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.180
流放到這座森林里來

11
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.530
西塔公主在森林里看見一只受傷的小鹿
...Princess Sita saw a wounded deer in the woods...


12
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.830
她肯求拉瑪王子去救它
...and she begged Rama to go and help it.


13
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.210
王子在地上畫了個圈  對公主說
Rama drew a circle in the ground and said to her:


14
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.620
這是一個魔法圈
"This is a magic circle.


15
00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.460
只要你不離開它
So long as you stay inside it...


16

惡魔就不能傷害你

救救我
Help me.


19
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.140
她以為是心愛的拉瑪王子有危險
Thinking it was her beloved Rama in danger...


20
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.150
于是跑出圈循著聲音跑去
...the princess ran from the circle to answer the cry.


21
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.240
不久遇見了一位年邁的乞丐
She soon came across an old beggar man.


22
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.750
盡管身無分文
Although she had no money to give him...


23
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.580
公主不忍心拒絕老人的哀求
...she could not refuse his plea.


24
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.090
就把自己的手鐲給了他
As soon as he had the bracelet...


25
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.670
就在這時乞丐變成了十頭怪獸  拉瓦納
...he transformed into the 10-headed demon, Ravana.

可我為什么非得去美國

知道嗎  我們離開房問  她就變活了
And did you know, when we leave them alone in our room, they come to life?


137
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.370
-真的  -當然
-They do?  -Yes.


138
00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.870
我們進來前她又會變成洋娃娃  快得像閃電
Before we walk in, they quickly return to their places. Quick likes light!


139
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.210
她為什么不在我們面前活過來
Why don't they come to life in front of us so that we can see them?


140
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.380
因為這是魔法
Because it's magic.


141
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:38.970
你要相信它
Magic has to be believed.


142
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.890
這樣才能顯靈
That's the only way it's real.


143
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.640
你害怕時  想我時
Whenever you're afraid, or miss me terribly...


144
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:49.640
就告訴愛米麗
...just tell Emily.


145
00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.150
不管我在哪里她都會告訴我
She'll get the message to me, wherever I am.


146
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:58.070
我會馬上給你回信
And I'll send one back right away...


147
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:00.490
你摟著愛米麗
...so when you hug her...


148
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.410
就像摟著我一樣
...you'll be getting a hug from me.


149
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.250
我答應你  爸爸
It's all right, Papa.


150
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.260
我會好好的
I'm going to be fine.


151
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.600
你在做什么
What are you doing?


152
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.100
用心記住我
Memorizing me by heart?


153
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.530
你早已在我心里了
No, I already know you by heart.


154
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.550
再見  小公主
Goodbye princess.


155
00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.510
昨晚怎么那么吵
What was that noise last night?


156
00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.750
有人哭了幾個小時
Somebody was crying for hours.


157
00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.500
那算什么  你應該聽聽喬瑟芬打呼嚕
That's nothing. You should hear Josephine snore.


158
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.090
我不打呼嚕
I do not!


159
00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.430
她是誰  -那個新來的女孩
-Who was it?  -The new girl?


160
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:49.930
她還沒出過她的房問  你見過她的玩具嗎
She hasn't come out of her room yet. Did you see all her toys?


161
00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:51.770
給我你的絲帶
I want your hair ribbon.


162
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:55.350
她父親制造餅干之類的  他們很有錢
Her father grows crackers or something. They're very rich.


163
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:58.520
那當然  我認識的每個人都喜歡吃餅干
They must be. Everyone I know eats crackers.


164
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:03.360
她父親是英國人  聽說跟國王和王后是好朋友
Her father's British. I hear he's best friends with the king and queen.


165
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:05.700
聽說他被流放到印度
Well, I hear he was thrown out of India...


166
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:08.590
因為他做有毒的餅干害死許多人
...because people died from eating his poisoned crackers.


167
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.240
有毒的餅干
Poisoned crackers?


168
00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:11.870
有毒的餅干
Poisoned crackers?


169
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.960
我姨媽是吃了有毒的豆子死了
My aunt once died from eating poisoned string beans.


170
00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:19.130
-誰在乎你姨媽  -就是  誰在乎
-Who cares about her?  -Yeah, who cares?


171
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:26.270
我們進來前她又會變成娃娃
But before we walk in and catch them, they return to their places,


172
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.390
快得像閃電
quick as lightning.


173
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.050
天哪  真夠快的
Gosh, she's fast.


174
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:43.730
媽媽
Mama.


175
00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.900
莎拉
Sara?


176
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.070
不能因為一個人耽誤大家的早餐
We are not customed to delay everyone's breakfast for one student.


177
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.740
對不起  可我
I'm sorry, Miss Minchin, but I found my mama...


178
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:55.250
記住  你不是這里唯一的孩子
You're not the only child here, Sara, you have to remember that.


179
00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.590
早安
Yes, yes, yes, good morning.


180
00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.340
記得昨天來的那位小姐嗎
I trust you remember our newest pupil from our visit to class yesterday.


181
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.510
莎拉  這位是杜弗吉先生
Sara, this is Monsieur Dufarge.


182
00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:11.010
今天下午你向他學習法語
You willl begin French lessons with him this afternoon.


183
00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.010
我非得學嗎
Do I have to?


184
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.270
你當然非學不可
Sara, you most certainly do.


185
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.440
為你的失禮向杜弗吉先生道歉
Now apologize to Monsieur this instance for your rudeness.


186
00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:21.360
-對不起  我不是想冒犯他  -道歉
-But I didn't mean to be rude.  -Now!


187
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:42.880
這孩子不需要再學法語了  她說得很好
This child doesn't need to learn French. She practically is French!


188
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.460
她的法語很好  跟他爸爸學的
She learned from her father.


189
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.880
我非常清楚她說什么
I understood perfectly well what she said, Monsieur.


190
00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:49.300
我們想告訴您的
I'm sorry.  But we tried to tell you.


191
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.050
她可以去教小一點的孩子
Well, perhaps She can tutor the younger children...


192
00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.720
或許她還能幫您糾正發音
...and just be able to help you with your pronunciation, Miss Minchin.


193
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.310
我聞到的是香腸味嗎
Are those sausages I smell?


194
00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.080
謝謝
Thank you.


195
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:19.160
餐桌上不許講話
Sara, there's no talking at the table.


196
00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.670
這不正常
Doesn't seem natural.


197
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:26.500
我不想再重復
I won't say it again.


198
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.350
7乘以5是35
Seven times five is 35.


199
00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.520
7乘以6是42
Seven times six is 42.


200
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.520
7乘以7是49
Seven times seven is 49.


201
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.440
7乘以8是
Seven times eight is...


202
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:47.110
58
...58.


203
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.700
不  等等  54
No, wait. 54?


204
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.120
55

205
00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.120
72  93  還是12
Or 72? Or 93? Or 12?


206
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.700
對不起  米切思小姐
I'm sorry, Miss Minchin.


207
00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.710
昨晚我背了幾個小時
I studied for hours last night.


208
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.960
我簡直不敢相信
I find that very hard to believe.


209
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.500
我想你父親應該知道這些
And I imagine your father will as well.


210
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:09.960
求你別告訴他
Please don't tell him, Miss Minchin.


211
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.220
我保證下次會做對
I promise I'll do better.


212
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.180
求你了
Please.


213
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:15.890
拉維妮亞  你來算
Lavinia, you may continue.


214
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.560
7乘以8是56
Seven times eight is 56.


215
00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.810
7乘以9
Seven times nine...


216
00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.060
是63
...is 63.


217
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.240
親愛的爸爸
Dear Papa:


218
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.160
我已經開始想你了
I miss you already.


219
00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.200
這里一切都好
Things are fine.


220
00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:43.500
只是我沒想到學校有這么多規矩
Except I never imagined there would be so many rules at school.


221
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.080
我想它們存在一定有道理
I guess they're there for a purpose...


222
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.590
我正努力去遵守
...and I'm trying hard to obey them.


223
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.840
但我還是覺得我做錯了什么
But I get the feeling I'm doing something wrong.


224
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.860
再見  爸爸
Goodbye, Father.


225
00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:13.990
再見  我的孩子
Bye, son.


226
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:30.880
希望你讀這封信的時候
I hope when you read this...


227
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.050
臉上帶著微笑  心里充滿快樂
...it kindles your heart and puts a smile on your face.


228
00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:39.800
我真的為你驕傲  每時每刻都在思念著你
Papa, I'm so proud of you. And I think about you every moment.


229
00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:42.140
永遠永遠愛你
And I love you forever.


230
00:19:42.810 --> 00:19:44.480
你的莎拉
Your Sara.


231
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.660
洛蒂  再別鬧了
Lottie, you mustn't get so excited.


232
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:01.490
洛蒂  親愛的
Lottie? Precious?


233
00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:05.830
求你了  洛蒂寶貝  別再叫了
Oh, please, Lottie dear! Please stop screaming!


234
00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.080
想不想吃餅干  要吃嗎
How about a cookie? Would you like that?


235
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:12.170
我去給你拿
I'll get a cookie.


236
00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.680
你這樣鬧別人都沒法學習了
It's very hard to study with you carrying on like this.


237
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.020
我要媽媽
I want my mama!


238
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:26.600
你很快就會見到她
You'll see her soon.


239
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:31.560
不會  她死了  我再見不到她了
No, I won't. She's dead, and I won't ever see her again!


240
00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.030
我也沒有媽媽
Well, I don't have a mother either.


241
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:39.490
是嗎
You don't?


242
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.280
她在哪
Where is she?


243
00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:45.370
在天堂  和我小妹妹在一起
In heaven with my baby sister.


244
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.290
這不意味著我不能和她說話
That doesn't mean I can't talk to her.


245
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:52.130
我什么都跟她說  我知道她聽得見
I tell her everything, I know she hears me.


246
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.790
怎么會
How?


247
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:56.710
因為天使都能聽見
Because that's what angels do.


248
00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.880
-你媽媽是天使  -當然
-Your mama's an angel?  -Of course.


249
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:04.060
你的媽媽也是 有美麗的絲翅膀
And so is yours. With beautiful wings of silk...


250
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.350
戴著玫瑰花冠
...and a crown of baby rosebuds.


251
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.310
她們都住在城堡里
And they all live together in a castle.


252
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.650
知道城堡是什么造的嗎
Do you know what it's made of?


253
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.270
是向日葵
Sunflowers...


254
00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:18.070
幾千朵向日葵像黃金一般閃著光芒
...hundreds of them, so bright they shine like gold.


255
00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.410
天使們想去什么地方
When the angels want to go someplace...


256
00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.160
就吹口哨  像這樣
...they just whistle, like this.


257
00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:35.170
云彩飛到城堡大門帶上她們
And a cloud floats to the castle and picks them up.


258
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.760
天使飛向天空
As the angels fly through the sky...


259
00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.260
就像坐著魔毯
...riding the cloud like a magic carpet...


260
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.510
在月光下穿梭于星星之問
...under the moon and through the stars...


261
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.440
直至飛到我們頭頂上
...until they're hovering right above us.


262
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:58.030
她們在天上注視著我們是否快樂
That's how they can look down and see if we're all right.


263
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.780
有時她們會給我們捎話
And sometimes they even send messages to us.


264
00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.190
你這樣又哭又鬧
Of course, you can't hear the messages


265
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.870
就聽不見她們說什么了
if you're kicking and screaming as loudly as you were.


266
00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.880
不過她們會再說好幾遍  怕我們沒聽見
But they always try again, just in case we've missed it.


267
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:20.970
等等
Hey, wait!


268
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.640
那是貝琪  她不能跟我們講話
That's Becky. She's not allowed to talk to us.


269
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:27.010
為什么
Why not?


270
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:30.640
她是女傭而且是個黑人
She's a servant girl, and she has dark skin.


271
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:32.390
那又怎么樣
So?


272
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.810
這還不夠嗎
Well, doesn't that mean something?


273
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:22.030
對不起  我不是
I'm sorry, I...


274
00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.530
需要我為你做什么  小姐
Is there anything I can do for you, miss?


275
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.700
我只是上樓來換鞋
I just came up here to change my shoes.


276
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.780
不  沒什么
No, there's nothing.


277
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:34.870
請原諒  可你待在這里我們都會有麻煩
Well, then begging your pardon, but we'll both be in trouble if you stay.


278
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:42.800
好了  姑娘們  排好隊
All right, girls, pair up.


279
00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.720
排好隊
Pair up.


280
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.850
<b>親愛的貝琪  希望我們能成為朋友  莎拉</b>

281
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.520
愛德華爵士看見女兒眼里的憂傷
"Sir Edward saw the sorrow in his daughter's eyes...


282
00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:44.940
但他知道家族榮譽是首要的
...but he knew that family honor must prevail at all costs.


283
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.700
貴族身份不能被忽視
Nobility was not thought to be trifled with.


284
00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.620
"我向你求婚  夏洛特"  他說
'I beg of you, Charlotte,' he said.


285
00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.450
"答應約翰爵士春天嫁給他"
'Marry Sir John in the spring, as he has asked.'


286
00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.290
謝謝  拉維妮亞
Thank you, Lavinia.


287
00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.710
莎拉  你接著讀
Sara, you may take your turn.


288
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:13.050
夏洛特轉過身對父親說  "父親  你是對的"
"Charlotte turned to her father and said, 'Father, you are right.


289
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.810
"我必須打消那愚蠢瘋狂幼稚的想法"
'I must put away my foolish fancies and childhood wishes.'


290
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.990
但我不想那么做
But I simply won't do it.


291
00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.740
對不起  父親
I'm sorry, Father.


292
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:32.740
我不能嫁給我不愛的人
When I marry, it'll be for love.


293
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.410
說著  夏洛特沖出房子
And with that, Charlotte ran from the house.


294
00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:39.500
在外面等待她的是英俊的馬夫  皮埃爾
Waiting outside was the handsome stable boy, Pierre...


295
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:41.500
夏洛特心愛的王子
...whom Charlotte secretly adored.


296
00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.340
他們逃到海邊
Together they escaped to the coast


297
00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.750
坐船去塔帝島
and quickly set sail to the island for Tahiti.


298
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.730
途中遭到
But when they were halfway there,


299
00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:51.760
一幫海盜的襲擊
their ship was attacked by band of pirates!


300
00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:54.260
不想被活著吃掉
Rather than be eaten alive...


301
00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:57.350
夏洛特和皮埃爾跳進洶涌的大海
...Charlotte and Pierre threw themselves into the raging sea.


302
00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:59.180
在他們將要被淹沒時
As they began to drown...


303
00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:03.440
緊緊擁抱著山盟海誓
...they held each other close, and swore undying love.


304
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:09.530
絕望之際一群美人魚出現
But then, when all seemed lost, a group of mermaids appeared and rescued...


305
00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:10.860
別說了
Stop!


306
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.370
你在干什么
What are you doing?


307
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.630
我不忍心看她嫁給那個人
I couldn't bear to see Charlotte marry that man,


308
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.540
就想像了另一個結局
so I imagined a different ending.


309
00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:23.870
你想像的
Imagined it?


310
00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:27.550
您從來不這樣嗎
Don't you ever do that, Miss Minchin?


311
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.050
相信某種東西  讓它像是真的
Believe in something, just to make it seem real?


312
00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.890
什么都不缺的孩子才會想像
That's easy for a child who has everything.


313
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.140
學校里不允許想像
There will be no more make-believe at this school...


314
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:43.230
閱讀時間或其他時間都不允許
...during reading or any other time.


315
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.560
-明白了嗎  -是  米切思小姐
-Is that understood?  -Yes, Miss Minchin.


316
00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.900
都回房間去
All of you, go to your bed this instant.


317
00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:56.740
我從沒聽過這么好聽的故事
I never heard a story like that in my whole life.


318
00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.750
你一定知道很多故事  對嗎  莎拉
I...I bet you know lots of them, don't you, Sara?


319
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.920
不許說話
I want silence up there!


320
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.920
我們得想法怎么對付這些規矩
We have to do something about this communication rule.


321
00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.260
等米切思小姐睡著后
Hey, after Minchin goes to bed...


322
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:16.430
我們去你房間聽你給我們講故事
...we'll sneak into your room, and you can tell us a real story is.


323
00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.260
行嗎  莎拉
How about it, Sara?


324
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:20.600
只能你們三個人來
Only if it's just you three.


325
00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.210
快來  快來
Come on, come on.


326
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:13.230
怪獸拉瓦納把公主鎖在魔宮的塔樓上
The evil Ravana locked the princess up in his palace tower.


327
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.650
好幾個星期
There she stayed for many weeks...


328
00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.320
公主看著窗外
...just staring out her window...


329
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:20.990
非常思念她的王子
...missing her Prince Rama terribly.


330
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.100
你真漂亮  就像愛米麗
Perfect. You look just like Emily.


331
00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.940
我父親討厭洋娃娃  他不愿意來看我
My father hates dolls. And he hates coming here.


332
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.190
說他不屬于這里
Says he doesn't belong.


333
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.530
那他為什么送你來
Then why does he send you?


334
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:57.450
他想給我找個地方住
Because he wants me to belong.


335
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.730
我的小女兒  她會說法語  她真的會說法語
My little girl. She spoke French! She really spoke French.


336
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:37.990
我和你母親為你自豪
Your mother and I are very proud of you.


337
00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.750
我抓到你了
I caught you, Nellie!


338
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:15.440
爸爸
Papa!


339
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:07.240
蘭道夫  喬思
Randolph... John!


340
00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.000
拉瑪王子向魔宮走去
Rama approached the thorny palace...


341
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:16.920
他不知道怪獸拉瓦納正在等著他
...unaware that Ravana was waiting for him.


342
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.930
好了  我受夠了
That's it! I can't take it anymore!


343
00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.270
我才不管你說什么
I don't care what you say about Sara's stories.


344
00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.100
她的故事比看你梳頭有趣得多
They' ve got to be more fun than watching your hair being combed!


345
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:42.110
如果還有人這么想  可以馬上走
If anyone else feels the same way, I think she should leave too.


346
00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.790
怪獸拉瓦納還沒出來
But the evil Ravana was not through yet.


347
00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:04.800
這次它舉起一張弓和十枝箭
This one, he took a bow that could hold, not one, but 10 arrows...


348
00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.130
每枝箭頭上都抹了毒藥
...each filled with the deadly poison.


349
00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.550
箭劃破長空
The arrows sped through the air...


350
00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.640
對準王子飛過來
...heading straight for Rama.


351
00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.560
箭射到地上
And the arrows hit the ground...


352
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:19.900
放出毒氣  冒出一股黃色的濃煙
...and released their poison, giant clouds of thick, yellow smoke.


353
00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.550
-我想要一塊大的蛋糕  -快點  洛蒂
-I want a big piece!  -Oh, hush up, Lottie.


354
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.890
莎拉公主會很公平
I am sure "Princess" Sara will give everyone a fair share.


355
00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.890
對嗎  公主
Right, Princess?


356
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.810
我告訴她你是公主
I told her that's what you were.


357
00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.230
不只是我  所有女孩都是公主
Well, not just me. All girls are princesses.


358
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.900
包括像你一樣壞脾氣的女孩
Even snotty, two-faced bullies like you, Lavinia.


359
00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.250
拉維妮亞  給你一塊大的
Here, Lavinia, you get a big piece.


360
00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:14.870
米切思小姐
Miss Minchin?


361
00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:16.680
是的  有什么事嗎
Yes, may I help you?


362
00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:18.600
我叫巴洛
I'm Mr. Barrow.


363
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.940
是克魯上尉的律師
Captain Crewe's solicitor.


364
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.520
請進來吧
Oh, yes, do come in.


365
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.870
我們正在為莎拉慶祝生日
We're just celebrating little Sara's birthday.


366
00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.530
能和您私下談談嗎
May I speak to you in private?


367
00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.450
當然可以  請跟我來
Oh, yes, of course. Right this way.


368
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:13.820
您看見了  莎拉在這里很受歡迎
May I just say is about that Sara is quite the favorite around here.


369
00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.910
我們為她的生日做了精心準備
We went to great lengths to make this a special day for her.


370
00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.430
恐怕這個月的支票數額會很大
I'm afraid your check to us this month will be rather large.


371
00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:38.850
不會再有支票了  米切思小姐
There will be no check, Miss Minchin.


372
00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.020
您說什么
Excuse me?


373
00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.990
生日聚會結束  你們立即回自己房間去
The party is over! I want everyone go to their rooms, this instant!


374
00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.200
可是我們
But Miss Minchin, we...


375
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.410
莎拉  你留下
Sara, you will stay behind.


376
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.160
有件事要告訴你
I have something to tell you.


377
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.330
快走
Move!


378
00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:56.470
愛米麗亞  到莎拉房間找件黑衣服
Amelia, go to Sara's room and find a simple black dress.


379
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.050
要是沒有合適的  先借一件
If nothing is suitable, borrow one from other girls.


380
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.510
-可是  姐姐  -按我說的去做
-But, sister, I...  -Do as I say.


381
00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.780
我為什么需要黑衣服
Why would I need a black dress, Miss Minchin?


382
00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:33.130
因為有個壞消息  莎拉
I'm afraid I have some bad news, Sara.


383
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:36.840
你父親
Your father has...


384
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:40.760
你父親
Your father...


385
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:46.390
你父親已經死了
It's been discovered that your father has died.


386
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.980
幾個星期前他陣亡了
He was killed in battle several weeks ago.


387
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:53.270
我很遺憾
I'm sorry.


388
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.100
但這是事實
That's the reality, the situation,


389
00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.150
無人能改變
and there's nothing anyone can do to change it.


390
00:38:00.910 --> 00:38:04.600
還有  英國政府沒收了他的公司
What's more, the British government has seized control of his company


391
00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:05.830
和所有財產
and all of his assets...


392
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.500
沒給你留下一分錢
...leaving you penniless, without any money.


393
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:14.130
你沒有別的親戚  這讓我很為難
And since you've no relations, this puts me in a terrible position.


394
00:38:16.590 --> 00:38:18.300
你看什么
What are you staring at?


395
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:21.840
不明白我的話嗎
Don't you understand what I'm saying?


396
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:24.850
你現在在這世上無依無靠
You are alone in the world...


397
00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:31.270
只有我可憐你決定讓你留在這里
...unless I decide to keep you here out of charity.


398
00:38:43.110 --> 00:38:44.770
你欠了債
Because of the expenses you've incurred,


399
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:47.240
你所有東西都歸我了
everything you own now belongs to me...


400
00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:50.290
你的衣服  玩具  所有東西
...your clothes, your toys, everything.


401
00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.880
但這還不足以彌補我的損失
But they'll hardly make up for the financial losses I've suffered.


402
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:58.210
從現在起你必須自己養活自己
From now on, you must earn your room and board here.


403
00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.840
搬到閣樓上和貝琪一塊住  現在你是傭人
You'll move to the attic with Becky and work as a servant.


404
00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.010
你要是不好好地干活
If you fail to meet the standards in this institution...


405
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.390
或是不老實  我就把你趕出去
...or if you don't do as told, you'll be thrown out.


406
00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.780
相信我
Believe me, Sara,


407
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:14.650
這個城市的街道不會可憐你這種小乞丐
the streets of this city are not kind to homeless beggars.


408
00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:23.200
早上5點到廚房去干活
Report to Mabel in the kitchen promptly at 5 a.m.


409
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:29.330
帶著這個你會被抓起來
I could you'll be arrested for taking this.


410
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.250
你很走運我把那洋娃娃留給你
You're lucky I let you keep that doll.


411
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.460
書也給你
You may have the book.


412
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:40.340
再出這種事我就叫警察
But another incident like this and I will call the authorities.


413
00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.930
你要記住  莎拉·克魯
I expect you to remember, Sara Crewe...


414
00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.720
你不再是公主了
...you're not a princess any longer.


415
00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.250
爸爸
Papa.


416
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.350
爸爸
Papa.


417
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:11.360
爸爸
Papa.


418
00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.100
爸爸
Papa.


419
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.940
爸爸  回來吧
Papa, please.


420
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.450
爸爸
Papa.


421
00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.480
莎拉  怎么了
Sara, what happened?


422
00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:09.990
伺候小姐不必說話  明白嗎
You're to serve the girls without conversation, you understand?


423
00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:14.080
今后莎拉是這里的傭人
Sara will be working here as a servant from now on.


424
00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:18.080
你們不許和她說話  知道了嗎
There will be no communication exchange. Is that clear?


425
00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:20.580
是  米切思小姐
Yes, Miss Minchin.


426
00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.850
7乘以5是35
Seven times five is 35.


427
00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.690
7乘以6是42
Seven times six is 42.


428
00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:27.820
放開我
Let go!


429
00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:09.940
我的天
Great God!


430
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:11.360
這不是真的
It can't be!


431
00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.440
是我兒子  喬思
It's my son, John!


432
00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:14.950
天哪  不
Dear God, no.


433
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.280
不是喬思
Not John.


434
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.450
是喬思  拉姆·戴斯
It's John, Ram Dass!


435
00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.870
是喬思  幫幫我
It's John. Help me.


436
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:23.500
-進去吧  -幫我
-Come inside.  -Help.


437
00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.550
我以為你睡著了
On, I thought you'd be sleeping.


438
00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:43.060
我還沒機會送你生日禮物
I never got a chance to give you your birthday present.


439
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.730
這是你住過的地方
It's a picture of where you used to live.


440
00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.730
看這藍色的線  這是河
See the blue threads? That's the river.


441
00:44:52.690 --> 00:44:55.650
這些是你常常提起的山
These are the mountains you always talk about.


442
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.240
貝琪  謝謝你
Thank you, Becky.


443
00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.530
它太美了
It's beautiful.


444
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.980
莎拉
Sara


445
00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:07.830
你怎么不再講故事了
Why don't you tell stories anymore?


446
00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:12.590
那都是想像  沒有任何意義
They're just make-believe. They don't mean anything.


447
00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.630
但對我很有意義
On, but they've always meant something to me.


448
00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.600
有時我覺得如果聽不到你那些神奇的故事我會死
Some days I thought I'd die, until I heard you talk about the magic.


449
00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.720
世界上沒有什么神奇的故事
There is no magic, Becky.


450
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:46.790
爸爸
Papa...


451
00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:50.210
你聽到了嗎
...can you hear me?


452
00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.710
我好害伯
I'm so scared.


453
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:35.670
你還是公主嗎
Are you still a princess?


454
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:40.420
你快回去吧  不然我們都有惹麻煩
You better get back in line or we'll both be in trouble.


455
00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.510
你還是嗎
Are you?


456
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:42.510
洛蒂
Lottie!


457
00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:46.850
姑娘們  排好隊
All right, girls, get in line.


458
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.210
別碰那個
Don't touch that!


459
00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.210
那是給隔壁蘭道夫先生的
It's for Mr. Randolph, next door.


460
00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:20.550
可憐的老人  他兒子在歐洲犧牲了
The poor man. His son is missing in action in Europe.


461
00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:23.880
你說喬思  他是個好孩子
You mean John? He's such a nice boy.


462
00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:38.480
給  小姑娘
Here, little girl.


463
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:41.740
我跟你說過別給乞丐錢
I told you not to give your money away.


464
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:48.080
對不起  等一等
Excuse me. Excuse me.


465
00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.910
看見了吧  他們最會纏人
You see? You never get rid of them.


466
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:57.500
你要買什么
May I help you?


467
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:03.840
要花嗎  請買朵花吧
Would you like to buy a flower?


468
00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:07.180
買花吧
Would you like to buy a flower?


469
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:09.180
-你要花嗎  -今天不要
-Would you?  -Not today.


470
00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:13.770
你要買花嗎
Sir, would you like to buy a flower?


471
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.280
請買朵花吧
Would you?


472
00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:37.250
先生  請買朵花吧
Would you like a flower, sir?


473
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:38.080
讓一讓
Pardon me.


474
00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:39.540
您要花嗎
Would you like a flower?


475
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:47.970
送她一朵花
Give her a flower.


476
00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.720
等等
Wait!


477
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:58.560
送給小公主
For the princess.


478
00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.000
你怎么了  小老鼠
What is it, little mouse?


479
00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:41.580
你也是個囚犯嗎
Are you a prisoner too?


480
00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:48.760
你來的那個地方也這么冷嗎
Is it ever this cold where you come from?


481
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:50.760
不
No.


482
00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:56.600
跟我說說  莎拉  再給我講講印度
Tell me about it, Sara. Tell me again about India.


483
00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:03.690
印度
India.


484
00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:05.440
講吧
Tell me.


485
00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.530
好吧
Well...


486
00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.950
那里的空氣非常熱
...the air is so hot there...


487
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:14.620
你似乎能嘗到那味道
...you can almost taste it.


488
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.620
那滋味一定像椰子
I bet it tastes like coconuts.


489
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:22.620
不  更像香料
No, it's more like spices, really.


490
00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:25.290
咖哩和番紅花
Curry and saffron.


491
00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:27.300
還有什么
What else?


492
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:34.800
老虎在樹下睡覺
Tigers sleep under trees...


493
00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.220
大象在湖里洗澡納涼
...and elephants cool themselves in the lakes.


494
00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:43.060
暖風吹過原野
The warm wind blows through the fields...


495
00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.900
精靈們乘著風
...and the spirits ride it...


496
00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.150
唱著歌在天上注視著我們
...singing as they look down on us.


497
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:53.150
她們的聲音在山谷問回蕩
Their voices echo through the mountains...


498
00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:55.410
天空
...and the sky...


499
00:51:55.660 --> 00:51:57.580
呈現出繽紛色彩
...is all different colors...


500
00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:01.250
像孔雀羽毛
...like a peacock's tail.


501
00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:10.120
把煤煙灰弄得到處都是  愚貨
Soot all over the place, you clumsy fool!


502
00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:11.290
滾
Get out!


503
00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:13.290
馬上滾出去
Get out of my house!


504
00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:16.550
這星期別指望能拿到一分錢
And you can forget being paid this week!


505
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:18.720
忘思負義的小東西
Ungrateful little wretch.


506
00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.640
別向我要錢
No, you don't!


507
00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:23.890
我說過屋里不許有一點煤灰
I told I won't tolerate any soot in this house!


508
00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:28.140
看看我的靴子  全被搞臟了
And there, just look at my boot! It's filthy!


509
00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:30.140
快滾
Out!


510
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:34.400
拿上你的破玩意滾吧
Out! And take this ridiculous-looking thing with you!


511
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.880
愛米麗亞小姐在哪
Where, where might Miss Amelia be this morning?


512
00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:47.560
早安  法蘭西斯  你今天來得真早
Good morning, Frances. You're here early this morning.


513
00:55:47.810 --> 00:55:52.230
男人想有成就必須勤快一些
A working man gets up early if he wants to have an effect on the world.


514
00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.730
說得對
How true.


515
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:57.150
你的精神令人欽佩  法蘭西斯
And what a powerful effect you have, Frances.


516
00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.520
你去哪了
Where have you been?


517
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:44.030
我已經被凍了半個鐘頭了  快把火點上
I've been chilled for half an hour. Hurry up and light a fire.


518
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:47.700
別用你的臟手碰任何東西
And don't touch anything else with your dirty hands.


519
00:56:48.030 --> 00:56:52.040
現在這房間是我的了  不準你把它弄臟了
This is my room now, and I won't have you messing it up.


520
00:56:56.620 --> 00:56:59.250
這是什么味道真惡心
What is that awful smell?


521
00:56:59.250 --> 00:57:01.630
你上次洗澡是什么時候
When was your last time you had a bath?


522
00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:10.970
你在干什么
What are you doing?


523
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:13.390
我不相信這一套
I don't believe in this!


524
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:17.560
你快停下  停下
So you can just stop it! Stop it, I said!


525
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.070
那是什么意思
What did you just do?


526
00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:27.070
幾句跟印度女巫學的咒話
Just a little curse I learned from a witch in India.


527
00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.570
咒語
Curse?


528
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:33.660
-什么樣的咒語  -你會知道的
-What kind of curse?  -You'll see.


529
00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:37.830
不過我要是你就不那樣梳頭
But I wouldn't brush my hair as much if I were you.


530
00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:53.430
過來吧  這是我專門為你留的
It's all right. I saved it especially for you.


531
00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.520
來吧  吃吧
Go on. Take it.


532
00:58:23.290 --> 00:58:25.210
你就住在這里
Is this where you live?


533
00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:29.220
你不該來  這太冒險了
You shouldn't be here. It's too dangerous.


534
00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:34.140
為什么你不再喜歡我了  我做錯了什么嗎
Sara, why don't you like me anymore? Did I do something wrong?


535
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:36.220
沒有  當然沒有
No, of course not.


536
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:39.980
我以為你們不想再和我交朋友
I didn't think you'd want me for a friend...


537
00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:42.740
畢竟一切都變了
...now that things are different.


538
00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:47.400
我知道你沒有我這個朋友也很好
Sara, no, I'm sure you could do just fine without me for a friend...


539
00:58:47.650 --> 00:58:50.490
可我不能沒有你
...but I couldn't get along without you.


540
00:58:52.070 --> 00:58:53.660
對不起  我應該想到
I'm sorry. I should've known...


541
00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.490
你和別人不同
...you wouldn't be like the others.


542
00:58:56.740 --> 00:58:59.660
-什么聲音  -敲一聲表示"我在這里"
-What's that?  -One knock means "I'm here."


543
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:03.830
敲兩聲表示"一切都好"
Two knocks means "All is well."


544
00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.090
敲三聲就是"沒有危險"
Three means "The coast is clear."


545
00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:09.370
"米切思女巫已經睡了"
'The demon Minchinweed is asleep.'


546
00:59:09.370 --> 00:59:12.010
這太刺激了
Gosh! It all sounds so adventurous!


547
00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:14.930
貝琪  來客人了
Look, Becky. We have a visitor.


548
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:17.100
你好  貝琪
Hello, Becky.


549
00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:21.020
莎拉  我太想聽你講故事了
Oh, Sara, I miss your stories so much.


550
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.610
告訴我們公主和王子后來怎樣了
Won't you tell us what happened to Rama and the princess?


551
00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:28.440
黃色的毒煙
The smoke from Ravana's arrows...


552
00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:31.030
終于散開
...finally began to lift.


553
00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.950
拉瑪倒在地上一動也不動
Rama lay dead on the ground.


554
00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:35.950
不
Oh, no!


555
00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:39.040
但是神奇的事發生了
But then a wonderful thing happened.


556
00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:44.960
一只羚羊來到王子身邊  用自己的生命救活了他
The gazelle laid down next to Rama, giving him his own life.


557
00:59:56.970 --> 00:59:59.310
他患有暫時性失憶癥
He's suffering from cute amnesia...


558
00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.560
是毒氣彈的副作用
...one of the rare side effects of poison gas.


559
01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:05.060
他的視力很快就會恢復
His eyes will heal in time.


560
01:00:05.310 --> 01:00:07.900
他的記憶就很難說了
His memory... who can say?


561
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:09.730
他不是我兒子
He's not my son.


562
01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:14.070
很抱歉  蘭道夫先生
I'm sorry, Mr. Randolph.


563
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:16.740
他被發現時身受重傷
He was found in severe shock...


564
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:19.660
沒有軍服  沒有證件
...with no coat, no identification.


565
01:00:20.490 --> 01:00:23.500
因為只有您兒子還沒找到
Since your son was the only name unaccounted for...


566
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.080
所以他們認為這是喬思
...they assumed this was John.


567
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:29.500
很對不起
I am sorry.


568
01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.100
沒希望了  你認為我是個傻瓜
All the hoping. You must think me a fool.


569
01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.690
您希望自己是個聰明人  主人
Is it your wish to be wise, sahib?


570
01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.520
我不知道
I don't know.


571
01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.030
一個聰明人根本不會來這里
I suppose a wise man wouldn't have come here at all.


572
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.610
聰明人
But if he had...


573
01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:57.370
會再仔細看看這位軍官
...he would have looked closely upon the soldier's face.


574
01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:00.950
能看出什么
What would he have seen?


575
01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.210
痛苦  先生  他需要照顧
Pain, sahib. He needs to be cared for.


576
01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:08.630
這不是我的責任
He's not my responsibility.


577
01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:13.130
聰明人記得他和喬思在一個軍團
A wise man would remember that this soldior was in John's regiment.


578
01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:18.470
如果他恢復記憶或許能告訴先生
If his memory returns, he might tell us what happened to his son.


579
01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:24.810
喬思正在英國某醫院里
Perhaps sahib will learn that John is in British hospital...


580
01:01:25.060 --> 01:01:30.230
等待著好心人幫他脫離痛苦  帶他回家
...wishing that a kind man would take him home, away from his pain.


581
01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:37.990
管道工來了  告訴他哪壞了
If the plumber comes, show him the problem.


582
01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:41.490
別和他聊天  他可是計時收費
And don't babble with this man. He's paid by the hour.


583
01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:45.080
我回來之前把拉丁文試卷判好
And make sure to correct the Latin tests by the time I get back.


584
01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:46.580
是  姐姐
Yes, sister.


585
01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:54.170
您好  米切思小姐
Hello, Miss Minchin.


586
01:01:55.590 --> 01:01:57.010
再見  米切思小姐
Goodbye, Miss Minchin.


587
01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:25.950
不  別這樣
Oh, no, not again!


588
01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.790
洛蒂  別這樣
Lottie, not again.


589
01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:54.820
快找那條項鍵
Let's find the locket.


590
01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:58.320
好了
All right...


591
01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.490
別鬧了
...it's okay. It's all right.


592
01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:33.520
我想洛蒂中邪了
Sara, come quick! It's Lottie, I think Lottie's possessed.


593
01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:05.890
找到了
I got it.


594
01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:14.730
你去管住那個小東西好嗎
Will you please get that child under control?


595
01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:16.900
別擔心  一切都好
Don't worry. Everything's fine.


596
01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.430
你怎么了
Well, what is it?


597
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.430
我想我看見了老鼠
I thought I saw a mouse.


598
01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:14.870
你好
Hello.


599
01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:26.800
那孩子是撤旦派來折磨我的
I swear, that child has a pact with Satan to destroy me.


600
01:05:27.050 --> 01:05:29.800
這工作不適合我  我沒有耐心
I'm not cut out for this job. I have no patience for children.


601
01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:33.140
教書要記住那么多可怕的東西
And teaching! All those horrible facts to remember.


602
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:34.980
我簡直煩透了
I don't like it at all.


603
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:37.650
你喜歡法蘭西斯  是嗎
You like Frances, don't you?


604
01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:38.980
什么
What?


605
01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.320
當然不是  你怎么敢這么說
Of course not. How dare you.


606
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.990
我想他也喜歡你
I think he likes you too.


607
01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.240
是嗎
You do?


608
01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.320
真的
Really?


609
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:52.490
你們應該遠走高飛去結婚
I think you should run away and get married.


610
01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:55.000
這該有多浪漫
It'd be terribly romantic.


611
01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:58.330
多么令人激動
What an extraordinary thing to say.


612
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:12.100
可是我姐姐知道了會大發雷雷
Well, anyway, my sister would be furious if she found out.


613
01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:15.020
那時你早走遠了
So, you'd be long gone by then.


614
01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:17.850
和勇敢的法蘭西斯一起
Living in some exotic paradise...


615
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.020
生活在你們的伊甸園里
...with that dashing young milkman.


616
01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.190
我得去集市了
I'd better get to the market.


617
01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.380
你做得很好  年輕人
You're doing well, young man.


618
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:51.390
你馬上就到家了
You're almost home.


619
01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:56.640
請相信我的眼睛  主人
You must trust my eyes, sahib.


620
01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.250
怎么回事
What's going on?


621
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:27.760
一個驚喜
It's a surprise.


622
01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.850
-你們怎么來了  -我們給你帶來樣東西
-What are you doing here?  - We brought you something.


623
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:44.110
莎拉公主  我們為你找回了一件東西
Princess Sara, we like to present you with something we rescued.


624
01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:46.440
歷經驚心動魄的歷險
In a dangerous adventure.


625
01:07:46.690 --> 01:07:49.780
-我們自己的軍事行動  -冒著生命危險
-Our very own crusade.  -Risking all our lives.


626
01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.450
還有我
And mine too.


627
01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:02.210
我不知道該說什么
I don't know what to say.


628
01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:09.050
你們是我最好的朋友
You are the best friends anyone could ever ask for.


629
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.970
沒事的  這是我的小朋友  漢納曼
It's all right. It's just my little monkey friend, Hanuman.


630
01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:20.470
他是從哪來的
Where did he come from?


631
01:08:20.890 --> 01:08:22.730
就是隔壁  看
Right next door. Look.


632
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:25.980
漢納曼喜歡來做客
Hanuman likes to come to visit me all the time.


633
01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:28.650
你能和他說話嗎
Can you really talk to him, Sara?


634
01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:29.650
當然
Sure!


635
01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:33.240
漢納曼  跟我的朋友們打個招呼
Hanuman, say hello to all my friends.


636
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:57.120
拉瑪醒來后
After Rama came back to life...


637
01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:01.600
跑到怪獸的魔宮去救公主
...he raced towards the monster's palace to rescue Sita.


638
01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:02.850
可是突然
Suddenly...


639
01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:05.350
拉瓦納出現了
...Ravana appeared!


640
01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:23.370
我們還是以后再接著講吧
I think we better save the rest of the story for later.


641
01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:42.970
你們在這里干什么
What's going on here?


642
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:45.890
不是她們的錯  是我叫她們來的
It's not their fault. I asked them to come.


643
01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.730
你們五個立即下樓
You five go downstairs immediately.


644
01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:49.480
以后再處理
I'll deal with you later.


645
01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:51.820
貝琪
Becky...


646
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.020
你明天關在自己的屋里
...you'll remain locked in your room for the entire day tomorrow


647
01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:56.070
別想吃飯
without meals.


648
01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.320
快走
Go!


649
01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.000
她的活也歸你干
And you will perform all her chores in addition to your own...


650
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:06.750
并且沒有早餐  午餐和晚餐
...without breakfast, lunch or dinner.


651
01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.500
你應該明白
It's time you learned, Sara Crewe...


652
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:12.590
現實生活不是你幻想的故事
...that real life has nothing to do with your fantasy games.


653
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:15.420
這是個殘酷骯臟的世界
It's a cruel, nasty world out there...


654
01:10:15.670 --> 01:10:18.430
我們的責任就是盡量做到最好
...and it's our duty to make the best of it.


655
01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:23.760
不要沉浸在愚蠢的幻想中  而是讓自己成為有用的人
Not to indulge in ridiculous dreams, but to be productive and useful.


656
01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.940
聽明白我的話了嗎
Do you understand what I'm saying?


657
01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:34.030
是的  女士
Yes, ma'am.


658
01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:37.610
很好
Good.


659
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:42.950
可我并不相信
But I don't believe in it.


660
01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:49.120
別跟我說你仍舊是什么公主
Don't tell me you still fancy yourself a princess.


661
01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.630
上帝  看看你周圍
Good God, child, look around you!


662
01:10:53.130 --> 01:10:55.800
去照照鏡子
Or better yet, look in the mirror.


663
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:05.140
我是公主
I am a princess.


664
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:06.970
所有的女孩都是
All girls are.


665
01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:10.060
即使她們住在窄小的閣樓上
Even if they live in tiny old attics.


666
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:12.650
即使她們穿得破破爛爛
Even if they dress in rags.


667
01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:16.980
即使她們不漂亮不聰明不再年輕
Even if they aren't pretty or smart or young.


668
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.110
她們還是公主  我們全都是
They're still princesses. All of us.


669
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.910
您父親沒有告訴過你
Didn't your father ever tell you that?


670
01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:26.870
他沒有嗎
Didn't he?


671
01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:33.670
我再發現你和別的女孩在這里
If I find you up here with any other girls again...


672
01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.500
就把你扔到街上去
...I'll throw you out into the street!


673
01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.660
我們該怎么辦
What're we going to do?


674
01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.420
整天都會沒有飯吃
A whole day with nothing to eat.


675
01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.710
貝琪  別哭
Don't cry, Becky.


676
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:19.710
我很害伯
I'm scared.


677
01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.470
如果米切思把我趕走  我沒有地方可去
If Minchin throws me out, I've got no place to go.


678
01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.220
放心吧
That's not true.


679
01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:31.310
我會陪著你  我一直覺得我們是姐妹
I'm here with you. I've always thought of us as sisters.


680
01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:33.310
是真的
You have?


681
01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:37.060
我們發誓永遠照顧對方
Let's make a promise riight now to always look out for each other.


682
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.480
我發誓
It's a promise.


683
01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.570
現在怎么能找點吃的呢
Now, what are we going to do about food?


684
01:12:45.410 --> 01:12:47.160
我們會餓死的
Starve, I guess.


685
01:12:47.410 --> 01:12:50.580
不會  我們要做一件事
No, there's only one thing to do.


686
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:53.920
睡覺前吃一頓豐盛的晚宴
We'll eat a great feast before we go to sleep...


687
01:12:54.170 --> 01:12:56.420
這樣明天就不會覺得餓
...and that will keep us full all day tomorrow.


688
01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:59.500
晚宴  什么晚宴
Feast? What feast?


689
01:12:59.710 --> 01:13:01.590
你看
Just look around.


690
01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.590
看見那邊的桌子了嗎
Do you see that table there?


691
01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.470
鋪著潔白的臺布
It's covered with a beautiful cloth...


692
01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.930
還有蠟燭
...and candles...


693
01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:12.020
托盤里放著各種美味可口的食物
...and trays of good things to eat.


694
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:15.100
來吧  貝琪
Come on, Becky.


695
01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:18.480
告訴我那上面都有什么
Tell me what kind of food there is.


696
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:21.570
可我什么也沒看見
But I don't see any food.


697
01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:23.530
試試看  貝琪
Try, Becky.


698
01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:27.530
想像那里有  記得你對我說的話嗎
Just make-believe it. Remember what you told me?


699
01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.450
神奇的魔法
About the magic?


700
01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.920
-小松餅  -很好  什么樣的
-Muffins?  -Good! What kind?


701
01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:43.800
各種各樣的
All kinds.


702
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:48.640
都是最好的  還是熱的呢
Every kind of muffin God ever made, and all of them hot.


703
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:50.300
很好
Good!


704
01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.230
可我們沒有漂亮衣服參加晚宴
But we're not dressed right for such an elegant banquet.


705
01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:03.400
我披著有毛領的紫色絲絨披肩
I'm wearing a long velvet cape with fur on the collar.


706
01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:04.740
你呢
How about you?


707
01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:08.070
我喜歡鉆石
Well, I always liked diamonds myself.


708
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:12.910
耳環  戒指  裙子上鑲滿鉆石
Rings and bracelets, and a whole dress covered with them.


709
01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.250
那些香腸的味好香
Smell those sausages!


710
01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.250
我喜歡香腸
I love sausages.


711
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:46.870
貝琪  貝琪
Becky! Becky!


712
01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.300
天哪
Oh, my Lord!


713
01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.680
你實在是太神奇了
I think you went a little too far this time.


714
01:15:57.930 --> 01:15:59.430
不是我
It wasn't me.


715
01:16:04.230 --> 01:16:05.690
穿上吧
Go ahead.


716
01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:22.370
我們像是遇見天使了
I feel like I've been touched by an angel.


717
01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.540
看
Look!


718
01:16:23.870 --> 01:16:25.380
正是我們點的菜
Just what we ordered.


719
01:16:26.130 --> 01:16:28.210
這讓我有些害伯
I'm a little scared about all of this.


720
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.720
我也是  這東西能吃嗎
Me too. Do you think we shouldn't eat it?


721
01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.430
我還沒怕到這地步
I'm not that scared.


722
01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:50.320
謝謝你照顧我  給你們添麻煩了
Thank you for all your kindness. I'm so sorry to inconvenience you.


723
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:51.900
這沒什么  主人
It is nothing, sahib.


724
01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:58.950
這話
That word...


725
01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.830
聽起來很耳熟
It sounds so familiar...


726
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.580
可我不知道它的意思
...yet I don't know what it means.


727
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:10.420
這不是英語  我們曾經用過
It is not English. We use it where I am from.


728
01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.550
在印度
In India.


729
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:16.430
印度
India...


730
01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.100
您懂印度語
You know it?


731
01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:22.430
不
No.


732
01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.770
一切都那么模糊
Everything's just a blur.


733
01:17:29.230 --> 01:17:31.440
也許有一天我會想起來
Maybe someday I'll sort it out.


734
01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:33.900
您會的  主人
You will, sahib.


735
01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.780
你會的
You will.


736
01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:34.960
你好
Yoo-hoo?


737
01:18:49.470 --> 01:18:52.050
法蘭西斯
Hey! Frances!


738
01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:55.030
等一等
One minute.


739
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:21.800
我的天
Oh, my God.


740
01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:26.580
法蘭西斯
Frances!


741
01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.980
它在哪
Where is it?


742
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:38.820
項鏈在哪
Where's the locket?


743
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:40.820
把它給我  把它給我
Give it to me! Give it to me!


744
01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:45.660
這是什么
What is all this?


745
01:19:46.990 --> 01:19:48.160
從哪來的
Where'd it come from?


746
01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:50.750
我不知道  一覺醒來就有了
I don't know. I just woke up and it was here.


747
01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:54.280
是你偷來的  就像你偷了這項鏈
You stole it, didn't you? Just like you stole this locket!


748
01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.120
不
No!


749
01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:57.000
你是個骯臟的小賊
You're nothing but a dirty little thief.


750
01:19:57.510 --> 01:20:00.030
我有責任保護這里所有孩子
It's my responsibility to protect the children in this school


751
01:20:00.030 --> 01:20:01.930
不讓她們受你的影響
from animals like you.


752
01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:02.830
但是
But Miss Minchin...


753
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:05.850
收拾東西  警察會馬上把你帶走
Pick your things. You'll be leaving with the police very shortly!


754
01:20:07.930 --> 01:20:09.770
不  米切思小姐
No, Miss Minchin!


755
01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:11.890
我沒偷東西
I didn't do it.


756
01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.360
米切思小姐  我沒偷東西
Miss Minchin, please!


757
01:20:14.610 --> 01:20:17.150
真的沒有
Miss Minchin, I didn't do it!


758
01:20:31.710 --> 01:20:35.130
我說了  你要馬上把她帶走
You heard me. I want her picked up immediately!


759
01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:56.190
你把繃帶取下來了
You've removed the bandages.


760
01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:59.480
不再需要了  我的視力已經恢復
I didn't see there wasn't much point. I can see all right.


761
01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.650
進來喝杯白蘭地
That's well, come on in, have a brandy.


762
01:21:17.250 --> 01:21:18.840
別擔心
Don't worry.


763
01:21:19.670 --> 01:21:21.920
他們會相信你的
I'm sure they'll believe you.


764
01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:25.590
不  我得逃出去
No, Becky! I have to get out.


765
01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:29.260
怎么逃  我的房間也被鎖上了
But how? My room's locked too.


766
01:21:42.940 --> 01:21:44.150
警察來了
The police, they're here!


767
01:21:46.530 --> 01:21:49.330
快點  上樓去
Let's go, boys. Step lively now.


768
01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.130
快來幫幫我
Quick, help me with this board!


769
01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.680
-這邊  -是  女士
-Right this way.  -Yes, madam.


770
01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.070
你會掉下去
You'll fall!


771
01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.820
我能過去
I can do it.


772
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:31.740
我會回來接你
I'll come back for you. I promise.


773
01:22:59.230 --> 01:23:00.940
她要干什么
What is she doing?


774
01:23:01.690 --> 01:23:03.190
你給我回來
Get back in here!


775
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:34.970
-那個小畜牲想溜  -我們會抓住
-The little beast is running away!  -We're trying, miss.


776
01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.030
我的天
Good God!


777
01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.770
別光站在這里  快去隔壁抓她
Well, don't just stand there! Go next door and find her!


778
01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.860
你們最好把她也帶走
And take this one while you're at it.


779
01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:44.710
我昨晚聽見你在夢里喊叫
I heard you calling in your sleep last night.


780
01:24:45.210 --> 01:24:49.210
我有時候做夢  夢見我身體的一部分不見了
Sometimes when I dream, I sense a part of me that's missing.


781
01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.130
很奇怪我心里總有樣東西
It's strange, feeling having your heart remember


782
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:53.630
可腦子想不起是什么
something your mind can't.


783
01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:59.220
見到一個小孩跳過來嗎
She jumped like a little animal.


784
01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:04.560
這個時候會是誰
Who's that at this hour?


785
01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.400
讓我們進去
Let us in, man.


786
01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:14.990
學校的一個孩子躲藏進了您家
A child from the school has escaped in your house.


787
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.410
怎么回事
Ram Dass, what's going on here?


788
01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:19.330
打擾了  可有個孩子藏進你家
I'm sorry to interupt you, but there's a child hiding in your house.


789
01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.250
-什么  -到樓上去搜
-What?  -Search upstairs.


790
01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:26.420
現在不行
Oh, not now!


791
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:28.590
拿蠟燭來
Ram Dass, get some candles!


792
01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:35.180
-從閣樓開始搜  -開始
-Start with the attic.  -Let's go.


793
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:36.430
快點
Quickly!


794
01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:39.930
是誰在那里
Who's there?


795
01:25:56.450 --> 01:26:00.160
檢查柜子  還有床底下
Make sure you check the closets and under the beds!


796
01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:07.630
怎么了
What is it?


797
01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:09.710
為什么哭
Why are you crying?


798
01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:17.220
告訴我  我不會傷害你
Please tell me. I won't hurt you.


799
01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:20.970
告訴我你叫什么名字
Won't you tell me your name?


800
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:30.540
莎拉
Sara.


801
01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:33.200
莎拉
Sara.


802
01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:39.730
多好聽的名字  莎拉
That's such a pretty name. Sara.


803
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:53.000
爸爸
Papa.


804
01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:02.630
爸爸
Papa.


805
01:27:02.630 --> 01:27:03.930
你說什么
What did you say?


806
01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:05.700
爸爸
Papa.


807
01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:08.440
-對不起  -爸爸  是我
-I'm sorry.  -Papa, it's me, Sara.


808
01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:09.850
你不認識我了嗎
Sara, do you know me?


809
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:11.520
你不記得我了嗎
Oh god papa, don't you remember me?


810
01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:15.380
爸爸是我  你一定記得我  我是莎拉
