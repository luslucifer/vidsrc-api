00:00:11.057 --> 00:00:13.726
My first time ever performing
in Atlanta, Georgia.


2
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.896
I was picked up from the airport
by a Black comedian in a Lexus,


3
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.691
which was a rare car
to see a Black dude in,


4
00:00:19.774 --> 00:00:21.776
especially one that told jokes
for a living.


5
00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:25.530
And we went to a comedy club
that he was a part owner in.


6
00:00:25.613 --> 00:00:28.074
This is also a unique experience
in my career.


7
00:00:28.157 --> 00:00:32.120
Now, the guy was a beast.

8
00:00:32.203 --> 00:00:33.454
Onstage and off.

9
00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:37.458
Offstage, this motherfucker rolled
one blunt after another like a master.


10
00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:41.921
And onstage… [exhales]

11
00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:43.756
…he was like a force of nature.

12
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.678
In fact, he called himself
after a natural disaster.


13
00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.309
It is my pleasure to present
to you guys tonight,


14
00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:56.603
the first Netflix special

15
00:00:57.854 --> 00:00:59.689
that I've ever produced

16
00:00:59.772 --> 00:01:00.940
that I'm not in.

17
00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:05.278
Make some noise
for Earthquake in <i>Legendary</i>.

Yes, yes. DC, what's happening?

32
00:01:45.526 --> 00:01:47.612
Goddamn right.

33
00:01:47.695 --> 00:01:49.864
Good to be home, goddamn it.

34
00:01:50.448 --> 00:01:54.118
Good to be home.
Southeast DC, that's right.


35
00:01:54.202 --> 00:01:56.204
Ballou High School.

36
00:01:56.287 --> 00:01:59.040
That's what we're talking about.
It's the real DC.


37
00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:01.042
They came to me and said,

38
00:02:01.125 --> 00:02:03.544
"We're gonna do this special.
Where do you want to do it at?"


39
00:02:03.628 --> 00:02:06.047
Could've did it anywhere in the world.

40
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.132
I said, "No, I want to come home.

41
00:02:08.216 --> 00:02:12.011
I want to come home
and see how it is."

42
00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:15.807
And goddamn it, I'm feeling good.
I hope y'all feeling good.


43
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.892
I'm feeling good
'cause I got that vaccine.


44
00:02:17.976 --> 00:02:19.269
[laughter]

45
00:02:19.352 --> 00:02:22.981
Yeah. I'm telling you,
I got it when it first came out.


46
00:02:23.064 --> 00:02:26.150
The line was so long,
it looked like they was hiring.


47
00:02:27.277 --> 00:02:29.404
I stood in that motherfucker.

48
00:02:29.487 --> 00:02:31.322
I'm like, "I hope they don't run out."

49
00:02:31.406 --> 00:02:32.323
[laughter]

50
00:02:32.407 --> 00:02:33.866
It looked like they was running out.

51
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.202
There was this old lady,
and she was 89, in front of me.


52
00:02:36.286 --> 00:02:37.787
I just pushed her to the side.

53
00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:41.374
"Come on, Mama, you done lived your life.

54
00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:45.044
You got more problems
than this coronavirus.


55
00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:48.423
You're in a wheelchair with crutches.

56
00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:50.341
You're being selfish right now.

57
00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:54.512
You're supposed to be home somewhere
getting together with the Lord.


58
00:02:55.513 --> 00:02:56.848
You're being real selfish."

59
00:02:57.515 --> 00:03:00.101
You can't tell Black people
you took the shot.


60
00:03:00.184 --> 00:03:02.311
Oh! They look at you
like you done sold out.


61
00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:03.396
[laughter]

62
00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:06.107
"You put that shit in your body?
Ooh, Lord. Mm-mmm.


63
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.318
Oh! Oh, goddamn. 
Say it ain't so.

64
00:03:09.402 --> 00:03:10.945
Say it ain't so.

65
00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:12.655
How could you do that?"

66
00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.575
I said, "The same way you put
that cocaine in your nose.


67
00:03:16.284 --> 00:03:19.120
You ain't got no problem
with that eight ball, motherfucker.


68
00:03:19.203 --> 00:03:21.914
But I'm wrong for trusting Fauci.

69
00:03:21.998 --> 00:03:25.168
You get your drugs from a nigga
in the club in the bathroom."


70
00:03:26.044 --> 00:03:28.755
You see them smoking a blunt
with eight people. Just smoking it.


71
00:03:28.838 --> 00:03:31.007
[coughing] "Ooh!"

72
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.842
Just passing it around.

73
00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:34.719
"You're gonna take that chance.

74
00:03:34.802 --> 00:03:37.221
But I'm wrong for fucking with Fauci."

75
00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:38.306
[laughter]

76
00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:40.767
I've got a cousin.
This motherfucker lives in Michigan.


77
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.852
He done call me and said,
"Quake, I heard bad news."


78
00:03:42.935 --> 00:03:45.813
"What's wrong?" He said, "Man,
I heard you put that poison in your body.


79
00:03:45.897 --> 00:03:48.941
How could you do it?"
I said, "Nigga, you live in Flint.


80
00:03:49.025 --> 00:03:51.652
[laughter, applause]

81
00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:53.780
And you just got out the shower.

82
00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.576
You ain't got no problem with
that funky-ass water on your Black ass."


83
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.914
I mean, they ought to be ashamed
of their damned selves.


84
00:04:02.997 --> 00:04:06.292
I mean, you from DC, you done took
more chances than the vaccine.


85
00:04:06.876 --> 00:04:09.837
You know how many women
I done fucked with that had a fever?


86
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:14.175
I was like, "Ooh, you really is sick.

87
00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:16.803
I thought you ain't
want to give me none.

88
00:04:17.553 --> 00:04:19.806
I'ma get you
some Theraflu in the morning."


89
00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:22.975
[sneezes] "God bless you. 
God bless you."

90
00:04:23.768 --> 00:04:25.895
I just want motherfuckers
to be consistent.


91
00:04:26.813 --> 00:04:30.108
They are-
- No, keep that same energy

92
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.027
on all the other symptoms
you've got in your body.


93
00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:35.613
Coronavirus ain't the only shit
that's plaguing our community.


94
00:04:35.696 --> 00:04:38.533
I want you to be on it.
These hypocrites that we got out here--


95
00:04:38.616 --> 00:04:42.161
You got brothers out here been wearing
a mask straight for 18 months.


96
00:04:42.745 --> 00:04:45.123
Ain't seen a dentist in 18 years.

97
00:04:45.206 --> 00:04:46.916
[laughter]

98
00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.502
Just be chewing
on the left side of their mouth.


99
00:04:51.003 --> 00:04:53.339
Knowing they can't fuck
with that right tooth.


100
00:04:54.173 --> 00:04:57.552
Brush their teeth in the morning,
sink look like a crime scene.


101
00:04:58.177 --> 00:05:02.807
They be trying to hide evidence
like they on <i>First 48 Hours</i> and shit.


102
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.100
Kids coming in, looking at this,

103
00:05:04.183 --> 00:05:07.061
talking about, "Daddy, let me get
some of them Red Hots you eating."


104
00:05:07.645 --> 00:05:10.523
"I ain't eating no Red Hots."
"You are eating Red Hots!"


105
00:05:11.232 --> 00:05:12.942
Phony-ass.

106
00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:15.111
You know it. Stay consistent.

107
00:05:15.194 --> 00:05:17.196
Be looking all good on the outside.

108
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.783
Jordans on their feet, diamonds
in their ear. Flawless on the outside.


109
00:05:20.867 --> 00:05:23.661
Inside, blood pressure
higher than giraffe pussy.


110
00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:27.206
Type 2, 3, 4, 5 diabetes.

111
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.710
Still standing in line,
trying to get a Popeyes chicken sandwich.


112
00:05:31.335 --> 00:05:34.505
Eat four of them motherfuckers.
"I don't know why I'm dizzy.


113
00:05:35.256 --> 00:05:36.966
I took a Benadryl."

114
00:05:37.592 --> 00:05:40.386
"Benadryl don't help no stroke,
motherfucker.


115
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.599
Everything ain't your allergies, nigga.
Everything ain't your allergies."


116
00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:48.769
Left arm be going numb. "What's wrong?"

117
00:05:48.853 --> 00:05:50.688
"Oh, that mean
it gonna rain this Saturday."


118
00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:53.983
"What the fuck you mean
it's gonna rain this Saturday?


119
00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:57.320
Your arm ain't no weatherman, nigga.
Go see a doctor."


120
00:05:58.362 --> 00:05:59.989
You know who they are.

121
00:06:00.072 --> 00:06:03.284
Got car insurance.
Ain't got no health insurance.


122
00:06:03.367 --> 00:06:05.703
He all at the club,
"Look at my new ride, nigga.


123
00:06:05.786 --> 00:06:08.456
Full coverage, zero deductible."

124
00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.958
"What about your liver?"
"Oh, I leave that to Jesus.


125
00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:12.043
[laughter]

126
00:06:12.126 --> 00:06:13.794
He know my heart."

127
00:06:14.837 --> 00:06:16.005
Health is wealth.

128
00:06:16.088 --> 00:06:18.174
If you ain't learned shit
through this pandemic,


129
00:06:18.257 --> 00:06:20.885
that bag don't mean shit
if you ain't got your health.


130
00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.639
You know-- You need to know
the status of your health.


131
00:06:24.722 --> 00:06:26.140
And the only way you're gonna know

132
00:06:26.224 --> 00:06:28.768
the status of your health
is get a physical.


133
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:30.770
Your president, Barack Obama,

134
00:06:30.853 --> 00:06:34.232
put his whole political capital
on the line for Obamacare.


135
00:06:34.315 --> 00:06:35.483
I got Obamacare.

136
00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:39.070
Ain't no way they're gonna put all
these hospitals and urgent cares up there,


137
00:06:39.153 --> 00:06:40.821
and something wrong with my chest,

138
00:06:40.905 --> 00:06:43.407
I'm gonna go home, take a nap
and drink a ginger ale.


139
00:06:44.867 --> 00:06:47.620
[laughs] Somebody gonna see me.

140
00:06:48.287 --> 00:06:50.122
I'm just gonna have to owe you.

141
00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.377
When Obamacare came out, nigga,
I was on that shit.


142
00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.170
I filled it out. 
[imitates typing]

143
00:06:56.254 --> 00:06:57.964
Didn't even wait for a policy number.

144
00:06:58.047 --> 00:07:01.509
As soon as they said, "approved," nigga,
I ran straight to the doctor.


145
00:07:01.592 --> 00:07:04.637
"Hey, what you here for?"
"Nigga, I want a full physical."


146
00:07:05.304 --> 00:07:08.140
They're like, "Who your provider?"
I wrote, "Obamacare."


147
00:07:08.224 --> 00:07:09.350
[laughter]

148
00:07:09.433 --> 00:07:11.560
[chuckles] 'Cause that nigga cares.

149
00:07:12.478 --> 00:07:13.562
"Now that I got insurance,

150
00:07:13.646 --> 00:07:16.357
I want every test you got
in this hospital, from A to Z, nigga.


151
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.608
Don't skip none of them.

152
00:07:17.692 --> 00:07:23.197
I want EKG, EGG, pap smear,
I want it all, motherfucker.


153
00:07:24.407 --> 00:07:29.912
And I want ultrasound, mammogram,
father-gram, leg-gram.


154
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.999
An eight ball. 
That's a half a gram.

155
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:36.168
I want all my grams, nigga."

156
00:07:36.752 --> 00:07:38.087
But health is wealth.

157
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.716
You will not know the status
of your health unless you get a physical.


158
00:07:41.799 --> 00:07:45.094
Every year, for my birthday,
that is my gift to myself.


159
00:07:45.177 --> 00:07:48.556
We still dying of illnesses
they done already cured in full.


160
00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:51.183
And it's the scariest shit in the world,
because certain people,


161
00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:53.644
you know something's wrong with your body,
but you don't go.


162
00:07:53.728 --> 00:07:56.981
See, me personally, I would hate for
something to be wrong with my damn body


163
00:07:57.064 --> 00:08:01.861
and I never, ever do nothing about it,
and then I just let it go and go.


164
00:08:01.944 --> 00:08:04.614
And then finally be rushed to
the hospital, and the doctor like, "Ooh.


165
00:08:04.697 --> 00:08:09.076
If you'd have got here three weeks ago,
that shit was just in your ear."


166
00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.161
[laughter]

167
00:08:10.244 --> 00:08:12.872
"Where's it at now?" "In your foot."

168
00:08:12.955 --> 00:08:14.874
"How long I got?" "Tomorrow."

169
00:08:16.208 --> 00:08:18.878
It's the scariest shit in the world.
I get a physical every year.


170
00:08:18.961 --> 00:08:20.171
This year was no different.

171
00:08:20.254 --> 00:08:22.256
Doctor came in.
I said, "How am I doing, Doc?"


172
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.091
He said, "I got your lab result back.

173
00:08:24.175 --> 00:08:27.053
Everything is looking good.
You just have one minor discrepancy."


174
00:08:27.136 --> 00:08:29.388
I said, "What's that?"
He said, "Your PSA is high."


175
00:08:29.472 --> 00:08:32.516
I said, "What's that?" He said,
"That's the indicator of your prostate.


176
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.187
You being a Black man, prostate cancer
is prevalent in your community.


177
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.190
What I need you to do is go back
and see the reception,


178
00:08:39.273 --> 00:08:41.067
make another appointment, come back.

179
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:44.153
I'm gonna do a prostate exam
along with your physical.


180
00:08:44.236 --> 00:08:46.322
I'm running behind
about a month and a half.


181
00:08:46.405 --> 00:08:48.240
I should be able to
get to see you then."

182
00:08:48.324 --> 00:08:50.743
I'm like, "Fuck that, nigga.
We doing this shit today.


183
00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:53.788
I got Obamacare, nigga.
Put that shit on the bill.


184
00:08:54.664 --> 00:08:57.541
Let's run that shit up
before that Republican-care come."


185
00:08:58.167 --> 00:09:01.087
He said, "You want to do it today?"
I said, "Yeah, I want to do it today."


186
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.297
So I start rolling up my sleeves.

187
00:09:03.381 --> 00:09:04.882
[laughter]

188
00:09:07.968 --> 00:09:09.929
Yeah, he laughed just like that.

189
00:09:10.888 --> 00:09:14.183
He said, "No,
we don't do no prostate exam like that."


190
00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:17.019
I said, "How you do it?"
He said, "We do that with a rectum exam."


191
00:09:17.103 --> 00:09:19.480
I said, "Well, I don't think I got that
on my Obamacare."


192
00:09:19.563 --> 00:09:20.856
[laughter]

193
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.443
[laughs] I said, "I don't think Barack
would do that shit for me."


194
00:09:25.027 --> 00:09:28.072
He said, "Just go in the other room.
There's a gown behind the door.


195
00:09:28.155 --> 00:09:31.575
Take your clothes off, put the gown on and
come back out. We can do the procedure."


196
00:09:31.659 --> 00:09:34.495
I'm gonna tell you all right now,
my people from DC,


197
00:09:34.578 --> 00:09:36.789
I have been rich my whole life.

198
00:09:36.872 --> 00:09:38.916
And I'm not talking about monetarily.

199
00:09:38.999 --> 00:09:42.878
I'm talking about rich of the blessing
of my God.


200
00:09:42.962 --> 00:09:45.673
Been on this earth 58 years.

201
00:09:45.756 --> 00:09:48.092
I have never spent
a night in a hospital.

202
00:09:48.175 --> 00:09:50.177
I have never had no surgery.

203
00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:52.012
I ain't never had no broken bones,

204
00:09:52.096 --> 00:09:56.642
other than this wrist right here riding
that raggedy-ass bike my daddy gave me.


205
00:09:56.726 --> 00:09:58.811
So I don't know shit about no hospital.

206
00:09:58.894 --> 00:10:02.106
So when he told me to go take my clothes
off and put the gown on, I did it.


207
00:10:02.189 --> 00:10:03.774
And I put the motherfucker on.

208
00:10:03.858 --> 00:10:06.026
But it was too small. 
It wouldn't close.

209
00:10:06.736 --> 00:10:08.529
So I stuck my head
behind the door and said,


210
00:10:08.612 --> 00:10:11.991
"Hey, Doc, I need a bigger gown. This
motherfucker ain't going over my stomach."


211
00:10:12.074 --> 00:10:14.785
He said, "No, you've got it on wrong.
Turn it around."


212
00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:16.787
I said, "I'll be damned.

213
00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.832
I know I'm wearing this gown right."

214
00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:23.377
'Cause if it's between my dick
and my ass being out,


215
00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:26.046
my dick already understands.

216
00:10:26.797 --> 00:10:29.341
The ass is always covered.

217
00:10:29.425 --> 00:10:32.052
And every part of
my body knows that rule.

218
00:10:32.136 --> 00:10:34.764
If I only got
one sock, fuck my foot.

219
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:38.100
That motherfucker going down
the crack of my ass.


220
00:10:38.184 --> 00:10:42.271
And if we doing a rectum exam,
I know I'm wearing this gown right.


221
00:10:42.354 --> 00:10:44.732
'Cause you're gonna have
to lift this bitch and let me know


222
00:10:44.815 --> 00:10:45.941
it's about to go down.

223
00:10:46.025 --> 00:10:49.195
I ain't just gonna leave it open for you
to come in there when you feel like it.


224
00:10:50.362 --> 00:10:52.114
I don't know what kind of…

225
00:10:52.198 --> 00:10:54.950
I don't know what kind of patients
you be having


226
00:10:55.034 --> 00:10:58.662
with their head down, ass up,
but I ain't that kind of patient.


227
00:10:58.746 --> 00:11:01.207
I need a head start or a warning.

228
00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:04.668
Ten, nine, eight… Oh, shit.

229
00:11:04.752 --> 00:11:07.713
My ass is getting a little chilly.

230
00:11:07.797 --> 00:11:10.257
It must be time
for him to do it.

231
00:11:10.341 --> 00:11:13.135
So I knew I
had the gown on right,

232
00:11:13.219 --> 00:11:15.221
so I just walked out there,
holding my dick.


233
00:11:15.304 --> 00:11:16.680
I said, "I'm ready."

234
00:11:17.973 --> 00:11:20.684
He said, "I told you. You've got the gown
on wrong. Turn it around."


235
00:11:20.768 --> 00:11:24.230
I said, "I'll be damned." He said,
"Fuck it. Bend down and look over there."


236
00:11:24.313 --> 00:11:26.899
I said, "I don't
like how you said that.

237
00:11:26.982 --> 00:11:29.527
You need to take
that bass out your voice.

238
00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.696
You're a little too angry
to be fucking with my ass right now.


239
00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.699
I think we need to reschedule
this appointment.


240
00:11:35.783 --> 00:11:39.954
And if you're gonna keep arguing like this
with me, I need to put my drawers on.


241
00:11:40.037 --> 00:11:43.040
I don't like to argue with no nigga
if I ain't got no drawers on.


242
00:11:43.123 --> 00:11:47.378
You got your drawers on.
Why can't I put my drawers on?"


243
00:11:48.087 --> 00:11:51.632
So I went on and bent back over. "Come on.
Let's get this bullshit over with."


244
00:11:51.715 --> 00:11:54.927
This nigga gonna say, "Stay still."
I said, "Shit.


245
00:11:55.678 --> 00:12:00.057
You better hit this motherfucker
while it's moving. I told you I'm scared.


246
00:12:01.016 --> 00:12:05.354
My leg is shaking 'cause I'm afraid."
So I looked over my shoulder.


247
00:12:05.437 --> 00:12:08.232
This motherfucker
put gel on three fingers.


248
00:12:08.315 --> 00:12:11.443
I jumped the fuck up.
He was like, "What's wrong?"


249
00:12:11.527 --> 00:12:14.071
I said, "Let me see what finger
you're gonna use.


250
00:12:14.154 --> 00:12:16.657
Oh, you ain't using that finger
with that fucked-up knuckle.


251
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:21.078
Trying to put that big-ass knuckle in
my ass, that football knuckle you got.


252
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:24.164
I ought to whup your ass for trying
to put that motherfucker in me.


253
00:12:24.248 --> 00:12:27.126
Your pinkie you got should be able
to find what you're looking for.


254
00:12:27.209 --> 00:12:30.629
I ought to whup your ass, Doc.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.


255
00:12:30.713 --> 00:12:33.799
Are you sure this is the only way
you can check my prostate?


256
00:12:33.882 --> 00:12:37.678
'Cause if I go home and I google
and I find there's another test,


257
00:12:37.761 --> 00:12:40.723
I'm gonna come back here
and whup your motherfucking ass


258
00:12:40.806 --> 00:12:42.891
in front of all this equipment."

259
00:12:42.975 --> 00:12:44.059
[laughter]

260
00:12:44.143 --> 00:12:45.894
So I went on and bent back over.

261
00:12:45.978 --> 00:12:48.480
"Come on.
Let's get this bullshit over with."


262
00:12:48.564 --> 00:12:53.819
He lifted up my gown, and I said,
"Oh, shit. It's about to go down."


263
00:12:53.902 --> 00:12:57.573
And he lifted it up and he broke me off.
I was like, "Oh, goddamn it."


264
00:12:57.656 --> 00:13:00.909
He said, "Don't worry. It ain't gonna
take long." I said, "You ain't got long.


265
00:13:00.993 --> 00:13:03.662
Hurry up and find
what you're looking for."


266
00:13:03.746 --> 00:13:06.332
He kept moving his finger
in and out of my ass.


267
00:13:06.415 --> 00:13:08.876
I said, "Fuck it.
Take your finger out of my ass.


268
00:13:08.959 --> 00:13:10.878
If I've got prostate cancer,
leave it in there.


269
00:13:12.254 --> 00:13:15.049
I'm just gonna have to take it up
with the Lord.


270
00:13:15.132 --> 00:13:17.259
But you ain't just gonna
rotate your finger


271
00:13:17.343 --> 00:13:19.553
in and out of my ass
like this no more, sir.


272
00:13:19.637 --> 00:13:22.848
Take your finger out of my ass
immediately, sir.


273
00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:26.602
Stop right now. 
No means no, sir."

274
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.272
[laughing]

275
00:13:35.194 --> 00:13:40.282
I tried-- I got up.
Nigga tried to fix my goddamn gown.


276
00:13:40.366 --> 00:13:43.661
He gonna take the glove off
all seductively,


277
00:13:44.453 --> 00:13:46.664
one finger at a time.

278
00:13:46.747 --> 00:13:50.000
Gonna look me in the face,
give me a box of tissues,


279
00:13:50.084 --> 00:13:51.835
talking about, "Wipe yourself off.

280
00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:52.920
[laughter]

281
00:13:53.003 --> 00:13:56.465
Pull your drawers up.
Follow me in the other room."


282
00:13:56.548 --> 00:13:59.009
I said, "This nigga has just assaulted me.

283
00:13:59.593 --> 00:14:01.178
I've been raped."

284
00:14:01.261 --> 00:14:03.722
I went and bought
me a "Me Too" T-shirt.

285
00:14:03.806 --> 00:14:04.807
[laughter]

286
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.477
I went all to the meeting.
I was like, "Me too, bitches. Me too.


287
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.188
Y'all are gonna hear what happened to me
in that doctor's office.


288
00:14:11.271 --> 00:14:13.065
I've got a story to tell."

289
00:14:13.732 --> 00:14:17.027
I left that doctor's office,
ass just slippery.


290
00:14:17.111 --> 00:14:18.112
[laughter]

291
00:14:18.195 --> 00:14:20.656
Slid all the way to the elevator.

292
00:14:20.739 --> 00:14:22.866
Couldn't even look
another man in the face.


293
00:14:23.492 --> 00:14:25.995
I was like, "He broke me in there!
He broke me in there!"


294
00:14:27.997 --> 00:14:30.708
Seen a gay dude.
I was like, "You're a soldier.


295
00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:34.545
You can take a dick.
I couldn't take a pinkie.


296
00:14:34.628 --> 00:14:36.755
You're a tough one. 
You're tough."

297
00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:39.508
If you're taking a dick every night, mmm!

298
00:14:40.968 --> 00:14:43.012
These ain't jokes.

299
00:14:47.725 --> 00:14:51.437
And Black people, we done voted Trump out,

300
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.647
but we ain't killed this motherfucker.

301
00:14:53.731 --> 00:14:56.025
He's still alive politically.

302
00:14:56.108 --> 00:14:58.777
White people believe in him
right below Jesus.


303
00:14:58.861 --> 00:15:01.071
Oh, they believe in his ass.

304
00:15:01.155 --> 00:15:03.449
They're just lying to good white folks.

305
00:15:03.532 --> 00:15:04.908
"Stop the steal.

306
00:15:04.992 --> 00:15:06.660
They just stole the vote.

307
00:15:06.744 --> 00:15:09.913
Fraud. Irregularity with voting."

308
00:15:09.997 --> 00:15:13.917
See, Black people, I don't never want
y'all ever to say your votes don't count.


309
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:16.295
The reason why
they've got all these problems,


310
00:15:16.378 --> 00:15:20.257
changing all-- the Republicans changing
all the goddamn rules for voting,


311
00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.593
is 'cause we showed the fuck up.

312
00:15:26.805 --> 00:15:30.309
I tell my white friends all the time:
"If you're gonna lie on Black people,


313
00:15:30.392 --> 00:15:32.811
at least get a lie
that's believable, nigga.


314
00:15:32.895 --> 00:15:34.646
You want the whole world to believe

315
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.483
that niggas went down there
and voted two times?"


316
00:15:40.027 --> 00:15:43.363
We commit a lot of crimes,
but we don't fuck with that paperwork.


317
00:15:45.657 --> 00:15:49.328
But you can't say nothing. You can't tell
a Trump supporter nothing about Trump.


318
00:15:49.411 --> 00:15:53.707
"Oh, yeah, not my Trump, mm-mmm!"
They love motherfucking Trump.


319
00:15:53.791 --> 00:15:57.086
People ask me all the time, "What kind of
woman are you looking for in your life?"


320
00:15:57.169 --> 00:16:00.631
I say, "Nigga, I'm looking
for a woman like a Trump supporter.


321
00:16:00.714 --> 00:16:04.009
No matter what she hears about me,
that bitch don't believe shit."


322
00:16:04.093 --> 00:16:05.094
[laughter]

323
00:16:05.177 --> 00:16:07.054
"I heard he got another woman."

324
00:16:07.137 --> 00:16:09.389
"That's fake news, baby. 
That's fake news.

325
00:16:10.099 --> 00:16:12.976
Don't listen to them hos.
They're the enemy of the state."


326
00:16:14.436 --> 00:16:16.355
These ain't jokes.

327
00:16:16.438 --> 00:16:20.192
I knew Trump was the pimp of all pimps,
nigga, when he came here


328
00:16:20.275 --> 00:16:23.195
and sent them motherfuckers up here
January 6th.


329
00:16:23.278 --> 00:16:26.573
He told the motherfuckers,
"Meet me here January 6th."


330
00:16:26.657 --> 00:16:29.284
They came up there like he was Moses.

331
00:16:31.537 --> 00:16:35.582
Just stepping. I've never seen
so many RVs, pickup trucks,


332
00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:37.126
white women with no teeth.

333
00:16:37.209 --> 00:16:38.544
They was everywhere.

334
00:16:38.627 --> 00:16:39.670
[laughter]

335
00:16:39.753 --> 00:16:42.131
And then he came out and talked.

336
00:16:42.214 --> 00:16:45.551
Did the speech,
their old motherfucking fearless leader.


337
00:16:45.634 --> 00:16:49.805
"Right now, they're in there,
trying to certify the steal.


338
00:16:49.888 --> 00:16:53.016
You're not doing anything.
They're stealing your vote.


339
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:57.563
If you allow what happens in there,
you're not gonna have a country.


340
00:16:57.646 --> 00:17:02.568
Now, what we're gonna do, we're gonna
walk down to the Capitol and stop 'em.


341
00:17:02.651 --> 00:17:05.070
I'ma go with you,
and I'ma meet you there."


342
00:17:06.321 --> 00:17:08.031
[chuckles] Trump went home.

343
00:17:09.283 --> 00:17:12.077
That nigga was at the crib, just chilling.

344
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:16.540
White people was going crazy, nigga.
They was knocking shit over,


345
00:17:16.623 --> 00:17:21.378
whupping police asses,
climbing all on the wall and shit.


346
00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:24.256
I was watching that shit on TV.
All I was wishing is,


347
00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:28.260
"Ooh, I wish I was a Capitol police
working that day."


348
00:17:28.343 --> 00:17:30.095
If I was there, 
I would have been like…

349
00:17:30.179 --> 00:17:31.597
[imitating gunshots]

350
00:17:33.557 --> 00:17:35.767
"What you doing?" "Saving democracy.

351
00:17:40.105 --> 00:17:41.815
These motherfuckers are everywhere.

352
00:17:43.233 --> 00:17:45.444
If you ain't gonna use your gun,
give it to me.


353
00:17:50.282 --> 00:17:52.868
There's that motherfucker
with that Confederate flag."


354
00:17:54.912 --> 00:17:56.580
Click, click, click. [grunts]

355
00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.210
Oh, I would have tore their ass up.

356
00:18:01.293 --> 00:18:04.379
I'd have called my boy. "I told you
to be here as a security guard."


357
00:18:04.463 --> 00:18:06.506
[imitating gunshots]

358
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:09.134
I'm shooting Trump supporters
on the clock.


359
00:18:09.218 --> 00:18:11.011
[laughter]

360
00:18:11.094 --> 00:18:13.597
"Don't punch me out.
I'm gonna do overtime today."


361
00:18:16.725 --> 00:18:19.144
"What's your name, boy?"
"Crispus Attucks."


362
00:18:21.772 --> 00:18:25.859
Believe me, if I was working,
they would have got off them steps.


363
00:18:25.943 --> 00:18:27.527
"Stop the steal!" [imitates gunshots]

364
00:18:27.611 --> 00:18:30.197
"This nigga is serious.
Back up, Billy Bob."


365
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.282
[laughter]

366
00:18:34.159 --> 00:18:36.870
[cheering, applause]

367
00:18:42.292 --> 00:18:45.504
Trump ain't got no cut.
He ain't give a fuck.


368
00:18:45.587 --> 00:18:50.008
I knew he had no cut when he told
John McCain, "You ain't no war hero."


369
00:18:50.926 --> 00:18:54.179
[chuckles] And they said, "Why?"
"Cause he got captured.


370
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:57.307
I like soldiers that don't get caught."

371
00:18:57.891 --> 00:19:01.103
John McCain hated that motherfucker
till the day he died.


372
00:19:01.186 --> 00:19:04.022
They say you ain't supposed
to take a grudge to your grave.


373
00:19:04.106 --> 00:19:07.985
John McCain was like, "Fuck that shit."
I'ma tell you something.


374
00:19:08.068 --> 00:19:10.862
If you down for Trump, against Trump,
or even if you are Trump,


375
00:19:10.946 --> 00:19:12.531
you've gotta look yourself in the mirror.

376
00:19:12.614 --> 00:19:14.616
You know you a fucked-up individual

377
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.952
when a nigga
don't want you at his funeral.


378
00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.499
They said John McCain's last words
were like, "Tell that nigga not to come."


379
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:25.210
They said, "What about the Reaper?"

380
00:19:25.294 --> 00:19:29.715
"Mm-mmm! If he comes in the church,
I'ma walk out the casket."


381
00:19:30.424 --> 00:19:33.218
Like, "Damn,
he blocked that nigga like Facebook."


382
00:19:34.303 --> 00:19:35.804
[chuckles]

383
00:19:35.887 --> 00:19:37.931
You can say what you want
to say about John McCain,


384
00:19:38.015 --> 00:19:40.392
but that motherfucker was a war hero.

385
00:19:40.475 --> 00:19:44.563
I'm telling you. That motherfucker
was a prisoner of war, dawg.


386
00:19:44.646 --> 00:19:46.398
He got shot behind enemy lines

387
00:19:46.481 --> 00:19:49.443
fucking with them Viet Cong niggas,
and they fucked John up.


388
00:19:49.526 --> 00:19:51.528
If you want to know
what John McCain went through,


389
00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:53.822
all you've gotta do
is watch the first <i>Rambo.</i>


390
00:19:53.905 --> 00:19:56.074
[laughter]

391
00:19:56.158 --> 00:20:00.454
[chuckles] They pulled his nails out,
put bamboo in his ass.


392
00:20:00.537 --> 00:20:03.081
When you see John McCain,
that nigga walking like this.


393
00:20:03.707 --> 00:20:06.001
He couldn't even salute.
"How you doing?" "Mm-hmm."


394
00:20:06.084 --> 00:20:07.085
[laughter]

395
00:20:07.169 --> 00:20:08.795
They fucked John up.

396
00:20:08.879 --> 00:20:10.756
But what made him a man's man,

397
00:20:10.839 --> 00:20:14.551
do you know John McCain was being tortured
for five years straight?


398
00:20:14.634 --> 00:20:17.929
He could have got out early,
'cause his father was an admiral,


399
00:20:18.013 --> 00:20:19.639
and they was gonna do a prisoner swap,

400
00:20:19.723 --> 00:20:22.142
let him come home early
'cause of who his father was.


401
00:20:22.225 --> 00:20:25.103
They came down to the torture chamber
to John McCain and said,


402
00:20:25.187 --> 00:20:26.772
"Look, we've got some good news for you.

403
00:20:26.855 --> 00:20:29.024
You're gonna be able to go home
and be with your family."


404
00:20:29.107 --> 00:20:31.276
They released him and said,
"Come on. You're going home."


405
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.779
John McCain was like, "I'm not leaving."
"What you mean?"


406
00:20:33.862 --> 00:20:37.783
"I'm not leaving unless you release
all the other soldiers in here with me."


407
00:20:37.866 --> 00:20:38.867
[applause]

408
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:41.661
They said, "Hell no,"
and went back to whupping his ass. Pow!


409
00:20:41.745 --> 00:20:43.997
[laughter]

410
00:20:44.081 --> 00:20:45.957
I was in the military.
They showed us the tape.


411
00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:49.252
They said, "This is the kind of prisoner
of war you should be if you're captured."


412
00:20:49.336 --> 00:20:51.588
I said, "You might
as well let me out,

413
00:20:52.297 --> 00:20:54.424
'cause I'll never do that shit John did.

414
00:20:54.508 --> 00:20:55.884
'Cause if they come to release me,

415
00:20:55.967 --> 00:20:58.678
I'ma look at the rest of the soldiers
like, 'I'll see you later.


416
00:20:58.762 --> 00:21:01.223
God has heard my prayer.

417
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:04.434
Give me a letter.
I'll give it to your family.


418
00:21:04.518 --> 00:21:07.396
But my Black ass
is getting on this helicopter.


419
00:21:07.479 --> 00:21:10.649
Somebody got to tell
what these Pacquiaos have done to us,


420
00:21:11.358 --> 00:21:13.860
and God has chosen me.

421
00:21:13.944 --> 00:21:15.320
Wouldn't he do it?'"

422
00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:20.325
Hey, this ain't no joke right here.
I don't play with my health.


423
00:21:20.409 --> 00:21:25.038
Your life is the most precious thing
you've got, 'cause life is short, man.


424
00:21:25.122 --> 00:21:27.290
We losing some good-ass people.

425
00:21:27.374 --> 00:21:32.337
Shit. We lost Cicely Tyson, 96 years old.

426
00:21:32.421 --> 00:21:35.048
-Black people talking about "too soon."

428
00:21:37.592 --> 00:21:40.095
"Who knew?" I said, "I knew."

429
00:21:40.178 --> 00:21:45.392
When she got 88, I said, "Ooh!
You better get your paperwork in order."


430
00:21:45.475 --> 00:21:47.352
"Who knew?" I knew!

431
00:21:47.436 --> 00:21:50.147
When she got 89, I said,
"The Lord looking for you."


432
00:21:50.897 --> 00:21:52.482
"Who knew?" I knew.

433
00:21:52.566 --> 00:21:53.984
When she got 92, I said:

434
00:21:54.067 --> 00:21:59.781
♪ <i>Soon and very soon</i>
<i>You are gonna see the King</i> ♪

♪ <i>Soon and very soon</i>
<i>You are gonna see the King</i> ♪


436
00:22:05.787 --> 00:22:08.832
When she got 94, I said,
"Don't go to church.


437
00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:13.378
God's gonna say-- When he sees you there,
he's gonna say, 'Since you're here,


438
00:22:14.463 --> 00:22:16.256
stay right here.'"

I see some of y'all want to laugh.
Fuck y'all.


440
00:22:19.468 --> 00:22:22.721
You want to laugh and celebrate
when they make it to 96.

00:22:22.804 --> 00:22:26.391
That's when it's time to laugh
and tell jokes.


442
00:22:26.475 --> 00:22:31.188
It ain't funny when you die at 26,
and that's our fucking problem.


443
00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:33.982
I pay my respects all the time.

444
00:22:35.066 --> 00:22:37.110
The one that broke my heart
more than anything


445
00:22:37.194 --> 00:22:38.987
was when we lost Aretha Franklin,

446
00:22:39.738 --> 00:22:41.323
the Queen of Soul.

447
00:22:41.406 --> 00:22:45.285
Tried to pay my respects and watch
the funeral, but that funeral was so long.


448
00:22:45.994 --> 00:22:48.163
I kept hollering at
the TV, "Let her go.

449
00:22:48.246 --> 00:22:49.414
[laughter]

450
00:22:49.497 --> 00:22:51.625
She's supposed to be with the Lord."

451
00:22:51.708 --> 00:22:54.502
That funeral was so long,
they turned off my cable.


452
00:22:55.503 --> 00:22:58.298
I said, "This funeral done went through
two billing cycles."


453
00:22:58.924 --> 00:23:01.009
They called me.
"Why didn't you pay your cable bill?"


454
00:23:01.092 --> 00:23:02.510
I said, "I'm still at the funeral.

455
00:23:04.012 --> 00:23:05.263
Let her go."

456
00:23:06.056 --> 00:23:08.683
I've never seen a pastor
preach the whole Bible.


457
00:23:08.767 --> 00:23:09.768
[laughter]

458
00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:14.189
This nigga didn't miss a scripture.
I knew we was gonna be there a long time,


459
00:23:14.272 --> 00:23:17.025
'cause the nigga done come out
talking about, "In the beginning."


460
00:23:17.776 --> 00:23:19.319
I said, "The beginning?

461
00:23:20.779 --> 00:23:23.615
What do Adam and Eve
got to do with a funeral?


462
00:23:23.698 --> 00:23:27.118
Let her go.
She's supposed to be with the Lord."


463
00:23:27.202 --> 00:23:29.371
CNN was there.
They was unplugging their shit.


464
00:23:29.454 --> 00:23:31.289
"Come on. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

465
00:23:31.831 --> 00:23:33.833
We've been here for three weeks.

466
00:23:34.542 --> 00:23:36.836
Don Lemon is supposed to be
on TV right now."


467
00:23:37.545 --> 00:23:40.298
I kept hollering at
the TV, "Let her go."

468
00:23:40.382 --> 00:23:44.052
I knew it was long when Aretha got up
to change dresses.


469
00:23:44.135 --> 00:23:45.553
[laughter]

470
00:23:45.637 --> 00:23:49.349
"I'm gonna wear something different
in the second half of the funeral."


471
00:23:49.432 --> 00:23:55.105
I said, "The second half?
Who has a halftime at a funeral?


472
00:23:55.188 --> 00:23:59.109
Let her go.
She's supposed to be with the Lord."


473
00:23:59.776 --> 00:24:03.363
That funeral was so long, nigga.
They held it in Detroit so long,


474
00:24:03.446 --> 00:24:07.617
by the time she finally did make it
to the pearly gates to get into heaven,


475
00:24:07.701 --> 00:24:11.162
an angel came to the door
and said, "God's gone.


476
00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.041
You were supposed to be in here
three weeks ago.


477
00:24:15.125 --> 00:24:17.752
He touched you on the 3rd. 
It's the 21st.

478
00:24:18.503 --> 00:24:20.588
I know you're the queen,
but he's the king.


479
00:24:22.007 --> 00:24:25.260
You just can't have the Lord
just waiting for you, Aretha.


480
00:24:25.343 --> 00:24:27.679
This is no kind of respect.

481
00:24:27.762 --> 00:24:29.681
You're gonna have to go to hell."

482
00:24:31.141 --> 00:24:33.601
That would be fucked up, though,
if you made it to heaven,


483
00:24:33.685 --> 00:24:36.021
but you fucked around
and got to the gate late.


484
00:24:36.688 --> 00:24:41.526
You know, you look on the board, like,
"Ooh, my name up there. Shit, I made it."


485
00:24:41.609 --> 00:24:44.529
You see some of your boys,
like, "Damn, you ain't get in.


486
00:24:45.447 --> 00:24:48.992
Damn, man. I heard
it's gonna be hot where you going.


487
00:24:49.075 --> 00:24:50.869
Told you to go to Bible study."

488
00:24:50.952 --> 00:24:54.080
You're taking your time.
"Nigga, I got in."


489
00:24:54.164 --> 00:24:56.458
And you get to the gate,
and you see 'em locking.


490
00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:58.460
You're like, "Hold up, nigga, I'm here.

491
00:24:59.753 --> 00:25:02.297
I ain't moving my foot.
I'm supposed to be in there.


492
00:25:03.548 --> 00:25:07.093
You just can't lock a nigga out of here.
What kind of bullshit is this?


493
00:25:07.177 --> 00:25:12.182
You ain't say what time you had to be
at the gate. This is some bullshit."


494
00:25:12.265 --> 00:25:15.018
You be peeping in there.
"Ooh, it look nice in there.


495
00:25:15.977 --> 00:25:19.814
Heaven's everything they say in the Bible.
Uh-uh. Nigga, I'm getting in."


496
00:25:19.898 --> 00:25:22.734
You be like, "Come on, man.
This is bullshit.


497
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.195
I'm on Jesus's list."

498
00:25:26.071 --> 00:25:30.450
You be like, "It real nice in there.
Did my mama make it?


499
00:25:30.533 --> 00:25:33.078
Did she make it into heaven? She did?

500
00:25:33.161 --> 00:25:34.871
Could you tell her I'm out here?

501
00:25:34.954 --> 00:25:36.331
[laughter]

502
00:25:36.414 --> 00:25:41.503
And tell her that angel right there
won't let me in. This is some bullshit."


503
00:25:41.586 --> 00:25:44.547
If your mama came
and seen you was late getting to the gate,


504
00:25:44.631 --> 00:25:46.466
she would cuss your ass out.

505
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:49.511
"The fuck wrong with you?
Got me using this kind of language.


506
00:25:49.594 --> 00:25:52.180
You were late. Get your ass over there.
You were late getting in."


507
00:25:52.263 --> 00:25:54.724
"I'm sorry. I was on time.
That was the angel.


508
00:25:54.808 --> 00:25:56.601
He hates me and everything."

509
00:25:56.684 --> 00:26:00.355
"Get your ass over there while I go
find Jesus, see can I get you in.


510
00:26:01.356 --> 00:26:03.733
Stand over there with the rest
of them heathens."


511
00:26:04.442 --> 00:26:07.445
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
I'm so sorry."

512
00:26:07.529 --> 00:26:11.950
You go back and stand on the side
with everybody else that couldn't get in.


513
00:26:13.076 --> 00:26:16.204
"I think I'm getting in.

514
00:26:16.287 --> 00:26:19.165
My mom been knowing Jesus her whole life.

515
00:26:19.249 --> 00:26:20.625
[laughter]

516
00:26:20.708 --> 00:26:23.002
I know she got a plus-one.

517
00:26:25.797 --> 00:26:30.802
Your mama ain't get in?
She didn't? Not at all?


518
00:26:30.885 --> 00:26:32.762
Man, I'm sorry to hear that.

519
00:26:33.805 --> 00:26:36.975
I'll be-- I'm about to get in there.
I'ma get in.


520
00:26:37.058 --> 00:26:39.811
When I get in there, you want me
to tell somebody you out here?


521
00:26:41.354 --> 00:26:43.523
You don't know nobody that made it?

522
00:26:44.274 --> 00:26:47.193
All the people you know, you don't
know nobody you think made it?


523
00:26:47.902 --> 00:26:50.613
Nobody? That's fucked up.

524
00:26:51.281 --> 00:26:55.577
Oh, here come Jesus with my mama.
I'll see you later, Joel Osteen."


525
00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.912
[laughter]

526
00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.798
"This is my Bible."

527
00:27:13.178 --> 00:27:16.222
My son just turned 18 years old.

528
00:27:16.306 --> 00:27:20.101
Best day of my life,
because he's one of the trios I have.


529
00:27:20.185 --> 00:27:22.437
I have three kids, and he's the last.

530
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.273
Eighteen years old,
and as a man that's in his 50s,


531
00:27:25.356 --> 00:27:27.609
when you see your
kids get 18 years old,

532
00:27:27.692 --> 00:27:30.361
that is your chance
for you to live your life.


533
00:27:30.445 --> 00:27:32.655
-[applause]
-I tell my kids all the time,


534
00:27:32.739 --> 00:27:36.367
"Once you turn 18,
our relationship has changed."


535
00:27:36.951 --> 00:27:39.329
"How is that, Daddy?"
I said, "Let me explain.


536
00:27:39.412 --> 00:27:44.292
I am no longer the provider.
I am the adviser.


537
00:27:45.293 --> 00:27:50.507
So when you've got a problem now, I say,
'This is what I would do if I was you.'


538
00:27:51.382 --> 00:27:54.219
But you was raised right, nigga.
Make good decisions.


539
00:27:54.302 --> 00:27:57.472
Close the door so me
and your future stepmama can get busy."


540
00:27:58.181 --> 00:28:02.393
No, man, when your kids become an adult,
it is your time to capture


541
00:28:02.477 --> 00:28:06.189
the things that you wanted to do
that you sacrificed by raising them.


542
00:28:06.272 --> 00:28:09.651
I tell people all the time,
kids are the most expensive thing


543
00:28:09.734 --> 00:28:12.529
you will ever purchase,
to ever have in your life,


544
00:28:12.612 --> 00:28:15.782
'cause they-- at the maximum,
they are dream killers.


545
00:28:17.242 --> 00:28:20.203
At the minimum, nigga,
they are dream delayers.


546
00:28:20.912 --> 00:28:24.624
'Cause you done put what you wanted to do
to facilitate their growth.


547
00:28:24.707 --> 00:28:28.211
And when they get 18, it's your time
to do the things you need to do,


548
00:28:28.294 --> 00:28:30.213
'cause you're in
the fourth quarter of your life.


549
00:28:30.296 --> 00:28:31.339
But some of y'all don't.

550
00:28:31.422 --> 00:28:35.468
Y'all still be in your kids' lives when
they're 18 as if they was an adolescent.


551
00:28:35.552 --> 00:28:36.886
And I don't blame most of y'all,

552
00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:40.056
because y'all let these kids
around here manipulate you.


553
00:28:40.139 --> 00:28:42.058
Because them kids
throw their guilt on you.


554
00:28:42.141 --> 00:28:45.019
They've been in your life
and seen some of the times


555
00:28:45.103 --> 00:28:48.982
when you was at your lowest point,
and they throw that shit in your face.


556
00:28:49.065 --> 00:28:52.944
They also know there's things you wanted
to do for them that you couldn't do,


557
00:28:53.027 --> 00:28:55.864
and you feel guilty,
and they play that shit on you.


558
00:28:55.947 --> 00:28:58.575
And I'm telling you right now,
from the bottom of my heart,


559
00:28:58.658 --> 00:29:00.285
fuck these kids.

560
00:29:00.368 --> 00:29:01.870
[laughter]

561
00:29:01.953 --> 00:29:04.914
Don't you let these motherfuckers
fuck with you.


562
00:29:04.998 --> 00:29:09.377
I'ma tell you right now. If you did
everything to the best of your ability


563
00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:13.131
to provide for your kids,
you are a great-ass parent.


564
00:29:13.214 --> 00:29:16.718
Don't you let these little motherfuckers
make you feel bad.


565
00:29:17.343 --> 00:29:20.555
I'm telling you right goddamn now.

566
00:29:20.638 --> 00:29:24.267
I wish one of my kids
would tell me I'm not a great-ass father.


567
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:26.352
I only got one question for 'em:

568
00:29:26.436 --> 00:29:30.940
"If I'm not a great father, nigga,
who are you comparing me to?


569
00:29:31.024 --> 00:29:34.903
Who is this mythological Black man
you think gonna make the sacrifices I did


570
00:29:34.986 --> 00:29:36.905
and all this for you like I did?

571
00:29:36.988 --> 00:29:40.366
Take you to all these activities,
go to your basketball game,


572
00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:44.037
be there for three hours,
and your ass don't even get in the game.


573
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.330
[laughter]

574
00:29:45.914 --> 00:29:48.249
Me and you sitting on the bench.

575
00:29:48.917 --> 00:29:51.753
You could have FaceTimed me this bullshit,

576
00:29:51.836 --> 00:29:54.881
sitting over there
like you're assistant coach and shit.


577
00:29:56.215 --> 00:29:59.218
Since we're comparing,
you ain't a good-ass child.


578
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:02.805
Almost lost my job fucking with your ass."

579
00:30:03.473 --> 00:30:04.974
Fuck these kids.

580
00:30:06.517 --> 00:30:08.269
These ain't jokes.

581
00:30:08.353 --> 00:30:11.272
I had the time to spend time with my son,
and it made me learn


582
00:30:11.356 --> 00:30:13.691
that our kids are not built like us.

583
00:30:13.775 --> 00:30:17.528
My son don't have no swag.
Zero. Nada. None.


584
00:30:17.612 --> 00:30:19.697
I told him the other day,
"Let's ride, Clyde."


585
00:30:19.781 --> 00:30:21.991
This nigga was like, "Who's Clyde, Daddy?"

586
00:30:22.617 --> 00:30:24.077
"Get your ass in the car."

587
00:30:24.744 --> 00:30:29.874
"I just want to know who Clyde is.
Is he a friend of yours?"


588
00:30:29.958 --> 00:30:31.584
"No, nigga. You're Clyde."

589
00:30:32.251 --> 00:30:34.921
"Mm-mmm. My name's Nathaniel."

590
00:30:35.004 --> 00:30:37.048
"Open your mouth. 
Let me swab you."

591
00:30:38.424 --> 00:30:41.803
You gotta understand. You can't raise
your kids the way you was raised.


592
00:30:41.886 --> 00:30:47.225
It does not apply. The way we was raised
does not have nothing to do with our kids.


593
00:30:47.308 --> 00:30:52.605
You gotta understand that we are
inner-city parents raising suburban kids,


594
00:30:52.689 --> 00:30:54.941
so all the things we went through
does not apply


595
00:30:55.024 --> 00:30:57.485
to these little, soft motherfuckers
we're dealing with.


596
00:30:58.152 --> 00:31:00.947
You put your hands on your kids,
just one of the ass whuppings


597
00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.408
that your mother and father gave you,
put it on your kid,


598
00:31:03.491 --> 00:31:05.994
you'll scar these little,
soft motherfuckers for life.


599
00:31:07.745 --> 00:31:09.872
They can't do it.
I just tried to punish my son.


600
00:31:09.956 --> 00:31:13.292
Sent him to his room.
This nigga writes a suicide note.


601
00:31:14.335 --> 00:31:16.963
He be in there. "Daddy, I don't know
how long I can take this shit.


602
00:31:17.797 --> 00:31:19.257
The walls are coming in on me."

603
00:31:20.049 --> 00:31:21.926
I said, "This nigga
could never go to jail."


604
00:31:22.802 --> 00:31:25.430
He can't even stay in his own room
with an Xbox.


605
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:28.641
These ain't jokes.

606
00:31:29.434 --> 00:31:32.478
My son got a concussion
from falling in grass.


607
00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:36.190
He was in the hospital for three weeks.

608
00:31:36.274 --> 00:31:39.360
"Hey, what happened to him?"
I said, "He tripped out back."


609
00:31:40.486 --> 00:31:42.030
They ain't built like us.

610
00:31:42.113 --> 00:31:46.200
You buy 'em a bike, you gotta get
a helmet, shoulder pads, knee pads.


611
00:31:46.284 --> 00:31:49.078
"You playing football or riding a bike,
motherfucker?"


612
00:31:49.871 --> 00:31:51.748
They're not built like us.

613
00:31:51.831 --> 00:31:56.419
We used to go to the park,
get on the swing set, and wrap the pole.


614
00:31:57.170 --> 00:32:00.339
Let one of these kids go to a swing set
and try to wrap the pole.


615
00:32:00.423 --> 00:32:02.425
Come back, chain around their neck.

And you're like,
"Get your ass down from there."

00:32:07.346 --> 00:32:10.475
"Why? You said go around"--
"Get your motherfucking ass"…


620
00:32:11.517 --> 00:32:13.311
They're not built like us.

621
00:32:13.394 --> 00:32:15.730
Can't leave 'em in
the car when it's hot.

622
00:32:15.813 --> 00:32:17.648
[laughter]

623
00:32:19.442 --> 00:32:21.819
Our mother left us in the car
when it was hot.


624
00:32:22.612 --> 00:32:24.697
We were just smart enough
to get the fuck out


625
00:32:26.324 --> 00:32:28.659
and look at the door to see
when she coming out.


626
00:32:29.327 --> 00:32:31.871
"Oh, here she come.
Get back in the car. Get back.


627
00:32:31.954 --> 00:32:33.581
That's right. I was sitting over here.

628
00:32:33.664 --> 00:32:36.375
You're right. You're right.
I was over here. You're right."


629
00:32:36.459 --> 00:32:37.877
Fuck her!

630
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:41.839
It don't take you no three hours
getting no tuna fish.


631
00:32:43.341 --> 00:32:45.802
Our kids just stay in the car and die.
[grunts]


632
00:32:46.385 --> 00:32:48.137
"Get your ass out of the car!"

633
00:32:48.221 --> 00:32:51.682
"You said, 'Don't get out.'"
"It's 200 degrees, motherfucker."


634
00:32:59.524 --> 00:33:02.735
Die in the car, stupid motherfuckers.

635
00:33:03.444 --> 00:33:05.154
Fuck these kids.

636
00:33:05.238 --> 00:33:07.490
But you ain't got to put
your hands on no kids.


637
00:33:07.573 --> 00:33:09.408
Your kids ain't doing
what they supposed to do,

I've done found their Achilles' heel.

639
00:33:11.202 --> 00:33:14.872
I know exactly what you can get,
how you can get 'em


640
00:33:14.956 --> 00:33:17.458
if they ain't doing what the fuck
they supposed to do.


641
00:33:17.542 --> 00:33:19.460
Found their weakness.

642
00:33:19.544 --> 00:33:21.170
No, it ain't the phone. No.

643
00:33:21.838 --> 00:33:25.341
All you need to do,
turn that motherfucking Wi-Fi off.

00:33:25.424 --> 00:33:27.009
[laughter]

They on that shit like crack.

I ain't lying to you.

647
00:33:31.973 --> 00:33:34.642
My son, he be upstairs. I be calling him,
"Come downstairs, nigga."


648
00:33:34.725 --> 00:33:37.562
Acting like he don't hear me.
I don't even call him no more.


649
00:33:37.645 --> 00:33:41.232
He don't do what the fuck he's supposed
to do, all I do is unplug that Wi-Fi.

[grunts]

651
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.610
Then they come in.
"Daddy, we ain't got no signal.

I said, "This nigga is cracking.

655
00:33:54.495 --> 00:33:56.330
"I ain't got no signal, Daddy.

It's got Halloween in it and everything."

657
00:33:59.292 --> 00:34:01.210
He's looking at me.
"Daddy, you got a signal?"


658
00:34:01.294 --> 00:34:02.712
I say, "I got a signal."

659
00:34:04.046 --> 00:34:05.256
"I ain't got a signal."

660
00:34:05.339 --> 00:34:07.216
"Take that trash out, nigga.
