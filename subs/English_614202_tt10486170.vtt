2
00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:29.099
One.

3
00:02:30.067 --> 00:02:31.001
Two.

4
00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.303
Good, two.

5
00:02:34.438 --> 00:02:35.439
Three.

6
00:02:38.475 --> 00:02:39.309
Four.

7
00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:43.748
Let's hold it there.

8
00:02:43.781 --> 00:02:45.650
Whoa, whoa, I said hold it.

9
00:02:46.516 --> 00:02:47.551
All right.

10
00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:48.385
Sorry.

11
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.556
Let's take a break.

12
00:02:54.858 --> 00:02:55.727
Are you all right?

13
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.395
Fine, but I'm knackered.

14
00:02:58.428 --> 00:02:59.363
You're knackered?

15
00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.133
You know they've
been asking after you


16
00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:04.534
down at the barracks bar.

17
00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.771
You should try and
get down sometime.


18
00:03:06.804 --> 00:03:08.405
I will.

19
00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.207
It's just difficult, you know.

20
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.610
Yeah, and if you
ever need a break,


21
00:03:12.643 --> 00:03:14.846
I can have a word with Sara.

22
00:03:14.878 --> 00:03:16.279
Thanks.

23
00:03:16.313 --> 00:03:17.447
You know, when you've
got three already,


24
00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:18.982
you don't even
notice another one.


25
00:03:21.284 --> 00:03:23.353
Are you sure you're all right?

26
00:03:23.387 --> 00:03:24.388
Yeah.

27
00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:25.790
C'mon, let's go again!

28
00:03:27.592 --> 00:03:29.594
Fists of fury!

29
00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:05.630
You're late.

30
00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:06.864
Sorry, Friday
afternoon traffic.


31
00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:10.635
She'll be hungry.

32
00:04:10.668 --> 00:04:12.737
She doesn't usually
eat this late.


33
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.539
Packed a bag for her,
you'll find dinner in there.


34
00:04:15.573 --> 00:04:17.374
She needs to eat as soon
as you get home, okay?


35
00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:18.241
Okay.

36
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.913
Mix four teaspoon fulls of
baby oats and boiling water


37
00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:23.447
for her breakfast.

38
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.082
Make sure it's cool enough
before you give it to her.


39
00:04:26.116 --> 00:04:26.918
Are you even listening to me?

40
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.385
Yes, sorry.

41
00:04:29.887 --> 00:04:34.892
Nappies, wipes, spare bottle,
milk, it's all in there.


42
00:04:36.026 --> 00:04:37.194
You all right with this?

43
00:04:37.227 --> 00:04:38.629
Of course I am!

44
00:04:57.314 --> 00:04:58.114
See you Sunday!

45
00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:01.418
Craig?

46
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.123
Take good care of her, okay?

47
00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:15.026
Ta-da!

48
00:06:16.594 --> 00:06:17.795
Let myself in.

49
00:06:17.828 --> 00:06:18.796
Thought you might
try being out on me.


50
00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:21.264
You scared the shit out of me!

51
00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:22.098
Got any salt?

52
00:06:22.132 --> 00:06:23.000
We need to do slammers.

53
00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:26.469
So?

54
00:06:27.605 --> 00:06:29.040
Do you mind if we stay in?

55
00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:30.775
Have a couple glasses
of wine, chill out?


56
00:06:30.808 --> 00:06:32.242
- Mm-mm-mm!
- Chill out!


57
00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:34.344
Mm-mm, you are gonna have
the best first night out


58
00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:35.445
a new mum's ever had.

59
00:06:38.281 --> 00:06:39.115
I don't know.

60
00:06:41.484 --> 00:06:43.588
I'm just not in the mood.

61
00:06:43.621 --> 00:06:44.722
I'll get some glasses.

62
00:06:55.231 --> 00:06:58.535
So, what happened to...

63
00:07:01.471 --> 00:07:03.841
What's his name?

64
00:07:04.775 --> 00:07:05.977
Jamal, was it?

65
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.210
Ugh, another loser.

66
00:07:09.614 --> 00:07:11.281
Oh.

67
00:07:11.314 --> 00:07:13.751
He couldn't cope with
a woman in uniform.


68
00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:17.822
Said I made him
feel emasculated.


69
00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:22.860
I'd rather have a civvie
than a squaddie any day.


70
00:07:22.893 --> 00:07:24.227
Yeah, well you didn't exactly

71
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.495
pick a good one
there, I'm afraid.


72
00:07:27.098 --> 00:07:28.633
Understatement of the year!

73
00:07:30.935 --> 00:07:32.402
He brought her around today.

74
00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:37.374
Did you demonstrate
her that elbow's


75
00:07:37.407 --> 00:07:39.010
the hardest part of the body?

76
00:07:39.043 --> 00:07:43.581
It's him, not her.

77
00:07:43.614 --> 00:07:46.684
She's thick, he's an asshole.

78
00:07:50.588 --> 00:07:51.656
I'll drink to that.

79
00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:39.737
Yo, this is
Craig, leave me a message.


80
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.740
You're meant to keep
your phone on, you dick.


81
00:08:42.773 --> 00:08:43.607
This is Sam.

82
00:08:44.942 --> 00:08:46.010
Can you call me, please?

83
00:08:46.043 --> 00:08:47.310
I haven't heard from you.

84
00:08:56.386 --> 00:08:57.287
I need a run.

85
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:04.795
Oh God.

86
00:09:32.656 --> 00:09:33.490
Hey!

87
00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:35.926
Hey!

88
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.095
Hey, baby,
what's the matter?


89
00:09:38.129 --> 00:09:39.797
She's been like
this all night.


90
00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.800
She's drenched!

91
00:09:42.833 --> 00:09:44.300
She's been burning up!

92
00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:45.936
Why didn't you call me?

93
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.638
Did she drink her
milk this morning?


94
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:49.439
I don't know,
I mean, ain't your mum


95
00:09:49.472 --> 00:09:50.674
a kiddie nurse or something?

96
00:09:50.708 --> 00:09:51.909
Can you call her?

97
00:09:51.942 --> 00:09:54.277
She lives 200
miles away, Craig.


98
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.946
Maybe you should take her, eh?

99
00:09:57.547 --> 00:09:59.817
Maybe it'll work out
better when she's older.


100
00:10:24.208 --> 00:10:25.776
She's got a temperature of 105.

101
00:10:27.745 --> 00:10:29.280
No, it's it out of hours.

102
00:10:30.513 --> 00:10:33.884
Okay, mum,
you know best.


103
00:10:35.518 --> 00:10:38.656
No, okay, let me just
write that down.


104
00:10:41.424 --> 00:10:42.226
Yeah?

105
00:10:44.895 --> 00:10:45.696
Uh-huh.

106
00:10:48.364 --> 00:10:50.234
Yes, I'll take her
right away, all right?


107
00:10:50.267 --> 00:10:51.735
I could
stop by this morning.


108
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:53.704
Of course I'm not
gonna leave her by hers.


109
00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:01.111
Grandma always knows
best, doesn't she?


110
00:11:04.148 --> 00:11:05.348
If I put you in that pram,

111
00:11:05.381 --> 00:11:07.852
you're gonna freak
out, aren't you?


112
00:11:07.885 --> 00:11:08.719
Okay?

113
00:11:18.863 --> 00:11:21.364
Oh, oh no, oh, it's all right.

114
00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:26.203
How 'bout the bouncer?

115
00:11:26.237 --> 00:11:30.107
The bouncer, we like
to bouncer, don't we?


116
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:31.709
Yeah, there you go.

117
00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:40.951
If your father wasn't such
an asshole and still around,


118
00:11:40.985 --> 00:11:43.821
taking care of you'd
be so much easier.


119
00:11:45.923 --> 00:11:46.824
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:11:56.667 --> 00:11:59.570
So I'm gonna go to the
chemist's and get your medicine,


121
00:11:59.603 --> 00:12:04.041
and I'll be eight minutes, tops.

122
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.711
Don't tell Gran, okay.

123
00:14:39.797 --> 00:14:40.631
Oh my God!

124
00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:36.413
Please!

125
00:16:37.649 --> 00:16:39.917
Someone let me out of here!

126
00:16:42.553 --> 00:16:43.387
Fucking!

127
00:18:31.928 --> 00:18:34.865
There's gotta be
a way out of here.


128
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.775
Get off me!

129
00:19:21.878 --> 00:19:22.879
Who's there?

130
00:19:27.517 --> 00:19:28.919
What do you want?

131
00:19:34.759 --> 00:19:35.926
Don't touch me!

132
00:20:35.552 --> 00:20:36.353
It's okay.

133
00:20:40.858 --> 00:20:42.259
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?

134
00:20:45.596 --> 00:20:46.430
What's your name?

135
00:20:48.298 --> 00:20:49.099
Stacy.

136
00:20:50.267 --> 00:20:52.335
Stacy, I'm Sam.

137
00:20:54.438 --> 00:20:56.574
Do you know a way out of here?

138
00:20:56.607 --> 00:20:59.376
There's nothing,
Kelly looked everywhere.


139
00:20:59.409 --> 00:21:00.243
Who's Kelly?

140
00:21:01.679 --> 00:21:04.514
The girl who was
here when I got here.


141
00:21:04.548 --> 00:21:06.082
Where is she now?

142
00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:13.791
What is that?

143
00:21:15.225 --> 00:21:17.160
It moves around.

144
00:21:17.194 --> 00:21:18.930
Do you remember
how you got here?


145
00:21:20.798 --> 00:21:22.966
I was walking home
from a club last night


146
00:21:22.999 --> 00:21:24.501
and woke up on the floor here.

147
00:21:29.306 --> 00:21:31.208
How did you get this?

148
00:21:32.142 --> 00:21:34.077
It.

149
00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:40.484
Listen to me, Stacy, my
baby's at home by herself.


150
00:21:40.517 --> 00:21:44.655
She's five months old, I
need to get out of here.


151
00:21:44.689 --> 00:21:46.389
And we can help each other.

152
00:21:48.826 --> 00:21:51.528
Find something, use
it as a battering ram,


153
00:21:51.562 --> 00:21:53.163
try and smash the door down.

154
00:21:53.196 --> 00:21:55.365
That's what Kelly
tried, it didn't like it.


155
00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:58.769
Well, we'll just
try again, okay?


156
00:21:59.637 --> 00:22:00.470
Come on!

157
00:22:43.046 --> 00:22:43.881
Wait here.

158
00:24:41.732 --> 00:24:43.801
You've been here since
last night, right?


159
00:24:45.002 --> 00:24:47.004
You've been all
around the factory?


160
00:24:47.038 --> 00:24:49.840
Over and over,
there's no way out.


161
00:24:49.874 --> 00:24:51.609
Have you seen a store room?

162
00:24:51.642 --> 00:24:54.111
Somewhere they might
keep one of these?


163
00:24:54.145 --> 00:24:55.913
I can't remember.

164
00:24:55.946 --> 00:24:58.248
If I can find where the
gas canisters are stored,


165
00:24:58.281 --> 00:25:00.084
this blowtorch will cut
through that padlock.


166
00:25:00.117 --> 00:25:02.086
How do you know all this?

167
00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:04.554
Was in the 24
Commandos Engineers.


168
00:25:07.158 --> 00:25:09.160
Listen, I've got an idea.

169
00:25:09.192 --> 00:25:11.996
If we split up, we'll
find it twice as fast.


170
00:25:13.263 --> 00:25:16.133
Come on, you survived
in here a day already.


171
00:25:16.167 --> 00:25:17.001
You can do it.

172
00:25:18.501 --> 00:25:19.837
It'll come after us.

173
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:21.872
But you think there's
only one, right?


174
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:26.677
Well then it's 50/50, and
if it comes after one of us,


175
00:25:26.711 --> 00:25:29.714
the other has a chance to hook
up the blowtorch and get out.


176
00:25:31.381 --> 00:25:32.215
Okay.

177
00:25:44.095 --> 00:25:48.364
If it comes after you
again, you hit it as hard


178
00:25:48.398 --> 00:25:50.735
as you fucking can
with this, okay?


179
00:25:53.704 --> 00:25:55.172
I'll take that end.

180
00:25:56.006 --> 00:25:57.373
You go that way.

181
00:27:30.701 --> 00:27:31.534
You okay?

182
00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.796
Let me out, please!

183
00:27:58.829 --> 00:28:00.164
Let me out out!

184
00:28:02.166 --> 00:28:03.000
Please!

185
00:29:30.421 --> 00:29:32.389
Come out.

186
00:29:32.423 --> 00:29:34.490
Or I go now to your home,

187
00:29:36.026 --> 00:29:37.861
and I kill the infant.

188
00:29:40.463 --> 00:29:42.132
You have 10 seconds.

189
00:29:43.367 --> 00:29:44.201
10.

190
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:46.003
Nine.

191
00:29:47.271 --> 00:29:48.238
Eight.

192
00:29:49.173 --> 00:29:49.974
Shit!

193
00:29:50.007 --> 00:29:50.841
Seven.

194
00:29:52.176 --> 00:29:53.010
Six.

195
00:29:54.411 --> 00:29:55.245
Five.

196
00:29:56.546 --> 00:29:57.381
Four.

197
00:29:59.083 --> 00:29:59.917
Three.

198
00:30:01.151 --> 00:30:02.386
Two.

199
00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:06.023
Stop!

200
00:34:09.166 --> 00:34:11.368
I can see you, you fucker.

201
00:36:13.591 --> 00:36:16.594
You want me to be
scared, don't you?


202
00:36:17.994 --> 00:36:22.299
Well you can fuck off!

203
00:41:23.567 --> 00:41:24.401
Come on!

204
00:41:28.505 --> 00:41:29.339
Shit!

205
00:41:30.941 --> 00:41:31.776
Come on.

206
00:41:37.447 --> 00:41:39.482
Come on, come on!

207
00:41:39.516 --> 00:41:41.018
Please.

208
00:41:41.052 --> 00:41:42.352
Please, come on!

209
00:43:55.085 --> 00:43:58.622
No!

210
00:44:09.733 --> 00:44:13.671
Try to escape
again, the infant dies.


211
00:44:15.505 --> 00:44:16.674
Play the game.

212
00:44:18.374 --> 00:44:19.777
Follow the truth.

213
00:44:31.155 --> 00:44:33.891
Not again, not again, not again.

214
00:44:33.924 --> 00:44:36.426
Not again, not again.

215
00:45:31.048 --> 00:45:31.882
Hey, hey!

216
00:45:33.416 --> 00:45:34.752
Help me, please!

217
00:45:37.187 --> 00:45:39.957
Please, can you
undo these knots!


218
00:45:44.728 --> 00:45:46.697
I just wanted
to look around.


219
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:47.998
I don't want any trouble.

220
00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:54.271
How come you were tied up?

221
00:45:54.305 --> 00:45:55.205
I was kidnapped.

222
00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.342
Listen, the person
who tied me up,


223
00:45:58.375 --> 00:46:00.077
he could be back
here at any moment.


224
00:46:00.110 --> 00:46:01.378
How did you get in here?

225
00:46:01.412 --> 00:46:02.246
I'll show you.

226
00:46:14.124 --> 00:46:15.092
What was that?

227
00:46:15.125 --> 00:46:15.960
Bad news.

228
00:46:17.394 --> 00:46:18.829
If I get caught in here,
my dad's gonna kill me.


229
00:46:18.862 --> 00:46:21.231
If we get caught by the
person who tied me up,


230
00:46:21.265 --> 00:46:23.968
we're both in worse
trouble than that.


231
00:46:24.001 --> 00:46:25.936
How far away from the
jammers do you need to be


232
00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:27.338
to get a signal.

233
00:46:27.371 --> 00:46:29.006
Once I'm past the
fence, I should be okay.


234
00:46:29.039 --> 00:46:31.342
As soon as you get
there, call the police.


235
00:46:31.375 --> 00:46:32.542
Tell them that I'm here.

236
00:46:32.576 --> 00:46:33.777
Tell them that I've
been kidnapped.


237
00:46:33.811 --> 00:46:36.512
Tell them to come
as soon as possible.


238
00:46:36.546 --> 00:46:38.649
Listen, this is serious, okay?

239
00:46:38.682 --> 00:46:39.515
Okay.

240
00:46:40.384 --> 00:46:41.752
What if I get into trouble?

241
00:46:41.785 --> 00:46:42.686
You won't.

242
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:43.519
You promise?

243
00:46:43.553 --> 00:46:44.355
I promise.

244
00:46:44.388 --> 00:46:45.222
Now go!

245
00:50:56.073 --> 00:50:56.873
Hey!

246
00:50:58.275 --> 00:50:59.109
Hey!

247
00:51:00.612 --> 00:51:01.445
Wake up!

248
00:51:06.718 --> 00:51:08.151
Where am I?

249
00:51:08.185 --> 00:51:09.319
It's a factory.

250
00:51:12.322 --> 00:51:14.391
Do you remember anything?

251
00:51:17.127 --> 00:51:19.564
I was at work this morning.

252
00:51:20.964 --> 00:51:25.570
I don't usually work Saturdays,
but I had a client meeting.


253
00:51:30.841 --> 00:51:32.242
The car park was deserted.

254
00:51:34.077 --> 00:51:36.581
I went to get in my car
and someone grabbed me.


255
00:51:36.614 --> 00:51:38.849
The same
thing happened to me.


256
00:51:38.882 --> 00:51:39.783
You're joking.

257
00:51:39.816 --> 00:51:41.686
Am I on a TV show or something?

258
00:51:41.719 --> 00:51:43.553
One girl is
dead, possibly two.


259
00:51:45.155 --> 00:51:45.956
Oh my God.

260
00:51:46.957 --> 00:51:48.559
Phones don't work here.

261
00:51:48.593 --> 00:51:51.528
Listen, the man who kidnapped
you, he thinks I've escaped.


262
00:51:51.562 --> 00:51:52.730
He's gone out to look for me,

263
00:51:52.764 --> 00:51:54.498
but I doubt we have long.

264
00:51:54.531 --> 00:51:55.700
We don't have much time.

265
00:51:57.134 --> 00:51:59.403
Well, there's two of us,
we could overpower him.


266
00:51:59.436 --> 00:52:00.605
You're gonna think I'm nuts,

267
00:52:00.638 --> 00:52:02.873
but he has some kind
of stealth suit.


268
00:52:02.906 --> 00:52:06.043
I know I sound crazy, but I
used to be in the military.


269
00:52:06.076 --> 00:52:08.579
This place, it makes
serious hardware,


270
00:52:08.613 --> 00:52:11.081
quantum stealth armor
plating for tanks.


271
00:52:11.114 --> 00:52:13.016
Things I've never
even seen before.


272
00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:15.352
I heard rumors
about stealth suits


273
00:52:15.385 --> 00:52:17.054
and the advancements...

274
00:52:17.087 --> 00:52:20.223
So who is this person,
does he work here?


275
00:52:20.257 --> 00:52:21.491
I don't know!

276
00:52:24.796 --> 00:52:28.766
What happened to
your face, your arm?


277
00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.801
He did it to me.

278
00:52:31.301 --> 00:52:32.402
He likes to scare you.

279
00:52:33.604 --> 00:52:37.174
And then, when he thinks
you're scared enough,


280
00:52:37.207 --> 00:52:38.576
he gets off on killing you.

281
00:52:42.879 --> 00:52:44.782
You said he
think you've escaped,


282
00:52:44.816 --> 00:52:45.982
so there's a way out?

283
00:52:46.016 --> 00:52:48.852
There is, a disused
ventilation shaft.


284
00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:51.221
Let's go!

285
00:52:53.423 --> 00:52:54.891
Shit, he's coming!

286
00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:58.362
The best thing you
can do is play dead.


287
00:52:58.395 --> 00:52:59.930
He'll want to scare you,
but just play along with it.


288
00:52:59.963 --> 00:53:02.767
He likes to toy with
us, but I promise,


289
00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:04.501
he won't kill you straight away.

290
00:53:05.369 --> 00:53:06.704
He thinks I've escaped.

291
00:53:06.738 --> 00:53:08.305
My guess is he's gonna
come and check on you


292
00:53:08.338 --> 00:53:09.741
and then go again
and look for me.


293
00:53:09.774 --> 00:53:11.041
No, I don't believe you.

294
00:53:11.074 --> 00:53:13.276
What if he's angry and
he takes it out on me?


295
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:14.511
He won't be.

296
00:53:14.544 --> 00:53:16.581
He needs to find me or
he's fucked, believe me.


297
00:53:16.614 --> 00:53:19.282
I am staking my
baby's life on it!


298
00:53:19.316 --> 00:53:20.150
This is so fucked up!

299
00:53:20.183 --> 00:53:22.018
Just do as I say,

300
00:53:22.052 --> 00:53:23.920
and we'll get through this.

301
00:54:51.141 --> 00:54:52.209
Are you okay?

302
00:54:53.276 --> 00:54:54.344
Yeah.

303
00:54:54.377 --> 00:54:55.278
Let's go!

304
00:55:07.792 --> 00:55:09.927
I love my daughter, Amy.

305
00:55:11.328 --> 00:55:14.899
She's five months old.

306
00:55:16.366 --> 00:55:19.971
I had no choice, I had to
go and get her medication,


307
00:55:20.003 --> 00:55:22.339
and I thought I'd only
be gone a few minutes.


308
00:55:23.708 --> 00:55:25.242
That's when he got me.

309
00:55:25.275 --> 00:55:28.144
He said if I try and
escaped, he'd kill her.


310
00:55:28.178 --> 00:55:30.146
I'd rather he was in
here searching for me


311
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.281
than going after her.

312
00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:34.417
Surely someone will hear her.

313
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:37.187
I'm the only single
mum on the Army barracks,


314
00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:38.789
no one's there at the weekends.

315
00:55:42.158 --> 00:55:44.227
I'm sure it'll be okay.

316
00:55:47.464 --> 00:55:48.298
This is it.

317
00:56:00.611 --> 00:56:02.847
Think you can get through there?

318
00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.314
We'll see.

319
00:56:04.347 --> 00:56:06.550
Your phone should work
outside the perimeter fence.


320
00:56:06.584 --> 00:56:08.051
How do you know?

321
00:56:08.084 --> 00:56:09.787
A kid broke in, I told
him to to call the police.


322
00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:11.488
He's the one that
showed me the hole.


323
00:56:11.521 --> 00:56:13.123
Right.

324
00:56:13.156 --> 00:56:14.090
Wish me luck.

325
00:56:24.367 --> 00:56:25.335
What can you see?

326
00:56:26.503 --> 00:56:27.572
A canal.

327
00:56:28.505 --> 00:56:29.707
Beyond that, nothing.

328
00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.809
Looks like we're in
the middle of nowhere.


329
00:56:31.842 --> 00:56:33.044
Can you get across it?

330
00:56:34.311 --> 00:56:35.646
Yeah, I think so.

331
00:56:40.383 --> 00:56:41.151
Oh my God.

332
00:56:41.184 --> 00:56:42.019
What is it?

333
00:56:44.622 --> 00:56:46.791
The boy, he's dead.

334
00:56:49.225 --> 00:56:50.661
Oh God.

335
00:57:00.705 --> 00:57:02.272
Are you okay?

336
00:57:05.141 --> 00:57:05.977
Hello?

337
00:57:09.279 --> 00:57:10.113
Oh!

338
00:57:16.587 --> 00:57:17.420
Okay!

339
00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:24.895
Think, Sam, think, come on!

340
01:00:18.501 --> 01:00:21.238
I know
you are in here.


341
01:00:22.438 --> 01:00:24.108
There is no way out.

342
01:00:26.977 --> 01:00:28.145
Show yourself.

343
01:00:31.447 --> 01:00:35.052
Do it quickly, and I
will kill you quickly.


344
01:00:39.355 --> 01:00:41.659
Resist, and it will be slow.

345
01:00:47.164 --> 01:00:47.965
Resist,

346
01:00:50.901 --> 01:00:54.672
and I will also kill your child.

347
01:00:57.107 --> 01:00:58.075
That is all.

348
01:01:01.111 --> 01:01:03.047
Fat chance, fuckhead!

349
01:08:13.578 --> 01:08:15.412
We need to be quiet.

350
01:08:19.883 --> 01:08:21.051
I played dead.

351
01:08:22.452 --> 01:08:24.821
It doesn't know the difference
as long as you don't move.


352
01:08:24.855 --> 01:08:26.290
I'm impressed.

353
01:08:26.323 --> 01:08:29.661
Before I was a medical rep,
I was a nurse on the side.


354
01:08:29.694 --> 01:08:31.128
I saw a few gunshot wounds.

355
01:08:33.665 --> 01:08:35.299
How did you get out?

356
01:08:35.332 --> 01:08:36.768
I stabbed him.

357
01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.635
He's dead.

358
01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:39.704
He's a janitor.

359
01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:46.009
Must've stolen
stuff that he saw.


360
01:08:46.043 --> 01:08:46.877
Does it work?

361
01:08:48.278 --> 01:08:50.080
I think so, but
the battery's low.


362
01:08:52.516 --> 01:08:54.084
It powers up through the wrist.

363
01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:56.253
It's charging.

364
01:08:57.655 --> 01:08:59.156
Must have two suits.

365
01:08:59.189 --> 01:09:01.726
Switching between them
as the power ran down.


366
01:09:01.759 --> 01:09:03.827
These are
electro-active polymers.


367
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:08.131
Seems that anything
touching the polymers


368
01:09:08.165 --> 01:09:10.568
forms a circuit and
is also cloaked.


369
01:09:13.503 --> 01:09:14.338
You okay?

370
01:09:16.473 --> 01:09:18.008
I'd rather be in
here and in pain


371
01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:19.711
than out there with that thing.

372
01:09:21.011 --> 01:09:22.913
I found a first aid
kit in the kitchen.


373
01:09:24.247 --> 01:09:27.150
The wound's clean so
it won't get infected.


374
01:09:27.184 --> 01:09:28.786
I have to get by on
codeine as a painkiller


375
01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:31.488
till Monday when
the place opens up.


376
01:09:31.521 --> 01:09:33.023
That's not an option for me.

377
01:09:34.191 --> 01:09:36.326
The power level's low,
but you could try it.


378
01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:38.395
Do you think it could
get me past the drone?


379
01:09:38.428 --> 01:09:39.329
Who knows?

380
01:09:41.865 --> 01:09:42.899
I've got no choice.

381
01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.307
This turns it on.

382
01:10:31.481 --> 01:10:33.083
How is it in there?

383
01:10:33.116 --> 01:10:36.453
All right,
apart from the smell.


384
01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.121
Ready.

385
01:11:08.118 --> 01:11:10.287
Can you see me?

386
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:12.189
Not a thing.

387
01:11:12.222 --> 01:11:14.024
It's so freaky.

388
01:11:14.057 --> 01:11:15.693
The power's low.

389
01:11:15.726 --> 01:11:17.160
How much you got?

390
01:11:17.194 --> 01:11:19.229
Five percent.

391
01:11:19.262 --> 01:11:20.631
Better get a move on.

392
01:11:20.665 --> 01:11:21.766
Okay.

393
01:11:23.768 --> 01:11:25.035
Good luck.

394
01:11:25.068 --> 01:11:26.303
Thanks.

395
01:14:17.608 --> 01:14:21.478
Please no!

396
01:15:05.856 --> 01:15:07.792
Police, please,
I was kidnapped.


397
01:15:09.359 --> 01:15:10.895
Two others were kidnapped, too.

398
01:15:12.930 --> 01:15:15.265
At least two people
here are dead.


399
01:15:15.298 --> 01:15:17.568
Four was pinned here.

400
01:15:17.601 --> 01:15:18.435
And two shot.

401
01:15:20.604 --> 01:15:23.540
King Henry Way, it's
a military facility,


402
01:15:23.574 --> 01:15:25.375
King Henry Way near Lemington.

403
01:15:27.011 --> 01:15:29.245
I don't know, some
kind of factory


404
01:15:29.279 --> 01:15:30.848
producing military equipment.

405
01:15:31.982 --> 01:15:34.085
No, it doesn't register
on any of the maps.


406
01:15:35.086 --> 01:15:35.920
Okay.

407
01:15:37.655 --> 01:15:40.958
GPS coordinates are

408
01:15:43.794 --> 01:15:47.131
Yeah, okay, thanks,
but I can't wait here.


409
01:15:47.164 --> 01:15:48.666
My five month old is at home,

410
01:15:48.699 --> 01:15:50.901
and she's been on her own
for two and a half hours.


411
01:15:50.935 --> 01:15:52.636
Yeah, it's all right.

412
01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:54.504
Thank you, please
come quickly, okay.


413
01:16:02.312 --> 01:16:03.814
Berenice, I know
you're gonna kill me,


414
01:16:03.848 --> 01:16:06.183
but if you get this,
get the spare key.


415
01:16:06.217 --> 01:16:07.818
Go to the flat as
soon as possible.


416
01:16:07.852 --> 01:16:09.285
Amy's alone.

417
01:16:09.319 --> 01:16:10.955
I'm not far, I'll be with
you as soon as I can,


418
01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:13.256
and I'll explain everything.

419
01:16:13.289 --> 01:16:14.125
I'm okay.

420
01:16:39.884 --> 01:16:41.152
Please, can you help me?

421
01:16:41.185 --> 01:16:42.887
My baby's alone,
I was kidnapped.


422
01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.420
I need to get back her.

423
01:16:44.454 --> 01:16:46.624
Well, of course, get in.

424
01:16:53.564 --> 01:16:54.899
Do you want me to
call the police, love?


425
01:16:54.932 --> 01:16:56.466
Already have,
they're on their way.


426
01:16:56.499 --> 01:16:57.300
Right.

427
01:18:04.935 --> 01:18:07.771
Oh baby!

428
01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:12.910
Mommy is so sorry she left you.

429
01:18:12.943 --> 01:18:17.882
Hey, hey, Mommy's here, Mommy's
here, Mommy's here, darling!


430
01:18:19.382 --> 01:18:21.118
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

431
01:18:30.327 --> 01:18:34.497
Hello darling.

432
01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:36.000
Where are you?

433
01:18:36.033 --> 01:18:37.500
You're not gonna
believe this, sweetheart,


434
01:18:37.533 --> 01:18:39.535
but I was pulled
over by this girl.


435
01:18:39.570 --> 01:18:41.939
She says she's been
kidnapped.


436
01:18:41.972 --> 01:18:43.340
Right, and
where is that girl now?


437
01:18:43.374 --> 01:18:44.540
Well, I'm outside her flat.

438
01:18:44.575 --> 01:18:45.876
I've just dropped her off.

439
01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:47.745
She says her baby's
been left alone.


440
01:18:47.778 --> 01:18:49.313
I hope she's okay, poor thing.

441
01:18:50.446 --> 01:18:51.882
And have
you called the police?


442
01:18:51.916 --> 01:18:53.250
Well, she says
she's already called them.


443
01:18:53.284 --> 01:18:55.719
You are
so full of shit.


444
01:18:56.887 --> 01:18:58.355
It's true!

445
01:18:58.389 --> 01:19:00.691
Why are you even
at work today at all anyway?


446
01:19:00.724 --> 01:19:02.893
Look, I've already
told you, Pavel didn't come in


447
01:19:02.927 --> 01:19:04.094
for his shift again.

448
01:19:04.128 --> 01:19:06.163
I am sick
of your excuses.


449
01:19:06.196 --> 01:19:08.498
I can't believe that
you're actually hiding


450
01:19:08.531 --> 01:19:10.533
from your wife and
your brother-in-law


451
01:19:10.567 --> 01:19:13.436
like a pathetic little boy.

452
01:19:13.469 --> 01:19:15.706
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

453
01:19:15.739 --> 01:19:18.108
Please, don't be angry with me.

454
01:19:19.243 --> 01:19:21.378
Don't
bother coming home.


455
01:19:39.196 --> 01:19:41.598
It's okay, dear, it's okay.

456
01:20:36.353 --> 01:20:39.056
I've got something
to say to you.


457
01:20:42.693 --> 01:20:44.628
I'm not afraid.

458
01:21:08.287 --> 01:21:13.287
