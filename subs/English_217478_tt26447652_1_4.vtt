1
00:00:01.948 --> 00:00:05.258
We are going to make
our country great again.


2
00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:08.402
Giuliani sees one thing, opportunity.

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.950
Trump is clearly
the best choice.


4
00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.502
He thought, this will put
me back in the spotlight.


5
00:00:13.604 --> 00:00:17.094
What I did for
New York, Donald Trump


6
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.260
will do for America!

7
00:00:19.362 --> 00:00:24.712
[cheers and applause]

8
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:26.401
Oh, my god.

9
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.740
I moved on her, actually.

10
00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:29.155
You know, she was
down in Palm Beach.


11
00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.219
I moved on her, and I failed.

12
00:00:30.328 --> 00:00:31.568
I'll admit it.
- Whoa.


13
00:00:31.673 --> 00:00:32.713
I did try and [bleep] her.

14
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:33.811
She was married.

15
00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:34.984
That's huge news there.

16
00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:36.396
Some breaking news right now.

17
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.090
David Fahrenthold
of The Washington Post


18
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.540
got his hands on a tape.

19
00:00:40.638 --> 00:00:41.568
Hello.
How are you?


20
00:00:41.673 --> 00:00:43.053
Hi.
- Hi, Mr. Trump.


21
00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:44.085
How are you?
- Nice seeing you.


22
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.640
Terrific.
- Pleasure to meet you.


23
00:00:45.742 --> 00:00:47.472
When the Access Hollywood
tape dropped, I was on air.


24
00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:50.259
Donald Trump and Billy
Bush had something


25
00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:52.642
of a raunchy conversation.

26
00:00:52.742 --> 00:00:54.542
And when you're a star,
they let you do it.


27
00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:55.538
You can do anything.

28
00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:56.598
Whatever you want.

29
00:00:56.707 --> 00:00:58.157
Grab 'em by the [bleep].

30
00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:00.569
He's bragging about
committing sexual assault.


31
00:01:00.673 --> 00:01:03.983
So I was just stunned,
absolutely stunned.


32
00:01:04.086 --> 00:01:06.806
There is a political
storm that has erupted.


33
00:01:06.914 --> 00:01:08.644
Already a parade
of Republicans


34
00:01:08.742 --> 00:01:10.812
has either condemned
Trump's comments,


35
00:01:10.914 --> 00:01:13.164
withdrawn their
support completely,


36
00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.289
or called on him to step down.

37
00:01:15.397 --> 00:01:16.637
Any truth that
he's dropping out?


38
00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:17.882
No.

39
00:01:17.983 --> 00:01:19.743
Kellyanne Conway,
Reince Priebus, others,


40
00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:21.945
were scheduled to be
on the Sunday shows.


41
00:01:22.052 --> 00:01:23.982
All of them canceled
their appearances.


42
00:01:24.086 --> 00:01:27.806
And the one person who went on
to defend him in wake of that


43
00:01:27.914 --> 00:01:28.954
was Rudy Giuliani.

44
00:01:29.052 --> 00:01:30.782
Joining me now
is former New York City


45
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.330
mayor and Donald Trump
supporter, Rudy Giuliani.


46
00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:35.161
Rudy Giuliani,
top advisor to Donald Trump.


47
00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.259
Thank you.

48
00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:37.642
Thanks for having me back.

49
00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:39.162
That was a moment
for Rudy Giuliani


50
00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.599
to really step up
and show that was


51
00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:45.327
willing to be Donald Trump's
number one defender,


52
00:01:45.431 --> 00:01:46.601
number one attack dog.

53
00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:48.877
Men at times, talk like that.

54
00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:50.783
I don't know how much
he was exaggerating.


55
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.470
I don't know how much is true.

56
00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:53.849
He's a different man
now than he was then.


57
00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:57.158
Men say stupid things
in locker rooms.


58
00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.399
We should move on.

59
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.220
Rudy Giuliani
bet on Trump when


60
00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:01.848
very few people were doing so.

61
00:02:01.948 --> 00:02:05.358
He stuck with Trump after
the Access Hollywood tape.


62
00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:08.466
Shameful, but like, you know,
you do this because you're


63
00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.539
expecting a reward.

64
00:02:10.638 --> 00:02:12.018
I guess there are
a few perfect people.


65
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.711
But in my view,
there's only been one.


66
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:16.881
And that was Jesus Christ.

67
00:02:16.983 --> 00:02:23.913
â™ª

68
00:02:28.155 --> 00:02:32.395
CNN can report that Hillary
Clinton has called


69
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.880
Donald Trump
to concede the race.


70
00:02:34.983 --> 00:02:36.983
I'm enormously
excited for the country.


71
00:02:37.086 --> 00:02:41.186
I believe Donald Trump will
be a truly great president.


72
00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.883
[dramatic music]

73
00:02:43.983 --> 00:02:45.953
This is probably
one of the greatest


74
00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:50.852
victories for the people of
America since Andrew Jackson.


75
00:02:50.948 --> 00:02:54.638
The election of Donald
Trump to the White House


76
00:02:54.742 --> 00:02:57.912
shocks the country
from coast to coast.


77
00:02:58.017 --> 00:03:00.597
[all cheering]

78
00:03:00.707 --> 00:03:02.597
I'm so proud to
call him the president


79
00:03:02.707 --> 00:03:05.637
of the United States.

80
00:03:05.742 --> 00:03:08.122
Even people who are
pulling for Donald Trump


81
00:03:08.224 --> 00:03:10.434
are amazed that he won.

82
00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:11.945
Whoo!

83
00:03:12.052 --> 00:03:16.192
It felt like this incredible
period of uncertainty.


84
00:03:16.293 --> 00:03:17.433
Who that is that?

85
00:03:17.535 --> 00:03:18.775
Is that the mayor
that showed up?


86
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.090
Rudy?

87
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.780
Morning after the 2016
presidential election,


88
00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.950
if you're Rudy Giuliani,
and Donald Trump had just


89
00:03:26.052 --> 00:03:28.292
been elected president
of United States,


90
00:03:28.397 --> 00:03:31.397
you're feeling that there's
tons of opportunity ahead.


91
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.950
What's your role
expected to be?


92
00:03:33.052 --> 00:03:34.672
I have no expectation.

93
00:03:34.776 --> 00:03:36.016
All I do is give my advice.

94
00:03:36.121 --> 00:03:38.291
Donald's been my
friend for 28 years.


95
00:03:38.397 --> 00:03:42.397
All of my work on behalf of him
has been out of great loyalty


96
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.950
and friendship to him.

97
00:03:44.052 --> 00:03:46.362
Whatever Rudy wants,
Rudy gets, because he was


98
00:03:46.466 --> 00:03:47.846
the guy who stood by Trump.

99
00:03:47.948 --> 00:03:49.848
Whatever he said,
Bill Clinton did much worse.


100
00:03:49.948 --> 00:03:52.398
His top pick
is secretary of state.


101
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.670
So is this true?

102
00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:55.186
You want to be
secretary of state?


103
00:03:55.293 --> 00:03:58.023
[laughs] Whatever I
want to be, I'll discuss


104
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:59.711
with the president-elect.

105
00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:01.981
Rudy has developed a network
of contacts in countries


106
00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:04.186
across the world
in the wake of 9/11


107
00:04:04.293 --> 00:04:07.813
and his geopolitical
rock star status where


108
00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.194
he's treated almost like
an ex-president as he


109
00:04:10.293 --> 00:04:11.643
travels around the world.

110
00:04:11.742 --> 00:04:13.092
I think he thought
being secretary of state


111
00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.670
would be a good way
to stay in the game.


112
00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:16.736
You're not president.

113
00:04:16.845 --> 00:04:18.805
You're not vice president.

114
00:04:18.914 --> 00:04:21.574
Secretary of state is
the most prestigious job


115
00:04:21.673 --> 00:04:23.093
in the cabinet.

116
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.190
And I think that he saw
that as-- as an alternate


117
00:04:25.293 --> 00:04:27.503
to the presidential
ambitions that were


118
00:04:27.604 --> 00:04:29.674
never going to be fulfilled.

119
00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:32.286
John would be
a very good choice.


120
00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.217
Is there anybody better?

121
00:04:33.328 --> 00:04:34.218
Maybe me.

122
00:04:34.328 --> 00:04:35.978
I don't know.

123
00:04:36.086 --> 00:04:37.946
He gets a little too far
out ahead of himself on this.


124
00:04:38.052 --> 00:04:40.362
And what was really
happening behind the scenes


125
00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:43.706
was that there was actually
some concerns about Rudy and--


126
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.021
and whether he was up
for the challenge here.


127
00:04:47.121 --> 00:04:48.981
Trump confidante, Rudy
Giuliani, former New York


128
00:04:49.086 --> 00:04:52.086
mayor, may not actually now
be a lock for the position


129
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.050
of secretary of state.

130
00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:58.085
There's one moment in Trump
Tower where Jason Miller,


131
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.220
one of the top communication
advisors for Trump,


132
00:05:00.328 --> 00:05:02.498
comes out of the bullpen
of his team and says,


133
00:05:02.604 --> 00:05:07.164
we need someone to go in there
and just lob questions at Rudy


134
00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.259
to see what he says.

135
00:05:08.362 --> 00:05:10.162
Everybody scatters.

136
00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.539
The aide who does get picked
goes in behind closed doors


137
00:05:13.638 --> 00:05:15.778
and is horrified
by what he hears,


138
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.540
a question about when
is the last time you've


139
00:05:18.638 --> 00:05:20.668
traveled to the Middle East.

140
00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:23.706
That question comes
with enough stammering


141
00:05:23.811 --> 00:05:25.221
that they have
a follow-up meeting.


142
00:05:25.328 --> 00:05:28.328
The aide asks Giuliani,
you told me


143
00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:32.191
yesterday that you hadn't been
to the Middle East for a year.


144
00:05:32.293 --> 00:05:33.403
Are you sure about that?

145
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.430
Are there any other
trips you can remember?


146
00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:38.735
Giuliani's face goes blank.

147
00:05:38.845 --> 00:05:40.255
Turns out,
his secretary had said


148
00:05:40.362 --> 00:05:44.782
Rudy had just been in the
Middle East a month ago.


149
00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.090
If you talk to people
who were talking to Trump


150
00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.090
at the time, they say he was
never seriously considered


151
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.710
for it, which is probably more
revealing in and of itself


152
00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:56.161
of the dynamic of
the relationship


153
00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.669
between the two of them.

154
00:05:58.776 --> 00:06:01.466
The relationship
between Trump and Rudy


155
00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:02.809
is really a fraught one.

156
00:06:02.914 --> 00:06:05.434
It's one where
Trump really values


157
00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:07.115
Giuliani's defense of him.

158
00:06:07.224 --> 00:06:08.784
He was the best
mayor in the history


159
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.220
of the city of New York.

160
00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:12.428
He's a great person
who loves our country.


161
00:06:12.535 --> 00:06:15.635
But shows his appreciation,
shows his love for Rudy


162
00:06:15.742 --> 00:06:18.602
with backhand and criticisms.

163
00:06:18.707 --> 00:06:20.427
In Donald Trump eye's,
there's


164
00:06:20.535 --> 00:06:21.595
part of Giuliani's record.

165
00:06:21.707 --> 00:06:23.637
Like, he ran for
the presidency,


166
00:06:23.742 --> 00:06:25.222
and it totally
went up in flames.


167
00:06:25.328 --> 00:06:27.498
So to Donald Trump,
he's a loser.


168
00:06:27.604 --> 00:06:30.164
There was a moment after
Trump had been elected,


169
00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:32.219
Steve Mnuchin his new
treasury secretary


170
00:06:32.328 --> 00:06:34.088
is getting married
in Washington,


171
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.640
and Giuliani is very
excitedly talking.


172
00:06:37.742 --> 00:06:39.572
And Trump stops him.

173
00:06:39.673 --> 00:06:41.573
Says, Rudy,
you're spitting all over.


174
00:06:41.673 --> 00:06:44.433
Go stand over there.

175
00:06:44.535 --> 00:06:46.735
And Rudy does.

176
00:06:46.845 --> 00:06:50.015
Rudy thought Trump
was going to appoint


177
00:06:50.121 --> 00:06:51.951
him secretary of state.

178
00:06:52.052 --> 00:06:53.542
And that didn't work.

179
00:06:53.638 --> 00:06:58.048
So he keeps around the
margins in any way he can,


180
00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:02.215
trying to get back to
the center of the action.


181
00:07:02.328 --> 00:07:05.018
One has to really
appreciate to understand


182
00:07:05.121 --> 00:07:09.711
the arc of Rudy Giuliani,
how intoxicating


183
00:07:09.811 --> 00:07:12.051
fame and power are.

184
00:07:12.155 --> 00:07:16.595
For a politician to lose relevance

185
00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:20.467
is gutting.

186
00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.119
What happens to political
and media figures when they


187
00:07:24.224 --> 00:07:29.604
fear irrelevance and
go off the deep end


188
00:07:29.707 --> 00:07:31.807
to become relevant again.

189
00:07:31.914 --> 00:07:34.954
I don't think he
really got over losing


190
00:07:35.052 --> 00:07:36.852
the race for president.

191
00:07:36.948 --> 00:07:38.468
He misses the action.

192
00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:40.669
He wants to be a player.

193
00:07:40.776 --> 00:07:42.876
[dramatic music]

194
00:07:42.983 --> 00:07:44.403
We've got some
major news that we're


195
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.540
still absorbing
as we speak right now


196
00:07:46.638 --> 00:07:47.878
that broke overnight.

197
00:07:47.983 --> 00:07:49.473
A bombshell report from
The New York Times,


198
00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.469
claiming that the FBI
launched an investigation


199
00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:56.779
into President Trump to see
if he was working for Russia


200
00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.120
and against the United States.

201
00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:00.784
Most of Trump's first
two years in office


202
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.360
are overshadowed
by allegations of colluding


203
00:08:03.466 --> 00:08:07.806
with Russia to try to
tilt the 2016 election.


204
00:08:07.914 --> 00:08:12.784
And those eventually land in
the lap of the special counsel


205
00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.290
Robert Mueller.

206
00:08:14.397 --> 00:08:16.907
I said, you know, this
Russia thing with Trump


207
00:08:17.017 --> 00:08:19.117
and Russia is a made-up story.

208
00:08:19.224 --> 00:08:21.054
President needs a fighter.

209
00:08:21.155 --> 00:08:24.015
He needs somebody who
he thinks will push back


210
00:08:24.121 --> 00:08:27.221
against this investigation,
against the press


211
00:08:27.328 --> 00:08:29.288
obsession with
the investigation,


212
00:08:29.397 --> 00:08:32.397
with the same zeal
that he would.


213
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.050
And that is why he calls up
his old friend Rudy Giuliani


214
00:08:36.155 --> 00:08:39.535
and says, I need you
to fight for me here.


215
00:08:49.535 --> 00:08:52.705
It's divorce number
three for Rudy Giuliani,


216
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:54.401
New York City's former mayor.

217
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.290
And at a hearing today,
it became clear that things


218
00:08:57.397 --> 00:08:59.907
are taking a nasty turn.

219
00:09:00.017 --> 00:09:02.777
Since 2016,
you see him without any


220
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.880
of the tethers that guided him
in more productive directions.


221
00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:11.673
Peter Powers was
Rudy's closest confidant


222
00:09:11.776 --> 00:09:13.396
since their boyhood days.

223
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:17.780
If anyone could center him,
it was Peter.


224
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.260
If there was anyone who could
calm him down, it was Peter.


225
00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:26.362
And when Peter died
during the Trump campaign,


226
00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:30.286
Rudy lost his lifeline.

227
00:09:30.397 --> 00:09:34.357
And I think that's
what happens to him.


228
00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:37.946
He's more alone
than early Rudy was.


229
00:09:38.052 --> 00:09:39.912
Rudy Giuliani is
finally an official member


230
00:09:40.017 --> 00:09:41.287
of the Trump team.

231
00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:42.567
The former New York
mayor now joining


232
00:09:42.673 --> 00:09:44.123
the president's legal team.

233
00:09:44.224 --> 00:09:46.094
He wants to do battle the
way he knows how to do battle,


234
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:47.190
which is on Twitter and on TV.

235
00:09:47.293 --> 00:09:48.783
I have no problem with that.

236
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.950
He is treated
differently and unfairly.


237
00:09:50.052 --> 00:09:51.782
- I have no problem with that.
- He's innocent.


238
00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.260
He wants Giuliani,
the prosecutor,


239
00:09:53.362 --> 00:09:56.852
to prosecute the press, to
prosecute the prosecutors.


240
00:09:56.948 --> 00:09:58.638
You've got a hysteria
going on in the media


241
00:09:58.742 --> 00:10:00.602
that interprets everything
against Donald Trump.


242
00:10:00.707 --> 00:10:02.047
There's no hysteria here.

243
00:10:02.155 --> 00:10:04.115
And that is what takes
Giuliani all the way


244
00:10:04.224 --> 00:10:05.574
through the Trump years.
- Wait.


245
00:10:05.673 --> 00:10:06.573
Wait.
- His father-in-law--


246
00:10:06.673 --> 00:10:08.023
Jake-
- Jake, we are so--

247
00:10:08.121 --> 00:10:10.051
we are so distorting
the system of justice


248
00:10:10.155 --> 00:10:11.535
just to get Donald Trump.

249
00:10:11.638 --> 00:10:13.908
It's going to hurt us.

250
00:10:14.017 --> 00:10:15.947
He was spending a lot
of time in the West Wing.


251
00:10:16.052 --> 00:10:17.602
He was somebody
who was constantly


252
00:10:17.707 --> 00:10:20.467
on call for the former
president to reach out to.


253
00:10:20.569 --> 00:10:23.219
And I think this kind
of brought back together


254
00:10:23.328 --> 00:10:25.708
this on-again, off-again
longstanding bromance


255
00:10:25.811 --> 00:10:30.051
between the two of these tough
of a certain era New York men.


256
00:10:30.155 --> 00:10:32.595
He has this direct
access, without any


257
00:10:32.707 --> 00:10:36.087
of the responsibility or
any of the accountability.


258
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.780
As a skilled professional
who figured out


259
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.570
how to climb his way
up in the legal world,


260
00:10:42.673 --> 00:10:45.643
and then up in the political
world, that he figured OK,


261
00:10:45.742 --> 00:10:47.122
now I'm in the Trump world.

262
00:10:47.224 --> 00:10:49.544
What do I need to do to
succeed in this world?


263
00:10:49.638 --> 00:10:56.158
And in this world, loyalty
is 100% obedience, is 100%.


264
00:10:56.259 --> 00:10:58.329
And he just decided,
well, this is


265
00:10:58.431 --> 00:11:02.361
the world I'm going to be in,
and I'm just going to do this.


266
00:11:02.466 --> 00:11:04.596
Almost immediately,
as Giuliani


267
00:11:04.707 --> 00:11:08.807
joins the team in a formal
way, he's doing a lot of press.


268
00:11:08.914 --> 00:11:10.474
When you tell
me that you know,


269
00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:12.469
he should testify because
he's going to tell the truth


270
00:11:12.569 --> 00:11:14.019
and he shouldn't
worry, well, that's so


271
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:15.911
silly because it's
somebody's version


272
00:11:16.017 --> 00:11:17.257
of the truth, not the truth.

273
00:11:17.362 --> 00:11:19.572
He didn't have a
conversation about--


274
00:11:19.673 --> 00:11:20.953
The truth is truth.

275
00:11:21.052 --> 00:11:21.852
I don't mean to go, like, I--
- No!


276
00:11:21.948 --> 00:11:22.848
It isn't truth.

277
00:11:22.948 --> 00:11:24.468
Truth isn't truth.

278
00:11:24.569 --> 00:11:26.779
The president of the United
States says, I didn't.


279
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.190
Truth isn't truth.

280
00:11:28.293 --> 00:11:31.193
Mr. Mayor, do you
realize what, I mean.


281
00:11:31.293 --> 00:11:33.023
There's a moment
inside the White House


282
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:36.471
where Trump aides start
criticizing what Giuliani has


283
00:11:36.569 --> 00:11:41.159
said on air, and Trump
barks at them all and says,


284
00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:45.909
at least Rudy's out
there defending me.


285
00:11:46.017 --> 00:11:46.907
When you do find out?

286
00:11:47.017 --> 00:11:48.047
I'll tell you what.

287
00:11:48.155 --> 00:11:50.155
Rudy knows it's a witch hunt.

288
00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:53.569
He started yesterday.

289
00:11:53.673 --> 00:11:55.093
He'll get his facts straight.

290
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.190
He's a great guy.

291
00:11:57.293 --> 00:12:01.163
In 2018, Joe Biden
is clearly gearing up


292
00:12:01.259 --> 00:12:03.849
for a presidential
run and is widely


293
00:12:03.948 --> 00:12:06.428
perceived as the front-runner.

294
00:12:06.535 --> 00:12:10.255
Remember, in 2007,
when Joe Biden was making


295
00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:12.262
his second run
for the presidency


296
00:12:12.362 --> 00:12:14.602
and Rudy Giuliani
was making his first,


297
00:12:14.707 --> 00:12:17.637
Joe Biden famously in
a Democratic debate


298
00:12:17.742 --> 00:12:19.502
just dismissed Giuliani.

299
00:12:19.604 --> 00:12:21.574
There's only three things
he mentions in a sentence,


300
00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:23.093
a noun, and a verb, and 9/11.

301
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.740
I mean, there's nothing else.

302
00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:28.085
There's nothing else.

303
00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.050
Giuliani never has
gotten over that, ever.


304
00:12:32.155 --> 00:12:34.395
Rudy Giuliani
called former vice


305
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.570
president Joe Biden a moron
and mentally deficient idiot.


306
00:12:39.673 --> 00:12:43.053
I believe that he
always needs to define


307
00:12:43.155 --> 00:12:45.285
himself through anatomy.

308
00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:46.597
Right?

309
00:12:46.707 --> 00:12:49.087
So, Catholic school
he was good and there


310
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.090
were other kids who were bad.

311
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.600
And then he's a
prosecutor and he's


312
00:12:53.707 --> 00:12:55.327
gonna lock up the bad guys.

313
00:12:55.431 --> 00:12:56.671
And then he's mayor
and he's gonna


314
00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.976
lock up the squeegee
guys and jaywalkers,


315
00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:02.216
and now it's Biden.

316
00:13:02.328 --> 00:13:04.568
Rudy starts kind
of from what I


317
00:13:04.673 --> 00:13:10.573
can best say, fancying himself
as like the new Roger Stone.


318
00:13:10.673 --> 00:13:13.473
Opposition research is as
old as the game of politics,


319
00:13:13.569 --> 00:13:15.329
but it's the
lengths he went to.


320
00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:17.951
This is the former
mayor of New York,


321
00:13:18.052 --> 00:13:20.502
this rah-rah
pro-America kind of guy


322
00:13:20.604 --> 00:13:22.264
who was looking
for dirty tricks


323
00:13:22.362 --> 00:13:25.812
to try to harm an American
political opponent


324
00:13:25.914 --> 00:13:29.334
of his friend, Donald Trump.

325
00:13:29.431 --> 00:13:31.951
Giuliani's been doing
business all around the world.


326
00:13:32.052 --> 00:13:34.332
And one of the
places on the map


327
00:13:34.431 --> 00:13:38.851
where he started developing
relationships is Ukraine.


328
00:13:38.948 --> 00:13:43.468
And who was the Obama
administration point person


329
00:13:43.569 --> 00:13:45.669
for dealing with Ukraine?

330
00:13:45.776 --> 00:13:47.496
It was Joe Biden.

331
00:13:47.604 --> 00:13:50.574
Just think about how
rich an opportunity


332
00:13:50.673 --> 00:13:53.983
that is for Rudy Giuliani,
who wants to prove


333
00:13:54.086 --> 00:13:55.736
himself for Donald Trump.

334
00:13:55.845 --> 00:13:59.155
Giuliani had one
aim and one aim only.


335
00:13:59.259 --> 00:14:04.289
And that was how to
[bleep] up Joe Biden.


336
00:14:04.397 --> 00:14:06.327
You can't make this stuff up.

337
00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:09.121
Joe Biden's son,
Hunter Biden,


338
00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:12.194
was making money off of a company

339
00:14:12.293 --> 00:14:14.403
owned by a Ukrainian oligarch.

340
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:19.640
If Giuliani could somehow find
a connection between Joe Biden


341
00:14:19.742 --> 00:14:23.912
taking official action to
help his son enrich himself


342
00:14:24.017 --> 00:14:28.047
in Ukraine, he thinks that's
going to be a golden moment


343
00:14:28.155 --> 00:14:29.845
for Donald Trump.

344
00:14:29.948 --> 00:14:34.048
Over the beginning of 2019,
I start getting texts from Rudy


345
00:14:34.155 --> 00:14:37.115
about Ukraine, texts
about how Hunter


346
00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:39.404
Biden was corrupt
and Ukraine, and


347
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.880
people need to look into this.

348
00:14:40.983 --> 00:14:43.883
At this point,
Giuliani has really left


349
00:14:43.983 --> 00:14:45.813
truth and facts to the side.

350
00:14:45.914 --> 00:14:50.714
He has fully joined the
conspiratorial mentality


351
00:14:50.811 --> 00:14:53.361
of President Trump and
his administration,


352
00:14:53.466 --> 00:14:56.116
totally signed on to that.

353
00:14:56.224 --> 00:14:57.914
Rudy wants to build a case.

354
00:14:58.017 --> 00:15:00.427
So he goes to get evidence.

355
00:15:00.535 --> 00:15:03.735
Now one of the problems is,
is he falls into this murky


356
00:15:03.845 --> 00:15:07.905
world of Russia and
Ukraine and all sorts


357
00:15:08.017 --> 00:15:09.357
of competing agendas.

358
00:15:09.466 --> 00:15:11.846
And he demonstrates
very little discernment


359
00:15:11.948 --> 00:15:14.708
as to who is a reliable
source and who isn't.


360
00:15:14.811 --> 00:15:20.261
The problem is, this wasn't
some backroom deal in Queens.


361
00:15:20.362 --> 00:15:25.642
This was about democracy
in Ukraine surviving.


362
00:15:25.742 --> 00:15:29.362
As Rudy is ramping up
this campaign in Ukraine


363
00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:32.016
to try and get these investigations,

364
00:15:32.121 --> 00:15:34.981
he starts feeling like he's
running into this roadblock.


365
00:15:35.086 --> 00:15:39.536
And that is the US ambassador
to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch.


366
00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:41.188
I heard very, very
bad things about her


367
00:15:41.293 --> 00:15:42.573
for a long period of time.

368
00:15:42.673 --> 00:15:43.883
Not good.

369
00:15:43.983 --> 00:15:45.713
Yovanovitch was recalled
by President Trump


370
00:15:45.811 --> 00:15:48.291
because Rudy Giuliani accused
her of hampering efforts


371
00:15:48.397 --> 00:15:50.707
to dig up dirt on Joe Biden.

372
00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:54.021
Rudy Giuliani was saying that
she was the corrupt one, even


373
00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:55.951
though she was
there pushing back


374
00:15:56.052 --> 00:15:57.782
on corrupt figures in Ukraine.

375
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.980
The taking down, the smearing
and the attempt to destroy


376
00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:07.356
the career of a career foreign
service official for this


377
00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:11.666
obscure political
personal errand,


378
00:16:11.776 --> 00:16:13.666
it was the early
warning signal,


379
00:16:13.776 --> 00:16:17.666
it was the shocking moment of
clarity that should have been,


380
00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:20.156
but wasn't.

381
00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:23.879
The idea that Rudy is this
powerful international wheeler


382
00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:28.543
dealer and that he was going to
go over to Ukraine and he was


383
00:16:28.638 --> 00:16:30.538
going to pull the
strings of power,


384
00:16:30.638 --> 00:16:33.848
this whole thing was shambolic,
it was crapulous, it was just,


385
00:16:33.948 --> 00:16:37.738
it was going to be exactly
the [bleep] show it turned


386
00:16:37.845 --> 00:16:39.325
into from the beginning.

387
00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:50.666
When you make your
decisions based on your pride


388
00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:53.496
or based on your
ego, you can do very


389
00:16:53.604 --> 00:16:55.194
damaging things to yourself.

390
00:16:55.293 --> 00:16:57.713
And so Rudy took that
to the fourth power.


391
00:16:57.811 --> 00:16:59.811
The New York Times reporting
that the president's personal


392
00:16:59.914 --> 00:17:03.164
lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, is
pressing a foreign country,


393
00:17:03.259 --> 00:17:05.159
Ukraine, to take
actions to help


394
00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:07.019
Trump get re-elected in 2020.

395
00:17:07.121 --> 00:17:08.431
This is Giuliani talking.

396
00:17:08.535 --> 00:17:09.665
"We're not meddling
in an election,


397
00:17:09.776 --> 00:17:11.666
we're meddling in
an investigation."


398
00:17:11.776 --> 00:17:13.846
There's nothing
illegal about it.


399
00:17:13.948 --> 00:17:16.428
What Giuliani and
Trump want to happen here


400
00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:18.565
is an investigation
into Hunter Biden.


401
00:17:18.673 --> 00:17:20.983
Both of them view
an investigation


402
00:17:21.086 --> 00:17:22.536
as politically advantageous.

403
00:17:22.638 --> 00:17:24.878
It doesn't really matter
what the outcome is, as long


404
00:17:24.983 --> 00:17:28.643
as they can use that as
a as a political cudgel


405
00:17:28.742 --> 00:17:31.432
against the son of Joe
Biden, who at this point,


406
00:17:31.535 --> 00:17:34.325
is clearly the biggest threat
to a second term


407
00:17:34.431 --> 00:17:35.781
for President Trump.

408
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.810
He's running around
representing himself


409
00:17:37.914 --> 00:17:41.264
as sort of an arm of the State
Department, a representative


410
00:17:41.362 --> 00:17:43.052
of the president.

411
00:17:43.155 --> 00:17:45.775
Giuliani and the people who
are trying to help him started


412
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.290
building relationships with
the people they thought


413
00:17:48.397 --> 00:17:49.907
would be in power.

414
00:17:50.017 --> 00:17:53.257
In the meantime, Ukraine
elects a new president.


415
00:17:53.362 --> 00:17:55.672
Volodymyr Zelenskyy,
an actor best known


416
00:17:55.776 --> 00:17:57.496
for playing the
president of Ukraine,


417
00:17:57.604 --> 00:17:59.094
was elected to
lead that country.


418
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:00.500
I think at this
time, President


419
00:18:00.604 --> 00:18:03.094
Zelenskyy was a
relatively unknown


420
00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:04.570
player on the world stage.

421
00:18:04.673 --> 00:18:06.433
He had won this
election in Ukraine,


422
00:18:06.535 --> 00:18:09.085
but he had this background
as a popular comedian.


423
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.850
[non
-English speech]

424
00:18:10.948 --> 00:18:14.428
Zelensky parlayed this role,
in which a kind of naive,


425
00:18:14.535 --> 00:18:16.595
but well-intentioned
schoolteacher,


426
00:18:16.707 --> 00:18:20.257
becomes the president of
Ukraine, into becoming


427
00:18:20.362 --> 00:18:22.022
the president of Ukraine.

428
00:18:22.121 --> 00:18:26.051
This throws a wrench into the
interests of Rudy Giuliani.


429
00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:29.325
That election creates
a whole new dynamic


430
00:18:29.431 --> 00:18:32.811
that Giuliani then tries
to navigate and game out.


431
00:18:32.914 --> 00:18:36.264
This is in fragile
new government.


432
00:18:36.362 --> 00:18:37.712
Obviously, recent
events show that


433
00:18:37.811 --> 00:18:40.361
there is an external
danger to Ukraine


434
00:18:40.466 --> 00:18:41.906
that they cannot ignore.

435
00:18:42.017 --> 00:18:46.907
The dangle from Rudy
is, we could offer you


436
00:18:47.017 --> 00:18:52.117
a public show of support to
get a meaningful investigation


437
00:18:52.224 --> 00:18:54.334
of Hunter Biden.

438
00:18:54.431 --> 00:18:56.641
Rudolph Giuliani
was not a diplomat.


439
00:18:56.742 --> 00:18:59.402
Rudolph Giuliani was
not an ambassador.


440
00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.980
Rudolph Giuliani was not
the secretary of state.


441
00:19:03.086 --> 00:19:07.156
Rudolph Giuliani was
a hired political gun


442
00:19:07.259 --> 00:19:10.089
working to advance
Donald Trump's


443
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.670
partisan electoral interests.

444
00:19:12.776 --> 00:19:15.256
This scandal is a scandal
of major proportions.


445
00:19:15.362 --> 00:19:16.332
Now, was I--
- Are you done now?


446
00:19:16.431 --> 00:19:17.671
No, I'm not done now?

447
00:19:17.776 --> 00:19:18.776
Because you haven't
said anything.


448
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.880
No.

449
00:19:19.983 --> 00:19:21.813
You can't just
talk the whole time.


450
00:19:21.914 --> 00:19:25.884
Mueller, that July, testifies
in a very clearly lackluster


451
00:19:25.983 --> 00:19:27.573
performance to Congress.

452
00:19:27.673 --> 00:19:34.163
The finding indicates that
the president was not, uh.


453
00:19:34.259 --> 00:19:36.809
Trump not only felt
this sense of exoneration,


454
00:19:36.914 --> 00:19:39.164
he also had this
sense of vengeance.


455
00:19:39.259 --> 00:19:44.809
I think Robert Mueller did
a horrible job both today


456
00:19:44.914 --> 00:19:47.094
and with respect to
the investigation.


457
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.810
He did nothing wrong and he
wasn't involved in collusion,


458
00:19:49.914 --> 00:19:52.434
and he wasn't involved
in obstruction.


459
00:19:52.535 --> 00:19:53.975
And it's in this
mindset, where


460
00:19:54.086 --> 00:19:57.086
that morning, Trump picks
up the phone for a call


461
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:58.950
with President Zelensky.

462
00:19:59.052 --> 00:20:00.852
The President
says, "There's a lot


463
00:20:00.948 --> 00:20:03.328
of talk about Biden's son,
so if you can look into it,


464
00:20:03.431 --> 00:20:05.331
it sounds horrible to me."

465
00:20:05.431 --> 00:20:07.851
Trump spends the
call asking Zelensky


466
00:20:07.948 --> 00:20:12.668
very specifically to help
him investigate Hunter Biden.


467
00:20:12.776 --> 00:20:14.876
White House notes of that
call show that when Zelensky


468
00:20:14.983 --> 00:20:16.983
asked for a shipment
of anti-tank missiles,


469
00:20:17.086 --> 00:20:19.536
Trump countered with
these words, "I would like


470
00:20:19.638 --> 00:20:21.158
you to do us a favor though."

471
00:20:21.259 --> 00:20:24.329
What Zelensky doesn't realize
is, that inside the White


472
00:20:24.431 --> 00:20:30.331
House, Trump has put a hold on
several million dollars of aid


473
00:20:30.431 --> 00:20:34.161
to Ukraine in
anticipation of Zelensky


474
00:20:34.259 --> 00:20:36.809
agreeing to these investigations.

475
00:20:36.914 --> 00:20:38.744
Many of those who are
close to Donald Trump


476
00:20:38.845 --> 00:20:41.325
think that none of this
would have happened


477
00:20:41.431 --> 00:20:42.641
without Rudy Giuliani.

478
00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.912
Ukraine was Giuliani's deal.

479
00:20:46.017 --> 00:20:48.707
These were his connections,
these were his sources,


480
00:20:48.811 --> 00:20:54.161
this was his rogue
foreign policy.


481
00:20:54.259 --> 00:20:57.539
I don't know that I think the
average American at that time


482
00:20:57.638 --> 00:20:59.808
understood why it
was so important


483
00:20:59.914 --> 00:21:02.474
that we give the security
assistance to the Ukrainians.


484
00:21:02.569 --> 00:21:07.469
I think now in 2022 when
Russia is invading Ukraine


485
00:21:07.569 --> 00:21:09.979
and slaughtering innocent
Ukrainian civilians,


486
00:21:10.086 --> 00:21:13.156
our longstanding ally, we
understand why we had a role


487
00:21:13.259 --> 00:21:16.359
and an obligation to do that.

488
00:21:16.466 --> 00:21:18.326
Zelenskyy held firm.

489
00:21:18.431 --> 00:21:21.741
And it was a weird preview
that this young guy who they


490
00:21:21.845 --> 00:21:24.875
thought was a trifle, they
thought, oh, he's a punk,


491
00:21:24.983 --> 00:21:27.673
he's nobody, he's
a comedian, you


492
00:21:27.776 --> 00:21:30.396
know, he just an
accidental president,


493
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.050
he's turned out to
be a greater leader


494
00:21:33.155 --> 00:21:36.215
in a time of terrible,
terrible crisis


495
00:21:36.328 --> 00:21:38.498
than either Trump or Rudy.

496
00:21:38.604 --> 00:21:42.644
[non
-English speech]

497
00:21:42.742 --> 00:21:44.192
The curtain was
lifted today on


498
00:21:44.293 --> 00:21:46.913
an anonymous whistleblower's
explosive complaint


499
00:21:47.017 --> 00:21:49.017
against President
Trump, detailing


500
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:52.021
his ask for political help
from Ukraine's president.


501
00:21:52.121 --> 00:21:54.501
Giuliani is mentioned in
the whistleblower complaint


502
00:21:54.604 --> 00:21:55.784
more than 30 times.

503
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.540
Pointing to that
July phone call


504
00:21:57.638 --> 00:22:00.258
between President Trump
and Ukraine's President.


505
00:22:00.362 --> 00:22:01.672
That was a perfect call.

506
00:22:01.776 --> 00:22:03.536
An absolutely perfect call.

507
00:22:03.638 --> 00:22:04.848
You know it, they all know it.

508
00:22:04.948 --> 00:22:06.808
I'm announcing the
House of Representatives


509
00:22:06.914 --> 00:22:10.814
moving forward with an
official impeachment inquiry.


510
00:22:10.914 --> 00:22:15.224
And everybody's attention
started turning to one man,


511
00:22:15.328 --> 00:22:18.568
and that was Rudy Giuliani.

512
00:22:18.673 --> 00:22:22.263
Rudy's influence led
to Trump's impeachment


513
00:22:22.362 --> 00:22:24.642
over these Ukraine issues.

514
00:22:24.742 --> 00:22:26.812
Again, this
moment of everybody


515
00:22:26.914 --> 00:22:29.434
working to sort of
contain the Rudy influence


516
00:22:29.535 --> 00:22:31.115
and keep him away
from the president


517
00:22:31.224 --> 00:22:34.604
and yet, the president
keeps seeking him out.


518
00:22:34.707 --> 00:22:36.567
Rudy Giuliani is not
a guy who backs down.


519
00:22:36.673 --> 00:22:38.293
Rudy is a guy who doubles down.

520
00:22:38.397 --> 00:22:42.467
Whenever Giuliani was on the
defensive when he was mayor,


521
00:22:42.569 --> 00:22:46.809
his response was to attack.

522
00:22:46.914 --> 00:22:49.854
I don't remember
him ever apologizing,


523
00:22:49.948 --> 00:22:53.118
saying, I shouldn't have
said that or I overreacted.


524
00:22:53.224 --> 00:22:56.604
And you see that throughout
the impeachment process.


525
00:22:56.707 --> 00:22:58.157
What you just said
is totally wrong!


526
00:22:58.259 --> 00:22:59.189
It's not what--

527
00:22:59.293 --> 00:23:00.853
It's completely wrong!

528
00:23:00.948 --> 00:23:02.538
This was a period where
all his friends were kind


529
00:23:02.638 --> 00:23:05.188
of begging him to lay
low, to stop going on TV


530
00:23:05.293 --> 00:23:07.913
and pressing this case,
and he couldn't do it.


531
00:23:08.017 --> 00:23:10.187
I've got the documents,
I've got the proof,


532
00:23:10.293 --> 00:23:11.883
and I've got the witnesses.

533
00:23:11.983 --> 00:23:15.543
One person I spoke to who
met with him around that time


534
00:23:15.638 --> 00:23:18.328
described driving around
in a cab with Rudy,


535
00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:21.121
and Rudy on two occasions
during the same drive


536
00:23:21.224 --> 00:23:24.164
rolled down his window to
high five construction workers


537
00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:25.669
who were waving at him.

538
00:23:25.776 --> 00:23:28.356
Even at the height of
the Ukraine investigation


539
00:23:28.466 --> 00:23:31.496
when you were having all
these administration officials


540
00:23:31.604 --> 00:23:34.954
testify about how horrified
they were by what Rudy had


541
00:23:35.052 --> 00:23:37.432
been doing abroad,
he just seemed to be


542
00:23:37.535 --> 00:23:39.975
having the time of his life.

543
00:23:44.707 --> 00:23:47.287
About 10 days before
the 2020 election,


544
00:23:47.397 --> 00:23:50.807
this clip gets released
of the Borat movie.


545
00:23:50.914 --> 00:23:54.194
You can give me your phone
number and your address.


546
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:01.640
Put down your phone!

547
00:24:01.742 --> 00:24:03.812
She's 15, she too old for you.

548
00:24:03.914 --> 00:24:07.164
It's sort of another blow to
Rudy and to his credibility.


549
00:24:07.259 --> 00:24:09.669
I had to take off the
electronic equipment.


550
00:24:09.776 --> 00:24:11.806
And when the electronic
equipment came off


551
00:24:11.914 --> 00:24:13.814
and I tucked my
shirt in, I assure


552
00:24:13.914 --> 00:24:15.954
you that's all I was doing.

553
00:24:16.052 --> 00:24:18.292
I realize now that
this is a setup.


554
00:24:18.397 --> 00:24:21.397
And then all of a sudden,
crazy Sacha Baron Cohen


555
00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.640
runs in with a cape on and
he's yelling and screaming


556
00:24:23.742 --> 00:24:24.982
all kinds of stupid stuff.

557
00:24:25.086 --> 00:24:27.156
I do recall
thinking at some point


558
00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:30.469
as things went along, that
this was not the person I knew.


559
00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:35.089
Many of the things that he
was doing were just baffling.


560
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:38.220
It's election night in
America and a nation in crisis


561
00:24:38.328 --> 00:24:40.468
is at a crossroads.

562
00:24:40.569 --> 00:24:42.259
Rudy Giuliani
was one of Donald


563
00:24:42.362 --> 00:24:46.572
Trump's most trusted advisors
on election night 2020.


564
00:24:46.673 --> 00:24:49.573
To get there, you had
to be somebody that


565
00:24:49.673 --> 00:24:51.643
told Donald Trump what
he wanted to hear,


566
00:24:51.742 --> 00:24:54.502
not telling him the truth.

567
00:24:54.604 --> 00:24:56.224
The first exit
polls just coming


568
00:24:56.328 --> 00:24:58.878
in tonight, President Trump at
the White House this evening.


569
00:24:58.983 --> 00:25:02.743
Rudy Giuliani understood
something on election night


570
00:25:02.845 --> 00:25:05.845
2020, which many of Donald
Trump's other advisors


571
00:25:05.948 --> 00:25:08.538
did not, which is that
Donald Trump meant it


572
00:25:08.638 --> 00:25:10.878
when he said he
wasn't going to accept


573
00:25:10.983 --> 00:25:13.293
the results of the election.

574
00:25:13.397 --> 00:25:16.537
Trump's second election
night goes much differently


575
00:25:16.638 --> 00:25:18.118
than his first one.

576
00:25:18.224 --> 00:25:21.404
This one, for starters,
is inside the White House.


577
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.160
It's a who's who
of Trump world,


578
00:25:23.259 --> 00:25:26.399
and that guest list, of
course, includes Rudy Giuliani.


579
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:29.880
For the early portion of the
evening, some fairly prominent


580
00:25:29.983 --> 00:25:31.853
reporters were
texting me saying,


581
00:25:31.948 --> 00:25:34.668
wow, it looks like
he might do it again.


582
00:25:34.776 --> 00:25:36.706
I can't wait to
get the results in.


583
00:25:36.811 --> 00:25:38.881
And if he doesn't win?

584
00:25:38.983 --> 00:25:40.643
That's not even an option.

585
00:25:40.742 --> 00:25:42.502
I think he's going
to win by a lot.


586
00:25:42.604 --> 00:25:43.674
That's my interpretation.

587
00:25:43.776 --> 00:25:47.016
all: Four more years!
Four more years!


588
00:25:47.121 --> 00:25:49.361
I was in the East Wing
when the Arizona call came.


589
00:25:49.466 --> 00:25:54.216
Fox News called Arizona, and
that angered all the people


590
00:25:54.328 --> 00:25:55.598
around the president.

591
00:25:55.707 --> 00:25:57.947
And the mood
changed fundamentally.


592
00:25:58.052 --> 00:26:01.602
Giuliani is furiously
scrambling to figure


593
00:26:01.707 --> 00:26:04.637
out how to help the president.

594
00:26:04.742 --> 00:26:07.292
All of the people
yelling suggestions,


595
00:26:07.397 --> 00:26:10.397
Trump not knowing what
to do until one moment


596
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.190
when Rudy Giuliani pipes up
and says, just say you won.


597
00:26:18.052 --> 00:26:20.602
Giuliani once said a
pretty remarkable thing.


598
00:26:20.707 --> 00:26:23.217
He said, you could
throw a fake.


599
00:26:23.328 --> 00:26:28.018
And what he means is, in
politics, you can embellish,


600
00:26:28.121 --> 00:26:31.291
exaggerate, maybe
just throw something


601
00:26:31.397 --> 00:26:34.087
out there that you don't have
any real basis to believe


602
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.780
is true.

603
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:39.120
And that's what he did.

604
00:26:39.224 --> 00:26:42.474
We were getting ready
to win this election.


605
00:26:42.569 --> 00:26:44.909
Frankly, we did
win this election.


606
00:26:45.017 --> 00:26:50.087
[all cheering]
We did win this election.


607
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:51.980
Make no mistake
about it, Donald


608
00:26:52.086 --> 00:26:53.666
Trump himself is delusional.

609
00:26:53.776 --> 00:26:56.846
Rudolph Giuliani helped to
contribute to those delusions


610
00:26:56.948 --> 00:26:59.188
of grandeur that
exists within Donald


611
00:26:59.293 --> 00:27:04.983
Trump's head about the
election being stolen from him.


612
00:27:05.086 --> 00:27:08.016
I think that he
felt like the 1989


613
00:27:08.121 --> 00:27:10.161
election was stolen from
him, that the voting


614
00:27:10.259 --> 00:27:11.599
system was rigged.

615
00:27:11.707 --> 00:27:12.977
A few of my advisors
and other people


616
00:27:13.086 --> 00:27:15.566
that actually came
to see us to urge


617
00:27:15.673 --> 00:27:17.333
me to contest the election.

618
00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:20.781
And they presented us with they
regarded as evidence of voter


619
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.190
tampering, voter fraud.

620
00:27:22.293 --> 00:27:23.813
We see an early
premonition of what we're


621
00:27:23.914 --> 00:27:25.914
going to see years later.

622
00:27:26.017 --> 00:27:28.597
We're living
through I believe,


623
00:27:28.707 --> 00:27:31.847
the worst voter fraud scandal
in the history of our country.


624
00:27:31.948 --> 00:27:33.158
They steal elections
in Detroit.


625
00:27:33.259 --> 00:27:34.469
Representative,
Representative,


626
00:27:34.569 --> 00:27:35.779
you'll have an opportunity--

627
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:37.190
And they steal
elections in New York.


628
00:27:37.293 --> 00:27:39.193
President Trump has
put his personal lawyer,


629
00:27:39.293 --> 00:27:41.433
Rudy Giuliani, in charge of his
campaign's election lawsuits.


630
00:27:41.535 --> 00:27:45.085
Giuliani becomes a real
central figure for Trump


631
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.980
as Trump is beginning
to devise any strategy


632
00:27:49.086 --> 00:27:50.536
to hold on to power.

633
00:27:50.638 --> 00:27:52.358
Giuliani, who's been on
the road in four states,


634
00:27:52.466 --> 00:27:54.596
leading the president's
election challenge.


635
00:27:54.707 --> 00:27:57.637
His team has already
filed lawsuits in Michigan,


636
00:27:57.742 --> 00:27:59.192
Georgia, and Pennsylvania.

637
00:27:59.293 --> 00:28:01.743
We are going to
continue the lawsuit here.


638
00:28:01.845 --> 00:28:03.255
We're going to
bring a second one,


639
00:28:03.362 --> 00:28:05.092
and then we're going to
bring a federal lawsuit.


640
00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:09.540
I don't think he believed
that Trump won the election.


641
00:28:09.638 --> 00:28:12.638
I don't think he believes that
Trump was a great president


642
00:28:12.742 --> 00:28:14.332
or a lousy one.

643
00:28:14.431 --> 00:28:16.741
I think this is
immaterial to him.


644
00:28:16.845 --> 00:28:19.665
What's material, is
that he's standing


645
00:28:19.776 --> 00:28:22.666
up there talking
about Donald Trump


646
00:28:22.776 --> 00:28:25.496
before thousands of people.

647
00:28:25.604 --> 00:28:28.404
Giuliani, he's on
television constantly,


648
00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.190
he's holding bizarre
press conferences,


649
00:28:31.293 --> 00:28:36.163
like the never to be forgotten
Four Seasons Landscaping


650
00:28:36.259 --> 00:28:37.259
press conference.

651
00:28:37.362 --> 00:28:39.262
Trump tweets
that there's going


652
00:28:39.362 --> 00:28:43.222
to be a press conference by his
attorneys at the Four Seasons.


653
00:28:43.328 --> 00:28:45.048
Two minutes after that,
he deleted the first tweet


654
00:28:45.155 --> 00:28:46.975
and started over,
quote, "Big press


655
00:28:47.086 --> 00:28:48.636
conference today in
Philadelphia at Four


656
00:28:48.742 --> 00:28:51.122
Seasons Total Landscaping."

657
00:28:51.224 --> 00:28:52.984
Oh, that Four
Seasons, of course.


658
00:28:53.086 --> 00:28:56.116
He means Four Seasons Total
Landscaping, located just


659
00:28:56.224 --> 00:28:58.124
down the block from
Fantasy Island adult books


660
00:28:58.224 --> 00:29:00.914
and video store, and across
the street from the Delaware


661
00:29:01.017 --> 00:29:03.467
Valley Cremation Center.

662
00:29:03.569 --> 00:29:07.739
It's so embarrassing,
you couldn't even write it.


663
00:29:07.845 --> 00:29:12.045
700,000 votes
that disappeared.


664
00:29:12.155 --> 00:29:15.465
Giuliani is insisting that
they will continue to fight


665
00:29:15.569 --> 00:29:19.159
when a reporter interrupts
him and tells him


666
00:29:19.259 --> 00:29:21.979
that the election
had been called.


667
00:29:22.086 --> 00:29:23.156
Who was it called by?

668
00:29:23.259 --> 00:29:24.879
- All of them.
- All of them!


669
00:29:24.983 --> 00:29:25.953
Oh, my goodness!

670
00:29:26.052 --> 00:29:28.052
All the networks!

671
00:29:28.155 --> 00:29:30.565
Wow!

672
00:29:30.673 --> 00:29:32.403
All the networks!

673
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.640
Of course, it would end up
like this, with Rudy Giuliani


674
00:29:34.742 --> 00:29:36.982
making an ass of
himself while Donald


675
00:29:37.086 --> 00:29:39.906
Trump officially
loses the presidency


676
00:29:40.017 --> 00:29:45.117
and is on the golf course.

677
00:29:45.224 --> 00:29:47.124
This legal team, a.k.a.

678
00:29:47.224 --> 00:29:51.294
the clown car of incompetence,
has now lost close to 50 cases


679
00:29:51.397 --> 00:29:52.637
in a month.

680
00:29:52.742 --> 00:29:54.642
Most of them,
I mean, basically


681
00:29:54.742 --> 00:29:56.292
laughed out of court.

682
00:29:56.397 --> 00:29:58.497
Inside courtrooms,
nearly every single attempt


683
00:29:58.604 --> 00:30:02.334
from Trump, the Trump
campaign and his allies


684
00:30:02.431 --> 00:30:06.981
are rebuked by judges, who want
to see some measure of proof


685
00:30:07.086 --> 00:30:09.046
that simply doesn't exist.

686
00:30:09.155 --> 00:30:12.285
Dismissals in Michigan,
Georgia, Nevada, Arizona,


687
00:30:12.397 --> 00:30:15.637
and I'll tell you, it's rare
to see courts throw out cases


688
00:30:15.742 --> 00:30:16.812
this quickly.

689
00:30:16.914 --> 00:30:18.404
We're going to
stick with this,


690
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.640
we're going to
win this election.


691
00:30:19.742 --> 00:30:21.472
We've actually won it.

692
00:30:21.569 --> 00:30:25.089
And I believe Biden and his
crew tried to steal the votes.


693
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.980
I believe it is totally fraud.

694
00:30:27.086 --> 00:30:29.876
I'm just not
believing that Biden


695
00:30:29.983 --> 00:30:31.643
won in any way, shape or form.

696
00:30:31.742 --> 00:30:33.782
Everybody knows
they stole it.


697
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:35.740
Recount, recount, recount!

698
00:30:35.845 --> 00:30:39.285
There's this drumbeat coming
from Trump, coming from Rudy,


699
00:30:39.397 --> 00:30:41.327
coming from a lot
of their supporters,


700
00:30:41.431 --> 00:30:43.951
of this election is
fake, we need to stand up


701
00:30:44.052 --> 00:30:47.292
for voters and for the
integrity of our elections


702
00:30:47.397 --> 00:30:48.707
and we need to stop
this from happening.


703
00:30:48.811 --> 00:30:51.431
Stop the steal,
stop the steal.


704
00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.640
One of the clearest
inflection points in that post


705
00:31:04.742 --> 00:31:07.982
election period for Giuliani
is that famous press


706
00:31:08.086 --> 00:31:12.256
conference at the Republican
National Committee.


707
00:31:12.362 --> 00:31:13.502
Good afternoon.

708
00:31:13.604 --> 00:31:15.744
I mean, this is I think,
the clearest picture


709
00:31:15.845 --> 00:31:18.805
Americans have gotten
of Rudy Giuliani


710
00:31:18.914 --> 00:31:20.814
totally detached from reality.

711
00:31:20.914 --> 00:31:25.264
This to me, is
the button to that


712
00:31:25.362 --> 00:31:29.542
rise and fall that we
talk about over Giuliani's


713
00:31:29.638 --> 00:31:30.808
public life.

714
00:31:30.914 --> 00:31:33.474
Did you all watch
My Cousin Vinny?


715
00:31:33.569 --> 00:31:34.809
You know, the movie?

716
00:31:34.914 --> 00:31:36.264
It's one of my
favorite law movies,


717
00:31:36.362 --> 00:31:37.782
because he comes from Brooklyn.

718
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.260
I don't like to mock
people or anything like that.


719
00:31:41.362 --> 00:31:43.882
I actually do remember
thinking in that moment,


720
00:31:43.983 --> 00:31:46.743
why is his family
letting him do this?


721
00:31:46.845 --> 00:31:49.355
I prosecuted some of the
most dangerous criminals


722
00:31:49.466 --> 00:31:50.876
in the world.

723
00:31:50.983 --> 00:31:52.023
I know crimes.

724
00:31:52.121 --> 00:31:53.571
I can smell them.

725
00:31:53.673 --> 00:31:56.193
This is a man who is a
student of American history,


726
00:31:56.293 --> 00:32:00.223
who could have
given you lectures


727
00:32:00.328 --> 00:32:03.878
about our democracy
and the need


728
00:32:03.983 --> 00:32:07.193
for a peaceful
transfer of power.


729
00:32:07.293 --> 00:32:12.643
You know, we use largely
Venezuelan voting machine


730
00:32:12.742 --> 00:32:15.192
in essence to count our vote.

731
00:32:15.293 --> 00:32:17.743
We let this happen, we're
going to become Venezuela.


732
00:32:17.845 --> 00:32:21.535
He's too smart to believe
some of the nonsense


733
00:32:21.638 --> 00:32:23.218
that he's been spouting.

734
00:32:23.328 --> 00:32:25.848
You know, the monkey
business with the ballots


735
00:32:25.948 --> 00:32:28.288
and Venezuela being involved.

736
00:32:28.397 --> 00:32:34.047
I mean, this is
just nutty stuff.


737
00:32:34.155 --> 00:32:39.565
Fast forward to hair
dye running down his face.


738
00:32:39.673 --> 00:32:42.713
So the only evidence
that Rudy has uncovered,


739
00:32:42.811 --> 00:32:44.811
is that he's not a
natural brunette.


740
00:32:44.914 --> 00:32:48.094
I could tell you the second
he saw that line of makeup


741
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:49.470
or hair gel or
whatever the hell


742
00:32:49.569 --> 00:32:52.189
it was oozing off
of Rudy's head,


743
00:32:52.293 --> 00:32:54.403
that Donald Trump, a man
with a more than passing


744
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.640
acquaintance with makeup,
immediately wrote Rudy off.


745
00:32:58.742 --> 00:33:00.542
You know your legal
strategy is [bleep] up,


746
00:33:00.638 --> 00:33:03.258
when even your hair
starts crying about it.


747
00:33:03.362 --> 00:33:06.092
He's lost capacity for shame.

748
00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.120
And shame as a
self-regulating function.


749
00:33:09.224 --> 00:33:11.434
In Giuliani's case,
earlier in his career


750
00:33:11.535 --> 00:33:14.395
I think this actually
served the public interest


751
00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:16.120
fairly well.

752
00:33:16.224 --> 00:33:18.474
That moment is now long
gone, and he's just


753
00:33:18.569 --> 00:33:21.739
a man with lots and lots
of pie in his face to go


754
00:33:21.845 --> 00:33:23.395
with the dripping hair dye.

755
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.430
And you know, the
general sense of like,


756
00:33:25.535 --> 00:33:28.635
a corroded and
decayed human being.


757
00:33:28.742 --> 00:33:32.472
The menace gets lost
in the clown show.


758
00:33:32.569 --> 00:33:34.359
He's standing
there perpetrating


759
00:33:34.466 --> 00:33:37.946
a big lie about
our most sacrosanct


760
00:33:38.052 --> 00:33:39.952
thing, which is our democracy.

761
00:33:40.052 --> 00:33:42.362
Yet, it actually is
the genesis of what


762
00:33:42.466 --> 00:33:47.496
came closer to an American
coup than we've ever had.


763
00:33:49.397 --> 00:33:51.847
We are the majority!

764
00:33:51.948 --> 00:33:53.778
And Trump won!

765
00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.540
Trump won!
Trump won!


766
00:33:56.638 --> 00:33:59.188
The night before
January 6, rally


767
00:33:59.293 --> 00:34:01.263
goers had started assembling.

768
00:34:01.362 --> 00:34:02.852
And I can tell
you to this day,


769
00:34:02.948 --> 00:34:05.428
Donald Trump won the election.

770
00:34:05.535 --> 00:34:07.665
[cheering]

771
00:34:07.776 --> 00:34:10.666
They were so loud, that Trump
could hear them in the Oval


772
00:34:10.776 --> 00:34:11.736
Office that evening.

773
00:34:11.845 --> 00:34:15.355
[all cheering]

774
00:34:15.466 --> 00:34:18.706
Trump opened the doors on
this chilly January evening


775
00:34:18.811 --> 00:34:21.641
and started calling
aides into his office.


776
00:34:21.742 --> 00:34:23.362
Can you hear them
outside, he'd ask.


777
00:34:23.466 --> 00:34:25.596
Can you hear how
excited they are?


778
00:34:25.707 --> 00:34:28.907
[cheering]

779
00:34:29.017 --> 00:34:31.117
I woke up that
morning and you know,


780
00:34:31.224 --> 00:34:34.544
there was a sense of real
menace in Washington,


781
00:34:34.638 --> 00:34:37.638
and there had been
for a couple days.


782
00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:40.852
[all cheering]

783
00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:43.848
There is a new Republican
Party on the rise.


784
00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.498
We're coming for
you, and we're going


785
00:34:45.604 --> 00:34:47.434
to have a good time doing it.

786
00:34:47.535 --> 00:34:52.045
This is the greatest group
of patriots ever put together.


787
00:34:52.155 --> 00:34:54.085
What does Giuliani
do on January 6?


788
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:56.980
Please welcome
America's mayor, Rudy.


789
00:34:57.086 --> 00:34:58.426
Giuliani.

790
00:34:58.535 --> 00:35:01.085
He takes the stage at
the Stop the Steal rally


791
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:02.360
on the ellipse.

792
00:35:02.466 --> 00:35:04.706
Just south of the
White House, you


793
00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:07.401
can see the White
House in the distance,


794
00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.430
and he fires up this crowd.

795
00:35:11.535 --> 00:35:14.215
This has been a year in
which they have invaded


796
00:35:14.328 --> 00:35:17.218
our freedom of speech,
our freedom of religion,


797
00:35:17.328 --> 00:35:20.088
our freedom to move,
our freedom to live.


798
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.850
I'll be darned if
they're going to take


799
00:35:21.948 --> 00:35:24.668
away our free and fair vote!

800
00:35:24.776 --> 00:35:26.326
And we're going to
fight to the very end


801
00:35:26.431 --> 00:35:28.571
to make sure that
doesn't happen.


802
00:35:28.673 --> 00:35:33.403
Over the next 10 days, we
get to see the machines that


803
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:36.430
are crooked, the ballots
that are fraudulent,


804
00:35:36.535 --> 00:35:40.845
and if we're wrong,
we will be made fools of.


805
00:35:40.948 --> 00:35:44.088
But if we're right, a lot
of them will go to jail.


806
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:48.120
[cheering]

807
00:35:48.224 --> 00:35:53.604
So let's have trial by combat!

808
00:35:53.707 --> 00:35:56.467
Rudy Giuliani arguing that
he wasn't literally advocating


809
00:35:56.569 --> 00:35:59.119
for insurrection when
he spoke at a pro-Trump


810
00:35:59.224 --> 00:36:02.474
rally in Washington just before
rioters stormed the Capitol.


811
00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:08.289
When I heard him
say, trial by combat,


812
00:36:08.397 --> 00:36:11.847
that was decisive for me.

813
00:36:11.948 --> 00:36:16.398
He absolutely enabled an
attack on our democracy


814
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.600
and tried to
overturn an election.


815
00:36:19.707 --> 00:36:21.257
And that's just a
civic sin that's


816
00:36:21.362 --> 00:36:23.122
completely unforgivable.

817
00:36:23.224 --> 00:36:25.474
all: Rudy, Rudy, Rudy.

818
00:36:25.569 --> 00:36:28.469
When you see him being
one of the speakers leading


819
00:36:28.569 --> 00:36:33.469
into January 6, look at the
footage of the police riot


820
00:36:33.569 --> 00:36:35.779
when Dave Dinkins was mayor.

821
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.430
That's who Rudy was.

822
00:36:37.535 --> 00:36:40.805
He's just not able to
finesse it like he used to.


823
00:36:40.914 --> 00:36:44.334
But that's Rudy.

824
00:36:44.431 --> 00:36:46.851
We're going to walk
down to the Capitol.


825
00:36:46.948 --> 00:36:49.878
[all shouting]

826
00:37:00.362 --> 00:37:03.502
[all shouting]

827
00:37:09.017 --> 00:37:13.597
Trump and Giuliani showed,
as the whole Trump presidency


828
00:37:13.707 --> 00:37:18.737
showed, that a small, smaller
than you think minority,


829
00:37:18.845 --> 00:37:23.905
could wreak absolute havoc
with the American system.


830
00:37:24.017 --> 00:37:25.087
[all shouting]

831
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.360
They're protecting her.

832
00:37:26.466 --> 00:37:28.286
Not if he wants in!

833
00:37:28.397 --> 00:37:30.637
all: We want Trump,
we want Trump,


834
00:37:30.742 --> 00:37:33.162
we want Trump,
we want Trump,


835
00:37:33.259 --> 00:37:34.669
we want Trump.

836
00:37:34.776 --> 00:37:37.466
For somebody who once
championed the rule of law


837
00:37:37.569 --> 00:37:43.469
and tried his cases in court,
for him to be the instrument


838
00:37:43.569 --> 00:37:47.979
of--of essentially
undermining the system of law


839
00:37:48.086 --> 00:37:52.156
and having people lose
faith in our democracy


840
00:37:52.259 --> 00:37:54.739
is a horrible way
to end your career.


841
00:37:54.845 --> 00:37:57.735
Because of the damage
that you have already


842
00:37:57.845 --> 00:38:01.285
done to our system and
even greater danger


843
00:38:01.397 --> 00:38:07.707
that may lie ahead.

844
00:38:07.811 --> 00:38:09.051
[all shouting]

845
00:38:09.155 --> 00:38:11.945
Hey, Giuliani, [bleep] you!

846
00:38:12.052 --> 00:38:13.402
Yeah, [bleep] you.

847
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:20.220
He's just fallen so
far, and he keeps falling.


848
00:38:20.328 --> 00:38:24.218
So the only thing
that kind of ties


849
00:38:24.328 --> 00:38:29.218
it all together is that people
are still talking about him.


850
00:38:29.328 --> 00:38:32.428
Whether he's going up
or he's going down,


851
00:38:32.535 --> 00:38:34.875
he's in the conversation.

852
00:38:34.983 --> 00:38:39.363
And maybe that's what
it's all about for him.


853
00:38:39.466 --> 00:38:41.636
Now he once told a
reporter, you know,


854
00:38:41.742 --> 00:38:44.292
whatever, whatever
they say about me,


855
00:38:44.397 --> 00:38:46.397
I'll be dead one
day, I don't care.


856
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.260
And that may be true.

857
00:38:48.362 --> 00:38:53.262
But he's still alive and he
still has to think about it.


858
00:38:53.362 --> 00:38:54.812
My father would
say to me, when


859
00:38:54.914 --> 00:38:56.644
you make a decision, the
most important thing you've


860
00:38:56.742 --> 00:38:58.122
got to think about is, can
you shave the next morning


861
00:38:58.224 --> 00:38:59.294
and look at yourself
in the mirror


862
00:38:59.397 --> 00:39:01.597
and feel good about yourself.

863
00:39:24.638 --> 00:39:29.018
I do not think that
Rudy Giuliani understands


864
00:39:29.121 --> 00:39:31.261
that there has been
a tremendous erosion


865
00:39:31.362 --> 00:39:36.402
of his reputation that
he has caused at all.


866
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:40.220
He looks in the mirror and
he sees the hero of 9/11.


867
00:39:40.328 --> 00:39:42.708
And those of us
who are here have


868
00:39:42.811 --> 00:39:46.851
to defend freedom by going
about our lives unafraid.


869
00:39:51.362 --> 00:39:55.852
I saw him walking down
the street about two weeks


870
00:39:55.948 --> 00:40:00.188
after they raided his house.

871
00:40:00.293 --> 00:40:03.223
I looked out the side
of the car and I said,


872
00:40:03.328 --> 00:40:05.218
here's Giuliani.

873
00:40:05.328 --> 00:40:07.188
I didn't even roll
the window down.


874
00:40:07.293 --> 00:40:11.053
It would have been beyond even
me to be able to predict he'd


875
00:40:11.155 --> 00:40:14.635
end up the way he's ended up.

876
00:40:14.742 --> 00:40:18.292
Here's a man now who got
there with divisiveness


877
00:40:18.397 --> 00:40:22.287
and polarizing,
and by some luck,


878
00:40:22.397 --> 00:40:27.087
was able to resurrect himself
to being the nation's mayor.


879
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:31.090
Got a second chance,
and then he erodes it all.


880
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.360
It is almost unthinkable.

881
00:40:33.466 --> 00:40:36.736
At the end of the
day, Rudy Giuliani


882
00:40:36.845 --> 00:40:40.185
was not brought down by
those of us that opposed him.


883
00:40:40.293 --> 00:40:43.403
He was not brought
down by his critics.


884
00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:46.740
Rudy Giuliani was brought
down by Rudy Giuliani.


885
00:40:46.845 --> 00:40:49.735
[somber piano music]

886
00:40:49.845 --> 00:40:55.255
â™ª

887
00:40:55.362 --> 00:41:01.262
If Rudy had left public life

888
00:41:01.362 --> 00:41:06.262
either after 9/11
or after 2008,


889
00:41:06.362 --> 00:41:09.162
when he
dies in a few years,


890
00:41:09.259 --> 00:41:12.159
they would name high
schools after him.


891
00:41:12.259 --> 00:41:14.089
They would rename LaGuardia
Airport after him.


892
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:16.910
He would go down as a complex,

893
00:41:17.017 --> 00:41:21.427
weird, funny, strange,

894
00:41:21.535 --> 00:41:25.635
highly accomplished guy,
who at two key inflection


895
00:41:25.742 --> 00:41:31.642
points in history, stood up and
offered powerful leadership.


896
00:41:31.742 --> 00:41:35.262
That man's gone, unfortunately.

897
00:41:35.362 --> 00:41:37.162
It's tragic.
