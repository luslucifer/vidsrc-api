1
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.290
Ever since i was a kid.

2
00:02:22.681 --> 00:02:24.940
Things have been happening.

3
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.820
Strange

4
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.230
strange things have
been happening to me.


5
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.090
It.

6
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.600
I just.

7
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.030
Never really figured out how to

8
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.450
talk about it.

9
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.320
Filming a documentary.

10
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.210
I'm using gopros

11
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.320
iPhones.

12
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:53.260
Bigger plan.

13
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.230
Is posted all on YouTube.

14
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.930
Let everybody see the
what's been going on.


15
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.380
This.

16
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.550
Will explain everything.

17
00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.880
So i'm out here at
the county junkyard.


18
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.480
During a couple of tests

19
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.740
i got my hack him.

20
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.612
I've got this scam.

21
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.920
I got this new tool.

22
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.760
That is supposed
to bust out a window


23
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.900
the first try.

24
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.610
And.

25
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.940
I'm gonna find out
who's been behind those.


26
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.290
Tinted windows in
my neighborhood.


27
00:03:33.896 --> 00:03:35.050
We go.

28
00:03:37.304 --> 00:03:38.304
One.

29
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.130
Three tries.

30
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.600
One around the corner.

31
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.910
Guy.

32
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.620
These window i busted out today.

33
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.822
Then you wrong.

34
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.010
Sorry.

35
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.740
And fortunately.

36
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.840
Your car just so happen to look like
one of the cars I've been looking for.


37
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Today.

38
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.650
I was wrong.

39
00:05:16.885 --> 00:05:17.588
[Dog barking]

40
00:05:17.755 --> 00:05:17.968
[Bark]

41
00:05:18.158 --> 00:05:18.338
[Bark]

42
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.810
[Bark]

43
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.620
Next time.

44
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.810
[Bark]

45
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.215
[Bark]

46
00:05:22.808 --> 00:05:23.012
[Bark]

47
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.440
I am not going to be wrong.

48
00:05:27.883 --> 00:05:29.106
[Bark] [Bark].

49
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.700
[Bark].

50
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.330
[Bark]

51
00:05:49.227 --> 00:05:49.740
Come out.

52
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:51.490
Come out.

53
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.570
I know you're not
going to believe this.


54
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.260
I've been abducted
by aliens my whole life.


55
00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.270
Guesswork.

56
00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.570
Found a way to recording.

57
00:07:19.561 --> 00:07:21.550
I hit a tiny micro camera.

58
00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:23.380
Instead of my hearing implant.

59
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:25.870
And no one knows
that it's there.


60
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.840
Recording is done actions.

61
00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.910
In high definition.

62
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.820
Color

63
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.300
and.

64
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.900
Stuff i got.

65
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.208
It's all messed up.

66
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:47.806
You're going to see
what I've been seeing


67
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.839
and I've got.

68
00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.670
Already got.

69
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.284
Kind of place i go to.

70
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.770
When they dig deep into my mind.

71
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.350
Focus on.

72
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880
Smack.

73
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.850
Noises.

74
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.550
Advantages.

75
00:10:09.536 --> 00:10:10.966
And.

76
00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:13.116
I've always made me feel.

77
00:10:20.966 --> 00:10:22.536
Need to have work done.

78
00:10:23.036 --> 00:10:24.186
By Monday.

79
00:10:56.036 --> 00:10:57.306
Monday okay.

80
00:11:03.086 --> 00:11:04.596
Mondays do so.

81
00:13:49.646 --> 00:13:51.606
There are these
unusual vehicles.


82
00:13:51.776 --> 00:13:54.086
Sporty modified cars with dark

83
00:13:54.206 --> 00:13:56.196
blacked out tinted windows.

84
00:13:56.426 --> 00:13:58.226
The strange numbered
license plates.


85
00:13:58.706 --> 00:14:01.536
Sort of like foreign plates
or government plates.


86
00:14:06.296 --> 00:14:07.296
Fallen.

87
00:14:07.616 --> 00:14:10.146
There watching me
modern from a distance.


88
00:14:10.736 --> 00:14:12.786
It's been going on.

89
00:14:13.526 --> 00:14:15.096
Maybe my whole life.

90
00:14:15.656 --> 00:14:17.426
Often i catch one out
of the corner of my eye.


91
00:14:18.026 --> 00:14:21.906
For just a moment before speeds around
a corner and disappears out of sight.


92
00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:24.546
What was in those cars.

93
00:14:25.256 --> 00:14:27.846
What's behind the
blacked out windows.


94
00:14:28.526 --> 00:14:30.276
Who's watching me.

95
00:14:31.016 --> 00:14:32.586
Is it one of them.

96
00:14:33.116 --> 00:14:34.656
Or is it one of us.

97
00:15:08.262 --> 00:15:13.971
Oh.

98
00:15:15.536 --> 00:15:18.456
My first footage ever was
from a tiny medical camera.


99
00:15:18.777 --> 00:15:20.276
Image quality just
wasn't good enough.


100
00:15:20.966 --> 00:15:23.306
When i got it though i
immediately posted it on YouTube.


101
00:15:23.666 --> 00:15:25.106
Thinking it would
go viral right away.


102
00:15:25.436 --> 00:15:27.036
Check out some
of these comments.


103
00:15:28.436 --> 00:15:30.756
Nice job with the
Photoshop digweed.


104
00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:32.706
Seriously creepy buffet.

105
00:15:33.236 --> 00:15:34.106
Ugly dog

106
00:15:34.316 --> 00:15:35.486
not convincing at all

107
00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:39.686
stop posting loser aliens
are real this is the shit


108
00:15:39.689 --> 00:15:41.676
that ruins the Internet and
the cause we all believe it.


109
00:15:42.686 --> 00:15:44.126
I'm not sure what i'm
supposed to be seeing


110
00:15:44.396 --> 00:15:47.226
really do think we're
all that dumb pos.


111
00:15:47.996 --> 00:15:49.836
So i rebuilt my implant.

112
00:15:50.636 --> 00:15:52.766
One i got now is a
modified micro camera


113
00:15:52.976 --> 00:15:54.426
cell phone optics.

114
00:15:54.596 --> 00:15:57.516
Also programmed to
record a random burst.


115
00:15:57.566 --> 00:15:59.916
That way i dunno it's reporting.

116
00:16:00.298 --> 00:16:00.626
Don't data

117
00:16:00.836 --> 00:16:01.836
recording.

118
00:16:42.806 --> 00:16:44.376
So i work with electronics.

119
00:16:45.326 --> 00:16:47.856
The thing about
electronics is they disabled.


120
00:16:48.086 --> 00:16:49.086
Always.

121
00:16:49.346 --> 00:16:52.406
Any electronics anything mechanical
is always disabled when they take you.


122
00:16:52.796 --> 00:16:53.426
That's what they do.

123
00:16:53.996 --> 00:16:56.886
But interbody components like
pacemakers and bioelectronics.


124
00:16:57.446 --> 00:16:59.316
I don't think they
power those down.


125
00:16:59.696 --> 00:17:02.346
Because one night i fell
asleep with my implant on.


126
00:17:02.516 --> 00:17:03.746
And they didn't power down.

127
00:17:04.076 --> 00:17:07.436
That's a huge deal because my
implants have power supply that stays on.


128
00:17:07.763 --> 00:17:10.946
With that power supply i started
thinking i can reorganize the components.


129
00:17:11.336 --> 00:17:13.056
Squeeze a micro camera.

130
00:17:17.937 --> 00:17:19.056
See that.

131
00:17:19.916 --> 00:17:21.576
Is my nighttime in.

132
00:17:22.856 --> 00:17:24.606
One with the camera in.

133
00:17:30.866 --> 00:17:32.586
Still don't know what's there.

134
00:17:45.506 --> 00:17:47.136
When they have you.

135
00:17:48.056 --> 00:17:49.476
You can't move.

136
00:17:50.996 --> 00:17:52.416
You can't speak.

137
00:17:53.426 --> 00:17:56.016
You can't do anything
they don't want you to do.


138
00:17:56.336 --> 00:18:01.056
And if you're lucky you
won't remember any of it.


139
00:20:47.602 --> 00:20:49.682
When i look up
at the sky at night.


140
00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:53.132
I see more than just the stars.

141
00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:55.052
Planets.

142
00:20:58.372 --> 00:21:00.542
Sea a giant open door.

143
00:21:01.612 --> 00:21:03.262
Huge open window.

144
00:21:03.622 --> 00:21:06.002
That can't be shut.

145
00:21:07.702 --> 00:21:09.182
Sky that i see.

146
00:21:10.762 --> 00:21:12.022
People obsess over

147
00:21:12.322 --> 00:21:15.892
locking their doors and
locking their windows


148
00:21:15.892 --> 00:21:16.892
every night before
they go to bed right.


149
00:21:17.092 --> 00:21:18.572
That's all we do.

150
00:21:19.162 --> 00:21:20.432
But our sky.

151
00:21:22.433 --> 00:21:24.062
We can't close that.

152
00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:26.857
Reason these satellites in

153
00:21:26.963 --> 00:21:30.212
space with these messages
on NASA's golden records.


154
00:21:30.357 --> 00:21:32.732
Spit in fifty five
different languages.


155
00:21:32.962 --> 00:21:33.982
Broadcasting the

156
00:21:34.282 --> 00:21:36.452
things we'd never even met.

157
00:21:36.862 --> 00:21:41.042
Over and over and over again
deeper and deeper into space.


158
00:21:42.322 --> 00:21:44.012
We are from earth.

159
00:21:44.422 --> 00:21:46.742
We are exactly right here.

160
00:21:47.392 --> 00:21:48.962
Whoever you are.

161
00:21:49.012 --> 00:21:50.612
Please come to us.

162
00:21:51.053 --> 00:21:52.862
Come and see what we have.

163
00:21:53.392 --> 00:21:55.472
We have plenty for all.

164
00:21:56.632 --> 00:21:58.042
If you arrive late in the night

165
00:21:58.162 --> 00:21:59.612
when everyone's asleep.

166
00:22:00.292 --> 00:22:03.052
The sky is wide open

167
00:22:03.262 --> 00:22:05.342
skies always wide open.

168
00:22:07.462 --> 00:22:08.732
Rear the children.

169
00:22:10.552 --> 00:22:12.212
It's a pleasure to receive.

170
00:24:16.672 --> 00:24:18.032
When i was a kid.

171
00:24:19.103 --> 00:24:21.182
I heard these voices in my head.

172
00:24:23.212 --> 00:24:25.532
I was visited by
these light beams.


173
00:24:27.862 --> 00:24:29.252
Thought they were angels.

174
00:24:30.592 --> 00:24:33.122
I thought all kids were.

175
00:24:40.222 --> 00:24:41.642
Just cause problems.

176
00:24:43.732 --> 00:24:46.442
Apparently other kids were
being visited by these ancients.


177
00:24:47.547 --> 00:24:48.752
Just me.

178
00:24:50.752 --> 00:24:55.292
I was brought up in the
system through child services.


179
00:24:56.542 --> 00:24:59.162
Labeled me as sort of being
fucked right from the start.


180
00:25:01.492 --> 00:25:03.331
Messed up face and all that.

181
00:25:03.935 --> 00:25:06.002
Most people thought i was
just some schizophrenia.


182
00:25:16.222 --> 00:25:19.322
Doctors put me with all
that skits white med shit.


183
00:25:21.112 --> 00:25:23.139
Most families didn't want me.

184
00:25:23.392 --> 00:25:24.802
Except for the crazy ones

185
00:25:25.072 --> 00:25:26.762
which made it even worse.

186
00:25:27.472 --> 00:25:30.562
And so i was brought up.

187
00:25:31.132 --> 00:25:31.822
To be this little

188
00:25:31.942 --> 00:25:33.962
psycho right from the start.

189
00:25:37.492 --> 00:25:39.092
Turns out i had a grandmother.

190
00:25:40.462 --> 00:25:42.082
She found me
when i was like six or.


191
00:25:42.592 --> 00:25:44.012
Seven maybe.

192
00:25:46.462 --> 00:25:48.992
She came in and
snatched me ride out.


193
00:25:50.001 --> 00:25:51.392
Blink of an eye.

194
00:25:51.712 --> 00:25:52.832
I'll change.

195
00:25:54.772 --> 00:25:56.612
She got my hearing right.

196
00:25:56.842 --> 00:25:58.742
She got me speaking right.

197
00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:01.952
Got me out of that system.

198
00:26:02.512 --> 00:26:06.152
And we began this sort of.

199
00:26:06.202 --> 00:26:07.802
Run around the country.

200
00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:12.332
Town to town to town.

201
00:26:13.012 --> 00:26:14.392
City to city to city.

202
00:26:14.932 --> 00:26:16.102
I was always the new kid.

203
00:26:16.522 --> 00:26:20.072
Always the deaf kid kid
with the face problem kid.


204
00:26:20.512 --> 00:26:21.721
We were always.

205
00:26:35.122 --> 00:26:36.212
My grandma.

206
00:26:38.152 --> 00:26:39.362
She was.

207
00:26:39.952 --> 00:26:41.282
She was tough.

208
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:43.742
She was sort of a century.

209
00:26:47.392 --> 00:26:48.841
She was a good person.

210
00:26:53.482 --> 00:26:55.981
She passed away not
too long ago though.


211
00:26:58.642 --> 00:27:00.302
Now that is just me.

212
00:27:00.832 --> 00:27:05.792
I guess that's why i'm making.

213
00:27:41.152 --> 00:27:45.892
I got footage of this one.

214
00:27:46.252 --> 00:27:46.792
Mix.

215
00:27:47.122 --> 00:27:47.932
She's female

216
00:27:48.142 --> 00:27:49.042
half us

217
00:27:49.222 --> 00:27:49.942
half then

218
00:27:50.183 --> 00:27:51.382
she's more like ox

219
00:27:51.622 --> 00:27:52.132
human.

220
00:27:52.582 --> 00:27:55.074
I feel like I've seen
her my whole life.


221
00:27:55.552 --> 00:27:56.782
She has this name

222
00:27:57.022 --> 00:27:58.192
but it's not a name

223
00:27:58.342 --> 00:28:00.062
they don't use names.

224
00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:01.582
Use.

225
00:28:02.212 --> 00:28:05.302
Abstract thoughts or
descriptions as names


226
00:28:05.482 --> 00:28:06.482
hers.

227
00:28:07.012 --> 00:28:07.792
Is something like

228
00:28:08.002 --> 00:28:10.222
the beginning of night or.

229
00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.472
The night begins to form.

230
00:28:13.042 --> 00:28:14.062
She's trapped.

231
00:28:14.452 --> 00:28:14.662
Like.

232
00:28:15.142 --> 00:28:15.472
Me.

233
00:28:16.012 --> 00:28:16.852
I'm down here.

234
00:28:17.272 --> 00:28:17.842
She's.

235
00:28:18.232 --> 00:28:18.742
Up there.

236
00:28:19.102 --> 00:28:19.312
Or

237
00:28:19.582 --> 00:28:20.452
wherever they are

238
00:28:20.632 --> 00:28:21.232
with them

239
00:28:21.472 --> 00:28:23.002
we're both a part of.

240
00:28:23.812 --> 00:28:25.012
Whatever it is they're doing.

241
00:28:25.462 --> 00:28:26.962
I don't even know
what that is when.


242
00:28:27.562 --> 00:28:28.312
She does

243
00:28:28.492 --> 00:28:29.422
she can't tell me.

244
00:28:29.782 --> 00:28:31.172
She wants.

245
00:29:36.592 --> 00:29:41.722
[mysterious sounds continuous.]

246
00:30:33.984 --> 00:30:34.984
[Ignition sounds.].

247
00:30:48.384 --> 00:30:49.894
Everything i do.

248
00:30:50.814 --> 00:30:52.354
Everything i think.

249
00:30:53.154 --> 00:30:54.904
Everything I've ever known.

250
00:30:56.156 --> 00:30:58.114
They were all over me.

251
00:30:58.284 --> 00:31:01.228
So i started thinking about
survivor mode in the video.


252
00:31:01.284 --> 00:31:02.284
Driver.

253
00:31:02.814 --> 00:31:04.294
Concert chasing.

254
00:31:04.854 --> 00:31:06.544
Slamming into walls.

255
00:31:06.894 --> 00:31:08.734
Cars are flying everywhere.

256
00:31:08.784 --> 00:31:09.324
Crash

257
00:31:09.504 --> 00:31:10.504
smash.

258
00:31:10.674 --> 00:31:11.674
Speedy.

259
00:31:11.934 --> 00:31:13.894
Screaming as loud as.

260
00:31:16.254 --> 00:31:16.614
Weird.

261
00:31:17.124 --> 00:31:18.624
But i could tell i was
freaking them out.


262
00:31:19.014 --> 00:31:21.234
They just stopped moving
and locked onto my thoughts


263
00:31:21.504 --> 00:31:22.450
actually reached out

264
00:31:22.554 --> 00:31:23.004
push smart.

265
00:31:23.334 --> 00:31:24.024
Not hard.

266
00:31:24.564 --> 00:31:26.017
It took them by surprise.

267
00:31:26.154 --> 00:31:27.574
When they're in my mind.

268
00:31:27.654 --> 00:31:29.304
I don't let them know
about my hidden camera.


269
00:31:29.814 --> 00:31:31.434
I don't let them know
about my hidden camera


270
00:31:31.734 --> 00:31:33.354
i don't let them know
about my hidden camera.


271
00:31:33.684 --> 00:31:35.274
I don't let them know
about my hidden camera


272
00:31:35.454 --> 00:31:36.204
i block it out

273
00:31:36.384 --> 00:31:39.064
i think about drivers
of crazy thoughts.


274
00:31:39.804 --> 00:31:41.164
Strong emotions.

275
00:32:20.334 --> 00:32:21.804
There's this lady on this table.

276
00:32:22.224 --> 00:32:26.254
Hmm she was
laying right next to me.


277
00:32:33.945 --> 00:32:35.794
Chest cut wide open.

278
00:32:36.384 --> 00:32:38.344
They were doing some sort of.

279
00:32:38.424 --> 00:32:40.235
Experiment on her.

280
00:32:45.415 --> 00:32:46.834
Thought she was dead.

281
00:32:47.574 --> 00:32:49.264
She was just laying there.

282
00:32:50.034 --> 00:32:50.844
Look straight up

283
00:32:51.084 --> 00:32:52.624
eyes wide open.

284
00:32:53.184 --> 00:33:03.184
And then she turned
and started talking to me.


285
00:34:46.704 --> 00:34:55.434
And.

286
00:34:57.024 --> 00:34:59.134
They remind me
of a swarm of bees.


287
00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:00.534
When they stare at you.

288
00:35:01.254 --> 00:35:02.674
There's no eyeball.

289
00:35:03.204 --> 00:35:04.594
It's just black.

290
00:35:05.184 --> 00:35:06.534
They talk to you
with those things


291
00:35:06.744 --> 00:35:09.244
sometimes it's all i
see is those eyes.


292
00:35:09.444 --> 00:35:11.344
Those big black eyes.

293
00:35:11.914 --> 00:35:13.464
It doesn't matter which
was talking to you.


294
00:35:14.274 --> 00:35:16.084
It's all in the same voice.

295
00:35:16.494 --> 00:35:17.304
My voice.

296
00:35:17.694 --> 00:35:20.104
My own voice
telling me what to do.


297
00:35:23.034 --> 00:35:25.534
Share of master brain
of thought process.


298
00:35:26.304 --> 00:35:27.204
What one of them knows.

299
00:35:27.624 --> 00:35:28.224
They all know.

300
00:35:28.614 --> 00:35:29.964
What one of them thinks.

301
00:35:30.354 --> 00:35:31.714
They all think.

302
00:35:33.746 --> 00:35:34.974
You believe everything they say

303
00:35:35.274 --> 00:35:37.054
because it's your voice saying.

304
00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:37.884
You can't help it

305
00:35:38.034 --> 00:35:39.294
because it's like a god voice.

306
00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:41.424
That speaks to
every bit of your being


307
00:35:41.844 --> 00:35:44.194
to every sense
into every belief.


308
00:35:45.174 --> 00:35:46.744
Do whatever they say.

309
00:35:47.754 --> 00:35:48.774
They try to soothe me.

310
00:35:49.524 --> 00:35:51.754
But they have no
clue how to do it.


311
00:35:52.027 --> 00:35:54.214
Sort of emotionless or robotic.

312
00:35:55.824 --> 00:35:57.324
They say that they're helping us

313
00:35:57.564 --> 00:35:58.404
making us better.

314
00:35:58.764 --> 00:36:00.904
Making us biologically better.

315
00:36:00.984 --> 00:36:02.034
Hear them think that.

316
00:36:02.754 --> 00:36:04.354
They own us or something.

317
00:36:05.034 --> 00:36:07.144
They share these
unusual thoughts.


318
00:36:07.254 --> 00:36:08.524
We're all.

319
00:36:08.814 --> 00:36:10.554
We all come from the same place.

320
00:36:11.004 --> 00:36:12.534
We're helping
you don't be afraid.


321
00:36:12.924 --> 00:36:14.406
Or making you better.

322
00:36:14.664 --> 00:36:15.474
Better have.

323
00:36:15.924 --> 00:36:17.974
Better like what like them.

324
00:36:18.024 --> 00:36:19.074
Stop taking me.

325
00:36:19.614 --> 00:36:20.814
Because you terrify me.

326
00:36:21.384 --> 00:36:24.514
You take me when you want and you
make me do things i don't remember.


327
00:36:29.184 --> 00:36:31.354
I got these four cameras now.

328
00:36:31.404 --> 00:36:33.184
I got my hat cam.

329
00:36:33.744 --> 00:36:35.524
I got my chess camp.

330
00:36:35.904 --> 00:36:39.454
That the white cam.

331
00:36:39.984 --> 00:36:41.554
I got.

332
00:36:41.874 --> 00:36:43.023
That head.

333
00:36:43.344 --> 00:36:45.204
Hey.

334
00:36:47.184 --> 00:36:48.144
And they are all powered up

335
00:36:48.384 --> 00:36:50.074
and they're all ready to go.

336
00:37:42.834 --> 00:37:45.064
Whoever you are
whatever you are.


337
00:37:45.414 --> 00:37:46.804
Or see your cars.

338
00:37:48.564 --> 00:37:50.344
Fuel you when you're around.

339
00:37:51.024 --> 00:37:53.134
I used to pretend not to.

340
00:37:53.754 --> 00:37:55.114
But i don't pretend anymore.

341
00:37:56.992 --> 00:37:58.174
