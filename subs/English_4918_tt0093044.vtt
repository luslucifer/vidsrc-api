1
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:43.800
I'm Kim Philby, Major.

2
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.405
That is, Colonel Philby
KGB, retired...


3
00:03:51.948 --> 00:03:55.782
I think you will find I have
an appointment with General Govorshin


4
00:03:55.985 --> 00:04:02.288
The Chairman of the KGB General
Govorshin left three hours ago.


5
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:04.149
But that's impossible.

6
00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:07.223
I was summoned for
an important conference with him.


7
00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:08.588
I regret,

8
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:11.857
the Comrade General charged me
to make an alternative arrangement.


9
00:04:13.803 --> 00:04:15.737
And what, pray, might that be?

10
00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:50.624
Major Valeri Alexeivitch Petrofsky?

11
00:06:04.313 --> 00:06:05.575
At ease.

12
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.080
You're a fortunate man, 
Major Petrofsky

13
00:06:15.558 --> 00:06:18.994
You have been chosen for a mission
of the utmost importance.


14
00:06:19.595 --> 00:06:22.029
If you are successful you will return
to honours


15
00:06:22.264 --> 00:06:24.926
and promotions beyond your dreams.

16
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.601
As Chairman of the KGB,
I am giving you a director order.


17
00:06:32.508 --> 00:06:36.342
You will accept my authority,
and my authority alone.


18
00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:39.574
You will consult neither your
Camp Kommandant


19
00:06:39.915 --> 00:06:42.509
nor the head of
the Illegals Directorate.


20
00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:47.152
Nor will you reveal details
of this mission to anyone.


21
00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:52.060
Major Pavlov her will be in charge
of your briefing


22
00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:55.287
if you have any questions,
you will direct them to him.


23
00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:05.539
They tell me you are the star
of the Illegals Directorate.


24
00:07:10.546 --> 00:07:12.377
You will need to be.

25
00:07:13.682 --> 00:07:16.845
Thank you, London! It's fifteen minutes
to midnight and here


26
00:07:17.052 --> 00:07:20.579
in Trafalgar Square huge crowds
are already gathering to welcome


27
00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:23.724
in the New Year everyone's
in good spirits.


28
00:07:23.993 --> 00:07:26.985
The crowd is cheerful but orderly
and the police so far,


29
00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:28.424
have had an easy time.

30
00:07:28.764 --> 00:07:33.827
St John's Ambulance have only had
to deal with a few people fainting up


31
00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:36.196
in the studio in Glasgow
our Hogmanay party is in full swing


32
00:07:36.438 --> 00:07:39.839
so... let's go north of the border
to join in the fun


33
00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:43.138
Nigel!

34
00:07:43.345 --> 00:07:44.403
I've some reinforcements...

35
00:07:44.613 --> 00:07:46.080
Drunkard sod!

36
00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:47.144
It's Jeremy!

37
00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:49.249
Tell Nigel to open the bloody door!

38
00:07:53.122 --> 00:07:55.556
James... Happy New Year.

39
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:56.758
What flat do you want, sir?

40
00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:58.790
I've got the reinforcements for Nigel!

41
00:07:58.994 --> 00:08:00.859
Yes. But what flat number, sir?

42
00:08:01.363 --> 00:08:02.455
Don't worry

43
00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:04.522
I'll follow the noise.

44
00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:00.896
Happy New Year.

45
00:12:56.425 --> 00:12:58.450
Bingo...

46
00:13:01.497 --> 00:13:02.589
Ah! Preston.

47
00:13:04.833 --> 00:13:05.959
Come and sit down.

48
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:17.901
Preston, I have told the Committee
that I did not authorise


49
00:13:18.113 --> 00:13:19.512
your action last night.

50
00:13:19.715 --> 00:13:22.912
I have also told them
you have needlessly alerted Berenson


51
00:13:23.118 --> 00:13:25.678
to our investigations by
recklessly blowing up his safe!


52
00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:29.085
Presumably you have some explanation
for the decision, Preston?


53
00:13:29.658 --> 00:13:30.784
Well, we've got Berenson.

54
00:13:30.993 --> 00:13:32.824
What we need now is the name
of his controller.


55
00:13:33.228 --> 00:13:35.822
If Berenson believes
it was only a burglary


56
00:13:36.031 --> 00:13:37.658
he won't be afraid to contact him.

57
00:13:41.303 --> 00:13:44.363
But that still doesn't explain why
you didn't ask for my authorisation.


58
00:13:44.773 --> 00:13:46.001
You wouldn't have given it.

59
00:13:46.875 --> 00:13:48.206
That will be all, Preston.

60
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.275
Berenson's away, I take it?

61
00:13:50.846 --> 00:13:53.474
He's at a house party in Yorkshire.
With his wife.


62
00:13:54.049 --> 00:13:56.779
Yes, but, er, tomorrow is Saturday,
Sir Anthony


63
00:13:56.985 --> 00:13:59.818
we don't expect him back until Monday
we will pick him up then.


64
00:14:00.455 --> 00:14:02.855
But do you go along with that, Preston?

65
00:14:05.827 --> 00:14:07.522
He has a girlfriend.

66
00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:10.755
I'm sorry what's that
got to do with it

67
00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:12.158
Quite.

68
00:14:13.368 --> 00:14:16.030
I wouldn't be surprised if he found
an excuse to leave the wife


69
00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:20.469
in Yorkshire come back early,
and start the New Year with a bang.


70
00:14:23.412 --> 00:14:24.845
I see.

71
00:14:25.814 --> 00:14:27.406
What do you want, Preston?

72
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.542
Round the clock surveillance.

73
00:14:29.751 --> 00:14:30.581
Three teams of watchers.

74
00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:32.253
Phone tap. Mail intercept.

75
00:14:32.454 --> 00:14:33.546
Everything, immediately.

76
00:14:33.822 --> 00:14:36.689
Twenty four men round the clock
for an indefinite period!?


77
00:14:37.492 --> 00:14:40.086
That would mean wrecking at least three
of our current operations.


78
00:14:40.462 --> 00:14:42.555
Brian, I'm sure you'll agree that
this Berenson business


79
00:14:42.764 --> 00:14:44.356
is of overriding importance.

80
00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.227
Yes, of course, Sir Anthony.

81
00:14:47.703 --> 00:14:48.863
Alright, Preston, you've got it.

82
00:14:49.838 --> 00:14:51.863
Gentlemen,
I suggest we reconvene after lunch.


83
00:15:07.222 --> 00:15:08.189
Preston.

84
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.254
Got a moment?

85
00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:10.322
Close the door.

86
00:15:20.068 --> 00:15:23.526
Just what the hell do you think
you are playing at!!!


87
00:15:24.039 --> 00:15:27.600
First, you have the unmitigated qall
to proceed without my permission.


88
00:15:27.809 --> 00:15:30.710
Then you deliberately try to embarrass
the service in front of that shit,


89
00:15:30.912 --> 00:15:32.038
Irvine!

90
00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:32.871
Of course,

91
00:15:33.081 --> 00:15:34.070
I'm well aware that
you somehow consider yourself


92
00:15:34.282 --> 00:15:36.910
as outside the normal chain
of command but let me remind you that


93
00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:40.145
this is a SERVICE not a free-for-all!

94
00:15:40.355 --> 00:15:41.481
And when you've finished showing off,

95
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.750
you come back to work for me
and I as Director General


96
00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.154
of the Security Service...

97
00:15:46.361 --> 00:15:48.022
Acting Director General...

98
00:15:48.296 --> 00:15:50.059
Bernard Hemmings isn't dead yet.

99
00:15:50.966 --> 00:15:53.935
Look, Preston let's get this straight.

100
00:15:54.169 --> 00:15:55.431
If, or rather when,

101
00:15:55.637 --> 00:15:58.435
I am confirmed as head
of this department you are just going


102
00:15:58.573 --> 00:16:00.006
to disappear.

103
00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:01.072
Without trace.

104
00:16:01.276 --> 00:16:02.800
I will bear that in mind.

105
00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:06.740
In the meantime, 
I want another report

106
00:16:06.948 --> 00:16:10.907
Complete in every detail, on my desk
before you go home.


107
00:16:11.353 --> 00:16:13.719
Would that include this meeting, Sir?

108
00:16:14.656 --> 00:16:16.283
Do it!!!

109
00:16:19.494 --> 00:16:20.324
Yes, Sir.

110
00:16:50.692 --> 00:16:52.592
General Govorshin asked me
to give you this.


111
00:16:53.028 --> 00:16:54.393
Your final instructions.

112
00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:57.755
Okay. Could you put these
in the car for me?


113
00:16:59.801 --> 00:17:00.699
Thank you.

114
00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:11.537
Nigel.

115
00:18:15.243 --> 00:18:17.177
Bernard how are you?

116
00:18:18.246 --> 00:18:19.508
Terrible.

117
00:18:20.649 --> 00:18:23.550
But I'd rather you didn't mention
it to Harcourt Smith.


118
00:18:24.553 --> 00:18:27.681
Or has that little shit already
got me dead and buried?


119
00:18:27.923 --> 00:18:28.685
Not quite.

120
00:18:28.924 --> 00:18:31.154
But he does seem pretty confident
that he will be your successor.


121
00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.152
Has he got rid of all my people?

122
00:18:33.662 --> 00:18:36.392
No there are still a few flies
in his ointment.


123
00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:38.826
John Preston, in particular.

124
00:18:39.134 --> 00:18:40.066
Good man, John.

125
00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:42.200
What's he been up
to?


126
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:44.404
Well, that's what I wanted to talk
to you about.


127
00:18:45.273 --> 00:18:48.709
Perston's caught
that prick Berenson leaking NATO papers


128
00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.209
And I'd appreciate a little chat
about what we might do with him.


129
00:19:10.498 --> 00:19:11.294
Julia?

130
00:19:11.533 --> 00:19:12.500
George.

131
00:19:12.801 --> 00:19:13.699
How was the New Year?

132
00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:14.800
How was yours?

133
00:19:15.003 --> 00:19:15.935
So, so.

134
00:19:17.305 --> 00:19:18.135
How about tonight, then?

135
00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.307
Yes, lovely.

136
00:19:19.674 --> 00:19:20.140
Seven?

137
00:19:20.342 --> 00:19:21.172
Okay.

138
00:19:21.476 --> 00:19:22.374
Fine.

139
00:19:23.111 --> 00:19:23.634
See you then.

140
00:19:23.845 --> 00:19:24.641
'Bye.

141
00:19:25.146 --> 00:19:26.010
'Bye.

142
00:19:49.704 --> 00:19:51.103
Oh my God!

143
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.940
Hello?

144
00:19:56.478 --> 00:19:59.140
Julia. I'm sorry, darling,

145
00:19:59.347 --> 00:20:01.577
something's come up
I'm afraid I'll have to skip tonight.


146
00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:02.807
Why? Is it Angela?

147
00:20:03.018 --> 00:20:04.508
No. It's the bloody office.

148
00:20:05.086 --> 00:20:06.485
Oh, Geroge, I'm sorry about that.

149
00:20:06.688 --> 00:20:07.416
So am I.

150
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:09.814
I'll, er, call you tomorrow. Alright?

151
00:20:10.425 --> 00:20:10.982
Bye.

152
00:20:11.192 --> 00:20:11.817
Bye.

153
00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.621
Chummy's gone to ground.

154
00:22:57.092 --> 00:22:59.060
Pizzeria on Fillimore Walk.

155
00:22:59.394 --> 00:23:01.021
It's a long way
to go for a pizza.

156
00:23:01.396 --> 00:23:02.624
I think we'll join him.

157
00:23:09.537 --> 00:23:11.869
Do you think Jimmy's overdoing
it a little?


158
00:23:12.407 --> 00:23:14.272
Gloria doesn't seem to be objecting.

159
00:23:18.546 --> 00:23:19.877
Well done, Charlie.

160
00:23:21.082 --> 00:23:22.276
Alright.
Here we go.


161
00:23:28.923 --> 00:23:31.414
Don't you like your pizza, Mr Berenson?

162
00:23:34.095 --> 00:23:36.120
No we don't go...

163
00:23:36.664 --> 00:23:37.722
It's a drop.

164
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.894
So what do we do about Berenson?

165
00:23:40.135 --> 00:23:41.466
Better give him the first team.

166
00:23:46.941 --> 00:23:48.203
Oh, shit!

167
00:23:48.443 --> 00:23:48.966
What?

168
00:23:49.177 --> 00:23:50.769
Take away pizzas in boxes!

169
00:23:51.846 --> 00:23:52.710
William...

170
00:23:52.914 --> 00:23:54.074
The girl with the pizzas.

171
00:24:00.221 --> 00:24:01.449
The Manager again.

172
00:24:03.258 --> 00:24:05.283
Who gets special service?

173
00:24:06.127 --> 00:24:07.355
He does.

174
00:24:07.562 --> 00:24:08.620
We'll take this one.

175
00:24:56.477 --> 00:24:57.739
Hello, Angela.

176
00:24:58.713 --> 00:24:59.839
Nigel Irvine.

177
00:25:00.315 --> 00:25:03.045
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, of course.
How silly of me.


178
00:25:03.418 --> 00:25:04.680
Were we expecting you?

179
00:25:05.086 --> 00:25:06.451
Not exactly.

180
00:25:06.854 --> 00:25:07.946
Do you mind if we come in?

181
00:25:09.023 --> 00:25:10.854
No. Please do.

182
00:25:18.533 --> 00:25:19.500
Is George in?

183
00:25:19.734 --> 00:25:20.257
Yes, of course.

184
00:25:20.501 --> 00:25:21.559
Darling!

185
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.197
In North Wales, severe blizzards...

186
00:25:25.873 --> 00:25:26.965
Hello, George.

187
00:25:27.709 --> 00:25:28.767
Nigel.

188
00:25:29.143 --> 00:25:30.610
How nice.

189
00:25:30.912 --> 00:25:32.846
I wonder if we
might have a quiet word?

190
00:25:36.150 --> 00:25:37.276
Yes, of course.

191
00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.512
Do sit down.

192
00:25:51.532 --> 00:25:52.863
Quiet New Year's holiday?

193
00:25:54.969 --> 00:25:56.493
Not missing something, are you?

194
00:25:58.506 --> 00:25:59.973
What do you want, Nigel?

195
00:26:00.608 --> 00:26:02.200
I thought you might
be missing something.


196
00:26:03.544 --> 00:26:04.875
Like this.

197
00:26:07.348 --> 00:26:08.838
These are yours, I believe.

198
00:26:10.752 --> 00:26:13.118
But these beyond a doubt...

199
00:26:14.422 --> 00:26:15.912
Never were.

200
00:26:20.395 --> 00:26:22.363
I don't suppose there's much I can say,
is there?


201
00:26:22.697 --> 00:26:23.959
I don't know.

202
00:26:25.199 --> 00:26:26.666
Try me.

203
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.637
Alright.

204
00:26:31.572 --> 00:26:36.236
Well for years now I have taken
the attitude that there


205
00:26:36.444 --> 00:26:38.844
was only one struggle
on this planet worth a damn


206
00:26:39.781 --> 00:26:42.215
the fight against world communism.

207
00:26:43.918 --> 00:26:48.048
And it has long seemed to me ridiculous
that the most committed anti communists


208
00:26:48.256 --> 00:26:52.556
in the southern hemisphere
the South Africans should be excluded


209
00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:53.624
from NATO planning because

210
00:26:53.828 --> 00:26:55.955
of some unfashionable

211
00:26:56.164 --> 00:26:57.756
domestic attitudes.

212
00:26:58.499 --> 00:26:59.966
So was this your idea?

213
00:27:00.501 --> 00:27:01.968
Or did someone approach you?

214
00:27:03.738 --> 00:27:05.569
I met someone at a party.

215
00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:07.868
Or did he meet you?

216
00:27:10.311 --> 00:27:11.835
Jan Marais...

217
00:27:13.448 --> 00:27:16.144
It seems our Secret Service
is up to scratch.


218
00:27:20.588 --> 00:27:23.386
Just what exactly
have you been passing him?


219
00:27:24.859 --> 00:27:26.656
It would be awfully helpful to know.

220
00:27:27.729 --> 00:27:33.031
I gave him any relevant documents
to NATO taht crossed my desk.


221
00:27:33.901 --> 00:27:35.095
NATO?

222
00:27:36.204 --> 00:27:37.603
Mmm-huh.

223
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:40.571
Well,
I hope they didn't pay you in cash,


224
00:27:40.775 --> 00:27:43.209
Berenson the Rand's taken a bit
of a dive lately.


225
00:27:43.444 --> 00:27:44.877
I didn't do it for money.

226
00:27:45.179 --> 00:27:46.771
I did it because I believed
it was right!


227
00:27:47.048 --> 00:27:48.948
A man of principle to the last.

228
00:27:49.183 --> 00:27:50.741
You can bloody well sneer,

229
00:27:50.952 --> 00:27:52.977
Irvine but perhaps I'm rather more
of a patriot than you are.


230
00:27:54.322 --> 00:27:55.721
You may be interested in this.

231
00:27:56.457 --> 00:27:59.949
It's an extract from the debriefing
of a recent Soviet defector


232
00:28:00.395 --> 00:28:04.832
which pinpoints a Soviet agent
in the South African Foreign Service.


233
00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.368
And this is a summation of the South
African internal investigation


234
00:28:10.004 --> 00:28:14.134
which identifies the man
as one Jan Marais.


235
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.341
What have I done?

236
00:28:22.049 --> 00:28:23.812
You've betrayed your country.

237
00:28:24.252 --> 00:28:26.652
You've passed untold numbers
of secrets to Moscow...


238
00:28:27.488 --> 00:28:31.822
And endangered the lives of British men
and women and I'd say,


239
00:28:32.026 --> 00:28:35.826
you've weakened NATO
perhaps irretrievably.


240
00:28:37.765 --> 00:28:38.959
Oh my God!

241
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.567
Just your
and your schoolboy politics...


242
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:46.938
And your idiotically conceited faith
in your own importance.


243
00:28:50.978 --> 00:28:57.713
Now some of our more muscular
colleagues favour taking you to a cell


244
00:28:57.919 --> 00:29:01.878
and going to work on you with
a carving knife and a pair of pliers.


245
00:29:03.391 --> 00:29:07.623
The rest would like to feed you
to the newspapers and throw what's left


246
00:29:07.829 --> 00:29:09.524
into prison for 20 years.

247
00:29:11.866 --> 00:29:13.800
It's a tricky choice, isn't it?

248
00:29:15.303 --> 00:29:18.739
However this is what you will do.

249
00:29:19.707 --> 00:29:22.835
You will resume
your "special relationship" with Moscow


250
00:29:23.811 --> 00:29:31.115
Only this time I shall be suplying
the papers. Understand?


251
00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:41.022
Then later when we're finished
we can decide what to do with you.


252
00:29:43.431 --> 00:29:45.160
I'm very grateful, Nigel.

253
00:29:50.771 --> 00:29:52.636
Good operation. Damn good.

254
00:29:53.174 --> 00:29:54.539
The turning of Berenson?

255
00:29:54.775 --> 00:29:57.938
No. The false flag recruitment,
the way he was run.


256
00:29:58.846 --> 00:30:00.040
Very clever.

257
00:30:01.816 --> 00:30:04.842
I've been thinking it reminds me
of someone...


258
00:30:05.453 --> 00:30:06.385
Who?

259
00:30:11.058 --> 00:30:16.052
General Yevgeni Sergeivitch Karpov,
Deputy Head KGB...


260
00:30:17.498 --> 00:30:19.398
Sort of your opposite number, then?

261
00:30:20.101 --> 00:30:21.363
You could say that, yes.

262
00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:26.504
I shall enjoy feeding him
a few wrong turns for a change.


263
00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:40.178
The well-known Kremlin watcher
we also have


264
00:30:40.388 --> 00:30:45.087
with us Colonal K who quit Moscow
to come to the West last year Colonel,


265
00:30:45.293 --> 00:30:47.887
who's now the leader
of the minority hard line group


266
00:30:48.095 --> 00:30:49.221
in the Politburo?

267
00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:53.591
Certainly it would be a KGB chief,
Govorshin.


268
00:30:54.302 --> 00:30:56.793
How secure would you say he is?

269
00:30:57.038 --> 00:31:01.168
You know, Govorshin is in
a very delicate situation unless comes


270
00:31:01.375 --> 00:31:06.244
some change in world power balance
to justify his his hard line policies.


271
00:31:06.447 --> 00:31:07.812
You talk about a hard line, I...

272
00:31:12.753 --> 00:31:14.812
KGB Chief, Govorshin.

273
00:31:15.022 --> 00:31:17.047
How secure would you say he is?

274
00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:18.223
Govorshin is in

275
00:31:18.426 --> 00:31:23.625
a delicate situation unless comes
some change in world power balance...


276
00:31:35.977 --> 00:31:36.966
General Karpov?

277
00:31:37.211 --> 00:31:38.803
General Borisov on line one.

278
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:45.313
General Borisov.

279
00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:46.611
General Karpov.

280
00:31:48.356 --> 00:31:49.755
Pavel Petrovich, how are you?

281
00:31:49.957 --> 00:31:52.118
Fine. I need to talk to you.

282
00:31:53.027 --> 00:31:53.925
Yes?

283
00:31:54.128 --> 00:31:55.789
It's serious. Can we meet today?

284
00:31:56.731 --> 00:31:57.755
Well, where are you?

285
00:31:57.999 --> 00:32:00.160
I'm out of town. I'm fishing.

286
00:32:00.968 --> 00:32:02.526
All right,
I'll drive out this afternoon.


287
00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:04.169
Good. Good.

288
00:32:08.142 --> 00:32:11.305
Natasha, I won't be back after lunch.

289
00:32:11.512 --> 00:32:12.536
I'll call your driver.

290
00:32:12.747 --> 00:32:14.977
No. I'll drive myself.

291
00:32:48.883 --> 00:32:50.043
Karpov my friend.

292
00:32:50.751 --> 00:32:51.547
That was quick.

293
00:32:51.952 --> 00:32:52.850
How are you?

294
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.246
I'm good. I'm good.

295
00:32:58.726 --> 00:33:00.125
Bistovia.

296
00:33:03.164 --> 00:33:07.567
Yevgeni Sergeivitch how long have
we known each other?


297
00:33:08.002 --> 00:33:09.799
Get to the point Pavel Petrovitch.

298
00:33:12.873 --> 00:33:15.933
Why are you stripping my department?

299
00:33:17.778 --> 00:33:19.006
Why am I what?!

300
00:33:19.213 --> 00:33:21.113
Stripping me clean.

301
00:33:21.782 --> 00:33:23.613
Everyday something new is taken from me

302
00:33:24.652 --> 00:33:27.120
First, the very best agent
we have specialising


303
00:33:27.321 --> 00:33:30.347
in Britain Major Valeri Petrofsky.

304
00:33:31.158 --> 00:33:37.097
And then, a forged life story
meticulously maintained over the years


305
00:33:37.431 --> 00:33:40.229
a legend that fits Valeri Petrofsky
like a glove.


306
00:33:42.636 --> 00:33:44.103
Where do you want me to stop?

307
00:33:44.405 --> 00:33:44.996
Couriers,

308
00:33:45.239 --> 00:33:49.539
their documentations radio men
and then the coding crystals


309
00:33:49.744 --> 00:33:52.679
for that sleeper transmitter
you yourself planted when you were head


310
00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.177
of the KGB in London.

311
00:33:55.916 --> 00:33:57.975
What the hell
are you mounting over there?


312
00:34:00.554 --> 00:34:04.991
Whose authority has been
on all these transfers?


313
00:34:08.395 --> 00:34:09.862
Govorshin!

314
00:34:13.267 --> 00:34:17.203
But Comrade, General Chairman Govorshin
knows nothing about Western Europe.


315
00:34:17.404 --> 00:34:20.339
That's why I was sure that
you knew of it.


316
00:34:22.576 --> 00:34:24.976
Pavel Petrovitch, old friend,
I give you my word.


317
00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:29.447
I'm not the one
who's wrecking your department.


318
00:34:29.683 --> 00:34:31.514
Then what the hell is going on?

319
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.420
Yevgeni Sergevitch, I'm sorry.
I thought that you...


320
00:34:35.623 --> 00:34:39.059
No. No. In your position
I would have thought the same.


321
00:34:41.729 --> 00:34:48.532
So, who is advising Govorshin
on England, apart from ourselves?


322
00:34:54.175 --> 00:34:56.200
Do you think he's trying
to embarrass you?


323
00:35:01.248 --> 00:35:03.045
Maybe remover you?

324
00:35:06.053 --> 00:35:07.850
Not as far as I know.

325
00:35:09.757 --> 00:35:16.424
No... He and I have not had any,
er fireside chats lately.


326
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.932
Something's wrong here, Yevgeni.

327
00:35:25.105 --> 00:35:26.402
Take care.

328
00:35:28.209 --> 00:35:29.471
Take care.

329
00:35:32.746 --> 00:35:33.940
I'll look into it.

330
00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.444
Stay well old friend.

331
00:35:40.788 --> 00:35:42.050
And stay silent.

332
00:35:44.692 --> 00:35:47.593
By the way, what's the name?

333
00:35:50.264 --> 00:35:51.561
What's the name of the legend?

334
00:35:51.832 --> 00:35:53.094
The name of the legend?

335
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.398
Ross.

336
00:35:55.169 --> 00:35:57.103
James Edward Ross.

337
00:36:09.216 --> 00:36:10.308
Mr Ross?

338
00:36:10.551 --> 00:36:11.518
Yes?

339
00:36:13.988 --> 00:36:17.719
I'm so sorry I'm late...
I'm Jill Dunkley.


340
00:36:17.925 --> 00:36:18.482
How do you do?

341
00:36:18.692 --> 00:36:20.887
It's absolute bloody mayhem out there!

342
00:36:21.395 --> 00:36:22.259
I'm sorry?

343
00:36:22.429 --> 00:36:24.522
The traffic. Quite frightening.

344
00:36:24.765 --> 00:36:26.096
I got stuck for half
an hour behind


345
00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:28.801
some motorised carrot pulper
or something.


346
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.498
Anyway, I gather you're looking for
a three month leg?


347
00:36:32.706 --> 00:36:34.901
Yes, that kind of thing.

348
00:36:35.843 --> 00:36:37.572
Are you a single man, Mr Ross?

349
00:36:37.811 --> 00:36:40.473
My wife will be joining me as soon
as we sell our house in Plymouth.


350
00:36:40.681 --> 00:36:41.807
Oh, well that's nice.

351
00:36:42.449 --> 00:36:44.212
This is the attic, upstairs.

352
00:36:44.418 --> 00:36:46.477
I see. Thank you.

353
00:36:46.687 --> 00:36:50.885
Then there's the bathroom
and this is the second bedroom.


354
00:37:21.188 --> 00:37:22.849
Of course one does hear
the occasional sound from


355
00:37:23.057 --> 00:37:24.718
the Baywaters American Airbase.

356
00:37:24.925 --> 00:37:26.187
But I hope it doesn't bother you.

357
00:37:28.862 --> 00:37:29.920
No.

358
00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:31.256
That doesn't bother me at all.

359
00:38:04.598 --> 00:38:05.565
Yes?

360
00:38:05.833 --> 00:38:06.731
General...

361
00:38:19.246 --> 00:38:21.737
Tell the first courier to proceed.

362
00:38:21.949 --> 00:38:22.973
Yes sir.

363
00:38:25.386 --> 00:38:28.878
Would passengers arriving
on swiss Air Flight 307,


364
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:31.250
please collect their luggage...

365
00:38:55.783 --> 00:38:56.647
Hey...

366
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:58.078
You must be our new neighbour.

367
00:38:58.318 --> 00:39:00.479
I suppose I must be. Jim Ross.

368
00:39:00.921 --> 00:39:01.945
Tome McWhirter.

369
00:39:02.623 --> 00:39:04.523
Any time you feel
like dropping around, huh?


370
00:39:05.292 --> 00:39:06.657
I'll do that. Thank you.

371
00:40:21.301 --> 00:40:22.461
You're a problem, Preston.

372
00:40:22.736 --> 00:40:23.828
You see, while you've been away,

373
00:40:24.071 --> 00:40:26.335
young Mayhurst has
been heading up your section.


374
00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:29.065
And he's done
an excellent job very thorough so


375
00:40:29.276 --> 00:40:32.507
of course it would be grossly unfair
to push him back to his second slot now


376
00:40:32.779 --> 00:40:36.476
But, as luck would have it,
a vacancy has suddenly appeared.


377
00:40:37.551 --> 00:40:38.848
In C5.

378
00:40:41.755 --> 00:40:43.120
C5!

379
00:40:43.957 --> 00:40:45.618
That's airports and ports, isn't it?

380
00:40:45.959 --> 00:40:47.620
Do you know, I do believe it is.

381
00:40:47.928 --> 00:40:51.022
But I think you could look on it as
a real career move.


382
00:40:53.167 --> 00:40:56.728
Well, you can't keep a good man down,
can you Mr Smith?


383
00:40:58.205 --> 00:41:00.673
Well, I expect your talents
will be equally appreciated


384
00:41:00.908 --> 00:41:02.307
in airports and ports.

385
00:41:05.212 --> 00:41:07.237
John this telex just came in for you.

386
00:41:07.447 --> 00:41:09.415
Give it to 'young Mayhurst'.

387
00:41:09.616 --> 00:41:10.878
I don't work here anymore.

388
00:41:11.084 --> 00:41:12.278
Where are you working then?

389
00:41:12.519 --> 00:41:14.578
In airports and bloody ports.

390
00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:36.640
Hey, seaman?

391
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.307
Where's your pass?

392
00:41:39.379 --> 00:41:41.040
Did you forget something?

393
00:41:41.248 --> 00:41:42.374
What's in your bag?

394
00:42:03.737 --> 00:42:05.204
Gold fillings.

395
00:42:06.139 --> 00:42:07.606
Lily white hands.

396
00:42:08.675 --> 00:42:10.108
Soft palms.

397
00:42:10.711 --> 00:42:15.375
So what we've got is a 'deckhand' from
a Russian trawler who looks like


398
00:42:15.582 --> 00:42:18.642
he's never handled anything harder
than a bar of soap coming out


399
00:42:18.852 --> 00:42:21.116
of Glasgow docks at two a.m.
In the morning.


400
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.452
No forged papers?

401
00:42:24.725 --> 00:42:26.022
Nothing unusual at all.

402
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.124
I think we better have another look
at these effects.


403
00:43:17.878 --> 00:43:18.936
It's polonium.

404
00:43:19.146 --> 00:43:20.010
What'a polonium?

405
00:43:20.714 --> 00:43:23.649
Well combined with lithium
the two together form an initiator.


406
00:43:23.850 --> 00:43:26.512
That's that's a detonator. For a bomb.

407
00:43:26.887 --> 00:43:27.751
A bomb?

408
00:43:33.427 --> 00:43:34.792
An atomic bomb.

409
00:43:39.366 --> 00:43:41.334
Pull over, Gregoriev.

410
00:43:41.568 --> 00:43:42.466
Yes sir.

411
00:43:55.115 --> 00:43:58.983
I understand you have been driving
comrade Colonel Philby lately.


412
00:43:59.353 --> 00:44:01.651
Yes, comrade general. 
Up till christmas

413
00:44:02.522 --> 00:44:03.989
Where have you been driving him?

414
00:44:09.563 --> 00:44:11.497
Gergoriev, do you know who I am?

415
00:44:15.335 --> 00:44:17.235
So tell me, where did you drive him?

416
00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:21.640
Comrade General,
I've been forbidden to...


417
00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.276
Gregoriev, you have a wife
and two children.


418
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:34.450
Do you think they will like you driving
an open jeep in Afghanistan?


419
00:44:37.591 --> 00:44:42.494
So where did you drive Colonel Philby?

420
00:44:50.337 --> 00:44:51.804
Comrade Professor Krilov?

421
00:44:52.139 --> 00:44:53.037
Yes?

422
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.032
My name is General Karpov.

423
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:58.102
May I have a word?

424
00:45:03.683 --> 00:45:04.741
Come in.

425
00:45:14.961 --> 00:45:15.950
Professor Krilov...

426
00:45:17.264 --> 00:45:21.496
In the interests of the State
I want you to tell me the plan


427
00:45:21.735 --> 00:45:24.966
that you and Philby have
been discussing with Govorshin.


428
00:45:25.172 --> 00:45:26.696
What authority have you got for this?

429
00:45:27.374 --> 00:45:30.639
My authority is my rank and my service.

430
00:45:31.211 --> 00:45:34.112
If you have no singed authority
from the Comrade General Chairman


431
00:45:34.314 --> 00:45:35.440
you hve no authority at all.

432
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:39.908
In fact I might draw his attention
to your line of questioning.


433
00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.415
That might not be a very good idea.

434
00:45:43.924 --> 00:45:46.722
Did you know that Philby
has already gone missing?


435
00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.224
What do you mean "gone missing"?

436
00:45:49.429 --> 00:45:50.361
Disappeared.

437
00:45:51.231 --> 00:45:53.222
The rumour is that he is dead.

438
00:45:54.167 --> 00:45:55.293
Shot.

439
00:45:55.535 --> 00:45:57.002
On Govorshin's orders.

440
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:59.033
Well, that is not my concern.

441
00:45:59.673 --> 00:46:02.107
Then man is reckless and weak.

442
00:46:02.742 --> 00:46:04.437
No doubt he has overstepped the mark.

443
00:46:05.912 --> 00:46:07.777
That mark is easily overstepped.

444
00:46:10.016 --> 00:46:13.474
You have a son for instance.

445
00:46:23.263 --> 00:46:27.097
But this can't be.

446
00:46:37.944 --> 00:46:44.213
You know, we do not tolerate
these "golden boys".


447
00:46:44.584 --> 00:46:51.387
Five years in a labour camp
not everyone survives that endure


448
00:46:51.825 --> 00:46:56.956
it the beatings the sodomy...

449
00:46:59.132 --> 00:47:01.532
I regard this report
this report as alarmist,


450
00:47:01.735 --> 00:47:03.862
irresponsible and supported
by insufficient evidence.


451
00:47:04.137 --> 00:47:05.536
Evidence? Can't you read!?!

452
00:47:05.872 --> 00:47:10.241
That metal disc can only be used
as part of a trigger for an ATOM BOMB.


453
00:47:10.443 --> 00:47:11.967
That remains to be seen.

454
00:47:12.812 --> 00:47:14.541
Don't think I don't know
what's going on, Preston.


455
00:47:14.848 --> 00:47:16.975
You're trying to worm your way back
into favour by dreaming


456
00:47:17.183 --> 00:47:19.708
up some far fetched drama
of which you yourself,


457
00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:21.080
naturally, are the hero.

458
00:47:21.321 --> 00:47:24.051
And and you're kicking out anybody
who doesn't make themselves available


459
00:47:24.257 --> 00:47:25.155
to kiss your arse!

460
00:47:25.358 --> 00:47:27.918
But if you were to look at
this thing straight just for a moment,


461
00:47:28.128 --> 00:47:30.460
you might see that
there's something going on out there!


462
00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:34.257
It is my prerogative, as head
of this country's Security Service...


463
00:47:34.501 --> 00:47:35.991
Acting head, sunshine...

464
00:47:36.369 --> 00:47:38.769
But if you ask me you're acting like
a complete arsehole!


465
00:47:46.479 --> 00:47:56.479
No further action and you are suspended
for insubordination.


466
00:47:59.759 --> 00:48:01.124
Indefinitely.

467
00:48:05.599 --> 00:48:06.190
Look what we've got here!

468
00:48:06.433 --> 00:48:07.058
Nah!

469
00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:11.669
What, you think I'll get out of
this bloody carriage for you bloody wog


470
00:48:11.871 --> 00:48:14.339
Yeah! Fuck off back to the jungle!

471
00:48:14.541 --> 00:48:16.031
Want to go somewhere?

472
00:48:16.276 --> 00:48:17.436
Get out!

473
00:48:17.644 --> 00:48:19.908
Wake up all you black passengers!

474
00:48:20.113 --> 00:48:24.209
Fuck off back to the jungle then!

475
00:48:24.417 --> 00:48:27.318
And take your
Commie fucking brass mates with you.


476
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.087
What's your problem, toerag?

477
00:48:32.325 --> 00:48:33.724
You two related?

478
00:48:33.927 --> 00:48:35.019
Eh?

479
00:48:56.616 --> 00:48:57.139
Hello, Joa.

480
00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:58.248
Hello.

481
00:48:58.752 --> 00:48:59.878
I'm staying in tonight.

482
00:49:00.153 --> 00:49:01.552
You can take the evening off
if you want to.


483
00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:08.221
Hi, Dad.

484
00:49:08.862 --> 00:49:09.760
Hi, Tiger.

485
00:49:12.632 --> 00:49:13.326
Who's winning?

486
00:49:13.566 --> 00:49:14.498
I am!

487
00:49:19.973 --> 00:49:22.942
And police reports indicated
that rioting continued today


488
00:49:23.143 --> 00:49:27.045
in townships outside Johannesbourg,
Pretoria and Cape Town...


489
00:49:27.914 --> 00:49:28.903
Come on, Tiger.

490
00:49:29.683 --> 00:49:30.945
Bed.

491
00:49:31.384 --> 00:49:34.319
Scuffles broke out today between
demonstrators and police


492
00:49:34.521 --> 00:49:37.456
as a further squadron of American
F1-11 Strike Bombers


493
00:49:37.657 --> 00:49:47.657
arrived at the US Airforce Base of
Baywaters had flown non stop from Texas


494
00:49:48.268 --> 00:49:50.099
refuelling in mid Atlantic.

495
00:50:54.501 --> 00:50:55.433
Hey!

496
00:51:00.206 --> 00:51:01.537
You looking for someone?

497
00:51:02.375 --> 00:51:03.808
No. No, not really.

498
00:51:06.312 --> 00:51:08.303
You got a room here?

499
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:12.980
No. But I've got my car.

500
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:17.222
Let's go then.

501
00:52:57.757 --> 00:53:01.386
Hey Jim me and Eileen been figuring
you could use a little entertainment.


502
00:53:05.565 --> 00:53:07.533
Well actually, I'm rather busy,
at the moment.


503
00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.428
Well, hell you ain't too busy
to be watching TV


504
00:53:11.537 --> 00:53:13.698
why don't you come down
to the Base for a few beers?


505
00:53:14.307 --> 00:53:16.104
Yes, alright. Thank you,
that would be lovely.


506
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:18.903
Um just give me a couple
of minutes, okay?


507
00:53:42.502 --> 00:53:44.299
Ever done any bowling, Jimmy?

508
00:53:52.145 --> 00:53:53.635
Goddamn!

509
00:53:56.482 --> 00:53:57.608
You're pretty good, Jimmy.

510
00:53:57.817 --> 00:53:59.182
Yeah, too damn good.

511
00:54:00.253 --> 00:54:02.414
I think we'd better find something
I can beat you at.


512
00:54:08.861 --> 00:54:09.987
Push another?

513
00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:15.658
Oh! Now don't tell me
you've reached your limit, Jimmy boy!


514
00:54:16.469 --> 00:54:19.336
Well, I usually try and stop after
a gallon or so.


515
00:54:19.973 --> 00:54:21.099
No shit.

516
00:54:22.408 --> 00:54:25.104
Marty come here.

517
00:54:25.812 --> 00:54:30.511
Give us two large Moscow Mules Pronto!

518
00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:34.616
Maybe that's kick a hole
in that famous British reserve.


519
00:54:47.133 --> 00:54:51.229
Na zdrovye that's rusky for "up yours".

520
00:54:53.339 --> 00:54:55.136
Narza drovier.

521
00:55:26.773 --> 00:55:33.008
Cool you British are real cool.

522
00:55:34.914 --> 00:55:38.111
Most of these boys are just all hat
and no cattle.


523
00:55:40.586 --> 00:55:42.076
Sounds painful.

524
00:55:45.658 --> 00:55:47.751
I ought to be getting back, Eileen.

525
00:55:48.828 --> 00:55:49.726
Yeah?

526
00:55:52.799 --> 00:55:53.959
Okay.

527
00:56:04.944 --> 00:56:06.878
Yeah, you get real bored around here.

528
00:56:07.747 --> 00:56:10.045
These people treat us like such dopes.

529
00:56:11.317 --> 00:56:15.720
To tell the truth I sometimes wonder
what we're doing here at all.


530
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:19.014
Yes, I can understand that.

531
00:56:25.631 --> 00:56:27.394
Do you get bored too, Jimmy?

532
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:32.199
Bored stiff?

533
00:56:41.781 --> 00:56:43.248
I ought to be getting back.

534
00:57:30.429 --> 00:57:31.623
Come to fly a kite, Sir?

535
00:57:35.701 --> 00:57:36.668
Now, I'll land it.

536
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:38.500
Very good.

537
00:57:39.138 --> 00:57:41.698
Go and get it, Tim.

538
00:57:41.908 --> 00:57:43.307
It's an interesting report, John.

539
00:57:43.876 --> 00:57:45.673
You're pretty sure about this, I take it

540
00:57:45.945 --> 00:57:46.639
That somewhere out there

541
00:57:46.846 --> 00:57:48.973
there's a soviet agent assembling
an atomic bomb?


542
00:57:50.683 --> 00:57:51.741
Yes.

543
00:57:58.191 --> 00:57:59.283
Don't suppose you heard

544
00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:03.695
a sleep transmitter has
just gone active in East Anglia.


545
00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:04.794
Sent two messages.

546
00:58:04.997 --> 00:58:06.464
First, two weeks ago.

547
00:58:07.033 --> 00:58:10.628
But the second soon after
your glasgow incident.


548
00:58:11.704 --> 00:58:13.729
So he's already asked for
a replacement disc.


549
00:58:16.642 --> 00:58:20.203
And if you were still on the case how
would you track him down?


550
00:58:22.381 --> 00:58:24.474
Well, we know
he's at least one component short.


551
00:58:25.184 --> 00:58:27.709
I would start by working
on recent immigration records


552
00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:29.410
of all Soviet Block citizens.

553
00:58:29.889 --> 00:58:31.117
Try to pick out the courier.

554
00:58:33.993 --> 00:58:36.223
Alright I can get you those records.

555
00:58:36.429 --> 00:58:37.760
I'll have them brouth round
to your flat.


556
00:58:40.132 --> 00:58:41.258
Okay.

557
00:58:41.734 --> 00:58:43.759
Just keep Harcourt Smith off my back.

558
00:58:44.103 --> 00:58:46.571
Oh, he's much too busy working on
his Knighthood.


559
00:58:49.442 --> 00:58:50.534
Timmy!

560
00:58:53.246 --> 00:58:54.804
First of all,
there'd be a core of uranium.


561
00:58:55.014 --> 00:58:57.039
Probably round and about five inches
in diameter.


562
00:58:57.283 --> 00:59:01.743
Now there'd be a two inch diameter hole
right through the centre.


563
00:59:02.221 --> 00:59:06.021
Over here we have
a two inch diameter ord.


564
00:59:06.492 --> 00:59:08.392
Also uranium 235.

565
00:59:08.761 --> 00:59:12.561
Now when the rod is rammed into
the heart of the fissionable core


566
00:59:12.798 --> 00:59:13.423
the mass

567
00:59:13.666 --> 00:59:17.124
of the two together rises beyond
the critical threshold.


568
00:59:17.536 --> 00:59:19.595
And that's when things start
to get exciting.


569
00:59:19.905 --> 00:59:23.500
The fissionable core will explode only
if at the moment of criticality


570
00:59:23.709 --> 00:59:26.269
it's bombarded by a blizzard
of neutrons and the blizzard


571
00:59:26.479 --> 00:59:28.743
is created by the initiator...

572
00:59:28.948 --> 00:59:29.937
Lithium...

573
00:59:30.149 --> 00:59:31.343
And polonium...

574
00:59:31.784 --> 00:59:35.242
what is it that wends the plug down
the tube into the mass?


575
00:59:36.055 --> 00:59:39.024
Any old plastic explosive.
I believe you know about that.


576
00:59:40.926 --> 00:59:43.918
So what we're looking for
is some plastic explosive


577
00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:48.590
a detonator tow small discs a tube...

578
00:59:49.302 --> 00:59:53.295
A round metal case
and a rod of uranium

579
00:59:53.706 --> 00:59:55.071
And the uranium ball.

580
00:59:55.341 --> 00:59:56.933
The thing about uranium, it's heavy.

581
00:59:57.176 --> 00:59:58.404
Twice as heavy as lead.

582
00:59:59.378 --> 01:00:01.869
That ball alone would take
a strong man to life two handed.


583
01:00:02.782 --> 01:00:06.650
But in size it's about as big as
a small football?


584
01:00:07.353 --> 01:00:08.752
Nearer a child's football.

585
01:00:34.313 --> 01:00:38.773
If an atomic bomb explodes on
an american base they'll be blamed


586
01:00:39.073 --> 01:00:40.335
For a nuclear accident.

587
01:00:40.742 --> 01:00:42.141
The British will kick them out.

588
01:00:42.777 --> 01:00:44.244
That will destroy NATO.

589
01:00:44.946 --> 01:00:47.938
But if Petrofsky is caught
with those components Russia


590
01:00:48.149 --> 01:00:50.413
will be blamed for breaking
the Fourth Protocol.


591
01:00:51.085 --> 01:00:53.781
Govorshin would have forced us back
into the cold war.


592
01:00:57.959 --> 01:00:59.620
Denounce him to the President.

593
01:01:00.728 --> 01:01:01.956
On what evidence?

594
01:01:02.263 --> 01:01:04.254
Well, what about this professor,
er, Krilov?


595
01:01:04.466 --> 01:01:05.296
Krilov.

596
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.467
Krilov.

597
01:01:07.435 --> 01:01:09.926
Krilov will change his story
in five minutes.


598
01:01:10.338 --> 01:01:11.771
Will he live that long?

599
01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.972
And then Govorshin
would simply destroy me.


600
01:01:15.176 --> 01:01:16.336
He can destroy us all.

601
01:01:18.413 --> 01:01:20.881
Govorshin need not last forever.

602
01:01:23.952 --> 01:01:25.852
I want to die in my bed.

603
01:01:27.155 --> 01:01:28.952
No I can't.

604
01:01:32.727 --> 01:01:36.527
So what will you do?

605
01:01:37.832 --> 01:01:39.823
Watch.

606
01:01:41.436 --> 01:01:42.767
Wait...

607
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:49.199
Hi!

608
01:02:49.404 --> 01:02:50.098
Good evening.

609
01:04:56.731 --> 01:04:57.663
Next please.

610
01:05:04.439 --> 01:05:06.100
May I have
a look at your ticket please?


611
01:05:10.344 --> 01:05:11.276
Thank you.

612
01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:20.282
Thank you, sir.

613
01:05:20.521 --> 01:05:21.317
Dunker.

614
01:05:44.846 --> 01:05:46.074
Hi, Tiger.

615
01:05:47.749 --> 01:05:49.341
Haven't you finished playing yet?

616
01:05:49.517 --> 01:05:50.506
Not yet.

617
01:05:51.219 --> 01:05:52.481
Can I have a go?

618
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:57.748
Press one of those, there.

619
01:05:59.961 --> 01:06:05.365
Charne is from East Germany Dussiaux,
where's he from?


620
01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.999
Jugoslavia.

621
01:06:09.837 --> 01:06:11.395
Is from...

622
01:06:11.606 --> 01:06:13.096
Czechoslovakia.

623
01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:19.007
And from Poland.

624
01:06:19.213 --> 01:06:20.202
Poland.

625
01:06:20.815 --> 01:06:24.444
And they all came into Heathrow
in Frebruary and March


626
01:06:24.652 --> 01:06:28.213
and nobody can pronounce their names...

627
01:07:15.469 --> 01:07:16.731
Mrs Vatanen?

628
01:07:17.638 --> 01:07:19.367
How was your journey from Finland?

629
01:07:20.474 --> 01:07:22.066
Very comfortable, thank you.

630
01:07:22.543 --> 01:07:24.010
Mr Ross.

631
01:07:25.813 --> 01:07:27.405
Let me take your bags.

632
01:07:43.898 --> 01:07:46.594
Irina Vassilievna
of the soviet Army Artillery,


633
01:07:46.801 --> 01:07:47.768
Research directorate...

634
01:07:47.969 --> 01:07:50.938
Specialising in the design
and con struction of atomic shells.


635
01:07:51.138 --> 01:07:51.729
I know.

636
01:07:51.939 --> 01:07:52.997
Valeri Petrofsky. 
How do you do?

637
01:07:53.207 --> 01:07:54.174
How do you do?

638
01:07:54.375 --> 01:07:55.842
Unfortunately we have a problem though.

639
01:07:56.377 --> 01:07:58.038
We're still missing one component.

640
01:07:59.914 --> 01:08:01.211
We got your message...

641
01:08:18.933 --> 01:08:19.831
Yeah?

642
01:08:20.067 --> 01:08:21.034
John. We've got a break.

643
01:08:21.235 --> 01:08:21.792
Barry. What is it?

644
01:08:22.003 --> 01:08:23.402
It's the lead we've been looking for.

645
01:08:23.604 --> 01:08:24.263
Yeah.

646
01:08:24.472 --> 01:08:25.336
I'm on my way.

647
01:08:25.539 --> 01:08:26.301
I'll be ready.

648
01:09:03.311 --> 01:09:04.335
This way.

649
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:09.407
Here we are.

650
01:09:15.957 --> 01:09:17.390
Where are you sleeping?

651
01:09:18.993 --> 01:09:21.052
We're husband and wife, remember.

652
01:09:22.263 --> 01:09:24.322
I think not, comrade Major.

653
01:09:47.088 --> 01:09:48.282
So what have we got?

654
01:09:48.556 --> 01:09:50.524
Austrian by the name of Winkler.

655
01:09:51.192 --> 01:09:52.750
He had a duff visa.

656
01:09:53.027 --> 01:09:56.622
So immigration checked out pass port
it was forged all right.


657
01:09:56.831 --> 01:09:59.561
And Winkler was the name of a spy
the FBI busted three years ago


658
01:09:59.767 --> 01:10:00.927
in California.

659
01:10:01.635 --> 01:10:04.502
We ran him through the computer
found out his real name


660
01:10:04.705 --> 01:10:06.832
was Ivan Komishenko.

661
01:10:07.041 --> 01:10:10.272
KGB Agent specialising
in radio equipment.


662
01:10:10.978 --> 01:10:12.343
The transmitter in East Anglia?

663
01:10:12.546 --> 01:10:14.673
Yes and we've just heard he's booked
on the six thirty


664
01:10:14.882 --> 01:10:16.076
to Colochester tonight.

665
01:10:16.984 --> 01:10:18.417
We've got fifteen minutes!

666
01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:20.244
We'd better get a move on.

667
01:10:20.888 --> 01:10:22.150
I'm doing my best, John.

668
01:10:23.157 --> 01:10:26.126
Passengers with tickets for
the eighteen thirty


669
01:10:26.327 --> 01:10:33.199
from Platform 9 calling at Shenfield,
Chelmsford and Colchester...


670
01:10:35.169 --> 01:10:36.397
Where will I be working?

671
01:10:36.604 --> 01:10:38.731
Upstairs. In the attic.

672
01:10:55.489 --> 01:10:59.016
So how about a drink?

673
01:12:36.924 --> 01:12:38.084
Don't!

674
01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:40.292
Keep that away from the ball.

675
01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:37.641
How big is this bomb going to be?

676
01:13:38.219 --> 01:13:39.618
One and a half kilotons.

677
01:13:41.889 --> 01:13:44.050
It should devastate
about two square miles.


678
01:13:47.962 --> 01:13:49.327
That's a lot of damage...

679
01:13:51.465 --> 01:13:53.899
I imagine
it'll kill somewhere between two


680
01:13:54.101 --> 01:13:55.500
and five thousand people...

681
01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:44.550
Hand me that battery.

682
01:18:48.428 --> 01:18:49.725
Tighten those strutts, will you.

683
01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:16.512
There we are. Armed and primed.

684
01:19:17.491 --> 01:19:20.289
Now you'll have two hours.

685
01:19:23.263 --> 01:19:28.064
To detonate turn
the key niney degress clockwise.


686
01:19:28.268 --> 01:19:28.962
Press the button.

687
01:19:29.169 --> 01:19:30.466
Then the timer's running.

688
01:19:31.138 --> 01:19:32.571
Is that clear?

689
01:19:37.978 --> 01:19:39.343
Okay let's move this.

690
01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:56.454
And when do I get the '
Go' signal...?

691
01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:59.255
The Radio Moscow English newcast's
at nine.


692
01:20:02.102 --> 01:20:02.693
When you hear

693
01:20:02.903 --> 01:20:04.928
the words 'Colonel Gaddafi'
in the third item...


694
01:20:05.172 --> 01:20:06.400
Colonel Gaddafi, okay.

695
01:20:06.607 --> 01:20:09.075
Wait. And I have to give you this.

696
01:21:16.076 --> 01:21:17.202
Is everything alright?

697
01:21:17.978 --> 01:21:19.206
Yes.

698
01:21:19.446 --> 01:21:22.244
Just confirming your instructions.

699
01:21:22.749 --> 01:21:27.049
I turn the key clockwise press
the button then


700
01:21:27.287 --> 01:21:29.881
I have two hours before detonation.

701
01:21:30.123 --> 01:21:31.613
Yes. Two hours.

702
01:21:40.367 --> 01:21:42.232
It suppose to tell Moscow already

703
01:21:51.645 --> 01:21:53.010
Before I go...

704
01:21:55.382 --> 01:21:56.849
I thought you'd get to that.

705
01:23:45.492 --> 01:23:46.481
Don't.

706
01:23:47.093 --> 01:23:48.060
The key...

707
01:24:00.841 --> 01:24:03.105
Your friend's arrived, 
Mr Hardcastle.

708
01:24:03.577 --> 01:24:04.737
Oh, thanks.

709
01:24:06.046 --> 01:24:06.740
Thank you.

710
01:24:10.483 --> 01:24:11.950
Hi, Barry. What did you find out?

711
01:24:12.319 --> 01:24:14.514
The place is owned
by two Greek Cypriots.


712
01:24:15.021 --> 01:24:18.115
Entered the country in '76 must
have been in deep cover ever since.


713
01:24:18.792 --> 01:24:21.317
The KGB's really pulling out
the family silver on this one.


714
01:24:21.661 --> 01:24:23.561
Does Irvine think
the transmitter's based here?


715
01:24:23.763 --> 01:24:25.526
Yeah. How about Winkler?

716
01:24:25.732 --> 01:24:28.223
He still in there?
Who did you bring with you?


717
01:24:28.435 --> 01:24:31.029
George. He's parked
in a company Transit down the road.


718
01:24:31.238 --> 01:24:31.863
Ah, well.

719
01:24:32.072 --> 01:24:35.166
You boys have everything covered
so I think I'll go and get some sleep.


720
01:24:54.527 --> 01:24:55.494
John.

721
01:24:55.829 --> 01:24:56.318
What is it?

722
01:24:56.563 --> 01:24:57.530
Winkler's leaving.

723
01:24:57.764 --> 01:24:58.662
Let him go.

724
01:24:59.599 --> 01:25:01.362
But he could be out
of the country by tomorrow.


725
01:25:01.568 --> 01:25:04.503
So he'll tell Moscow that
the Maldon transmitter is secure


726
01:25:04.704 --> 01:25:06.069
and recently serviced.

727
01:25:08.008 --> 01:25:09.703
Winkler's only small fry.

728
01:25:11.611 --> 01:25:13.772
I think the jackpot's in that cafe.

729
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:17.878
And I fell lucky.

730
01:25:34.901 --> 01:25:38.564
Anti nuclear protesters have continued
to stream into Suffolk in preparation


731
01:25:38.772 --> 01:25:40.763
for tomorrows demonstration
at Baywaters


732
01:25:40.974 --> 01:25:42.703
the American Strike bomber Base.

733
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:45.239
Cruise Out! Yanks Out!

734
01:25:45.445 --> 01:25:48.073
The organisers of the really claim
that by tomorrow attendance


735
01:25:48.281 --> 01:25:52.274
would top 50,000 in protest at
the tactical nuclear weapons carried


736
01:25:52.485 --> 01:25:54.419
by the F1-11's based there.

737
01:25:54.921 --> 01:25:57.412
They said the demonstration would make
it's point...


738
01:25:57.691 --> 01:25:58.885
John? Barry?

739
01:25:59.693 --> 01:26:01.160
There's a man standing at the end
of the road.


740
01:26:01.461 --> 01:26:03.554
A Suffold Police Spokesman said
they were never...


741
01:26:03.763 --> 01:26:04.730
What does he look like?

742
01:26:05.365 --> 01:26:07.993
Tall. Well built. 
Wearing a raincoat.

743
01:26:09.102 --> 01:26:11.070
He looks as though
he's carrying something.


744
01:26:11.738 --> 01:26:12.898
He's moving towards the cafe.

745
01:26:14.474 --> 01:26:16.135
Arrived by car, rail and on foot.

746
01:26:16.343 --> 01:26:21.076
Many preparing to spend
the night at the Base...


747
01:26:21.748 --> 01:26:22.578
Got him.

748
01:26:23.049 --> 01:26:23.981
Let me see.

749
01:26:30.023 --> 01:26:31.149
What's he carrying?

750
01:26:31.391 --> 01:26:32.358
I don't know.

751
01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:35.718
It's a motorcycle helmet!!!

752
01:26:46.873 --> 01:26:48.898
Get over to the chalet, George,
and stand by the phone.


753
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.803
Right.

754
01:26:54.647 --> 01:26:55.409
John?

755
01:26:55.715 --> 01:26:56.477
Yeah?

756
01:26:56.783 --> 01:26:59.149
I've found the motorbike.
Engine's still hot.


757
01:27:00.153 --> 01:27:01.916
Fix a bleeper and come back here.

758
01:27:09.896 --> 01:27:10.487
Yes?

759
01:27:10.697 --> 01:27:13.097
A message from the transmitter
in Britain, General Govorshin.


760
01:27:13.299 --> 01:27:15.199
"Everything in place. 
Awaiting signal."

761
01:27:18.104 --> 01:27:18.968
Very well.

762
01:27:19.172 --> 01:27:20.230
Sir.

763
01:28:05.351 --> 01:28:05.942
George...

764
01:28:06.152 --> 01:28:06.811
Yes, John?

765
01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.981
Tell Irvine to hit the Greeks now.

766
01:28:09.255 --> 01:28:10.222
You guide them in.

767
01:28:26.473 --> 01:28:28.031
Alright. Take the next left.

768
01:28:34.314 --> 01:28:35.611
And then right.

769
01:28:37.584 --> 01:28:38.983
This guy's really moving!

770
01:28:56.069 --> 01:28:57.093
Where are we now?

771
01:28:57.871 --> 01:29:00.533
We're into Suffolk
and heading towards Ipswich.


772
01:29:06.746 --> 01:29:09.579
He's stopped. In town.

773
01:29:29.502 --> 01:29:30.901
And then right again at the next one.

774
01:29:32.906 --> 01:29:34.134
He's still there.

775
01:29:35.642 --> 01:29:37.132
That's over four miuntes.

776
01:29:46.252 --> 01:29:47.412
This must be it.

777
01:30:26.359 --> 01:30:27.451
What's happening?

778
01:30:28.061 --> 01:30:28.789
There's been a big accident!

779
01:30:28.995 --> 01:30:30.428
The main road's blocked.

780
01:31:03.663 --> 01:31:04.789
Hang on, Barry.

781
01:31:32.825 --> 01:31:34.417
Alright. Keep moving.

782
01:32:07.593 --> 01:32:08.184
Now come on through.

783
01:32:08.428 --> 01:32:09.292
Move it!

784
01:32:12.198 --> 01:32:13.495
Move along now.

785
01:32:18.237 --> 01:32:19.169
Barry!

786
01:32:19.706 --> 01:32:20.638
Pull out!

787
01:32:23.343 --> 01:32:24.605
Pull out, quickly!

788
01:32:29.248 --> 01:32:30.146
Come on!

789
01:32:32.985 --> 01:32:34.316
Midblue XR3!

790
01:32:36.155 --> 01:32:36.951
Stop!

791
01:32:37.190 --> 01:32:37.986
Stop now!

792
01:33:10.156 --> 01:33:11.589
Who signed for this van?

793
01:33:12.392 --> 01:33:13.359
You did.

794
01:33:26.172 --> 01:33:27.400
RAF Baywaters?

795
01:33:27.607 --> 01:33:29.040
It's the American Nuclear Base.

796
01:33:29.242 --> 01:33:30.470
That's where he's heading!

797
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:51.692
He's turned off to the right.

798
01:34:01.641 --> 01:34:02.869
Looks like a dead end.

799
01:34:04.744 --> 01:34:06.735
Keep trying for about half a mile.

800
01:34:07.613 --> 01:34:09.376
I'll be in touch.

801
01:34:52.592 --> 01:34:54.423
Two people who are believed
to be responsible


802
01:34:54.627 --> 01:34:58.654
for the attack later shot dead
by soldiers we'll hve our next news


803
01:34:58.865 --> 01:34:59.661
at 11 o'clock.

804
01:35:12.645 --> 01:35:14.237
Good morning, madam.
I've come to read the meter.


805
01:35:14.447 --> 01:35:15.072
What, now?

806
01:35:15.281 --> 01:35:16.339
My identification.

807
01:35:37.904 --> 01:35:39.531
Jim ross that's right, yeah.

808
01:35:39.739 --> 01:35:41.001
How long has he lived here?

809
01:35:42.341 --> 01:35:43.433
Two months.

810
01:35:44.143 --> 01:35:45.167
Does he live alone?

811
01:35:45.444 --> 01:35:47.344
Er, no. A woman arrived
the day before yesterday.


812
01:35:47.547 --> 01:35:48.741
I think it's his wife.

813
01:35:49.448 --> 01:35:50.881
So what's all this about then?

814
01:35:53.152 --> 01:35:55.017
I want to borrow this house
for a little while.


815
01:35:55.421 --> 01:35:56.547
What?!

816
01:35:57.023 --> 01:36:00.584
That's not his wife over there,
you know. He murdered his wife


817
01:36:00.826 --> 01:36:02.885
and three children with a shotgun.

818
01:36:03.129 --> 01:36:04.357
Oh my God!

819
01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.247
This is serving
the North American service


820
01:36:22.448 --> 01:36:26.441
of Radio Moscow just in case you tuned
in late I'm Nikolai Kornakov


821
01:36:26.652 --> 01:36:28.677
and I'd like to remind you that with me
in the studio


822
01:36:28.921 --> 01:36:31.048
are two Soviet jazz critics
Alexei Sattin


823
01:36:31.290 --> 01:36:36.421
and Demetri Drkov and we're going
to listen to some in depth jazz.


824
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:37.493
Coming to you

825
01:36:37.697 --> 01:36:38.857
on the North American Service
of Radio Moscow.


826
01:36:55.481 --> 01:36:58.211
Our friend is
in Cherryhayes Close north west


827
01:36:58.417 --> 01:36:59.509
of the Air Base.

828
01:36:59.785 --> 01:37:01.412
I'm in the house opposite, number 14.

829
01:37:01.721 --> 01:37:04.053
It's the solar house at the end
of the road.


830
01:37:04.890 --> 01:37:07.825
Come in over the waste ground at
the rear. The back door is open.


831
01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:08.856
Out.

832
01:37:15.501 --> 01:37:20.598
Sir Nigel Irvine,
please from Radio Moscow...


833
01:37:24.610 --> 01:37:26.840
Hello, everybody. Today we announce
the results


834
01:37:27.046 --> 01:37:29.139
of our russian language contest...

835
01:37:48.434 --> 01:37:49.958
I'm in here, Barry.

836
01:37:55.875 --> 01:37:57.365
Upstairs front bedroom.

837
01:37:57.777 --> 01:37:58.971
Number 12.

838
01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:01.142
I think there's someone
in the attic as well.


839
01:38:06.585 --> 01:38:07.051
Preston?

840
01:38:07.253 --> 01:38:07.742
Hello, Chief.

841
01:38:07.953 --> 01:38:08.578
So you found the man...

842
01:38:08.821 --> 01:38:11.221
Yes. He's in the house next to
the American Air Base at Baywaters...


843
01:38:11.424 --> 01:38:12.049
Well, we'll have to get him then.

844
01:38:12.291 --> 01:38:13.258
Yes, I think we should.

845
01:39:15.654 --> 01:39:16.916
Geroge. Bill. Let's go.

846
01:39:30.469 --> 01:39:32.494
Captain Lyndhurst.
Assault Team Commander. Is Preston here


847
01:39:32.705 --> 01:39:33.637
Through there.

848
01:39:38.844 --> 01:39:39.936
I'm Julian Lyndhurst.

849
01:39:40.212 --> 01:39:42.112
John Preston.
Have they told you anything?


850
01:39:42.314 --> 01:39:43.576
Just that he's a terrorist.

851
01:39:43.783 --> 01:39:45.478
Oh, he's more than just a terrorist.

852
01:39:46.252 --> 01:39:48.345
He is a top Soviet agent.

853
01:39:48.754 --> 01:39:49.618
A pro.

854
01:39:51.590 --> 01:39:52.557
Is he alone?

855
01:39:53.159 --> 01:39:54.456
Maybe there's a woman in there.

856
01:39:54.994 --> 01:39:56.222
He's armed. With a bomb.

857
01:39:58.264 --> 01:39:59.458
How big a bomb?

858
01:40:00.766 --> 01:40:01.755
Atomic bomb.

859
01:40:19.952 --> 01:40:29.952
Deep in our hearts I do belive that
we shall overcome some day.


860
01:42:41.493 --> 01:42:43.188
The time is nine o'clock.

861
01:42:43.495 --> 01:42:44.018
You are listening

862
01:42:44.263 --> 01:42:46.959
to the English Language Service
of Radio Moscow.


863
01:42:47.299 --> 01:42:49.096
And here is the news.

864
01:42:49.301 --> 01:42:51.064
You're reader, Paul...

865
01:42:51.804 --> 01:42:52.828
In Afghanistan today,

866
01:42:53.038 --> 01:42:56.633
democratic government forces assisted
by their soviet comrades


867
01:42:56.842 --> 01:42:58.207
in arms continued

868
01:42:58.377 --> 01:42:59.708
their sweep against fascist,

869
01:42:59.912 --> 01:43:02.346
CIA backed rabels
in the Panshir Valley...


870
01:43:03.248 --> 01:43:06.615
You correspondent in Kabul reports
that the Government Forces...


871
01:43:06.819 --> 01:43:09.219
Entering Cherryhayes fifteen seconds.

872
01:43:10.055 --> 01:43:10.987
Go ahead.

873
01:43:11.890 --> 01:43:14.950
Including large areas
of the valley have been liberated


874
01:43:15.194 --> 01:43:19.756
and restored to the arrival
of Government and soviet forces


875
01:43:19.965 --> 01:43:23.196
have everywhere been greeted
with dubilation by the liberated


876
01:43:30.175 --> 01:43:31.972
the Afghanis army reported
the capture of...


877
01:43:32.177 --> 01:43:33.235
Ginger?

878
01:43:33.479 --> 01:43:35.140
Hold position. There's a civilian
on the street.


879
01:43:35.514 --> 01:43:36.412
Ginger...

880
01:43:40.052 --> 01:43:41.212
Ginger.

881
01:43:42.388 --> 01:43:43.446
Come on!

882
01:43:49.361 --> 01:43:51.295
Ginger! Come on down from there!

883
01:43:52.464 --> 01:43:53.931
We're bloody exposed out here.

884
01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.400
While trying to escape to join
the rebels as lies and distortion.


885
01:43:57.603 --> 01:43:58.797
Here, Ginger!

886
01:44:01.306 --> 01:44:03.774
Continuing his tours
of collective farms


887
01:44:03.976 --> 01:44:05.102
in the Maldazian Republic...

888
01:44:05.310 --> 01:44:08.108
Ginger easy now. Ginger!

889
01:44:08.647 --> 01:44:09.443
Politburo member,

890
01:44:09.648 --> 01:44:12.412
predicted further record grain harvests
this year for soviet agriculture


891
01:44:12.618 --> 01:44:14.518
to a cheering crowd of farm workers...

892
01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:17.015
Eays. Eays.

893
01:44:21.827 --> 01:44:23.294
For Christ's sake!

894
01:44:24.930 --> 01:44:25.988
With the order of Heroes
of soviet labour...


895
01:44:26.198 --> 01:44:27.460
Ginger!

896
01:44:33.839 --> 01:44:37.866
Hogs and corn are not setting
an example to the whole nation...


897
01:44:39.545 --> 01:44:43.948
In Lybia today progressive Arab leaders
invited by the Lybian leader,


898
01:44:44.149 --> 01:44:48.586
Colonel Gaddafi met to discuss further
measures in the cntinuing struggle


899
01:44:48.821 --> 01:44:52.018
against American and Zionist
imperialism in the Middle East.


900
01:45:14.246 --> 01:45:15.213
Let me go!

901
01:45:15.414 --> 01:45:16.540
Put me down!

902
01:45:16.748 --> 01:45:17.544
Shut up!

903
01:46:45.938 --> 01:46:47.098
Go!

904
01:47:40.892 --> 01:47:42.189
Don't shoot it's me!

905
01:47:47.666 --> 01:47:48.496
Stop!

906
01:47:51.036 --> 01:47:52.469
Go back in your homes
and remain there...


907
01:47:52.671 --> 01:47:54.161
We needed to talk to him!

908
01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:58.170
Sorry, boss orders.

909
01:47:58.910 --> 01:48:00.104
Stay in doors!

910
01:48:00.312 --> 01:48:01.802
Stay away from the windows...

911
01:48:22.134 --> 01:48:22.896
I'll be a couple of minutes.

912
01:48:23.101 --> 01:48:23.931
Okay Dad.

913
01:48:24.403 --> 01:48:27.634
We are gathered here today
to give thanks to the life


914
01:48:27.839 --> 01:48:32.242
of our friend, Mr Bernard Hemmings
we are grateful for the privilege


915
01:48:32.444 --> 01:48:35.004
of having known him for all of us,

916
01:48:35.213 --> 01:48:38.842
I believe, have had our lives enriched
and enhanced


917
01:48:39.051 --> 01:48:41.144
by the example he has set us.

918
01:48:41.353 --> 01:48:44.789
For Bernard conducted himself
thorughout his distinguished career


919
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:51.395
with unfailing cheerfulness and with
generosity of spirits and with charity.


920
01:48:51.596 --> 01:48:54.429
In commemorating him today
I do not think it is too much to say...


921
01:48:54.633 --> 01:48:55.930
Excuse me. Thank you.

922
01:48:56.134 --> 01:48:59.069
That his passing marks the end
of an era.


923
01:48:59.338 --> 01:49:03.331
It is our fondest desire that
he may gain here...


924
01:49:14.686 --> 01:49:18.178
Preston what do you want?

925
01:49:30.035 --> 01:49:32.560
I've been trying to speak
to you for two weeks.


926
01:49:32.871 --> 01:49:35.032
I want to know why
the Russian was killed.


927
01:49:35.374 --> 01:49:38.036
I believe he was crawling towards
an atomic bomb at the time.


928
01:49:38.710 --> 01:49:42.077
No he wasn't. He was "executed"
on your orders.


929
01:49:43.348 --> 01:49:45.816
Or was it on yours General?

930
01:49:47.652 --> 01:49:51.179
Why did you send Winkler? Your man
with the obviously forged passport


931
01:49:51.556 --> 01:49:53.251
to lead us to Petrofsky.

932
01:49:54.626 --> 01:49:57.993
You deliberately wasted
the whole operation.


933
01:50:00.332 --> 01:50:02.095
Why did you do that, General?

934
01:50:04.069 --> 01:50:06.196
You and Irvine set it up, didn't you?

935
01:50:06.605 --> 01:50:10.701
You gave us Petrofsky in return for
the evidence that you were using


936
01:50:10.909 --> 01:50:12.638
to destroy Govorshin.

937
01:50:13.478 --> 01:50:17.244
You could well become
the next Chairman of the KGB.


938
01:50:18.383 --> 01:50:21.750
Preston you are out of your depth.

939
01:50:22.954 --> 01:50:24.922
It's all a game to you, isn't it?

940
01:50:25.757 --> 01:50:28.055
You don't give a shit
about any thing except


941
01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:30.353
your lousy careers. 
Neither of you.

942
01:50:31.897 --> 01:50:34.593
It's about time they put you
in a fucking musuem.


943
01:50:39.337 --> 01:50:40.861
Do you think he'll talk?

944
01:50:53.718 --> 01:50:54.742
Dad!

945
01:51:00.125 --> 01:51:01.092
Where are we going?

946
01:51:01.293 --> 01:51:01.952
Home.
