5
00:03:47.514 --> 00:03:49.781
Spritz!

6
00:03:52.886 --> 00:03:54.219
What are you up to?

7
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:59.457
Heidi!

8
00:04:11.304 --> 00:04:16.808
Heidi!

9
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.579
'Heidi.'

10
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:26.484
- What's a Heidi?
- I'm Heidi. What's your name?


11
00:04:26.486 --> 00:04:30.088
- Peter.
- Oh, what a cute little lamb.


12
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.424
'He's not a lamb, he's a goat.'

13
00:04:32.426 --> 00:04:34.959
'His name is Spritz
and he's not cute.'


14
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.328
I think he's adorable.

15
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.065
Hey, what are you doing up here
on Wunderhorn?


16
00:04:40.067 --> 00:04:42.500
I've come to live
with my grandfather.


17
00:04:42.502 --> 00:04:44.569
Why don't you live
with your mother and father?


18
00:04:44.571 --> 00:04:49.074
Oh, they're in heaven.

19
00:04:49.076 --> 00:04:51.176
I've been staying
with Aunt Dete.


20
00:04:51.178 --> 00:04:53.411
Uh, where does
your grandfather live?


21
00:04:53.413 --> 00:04:56.081
Way up there near the top.

22
00:04:56.083 --> 00:04:59.818
That's your grandfather?
That old bear?


23
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.821
He won't let you live with him.
He hates everybody.


24
00:05:02.823 --> 00:05:06.157
All grandfathers are nice
and they love children.


25
00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:10.695
Not this one. I know him.
I tend his goats every day.


26
00:05:10.697 --> 00:05:12.097
He can't be so terrible

27
00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.933
if he loves beautiful animals
like these.


28
00:05:14.935 --> 00:05:18.169
Last week, he sold
Spritz's mother to a butcher.


29
00:05:18.171 --> 00:05:20.271
- Khhrr.
- That's awful.


30
00:05:21.775 --> 00:05:23.641
Poor little Spritz.

31
00:05:23.643 --> 00:05:27.278
Heidi, what on earth
happened to you?


32
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.381
I had you all pretty
and now I'll have to bring you


33
00:05:30.383 --> 00:05:32.684
to the old man
looking like an urchin.


34
00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:50.201
Who are you? And what are you
doing in my mountain?


35
00:05:50.203 --> 00:05:53.838
- Where did you come from?
- I come from Maienfeld.


36
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.842
I came here 30 years ago
to get away from city people.


37
00:05:57.844 --> 00:06:00.879
I'm not a city people.
I'm just a girl.


38
00:06:00.881 --> 00:06:02.881
So? You're a girl!

39
00:06:02.883 --> 00:06:05.583
Now go away.
And leave my goat behind.


40
00:06:05.585 --> 00:06:07.051
But I'm Heidi.

41
00:06:07.053 --> 00:06:08.653
I don't care what your name is.

42
00:06:08.655 --> 00:06:10.555
I don't want you around. Go.

43
00:06:12.058 --> 00:06:14.559
But I've come to live
with you, grandfather.


44
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:17.028
- What?
- Oh, Heidi.


45
00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:18.730
Why do you call me that, girl?

46
00:06:18.732 --> 00:06:20.932
'Because you
are her grandfather.'


47
00:06:20.934 --> 00:06:25.603
Oh, I know you. You're
the sister of my son's wife.


48
00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:29.407
Yes, and this is Heidi,
your son's child.


49
00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:31.242
Why did you bring her up here?

50
00:06:31.244 --> 00:06:34.379
Your son is dead
and so is my sister.


51
00:06:34.381 --> 00:06:37.515
I've taken care of this child
for four long years


52
00:06:37.517 --> 00:06:39.751
and now it's your turn.

53
00:06:39.753 --> 00:06:44.522
My turn? You think
this is some sort of a game?


54
00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:49.394
And you there, boy,
what are you gawking at?


55
00:06:49.396 --> 00:06:51.963
'Get back to the goats
before you lose them all.'


56
00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:54.933
Gruffle, get this one back
with the others.


57
00:06:54.935 --> 00:06:56.935
'Teach him he's a goat.'

58
00:07:07.447 --> 00:07:10.582
And now, you, get back
where you belong to.


59
00:07:10.584 --> 00:07:12.150
- Oh, my…
- Go.


60
00:07:12.152 --> 00:07:16.454
- I'm never, I'm going..
- Run, run!


61
00:07:16.456 --> 00:07:19.724
And don't let me see
your face again.


62
00:07:19.726 --> 00:07:21.593
- Run!
- I'm going.


63
00:07:21.595 --> 00:07:24.562
- Run! Run!
- Ow!


64
00:07:26.733 --> 00:07:29.667
Poor Aunt Dete.
You scared her grandfather.


65
00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:33.071
Good. And you, girl,
don't I make you afraid?


66
00:07:33.073 --> 00:07:36.341
No, you're my grandfather.

67
00:07:36.343 --> 00:07:40.111
'Well, I suppose
if a man has children'


68
00:07:40.113 --> 00:07:42.480
'he must expect
to have grandchildren.'


69
00:07:42.482 --> 00:07:44.816
'But what do I know
about tending infants.'


70
00:07:44.818 --> 00:07:48.586
'I'm no infant. I could
be of help to you, grandfather.'


71
00:07:52.292 --> 00:07:54.959
What can a speck of a girl do?

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:52.750
Little girls falling off logs.

87
00:08:52.752 --> 00:08:54.919
It won't work!

88
00:08:54.921 --> 00:08:57.088

97
00:09:30.056 --> 00:09:33.057
'Oh, it's very nice.'

98
00:09:33.059 --> 00:09:37.962
It's just the way I like it.
Don't snoop and pry around.


99
00:09:37.964 --> 00:09:40.798
I'd like to put my bonnet
and shoes and things away.


100
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.201
Well, well, find a place.
I'm busy.


101
00:09:46.373 --> 00:09:48.806
Is this where you wash
your socks?


102
00:09:48.808 --> 00:09:52.176
- 'No, that's a butter churn.'
- Oh!


103
00:09:58.051 --> 00:10:00.485
Maybe I could put my things
in here.


104
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.061
Oh, now, look what you've done.

105
00:10:10.063 --> 00:10:12.730
I have no time
to fuss with the closet.


106
00:10:12.732 --> 00:10:15.133
I have more important work
to do.


107
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.339
Where will I sleep, grandfather?
There's only one bed.


108
00:10:23.176 --> 00:10:25.176
You can sleep in the hayloft.

109
00:10:27.447 --> 00:10:29.447
Oh, I'd like that.

110
00:10:42.028 --> 00:10:45.163
Oh, it's a lovely bedroom.

111
00:10:54.374 --> 00:10:56.507
It will be fun to sleep up high.

112
00:10:58.344 --> 00:11:01.379
Well, at least she knows how
to make the best of a situation.


113
00:11:19.699 --> 00:11:23.468
Does the wind always sound
so scary at night?


114
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:26.204
Those who don't know
might call it the wind


115
00:11:26.206 --> 00:11:28.239
but the people
who live in Wunderhorn


116
00:11:28.241 --> 00:11:29.674
know it's the<i>kobolds.</i>

117
00:11:29.676 --> 00:11:30.708
<i>Kobolds?</i>

118
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.076
Mountain creatures

119
00:11:32.078 --> 00:11:34.846
who live in dark
and mysterious places.


120
00:11:34.848 --> 00:11:37.348
But that was only the wind
in the chimney, wasn't it?


121
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:40.251
No, those were urchins.

122
00:11:40.253 --> 00:11:42.587
Or maybe the bogus and boggers.

123
00:11:42.589 --> 00:11:43.988
They come down out of the mists

124
00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:47.358
that swirl
around the mountain peaks.


125
00:11:48.394 --> 00:11:51.662
And now comes the gapota.

126
00:11:51.664 --> 00:11:54.165
Whenever a bogger or boggard
comes out


127
00:11:54.167 --> 00:11:57.335
a gapota isn't far behind.

128
00:11:57.337 --> 00:11:59.437
Those are the air<i>kies.</i>

129
00:11:59.439 --> 00:12:02.440
Oh, they're all out tonight.

130
00:12:02.442 --> 00:12:04.342
It's going to be bad.

131
00:12:06.379 --> 00:12:09.881
- They're very angry.
- Why are they angry?


132
00:12:09.883 --> 00:12:13.451
Because strangers invade
their mountain.


133
00:12:13.453 --> 00:12:15.386
Are there very many of them?

134
00:12:15.388 --> 00:12:19.690
Ho, ho, scores and scores.

135
00:12:19.692 --> 00:12:22.460
I was coming home late
and a bad storm blew up


136
00:12:22.462 --> 00:12:25.396
and I saw them start to come out
of their hiding places.


137
00:12:25.398 --> 00:12:27.064
<i>Kobolds?</i>

138
00:12:27.066 --> 00:12:29.433
And tulfulchin and air<i>kies</i>

139
00:12:29.435 --> 00:12:32.937
and bogus and boggers
and harpies and jinns


140
00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:35.606
and towering over them all..

141
00:12:36.809 --> 00:12:39.377
…the king of the<i>kobolds.</i>

142
00:12:39.379 --> 00:12:41.946
A monstrous creature.

143
00:12:41.948 --> 00:12:46.450
Chest of granite.
Beard of long green moss.


144
00:12:46.452 --> 00:12:50.454
Big as the top
of the mountain itself.


145
00:12:50.456 --> 00:12:53.257
Grandfather, I'm not
really a stranger, am I?


146
00:12:53.259 --> 00:12:55.826
I mean, the mountain creatures
would know


147
00:12:55.828 --> 00:12:58.196
I was your granddaughter,
wouldn't they?


148
00:13:00.733 --> 00:13:03.734
Who knows what a<i>kobold</i> thinks?

149
00:13:05.572 --> 00:13:07.705
Well, it's getting late.

150
00:13:09.342 --> 00:13:11.342
Go to bed now.

151
00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.546
Goodnight, grandfather.

158
00:16:31.377 --> 00:16:33.544
Grandfather. Grandfather!

159
00:16:33.546 --> 00:16:36.814
Wh-wh-what is the matter?

160
00:16:36.816 --> 00:16:39.817
Oh, I must have been dreaming.

161
00:16:39.819 --> 00:16:43.220
'Yeah, yeah, yeah, dreaming.
Nightmare.'


162
00:16:43.222 --> 00:16:46.857
Go back to bed and maybe
some of us will get some rest.


163
00:16:46.859 --> 00:16:48.426
Yes, grandfather.

164
00:17:38.911 --> 00:17:41.579
You, too, go for..

165
00:17:46.619 --> 00:17:48.619
Where are you going,
grandfather?


166
00:17:48.621 --> 00:17:51.789
There are things to be done.
No idleness here, girl.


167
00:18:16.582 --> 00:18:18.215
'Careful, grandfather.'

168
00:18:36.402 --> 00:18:39.837
Ah, Heidi, look out!

169
00:18:39.839 --> 00:18:43.574
Run, Heidi. Run! Run!

170
00:18:50.983 --> 00:18:53.684
Grandfather! Grandfather!

171
00:18:55.154 --> 00:18:56.854
Wh-wh-what happened?
What happened?


172
00:18:56.856 --> 00:18:59.423
Hurry, Peter.
Grandfather's under there.


173
00:19:06.265 --> 00:19:09.800
I-I found him.
I think he's dead.


174
00:19:09.802 --> 00:19:11.201
Who's dead?

175
00:19:12.471 --> 00:19:14.972
Oh, he's alright.

176
00:19:14.974 --> 00:19:18.676
'I'm not alright.
My leg is caught.'


177
00:19:18.678 --> 00:19:21.845
'Get me loose. 
Fast, boy, fast.'

178
00:19:25.885 --> 00:19:29.687
'Ooh, easy now.'

179
00:19:29.689 --> 00:19:31.455
Not too fast.

180
00:19:31.457 --> 00:19:34.391
Slow.

181
00:19:34.393 --> 00:19:37.161
'Slow.
We are not running a race.'


182
00:19:41.834 --> 00:19:43.901
Just a little more, grandfather.

183
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:53.978
Peter, Peter, go fetch
the doctor from the village.


184
00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.348
Stop. No doctor.
I'll tend to myself.


185
00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.651
- But, grandfather…
- 'My legs are not broken.'


186
00:20:00.653 --> 00:20:02.920
I'll be as good as new
in the morning.


187
00:20:02.922 --> 00:20:04.254
I'll tend to you, grandfather…

188
00:20:04.256 --> 00:20:05.856
Thirty years,
I've been felling trees…


189
00:20:05.858 --> 00:20:07.758
I'll fetch your meals
and churn the butter…


190
00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.493
And never has one
fallen on me before…


191
00:20:09.495 --> 00:20:11.395
And Peter can help
with the chores and…


192
00:20:11.397 --> 00:20:13.597
I've survived an avalanche.

193
00:20:13.599 --> 00:20:15.499
And I'll make you
real comfortable.


194
00:20:15.501 --> 00:20:17.668
Then you had to come along.

195
00:20:32.752 --> 00:20:34.918
'Good morning, Peter, Spritz.'

196
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.553
Huh, what's so good about it?

197
00:20:36.555 --> 00:20:39.456
It's good to see the bright sun
and clear sky


198
00:20:39.458 --> 00:20:42.626
and to know the harpies and
jinns and trolls weren't real.


199
00:20:42.628 --> 00:20:46.230
Maybe they're not real,
but that old man is real.


200
00:20:46.232 --> 00:20:47.865
Real mean.

201
00:20:47.867 --> 00:20:49.233
I've been trying
to milk his goats


202
00:20:49.235 --> 00:20:52.536
and every time he yells,
one of them kicks me.


203
00:20:55.307 --> 00:20:59.209
Poor grandfather, he keeps
trying to get out of bed.


204
00:20:59.211 --> 00:21:02.413
- 'Can't he walk yet?'
- He can't even stand.


205
00:21:02.415 --> 00:21:04.982
But he has to make
the butter and cheese.


206
00:21:04.984 --> 00:21:07.418
He goes down to sell them
in Dorfli every Monday.


207
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:09.987
It's how he lives
and how he pays me.


208
00:21:09.989 --> 00:21:12.823
- I'll do it.
- I don't know.


209
00:21:12.825 --> 00:21:15.159
You'll see.
Just give me the milk.


210
00:21:17.229 --> 00:21:20.464
Oh-oh. I'm glad I'll be off
the mountain all day.


211
00:21:20.466 --> 00:21:23.600
I wish I could go with you
and the goats, but..


212
00:21:23.602 --> 00:21:26.670
…there'll
be lots of time later.


213
00:21:26.672 --> 00:21:28.405
'Good morning.'

214
00:21:30.009 --> 00:21:32.710
You, that's who.

215
00:21:34.513 --> 00:21:37.081
You have such
a beautiful, new home.


216
00:21:37.083 --> 00:21:39.183
I hope I can fix up
grandfather's place


217
00:21:39.185 --> 00:21:41.218
as neat and tidy.

218
00:21:50.329 --> 00:21:52.796
It's a beautiful morning,
grandfather.


219
00:21:52.798 --> 00:21:57.601
No, it's the worst morning
of my life.


220
00:21:57.603 --> 00:22:00.938
You'll feel better when you see
how well I can tend to you.


221
00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.440
And wait till you see
how pretty I make the cottage.


222
00:22:03.442 --> 00:22:09.012
No. No, I-I warned
you not to touch anything.


223
00:22:09.014 --> 00:22:12.382
But, grandfather, your shirts
and socks need mending


224
00:22:12.384 --> 00:22:16.019
and the dishes need washing
and the floor needs sweeping.


225
00:22:16.021 --> 00:22:19.790
No. Oh. No, no, no.

226
00:22:19.792 --> 00:22:23.327
I won't have things
changed all around.


227
00:22:23.329 --> 00:22:26.230
Wouldn't you even like some
pretty curtains on the windows?


228
00:22:26.232 --> 00:22:29.399
I knew it.
You're going to ruin everything.


229
00:22:36.709 --> 00:22:39.376
Oh, this is how
a man's years end.


230
00:22:39.378 --> 00:22:42.412
Struck down by a tree,
then forced to lie on bed


231
00:22:42.414 --> 00:22:45.382
and watch his home ruined
by a snip of a girl.


232
00:22:45.384 --> 00:22:48.018
You'll like it much better
once you get used to it.


233
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.988
I'll never get used to it.
I won't even look at it.


234
00:22:56.896 --> 00:22:59.596
This is the first thing
that needs straightening.


235
00:23:01.233 --> 00:23:03.667
Now I'll never find anything.
Never.


236
00:23:07.873 --> 00:23:11.675
You'll get better soon and
we can all do things together.


237
00:23:11.677 --> 00:23:15.279
And just think. It will be
Christmas before long.


238
00:23:15.281 --> 00:23:19.082
We don't have Christmas here.
It's just another day.


239
00:23:19.084 --> 00:23:22.085
There's work to be done.
No time for foolishness.


240
00:23:22.087 --> 00:23:26.757
But, grandfather, every day can
be Christmas when you're happy.


241
00:23:26.759 --> 00:23:28.292
'We'll see.'

'I love you, grandpa.'

260
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:56.346
Well, grandfather, I milked
the goats for the first time.


261
00:24:56.348 --> 00:25:00.717
'Oh. Oh, that's better
than most do the first time.'


262
00:25:00.719 --> 00:25:03.687
I see that you've learned
to get along with the goats.


263
00:25:03.689 --> 00:25:07.524
And I think it's time you own
one of your own.


264
00:25:07.526 --> 00:25:10.961
- Huh?
- I'll give you Spritz.


265
00:25:10.963 --> 00:25:12.329
Spritz?

266
00:25:16.468 --> 00:25:19.369
'I don't know if I want him.'

267
00:25:19.371 --> 00:25:21.238
'Why don't you want him?'

268
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.142
Well, I don't know
if he'd want me.


269
00:25:27.146 --> 00:25:30.314
But if I was very kind
and took care of him


270
00:25:30.316 --> 00:25:32.382
maybe he'd learn to love me.

271
00:25:32.384 --> 00:25:34.384
He's not very lovable.

272
00:25:36.021 --> 00:25:39.423
- Would he be my very own?
- I said so, girl.


273
00:25:39.425 --> 00:25:41.692
Oh, grandfather.

274
00:25:41.694 --> 00:25:45.062
Oh, Spritz, now you're mine.

275
00:25:50.669 --> 00:25:53.704
Thank you, grandfather.
Muah, muah.


276
00:25:53.706 --> 00:25:57.007

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:35.172
- I don't believe it.
- It's true, isn't it, Spritz?


300
00:27:37.009 --> 00:27:39.342
Well, I still don't believe it.

301
00:27:39.344 --> 00:27:42.212
That old<i>kobold</i> never gave
anything to anyone.


302
00:27:42.214 --> 00:27:45.248
Come on, we'll ask grandfather
and he'll tell you it's true.


303
00:27:57.062 --> 00:27:59.696
Yeah, yeah, it's true.
I gave you the little goat.


304
00:27:59.698 --> 00:28:02.899
- Well, Peter didn't believe me.
- 'Oh, no?'


305
00:28:02.901 --> 00:28:05.535
And you know
something even better?


306
00:28:05.537 --> 00:28:07.337
And just what is that?

307
00:28:07.339 --> 00:28:09.706
You're not using
your walking stick.


308
00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:11.975
Huh? My stick.

309
00:28:13.679 --> 00:28:17.247
I'll be<i>demnachst.</i>
<i>I'm well again!</i>


310
00:28:17.249 --> 00:28:20.550
We'll have a wonder fest.
A real celebration.


311
00:28:20.552 --> 00:28:22.552
This will be a day to remember.

312
00:28:22.554 --> 00:28:24.387
- Can Peter come?
- Yeah, yeah.


313
00:28:24.389 --> 00:28:26.556
- Spritz?
- Oh, yeah, everybody's invited.


314
00:28:26.558 --> 00:28:28.525
- Gruffle too?
- Even Gruffle.

330
00:30:05.357 --> 00:30:09.159
- Aunt Dete?
- Hello, Heidi.


331
00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:11.695
What do you want, woman?

332
00:30:11.697 --> 00:30:14.965
It's nice to see you, Aunt Dete.

333
00:30:14.967 --> 00:30:17.000
What's going on? I told you

334
00:30:17.002 --> 00:30:19.169
never to show your face
around here again.


335
00:30:19.171 --> 00:30:22.105
Well, that's not a warm greeting

336
00:30:22.107 --> 00:30:24.874
but at least
you didn't bellow and roar.


337
00:30:24.876 --> 00:30:26.710
I expect I will

338
00:30:26.712 --> 00:30:29.312
as soon as you tell me
what you've come for.


339
00:30:29.314 --> 00:30:32.983
I've come to take Heidi
to Frankfurt to live.


340
00:30:32.985 --> 00:30:36.353
- No.
- Woman, you're impossible.


341
00:30:36.355 --> 00:30:39.623
'First, you fling
the girl at me out of the blue'


342
00:30:39.625 --> 00:30:41.625
'and now you want to snatch her
away again.'


343
00:30:41.627 --> 00:30:43.226
Stubborn old man.

344
00:30:43.228 --> 00:30:46.463
You're determined
to muddle up my life.


345
00:30:46.465 --> 00:30:48.331
You're muddling up her life.

346
00:30:48.333 --> 00:30:51.167
I hear you haven't been
sending her to school.


347
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:53.036
'How do you expect her
to grow up?'


348
00:30:53.038 --> 00:30:55.705
I expect she'll grow up happy

349
00:30:55.707 --> 00:30:59.142
'with the birds and goats
and all the other animals.'


350
00:31:01.079 --> 00:31:03.146
'She won't learn bad things.'

351
00:31:03.148 --> 00:31:06.816
She'll learn nothing at all.
She can't grow up ignorant.


352
00:31:06.818 --> 00:31:09.486
And how do you intend
to make her wise?


353
00:31:09.488 --> 00:31:11.921
A very wealthy family
in Frankfurt


354
00:31:11.923 --> 00:31:13.923
has a young invalid daughter.

355
00:31:13.925 --> 00:31:15.825
They want a companion for her.

356
00:31:15.827 --> 00:31:19.529
They're looking for a simple,
unspoiled child like Heidi.


357
00:31:19.531 --> 00:31:21.264
I promised to bring her to them.

358
00:31:21.266 --> 00:31:24.267
You're selling the child
into slavery.


359
00:31:24.269 --> 00:31:26.202
- Hmph.
- I won't let you.


360
00:31:26.204 --> 00:31:30.006
Nonsense. She'll live
in a big, beautiful home


361
00:31:30.008 --> 00:31:32.876
and be treated
just like their own daughter.


362
00:31:32.878 --> 00:31:35.445
Treated like a sick child.

363
00:31:35.447 --> 00:31:37.347
She'll have fine things.

364
00:31:37.349 --> 00:31:39.716
I'd like something decent
for her.


365
00:31:43.088 --> 00:31:46.389
She's my sister's child, too,
you know?


366
00:31:56.435 --> 00:31:57.934
Ah.

367
00:31:59.571 --> 00:32:02.405
Take the child.
Go and be done with you.


368
00:32:02.407 --> 00:32:04.874
Never let me see you again
with your foolish hat


369
00:32:04.876 --> 00:32:08.478
and flopping feather
and flapping tongue.


370
00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:12.549
- You made grandfather angry.
- He's always been angry.


371
00:32:12.551 --> 00:32:15.318
Now, dear, be sure
to put on your best clothes.


372
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.921
If that foolish old man
hasn't burned them.


373
00:32:17.923 --> 00:32:20.824
- I don't want to go.
- It's a wonderful chance.


374
00:32:20.826 --> 00:32:23.993
You'll have all sorts of good
things you never dreamed off.


375
00:32:25.263 --> 00:32:28.331
You may become a real lady.

376
00:32:28.333 --> 00:32:31.267
I'm not going.
I love it here.


377
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:34.237
I love grandfather
and Spritz and everything.


378
00:32:36.808 --> 00:32:38.508
You heard what the old man said.

379
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:41.144
He doesn't want to see us
ever again.


380
00:32:41.146 --> 00:32:44.247
- He wants you to go with me.
- 'He was angry.'


381
00:32:44.249 --> 00:32:46.683
I don't think
he wants me to go away.


382
00:32:46.685 --> 00:32:49.819
He does.
And you should be glad.


383
00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:51.855
You'll love Frankfurt.

384
00:32:51.857 --> 00:32:55.825
Can I take Spritz? He's mine.

385
00:32:55.827 --> 00:32:57.427
'Of course not.'

386
00:32:57.429 --> 00:33:00.063
'They don't even allow creatures
like that in the city.'


387
00:33:15.547 --> 00:33:19.015
'Oh, hurry, child.
It's a long trip to Frankfurt.'


388
00:33:19.017 --> 00:33:21.718
Goodbye, grandfather.

389
00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.654
And get rid of that creature.

390
00:33:24.656 --> 00:33:27.690
Come on.
We've got to get started.


391
00:33:27.692 --> 00:33:30.794
You've caused me
enough time and trouble.


392
00:33:30.796 --> 00:33:32.562
I'm sorry, Spritz.

393
00:33:32.564 --> 00:33:36.232
I have to go a long way off
and you can't come.


394
00:33:36.234 --> 00:33:38.968
One day soon,
maybe I'll be back.


395
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:40.937
Go to Peter now.

'Goodbye.'

416
00:36:44.522 --> 00:36:48.091
Look, here we are, Heidi.
It will be a fine place to live.


417
00:36:48.093 --> 00:36:51.160
But, Aunt Dete,
it's so big and lonely.


418
00:36:51.162 --> 00:36:53.396
Nonsense.
You will be a companion


419
00:36:53.398 --> 00:36:56.032
to a very wealthy little girl.

420
00:36:56.034 --> 00:36:58.067
Come, come now and keep quiet.

421
00:36:58.069 --> 00:37:00.903
And stand up straight
and mind your manners.


422
00:37:00.905 --> 00:37:02.538
Now try to look pleasant

423
00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:04.874
and only speak
when you're spoken to.


424
00:37:08.747 --> 00:37:10.913
Yeah? What is it?

425
00:37:10.915 --> 00:37:15.351
This is the child, Heidi.
I was to bring her here.


426
00:37:15.353 --> 00:37:16.919
Yeah, I know.

427
00:37:16.921 --> 00:37:19.789
The little girl
we were expecting.


428
00:37:19.791 --> 00:37:22.291
'I will take her
to Fraulein Rottenmeier.'


429
00:37:28.099 --> 00:37:30.366
Wipe your feet good.

430
00:37:30.368 --> 00:37:31.868
Follow me.

431
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:35.905
Stay close and touch nothing.

432
00:37:35.907 --> 00:37:41.444
And when Fraulein Rottenmeier
speaks, you will listen.


433
00:37:41.446 --> 00:37:43.880
There will be no speaking back.

434
00:37:46.785 --> 00:37:49.118
H-hello, Fraulein Rottenmeier.

435
00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:53.489
Such a little stupid.
That is only a scullery maid.


436
00:37:53.491 --> 00:37:55.291
Come.

437
00:37:55.293 --> 00:37:57.960
I think you're a very nice
scullery maid.


438
00:37:57.962 --> 00:38:00.630
Oh, oh, thank you.

439
00:38:12.777 --> 00:38:14.844
And who is this?

440
00:38:16.681 --> 00:38:19.182
- I'm Heidi.
- This is the little girl who…


441
00:38:19.184 --> 00:38:23.820
No, no, no.
This is a terrible mistake.


442
00:38:23.822 --> 00:38:26.689
'She's just a drab
little nothing.'


443
00:38:26.691 --> 00:38:30.293
You are right as always,
Fraulein Rottenmeier.


444
00:38:30.295 --> 00:38:32.595
Oh, no, no, no, no.

445
00:38:32.597 --> 00:38:35.198
'She will never do
as a companion'

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.335

474
00:39:57.448 --> 00:40:00.616
See that she is shipped back
to the woods or mountains


475
00:40:00.618 --> 00:40:02.685
or wherever she came from.

476
00:40:02.687 --> 00:40:05.555
At once, fraulein.

477
00:40:05.557 --> 00:40:09.025
No, no, I don't want her to go.

478
00:40:09.027 --> 00:40:11.394
I want her to stay.

479
00:40:11.396 --> 00:40:13.896
Hello, my name is Klara.

480
00:40:13.898 --> 00:40:16.632
- I'm Heidi.
- I know, I heard.


481
00:40:16.634 --> 00:40:19.135
We're going to be good friends,
aren't we, Heidi?


482
00:40:19.137 --> 00:40:21.604
I don't think
your mother wants me to stay.


483
00:40:21.606 --> 00:40:23.439
Ha!

484
00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:25.641
'Fraulein Rottenmeier
isn't my mother.'


485
00:40:25.643 --> 00:40:28.644
'She's my governess
and the housekeeper.'


486
00:40:28.646 --> 00:40:31.547
My mother is dead

487
00:40:31.549 --> 00:40:35.451
and my father travels
on business most of the time.


488
00:40:35.453 --> 00:40:37.453
But he writes me every day.

489
00:40:37.455 --> 00:40:40.056
Really? I haven't learned
to write yet.


490
00:40:40.058 --> 00:40:43.593
Ha! You see?
She is a very stupid creature.


491
00:40:43.595 --> 00:40:47.096
Oh, no. I want her to stay.

492
00:40:47.098 --> 00:40:50.600
She's like a breath of fresh air
in this stuffy, old house.


493
00:40:50.602 --> 00:40:52.668
And I'll have someone
to talk to.


494
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:55.171
Ah, very well, she may stay.

495
00:40:55.173 --> 00:40:58.741
But when your father comes home,
there will be some changes.


496
00:40:58.743 --> 00:41:01.143
'Come, come, come, come,
Schnoodle<i>liebchen.'</i>


497
00:41:01.145 --> 00:41:04.747
Ugh, don't touch her.
She may be infested.


498
00:41:04.749 --> 00:41:06.616
- Tinette?
- Yes, ma'am.


499
00:41:06.618 --> 00:41:09.452
Take this urchin to her room.

500
00:41:09.454 --> 00:41:12.989
And make sure she is scrubbed
before she goes to bed.


501
00:41:12.991 --> 00:41:14.357
Yes, ma'am.

502
00:41:18.429 --> 00:41:20.129
'Oh, shut up.'

503
00:41:22.667 --> 00:41:25.134
I won't be able
to sleep in here ever.


504
00:41:25.136 --> 00:41:26.936
Why not, Heidi?

505
00:41:26.938 --> 00:41:29.672
I never slept in a bed
with a roof on it.


506
00:41:29.674 --> 00:41:31.774
Oh, those are just curtains.

507
00:41:31.776 --> 00:41:34.443
And you will be asleep
before you know it.


508
00:41:34.445 --> 00:41:36.279
I mean, it's so quiet.

509
00:41:36.281 --> 00:41:39.815
Don't you have any owls hooting
and goats bleating?


510
00:41:39.817 --> 00:41:42.151
Or even grandfather snoring?

511
00:41:42.153 --> 00:41:45.655
I know how you feel
being in a strange place.


512
00:41:45.657 --> 00:41:47.056
Now try to sleep.

513
00:41:47.058 --> 00:41:50.026
Maybe you can count sheep
jumping over a fence.


514
00:41:50.028 --> 00:41:51.894
'Will it be alright,
Tinette, if I counted'


515
00:41:51.896 --> 00:41:54.530
grandfather's goats
jumping over the rocks?


516
00:41:54.532 --> 00:41:57.333
Of course, goats are much nicer.

517
00:41:57.335 --> 00:41:59.502
What's the difference,
goats or sheep?


518
00:41:59.504 --> 00:42:01.237
They're all the same.

519
00:42:01.239 --> 00:42:03.339
Now close your eyes.

520
00:42:03.341 --> 00:42:05.508
Goodnight, Tinette.

521
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:07.310
Goodnight, Heidi.

522
00:42:12.383 --> 00:42:14.817
One, two..

523
00:42:18.356 --> 00:42:20.122
It's Great Turk.

524
00:42:21.926 --> 00:42:24.093
Oh, Glinfinch.

525
00:42:24.095 --> 00:42:26.729
Edelweiss.

526
00:42:26.731 --> 00:42:28.164
And Elsa.

527
00:42:28.166 --> 00:42:31.267
Oh, and little Spritz.

528
00:42:32.537 --> 00:42:35.171
You didn't forget me.

529
00:42:35.173 --> 00:42:37.440
Oh, Spritz?

530
00:42:37.442 --> 00:42:39.442
Oh, I've missed you!

531
00:42:39.444 --> 00:42:41.210
Oh!

532
00:43:06.404 --> 00:43:09.305
A storm
just like in the mountains.


533
00:43:11.576 --> 00:43:12.975
Good morning.

534
00:43:12.977 --> 00:43:15.578
Good morning.
I didn't see you.


535
00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.247
I'm Heidi. What's your name?

536
00:43:18.249 --> 00:43:19.749
My name is Willie.

537
00:43:19.751 --> 00:43:22.418
I'm delivering coal
to the Sessmans.


538
00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.554
- What do they do with coal?
- Everything.


539
00:43:25.556 --> 00:43:27.156
'You got to have coal.'

540
00:43:27.158 --> 00:43:30.192
'Without it, uh, Tinette
could not do the cooking.'


541
00:43:32.463 --> 00:43:34.163
Schnoodle?

542
00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.900
Now don't you bother Wolfgang.

543
00:43:39.804 --> 00:43:43.005
- Good morning, Willie.
- Uh, hello, Tinette.


544
00:43:44.008 --> 00:43:46.642
Well, I'm here again.

545
00:43:46.644 --> 00:43:48.744
- I can see.
- 'Yeah.'


546
00:43:48.746 --> 00:43:51.480
Uh, I'm delivering your coal.

547
00:43:51.482 --> 00:43:54.517
I heard.
Everyone in the house heard.


548
00:43:54.519 --> 00:43:57.453
- I heard too.
- Good morning, Heidi.


549
00:43:57.455 --> 00:44:00.356
Did you manage to count all
your goats and go to sleep?


550
00:44:00.358 --> 00:44:04.093
Oh, yes. They were
all here, every one of them.


551
00:44:04.095 --> 00:44:06.028
Even Spritz.

552
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:10.966
I go to sleep real easy.
I work hard all day.


553
00:44:10.968 --> 00:44:14.203
'Sometimes I go to sleep
in the middle of supper.'


554
00:44:23.214 --> 00:44:26.248
Schnoodle, are you teasing
Wolfgang again?


555
00:44:33.524 --> 00:44:36.125
You shouldn't work so hard,
Willie.


556
00:44:36.127 --> 00:44:38.828
Maybe take a walk through
the park in the evening.


557
00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:42.364
- Oh, I do that every night too.
- Oh?


558
00:44:42.366 --> 00:44:45.668
- Yeah, I walk with Gretchen.
- Gretchen?


559
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:49.305
Well, I hope you enjoy
your walks in the park.


560
00:44:51.642 --> 00:44:54.176
Dirty face. Oh!

561
00:44:55.546 --> 00:44:57.513
Now what did I say?

562
00:44:57.515 --> 00:44:59.815
She likes you.

563
00:44:59.817 --> 00:45:01.684
She likes me?

564
00:45:01.686 --> 00:45:03.652
She really does, I could tell.

565
00:45:03.654 --> 00:45:08.023
So I like her, too,
but does that make me mad?


566
00:45:08.025 --> 00:45:11.727
I think Tinette is jealous
of Gretchen.


567
00:45:11.729 --> 00:45:15.231
Gretchen? Gretchen's my horse.

568
00:45:15.233 --> 00:45:17.766
I only walk her through
the park to the stable.


569
00:45:17.768 --> 00:45:20.336
Why don't you ask Tinette
to walk with you sometime?


570
00:45:20.338 --> 00:45:22.438
Oh! Oh, oh, no.

571
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.508
No, I-I, no, I could
never ask Tinette.


572
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:29.411
I, oh, I, I couldn't think
of the right words to say.

597
00:48:35.132 --> 00:48:37.533
Oh, Mr. Sebastian,
where are we going?


598
00:48:37.535 --> 00:48:41.070
It is time for you to join
Miss Klara to keep her company.


599
00:48:41.072 --> 00:48:43.539
- How did Miss Klara get hurt?
- Hurt?


600
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:47.543
Yes. Why doesn't she walk?
Why is she in that wheelchair?


601
00:48:47.545 --> 00:48:49.378
She's just not well.

602
00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:52.381
And you must never speak of that
in this house.


603
00:48:52.383 --> 00:48:53.816
When will she get well?

604
00:48:53.818 --> 00:48:56.285
You must never speak
of that either.


605
00:48:58.255 --> 00:49:02.958
Oh, Heidi, the mountains must be
a beautiful place to live in.


606
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.827
Oh, yes, it was.

607
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:07.396
And I didn't even
have to wear shoes.


608
00:49:07.398 --> 00:49:09.498
And every day I would pick
beautiful flowers


609
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.100
for grandfather and..

610
00:49:11.102 --> 00:49:14.970
Oh, look, Klara, a little man.

611
00:49:14.972 --> 00:49:17.639
Oh, no, not a little man, Heidi.

612
00:49:17.641 --> 00:49:20.676
- A cute little monkey.
- How do you do?


613
00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:27.149
If you give him a penny,
he will dance for you.


614
00:49:27.151 --> 00:49:28.984
Is he your little boy?

615
00:49:28.986 --> 00:49:31.687
Oh, no.

616
00:49:31.689 --> 00:49:36.492
He's the world's famous dancing
monkey Flatterfoot Obis.


617
00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:43.198
Oh, Heidi, ask them
to come in, please.


618
00:49:43.200 --> 00:49:48.437
Oh, yes. Please, do come in.
I'd love to see him dance.


619
00:50:03.454 --> 00:50:08.190
Wonderful! Wonderful!
Oh, he's so cute!


620
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:13.562
When he dances,
he always gets a penny.


621
00:50:13.564 --> 00:50:15.798
Oh, of course.

622
00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:19.234
Here. Here,
all the pennies I have.


623
00:50:19.236 --> 00:50:21.804
Will you dance some more?

624
00:50:28.179 --> 00:50:31.380
Stop! What is going on here?

625
00:50:31.382 --> 00:50:34.349
And what is that ugly creature
doing in my house?


626
00:50:35.986 --> 00:50:38.720
Shoo! Shoo! Ooh, get away!

627
00:50:40.558 --> 00:50:45.027
Sebastian! Sebastian, get this
horrible creature out of here.


628
00:50:46.764 --> 00:50:49.198
Sebastian!

629
00:50:52.169 --> 00:50:53.936
You screamed?

630
00:50:53.938 --> 00:50:56.238
Oh, ah, ah, what was that?

631
00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:00.175
Ooh, get that wild beast out of
the house at once. Do you hear?


632
00:51:00.177 --> 00:51:03.846
Yeah, I hear. I hear.
I hear at once, I hear.


633
00:51:05.282 --> 00:51:08.684
Oh, Heidi, this is better
than a circus.


634
00:51:08.686 --> 00:51:11.053
I don't think
Fraulein Rottenmeier likes it.


635
00:51:12.289 --> 00:51:14.022
I'll get him, fraulein.

636
00:51:14.024 --> 00:51:16.124
I've got him. I've got him.

637
00:51:16.126 --> 00:51:17.459
Oh!

638
00:51:19.763 --> 00:51:21.396
Out! Out!

639
00:51:21.398 --> 00:51:22.798
Pennies. Pennies.

640
00:51:26.871 --> 00:51:28.437
Pennies. Pennies.

641
00:51:40.451 --> 00:51:42.985
- 'Ooh!'
- Pennies, pennies.


642
00:52:23.294 --> 00:52:25.694
Out! Out!

643
00:52:29.433 --> 00:52:32.434
And don't ever come back!

644
00:52:35.839 --> 00:52:37.339
Umph!

645
00:52:41.145 --> 00:52:44.479
Ooh, your father
will soon be home


646
00:52:44.481 --> 00:52:47.983
and when he sees the trouble
she has caused


647
00:52:47.985 --> 00:52:51.987
they'll send this stupid
little bumpkin packing.


648
00:52:51.989 --> 00:52:55.891
But, Fraulein Rottenmeier,
it's not Heidi's fault.


649
00:52:55.893 --> 00:52:59.061
Not Heidi's fault! Hmph!

650
00:52:59.063 --> 00:53:02.130
First bumpkins, then monkeys.

651
00:53:02.132 --> 00:53:04.333
She's a troublemaker.

652
00:53:13.677 --> 00:53:16.244
Do you really think
she'll send me away?


653
00:53:16.246 --> 00:53:19.715
Oh, Heidi, don't mind
Fraulein Rottenmeier.


654
00:53:19.717 --> 00:53:22.851
It was the animal.
She hates them.


655
00:53:22.853 --> 00:53:25.153
And I just love animals.

656
00:53:25.155 --> 00:53:28.023
I have lots of animal friends
on the Wunderhorn


657
00:53:28.025 --> 00:53:31.093
and my very own pet goat,
Spritz.


658
00:53:31.095 --> 00:53:33.195
I've always wanted a pet.

659
00:53:33.197 --> 00:53:35.764
Especially a little kitten.

660
00:53:35.766 --> 00:53:38.567
But Fraulein Rottenmeier
always says


661
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:43.071
"No, no, no animals
in my house!"


662
00:53:43.073 --> 00:53:45.607
Would you really like a kitten?

663
00:53:45.609 --> 00:53:48.343
'More than anything
in the world.'


664
00:54:09.233 --> 00:54:10.932
'Oh, good morning, Wolfgang.'

665
00:54:12.302 --> 00:54:15.437
Shh, don't make too much noise.

666
00:54:15.439 --> 00:54:18.106
I'm going out to get
a surprise for Klara.


667
00:54:18.108 --> 00:54:21.109
'We don't want anyone
to know about it, do we?'


668
00:54:21.111 --> 00:54:24.046
Bye-bye.
Don't forget your bone.


669
00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:19.034
Well, hello, Gretchen.

670
00:55:19.036 --> 00:55:22.104
Whoa, Gretchen.

671
00:55:22.106 --> 00:55:26.341
Heidi, what are you doing so far
from the Sessman's house?


672
00:55:26.343 --> 00:55:28.310
I was looking
for a kitten for Klara


673
00:55:28.312 --> 00:55:30.312
and it's going to be a surprise.

674
00:55:30.314 --> 00:55:33.849
Ah, the butcher's cat
just had kittens.


675
00:55:33.851 --> 00:55:37.552
- He'd probably give you one.
- How do I find the butcher?


676
00:55:37.554 --> 00:55:40.355
Come on, Gretchen and I
will take you there.


677
00:55:42.493 --> 00:55:46.728
Oh, Klara. Klara.
I have something for you.


678
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:49.664
- What is it?
- It's a surprise.


679
00:55:49.666 --> 00:55:52.033
Oh, I love surprises.

680
00:55:52.035 --> 00:55:56.471
Oh, Heidi, they're beautiful.

681
00:55:56.473 --> 00:55:59.875
'What sweet little things.
Oh, I love them.'


682
00:56:02.346 --> 00:56:06.047
'I couldn't decide which one
you'd like, so I took them all.'


683
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:08.016
'Look at that one, Heidi.'

684
00:56:08.018 --> 00:56:11.987
'You can hardly see it
like a gray fog.'


685
00:56:11.989 --> 00:56:13.989
'We'll call it Misty.'

686
00:56:13.991 --> 00:56:17.425
'And that one is like
a little golden cake.'


687
00:56:17.427 --> 00:56:19.227
Muffin.

688
00:56:19.229 --> 00:56:23.398
And look at this one.
It has to be called Snowball.


689
00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:27.702
It will be my favorite
because it chose me.


690
00:56:27.704 --> 00:56:30.739
'Oh, thank you, Heidi.
Thank you.'


691
00:56:30.741 --> 00:56:33.608
'Now I have pets
of my very own.'


692
00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:37.078
'And we'll keep
every one of them.'


693
00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.015
But what will
Fraulein Rottenmeier say?


694
00:56:40.017 --> 00:56:43.385
We'll have to hide them
very carefully from her.


695
00:56:43.387 --> 00:56:47.989
Isn't this fun?
We'll be leading secret lives.


696
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:31.399
What was that?

697
00:57:47.317 --> 00:57:49.651
You idiot!

698
00:57:49.653 --> 00:57:51.953
Oh, forgive me, fraulein.

699
00:57:53.323 --> 00:57:56.258
- What was that sound?
- It is nothing.


700
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:59.628
Only someone playing the piano.

701
00:57:59.630 --> 00:58:04.232
- At this time of night?
- I wonder if it could be a..


702
00:58:08.338 --> 00:58:11.139
Maybe a mouse?

703
00:58:11.141 --> 00:58:13.642
Don't ever do that again.

704
00:58:13.644 --> 00:58:16.878
- I didn't mean to.
- Shh! Quiet.


705
00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:20.115
Come. We'll go downstairs.

706
00:58:20.117 --> 00:58:25.053
You think a mouse could play
a piano like that?


707
00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:34.362
Oh, dear, this is terrible.
It must be the kittens.


708
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:08.830
It must be the ghost
of the Sessman house.


709
00:59:08.832 --> 00:59:13.034
'Yeah, fraulein.
It's definitely a<i>gepolter.'</i>


710
00:59:13.036 --> 00:59:16.171
'But there have never
been ghosts here before.'


711
00:59:16.173 --> 00:59:19.174
'Ah, up to now.'

712
00:59:19.176 --> 00:59:21.176
'It is ghost.'

713
00:59:50.474 --> 00:59:52.307
What was that?

714
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:56.077
You jellyfish,
find out what it is.


715
00:59:56.079 --> 01:00:02.317
It, it sounded like
it came from the b-b-ballroom.


716
01:00:02.319 --> 01:00:05.186
Then we look in the ballroom.

717
01:00:08.925 --> 01:00:11.059
There's nothing. See.

718
01:00:11.061 --> 01:00:13.661
But the piano was playing.

719
01:00:13.663 --> 01:00:16.331
It couldn't be, fraulein.

720
01:00:16.333 --> 01:00:20.668
You stupid,
ghosts can do anything.


721
01:00:20.670 --> 01:00:22.904
Go, look inside the piano.

722
01:00:22.906 --> 01:00:25.173
Go on, go on, see what it is.

723
01:00:25.175 --> 01:00:30.078
Stop pushing, stop pushing.
I'm looking as fast as I can.


724
01:00:34.751 --> 01:00:36.818
Is it a mouse?

725
01:00:38.188 --> 01:00:41.589
Not even a mouse. It's empty.

726
01:00:44.928 --> 01:00:49.097
Shh. Do you have to make
all that noise?


727
01:00:49.099 --> 01:00:51.499
Maybe the ghosts
have gone away now.


728
01:01:03.346 --> 01:01:05.313
It's a ghost!

729
01:01:10.053 --> 01:01:13.254
Help! Let me out of here!

730
01:01:14.224 --> 01:01:16.724
Don't leave me here!

731
01:01:29.906 --> 01:01:32.974
Goodness, they're gone.

732
01:01:32.976 --> 01:01:34.976
You naughty kittens.

733
01:01:39.216 --> 01:01:42.083
'It's true.
It's true, I tell you.'


734
01:01:42.085 --> 01:01:45.019
They have a ghost
and poltergeist


735
01:01:45.021 --> 01:01:47.489
all over the house last night.

736
01:01:47.491 --> 01:01:50.925
Ghosts? You-you saw them?

737
01:01:50.927 --> 01:01:53.061
'At first, we just heard them.'

738
01:01:53.063 --> 01:01:56.498
It was the kittens.
They got loose last night.


739
01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:00.034
Shh, don't say a word to anyone.

740
01:02:00.036 --> 01:02:03.171
And it was in this room
we saw the ghost.


741
01:02:03.173 --> 01:02:05.840
Over there by the piano.

742
01:02:05.842 --> 01:02:08.109
That was me
and two of the kittens.


743
01:02:08.111 --> 01:02:10.111
The curtain fell over our heads.

744
01:02:10.113 --> 01:02:12.113
What room is this?

745
01:02:12.115 --> 01:02:15.683
It is the ballroom.
People dance here.


746
01:02:15.685 --> 01:02:19.087
A room just for dancing?

747
01:02:19.089 --> 01:02:21.356
Would you like to dance, Klara?

748
01:02:21.358 --> 01:02:24.926
Oh, yes, and someday I will.

749
01:02:24.928 --> 01:02:28.229
I'll wear a beautiful
silken gown


750
01:02:28.231 --> 01:02:31.399
and look like a real princess.

Stop this nonsense immediately.

780
01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:34.615
And just what are you doing
in this room?


781
01:05:34.617 --> 01:05:37.785
Yeah, what are you doing
in this room?


782
01:05:37.787 --> 01:05:40.588
We were looking
for poltergeists.


783
01:05:40.590 --> 01:05:43.624
Yeah, fraulein, the ghosts.

784
01:05:43.626 --> 01:05:45.993
There are no ghosts
in the daytime.


785
01:05:45.995 --> 01:05:49.163
Tinette, get that
dust-covered wretch


786
01:05:49.165 --> 01:05:50.998
out of this house at once.

787
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.769
But Willie came to help
just in case we found a ghost.


788
01:05:54.771 --> 01:05:58.639
Ghosts! Don't you know
you could hurt yourself?


789
01:05:58.641 --> 01:06:02.677
Really, Fraulein Rottenmeier,
everything is alright.


790
01:06:02.679 --> 01:06:05.279
Everything is all wrong.

791
01:06:05.281 --> 01:06:07.982
It started when she arrived.

792
01:06:07.984 --> 01:06:10.752
She is a bad influence on you.

793
01:06:10.754 --> 01:06:13.855
Yeah, she is a bad one.

794
01:06:13.857 --> 01:06:16.824
I won't sleep another wink
in this house


795
01:06:16.826 --> 01:06:20.762
until you are gone
and things are back to normal.


796
01:06:21.831 --> 01:06:24.031
What was that?

797
01:06:24.033 --> 01:06:27.034
A cat!

798
01:06:27.036 --> 01:06:29.303
You stepped on Snowball.

799
01:06:29.305 --> 01:06:32.774
How did that dreadful creature
get in here?


800
01:06:32.776 --> 01:06:35.009
I got it for Klara.

801
01:06:35.011 --> 01:06:37.011
And some others too.

802
01:06:37.013 --> 01:06:40.681
You what?
You monstrous child!


803
01:06:40.683 --> 01:06:42.683
Get rid of them at once.

804
01:06:42.685 --> 01:06:45.987
But, fraulein,
I love those kittens


805
01:06:45.989 --> 01:06:49.357
and I'm going to ask father
to let me keep all of them.


806
01:06:49.359 --> 01:06:52.660
No! They cannot stay
in this house.


807
01:06:52.662 --> 01:06:54.996
They will give you the sniffles.

808
01:06:54.998 --> 01:07:00.001
'And, you,
you must be taught a lesson.'


809
01:07:00.003 --> 01:07:02.503
'Sebastian, take her away.'

810
01:07:02.505 --> 01:07:05.373
'Lock her in the cellar.'

811
01:07:05.375 --> 01:07:09.644
No! No!
You can't do that to Heidi.


812
01:07:11.548 --> 01:07:14.482
You like small animals,<i>ja?</i>

813
01:07:14.484 --> 01:07:18.085
In this cellar, you will find
rats to play with,<i>ja.</i>


814
01:07:18.087 --> 01:07:20.354
Lots of small animals.

815
01:07:20.356 --> 01:07:24.225
That is,
if they don't eat you first.


816
01:07:24.227 --> 01:07:27.728
You will stay here
until Herr Sessman comes.


817
01:07:27.730 --> 01:07:31.365
This cellar is a place
for troublemakers like you.


818
01:07:37.907 --> 01:07:41.108
- 'She's a zero.'
- 'Zero.'


819
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:44.779
- 'She's a nothing.'
- 'Nothing.'

Klara, you are not studying?

847
01:10:07.757 --> 01:10:12.593
How can I with Heidi locked away
in that horrible cellar?


848
01:10:12.595 --> 01:10:15.096
The girl needs discipline.

849
01:10:15.098 --> 01:10:18.599
She will stay locked up
until your father arrives


850
01:10:18.601 --> 01:10:21.068
to decide
what's to be done with her.


851
01:10:23.006 --> 01:10:27.575
All of this aggravation
has my head reeling.


852
01:10:27.577 --> 01:10:32.613
Oh, I have not slept at all
the last few nights.


853
01:10:32.615 --> 01:10:36.250
Ooh, that wretched Heidi. Oh!

854
01:11:55.832 --> 01:11:59.333
'I'll bet you wish
Heidi was back, Spritz.'


855
01:11:59.335 --> 01:12:03.270
You know something?
I wish she was back too.


856
01:12:03.272 --> 01:12:04.705
That old man is meaner

857
01:12:04.707 --> 01:12:07.475
and grouchier than ever
since she left.


858
01:12:07.477 --> 01:12:10.878
You there, boy, why are you
not tending to goats?


859
01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.881
Get back to work and don't
let me catch you


860
01:12:13.883 --> 01:12:17.485
lying around like this again
when I return from Dorfli.


861
01:12:17.487 --> 01:12:20.454
'Oh, it will go badly for you.'

862
01:12:20.456 --> 01:12:23.357
Who needs them, these children?

863
01:12:23.359 --> 01:12:25.626
Never a day's work out of them.

864
01:12:25.628 --> 01:12:29.663
'Lying around all the time,
playing, doing nothing. Aah!'


865
01:12:29.665 --> 01:12:32.566
Well, I guess
we can't get mad at him.


866
01:12:32.568 --> 01:12:34.702
He misses Heidi too.

867
01:12:35.571 --> 01:12:37.238
And look at old Gruffle.

868
01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.140
'Every day he watches the road'

869
01:12:39.142 --> 01:12:41.308
'waiting for Heidi
to come home.'


870
01:12:51.387 --> 01:12:53.387
Look, look, it's Hootie.

871
01:12:53.389 --> 01:12:55.923
He's come back.

872
01:12:55.925 --> 01:12:58.392
Come on, little Hoot.

873
01:12:58.394 --> 01:13:01.662
Come on, you can make it.
You can make it. Come on.


874
01:13:11.174 --> 01:13:13.607
I got him. I got him.

875
01:13:15.178 --> 01:13:18.245
I got him.

876
01:13:18.247 --> 01:13:19.580
Phew.

877
01:13:23.519 --> 01:13:25.853
What's the matter?
Is Heidi in trouble?


878
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:29.390
What kind of trouble?

879
01:13:31.093 --> 01:13:33.794
'Oh, no. That bad?'

880
01:13:33.796 --> 01:13:35.563
Heidi is in big trouble?

881
01:13:35.565 --> 01:13:37.765
That means
we have to go and help her.


882
01:13:39.235 --> 01:13:42.036
Do you hear that?
Do you hear that?


883
01:13:42.038 --> 01:13:44.705
We have to go to the city
and help Heidi.


884
01:13:44.707 --> 01:13:46.240
That's what
Hootie wants us to do.


885
01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:49.643
'What's the matter with you?'

886
01:13:49.645 --> 01:13:51.645
'Oh, I know you've never been
to the city before


887
01:13:51.647 --> 01:13:54.415
and you're afraid.
And so am I.


888
01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:55.983
But what about Heidi?

889
01:13:55.985 --> 01:13:59.153
She's our friend. She needs us.

We've gotta get out of here.


986
01:21:33.575 --> 01:21:36.176
We can't. The door is locked.

987
01:21:37.579 --> 01:21:39.780
Well, then we'll go out
the way we came in.


988
01:21:44.386 --> 01:21:47.087
I've got to say goodbye

991
01:22:39.908 --> 01:22:42.743
that Willie and Tinette
were going to the mountains?


992
01:22:42.745 --> 01:22:47.180
And what's more wonderful?
They said we could come along.


993
01:22:47.182 --> 01:22:49.483
Willie has been asking me
to go back with him


994
01:22:49.485 --> 01:22:52.452
and meet his family.
Haven't you, Willie?


995
01:22:52.454 --> 01:22:55.422
Yeah, and maybe
we'll be married.


996
01:22:55.424 --> 01:22:57.424
Oh, Willie.

997
01:22:57.426 --> 01:23:00.660
Are you sure your father
won't mind you going, Klara?


998
01:23:00.662 --> 01:23:03.130
Oh, no, no, not at all.

999
01:23:03.132 --> 01:23:04.965
You see, I left him a note

1000
01:23:04.967 --> 01:23:07.033
saying we were going
to the mountains.


1001
01:23:07.035 --> 01:23:12.272
'"Dear father, have
gone to see the mountains with Heidi.'


1002
01:23:12.274 --> 01:23:14.441
"Please don't worry.

1003
01:23:14.443 --> 01:23:18.145
"I'll be very careful
and I am sure


1004
01:23:18.147 --> 01:23:23.650
"Heidi's grandfather
will bring me back.


1005
01:23:23.652 --> 01:23:26.553
Your loving daughter, Klara."

1006
01:23:26.555 --> 01:23:29.289
What is the meaning of this?

1007
01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:31.291
Where has Klara gone?

1008
01:23:31.293 --> 01:23:34.294
Gone, Herr Sessman? Gone?

1009
01:23:34.296 --> 01:23:36.663
We didn't
even know they had left.


1010
01:23:36.665 --> 01:23:39.232
- Oh!
- Never mind!


1011
01:23:39.234 --> 01:23:41.568
I will take care
of you two later.


1012
01:23:46.141 --> 01:23:50.677
You know, I think
we better be gone before later.


1013
01:23:50.679 --> 01:23:55.048
You are right as always,
my dear Sebastian.


1014
01:23:55.050 --> 01:24:00.020
Huh? Yeah, yeah, now I'm right.

1015
01:24:00.022 --> 01:24:03.423
Okay, here's one suitcase
and another.


1016
01:24:03.425 --> 01:24:07.561
Don't forget the other one.
Don't scratch the handles.


1017
01:24:08.997 --> 01:24:12.199
Stand straight.
No fooling around.


1018
01:24:12.201 --> 01:24:15.101
Now we've got
the arrangement right.


1019
01:24:15.103 --> 01:24:18.338
There it is, Klara.
There is Wunderhorn.


1020
01:24:21.109 --> 01:24:24.044
Sorry, we can't go any further.

1021
01:24:24.046 --> 01:24:27.280
It's alright. Grandfather's
house is not far away.


1022
01:24:27.282 --> 01:24:29.349
Peter will push Klara up.

1023
01:24:29.351 --> 01:24:31.852
We will go
onto Willie's home now.


1024
01:24:31.854 --> 01:24:34.187
Heidi, come and visit
when you can.


1025
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:36.623
You will all be welcome anytime.

1026
01:24:36.625 --> 01:24:39.593
- Thank you, Tinette.
- And thank you both.


1027
01:24:39.595 --> 01:24:42.128
I never would have seen
these wonderful mountains


1028
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:43.396
without your help.

1029
01:24:43.398 --> 01:24:46.366
You're more than welcome,
Miss Klara.

done it my way.

Follow me, you hear?

Pick it up.'


1036
01:25:03.819 --> 01:25:05.919
Don't lag behind.

1037
01:25:05.921 --> 01:25:08.455
Faster, faster, faster.
Keep moving.


1038
01:25:08.457 --> 01:25:12.759
Will you listen to me?
I said go! Faster.


1039
01:25:12.761 --> 01:25:14.728
Oh, shut up!

1040
01:25:16.064 --> 01:25:18.098
Why don't you go on ahead?

1041
01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:22.235
Oh, yes.
He'll be so surprised.


1042
01:25:22.237 --> 01:25:23.970
Or grouchy.

1043
01:25:23.972 --> 01:25:25.605
Come on, we'll run to the house

1044
01:25:25.607 --> 01:25:28.341
and tell grandfather
about Klara.


1045
01:25:28.343 --> 01:25:30.243
Uh, how about you?

1046
01:25:30.245 --> 01:25:33.980
I'll be just fine.
You go on ahead, too, Peter.


1047
01:25:33.982 --> 01:25:37.584
Yeah, I wanna see his face
when she tells him about you.


1048
01:25:43.792 --> 01:25:46.626
Oh, Snowball,
isn't it beautiful?


1049
01:25:46.628 --> 01:25:49.996
I know, you'd like to get down
and play, wouldn't you?


1050
01:25:49.998 --> 01:25:52.032
Alright, off you go.

1051
01:25:52.034 --> 01:25:54.034
'But not too far, mind you.'

1052
01:26:00.042 --> 01:26:04.711
'Snowball, not so close
to the edge. Come here now.'


1053

Run, Snowball.

1065
01:27:00.235 --> 01:27:02.335
Snowball!

1066
01:27:35.871 --> 01:27:38.371
