1
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.667
What day is it?

2
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.628
I don't have a clue.

3
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.822
Time never used to go by this way...

4
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.704
As a child,
you felt things differently.


5
00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.662
Everything lasted so marvelously long!

6
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.389
But now...

7
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.542
I don 't sleep much anymore.

8
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.540
As soon as I fall into a dream,
I wake up with a start.


9
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.462
As if every sleep
was a "little death ".

10
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.820
You can do it!

11
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.028
Don't think about it, just do it!

12
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.509
T ake a deep breath...

13
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.900
And then jump!

14
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.339
One...

15
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.059
two...

16
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.021
and three!

17
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.309
It worked Iast time.

18
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.109
You're lucky
ifyou learned to swim as a kid.


19
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.306
It'll spare you some embarrassment.

20
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.302
My Mom's fault!

21
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.548
She was afraid of water.

22
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.746
So I was, too...

23
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.259
Never was a problem then. 
But now it is.

24
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.348
How's it going, boys?

25
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.020
This one is coming along.

26
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.706
In the foreground, 
Ieft and right,

27
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.542
we added a couple of buildings.

28
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.746
It makes it more dense.

29
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.825
Back here
we added some more floors.


30
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.749
Here, too.

31
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.665
And the horizon is more distant

32
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.027
and more multi-Iayered.
We've selected a couple of skies, too.


33
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.265
No, I have another idea for the sky.

34
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.141
Somehow...

35
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.939
time has to come into play here.

36
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.389
We'II put the sunrise from
the first series on the Ieft.


37
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.506
The Arizona clouds in the middle

38
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.230
and on the right,
the sunset we put aside once.


39
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.187
From Western Australia?

40
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.144
That one. Exactly.

41
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.460
Pay attention to all the details.

42
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.829
The balcony glass
has to reflect the morning sun.


43
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.981
And the pool should reflect the clouds.

44
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.741
Easy.

45
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.103
But here's the best part:

46
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.142
From here on,
right down into the city,


47
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.141
it should gradually turn to night.

48
00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.302
You can stay in the house, Frances,

49
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.938
but not forever.
We never agreed on that.


50
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.427
You were the one who suggested it!

51
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.140
You can'tjust throw me out!

52
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.144
I have as much right
to it as you do!

53
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.665
It's not my problem any more.

54
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:58.104
That's what Iawyers are for.
Good night.


55
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.980
Frances is driving me crazy.

56
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.386
Don't get drawn into it!

57
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:10.824
Don't be so nice.

58
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.629
It won't work with her.

59
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:16.021
Throw her out, cut off her money!
She is such a bitch!


60
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.908
That won't make it better.

61
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.740
It's me. So?

62
00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.345
Are you ready?

63
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.582
I can't tonight, Sylvie.
We'II have to postpone.


64
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:28.464
I have to work all night.

65
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.339
I know.

66
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.149
I'm really sorry.

67
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.029
I was Iooking forward to seeing you.

68
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:42.186
It's been like that for a while.
You don't give a shit any more.


69
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:45.506
We'II spend
a great week-end together soon.


70
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.865
- When would that be?
- It's a promise. Don't be angry.


71
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:51.467
I think of you. Bye!

72
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.223
Who was that?

73
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.183
Duisburg.

74
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.747
Come, Iet's mingle with the crowd!

75
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:09.145
We need to talk
about tenants for your "Cube."


76
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.143
You can't Ieave it empty so Iong.

77
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:14.301
Three galleries have called.

78
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:16.745
By the way...

79
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.549
I changed the code to 4712.

80
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:21.506
You idiot.

81
00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.626
In case you need the office again...

82
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:31.102
It's not cool
that you Iive in the place yourself now.


83
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:33.500
It won't be for Iong.
I can't sleep anyway.


84
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.705
You should try it.

85
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:36.940
It feels Iike Iost time.

86
00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:12.822
How often do I stand here
and look down at the river?


87
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.426
Yesterday, day before yesterday,
today, tomorrow,


88
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.787
all like and the same endless day!

89
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.509
Money's growing on trees again.

90
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.423
Photography's booming.
But you have to be careful.


91
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.787
The fashion shoots will ruin
your standing with the museums.


92
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:30.225
- Did Harry tell you that?
- No. I am telling you.


93
00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:38.065
Julian, you're up early.

94
00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:40.741
We'II say hi to Milla.

95
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.547
UFOs farther Ieft!

96
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.580
Come forward, Mars man!

97
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.183
Hans! Go tell him!

98
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.988
Don't just stand around!

99
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.658
The whole boat! More dynamic!

100
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:34.979
Stay out of this!

101
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.465
Water, water.

102
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.223
Reflector up!

103
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.429
When should we do it?

104
00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:28.985
No, today is bad.

105
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:33.625
Hand off the support, please!

106
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:35.699
It'II have to do!

107
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.860
Don't forget
that you're still in the frame!


108
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:44.820
Steelworker, come closer.

109
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:47.383
Keep it quiet!

110
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.622
You're not the only ones
who want to go home, yeah?


111
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.349
So you think
I should work on it even more?


112
00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:21.422
Exactly.
Then it might become a real image.


113
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.301
That's enough about ourphotos,
and your opinions of them.


114
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.144
Now it's my turn.

115
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.699
I want to tell you
what bothers me about your work.


116
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.823
Fire away.

117
00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.420
You found my picture so "empty."

118
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.184
I'd Iike to know what you feel
is "under the surface" here.


119
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:45.103
Nothing.
Things are nothing but surface.


120
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.027
It's not hard to understand.

121
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:57.348
If there's nothing to unveil,
we don't need to photograph!


122
00:14:57.510 --> 00:14:58.829
We don't need to do a thing.

123
00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.423
We may as well just get drunk
and wait for our retirement.


124
00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.909
Or better yet, just die.

125
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:09.861
This is still too sharp.

126
00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.387
Sao Paolo is hazier.

127
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.666
We haven't adjusted the contrast yet.

128
00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:16.149
Get a move on!

129
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.463
Can I take a picture of us?

130
00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:37.622
Can I have an autograph?

131
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.629
What's your name?

132
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:08.266
I could be dead now.

133
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:10.422
But I'm not.

134
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.388
I could feel twice as alive.

135
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.949
But I don't.

136
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:26.622
I have such a yarning
for things to change!


137
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:30.701
Everything, if you ask me...

138
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:22.465
How do you know you're dead?

139
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.541
When you don 't dream any more?

140
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.026
Or when all you do is dream?

141
00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:36.503
Lovely, isn't it?

142
00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:40.905
The Rhine.

143
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:42.305
The meadows.

144
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.019
The morning.

145
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:49.948
Are those your sheep?

146
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:53.700
These? Oh no.
I am only a temporary keeper.


147
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:54.746
And the old man?

148
00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:56.104
Did he stop?

149
00:22:56.670 --> 00:22:58.626
He's sleeping it off...

150
00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:01.186
And I pay him well for it.

151
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:02.949
You pay to do his work?

152
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.781
Of course.

153
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.146
I'm an early riser anyway.

154
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.303
The Tokyo stock exchange!

155
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:10.703
The dog does all the work.

156
00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.826
I just walk along.

157
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.463
Why do you do it?

158
00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.589
Shepherding...

159
00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.908
For the peace of mind, or what?

160
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:31.267
I enjoy howtime passes.

161
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:33.989
And how does it pass?

162
00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.265
SIowly!

163
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.103
Very slowly...

164
00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:45.462
It all depends on how much time
you give yourself to sense time.


165
00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:48.782
I tell you,
we can slow time down.


166
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.785
Time doesn't care about us.

167
00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.461
Look at my tree.

168
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.146
I've known it since I was five.

169
00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:02.027
How can you slow it down?

170
00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.659
Don't you ever imagine things

171
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:13.661
that you believe
will happen again?


172
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:29.664
I don't want to be nosey,

173
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:34.187
but have you ever
Iost someone close to you?


174
00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:39.739
My mother.

175
00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.623
I'm sorry.

176
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:49.189
Your mother...

177
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:55.903
"Palermo."

178
00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.782
It comes from Greek.

179
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:01.987
It was originally called "Panormos."

180
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.545
"Great harbor."

181
00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:15.421
Did you ever imagine
how it was for your mother


182
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:17.421
to see her house for the Iast time?

183
00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.710
Her Iast time at the hairdresser?

184
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:24.542
There is always a Iast time, eventually.

185
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.302
But we don't usually know.

186
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:30.909
So you need to do everything
as though it were the Iast time.


187
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:36.301
My Iast morning with the sheep.

188
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.030
The Iast stranger I Iook in the eye.

189
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.905
Your tear just now,
the Iast I'II ever see.


190
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:46.186
You have to take everything
dead seriously.


191
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.148
Just not yourself!

192
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.903
Take care!

193
00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:01.620
Of course Milla will come.
She wanted it!


194
00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.348
You have to tell her right away.

195
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:07.059
How can we organize it so fast?
Do you want to take the whole team?


196
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:10.506
No, no big team.
An assistant, make-up, stylist.


197
00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.184
- How can I get you all on a flight?
- Harry's plane.


198
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.581
- Ask him to Ioan it to us for a day.
- I'm not sure we can.


199
00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:20.348
Harry shares the plane.
Does it have to be now?


200
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:22.341
Yes. This afternoon... to Palermo.

201
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.306
Palermo?

202
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:25.904
Giovanni has all the connections.
Let him organize it.


203
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:27.788
Any idea where you want
to do the shoot?


204
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:31.226
No, I was never there.
I'm just checking some pictures.


205
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:39.508
What's missing?

206
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:43.148
What's missing in my life is...

207
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:46.867
What is missing, anyway?

208
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:49.863
Pack everything up
and fly back as soon as you can.


209
00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:12.506
"23 calls in your absence"

210
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.823
When was I really present lately?

211
00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.022
Actually "there"?

212
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.947
Take it from me:.

213
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:15.305
it's a shitty feeling when
everything falls apart all of a sudden.


214
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.744
Don't move.

215
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:57.425
Do you mind if...

216
00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:00.748
...if I finish my drawing?

217
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:22.020
German?

218
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:31.941
"Little Hans went alone..."

219
00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:42.625
Julian! How's it going?

220
00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:44.741
Good. You on vacation?

221
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:47.580
The new photos ofMilla are great!

222
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:50.423
They bought them, but did you
need to go all the way to Palermo?


223
00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:51.909
I think we did.

224
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:54.029
When are you coming back?

225
00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:55.739
Don't know yet.

226
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:59.019
It's the right place right now.

227
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:04.067
Do you know what Palermo means?

228
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:05.219
No idea.

229
00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:08.100
- The Mafia Capital?
- Very funny.


230
00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:12.022
It means "big harbor",
mother of all harbors.


231
00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:14.824
Call if you need anything.

232
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:17.339
See you.
