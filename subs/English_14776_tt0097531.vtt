1
00:00:01.091 --> 00:00:03.634
What is concerning them
is that the nation


2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.580
appears to be getting
worried about its health.


3
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.458
And that is what's worrying Best Co,

4
00:00:09.558 --> 00:00:13.337
because Best Co wants to go on
selling them what it always has,


5
00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:18.717
ie, white breads,
baked beans, canned foods


6
00:00:18.817 --> 00:00:22.221
and that suppurating,
fat-squirting little heart attack


7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:25.974
traditionally known
as the British sausage.


8
00:00:26.074 --> 00:00:29.728
So, how can we help them with that?

9
00:00:29.828 --> 00:00:33.440
Clearly, we are looking for a label.

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.193
We need a label brimming with health.

11
00:00:36.293 --> 00:00:39.738
And everything from a nosh pot
to a white sliced


12
00:00:39.838 --> 00:00:42.491
will wear one with pride.

13
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:45.828
And although I'm aware of the difficulties
of coming to terms with this,


14
00:00:45.928 --> 00:00:49.289
it must be appreciated
from the beginning


15
00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:52.876
that even the nosh pot
must be low in something.


16
00:00:52.976 --> 00:00:56.213
And if it isn't, it must be
high in something else.


17
00:00:56.313 --> 00:01:02.026
And that is its health-giving
ingredient we will sell.


18
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.138
Which brings me to my final question.

19
00:01:05.238 --> 00:01:07.683
Who are we trying to sell this to?

20
00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:10.018
Answer, we are trying to sell this

21
00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:12.938
to the archetypal, average housewife,

22
00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:15.498
she who fills her basket.

23
00:01:16.124 --> 00:01:20.070
What you have here
is a 22-year-old pretty girl.


24
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.614
What you need is a taut slob,

25
00:01:22.714 --> 00:01:26.201
something on foot deodorisers
in a brassiÃ¨re.


26
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:29.037
MAN: I... I'm not quite sure
we can go along with that, Mr Bagley.


27
00:01:29.137 --> 00:01:30.789
If you look at the market research...

28
00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:33.250
I don't need to look
at the market research.


29
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.253
I've lived with 13 and a half
million housewives for 15 years.


30
00:01:36.353 --> 00:01:39.673
I know everything about them.
She's 37 years old.


31
00:01:39.773 --> 00:01:43.176
She has 2.3 children,

32
00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:46.597
She uses 16 feet six inches
of toilet tissue a week


33
00:01:46.697 --> 00:01:49.141
and fucks no more
than 4.2 times a month.


34
00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:52.477
She has seven radiators
and is worried about her weight,


35
00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:54.521
which is why we
have her on a diet.

36
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:56.023
And because we have her on a diet,

37
00:01:56.123 --> 00:01:59.443
we also encourage her
to reward herself with little treats,


38
00:01:59.543 --> 00:02:00.944
and she deserves them.

39
00:02:01.044 --> 00:02:03.697
Because anyone existing
on 1,200 calories


40
00:02:03.797 --> 00:02:06.909
of artificial, synthetic,
orange-flavoured waffle a day


41
00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.661
deserves a little treat.

42
00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:12.164
"We know it's naughty,
but you do deserve it.


43
00:02:12.264 --> 00:02:14.499
"Go on, darling, swallow a bun."

44
00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.792
And she does.

45
00:02:15.892 --> 00:02:18.712
And the instant she does,
the guilt cuts in.


46
00:02:18.812 --> 00:02:21.548
So here we are again with our diet.

47
00:02:21.648 --> 00:02:24.217
It's a vicious,
but quite wonderful circle,


48
00:02:24.317 --> 00:02:27.095
and it adheres to only one rule.

49
00:02:27.195 --> 00:02:29.431
"Whatever it is, sell it."

50
00:02:29.531 --> 00:02:33.284
If you want to stay in advertising,
by God, you'd better learn that.


51
00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:40.233
Bagley. Look, it's not in my nature to be
a pain in the arse with such consistency.


52
00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.527
It's being forced on me.
I just had them on the phone.


53
00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:44.988
They are phoning me back.
I've got to give them something.


54
00:02:45.088 --> 00:02:47.407
- Tell them it'll be wonderful. Hi, Harry.
- All right?


55
00:02:47.507 --> 00:02:48.909
I did. They're over the moon.

56
00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.621
Apart from 15 calls a day wondering where
the fuck it is, they couldn't be happier.


57
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:55.791
They're getting impatient. We promised
them the animatic over a week ago.


58
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:58.418
I'll be frank with you, Bagley.
I'm running out of bullshit.


59
00:02:58.518 --> 00:03:01.463
- Try massaging your temples.
- I've got to give them a date.


60
00:03:01.563 --> 00:03:04.508
Either a date or you give me some idea
of what you're coming up with.


61
00:03:04.608 --> 00:03:07.761
I'm coming up with a brilliant advertisement
for a very dull pimple cream.


62
00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:11.139
Then why can't I take a look?
Why can't I see something?


63
00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.058
You know, just a storyboard
or some roughs,


64
00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:16.061
anything so as I can give them
an idea of the direction you're going in.


65
00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:17.771
No. I don't show work in progress.

66
00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:19.982
- Any calls?
- Mr Bristol called again, twice.


67
00:03:20.082 --> 00:03:22.651
- I hope you told him I was out.
- Yes, Mr Bagley. You were out.


68
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:26.738
- Good. If he calls again, I'm still out.
- Bagley, you have got to give me a date.


69
00:03:26.838 --> 00:03:29.658
All right, try Monday on him.
And don't get so panicky.


70
00:03:29.758 --> 00:03:34.178
Nobody ever remembers a late delivery,
Richard. They only remember a bad one.


71
00:03:36.932 --> 00:03:41.044
Boil busters. The boil busters.

72
00:03:41.144 --> 00:03:44.214
Your face can be a battleground.

73
00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:47.009
You need something tough.

74
00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.110

BAGLEY: What do they want
another pimple cream for?


77
00:04:02.958 --> 00:04:04.484
The market's saturated.

out there, Bagley.

- Tell him I'm out again.
- He says he knows you're not.


98

He says he knows you're avoiding him
and he says he insists on a time to see you.

Oh, for Christ's sake, give me a break.

- No idea. It's probably junk.

If you knew it actually got rid of boils,
you'd have no problem selling it.

00:08:02.989 --> 00:08:06.059
Well, I really do think you should
cancel Bristol and come home with me.


152
00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:10.522
I can't. I've been cancelling him all week.
Why can't we cancel this dinner?


153
00:08:10.622 --> 00:08:12.148
I'm not in the mood for that mob.

154
00:08:12.248 --> 00:08:15.277
If I had known we were having dinner,
I'd never have suggested lunch.


155
00:08:15.377 --> 00:08:17.696
We can have both. 
People do, darling.

156
00:08:17.796 --> 00:08:21.574
- I suppose Wheelstock will be there.
- Don't take it out on Penny.


157
00:08:21.674 --> 00:08:23.034
Christ, what am I going to do?

158
00:08:23.134 --> 00:08:25.870
Dennis, for goodness' sake,
stop getting so paranoid.


159
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:30.041
Everything will be all right. You've had
these sort of problems many times before.


160
00:08:30.141 --> 00:08:32.043
- Not like this, I haven't.
- Oh, yes you have.


161
00:08:32.143 --> 00:08:34.045
You had a terrible time with piles.

162
00:08:34.145 --> 00:08:36.673
I did not have
a terrible time with piles.


163
00:08:36.773 --> 00:08:38.967
I may have had a problem
getting ahold of them,


164
00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:41.886
- but selling them was a piece of cake.
- You're raising your voice.


165
00:08:41.986 --> 00:08:44.472
Compared to this,
piles were a birthday present.


166
00:08:44.572 --> 00:08:48.310
- So was dandruff. So was breath.
- You're still raising your voice.


167
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.813
The whole lot taken together,
including the fucking lawnmowers,


168
00:08:51.913 --> 00:08:55.541
is as nothing compared
to the pimples, acne and boils!


169
00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:01.489
BAGLEY:
I don't want to go back in there.


170
00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:03.950
JULIA: Don't worry about it.
Don't think about boils.


171
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:07.162
If a boil pops up, force yourself
to think of something else.


172
00:09:07.262 --> 00:09:09.956
- BAGLEY: OK.
- JULIA: And don't go near your office.


173
00:09:10.056 --> 00:09:12.266
Just see Bristol and come home.

174
00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:21.733
- Are you sure you can't wait for me?
- Sorry, I can't, darling.


175
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.219
(LIFT BEEPS)

176
00:09:56.478 --> 00:09:59.422
Get Bristol on the line and
tell him I'm coming in to see him now.


177
00:09:59.522 --> 00:10:02.733
- (SQUEAKING)
- MAN: Yeah. Have him call me later.


178
00:10:03.735 --> 00:10:06.805
Sorry to keep you waiting, Bagley.
I didn't expect you till four o'clock.


179
00:10:06.905 --> 00:10:09.057
- Here, take a look at this.
- What is it?


180
00:10:09.157 --> 00:10:12.435
It's a photostat of an arse
from a copying machine.


181
00:10:12.535 --> 00:10:15.537
- Don't recognise it, do you?
- Not offhand, no.


182
00:10:16.122 --> 00:10:19.109
You gave the juniors
a bit of a tongue-lashing yesterday.


183
00:10:19.209 --> 00:10:21.194
- Really?
- Said you went over the top.


184
00:10:21.294 --> 00:10:24.322
I haven't got time
to give lessons in advertising.


185
00:10:24.422 --> 00:10:26.366
They asked my opinion, and I gave it.

186
00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:29.369
In my opinion,
they'd completely missed the brief.


187
00:10:29.469 --> 00:10:31.913
I think you're probably right.
Not now, Sheila.


188
00:10:32.013 --> 00:10:35.792
As a matter of fact, I think you
helped them out. About 15 minutes.


189
00:10:35.892 --> 00:10:39.394
Anyway. That's not actually
what I wanted to talk about.


190
00:10:40.104 --> 00:10:43.341
How are we getting on
with the pimple cream?


191
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:45.093
Five minutes.

192
00:10:45.193 --> 00:10:47.804
Is it special? 555-0472.

193
00:10:47.904 --> 00:10:50.348
- Sensational.
- Can you give me a verbal peek?


194
00:10:50.448 --> 00:10:53.017
- You know me, John. I'd rather not.
- That's what I thought.


195
00:10:53.117 --> 00:10:56.020
No, Los Angeles 555-0472.

196
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.773
I'm very pleased to hear it,
because I'll tell you frankly,


197
00:10:58.873 --> 00:11:01.818
they were on the phone this morning,
threatening to pull the account.


198
00:11:01.918 --> 00:11:03.945
Anyone but you and they would.

199
00:11:04.045 --> 00:11:08.074
It's finished. Just a fine-tune.
I'll be through over the weekend.


200
00:11:08.174 --> 00:11:09.909
Can we diarise on that?

201
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:13.413
- Of course.
- Wonderful. Wonderful.


202
00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:15.874
Yes. Put him through.

203
00:11:15.974 --> 00:11:19.043
Mmm? Mm-hm.

204
00:11:19.143 --> 00:11:21.436
Really? Why so fast?

205
00:11:22.939 --> 00:11:24.940
Really?

206
00:11:25.483 --> 00:11:29.971
What happened to Seymour,
Hickwash, Bone, Riddle and Gore?


207
00:11:30.071 --> 00:11:32.155
Really? (CHUCKLES)

208
00:11:33.283 --> 00:11:36.060
What about OCDS? (LAUGHS)

209
00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.980
Wh... Is it a kipper?

210
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.734
Oh, that's interesting.
What a complete range of dinners.


211
00:11:42.834 --> 00:11:45.528
Frozen kippers...
Just hang on a second, Bagley.


212
00:11:45.628 --> 00:11:47.822
No. He's here now. I'll ask him.

213
00:11:47.922 --> 00:11:51.367
No, no, he's finished.
He'll be through Monday, for sure.


214
00:11:51.467 --> 00:11:53.703
Hang on a sec, Eddie.

215
00:11:53.803 --> 00:11:57.415
Can you handle a Monday pitch?
It's a quickie. You'd have to go in dry.


216
00:11:57.515 --> 00:11:59.850
- What's the product?
- It's a boil-in-a-bag.


217
00:12:01.978 --> 00:12:04.130
- You all right. Bagley?
- Yes, I'm fine.


218
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.858
Tell him OK. I'll be in
first thing Monday morning.


219
00:12:11.029 --> 00:12:13.431
JULIA: You must stop worrying.

220
00:12:13.531 --> 00:12:17.769
If a boil pops up, force yourself
to think of something else.


221
00:12:17.869 --> 00:12:19.312
BAGLEY: You're absolutely right.

222
00:12:19.412 --> 00:12:21.856
I'm absolutely not
gonna think about boils,


223
00:12:21.956 --> 00:12:26.611
large boils, blind boils or fat girls' boils,
till ten o'clock tomorrow morning.


224
00:12:26.711 --> 00:12:32.507
What about large, blind,
fat girls with boils?


225
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.215
I see the police have made
another lightning raid.


226
00:12:47.315 --> 00:12:49.342
- Paddington drug orgy.
- Huh.


227
00:12:49.442 --> 00:12:51.928
(IRISH ACCENT) I suppose
young girls was involved?


228
00:12:52.028 --> 00:12:54.889
"One discovered naked in the kitchen,

229
00:12:54.989 --> 00:12:57.058
"breasts smeared with peanut butter.

230
00:12:57.158 --> 00:13:02.272
"The police took away a bag containing

231
00:13:02.372 --> 00:13:06.109
"It may also contain
a quantity of heroin."


232
00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:08.570
BAGLEY: Or a pork pie.

233
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.238
I beg your pardon?

234
00:13:10.338 --> 00:13:14.299
I said, the bag may also
have contained a pork pie.


235
00:13:15.301 --> 00:13:17.662
I hardly see a pork pie's
got anything to do with it.


236
00:13:17.762 --> 00:13:21.207
All right, then,
what about a large turnip?


237
00:13:21.307 --> 00:13:23.626
It may also have contained a big turnip.

238
00:13:23.726 --> 00:13:26.337
- The bag was full of drugs.
- Nonsense.


239
00:13:26.437 --> 00:13:28.631
The bag was full
of drugs! It says so!

240
00:13:28.731 --> 00:13:30.842
The bag could have been
full of anything.


241
00:13:30.942 --> 00:13:33.469
Pork pies, turnips, oven parts.

242
00:13:33.569 --> 00:13:35.847
- It's the oldest trick in the book.
- What book?


243
00:13:35.947 --> 00:13:38.725
The distortion of truth
by association book.


244
00:13:38.825 --> 00:13:40.518
The word is "may".

245
00:13:40.618 --> 00:13:44.522
You all believe heroin was in the bag
because cannabis resin was in the bag.


246
00:13:44.622 --> 00:13:46.691
The bag may have contained heroin,

247
00:13:46.791 --> 00:13:49.068
but the chances are 100 to one
certain that it didn't.


248
00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:51.237
Lot more likely than what you say.

249
00:13:51.337 --> 00:13:53.781
About as likely
as the tits spread with peanut butter.


250
00:13:53.881 --> 00:13:56.367
- Do you mind?
- The tits were spread with peanut butter!


251
00:13:56.467 --> 00:13:57.910
- BAGLEY: Nonsense.
- It says so!


252
00:13:58.010 --> 00:14:00.747
Who's the man you are to think
you know more about it than the press?


253
00:14:00.847 --> 00:14:04.709
I'm an expert on tits.
Tits and peanut butter.


254
00:14:04.809 --> 00:14:06.878
I'm also an expert drug pusher.

255
00:14:06.978 --> 00:14:10.298
- I've been pushing drugs for 20 years.
- Look here, I've had enough of this!


256
00:14:10.398 --> 00:14:13.343
And I can tell you,
a pusher protects his pitch.


257
00:14:13.443 --> 00:14:16.387
We wanna sell 'em cigarettes
and don't like competition, see?


258
00:14:16.487 --> 00:14:19.307
So we associate
a relatively innocuous drug


259
00:14:19.407 --> 00:14:21.267
with one that is extremely dangerous.

260
00:14:21.367 --> 00:14:24.604
And the rags go along with it because
they adore the dough from the ads.


261
00:14:24.704 --> 00:14:26.981
I've had enough of this.
I'm getting off at Thatchet.


262
00:14:27.081 --> 00:14:29.859
Getting off at Thatchet won't help you.
Getting off anywhere won't.


263
00:14:29.959 --> 00:14:32.695
I've had an octopus squatting
on my brain for a fortnight,


264
00:14:32.795 --> 00:14:35.198
and I suddenly see that
I am the only one that can help you.


265
00:14:35.298 --> 00:14:37.283
It would be pointless
to go into the reasons why,


266
00:14:37.383 --> 00:14:39.827
but I've been worried sick
about boils for a fortnight.


267
00:14:39.927 --> 00:14:43.581
Large boils, small boils, fast eruptors.
They're incurable, all of them.


268
00:14:43.681 --> 00:14:45.375
I know that, and so does everybody else.

269
00:14:45.475 --> 00:14:47.877
Until they get one.
Then the rules suddenly change.


270
00:14:47.977 --> 00:14:50.838
With a boil on the nose,
there's a sudden overnight surge in faith.


271
00:14:50.938 --> 00:14:52.757
They wanna believe something will work.

272
00:14:52.857 --> 00:14:55.885
He knows that, which is why
he gets a good look in with the dying.


273
00:14:55.985 --> 00:14:57.762
Sell some hope, you see?

274
00:14:57.862 --> 00:14:59.972
But these boys would be full-time
into real estate


275
00:15:00.072 --> 00:15:02.157
if anyone came up
with a genuine cure for death!


276
00:15:02.283 --> 00:15:04.227
Good God, this is a madman!

277
00:15:04.327 --> 00:15:06.896
What do you know about God,
you wire-haired Mick?


278
00:15:06.996 --> 00:15:09.732
Here, have 'em. 
I've given up.

279
00:15:09.832 --> 00:15:11.958
(TRAIN HORN BLARES)

280
00:15:18.216 --> 00:15:21.661
- What on earth are you doing?
- I'm reading a newspaper.


281
00:15:21.761 --> 00:15:23.621
We're in the middle of a dinner party.

282
00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:27.917
I'm sorry. I can't bear
that great, pompous herbivore in there.


283
00:15:28.017 --> 00:15:30.628
I'm sick of hearing
about her soya proteins.


284
00:15:30.728 --> 00:15:33.256
You might at least
make a bit of an effort.


285
00:15:33.356 --> 00:15:37.343
At least sit at the table.
Bring the cream.


286
00:15:37.443 --> 00:15:40.570
- Both breasts and the leg removed?
- MAN: When all's said and done,


287
00:15:40.696 --> 00:15:43.182
it's perfectly obvious
most girls love being on the pill.


288
00:15:43.282 --> 00:15:44.517
What utter balls, Jonathan.

289
00:15:44.617 --> 00:15:47.186
Do you think women like
filling their bodies with chemicals?


290
00:15:47.286 --> 00:15:50.898
- We're talking about eels, darling.
- Yes, it is most extraordinary.


291
00:15:50.998 --> 00:15:53.317
Apparently, by the year 2000,

292
00:15:53.417 --> 00:15:57.071
the level of oestrogen in the sea
will be as much as two parts per million.


293
00:15:57.171 --> 00:15:58.906
So many women taking the pill, you see.

294
00:15:59.006 --> 00:16:01.451
The problem is,
it's starting to mess up the fish.


295
00:16:01.551 --> 00:16:03.995
- They're breeding in the sea.
- I thought fish did.


296
00:16:04.095 --> 00:16:06.914
Not eels, darling. 
Eels breed in rivers.

297
00:16:07.014 --> 00:16:09.474
WOMAN: I think men should bleed.

298
00:16:13.604 --> 00:16:16.007
What a disgusting thing to say!

299
00:16:16.107 --> 00:16:17.842
You find bleeding disgusting, do you?

300
00:16:17.942 --> 00:16:20.303
Not particularly.
Just the way you said it.


301
00:16:20.403 --> 00:16:23.264
That horrible sneer
and mouth full of nuts.


302
00:16:23.364 --> 00:16:25.558
Darling, Penny is our guest.

303
00:16:25.658 --> 00:16:29.896
Women, I might inform you,
take that primitive device called the pill


304
00:16:29.996 --> 00:16:31.647
because it's all they've got.

305
00:16:31.747 --> 00:16:33.983
They don't like it.
I personally abhor it.


306
00:16:34.083 --> 00:16:36.444
But, unfortunately, it's all we've got.

307
00:16:36.544 --> 00:16:39.739
- In what context?
- In the context of bed.


308
00:16:39.839 --> 00:16:41.756
I'm surprised you need to bother.

309
00:16:47.555 --> 00:16:49.791
Cointreau, anyone?

310
00:16:49.891 --> 00:16:54.712
Darling, I know you're having
a very difficult time at the moment,


311
00:16:54.812 --> 00:16:58.216
and I know you've had rather a lot
to drink and didn't mean what you said.


312
00:16:58.316 --> 00:17:01.844
But Penny is our guest
and I'd like you to apologise.


313
00:17:01.944 --> 00:17:06.182
He doesn't need to apologise. Those kinds
of sexist attitudes are beyond apology.


314
00:17:06.282 --> 00:17:07.866
What do you mean by that?

315
00:17:09.285 --> 00:17:11.687
Do you really think I don't understand?

316
00:17:11.787 --> 00:17:16.734
You dislike me because I'm not one
of those starved little tarts you exploit.


317
00:17:16.834 --> 00:17:18.903
I don't rush out
and buy your latest makeup.


318
00:17:19.003 --> 00:17:22.490
I have a mind of my own.
And I have a body of my own


319
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:27.078
that doesn't fit into the preconceived
patterns men like you dictate.


320
00:17:27.178 --> 00:17:29.831
- You mean you're fat.
- Yes, I'm fat!


321
00:17:29.931 --> 00:17:32.083
And you're perfectly at liberty
to hate me for it.


322
00:17:32.183 --> 00:17:34.752
You're quite wrong.
I don't dislike you because of that.


323
00:17:34.852 --> 00:17:38.756
I wouldn't care if you were so huge
we had to put up scaffolding to feed you.


324
00:17:38.856 --> 00:17:41.300
Oh, for God's sake,
let's not have a row.


325
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.804
- Why not? Why shouldn't we have a row?
- Because nobody wants one!


326
00:17:44.904 --> 00:17:47.723
- You're being completely irrational.
- Irrational?


327
00:17:47.823 --> 00:17:52.061
We're all prepared to sit here
discussing mung beans and soya protein,


328
00:17:52.161 --> 00:17:54.438
but if anybody touches on
anything real, it's irrational?


329
00:17:54.538 --> 00:17:58.150
Right, then, you're being rude.
Unutterably rude and a bore!


330
00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.862
- Bagley, come and have a drink.
- I've had a drink, thank you.


331
00:18:00.962 --> 00:18:02.629
Now I'm going to have another.

332
00:18:05.633 --> 00:18:07.827
- Do you wear Y-fronts?
- Don't tell him.


333
00:18:07.927 --> 00:18:09.495
I think you're contemptible.

334
00:18:09.595 --> 00:18:12.915
And I think you are a vegan
who eats meat in secret.


335
00:18:13.015 --> 00:18:16.294
- See? She's a meat-eating vegan.
- I do not eat meat!


336
00:18:16.394 --> 00:18:18.588
But you'll eat fish
till the cows come home.


337
00:18:18.688 --> 00:18:21.340
- Don't argue with him.
- Fish is allowed!


338
00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.302
Including eels? 
Eels full of oestrogen?

339
00:18:24.402 --> 00:18:27.612
If it's buggering the eels,
think what it's doing to you.


340
00:18:28.739 --> 00:18:32.184
- Get back to your fig bottling!
- You're going out of control.


341
00:18:32.284 --> 00:18:35.104
Oh, no, I'm not.
I'm just beginning to see the light.


342
00:18:35.204 --> 00:18:38.649
- You're talking nonsense.
- It's all so clear.


343
00:18:38.749 --> 00:18:42.153
I've been living a nightmare,
obsessed with other people's acne,


344
00:18:42.253 --> 00:18:45.031
wracking my brains
to be original about boils.


345
00:18:45.131 --> 00:18:47.199
I've been going berserk!

346
00:18:47.299 --> 00:18:50.036
But then I suddenly thought
of a pork pie.


347
00:18:50.136 --> 00:18:54.832
- Get his Valium.
- I tell you, it was like a fucking brainwave!


348
00:18:54.932 --> 00:18:58.377
I have discovered that brains
are being laundered daily.


349
00:18:58.477 --> 00:19:03.064
I have found that out,
but it shall be no more!

I'm completing a process
of natural selection.


355
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:41.253
I'm going through everything in the house
and isolating items of genuine worth.

All other products, especially
those contaminated with advertising,

I am disposing of.

00:19:48.527 --> 00:19:50.137
Have you gone out of your mind?

359
00:19:50.237 --> 00:19:54.032
I know it's going to be difficult, but I'll
explain properly and you will understand.


360
00:19:54.867 --> 00:19:58.479
Dennis, listen to me.
You're under tremendous stress.


361
00:19:58.579 --> 00:20:02.191
You were drunk last night, and probably
don't realise it, but you were out of control.


362
00:20:02.291 --> 00:20:06.737
Maybe I was, but now I've had time to work
things out, get everything in perspective.


363
00:20:06.837 --> 00:20:10.741
Darling, can't you see what you're doing
this morning is equally out of control?


364
00:20:10.841 --> 00:20:14.704
Oh, no, you're quite wrong, Julia.
There's nothing out of control about me now.


365
00:20:14.804 --> 00:20:18.431
I know exactly what I'm doing now.

366

God in heaven!

Please stop that. 
I think you're ill.

369
00:20:27.441 --> 00:20:29.635
I'm gonna do those bastard
television sets in here.


370
00:20:29.735 --> 00:20:32.221
- Like you're doing the vacuum cleaner?
- That's right.


371
00:20:32.321 --> 00:20:34.015
Except I'm gonna do them better.

372
00:20:34.115 --> 00:20:37.768
I'm gonna turn them on and do them in the
middle of an advertisement for themselves.


373
00:20:37.868 --> 00:20:40.438
- I'm going to drown them.
- You call that rational, do you?

00:20:40.538 --> 00:20:42.481
Certainly. Everything I do is rational.

They feed 'em on fish,
they taste like fish,

so I shall dismember them and return them
via the sewers to the sea.

of its necessity.

on your head. You look stark raving mad.

You need help. 
You need rest.

has got on top of you.

Which is why I intend to escape.

You're not escaping it.
You're encouraging it.

- Yes.

spouting from your neck.

before in your life.

How nice.

408
00:22:39.698 --> 00:22:42.184
To me, this represents
everything that is wrong


409
00:22:42.284 --> 00:22:44.603
and everything that is vile
with this profession.

00:22:44.703 --> 00:22:48.107
- Really?
- It is the reason I'm resigning.


411
00:22:48.207 --> 00:22:52.111
- What's suddenly upset you about it?
- The hypocrisy it represents.


412
00:22:52.211 --> 00:22:54.864
- It was never used.
- Not its. Mine.


413
00:22:54.964 --> 00:22:59.577
I believed in it, and I sat back like some
gagged little idiot while they buggered it.


414
00:22:59.677 --> 00:23:02.413
- I should have resigned then.
- I see.

00:23:02.513 --> 00:23:05.791
I don't approve of its rejection.
I can no longer tolerate it.

00:23:05.891 --> 00:23:09.503
I don't approve of Her Majesty's
Government's cynical little bit of twaddle


417
00:23:09.603 --> 00:23:11.881
that smoking can seriously
damage your health

anyone was arguing about that.


420
00:23:16.485 --> 00:23:20.389
Precisely. Nobody's arguing about it,
especially the government.

00:23:20.489 --> 00:23:23.642
The only fucker this ever frightened
was the Chancellor of the Exchequer.


422
00:23:23.742 --> 00:23:26.937
But I'm going to argue about it.
I'm going to shout about it!


423
00:23:27.037 --> 00:23:30.149
- I wouldn't do that, old chap.
- Can damage your health?

having problems with the pimple cream.


432
00:23:57.276 --> 00:23:59.136
Did he? Well, he's wrong.

433
00:23:59.236 --> 00:24:02.014
Because I have eradicated
the pimple cream from my life.


434
00:24:02.114 --> 00:24:04.808
He also said you lost your temper
with some photographs.

00:24:04.908 --> 00:24:06.685
That's right. Closeups of hives.

436
00:24:06.785 --> 00:24:10.481
Don't you think the way you reacted
could be considered a little irrational?


437
00:24:10.581 --> 00:24:13.067
Don't start the old irrational
bollocks with me, Bristol!


438
00:24:13.167 --> 00:24:17.112
I'm up to here with it. I know everything
there is to know about rationality,


439
00:24:17.212 --> 00:24:19.657
and I know everything
there is to know about advertising.


440
00:24:19.757 --> 00:24:22.743
- Hold them, Sheila.
- So don't tell me I'm being irrational.


441
00:24:22.843 --> 00:24:27.096
Because I'm the man who's taken
the stench out of everything but shit.


442
00:24:30.267 --> 00:24:33.629
OK, old chap, why don't
you take some time off?


443
00:24:33.729 --> 00:24:36.131
What the fuck do you think
I'm resigning for?


444
00:24:36.231 --> 00:24:39.635
I'm taking forever off.
I'm going to cleanse my life.


445
00:24:39.735 --> 00:24:42.346
I'm going to rid my mind
and body of poisons,


446
00:24:42.446 --> 00:24:46.433
and when I've done it, I intend to make it
my life's work to encourage others to do it.


447
00:24:46.533 --> 00:24:49.728
- And how will you do that?
- By telling them, you bald fool.


448
00:24:49.828 --> 00:24:51.855
Walking up and down
with a sandwich board?


449
00:24:51.955 --> 00:24:54.566
- If necessary.
- Advertising, dear boy.


450
00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:57.278
How dare you! How...

451
00:24:57.378 --> 00:24:59.363
Aagh!

452
00:24:59.463 --> 00:25:02.157
- What's the matter, Bagley?
- I've got a boil.


453
00:25:02.257 --> 00:25:05.828
A big boil. I believe it's justice.

454
00:25:05.928 --> 00:25:09.263
The poison quitting my miserable system.

455
00:25:10.766 --> 00:25:14.169
15 years ago, I was out there
on the floor where you are now,


456
00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:16.255
and I was very like you, Bagley.

457
00:25:16.355 --> 00:25:17.881
I was the best.

458
00:25:17.981 --> 00:25:22.052
But I got myself into some
trouble with a gas-fired heating system.


459
00:25:22.152 --> 00:25:25.597
I tell you, I was desperate.
I made myself ill with worry.


460
00:25:25.697 --> 00:25:29.685
I finally ended up at a specialist
who told me I'd given myself an ulcer.


461
00:25:29.785 --> 00:25:32.187
But it was a lot
more than that to me.

462
00:25:32.287 --> 00:25:36.900
As far as I was concerned,
I'd given myself a detonator.


463
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.114
I became obsessed with fears
of spontaneous combustion.


464
00:25:42.214 --> 00:25:47.244
This gas-fired business had penetrated
so deeply into my subconscious,


465
00:25:47.344 --> 00:25:52.249
I thought I was seconds away
from bursting into flames.


466
00:25:52.349 --> 00:25:56.253
I started drinking water,
sometimes as much as 25 pints a day.


467
00:25:56.353 --> 00:25:58.630
I slept with a bucketful by the bed.

468
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:01.759
I even bought a fire extinguisher.

469
00:26:01.859 --> 00:26:05.929
I'm surprised you needed to bother.
You must have pissed like a fire engine.


470
00:26:06.029 --> 00:26:07.931
Anyway, what's all this
got to do with me?


471
00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:10.517
What I'm telling you
is that I tried to quit too,


472
00:26:10.617 --> 00:26:13.896
but the man who sat here
refused to accept my resignation.


473
00:26:13.996 --> 00:26:15.814
- Hard luck.
- Was it?


474
00:26:15.914 --> 00:26:18.150
I took a month off and went abroad,

475
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.695
rested and got myself a tan
and then I came back.


476
00:26:21.795 --> 00:26:25.449
And by Christ, Bagley,
did I sell some radiators.


477
00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:27.868
- Really?
- Never been better.


478
00:26:27.968 --> 00:26:31.330
And I'll tell you something else.
I didn't burst into flames, either.


479
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.665
Well, let's hope it's not too late.

480
00:26:33.765 --> 00:26:36.126
Cos if you went up,
it would save me a job.


481
00:26:36.226 --> 00:26:39.046
Cos I tell you, 
Bristol, any night now,

482
00:26:39.146 --> 00:26:42.732
I'm likely to turn up here
and burn this dump to the ground.


483
00:26:46.445 --> 00:26:50.307
I can't believe
how the thing could grow so quickly.


484
00:26:50.407 --> 00:26:55.077
This morning it was a pea.
Now it's like a fucking tomato.


485
00:26:56.872 --> 00:26:59.207
I can't bear it any longer, Julia.

486
00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:03.002
The bastard's on fire!

487
00:27:04.963 --> 00:27:06.782
Bathe it in warm water again.

488
00:27:06.882 --> 00:27:09.743
I have bathed it in warm water again.

489
00:27:09.843 --> 00:27:12.621
I've washed it, dried it, poked it,

490
00:27:12.721 --> 00:27:15.082
agitated it, insulted it.

491
00:27:15.182 --> 00:27:19.670
Nothing. All it does is throb
and get bigger.


492
00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:22.089
It's like a thing in a medical magazine.

493
00:27:22.189 --> 00:27:24.633
- Hasn't the mustard helped?
- Of course not.


494
00:27:24.733 --> 00:27:27.344
- Maybe you should try the English.
- This is the English.


495
00:27:27.444 --> 00:27:30.347
No, it's not, darling.
It's Dijon with fine herbs.


496
00:27:30.447 --> 00:27:33.475
- (GROANS)
- Why don't you take some aspirin?


497
00:27:33.575 --> 00:27:36.702
Never! I'm gonna knife the swine!

498
00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:42.276
Calm down! It's just a big boil.

499
00:27:42.376 --> 00:27:45.988
First thing in the morning, I'll run you
into town and we'll have it looked at.


500
00:27:46.088 --> 00:27:48.130
Now come to bed.

501
00:27:49.341 --> 00:27:51.384
Julia...

502
00:27:53.178 --> 00:27:55.164
it's just grown a hair.

503
00:27:55.264 --> 00:28:00.059
Oh, it's two o'clock in the morning!
Will you please come to bed?


504
00:28:02.104 --> 00:28:04.047
Not now.

505
00:28:04.147 --> 00:28:07.191
I gotta get down
there and do some work.

506
00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.000
Come on, race! (GIGGLES)

507
00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.310
Aah! Mmm!

508

(LAUGHING)

509
00:28:45.647 --> 00:28:47.591
Come on. He needs some help.

510
00:28:47.691 --> 00:28:49.760
What are we gonna tell him?

511
00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.722
BLUE BIRD: All we gotta do is tell him
to throw a rock through their window.


512
00:28:53.822 --> 00:28:56.600
PINK BIRD: Then knock on the door
and sell them all a burglar alarm.


513
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.603
- Right.
- Oh, this is a good idea.


514
00:28:59.703 --> 00:29:02.147
- Mwah!
- Oh, you missed me! (GIGGLES)


515
00:29:02.247 --> 00:29:04.024
I'm going again.

- Oh! Ready? Mwah!
- Mm... Mwah!

Oh, I think you're wonderful.

518
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:12.908
Shall I follow you?

519
00:29:13.008 --> 00:29:16.119
Yeah. Come on, let's hit
this cathode ray tube.


520
00:29:16.219 --> 00:29:19.414
OK. Ready? Here I go! Whee!

I need him at once!

It's alive! It lives!

00:32:14.189 --> 00:32:17.551
- What do you mean?
- It's grown a head!


535
00:32:17.651 --> 00:32:21.179
I looked at it in the bathroom mirror,
and it spoke to me!

00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:24.641
Aah! Have a look at it!

537
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:27.602
- I have, darling.
- What's it doing?


538
00:32:27.702 --> 00:32:29.479
Nothing. It's just a big boil.

539
00:32:29.579 --> 00:32:34.025
Boils don't have ears!
Boils don't have mouths that smile!


540
00:32:34.125 --> 00:32:37.362
No, darling. Neither does yours.

Come along.
We'll go and look at it together.

I don't think I dare. (WHIMPERING)

545
00:32:52.227 --> 00:32:54.880
Shall I tell you what happened?

546
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:59.259
You were dreaming. You dreamt
you woke up and went to the bathroom.


547
00:32:59.359 --> 00:33:01.261
You may have even slept walked there.

548
00:33:01.361 --> 00:33:04.681
You saw your own face in the mirror,
and it frightened you.


549
00:33:04.781 --> 00:33:06.725
Things like that are always happening

550
00:33:06.825 --> 00:33:08.868
when people are under
dreadful mental stress.


551
00:33:09.035 --> 00:33:11.772

- I'm certain of it.

00:33:30.932 --> 00:33:32.959
- What?
- I can't go into it now, but he's manic.

- Where is he?
- Upstairs.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

571
00:34:34.037 --> 00:34:37.524
How do you think he'd react to
a suggestion of psychoanalysis, Julia?


572
00:34:37.624 --> 00:34:39.734
Well, he'll agree. 
He'll have to.

573
00:34:39.834 --> 00:34:43.363
Not necessarily. He's almost
certainly convinced of his sanity.


574
00:34:43.463 --> 00:34:47.826
In which case, it might well be difficult
to persuade him a psychiatrist could help.


575
00:34:47.926 --> 00:34:51.371
The only thing he'd consent to
at the moment is me lancing the boil.


576
00:34:51.471 --> 00:34:53.665
Why don't you?
Do it now while he's asleep?

I'm not an expert
in these things, Julia.


578
00:34:56.267 --> 00:34:58.795
I don't think that's a good idea.

579
00:34:58.895 --> 00:35:03.399
Removing it in his condition might
set up some kind of permanent block.


580
00:35:04.859 --> 00:35:08.638
You've got to remember, as far as
he's concerned, I wouldn't be lancing it.


581
00:35:08.738 --> 00:35:12.491
I'd be decapitating it,
and that could be dangerous.


582
00:35:13.284 --> 00:35:15.103
We don't know who this person is.

583
00:35:15.203 --> 00:35:17.731
It might be a relative. His mother.

584
00:35:17.831 --> 00:35:20.358
- I think it's a male.
- Father, then.


585
00:35:20.458 --> 00:35:23.028
I'm sure that before any attempt
is made to get rid of it,


586
00:35:23.128 --> 00:35:24.821
you've got to find out who it is.

587
00:35:24.921 --> 00:35:26.781
Once we've done that,
we've got a good chance

00:35:26.881 --> 00:35:28.742
of converting it back to a normal boil.

589
00:35:28.842 --> 00:35:30.285
Then I'll lance it.

590
00:35:30.385 --> 00:35:34.039
For the moment, it's just a matter
of getting him to see a good psychoanalyst.


591
00:35:34.139 --> 00:35:36.625
- Do you know someone?
- I know a very good man in town.


592
00:35:36.725 --> 00:35:40.295
- It might take two or three days.
- He'll have to consent.


593
00:35:40.395 --> 00:35:43.214
- If he doesn't, we'll have to make him.
- I fear so.


594
00:35:43.314 --> 00:35:46.092
- What do you mean?
- Could involve certification.


595
00:35:46.192 --> 00:35:49.471
But he's just exhausted.
He's not really mad, is he?


596
00:35:49.571 --> 00:35:53.141
Running naked around a garden
insisting a boil has spoken to you


597
00:35:53.241 --> 00:35:55.352
is more than just exhaustion, Julia.

598
00:35:55.452 --> 00:35:58.730
Look. This is what I suggest. Tomorrow,
I'll call you with an appointment.


599
00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.123
You have to do your best
to get him there.


600
00:36:02.375 --> 00:36:05.403
For the moment, make sure he keeps
taking the tablets every two hours.


601
00:36:05.503 --> 00:36:07.614
He'll stay under control.

602
00:36:07.714 --> 00:36:10.742
When he wakes up, try and be normal.
Cook him dinner.


603
00:36:10.842 --> 00:36:12.619
You'll probably have
to go along with him.


604
00:36:12.719 --> 00:36:15.080
It'll be difficult. 
You'll have to try.

605
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:17.707
And you'd better keep a record
of what the boil says.


606
00:36:17.807 --> 00:36:19.960
At least, what he says it says.

607
00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:22.269
Could be important.

608
00:36:26.983 --> 00:36:29.485
Don't worry. We'll sort it out.

609
00:36:48.421 --> 00:36:51.199
- What are those?
- Just pills.


610
00:36:51.299 --> 00:36:53.509
Two now, two before bed.

611
00:36:57.263 --> 00:36:59.499
Do you think I'm going mad, Julia?

612
00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:01.668
Goodness gracious, no!

613
00:37:01.768 --> 00:37:05.380
Dr Gatty says you're simply
paying the price of your creativity.


614
00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:08.758
He says you have such an active imagination,
it's taking advantage of you.


615
00:37:08.858 --> 00:37:13.221
- What did he say about the boil?
- He said it's perfectly normal.


616
00:37:13.321 --> 00:37:15.015
He said it's an absolutely normal boil,

617
00:37:15.115 --> 00:37:17.574
and as soon as you've
had a proper rest, it'll go away.


618
00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.020
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.


619
00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.981
- (SIGHS)
- Trust me. Take my word for it.


620
00:37:23.081 --> 00:37:25.442
BOIL: Mmm. Smells good.

621
00:37:25.542 --> 00:37:29.404
- Smells thumb-sucking good.
- Thank you, darling.


622
00:37:29.504 --> 00:37:33.658
- I didn't say anything.
- Oh, I see.


623
00:37:33.758 --> 00:37:37.886
Now we're going to have a nice dinner,
and everything will be normal.


624
00:37:38.847 --> 00:37:42.292
And if it speaks again,
we'll ignore it, won't we?


625
00:37:42.392 --> 00:37:44.935
- (WHISTLING TUNELESSLY)
- Promise?


626
00:37:48.022 --> 00:37:51.525
- What are you doing?
- Merely whistling.


627
00:37:52.819 --> 00:37:55.388
- You're staring.
- Not at all.


628
00:37:55.488 --> 00:37:58.516
I was just getting ready
to clear my throat, that's all.


629
00:37:58.616 --> 00:38:01.326
(GRUNTING)

630
00:38:04.164 --> 00:38:07.942
It's extraordinary how much steam
comes off hot peas, isn't it?


631
00:38:08.042 --> 00:38:10.377
Yes, darling.

632
00:38:11.921 --> 00:38:13.698
BOIL: Go to France.

633
00:38:13.798 --> 00:38:16.242
Yes, fancy France?
Paris in the springtime?


634
00:38:16.342 --> 00:38:18.510
That'd be lovely.

635
00:38:19.554 --> 00:38:22.415
That's a very attractive oven glove.

636
00:38:22.515 --> 00:38:25.085
BOIL: Are you ashamed
of your false teeth?


637
00:38:25.185 --> 00:38:29.255
- I don't have false teeth.
- I know you don't, darling. I know you don't.


638
00:38:29.355 --> 00:38:33.051
What I meant was, if you did have false
teeth, would you be ashamed of them?


639
00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:36.945
- It was a hypothetical question.
- Probably not.


640
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.991
Boeuf bourguignon.

641
00:38:42.452 --> 00:38:44.479
BOIL: Breath.
For many, the unmentionable.


642
00:38:44.579 --> 00:38:46.022
(GAGS)

643
00:38:46.122 --> 00:38:49.859
- I beg your pardon, darling?
- Just happened to be thinking about it.


644
00:38:49.959 --> 00:38:53.045
Breath and false teeth and things.

645
00:38:55.048 --> 00:38:57.784
You know, there's no real reason
why we should wait.


646
00:38:57.884 --> 00:38:59.786
- For what?
- Paris.


647
00:38:59.886 --> 00:39:01.871
We could leave in a week or so.

648
00:39:01.971 --> 00:39:05.792
- We could even leave tomorrow.
- You dropped your napkin, darling.


649
00:39:05.892 --> 00:39:09.478
I'll buy a couple of polo necks,
and we could hop on a plane.


650
00:39:11.022 --> 00:39:14.759
BOIL: Put an end to the misery of dentures.
You could smile again with confidence.


651
00:39:14.859 --> 00:39:16.902
Just ask Barbara Simmons.

652
00:39:19.864 --> 00:39:21.365
Why did you say that?

653
00:39:22.617 --> 00:39:25.327
Who is Barbara Simmons?

654
00:39:26.371 --> 00:39:27.897
I don't know.

655
00:39:27.997 --> 00:39:31.317
- Then why talk about her?
- I don't know.


656
00:39:31.417 --> 00:39:35.155
- You're not really trying, you know.
- Trying what?


657
00:39:35.255 --> 00:39:38.575
Trying not to talk
about breath and false teeth


658
00:39:38.675 --> 00:39:41.327
and people with names
like Barbara Simmons.


659
00:39:41.427 --> 00:39:44.747
I am, Julia.
It's got nothing to do with me.


660
00:39:44.847 --> 00:39:47.375
It's the you-know-what.

661
00:39:47.475 --> 00:39:50.295
Well, it's ever so slightly
getting on my nerves.


662
00:39:50.395 --> 00:39:53.923
- I thought we weren't going to listen to it.
- I can't help but listen to it.


663
00:39:54.023 --> 00:39:56.384
And I can't stop
the you-know-what saying it.


664
00:39:56.484 --> 00:39:58.428
Stop saying "the you-know-what".

665
00:39:58.528 --> 00:40:00.930
All right, then. The boil.

666
00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:03.740
Darling, it is not the boil.

667
00:40:04.826 --> 00:40:06.561
Don't you think I haven't noticed?

668
00:40:06.661 --> 00:40:08.897
Every time you say something,
you turn away


669
00:40:08.997 --> 00:40:12.317
or hunch your shoulder or get under
the table so I can't see your lips moving.


670
00:40:12.417 --> 00:40:15.403
That's not the case, Julia.
I'm not turning away to speak.


671
00:40:15.503 --> 00:40:18.198
What it's doing is waiting
till I turn away before it speaks.


672
00:40:18.298 --> 00:40:21.576
That's nonsense!
It was you that suggested France.


673
00:40:21.676 --> 00:40:23.953
I did not, I merely confirmed
what the boil said.


674
00:40:24.053 --> 00:40:27.916
- Then stop siding with it!
- Don't be ridiculous! I'm not siding with it!


675
00:40:28.016 --> 00:40:32.212
I'm going crazy trying to incorporate it
into my conversation so I won't upset you.


676
00:40:32.312 --> 00:40:34.214
But I never know
what it's going to say next.


677
00:40:34.314 --> 00:40:37.050
What you'll say next.
It's you saying it.


678
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:39.969
It's the boil, Julia!
Believe me, it's the boil!


679
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:45.141
- I can't stand it any more.
- How do you think I feel about it?


680
00:40:45.241 --> 00:40:48.853
I'm on the coast of panic.
I'm staring over the edge!


681
00:40:48.953 --> 00:40:51.564
Just tell me how a boil

682
00:40:51.664 --> 00:40:54.776
can come up with a name
like Barbara Simmons?


683
00:40:54.876 --> 00:40:57.528
Say no more, Julia. 
Don't say more.

684
00:40:57.628 --> 00:41:00.490
Why should a boil suddenly
suggest going to France?


685
00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:02.825
- I don't know.
- Why not Portugal?


686
00:41:02.925 --> 00:41:04.827
I don't know. I don't know!

687
00:41:04.927 --> 00:41:07.538
Perhaps the fucker wants
to go up the Eiffel Tower!


688
00:41:07.638 --> 00:41:10.208
Maybe the bastard
wants to see the sights!


689
00:41:10.308 --> 00:41:13.253
Sit down! I'm going to call Gatty.

690
00:41:13.353 --> 00:41:15.713
- What for?
- To see if he's got you in!


691
00:41:15.813 --> 00:41:17.522
In where?

692
00:41:18.399 --> 00:41:21.719
- Stay back! You need help!
- I refuse to have that quack in here.


693
00:41:21.819 --> 00:41:23.763
I refuse to be rendered unconscious.

694
00:41:23.863 --> 00:41:26.656
You have got to see a psychiatrist.

695
00:41:30.953 --> 00:41:33.439
Are you there, Julia?

696
00:41:33.539 --> 00:41:36.025
Are you there?

697
00:41:36.125 --> 00:41:38.278
I have to be very quiet.

698
00:41:38.378 --> 00:41:40.420
He's a very light sleeper.

699
00:41:41.672 --> 00:41:43.866
I wish I could come out
and talk to you, darling.


700
00:41:43.966 --> 00:41:47.177
But it's impossible. You've seen.

701
00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:50.873
I have to tell you, Julia,

702
00:41:50.973 --> 00:41:53.960
I'm getting increasingly
concerned for my future.


703
00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.421
I don't know how this will end.

704
00:41:56.521 --> 00:41:58.089
For all I know, in a fortnight's time,

705
00:41:58.189 --> 00:42:00.466
I'll be waking up with a bald head
and a bit of a grin.


706
00:42:00.566 --> 00:42:04.512
"How do you feel, Mr Bagley?"
"Much better, thank you, doctor."


707
00:42:04.612 --> 00:42:08.182
But the one thing I'm not, darling,
is insane.


708
00:42:08.282 --> 00:42:11.034
I'm 100 percent normal.

709
00:42:12.245 --> 00:42:15.231
When I came in here,
it was my intention to make a film.


710
00:42:15.331 --> 00:42:18.359
I wanted to tell the world
about advertising.


711
00:42:18.459 --> 00:42:20.653
It's not finished, of course.

712
00:42:20.753 --> 00:42:24.991
It's difficult to concentrate
with a shanker yacking on your neck.


713
00:42:25.091 --> 00:42:27.869
Incidentally,
in case it's bothering you,


714
00:42:27.969 --> 00:42:30.330
the reason I'm wearing
this wine carton on my head


715
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:32.915
is so I can talk without disturbing it.

716
00:42:33.015 --> 00:42:35.517
It can't hear, you see?

717
00:42:36.602 --> 00:42:40.798
The world is in danger, Julia.
The greed is out of control.


718
00:42:40.898 --> 00:42:42.425
Greed is abolishing the future.

719
00:42:42.525 --> 00:42:44.635
It's turning truth
inside out and upside down.


720
00:42:44.735 --> 00:42:47.138
And this is its poisonous mouthpiece.

721
00:42:47.238 --> 00:42:49.057
BOIL: Bollocks!

722
00:42:49.157 --> 00:42:52.784
Oh, Christ! I think I've woken him up.
I'll have to be quick.


723
00:42:54.954 --> 00:42:57.774
What I have to explain
is the mechanics of a holocaust.


724
00:42:57.874 --> 00:42:59.400
BOIL: Oh, dear, oh, dear.

725
00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:03.571
I'm not talking about atom bombs,
darling. I'm talking about hamburgers.


726
00:43:03.671 --> 00:43:07.367
BOIL: I had a nasty feeling
I was going to have to wake up to this.


727
00:43:07.467 --> 00:43:11.037
If I was you, I'd turn this off, Julia.
It's only gonna upset you.


728
00:43:11.137 --> 00:43:14.832
You see what a nightmare I'm in.
You see why I can't talk to you.


729
00:43:14.932 --> 00:43:17.184
BOIL: Who are you talking to, then?

730
00:43:18.186 --> 00:43:22.048
God, it converses. 
I'm talking to it.

731
00:43:22.148 --> 00:43:25.385
- BOIL: I need a cigarette.
- Be silent, you Moloch!


732
00:43:25.485 --> 00:43:28.971
- BOIL: Moloch?
- Yes, that's you, you Moloch, you bogey!


733
00:43:29.071 --> 00:43:33.935
BOIL: If you insist we have to listen
to this bullshit, I need a cigarette.


734
00:43:34.035 --> 00:43:37.188
(SIGHS) All right, I'll get you one.
But on one condition.


735
00:43:37.288 --> 00:43:39.482
That you'll keep quiet
while you're smoking it.


736
00:43:39.582 --> 00:43:40.775
- BOIL: Deal.
- Swear!


737
00:43:40.875 --> 00:43:43.945
BOIL: I might be a shanker,
but my word is my bond.


738
00:43:44.045 --> 00:43:47.464
Don't turn off, darling.

739
00:44:26.629 --> 00:44:29.115
Oh, Mrs Wallace!
I didn't know you were here.


740
00:44:29.215 --> 00:44:33.035
- I thought everyone was out.
- My husband's outside in the van.


741
00:44:33.135 --> 00:44:36.914
- Is he? How is he?
- He's waiting to collect me.


742
00:44:37.014 --> 00:44:39.975
Is he? Julia out shopping?

743
00:44:41.811 --> 00:44:45.605
Look, I wasn't actually going through
your handbag. I need a cigarette.


744
00:44:46.607 --> 00:44:48.775
Here, you can have them all.

745
00:44:50.111 --> 00:44:52.737
I only want one. 
I don't smoke.

746
00:44:54.699 --> 00:44:55.907
Got a light?

747
00:45:02.415 --> 00:45:05.542
Vile. I'm glad I've given up.

748
00:45:06.877 --> 00:45:09.489
Morning, darling. Lovely day.

749
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:12.549
Is it? Traffic's appalling.

750
00:45:15.261 --> 00:45:18.456
You wouldn't make me
a cup of tea, would you, Sylvia?


751
00:45:18.556 --> 00:45:20.599
- Tea, Dennis?
- No, thank you.


752
00:45:22.518 --> 00:45:25.087
Don't pretend you haven't noticed
my cardboard box, Julia,


753
00:45:25.187 --> 00:45:26.380
because I know you have.

754
00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.675
And I know Mrs, Wallace,
God bless her, has noticed it too.


755
00:45:29.775 --> 00:45:32.678
But there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation,


756
00:45:32.778 --> 00:45:35.681
which I'm afraid I don't
have time to go into now.


757
00:45:35.781 --> 00:45:39.101
Matter of fact, I'm very busy now.
I better get back in there.


758
00:45:39.201 --> 00:45:42.897
- Thanks for the cigarette, Mrs Wallace.
- I thought you'd given up.


759
00:45:42.997 --> 00:45:47.083
I have. I'm not smoking it.
I'm just holding it.


760
00:45:48.085 --> 00:45:50.279
- I'll be out later.
- Don't be too long.


761
00:45:50.379 --> 00:45:52.797
We're leaving in less than an hour.

762
00:46:04.602 --> 00:46:07.004
Who's gonna tell me about it, then?

763
00:46:07.104 --> 00:46:09.215
You or the boil?

764
00:46:09.315 --> 00:46:12.343
No, no. I think we should start again.

765
00:46:12.443 --> 00:46:15.888
There's no side to any of this.
There is me. There is a boil.


766
00:46:15.988 --> 00:46:19.308
The boil happens to be able to speak, but
that doesn't qualify it to give an opinion.


767
00:46:19.408 --> 00:46:22.228
It was me that decided
to come here, not it.


768
00:46:22.328 --> 00:46:25.815
You don't think the inclusion
of the boil could perhaps help us?


769
00:46:25.915 --> 00:46:27.817
No. I'm not interested in its opinions.

770
00:46:27.917 --> 00:46:30.361
Even if it says something
that might be of relevance?


771
00:46:30.461 --> 00:46:32.822
I'm not interested in it,
no matter what it says.


772
00:46:32.922 --> 00:46:35.658
In my opinion,
it should be lanced instantly.


773
00:46:35.758 --> 00:46:38.828
It was the only reason
I agreed to come off the garage roof.


774
00:46:38.928 --> 00:46:41.304
If it wants to join in,
it can pay its own bill.


775
00:46:44.433 --> 00:46:46.434
Come and lie down.

776
00:46:47.978 --> 00:46:49.854
Please.

777
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:59.030
(WHIRRING)

778
00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.663
Tell me about advertising.

779
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:15.489
Now, you resigned from an important
firm with a very highly paid job.


780
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:18.299
I'd like to know your reasons.

781
00:47:19.343 --> 00:47:22.288
Well, at least try
and give me an example


782
00:47:22.388 --> 00:47:24.915
of even one of those reasons.

783
00:47:25.015 --> 00:47:28.419
All right. Reason one.

784
00:47:28.519 --> 00:47:30.796
Advertising conspires with Big Brother.

785
00:47:30.896 --> 00:47:33.966
And you're afraid of Big Brother?

786
00:47:34.066 --> 00:47:37.219
Someone or something
coming into your life


787
00:47:37.319 --> 00:47:38.763
and telling you what to do?

788
00:47:38.863 --> 00:47:43.517
No. I'm not afraid of him. I'm one
of the few who really understands him.


789
00:47:43.617 --> 00:47:44.769
Oh?

790
00:47:44.869 --> 00:47:46.812
The man who conceived of Big Brother

791
00:47:46.912 --> 00:47:48.773
never knew what was coming
down the line.


792
00:47:48.873 --> 00:47:51.776
Thought his filthy creation
was gonna be watching us.


793
00:47:51.876 --> 00:47:55.696
But it is us who watch it.
There's one in every living room.


794
00:47:55.796 --> 00:48:00.409
The monstrous injustice of it is,
we stare at it of our own free will.


795
00:48:00.509 --> 00:48:03.746
So we could say, principally,
that it's television that you blame?


796
00:48:03.846 --> 00:48:07.500
We can say entirely it is the crooks
who've infiltrated it that I blame.


797
00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:10.836
They've moved in on the greatest
means of communication since the wheel.


798
00:48:10.936 --> 00:48:13.714
And now they've done it,
their greed is insatiable.


799
00:48:13.814 --> 00:48:16.550
They're cutting down jungles
to breed hamburgers,


800
00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:19.011
turning the whole world into a car park.

801
00:48:19.111 --> 00:48:22.890
They'd sell off the sea to satisfy
the needs of their great god Greed.


802
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:25.643
They won't be satisfied,
not till we're all squatting


803
00:48:25.743 --> 00:48:28.062
in one of its fucking hatchbacks
on a motorway.


804
00:48:28.162 --> 00:48:30.189
There isn't going to be
anywhere left to go


805
00:48:30.289 --> 00:48:33.984
except in slow revolutions towards
the crest of the next slag heap.


806
00:48:34.084 --> 00:48:36.278
Do you have trouble
in getting an erection?


807
00:48:36.378 --> 00:48:39.156
- What?
- Can you get an erection?


808
00:48:39.256 --> 00:48:41.492
- Yes!
- Masturbating much?


809
00:48:41.592 --> 00:48:44.745
Constantly! I've got
a talking boil on my neck!


810
00:48:44.845 --> 00:48:47.498
What would you do?

811
00:48:47.598 --> 00:48:49.682
What does this mean to you?

812
00:48:51.060 --> 00:48:54.296
"Are you ashamed of your false teeth?

813
00:48:54.396 --> 00:48:57.133
"Put an end to the miseries of dentures.

814
00:48:57.233 --> 00:48:59.343
"You could smile again with confidence.

815
00:48:59.443 --> 00:49:01.387
"Just ask Barbara Simmons."

816
00:49:01.487 --> 00:49:06.100
The boil said it a few nights ago.
Sounds like a particularly crude voiceover.


817
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:09.061
- Voiceover?
- The voice that sells.


818
00:49:09.161 --> 00:49:11.647
If you're selling perfume,
it sounds like a lover.


819
00:49:11.747 --> 00:49:14.567
If you're selling something
inedible you want people to eat,


820
00:49:14.667 --> 00:49:17.111
it'll sound as stupid
as they'll have to be to buy it.


821
00:49:17.211 --> 00:49:20.740
In this case, it would sound
like a dentist, someone in the know.


822
00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:24.535
I see. So one could say that it's,
erm, the voice of authority?


823
00:49:24.635 --> 00:49:27.329
Like, erm...
Well, like a parent's voice, almost?


824
00:49:27.429 --> 00:49:28.873
If you like.

825
00:49:28.973 --> 00:49:31.167
Has the boil spoken this morning?

826
00:49:31.267 --> 00:49:35.421
Yes, I had a row with it, and it got
very heated when I refused to shave.


827
00:49:35.521 --> 00:49:38.841
- Tell me about your parents.
- Not part of the plot.


828
00:49:38.941 --> 00:49:40.885
As far as I know,
they were completely normal.


829
00:49:40.985 --> 00:49:44.722
- I come from a completely normal family.
- BOIL: Tell him about your grandfather.


830
00:49:44.822 --> 00:49:47.016
That was the boil. Ignore it.

831
00:49:47.116 --> 00:49:49.200
I don't think we should do that.

832
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:54.648
It's the first time it's spoken in front
of me, and it might be important.


833
00:49:54.748 --> 00:49:58.986
It has nothing important to say. It is
destructive, self-satisfied and abusive.


834
00:49:59.086 --> 00:50:01.155
- BOIL: You cun...
- You see? Don't listen.


835
00:50:01.255 --> 00:50:04.325
BOIL: Come on. Fair's fair.
You've had your say. Now I'll have mine.


836
00:50:04.425 --> 00:50:06.243
Don't listen to it! 
Don't listen to it!

837
00:50:06.343 --> 00:50:09.079
Why don't you tell me
about your grandfather?


838
00:50:09.179 --> 00:50:12.291
If you tell me,
the boil might be quiet.

839
00:50:12.391 --> 00:50:16.712
My grandfather was caught molesting
a wallaby in a private zoo in 1919.


840
00:50:16.812 --> 00:50:19.799
- A wallaby?
- May have been a kangaroo. I'm not sure.


841
00:50:19.899 --> 00:50:23.761
- You mean sexually?
- Suppose so. He had his hand in its pouch.


842
00:50:23.861 --> 00:50:25.888
- BOIL: Fucked it, didn't he?
- He did not fuck it!


843
00:50:25.988 --> 00:50:28.015
Just... just lie back.

844
00:50:28.115 --> 00:50:30.559
(GASPS)

845
00:50:30.659 --> 00:50:34.730
- What happened to him?
- He pleaded insanity and got three months.


846
00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:38.651
Does the authoritarian attitude
they took with him upset you?


847
00:50:38.751 --> 00:50:41.821
- No. He died before I was born.
- Do you sympathise with him?


848
00:50:41.921 --> 00:50:43.989
If I had been stuck in a trench
for three years,


849
00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:47.284
- I might do something stupid myself.
- Like showing affection for an animal?


850
00:50:47.384 --> 00:50:48.786
- BOIL: He'd fuck one.
- Shut up!


851
00:50:48.886 --> 00:50:51.330
BOIL: Ask Barbara Simmons.
He'd fuck her as well.


852
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:55.709
Oh, my God. How could the boil have
possibly known about my grandfather?


853
00:50:55.809 --> 00:50:58.796
(GASPING)
That means it can read my mind.


854
00:50:58.896 --> 00:51:01.731
No, Mr Bagley, it does not.

855
00:51:04.068 --> 00:51:08.597
We'll speak about that in a moment,
when we've had a look at this boil.


856
00:51:08.697 --> 00:51:12.852
What you mean is you want
me to have a look at it. No.


857
00:51:12.952 --> 00:51:15.729
What would you say if I said
that you don't want to look at it


858
00:51:15.829 --> 00:51:18.274
because you're frightened
of what you might see?


859
00:51:18.374 --> 00:51:21.026
I'd say you'd be absolutely right.

860
00:51:21.126 --> 00:51:24.154
Isn't that trying to pretend
it doesn't exist?


861
00:51:24.254 --> 00:51:28.007
Isn't that exactly what you're accusing
everyone else of doing?


862
00:51:31.387 --> 00:51:34.206
Now, we must reduce
this guilt in two ways.


863
00:51:34.306 --> 00:51:37.543
First, it must be physically
reduced with surgery.


864
00:51:37.643 --> 00:51:41.171
And secondly, we must reduce
your punishing conscience


865
00:51:41.271 --> 00:51:44.049
by refusing to allow it to hide.

866
00:51:44.149 --> 00:51:47.261
Once we get it out into the open,
it'll be easier to fight.


867
00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:50.556
And I'm certain that
by the time your neck's healed,


868
00:51:50.656 --> 00:51:53.809
you'll be smiling at this problem
and be back at work.


869
00:51:53.909 --> 00:51:57.146
Never. No matter what you reduce,
I will never go back to advertising.


870
00:51:57.246 --> 00:52:03.376
Perhaps. But now, let's have a look
at this bully on your neck.


871
00:52:21.145 --> 00:52:23.229
Just look at it in the mirror...

872
00:52:25.482 --> 00:52:27.567
and tell me what you see.

873
00:52:32.031 --> 00:52:34.282
- Oh, God in heaven!
- (COUGHS)


874
00:52:35.534 --> 00:52:37.660
It's grown a moustache!

875
00:52:38.412 --> 00:52:39.939
Oh, my God!

876
00:52:40.039 --> 00:52:43.192
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.


877
00:52:43.292 --> 00:52:45.319
- (WHIMPERS)
- Yes?


878
00:52:45.419 --> 00:52:48.421
The bastard looks just like me!

879
00:52:50.466 --> 00:52:52.534
PSYCHIATRIST: What you must understand

880
00:52:52.634 --> 00:52:56.205
is that it's not the boil
that can read you.


881
00:52:56.305 --> 00:53:00.584
It is you, Mr Bagley,
that can read the boil.


882
00:53:00.684 --> 00:53:02.878
You can read it because it is you.

883
00:53:02.978 --> 00:53:04.922
At least, a part of you.

884
00:53:05.022 --> 00:53:06.590
The boil knows what you're thinking

885
00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:10.427
because you've projected
some of you into it.


886
00:53:10.527 --> 00:53:13.973
You've given it the side
that you find intolerable,


887
00:53:14.073 --> 00:53:18.143
the bullying, aggressive,
dictatorial side.


888
00:53:18.243 --> 00:53:22.606
The side that sells toothpaste and soap.

889
00:53:22.706 --> 00:53:27.069
You've decided that selling these things
is a bad thing for you to do,


890
00:53:27.169 --> 00:53:30.698
and you are unable to accept
the guilt for what you feel you've done.


891
00:53:30.798 --> 00:53:34.342
Therefore, you've transmitted
these qualities into the boil.


892
00:53:35.135 --> 00:53:38.914
Perhaps, by doing this,
you hope to escape your guilt.


893
00:53:39.014 --> 00:53:44.211
But you've created a symbol
of foul-mouthed authority instead.


894
00:53:44.311 --> 00:53:47.089
Your very own Big Brother.

895

(DOOR OPENS)

896
00:53:52.611 --> 00:53:55.514
- Welcome back. My name's Debra.
- My head.


897
00:53:55.614 --> 00:53:58.116
Come on. Let's sit you up straight.

898
00:53:59.118 --> 00:54:01.687
Up we go. There we are.

899
00:54:01.787 --> 00:54:04.163
- Have they done it?
- In the morning.


900
00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:06.442
- You hungry?
- No.


901
00:54:06.542 --> 00:54:09.987
I'll bring you something anyway.
There's beef burgers or fish fingers.


902
00:54:10.087 --> 00:54:13.115
I can hardly move my arms.
I can hardly move anything.


903
00:54:13.215 --> 00:54:16.384
Barbiturate.
They gave you a whopping dose.


904
00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:23.751
BOIL: You should have had
the fish fingers.


905
00:54:23.851 --> 00:54:26.795
Mouthwatering fillets
of young cod, matey,


906

in a crisp, golden batter, my mate.

907
00:54:29.773 --> 00:54:33.052
Shut up. You never talk in front
of people, so don't talk in front of me.


908
00:54:33.152 --> 00:54:36.180
BOIL: Suit yourself.
Suit yourself. Suit yourself.


909

Just thought you might be interested in
a little light rabbit to while the time away.


910

Fuck me. What I wouldn't do
for a cigarette.


911
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:47.066
- Who are you? What do you want?
- I am your better half.

- You're not!
- Mais oui, je suis.

He did not!
You're just a dirty carbuncle.


915
00:54:56.383 --> 00:54:58.202
There's no reason to raise your voice.

916
00:54:58.302 --> 00:55:02.206
There's no reason why we shouldn't pass
these last few hours together amicably.


917
00:55:02.306 --> 00:55:04.541
- Be quiet.
- That wouldn't be fair.


918
00:55:04.641 --> 00:55:07.461
I listened to you
and all that Big Brother muck.


919
00:55:07.561 --> 00:55:09.880
Don't mind telling you,
I was bored stiff.


920
00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.299
I had absolutely nothing
to do under there.


921
00:55:12.399 --> 00:55:14.468
Except tend me moustache, of course.

Big Granddad.

How did you find out
about my grandfather?


924

Walls have ears, Dennis.
I overheard Julia telling Gatty.


925
00:55:23.952 --> 00:55:25.646
Nice pair of tits, Julia.

926
00:55:25.746 --> 00:55:27.773
I believe you was unconscious
at the time.


927
00:55:27.873 --> 00:55:31.068
You bastard! I only have one wish,

928
00:55:31.168 --> 00:55:33.946
and that is that I could be awake
to see you lanced.


929
00:55:34.046 --> 00:55:36.115
I'd like to see the knife going in.

930
00:55:36.215 --> 00:55:38.117
I'd like to see you suffer.

- A typically communist statement.
- I'm not a communist!


932
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:43.539
Yes, you are. You want
to take everyone's car away.


933
00:55:43.639 --> 00:55:45.666
I do not want to take
anything from anyone.


934
00:55:45.766 --> 00:55:48.168
I want to give them
the choice of something better.


935
00:55:48.268 --> 00:55:50.045
- Oh, yes? What?
- Trains.


936
00:55:50.145 --> 00:55:53.757
Trains? Trains are no good.
They're old-fashioned.


937
00:55:53.857 --> 00:55:57.511
- I hate trains. They're rotten.
- Only because they don't consume.


938
00:55:57.611 --> 00:56:00.973
Only because they're already there
and don't eat up more and more and more.


939
00:56:01.073 --> 00:56:03.517
That's why you hate them.
That's why government hates them.


940
00:56:03.617 --> 00:56:05.644
That's why they're
old-fashioned and rotten.


941
00:56:05.744 --> 00:56:09.439
- You commies don't half talk a lot of shit.
- Shut up! I'm not a communist!


942
00:56:09.539 --> 00:56:11.692
I refuse to argue with a carbuncle.

943
00:56:11.792 --> 00:56:13.402
- You are a communist.
- Fuck off!


944
00:56:13.502 --> 00:56:16.155
That's very rude of you, Mr Bagley.

945

Nobody's forcing you to have supper.

That was the boil.

about your boil, Mr Bagley.

It's a massacre.

995

But I've gotta warn you,
at first it might sound ridiculous.


996
00:59:46.089 --> 00:59:51.078
It's radical and not without its risks,
but I'm certain I can pull it off.


997
00:59:51.178 --> 00:59:54.623
And what it is, is Lawrence of Arabia

998
00:59:54.723 --> 00:59:57.224
and a little town called Aqaba.

999
00:59:58.185 --> 01:00:00.379
The last thing they expected
was for Lawrence


1000
01:00:00.479 --> 01:00:03.173
to come roaring across the desert
and attack them from behind.


1001
01:00:03.273 --> 01:00:06.426
It seemed impossible.
And because it was impossible,


1002
01:00:06.526 --> 01:00:09.846
all their defences faced the wrong way.

1003
01:00:09.946 --> 01:00:12.682
And that's how I want
to sell this pimple cream.


1004
01:00:12.782 --> 01:00:16.019
I want to come in from behind,
where they least expect me,


1005
01:00:16.119 --> 01:00:18.078
just like Lawrence of Arabia.

1006
01:00:21.666 --> 01:00:27.489
Now. As I see it, we've gotta
forget this for at least three months.


1007
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:29.825
I estimate that
as the very minimum we need


1008
01:00:29.925 --> 01:00:32.285
to create the ravenous market I'm after.

1009
01:00:32.385 --> 01:00:36.706
- And how are you gonna do that?
- By glamorising boils.


1010
01:00:36.806 --> 01:00:39.584
- Glamorise them?
- That's right.


1011
01:00:39.684 --> 01:00:41.128
I want to make them fashionable.

1012
01:00:41.228 --> 01:00:44.548
I want to encourage every kid
to take a pride in his breakouts.


1013
01:00:44.648 --> 01:00:47.843
I want to sell them the idea
that boils are beautiful.


1014
01:00:47.943 --> 01:00:51.012
If I can do that, I can treble
the market at a minimum.


1015
01:00:51.112 --> 01:00:52.222
That's absurd.

1016

To sell atom bombs,
you've got to sell fear.


1017

If you want to sell this pimple cream,
you've got to encourage pimples.

- Then what's up?


1070

Oh, I don't know.
I'm just so wound up about Dennis,

terrified his thing
will start talking again.

- Not exactly.

But I had this terrible, terrible dream,
Penny, a nightmare,


1074
01:04:24.784 --> 01:04:28.021
- and I can't get it out of my head.
- Mrs Bagley, the musicians are here.


1075
01:04:28.121 --> 01:04:31.149
Tell them to come in, Sylvia,
do whatever they like.

We can't talk here.
Come and have a drink.


1077
01:04:37.338 --> 01:04:41.008
It said Dennis wasn't my husband.
It said it was.


1078
01:04:42.677 --> 01:04:46.180
And it said it with
this horrible sort of mouth.


1079
01:04:47.098 --> 01:04:50.210
It said Dennis is an incarnation
of evil with a briefcase.


1080
01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:52.837
It kept going on about a briefcase.

1081
01:04:52.937 --> 01:04:56.966
Then it said, "Zero, zero, zero,"
again and again and again.


1082
01:04:57.066 --> 01:05:01.304
- And what's "Zero, zero, zero"?
- (SIGHS) It's horrendous. I don't know.

- And that's it?
- No.


1084
01:05:05.325 --> 01:05:09.062
Then it told me to get an electric
carving knife and cut his head off.


1085
01:05:09.162 --> 01:05:12.357
It's not funny, Penny. It's the most
terrifying experience of my life.


1086
01:05:12.457 --> 01:05:14.943
- So real, it could have been real.
- Have you told Dennis?


1087
01:05:15.043 --> 01:05:18.405
Of course not. The last thing
I want to do is excite him.


1088
01:05:18.505 --> 01:05:20.949
I tell you, Penny, I'm still
waiting to scream about it.


1089
01:05:21.049 --> 01:05:22.492
- Come along.
- Along where?


1090
01:05:22.592 --> 01:05:24.786
- We're gonna look in the case.
- Don't be so silly.


1091
01:05:24.886 --> 01:05:27.205
Dennis doesn't even have a briefcase.
He loathes them.


1092
01:05:27.305 --> 01:05:29.624
- Uses an old doctor's bag.

the one accused of being silly.

I'm surprised you get to sleep at all.

he's been peculiar, sexually.

He's obsessed
with blackheads and fucking.

- But you've always adored fucking.

I can't bear him touching me.

I don't know why, but I can't.
I'm running out of headaches.


1105

He's absolutely sex mad.

1106
01:06:09.639 --> 01:06:12.375
Yesterday evening, he said
he wished I had nipples on my arse.

But he's all right, isn't he?

- Absolutely. He's fine.

Well, let me put your mind at rest.

Firstly, on a purely ideological basis,

1150
01:08:17.976 --> 01:08:20.420
it's out of the question.

1151

In the name of humanity,
cut your filthy throat.

so why don't you try and do it
with some dignity?


1170
01:09:18.077 --> 01:09:20.813
Dignity? You're corruption.

1171
01:09:20.913 --> 01:09:23.900
Julia! Julia!

1172
01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.195
50 per cent of politics
is about creating a problem.


1173
01:09:27.295 --> 01:09:29.489
The other 50 percent
is about offering to solve it.


1174
01:09:29.589 --> 01:09:31.366
All you've got to do
is bugger something up,


1175
01:09:31.466 --> 01:09:33.785
then hasten to your nearest
TV station with a solution.


1176
01:09:33.885 --> 01:09:36.913
Doesn't matter what it is.
The environment, hospitals, crime...


1177
01:09:37.013 --> 01:09:41.600
Create a crime wave and up will pop some
perfectly plausible head-selling police.


1178
01:09:41.726 --> 01:09:44.879
- The rock through the window technique.
- That's exactly what it is.


1179
01:09:44.979 --> 01:09:47.298
It might work on everyone else.
It doesn't work on me.


1180
01:09:47.398 --> 01:09:51.260
If you breathe air, it works on you.
Large one, no ice, please, Richard.


1181
01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:55.306
If you're aware of it, how can you bear
to work in an industry that perpetuates it?


1182
01:09:55.406 --> 01:09:59.102
It's probably a defect from birth.
Come and rescue me. I'm being attacked.


1183
01:09:59.202 --> 01:10:01.312
- Who's attacking you?
- Penelope here.


1184
01:10:01.412 --> 01:10:03.982
She's telling me off because
I think your husband's a genius.


1185
01:10:04.082 --> 01:10:08.027
It's outrageous that Dennis should be
allowed to manipulate children's minds.


1186
01:10:08.127 --> 01:10:11.489
There is the dear boy. Come along.
I want to ask you both a question.


1187
01:10:11.589 --> 01:10:13.866
Is that him?

1188
01:10:13.966 --> 01:10:16.927
- He's very good-looking.
- If you like that sort of thing.


1189
01:10:17.929 --> 01:10:22.000
- Julia seems terribly tense.
- Surprised? It's him.


1190
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:25.336
He had an operation.
Went weird in the bed department.


1191
01:10:25.436 --> 01:10:28.673
- What do you mean?
- Sex. Hello, Basil.


1192
01:10:28.773 --> 01:10:30.675
- Hello, Penny. Lovely party.
- Super.


1193
01:10:30.775 --> 01:10:33.678
- Apparently, he's insatiable.
- Really?


1194
01:10:33.778 --> 01:10:36.806
Dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.

1195
01:10:36.906 --> 01:10:41.269
Shouldn't really be telling you this.
It was said in the strictest of confidence.


1196
01:10:41.369 --> 01:10:43.312
And that's exactly how I'm telling you.

1197
01:10:43.412 --> 01:10:46.357
She said he's got a permanent horn.

1198
01:10:46.457 --> 01:10:48.860
- Really?
- She said she's desperate.


1199
01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.987
The other night, she woke up
and caught him


1200
01:10:51.087 --> 01:10:53.281
down the bed
with a huge black rubber torch.


1201
01:10:53.381 --> 01:10:55.450
- Torch?
- Flashlight.


1202
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:57.785
- Doing what?
- Scrutinising.


1203
01:10:57.885 --> 01:11:02.123
He was under the covers.
Said he'd lost something. Contact lens.


1204
01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:03.666
Said he didn't want to wake her up.

1205
01:11:03.766 --> 01:11:06.669
And unlucky for her that he did,
cos she got another hour's worth.


1206
01:11:06.769 --> 01:11:10.423
I'm not going to make a speech.
I'd just like to thank you all for coming


1207
01:11:10.523 --> 01:11:13.301
and for making our anniversary
so special.


1208
01:11:13.401 --> 01:11:16.971
And most of all, I'd like
to thank Julia for organising it all


1209
01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:20.031
- and for being such a special wife.
- (APPLAUSE)


1210
01:11:25.955 --> 01:11:28.775
How about a toast to Bagley and Julia?

1211
01:11:28.875 --> 01:11:31.527
- Bagley and Julia.
- Bagley and Julia.


1212
01:11:31.627 --> 01:11:35.073
I'd also like to propose
a small snifter to our new star.


1213
01:11:35.173 --> 01:11:37.742
- I thought she was coming.
- She is, she's been held up.


1214
01:11:37.842 --> 01:11:39.994
- To Phyllis Blokey.
- Phyllis.


1215
01:11:40.094 --> 01:11:41.788
- Phyllis.
- Blokey.


1216
01:11:41.888 --> 01:11:45.557
- She's the singer with the boils.
- To boils, acne and blackheads.


1217
01:11:46.767 --> 01:11:48.753
What's this cream
going to be called, anyway?


1218
01:11:48.853 --> 01:11:52.381
Don't know yet. Right now we're stuck
with "Filthy Harry's Final Solution".


1219
01:11:52.481 --> 01:11:55.593
- Who's Filthy Harry?
- You know, Harry Wax. Creative.


1220
01:11:55.693 --> 01:11:59.889
- The only man here in a hired suit.
- He's as close as a Doberman's balls.


1221
01:11:59.989 --> 01:12:02.642
- (CHUCKLES)
- Don't want to say anything bad about him.


1222
01:12:02.742 --> 01:12:05.436
- Then don't.
- PENNY: This is excellent.


1223
01:12:05.536 --> 01:12:08.606
Yes, I was about to say,
I notice Penny's gone carnivorous.


1224
01:12:08.706 --> 01:12:12.110
- She lacked protein.
- And minerals.


1225
01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:14.946
I wasn't getting all I needed
out of normal green stuff.


1226
01:12:15.046 --> 01:12:18.381
I don't think anyone would ever
encourage me to grow boils.


1227
01:12:21.177 --> 01:12:23.621
You're not the market
I'm after, darling.


1228
01:12:23.721 --> 01:12:25.873
But if you were, I would.

1229
01:12:25.973 --> 01:12:29.293
I could sell you anything
from a boil to a hydrogen bomb.


1230
01:12:29.393 --> 01:12:33.297
- I don't think so. I'm anti-nuke.
- Hear, hear.


1231
01:12:33.397 --> 01:12:35.383
How's the new book coming along, Penny?

1232
01:12:35.483 --> 01:12:38.261
BOIL: Shall I tell you
why people buy hydrogen bombs?


1233
01:12:38.361 --> 01:12:41.806
Because they're not like
the bombs people used to use in wars.


1234
01:12:41.906 --> 01:12:44.517
We put an added ingredient
into bombs these days.


1235
01:12:44.617 --> 01:12:46.477
It's called peace.

1236
01:12:46.577 --> 01:12:49.355
Our warheads are stuffed
to the brim with it.


1237
01:12:49.455 --> 01:12:51.691
We're years ahead
of the competition, of course.


1238
01:12:51.791 --> 01:12:55.695
- The Russians don't put peace in theirs.
- Very good, Bagley.


1239
01:12:55.795 --> 01:12:59.198
Can anyone think of a discreet
way of changing the subject?


1240
01:12:59.298 --> 01:13:01.742
I'm sorry, Julia. I'm afraid
Dennis is absolutely right.


1241
01:13:01.842 --> 01:13:05.204
There's a splendid example of what
he's talking about outside our building.


1242
01:13:05.304 --> 01:13:07.415
- Ever looked at it?
- Can't say as I have.


1243
01:13:07.515 --> 01:13:11.377
Well, there's an obelisk there
to the glory of the Royal Marines,


1244
01:13:11.477 --> 01:13:16.966
and it's a plaque depicting a Marine
shoving his bayonet into a Chinaman's guts.


1245
01:13:17.066 --> 01:13:21.095
He's so shocked, his pigtail's
sticking up like an exclamation mark.


1246
01:13:21.195 --> 01:13:25.099
And underneath it says,
"Shanghai Campaign, 1898."


1247
01:13:25.199 --> 01:13:29.312
Imagine seeing that in Peking.
A plaque of a Chinaman


1248
01:13:29.412 --> 01:13:32.565
pumping his bayonet into
an Englishman halfway up Regent Street,


1249
01:13:32.665 --> 01:13:35.067
a bowler hat, levitating in shock,

1250
01:13:35.167 --> 01:13:39.280
and underneath,
"West London Campaign, 1898."


1251
01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:43.633
BAGLEY: Why don't you shut your trap,
you cynical old anus?


1252
01:13:47.263 --> 01:13:49.639
A joke. Just a joke.

1253
01:13:53.602 --> 01:13:57.715
Don't think the bandages might be
a bit on the tight side, Bagley?


1254
01:13:57.815 --> 01:14:00.259
No. Perfect, thank you.

1255
01:14:00.359 --> 01:14:02.887
BAGLEY: Julia! Julia!

1256
01:14:02.987 --> 01:14:05.139
Are you all right, darling?

1257
01:14:05.239 --> 01:14:07.225
Marvellous.

1258
01:14:07.325 --> 01:14:10.243
Would you excuse me for a moment?

1259
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:19.711
(WHISPERS)
I tell you, he's absolutely barking.


1260
01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:23.824
Criminal. You filthy criminal!

1261
01:14:23.924 --> 01:14:27.370
Shut up, you little moron!
I'd like to wring your bastard neck!


1262
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:31.791
Do it, then. Do it.
Put me out of my misery.


1263
01:14:31.891 --> 01:14:35.378
Oh, no, not yet,
you unwholesome pustule.


1264
01:14:35.478 --> 01:14:37.755
I want you to
live just a bit longer.

1265
01:14:37.855 --> 01:14:41.259
I want you around tonight
when the shagging begins.


1266
01:14:41.359 --> 01:14:43.052
(MUFFLED GROAN)

1267
01:14:43.152 --> 01:14:45.596
Tasty bit of glue, is it?

1268
01:14:45.696 --> 01:14:47.781
Here, have another suck.

1269
01:14:49.116 --> 01:14:51.076
Let's hear you squawk now.

1270
01:14:55.122 --> 01:15:00.319
<i>âª So I chaffed
them and I gaily laughed</i>

1271
01:15:00.419 --> 01:15:07.967
<i>âª To think they would doubt my love</i>

1272
01:15:08.719 --> 01:15:13.874
<i>âª Yet today, my love has gone away</i>

1273
01:15:13.974 --> 01:15:21.965
- <i>âª I am without my love âª</i>
- (RAUCOUS LAUGHTER)


1274
01:15:24.235 --> 01:15:27.847
- Come on, Julia. Come and dance.
- <i>âª Now laughing friends deride âª</i>


1275
01:15:27.947 --> 01:15:29.598
Not now, darling.

1276
01:15:29.698 --> 01:15:32.268
- <i>âª Tears I cannot hide âª</i>
- Come on. I insist.


1277
01:15:32.368 --> 01:15:35.187
Go on. It's his anniversary.

1278
01:15:35.287 --> 01:15:41.777
âª Mm, well, so I smile and say

1279
01:15:41.877 --> 01:15:46.198
- <i>âª When a lovely flame dies âª</i>
- (GRUNTING)


1280
01:15:46.298 --> 01:15:54.431
<i>âª Smoke gets in your eyes âª</i>

1281
01:16:10.781 --> 01:16:12.866
(SNORTING AND GRUNTING)

1282
01:16:15.661 --> 01:16:19.023
- Have you got a cold?
- Not my drug.


1283
01:16:19.123 --> 01:16:23.168
(SNIFFS) I know that smell. Givenchy.

1284
01:16:24.837 --> 01:16:28.506
Oh! You don't have to hold me
quite so tightly, Dennis.


1285
01:16:29.425 --> 01:16:32.244
Sorry. Afraid the clinch
is the only dance I know.


1286
01:16:32.344 --> 01:16:33.746
Heh.

1287
01:16:33.846 --> 01:16:36.499
BAGLEY: Oh, Julia. 
Julia, darling.

1288
01:16:36.599 --> 01:16:39.210
No. Monica.

1289
01:16:39.310 --> 01:16:41.545
I know.

1290
01:16:41.645 --> 01:16:46.217
BAGLEY: Julia.
Please don't scream or pull away.


1291
01:16:46.317 --> 01:16:48.803
We might never get this chance again.

1292
01:16:48.903 --> 01:16:53.349
It's difficult for me to talk,
because my sinuses are full of glue.


1293
01:16:53.449 --> 01:16:55.518
You're not wearing a bra.

1294
01:16:55.618 --> 01:16:57.645
Not really.

1295
01:16:57.745 --> 01:16:59.829
(GRUNTING)

1296
01:17:02.833 --> 01:17:05.778
BAGLEY:
I love you. I love you desperately.


1297
01:17:05.878 --> 01:17:09.073
This isn't a dream. It's reality.

1298
01:17:09.173 --> 01:17:11.742
Don't speak. Just listen. 
I'm desperate.

1299
01:17:11.842 --> 01:17:14.245
You're going to need a condom,
and quick!


1300
01:17:14.345 --> 01:17:16.455
The fucking's going to start
in about an hour,


1301
01:17:16.555 --> 01:17:19.875
and believe me, you're going
to have a monster on top of you.


1302
01:17:19.975 --> 01:17:21.669
Aah!

1303
01:17:21.769 --> 01:17:23.587
Stay away from me! Keep away!

1304
01:17:23.687 --> 01:17:27.341
Has the bastard been whispering to you?
Bastard! Bastard!


1305
01:17:27.441 --> 01:17:28.900
- It's all right.
- Bastard!


1306
01:17:30.402 --> 01:17:32.304
Oh!

1307
01:17:32.404 --> 01:17:35.990
Everything's under control.
Please stay and enjoy the party.


1308
01:17:37.493 --> 01:17:39.103
- Sorry.
- Monica?


1309
01:17:39.203 --> 01:17:42.356
I'm sorry, Julia, but I think
your husband's completely bananas!


1310
01:17:42.456 --> 01:17:46.193
Going along with someone is not the same
as listening to a tirade of obscenity!


1311
01:17:46.293 --> 01:17:48.670
- What did he say?
- I can't tell you.


1312
01:17:49.964 --> 01:17:51.949
- I'm sorry, Julia.
- Bye, darling.


1313
01:17:52.049 --> 01:17:53.659
- Lovely party.
- Thank you.


1314
01:17:53.759 --> 01:17:56.036
- Richard, your case.
- Oh, no, it's not mine.


1315
01:17:56.136 --> 01:17:58.388
It belongs to Bagley.
He left it at the studio.


1316
01:18:12.778 --> 01:18:14.988
JULIA: Boil?

1317
01:18:22.496 --> 01:18:23.939
Boil!

1318
01:18:24.039 --> 01:18:26.082
(WHIMPERING)

1319
01:19:04.872 --> 01:19:06.456
Boil.

1320
01:19:12.296 --> 01:19:13.671
Boil!

1321
01:19:22.681 --> 01:19:25.141
Can you hear me, boil?

1322
01:19:33.192 --> 01:19:37.612
Where has he hidden the briefcase?

1323
01:21:15.836 --> 01:21:18.238
BAGLEY: The world is in danger, Julia.

1324
01:21:18.338 --> 01:21:20.658
The greed is out of control.

1325
01:21:20.758 --> 01:21:22.868
Greed is abolishing the future.

1326
01:21:22.968 --> 01:21:25.579
It's turning truth
inside out and upside down.


1327
01:21:25.679 --> 01:21:28.666
And this is its poisonous mouthpiece.

1328
01:21:28.766 --> 01:21:31.960
Oh, Christ, I think I've woken him up.
I'll have to be quick.


1329
01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:35.506
What I have to explain
is the mechanics of a holocaust.


1330
01:21:35.606 --> 01:21:38.509
And I'm not talking
about atom bombs, darling.


1331
01:21:38.609 --> 01:21:40.219
I'm talking about hamburgers.

1332
01:21:40.319 --> 01:21:41.887
(GASPS)

1333
01:21:41.987 --> 01:21:45.933
I had a nasty feeling
I was going to have to wake up to this.


1334
01:21:46.033 --> 01:21:47.851
If I was you, Julia, 
I'd turn this off.

1335
01:21:47.951 --> 01:21:50.854
- It's only going to upset you.
- You see what a nightmare I'm in.


1336
01:21:50.954 --> 01:21:53.273
You see why I can't talk to you.

1337
01:21:53.373 --> 01:21:56.151
- Who are you talking to, then?
- God, it converses!


1338
01:21:56.251 --> 01:21:59.279
- I'm talking to it.
- I need a cigarette.


1339
01:21:59.379 --> 01:22:02.157
- Be silent, you Moloch.
- Moloch?


1340
01:22:02.257 --> 01:22:04.660
Yes, yes, you, you Moloch, you bogey!

1341
01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:07.788
If you insist we have to listen
to this bullshit, I need a cigarette.


1342
01:22:07.888 --> 01:22:10.499
All right, I'll get you one,
but on one condition.


1343
01:22:10.599 --> 01:22:13.627
That you keep quiet
while you're smoking it.


1344
01:22:13.727 --> 01:22:17.188
Don't turn off, darling.

1345
01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:34.231
Penny said you had a bad dream.

1346
01:22:34.331 --> 01:22:37.609
Did she? Well, she shouldn't have.

1347
01:22:37.709 --> 01:22:39.737
She said the boil had spoken to you.

1348
01:22:39.837 --> 01:22:42.656
It didn't. Believe me, it didn't.

1349
01:22:42.756 --> 01:22:45.951
- It told me where you'd hidden the case.
- It didn't.


1350
01:22:46.051 --> 01:22:48.954
I told you where I'd put the briefcase.

1351
01:22:49.054 --> 01:22:50.539
I didn't dare wake up and ask

1352
01:22:50.639 --> 01:22:54.418
why you decided to vacuum clean me
in the middle of the night.


1353
01:22:54.518 --> 01:22:56.336
I told you where I'd put the case

1354
01:22:56.436 --> 01:23:00.174
because I'm all too aware of the tension
you've been trying to conceal.


1355
01:23:00.274 --> 01:23:02.760
And, painful though it is for me,

1356
01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:06.054
I thought by letting you
discover the film for yourself,


1357
01:23:06.154 --> 01:23:09.349
it would have some sort
of therapeutic effect.


1358
01:23:09.449 --> 01:23:13.353
There'd be no more secrets,
nothing left to hide.


1359
01:23:13.453 --> 01:23:16.330
I realise, of course, that was foolish.

1360
01:23:18.083 --> 01:23:21.945
If the boil didn't speak to me,
how did I know the combination?


1361
01:23:22.045 --> 01:23:24.547
Because it's written up in the kitchen.

1362
01:23:26.216 --> 01:23:28.243
It's been on the bulletin board
for weeks.


1363
01:23:28.343 --> 01:23:30.788
You must have seen it 200 times.

1364
01:23:30.888 --> 01:23:33.332
I never noticed noticing it.

1365
01:23:33.432 --> 01:23:38.019
It's on a red and white receipt.
I'll go and get it, if you like.


1366
01:23:43.984 --> 01:23:46.094
I realise I've been very selfish.

1367
01:23:46.194 --> 01:23:48.472
So busy thinking
of the stress I was under,


1368
01:23:48.572 --> 01:23:52.059
I'd completely forgotten
what a terrible time it's been for you.


1369
01:23:52.159 --> 01:23:54.645
I really don't want you
to watch this, darling.


1370
01:23:54.745 --> 01:23:58.982
I intended to burn it.
It's only going to upset you.


1371
01:23:59.082 --> 01:24:01.360
I'm already upset.

1372
01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.195
Please be quiet.

1373
01:24:03.295 --> 01:24:06.156
Are you there? 
I pray you're there.

1374
01:24:06.256 --> 01:24:10.577
I've just seen you in the kitchen.
I know you think I'm crazy,


1375
01:24:10.677 --> 01:24:12.204
but in a minute, 
I'll show you my film

1376
01:24:12.304 --> 01:24:15.207
and you can judge
my madness for yourself.


1377
01:24:15.307 --> 01:24:17.709
Everything's assembled from my old ads.

1378
01:24:17.809 --> 01:24:22.840
All I've done is re-edit them,
re-voice them and put in the truth.


1379
01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:24.842
No truth ever gets out of here.

1380
01:24:24.942 --> 01:24:27.094
They've got this bastard by the balls.

1381
01:24:27.194 --> 01:24:31.056
Greed has installed its lackeys
into the highest offices in this land,


1382
01:24:31.156 --> 01:24:34.476
and they're conducting
a crime wave of unprecedented ferocity.


1383
01:24:34.576 --> 01:24:36.270
Anywhere you want
to look, they're at it.


1384
01:24:36.370 --> 01:24:38.939
Oil companies sold
as champions of the environment.


1385
01:24:39.039 --> 01:24:41.817
Wild animals prancing
through the woodlands.


1386
01:24:41.917 --> 01:24:45.737
Meanwhile, the filth from their cars
is wiping out half the forests of Europe.


1387
01:24:45.837 --> 01:24:48.615
- I can't listen to any more of this.
- You swore you'd be quiet!


1388
01:24:48.715 --> 01:24:50.993
Yeah, but I'd forgotten
what a nightmare you are.


1389
01:24:51.093 --> 01:24:53.078
I want to be heard. 
I want to be heard!

1390
01:24:53.178 --> 01:24:55.930
- I want a drink.
- Then get it yourself.


1391
01:24:56.765 --> 01:24:58.750
Jesus, I've forgotten
what I was going to say.


1392
01:24:58.850 --> 01:25:01.086
I believe you were about to explain

1393
01:25:01.186 --> 01:25:04.798
why hamburgers are going
to be the cause of World War III.


1394
01:25:04.898 --> 01:25:07.384
That's right, you cynical bastard.

1395
01:25:07.484 --> 01:25:10.137
- We're all ears.
- How can you argue with the television?


1396
01:25:10.237 --> 01:25:14.391
Because this poor, sick creature
with a box on his head was me.


1397
01:25:14.491 --> 01:25:16.518
I know exactly what I'm going to say.

1398
01:25:16.618 --> 01:25:20.856
BOTH: Destruction of the rainforests
by, amongst other things, hamburgers,


1399
01:25:20.956 --> 01:25:25.319
is going to lead to a world commodity crisis,
and the commodity will be oxygen.


1400
01:25:25.419 --> 01:25:29.156
- What mad bollocks.
- It is not mad bollocks.


1401
01:25:29.256 --> 01:25:31.241
They're turning rainforests
into deserts.


1402
01:25:31.341 --> 01:25:36.038
Within 25 years, the Brazilians
will be fixing oxygen prices


1403
01:25:36.138 --> 01:25:39.291
in exactly the same way
as the Arabs fix the price for oil.


1404
01:25:39.391 --> 01:25:42.419
- No more!
- You want the air, you pay for it.


1405
01:25:42.519 --> 01:25:44.338
- No more!
- Leave it on, Dennis!


1406
01:25:44.438 --> 01:25:46.757
I want to watch the film!

1407
01:25:46.857 --> 01:25:49.259
I don't know how you can say that.

1408
01:25:49.359 --> 01:25:52.679
You know what this does to me,
reliving this nightmare?


1409
01:25:52.779 --> 01:25:56.600
Look at him. He's got a cigarette stuck
in his bandages. The man's mad.


1410
01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:59.186
Why do you keep
calling him him? It's you!


1411
01:25:59.286 --> 01:26:02.940
All right, me. It was me. 
But I was ill.

1412
01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.319
You were the one that said so.
You can't have it both ways, darling.


1413
01:26:07.419 --> 01:26:10.405
You said I needed help, and I got help,
and now I'm better,


1414
01:26:10.505 --> 01:26:13.867
which is why I can't bear
to watch this dreadful insanity.


1415
01:26:13.967 --> 01:26:17.955
Insanity?
You still want to sell 'em boils!


1416
01:26:18.055 --> 01:26:21.291
Nothing crazy about that.
It's a free market.


1417
01:26:21.391 --> 01:26:23.669
People will either buy
or they won't buy.


1418
01:26:23.769 --> 01:26:28.256
Nobody's forcing them.
Everyone knows what they're getting.


1419
01:26:28.356 --> 01:26:30.801
- Perhaps they don't.
- Of course they do.


1420
01:26:30.901 --> 01:26:33.136
People might be a bit greedy
from time to time,


1421
01:26:33.236 --> 01:26:35.931
but we're not blind,
we've got our eyes open.


1422
01:26:36.031 --> 01:26:38.016
- We have a choice.
- Perhaps.


1423
01:26:38.116 --> 01:26:41.687
Stop saying perhaps!
What's perhaps got to do with it?


1424
01:26:41.787 --> 01:26:43.897
Perhaps they don't.

1425
01:26:43.997 --> 01:26:46.441
Perhaps if they'd hanged Jesus Christ,

1426
01:26:46.541 --> 01:26:49.736
we'd all be kneeling
in front of a fucking gibbet!


1427
01:26:49.836 --> 01:26:51.863
That isn't the real world.

1428
01:26:51.963 --> 01:26:54.282
In the real world, 
I have a choice.

1429
01:26:54.382 --> 01:26:56.660
Do I want it, or don't I?

1430
01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:00.221
And in this case,
I most certainly do not.


1431
01:27:18.156 --> 01:27:21.435
JULIA: "I thought leaving you
was going to be so difficult.


1432
01:27:21.535 --> 01:27:25.605
"But the impossible becomes easy
when you have no choice.


1433
01:27:25.705 --> 01:27:29.443
"I want something better now
that can't be bought.


1434
01:27:29.543 --> 01:27:33.113
"I want a better world
than yours is, Dennis.


1435
01:27:33.213 --> 01:27:34.740
"I'm not gonna try and explain it,

1436
01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:37.842
"because I know you couldn't
possibly understand.


1437
01:27:39.511 --> 01:27:42.289
"Goodbye. Julia."

1438
01:27:42.389 --> 01:27:44.807
God, how can you be so naive?

1439
01:27:46.268 --> 01:27:49.046
Everything you've ever
looked at was yours.


1440
01:27:49.146 --> 01:27:50.964
What more could you possibly want?

1441
01:27:51.064 --> 01:27:54.301
- BAGLEY: The truth.
- Shut up, you dozy scab!


1442
01:27:54.401 --> 01:27:56.928
I thought you were dead.

1443
01:27:57.028 --> 01:27:59.681
BAGLEY: Not for nothing, cos she's free.

1444
01:27:59.781 --> 01:28:03.143
You lose. You lose.

1445
01:28:03.243 --> 01:28:04.785
Oh, no I don't.

1446
01:28:05.912 --> 01:28:09.191
You're talking
to Dennis Dimbleby Bagley.


1447
01:28:09.291 --> 01:28:11.860
And let me tell you something, boil.

1448
01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.030
She's got nowhere to go.

1449
01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:17.657
We're living in a shop.

1450
01:28:17.757 --> 01:28:21.703
The world is one magnificent
fucking shop,


1451
01:28:21.803 --> 01:28:26.333
and if it hasn't got a price tag,
it isn't worth having.


1452
01:28:26.433 --> 01:28:29.503
There is no greater freedom
than freedom of choice,


1453
01:28:29.603 --> 01:28:32.047
and that's the difference
between you and me, boil.


1454
01:28:32.147 --> 01:28:35.967
I was brought up to believe in that,
and so should you, but you don't.


1455
01:28:36.067 --> 01:28:39.721
You don't want freedom, do you?
You don't even want roads.


1456
01:28:39.821 --> 01:28:43.558
God, I never want to go on
another train as long as I live.


1457
01:28:43.658 --> 01:28:46.311
Roads represent
a fundamental right of man


1458
01:28:46.411 --> 01:28:49.314
to have access
to the good things in life.


1459
01:28:49.414 --> 01:28:53.652
Without roads, established family favourites
would become elitist delicacies.


1460
01:28:53.752 --> 01:28:56.404
A pot of soup
would be for the few.

1461
01:28:56.504 --> 01:29:01.159
There'd be no more tea bags,
no instant potatoes, no long-life cream.


1462
01:29:01.259 --> 01:29:04.538
There'd be no aerosols.
Detergents would vanish.


1463
01:29:04.638 --> 01:29:09.042
So would tinned spaghetti
and baked beans with six frankfurters.


1464
01:29:09.142 --> 01:29:12.796
The right to smoke one's
chosen brand would be denied.


1465
01:29:12.896 --> 01:29:16.633
Chewing gum would probably disappear.
So would pork pies.


1466
01:29:16.733 --> 01:29:20.470
Foot deodorisers would climax
without hope of replacement.


1467
01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:24.432
When the hydrolysed protein and
monosodium glutamate reserves ran out,


1468
01:29:24.532 --> 01:29:27.060
food would rot in its packets.

1469
01:29:27.160 --> 01:29:29.729
Jesus Christ,
there wouldn't be any more packets.


1470
01:29:29.829 --> 01:29:32.732
Packaging would vanish
from the face of the earth.


1471
01:29:32.832 --> 01:29:35.110
But worst of all,
there'd be no more cars.


1472
01:29:35.210 --> 01:29:38.113
And more than anything,
people love their cars.


1473
01:29:38.213 --> 01:29:41.491
They have a right to them.
If they have to sweat all day


1474
01:29:41.591 --> 01:29:45.287
in some stinking factory making
disposable lighters or Christmas trees,


1475
01:29:45.387 --> 01:29:47.497
by Christ, they're entitled to them.

1476
01:29:47.597 --> 01:29:50.292
They're entitled to
any innovation technology brings,


1477
01:29:50.392 --> 01:29:53.003
whether it's ten per cent more of it
or 15 per cent off of it!


1478
01:29:53.103 --> 01:29:54.504
They're entitled to it.

1479
01:29:54.604 --> 01:29:57.966
They're entitled to one
of four important new ingredients.


1480
01:29:58.066 --> 01:30:01.511
Why should anyone have to clean their
teeth without important new ingredients?


1481
01:30:01.611 --> 01:30:05.140
Why the hell shouldn't they
have their CZT?


1482
01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:09.019
How dare some snotty Marxist carbuncle
presume to deny them it?


1483
01:30:09.119 --> 01:30:11.479
They love their CZT!

1484
01:30:11.579 --> 01:30:14.524
They want it! They need it!
They positively adore it!


1485
01:30:14.624 --> 01:30:17.986
By Christ, while I've got air
in my body, they're going to get it!


1486
01:30:18.086 --> 01:30:23.200
They're gonna get it bigger
and brighter and better!


1487
01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:27.037
I'll put CZT in their
margarine if necessary,


1488
01:30:27.137 --> 01:30:29.581
shove vitamins in their toilet rolls.

1489
01:30:29.681 --> 01:30:31.833
If happiness means the whole world

1490
01:30:31.933 --> 01:30:34.711
standing on a double layer
of foot deodorisers,


1491
01:30:34.811 --> 01:30:38.340
I, Bagley, will see that they get them!

1492
01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:42.093
I'll give them anything
and everything they want!


1493
01:30:42.193 --> 01:30:44.512
By God, I will!

1494
01:30:44.612 --> 01:30:46.932
I shall not cease

1495
01:30:47.032 --> 01:30:50.644
till Jerusalem is builded here

1496
01:30:50.744 --> 01:30:55.372
on England's green and pleasant land!
