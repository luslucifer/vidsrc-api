- All right, then.

00:00:26.562 --> 00:00:28.353
Where were we?

5
00:00:28.437 --> 00:00:29.581
Oh, yeah, that's right.

6
00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:30.770
Now I remember.

7
00:00:31.604 --> 00:00:34.021
"A note about witches."

8
00:00:34.104 --> 00:00:36.229
See, here's the
thing about them.


9
00:00:36.312 --> 00:00:38.395
They're real!

10
00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:43.146
Witches are as real
as a rock in your shoe.


11
00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:45.729
That's the first thing
you need to know.


12
00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.979
The second thing
you need to know,


13
00:00:49.062 --> 00:00:51.896
they're here!

14
00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.021
And they live amongst us...

side by side, with humans.

17
00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:01.937
In every big city,
in every small town.


18
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.312
For all you know,

19
00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:07.331
a witch might be living right

20
00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:10.312
next door to you right now.

21
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.854
They everywhere!

22
00:01:13.937 --> 00:01:16.437
A witch might be a nurse,

23
00:01:17.021 --> 00:01:19.663
or your teacher, and you can bet

24
00:01:19.687 --> 00:01:23.188
your sweet patootie

25
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.770
that friendly, little
old lady on the bus

offering you a delicious piece

27
00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:32.270
of salt water taffy is a witch.

28
00:01:32.353 --> 00:01:34.229
And here's the
most important thing.


29
00:01:34.312 --> 00:01:36.687
The most important thing.

30
00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.062
Witches hate children!

31
00:01:42.146 --> 00:01:44.104
A witch spends all her time

32
00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:47.729
thinking up ways
to destroy children.


33
00:01:47.812 --> 00:01:49.604
That's all she thinks about.

34
00:01:49.687 --> 00:01:52.770
"How will I squish
this horrible child?"


35

[squishing]

36
00:01:54.353 --> 00:01:56.456
A witch gets the same pleasure

37
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.604
from squishing a child

38
00:01:58.687 --> 00:02:02.104

[older Hero] My story begins

44

during the last month of 1968.

45
00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.312
Believe it or not, I
was once a young boy.

[older Hero]

51
00:02:45.563 --> 00:02:46.563
We lived in Chicago.

52
00:02:46.645 --> 00:02:49.229
And it snows a lot
at Christmastime.

gonna be all right.

I'm gonna take you home.

A tough lady with a big heart.

00:04:55.854 --> 00:04:57.562
The kind that wouldn't hesitate

101

to give a spanking
if you deserve it


102

or a big ol' hug
if you needed it.

[Grandma] I reckon...

you'll be comfy here.

We'll get you situated tomorrow.

what is wrong with you?

Sitting in here all
by your lonesome.

It's nice out.

121
00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.312
You want something to eat?

122
00:06:25.395 --> 00:06:28.979
I just fried some wings.

123
00:06:29.062 --> 00:06:30.477
Nobody turns down my wings.

124
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:31.937

Feel that you can't go on

128
00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:21.604
Because all of
your hope Is gone


129

And your life is filled

With much confusion

What you waiting for?

Don't feel like eating.

143
00:08:06.437 --> 00:08:08.164
And I don't feel like wasting

all this good food.

- What, you think I'm supposed
- to feel sorry for you?

Well, I don't.

Do I feel bad?

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:16.479
Yeah.

149
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.312
But not sorry.

- Sometimes, whatever the good
- Lord needs to teach us

Comes in ways we don't see.

152

But it doesn't mean
we're not supposed

to learn something.

for her to be here right now.

But the Man Above
had another plan for her.

And whether it seems
fair to me or not,

it doesn't matter.

161

Sometimes life isn't fair.

162
00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:51.854
It's a hard lesson
for folks to learn


163
00:08:51.937 --> 00:08:53.560
and most people don't have to

learn it this young.

00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:29.104
even our chores.

338
00:16:29.188 --> 00:16:32.229
But Alice was a lollygagger.

339
00:16:32.312 --> 00:16:34.437
Alice, quit lollygagging, girl.

340
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.437
It's almost suppertime.

341
00:16:38.937 --> 00:16:40.562
[steam hisses]

342
00:16:51.353 --> 00:16:53.227
[Grandma] Alice did something

343
00:16:53.251 --> 00:16:55.146
no child should ever do.

344
00:16:55.229 --> 00:16:57.353
She took candy from a stranger.

345
00:16:57.437 --> 00:16:59.437
[ominous music playing]

346
00:17:00.812 --> 00:17:03.164
I got so scared,
I tore out of there


347
00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.038
like greased lightning,
and hightailed it


348
00:17:04.062 --> 00:17:05.854
straight home.

349
00:17:07.479 --> 00:17:10.437
I never should
have left Alice alone.


350
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.270
I knew I shouldn't have.

351
00:17:12.353 --> 00:17:14.520
But I was so scared.

352
00:17:15.729 --> 00:17:17.146
Later that night,

353
00:17:17.937 --> 00:17:20.645
when I saw Alice alive,

354
00:17:20.729 --> 00:17:22.810
I was as happy as a mouse

355
00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:24.937
in a bucket of cheese.

356
00:17:25.812 --> 00:17:27.896
But the very next morning,

357
00:17:27.979 --> 00:17:30.645
all that happiness went away

358
00:17:30.729 --> 00:17:32.937
because it happened.

359
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.165
- [whispers]
- She started turning.


360
00:17:48.896 --> 00:17:50.229
[shrieks]

361
00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.854
[clucking]

[clucking]

[crows]

365
00:18:11.729 --> 00:18:13.852
Alice was chicken-afied.

366
00:18:13.876 --> 00:18:16.021
Chicken-alified.

367
00:18:16.104 --> 00:18:18.104
[clucking continues]

368
00:18:19.687 --> 00:18:20.812
Lordy!

369
00:18:20.896 --> 00:18:23.229
Look at the size
of that chicken.


370
00:18:23.312 --> 00:18:25.146
Y'all seen where
Alice run off to?


371
00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:29.312
She's right... there.

372
00:18:29.395 --> 00:18:31.104
[woman] What you
talking about, child?


373
00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:32.604
Where'd she go?

374
00:18:32.687 --> 00:18:35.229
[Grandma] I tried to
explain what I saw,


375
00:18:35.312 --> 00:18:36.977
but everybody was looking

376
00:18:37.001 --> 00:18:38.687
at me like I was crazy.

377
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:41.979
Finally, I just
shut up about it.


378
00:18:42.062 --> 00:18:44.872
Although, I made it
a point to visit Alice


379
00:18:44.896 --> 00:18:46.270
in her coop every day.

380
00:18:48.479 --> 00:18:50.062
[chicken groans]

381
00:18:50.146 --> 00:18:51.146
Hi, Alice.

382
00:18:51.229 --> 00:18:53.021
[clucking]

383
00:18:57.729 --> 00:19:00.146
[Grandma] Alice even laid eggs.

384
00:19:00.229 --> 00:19:02.270
Big green ones.

385
00:19:02.353 --> 00:19:05.270
Biggest green eggs I ever seen.

386
00:19:05.353 --> 00:19:08.104
People said they were delicious.

387
00:19:09.229 --> 00:19:10.437
What about the witch?

388
00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:11.645
What about her?

389
00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:12.854
Did she go away?

390
00:19:12.937 --> 00:19:14.188
Oh, my, no.

391
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.831
- Once a witch come
- into your life, it never...


392
00:19:16.937 --> 00:19:18.854
[thunder cracking]

393
00:19:18.937 --> 00:19:24.229
[whispers] Never...
Oh, my, Lord in Heaven.


394
00:19:25.562 --> 00:19:26.812
What am I thinking?

395
00:19:26.896 --> 00:19:29.104
I just told you we
saw a witch today.


396
00:19:29.188 --> 00:19:30.395
A witch in the grocery store.

397
00:19:30.479 --> 00:19:33.123
And what am I doing?

398
00:19:33.147 --> 00:19:33.205
Sitting here like
I'm blind in one eye


399
00:19:33.229 --> 00:19:36.312
and can't see out the other,

400
00:19:36.395 --> 00:19:39.812
wasting precious
time lollygagging.


401
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.188
[thunder continues rumbling]

402
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.645
[older Hero] Always wondered

403
00:19:45.729 --> 00:19:48.854
what Grandma kept
in that locked closet.


404
00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:51.019
Turns out it was full of

405
00:19:51.043 --> 00:19:54.540
medicinal herbs and
elixirs, and old books


406
00:19:54.564 --> 00:19:55.896
about ancient healing.

407
00:19:58.062 --> 00:20:01.415
Now, my mom always
said Grandma was sort of


408
00:20:01.439 --> 00:20:02.854
a country-type healer.

409
00:20:02.937 --> 00:20:05.146
But now I was starting to think

410
00:20:05.229 --> 00:20:08.854
she might be a voodoo priestess.

411
00:20:08.937 --> 00:20:10.395
Child, we need to leave.

412
00:20:10.479 --> 00:20:11.914
-Leave?

413
00:20:11.938 --> 00:20:13.395
-That's right, leave.

414
00:20:13.479 --> 00:20:14.729
It's not safe for us here.

415
00:20:14.812 --> 00:20:16.104
But where we gonna go?

416
00:20:18.146 --> 00:20:20.062
I'll call my cousin, Eston.

417
00:20:20.146 --> 00:20:21.729
Have him make a
reservation for us


418
00:20:21.812 --> 00:20:24.188
at the Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel.


419
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.390
- He was the executive chef
- there for over 30 years.


420
00:20:26.437 --> 00:20:27.873
- He's got pull there.
- [chuckles]


421
00:20:27.979 --> 00:20:29.729
He's a star.

422
00:20:31.479 --> 00:20:33.937
His cooking put that
hotel on the map.


423
00:20:34.021 --> 00:20:35.415
It's the swankiest resort

424
00:20:35.439 --> 00:20:36.854
in all of Alabama.

425
00:20:36.937 --> 00:20:38.164
You'll be telling your grandkids

426
00:20:38.188 --> 00:20:40.146
about your stay in this hotel.

427
00:20:40.229 --> 00:20:42.979
[Hero] How do you
know we'll be safe there?


428
00:20:43.062 --> 00:20:44.956
Because, child, ain't nothing

429
00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.977
but rich white folks
at the Grand Orleans


430
00:20:47.001 --> 00:20:48.229
Imperial Island Hotel.

431
00:20:48.312 --> 00:20:50.562
And witches only
prey on the poor,


432
00:20:50.645 --> 00:20:53.520
the overlooked,
the kids they think


433
00:20:53.604 --> 00:20:54.913
- nobody's gonna make a fuss
- about if they go missing.


434
00:20:54.937 --> 00:20:56.021
Go pack!

435
00:21:04.562 --> 00:21:05.893
[Hero] Grandma, are there

436
00:21:05.917 --> 00:21:07.270
witches in every city?

437
00:21:07.353 --> 00:21:08.935
[Grandma] Every city,

438
00:21:08.959 --> 00:21:10.562
every state, every country.

439
00:21:10.645 --> 00:21:12.437
And there's a secret
society of witches


440
00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:15.188
in every country called a coven.

441
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.852
That's just like a Rotary Club

442
00:21:16.876 --> 00:21:18.479
but for witches.

443
00:21:18.562 --> 00:21:20.270
They all get
together in one place


444
00:21:20.353 --> 00:21:22.353
and gossip about
who they put spells on,


445
00:21:22.437 --> 00:21:24.770
or trade potion
secrets, and whatnot.


446
00:21:24.854 --> 00:21:27.747
But most important,
they receive orders


447
00:21:27.771 --> 00:21:29.270
from the Grand High Witch.

448
00:21:29.353 --> 00:21:30.562
The Grand High Witch?

449
00:21:30.645 --> 00:21:32.729
The Grand High Witch, yeah.

450
00:21:32.812 --> 00:21:35.146
She's the ruler of them all.

451
00:21:35.229 --> 00:21:37.479
All-powerful, pure evil,

452
00:21:37.562 --> 00:21:39.687
and without a stitch of mercy.

453
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:42.312
Yeah. Legend has
it, she was hatched


454
00:21:42.395 --> 00:21:44.562
on the frozen tundra of Norway.

455
00:21:45.645 --> 00:21:47.520
Now, take a look at that.

456
00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:10.080
What, you just gonna stand there

457
00:22:10.104 --> 00:22:11.604
and stare at me all day?

458
00:22:11.687 --> 00:22:13.270
Can I help you?

459
00:22:13.353 --> 00:22:14.851
You can unload this car while

460
00:22:14.875 --> 00:22:16.395
I check in to this here hotel.

461
00:22:16.479 --> 00:22:17.520
Yes, ma'am.

462
00:22:17.604 --> 00:22:18.979
Here's the key.

463
00:22:21.229 --> 00:22:24.021
Oh, and... No.

464
00:22:24.104 --> 00:22:26.395
You keep your money, ma'am.

465
00:22:26.479 --> 00:22:28.312
And enjoy yourself.

466
00:22:28.395 --> 00:22:30.645
I think I will.

467
00:22:30.729 --> 00:22:33.206
- [older Hero] Grandma was right
- About this hotel.


468
00:22:33.312 --> 00:22:35.104
It sure was fancy.

469
00:22:35.188 --> 00:22:37.395
She brought us to
the Gulf of Mexico


470
00:22:37.479 --> 00:22:39.437
to get away from that witch.

471
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.956
But she had no idea what

472
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.437
we were about to step into.

473
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.229
[Daisy sniffing]

474
00:22:46.312 --> 00:22:48.123
- [whispers]
- Be careful with the mouse.


475
00:22:49.229 --> 00:22:50.663
- -[man] No.
- -[woman] For God's sake,


476
00:22:50.687 --> 00:22:51.997
- I think you're being
- extremely unreasonable.


477
00:22:52.021 --> 00:22:53.413
- [man] No, Deidre.
- For the last time,


478
00:22:53.437 --> 00:22:54.746
I will not have that
woman in my house.


479
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:55.830
[woman] Oh, she's
very good company.


480
00:22:55.854 --> 00:22:57.021
[man] Absolutely not, Deidre.

481
00:22:57.104 --> 00:22:58.479
[woman] Oh, for God's sake,

482
00:22:58.562 --> 00:23:00.937
Bruno, your face.

483
00:23:01.021 --> 00:23:03.270
Obviously can't
take you anywhere.


484
00:23:06.312 --> 00:23:07.331
[receptionist]

485
00:23:07.355 --> 00:23:08.395
Here you are, ma'am.

486
00:23:15.021 --> 00:23:16.604
Come on, we got our key.

487
00:23:16.687 --> 00:23:19.687
We are in room 766.

488
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.479
[Hero] Sounds like a good room.

489
00:23:21.562 --> 00:23:23.812
[Grandma coughing]

490
00:23:23.896 --> 00:23:25.706
- -You okay, Grandma?
- -[coughs]


491
00:23:25.812 --> 00:23:27.229
That's the first
time you coughed


492
00:23:27.312 --> 00:23:28.395
since we left the house.

493
00:23:28.479 --> 00:23:30.330
- -Can I help you, madam?
- -[coughs]


494
00:23:30.437 --> 00:23:33.104
Oh! You must be Eston's cousins.

495
00:23:33.188 --> 00:23:36.229
Yes, he insisted that
you stay in room 766.


496
00:23:36.312 --> 00:23:37.604
That's the Magnolia.

497
00:23:37.687 --> 00:23:39.373
This is one of

498
00:23:39.397 --> 00:23:41.104
our most lovely junior suites.

499
00:23:41.188 --> 00:23:43.270
[Grandma chuckles]

500
00:23:43.353 --> 00:23:46.479
And aren't you a
lucky fella? Hmm?


501
00:23:47.188 --> 00:23:48.663
It's not every day that
a young gentleman


502
00:23:48.687 --> 00:23:50.229
such as yourself is fortunate

503
00:23:50.312 --> 00:23:51.893
to come and stay in such

504
00:23:51.917 --> 00:23:54.687
a fine hotel as this now, is it?

505
00:23:55.729 --> 00:23:57.021
Come on, Gatsby.

506
00:23:57.104 --> 00:23:58.188
Let's go.

507
00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.479
Let's go find our room.

508
00:23:59.562 --> 00:24:00.937
Would you like me to show you?

509
00:24:01.021 --> 00:24:02.746
- -It's on the fourth floor.
- -[Grandma] Mmm.


510
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:04.747
- [Hero] Grandma,
- if we're on the fourth floor,


511
00:24:04.854 --> 00:24:06.479
Why is it number 7-6-6?

512
00:24:06.562 --> 00:24:08.830
- Because the man who built
- this hotel was a numerologist.


513
00:24:08.854 --> 00:24:10.687
He believed numbers
have meaning.


514
00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:12.854
I know a little something
about numbers.


515
00:24:12.937 --> 00:24:14.227
Seven and six together

516
00:24:14.251 --> 00:24:15.562
means a test is coming.

517
00:24:15.645 --> 00:24:17.604
Two sixes mean abundance.

518
00:24:17.687 --> 00:24:19.331
So, it look like

519
00:24:19.355 --> 00:24:21.021
a big test might be coming.

520
00:24:25.104 --> 00:24:27.353
[marching with

521
00:24:43.604 --> 00:24:45.062
Well, hello there.

522
00:24:45.146 --> 00:24:47.770
The Grand Orleans
Imperial Island Hotel


523

525
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.165
Uh, I would just like to say

526
00:24:54.189 --> 00:24:55.997
that we applaud
your innumerable,


527
00:24:56.021 --> 00:24:57.770

And, um...

530
00:25:08.812 --> 00:25:11.831
I'm sorry, madam,
but the hotel has


531
00:25:11.855 --> 00:25:13.562
a very strict no-pet policy.

532
00:25:13.645 --> 00:25:15.830
- [with Eastern European accent]
- You seem like the sort of man


533
00:25:15.854 --> 00:25:17.520
Who loves a precious.

534
00:25:17.604 --> 00:25:18.937
Don't you, Mister...

535
00:25:19.021 --> 00:25:21.747
- Stringer. R. J. Stringer III.
- Hotel Manager.


536
00:25:21.854 --> 00:25:23.770
Thank you for
making an exception,


537
00:25:23.854 --> 00:25:25.329
- -Mr. R. J. The Hotel Manager.
- -Stringer.


538
00:25:25.353 --> 00:25:26.560
Yes, but I haven't yet...

539
00:25:26.584 --> 00:25:27.812
But I didn't agree...

540
00:25:27.896 --> 00:25:30.562
So, tell me something, Mister...

541
00:25:31.479 --> 00:25:33.165
- -Stringy?
- -Stringer.


542
00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:34.520
Hotel man.

543
00:25:34.604 --> 00:25:35.664
- -Manager.
- -The third.


544
00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.081
-Yeah.

545
00:25:37.105 --> 00:25:38.437
-I know you love kitties.

-[chuckles uneasily]

548
00:25:40.645 --> 00:25:46.520
But what do you
think of... mice?


549
00:25:46.604 --> 00:25:47.604
Mice?

550
00:25:47.645 --> 00:25:50.604
Yeah. Mice.

551
00:25:50.687 --> 00:25:53.896
What would you
do if there were mice


552
00:25:53.979 --> 00:25:56.562
running all around
in this hotel?


553
00:25:56.645 --> 00:25:59.122
Well, I can assure you,
madam, there would


554
00:25:59.146 --> 00:26:01.062
never be any mice...

555
00:26:01.146 --> 00:26:02.852
[shushes] But if there were?

556
00:26:02.876 --> 00:26:04.604
Hypothetically?

557
00:26:04.687 --> 00:26:07.229
Mmm. Oh, hypothetically.

558
00:26:07.312 --> 00:26:09.979
Yes, I suppose,
well, I would, uh...


559
00:26:10.062 --> 00:26:11.604
I would call the exterminator.

560
00:26:12.104 --> 00:26:13.479
Exactly!

561
00:26:14.312 --> 00:26:16.896
You see, girls?

562
00:26:16.979 --> 00:26:20.562
He would call the exterminator!

563
00:26:20.645 --> 00:26:23.789
Just like any normal
human with his head


564
00:26:23.813 --> 00:26:26.831
screwed on right,
he would exterminate


565
00:26:26.855 --> 00:26:28.812
those brats.

566
00:26:29.604 --> 00:26:32.437
Uh... Rats.

567
00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.687
We would exterminate the rats.

568
00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.270
[Grandma] Evil.

569
00:26:39.353 --> 00:26:40.520
[thunder crashing]

570
00:26:40.604 --> 00:26:41.913
There's no other
way to describe them.


571
00:26:41.937 --> 00:26:44.104
Pure, unvarnished evil.

572
00:26:44.188 --> 00:26:46.437
That's what witches are.

573
00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.956
-[thunder cracking]

574
00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.437
-[Grandma coughing]

575
00:26:53.562 --> 00:26:55.496
- [hoarsely] Now, you see
- this here cough of mine?


576
00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.479
It was likely brought
on by a witch.


577
00:26:57.562 --> 00:26:59.747
- Probably that one you saw
- in the grocery store.


578
00:26:59.854 --> 00:27:02.104
Really? A witch can
make you cough?


579
00:27:02.188 --> 00:27:04.854
Oh, you bet your
sweet patootie they can.


580
00:27:04.937 --> 00:27:06.810
Grandma, how can
you tell a real witch from


581
00:27:06.834 --> 00:27:08.729
a normal lady?

582
00:27:08.812 --> 00:27:10.789
Well, first of all, witches

583
00:27:10.813 --> 00:27:12.812
aren't really women at all.

584
00:27:12.896 --> 00:27:15.729
They're demons in human shape.

585
00:27:15.812 --> 00:27:18.229
That's why if you
look closely at a witch,


586
00:27:18.312 --> 00:27:19.956
you'll notice the corners

587
00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:21.645
of her mouth is elongated,

588
00:27:21.729 --> 00:27:23.395
stretching almost
up to her ears,


589
00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:25.019
and that's usually hidden

590
00:27:25.043 --> 00:27:26.604
with pancake makeup.

591
00:27:26.687 --> 00:27:28.477
And a real witch always

592
00:27:28.501 --> 00:27:30.312
wears gloves. Always.

593
00:27:30.395 --> 00:27:33.520
Because a real witch
doesn't have hands.


594
00:27:33.604 --> 00:27:34.604
She's got claws.

595
00:27:34.687 --> 00:27:35.729
[Hero] Claws?

596
00:27:35.812 --> 00:27:38.229
[thunder cracking]

597
00:27:38.312 --> 00:27:40.937
And they don't have toes. Ooh.

598
00:27:41.021 --> 00:27:42.395
Their ugly feet look like

599
00:27:42.479 --> 00:27:45.229
their toes got chopped
off with an axe.


600
00:27:45.312 --> 00:27:47.479
And all witches are bald.

601
00:27:47.562 --> 00:27:49.854
As bald as a boiled egg.

602
00:27:49.937 --> 00:27:51.229
So, they wear wigs.

603
00:27:51.312 --> 00:27:53.437
And it gives them nasty sores.

604
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.997
"Wig rash,"

605
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:56.520
the witches call it.

606
00:27:56.604 --> 00:27:59.353
Mmm! And it makes them crazy.

607
00:27:59.437 --> 00:28:01.854
So, gloves, wigs.

608
00:28:01.937 --> 00:28:03.188
Is that everything?

609
00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:04.520
Nose-holes.

610
00:28:04.604 --> 00:28:05.644
-Nose-holes?

611
00:28:05.668 --> 00:28:06.729
-Yeah. Nostrils.

612
00:28:06.812 --> 00:28:08.520
Nose-holes.

613
00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:10.144
Witches have larger nose-holes

614
00:28:10.168 --> 00:28:11.729
than normal people.

615
00:28:11.812 --> 00:28:14.229
When they need
to sniff out a child,


616
00:28:14.312 --> 00:28:15.729
those nose-holes can grow out

617
00:28:15.812 --> 00:28:18.520
as big as eight
inches in diameter.


618
00:28:18.604 --> 00:28:20.021
[thunder cracks]

619
00:28:20.104 --> 00:28:21.623
But, mind you, children

620
00:28:21.647 --> 00:28:23.188
smell horrible to witches.

621
00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:25.188
[Hero] Even if the
kid just had a bath?


622
00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:26.539
[chuckles]

623
00:28:26.563 --> 00:28:27.854
That makes it worse.

624
00:28:27.937 --> 00:28:29.602
A freshly clean kid smells

625
00:28:29.626 --> 00:28:31.312
like dog poop to a witch.

626
00:28:31.395 --> 00:28:32.456
-Dog poop?

627
00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.562
-That's right.

628
00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:35.353
And the cleaner the kid,

629
00:28:35.437 --> 00:28:37.104
the poopier he
smells to a witch.


630
00:28:37.188 --> 00:28:39.437
Maybe I should
stop taking baths.


631
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.645
Child, don't test me.

632
00:28:41.937 --> 00:28:43.643
Can a witch come in here

633
00:28:43.667 --> 00:28:45.395
and get us while we sleep?

634
00:28:46.188 --> 00:28:47.353
No.

635
00:28:47.937 --> 00:28:49.979
Not at all.

636
00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:52.229
Witches never
do silly things like


637
00:28:52.312 --> 00:28:54.518
climbing drainpipes or

638
00:28:54.542 --> 00:28:56.770
breaking into people's houses.

639
00:28:56.854 --> 00:29:00.270
Besides, they have
no idea where we are.


640
00:29:00.353 --> 00:29:03.353
Okay, but I'm
still a little scared.


641
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.812
Over here, come on, little man.

642
00:29:06.896 --> 00:29:08.353
There we go.

643
00:29:11.395 --> 00:29:12.854

- the sun was shining and the air was crisp

I kept quiet as a mouse

so Grandma could sleep in,

00:31:06.104 --> 00:31:08.979
Oh, mercy, I slept in late.

668
00:31:09.812 --> 00:31:11.395
Phew.

669
00:31:11.479 --> 00:31:14.123
- Well, thank you for ordering
- me breakfast, darling.


670
00:31:14.229 --> 00:31:16.789
- I gave the room service guy
- a half a dollar tip.


671
00:31:16.896 --> 00:31:18.062
Was that okay?

672
00:31:18.146 --> 00:31:19.520
That's mighty
gentlemanly of you.


673
00:31:19.604 --> 00:31:20.937
[coughs]

674
00:31:21.937 --> 00:31:23.021
Grandma, are you okay?

675
00:31:23.104 --> 00:31:24.622
- I'm fine.
- Just a little tickle.


676
00:31:24.729 --> 00:31:27.520
Grab Grandma that
glass of tea. [coughs]


677
00:31:27.604 --> 00:31:29.914
- And listen, Grandma's gonna
- take it easy today.


678
00:31:30.021 --> 00:31:32.622
- But I want you to get outside
- and run around.


679
00:31:33.729 --> 00:31:35.664
Go down to the water.

680
00:31:35.688 --> 00:31:37.645
Have fun.

681
00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:38.998
I was thinking I would do

682
00:31:39.022 --> 00:31:40.312
some training with Daisy.

683
00:31:40.395 --> 00:31:42.188
Oh! Well, take her with.

684
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.230
- Just don't let her get
- too close to the water.


685
00:31:44.312 --> 00:31:45.896
I wouldn't want some
big old sea snake


686
00:31:45.979 --> 00:31:47.104
to grab ahold of her.

687
00:31:47.188 --> 00:31:48.395
Sea snake?

688
00:31:48.479 --> 00:31:49.831
I'm just joshing.

689
00:31:49.855 --> 00:31:51.229
There ain't no sea snakes.

690
00:31:51.312 --> 00:31:53.562
You go on now. Have fun.

691
00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:55.143
And don't worry about me.

692
00:31:55.167 --> 00:31:56.687
I'm fine.

693
00:31:56.770 --> 00:31:58.229
[older Hero] Even though I knew

694
00:31:58.312 --> 00:32:00.729
Grandma was kidding
about the sea snakes,


695
00:32:00.812 --> 00:32:02.854
I didn't wanna take any chances,

696
00:32:02.937 --> 00:32:04.896
so we stayed inside.

697
00:32:04.979 --> 00:32:06.604
And wouldn't you know,

698
00:32:06.687 --> 00:32:08.081
we came upon the big ballroom

699
00:32:08.105 --> 00:32:09.520
where it turns out

700
00:32:09.604 --> 00:32:11.188
the International Society

701
00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:13.581
for the Prevention of Cruelty

702
00:32:13.605 --> 00:32:13.663
to Children folks
were gonna have


703
00:32:13.687 --> 00:32:16.270
their conference.

[door creaking]

705
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.353
Hey!

706
00:32:22.437 --> 00:32:23.896
You there!

707
00:32:23.979 --> 00:32:26.270
And what are you doing?

708
00:32:26.353 --> 00:32:27.479
Breaking and entering?

709
00:32:27.562 --> 00:32:29.062
Looking for a quiet spot.

710
00:32:29.146 --> 00:32:30.353
For what?

711
00:32:30.437 --> 00:32:31.437
Training.

712
00:32:31.479 --> 00:32:33.479
Training what?

713
00:32:34.479 --> 00:32:36.123
Cool. Super.

714
00:32:36.147 --> 00:32:37.812
What's his name?

715
00:32:37.896 --> 00:32:39.394
It's a she.

716
00:32:39.418 --> 00:32:40.937
And her name is Daisy.

717
00:32:41.021 --> 00:32:42.581
- -Can I hold her?
- -[Daisy squeaking]


718
00:32:42.687 --> 00:32:46.645
She's not too comfortable
around strangers.


719
00:32:46.729 --> 00:32:49.270
Can she do any
tricks or anything?


720
00:32:49.353 --> 00:32:51.229
We were just about
to do some training.


721
00:32:51.312 --> 00:32:52.604
Wanna watch?

722
00:32:52.687 --> 00:32:54.021
What time is it?

723
00:32:54.104 --> 00:32:55.852
A nice lady told me

724
00:32:55.876 --> 00:32:57.645
to meet her here at 12:25.

725
00:32:57.729 --> 00:32:59.394
She said she would give me

726
00:32:59.418 --> 00:33:01.104
six bars of Swiss chocolate.

727
00:33:01.188 --> 00:33:02.414
What's your name?

728
00:33:02.438 --> 00:33:03.896
I'm... Bruno Jenkins!

729
00:33:03.979 --> 00:33:06.019
- I've been looking for you
- everywhere, young man.


730
00:33:06.062 --> 00:33:08.395
Your father is furious.

731
00:33:08.479 --> 00:33:09.687
Hello, Mother.

732
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:11.437
This is my new friend.

733
00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.104
Nice to meet you.

734
00:33:13.188 --> 00:33:15.854
Look at your
hands, they're filthy!


735
00:33:15.937 --> 00:33:17.435
Look at your shirt!

736
00:33:17.459 --> 00:33:18.979
It's a complete mess!

737
00:33:19.062 --> 00:33:20.081
- -Come with me.
- -Ow!


738
00:33:20.188 --> 00:33:21.520
What have you been doing?

739
00:33:21.604 --> 00:33:24.437
Running around in
a sausage factory?


740
00:33:28.104 --> 00:33:30.062
[door creaking]

741
00:33:43.562 --> 00:33:45.979
[older Hero] The room
was completely empty.


742
00:33:46.062 --> 00:33:47.748
A perfect place for me

743
00:33:47.772 --> 00:33:49.479
and Daisy to do our training.

744
00:33:49.562 --> 00:33:52.310
And I figured, if
all the Prevention


745
00:33:52.334 --> 00:33:54.687
of Cruelty to Children
people showed up,


746
00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:56.395
they would probably look kindly

747
00:33:56.479 --> 00:33:57.955
on a young mouse
trainer who was just


748
00:33:57.979 --> 00:33:59.896
going about his business.

749
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:16.896
[clangs]

750
00:34:16.979 --> 00:34:21.021
Jeez, that scared
the crap out of me.


751
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.770
[switches clicking]

752
00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:43.687
So, here we are.

753
00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:47.937
Here is the Le Grand
Imperial Ballroom


754
00:34:48.021 --> 00:34:51.312
or Le Salon
Grande, as we call it.


755
00:34:51.395 --> 00:34:53.062
Well, actually we
call it the Mural Room


756
00:34:53.146 --> 00:34:54.663
because of all these
beautiful murals...


757
00:34:54.687 --> 00:34:56.227
I was told there is only

758
00:34:56.251 --> 00:34:57.812
one door in and out, yeah?

759
00:34:57.896 --> 00:34:59.146
Yeah. Yes.

760
00:34:59.229 --> 00:35:00.956
There's, uh, only that door

761
00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.104
there, in and out,
and which, of course,


762
00:35:04.188 --> 00:35:05.937
does not make the
fire marshal very happy.


763
00:35:06.021 --> 00:35:09.645
So, don't you go
starting any fires.


764
00:35:12.896 --> 00:35:15.021
This room will do.

765
00:35:16.021 --> 00:35:19.644
[Mr. Stringer] Right,
so... [marching with

Yeah, so, if there's any...

Is there anything
else -that you ladies...


769

-No.

- -No?
- -Bye-bye.

00:35:31.062 --> 00:35:32.395
Oh, all right.

Okay, you so-called ladies.

ran cold as I started

to get real scared.

Here I was, trapped
in a room with a bunch

of bald-headed witches!

giving all the orders,

a good look at her,

who she had to be.

This morning, I'm

809
00:39:21.896 --> 00:39:26.104
and what am I seeing? Hmm?

810
00:39:26.188 --> 00:39:28.270
[croakily] What am I seeing?

I'm seeing dozens...
I'm seeing hundreds...

I'm seeing hundreds

do you have a plan?

How can we possibly
wipe out every child?

833
00:40:56.937 --> 00:41:00.604
And in this store you will sell

834
00:41:00.687 --> 00:41:05.729
only the highest
quality, tastiest candy.


835
00:41:05.812 --> 00:41:09.937
Now, you're probably wondering,

836
00:41:10.021 --> 00:41:11.373
"Where do I get the money

837
00:41:11.397 --> 00:41:12.770
to buy a candy shop?"

838
00:41:12.854 --> 00:41:17.812
Well, I have
thought of that too.


839
00:41:17.896 --> 00:41:22.812
In my room, room number 666,

840
00:41:22.896 --> 00:41:24.437
I have a steamer trunk

841
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.937
filled with brand-new,
crisp $100 bills!


842
00:41:28.021 --> 00:41:29.729
Room 666.

[Grand High Witch]

844
00:41:32.355 --> 00:41:34.896
Remember that room number 666

845
00:41:34.979 --> 00:41:36.812
and your shops will sell

846
00:41:36.896 --> 00:41:40.604
only the highest
quality, tastiest candy.


847
00:41:44.687 --> 00:41:46.562
And...

848
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:51.353
We use Formula Number 86

849
00:41:51.437 --> 00:41:54.979
Delayed Action Mouse Maker!

850
00:41:55.062 --> 00:41:56.729
[witches] Ooh!

851
00:41:56.812 --> 00:42:00.979
One drop of Mouse
Maker in a piece of candy


852
00:42:01.062 --> 00:42:03.687
will transform
a dirty little child


853
00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:07.229
into a mouse in one hour!

854
00:42:07.312 --> 00:42:08.854
[witches] Ah!

855
00:42:08.937 --> 00:42:12.456
Two drops will
transform the disgusting


856
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.520
little brat in 30 minutes.

857
00:42:14.604 --> 00:42:18.645
And three drops
is instantaneous.


858
00:42:18.729 --> 00:42:21.479
An instant mouse!

859

860
00:42:24.395 --> 00:42:26.062
[giggling] Oh.

865

So, less than an hour ago,

866
00:42:44.812 --> 00:42:46.914
I found a repulsive smelly

867
00:42:46.938 --> 00:42:50.581
little boy in the
lobby and I gave him


868
00:42:50.605 --> 00:42:52.062
an outrageously expensive

869
00:42:52.146 --> 00:42:53.812
bar of Swiss chocolate.

870
00:42:53.896 --> 00:42:55.956
A chocolate bar

871
00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.062
that was laced with one drop

872
00:42:58.146 --> 00:42:59.645
- of my Number 86...
- Oh, no.


873
00:42:59.729 --> 00:43:01.288
- [Grand High Witch] ...Delayed

875
00:43:02.479 --> 00:43:04.229
And I told the
greedy little brat


876
00:43:04.312 --> 00:43:07.562
to meet me here at 12:25.

877
00:43:07.645 --> 00:43:10.437
So, in less than 10 minutes,

878
00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.581
all you pathetic witches will

879

What happened to us?

- There's a convention of

And they have an evil potion.

They put it in your chocolate.

My chocolate? Crikey!

They always spike the chocolate.

1023

It's standard evil
witch procedure.

I don't want to be a mouse.

about witches.

- how much white truffle costs?

Wipe it off and
put it in the sauce.

- [Grandma] Why didn't you
- say something before, darling?


1143
00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:15.604
Because it can be very dangerous

1144
00:56:15.687 --> 00:56:17.104
for a mouse to talk.

1145
00:56:17.188 --> 00:56:18.686
Most people don't understand

1146
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:20.229
and they get scared.

1147
00:56:20.312 --> 00:56:22.270
I almost said
something the other night


1148
00:56:22.353 --> 00:56:23.705
when you told the
story about Alice Blue


1149
00:56:23.729 --> 00:56:25.896
getting turned into a chicken,

1150
00:56:25.979 --> 00:56:28.021
but I thought better of it.

1151
00:56:28.104 --> 00:56:29.477
So, some wicked, evil witch

1152
00:56:29.501 --> 00:56:30.896
mouse-afied you.

1153
00:56:30.979 --> 00:56:32.687
Yes, ma'am, four months ago.

1154
00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:34.581
On the very same afternoon

1155
00:56:34.605 --> 00:56:36.437
I ran away from the orphanage.

1156
00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.729
Well, what happened
was, a kind lady...


1157
00:56:38.812 --> 00:56:40.520
Well, I thought she was kind.

1158
00:56:40.604 --> 00:56:42.979
Anyway, she offered
me a chocolate bar,


1159
00:56:43.062 --> 00:56:44.729
and before I knew it, poof!

1160
00:56:44.812 --> 00:56:46.770
I was transformed.

1161
00:56:46.854 --> 00:56:49.414
- Then, faster than a hot knife
- cuts through butter,

and sells me to a pet store

1164
00:56:52.812 --> 00:56:54.979
so he could buy food.

1165
00:56:55.062 --> 00:56:56.312
Yum!

1166
00:56:56.395 --> 00:56:58.896
I'm so sorry, Daisy.

1167
00:56:58.979 --> 00:57:01.188
Mary. Uh, my real name is Mary.

1168
00:57:01.312 --> 00:57:02.604
Mary. That's a pretty name.

1169
00:57:02.687 --> 00:57:04.104
Excuse me.

1170
00:57:04.188 --> 00:57:05.540
All this talk about food

1171
00:57:05.564 --> 00:57:06.937
is making me really hungry.

1172
00:57:07.021 --> 00:57:08.562
Can I have one of those grapes?

1173
00:57:11.729 --> 00:57:13.812
[Grandma] So, it was
the Grand High Witch,


1174
00:57:13.896 --> 00:57:15.645
and she's in this very hotel?

1175
00:57:15.729 --> 00:57:17.310
We got to do something to turn

1176
00:57:17.334 --> 00:57:18.937
you back. Make this right.

1177
00:57:19.021 --> 00:57:21.206
- The Grand High Witch
- has a room full of potion.


1178
00:57:21.312 --> 00:57:22.645
And she's gonna use it

1179
00:57:22.729 --> 00:57:24.622
- to turn every kid in the world
- into a mouse.


1180
00:57:24.729 --> 00:57:26.104
We have to help them.

- -[man] Hotel maintenance.


1183
00:57:30.062 --> 00:57:31.896
[whispers] Quick, hide.

1184
00:57:33.353 --> 00:57:36.687
Here. Hop in my knitting tote.

1185
00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:38.770
Keep your heads down.

1186
00:57:46.437 --> 00:57:47.479
Yes.

1187
00:57:47.562 --> 00:57:49.062
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am,

1188
00:57:49.146 --> 00:57:51.122
- but we got a report of
- a possible rodent infestation.


1189
00:57:51.146 --> 00:57:52.394
Rodent infestation?

1190
00:57:52.418 --> 00:57:53.687
In a hotel this expensive?

1191
00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:55.854
That's crazier than a
hog on slaughter day.


1192
00:57:55.937 --> 00:57:57.998
- Yes, ma'am.
- It's probably nothing.


1193
00:57:58.104 --> 00:57:59.645
The maid who said
she saw the rodents


1194
00:57:59.729 --> 00:58:01.914
- has a tendency to be
- a bit high-strung. [chuckles]


1195
00:58:02.021 --> 00:58:03.872
-But, to be on the
safe side, I thought


1196
00:58:03.896 --> 00:58:04.979
I'd lay these here traps,

1197
00:58:05.062 --> 00:58:06.372
- -if you don't mind.
- -Okay.


1198
00:58:06.479 --> 00:58:08.372
- -We put them in all the rooms.
- -Mmm-hmm.


1199
00:58:08.479 --> 00:58:10.812
Just to be safe.

1200
00:58:10.896 --> 00:58:14.395
So, uh, what are they? Mice?

1201
00:58:14.479 --> 00:58:15.729
Oh. No, ma'am.

1202
00:58:15.812 --> 00:58:17.123
Maid said she saw

1203
00:58:17.147 --> 00:58:18.479
a swarm of huge, ugly rats.

1204
00:58:18.562 --> 00:58:20.312
At least a dozen of them.

1205
00:58:20.395 --> 00:58:22.021
Goodness, a dozen?

1206
00:58:22.104 --> 00:58:23.604
Well, it's like I said,

1207
00:58:23.687 --> 00:58:25.143
she has a tendency to be

1208
00:58:25.167 --> 00:58:26.645
a bit high-strung. [chuckles]

1209

00:58:35.687 --> 00:58:38.021
They can't resist it.

1213
00:58:41.395 --> 00:58:43.479
[Bruno] Mmm... [grunts]

1214
00:58:43.562 --> 00:58:45.060
Anyway, you hear any

1215
00:58:45.084 --> 00:58:46.604
of these traps start snapping,

1216
00:58:46.687 --> 00:58:47.687
give me a call.

1217
00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:49.188
I sure will.

1218
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:50.520
[man] That's right.

1219
00:58:50.604 --> 00:58:52.019
Don't you know anything?

1220
00:58:52.043 --> 00:58:53.479
Grapes can hurt a mouse.

1221
00:58:53.562 --> 00:58:54.854
[Grandma] All right, you three.

1222
00:58:54.937 --> 00:58:56.770
You stay away from
those traps, you hear?


1223
00:58:56.854 --> 00:58:59.165
If we could just get our hands

1224
00:58:59.189 --> 00:58:59.246
on some of that
potion, I might be able


1225
00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:01.687
to reverse-engineer it.

1226
00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:04.456
- Make it a potion
- that turns mice into children.


1227
00:59:04.562 --> 00:59:06.060
I always travel with

1228
00:59:06.084 --> 00:59:07.604
my anti-hex herbs and salts.

1229
00:59:07.687 --> 00:59:08.977
But whoever knows where

1230
00:59:09.001 --> 00:59:10.312
that wicked, evil witch is.

1231
00:59:10.395 --> 00:59:12.812
We do. She's in room 666.

1232
00:59:12.896 --> 00:59:14.562
We heard her tell
all those witches


1233
00:59:14.645 --> 00:59:18.104
to meet her in room

1234
00:59:18.188 --> 00:59:19.770
And we're in room 766.

1235
00:59:19.854 --> 00:59:21.896
Room 666 is right below us.

1236
00:59:21.979 --> 00:59:23.270
Good Lord!

1237
00:59:23.353 --> 00:59:25.353
- That evil sorceress is living
- right beneath us?


1238
00:59:25.437 --> 00:59:27.062
Yes. And here's what we do.

1239
00:59:27.146 --> 00:59:29.081
We wait for the Grand High

1240
00:59:29.105 --> 00:59:29.164
Witch to leave her
room, then we use


1241
00:59:29.188 --> 00:59:31.021
Grandma's knitting wool

1242
00:59:31.104 --> 00:59:32.229
as a rope to lower me down

1243
00:59:32.312 --> 00:59:33.729
to the Grand High
Witch's balcony.


1244
00:59:33.812 --> 00:59:35.229
I grab a bottle of potion,

1245
00:59:35.312 --> 00:59:38.081
Grandma hoists me back up,

1246
00:59:38.105 --> 00:59:38.164
she reverses the
spell, and ta-da!


1247
00:59:38.188 --> 00:59:40.729
We're kids again.

all that up just now?

is one bottle of potion.

01:04:31.729 --> 01:04:32.812
I don't think so.

1326
01:04:32.896 --> 01:04:34.562
I have seen you before.

1327
01:04:34.645 --> 01:04:35.979
I remember your face.

1328
01:04:36.062 --> 01:04:39.188
You mighta seen me
in the lobby, maybe.


1329
01:04:39.312 --> 01:04:41.270
No, no, no, no, no.

1330
01:04:41.353 --> 01:04:42.812
Not in the lobby.

1331
01:04:42.896 --> 01:04:46.519
I remember you from...
- [doorbell dings]


1332
01:04:46.543 --> 01:04:47.937
-[yells] What? Who is it?

1333
01:04:48.021 --> 01:04:50.687
It's Mr. Stringer
III, Hotel Manager.


1334
01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:52.854
[Grand High Witch] Curses!

1335
01:04:54.812 --> 01:04:56.104
[scoffs]

1336
01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:01.455
- [Mr. Stringer]
- You want me to remove


1337
01:05:01.479 --> 01:05:02.896
The children from the beach?

1338
01:05:02.979 --> 01:05:04.621
- [Grand High Witch]
- I want them removed.


1339
01:05:04.645 --> 01:05:07.039
- [Mr. Stringer] Well, I'll...
- I'll see what I can do.


1340
01:05:07.146 --> 01:05:10.229
Madam, I procured
this, uh, for you today.


1341
01:05:10.312 --> 01:05:11.437
I thought you might like it.

1342
01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.520
It's a kitty carrier.

1343
01:05:13.604 --> 01:05:16.248
And I thought you
could put your feline


1344
01:05:16.272 --> 01:05:17.496
friend in there and
you can transport him


1345
01:05:17.520 --> 01:05:19.395
all over the hotel,

1346
01:05:19.479 --> 01:05:22.979
including the dining room.

1347
01:05:23.062 --> 01:05:24.729
Thought you might like that.

1348
01:05:26.979 --> 01:05:31.519
Well, let me tell you something,

1349
01:05:31.543 --> 01:05:34.479
Mister Cat
-Cage
-Procurer.

1350
01:05:34.562 --> 01:05:38.060
I will never, ever
allow my precious puss


1351
01:05:38.084 --> 01:05:40.562
to be... [Hades yowls]

1352
01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:44.604
[Hades growls and purrs]

1353
01:05:44.687 --> 01:05:46.060
Well, look at that.

1354
01:05:46.084 --> 01:05:47.479
He likes it in there.

1355
01:05:47.562 --> 01:05:49.562
[grunts quietly]

1356
01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:51.188
Oh, madam, I almost forgot.

1357
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:54.520
Regarding your ladies'
dinner this evening,


1358
01:05:54.604 --> 01:05:57.312
we have neglected
to select a soup.


1359
01:05:57.395 --> 01:05:58.770
Now, there are two choices.

1360
01:05:58.854 --> 01:06:01.353
One is our Cajun
spice crab Creole,


1361
01:06:01.437 --> 01:06:02.956
and the other one is our

1362
01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:04.520
plantation kitchen split pea.

1363
01:06:04.604 --> 01:06:06.769
[inhales sharply]

1364
01:06:06.793 --> 01:06:08.979
Which one is cheaper?

1365
01:06:09.062 --> 01:06:12.021
Well, madam, I'm
sure you will appreciate


1366
01:06:12.104 --> 01:06:14.395
that the crab is
fresh and it is...


1367
01:06:14.479 --> 01:06:15.644
-[shouts] Which one?

1368
01:06:15.668 --> 01:06:16.854
-[groans]

1369
01:06:17.353 --> 01:06:18.645
[sighs]

1370
01:06:18.729 --> 01:06:20.331
Plantation kitchen split pea.

1371
01:06:20.355 --> 01:06:21.979
That's the one.

1372
01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:25.520
Then we will have
the split pea soup.


1373
01:06:25.604 --> 01:06:27.312
Yes, madam.

1374
01:06:27.395 --> 01:06:28.937
[Grand High Witch] And...

1375
01:06:29.021 --> 01:06:32.520
no garlic in the soup.

1376
01:06:34.062 --> 01:06:35.479
No what?

1377
01:06:35.562 --> 01:06:38.188
Garlic.

1378
01:06:40.937 --> 01:06:43.854
No garlic?

1379
01:06:43.937 --> 01:06:45.687
Did I stutter?

1380
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:48.104
No garlic.

1381
01:06:48.188 --> 01:06:52.435
My women, all
suffer from a selective


1382
01:06:52.459 --> 01:06:55.104
food avoidance disorder.

1383
01:06:55.188 --> 01:06:56.562
Picky eaters.

1384
01:06:58.188 --> 01:06:59.498
Yes, madam.

1385
01:06:59.522 --> 01:07:00.854
As you wish.

1386
01:07:00.937 --> 01:07:02.854
I will inform the chef.

1387
01:07:02.937 --> 01:07:05.146
You do that.

1388
01:07:06.645 --> 01:07:08.146
I'll let myself out.

1389
01:07:08.229 --> 01:07:10.312
You do that.

1390
01:07:15.562 --> 01:07:19.288
Well, my precious,
since you enjoy being


1391
01:07:19.312 --> 01:07:24.496
in that cage so much,
-you can stay in it!


1392
01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:26.687
-[snarls]

1393
01:07:26.770 --> 01:07:28.854
Traitor!

1394
01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:35.770
[Grandma] Mouse Maker potion.

1395
01:07:40.562 --> 01:07:42.270
A drop of hyssop...

1396
01:07:43.812 --> 01:07:45.353
[fizzing]

1397
01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:50.353
A smidgen of mugwort...

1398
01:07:53.353 --> 01:07:55.810
And now, a dash
of healing water,


1399
01:07:55.834 --> 01:07:57.021
straight from Lourdes.

1400
01:07:57.104 --> 01:07:58.623
This is the most powerful

1401
01:07:58.647 --> 01:08:00.188
healing water there is.

1402
01:08:04.104 --> 01:08:05.770
Okay.

1403
01:08:05.854 --> 01:08:09.062
Now let's all join hands
and bow our heads.


1404
01:08:20.353 --> 01:08:22.479
[liquid fizzing]

1405
01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.770
Well, I'll be...

1406
01:08:44.021 --> 01:08:47.104
Not much more to
say than that. [sighs]


1407
01:08:47.188 --> 01:08:49.687
We had to try something, kids.

1408
01:08:51.395 --> 01:08:53.872
This witch's
power is far greater


1409
01:08:53.896 --> 01:08:56.896
than my little home remedies.

1410
01:08:56.979 --> 01:08:58.729
Evil power.

1411
01:08:58.812 --> 01:09:01.062
[Grandma] And strong.

1412
01:09:01.146 --> 01:09:03.896
Much stronger than me.

1413
01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:05.979
Please don't cry, Grandma.

1414
01:09:06.062 --> 01:09:07.188
It'll be okay.

1415
01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:09.062
[Grandma] I'm sorry, children.

1416
01:09:09.146 --> 01:09:10.479
It's not your fault, Grandma.

1417
01:09:10.562 --> 01:09:13.812
Sometimes things just happen.

1418
01:09:13.896 --> 01:09:16.021
Yeah, they do.

1419
01:09:18.312 --> 01:09:20.896
I actually don't
mind being a mouse.


1420
01:09:22.395 --> 01:09:24.205
- I get to hang out
- with my new friends all day,


1421
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:25.812
Don't have to go
to school anymore,


1422
01:09:25.896 --> 01:09:27.413
and I don't have to
learn how to drive,


1423
01:09:27.437 --> 01:09:28.581
which means I'll never

1424
01:09:28.605 --> 01:09:29.770
get into an accident.

1425
01:09:29.854 --> 01:09:31.706
Oh, child.

1426
01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:33.604
Come here.

1427
01:09:33.687 --> 01:09:35.770
Grandma, will you
still take care of me?


1428
01:09:35.854 --> 01:09:37.062
Even if I stay a mouse?

1429
01:09:37.146 --> 01:09:39.146
[Grandma] Of
course I will, darling.


1430
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:40.687
Doesn't matter who you are

1431
01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:41.854
or what you look like,

1432
01:09:41.937 --> 01:09:44.021
so long as somebody loves you.

1433
01:09:44.104 --> 01:09:46.229
And I always will.

1434
01:09:50.937 --> 01:09:52.520
What about my friends?

1435
01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:54.854
Can they stay too?

1436
01:09:54.937 --> 01:09:56.729
Well, of course.

1437
01:09:56.812 --> 01:09:58.371
If they want to,
but don't forget,


1438
01:09:58.395 --> 01:10:00.520
they all have loved
ones who miss them.


1439
01:10:00.604 --> 01:10:02.353
I'm not so sure about that.

1440
01:10:02.437 --> 01:10:03.518
Don't be a fool.

1441
01:10:03.542 --> 01:10:04.645
I'm sure they love you.

1442
01:10:04.729 --> 01:10:07.062
My mother thinks I'm clumsy,

1443
01:10:07.146 --> 01:10:08.602
and my father complains

1444
01:10:08.626 --> 01:10:10.104
that I'm always hungry.

1445
01:10:10.188 --> 01:10:11.621
Well, maybe this will
help them love you


1446
01:10:11.645 --> 01:10:13.562
for who you are,
not for who you ain't.


1447
01:10:13.645 --> 01:10:17.645
You're fortunate to
have parents, Bruno.


1448
01:10:17.729 --> 01:10:19.270
Some of us don't.

1449
01:10:19.353 --> 01:10:21.062
But we're gonna be okay.

1450
01:10:21.146 --> 01:10:22.353
We have Grandma.

1451
01:10:22.437 --> 01:10:24.021
And she'll always be our family.

1452
01:10:24.104 --> 01:10:27.562
And for that we
are very blessed.


1453
01:10:27.645 --> 01:10:28.979
But what I wanna know

1454
01:10:29.062 --> 01:10:30.414
is why are we standing

1455
01:10:30.438 --> 01:10:31.812
around here lollygagging?

1456
01:10:31.896 --> 01:10:34.372
How are we gonna stop

1457
01:10:34.396 --> 01:10:34.455
those horrible
witches from turning


1458
01:10:34.479 --> 01:10:37.146
more children into mice?

1459
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:38.937
She's right.

1460
01:10:39.021 --> 01:10:40.854
We got to do something.

1461
01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:42.562
I know what we'll do.

1462
01:10:42.645 --> 01:10:44.227
I sneak into the kitchen with

1463
01:10:44.251 --> 01:10:45.854
the Number 86 Mouse Maker,

1464
01:10:45.937 --> 01:10:48.039
- then I slip the potion
- into the witches' pea soup


1465
01:10:48.146 --> 01:10:49.812
And turn them all into mice.

1466
01:10:49.896 --> 01:10:51.896
Are you sure about
this, little man?


1467
01:10:51.979 --> 01:10:54.330
- This sounds like
- it could be a very dangerous


1468
01:10:54.437 --> 01:10:55.562
And scary mission.

1469
01:10:55.645 --> 01:10:58.812
Trust me, Grandma,
I can handle it.


1470
01:10:58.896 --> 01:11:01.062
[dramatic music playing]

1471
01:11:09.188 --> 01:11:10.437
I'll meet you in the lobby bar.

1472
01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.270
Bruno and Daisy know which vent.

1473
01:11:12.353 --> 01:11:13.729
Be careful, darling.

1474
01:11:13.812 --> 01:11:16.104
I will, Grandma.

1475
01:11:38.437 --> 01:11:40.312
[sous chef] Hurry up there!

1476
01:11:40.395 --> 01:11:42.520
[chef] The pea soup is ready.

1477
01:11:42.604 --> 01:11:43.896
No garlic.

1478
01:11:43.979 --> 01:11:45.247
[sous chef] I got the soup,

1479
01:11:45.271 --> 01:11:47.146
no garlic, Chef,
coming right up.


1480
01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:49.562
[chef] Where are my prawns?

1481
01:11:49.645 --> 01:11:51.520
This is not a prawn,
this is a shrimp.


1482
01:11:51.604 --> 01:11:53.955
- You don't know the difference
- between a shrimp and a prawn?


1483
01:11:53.979 --> 01:11:56.310
Count the pincers.

1484
01:11:56.334 --> 01:11:58.687
Un, deux. One, two.

1485
01:11:58.770 --> 01:12:01.021
Let's start ladling
out that soup.


1486
01:12:01.104 --> 01:12:02.729
Come on, you people.

1487
01:12:02.812 --> 01:12:04.892
- -[chef rushing in French]
- -[sous chef] Yes, Chef.


1488
01:12:06.479 --> 01:12:08.854
[grunting]

1489
01:12:08.937 --> 01:12:10.371
- [chef in English]
- What are you doing, huh?


1490
01:12:10.395 --> 01:12:11.746
[sous chef] I'm getting
the prawns ready.


1491
01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:13.312
[chef] Don't tell
me that's a prawn.


1492
01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.872
- -I'm a crustacean expert.
- -[sous chef] This is a prawn.


1493
01:12:14.896 --> 01:12:16.122
- [chef] I've been
- sauteing prawns for 30 years


1494
01:12:16.146 --> 01:12:17.353
And I only use butter.

1495
01:12:17.437 --> 01:12:19.080
- -[sous chef] Only butter?
- -[chef] Never oil.


1496
01:12:19.104 --> 01:12:21.497
- I don't give a damn
- about what nutritionists say.


1497
01:12:21.604 --> 01:12:23.979
They are the
ruination of cuisine.


1498
01:12:24.062 --> 01:12:27.021
Always butter, butter only.

1499
01:12:27.104 --> 01:12:29.021
[chef speaking French]

1500
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:35.227
[in English]

1501
01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:36.729
Where are my prawns?

1502
01:12:36.812 --> 01:12:38.206
Who do I have to get

1503
01:12:38.230 --> 01:12:39.645
some prawns around here?

1504
01:12:39.729 --> 01:12:42.146
[chef shouts in French]

1505
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:44.229
- [in English] Let's start
- ladling out that soup.


1506
01:12:45.729 --> 01:12:47.353
[sous chef] Yes, Chef.

1507
01:12:47.437 --> 01:12:48.520
[chef] Are you crying?

1508
01:12:48.604 --> 01:12:49.621
There's no crying in my kitchen.

1509
01:12:49.645 --> 01:12:50.812
[gasps]

1510
01:12:52.312 --> 01:12:54.687
Chef, this soup
needs some garlic.


1511
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:56.185
Absolutely no garlic.

1512
01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:57.645
Stringer's orders.

1513
01:12:57.729 --> 01:12:59.188
Grease fire.

1514
01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:01.430
- [sous chef] We got fire
- blankets under those sinks.


1515
01:13:03.437 --> 01:13:05.622
- [chef] Are those my prawns
- that just exploded?


1516
01:13:05.729 --> 01:13:06.812
[grunts]

1517
01:13:08.188 --> 01:13:10.456
- Forget the prawn, just throw
- some shrimp in there.


1518
01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:15.520
- You idiots don't know how...
- [bubbling]


1519
01:13:17.479 --> 01:13:19.021
[chuckles]

1520
01:13:19.104 --> 01:13:20.873
Someone get me a sharp knife

1521
01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:22.687
so that I can kill myself.

1522
01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:24.062
[chef grunts]

1523
01:13:27.687 --> 01:13:29.854
Somebody call an exterminator.

1524
01:13:33.188 --> 01:13:36.562
Look, there's my
mother and father.


1525
01:13:41.146 --> 01:13:42.729
That's your mother and father?

1526
01:13:42.812 --> 01:13:45.770
As I live and breathe.

1527
01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:48.539
- Bruno, I think it's time
- to say hello to your parents.


1528
01:13:48.645 --> 01:13:49.894
Are you mad?

1529
01:13:49.918 --> 01:13:51.188
Right here in the bar?

1530
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:54.104
There's no time
like the present.


1531
01:14:02.062 --> 01:14:03.896
[Grandma clears throat]

1532
01:14:03.979 --> 01:14:07.146
Excuse me, are you
Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins?


1533
01:14:07.812 --> 01:14:09.229
Can we help you?

1534
01:14:09.312 --> 01:14:13.061
I'm afraid I have some,
well, strange news


1535
01:14:13.085 --> 01:14:15.021
about your son, Bruno.

1536
01:14:15.104 --> 01:14:16.498
What about Bruno?

1537
01:14:16.522 --> 01:14:17.937
Where is he?

1538
01:14:18.021 --> 01:14:19.706
Maybe we can go somewhere

1539
01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:21.437
a bit more private.

1540
01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:23.789
- [Mr. Jenkins] Private?
- Why do we have to be private?


1541
01:14:23.896 --> 01:14:25.979
It's not an easy thing
for him to explain.


1542
01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:28.622
- He'd be much more comfortable
- we all went up to your room.


1543
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:30.021
No, no, look here, madam,

1544
01:14:30.104 --> 01:14:32.024
- I'm perfectly comfortable
- exactly where I am.


1545
01:14:32.062 --> 01:14:33.831
So, either you tell me

1546
01:14:33.855 --> 01:14:33.913
where I can find
Bruno or you just


1547
01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:36.437
leave us alone now.

1548
01:14:36.520 --> 01:14:38.229
[Grandma] Well...

1549
01:14:39.562 --> 01:14:41.289
- -got him right here.
- -[shrieks]


1550
01:14:41.395 --> 01:14:43.229
That's a mouse! A mouse!

1551
01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.270
What in God's name
is wrong with you?


1552
01:14:45.353 --> 01:14:47.146
Get that filthy
rodent out of here!


1553
01:14:47.229 --> 01:14:48.687
No, no, no, no. 
This is Bruno.

1554
01:14:48.770 --> 01:14:51.130
- -Bruno, say something to them.
- -[Mrs. Jenkins screaming]


1555
01:14:52.562 --> 01:14:53.623
"Say something"?

1556
01:14:53.647 --> 01:14:54.729
Are you insane?

1557
01:14:54.812 --> 01:14:57.146
Get away from us
before I call the manager.


1558
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:59.309
- Quit all this hollering.
- This is your son, Bruno.


1559
01:14:59.395 --> 01:15:01.479
Manager! Someone
get me the manager.


1560
01:15:01.562 --> 01:15:03.371
- This woman has just scared
- my wife half to death.


1561
01:15:03.395 --> 01:15:04.623
She's walking around

1562
01:15:04.647 --> 01:15:05.896
with rats in her handbag.

1563
01:15:05.979 --> 01:15:07.437
[sighs]

1564
01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.395
Bruno, why didn't
you say something?


1565
01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:13.247
My father hates it when I talk

1566
01:15:13.271 --> 01:15:14.770
with my mouth full.

1567
01:15:14.854 --> 01:15:16.854
[Hero] Psst! Grandma.

1568
01:15:16.937 --> 01:15:18.021
Down here.

1569
01:15:18.104 --> 01:15:19.477
There you are.

1570
01:15:19.501 --> 01:15:20.896
Thank the Lord.

1571
01:15:20.979 --> 01:15:22.146
So, how'd it go?

1572
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:24.812
Soup is on.

1573
01:15:31.812 --> 01:15:35.188
Look! The pea soup.

1574
01:15:36.729 --> 01:15:39.604
[waiter] Here we
are, garlic free.


1575
01:15:42.312 --> 01:15:43.977
Excuse me, madam,

1576
01:15:44.001 --> 01:15:45.687
may I have a word with you?

1577
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:48.021
Please, this way.

1578
01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:51.479
Just over here.

1579
01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:55.665
Um... You wouldn't happen

1580
01:15:55.689 --> 01:15:57.146
to be carrying around a mouse

1581
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:58.979
on your person now, would you?

1582
01:15:59.062 --> 01:16:00.497
- -A mouse?
- -Mmm-hmm.


1583
01:16:00.604 --> 01:16:02.580
- Why on earth would I
- be carrying around a mouse?


1584
01:16:02.604 --> 01:16:04.955
with all the rat
traps being set up


1585
01:16:04.979 --> 01:16:06.229
all over this hotel?

1586
01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:07.604
Rat traps?

1587
01:16:07.687 --> 01:16:09.496
- Is this your pathetic idea
- of a smoke screen?


1588
01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.414
- Accusing your guests
- of carrying around mice


1589
01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.372
- To hide the fact that this
- hotel has a mouse infestation.


1590
01:16:14.479 --> 01:16:15.979
Shh. No... Shh. What?

1591
01:16:16.062 --> 01:16:17.270
I'll tell you this.

1592
01:16:17.353 --> 01:16:18.896
For what this
hotel is costing me,


1593
01:16:18.979 --> 01:16:20.562
I better not see a single mouse.

1594
01:16:20.645 --> 01:16:22.479
Not even a tiny, cute one.

1595
01:16:22.562 --> 01:16:25.104
Yes, madam. I'm so...

1596
01:16:25.188 --> 01:16:26.562
My mistake. I'm sorry.

1597
01:16:26.645 --> 01:16:28.520
Luther.

1598
01:16:28.604 --> 01:16:30.998
- Would you please show
- this lady to our finest table?


1599
01:16:31.104 --> 01:16:32.144
Certainly.

1600
01:16:32.168 --> 01:16:33.229
This way.

1601
01:16:33.979 --> 01:16:36.081
Apologies,
madam, -I, it's just...


1602
01:16:36.105 --> 01:16:37.105
-[Grandma] Mmm.

1603
01:16:40.937 --> 01:16:43.896
Our finest table, madam.

1604
01:16:43.979 --> 01:16:46.372
Oh, uh, thank you, Luther.

1605
01:16:46.396 --> 01:16:46.455
I'm sure your finest table

1606
01:16:46.479 --> 01:16:48.979
in this lovely establishment

1607
01:16:49.062 --> 01:16:51.270
is this one right here
next to the kitchen.


1608
01:16:51.353 --> 01:16:53.270
I always prefer a
table near the exit


1609
01:16:53.353 --> 01:16:55.812
so I can get out fast.

1610
01:16:57.812 --> 01:16:59.581
- -Of course.
- -[Grandma] Mmm.


1611
01:17:10.645 --> 01:17:12.645
[footsteps approaching]

1612
01:17:16.604 --> 01:17:17.770
[Bruno grunts]

1613
01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:30.956
- [Hero whispers]
- Check it out.


1614
01:17:31.062 --> 01:17:32.937
They love the soup.

1615
01:17:33.021 --> 01:17:35.520
[waiter] Have you decided?

1616
01:17:35.604 --> 01:17:37.812
Uh, yes, I think I'll
have the jambalaya.


1617
01:17:37.896 --> 01:17:39.560
Excellent. And would you like

1618
01:17:39.584 --> 01:17:41.270
something to start?

1619
01:17:42.062 --> 01:17:43.229
[Grandma] Mmm...

1620
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:45.479
Well, that pea soup

1621
01:17:45.562 --> 01:17:46.479
those fancy ladies
are eating looks good.


1622
01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:47.645
I'll have that.

1623
01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:49.497
- I'm sorry.
- That soup is reserved


1624
01:17:49.604 --> 01:17:51.227
Strictly for that group

1625
01:17:51.251 --> 01:17:52.896
of lady guests only.

1626
01:17:53.604 --> 01:17:55.080
If I may, that
large party suffers


1627
01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:57.854
from a severe garlic allergy.

1628
01:17:57.937 --> 01:18:00.539
- So, they have requested their
- soup be prepared garlic free.


1629
01:18:00.645 --> 01:18:02.310
It is very bland.

1630
01:18:02.334 --> 01:18:04.021
Practically inedible.

1631
01:18:04.104 --> 01:18:05.562
[witches slurping]

1632
01:18:05.645 --> 01:18:07.104
[Grandma] I see.

1633
01:18:07.188 --> 01:18:10.146
That sounds disgusting.

1634
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:11.602
[waiter] May I suggest

1635
01:18:11.626 --> 01:18:13.021
the Cajun spice crab Creole?

1636
01:18:13.104 --> 01:18:16.062
It's one of our
signature dishes.


1637
01:18:19.937 --> 01:18:23.770
[Grandma] Uh,
sounds... [waiter] Yes?


1638
01:18:23.854 --> 01:18:26.854
Uh, the... The shrimp
Creole will be fine.


1639
01:18:26.937 --> 01:18:28.687
[waiter] You mean
the crab Creole?


1640
01:18:28.770 --> 01:18:30.854
Yes, yes, the crab Creole.

1641
01:18:30.937 --> 01:18:32.395
[waiter] Very good.

1642
01:18:42.312 --> 01:18:44.706
- [quietly] Keep your heads down,
- we got company.


1643
01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:56.229
[whispers] Pigtails.

1644
01:18:56.312 --> 01:18:57.896

to that big trunk.

What's that, Grandma?

1846
01:29:49.395 --> 01:29:51.395
It's a list of names
and addresses

- With that list and that money
- and all this potion,

Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins

weren't really mouse people.

1906
01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:04.353
So, we decided it would be best

1907
01:32:04.437 --> 01:32:06.290
if Bruno came to stay with me,

1908

I sit in the front.


1925
01:33:01.188 --> 01:33:03.854
Grandma, I love being a mouse.

1926
01:33:03.937 --> 01:33:05.729
Oh, I believe you do.

1927
01:33:05.812 --> 01:33:07.172
But you wanna know
something weird?


1928
01:33:07.229 --> 01:33:09.146
I still feel just like a boy.

1929
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:10.645
[Grandma] But you are, darling.

1930
01:33:10.729 --> 01:33:12.479
Life changes all of us.

1931
01:33:12.562 --> 01:33:13.604
I mean, look at me.

1932
01:33:13.687 --> 01:33:15.270
I'm getting on up in the years,

1933
01:33:15.353 --> 01:33:17.770
but I still feel like a girl.

1934
01:33:17.854 --> 01:33:20.062
And I still feel like a boy.

1935
01:33:20.146 --> 01:33:21.770
See?

1936
01:33:21.854 --> 01:33:23.229
You get it.

1937
01:33:23.312 --> 01:33:26.104
Never give up
what you are inside.


1938
01:33:26.188 --> 01:33:28.686
When I look at you, I don't

1939
01:33:28.710 --> 01:33:31.229
see whiskers and a pink nose.

1940
01:33:31.312 --> 01:33:33.437
I just see your eyes.

1941
01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:36.062
Bright and beautiful.

1942
01:33:38.312 --> 01:33:42.812
Grandma, how long
does a mouse live?


1943
01:33:42.896 --> 01:33:44.894
Oh, an ordinary mouse

1944
01:33:44.918 --> 01:33:46.937
only lives about three years,

1945
01:33:47.021 --> 01:33:48.998
but you're no ordinary mouse.

1946
01:33:49.022 --> 01:33:49.080
You're a mouse-person,
and a mouse-person


1947
01:33:49.104 --> 01:33:51.645
will almost certainly live

1948
01:33:51.729 --> 01:33:54.146
three times longer
than an ordinary mouse.


1949
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:55.812
Maybe even longer.

1950
01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:57.312
That's great news.

1951
01:33:57.395 --> 01:33:58.997
I couldn't stand being

1952
01:33:59.021 --> 01:34:00.645
looked after by anybody else.

1953
01:34:00.729 --> 01:34:02.122
I'll be a very old
mouse and you'll be


1954
01:34:02.146 --> 01:34:03.979
a very old grandmother,

1955
01:34:04.062 --> 01:34:06.270
and we'll both die together.

1956
01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:09.479
With a little luck, darling.

1957
01:34:09.562 --> 01:34:11.518
But no one knows how long

1958
01:34:11.542 --> 01:34:13.520
their time is on this earth.

1959
01:34:13.604 --> 01:34:16.062
Only God knows that answer.

1960
01:34:18.896 --> 01:34:23.104
And that is the
natural order of things.
