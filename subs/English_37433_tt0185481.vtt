00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.040
Chichiro...?

2
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.730
Chichiro.... Where are you?

3
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.160
Chichiro... Chichiro...

4
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.010
Is Chichiro a name your father gave him?

5
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.930
Chichirone's the name he gave himself...

6
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.890
I see... What a lovely name.

7
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.240
Aaaaahhh! There you are!

8
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.270
Now it's Sachi's turn...

9
00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.820
Not yet...

10
00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.350
RING... MEOW...

11
00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.300
Not yet...

12
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.080
RING... MEOW... MEOW...

13
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.390
All right...

14
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.190
Come on, Chichirone...

15
00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.430
Come on! Chichirone!

16
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.380
Sachi... Sachi...

17
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.020
All right you two. In you go...

18
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.000
THE RUNNING MAN

19
00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:50.800
THE RUNNING MAN
by Yoshiaki Kawajiri


20
00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.560
Engine output: Check

21
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.350
Oil pressure: Check

22
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.840
Heart rate: Increasing

23
00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.360
Perspiration output: Increasing

24
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.820
Brain-wave patterns: Normal

25
00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:20.910
I'd been sent there by the magazine
to do a story on Zack Hugh...


26
00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:24.820
On him, and the unforgiving race which had
claimed so many mens' lives...


27
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.650
Death Circus.

28
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:32.160
For ten years, one man had reigned
as it's champion... Zack Hugh.


29
00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.230
Many admired him for the control he
had over the machine he drove...


30
00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.400
Total. Absolute. 
Without any fear of death.

31
00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:46.860
Zack the Reaper... The Phoenix...
He'd been given many such names. But...


32
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.230
Ground clearance: Unstable.

33
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.970
Heart rate and perspiration output: Increasing

34
00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:03.210
We're reading a loss in retinal response.

35
00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.030
The races had taken
their toll on the man.

36
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:11.110
The constant stress was too much;
It was destroying him, in both body and mind...


37
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.790
He's past his limit!
That machine's shaking him to pieces!


38
00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.680
It's no good. Pull him out!

39
00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.040
Chief, he isn't slowing down!

40
00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:10.790
What?!

41
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.700
What in God's name...?!

42
00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:06.920
Chief!

43
00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:09.170
Come on!

44
00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:20.370
He crossed the finish line,
and the machine's engines revved up for more.


45
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.110
The race was over,
but the running man was still running...


46
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:57.150
Zack Hugh... A champion among champions.

47
00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:04.150
To this day, his
death remains shrouded in mystery.

48
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:08.240
You're aware of the coup d'etat which occured
five days ago in the Aloana Republic, are you not?


49
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.010
Yes, sir!

50
00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:18.670
You're, of course, also aware of our company's
special project #444 we have under construction
along that country's Piroru River?


51
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.620
Yes, sir!

52
00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:26.090
That project will give our company access to
the Aloana market... and to their resources.


53
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:34.470
However, three days ago, the new government there
unilaterally cancelled our contract.


54
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:36.470
You understand what this means?

55
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:37.660
I see!

56
00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.210
No "I see"!

57
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:44.710
CANCELLED! The project's been cancelled!
They've given us an order to cease construction!


58
00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:51.010
THE ORDER TO CEASE CONSTRUCTION
by Katsuhiro Otomo


59
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.440
Huh?

60
00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.460
Looks like we ran a red light!

61
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:27.180
According to their orders, we must
cease construction of the project immediately.

62
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:32.580
Furthermore, the contract fee
is to be repaid over a period of 20 years.


63
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:33.640
20 years?!

64
00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:38.120
Project 444 was a
difficult operation from the outset.

65
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:42.350
The land they granted to us
was a swamp surrounded by headlands.

66
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:45.860
Come rainy season, the whole
area becomes a virtual river.

67
00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.030
When the waters recede,
the plants grow like monsters.

68
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:56.690
It's an insane, godforsaken place that just
turns back into jungle within half a year.

69
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:58.240
Ah.. ha...

70
00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:03.260
The start-up costs on #444 were enormous.
It still consumes vast amounts of our resources.


71
00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:13.260
We have to shut it down
before we lose any more money!

72
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.220
Why don't you just contact the staff...?

73
00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.960
I already ordered the supervisor
there to shut the project down!

74
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.760
Then why...?

75
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:23.220
The supervisor disappeared without a trace
shortly after I gave the order.


76
00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:24.050
Disappeared?

77
00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:29.330
Due to its location, it was decided that robots
would comprise the main workforce.


78
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:34.130
The only human there is that supervisor.

79
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:35.380
So then...

80
00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:40.310
At this moment, those stupid robots are throwing
valuable resources into the mud!


81
00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:50.380
I'm sending you out there to find that supervisor
and oversee the shut-down of project 444.


82
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.050
I'm COUNTING on you, Sugioka-kun.

83
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.630
Yes, sir!

84
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.790
What the hell...?

85
00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.420
You are the supervisor?

86
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.400
It's worse than he told me...

87
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:39.060
Please give me your
name and employee identification number.

88
00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.760
H
-Hey! What are you doing?!

89
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:47.900
We're outta here! 
Give us a call when you're finished and we'll come back and pick you up!

90
00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.790
You're leaving...? Hey, WAIT!

91
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.560
Take care of yourself!

92
00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.300
Hey! Hold it! Come back here!

93
00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:02.640
What's the big hurry, anyway?

94
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:08.400
Jeez, if they've broken my camera or anything,
it'll be coming out of their paychecks!


95
00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:13.350
For Pete's sake, you
just can't figure these low-lifes.

96
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:22.470
I must have your name and
employee identification number for confirmation. Yes.

97
00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:26.380
Oh, what was his name...? 
That supervisor?

98
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.720
Do you know where he's gone?

99
00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:35.570
Your failure to give me your name and ID number
leads me to conclude that you are not the supervisor.

100
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:45.810
If you are not the supervisor, then you
are unauthorized personnel and have no business being here...

101
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:49.200
Anyway, just take me to my quarters and
you can tell me what you know in detail.

102
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:56.090
Any person who is classified as a threat to
construction will be removed so that construction may continue. Yes.

103
00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:02.920
Sugioka Tsutomu. 
ID number CX-88.

104
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:06.520
Check completed, yes!

105
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.300
Hmpf!

106
00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:14.730
Welcome, Supervisor, from the distant land.

107
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:16.500
Yeah, yeah. Glad to meet you.

108
00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:23.340
I am number one here at Project 444...

109
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:33.340
...and all orders relating to construction here at
Project 444 are transmitted through me, via radio.

110
00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:38.170
Cripes, they're really buzzing away down there.

111
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:48.170
This procedure is very important, Supervisor.
Failure to follow this system may result in mix-ups. Yes.


112
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:58.030
Fine, we'll use the system to give everyone here the new orders.
The first one I want you to transmit will be the order to cease construct...


113
00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:59.140
Hey! Hold it!

114
00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.520
I haven't finished giving you my orders yet.

115
00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.790
Hey! HEY!

116
00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.480
What's the meaning of this?! Hey!

117
00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:16.450
Supervisor must be tired after his long journey. Yes.
I will now return to my duties.


118
00:33:16.450 --> 00:33:18.900
So why am I locked in? HEY!

119
00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:22.700
There are dangerous insects in the area.
It is for your safety that...


120
00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:25.930
God dammit, open this door! Hey!

121
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:35.550
Don't you understand?!
Open up! Come on!


122
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.700
Supervisor's schedule for tomorrow
is posted on the bulletin board.
It is to be followed precisely.


123
00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:36.710
Come back here! Don't you hear me?
I'm telling you to come back and open this door!


124
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:39.450
Open it. God damn it...

125
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:44.450
Help! This crazy robot's trying to kill me!
To my wife, Sachiko: I'm done for, but you must know...


126
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:49.450
that I love you. It's strange, but all I can
think about now is what my mother used to say to me


127
00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:54.450
when I was young: "Study hard!" She'd say.
"Study hard, and you'll grow
up to be a fine man...."


128
00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:13.580
From a quarter of until 10:25 will be the first on-site inspection.
At 10:30, in the resource room, we will...


129
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:17.870
There, Supervisor. Section eight.
This section is furthest behind in construction.


130
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.750
Hey! What's with that robot over there?

131
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:47.140
Overheat. Due to the intense pace of construction here,
it's circuits are malfunctioning.


132
00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:55.450
WHAT?! Do you know how much that thing costs?
Airplanes are less expensive than those things!


133
00:35:55.450 --> 00:36:05.300
Due to this section's being so far behind schedule,
I have ordered all units here to work at peak capacity. Yes.


134
00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:09.710
My orders are to have Project 444 ready by the due date.
Some losses are to be expected. Yes.


135
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:15.620
Listen to me! There IS NO DUE DATE anymore!
And you're supposed to be conserving our resources, not...


136
00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.610
Due date is only one month away. Yes.

137
00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:23.560
To make the due date, the
robots must work at peak capacity. YES.

138
00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.720
H-Hey, what gives?
Don't get sore at me...


139
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:40.220
We will now inspect section ten.
Follow me, Supervisor...


140
00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:46.050
W
-Wait for me!

141
00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:56.370
Breakfast will last until
half past the hour. Yes.

142
00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:03.050
From a quarter of until 10:25
will be the first on-site inspection.

143
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:07.830
At 10:30, in the the resource room, will be a report on
last month's work, which you and I will...


144
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.010
What the hell...

145
00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:04.950
We should be leaving soon, Supervisor...

146
00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.940
Hold it! Hold it!

147
00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:25.260
I've had enough of you making a fool of me!
How much of this crap do think I'm going to take?!


148
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:34.970
Because the rainy season will soon be here,
I have ordered all robots to work at maximum output.


149
00:38:34.970 --> 00:38:38.600
Wha... Who ordered you to do that?!

150
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:45.200
Losses have increased slightly,
but construction has been greatly speeded up.


151
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.490
Please be happy, Supervisor.

152
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:51.620
Increased slightly... 
How much is "slightly"?!

153
00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.760
Today's losses: 20. Yes.

154
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.550
Tomorrow's expected losses: 24. Yes.

155
00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:02.010
There's no way I'm just going to stand here and
let you keep shredding our robots!


156
00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:06.840
Now listen to me and listen good, you dumb sonofabitch robot!
You are ordered to cease construction.


157
00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.270
You're to stop immediately. 
You got that?!

158
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:16.360
The order you have just given is classified as
an obstacle to construction.


159
00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:22.860
Your clearance to command me is now void.

160
00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.700
Shut up!! I'm telling you
to stop, you stupid robot!

161
00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:32.710
All obstacles to construction must be removed. Yes.

162
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:35.180
Removed...?

163
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:57.670
From this day forward, your on-site inspections are
cancelled permanently. Yes.


164
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.640
Madness...

165
00:41:55.500 --> 00:42:00.220
Good morning, Supervisor.
I have brought you your breakfast.


166
00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.860
It worked!

167
00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:24.500
Even if I am destroyed,
construction will never cease. Yes.

168
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:24.580
There will be no changes.

169
00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:34.000
We must complete by... due-date... Yes..Yes...

170
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.500
God damn you! You bastard!!!

171
00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:57.640
It's no use. Those
stupid things are still working...

172
00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:06.180
Yeah, of course. He was just a terminal, after all.
They won't stop unless I shut down the main core completely!


173
00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:13.030
This cable should lead me there...

174
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.890
Emergency! Priority one message from headquarters!

175
00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:27.580
Sometime earlier today, another coup d'etat occured
in the new Aloana Republic.


176
00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:36.620
The new government has been restored,
and Project 444 has been reinstated!


177
00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.790
Repeat, Project 444 has been reinstated!

178
00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:46.100
Tsutomu Sugioka. It's me, Maruyama.

179
00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:51.530
Sugioka! It's me! 
Do you read me?

180
00:43:51.530 --> 00:43:54.180
Come in! Sugioka...!
