00:05:57.041 --> 00:05:59.662
지금쯤이면 똘똘이가 딱딱해서
 유리를 자를 정도일텐데


158
00:05:59.752 --> 00:06:02.124
Nathan loves me, and Nathan respects me.

159
00:06:02.212 --> 00:06:02.213
그래
 A. 여자를 존중한다고 해서 남자는
 섹스를 포기하지는 않아


160
00:06:02.213 --> 00:06:06.459
Okay. A, a guy never respects a girl
 enough to give up sex.


161
00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:06.761
그리고 B
 넌 어때?


162
00:06:06.761 --> 00:06:08.835
And, B, well, what about you?

163
00:06:09.136 --> 00:06:09.139
다나 너 지금쯤이면
 매우 달아 올랐을텐데


164
00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.923
You must be feeling
 pretty randy by now, Dana.


165
00:06:12.723 --> 00:06:12.727
맞아, 사실 조금

166
00:06:12.727 --> 00:06:15.296
Okay, well, yeah, maybe, like,
 the tiniest bit,


167
00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:15.397
하지만 난 정말 뭔가 더 높은
 힘으로 연결된 거 같은 느낌이 들어


168
00:06:15.397 --> 00:06:17.848
but I really feel like I'm connecting
 with the higher power here.


169
00:06:17.936 --> 00:06:17.943
그래, 그게 매우 멋진 건 알지만

170
00:06:17.943 --> 00:06:20.511
Yes, I know, and that is totally fab,

171
00:06:20.607 --> 00:06:20.614
난 못 하겠어
 내가 너무 입으로 하는 걸
 좋아해서 말야


172
00:06:20.614 --> 00:06:23.976
but I know I couldn't do it.
 I'm way too into giving blow jobs.


173
00:06:24.527 --> 00:06:24.536

Hey, don't listen to lmogen, okay?

177
00:06:29.032 --> 00:06:29.042
섹스는 정말 중요해
 그리고 네가 준비가 안 된 거 같으면


178
00:06:29.042 --> 00:06:32.033
Sex is a really big deal,
 and if you feel like you're not ready,


179
00:06:32.118 --> 00:06:32.129
기다리는 게 좋을 거야

180
00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:34.277

DANA: But...

183
00:06:37.123 --> 00:06:37.136
미안하지만 하이디
 넌 도대체 네가 무슨 말
 하는지 알기나 하니?


184
00:06:37.136 --> 00:06:40.492
No offence, Heidi, but you have no idea
 what you're talking about.

 응?


188
00:06:52.574 --> 00:06:54.466
- Hey, Rob.
 - ROB: Yeah?


189
00:06:54.975 --> 00:06:54.994
뭐 좀 물어봐도 돼?
 물론, 뭔데?


190
00:06:54.994 --> 00:06:57.182
- Can I ask you something?
 - Sure. What's up?


191
00:06:57.269 --> 00:06:57.288
이거 좀 사적인데

192
00:06:57.288 --> 00:06:59.262
Well, it's kind of personal.

193
00:07:01.232 --> 00:07:01.252
응

194
00:07:01.252 --> 00:07:02.477
Okay.

195
00:07:03.401 --> 00:07:03.422
내가 생각해 본 건데
 너 내가 처녀인 거 알지?


196
00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:07.149
I've been thinking.
 You know I'm a virgin, right?


197
00:07:08.197 --> 00:07:08.220
그냥... 나도 모르겠어

198
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.525
It's just...I don't know.

199
00:07:09.615 --> 00:07:09.638
모두 다 옛날 옛 적에
 다 해버린 거 같아


200
00:07:09.638 --> 00:07:11.940
Everyone's already done it
 like a million times already,


201
00:07:12.076 --> 00:07:12.100
그리고 난 남친 비슷한 거도 없고

202
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.493
and I know I don't have a boyfriend
 or whatever, but...


203
00:07:16.373 --> 00:07:16.398
하지만 가끔 난 그냥
잊어 버려야 할 거 같아

204
00:07:16.398 --> 00:07:18.579
But sometimes I feel like I should just
 get it over with.


205
00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:18.693
그러니까 내 말은 이 것도
 지날갈 일이잖아
 처녀라는 거


206
00:07:18.693 --> 00:07:22.878
You know? I mean,
 just get past this whole thing, this virgin.


207
00:07:23.463 --> 00:07:23.491
이게 도대체 무슨 의미가 있겠어?

208
00:07:23.491 --> 00:07:25.539
What does that even mean, anyway?

209
00:07:25.924 --> 00:07:25.926
내가 한 번도 해본 적이 없는데
 그래서 그게 뭐?


210
00:07:25.926 --> 00:07:29.210
So I've never had a penis in my vagina,
 but so what?


211
00:07:29.553 --> 00:07:32.922
<i>Why do I have to label everything?
 Like, "She's too innocent.</i>


212
00:07:33.014 --> 00:07:33.015
<i>"She can't handle it:"
 I'm not that innocent.</i>


213
00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:36.015
"쟤는 못 할 거야"
 난 그렇게 순진하지 않아


214
00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:36.101
<i>I've seen Showgirls and Blue Lagoon.</i>

215
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:38.386
나도 쇼걸이랑 블루 라군 봤다고
 (둘 다 야한 영화 제목)


216
00:07:40.936 --> 00:07:40.940
Anyways, I think I've decided to just do it.
 But what do you think?


217
00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.430
어쨌든, 나 그냥 하기로 했어
 어떻게 생각해?


218
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:45.945
Yeah. I think you should definitely
 go ahead and get it over with.


219
00:07:45.945 --> 00:07:51.319
그래 그러는 게 좋을 거 같아

220

하이디를 찾으러 다녔거든요
 나는 누굴 입으로 해 주고
 있었다고 들었는데


462
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.039
Cody! Well, I don't know
 how you're gonna go on the school ski trip


463
00:16:40.039 --> 00:16:44.038
코디!
 네가 계속 벌 받는 중이면


464
00:16:44.118 --> 00:16:44.127
if you're still on detention.

465
00:16:44.127 --> 00:16:45.538
학교 스키 캠프에 갈 수
 있을지 모르겠구나


466
00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:45.629
Mom, I don't see what that has to do with it.
 I didn't do anything.


467
00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:48.416
엄마 전 진짜
 아무 짓도 안 했어요


468
00:16:48.499 --> 00:16:48.507
I heard you were the fluffer.

469
00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.040
형이 '플러퍼' 였다며
 (fluffer란 포르노에서 남자 배우의 성기가
 발기된 상태로 유지되도록 하는 여자)


470
00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:50.884
- Cody.
 - Look. His lips are chapped.


471
00:16:50.884 --> 00:16:52.793
코디
 보세요 형 입술이 텄잖아요


472
00:16:52.921 --> 00:16:54.047
(EXCLAIMS)

473
00:16:54.047 --> 00:16:54.054
Well, we'll see.

474
00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:55.375
생각 해 볼 게

475
00:16:56.384 --> 00:16:56.390
All right. I have to go get ready.

476
00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.875
알았어요
 저 나갈 준비 할 게요


477
00:17:01.557 --> 00:17:01.561
Maybe it's in the garage.

478
00:17:01.561 --> 00:17:03.465
창고에 있는 거 같구나

479
00:17:07.021 --> 00:17:07.025
Rob? I wanna have
a little chat with you.

480
00:17:07.025 --> 00:17:10.063
롭?
 너랑 얘기 좀 했으면 하는데


481
00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:10.363
Do we have to?

482
00:17:10.363 --> 00:17:11.442
꼭이요?

483
00:17:11.528 --> 00:17:11.531
Honey, I know that you're growing older,

484
00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:14.982
아가야 나도 네가
 나이든 걸 알지만


485
00:17:15.074 --> 00:17:15.076
and I don't know what your father
 has told you about things,


486
00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:18.741
너희 아버지가 말해 줬는지
 모르겠구나


487
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.830
but I think it's important to discuss
 everything, you know?


488
00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.866
내 생각엔 모든 걸 얘기하는 게
 좋은 거 같구나


489
00:17:21.957 --> 00:17:21.958
Like about sex.

490
00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:23.748
섹스 말이다

491
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.243
- Are you having sex?
 - Mom, I don't wanna talk about this.


492
00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:28.340
내가 세탁소에서
 양말을 찾아 왔는데


493
00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:33.048
No, well, it's just that I found
 this sock in the laundry, and, well...


494
00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:33.513
오 세상에
 엄마 저리 치워요


495
00:17:33.513 --> 00:17:35.920
Oh, God, Mom. Put that away.

496
00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:38.479
그리고 누가 나한테
 비디오를 보냈더구나


497
00:17:38.479 --> 00:17:43.636
And, also,
 somebody sent me a link to this video.


498
00:17:44.148 --> 00:17:44.152
하지마, 안돼 프리지! 안돼~

499
00:17:44.152 --> 00:17:46.105
<i>ROB: No, no, no, Frizzy! No.</i>

500
00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:46.197
-엄마 꺼요!
 -어떻게 하는지 몰라!


501
00:17:46.197 --> 00:17:47.851
- Mom, just turn it off!
 - I don't know how!


502
00:17:47.943 --> 00:17:47.948
네 동생이 배경 화면으로
 해 놨단 말야


503
00:17:47.948 --> 00:17:49.568
Your brother made it my start-up screen.

504
00:17:49.653 --> 00:17:49.658
-제가 바꿀 게요
 -정말?


505
00:17:49.658 --> 00:17:51.646
- Okay, I can...I can fix that.
 - You can? Great.


506
00:17:51.739 --> 00:17:51.745
네

507
00:17:51.745 --> 00:17:52.770
- Yeah.
 - Thanks.


508
00:17:52.865 --> 00:17:52.870
하지마, 안돼 프리지! 안돼~
 얘기 나눠서 좋았구요


509
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.656
<i>- No, no, no, Frizzy! No!
 - Thank you for that.</i>


510
00:17:54.742 --> 00:17:54.748
자 이제 됐죠?
 그쵸?


511
00:17:54.748 --> 00:17:56.366
- Okay.
 - And we're done. Right? Yeah.


512
00:17:56.452 --> 00:17:56.458
아가야
 부끄러울 필요 없단다


513
00:17:56.458 --> 00:17:58.777
Well, honey, please.
 There's no reason to be ashamed.


514
00:17:58.871 --> 00:17:58.878
자위는 자연스러운 거야

515
00:17:58.878 --> 00:18:00.531
Masturbation is perfectly natural.

516
00:18:00.623 --> 00:18:00.631
내 말은 네 나이 또래 애들 중에는
 이미 해 본 애들도 있겠지만


517
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:04.573
I mean, boys your age
 are maybe into experimentation


518
00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:04.678
동물이랑 하는 것도 말이다

519
00:18:04.678 --> 00:18:07.919
and trying new things with animals.

520
00:18:08.465 --> 00:18:08.475
프리지는 아기 강아지 때 부터
 우리랑 함께 지냈잖니


521
00:18:08.475 --> 00:18:12.083
I mean, Frizzy, she's been in our family for...
 Since she was a puppy...


522
00:18:12.218 --> 00:18:12.229
저 늦었어요

523
00:18:12.229 --> 00:18:14.211
(STAMMERS) Hey, I'm late.

524
00:18:24.981 --> 00:18:24.994
-늦었구나
 -죄송해요


525
00:18:24.994 --> 00:18:27.472
- You're tardy.
 - Sorry.


526
00:18:28.568 --> 00:18:28.582
손상된 책들
 치우는 것 부터 해라


527
00:18:28.582 --> 00:18:30.811
You can start by cleaning off
 all the damaged books


528
00:18:30.905 --> 00:18:30.919
그리고 망가진 거 분류하고
 내가 지켜보마


529
00:18:30.919 --> 00:18:34.440
and separating the ruined ones.
 I'll be checking on you.


530
00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:37.218
하이디, 어제 말야

531
00:18:37.218 --> 00:18:39.955
Heidi. Look, about last night...

532
00:18:40.623 --> 00:18:40.639
별로 얘기하고 싶지 않아

533
00:18:40.639 --> 00:18:41.998
I don't wanna talk about it.

534
00:18:43.251 --> 00:18:43.267
-난 그냥
 -롭


535
00:18:43.267 --> 00:18:45.742
- Well, I just wanted to tell you...
 - Rob.


536
00:18:48.005 --> 00:18:48.023
이 것 좀 비우고 올게

537
00:18:48.023 --> 00:18:49.879
I'm gonna go empty this bucket.

538
00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:40.422
내가 뭘 찾았는지 알아?

539
00:19:40.422 --> 00:19:42.599
Do you have any
idea what I found here?

540
00:19:42.687 --> 00:19:42.717
이 건 성경이야!
 난 이게 전설인 줄만 알았는데


541
00:19:42.717 --> 00:19:45.178
- This is the bible.
 - I thought that was an urban legend.


542
00:19:45.273 --> 00:19:45.303
아냐 이건 진짜야
 거의 몇 십년이나 된 거라고


543
00:19:45.303 --> 00:19:47.645
No. This is real. 
This goes back decades.

544
00:19:47.734 --> 00:19:47.764
그래, 그래서?

545
00:19:47.764 --> 00:19:49.643
Okay. So what?

546
00:19:49.736 --> 00:19:49.766
이게 바로 우리에게
 필요한 거야


547
00:19:49.766 --> 00:19:52.310
This is exactly what we need
 to finally get laid.


548
00:19:53.073 --> 00:19:53.105
이 게 뭘 도와준다는 건데?
 다 탔구만


549
00:19:53.105 --> 00:19:55.564
How is this thing gonna help us get laid?
 It's ruined.


550
00:19:55.743 --> 00:19:55.775
거의 읽지도
 못 하겠다


551
00:19:55.775 --> 00:19:57.901
You can't even read most of it.

552
00:19:57.995 --> 00:19:58.028
이 책은 학교에서 매년 행운의
 사나이 한 명을 도와줬었어


553
00:19:58.028 --> 00:20:00.912
This book has helped one lucky guy
 each year at Great Falls.


554
00:20:01.123 --> 00:20:01.157
그리고 올해는
 그 사나이가 바로 나야


555
00:20:01.157 --> 00:20:04.243
And this year, that lucky guy is us.

556
00:20:04.835 --> 00:20:04.870
좀 탔지만 그래도 여전히 좋은
 정보가 있어 이 것 봐봐


557
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:08.418
Even with the damage, it still has
 a ton of useful stuff. Check this out.


558
00:20:09.465 --> 00:20:09.500
1977년 2월 1일

<i>"February 1st, 1977. 
The G-spot:"</i>

560
00:20:15.512 --> 00:20:15.549
그 정돈 아는데
 또 뭐 있어?


561
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:18.218
- I can dig it.
 - LUBE: What else you got?


562
00:20:18.642 --> 00:20:18.679
1991년
 어떻게 털을 깎아야
 똘똘이가 더 커보이는가

<i>"1991 . How to shave your pubes
 to make your dick look bigger:"</i>


564
00:20:22.771 --> 00:20:22.809
아빠가 보여준 적 있어

565
00:20:22.809 --> 00:20:24.348
Dad showed me that one.

566
00:20:24.439 --> 00:20:24.477
2003년 방금 경험한
 놀라운 성경험

<i>"2003. I just had

여기 잘 안 보이는 게 있는데
 "그녀는 박하사탕을 사용했다"


569
00:20:28.858 --> 00:20:32.733
<i>Something I can't read.
 "She used a breath mint:"</i>


570
00:20:33.281 --> 00:20:33.322
박하 사탕?
 뭐하러?


571
00:20:33.322 --> 00:20:35.819
A breath mint? For what?

572
00:20:36.284 --> 00:20:36.325
야 이 멍청아
 박하 사탕을 똥꼬에 넣으면 사탕 때문에
 똥꼬가 꽉 쪼여질 거 아냐


573
00:20:36.325 --> 00:20:40.780
You moron. You stick it up your tailpipe and
 the minty-ness makes your asshole twitch.


574
00:20:41.696 --> 00:20:41.873
Everyone knows that.

575
00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:43.273
모두 다 알던데

576
00:20:44.199 --> 00:20:44.376
Dude, I don't know. 
This sounds pretty weak.

577
00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:46.495
야, 난 모르겠다
 이 거 좀 이상해


578
00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:46.583
Plus, I mean, we can find most of this stuff
 on the internet anyway.


579
00:20:46.671 --> 00:20:49.165
게다가 이런 거
 인터넷에 널렸잖아


580
00:20:49.165 --> 00:20:49.244
No, this is different.
 This has personal experiences.


581
00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.044
이 건 달라
 개인적인 경험들이잖아


582
00:20:52.044 --> 00:20:52.127
Plus, it's custom-tailored to
 Great Falls girls.


583
00:20:52.218 --> 00:20:54.547
게다가 우리 학교 여자애들의
 취향에 따라 수정되기도 한 거고


584
00:20:54.547 --> 00:20:54.625
Since when does punani have a zip code?

585
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.425
언제부터 여자의 거기마다
 서로 다른 취향이 있었다고


586
00:20:56.425 --> 00:20:56.512
What have we got to lose? Nathan,
 you've been working on Dana for, what?


587
00:20:56.597 --> 00:20:59.596
우리가 잃을 게 뭐 있어?
 다나한테 네가 왜 작업한건데?


588
00:20:59.596 --> 00:20:59.682
Like six months? Only to find out that
 she loves the Lord more than sex?


589
00:20:59.767 --> 00:21:03.464
6달 동안이나 다나가 섹스보다 신을
 더 좋아한다는 걸 알려고?


590
00:21:05.354 --> 00:21:05.523
And, Lube, how have all your schemes
 to get laid been working out so far?


591
00:21:05.523 --> 00:21:08.691
루브 넌 네 계획마다
 제대로 되는 게 없잖아

100달러 잃었지

594
00:21:09.901 --> 00:21:09.974
Exactly, and me, well, I've been wasting
 all my time on some fantasy that someday


595
00:21:10.069 --> 00:21:14.700
그래 그러니까!
 난 내 삶을 언젠가는
 하이디가 날 사랑할거라는


596
00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:14.779
Heidi's gonna fall madly in love with me.
 Face it, guys, we need help.


597
00:21:14.866 --> 00:21:17.996
환상으로 낭비하고 있었어

598
00:21:17.996 --> 00:21:18.033
And this is it, staring
us right in the face.

599
00:21:18.161 --> 00:21:20.487
그리고 이 게 바로 우릴
 바른 길로 인도해 줄거야


600
00:21:22.127 --> 00:21:22.291
- I'm in.
 - All right.


601
00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:23.371
나 낄래
 좋아


602
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:24.293
I'm in.

603
00:21:24.293 --> 00:21:25.491

1503
00:53:36.599 --> 00:53:39.287
- I can't find Heidi anywhere.
 - Maybe she didn't come.

00:53:39.378 --> 00:53:39.449
아냐 밖에
 차가 있단 말야

No, no. Her car is outside.

1506
00:53:42.591 --> 00:53:42.710
넌 어떻게 돼 가?

1507
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:43.366
How you making out?

1508
00:53:43.842 --> 00:53:43.930
저기 봐

 just a little bit out of your league?

 you've been at it for years.

 아닌 거 같아

in the cards for you.

 왜 6점짜리를 갖겠어?


1519
00:53:59.085 --> 00:54:01.816
Why settle for a six
 when you can get a perfect 10?


1520
00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:05.511
네가 좋다면야
 잘 해 봐

너도 내가 너 좋아하는 거
 알지?


1537
00:54:26.355 --> 00:54:29.836
You obviously know that I'm,
 like, totally into you. Right?


1538
00:54:30.097 --> 00:54:30.319
그럼
 네가 날 숭배하는 걸 알지


1539

Okay, so I'm just gonna be honest with you.
 I'm just gonna lay it out on the line.

01:03:39.973 --> 01:03:40.154
우리가 성경을
 복원하는 거야


1811
01:03:40.154 --> 01:03:42.096
We need to reconstruct the bible.

1812
01:03:42.184 --> 01:03:42.364
왜?

1813
01:03:42.364 --> 01:03:43.263
Why?

1814
01:03:43.351 --> 01:03:43.532
비밀이 이 안에 있어

1815
01:03:43.532 --> 01:03:44.762
The secrets are in there.

1816
01:03:44.853 --> 01:03:45.034
그러니까 여자와 자기 위한
 비법이 어딘 가에 있을 거야


1817
01:03:45.034 --> 01:03:47.770
I mean, there's no one single answer
 to getting laid.


1818
01:03:47.856 --> 01:03:48.037
우린 책의 일부가 아닌
 전체가 필요한 거였어


1819
01:03:48.037 --> 01:03:49.813
Right? We need the whole book
 to understand.


1820
01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:50.080
분명히 우리가 꼭 알아야
 할 여러 비법이 있을 거야


1821
01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:51.976
Probably has a lot of crap in there
 that we need to know, too,


1822
01:03:52.068 --> 01:03:52.249
자세, 기술, 삽입의 각도
 같은 것들 말야


1823
01:03:52.249 --> 01:03:55.069
like positions, techniques,
 angle of insertion.


1824
01:03:55.155 --> 01:03:55.336
이 책은 바로 우리 같은
 초보를 위해 만들어진 거니까


1825
01:03:55.336 --> 01:03:59.366
Exactly. That's what the bible was
 created for, to help guys like us.


1826
01:03:59.534 --> 01:03:59.715
내가 성경을 망쳤으니
 지식을 이어 받을 후배들에게


1827
01:03:59.715 --> 01:04:02.655
And we owe it to the others.
 I ruined the bible.


1828
01:04:02.997 --> 01:04:03.178
빚을 지고 있는 셈이지

1829
01:04:03.178 --> 01:04:05.535
I owe it to future generations
 to restore its wisdom.


1830
01:04:05.625 --> 01:04:05.805
나도 복원하고 싶어
 근데 어떻게 하게?


1831
01:04:05.805 --> 01:04:08.376
Dude, I'm all for it, but how?

1832
01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:14.564
어디 부터
 시작하지?


1833
01:04:14.564 --> 01:04:16.043
Where do we start?

1834
01:04:18.095 --> 01:04:18.276
창조자를 찾아야지

1835
01:04:18.276 --> 01:04:19.803
From the beginning.

1836
01:04:20.264 --> 01:04:20.445
이 사람이 성경을
 만든 게 분명해


1837
01:04:20.445 --> 01:04:22.056
LUBE: This must be the guy
 who created the bible.


1838
01:04:24.032 --> 01:04:25.609
(RINGING)

1839
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.410
여보세요?

1840
01:04:27.410 --> 01:04:28.428
Hello?

1841
01:04:28.523 --> 01:04:28.703
안녕하세요
 노아 레빈스틴씨 계신 가요?


1842
01:04:28.703 --> 01:04:31.311
<i>ROB: Hi: May I speak
 to Noah Levenstein, please?</i>


1843
01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:31.582
접니다

1844
01:04:31.582 --> 01:04:32.433
Speaking.

1845
01:04:32.528 --> 01:04:32.708
혹시 성경
 창조자이신가요?


1846
01:04:32.708 --> 01:04:34.853
Are you the one who created the bible?

1847
01:04:36.198 --> 01:04:36.379
아뇨
 아마 신이 창조했을 겁니다


1848
01:04:36.379 --> 01:04:38.605
No, that would be God.

1849
01:04:38.784 --> 01:04:38.965
저기요
 잠깐만요


1850
01:04:38.965 --> 01:04:40.611
<i>No, no, no: Hold on.</i>

1851
01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:41.092
특별한 성경 말이에요

1852
01:04:41.092 --> 01:04:44.244
I'm referring to the bible.

1853
01:04:45.165 --> 01:04:45.346
전 이스트 그레이트 폴스
 고등학교 학생이에요


1854
01:04:45.346 --> 01:04:46.909
<i>I'm calling from
 East Great Falls High School.</i>


1855
01:04:50.128 --> 01:04:50.309
내가 3학년이던
 1969년 여름이었어


1856
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:54.173
NOAH: It was the summer
 of my junior year, 1969,


1857
01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:54.438
친구들과 난 암스테르담으로
 여행을 떠났는데


1858
01:04:54.438 --> 01:04:57.010
and my buddies and I,
 we take this trip to Amsterdam,


1859
01:04:57.095 --> 01:04:57.275
지미 핸드릭스 LP판과
 자신들을 교환하려는


1860
01:04:57.275 --> 01:05:01.009
where we run into a group
 of semi-attractive Dutch nymphos


1861
01:05:01.099 --> 01:05:01.279
독일 음란녀들을 만났어

1862
01:05:01.279 --> 01:05:05.310
who were willing to trade their bodies
 for a handful of Jimi Hendrix LPs.


1863
01:05:05.395 --> 01:05:05.575
말할 필요도 없이
 우리는 독일녀들과


1864
01:05:05.575 --> 01:05:09.891
Well, needless to say, we had ourselves
 one super weekend with those gals,


1865
01:05:10.108 --> 01:05:10.288
정말 끝내주는
 한 주를 보냈지


1866
01:05:10.288 --> 01:05:12.813
sexually speaking, if you get my drift.

1867
01:05:13.611 --> 01:05:13.792
하지만 슬프게도 우리는
 우리가 뭘 하는지도 몰랐어


1868
01:05:13.792 --> 01:05:16.482
But the sad news was,
 we had no idea what we were doing.


1869
01:05:16.573 --> 01:05:16.753
우린 기술이 없었거든

1870
01:05:16.753 --> 01:05:18.316
We had no technique.

1871
01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:18.880
그런데 어느 날
 경치를 보러 나갔는데


1872
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.451
And then one day, we were out sight-seeing,

1873
01:05:21.536 --> 01:05:21.716
홍등가에서
 독일 창녀들을 만났어


1874
01:05:21.716 --> 01:05:24.491
and we run into this Dutch hooker
 in the red-light district,


1875
01:05:24.582 --> 01:05:24.762
그녀가 우리에게
 성경에 대해 알려주더군


1876
01:05:24.762 --> 01:05:26.989
and she tells us about this book.

1877
01:05:28.168 --> 01:05:28.349
성경은 바로 19세기
 성직자가 쓴 섹스 설명서였어


1878
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:33.210
It was a sex manual, evidently written
 in the 19th century by some priest.


1879
01:05:33.299 --> 01:05:33.479
우린 그 책을
 샅샅이 읽고


1880
01:05:33.479 --> 01:05:35.671
Well, we read that thing cover to cover,

1881
01:05:35.759 --> 01:05:35.940
학교로 돌아왔지

1882
01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:38.215
and then when we got back
 to East Great Falls,


1883
01:05:38.304 --> 01:05:38.484
근데 내가 경험을 담은
 나만의 책을 만들어서


1884
01:05:38.484 --> 01:05:41.055
I had the bright idea
to write my own book

1885
01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:41.320
조언도 함께 적어놓고

1886
01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:45.184
and add my own observations
 and experiences and advice


1887
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.449
우리와 같은 총각이 보도록
 도서관에 놔두면 어떨까 생각했지


1888
01:05:45.449 --> 01:05:49.183
and leave it in the library for some
 other hapless virgin in the class below us.


1889
01:05:49.273 --> 01:05:49.453
난 그 게 40년 동안
 계속 이어질 줄은 몰랐지


1890
01:05:49.453 --> 01:05:53.354
But I had no idea it had been
 passed down for 40 years.


1891
01:05:53.570 --> 01:05:53.750
선배님의 성경은
 정말 전설이에요


1892
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:56.191
Your book is a legend, 
Mr Levenstein.

1893
01:05:58.700 --> 01:05:58.880
혹시 가져왔니?

1894
01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.194
Do you have it here?

1895
01:06:00.285 --> 01:06:00.465
네

1896
01:06:00.465 --> 01:06:01.364
Yeah.

1897
01:06:01.453 --> 01:06:01.633
내가 봐도 될 까?

1898
01:06:01.633 --> 01:06:03.113
May I see it?

1899
01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:07.139
오

1900
01:06:07.139 --> 01:06:08.121
Oh.

1901
01:06:08.501 --> 01:06:08.682
오 세상에

1902
01:06:08.682 --> 01:06:09.700
Oh, my.

1903
01:06:11.254 --> 01:06:11.435
얘들아

1904
01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:12.333
Boys.

1905
01:06:14.007 --> 01:06:14.187
이 건 정말 살아있는
 역사구나


1906
01:06:14.187 --> 01:06:16.794
This is a real piece of history here.

1907
01:06:17.512 --> 01:06:17.692
도대체 무슨 일이
 일어난 거니?


1908
01:06:17.692 --> 01:06:19.303
What happened to it?

1909
01:06:19.472 --> 01:06:19.652
그래서 저희가 여기에
 온 거예요


1910
01:06:19.652 --> 01:06:21.215
Well, that's why we're here.

1911
01:06:21.307 --> 01:06:21.487
성경이 좀 망가져서

1912
01:06:21.487 --> 01:06:22.552
The bible kinda got ruined,

1913
01:06:22.642 --> 01:06:22.822
목록에 있는 모든 사람에게
 전화해서 복원해 보려구요


1914
01:06:22.822 --> 01:06:26.591
so we wanna call everyone on the list
 and try to reconstruct it.


1915
01:06:27.730 --> 01:06:27.910
오

1916
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:28.975
Oh.

1917
01:06:30.066 --> 01:06:30.246
너희들 도움이 좀
 필요할 거 같구나


1918
01:06:30.246 --> 01:06:33.980
Well, I think you boys might need
 some help.


1919
01:06:35.988 --> 01:06:36.169
여자애들은 이런 일에 유리하지
 남자와는 달리


1920
01:06:36.169 --> 01:06:39.903
Well, girls have the advantage,
 because girls talk to each other,


1921
01:06:39.992 --> 01:06:40.173
서로 얘기를 하거든

1922
01:06:40.173 --> 01:06:42.697
and don't kid yourself,
 they talk about the penis.


1923
01:06:42.787 --> 01:06:42.967
페니스 모양, 사이즈,
 구부러진 각도


1924
01:06:42.967 --> 01:06:46.204
Penis size, penis shape,
 the angle of the bend.


1925
01:06:46.542 --> 01:06:46.722
너흰 못 알아차려도
 여자들은 항상 얘길하지


1926
01:06:46.722 --> 01:06:48.249
Whether it winks at you. They talk.

1927
01:06:48.335 --> 01:06:48.515
여자와 사랑을 나누려면
 진심으로 아껴줘야 해


1928
01:06:48.515 --> 01:06:52.249
Now, to really make love to a woman,
 you gotta really care about her.


1929
01:06:52.339 --> 01:06:52.519
섹스는 정말 좋은 거야
 네가 사랑하는
 사람과 하면 더 좋지


1930
01:06:52.519 --> 01:06:56.289
But...Hey, sex is great, but sex with
 someone you love? That's awesome.


1931
01:06:56.385 --> 01:06:56.565
와 정말 조예가
 깊으시네요


1932
01:06:56.565 --> 01:06:58.128
Dude, that is so profound.

1933
01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:58.400
내가 말했잖아

1934
01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.383
Telling you.

1935
01:06:59.471 --> 01:06:59.651
그럼 지금 혼자있어

1936
01:06:59.651 --> 01:07:01.345
Yeah, definitely gets lonely on the road.

1937
01:07:01.431 --> 01:07:01.612
물론이지
 난 온갖 종류의 음식을 써봤어


1938
01:07:01.612 --> 01:07:03.969
Sure, I made love to all kinds
 of different food groups.


1939
01:07:04.059 --> 01:07:04.239
땅콩 버터 샌드위치
 써 봤나?


1940
01:07:04.239 --> 01:07:06.265
Did you ever try making love
 to a peanut-butter sandwich?


1941
01:07:06.353 --> 01:07:06.533
그만한 게 없어

1942
01:07:06.533 --> 01:07:07.633
Nothing comes close.

1943
01:07:07.729 --> 01:07:07.910
뭐라구요?

1944
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:08.809
What?

1945
01:07:08.897 --> 01:07:09.077
뼈없는 뒷다리 햄이 좋긴
 하지만 그건 준비할 게 많아


1946
01:07:09.077 --> 01:07:13.145
Well, maybe a deboned ham hock,
 but that takes a whole lot of prep.


1947
01:07:13.736 --> 01:07:13.917
무릎을 꿇게

1948
01:07:13.917 --> 01:07:14.816
Bend your knees.

1949
01:07:14.904 --> 01:07:15.084
다음에 빰을 맞으면
 인디언처럼 앉아 보게


1950
01:07:15.084 --> 01:07:17.691
Next time you spank it, sit Indian-style.

1951
01:07:17.907 --> 01:07:18.087
앞으로 한 몇 백년은
 물어보러 안 와도 될 걸세


1952
01:07:18.087 --> 01:07:19.651
You won't come, not in a million years.

1953
01:07:19.742 --> 01:07:19.923
우리의 성기는
 악기와 같아


1954
01:07:19.923 --> 01:07:22.447
MAN: Our sex organs
 are like musical instruments.


1955
01:07:22.537 --> 01:07:22.717
누구든지 호른을
 연주할 수는 있지


1956
01:07:22.717 --> 01:07:24.446
Sure, you can have any technician

 하지만 왜?


2105
01:13:01.528 --> 01:13:04.830
Really? But why?

2106
01:13:06.175 --> 01:13:06.322
널 위해서
 섹스때문에 그러는 건 아냐


2107
01:13:06.322 --> 01:13:09.508
I'm in this for you.
 I'm not in it just to have sex.


2108
01:13:10.012 --> 01:13:10.156
사실 난 널 위해
 한 거였는데


2109
01:13:10.156 --> 01:13:12.883
Well, I realised that
I'm in this for you,

2110
01:13:12.973 --> 01:13:13.116
하지만 서약이 방해가 된다면
 널 위하는 게 아니잖아


2111
01:13:13.116 --> 01:13:16.805
and if the pledge gets in the way of that,
 then how good can it really be?


2112
01:13:16.894 --> 01:13:17.033
우리 둘에게 서로의 관점으로
 볼 수 있는 좋은 기회같아


2113
01:13:17.033 --> 01:13:21.603
Sounds like a good basis for the two of us
 to just relax and see what happens.


2114
01:13:21.982 --> 01:13:22.118
나 책 샀어

2115
01:13:22.118 --> 01:13:24.556
Look. I bought a book.

2116
01:13:25.402 --> 01:13:25.536
내 생각엔
 1페이지부터 시작해서


2117
01:13:25.536 --> 01:13:27.395
I was thinking that we could

2118
01:13:27.488 --> 01:13:27.620
이번 주 동안 얼마나
 할 수 있는지 해보는 게
 재밌을 거 같아


2119
01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:30.905
start on page one
 and then see how far we get this weekend.


2120
01:13:31.743 --> 01:13:31.872
1장은 역할극이야

2121
01:13:31.872 --> 01:13:33.901
The first three chapters are foreplay.

2122
01:13:33.995 --> 01:13:34.122
와

2123
01:13:34.122 --> 01:13:35.074
Wow.

2124
01:13:35.789 --> 01:13:35.915
사실 나도 읽던
 책이 있어


2125
01:13:35.915 --> 01:13:39.039
You know, I've actually been
 reading a book, as well.


2126
01:13:39.125 --> 01:13:39.249
혹시 폭풍혀라고
 들어봤어?


2127
01:13:39.249 --> 01:13:42.162
Have you ever heard of the tongue tornado?

2128
01:13:42.754 --> 01:13:42.875
어서 가자

2129
01:13:42.875 --> 01:13:44.296
Okay, let's go.

2130
01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:48.876
원래 재밌어야 하는데

2131
01:13:48.876 --> 01:13:50.918
This is supposed to be fun.

2132
01:13:51.304 --> 01:13:51.419
난 재밌어

2133
01:13:51.419 --> 01:13:52.846
This isn't fun.

2134
01:13:53.014 --> 01:13:53.128
우선 기다려봐
 넌 지혜를 가졌잖아


2135
01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:56.181
Just you wait. 
You possess wisdom now.

2136
01:13:56.935 --> 01:13:57.045
책을 믿어

2137
01:13:57.045 --> 01:13:58.596
Trust in the book.

2138
01:14:03.192 --> 01:14:03.298
그게 도대체 무슨 말이야?
 내가 끈적거린다고 생각해?


2139
01:14:03.298 --> 01:14:07.237
I mean, what does that mean, anyway?
 Do you think I'm too clingy?


2140
01:14:07.446 --> 01:14:07.549
아냐
 물론 아냐


2141
01:14:07.549 --> 01:14:09.688
No. No, of course not.

2142
01:14:10.032 --> 01:14:10.133
포커 할 줄 알아?

2143
01:14:10.133 --> 01:14:11.657
Do you even know how to play poker?

2144
01:14:11.742 --> 01:14:11.842
나도 알아

2145
01:14:11.842 --> 01:14:12.774
KATIE: I know the game.

2146
01:14:12.868 --> 01:14:12.967
내가 지면 옷을 벗을게

2147
01:14:12.967 --> 01:14:16.617
And I tell you what,
 if I lose, I'll take off all my clothes.

 ASHLEY: Nice.


2151
01:14:20.793 --> 01:14:20.886
내가 지면?

2152
01:14:20.886 --> 01:14:22.287
And if I lose?

2153
01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:22.762
나한테 사과 해

2154
01:14:22.762 --> 01:14:24.462
You apologise to me.

2155
01:14:25.674 --> 01:14:25.764
-뭘 사과해? 속인 거?
 -그래


2156
01:14:25.764 --> 01:14:27.750
- For what? Blowing you off?
 - KATIE: Yes.


2157
01:14:27.843 --> 01:14:27.931
그걸론 부족해
 내 첫경험이었어


2158
01:14:27.931 --> 01:14:30.630
If it's not enough,
it was my first time.

2159
01:14:30.846 --> 01:14:30.932
난 더 대우받을만 해

2160
01:14:30.932 --> 01:14:31.877

만약 내가 이기면
 사과는 물론


2163
01:14:34.308 --> 01:14:37.759
But if I win,
 not only do you apologise to me,

01:14:37.853 --> 01:14:37.934
벗고 눈 속을 뛸 각오해

2170

Start stripping, sweetheart.

You better hope for a
five on the river, baby.

5를 가졌어!

01:19:40.241 --> 01:19:40.277
And? What did you decide?

2261
01:19:40.277 --> 01:19:43.276
그래서?
 정리는 됐어?


2262
01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:46.617
Gibbs says that Stifler has to sit on
 a foam rubber doughnut for six weeks.


2263
01:19:46.617 --> 01:19:50.319
깁스가 그러는데 스티플러는
 6개월동안 도넛 모양
 고무의자를 써야 한대


2264
01:19:50.376 --> 01:19:50.414
And he says they're talking about
 amputating his feet from frostbite.


2265
01:19:50.414 --> 01:19:54.198
그리고 동상때문에
 발을 자를지도 모른대


2266
01:19:54.255 --> 01:19:54.292
Gibbs is a liar.
 Stifler doesn't need amputation.


2267
01:19:54.292 --> 01:19:57.459
깁스는 거짓말쟁이야
 스티플러는 다리 안 잘라


2268
01:19:57.508 --> 01:19:57.546
That's too bad. 
I got an A in Shop.

2269
01:19:57.546 --> 01:20:00.080
아쉽다
 공작 시간에 A 받았는데

(SNORTS)

2271
01:20:05.890 --> 01:20:05.929
Oh, my. Was that a snort?

2272
01:20:05.929 --> 01:20:07.763
코에서 난 소리야?

2273
01:20:22.782 --> 01:20:22.822
Come to gloat?

2274
01:20:22.822 --> 01:20:24.067
고소하냐?

2275
01:20:24.117 --> 01:20:24.157
No. Just looking for a fag.

2276
01:20:24.157 --> 01:20:26.280
아니
 담배 찾으러 온 거야


2277
01:20:26.411 --> 01:20:26.451
Just 'cause I took a moose pickle up my ass
 doesn't mean I'm gay.


2278
01:20:26.451 --> 01:20:30.151
무스한테 당했다고
 내가 게이가 된 건 아냐


2279
01:20:30.206 --> 01:20:30.246
Very funny. How's your bum?

2280
01:20:30.246 --> 01:20:33.081
재밌네
 엉덩이는 어때?


2281
01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:33.166
Feels like I gave birth to a mayonnaise jar,
 but thanks for asking.


2282
01:20:33.166 --> 01:20:37.252
엉덩이로 마요네즈 병을
 낳은 거 같아, 물어봐줘서 고마워


2283
01:20:38.005 --> 01:20:38.046
Hey, I heard about your boyfriend.
 That really sucks.


2284
01:20:38.046 --> 01:20:41.165
네 남친 얘기 들었어
 안 됐더라


2285
01:20:41.216 --> 01:20:41.257
Yeah. I thought only high school boys
 were jerks.


2286
01:20:41.257 --> 01:20:44.461
난 고등학교 애들만
 싸가지 없는 줄 알았어


2287
01:20:44.512 --> 01:20:44.553
It turns out they never outgrow it.

2288
01:20:44.553 --> 01:20:46.261
결국 남자들은
 다 똑같다는 게 밝혀졌지


2289
01:20:46.305 --> 01:20:46.346
Lmogen, no offence,
 and you're the most mature girl I know,


2290
01:20:46.346 --> 01:20:50.004
나쁘게 듣지마, 이모진
 넌 내가 아는 애 중 가장 성숙해


2291
01:20:50.684 --> 01:20:50.726
but a 24-year-old dude isn't gonna take
 a high-school girl seriously.


2292
01:20:50.726 --> 01:20:54.640
그렇다고 24살 짜리가
 고등학교 애를 진지하게
 생각하진 않아


2293
01:20:54.688 --> 01:20:54.730
I suppose not.

2294
01:20:54.730 --> 01:20:56.098
난 그렇게 생각 안 해

2295
01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:57.232
You wanna sit down?

2296
01:20:57.232 --> 01:20:58.933
앉을래?

2297
01:20:59.609 --> 01:20:59.651
What for?

2298
01:20:59.651 --> 01:21:00.896
왜?

2299
01:21:01.027 --> 01:21:01.070
I just thought we could both use
 a friend right now.


2300
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:03.980
우리 둘이 지금 서로
 친구가 필요한 거 같아서


2301
01:21:16.668 --> 01:21:16.711
Stifler.

2302
01:21:16.711 --> 01:21:17.742
스티플러

2303
01:21:17.794 --> 01:21:17.837
My bad. Reflex.

2304
01:21:17.837 --> 01:21:19.379
미안
 반사 작용이라


2305

(LAUGHS)

2306
01:21:22.465 --> 01:21:22.509
ROB: I'm sorry.

2307
01:21:22.509 --> 01:21:23.884
미안해

2308
01:21:24.258 --> 01:21:24.302
You have to make your own decisions.

2309
01:21:24.302 --> 01:21:25.583
너도 결정을 해야 해

2310
01:21:25.634 --> 01:21:25.678
You know, I just...
 I thought we had something.


2311
01:21:25.678 --> 01:21:29.628
난 아직 우리 사이에
 뭔가 있다고 생각해


2312
01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:29.724
We did.

2313
01:21:29.724 --> 01:21:30.924
그래 맞아

2314
01:21:32.599 --> 01:21:32.644
We do.

2315
01:21:32.644 --> 01:21:33.796
아직 감정이
 남아 있어


2316
01:21:35.185 --> 01:21:35.230
I was scared.

2317
01:21:35.230 --> 01:21:36.643
난 무서웠어

2318
01:21:37.355 --> 01:21:37.400
Of what?

2319
01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.599
뭐가 무서워?

2320
01:21:42.526 --> 01:21:42.571
I really like you.

2321
01:21:42.571 --> 01:21:44.150
내가 널 너무 좋아해서

2322
01:21:45.654 --> 01:21:45.700
And I want it to be special.

2323
01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:47.978
그래서 특별했으면 좋겠어

2324
01:21:49.408 --> 01:21:49.453
I guess I just wanted to be ready.

2325
01:21:49.453 --> 01:21:52.573
내가 준비가 되기만을
 기다린 거 같아


2326
01:21:54.579 --> 01:21:54.625
So you almost had sex with Stifler
 so you'd be ready for me.


2327
01:21:54.625 --> 01:21:58.991
스티플러랑 거의 섹스할 뻔
 했으니 네가 준비가 됐다고
 생각하는 거구나


2328
01:22:00.418 --> 01:22:00.464
Yeah.

2329
01:22:00.464 --> 01:22:01.496
응

That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

2331
01:22:02.466 --> 01:22:05.255
내가 들어본 말 중
 가장 바보같은 말이야


2332
01:22:06.341 --> 01:22:06.388
Well, I heard you got some practise.

2333
01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:08.913
글쎄.. 네가 연습을
 했다고 들었어


2334
01:22:09.594 --> 01:22:09.641
You know, the truth is,
 is nothing happened.


2335
01:22:09.641 --> 01:22:12.510
사실 아무 일도
 없었어


2336
01:22:14.474 --> 01:22:14.521
I didn't want it
to be random like that.

2337
01:22:14.521 --> 01:22:17.308
그렇게 아무 하고나
 하고 싶지 않았어


2338
01:22:17.476 --> 01:22:17.524
And...

2339
01:22:17.524 --> 01:22:18.673
그리고

2340
01:22:21.438 --> 01:22:21.486
I couldn't picture my first time
 being with anybody else but you.

네가 아닌 다른 사람과의
 첫경험은 안된다고 생각해

Why do you hook up with assholes
 like Scott Stifler anyway?

 똑같구나

 트로피 같겠지

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:44.906
You don't care about me.
 You just wanna sleep with me,

01:23:44.906 --> 01:23:47.362
넌 날 신경쓰지도 않잖아
 같이 자고 싶을 뿐


2366
01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:47.450
because you think
 it's some sort of status symbol.


2367
01:23:47.450 --> 01:23:50.285
왜냐면 그 게 뭔가
 신분의 상징이라 생각하니까

 about how I don't care about you


2412
01:25:03.821 --> 01:25:07.356
아까 네가
 난 널 신경 안 쓰고


2413
01:25:07.391 --> 01:25:07.450
and you're just a trophy,
 that's actually not true.


2414
01:25:07.450 --> 01:25:10.202
트로피처럼 생각한다고 했잖아
 그건 사실이 아냐


2415
01:25:10.227 --> 01:25:10.286
I really like you.
 We went to elementary school together.


2416
01:25:10.286 --> 01:25:14.830
난 네가 정말 좋아
 우린 초등학교도 같이 나왔어


2417
01:25:15.066 --> 01:25:15.125
<i>I remember when you sang Hey Ya!
 In the sixth-grade talent show.</i>


2418
01:25:15.125 --> 01:25:18.292
6학년 장기 자랑에서 네가
 'Hey Ya!'라는 노래 부른 것도 기억해


2419
01:25:18.319 --> 01:25:18.379
I remember when you fell off the pyramid
 at the homecoming game, freshman year.


2420
01:25:18.379 --> 01:25:22.507
1학년 동창회때 피라미드에서
 떨어진 것도 기억해


2421
01:25:22.531 --> 01:25:22.591
You were so embarrassed, but I didn't care.

2422
01:25:22.591 --> 01:25:25.462
넌 창피해 했지만
 난 상관 안 했어


2423
01:25:25.575 --> 01:25:25.636
I just liked how you played it off
 like it was all part of the routine.


2424
01:25:25.636 --> 01:25:29.336
난 네가 꼭 아무 일 없었다는 듯
 행동하는 게 너무 좋았어


2425
01:25:29.371 --> 01:25:29.431
I mean, yeah, sure, you're a super-hot babe,
 but I actually like you for you.


2426
01:25:29.431 --> 01:25:35.953
네가 정말 섹시하고 이쁘지만
 난 그냥 딱 너라서 좋은 거야


2427
01:25:38.129 --> 01:25:38.190
Look, this may be a shock to you,

2428
01:25:38.190 --> 01:25:40.896
내 말에 놀랄지 모르겠지만

2429
01:25:40.924 --> 01:25:40.985
but I have no idea
what I'm doing with girls.

2430
01:25:40.985 --> 01:25:45.170
나도 내가 여자애들한테
 왜 그러는지 모르겠어


2431
01:25:46.721 --> 01:25:46.783
But I really wanna learn.
 You just give me a chance.


2432
01:25:46.783 --> 01:25:50.053
나한테 기회를 줘

2433
01:25:50.975 --> 01:25:51.037
That's all I'm asking.

2434
01:25:51.037 --> 01:25:52.848
내가 원하는 건
 오직 그 거 뿐이야


2435
01:25:53.561 --> 01:25:53.623
And I guarantee that
 I will make it my life's mission


2436
01:25:53.623 --> 01:25:57.621
나의 인생의 목표가
 너를 모든 방면에 있어서


2437
01:25:57.648 --> 01:25:57.711
to satisfy you in every way possible.

2438
01:25:57.711 --> 01:26:00.980
만족 시키는 거라고
 장담할 수 있어


2439
01:26:37.604 --> 01:26:37.669
- Let's go back to the...
 - To the cabin.


2440
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:40.224
-어서 다시 돌아가자
 - 그래 산장으로


2441
01:27:37.579 --> 01:27:37.648
Dude. You forgot to sign it.

2442
01:27:37.648 --> 01:27:40.282
사인하는 거 잊었어

2443
01:27:47.838 --> 01:27:47.908
You sure we can't just keep it
 for one more year?


2444
01:27:47.908 --> 01:27:50.481
1년 더 가지고 있으면
 안 되겠지?


2445
01:27:50.507 --> 01:27:50.577
No, guys, it's someone else's turn.

2446
01:27:50.577 --> 01:27:52.499
안 돼
 이젠 다른 사람 차례야

콘돔 가져왔어?

2476

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:28.299
뭐?

2478
01:29:28.311 --> 01:29:28.388
I wet the bed until
I was 13 years old, okay?
