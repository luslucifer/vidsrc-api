1
00:04:15.416 --> 00:04:18.335
You're awake. What a relief!

2
00:04:30.723 --> 00:04:34.435
You're wondering where you are, right?

3
00:04:40.775 --> 00:04:43.277
- Um...
- I know the feeling.


4
00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:47.448
I don't know either.

5
00:04:50.076 --> 00:04:54.288
I suddenly found
myself in this weird place.


6
00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:59.752
That kid won't talk.

7
00:05:03.798 --> 00:05:05.507
You were unconscious.

8
00:05:10.096 --> 00:05:13.390
So I just waited
for you to come to.

9
00:05:33.745 --> 00:05:34.912
What?

10
00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.583
Your phone? Wallet?

11
00:05:40.084 --> 00:05:43.337
- Yeah.
- Well, they're gone.


12
00:05:44.338 --> 00:05:45.757
It sucks.

13
00:06:02.398 --> 00:06:04.233
What did you do?

14
00:06:09.196 --> 00:06:10.948
A crime, maybe?

15
00:06:15.202 --> 00:06:18.122
No, of course you didn't.

16
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:22.334
Me neither.

17
00:07:07.922 --> 00:07:11.258
Excuse me! C
-Can you wait a moment?

18
00:07:11.425 --> 00:07:14.761
Er... What is this place?

19
00:07:15.346 --> 00:07:19.100
We don't... know what's... going on...

20
00:07:19.558 --> 00:07:21.978
Or what this room is, or...

21
00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:26.732
S
-Sorry.

22
00:08:26.918 --> 00:08:29.503
He's dead. He's dead. He's dead!

23
00:09:07.499 --> 00:09:09.001
Hello.

24
00:09:10.794 --> 00:09:12.713
So who...

25
00:09:14.798 --> 00:09:16.633
are you people?

26
00:09:45.537 --> 00:09:46.705
Screw this...

27
00:09:48.582 --> 00:09:50.334
Screw this!

28
00:10:37.173 --> 00:10:38.799
You would've died.

29
00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.561
What was that...

30
00:11:10.456 --> 00:11:13.041
If you don't wanna die, move.

31
00:11:22.384 --> 00:11:23.802
What now?

32
00:11:28.599 --> 00:11:30.351
I'm going.

33
00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:58.772
So who exactly...

34
00:13:00.482 --> 00:13:02.150
are you people?

35
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.154
Who are we?

36
00:13:06.822 --> 00:13:11.159
I'm Asako. Asako Kai.

37
00:13:13.954 --> 00:13:15.914
Oh, our names?

38
00:13:17.123 --> 00:13:18.667
I'm Shinji Ochi.

39
00:13:21.212 --> 00:13:23.880
Yuichi Goto.

40
00:13:29.803 --> 00:13:30.971
And you are?

41
00:13:32.723 --> 00:13:33.807
Ide.

42
00:13:46.945 --> 00:13:48.864
Chiharu Uno.

43
00:13:52.993 --> 00:13:57.414
Do you remember anything,
like where you came from?


44
00:14:03.587 --> 00:14:05.422
I was at work...

45
00:14:08.008 --> 00:14:09.343
A convenience store.

46
00:14:10.802 --> 00:14:14.973
Late at night. 
I finished and went home,

47
00:14:15.098 --> 00:14:18.560
had a drink, and must've passed out.

48
00:14:21.438 --> 00:14:22.773
And you, Ide?

49
00:14:24.941 --> 00:14:26.109
Beats me.

50
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.695
"Beats me"?

51
00:14:38.289 --> 00:14:42.459
I was at home too, sleeping I think.

52
00:14:43.294 --> 00:14:46.380
We were brought here while asleep?

53
00:14:47.255 --> 00:14:49.425
Or we're still dreaming?

54
00:14:50.342 --> 00:14:51.427
Dreaming?

55
00:14:51.968 --> 00:14:53.804
"Brought here"?

56
00:14:55.055 --> 00:14:57.474
By who? For what?

57
00:15:01.478 --> 00:15:05.816
There... must be cameras.
Is this some TV show?!


58
00:15:08.068 --> 00:15:12.030
Somebody! Answer me! 
How could you...

59
00:15:12.072 --> 00:15:16.910
How could you lock me in here?!
I've done nothing wrong!


60
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.751
Shut the hell up.

61
00:15:38.139 --> 00:15:39.224
Sure.

62
00:16:15.218 --> 00:16:17.554
Another one of these rooms...

63
00:16:18.138 --> 00:16:20.641
Do they go on forever?

64
00:16:51.547 --> 00:16:53.632
Hey! Wait a moment.

65
00:16:56.009 --> 00:16:59.680
You won't check the other hatches?

66
00:17:00.055 --> 00:17:05.894
One might lead to an exit,
so shouldn't we try...


67
00:17:09.355 --> 00:17:11.024
Not again.

68
00:17:47.143 --> 00:17:48.562
Gimme your boots.

69
00:17:52.733 --> 00:17:56.987
Hey... Can we slow down for a second?

70
00:17:57.821 --> 00:17:59.490
The other one too.

71
00:18:04.202 --> 00:18:08.915
If we keep using our boots like this,
we'll end up with none...


72
00:18:08.957 --> 00:18:11.001
Just a thought.

73
00:18:11.042 --> 00:18:12.043
You go then.

74
00:18:14.129 --> 00:18:16.840
No, I wasn't criticizing you...

75
00:18:16.882 --> 00:18:18.634
Then shut your mouth.

76
00:18:19.676 --> 00:18:20.761
Move.

77
00:18:36.067 --> 00:18:38.695
179, 7...

78
00:18:54.586 --> 00:18:57.923
This won't open either. It's no use.

79
00:19:01.009 --> 00:19:06.848
Is there some kind of rule?
Why they open, or don't.


80
00:19:10.101 --> 00:19:11.436
Let's move.

81
00:19:32.583 --> 00:19:33.750
What?

82
00:19:34.626 --> 00:19:35.877
Numbers.

83
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:37.503
Numbers?

84
00:19:39.547 --> 00:19:42.843
Well,
I don't know what they mean though.


85
00:19:46.554 --> 00:19:52.060
Actually, that room with
the needle trap had numbers too.


86
00:19:52.853 --> 00:19:53.937
What are they?

87
00:19:54.896 --> 00:19:58.066
Like an IP address or something?

88
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:10.536
Are they in every passageway?

89
00:20:12.038 --> 00:20:13.874
I don't know.

90
00:21:08.344 --> 00:21:09.637
Thank goodness.

91
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.517
Hey, I'm Ando.

92
00:21:20.023 --> 00:21:22.108
I'm a company executive.

93
00:21:22.984 --> 00:21:26.321
When I came to
and found myself in here,

94
00:21:26.487 --> 00:21:27.864
I felt hopeless.

95
00:21:31.743 --> 00:21:32.660
A child?

96
00:21:34.245 --> 00:21:35.538
Wait, a child?

97
00:21:39.793 --> 00:21:41.627
Why bring a child?

98
00:21:46.216 --> 00:21:49.845
Er, An... Ando...

99
00:21:51.346 --> 00:21:53.681
Shall we get out? Let's go!

100
00:21:54.099 --> 00:21:56.226
This isn't a rescue.

101
00:21:57.268 --> 00:21:58.603
Pardon me?

102
00:22:00.355 --> 00:22:03.649
We all woke up in here too.

103
00:22:04.735 --> 00:22:07.028
We're looking for a way out.

104
00:22:11.074 --> 00:22:12.492
You are?

105
00:22:13.785 --> 00:22:15.453
Yes, pretty much.

106
00:22:20.666 --> 00:22:22.502
You don't say...

107
00:22:35.807 --> 00:22:37.058
Up there?

108
00:22:40.771 --> 00:22:43.273
We're really going up there?

109
00:22:44.065 --> 00:22:46.526
I'd rather not, but Ide...

110
00:22:48.069 --> 00:22:52.657
He just keeps going.
All we can do is follow.


111
00:22:56.286 --> 00:23:00.748
That's going to be tough...

112
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:08.756
Climbing up there
would be a strain for you.


113
00:23:09.132 --> 00:23:11.467
I'm talking about the kid.

114
00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.095
Right, Chiharu?

115
00:23:16.764 --> 00:23:18.349
What's your problem?

116
00:23:24.689 --> 00:23:25.857
Strip off.

117
00:23:27.025 --> 00:23:28.443
You too.

118
00:23:29.861 --> 00:23:31.362
Just do it.

119
00:23:38.536 --> 00:23:41.206
Ochi, your shirt.

120
00:23:48.254 --> 00:23:49.505
Chiharu.

121
00:24:18.784 --> 00:24:21.287
Carefully! Carefully!

122
00:24:23.123 --> 00:24:27.377
Steady me, Ochi! Ochi! Ochi!

123
00:24:28.544 --> 00:24:30.838
Don't swing me!

124
00:24:38.388 --> 00:24:41.724
How... How many rooms is this now?

125
00:24:45.186 --> 00:24:49.357
Don't "Huh" me. 
How many rooms?

126
00:24:52.443 --> 00:24:55.196
This must be the eighth one.

127
00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.329
We just keep going on and on?

128
00:25:04.164 --> 00:25:08.001
Well, if there are traps,
we can't go on.


129
00:25:08.293 --> 00:25:09.502
You know better?

130
00:25:09.544 --> 00:25:12.463
No, not at all! 
As much as anybody.

131
00:25:12.505 --> 00:25:14.007
Oh really?

132
00:25:25.936 --> 00:25:28.604
What's wrong with you?! Damn.

133
00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.193
It seems it's not an exit.

134
00:25:33.234 --> 00:25:34.819
Checked for traps?

135
00:25:35.445 --> 00:25:36.612
No.

136
00:25:59.552 --> 00:26:01.054
Seems safe to me.

137
00:26:01.096 --> 00:26:02.680
Why come back?

138
00:26:04.265 --> 00:26:06.101
Why ask why?

139
00:26:06.226 --> 00:26:08.394
If it's safe, go in.

140
00:26:16.277 --> 00:26:20.031
He thought you'd go first. Right, Goto?

141
00:26:22.492 --> 00:26:25.078
I'll go first. I'll go.

142
00:27:01.072 --> 00:27:02.907
Chiharu...?

143
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:20.716
What's this?!

144
00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:26.056
What is it?!

145
00:27:26.639 --> 00:27:28.974
Look up! Up!

146
00:27:41.362 --> 00:27:44.282
Hatches! Hatches! Hatches!

147
00:27:49.036 --> 00:27:50.746
It won't open!

148
00:27:52.707 --> 00:27:55.293
Get down! Get down! Get down!

149
00:28:08.723 --> 00:28:11.892
Open the floor hatch! Open it!

150
00:28:12.017 --> 00:28:13.228
The floor hatch!

151
00:28:14.019 --> 00:28:16.147
Goto! Goto, open it!

152
00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:17.523
I'm sorry!

153
00:28:18.816 --> 00:28:19.817
Move!

154
00:28:21.527 --> 00:28:22.862
I'm sorry!

155
00:28:27.617 --> 00:28:28.618
Go!

156
00:28:30.161 --> 00:28:31.662
Out of my way!

157
00:28:32.413 --> 00:28:33.331
Let's go.

158
00:28:34.415 --> 00:28:36.626
Hurry! Hurry, hurry!

159
00:28:36.667 --> 00:28:37.835
Snap out of it.

160
00:28:38.336 --> 00:28:40.713
Move! Move!

161
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.562
Ide, calm down!

162
00:28:56.646 --> 00:28:59.690
We nearly died because of you!

163
00:28:59.732 --> 00:29:04.028
Hey! You! Come on, no violence!

164
00:29:16.332 --> 00:29:19.585
Stop it! Where did doing that get us?

165
00:29:19.794 --> 00:29:24.340
You rushing headlong
is what put us in danger!


166
00:29:24.382 --> 00:29:26.217
Like some little brat!

167
00:29:26.884 --> 00:29:29.554
What? More violence?

168
00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:31.514
You are a little brat!

169
00:29:32.682 --> 00:29:36.936
He's saying,
moving recklessly will get us killed...


170
00:29:36.977 --> 00:29:38.313
What'd you say?

171
00:29:40.022 --> 00:29:41.816
Oh, nothing...

172
00:30:36.871 --> 00:30:38.623
Thanks for before.

173
00:30:45.838 --> 00:30:50.009
You... saved my life.

174
00:31:08.361 --> 00:31:10.571
The needle trap...

175
00:31:11.614 --> 00:31:14.199
The numbers for that room.

176
00:31:15.493 --> 00:31:16.827
Remember them?

177
00:31:17.202 --> 00:31:18.621
Numbers?

178
00:31:24.502 --> 00:31:30.090
1... 179 762 554.

179
00:31:30.132 --> 00:31:33.719
179 762 554, I think.

180
00:31:50.903 --> 00:31:51.821
A button?

181
00:32:30.735 --> 00:32:31.902
What?

182
00:32:37.199 --> 00:32:40.953
Chiharu... How old are you?

183
00:32:48.836 --> 00:32:50.671
I'm 28.

184
00:32:53.173 --> 00:32:55.342
No, I just turned 29.

185
00:33:03.434 --> 00:33:04.852
You're a grown-up.

186
00:33:06.937 --> 00:33:08.188
A grown-up?

187
00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.362
I... hate grown-ups.

188
00:33:19.492 --> 00:33:20.826
Oh...

189
00:33:53.859 --> 00:33:56.529
I hate grown-ups.

190
00:34:18.425 --> 00:34:20.010
Is that...

191
00:34:23.848 --> 00:34:25.558
This maths is hard, so--

192
00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.101
Give me that.

193
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.689
Yeah... That's right.

194
00:34:40.364 --> 00:34:42.157
This is the needle room.

195
00:34:56.839 --> 00:34:58.591
You thought of this?

196
00:35:01.176 --> 00:35:02.595
Way to go.

197
00:35:07.432 --> 00:35:08.768
What is it?

198
00:35:11.646 --> 00:35:15.149
The pattern of the
numbers in the hatches.


199
00:35:16.984 --> 00:35:18.569
What does that mean?

200
00:35:18.819 --> 00:35:23.658
Sorry, um, I think we might be
able to avoid the trapped rooms.


201
00:35:23.741 --> 00:35:25.367
Avoid them?

202
00:35:27.828 --> 00:35:29.079
Really?

203
00:35:29.914 --> 00:35:32.583
Oh, it wasn't me, it was Chiharu.

204
00:35:35.085 --> 00:35:36.712
So, how can we...

205
00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:46.556
When a room has a trap,
there's always a prime number.


206
00:35:46.597 --> 00:35:49.850
Sorry, what's a prime number?

207
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:57.900
It can only be divided
by 1 and itself. Like 2, 3, 5, and 7.


208
00:35:58.025 --> 00:36:00.945
Okay... K
-Keep going.

209
00:36:03.614 --> 00:36:07.201
The room with the needle trap had 179.

210
00:36:07.577 --> 00:36:11.121
The one with the ceiling trap had 199.

211
00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:13.916
The other trapped rooms,

212
00:36:13.916 --> 00:36:17.837
if I remember correctly,
also had prime numbers.


213
00:36:39.066 --> 00:36:43.988
So, they all end in even numbers.

214
00:36:44.905 --> 00:36:46.616
There are no prime numbers.

215
00:36:47.407 --> 00:36:49.619
So, there's no trap?

216
00:36:50.953 --> 00:36:53.831
Well, there are no prime numbers.

217
00:36:54.832 --> 00:36:57.501
That's meaningless.

218
00:36:59.044 --> 00:37:02.131
How can you be sure there's no trap?

219
00:37:03.423 --> 00:37:08.053
What's the point in
listening to a little brat anyway...


220
00:37:22.109 --> 00:37:23.527
Goto! Shoes!

221
00:37:24.862 --> 00:37:26.656
It's probably...

222
00:37:28.323 --> 00:37:29.491
safe.

223
00:37:43.839 --> 00:37:45.424
Goto!

224
00:37:50.637 --> 00:37:52.139
Seems okay.

225
00:37:59.604 --> 00:38:00.981
Wow!

226
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:04.860
Wow wow wow! It's gonna work!

227
00:38:09.614 --> 00:38:11.784
This should take us further.

228
00:38:29.093 --> 00:38:30.677
No prime number!

229
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.228
526, 714, 632.

230
00:38:39.269 --> 00:38:41.856
All even, no primes. We can go.

231
00:38:43.273 --> 00:38:48.946
661, 962, 442.

232
00:38:54.159 --> 00:38:57.371
It has... a prime number.

233
00:38:59.539 --> 00:39:04.544
Which means... traps in all directions?

234
00:39:07.798 --> 00:39:09.133
Go back?

235
00:39:09.466 --> 00:39:11.385
Huh? Go back?!

236
00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:22.772
Huh? It won't open. Why?

237
00:39:22.813 --> 00:39:23.773
What's that?

238
00:39:23.814 --> 00:39:25.232
It won't open!

239
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:30.487
The numbers?
Are they all correct?! Check them again!


240
00:39:51.466 --> 00:39:53.052
It's no good.

241
00:39:55.095 --> 00:39:56.889
Shit.

242
00:39:57.848 --> 00:39:58.891
Shit!

243
00:40:06.606 --> 00:40:08.025
What was that?!

244
00:40:25.084 --> 00:40:26.168
Sound.

245
00:40:27.127 --> 00:40:28.712
It reacts to sound?

246
00:40:28.753 --> 00:40:30.005
To sound?

247
00:40:31.006 --> 00:40:34.426
But it didn't react
to the hatch opening.


248
00:40:50.525 --> 00:40:53.237
Must be set up
not to react to this.

249
00:40:54.321 --> 00:40:56.991
Make no sound, we get through.

250
00:40:58.993 --> 00:41:00.911
Have you gone mad?!

251
00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:04.748
We get through.

252
00:43:09.331 --> 00:43:11.458
Shit! My leg! My leg!

253
00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.917
It's only shallow.

254
00:43:13.377 --> 00:43:15.295
Shallow my ass!

255
00:43:18.132 --> 00:43:19.424
I
-I'm sorry!

256
00:43:19.508 --> 00:43:20.717
Ow!

257
00:43:20.759 --> 00:43:24.513
You're not hurt, I am!
What were you thinking?!


258
00:43:24.554 --> 00:43:26.140
I didn't mean to--

259
00:43:26.181 --> 00:43:27.641
Yes you did!

260
00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.769
Are you... one of them?!

261
00:43:32.104 --> 00:43:35.274
Why'd you shut us in here?! Tell me!

262
00:43:35.315 --> 00:43:36.400
You're wrong!

263
00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:37.609
Ando!

264
00:43:38.235 --> 00:43:40.654
What's... What's this all for?!

265
00:43:41.405 --> 00:43:42.489
Don't blame me.

266
00:43:42.572 --> 00:43:44.574
It's all your fault!

267
00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:50.955
A dead weight like you
won't get ahead anywhere!


268
00:43:51.956 --> 00:43:55.502
I apologized. Isn't that enough?

269
00:43:56.753 --> 00:43:58.588
You piece of shit!

270
00:44:03.343 --> 00:44:09.599
Thanks to this loser here,
I nearly died, dammit!


271
00:44:44.759 --> 00:44:45.885
A cube?

272
00:44:51.975 --> 00:44:53.393
Hey, this is...

273
00:44:54.769 --> 00:44:56.355
What are you up to?

274
00:44:56.646 --> 00:44:58.898
Hey, Ando, this is...

275
00:45:00.317 --> 00:45:02.569
It says 4.5 on each side.

276
00:45:03.528 --> 00:45:08.783
These walls are about 4.5 meters long,
so are these all rooms?


277
00:45:11.411 --> 00:45:12.746
Say what?

278
00:45:17.209 --> 00:45:18.668
A structural plan?

279
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.296
Yeah, it's a rough plan!

280
00:45:27.886 --> 00:45:30.054
You did it. You did. You.

281
00:45:31.223 --> 00:45:33.558
Unlike a loser I could name.

282
00:46:06.132 --> 00:46:08.385
It's a trap! Don't inhale!

283
00:46:09.428 --> 00:46:10.762
Forget that!

284
00:46:12.013 --> 00:46:13.097
Hurry!

285
00:46:13.557 --> 00:46:14.933
Let me go!

286
00:46:20.647 --> 00:46:22.399
Why a trap?!

287
00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:25.652
There was no prime.

288
00:46:26.653 --> 00:46:28.447
You said it was safe.

289
00:46:28.613 --> 00:46:31.741
But trapped rooms
definitely have primes.


290
00:46:31.783 --> 00:46:36.705
That drawing...
must be a clue for getting out of here.


291
00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:40.917
Hey. Do you know what it meant?

292
00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:46.047
Cubes grouped together,
to form a larger cube.


293
00:46:46.423 --> 00:46:48.342
Like this room, but huge.

294
00:46:48.717 --> 00:46:52.346
There were also some
kind of narrow gaps too.


295
00:46:52.679 --> 00:46:54.806
And numbers.

296
00:46:55.765 --> 00:46:58.685
25 and 27 on each side.

297
00:46:58.768 --> 00:47:02.231
Maybe rows of 25 or 27 rooms.

298
00:47:02.439 --> 00:47:03.523
And an exit?!

299
00:47:04.148 --> 00:47:05.525
I didn't see one.

300
00:47:05.567 --> 00:47:08.445
That's the only thing that matters!

301
00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:12.031
But it means the rooms aren't infinite.

302
00:47:12.073 --> 00:47:15.201
There must be some way to get out.

303
00:47:17.203 --> 00:47:18.372
I think.

304
00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:35.597
All we can do is keep going, right?

305
00:47:36.723 --> 00:47:39.225
I'll check the numbers.

306
00:48:19.516 --> 00:48:21.184
What's going on?

307
00:48:25.564 --> 00:48:27.482
What does this mean?!

308
00:48:29.233 --> 00:48:30.819
We came back.

309
00:48:33.112 --> 00:48:35.114
We came all the way back.

310
00:48:36.074 --> 00:48:38.743
To the first room with that corpse!

311
00:48:41.245 --> 00:48:42.747
We came back?

312
00:48:43.582 --> 00:48:44.958
How can that be?!

313
00:48:44.999 --> 00:48:46.668
It's no good.

314
00:48:48.086 --> 00:48:51.881
We risked our lives and went on...
for nothing.


315
00:48:53.342 --> 00:48:55.259
It was all for nothing!

316
00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:58.262
We can't get out!

317
00:48:58.304 --> 00:49:00.223
Shut up, loser!

318
00:49:04.644 --> 00:49:05.895
Knock it off.

319
00:49:07.439 --> 00:49:08.523
Let's go.

320
00:49:11.067 --> 00:49:13.987
We followed you and ended up here.

321
00:49:14.028 --> 00:49:15.238
Go on alone!

322
00:49:15.279 --> 00:49:17.449
Wait! We're not ready.

323
00:49:17.491 --> 00:49:18.617
There's no time.

324
00:49:18.658 --> 00:49:21.453
You'll die alone. Game over!

325
00:49:21.495 --> 00:49:23.162
I'm nearly out of time!

326
00:49:29.711 --> 00:49:31.254
Listen to me.

327
00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:33.632
It makes no sense,

328
00:49:34.716 --> 00:49:36.635
that we returned here.

329
00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:39.971
We went mostly in one direction.

330
00:49:42.557 --> 00:49:43.725
That's true.

331
00:49:46.352 --> 00:49:52.150
We went up and down,
but mostly down, I think.


332
00:49:57.196 --> 00:49:58.865
We didn't come back?

333
00:50:00.575 --> 00:50:02.619
We didn't...

334
00:50:11.545 --> 00:50:14.646
But the rooms... Moved.

335
00:50:15.799 --> 00:50:17.008
Maybe?

336
00:50:22.931 --> 00:50:28.102
Maybe... Maybe we didn't come back.
We've gotta go on to get out!


337
00:50:28.144 --> 00:50:29.646
Gimme a break!

338
00:50:35.485 --> 00:50:38.822
Everyone... What should we do?

339
00:50:39.614 --> 00:50:40.615
Go on?

340
00:50:42.951 --> 00:50:44.035
Let's go.

341
00:50:45.203 --> 00:50:48.247
We can get out!
Probably...


342
00:50:48.582 --> 00:50:49.666
Right?

343
00:52:01.946 --> 00:52:03.532
Ide...

344
00:52:04.574 --> 00:52:08.452
There's a reason you're in a hurry?

345
00:52:18.588 --> 00:52:20.298
Someone's waiting?

346
00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:23.467
Your wife?

347
00:52:26.971 --> 00:52:28.472
Might be too late.

348
00:52:29.348 --> 00:52:30.850
It's my fault.

349
00:52:32.852 --> 00:52:35.021
But I'll get out of here.

350
00:52:35.396 --> 00:52:37.148
Alone if I have to.

351
00:52:38.775 --> 00:52:41.903
Alright! Haul him up!

352
00:53:35.123 --> 00:53:36.457
You've got...

353
00:53:38.251 --> 00:53:39.669
reasons too.

354
00:54:02.859 --> 00:54:05.028
Um, your button again...

355
00:54:08.907 --> 00:54:10.992
Oh, my button.

356
00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.687
There's a prime!

357
00:54:58.456 --> 00:54:59.916
Hiroto!

358
00:55:51.009 --> 00:55:52.844
Quickly! Here!

359
00:56:02.228 --> 00:56:03.312
Goto!

360
00:56:09.068 --> 00:56:10.153
Ide!

361
00:56:23.792 --> 00:56:26.044
Ide!

362
00:57:40.534 --> 00:57:41.911
Stop it...

363
00:57:56.675 --> 00:57:58.594
He's lost his mind.

364
00:58:25.371 --> 00:58:26.872
So that's it...

365
00:58:55.693 --> 00:58:57.486
Cartesian coordinates.

366
00:58:58.279 --> 00:58:59.948
Cartesian coordinates?

367
00:59:00.656 --> 00:59:04.577
Hey. I told you to stop that nonsense.

368
00:59:14.253 --> 00:59:18.632
This room is x=9, y=23, z=11.

369
00:59:18.882 --> 00:59:24.013
That one is x=10, y=23, z=11.

370
00:59:26.182 --> 00:59:28.267
x, y, z.

371
00:59:28.559 --> 00:59:30.644
Width, length, height?

372
00:59:30.686 --> 00:59:32.021
Height.

373
00:59:32.896 --> 00:59:38.277
Highest three-digit number is 999.
Highest coordinate is 27.


374
00:59:41.864 --> 00:59:46.995
So, if we go through four
more rooms in the y direction,


375
00:59:47.453 --> 00:59:50.623
if I'm right, we'll reach the edge.

376
00:59:52.291 --> 00:59:56.337
If we get there,
will there be an exit?

377
01:00:00.008 --> 01:00:01.425
I don't know.

378
01:00:02.343 --> 01:00:04.428
We'll only know if we go.

379
01:00:09.225 --> 01:00:11.560
Ide wouldn't have hesitated.

380
01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:27.285
I think... I'll keep going too.

381
01:00:44.135 --> 01:00:48.556
x=9, y=24, z=11.

382
01:00:55.688 --> 01:01:00.318
y is 24,
so three more rooms till the edge...


383
01:01:53.537 --> 01:01:55.873
I can't do this anymore.

384
01:01:59.835 --> 01:02:04.423
"We can get out, maybe." And so on.

385
01:02:05.591 --> 01:02:09.428
"We could die, maybe." And so on.

386
01:02:13.098 --> 01:02:15.768
I don't want to think anymore.

387
01:02:51.595 --> 01:02:52.846
Ando!

388
01:03:00.938 --> 01:03:03.106
Guess I'm not so young.

389
01:03:04.692 --> 01:03:05.943
Hey.

390
01:03:08.862 --> 01:03:10.364
Could this be

391
01:03:11.073 --> 01:03:15.578
some kind of... punishment?

392
01:03:19.248 --> 01:03:20.583
Punishment?

393
01:03:23.752 --> 01:03:25.379
I'm sick of it!

394
01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:28.216
How dare they...

395
01:03:28.882 --> 01:03:32.678
Hey, I'm home. Yuichi. Hiroto!

396
01:04:00.163 --> 01:04:02.750
Hey. Hey.

397
01:04:03.334 --> 01:04:04.585
You okay?

398
01:04:04.627 --> 01:04:07.380
You okay? Hey, you okay?

399
01:04:13.927 --> 01:04:15.263
I'm...

400
01:04:22.185 --> 01:04:26.357
I'm... an irredeemable sinner.

401
01:04:31.028 --> 01:04:34.532
I've deceived people. 
Betrayed them.

402
01:04:34.782 --> 01:04:37.993
I've pulled every
dirty trick in the book.


403
01:04:40.413 --> 01:04:42.331
I deserve punishment.

404
01:04:45.626 --> 01:04:49.004
I'm well aware I'm not a good person.

405
01:04:49.963 --> 01:04:54.385
Nevertheless, that's who I am, and...

406
01:04:56.845 --> 01:04:58.431
I'm proud of it.

407
01:05:12.361 --> 01:05:14.279
Ando! Ochi!

408
01:05:36.802 --> 01:05:37.970
Ando?

409
01:05:49.022 --> 01:05:51.024
Let's split up here.

410
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:56.739
I should've done this earlier.

411
01:06:00.743 --> 01:06:03.621
Why? What for?!

412
01:06:13.756 --> 01:06:16.216
I can't bear this any longer.

413
01:06:19.387 --> 01:06:23.348
Know what I despise?
Young people like you.


414
01:06:36.529 --> 01:06:38.196
Ochi! Stop Ando!

415
01:06:41.617 --> 01:06:42.951
Ochi!

416
01:07:19.947 --> 01:07:21.364
It's okay.

417
01:07:22.282 --> 01:07:23.867
I'll go with him.

418
01:08:07.703 --> 01:08:12.249
Let's just... keep heading for the edge.

419
01:10:37.728 --> 01:10:39.021
What the...

420
01:10:39.521 --> 01:10:41.023
What is this?

421
01:11:03.295 --> 01:11:04.755
Yuichi...

422
01:11:07.632 --> 01:11:08.967
Hiroto...

423
01:11:10.678 --> 01:11:11.887
Stay away!

424
01:11:15.057 --> 01:11:16.391
Hiroto.

425
01:11:17.475 --> 01:11:19.019
That's dangerous.

426
01:11:19.978 --> 01:11:21.897
You'll die out there.

427
01:11:22.815 --> 01:11:24.399
I'm tired.

428
01:11:26.526 --> 01:11:27.986
Don't be such a wuss.

429
01:11:30.155 --> 01:11:31.364
Come on.

430
01:11:36.661 --> 01:11:37.913
No...

431
01:11:38.747 --> 01:11:41.917
No matter what I do, 
I'm suffocating.

432
01:11:43.210 --> 01:11:44.461
Tough it out!

433
01:11:46.463 --> 01:11:48.924
Just do what Dad tells you.

434
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:54.262
I toughed it out.

435
01:11:56.807 --> 01:11:58.225
So why?

436
01:12:00.393 --> 01:12:02.145
Why can't you?

437
01:12:10.153 --> 01:12:12.655
Please, not you too...

438
01:12:21.581 --> 01:12:23.041
Yuichi...

439
01:12:24.793 --> 01:12:27.129
You toughed it out, persevered...

440
01:12:29.672 --> 01:12:31.216
Was it worth it?

441
01:12:35.303 --> 01:12:37.180
Doesn't seem so to me.

442
01:12:43.645 --> 01:12:45.981
I didn't... mean to...

443
01:12:51.945 --> 01:12:53.696
I didn't!

444
01:12:58.368 --> 01:12:59.452
This is...

445
01:13:00.162 --> 01:13:01.246
No...

446
01:13:01.789 --> 01:13:02.873
The only...

447
01:13:06.043 --> 01:13:07.502
choice I have.

448
01:13:07.585 --> 01:13:08.753
No!

449
01:13:10.505 --> 01:13:11.464
Don't...

450
01:13:12.424 --> 01:13:13.466
Don't!

451
01:14:20.492 --> 01:14:23.578
There's... nothing we can do.

452
01:14:24.746 --> 01:14:26.373
To get out alive.

453
01:14:28.166 --> 01:14:29.501
Bullshit.

454
01:14:29.751 --> 01:14:33.005
I've got a job, and a family too.

455
01:14:33.546 --> 01:14:37.800
I'm not an irresponsible
little brat like you.


456
01:14:45.893 --> 01:14:47.477
It's true.

457
01:14:49.479 --> 01:14:52.065
I'm still young.

458
01:14:53.984 --> 01:14:55.443
And Ando...

459
01:14:58.530 --> 01:15:00.698
You're an old bastard.

460
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:08.873
Hey.

461
01:15:10.208 --> 01:15:11.960
Watch your mouth.

462
01:15:16.089 --> 01:15:20.010
I'm not one of your staff.

463
01:15:20.969 --> 01:15:26.391
This isn't your company.
Seniority isn't superior.


464
01:15:29.852 --> 01:15:34.316
That's what I... hate the most.

465
01:15:35.442 --> 01:15:38.861
Know-it-alls who actually know nothing.

466
01:15:40.447 --> 01:15:43.033
Adults like you.

467
01:15:51.708 --> 01:15:56.046
You know what I hate the most?

468
01:15:57.130 --> 01:16:03.928
Little shits who blame the world
for everything and never grow up.


469
01:16:08.225 --> 01:16:09.809
That sound again...

470
01:16:11.103 --> 01:16:12.395
From where?

471
01:16:14.939 --> 01:16:16.191
Below?

472
01:16:26.994 --> 01:16:28.078
What the hell?!

473
01:16:31.414 --> 01:16:34.042
Corrupt adults like you...

474
01:16:37.295 --> 01:16:40.340
rob people like me of our freedom.

475
01:16:52.185 --> 01:16:53.103
Get off me!

476
01:18:11.764 --> 01:18:13.350
Hiroto...

477
01:18:14.892 --> 01:18:16.228
Who was he?

478
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:24.611
Your brother?

479
01:18:34.704 --> 01:18:39.792
You tried to save him,
and held out your hand


480
01:18:40.627 --> 01:18:42.379
then pulled it back.

481
01:18:46.883 --> 01:18:48.260
Why?

482
01:18:51.888 --> 01:18:53.140
Why?

483
01:18:59.771 --> 01:19:01.481
Can't you say?

484
01:19:05.568 --> 01:19:07.487
You can't say why?

485
01:19:12.575 --> 01:19:14.076
That's not fair.

486
01:19:16.413 --> 01:19:18.498
Grown-ups are so unfair!

487
01:19:22.585 --> 01:19:24.003
I know...

488
01:19:25.004 --> 01:19:26.673
why Hiroto...

489
01:19:27.799 --> 01:19:30.385
why your brother died!

490
01:19:32.262 --> 01:19:33.846
I understand!

491
01:19:41.563 --> 01:19:42.897
I understand!

492
01:20:29.819 --> 01:20:31.070
Chiharu!

493
01:22:15.342 --> 01:22:17.927
Beyond 26 is...

494
01:22:47.039 --> 01:22:48.500
Wind...

495
01:22:49.917 --> 01:22:51.293
The outside.

496
01:22:52.754 --> 01:22:54.589
The edge of a building?

497
01:23:00.344 --> 01:23:04.015
27 is just empty space...

498
01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:22.575
3 seconds and a bit.

499
01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:23.785
Height is...

500
01:23:31.709 --> 01:23:34.712
Around 53 meters.

501
01:23:34.879 --> 01:23:36.756
You calculated that?

502
01:23:37.549 --> 01:23:40.134
Way too high to jump down...

503
01:23:42.429 --> 01:23:43.555
Here.

504
01:23:44.639 --> 01:23:45.557
What?

505
01:23:45.598 --> 01:23:47.099
Take it.

506
01:23:50.770 --> 01:23:52.354
You got some.

507
01:24:00.362 --> 01:24:02.449
Oh, look.

508
01:24:03.491 --> 01:24:05.743
A room? It's moving!

509
01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.630
It looked like a hole
opened in that wall...


510
01:24:18.297 --> 01:24:19.716
An exit?

511
01:24:22.677 --> 01:24:24.804
Hey! Another one!

512
01:24:26.222 --> 01:24:27.557
It's moving!

513
01:24:30.309 --> 01:24:35.147
Rooms that move probably
return to their original coordinates.


514
01:24:37.191 --> 01:24:40.820
Then,
the coordinates of that hole are...


515
01:24:41.571 --> 01:24:44.574
Y would be 27. Number 999.

516
01:24:45.366 --> 01:24:50.412
We didn't see a 999 in any
of the rooms we went through.


517
01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:55.001
999?

518
01:24:58.129 --> 01:25:00.297
999

519
01:25:00.673 --> 01:25:04.093
It was in a room I saw earlier.

520
01:25:06.262 --> 01:25:10.016
Of the three numbers,
it was in the middle.


521
01:25:13.435 --> 01:25:15.354
Y coordinate 27!

522
01:25:16.898 --> 01:25:18.608
Do rooms that move

523
01:25:18.816 --> 01:25:21.861
go back to that hole like an exit?

524
01:25:38.044 --> 01:25:41.631
I don't know if the
room's moving or not,


525
01:25:42.339 --> 01:25:46.093
but if we're lucky,
it'll be where it was.


526
01:25:56.938 --> 01:25:58.105
Ochi!

527
01:26:00.775 --> 01:26:03.194
No way! No way!

528
01:26:03.235 --> 01:26:04.320
Ochi!

529
01:26:04.361 --> 01:26:05.738
We meet again!

530
01:26:10.785 --> 01:26:13.120
It's so good to see you...

531
01:26:14.997 --> 01:26:17.458
Somehow, we're still alive!

532
01:26:20.544 --> 01:26:23.464
Blood? Are you alright?

533
01:26:30.722 --> 01:26:35.810
Ando... isn't with you?

534
01:26:38.479 --> 01:26:40.397
He got caught...

535
01:26:42.650 --> 01:26:44.360
in a trap...

536
01:26:45.737 --> 01:26:47.321
Ando...

537
01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:55.037
I'm truly... sorry.

538
01:27:22.857 --> 01:27:26.443
The "Y coordinate 27 room"?

539
01:27:26.527 --> 01:27:30.614
Putting that simply,
we might be able to get out?


540
01:27:34.410 --> 01:27:36.495
No prime. Let's go!

541
01:27:38.706 --> 01:27:40.624
Come on. Hurry.

542
01:27:41.458 --> 01:27:43.544
You too, Kai. Hurry.

543
01:27:56.724 --> 01:27:57.892
Here.

544
01:28:03.856 --> 01:28:08.527
Ando... What really happened to him?

545
01:28:15.534 --> 01:28:18.955
He died... in a trap.

546
01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:29.506
If the room hasn't moved,
it must be this one.


547
01:28:34.804 --> 01:28:37.014
What? Want to talk?

548
01:28:45.898 --> 01:28:48.067
He's... lying.

549
01:28:48.609 --> 01:28:50.277
Lying? Ochi?

550
01:28:55.867 --> 01:28:57.493
Ando...

551
01:28:59.245 --> 01:29:02.623
I think... Ochi...

552
01:29:05.584 --> 01:29:07.336
killed him.

553
01:29:10.672 --> 01:29:11.841
It's here.

554
01:29:12.674 --> 01:29:15.636
999. I'll go and check it.

555
01:29:23.936 --> 01:29:25.687
Why think that?

556
01:29:28.065 --> 01:29:33.154
When he said... Ando died...

557
01:29:36.157 --> 01:29:37.491
he was smiling.

558
01:29:38.868 --> 01:29:40.452
That's odd.

559
01:29:41.453 --> 01:29:44.706
Nothing. Why?

560
01:29:52.048 --> 01:29:56.635
Even though... there was a prime number.

561
01:30:21.368 --> 01:30:23.287
Did you kill him?

562
01:30:26.707 --> 01:30:28.542
You killed Ando?

563
01:30:33.172 --> 01:30:34.340
Maybe I did.

564
01:30:38.677 --> 01:30:40.012
Why?

565
01:30:41.763 --> 01:30:43.432
Why do that?!

566
01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:48.729
Why did I kill him...?
Sorry! Sorry, wait a second...


567
01:30:51.398 --> 01:30:56.320
I remember.
He said the world's not to blame, I am.


568
01:30:56.946 --> 01:30:59.115
It's the other way around.

569
01:31:01.617 --> 01:31:03.702
I'm toughing it out.

570
01:31:04.871 --> 01:31:08.624
I've worked so many
jobs I didn't want to do...


571
01:31:10.376 --> 01:31:11.835
So much stress...

572
01:31:14.713 --> 01:31:16.798
At the convenience store...

573
01:31:18.175 --> 01:31:20.677
The old man who runs it...

574
01:31:22.013 --> 01:31:27.851
Those teenagers that come...
They're all assholes... Dammit...


575
01:31:29.979 --> 01:31:34.066
And... they bully me.

576
01:31:34.816 --> 01:31:37.319
You know, Chiharu.

577
01:31:40.697 --> 01:31:42.909
We're toughing it out!

578
01:31:44.994 --> 01:31:47.329
But people get mad at us...

579
01:31:49.706 --> 01:31:52.501
No matter where I go...

580
01:31:54.962 --> 01:31:58.299
I don't have

581
01:32:00.259 --> 01:32:03.220
any other choice!

582
01:32:06.265 --> 01:32:07.683
What more

583
01:32:09.101 --> 01:32:10.602
can I do?

584
01:32:16.650 --> 01:32:18.569
I don't want to live...

585
01:32:20.612 --> 01:32:22.364
I want to die...

586
01:32:25.451 --> 01:32:27.286
I want to die?

587
01:32:30.247 --> 01:32:32.749
If I'm gonna die anyway

588
01:32:34.335 --> 01:32:35.419
why not kill?!

589
01:32:44.303 --> 01:32:48.474
That... sounds fair to me.

590
01:32:51.227 --> 01:32:53.229
How about you, Goto?

591
01:32:54.813 --> 01:32:56.482
That's no reason...

592
01:32:57.524 --> 01:32:59.693
That's no reason to kill!

593
01:33:06.658 --> 01:33:08.660
Hypocrite alert.

594
01:33:10.579 --> 01:33:12.498
You say that,

595
01:33:13.749 --> 01:33:17.419
but it seems like
you've killed before too.


596
01:33:45.531 --> 01:33:50.036
Kids oughta... stay out of adults' way!

597
01:33:54.415 --> 01:33:55.624
Chiharu.

598
01:33:57.084 --> 01:33:58.669
Chiharu!

599
01:34:01.588 --> 01:34:04.091
Adults will let you down...

600
01:34:06.177 --> 01:34:07.719
and cheat.

601
01:34:17.104 --> 01:34:18.355
Stop this...

602
01:34:21.650 --> 01:34:22.984
Should I?

603
01:34:25.946 --> 01:34:27.323
Ah, why not?

604
01:34:39.751 --> 01:34:42.171
Goto... Goto!

605
01:34:46.300 --> 01:34:47.634
Goto!

606
01:34:49.595 --> 01:34:51.347
In this world

607
01:34:52.931 --> 01:34:55.016
there's only despair.

608
01:34:56.727 --> 01:34:58.312
People like us...

609
01:34:59.730 --> 01:35:02.816
Death is the only choice we have.

610
01:35:05.986 --> 01:35:11.533
Even if we get out,
nothing good's waiting for us!


611
01:35:22.586 --> 01:35:24.171
People like us

612
01:35:25.464 --> 01:35:27.216
have got nobody

613
01:35:28.175 --> 01:35:31.512
and nothing to believe in!

614
01:35:34.473 --> 01:35:36.057
I believe!

615
01:35:42.939 --> 01:35:44.275
I...

616
01:35:45.401 --> 01:35:46.985
have Goto.

617
01:35:48.111 --> 01:35:49.946
I believe in Goto!

618
01:35:50.406 --> 01:35:51.657
Yuichi!

619
01:36:07.673 --> 01:36:09.132
Why?!

620
01:36:12.344 --> 01:36:14.305
Why?!

621
01:36:31.697 --> 01:36:33.199
You're back.

622
01:36:50.632 --> 01:36:53.009
There's no time! Hurry!

623
01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.598
Chiharu!

624
01:37:00.309 --> 01:37:01.893
You two, hurry!

625
01:37:12.488 --> 01:37:13.530
Goto!

626
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:16.575
Chiharu, let go.

627
01:37:16.617 --> 01:37:17.534
It's okay!

628
01:37:17.576 --> 01:37:19.411
No! No!

629
01:37:20.078 --> 01:37:21.580
Go!

630
01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:12.774
The exit...

631
01:39:18.321 --> 01:39:22.283
Out there, is that... the exit?

632
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:34.254
Even if you get out,
maybe nothing will change.


633
01:39:36.548 --> 01:39:38.384
Will you go anyway?

634
01:40:05.577 --> 01:40:07.078
I'm the one...

635
01:40:09.706 --> 01:40:11.458
who has to change.

636
01:41:02.175 --> 01:41:03.510
Bye bye.

637
01:44:51.154 --> 01:44:52.613
Hello.

638
01:44:54.449 --> 01:44:56.367
So who...

639
01:44:58.411 --> 01:45:00.330
are you people?
