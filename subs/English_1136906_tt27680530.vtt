3
00:00:20.536 --> 00:00:21.848
We are
hurdling toward the day


4
00:00:21.848 --> 00:00:24.023
when climate change
could be irreversible.


5
00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.025
Rising sea
levels already altering


6
00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:26.991
this nation's coast.

7
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:28.924
China's
capital is choking


8
00:00:28.924 --> 00:00:30.615
in its worst
pollution of the year.


9
00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:32.824
5% of
species will become extinct.


10
00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.724
Sea levels
rising, glaciers melting.


11
00:00:36.345 --> 00:00:39.245
If we do nothing,
the picture of the world


12
00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:41.833
is one of absolute devastation.

13
00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:44.112
There's no convincing
scientific evidence


14
00:00:44.112 --> 00:00:46.459
for man-made
climate change.


15
00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:50.808
We're spewing 162
million tons of human-cause,


16
00:00:50.808 --> 00:00:54.156
global warming pollution
into it every single day,


17
00:00:54.156 --> 00:00:57.746
as if this is an open sewer.

18
00:00:57.746 --> 00:00:59.506
Satellite data demonstrates

19
00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:02.682
in the last 17 years,
there's been zero warming,


20
00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:03.890
none whatsoever.

21
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.409
It's why, you
remember how it used


22
00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.343
to be called global warming
and then magically the theory


23
00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:09.447
changed to climate change.

24
00:01:09.447 --> 00:01:10.310
Sure.

25
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.518
The reason is
it wasn't warming,


26
00:01:11.518 --> 00:01:13.313
but the computer
models still say it is,


27
00:01:13.313 --> 00:01:15.281
except the satellites
show it's not.


28
00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:18.905
We are in the beginning
of a mass extinction


29
00:01:18.905 --> 00:01:21.252
and all you can
talk about is money


30
00:01:21.252 --> 00:01:26.257
and fairy tales of eternal
economic growth, how dare you.


31
00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:29.812
Drill baby, drill?

32
00:01:31.193 --> 00:01:32.643
Drill baby drill.

33
00:01:34.162 --> 00:01:35.715
You can have the
best capitalism


34
00:01:35.715 --> 00:01:37.475
and global capitalism
in the world,


35
00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:39.995
but if people are dead,
they're dead, it's over.


36
00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.654
Enough is enough.

37
00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:46.139
The world is at
a breaking point.


38
00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:50.799
Catastrophic climate
change, biosphere collapse,


39
00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.079
and a global energy crisis
have been met with apathy,


40
00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.701
denial and despair.

41
00:01:56.701 --> 00:01:59.290
It is going to take
everything we know and love.


42
00:02:00.774 --> 00:02:03.122
Like clockwork,
our corporate overlords


43
00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:06.401
present us with two
untenable options.


44
00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:10.025
Submit to an itinerary
of energy rationing


45
00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:12.407
and population control,

46
00:02:12.407 --> 00:02:15.272
or ride the status
quo into the abyss.


47
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.931
Both sides are right and
both sides are wrong,


48
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.832
which means both sides are
missing a critical piece


49
00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:24.695
of the puzzle.

50
00:02:25.903 --> 00:02:28.733
Since the early

51
00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:32.323
an increasing number of
unauthorized and or unidentified


52
00:02:32.323 --> 00:02:35.637
aircraft or objects in military
controlled training areas


53
00:02:35.637 --> 00:02:38.812
and training ranges and
other designated airspace.


54
00:02:38.812 --> 00:02:40.952
Some of them appeared
to remain stationary


55
00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.161
in winds aloft,

56
00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:44.335
move against the wind,
maneuver abruptly,


57
00:02:44.335 --> 00:02:45.612
or move at considerable speed

58
00:02:45.612 --> 00:02:47.614
without discernible
means of propulsion.


59
00:02:49.685 --> 00:02:51.066
That's pretty intriguing.

60
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.966
I think I would, without
discernible means of propulsion,


61
00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:58.038
I would say that we're
not aware of any adversary


62
00:02:58.038 --> 00:02:59.316
that can move an object

63
00:02:59.316 --> 00:03:01.249
without discernible
means of propulsion.


64
00:03:03.113 --> 00:03:06.323
The phrase
unidentified flying object,


65
00:03:06.323 --> 00:03:09.774
is a deliberately
obfuscating term.


66
00:03:09.774 --> 00:03:12.915
What it really is is
an alternative energy


67
00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:14.745
and propulsion device.

68
00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:17.575
This is the real
reason for the secrecy.


69
00:03:17.575 --> 00:03:20.785
These technologies, if
they were disclosed,


70
00:03:20.785 --> 00:03:24.789
would end fossil fuels,
pollution and poverty overnight


71
00:03:25.756 --> 00:03:30.899
and usher in a new era of
abundance, freedom and peace.


72
00:03:31.796 --> 00:03:35.662
Instead, they have been kept
secret for over 100 years.


73
00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:39.356
Dr. Steven Greer, the
world's leading expert


74
00:03:39.356 --> 00:03:42.842
on UFOs and extraterrestrial intelligence,

75
00:03:42.842 --> 00:03:45.741
has been advising presidents
and heads of state


76
00:03:45.741 --> 00:03:48.986
for 30 years on the
urgency of the situation.


77
00:03:50.574 --> 00:03:52.817
We don't have much time left.

78
00:03:58.064 --> 00:04:00.929
What is this lost century?

79
00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:04.967
This lost century is
literally 100 years,


80
00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:06.935
more than that now,

81
00:04:06.935 --> 00:04:11.595
of technologies that have
existed that have vanished.


82
00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:12.975
I mean, I was just recently

83
00:04:12.975 --> 00:04:14.391
in a meeting in
Washington with the people


84
00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:16.910
who managed the black
budget of the United States.


85
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.534
They have no access
to this material


86
00:04:19.534 --> 00:04:23.365
because between the
late 1800s and now,


87
00:04:23.365 --> 00:04:26.299
the ingenious
inventions in sciences


88
00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:30.372
that could have moved us off
that extinction-level path


89
00:04:30.372 --> 00:04:31.649
that we're on,

90
00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:34.928
have all been ruthlessly
suppressed, confiscated.


91
00:04:34.928 --> 00:04:36.792
And the only way
that's gonna change,


92
00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:38.760
it is not gonna
change in Washington.


93
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.934
It is not gonna change
in a large corporation.


94
00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:42.177
Unlikely.

95
00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:44.524
It's gonna change by
us, the people doing it.


96
00:04:44.524 --> 00:04:45.387
So it's about us.

97
00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.154
Let's look at this,
you know what this is?


98
00:05:00.057 --> 00:05:01.265
There's
a whole fleet of them,


99
00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:03.267
look on the ASA.

100
00:05:03.267 --> 00:05:04.958
My gosh.

101
00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:07.444
They're all
going against the wind.


102
00:05:07.444 --> 00:05:09.825
The wind's a 120 knots west.

103
00:05:09.825 --> 00:05:12.242
Look at that thing, dude.

104
00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:16.453
This is an alternative
energy and propulsion device.


105
00:05:16.453 --> 00:05:19.318
These are things
that have existed


106
00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:21.734
all the way back into the '60s,

107
00:05:21.734 --> 00:05:24.115
but the one that
they call the Tic Tac


108
00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:26.739
here off the coast of San Diego,

109
00:05:26.739 --> 00:05:29.224
the white one, looked
very much like this.


110
00:05:29.224 --> 00:05:31.709
These have been made by
the Lockheed Skunk Works


111
00:05:32.986 --> 00:05:35.195
and my favorite
letter of all time,


112
00:05:35.195 --> 00:05:38.268
the head of the Lockheed
Skunk Works, Ben Rich.


113
00:05:38.268 --> 00:05:41.926
Look at the date on it, 1986.

114
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.033
This was an answer to a
letter someone wrote and says,


115
00:05:45.033 --> 00:05:48.070
are these UFOs man-made
or extraterrestrial?


116
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.420
He says, many of
our man-made UFOs


117
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.353
are really unfunded opportunities,

118
00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.286
meaning if it was
released for public use,


119
00:05:56.286 --> 00:05:57.908
it'd be an enormous industry.

120
00:05:57.908 --> 00:05:59.496
Every meeting I go in
Washington, I said,


121
00:05:59.496 --> 00:06:01.774
see that thing you guys
are all talking about?


122
00:06:02.947 --> 00:06:04.604
That's Lockheed Skunk Works.

123
00:06:04.604 --> 00:06:07.711
They have left us behind
and everything we see


124
00:06:07.711 --> 00:06:12.509
out in our world today is
absolutely a construct.


125
00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:14.511
It's an absolute construct.

126
00:06:14.511 --> 00:06:17.755
The internal combustion
engines are obsolete.


127
00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:20.068
The nuclear power
plants are obsolete.


128
00:06:20.068 --> 00:06:22.312
The coal fire
plants are obsolete.


129
00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:25.107
We have the wind generators,
those are obsolete.


130
00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:27.247
The solar power,
it's all obsolete.


131
00:06:27.247 --> 00:06:31.735
If we could follow the gravity
research that the contractors


132
00:06:31.735 --> 00:06:34.324
and research institutions
have been doing,


133
00:06:34.324 --> 00:06:36.326
we could see that
bright future as well.


134
00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:41.848
So a lot of people say,
well, how is this thing moving?


135
00:06:41.848 --> 00:06:45.300
There's no fuel on board,
there's no nuclear power plant,


136
00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:47.958
there's no jets and no rockets.

137
00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:49.822
Well, way back in the '40s,

138
00:06:49.822 --> 00:06:51.824
Dr. Casimir, he
predicted and later


139
00:06:51.824 --> 00:06:53.722
it was proven in the '50s,

140
00:06:53.722 --> 00:06:55.862
what's called the zero
point energy field.


141
00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:00.902
Zero point
energy or what Nikola Tesla


142
00:07:00.902 --> 00:07:02.904
called radiant energy

143
00:07:02.904 --> 00:07:06.010
is the most profound
and transformative gift


144
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.219
that the quantum
world offers us.


145
00:07:09.048 --> 00:07:11.602
The seemingly empty
vacuum of space


146
00:07:11.602 --> 00:07:15.399
is actually a roiling
sea of virtual particles


147
00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:18.126
fluctuating in and
out of existence


148
00:07:18.126 --> 00:07:20.991
and all those fluctuations
require energy.


149
00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:24.684
If we could tap into
this energy source,


150
00:07:24.684 --> 00:07:28.101
we would unlock a virtually
unlimited reservoir


151
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:31.001
of clean, free energy.

152
00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:33.348
Extraterrestrial spacecraft

153
00:07:33.348 --> 00:07:36.455
are known to harness
zero point energy.


154
00:07:37.801 --> 00:07:40.804
US scientists
understand what this was.


155
00:07:40.804 --> 00:07:44.428
It was an energy device that
used a zero point energy.


156
00:07:44.428 --> 00:07:45.947
It didn't mean that's
what they referred it to


157
00:07:45.947 --> 00:07:47.224
as zero point energy.

158
00:07:47.224 --> 00:07:50.020
And it was connected
in such a manner


159
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.678
that this device could power,

160
00:07:52.678 --> 00:07:57.096
I mean from very small a
flashlight or a very small watch


161
00:07:57.096 --> 00:08:00.099
up to a city and
power was determined


162
00:08:00.099 --> 00:08:02.412
by what the demand on it was.

163
00:08:03.723 --> 00:08:05.587
The
implications of free energy


164
00:08:05.587 --> 00:08:08.521
go far beyond bringing
monthly electric bills


165
00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:12.180
to zero or running a
car without gasoline.


166
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:14.665
Most of the cost
of making anything,


167
00:08:14.665 --> 00:08:17.737
from growing food to
building a skyscraper,


168
00:08:17.737 --> 00:08:20.395
is the energy of
pulling raw materials


169
00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:22.984
out of the ground,
shipping, processing,


170
00:08:22.984 --> 00:08:25.193
shipping again and so on.

171
00:08:26.574 --> 00:08:29.439
If the cost of
energy goes to zero,


172
00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:32.062
the cost of agriculture
and manufacturing


173
00:08:32.062 --> 00:08:33.443
becomes negligible.

174
00:08:34.927 --> 00:08:38.275
Other critical solutions
like water desalinization


175
00:08:38.275 --> 00:08:41.209
to end drought or
air purification,


176
00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:43.798
both of which are
prohibitively expensive


177
00:08:43.798 --> 00:08:47.146
due to energy costs, would
suddenly become viable


178
00:08:47.146 --> 00:08:48.768
in a free energy paradigm.

179
00:08:50.045 --> 00:08:53.324
A new world where humans
live in perfect harmony


180
00:08:53.324 --> 00:08:56.776
with nature is possible
within our lifetimes.


181
00:08:56.776 --> 00:09:00.124
But this would mean
the end of oil, gas,


182
00:09:00.124 --> 00:09:03.473
and coal, as well as the
centralized power grid


183
00:09:03.473 --> 00:09:06.337
and the global
macroeconomic system


184
00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:08.788
which will stop at
nothing to protect


185
00:09:08.788 --> 00:09:11.308
the hundreds of trillions
of dollars at stake.


186
00:09:14.104 --> 00:09:16.865
The consequences
of keeping all this secret,


187
00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:18.591
we are in the process right now

188
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:21.525
of doing something that
I've termed Planetocide,


189
00:09:21.525 --> 00:09:24.528
the deliberate killing
of an entire planet


190
00:09:24.528 --> 00:09:26.254
with malice of forethought,

191
00:09:26.254 --> 00:09:29.878
through greed and
stupidity and power.


192
00:09:29.878 --> 00:09:32.191
All the damage we're gonna
see in a few minutes,


193
00:09:32.191 --> 00:09:36.989
totally avoidable, every bit
of it since the 1920s at least.


194
00:09:36.989 --> 00:09:39.474
And we can prove this.

195
00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:44.341
I'm afraid that the term
Planetocide is all too real,


196
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:47.482
but Ecocide doesn't
really say it.


197
00:09:47.482 --> 00:09:51.935
We are in the process of
destroying the biosphere,


198
00:09:51.935 --> 00:09:56.802
destroying a habitable world
for certainly the majority


199
00:09:56.802 --> 00:09:58.389
of the animals on the planet.

200
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:59.598
I'm an older guy,

201
00:09:59.598 --> 00:10:01.910
I won't be around to
see the worst of this,


202
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.913
but I have not just
trepidation but terror


203
00:10:04.913 --> 00:10:08.883
at what's gonna be faced
by my son's generation


204
00:10:08.883 --> 00:10:11.541
and the generations
that come after him.


205
00:10:12.783 --> 00:10:15.890
When someone asks me
how bad is the crisis,


206
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.168
I kind of don't
know where to begin


207
00:10:18.168 --> 00:10:19.687
because what does
that even mean?


208
00:10:19.687 --> 00:10:22.621
Does it mean, what is
the threat to humanity?


209
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:25.796
Have we reached some
kind of tipping point,


210
00:10:25.796 --> 00:10:27.349
certain things

211
00:10:27.349 --> 00:10:31.422
that get under my skin or
that especially alarm me,


212
00:10:31.422 --> 00:10:36.117
and one of them is
the insect holocaust,


213
00:10:36.117 --> 00:10:37.670
for lack of a better word.

214
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:41.985
The precipitous decline
in the number of insects,


215
00:10:41.985 --> 00:10:45.298
the number of species,
total biomass of insects.


216
00:10:45.298 --> 00:10:48.888
A lot of studies put
that decline at 80%.


217
00:10:48.888 --> 00:10:50.200
When I was a child,

218
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.134
when we went on a long drive,
especially in the summer,


219
00:10:53.134 --> 00:10:54.791
like we'd have to have
the windshield wipers on


220
00:10:54.791 --> 00:10:58.449
from time to time to clear
off the bug splatter.


221
00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:00.313
Like you just don't
have that anymore.


222
00:11:00.313 --> 00:11:02.039
Insects are like the foundation

223
00:11:02.039 --> 00:11:04.352
of the terrestrial food chain.

224
00:11:04.352 --> 00:11:06.975
Like you can't have
a thriving ecosystem


225
00:11:06.975 --> 00:11:10.289
without thriving insects.

226
00:11:10.289 --> 00:11:12.602
This is the sixth
great extinction


227
00:11:12.602 --> 00:11:13.775
that's happening on the planet

228
00:11:13.775 --> 00:11:16.916
and it's 100%
man-made, all of it.


229
00:11:16.916 --> 00:11:19.194
We have to all awaken
'cause what's happened,


230
00:11:19.194 --> 00:11:22.335
I think we're like a
frog being boiled slowly


231
00:11:22.335 --> 00:11:23.440
and suddenly we're gonna wake up

232
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.131
and find out, it's too late.

233
00:11:25.131 --> 00:11:27.686
150 species every
day go extinct.


234
00:11:27.686 --> 00:11:31.103
Now, these aren't all
animals, all kinds of species.


235
00:11:31.103 --> 00:11:36.246
The planet has been dying at
human hands for a long time.


236
00:11:36.246 --> 00:11:38.731
A naturalist, I like
J. B. MacKinnon,


237
00:11:38.731 --> 00:11:42.735
he calls the world a 10%
world as kind of a poetic


238
00:11:42.735 --> 00:11:46.636
expression of how much
life has declined.


239
00:11:46.636 --> 00:11:49.017
So there's maybe

240
00:11:49.017 --> 00:11:50.536
that there were 500 years ago

241
00:11:51.502 --> 00:11:54.402
and the seabirds
and the wetlands


242
00:11:54.402 --> 00:11:58.337
and the mangrove swamps
and the fish biomass,


243
00:11:58.337 --> 00:12:02.030
we don't even know
what we have lost,


244
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.377
although on some
level we feel it.


245
00:12:04.377 --> 00:12:07.864
This is part of the despair,
part of the alienation


246
00:12:07.864 --> 00:12:10.901
and the anguish that
sensitive people feel.


247
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:13.179
Ice caps are melting.

248
00:12:13.179 --> 00:12:14.802
The oceans are
certainly gonna rise.


249
00:12:14.802 --> 00:12:16.389
They could rise
as much as 20 feet


250
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:19.427
if we have the big ones melt.

251
00:12:19.427 --> 00:12:22.602
This is all the
way back in 1958


252
00:12:22.602 --> 00:12:26.917
and there was a full page
color ad in Life Magazine.


253
00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:29.437
Everybody was reading
Life Magazine at the time,


254
00:12:29.437 --> 00:12:30.818
and it's by an oil company,

255
00:12:30.818 --> 00:12:32.785
which was the
predecessor of Exxon,


256
00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:34.614
which was called Humble.

257
00:12:34.614 --> 00:12:37.238
Each day, Humble
supplies enough energy


258
00:12:37.238 --> 00:12:41.000
to melt seven million
tons of glacier.


259
00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.554
Here they're bragging
about it in 1958.


260
00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:48.283
So this company gets rebranded
as Exxon in the 1970s


261
00:12:48.283 --> 00:12:50.872
and July, 1977,
they have a meeting


262
00:12:50.872 --> 00:12:54.738
inside Exxon headquarters
where their chief scientist,


263
00:12:54.738 --> 00:12:58.086
James Black, is showing
slides that are warning


264
00:12:58.086 --> 00:13:01.227
that burning fossil fuels
are going to eventually


265
00:13:01.227 --> 00:13:05.266
endanger all of humanity,
they know this in 1977.


266
00:13:05.266 --> 00:13:06.819
"Present thinking holds

267
00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:11.272
that man has a time window
of 15 years before the need


268
00:13:11.272 --> 00:13:13.308
for hard decisions
regarding changes


269
00:13:13.308 --> 00:13:17.140
in energy strategies
might become critical."


270
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.558
Well those 15 years were
up in the early 1990s.


271
00:13:21.558 --> 00:13:23.042
Look at this.

272
00:13:23.042 --> 00:13:25.596
How long ago was it recognized
that this was a disaster?


273
00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:29.393
Senior scientist
Exxon, 45 years ago.


274
00:13:29.393 --> 00:13:31.948
And actually it was
known before then.


275
00:13:31.948 --> 00:13:35.641
This is insanity, this
is civilization gone mad.


276
00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:39.127
These companies have really
not been held accountable.


277
00:13:39.127 --> 00:13:41.095
We've lived in a
fossil fuel economy now


278
00:13:41.095 --> 00:13:44.995
for more than 100 years and
it's just been accelerating.


279
00:13:44.995 --> 00:13:47.273
The amount of wealth
has been increasing.


280
00:13:47.273 --> 00:13:49.793
You have situations now
where the head of ExxonMobil


281
00:13:49.793 --> 00:13:52.002
goes on to become the
Secretary of State,


282
00:13:52.002 --> 00:13:54.936
Rex Tillerson under
President Trump.


283
00:13:54.936 --> 00:13:56.489
And I'm an environmentalist,

284
00:13:56.489 --> 00:13:58.077
a lot of people don't
understand that.


285
00:13:58.077 --> 00:14:00.942
I think I know more about the
environment than most people.


286
00:14:00.942 --> 00:14:03.462
And so there is really
very little accountability


287
00:14:03.462 --> 00:14:04.946
that exists.

288
00:14:04.946 --> 00:14:07.880
Many scientists such
as myself have discovered


289
00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:12.022
that there are very
concerted, well-oiled machines


290
00:14:12.022 --> 00:14:13.817
that provide false information,

291
00:14:13.817 --> 00:14:18.166
even to scientific
and academic programs.


292
00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:19.581
It's called Capture,

293
00:14:19.581 --> 00:14:21.687
where they try to
rationalize away


294
00:14:21.687 --> 00:14:24.241
this problem and
everything's fine.


295
00:14:24.241 --> 00:14:25.933
One company, Exxon alone,

296
00:14:25.933 --> 00:14:28.521
has funded more than

297
00:14:28.521 --> 00:14:30.765
to keep alive its campaign

298
00:14:30.765 --> 00:14:33.699
to deny the worst impacts
of climate change.


299
00:14:33.699 --> 00:14:35.114
There was a guy
named Martin Hoffert


300
00:14:35.114 --> 00:14:38.186
and he's a Professor of
Physics at New York University,


301
00:14:38.186 --> 00:14:41.189
a consultant to Exxon for
their climate modeling


302
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:44.606
during the 1980s,
and he said this.


303
00:14:44.606 --> 00:14:47.747
The advertisements that
Exxon ran in major newspapers


304
00:14:47.747 --> 00:14:49.680
raising doubt about
climate change


305
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.304
were contradicted by
the scientific work


306
00:14:52.304 --> 00:14:54.513
we had done and continued to do.

307
00:14:54.513 --> 00:14:58.275
Exxon was publicly promoting
views that its own scientists


308
00:14:58.275 --> 00:15:00.588
were wrong and we knew that

309
00:15:00.588 --> 00:15:03.246
because we were the major
group working on this.


310
00:15:03.246 --> 00:15:06.974
This was immoral and has
greatly set back efforts


311
00:15:06.974 --> 00:15:08.458
to address climate change.

312
00:15:09.666 --> 00:15:11.150
Here's a case where
the Canadian government


313
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.670
ordered the scientist not to
disclose the extent of it.


314
00:15:14.844 --> 00:15:16.431
So what you get in the media

315
00:15:16.431 --> 00:15:20.435
is a very sanitized
version of this problem,


316
00:15:20.435 --> 00:15:21.920
which many people believe

317
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.164
we may have already gone over
the edge of the red line,


318
00:15:25.164 --> 00:15:28.616
how far we can go
without a safe return


319
00:15:28.616 --> 00:15:31.895
to a sustainable civilization.

320
00:15:31.895 --> 00:15:34.656
China is the world's
biggest greenhouse gas emitter


321
00:15:34.656 --> 00:15:37.659
by a huge margin, and if
there's anything clear


322
00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:40.731
so far coming out of this
year's Communist party Congress,


323
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:43.389
it's that coal is having
a bit of a revival


324
00:15:43.389 --> 00:15:45.288
in the world's second
largest economy.


325
00:15:45.288 --> 00:15:49.395
A senior energy officials
said China will give full play


326
00:15:49.395 --> 00:15:53.330
to coal as ballast in
the country's energy mix.


327
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.127
Why are we digging
stuff up out of the ground


328
00:15:57.127 --> 00:16:01.097
when we haven't needed the
burn coal since about the 1920,


329
00:16:01.097 --> 00:16:02.753
1930 time period?

330
00:16:02.753 --> 00:16:03.927
Here's your solar panels.

331
00:16:03.927 --> 00:16:05.653
I had to replace
my solar panels,


332
00:16:05.653 --> 00:16:08.967
and they all end up in a
landfill, they're toxic.


333
00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:11.176
You know, we're
working in a paradigm,


334
00:16:11.176 --> 00:16:13.557
whether it be fossil fuels
or what is being proposed


335
00:16:13.557 --> 00:16:16.733
as new energy, that
isn't gonna work.


336
00:16:16.733 --> 00:16:18.838
I'm certainly not opposed
to renewable technologies,


337
00:16:18.838 --> 00:16:22.221
but you know, they are
dependent on weather,


338
00:16:22.221 --> 00:16:23.705
they're dependent on
how much wind there is


339
00:16:23.705 --> 00:16:26.329
in an area or they're
able to harness of the sun


340
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:31.161
and they cost an awful
lot to bring up to speed.


341
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:33.923
No environmentalists
wants to see vast landscapes


342
00:16:33.923 --> 00:16:38.686
converted to biofuels or
pit mines to mine silver


343
00:16:38.686 --> 00:16:42.552
and cobalt and lithium, wind
turbines that kill birds


344
00:16:42.552 --> 00:16:45.003
and mar the landscape.

345
00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:46.590
This isn't what
we signed up for,


346
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.593
but this is what
happens when we abdicate


347
00:16:49.593 --> 00:16:53.425
our relational care
for every place


348
00:16:53.425 --> 00:16:58.430
and ecosystem and being
on Earth and transfer that


349
00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:07.715
onto yet another quantitative
cost benefit paradigm.


350
00:17:07.715 --> 00:17:09.475
And you have lithium fields,

351
00:17:09.475 --> 00:17:12.892
the amount of pollution from
these lithium mining operations


352
00:17:12.892 --> 00:17:15.102
for lithium ion
batteries in your Tesla.


353
00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:17.276
Not to mention they
catch fire periodically.


354
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.831
Now, fair enough, I'm an
emergency and trauma doctor.


355
00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:23.662
Gasoline cars catch
fire more.


356
00:17:23.662 --> 00:17:26.216
I can tell you some
horror stories,


357
00:17:26.216 --> 00:17:28.253
which I'm sure you
don't want to hear.


358
00:17:28.253 --> 00:17:32.360
And then we have this whole
morass of how we're living,


359
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.053
on wires that we haven't needed.

360
00:17:35.053 --> 00:17:39.954
And so the entire system
is set up to benefit


361
00:17:39.954 --> 00:17:44.096
a relatively small number
of global oligarchs


362
00:17:44.096 --> 00:17:45.822
and financial interests

363
00:17:45.822 --> 00:17:48.790
that we absolutely
have to say enough,


364
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:51.241
they've had 150
years to do this.


365
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:56.074
If we want to live
among other life


366
00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:59.836
in the future and not
in a concrete hellscape


367
00:17:59.836 --> 00:18:02.977
where we retreat
into virtual worlds


368
00:18:02.977 --> 00:18:05.669
to compensate for the
loss of what is alive,


369
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:07.844
then we have to change our ways

370
00:18:07.844 --> 00:18:12.676
and we have to start acting
from our care for life.


371
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.093
Most of you know that

372
00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:17.440
there are these nano
particulate plastics


373
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.581
that are in the entire food
chain that cause cancer,


374
00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:24.274
they disrupt hormones,
they damage your brain.


375
00:18:24.274 --> 00:18:26.345
And why?

376
00:18:26.345 --> 00:18:29.797
Well, if we had quote,
unquote free energy systems


377
00:18:29.797 --> 00:18:30.798
from what we're gonna describe,

378
00:18:30.798 --> 00:18:32.282
this zero point energy field,

379
00:18:33.456 --> 00:18:35.492
you would never have
to have anything wasted


380
00:18:35.492 --> 00:18:37.115
'cause you have 100% recycling.

381
00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:39.669
'Cause the cost of the
energy would be zero.


382
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:41.809
And then we have all
these famines happening


383
00:18:41.809 --> 00:18:44.708
around the world
because of the absolute


384
00:18:44.708 --> 00:18:46.227
social injustice of a system

385
00:18:46.227 --> 00:18:51.474
that is driven by greed
and scarce resources.


386
00:18:51.474 --> 00:18:53.579
When, as Tesla pointed out,

387
00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:56.306
there's an infinite amount
of energy to be tapped


388
00:18:56.306 --> 00:18:58.239
in what is now being quantified

389
00:18:58.239 --> 00:19:00.690
as the zero point energy field.

390
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:01.932
How do you tap it now?

391
00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:03.900
Mainstream science says
it can't be tapped.


392
00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:05.591
It's there theoretically.

393
00:19:05.591 --> 00:19:06.868
Not true.

394
00:19:06.868 --> 00:19:09.664
And you're gonna find
out how untrue that is.


395
00:19:09.664 --> 00:19:11.597
International Panel
on Climate Change,


396
00:19:11.597 --> 00:19:14.497
which issues annual reports
about the dire state


397
00:19:14.497 --> 00:19:15.739
of things that we're facing.

398
00:19:15.739 --> 00:19:17.258
It says in their latest report

399
00:19:17.258 --> 00:19:18.915
that over the next decade alone,

400
00:19:18.915 --> 00:19:21.987
between 32 million and

401
00:19:21.987 --> 00:19:24.403
are gonna be driven into poverty

402
00:19:24.403 --> 00:19:27.303
because of the change in
climate in their countries.


403
00:19:27.303 --> 00:19:31.755
Three billion people, almost
half the world's population,


404
00:19:31.755 --> 00:19:34.206
has no way to cook their food.

405
00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:36.381
They have no way to heat.

406
00:19:36.381 --> 00:19:39.556
But what they're doing,
they have to just survive,


407
00:19:39.556 --> 00:19:41.800
is cutting down the
rainforest and cutting down


408
00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:43.905
the scrub and shrubs
in the desert,


409
00:19:43.905 --> 00:19:45.873
you have what's called
the desertification,


410
00:19:45.873 --> 00:19:49.256
where you have the growth of
deserts going on exponentially.


411
00:19:49.256 --> 00:19:50.981
You can take maps
from 40 years ago


412
00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:53.812
and now and just see the
growth of this dead zone.


413
00:19:53.812 --> 00:19:54.985
Why?

414
00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:56.504
You have three billion
people that don't even have,


415
00:19:56.504 --> 00:19:58.748
even if they've had
access to fossil fuels,


416
00:19:58.748 --> 00:20:01.992
they don't have access,
this is how they're living.


417
00:20:01.992 --> 00:20:04.063
It's not only that
three billion people


418
00:20:04.063 --> 00:20:06.307
don't have access
to energy sources,


419
00:20:06.307 --> 00:20:08.551
it's also that their way of life

420
00:20:08.551 --> 00:20:11.519
is under constant
assault by our own,


421
00:20:11.519 --> 00:20:16.386
primarily through the financial
system that imposes debt


422
00:20:16.386 --> 00:20:17.939
through development loans

423
00:20:17.939 --> 00:20:21.288
and other mechanisms
on most of the world,


424
00:20:21.288 --> 00:20:23.807
who then must in order
to meet the debt payments


425
00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:26.776
must convert their
environment into commodities


426
00:20:26.776 --> 00:20:29.261
and their time and energy

427
00:20:29.261 --> 00:20:31.850
into labor for the
global marketplace.


428
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:35.233
So if you don't include
those kinds of issues


429
00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:37.649
and you're only talking about,

430
00:20:37.649 --> 00:20:40.341
let's bring more
energy to the world,


431
00:20:40.341 --> 00:20:45.484
so that we can raise them
up to be like ourselves.


432
00:20:45.484 --> 00:20:47.693
Come on, it's not working.

433
00:20:47.693 --> 00:20:50.696
Being like ourselves
is not working.


434
00:20:50.696 --> 00:20:52.457
Look at the depression.

435
00:20:52.457 --> 00:20:55.080
Look at the suicide,
look at the addiction,


436
00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.393
look at the obesity,
look at the despair.


437
00:20:58.877 --> 00:21:04.089
This is not a fit
destination to evangelize


438
00:21:04.089 --> 00:21:05.642
throughout the world.

439
00:21:05.642 --> 00:21:07.851
We need some humility here.

440
00:21:07.851 --> 00:21:10.371
The dire emergency in East
Africa, the drought there


441
00:21:10.371 --> 00:21:12.373
exacerbating the hunger crisis.

442
00:21:12.373 --> 00:21:15.273
As many as 20 million
people could be starving


443
00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:18.828
by the middle of this year,
half of them children.


444
00:21:18.828 --> 00:21:21.796
I firmly believe there can
be no peace on this planet


445
00:21:21.796 --> 00:21:24.074
without justice and
there can be no justice


446
00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:25.766
when half the
population of the world


447
00:21:25.766 --> 00:21:28.734
is required to live
in abject poverty


448
00:21:28.734 --> 00:21:32.013
that it's a direct result of
the world's energy system.


449
00:21:32.013 --> 00:21:33.118
So I always liken this,

450
00:21:33.118 --> 00:21:35.741
we're living in this sort
of "The Truman Show".


451
00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:39.883
It's a perfect metaphor for
the world we're living in now


452
00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:41.989
where the people who are
saying we need more oil,


453
00:21:41.989 --> 00:21:46.407
gas and coal until we get
something to replace it,


454
00:21:46.407 --> 00:21:47.374
they're right.

455
00:21:47.374 --> 00:21:49.686
Look what's happening
all over the world.


456
00:21:49.686 --> 00:21:51.032
On the other hand,
the people say,


457
00:21:51.032 --> 00:21:53.034
we can't just keeping
drill baby drill


458
00:21:53.034 --> 00:21:55.071
and burning oil and gas and coal

459
00:21:55.071 --> 00:21:56.797
because we're destroying
the biosphere.


460
00:21:56.797 --> 00:21:59.834
And they're right, now
when both sides are right


461
00:21:59.834 --> 00:22:03.390
and both sides are wrong,
someone's been had,


462
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:07.290
we've been had, by people who
want to deceive us and think


463
00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:10.983
that we're actually
having a legitimate debate


464
00:22:10.983 --> 00:22:13.434
about energy and
the environment.


465
00:22:13.434 --> 00:22:15.816
We are not, we're all Jim Carrey

466
00:22:15.816 --> 00:22:18.853
living in this "Truman
Show" of a construct.


467
00:22:18.853 --> 00:22:20.752
So everyone's saying, well,

468
00:22:20.752 --> 00:22:23.341
we don't have enough
fossil fuels coming out


469
00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:27.310
and the density of energy from
solar and wind isn't enough.


470
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:29.347
So let's build more of these.

471
00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:34.317
Well then you're stuck with
one million years of toxic,


472
00:22:35.732 --> 00:22:40.668
life-killing waste
from nuclear reactors.


473
00:22:40.668 --> 00:22:43.740
Greenhouse gas emissions
would only decrease,


474
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.812
according to a
recent study, by 4%


475
00:22:46.812 --> 00:22:49.539
if we double the amount of
energy that we're getting


476
00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:52.266
from nuclear power by 2050.

477
00:22:52.266 --> 00:22:55.994
Well, that's not a very good
statistic to think about.


478
00:22:55.994 --> 00:22:58.134
Most people think
when nuclear power plant


479
00:22:58.134 --> 00:23:00.723
is running, that you're
somehow getting energy


480
00:23:00.723 --> 00:23:01.931
from the atom directly.

481
00:23:01.931 --> 00:23:03.070
No.

482
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.555
What you're doing is splitting
the atom, as it were,


483
00:23:05.555 --> 00:23:09.663
creating a lot of heat that
boils water, heats water,


484
00:23:09.663 --> 00:23:11.112
it turn a steam engine,

485
00:23:11.112 --> 00:23:12.631
like a choo choo train

486
00:23:12.631 --> 00:23:15.151
in 1849 coming out to the
Gold Rush in California.


487
00:23:15.151 --> 00:23:17.602
That's all a nuclear
power plant is,


488
00:23:17.602 --> 00:23:20.225
except they're stuck with
a million years of waste.


489
00:23:20.225 --> 00:23:21.744
And this is the other problem,

490
00:23:21.744 --> 00:23:26.127
the distribution of the power
from the point that you have


491
00:23:26.127 --> 00:23:28.544
the primary source, by
the time you generate it,


492
00:23:28.544 --> 00:23:31.857
transmit it through the
inefficient transmission lines,


493
00:23:31.857 --> 00:23:35.447
and then the you're wiring
in your device or your home,


494
00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:37.898
you've lost at least 66%.

495
00:23:37.898 --> 00:23:43.006
So 66% of the energy
is completely wasted.


496
00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:47.804
So here's your energy
grid, 12% is a renewable,


497
00:23:47.804 --> 00:23:51.394
the rest is the old system.

498
00:23:51.394 --> 00:23:54.121
So if you plug in
your electric car,


499
00:23:54.121 --> 00:23:58.090
88% of the power is coming
from gas and oil and coal.


500
00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:00.645
The entire world is running

501
00:24:00.645 --> 00:24:03.958
on an energy
paradigm of scarcity,


502
00:24:05.408 --> 00:24:08.307
meaning that there's never
more energy than we generate.


503
00:24:08.307 --> 00:24:10.413
And we lose that energy
as we move it around


504
00:24:10.413 --> 00:24:12.519
and deploy it in different ways.

505
00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:15.694
And so energy is expensive
and energy is difficult


506
00:24:15.694 --> 00:24:17.938
to get to remote areas.

507
00:24:17.938 --> 00:24:20.803
And the energy is important
because of its inputs


508
00:24:20.803 --> 00:24:23.944
in growing food and its
inputs in manufacturing


509
00:24:23.944 --> 00:24:25.186
and its inputs in the economy

510
00:24:25.186 --> 00:24:27.119
and its inputs in
all of these things


511
00:24:27.119 --> 00:24:29.950
that make people's lives better

512
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:32.055
and that solve the
problems that desperately


513
00:24:32.055 --> 00:24:34.575
need to be solved on
the planet right now.


514
00:24:34.575 --> 00:24:36.853
Over-unity is a
very simple idea.


515
00:24:38.337 --> 00:24:40.754
It's that you're getting
more energy out of something


516
00:24:40.754 --> 00:24:42.341
than you're putting into it.

517
00:24:42.341 --> 00:24:46.173
And according to mainstream
science, that's impossible.


518
00:24:46.173 --> 00:24:49.659
What free energy
devices suggest


519
00:24:49.659 --> 00:24:52.421
is that there is
a limitless supply


520
00:24:52.421 --> 00:24:56.666
of usable energy that's
always coming into reality


521
00:24:56.666 --> 00:24:58.392
and that we're not
living in a universe


522
00:24:58.392 --> 00:25:00.256
of fundamental scarcity.

523
00:25:00.256 --> 00:25:02.879
So over-unity is more
than just a breakthrough


524
00:25:02.879 --> 00:25:05.157
that's going to live its
life in a technical vapor.


525
00:25:05.157 --> 00:25:07.850
That's not that, it's
really the ability


526
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.955
of humans to
liberate themselves.


527
00:25:11.716 --> 00:25:13.476
Yes, there is a history,

528
00:25:13.476 --> 00:25:16.237
a long history of
over-unity systems.


529
00:25:16.237 --> 00:25:18.654
For example, Nikola
Tesla had one,


530
00:25:18.654 --> 00:25:21.760
basically his big magnifying
transformer that he had


531
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.006
in Long Island was such
an over-unity system.


532
00:25:26.006 --> 00:25:29.147
He got the entire Earth
itself in resonance.


533
00:25:29.147 --> 00:25:31.563
Everything going on is
feeding energy into the Earth


534
00:25:31.563 --> 00:25:34.186
starts to feed energy into
that wave that he created.


535
00:25:34.186 --> 00:25:37.535
So he gets a lot more
energy in his resonant wave


536
00:25:37.535 --> 00:25:39.951
fed from outside,
from the environment


537
00:25:39.951 --> 00:25:41.711
in the interior of the Earth.

538
00:25:41.711 --> 00:25:44.852
His idea was you could
then put in a tap on it


539
00:25:44.852 --> 00:25:47.683
anywhere else on the
world and extract it free.


540
00:25:47.683 --> 00:25:52.066
And of course JP Morgan's take
on that was, that's foolish.


541
00:25:52.066 --> 00:25:53.551
You can't put a meter on it.

542
00:25:53.551 --> 00:25:58.141
So that actually doomed much
of Tesla's career at that point


543
00:25:58.141 --> 00:26:00.592
when Morgan found
out that he, Tesla,


544
00:26:00.592 --> 00:26:04.527
was going to produce
the energy freely.


545
00:26:04.527 --> 00:26:05.770
But I love this quote,

546
00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:07.737
"If you wanna find the
secrets of the universe,


547
00:26:07.737 --> 00:26:10.671
think in terms of energy,
frequency and vibration."


548
00:26:10.671 --> 00:26:14.572
Now the reason he said
that is that when you use


549
00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:16.988
what's called a very
high voltage system,


550
00:26:16.988 --> 00:26:19.300
you can tap in to
what Professor Casimir


551
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.338
called this zero
point energy field.


552
00:26:22.338 --> 00:26:24.823
Some people called it
the quantum vacuum.


553
00:26:24.823 --> 00:26:27.170
Other people like
Professor Dyrak


554
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:30.346
modestly called it the Dyrak
-C.

555
00:26:30.346 --> 00:26:33.038
And we just tested
a device last month


556
00:26:33.038 --> 00:26:34.315
in the Arizona desert,

557
00:26:34.315 --> 00:26:36.939
you'll see in a moment,
that is based on that.


558
00:26:37.733 --> 00:26:41.495
Nobody is really trying to
get, for example, over-unity,


559
00:26:41.495 --> 00:26:44.015
more energy out of
something than you put in


560
00:26:44.015 --> 00:26:46.431
because it's assumed
that that is impossible.


561
00:26:46.431 --> 00:26:49.192
Well, that might be impossible,

562
00:26:49.192 --> 00:26:51.781
but only if you don't
really understand


563
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:53.852
the fabric of reality itself.

564
00:26:53.852 --> 00:26:55.371
They just can't believe it.

565
00:26:55.371 --> 00:26:57.925
Especially engineers,
because I know


566
00:26:57.925 --> 00:27:00.134
how we were taught, right?

567
00:27:00.134 --> 00:27:01.619
There is no vacuum energy.

568
00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:03.966
You're just a coup when
you think so, right?


569
00:27:03.966 --> 00:27:05.554
If they took a
little more physics,


570
00:27:05.554 --> 00:27:07.417
they would go, well maybe.

571
00:27:07.417 --> 00:27:08.626
It's not a small thing.

572
00:27:08.626 --> 00:27:13.354
It's not a matter of finding
proof for some technology,


573
00:27:13.354 --> 00:27:16.703
for some invention and
convincing everybody of it.


574
00:27:16.703 --> 00:27:19.429
You can't convince
somebody of something


575
00:27:19.429 --> 00:27:25.712
that so totally contradicts

576
00:27:25.712 --> 00:27:28.991
their basic assumptions
about the universe.


577
00:27:28.991 --> 00:27:33.547
But what if there's a pool
of energy available to us


578
00:27:33.547 --> 00:27:35.584
that we didn't even
think was possible


579
00:27:35.584 --> 00:27:36.861
because we're operating on these

580
00:27:36.861 --> 00:27:39.001
100-plus year old assumptions.

581
00:27:39.001 --> 00:27:40.727
We can't find this excess energy

582
00:27:40.727 --> 00:27:43.384
simply because no
one's looking for it.


583
00:27:43.384 --> 00:27:46.767
So-called empty space
isn't really empty at all.


584
00:27:46.767 --> 00:27:49.425
It's actually full of energy.

585
00:27:49.425 --> 00:27:51.979
So instead of being like
kind of a quiet, empty lake,


586
00:27:51.979 --> 00:27:53.118
it's more like the froth

587
00:27:53.118 --> 00:27:55.465
at the base of a
waterfall or something.


588
00:27:55.465 --> 00:27:57.640
But when you go to
look at the numbers,


589
00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.504
you find out that
there's enough energy


590
00:27:59.504 --> 00:28:01.264
in the volume of a coffee cup

591
00:28:01.264 --> 00:28:03.646
to evaporate all
the world's oceans


592
00:28:03.646 --> 00:28:05.337
if you could get it all up.

593
00:28:06.166 --> 00:28:11.067
And here we have a car from

594
00:28:11.067 --> 00:28:14.450
Now look at this old car
and it was pulling energy


595
00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:16.521
out of, they just said
out of the environment,


596
00:28:16.521 --> 00:28:18.454
they couldn't quantify what,

597
00:28:18.454 --> 00:28:20.663
but they had the
correct frequency.


598
00:28:20.663 --> 00:28:23.597
And this had a battery and
some wiring and it was running,


599
00:28:23.597 --> 00:28:27.152
running, running, running
around without being plugged in.


600
00:28:27.152 --> 00:28:28.706
Memo to Tesla Motors,

601
00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:30.708
go and research this and
get rid of your plug-ins.


602
00:28:31.605 --> 00:28:34.643
And this is one of
my favorites, 1902,


603
00:28:34.643 --> 00:28:38.612
a farmer and engineer named
Stubblefield with Tesla.


604
00:28:38.612 --> 00:28:41.546
He had something they
called the Earth battery


605
00:28:41.546 --> 00:28:43.513
or the Stubblefield battery

606
00:28:43.513 --> 00:28:47.172
and it had rods going into
the Earth and some wiring


607
00:28:47.172 --> 00:28:51.107
and it was picking up
this magnetic flux field


608
00:28:51.107 --> 00:28:53.075
of the planet.

609
00:28:53.075 --> 00:28:54.386
And he was running his farm

610
00:28:54.386 --> 00:28:58.114
and Tesla was there
with him, 1902.


611
00:28:58.114 --> 00:29:01.117
So when I say 100
years, lost century, no.


612
00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.775
I do not wish to
talk about it myself.


613
00:29:03.775 --> 00:29:06.778
And I've been the victim of
quite a bit of suppression.


614
00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:10.644
So has any other legitimate
researcher in this area.


615
00:29:10.644 --> 00:29:12.335
The government is
protecting the oil industry


616
00:29:12.335 --> 00:29:13.785
because they're in bed together.

617
00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:15.856
Tremendous amounts
of contributions


618
00:29:15.856 --> 00:29:19.446
for politicians come from
these huge companies.


619
00:29:19.446 --> 00:29:22.345
And these huge companies have
been covering up for years


620
00:29:22.345 --> 00:29:24.278
what we're doing to the planet.

621
00:29:25.521 --> 00:29:28.662
Today, we don't have
so much big kingdoms.


622
00:29:28.662 --> 00:29:31.803
We have cartels, we have a
whole set of cartels in an area,


623
00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:33.080
interlocking corporations.

624
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.220
And behind this we
have a few people


625
00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:38.499
who are quite wealthy
and who own most things.


626
00:29:38.499 --> 00:29:40.881
Any time we have a
very powerful cartel


627
00:29:40.881 --> 00:29:43.194
or set of people that
control a lot of things,


628
00:29:43.194 --> 00:29:49.407
that resists any means of
changing its inflow of control


629
00:29:49.407 --> 00:29:53.756
and its inflow of funds
and money and its power.


630
00:29:53.756 --> 00:29:55.344
Everybody's trying
to be the big monkey.


631
00:29:55.344 --> 00:29:56.966
It's really as simple as that.

632
00:29:56.966 --> 00:30:00.073
Here we have all the methods.

633
00:30:00.073 --> 00:30:01.833
Some of these are common
sense where every one of these


634
00:30:01.833 --> 00:30:03.490
are ones I have encountered

635
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:06.700
and investigated
personally with geniuses,


636
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.772
engineering geniuses
and physics geniuses,


637
00:30:09.772 --> 00:30:14.156
but strategically
impaired inventors.


638
00:30:14.156 --> 00:30:15.019
Black shelving.

639
00:30:15.019 --> 00:30:16.675
So someone comes along,

640
00:30:16.675 --> 00:30:19.299
they offer you 20
million for your device.


641
00:30:19.299 --> 00:30:21.715
It's a corporation,
they put it on a shelf.


642
00:30:22.543 --> 00:30:23.441
Boom.

643
00:30:23.441 --> 00:30:24.822
National security orders.

644
00:30:24.822 --> 00:30:26.962
We're gonna show
you one from a man


645
00:30:26.962 --> 00:30:28.377
we just met with.

646
00:30:28.377 --> 00:30:29.792
Patent seizures,

647
00:30:29.792 --> 00:30:32.381
financial entanglements
from investors


648
00:30:32.381 --> 00:30:34.176
because they're doing
their whole business


649
00:30:34.176 --> 00:30:36.523
and legal strategy wrong.

650
00:30:36.523 --> 00:30:38.801
Legal entanglements where
they end up in court.


651
00:30:39.975 --> 00:30:41.286
Threats to the individuals.

652
00:30:41.286 --> 00:30:43.219
I had a guy under
contract building one.


653
00:30:43.219 --> 00:30:45.290
All you had to do was have
some thugs come in and say,


654
00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:46.567
you, your wife, you're dead,

655
00:30:46.567 --> 00:30:49.398
you stop this and he stopped.

656
00:30:49.398 --> 00:30:51.193
And then scientific fraud.

657
00:30:51.193 --> 00:30:54.713
The more powerful the agency,
the more powerful the group,


658
00:30:54.713 --> 00:30:57.061
the more powerful the cartel,

659
00:30:57.061 --> 00:30:59.960
the more they will resort
not only to legal means,


660
00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:04.585
but to extralegal means to
suppress their competition.


661
00:31:04.585 --> 00:31:06.795
For example, the greatest
espionage in the world


662
00:31:06.795 --> 00:31:09.694
is industrial espionage between
one corporation and another.


663
00:31:09.694 --> 00:31:11.040
Right here in America.

664
00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.662
They're the ones that
hire all the spies


665
00:31:12.662 --> 00:31:14.526
and their spooky equipment
and everything like that,


666
00:31:14.526 --> 00:31:17.840
by far more than
the intel agents do.


667
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.980
And it's not one
cartel, there are many,


668
00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:22.086
many groups in energy
and each of those


669
00:31:22.086 --> 00:31:24.329
has become very powerful
in its own area.


670
00:31:24.329 --> 00:31:26.400
And each one does
not wish to see


671
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.161
simple little electrical taps

672
00:31:28.161 --> 00:31:30.853
pulling out enormous
energy from the vacuum.


673
00:31:30.853 --> 00:31:32.096
They would much rather see

674
00:31:32.096 --> 00:31:34.823
you burning a lot
more oil and so forth.


675
00:31:34.823 --> 00:31:38.136
So there's something
nefarious afoot.


676
00:31:38.136 --> 00:31:41.415
It kind of makes sense,
threatening oil monopoly


677
00:31:41.415 --> 00:31:43.486
and things like that, okay,

678
00:31:43.486 --> 00:31:46.869
so it, I said pretty early on,

679
00:31:46.869 --> 00:31:49.976
the problem is
suppression, wasn't really


680
00:31:49.976 --> 00:31:51.874
how do I make a
free energy machine?


681
00:31:51.874 --> 00:31:54.670
It's how do I not
get suppressed?


682
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:56.775
Because like what's the point,

683
00:31:56.775 --> 00:31:59.537
if you make it and it's
just gonna get clobbered.


684
00:31:59.537 --> 00:32:02.022
And then you have
a really big one,


685
00:32:02.022 --> 00:32:05.750
media corruption or why
doesn't everyone in the world


686
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:07.579
know these things have existed?

687
00:32:07.579 --> 00:32:10.065
Because as you'll
see in a little bit,


688
00:32:10.065 --> 00:32:13.516
the media, at a certain
high level, have operatives


689
00:32:13.516 --> 00:32:17.693
from the intelligence community
who kill stories on demand.


690
00:32:17.693 --> 00:32:21.007
And then the worst
of course, Wetworks.


691
00:32:21.007 --> 00:32:23.112
It's not totally
mafia type stuff.


692
00:32:23.112 --> 00:32:25.425
It's not like, you
just flat get shot.


693
00:32:25.425 --> 00:32:27.013
There's some of that.

694
00:32:27.013 --> 00:32:29.360
The typical threat's
threat to the family, right?


695
00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.949
Typical mafia, right?

696
00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:35.090
Just watch "The Godfather",
see how they work, right?


697
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.747
There's an interesting
record of people


698
00:32:37.747 --> 00:32:39.888
that have come up
with new alternatives


699
00:32:39.888 --> 00:32:44.858
to the oil and gas industry
who have met untimely demises.


700
00:32:44.858 --> 00:32:46.308
I don't know if
you'd say that's true


701
00:32:46.308 --> 00:32:48.966
in terms of Nikola
Tesla specifically,


702
00:32:48.966 --> 00:32:53.660
but he was hit by a taxi
cab back in the early 1930s


703
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:55.800
and didn't die immediately,

704
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:59.562
but then died alone in a
hospital room a few years later.


705
00:32:59.562 --> 00:33:01.357
When they found out that Tesla

706
00:33:01.357 --> 00:33:05.120
had passed away in the hotel
New Yorker, they came in,


707
00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.709
they had the manager of
the hotel open the safe


708
00:33:08.709 --> 00:33:11.540
and they took all
of Tesla's papers.


709
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:14.129
So here you have an
actual FBI document


710
00:33:14.129 --> 00:33:16.959
and the Department of
Defense is demanding


711
00:33:16.959 --> 00:33:19.928
they turn over what
they seized in 1943.


712
00:33:19.928 --> 00:33:21.757
Now this used to
be an urban myth.


713
00:33:21.757 --> 00:33:24.622
Oh well he had these secret
inventions and papers


714
00:33:24.622 --> 00:33:27.694
and the government stole
it, no, it's right here.


715
00:33:27.694 --> 00:33:30.697
That technology and
what was in those boxes,


716
00:33:30.697 --> 00:33:33.942
what was written in those
papers, we do not know.


717
00:33:33.942 --> 00:33:36.185
And we may not ever know.

718
00:33:36.185 --> 00:33:38.360
So they go in,
the FBI takes it,


719
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.328
here the Department of
Defense years later is saying,


720
00:33:41.328 --> 00:33:45.574
we want all those papers
that you confiscated in 1943


721
00:33:45.574 --> 00:33:48.163
upon Nikola Tesla's death.

722
00:33:48.163 --> 00:33:53.099
And then you have just flat
out patent confiscation


723
00:33:53.099 --> 00:33:54.963
through national
security orders.


724
00:33:54.963 --> 00:33:55.756
Look at this.

725
00:33:55.756 --> 00:33:56.930
This is 12 years ago.

726
00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.555
5,135 inventions seized under
national security orders.


727
00:34:02.177 --> 00:34:06.940
A 1971 list includes
patents for solar voltaic


728
00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.770
that were subject to restriction

729
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:12.359
because they were more
than 20% efficient.


730
00:34:12.359 --> 00:34:14.948
The most efficient solar
panel you can get right now


731
00:34:14.948 --> 00:34:18.262
in 2022 is 22.8%.

732
00:34:18.262 --> 00:34:21.713
These were way past that,
how many years was that?


733
00:34:21.713 --> 00:34:23.163
51 years ago.

734
00:34:24.509 --> 00:34:25.752
Okay, we're not talking

735
00:34:25.752 --> 00:34:27.926
about an extraterrestrial spacecraft

736
00:34:27.926 --> 00:34:30.481
or anti-gravity or
gravity control.


737
00:34:30.481 --> 00:34:33.863
We're talking about just a
super efficient solar panel.


738
00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:35.900
Those are confiscated.

739
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.075
This is one of my favorite
statements of this report.


740
00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:40.111
One may fairly ask if disclosure

741
00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:43.045
of such technologies could
really have been detrimental


742
00:34:43.045 --> 00:34:46.600
to the national security
or whether the opposite


743
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.878
would be closer to the truth.

744
00:34:48.878 --> 00:34:50.190
Yeah, we hear the words

745
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.813
vital interests of
national security.


746
00:34:52.813 --> 00:34:54.608
Well, what we're really
talking about there


747
00:34:54.608 --> 00:34:55.575
in terms of Iraq,

748
00:34:55.575 --> 00:34:57.784
for example, in the early 2000s,

749
00:34:57.784 --> 00:34:59.027
which was all trumped up,

750
00:34:59.027 --> 00:35:00.683
there were no weapons
of mass destruction.


751
00:35:00.683 --> 00:35:02.858
That's what was being
touted by the media,


752
00:35:02.858 --> 00:35:05.723
So Judith Miller at the
New York Times and others,


753
00:35:05.723 --> 00:35:07.552
to justify what we were doing

754
00:35:07.552 --> 00:35:09.347
to get rid of Saddam Hussein.

755
00:35:09.347 --> 00:35:10.797
But in fact,

756
00:35:10.797 --> 00:35:12.523
the only national security
implication of that


757
00:35:12.523 --> 00:35:17.321
was the oil industries,
what they get from it.


758
00:35:17.321 --> 00:35:20.082
But again, what does
national security mean here?


759
00:35:20.082 --> 00:35:24.431
Oil, gas, Petrodollar, Goldman
Sachs, JP Morgan Chase,


760
00:35:24.431 --> 00:35:28.987
that's the national security
in the abused corrupt system.


761
00:35:28.987 --> 00:35:32.646
It's a policy that the
military seems to feel


762
00:35:32.646 --> 00:35:34.890
is necessary for
national security.


763
00:35:34.890 --> 00:35:36.098
However, at this point,

764
00:35:36.098 --> 00:35:39.274
we often wonder 50
years after World War II


765
00:35:39.274 --> 00:35:43.588
and the Cold War, whether such
sequestering is necessary,


766
00:35:43.588 --> 00:35:46.626
especially when fossil
fuels are a major cause


767
00:35:46.626 --> 00:35:48.835
of global warming.

768
00:35:48.835 --> 00:35:52.149
So here we have a
man, he was fired.


769
00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:55.083
Dr. Tom Malone, he
was a PhD physicist.


770
00:35:55.083 --> 00:35:58.051
He was a patent
examiner and he saw


771
00:35:58.051 --> 00:36:00.364
these amazing technologies
being confiscated.


772
00:36:00.364 --> 00:36:03.850
This is not a conspiracy
theory and he blew the whistle.


773
00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.127
They fired him.

774
00:36:05.127 --> 00:36:07.405
'Cause he saw things that
would save the planet.


775
00:36:07.405 --> 00:36:09.545
Now this is way back
in the '80s or '90s.


776
00:36:09.545 --> 00:36:11.478
Patent sequestering,

777
00:36:11.478 --> 00:36:13.342
which is actually
called secretizing,


778
00:36:13.342 --> 00:36:15.033
public needs to know at least

779
00:36:15.033 --> 00:36:17.450
that every major military agency

780
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.522
has a representative
at the patent office.


781
00:36:20.522 --> 00:36:22.558
Patent office in its
current approach is,


782
00:36:22.558 --> 00:36:24.077
it's actually breaking the law,

783
00:36:24.077 --> 00:36:26.769
is trying to make
happy the physicists


784
00:36:26.769 --> 00:36:29.462
who are with American
Physical Society,


785
00:36:29.462 --> 00:36:33.051
to keep them in power with
their ideas you might say,


786
00:36:33.051 --> 00:36:35.951
and withhold from public
use good inventions


787
00:36:35.951 --> 00:36:39.057
that could solve our problems
like the energy crisis.


788
00:36:39.057 --> 00:36:40.887
Boeing had just
finished some work


789
00:36:40.887 --> 00:36:43.441
on some propulsion system.

790
00:36:43.441 --> 00:36:45.547
Boeing had done it for the
Air Force and they finished


791
00:36:45.547 --> 00:36:48.205
the job and then they
applied to their customer


792
00:36:48.205 --> 00:36:50.448
at the Air Force for permission

793
00:36:50.448 --> 00:36:53.106
to use it on Boeing's
commercial airlines.


794
00:36:53.106 --> 00:36:54.452
And they were denied.

795
00:36:54.452 --> 00:36:56.351
An example of the
ongoing suppression


796
00:36:56.351 --> 00:36:59.940
of things that seemed
to be innocuous


797
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.220
and a slight improvement
in technology.


798
00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.809
So, T. Henry Moray had
a device, no input energy


799
00:37:06.809 --> 00:37:09.847
once he got it set up,
output 50 kilowatts,


800
00:37:09.847 --> 00:37:12.263
he had multiple
assassination attempts


801
00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:14.714
and finally was
bankrupted in his lab.


802
00:37:14.714 --> 00:37:17.958
This is the 1930s.

803
00:37:17.958 --> 00:37:20.651
There is absolutely no
question that T. Henry Moray


804
00:37:20.651 --> 00:37:23.688
had a system that produced
about 50 kilowatts


805
00:37:23.688 --> 00:37:26.312
out of a 55 pound box.

806
00:37:26.312 --> 00:37:29.280
There's all kinds
of skullduggery
that happened there.


807
00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:31.869
The Russians even tried
to kidnap him at one time.


808
00:37:31.869 --> 00:37:34.734
It reads like James Bond
movie, but it's real.


809
00:37:34.734 --> 00:37:36.356
It really happened
and it really happened


810
00:37:36.356 --> 00:37:37.771
here in the United States.

811
00:37:37.771 --> 00:37:39.290
He was a friend of mine.

812
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:42.949
He was a Wright Patterson
Project Blue Book guy.


813
00:37:42.949 --> 00:37:44.122
But when he retired,

814
00:37:44.122 --> 00:37:47.919
he built a device that you
could put on the air intake


815
00:37:47.919 --> 00:37:49.956
of a car, this is in the '80s.

816
00:37:49.956 --> 00:37:51.544
Where you would get

817
00:37:51.544 --> 00:37:55.927
anywhere from 20 to 40
some percent more range,


818
00:37:55.927 --> 00:37:58.447
miles per gallon
on conventional.


819
00:37:58.447 --> 00:38:01.450
I treat air and out of air,

820
00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:05.005
I make it more than
just providing oxygen


821
00:38:05.005 --> 00:38:07.180
for the combustion process.

822
00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.907
There are combustion
stimulating molecules


823
00:38:09.907 --> 00:38:13.117
and radicals generated
in this process.


824
00:38:14.014 --> 00:38:15.223
Thunderstorm in a bottle.

825
00:38:16.154 --> 00:38:19.744
He had his lab vandalized,

826
00:38:19.744 --> 00:38:23.369
everything stolen, bomb
threats, et cetera.


827
00:38:23.369 --> 00:38:28.822
This is a colonel who put
his entire life savings


828
00:38:28.822 --> 00:38:30.686
into something in the '80s

829
00:38:30.686 --> 00:38:32.412
that would've been
a game changer,


830
00:38:32.412 --> 00:38:33.896
but it wasn't a
free energy device,


831
00:38:33.896 --> 00:38:36.278
it wasn't something just
running out of the zero point,


832
00:38:36.278 --> 00:38:38.349
it would've just just
gotten more efficiency


833
00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:40.213
and cleaned up the air.

834
00:38:40.213 --> 00:38:41.939
Environmental
Protection Agency


835
00:38:41.939 --> 00:38:45.356
is a bit of a dictatorial
police agency.


836
00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:47.772
They call themselves
a protecting agency,


837
00:38:47.772 --> 00:38:49.118
but they are a police agency,

838
00:38:49.118 --> 00:38:54.158
EPA cannot approve a
fuel saving device.


839
00:38:54.538 --> 00:38:58.438
They put out reams
of documentation


840
00:38:58.438 --> 00:39:00.716
stating that something
will not work.


841
00:39:01.855 --> 00:39:03.857
This gentleman
actually took a device


842
00:39:03.857 --> 00:39:06.239
from a Russian
immigrant and another


843
00:39:06.239 --> 00:39:07.551
and kind of packaged it.

844
00:39:07.551 --> 00:39:10.519
He didn't actually
understand it that much.


845
00:39:10.519 --> 00:39:14.316
And you had 26, almost 27 watts

846
00:39:14.316 --> 00:39:18.700
going in 7,460 watts
going out and tested


847
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:21.185
and verified by multiple labs.

848
00:39:21.185 --> 00:39:23.912
Gray started developing
this idea eight years ago.


849
00:39:23.912 --> 00:39:25.085
For the past year and a half,

850
00:39:25.085 --> 00:39:26.224
he's been trying to get someone

851
00:39:26.224 --> 00:39:27.812
in the US government interested.

852
00:39:27.812 --> 00:39:29.711
So far, he's had little luck.

853
00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:32.023
Gray says he's
been getting the same reaction


854
00:39:32.023 --> 00:39:35.130
he got 30 years ago when he
first proposed his theory.


855
00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:37.546
Get this guy outta
here, he is crazy.


856
00:39:37.546 --> 00:39:39.410
Gray
says it's paranoia.


857
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.137
The scientific community isn't
willing to accept teachings


858
00:39:42.137 --> 00:39:44.104
opposite all previous learning.

859
00:39:44.104 --> 00:39:45.658
And the military
aerospace industry


860
00:39:45.658 --> 00:39:47.453
is afraid to admit decades
and billions of dollars


861
00:39:47.453 --> 00:39:49.800
worth of research
have been wasted.


862
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.457
Now, unfortunately,

863
00:39:51.457 --> 00:39:55.599
this disappeared because
he actually took the ideas


864
00:39:55.599 --> 00:40:00.638
from some geniuses and was
trying to make a lot of money.


865
00:40:00.638 --> 00:40:05.056
And so his became, I'm calling
this crazy inventor syndrome.


866
00:40:05.056 --> 00:40:08.405
It's not very nice, but I
mean it's kind of crazy.


867
00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:09.992
And here's why it's crazy.

868
00:40:09.992 --> 00:40:12.547
They think I have the best thing

869
00:40:12.547 --> 00:40:13.893
since sliced bread

870
00:40:13.893 --> 00:40:16.136
and the world's gonna
beat a path to my door.


871
00:40:16.136 --> 00:40:19.243
And they don't realize they're
gonna have corrupt interests


872
00:40:19.243 --> 00:40:20.762
from the national
security state,


873
00:40:20.762 --> 00:40:24.282
corporations and all kinds
of other people stop them.


874
00:40:24.282 --> 00:40:27.009
So they think they're gonna
do a normal investment


875
00:40:27.009 --> 00:40:30.703
and normal venture
capital and patent it


876
00:40:30.703 --> 00:40:35.155
or keep the secret sauce of how
it works away from everyone.


877
00:40:35.155 --> 00:40:38.573
And in every single
case for 100 plus years,


878
00:40:38.573 --> 00:40:41.541
they've taken that
knowledge to their grave.


879
00:40:41.541 --> 00:40:43.129
You're seeing the
paranoid inventor.


880
00:40:43.129 --> 00:40:44.510
Plenty of stories on those guys.

881
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:46.339
It's my precious.

882
00:40:48.272 --> 00:40:51.724
My precious.

883
00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.315
I can't share my secret.

884
00:40:57.315 --> 00:40:58.765
Everybody will take
it from me, right?


885
00:40:58.765 --> 00:41:00.318
This paranoid, I have it.

886
00:41:00.318 --> 00:41:02.838
This has worth gazillions
dollars and everything else.


887
00:41:02.838 --> 00:41:04.322
And they're so naive,

888
00:41:04.322 --> 00:41:07.325
have no idea that first they
think they're the first, right.


889
00:41:07.325 --> 00:41:09.362
Have no idea the history of this

890
00:41:09.362 --> 00:41:11.053
and what happens to the others.

891
00:41:11.053 --> 00:41:14.712
So having done that
for 31 years now,


892
00:41:14.712 --> 00:41:16.058
I have been dealing with people

893
00:41:16.058 --> 00:41:18.509
with these devices since 1991.

894
00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:21.339
Almost all of them fall into
some part of this syndrome.


895
00:41:21.339 --> 00:41:22.686
And it's a tragedy.

896
00:41:22.686 --> 00:41:23.963
You'll see the device,

897
00:41:23.963 --> 00:41:25.171
I'll have engineers
come in and test it.


898
00:41:25.171 --> 00:41:27.276
They go, oh no, I'm
gonna keep it secret.


899
00:41:27.276 --> 00:41:31.211
Nobody can know but me and I
need to make a bunch of money.


900
00:41:31.211 --> 00:41:34.111
They wanna be the next
Rockefeller of energy.


901
00:41:34.111 --> 00:41:35.630
And the next thing
you know, they're dead


902
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:40.566
or the device is confiscated
or it vanishes in a buyout.


903
00:41:41.774 --> 00:41:43.292
So this guy had
the same problem.


904
00:41:43.292 --> 00:41:46.468
He had a device, they have
it, they're still running,


905
00:41:46.468 --> 00:41:50.127
but they think that no one
can know this with them.


906
00:41:50.127 --> 00:41:52.785
They're buying
into the paranoia.


907
00:41:52.785 --> 00:41:56.098
My answer is, open source
it, dump it on the internet,


908
00:41:56.098 --> 00:41:57.410
blockchain or any way you can.

909
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:59.757
You have no patent, no
intellectual property.


910
00:41:59.757 --> 00:42:01.310
The whole world knows about it.

911
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:05.798
In every scientific lab in
the world can reproduce it.


912
00:42:05.798 --> 00:42:07.696
We're gonna get to this
strategy in a minute.


913
00:42:07.696 --> 00:42:11.700
That's how we go, we gotta
do that.


914
00:42:14.496 --> 00:42:17.672
Because the very
definition of insanity


915
00:42:17.672 --> 00:42:19.570
is doing the same
thing over and over


916
00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:20.675
and expecting a
different result,


917
00:42:20.675 --> 00:42:22.815
that's attributed to Einstein.

918
00:42:22.815 --> 00:42:24.748
But how true is that here?

919
00:42:24.748 --> 00:42:27.267
So we have to
change our strategy.


920
00:42:27.267 --> 00:42:29.649
Many of these
inventors are really good


921
00:42:29.649 --> 00:42:31.513
at the technical stuff,

922
00:42:31.513 --> 00:42:33.757
but they're not
great communicators.


923
00:42:33.757 --> 00:42:36.898
This power, it's something
I have given my life for,


924
00:42:36.898 --> 00:42:40.729
for you the people, now set up
this demonstration for y'all.


925
00:42:40.729 --> 00:42:43.145
You don't have to be
a rocket scientist.


926
00:42:43.145 --> 00:42:45.700
They're not good at business.

927
00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:48.599
They're not, like God can
make technical geniuses


928
00:42:48.599 --> 00:42:50.739
and he can make
business savvy people,


929
00:42:50.739 --> 00:42:54.018
but rarely do the two come
together in one person.


930
00:42:54.018 --> 00:42:57.505
This story is fascinating
because he had a tiny,


931
00:42:57.505 --> 00:42:59.058
you know what, 17 watts,

932
00:42:59.058 --> 00:43:02.026
a 20 watt light bulb, it
was putting out 200 watts,


933
00:43:02.026 --> 00:43:04.753
10 to 15 times more
output than input.


934
00:43:04.753 --> 00:43:08.170
And this is in the '80s,
this is 40 years ago.


935
00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.795
I was not convinced probably
on the first three times


936
00:43:11.795 --> 00:43:13.866
that I saw the device
and saw it tested


937
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:20.044
that it indeed it put out
more energy than it took in.


938
00:43:20.044 --> 00:43:24.152
I am convinced now, I was
a little bit prejudiced


939
00:43:24.152 --> 00:43:27.224
and like all people that come
up with devices like this,


940
00:43:27.224 --> 00:43:28.501
you think they're wrong.

941
00:43:28.501 --> 00:43:30.158
And so you go down
to prove him wrong


942
00:43:30.158 --> 00:43:31.815
if you're that interested.

943
00:43:31.815 --> 00:43:33.713
And I was not able
to prove him wrong,


944
00:43:33.713 --> 00:43:35.370
nor were the people
that I was with


945
00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:36.958
able to prove him wrong.

946
00:43:36.958 --> 00:43:38.615
And here's what happened.

947
00:43:38.615 --> 00:43:41.203
He kept the whole
thing so secret.


948
00:43:41.203 --> 00:43:42.791
It was going through
a patenting process,


949
00:43:42.791 --> 00:43:44.379
but even the patent application

950
00:43:44.379 --> 00:43:46.277
left out a lot of
the secret sauce.


951
00:43:46.277 --> 00:43:49.004
Most of these inventors
do this, fatal mistake.


952
00:43:49.004 --> 00:43:52.905
And what happened is that
it was all covered up,


953
00:43:52.905 --> 00:43:54.769
that he actually
was taken to court,


954
00:43:54.769 --> 00:43:56.633
patent office said,
even though he had proof


955
00:43:56.633 --> 00:44:00.084
that it worked for multiple
very esteemed scientists,


956
00:44:00.084 --> 00:44:03.225
patent examiners that proved
that the thing actually did


957
00:44:03.225 --> 00:44:05.400
as he said it did.

958
00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.298
And he got nowhere, he
took this to his grave.


959
00:44:07.298 --> 00:44:10.716
Look at this video that
you're gonna see in a moment.


960
00:44:10.716 --> 00:44:11.648
Mr. Newman

961
00:44:11.648 --> 00:44:13.719
has been fighting for
a patent for years.


962
00:44:13.719 --> 00:44:17.170
Many therefore considered it
ironic when a federal judge


963
00:44:17.170 --> 00:44:19.690
appointed the former head
of the patent office,


964
00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:21.140
William Schuyler,

965
00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:24.350
to decide if Newman's
devices did or did not work.


966
00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:26.179
Mr. Schuyler, who
is also considered


967
00:44:26.179 --> 00:44:28.526
to be an expert on
electrical engineering


968
00:44:28.526 --> 00:44:31.288
didn't take long to
make his decision.


969
00:44:31.288 --> 00:44:35.085
In report of the special
master, Mr. Schuyler states,


970
00:44:35.085 --> 00:44:37.432
"Evidence before the
court is overwhelming


971
00:44:37.432 --> 00:44:39.020
that Newman has built
and tested a prototype


972
00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.505
of his invention in
which the output energy


973
00:44:41.505 --> 00:44:44.508
exceeds the external
input energy.


974
00:44:44.508 --> 00:44:48.063
Therefore, there is no
contradictory factual evidence."


975
00:44:48.063 --> 00:44:50.721
For the layman that
means the machine works.


976
00:44:50.721 --> 00:44:53.517
The expert then goes on
to say "The patent office


977
00:44:53.517 --> 00:44:56.347
finding that such a
machine is impossible


978
00:44:56.347 --> 00:44:59.488
is clearly erroneous."

979
00:44:59.488 --> 00:45:01.974
Mr. Schuyler also found
that the patent office


980
00:45:01.974 --> 00:45:05.149
intentionally did not
consider the formalities


981
00:45:05.149 --> 00:45:07.980
of Mr. Newman's
application for a patent.


982
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.707
Why wouldn't you go
along again with a master


983
00:45:10.707 --> 00:45:13.088
that's former head
of the patent office


984
00:45:13.088 --> 00:45:17.610
who has credentials that the
judge called outstanding.


985
00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:19.474
Why wouldn't you go
along with the man


986
00:45:19.474 --> 00:45:22.857
that you recommended
in granting a patent?


987
00:45:22.857 --> 00:45:24.790
You ask mean
questions, don't you?


988
00:45:26.205 --> 00:45:28.621
I think you'd have to
address that question


989
00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:30.071
to our present Commissioner.

990
00:45:31.279 --> 00:45:33.488
Are you
acting on his orders?


991
00:45:33.488 --> 00:45:35.386
You might say that, yes.

992
00:45:35.386 --> 00:45:36.249
There you go.

993
00:45:37.837 --> 00:45:41.082
Operability or
utility is a rejection


994
00:45:41.082 --> 00:45:43.325
that virtually none of
the patent examiners


995
00:45:43.325 --> 00:45:44.913
and there's almost 5,000 of us,

996
00:45:44.913 --> 00:45:49.159
were allowed to use in
any of our applications.


997
00:45:49.159 --> 00:45:53.094
The supervisor particularly
always said that, oh,


998
00:45:53.094 --> 00:45:54.543
that's something only
if you're dealing


999
00:45:54.543 --> 00:45:56.614
with energy inventions.

1000
00:45:56.614 --> 00:45:59.100
So what we find is that
throughout the patent office,


1001
00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.895
that rejection for something

1002
00:46:00.895 --> 00:46:04.415
that we personally would
feel would not be operable,


1003
00:46:04.415 --> 00:46:07.867
was not a judgment we
were allowed to make.


1004
00:46:07.867 --> 00:46:10.559
Except if we're in that
security department


1005
00:46:10.559 --> 00:46:14.356
that deals with energy and
propulsion types of inventions.


1006
00:46:15.461 --> 00:46:18.464
Here we have a
brilliant device, again,


1007
00:46:18.464 --> 00:46:21.743
almost 40 years ago, look
at the input and output,


1008
00:46:23.262 --> 00:46:24.781
tested over and over again.

1009
00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:29.268
...3 milliwatts,
output 223,000 watts.


1010
00:46:29.268 --> 00:46:34.307
That's 22.4 kilowatts, that's
plenty to run your car,


1011
00:46:35.515 --> 00:46:37.241
your Tesla motor.

1012
00:46:37.241 --> 00:46:40.555
Now continuously output,
if needed on demand.


1013
00:46:40.555 --> 00:46:43.385
So this little thing that
looks like a cigarette pack,


1014
00:46:43.385 --> 00:46:46.112
when he died, of a mysterious,
they said a heart attack.


1015
00:46:46.112 --> 00:46:48.494
It's all kinds of
evidence he was killed.


1016
00:46:49.737 --> 00:46:52.774
This is
real, usable power.


1017
00:46:52.774 --> 00:46:56.674
It's stable, it
is not transient,


1018
00:46:57.606 --> 00:46:59.885
it is not noise

1019
00:46:59.885 --> 00:47:03.681
and it is not any other
kind of spurious effect.


1020
00:47:03.681 --> 00:47:05.891
This is a real effect.

1021
00:47:05.891 --> 00:47:09.549
It's all coming from
that little, tiny box


1022
00:47:10.481 --> 00:47:16.902
sitting behind the 500 watts
of power behind the lamps.


1023
00:47:16.902 --> 00:47:21.907
That little box is putting
out all of that power


1024
00:47:23.356 --> 00:47:25.082
well over 500 watts

1025
00:47:26.152 --> 00:47:29.500
and yet it is
receiving less than 1/3


1026
00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.571
of a milliwatt of input power.

1027
00:47:33.194 --> 00:47:37.025
This is April the 30th, 1987,

1028
00:47:37.025 --> 00:47:41.305
at about 10:30 p.m. in the
home of Mr. Sparky Sweet,


1029
00:47:42.479 --> 00:47:47.208
the inventor of the
very first vacuum trial.


1030
00:47:47.208 --> 00:47:49.866
This is a most
historical occasion.


1031
00:47:49.866 --> 00:47:55.733
I was altered when I
saw it because my view


1032
00:47:55.733 --> 00:48:00.393
was that you could be
anywhere then in the universe.


1033
00:48:00.393 --> 00:48:02.395
You could be in a cave,
you could be anywhere,


1034
00:48:02.395 --> 00:48:04.950
and you had energy.

1035
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:09.817
This was overwhelming to
think that I could have energy


1036
00:48:09.817 --> 00:48:11.888
and the whole world
could have energy,


1037
00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:17.583
that all of a sudden we were
on equality economically.


1038
00:48:17.583 --> 00:48:22.381
We didn't have to worry
about the energy sources.


1039
00:48:23.175 --> 00:48:25.867
The rest of
that power is coming out


1040
00:48:25.867 --> 00:48:28.732
of the surging
energy of the vacuum.


1041
00:48:28.732 --> 00:48:33.219
And this little box that you
see right here, solid state,


1042
00:48:33.219 --> 00:48:37.603
no moving parts is
the vacuum triode


1043
00:48:37.603 --> 00:48:42.746
that's doing this very
practical and historical work.


1044
00:48:42.746 --> 00:48:45.059
He was shot at once
with a silence rifle


1045
00:48:45.059 --> 00:48:46.854
from about 300 yards.

1046
00:48:47.751 --> 00:48:49.201
The only thing saved his life

1047
00:48:49.201 --> 00:48:52.031
was he was an old
guy and very feeble.


1048
00:48:52.031 --> 00:48:54.585
He was stumbling as he coming
up the steps and he fell down.


1049
00:48:54.585 --> 00:48:56.139
He just flat fell
down on the steps,


1050
00:48:56.139 --> 00:48:57.485
caught his foot and
fell right forward.


1051
00:48:57.485 --> 00:48:58.762
And as his head went forward,

1052
00:48:58.762 --> 00:49:00.833
the bullet went right
by where his head was.


1053
00:49:00.833 --> 00:49:02.973
And of course the
assassin was never found.


1054
00:49:04.112 --> 00:49:05.873
This guy called me up, he
says, we really need your help.


1055
00:49:05.873 --> 00:49:08.013
And I said, the only
way you're gonna do this


1056
00:49:08.013 --> 00:49:12.293
is that you disclose it,
all of it, open source it.


1057
00:49:12.293 --> 00:49:13.466
Get it out there.

1058
00:49:13.466 --> 00:49:15.330
I will see that we get it out

1059
00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:16.987
to the entire
scientific community.


1060
00:49:16.987 --> 00:49:19.610
He says, no, no, no, Gollum.

1061
00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:21.543
My precious, my
precious, my precious.


1062
00:49:22.406 --> 00:49:23.580
And I said, dude,

1063
00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.616
you're you're gonna
take this to your grave.


1064
00:49:25.616 --> 00:49:28.516
He took it to his grave, yep.

1065
00:49:28.516 --> 00:49:29.689
It's gone.

1066
00:49:29.689 --> 00:49:33.624
This very distraught
lady who's Sparky's wife,


1067
00:49:33.624 --> 00:49:36.938
she's saying Sparky's dead.

1068
00:49:36.938 --> 00:49:40.459
And that she said
two strange men,


1069
00:49:40.459 --> 00:49:45.257
she called them strange men,
showed up at about five o'clock


1070
00:49:45.257 --> 00:49:50.089
the night before and they
stayed for a little while


1071
00:49:50.089 --> 00:49:51.297
and then they left.

1072
00:49:51.297 --> 00:49:57.476
And Sparky, an hour or two
later having a cup of coffee


1073
00:49:57.476 --> 00:50:02.688
and just keeled over onto the
floor, called the ambulance,


1074
00:50:02.688 --> 00:50:05.104
and she was 75 years old.

1075
00:50:05.104 --> 00:50:07.762
They would not let
her in the ambulance.


1076
00:50:07.762 --> 00:50:11.490
And the ambulance
then called her back


1077
00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:14.217
about 20 minutes later and said,

1078
00:50:14.217 --> 00:50:16.702
we don't think he's
going to make it.


1079
00:50:16.702 --> 00:50:22.121
And that was the end of
that until the next morning


1080
00:50:22.121 --> 00:50:26.884
when she called my sister-in-law
and talked to her and said,


1081
00:50:26.884 --> 00:50:31.544
"There are men here
that said they're FBI,


1082
00:50:31.544 --> 00:50:33.581
and they got black vans

1083
00:50:33.581 --> 00:50:36.998
and they're taking all this
equipment, what should I do?"


1084
00:50:48.009 --> 00:50:49.873
Good afternoon and
welcome to this edition


1085
00:50:49.873 --> 00:50:51.047
of Eyewitness Newsmakers.

1086
00:50:51.047 --> 00:50:52.565
I'm your host, Doug Miller.

1087
00:50:52.565 --> 00:50:55.361
On March the 23rd,
chemist Stanley Ponds


1088
00:50:55.361 --> 00:50:58.192
and Martin Fleischman
rocked the world of science.


1089
00:50:58.192 --> 00:51:00.297
They announced that they
had achieved coal fusion


1090
00:51:00.297 --> 00:51:02.817
in their laboratory at
the University of Utah.


1091
00:51:02.817 --> 00:51:05.889
The promise of a cheap and
a plentiful energy supply


1092
00:51:05.889 --> 00:51:07.753
grabbed the world's attention.

1093
00:51:07.753 --> 00:51:09.203
It did put out a lot of power.

1094
00:51:09.203 --> 00:51:12.861
But what was scary
is that this is 1989,


1095
00:51:12.861 --> 00:51:15.519
it made the cover of
all the magazines.


1096
00:51:15.519 --> 00:51:18.695
The way they took that
avenue of discovery


1097
00:51:18.695 --> 00:51:20.524
out of the scientific world

1098
00:51:20.524 --> 00:51:22.699
is that there were
people who were paid,


1099
00:51:22.699 --> 00:51:27.393
who were corrupted through
scientific fraud at MIT.


1100
00:51:27.393 --> 00:51:28.325
Next slide.

1101
00:51:29.499 --> 00:51:30.776
Dr. Eugene Mallove,

1102
00:51:30.776 --> 00:51:33.675
dear friend of mine,
PhD, Harvard and MIT.


1103
00:51:33.675 --> 00:51:34.883
Brilliant man.

1104
00:51:34.883 --> 00:51:36.299
There was a man
named Eugene Mallove,


1105
00:51:36.299 --> 00:51:38.956
who it's quite possible

1106
00:51:38.956 --> 00:51:41.925
was eliminated by
the powers that be


1107
00:51:41.925 --> 00:51:43.340
in the fossil fuel industry.

1108
00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.962
He died in 2004.

1109
00:51:44.962 --> 00:51:47.310
He was murdered that year.

1110
00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:50.313
But Mallove was an
extremely important figure


1111
00:51:50.313 --> 00:51:52.660
in the alternative energy world,

1112
00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:56.043
especially in terms of
what's called cold fusion.


1113
00:51:56.043 --> 00:51:58.286
And he was at MIT,

1114
00:51:58.286 --> 00:52:00.840
in the science
office for education.


1115
00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.223
When he saw how they
had changed the data


1116
00:52:04.223 --> 00:52:07.916
on the reproducing the
Pons Fleischmann experiment


1117
00:52:07.916 --> 00:52:09.125
and he blew the whistle.

1118
00:52:10.574 --> 00:52:13.336
I inadvertently was
looking through some piles


1119
00:52:13.336 --> 00:52:15.338
of paper that had
been given to me


1120
00:52:15.338 --> 00:52:18.168
in a casual manner by all
these hot fusion physicists


1121
00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:22.069
as they were trying to do
their colormetric repeat


1122
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:24.209
of the Pons
Fleischmann experiment.


1123
00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:27.074
And to my utter astonishment,

1124
00:52:27.074 --> 00:52:30.387
I can remember sitting
at my desk in my study


1125
00:52:30.387 --> 00:52:33.390
and actually seeing these
two sheets of paper,


1126
00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:36.842
the one dated July 10th, 1989

1127
00:52:36.842 --> 00:52:40.017
and another dated July

1128
00:52:40.811 --> 00:52:44.021
The difference between July

1129
00:52:44.021 --> 00:52:46.714
And I was stunned, I couldn't
believe what I was seeing.


1130
00:52:46.714 --> 00:52:49.337
It looked like monkey
business to me at the time.


1131
00:52:49.337 --> 00:52:51.408
And it has turned out
to be exactly that.


1132
00:52:51.408 --> 00:52:53.997
It was a lower echelon person

1133
00:52:53.997 --> 00:52:56.379
in the plasma fusion
center at MIT,


1134
00:52:56.379 --> 00:52:58.726
one of the 16 authors
of a scientific paper


1135
00:52:58.726 --> 00:53:00.521
done under Department
of Energy contract


1136
00:53:00.521 --> 00:53:01.694
that had altered data.

1137
00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:05.905
And that data is scientific
fraud as far as I'm concerned.


1138
00:53:05.905 --> 00:53:07.700
And many other
people are concerned.


1139
00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.600
And it was hell on wheels.

1140
00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:15.950
Finally gets someone who
brings him a zero point device,


1141
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.504
solid state, no moving parts.

1142
00:53:18.504 --> 00:53:20.403
And I said, Eugene,

1143
00:53:20.403 --> 00:53:23.544
we need to get this out to
the public very quickly.


1144
00:53:23.544 --> 00:53:26.133
Oh no, they wanna
keep it secret.


1145
00:53:26.133 --> 00:53:27.375
I begged him and I begged him

1146
00:53:27.375 --> 00:53:29.101
and I begged him
and I begged him.


1147
00:53:30.861 --> 00:53:34.762
He was beaten to death when he
was over at his parents' home


1148
00:53:34.762 --> 00:53:38.041
and was killed, murdered,
made to look like some thugs.


1149
00:53:38.041 --> 00:53:42.218
Yeah, they were thugs but
it wasn't a random murder


1150
00:53:42.218 --> 00:53:45.566
and the device
vanished with him.


1151
00:53:45.566 --> 00:53:47.706
Good friend of
mine, dear friend.


1152
00:53:47.706 --> 00:53:49.535
What we really
had was a threat


1153
00:53:49.535 --> 00:53:51.572
to the scientific establishment,

1154
00:53:51.572 --> 00:53:55.092
the threat of it even
being implied as real


1155
00:53:55.092 --> 00:53:57.233
and having monies, shall we say

1156
00:53:57.233 --> 00:54:00.615
being diverted from
their favored programs.


1157
00:54:00.615 --> 00:54:03.273
And that was a
threat, no question.


1158
00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:05.448
It was an actual threat
of that happening.


1159
00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:13.145
US scientists making
a huge breakthrough.


1160
00:54:13.145 --> 00:54:15.596
A source tells CNN that
for the first time ever,


1161
00:54:15.596 --> 00:54:17.632
researchers have been
able to create energy


1162
00:54:17.632 --> 00:54:19.979
from a fusion reaction.

1163
00:54:19.979 --> 00:54:22.534
Now Laura, I could explain
all of this in great detail,


1164
00:54:23.466 --> 00:54:26.123
but basically it's a giant step

1165
00:54:26.123 --> 00:54:27.884
towards a clean energy future

1166
00:54:27.884 --> 00:54:30.473
without dependence
on fossil fuels.


1167
00:54:30.473 --> 00:54:32.785
This is the first
time, by all accounts,


1168
00:54:32.785 --> 00:54:36.824
they've gotten more heat
out than they put in.


1169
00:54:36.824 --> 00:54:38.826
Not so fast.

1170
00:54:38.826 --> 00:54:40.621
This supposed breakthrough

1171
00:54:40.621 --> 00:54:43.002
announced just as we
were finishing this film


1172
00:54:43.002 --> 00:54:45.281
is a total distraction.

1173
00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:48.732
The net gain, .1 kilowatt
is enough to boil


1174
00:54:48.732 --> 00:54:51.632
a kettle of water
and not much else.


1175
00:54:51.632 --> 00:54:54.945
But what is truly baffling
is that they are not counting


1176
00:54:54.945 --> 00:54:57.431
the actual input required
to power the lasers


1177
00:54:57.431 --> 00:54:59.709
to get the machine going.

1178
00:54:59.709 --> 00:55:01.297
When you count
the energy it took


1179
00:55:01.297 --> 00:55:03.644
to generate the fusion reaction,

1180
00:55:03.644 --> 00:55:06.923
it's actually a

1181
00:55:08.269 --> 00:55:11.376
Furthermore, fusion
reactions can generate heat


1182
00:55:11.376 --> 00:55:14.379
in excess of three
million degrees,


1183
00:55:14.379 --> 00:55:15.897
which would ignite the oxygen

1184
00:55:15.897 --> 00:55:18.590
in the surrounding air if
a breach ever occurred.


1185
00:55:19.280 --> 00:55:24.527
Everything about this is at
best wrong, at worst fraudulent.


1186
00:55:25.735 --> 00:55:28.047
So why is this fake
solution being pushed


1187
00:55:28.047 --> 00:55:30.498
by every media
outlet on the planet


1188
00:55:30.498 --> 00:55:32.535
when we have had
real solutions hidden


1189
00:55:32.535 --> 00:55:35.779
in classified programs
for 100 years?


1190
00:55:37.194 --> 00:55:39.162
Different people
have different devices.


1191
00:55:39.162 --> 00:55:41.440
Of the ones that have promise,

1192
00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:45.306
there's certain themes
that keep reemerging.


1193
00:55:45.306 --> 00:55:48.171
The first theme is
torsion physics.


1194
00:55:48.171 --> 00:55:50.932
Torsion physics is a
fancy way of saying


1195
00:55:50.932 --> 00:55:52.727
something that spins like this

1196
00:55:52.727 --> 00:55:54.902
and something that
spins like this,


1197
00:55:54.902 --> 00:55:57.076
think of it as like
an hourglass shape.


1198
00:55:57.076 --> 00:56:00.425
I think that it has to
do with it representing


1199
00:56:00.425 --> 00:56:02.806
the way energy moves
in the universe.


1200
00:56:02.806 --> 00:56:06.327
At the biggest levels like
the galaxy, it's a spiral.


1201
00:56:06.327 --> 00:56:09.779
A tornado on Earth is
this vortex motion.


1202
00:56:09.779 --> 00:56:13.265
Our DNA is a stranded spiral.

1203
00:56:13.265 --> 00:56:18.270
A second theme is plasma, a
lightning bolt is plasma, right?


1204
00:56:19.167 --> 00:56:21.894
The spark gap in
a car is plasma.


1205
00:56:21.894 --> 00:56:25.450
So plasma is the
fourth state of matter.


1206
00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:27.900
Solid water is ice,
add more energy,


1207
00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:31.904
it melts and becomes
water, add more energy,


1208
00:56:31.904 --> 00:56:34.010
it becomes steam.

1209
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:36.219
And then if you were to
add even more energy,


1210
00:56:36.219 --> 00:56:39.636
say through running an electric
current through that steam


1211
00:56:39.636 --> 00:56:42.398
or through any gas,
you end up with plasma.


1212
00:56:42.398 --> 00:56:45.193
You can think of it as
maybe this liminal state


1213
00:56:45.193 --> 00:56:46.747
or in between state,

1214
00:56:46.747 --> 00:56:49.301
between the physical world
and the nonphysical world.


1215
00:56:49.301 --> 00:56:50.233
Whatever that is.

1216
00:56:50.233 --> 00:56:51.890
There's some evidence emerging

1217
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:57.827
that plasma can provide
a shielding of inertia.


1218
00:56:57.827 --> 00:57:00.208
So if you imagine
that you're a UFO


1219
00:57:00.208 --> 00:57:03.591
and you need to zip
around at crazy speeds,


1220
00:57:03.591 --> 00:57:05.697
you can't pump the
brakes too fast,


1221
00:57:05.697 --> 00:57:07.388
otherwise everyone's
going to slam


1222
00:57:07.388 --> 00:57:09.217
into the windshield, right?

1223
00:57:09.217 --> 00:57:11.806
But if you had some
sort of inertial shield


1224
00:57:11.806 --> 00:57:15.085
around the craft, i.e.,
like a plasma shield,


1225
00:57:15.085 --> 00:57:18.399
you might be able to
eliminate the inertia


1226
00:57:18.399 --> 00:57:20.988
surrounding that and
keep the occupants safe.


1227
00:57:20.988 --> 00:57:25.993
I think this is why the UFOs
seem to glow, plasma glows.


1228
00:57:27.201 --> 00:57:30.238
A third theme is
that of the ether,


1229
00:57:30.238 --> 00:57:32.344
the conventional or
mainstream understanding


1230
00:57:32.344 --> 00:57:34.933
of the base level of reality

1231
00:57:34.933 --> 00:57:37.280
is maybe the quantum,
tiniest particles


1232
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.316
all bumping into each other.

1233
00:57:39.316 --> 00:57:41.388
The ether conceives
of this differently,


1234
00:57:41.388 --> 00:57:45.150
it says that there's a
kind of a fluid geometry


1235
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:47.394
that is the base layer
of physical reality.


1236
00:57:47.394 --> 00:57:50.189
And that to understand
that fluid geometry


1237
00:57:50.189 --> 00:57:54.435
is to be able to really
understand electricity,


1238
00:57:54.435 --> 00:57:56.610
magnetism and gravity.

1239
00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:59.923
And this, according to
Tesla and others, is the key


1240
00:57:59.923 --> 00:58:01.200
to really understanding

1241
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.651
what he was getting
at with all of his


1242
00:58:03.651 --> 00:58:06.033
wireless transmission
of energy stuff.


1243
00:58:06.033 --> 00:58:08.553
But I believe that we're
going to see something


1244
00:58:08.553 --> 00:58:12.142
like a return of the ether,
it won't be called that,


1245
00:58:12.142 --> 00:58:16.146
but it'll be something like
that that's going to enable us


1246
00:58:16.146 --> 00:58:19.287
to make much more
progress in these areas


1247
00:58:19.287 --> 00:58:20.565
in the coming century.

1248
00:58:23.706 --> 00:58:25.259
This gentleman, he had a car

1249
00:58:25.259 --> 00:58:30.160
that would run on water
but it had to be modified.


1250
00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:32.922
A local inventor has
discovered a way, hear this,


1251
00:58:32.922 --> 00:58:35.131
to use water to run your car.

1252
00:58:35.131 --> 00:58:36.546
It's a major breakthrough

1253
00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:38.410
that will no doubt
make motorists happy.


1254
00:58:38.410 --> 00:58:39.998
And as Ralph Robinson explains,

1255
00:58:39.998 --> 00:58:41.448
the Pentagon is also showing

1256
00:58:41.448 --> 00:58:43.829
lots of interest
in this project.


1257
00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:46.038
And he always
kept that secret.


1258
00:58:46.038 --> 00:58:49.041
He had a patent that he
falsified the voltage


1259
00:58:49.041 --> 00:58:51.837
and the frequency
cycles per second


1260
00:58:51.837 --> 00:58:54.115
because he didn't want
anyone to reproduce it


1261
00:58:54.115 --> 00:58:57.118
and leapfrog him
financially, again,


1262
00:58:57.118 --> 00:58:59.327
this crazy inventor syndrome.

1263
00:58:59.327 --> 00:59:02.814
And what happened, and
when he passed away,


1264
00:59:02.814 --> 00:59:07.543
there was a whole warehouse
full of floppy disks and papers


1265
00:59:07.543 --> 00:59:11.650
and everything and his
heirs wanted to sell it off.


1266
00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:15.240
What people didn't
realize is that this car


1267
00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:19.382
was the least important
thing Stan Meyer had.


1268
00:59:19.382 --> 00:59:22.834
He had a Toroid and the Toroid

1269
00:59:22.834 --> 00:59:25.284
it was a donut shaped
electromagnetic device


1270
00:59:25.284 --> 00:59:28.564
that had had a national
security order slapped on it.


1271
00:59:28.564 --> 00:59:32.878
'Cause I was gonna get it
and openly disclose it.


1272
00:59:34.673 --> 00:59:36.433
The other
scientific establishment


1273
00:59:36.433 --> 00:59:38.505
may have ignored
the likes of Meyer,


1274
00:59:38.505 --> 00:59:41.853
a powerful military industrial
complex certainly hasn't,


1275
00:59:41.853 --> 00:59:43.579
over the past 10 years,

1276
00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:45.650
Meyer says he's been
quietly approached


1277
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:47.652
by many influential organizations

1278
00:59:47.652 --> 00:59:49.412
who would never admit publicly

1279
00:59:49.412 --> 00:59:50.931
to their involvement with him.

1280
00:59:52.449 --> 00:59:54.313
This was a disaster.

1281
00:59:54.313 --> 00:59:57.006
If we had a few hundred
thousand we were gonna offer,


1282
00:59:57.006 --> 00:59:59.215
but we made it clear we
were gonna open source it.


1283
00:59:59.215 --> 01:00:01.735
Well they had a group
an engineering group


1284
01:00:01.735 --> 01:00:04.151
from Michigan come in
who had a lot more money


1285
01:00:04.151 --> 01:00:05.773
'cause they had a big backer

1286
01:00:05.773 --> 01:00:08.293
and they were gonna
monetize it, keep it secret,


1287
01:00:08.293 --> 01:00:09.812
try to repatent it,

1288
01:00:09.812 --> 01:00:13.263
all the usual crazy ideas
and which would be great


1289
01:00:13.263 --> 01:00:15.990
if you're just developing
a new software program,


1290
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:18.890
but not something that's gonna
change the world forever.


1291
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:20.201
Can't do it.

1292
01:00:20.201 --> 01:00:21.133
They were working
on a couple years,


1293
01:00:21.133 --> 01:00:23.757
I get this hysterical call.

1294
01:00:23.757 --> 01:00:25.413
"Dr. Greer, we need your help.

1295
01:00:25.413 --> 01:00:26.656
We need your help."

1296
01:00:26.656 --> 01:00:28.969
He says they're on the
run for their lives.


1297
01:00:28.969 --> 01:00:32.006
They've been sabotaged,
they've had death threats.


1298
01:00:32.006 --> 01:00:33.905
And my advice was,

1299
01:00:33.905 --> 01:00:37.218
forget about Gollum and being
my ring and my precious ring.


1300
01:00:37.218 --> 01:00:40.083
In this case, it was
literally a precious ring.


1301
01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:43.466
Just put it out there.
I will help spread it.


1302
01:00:43.466 --> 01:00:45.468
We will build these
up independently.


1303
01:00:45.468 --> 01:00:49.955
Have labs tested and you
cannot put that toothpaste


1304
01:00:49.955 --> 01:00:52.648
back in the tube, you
squeeze it hard enough.


1305
01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:54.028
He says, yes, you're right.

1306
01:00:54.028 --> 01:00:55.202
It's probably the only way,

1307
01:00:55.202 --> 01:00:57.618
but they think they can find
a safe country to go to.


1308
01:00:59.171 --> 01:01:01.001
I said, you're gonna have to
go to another star system,


1309
01:01:01.001 --> 01:01:03.072
my friend, I
literally said that,


1310
01:01:03.072 --> 01:01:05.246
no way that's gonna happen.

1311
01:01:05.246 --> 01:01:07.801
So sure enough, I find
out a few months later,


1312
01:01:07.801 --> 01:01:09.837
I'm meeting with a high
tech guy in Orange County.


1313
01:01:09.837 --> 01:01:13.807
That entire team was
assassinated, the one survived.


1314
01:01:13.807 --> 01:01:16.672
Was just crying like a
baby in this man's office.


1315
01:01:16.672 --> 01:01:18.777
Technology shows that
we can release energy


1316
01:01:18.777 --> 01:01:22.505
up to beyond 2.5
million barrels of oil


1317
01:01:22.505 --> 01:01:25.059
per gallon of water
and do it safely.


1318
01:01:25.059 --> 01:01:29.270
So it gives us the ability to
not only sustain and maintain


1319
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:30.547
the economies of the world,

1320
01:01:30.547 --> 01:01:33.585
but also give us the
abilities to handle


1321
01:01:33.585 --> 01:01:36.692
the environmental pollution
problems at the same time.


1322
01:01:36.692 --> 01:01:38.901
This sort of encapsulates,

1323
01:01:38.901 --> 01:01:42.525
five or 10 of the
suppression techniques,


1324
01:01:42.525 --> 01:01:45.908
all the way from murder to
crazy inventor syndrome,


1325
01:01:45.908 --> 01:01:47.772
falsifying your patent,

1326
01:01:47.772 --> 01:01:49.290
trying to make money first

1327
01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:52.535
instead of proving the
science first, et cetera.


1328
01:01:52.535 --> 01:01:55.987
And of course he took
this to his grave.


1329
01:01:55.987 --> 01:01:59.128
He was poisoned and killed
at a Cracker Barrel,


1330
01:01:59.128 --> 01:02:01.440
an ignominious death,
if everybody heard one.


1331
01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:04.996
Stan
Meyer's water engine


1332
01:02:04.996 --> 01:02:06.583
points us to a deeper mystery

1333
01:02:06.583 --> 01:02:09.034
concerning energy
in our universe.


1334
01:02:09.034 --> 01:02:11.416
Microscopic ball lightning.

1335
01:02:11.416 --> 01:02:14.799
The late physicist Ken
Shoulders developed a technology


1336
01:02:14.799 --> 01:02:19.182
called charge clusters, which
are likened to ball lightning.


1337
01:02:19.182 --> 01:02:20.701
When they are discharged,

1338
01:02:20.701 --> 01:02:24.187
they actually tap into the
zero point energy field.


1339
01:02:24.187 --> 01:02:25.741
This is where most of the power

1340
01:02:25.741 --> 01:02:28.847
in Stan Meyer's device
was coming from.


1341
01:02:28.847 --> 01:02:32.506
Like Stan, Ken Shoulders
faced terrible suppression.


1342
01:02:33.852 --> 01:02:36.717
And so I met with this
CEO and he says, yes,


1343
01:02:36.717 --> 01:02:39.755
they approved a $5
million grant from DOE,


1344
01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:41.377
so we could develop
this further.


1345
01:02:41.377 --> 01:02:43.586
'Cause one of the effects it had

1346
01:02:43.586 --> 01:02:45.105
that they were really pursuing

1347
01:02:45.105 --> 01:02:49.005
was putting low level
initially radioactive waste


1348
01:02:49.005 --> 01:02:51.698
in these charge clusters.

1349
01:02:51.698 --> 01:02:55.702
And it would cause isotopes
that were non-radioactive


1350
01:02:55.702 --> 01:02:57.186
to be created.

1351
01:02:57.186 --> 01:02:58.463
What does this mean?

1352
01:02:58.463 --> 01:03:00.845
We clean up all the
radioactive waste.


1353
01:03:00.845 --> 01:03:02.847
However, the phenomenon,

1354
01:03:02.847 --> 01:03:04.124
the reason it was doing it

1355
01:03:04.124 --> 01:03:06.713
was that it was actually
activating, as it were,


1356
01:03:06.713 --> 01:03:10.164
this baseline energy field
that's set the fabric of space


1357
01:03:10.164 --> 01:03:12.788
and time and that's what
they didn't want out.


1358
01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:17.447
So in the rarest of events,
that grant was published


1359
01:03:17.447 --> 01:03:20.416
and these vicious people

1360
01:03:20.416 --> 01:03:21.935
who wanna keep all
this stuff secret


1361
01:03:21.935 --> 01:03:26.974
went into the Secretary of
Energies office and said,


1362
01:03:27.423 --> 01:03:30.081
pull that grant,
and they pulled it.


1363
01:03:31.979 --> 01:03:34.050
Another
technology to harness the power


1364
01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:35.534
of ball lightning

1365
01:03:35.534 --> 01:03:38.434
is being developed by a team
of engineers in Florida.


1366
01:03:38.434 --> 01:03:41.368
They have successfully
tested several prototypes


1367
01:03:41.368 --> 01:03:44.095
that allow any internal
combustion engine


1368
01:03:44.095 --> 01:03:45.821
to run mostly on water.

1369
01:03:55.727 --> 01:03:57.315
It's a little quicker, huh?

1370
01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:03.355
This is a phenomenal
system patented,


1371
01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.600
but it runs internal
combustion engines on water


1372
01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.776
with a little bit
of gasoline in it


1373
01:04:09.776 --> 01:04:12.744
so you don't have to modify
the engine, it won't rust.


1374
01:04:12.744 --> 01:04:15.471
What this means is
with Stan Meyer,


1375
01:04:15.471 --> 01:04:17.887
you really had to have a
different kind of engine


1376
01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.578
and spark plug and all that,

1377
01:04:19.578 --> 01:04:21.857
this conventional spark
plug engine, all of it,


1378
01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:24.791
'cause it has enough of
the lubricant oil in it


1379
01:04:24.791 --> 01:04:27.241
that it won't just
freeze up the engine.


1380
01:04:27.241 --> 01:04:29.278
And this is literally
what he's doing.


1381
01:04:29.278 --> 01:04:31.452
Stan Meyer, this device

1382
01:04:31.452 --> 01:04:35.422
and many of the others, Ken
Shoulders charge clusters,


1383
01:04:35.422 --> 01:04:38.805
they're creating these small
microscopic ball lightnings


1384
01:04:38.805 --> 01:04:41.877
that when they
discharge, are tapping


1385
01:04:41.877 --> 01:04:43.740
into that zero
point energy field


1386
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:46.605
and creating the mode of force.

1387
01:04:46.605 --> 01:04:48.366
Boom, that's
why the concussion


1388
01:04:48.366 --> 01:04:50.333
from the thunder
clap is so huge.


1389
01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:53.302
There's a huge amount of energy
and it's actually sourced


1390
01:04:53.302 --> 01:04:56.615
from the vacuum energy,
all the dots connected.


1391
01:04:56.615 --> 01:04:58.307
This is what's happening, right?

1392
01:04:58.307 --> 01:05:01.448
So we need to make the
thunder clap engine.


1393
01:05:01.448 --> 01:05:04.175
Many times breakthroughs
are made because the inventor


1394
01:05:04.175 --> 01:05:08.075
or the scientist was inspired
by looking at nature.


1395
01:05:08.075 --> 01:05:10.215
The same systems and
the same mechanisms


1396
01:05:10.215 --> 01:05:12.459
that exist in nature
that you can see


1397
01:05:12.459 --> 01:05:16.773
can also exist in the
devices that you build.


1398
01:05:16.773 --> 01:05:19.569
So by trying to mimic that,

1399
01:05:19.569 --> 01:05:22.193
you can can tap into
the intelligence


1400
01:05:22.193 --> 01:05:24.505
that nature has
already shown you


1401
01:05:24.505 --> 01:05:26.266
when it comes to being efficient

1402
01:05:26.266 --> 01:05:28.475
with the energy
transmission mechanisms.


1403
01:05:31.167 --> 01:05:32.997
Another
current technology


1404
01:05:32.997 --> 01:05:35.551
was recently
investigated by Dr. Greer


1405
01:05:35.551 --> 01:05:39.244
and his engineering team
at an undisclosed location


1406
01:05:39.244 --> 01:05:41.419
in the Arizona Desert.

1407
01:05:41.419 --> 01:05:45.009
One, two, three, four,
five, six magnesium alloy,


1408
01:05:45.009 --> 01:05:47.080
specially configured plates.

1409
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.566
This thing's the size
of a nice size shoebox.


1410
01:05:50.566 --> 01:05:53.741
The circuitry you see on
the right is a misdirect


1411
01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.054
'cause the guy has
crazy inventor syndrome


1412
01:05:56.054 --> 01:05:57.745
and thinks he can keep it secret

1413
01:05:57.745 --> 01:06:00.024
and make a trillion dollars.

1414
01:06:01.335 --> 01:06:03.061
You don't interfere

1415
01:06:03.061 --> 01:06:04.994
with the big powerful people.

1416
01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:06.823
You don't put them
outta business.


1417
01:06:06.823 --> 01:06:08.101
They're still in business.

1418
01:06:08.101 --> 01:06:11.311
They still have those 50
year leases on the lines


1419
01:06:11.311 --> 01:06:14.797
and all the power transformers.

1420
01:06:14.797 --> 01:06:18.145
You'd be able to get
one of my power plants


1421
01:06:18.145 --> 01:06:21.390
just replace a coal
fire plant, you know?


1422
01:06:22.598 --> 01:06:24.531
But it wouldn't be
big news or anything


1423
01:06:24.531 --> 01:06:27.430
'cause I'm just selling
electricity to them, okay?


1424
01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:29.087
And then they're gonna say, wow,

1425
01:06:29.087 --> 01:06:30.882
we're making more
money at this plant


1426
01:06:30.882 --> 01:06:31.883
than we are the others.

1427
01:06:31.883 --> 01:06:33.471
So they're gonna
put them around,


1428
01:06:33.471 --> 01:06:36.301
you see, they're
not gonna let me in.


1429
01:06:36.301 --> 01:06:40.098
They're gonna fight
me tooth and nail,


1430
01:06:40.098 --> 01:06:42.929
I'm gonna be very
sneaky about it.


1431
01:06:45.241 --> 01:06:46.898
This thing for three years

1432
01:06:46.898 --> 01:06:49.866
have been sitting in
this near chicken coop


1433
01:06:49.866 --> 01:06:51.868
in his backyard
out in the desert,


1434
01:06:51.868 --> 01:06:55.320
putting out three kilowatts
of power continuously.


1435
01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.633
And we cranked it up
to five kilowatts,


1436
01:06:57.633 --> 01:07:03.501
no input power and is
running off the magnetic flux


1437
01:07:03.501 --> 01:07:05.399
of the space around it

1438
01:07:05.399 --> 01:07:08.126
that he can tune any place
on the Earth so it's correct.


1439
01:07:08.126 --> 01:07:10.473
And boom, this
thing solid state,


1440
01:07:10.473 --> 01:07:12.579
no moving parts,
we just saw this,


1441
01:07:12.579 --> 01:07:18.481
but he's a textbook case of
making every wrong decision.


1442
01:07:18.481 --> 01:07:19.758
Tried to patent it.

1443
01:07:19.758 --> 01:07:21.657
Well you'll see in a
moment what happened.


1444
01:07:21.657 --> 01:07:25.488
He ended up getting put
in prison for a week.


1445
01:07:25.488 --> 01:07:28.975
He has had sabotage,
death threats,


1446
01:07:28.975 --> 01:07:31.253
murder of people around him.

1447
01:07:32.426 --> 01:07:35.153
I spent
eight days in that jail,


1448
01:07:35.153 --> 01:07:38.363
when I went before the
court judge come here,


1449
01:07:39.882 --> 01:07:42.091
he says, "Read
this, you sign it,


1450
01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:45.474
you go home, you don't
sign it, you go to jail."


1451
01:07:46.958 --> 01:07:50.651
And all it was is I would
not ever in my lifetime,


1452
01:07:50.651 --> 01:07:54.241
ever, through me or anyone else,

1453
01:07:54.241 --> 01:07:58.211
if anybody else is manufacturing
these, I'll go to jail.


1454
01:07:59.384 --> 01:08:01.766
And here's the secrecy
order he was slapped with.


1455
01:08:01.766 --> 01:08:03.768
But look at the date.

1456
01:08:05.425 --> 01:08:09.636
1984, it was almost

1457
01:08:09.636 --> 01:08:11.189
So you know, doing
the same thing.


1458
01:08:11.189 --> 01:08:13.019
Patent office, people
think this is a myth.


1459
01:08:13.019 --> 01:08:14.399
Now here's a secrecy order.

1460
01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:17.851
See, so I don't
want to go through that again.


1461
01:08:17.851 --> 01:08:21.303
Scared my family and everybody.

1462
01:08:21.303 --> 01:08:25.514
So now what we're gonna
do, gonna be very quiet.


1463
01:08:25.514 --> 01:08:27.550
I'm gonna build my one megawatt.

1464
01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:30.174
It'll take two and
half years to build it.


1465
01:08:31.623 --> 01:08:36.007
It's very complicated, I gotta
acclimate it to the Earth.


1466
01:08:39.424 --> 01:08:41.012
Technologies like this

1467
01:08:41.012 --> 01:08:42.841
and countless others
will never see


1468
01:08:42.841 --> 01:08:46.362
the light of day without
a radically new strategy.


1469
01:08:46.362 --> 01:08:49.710
Dr. Greer is preparing to
launch a multi-centered


1470
01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:53.059
state-of-the-art research
and development lab


1471
01:08:53.059 --> 01:08:56.510
that will develop zero
point energy technology


1472
01:08:56.510 --> 01:09:00.997
live streaming 24/7 for
security and transparency.


1473
01:09:00.997 --> 01:09:02.482
All research results,

1474
01:09:02.482 --> 01:09:06.279
data and plans would be released
to the world open source,


1475
01:09:06.279 --> 01:09:09.661
freely available to the public
and the scientific community.


1476
01:09:10.869 --> 01:09:13.355
This will require
broad public support


1477
01:09:13.355 --> 01:09:15.529
to make this a reality.

1478
01:09:15.529 --> 01:09:16.979
With this strategy,

1479
01:09:16.979 --> 01:09:20.086
zero point energy is achievable,

1480
01:09:20.086 --> 01:09:23.365
but it is only half of
what has been suppressed.


1481
01:09:25.643 --> 01:09:28.059
Now we get into the
really cool stuff.


1482
01:09:28.059 --> 01:09:29.405
Look at the dates.

1483
01:09:29.405 --> 01:09:32.788
1919, Pat Kowsky
Frost experiment


1484
01:09:32.788 --> 01:09:35.894
where they actually had
high frequency systems


1485
01:09:35.894 --> 01:09:40.623
where things levitated,
defying gravity


1486
01:09:40.623 --> 01:09:42.763
and then T. Townsend Brown.

1487
01:09:42.763 --> 01:09:45.421
And he had very high
voltage systems,


1488
01:09:45.421 --> 01:09:47.320
electrogravidic they call it,

1489
01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:51.531
where high voltage would
cause this lift effect


1490
01:09:51.531 --> 01:09:55.224
and would actually create,
if you will, a bubble,


1491
01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:58.848
an electromagnetic field
that would allow an object


1492
01:09:58.848 --> 01:10:00.850
to move at enormous speeds

1493
01:10:00.850 --> 01:10:02.887
and free of the
forces of gravity.


1494
01:10:02.887 --> 01:10:05.027
What's called gravity control.

1495
01:10:06.201 --> 01:10:08.272
An Office
of Naval Research report


1496
01:10:08.272 --> 01:10:11.447
on T. Townsend Brown's
electro gravity device


1497
01:10:11.447 --> 01:10:13.898
includes a transcript
of a conversation


1498
01:10:13.898 --> 01:10:16.866
between Major General
VE Bartrandias


1499
01:10:16.866 --> 01:10:20.111
and Lieutenant General HA Craig.

1500
01:10:20.111 --> 01:10:23.977
Bartrandias remarks, "It
sounds terribly screwy.


1501
01:10:23.977 --> 01:10:25.806
But Friday I went
down to a place


1502
01:10:25.806 --> 01:10:28.119
called the Townsend
Brown Foundation,


1503
01:10:28.119 --> 01:10:29.396
and believe it or not,

1504
01:10:29.396 --> 01:10:31.778
I saw a model of
a flying saucer."


1505
01:10:33.193 --> 01:10:35.540
Townsend Brown was an
independent experimenter


1506
01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:39.199
and he actually worked
on, as you can see,


1507
01:10:39.199 --> 01:10:43.341
very large replications of
saucers that he believed


1508
01:10:43.341 --> 01:10:46.862
were vital for a different
type of propulsion.


1509
01:10:46.862 --> 01:10:49.692
The big question
is, can I prove this?


1510
01:10:49.692 --> 01:10:54.041
This I consider to be a
very serious Rosetta Stone.


1511
01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:56.423
This is Young Men magazine,

1512
01:10:56.423 --> 01:10:59.461
the article's titled the
G-Engines are Coming,


1513
01:10:59.461 --> 01:11:03.223
by far the most potent
source of energy is gravity.


1514
01:11:03.223 --> 01:11:05.743
Using it as power
future aircraft


1515
01:11:05.743 --> 01:11:07.676
will attain the speed of light.

1516
01:11:07.676 --> 01:11:10.403
Now in this article,
they give you the names,


1517
01:11:10.403 --> 01:11:13.164
they give you the timeframe,
they give you the dates,


1518
01:11:13.164 --> 01:11:15.235
they give you the
defense contractors,


1519
01:11:15.235 --> 01:11:17.064
universities and
research centers


1520
01:11:17.064 --> 01:11:21.310
that are actively pursuing
cracking the gravity barrier.


1521
01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.416
They talk about the
Lear Corporation,


1522
01:11:23.416 --> 01:11:26.626
the Sperry Rand corporation,
the Bell Aircraft Corporation,


1523
01:11:26.626 --> 01:11:30.802
all trying desperately to
crack the gravity barrier.


1524
01:11:30.802 --> 01:11:32.908
And it's clear from the
eyewitness testimony


1525
01:11:32.908 --> 01:11:34.427
they've done it.

1526
01:11:34.427 --> 01:11:36.946
And then we have Michael
Strat to thank for this,


1527
01:11:36.946 --> 01:11:38.396
great archivist and historian,

1528
01:11:38.396 --> 01:11:41.606
and he's found these journals
that date from the '50s,


1529
01:11:41.606 --> 01:11:46.577
one, 1956 where the big buzz
in the aerospace industry


1530
01:11:46.577 --> 01:11:48.993
was anti-gravity, quote unquote,

1531
01:11:48.993 --> 01:11:51.237
the G engines, gravity engines.

1532
01:11:51.237 --> 01:11:53.791
And this was actually
in the open literature


1533
01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:56.069
until they figured out
how it really works


1534
01:11:56.069 --> 01:11:57.553
and it all went black.

1535
01:11:57.553 --> 01:12:00.694
Now, where did they
get the technology?


1536
01:12:00.694 --> 01:12:04.871
This was an interesting
crash retrieval.


1537
01:12:04.871 --> 01:12:08.840
This is prior to Roswell,
this is November, 1946.


1538
01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.567
This was seen by a courier

1539
01:12:11.567 --> 01:12:13.776
who went to Wright
Patterson Air Force Base


1540
01:12:13.776 --> 01:12:18.056
and he had a guard, an MP
who he was friends with.


1541
01:12:18.056 --> 01:12:19.713
And this guard said,
"You know what,


1542
01:12:19.713 --> 01:12:21.059
I got something I
wanna show you."


1543
01:12:21.059 --> 01:12:22.958
So he brought him
into this facility


1544
01:12:22.958 --> 01:12:24.304
at Wright Patterson
Air Force Base


1545
01:12:24.304 --> 01:12:27.790
and there was this
craft sitting there


1546
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:30.586
and this little red
dot that I have here


1547
01:12:30.586 --> 01:12:33.796
shows you the attempted
point of entry.


1548
01:12:33.796 --> 01:12:36.178
They were using a
diamond tip drill bit


1549
01:12:36.178 --> 01:12:37.904
to try to get into this craft.

1550
01:12:37.904 --> 01:12:40.009
So the question is, if
this is one of ours,


1551
01:12:40.009 --> 01:12:42.736
why would they be
trying to get into this?


1552
01:12:42.736 --> 01:12:44.911
So is this the
beginning origin point


1553
01:12:44.911 --> 01:12:47.362
of a reverse
engineering program?


1554
01:12:48.708 --> 01:12:51.020
Some of the UFO crash
retrieval material,


1555
01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.022
we've looked at
it and we've found


1556
01:12:53.022 --> 01:12:57.372
that the materials
used are very strange.


1557
01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:59.097
When
extraterrestrial material


1558
01:12:59.097 --> 01:13:01.755
is recovered through
military crash retrievals


1559
01:13:01.755 --> 01:13:04.102
and its metallic
structure is examined


1560
01:13:04.102 --> 01:13:07.347
under a microscope,
the metal is so pure


1561
01:13:07.347 --> 01:13:10.764
that we could not replicate
it even in the vacuum space.


1562
01:13:11.558 --> 01:13:15.182
This is because extraterrestrial
crafts are not manufactured


1563
01:13:15.182 --> 01:13:17.253
on a Ford assembly line

1564
01:13:17.253 --> 01:13:20.256
the way humans would
manufacture something.


1565
01:13:20.256 --> 01:13:22.845
Everything in the material
universe has a frequency


1566
01:13:22.845 --> 01:13:26.055
and a corresponding
sound vibration


1567
01:13:26.055 --> 01:13:28.713
that creates and
sustains its being.


1568
01:13:28.713 --> 01:13:31.164
Extraterrestrials
manufacture objects


1569
01:13:31.164 --> 01:13:34.616
by first creating a
resonant frequency.


1570
01:13:34.616 --> 01:13:38.447
For instance, the frequency
of a flying saucer.


1571
01:13:38.447 --> 01:13:41.657
This is a sort of vibrational
blueprint that interacts


1572
01:13:41.657 --> 01:13:44.453
with the substrate of
the physical universe,


1573
01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:47.767
pulling into existence,
from other dimensions,


1574
01:13:47.767 --> 01:13:50.908
atoms and molecules that
then organize and condense


1575
01:13:50.908 --> 01:13:53.635
into the structure of
the object being created.


1576
01:13:54.083 --> 01:13:57.915
In this way
extraterrestrial material


1577
01:13:57.915 --> 01:14:00.745
is literally
manifested into being,


1578
01:14:00.745 --> 01:14:03.507
like trans-dimensional

1579
01:14:03.507 --> 01:14:05.509
or "Star Trek"'s
replicator technology.


1580
01:14:20.765 --> 01:14:23.906
Moving on to 1963.

1581
01:14:23.906 --> 01:14:27.323
This is a marine, he was
called from Cherry Point,


1582
01:14:27.323 --> 01:14:30.326
North Carolina to an
undisclosed location


1583
01:14:30.326 --> 01:14:33.502
and his job was to
guard something there.


1584
01:14:33.502 --> 01:14:35.815
And when he got
to this facility,


1585
01:14:35.815 --> 01:14:39.474
they opened up these
doors and he saw,


1586
01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:41.337
propped up on scaffolding,

1587
01:14:41.337 --> 01:14:43.754
this 40-foot diameter
dish-shaped craft


1588
01:14:43.754 --> 01:14:45.687
that looked like
a fat hamburger.


1589
01:14:45.687 --> 01:14:47.999
It was about 15 feet tall.

1590
01:14:47.999 --> 01:14:50.312
He noticed that there
was a white circle


1591
01:14:50.312 --> 01:14:53.695
painted on the floor
and his job was to shoot


1592
01:14:53.695 --> 01:14:57.526
to kill anyone who would
try to breach that circle.


1593
01:14:57.526 --> 01:15:01.737
They were trying three ways
to get into this craft.


1594
01:15:01.737 --> 01:15:04.291
Number one was a
diamond-tip drill bit.


1595
01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:06.535
So we've got two
cases of this now,


1596
01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:09.642
number two was in a
settling torch, that failed.


1597
01:15:09.642 --> 01:15:13.128
And then the final attempt
was bringing in two


1598
01:15:13.128 --> 01:15:15.406
18-wheeler tractor
trailer, low boy trucks


1599
01:15:15.406 --> 01:15:19.479
that had these very high
voltage generating devices


1600
01:15:19.479 --> 01:15:23.518
and they were using a laser
to get into this craft.


1601
01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.936
In a previously
unreleased interview


1602
01:15:27.936 --> 01:15:31.249
with aerospace
designer Brad Sorenson,


1603
01:15:31.249 --> 01:15:33.389
Sorenson describes
a secret air show


1604
01:15:33.389 --> 01:15:36.427
that took place at
Norton Air Force Base


1605
01:15:36.427 --> 01:15:39.706
on November 12th of 1988.

1606
01:15:39.706 --> 01:15:42.088
A classified military exhibit

1607
01:15:42.088 --> 01:15:45.263
in which so-called alien
reproduction vehicles


1608
01:15:45.263 --> 01:15:46.264
were unveiled.

1609
01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:49.164
The craft were
hovering off the floor


1610
01:15:49.164 --> 01:15:51.131
with no landing gear underneath

1611
01:15:51.131 --> 01:15:53.168
and nothing supporting
it from above.


1612
01:15:54.687 --> 01:15:57.759
When asked, where did they
get these concepts from?


1613
01:15:57.759 --> 01:16:01.107
Sorenson states, "They
said they copied it."


1614
01:16:03.419 --> 01:16:05.629
By the way, these went all
through the solar system,


1615
01:16:05.629 --> 01:16:12.601
the components, mercury era

1616
01:16:12.877 --> 01:16:14.672
So these were operational.

1617
01:16:14.672 --> 01:16:16.812
When did we master
gravity control


1618
01:16:16.812 --> 01:16:19.228
where these were being
functionally built


1619
01:16:19.228 --> 01:16:22.197
by classified projects
here on Earth,


1620
01:16:22.197 --> 01:16:23.716
not extraterrestrial.

1621
01:16:23.716 --> 01:16:26.132
October, 1954.

1622
01:16:26.132 --> 01:16:29.169
So here we are riding on
the surface of the roads


1623
01:16:29.169 --> 01:16:32.794
in cars and belching out
garbage and pollution.


1624
01:16:32.794 --> 01:16:35.279
When I say a lost
century, it really is.


1625
01:16:35.279 --> 01:16:37.074
They were already
working on these programs


1626
01:16:37.074 --> 01:16:39.697
as early as 1948, during
the Clinton administration,


1627
01:16:39.697 --> 01:16:42.251
they were spending

1628
01:16:42.251 --> 01:16:44.115
a day on black budget programs.

1629
01:16:44.115 --> 01:16:45.634
The big question is,

1630
01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:48.637
has this been integrated
into the aerospace industry?


1631
01:16:48.637 --> 01:16:52.054
And if we look at what the
witnesses are reporting,


1632
01:16:52.054 --> 01:16:55.126
they're reporting similar
things across time,


1633
01:16:55.126 --> 01:17:00.925
across dates, locations, now
this is March 23rd, 1966.


1634
01:17:00.925 --> 01:17:02.962
This is Temple Oklahoma.

1635
01:17:02.962 --> 01:17:05.412
Primary eyewitness
name is Eddie Lackson


1636
01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:07.138
And he was an
electrical engineer.


1637
01:17:07.138 --> 01:17:08.899
He was working at
Shepherd Air Force Base.


1638
01:17:08.899 --> 01:17:10.383
So he's commuting to work,

1639
01:17:10.383 --> 01:17:12.937
it's about five or six in the
morning and I wanna stress


1640
01:17:12.937 --> 01:17:14.490
that this is not my case.

1641
01:17:14.490 --> 01:17:17.942
This is an actual
United States Air Force


1642
01:17:17.942 --> 01:17:19.426
Project Blue Book case.

1643
01:17:19.426 --> 01:17:21.739
And it can be verified
through Project Blue Book.


1644
01:17:21.739 --> 01:17:24.846
So he's going to work in the
morning and all of a sudden


1645
01:17:24.846 --> 01:17:29.505
something is blocking
the road in front of him


1646
01:17:29.505 --> 01:17:31.818
and he notices something
that looks all the world


1647
01:17:31.818 --> 01:17:34.510
like a tipped over bowling pin.

1648
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:36.547
It's about 75 feet across,

1649
01:17:36.547 --> 01:17:39.343
on the Starbird side of the
craft that you see here,


1650
01:17:39.343 --> 01:17:42.622
there was an air stair
cutout door and a man,


1651
01:17:42.622 --> 01:17:45.729
I wanna stress, this was a
man, this is not an alien.


1652
01:17:45.729 --> 01:17:48.628
He was wearing two piece
green military fatigues.


1653
01:17:48.628 --> 01:17:51.113
He had a baseball cap
with the bill turned up


1654
01:17:51.113 --> 01:17:53.012
and he was shining a flashlight

1655
01:17:53.012 --> 01:17:54.738
near the bottom of the steps.

1656
01:17:54.738 --> 01:17:56.567
Above this air stair door,

1657
01:17:56.567 --> 01:18:00.467
there was an interesting stinger
or spire that tapered back


1658
01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:02.297
and swept back to the
end of the vehicle.


1659
01:18:02.297 --> 01:18:04.402
And at the end of this spire

1660
01:18:04.402 --> 01:18:06.232
there was about an
eight inch dire sphere.


1661
01:18:06.232 --> 01:18:09.718
And that's interesting
because I keep getting reports


1662
01:18:09.718 --> 01:18:14.033
from the eyewitnesses
of spheres and balls


1663
01:18:14.033 --> 01:18:18.002
and protrusions and prongs
sticking out of these UFOs.


1664
01:18:18.002 --> 01:18:21.005
And if you look at what the
eyewitnesses are describing


1665
01:18:21.005 --> 01:18:23.905
to us and you look and examine

1666
01:18:23.905 --> 01:18:28.426
high voltage electrical
equipment, it's a match.


1667
01:18:28.426 --> 01:18:31.360
I believe I can make a
case that the components


1668
01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.949
that people are
seeing on these UFOs


1669
01:18:33.949 --> 01:18:38.229
are off the shelf, high
voltage electrical components.


1670
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:42.095
When this gentleman who
was this military green


1671
01:18:42.095 --> 01:18:44.132
fatigue gentleman,
when he noticed


1672
01:18:44.132 --> 01:18:46.721
that he was being
watched by Eddie Lexton,


1673
01:18:46.721 --> 01:18:50.621
he scurried up this ladder,
he slammed this door shut


1674
01:18:50.621 --> 01:18:54.073
and then there was a high
pitched drilling noise.


1675
01:18:54.073 --> 01:18:57.628
This craft levitated off
the ground and then took off


1676
01:18:57.628 --> 01:18:58.974
like a spark on a grinding wheel

1677
01:18:58.974 --> 01:19:00.769
and made no sonic
boom whatsoever.


1678
01:19:00.769 --> 01:19:04.186
This is back in 1966,
rockets are obsolete,


1679
01:19:04.186 --> 01:19:07.258
solid rockets are obsolete,
jets are obsolete.


1680
01:21:44.312 --> 01:21:46.107
So how can all this be true?

1681
01:21:46.107 --> 01:21:47.902
And we're still flying jets.

1682
01:21:49.041 --> 01:21:51.629
Elon Musk tweeted this out.

1683
01:22:19.519 --> 01:22:21.349
That's all very comical.

1684
01:22:21.349 --> 01:22:25.180
It's not comical when
astronauts I know have friends


1685
01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:28.321
that died in this, the
Challenger tragedy.


1686
01:22:33.568 --> 01:22:34.741
Flight
controllers here,


1687
01:22:34.741 --> 01:22:36.088
looking very carefully
at the situation,


1688
01:22:37.641 --> 01:22:39.298
obviously a major malfunction.

1689
01:22:42.025 --> 01:22:44.820
We're awaiting,
there holding their breath


1690
01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:47.133
just I'm sure as
everyone else is,


1691
01:22:47.133 --> 01:22:49.549
in the center of the
fire and the smoke


1692
01:22:49.549 --> 01:22:54.382
you can't see any form of
what was once the shuttle.


1693
01:22:58.455 --> 01:23:02.666
Here they are going up
on a Roman candle 40 years,


1694
01:23:02.666 --> 01:23:05.289
50 years, 60 years

1695
01:23:05.289 --> 01:23:08.534
after we already
had gravity control.


1696
01:23:08.534 --> 01:23:11.261
This is the biggest
coverup scandal


1697
01:23:11.261 --> 01:23:16.162
in the known history of
the world, full stop.


1698
01:23:16.162 --> 01:23:17.577
We've already
got the technology


1699
01:23:17.577 --> 01:23:19.890
to do away with solid
rocket boosters.


1700
01:23:19.890 --> 01:23:21.512
We've already got the technology

1701
01:23:21.512 --> 01:23:23.583
to take away completely
liquid rockets.


1702
01:23:23.583 --> 01:23:27.587
Why wasn't the Challenger crew
briefed on this technology


1703
01:23:27.587 --> 01:23:31.315
if we already had the
breakthrough in 1954?


1704
01:23:31.315 --> 01:23:34.042
And so then people get
into, how can this be?


1705
01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:35.250
I put this out a lot

1706
01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:38.046
'cause it's a not
declassified document,


1707
01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:42.602
but you have an organization
called MAJIC, M-A-J-I,


1708
01:23:42.602 --> 01:23:45.536
Majority Intelligence
Committee and a few others


1709
01:23:45.536 --> 01:23:47.642
that run these covert projects.

1710
01:23:47.642 --> 01:23:51.025
They are beyond
black, what do I mean?


1711
01:23:51.025 --> 01:23:53.648
They're unacknowledged
special access projects.


1712
01:23:53.648 --> 01:23:55.995
I'm sure you also unacknowledged,

1713
01:23:55.995 --> 01:23:59.171
but these are the projects
that are off the radar


1714
01:23:59.171 --> 01:24:01.967
even of the people who
managed the black projects.


1715
01:24:01.967 --> 01:24:03.554
So I call this beyond black,

1716
01:24:03.554 --> 01:24:06.902
these are way off book and
this was a security alert


1717
01:24:06.902 --> 01:24:09.733
with the distribution
list back in the '90s.


1718
01:24:09.733 --> 01:24:12.391
So I gave this some
people in the Pentagon,


1719
01:24:12.391 --> 01:24:13.392
like Admiral Wilson,

1720
01:24:13.392 --> 01:24:14.980
who I briefed to as the
head of intelligence,


1721
01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:16.050
Joint Chiefs of Staff.

1722
01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:17.879
And they got inside the program.

1723
01:24:17.879 --> 01:24:20.261
I'm doing that now for
a whole new generation


1724
01:24:20.261 --> 01:24:22.159
of people since
the law was passed,


1725
01:24:22.159 --> 01:24:24.299
to get to the bottom
of what UFOs are


1726
01:24:24.299 --> 01:24:26.715
or what they call now UAPs,
nobody calls them that.


1727
01:24:26.715 --> 01:24:28.062
It's ridiculous.

1728
01:24:28.062 --> 01:24:29.856
Let me tell you
what our UFO, UFA,


1729
01:24:29.856 --> 01:24:33.101
they make up these fake
names that are obfuscating,


1730
01:24:33.101 --> 01:24:35.448
unexplained aerial phenomenon

1731
01:24:36.587 --> 01:24:37.933
like ball lightning
or something.


1732
01:24:37.933 --> 01:24:39.694
No it isn't.

1733
01:24:39.694 --> 01:24:41.178
First of all, it's
not unexplained.


1734
01:24:41.178 --> 01:24:42.455
Secondly, it's not aerial.

1735
01:24:42.455 --> 01:24:44.250
And it's not just
some phenomenon.


1736
01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:48.703
They're either man-made
UFOs or extraterrestrial.


1737
01:24:48.703 --> 01:24:50.153
That's it, keep it simple.

1738
01:24:50.153 --> 01:24:52.500
The hardest thing
for the senators


1739
01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:55.296
and the White House people
and the general public


1740
01:24:55.296 --> 01:24:58.023
and particularly the
media to understand,


1741
01:24:58.023 --> 01:25:01.612
or scientists, is
that if this is true,


1742
01:25:01.612 --> 01:25:03.994
how could it be that
it has been kept secret


1743
01:25:03.994 --> 01:25:07.998
from the people, they're very
good at counterintelligence.


1744
01:25:07.998 --> 01:25:11.036
So it's structured as
Eisenhower warned us,


1745
01:25:11.036 --> 01:25:13.314
we're the military
industrial complex.


1746
01:25:14.315 --> 01:25:16.041
In the councils of government,

1747
01:25:16.041 --> 01:25:18.215
we must guard against
the acquisition


1748
01:25:18.215 --> 01:25:21.701
of unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought


1749
01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:25.464
by the military
industrial complex.


1750
01:25:25.464 --> 01:25:28.708
A very strong warning
of what he saw coming


1751
01:25:28.708 --> 01:25:31.953
because he'd been living
with it for eight years.


1752
01:25:31.953 --> 01:25:35.853
The CIA was only created
in 1947 and the Pentagon


1753
01:25:35.853 --> 01:25:39.167
and its generals were
gaining much more power.


1754
01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:43.344
And as the nuclear
age progressed and
Eisenhower saw it.


1755
01:25:44.724 --> 01:25:47.244
The combination of military
power with industry.


1756
01:25:47.244 --> 01:25:49.971
If you think about what
the industrial part is


1757
01:25:49.971 --> 01:25:52.180
of the military
industrial complex.


1758
01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:54.769
The industrial is basically
the fossil fuel giants


1759
01:25:54.769 --> 01:25:59.670
and the chemical companies
and now increasingly


1760
01:25:59.670 --> 01:26:04.227
the pharmaceutical companies
that are running rampant


1761
01:26:05.745 --> 01:26:08.231
and increasing their wealth
by astronomical proportions.


1762
01:26:09.439 --> 01:26:11.682
This is just the value
of the raw materials.


1763
01:26:11.682 --> 01:26:15.100
Look at these numbers,
$150 trillion in oil,


1764
01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:19.138
that's actually an underestimate
now, 40 trillion in coal,


1765
01:26:19.138 --> 01:26:22.624
a trillion in uranium,
but that's just the raw,


1766
01:26:22.624 --> 01:26:23.936
when you multiplier effect,

1767
01:26:23.936 --> 01:26:25.696
when you take it
from there to retail


1768
01:26:25.696 --> 01:26:27.181
and creating the energy,

1769
01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:29.942
it's many more
hundreds of trillions


1770
01:26:29.942 --> 01:26:31.564
and that's what's
being protected,


1771
01:26:31.564 --> 01:26:34.981
along with the Brenton
Woods Petrodollar,


1772
01:26:34.981 --> 01:26:36.259
where they decide
to make the dollar


1773
01:26:36.259 --> 01:26:37.639
the reserve currency
of the world.


1774
01:26:37.639 --> 01:26:39.814
But it's based cost
the Petrodollar.


1775
01:26:39.814 --> 01:26:44.129
So the entire macroeconomic,
global economic system


1776
01:26:44.129 --> 01:26:47.097
is sitting on a
crumbling foundation


1777
01:26:47.097 --> 01:26:49.064
of the energy system we use.

1778
01:26:49.064 --> 01:26:51.101
And it's gonna have
to be transitioned.


1779
01:26:51.101 --> 01:26:53.586
It should have
happened 100 years ago.


1780
01:26:53.586 --> 01:26:55.001
Now we're out of time.

1781
01:26:56.693 --> 01:26:58.384
The malfactors
of great wealth,


1782
01:26:58.384 --> 01:27:01.698
as Teddy Roosevelt
once warned us about,


1783
01:27:01.698 --> 01:27:03.320
writing the laws,

1784
01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:05.598
paying politicians to write
the laws that they want.


1785
01:27:05.598 --> 01:27:06.875
Why is that happening?

1786
01:27:06.875 --> 01:27:09.361
And Robert Kennedy Jr.
wrote the introduction


1787
01:27:09.361 --> 01:27:11.673
to both additions
of my recent book,


1788
01:27:11.673 --> 01:27:13.158
which was "Horseman
of the Apocalypse",


1789
01:27:13.158 --> 01:27:15.919
became "Climate in Crisis"
in its most recent version.


1790
01:27:15.919 --> 01:27:16.989
And he said this,

1791
01:27:16.989 --> 01:27:19.129
which I think is quite apropos

1792
01:27:19.129 --> 01:27:21.580
to what I've been
talking about today.


1793
01:27:23.478 --> 01:27:25.687
"They work together in lockstep,

1794
01:27:25.687 --> 01:27:28.380
coordinated by Capitol
Hill trade associations,


1795
01:27:28.380 --> 01:27:31.072
lobbying firms,
captive agencies,


1796
01:27:31.072 --> 01:27:36.284
and paid off politicians to
increase authoritarian control,


1797
01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:39.805
to transform all of us
into mindless consumers,


1798
01:27:39.805 --> 01:27:41.772
to shift middle class wealth,

1799
01:27:41.772 --> 01:27:44.672
to billionaire plutocrats
and to liquidate


1800
01:27:44.672 --> 01:27:48.331
our purple mountain majesties
and our entire planet.


1801
01:27:49.539 --> 01:27:53.474
They have declared war on
democracy and personal freedom."


1802
01:27:55.407 --> 01:28:00.377
A shadowy government with its
own air force, his own navy,


1803
01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:03.967
its own fundraising mechanism

1804
01:28:05.175 --> 01:28:07.177
and the ability to
pursue its own ideas


1805
01:28:07.177 --> 01:28:10.629
of the national interest,
free from all checks


1806
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:14.564
and balances and free
from the law itself.


1807
01:28:14.564 --> 01:28:17.808
So get your mind about
this, there is the government,


1808
01:28:17.808 --> 01:28:20.570
constitutional government
of the United States


1809
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:23.607
and then there's this other
secret government operation


1810
01:28:23.607 --> 01:28:27.887
which has more money, more
power, more technology.


1811
01:28:27.887 --> 01:28:29.751
It is a criminal enterprise.

1812
01:28:29.751 --> 01:28:31.650
It is not sanctioned
by the president,


1813
01:28:31.650 --> 01:28:33.652
that is not sanctioned
by Congress,


1814
01:28:33.652 --> 01:28:35.826
and yet they're
using our tax dollars


1815
01:28:35.826 --> 01:28:38.795
and are raping the planet
and destroying the Earth


1816
01:28:38.795 --> 01:28:41.211
and impoverishing
half the planet.


1817
01:28:41.211 --> 01:28:43.627
That's what we have to fix.

1818
01:28:43.627 --> 01:28:48.011
We've got at least 109
UFO crash retrieval cases.


1819
01:28:48.011 --> 01:28:50.669
All we need is
one to be correct.


1820
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:53.154
And if they exploited
the technology


1821
01:28:53.154 --> 01:28:55.018
associated with these craft

1822
01:28:55.018 --> 01:28:58.539
and procured that and put it
into our aerospace industry,


1823
01:28:58.539 --> 01:29:01.231
they have made a
tremendous breakthrough


1824
01:29:01.231 --> 01:29:05.304
in aerospace
technology that I think


1825
01:29:05.304 --> 01:29:07.893
that our Challenger astronauts
should have been briefed on.


1826
01:29:07.893 --> 01:29:10.447
Our Apollo astronaut should
have been briefed on.


1827
01:29:10.447 --> 01:29:13.933
And we could have avoided all
of this obsolete technology


1828
01:29:13.933 --> 01:29:17.005
and we could all move forward
to that wonderful world


1829
01:29:17.005 --> 01:29:21.803
and are not basically bound
to these oil industries.


1830
01:29:21.803 --> 01:29:25.255
Some people wonder why we
don't know more about this.


1831
01:29:25.255 --> 01:29:30.260
Why isn't the media telling
us what's really going on?


1832
01:29:31.606 --> 01:29:36.611
We have about 15 billionaires
and six corporations


1833
01:29:38.026 --> 01:29:42.272
controlling 90% of the
media in the United States.


1834
01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:47.622
We've got AT, Comcast,
Walt Disney Company,


1835
01:29:47.622 --> 01:29:49.106
National Amusements,

1836
01:29:49.106 --> 01:29:54.008
that includes Viacom and CBS
News and Fox Corporation.


1837
01:29:54.008 --> 01:29:56.217
They rely on advertising revenue

1838
01:29:56.217 --> 01:30:00.014
and that's gonna mean they're
towing a certain line.


1839
01:30:00.014 --> 01:30:02.844
This is a CIA document,
it was released,


1840
01:30:02.844 --> 01:30:04.915
a surprise that was
released and it says


1841
01:30:04.915 --> 01:30:06.123
that "We have relationship

1842
01:30:06.123 --> 01:30:08.609
with every major wire
service newspaper,


1843
01:30:08.609 --> 01:30:11.405
Newsweek, and television
network in the nation.


1844
01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:13.476
In many instances we
have persuaded reporters


1845
01:30:13.476 --> 01:30:14.994
to postpone change,

1846
01:30:14.994 --> 01:30:18.550
hold or scrap stories that
could have adversely affected


1847
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:20.137
national security interests

1848
01:30:20.137 --> 01:30:23.278
or jeopardized
sources and methods."


1849
01:30:23.278 --> 01:30:25.833
Here's another part
of your "Truman Show"


1850
01:30:25.833 --> 01:30:28.387
everyone's been
forced to live in,


1851
01:30:28.387 --> 01:30:30.803
the idea that we
have a free press


1852
01:30:30.803 --> 01:30:34.600
or that we have a
free market economy.


1853
01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:37.500
Pray tell any economist
in here, I challenge you,


1854
01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:41.504
how do we have a free
market if the most important


1855
01:30:41.504 --> 01:30:44.817
scientific breakthroughs
of the last 100 years


1856
01:30:44.817 --> 01:30:47.406
have been ruthlessly confiscated,

1857
01:30:47.406 --> 01:30:50.236
people murdered and
kept off the market?


1858
01:30:50.236 --> 01:30:55.000
No, it's a controlled economy,
it's a controlled media,


1859
01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:58.417
it's an abomination and
it's killing the planet.


1860
01:30:58.417 --> 01:30:59.832
There were days when I wished

1861
01:30:59.832 --> 01:31:02.525
I had never seen free energy.

1862
01:31:02.525 --> 01:31:07.840
The amount of pain that you
wake up at three o'clock


1863
01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:10.636
in the morning because
you can't do anything.


1864
01:31:10.636 --> 01:31:13.743
And you know that
pollution can be cleaned up


1865
01:31:13.743 --> 01:31:18.782
and everyone is on the
same economic basis.


1866
01:31:20.232 --> 01:31:23.960
And because you're powering
everything with the free energy,


1867
01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:30.104
you can do really
what the philosopher
Joseph Campbell said,


1868
01:31:30.104 --> 01:31:33.176
he said, to seek
after your bliss.


1869
01:31:33.176 --> 01:31:36.766
And I think that
free energy does it.


1870
01:31:38.802 --> 01:31:39.872
And so what do we do?

1871
01:31:39.872 --> 01:31:42.012
Well the current paradigm
we just went through,


1872
01:31:42.012 --> 01:31:44.049
the new would be
unlimited abundance.


1873
01:31:44.049 --> 01:31:46.085
No poverty in 20 years.

1874
01:31:46.085 --> 01:31:47.742
There would be no
poverty on Earth


1875
01:31:47.742 --> 01:31:50.055
in 20 years with
these technologies.


1876
01:31:50.055 --> 01:31:51.539
Universal peace,

1877
01:31:51.539 --> 01:31:53.196
because you're not fighting
over everything now


1878
01:31:53.196 --> 01:31:56.855
and Earth and
harmony with humanity


1879
01:31:56.855 --> 01:31:59.374
and the biosphere restored.

1880
01:32:00.721 --> 01:32:02.550
It's important to
realize that the technology


1881
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:04.725
that is required to heal Earth

1882
01:32:04.725 --> 01:32:08.694
already exists and has
existed for a long time.


1883
01:32:09.695 --> 01:32:13.147
That the problem is not
fundamentally technological.


1884
01:32:13.147 --> 01:32:16.012
If we came into
coherence around the goal


1885
01:32:16.012 --> 01:32:19.360
of healing Earth, we
could do it in five years


1886
01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:23.709
because the capacity of life
to heal is just incredible.


1887
01:32:23.709 --> 01:32:26.194
But we're just in the
way of it all the time.


1888
01:32:26.194 --> 01:32:29.301
I mean even look what happens
if you stop paving over


1889
01:32:29.301 --> 01:32:32.822
a parking lot in five
years, cracks appear.


1890
01:32:32.822 --> 01:32:35.652
Weeds are growing out
of it, in 15 years,


1891
01:32:35.652 --> 01:32:38.137
you see chunks of
pavement here and there


1892
01:32:38.137 --> 01:32:40.450
and trees are
growing, in 50 years,


1893
01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:43.522
you don't even know a
parking lot was ever there.


1894
01:32:43.522 --> 01:32:47.146
In order to maintain Earth
in a state of ugliness


1895
01:32:47.146 --> 01:32:50.460
and un-life requires
constant effort


1896
01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:54.913
because the power of life
to live is so strong.


1897
01:32:54.913 --> 01:32:56.293
That's what life wants to do.

1898
01:32:56.293 --> 01:32:57.950
It wants to live.

1899
01:32:57.950 --> 01:33:00.988
We're only make 100
million cars a year.


1900
01:33:00.988 --> 01:33:04.612
If we converted like that,
which is not gonna happen,


1901
01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:06.062
all manufacturing of automobiles

1902
01:33:06.062 --> 01:33:09.375
to these zero point
energy generators,


1903
01:33:09.375 --> 01:33:14.380
it would take, do
the math, 15 years.


1904
01:33:14.380 --> 01:33:16.762
We barely have 15 years left.

1905
01:33:16.762 --> 01:33:21.387
The date I've been given,

1906
01:33:24.839 --> 01:33:26.979
The scale
of the transition


1907
01:33:26.979 --> 01:33:29.706
is almost unthinkable.

1908
01:33:29.706 --> 01:33:33.192
There are an estimated

1909
01:33:33.192 --> 01:33:35.747
of paved roads across the Earth.

1910
01:33:35.747 --> 01:33:38.646
There are many millions more
of power lines comprising


1911
01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.924
the so-called smart grid.

1912
01:33:40.924 --> 01:33:44.549
A real smart grid would
be no grid at all.


1913
01:33:44.549 --> 01:33:47.793
We need a compassionate transition.

1914
01:33:47.793 --> 01:33:50.520
Instead of displacing
millions of workers


1915
01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:53.523
who support today's
energy infrastructure,


1916
01:33:53.523 --> 01:33:57.044
we must enlist them in
the radical transformation


1917
01:33:57.044 --> 01:33:59.115
of our world that
lies before us.


1918
01:34:00.357 --> 01:34:02.567
We've all heard of
the Hopi prophecy,


1919
01:34:02.567 --> 01:34:06.709
probably, there are two
lines on the Hopi prophecy.


1920
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:10.195
Right now, our entire
planet is on the line,


1921
01:34:10.195 --> 01:34:13.267
the upper line that terminates.

1922
01:34:13.267 --> 01:34:16.995
We're an extinction-level
event trajectory.


1923
01:34:16.995 --> 01:34:18.583
That's the path we're on.

1924
01:34:18.583 --> 01:34:21.689
There's another line in the
Hopi prophecies and that's one


1925
01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:25.900
that we have to jump onto
that goes on and on forever.


1926
01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:27.833
That's our choice.

1927
01:34:27.833 --> 01:34:29.939
We, the people,
have to choose it.


1928
01:34:29.939 --> 01:34:33.287
It is not gonna be done
for you like a Ouija board


1929
01:34:33.287 --> 01:34:35.565
in Washington or at Wall Street.

1930
01:34:35.565 --> 01:34:38.154
We're gonna have to unite
and do this ourselves.


1931
01:34:39.742 --> 01:34:42.434
You can imagine
the civilization
that has figured out


1932
01:34:42.434 --> 01:34:44.056
the over-unity question

1933
01:34:44.056 --> 01:34:46.093
as being one in which
the centralization


1934
01:34:46.093 --> 01:34:48.129
of power and therefore
the centralization


1935
01:34:48.129 --> 01:34:49.683
of the inputs necessary

1936
01:34:49.683 --> 01:34:52.617
for the growth of civilization
becomes more decentralized.


1937
01:34:52.617 --> 01:34:55.378
So rather than these power
stations that are clustered


1938
01:34:55.378 --> 01:34:56.897
around big cities,

1939
01:34:56.897 --> 01:35:01.073
you can have energy generation
mechanisms in every home.


1940
01:35:02.316 --> 01:35:03.455
And this is why
it's a new world.


1941
01:35:03.455 --> 01:35:05.664
'Cause it's the
power to the people.


1942
01:35:05.664 --> 01:35:08.563
And what it means is literally
not just electric power


1943
01:35:08.563 --> 01:35:12.913
and energy, but actual
political power.


1944
01:35:12.913 --> 01:35:16.330
And in the industrial era,
from the 1800s to now,


1945
01:35:16.330 --> 01:35:19.298
it's gotten more and
more concentrated.


1946
01:35:19.298 --> 01:35:21.024
This is gonna return the power

1947
01:35:21.024 --> 01:35:23.475
to every village
and every person,


1948
01:35:23.475 --> 01:35:26.823
even the deserts shall bloom,
as it says in the Bible


1949
01:35:26.823 --> 01:35:30.516
and in Africa and
around the world,


1950
01:35:30.516 --> 01:35:32.933
they're gonna leap
frog pass where we are


1951
01:35:32.933 --> 01:35:34.831
with all this
electricity and wiring


1952
01:35:34.831 --> 01:35:36.937
and power lines and power plants

1953
01:35:36.937 --> 01:35:39.940
like they did telephones,
they went straight to sell.


1954
01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:42.839
But this is a bigger leap
where all over the world,


1955
01:35:42.839 --> 01:35:44.738
all these impoverished areas,

1956
01:35:44.738 --> 01:35:46.671
every little village
and community


1957
01:35:46.671 --> 01:35:48.673
will have its own
energy generator


1958
01:35:48.673 --> 01:35:51.261
for pulling water out of
the humidity of the air.


1959
01:35:51.261 --> 01:35:54.437
We have the technology to do
that now, why isn't it used?


1960
01:35:54.437 --> 01:35:55.921
'Cause it uses a
lot of electricity,


1961
01:35:55.921 --> 01:35:57.647
which is polluting
and expensive.


1962
01:35:57.647 --> 01:36:00.201
It'll be a global village

1963
01:36:00.201 --> 01:36:04.792
all interconnected, but
also all self-sufficient,


1964
01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:08.796
complete local self-sufficiency
with no pollution.


1965
01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:10.211
That's the world
we could have had


1966
01:36:10.211 --> 01:36:11.454
beginning in the '20s,

1967
01:36:11.454 --> 01:36:15.389
a 100 years later, may
I suggest we accept it.


1968
01:36:15.389 --> 01:36:16.252
It's time.

1969
01:36:16.804 --> 01:36:20.083
We are 100 years behind
where we should be right now.


1970
01:36:20.083 --> 01:36:23.915
Why are we still pounding
metal nails into boards


1971
01:36:23.915 --> 01:36:25.157
to build houses?

1972
01:36:25.157 --> 01:36:28.091
Why are we still loading up
shipping containers on tankers


1973
01:36:28.091 --> 01:36:30.507
and taking two
months to get here?


1974
01:36:30.507 --> 01:36:32.820
This is all a construct.

1975
01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:34.788
And why I call
this a time snap.


1976
01:36:34.788 --> 01:36:39.724
A time snap is when things
have gone so far off track.


1977
01:36:39.724 --> 01:36:43.003
The only way to fix it is
for the people to unite


1978
01:36:43.003 --> 01:36:45.522
and come up with a
totally different strategy


1979
01:36:45.522 --> 01:36:47.524
where in a decade
to two decades,


1980
01:36:47.524 --> 01:36:50.010
we make up for 100
years, it can happen.


1981
01:36:50.010 --> 01:36:53.427
And you know, if nothing
else, humans do wanna survive.


1982
01:36:53.427 --> 01:36:56.844
But this is now a survival
question for every man, woman,


1983
01:36:56.844 --> 01:36:59.364
and child on the Earth, so
that's why we have to do this.


1984
01:36:59.364 --> 01:37:01.021
We have to remember also

1985
01:37:01.021 --> 01:37:05.853
that the capacity for life
to heal is almost unlimited.


1986
01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:07.717
And we see this
already with people


1987
01:37:07.717 --> 01:37:11.583
who are restoring ecosystems
and regenerating farmland.


1988
01:37:11.583 --> 01:37:14.275
Even in a few years,
miracles happen.


1989
01:37:15.483 --> 01:37:17.209
Springs that have been
dead for generations


1990
01:37:17.209 --> 01:37:18.141
come back to life.

1991
01:37:18.141 --> 01:37:20.350
Species that hadn't
been seen in the area


1992
01:37:20.350 --> 01:37:23.353
seemingly magically reappear.

1993
01:37:23.353 --> 01:37:29.049
And so we can't forget that,
we can't succumb to a despair


1994
01:37:29.049 --> 01:37:33.639
that is founded in our distrust
of the power of life itself,


1995
01:37:33.639 --> 01:37:39.024
which again is part of the
origin of our current condition.


1996
01:37:39.749 --> 01:37:44.823
Visualize your
house off the grid.


1997
01:37:44.823 --> 01:37:47.792
Clean energy, no wiring.

1998
01:37:47.792 --> 01:37:48.620
Why?

1999
01:37:48.620 --> 01:37:49.759
'Cause every device,

2000
01:37:49.759 --> 01:37:52.831
whether it's this size
device or your refrigerator,


2001
01:37:52.831 --> 01:37:57.387
will have a small solid
state quantum vacuum,


2002
01:37:57.387 --> 01:38:00.045
zero point energy device
in it, running it.


2003
01:38:00.045 --> 01:38:02.047
So there's there's no
electromagnetic fields


2004
01:38:02.047 --> 01:38:05.016
running through your house
because you don't need wiring.


2005
01:38:05.016 --> 01:38:07.639
Think what that'll do
to construction costs


2006
01:38:07.639 --> 01:38:09.330
and the simplicity of it.

2007
01:38:09.330 --> 01:38:11.229
And here we are in
the Sahara Desert


2008
01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:16.475
and you wanna grow food, you
create a, a biosphere dome.


2009
01:38:16.475 --> 01:38:20.617
It's run on free clean
energy as we've demonstrated,


2010
01:38:20.617 --> 01:38:21.929
you're growing oranges.

2011
01:38:21.929 --> 01:38:23.586
You can grow crops,

2012
01:38:23.586 --> 01:38:25.346
you can have
different zones in it


2013
01:38:25.346 --> 01:38:27.486
for different temperature
and humidity control.


2014
01:38:27.486 --> 01:38:31.007
So anywhere on the planet
that you need to have foods,


2015
01:38:31.007 --> 01:38:34.735
it could be done under a
controlled circumstances,


2016
01:38:34.735 --> 01:38:36.979
digitally automated,

2017
01:38:36.979 --> 01:38:41.569
but with no cost for the
energy and the water.


2018
01:38:41.569 --> 01:38:43.019
Virtually none.

2019
01:38:43.019 --> 01:38:46.402
What that means is the food
scarcity and starvation


2020
01:38:46.402 --> 01:38:49.025
we're facing that
goes away very quickly


2021
01:38:49.025 --> 01:38:51.027
in a 20 year period.

2022
01:38:51.027 --> 01:38:53.650
Here's your typical street
in your neighborhood,


2023
01:38:53.650 --> 01:38:55.825
anywhere in the world.

2024
01:38:55.825 --> 01:38:59.242
And as we bring these
technologies out,


2025
01:38:59.242 --> 01:39:01.796
the grid comes down, we
don't need it anymore.


2026
01:39:01.796 --> 01:39:04.869
When there's a snow storm
or hurricane or whatever,


2027
01:39:04.869 --> 01:39:07.181
you don't lose power because
you're not depending on a grid


2028
01:39:07.181 --> 01:39:11.185
that's gonna be torn down
by ice and snow and wind.


2029
01:39:11.185 --> 01:39:14.361
You don't need wires,
all these wires,


2030
01:39:14.361 --> 01:39:15.638
they'll clutter of wires.

2031
01:39:15.638 --> 01:39:17.433
You don't need them
because every device


2032
01:39:17.433 --> 01:39:19.159
will have its own
source of energy.


2033
01:39:19.159 --> 01:39:21.057
This could have been
done decades ago.


2034
01:39:26.097 --> 01:39:30.998
As we bring these out, all
these freeways will be replaced.


2035
01:39:32.241 --> 01:39:35.244
All the lines, power
lines will go away.


2036
01:39:35.244 --> 01:39:40.525
We can float above the
surface and in every city


2037
01:39:40.525 --> 01:39:43.804
in the world, we're gonna
see this transformation.


2038
01:39:43.804 --> 01:39:45.979
Every village in the world.

2039
01:39:45.979 --> 01:39:47.946
And then we have these cities,

2040
01:39:47.946 --> 01:39:50.604
eventually where
you're just floating.


2041
01:39:50.604 --> 01:39:53.262
They're guided pathways.

2042
01:39:53.262 --> 01:39:55.160
The ground is pristine.

2043
01:39:55.160 --> 01:39:57.749
And then we're going
out into space.


2044
01:39:59.061 --> 01:40:03.513
So everyone remember
where our destiny is.


2045
01:40:03.513 --> 01:40:06.689
Our destiny is not just
Earth, it's the whole cosmos.


2046
01:40:06.689 --> 01:40:09.312
How is that gonna be possible?

2047
01:40:09.312 --> 01:40:12.039
The only way we're allowed to
go outside our solar system


2048
01:40:12.039 --> 01:40:15.801
is if we become a
peaceful civilization.


2049
01:40:15.801 --> 01:40:18.149
Otherwise it's locked down.

2050
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:22.463
We are considered a planet
that is dangerous and armed.


2051
01:40:22.463 --> 01:40:27.606
Each one of us is very
invested in the world as it is.


2052
01:40:27.606 --> 01:40:31.231
We've built careers, relationships,

2053
01:40:31.231 --> 01:40:35.960
and goals based on a world
that doesn't include ETs


2054
01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.478
and anti-gravity and free energy

2055
01:40:37.478 --> 01:40:41.137
and healing devices and all
this cool, abundant stuff.


2056
01:40:41.724 --> 01:40:44.278
And so we need to
understand and really know


2057
01:40:44.278 --> 01:40:48.938
if we are ready for that
investment to be disrupted.


2058
01:40:48.938 --> 01:40:51.423
So one of the most powerful
things that any of us


2059
01:40:51.423 --> 01:40:54.840
can do is to look
in our own hearts.


2060
01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.084
Imagine the world that could be,

2061
01:40:57.084 --> 01:41:00.467
and ask ourselves,
are we ready for that?


2062
01:41:01.433 --> 01:41:03.401
If the answer is yes,

2063
01:41:03.401 --> 01:41:05.541
then hold that
readiness in your heart


2064
01:41:05.541 --> 01:41:08.199
in all the excitement
that it's due.


2065
01:41:09.234 --> 01:41:11.271
If the answer is no,

2066
01:41:11.271 --> 01:41:13.618
if there are some
lingering doubts


2067
01:41:13.618 --> 01:41:17.173
or fears or concerns,
then go into that.


2068
01:41:17.173 --> 01:41:18.312
Follow that.

2069
01:41:18.312 --> 01:41:20.418
That's an important thread
that you can follow back


2070
01:41:20.418 --> 01:41:23.421
to something inside of
you that needs attention.


2071
01:41:23.421 --> 01:41:26.631
It's that obstacle
that may be keeping us


2072
01:41:26.631 --> 01:41:28.667
from living in this new world.

2073
01:41:30.324 --> 01:41:35.467
In [indistinct] Forest, in
the air force base in 1980,


2074
01:41:36.537 --> 01:41:38.884
a roughly pyramid-shaped
craft landed.


2075
01:41:38.884 --> 01:41:40.541
You've all heard
this count probably,


2076
01:41:40.541 --> 01:41:42.095
but I'll recount it for you.

2077
01:41:42.095 --> 01:41:44.649
And the part that's
classified, you don't know.


2078
01:41:44.649 --> 01:41:46.754
There were these kind
of luminous beams


2079
01:41:46.754 --> 01:41:48.273
that literally teleported,

2080
01:41:48.273 --> 01:41:52.933
floated outside this black
pyramid and communicated


2081
01:41:52.933 --> 01:41:56.557
with these air force
officers and the ET said,


2082
01:41:56.557 --> 01:42:03.564
we are your descendants who
have become interstellar.


2083
01:42:04.048 --> 01:42:08.224
But we are from 500,000
years in the future


2084
01:42:08.224 --> 01:42:09.812
and we are now here.

2085
01:42:09.812 --> 01:42:13.436
They basically materialized
time travel to 1980.


2086
01:42:13.436 --> 01:42:15.956
Because this was a covert
nuclear weapons facility


2087
01:42:15.956 --> 01:42:17.406
that if that had been disclosed,

2088
01:42:17.406 --> 01:42:20.305
could have triggered
World War III and saying,


2089
01:42:20.305 --> 01:42:23.584
you've gotta stop doing this,
if you stay on this path, we,


2090
01:42:23.584 --> 01:42:26.656
your children's, children's,
children's children,


2091
01:42:26.656 --> 01:42:30.108
20,000 years into the
future, we won't exist.


2092
01:42:32.110 --> 01:42:35.665
That was 42 years ago.

2093
01:42:35.665 --> 01:42:37.840
So they have been warning,
these civilizations


2094
01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:41.706
from other star systems, some
of them are our descendants.


2095
01:42:41.706 --> 01:42:44.502
Not all, not all, but some are.

2096
01:42:44.502 --> 01:42:46.193
The key thing to
remember here is,


2097
01:42:46.193 --> 01:42:48.851
is that the fact that
that happened is a message


2098
01:42:48.851 --> 01:42:51.716
of great hope, it means
that there is a chance,


2099
01:42:51.716 --> 01:42:56.755
a good chance, if we reach
into our higher consciousness


2100
01:42:56.755 --> 01:42:59.137
and we go forward
with a strategy


2101
01:42:59.137 --> 01:43:02.140
that isn't based on
materialism and greed.


2102
01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:03.555
This is a massive undertaking,

2103
01:43:03.555 --> 01:43:06.110
my friends, but I'm
convinced we can do it.


2104
01:43:06.110 --> 01:43:10.217
But we have to completely
rethink how we live, how we act,


2105
01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:12.426
and the whole business
model of what we're doing.


2106
01:43:12.426 --> 01:43:15.602
And if we do that, here's
the world we're gonna have,


2107
01:43:15.602 --> 01:43:17.914
we will be remembered
as the generation


2108
01:43:17.914 --> 01:43:21.401
that pulled ourselves
off the extinction line


2109
01:43:21.401 --> 01:43:23.368
of the Hopi prophecy
and moved on


2110
01:43:23.368 --> 01:43:24.990
to the one that goes on forever.

2111
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:37.624
Thank you all.

2112
01:43:39.798 --> 01:43:44.838
We can do it.

2113
01:43:45.045 --> 01:43:47.185
Nelson
Mandela once said,


2114
01:43:47.185 --> 01:43:51.293
"Our human compassion binds
us the one to the other,


2115
01:43:51.293 --> 01:43:53.847
not in pity or patronizingly,

2116
01:43:53.847 --> 01:43:56.746
but as human beings who
have learned how to turn


2117
01:43:56.746 --> 01:43:59.611
our common suffering into
hope for the future."


2118
01:44:02.166 --> 01:44:04.754
We have every
reason to have hope.


2119
01:44:04.754 --> 01:44:07.274
The solutions already exist.

2120
01:44:07.274 --> 01:44:10.415
If we come together
as one human family,


2121
01:44:10.415 --> 01:44:13.556
we can reclaim our lost century.
