00:01:50.628 --> 00:01:52.672
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:55.508
Good morning, dear ladies, you deadbeats!

3
00:01:55.592 --> 00:01:57.427
Wake up, lazy-ass people,

4
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.346
because the sun is already
blasting over Guaramobim.


5
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.766
Get ready, you sons of guns.
The temperature is rising.


6
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.103
The most fantastic event of our town
is upon us!


7
00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:08.146
That's right.

8
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.233
It is the long-awaited Rapadura Festival!

9
00:02:12.317 --> 00:02:14.319
Get ready. It will be amazing.

10
00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:19.699
Meanwhile, enjoy this sick forró song.
It's not like we play other genres anyway.


11
00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:33.630
Hey!

12
00:02:34.214 --> 00:02:35.632
Stop right there!

13
00:02:35.715 --> 00:02:37.342
Hands up, punk!

14
00:02:37.425 --> 00:02:38.843
BADASS COP

15
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:42.138
Not you, sir.

16
00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:51.356
Come on, man!

17
00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:56.694
Respect the police, boy!
You know you can't play here.


18
00:02:56.778 --> 00:02:58.029
Do you want to go to jail?

19
00:03:15.338 --> 00:03:17.590
Police Officer Bruceuílis Nonato.
Where did he go?


20
00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:19.676
-That way.
-This is evidence now.


21
00:03:25.348 --> 00:03:27.558
Officer Bruceuílis Nonato.
Toninho, do you copy?


22
00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:30.812
Officer Bruceuílis Nonato.
Toninho, do you copy? Toni--


23
00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:37.360
POLICE STATION

24
00:03:37.443 --> 00:03:38.611
Wake up, man!

25
00:03:55.628 --> 00:03:56.838
What are you--

26
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:58.631
Out of the way, ma'am!

27
00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:17.692
-Let's go!
-I--


28
00:04:17.775 --> 00:04:20.611
You have the right to remain silent, punk!

29
00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:24.699
Anything you say will be used against you.

30
00:04:24.782 --> 00:04:27.785
-I ain't no criminal, man!
-Why did you run away?


31
00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:31.414
You looked at me. I looked at you.
You ran, and I got scared!


32
00:04:31.497 --> 00:04:33.416
What were you doing in that house?

33
00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:36.294
I will kill him!

34
00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:37.962
It's not what it seems!

35
00:04:38.046 --> 00:04:40.256
Jesus Christ. Let's go!

36
00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.342
You stole a fan? 
What the hell?

37
00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:45.511
-I'll kill this bastard!
-He's just my cousin, babe!


38
00:04:58.983 --> 00:05:02.403
Calm down, guys.
Everything is under control. It's cool.


39
00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:04.364
Watch it.

40
00:05:04.447 --> 00:05:05.865
Stay, my ass.

41
00:05:05.948 --> 00:05:09.369
I won't share a cell
with this piece of crap.


42
00:05:09.452 --> 00:05:11.871
Your wife thinks I'm pretty fine, okay?

43
00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:15.416
You might as well leave me here

44
00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.795
because I'm considering
committing a homicide.


45
00:05:18.878 --> 00:05:20.171
Using your horns?

46
00:05:21.381 --> 00:05:24.425
Wait! Wait a minute!

47
00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.638
I assure you everything will be resolved
as soon as possible.


48
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:30.473
You have my word.

49
00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:35.561
Bruceuílis Nonato, you idiot!

50
00:05:35.645 --> 00:05:38.314
-Oh crap!
-Chief Vitória Regina.


51
00:05:38.398 --> 00:05:40.316
Breaking and entering,

52
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.984
disorderly conduct,

53
00:05:42.068 --> 00:05:44.028
destruction of public property,

54
00:05:44.112 --> 00:05:46.030
meddling in other people's lives…

55
00:05:46.114 --> 00:05:50.618
I've had it up to here with you!
What am I gonna do with you, Bruce?


56
00:05:50.701 --> 00:05:53.204
I caught the guy that stole the fan.

57
00:05:53.287 --> 00:05:55.957
I just took this old fan

58
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.543
because it's very hot at his house.

59
00:05:58.626 --> 00:06:00.711
There's no window!

60
00:06:00.795 --> 00:06:03.172
-Put it on high speed, please.
-High?


61
00:06:03.256 --> 00:06:05.383
-Now look, if you--
-Quiet!


62
00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:07.468
I want you both in my office now!

63
00:06:12.223 --> 00:06:16.686
Next week we'll have
the 30th Guaramobim Rapadura Festival.


64
00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:18.896
The world's most famous rapadura festival.

65
00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.982
-Is there another one?
-I'm aware, chief.


66
00:06:21.065 --> 00:06:23.401
The security detail is set up.

67
00:06:23.484 --> 00:06:25.987
-You won't be part of it, Bruce.
-What?


68
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:30.074
-I'm responsible for the event's security.
-No. Toninho will take care of it.


69
00:06:30.158 --> 00:06:30.992
Toninho?

70
00:06:31.534 --> 00:06:33.953
He isn't qualified for the job.

71
00:06:34.036 --> 00:06:35.496
I have to agree with Bruce.

72
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.832
Toninho may be stupid,

73
00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:40.168
weak, he may be lazy,

74
00:06:40.251 --> 00:06:43.087
ugly, he may have those flappy ears,

75
00:06:43.171 --> 00:06:44.922
but at least he does what I say.

76
00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:47.008
I must agree with the chief.

77
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:49.844
You're gonna punish me
because I saw suspicious activity


78
00:06:49.927 --> 00:06:51.220
and acted accordingly?

79
00:06:51.304 --> 00:06:52.805
Suspicious activity…

80
00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.640
Suspicious activity, my ass!

81
00:06:54.724 --> 00:06:56.517
Give me a break.

82
00:06:57.143 --> 00:06:59.312
Ever seen anything suspicious, Toninho?

83
00:06:59.395 --> 00:07:03.608
I saw a UFO once,
but it was just a São João fire lantern.


84
00:07:03.691 --> 00:07:06.611
See? Nothing happens around here, Bruce.

85
00:07:06.694 --> 00:07:10.573
In this town, if a guy slaps someone,
they name a square after him.


86
00:07:10.656 --> 00:07:12.325
Yeah, unfortunately.

87
00:07:13.618 --> 00:07:15.453
But I do have another mission for you.

88
00:07:17.788 --> 00:07:18.873
Now we're talking!

89
00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:25.755
Your mission is to take care of Celestina
until the festival.


90
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:27.757
Are you crazy or high?

91
00:07:28.674 --> 00:07:30.843
I've never seen a cop babysit a goat.

92
00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:33.638
Bruce, Celestina is a city treasure.

93
00:07:33.721 --> 00:07:36.098
She was even elected city counselor
last year.


94
00:07:37.183 --> 00:07:40.603
Bruce, you know folks here
love this goat, right?


95
00:07:40.686 --> 00:07:42.563
So she is your responsibility now.

96
00:07:42.647 --> 00:07:45.316
I want to see
her all primped and preened,

97
00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:48.194
smelling good, clean, and well-fed.

98
00:07:48.277 --> 00:07:50.613
You can start with a bath. Here.

99
00:07:53.241 --> 00:07:55.618
People will say I'm a goat caregiver now.

100
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.412
That's what I get
for trying to be a real cop.


101
00:08:12.552 --> 00:08:15.638
Gather round, everybody.
I won't say it twice.


102
00:08:15.721 --> 00:08:16.806
OPERATION THUNDERBOLT

103
00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:20.977
The target of today's operation
is a man known as Ping Li.


104
00:08:21.477 --> 00:08:24.230
Our sources say
Ping Li has been negotiating


105
00:08:24.313 --> 00:08:27.024
a drug transaction for months

106
00:08:27.108 --> 00:08:29.819
with our biggest target,
the drug dealer known as…


107
00:08:29.902 --> 00:08:30.736
WHO IS HE?

108
00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.988
…White Glove.

109
00:08:32.071 --> 00:08:35.241
We must catch Ping Li
if we want to get to White Glove.


110
00:08:35.324 --> 00:08:36.284
But beware.

111
00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:41.163
These men are considered unstable
and highly dangerous.


112
00:08:41.872 --> 00:08:45.626
Alpha team will guard this area.

113
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:49.422
Beta team will guard the west area exit.

114
00:08:49.505 --> 00:08:52.508
If it was up to me,
you know I'd go in guns blazing,


115
00:08:52.592 --> 00:08:56.304
but, for legal reasons,
we still cannot do that,


116
00:08:56.387 --> 00:08:58.931
so we must catch them red-handed.

117
00:08:59.015 --> 00:09:02.268
That's why two of our men

118
00:09:02.351 --> 00:09:07.398
will infiltrate as drug dealers
working for White Glove.


119
00:09:07.481 --> 00:09:09.859
So on the firing line,

120
00:09:09.942 --> 00:09:12.069
we'll have Caíque

121
00:09:12.153 --> 00:09:13.529
and Trindade.

122
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:18.743
What now, Trindade?

123
00:09:24.624 --> 00:09:28.002
DESK
-DUTY COP

124
00:09:28.085 --> 00:09:31.005
I think I should stay
at the police station.


125
00:09:31.088 --> 00:09:34.133
I can continue organizing
the operations board.


126
00:09:34.967 --> 00:09:36.052
It's good, isn't it?

127
00:09:36.135 --> 00:09:38.846
I went to Kalunga,
the stationery supplies are on sale!


128
00:09:39.347 --> 00:09:43.392
I can also rearrange the board,
change the fonts--


129
00:09:43.476 --> 00:09:44.518
Dismissed.

130
00:09:44.602 --> 00:09:46.646
-Let's do this.
-Let's go.


131
00:09:47.313 --> 00:09:50.733
Are you trying to give up
now that we're all set?


132
00:09:52.151 --> 00:09:55.029
I'm just not that comfortable
with the plan.


133
00:09:55.112 --> 00:09:57.657
I mean,
there's nothing wrong with the plan…


134
00:09:58.824 --> 00:10:02.078
I just don't like the part
where I need to be part of it.


135
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:06.040
Unfortunately, we need you, Trindade.

136
00:10:06.123 --> 00:10:07.124
Are you sure?

137
00:10:07.208 --> 00:10:10.086
Because, you know,
I'm like the office guy.


138
00:10:10.169 --> 00:10:12.046
Did you look in the mirror today?

139
00:10:12.963 --> 00:10:14.006
Shall we do it again?

140
00:10:15.466 --> 00:10:18.219
-What do you see?
-The brain of the operation?


141
00:10:18.302 --> 00:10:19.970
A weak and tired man.

142
00:10:20.054 --> 00:10:23.307
The opposite of every cop
in this police station.


143
00:10:24.642 --> 00:10:25.643
Caíque.

144
00:10:32.274 --> 00:10:33.109
Roger.

145
00:10:33.609 --> 00:10:36.278
OFFICER CAÍQUE
REAL COP


146
00:10:36.362 --> 00:10:37.279
Come here.

147
00:10:39.115 --> 00:10:39.949
Captain?

148
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.452
Check out Caíque's physique.

149
00:10:44.704 --> 00:10:47.832
Do you think
Caíque could pass for a drug dealer?


150
00:10:47.915 --> 00:10:48.874
Negative, Captain.

151
00:10:49.375 --> 00:10:52.002
My body type doesn't match
that of criminals.


152
00:10:52.503 --> 00:10:54.380
I'm too strong for that, okay?

153
00:10:54.463 --> 00:10:55.339
Exactly.

154
00:10:55.423 --> 00:10:59.885
That's why you're going to feel
Caíque's biceps.


155
00:10:59.969 --> 00:11:01.429
-What?
-Biceps, Caíque!


156
00:11:04.306 --> 00:11:05.766
Check his Pão de Açúcar.

157
00:11:06.267 --> 00:11:07.101
Touch it.

158
00:11:07.852 --> 00:11:09.979
Those are a cop's biceps.

159
00:11:10.563 --> 00:11:13.232
-Now, feel his six-pack.
-No, it's not necess--


160
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:17.903
When a criminal looks at a guy like him,
what does he think?


161
00:11:18.404 --> 00:11:19.947
-Police?
-Police!


162
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.700
-And when he looks at you?
-The brain of the--


163
00:11:22.783 --> 00:11:23.951
Scumbag!

164
00:11:24.034 --> 00:11:26.537
A loser, a lost cause.

165
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:29.165
-Living with his grandma.
-I moved out two months ago.


166
00:11:29.248 --> 00:11:33.210
And that's why
we need you to go with Caíque.


167
00:11:33.294 --> 00:11:34.795
To balance things out.

168
00:11:35.963 --> 00:11:37.506
I need you, Trindade.

169
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.967
You'll be my shield.

170
00:11:40.468 --> 00:11:41.844
What do you mean, "shield"?

171
00:11:43.888 --> 00:11:46.682
-Operation Thunderbolt!
-Thunderbolt!


172
00:11:47.433 --> 00:11:48.851
Thunderbolt.

173
00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:16.921
Get in position. 
You're good to go.

174
00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:39.527
I'm not comfortable with this disguise.

175
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:43.823
-What's wrong with it?
-It says "human target" on my chest.


176
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:48.160
It's my brother's rock band.
It's alternative, protest rock, you know?


177
00:12:48.244 --> 00:12:49.703
Just bass and a horn blowing.

178
00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:51.872
Yeah, but why this name?

179
00:12:52.414 --> 00:12:53.958
You know what, Trindade?

180
00:12:54.041 --> 00:12:56.544
You don't support
the Brazilian indie scene.


181
00:12:56.627 --> 00:12:59.964
You're into mainstream, arena rock bands
that suck on the government tits.


182
00:13:00.047 --> 00:13:01.298
-That's it.
-That's not it!


183
00:13:01.382 --> 00:13:02.216
Then what?

184
00:13:02.883 --> 00:13:05.344
There is a target on my chest!

185
00:13:06.011 --> 00:13:09.139
My nephew drew that, man.
The kid is disabled.


186
00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:11.600
He draws with his foot.
God, show some respect.


187
00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:14.353
Now, get into the character.

188
00:13:15.104 --> 00:13:17.857
Just like me. Pay attention. I'm a cop.

189
00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.859
And bam. Now I'm a thug.

190
00:13:21.694 --> 00:13:22.528
Come on.

191
00:13:49.054 --> 00:13:50.639
Where is Ping Li, dude?

192
00:14:07.197 --> 00:14:09.366
-Can we get straight to business?
-Sure.


193
00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.578
-God, let's hurry up already.
-Don't blow your disguise.


194
00:14:12.661 --> 00:14:15.122
No! I'm not in a hurry or anything.

195
00:14:15.205 --> 00:14:17.458
I learned to be patient doing my time

196
00:14:17.541 --> 00:14:20.753
when I got arrested for dealing drugs.

197
00:14:20.836 --> 00:14:22.880
-Hard drugs.
-Tone it down.


198
00:14:22.963 --> 00:14:25.633
Actually,
it was just contraband cigarettes,


199
00:14:25.716 --> 00:14:26.800
non-alcoholic beer--

200
00:14:26.884 --> 00:14:29.011
-It's too light now.
-Crack!


201
00:14:29.094 --> 00:14:30.804
I'm addicted to crack!

202
00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:33.933
Don't screw it up, please.

203
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.896
But only socially.
On Sundays, after lunch.


204
00:14:38.979 --> 00:14:41.398
So, what about the product?

205
00:14:43.943 --> 00:14:44.985
Money first.

206
00:14:46.278 --> 00:14:47.112
Not you.

207
00:14:48.238 --> 00:14:49.239
The junkie.

208
00:15:36.203 --> 00:15:38.330
-Where did you serve time?
-What?


209
00:15:38.414 --> 00:15:40.541
You said you did time. Where was it?

210
00:15:42.918 --> 00:15:43.836
Bangu.

211
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:46.880
Which unit?

212
00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:49.967
Seven.

213
00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.178
Bangu 7 is a women's prison.

214
00:15:54.013 --> 00:15:54.847
Shit.

215
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.141
My name was Simone back then.

216
00:16:00.185 --> 00:16:01.186
Shit.

217
00:16:47.191 --> 00:16:48.358
That was close.

218
00:16:48.442 --> 00:16:50.694
Guys, I'm here! I'm alive!

219
00:16:55.574 --> 00:16:56.575
He will be fine.

220
00:17:00.704 --> 00:17:04.083
Plane without wings

221
00:17:04.917 --> 00:17:07.336
Bonfire without embers

222
00:17:07.878 --> 00:17:12.800
I'm like this without you

223
00:17:14.093 --> 00:17:17.137
Football without a ball

224
00:17:17.221 --> 00:17:19.765
Tweety without Sylvester

225
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:24.394
I'm like this without you

226
00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.733
I count the hours
so I can see you

227
00:17:29.817 --> 00:17:34.947
But the clock is wrong for me…

228
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:38.075
FAREWELL FROM YOUR THUNDERBOLT TEAM

229
00:17:38.742 --> 00:17:42.371
Why?

230
00:17:50.879 --> 00:17:51.797
Priscila?

231
00:17:53.298 --> 00:17:54.216
Priscila?

232
00:17:55.342 --> 00:17:56.260
Priscila?

233
00:18:00.806 --> 00:18:03.517
-I know you're a little upset--
-A little?


234
00:18:04.351 --> 00:18:07.855
Couldn't you take some bullets
to try and save your partner?


235
00:18:08.647 --> 00:18:10.941
I'd have gotten shot
if I didn't dodge, right?


236
00:18:11.024 --> 00:18:14.319
Every real cop has taken at least
three bullets to protect a partner.


237
00:18:14.987 --> 00:18:16.822
-How many have you taken?
-None.


238
00:18:16.905 --> 00:18:18.699
-That's why I'm alive, right?
-No.


239
00:18:19.199 --> 00:18:21.743
That's why you'll pack your stuff.

240
00:18:21.827 --> 00:18:24.663
Effective immediately,
you're going to another district.


241
00:18:26.623 --> 00:18:27.457
But…

242
00:18:29.168 --> 00:18:30.460
I am a Thunderbolt.

243
00:18:31.253 --> 00:18:32.838
Thunderbolt, yeah!

244
00:18:32.921 --> 00:18:36.466
You've never been
and will never be worthy of this team.


245
00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:09.625
Come on, Celestina.

246
00:19:11.793 --> 00:19:15.255
Hey! Celestina! Here we go!

247
00:19:15.339 --> 00:19:18.383
Once I started chasing a criminal

248
00:19:19.176 --> 00:19:20.969
who was twice as tall as me.

249
00:19:21.053 --> 00:19:21.887
Howdy.

250
00:19:22.763 --> 00:19:23.931
I'm taking care of her.

251
00:19:25.766 --> 00:19:26.683
Feeling hot?

252
00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.978
I looked him in the eyes.

253
00:19:30.062 --> 00:19:33.232
Once he saw,
he came for me, and I went for him,


254
00:19:33.315 --> 00:19:36.360
but when I thought I had him,
he hit me first.


255
00:19:36.443 --> 00:19:39.947
Hey, respect the police.

256
00:19:44.534 --> 00:19:45.369
I win!

257
00:19:45.994 --> 00:19:49.289
Stay here, Celestina, okay?
Daddy will be right back.


258
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:51.917
Guard the door and don't let anybody in.

259
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.876
Stay.

260
00:20:03.303 --> 00:20:04.429
Where is Celestina?

261
00:20:05.555 --> 00:20:06.473
Celestina?

262
00:20:08.392 --> 00:20:09.518
This goat…

263
00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:12.646
Such a piece of work. Celestina!

264
00:20:14.147 --> 00:20:15.107
Celestina!

265
00:20:16.608 --> 00:20:17.526
Celestina!

266
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.324
Celestina!

267
00:20:25.492 --> 00:20:26.451
Celestina!

268
00:20:27.494 --> 00:20:30.622
This is not a job
for an experienced cop like me.


269
00:20:31.123 --> 00:20:32.082
Celestina?

270
00:20:36.586 --> 00:20:37.629
Of course.

271
00:20:38.171 --> 00:20:39.423
She smelled the rapadura.

272
00:20:41.049 --> 00:20:44.636
It's just a flat tire.
I'll be in São Paulo tomorrow.


273
00:20:46.513 --> 00:20:49.308
Where do I find him? Shintan?

274
00:20:50.684 --> 00:20:52.394
Hey, buddy! Do you need help?

275
00:20:53.145 --> 00:20:54.354
Jesus Christ!

276
00:20:57.858 --> 00:20:59.318
I'll call you right back.

277
00:21:02.612 --> 00:21:03.822
No, it's all set.

278
00:21:04.406 --> 00:21:05.324
Right.

279
00:21:06.283 --> 00:21:07.784
You're not from here, are you?

280
00:21:08.577 --> 00:21:11.455
-You're far from São Paulo.
-I'm not from here or São Paulo.


281
00:21:13.332 --> 00:21:14.708
I'm sorry,

282
00:21:15.208 --> 00:21:18.337
but I think my goat, Celestina,
got into your truck.


283
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.588
She loves rapadura.

284
00:21:22.632 --> 00:21:25.635
Oh man!
She ate an entire bar all by herself.


285
00:21:25.719 --> 00:21:27.637
But don't you worry. 
How much is it?

286
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.724
No. There's no need. It's alright.

287
00:21:30.807 --> 00:21:33.352
No, I insist. Make it two. Ten reais?

288
00:21:33.435 --> 00:21:35.479
It's not for sale. 
It's all mine.

289
00:21:35.562 --> 00:21:38.732
You do love rapadura, don't you?
That's a two-year supply.


290
00:21:38.815 --> 00:21:40.901
Listen, can I see the load paperwork?

291
00:21:40.984 --> 00:21:43.070
-It's my scar, isn't it?
-Scar?


292
00:21:44.654 --> 00:21:46.615
What scar? I don't see any scar.

293
00:21:46.698 --> 00:21:49.034
My whole life,
I've been told I look like a criminal.


294
00:21:49.117 --> 00:21:50.369
I am sorry, you know…

295
00:21:50.994 --> 00:21:53.205
Cops always have to be on alert.

296
00:21:53.288 --> 00:21:55.916
-On alert for asking for documents?
-Yes, documents.


297
00:21:56.541 --> 00:21:59.336
-Here's the document. Lie down.
-Really?


298
00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:03.048
Pointing a gun at a cop?
So much for not looking like a criminal.


299
00:22:03.131 --> 00:22:05.133
-Lie down, man.
-I'm not sleepy.


300
00:22:05.217 --> 00:22:06.927
I'll put you to sleep, then.

301
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.597
I'm getting sleepy now. I'll lie down.
Just a little sleepy.


302
00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.475
Lie down, facing the ground.

303
00:22:13.558 --> 00:22:14.393
Face down.

304
00:22:14.476 --> 00:22:17.062
GIMME MOAR RAPADURA

305
00:22:17.145 --> 00:22:18.480
Don't look up.

306
00:22:24.861 --> 00:22:26.446
Celestina! Celestina!

307
00:22:28.198 --> 00:22:29.574
Son of a gun!

308
00:22:29.658 --> 00:22:32.661
I got his plate. 
I'll follow him to hell!

309
00:22:34.287 --> 00:22:35.455
Reelect Zeca Brito.

310
00:22:36.248 --> 00:22:38.708
Zeca Brito for federal deputy.

311
00:22:39.292 --> 00:22:42.254
This is our federal deputy, Zeca Brito.

312
00:22:42.337 --> 00:22:46.133
-Don't you want me to go with you?
-I must carry this burden by myself.


313
00:22:46.216 --> 00:22:47.050
BUS TICKETS

314
00:22:47.134 --> 00:22:49.761
If we go together,
the chief will find out I lost Celestina.


315
00:22:49.845 --> 00:22:52.514
For God's sake,
São Paulo is very dangerous.


316
00:22:52.597 --> 00:22:54.558
All my cousins there became criminals.

317
00:22:54.641 --> 00:22:56.935
Don't worry. I will be fine.

318
00:22:57.018 --> 00:22:59.146
Did you get the
address I asked you for?

319
00:22:59.229 --> 00:23:02.274
-It was hard, but I got it.
-Let me write it down.


320
00:23:05.527 --> 00:23:08.113
I'll find the Gimme Moar Rapadura truck.

321
00:23:08.196 --> 00:23:11.533
I'll rescue the goat
and prove my worth to this town.


322
00:23:12.284 --> 00:23:13.743
You'll die on the first day!

323
00:23:13.827 --> 00:23:15.036
What the hell, man?

324
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.997
If not shot, you'll
get hit by a car.

325
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:21.168
And if the car doesn't kill you,
then the pollution will do the trick.


326
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:23.712
Then you'll think,
"I just need some water."


327
00:23:23.795 --> 00:23:25.755
They don't have water! 
It's all gone.

328
00:23:25.839 --> 00:23:29.634
Not to mention dengue fever, yellow fever,
typhoid, erysipelas,


329
00:23:29.718 --> 00:23:32.262
some kind of itch that causes chills.

330
00:23:32.345 --> 00:23:34.806
Are you crazy, man?
And there's too many people.


331
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:36.808
-It's not like this!
-Calm down!


332
00:23:36.892 --> 00:23:39.728
I've been to a big city.
I've even been to Sobral before.


333
00:23:39.811 --> 00:23:41.938
In my absence,
you'll have to take care of Guará.


334
00:23:42.022 --> 00:23:43.523
The town is in your hands.

335
00:23:44.983 --> 00:23:47.235
And I'll be back for the festival,
you hear me?


336
00:23:49.196 --> 00:23:51.656
May God and the
Holy Spirit be with you!

337
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.367
Bye! Safe travels!

338
00:23:55.410 --> 00:23:56.912
He won't last two days.

339
00:24:04.503 --> 00:24:08.548
YOU ARE LEAVING GUARAMOBIM
GOOD LUCK!


340
00:24:31.488 --> 00:24:33.907
TIETÊ BUS STATION
WELCOME TO SÃO PAULO


341
00:24:39.162 --> 00:24:44.584
DEPARTMENT OF SEIZED VEHICLES

342
00:25:59.034 --> 00:26:03.079
We'll have a barbecue in honor of Caíque
at Miúdo's place, okay?


343
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.248
Cheer up, guys.

344
00:26:10.754 --> 00:26:12.297
Why the hell are you calling

345
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.590
my personal number?

346
00:26:13.673 --> 00:26:15.050
Priscila, listen.

347
00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.302
A burglar broke into my office.

348
00:26:17.385 --> 00:26:19.763
I repeat, a burglar broke

349
00:26:19.846 --> 00:26:21.431
into my office!

350
00:26:21.514 --> 00:26:23.683
Are you calling the police

351
00:26:23.767 --> 00:26:26.102
to arrest somebody
who's in the police station?


352
00:26:26.186 --> 00:26:28.063
But he's evil-looking.

353
00:26:28.563 --> 00:26:29.648
Tall, strong,

354
00:26:29.731 --> 00:26:31.024
he's like Caíque.

355
00:26:31.107 --> 00:26:33.485
-Sweetie, is he dead?
-No!


356
00:26:33.568 --> 00:26:35.904
Then he's not Caíque, okay?

357
00:26:35.987 --> 00:26:36.905
Piece of shit.

358
00:26:53.922 --> 00:26:55.840
Why didn't you say you are a cop?

359
00:26:55.924 --> 00:26:59.302
You came at me all crazy,
spraying that in my face.


360
00:26:59.386 --> 00:27:01.680
I thought you were a burglar.

361
00:27:01.763 --> 00:27:03.890
It's really dangerous in this city.

362
00:27:03.973 --> 00:27:06.893
Even cops get robbed? Toninho warned me.

363
00:27:07.394 --> 00:27:09.104
Police Officer Bruceuílis Nonato.

364
00:27:09.187 --> 00:27:10.897
Renato Trindade.

365
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.482
-Are you from here?
-Negative.


366
00:27:12.565 --> 00:27:15.735
I'm from the first and only district
of Guaramobim, Ceará.


367
00:27:15.819 --> 00:27:19.322
But we call it Guará, not to be confused
with Guaraciaba do Norte.


368
00:27:20.115 --> 00:27:22.200
But it doesn't work.
They also call it Guará.


369
00:27:22.283 --> 00:27:23.535
And you came from Guará to…

370
00:27:25.328 --> 00:27:26.955
-Which Guará?
-Your Guará.


371
00:27:27.038 --> 00:27:30.333
Right. I came all the way here
because a truck was stolen.


372
00:27:30.417 --> 00:27:32.001
-And here I am.
-Hold on.


373
00:27:32.502 --> 00:27:36.339
For every five vehicles stolen
in São Paulo, only two are recovered.


374
00:27:36.423 --> 00:27:37.924
In one piece, just one.

375
00:27:38.007 --> 00:27:38.842
Oh man!

376
00:27:38.925 --> 00:27:41.594
When it comes to kidnapping,
how many are recovered, like,


377
00:27:41.678 --> 00:27:42.512
in one piece?

378
00:27:48.685 --> 00:27:50.770
-Why?
-I'm not worried about the vehicle.


379
00:27:50.854 --> 00:27:53.898
I'm worried about Celestina.
She was inside the vehicle.


380
00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:55.942
Celestina?

381
00:27:57.652 --> 00:27:59.863
A truck similar to the one you described

382
00:27:59.946 --> 00:28:01.823
got a ticket near the city center.

383
00:28:01.906 --> 00:28:04.451
That's it. The Gimme Moar Rapadura truck.

384
00:28:04.534 --> 00:28:06.494
They were looking for someone
called Chitão.


385
00:28:06.578 --> 00:28:09.414
Look, I believe
that using the CCTV footage,


386
00:28:09.497 --> 00:28:12.751
we can trace its trajectory
and find out where it is.


387
00:28:12.834 --> 00:28:16.421
I'm just worried about
what they might do to her.


388
00:28:18.381 --> 00:28:20.508
-Is Celestina your daughter?
-No.


389
00:28:21.134 --> 00:28:24.220
She has no father and no mother.
Not even a birth certificate.


390
00:28:24.304 --> 00:28:26.681
She goes from house to house.

391
00:28:26.765 --> 00:28:28.850
My God. How old is she?

392
00:28:28.933 --> 00:28:31.811
She is about five, six years old.

393
00:28:31.895 --> 00:28:34.063
She's the gloomy type, born with worms.

394
00:28:34.981 --> 00:28:35.940
I'm so sorry.

395
00:28:37.108 --> 00:28:38.318
What does she look like?

396
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.780
Pure white. She is always dressed up.

397
00:28:41.863 --> 00:28:44.783
But she's very naive.
I'm afraid they might hurt her.


398
00:28:45.533 --> 00:28:47.577
Don't worry. We'll find her, okay?

399
00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.079
We will. There!

400
00:28:50.163 --> 00:28:52.207
The truck was last seen in Liberdade.

401
00:28:53.166 --> 00:28:54.709
-Is it far from here?
-Not really.


402
00:28:54.793 --> 00:28:58.421
Just take the Glicério 277 bus
in front of the station.


403
00:29:00.423 --> 00:29:03.551
Can't you come along?
I'm afraid I'll get lost in São Paulo.


404
00:29:04.344 --> 00:29:08.807
No, I can't.
I have a lot of paperwork to take care of.


405
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:10.391
Right.

406
00:29:11.351 --> 00:29:13.645
I hope they don't kill her
before I get there.


407
00:29:38.378 --> 00:29:40.880
It's so far. We should've come by car.

408
00:29:40.964 --> 00:29:42.090
My car was stolen.

409
00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:44.217
And the police car?

410
00:29:44.801 --> 00:29:45.802
Precisely.

411
00:29:45.885 --> 00:29:48.388
The police car was stolen
while I was on duty.


412
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:51.391
I am not very lucky with those things.

413
00:29:51.474 --> 00:29:53.852
How did they rob an armed policeman?

414
00:29:53.935 --> 00:29:56.354
I'm not armed. 
I trust my brain.

415
00:29:57.522 --> 00:29:58.690
You're just like me.

416
00:29:58.773 --> 00:30:00.525
-I don't carry a gun either.
-Really?


417
00:30:00.608 --> 00:30:02.110
I am my own weapon.

418
00:30:07.115 --> 00:30:09.742
Don't be rude, man!
Give the lady your seat.


419
00:30:10.285 --> 00:30:12.495
Look at her. She's on her last legs.

420
00:30:13.204 --> 00:30:14.038
Thank you.

421
00:30:16.082 --> 00:30:17.250
My pleasure, ma'am.

422
00:30:18.626 --> 00:30:20.920
Is Bruce Willis your real name?

423
00:30:21.004 --> 00:30:22.589
Yes, it's a single word.

424
00:30:22.672 --> 00:30:25.174
My father was crazy about action movies.

425
00:30:25.258 --> 00:30:27.635
My siblings' names are Chuquinorris,

426
00:30:27.719 --> 00:30:29.512
Charlisbronso,

427
00:30:29.596 --> 00:30:30.680
and Vandami.

428
00:30:30.763 --> 00:30:32.724
-And the little one is Mel.
-Melissa?


429
00:30:32.807 --> 00:30:34.267
No, Melgibsa.

430
00:30:39.188 --> 00:30:42.317
Don't be rude!
Give your seat to that old lady.


431
00:30:42.901 --> 00:30:44.736
That poor thing is about to die.

432
00:30:45.987 --> 00:30:48.531
You still have some juice. Sit, ma'am.

433
00:30:49.324 --> 00:30:53.036
Don't take it personally.
These São Paulo folks are ill-bred.


434
00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:54.913
-Clueless.
-It's true.


435
00:31:03.087 --> 00:31:04.130
How much longer?

436
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.891
Man, São Paulo is really big, isn't it?

437
00:31:14.974 --> 00:31:16.434
Even China would fit in here.

438
00:31:16.976 --> 00:31:19.395
It won't be easy
to find that truck here.

439
00:31:19.479 --> 00:31:20.605
Have some faith, man.

440
00:31:21.147 --> 00:31:23.066
I have a sketch of the criminal.

441
00:31:23.608 --> 00:31:26.110
-Will that help?
-Of course! Why didn't you say so?


442
00:31:26.819 --> 00:31:28.363
Described and drawn by me.

443
00:31:29.364 --> 00:31:30.198
Perfect.

444
00:31:34.118 --> 00:31:34.953
Bruce,

445
00:31:35.745 --> 00:31:38.456
what was the name
you heard the suspect saying?


446
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.459
Chitão. He was looking
for someone called Chitão.


447
00:31:41.542 --> 00:31:44.295
What if he was talking about that place?

448
00:31:49.342 --> 00:31:52.261
Right, Shintan.
Shintan means "Chitão" in Chinese.


449
00:31:52.887 --> 00:31:54.681
-Let's go.
-Just like that?


450
00:31:54.764 --> 00:31:56.432
I'm going to ask if they've seen him.

451
00:31:56.516 --> 00:31:59.852
Are you crazy?
It's full of Chinese men, kung fu experts.


452
00:31:59.936 --> 00:32:01.688
-You think so?
-Trust me.


453
00:32:02.188 --> 00:32:04.315
They kill people with a one-punch.

454
00:32:05.191 --> 00:32:07.443
-A punch?
-No, a one-punch.


455
00:32:07.527 --> 00:32:08.778
Right in the throat.

456
00:32:09.737 --> 00:32:11.698
We better call for backup, then.

457
00:32:11.781 --> 00:32:12.865
Why backup?

458
00:32:13.783 --> 00:32:16.327
Trust me. I know some Chinese. Come on.

459
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:35.304
What the heck, man?

460
00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.141
-Aren't you Chinese?
-No, I'm from Juazeiro.


461
00:32:38.933 --> 00:32:41.853
-Are there any Chinese people here?
-No, we're all from Ceará.


462
00:32:41.936 --> 00:32:43.688
That one is from Camocim,

463
00:32:43.771 --> 00:32:45.898
Quixadá, Ipaumirim, Pereiro,

464
00:32:45.982 --> 00:32:46.941
Senador Pompeu.

465
00:32:47.025 --> 00:32:48.735
That snob there is from Guará.

466
00:32:48.818 --> 00:32:50.069
Guará? Which Guará?

467
00:32:50.153 --> 00:32:51.279
Guaraciaba do Norte.

468
00:32:51.362 --> 00:32:52.530
Yikes.

469
00:32:53.114 --> 00:32:54.490
By any chance…

470
00:32:56.909 --> 00:32:58.202
have you seen this man?

471
00:32:58.286 --> 00:33:01.706
I see so many people in here
that I may have forgotten


472
00:33:02.206 --> 00:33:03.291
that I've seen him.

473
00:33:03.374 --> 00:33:05.710
That's not how you do it.
Give me five bucks.


474
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:08.546
Not sure I have five bucks. Here.

475
00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:10.006
That'll do.

476
00:33:11.466 --> 00:33:15.386
Perhaps my monkey friend
might help you refresh your memory.


477
00:33:16.679 --> 00:33:18.848
Are you sure you didn't see the guy?

478
00:33:18.931 --> 00:33:20.266
Yes, I'm sure.

479
00:33:21.392 --> 00:33:23.978
-I didn't see him.
-He's tough. Give me another one.


480
00:33:27.899 --> 00:33:28.858
What about now?

481
00:33:29.567 --> 00:33:31.194
-Do you remember?
-I do.


482
00:33:32.445 --> 00:33:33.529
I didn't see him.

483
00:33:33.613 --> 00:33:34.697
Give me fifty bucks.

484
00:33:34.781 --> 00:33:37.575
I'm out of cash. 
Do you take coupons?

485
00:33:37.658 --> 00:33:42.455
You can increase the bribe all you want,
and I'll keep saying I didn't see him


486
00:33:42.538 --> 00:33:44.373
because I really didn't see him.

487
00:33:44.457 --> 00:33:47.085
-So I can have my money back, right?
-I'll take that.


488
00:33:48.086 --> 00:33:50.546
I'll handle it. Stay out of it.
Give me a bottle of cachaça.


489
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:51.506
Can it be saké?

490
00:33:51.589 --> 00:33:53.966
Anything. I'll drink whatever you have.

491
00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.677
-Are you going to drink?
-Calm down, man.


492
00:33:56.761 --> 00:34:00.014
I'm just mingling.
The bottle is just a cover.


493
00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:01.849
Hey, don't be stingy.

494
00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:04.977
I'm going to the restroom.

495
00:34:06.562 --> 00:34:07.772
Ma'am, the restroom?

496
00:34:29.043 --> 00:34:31.045
-Hi! Can I get you anything?
-No.


497
00:34:31.546 --> 00:34:34.132
-We are on duty.
-Chill, man. So am I.


498
00:34:34.215 --> 00:34:35.091
I'm also on duty.

499
00:34:35.174 --> 00:34:37.301
The saké is on me. Three more.

500
00:34:48.229 --> 00:34:51.232
I'm opening it. Rapadura is fucking hard.

501
00:34:53.484 --> 00:34:54.861
I'm opening it. Let me…

502
00:34:57.238 --> 00:34:58.865
Of course I'll let him taste it.

503
00:35:01.492 --> 00:35:04.328
The product is here. 
I'm waiting for him.

504
00:35:04.412 --> 00:35:06.164
GIMME MOAR RAPADURA

505
00:35:07.248 --> 00:35:10.585
I'll give him a sample
of the coke to try.

506
00:35:17.967 --> 00:35:21.512
She ate the rapadura, man.

507
00:35:22.013 --> 00:35:25.725
The product is inside her.
So far, it hasn't come out naturally.


508
00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:30.313
Poor child.
First worms, now drugs in her belly.


509
00:35:30.396 --> 00:35:33.399
If you want,
I can make an incision in her tummy.


510
00:35:34.275 --> 00:35:38.070
Then the dude said he ran away
with the fan because he was hot.


511
00:35:38.154 --> 00:35:41.407
Can you imagine him taking the fan
from his lover's house?


512
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.451
Stay with me, Bloodsport!

513
00:35:43.534 --> 00:35:45.953
-Bruce!
-Calm down, man.


514
00:35:46.037 --> 00:35:49.081
This is Trindade, my partner.
These are my new friends, Old Fashion,


515
00:35:49.165 --> 00:35:52.585
Shorty, and Penguin-
- Big Win?

516
00:35:52.668 --> 00:35:54.295
-Pink Green?
-Ping Li.


517
00:35:54.795 --> 00:35:56.339
Hey! So you know each other?

518
00:35:56.422 --> 00:35:59.342
And people say São
Paulo is big? Come on.

519
00:35:59.425 --> 00:36:02.887
Your friends are drug dealers
wanted by the police, they are dangerous,


520
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:04.347
and they killed a cop.

521
00:36:07.141 --> 00:36:08.643
Good luck, man.

522
00:36:13.356 --> 00:36:15.483
Dear mother of God, don't leave me.

523
00:36:21.364 --> 00:36:22.531
Celestina!

524
00:36:23.616 --> 00:36:24.867
Where is the kid?

525
00:36:25.368 --> 00:36:27.370
What kid? That is Celestina!

526
00:36:28.955 --> 00:36:30.498
Celestina is a damn goat?

527
00:36:30.581 --> 00:36:32.333
Don't underrate her, man.

528
00:36:32.416 --> 00:36:34.669
Did you really come from Ceará after me?

529
00:36:34.752 --> 00:36:37.630
No, from Australia.
Weren't you there yesterday? Asshole.


530
00:36:37.713 --> 00:36:41.300
So we came all the
way here for a goat?

531
00:36:43.511 --> 00:36:44.637
Yes.

532
00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.389
What do we do with them?

533
00:36:46.889 --> 00:36:47.848
I'll ask the boss.

534
00:36:49.392 --> 00:36:50.851
-We're going to die.
-What?


535
00:36:51.519 --> 00:36:53.354
Sure, what do you think will happen?

536
00:36:53.437 --> 00:36:56.524
"We caught two cops.
We'll let them go. They are nice."


537
00:36:56.607 --> 00:37:00.152
Exactly. We are cops.
They can't simply "kill" us.


538
00:37:00.236 --> 00:37:01.153
Yes.

539
00:37:01.904 --> 00:37:04.657
-Could you put it on speaker?
-No, we caught them.


540
00:37:06.075 --> 00:37:06.951
Okay.

541
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:08.995
Okay.

542
00:37:09.704 --> 00:37:10.788
Okay.

543
00:37:11.998 --> 00:37:12.832
Both?

544
00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:15.584
Okay. I know.

545
00:37:16.794 --> 00:37:17.878
Okay. Got it.

546
00:37:17.962 --> 00:37:18.796
So?

547
00:37:19.338 --> 00:37:21.465
So I have to kill you both.

548
00:37:21.549 --> 00:37:22.383
I told you so.

549
00:37:22.466 --> 00:37:24.593
Sir, can we talk?

550
00:37:24.677 --> 00:37:28.014
I've got blurred vision,
terrible hearing, and my friend


551
00:37:28.514 --> 00:37:30.975
has serious memory issues. Right, Bruce?

552
00:37:31.058 --> 00:37:32.852
Negative, no memory issue.

553
00:37:32.935 --> 00:37:36.689
We came here to find Celestina,
and a drug transaction took place.


554
00:37:36.772 --> 00:37:40.484
Then this ugly bastard with the face scar
called his boss to kill us both.


555
00:37:40.568 --> 00:37:41.736
Now we're waiting to die.

556
00:37:41.819 --> 00:37:42.862
-Right?
-That's it.


557
00:37:46.407 --> 00:37:47.533
What the hell?

558
00:37:47.616 --> 00:37:48.868
He has never died before.

559
00:38:00.421 --> 00:38:01.505
All I need is a whip.

560
00:38:10.473 --> 00:38:11.599
Ever been towel-whipped?

561
00:38:28.616 --> 00:38:29.950
Stop, I don't beat women.

562
00:38:30.034 --> 00:38:31.535
But I beat men.

563
00:38:33.704 --> 00:38:36.082
IT'S A LUXURY
IT'S SENSUAL


564
00:38:48.594 --> 00:38:49.887
You started it!

565
00:39:07.154 --> 00:39:08.906
Watch out, don't come any closer.

566
00:39:09.573 --> 00:39:11.033
I'm great with chopsticks.

567
00:39:38.769 --> 00:39:40.438
YOU ARE A MASTER

568
00:39:44.608 --> 00:39:46.735
You cowardly son of a gun.

569
00:40:07.256 --> 00:40:08.507
I need air.

570
00:40:09.133 --> 00:40:11.594
I need air.

571
00:40:11.677 --> 00:40:13.095
Come on, Trindade. He ran.

572
00:40:18.017 --> 00:40:19.143
Hurry, let's go!

573
00:40:31.614 --> 00:40:33.532
-No!
-Stop!


574
00:40:34.492 --> 00:40:36.410
Police! Get out of the car!

575
00:40:36.494 --> 00:40:39.413
-You're crazy!
-It's a police chase! Get out!


576
00:40:40.956 --> 00:40:41.957
Come here!

577
00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:45.753
Take care of this goat
as if it were your own mother.


578
00:40:49.006 --> 00:40:50.216
Can you drive?

579
00:40:50.716 --> 00:40:53.135
I can only ride a bike. You drive!

580
00:40:54.303 --> 00:40:56.096
Move over!

581
00:40:58.015 --> 00:40:59.683
Step on it!

582
00:40:59.767 --> 00:41:00.935
What are you doing?

583
00:41:01.018 --> 00:41:03.437
-I'm getting ready.
-They're getting away!


584
00:41:03.521 --> 00:41:05.231
-Seat belt.
-They're getting away!


585
00:41:05.314 --> 00:41:08.484
Fasten your seat belt.
It's dangerous downtown.


586
00:41:09.235 --> 00:41:10.694
-Hold on!
-They're getting away!


587
00:41:24.917 --> 00:41:27.086
Go!

588
00:41:27.169 --> 00:41:28.587
I'm going.

589
00:41:29.421 --> 00:41:31.924
No! Drop it, Bruce. 
You'll hurt somebody!

590
00:41:32.007 --> 00:41:34.009
Relax, I'll just shoot the tire.

591
00:41:43.435 --> 00:41:44.270
Are you okay?

592
00:41:44.895 --> 00:41:46.146
Are you insane?

593
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.023
The light is red, man!

594
00:41:49.024 --> 00:41:51.402
Stop! Police!

595
00:41:51.485 --> 00:41:53.737
Get off! I need your vehicle!
Out of the way!


596
00:41:54.738 --> 00:41:56.991
-Move it, idiot!
-Wait!


597
00:41:57.074 --> 00:41:57.908
Wait!

598
00:41:58.409 --> 00:42:00.202
Get this crap out of the way.

599
00:42:03.163 --> 00:42:03.998
Wait!

600
00:42:26.729 --> 00:42:27.896
Scumbag! Get out!

601
00:42:29.064 --> 00:42:31.108
-Go!
-Surrender yourself!


602
00:42:31.191 --> 00:42:35.070
Surrender, or I'll poke his other eye!
Surrender! I'll poke his eye!


603
00:42:35.154 --> 00:42:38.324
I swear I'll blind him!

604
00:42:38.407 --> 00:42:40.951
Surrender yourself!

605
00:42:46.206 --> 00:42:47.666
Great partner, huh?

606
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:50.085
-You could be blind now.
-I don't care!


607
00:42:50.169 --> 00:42:52.046
Bruce! I'm here.

608
00:42:52.129 --> 00:42:53.422
Where were you?

609
00:42:53.505 --> 00:42:56.342
It's a long story.
The battery died. I had to jump-start it.


610
00:42:56.425 --> 00:42:57.926
I don't want to know.

611
00:42:59.178 --> 00:43:00.346
Come on, baby.

612
00:43:01.388 --> 00:43:04.308
Stay here, okay? 
Daddy needs to work.

613
00:43:04.391 --> 00:43:05.934
Look after this goat.

614
00:43:06.018 --> 00:43:07.936
Be careful, don't let her eat the pen.

615
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:14.693
I think we're done, right?

616
00:43:15.319 --> 00:43:17.154
We can call it a day.

617
00:43:17.655 --> 00:43:18.489
Here.

618
00:43:19.448 --> 00:43:23.702
Bruce, it was an honor to work with you.
Call me next time you come to São Paulo.


619
00:43:23.786 --> 00:43:25.579
-Maybe we can go out.
-Wait!


620
00:43:25.663 --> 00:43:27.331
Our work is not over.

621
00:43:27.414 --> 00:43:31.293
Yes, it is. We
found your goat, didn't we?

622
00:43:31.377 --> 00:43:33.712
We arrested the criminal--

623
00:43:33.796 --> 00:43:37.549
But you told me Penguin is connected
to Brazil's most dangerous criminal.


624
00:43:38.467 --> 00:43:41.220
-The White Glove dude.
-Yes, but he's not our problem.


625
00:43:41.303 --> 00:43:44.515
Let's follow protocol
and pass it on to someone more competent.


626
00:43:44.598 --> 00:43:46.225
Man, don't be a fool!

627
00:43:46.308 --> 00:43:49.311
It's your chance
to prove you are a real cop.


628
00:43:50.229 --> 00:43:52.481
Who said I'm not a real cop?

629
00:43:52.564 --> 00:43:56.610
I heard a rumor, you know?
People saying this and that…


630
00:43:57.444 --> 00:43:59.071
-Should I tell you?
-Yes.


631
00:43:59.655 --> 00:44:02.282
They say, "Trindade this, 
Trindade that…"

632
00:44:02.866 --> 00:44:04.868
You know? Should I tell you?

633
00:44:04.952 --> 00:44:05.869
Tell me.

634
00:44:05.953 --> 00:44:09.456
People are saying
that your partner's death is your fault.


635
00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:10.499
There you go.

636
00:44:13.585 --> 00:44:14.420
Who said that?

637
00:44:14.503 --> 00:44:16.755
In the last hour, three different people.

638
00:44:16.839 --> 00:44:18.465
Even Ms. Rosa there.

639
00:44:21.635 --> 00:44:24.221
Do you want to live
the rest of your life as a joke?


640
00:44:25.013 --> 00:44:28.225
I could solve it all by myself,
but I need your brain.


641
00:44:28.308 --> 00:44:30.519
I can't force you, though…

642
00:44:30.602 --> 00:44:32.354
All right. What's the plan?

643
00:44:33.439 --> 00:44:34.606
Wanna grill the perp?

644
00:44:38.652 --> 00:44:39.820
-How do I look?
-Fine.


645
00:44:40.404 --> 00:44:41.405
Relax, it's easy.

646
00:44:41.488 --> 00:44:44.742
We just need to scare him,
to play with his mind.


647
00:44:44.825 --> 00:44:47.494
You'll be the good cop,
and I'll be the bad cop.


648
00:44:47.578 --> 00:44:49.079
It's not going to work.

649
00:44:51.415 --> 00:44:52.332
You are right.

650
00:44:53.083 --> 00:44:54.626
Just bad is not enough.

651
00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:58.756
I must be the evil cop.
I must be worse than bad.


652
00:44:58.839 --> 00:45:01.216
You'll be the weak cop.
I'll be the rough cop.


653
00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.469
Why am I the weak one?

654
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.722
Son of a bitch!

655
00:45:06.805 --> 00:45:10.225
Get in, say you had a fight with me,
that I'm mad, possessed by evil.


656
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:11.393
You know what? I'll go--

657
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:14.772
Trust me. It will work.

658
00:45:16.023 --> 00:45:17.357
One more, just in case.

659
00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.985
Hey! I can hear you!

660
00:45:30.954 --> 00:45:34.625
You are being accused
of the attempted murder of two policemen.


661
00:45:34.708 --> 00:45:37.586
-But, luckily, we are--
-What's up with your face?


662
00:45:39.379 --> 00:45:41.048
My partner is a little

663
00:45:42.132 --> 00:45:43.050
rough.

664
00:46:17.042 --> 00:46:18.126
Don't mind me.

665
00:46:18.210 --> 00:46:19.127
Go on.

666
00:46:22.422 --> 00:46:25.801
Well, as I was saying,
we can reduce your sentence


667
00:46:25.884 --> 00:46:28.053
if you agree to name the kingpin.

668
00:46:28.595 --> 00:46:30.639
Code name, White Glove…

669
00:46:34.393 --> 00:46:37.020
Bruce? Bruce, you can't smoke in here.

670
00:46:39.398 --> 00:46:40.232
Sorry.

671
00:46:42.276 --> 00:46:43.652
Where I come from,

672
00:46:44.444 --> 00:46:45.737
I am the law!

673
00:46:59.001 --> 00:46:59.918
Are you okay?

674
00:47:03.338 --> 00:47:04.172
Go on.

675
00:47:04.256 --> 00:47:08.135
If you tell us where the drugs are,
we can make your life easier.


676
00:47:08.218 --> 00:47:09.428
Listen up, my friend.

677
00:47:11.263 --> 00:47:12.806
I'm not talking without a lawyer.

678
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:15.976
A public defender
is being assigned to your case.


679
00:47:16.059 --> 00:47:17.978
We can wait. I'm not in a hurry.

680
00:47:18.061 --> 00:47:18.896
Hey, punk!

681
00:47:21.732 --> 00:47:23.525
My friend is being nice to you.

682
00:47:23.609 --> 00:47:25.027
You should cooperate.

683
00:47:28.822 --> 00:47:29.740
Trindade?

684
00:47:35.913 --> 00:47:37.956
My lawyer will be here in five minutes.

685
00:47:42.711 --> 00:47:46.256
Do you know who
you are talking to, punk?

686
00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.593
I am the second-degree great-grandson

687
00:47:49.676 --> 00:47:52.012
of Virgulino Ferreira da Silva,

688
00:47:52.095 --> 00:47:53.847
better known as Lampião!

689
00:47:53.931 --> 00:47:55.766
Stop it, man. You'll hurt yourself.

690
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:58.685
I must agree with the perp, you should--

691
00:47:58.769 --> 00:48:02.648
My father was the most wanted robber
of Ceará.


692
00:48:02.731 --> 00:48:05.067
The Central Bank robber.

693
00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:08.236
He dug the tunnel with this very knife.

694
00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.863
He killed his accomplices,

695
00:48:09.947 --> 00:48:11.531
peeled their skin off,

696
00:48:11.615 --> 00:48:15.035
and made a suitcase with it
to run away with all the money.


697
00:48:15.118 --> 00:48:18.121
Hold up, please.
Make him stop. It won't end well.


698
00:48:18.205 --> 00:48:21.375
Speak up, man!
Tell us who the mastermind is.


699
00:48:21.458 --> 00:48:22.918
-I don't know, man.
-Spit it out!


700
00:48:23.001 --> 00:48:25.128
I didn't wanna be a criminal.

701
00:48:25.212 --> 00:48:26.964
-Bruce, it's enough.
-Look!


702
00:48:27.047 --> 00:48:29.424
I tried to live an honest life,
but the scar…


703
00:48:29.508 --> 00:48:30.884
Who is White Glove?

704
00:48:30.968 --> 00:48:34.304
-Bruce!
-Who hires a guy with a scar nowadays?


705
00:48:34.388 --> 00:48:37.140
-Who is he?
-Say it, for God's sake!


706
00:48:37.224 --> 00:48:39.518
-He's a politician!
-He's said--


707
00:48:42.479 --> 00:48:44.231
There. I told you.

708
00:49:01.581 --> 00:49:03.875
Hi, counselor.
They left me with this psycho.


709
00:49:07.045 --> 00:49:07.879
There.

710
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:09.589
Thank you.

711
00:49:10.841 --> 00:49:11.883
Come on, Celestina.

712
00:49:13.051 --> 00:49:13.885
Come on.

713
00:49:15.679 --> 00:49:16.888
Come on, dear.

714
00:49:17.556 --> 00:49:18.640
Hey, Trindade.

715
00:49:19.182 --> 00:49:20.851
Look on the bright side.

716
00:49:21.476 --> 00:49:22.686
My plan worked out.

717
00:49:22.769 --> 00:49:24.479
Did it? Really?

718
00:49:24.563 --> 00:49:26.189
Tell me how it worked.

719
00:49:26.273 --> 00:49:30.068
You punched me in the nose,
slapped me, and stuck a knife in my hand.


720
00:49:30.152 --> 00:49:30.986
Wait!

721
00:49:31.528 --> 00:49:33.405
Your hand got in
the way of my knife.

722
00:49:33.488 --> 00:49:36.742
Also, the suspect broke down
and told us everything.


723
00:49:42.039 --> 00:49:43.832
Hey! Trindade!

724
00:49:43.915 --> 00:49:45.000
No. Okay.

725
00:49:46.835 --> 00:49:50.464
Trindade,
could we stay with you for a while,


726
00:49:50.547 --> 00:49:51.381
she and I?

727
00:49:52.966 --> 00:49:56.136
Otherwise, Celestina and I
will have to sleep on the street.


728
00:50:04.811 --> 00:50:07.189
Let's go, Celestina!
Before he changes his mind.


729
00:50:07.272 --> 00:50:08.857
This way.

730
00:50:14.446 --> 00:50:15.572
I've just adopted it.

731
00:50:16.865 --> 00:50:18.700
For company.

732
00:50:22.412 --> 00:50:23.497
She's docile.

733
00:50:24.664 --> 00:50:26.124
Make yourself at home.

734
00:50:31.505 --> 00:50:35.801
Do you think it will take long for her
to expel the drugs she ate?


735
00:50:35.884 --> 00:50:38.970
I'm worried.
It should have happened already.


736
00:50:40.931 --> 00:50:42.599
Relax­. It will come out soon.

737
00:50:43.767 --> 00:50:44.601
Well…

738
00:50:45.102 --> 00:50:48.730
Shall we list what we know
about the White Glove? He is a politician…


739
00:50:49.523 --> 00:50:52.776
-He must be from Ceará, like the drugs.
-Maybe, what else?


740
00:50:53.276 --> 00:50:54.111
Well…

741
00:50:57.572 --> 00:51:00.158
well, I thought we had more clues.

742
00:51:00.242 --> 00:51:02.202
We will never get this guy.

743
00:51:02.911 --> 00:51:04.371
Ouch.

744
00:51:06.498 --> 00:51:08.583
I'm sorry for punching you.

745
00:51:09.501 --> 00:51:11.461
Sometimes I can't control my strength.

746
00:51:11.545 --> 00:51:13.797
Where did you learn to fight like that?

747
00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.424
Man, that's years and years of study.

748
00:51:16.508 --> 00:51:17.843
Before I became a cop,

749
00:51:17.926 --> 00:51:20.387
I already had black belts
in tae kwon do, kung fu,


750
00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:22.597
karate, aikido, 
Krav Maga, judo,

751
00:51:22.681 --> 00:51:25.433
and now I have
a green belt in CrossFit,

752
00:51:25.517 --> 00:51:27.144
and I started Zumba classes.

753
00:51:27.227 --> 00:51:29.521
-Stand up. I will teach you.
-No.


754
00:51:29.604 --> 00:51:32.983
I won't punch you. I'll teach you.
Stand up, don't be lazy-- Stand up!


755
00:51:34.818 --> 00:51:35.777
Take it easy, okay?

756
00:51:35.861 --> 00:51:39.072
The punch. The strength
doesn't come from your hand.


757
00:51:40.031 --> 00:51:41.867
Otherwise, it'll break your fingers.

758
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:44.077
-It comes from the hips.
-Hey!


759
00:51:44.161 --> 00:51:44.995
Relax.

760
00:51:45.704 --> 00:51:46.705
Make a fist.

761
00:51:48.874 --> 00:51:50.584
Punch. Hips.

762
00:51:51.168 --> 00:51:53.086
Go back. That's it. Hips.

763
00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:55.338
-Punch. That's it.
-Like this?


764
00:51:55.422 --> 00:51:57.591
Yes, that's it.

765
00:51:58.300 --> 00:51:59.843
I think I got it.

766
00:51:59.926 --> 00:52:01.595
I got it. Check it out.

767
00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:06.641
I know who the White Glove is.

768
00:52:08.393 --> 00:52:10.020
Federal Deputy Zeca Brito.

769
00:52:11.021 --> 00:52:12.522
The clown turned deputy.

770
00:52:12.606 --> 00:52:13.773
That's him.

771
00:52:13.857 --> 00:52:16.109
This guy is nothing but trouble.

772
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:17.819
Our history

773
00:52:18.778 --> 00:52:20.113
goes back a long way.

774
00:52:21.156 --> 00:52:22.532
Gather round, come closer.

775
00:52:22.616 --> 00:52:24.534
Come over here. 
Do you like magic?

776
00:52:24.618 --> 00:52:26.745
-Yes.
-Give me your rapadura.


777
00:52:26.828 --> 00:52:28.121
Here it is.

778
00:52:28.205 --> 00:52:30.040
I will make it disappear.

779
00:52:30.123 --> 00:52:33.168
Pay attention because this trick is wild.

780
00:52:35.045 --> 00:52:37.923
It's gone. What is that?

781
00:52:39.216 --> 00:52:40.383
That's all. Bye, kids.

782
00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.846
Let's go. Drive.

783
00:53:00.612 --> 00:53:03.531
It was because of this man
that I became a police officer.


784
00:53:03.615 --> 00:53:04.991
I swore to myself,

785
00:53:05.075 --> 00:53:09.246
"No one will ever steal a child's rapadura
again and get away with it."


786
00:53:09.329 --> 00:53:12.707
Yes, it's dramatic,
but it doesn't prove anything.


787
00:53:14.417 --> 00:53:17.379
It proves he's a devious character.
He steals candy from kids.


788
00:53:17.462 --> 00:53:18.922
It's not enough.

789
00:53:19.005 --> 00:53:22.550
-He wore white gloves as a clown.
-So do all clowns.


790
00:53:22.634 --> 00:53:24.803
But only he has
the gloves and the rapadura.


791
00:53:24.886 --> 00:53:26.554
Sleazy crook!

792
00:53:27.055 --> 00:53:29.432
He built his career promoting rapadura.

793
00:53:29.516 --> 00:53:30.684
Hold on.

794
00:53:30.767 --> 00:53:32.435
What do you mean?

795
00:53:32.936 --> 00:53:35.063
He was the deputy that promoted

796
00:53:35.146 --> 00:53:37.190
the rapadura from Ceará in Brazil.

797
00:53:37.274 --> 00:53:39.693
-Are you serious?
-Look at his flyer.


798
00:53:40.235 --> 00:53:42.070
His campaign is all about rapadura.

799
00:53:42.612 --> 00:53:44.281
"Rapadura for the people."

800
00:53:49.744 --> 00:53:51.746
Push! Harder!

801
00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:54.165
Push, baby, push.

802
00:53:57.836 --> 00:53:59.337
"During his first term,

803
00:53:59.421 --> 00:54:02.841
the sales of rapadura from Ceará spiked."

804
00:54:02.924 --> 00:54:04.050
I told you.

805
00:54:04.134 --> 00:54:07.012
This is the company
that profited the most from it.


806
00:54:07.095 --> 00:54:08.972
"Gimme Moar Rapadura."

807
00:54:09.055 --> 00:54:14.019
A suitable name
for a highly addictive substance.


808
00:54:14.728 --> 00:54:16.855
"Give me more."

809
00:54:19.441 --> 00:54:21.401
Guess who is in
São Paulo for an event.

810
00:54:21.943 --> 00:54:24.362
Zeca Brito. What a coincidence.

811
00:54:26.698 --> 00:54:29.659
There's no such thing as coincidence, pal.

812
00:54:40.879 --> 00:54:42.589
Priscila, I need to talk to you--

813
00:54:42.672 --> 00:54:43.840
I'm busy.

814
00:54:43.923 --> 00:54:45.383
I told you she's difficult.

815
00:54:45.467 --> 00:54:46.426
Captain Priscila,

816
00:54:46.509 --> 00:54:48.678
Officer Bruceuílis Nonato at your service.

817
00:54:50.221 --> 00:54:53.350
I am also an athlete.
I've won four Rapadura Man,


818
00:54:53.433 --> 00:54:55.518
which is the triathlon in my hometown.

819
00:54:57.228 --> 00:55:00.857
-My partner and I have a case for you.
-Are you letting this one die too?


820
00:55:00.940 --> 00:55:04.652
-Bruce is quite alive for now, okay?
-If it were up to you…


821
00:55:04.736 --> 00:55:06.905
I'm not interested. Go away!

822
00:55:06.988 --> 00:55:08.907
It's about the White Glove.

823
00:55:09.741 --> 00:55:12.035
You have five minutes.

824
00:55:12.118 --> 00:55:14.079
And that's why we believe

825
00:55:14.162 --> 00:55:17.415
that Zeca Brito must be the White Glove.

826
00:55:18.208 --> 00:55:21.127
-Did you come up with this together?
-Affirmative.


827
00:55:21.211 --> 00:55:24.798
I even beat the criminals at the bar
and conducted the interrogation.


828
00:55:24.881 --> 00:55:25.924
Do we have a case?

829
00:55:26.007 --> 00:55:28.510
-You don't have a case.
-Why not?


830
00:55:28.593 --> 00:55:30.303
All you have is conjecture.

831
00:55:30.387 --> 00:55:33.223
You can't use any of this information
as evidence.


832
00:55:33.306 --> 00:55:36.393
-But the drugs the goat sh--
-Expelled, after great effort.


833
00:55:36.476 --> 00:55:38.645
You can't prove their origin.

834
00:55:38.728 --> 00:55:42.065
How come? We were there
when the poor thing forced it out.


835
00:55:42.148 --> 00:55:43.483
With Thunderbolt's support--

836
00:55:45.068 --> 00:55:48.696
I won't risk the whole operation
based on the conspiracy theory


837
00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:49.697
of a weak officer.

838
00:55:49.781 --> 00:55:51.157
Captain Priscila…

839
00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:52.742
-Can I call you Pri?
-No!


840
00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:55.537
Such a beautiful name.

841
00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:59.499
I think a good cop must have instinct.
Not everything is solved on a spreadsheet.


842
00:55:59.582 --> 00:56:02.085
-I disagree.
-Good instincts are key.


843
00:56:02.168 --> 00:56:05.713
And I have a gut feeling
that we must track Zeca Brito.


844
00:56:05.797 --> 00:56:07.090
What's your instinct tell you?

845
00:56:07.173 --> 00:56:10.385
I've got a feeling that both of you

846
00:56:10.468 --> 00:56:12.554
should stay away from Deputy Zeca Brito!

847
00:56:15.974 --> 00:56:19.060
-Are you okay?
-Holy shit!


848
00:56:19.978 --> 00:56:21.312
She's a tough woman.

849
00:56:22.021 --> 00:56:24.107
Did you notice the connection between us?

850
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.859
I want to prove she's wrong.

851
00:56:25.942 --> 00:56:27.193
Then why don't you?

852
00:56:27.277 --> 00:56:29.446
You and me against an entire cartel?

853
00:56:29.529 --> 00:56:32.073
-What's the problem?
-We'll die, Bruce.


854
00:56:32.157 --> 00:56:34.200
Would you rather live as a coward
or die a hero?


855
00:56:34.284 --> 00:56:36.870
Can I live as a hero?

856
00:56:37.579 --> 00:56:38.413
No, you can't.

857
00:56:39.038 --> 00:56:41.916
We will break into his house,
kidnap Zeca Brito,


858
00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.669
and I'll use my interrogation techniques.

859
00:56:44.752 --> 00:56:45.587
No.

860
00:56:46.087 --> 00:56:48.923
We will do things my way this time.

861
00:57:00.101 --> 00:57:02.187
Bruce?

862
00:57:10.403 --> 00:57:14.365
He doesn't look like the head
of a criminal organization.


863
00:57:14.449 --> 00:57:16.201
Don't be fooled.

864
00:57:17.202 --> 00:57:18.620
This man is no good.

865
00:57:18.703 --> 00:57:20.622
Damn rapadura thief.

866
00:57:20.705 --> 00:57:21.873
1:41 p.m.

867
00:57:22.415 --> 00:57:23.875
The suspect's lunch is over.

868
00:57:26.586 --> 00:57:28.338
Follow him. Hurry, driver.

869
00:57:28.838 --> 00:57:31.549
Do you have a preferred route,
or can I follow the app?


870
00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:33.092
Preferred route.

871
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.391
-Is the temperature okay?
-It's great, Josimara.


872
00:57:40.475 --> 00:57:42.477
-Any radio station?
-Whatever.


873
00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:43.937
Just don't lose that guy.

874
00:57:48.983 --> 00:57:51.027
Actually, turn it off, Josimara.

875
00:57:52.237 --> 00:57:53.071
Fine.

876
00:57:54.989 --> 00:57:56.574
-Candy, water?
-No--


877
00:57:56.658 --> 00:57:58.493
I'd like some water. Is it free?

878
00:57:58.576 --> 00:58:00.203
Yes, help yourself.

879
00:58:00.912 --> 00:58:04.958
I was wondering,
how long is this mission going to take?


880
00:58:05.041 --> 00:58:08.169
We'll watch him
until we see something useful.


881
00:58:08.253 --> 00:58:09.254
Right, Trindade?

882
00:58:09.337 --> 00:58:10.505
I better tell Robson.

883
00:58:11.339 --> 00:58:13.132
-No! It's confidential.
-Robson?


884
00:58:13.216 --> 00:58:16.094
Where are you? I'm on the toilet.
Can you go buy toilet paper?


885
00:58:16.177 --> 00:58:18.304
I'm working, lazy ass!

886
00:58:18.805 --> 00:58:21.391
-It's gonna take a while.
-You're at the bar, aren't you?


887
00:58:21.474 --> 00:58:23.643
I'm working, didn't you hear me?

888
00:58:23.726 --> 00:58:25.478
-I'm with two cops.
-Arrested again?


889
00:58:25.562 --> 00:58:28.898
I told you to stop messing with weed,
Josimara!


890
00:58:28.982 --> 00:58:32.360
-If you go to jail again…
-You're breaking up. We'll talk later.


891
00:58:32.443 --> 00:58:36.114
You and your damn weed.
Your mother warned me not to marry you--


892
00:58:36.197 --> 00:58:39.409
Hey, look.
The suspect is stopping at a hotel.


893
00:58:40.159 --> 00:58:41.119
Pull over!

894
00:58:46.332 --> 00:58:48.918
So this is it, right?

895
00:58:49.544 --> 00:58:51.879
The rapadura thief's hideout.

896
00:58:51.963 --> 00:58:54.924
This fancy hotel
is not exactly a hideout, Bruce.


897
00:58:55.008 --> 00:58:57.468
Wait, your suspect is Deputy Zeca Brito?

898
00:58:58.094 --> 00:58:58.928
Damn!

899
00:59:00.221 --> 00:59:01.055
My bad.

900
00:59:03.433 --> 00:59:06.603
2:12 p.m. The suspect
almost realizes he's being followed.


901
00:59:06.686 --> 00:59:09.230
That's it for today.
We can come back tomorrow.


902
00:59:09.314 --> 00:59:11.065
I'll update the address, Josimara.

903
00:59:11.149 --> 00:59:13.610
No way.
What if he goes out this afternoon?


904
00:59:13.693 --> 00:59:16.279
-We must have eyes on him.
-I'm free for the day.


905
00:59:16.362 --> 00:59:19.157
-This ride will cost a fortune.
-It was your idea.


906
00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.951
Is anybody else hungry?
I've only had candy today.


907
00:59:23.244 --> 00:59:24.495
Yeah, I'm starving.

908
00:59:25.872 --> 00:59:27.248
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.


909
00:59:28.708 --> 00:59:29.667
Where's my soda?

910
00:59:31.252 --> 00:59:33.171
So you killed your partner?

911
00:59:33.254 --> 00:59:34.756
I didn't kill him.

912
00:59:34.839 --> 00:59:37.800
I dodged the bullets and,
because of that, he was killed.


913
00:59:38.343 --> 00:59:41.179
My God! Why doesn't anybody get it?

914
00:59:41.721 --> 00:59:43.056
Is there any ricotta left?

915
00:59:43.556 --> 00:59:45.975
A friend got into a fight
with some taxi drivers.


916
00:59:46.059 --> 00:59:49.020
I tried to defend him
and got hit by three taxis,


917
00:59:49.103 --> 00:59:50.271
one after the other.

918
00:59:50.355 --> 00:59:52.982
See? Even Josimara defends her partner.

919
00:59:53.066 --> 00:59:55.068
Say whatever you want,

920
00:59:55.151 --> 00:59:57.111
but I didn't become
a cop to get shot.

921
00:59:57.195 --> 00:59:59.364
Then what for? Desk duty?

922
00:59:59.447 --> 01:00:01.532
Desk duty is as important as any role.

923
01:00:01.616 --> 01:00:02.992
God forbid.

924
01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.954
My dad
used to put on Stallone's Cobra for me.


925
01:00:07.038 --> 01:00:08.164
I'd watch and think,

926
01:00:08.748 --> 01:00:11.000
"When I grow up,
I'll be just like that guy."


927
01:00:11.084 --> 01:00:13.419
My grandma tried
to make me watch those movies,


928
01:00:14.253 --> 01:00:16.422
but I preferred Flashdance,

929
01:00:17.173 --> 01:00:19.092
Saturday Night Fever…

930
01:00:19.175 --> 01:00:21.678
I like Shrek 2. Have you seen it?

931
01:00:21.761 --> 01:00:23.179
It's better than the first.

932
01:00:23.262 --> 01:00:26.808
The third is kind of lame,
but the second is great.


933
01:00:26.891 --> 01:00:30.144
-The donkey is like, "Are we there yet?"
-All right.


934
01:00:30.228 --> 01:00:32.313
Time for my siesta.

935
01:00:32.397 --> 01:00:35.108
Watch out
for any suspicious activity, okay?


936
01:00:35.191 --> 01:00:36.609
No, Bruce, you better--

937
01:00:47.578 --> 01:00:49.997
Hey. He is leaving.

938
01:00:50.665 --> 01:00:51.624
He is leaving!

939
01:00:53.376 --> 01:00:56.045
7:23 p.m.

940
01:00:56.671 --> 01:00:57.588
The eagle

941
01:00:58.506 --> 01:01:01.008
leaves the nest.

942
01:01:02.427 --> 01:01:05.179
Where is he going
with that suspicious briefcase?


943
01:01:05.263 --> 01:01:07.765
Don't assume anything.
It's a regular briefcase.


944
01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:10.810
Have you ever seen an honest man
with a briefcase like that?


945
01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:15.898
Only politicians, lawyers,
and criminals use black briefcases.


946
01:01:16.399 --> 01:01:17.400
Very true.

947
01:01:17.483 --> 01:01:20.319
People with briefcases like that
never give five stars.


948
01:01:20.403 --> 01:01:21.738
Follow the suspect, Josimara.

949
01:01:35.293 --> 01:01:38.379
Look, another man with a black briefcase,
and he's bald.


950
01:01:38.463 --> 01:01:41.299
A bald man with a black briefcase…
Enough said.


951
01:01:41.799 --> 01:01:42.675
What do you mean?

952
01:01:42.759 --> 01:01:45.762
A highly dangerous person. A criminal.

953
01:01:45.845 --> 01:01:49.515
Look, you can see the bald man's tattoo
above his shirt's collar.


954
01:01:49.599 --> 01:01:52.977
Every criminal has a neck tattoo.
You know that, right?


955
01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.521
Maybe you are-
- Bruce?

956
01:01:56.481 --> 01:01:58.399
-Come back, Bruce.
-May I end the ride?


957
01:01:59.192 --> 01:02:00.193
Yes, please.

958
01:02:00.276 --> 01:02:02.487
-Thank you, Josimara.
-You're welcome.


959
01:02:03.863 --> 01:02:05.948
Hey, don't forget my five stars!

960
01:02:17.043 --> 01:02:19.754
Don't do anything
until the negotiation is over, okay?


961
01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:21.547
I know how it works.

962
01:02:23.216 --> 01:02:24.801
-Good evening.
-Good evening.


963
01:02:24.884 --> 01:02:26.177
Table for two, please.

964
01:02:26.886 --> 01:02:31.265
Unfortunately, the restaurant is closed
for a charity event.


965
01:02:31.849 --> 01:02:33.601
I bet it's money laundering.

966
01:02:34.393 --> 01:02:35.645
Sir, I can hear you.

967
01:02:37.146 --> 01:02:39.315
We came here to attend this event.

968
01:02:40.107 --> 01:02:40.942
Of course.

969
01:02:41.734 --> 01:02:43.986
What's your name, please?

970
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:45.780
I'll check the list.

971
01:02:46.656 --> 01:02:48.282
-My name?
-Yes.


972
01:02:49.492 --> 01:02:50.910
My name…

973
01:02:51.994 --> 01:02:53.454
-José Silva.
-What?


974
01:02:53.538 --> 01:02:54.622
José Silva.

975
01:02:54.705 --> 01:02:56.415
Yes, José Silva. Check it out.

976
01:02:58.209 --> 01:02:59.627
The most common name.

977
01:03:03.214 --> 01:03:04.048
Here it is.

978
01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:07.009
-José Silva.
-I told you.


979
01:03:07.093 --> 01:03:08.719
Table for two, right?

980
01:03:08.803 --> 01:03:10.513
For you and your husband.

981
01:03:10.596 --> 01:03:11.931
-Husband?
-Husband?


982
01:03:13.808 --> 01:03:14.976
Aren't you married?

983
01:03:15.059 --> 01:03:17.854
In the confirmation email, you asked for,

984
01:03:17.937 --> 01:03:21.023
"A table to enjoy the view
with my husband,


985
01:03:21.107 --> 01:03:22.483
the great love of my life."

986
01:03:22.567 --> 01:03:25.319
Too much information, actually.
We only asked for the name.


987
01:03:29.115 --> 01:03:29.991
We are--

988
01:03:31.117 --> 01:03:34.537
The two of us have been married for,
what, ten years?


989
01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.621
-Ten years.
-Ten.


990
01:03:38.791 --> 01:03:40.209
Oh, this man…

991
01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.631
-This is love!
-That's so beautiful!


992
01:03:45.715 --> 01:03:47.341
True love!

993
01:03:47.425 --> 01:03:48.551
So beautiful.

994
01:03:48.634 --> 01:03:51.721
Can I ask a favor?
I don't want to intrude,


995
01:03:51.804 --> 01:03:55.266
but do you mind if I take a picture of you
to post on Instagram?


996
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:56.309
-Sure.
-Ready?


997
01:03:56.392 --> 01:03:58.060
Ready. Let's do it!

998
01:03:58.144 --> 01:03:59.896
No. A little peck.

999
01:03:59.979 --> 01:04:02.315
-It's cuter.
-That's too much, ma'am.


1000
01:04:02.398 --> 01:04:06.485
-We are very discreet.
-Don't be silly, babe. Let's do it.


1001
01:04:06.569 --> 01:04:08.195
-Okay.
-Just tell me when.


1002
01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:10.197
-Sure. On two, okay?
-On two.


1003
01:04:10.281 --> 01:04:12.783
-Tell us.
-One, two, and…


1004
01:04:12.867 --> 01:04:13.701
Kiss!

1005
01:04:13.784 --> 01:04:14.744
Done.

1006
01:04:14.827 --> 01:04:16.704
It was the selfie cam, sorry.

1007
01:04:16.787 --> 01:04:18.581
Again. Ready? On two.

1008
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:22.543
One, two, and…

1009
01:04:23.044 --> 01:04:24.712
Hold it! Wait!

1010
01:04:25.755 --> 01:04:27.924
I'll hide your double chin. Wait.

1011
01:04:28.007 --> 01:04:29.550
Okay, done.

1012
01:04:30.718 --> 01:04:32.094
Enjoy the evening.

1013
01:04:33.095 --> 01:04:33.930
Thank you.

1014
01:04:51.948 --> 01:04:53.115
The perfect spot.

1015
01:04:53.199 --> 01:04:55.076
A peripheral view of the place.

1016
01:04:55.159 --> 01:04:57.078
We're too far away. 
I can't hear anything.

1017
01:04:57.161 --> 01:04:58.913
I can read lips.

1018
01:04:58.996 --> 01:05:00.289
-I've got it.
-Really?


1019
01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:02.041
Of course. Watch this.

1020
01:05:03.376 --> 01:05:04.919
"Did you bring the drugs?"

1021
01:05:05.002 --> 01:05:06.963
"Of course
I brought the drugs you asked for."


1022
01:05:07.046 --> 01:05:08.881
"I asked for a lot of drugs

1023
01:05:08.965 --> 01:05:12.510
because I'm a criminal,
and criminals like lots of drugs."


1024
01:05:12.593 --> 01:05:14.887
I don't think they are saying that.

1025
01:05:14.971 --> 01:05:17.932
"Now give me the drugs,
and I'll give you the money."


1026
01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:18.849
Bruce?

1027
01:05:19.475 --> 01:05:21.018
Bruce, it's happening.

1028
01:05:21.811 --> 01:05:23.938
-Let's approach them.
-No, hold on.


1029
01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:25.648
-It's our only chance.
-Wait.


1030
01:05:25.731 --> 01:05:27.984
Let's approach them peacefully, okay?

1031
01:05:28.567 --> 01:05:29.402
Breathe.

1032
01:05:30.152 --> 01:05:31.195
Nobody move!

1033
01:05:31.278 --> 01:05:33.864
It's over, Zeca Brito, you rapadura thief!

1034
01:05:33.948 --> 01:05:34.991
What is going on?

1035
01:05:35.074 --> 01:05:36.909
I know this is a drug deal!

1036
01:05:36.993 --> 01:05:39.912
Calm down!
Ladies and gentlemen, attention!


1037
01:05:39.996 --> 01:05:41.831
This is a police operation!

1038
01:05:41.914 --> 01:05:43.958
I'd like to ask for your cooperation.

1039
01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:47.420
Especially yours,
bald man with a black briefcase.


1040
01:05:47.503 --> 01:05:49.839
-Bruce.
-Wait-- My briefcase. Deputy?


1041
01:05:49.922 --> 01:05:52.049
Sir, I think it's a mistake.

1042
01:05:52.133 --> 01:05:53.634
There's no mistake, you crook!

1043
01:05:53.718 --> 01:05:56.554
-I knew my feeling was right!
-Yes!


1044
01:05:57.388 --> 01:05:58.848
I can explain--

1045
01:06:00.016 --> 01:06:01.308
Sorry, I didn't mean to do it.

1046
01:06:01.392 --> 01:06:03.686
-Great punch, buddy.
-Really?


1047
01:06:03.769 --> 01:06:05.354
Come on, you crook!

1048
01:06:05.438 --> 01:06:09.108
This money is a donation
to this man's hospital.


1049
01:06:09.191 --> 01:06:11.402
The medicine is
for acute child fibromyalgia!


1050
01:06:11.485 --> 01:06:13.988
Let's see what the judge
has to say about it.


1051
01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:17.658
-Thank you, Uncle Zeca Brito!
-Thank you, Uncle Zeca Brito!


1052
01:06:17.742 --> 01:06:20.703
-Bruce, I don't think--
-Don't let it fool you!


1053
01:06:20.786 --> 01:06:23.748
These are midgets disguised
to deceive the electorate!


1054
01:06:24.331 --> 01:06:25.791
You are all under arrest!

1055
01:06:28.127 --> 01:06:29.837
Such a cute couple, right?

1056
01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.174
I had no idea, guys. No, really…

1057
01:06:33.966 --> 01:06:36.886
-It's surprising, right?
-It happens a lot to me.


1058
01:06:36.969 --> 01:06:39.180
A bald man with a black briefcase…

1059
01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:44.101
People think I'm a criminal.
And this medication patch on my neck…


1060
01:06:44.185 --> 01:06:47.229
People think it's a tattoo, but it's not.
It's for my stiff neck.


1061
01:06:47.313 --> 01:06:49.231
Rapadura is sweet, but it's also hard.

1062
01:06:49.315 --> 01:06:52.526
I hope those idiots get punished
for this abuse of power.


1063
01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:55.446
Brazil above everything,
and me above everyone. Bye.


1064
01:07:09.043 --> 01:07:12.880
I specifically told you not to follow him,
and what did you do?


1065
01:07:12.963 --> 01:07:14.256
We followed him.

1066
01:07:15.674 --> 01:07:17.176
It was a rhetorical question.

1067
01:07:19.261 --> 01:07:25.184
Priscila, I know you are mad at us,
but we just followed our instincts--


1068
01:07:25.267 --> 01:07:28.771
A shitty instinct.
You jeopardized the whole operation.


1069
01:07:28.854 --> 01:07:33.818
I told you not to mess with Zeca Brito
because we were already monitoring him.


1070
01:07:33.901 --> 01:07:35.277
It proves we were right.

1071
01:07:35.361 --> 01:07:37.196
Except he didn't know that.

1072
01:07:37.279 --> 01:07:40.324
If he really is the White Glove,
now he knows we're onto him.


1073
01:07:40.407 --> 01:07:42.118
Priscila, I just wanna clarify

1074
01:07:42.201 --> 01:07:44.453
it was Trindade who punched the deputy.

1075
01:07:45.246 --> 01:07:46.205
And, in my defense,

1076
01:07:46.288 --> 01:07:49.125
those kids were very hairy for their age.

1077
01:07:49.208 --> 01:07:50.876
One even had a tiny mustache.

1078
01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.837
You'd easily mistake him
for a short person.


1079
01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:55.089
I hope this won't harm our relationship.

1080
01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:59.468
You both disobeyed my orders,
put the operation at stake.


1081
01:07:59.552 --> 01:08:00.469
By the way,

1082
01:08:00.553 --> 01:08:03.639
you spent 3,000 reais on an Uber
using the corporate card.


1083
01:08:03.722 --> 01:08:06.433
-Was it Uber Black?
-I told you.


1084
01:08:06.517 --> 01:08:09.186
Just to make it clear,
I don't care for Uber.


1085
01:08:09.270 --> 01:08:10.980
I prefer public transportation.

1086
01:08:11.063 --> 01:08:14.900
Give me one more reason I shouldn't unload
the next round in your face.


1087
01:08:15.401 --> 01:08:18.404
-It's a crime?
-In my case, a crime of passion, right?


1088
01:08:19.572 --> 01:08:21.490
As of now, you're both suspended.

1089
01:08:24.034 --> 01:08:26.162
Wait! You can't suspend me.

1090
01:08:26.245 --> 01:08:27.705
You'll go back to Ceará.

1091
01:08:27.788 --> 01:08:31.041
As for you, Trindade, get real, man.
You are pathetic.


1092
01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:34.170
You are the worst cop
this district has ever had,


1093
01:08:34.253 --> 01:08:36.505
and Amílcar accidentally killed
two hostages.


1094
01:08:36.589 --> 01:08:38.257
An elderly woman and a pregnant woman.

1095
01:08:40.926 --> 01:08:43.220
-Hey, Amílcar.
-Do the force a favor.


1096
01:08:43.304 --> 01:08:46.265
Get yourself another career.
You're unworthy of your badge.


1097
01:09:05.034 --> 01:09:06.660
I got your digits from Amílcar.

1098
01:09:07.369 --> 01:09:08.537
Save my number.

1099
01:09:09.455 --> 01:09:12.791
Text me, and we can grab a drink.

1100
01:09:21.842 --> 01:09:23.135
I was thinking,

1101
01:09:23.219 --> 01:09:26.138
what if we use Celestina
to sniff out the rapadura?


1102
01:09:26.222 --> 01:09:28.224
-She's got a good nose.
-Forget it.


1103
01:09:30.267 --> 01:09:32.102
Are you going to let them walk free?

1104
01:09:33.896 --> 01:09:36.190
We lost, Bruce. Move on.

1105
01:09:37.483 --> 01:09:41.779
Hey, bro, where is that tough cop
who caught Zeca Brito red-handed?


1106
01:09:41.862 --> 01:09:45.950
It didn't work,
and it almost cost us our jobs.


1107
01:09:46.533 --> 01:09:48.160
It's over, man! 
That's enough.

1108
01:09:48.702 --> 01:09:50.120
I won't give up that easily.

1109
01:09:50.204 --> 01:09:52.957
Forget this case once and for all, Bruce.

1110
01:09:53.624 --> 01:09:57.503
I also thought we could do it alone,
but I was wrong, okay?


1111
01:09:57.586 --> 01:09:59.213
We are not real cops.

1112
01:09:59.296 --> 01:10:02.758
Calm down, man.
That's not how you talk to your partner.


1113
01:10:02.841 --> 01:10:04.134
You are not my partner!

1114
01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.178
You're just a nutjob

1115
01:10:06.262 --> 01:10:08.555
who came all the way from Ceará

1116
01:10:08.639 --> 01:10:09.974
searching for a goat

1117
01:10:10.057 --> 01:10:11.892
without anyone's permission.

1118
01:10:11.976 --> 01:10:15.980
And you made me believe
that goat was a kidnapped child!


1119
01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:19.191
You should've never come here.

1120
01:10:19.275 --> 01:10:21.568
Bruce, get that into your head!

1121
01:10:24.405 --> 01:10:27.157
Since you arrived,
my life has only gotten worse, Bruce.


1122
01:10:27.241 --> 01:10:29.493
It's time for you
to go back to your hometown.


1123
01:10:33.247 --> 01:10:34.081
Got it.

1124
01:10:50.889 --> 01:10:53.517
Let's go, Celestina.
It's a long way to Guará.


1125
01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.686
Yes, Guaramobim!

1126
01:11:54.703 --> 01:11:56.205
Forgot something, Bruce?

1127
01:12:01.377 --> 01:12:02.336
Let's go, Ce.

1128
01:12:10.427 --> 01:12:13.347
-Is this a bad time?
-Well, you showed up unannounced.


1129
01:12:18.602 --> 01:12:19.436
Little goat.

1130
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:23.982
-Don't touch Celestina, you piece of shit!
-Don't provoke the crook!


1131
01:12:25.984 --> 01:12:27.569
Let me tell you a story, boy.

1132
01:12:28.195 --> 01:12:31.824
When I was a kid,
my dad would never let me eat rapadura.


1133
01:12:31.907 --> 01:12:34.159
So that's why you steal candy from kids.

1134
01:12:34.243 --> 01:12:35.244
Don't interrupt me.

1135
01:12:35.744 --> 01:12:36.954
Because of that,

1136
01:12:37.538 --> 01:12:41.041
I worked hard so that no child
would go through what I went through.


1137
01:12:41.125 --> 01:12:42.793
Rapadura is for everyone.

1138
01:12:42.876 --> 01:12:44.253
Rapadura full of drugs?

1139
01:12:44.336 --> 01:12:47.631
The drugs came later as a side hustle.

1140
01:12:47.714 --> 01:12:49.800
Do politicians need a side hustle?

1141
01:12:49.883 --> 01:12:52.678
Boy, I am an honest politician.

1142
01:12:57.599 --> 01:12:58.642
Now, my friends,

1143
01:12:58.725 --> 01:13:00.352
I am going to kill you,

1144
01:13:00.978 --> 01:13:04.064
then I will expand the distribution
of Gimme Moar,


1145
01:13:04.148 --> 01:13:06.692
rapadura with additives, overseas.

1146
01:13:06.775 --> 01:13:08.444
Aren't you supposed to be honest?

1147
01:13:08.527 --> 01:13:10.028
Zeca Brito is honest,

1148
01:13:10.571 --> 01:13:11.905
but the White Glove isn't.

1149
01:13:12.406 --> 01:13:13.449
No.

1150
01:13:16.535 --> 01:13:18.328
-What did he say?
-I don't know.


1151
01:13:19.997 --> 01:13:21.290
"Bomb" in Chinese.

1152
01:13:21.874 --> 01:13:23.459
While you are being blown up,

1153
01:13:23.542 --> 01:13:26.128
I'll distribute the drugs I brought

1154
01:13:26.211 --> 01:13:27.671
while I still can.

1155
01:13:28.213 --> 01:13:31.258
I already have meetings with
all the organized crime groups in Brazil.


1156
01:13:31.341 --> 01:13:34.678
-And then what?
-Then I'll take some time off, a--


1157
01:13:34.761 --> 01:13:36.680
What is the word?

1158
01:13:36.763 --> 01:13:38.932
-A sabbatical.
-Yes, a sabbatical year.


1159
01:13:39.016 --> 01:13:42.144
To focus more on politics,
get my daughters married,


1160
01:13:42.769 --> 01:13:44.938
perhaps visit Guará again…

1161
01:13:45.022 --> 01:13:46.023
Which Guará?

1162
01:13:49.693 --> 01:13:51.278
You won't get away that easy!

1163
01:13:51.361 --> 01:13:53.989
Killing is a capital offense,
you son of a gun.


1164
01:13:54.072 --> 01:13:58.660
My friend, I am a federal deputy.
I have parliamentary immunity.


1165
01:13:58.744 --> 01:14:01.872
I could kill the Pope,
and nobody would come after me.


1166
01:14:02.664 --> 01:14:03.499
Come on.

1167
01:14:07.377 --> 01:14:08.670
Can you move?

1168
01:14:08.754 --> 01:14:10.839
It's too tight.
I think it's a sailor's knot.


1169
01:14:11.632 --> 01:14:12.591
We're going to die.

1170
01:14:13.967 --> 01:14:15.719
It was an honor to be your partner.

1171
01:14:16.428 --> 01:14:19.181
-I wish we could have one more mission.
-Me too.


1172
01:14:19.681 --> 01:14:22.434
Forget everything I said.
I was just angry.


1173
01:14:22.518 --> 01:14:26.230
You are a great cop,
Officer Bruceuílis Nonato.


1174
01:14:26.313 --> 01:14:29.191
I became a cop so I could have
a partner like you someday.


1175
01:14:31.485 --> 01:14:33.320
Go away, Celestina!

1176
01:14:33.403 --> 01:14:36.240
Run, darling, run! 
Run away while you can!

1177
01:14:37.324 --> 01:14:38.951
Hold on, Trindade.

1178
01:14:39.034 --> 01:14:41.078
Celestina might help us defuse the bomb.

1179
01:14:41.161 --> 01:14:44.456
-Sure.
-She just has to cut the right wire.


1180
01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:47.376
How would she do that, Bruce? Tell me!

1181
01:14:47.918 --> 01:14:50.254
Relax,
I have a mental connection with her.


1182
01:14:57.344 --> 01:14:59.638
Celestina, honey, can you hear me?

1183
01:15:00.556 --> 01:15:02.266
Bruce!

1184
01:15:02.808 --> 01:15:04.601
What's going on?

1185
01:15:04.685 --> 01:15:05.978
Are you serious?

1186
01:15:07.145 --> 01:15:08.855
Celestina, pay attention.

1187
01:15:09.648 --> 01:15:12.651
You will help us
defuse the bomb all by yourself.


1188
01:15:13.652 --> 01:15:17.447
Bruce, I don't think
I can do it alone.

1189
01:15:18.115 --> 01:15:19.992
Yes, you can.

1190
01:15:20.075 --> 01:15:22.578
Pay attention.
You must cut the right wire.


1191
01:15:24.162 --> 01:15:26.373
Which one is the right one?

1192
01:15:26.957 --> 01:15:28.709
She doesn't know which one.

1193
01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:30.294
I won't be part of this.

1194
01:15:30.377 --> 01:15:32.671
-Then we'll die!
-It's the red one!


1195
01:15:32.754 --> 01:15:35.090
It's always the red one!

1196
01:15:35.173 --> 01:15:36.466
Celestina,

1197
01:15:37.009 --> 01:15:38.927
cut the red one!

1198
01:15:39.011 --> 01:15:39.845
Bruce,

1199
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:42.681
I have a feeling it's the green one.

1200
01:15:42.764 --> 01:15:44.850
-She said it's the green one.
-We're dead.


1201
01:15:44.933 --> 01:15:45.976
-The green one.
-Red.


1202
01:15:46.059 --> 01:15:47.894
-Green!
-Red!


1203
01:15:47.978 --> 01:15:49.563
Red!

1204
01:15:50.314 --> 01:15:52.357
Sweet Jesus!

1205
01:15:57.029 --> 01:15:59.781
Oh, Celestina!

1206
01:15:59.865 --> 01:16:01.158
I can't believe it.

1207
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:03.452
I told you she's smart.

1208
01:16:04.119 --> 01:16:06.496
Now we can get out of here.

1209
01:16:11.209 --> 01:16:13.170
-Are you okay?
-I think I broke my leg.


1210
01:16:13.253 --> 01:16:15.922
Come on, let's go! Bring her.

1211
01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:19.343
-Now, let's find Zeca Brito.
-Ouch.


1212
01:16:19.426 --> 01:16:21.053
It's over, Bruce.

1213
01:16:21.136 --> 01:16:24.514
They'll sell the drugs
right under our noses,


1214
01:16:24.598 --> 01:16:27.392
and we won't have
time to find out where.

1215
01:16:27.476 --> 01:16:28.852
Relax, I've got it.

1216
01:16:28.935 --> 01:16:33.357
If we need to find out where
those bastards are going to meet,


1217
01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:35.984
let me talk to my intelligence team.

1218
01:16:43.033 --> 01:16:44.076
Hello.

1219
01:16:44.159 --> 01:16:46.370
Who's disturbing our siesta?

1220
01:16:46.453 --> 01:16:47.412
It's Bruce.

1221
01:16:48.038 --> 01:16:51.375
Tell that idiot he
owes this town a goat.

1222
01:16:51.458 --> 01:16:53.210
Toninho, remember you told me

1223
01:16:53.293 --> 01:16:55.921
all your cousins that came to São Paulo
became criminals?


1224
01:16:56.004 --> 01:16:59.466
Yep. All of them.
Except Robson, he's hardworking.


1225
01:16:59.549 --> 01:17:00.509
So, I need you

1226
01:17:00.592 --> 01:17:02.511
to find out something for me urgently.

1227
01:17:02.594 --> 01:17:04.096
What is it? Shoot.

1228
01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:06.431
Don't worry, my best man is on it.

1229
01:17:09.476 --> 01:17:11.603
Iranete? It's Toninho!

1230
01:17:11.687 --> 01:17:14.356
Yes, from Guaramobim, Mr. 
Gonçalo's son.

1231
01:17:14.439 --> 01:17:17.484
How are you? It's
been such a long time!

1232
01:17:17.567 --> 01:17:20.070
What? Matias?

1233
01:17:20.153 --> 01:17:21.488
And where is Matias?

1234
01:17:21.571 --> 01:17:24.199
Hey, moron.
They're all collect calls, right?


1235
01:17:24.908 --> 01:17:27.744
Matias! Sorry, were you sleeping?

1236
01:17:27.828 --> 01:17:31.415
Hey, tell me something.
Any shady stuff going down today?


1237
01:17:32.207 --> 01:17:33.417
At night?

1238
01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.545
Right. Marinalva? 
Does she know?

1239
01:17:36.628 --> 01:17:40.465
Marinalva, darling, how are you?
I'll send you some rapadura.


1240
01:17:40.549 --> 01:17:42.134
Hey, Bruce? Toninho.

1241
01:17:42.217 --> 01:17:44.428
I found out everything.
I'll send you a text.


1242
01:17:47.472 --> 01:17:48.432
So?

1243
01:17:48.515 --> 01:17:50.600
This is the meeting address.

1244
01:17:50.684 --> 01:17:52.477
It's across town.

1245
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:54.604
We need backup.

1246
01:17:59.818 --> 01:18:03.488
Thank you for calling me again,
thanks for trusting me,


1247
01:18:03.572 --> 01:18:05.574
and for getting me out of dinner
with Robson's mom.


1248
01:18:05.657 --> 01:18:06.783
Okay.

1249
01:18:06.867 --> 01:18:11.663
This is a negotiation
among the country's biggest drug dealers.


1250
01:18:11.747 --> 01:18:13.123
These are the crooks.

1251
01:18:13.206 --> 01:18:15.250
Júlio Ribamar, aka Medalhinha,

1252
01:18:15.333 --> 01:18:17.294
Mato Grosso's drug lord,

1253
01:18:17.377 --> 01:18:20.213
brother of the Bolivian drug lord
Ribamar Gonzáles.


1254
01:18:20.297 --> 01:18:21.715
They're not brothers, Bruce.

1255
01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:24.050
The latter's first name
is the former's surname.


1256
01:18:24.134 --> 01:18:26.011
-Will you let me speak?
-Go on.


1257
01:18:26.094 --> 01:18:29.389
Sergei Petrov,
leader of the Russian crime family.


1258
01:18:29.473 --> 01:18:31.892
Ping Li, representing the Chinese family.

1259
01:18:31.975 --> 01:18:34.269
-He's from São Paulo.
-Yeah, whatever.


1260
01:18:34.352 --> 01:18:36.897
Ursula Schmidt, from the German family.

1261
01:18:37.481 --> 01:18:40.108
And finally, the drug ring's kingpin,

1262
01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:43.737
Deputy Zeca Brito, from Pereiro, Ceará,

1263
01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.906
code name, White Glove.

1264
01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:49.534
-It all comes down to this bust.
-This one.


1265
01:18:49.618 --> 01:18:52.496
We will go down in history, Trindade!

1266
01:18:53.246 --> 01:18:56.374
Another ride popped up.
Did you call an Uber Pool?


1267
01:18:56.458 --> 01:18:58.084
The last one was too expensive.

1268
01:18:58.168 --> 01:19:00.462
-Just cancel it.
-Sorry, no can do.


1269
01:19:00.545 --> 01:19:02.464
My rating's down to four stars.

1270
01:19:04.591 --> 01:19:06.092
So, I don't know what to do.

1271
01:19:06.176 --> 01:19:09.012
Should I talk to
him or let it go?

1272
01:19:09.513 --> 01:19:11.556
Men like that are trash.
Run while you can.


1273
01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:14.518
Robson is just like that.
I've been angry for 15 years.


1274
01:19:14.601 --> 01:19:17.354
No. You're overreacting.

1275
01:19:17.437 --> 01:19:19.648
There's so much more you have to consider.

1276
01:19:20.357 --> 01:19:22.651
-What's your zodiac sign?
-Look who's calling.


1277
01:19:22.734 --> 01:19:24.152
-Don't answer.
-I won't.


1278
01:19:24.236 --> 01:19:25.946
-Value yourself.
-I won't answer.


1279
01:19:26.029 --> 01:19:28.156
She does everything he wants.

1280
01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:30.784
-This is your work.
-I'm working!


1281
01:19:30.867 --> 01:19:32.994
Thank you, guys. Good night.

1282
01:19:33.078 --> 01:19:35.038
I'll text to let you know what happened.

1283
01:19:35.121 --> 01:19:36.206
-Good luck!
-Good night.


1284
01:19:36.289 --> 01:19:37.916
-Bye.
-Bye, Josi.


1285
01:19:37.999 --> 01:19:39.835
Bye. She's not really thin.

1286
01:19:40.961 --> 01:19:42.045
Let's go, Josimara!

1287
01:19:42.128 --> 01:19:45.382
Well, back to Operation Scapegoat.

1288
01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:53.473
The negotiation is happening
in one of those hangars.


1289
01:19:53.557 --> 01:19:55.976
Celestina will take us to the right one.

1290
01:19:56.059 --> 01:19:57.477
-Go, C.
-Come on.


1291
01:19:59.437 --> 01:20:02.065
Hey, should I stay here,
or can I accept a new ride?


1292
01:20:03.525 --> 01:20:04.442
I'll wait.

1293
01:20:06.528 --> 01:20:08.697
When Celestina
points out the right hangar,


1294
01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:11.241
we take a photo,
get the evidence, and bounce.


1295
01:20:11.324 --> 01:20:12.284
-Okay?
-Okay.


1296
01:20:12.367 --> 01:20:13.618
-Let's go.
-Go, C.


1297
01:20:15.328 --> 01:20:16.621
Ouch!

1298
01:20:29.885 --> 01:20:32.470
Trindade, I think they're in there.

1299
01:20:36.057 --> 01:20:38.727
Celestina, stay right here.

1300
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:41.146
It's too dangerous. Bye.

1301
01:20:43.023 --> 01:20:44.316
Come on.

1302
01:20:54.034 --> 01:20:55.535
Shrek 1,

1303
01:20:56.286 --> 01:20:57.329
Shrek 3…

1304
01:20:58.705 --> 01:20:59.539
What?

1305
01:21:01.041 --> 01:21:03.543
Here it is! Shrek 2.

1306
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:05.629
This is the one.

1307
01:21:09.007 --> 01:21:10.550
Here we go. It's too good.

1308
01:21:35.241 --> 01:21:38.828
Ladies and gentlemen,
I called an emergency meeting


1309
01:21:39.371 --> 01:21:40.789
to sell off my stock.

1310
01:21:40.872 --> 01:21:42.582
And where are the drugs?

1311
01:21:50.131 --> 01:21:53.718
Rapadura with flour.
The ideal mix for the northeasterners.


1312
01:21:54.594 --> 01:21:57.055
My special offer is ten reais for one,

1313
01:21:57.138 --> 01:21:59.140
30 for three, 40 for four,

1314
01:21:59.224 --> 01:22:01.393
and it's only 50
reais if you buy five,

1315
01:22:01.476 --> 01:22:03.269
to help with change.

1316
01:22:04.646 --> 01:22:05.563
Now!

1317
01:22:10.652 --> 01:22:12.320
Did you leave the flash on?

1318
01:22:12.404 --> 01:22:13.738
I don't think they saw it.

1319
01:22:14.781 --> 01:22:15.865
Yes, they did.

1320
01:22:16.783 --> 01:22:19.786
You've already hindered my plans enough.

1321
01:22:20.745 --> 01:22:22.914
-It's time for plan B.
-What's plan B?


1322
01:22:23.415 --> 01:22:25.250
There are no more plans.

1323
01:22:29.004 --> 01:22:30.338
Was that you?

1324
01:22:35.885 --> 01:22:38.179
Thunderbolt, in position!

1325
01:22:53.278 --> 01:22:54.112
How did you know?

1326
01:22:54.195 --> 01:22:56.322
Bruce and I had a date,
and he didn't show up.


1327
01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:58.199
Sorry, okay?

1328
01:22:58.283 --> 01:22:59.784
Something came up.

1329
01:23:01.077 --> 01:23:03.872
I got suspicious
and asked the team to track you down.


1330
01:23:13.465 --> 01:23:15.175
Zeca Brito is getting away!

1331
01:23:15.258 --> 01:23:16.843
Go, I'll handle the others.

1332
01:23:30.690 --> 01:23:31.775
Take care of them.

1333
01:23:32.984 --> 01:23:35.779
Trindade, go after Zeca Brito.

1334
01:23:35.862 --> 01:23:37.405
I'll take care of Ping Li.

1335
01:23:37.906 --> 01:23:38.823
Got it.

1336
01:25:07.036 --> 01:25:08.538
You do like sticks, don't you?

1337
01:25:46.534 --> 01:25:48.953
I need air.

1338
01:25:49.579 --> 01:25:51.998
I got air.

1339
01:25:56.294 --> 01:25:58.004
I told you I got air!

1340
01:26:19.567 --> 01:26:21.569
Man, it is hard to kill you!

1341
01:26:21.653 --> 01:26:23.071
It's over, Zeca Brito.

1342
01:26:23.154 --> 01:26:26.366
For whom? From what I can see,
I'm the only one holding a gun.


1343
01:26:26.449 --> 01:26:28.117
I saw you loading it.

1344
01:26:28.618 --> 01:26:30.578
You only have one bullet

1345
01:26:30.662 --> 01:26:32.205
and two targets.

1346
01:26:32.288 --> 01:26:35.875
Well, let's try your luck
and see which of you is going to die.


1347
01:26:36.668 --> 01:26:39.963
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
shoot a tiger by the toe.


1348
01:26:41.881 --> 01:26:43.841
Not me!

1349
01:27:14.372 --> 01:27:15.373
No!

1350
01:27:26.426 --> 01:27:27.593
Damn goat!

1351
01:27:28.094 --> 01:27:29.429
-Celestina!
-Celestina!


1352
01:27:29.929 --> 01:27:32.390
-Celestina!
-Celestina!


1353
01:27:34.892 --> 01:27:36.561
Celestina!

1354
01:27:37.186 --> 01:27:38.021
Celestina.

1355
01:27:55.079 --> 01:27:56.497
Zeca is escaping!

1356
01:27:57.999 --> 01:28:01.169
He can even fly a chopper. 
We're screwed.

1357
01:28:01.252 --> 01:28:04.005
No, we're not.
The game is just getting started.


1358
01:28:04.088 --> 01:28:06.257
We'll follow Zeca Brito to hell.

1359
01:28:12.221 --> 01:28:13.931
Holy moly!

1360
01:28:14.015 --> 01:28:17.101
I take it back. 
He can't fly a chopper.

1361
01:28:22.690 --> 01:28:23.524
Keep walking.

1362
01:28:24.025 --> 01:28:25.693
Give me that. Move.

1363
01:28:29.030 --> 01:28:30.573
-Amílcar.
-Hey.


1364
01:28:31.824 --> 01:28:32.742
That's all.

1365
01:28:33.618 --> 01:28:34.660
Let's take a selfie.

1366
01:28:35.703 --> 01:28:36.788
There.

1367
01:28:36.871 --> 01:28:38.331
What if Robson sees that?

1368
01:28:38.414 --> 01:28:40.625
I'll show him what big is.

1369
01:28:42.377 --> 01:28:43.836
We were right, after all.

1370
01:28:46.672 --> 01:28:48.633
You did a good job.

1371
01:28:48.716 --> 01:28:51.844
Well, not good. 
More like mediocre.

1372
01:28:51.928 --> 01:28:53.721
-Yeah.
-Actually, it was lame.


1373
01:28:53.805 --> 01:28:56.015
But I beat Ping Li all by myself.

1374
01:28:56.099 --> 01:28:58.768
-But you'd be dead if not for my team.
-Yeah.


1375
01:28:58.851 --> 01:28:59.685
But

1376
01:29:00.645 --> 01:29:02.021
it was better than I expected.

1377
01:29:02.105 --> 01:29:04.107
Not that I expected much from you.

1378
01:29:04.690 --> 01:29:06.192
Can we still get a drink?

1379
01:29:09.237 --> 01:29:10.780
You lost your chance, Officer.

1380
01:29:13.032 --> 01:29:14.325
And you!

1381
01:29:15.243 --> 01:29:18.538
Hey, Trindade, look at you!

1382
01:29:19.122 --> 01:29:20.665
What a handsome guy!

1383
01:29:20.748 --> 01:29:24.502
So well-groomed, right?
Smelling good, neat.


1384
01:29:25.294 --> 01:29:27.171
Never been shot by anyone.

1385
01:29:28.131 --> 01:29:30.049
-That's right.
-Isn't it?


1386
01:29:30.133 --> 01:29:31.676
I won the bet.

1387
01:29:32.552 --> 01:29:35.888
And again,
I will not be bringing the picanha.


1388
01:29:37.348 --> 01:29:38.391
Celestina.

1389
01:29:44.313 --> 01:29:47.024
-Is she going to be okay?
-Yes, don't worry.


1390
01:29:47.108 --> 01:29:48.860
She's a badass!

1391
01:30:03.541 --> 01:30:04.959
Today,

1392
01:30:05.042 --> 01:30:07.753
on the 30th anniversary

1393
01:30:07.837 --> 01:30:11.424
of the world's biggest rapadura festival…

1394
01:30:11.924 --> 01:30:13.176
And the only one.

1395
01:30:14.010 --> 01:30:17.221
…I have the honor of awarding

1396
01:30:17.305 --> 01:30:21.267
the best cop this town has ever seen!

1397
01:30:24.061 --> 01:30:27.356
30TH RAPADURA FESTIVAL OF GUARÁ

1398
01:30:32.487 --> 01:30:34.280
Celestina the goat,

1399
01:30:34.363 --> 01:30:36.407
I commend you

1400
01:30:36.491 --> 01:30:40.077
for your bravery on duty

1401
01:30:40.161 --> 01:30:42.413
as a police sniffer goat.

1402
01:30:51.047 --> 01:30:52.965
This goat makes me so proud.

1403
01:31:03.226 --> 01:31:04.185
Chief.

1404
01:31:04.810 --> 01:31:05.686
Bruce.

1405
01:31:06.771 --> 01:31:07.772
Congratulations.

1406
01:31:08.648 --> 01:31:09.565
Trindade…

1407
01:31:10.483 --> 01:31:13.319
-Did he stay in your house in São Paulo?
-He did.


1408
01:31:13.402 --> 01:31:15.112
Here you'll stay in mine.

1409
01:31:15.738 --> 01:31:16.948
I insist.

1410
01:31:24.288 --> 01:31:25.498
Bruce!

1411
01:31:25.581 --> 01:31:27.667
That evil-looking guy.

1412
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:29.752
He seems suspicious.

1413
01:31:29.835 --> 01:31:33.381
That's my brother Chuquinorris
and his sons, Vindiso and Derroqui.


1414
01:31:33.464 --> 01:31:35.466
Sorry, that was just force of habit.

1415
01:31:36.133 --> 01:31:38.344
We don't have these things here in Guará.

1416
01:31:38.427 --> 01:31:39.512
Which Guará?

1417
01:31:41.597 --> 01:31:43.057
He's armed!

1418
01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:45.059
Die, you sons of guns!

1419
01:31:48.854 --> 01:31:50.231
Not on our watch!
