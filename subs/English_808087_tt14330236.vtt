00:19:11.284 --> 00:19:14.321

464
00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:42.416
Luca? [screams] Oh, my God!

465
00:19:42.684 --> 00:19:45.485
Oh! Oh, my God! No, no. Wait.

466
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.823
[whimpers] What is this?
This is...


467
00:19:48.856 --> 00:19:52.459
Oh, my God, no. [whimpers]

468

[screams] Oh. Oh, my God. No.

469
00:19:55.462 --> 00:19:58.766
No, no.
Where is that guy? Luca!


470
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:00.400
Get in here, fix this!

Luca! Will somebody help me?

This is not me!
I'm not... Where am I?

Luca! [screams]
I'm not me. I'm not me.

I'm old. I'm really not okay.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

I'm not on meth, Carla. It's me.

- Ma'am, I'm serious.
- '[shrieks] Okay, please.


497
00:21:35.096 --> 00:21:36.396
[shushes] Listen. Listen.

498
00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:38.566
One more move and you get
an eyeful of pepper.


499
00:21:38.766 --> 00:21:42.369
- It stings. Trust me.
- That is empty.

No, it's not.

501
00:21:43.571 --> 00:21:45.006
Oh, I know that's empty,

502
00:21:45.039 --> 00:21:47.407
because you've had it
since college.


503
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:48.943
How you know that?

504
00:21:49.342 --> 00:21:52.547
Because we bought
those pepper sprays together


505
00:21:53.014 --> 00:21:54.916
and we tested them out
on each other,


506
00:21:55.116 --> 00:21:56.851
just to make sure
that they worked. And...


507
00:21:56.884 --> 00:21:58.119
No, no, but I'm serious!

508

You're a ghost.
Please, ghost. Go away, ghost!

- I don't know what to do.


514
00:22:13.601 --> 00:22:16.003
Something really crazy happened
to me in that regression pod,

and I don't even look
like me anymore.

But I'm me, okay? The...
Well, look, look. See? See.


517
00:22:20.708 --> 00:22:22.643
That's Mack's jewelry.
What did you do with her?


518
00:22:22.677 --> 00:22:25.478
[whimpers] What do you mean?
You gave me this bracelet.


519
00:22:25.513 --> 00:22:27.982
Because you said
all my other jewelry


520
00:22:28.015 --> 00:22:31.152
looked like I bought
it at a Judge Judy estate sale.


521
00:22:31.185 --> 00:22:33.486
Which I said is
a good thing because...


522
00:22:33.988 --> 00:22:36.123
[both] Judge Judy rich as hell.

523
00:22:36.157 --> 00:22:38.159

- I love you so much.
- Okay, okay, okay.


527
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.834
I love you, too.

- [Sun it a] Oh, my God!


530
00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:50.781
[Ali] Then I heard "ghost,"
and then I...

- [indistinct chatter]

Are you okay?
'Cause we heard screams.


535
00:22:57.712 --> 00:22:58.989
- I heard you literally scream.
- Yeah,


536
00:22:59.013 --> 00:23:00.514
just one of Betty's friends.

537
00:23:03.483 --> 00:23:05.786
- Hey.
- [shrieks, gulps]


538
00:23:06.621 --> 00:23:09.056
I'll meet you guys there.
I wanna change. I feel like...


539
00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.567
- Sure, yeah.
- Definitely change, for sure.


540
00:23:10.591 --> 00:23:12.526
- Yeah. You guys look hot.
- Thank you so much.


541
00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.670
- Thanks. You can too.
- You can, too.


542
00:23:13.694 --> 00:23:14.705
I'm trying try to get laid.

543
00:23:14.729 --> 00:23:16.063
- Okay. Thank you.
- Ooh, yeah!


544
00:23:16.264 --> 00:23:18.966
- [Ali] Nice meeting the... you.
- Okay, just get us enough seats.


545
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.677
[Ali] Okay, I want to make sure
they're not waiting.


546
00:23:20.701 --> 00:23:22.469
Okay. I need a drink.

547
00:23:22.503 --> 00:23:25.039
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah.

548
00:23:26.707 --> 00:23:29.877
This like... it's like I'm me,
but I'm not me.


549
00:23:29.911 --> 00:23:32.813
I mean, I'm me way up here.
But these things here,


550
00:23:32.847 --> 00:23:34.815
like, I had them.
They're not mine.


551
00:23:34.849 --> 00:23:38.853
Mine were like normal size.
Ah, this is horrible.


552
00:23:38.886 --> 00:23:41.088
Okay, so what were
you thinking about


553
00:23:41.122 --> 00:23:43.824
when he was asking you
who you wanted to be?


554
00:23:43.858 --> 00:23:46.594
Well, I was thinking
about Grammie Martin,


555
00:23:46.794 --> 00:23:50.463
and about how sick
of all the bullshit I am. And...


556
00:23:50.497 --> 00:23:52.633
Okay, so you were thinking
about old lady stuff


557
00:23:52.667 --> 00:23:54.544
- and then you turned into one.
- [Mack] Uh-huh.


558
00:23:54.568 --> 00:23:56.537
So, he should be able
to turn you back into you.


559
00:23:56.837 --> 00:23:59.140
Oh, God, this is really
a nightmare.


560
00:23:59.173 --> 00:24:03.077
My hair is different.
It's, like, really weird.


561
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.145
Look at this.

562
00:24:04.444 --> 00:24:06.847
It feels like it's well-coated
wire or something.


563
00:24:06.881 --> 00:24:08.516
- [chuckles]
- It's not hair.


564
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:10.785
- Mack, we're going to fix this.
- [grunts]


565
00:24:10.818 --> 00:24:12.053
I'm just really tired

566
00:24:12.086 --> 00:24:13.788
and overwhelmed,
and I need to rest.


567
00:24:13.821 --> 00:24:15.623
I just don't know how
to explain this to you.


568
00:24:15.656 --> 00:24:19.226
But you know what I can feel?
I can, like, feel the bones.


569
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.594
We're gonna figure this out.

570
00:24:20.628 --> 00:24:22.196
Yeah. And if we don't, you know,

571
00:24:22.229 --> 00:24:24.497
I'll just lose my friends
and my sponsors,


572
00:24:24.532 --> 00:24:25.909
- and I'll just run outta money.
- [Carla] No.


573
00:24:25.933 --> 00:24:27.868
And I'll be one of those
old people, you know,


574
00:24:27.902 --> 00:24:30.204
that dies in their apartment
and turns into flesh soup


575
00:24:30.404 --> 00:24:32.206
because nobody finds
them for weeks.


576
00:24:32.239 --> 00:24:34.675
Okay, I'm not gonna
let you turn into flesh soup.


577
00:24:34.875 --> 00:24:36.844
- Really?
- Really.


578
00:24:37.745 --> 00:24:39.647
I'm gonna call my mom,

579
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.750
and ask her if we can use
Betty's house another few days.


580
00:24:42.783 --> 00:24:45.186
But wait a minute. Whoa!
What about your shower?


581
00:24:45.219 --> 00:24:47.288
I'll cancel it.
This is a little more important.


582
00:24:47.321 --> 00:24:50.124
No, no, no, I'm sorry.
No, you're not going to cancel


583
00:24:50.157 --> 00:24:52.126
- anything at all.
- [gentle music playing]


584
00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:54.128
I got an idea.
Here's what we're gonna do.


585
00:24:54.494 --> 00:24:56.564
You're gonna drive
the girls back to LA,


586
00:24:56.597 --> 00:24:58.141
and you just tell them that,
I don't know,


587
00:24:58.165 --> 00:24:59.800
some sort of
a work thing came up.


588
00:25:00.034 --> 00:25:01.802
Anyway, I will go back
into town,


589
00:25:01.836 --> 00:25:03.637
and I will see
if I can find him,


590
00:25:03.671 --> 00:25:06.540
and I'll be back in LA
in time for your shower.


591
00:25:06.574 --> 00:25:08.242
You don't want me
to come with you?


592
00:25:08.275 --> 00:25:09.810
[crickets chirping]

593
00:25:09.844 --> 00:25:10.878
No.

594
00:25:11.579 --> 00:25:14.015
I just think I need
to be alone right now.


595
00:25:14.715 --> 00:25:18.119
This is... Whoo...
A lot to process.


596
00:25:18.152 --> 00:25:20.554
And you're sure
there's nothing I can do?


597
00:25:21.022 --> 00:25:23.791
Could you drive me somewhere
to rent a car? [chuckles]


598
00:25:25.026 --> 00:25:26.627
- I have a better idea.
- Hmm?


599
00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.030
Get some rest tonight.
I got you.

Oh, my God. No, no.

Knix just slid into my DMs.

1497
01:00:35.669 --> 01:00:37.771
They saw my post
from the Pilates party,


1498
01:00:37.805 --> 01:00:41.275
and, my God, they want me
to be a brand ambassador.


1499
01:00:41.709 --> 01:00:44.178
Yeah, they said,
"We've been looking for..."

[giggles] "...a fierce,
sophisticated woman

to slay on their feed!"

01:00:49.884 --> 01:00:51.886
Oh, that sounds pretty dope.

1503
01:00:51.919 --> 01:00:55.222
It is. It is so dope! Man!

1504

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, wait a minute.

Oh, oh, wait a minute.

They're... they're offering

01:01:03.097 --> 01:01:05.466
exclusive engagement fee.

1508
01:01:05.499 --> 01:01:07.468
- Whoa, 100,000 dollars?
- Oh, my God.


1509
01:01:07.501 --> 01:01:09.236
You can take half
of that into an IRA


1510
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:10.481
and the rest in
a simple index fund,

from a man

Now please respond to this.

Well, of course.
That goes without saying.

- This is very cool, Rita.

- Yeah, that's a good idea.

Yeah, yeah. I'm just gonna
go grab my laptop, I'll...

- No, no, no, no.

...romantically interested kiss.

1553

Stop! Carla, I just kind of said
to myself, "You go for it,"


1554
01:02:56.143 --> 01:02:58.145
because when have
I ever even done that?


1555
01:02:58.178 --> 01:03:01.081
Initiate a kiss?
It's like a first kiss?


1556
01:03:01.115 --> 01:03:03.017
I just don't even
do things like that.

the only one with a surprise.

Well, yeah. I mean,
I'm really good.

Yeah, Mack.

Everything that's happening
for you right now

I'll be right back.

in the middle of something,

so can I call you back?

1575
01:03:48.929 --> 01:03:50.497
Knix needs Rita

to appear at
the <i>Marie Claire</i> Power Summit.

It's a big deal.

Friday. They need me
to confirm today.

Oh, wow. I mean,
that is so cool.


1580
01:04:01.942 --> 01:04:05.012
- But what is that anyway?
- [Stephanie] <i>Oh, I don't know,</i>


1581
01:04:05.045 --> 01:04:08.516
just a major event that
celebrates the power of women


1582
01:04:08.550 --> 01:04:10.417
thrown by a publication
you would die to have


1583
01:04:10.451 --> 01:04:12.052
your little,
stinky pieces run in?


1584
01:04:12.086 --> 01:04:13.229
- [chuckles] Oh.
- [Stephanie] <i>Knix</i>

1586
01:04:14.656 --> 01:04:18.092
and they wanna roll out
Rita's ambassadorship with them.


1587
01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:19.561
I really can't. I...

1588
01:04:19.594 --> 01:04:21.371
I mean, that's the night
of Carla's rehearsal dinner.


1589
01:04:21.395 --> 01:04:23.139
[Stephanie] <i>Yeah,</i>
<i>I don't think they really care</i>


1590
01:04:23.163 --> 01:04:24.965
if you're there.

1591
01:04:24.998 --> 01:04:27.110
I mean, you could go if you
want to get a swag bag of,


1592
01:04:27.134 --> 01:04:28.536
<i>like, free yoni eggs
or something,</i>


1593
01:04:28.570 --> 01:04:30.437
but Knix has made it
crystal clear


1594
01:04:30.672 --> 01:04:32.674
that the event is mandatory
for Rita.


1595
01:04:32.707 --> 01:04:35.309
So, please make sure she shows.

[traffic rumbling]

1600
01:04:48.088 --> 01:04:50.357
- [Jack] Hey.
- Hey, nice robe.


1601
01:04:50.391 --> 01:04:52.259
Thanks. Wore it home
from the spa.


1602
01:04:52.292 --> 01:04:54.696
Um, I just don't understand
how someone


1603
01:04:54.729 --> 01:04:58.600
so handsome, thank you,
could be quite so strange.


1604
01:04:58.833 --> 01:05:00.535
Well, I was, uh,

1605
01:05:00.568 --> 01:05:02.002
in the fifth percentile
for weight


1606
01:05:02.035 --> 01:05:03.971
- until I was, like, 17, so...
- Oh.


1607
01:05:04.004 --> 01:05:06.273
My personality just developed
before my looks.


1608
01:05:06.306 --> 01:05:08.175
And so that explains everything.

1609
01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:10.010
- Yeah. Shall I?
- Yeah.


1610
01:05:10.043 --> 01:05:11.945
Oh, yeah. Oh, yes.

1611
01:05:13.748 --> 01:05:15.916
- So, how was your day?
- [Rita] So...


1612
01:05:16.483 --> 01:05:18.952
What, uh... what's going on?
You all right?


1613
01:05:18.986 --> 01:05:21.623
- You have a rough day or what?
- Oh, yeah, I just...


1614
01:05:21.656 --> 01:05:25.259
Oh, God. I have
to make a big decision


1615
01:05:25.292 --> 01:05:27.629
and I just hate
making big decisions.


1616
01:05:29.531 --> 01:05:32.534
Mm. That's so weird
because I love big decisions.


1617
01:05:32.567 --> 01:05:34.234
- Hit me.
- Okay. I...


1618
01:05:34.935 --> 01:05:38.038
So, there's this big
Knix partner event


1619
01:05:38.071 --> 01:05:41.509
on the same day
as Carla's rehearsal dinner.


1620
01:05:41.543 --> 01:05:43.410
So, skip the rehearsal dinner.

1621
01:05:43.444 --> 01:05:47.047
Well, Jack, I mean, that's
a really huge thing to skip.


1622
01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.017
I've never gotten married
before, but if I did,


1623
01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:51.394
I don't think that
I would care that much


1624
01:05:51.418 --> 01:05:54.254
if my best friend's
aunt wasn't there.


1625
01:05:54.288 --> 01:05:55.456
- I can't miss it.
- Okay,


1626
01:05:55.489 --> 01:05:56.691
well, then skip the event.

1627
01:05:56.925 --> 01:05:59.761
No, but I... but, you know,
then I'll lose my contract.


1628
01:05:59.794 --> 01:06:03.230
I'll lose the 100,000 dollars.

1629
01:06:03.964 --> 01:06:07.034
Uh, okay.
Do you have the contract?


1630
01:06:07.067 --> 01:06:08.411
Can I... can I see
the paperwork on it?


1631
01:06:08.435 --> 01:06:09.737
- Yeah, no...
- On your phone?


1632
01:06:09.771 --> 01:06:11.181
Oh, that... You don't have
to do that.


1633
01:06:11.205 --> 01:06:12.583
No, I'm... I'm very good
at this kinda thing.


1634
01:06:12.607 --> 01:06:13.784
- Trust me.
- Oh. Yeah, no. Okay.


1635
01:06:13.808 --> 01:06:15.275
- Yeah.
- Sure. Of course.


1636
01:06:15.309 --> 01:06:17.044

to and... and what you can't.

1787
01:12:01.622 --> 01:12:04.826
And I set myself on fire.
I know. It's crazy.


1788
01:12:10.397 --> 01:12:12.700
[sighs] I'm not gonna lie, Mack.

1789
01:12:12.733 --> 01:12:16.904
I'm really, really bummed
you didn't make it tonight.


1790
01:12:17.672 --> 01:12:20.875
You missed my rehearsal dinner
for an influencer event?


1791
01:12:22.043 --> 01:12:25.112
- You're my maid of honor.
- I... I know. I...


1792
01:12:25.546 --> 01:12:27.915
You've been my best friend
my whole life.


1793
01:12:27.949 --> 01:12:30.885
And I've loved
every single version of you.


1794
01:12:31.152 --> 01:12:34.989
But right now,
Mack, Rita, whatever,


1795
01:12:35.422 --> 01:12:38.526
I don't recognize the person
standing in front of me.


1796
01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:41.128
And it has nothing to do
with what you look like.


1797
01:12:41.162 --> 01:12:43.865
I'm... I'm so sorry, Carla.

1798
01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:49.637
The one thing we've always done
for one another is show up.


1799
01:12:50.037 --> 01:12:54.508
You didn't do that tonight.
And it just really makes me sad.

Oh, God.

1804
01:13:07.121 --> 01:13:08.990
I don't know
what I'm doing half the time.


1805
01:13:09.023 --> 01:13:10.524
[sniffles]

1806
01:13:27.141 --> 01:13:30.111
Hey, thought I'd find you
up here.


1807
01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:31.184
- Is everything okay?
- Oh.


1808
01:13:31.846 --> 01:13:32.947
Yeah.

1809
01:13:33.413 --> 01:13:34.715
- Hey.
- What?


1810
01:13:34.749 --> 01:13:36.217
Rita, look at me.

1811
01:13:36.250 --> 01:13:37.818
- [crying] Please, Jack.
- Whoa, whoa.


1812
01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:39.587
Hey, hey, hey.
No. It's okay. It's okay.


1813
01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:41.231
Look, you don't have to be
embarrassed in front of me.


1814
01:13:41.255 --> 01:13:42.623
- [Rita] No.
- Here, here.


1815
01:13:43.691 --> 01:13:45.760
Thank you. I'm sorry.

1816
01:13:45.793 --> 01:13:48.029
I'm just so really frustrated
with who I am right now.


1817
01:13:48.696 --> 01:13:51.766
Because I haven't always been
like this, Jack, you see.


1818
01:13:52.366 --> 01:13:55.803
You know, I thought, like,
being in a different place,


1819
01:13:55.836 --> 01:13:57.538
you know,
it'd help me feel better.


1820
01:13:57.939 --> 01:13:59.774
You know, it'd help me
be a better person.


1821
01:14:00.408 --> 01:14:05.980
But today, I was worse, just...
I was a bad friend.


1822
01:14:06.013 --> 01:14:08.616
It just sounds
like you had a really bad day,


1823
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:11.786
but that doesn't make
you a bad person.


1824
01:14:12.186 --> 01:14:13.921
- Jack...
- No, you are one


1825
01:14:13.955 --> 01:14:15.923
of the best people
that I've ever met.


1826
01:14:15.957 --> 01:14:18.059
Why? Why are you
being so nice to me?


1827
01:14:18.092 --> 01:14:20.194
[cries] Why? Huh?

1828
01:14:22.763 --> 01:14:26.167
- Don't do that.
- Because I like you.


1829
01:14:29.704 --> 01:14:32.673
What's the matter
with you anyway? Huh?


1830
01:14:32.707 --> 01:14:34.542
I mean, you want,
like, a full list?


1831
01:14:34.575 --> 01:14:36.577
No, no, I'm really serious.

1832
01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:40.681
You spent the past month
hanging out with an old lady


1833
01:14:40.715 --> 01:14:42.883
like she's your girlfriend
or something.


1834
01:14:42.917 --> 01:14:45.019
What are you trying
to avoid, Jack?


1835
01:14:45.052 --> 01:14:46.620
Nothing. [scoffs]

1836
01:14:47.487 --> 01:14:49.557
Listen, I know that my life
doesn't look like


1837
01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:51.134
what you think a 40-year-old's
life should look like,


1838
01:14:51.158 --> 01:14:52.893
but I love it.

1839
01:14:52.927 --> 01:14:55.763
And I have done enough therapy
to know that I like myself.


1840
01:14:55.796 --> 01:14:58.232
And when I met you, I saw
someone who was comfortable


1841
01:14:58.265 --> 01:15:01.802
being exactly who they are.
And I know that...


1842
01:15:03.204 --> 01:15:04.815
You know, you're not going
to be here forever.


1843
01:15:04.839 --> 01:15:06.316
You've got your own
life to go back to.


1844
01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:10.644
Exactly. I have a life, Jack.

1845
01:15:11.112 --> 01:15:13.280
And I've lost sight
of who I really am.


1846
01:15:13.314 --> 01:15:14.849
Do you understand what I mean?

1847
01:15:14.882 --> 01:15:16.684
I mean,
I can't really stay here.


1848
01:15:16.717 --> 01:15:19.120
I just can't stay here, Jack.
I can't do that anymore.

Wha-oh!

1853
01:15:43.811 --> 01:15:45.846
You wanna tell us
what's going on...


1854
01:15:46.113 --> 01:15:47.248
Mack?

1855
01:15:50.117 --> 01:15:52.286
[Angela] Well, I need a refill.
Anyone else?


1856
01:15:52.521 --> 01:15:55.890
Yeah. If what
you just said is true,


1857
01:15:55.923 --> 01:15:58.893
I cannot possibly tell
you how stupid you sound.


1858
01:15:58.926 --> 01:16:02.596
- Nobody wants to be old.
- No, no. Sure they do.


1859
01:16:02.797 --> 01:16:04.165
Yes.

1860
01:16:04.198 --> 01:16:06.867
My grammie used to always say
this thing about, like,


1861
01:16:06.901 --> 01:16:09.737
how when you're old, you get
the best seat at the table.


1862
01:16:09.770 --> 01:16:11.272
Oh, you get any seat
at the table,


1863
01:16:11.305 --> 01:16:13.040
because people know
your bones hurt.


1864
01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.742
[women laugh]

1865
01:16:14.775 --> 01:16:16.610
You get the best seat
at the table


1866
01:16:16.644 --> 01:16:21.115
because you realize
what you want and don't want.


1867
01:16:21.148 --> 01:16:23.317
And maybe the best seat
at the table


1868
01:16:23.584 --> 01:16:26.887
is in the other damn room,
where you're 30.


1869
01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:28.789
- [women laugh]
- [Sharon] Right.


1870
01:16:28.823 --> 01:16:32.126
Rita, I... I mean Mack.
You know those 30 years


1871
01:16:32.159 --> 01:16:35.229
you skipped so that you could,
uh, maybe wear, uh,


1872
01:16:35.262 --> 01:16:37.364
elastic waistbands
and, uh, whatever?


1873
01:16:37.566 --> 01:16:38.899
[women snickering]

1874
01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:41.836
Those are the good years.
Those are the you years.


1875
01:16:41.869 --> 01:16:44.238
And you really don't want
to skip those.


1876
01:16:44.271 --> 01:16:46.674
- [Carla] Nuh-uh.
- The 30 after that,


1877
01:16:46.707 --> 01:16:49.677
they're good, too.
But, oh, those middle years...


1878
01:16:49.710 --> 01:16:50.845
Oh, man. Mwah!

1879
01:16:50.878 --> 01:16:53.647
[Sharon] It's not magic,
sweetheart.


1880
01:16:53.681 --> 01:16:55.950
- It's just work.
- Oh.


1881
01:16:55.983 --> 01:16:59.086
You? You had
to work on yourself?


1882
01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.321
Oh.

1883
01:17:00.754 --> 01:17:03.791
I was married
to a man named Steve.


1884
01:17:04.291 --> 01:17:08.896
And then I spent my middle age
building a home


1885
01:17:08.929 --> 01:17:10.931
with a woman named Tina, so...

1886
01:17:10.965 --> 01:17:11.999
- Tina.
- [Angela] Mm-hmm.


1887
01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:18.172
Yeah, I did some work.
[chuckles] Mack, sweetheart,


1888
01:17:18.973 --> 01:17:24.912
you didn't want to be old.
What you wanted was to be you.


1889
01:17:24.945 --> 01:17:26.113
[women] Mm-hmm.

1890
01:17:28.749 --> 01:17:29.817
[sighs]

[paper rustles]

1892
01:17:35.022 --> 01:17:36.891
- I gotta go, okay?
- [Sharon] You got to go.


1893
01:17:36.924 --> 01:17:38.459
- [Carla] You go, girl.
- Yeah.


1894
01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:41.395
You girls lock it up
on your way out, okay?


1895
01:17:41.428 --> 01:17:43.063
And get that hair
out of your face.


1896
01:17:43.097 --> 01:17:44.732
[Rita] I'm trying.

1897
01:17:44.765 --> 01:17:46.176
- Okay, now I'll have some more.
- Oh, yeah, baby.

[pensive music playing]

1900
01:18:03.751 --> 01:18:07.021
[Rita] Oh, yeah, right.
Okay. Wow.


1901
01:18:10.057 --> 01:18:11.325
[groans]

1902
01:18:15.129 --> 01:18:17.965
Okay. Okay, hell. Okay.

1903
01:18:19.333 --> 01:18:22.169
Luca! Luca!

1904
01:18:22.203 --> 01:18:24.438
Where are you,
you son of a bitch?


1905
01:18:24.738 --> 01:18:27.107
Luca! Luca!

1906
01:18:28.242 --> 01:18:30.978
Luca! Lu... oh!

1907
01:18:31.478 --> 01:18:34.181
- Do you have an appointment?
- No. No, Luca.


1908
01:18:34.215 --> 01:18:35.535
I don't have
an appointment, Luca.


1909
01:18:35.983 --> 01:18:37.885
Okay, you're coming in
with a lot of energy.


1910
01:18:37.918 --> 01:18:39.296
- We don't really do that here.
- Uh-huh. Really?


1911
01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.480
You didn't turn me into this?

1912
01:18:40.689 --> 01:18:42.856
I happen to be
a 30-year-old woman...


1913
01:18:43.057 --> 01:18:46.160
- Keep it down.
- ...and this is not my face!


1914
01:18:46.193 --> 01:18:47.928
- Mm.
- And this is not my hair.


1915
01:18:47.962 --> 01:18:49.463
And guess what?
This is not my body!


1916
01:18:49.496 --> 01:18:50.907
Okay, look, lady.
I don't know what drugs


1917
01:18:50.931 --> 01:18:52.209
- you're on right now...
- You did this to me!


1918
01:18:52.233 --> 01:18:53.801
But this is
an old broken tanning bed


1919
01:18:53.834 --> 01:18:55.970
I got off Craigslist.
It doesn't do anything, okay?


1920
01:18:56.003 --> 01:18:57.404
But wait a second, sir.

1921
01:18:57.672 --> 01:19:01.141
In Palm Springs,
I laid down in that pod,


1922
01:19:01.175 --> 01:19:04.311
and when I came out,
I was in this body.


1923
01:19:04.345 --> 01:19:06.380
Okay, I'm gonna go get you
a cup of water. Maybe...


1924
01:19:06.413 --> 01:19:07.881
No, no, no! Don't you dare!

1925
01:19:08.282 --> 01:19:09.416
You get over here.
You open


1926
01:19:09.450 --> 01:19:10.784
that tin can up right now.

1927
01:19:10.818 --> 01:19:12.052
- All right.
- Yes!


1928
01:19:12.086 --> 01:19:13.196
All right.
Stop yelling at me. Jesus.


1929
01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.321
What?

1930
01:19:14.723 --> 01:19:18.192
- Just get in. It's...
- [Rita] Oh. Oh, my God.


1931
01:19:18.225 --> 01:19:19.426
- Go.
- [groans]


1932
01:19:21.028 --> 01:19:22.196
- [Luca] Okay.

[machine hissing, powering on]

1934
01:19:24.765 --> 01:19:26.166
I'm sorry I yelled at you, lady.

1935
01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.402
That... that was
not very Zen of me.


1936
01:19:28.435 --> 01:19:31.272
Come on. Work, okay? Work!

1937
01:19:31.305 --> 01:19:33.440
It's okay. Just calm down.

1938
01:19:33.474 --> 01:19:36.877
Relax. [inhales] Breathe.

[mystical music playing]

1940
01:19:38.513 --> 01:19:40.881
You're not saying
your whole spiel.


1941
01:19:40.914 --> 01:19:42.216
Please just say it.

1942
01:19:42.249 --> 01:19:45.119
- Please.
- Think about who you are.


1943
01:19:47.187 --> 01:19:48.255
Come on.

1944
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:50.710
- Think about who you wanna be.
- Work, damn it! Work.


1945
01:19:52.192 --> 01:19:53.327
Come on.

1946
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.429
Life can take you
on a winding path


1947
01:19:55.462 --> 01:19:57.264
that often moves
in both directions.


1948
01:19:57.298 --> 01:19:58.533
Come on!

1949
01:19:58.566 --> 01:20:00.501
It's important to
remember that...


1950
01:20:00.535 --> 01:20:03.404
- [Rita] Okay.
- ...time is merely a construct.


1951
01:20:03.437 --> 01:20:05.172
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.


1952
01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:09.476
- [Luca] Who you are...
- [air whooshing]


1953
01:20:11.111 --> 01:20:12.514
...who you were...

01:20:12.946 --> 01:20:16.283
[electricity crackling]

1955
01:20:16.651 --> 01:20:18.352
[Luca] Who you're going to be...

[dramatic music playing]

1957
01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:23.824

you at this very moment.

[gasps] Oh, yes.

1963
01:20:58.292 --> 01:21:02.396
Yes! Yes! Oh,
I missed you. I missed you.


1964
01:21:02.896 --> 01:21:07.234
Oh, my God. Hah! [giggles]

1965
01:21:07.267 --> 01:21:08.369
Whoa!

[chuckles, squeals, gasps]

1967
01:21:13.675 --> 01:21:16.578
Oh! [breathing heavily]

- [squealing]
- [Luca] This thing...


1969
01:21:20.447 --> 01:21:22.517
[cheering] Yes!

1970
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:24.619
- [sighs] Oh.
- [cheery music playing]

1972
01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:31.091
I'm back. I'm back.

1973
01:21:33.561 --> 01:21:35.496
[squeals] Thank you. Thank you.

1974
01:21:35.530 --> 01:21:37.541
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- What just happened?


1975
01:21:37.565 --> 01:21:38.666
I know. It's crazy!

1976
01:21:39.734 --> 01:21:41.301
I need to go. I have to go.

1977
01:21:41.502 --> 01:21:42.570
Thank you!

1978
01:21:44.606 --> 01:21:47.241
- You're welcome.

[both squealing]

1985
01:22:08.763 --> 01:22:10.397
[Mack] Don't cry.

01:22:11.064 --> 01:22:14.168
- [gasping]
- [Sharon] She's happy.


1987
01:22:14.602 --> 01:22:17.438
- [grunts] Well...
- I'm gonna cry.


1988
01:22:17.471 --> 01:22:19.473
Don't cry.
You're getting married.


1989
01:22:19.507 --> 01:22:21.676
Oh, my God.
You look so beautiful.


1990
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:24.612
- Oh, my gosh.
- I kinda miss the gray.


1991
01:22:25.112 --> 01:22:27.448
I know. Me, too. [chuckles]

1992
01:22:27.481 --> 01:22:29.551
Oh, it's so good

1993
01:22:29.584 --> 01:22:32.186
to see you,
sweetheart. [chuckles]


1994
01:22:37.559 --> 01:22:40.662
- Hi!
- [women cheer, laugh]


1995
01:22:41.028 --> 01:22:44.131
- I thought you were dead!
- [indistinct chatter]


1996
01:22:44.331 --> 01:22:45.365
Go change.

1997
01:22:45.399 --> 01:22:46.577
Yes.
'Cause you are wearing white


1998
01:22:46.601 --> 01:22:48.044
and jeans at a wedding,
and that's crazy.


1999
01:22:48.068 --> 01:22:49.369
Close your mouth, honey.

2000
01:22:51.405 --> 01:22:53.040
- We did it.

Ooh, ooh, yeah. [chuckles]

[footsteps approaching]

2005
01:23:16.831 --> 01:23:18.566
Oh! Uh, hey.

2006
01:23:18.999 --> 01:23:20.735
- Hey.
- Hey. Uh...


2007

[chuckles]

2008
01:23:22.770 --> 01:23:27.040
- Whoo, sorry. Hey, you.
- [chuckles]


2009
01:23:27.074 --> 01:23:28.743
I'm sorry. It is...
It's weird


2010
01:23:28.776 --> 01:23:30.244
that I'm here right now.

2011
01:23:30.277 --> 01:23:31.613
I... I realize that.

2012
01:23:31.646 --> 01:23:35.215
I just... I didn't know if Rita...
She's... she's gone.


2013
01:23:35.249 --> 01:23:38.118
Oh, yeah. We swapped back.

2014
01:23:38.151 --> 01:23:41.054
Apartments, which is what
we swapped in the first place.


2015
01:23:41.088 --> 01:23:44.324
So, yeah, she's in,
uh, Scottsdale.


2016
01:23:44.358 --> 01:23:46.995
Seriously? I never
even got to say goodbye.


2017
01:23:47.562 --> 01:23:50.598
We, um... Yeah, we just kind
of were hanging out


2018
01:23:50.632 --> 01:23:51.712
while she was staying here.

2019
01:23:52.366 --> 01:23:55.637
Oh? Hanging out?

2020
01:23:55.670 --> 01:23:58.405
Well, we just both
had nothing to do,


2021
01:23:58.438 --> 01:24:01.141
so we did nothing together.

2022
01:24:02.309 --> 01:24:03.377
[giggles]

2023
01:24:03.745 --> 01:24:07.114
She's, um, really not like
anyone I've ever met before.


2024
01:24:07.147 --> 01:24:10.718
[romantic music playing]

2025
01:24:10.952 --> 01:24:14.822
Well... [breathes deeply]
...for what it's worth,


2026
01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:19.561
she told me that
you were really cool, too.


2027
01:24:19.994 --> 01:24:22.597
Maybe a little
too old for a skateboard.


2028
01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:24.264
She said that? I...

2029
01:24:24.298 --> 01:24:26.109
I mean, the... the first thing,
about being cool?


2030
01:24:26.133 --> 01:24:28.135
Because I knew how she felt
about my skateboard.


2031
01:24:28.502 --> 01:24:30.805
Yeah. She did.

2032
01:24:32.306 --> 01:24:33.306
Cool.

2033
01:24:34.042 --> 01:24:35.810
You think she's ever
coming back?


2034
01:24:37.311 --> 01:24:39.313
Someday, maybe.

2035
01:24:39.614 --> 01:24:41.783
But not for a really,
really long time.


2036
01:24:43.785 --> 01:24:44.852
Okay.

2037
01:24:45.252 --> 01:24:49.356
Uh, if you do talk to her,
please just tell her I said hi.


2038
01:24:49.389 --> 01:24:50.457
I will.

2039
01:24:53.493 --> 01:24:54.562
[burps]

2040
01:24:54.929 --> 01:24:58.766
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
Sorry. I, um... ugh!


2041
01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.269
I had too many shrimp.
But they were the big ones.


2042
01:25:02.302 --> 01:25:05.138
The jumbo, like, for sure
genetically engineered ones?


2043
01:25:05.172 --> 01:25:06.249
For sure genetically
engineered ones.


2044
01:25:06.273 --> 01:25:07.273
Yeah.

2045
01:25:09.877 --> 01:25:11.111
[chuckles]

2046
01:25:13.815 --> 01:25:14.882
Okay.

2047
01:25:27.562 --> 01:25:28.630
[door closes]

2048
01:25:36.771 --> 01:25:39.874
[crickets chirping]

[indistinct chatter]

2050
01:25:48.549 --> 01:25:51.184
[gasps] Congrats on
your new book.


2051
01:25:51.218 --> 01:25:53.387
You know, I've been seeing
a lot of people


2052
01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:55.790
posting pictures of it
on their legs on the beach


2053
01:25:55.823 --> 01:25:58.760
- and they call that hotdogging.
- Oh, very cool.


2054
01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.461
I gotta be honest,
I kind of miss Rita.


2055
01:26:01.495 --> 01:26:04.666
Her French exit from the feed
was one of the sexiest things


2056
01:26:04.699 --> 01:26:07.535
I've ever seen,
and I've seen porn.


2057
01:26:07.735 --> 01:26:08.736
Mm-hmm.

2058
01:26:09.137 --> 01:26:12.305
Also, thank you for recommending
the Instagrammies to me.


2059
01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:16.678
The drunkest one, she has
over 500,000 followers


2060
01:26:16.711 --> 01:26:18.245
and it just makes me be like,

2061
01:26:18.278 --> 01:26:19.781
"What have you
ever done for me?"


2062
01:26:19.814 --> 01:26:22.215
Oh, yeah. They're...
They're awesome.


2063
01:26:22.249 --> 01:26:23.785
[cellphone ringing]

2064
01:26:23.818 --> 01:26:26.319
Oh, wait. S... s...
Co... yeah, copy that.


2065
01:26:26.554 --> 01:26:27.622
Okay.

2066
01:26:30.792 --> 01:26:31.826
Hi!

2067
01:26:33.861 --> 01:26:34.929
[gasps]

2068
01:26:35.730 --> 01:26:38.833
Thank you so much
for coming. [chuckles]


2069
01:26:39.433 --> 01:26:42.770
Hi, bebe. I'm so proud of you.

2070
01:26:46.874 --> 01:26:49.342
[crowd] Ooh!

2071
01:26:49.911 --> 01:26:51.831
- All right, you ready? Ready?
- Yes. Yes, sorry.


2072
01:26:51.913 --> 01:26:53.322
All right, everyone,
let's get jazzed


2073
01:26:53.346 --> 01:26:56.283
- for this reading.
- [cheering]


2074
01:26:56.316 --> 01:26:58.351
- Yeah.
- [woman 3] You go, girl.


2075
01:26:58.385 --> 01:27:01.354
Um, so that's me,
right? Uh... [chuckles]


2076
01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:04.826
Hi. Uh, thank you
all for coming.


2077
01:27:04.859 --> 01:27:06.027
[woman 4] Uh-uh.

2078
01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:09.597
I... I really... I wanted
to share this book


2079
01:27:09.630 --> 01:27:13.300
with the people in my life
who mean the most to me.


2080
01:27:13.333 --> 01:27:17.337
My first book was a series
of essays about my grandma.


2081
01:27:17.370 --> 01:27:18.673
[uplifting music playing]

2082
01:27:18.706 --> 01:27:20.440
And until very recently,

2083
01:27:22.409 --> 01:27:24.579
she was
the only person in my life


2084
01:27:24.612 --> 01:27:29.449
who made me feel like
I had license to be myself.


2085
01:27:29.483 --> 01:27:30.885
And when she died,

2086
01:27:32.620 --> 01:27:35.790
I... I thought
that I had lost that.


2087

I, uh...

2088
01:27:38.526 --> 01:27:43.998
[sighs] I had a really hard time
feeling like I was enough.

so much about, you know,

01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:52.507
all the things that made me, me.

2091
01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:57.645
That they were
too weird, too different,


2092
01:27:57.678 --> 01:28:00.681
and not fun, not cool.

2093
01:28:00.882 --> 01:28:04.552
[chuckles] And it took a, uh...

2094
01:28:06.386 --> 01:28:09.557
a near-death experience

2095
01:28:11.025 --> 01:28:13.961
to realize that that's not true.

2096
01:28:16.130 --> 01:28:20.333
I realized that the people
in my life who I love...


2097
01:28:20.735 --> 01:28:23.738
Love those things about me, too.

2098
01:28:23.771 --> 01:28:27.440
And believing that gave me
the confidence


2099
01:28:28.609 --> 01:28:31.846
to show myself,
you know, to new people.
