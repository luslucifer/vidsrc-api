Yeah!

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.129
What's up, DC?

[audience chuckles]

13
00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:07.639
Man, every time I come out,

14
00:01:07.723 --> 00:01:10.475
and a bunch of white people
scream at me, I just can't.


15
00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:11.810
[audience laughs]

16
00:01:11.893 --> 00:01:13.895
I felt like I made it!

18
00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:19.943
Whoo!

19
00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:23.697
I mean, like, I am white-people famous,
you know what I'm saying?


20
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.868
Yo, y'all lose your mind
when y'all meet me, too.


21
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:29.703
Lose your shit!

22
00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.789
[yelling] "Oh, my God!

23
00:01:32.873 --> 00:01:34.958
Leslie Jones!"

24
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.672
I be like, "Bitch, we are in Starbucks.
You need to calm the fuck down.


25
00:01:40.756 --> 00:01:42.174
Calm down."

26
00:01:44.885 --> 00:01:47.804
Black people do not react
to me like that at all.


27
00:01:48.764 --> 00:01:51.308
Black people think they famous
in their own mind.


28
00:01:52.476 --> 00:01:54.478
They're like,
"Bitch, my album's out next week.


29
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:57.147
You want to get this selfie, bitch?

30
00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.483
I am famous, too, bitch."

31
00:02:03.278 --> 00:02:05.238
I love all that shit, man.

32
00:02:05.781 --> 00:02:08.450
I turned 52 this weekend. Yeah!

33
00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:09.951
[audience cheering]

34
00:02:11.244 --> 00:02:12.371
Damn right!

35
00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:17.167
Y'all know I don't care.
I got my knee brace on the outside.


36
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.295
I don't give a fuck. 
I don't give a fuck.

37
00:02:21.046 --> 00:02:25.676
Y'all think I'm finna mess up the rest
of my meniscus for you motherfuckers?


38
00:02:27.052 --> 00:02:29.721
This is maturity. 
That's what this is.

39
00:02:29.805 --> 00:02:31.431
This is fucking maturity.

40
00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:36.228
Let me tell you something.
I'm loving my life right now.


41
00:02:36.311 --> 00:02:37.187
I love it.

42
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.981
I'm always having fun.
I've always been a fun person.


43
00:02:40.065 --> 00:02:43.026
But what I noticed lately,
who haven't been having fun?


44
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.820
The fucking 20-year-olds.

45
00:02:46.154 --> 00:02:48.740
Yeah, 20-year-olds, y'all suck.

46
00:02:50.158 --> 00:02:52.327
Y'all are the worst 20-year-olds...

47
00:02:52.953 --> 00:02:55.997
in the history of our 20-year-olds ever.

48
00:02:57.207 --> 00:03:00.419
Let me tell y'all something.
The nation depends on 20-year-olds.


49
00:03:00.502 --> 00:03:03.171
If we go through some bad stuff,
which we always do.


50
00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:04.965
The nation always goes through it.

51
00:03:05.048 --> 00:03:07.801
If we can still look at the 20-year-olds,
and they're like...


52
00:03:07.884 --> 00:03:09.428
[vocalizing]

53
00:03:10.095 --> 00:03:11.596
[audience laughs]

54
00:03:15.475 --> 00:03:18.770
Then we're like, "Okay, we all right."

55
00:03:19.354 --> 00:03:22.983
But you look at the 20-year-olds now,
and the 20-year-olds now be like...


56
00:03:23.567 --> 00:03:25.235
Ahh!

57
00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:27.904
[audience laughs and cheers]

58
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:32.033
"I am so offended."

59
00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:36.747
You be like, "What are you offended about?

60
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.750
You literally only been
through high school.


61
00:03:40.876 --> 00:03:43.420
What's wrong, boo?
You didn't catch Pikachu?


62
00:03:43.503 --> 00:03:44.755
[hesitates]

63
00:03:46.047 --> 00:03:47.674
Did Pikachu get away from you?"

64
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.304
You better enjoy your damn 20s.

65
00:03:53.346 --> 00:03:54.723
Y'all out here marching.

66
00:03:54.806 --> 00:03:56.808
[laughs hysterically]

67
00:03:56.892 --> 00:03:58.560
That's hilarious!

68
00:03:59.895 --> 00:04:02.856
Ain't nobody listening to a 20-year-old!

69
00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:08.153
I never marched in my 20s.

70
00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:11.114
The only marching I did in my 20s
was to the liquor store.


71
00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:14.993
"Yeah! Bacardi! Uh!

72
00:04:15.076 --> 00:04:18.121
Tequila, tequila, tequila."

73
00:04:20.874 --> 00:04:24.836
Do you think I knew
who the president was...


74
00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.089
in my fucking 20s?

75
00:04:29.257 --> 00:04:30.801
Hell no!

76
00:04:31.551 --> 00:04:34.721
Every 20-year-old's night should end

77
00:04:34.805 --> 00:04:36.223
with glitter and cocaine.

78
00:04:38.225 --> 00:04:39.309
You know what I'm saying?

79
00:04:39.392 --> 00:04:41.937
Not even in that order,
you know what I'm saying?


80
00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.439
'Cause there ain't nothing
like some glitter


81
00:04:44.523 --> 00:04:46.399
after some cocaine!

82
00:04:46.483 --> 00:04:47.567
Whoo!

83
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:48.693
Sparkly!

84
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:55.575
Any 20-year-olds in the house?
Any 20-year-olds?


85

Listless bastards.

87
00:05:00.455 --> 00:05:04.000
Ain't got no freaking energy.

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.434
You're in your 20s?

94
00:05:22.227 --> 00:05:23.603
Oh!

95
00:05:23.687 --> 00:05:25.188
I'm so mad at you right now.

96
00:05:25.981 --> 00:05:28.608
Oh, I'm so fucking mad. 
What time is it?

97
00:05:28.692 --> 00:05:30.777
You're supposed to be naked!

98
00:05:32.362 --> 00:05:34.739
Oh, my God! I didn't even own
one of those sweaters


99
00:05:34.823 --> 00:05:37.033
until I was, like, 37.

100
00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:45.458
I'm so mad at you.

101
00:05:45.542 --> 00:05:47.168
I bet you got drawers on, too.

102
00:05:47.252 --> 00:05:48.587
You got drawers on?

103
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.506
[yells] Why?

104
00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:55.719
What you need drawers on?

105
00:05:55.802 --> 00:05:58.805
Twenty-year-old pussy

I am 52 years old.

109
00:06:16.072 --> 00:06:18.700
My pussy is not containing itself.

110
00:06:18.783 --> 00:06:20.285
[audience laughs and claps]

111
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.623
My pussy is like lava.

Let me explain something.
The 20-year-old men have fun.

Twenty-year-old men have fun in they life.

My funnest night...
One of my funnest nights in my 20s, uh,


128
00:07:13.922 --> 00:07:16.466
I started at work.
Yeah, I was at work, uh,


129
00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:18.259
doing shots in the back.

130
00:07:20.011 --> 00:07:22.639

00:09:26.054 --> 00:09:28.223
You better have fun in your 20s.

164
00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:30.141
[sighs]

165
00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:33.812
'Cause I had fun in my 20s.
Ooh, I was so fine.


166
00:09:35.814 --> 00:09:39.734
[sing-songy] Ooh! Let's have a moment
of silence for that body.


167
00:09:41.194 --> 00:09:43.822
[sing-songy] Ooh, it was so slutty.

168
00:09:46.157 --> 00:09:47.867
'Cause I just stopped playing basketball,

169
00:09:47.951 --> 00:09:51.871
so my breasts, they softened
in the right place. Bam!


170
00:09:51.955 --> 00:09:53.414
Ass, bam!

171
00:09:55.083 --> 00:09:56.459
But I was in my 20s,

172
00:09:56.543 --> 00:09:59.170
so I couldn't control my face or my pussy,
so it was like...


173
00:10:14.352 --> 00:10:15.603
But I was fine.

174
00:10:16.521 --> 00:10:17.772
Ooh, and I was a ho.

175
00:10:18.356 --> 00:10:19.774

Yas!

177
00:10:25.864 --> 00:10:28.116
See how all the women are independent now.

178
00:10:28.199 --> 00:10:31.578
"Yeah, that's right. I was a ho.
I'm a slut. I'm a bitch. I got a t-shirt."


179
00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:37.000
But back in the day,
if you said you was a ho,


180
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:39.586
you had to back that shit up.

181
00:10:39.669 --> 00:10:40.503
[scoffs]

182
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.840
You couldn't be 'bout that life...

183
00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:47.343
if you wasn't 'bout that life.

184
00:10:49.053 --> 00:10:50.638
And I was certified.

185
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:52.807
I used to wear ho dresses.

186
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:54.767
Ya'll remember the ho dresses?

187
00:10:54.851 --> 00:10:56.895
They was like tank tops,
but they was dresses?


188
00:11:00.857 --> 00:11:02.734
On a good night,
if you bend over the right way,


189
00:11:02.817 --> 00:11:04.944
you just might see some of the coochie.

190

[man in audience] Whoo!

191
00:11:13.912 --> 00:11:15.496
Always had weave in my hair.

192
00:11:16.581 --> 00:11:17.999
So either I was just like...

193
00:11:23.171 --> 00:11:24.464
But at the time,

194
00:11:24.547 --> 00:11:27.050
the popular thing was the Sade ponytails.

195
00:11:27.133 --> 00:11:28.134
Y'all remember Sade?

197
00:11:29.344 --> 00:11:32.222
Yeah, go downtown
and get that Indian ponytail.

00:11:34.599 --> 00:11:36.559
Sound racist as hell. I know. Listen...

And I always hung around hos.

203
00:12:05.046 --> 00:12:06.631
'Cause you gotta get shit done.

204
00:12:09.342 --> 00:12:10.218
For real.

205
00:12:10.301 --> 00:12:12.762
If your homegirl ain't willing to suck

206
00:12:12.845 --> 00:12:17.308
Kanye West's dog walker's
father's ex wife's


207
00:12:17.392 --> 00:12:20.728
cousin's niece's father's dick...

208
00:12:21.813 --> 00:12:22.689
fuck her.

209
00:12:25.984 --> 00:12:27.527
That bitch ain't for the team.

210
00:12:29.862 --> 00:12:32.073
And all my friends was hos.
They was for the team.


211
00:12:32.156 --> 00:12:34.409
I had this one homegirl.
Her name was Malaika.


212
00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:37.328
And she would say her name, "Me-like-a."

213
00:12:37.412 --> 00:12:39.038
I'd be like,
"That's not your fucking name."


214
00:12:41.374 --> 00:12:43.835
But she always got us free shit.
You know what I'm saying?


215
00:12:43.918 --> 00:12:46.879
She got us some tickets
to the after-party for the Grammys,


216
00:12:46.963 --> 00:12:48.381
and I was like, "Yeah!"

217
00:12:48.464 --> 00:12:50.800
Now, let me just say this first.

218
00:12:50.883 --> 00:12:53.678
I'm 52,
so there was different stars back then.


219
00:13:02.645 --> 00:13:04.314
LL Cool J was there.

00:13:07.275 --> 00:13:09.027
Yeah, that's when he was a rapper.

00:13:12.113 --> 00:13:13.072
Um...

223
00:13:13.156 --> 00:13:14.532
Tevin Campbell was there.

00:13:28.254 --> 00:13:29.714

But that's the only song
he had out anyway, white people.

00:14:13.383 --> 00:14:14.342
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:18.262 --> 00:14:19.472
And I...

240
00:14:20.056 --> 00:14:23.476
was in my best ho attire.

241
00:14:26.896 --> 00:14:31.109
Yes, I had on my best ho dress,
that was red.


242
00:14:36.864 --> 00:14:42.620
I had my freshly, new-attached ponytail

243
00:14:42.703 --> 00:14:44.664
from that morning.

244
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:59.971
I had on my homegirl's shoes...

245
00:15:00.847 --> 00:15:04.183
that were slightly smaller...

246
00:15:07.728 --> 00:15:08.896
than my feet.

247
00:15:13.568 --> 00:15:15.069
I stood up against the wall a lot.

248
00:15:18.072 --> 00:15:19.949
Then my homegirl Malaika came over.
She was like,


249
00:15:20.032 --> 00:15:22.034
"Yo, Prince is on his way."

250
00:15:22.869 --> 00:15:23.995
[audience cheers]

251
00:15:26.914 --> 00:15:28.624
"Oh, I'm fucking Prince.

252
00:15:30.209 --> 00:15:32.128
I am. I don't give
a fuck how tall he is.

253
00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:36.257
I'm going to stuff his ass
in my fucking garage.


254
00:15:36.841 --> 00:15:40.011
That little red Corvette
is gonna get stuffed."


255
00:15:47.351 --> 00:15:48.978
But as I looked at the VIP section,

256
00:15:49.061 --> 00:15:50.897
I noticed there was
a lot of girls around there,


257
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:52.106
and I was like, "Ooh,

258
00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:54.400
I'm going to have to out-ho these hos."

259
00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:58.446
So I went up against the wall...

260
00:15:59.447 --> 00:16:00.323
to figure out...

261
00:16:01.657 --> 00:16:03.284
how I'm gonna out-ho these hos,

262
00:16:03.868 --> 00:16:05.953
and also to rest my feet some.

263
00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:15.296
While I was resting,

264
00:16:16.255 --> 00:16:17.215
Prince showed up...

265
00:16:17.298 --> 00:16:18.341
[woman in audience] Whoo!

266
00:16:18.424 --> 00:16:19.759
...in Prince fashion.

267
00:16:21.052 --> 00:16:22.136
He had on, um...

268
00:16:26.057 --> 00:16:27.225
[breathing heavily]

269
00:16:30.102 --> 00:16:32.813
...red leather suede chaps
with his ass out.

-[clears throat and exhales]
-[audience laughs]


272
00:16:43.324 --> 00:16:45.952
A yellow half-top, yellow fringe,

273
00:16:46.035 --> 00:16:48.246
Big Bird shirt on...

274
00:16:50.581 --> 00:16:53.042
with a daisy painted
around his belly button...


275
00:16:57.046 --> 00:17:01.217
and a big, old, white fedora
with a big ostrich feather in it...


276
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.636
and six-inch heels.

277
00:17:06.556 --> 00:17:09.308
Now y'all know if a regular person
approached you like that at the club,


278
00:17:09.392 --> 00:17:13.271
you'd be like,
"Get the fuck away from me, you freak!


279
00:17:14.313 --> 00:17:16.774
You got your man
ass out in the club!

280
00:17:17.441 --> 00:17:20.361
That is a man ass!

281
00:17:21.153 --> 00:17:26.951
Do you know how unsanitary it is
to have a man ass...


282
00:17:27.994 --> 00:17:29.495
out in a club?

283
00:17:30.413 --> 00:17:33.499
You just walked across my drink
with your man...


284
00:17:34.667 --> 00:17:36.043
ass!

285
00:17:37.295 --> 00:17:38.421
Security!"

286
00:17:41.882 --> 00:17:43.009
But that was Prince.

287
00:17:44.969 --> 00:17:46.721
And he was beautiful.

288
00:17:46.804 --> 00:17:48.306
[audience cheers and claps]

289
00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:53.978
So I was on the wall.

290
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:56.272
I was thinking,
"How I'mma out-ho these hos?"


291
00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:06.365
Then they played my favorite song.

292
00:18:06.449 --> 00:18:07.700
[audience cheers]

293
00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:09.452
Prince "Gett Off."

294
00:18:09.535 --> 00:18:13.623
I was like, "Oh, okay. All right,
so I know how I'mma out-ho these hos."


295
00:18:14.248 --> 00:18:16.083
Kicked my shoes off. I was like...

296
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.336

00:18:59.168 --> 00:19:00.878

00:20:13.659 --> 00:20:15.661
"Prince!"

306
00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:23.586
That Sade ponytail flew straight off.

307
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:25.045
[audience laughs]

308
00:20:34.263 --> 00:20:35.723
[audience continues laughing]

309
00:20:53.783 --> 00:20:54.950
And I know he saw it...

310
00:20:57.578 --> 00:20:59.371
'cause when I looked over there,
he was like...


311
00:21:08.172 --> 00:21:09.799
That wasn't even the worst part.

312
00:21:11.884 --> 00:21:13.761
Had to go over there to the bodyguard...

313
00:21:18.849 --> 00:21:20.810
look him confidently in the face.

314
00:21:24.271 --> 00:21:25.856
"Can a bitch get that ponytail?

315
00:21:29.109 --> 00:21:31.153
It's over there, somewhere.

316
00:21:32.446 --> 00:21:34.114
You see it, motherfucker."

317
00:21:37.409 --> 00:21:39.745
I wanted to tell Prince that story
when he came to <i>SNL.</i>


318
00:21:39.829 --> 00:21:41.747
I was so excited
about telling him that story,


319
00:21:42.331 --> 00:21:43.874
but I think that
when I was talking to him,


320
00:21:43.958 --> 00:21:45.376
he thought I was Chris Rock.

321
00:21:50.756 --> 00:21:53.634
I was like, "Do you think you're talking
to Chris Rock?" He was like...


322
00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:02.893
Enjoy your 20s, bitch.

323
00:22:07.064 --> 00:22:10.442
'Cause soon you're going to be
in your 30s.


324
00:22:10.943 --> 00:22:12.194
[audience cheering]

325
00:22:15.281 --> 00:22:18.325
Yeah, that's when you're gonna
have to make them real decisions.


326
00:22:19.368 --> 00:22:21.954
You're gonna have to decide
if you going to stay a ho...


327
00:22:25.457 --> 00:22:28.377
or clean yourself up
and become a respectable young lady.


328
00:22:30.629 --> 00:22:32.756
Gotta get your reputation back
in your 30s.


329
00:22:33.757 --> 00:22:35.843
Maybe date a pastor, you know.

330
00:22:37.761 --> 00:22:41.015
Uh, maybe do
some community service, you know,


331
00:22:41.599 --> 00:22:43.601
instead of servicing the community.

332
00:22:50.649 --> 00:22:53.569
[chuckling] That's when you become smart,
in your 30s. You start...


333
00:22:54.194 --> 00:22:55.571
You start realizing that...

334
00:22:56.155 --> 00:22:58.490
there's no such thing
as a Prince Charming. Yeah.


335
00:22:59.116 --> 00:23:02.119
And you are no Sleeping Beauty.

336
00:23:04.705 --> 00:23:08.000
Man, I knew I wasn't no Sleeping Beauty.
I have been told several times,


337
00:23:08.083 --> 00:23:09.960
"You are very unattractive
when you sleep."


338
00:23:13.255 --> 00:23:15.966
I couldn't be Sleeping Beauty anyway.
It'd be different fucking conditions.


339
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:19.219
If I was Sleeping Beauty,
it's gonna be different conditions.


340
00:23:19.303 --> 00:23:21.263
First of all,
the room gonna have to be cold.


341
00:23:23.682 --> 00:23:26.518
Right? 'Cause you see
I'm hotter than a motherfucker already.


342
00:23:26.602 --> 00:23:27.603
I'm hot as fuck.

343
00:23:28.187 --> 00:23:29.647
It's gonna have to be cold in there.

344
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.399
I don't know what the fuck is going on,
but when I lay down,


345
00:23:32.483 --> 00:23:33.776
I get 20 degrees hotter.

346
00:23:33.859 --> 00:23:35.653
I don't know what the fuck is happening.

347
00:23:35.736 --> 00:23:38.155
I don't know if I'm an X
-Man, you know.

348
00:23:41.283 --> 00:23:43.494
Maybe I shoot fireballs out my ass
when I'm asleep.


349
00:23:43.577 --> 00:23:44.870
I don't fucking know.

350
00:23:44.954 --> 00:23:47.039
But it's hot, okay? 
It's fucking hot.

351
00:23:47.623 --> 00:23:48.666
All right?

352
00:23:48.749 --> 00:23:53.796
So if the prince come in my room,
it's going to be a nice, balmy 45 degrees.


353
00:24:00.386 --> 00:24:03.514
It's just going to be different conditions
if I am Sleeping Beauty.


354
00:24:03.597 --> 00:24:08.102
Like, um, I also sleep
with a very fashionable apnea mask.


355
00:24:14.066 --> 00:24:17.236
'Cause I don't know
when the Lord really coming, so, like...


356
00:24:19.279 --> 00:24:22.032
I'm 52,
and the oxygen should just be right there.


357
00:24:22.116 --> 00:24:24.284
Should just be right there.

358
00:24:26.954 --> 00:24:29.707
Then I also, uh, wear earplugs,

359
00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:33.210
'cause the shit kids upstairs
don't give a fuck about my life!


360
00:24:39.591 --> 00:24:42.803
I also wear a wrap cap because
that's just how black women sleep.


361
00:24:42.886 --> 00:24:44.638
-[grunts]
-[women in audience cheer]


362
00:24:47.349 --> 00:24:50.686
And I have seven blankets
'cause it's fucking 45 degrees.


363
00:24:55.566 --> 00:24:57.317
So if the prince come in my room,
he'll be like...


364
00:24:57.401 --> 00:24:59.403
"Oh, shit,

365
00:24:59.987 --> 00:25:02.281
it's colder than a motherfucker in here!

366
00:25:03.157 --> 00:25:04.366
Fuck!"

367
00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:06.285
He start pulling them blankets back.

368
00:25:07.661 --> 00:25:09.705
He going to be like, "Oh, shit!

369
00:25:10.956 --> 00:25:13.125
This is not Sleeping Beauty.

370
00:25:14.626 --> 00:25:16.170
Uh, this is Shrek.

371
00:25:19.673 --> 00:25:22.301
I'mma kiss this bitch anyway. It is cold."

372
00:25:23.844 --> 00:25:25.471
[audience cheering and clapping]

373
00:25:29.475 --> 00:25:31.894
It's hard in your
30s, even for the men.

374
00:25:31.977 --> 00:25:34.313
I mean, 30-year-old men
got decisions to make, too,


375
00:25:34.396 --> 00:25:36.523
like who they're gonna bring home to mama.

376
00:25:36.607 --> 00:25:38.609
You know, "Am I
gonna bring the ho home...

377
00:25:39.985 --> 00:25:41.737
or the reformed one, like a...

378
00:25:43.197 --> 00:25:44.698
[chuckling] Like a dental hygienist?"

379
00:25:52.206 --> 00:25:53.415
Y'all know they hos.

380
00:25:55.667 --> 00:25:56.960
You can see it in their eyes.

381
00:25:57.044 --> 00:25:59.046
You're like, "You used
to be a ho, huh?"

382
00:26:00.964 --> 00:26:02.007
[laughs]

383
00:26:02.508 --> 00:26:04.676
All my homegirls is dental hygienists.

384
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.803
Whoo!

385
00:26:05.886 --> 00:26:09.723
If them people knew where they put
their fingers before that job...


386
00:26:10.224 --> 00:26:11.100
Whoo!

387
00:26:17.189 --> 00:26:18.273
Oh, shit.

388
00:26:19.399 --> 00:26:20.984
Let me sum up your 30s for you.

389
00:26:22.486 --> 00:26:26.406
Your 30s, you start off
as a beautiful, bright yellow banana.


390
00:26:28.867 --> 00:26:31.036
As you age through your 30s,

391
00:26:31.787 --> 00:26:33.705
you start getting them brown spots.

392
00:26:35.582 --> 00:26:38.418
Till you're 39, you a black-ass banana.

393
00:26:40.546 --> 00:26:44.550
Only thing to do with you
is to throw you out or make banana bread.


394
00:26:50.848 --> 00:26:52.182
Enjoy your 20s, bitch.

395
00:26:59.356 --> 00:27:01.567
Or marry a baker. [chuckles]

396
00:27:07.322 --> 00:27:08.282
Whoo!

397
00:27:08.365 --> 00:27:10.409
'Cause then you're gonna be in your 40s.

398
00:27:10.492 --> 00:27:11.493
[audience cheering]

399
00:27:14.371 --> 00:27:16.373
Denial!

400
00:27:18.917 --> 00:27:20.711
You are in such denial in your 40s,

401
00:27:20.794 --> 00:27:23.881
'cause you still think you can do
the same things that you did


402
00:27:24.381 --> 00:27:25.674
when you was in your 20s.

403
00:27:26.717 --> 00:27:29.678
"Yeah, girl, I can still do that.
Let me go get my knee brace."


404
00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:30.596
Nope.

405
00:27:32.681 --> 00:27:35.726
"Nope, not the same thing, Auntie.
Come on, come on.


406
00:27:35.809 --> 00:27:37.686
It's not the same thing. Come on."

407
00:27:39.354 --> 00:27:41.690
I was in such denial in my 40s.

408
00:27:41.773 --> 00:27:42.900
Oh, my God. [scoffs]

409
00:27:42.983 --> 00:27:45.736
My 42nd birthday,
I had a theme birthday party.


410
00:27:45.819 --> 00:27:47.738
I was like, "42...

411
00:27:50.449 --> 00:27:51.533
the new...

412
00:27:52.951 --> 00:27:54.119
22."

413
00:28:00.667 --> 00:28:01.501
Nope.

414
00:28:04.421 --> 00:28:07.507
We all know that 22 and 42
are two different women.


415
00:28:08.884 --> 00:28:12.971
Yeah, 22 got fresh pussy.
Fresh! Just fresh.


416
00:28:13.055 --> 00:28:14.848
They fresh like new snow.

417
00:28:15.349 --> 00:28:17.476
You know how you step on snow,
and it be like... [mimics snow crunching]


418
00:28:17.559 --> 00:28:18.810
You know what I'm saying? Just like...

419
00:28:18.894 --> 00:28:21.438
Ooh! [mimicking snow crunching]

420
00:28:46.964 --> 00:28:48.840
That's 22-year-old pussy right there.

421
00:28:52.261 --> 00:28:53.804
42-year-old pussy be like...

422
00:28:53.887 --> 00:28:54.888
[blowing raspberry]

423
00:29:20.956 --> 00:29:21.832
[coughs]

424
00:29:32.426 --> 00:29:34.928
22, 42, two different women.

425
00:29:35.679 --> 00:29:37.764
22-year-olds can fuck all night,
and they tell you.


426
00:29:37.848 --> 00:29:39.975
When you get to the door, they be like,
"We gonna fuck all night."


427
00:29:40.058 --> 00:29:41.059
You be like, "Why?"

428
00:29:50.986 --> 00:29:52.988
"Because I can. Come on. 
Let's stretch."

429
00:29:58.952 --> 00:30:02.414
Not no 42-year-old.
You got exactly 45 minutes.


430
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.918
[voice shakes] And that includes
us walking upstairs.


431
00:30:16.386 --> 00:30:18.930
Me taking off my jewelry
and checking my DVR.


432
00:30:24.853 --> 00:30:26.772
We both have a light snack.

433
00:30:32.778 --> 00:30:33.987
We take separate showers

434
00:30:34.071 --> 00:30:36.198
[sobs] 'cause I might
have to pee in the shower.


435
00:30:43.955 --> 00:30:47.125
I got to call all my homegirls
and tell her you not a predator.


436
00:30:49.378 --> 00:30:51.046
And then I got to say my prayers.

437
00:30:52.381 --> 00:30:53.715
You got seven minutes.

438
00:30:57.302 --> 00:31:00.222
22-year-old prayers,

439
00:31:01.264 --> 00:31:02.933
22-year-old prayers be like...

440
00:31:05.936 --> 00:31:06.812
"Lord...

441
00:31:08.939 --> 00:31:12.067
please don't let me catch
any venereal diseases.


442
00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:19.825
Thank God for this sweater."

443
00:31:33.672 --> 00:31:35.465
42-year-old prayers be like...

444
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:38.135
"Lord...

445
00:31:39.553 --> 00:31:41.054
why am I so tired?

446
00:31:45.559 --> 00:31:48.103
I'm taking the vitamins like you said,
Jesus.


447
00:31:55.777 --> 00:31:56.653
Lord...

448
00:31:58.029 --> 00:32:02.117
please don't let him catch
any of my venereal diseases.


449
00:32:08.081 --> 00:32:11.835
And, Lord, please don't let me
have to shit right after, Father.


450
00:32:11.918 --> 00:32:12.794
It is just...

451
00:32:13.295 --> 00:32:14.963
It's not sexy, Lord!"

452
00:32:17.841 --> 00:32:19.718
Your body break the fuck down

453
00:32:19.801 --> 00:32:22.888
after you're fucking in your 40s.
Your body break down.


454
00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.849
You try to have sex after 46?

455
00:32:25.932 --> 00:32:30.353
"Put my leg down! 
Put my leg down!

456
00:32:35.942 --> 00:32:38.570
I got osteoporosis."

457
00:32:45.368 --> 00:32:47.329
And no, you can't spend the night. No.

458
00:32:48.413 --> 00:32:50.624
I have seven blankets on my bed.

459
00:32:50.707 --> 00:32:52.626
It's too fucking hot.

460
00:32:54.461 --> 00:32:55.921
And now I gotta shit.

461
00:33:02.761 --> 00:33:03.637
When I shit,

462
00:33:04.179 --> 00:33:05.722
I have to have the door open.

463
00:33:08.099 --> 00:33:10.101
'Cause it's so fucking hot.

464
00:33:15.482 --> 00:33:17.442
And I need to be
able to see the clock.

465
00:33:20.654 --> 00:33:23.323
I can't sit too long,
or I get thrombosis. [chuckles]


466
00:33:28.495 --> 00:33:31.081
Bitch, do you know what thrombosis is?

467
00:33:37.087 --> 00:33:40.298
You ain't going to know none of that shit
until you get my fucking age.


468
00:33:40.382 --> 00:33:43.093
You gonna learn all the medical terms.

469
00:33:43.176 --> 00:33:47.305
Thrombosis, osteoporosis...

470
00:33:47.973 --> 00:33:50.433
Shit's so hard to say,
I gotta say it in Spanish.


471
00:33:52.143 --> 00:33:55.564
Cartilage, meniscus, aorta...

472
00:33:57.065 --> 00:33:59.109
When I was in my 20s, 
I thought aorta was,

473
00:33:59.192 --> 00:34:02.028
"Hey! Order me another drink."

474

486
00:34:49.868 --> 00:34:51.661
My accountant called me, and she was like,

487
00:34:51.745 --> 00:34:54.247
"Yo, man, you got
to make a living trust."

488
00:34:54.331 --> 00:34:56.082
And I was like, "A living trust?

What the fuck is a living trust?

490

How about that?"

492
00:35:02.964 --> 00:35:05.800
I had planned on taking
all that shit with me, like...


493
00:35:06.384 --> 00:35:09.596
Back the motherfucking bulldozer
up to the grave, bitch,


494
00:35:09.679 --> 00:35:12.974
and dump all that shit in there
on top of my fucking coffin.

497

But he was like, "You can't do that,"

498
00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:22.400
and I was like,
"Oh, the Egyptians did it."

He was like, "You can't do that."

And put it in the Hudson River.

And I'll be in the Hudson like...

That's his gigolo name from now on.

Y'all know I don't know how...
This ain't how you smoke crack.

that stank-breath coffee, too, just...

And I'm gonna smoke a cigar, too.
Just stank, just...


526
00:37:40.872 --> 00:37:43.374
I don't think
that's how you smoke a cigar, either.

"You got to move the catheter
to the side, Dwayne.


535

536

In Crocs? You gonna wear Crocs

Man, a booty call
turned into a police call.

Can't fucking fight me in Crocs.

596
00:44:23.482 --> 00:44:26.319
You can't do shit in Crocs
but be a nurse or a cook.


597
00:44:30.156 --> 00:44:33.409
His dogs was like, "Holy shit."

598
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:37.371
They did not jump in.

Who invented texting?

605
00:45:03.689 --> 00:45:05.816
It wasn't a woman, no. 
Let me tell you.

606
00:45:06.651 --> 00:45:10.821
'Cause texting shows exactly
how crazy a bitch really is.


607
00:45:14.575 --> 00:45:16.494
Yeah, ladies, listen right now.

608
00:45:17.161 --> 00:45:20.248
You always wonder why your man
calling you a crazy-ass bitch?


609
00:45:21.165 --> 00:45:23.876
Go back and read some of your texts.

610
00:45:28.631 --> 00:45:31.050
You will see that you are a psycho.

611
00:45:35.179 --> 00:45:37.265
You know we don't
appropriately use that shit.


612
00:45:37.348 --> 00:45:39.892
We pick the phone up in a minute,
be like, "Fuck you.

Fuck you. Fuck you.

You need to respect me.

You need to R

'Cause I keep it 100."

617
00:45:53.656 --> 00:45:55.700
Then we do that emoji, that 100 emoji.

618
00:45:56.242 --> 00:45:58.077
"100, 100, 100."

we're emotional.

622
00:46:11.882 --> 00:46:15.011
An hour later, we're like,
"I am so sorry about that text.


623
00:46:17.722 --> 00:46:19.473
It was unnecessary...

624

But that's why I love you, bae.

'Cause it ain't like it used to be
in the good old days.


630
00:46:42.496 --> 00:46:44.582
You remember the good old days,
the answering machine?


631
00:46:45.249 --> 00:46:48.836

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:05.770
Call back, figure out the code,
erase the message.


636
00:47:12.985 --> 00:47:15.946
Do that shit six, seven times,

Not texting. That shit is instant.

You can't pull it back. You can't do shit.


639
00:47:25.331 --> 00:47:27.458
What we need is an app. 
We need an app,

640
00:47:28.042 --> 00:47:30.378
so when we're talking shit like that,

Mmm. All right. Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

644
00:47:38.386 --> 00:47:40.388
You sure you want
to send that shit out?

645
00:47:45.101 --> 00:47:46.435
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

646
00:47:48.187 --> 00:47:51.732
You are at... 85% crazy right now.

We gonna send you a picture of your face
and what it look like right now.


649
00:47:59.657 --> 00:48:01.826
And while you texting
the one that you love,


650
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:04.453
your face's not supposed
to look like that."


651

We got titties.

Men, they just want to suck them.

We carry a human around in our body
like a fucking backpack!


703
00:52:11.492 --> 00:52:12.868
Then we proceed...

[voice breaking] to push it out
the smallest hole...

Boom!

We should be able to walk around like this
for six months.


708
00:52:32.721 --> 00:52:34.973
Somebody asks, we be like,

The strongest, meanest,

he'll be like, "What!"


726
00:53:58.849 --> 00:54:02.019
You pull a dick out on a girl,
she'll be like, "Oh, that's all you got?"

Your nuts smell like lunch meat.

00:58:00.507 --> 00:58:03.343
I have to say
that this is fucking awesome.


789
00:58:03.427 --> 00:58:04.469
[audience cheering]

790
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:13.979
So overwhelmed.
It's so crazy where my life is right now,


791
00:58:14.062 --> 00:58:15.605
and it's just fucking great.

792
00:58:15.689 --> 00:58:18.066
Like, the hard work does pay off.
It's fucking great,


793
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:19.484
but I'mma tell you, in my 20s...

794
00:58:19.568 --> 00:58:21.862
I was so troubled in my 20s.
I was like, "Fuck, man."


795
00:58:21.945 --> 00:58:23.697
You know, I was having fun,
partying and shit,


796
00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.867
but I was scared for my future.
I didn't know what I was gonna do.


797
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:28.827
I knew I was funny,
but I didn't know what to do,


798
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:31.747
sitting at the same bus stop every day,
going to the same shitty job,


799
00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:34.499
and terrible shoes, just fucked up life.

800
00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:38.378
You know,
it's bad when you have bad shoes. [sniffs]


801
00:58:39.463 --> 00:58:42.090
And I look at
myself now, and I go,

802
00:58:42.174 --> 00:58:46.762
I wish I had a time machine, like,
to go back and tell the 20-year-old self,


803
00:58:46.845 --> 00:58:47.846
"Hey, it's gonna be okay,"

804
00:58:47.929 --> 00:58:49.723
and when I see it,
it's such a beautiful story.


805
00:58:49.806 --> 00:58:52.601
So, like, watch. Okay.
So, I'm in the time machine...


806
00:58:55.353 --> 00:58:57.481
and I land in Compton, right?

807
00:58:58.106 --> 00:59:00.233
Okay, so the 51-year-old me
get out the time machine,


808
00:59:00.317 --> 00:59:03.111
and you know, I'm the 51-year-old me,
you know, bomb-ass mohawk,


809
00:59:03.195 --> 00:59:04.780
dope-ass shirt or jacket,

810
00:59:04.863 --> 00:59:06.948
dope shoes, like...

811
00:59:07.866 --> 00:59:10.911
I... do. Yeah.

812
00:59:11.453 --> 00:59:13.246
So I step to the 21-year-old Leslie.

813
00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:15.207
I'd be like, "Hey, 21-year-old Leslie.

814
00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:16.917
Hey, how you doing?
I'm 51-year-old Leslie,


815
00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.336
and I'm here to tell you,
everything's going to be okay.


816
00:59:19.419 --> 00:59:21.421
Know what I'm saying?
Just here to give you guidance.


817
00:59:21.505 --> 00:59:23.924
First of all,
you need to break up with Richard.


818
00:59:28.428 --> 00:59:29.304
Second...

819
00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.599
Um, I wish you would get better shoes...

820
00:59:34.518 --> 00:59:37.145
because, like,
you're fucking your feet up right now.


821
00:59:37.938 --> 00:59:40.190
At 43, I have to have a surgery,

822
00:59:40.273 --> 00:59:43.318
and they don't even know
what to call what it is on my foot.


823
00:59:44.486 --> 00:59:47.322
They just say, 'We gonna go in there
and take the foot thing off.'


824
00:59:49.324 --> 00:59:51.660
So, can you try to get
some better fucking shoes?


825
00:59:52.452 --> 00:59:56.540
Hey, and how about you eat a vegetable
once in a while, you fucking cunt?


826
00:59:56.623 --> 00:59:57.833
What the fuck?

827
00:59:58.542 --> 01:00:01.253
You eat so fucking awful, man.

828
01:00:01.336 --> 01:00:04.631
You eat chili cheese fries, like,
every fucking day.


829
01:00:04.714 --> 01:00:06.383
Because of you right now,

830
01:00:06.466 --> 01:00:10.303
I can't eat chili, cheese, or fries.

831
01:00:13.181 --> 01:00:14.933
Can you get a fucking better diet?

832
01:00:15.016 --> 01:00:17.227
Damn, what'd I come here for?
Uh, okay, okay.


833
01:00:18.353 --> 01:00:21.106
The comedy. You're dead-on.
You're funny as fuck.


834
01:00:21.189 --> 01:00:23.108
I'm telling you,
you just go fucking to the club,


835
01:00:23.191 --> 01:00:25.735
work your ass off. 
It's going to happen.

836
01:00:25.819 --> 01:00:28.530
You're gonna become Leslie Jones.
Just do it, just fucking do it." Right?


837
01:00:28.613 --> 01:00:30.949
It's inspirational. So, you know... Wait.

838
01:00:31.032 --> 01:00:33.118
Before I get back in the time machine,
I come back and go,


839
01:00:33.201 --> 01:00:34.035
"Hey, one more thing.

840
01:00:34.119 --> 01:00:35.287
Hey, tell Aaliyah,

841
01:00:35.370 --> 01:00:37.414
do not fuck R. Kelly.

842
01:00:38.707 --> 01:00:39.749
Do something!

843
01:00:40.292 --> 01:00:42.919
Do something while you can!
Don't stand there!


844
01:00:43.003 --> 01:00:44.296
Do something!"

845
01:00:46.548 --> 01:00:48.884
Then I get in the time machine,
fly off, right?


846
01:00:48.967 --> 01:00:49.885
But alas...

847
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:54.931
I love saying that.
White people always get that.


848
01:00:57.767 --> 01:00:58.852
But alas...

849
01:01:00.687 --> 01:01:06.151
I do know that the 21-year-old Leslie
would not be as receptive. [chuckles]


850
01:01:07.777 --> 01:01:10.113
So that story would go
completely different.


851
01:01:10.197 --> 01:01:11.573
So I'm in the time machine.

852
01:01:12.782 --> 01:01:14.618
I land the time machine in Compton.

853
01:01:14.701 --> 01:01:16.119
I hide the time machine.

854
01:01:18.872 --> 01:01:20.415
'Cause we in fucking Compton.

855
01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:26.630
The 21-year-old Leslie is a fucking thug.

856
01:01:27.714 --> 01:01:30.550
Seriously. Hood rat, will fight you.

857
01:01:30.634 --> 01:01:32.552
You not about to
just walk up on her

858
01:01:32.636 --> 01:01:34.930
without her jumping
and maybe hitting you first.


859
01:01:35.013 --> 01:01:36.681
You just not going
to run up on her.

860
01:01:36.765 --> 01:01:40.268
If the 51-year-old Leslie approached me,
I'd be like, "But what the...


861
01:01:41.061 --> 01:01:43.021
Okay, well, who is you, though?

862
01:01:44.272 --> 01:01:45.482
But who is you, though?

863
01:01:46.066 --> 01:01:47.234
But who is you, though?

864
01:01:47.859 --> 01:01:49.986
But who is you, though?
No, I don't recognize you.


865
01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:51.613
Who is you? Who is you, though?

866
01:01:51.696 --> 01:01:53.448
But who is you, though? You me?

867
01:01:54.032 --> 01:01:55.116
You me?

868
01:01:55.659 --> 01:01:56.618
You me?

869
01:01:57.244 --> 01:01:58.370
You me?

870
01:01:58.870 --> 01:02:01.039
Well, what the fuck wrong with your hair?
What's that?


871
01:02:02.749 --> 01:02:04.960
That's a mohawk?
Bitch, you look like a bird.


872
01:02:07.128 --> 01:02:09.297
Change that shit for real.

873
01:02:09.881 --> 01:02:12.008
And don't be talking about Richard!
I love Richard.


874
01:02:12.092 --> 01:02:14.261
That's my man. 
I'mma have a baby with him!

875
01:02:17.722 --> 01:02:18.848
Who's R. Kelly?

876
01:02:21.518 --> 01:02:23.395
It's all about Michael Jackson, baby.

877
01:02:24.479 --> 01:02:25.522
He fucked up, too?

878
01:02:31.444 --> 01:02:33.280
Well, what kind of shoes are those?

879
01:02:33.363 --> 01:02:36.157
Oh, those are Louis Vuitton shoes...
Tennis shoes?


880
01:02:36.241 --> 01:02:37.784
Louis Vuitton? Really?

881
01:02:42.455 --> 01:02:43.415
Them is nice.

882
01:02:43.498 --> 01:02:46.167
What size are those?
They the same size as my foot.


883
01:02:47.377 --> 01:02:48.795
That is real cool.

884
01:02:50.213 --> 01:02:53.216
You gonna have to come
the fuck up off of them shoes, bitch."


885
01:02:55.051 --> 01:02:57.512
Now I'm running to the time machine
from myself!


886
01:03:02.851 --> 01:03:05.603
I get back to the fucking present,
and I'm still scared.


887
01:03:07.188 --> 01:03:08.773
What's gonna happen to me in the future?

888
01:03:08.857 --> 01:03:10.942
I mean, like what the fuck,
am I okay in the future?


889
01:03:11.026 --> 01:03:13.695
So now I'm like, okay, now I wanna
take the time machine to the future


890
01:03:13.778 --> 01:03:15.572
and see the 91-year-old Leslie.

891
01:03:15.655 --> 01:03:16.573
[audience murmurs]

892
01:03:16.656 --> 01:03:19.993
Exactly. I want to see if I'm okay.
So I get in, you know, the time machine,


893
01:03:20.076 --> 01:03:23.496
and when I land,
it's like real dusty and red. [exhales]


894
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.539
Real dusty.

895
01:03:24.622 --> 01:03:26.541
And as soon as the door open,

896
01:03:26.624 --> 01:03:28.460
the 91-year-old Leslie sitting there...

897
01:03:29.044 --> 01:03:30.128
with a laser gun.

898
01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:34.132
"I was expecting you.

899
01:03:37.344 --> 01:03:42.724
Get your fucking ass back to your 50s
and have a good life, man.


900
01:03:42.807 --> 01:03:44.392
[audience cheers]

901
01:03:44.476 --> 01:03:46.853
Enjoy your fucking self, dude.

902
01:03:47.437 --> 01:03:49.731
You're doing great.
People like you. You're funny.


903
01:03:49.814 --> 01:03:53.693
You're making money. What are you doing?
Enjoy yourself.


904
01:03:53.777 --> 01:03:55.195
Get back there."

905
01:03:55.278 --> 01:03:56.112
[mimicking laser gunshots]

906
01:04:01.451 --> 01:04:04.496
"All right, I'm going, but before I go,
can I ask a question?


907
01:04:04.579 --> 01:04:06.331
What is this? Where are you?"

908
01:04:06.414 --> 01:04:07.499
"Mars.

909
01:04:07.582 --> 01:04:09.667
Do not fuck Elon Musk."

[mimicking laser gunshots]

911
01:04:24.682 --> 01:04:25.809
So, what's the lesson?

912
01:04:30.730 --> 01:04:32.357
You can't fix the past.

913
01:04:33.024 --> 01:04:34.234
You can't see the future.

914
01:04:34.859 --> 01:04:38.363
Might as well live in the present
and have some faith.
