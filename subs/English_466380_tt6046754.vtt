15

a cake stall, Gwyn.

Somebody's got to be
at the end of the line, Bob.


326
00:18:10.127 --> 00:18:13.963
It's the nature of a line that
there's somebody on the end of it.

I'm just waving it around.
Makes me look silly.

00:26:58.888 --> 00:27:02.357
paradiddle, quarter notes,
rolls, shuffles, triplets,


472
00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:04.426
quads, backbeat, drags,

473
00:27:04.428 --> 00:27:06.730
descendos, bembè,
and bossa nova,


474
00:27:07.865 --> 00:27:10.132
I'd say it was just banging.

475
00:27:10.134 --> 00:27:11.999
And it's fun!

476
00:27:12.001 --> 00:27:13.101
For you, maybe.

477
00:27:13.103 --> 00:27:14.172
Not for us.

478
00:27:17.875 --> 00:27:19.477
Oh, God.

479
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.044
Ukuleles.

480
00:27:22.046 --> 00:27:23.711
You don't like ukuleles?

481
00:27:23.713 --> 00:27:25.280
I love ukuleles.

482
00:27:25.282 --> 00:27:27.615
It's the people playing them
that I can't stand.


483
00:27:27.617 --> 00:27:29.084
What?

484
00:27:29.086 --> 00:27:31.118
The ukulele isn't
an instrument anymore.


485
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.855
It's a lifestyle.

486
00:27:32.857 --> 00:27:36.057
It's a low-tech dating app
for middle-aged divorcees.


487
00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:39.862
How can you be so judgmental of
other people's musical choices?


488
00:27:39.864 --> 00:27:41.128
Well, music is my life.

489
00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:42.431
Your living?

490
00:27:42.433 --> 00:27:44.865
No, living is a small
dog washing business


491
00:27:44.867 --> 00:27:46.701
but if it helps,

492
00:27:46.703 --> 00:27:48.403
I was the youngest ever member
of the Irish Youth Orchestra.


493
00:27:48.405 --> 00:27:50.372
On the theremin?

494
00:27:50.374 --> 00:27:51.874
I played a few other things.

495
00:27:51.876 --> 00:27:53.709
Like?

496
00:27:53.711 --> 00:27:58.016
Mandolin, harpsichord, guitar,
double bass, piccolo, and bassoon.


497
00:27:59.215 --> 00:28:00.615
And you chose the theremin?

498
00:28:00.617 --> 00:28:01.851
Eventually.

499
00:28:01.853 --> 00:28:03.352
I just wasn't good enough
at the others.


500
00:28:03.354 --> 00:28:05.220
I came to accept that
I'm not a true artist,


501
00:28:05.222 --> 00:28:08.057
just a gifted technician.

502
00:28:08.059 --> 00:28:11.393
So I challenged myself to the
world's most technical instrument.


503
00:28:11.395 --> 00:28:13.628
Sounds to me like you
just choose an instrument


504
00:28:13.630 --> 00:28:15.230
that so few people play

505
00:28:15.232 --> 00:28:17.199
you could have a good shot
at being the best at it.


506
00:28:17.201 --> 00:28:18.933
No, I've given up
trying to be best,


507
00:28:18.935 --> 00:28:21.572
but I know it when I see it.
And I see it in you.


508
00:28:23.874 --> 00:28:25.941
Who's the handsome fella
Keevey's with?


509
00:28:25.943 --> 00:28:27.809
Do you know him?

510
00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:30.645
No, she loves 'em and leaves
'em, just like her Dad.


511
00:28:30.647 --> 00:28:32.847
I suppose she saw what a
big mistake her Mum made


512
00:28:32.849 --> 00:28:34.082
settling for an asshole
like you


513
00:28:34.084 --> 00:28:35.951
and she doesn't want
to repeat it.


514
00:28:35.953 --> 00:28:37.452
That may be it.

515
00:28:37.454 --> 00:28:39.086
The women in my family
always had the brains.


516
00:28:39.088 --> 00:28:40.422
Oh Jesus, Eamon,

517
00:28:40.424 --> 00:28:42.557
can't you even drink
your coffee straight?


518
00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:45.395
I could, my darling,
but I do not choose to.


519
00:28:47.764 --> 00:28:49.198
Where did you train?

520
00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.566
Didn't. Music's just
in the family.


521
00:28:50.568 --> 00:28:51.633
Your parents play?

522
00:28:51.635 --> 00:28:53.101
Dad does. Mum did.

523
00:28:53.103 --> 00:28:54.903
Sorry,

524
00:28:54.905 --> 00:28:56.238
don't buy that.

525
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.705
Music isn't something
you choose.


526
00:28:57.707 --> 00:29:00.174
If you can just drop it,
you never had it.


527
00:29:00.176 --> 00:29:01.145
She died.

528
00:29:01.611 --> 00:29:03.245
Ah.

529
00:29:03.247 --> 00:29:04.579
That old excuse.

530
00:29:04.581 --> 00:29:06.818
Car crash. Hit a tree.
I was sixteen.


531
00:29:07.818 --> 00:29:08.916
Well,

532
00:29:08.918 --> 00:29:10.719
if there is a heaven,

533
00:29:10.721 --> 00:29:12.488
which I'm afraid
there definitely isn't,


534
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.159
I imagine she's pretty proud.

535
00:29:15.693 --> 00:29:18.093
I don't think she'd
really care that much.


536
00:29:18.095 --> 00:29:19.230
She dumped me anyway.

537
00:29:20.196 --> 00:29:21.663
- Dumped you?
- Left.


538
00:29:21.665 --> 00:29:23.332
Dad came home pissed
one too many times


539
00:29:23.334 --> 00:29:24.335
and she shot through.

540
00:29:26.002 --> 00:29:28.839
So in fact she dumped him.

541
00:29:29.572 --> 00:29:31.472
Put it this way.

542
00:29:31.474 --> 00:29:33.177
I wasn't enough
to make her stay.


543
00:29:34.611 --> 00:29:35.711
Rolly, mate!

544
00:29:35.713 --> 00:29:37.345
Hey, Jack!

545
00:29:37.347 --> 00:29:39.682
Didn't expect to
see you at Westival.


546
00:29:39.684 --> 00:29:41.349
Too many actual tunes for
you, I'd have thought.


547
00:29:41.351 --> 00:29:43.018
(LAUGHING)

548
00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.622
This bloke plays the dumbest
instrument in Australia


549
00:29:46.624 --> 00:29:48.757
and that's coming from a fella
who plays a hollow stick.


550
00:29:48.759 --> 00:29:50.159
(LAUGHING)

551
00:29:50.161 --> 00:29:51.759
This is Jessie.

552
00:29:51.761 --> 00:29:53.261
He plays a bit of guitar.

553
00:29:53.263 --> 00:29:55.163
I told him you might
show him a few shapes.


554
00:29:55.165 --> 00:29:56.664
Not interested.

555
00:29:56.666 --> 00:29:58.136
If I dock his money
he'll be interested.


556
00:29:59.369 --> 00:30:01.237
Roland's an amazing fella.

557
00:30:01.239 --> 00:30:02.738
Any talent a kid's got,

558
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.639
he'll find it and
work with it.


559
00:30:04.641 --> 00:30:08.343
Jack does a midnight jam for kids
in Freo who are out on the streets.


560
00:30:08.345 --> 00:30:09.778
That's very cool.

561
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.146
So, how about it?
Will you give him a go?


562
00:30:12.148 --> 00:30:13.883
Well sorry Jack,

563
00:30:13.885 --> 00:30:16.484
I'd like to help, but you can't
teach a reluctant student.


564
00:30:16.486 --> 00:30:17.688
They have to want to learn.

565
00:30:19.089 --> 00:30:20.157
Come on, you two.

566
00:30:20.624 --> 00:30:21.626
Bye.

567
00:30:26.129 --> 00:30:28.364
You know, I like that song
you were playing.


568
00:30:28.366 --> 00:30:30.165
Impressions of Nirvana?

569
00:30:30.167 --> 00:30:33.301
I kinda liked the
not remotely like Nirvana.


570
00:30:33.303 --> 00:30:34.804
But no, it was
the other one.


571
00:30:34.806 --> 00:30:36.505
The... You were playing it
in your workshop.


572
00:30:36.507 --> 00:30:38.207
It was... It was pretty.

573
00:30:38.209 --> 00:30:39.907
It was like a siren voice.

574
00:30:39.909 --> 00:30:42.044
Oh, just the freeform.

575
00:30:42.046 --> 00:30:43.377
Extemporizing.

576
00:30:43.379 --> 00:30:46.184
Yeah, that was sculpted
and then forgotten.


577
00:30:47.651 --> 00:30:48.853
Not by me.

578
00:30:50.654 --> 00:30:53.090
(FIDDLE PLAYING)

579
00:31:16.914 --> 00:31:19.347
That's incredible.

580
00:31:19.349 --> 00:31:21.549
I can't believe
you remembered it.


581
00:31:21.551 --> 00:31:23.885
Yeah, well I liked it.
It drew me in.


582
00:31:23.887 --> 00:31:25.423
It's why I call it
<i>Siren Voice.</i>


583
00:31:28.192 --> 00:31:30.791
<i>Well, that's all from me
for another day</i>


584
00:31:30.793 --> 00:31:33.394
<i>and uh, I'll be
at the WArrikins gig later.</i>


585
00:31:33.396 --> 00:31:36.364
<i>And for my younger listeners,
a band called</i> Feminasty


586

right here in the chapel,</i>


587
00:31:38.368 --> 00:31:42.104
<i>and they tell me they intend
to really kick some bottom.</i>


588
00:31:42.106 --> 00:31:43.971
<i>So uh, that sounds like fun.</i>

all a folking good night.</i>

<i>It's a joke.
Please don't write in.</i>


591
00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.616
Nice digs.

592
00:31:52.215 --> 00:31:53.515
You think?

593
00:31:53.517 --> 00:31:55.584
Well I'm sleeping
in my microvan.


594
00:31:55.586 --> 00:31:57.118
It's a bit of a squeeze.

595
00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.922
Room enough for one,
if you sleep at an angle.


596
00:31:59.924 --> 00:32:02.057
No Mrs, Theremin, then?

597
00:32:02.059 --> 00:32:06.129
No genius techy girl geek
blowing your fuse?


598
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.866
Being a musician is
not great for relationships.


599
00:32:11.868 --> 00:32:13.634
Oh, tell me about it.

600
00:32:13.636 --> 00:32:15.770
I'm never anywhere for more
than a couple of days.


601
00:32:15.772 --> 00:32:17.806
I've been trying Tinder,
but really,


602
00:32:17.808 --> 00:32:19.407
to be honest,
I'm kind of over it.


603
00:32:19.409 --> 00:32:20.474
- Tinder?
- Mmm-hmm.


604
00:32:20.476 --> 00:32:21.745
Wow. Really?

605
00:32:22.379 --> 00:32:23.979
Yeah.

606
00:32:23.981 --> 00:32:25.580
People always think it's
weird when girls are on it


607
00:32:25.582 --> 00:32:27.650
but plenty are, otherwise
it wouldn't work, would it?


608
00:32:27.652 --> 00:32:29.053
And it would be Grindr.

609
00:32:34.125 --> 00:32:36.327
It does get lonely
on the road sometimes.


610
00:32:39.129 --> 00:32:41.564
Mmm.

611
00:32:41.566 --> 00:32:44.700
But anything truly worthwhile
requires sacrifice.


612
00:32:44.702 --> 00:32:47.435
Music can't be
a part-time thing,


613
00:32:47.437 --> 00:32:49.136
particularly for
someone like you.


614
00:32:49.138 --> 00:32:51.373
I just play the fiddle.
It's no big deal.


615
00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:53.407
You don't just
play the fiddle, Keevey,


616
00:32:53.409 --> 00:32:57.445
really you don't.
You... You inhabit it.


617
00:32:57.447 --> 00:32:59.216
You have a special gift.

618
00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.451
Bet you say that
to all the violinists.


619
00:33:02.453 --> 00:33:05.022
No. Just you.

620
00:33:21.571 --> 00:33:27.643
Oh, wow, that was really,
really nice. Thank you.


621
00:33:27.645 --> 00:33:29.877
It's not very cool to thank
a girl for a kiss, Roland.


622
00:33:29.879 --> 00:33:32.047
It's a little weird.

623
00:33:32.049 --> 00:33:34.352
Oh, sorry. Of course, it's just,
you know, it's been a while.


624
00:33:38.222 --> 00:33:41.489
I like your hands.
They're really soft.


625
00:33:41.491 --> 00:33:45.493
Well I shampoo dogs for a living
and play a non-contact instrument.


626
00:33:45.495 --> 00:33:48.230
You're not going to build
up a lot of callouses.

628
00:33:53.337 --> 00:33:56.040
Maybe you should play a
contact instrument sometime.


629
00:34:03.047 --> 00:34:05.549
- Tea?
- Yes, please.


630
00:34:07.251 --> 00:34:09.318
It'll have to be herbal.
I don't have any milk.


631
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.354
I love herbal.

632
00:34:13.023 --> 00:34:14.025
Keevey?

633
00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:17.259
You need to make a plan.

634
00:34:17.261 --> 00:34:18.527
What sort of a plan?

635
00:34:18.529 --> 00:34:20.762
A music plan
to raise your game


636
00:34:20.764 --> 00:34:22.530
and match your potential.

637
00:34:22.532 --> 00:34:24.932
A gift like yours isn't going
to find that kind of stimulus


638
00:34:24.934 --> 00:34:28.269
playing crappy little
festivals like the Westival.


639
00:34:28.271 --> 00:34:29.938
It's a great little festival.

640
00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.106
It's too safe.

641
00:34:31.108 --> 00:34:33.041
It's too comfortable.

642
00:34:33.043 --> 00:34:36.277
What's the point of a festival if
it doesn't push the boundaries,


643
00:34:36.279 --> 00:34:39.380
invert forms?

644
00:34:39.382 --> 00:34:42.083
Instead, they book idiot
drummers with pirate hats


645
00:34:42.085 --> 00:34:44.052
and dinosaur pub rock bands

646
00:34:44.054 --> 00:34:46.556
like the West Australian
Rikins.


647
00:34:48.893 --> 00:34:51.925
I think they pronounce it
the WArrikins.


648
00:34:51.927 --> 00:34:54.561
It's a play on "larrikin."
The West Australian Larrikins.


649
00:34:54.563 --> 00:34:57.599
Oh, I didn't get that.

650
00:34:57.601 --> 00:34:58.900
Have you ever seen them play?

651
00:34:58.902 --> 00:35:00.568
I don't need to.

652
00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:02.970
I've read the program.
"A grand bit of Irish craic."


653
00:35:02.972 --> 00:35:06.708
If you've never seen an act, then how
can you know anything about them?


654
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.878
I've never seen the Earth's core
but I know that it's approximately


655
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.813
ninety percent
iron and nickel,


656
00:35:11.815 --> 00:35:14.548
and I know that
the West Australian Rikins


657
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:16.818
are at least
ninety percent shit.


658
00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.021
(SCOFFS)

659
00:35:19.757 --> 00:35:22.626
And you, Roland, are
one hundred percent asshole.


660
00:35:24.126 --> 00:35:25.827
Sorry?

661
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:27.530
Which is a shame, because
you have really nice hands.


662
00:35:27.532 --> 00:35:29.834
Now I need to get ready
for a gig and you need to go.


663
00:35:31.168 --> 00:35:33.034
But what about the herbal...

664
00:35:33.036 --> 00:35:35.503
The tea is canceled.

665
00:35:35.505 --> 00:35:36.605
Door is that way.

666
00:35:36.607 --> 00:35:38.407
Unless maybe you want to...

667
00:35:38.409 --> 00:35:41.979
Buy a poster, or a CD?
Eighteen bucks.


668
00:35:44.648 --> 00:35:45.650
Fuck.

669
00:35:48.652 --> 00:35:50.818
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

670
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.190
Hey hey, great Festival, eh? It's
great, isn't it? Hey, buddy.


671
00:35:55.793 --> 00:35:57.061
Pretentious twat.

672
00:36:06.837 --> 00:36:08.802
We're off to see a show,
Jafaar.


673
00:36:08.804 --> 00:36:10.137
You should come.

674
00:36:10.139 --> 00:36:11.706
Honest, the WArrikins
are brilliant.


675
00:36:11.708 --> 00:36:12.742
Who's pushing now?

676
00:36:14.143 --> 00:36:17.144
No? Okay, no worries.

677
00:36:17.146 --> 00:36:19.114
What are you writing? Letter?

678
00:36:19.116 --> 00:36:20.648
Don't interrogate him!

679
00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:23.585
I'm not interrogating him,
I'm talking to him.


680
00:36:23.587 --> 00:36:25.289
Well it sounds
like interrogating.


681
00:36:33.996 --> 00:36:35.398
Name's Henry, son.

682
00:36:36.567 --> 00:36:37.568
That's Ruby.

683
00:36:41.005 --> 00:36:42.670
- Adopted?
- Gramps!


684
00:36:42.672 --> 00:36:44.405
What?

685
00:36:44.407 --> 00:36:45.907
He's obviously not related.

686
00:36:45.909 --> 00:36:47.742
He's a completely
different color.


687
00:36:47.744 --> 00:36:48.746
Gramps!

688
00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.382
Fostered?

689
00:36:54.684 --> 00:36:56.351
Yeah, I was kinda
fostered myself.


690
00:36:56.353 --> 00:36:59.887
Not to a family,
to a farm school.


691
00:36:59.889 --> 00:37:02.623
They told him he was an
orphan, but he wasn't.


692
00:37:02.625 --> 00:37:05.360
Doesn't make a great deal
of difference, Rube.


693
00:37:05.362 --> 00:37:07.762
Well the Prime Minister
apologized.


694
00:37:07.764 --> 00:37:09.933
Not at the time, obviously.

695
00:37:11.434 --> 00:37:13.034
Chin up, son.

696
00:37:13.036 --> 00:37:14.735
No point in looking back.

697
00:37:14.737 --> 00:37:15.836
Gotta get on with it.

698
00:37:15.838 --> 00:37:16.940

Although a photocopy
is permissible, if witnessed.

00:39:34.945 --> 00:39:36.844
Well.

744
00:39:36.846 --> 00:39:39.713
Look who came to see the West
Australian Rikins, then.


745
00:39:39.715 --> 00:39:41.282
I didn't know

746
00:39:41.284 --> 00:39:42.550
it was your band.

747
00:39:42.552 --> 00:39:44.887
Mmm. Well now you do.

748
00:39:44.889 --> 00:39:47.322
So were we at least ninety
percent shit, as presumed?


749
00:39:47.324 --> 00:39:48.722
Look,

750
00:39:48.724 --> 00:39:51.492
I'm not gonna pretend
that pub rock is my scene.


751
00:39:51.494 --> 00:39:53.661
It is not pub rock.
It's folk rock.


752
00:39:53.663 --> 00:39:55.262
Folk rock is pub rock.

753
00:39:55.264 --> 00:39:56.364
The punters love it.

754
00:39:56.366 --> 00:39:57.434
Punters loved Hitler.

755
00:39:58.067 --> 00:39:59.733
Wow.

756
00:39:59.735 --> 00:40:01.471
That... That is a big leap.

757
00:40:06.442 --> 00:40:10.144
Well I'm here to sell CDs.
Do you wanna buy a CD?


758
00:40:10.146 --> 00:40:11.579
Yes.

759
00:40:11.581 --> 00:40:12.880
Yes I would.

760
00:40:12.882 --> 00:40:14.115
No, actually, you
can't have one


761
00:40:14.117 --> 00:40:16.184
because you don't
even like our music.


762
00:40:16.186 --> 00:40:18.052
So I suppose you're
loitering around


763
00:40:18.054 --> 00:40:20.121
to have another
shot at me for which,


764
00:40:20.123 --> 00:40:23.023
incidentally, you can wait until,
I don't' know, the end of time.


765
00:40:23.025 --> 00:40:24.858
Goodbye, Roland.

766
00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:28.262
Keevey, let me just
put your music on the net.


767
00:40:28.264 --> 00:40:29.630
We don't want
our music on the net.


768
00:40:29.632 --> 00:40:31.632
The WArrikins
are a live band.


769
00:40:31.634 --> 00:40:33.101
Live is what we do.

770
00:40:33.103 --> 00:40:35.603
I wasn't talking about
the WArrikins, just you.


771
00:40:35.605 --> 00:40:37.505
There is no just me, Roland.

772
00:40:37.507 --> 00:40:41.943
So you're happy playing
covers in a pub folk rock,


773
00:40:41.945 --> 00:40:43.778
pub folk band?

774
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.481
Oh no, I'd much rather be a
multi-instrumental genius dog washer.


775
00:40:46.483 --> 00:40:48.884
This isn't about me, Keevey.

776
00:40:48.886 --> 00:40:51.219
I think it is. I think
it is all about you.


777
00:40:51.221 --> 00:40:53.288
You are an inspired player.

778
00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:55.423
I'm just a technically
competent one.


779
00:40:55.425 --> 00:40:58.559
Have you heard of the
Académie Conservatoire?


780
00:40:58.561 --> 00:41:02.597
Of course, I've heard
of the Académie Conservatoire.


781
00:41:02.599 --> 00:41:04.599
I saw <i>Peter and the Wolf</i>
there when I was five.


782
00:41:04.601 --> 00:41:07.601
They do a one year
creative composition program.


783
00:41:07.603 --> 00:41:09.103
I was on it,
but I dropped out.


784
00:41:09.105 --> 00:41:12.005
Roland, I have absolutely
no qualifications.


785
00:41:12.007 --> 00:41:14.275
It's entrance by audition.

786
00:41:14.277 --> 00:41:15.943
And the Académie's

Whaddup?

1111

Yeah, it means "how's things."

Oh, I know what it means.

Congrats on the Koolaz thing,

It's pretty amazing.

Well thanks. I'm... I'm not gonna lie.
It feels pretty good.

What, pleasing a crowd?

1118

I pleased myself.

If other people like it,
well that's cool.

I get it. You think
my techno folk rap fusion is


1123

succumbing to populism?

1124

Well, it's popular, isn't it?

1125
01:00:01.402 --> 01:00:03.536
And you have
certainly succumbed.


1126
01:00:03.538 --> 01:00:06.639
I saw all those young ladies outside
your workshop, taking selfies.


1127
01:00:06.641 --> 01:00:08.809
I didn't succumb.
I've been embraced.

object to being popular.

Every level. Okay, okay, not...
Not every level.

I do admit I've been...

1133
01:00:24.125 --> 01:00:25.958
A little dismissive
of what you do.

Really? You think?

1135

You're angry at me because...

1136
01:00:29.264 --> 01:00:31.030
Because I've shown you
what you're scared to do.

To follow your talent.

1140
01:00:37.639 --> 01:00:40.173
I left an envelope
under your door.

Yeah, an application for the
Conservatoire. I got it.

Well clearly you
didn't act on it


1143
01:00:44.514 --> 01:00:46.313
because I know they
would have killed for...


1144
01:00:46.315 --> 01:00:47.817
Actually I did.

1145
01:00:49.485 --> 01:00:51.452
You did?

1146
01:00:51.454 --> 01:00:54.057
Yeah, I applied and I auditioned
and I was sent on my way.


1147
01:00:58.025 --> 01:00:59.826
I keep it with me
just to remind me

I knew it,
they certainly knew it

still don't know it is

Come on, Roland, be honest.

If I was a 50-year-old
fat dude

would you really be so concerned
about my unique talent?

1403
01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:31.297
Interesting article on the
advanced vacuum distributor.


1404
01:15:31.299 --> 01:15:32.266
Hmm.

1405
01:15:33.835 --> 01:15:36.869
Red and white wristbands
are required


1406
01:15:36.871 --> 01:15:40.071
for express glamping
bathroom access.


1407
01:15:40.073 --> 01:15:44.510
White and red wristbands for the
general purpose bathroom facility.


1408
01:15:44.512 --> 01:15:48.080
If the red part of the band
is closest to the armpit,


1409
01:15:48.082 --> 01:15:50.081
then you are good
for glamping.


1410
01:15:50.083 --> 01:15:53.619
If the white part of the wristband
is closest to the armpit,


1411
01:15:53.621 --> 01:15:55.687
then you must only access

1412
01:15:55.689 --> 01:15:58.089
general purpose
bathroom facility.


1413
01:15:58.091 --> 01:15:59.192
(TOILET FLUSHING)

1414
01:15:59.194 --> 01:16:00.162
Is that clear?

1415
01:16:01.595 --> 01:16:03.461
- WOMAN 1: Ooh!
- WOMAN 2: Ah!


1416
01:16:03.463 --> 01:16:04.466
Good to go.

1417
01:16:05.399 --> 01:16:06.434
Steady.

1418
01:16:15.076 --> 01:16:18.611
<i>You've given us such
a special night tonight.</i>


1419
01:16:18.613 --> 01:16:20.182
<i>What has been
special for you?</i>


1420
01:16:22.617 --> 01:16:23.619
<i>Well, Queenie</i>

1421
01:16:25.452 --> 01:16:29.888
<i>we come from a place
where there is no music,</i>


1422
01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:31.723
<i>no laughter.</i>

1423
01:16:31.725 --> 01:16:34.626
<i>A place where our freedom
is oppressed,</i>


1424
01:16:34.628 --> 01:16:37.064
<i>where we are imprisoned
without trial,</i>


1425
01:16:38.466 --> 01:16:39.501
<i>without hope.</i>

1426
01:16:40.935 --> 01:16:43.505
<i>My friends,
we come from hell.</i>


1427
01:16:47.073 --> 01:16:49.142
<i>But the hell I described</i>

1428
01:16:49.144 --> 01:16:52.277
<i>is not the homeland
we ran from,</i>


1429
01:16:52.279 --> 01:16:54.116
<i>seeking freedom
and a better life.</i>


1430
01:16:56.650 --> 01:16:59.852
<i>It is in the land we ran to.</i>

1431
01:16:59.854 --> 01:17:03.455
<i>The hell I described
is the detention camp</i>


1432
01:17:03.457 --> 01:17:05.226
<i>where we are imprisoned
without hope.</i>


1433
01:17:08.162 --> 01:17:09.231
<i>We are forgotten.</i>

1434
01:17:10.297 --> 01:17:11.332
<i>We are dying.</i>

1435
01:17:13.435 --> 01:17:15.200
<i>I would like to
thank Queenie</i>


1436
01:17:15.202 --> 01:17:18.538
<i>and the Westival organizers
for arranging this concert</i>


1437
01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:20.141
<i>and the authorities
for allowing it.</i>


1438
01:17:21.609 --> 01:17:22.743
<i>But above all,</i>

1439
01:17:24.813 --> 01:17:27.013
<i>I would like to thank
my young friend, Jafaar,</i>


1440
01:17:27.015 --> 01:17:28.550
<i>for thinking
of the whole plan.</i>


1441
01:17:30.685 --> 01:17:34.152
<i>Jafaar was just ten
when he arrived in Australia.</i>


1442
01:17:34.154 --> 01:17:36.657
<i>He had lost his parents
and his home.</i>


1443
01:17:38.159 --> 01:17:39.293
<i>When he came, he was</i>

1444
01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:44.131
<i>confused. He was alone.
Was traumatized.</i>


1445
01:17:47.033 --> 01:17:48.335
<i>And Australia was</i>

1446
01:17:49.804 --> 01:17:52.871
<i>not kind to him,
did not welcome him.</i>


1447
01:17:52.873 --> 01:17:55.242
<i>It put him in that camp.</i>

1448
01:18:03.216 --> 01:18:05.753
<i>I can see that our brief
moment of freedom is over.</i>


1449
01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.724
<i>We must return to camp.</i>

1450
01:18:10.925 --> 01:18:12.194
<i>We've lost everything,</i>

1451
01:18:13.528 --> 01:18:14.963
<i>and we ask for nothing.</i>

1452
01:18:16.596 --> 01:18:18.599
<i>Nothing but the chance
to begin again.</i>


1453
01:18:19.833 --> 01:18:20.801
<i>So please,</i>

1454
01:18:21.903 --> 01:18:23.038
<i>remember our name.</i>

1455
01:18:23.938 --> 01:18:26.608
<i>Umid. Hope.</i>

1456
01:18:33.347 --> 01:18:35.250
(APPLAUSE)

1457
01:18:50.599 --> 01:18:51.900
We've never
done that before.


1458
01:18:52.699 --> 01:18:53.702
No.

1459
01:18:59.707 --> 01:19:00.808
It's a change.

1460
01:19:05.412 --> 01:19:07.547
No, I'm sorry Jools,
I don't want to do this.


1461
01:19:07.549 --> 01:19:09.949
Babes, we're right here.
Come on...


1462
01:19:09.951 --> 01:19:11.883
No, I really I don't want to.

1463
01:19:11.885 --> 01:19:14.152
I thought I did, but I've
changed my mind, okay?


1464
01:19:14.154 --> 01:19:15.388
Oh, you've changed
your mind.


1465
01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:17.824
Okay, what am I? A pizza?

1466
01:19:17.826 --> 01:19:19.924
Why would you Tinder me
if you don't want a root?


1467
01:19:19.926 --> 01:19:22.227
Swiping right
isn't a contract, okay?


1468
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:23.995
It is an expression
of interest


1469
01:19:23.997 --> 01:19:26.264
and I have lost interest.

1470
01:19:26.266 --> 01:19:27.633
Oh, come on, babes.

1471
01:19:27.635 --> 01:19:29.035
It's too late to hook up
with anyone else.


1472
01:19:29.037 --> 01:19:30.570
Let's just do it.
It's fine.


1473
01:19:30.572 --> 01:19:32.340
I said no, Jools!

1474
01:19:33.241 --> 01:19:35.277
Now fuck off.

1475
01:19:45.152 --> 01:19:47.122
Hey, thanks for the great
bloody evening,


1476
01:19:48.122 --> 01:19:49.690
in opposite world,

1477
01:19:50.658 --> 01:19:53.558
you prick-teasing bitch!

1478
01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.227
EAMON: Hey!

1479
01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:57.429
That's my daughter
you're talking to.


1480
01:19:57.431 --> 01:19:59.132
And what are you
gonna do about it?


1481
01:19:59.134 --> 01:20:00.402
Yeah, mate?

1482
01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:08.874
Dad, stop it!
Leave him alone.


1483
01:20:08.876 --> 01:20:10.642
Be careful, lad.

1484
01:20:10.644 --> 01:20:13.845
You're half my age but in a
fight, what counts is experience.


1485
01:20:13.847 --> 01:20:15.917
Get out of here
before he kills you.


1486
01:20:16.516 --> 01:20:17.586
Go on!

1487
01:20:19.519 --> 01:20:23.022
Dad, you can't just punch
people out for being dickheads.


1488
01:20:23.024 --> 01:20:24.790
Really, love?

1489
01:20:24.792 --> 01:20:27.959
I thought that's exactly
why you did punch them out.


1490
01:20:27.961 --> 01:20:30.663
I'm always going
to be here for you, Keevey.


1491
01:20:30.665 --> 01:20:31.899
You know that, don't you?

1492
01:20:33.033 --> 01:20:34.169
Yeah I know, Dad.

1493
01:20:42.943 --> 01:20:45.044
QUEENIE: (ON RADIO)
<i>Goodness gracious</i>

01:21:10.237 --> 01:21:14.072
pray for the strength
to keep going.


1500
01:21:14.074 --> 01:21:16.644
My name is Smoko and
I'm four hours sober.


1501
01:21:19.512 --> 01:21:21.448
To be clear, Smoko

1502
01:21:22.582 --> 01:21:25.751
four hours sober
means four hours


1503
01:21:25.753 --> 01:21:27.852
consciously pursuing sobriety,

1504
01:21:27.854 --> 01:21:32.357
not four hours
unconsciously shitfaced.


1505
01:21:32.359 --> 01:21:34.396
You do see the distinction?

1506
01:21:38.399 --> 01:21:42.701
<i>This year we have another real
community star to celebrate,</i>


1507
01:21:42.703 --> 01:21:44.236

1508
01:21:44.238 --> 01:21:46.705
<i>It's the Westival itself!</i>

1509

Hey, I'm glad you
shaved that beard off.

Wasn't a fan.

1519
01:22:36.991 --> 01:22:39.991
I don't want to hear anything else

"While we accept initial

The WArrikins'. My Dad's.

1526

It's the only one we've got.

1527
01:22:59.613 --> 01:23:02.016

Another Westival,
another round.


1536
01:23:30.878 --> 01:23:32.910
I need to lubricate
my picking fingers.


1537
01:23:32.912 --> 01:23:34.413
It's a great gig, isn't it?

Keevey, darling,
will you have a beer?


1539
01:23:39.554 --> 01:23:41.855
Roland accessed your
deleted emails, Da.


1540
01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:46.392
He doesn't know
the password.


1541
01:23:46.394 --> 01:23:50.327
"thewarrikins," all lower case.
I got it in one.


1542
01:23:50.329 --> 01:23:52.164
They accepted me.

1543
01:23:52.166 --> 01:23:54.967
They even offered me a scholarship.
You deleted the email.


1544
01:23:54.969 --> 01:23:57.204
You forged a rejection letter.

1545
01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:00.909
And how can you do it?

1546
01:24:01.876 --> 01:24:03.043
You're my Dad.

1547
01:24:08.248 --> 01:24:10.717
I didn't mean to... I...

1548
01:24:11.519 --> 01:24:12.487
It was...

1549
01:24:15.855 --> 01:24:18.290
When I got that email,

1550
01:24:18.292 --> 01:24:21.563
I was so pleased for you, darling.
I really was. And...


1551
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:23.231
And uh...

1552
01:24:28.069 --> 01:24:31.639
And then...
Then I got scared.


1553
01:24:34.609 --> 01:24:36.144
Keevey, I...

1554
01:24:38.945 --> 01:24:40.814
I didn't know what
I'd do without you.


1555
01:24:45.118 --> 01:24:46.286
But you're all we've got.

1556
01:24:54.761 --> 01:24:55.929
You're all I've got.

1557
01:25:08.475 --> 01:25:09.942
What was the other thing?

1558
01:25:09.944 --> 01:25:11.142
What?

1559
01:25:11.144 --> 01:25:13.111
You said you had
two things to tell me.


1560
01:25:13.113 --> 01:25:15.112
What was the other thing?

1561
01:25:15.114 --> 01:25:16.617
Oh right, well...

1562
01:25:19.452 --> 01:25:21.822
I was going to mention
that I'm in love with you.


1563
01:25:24.158 --> 01:25:26.361
It's probably the wrong time.

1564
01:25:27.027 --> 01:25:28.061
Maybe a bit.

(SIGHS)

1566
01:25:53.421 --> 01:25:55.056
Your Dad did
a terrible thing, love.


1567
01:25:56.323 --> 01:25:57.692
But he's a sick man.

1568
01:25:59.092 --> 01:26:01.863
He's a sick, lonely old man.

1569
01:26:07.801 --> 01:26:08.969
Hello, Keevey.

1570
01:26:10.938 --> 01:26:13.371
Didn't know you had
a problem with drinking.


1571
01:26:13.373 --> 01:26:15.741
She's had a problem with
drinking all her life, mate.


1572
01:26:15.743 --> 01:26:16.744
Yours.

1573
01:26:19.079 --> 01:26:20.582
Yeah well,
things to do.


1574
01:26:30.524 --> 01:26:31.526
Well, Pam.

1575
01:26:38.832 --> 01:26:40.467
Can you help me?

1576
01:26:44.204 --> 01:26:46.670
Let's hear it
for Henry Foreman


1577
01:26:46.672 --> 01:26:52.244
and Chief Squire of the Merry
Morris Men of Olde England.

(APPLAUDING)

1579
01:26:58.252 --> 01:26:59.287
Thank you, Queenie.

1580
01:27:02.488 --> 01:27:05.223
Well this is a lovely little
festival, isn't it?


1581
01:27:05.225 --> 01:27:08.427
We all meet, we all mix.

1582
01:27:08.429 --> 01:27:11.996
"Australia in a tent,"
as Queenie likes to call it.


1583
01:27:11.998 --> 01:27:15.500
You have all sorts of people
come along to Westival,


1584
01:27:15.502 --> 01:27:16.903
with all sorts of stories.

1585
01:27:18.805 --> 01:27:20.073
Now take mine, for instance.

1586
01:27:21.609 --> 01:27:24.575
I didn't have
the easiest start in life.


1587
01:27:24.577 --> 01:27:26.544
No, not complaining,
you understand,


1588
01:27:26.546 --> 01:27:31.116
just... Just saying.
And it made me who I am.


1589
01:27:31.118 --> 01:27:35.122
A fellow who even my mates
sometimes find hard to like.


1590
01:27:37.658 --> 01:27:40.325
Who even my lovely
grand-daughter sometimes


1591
01:27:40.327 --> 01:27:42.428
found hard to like.

1592
01:27:42.430 --> 01:27:45.964
I think the problem was that I was
only looking at my own story,


1593
01:27:45.966 --> 01:27:48.436
as if it was the only one
that mattered.


1594
01:27:50.104 --> 01:27:52.240
And then I started
to have a look around,


1595
01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:55.443
at all the other people
in the tent.


1596
01:27:56.743 --> 01:27:58.145
Like young Jessie here.

1597
01:27:59.112 --> 01:28:00.114
And Jafaar.

1598
01:28:01.815 --> 01:28:04.148
And I heard Jafaar's story
and I realized


1599
01:28:04.150 --> 01:28:06.317
that it wasn't

1600
01:28:06.319 --> 01:28:08.255
all that different
from my own.


1601
01:28:09.422 --> 01:28:10.824
What I reckon is

1602
01:28:13.226 --> 01:28:16.430
that unless we start listening
to each other's stories,


1603
01:28:18.131 --> 01:28:20.534
we won't begin to
understand our own.


1604
01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:24.135
So today in my
capacity as Foreman


1605
01:28:24.137 --> 01:28:29.176
and Chief Squire of the Merry
Morris Men of Olde England, WA,


1606
01:28:30.711 --> 01:28:34.012
I would like to honor
and celebrate


1607
01:28:34.014 --> 01:28:36.384
the oldest Australian story
of them all.


1608
01:28:38.351 --> 01:28:41.120
And I'd like
to thank you, Jack...


1609
01:28:41.122 --> 01:28:44.290
For allowing me
to share in your, uh,


1610
01:28:44.292 --> 01:28:46.894
your culture and your spirit.

(DIDGERIDOO PLAYING)

(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)

1613
01:30:32.299 --> 01:30:36.767
I am seeking to contact
one of the festival artists.


1614
01:30:36.769 --> 01:30:38.336
Kindly assist me.

1615
01:30:38.338 --> 01:30:40.638
I do not see
a wrist tag, madam.


1616
01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:44.311
Health and safety regs require
all visitors to have one.


1617
01:30:45.613 --> 01:30:47.478
Do I look like
the kind of person


1618
01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:50.782
to allow my wrist
to be tagged?


1619
01:30:50.784 --> 01:30:55.486
Well you will not have
access to the portaloos.


1620
01:30:55.488 --> 01:30:59.924
I will not require
access to the portaloos.


1621
01:30:59.926 --> 01:31:02.995
I would rather die.

1622
01:31:02.997 --> 01:31:06.263
Where I went to school,
girls were taught to hold on.


1623
01:31:06.265 --> 01:31:09.002
Are you going to assist me
or aren't you?


1624
01:31:16.609 --> 01:31:19.313
You look like a very smart,
efficient, useful kind of girl.


1625
01:31:27.887 --> 01:31:30.024
Madam, how can I
help you, madam?


1626
01:31:33.194 --> 01:31:34.395
That remains to be seen.

1627
01:31:44.203 --> 01:31:45.572
- (KNOCKING ON GLASS)
- Hi.


1628
01:31:47.541 --> 01:31:49.174
Thought maybe
you'd come by.


1629
01:31:49.176 --> 01:31:51.175
Well, no. I thought
that you know...


1630
01:31:51.177 --> 01:31:54.344
You'd have a lot to think about,
what with your Dad and all.


1631
01:31:54.346 --> 01:31:56.013
Well not really.

1632
01:31:56.015 --> 01:31:57.883
When he's been dry a
year then we can talk.


1633
01:31:57.885 --> 01:32:00.451
I'm going to play tonight's
gig and then after that,


1634
01:32:00.453 --> 01:32:01.820
he's on his own.

1635
01:32:01.822 --> 01:32:03.655
But guess who did
come to see me?


1636
01:32:03.657 --> 01:32:04.723
Who?

1637
01:32:04.725 --> 01:32:05.991
Professor Wellborn.

1638
01:32:05.993 --> 01:32:07.492
- Ah, good.
- She said she spoke to you?


1639
01:32:07.494 --> 01:32:09.893
Yes, I... I did.
I hope that's okay.


1640
01:32:09.895 --> 01:32:11.663
Yeah, of course it is.

1641
01:32:11.665 --> 01:32:12.998
In fact, she, uh,

1642
01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.601
she still wants me
for the scholarship.


1643
01:32:15.469 --> 01:32:16.436
That's great.

1644
01:32:18.005 --> 01:32:19.336
Yeah.

1645
01:32:19.338 --> 01:32:20.839
Well I told her
I'd think about it.


1646
01:32:20.841 --> 01:32:22.241
You'd think about it?

1647
01:32:22.243 --> 01:32:24.642
Yeah, well you know,
there's a lot to take in.


1648
01:32:24.644 --> 01:32:26.580
Besides, anyway, I mainly
talked to her about you.


1649
01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:29.179
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.


1650
01:32:29.181 --> 01:32:31.049
She told me all about

1651
01:32:31.051 --> 01:32:33.684
how you inspired her to
audition for the Conservatoire.


1652
01:32:33.686 --> 01:32:35.219
Hello Professor Wellborn,

1653
01:32:35.221 --> 01:32:36.955
I didn't realize
you were still here.


1654
01:32:36.957 --> 01:32:38.623
She wants to talk to you.

1655
01:32:38.625 --> 01:32:40.224
About what?

1656
01:32:40.226 --> 01:32:41.860
About music!

1657
01:32:41.862 --> 01:32:44.362
Keevey tells me that
you love to talk about music.


1658
01:32:44.364 --> 01:32:46.630
And you can play it
on ten different instruments.


1659
01:32:46.632 --> 01:32:48.599
Yes, Keevey,
but there are ten people


1660
01:32:48.601 --> 01:32:49.867
that are better
on each of those.


1661
01:32:49.869 --> 01:32:51.068
Maybe a hundred.

1662
01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:52.803
Not everybody can
be the best.


1663
01:32:52.805 --> 01:32:55.607
But everybody can be the
best that they can be.


1664
01:32:55.609 --> 01:32:58.442
But to achieve that,
they need enablers, Roland.


1665
01:32:58.444 --> 01:33:00.544
Mentors and tutors who can

1666
01:33:00.546 --> 01:33:03.080
see their potential but have
a passion for unlocking it.


1667
01:33:03.082 --> 01:33:04.616
She means teachers, Roland.

1668
01:33:04.618 --> 01:33:05.918
Come and work for me.

1669
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:08.218
Unlock talent, enable passion.

1670
01:33:08.220 --> 01:33:12.492
You can start by convincing Keevey
here to take up her scholarship.


1671
01:33:14.961 --> 01:33:17.396
Linda and I
are leaving now.


1672
01:33:17.398 --> 01:33:20.432
But I will be expecting
to hear from both of you.


1673
01:33:20.434 --> 01:33:22.302
Oh, don't disappoint me.

1674
01:33:27.373 --> 01:33:30.241
Do not disappoint her.

1675
01:33:30.243 --> 01:33:31.212
ELIZABETH: Linda!

1676
01:33:35.416 --> 01:33:38.450
Wow, I seem to be
the object of some sort of


1677
01:33:38.452 --> 01:33:40.184
intervention.

1678
01:33:40.186 --> 01:33:42.456
Well yeah, it's a bit of a taste
of your own medicine, huh?


1679
01:33:43.756 --> 01:33:45.824
Come on Roland, be a teacher.

1680
01:33:45.826 --> 01:33:49.230
It's what you do. Will you
give yourself a chance?


1681
01:33:49.963 --> 01:33:51.361
I don't know.

1682
01:33:51.363 --> 01:33:52.366
Maybe.

1683
01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.032
Will you?

1684
01:33:55.034 --> 01:33:56.934
I don't know.

1685
01:33:56.936 --> 01:33:58.436
I mean, I think I want to.

1686
01:33:58.438 --> 01:34:00.272
Well you're gonna
have to now,


1687
01:34:00.274 --> 01:34:02.843
otherwise, Professor Wellborn
will set her girlfriend on me.


1688
01:34:07.448 --> 01:34:09.614
And then there's
the other thing.


1689
01:34:09.616 --> 01:34:11.016
The other thing?

1690
01:34:11.018 --> 01:34:13.250
You said that you
were in love with me.


1691
01:34:13.252 --> 01:34:15.152
And I was just
really confused.


1692
01:34:15.154 --> 01:34:16.655
You know, it was...

1693
01:34:16.657 --> 01:34:19.790
It was so the wrong time
and actually I'm...


1694
01:34:19.792 --> 01:34:21.992
I'm sorry because I... I
shouldn't have said anything...


1695
01:34:21.994 --> 01:34:23.928
Roland, Roland, Roland!

1696
01:34:23.930 --> 01:34:26.667
I was confused because
it made me realize that...


1697
01:34:29.702 --> 01:34:31.503
Well I'm...

1698
01:34:31.505 --> 01:34:33.674
I'm totally
in love with you too.


1699
01:34:35.341 --> 01:34:36.407
Really?

1700
01:34:36.409 --> 01:34:37.875
Yeah, really.

1701
01:34:37.877 --> 01:34:39.343
But just... I was scared.

1702
01:34:39.345 --> 01:34:40.411
Why?

1703
01:34:40.413 --> 01:34:42.813
Because love
is based on trust


1704
01:34:42.815 --> 01:34:44.182
and I barely know you.

1705
01:34:44.184 --> 01:34:45.983
You know, we've had
one amazing kiss


1706
01:34:45.985 --> 01:34:47.718
and about fifteen
massive fights


1707
01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:52.258
and we're just not
exactly an obvious fit.


1708
01:34:54.060 --> 01:34:56.130
But the best harmonies
never are.


1709
01:34:58.698 --> 01:35:00.567
Your lines are
really improving.
