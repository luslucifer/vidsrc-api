00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.951
<i>Yo, not gonna lie.</i>

2
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.182
<i>
- This sound...</i>

3
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.025
<i>gets me hard as a fucking rock.</i>

4
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.941
<i>But I don't like to go too fast
right off the bat.</i>


5
00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.425
<i>I'd rather work my way into it,
nice and easy.</i>


6
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.548
<i>So I'll start off with
some stills.</i>


7
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.309
<i>Then, once I'm getting into it,</i>

8
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.144
<i>I start looking for</i> a <i>video.</i>

9
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.427
<i>I never actually touch my cock
till I find the right clip.</i>


10
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.344
<i>Then, once I do...</i>

11
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.309
<i>...goodbye</i>

12
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.582
<i>For the next few minutes,
all the bullshit fades away,</i>


13
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.910
<i>and the only thing in the world
is those tits...</i>


14
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.630
<i>...that ass...</i>

15
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.741
<i>...the blowjob, the cowboy,</i>

16
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.461
<i>the doggy, the moneyshot, and that's it.
I don't gotta say anything,</i>


17
00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.104
<i>I don't gotta do anything.
I just fucking lose myself.</i>


18
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.467
<i>There's only a few things
I really care about in life.</i>


19
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.666
<i>My body...</i>

20
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.666
<i>...my pad...</i>

21
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.911
<i>...my ride...</i>

22
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.870
<i>...my family...</i>

23
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.067
Amen.

24
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.301
<i>...my church...</i>

25
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.143
<i>- ...my boys...</i>

26
00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.427
<i>...my girls...</i>

27
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.863
<i>...and my porn.</i>

28
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.585
<i>I know that last one sounds weird,
but I'm just being honest.</i>


29
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.949
<i>Nothing else does it for me the same way.
Not even real pussy.</i>


30
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.387
<i>And, yo, I get plenty of that.</i>

31
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.588
<i>Why you think my boys
call me The Don?</i>


32
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.267
- Jonny-Boy!
- Don Jon, what's good, baby?


33
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.421
- What up?
- You good?


34
00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.150
- I'm all right.
- Jonny, look at me.


35
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.029
- Everything good with you?
- What's the matter with this guy?


36
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.467
- Come here, you animal!
- Get the fuck off of me!


37
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.191
Real talk, real talk. Purple.

38
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.581
- That's not bad.
- It's better than "not bad."


39
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.862
- You ain't see her turn around.
- You calling her a seven?


40
00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.829
- An eight. At least an eight.
- That is not an eight.


41
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.790
She's cute in the face, you can maybe
call the face an eight, tits are a four.


42
00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.581
Yeah, but the butt, man, it's exceptional.
I'm telling you. It changes everything.


43
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.344
- Shit!
- What?


44
00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.066
- Sequins. Don't look. Don't look.
- What? Who is that?


45
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.382
- You don't remember her?
- She's coming over here.


46
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.941
'Cause you're staring right at her.

47
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.904
- Look who the fuck it is.
- How you doing?


48
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.507
- Why didn't you call me back?
- Come on. You're a grown woman.


49
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.788
Did you think I was
gonna call you back?


50
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.626
You're pathetic, you know that?
Every week you got a new bitch.


51
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.427
Then Why'd you come home with me?

52
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.341
Fuck you!

53
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.185
- Eight.
- No, that might be a nine.


54
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.342
- You shitting me? That's a seven.
- You're out of your fucking mind!


55
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.901
I gave you the eight,
your record's intact. Chill out.


56
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.789
You heard what she said?
Everyone knows about the streak.


57
00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.307
- You're sick. You know that?
- I don't know what's wrong with me.


58
00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.064
- Oh, my... damn!
- What? What? Where?


59
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.303
- Red.
- Holy shit! That's a dime.


60
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.106
- That is a dime.
- Nah, she's hot, but it's not a dime.


61
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.025
I don't even mess with blondes like that,
but that there is a dime!


62
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.023
- Fuck yeah.
- I don't know, there might be


63
00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.989
- some lasagna up in there.
- I don't think so.


64
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.467
Definitely not. She keep her
shit tight, you can tell.


65
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.861
- No. I don't know.
- See, he likes that skinny shit.


66
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.024
He likes that skinny, high-fashion,
looks-like-a-boy shit.


67
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.306
- Fuck you!
- Admit it!


68
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.782
- He's kind of right, man, you do.
- I don't like more than a handful of titty.


69
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.508
No, no, no, no, no. No. A nice handful,
I love it, but more than that, it's like no!


70
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.742
Shit starts to remind me
of my mom or something.


71
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.506
- Jesus Christ.
- Your mom do got some big-ass titties.


72
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.668
- Don't talk about my mother.
- You brought up your mother.


73
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.107
If you don't like that,
there's something wrong with you.


74
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.422
I didn't say I didn't like it.
I said it's not a dime.


75
00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.021
- That's incorrect.
- She's taller than you anyway.


76
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.182
- Fuck you, Jonny.
- I'm playing, come on.


77
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.621
You gonna get that?

78
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.506
Let me get a vodka-cranberry.

79
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.509
Jonny!
- Sammy-boy, how you doing?


80
00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.186
- You good?
- Let me get a Grey Goose and soda.


81
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.940
- What makes you think you could do that?
- Do what?


82
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.228
- Get the fuck out of here.
- You wanna go somewhere?


83
00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.064
- Fuck you.
- You wanna fuck me?


84
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.870
- Is that why you kissed me?
- I didn't kiss you.


85
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.351
Yeah, you did.

86
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.470
Stop it, I mean it. Stop it.

87
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.100
Come on. Let me buy you a drink.
It's early.


88
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.150
- Where you going?
- I told you where I was going.


89
00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.581
Come on! Wait a minute!

90
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.787
Shit!

91
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.062
Yo. Headband.

92
00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:49.110
Nah, I don't know.

93
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.224
<i>See?
This is what I'm saying.</i>


94
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.145
<i>Real pussy's all good.
But I'm sorry.</i>


95
00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.871
<i>It's not as good as porn.</i>

96
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.351
<i>Tits?</i>

97
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.345
<i>Great.</i>

98
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.831
<i>Ass?</i>

99
00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.391
<i>Great.</i>

100
00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.224
<i>Blow-job</i>

101
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.942
<i>Sure, it's fucking fantastic
in person... if she'll do it.</i>


102
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.950
<i>But in real life, if you wanna get head,
you gotta give head.</i>


103
00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.711
Lower. Not that low!

104
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.307
<i>I know, some guys love eating pussy,
but the thing about those guys is,</i>


105
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:14.791
<i>they're fucking crazy.</i>

106
00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.905
<i>Don't get me wrong,</i>
<i>I like a good pussy-eating clip.</i>


107
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.951
<i>But, from down here,
there's nothing good about this.</i>


108
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:29.984
<i>And if she does finally decide
to do you the big favor...</i>


109
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.506
<i>...she's in a fucking hurry.</i>

110
00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:38.107
<i>Now, when it comes to
the actual fucking...</i>


111
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.104
<i>First of all, condoms are terrible.
They just are.</i>


112
00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:43.904
<i>But you gotta wear one, 'cause,</i>

113
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.781
<i>- unlike porn, real pussy can kill you.</i>

114
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:53.151
<i>Second of all, missionary is the
worst position in all of fucking.</i>


115
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.622
<i>The tits lie flat,
you can't see her ass,</i>


116
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.187
<i>you can't touch her ass,
'cause she's lying on her back.</i>


117
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.470
<i>They won't let you do it from behind,
'cause they wanna look at you.</i>


118
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.911
<i>And basically it's on
me to do all the work.</i>


119
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.428
<i>Moneyshot? No.
There is no real-life moneyshot.</i>


120
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.988
<i>Real girls won't do that shit. You just
gotta cum into the fucking condom.</i>


121
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.103
<i>So, you tell me,
which looks better?</i>


122
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.904
<i>This?</i>

123
00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.910
<i>Or this?</i>

124
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.866
Jesus! What are you fucking retarded?!
You're fucking retarded!


125
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.867
You're a retarded person
and you're driving a fucking car!


126
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:49.751
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>


127
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.665
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>


128
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.663
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>


129
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:58.142
- Tell me your sins.
- Since last Sunday, I had sexual relations


130
00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:03.147
out of wedlock two times. I also watched
pornographic videos and masturbated 17 times.


131
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.382
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.


132
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.111
- Ten Lord's Prayers and ten Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.


133
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.786
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,</i>


134
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.149
and I absolve you from your sins in the name
of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.


135
00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:15.301
Amen.

136
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:19.300
Bullshit! Bullshit! Did you see that?
That was fucking bullshit. Bad call.


137
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.344
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Jon!


138
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.788
- Fucking bullshit. Did you see that?
- Nah, I didn't see it. What happened?


139
00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.465
They'll do a replay.
They better do a fucking replay.


140
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.430
Unless they just don't want us
to see how bad that fucking call was.


141
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:32.389
Why don't you get the thing
where you can pause...


142
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.622
- Assholes, where's the replay?!
- Dad, there's a thing you can pause


143
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.464
- and rewind.
- What are you talking about?


144
00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.224
It's digital.
You just rewind and watch it.


145
00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.906
- I'm not taping this.
- No, I know you're not taping it.


146
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.303
- Are you people serious, no fucking replay?!
- I'm not talking about a VCR.


147
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.542
How do I know what the fuck
you're talking about?


148
00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:49.271
I don't know, I guess 'cause most
American people have heard of TiVo.


149
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.741
Most people that pay attention
to the world around them!


150
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.062
Here it is.
Shut up already, finally. Shit!


151
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.941
- You seriously never heard of that?
- Yes! I've heard of it, Jesus fucking...


152
00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.150
There! Look, his foot's on the line!
Look at that bullshit!


153
00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.667
- Jon! All right already!
- So if you've heard of it,


154
00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.106
- what is it?
- Did you see that?


155
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.667
- I'm asking you a question.
- It's a fucking thing...


156
00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.630
Wait a minute. Did you see that?
I'm asking you.


157
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.669
- Did you?
- Nah, I didn't see it.


158
00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:15.549
Why not?! What the fuck's
the matter with you?


159
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.421
I said look at this play,
I said it right to you!


160
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.265
I ask you to do the easiest fucking
thing, and you can't do it!


161
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.264
- At least I know what a fucking TiVo is.
- I know what a fucking TiVo is!


162
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.070
You want a TiVo?
Is that what you're saying?


163
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.188
- I would love a fucking TiVo.
- Who do you love?


164
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.311
He loves TiVo. He sure as shit
don't love football. We know that.


165
00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.944
One of these days, I'm gonna sit down here
and start eating, and you're gonna say,


166
00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.784
- "Mom, I found her."
Ma!


167
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:49.305
One of these days.

168
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:59.587
Holy Mary... Mother of God...

169
00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.868
...pray for us now...

170
00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.028
...and at the hour of death...

171
00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.504
Amen.

172
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.101
Hail Mary... full of grace...

173
00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.910
<i>All right, I'll admit,</i>

174
00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:18.664
<i>there are some downsides.</i>

175
00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:22.347
<i>Like there's the times you
find a great clip, with a hot chick.</i>


176
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:26.864
<i>And right when you're starting to cum,
it shows the guy.</i>


177
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:31.705
Fuck! Goddamn it!

178
00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.990
<i>It's no one's fault, really,
but it still sucks. So...</i>


179
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:39.223
<i>Also, nowadays you got so much</i>

180
00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:43.510
<i>to choose from, finding just the
right clip can take a lot of time.</i>


181
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.389
<i>And my time is precious to me.</i>

182
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:48.828
<i>Yeah, I got shit to do. So...</i>

183
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.348
<i>And, every once in a while,</i>

184
00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:56.744
<i>you find a clip that's so good,
it's fucking depressing.</i>


185
00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.824
<i>And you're thinking to yourself,
why can't real pussy be like this?</i>


186
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.029
<i>You know, I smash new girls
all the fucking time,</i>


187
00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.662
<i>always an eight or better, and it's still</i>
<i>never this good. What am I doing wrong?</i>


188
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.463
<i>Maybe it's time to
try something new. So...</i>


189
00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.166
Yo, you remember that
dime from last week?


190
00:14:24.192 --> 00:14:24.811
Oh, shit.

191
00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.506
The blonde in the dress?
She was insane, bro. You hit that?


192
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.584
No, I didn't, you fucking alcoholic,
I saw you after she left.


193
00:14:30.740 --> 00:14:32.981
- Fuck you, Jonny!
- I thought you made that happen.


194
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.949
- I threw it to this other random.
- Typical.


195
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.829
- Probably an eight or nine.
- Six or seven.


196
00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:38.903
Shut the fuck up!
Who'd you take home, huh?


197
00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:43.224
Twos and threes, baby. I'm telling you, twos
and threes are some open-minded ladies.


198
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.190
- I wanna find that girl.
- You get her name?


199
00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.025
- Her name?
- First and last name.


200
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.786
I'm looking for her name,
first and last name.


201
00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.908
Shit, I don't know.
You know who would?


202
00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.543
- Barbara Sugarman.
- Sugarman?


203
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.031
Thanks, bro.

204
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.700
- OK, what was it again?
- Barbara Sugarman.


205
00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.580
- You see her anywhere?
- No.


206
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.024
- Oh, shit!
- That's her?


207
00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:15.309
- That's definitely her.
- Oh! Got you, bitch!


208
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.349
What you wanna say?
You gotta say something.


209
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.867
- Really?
- A girl that bad gets mad friend requests.


210
00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:23.991
- Fuck!
- I think it's dinner. Maybe even lunch.


211
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.222
Might have to take this girl
out for coffee.


212
00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.144
- Christ!
- Yeah, this is the long game.


213
00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.827
You're not getting that butt from Barbara
Sugarman anytime in the immediate future.


214
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.505
If you had it like that,
it would have went down.


215
00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.106
You're right.
You're totally right. Shit!


216
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.509
I know, I was about to say, the mighty
Don bringing out the long game?


217
00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.867
- She's a dime, but...
- This girl's more than a dime.


218
00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.547
Come on, son. There's no such thing, that's
the point, it's a scale from one to ten.


219
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.509
- I'm saying, this girl...
- Oh, my God!


220
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:51.745
- You in love with this girl already?
- Go fuck yourself.


221
00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.944
- Hi.
- Can I help you?


222
00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.547
- Yeah, two for lunch.
- Sure. Right this way.


223
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.461
Hey.

224
00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.307
- How are you?
- Good. Good. How you been?


225
00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.748
- How did you get my Facebook?
- Oh. Getting right to it.


226
00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.709
- Yeah.
- I just looked up your name.


227
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.750
- I didn't tell you my name.
- Obviously you did, 'cause I looked it up.


228
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:56.380
- No, I definitely did not tell you my name.
- Yeah, you did.


229
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.384
- I think I would remember.
- No offense, but you were pretty wasted


230
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.747
- the other night. So was I.
- Can I get you some drinks?


231
00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:03.231
- Diet Coke, please.
- A Coke.


232
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.941
Coke and a Diet Coke.
I'll be right back to take your order.


233
00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.390
I had a few drinks the other night,

234
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:12.020
so I may not have remembered
telling you my first name,


235
00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.308
but I definitely did not
tell you my last name.


236
00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:16.349
- I'm telling you... Hey!
- Don't lie to me.


237
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.390
Look, you don't know me, so I'm gonna
let you off the hook this time.


238
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.022
But trust me, in the future you'll be much
happier if you always tell me the truth.


239
00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:25.103
Wait, wait, wait, 
I'll be happier?

240
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.707
You don't think I could make you happy
if I wanted to?


241
00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.704
So how did you find out my name?

242
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.828
- I asked around.
- You asked around about me?


243
00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.824
- Yeah.
- That's interesting.


244
00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.664
- Why?
- Why? What do you mean why?


245
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:41.107
- Why did you ask around about me?
- 'Cause I wanted to.


246
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:42.950
- You wanted to take me to lunch?
- Yeah.


247
00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.626
- Don't lie.
- OK, I asked around about you


248
00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.101
'cause I wanna fuck your brains out.
Is that what you want me to say?


249
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.266
- Well, at least you're being honest now.
- Let me ask you a question.


250
00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.629
Why did you come here, huh?
Why did you say yes to me?


251
00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.589
- That's a very good question.
- Yeah, so?


252
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.344
You're gonna have
to wait to find out.


253
00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.151
- All right. I got time.
- Really? You got time?


254
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.189
It seemed like you were
in a big hurry the other day.


255
00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:06.865
I can be that way
when I'm shit-faced.


256
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:11.191
You're cute, I like you.

257
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.263
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.


258
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:16.901
Listen, you wanna know the truth?

259
00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:19.745
This is the truth.

260
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.824
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen in my life.


261
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.988
You like movies?

262
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.668
<i>I don't watch too many movies.</i>

263
00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:38.684
<i>I used to watch 'em a
lot when I was a little</i>


264
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.172
<i>kid, before I could get
my hands on any porn.</i>


265
00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.375
<i>Back then, if I wanted
to see a really hot</i>


266
00:18:43.401 --> 00:18:45.330
<i>girl, my best bet was
to watch a movie.</i>


267
00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.428
- That's the one you like?
- Oh, it's so great.


268
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.345
- I love these two. And you?
- Yeah. They're great.


269
00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:58.141
<i>But now,
I don't really see the point.</i>


270
00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:05.270
<i>I don't know,
I guess I'm missing something.</i>


271
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.027
<i>Because most people eat that shit up.</i>

272
00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.390
<i>The pretty woman.</i>

273
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:16.421
<i>The pretty man.</i>

274
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.625
<i>Love at first sight.</i>

275
00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:21.066
<i>The first kiss.</i>

276
00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:23.824
- <i>The breakup.</i>
<i>- I felt that!</i>


277
00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.982
<i>- The makeup.
- I'm scared.</i>


278
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:29.781
<i>The expensive wedding,
and they drive off into the sunset.</i>


279
00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:33.945
<i>Everyone knows it's fake, but they
watch it like it's real fucking life.</i>


280
00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.703
She was the most important thing to him.
He gave up everything for her.


281
00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:44.340
It was just meant to be.

282
00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.549
- I love movies like that.
- Yeah, it was great.


283
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:51.989
He's just such a real man.
And she's so beautiful too, always.


284
00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.660
- Her? No, she's too skinny.
- Yeah.


285
00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.630
- What?
- You wanna know who's beautiful?


286
00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.990
- What makes you think you could do that?
- Do what?


287
00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.666
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.</i>


288
00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.426
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>


289
00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:02.543
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>


290
00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.670
<i>- Tell me your sins.
- Since last Sunday I did not have</i>


291
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.107
sexual relations out of wedlock.

292
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.862
I did kiss a girl, this one girl,
out of wedlock, several times,


293
00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:18.231
but it's just kissing. I don't know,
I forget if that counts, so...


294
00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.509
Also, I watched pornographic videos
and masturbated <i>22</i> times.


295
00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.981
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.


296
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.586
- Ten Lord's Prayers and ten Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.


297
00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.311
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,</i>


298
00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.111
and I absolve you from your sins
in the name of the Father, of the Son


299
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.149
- and the Holy Spirit.
- Amen.


300
00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.862
<i>Introducing the
charbroiled, not fried, codfish sandwich,</i>


301
00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.188
<i>only at Carl's Jr. and Hardee's.</i>

302
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:13.625
<i>More than just a piece of meat.</i>

303
00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.670
Oh, go! Jesus.
It's a yellow light! Fuck you!


304
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.583
Our Father...
Who art in heaven...


305
00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.471
...hallowed be Thy name...
Thy Kingdom come...


306
00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:46.224
...Thy will be done...

307
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.541
...on earth...

308
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.261
as it is in heaven...

309
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.544
- No.
- No... What?


310
00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:57.788
- Not out here.
- So let's go inside.


311
00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.941
Mm-mm.

312
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.228
- Why not?
- It's not time for that yet.


313
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:04.111
- You sure?
- Yeah. We barely know each other.


314
00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:09.221
Yeah, we do, pretty much.

315
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:12.390
- I don't know your friends.
- My friends?


316
00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.190
Mmm...

317
00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:17.429
- I wanna meet your friends.
- Those guys are assholes.


318
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:19.070
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


319
00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:21.661
And you don't know my friends.

320
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.550
- Or our families.
- Wait, our families?


321
00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.307
Yeah. I wanna meet your parents
and your sister.


322
00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.861
- Oh, Jesus!
- What? You don't wanna meet my brothers


323
00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:36.070
- and my sister?
- Uh...


324
00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.101
- 'Cause I know they wanna meet you.
- Yeah... I bet they do.


325
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.228
Mmm...

326
00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.624
Mm-hm.

327
00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.781
- Jon.
- Yeah?


328
00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:55.706
- I can't let you come inside just yet.
- No?


329
00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:59.307
No, 'cause I don't know what
that would mean. You know?


330
00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.543
I don't want to do anything
unless it means something.


331
00:24:02.700 --> 00:24:03.701
Uh-huh...

332
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.660
Mm... Don't you think it's always better
when it means something?


333
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.584
- Yeah.
- Mm...


334
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.717
I think you should go
back to school, baby.


335
00:24:12.743 --> 00:24:13.486
What?

336
00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:18.069
- Yeah, come on. Just a night class.
- Oh, my God!


337
00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:20.348
- Just get your degree.
- Oh!


338
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.504
- You would be so sexy with a real job.
- Mm!


339
00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.624
Mm-hm! Yeah...

340
00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:30.466
So, what do you say? You, me and
our friends, we go out sometime?


341
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.942
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah? And our families meet, huh?


342
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.101
- Oh!
- Yeah?


343
00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.705
- Yeah.
- Mm...


344
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.909
And you take one night class for me, baby?
One little class?


345
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:42.108
- Oh! Oh!
- Huh? Yeah? Yeah?


346
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.702
- Yeah! Oh!
- Come on, baby, cum... cum...


347
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:50.024
Mm-hm! Uh-huh.

348
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.346
- Nice.
- Oh, Jesus...


349
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.150
Yeah.

350
00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.941
You're so cute.

351
00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.064
Call me.

352
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.227
- Baby!
- Baby, what?


353
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:54.745
- Baby.
- Baby...


354
00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:57.141
- You guys having a good time?
- You bitch, I don't wanna hear it.


355
00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.382
- Jesus Christ.
- A toast. Let's make a toast.


356
00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.430
Everyone listen up. You get up too.
This is for you. Come on. Get up.


357
00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.741
- Oh, God.
- All right.


358
00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.349
You guys know tonight is me and
this girl's one-month anniversary.


359
00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:11.310
I'm counting that from the first time
I ever saw her, 'cause ever since then,


360
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:15.510
I've felt the same way. She's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.


361
00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.583
- To you, baby.
- No, to us.


362
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.185
To us.

363
00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:21.820
- Mwah. Cheers.
- Cheers!


364
00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.630
God bless.

365
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.181
- So, what's he do?
- He's in school.


366
00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.581
- Oh, the family's got money?
- No, he's got a job.


367
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.787
- Retail?
- No.


368
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:31.941
- Service?
- Yeah.


369
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.068
He's definitely been
spending time at the gym.


370
00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:37.622
- Right? I know. He is so disciplined.
- You guys work out together?


371
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.784
- Mm-mm. No.
- Does he do that muscle guy thing


372
00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.864
where he's, like, looking at himself
while you're doing it?


373
00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.308
- Oh. We haven't done it yet.
- Shit, really?


374
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:51.465
- Oh, my God. That's so amazing!
- All right. I like him.


375
00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:53.827
Goddamn! White shorts.

376
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.187
- Nah.
- What? Come on, that's a dime!


377
00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:02.866
- That's not a dime.
- I'm sorry, but I'd rather do that


378
00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.500
- than do yours.
- You faggot motherfucker!


379
00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:08.709
- I can like any girl I wanna like.
- But she's not hotter than my girl.


380
00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:11.750
- To you, maybe not, but to me...
- Look at that. Sorry, buddy.


381
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.143
- Fuck you, Jonny!
- That's the way...


382
00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:16.825
Hi.

383
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:33.621
Shit!

384
00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.544
So, uh...

385
00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.906
I'm sort of seeing this girl.

386
00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.347
- What did you say?
- What do you mean, what did I say?


387
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.025
- Did you say...?
- She asked you what you said.


388
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.148
What's the matter with that?
I couldn't understand you, either.


389
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.984
Speak up and talk like a human being.

390
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:50.585
- Shush.
- What's your problem?


391
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.101
- Jon. Did you say you found her?
- What?


392
00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.787
- Well, I said I'm sort of...
- Oh, my God! What's her name?


393
00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.910
- Barbara.
- Barbara! Barbara what?


394
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.222
- Here we go...
- Shh! Barbara what?


395
00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.424
- Barbara Sugarman.
- Sugarman?


396
00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:07.662
- She a Jew?
- I don't think so.


397
00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:09.948
- You don't know?
- We haven't really talked...


398
00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:11.909
She's not Italian, we know that.

399
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:13.983
- Sugarman. She black?
- No.


400
00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.670
What does she look like?

401
00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.061
She's the most beautiful thing
I've seen in my life.


402
00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:21.064
- Oh, boy.
- Baby! Oh!


403
00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.427
That's the sweetest thing
I ever heard anybody say.


404
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.789
- And does she love you?
- Wait a minute. Love him? You kidding?


405
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.102
- Jon, shush!
- They're kids, for Christ's sake!


406
00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:31.706
- So what?
- You know what? Don't call me a kid.


407
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.350
We talked about this,
I don't appreciate it.


408
00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.821
- Excuse me.
- Dad, I'm asking you nicely.


409
00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:37.903
To not call you a kid?
You're a fucking kid.


410
00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:39.391
- Jon!
- Fuck You!


411
00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:43.380
- Fuck me? Did you just say fuck me to me?
- Jon!


412
00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.703
He said they're in love, they're in love.
It doesn't matter how old they are.


413
00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:49.784
He's older than you were
when we got married.


414
00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:52.733
You know that?
For God's sake, he's your son!


415
00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.031
You love this girl?

416
00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.790
Yes, I do.

417
00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:03.426
Then when do we get to meet her?

418
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.390
Oh!

419
00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.951
All right, Mom, OK.

420
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.024
oh!

421
00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:15.868
Bella?
Sweetheart, come over here.


422
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:22.341
Come on, let me fix your lipstick.
Here we go.


423
00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.105
- You look so beautiful.
- Thank you.


424
00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:28.309
- Can I get you a refill, Mrs. Sugarman?
- You don't have to do that.


425
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.064
- No, it's my pleasure.
- Jon.


426
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.308
- Thank you.
- Jon, you meet Daryl?


427
00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:34.508
- Oh, wow.
- You wanna hold him?


428
00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.709
- I don't know...
- Come here.


429
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.386
- Here you go, babe.
- OK.


430
00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.625
- All right. Is that good? Is that right?
- Yeah.


431
00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:46.748
You look so cute, the two of you.

432
00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.345
Barbara!

433
00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:00.310
- How long have we been up here for?
- Not long.


434
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:05.182
Well, I gotta go, we gotta go.
Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on.


435
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.864
Close the door.

436
00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:13.421
OK. Let's take a break and when we get
back we'll go over the course syllabus.


437
00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.301
<i>- Hey.
- Baby! How is it?</i>


438
00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.508
- It's great.
- <i>Yeah? You're on break?</i>


439
00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.909
<i>- Yeah. How did you know?
- Your schedule's online.</i>


440
00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.030
<i>- Baby, I'm just so proud of you.
- Thanks.</i>


441
00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.545
- <i>Baby?</i>
- Yeah?


442
00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:45.146
<i>Can I come over when you're done?</i>

443
00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.302
- You wanna come to my place?
- <i>Mm-hm.</i>


444
00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.468
- What, tonight?
- Yeah.


445
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:51.190
OK, great.

446
00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:54.748
- <i>You get back to class, sexy man.</i>
- All right.


447
00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:57.471
<i>- Bye, baby.
- OK, bye.</i>


448
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.305
Jesus fucking Christ!

449
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.951
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.


450
00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.829
It's fine. It's fine.

451
00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:34.702
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.


452
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.024
- It's OK. I'll be right back.
- Baby...


453
00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.347
<i>I'm in love with Barbara. I am.</i>

454
00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.867
<i>And tonight, I finally
got to fuck her.</i>


455
00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:31.429
<i>But I'm sorry to say,
it's still not as good as porn.</i>


456
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:32.820
<i>Tits?</i>

457
00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.108
<i>Best ever.</i>

458
00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.591
<i>Ass?</i>

459
00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.708
<i>Best ever.</i>

460
00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.225
Blow-job?

461
00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:56.621
<i>Shit. Good luck. A girl that hot?
She doesn't have to give head.</i>


462
00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:05.384
<i>For her, she just wants to go from
kissing, to naked kissing, to fucking.</i>


463
00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:09.022
<i>Or, you know, making love.</i>

464
00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:11.865
<i>And when I say
"making love," I mean...</i>


465
00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:14.381
<i>...missionary fucking.</i>

466
00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.111
<i>No doggie.
No cowboy.</i>


467
00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:19.383
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Baby!


468
00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.747
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I was reading e-mails.


469
00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.471
- You weren't. You were watching porno!
- That's not what that was.


470
00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:25.900
- I saw you!
- But, baby...


471
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.108
Don't call me that. Oh, my God!
That's the most disgusting thing


472
00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.786
- I've ever seen in my life!
- Wait, don't go right now, please!


473
00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.863
I don't even know what that is.
That's sick...


474
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.387
- But, baby, I'm telling you...
- Don't call me that!


475
00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.225
But I'm telling you, that thing
I was watching was just a joke!


476
00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.947
Some dumb-ass buddy of mine sent it
to me as a joke. Come on!


477
00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:45.388
You think I'm the kind of guy
that watches porn?


478
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.350
No, you didn't seem like that type.

479
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:51.504
Right. 'Cause fucking losers watch porn,
guys that can't get laid.


480
00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:55.107
Well, no. My friends' boyfriends are
watching porno on the Internet all the time,


481
00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.422
- it's fucking disgusting.
- It's stupid is what that is.


482
00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.823
Why would they watch porn
when they can get with a real girl?


483
00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.109
- So you don't do that normally?
- No.


484
00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:06.308
When was the last time you did that
before this?


485
00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:09.464
I don't even know.
When I was a kid or something.


486
00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:11.549
You're never gonna do it again?

487
00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:15.500
No. Why would I?

488
00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:19.186
- Promise?
- I promise.


489
00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.223
Baby...

490
00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:23.780
I love you.

491
00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:34.348
Come here.

492
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:17.707
<i>It's not that I can't stop.
I just figure, why should I?</i>


493
00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.307
<i>I mean, my girlfriend doesn't like it.
So she doesn't have to know about it.</i>


494
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:25.306
<i>It's not like I'm cheating on her.
I don't do it when she's around.</i>


495
00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:31.351
<i>And everything's fine.</i>

496
00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:39.061
<i>She has been spending a lot of time</i>
<i>at my place, though. So I looked into it.</i>


497
00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:43.464
<i>And it's pretty amazing how easy it is
to get porn on-the-go these days.</i>


498
00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.102
<i>So...</i>

499
00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.460
Excuse me?
Sorry, were you on your phone?


500
00:35:59.486 --> 00:36:00.245
No.

501
00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.542
- I'm Esther.
- Good to meet you.


502
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.702
- What's your name?
- Jon.


503
00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.823
- I hope I'm not bothering you.
- No, it's fine.


504
00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:09.506
I just wanted to apologize.
I don't know if you remember,


505
00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:12.829
you caught me in a kind
of an inopportune moment last week.


506
00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.621
- When I was sobbing by the door?
- Oh! Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry about that.


507
00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:20.182
Please, don't. Please, don't you apologize.
You didn't do anything wrong.


508
00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.184
- I felt like I should say something.
- OK. Well...


509
00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.066
Because I've been thinking about it,
a lot actually, and I realized that,


510
00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:30.981
you know, nobody's seen me
like that in, like, six months,


511
00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.911
- and it's not like it's a rare...
- Good evening, everyone.


512
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.786
...a rare occurrence,
I mean, I do that all the time,


513
00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:42.423
I'm crying all the time. It's just
something that I do in private now.


514
00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.550
On the one hand,
you go there when you go there.


515
00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:48.670
On the other hand, it's really fucked up
to keep it hidden, right?


516
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:51.591
That's what became clear to me
when you startled me.


517
00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:54.386
You didn't, you didn't mean
to startle me, you walked by,


518
00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:57.942
but I just...
so I wanted to say thank you.


519
00:36:58.100 --> 00:37:01.707
Were you... I'm sorry,
this might be rude,


520
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:03.669
but were you watching
people fucking on your phone?


521
00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.710
- What? No!
- It's OK if you were. I'm not judging you.


522
00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.864
- Lady, I'm just here to take this class.
- Did you just call me "lady"?


523
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.705
So you take care.

524
00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.749
Oh, yeah. Sorry. Say no more.

525
00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:22.626
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine.


526
00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.190
What, are you fucking kidding me?!
You're fucking kidding me, right?!


527
00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.944
- Baby!
- What?


528
00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:57.110
I feel like I should leave my jacket
in the car. Maybe not. Should I bring it?


529
00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:59.661
- Yeah, whatever you want.
- Oh...


530
00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.141
- I'm nervous. That's all.
- Why you nervous?


531
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.711
- I don't know...
- You got nothing to be nervous about.


532
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:06.750
You look beautiful.
God, you look beautiful.


533
00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.341
Oh.

534
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.389
- Are you ready? Go ahead.
- Yeah. All right.


535
00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:14.585
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.


536
00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.341
Oh, hello, hello!
You must be Barbara.


537
00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.028
- Hi, Mrs. Martello. Here, for you.
- Thank you, and please call me Angie.


538
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.869
Come in, come in. Jon! Jonny's here!
Come say hello to your son!


539
00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.910
- Please.
- Let me get by you there, babe.


540
00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:36.748
Dad? I would like you to meet Barbara.
Baby, this is my dad.


541
00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:39.665
- Hi, Mr. Martello.
- Hey, good to meet you.


542
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.426
- Jesus Christ!
- Jon!


543
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.868
Oh, I... I wasn't expecting such
a lovely lady, that's all.


544
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.870
Thank you. It's so nice
to finally meet you both.


545
00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.068
My pleasure, my pleasure.

546
00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.542
Well, please sit down
and I will be right back.


547
00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:58.381
- Can I help you with anything at all?
- Oh! I love her already.


548
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:02.147
- Yes, please, sweetie, come on.
- You want me to take that, babe?


549
00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:06.306
- Hey, hey, Jonny-boy!
- She's cute, right?


550
00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.502
Are you fucking kidding me?
You didn't tell me you were bringing home


551
00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:11.903
- a piece of ass like that!
- I told you she was the most beautiful thing


552
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:14.870
- I've ever seen in my life.
- Yeah, you told me, but I mean,


553
00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.863
Jesus Christ, those tits!
They're real?


554
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.627
- Yeah, they're real.
- Oh! Fuck me!


555
00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:24.421
- Did you clear the table?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here, here, honey.


556
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.663
Let me move this here,
so you can put that right there.


557
00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.142
- Right here?
- Right there. That's perfect.


558
00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:37.063
So tell me.
Tell me, how did it go?


559
00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:40.064
I was out with some girlfriends.
We went to see some band.


560
00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:42.188
Back then you used to see bands
when you went out.


561
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.822
- Honey, what band was it?
- You think I remember?


562
00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:49.029
It was 28 years ago,
and I didn't even give a shit then.


563
00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.262
Anyway, I saw him early in the night,

564
00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.430
I don't know if he saw me till later,
but I saw him.


565
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.311
And I saw her, you couldn't miss her.

566
00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:00.464
- She was like you.
- Thank you.


567
00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:02.941
- You know what I said?
- Listen to this.


568
00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:07.782
I said right then,
right when I saw her, I said...


569
00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.550
..."That's mine."

570
00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:13.421
- Oh, God.
- Yup. And he was right.


571
00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.309
Can you... Well, that's beautiful.

572
00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:18.703
- Oh! Big play! Look at that!
- OK, Jon.


573
00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.067
- All right, Dad.
- All right, yeah.


574
00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:24.827
- Good job, big guy.
- Sweetie, so nice to meet you.


575
00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:28.541
- Bye, Mr. Martello.
- Please call me Jon.


576
00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.145
OK, Mom.

577
00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.431
- All right, babe?
- Oh! Bye.


578
00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.581
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.


579
00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.061
- Bye-bye.
- Drive safe.


580
00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:41.787
- I love her! I love her!
- Pretty good, huh? Not bad at all.


581
00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.751
<i>In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.</i>


582
00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.551
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>


583
00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.390
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>


584
00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.581
<i>Tell me your sins.</i>

585
00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:12.268
Since last Sunday, I had sexual
intercourse out of wedlock seven times.


586
00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:15.942
But... I stopped watching porn.

587
00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:20.105
Yeah, no more of that,
just the intercourse now.


588
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.870
So...

589
00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.149
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.


590
00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:28.190
- Five Lord's Prayers and five Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.


591
00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.071
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,</i>


592
00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.791
and I absolve you from your sins
in the name of the Father, of the Son


593
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.028
- and the Holy Spirit.
- Amen.


594
00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:40.743
Very good. OK, when we come back,
we'll go over employee personality testing.


595
00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.982
Go ahead, take a break.

596
00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:49.389
- Hi. Mind if I sit down?
- You know, actually, I...


597
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.184
- I brought you something.
- You what?


598
00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:52.671
- What's that?
- Open it.


599
00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:54.982
- I don't want to take that from you.
- No, no, open it.


600
00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.461
It's something silly.
It's a little thing. Go ahead.


601
00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.304
All right. I'll open it.

602
00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:03.581
- What the fuck is this?
- It's actually pretty good.


603
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.742
- What is the matter with you?
- Have you seen it?


604
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:07.982
- Are you crazy?
- It was made by this Danish woman


605
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:12.981
in the '70s. It's probably not what you're
used to looking at, but it's pretty hot.


606
00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.508
OK. Look, I have a girlfriend, all right?
So...


607
00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:20.790
I'm sorry, did you think I was
hitting on you? Because I'm not.


608
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.066
Will you just take this?

609
00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.030
I didn't mean for it to be a big thing.
I thought you could use something better


610
00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:27.182
than that shit you're
watching on your phone.


611
00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.071
Am I right?

612
00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.190
If you have a girlfriend,
why are you watching dirty movies?


613
00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.820
- What?
- I'm just asking.


614
00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:38.824
- You're fucking weird, you know that?
- I don't entirely disagree,


615
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.630
but you're the one who's gonna
pretend you're texting


616
00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.987
while you watch people pretend
they're fucking on your phone!


617
00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.983
The shit I watch on here,
they're not pretending.


618
00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.586
Of course they are.

619
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.427
Forgive us our trespasses...

620
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:02.141
...as we forgive those...
who trespass against us...


621
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:07.147
...and lead us not...
into temptation...


622
00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.745
...but deliver us from evil...

623
00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:10.470
- Baby?
- Huh?


624
00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.867
What are you doing?
You talking to yourself?


625
00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.020
- Yo, Jonny, you coming out tonight?
- That's dubious.


626
00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.308
I'm gonna wait for Barbara to call.
We're gonna meet up for dinner.


627
00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.901
- This fucking guy. Come on!
- What did you think he was gonna say?


628
00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:23.711
I thought he still had a pair
of balls hanging between his legs.


629
00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:26.784
You sound so fucking stupid to me
right now, I feel sorry for you.


630
00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:28.704
- Fuck you.
- I do. I feel sorry for you.


631
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.431
You never been in love, so you don't
know what you're talking about.


632
00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.628
Hold up. Wait a minute.
In love?


633
00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.226
When you really love a girl,
there's a lot that goes into it.


634
00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:38.223
- You're saying you love her?
- Of course I love her.


635
00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:41.190
- I never heard you say you loved her.
- You weren't paying attention.


636
00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.230
I've been in love with this girl
since the first time I saw her.


637
00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.348
Why would I wanna go out
and try to pull randoms?


638
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.468
None of 'em are gonna
look as good as my girl,


639
00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:50.349
none of 'em are gonna fuck me
as good as my girl.


640
00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.229
- Really?
- Yeah, really.


641
00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:54.621
- So she's good?
- What did I say? Yeah, she's good.


642
00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.669
- She's the best.
- So you titty-fuck her?


643
00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:00.108
Bro, she lets me do
whatever the fuck I want.


644
00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.911
This is what I'm trying to tell you,
if you would listen to me.


645
00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.860
I'm telling you guys something.
You be a man, you do the right thing,


646
00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:10.069
you find the right girl
and you treat her the right way?


647
00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.503
Watch what happens.
Best sex of your life.


648
00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:14.661
Hey, baby.

649
00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:16.584
- Hey.
- Hi.


650
00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:21.102
- I love it when you wear this shit.
- Oh, you're crazy.


651
00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.269
- You good?
- Yeah. You order anything yet?


652
00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:28.821
- No, I waited for you.
- Sweet.


653
00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.268
- Oh, fuck!
- Who's that?


654
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.902
It's Linda.
She's been fighting with Chris.


655
00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.062
I don't think they're gonna work out.

656
00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:42.144
- You remember Linda and Chris, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.


657
00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:45.907
- I thought they were cute together, no?
- Sure. They seemed pretty good.


658
00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.507
She's 28 years old. She put like four
years into the guy already. It's terrible.


659
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:54.229
- How did you get off work tonight?
- I got Stevie to cover my shift.


660
00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:56.747
- Stevie?
- Yeah, he needed the hours.


661
00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.188
- I don't think I know Stevie, no?
- No, I don't think you ever met him.


662
00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:04.061
- Oh! I wish somebody would cover for me.
- See? What did I tell you?


663
00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.222
The service industry,
it's not a bad thing.


664
00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.269
Come on, you're gonna look so good
in a suit.


665
00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.627
- I don't know.
- What? Please.


666
00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.470
If Armando can do it,
that man is such an asshole.


667
00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:19.271
He treats women like they're trash,
but... he makes six figures.


668
00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:22.947
Well, he's got a pretty great life, no?
if he could do it, you could do it.


669
00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:29.027
Hey, baby. You're a winner, right?
You respect people.


670
00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.505
You listen to people.

671
00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.664
- You think so?
- I know so, mister.


672
00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.625
Fucking 'caused it! Fuck!

673
00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.386
Hi, babe.

674
00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.862
I don't know which ones to get.
Baby, what do you think?


675
00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.944
That depends.
You gonna drill into your wall?


676
00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.704
I don't know.

677
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.625
- You don't have a drill, do you?
- No.


678
00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.750
Nah, I didn't think so.
My dad has got a pretty good one.


679
00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:04.267
If you want me,
I can borrow his, I'll do it for you.


680
00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:08.266
- You gonna drill into my wall for me?
- Whatever you want, babe.


681
00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.870
You decide what color.
I'm gonna meet you at the registers.


682
00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.148
I wanna pick up a few things
in cleaning products.


683
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.301
Where are you going?

684
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:19.030
- What?
- Where are you going?


685
00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.182
I'm almost out of Swiffer pads.
I'm gonna pick a few up.


686
00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:22.865
- What pads?
- For the Swiffer.


687
00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:25.626
- I don't know what that is.
- You don't know the Swiffer?


688
00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:27.623
- What is that? No.
- Seriously? It's the best.


689
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:29.669
You gotta try it.
What do you do for your floors?


690
00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:32.187
You got those nice floors at your place.
What, do you mop?


691
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.429
- No.
- What do you do?


692
00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:39.266
- I don't know. I sweep it up with a broom.
- No, I mean to really clean it.


693
00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:42.867
- I don't know. The housekeeper does it.
- Oh, right.


694
00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.506
- Listen, I'll just be a second, OK?
- No, no, no. Come here.


695
00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.743
- What?
- You're not gonna go buy a mop right now.


696
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.307
- It's embarrassing.
- No, I told you, it's not a mop.


697
00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:52.825
- It's these pads.
- I don't care.


698
00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.869
You shouldn't be doing
your own housework.


699
00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.829
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a grown man.


700
00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.348
- You shouldn't be cleaning your own floors.
- Why? I enjoy doing it.


701
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.787
You know what? I'll call Rosa.
She'll do your place.


702
00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.307
- Who?
- Rosa, my cleaning lady, she's great.


703
00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:08.031
Babe, no.
Thanks, but I like doing it myself.


704
00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.342
Are you kidding me?
You don't got to be doing that.


705
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:13.510
She won't do it right anyway.
You gotta vacuum my carpet a certain way,


706
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.822
- or else it looks...
- Don't talk about vacuuming in front of me.


707
00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.665
- Why? What's wrong?
- Why? Because it's not sexy, that's why.


708
00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:20.868
You're not listening to me.
I like my place, OK?


709
00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.465
I'm proud of it,
I like to take care of it.


710
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:25.191
I don't care. We're not having
this discussion right now.


711
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.024
There's only a few things
I really care about...


712
00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:29.581
We're not talking about this anymore.

713
00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:37.661
- Fine, let's drop it.
- Good.


714
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.389
Those ones.

715
00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.069
- You want those?
- Yeah.


716
00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.182
Come here. Listen to me.

717
00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:53.742
When we're living together,
you're not...


718
00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.870
...going to be doing... any cleaning.

719
00:48:58.020 --> 00:48:59.670
Come on.

720
00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:13.307
Jon? Excuse me.

721
00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:16.630
Look, I know you don't
wanna talk to me.


722
00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.709
I would leave you alone,
but I swear to God,


723
00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:20.902
I just fell asleep during
that entire class.


724
00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.382
The whole fucking thing.
Can I copy your notes?


725
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:27.544
I'd ask somebody else, but everyone
in the class are like children.


726
00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:31.864
I'm not calling you old.
It'll take like five minutes...


727
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:34.068
- Do you mind?
- Fine.


728
00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.945
Thank you so much. Do you wanna
go somewhere? There's a cafe...


729
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:40.580
My girlfriend's waiting
at home, so...


730
00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:43.630
Oh. OK, well, then I'll...
OK, I'll do this.


731
00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:56.030
I really shouldn't get so high after
lunch if I'm gonna be coming here later.


732
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.187
You're probably right.

733
00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.389
It is pretty boring,
don't you think?


734
00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:04.985
What?

735
00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:08.109
I said this class is
pretty fucking boring.


736
00:50:08.135 --> 00:50:09.011
Oh. Yep.

737
00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.347
Like they're teaching
you to be a robot.


738
00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:18.029
- Why are you here?
-Hm?


739
00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:21.548
- Why did you pick this class?
- I didn't.


740
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.748
What?

741
00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:27.427
No, it seemed like a good idea.
I'm in the service industry now.


742
00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.867
- You mean you're a waiter?
- No.


743
00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:32.427
- Bartender?
- Yeah, so, if you wanna move up,


744
00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:34.230
- you gotta go to school.
- Right.


745
00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:39.750
But what do you mean you
didn't pick this class?


746
00:50:39.940 --> 00:50:42.830
- No, I did.
- Did somebody pick it for you?


747
00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:45.381
- No!
- Was it your parents or your girlfriend?


748
00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:47.190
- What is it with you? Huh?
- No, I just...


749
00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:49.502
- I was wondering...
- I'm doing something polite...


750
00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:51.987
That's mine.

751
00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.541
OK. Sorry.

752
00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.991
Jesus!

753
00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:05.384
Oh, man! Oh, God!

754
00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:15.021
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Jon.


755
00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:17.103
What's wrong?

756
00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.621
Remember when we first
started dating?


757
00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:24.626
What's the one thing I asked?
I said, "Don't lie to me."


758
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:28.302
- All right, who's talking shit about me?
- Nobody said anything.


759
00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:32.943
- You gotta help me out...
- You looked at 46 porno sites today, Jon.


760
00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.262
- Just today.
- I don't know what you're talking about.


761
00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:37.946
- Don't fucking lie to me!
- I don't know who told you that!


762
00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:40.467
Nobody said anything.
It's right there in your history!


763
00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:43.988
All you do is look at porno.
That's all you fucking do!


764
00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:48.429
- Wait, wait. My what?
- It's in your history.


765
00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:50.821
In your browser?

766
00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:53.586
Come on, don't tell me you don't
know what your history is.


767
00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:56.584
No. Of course you don't, 'cause if
you did, you would have erased it,


768
00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.151
like a good little phony. Here.

769
00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.703
There. Go ahead, look. Go ahead.

770
00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:10.471
- Baby, I...
- Please, no, don't call me that.


771
00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:13.345
- I love you.
- Don't ever say that to me, ever again.


772
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.946
- What do you want me to say?
- What do I want you to say?


773
00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.741
How about, "I'm sorry I've been
lying to you since the first day


774
00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.231
that we started dating"?
How about that?


775
00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:24.902
- I'm sorry. I am.
- How about, "I'm sorry I have more sex


776
00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:26.664
with that thing
than I do with my girlfriend"?


777
00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:30.222
First of all, everybody
watches porn, OK? All guys.


778
00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.428
Any guy tells you he doesn't
is lying to you.


779
00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:34.230
- You are so full of shit!
- Second of all...


780
00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:37.827
- You are full of shit!
- Second of all, you know damn well


781
00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:40.102
- we do it all the fucking time!
- Yeah, I know we do.


782
00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.627
- Whenever you want!
- So what the fuck is wrong with you?


783
00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.260
What the fuck are you doing?
How do you watch that shit?


784
00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:47.548
I don't know! OK?
I don't know!


785
00:52:47.740 --> 00:52:50.471
How do you watch all the stupid
fucking movies you watch?


786
00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:52.224
How do I watch movies?
What are you talking about?


787
00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:54.986
I'm saying, you probably watch
that shit as much as I watch porn.


788
00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.824
What are you saying?
That has nothing to do with anything!


789
00:52:56.980 --> 00:53:00.746
- I'm just saying...
- Jon, movies and porno are different!


790
00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:03.585
- They give awards for movies!
- They give awards for porn too.


791
00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.981
Shut up!
Shut the fuck up!


792
00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.228
I can't believe we're
talking about this.


793
00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.382
I'm sorry. Jesus.
Look, stop it.


794
00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:18.225
I don't know,
I don't know what's wrong with me.


795
00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:30.825
I'm sorry, OK? I... I'm sorry.
I am so sorry...


796
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:38.706
I really liked you, you know?

797
00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:49.303
I thought you were different.

798
00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:51.224
But you're not.

799
00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.388
<i>So up until now,
my record was ten in one day.</i>


800
00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:21.545
<i>And for a long time, I thought I'd
never beat that. But today...</i>


801
00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:24.510
<i>- ...I hit 11.</i>

802
00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:30.062
<i>And you know, when I have great
fucking days like this,</i>


803
00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:34.748
<i>it just reminds me how much
I love being single.</i>


804
00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.551
<i>
- I do what I want, when I want.</i>

805
00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:39.941
<i>I don't have to flake
on my friends anymore.</i>


806
00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.151
<i>I don't have to waste my time
in a fucking classroom.</i>


807
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:48.305
<i>It just feels good, like...
like I got my own life back.</i>


808
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.509
<i>I mean, you think I could have hit 11 when</i>
<i>I was with Barbara? No! Definitely not.</i>


809
00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:59.101
<i>So...</i>

810
00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.902
- Jonny-boy!
- Jesus, bro, I can smell it on you already.


811
00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.626
- You got to catch up, baby!
- You mean I got to buy your poor ass


812
00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:25.465
- a fucking drink?
- Yo, the Don mad anxious tonight.


813
00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:27.190
- Fuck you!
- Where's wife?


814
00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.946
- Fuck that bitch.
- Oh, shit!


815
00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.511
- Damn, OK!
- All right.


816
00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:35.949
You can't have this one, 'cause I
saw her first, but check out pink.


817
00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:38.990
Yeah. She's all right.

818
00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.866
- Hey, fuck you, buddy!
- Fuck you!


819
00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:04.503
What'd you say? Huh?
What the fuck did you just say?! Hey!


820
00:56:04.660 --> 00:56:07.391
You wanna say some shit? Let's hear it,
you fat fuck! What did you say?!


821
00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:12.262
- I said fuck you!
- Fuck me, huh? Fuck me?


822
00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:16.550
Is that what you said?!
Huh? Huh? You fuck! Ah!


823
00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:20.187
Fuck! Goddamn it! Fuck!

824
00:56:35.660 --> 00:56:37.867
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>


825
00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.751
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>


826
00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:42.345
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>


827
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:44.423
- Jonny, where were you?
- Don't worry about it.


828
00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:45.911
- What did you do to your...?
- Mom, it's fine.


829
00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.910
- Shh!
- Hey, hush yourself!


830
00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:51.546
Mom! It's fine.
OK?


831
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.940
<i>Tell me your sins.</i>

832
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:56.786
Father, I don't know
what happened, but...


833
00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:59.750
...I guess I lost my temper and I...

834
00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:02.824
I punched through this guy's window
on my way here right now.


835
00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:05.108
I didn't hurt anybody, but...

836
00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:08.711
Yeah, I don't know
what's wrong with me.


837
00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:14.227
Also, I watched pornographic videos
and masturbated 35 times.


838
00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:17.788
For these and all the sins
of my life, I'm sorry.


839
00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:21.467
- Twenty Lord's Prayers and 25 Hail Marys.
- Thank you, Father.


840
00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.590
<i>Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace.</i>


841
00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:28.187
<i>I absolve you from your sins in the name of
the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.</i>


842
00:57:28.340 --> 00:57:29.705
Amen.

843
00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:34.149
- So Barbara couldn't come tonight?
- No, she had this family thing tonight.


844
00:57:34.300 --> 00:57:36.382
But she wanted to make it,
she just couldn't.


845
00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:39.544
- She told me to say hello to you guys.
- That's sweet.


846
00:57:39.740 --> 00:57:41.390
Everything good with
the two of you?


847
00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:47.029
- Yeah, she's great.
- She's a catch, Jonny.


848
00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.786
Beautiful girl.

849
00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:54.104
I'm telling you,
a woman like that make a boy into a man.


850
00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:56.501
I can see it on you too,
it's starting.


851
00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:10.342
Holy Mary...

852
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:12.865
...Mother of God...

853
00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.303
...pray for us sinners...

854
00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:19.865
...now...

855
00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:22.984
...and at the hour of our death.

856
00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:26.950
Amen.

857
00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.784
What the fuck?

858
00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.387
- The fuck you doing here?
- Damn, really?


859
00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:03.111
- Bro, I'm busy.
- Word, what you doing?


860
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:08.180
Right. Just 'cause you don't pick up
your phone don't make you busy.


861
00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:14.343
- You smashed up somebody's car?
- Who told you that?


862
00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:18.864
Kerry's sister said she heard you broke
through some guy's window.


863
00:59:19.020 --> 00:59:21.068
- Well, did you?
- The guy was a fucking asshole.


864
00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:22.665
- What did he do?
- Why you taking his side?


865
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:24.345
- I'm not taking his side.
- You are.


866
00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:27.629
Stop and think for a second.
Stop and think for a second.


867
00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:30.863
I don't care about that guy, I don't
give a damn about his car. Fuck him.


868
00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.909
What do you think
I'm doing here, man?


869
00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.503
- You wanna have a seat?
- Bro, honestly...


870
00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:37.742
Man, sit your ass down.

871
00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.951
- All right, what happened with your girl?
- Fuck that bitch.


872
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.467
- You said that already. What, she drop you?
- No.


873
00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.345
No? You drop her?
After all that, she cheat on you?


874
00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:54.150
- No!
- So, what happened?


875
00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:57.747
Nothing! It's so fucking stupid.
That's what I'm saying, she's a bitch.


876
00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:00.471
She did drop your ass.
What did you do, man? You cheat on her?


877
01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.906
No!

878
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:05.826
All right, you wanna hear this shit?
It's so fucking retarded.


879
01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.301
She caught me
watching porn.


880
01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.667
- That's it?
- Right?


881
01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:12.822
- That's bullshit.
- Swear to God.


882
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:17.269
Oh, my God! OK, hold on,
hold on, all right.


883
01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.869
So after all that obligatory shit,
the friend mixing and meeting her folks,


884
01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:25.229
she just walks in on you, you know,
beating your meat to a little video


885
01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.984
- and she's out?
- You don't know her.


886
01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:30.144
- She's crazy, she's a princess.
- Goddamn!


887
01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.029
- I know.
- No, for real,


888
01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:33.750
that's some crazy bullshit
right there.


889
01:00:33.900 --> 01:00:37.700
- Fuck that bitch.
- Yeah. Fuck that bitch.


890
01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:43.028
But you still gonna
finish that class?


891
01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.148
- Really?
- What are you, my mom?


892
01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:48.025
No, I just thought it was almost done.
How much longer you got?


893
01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:52.185
All right, everyone,
three more weeks until the final.


894
01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:56.664
If you have any questions or concerns, please
feel free to e-mail me. Have a good night.


895
01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:17.831
- Hey.
- Hi.


896
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:22.022
- Where you going?
- To my car.


897
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:27.702
- Oh, shit!
- OK.


898
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:30.670
No, we're fine,
we're fine, we're fine.


899
01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.388
Oh, my God!

900
01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:47.070
Should've smoked this before,
you might've relaxed a little.


901
01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.109
What's that supposed to mean?

902
01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:54.345
I'm playing with you. Trust me,
I'm a perfectly satisfied customer.


903
01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:57.663
- You want some?
- Thanks.


904
01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.744
So I'm parked all the way on the other side.
I don't know if you want...


905
01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:08.541
I know, you wanna get back, so let me enjoy
this and I'll drive you back to your car.


906
01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:10.429
OK.

907
01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:16.706
- So, what happened with your girlfriend?
- Fuck that bitch.


908
01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:20.262
- That bad? She find somebody else?
- No.


909
01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:22.343
Wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.


910
01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:27.183
She snooped around on my computer,
she found out I watch porn.


911
01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:30.150
I told her every fucking guy watches
porn, she didn't believe me.


912
01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:34.385
She acted like I was cheating on her
or something, which I wasn't.


913
01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.907
So... we broke up.

914
01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.506
And you know what?
I'm glad we did.


915
01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:43.348
- Just porn?
- Yeah.


916
01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:46.430
- No, I don't buy it.
- I'm telling you. That's all.


917
01:02:46.580 --> 01:02:49.982
Was it just once?
Oh.


918
01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:54.429
OK. So she caught you once, which is why
you're watching it on your phone at school,


919
01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:57.231
'cause you're hiding it from her,
but she caught you the second time.


920
01:02:57.380 --> 01:03:00.350
I don't know.
Am I right? I'm just guessing, but...


921
01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:04.987
Oh, God, you're like a junkie.
You can't stop.


922
01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.901
- How often do you watch it?
- What the fuck do you care?


923
01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:14.544
- No, like every day?
- Every guy watches porn every day.


924
01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:18.665
All right. When was the last time
you went a day without it?


925
01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:20.629
- I don't know.
- No, come on, try and think.


926
01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:23.351
- Seriously, I have no idea.
- Like this week, like this month?


927
01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:27.340
No. I like my porn, OK?
I watch it every day. I always have.


928
01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:31.101
Maybe when I was a kid, like before
I had a VCR in my room and I couldn't,


929
01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:34.343
but even then I had Playboys, so...

930
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.980
- Have you ever thought about quitting?
- Quit...?


931
01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:40.104
You're talking about it like...
No, why would I?


932
01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:42.706
OK, let me ask you this.

933
01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:46.023
You're a good-looking guy, I'm sure you
attract a lot of young ladies.


934
01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.501
Why bother with porn
when you can have the real thing?


935
01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.947
Nah, see, it's not the same thing.

936
01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:54.104
I mean, real pussy's all good,
but, no offense...


937
01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:59.027
No, no, no offense taken.
So you like porn better than sex?


938
01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:04.948
Well, what is it?
What do you get from porn


939
01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:07.785
that you don't get from sex
with an actual person?


940
01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:12.271
- I lose myself.
- You lose yourself.


941
01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:15.748
Yeah, just... goodbye.

942
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:19.427
- And that doesn't happen when you have sex.
- I wish it did.


943
01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:23.630
Sure, don't we all? Um...

944
01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:27.466
OK. One more question,
then I'll drive you back.


945
01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:31.261
- You ever jerk off without porn?
- What do you mean?


946
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.582
<i>I'm not like a junkie.
Come on, that's stupid.</i>


947
01:04:57.740 --> 01:05:00.471
<i>It's porn, it's not fucking heroin.</i>

948
01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:05.706
<i>I knew a few guys in high school who
actually smoked crack, like all the time.</i>


949
01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:11.026
<i>That's like a junkie. They couldn't stop.
I could stop if I wanted to. I could.</i>


950
01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:09.185
- Hi.
- Hey.


951
01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:12.901
- Somebody's excited.
- Yeah. Come on.


952
01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:16.701
- I wanted to talk to you.
- Yeah? What about?


953
01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:19.790
Don't you wanna...?

954
01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:23.945
Don't you wanna wait
till after class?


955
01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:26.830
OK.

956
01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.511
All right.

957
01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.387
You're... You're intense today.
What's going on with you?


958
01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.060
- I gotta talk to you.
- I didn't think you meant that


959
01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.109
- when you said it.
- Well, I did.


960
01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.821
Well, I'm flattered.
What do you wanna talk about?


961
01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.665
Um...

962
01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:04.424
So you were right.

963
01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:06.230
- About what, your girlfriend?
- No.


964
01:07:06.380 --> 01:07:09.145
I'm sorry.
I was right about what?


965
01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.031
- I stopped watching porn.
- Oh, yeah? That's great!


966
01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.545
- I don't know if it is.
- No, it is.


967
01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:18.024
I wasn't gonna stop, but then I was
thinking about what you asked me before,


968
01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:23.107
¡f 1 ever jerk off without watching porn,
and 1 tried to...


969
01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:26.901
- Yeah? And you couldn't?
- No, I couldn't.


970
01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:30.223
I don't know what's wrong with me. I've been
trying for a week, it's really fucked up.


971
01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:36.308
- Oh, my God! You haven't cum in a week?
- Mm...


972
01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:41.151
OK, wait. No. I want to hear
the rest of the story.


973
01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:46.508
- So you haven't watched porn in a week.
- Yeah.


974
01:07:46.660 --> 01:07:48.389
- That's good.
- What do you mean?


975
01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.190
You said you watched porn.

976
01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:53.822
Uh, yeah, but that movie
that I gave you was totally...


977
01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:55.510
- Did you ever watch it?
- No.


978
01:07:55.660 --> 01:07:58.789
OK. It's totally unlike the stuff
that I imagine you watch every day.


979
01:07:58.980 --> 01:08:01.426
- That is not healthy.
- What do you mean? How do you know?


980
01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:04.629
Oh, my God, please!
That stuff is ridiculous


981
01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:08.905
and it's nothing to do with actual sex.
That's why you have trouble with real women.


982
01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.951
- No, I get off fine with real girls.
- Yeah, you definitely do.


983
01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:16.263
Yeah, I just couldn't get off
beating it with my eyes closed.


984
01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:21.460
But didn't you tell me last week
that you like porn better than real sex?


985
01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:26.505
Well, honey, I'm gonna be honest with you,
'cause it seems like that's what you want.


986
01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:30.107
Look, the way you have sex,
it's like totally one-sided.


987
01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.951
It's like I'm not even there.

988
01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:36.587
I mean, look, it's fine with me.
I'm not complaining.


989
01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:39.346
It just so happens that meaningless sex
is something that I want in my life now,


990
01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:43.027
but you said that you
wanna lose yourself in sex.


991
01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:47.310
If you wanna lose yourself, you have
to lose yourself in another person.


992
01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:51.909
And she has to lose herself in you.
It's a two-way thing.


993
01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:00.628
You know what?
I shouldn't have said that.


994
01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:03.067
- No, it's fine.
- No, no, no. I'm sorry. I am.


995
01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:06.986
- What are you talking about?
- No. I'm really sorry.


996
01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:09.586
I'm... I didn't mean to
hurt your feelings.


997
01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:12.550
- You didn't. That's fine.
- No, I really didn't.


998
01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:16.863
You know what?

999
01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:19.588
Let's take a bath.

1000
01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:23.461
- What? Nah!
- No, come on. It'll be nice.


1001
01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:26.544
Come on, let's take a bath.

1002
01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.662
I'm gonna get you a towel.

1003
01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:45.187
Hey, where were you?

1004
01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:47.627
I used one of the towels that was
in there, hope you don't mind.


1005
01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:49.669
Yeah, that's fine.

1006
01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:53.182
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.


1007
01:10:55.740 --> 01:11:01.144
- You don't live here alone, do you?
- I actually do.


1008
01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:07.023
There's some kind of...
bad marriage situation here?


1009
01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:09.182
- No.
- I know it's none of my business, sorry.


1010
01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:13.305
I don't wanna get caught out and now some
guy's coming at me with a bat or some shit.


1011
01:11:13.460 --> 01:11:15.701
No, it's nothing like that.

1012
01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:19.504
All right. So, what is it?

1013
01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:22.391
Since when do you ask
me personal questions?


1014
01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.266
Since right now.

1015
01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:30.103
- It really doesn't matter.
- Well, it seems like it matters to you.


1016
01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:32.228
No, it doesn't.

1017
01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:36.829
Didn't you tell me it's sort of fucked up
to keep stuff like this hidden?


1018
01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:47.867
My husband and my son
died 14 months ago.


1019
01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:49.306
- Jesus!
- Thank you.


1020
01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.025
What happened?

1021
01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.150
Cars are terrible things.

1022
01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.464
I'm sorry, but your hair
is so much better this way.


1023
01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:01.191
- What?
- I can touch it.


1024
01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:05.265
- What are you talking about?
- You put so much junk in your hair,


1025
01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:08.390
it's all sticky and hard,
this is much better.


1026
01:14:29.060 --> 01:14:32.109
<i>♪ Good vibration</i>

1027
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:35.867
<i>♪ It's such a sweet sensation</i>

1028
01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:39.422

1029

1030
01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.145

1031
01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:06.221
<i>In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.</i>


1032
01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:09.224
<i>- Amen. Bless you, my son.
- Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.</i>


1033
01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:10.950
<i>It has been one week
since my last confession.</i>


1034
01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:14.582
<i>- Tell me your sins.</i>
- First of all, I lied to you before.


1035
01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.151
I told you that, uh...

1036
01:15:16.300 --> 01:15:19.270
Well, actually,
I don't know if it was you.


1037
01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:23.021
Something I've always kinda wondered is, is
it the same guy I'm talking to every week


1038
01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:27.868
or there's a few of you and you
switch off, or... how does that all work?


1039
01:15:30.620 --> 01:15:34.591
Well, anyway,
I told the Father a while back


1040
01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:40.668
that I stopped watching pornography,
but that was a lie, I didn't stop at all.


1041
01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:45.343
The thing is, this week I actually did stop,
like totally just not doing it anymore.


1042
01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.502
So...

1043
01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:52.622
- Yes?
- Yeah, so that's like zero for the week.


1044
01:15:52.780 --> 01:15:56.830
Other than that, I did have
sex out of wedlock one time,


1045
01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:02.020
but it was different,
it wasn't just sex, it was like...


1046
01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:07.266
I don't know, it's hard to explain,
but... yeah, that's it. So...


1047
01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:11.345
For these and all the sins
of my life, I am sorry.


1048
01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.346
- Ten Lord's Prayers and ten Hail Marys.
- Really? Same thing, no difference?


1049
01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.741
<i>Through the ministry
of the Church, may God give you...</i>


1050
01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.227
Wait! Father, I'm really sorry,

1051
01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:23.748
but could you just tell me how
you got to those numbers, please?


1052
01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:28.423
'Cause I... I really thought there
was gonna be a difference this week.


1053
01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.747
Have faith, my son.

1054
01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:37.471
Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace,


1055
01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:42.228
and I absolve you from your sins in the name
of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.


1056
01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:51.661
- So, uh... me and Barbara split up.
- What?


1057
01:16:51.820 --> 01:16:56.747
- Barbara and I split up.
- I can't believe it, this is horrible!


1058
01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:58.664
- Can you get her back?
- I don't think so.


1059
01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:01.266
- Did you try to call her?
- She doesn't want me to call her.


1060
01:17:01.420 --> 01:17:03.661
- Look what you did.
- Sorry. What do you want me to do?


1061
01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:07.581
I just want you to be happy,
that's all! Is that too much to ask?


1062
01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:11.785
- I wasn't happy.
- A nice wife and some nice kids?


1063
01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:14.466
Look at me!
I look like a grandmother,


1064
01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:17.061
but do I have any grandchildren? No!

1065
01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:19.222
Am I a bad mother,
is that what I'm hearing?


1066
01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:21.986
- Honey, calm down, please!
- You know, Ma, I don't know


1067
01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:26.589
- if I really want a wife and kids.
- What are you saying? You don't mean that.


1068
01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:28.504
- Jon, say something!
- All right!


1069
01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.425
Stop upsetting your mother!
What the fuck is the matter with you?


1070
01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.867
- I don't know.
- Having a family is the greatest joy


1071
01:17:34.020 --> 01:17:36.944
- in a man's life, everybody knows that!
- Then maybe I'm not a man.


1072
01:17:37.140 --> 01:17:41.464
'Cause I sure don't want a family.
Maybe one day, but not right now!


1073
01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:44.305
- Well, and that's all she wanted.
- What did she say?


1074
01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:48.670
- I said that that girl...
- I cannot hear any fucking thing!


1075
01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:54.944
- What are you saying?
- All I'm saying is, that girl,


1076
01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:57.102
she has her own agenda.
She doesn't care about Jonny,


1077
01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.910
she doesn't know
the first thing about him.


1078
01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.030
She just wants a guy who's
gonna do whatever she tells him to.


1079
01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.308
It is a good thing
that she broke up with you.


1080
01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:09.507
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.


1081
01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:22.030
- Jon, I will fucking kill you!
- All right. Easy.


1082
01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:11.143
All right, listen, listen, I gotta go,
so I'll see you later? All right. Bye.


1083
01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.950
- Sorry.
- That's cool.


1084
01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:15.751
- Sorry about that.
- No problem. How you doing?


1085
01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:18.506
- A little windy.
- Yeah, it's windy out here.


1086
01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.624
- So... I'm good. How are you?
- Good, thanks.


1087
01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:24.226
- Everybody good?
- Yeah, great.


1088
01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:28.546
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure.


1089
01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.146
Hope you understand why I thought lunch
was not a good idea.


1090
01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:34.867
- That's fine. You want some coffee?
- No, actually I gotta go pretty soon, so...


1091
01:19:38.460 --> 01:19:43.307
- You changed your hair?
- Yeah...


1092
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:49.182
- So?
- Yeah, so...


1093
01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.382
I just wanted to apologize.

1094
01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:57.309
I lied to you, and
I'm sorry for that.


1095
01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.626
Well, that's all you're gonna say?

1096
01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:11.348
I don't really know what I do with that.
What do I say?


1097
01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:14.185
I forgive you, or we're supposed
to get back together or something?


1098
01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.385
- No. No, I just wanted to tell you...
- You're not capable of a relationship, Jon.


1099
01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:22.261
- You're not.
- No. Right now I'm not.


1100
01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:25.185
'Cause you're a selfish person,
and you're a liar.


1101
01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:29.231
- Yeah, I was. I'm sorry.
- I asked you to do one thing for me...


1102
01:20:29.380 --> 01:20:33.430
Yeah. I was thinking about that
when you said it before.


1103
01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:37.027
Well, I said it because it's true,
that's why.


1104
01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:43.026
- It's not true.
- Really?


1105
01:20:43.180 --> 01:20:46.150
You didn't only ask me for one thing.
You asked for a lot,


1106
01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:48.667
a lot of different things and then...

1107
01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:51.065
...I couldn't do it all for you.

1108
01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:55.544
Well, when a real man loves a woman,
he doesn't mind doing things for her.


1109
01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:58.226
He'll do anything for her.

1110
01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:03.511
Yeah, but don't you think that
sounds a little bit one-sided?


1111
01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:06.061
No, I don't.

1112
01:21:06.220 --> 01:21:09.781
But that's why you like to watch
those whores in those videos,


1113
01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:12.221
because you don't gotta
do anything for them, right?


1114
01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:17.261
Yeah, that's one-sided also.
Definitely.


1115
01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:22.746
Look, sweetie, I'm gonna go, OK?

1116
01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:27.908
Don't call me anymore.

1117
01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:38.827
The streak is over, motherfucker!
How's it feel?


1118
01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:42.223
- I'd rather get pizza with my boys.
- That's new.


1119
01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:46.146
Every fucking time we go out,
Don Jon smashes!


1120
01:21:46.300 --> 01:21:48.223
But not tonight,
ladies and gentlemen.


1121
01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:51.463
The fans are devastated.
Jonny, what happened?


1122
01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:53.941
Yeah! Well, I thought it was on
with old crop top.


1123
01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:56.262
- No, that girl was annoying.
- She was tight though.


1124
01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:57.626
- Eight.
- Solid eight.


1125
01:21:57.820 --> 01:22:00.266
Her body was at least an eight,
but you didn't talk to her.


1126
01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:02.946
- Who cares how she talks?
- You asked why I didn't smash,


1127
01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:07.071
that's why I didn't smash. What about you?
You were kicking it to pony-tail, right?


1128
01:22:07.220 --> 01:22:10.110
- How did it go?
- You get her name?


1129
01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.104
- I got a number.
- Oh! Hey!


1130
01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:15.183
- You like that?
- Fucking right I do!


1131
01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:19.783
- Easy, easy. Did you get her name?
- Yeah!


1132
01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:21.146
Wait...

1133
01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:25.065
- Oh, fuck!
- What?


1134
01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:26.705
I saved it as pony-tail.

1135
01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.306
- Danny-boy!
- Danny-boy!


1136
01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:32.828
All right, all right, all right.
Take it easy, take it easy.


1137
01:22:45.260 --> 01:22:46.944
<i>This fucking lady.</i>

1138
01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:51.150
<i>I don't usually like it when a girl
looks me right in the eye,</i>


1139
01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:53.109
<i>and this girl does that a lot.</i>

1140
01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:57.549
<i>But I don't know what it is about her.
When she does it, I don't mind.</i>


1141
01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:02.024
<i>I just look right back at her,
and pretty soon...</i>


1142
01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:04.421
<i>...I'm hard as a fucking rock.</i>

1143
01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:06.981
<i>It's like she knows
what I'm thinking.</i>


1144
01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:09.911
<i>Or I know what she's thinking, or...</i>

1145
01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:14.025
<i>I don't know, it's that two-way thing.
I fucking love it.</i>


1146
01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:21.065
<i>And I don't mean love like,
"I love her, I wanna marry her."</i>


1147
01:23:21.220 --> 01:23:23.905
<i>I'm definitely not thinking
about all that shit.</i>


1148
01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:26.461
<i>And she's not either.</i>

1149
01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:29.902
<i>She can't.</i>

1150
01:23:33.540 --> 01:23:36.510
<i>I guess I just mean love like,</i>

1151
01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:40.870
<i>you know, like when
we're making love.</i>


1152
01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:45.910
<i>And while we're doing it,
all the bullshit does fade away,</i>


1153
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:49.143
<i>and it's just me and her,
right there,</i>


1154
01:23:49.300 --> 01:23:52.782
<i>and yeah, I do lose myself in her,</i>

1155
01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:56.342
<i>and I can tell she is
losing herself in me,</i>


1156
01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:01.666
<i>and we're just fucking...
lost together.</i>
