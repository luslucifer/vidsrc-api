<i>â€¦advances in science and technology.</i>


2
00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:46.751
<i>Opportunities and jobs will multiply
as we cross new thresholds of knowledge</i>


3
00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:49.045
<i>and reach deeper into the unknown.</i>

4
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.509
<i>Nowhere is this more important
than our next frontier, space.</i>


5
00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:58.763
Tonight, I am directing NASA to develop
a permanently manned space station,


6
00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:00.974
and to do it within a decade.

10
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.925
[girl] <i>I think I put, like,</i>
<i>a bell in there</i>


11
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.886
<i>that was like, "Number One Dad."</i>

12
00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:42.140
<i>- Got the bell and the card too, yeah.</i>
- [girl] <i>Yeah.</i>


13
00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:44.225
[man] <i>The T-shirt was in there too.</i>

<i>Mr. Secretary General,</i>

ladies and gentlemen,</i>


19

<i>we meet again in the quest for peace.</i>

20
00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:46.139
[man] <i>President Kennedy made a speech</i>
<i>to the United Nations in September of 1963</i>


21
00:03:46.597 --> 00:03:49.267
and made the offer
to bring the Soviet Union in


22
00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:52.103
and to make them
a part of the Apollo program.


23
00:03:53.313 --> 00:03:54.731
[JF Kennedy] <i>Finally, in a field</i>

24
00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:57.900
<i>where the United States
and the Soviet Union</i>


25
00:03:58.026 --> 00:04:02.155
<i>have a special capacity
in the field of space,</i>


26
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.033
<i>there is room for new cooperation,</i>

27
00:04:05.158 --> 00:04:07.201
<i>for further joint efforts</i>

28
00:04:07.285 --> 00:04:10.580
<i>in the regulation
and exploration of space.</i>


29
00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:16.502
<i>I include among these possibilities
a joint expedition to the Moon.</i>


30
00:04:17.128 --> 00:04:20.173
<i>Space offers no problems of sovereignty.</i>

31
00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:24.010
<i>Why, therefore,
should man's first flight to the Moon</i>


32
00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:26.846
<i>be a matter of national competition?</i>

33
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:30.183
November of that year,
he wrote a memo to NASA


34
00:04:30.308 --> 00:04:33.186
<i>telling them he would like to have them
come back in two weeks</i>


35
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:38.399
<i>and tell them why the Soviet Union
should not be a part of Apollo.</i>


36
00:04:44.864 --> 00:04:49.035
<i>President Kennedy was killed
on the 22nd of November,</i>


37
00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:50.620
<i>and that never happened.</i>

38
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.792
<i>That vision that Kennedy had
of working together as partners</i>


39
00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:59.629
finally materialized
and is happening today.


40
00:04:59.754 --> 00:05:02.757
<i>That is the space station
we're flying right now.</i>


41
00:05:14.977 --> 00:05:17.814
[man] <i>There has never been any other</i>
<i>collaborative engineering project</i>


42
00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:20.983
<i>of this scope, size or challenge,
in my opinion.</i>


43
00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.071
<i>You are basically taking
pieces of hardware</i>


44
00:05:25.196 --> 00:05:27.865
<i>that may have been built
thousands of miles apart,</i>


45
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.285
<i>that had never been in the same room,
never touched each other.</i>


46
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.331
<i>Then you have to put them together
in space, in a vacuum,</i>


47
00:05:35.456 --> 00:05:37.375
<i>going at 18,000 miles an hour,</i>

48
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.460
<i>and they have to work
the first time they touch</i>


49
00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:42.964
<i>and not cause shocks or not leak
or have any other problems</i>


50
00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.633
<i>that of course are disastrous in space.</i>

51
00:05:45.758 --> 00:05:48.886
And they all worked. They all worked
when we put them together.


52
00:06:16.122 --> 00:06:17.498
<i>I flew three times in space.</i>

53
00:06:17.623 --> 00:06:21.377
<i>My third mission was as the commander
of the International Space Station</i>


54
00:06:21.502 --> 00:06:23.963
<i>early in its assembly in life.</i>

55
00:06:24.088 --> 00:06:27.216
<i>I was trained
for several possible spacewalks.</i>


56
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:30.636
I ended up doing one
where we were attaching the cables


57
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:33.598
to power up a new compartment
that had come up


58
00:06:33.723 --> 00:06:37.101
and test out a new piece of equipment
that the Russians had sent up there.


59
00:06:41.898 --> 00:06:43.733
<i>It's an all-day affair
to get ready for it.</i>


60
00:06:43.816 --> 00:06:45.484
<i>You have to have all the right equipment,</i>

61
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.029
<i>we have to prepare the station
as if we can't get back inside</i>


62
00:06:48.154 --> 00:06:49.614
<i>and have to come in a different way,</i>

63
00:06:49.697 --> 00:06:51.866
<i>and then you've got to go through
all the procedures</i>


64
00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.036
<i>to make sure your suit is working right
before you go outside.</i>


65
00:06:57.163 --> 00:07:00.416
It's a whole different experience
being on the outside of the station.


66
00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:03.169
We're here in Washington
and the Washington Monument's downtown.


67
00:07:03.294 --> 00:07:04.879
If you could imagine someone asks you

68
00:07:04.962 --> 00:07:09.050
to go out the windows at the top
of the monument and wash the outside.


69
00:07:09.175 --> 00:07:10.885
You open the window, you look out.

70
00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:13.137
There's nothing for 500 feet below you.

71
00:07:13.262 --> 00:07:16.307
So you open the hatch on the station.
You look out.


72
00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:20.353
<i>There's nothing except the atmosphere
for 250 miles below you.</i>


73
00:07:25.316 --> 00:07:28.986
<i>You'd be very careful about making sure
your tethers were always attached,</i>


74
00:07:29.111 --> 00:07:32.240
<i>because the Russian suit did not have
a little rocket pack on the back</i>


75
00:07:32.323 --> 00:07:34.200
<i>to fly you back if you got loose.</i>

76
00:07:41.624 --> 00:07:45.086
<i>About an hour or so in,
when I was feeling pretty comfortable,</i>


77
00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:47.296
I found myself on top of the station,

78
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:49.799
and so I put
my feet under the hand-holds

79
00:07:49.924 --> 00:07:52.718
and I stood up
on top of the station.

80
00:07:52.843 --> 00:07:56.847
Imagine standing on top of a 747
and holding on to just a little rope.


81
00:07:56.973 --> 00:07:58.891
That's what it was like standing up there,

82
00:07:59.016 --> 00:08:00.768
because you had the fuselage
of the station,


83
00:08:00.893 --> 00:08:02.687
you had the wings of the solar arrays,

84
00:08:02.812 --> 00:08:06.566
and you're on top of the world,
and it's all just unrolling beneath you.


85

[applause]

86
00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:29.839
Throughout all history, humankind
has had only one place to call home,


87
00:08:29.964 --> 00:08:31.591
our planet Earth.

88
00:08:31.716 --> 00:08:33.759
Beginning this year, 1998,

89
00:08:33.884 --> 00:08:37.471
men and women from 16 countries
will build a foothold in the heavens,

00:08:37.597 --> 00:08:39.056
the International Space Station.

91
00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:43.978
With its vast expanses, scientists
and engineers will actually set sail


92
00:08:44.103 --> 00:08:48.316
on an uncharted sea of limitless mystery
and unlimited potential.

<i>We've drawn a lot of legacy
that we all have as seafaring nations.</i>


96

<i>What the space station provides</i>

97

<i>When I was a young boy,
the space program was starting</i>


101

<i>and everybody wanted to be an astronaut.</i>

102

<i>I didn't really have
a good prospect of that</i>


103

<i>until I was through college
and in the navy,</i>


104
00:09:49.627 --> 00:09:53.130
<i>and a chance came up to apply
for the space shuttle program,</i>


105
00:09:53.255 --> 00:09:55.466
<i>and that's how I got to NASA.</i>

106
00:09:56.717 --> 00:10:01.806
<i>When I was little, I used to cut up
two-by-fours and make little boats.</i>

<i>I'm still in the boat-building business.

<i>and there was a great amount
of common sense</i>


112
00:10:21.867 --> 00:10:25.413
<i>and a little bit of kind of
backyard diplomacy required for that.</i>

and as I had experience of working
on both Mir and the shuttle,


147
00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:02.403
<i>I was selected for that first crew.</i>

148
00:13:02.528 --> 00:13:06.448
<i>At first, Bill Shepherd and I
were the only ones there.</i>


149
00:13:06.574 --> 00:13:12.538
<i>Shortly afterwards,
Yuri Gidzenko was added to our crew.</i>


150
00:13:12.663 --> 00:13:14.206
<i>So that was the crew,</i>

151
00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:16.500
<i>Bill Shepherd, 
Yuri Gidzenko, and myself.</i>

152
00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:20.296
<i>We trained for nearly four years
for that first long-term mission.</i>


153
00:13:21.463 --> 00:13:22.840
<i>My name is Ginger Kerrick.</i>

154
00:13:22.965 --> 00:13:26.385
<i>I am currently a division chief
in the Flight Integration Division</i>


155
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.262
<i>at NASA Johnson Space Center.</i>

156
00:13:28.387 --> 00:13:31.432
<i>In the summer of '95,
I took my application</i>


157
00:13:31.557 --> 00:13:34.977
<i>and marched it down to the astronaut
selection office, turned it in.</i>


158
00:13:35.102 --> 00:13:40.232
They had received over 3,000 applicants
and had selected 120 to interview,


159
00:13:40.357 --> 00:13:42.276
and I was one of the 120.

160
00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:47.740
<i>I was 26 years old, and I thought,
"Oh, my gosh, my dream has come true."</i>


161
00:13:47.865 --> 00:13:50.159
<i>But when we went through interview week,</i>

162
00:13:50.284 --> 00:13:55.122
they did medical tests
and they found that I had kidney stones,


163
00:13:55.247 --> 00:13:58.000
and there was a new medical
disqualification enacted that year


164
00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:01.128
that if your body shows the ability
to form a single stone,


165
00:14:01.253 --> 00:14:04.089
it is a lifetime disqualification
from consideration.


166
00:14:04.214 --> 00:14:09.178
So I was devastated,
but I had started this new job


167
00:14:09.303 --> 00:14:12.306
where I got to teach astronauts
in the Mission Operations Directorate,


168
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:15.434
and I thought,
well, maybe astronaut wasn't for me.


169
00:14:15.559 --> 00:14:19.855
Maybe there's another path
that I was destined to take.


170
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.524
Maybe I'm 26 years old,
and I don't have everything figured out,


171
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.153
so how about I be open-minded
and see where this leads?


172
00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:15.285
Do you wanna go through these procedures
or do you want a general tour?


173
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:18.747
- General tour would be excellent.
- Okay, let's start up here.


174
00:15:18.872 --> 00:15:21.375
[Ginger] <i>I was assigned</i>
<i>to support the first crew</i>


175
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.627
<i>that was getting ready to fly on board</i>

176
00:15:23.752 --> 00:15:27.381
the yet-to-be-constructed
International Space Station.


177
00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:30.300
So I got assigned
to Captain William Shepherd,


178
00:15:30.426 --> 00:15:33.345
<i>Sergei Krikalev, and Yuri Gidzenko.</i>

179
00:15:36.056 --> 00:15:38.684
[Ginger] Here's the person
who's going to live in there.


180
00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:41.061
[Bill] Sergei, clean up your room.

181
00:15:42.563 --> 00:15:45.315
Open the door and throw everything out.

182
00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:47.276
[Ginger] <i>Those guys were great.</i>

183
00:15:47.401 --> 00:15:51.196
<i>From an age perspective,
Yuri was more my age,</i>


184
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:54.324
<i>Sergei was about the age
of my older brother,</i>


185
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.995
<i>and Shep was 20 years older
and kind of like a father figure.</i>


186
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.499
So managing those three personalities
took a unique skill set.


187
00:16:03.208 --> 00:16:04.960
[Bill] <i>This was a new vehicle.</i>

188
00:16:05.085 --> 00:16:08.255
<i>It had components
from 15 different countries.</i>


189
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.760
<i>The pieces were not gonna come together
until they met each other in orbit.</i>


190
00:16:12.885 --> 00:16:17.139
<i>Many of the techniques and procedures
we needed to operate it</i>


191
00:16:17.264 --> 00:16:18.599
<i>had not been written yet.</i>

192
00:16:18.724 --> 00:16:23.228
So our training was very much
"fly by the seat of your pants."


193
00:16:26.065 --> 00:16:28.609
[Sergei in Russian] <i>The training</i>
<i>was intense and unusual,</i>


194
00:16:28.734 --> 00:16:29.902
<i>even by modern standards.</i>

195
00:16:30.027 --> 00:16:35.449
The level of our training
was well above average,


196
00:16:35.574 --> 00:16:37.451
<i>because we studied a lot of things</i>

197
00:16:37.576 --> 00:16:40.537
<i>just in case there's an emergency
we cannot predict.</i>


198
00:16:41.955 --> 00:16:46.001
<i>We trained both in Houston
and here in Star City.</i>


199
00:16:46.126 --> 00:16:50.047
<i>It was a very interesting and friendly</i>

200
00:16:50.172 --> 00:16:52.800
experience exchange, information exchange,

201
00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:55.469
<i>emotional exchange, impressions exchange,</i>

202
00:16:55.594 --> 00:16:59.765
<i>because everyone could learn
something new.</i>


203
00:17:06.855 --> 00:17:10.109
[Ginger] <i>It was a wonderful experience,</i>

204
00:17:10.234 --> 00:17:13.278
<i>and if I had never watched the news,
I would never have suspected</i>


205
00:17:13.403 --> 00:17:16.824
<i>that there would be any antagonism
between Russia and the US,</i>


206
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:18.826
<i>based on my experience.</i>

207
00:17:18.951 --> 00:17:23.664
<i>Both of us have been in competition
since the early '60s,</i>


208
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:27.376
<i>trying to get to space,
the old space race,</i>


209
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:30.546
<i>but now we recognize that if we're gonna
go beyond low-Earth orbit,</i>


210
00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:32.923
<i>if we're gonna go
to the Moon or Mars,</i>

211
00:17:33.048 --> 00:17:35.968
<i>the only way to do that
is to do it together.</i>


212
00:17:44.309 --> 00:17:48.230
[Bill] <i>When we did land survival, we did</i>
<i>it in the winter outside of Moscow,</i>


213
00:17:48.355 --> 00:17:49.815
<i>and it was very wet and cold.</i>

214
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.526
<i>We were in a boilerplate capsule,
as if we had just landed,</i>


215
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:54.653
<i>we got out in our survival suits,</i>

216
00:17:54.778 --> 00:17:57.948
<i>and we had to build a little camp
and then survive.</i>


217
00:17:58.073 --> 00:18:02.077
<i>It was an extremely good experience
to bond the crew,</i>


218
00:18:02.202 --> 00:18:04.621
<i>and for time for us
to really get to know each other</i>


219
00:18:04.746 --> 00:18:09.585
<i>and contribute to what each of us
could offer as strengths and weaknesses.</i>


220
00:18:19.511 --> 00:18:21.346
[Bill] <i>We've been here for two days.</i>

221
00:18:21.471 --> 00:18:24.349
<i>Our launch is three days away, on Tuesday.</i>

222
00:18:24.474 --> 00:18:28.520
Everything in the vehicle looks
ready to go. Crew's well trained.


223
00:18:28.645 --> 00:18:32.107
We've been ready for probably a year
to go fly in space.


224
00:18:32.232 --> 00:18:34.776
It's just kind of a quiet time,

225
00:18:34.902 --> 00:18:38.572
thinking about everything we have to do
once we start flying,


226
00:18:38.697 --> 00:18:41.366
and Tuesday morning, we'll be ready.

227
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:43.202
[interviewer] Beth, any thoughts?

228
00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:47.372
Just still, I think, hard to believe
that we're actually here,


229
00:18:47.497 --> 00:18:54.338
and just looking forward
to watching a great launch, soâ€¦


230
00:18:54.463 --> 00:18:57.966
[Bill] <i>We launched</i>
<i>on the 31st of October, 2000.</i>


231
00:18:58.091 --> 00:19:02.638
<i>We're out in Baikonur
way out in the desert in Kazakhstan.</i>


232
00:19:02.763 --> 00:19:06.600
<i>We sign our names
to the door of the room that we're in.</i>


233
00:19:06.725 --> 00:19:08.727
<i>I drew a little picture of Space Station.</i>

[commentator] <i>Bill Shepherd's now joined</i>

235
00:19:10.604 --> 00:19:13.357
<i>by Johnson Space Center Director,
Mr. George Abbey.</i>


236
00:19:13.482 --> 00:19:15.984
<i>This is just before
the crew members were set</i>


237
00:19:16.109 --> 00:19:20.072
<i>to head over to the suit-up room
this morning shortly after wake-up.</i>


238
00:19:20.197 --> 00:19:21.740
[Bill] <i>We have a little breakfast,</i>

239
00:19:21.865 --> 00:19:25.869
<i>and then we go out
to the launch pad in a bus.</i>

00:19:25.994 --> 00:19:28.330
[commentator] <i>Bill Shepherd,</i>
<i>the commander of Expedition 1,</i>


241
00:19:28.455 --> 00:19:33.961
<i>along with Yuri Gidzenko
and Sergei Krikalev, now boarding a bus.</i>


242
00:19:34.086 --> 00:19:37.422
<i>The crew members will again head over
to the suit-up room.</i>


243
00:19:37.547 --> 00:19:41.009
[Bill] <i>The Russian approach to rules</i>
<i>is often quite different than the US,</i>


244
00:19:41.134 --> 00:19:44.972
<i>and that's one of the things
you get to appreciate sometimes.</i>


245
00:19:47.391 --> 00:19:52.020
In the United States,
we have a very regimented procedure


246
00:19:52.145 --> 00:19:55.607
for how you deal with friends and family
right before the launch.


247
00:19:55.732 --> 00:20:01.029
I waved goodbye to my wife
about two hours before we launched,


248
00:20:01.154 --> 00:20:04.574
<i>and then we're driving away in the bus,
and I saw her through the window.</i>


249
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.788
But then right as we're getting ready
to go out to the rocket,


250
00:20:09.913 --> 00:20:12.624
she surprised me from behind.

251
00:20:12.749 --> 00:20:14.334
Whoa! This wasâ€¦

252
00:20:14.459 --> 00:20:17.713
<i>It was great, but it was just
kind of an unexpected moment</i>

find in the US program.</i>

256

[Ginger] <i>I was in Baikonur, Kazakhstan,</i>
<i>and as soon as they shut the hatch,</i>


257
00:20:47.451 --> 00:20:49.202
I started hyperventilating,

258
00:20:49.328 --> 00:20:54.291
because I felt like
my brother and my dad, basically,


259
00:20:54.416 --> 00:20:58.712
were locked on a rocket,
and I couldn't process that.


260
00:20:58.837 --> 00:21:01.757
And one of the Russian generals got me

261
00:21:01.882 --> 00:21:04.885
and he's moving me through the crowd,
and he saysâ€¦


262

[speaks Russian]

263
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.931
That means, "It's the mother of the crew."

264
00:21:10.057 --> 00:21:13.685
And he was trying to part the crowd
so I could see my crew on video,


265
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.771
<i>and it made me feel a lot better.</i>

266

We became a family, and we all still
stay in touch to this day,

<i>We wouldn't have launched

271

a little bit of visibility,</i>

312

313

and doing it correctly.</i>


315
00:24:14.699 --> 00:24:16.451
<i>I was the neophyte.</i>

316
00:24:16.576 --> 00:24:19.996
I didn't think it was my place to get
in front of them and try and do that.


317
00:24:20.121 --> 00:24:23.708
But the second thing was,
as the commander,


318
00:24:23.833 --> 00:24:27.712
I wanted one of them to have the honor
of being the first one in.

328
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.920
<i>But back then
we were completely immersed in our work.</i>


329
00:25:09.045 --> 00:25:13.216
<i>We realized that we had reached
a station that was in a dormant mode</i>


330
00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.887
<i>and none of the systems could
really support the crew's functions.</i>


331
00:25:18.013 --> 00:25:22.892
Ahead of us there was
rather important and rather urgent work


332
00:25:23.018 --> 00:25:26.479
to activate all of the station systems

333
00:25:26.604 --> 00:25:31.651
for it to begin to work as it should,
supporting the crew's lives.


334
00:25:34.321 --> 00:25:39.534
[Bill] <i>We had about an hour and a half</i>

turn the lights on,
make sure the sound was right.


338

We couldn't find any of this stuff.

339
00:25:52.130 --> 00:25:55.759
So we're scrambling around
inside the module like madmen


340
00:25:55.884 --> 00:25:59.554
to figure out what this stuff was
and where to set it up,


341
00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:02.015
and we did it just in time.

342

[in Russian] <i>I'm Sergey Volkov,</i>
<i>a Russian pilot and cosmonaut.</i>


432
00:33:08.691 --> 00:33:14.864
<i>My father, Aleksandr Volkov,
also went to space, to the Mir station.</i>


433
00:33:14.989 --> 00:33:18.826
<i>I was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine,</i>

434
00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:22.997
<i>when my father was an instructor pilot.</i>

435
00:33:25.416 --> 00:33:28.211
Then he was selected
to join a cosmonaut group


436
00:33:28.336 --> 00:33:34.258
and our family moved to Star City
in 1978.


437
00:33:35.384 --> 00:33:37.136
<i>I was four at the time,</i>

438
00:33:37.261 --> 00:33:41.641
<i>so it feels like
I've lived my whole life in Star City.</i>


439
00:33:44.852 --> 00:33:47.063
<i>Because my father was a cosmonaut,</i>

440
00:33:47.188 --> 00:33:50.316
<i>I was seeing not just</i>

441
00:33:50.399 --> 00:33:54.987
<i>the public side of the profession.</i>

442
00:33:55.113 --> 00:33:56.656
<i>I saw it from the inside,</i>

443
00:33:56.781 --> 00:34:00.785
<i>and maybe that's why I didn't dream
of becoming a cosmonaut as a child.</i>


444
00:34:00.868 --> 00:34:07.834
<i>This profession seemed so heroic
and so difficult to me.</i>


445
00:34:10.336 --> 00:34:14.090
<i>When I grew up,
I made the conscious decision</i>


446
00:34:14.215 --> 00:34:19.053
to take on the responsibility
and accept the risks.


447
00:34:25.685 --> 00:34:27.436
<i>It was strange</i>

448
00:34:27.562 --> 00:34:32.400
<i>because my father
was the commanding officer</i>


449
00:34:32.525 --> 00:34:39.490
and he learned about me joining
by looking through case files


450
00:34:39.615 --> 00:34:43.411
of the candidates
selected for the physical.


451
00:34:43.536 --> 00:34:45.371
So he came home one night
with a question,


452
00:34:45.496 --> 00:34:48.457
<i>"Have you decided
to become a cosmonaut?"</i>


453
00:34:48.583 --> 00:34:51.460
<i>So we talked,
and that's when my mother learned</i>


454
00:34:51.586 --> 00:34:53.671
<i>about me wanting to be a cosmonaut.</i>

455
00:34:53.796 --> 00:35:00.052
Of course, it came as a surprise
for them, to put it mildly.


456
00:35:03.389 --> 00:35:06.058
<i>He came to all three of my take-offs.</i>

457
00:35:06.642 --> 00:35:11.105
It's a complicated mix of feelings,
but of positive feelings,


458
00:35:12.523 --> 00:35:18.154
because you train very hard,
for a long time.


459
00:35:18.279 --> 00:35:19.739
It took me ten years.

460
00:35:20.406 --> 00:35:26.370
<i>My father led me to the rocket.
We walked together, he supported me,</i>


461
00:35:26.495 --> 00:35:31.209
we walked from the bus
across the take-off pad,


462
00:35:31.334 --> 00:35:34.670
and he walked with me to the lift.

463
00:35:42.845 --> 00:35:48.434
Then when we were lifted up
inside the rocket,


464
00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:50.853
into our own spaceship,

465
00:35:50.978 --> 00:35:56.609
we were closed in.
You hear the rocket come alive.

467

you're inside, you're one with it,
and when the launch actually starts,


468
00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:16.337
<i>you hear the engines work down there,</i>

469

<i>this calm vibration, the right kind.</i>

470

<i>The second the rocket goes,

553
00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:32.212
<i>I figured there was no way I was gonna
get selected, so I loaned him my suit.</i>


554
00:42:32.338 --> 00:42:35.215
<i>Then they call me

"Hey, we wanna interview you as well."

556
00:42:38.677 --> 00:42:41.639
So I tell my brother, "Hey, Mark,
NASA called me for an interview,


557
00:42:41.764 --> 00:42:45.392
but you understand, you know,
you gotta buy me a new suit, right,


558

580
00:43:58.006 --> 00:44:00.384
[Scott] <i>It looks like the space shuttle</i>
<i>lifts off slowly.</i>


581
00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:03.011
<i>When you're inside of it,
there is nothing slow about that.</i>


582
00:44:03.095 --> 00:44:07.850
<i>It's seven million pounds of thrust
instantly on your back</i>


583
00:44:07.975 --> 00:44:11.687
<i>and you feel like
you can feel every pound of it.</i>


584
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.357

<i>One minute, 30 seconds into the flight.</i>

590
00:44:35.502 --> 00:44:36.962

[man] <i>As a glass artist,</i>

610

<i>Glass is just sand.
It's part of the Earth.</i>


612

<i>When it's hot, glass is alive.</i>

613
00:46:36.999 --> 00:46:39.084
<i>It has an inner light.</i>

614
00:46:40.002 --> 00:46:43.755
<i>It is a weird twist of fate
that I was making planets</i>


615
00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:48.260
<i>and making space-related artwork
long before Cady and I met.</i>

[Cady] <i>Thrusters are stable.</i>

[Josh] <i>There's this burst of light</i>

630
00:47:29.301 --> 00:47:33.013
<i>As it goes higher up into the sky,
the light gets brighter,</i>

this little, bright pinpoint of light.</i>

<i>Okay, copy.

642
00:48:28.944 --> 00:48:34.199
<i>My dad worked on the Sealab program,
where men first lived under the sea,</i>


643
00:48:34.324 --> 00:48:39.037
<i>and I think it became normal to me
that it just was part of life,</i>


644
00:48:39.162 --> 00:48:43.250
<i>that people would live in places
that not many people lived.</i>


645
00:48:43.375 --> 00:48:45.711
The bottom of the ocean
was part of our world,


646
00:48:45.836 --> 00:48:47.671
we just hadn't been there yet.

647
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:59.850
<i>I loved being underwater
and having it be effortless,</i>


648
00:48:59.975 --> 00:49:02.811
<i>where you could breathe
and you could see,</i>


649
00:49:02.936 --> 00:49:07.232
<i>and I felt like I was in somebody else's
world and I got to explore it.</i>


650
00:49:18.994 --> 00:49:25.751
One of my favorite places
on the space station is our cupola.


651
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.714
It is amazing up here.

652
00:49:32.382 --> 00:49:34.760
Windows on all sides.

653
00:49:36.928 --> 00:49:39.389
<i>When I found out
that I got accepted as an astronaut,</i>


654
00:49:39.514 --> 00:49:44.895
I had been dating a really nice guy
who lived in Western Massachusetts


655
00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.273
that I had met by basically
calling a wrong phone number.


656
00:49:48.398 --> 00:49:52.819
One night, the phone rang
and I answered the phone, and I said,


657
00:49:52.944 --> 00:49:54.988
[in Russian accent]
"Hello. What do you want?"


658
00:49:55.113 --> 00:49:58.909
And this perfectly nice woman said,
"Is this Peter?"


659
00:49:59.034 --> 00:50:00.702
And I said, "No, this is not Peter.

660
00:50:00.827 --> 00:50:05.916
My name is Olga Isnitchko
Eavorskayagoopdamehamatalliaihgatana."


661
00:50:06.041 --> 00:50:09.878
And she said, "I'm so sorry.
I thought you were Peter Masters.


662
00:50:10.003 --> 00:50:11.338
I'm looking for his wife, Amy."

663
00:50:11.463 --> 00:50:14.090
And when she said that,
I knew who she was looking for,


664
00:50:14.216 --> 00:50:18.053
because Amy had worked
in my studio years before.


665
00:50:18.178 --> 00:50:20.096
And so I said,
"Well, if you want to find Amy,


666
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:23.308
you have to look
in the telephone directory,


667
00:50:23.433 --> 00:50:25.602
but when you get Amy on the phone,

668
00:50:25.727 --> 00:50:30.649
you must say hello from Olga Isnitchko
Eavorskayagoopdamehamatalliaihga."


669
00:50:30.774 --> 00:50:34.277
She was so polite,
and I just kept pulling her leg.


670
00:50:34.402 --> 00:50:38.281
And so I made her practice this name
over and over and over again,


671
00:50:38.406 --> 00:50:41.535
and she finally got
it, and I hung up.

672
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.621
But when she got her friend Amy
on the phone, she said,


673
00:50:44.746 --> 00:50:46.039
"There's this really weird man

674
00:50:46.164 --> 00:50:48.875
at the place where you worked,
you used to work."


675
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.295
And Amy just cracked up and said,

676
00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.590
"That's Josh.
He disguises his voice at night.


677
00:50:55.715 --> 00:50:58.802
He hatesâ€¦ He doesn't wanna get
an answering machine."


678
00:50:58.927 --> 00:51:03.390
And so Cady decided to call me back.

679
00:51:03.515 --> 00:51:06.643
And so she called me back
with a Russian accent,


680
00:51:06.768 --> 00:51:09.729
and she said she was from Russian KGB

681
00:51:09.855 --> 00:51:12.023
and there had been numerous reports
of glass-breaking.


682
00:51:12.148 --> 00:51:15.485
And I said,
"I'm not Russian. I'm Bulgarian."


683
00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:17.946
And she said,
"We do them too, and you're history."


684
00:51:18.572 --> 00:51:23.159
<i>When we met, it was obvious to me
that we should be together.</i>


685
00:51:23.285 --> 00:51:26.913
<i>It took her a long time
to come around to that viewpoint.</i>


686
00:51:27.706 --> 00:51:29.666
When you tell people
that you live in Houston


687
00:51:29.791 --> 00:51:32.669
and your boyfriend
lives in Western Massachusetts,


688
00:51:32.794 --> 00:51:36.131
they look at you, like,
"Well, that's gonna last."


689
00:51:36.256 --> 00:51:39.134
And so we invented a new word
which was "sweetheart,"


690
00:51:39.259 --> 00:51:42.262
which seemed somehow more long-term.

691
00:51:42.387 --> 00:51:46.641
But I was really glad
that I sort of already knew the person


692
00:51:46.766 --> 00:51:49.769
I was gonna spend
the rest of my life with.


693
00:51:49.895 --> 00:51:53.481
<i>Before I applied, before, there was
sort of this aspect of this job</i>


694
00:51:53.607 --> 00:51:56.443
<i>that's hard for people
to get their arms around.</i>


695
00:51:56.568 --> 00:51:58.528
<i>"What does it mean?
What does it mean for her?</i>


696
00:51:58.653 --> 00:52:01.323
<i>What does it mean for me?
What's our life gonna be like?"</i>


697
00:52:01.448 --> 00:52:03.867
It was really nice
to have already met somebody


698
00:52:03.992 --> 00:52:07.787
that already seemed to love
all those things about me.


699
00:52:07.913 --> 00:52:10.290
[Josh] <i>When Cady</i>
<i>was accepted as an astronaut,</i>


700
00:52:10.373 --> 00:52:11.583
<i>the first thing that happened</i>

701
00:52:11.708 --> 00:52:16.087
<i>was that you have to show up to work
at Johnson Space Center in Houston.</i>


702
00:52:16.212 --> 00:52:19.299
<i>And so when Jamey was born,</i>

703
00:52:19.424 --> 00:52:22.135
we knew that either
Jamey was going to have to travel,


704
00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.263
or, because I have a glass studio here,

705
00:52:25.388 --> 00:52:29.309
<i>it turned out that I became
the prime parent and Cady would travel,</i>


706
00:52:29.434 --> 00:52:34.564
and I've always understood
that I'm gonna be the prime parent.


707
00:52:35.607 --> 00:52:40.278
<i>When Cady got first assigned
even to her first mission,</i>


708
00:52:40.403 --> 00:52:43.782
I was pretty worried
about what was gonna happen to her,


709
00:52:43.907 --> 00:52:47.118
whether she was gonna be safe,
whether it was gonna be okay,


710
00:52:47.243 --> 00:52:51.706
until I was kind of an emotional wreck.

711
00:52:51.831 --> 00:52:55.794
But then it occurred to me that
there are literally thousands of people


712
00:52:55.919 --> 00:52:59.339
<i>who are concerned
with her safety and well-being,</i>


713
00:52:59.464 --> 00:53:03.760
<i>and nothing that I'm doing,
nothing, no amount of worry,</i>


714
00:53:03.885 --> 00:53:09.683
no amount of stress on my part
was gonna help one way or the other.


715
00:53:09.808 --> 00:53:13.812
And I also thought about the fact
that Cady took this job


716
00:53:13.937 --> 00:53:18.984
<i>because, well, she wanted to do
that kind of exploration,</i>


717
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:22.362
<i>she also knew full well
the dangers involved.</i>


718
00:53:22.487 --> 00:53:27.492
And she's completelyâ€¦
I don't think she wants to die,


719
00:53:27.617 --> 00:53:33.081
but I think she's willing to make
that sacrifice if that's the way it works.


720
00:53:33.206 --> 00:53:37.752
And I just thought, "Well,
if my sweetheart is willing to do that,


721
00:53:37.877 --> 00:53:40.296
then I should just let go there."

722
00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:42.340
It's gonna fine,
or it's not gonna be fine,


723
00:53:42.465 --> 00:53:46.970
but nothing that I'm gonna do or say
is gonna make any difference.


724
00:53:47.095 --> 00:53:52.892
And that works right until
you get to the, "Ten, nine, eightâ€¦"


725
00:53:53.018 --> 00:53:56.146
And then, of course,
all of that's out the window.


726
00:53:56.271 --> 00:53:57.856
You're completelyâ€¦

727
00:54:02.402 --> 00:54:09.367
There's just this flow of worry
and pride and frightened emotion,


728
00:54:09.492 --> 00:54:12.162
and then the rocket goes off

729
00:54:12.287 --> 00:54:15.874
and about eight minutes later,
they're in space.


730
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:28.720
Bye, Cady.

731
00:54:48.281 --> 00:54:50.700
[interviewer] <i>Josh,</i>
<i>Cady's ticket to ride is behind you</i>


732
00:54:50.825 --> 00:54:53.161
<i>here on the launch pad
at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</i>


733
00:54:53.286 --> 00:54:57.373
<i>Your thoughts as you saw
this whole process. Amazing for you?</i>


734
00:54:57.499 --> 00:55:00.126
[Josh] <i>Just a whole cascade</i>
<i>of thoughts, really,</i>


735
00:55:00.251 --> 00:55:07.217
<i>that this is, for Cady, the culmination
of a dream, a lifetime of preparation.</i>


736
00:55:08.718 --> 00:55:15.100
This is the spot where Yuri Gagarin
left from and where <i>Sputnik</i> left from,


737
00:55:15.225 --> 00:55:17.977
and where my sweetheart is going to go.

738
00:55:18.103 --> 00:55:19.354
It's very significant.

739
00:55:19.479 --> 00:55:22.232
<i>I think she's ready,
although, knowing my wife,</i>


740
00:55:22.357 --> 00:55:26.236
<i>she'll be packing right to the last
instant before she goes on board.</i>


741
00:55:35.662 --> 00:55:39.374
<i>The morning that she took off,</i>

742
00:55:39.499 --> 00:55:42.752
<i>we woke up in the middle of the night,
it must have been 2:00 in the morning,</i>


743
00:55:42.877 --> 00:55:44.629
<i>and we drove to the launch site.</i>

744
00:55:44.754 --> 00:55:47.090
<i>It was really cold.</i>

745
00:55:50.677 --> 00:55:53.721
<i>We were a mile away,</i>

746
00:55:53.847 --> 00:55:58.726
<i>but it was just sort of a cement platform
where we viewed the launch,</i>


747
00:55:58.852 --> 00:56:04.107
<i>and it was so cold
that no amount of clothing helped.</i>


748
00:56:04.232 --> 00:56:07.193
The cold just cut right through you.

749
00:56:08.027 --> 00:56:11.489
[commentator] <i>Here on the ground</i>
<i>in Baikonur, a crowd of family and friends</i>

753
00:56:19.956 --> 00:56:26.504
It was really challenging for Jamey
at launch because I think that sudden,


754
00:56:26.629 --> 00:56:29.174
"I understand what Dad's
been talking about all this time.


755
00:56:29.299 --> 00:56:33.011
That's a rocket.
That's my mom. She's gone."


756
00:56:33.136 --> 00:56:35.722
And there was
a flood of emotion for him,


757
00:56:35.847 --> 00:56:39.976
and, for me, I was concerned about him

758
00:56:40.059 --> 00:56:43.730
as much as I was concerned for Cady.

759
00:56:44.189 --> 00:56:46.900
And I realize that
he was turning to me

760
00:56:47.025 --> 00:56:51.154
and was kind of hanging on to me
and he was in tears.


761
00:57:24.062 --> 00:57:27.565
<i>Watching it go up
was profound for Jamey.</i>


762
00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:29.692
<i>I think he realized thatâ€¦</i>

763
00:57:32.362 --> 00:57:34.656
<i>his mom was really gone.</i>

764

765
00:57:40.745 --> 00:57:44.040
<i>leaving behind her husband

766
00:57:44.165 --> 00:57:47.252
<i>John, I know that you've been anxious
to talk to Cady up there in space,</i>


767
00:57:47.377 --> 00:57:48.461
<i>so why don't you go first?</i>

768
00:57:48.586 --> 00:57:50.838
[John] <i>Cady, to you,</i>
<i>are you getting settled in?</i>

<i>You got the toothbrush put away
and the socks in the sock drawer?</i>


770
00:57:55.218 --> 00:57:58.096
You know, I've gotten
so I feel actually right at home here,


771
00:57:58.221 --> 00:57:59.847
I think it's just like any other place,

772
00:57:59.973 --> 00:58:03.643
and then sometimes there's things
that remind me that we're in space.


773
00:58:04.435 --> 00:58:05.562
Like this.

774
00:58:06.813 --> 00:58:08.856
<i>- You know, youâ€¦</i>
- Take it.


775

<i>It's another one of those bad-hair days
for Cady up in space.</i>


776
00:58:13.361 --> 00:58:15.446
[Jamey] <i>I remember, like,</i>
<i>saying goodbye to my mom,</i>


777
00:58:15.572 --> 00:58:20.785
like, seeing her walk out
of the sort of prep facility.


778
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:24.789
And I was, like,
"Okay, like, this is it," you know.


779
00:58:24.914 --> 00:58:26.833
And I hadn't started crying quite then,

780
00:58:26.958 --> 00:58:30.044
but then when I saw the rocket
ascending into the sky,


781
00:58:30.169 --> 00:58:32.714
I was, like, "Wow, my mom isn't here."

782
00:58:32.839 --> 00:58:35.466
It really brought me to tears
'cause it was just, like,


783
00:58:35.592 --> 00:58:39.554
"Wow, my mom
isn't on the planet anymore."

<i>I had a strong longing

790
00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.402
<i>when I saw the Apollo lunar landing.</i>

791
00:59:36.527 --> 00:59:39.030
<i>At the time,
there were no Japanese astronauts,</i>


792
00:59:39.155 --> 00:59:44.702

it seemed like an unreachable goal.</i>

A one-week, two-week flight
can pass really quickly,


815
01:01:40.651 --> 01:01:44.280

01:05:49.859 --> 01:05:54.321
<i>and as I did, this big, grey cloud
enveloped southern Manhattan.</i>


859
01:05:54.447 --> 01:05:57.575
<i>It turned out later what I was seeing
was the second tower collapse.</i>


860
01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:01.537
I told the guys, "90 minutes from now,
when we come back over the US,


861
01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:03.748
I want every camera we've got
pointed at the ground."


862
01:06:03.831 --> 01:06:07.334
<i>As we went over Maine,
we could see New York City</i>


863
01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.545
<i>and the smoke from the fires.</i>

864
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.964
<i>Our prayers and thoughts
go out to all the people there</i>


865
01:06:12.089 --> 01:06:13.758
<i>and everywhere else here.</i>

866
01:06:13.883 --> 01:06:17.553
<i>I'm looking up and down the east coast
to see if I can see anything else.</i>


867
01:06:20.222 --> 01:06:22.433
[woman] <i>Frank,</i>
<i>that's an accurate assessment.</i>


868
01:06:23.059 --> 01:06:26.562
[Frank] <i>All the contrails which normally</i>
<i>cover the country in a spider web</i>


869
01:06:26.687 --> 01:06:27.730
<i>had disappeared,</i>

870
01:06:27.855 --> 01:06:29.732
<i>because they had grounded
all the airplanes.</i>


871
01:06:29.857 --> 01:06:33.694
<i>That really brought it home that
this was a totally different world now.</i>


872
01:06:36.572 --> 01:06:40.701
They had had to evacuate the federal
facility where our mission control was


873
01:06:40.826 --> 01:06:43.079
and move them
to an undisclosed location,


874
01:06:43.204 --> 01:06:45.998
which I still don't know where it was.

875
01:06:46.123 --> 01:06:48.084
So we were operating
with Moscow primarily,


876
01:06:48.209 --> 01:06:50.044
<i>and they were
very supportive, sympathetic,</i>


877
01:06:50.169 --> 01:06:52.630
<i>and trying to give us
as much information as they could.</i>


878
01:06:52.713 --> 01:06:55.132
<i>Whenever one of their specials
would come on to talk to us</i>


879
01:06:55.216 --> 01:06:58.427
<i>about a system or an experiment
or whatever, they would frequently say,</i>


880
01:06:58.552 --> 01:07:01.388
"Where's Frank?",
you know, "How's Frank doing?"


881
01:07:03.766 --> 01:07:06.185
It was very meaningful,
'cause I knew them all by name,


882
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:09.271
and they would express their condolences

883
01:07:09.396 --> 01:07:11.565
and they were really sorry
for what happened.


884
01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:15.277
Interesting thing is, 94 Russians
also died in the World Trade Center,


885
01:07:15.402 --> 01:07:17.113
and we had no idea, at that time,

886
01:07:17.238 --> 01:07:20.699
how many from overseas were there
and lost their lives.


887
01:07:20.825 --> 01:07:23.202
The next day,
I got a call from TJ Creamer,


888
01:07:23.327 --> 01:07:25.621
who was my support astronaut
on the ground, and he said,


889
01:07:25.746 --> 01:07:27.706
"Frank, I've got some bad news."

890
01:07:27.832 --> 01:07:31.043
And it turned out that my classmate
from the Naval Academy,


891
01:07:31.168 --> 01:07:33.712
who was classmates with Shep and myself,

892
01:07:33.838 --> 01:07:36.132
<i>was the captain
of American Airlines Flight 77</i>


893
01:07:36.257 --> 01:07:38.342
<i>that was crashed into the Pentagon.</i>

894
01:07:38.467 --> 01:07:41.220
<i>Chic was an F-4 pilot, like me,
he was an aerospace engineer,</i>


895
01:07:41.303 --> 01:07:44.265
<i>we had actually played in the drum
and bugle corps together for a while,</i>


896
01:07:44.348 --> 01:07:45.516
<i>so we were friends.</i>

897
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:49.687
And so he had died in that crash.

898
01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:51.647
I could only imagine
what it was like for him.


899
01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:54.066
I didn't find out much
until after I returned


900
01:07:54.191 --> 01:07:56.193
about what the particulars were
of that flight,


901
01:07:56.318 --> 01:07:59.446
but I felt sure he had fought
as much as he could.


902
01:08:00.447 --> 01:08:01.699
<i>It really brought it home to me</i>

903
01:08:01.782 --> 01:08:04.451
<i>and it made it very personal
at that point.</i>


904
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:09.623
I would like to send a message
from the station down in memory of Chic


905
01:08:09.748 --> 01:08:12.626
and of all of our graduates who perished

906
01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:15.171
and of all the victims of this tragedy,

907
01:08:15.296 --> 01:08:18.132
something that has
never been done before from space.


908
01:08:18.257 --> 01:08:22.720
So I'd like to ask all of you to rise
for a moment of silence


909
01:08:22.845 --> 01:08:26.140
as we play something
from International Space Station Alpha.

<i>This dream of flying to space,

[children laugh]

942

<i>I'm Samantha Cristoforetti</i>

943

<i>and I'm an astronaut
with the European Space Agency.</i>


944
01:11:59.937 --> 01:12:03.941
We had started out
with over 8,000 applicants,


945
01:12:04.066 --> 01:12:06.527
and then here we were,
after a year, only ten of us.


946
01:12:06.652 --> 01:12:09.238
Ten young Europeans
from different countries.


947
01:12:09.363 --> 01:12:11.323
At that point,
we were almost all in touch.


948
01:12:11.448 --> 01:12:13.367
There was going to be
a press conference,


949
01:12:13.492 --> 01:12:16.036
and the European Space Agency
was going to announce,


950
01:12:16.161 --> 01:12:19.164
"Here are our new astronauts."

951
01:12:19.289 --> 01:12:23.836
And two days before that, at nine o'clock
at night, we still had not heard.


952
01:12:23.961 --> 01:12:27.923
I mean, my level of tension
was way up there.


953
01:12:28.048 --> 01:12:31.135
I just felt
that I couldn't take it anymore.


954
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:34.388
<i>And then all of a sudden,
there was this email, and it's like,</i>


955
01:12:34.513 --> 01:12:36.140
<i>"Dear Miss Cristoforettiâ€¦"</i>

956
01:12:36.265 --> 01:12:38.016
You just felt like
the universe had stopped


957
01:12:38.142 --> 01:12:41.311
and it turned back
and smiled at me at that time.


958
01:12:41.437 --> 01:12:45.315
<i>The fact that you are selected
as an astronaut is huge, you know.</i>


959
01:12:45.441 --> 01:12:48.444
<i>You're not any more
one of the thousands, ten thousands,</i>


960
01:12:48.569 --> 01:12:50.863
maybe millions of people
who dream of becoming astronauts.


961
01:12:50.988 --> 01:12:53.782
You actually are selected
to train as an astronaut.


962
01:12:53.907 --> 01:12:56.452
But then this new
phase of your life comes

963
01:12:56.577 --> 01:12:58.996
<i>when you're just waiting and hoping</i>

964
01:12:59.121 --> 01:13:02.291
<i>that this moment is going to come
and is going to come soon.</i>


965
01:13:04.334 --> 01:13:06.462
One of the greatest memories I have

966
01:13:06.587 --> 01:13:11.592
from the time leading up
to my space flight is being in Baikonur.


967
01:13:11.717 --> 01:13:15.220
That's where we launched from.
And you go to Baikonur twice.


968
01:13:15.345 --> 01:13:17.556
<i>You go to Baikonur
before your own launch,</i>


969
01:13:17.681 --> 01:13:19.600
<i>and you go to Baikonur
six months before,</i>


970
01:13:19.725 --> 01:13:21.810
when you are actually the back-up crew.

971
01:13:21.935 --> 01:13:24.938
So, you are, in theory, ready to fly
instead of the prime crew


972
01:13:25.063 --> 01:13:26.815
if the prime crew has an issue.

973
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:30.777
And we were down there,
Terry, Anton and myself,


974
01:13:30.903 --> 01:13:35.949
<i>in May 2014, as the back-up crew,
and that was the most wonderful time.</i>


975
01:13:36.074 --> 01:13:38.577
We are usually allowed to go out
and have a jog


976
01:13:38.702 --> 01:13:40.621
with other people
who are in quarantine with us.


977
01:13:40.746 --> 01:13:44.791
We kind of bend the rules because
we'd just go out without any escort.


978
01:13:44.917 --> 01:13:48.378
And basically what I wanted to do,
I had a bottle with me,


979
01:13:48.504 --> 01:13:52.174
and I had put in
a picture of the three of us.


980
01:13:52.299 --> 01:13:55.302
We had signed thousands
of those pictures in the days before,


981
01:13:55.427 --> 01:13:57.429
and so I had grabbed one
with our signature,


982
01:13:57.554 --> 01:14:01.642
and I had added an email address
that I had just done for that purpose.


983
01:14:01.767 --> 01:14:03.810
And I thought,
"We'll just throw it in the river


984
01:14:03.894 --> 01:14:06.605
and then maybe
some mysterious inhabitant of the steppe


985
01:14:06.730 --> 01:14:08.190
one day will write back to us."

986
01:14:08.857 --> 01:14:10.192
We are about to come back

987
01:14:10.317 --> 01:14:15.447
and we realize a little bit upstream
there are, like, these wild horses,


988
01:14:15.572 --> 01:14:16.949
<i>such a beautiful image.</i>

989
01:14:17.074 --> 01:14:21.203
<i>There were probably, maybe

990
01:14:21.328 --> 01:14:23.455
<i>there were no people,
just the wild horses,</i>


991
01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.290
<i>and they had come
to drink at the river.</i>

992
01:14:25.415 --> 01:14:29.670
<i>And it was such a beautiful,
powerful scene, you know.</i>


993
01:14:29.795 --> 01:14:34.341
And for me it was just something
that brought me into the emotional mood


994
01:14:34.466 --> 01:14:37.803
of then watching the launch
in the night.


995
01:14:45.978 --> 01:14:47.104
[man] <i>And lift-off.</i>

996

to the International Space Station.</i>


997
01:14:53.318 --> 01:14:54.444
<i>Right now, looking good.</i>

998
01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:59.324
<i>First stage performance. The</i> Soyuz
<i>delivering 930,000 pounds of thrust.</i>


999
01:14:59.449 --> 01:15:02.035
<i>That's four boosters
and single core and engine.</i>

<i>We had a Saturday morning

1097
01:22:48.668 --> 01:22:51.463
We went in to start the teleconference

1098
01:22:51.588 --> 01:22:55.425
<i>and the folks in Mission Control
asked us to just stand by.</i>


1099
01:22:57.343 --> 01:22:59.471
<i>It was usual that,
because it was Saturday morning,</i>


1100
01:22:59.596 --> 01:23:01.973
<i>the folks in Houston wanted
to get that teleconference over</i>


1101
01:23:02.057 --> 01:23:05.018
as quickly as possible 'cause some
people wanted to go home, right?


1102
01:23:05.143 --> 01:23:07.729
So for them to ask us to wait
was a little bit different.


1103
01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:13.068
<i>The center director
of Johnson Space Center came on</i>


1104
01:23:13.193 --> 01:23:16.863
<i>and told us</i>
<i>that</i> Columbia <i>had been lost on entry.</i>


1105
01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:45.225
There was a lot of different meanings
to that for us.


1106
01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:49.020
The first was, "Well, what's happened
to our friends who are on <i>Columbia?"</i>


1107
01:23:49.229 --> 01:23:52.941
<i>'Cause we knew those folks,
we worked with them in the office,</i>


1108
01:23:53.066 --> 01:23:54.692
<i>would fly with them in the T-38s,</i>

1109
01:23:54.818 --> 01:23:57.862
<i>sat in meetings with them,
talked to them in the hallways.</i>


1110
01:23:57.987 --> 01:24:00.698
<i>So the first thing was,
"What's happened to them?" you know.</i>


1111
01:24:00.824 --> 01:24:03.284
<i>Is there any chance
that they made it through?</i>


1112
01:24:04.369 --> 01:24:08.081
Folks on the ground have been real good
about reducing our schedule


1113
01:24:08.206 --> 01:24:10.708
and we've had time
to grieve our friends.


1114
01:24:10.834 --> 01:24:12.335
And that was very important.

1115
01:24:12.418 --> 01:24:15.296
When you're up here this long,
you can't just bottle up your emotions


1116
01:24:15.421 --> 01:24:16.756
and focus all the time.

1117
01:24:16.881 --> 01:24:20.552
It's important for us to acknowledge
that the people on STS-107


1118
01:24:20.677 --> 01:24:23.346
were our friends,
that we had a connection with them,


1119
01:24:23.471 --> 01:24:25.348
and that we feel their loss.

1120
01:24:25.473 --> 01:24:29.686
The next impact to us was, "Well,
what does that mean for us to come home?"


1121
01:24:32.188 --> 01:24:34.607
<i>Since the space shuttles
were under review,</i>


1122
01:24:34.732 --> 01:24:37.485
we had to decide
when it would be safe to fly one again


1123
01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:40.363
and how to fly it safely.

1124
01:24:40.488 --> 01:24:43.241
The decision was made for us
to come home a different way,


1125
01:24:43.366 --> 01:24:46.619
to come home in a <i>Soyuz</i> spacecraft.

1126
01:24:46.744 --> 01:24:50.415
<i>So we're packing up gear
to be returned home aboard shuttles</i>


1127
01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:51.958
<i>when they start flying again.</i>

1128
01:24:52.083 --> 01:24:56.713
<i>We'll have some refresher training to do
over the next month and a half or so.</i>


1129
01:24:56.838 --> 01:24:58.506
<i>My family spent most of their time</i>

1130
01:24:58.631 --> 01:25:01.634
worrying about the people
that were affected on the ground,


1131
01:25:01.759 --> 01:25:05.889
the effect on the spouses
for the crew of <i>Columbia.</i>


1132
01:25:06.014 --> 01:25:09.225
But they also had a lot of inquiries
from different people


1133
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:13.354
wanting to know how they felt
with their husbands up in space,


1134
01:25:13.479 --> 01:25:15.440
knowing that it was a risky business.

1135
01:25:15.565 --> 01:25:18.151
Everybody wanted to know
what we thought about the risk.


1136
01:25:18.276 --> 01:25:22.197
Let me start by sort of comparing
what a <i>Soyuz</i> flight is like


1137
01:25:22.322 --> 01:25:25.533
compared to a return in a space shuttle.

1138
01:25:25.658 --> 01:25:28.912
<i>The space shuttle is a lot more
like flying on an airliner,</i>


1139
01:25:29.037 --> 01:25:33.082
<i>and the return from space is
very similar to flying on an airliner,</i>


1140
01:25:33.208 --> 01:25:34.626
<i>except you go from being weightless</i>

1141
01:25:34.751 --> 01:25:38.880
<i>to having your perceived weight be maybe
one and a half times your normal weight.</i>


1142
01:25:39.005 --> 01:25:43.134
<i>And then the final approach
is like a steep glide in an airliner</i>


1143
01:25:43.218 --> 01:25:44.552
<i>and you touch down on a runway.</i>

1144
01:25:44.636 --> 01:25:48.890
It feels very much like any touchdown
from an international flight.


1145
01:25:51.726 --> 01:25:56.773
<i>On a</i> Soyuz, <i>you get in, it's smaller,</i>
<i>everything is more compact.</i>


1146
01:25:56.898 --> 01:25:59.108
<i>Instead of sitting up,
like you would on an airliner,</i>


1147
01:25:59.234 --> 01:26:02.737
<i>you're kind of laying on your back,
and it's a much quicker trip home.</i>


1148
01:26:02.862 --> 01:26:04.864
<i>It's only a few hours back to Earth</i>

1149
01:26:04.989 --> 01:26:08.409
<i>rather than a day and a half or two
in a space shuttle.</i>


1150
01:26:08.534 --> 01:26:10.495
It's a little bit more
like a carnival ride.


1151
01:26:11.913 --> 01:26:16.459
[man] <i>And Expedition 6</i>
<i>now officially on its way back home,</i>


1152
01:26:16.584 --> 01:26:19.921

than three hours from now.</i>


1153
01:26:22.215 --> 01:26:23.883
[Ken] <i>The flight gets most interesting</i>

1154
01:26:24.008 --> 01:26:26.386
<i>when you start to get down
into the atmosphere.</i>


1155
01:26:27.595 --> 01:26:30.265
<i>First thing you see
is some glowing light</i>


1156
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:33.518
<i>coming off the side of the capsule
and any other parts around it.</i>


1157
01:26:33.643 --> 01:26:35.895
<i>You see a bright orange glow
outside the windows.</i>


1158
01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.732
<i>You might see little droplets running
along the window that look like water</i>


1159
01:26:39.857 --> 01:26:43.027
<i>but are really something melted
on the spacecraft.</i>


1160
01:26:43.152 --> 01:26:45.154
[man] <i>At this point,</i>
<i>the crew should be feeling</i>


1161
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.241
<i>the maximum G-load on the re-entry.</i>

1162
01:26:48.366 --> 01:26:50.243
[man speaks in Russian]

1163
01:26:53.037 --> 01:26:57.333
We realized that we were having
an off-nominal type of entry


1164
01:26:57.458 --> 01:26:58.960
called a ballistic descent.

1165
01:27:00.670 --> 01:27:02.964
Once you reach
the ballistic descent mode,


1166
01:27:03.089 --> 01:27:06.926
<i>there's not a lot for the crew
to interact with on the spacecraft,</i>


1167
01:27:07.051 --> 01:27:10.138
and so you have some spare moments
to think about what you're doing


1168
01:27:10.263 --> 01:27:13.891
and to realize how little control
you have over the situation,


1169
01:27:14.017 --> 01:27:16.269
how you're trusting the engineers
who designed


1170
01:27:16.394 --> 01:27:19.439
<i>and the technicians
who built that spacecraft,</i>


1171
01:27:19.564 --> 01:27:22.608
<i>and how everything's gotta work
if you're gonna survive.</i>


1172
01:27:38.833 --> 01:27:43.046
I'm in the helicopter with the chief
of the astronaut office, Bob Cabana,


1173
01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:46.090
<i>and they say, "We're in touch
with the crew. We're hearing the crew."</i>


1174
01:27:46.174 --> 01:27:47.842
But it was a very faint call.

1175
01:27:50.219 --> 01:27:52.472
<i>I could tell my boss
was really, really worried.</i>


1176
01:27:52.555 --> 01:27:54.891
<i>He said, "Why is the signal faint?
Can they hear them?"</i>


1177
01:27:54.974 --> 01:27:56.184
<i>I said, "They can't hear them.</i>

1178
01:27:56.309 --> 01:27:58.644
<i>They heard them on the radio
and then it disappeared."</i>


1179
01:27:59.228 --> 01:28:01.814
Bob Cabana was like,
"Oh, no, we've lost another crew."


1180
01:28:06.736 --> 01:28:09.072
<i>They said, "They did a ballistic entry."</i>

1181
01:28:09.197 --> 01:28:13.326
To mean they're 400 kilometers away,
off-course,


1182
01:28:13.451 --> 01:28:15.286
and not in the right place,
not where we are.


1183
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.672
When the parachutes come out, you get
rocked all around, shaken, rotated.


1184
01:28:26.798 --> 01:28:28.299
<i>It feels pretty violent.</i>

1185
01:28:28.424 --> 01:28:31.344
<i>Again, that's where it feels
most like a carnival ride.</i>


1186
01:28:33.638 --> 01:28:35.098
<i>And then it gets peaceful,</i>

1187
01:28:35.223 --> 01:28:38.309
<i>and you coast and coast and coast down
underneath the parachutes.</i>


1188
01:28:45.733 --> 01:28:48.778
<i>There's sort of a big bang
as you hit the ground.</i>


1189
01:28:48.903 --> 01:28:50.863
<i>It feels like a car collision.</i>

1190
01:28:52.073 --> 01:28:55.243
<i>The vehicle gets drug a little bit
by the parachute if you have any wind,</i>


1191
01:28:55.326 --> 01:28:59.205
<i>and that jostles the crew around a bit,
and then everything gets quiet.</i>


1192
01:29:00.623 --> 01:29:02.250
<i>Absolutely quiet.</i>

1193
01:29:04.585 --> 01:29:06.504
<i>You start to smell the smoke
from the rockets.</i>


1194
01:29:06.587 --> 01:29:08.548
<i>You smell the grass outside.</i>

1195
01:29:08.673 --> 01:29:09.715
<i>You look out the window</i>

1196
01:29:09.841 --> 01:29:13.302
<i>and you can see the brown of the dirt
and the green of the grass,</i>


1197
01:29:13.428 --> 01:29:15.763
<i>and you know you're back on Earth.</i>

1198
01:29:17.515 --> 01:29:20.309
We sat there
trying to talk to people on the radio,


1199
01:29:20.393 --> 01:29:21.894
and we weren't able to reach anybody.

1200
01:29:21.978 --> 01:29:24.730
After being there about 30 minutes,
we decided we should get out,


1201
01:29:24.814 --> 01:29:26.691
and Nikolai reached up
and opened the hatch


1202
01:29:26.774 --> 01:29:28.151
and crawled out of the spacecraft,

1203
01:29:28.234 --> 01:29:31.279
and I followed him after that,
and Don came third.


1204
01:29:34.407 --> 01:29:38.244
[Mike] <i>We finally get there</i>
<i>after six hours to the landing site.</i>


1205
01:29:38.369 --> 01:29:45.376
I see Ken and Nikolai and Don
sitting outside of the <i>Soyuz.</i>


1206
01:29:45.501 --> 01:29:49.338
There are little yellow buttercups
and daisies out there,


1207
01:29:49.463 --> 01:29:51.132
and it's just rolling plains.

1208
01:29:51.257 --> 01:29:53.885
<i>I think there are wild horses out there
on that plain.</i>


1209
01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:59.015
I said, "Well, how are you feeling?"
"We feel really tired, really weak."


1210
01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:01.350
I said, "What were the G's you had
during the entry?"


1211
01:30:01.475 --> 01:30:03.603
"Eight G's!" I said, "Really?"

1212
01:30:03.728 --> 01:30:07.190
So we kind of get them
into the helicopter.


1213
01:30:07.315 --> 01:30:08.608
And Don wants to lie down.

1214
01:30:08.691 --> 01:30:10.985
So he's lying down on the floor.
There's not much room.


1215
01:30:11.068 --> 01:30:13.863
Ken's kind of propped up
against a fuel tank in this helicopter,


1216
01:30:13.946 --> 01:30:15.948
no straps, nothing like that.

1217
01:30:16.073 --> 01:30:21.412
And he says, "Don't forget that."
I go, "What?" He says, "That big sack."


1218
01:30:21.537 --> 01:30:24.457
He said, "We didn't know if we were ever
gonna get our stuff back.


1219
01:30:24.582 --> 01:30:27.919
So we've got all of Don's films
and camera magazines."


1220
01:30:28.044 --> 01:30:33.883
And I picked it
up and it was like

1221
01:30:34.008 --> 01:30:36.886
I said, "How did you put this
in the <i>Soyuz?"</i>


1222
01:30:38.429 --> 01:30:42.475
And Ken said, "Don
had it on his lap."

1223
01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:45.561
Eight G's. Eight gravities.

1224
01:30:45.686 --> 01:30:51.901
Multiply that times 20 kilos,
that's 160 kilos on Don's chest.


1225
01:30:52.026 --> 01:30:56.239
I said, "You've had aâ€¦ How could you
have put that on Don's chest?"


1226
01:30:56.364 --> 01:31:00.076
So, anyway, poor Don was kind of looking
a bit worse for wear


1227
01:31:00.201 --> 01:31:02.495
from that journey back to Earth.

1228

[groans] I wave to the camera.

1229
01:31:07.833 --> 01:31:10.503
[Ken] We knew it was coming,
and so we were prepared for the G's.


1230
01:31:10.628 --> 01:31:12.922
In fact, at the point
where we saw it coming, we said,


1231
01:31:13.047 --> 01:31:15.299
"Okay, guys, let's get strapped down
in your seats,


1232
01:31:15.383 --> 01:31:17.677
'cause it's about to get fun, fast."

1233
01:31:17.802 --> 01:31:21.639
In fact, Nikolai was great.
He says, "This is gonna be fun."


1234
01:31:21.764 --> 01:31:23.224
- He was great.
- Nikolai said that?


1235
01:31:23.349 --> 01:31:25.059
He was like a cheerleader
all the way down,


1236
01:31:25.184 --> 01:31:26.936
and we're all straining against the G.

[grunts]

1238
01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:32.984
It wasâ€¦ quite an experience.

[laughter]

1240
01:31:34.568 --> 01:31:38.030
It's great that we had a chance
to ride in a vehicle


1241
01:31:38.155 --> 01:31:40.783
that was on its first flight
into the atmosphere.


1242
01:31:40.908 --> 01:31:43.160
And so I feel really lucky.

Very successful landing.

1247
01:31:54.505 --> 01:31:57.717
How does Ken look?
How excited is he to be back?


1248
01:31:57.842 --> 01:31:58.884
He looks great.

1249
01:31:59.010 --> 01:32:02.972
He looks exactly the same
as when he left, maybe a little thinner.


1250
01:32:03.097 --> 01:32:06.934
<i>And when I first saw him, it was like
the six months had just gone away.</i>


1251
01:32:07.059 --> 01:32:09.770
<i>He's eager to see our kids
when we get back to Houston</i>


1252
01:32:09.895 --> 01:32:14.942
<i>and we're really excited about that.
The boys are dying to see him.</i>

What do you think
it will be most remembered for?


1256
01:32:25.119 --> 01:32:26.871
I think their flight showed

1257
01:32:26.996 --> 01:32:32.710
what an incredible team NASA has become
with their partners.


1258
01:32:32.835 --> 01:32:35.421
So much of this flight
was not as planned,


1259
01:32:35.546 --> 01:32:38.591
and it's just amazing
and it just clicked.

1427

1429
01:44:32.471 --> 01:44:36.433
<i>â™ª Life can be so unkind â™ª</i>

1430
01:44:39.394 --> 01:44:43.940
<i>â™ª I will be found

1431
01:44:46.193 --> 01:44:49.654
<i>â™ª Where there'll be no one around â™ª</i>

1432
01:44:50.113 --> 01:44:53.283

<i>My name is Tim Peake,</i>

1441
01:45:52.717 --> 01:45:55.846
<i>and I'm an astronaut
with the European Space Agency.</i>


1442
01:45:59.850 --> 01:46:03.353
<i>I grew up in Westbourne,
which is a small village in West Sussex.</i>


1443
01:46:03.478 --> 01:46:05.105
<i>We had beautiful night skies.</i>

1444
01:46:05.230 --> 01:46:08.567
<i>I would, you know, often go out at night
and just look up at the stars,</i>


1445
01:46:08.692 --> 01:46:11.611
<i>and really ask myself the big questions</i>

1446
01:46:11.736 --> 01:46:14.698
about our place in the universe
and how we got here,


1447
01:46:14.823 --> 01:46:17.784
and what created the universe,
and where it's going.


1448
01:46:21.496 --> 01:46:23.582
<i>The ability to actually
go up there and travel,</i>


1449
01:46:23.707 --> 01:46:26.251
<i>to see what's out there
beyond the boundaries,</i>


1450
01:46:26.376 --> 01:46:28.211
<i>was definitely a dream.</i>

1451
01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:32.841
- [Tim] Okay, I'm coming out.
- [Tim Kopra] Okay.


1452
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:36.887
[Reid Wiseman] <i>Hey, Tim, it's really cool</i>
<i>seeing that Union Jack go outside,</i>


1453
01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:39.181
<i>since it's explored all over the world,</i>

1454
01:46:39.264 --> 01:46:40.932
<i>now it's explored space.</i>

1455
01:46:41.016 --> 01:46:43.977
[Tim] <i>It's great to be wearing it.</i>

1456
01:46:44.644 --> 01:46:45.854
<i>A huge privilege.</i>

1457
01:46:46.605 --> 01:46:47.939
<i>A proud moment.</i>

1458
01:46:50.025 --> 01:46:51.484
[man] <i>Gentlemen, looking great.</i>

1459
01:46:51.610 --> 01:46:54.196
<i>Glad to see you both out there together
on the tip of the world.</i>


1460
01:46:57.199 --> 01:46:59.701
[Tim] <i>We thought it very important</i>
<i>to include our children</i>


1461
01:46:59.784 --> 01:47:01.661
<i>in everything that was going on,</i>

1462
01:47:01.786 --> 01:47:04.623
<i>so they felt very much
a part of that process.</i>


1463
01:47:04.748 --> 01:47:06.625
[boy] <i>Hello, Daddy.</i>

1464
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:08.919
<i>They were there in Kazakhstan
on launch day.</i>


1465
01:47:09.044 --> 01:47:13.298
[reporter] Tim's wife, Rebecca, beaming
with pride. Not a trace of nerves.


1466
01:47:13.423 --> 01:47:16.968
Will you ever be able to look
at the stars in the same way again?


1467
01:47:17.093 --> 01:47:19.554
It'll give us something extra
to look at, that's for sure,


1468
01:47:19.679 --> 01:47:22.974
now that we know Daddy's up there,
so, yeah,


1469
01:47:23.099 --> 01:47:26.937
we'll have something else to look out
for in the night sky, so it'll be great.


1470
01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:29.981
[Tim] <i>I got to see them just before</i>
<i>getting onto the bus as well,</i>


1471
01:47:30.106 --> 01:47:31.191
<i>to the launch pad.</i>

1472
01:47:38.698 --> 01:47:43.578
<i>By the time you actually say goodbye
to your family and go to the launch pad,</i>


1473
01:47:43.703 --> 01:47:45.956
there's a moment there
where you realize,


1474
01:47:46.081 --> 01:47:48.416
<i>"Okay, this is happening now."</i>

1475
01:47:48.541 --> 01:47:53.213
<i>And for me, it was a real flick
of a switch in terms of mental focus.</i>


1476
01:47:53.338 --> 01:47:55.590
Ten, nine, eightâ€¦

1477
01:47:55.715 --> 01:47:57.884
[Tim] You realize,
"This is it for six months.


1478
01:47:57.968 --> 01:48:00.887
Get into the right frame of mind,

1479
01:48:01.012 --> 01:48:03.181
<i>because what you're going to do
is quite remarkable."</i>


1480
01:48:03.306 --> 01:48:05.225
One!

1481
01:48:10.563 --> 01:48:11.606
Hey!

1482
01:48:14.442 --> 01:48:16.861
Bye, Daddy! Bye!

1483
01:48:39.968 --> 01:48:43.179
[Tim] <i>Nothing can really prepare you</i>
<i>for that feeling of weightlessness</i>


1484
01:48:43.305 --> 01:48:46.057
<i>and how to move your body around.
You feel very clumsy at first.</i>


1485
01:48:46.182 --> 01:48:50.520
<i>Your arms and legs are not moving
how you would expect them to,</i>


1486
01:48:50.645 --> 01:48:53.690
<i>and you have to use your muscles
in a different way to control yourself.</i>


1487
01:48:53.815 --> 01:48:56.443
This could be the worst idea
I've ever had.


1488
01:48:56.568 --> 01:48:59.321
- [laughs]
- Come on. You can do better than that.


1489
01:48:59.446 --> 01:49:02.198
Okay, so, yeah, I'll just go into a ball
and start spinning,


1490
01:49:02.324 --> 01:49:06.619
and then if you wanna
just keep me going round, andâ€¦


1491
01:49:07.412 --> 01:49:10.790
- Shall I keep you on axis too?
- Yeah, yeah. On axis, that's cool.


1492
01:49:11.791 --> 01:49:13.877
Let's go for it. That's good.

1493
01:49:14.002 --> 01:49:18.089
That's really fast from my point of view,
but it's not making me feel sick.


1494
01:49:19.090 --> 01:49:22.844
<i>The space station is, first
and foremost, a scientific laboratory.</i>


1495
01:49:22.969 --> 01:49:26.890
When you change gravity,
you get some quite remarkable results


1496
01:49:27.015 --> 01:49:28.933
in many of the experiments
that we're doing.


1497
01:49:29.059 --> 01:49:33.313
If you think that all life on Earth
has evolved over billions of years


1498
01:49:33.438 --> 01:49:35.231
in a one
-G environment,

1499
01:49:35.357 --> 01:49:36.900
put them into weightlessness,

1500
01:49:37.025 --> 01:49:40.862
we know straightaway
that the human body changes remarkably


1501
01:49:40.987 --> 01:49:43.531
just in the first five weeks in space.

1502
01:49:43.656 --> 01:49:47.577
Our immune system changes,
our cardiovascular system changes,


1503
01:49:47.702 --> 01:49:52.165
our blood volume changes, our skin ages
differently, our eyesight changes.


1504
01:49:52.290 --> 01:49:56.586
And that just goes to show
what gravity is doing here on Earth


1505
01:49:56.711 --> 01:49:58.630
<i>and what happens when you remove it.</i>

1506
01:49:59.381 --> 01:50:01.049
Okay, I'll see if I canâ€¦

1507
01:50:01.174 --> 01:50:03.885
I'm feeling dizzy.
I'll see how quickly it stops.


1508
01:50:05.512 --> 01:50:09.641
So definitely felt dizzy initially,
and now it's gone.


1509
01:50:09.766 --> 01:50:12.102
- No. It's that quick?
- Yeah. Yeah, completely normal.


1510
01:50:12.227 --> 01:50:13.520
- Amazing.
- Yeah.


1511
01:50:13.645 --> 01:50:14.646
[man] Crazy.

1512
01:50:18.900 --> 01:50:21.611
[Tim] <i>I was very lucky to have</i>
<i>the opportunity to go on a spacewalk.</i>


1513
01:50:21.736 --> 01:50:24.489
Myself and Tim Kopra, my NASA crewmate.

1514
01:50:24.614 --> 01:50:27.075
We had to go and repair
one of the solar panels.


1515
01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:28.493
<i>It was quite an important task</i>

1516
01:50:28.618 --> 01:50:31.454
<i>to get the full power back
up and running to the space station.</i>


1517

[commentator] <i>Tim Peake</i>

1520
01:50:42.257 --> 01:50:44.717
[Tim] <i>When you first go into the airlock,</i>

1521
01:50:44.843 --> 01:50:46.928
you're in there
with so much other equipment.


1522
01:50:47.053 --> 01:50:49.347
Everything is making an awful noise.

1523
01:50:49.472 --> 01:50:51.683
I mean, we have a lot of metal
on our spacesuits,


1524
01:50:51.808 --> 01:50:54.394
so lots of clips, lots of karabiners,

1525
01:50:54.519 --> 01:50:56.604
<i>tethers which are gonna
keep things attached.</i>


1526
01:50:56.729 --> 01:50:59.190
<i>Everything is clunking around,
making a racket.</i>


1527
01:50:59.315 --> 01:51:03.278
<i>As the airlock starts to depressurize
and we go to vacuum,</i>


1528
01:51:03.403 --> 01:51:06.698
<i>you notice a lot of that noise
starting to disappear.</i>


1529
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:22.630
We still hear things because they're
being transmitted through our spacesuit,


1530
01:51:22.755 --> 01:51:26.384
but, for example, you can get
two metal clips in front of your helmet


1531
01:51:26.509 --> 01:51:29.762
and knock them together
and then you won't hear anything at all.


1532
01:51:29.888 --> 01:51:32.807
<i>The noise that you have
is just a gentle hum of a fan</i>


1533
01:51:32.932 --> 01:51:36.603
<i>blowing air over the back of our heads
through our helmets.</i>


1534
01:51:39.481 --> 01:51:40.607
<i>Dropping out of the airlock</i>

1535
01:51:40.732 --> 01:51:46.488
<i>and just seeing Earth beneath my feet
for the first time was wonderful.</i>


1536
01:51:47.197 --> 01:51:50.241
<i>It's a very calm environment,
a very serene environment.</i>


1537
01:51:50.366 --> 01:51:53.453
It's not like a high-adrenaline,
extreme sport.


1538
01:51:53.578 --> 01:51:56.623
<i>It's one that's just of awe.</i>

1541
01:52:07.926 --> 01:52:12.388
[Tim] <i>I think spacewalking is probably</i>
<i>the highest risk activity that we do,</i>


1542
01:52:12.514 --> 01:52:14.516
<i>and it's actually
physically demanding as well.</i>


1543
01:52:14.641 --> 01:52:17.101
<i>It looks very graceful
when you see astronauts out there,</i>


1544
01:52:17.227 --> 01:52:19.979
<i>but inside the suit,
we're working very, very hard</i>


1545
01:52:20.104 --> 01:52:22.690
<i>with moving your fingers and your arms</i>

1546

<i>â™ª Solid ground â™ª</i>

1548
01:52:35.745 --> 01:52:38.331
One thing that was strange for me
as a pilot


1549
01:52:38.456 --> 01:52:42.627
is that in all my years of flying,
of course, if there's an emergency,


1550
01:52:42.752 --> 01:52:45.380
one of the first things
you're thinking about is landing.


1551
01:52:45.505 --> 01:52:48.091
<i>Where am I gonna land?
How am I going to land?</i>


1552
01:52:48.216 --> 01:52:53.096
<i>In space, that's not gonna happen.
You're up there for good.</i>

[Josh] <i>Our planet</i>
<i>is just a little blue marble</i>


1555
01:53:30.091 --> 01:53:32.385
<i>floating in the black void of space.</i>

1556
01:53:34.178 --> 01:53:40.852
<i>I make little planets that perhaps
remind one of how small our own Earth is</i>


1557
01:53:40.977 --> 01:53:44.230
<i>in relation to the greater universe.</i>

1558
01:53:45.857 --> 01:53:49.068
Some kind of a star-base there.

1559
01:53:53.906 --> 01:53:56.117
And sometimes just cities.

1560
01:53:58.661 --> 01:54:02.373
People actually give us a hard time
because he makes glass planets


1561
01:54:02.498 --> 01:54:05.001

- [Cady] <i>Bye.</i>


1568
01:54:25.813 --> 01:54:29.108
We could not call Cady,
but she called us.


1569
01:54:29.233 --> 01:54:32.278
I think she called us
every single night she was in orbit


1570
01:54:32.403 --> 01:54:34.572
except the night before she came back.

1571
01:54:35.281 --> 01:54:37.283
It was amazing to have her call us.

1572
01:54:37.408 --> 01:54:41.579
We'd talk for a few minutes and then
we'd go back, if it was a clear night,


1573
01:54:41.704 --> 01:54:46.501
we'd walk out onto the back porch
and watch her just blaze across the sky.


1574
01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:51.923
[Jamey] <i>She would read me,</i>
<i>like, bedtime stories,</i>


1575
01:54:52.048 --> 01:54:55.885
or I would just sort of talk to her
in my room about my day, you know.


1576
01:54:56.010 --> 01:55:01.599
It was definitely really tough
to not be able to talk in the same way,


1577
01:55:01.724 --> 01:55:05.436
and that whenever I needed something,
I would call my mom and be, like,


1578
01:55:05.561 --> 01:55:08.189
"Mom, I can't find my pants.
Where are my pants?"


1579
01:55:08.314 --> 01:55:10.149
But now that she was on the station,

1580
01:55:10.274 --> 01:55:12.944
it was, like, "Sweetie,
I don't know where your pants are,


1581
01:55:13.027 --> 01:55:15.613
<i>because I haven't been there
for four months," you know.</i>


1582
01:55:16.614 --> 01:55:18.157
<i>People ask me, you know, like,</i>

1583
01:55:18.282 --> 01:55:20.284
<i>"What is it like to have your mom
as an astronaut?"</i>


1584
01:55:20.410 --> 01:55:23.079
<i>And I'll be, like,
"Well, I mean, it's just Mom."</i>


1585
01:55:24.914 --> 01:55:28.793
[Cady] <i>I look out at the stars</i>
<i>and I see so many stars and planets</i>


1586
01:55:28.918 --> 01:55:31.921

we have a place in the universe,</i>


1587
01:55:32.046 --> 01:55:35.091
<i>and it's our job to explore that place.</i>

1588
01:55:36.801 --> 01:55:38.428
We need to bring up our children

1589
01:55:38.553 --> 01:55:42.223
to recognize and celebrate
the differences among us


1590
01:55:42.348 --> 01:55:45.643
and realize that it is
bringing those differences to a team


1591
01:55:45.768 --> 01:55:50.273
that allows us to pursue and succeed
in large endeavors,


1592
01:55:50.398 --> 01:55:52.358
like having it become normal

1593
01:55:52.483 --> 01:55:55.987
that somebody's mom
lives on the space station.

<i>â™ª In the wee small

1597
01:56:14.589 --> 01:56:16.799
It's very interesting
when you overfly places


1598
01:56:16.924 --> 01:56:18.426
that you have a strong connection to.

1599

<i>You are high enough that you can embrace
with one look an entire country.</i>


1600
01:56:22.180 --> 01:56:25.475
<i>Like Italy, you can easily see
the whole of it.</i>


1601

<i>Everybody that I know

<i>I can kind of see them all.</i>

1603
01:56:36.152 --> 01:56:39.363
<i>We are flying around the Earth
once every 90 minutes.</i>


1604
01:56:39.489 --> 01:56:42.825
Every orbit
is like this embrace of the planet.


1605
01:56:44.077 --> 01:56:47.121
<i>There is no one place on the planet
that feels far away.</i>


1606
01:56:47.246 --> 01:56:49.624

1609
01:57:01.385 --> 01:57:04.180
[Samantha] <i>Even the strange situation</i>
<i>of thinking that, you know,</i>

1611
01:57:06.599 --> 01:57:08.476
and there's only six right now

1612
01:57:08.601 --> 01:57:11.395
that are not, you know,
confined to the surface,


1613
01:57:11.521 --> 01:57:13.439
and it happens to
be the six of us.

1614
01:57:18.611 --> 01:57:21.864
<i>I think by the end what I had
was a feeling of affection</i>


1615
01:57:21.989 --> 01:57:23.449
<i>for the planet as a whole.</i>

1616
01:57:23.574 --> 01:57:28.246
It almost makes you feel like
the sentinels that are guarding the Earth,


1617
01:57:28.371 --> 01:57:30.414
especially when you fly over it
at night, right?


1618
01:57:30.498 --> 01:57:32.667
You almost think, like,
people down there,


1619
01:57:32.792 --> 01:57:36.045
<i>you're looking over them
as they're sleeping.</i>


1620
01:57:36.170 --> 01:57:39.048
<i>You get that feeling of,
"Oh, gosh, you know, it's my planet,</i>


1621
01:57:39.173 --> 01:57:40.925
<i>I want to protect it."</i>

[Peggy] <i>One of the best parts</i>
<i>of being able</i>


1626
01:58:31.809 --> 01:58:36.814
<i>to look at Earth from space
is perspective.</i>


1627
01:58:36.939 --> 01:58:40.943
<i>Because you see that planet,
you see how valuable it is,</i>


1628
01:58:41.068 --> 01:58:44.238
<i>how tiny-thin that atmosphere is,</i>

1629
01:58:44.363 --> 01:58:49.452
<i>and that's where all of the humanity
that we know about, anyway, lives on.</i>


1630
01:58:49.577 --> 01:58:51.370
<i>And then you look out to the stars</i>

1631
01:58:51.495 --> 01:58:56.959
<i>and you see thousands and thousands
and thousands of stars,</i>


1632
01:58:57.084 --> 01:59:01.380
and recognize
that we are just one galaxy


1633
01:59:01.505 --> 01:59:05.468
and that there are
billions of galaxies out there


1634
01:59:05.593 --> 01:59:07.929
that have maybe even more stars than us.

1635
01:59:08.638 --> 01:59:10.890
<i>It makes me sure
that there is other life out there.</i>


1636
01:59:11.015 --> 01:59:16.646
It may not look like us, or, you know,
be like us in any form or fashion,


1637
01:59:16.771 --> 01:59:18.814
but there's going to be life out there.

1638
01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:23.152
<i>There's just too many choices,
too many chances to be had.</i>


1639
01:59:29.075 --> 01:59:32.787
I think what history will say
about the space station is going to be


1640
01:59:32.912 --> 01:59:36.958
that it was the first real demonstration
of international cooperation.


1641
01:59:37.083 --> 01:59:40.461
We put together pieces
that had never been put together,


1642
01:59:40.586 --> 01:59:44.423
we did it in low-Earth orbit,
going 17,500 miles an hour,


1643
01:59:44.548 --> 01:59:48.344
<i>and that technical cooperation
overcomes differences</i>


1644
01:59:48.469 --> 01:59:52.556
<i>in culture, in religions or beliefs.</i>

1645
01:59:52.682 --> 01:59:54.850
We overcame all of that
and came together


1646
01:59:54.976 --> 01:59:57.186
to build something really special.

1647
01:59:57.311 --> 02:00:01.482
<i>I think one of the most memorable times
on the spacewalk,</i>


1648
02:00:01.607 --> 02:00:05.444
<i>I was doing a baseband
signal processor change-out.</i>


1649
02:00:05.569 --> 02:00:10.950
I pulled the box out, and the back side
of the container that housed the box


1650
02:00:11.075 --> 02:00:15.037
was this mirror reflective substance,

1651
02:00:15.162 --> 02:00:18.749
and I saw myself in a spacesuit

1652
02:00:18.874 --> 02:00:20.793
with the Earth behind me.

1653
02:00:20.918 --> 02:00:26.007
I was, like, "Hey, I'm an astronaut.
The real thing!"


1654
02:00:26.632 --> 02:00:28.801
<i>Not bad for a girl from Iowa.</i>

1655
02:00:32.888 --> 02:00:35.057
<i>I would go back
to space in a heartbeat.</i>

1656
02:00:35.182 --> 02:00:37.935
<i>I met my radiation limits with NASA,</i>

1657
02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:40.646
so I'll have to find somebody else
that'll fly me.


1658

[Scott] <i>Seeing the Earth from space,</i>

1660
02:00:48.863 --> 02:00:51.490
<i>and seeing the planet
without political borders,</i>


1661
02:00:51.615 --> 02:00:54.285
<i>you get an enhanced sense</i>

1662
02:00:54.410 --> 02:00:59.832
<i>that we are all in this thing
that we call humanity together.</i>


1663
02:00:59.957 --> 02:01:03.836
You know, we're all part
of the same team, Team Earth.


1664
02:01:07.381 --> 02:01:10.760
<i>One of the first times I looked at
the Earth I was, like, kind of puzzled.</i>


1665
02:01:10.885 --> 02:01:14.180
<i>I was like, "Hey, what's that thin film
over the surface?"</i>


1666
02:01:14.305 --> 02:01:16.640
<i>And then you quickly realize,
that's our atmosphere.</i>


1667
02:01:16.766 --> 02:01:18.601
When you look down on the planet,

1668
02:01:18.684 --> 02:01:22.480
our atmosphere looks like a contact lens
over somebody's eyeball,


1669
02:01:22.605 --> 02:01:25.107
<i>like this very, very fragile thing.</i>

1670
02:01:25.232 --> 02:01:28.319
<i>And then you see
how certain parts of the Earth</i>


1671
02:01:28.444 --> 02:01:32.698
are almost always covered in pollution.
Noticeable changes in the rainforest.


1672
02:01:32.823 --> 02:01:38.704
I mean, it really makes you, you know,
wanna take care of the planet.


1673
02:01:38.829 --> 02:01:40.081
We're all not going to Mars.

1674
02:01:40.206 --> 02:01:45.127
Mars is not the place that we go
after we destroy this planet.


1675
02:01:45.252 --> 02:01:46.629
That's not gonna work.

1676
02:01:58.808 --> 02:02:00.976
<i>This was built
by an international partnership.</i>


1677
02:02:01.102 --> 02:02:05.523
Fifteen different countries,
different languages, different cultures,


1678
02:02:06.357 --> 02:02:08.526
different technical ways
of doing things.


1679
02:02:08.609 --> 02:02:10.736
This is like the hardest thing
we've ever done.


1680
02:02:10.861 --> 02:02:12.696
Maybe harder than going to the Moon.

1681
02:02:12.822 --> 02:02:19.286
<i>That alone proves
that if we have a dream,</i>


1682
02:02:19.412 --> 02:02:22.706
if we have a goal,
if we work together, work as a team,


1683
02:02:22.832 --> 02:02:25.501

The fact that we've now learned
to go higher than the atmosphere


1689
02:02:46.105 --> 02:02:51.610
is probably a step as crucial
