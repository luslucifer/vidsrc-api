<i>…advances in science and technology.</i>


2
00:00:42.038 --> 00:00:46.751
<i>Opportunities and jobs will multiply
as we cross new thresholds of knowledge</i>


3
00:00:46.876 --> 00:00:49.045
<i>and reach deeper into the unknown.</i>

4
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.509
<i>Nowhere is this more important
than our next frontier, space.</i>


5
00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:58.763
Tonight, I am directing NASA to develop
a permanently manned space station,


6
00:00:58.888 --> 00:01:00.974
and to do it within a decade.

[girl] <i>I think I put, like,</i>
<i>a bell in there</i>


11
00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.886
<i>that was like, "Number One Dad."</i>

12
00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:42.140
<i>- Got the bell and the card too, yeah.</i>
- [girl] <i>Yeah.</i>


13

<i>we meet again in the quest for peace.</i>

20
00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:46.139
[man] <i>President Kennedy made a speech</i>
<i>to the United Nations in September of 1963</i>


21
00:03:46.597 --> 00:03:49.267
and made the offer
to bring the Soviet Union in


22
00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:52.103
and to make them
a part of the Apollo program.


23
00:03:53.313 --> 00:03:54.731
[JF Kennedy] <i>Finally, in a field</i>

24
00:03:54.814 --> 00:03:57.900
<i>where the United States
and the Soviet Union</i>


25
00:03:58.026 --> 00:04:02.155
<i>have a special capacity
in the field of space,</i>


26
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.033
<i>there is room for new cooperation,</i>

27
00:04:05.158 --> 00:04:07.201
<i>for further joint efforts</i>

28
00:04:07.285 --> 00:04:10.580
<i>in the regulation
and exploration of space.</i>


29
00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:16.502
<i>I include among these possibilities
a joint expedition to the Moon.</i>


30
00:04:17.128 --> 00:04:20.173
<i>Space offers no problems of sovereignty.</i>

31
00:04:20.298 --> 00:04:24.010
<i>Why, therefore,
should man's first flight to the Moon</i>


32
00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:26.846
<i>be a matter of national competition?</i>

33
00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:30.183
November of that year,
he wrote a memo to NASA


34
00:04:30.308 --> 00:04:33.186
<i>telling them he would like to have them
come back in two weeks</i>


35
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:38.399
<i>and tell them why the Soviet Union
should not be a part of Apollo.</i>


36
00:04:44.864 --> 00:04:49.035
<i>President Kennedy was killed
on the 22nd of November,</i>


37
00:04:49.118 --> 00:04:50.620
<i>and that never happened.</i>

38
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.792
<i>That vision that Kennedy had
of working together as partners</i>


39
00:04:55.917 --> 00:04:59.629
finally materialized
and is happening today.


40
00:04:59.754 --> 00:05:02.757
<i>That is the space station
we're flying right now.</i>


41
00:05:14.977 --> 00:05:17.814
[man] <i>There has never been any other</i>
<i>collaborative engineering project</i>


42
00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:20.983
<i>of this scope, size or challenge,
in my opinion.</i>


43
00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.071
<i>You are basically taking
pieces of hardware</i>


44
00:05:25.196 --> 00:05:27.865
<i>that may have been built
thousands of miles apart,</i>


45
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.285
<i>that had never been in the same room,
never touched each other.</i>


46
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.331
<i>Then you have to put them together
in space, in a vacuum,</i>


47
00:05:35.456 --> 00:05:37.375
<i>going at 18,000 miles an hour,</i>

48
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.460
<i>and they have to work
the first time they touch</i>


49
00:05:39.585 --> 00:05:42.964
<i>and not cause shocks or not leak
or have any other problems</i>


50
00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:45.633
<i>that of course are disastrous in space.</i>

51
00:05:45.758 --> 00:05:48.886
And they all worked. They all worked
when we put them together.


52
00:06:16.122 --> 00:06:17.498
<i>I flew three times in space.</i>

53
00:06:17.623 --> 00:06:21.377
<i>My third mission was as the commander
of the International Space Station</i>


54
00:06:21.502 --> 00:06:23.963
<i>early in its assembly in life.</i>

55
00:06:24.088 --> 00:06:27.216
<i>I was trained
for several possible spacewalks.</i>


56
00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:30.636
I ended up doing one
where we were attaching the cables


57
00:06:30.761 --> 00:06:33.598
to power up a new compartment
that had come up


58
00:06:33.723 --> 00:06:37.101
and test out a new piece of equipment
that the Russians had sent up there.


59
00:06:41.898 --> 00:06:43.733
<i>It's an all-day affair
to get ready for it.</i>


60
00:06:43.816 --> 00:06:45.484
<i>You have to have all the right equipment,</i>

61
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.029
<i>we have to prepare the station
as if we can't get back inside</i>


62
00:06:48.154 --> 00:06:49.614
<i>and have to come in a different way,</i>

63
00:06:49.697 --> 00:06:51.866
<i>and then you've got to go through
all the procedures</i>


64
00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:55.036
<i>to make sure your suit is working right
before you go outside.</i>


65
00:06:57.163 --> 00:07:00.416
It's a whole different experience
being on the outside of the station.


66
00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:03.169
We're here in Washington
and the Washington Monument's downtown.


67
00:07:03.294 --> 00:07:04.879
If you could imagine someone asks you

68
00:07:04.962 --> 00:07:09.050
to go out the windows at the top
of the monument and wash the outside.


69
00:07:09.175 --> 00:07:10.885
You open the window, you look out.

70
00:07:10.968 --> 00:07:13.137
There's nothing for 500 feet below you.

71
00:07:13.262 --> 00:07:16.307
So you open the hatch on the station.
You look out.


72
00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:20.353
<i>There's nothing except the atmosphere
for 250 miles below you.</i>


73
00:07:25.316 --> 00:07:28.986
<i>You'd be very careful about making sure
your tethers were always attached,</i>


74
00:07:29.111 --> 00:07:32.240
<i>because the Russian suit did not have
a little rocket pack on the back</i>


75
00:07:32.323 --> 00:07:34.200
<i>to fly you back if you got loose.</i>

76
00:07:41.624 --> 00:07:45.086
<i>About an hour or so in,
when I was feeling pretty comfortable,</i>


77
00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:47.296
I found myself on top of the station,

78
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:49.799
and so I put
my feet under the hand-holds

79
00:07:49.924 --> 00:07:52.718
and I stood up
on top of the station.

80
00:07:52.843 --> 00:07:56.847
Imagine standing on top of a 747
and holding on to just a little rope.


81
00:07:56.973 --> 00:07:58.891
That's what it was like standing up there,

82
00:07:59.016 --> 00:08:00.768
because you had the fuselage
of the station,


83
00:08:00.893 --> 00:08:02.687
you had the wings of the solar arrays,

84
00:08:02.812 --> 00:08:06.566
and you're on top of the world,
and it's all just unrolling beneath you.

our planet Earth.

88
00:08:31.716 --> 00:08:33.759
Beginning this year, 1998,

89

91
00:08:39.181 --> 00:08:43.978
With its vast expanses, scientists

92

<i>When I was a young boy,

<i>until I was through college
and in the navy,</i>

of common sense</i>

00:13:00.359 --> 00:13:02.403
<i>I was selected for that first crew.</i>

148
00:13:02.528 --> 00:13:06.448
<i>At first, Bill Shepherd and I
were the only ones there.</i>


149
00:13:06.574 --> 00:13:12.538
<i>Shortly afterwards,
Yuri Gidzenko was added to our crew.</i>


150
00:13:12.663 --> 00:13:14.206
<i>So that was the crew,</i>

151
00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:16.500
<i>Bill Shepherd, 
Yuri Gidzenko, and myself.</i>

152
00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:20.296
<i>We trained for nearly four years
for that first long-term mission.</i>


153
00:13:21.463 --> 00:13:22.840
<i>My name is Ginger Kerrick.</i>

154
00:13:22.965 --> 00:13:26.385
<i>I am currently a division chief
in the Flight Integration Division</i>


155
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:28.262
<i>at NASA Johnson Space Center.</i>

156
00:13:28.387 --> 00:13:31.432
<i>In the summer of '95,
I took my application</i>


157
00:13:31.557 --> 00:13:34.977
<i>and marched it down to the astronaut
selection office, turned it in.</i>


158
00:13:35.102 --> 00:13:40.232
They had received over 3,000 applicants
and had selected 120 to interview,


159
00:13:40.357 --> 00:13:42.276
and I was one of the 120.

160
00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:47.740
<i>I was 26 years old, and I thought,
"Oh, my gosh, my dream has come true."</i>


161
00:13:47.865 --> 00:13:50.159
<i>But when we went through interview week,</i>

162
00:13:50.284 --> 00:13:55.122
they did medical tests
and they found that I had kidney stones,


163
00:13:55.247 --> 00:13:58.000
and there was a new medical
disqualification enacted that year


164
00:13:58.125 --> 00:14:01.128
that if your body shows the ability
to form a single stone,


165
00:14:01.253 --> 00:14:04.089
it is a lifetime disqualification
from consideration.


166
00:14:04.214 --> 00:14:09.178
So I was devastated,
but I had started this new job


167
00:14:09.303 --> 00:14:12.306
where I got to teach astronauts
in the Mission Operations Directorate,


168
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:15.434
and I thought,
well, maybe astronaut wasn't for me.


169
00:14:15.559 --> 00:14:19.855
Maybe there's another path
that I was destined to take.


170
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.524
Maybe I'm 26 years old,
and I don't have everything figured out,


171
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.153
so how about I be open-minded
and see where this leads?


172
00:15:12.324 --> 00:15:15.285
Do you wanna go through these procedures
or do you want a general tour?


173
00:15:15.411 --> 00:15:18.747
- General tour would be excellent.
- Okay, let's start up here.


174
00:15:18.872 --> 00:15:21.375
[Ginger] <i>I was assigned</i>
<i>to support the first crew</i>


175
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.627
<i>that was getting ready to fly on board</i>

176
00:15:23.752 --> 00:15:27.381
the yet-to-be-constructed
International Space Station.


177
00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:30.300
So I got assigned
to Captain William Shepherd,


178
00:15:30.426 --> 00:15:33.345
<i>Sergei Krikalev, and Yuri Gidzenko.</i>

179
00:15:36.056 --> 00:15:38.684
[Ginger] Here's the person
who's going to live in there.


180
00:15:38.809 --> 00:15:41.061
[Bill] Sergei, clean up your room.

181
00:15:42.563 --> 00:15:45.315
Open the door and throw everything out.

182
00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:47.276
[Ginger] <i>Those guys were great.</i>

183
00:15:47.401 --> 00:15:51.196
<i>From an age perspective,
Yuri was more my age,</i>


184
00:15:51.321 --> 00:15:54.324
<i>Sergei was about the age
of my older brother,</i>


185
00:15:54.450 --> 00:15:57.995
<i>and Shep was 20 years older
and kind of like a father figure.</i>


186
00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:02.499
So managing those three personalities
took a unique skill set.


187
00:16:03.208 --> 00:16:04.960
[Bill] <i>This was a new vehicle.</i>

188
00:16:05.085 --> 00:16:08.255
<i>It had components
from 15 different countries.</i>


189
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.760
<i>The pieces were not gonna come together
until they met each other in orbit.</i>


190
00:16:12.885 --> 00:16:17.139
<i>Many of the techniques and procedures
we needed to operate it</i>


191
00:16:17.264 --> 00:16:18.599
<i>had not been written yet.</i>

192
00:16:18.724 --> 00:16:23.228
So our training was very much
"fly by the seat of your pants."


193
00:16:26.065 --> 00:16:28.609
[Sergei in Russian] <i>The training</i>
<i>was intense and unusual,</i>


194
00:16:28.734 --> 00:16:29.902
<i>even by modern standards.</i>

195
00:16:30.027 --> 00:16:35.449
The level of our training
was well above average,


196
00:16:35.574 --> 00:16:37.451
<i>because we studied a lot of things</i>

197
00:16:37.576 --> 00:16:40.537
<i>just in case there's an emergency
we cannot predict.</i>


198
00:16:41.955 --> 00:16:46.001
<i>We trained both in Houston
and here in Star City.</i>


199
00:16:46.126 --> 00:16:50.047
<i>It was a very interesting and friendly</i>

200
00:16:50.172 --> 00:16:52.800
experience exchange, information exchange,

201
00:16:52.925 --> 00:16:55.469
<i>emotional exchange, impressions exchange,</i>

202
00:16:55.594 --> 00:16:59.765
<i>because everyone could learn
something new.</i>


203
00:17:06.855 --> 00:17:10.109
[Ginger] <i>It was a wonderful experience,</i>

204
00:17:10.234 --> 00:17:13.278
<i>and if I had never watched the news,
I would never have suspected</i>


205
00:17:13.403 --> 00:17:16.824
<i>that there would be any antagonism
between Russia and the US,</i>


206
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:18.826
<i>based on my experience.</i>

207
00:17:18.951 --> 00:17:23.664
<i>Both of us have been in competition
since the early '60s,</i>


208
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:27.376
<i>trying to get to space,
the old space race,</i>


209
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:30.546
<i>but now we recognize that if we're gonna
go beyond low-Earth orbit,</i>


210
00:17:30.671 --> 00:17:32.923
<i>if we're gonna go
to the Moon or Mars,</i>

211
00:17:33.048 --> 00:17:35.968
<i>the only way to do that
is to do it together.</i>


212
00:17:44.309 --> 00:17:48.230
[Bill] <i>When we did land survival, we did</i>
<i>it in the winter outside of Moscow,</i>


213
00:17:48.355 --> 00:17:49.815
<i>and it was very wet and cold.</i>

214
00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:52.526
<i>We were in a boilerplate capsule,
as if we had just landed,</i>


215
00:17:52.651 --> 00:17:54.653
<i>we got out in our survival suits,</i>

216
00:17:54.778 --> 00:17:57.948
<i>and we had to build a little camp
and then survive.</i>


217
00:17:58.073 --> 00:18:02.077
<i>It was an extremely good experience
to bond the crew,</i>


218
00:18:02.202 --> 00:18:04.621
<i>and for time for us
to really get to know each other</i>


219
00:18:04.746 --> 00:18:09.585
<i>and contribute to what each of us
could offer as strengths and weaknesses.</i>


220
00:18:19.511 --> 00:18:21.346
[Bill] <i>We've been here for two days.</i>

221
00:18:21.471 --> 00:18:24.349
<i>Our launch is three days away, on Tuesday.</i>

222
00:18:24.474 --> 00:18:28.520
Everything in the vehicle looks
ready to go. Crew's well trained.


223
00:18:28.645 --> 00:18:32.107
We've been ready for probably a year
to go fly in space.


224
00:18:32.232 --> 00:18:34.776
It's just kind of a quiet time,

225
00:18:34.902 --> 00:18:38.572
thinking about everything we have to do
once we start flying,


226
00:18:38.697 --> 00:18:41.366
and Tuesday morning, we'll be ready.

227
00:18:41.491 --> 00:18:43.202
[interviewer] Beth, any thoughts?

228
00:18:43.327 --> 00:18:47.372
Just still, I think, hard to believe
that we're actually here,


229
00:18:47.497 --> 00:18:54.338
and just looking forward
to watching a great launch, so…


230
00:18:54.463 --> 00:18:57.966
[Bill] <i>We launched</i>
<i>on the 31st of October, 2000.</i>


231
00:18:58.091 --> 00:19:02.638
<i>We're out in Baikonur
way out in the desert in Kazakhstan.</i>


232
00:19:02.763 --> 00:19:06.600
<i>We sign our names
to the door of the room that we're in.</i>


233
00:19:06.725 --> 00:19:08.727
<i>I drew a little picture of Space Station.</i>

234
00:19:08.852 --> 00:19:10.479
[commentator] <i>Bill Shepherd's now joined</i>

235
00:19:10.604 --> 00:19:13.357
<i>by Johnson Space Center Director,
Mr. George Abbey.</i>


236
00:19:13.482 --> 00:19:15.984
<i>This is just before
the crew members were set</i>


237
00:19:16.109 --> 00:19:20.072
<i>to head over to the suit-up room
this morning shortly after wake-up.</i>


238
00:19:20.197 --> 00:19:21.740
[Bill] <i>We have a little breakfast,</i>

239
00:19:21.865 --> 00:19:25.869
<i>and then we go out
to the launch pad in a bus.</i>


240
00:19:25.994 --> 00:19:28.330
[commentator] <i>Bill Shepherd,</i>
<i>the commander of Expedition 1,</i>


241
00:19:28.455 --> 00:19:33.961
<i>along with Yuri Gidzenko
and Sergei Krikalev, now boarding a bus.</i>


242
00:19:34.086 --> 00:19:37.422
<i>The crew members will again head over
to the suit-up room.</i>


243
00:19:37.547 --> 00:19:41.009
[Bill] <i>The Russian approach to rules</i>
<i>is often quite different than the US,</i>


244
00:19:41.134 --> 00:19:44.972
<i>and that's one of the things
you get to appreciate sometimes.</i>


245
00:19:47.391 --> 00:19:52.020
In the United States,
we have a very regimented procedure


246
00:19:52.145 --> 00:19:55.607
for how you deal with friends and family
right before the launch.


247
00:19:55.732 --> 00:20:01.029
I waved goodbye to my wife
about two hours before we launched,


248
00:20:01.154 --> 00:20:04.574
<i>and then we're driving away in the bus,
and I saw her through the window.</i>


249
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.788
But then right as we're getting ready
to go out to the rocket,


250
00:20:09.913 --> 00:20:12.624
she surprised me from behind.

251
00:20:12.749 --> 00:20:14.334
Whoa! This was…

252
00:20:14.459 --> 00:20:17.713
<i>It was great, but it was just
kind of an unexpected moment</i>


253
00:20:17.838 --> 00:20:20.632
<i>that you would not
find in the US program.</i>

254

[commentator] <i>Bill Shepherd, on the left…</i>
<i>on the right of the commander.</i>


255
00:20:26.388 --> 00:20:28.015
<i>Now heading to the launch pad.</i>

256
00:20:42.863 --> 00:20:47.326
[Ginger] <i>I was in Baikonur, Kazakhstan,</i>
<i>and as soon as they shut the hatch,</i>


257
00:20:47.451 --> 00:20:49.202
I started hyperventilating,

258
00:20:49.328 --> 00:20:54.291
because I felt like
my brother and my dad, basically,


259
00:20:54.416 --> 00:20:58.712
were locked on a rocket,
and I couldn't process that.


260
00:20:58.837 --> 00:21:01.757
And one of the Russian generals got me

261
00:21:01.882 --> 00:21:04.885
and he's moving me through the crowd,
and he says…


262
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:06.845
[speaks Russian]

263
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.931
That means, "It's the mother of the crew."

264
00:21:10.057 --> 00:21:13.685
And he was trying to part the crowd
so I could see my crew on video,


265
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:15.771
<i>and it made me feel a lot better.</i>

266
00:21:17.439 --> 00:21:20.859
We became a family, and we all still
stay in touch to this day,


267
00:21:20.984 --> 00:21:23.111
so it was a wonderful experience.

[Bill] <i>The day, it was very foggy.</i>

270
00:21:29.368 --> 00:21:31.828
<i>We wouldn't have launched
in the United States</i>


271
00:21:31.953 --> 00:21:33.955
<i>because you need
a little bit of visibility,</i>


272
00:21:34.081 --> 00:21:38.085
<i>which we didn't have that day
in Kazakhstan,</i>


273
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.837

it felt… I could feel it here.

It was this culmination of the actual
physical event that was going on

the last four years of my life

with these people.

Then he was selected
to join a cosmonaut group


436
00:33:28.336 --> 00:33:34.258

in 1978.

443
00:33:56.781 --> 00:34:00.785
<i>and maybe that's why I didn't dream
of becoming a cosmonaut as a child.</i>


444
00:34:00.868 --> 00:34:07.834
<i>This profession seemed so heroic
and so difficult to me.</i>


445
00:34:10.336 --> 00:34:14.090
<i>When I grew up,
I made the conscious decision</i>


446
00:34:14.215 --> 00:34:19.053
to take on the responsibility
and accept the risks.


447

<i>It was strange</i>

448
00:34:27.562 --> 00:34:32.400
<i>because my father
was the commanding officer</i>


449
00:34:32.525 --> 00:34:39.490

of the candidates
selected for the physical.


451
00:34:43.536 --> 00:34:45.371
So he came home one night
with a question,


452
00:34:45.496 --> 00:34:48.457
<i>"Have you decided
to become a cosmonaut?"</i>


453
00:34:48.583 --> 00:34:51.460

454

<i>about me wanting to be a cosmonaut.</i>

455

for them, to put it mildly.


456

<i>He came to all three of my take-offs.</i>

457
00:35:06.642 --> 00:35:11.105
It's a complicated mix of feelings,
but of positive feelings,


458
00:35:12.523 --> 00:35:18.154
because you train very hard,

and he walked with me to the lift.

463
00:35:42.845 --> 00:35:48.434

Space Station for docking on Friday.</i>


580
00:43:58.006 --> 00:44:00.384
[Scott] <i>It looks like the space shuttle</i>
<i>lifts off slowly.</i>


581
00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:03.011
<i>When you're inside of it,
there is nothing slow about that.</i>


582
00:44:03.095 --> 00:44:07.850
<i>It's seven million pounds of thrust
instantly on your back</i>


583
00:44:07.975 --> 00:44:11.687
<i>and you feel like
you can feel every pound of it.</i>


584
00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:15.357

<i>One minute, 30 seconds into the flight.</i>

[Scott] <i>You know you are</i>
<i>in this incredibly complex machine</i>

00:44:24.908 --> 00:44:29.037
<i>that is operating
at really the limits of our ability</i>

590
00:44:35.502 --> 00:44:36.962
<i>It is absolutely crazy.</i>

610
00:46:22.859 --> 00:46:27.322
<i>Even when I was a kid,

<i>Glass is just sand.
It's part of the Earth.</i>


612
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:36.873
<i>When it's hot, glass is alive.</i>

613
00:46:36.999 --> 00:46:39.084
<i>It has an inner light.</i>

614
00:46:40.002 --> 00:46:43.755
<i>It is a weird twist of fate
that I was making planets</i>


615
00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:48.260
<i>and making space-related artwork
long before Cady and I met.</i>

<i>As it goes higher up into the sky,
the light gets brighter,</i>

this little, bright pinpoint of light.</i>

<i>I'm an astronaut who lived on

642
00:48:28.944 --> 00:48:34.199
<i>My dad worked on the Sealab program,
where men first lived under the sea,</i>


643
00:48:34.324 --> 00:48:39.037
<i>and I think it became normal to me
that it just was part of life,</i>


644
00:48:39.162 --> 00:48:43.250
<i>that people would live in places
that not many people lived.</i>


645
00:48:43.375 --> 00:48:45.711
The bottom of the ocean
was part of our world,


646
00:48:45.836 --> 00:48:47.671
we just hadn't been there yet.

647
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:59.850
<i>I loved being underwater
and having it be effortless,</i>


648
00:48:59.975 --> 00:49:02.811
<i>where you could breathe
and you could see,</i>


649
00:49:02.936 --> 00:49:07.232
<i>and I felt like I was in somebody else's
world and I got to explore it.</i>


650
00:49:18.994 --> 00:49:25.751
One of my favorite places
on the space station is our cupola.


651
00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.714
It is amazing up here.

652
00:49:32.382 --> 00:49:34.760
Windows on all sides.

653
00:49:36.928 --> 00:49:39.389
<i>When I found out
that I got accepted as an astronaut,</i>


654
00:49:39.514 --> 00:49:44.895
I had been dating a really nice guy
who lived in Western Massachusetts


655
00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.273
that I had met by basically
calling a wrong phone number.


656
00:49:48.398 --> 00:49:52.819
One night, the phone rang
and I answered the phone, and I said,


657
00:49:52.944 --> 00:49:54.988
[in Russian accent]
"Hello. What do you want?"


658
00:49:55.113 --> 00:49:58.909
And this perfectly nice woman said,
"Is this Peter?"


659
00:49:59.034 --> 00:50:00.702
And I said, "No, this is not Peter.

660
00:50:00.827 --> 00:50:05.916
My name is Olga Isnitchko
Eavorskayagoopdamehamatalliaihgatana."


661
00:50:06.041 --> 00:50:09.878
And she said, "I'm so sorry.
I thought you were Peter Masters.


662
00:50:10.003 --> 00:50:11.338
I'm looking for his wife, Amy."

663
00:50:11.463 --> 00:50:14.090
And when she said that,
I knew who she was looking for,


664
00:50:14.216 --> 00:50:18.053
because Amy had worked
in my studio years before.


665
00:50:18.178 --> 00:50:20.096
And so I said,
"Well, if you want to find Amy,


666
00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:23.308
you have to look
in the telephone directory,


667
00:50:23.433 --> 00:50:25.602
but when you get Amy on the phone,

668
00:50:25.727 --> 00:50:30.649
you must say hello from Olga Isnitchko
Eavorskayagoopdamehamatalliaihga."


669
00:50:30.774 --> 00:50:34.277
She was so polite,
and I just kept pulling her leg.


670
00:50:34.402 --> 00:50:38.281
And so I made her practice this name
over and over and over again,


671
00:50:38.406 --> 00:50:41.535
and she finally got
it, and I hung up.

672
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.621
But when she got her friend Amy
on the phone, she said,


673
00:50:44.746 --> 00:50:46.039
"There's this really weird man

674
00:50:46.164 --> 00:50:48.875
at the place where you worked,
you used to work."


675
00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.295
And Amy just cracked up and said,

676
00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:55.590
"That's Josh.
He disguises his voice at night.


677
00:50:55.715 --> 00:50:58.802
He hates… He doesn't wanna get
an answering machine."


678
00:50:58.927 --> 00:51:03.390
And so Cady decided to call me back.

679
00:51:03.515 --> 00:51:06.643
And so she called me back
with a Russian accent,


680
00:51:06.768 --> 00:51:09.729
and she said she was from Russian KGB

681
00:51:09.855 --> 00:51:12.023
and there had been numerous reports
of glass-breaking.


682
00:51:12.148 --> 00:51:15.485
And I said,
"I'm not Russian. I'm Bulgarian."


683
00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:17.946
And she said,
"We do them too, and you're history."


684
00:51:18.572 --> 00:51:23.159
<i>When we met, it was obvious to me
that we should be together.</i>


685
00:51:23.285 --> 00:51:26.913
<i>It took her a long time
to come around to that viewpoint.</i>


686
00:51:27.706 --> 00:51:29.666
When you tell people
that you live in Houston


687
00:51:29.791 --> 00:51:32.669
and your boyfriend
lives in Western Massachusetts,


688
00:51:32.794 --> 00:51:36.131
they look at you, like,
"Well, that's gonna last."


689
00:51:36.256 --> 00:51:39.134
And so we invented a new word
which was "sweetheart,"


690
00:51:39.259 --> 00:51:42.262
which seemed somehow more long-term.

691
00:51:42.387 --> 00:51:46.641
But I was really glad
that I sort of already knew the person


692
00:51:46.766 --> 00:51:49.769
I was gonna spend
the rest of my life with.


693
00:51:49.895 --> 00:51:53.481
<i>Before I applied, before, there was
sort of this aspect of this job</i>


694
00:51:53.607 --> 00:51:56.443
<i>that's hard for people
to get their arms around.</i>


695
00:51:56.568 --> 00:51:58.528
<i>"What does it mean?
What does it mean for her?</i>


696
00:51:58.653 --> 00:52:01.323
<i>What does it mean for me?
What's our life gonna be like?"</i>


697
00:52:01.448 --> 00:52:03.867
It was really nice
to have already met somebody


698
00:52:03.992 --> 00:52:07.787
that already seemed to love
all those things about me.


699
00:52:07.913 --> 00:52:10.290
[Josh] <i>When Cady</i>
<i>was accepted as an astronaut,</i>


700
00:52:10.373 --> 00:52:11.583
<i>the first thing that happened</i>

701
00:52:11.708 --> 00:52:16.087
<i>was that you have to show up to work
at Johnson Space Center in Houston.</i>


702
00:52:16.212 --> 00:52:19.299
<i>And so when Jamey was born,</i>

703
00:52:19.424 --> 00:52:22.135
we knew that either
Jamey was going to have to travel,


704
00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:25.263
or, because I have a glass studio here,

705
00:52:25.388 --> 00:52:29.309
<i>it turned out that I became
the prime parent and Cady would travel,</i>


706
00:52:29.434 --> 00:52:34.564
and I've always understood
that I'm gonna be the prime parent.


707
00:52:35.607 --> 00:52:40.278
<i>When Cady got first assigned
even to her first mission,</i>


708
00:52:40.403 --> 00:52:43.782
I was pretty worried
about what was gonna happen to her,


709
00:52:43.907 --> 00:52:47.118
whether she was gonna be safe,
whether it was gonna be okay,


710
00:52:47.243 --> 00:52:51.706
until I was kind of an emotional wreck.

711
00:52:51.831 --> 00:52:55.794
But then it occurred to me that
there are literally thousands of people


712
00:52:55.919 --> 00:52:59.339
<i>who are concerned
with her safety and well-being,</i>


713
00:52:59.464 --> 00:53:03.760
<i>and nothing that I'm doing,
nothing, no amount of worry,</i>


714
00:53:03.885 --> 00:53:09.683
no amount of stress on my part
was gonna help one way or the other.


715
00:53:09.808 --> 00:53:13.812
And I also thought about the fact
that Cady took this job


716
00:53:13.937 --> 00:53:18.984
<i>because, well, she wanted to do
that kind of exploration,</i>


717
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:22.362
<i>she also knew full well
the dangers involved.</i>


718
00:53:22.487 --> 00:53:27.492
And she's completely…
I don't think she wants to die,


719
00:53:27.617 --> 00:53:33.081
but I think she's willing to make
that sacrifice if that's the way it works.


720
00:53:33.206 --> 00:53:37.752
And I just thought, "Well,
if my sweetheart is willing to do that,


721
00:53:37.877 --> 00:53:40.296
then I should just let go there."

722
00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:42.340
It's gonna fine,
or it's not gonna be fine,


723
00:53:42.465 --> 00:53:46.970
but nothing that I'm gonna do or say
is gonna make any difference.


724
00:53:47.095 --> 00:53:52.892
And that works right until
you get to the, "Ten, nine, eight…"


725
00:53:53.018 --> 00:53:56.146
And then, of course,
all of that's out the window.


726
00:53:56.271 --> 00:53:57.856
You're completely…

727
00:54:02.402 --> 00:54:09.367
There's just this flow of worry
and pride and frightened emotion,


728
00:54:09.492 --> 00:54:12.162
and then the rocket goes off

729
00:54:12.287 --> 00:54:15.874
and about eight minutes later,
they're in space.


730
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:28.720
Bye, Cady.

731
00:54:48.281 --> 00:54:50.700
[interviewer] <i>Josh,</i>
<i>Cady's ticket to ride is behind you</i>


732
00:54:50.825 --> 00:54:53.161
<i>here on the launch pad
at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.</i>


733
00:54:53.286 --> 00:54:57.373
<i>Your thoughts as you saw
this whole process. Amazing for you?</i>


734
00:54:57.499 --> 00:55:00.126
[Josh] <i>Just a whole cascade</i>
<i>of thoughts, really,</i>


735
00:55:00.251 --> 00:55:07.217
<i>that this is, for Cady, the culmination
of a dream, a lifetime of preparation.</i>


736
00:55:08.718 --> 00:55:15.100
This is the spot where Yuri Gagarin
left from and where <i>Sputnik</i> left from,


737
00:55:15.225 --> 00:55:17.977
and where my sweetheart is going to go.

738
00:55:18.103 --> 00:55:19.354
It's very significant.

739
00:55:19.479 --> 00:55:22.232
<i>I think she's ready,
although, knowing my wife,</i>


740
00:55:22.357 --> 00:55:26.236
<i>she'll be packing right to the last
instant before she goes on board.</i>


741
00:55:35.662 --> 00:55:39.374
<i>The morning that she took off,</i>

742
00:55:39.499 --> 00:55:42.752
<i>we woke up in the middle of the night,
it must have been 2:00 in the morning,</i>


743
00:55:42.877 --> 00:55:44.629
<i>and we drove to the launch site.</i>

744
00:55:44.754 --> 00:55:47.090
<i>It was really cold.</i>

745
00:55:50.677 --> 00:55:53.721
<i>We were a mile away,</i>

746
00:55:53.847 --> 00:55:58.726
<i>but it was just sort of a cement platform
where we viewed the launch,</i>


747
00:55:58.852 --> 00:56:04.107
<i>and it was so cold
that no amount of clothing helped.</i>


748
00:56:04.232 --> 00:56:07.193
The cold just cut right through you.

749

[commentator] <i>Here on the ground</i>

753
00:56:19.956 --> 00:56:26.504
It was really challenging for Jamey
at launch because I think that sudden,


754
00:56:26.629 --> 00:56:29.174
"I understand what Dad's
been talking about all this time.


755
00:56:29.299 --> 00:56:33.011
That's a rocket.
That's my mom. She's gone."


756
00:56:33.136 --> 00:56:35.722
And there was
a flood of emotion for him,


757
00:56:35.847 --> 00:56:39.976
and, for me, I was concerned about him

758
00:56:40.059 --> 00:56:43.730
as much as I was concerned for Cady.

759
00:56:44.189 --> 00:56:46.900
And I realize that
he was turning to me

760
00:56:47.025 --> 00:56:51.154
and was kind of hanging on to me
and he was in tears.


761
00:57:24.062 --> 00:57:27.565
<i>Watching it go up
was profound for Jamey.</i>


762
00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:29.692
<i>I think he realized that…</i>

763
00:57:32.362 --> 00:57:34.656

<i>leaving behind her husband

766
00:57:44.165 --> 00:57:47.252

770

You know, I've gotten
so I feel actually right at home here,


771
00:57:58.221 --> 00:57:59.847
I think it's just like any other place,

772
00:57:59.973 --> 00:58:03.643
and then sometimes there's things
that remind me that we're in space.


773
00:58:04.435 --> 00:58:05.562
Like this.

774
00:58:06.813 --> 00:58:08.856
<i>- You know, you…</i>
- Take it.


775

for Cady up in space.</i>


776
00:58:13.361 --> 00:58:15.446
[Jamey] <i>I remember, like,</i>
<i>saying goodbye to my mom,</i>

like, seeing her walk out
of the sort of prep facility.


778
00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:24.789
And I was, like,
"Okay, like, this is it," you know.


779
00:58:24.914 --> 00:58:26.833
And I hadn't started crying quite then,

780
00:58:26.958 --> 00:58:30.044
but then when I saw the rocket
ascending into the sky,


781
00:58:30.169 --> 00:58:32.714
I was, like, "Wow, my mom isn't here."

782
00:58:32.839 --> 00:58:35.466
It really brought me to tears
'cause it was just, like,


783
00:58:35.592 --> 00:58:39.554
"Wow, my mom

<i>At the time,
there were no Japanese astronauts,</i>


792
00:59:39.155 --> 00:59:44.702

A one-week, two-week flight
can pass really quickly,

01:06:03.831 --> 01:06:07.334
<i>As we went over Maine,
we could see New York City</i>


863
01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.545
<i>and the smoke from the fires.</i>

864
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:11.964
<i>Our prayers and thoughts
go out to all the people there</i>


865
01:06:12.089 --> 01:06:13.758
<i>and everywhere else here.</i>

866
01:06:13.883 --> 01:06:17.553
<i>I'm looking up and down the east coast
to see if I can see anything else.</i>


867
01:06:20.222 --> 01:06:22.433
[woman] <i>Frank,</i>
<i>that's an accurate assessment.</i>


868
01:06:23.059 --> 01:06:26.562
[Frank] <i>All the contrails which normally</i>
<i>cover the country in a spider web</i>


869
01:06:26.687 --> 01:06:27.730
<i>had disappeared,</i>

870
01:06:27.855 --> 01:06:29.732
<i>because they had grounded
all the airplanes.</i>


871
01:06:29.857 --> 01:06:33.694
<i>That really brought it home that
this was a totally different world now.</i>


872
01:06:36.572 --> 01:06:40.701
They had had to evacuate the federal
facility where our mission control was


873
01:06:40.826 --> 01:06:43.079
and move them
to an undisclosed location,


874
01:06:43.204 --> 01:06:45.998
which I still don't know where it was.

875
01:06:46.123 --> 01:06:48.084
So we were operating
with Moscow primarily,


876
01:06:48.209 --> 01:06:50.044
<i>and they were
very supportive, sympathetic,</i>


877
01:06:50.169 --> 01:06:52.630
<i>and trying to give us
as much information as they could.</i>


878
01:06:52.713 --> 01:06:55.132
<i>Whenever one of their specials
would come on to talk to us</i>


879
01:06:55.216 --> 01:06:58.427
<i>about a system or an experiment
or whatever, they would frequently say,</i>


880
01:06:58.552 --> 01:07:01.388
"Where's Frank?",
you know, "How's Frank doing?"


881
01:07:03.766 --> 01:07:06.185
It was very meaningful,
'cause I knew them all by name,


882
01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:09.271
and they would express their condolences

883
01:07:09.396 --> 01:07:11.565
and they were really sorry
for what happened.


884
01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:15.277
Interesting thing is, 94 Russians
also died in the World Trade Center,


885
01:07:15.402 --> 01:07:17.113
and we had no idea, at that time,

886
01:07:17.238 --> 01:07:20.699
how many from overseas were there
and lost their lives.


887
01:07:20.825 --> 01:07:23.202
The next day,
I got a call from TJ Creamer,


888
01:07:23.327 --> 01:07:25.621
who was my support astronaut
on the ground, and he said,


889
01:07:25.746 --> 01:07:27.706
"Frank, I've got some bad news."

890
01:07:27.832 --> 01:07:31.043
And it turned out that my classmate
from the Naval Academy,


891
01:07:31.168 --> 01:07:33.712
who was classmates with Shep and myself,

892
01:07:33.838 --> 01:07:36.132
<i>was the captain
of American Airlines Flight 77</i>


893
01:07:36.257 --> 01:07:38.342
<i>that was crashed into the Pentagon.</i>

894
01:07:38.467 --> 01:07:41.220
<i>Chic was an F-4 pilot, like me,
he was an aerospace engineer,</i>


895
01:07:41.303 --> 01:07:44.265
<i>we had actually played in the drum
and bugle corps together for a while,</i>


896
01:07:44.348 --> 01:07:45.516
<i>so we were friends.</i>

897
01:07:45.641 --> 01:07:49.687
And so he had died in that crash.

898
01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:51.647
I could only imagine
what it was like for him.


899
01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:54.066
I didn't find out much
until after I returned


900
01:07:54.191 --> 01:07:56.193
about what the particulars were
of that flight,


901
01:07:56.318 --> 01:07:59.446
but I felt sure he had fought
as much as he could.


902
01:08:00.447 --> 01:08:01.699
<i>It really brought it home to me</i>

903
01:08:01.782 --> 01:08:04.451
<i>and it made it very personal
at that point.</i>


904
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:09.623
I would like to send a message
from the station down in memory of Chic


905
01:08:09.748 --> 01:08:12.626
and of all of our graduates who perished

906
01:08:12.751 --> 01:08:15.171
and of all the victims of this tragedy,

907
01:08:15.296 --> 01:08:18.132
something that has
never been done before from space.


908
01:08:18.257 --> 01:08:22.720
So I'd like to ask all of you to rise
for a moment of silence


909
01:08:22.845 --> 01:08:26.140
as we play something
from International Space Station Alpha.

<i>and I'm an astronaut
with the European Space Agency.</i>


944
01:11:59.937 --> 01:12:03.941
We had started out
with over 8,000 applicants,


945
01:12:04.066 --> 01:12:06.527
and then here we were,
after a year, only ten of us.


946
01:12:06.652 --> 01:12:09.238
Ten young Europeans
from different countries.


947
01:12:09.363 --> 01:12:11.323
At that point,
we were almost all in touch.


948
01:12:11.448 --> 01:12:13.367
There was going to be
a press conference,


949
01:12:13.492 --> 01:12:16.036
and the European Space Agency
was going to announce,


950
01:12:16.161 --> 01:12:19.164
"Here are our new astronauts."

951
01:12:19.289 --> 01:12:23.836
And two days before that, at nine o'clock
at night, we still had not heard.


952
01:12:23.961 --> 01:12:27.923
I mean, my level of tension
was way up there.


953
01:12:28.048 --> 01:12:31.135
I just felt
that I couldn't take it anymore.


954
01:12:31.260 --> 01:12:34.388
<i>And then all of a sudden,
there was this email, and it's like,</i>


955
01:12:34.513 --> 01:12:36.140
<i>"Dear Miss Cristoforetti…"</i>

956
01:12:36.265 --> 01:12:38.016
You just felt like
the universe had stopped


957
01:12:38.142 --> 01:12:41.311
and it turned back
and smiled at me at that time.


958
01:12:41.437 --> 01:12:45.315
<i>The fact that you are selected
as an astronaut is huge, you know.</i>


959
01:12:45.441 --> 01:12:48.444
<i>You're not any more
one of the thousands, ten thousands,</i>


960
01:12:48.569 --> 01:12:50.863
maybe millions of people
who dream of becoming astronauts.


961
01:12:50.988 --> 01:12:53.782
You actually are selected
to train as an astronaut.


962
01:12:53.907 --> 01:12:56.452
But then this new
phase of your life comes

963
01:12:56.577 --> 01:12:58.996
<i>when you're just waiting and hoping</i>

964
01:12:59.121 --> 01:13:02.291
<i>that this moment is going to come
and is going to come soon.</i>


965
01:13:04.334 --> 01:13:06.462
One of the greatest memories I have

966
01:13:06.587 --> 01:13:11.592
from the time leading up
to my space flight is being in Baikonur.


967
01:13:11.717 --> 01:13:15.220
That's where we launched from.
And you go to Baikonur twice.


968
01:13:15.345 --> 01:13:17.556
<i>You go to Baikonur
before your own launch,</i>


969
01:13:17.681 --> 01:13:19.600
<i>and you go to Baikonur
six months before,</i>


970
01:13:19.725 --> 01:13:21.810
when you are actually the back-up crew.

971
01:13:21.935 --> 01:13:24.938
So, you are, in theory, ready to fly
instead of the prime crew


972
01:13:25.063 --> 01:13:26.815
if the prime crew has an issue.

973
01:13:26.940 --> 01:13:30.777
And we were down there,
Terry, Anton and myself,


974
01:13:30.903 --> 01:13:35.949
<i>in May 2014, as the back-up crew,
and that was the most wonderful time.</i>


975
01:13:36.074 --> 01:13:38.577
We are usually allowed to go out
and have a jog


976
01:13:38.702 --> 01:13:40.621
with other people
who are in quarantine with us.


977
01:13:40.746 --> 01:13:44.791
We kind of bend the rules because
we'd just go out without any escort.


978
01:13:44.917 --> 01:13:48.378
And basically what I wanted to do,
I had a bottle with me,


979
01:13:48.504 --> 01:13:52.174
and I had put in
a picture of the three of us.


980
01:13:52.299 --> 01:13:55.302
We had signed thousands
of those pictures in the days before,


981
01:13:55.427 --> 01:13:57.429
and so I had grabbed one
with our signature,


982
01:13:57.554 --> 01:14:01.642
and I had added an email address
that I had just done for that purpose.


983
01:14:01.767 --> 01:14:03.810
And I thought,
"We'll just throw it in the river


984
01:14:03.894 --> 01:14:06.605
and then maybe
some mysterious inhabitant of the steppe


985
01:14:06.730 --> 01:14:08.190
one day will write back to us."

986
01:14:08.857 --> 01:14:10.192
We are about to come back

987
01:14:10.317 --> 01:14:15.447
and we realize a little bit upstream
there are, like, these wild horses,


988
01:14:15.572 --> 01:14:16.949
<i>such a beautiful image.</i>

989
01:14:17.074 --> 01:14:21.203
<i>There were probably, maybe

990
01:14:21.328 --> 01:14:23.455
<i>there were no people,
just the wild horses,</i>


991
01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.290
<i>and they had come
to drink at the river.</i>

992
01:14:25.415 --> 01:14:29.670
<i>And it was such a beautiful,
powerful scene, you know.</i>


993
01:14:29.795 --> 01:14:34.341
And for me it was just something
that brought me into the emotional mood


994
01:14:34.466 --> 01:14:37.803
of then watching the launch
in the night.


995

was a little bit different.

There was a lot of different meanings
to that for us.

01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:49.020

to our friends who are on <i>Columbia?"</i>

<i>sat in meetings with them,
talked to them in the hallways.</i>


1110
01:23:57.987 --> 01:24:00.698

"What's happened to them?" you know.</i>


1111
01:24:00.824 --> 01:24:03.284
<i>Is there any chance
that they made it through?</i>


1112
01:24:04.369 --> 01:24:08.081
Folks on the ground have been real good
about reducing our schedule


1113
01:24:08.206 --> 01:24:10.708
and we've had time
to grieve our friends.


1114
01:24:10.834 --> 01:24:12.335
And that was very important.

1115
01:24:12.418 --> 01:24:15.296
When you're up here this long,
you can't just bottle up your emotions


1116
01:24:15.421 --> 01:24:16.756
and focus all the time.

1117
01:24:16.881 --> 01:24:20.552
It's important for us to acknowledge
that the people on STS-107


1118
01:24:20.677 --> 01:24:23.346
were our friends,
that we had a connection with them,


1119
01:24:23.471 --> 01:24:25.348
and that we feel their loss.

1120
01:24:25.473 --> 01:24:29.686
The next impact to us was, "Well,
what does that mean for us to come home?"


1121
01:24:32.188 --> 01:24:34.607
<i>Since the space shuttles
were under review,</i>


1122
01:24:34.732 --> 01:24:37.485
we had to decide
when it would be safe to fly one again


1123
01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:40.363
and how to fly it safely.

1124
01:24:40.488 --> 01:24:43.241
The decision was made for us
to come home a different way,


1125
01:24:43.366 --> 01:24:46.619
to come home in a <i>Soyuz</i> spacecraft.

1126
01:24:46.744 --> 01:24:50.415
<i>So we're packing up gear
to be returned home aboard shuttles</i>


1127
01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:51.958
<i>when they start flying again.</i>

1128
01:24:52.083 --> 01:24:56.713
<i>We'll have some refresher training to do
over the next month and a half or so.</i>


1129
01:24:56.838 --> 01:24:58.506
<i>My family spent most of their time</i>

1130
01:24:58.631 --> 01:25:01.634
worrying about the people
that were affected on the ground,


1131
01:25:01.759 --> 01:25:05.889
the effect on the spouses
for the crew of <i>Columbia.</i>


1132
01:25:06.014 --> 01:25:09.225
But they also had a lot of inquiries
from different people


1133
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:13.354
wanting to know how they felt
with their husbands up in space,


1134
01:25:13.479 --> 01:25:15.440
knowing that it was a risky business.

1135
01:25:15.565 --> 01:25:18.151
Everybody wanted to know
what we thought about the risk.


1136
01:25:18.276 --> 01:25:22.197
Let me start by sort of comparing
what a <i>Soyuz</i> flight is like


1137
01:25:22.322 --> 01:25:25.533
compared to a return in a space shuttle.

1138
01:25:25.658 --> 01:25:28.912
<i>The space shuttle is a lot more
like flying on an airliner,</i>


1139
01:25:29.037 --> 01:25:33.082
<i>and the return from space is
very similar to flying on an airliner,</i>


1140
01:25:33.208 --> 01:25:34.626
<i>except you go from being weightless</i>

1141
01:25:34.751 --> 01:25:38.880
<i>to having your perceived weight be maybe
one and a half times your normal weight.</i>


1142
01:25:39.005 --> 01:25:43.134
<i>And then the final approach
is like a steep glide in an airliner</i>


1143
01:25:43.218 --> 01:25:44.552
<i>and you touch down on a runway.</i>

1144
01:25:44.636 --> 01:25:48.890
It feels very much like any touchdown
from an international flight.


1145
01:25:51.726 --> 01:25:56.773
<i>On a</i> Soyuz, <i>you get in, it's smaller,</i>
<i>everything is more compact.</i>

01:25:56.898 --> 01:25:59.108
<i>Instead of sitting up,
like you would on an airliner,</i>


1147
01:25:59.234 --> 01:26:02.737
<i>you're kind of laying on your back,
and it's a much quicker trip home.</i>


1148
01:26:02.862 --> 01:26:04.864
<i>It's only a few hours back to Earth</i>

1149
01:26:04.989 --> 01:26:08.409
<i>rather than a day and a half or two
in a space shuttle.</i>


1150
01:26:08.534 --> 01:26:10.495
It's a little bit more
like a carnival ride.


1151
01:26:11.913 --> 01:26:16.459
[man] <i>And Expedition 6</i>
<i>now officially on its way back home,</i>


1152
01:26:16.584 --> 01:26:19.921
<i>with landing a little more
than three hours from now.</i>


1153
01:26:22.215 --> 01:26:23.883
[Ken] <i>The flight gets most interesting</i>

1154
01:26:24.008 --> 01:26:26.386
<i>when you start to get down
into the atmosphere.</i>


1155
01:26:27.595 --> 01:26:30.265
<i>First thing you see
is some glowing light</i>


1156
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:33.518
<i>coming off the side of the capsule
and any other parts around it.</i>


1157
01:26:33.643 --> 01:26:35.895
<i>You see a bright orange glow
outside the windows.</i>


1158
01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.732
<i>You might see little droplets running
along the window that look like water</i>


1159
01:26:39.857 --> 01:26:43.027
<i>but are really something melted
on the spacecraft.</i>


1160
01:26:43.152 --> 01:26:45.154
[man] <i>At this point,</i>
<i>the crew should be feeling</i>


1161
01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.241
<i>the maximum G-load on the re-entry.</i>

1162
01:26:48.366 --> 01:26:50.243
[man speaks in Russian]

1163
01:26:53.037 --> 01:26:57.333
We realized that we were having
an off-nominal type of entry


1164
01:26:57.458 --> 01:26:58.960
called a ballistic descent.

1165
01:27:00.670 --> 01:27:02.964
Once you reach
the ballistic descent mode,


1166
01:27:03.089 --> 01:27:06.926
<i>there's not a lot for the crew
to interact with on the spacecraft,</i>


1167
01:27:07.051 --> 01:27:10.138
and so you have some spare moments
to think about what you're doing


1168
01:27:10.263 --> 01:27:13.891
and to realize how little control
you have over the situation,


1169
01:27:14.017 --> 01:27:16.269
how you're trusting the engineers
who designed


1170
01:27:16.394 --> 01:27:19.439
<i>and the technicians
who built that spacecraft,</i>


1171
01:27:19.564 --> 01:27:22.608
<i>and how everything's gotta work
if you're gonna survive.</i>


1172
01:27:38.833 --> 01:27:43.046
I'm in the helicopter with the chief
of the astronaut office, Bob Cabana,


1173
01:27:43.129 --> 01:27:46.090
<i>and they say, "We're in touch
with the crew. We're hearing the crew."</i>


1174
01:27:46.174 --> 01:27:47.842
But it was a very faint call.

1175
01:27:50.219 --> 01:27:52.472
<i>I could tell my boss
was really, really worried.</i>


1176
01:27:52.555 --> 01:27:54.891
<i>He said, "Why is the signal faint?
Can they hear them?"</i>


1177
01:27:54.974 --> 01:27:56.184
<i>I said, "They can't hear them.</i>

1178
01:27:56.309 --> 01:27:58.644
<i>They heard them on the radio
and then it disappeared."</i>


1179
01:27:59.228 --> 01:28:01.814
Bob Cabana was like,
"Oh, no, we've lost another crew."


1180
01:28:06.736 --> 01:28:09.072
<i>They said, "They did a ballistic entry."</i>

1181
01:28:09.197 --> 01:28:13.326
To mean they're 400 kilometers away,
off-course,


1182
01:28:13.451 --> 01:28:15.286
and not in the right place,
not where we are.


1183
01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:26.672
When the parachutes come out, you get
rocked all around, shaken, rotated.


1184
01:28:26.798 --> 01:28:28.299
<i>It feels pretty violent.</i>

1185
01:28:28.424 --> 01:28:31.344
<i>Again, that's where it feels
most like a carnival ride.</i>


1186
01:28:33.638 --> 01:28:35.098
<i>And then it gets peaceful,</i>

1187
01:28:35.223 --> 01:28:38.309
<i>and you coast and coast and coast down
underneath the parachutes.</i>


1188
01:28:45.733 --> 01:28:48.778
<i>There's sort of a big bang
as you hit the ground.</i>


1189
01:28:48.903 --> 01:28:50.863
<i>It feels like a car collision.</i>

1190
01:28:52.073 --> 01:28:55.243
<i>The vehicle gets drug a little bit
by the parachute if you have any wind,</i>


1191
01:28:55.326 --> 01:28:59.205
<i>and that jostles the crew around a bit,
and then everything gets quiet.</i>


1192
01:29:00.623 --> 01:29:02.250
<i>Absolutely quiet.</i>

1193
01:29:04.585 --> 01:29:06.504
<i>You start to smell the smoke
from the rockets.</i>


1194
01:29:06.587 --> 01:29:08.548
<i>You smell the grass outside.</i>

1195
01:29:08.673 --> 01:29:09.715
<i>You look out the window</i>

1196
01:29:09.841 --> 01:29:13.302
<i>and you can see the brown of the dirt
and the green of the grass,</i>


1197
01:29:13.428 --> 01:29:15.763
<i>and you know you're back on Earth.</i>

1198
01:29:17.515 --> 01:29:20.309
We sat there
trying to talk to people on the radio,


1199
01:29:20.393 --> 01:29:21.894
and we weren't able to reach anybody.

1200
01:29:21.978 --> 01:29:24.730
After being there about 30 minutes,
we decided we should get out,


1201
01:29:24.814 --> 01:29:26.691
and Nikolai reached up
and opened the hatch


1202
01:29:26.774 --> 01:29:28.151
and crawled out of the spacecraft,

1203
01:29:28.234 --> 01:29:31.279
and I followed him after that,
and Don came third.


1204
01:29:34.407 --> 01:29:38.244
[Mike] <i>We finally get there</i>
<i>after six hours to the landing site.</i>


1205
01:29:38.369 --> 01:29:45.376
I see Ken and Nikolai and Don
sitting outside of the <i>Soyuz.</i>


1206
01:29:45.501 --> 01:29:49.338
There are little yellow buttercups
and daisies out there,


1207
01:29:49.463 --> 01:29:51.132
and it's just rolling plains.

1208
01:29:51.257 --> 01:29:53.885
<i>I think there are wild horses out there
on that plain.</i>


1209
01:29:54.010 --> 01:29:59.015
I said, "Well, how are you feeling?"
"We feel really tired, really weak."


1210
01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:01.350
I said, "What were the G's you had
during the entry?"


1211
01:30:01.475 --> 01:30:03.603
"Eight G's!" I said, "Really?"

1212
01:30:03.728 --> 01:30:07.190
So we kind of get them
into the helicopter.


1213
01:30:07.315 --> 01:30:08.608
And Don wants to lie down.

1214
01:30:08.691 --> 01:30:10.985
So he's lying down on the floor.
There's not much room.


1215
01:30:11.068 --> 01:30:13.863
Ken's kind of propped up
against a fuel tank in this helicopter,


1216
01:30:13.946 --> 01:30:15.948
no straps, nothing like that.

1217
01:30:16.073 --> 01:30:21.412
And he says, "Don't forget that."
I go, "What?" He says, "That big sack."


1218
01:30:21.537 --> 01:30:24.457
He said, "We didn't know if we were ever
gonna get our stuff back.


1219
01:30:24.582 --> 01:30:27.919
So we've got all of Don's films
and camera magazines."


1220
01:30:28.044 --> 01:30:33.883
And I picked it
up and it was like

1221
01:30:34.008 --> 01:30:36.886
I said, "How did you put this
in the <i>Soyuz?"</i>


1222
01:30:38.429 --> 01:30:42.475
And Ken said, "Don
had it on his lap."

1223
01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:45.561
Eight G's. Eight gravities.

1224
01:30:45.686 --> 01:30:51.901
Multiply that times 20 kilos,
that's 160 kilos on Don's chest.


1225
01:30:52.026 --> 01:30:56.239
I said, "You've had a… How could you
have put that on Don's chest?"


1226
01:30:56.364 --> 01:31:00.076
So, anyway, poor Don was kind of looking
a bit worse for wear


1227
01:31:00.201 --> 01:31:02.495
from that journey back to Earth.

1228
01:31:02.954 --> 01:31:06.540
[groans] I wave to the camera.

1229
01:31:07.833 --> 01:31:10.503
[Ken] We knew it was coming,
and so we were prepared for the G's.


1230
01:31:10.628 --> 01:31:12.922
In fact, at the point
where we saw it coming, we said,


1231
01:31:13.047 --> 01:31:15.299
"Okay, guys, let's get strapped down
in your seats,


1232
01:31:15.383 --> 01:31:17.677
'cause it's about to get fun, fast."

1233
01:31:17.802 --> 01:31:21.639
In fact, Nikolai was great.
He says, "This is gonna be fun."


1234
01:31:21.764 --> 01:31:23.224
- He was great.
- Nikolai said that?


1235
01:31:23.349 --> 01:31:25.059
He was like a cheerleader
all the way down,


1236
01:31:25.184 --> 01:31:26.936
and we're all straining against the G.

[grunts]

1238
01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:32.984
It was… quite an experience.

[laughter]

1240
01:31:34.568 --> 01:31:38.030
It's great that we had a chance
to ride in a vehicle


1241
01:31:38.155 --> 01:31:40.783
that was on its first flight
into the atmosphere.


1242
01:31:40.908 --> 01:31:43.160
And so I feel really lucky.

1243
01:31:43.953 --> 01:31:46.163
- [interviewer] Well, there we are.
- That's two.

1246
01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.380
Very successful landing.

1247
01:31:54.505 --> 01:31:57.717
How does Ken look?
How excited is he to be back?


1248
01:31:57.842 --> 01:31:58.884
He looks great.

1249
01:31:59.010 --> 01:32:02.972
He looks exactly the same
as when he left, maybe a little thinner.


1250
01:32:03.097 --> 01:32:06.934
<i>And when I first saw him, it was like
the six months had just gone away.</i>


1251
01:32:07.059 --> 01:32:09.770
<i>He's eager to see our kids
when we get back to Houston</i>


1252
01:32:09.895 --> 01:32:14.942
<i>and we're really excited about that.
The boys are dying to see him.</i>

of Expedition 6?

What do you think
it will be most remembered for?


1256
01:32:25.119 --> 01:32:26.871
I think their flight showed

1257
01:32:26.996 --> 01:32:32.710
what an incredible team NASA has become
with their partners.


1258
01:32:32.835 --> 01:32:35.421
So much of this flight
was not as planned,


1259
01:32:35.546 --> 01:32:38.591
and it's just amazing
and it just clicked.


1260
01:32:38.716 --> 01:32:40.176
It's a great team.

"So, if you could get

<i>My name is Tim Peake,</i>

1441
01:45:52.717 --> 01:45:55.846
<i>and I'm an astronaut
with the European Space Agency.</i>


1442
01:45:59.850 --> 01:46:03.353
<i>I grew up in Westbourne,
which is a small village in West Sussex.</i>


1443
01:46:03.478 --> 01:46:05.105
<i>We had beautiful night skies.</i>

1444
01:46:05.230 --> 01:46:08.567
<i>I would, you know, often go out at night
and just look up at the stars,</i>


1445
01:46:08.692 --> 01:46:11.611
<i>and really ask myself the big questions</i>

1446
01:46:11.736 --> 01:46:14.698
about our place in the universe
and how we got here,


1447
01:46:14.823 --> 01:46:17.784
and what created the universe,
and where it's going.


1448
01:46:21.496 --> 01:46:23.582
<i>The ability to actually
go up there and travel,</i>


1449
01:46:23.707 --> 01:46:26.251
<i>to see what's out there
beyond the boundaries,</i>


1450
01:46:26.376 --> 01:46:28.211
<i>was definitely a dream.</i>

1451
01:46:30.380 --> 01:46:32.841
- [Tim] Okay, I'm coming out.
- [Tim Kopra] Okay.


1452
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:36.887
[Reid Wiseman] <i>Hey, Tim, it's really cool</i>
<i>seeing that Union Jack go outside,</i>


1453
01:46:36.970 --> 01:46:39.181
<i>since it's explored all over the world,</i>

1454
01:46:39.264 --> 01:46:40.932
<i>now it's explored space.</i>

1455
01:46:41.016 --> 01:46:43.977
[Tim] <i>It's great to be wearing it.</i>

1456
01:46:44.644 --> 01:46:45.854
<i>A huge privilege.</i>

1457
01:46:46.605 --> 01:46:47.939
<i>A proud moment.</i>

1458
01:46:50.025 --> 01:46:51.484
[man] <i>Gentlemen, looking great.</i>

1459
01:46:51.610 --> 01:46:54.196
<i>Glad to see you both out there together
on the tip of the world.</i>


1460
01:46:57.199 --> 01:46:59.701
[Tim] <i>We thought it very important</i>
<i>to include our children</i>


1461
01:46:59.784 --> 01:47:01.661
<i>in everything that was going on,</i>

1462
01:47:01.786 --> 01:47:04.623
<i>so they felt very much
a part of that process.</i>


1463
01:47:04.748 --> 01:47:06.625
[boy] <i>Hello, Daddy.</i>

1464
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:08.919
<i>They were there in Kazakhstan
on launch day.</i>


1465
01:47:09.044 --> 01:47:13.298
[reporter] Tim's wife, Rebecca, beaming
with pride. Not a trace of nerves.


1466
01:47:13.423 --> 01:47:16.968
Will you ever be able to look
at the stars in the same way again?


1467
01:47:17.093 --> 01:47:19.554
It'll give us something extra
to look at, that's for sure,


1468
01:47:19.679 --> 01:47:22.974
now that we know Daddy's up there,
so, yeah,


1469
01:47:23.099 --> 01:47:26.937
we'll have something else to look out
for in the night sky, so it'll be great.


1470
01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:29.981
[Tim] <i>I got to see them just before</i>
<i>getting onto the bus as well,</i>


1471
01:47:30.106 --> 01:47:31.191
<i>to the launch pad.</i>

1472
01:47:38.698 --> 01:47:43.578
<i>By the time you actually say goodbye
to your family and go to the launch pad,</i>


1473
01:47:43.703 --> 01:47:45.956
there's a moment there
where you realize,


1474
01:47:46.081 --> 01:47:48.416
<i>"Okay, this is happening now."</i>

1475
01:47:48.541 --> 01:47:53.213
<i>And for me, it was a real flick
of a switch in terms of mental focus.</i>


1476
01:47:53.338 --> 01:47:55.590
Ten, nine, eight…

1477
01:47:55.715 --> 01:47:57.884
[Tim] You realize,
"This is it for six months.


1478
01:47:57.968 --> 01:48:00.887
Get into the right frame of mind,

1479
01:48:01.012 --> 01:48:03.181
<i>because what you're going to do
is quite remarkable."</i>


1480
01:48:03.306 --> 01:48:05.225
One!

1481
01:48:10.563 --> 01:48:11.606
Hey!

1482
01:48:14.442 --> 01:48:16.861
Bye, Daddy! Bye!

1483
01:48:39.968 --> 01:48:43.179
[Tim] <i>Nothing can really prepare you</i>
<i>for that feeling of weightlessness</i>


1484
01:48:43.305 --> 01:48:46.057
<i>and how to move your body around.
You feel very clumsy at first.</i>


1485
01:48:46.182 --> 01:48:50.520
<i>Your arms and legs are not moving
how you would expect them to,</i>


1486
01:48:50.645 --> 01:48:53.690
<i>and you have to use your muscles
in a different way to control yourself.</i>


1487
01:48:53.815 --> 01:48:56.443
This could be the worst idea
I've ever had.


1488
01:48:56.568 --> 01:48:59.321
- [laughs]
- Come on. You can do better than that.


1489
01:48:59.446 --> 01:49:02.198
Okay, so, yeah, I'll just go into a ball
and start spinning,


1490
01:49:02.324 --> 01:49:06.619
and then if you wanna
just keep me going round, and…


1491
01:49:07.412 --> 01:49:10.790
- Shall I keep you on axis too?
- Yeah, yeah. On axis, that's cool.


1492
01:49:11.791 --> 01:49:13.877
Let's go for it. That's good.

1493
01:49:14.002 --> 01:49:18.089
That's really fast from my point of view,
but it's not making me feel sick.


1494
01:49:19.090 --> 01:49:22.844
<i>The space station is, first
and foremost, a scientific laboratory.</i>


1495
01:49:22.969 --> 01:49:26.890
When you change gravity,
you get some quite remarkable results


1496
01:49:27.015 --> 01:49:28.933
in many of the experiments
that we're doing.


1497
01:49:29.059 --> 01:49:33.313
If you think that all life on Earth
has evolved over billions of years


1498
01:49:33.438 --> 01:49:35.231
in a one
-G environment,

1499
01:49:35.357 --> 01:49:36.900
put them into weightlessness,

1500
01:49:37.025 --> 01:49:40.862
we know straightaway
that the human body changes remarkably


1501
01:49:40.987 --> 01:49:43.531
just in the first five weeks in space.

1502
01:49:43.656 --> 01:49:47.577
Our immune system changes,
our cardiovascular system changes,


1503
01:49:47.702 --> 01:49:52.165
our blood volume changes, our skin ages
differently, our eyesight changes.


1504
01:49:52.290 --> 01:49:56.586
And that just goes to show
what gravity is doing here on Earth


1505
01:49:56.711 --> 01:49:58.630
<i>and what happens when you remove it.</i>

1506
01:49:59.381 --> 01:50:01.049
Okay, I'll see if I can…

1507
01:50:01.174 --> 01:50:03.885
I'm feeling dizzy.
I'll see how quickly it stops.


1508
01:50:05.512 --> 01:50:09.641
So definitely felt dizzy initially,
and now it's gone.


1509
01:50:09.766 --> 01:50:12.102
- No. It's that quick?
- Yeah. Yeah, completely normal.


1510
01:50:12.227 --> 01:50:13.520
- Amazing.
- Yeah.


1511
01:50:13.645 --> 01:50:14.646
[man] Crazy.

1512

[Tim] <i>I was very lucky to have</i>
<i>the opportunity to go on a spacewalk.</i>

Myself and Tim Kopra, my NASA crewmate.

1514
01:50:24.614 --> 01:50:27.075
We had to go and repair
one of the solar panels.


1515

[Tim] <i>When you first go into the airlock,</i>

1521
01:50:44.843 --> 01:50:46.928
you're in there

1522
01:50:47.053 --> 01:50:49.347
Everything is making an awful noise.

1523
01:50:49.472 --> 01:50:51.683
I mean, we have a lot of metal
on our spacesuits,


1524
01:50:51.808 --> 01:50:54.394
so lots of clips, lots of karabiners,

1525
01:50:54.519 --> 01:50:56.604
<i>tethers which are gonna
keep things attached.</i>


1526
01:50:56.729 --> 01:50:59.190
<i>Everything is clunking around,
making a racket.</i>


1527
01:50:59.315 --> 01:51:03.278
<i>As the airlock starts to depressurize
and we go to vacuum,</i>


1528
01:51:03.403 --> 01:51:06.698
<i>you notice a lot of that noise
starting to disappear.</i>


1529
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:22.630
We still hear things because they're
being transmitted through our spacesuit,


1530
01:51:22.755 --> 01:51:26.384
but, for example, you can get
two metal clips in front of your helmet


1531
01:51:26.509 --> 01:51:29.762
and knock them together
and then you won't hear anything at all.


1532
01:51:29.888 --> 01:51:32.807
<i>The noise that you have
is just a gentle hum of a fan</i>

<i>It's a very calm environment,

1537

It was amazing to have her call us.

1572
01:54:37.408 --> 01:54:41.579
We'd talk for a few minutes and then
we'd go back, if it was a clear night,


1573
01:54:41.704 --> 01:54:46.501
we'd walk out onto the back porch
