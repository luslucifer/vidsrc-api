1
00:03:42.758 --> 00:03:43.884
Female.

2
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.178
They're on their way.

3
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:51.934
You go. I'll pick Alex up
and meet you at home.

Origins of Gender
by N. Kraken


5
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.888
- Hello.
- Hello.


6
00:04:32.475 --> 00:04:33.809
You haven't changed.

7
00:04:34.018 --> 00:04:35.645
Hello, Ramiro.

8
00:04:39.732 --> 00:04:41.901
Look at you, all grown up.

9
00:05:02.838 --> 00:05:03.881
Okay.

10
00:05:04.757 --> 00:05:06.258
- Did you get everything?
- Yes.


11
00:05:06.467 --> 00:05:07.551
Ramiro's reading the book.

12
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.637
I haven't spoken with Kraken.

13
00:05:09.804 --> 00:05:10.262
Why not?

14
00:05:10.471 --> 00:05:12.890
I'll find the time today.

15
00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:15.893
Ramiro didn't tell anybody,
did he?


16
00:05:16.644 --> 00:05:19.522
No, he didn't. Don't worry.
He's discreet.


17
00:05:45.297 --> 00:05:48.551
NO ENTRY

18
00:06:22.418 --> 00:06:24.003
Look at this place,
it's paradise.


19
00:06:24.253 --> 00:06:25.546
Alvaro!

20
00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:32.470
See how big he is?

21
00:06:32.845 --> 00:06:33.929
You don't remember me.

22
00:06:34.138 --> 00:06:36.348
He was too young. Come on.

23
00:06:36.557 --> 00:06:38.893
Hello! How are you?

24
00:06:39.602 --> 00:06:41.187
Welcome.

25
00:06:42.772 --> 00:06:44.190
Let me get that.

26
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.608
Thanks.

27
00:06:46.734 --> 00:06:49.361
- How was the trip?
- Good.


28
00:06:55.326 --> 00:06:56.786
Come in.

29
00:07:12.885 --> 00:07:15.513
Alvaro, come, it's here.

30
00:07:18.015 --> 00:07:20.351
Alex likes to take a nap
on this couch.


31
00:07:20.518 --> 00:07:21.769
It's cool in here.

32
00:07:21.977 --> 00:07:25.815
You'll share the bathroom.
To give your parents some privacy.


33
00:07:26.982 --> 00:07:29.527
- What's this?
- Homeopathy.


34
00:07:29.777 --> 00:07:33.030
That one is for people
who're afraid of being hurt.


35
00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:34.949
The fear of getting hurt.

36
00:07:56.262 --> 00:07:57.555
Hi.

37
00:08:01.684 --> 00:08:03.102
You hust had a wank.

38
00:08:03.352 --> 00:08:05.938
- What?
- There is your room.


39
00:08:06.146 --> 00:08:07.648
How did you know?

40
00:08:07.815 --> 00:08:09.567
I can tell.

41
00:08:10.818 --> 00:08:12.278
Do you jerk off too?

42
00:08:12.528 --> 00:08:14.947
Every day.

43
00:08:21.245 --> 00:08:23.372
I'd never been to Uruguay.

44
00:08:23.747 --> 00:08:26.417
We're talking about jerking off,
not Uruguay?


45
00:08:34.008 --> 00:08:35.259
How old are you?

46
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:36.844
Fifteen.

47
00:08:43.976 --> 00:08:46.896
I've never fucked anybody.
Would you like to?


48
00:08:47.146 --> 00:08:48.647
With whom?

49
00:08:48.856 --> 00:08:50.149
With me.

50
00:08:50.316 --> 00:08:51.901
With you?

51
00:09:13.797 --> 00:09:15.007
Alvaro do you want some?

52
00:09:15.174 --> 00:09:16.926
- I'm a vegeterian.
- Seriously?


53
00:09:17.176 --> 00:09:19.303
He won't touch a thing.

54
00:09:19.553 --> 00:09:22.014
I don't like trying anything new.

55
00:09:22.932 --> 00:09:24.058
Hi, honey!

56
00:09:25.893 --> 00:09:28.020
This is Alex. Erika...

57
00:09:28.187 --> 00:09:29.647
Hello!

58
00:09:30.522 --> 00:09:32.733
- Ramiro.
- Hello.


59
00:09:36.904 --> 00:09:38.697
You two have met, right?

60
00:09:42.701 --> 00:09:46.038
Your mum used to say
she'd have four daughters.


61
00:09:46.246 --> 00:09:49.083
We'd call her
a "Desperate Housewife".


62
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.253
So the desperate housewife
got scared along the way..


63
00:09:57.758 --> 00:09:59.677
- Do you go to school?
- I used to.


64
00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:01.512
What do you mean "used to"?

65
00:10:02.096 --> 00:10:03.681
I'm getting expelled on Monday.

66
00:10:03.847 --> 00:10:05.224
What happened?

67
00:10:05.391 --> 00:10:07.977
I punched Vando. 
I broke his nose.

68
00:10:10.938 --> 00:10:12.815
Why? What happened?

69
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.162
Who's Vando?

70
00:10:27.538 --> 00:10:29.498
Her best friend.

71
00:10:29.957 --> 00:10:33.877
Friend or boyfriend?
You don't do that to a friend.


72
00:11:34.229 --> 00:11:36.148
When will she speak to him?

73
00:11:37.608 --> 00:11:39.860
She said tomorrow.

74
00:13:16.415 --> 00:13:20.043
"In all vertebrates,
including the human being,


75
00:13:20.335 --> 00:13:22.045
the female sex is dominant

76
00:13:22.254 --> 00:13:26.175
in an evolutionary
and embryological sense."


77
00:13:59.208 --> 00:14:02.252
We should arrange
to meet Vando's parents


78
00:14:02.961 --> 00:14:04.796
to apologize.

79
00:14:05.005 --> 00:14:07.007
Apologize? Us?

80
00:14:07.216 --> 00:14:09.176
For breaking that asshole's nose?

81
00:14:09.384 --> 00:14:11.762
It's them who should apologize.

82
00:14:13.347 --> 00:14:14.932
He's Alex's best friend.

83
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.141
Was.

84
00:14:36.411 --> 00:14:38.622
Why didn't you tell me
he's a surgeon?


85
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:40.207
He's the best.

86
00:14:40.415 --> 00:14:42.125
Say who? Him?

87
00:14:42.334 --> 00:14:43.418
No. I did some research.

88
00:14:43.669 --> 00:14:45.879
Research?

89
00:14:46.088 --> 00:14:47.839
Since when?

90
00:14:48.257 --> 00:14:50.801
I'm not the enemy.

91
00:14:57.266 --> 00:14:58.850
She's not taking them anymore...

92
00:14:59.059 --> 00:15:00.352
Did you know?

93
00:15:01.812 --> 00:15:03.647
No. I didn't.

94
00:15:37.097 --> 00:15:39.016
- Do you like it?
- What?


95
00:15:39.474 --> 00:15:41.018
My house.

96
00:15:42.227 --> 00:15:43.353
Yes.

97
00:15:48.984 --> 00:15:50.819
Don't like to me.

98
00:16:13.133 --> 00:16:15.385
Do you like cutting people up?

99
00:16:18.096 --> 00:16:19.514
It's my job.

100
00:16:26.229 --> 00:16:27.606
Alex!

101
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:32.903
- Hurry up!
- Do you read me, Kraken?


102
00:16:33.111 --> 00:16:36.531
They're taking the turtles
to the port


103
00:16:36.782 --> 00:16:38.784
- Where are they?
- 10 miles offshore.


104
00:16:39.117 --> 00:16:40.535
I'm on my way.

105
00:16:59.763 --> 00:17:01.807
- Can I come?
- Climb in.


106
00:17:46.309 --> 00:17:48.270
One of them lost a front flipper.

107
00:17:53.692 --> 00:17:55.944
- Where did they show up?
- 10 miles offshore.


108
00:17:56.153 --> 00:17:58.155
They were following
a shoal of sprats.


109
00:17:58.363 --> 00:18:00.240
They were in the water
for 20 hours.


110
00:18:00.449 --> 00:18:01.700
Caught in a net.

111
00:18:01.867 --> 00:18:05.078
Poor things.
Can you identify them?


112
00:18:20.469 --> 00:18:21.595
Were there others?

113
00:18:22.554 --> 00:18:24.431
My son said there were.

114
00:18:25.891 --> 00:18:27.601
Where are they?

115
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.275
You have something for me?

116
00:18:36.776 --> 00:18:38.069
Nothing.

117
00:18:38.361 --> 00:18:39.529
Are you sure?

118
00:18:40.071 --> 00:18:41.990
Are you a biologist or a cop?

119
00:18:42.199 --> 00:18:45.535
You should come with an apology
rather than an attitude.


120
00:18:45.785 --> 00:18:49.247
My son was spitting blood.
She broke his nose.


121
00:18:49.623 --> 00:18:51.666
My wife wants to report it.

122
00:18:51.875 --> 00:18:54.753
She'd better not
come round here again.


123
00:19:03.929 --> 00:19:05.222
Wait, Alex.

124
00:19:06.806 --> 00:19:08.433
What are you looking at?

125
00:19:10.477 --> 00:19:12.771
Enough already!

126
00:19:14.814 --> 00:19:17.400
That's it, take her away.

127
00:19:17.609 --> 00:19:21.196
Too many endangered species
as it is.


128
00:19:32.749 --> 00:19:35.043
Your son is afraid of my daughter?

129
00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.836
- Your son's a traitor.
- Dad.


130
00:19:37.087 --> 00:19:39.631
- I won't allow...
- You won't allow what?


131
00:19:39.839 --> 00:19:43.218
She's capable
of breaking his nose again!


132
00:19:43.426 --> 00:19:44.553
She's just like me.

133
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:46.513
She's capable of doing it!

134
00:20:10.745 --> 00:20:12.330
Who did you tell?

135
00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:14.165
Just Vando.

136
00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.886
If I'm so special
why can't I talk about it?


137
00:20:57.334 --> 00:20:59.919
In the end, our fathers
are in the same business.


138
00:21:02.547 --> 00:21:03.715
Will it live?

139
00:21:03.923 --> 00:21:07.594
Yes. But it'll never go back
to the sea again.


140
00:21:10.639 --> 00:21:12.682
How many boob jobs
has your dad done?


141
00:21:12.891 --> 00:21:14.225
I don't know...

142
00:21:15.352 --> 00:21:16.686
You're a freak.

143
00:21:16.895 --> 00:21:18.104
So are you.

144
00:21:19.981 --> 00:21:22.233
I bet he's done thousands.

145
00:21:23.068 --> 00:21:24.903
- Have you ever been?
- Where?


146
00:21:25.111 --> 00:21:27.238
To surgery. To see the butchering.

147
00:21:27.447 --> 00:21:30.075
He doesn't butcher people.
He fixes them.


148
00:21:30.283 --> 00:21:34.579
He does tits and noses for money,
but he prefers the other stuff.


149
00:21:34.788 --> 00:21:35.914
Such as?

150
00:21:36.122 --> 00:21:38.375
I don't know, deformities...

151
00:21:38.583 --> 00:21:40.377
Guys born with eleven fingers.

152
00:21:40.585 --> 00:21:42.128
My dad takes off the extra one.

153
00:21:42.337 --> 00:21:43.630
And eats it.

154
00:21:43.838 --> 00:21:45.840
I'm serious. It's not a joke.

155
00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:49.219
You said that he didn't butcher bodies.

156
00:21:49.427 --> 00:21:52.222
Never mind. You don't get it.

157
00:22:37.183 --> 00:22:39.269
Do you like your parents?

158
00:22:40.854 --> 00:22:42.313
They're my parents.

159
00:22:42.981 --> 00:22:45.191
So? Do you like them?

160
00:22:46.609 --> 00:22:48.319
I guess.

161
00:22:51.781 --> 00:22:52.907
Thanks.

162
00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:00.540
I feel sorry for mine.
They're always waiting.


163
00:23:06.629 --> 00:23:08.548
Why did you hit him?

164
00:23:09.132 --> 00:23:11.050
He had it coming.

165
00:23:14.262 --> 00:23:16.514
Do you take Argentine pesos?

166
00:23:16.723 --> 00:23:18.558
- Yes.
- How much is it?


167
00:23:18.767 --> 00:23:20.310
18.

168
00:23:20.518 --> 00:23:21.895
He pays.

169
00:23:33.865 --> 00:23:35.200
Here you are.

170
00:23:39.537 --> 00:23:41.873
- Enjoy it.
- Thanks.


171
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.276
When you listen to music
in the street,


172
00:24:10.485 --> 00:24:13.530
everyone seems to be listening
to the same tune...


173
00:26:01.095 --> 00:26:03.640
- What's up?
- Here's a present.


174
00:26:03.848 --> 00:26:05.767
- For me?
- Yeah.


175
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:09.520
Look.

176
00:26:10.605 --> 00:26:13.608
It's a tag they put
on the turtles.


177
00:26:13.983 --> 00:26:15.610
I've got one too.

178
00:26:16.903 --> 00:26:18.029
What's it for?

179
00:26:18.237 --> 00:26:20.239
To follow their migratory routes.

180
00:26:20.448 --> 00:26:23.368
These two
are from the same family.


181
00:26:23.576 --> 00:26:24.786
Where's this one from?

182
00:26:24.994 --> 00:26:26.412
Africa.

183
00:26:27.330 --> 00:26:28.790
Cool.

184
00:26:28.998 --> 00:26:31.918
It's cool. Thanks.

185
00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:34.504
You're not wearing it?

186
00:26:34.796 --> 00:26:37.382
Maybe later...

187
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.842
You don't like it?

188
00:26:41.928 --> 00:26:45.223
Well, I'm not sure. I'll see.

189
00:26:55.024 --> 00:26:56.609
Careful with that.

190
00:26:56.818 --> 00:26:59.070
- What is it?
- Corticoid.


191
00:26:59.487 --> 00:27:01.990
So I don't grow a beard.

192
00:27:16.796 --> 00:27:18.131
Good morning.

193
00:27:22.343 --> 00:27:24.012
Perhaps I can help you.

194
00:27:24.512 --> 00:27:25.847
With what?

195
00:27:26.305 --> 00:27:27.640
To speak with him.

196
00:27:28.433 --> 00:27:30.852
To explain what we'd do to her.

197
00:27:34.355 --> 00:27:35.606
Shall we go?

198
00:27:39.652 --> 00:27:41.154
We'll be right back.

199
00:28:33.498 --> 00:28:34.332
What is it?

200
00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:36.876
A rare species. 
Don't touch it.

201
00:28:48.346 --> 00:28:51.516
What do you know about
the species in my house?


202
00:29:04.112 --> 00:29:05.488
Stop the car.

203
00:29:12.787 --> 00:29:14.288
I'm sure this was the spot.

204
00:29:15.957 --> 00:29:18.376
There is where I got pregnant
with Alex.


205
00:29:21.129 --> 00:29:23.256
We still lived in Buenos Aires.

206
00:30:19.061 --> 00:30:21.647
I was afraid
somebody would see us...


207
00:30:22.648 --> 00:30:25.568
I was worried somebody
would drive by and see us.


208
00:30:35.745 --> 00:30:37.163
It's ridiculous.

209
00:30:37.496 --> 00:30:39.081
What is?

210
00:30:41.042 --> 00:30:43.961
Being worried about
what other people think.


211
00:30:47.131 --> 00:30:49.717
They'd ask:
"Is it a boy or a girl?"


212
00:30:49.926 --> 00:30:53.095
It's the first thing
they ask in the clinic.


213
00:30:56.474 --> 00:30:58.935
When did she stop
the corticoid?


214
00:31:02.271 --> 00:31:04.523
Two weeks ago.

215
00:31:06.734 --> 00:31:09.278
You know what will happen?

216
00:31:14.867 --> 00:31:16.035
What?

217
00:31:16.244 --> 00:31:17.787
She'll masculinize.

218
00:31:19.413 --> 00:31:21.958
Everything will change.
Her body, her cycles.


219
00:31:22.917 --> 00:31:25.253
She'll stop developing as a woman.

220
00:31:29.715 --> 00:31:30.549
That's enough.

221
00:31:46.649 --> 00:31:49.110
Have you thought
about what I said?


222
00:31:50.403 --> 00:31:52.113
I'm not having sex with you.

223
00:31:52.321 --> 00:31:53.656
Why not?

224
00:31:54.031 --> 00:31:55.324
Because you're too young.

225
00:31:55.533 --> 00:31:56.575
So what?

226
00:31:56.951 --> 00:31:59.287
And we've only just met.

227
00:32:00.079 --> 00:32:03.082
That's why! I'll never fall
for somebody like you.


228
00:32:03.291 --> 00:32:04.542
Nor I for you.

229
00:32:08.462 --> 00:32:12.925
You say you're older than me
but you repeat every word I say...


230
00:32:15.011 --> 00:32:16.846
You're not normal.

231
00:32:17.263 --> 00:32:19.432
You're different and you know it.

232
00:32:19.807 --> 00:32:22.560
Why do people stare at you?

233
00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.564
Why? What's wrong with you?

234
00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:35.299
Stay.

235
00:33:39.053 --> 00:33:40.304
Come here.

236
00:34:11.502 --> 00:34:14.463
- I don't have anything.
- I like it.


237
00:37:52.556 --> 00:37:55.976
Sex Change For Boy Authorized

238
00:38:01.231 --> 00:38:04.735
At 18, Scherer Starts the Journey
From Woman to Man


239
00:38:15.079 --> 00:38:17.122
We can start if you want.

240
00:38:19.166 --> 00:38:21.543
What about the children?

241
00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:27.883
He must be with Alex.

242
00:38:31.512 --> 00:38:33.055
Sweetheart?

243
00:39:19.893 --> 00:39:21.228
Here he is.

244
00:39:22.479 --> 00:39:24.481
- What happened to you?
- It's pouring.


245
00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.525
Poor darling.

246
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:32.364
Get changed and come eat.

247
00:40:09.568 --> 00:40:10.652
What's wrong?

248
00:40:10.861 --> 00:40:11.653
Nothin'.

249
00:40:11.862 --> 00:40:13.530
Give me your plate.

250
00:40:13.947 --> 00:40:14.990
"No'in"?

251
00:40:15.824 --> 00:40:17.075
What's "no'in"?

252
00:40:17.618 --> 00:40:18.952
Leave him alone.

253
00:40:19.453 --> 00:40:21.205
I want to know what's wrong.

254
00:40:22.164 --> 00:40:23.916
Sorry I'm late.

255
00:40:35.469 --> 00:40:37.262
She's not feeling well.

256
00:40:42.142 --> 00:40:43.352
Anything wrong?

257
00:40:44.186 --> 00:40:45.729
Nothing.

258
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.441
Can I see?

259
00:40:53.445 --> 00:40:55.072
See how well my son draws.

260
00:41:05.666 --> 00:41:09.253
- I don't drink.
- Yes, you will. You're old enough.


261
00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:15.008
It won't hurt him.

262
00:41:20.806 --> 00:41:21.723
Go on, drink up.

263
00:41:21.932 --> 00:41:23.934
Don't drink if you don't want to.

264
00:41:24.142 --> 00:41:25.269
I really don't mind...

265
00:41:25.477 --> 00:41:27.729
I can't stand bullying.

266
00:41:27.938 --> 00:41:30.524
- It's not a big deal.
- Yes, it's a big deal.


267
00:41:31.233 --> 00:41:34.570
We moved to be far away
from certain kinds of people.


268
00:41:37.865 --> 00:41:40.868
And now, we're all sitting
round the same table.


269
00:42:02.389 --> 00:42:03.557
Oh yes...

270
00:42:03.765 --> 00:42:05.017
Give it to me baby!

271
00:42:05.225 --> 00:42:07.060
Take this and this!

272
00:42:10.022 --> 00:42:11.273
Again! Again!

273
00:42:11.481 --> 00:42:12.524
Here, yes!

274
00:42:12.733 --> 00:42:14.234
You've done it already.

275
00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:17.529
How d'you know?

276
00:42:17.738 --> 00:42:19.072
I can tell.

277
00:42:23.744 --> 00:42:25.203
With my cousin.

278
00:42:25.412 --> 00:42:27.122
Five times.

279
00:42:27.331 --> 00:42:30.459
I didn't want to, at first.
I didn't like it.


280
00:42:31.335 --> 00:42:34.796
He said we weren't
going all the way, just half way.


281
00:42:35.005 --> 00:42:37.174
We ended up going all the way.

282
00:42:37.716 --> 00:42:39.593
It didn't hurt much.

283
00:42:47.184 --> 00:42:48.810
Put this on, Alex.

284
00:43:04.618 --> 00:43:05.953
I'll put the spare mattress here.

285
00:43:07.537 --> 00:43:08.872
On the floor.

286
00:43:09.039 --> 00:43:10.582
Or Alex goes home.

287
00:43:15.128 --> 00:43:16.838
Go to sleep, it's late.

288
00:43:20.425 --> 00:43:22.427
Give it to me baby...

289
00:43:30.936 --> 00:43:33.230
I have a special bottle of liquor.

290
00:43:34.523 --> 00:43:36.149
I'm going to bed.

291
00:43:39.569 --> 00:43:40.862
We're all going to sleep.

292
00:43:41.071 --> 00:43:42.948
Don't. I'll be right back.

293
00:43:54.543 --> 00:43:56.128
What's the matter?

294
00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:59.256
- I found them together.
- Who?


295
00:43:59.464 --> 00:44:02.092
Alex and Alvaro.

296
00:44:02.342 --> 00:44:03.385
What do you mean?

297
00:44:03.593 --> 00:44:05.303
Together.

298
00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.099
- Doing what?
- I don't know, I walked away.


299
00:44:10.142 --> 00:44:11.435
On top...

300
00:44:12.102 --> 00:44:14.563
- What?
- She was on top.


301
00:44:14.771 --> 00:44:15.689
I don't understand...

302
00:44:15.897 --> 00:44:19.526
She was banging the boy
through his ass. Clear enough?


303
00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:32.998
It was bound to happen.

304
00:44:33.206 --> 00:44:34.916
That's enough, Kraken.

305
00:44:41.757 --> 00:44:43.884
We knew this would happen.

306
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:48.972
She can't stay a woman.

307
00:44:53.977 --> 00:44:56.188
- What do you mean "normal"?
- What?


308
00:44:56.396 --> 00:44:58.857
- You said normal.
- I didn't say anything.


309
00:45:02.611 --> 00:45:04.738
Don't build your hopes up.

310
00:45:07.532 --> 00:45:09.910
She'll never be a woman,

311
00:45:11.203 --> 00:45:13.955
even if a surgeon cuts off
what she doesn't need.


312
00:45:16.041 --> 00:45:18.418
When did you tell them?

313
00:45:18.877 --> 00:45:20.378
That's why they're here?

314
00:45:20.587 --> 00:45:23.340
I just wanted them to meet her.

315
00:45:23.507 --> 00:45:25.133
I'm not crazy.

316
00:45:27.761 --> 00:45:29.930
You talk to him.

317
00:45:36.645 --> 00:45:38.855
What if she wants to?

318
00:48:18.473 --> 00:48:19.683
Fill it up?

319
00:48:31.861 --> 00:48:33.238
Sorry.

320
00:49:12.027 --> 00:49:13.403
What do you want?

321
00:49:13.987 --> 00:49:15.697
Are you a doctor?

322
00:49:16.614 --> 00:49:18.116
A journalist?

323
00:49:22.287 --> 00:49:23.997
I have a daughter,

324
00:49:24.205 --> 00:49:25.790
a son...

325
00:49:32.672 --> 00:49:33.882
I've seen you before.

326
00:49:35.008 --> 00:49:38.678
You've been here before, right?

327
00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.692
I don't usually drink, but...

328
00:49:52.901 --> 00:49:54.986
it'll do us both good.

329
00:50:03.745 --> 00:50:04.704
Your son?

330
00:50:09.084 --> 00:50:10.752
Adopted.

331
00:50:12.504 --> 00:50:15.423
We're doing the paperwork
to adopt a girl.


332
00:50:15.632 --> 00:50:17.175
The perfect family.

333
00:50:25.016 --> 00:50:26.559
How old is Alex?

334
00:50:26.768 --> 00:50:27.894
Fifteen.

335
00:50:31.648 --> 00:50:33.733
Want to see me at her age?

336
00:50:38.655 --> 00:50:40.532
If you don't mind.

337
00:51:09.018 --> 00:51:11.813
That's me at 12.

338
00:51:15.525 --> 00:51:18.945
Keep it. Give it to Alex.

339
00:51:25.493 --> 00:51:27.370
Did you always know?

340
00:51:27.954 --> 00:51:29.747
That I wasn't a woman?

341
00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:36.504
I still wonder how it all would've
been without the operation.


342
00:51:38.256 --> 00:51:40.592
How was your transformation...

343
00:51:40.925 --> 00:51:42.844
from woman to man?

344
00:51:45.096 --> 00:51:47.390
When I was 16,

345
00:51:47.599 --> 00:51:50.310
I started taking testosterone.

346
00:51:50.977 --> 00:51:52.145
At 17, I had surgery.

347
00:51:52.353 --> 00:51:55.773
That same year,
I changed my name.


348
00:51:56.483 --> 00:51:59.194
I met my wife six months later.

349
00:52:00.862 --> 00:52:03.740
The rest of my life
is sleeping in that bed...


350
00:52:10.955 --> 00:52:13.124
What if I got it all wrong?

351
00:52:13.541 --> 00:52:15.418
By letting her choose?

352
00:52:18.588 --> 00:52:21.299
Do you know what my
earliest memories are?


353
00:52:22.008 --> 00:52:24.469
Medical examinations.

354
00:52:25.136 --> 00:52:29.390
I thought I was so horrible
when I was born


355
00:52:29.766 --> 00:52:34.020
that I had to have five operations
before my first birthday.


356
00:52:35.813 --> 00:52:38.441
That's what
they call "normalization".


357
00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:42.153
It's not a surgery. 
It's castration.

358
00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:50.119
Making her afraid of her own body

359
00:52:50.328 --> 00:52:53.164
is the worst thing
you can do to your child.


360
00:53:35.707 --> 00:53:37.542
What are you doing?

361
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:52.320
You're looking
at me differently...


362
00:56:53.571 --> 00:56:55.531
You're older.

363
00:57:05.792 --> 00:57:09.796
Then, you could've told me
why these people came to visit.


364
00:57:10.004 --> 00:57:11.631
I didn't know.

365
00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:29.398
Are you coming with me?

366
00:57:29.607 --> 00:57:31.734
No, I want to walk for a while.

367
01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:05.054
I don't understand.

368
01:00:07.098 --> 01:00:10.101
- You're not...
- I'm both.


369
01:00:13.187 --> 01:00:14.981
But that's impossible.

370
01:00:15.189 --> 01:00:18.067
You tell me what is
and isn't impossible?


371
01:00:20.778 --> 01:00:23.406
But do you like guys or girls?

372
01:00:25.449 --> 01:00:26.993
I don't know.

373
01:00:40.923 --> 01:00:43.342
Sorry about what I did to you.

374
01:00:44.385 --> 01:00:46.595
You didn't do anything.

375
01:00:48.389 --> 01:00:50.141
I'm not upset...

376
01:00:52.393 --> 01:00:54.103
I liked it.

377
01:00:54.895 --> 01:00:56.355
Really?

378
01:01:01.027 --> 01:01:02.611
So did I.

379
01:01:03.654 --> 01:01:05.114
You did?

380
01:01:10.953 --> 01:01:13.789
Then let's finish it.
We didn't finish it...


381
01:01:13.998 --> 01:01:15.166
Never with you.

382
01:01:15.374 --> 01:01:17.793
- Why?
- I want something else.


383
01:01:19.003 --> 01:01:20.796
I want something else too!

384
01:01:21.422 --> 01:01:23.382
Oh, yeah? What do you want?

385
01:01:26.010 --> 01:01:27.636
What do you want?

386
01:01:32.058 --> 01:01:33.601
- It'll be our secret.
- Liar.


387
01:01:33.809 --> 01:01:35.603
- I won't tell anybody!
- Get off!


388
01:01:35.811 --> 01:01:39.023
Go! Tell everybody I'm a monster.

389
01:02:14.475 --> 01:02:15.351
Where's Alex?

390
01:02:15.559 --> 01:02:16.936
What are you doing here?

391
01:02:17.144 --> 01:02:19.396
- I told you not to come here.
- Where is she?


392
01:02:19.605 --> 01:02:20.981
Beat it, Vando.

393
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:23.692
Your father's in real trouble.

394
01:03:19.748 --> 01:03:20.791
Wait up!

395
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.376
Come on.

396
01:03:24.587 --> 01:03:26.338
Come over here.

397
01:03:29.049 --> 01:03:31.302
Don't worry.

398
01:03:32.344 --> 01:03:33.762
Calm down.

399
01:03:36.473 --> 01:03:38.225
We're not going to hurt you.

400
01:03:38.434 --> 01:03:40.477
Take it easy.

401
01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.117
Let go of me! Please!

402
01:04:11.008 --> 01:04:12.760
Hold her down. Hold her.

403
01:04:17.890 --> 01:04:18.933
Bitch!

404
01:04:20.893 --> 01:04:24.271
Take it easy, stay still.

405
01:04:24.563 --> 01:04:26.190
Hold her still.

406
01:04:32.988 --> 01:04:36.283
It's alright, I just want to see.

407
01:04:37.368 --> 01:04:39.495
Let me see what you've got
down there!


408
01:04:40.829 --> 01:04:42.164
What have you got down there?

409
01:04:44.708 --> 01:04:46.126
What have you got?

410
01:04:46.961 --> 01:04:48.420
What have you got?

411
01:04:56.095 --> 01:04:57.972
We're not hurting you.

412
01:05:02.184 --> 01:05:03.352
It's a prick.

413
01:05:03.769 --> 01:05:06.021
- No way.
- She's got both.


414
01:05:07.481 --> 01:05:10.025
- Does it get hard?
- I told you it wasn't bullshit.


415
01:05:12.778 --> 01:05:14.446
She's got everything.

416
01:05:14.947 --> 01:05:18.033
- It's gross.
- No way, it's great.


417
01:05:18.242 --> 01:05:19.159
Do you get hard?

418
01:05:19.368 --> 01:05:21.662
- Let me see...
- Do you get hard?


419
01:05:21.870 --> 01:05:23.372
Answer him!

420
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.336
I want to see if you get hard.

421
01:05:34.258 --> 01:05:36.010
Let go of her!

422
01:05:36.218 --> 01:05:38.304
Get out of here, asshole!

423
01:05:39.221 --> 01:05:41.849
- We didn't do anything...
- Beat it!


424
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.061
Beat it!

425
01:06:37.613 --> 01:06:39.656
- Does it hurt?
- No.


426
01:06:40.366 --> 01:06:42.993
Did they hurt you anywhere else?

427
01:06:43.911 --> 01:06:45.412
I'll take her to the hospital.

428
01:06:45.621 --> 01:06:46.789
I don't want anyone to touch her.

429
01:06:46.997 --> 01:06:50.250
- It'll be alright.
- It won't be alright.


430
01:08:07.077 --> 01:08:08.203
Come here.

431
01:08:10.581 --> 01:08:12.249
Let go of me.

432
01:08:12.458 --> 01:08:14.293
Stay away from my daughter!

433
01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:15.752
Enough!

434
01:08:16.295 --> 01:08:17.212
You'll kill him!

435
01:08:17.754 --> 01:08:19.756
Enough? You say it's enough?

436
01:08:20.257 --> 01:08:22.593
You're just like them. Worse.

437
01:08:22.801 --> 01:08:25.179
Stay away from my son...

438
01:09:05.302 --> 01:09:08.430
Just agree to the surgery.
It's not too late.


439
01:09:08.722 --> 01:09:11.683
You can't hide her
for the rest of her life.


440
01:09:12.518 --> 01:09:14.019
Hide her?

441
01:09:18.357 --> 01:09:20.526
You think she's a freak.

442
01:09:31.495 --> 01:09:35.499
We came here to stop
hearing every idiot's opinion.


443
01:10:00.357 --> 01:10:01.858
I've had enough.

444
01:10:03.569 --> 01:10:06.238
Enough pills, enough operations,

445
01:10:06.446 --> 01:10:08.657
enough changing schools.

446
01:10:08.865 --> 01:10:11.535
I want things to stay the same.

447
01:11:41.625 --> 01:11:44.127
She was diagnosed

448
01:11:44.961 --> 01:11:47.714
They wanted to film the birth

449
01:11:49.007 --> 01:11:51.134
for "medical interest"

450
01:11:51.343 --> 01:11:53.887
and to present the case
to the ethics council.


451
01:11:54.346 --> 01:11:56.431
We said no, to all of it.

452
01:11:57.766 --> 01:11:59.309
Alex was born blue.

453
01:11:59.518 --> 01:12:02.521
She took 40 seconds
to start breathing.


454
01:12:05.148 --> 01:12:07.150
Then, they wanted to operate.

455
01:12:07.359 --> 01:12:09.820
They said the only after effect

456
01:12:10.028 --> 01:12:12.072
would be the scar.

457
01:12:16.201 --> 01:12:17.828
Suli was scared.

458
01:12:19.913 --> 01:12:22.791
I convinced her
not to do anything.


459
01:12:23.333 --> 01:12:25.460
She was perfect.

460
01:12:27.003 --> 01:12:29.339
From the moment I set eyes on her.

461
01:12:30.674 --> 01:12:32.092
Perfect.

462
01:14:34.339 --> 01:14:36.216
Forget her.

463
01:14:37.092 --> 01:14:39.261
She's too much for you.

464
01:15:26.266 --> 01:15:28.059
I can't leave yet.

465
01:15:35.108 --> 01:15:36.902
I want to speak to him.

466
01:15:39.905 --> 01:15:41.406
We have to leave.

467
01:15:43.199 --> 01:15:45.160
Go fetch your son.

468
01:16:18.735 --> 01:16:20.445
You'll catch a cold.

469
01:16:28.703 --> 01:16:29.913
May I?

470
01:16:42.884 --> 01:16:44.552
I thought you didn't drink.

471
01:16:45.011 --> 01:16:47.263
You told me I have to drink...

472
01:17:00.527 --> 01:17:02.404
Do you like me?

473
01:17:03.697 --> 01:17:05.448
You're my son.

474
01:17:06.408 --> 01:17:09.160
Let's cut the crap
and talk seriously.


475
01:17:13.123 --> 01:17:14.874
Kind of.

476
01:17:22.882 --> 01:17:24.968
What about me? 
Do you like me?

477
01:17:27.178 --> 01:17:29.055
Do you like what I do?

478
01:17:29.264 --> 01:17:32.183
I'd give anything
to have your talent.


479
01:17:42.527 --> 01:17:45.363
And...me... am I talented?

480
01:17:52.871 --> 01:17:56.666
Do you think one day...

481
01:17:58.251 --> 01:18:01.171
- Do you think that...
- No, I don't.


482
01:18:06.342 --> 01:18:08.970
I just don't get it.

483
01:18:09.512 --> 01:18:11.890
It wasn't always this way.

484
01:18:12.265 --> 01:18:13.850
What way?

485
01:18:14.642 --> 01:18:17.979
When did you sto taking
an interest in me?


486
01:18:21.232 --> 01:18:23.568
It was a bad idea to come.

487
01:18:24.444 --> 01:18:26.154
Your mother is right.
We're leaving.


488
01:18:26.362 --> 01:18:29.199
- When?
- Now. At dawn.


489
01:18:29.407 --> 01:18:31.951
No. I can't leave yet.

490
01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:33.995
Why not?

491
01:18:36.873 --> 01:18:38.541
Do you like Alex?

492
01:18:41.127 --> 01:18:43.004
Finally good news.

493
01:18:45.131 --> 01:18:47.550
I was afraid you were a fag.

494
01:19:22.585 --> 01:19:24.087
What are you doing?

495
01:19:27.132 --> 01:19:29.175
Looking after you.

496
01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.723
You can't look after me for ever.

497
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:42.272
Until you can choose.

498
01:19:43.148 --> 01:19:44.482
What?

499
01:19:44.858 --> 01:19:46.609
Whatever you want.

500
01:20:06.254 --> 01:20:09.340
What if there isn't
a decision to make?


501
01:20:28.234 --> 01:20:30.028
I've finished it.

502
01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:46.377
Did they hurt you?

503
01:21:04.771 --> 01:21:07.065
Did you go to the police?

504
01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.447
That's your decision.

505
01:21:15.782 --> 01:21:17.784
We'll press charges if you want,

506
01:21:20.787 --> 01:21:22.747
but it's your decision.

507
01:21:35.551 --> 01:21:38.054
Everybody'll find out.

508
01:21:45.186 --> 01:21:47.105
Let them.

509
01:23:47.892 --> 01:23:49.894
Have a good trip.

510
01:23:54.941 --> 01:23:56.651
I'll be right back.

511
01:24:36.732 --> 01:24:38.860
Will I see you again?

512
01:24:40.403 --> 01:24:42.447
I don't think so.

513
01:24:47.493 --> 01:24:48.786
Look.

514
01:25:04.177 --> 01:25:07.763
I never imagined I'd fall
for someone like you.


515
01:25:09.140 --> 01:25:10.892
But it happened.

516
01:25:14.729 --> 01:25:16.063
Me too.

517
01:25:23.321 --> 01:25:25.656
You're after something else.

518
01:25:39.629 --> 01:25:41.088
What do you regret the most?

519
01:25:41.297 --> 01:25:44.425
Not seeing me again,
or not having seen it?


520
01:25:58.856 --> 01:26:00.566
Do you want to see?

521
01:26:27.718 --> 01:26:29.845
Hurry up, we'll miss the ship.
