All right, Mr. Barstow.

10
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.895
I have the reservation here for you
and Mr. Dickens in room 357...


11
00:00:39.978 --> 00:00:41.104
Ooh, Dickens!

12
00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:42.689
Thank you.

13
00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:43.899
Dickens!

14
00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:48.653
Merry Christmas.

15
00:00:48.737 --> 00:00:50.965
You've reached the Hotel Fontaine,
your home for the holidays.


16
00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.425
This is Georgia speaking.
How may I help you?


17
00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.493
You can help me by coming outside

18
00:00:54.576 --> 00:00:56.620
and giving me a hand
with all of this stuff.


19
00:00:56.703 --> 00:00:57.746
Kiki, great. You're here.

20
00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:58.997
I will be right out.

21
00:01:04.586 --> 00:01:05.754
Ooh, Georgia!

22
00:01:05.837 --> 00:01:07.315
Florence! Did the champagne arrive yet?

23
00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:09.883
Oh, yes. All 20 cases.

24
00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.801
- Great.
- You really got the good stuff, huh?


25
00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:13.428
Christmas only comes once a year.

26
00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:14.655
- Yep.
- There you go. Thank you.


27
00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.432
Oh, uh, that goes outside
by the front door to the right, please.


28
00:01:17.516 --> 00:01:18.850
Thank you so much.

29
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.227
Oops.

30
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.895
Oh, my God. Thank you, Milton.

31
00:01:21.978 --> 00:01:23.998
Who knew the Christmas rush
would be so hazardous this year?


32
00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:27.484
Oh! Oh, uh, the bedside table lamp
in 209 needs a fresh bulb,


33
00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.445
414 needs fresh batteries in the remote,
and 327 has a leaky tub.


34
00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:31.987
Leaky tub. Yeah, 
I'm all over it.

35
00:01:32.072 --> 00:01:34.282
You're the best. Thank you, Milton.

36
00:01:38.495 --> 00:01:39.955
Uh-hmm. Thank you.

37
00:01:42.415 --> 00:01:45.043
Ho, ho, ho, how about a donation?

38
00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:47.337
Ho, ho, yourself. 
How about some help?

39
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.649
Well, if you give me a donation,
I'll give you some help.


40
00:01:49.673 --> 00:01:51.192
Where is your Christmas spirit, Santa?

41
00:01:51.216 --> 00:01:53.385
Left it up north with the other reindeer.

42
00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:55.095
I'm so sorry it took so long.

43
00:01:55.178 --> 00:01:58.223
I had no idea how hard it would be
to find a partridge in a pear tree.


44
00:01:58.306 --> 00:01:59.641
So, I had to go with the macaw.

45
00:01:59.724 --> 00:02:02.411
As my head concierge, you shouldn't have
to be schlepping all of this,


46
00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:05.355
but with my extra holiday time staff
comes in tomorrow, hopefully.


47
00:02:05.438 --> 00:02:06.815
Don't worry about it.

48
00:02:06.898 --> 00:02:10.110
What are best friends for,
if not to schlep a little yuletide cheer?


49
00:02:10.193 --> 00:02:11.793
Besides, I should really be thanking you

50
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.823
for letting me organize this whole
Jingle Mingle party myself this year.


51
00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:16.491
Jingle Mingle, what is that?

52
00:02:16.575 --> 00:02:18.553
It's our annual Christmas Eve party
for singles who wanna mingle.


53
00:02:18.577 --> 00:02:20.471
And also, for singles
who are not ready to mingle.


54
00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:22.414
Basically, it's a Christmas party
for anyone


55
00:02:22.497 --> 00:02:24.225
who doesn't have something to do
on Christmas Eve.


56
00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:25.542
Where's my invitation?

57
00:02:25.625 --> 00:02:26.960
Every party needs a Santa Claus.

58
00:02:27.043 --> 00:02:28.163
Not one on the naughty list.

59
00:02:28.211 --> 00:02:29.897
Hey, I see you when you're sleeping,
you know?


60
00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:31.423
Creepy!

61
00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:33.466
I'm Santa... I'm Santa Claus!

62
00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:35.176
It was a Santa joke!

63
00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.220
Just a whiff of white truffle, chef?

64
00:02:37.304 --> 00:02:38.305
Just a whiff.

65
00:02:45.228 --> 00:02:46.354
Et voila!

66
00:02:46.438 --> 00:02:49.278
You know you go through a lot
of trouble making Georgia lunch every day?


67
00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:52.152
It's not trouble.
Besides, it's not the point.


68
00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:53.695
That is the point.

69
00:02:53.778 --> 00:02:55.905
You've been working here
for over a year now.


70
00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.366
And she still doesn't know
how you really feel, does she?


71
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.494
Victor, Georgia and I are just friends.

72
00:03:01.578 --> 00:03:02.621
Good friends.

73
00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:04.998
All right, chef.

74
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:07.208
Just because you and Anna
are sneaking around


75
00:03:07.292 --> 00:03:08.710
doesn't mean that we all are.

76
00:03:08.793 --> 00:03:12.213
Uh, we ain't sneaking around.
I mean, you won't tell anybody, right?


77
00:03:12.297 --> 00:03:15.467
Look, Anna just wants to keep it
on the down low, all right?


78
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.385
Your secret's safe with me.

79
00:03:21.348 --> 00:03:23.350
Oh, hey, Anna. 
How you doing?

80
00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:24.559
Luke, hi!

81
00:03:24.643 --> 00:03:26.394
Little last-minute Christmas shopping?

82
00:03:26.895 --> 00:03:28.313
Oh. Yeah, sort of.

83
00:03:28.396 --> 00:03:30.857
If it's for Victor, you better hide it.
He's right in there.


84
00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:34.444
How did you...
Victor doesn't want anyone to know.


85
00:03:34.527 --> 00:03:35.737
Know what?

86
00:03:48.833 --> 00:03:50.960
Oh, my God.

87
00:03:51.044 --> 00:03:52.087
Okay.

88
00:03:54.673 --> 00:03:55.757
Wow.

89
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.467
Let me guess. Kiki made the sign.

90
00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.426
Her marketing instincts are great.

91
00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:01.391
She's just a little
heavy-handed on the glitter.


92
00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:04.015
At least it is covering
the giant crack in the wall.


93
00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:05.934
They say cracks let the magic in.

94
00:04:06.017 --> 00:04:08.269
I'm afraid I don't believe in magic.

95
00:04:08.353 --> 00:04:10.313
- Well, do you believe in lunch?
- Oh, my God.


96
00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:12.166
You don't have to keep doing this for me.
You know that.


97
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.317
Hey, making lunch for you
is the highlight of my day.


98
00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:18.279
Well, you making lunch for me
is the highlight of my day.


99
00:04:18.363 --> 00:04:22.075
So take some time and eat.

100
00:04:23.368 --> 00:04:25.286
Oh, God.

101
00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:27.789
There's just so much I have to get done
before Christmas Eve.


102
00:04:27.872 --> 00:04:29.558
The lights. The lights
on the fifth floor aren't working.


103
00:04:29.582 --> 00:04:31.334
I forgot to tell Milton. Oh, my God!

104
00:04:31.417 --> 00:04:34.170
So they can use candles. 
It adds mystery.

105
00:04:35.505 --> 00:04:38.675
This rug is ancient.

106
00:04:38.758 --> 00:04:39.798
I have to change this rug!

107
00:04:39.843 --> 00:04:41.845
Not ancient. Vintage.

108
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:46.534
Does that tree look crooked to you?

109
00:04:46.558 --> 00:04:48.852
A little. I think it's the weight
of all the ornaments.


110
00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:50.913
I wanted to get matching ones this year,
I just ran out of time.


111
00:04:50.937 --> 00:04:53.773
No, I thought that was
the whole point of our tree.


112
00:04:53.857 --> 00:04:55.400
People bring their own ornaments.

113
00:04:55.483 --> 00:04:57.193
Makes it feel like home.

114
00:04:58.236 --> 00:05:00.488
Hey, not bad.

115
00:05:01.156 --> 00:05:03.116
Not bad for a seven-year-old.

116
00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.702
I remember it took me
a whole week to make that.


117
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:08.788
I guess I always knew
I was gonna grow up to work with food.


118
00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:14.002
What's the matter? Is it cold?

119
00:05:14.085 --> 00:05:16.755
No, no. It's perfect.

120
00:05:16.838 --> 00:05:18.840
It's just...

121
00:05:18.923 --> 00:05:21.009
I'm so lucky to have you.

122
00:05:21.593 --> 00:05:23.136
You're such a good chef.

123
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.806
You know you could do a lot better
than this old hotel of ours.


124
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.225
I love this old hotel of ours.

125
00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:31.018
And the way I look at it,

126
00:05:31.102 --> 00:05:32.937
it's not always the place
that's important.


127
00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:35.398
Sometimes it's the people.

128
00:05:39.444 --> 00:05:40.737
Oh, my God! Now what?

129
00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:41.820
Thank you.

130
00:05:43.406 --> 00:05:45.116
Ugh, glitter.

131
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.927
Hey, enough photos.
Enough photos. Stop with the flash.


132
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:49.245
No. No, you do not have a release.

133
00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:51.289
Thank you. Move, move, move.

134
00:05:51.372 --> 00:05:53.917
Not the cameras. Not the cameras, please.
No flash. No flash.


135
00:05:58.505 --> 00:06:00.524
Welcome to the Hotel Fontaine,
your home for the holidays.


136
00:06:00.548 --> 00:06:01.883
We have a reservation.

137
00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:03.718
Of course. And the name is...

138
00:06:03.802 --> 00:06:04.802
Seriously?

139
00:06:05.762 --> 00:06:06.888
This is Pandora.

140
00:06:06.971 --> 00:06:08.411
You probably heard her last release.

141
00:06:08.473 --> 00:06:10.183
Love, Love, Love is All Couture to Me.

142
00:06:11.851 --> 00:06:14.145
Never mind, Jimothy. Nobody did.

143
00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:15.313
That's why we're here.

144
00:06:15.396 --> 00:06:18.233
Guru Peterson.
That's my life coach, Guru Peterson.


145
00:06:18.316 --> 00:06:22.946
He says I need a simple zen space
to ground myself for the holidays.


146
00:06:23.446 --> 00:06:25.114
Okay.

147
00:06:25.198 --> 00:06:27.325
Of course. Here you are.
We have you in a queen room.


148
00:06:27.408 --> 00:06:30.744
Avenue view, it's very simple,
very cozy, very zen.


149
00:06:30.829 --> 00:06:34.582
Cozy sounds... small.

150
00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:37.752
How about a king?

151
00:06:38.962 --> 00:06:40.004
Hmm.

152
00:06:40.088 --> 00:06:41.589
Okay.

153
00:06:41.673 --> 00:06:43.174
Uh, junior suite?

154
00:06:43.258 --> 00:06:44.634
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

155
00:06:45.343 --> 00:06:48.137
Okay. How about the presidential suite?

156
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:50.014
We'll make it work.

157
00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:54.519
Great. We will have your bag... s
brought right up.


158
00:06:54.602 --> 00:06:55.602
Uh-hmm.

159
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.105

167
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.712
Ah, there. That should do it.

168
00:07:20.795 --> 00:07:22.213
Well, thank you so much, Milton.

169
00:07:22.297 --> 00:07:23.590
Oh, you're welcome.

170
00:07:23.673 --> 00:07:24.942
Funny thing about this sink,
you know what,


171
00:07:24.966 --> 00:07:27.760
that's the third time that faucet
has come loose in the past week.


172
00:07:27.844 --> 00:07:30.179
You'd almost swear
somebody is doing it on purpose.


173
00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:33.558
Well, that's crazy. Why would anybody
wanna sabotage my sink?


174
00:07:33.641 --> 00:07:35.768
- Yeah. Weird.
- Weird.


175
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.486
I thought I told you to stop that.

176
00:07:46.195 --> 00:07:47.405
Checking in.

177
00:07:47.488 --> 00:07:49.991
Of course. And your name is...

178
00:07:51.492 --> 00:07:53.578
Prince Raymond. Hello.

179
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:56.748
Welcome to the Hotel Fontaine.
It is an honor to have you here.


180
00:07:56.831 --> 00:07:59.626
Thank you.
It's just Raymond though, no Prince.


181
00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:01.044
Right. I knew that.

182
00:08:01.127 --> 00:08:02.921
I just read about you
giving up your title.


183
00:08:03.004 --> 00:08:05.757
Yes. And I'm trying to keep
a low profile, you understand?


184
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.676
The Hotel Fontaine is famous
for its discretion with guests.


185
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.971
Instead of two turtle doves,
what if I went with a couple of rabbits?


186
00:08:12.055 --> 00:08:13.806
- Prince Raymond.
- Kiki.


187
00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:17.185
What? This is Prince Raymond of Caspernia.

188
00:08:17.268 --> 00:08:19.228
Not anymore. He quit.

189
00:08:19.312 --> 00:08:23.023
Oh. Well, so then you're not
in town looking for a princess?


190
00:08:23.107 --> 00:08:24.251
Please, forgive my associate.

191
00:08:24.275 --> 00:08:26.736
She has inhaled
too much Christmas glitter.


192
00:08:28.112 --> 00:08:29.197
Stop.

193
00:08:30.198 --> 00:08:31.366
I'm sorry about him.

194
00:08:31.449 --> 00:08:34.202
He's taken my abdication rather badly.

195
00:08:34.285 --> 00:08:35.870
He refuses to quit.

196
00:08:35.954 --> 00:08:38.474
I don't even think the earpiece
is attached to anything anymore.


197
00:08:39.749 --> 00:08:44.170
So your, um, not Royal Highness?

198
00:08:44.253 --> 00:08:46.047
Just Raymond is fine.

199
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.359
Just Raymond. Is this your first time
visiting in New York?


200
00:08:48.383 --> 00:08:49.801
Yes, actually.

201
00:08:49.884 --> 00:08:52.738
I want to get as far away from my family
this year for the holidays as possible.


202
00:08:52.762 --> 00:08:55.306
Well, my name is Georgia.
I am the hotel manager.


203
00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.558
And if there's anything at all
that I can do for you,


204
00:08:57.642 --> 00:08:58.893
please, don't hesitate to ask.

205
00:08:58.977 --> 00:09:01.145
Yes, we are all yours.

206
00:09:02.647 --> 00:09:04.607
Thank you for your help.

207
00:09:04.691 --> 00:09:05.691
No.

208
00:09:09.696 --> 00:09:11.656
Kiki, what was that?

209
00:09:11.739 --> 00:09:13.449
You are not going to believe this.

210
00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:15.326
But I dreamt about him last night.

211
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.036
This has to be some kind of sign.

212
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.287
- I mean, look.
- Yes.


213
00:09:18.371 --> 00:09:20.391
It's a sign that you should stop
reading that stuff.


214
00:09:20.415 --> 00:09:23.375
There is some kind of
Christmas magic happening here.


215
00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:25.169
The prince and I
are obviously meant to be.


216
00:09:25.253 --> 00:09:28.089
Kiki, I hate to break this to you
but there's no such thing as magic.


217
00:09:28.172 --> 00:09:31.212
So how do you explain the prince walking
through the front door of our hotel?


218
00:09:34.178 --> 00:09:36.723
Kiki, will you keep an eye
on the front desk for me, please?


219
00:09:36.806 --> 00:09:39.183
Yes. Wow! Thank you!

220
00:09:39.267 --> 00:09:41.811
Kiki, just watch the front desk.

221
00:09:41.894 --> 00:09:43.104
All right? Don't move.

222
00:09:43.187 --> 00:09:45.732
Okay. But don't be
surprised if you come back


223
00:09:45.815 --> 00:09:48.693
and I am suddenly Princess Kiki.

224
00:09:48.776 --> 00:09:49.986
Okay.

225
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:09.130
I should have this fixed
for you in no time, Georgia.


226
00:10:09.213 --> 00:10:11.049
Get that water working on 310, too.

227
00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:13.468
Great. Thank you, Milton.

228
00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:16.179
Um, is it possible for you
to maybe come back a little later?


229
00:10:16.721 --> 00:10:18.681
Sure. Yeah, I mean, you're the boss.

230
00:10:20.558 --> 00:10:22.310
Yeah. Everything okay?

231
00:10:22.393 --> 00:10:23.478
Yes. Yes.

232
00:10:23.561 --> 00:10:24.479
- Totally. Everything's fine.
- Yeah.


233
00:10:24.562 --> 00:10:26.322
Yeah, I have to make a phone call.
That's it.


234
00:10:26.397 --> 00:10:27.940
- All right.
- Yeah. Thank you.


235
00:10:28.024 --> 00:10:29.918
Well, yeah, if you need me,
you know where to find me, yeah?


236
00:10:29.942 --> 00:10:31.235
Sure do!

237
00:10:31.319 --> 00:10:32.779
- You okay?
- I'm okay.


238
00:10:32.862 --> 00:10:33.862
Yeah, thank you.

239
00:10:33.905 --> 00:10:35.531
All right. Great. Thanks.

240
00:10:41.245 --> 00:10:42.538
I must say, Georgia.

241
00:10:42.622 --> 00:10:44.999
You present a very persuasive argument

242
00:10:45.083 --> 00:10:49.003
and, uh, the design you sent
for the proposal, they look magnific.


243
00:10:49.087 --> 00:10:51.547
So innovative, so modern.

244
00:10:51.631 --> 00:10:53.216
Thank you, Madame Fontaine.

245
00:10:53.299 --> 00:10:54.717
The problem is...

246
00:10:55.718 --> 00:10:57.428
I hate modern.

247
00:10:58.638 --> 00:11:02.433
That's why we keep Hotel Fontaine
to preserve the past,


248
00:11:02.517 --> 00:11:04.310
the elegance, the way of life.

249
00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:07.230
Right. But you wouldn't have
to give any of that up.


250
00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:10.358
The Auberge Moderne
would be the Hotel Fontaine's


251
00:11:10.441 --> 00:11:13.486
cool modern counterpart
right here in New York City.


252
00:11:13.569 --> 00:11:15.154
I understand all of that, Georgia.

253
00:11:15.238 --> 00:11:16.614
But, uh...

254
00:11:16.697 --> 00:11:18.783
Oh, merci, Jean Luc.

255
00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:21.869
This sounds like
a great big deal of extra work


256
00:11:21.953 --> 00:11:24.622
and I hardly have time
to spend on my yacht as it is.


257
00:11:24.705 --> 00:11:26.332
That's the beauty of my proposal.

258
00:11:26.415 --> 00:11:28.125
You wouldn't have to do anything.

259
00:11:28.209 --> 00:11:31.295
I would take on full responsibility
as the executive director


260
00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:34.298
while you continue to travel
as much as you like.


261
00:11:34.382 --> 00:11:36.008
And all I'm asking for in return is...

262
00:11:36.092 --> 00:11:37.885
Forty-nine percent of the ownership.

263
00:11:37.969 --> 00:11:39.512
I think that's fair.

264
00:11:41.264 --> 00:11:45.143
Oh, your ambition reminds me so much
of myself when I was your age.


265
00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:48.604
And I must say,
you've done a wonderful job


266
00:11:48.688 --> 00:11:51.440
over the past two years
for me with the hotel.


267
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.696
And I often say
you are the daughter I never had.


268
00:11:56.779 --> 00:11:59.157
Really? Does this mean you'll do it?

269
00:11:59.866 --> 00:12:00.950
No.

270
00:12:02.451 --> 00:12:04.829
Oh. Uh, okay.

271
00:12:04.912 --> 00:12:07.623
Well, thank you anyway.

272
00:12:08.124 --> 00:12:10.751
And Madame,
would you please not mention this


273
00:12:10.835 --> 00:12:12.670
to any of the
staff here at the hotel?

274
00:12:12.753 --> 00:12:15.089
I wouldn't want them to know
I was thinking about leaving


275
00:12:15.173 --> 00:12:17.675
and it might rub them the wrong way.

276
00:12:17.758 --> 00:12:20.469
Wait, what if...

277
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:23.723
I invest half?

278
00:12:24.557 --> 00:12:25.433
Half?

279
00:12:25.516 --> 00:12:28.853
You come up with the rest
and we'll see if we do.


280
00:12:28.936 --> 00:12:31.772
Madam Fontaine, you know I don't have
access to that kind of money.


281
00:12:31.856 --> 00:12:35.109
Oh, but I know you
to be a very clever young girl.


282
00:12:35.193 --> 00:12:38.529
And I suspect that when you put
your mind to something,


283
00:12:38.613 --> 00:12:40.531
there is nothing you can't do.

284
00:12:45.953 --> 00:12:47.955
Merry Christmas, Georgia.

285
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.147
You're too early, you know...

286
00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:15.858
for Santa.

287
00:13:15.942 --> 00:13:18.069
He's not due for another four days.

288
00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:21.072
How do you always
know where to find me?

289
00:13:21.155 --> 00:13:22.365
Lucky guess.

290
00:13:22.949 --> 00:13:25.029
Plus, Kiki told me
you were going somewhere to think.


291
00:13:25.076 --> 00:13:27.286
And this is where
you always go to think.

292
00:13:30.957 --> 00:13:32.500
Christmas toast?

293
00:13:41.467 --> 00:13:42.927
You know me really well.

294
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.348
I know when something's bothering you.
What's up?


295
00:13:47.431 --> 00:13:48.432
Nothing.

296
00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:51.686
Nothing. Just a plan that didn't work out.

297
00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:52.895
What kind of plan?

298
00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:57.358
Actually, Luke, do you mind
if we don't talk about it?


299
00:13:57.441 --> 00:14:00.486
Yeah. Yeah. We don't have to
talk about it if you don't want to.


300
00:14:01.445 --> 00:14:02.780
Thank you.

301
00:14:07.994 --> 00:14:10.430
I just don't wanna end up like my parents.
You know what I mean?


302
00:14:10.454 --> 00:14:12.415
Like, they worked so hard
their whole lives.


303
00:14:12.498 --> 00:14:13.642
They came to this country with nothing,

304
00:14:13.666 --> 00:14:15.269
and they didn't even get
to own their own home.


305
00:14:15.293 --> 00:14:16.794
I just...

306
00:14:16.877 --> 00:14:19.422
I want to have
something to call my own.

307
00:14:19.922 --> 00:14:21.549
We're not talking about it, though.

308
00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:24.760
Sorry.

309
00:14:24.844 --> 00:14:26.095
No problem.

310
00:14:28.973 --> 00:14:30.641
Is there anything I can do to help?

311
00:14:31.684 --> 00:14:34.812
Not unless you got a big pile of cash
somewhere you wanna loan me.


312
00:14:34.895 --> 00:14:37.148
You know I would if I did.

313
00:14:40.318 --> 00:14:42.820
How do rich people get so rich anyway?

314
00:14:43.279 --> 00:14:44.613
Oh, that's easy.

315
00:14:44.697 --> 00:14:47.116
- They never spend their own money.
- What do you mean?


316
00:14:47.199 --> 00:14:50.703
Well, if they wanna buy something,
they find someone else to pay for it.


317
00:15:06.927 --> 00:15:08.012
Dickens?

318
00:15:09.347 --> 00:15:10.473
Dickens.

319
00:15:13.184 --> 00:15:14.393
Dickens!

320
00:15:15.353 --> 00:15:17.813
♪ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly ♪

321
00:15:17.897 --> 00:15:20.024
- Dickens?!
- ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪


322
00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:21.609
Oh, excuse me.

323
00:15:21.692 --> 00:15:23.069
Have you seen my dog?

324
00:15:23.152 --> 00:15:26.030
It's a little black Chihuahua,
about this big.


325
00:15:26.113 --> 00:15:27.573
His name is Dickens.

326
00:15:27.656 --> 00:15:31.035
He got out of his harness and ran off.
Have you seen him at all?


327
00:15:31.118 --> 00:15:32.953
That depends.

328
00:15:33.037 --> 00:15:34.914
Care to make a donation
to the candy cane fund?


329
00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:40.753
Okay.

330
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.256
Fine. Here.

331
00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:49.261
Little dog, black and tan
with happy waggin' tail?


332
00:15:49.345 --> 00:15:50.513
Yeah, that's it!

333
00:15:50.596 --> 00:15:51.889
Nah, I haven't seen him.

334
00:15:54.433 --> 00:15:57.228
Dickens! Dickens!

335
00:15:57.895 --> 00:16:00.064
Well, if it isn't my favorite little elf.

336
00:16:00.147 --> 00:16:01.690
Are we feeling more charitable today?

337
00:16:01.774 --> 00:16:04.610
Why don't you go back to
the North Pole and stop bothering people?


338
00:16:04.693 --> 00:16:06.404
Ooh. You know, if you're not careful,

339
00:16:06.487 --> 00:16:09.782
you'll end up with a lump
of coal in your stocking.


340
00:16:11.492 --> 00:16:12.886
Look, I realize
that I don't have the funds.


341
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.537
I just...

342
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.789
No, no, I don't own
any of my own property.


343
00:16:16.872 --> 00:16:18.249
I just...

344
00:16:18.332 --> 00:16:20.601
Is there anybody else
in the loan department I could talk to?


345
00:16:20.625 --> 00:16:24.922
Maybe like a supervisor or...
You are the supervisor.


346
00:16:25.923 --> 00:16:27.466
Merry Christmas to you, too.

347
00:16:30.261 --> 00:16:32.471
I had to hit five
different pet shops today,


348
00:16:32.555 --> 00:16:35.516
and most of them
had never even heard of French hens.


349
00:16:35.599 --> 00:16:37.017
Still sticking with the whole

350
00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:38.394
12 Days of Christmas theme, huh?

351
00:16:38.477 --> 00:16:40.896
Yeah. You know what happens
when I set my mind to something.


352
00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.565
Speaking of...

353
00:16:42.648 --> 00:16:45.276
I dreamt of Prince Raymond
again last night.


354
00:16:45.358 --> 00:16:47.337
Kiki, you know you're not supposed
to bother the guests.


355
00:16:47.361 --> 00:16:48.446
I'm not gonna bother him.

356
00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:52.199
I'm just gonna let him know
that we are destined to be together.


357
00:16:52.283 --> 00:16:54.511
I hope he doesn't think
I'm just after him for his money.


358
00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:56.162
I mean, he is a prince, right?

359
00:16:56.245 --> 00:16:57.997
He's probably got billions.

360
00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:09.383
Cream and sugar? Right.

361
00:17:10.384 --> 00:17:11.218
There you go.

362
00:17:11.302 --> 00:17:15.389
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells,
jingle all the way ♪♪


363
00:17:25.774 --> 00:17:27.234

00:18:26.627 --> 00:18:27.711
Great! Over here!

369
00:18:27.795 --> 00:18:29.213
Your highness, right here!

370
00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:31.048
Why are you here?

371
00:18:36.512 --> 00:18:40.975
I am so, so sorry, Mr., uh, Raymond.

372
00:18:41.058 --> 00:18:43.811
I will personally make sure
that that never happens again.


373
00:18:43.894 --> 00:18:46.021
You know, I'd rather hope
that being an ex-royal


374
00:18:46.105 --> 00:18:47.791
would mean I'd have
some privacy now and then.


375
00:18:47.815 --> 00:18:49.495
Now it seems I
can't even leave the hotel.

376
00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:52.026
Come with me.

377
00:18:54.154 --> 00:18:56.740
I cannot believe
I didn't think about this sooner.


378
00:18:56.824 --> 00:18:58.450
Not many people know about these stairs.

379
00:18:58.534 --> 00:19:03.372
The hotel uses them for deliveries,
but it's not that pretty.


380
00:19:03.872 --> 00:19:05.207
Oh, it's absolutely fine.

381
00:19:05.291 --> 00:19:06.667
Do you have any idea
how bored I am


382
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.910
withe people bowing and bloody trumpets
going off every time I walk into a room?


383
00:19:09.962 --> 00:19:11.964
This is a very nice change of pace.

384
00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:20.014
It isn't quite the New York
that tourists see, but it's private.


385
00:19:20.097 --> 00:19:22.933
And here, you can use this
during your stay with us.


386
00:19:23.434 --> 00:19:25.314
I very much appreciate this,
Georgia. Thank you.


387
00:19:25.686 --> 00:19:28.373
Of course. If there's anything else that
I can do for you, please just let me know.


388
00:19:28.397 --> 00:19:31.358
Actually, I do need some help
navigating your city.


389
00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:35.070
I don't suppose you know anyone
who's up for the task.

Love, Love, Love is All Couture to Me


393
00:19:48.959 --> 00:19:52.755
continues to plummet
and the once hot singer's career


394
00:19:52.838 --> 00:19:55.132
flies into oblivion.

395
00:19:55.215 --> 00:19:58.052
Let's just turn this off, shall we?

396
00:19:58.552 --> 00:20:00.429
I need Guru Peterson, Jimothy!

397
00:20:00.512 --> 00:20:02.348
I called him six times.

398
00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:04.642
It just keeps going to voicemail.

399
00:20:04.725 --> 00:20:07.978
Christmas must be
the busy season for gurus.


400
00:20:08.062 --> 00:20:11.315
Besides, you know,
he'd probably just tell you


401
00:20:11.398 --> 00:20:12.983
that the reason your album flopped

402
00:20:13.067 --> 00:20:16.320
is because you've lost
touch with your fan base.


403
00:20:16.403 --> 00:20:20.658
You're just not relatable
to normal people anymore.


404
00:20:21.575 --> 00:20:25.788
What do you mean by normal exactly?

405
00:20:26.455 --> 00:20:29.750
You know, people who
carry their own luggage.


406
00:20:29.833 --> 00:20:32.252
- Oh.
- People who wear khakis.


407
00:20:32.336 --> 00:20:34.672
People who eat soft serve ice cream.

408
00:20:34.755 --> 00:20:36.595
Please, never say
"soft serve ice cream" again.


409
00:20:41.553 --> 00:20:42.763
You know what I need, Jimothy?

410
00:20:42.846 --> 00:20:44.598
Another makeover?

411
00:20:44.682 --> 00:20:46.225
No.

412
00:20:46.308 --> 00:20:48.352
A make-under.

413
00:20:52.898 --> 00:20:56.443
Kiki? I'm heading out for lunch.
Can you watch the front desk for me?


414
00:20:56.527 --> 00:20:58.127
I should be back in
about an hour or so.

415
00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.534
Actually... make that two.

416
00:21:14.002 --> 00:21:15.963
- Oh, there you are.
- Luke.


417
00:21:16.046 --> 00:21:17.840
Hi. I...

418
00:21:17.923 --> 00:21:19.508
I am heading out for my lunch break.

419
00:21:19.591 --> 00:21:20.884
Wait, wait.

420
00:21:20.968 --> 00:21:22.928
You are going on a lunch break?

421
00:21:23.011 --> 00:21:24.763
Well, it's Christmas.

422
00:21:24.847 --> 00:21:27.266
Wait. Before you go,
I want you to try this new eggnog


423
00:21:27.349 --> 00:21:29.476
I was thinking of serving
at the Jingle Mingle.


424
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.602
I'd love to.

425
00:21:30.686 --> 00:21:32.146
It's my own recipe.

426
00:21:32.229 --> 00:21:35.357
I have an in with the dairy farmer
at the Christmas market.


427
00:21:36.316 --> 00:21:39.611
Oh, my God. This is incredible.

428
00:21:39.695 --> 00:21:41.071
Thank you.

429
00:21:41.155 --> 00:21:42.072
I have to go. I'm sorry.

430
00:21:42.156 --> 00:21:43.907
Oh. Where are you headed?

431
00:21:45.367 --> 00:21:46.201
Out.

432
00:21:46.285 --> 00:21:47.953
Perfect. I'll come with you.

433
00:21:48.036 --> 00:21:49.764
I wanted to grab some stuff
from the market anyway.


434
00:21:49.788 --> 00:21:51.039
No.

435
00:21:51.123 --> 00:21:52.374
No. I...

436
00:21:52.458 --> 00:21:54.793
I don't wanna get in your way.

437
00:21:54.877 --> 00:21:56.545
You're not gonna get in my way.

438
00:21:56.628 --> 00:22:00.007
You're just saying that
to be nice. I'll see you later.


439
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:01.425
Bye.

440
00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:13.145
So you've been
a prince your whole life?


441
00:22:13.228 --> 00:22:15.147
That is generally
how monarchies work, yes.


442
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:16.356
Yeah. I knew that.

443
00:22:17.691 --> 00:22:18.691
Oh.

444
00:22:21.528 --> 00:22:22.529
Force of habit.

445
00:22:22.613 --> 00:22:24.174
He's also my food taster
back at the palace.


446
00:22:24.198 --> 00:22:25.115
Oh.

447
00:22:25.199 --> 00:22:27.242
Oh, I got it. Thanks.

448
00:22:27.326 --> 00:22:29.161
So, um, why did you leave?

449
00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:31.246
Well, that's a good question.

450
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:34.124
I suppose I just
got tired of it all.

451
00:22:34.625 --> 00:22:37.503
I just wanted a change, something new.

452
00:22:37.586 --> 00:22:40.026
Then of course there's my father,
he was in charge of my life.


453
00:22:40.088 --> 00:22:42.090
It's like he's the king or something.

454
00:22:43.675 --> 00:22:46.887
I guess the real truth of it
is that I just got sick and tired


455
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.907
of sharing everything
with 11 brothers and sisters.


456
00:22:48.931 --> 00:22:51.475
I wanted something that was just my own.

457
00:22:53.936 --> 00:22:56.522
Raymond, I have an idea.

458
00:23:06.198 --> 00:23:10.744
You have hoops?
Five of them? And they're golden?


459
00:23:11.912 --> 00:23:13.789
Thank you. I will be right there.

460
00:23:16.583 --> 00:23:17.751
Can I help you?

461
00:23:18.752 --> 00:23:19.795
You don't know who I am?

462
00:23:19.878 --> 00:23:21.255
Should I? Are you a guest here?

463
00:23:21.338 --> 00:23:23.757
I'm Pando... um...

464
00:23:23.841 --> 00:23:25.050
Pam?

465
00:23:25.551 --> 00:23:29.263
Oh, wait. Are you one of the temps
that Georgia hired for the Jingle Mingle?


466
00:23:29.346 --> 00:23:31.515
- Uh...
- The Christmas Eve party?


467
00:23:31.598 --> 00:23:33.141
Uh, yes. Yes.

468
00:23:33.225 --> 00:23:36.103
Uh, yes. Yes, that's it.

469
00:23:36.186 --> 00:23:39.147
I'm a temp.
An absolute normal, everyday temp.


470
00:23:39.231 --> 00:23:40.566
Great. That's perfect.

471
00:23:40.649 --> 00:23:43.670
We got to go because we've got to pick up
something from the Christmas market.


472
00:23:43.694 --> 00:23:45.946
Uh, don't you have people for that?

473
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:48.073
Yeah, us. Come on.

474
00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:56.373
Oh, what, uh, what's this for?

475
00:23:56.456 --> 00:23:59.251
Milton, by the power vested in me

476
00:23:59.334 --> 00:24:01.545
by the Innkeepers Association of America,

477
00:24:01.628 --> 00:24:06.091
I am officially putting you
in charge until I get back.


478
00:24:06.884 --> 00:24:08.385
Wow.

479
00:24:08.468 --> 00:24:09.803
Come on.

480
00:24:17.144 --> 00:24:18.562
Oh.

481
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.316
Bonjour. Joyeux Noel.

482
00:24:22.399 --> 00:24:25.235
This is the Hotel Fontaine,
your home for the holidays.


483
00:24:25.319 --> 00:24:26.820
How may I help you?

484
00:24:36.204 --> 00:24:37.204
- Let's go.
- Oh.


485
00:24:37.247 --> 00:24:39.708
Where's Santa's little helper
going off to this time?


486
00:24:39.791 --> 00:24:41.793
It's a Christmas secret, Santa!

487
00:24:42.544 --> 00:24:44.546
I wonder what
he looks like under the beard?


488
00:24:45.339 --> 00:24:48.216
Dickens... Dickens!

489
00:24:49.134 --> 00:24:50.134
Dickens!

490
00:24:53.388 --> 00:24:56.058
You don't even have to lift
a finger if you don't want to.


491
00:24:56.141 --> 00:24:57.059
You bring the capital.

492
00:24:57.142 --> 00:25:00.562
I'll be the executive director,
and we will split the 49% ownership stake.


493
00:25:00.646 --> 00:25:04.024
To be honest, I'm not exactly looking
to get into the hotel business.


494
00:25:04.107 --> 00:25:05.400
Why not?

495
00:25:05.484 --> 00:25:06.735
Okay. Look down there.

496
00:25:06.818 --> 00:25:08.570
Did you know
that during the holiday season,


497
00:25:08.654 --> 00:25:12.783
an average of 800,000 people
pass through Rockefeller Center every day?


498
00:25:12.866 --> 00:25:16.203
You know, my father
built an indoor rink at the palace once.


499
00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:18.413
First time I tried skating,
I broke my ankle.


500
00:25:19.164 --> 00:25:22.834
The point is, all of those people
need somewhere to stay.


501
00:25:22.918 --> 00:25:26.171
And modern hotels are the fastest growing
segment of the hospitality industry.


502
00:25:26.254 --> 00:25:28.256
I very much appreciate that,

503
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.509
but I don't know
why I would put any roots down here.


504
00:25:30.592 --> 00:25:31.885
I don't know the city at all.

505
00:25:31.969 --> 00:25:33.488
And I'm planning to leave
the day after Christmas.


506
00:25:33.512 --> 00:25:35.806
Which gives me just enough
time to show you around.


507
00:25:35.889 --> 00:25:39.226
- But I...
- Will you at least give it a chance?


508
00:25:39.309 --> 00:25:41.029
Look, if I don't convince
you that this city


509
00:25:41.103 --> 00:25:43.021
is a good investment by Christmas,

510
00:25:43.438 --> 00:25:46.441
you can hop on your jet and fly off
to anywhere else in the world.


511
00:25:46.942 --> 00:25:48.110
But...

512
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:50.529
if you fall in love with New York...

513
00:25:50.612 --> 00:25:51.947
I must warn you.

514
00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:55.534
I was a prince,
so I'm pretty difficult to impress.


515
00:25:56.118 --> 00:25:57.869
Clearly, you've never met New York.

516
00:25:58.286 --> 00:25:59.287
Deal?

517
00:26:04.543 --> 00:26:05.711
So you've seen my jet?

518
00:26:19.391 --> 00:26:22.269
Do you think these like geese
need to actually lay the eggs


519
00:26:22.352 --> 00:26:24.414
or do you think they can
kind of just sit on top of them?


520
00:26:24.438 --> 00:26:26.648
I feel like it's gonna be
kind of hard to...


521
00:26:26.732 --> 00:26:29.401
do you remember
how excited you used to get


522
00:26:29.484 --> 00:26:31.028
about Christmas when you were a kid?

523
00:26:32.112 --> 00:26:34.948
Actually, I don't.

524
00:26:35.407 --> 00:26:38.452
Wow. Christmas buzzkill.

525
00:26:38.535 --> 00:26:39.995
Come on.

526
00:26:40.078 --> 00:26:42.998
Honestly, there wasn't much time

527
00:26:43.081 --> 00:26:45.083
between the dance rehearsals,

528
00:26:45.167 --> 00:26:47.461
and singing classes, and piano lessons.

529
00:26:48.045 --> 00:26:50.380
You know, like, like any normal kid.

530
00:26:50.922 --> 00:26:53.759
Well, in that case,
we need to make up for lost time.


531
00:26:53.842 --> 00:26:55.719
We start with the head first.

532
00:26:58.346 --> 00:27:00.265
Oh, no, I can't.

533
00:27:00.348 --> 00:27:02.809
That is nothing but sugar and baked lard.

534
00:27:02.893 --> 00:27:05.479
Yeah, that's basically what Christmas is.

535
00:27:06.188 --> 00:27:09.399
Come on. I know the best
hot chocolate stand in the city.


536
00:27:19.743 --> 00:27:22.329
Hey, buddy. You lost?

537
00:27:24.664 --> 00:27:25.749
Dickens...

538
00:27:25.832 --> 00:27:27.334
Well, it is Christmas.

539
00:27:28.043 --> 00:27:29.920
Okay, Dickens,
let's find out where you live.


540
00:27:30.003 --> 00:27:33.131
They say that a million kids
visit this market at Christmas.


541
00:27:33.215 --> 00:27:36.635
In fact, over 60 million
tourists visit New York City


542
00:27:36.718 --> 00:27:38.470
every year, all year round.

543
00:27:38.553 --> 00:27:41.598
And you just have this
information at your fingertips?


544
00:27:41.681 --> 00:27:47.145
I have been working on this
proposal for a really, really long time.


545
00:27:47.687 --> 00:27:50.524
- I have done my research.
- Yes, I can see that.


546
00:27:51.316 --> 00:27:55.320
This new hotel isn't just
a real estate investment for you, is it?


547
00:27:55.403 --> 00:27:57.280
No... no.

548
00:27:57.364 --> 00:27:58.615
It...

549
00:27:58.698 --> 00:28:00.158
it means the world to me.

550
00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:03.745
Look, Georgia,
I appreciate your enthusiasm.


551
00:28:04.246 --> 00:28:07.666
And New York is obviously
a massive tourist destination.


552
00:28:07.749 --> 00:28:08.917
But...

553
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.503
the truth is, I'm just not sure

554
00:28:11.586 --> 00:28:13.386
I'm looking to invest
in a business right now.


555
00:28:14.548 --> 00:28:15.590
I see.

556
00:28:16.675 --> 00:28:20.428
Do you mean right now, right now
or do you mean right now as in never?


557
00:28:21.596 --> 00:28:24.224
You know what?
Why don't we discuss this over dinner?


558
00:28:24.307 --> 00:28:26.017
I would like that.

559
00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.412
I've never had dinner
with a real prince before.


560
00:28:28.436 --> 00:28:29.872
Well, then we're even,
I've never had dinner


561
00:28:29.896 --> 00:28:31.216
with a real hotel manager before.

562
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:33.775
How about 8:00?

563
00:28:33.859 --> 00:28:36.278
And seeing as you're the authority
on all things New York,


564
00:28:36.361 --> 00:28:37.588
I'll leave the where
of it up to you.

565
00:28:37.612 --> 00:28:39.239
That is easy.

566
00:28:39.322 --> 00:28:41.324
I just happen to know
the best chef in town.


567
00:28:42.659 --> 00:28:43.952
A prince?

568
00:28:44.035 --> 00:28:45.287
He used to be.

569
00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:46.663
He used to be?

570
00:28:46.746 --> 00:28:48.474
I didn't know
you could "use to be" a prince.


571
00:28:48.498 --> 00:28:51.251
The thing is, he doesn't want
anybody to know about it.


572
00:28:51.334 --> 00:28:53.170
So we need to eat somewhere private.

573
00:28:53.253 --> 00:28:55.881
There will only be two of us.
Well, three of us, technically,


574
00:28:55.964 --> 00:28:57.757
but I don't think his
bodyguard eats anything


575
00:28:57.841 --> 00:28:59.485
but protein shakes and the occasional cow.

576
00:28:59.509 --> 00:29:01.511
How did you end up
having dinner with this guy?


577
00:29:03.305 --> 00:29:05.390
You know, it's kind of complicated.

578
00:29:05.473 --> 00:29:07.017
Can we just do 8:00, please?

579
00:29:08.393 --> 00:29:10.270
Yes, we sure can.

580
00:29:10.353 --> 00:29:12.147
You're the best. 
Thank you so much.

581
00:29:13.398 --> 00:29:15.525
- How's the broth, chef?
- Good, chef.


582
00:29:15.609 --> 00:29:18.069
Oh, also, remember he is royalty,

583
00:29:18.153 --> 00:29:20.464
so I need you to make us something
that's really going to impress him.


584
00:29:20.488 --> 00:29:22.240
He's back to being a prince now?

585
00:29:24.618 --> 00:29:25.660
No problem, G.

586
00:29:25.744 --> 00:29:27.245
Bring him to the roof at 8:00.

587
00:29:28.663 --> 00:29:29.664
The roof?

588
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.875
You said private?

589
00:29:32.709 --> 00:29:34.419
Well, yeah but...

590
00:29:34.502 --> 00:29:37.714
Don't worry about a thing, okay?

591
00:29:37.797 --> 00:29:39.841
I am making the
best dinner he's ever had.

592
00:29:40.759 --> 00:29:42.677
What would I ever do without you, Luke?

593
00:29:43.345 --> 00:29:44.346
Thank you.

594
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.227
What are you looking at?

595
00:29:51.228 --> 00:29:53.396
Come on. We got dinner to make, chef.

596
00:30:03.031 --> 00:30:06.034
We still need to get the inflatable pool
for the swimming swans


597
00:30:06.117 --> 00:30:07.452
and, of course, the swans,

598
00:30:07.535 --> 00:30:09.204
so we better get an early start tomorrow.

599
00:30:09.287 --> 00:30:11.331
I will see you
in the morning at 8:00.

600
00:30:11.414 --> 00:30:12.582
Don't be silly.

601
00:30:12.666 --> 00:30:14.751
8:00 doesn't come in the morning.

602
00:30:16.628 --> 00:30:18.004
Does it?

603
00:30:18.088 --> 00:30:19.965
Kiki, what are you doing?

604
00:30:20.048 --> 00:30:21.758
- Didn't Milton tell you?
- Tell me what?


605
00:30:21.841 --> 00:30:23.277
I put him in
charge of the front desk.

606
00:30:23.301 --> 00:30:24.654
I gave him the badge and everything.

607
00:30:24.678 --> 00:30:27.305
Kiki, I love Milton,
but he already has a job.


608
00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:29.808
This hotel will literally
fall apart without him.


609
00:30:29.891 --> 00:30:31.577
He doesn't have time
to be checking in guests.


610
00:30:31.601 --> 00:30:33.853
Okay. But he's doing
a great job at the front desk.


611
00:30:33.937 --> 00:30:35.563
Kiki, that's not the point.

612
00:30:35.647 --> 00:30:38.400
The point is that this isn't how
you're supposed to run a hotel.


613
00:30:38.483 --> 00:30:42.028
Okay, Georgia, you know
the Fontaine isn't like other hotels.


614
00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.531
You're right.

615
00:30:44.614 --> 00:30:45.615
It isn't.

616
00:30:45.699 --> 00:30:47.158
I can't wait to get out of here.

617
00:30:48.493 --> 00:30:49.828
Can't wait to what?

618
00:30:50.537 --> 00:30:51.746
Georgia.

619
00:30:52.455 --> 00:30:53.790
Georgia.

620
00:30:54.666 --> 00:30:55.709
Georgia, wait.

621
00:30:55.792 --> 00:30:57.294
- Are you Kiki?
- Yeah.


622
00:30:57.377 --> 00:30:59.004
Sign here for you geese.

623
00:30:59.087 --> 00:31:00.297
Oh.

624
00:31:02.716 --> 00:31:03.800
Thank you.

625
00:31:15.854 --> 00:31:19.899
Thanks, Milton.
I could never get these things to work...


626
00:31:24.112 --> 00:31:25.112
Wow.

627
00:31:26.031 --> 00:31:27.240
Wow.

628
00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.100
Do I look okay? 
You look more than okay.

629
00:31:36.124 --> 00:31:37.751
You look...

630
00:31:37.834 --> 00:31:40.086
more than okay.

631
00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:44.215
You look... you look more than okay.

632
00:31:44.299 --> 00:31:45.550
Thanks.

633
00:31:45.842 --> 00:31:47.510
I really wanna make a good impression.

634
00:31:47.594 --> 00:31:49.929
Yeah, of course.
I mean, he's a prince, right?


635
00:31:50.013 --> 00:31:52.349
It's not like you're having
dinner with some commoner.


636
00:31:54.351 --> 00:31:55.769
I'll see you upstairs.

637
00:31:55.852 --> 00:31:57.729
Yeah. Yeah, see you upstairs.

638
00:32:00.815 --> 00:32:03.068
I think it's a bit of a pity
you're not dining together.


639
00:32:03.735 --> 00:32:06.446
Yeah. We're just friends, Milton.

640
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:08.448
What makes you think
we should be together?


641
00:32:08.531 --> 00:32:11.034
Oh, I don't think you should be together.

642
00:32:12.035 --> 00:32:14.662
Everybody thinks you should be together.

643
00:32:29.177 --> 00:32:31.179
Where have you been all day?

644
00:32:31.888 --> 00:32:33.973
I went to a Christmas market.

645
00:32:35.016 --> 00:32:36.016
Excuse me?

646
00:32:36.476 --> 00:32:37.644
I even ate a gingerbread man

647
00:32:37.727 --> 00:32:40.480
that I'm almost 100% certain
was not gluten-free.


648
00:32:41.439 --> 00:32:43.900
So why can't I come
up with a new song?

649
00:32:43.983 --> 00:32:46.569
Maybe this will inspire you.

650
00:32:46.653 --> 00:32:47.779
Look.

651
00:32:47.862 --> 00:32:51.533
I bought you more nice, normal
clothes for you to wear for Christmas.


652
00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.326
Oh.

653
00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.911
Ho, ho, ho!

654
00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:58.456
This is a disaster.

655
00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.668
If I don't have a new hit song soon,
my career is over.


656
00:33:02.585 --> 00:33:04.337
What am I gonna do?

657
00:33:12.303 --> 00:33:13.303
Hmm...

658
00:33:14.097 --> 00:33:16.850
Just, um, put that on my bill.

659
00:33:16.933 --> 00:33:19.936
Good evening, mademoiselle, and monsieur,

660
00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:22.272
and monster.

661
00:33:22.355 --> 00:33:23.773
Welcome to Restaurant de Luke.

662
00:33:23.857 --> 00:33:24.857
Follow me.

663
00:33:28.278 --> 00:33:30.530
Prince, sorry, Raymond,

664
00:33:30.613 --> 00:33:33.658
allow me to introduce you to Chef Luke.

665
00:33:33.741 --> 00:33:34.821
Pleasure to meet you, Chef.

666
00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:37.036
And you...

667
00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.039
you are welcome here.

668
00:33:40.123 --> 00:33:42.375
Welcome. Thank you.

669
00:33:42.459 --> 00:33:43.918
Please.

670
00:33:44.002 --> 00:33:46.504
Raymond is visiting New York City

671
00:33:46.588 --> 00:33:47.589
for the first time, Luke.

672
00:33:47.672 --> 00:33:49.257
- Oh, is he?
- Yeah.


673
00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.927
And yet it seems as though
he's made himself right at home.


674
00:33:54.095 --> 00:33:56.639
Well, it's an easy city to love.

675
00:33:56.723 --> 00:33:58.724
- Not if it doesn't love you back.
- Chef Luke.


676
00:33:58.808 --> 00:34:02.061
I'm sure you have things
to do in the kitchen.


677
00:34:02.145 --> 00:34:03.228
Don't let us keep you.

678
00:34:03.313 --> 00:34:04.981
Yes. Yes, of course.

679
00:34:05.063 --> 00:34:06.648
Enjoy your wine.

680
00:34:06.733 --> 00:34:07.734
Yeah.

681
00:34:11.445 --> 00:34:12.864
Do you know who that is?

682
00:34:12.947 --> 00:34:14.741
- Georgia said he was a prince.
- Yeah.


683
00:34:14.824 --> 00:34:16.868
He's also the guy
that was with her this afternoon.


684
00:34:17.784 --> 00:34:18.828
What does that matter?

685
00:34:18.912 --> 00:34:20.163
They're just having dinner.

686
00:34:20.246 --> 00:34:22.123
This isn't just dinner.

687
00:34:22.206 --> 00:34:23.333
Look at this.

688
00:34:23.416 --> 00:34:24.791
Okay. Well, whatever it is,

689
00:34:24.876 --> 00:34:27.086
the lobster appetizers are ready to serve.

690
00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.731
You want me to
fire up them fillets now?

691
00:34:28.755 --> 00:34:29.964
The fillet?

692
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.300
No, no, no, no, no.

693
00:34:33.384 --> 00:34:34.744
There's gonna be a change of menu.

694
00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:39.557
To our partnership.

695
00:34:39.641 --> 00:34:41.351
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

696
00:34:41.434 --> 00:34:43.061
I haven't made my decision yet.

697
00:34:44.187 --> 00:34:45.563
Right.

698
00:34:45.647 --> 00:34:48.191
My father always says
it's best to discuss business


699
00:34:48.274 --> 00:34:49.484
on a full stomach.

700
00:34:49.567 --> 00:34:51.212
One of the few things
we actually agree on.


701
00:34:51.236 --> 00:34:54.239
You know, I would really appreciate it

702
00:34:54.322 --> 00:34:58.326
if we could keep all of this
between the two of us.


703
00:34:58.409 --> 00:35:02.121
I'm not ready to tell
the hotel staff about it yet.


704
00:35:04.582 --> 00:35:05.917
We'll keep it between us then.

705
00:35:06.751 --> 00:35:07.877
Your secret is safe with me.

706
00:35:07.961 --> 00:35:09.045
Thank you.

707
00:35:14.467 --> 00:35:17.720
It must have been fun
growing up in a palace?


708
00:35:17.804 --> 00:35:19.264
Not always.

709
00:35:20.014 --> 00:35:22.892
There are very strict rules, curfews,

710
00:35:22.976 --> 00:35:25.353
elocution lessons, apparel guidelines.

711
00:35:25.895 --> 00:35:28.565
You know, I've never worn
sweatpants in my life.


712
00:35:28.648 --> 00:35:30.483
Criminal.

713
00:35:30.567 --> 00:35:31.776
No wonder you ran away.

714
00:35:31.859 --> 00:35:33.611
I'm aware of how that sounds.

715
00:35:33.695 --> 00:35:34.862
No, actually, I...

716
00:35:34.946 --> 00:35:36.447
I really, really get it.

717
00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.324
When I moved to New York,

718
00:35:38.408 --> 00:35:41.536
it was like the first
independent thing I ever did.


719
00:35:43.037 --> 00:35:45.039
It was like I
finally owned my own life.

720
00:35:46.124 --> 00:35:47.724
And now, you want
to own your own hotel.

721
00:35:49.752 --> 00:35:51.629
Dinner is served.

722
00:35:51.713 --> 00:35:52.797
Oh, fantastic.

723
00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.215
I'm obviously famished.

724
00:35:55.133 --> 00:35:58.386
Tonight's specialty of the house
is an old New York City recipe


725
00:35:58.469 --> 00:36:01.347
that's been passed down
in my family for generations.


726
00:36:01.431 --> 00:36:03.933
We only use farm to table ingredients

727
00:36:04.017 --> 00:36:08.146
that have been handcrafted
with artisanal attention to detail


728
00:36:08.229 --> 00:36:12.692
and served at a perfect
temperature of 104 degrees.


729
00:36:13.443 --> 00:36:14.652
I present to you...

730
00:36:16.154 --> 00:36:17.614
- Pizza.
- Pizza.


731
00:36:17.697 --> 00:36:20.283
Yes. Well, we also have a selection

732
00:36:20.366 --> 00:36:22.744
of curated toppings.

733
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:26.706
I would recommend...

734
00:36:27.749 --> 00:36:30.501
the, uh, cracked pepper, of course,

735
00:36:30.585 --> 00:36:32.211
simpler is always better.

736
00:36:32.295 --> 00:36:33.630
Don't you agree?

737
00:36:33.713 --> 00:36:38.259
Chef Luke, may I
have a word in private?

738
00:36:38.343 --> 00:36:40.011
- Of course.
- Excuse us.


739
00:36:41.929 --> 00:36:44.807
After everything we spoke about
and you served him pizza?


740
00:36:44.891 --> 00:36:47.018
I thought you said
you always liked my pizza, G?


741
00:36:47.101 --> 00:36:49.103
Are you trying to ruin this for me?

742
00:36:49.187 --> 00:36:52.148
This? I... I don't even know what this is
because you won't tell me.


743
00:36:53.441 --> 00:36:56.194
I can't, okay? I'm sorry. Not yet.

744
00:36:56.277 --> 00:36:57.837
It's just... it's really important to me.

745
00:36:57.862 --> 00:37:00.102
Yeah, well, it must be.
You spent the whole day together.


746
00:37:00.406 --> 00:37:02.033
What? How do you know that?

747
00:37:03.743 --> 00:37:05.078
Because I saw you.

748
00:37:05.787 --> 00:37:08.373
Are you spying on me?

749
00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.918
Spy... don't try to change
the subject, all right?


750
00:37:12.001 --> 00:37:13.628
I saw him kiss your hand.

751
00:37:13.711 --> 00:37:15.380
He's a prince. 
That's what they do.

752
00:37:15.963 --> 00:37:17.965
Besides what difference
does it make to you anyway?


753
00:37:20.259 --> 00:37:21.928
Oh, nothing... none, none.

754
00:37:22.011 --> 00:37:23.513
It makes no difference to me.

755
00:37:24.347 --> 00:37:26.140
Raymond. Hi.

756
00:37:26.224 --> 00:37:28.643
Sorry. There was an
emergency in the kitchen,


757
00:37:28.726 --> 00:37:29.912
but I will be
right back at the table.

758
00:37:29.936 --> 00:37:31.789
Well, you better hurry up.
There's not gonna be any left.


759
00:37:31.813 --> 00:37:33.731
I was never allowed to eat
pizza at the palace.


760
00:37:33.815 --> 00:37:35.125
They say it wasn't fit for a prince.

761
00:37:35.149 --> 00:37:37.068
But this, Chef Luke. Hmm.

762
00:37:37.652 --> 00:37:38.778
This is incredible.

763
00:37:38.861 --> 00:37:40.738
This is one of the most delicious meals

764
00:37:40.822 --> 00:37:43.491
I think I've ever tasted
in my life, so bravo.


765
00:37:43.574 --> 00:37:45.868
Uh, thank you. Thanks.

766
00:37:45.952 --> 00:37:48.579
If this is any indication
of New York City cuisine,


767
00:37:48.663 --> 00:37:49.956
might've stick around after all.

768
00:37:53.793 --> 00:37:55.294
I have to get back to the table.

769
00:37:56.129 --> 00:37:57.630
My pizza's getting cold.

770
00:37:58.673 --> 00:38:00.258
G.

771
00:38:05.263 --> 00:38:06.389
Sorry, brother.

772
00:38:06.472 --> 00:38:07.473
Come on.

773
00:38:07.557 --> 00:38:08.891
Let's go.

774
00:38:12.019 --> 00:38:13.646
No, it's okay.

775
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:14.939
Yeah. I love you.

776
00:38:23.573 --> 00:38:24.866
Everything okay, Flo?

777
00:38:24.949 --> 00:38:27.577
Yeah. Oh, yeah, everything's fine.

778
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.664
Just my son and my daughter-in-law
aren't gonna be able to make it in


779
00:38:31.748 --> 00:38:33.875
for Christmas dinner after all, so...

780
00:38:33.958 --> 00:38:35.084
I'm sorry.

781
00:38:35.168 --> 00:38:39.505
Yeah. Which leaves me
with a whole lot of turkey for one person.


782
00:38:41.966 --> 00:38:43.384
So you done for the night?

783
00:38:43.468 --> 00:38:49.348
Yeah. Uh, pretty cold out there, so I sure
am glad I have this beautiful new scarf.


784
00:38:49.432 --> 00:38:52.059
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's very becoming on you.


785
00:38:52.143 --> 00:38:53.143
Oh, thank you.

786
00:38:59.025 --> 00:39:00.276
Well, good night, Milton.

787
00:39:01.319 --> 00:39:03.237
Well, have a good night, Flo.

788
00:39:08.242 --> 00:39:09.285
Good night, Anna.

789
00:39:09.368 --> 00:39:10.787
Good night.

790
00:39:24.634 --> 00:39:26.093
Oh...

791
00:39:27.011 --> 00:39:28.763
Oh, no.

792
00:39:29.263 --> 00:39:31.265
My gift for Victor...

793
00:39:38.064 --> 00:39:42.026
You know, I don't think
your Chef Luke like me very much.


794
00:39:42.944 --> 00:39:44.987
No. I wouldn't say that.

795
00:39:45.071 --> 00:39:47.573
Luke is just passionate.

796
00:39:48.032 --> 00:39:49.742
You know how chefs are.

797
00:39:49.826 --> 00:39:51.619
So you've known him
for a long time then?

798
00:39:52.286 --> 00:39:57.291
I've been friends with Luke
for a very long time.


799
00:39:58.876 --> 00:40:01.128
I can't even imagine
the hotel without him.


800
00:40:02.088 --> 00:40:03.673
Just friends?

801
00:40:08.719 --> 00:40:10.847
Oh, my gosh.
I love that window.


802
00:40:17.895 --> 00:40:21.148
You know, I heard that there are
over eight million mechanical elves


803
00:40:21.232 --> 00:40:22.584
in New York City on a given moment.

804
00:40:22.608 --> 00:40:23.651
Ha-ha.

805
00:40:23.734 --> 00:40:25.796
You're not the only
one with information at their fingertips.


806
00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.155
I am just trying to help you
make a sound business decision


807
00:40:28.239 --> 00:40:29.532
based on facts and logic.

808
00:40:30.992 --> 00:40:33.452
The truth is, I haven't made
many big decisions in my life.


809
00:40:34.287 --> 00:40:39.333
My last one, abdicating the throne,
wasn't based in logic at all.


810
00:40:39.417 --> 00:40:42.587
I guess that's going to be true
of my next decision, too.


811
00:40:44.672 --> 00:40:46.007
Are you serious?

812
00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:48.134
Very.

813
00:40:49.135 --> 00:40:50.553
I looked at your proposal.

814
00:40:50.636 --> 00:40:52.638
I think you'd be a great business partner.

815
00:40:53.514 --> 00:40:55.514
You're not kidding, right?
He's not kidding, right?


816
00:40:55.766 --> 00:40:56.934
No.

817
00:40:57.518 --> 00:40:58.436
Not kidding.

818
00:40:58.519 --> 00:41:00.521
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.


819
00:41:00.605 --> 00:41:02.315
Careful.

820
00:41:02.398 --> 00:41:04.233
You know, there are paparazzis hiding.

821
00:41:04.317 --> 00:41:06.611
We don't want anyone
to get the wrong idea.


822
00:41:06.694 --> 00:41:07.945
Sorry.

823
00:41:09.447 --> 00:41:12.658
This is going to be
the best Christmas ever.


824
00:41:18.789 --> 00:41:21.959
So the Prince has
agreed to invest half the cost


825
00:41:22.043 --> 00:41:26.047
But I heard that Prince Raymond
has left the throne,


826
00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:28.758
didn't want to be a part
of the royal family anymore.


827
00:41:29.634 --> 00:41:30.801
Silly boy.

828
00:41:30.885 --> 00:41:33.971
Well, yes, but he is looking
to expand his interests.


829
00:41:34.055 --> 00:41:36.724
The thing is, he is leaving New York
right after Christmas, so...


830
00:41:36.807 --> 00:41:37.975
So in that case,

831
00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:39.644
I suggest...

832
00:41:40.353 --> 00:41:43.105
Jean
-Luc, I'm thirsty.

833
00:41:44.273 --> 00:41:45.691
Yes. What do you suggest?

834
00:41:45.775 --> 00:41:49.111
I suggest you
open a bottle of Champagne.


835
00:41:49.987 --> 00:41:51.489
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

836
00:41:51.572 --> 00:41:53.372
Thank you, Madame Fontaine.
Thank you so much.


837
00:41:53.449 --> 00:41:54.992
Oh, don't thank me.

838
00:41:55.076 --> 00:41:56.327
Thank your prince.

839
00:42:00.915 --> 00:42:05.294
Now, go find us a shiny new hotel.

840
00:42:06.128 --> 00:42:07.213
Okay.

841
00:42:09.507 --> 00:42:11.968
♪ Deck the halls
with boughs of holly ♪

842
00:42:12.051 --> 00:42:14.303

843
00:42:14.387 --> 00:42:15.554
Hey. Hi.

844
00:42:15.638 --> 00:42:16.681
I'm in the lobby.

845
00:42:17.056 --> 00:42:18.140
Where are you?

846
00:42:23.396 --> 00:42:24.397
Dickens...

847
00:42:25.022 --> 00:42:26.148
Hey. Thank you.

848
00:42:26.232 --> 00:42:28.025
Hey, I missed you so much.

849
00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.987
You must have been worried sick.

850
00:42:31.612 --> 00:42:33.322
Yeah. Do you have a dog?

851
00:42:33.406 --> 00:42:35.074
No, my apartment is too small.

852
00:42:35.157 --> 00:42:36.492
Even my plants complain.

853
00:42:37.952 --> 00:42:39.203
He never used to run away.

854
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:44.000
But he's been acting out ever since
his other daddy and I broke up.


855
00:42:47.128 --> 00:42:49.106
I hope you don't mind.
It was pretty cold out there


856
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:50.673
so I, uh, got him a coat.

857
00:42:50.756 --> 00:42:52.717
There are matching boots too,

858
00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.427
in case you ever want the full outfit.

859
00:42:55.761 --> 00:42:58.097
Uh, I'll think about it.

860
00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:00.141
- How much do I owe you?
- Forget about it.


861
00:43:00.766 --> 00:43:03.144
Think of it as an early Christmas gift

862
00:43:03.227 --> 00:43:05.646
from one divorcee to another.

863
00:43:07.398 --> 00:43:09.442
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.


864
00:43:11.485 --> 00:43:15.239
Uh, I hear this Jingle Mingle party
they put on every Christmas is pretty fun.


865
00:43:15.614 --> 00:43:17.742
If you're still in town,
maybe we could check it out.


866
00:43:19.118 --> 00:43:21.912
Oh, um, thanks.

867
00:43:21.996 --> 00:43:23.289
But no, I... I can't.

868
00:43:23.956 --> 00:43:25.583
Oh, okay. I understand.

869
00:43:25.666 --> 00:43:27.626
I... I mean, I have work stuff

870
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:29.045
that I got to get done, you know.

871
00:43:30.504 --> 00:43:31.839
No problem.

872
00:43:32.757 --> 00:43:36.302
Well, take care
of your dad, Dickens.


873
00:43:37.928 --> 00:43:39.221
It was nice meeting you, AJ.

874
00:43:40.639 --> 00:43:41.682
You too.

875
00:43:42.391 --> 00:43:43.391
Merry Christmas.

876
00:43:44.602 --> 00:43:45.728
Merry Christmas.

877
00:43:50.983 --> 00:43:51.984

878
00:43:52.068 --> 00:43:54.945
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la... ♪♪

879
00:43:55.029 --> 00:43:57.323
What do you think
he meant by sticking around?


880
00:43:57.406 --> 00:43:59.950
Probably means he's gonna stick around.

881
00:44:00.034 --> 00:44:02.328
You saw the way he and Georgia
were looking at each other.


882
00:44:02.953 --> 00:44:04.431
You dropped the ball on this one Luke

883
00:44:04.455 --> 00:44:06.624
and prince charming
was right there to pick it up.


884
00:44:06.707 --> 00:44:07.750
Victor, I told you.

885
00:44:07.833 --> 00:44:11.128
Georgia and I are just good friends.

886
00:44:12.838 --> 00:44:15.591
Nobody believes that
except for you and Georgia.


887
00:44:15.674 --> 00:44:17.510
And the only reason why she does

888
00:44:17.593 --> 00:44:19.804
is because you haven't
told her how you really feel.


889
00:44:19.887 --> 00:44:21.639
Maybe I don't know how I really feel.

890
00:44:22.973 --> 00:44:23.974
I do.

891
00:44:24.558 --> 00:44:26.852
You feel like you
wanna make lunch for her

892
00:44:26.936 --> 00:44:29.772
every single day
for the rest of your lives.


893
00:44:30.773 --> 00:44:32.566
And if that ain't love, brother,

894
00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:34.026
I don't know what it is.

895
00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:37.404
So, what am I
supposed to do about it?

896
00:44:37.488 --> 00:44:41.075
I'm no Prince, retired, or otherwise.

897
00:44:41.158 --> 00:44:42.243
You're gonna go down there,

898
00:44:42.326 --> 00:44:43.786
you're gonna give her this sandwich,

899
00:44:43.869 --> 00:44:46.038
and you're going to tell her the truth.

900
00:44:46.956 --> 00:44:47.957
The truth.

901
00:44:51.627 --> 00:44:53.003
You got this.

902
00:44:54.255 --> 00:44:56.882
Hey, I need to hire
eight more temps for the party


903
00:44:56.966 --> 00:44:58.485
and they have to dress like milk-maids.

904
00:44:58.509 --> 00:44:59.510
Sure. Okay.

905
00:44:59.593 --> 00:45:00.636
Thanks.

906
00:45:00.719 --> 00:45:02.972
And I'm really sorry about
not being here yesterday.


907
00:45:03.556 --> 00:45:05.316
Don't worry about it.
Milton did a great job.


908
00:45:05.391 --> 00:45:07.471
- Oh, so, you're not upset.
- No. Of course, I'm not.


909
00:45:07.518 --> 00:45:09.955
Oh, I thought you were mad, when you said
"I couldn't wait to get out of here."


910
00:45:09.979 --> 00:45:12.064
Oh, that, that's just a figure of speech.

911
00:45:12.148 --> 00:45:14.400
Um, I have to run
and do some Christmas errands.


912
00:45:14.483 --> 00:45:16.068
- I'll be back later, okay?
- Okay.


913
00:45:16.152 --> 00:45:18.821
Oh, wait. I also need nine ballerinas.

914
00:45:30.624 --> 00:45:32.918
"Executive Director Georgia Clark"?

915
00:45:40.593 --> 00:45:42.469
- Georgia. Georgia.
- Oh, Luke.


916
00:45:42.553 --> 00:45:44.531
Sorry, I have to run out
to go to lunch. I don't...


917
00:45:44.555 --> 00:45:46.765
Oh, going out to lunch again,
getting to be a habit.


918
00:45:48.851 --> 00:45:50.686
Look, I'm sorry, okay,

919
00:45:50.769 --> 00:45:52.980
about last night with you and the prince.

920
00:45:53.063 --> 00:45:55.357
I behaved immaturely
and I wanted to apologize.


921
00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:57.484
- It's okay, really. Don't worry...
- No, it isn't.


922
00:45:57.568 --> 00:45:58.652
It isn't, really.

923
00:45:59.612 --> 00:46:02.448
The thing is,
I acted like that because I...


924
00:46:04.158 --> 00:46:07.036
we, you know, you
and me, we... uh, us.

925
00:46:07.119 --> 00:46:09.538
- Yeah.
- Ah, there you are.


926
00:46:09.622 --> 00:46:10.956
- Hi.
- Chef.


927
00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.250
- The car's waiting for us.
- Oh, I'll be right there.


928
00:46:14.835 --> 00:46:16.646
Luke, can we pick this up later?
I have to run.


929
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:17.796
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

930
00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:19.882
You, you got things to do, busy-bee...

931
00:46:22.092 --> 00:46:23.135
Hey.

932
00:46:23.844 --> 00:46:24.887
Everything okay?

933
00:46:25.554 --> 00:46:28.015
Yeah. Everything's fine.
Here, you want a sandwich?


934
00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:30.643
- Yeah, it's just...
- Oh, okay. Sure. Yeah.


935
00:46:31.477 --> 00:46:33.771
- And, uh, the spices for it, so.
- Okay.


936
00:46:33.854 --> 00:46:34.897
Oh, okay.

937
00:46:39.568 --> 00:46:41.862
That's, uh, Ms. 
Kelly, room 304.

938
00:46:41.946 --> 00:46:42.986
- Oh, Anna. Good.
- Uh-hmm.


939
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:45.157
Uh, apparently, uh,
some of our guests have spotted


940
00:46:45.241 --> 00:46:48.077
some goose droppings in the East Corridor.

941
00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.040
- Well, if you can tidy that up, please?
- Sure.


942
00:46:50.079 --> 00:46:51.681
But, Milton, I have to talk to you
about something.


943
00:46:51.705 --> 00:46:53.749
Oh, dear, that sounds important.

944
00:46:53.832 --> 00:46:56.126
It is. Uh, it's actually about your scarf.

945
00:46:56.210 --> 00:46:57.753
Oh, do you like it?

946
00:46:57.836 --> 00:47:01.173
A secret admirer left it
for me in the supply closet.


947
00:47:02.091 --> 00:47:04.009
Confidentially, 
I think it was Florence.

948
00:47:04.093 --> 00:47:05.552
- Florence?
- Uh-hmm.


949
00:47:05.636 --> 00:47:07.763
You know, actually, Anna,
I could use your help.


950
00:47:07.846 --> 00:47:09.848
I wanna do something nice for her,

951
00:47:09.932 --> 00:47:12.393
but, well, my dating
game is a little rusty.


952
00:47:12.476 --> 00:47:14.853
It's, uh, been 12 years
since my wife passed


953
00:47:14.937 --> 00:47:17.898
and, uh, well, it's been some time
since I've had to do anything like this.


954
00:47:17.982 --> 00:47:18.982
Do you have any ideas?

955
00:47:20.067 --> 00:47:21.402
Actually, Milton.

956
00:47:22.111 --> 00:47:23.362
The scarf was from me.

957
00:47:24.154 --> 00:47:25.197
What?

958
00:47:27.199 --> 00:47:28.450
I bought it for Victor.

959
00:47:28.534 --> 00:47:31.829
I was hiding it in the supply closet
to give to him on Christmas Eve.


960
00:47:32.329 --> 00:47:34.373
But I found it first.

961
00:47:36.583 --> 00:47:38.585
- I am so sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.


962
00:47:38.669 --> 00:47:40.212
Anna, this is not your fault at all.

963
00:47:41.672 --> 00:47:43.382
Silly of me, anyway.

964
00:47:43.799 --> 00:47:47.386
Imagine me
having a secret admirer at my age.


965
00:47:49.513 --> 00:47:51.265
Well, uh, back to work.

966
00:48:10.409 --> 00:48:11.952
You're one lucky dog, Dickens,

967
00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:14.371
being found by such a nice guy.

968
00:48:20.085 --> 00:48:21.337
Oh...

969
00:48:24.173 --> 00:48:26.133
He's even got good taste in clothes.

970
00:48:33.557 --> 00:48:36.060
I just can't believe
Georgia wouldn't tell me


971
00:48:36.143 --> 00:48:37.936
she's planning to leave the hotel.

972
00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.481
Maybe she wanted to keep it a secret.

973
00:48:40.564 --> 00:48:43.359
People keep secrets
from each other all the time, right?


974
00:48:43.442 --> 00:48:45.819
Even when they're
supposed to be best friends?


975
00:48:45.903 --> 00:48:46.945
I don't know.

976
00:48:47.029 --> 00:48:49.531
I never really had
time for a best friend.

977
00:48:49.615 --> 00:48:52.493
Well, I am in the market
for a new one, if you're interested.


978
00:48:52.576 --> 00:48:53.577
Thanks.

979
00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.537
Come on. You're gonna help me with these.

980
00:48:57.623 --> 00:49:00.167
Um, what am I supposed to do?

981
00:49:00.834 --> 00:49:02.228
Oh, we're gonna decorate the cookies

982
00:49:02.252 --> 00:49:03.980
and then put them on the tree
for the Jingle Mingle.


983
00:49:04.004 --> 00:49:06.215
Oh, no, no, no. I better not.

984
00:49:06.298 --> 00:49:08.634
Why not? It's Christmas tradition.

985
00:49:09.635 --> 00:49:12.179
But what if I don't do it right?

986
00:49:12.262 --> 00:49:13.972
What if my cookies are a huge flop

987
00:49:14.056 --> 00:49:17.101
and nobody likes them
and I never have another hit cookie again?


988
00:49:17.184 --> 00:49:19.478
Who cares if no one likes your cookies?

989
00:49:20.813 --> 00:49:23.857
Listen, some people
don't like gingerbread.


990
00:49:23.941 --> 00:49:25.526
Some people don't like shortbread.

991
00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:28.028
Some people don't
even like cookies at all.


992
00:49:28.112 --> 00:49:30.614
So you really can't worry
what other people are gonna think.


993
00:49:30.697 --> 00:49:34.493
Sometimes, you just gotta make
the cookies for yourself.


994
00:49:35.244 --> 00:49:37.037
Get to work.

995
00:49:37.621 --> 00:49:38.622
Oh.

996
00:49:45.045 --> 00:49:46.815
You know,
when I said I wanted to see New York,


997
00:49:46.839 --> 00:49:48.590
I didn't mean to see
it all in one day.

998
00:49:48.674 --> 00:49:51.468
So far, we've seen a property
that look like a prison.


999
00:49:51.552 --> 00:49:53.595
One, like a subterranean bunker,

1000
00:49:53.679 --> 00:49:55.159
and there was that hole in the ground

1001
00:49:55.222 --> 00:49:56.825
that I was actually beginning to consider

1002
00:49:56.849 --> 00:49:58.892
until we were attacked by feral pigeons.

1003
00:49:59.226 --> 00:50:02.479
I have to admit so far, Georgia,
this isn't very encouraging.


1004
00:50:02.563 --> 00:50:03.605
No, I know. Okay.

1005
00:50:03.689 --> 00:50:05.941
Just... just wait until you see this one.

1006
00:50:11.738 --> 00:50:13.031
Do you have a key?

1007
00:50:13.115 --> 00:50:14.116
Better.

1008
00:50:14.199 --> 00:50:15.576
I have an app.

1009
00:50:21.582 --> 00:50:22.916
Look at this place.

1010
00:50:23.167 --> 00:50:25.169
The realtor is starting
to stage it for Christmas.


1011
00:50:26.712 --> 00:50:29.298
- Oh, this is...
- Beautiful.


1012
00:50:31.467 --> 00:50:33.260
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

1013
00:50:35.929 --> 00:50:36.930
Look at that.

1014
00:50:37.014 --> 00:50:40.184
That, now, that is a Christmas tree.

1015
00:50:40.726 --> 00:50:41.727
Now, this...

1016
00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:44.646
This is a proper restaurant for our hotel.

1017
00:50:46.899 --> 00:50:51.820
The Viridian is the hotel's
five-star award-winning dining experience.


1018
00:50:51.904 --> 00:50:54.531
I know just the
chef to do it justice.

1019
00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.283
Chef Luke.

1020
00:50:57.326 --> 00:50:58.368
Chef Luke?

1021
00:50:59.786 --> 00:51:01.038
Erm...

1022
00:51:01.997 --> 00:51:03.707
He's great at making pizza.

1023
00:51:04.791 --> 00:51:07.711
I was thinking more along
the lines of Otto Hans Becker.


1024
00:51:08.545 --> 00:51:09.922
Has a Michelin star

1025
00:51:10.005 --> 00:51:12.005
and he's the spoke chef
to World Hunger Foundation.


1026
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:13.926
Chef Luke
likes to help people too.


1027
00:51:15.135 --> 00:51:17.596
Look, Georgia.
I know that he's your friend, but...


1028
00:51:17.679 --> 00:51:21.683
Our new hotel will need
someone with reputation. Gravitas.


1029
00:51:22.601 --> 00:51:26.396
Luke just isn't that.

1030
00:51:40.702 --> 00:51:43.956
So partner, what do you think?

1031
00:51:44.456 --> 00:51:47.209
I think we found our hotel.

1032
00:51:59.346 --> 00:52:00.346
Hey.

1033
00:52:07.688 --> 00:52:08.981
Hi. Excuse me.

1034
00:52:09.064 --> 00:52:10.941
I was wondering if you had matching boots

1035
00:52:11.024 --> 00:52:12.734
to go with this jack... et.

1036
00:52:14.736 --> 00:52:15.736
Hi.

1037
00:52:16.947 --> 00:52:17.947
Hey.

1038
00:52:18.407 --> 00:52:19.449
You work here?

1039
00:52:19.533 --> 00:52:20.951
Actually, I own the place,

1040
00:52:21.702 --> 00:52:24.621
and another uptown and one at the airport.

1041
00:52:25.581 --> 00:52:27.416
Got 'em in the divorce.

1042
00:52:28.208 --> 00:52:30.836
How do you own pet
stores but not a dog?

1043
00:52:30.961 --> 00:52:32.129
I do.

1044
00:52:32.212 --> 00:52:33.505
About 30 of them,

1045
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:35.257
every day, right through that door.

1046
00:52:35.841 --> 00:52:36.842
Hi, Dickens.

1047
00:52:40.512 --> 00:52:42.514
- About yesterday.
- If it's about the money,


1048
00:52:42.598 --> 00:52:44.099
- don't worry about it.
- No.


1049
00:52:45.142 --> 00:52:47.394
I actually have something I wanna ask you.

1050
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:50.731
I would...

1051
00:52:52.774 --> 00:52:56.653
I would really like to go to the
Jingle Mingle at the hotel with you.


1052
00:52:56.737 --> 00:52:59.573
And that is if
you still wanted to go.

1053
00:53:00.949 --> 00:53:04.578
Hmm, do I wanna go
to the Jingle Mingle with you?


1054
00:53:04.661 --> 00:53:06.538
Let me think about it. Yes, I do.

1055
00:53:08.624 --> 00:53:09.875
What changed your mind?

1056
00:53:11.918 --> 00:53:13.462
Nothing. It's just, um,

1057
00:53:14.254 --> 00:53:18.342
I've only been single
for about six months, you know?


1058
00:53:18.425 --> 00:53:23.889
And I still get a little...
skittish with, you know, this.


1059
00:53:25.015 --> 00:53:27.225
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

1060
00:53:27.809 --> 00:53:30.687
I've had about two years,
and I still squirm


1061
00:53:30.771 --> 00:53:32.648
every time someone
asks for my phone number.


1062
00:53:34.274 --> 00:53:35.359
What do you think?

1063
00:53:35.859 --> 00:53:37.277
Should we try them on for size?

1064
00:53:56.463 --> 00:53:58.674
♪ Now, it's that time of year ♪

1065
00:53:58.757 --> 00:54:02.260
♪ When magic's in the air ♪

00:54:02.344 --> 00:54:07.099

♪ It's almost Christmas ♪

1071
00:54:28.453 --> 00:54:30.080
Look what just got here?

1072
00:54:30.163 --> 00:54:33.500
Green, if you're single
and red if you're not ready to mingle.


1073
00:54:34.543 --> 00:54:36.753
I guess you won't be
needing either of those, huh?


1074
00:54:37.379 --> 00:54:38.672
What does that supposed to mean?

1075
00:54:38.755 --> 00:54:40.465
Well, just means why settle for pizza

1076
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:41.800
when you can have filet mignon?

1077
00:54:41.883 --> 00:54:42.884
- Yeah.
- What?


1078
00:54:42.968 --> 00:54:45.095
- Or a brand new hotel.
- What?


1079
00:54:47.597 --> 00:54:50.058
"Welcome to Auberge Moderne,

1080
00:54:50.142 --> 00:54:52.352
Executive Director Georgia Clark."

1081
00:54:52.436 --> 00:54:54.604
Okay. Can you just let me explain it.

1082
00:54:54.688 --> 00:54:57.232
Wait... you're leaving the Hotel Fontaine?

1083
00:54:57.315 --> 00:54:59.401
I wouldn't say leaving exactly.

1084
00:54:59.484 --> 00:55:00.962
But you're going to work at another hotel?

1085
00:55:00.986 --> 00:55:02.738
Well, sort of, but...

1086
00:55:02.821 --> 00:55:07.075
Actually, she's gonna
be working for her own hotel.


1087
00:55:07.826 --> 00:55:10.245
Can we please just do this later?

1088
00:55:10.328 --> 00:55:12.414
Georgia is going to be a part owner

1089
00:55:12.497 --> 00:55:14.583
of our new Auberge Moderne.

1090
00:55:15.167 --> 00:55:17.169
Oh, let me guess. 
This was your idea?

1091
00:55:17.252 --> 00:55:18.712
No. Luke.

1092
00:55:19.296 --> 00:55:20.338
It was mine.

1093
00:55:21.506 --> 00:55:23.842
Look, I'm sorry to surprise
everybody like this.


1094
00:55:23.925 --> 00:55:27.721
It's just... I've always
really wanted to own something,


1095
00:55:27.804 --> 00:55:30.140
you know, and the...
And the chance came up and...


1096
00:55:31.975 --> 00:55:33.018
anyway,

1097
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:37.147
I hope you guys all really understand.

1098
00:55:37.981 --> 00:55:41.985
Yes, I am leaving the hotel.

1099
00:55:42.819 --> 00:55:44.863
But not tonight.

1100
00:55:44.946 --> 00:55:46.823
And we'll always have the Jingle Mingle.

1101
00:55:46.907 --> 00:55:49.993
Yeah. We can just make it
into a going away party.


1102
00:55:51.912 --> 00:55:54.206
Congratulations, Georgia. Really.

1103
00:55:54.289 --> 00:55:56.666
It's a great opportunity.

1104
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:59.628
Yeah. Besides, you, you, you shouldn't
stay in one place all your life.


1105
00:55:59.711 --> 00:56:01.254
I mean, look at me.

1106
00:56:01.338 --> 00:56:02.964
Oh, just stop it, Milton.

1107
00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.550
I think it's wonderful, Georgia.

1108
00:56:05.634 --> 00:56:07.010
Congratulations.

1109
00:56:07.093 --> 00:56:08.261
Thank you.

1110
00:56:09.888 --> 00:56:10.889
Luke.

1111
00:56:12.516 --> 00:56:14.518
I'm really sorry I didn't tell you.

1112
00:56:14.601 --> 00:56:16.037
I just didn't think it was gonna happen.

1113
00:56:16.061 --> 00:56:17.479
No. Don't worry about it.

1114
00:56:18.396 --> 00:56:20.356
Maybe you'll need a chef
for the new place, right?


1115
00:56:21.399 --> 00:56:23.944
Yeah. Yeah. Who knows.

1116
00:56:25.111 --> 00:56:27.531
Got it. Right hotel, wrong chef.

1117
00:56:29.199 --> 00:56:31.743
Well, I, uh, should head
back up to the kitchen.


1118
00:56:31.827 --> 00:56:34.246
Got a lot to prep for tonight.
You're gonna be there, right?


1119
00:56:34.329 --> 00:56:35.956
Yeah.

1120
00:56:36.039 --> 00:56:38.959
Um, singles only.

1121
00:56:41.127 --> 00:56:42.462
Congrats, G.

1122
00:56:52.973 --> 00:56:54.057
Kiki.

1123
00:56:55.475 --> 00:56:58.603
Kiki. I'm sorry.
I wanted to tell you.


1124
00:56:58.687 --> 00:57:00.289
- I just didn't know how I...
- Don't worry about it.


1125
00:57:00.313 --> 00:57:03.066
It's not like we're
best friends or anything.


1126
00:57:03.149 --> 00:57:04.985
Don't say that.

1127
00:57:05.652 --> 00:57:06.653
I've got to go.

1128
00:57:06.736 --> 00:57:09.322
I still have to find eleven pipers
and twelve drummers


1129
00:57:09.406 --> 00:57:11.825
and the party is
less than six hours away.

1130
00:57:13.994 --> 00:57:17.205
I have to admit, though,
you finally convinced me.


1131
00:57:17.289 --> 00:57:18.290
About what?

1132
00:57:18.373 --> 00:57:20.959
Doesn't matter how much
glitter you throw around.


1133
00:57:23.003 --> 00:57:25.088
There really is no such thing as magic.

1134
00:57:41.897 --> 00:57:43.875
Well, the guests should
be arriving in a couple of hours.


1135
00:57:43.899 --> 00:57:45.275
Flo, anything I can help you with?

1136
00:57:45.358 --> 00:57:47.319
Oh. Actually, there is.

1137
00:57:47.402 --> 00:57:48.612
Have a seat, Milton.

1138
00:57:49.279 --> 00:57:50.739
Oh, all righty...

1139
00:57:50.822 --> 00:57:53.366
So, with it being Christmas Eve and all,

1140
00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:56.578
and you and I being
friends all these years.


1141
00:57:56.661 --> 00:57:59.331
I thought, well... I... uh-hmm.

1142
00:58:00.540 --> 00:58:02.375
- For me?
- Yeah. Well, read the tag.


1143
00:58:02.459 --> 00:58:03.877
Oh.

1144
00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:06.379
Yeah, that's me.

1145
00:58:06.463 --> 00:58:07.964
Okay. Go ahead.
Open it already.


1146
00:58:08.048 --> 00:58:09.299
Okay. Sure. Sure.

1147
00:58:09.382 --> 00:58:12.218
Well, this is...
Oh, it's sweet of you.


1148
00:58:15.347 --> 00:58:17.807
Oh, Flo.

1149
00:58:17.891 --> 00:58:19.827
Well, you know, you looked
really good in the red one,


1150
00:58:19.851 --> 00:58:22.646
but I just thought that
this went with your eyes better.


1151
00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.814
Hmm.

1152
00:58:24.898 --> 00:58:26.733
Ah. Great.

1153
00:58:26.816 --> 00:58:28.151
Thank you.

1154
00:58:28.234 --> 00:58:29.945
But I didn't get you anything.

1155
00:58:30.028 --> 00:58:32.113
Oh, well, I've already
thought about that.


1156
00:58:33.114 --> 00:58:35.408
Remember I told you that
my son and my daughter-in-law


1157
00:58:35.492 --> 00:58:37.285
can't make it this Christmas?

1158
00:58:37.369 --> 00:58:41.539
So, I was wondering
if you would like to come to my place


1159
00:58:41.623 --> 00:58:44.626
and help me eat
all that goldarn turkey that I bought.


1160
00:58:46.044 --> 00:58:49.047
Flo, I would like that very much.

1161
00:58:51.633 --> 00:58:53.635
Great.

1162
00:58:54.761 --> 00:58:56.429
I need to get
back for the mingle, soon.

1163
00:58:56.513 --> 00:58:59.391
But I really want to show you
my idea for the lobby first.


1164
00:58:59.474 --> 00:59:03.895
So I'm thinking we redo this
whole reception area here.


1165
00:59:03.979 --> 00:59:05.021
Oh, shoot.

1166
00:59:05.105 --> 00:59:06.898
Madame Fontaine,
I forgot to charge my phone


1167
00:59:06.982 --> 00:59:09.734
so I might lose you,
but what do you think?


1168
00:59:09.818 --> 00:59:11.611
Whatever you like, Georgia.

1169
00:59:11.695 --> 00:59:14.614
Okay. Great.

1170
00:59:14.698 --> 00:59:16.449
Are you sure you don't wanna ask Jean
-Luc?

1171
00:59:16.533 --> 00:59:17.701
Jean
-Luc is not here.

1172
00:59:17.784 --> 00:59:22.330
He's found a more amusing way to vacation.

1173
00:59:28.586 --> 00:59:31.006
There's got to be charger
in here somewhere.


1174
00:59:33.216 --> 00:59:34.551
Of course.

1175
00:59:34.634 --> 00:59:36.094
Oh, the party.

1176
00:59:44.894 --> 00:59:48.064
What? Oh, the app.

1177
00:59:50.191 --> 00:59:53.028
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no.


1178
00:59:56.197 --> 00:59:57.198
Hello?

1179
00:59:57.282 --> 00:59:59.743
Can anybody hear me? Hello?

1180
01:00:01.411 --> 01:00:02.620
Help!

1181
01:00:02.704 --> 01:00:03.705
Hello?

1182
01:00:21.389 --> 01:00:23.016
Has anyone seen Georgia?

1183
01:00:23.099 --> 01:00:25.060
I've been calling her
for like the last hour


1184
01:00:25.143 --> 01:00:26.978
and it just keeps going to voicemail.

1185
01:00:28.146 --> 01:00:29.647
What about the milkmaids?

1186
01:00:30.857 --> 01:00:32.901
Them too?

1187
01:00:32.984 --> 01:00:35.445
Great. That is just great.

1188
01:00:35.528 --> 01:00:39.074
If it isn't Little Miss Edwina Scrooge.

1189
01:00:39.157 --> 01:00:41.701
You know what?
Not tonight, Santa, okay?


1190
01:00:41.785 --> 01:00:44.829
I've got no pipers, my drummers cancelled,

1191
01:00:44.913 --> 01:00:47.749
and my lords 'a' leaping
are stuck on the train from Brooklyn,


1192
01:00:47.832 --> 01:00:49.602
along with the rest
of the 12 Days of Christmas.


1193
01:00:49.626 --> 01:00:50.627
I don't even have a...

1194
01:00:52.629 --> 01:00:54.255
Hey, Santa.

1195
01:00:58.009 --> 01:00:59.803
How'd you like to go to a party?

1196
01:01:00.303 --> 01:01:01.930
Thought you'd never ask.

1197
01:01:13.191 --> 01:01:14.818
Well, Merry Christmas.

1198
01:01:14.901 --> 01:01:18.571
Are we, uh, single
or not yet ready to mingle?


1199
01:01:19.364 --> 01:01:21.658
Um, single I guess.

1200
01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:23.910
Single, it is. Enjoy.

1201
01:01:23.993 --> 01:01:26.079
Thank you.

1202
01:01:26.162 --> 01:01:29.415
Stop fidgeting.
You look just fine.


1203
01:01:29.499 --> 01:01:33.294
Now, this is a nice,
normal party full of nice, normal people.


1204
01:01:33.378 --> 01:01:36.214
Thank you.

1205
01:01:36.297 --> 01:01:41.136
This is going to be
just the inspiration you need.


1206
01:01:45.723 --> 01:01:47.225
Something's wrong. I know it.

1207
01:01:47.308 --> 01:01:48.726
This isn't like her.

1208
01:01:48.810 --> 01:01:50.728
Perhaps, she changed
her mind about coming.


1209
01:01:50.812 --> 01:01:51.938
Georgia wouldn't do that.

1210
01:01:52.021 --> 01:01:53.582
This party was her
idea in the first place.


1211
01:01:53.606 --> 01:01:54.983
She loves the Jingle Mingle.

1212
01:01:55.066 --> 01:01:58.027
Well, maybe she doesn't love it anymore.

1213
01:02:03.158 --> 01:02:05.201
Listen, I think I know where Georgia is.

1214
01:02:05.285 --> 01:02:07.704
Help.

1215
01:02:07.787 --> 01:02:09.080
Please, help me.

1216
01:02:09.164 --> 01:02:10.915
Hello? Hi. Hi.

1217
01:02:13.501 --> 01:02:15.587
Help, please. Help me get out, please.

1218
01:02:33.813 --> 01:02:35.064
I own a frozen yogurt store

1219
01:02:35.148 --> 01:02:36.983
and our signature flavor is vanilla.

1220
01:02:37.066 --> 01:02:40.087
In my free time, I collect vintage khakis,
you know, from different eras in history.


1221
01:02:40.111 --> 01:02:42.989
Some people believe
that khaki originated in 1930s,


1222
01:02:43.072 --> 01:02:46.534
but you can actually trace
the origin of the pants to the 1840s.


1223
01:02:48.578 --> 01:02:50.163
Excuse me.

1224
01:02:59.172 --> 01:03:02.258
If this is normal, I quit.

1225
01:03:25.323 --> 01:03:26.741
Look, I'm sorry.

1226
01:03:26.824 --> 01:03:29.327
I'm just not ready to do this yet.

1227
01:03:30.078 --> 01:03:31.078
Sorry, sir?

1228
01:03:31.788 --> 01:03:34.123
Oh, just talking to the dog.

1229
01:03:34.207 --> 01:03:35.917
Oh.

1230
01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.877
Well, that's everything then.

1231
01:03:37.961 --> 01:03:40.713
You're not joining everyone
for the Jingle Mingle tonight?


1232
01:03:40.797 --> 01:03:41.881
No, I'm not.

1233
01:03:41.965 --> 01:03:44.759
Besides, what's so great
about mingling, anyway?


1234
01:03:46.678 --> 01:03:49.305
Dickens! Dickens!

1235
01:03:54.811 --> 01:03:56.354
Dickens!

1236
01:03:56.437 --> 01:03:58.189
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1237
01:04:12.996 --> 01:04:14.497
"Good girll pose," Amazing.

1238
01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.260
Perfect. Those are some
real Santa selfies.


1239
01:04:16.291 --> 01:04:18.227
You know where to find me
afterwards if it gets too cold.


1240
01:04:18.251 --> 01:04:21.004
Oh, speaking of...
Thank you. Thank you.


1241
01:04:21.671 --> 01:04:23.673
Santas are supposed to be
having milk and cookies.


1242
01:04:23.756 --> 01:04:25.591
Yeah, but this Santa wants champagne

1243
01:04:25.675 --> 01:04:27.444
because I've been working
incredibly hard for this.


1244
01:04:27.468 --> 01:04:29.108
- I'm not dropping it.
- Drop it! Drop it!


1245
01:04:36.144 --> 01:04:37.854
Dickens.

1246
01:04:41.941 --> 01:04:44.027
Just look at what you did, Santa.

1247
01:04:45.987 --> 01:04:47.488
Santa!

1248
01:04:49.949 --> 01:04:51.200
Dickens!

1249
01:04:54.537 --> 01:04:55.538
Hi.

1250
01:04:56.998 --> 01:04:58.291
Going somewhere?

1251
01:04:59.959 --> 01:05:00.960
Um...

1252
01:05:04.047 --> 01:05:06.507
I'll, uh, I'll go check the fuses,
you keep them calm.


1253
01:05:06.591 --> 01:05:08.301
What? What?!

1254
01:05:09.677 --> 01:05:12.096
Hey, everyone.

1255
01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.098
Wow.

1256
01:05:14.182 --> 01:05:18.728
What a Christmas surprise!
I should ask Santa for new wiring!


1257
01:05:31.741 --> 01:05:34.243
No, I thought
that was the whole point of our tree?


1258
01:05:34.327 --> 01:05:36.120
People bring their own ornaments.

1259
01:05:36.204 --> 01:05:39.415
Makes it feel more like home.
Look at that.


1260
01:05:39.499 --> 01:05:41.167
Not bad for a seven-year-old.

1261
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:44.921
Hey, making lunch for you
is the highlight of my day.


1262
01:05:45.004 --> 01:05:47.590
It doesn't matter
how much glitter you throw around.


1263
01:05:47.673 --> 01:05:49.842
There really is no such thing as magic.

1264
01:06:19.163 --> 01:06:21.332
Oh, my God. Yes.

1265
01:06:21.416 --> 01:06:23.626
Hi. Hi. Yes.
Thank you. Thank you.


1266
01:06:23.709 --> 01:06:26.712
Hi. Oh, my God.
Um, uh, can you get the app?


1267
01:06:28.881 --> 01:06:32.009
You need to get an app
for the building to open the door.


1268
01:06:37.557 --> 01:06:38.558
There's that.

1269
01:06:42.019 --> 01:06:45.481
All right, everyone.
Lights will be back on in just a minute.


1270
01:06:46.482 --> 01:06:48.776
Have some more champagne, right?

1271
01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:51.195
Luke. Everybody's leaving.

1272
01:06:51.279 --> 01:06:53.199
Can you get them to play
some music or something?


1273
01:06:53.281 --> 01:06:55.408
With what? The power is still out.

1274
01:06:55.491 --> 01:06:57.577
My party-giving reputation
is going to be over


1275
01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:58.953
before it even started.

1276
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:09.130
I'm sorry.

1277
01:07:09.213 --> 01:07:11.883
I really thought I could do this, but...

1278
01:07:11.966 --> 01:07:14.594
Hey. Breakups are hard.

1279
01:07:14.677 --> 01:07:16.429
You know?

1280
01:07:16.512 --> 01:07:18.232
But you can't let it
define your whole life.


1281
01:07:19.223 --> 01:07:21.225
So how do you get past it?

1282
01:07:21.809 --> 01:07:23.060
Maybe you don't.

1283
01:07:24.187 --> 01:07:27.273
Maybe you just go through it.

1284
01:07:27.815 --> 01:07:29.901
Sounds easier than it feels.

1285
01:07:30.735 --> 01:07:34.822
Well, there's no rule that says
you have to do it alone.


1286
01:07:51.172 --> 01:07:54.467
How long do you think it's gonna
take to get the power back on?


1287
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:57.428
Beats me.
Some things just take time, you know?


1288
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:04.810
Victor, I thought
you didn't want anyone to know?


1289
01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:07.855
I thought you didn't want anyone to know.

1290
01:08:11.234 --> 01:08:12.276
Come here.

1291
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:14.319
Victor, people are looking.

1292
01:08:14.403 --> 01:08:17.323
Good, because I want them to see this.

1293
01:08:17.406 --> 01:08:19.200
Anna...

1294
01:08:19.283 --> 01:08:22.118
I know this is only
our first Christmas together,


1295
01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:25.413
but I know I wanna spend
all the rest of mine with you.


1296
01:08:31.754 --> 01:08:33.047
Oh, he's doing it.

1297
01:08:33.130 --> 01:08:34.715
Will you marry me?

1298
01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.594
Yes. Yes.

1299
01:08:45.518 --> 01:08:46.644

1323
01:10:18.569 --> 01:10:20.196
I almost didn't make it.

1324
01:10:20.279 --> 01:10:23.282
It's a long story, but I don't know.

1325
01:10:23.366 --> 01:10:26.202
Maybe modern
isn't all it's cracked up to be.


1326
01:10:27.036 --> 01:10:28.954
All I wanted was to get back here.

1327
01:10:30.122 --> 01:10:32.917
Seriously? Look at this place,
the lights don't work.


1328
01:10:33.918 --> 01:10:35.419
The candles have mystery.

1329
01:10:35.503 --> 01:10:37.213
Then we need to change that ancient rug.

1330
01:10:37.296 --> 01:10:40.007
Ancient? I think you mean vintage.

1331
01:10:40.091 --> 01:10:42.176
There are cracks in the wall.

1332
01:10:42.259 --> 01:10:43.678
Cracks add the magic in.

1333
01:10:43.761 --> 01:10:45.888
I thought you didn't believe in magic.

1334
01:10:45.971 --> 01:10:47.264
Maybe it's time to start.

Thank you.

1344
01:11:30.015 --> 01:11:33.728
I wrote it a long time ago
and I never thought anybody wanna hear it.


1345
01:11:33.811 --> 01:11:36.856
Oh, I love everything you do, Pandora.

1346
01:11:37.857 --> 01:11:38.858
How'd you know?

1347
01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:41.152
I'd recognize your voice anywhere.

1348
01:11:41.986 --> 01:11:43.571
You're very big in my country.

1349
01:11:43.946 --> 01:11:45.740
In fact, it was your song,

1350
01:11:45.823 --> 01:11:47.992
"Hey, You Get Off My Throne"

1351
01:11:48.075 --> 01:11:51.120
that gave me the courage to drop
my title and to go my own way.


1352
01:11:51.912 --> 01:11:52.913
Wow.

1353
01:11:54.331 --> 01:11:56.125
Single version or the dance mix?

1354
01:11:57.334 --> 01:11:58.627
Dance mix.

1355
01:12:00.921 --> 01:12:04.341
Um, excuse me, everyone.

1356
01:12:04.425 --> 01:12:06.510
Merry Christmas.

1357
01:12:06.594 --> 01:12:08.345
I'm sorry that I'm late.

1358
01:12:08.429 --> 01:12:10.181
And I'm sorry about the electricity.

1359
01:12:10.264 --> 01:12:12.558
This is a really, really old building.

1360
01:12:12.641 --> 01:12:13.785
- But, we love it.
- We love it.


1361
01:12:13.809 --> 01:12:16.312
Yes. Yes, I do, too. I just...

1362
01:12:16.395 --> 01:12:20.983
I didn't realize exactly
how much until tonight.


1363
01:12:22.902 --> 01:12:25.654
I guess I'd forgotten
that there's magic in this place.


1364
01:12:26.447 --> 01:12:28.115
You just have to believe in it.

1365
01:12:29.617 --> 01:12:31.285
Raymond,

1366
01:12:31.368 --> 01:12:34.955
I don't wanna own
the Auberge Moderne, I'm sorry.


1367
01:12:35.039 --> 01:12:37.625
I truly thought that I did,

1368
01:12:37.708 --> 01:12:43.672
but it turns out owning
isn't as important as belonging.


1369
01:12:46.509 --> 01:12:48.260
I think I belong here.

1370
01:12:52.848 --> 01:12:56.644
My Christmas wish to all of you is
that you find the place where you belong,


1371
01:12:56.727 --> 01:13:00.105
whether it's family, or friends...

1372
01:13:01.816 --> 01:13:03.150
or an old building.

1373
01:13:03.943 --> 01:13:05.194
Merry Christmas.

1374
01:13:05.277 --> 01:13:08.656
Merry Christmas.

1375
01:13:08.739 --> 01:13:12.076
And a very Happy New Year.

1376
01:13:12.159 --> 01:13:15.496
Thank you. Thank you.

1377
01:13:22.753 --> 01:13:24.630
I thought
these would make you laugh.


1378
01:13:24.713 --> 01:13:26.215
Sweatpants...

1379
01:13:29.426 --> 01:13:31.345
They're perfect. Thank you.

1380
01:13:31.428 --> 01:13:33.889
No, thank you for everything.

1381
01:13:33.973 --> 01:13:36.642
I'm truly sorry
everything didn't work out.


1382
01:13:36.725 --> 01:13:39.687
Oh, but it did.

1383
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:43.858
Turns out my last release
was a huge hit in Caspernia, who knew?


1384
01:13:43.941 --> 01:13:46.527
The Prince, I mean, Ray
-Ray,

1385
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:49.321
is putting together a big tour
for me over there.


1386
01:13:49.405 --> 01:13:53.158
And the plane leaves
in two hours, so, Merry Christmas.


1387
01:13:53.242 --> 01:13:54.326
Merry Christmas.

1388
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:55.953
Merry Christmas!

1389
01:13:56.036 --> 01:13:57.413
Bye.

1390
01:13:58.706 --> 01:14:00.833
Oh, I'll catch up.

1391
01:14:02.376 --> 01:14:04.545
Job's perfect.
And then I got all of these.


1392
01:14:04.628 --> 01:14:05.963
This ended up being fine.

1393
01:14:06.046 --> 01:14:07.882
- This is...
- Kiki.


1394
01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:09.466
Hi.

1395
01:14:10.926 --> 01:14:12.011
It's me.

1396
01:14:13.178 --> 01:14:14.388
Pam?

1397
01:14:14.471 --> 01:14:17.600
Actually, I'm Pandora.

1398
01:14:17.683 --> 01:14:19.226
Wow!

1399
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:21.145
This is amazing.

1400
01:14:21.228 --> 01:14:23.856
I'm sorry
that I couldn't tell you the truth.


1401
01:14:23.939 --> 01:14:27.985
But well, I just
wanted to say thank you

1402
01:14:28.068 --> 01:14:30.404
for showing me Christmas.

1403
01:14:30.487 --> 01:14:34.658
Honestly, you're the closest thing
to a best friend I've ever had.


1404
01:14:34.742 --> 01:14:37.953
Merry Christmas, Pam... Pandora.

1405
01:14:38.037 --> 01:14:40.497
Merry Christmas, Kiki.

1406
01:14:46.420 --> 01:14:49.048
Wow. So she was Pandora all along.

1407
01:14:49.131 --> 01:14:50.966
How about that Pandora?

1408
01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:52.718
Gosh.

1409
01:14:53.636 --> 01:14:55.471
Yeah. Who's, uh, Pandora?

1410
01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:08.400
Madame Fontaine,
what are you doing here?


1411
01:15:08.484 --> 01:15:11.320
When we were cut off
from talking yesterday,


1412
01:15:11.403 --> 01:15:13.197
I realized something.

1413
01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.992
There, I was on a yacht
alone at Christmas and why?


1414
01:15:17.076 --> 01:15:21.205
So, I decided to get on the first flight
and tell you something in person.


1415
01:15:21.288 --> 01:15:23.391
Actually, um, I have something
I have to tell you, too.


1416
01:15:23.415 --> 01:15:26.210
- The deal is off.
- The deal is off. What?


1417
01:15:26.293 --> 01:15:28.379
I don't want another hotel.

1418
01:15:28.462 --> 01:15:31.215
I want this hotel with you in it.

1419
01:15:31.298 --> 01:15:35.803
I want you to be the Executive Director
of the Hotel Fontaine.


1420
01:15:35.886 --> 01:15:38.055
There will be a salary
increase, of course,


1421
01:15:38.138 --> 01:15:41.100
as well as another little incentive.

1422
01:15:41.183 --> 01:15:42.851
Would you accept

1423
01:15:42.935 --> 01:15:47.356
49% ownership of the Hotel Fontaine?

1424
01:15:47.439 --> 01:15:49.775
- What?
- I just think that


1425
01:15:49.858 --> 01:15:53.112
everybody deserves something
extra at Christmas.


1426
01:15:56.281 --> 01:15:57.908
I'll let you decide.

1427
01:15:59.576 --> 01:16:01.286
Are you at the hotel?

1428
01:16:02.413 --> 01:16:04.206
Let me show you to the bar.

1429
01:16:07.751 --> 01:16:09.586
Um, did you just hear that?

1430
01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:13.382
Uh-huh. I guess I'll be coming to you
about a raise after the holidays.


1431
01:16:13.465 --> 01:16:15.300
I have a better idea.

1432
01:16:15.384 --> 01:16:16.927
How would you like the events

1433
01:16:17.011 --> 01:16:18.971
and marketing position
at the Hotel Fontaine?


1434
01:16:19.054 --> 01:16:21.807
There is no events and marketing position.

1435
01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:23.559
There is now.

1436
01:16:23.642 --> 01:16:25.477
That is, if you'll forgive me.

1437
01:16:25.561 --> 01:16:29.231
Oh, my gosh.
Of course I forgive you.


1438
01:16:29.314 --> 01:16:31.025
What are best friends for?

1439
01:16:31.108 --> 01:16:33.736
But do you think you could
keep an eye on the concierge


1440
01:16:33.819 --> 01:16:35.005
desk for me for just a minute?

1441
01:16:35.029 --> 01:16:37.114
I do have to drop these
swans off before noon.


1442
01:16:37.197 --> 01:16:38.490
Hand it over.

1443
01:16:38.574 --> 01:16:40.242
Thank you.

1444
01:16:44.455 --> 01:16:46.874
Oh, Georgia, I, uh, forgot
to give you this back.


1445
01:16:47.541 --> 01:16:50.419
Actually, Milton, why don't you keep it?

1446
01:16:50.502 --> 01:16:52.337
No, no, no, I, I couldn't.
I'm not the, uh...


1447
01:16:52.421 --> 01:16:55.049
Sure you can.
It goes with your new job.


1448
01:16:55.132 --> 01:16:57.885
What? Really?

1449
01:16:58.927 --> 01:17:00.220
Merry Christmas, Milton.

1450
01:17:00.304 --> 01:17:01.847
Thank you.

1451
01:17:01.930 --> 01:17:03.682
Merry Christmas.

1452
01:17:04.433 --> 01:17:05.642
Wow.

1453
01:17:08.437 --> 01:17:10.647
- So, Manager, huh?
- Yeah.


1454
01:17:10.731 --> 01:17:12.524
Oh.

1455
01:17:12.608 --> 01:17:14.252
- Here. Can I help you with that?
- Oh, please.


1456
01:17:14.276 --> 01:17:15.736
- Yeah.
- Yeah. All right.


1457
01:17:15.819 --> 01:17:18.989
Well, I guess I'll need to get a new
blazer to go with my green scarf.


1458
01:17:19.073 --> 01:17:20.657
Oh.

1459
01:17:20.741 --> 01:17:24.536
So, Milton, I have a confession to make.

1460
01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:26.121
You do?

1461
01:17:26.205 --> 01:17:28.999
Yeah. You know the bar sink
that you always start with sabotaged.


1462
01:17:29.083 --> 01:17:31.543
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1463
01:17:31.627 --> 01:17:33.295
It was.

1464
01:17:33.378 --> 01:17:34.546
It was?

1465
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:35.631
It was.

1466
01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.468
Merry Christmas, Flo.

1467
01:17:39.551 --> 01:17:40.803
Merry Christmas.

1468
01:17:41.887 --> 01:17:42.930
- It was?
- Yeah.


1469
01:17:45.933 --> 01:17:49.269
So, when do you think
you'll be back in New York?


1470
01:17:49.353 --> 01:17:51.730
Oh, probably tomorrow.

1471
01:17:51.814 --> 01:17:52.856
What?

1472
01:17:52.940 --> 01:17:54.691
Yeah. This is a staycation.

1473
01:17:54.775 --> 01:17:56.110
I live in New Jersey.

1474
01:18:00.572 --> 01:18:02.533

1475
01:18:02.616 --> 01:18:04.576
Don't you take Christmas Day off?

1476
01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:06.370
Well, that depends.

1477
01:18:06.453 --> 01:18:08.455
