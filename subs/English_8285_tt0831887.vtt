1
00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:21.717
I am Death, Denny Colt.

2
00:01:21.923 --> 00:01:26.855
You are the only man who has
ever escaped my cold embrace.


3
00:01:27.356 --> 00:01:30.220
But I am never far away.

4
00:01:32.656 --> 00:01:34.815
Yes.

5
00:01:35.023 --> 00:01:37.648
I'm always with you.

6
00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.518
-Yeah.
-Something big is breaking down...


7
00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:20.086
...by the mudflats, Spirit.

8
00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:21.915
By the wreck of an old cargo ship.

9
00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:24.620
Word on the street
is The Octopus might be in on it.


10
00:02:24.823 --> 00:02:25.811
I'd call it in...

11
00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:29.621
...but who knows
how far his tentacles spread?


12
00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:31.254
Who we can trust?

13
00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:33.717
I'm on my way.

14
00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.851
My city. She's always there for me.

15
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.754
Every lonely night, she's there for me.

16
00:03:56.089 --> 00:04:00.522
She's not some tarted-up fraud
all dressed up like a piece of jailbait.


17
00:04:01.122 --> 00:04:02.748
No. She's an old city...

18
00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:06.683
...old and proud of her every pock
and crack and wrinkle.


19
00:04:07.222 --> 00:04:10.814
She's my sweetheart, my plaything.

20
00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:15.054
She doesn't hide what she is,
what she's made of;.


21
00:04:15.256 --> 00:04:18.983
Sweat, muscle
and blood of generations.


22
00:04:27.322 --> 00:04:28.413
She sleeps.

23
00:04:28.623 --> 00:04:32.077
After midnight and until dawn,
only shadows move in the silence.


24
00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.084
There she is!.

25
00:04:34.422 --> 00:04:36.354
-Get her.
-Damn, I've got no time for this.


26
00:04:37.322 --> 00:04:40.117
My city screams. She needs me.

27
00:04:43.523 --> 00:04:46.785
She is my love. 
She is my life.

28
00:04:46.989 --> 00:04:48.888
And I am her Spirit.

29
00:05:15.422 --> 00:05:17.910
Don't worry, you're safe now.
Try to catch your breath.


30
00:05:18.122 --> 00:05:20.588
-Here, let's get you to your feet.
-Police!.


31
00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.084
Over here, MacReady.

32
00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.948
This is a good man, you can trust him.
Tell him everything.


33
00:05:25.155 --> 00:05:27.587
-I will.
-Call your shrink if you got one.


34
00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:39.853
What are you?

35
00:05:57.989 --> 00:05:59.455
That's The Spirit.

36
00:05:59.656 --> 00:06:01.315
God bless him.

37
00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:08.944
She provides for me, my city does.

38
00:06:11.055 --> 00:06:14.953
She gives me everything I need.

39
00:06:19.322 --> 00:06:21.379
Move it over, Liebowitz. I'm driving.

40
00:07:14.989 --> 00:07:16.649
Sussman called.

41
00:07:16.855 --> 00:07:18.878
Something's going down here.
Could be big.


42
00:07:19.089 --> 00:07:21.055
-How big?
-Octopus big.


43
00:07:21.256 --> 00:07:23.552
-Jesus!. We better call for backup.
-Not just yet.


44
00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:26.483
Sussman wants this one
kept under the radar for now.


45
00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:29.587
Yes. Come closer. 
Come home to me.

46
00:07:29.788 --> 00:07:31.687
You hear that, boss?

47
00:07:31.989 --> 00:07:33.455
Every goddamn night.

48
00:07:34.022 --> 00:07:38.886
Lorelei. The angel of death.
She's never far away. Not from me.


49
00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:41.987
They say only sailors and cops
can hear her.


50
00:07:42.889 --> 00:07:44.946
Well, I'm not a sailor.

51
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:48.417
And I'm not a cop.

52
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:58.814
-Officer down.
-Roger that, I copy.


53
00:07:59.022 --> 00:08:00.454
Get an ambulance. Call Dolan.

54
00:08:00.656 --> 00:08:02.554
-Commissioner--
-Not Commissioner Dolan.


55
00:08:02.755 --> 00:08:04.187
-Dr. Dolan.
-Still breathing.


56
00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:07.219
-Spirit says he's still breathing.
-Keep me advised.


57
00:08:07.422 --> 00:08:08.853
Hurts like a son of a bitch.

58
00:08:09.189 --> 00:08:10.678
Take it easy. We'll get you home.

59
00:08:12.289 --> 00:08:13.914
That broad.

60
00:08:14.122 --> 00:08:16.815
-You should have seen her.
-Broad?


61
00:08:17.022 --> 00:08:18.851
A beautiful broad.

62
00:08:19.055 --> 00:08:20.316
She was beautiful.

63
00:08:20.523 --> 00:08:22.818
Keep him talking. 
Keep him awake.

64
00:08:23.022 --> 00:08:25.284
You look for more footprints,
Liebowitz.


65
00:08:25.489 --> 00:08:28.512
Yeah. She was beautiful.

66
00:10:12.788 --> 00:10:14.981
If this is the wrong box,
I'll kill you myself.


67
00:10:15.189 --> 00:10:17.485
Just get us out of here.
It's The Octopus.


68
00:10:18.155 --> 00:10:19.382
You know what he can do.

69
00:10:19.588 --> 00:10:21.986
Shut up and bleed.

70
00:10:29.955 --> 00:10:31.978
You look for more footprints,
Liebowitz.


71
00:10:34.655 --> 00:10:36.281
She was beautiful.

72
00:10:36.489 --> 00:10:39.250
And she wasn't looking
for a fight, either.


73
00:10:40.788 --> 00:10:41.776
Easy, now.

74
00:10:41.989 --> 00:10:43.955
Just breathe through your nose
if you can.


75
00:10:46.555 --> 00:10:47.714
Getting dizzy.

76
00:10:47.922 --> 00:10:50.615
Steady. Steady.

77
00:10:54.989 --> 00:10:56.046
Heads up!.

78
00:11:03.555 --> 00:11:05.146
Take it home, boys.

79
00:11:05.356 --> 00:11:09.754
When me and The Spirit get together,
we like to party all night.


80
00:11:23.489 --> 00:11:29.648
There is nothing I like better
than kicking your ass all night long.


81
00:11:31.588 --> 00:11:33.179
Except maybe eggs.

82
00:11:37.022 --> 00:11:38.010
Where's the truck?

83
00:11:38.222 --> 00:11:39.881
Silken Floss is the most
beautiful woman.


84
00:11:40.089 --> 00:11:41.884
How do we find our way home
without her?


85
00:11:42.089 --> 00:11:44.146
Silken Floss is the most beautiful
woman ever.


86
00:11:44.356 --> 00:11:45.616
She was supposed to be here.

87
00:11:45.822 --> 00:11:47.617
How do we find our way home
without her?


88
00:11:47.822 --> 00:11:49.448
Where's the truck?

89
00:11:49.655 --> 00:11:51.087
I found the truck!

90
00:11:51.289 --> 00:11:54.914
Silken Floss
is the most beautiful woman ever.


91
00:11:59.456 --> 00:12:01.683
Load up the box and pile in,
specimens.


92
00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:04.480
You've done your
petri dishes proud.


93
00:12:06.655 --> 00:12:10.179
No need to wait for the boss
if that's The Spirit back there.


94
00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:14.518
The Octopus always finds his nemesis
so distracting.


95
00:12:14.722 --> 00:12:17.552
It is The Spirit. He had his hat on.
We was watching.


96
00:12:18.022 --> 00:12:19.954
Well, then, they'll be at it all night.

97
00:12:20.155 --> 00:12:23.212
-Yeah, boss said so.
-Boss said so. We was watching.


98
00:12:23.422 --> 00:12:26.854
Oh, God. Yeah. I heard.

99
00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:32.545
Silken Floss is the most beautiful--

100
00:12:55.622 --> 00:12:57.451
You're giving me a headache,
Octopus.


101
00:12:59.722 --> 00:13:02.211
It's gonna get worse
before it gets better, pretty boy.


102
00:13:02.421 --> 00:13:03.887
You're right about that.

103
00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:27.018
Come on!

104
00:14:27.355 --> 00:14:29.322
Toilets are always funny.

105
00:14:50.421 --> 00:14:51.614
I was watching.

106
00:15:02.755 --> 00:15:05.721
That's enough.
Let's get out of here.


107
00:15:07.122 --> 00:15:09.054
Pretty boy.

108
00:15:10.089 --> 00:15:12.214
Tough boy.

109
00:15:13.055 --> 00:15:15.748
I'll be seeing you again...

110
00:15:15.955 --> 00:15:16.978
...real soon.

111
00:15:17.421 --> 00:15:19.546
I'm gonna be the death of you,
Octopus.


112
00:15:20.955 --> 00:15:22.046
Death?

113
00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:24.778
Not for me, brother. 
Death, he says.

114
00:15:24.989 --> 00:15:27.148
I'm gonna kill you all kinds of dead.

115
00:15:27.355 --> 00:15:30.186
I had you beat like eggs.

116
00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.184
Heck you did.

117
00:15:32.388 --> 00:15:35.479
Anybody watching could've seen
I had you right where I wanted you.


118
00:15:35.688 --> 00:15:37.620
In your dreams.

119
00:15:38.222 --> 00:15:39.778
You're an accident.

120
00:15:39.989 --> 00:15:41.648
You never should've happened.

121
00:15:41.855 --> 00:15:44.377
Your mind ain't right, Octopus.

122
00:15:44.588 --> 00:15:48.611
You're talking crazy.
You're talking crazy talk.


123
00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:51.617
We're the only two like us, pretty boy.

124
00:15:51.822 --> 00:15:54.015
-I'm nothing like you.
-Nothing like me?


125
00:15:56.022 --> 00:15:59.886
Well, you sure can take
a lot of punishment, sweetheart.


126
00:16:00.089 --> 00:16:01.349
Just like me.

127
00:16:03.155 --> 00:16:04.178
You ever wonder why?

128
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:09.780
Never even crossed my mind.

129
00:16:09.989 --> 00:16:12.148
Well, I'll be learning you!

130
00:16:12.355 --> 00:16:16.220
I'll be learning you real soon.

131
00:16:16.421 --> 00:16:18.183
I'll be learning you.

132
00:16:24.755 --> 00:16:26.220
Oh, well, look who's here.

133
00:16:26.421 --> 00:16:28.887
Boss, we better get out of here.

134
00:16:43.155 --> 00:16:45.313
Such pain.

135
00:16:45.755 --> 00:16:47.983
Such suffering.

136
00:16:49.421 --> 00:16:51.115
Sleep.

137
00:16:54.588 --> 00:16:56.918
Come on, come on, come on.

138
00:16:57.122 --> 00:16:58.678
Wake up.

139
00:16:59.855 --> 00:17:01.480
Wake up.

140
00:17:03.855 --> 00:17:05.048
Wake up.

141
00:17:05.255 --> 00:17:06.619
Hey, baby.

142
00:17:06.822 --> 00:17:08.651
-Ellen.
-You're a mess.


143
00:17:09.188 --> 00:17:10.848
Three bullets across the deltoid.

144
00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:13.418
They went straight through me.
Hardly took any meat.


145
00:17:13.622 --> 00:17:15.713
Major contusions on any visible skin.

146
00:17:15.922 --> 00:17:17.751
Oh, come on, Ellen.
They never last long.


147
00:17:17.955 --> 00:17:20.944
Evidence of a profusely bleeding
cranial wound.


148
00:17:21.155 --> 00:17:23.245
No, that's nothing. 
That's just a bump.

149
00:17:23.455 --> 00:17:25.284
Yeah, you're a mess, all right.

150
00:17:25.488 --> 00:17:27.852
-Really, I'm okay.
-No, this is serious.


151
00:17:28.055 --> 00:17:30.452
For God's sake,
you can't keep taking these chances.


152
00:17:30.655 --> 00:17:33.644
-I'll be fine.
-You're bleeding out of your head.


153
00:17:38.522 --> 00:17:41.579
-It's gone all sticky. It'll stop.
-You need to be admitted.


154
00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:44.879
No. You know how much I hate that.
It takes forever.


155
00:17:45.089 --> 00:17:48.452
-Don't fight me this time.
-I'll be all right. It's just--


156
00:17:48.655 --> 00:17:51.348
I'm missing something.
It's really important.


157
00:17:52.855 --> 00:17:54.582
-Do you know where you are?
-Sure.


158
00:17:54.788 --> 00:17:57.345
-What city?
-Central City, U.S.A.


159
00:17:57.555 --> 00:17:58.919
What year is it?

160
00:17:59.121 --> 00:18:00.712
This year.

161
00:18:00.922 --> 00:18:02.979
-Do you know who you are?
-The Spirit.


162
00:18:03.188 --> 00:18:05.654
-I beat up bad guys.
-And sometimes they beat you up.


163
00:18:05.855 --> 00:18:08.821
And it really hurts when that happens,
but I always get better.


164
00:18:09.022 --> 00:18:12.351
I don't know why. You don't know why.
But The Octopus knows something.


165
00:18:12.555 --> 00:18:13.543
Why do you say that?

166
00:18:13.755 --> 00:18:15.550
Because he told me
he knows something.


167
00:18:16.522 --> 00:18:18.818
-You're delirious. Come on.
-No.


168
00:18:19.889 --> 00:18:21.684
Oh, golly, will you look at that.

169
00:18:22.488 --> 00:18:23.545
That was close, buddy.

170
00:18:23.755 --> 00:18:26.051
I was looking all over for you.

171
00:18:27.889 --> 00:18:30.014
There. That's better.

172
00:18:30.221 --> 00:18:32.449
Yup. That's better.

173
00:18:33.522 --> 00:18:34.852
That tears it.

174
00:18:35.055 --> 00:18:36.179
You're delusional.

175
00:18:36.388 --> 00:18:37.854
-Tuska, over here!
-Ellen!


176
00:18:39.455 --> 00:18:42.683
Dr. Ellen Dolan! 
Over here, right now!

177
00:18:47.055 --> 00:18:48.520
I can hear fluid in his chest.

178
00:18:48.722 --> 00:18:50.381
It's faint, but I swear it's there.

179
00:18:56.922 --> 00:18:59.047
I got it. He's got blood
in both his lungs.


180
00:18:59.255 --> 00:19:00.812
Stabilize him, get him on Pegasus.

181
00:19:01.022 --> 00:19:03.214
-Go back to the helicopter.
-I'll flip him over.


182
00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:06.114
No, leave him flat. Get me new gloves.
Gauze.


183
00:19:10.889 --> 00:19:14.787
Hurry it up. If you can't move any faster,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.


184
00:19:14.989 --> 00:19:17.386
-You find anything?
-No, sir.


185
00:19:17.588 --> 00:19:19.952
I'm just feeling dizzy
from all the action, I guess.


186
00:19:20.154 --> 00:19:22.450
-Yeah, we're all damn impressed.
-Thanks.


187
00:19:22.655 --> 00:19:25.120
You're doing this town no good
with your hot-dogging.


188
00:19:25.321 --> 00:19:27.480
-I don't follow you.
-We're flat on our asses...


189
00:19:27.688 --> 00:19:29.950
...happy to clean up
after your dog-and-pony show.


190
00:19:30.154 --> 00:19:31.848
Not this again. 
You know the score.

191
00:19:32.054 --> 00:19:33.987
I thought I did.
Go ahead and enlighten me.


192
00:19:34.188 --> 00:19:35.381
Bring me up to speed.

193
00:19:35.588 --> 00:19:38.110
Sussman wanted things kept quiet.
Leave it at that.


194
00:19:38.321 --> 00:19:39.912
He thinks I don't run a tight ship?

195
00:19:40.121 --> 00:19:43.519
Suspected a leak in your department.
Didn't want The Octopus getting away.


196
00:19:43.722 --> 00:19:46.779
So you're lnternal Affairs now, huh?
I must have missed that memo.


197
00:19:46.989 --> 00:19:49.546
Come on, it was a judgment call.
I gave it my best shot.


198
00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:52.949
I got one officer an inch from dying,
another, his head yanked off...


199
00:19:53.154 --> 00:19:55.620
...because you went off half-cocked
after The Octopus.


200
00:19:55.822 --> 00:19:58.310
You're damn right
I'm going after The Octopus!


201
00:19:58.522 --> 00:20:00.784
And you're going through my men
like toilet paper.


202
00:20:00.989 --> 00:20:02.579
You been to Dropsie Avenue and C?

203
00:20:02.788 --> 00:20:04.276
-Have you seen those girls?
-Yeah.


204
00:20:04.488 --> 00:20:08.113
Some just learning how to ride a bike,
there they are, selling their souls...


205
00:20:08.321 --> 00:20:10.446
...slaves to The Octopus
and his poison.


206
00:20:10.655 --> 00:20:15.314
Maybe you and your force
could use a little obsession, Dolan.


207
00:20:15.522 --> 00:20:19.045
Maybe you and your force
could work a little harder.


208
00:20:19.255 --> 00:20:22.779
Ellen's right. You're off your rocker,
talking about cops like that.


209
00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:25.386
Maybe if you and your force
could find The Octopus...


210
00:20:25.588 --> 00:20:28.349
-...I wouldn't have to play it solo.
-Solo, huh?


211
00:20:28.555 --> 00:20:29.578
Solo?

212
00:20:29.788 --> 00:20:31.686
That wasn't our deal, hotshot.

213
00:20:31.889 --> 00:20:34.719
Well, then maybe we don't have a deal
anymore, commissioner.


214
00:20:35.555 --> 00:20:36.543
Why, you....

215
00:20:43.488 --> 00:20:45.647
You're living at the
edge of a cliff, son.

216
00:20:45.855 --> 00:20:49.844
And all you got is a tired old man
trying to hold you back.


217
00:20:50.655 --> 00:20:53.712
Look, we're both tired.

218
00:20:55.788 --> 00:20:57.253
Yeah.

219
00:20:57.755 --> 00:21:00.619
-Yeah.
-Just give me 1 0 minutes.


220
00:21:01.655 --> 00:21:04.849
Hell, I don't know why I even bother
to try and talk to you anymore.


221
00:21:05.054 --> 00:21:07.418
Just give me 1 0 minutes.

222
00:21:07.622 --> 00:21:09.144
Just to clear my head.

223
00:21:09.355 --> 00:21:11.548
Right. Sure.

224
00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:16.617
What's 1 0 minutes
in a man's life anyway?


225
00:21:17.255 --> 00:21:18.278
Spirit?

226
00:21:18.488 --> 00:21:20.010
Sir.

227
00:21:20.988 --> 00:21:23.954
That cliff I was talking about?

228
00:21:24.355 --> 00:21:26.184
There's no bottom.

229
00:21:27.655 --> 00:21:29.348
Don't jump.

230
00:21:34.988 --> 00:21:38.716
"What are you?"
That's what the woman asked me.


231
00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:40.854
It's a good question.

232
00:21:41.054 --> 00:21:43.486
I wish I had an answer for her.

233
00:21:43.688 --> 00:21:45.949
Am I a crazy man?

234
00:21:46.288 --> 00:21:48.777
Or am I a man at all?

235
00:21:49.988 --> 00:21:51.614
Some nights, like this one...

236
00:21:51.822 --> 00:21:55.015
... when the wind bites deep,
bone deep...


237
00:21:55.221 --> 00:21:59.381
...and even my city
seems to leave me behind, I wonder;.


238
00:21:59.588 --> 00:22:01.417
Am I some sort of ghost?

239
00:22:01.622 --> 00:22:04.213
Some sort of Flying Dutchman?

240
00:22:04.455 --> 00:22:06.886
If the wind picked up
hard enough...


241
00:22:07.154 --> 00:22:09.279
... would I just blow away?

242
00:22:09.921 --> 00:22:11.444
I'm not a cop.

243
00:22:11.655 --> 00:22:13.518
Not anymore.

244
00:22:14.021 --> 00:22:16.385
Not even a dead man.

245
00:22:17.421 --> 00:22:19.683
Not even a spirit.

246
00:22:22.622 --> 00:22:25.452
We made it, boss.
Just like you said we would.


247
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:30.146
You still here?

248
00:22:30.755 --> 00:22:34.744
Of course I'm still here. I'm your trigger.
I blowed holes right through The Spirit.


249
00:22:34.954 --> 00:22:37.318
You're a trigger, Pathos.

250
00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:38.647
Just look at you.

251
00:22:39.722 --> 00:22:41.654
Quick Draw McGraw himself.

252
00:22:41.854 --> 00:22:44.150
I'll be great.
I don't have any bones sticking out.


253
00:22:44.355 --> 00:22:46.514
A couple of splints, 
I'll be good to go.

254
00:22:46.722 --> 00:22:50.381
Yeah, just hop right over to St. Alice's,
get fixed up all nice and new.


255
00:22:50.588 --> 00:22:53.349
I'll have to explain why
a criminal mastermind like myself...


256
00:22:53.555 --> 00:22:56.077
...doesn't provide his employees
with medical insurance.


257
00:22:56.288 --> 00:22:58.720
That'd be egg on my face, Pathos.

258
00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:03.377
You know I don't like
egg on my face.


259
00:23:03.588 --> 00:23:05.213
-Hadn't thought of that.
-No.


260
00:23:05.421 --> 00:23:08.717
Using your brain?
That, you weren't built for.


261
00:23:08.921 --> 00:23:10.785
Just tell me
where the emergency room is.


262
00:23:10.988 --> 00:23:14.443
I'll tell them I'm one of the homelesses.
They don't make them pay.


263
00:23:14.655 --> 00:23:16.780
Homelesses always get hurt.
Because it's free.


264
00:23:16.988 --> 00:23:18.682
-That'll work!
-So will this.


265
00:23:22.854 --> 00:23:26.911
No egg on my face!

266
00:23:27.388 --> 00:23:28.786
Not a glob!

267
00:23:32.221 --> 00:23:34.119
Not a glob.

268
00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:44.787
Any other case, little buddy.

269
00:23:44.988 --> 00:23:47.045
Any other job.

270
00:23:47.388 --> 00:23:49.945
If it were anyone but her.

271
00:23:53.088 --> 00:23:54.714
Sand.

272
00:23:55.522 --> 00:23:58.352
Sand Saref.

273
00:24:07.455 --> 00:24:08.682
Where's your bike?

274
00:24:08.888 --> 00:24:11.184
You scrape your knee,
or are you scared for a race?


275
00:24:11.388 --> 00:24:13.354
No, I got sick of that stupid bike.

276
00:24:13.555 --> 00:24:16.419
You got sick of losing races to me
is more like it.


277
00:24:16.988 --> 00:24:17.976
Where'd you put it?

278
00:24:18.588 --> 00:24:20.713
I pawned it over at Fellman's.

279
00:24:20.921 --> 00:24:23.751
-I got a few bucks for it.
-Pawned it?


280
00:24:27.522 --> 00:24:29.044
Look there.

281
00:24:30.054 --> 00:24:31.486
I bet those are real diamonds.

282
00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:35.179
You see how they catch the light,
Denny?


283
00:24:36.255 --> 00:24:38.380
Only real ones do that.

284
00:24:44.655 --> 00:24:46.518
What's with you?

285
00:24:47.488 --> 00:24:48.885
Nothing much.

286
00:24:49.088 --> 00:24:52.145
-He's not drinking again, is he?
-No, no, he's not drinking.


287
00:24:52.355 --> 00:24:53.980
What's got you needing money, then?

288
00:24:54.954 --> 00:24:58.852
Just something that I saw
over at the window at Kurtzman's.


289
00:24:59.054 --> 00:25:00.486
Is it a badge, like my dad's?

290
00:25:00.688 --> 00:25:02.119
No, no. It wasn't a badge.

291
00:25:02.321 --> 00:25:04.116
Good, you ain't hardly
earned a badge.


292
00:25:04.321 --> 00:25:07.775
Well, it was something
that I thought that, you know...


293
00:25:09.188 --> 00:25:13.211
...you might like seeing
as how you like shiny things and all.


294
00:25:19.221 --> 00:25:23.676
It opens up too.
You can take it and look at the picture.


295
00:25:25.121 --> 00:25:28.417
If you don't like it, old man Kurtzman
said he'd take it back.


296
00:25:32.888 --> 00:25:34.479
Do you like it?

297
00:25:41.687 --> 00:25:43.676
So you want me to be your girl?

298
00:25:45.288 --> 00:25:48.277
Yeah, sure. I mean, if--

299
00:25:48.488 --> 00:25:50.215
You know, if it's
all the same to you.

300
00:25:50.421 --> 00:25:53.216
Well, I suppose I can wear it
now and then.


301
00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:59.581
-But that doesn't make me your girl.
-Yeah. Doesn't make....


302
00:26:12.687 --> 00:26:15.653
Yeah, we had us a time, all right.

303
00:26:15.854 --> 00:26:17.480
The way only city kids could.

304
00:26:18.088 --> 00:26:19.179
I love it!

305
00:26:33.088 --> 00:26:35.849
It says here Heracles himself
fought with the Argonauts.


306
00:26:36.488 --> 00:26:39.386
Imagine Jason and Heracles
back-to-back.


307
00:26:39.588 --> 00:26:42.610
-Yeah.
-Jason gleaming in his Golden Fleece.


308
00:26:42.821 --> 00:26:45.014
Yeah. Yeah.

309
00:27:02.355 --> 00:27:05.809
Then everything went right
straight to hell.


310
00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:09.987
My Uncle Pete was
a has-been fighter.


311
00:27:10.188 --> 00:27:13.984
Sand's dad, a beat cop who was
always looking out for dumb old Pete.


312
00:27:14.188 --> 00:27:17.676
Hey, Pete! What's all this?
What's all--?


313
00:27:27.754 --> 00:27:31.016
My Uncle Pete did the only thing
his punch-battered brain...


314
00:27:31.221 --> 00:27:33.187
...could tell him to do.

315
00:27:37.488 --> 00:27:40.817
Sand got there
a few minutes before me.


316
00:27:43.687 --> 00:27:44.675
Come on.

317
00:27:44.888 --> 00:27:47.514
I tried to be
strong for both of us.

318
00:27:48.221 --> 00:27:49.686
Come on.

319
00:27:50.921 --> 00:27:54.819
I said some stuff.
I can't remember what.


320
00:27:56.021 --> 00:27:58.680
And then that jerk reporter
latched onto us.


321
00:27:58.888 --> 00:27:59.945
Sol, I can't miss this.

322
00:28:00.154 --> 00:28:02.245
So, kids, just how does this
make you feel?


323
00:28:02.455 --> 00:28:03.545
Are you scared?

324
00:28:03.754 --> 00:28:06.845
-We ain't talking, so leave us alone.
-You gotta give me something.


325
00:28:07.821 --> 00:28:09.014
I'll give you something.

326
00:28:09.221 --> 00:28:11.187
I'll give you three words.

327
00:28:11.854 --> 00:28:13.547
I hate cops.

328
00:28:13.754 --> 00:28:15.186
Just leave us alone, will you?

329
00:28:18.888 --> 00:28:21.513
I know you're heartbroke, Sand.

330
00:28:22.088 --> 00:28:24.020
So am l,
but you didn't mean what you said.


331
00:28:24.221 --> 00:28:25.618
Leave me alone, stay away.

332
00:28:25.821 --> 00:28:27.548
-Give it a while.
-Give it a while?


333
00:28:27.754 --> 00:28:30.811
-What? What, us?
-Well, yeah, that's what I mean.


334
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:33.885
So, sure, we grow up
and we have kids in this sinkhole?


335
00:28:34.088 --> 00:28:35.713
You're just not talking straight.

336
00:28:35.921 --> 00:28:38.944
And you become a cop
just like you always wanted to.


337
00:28:39.787 --> 00:28:42.049
Yeah. Yeah, maybe I do.

338
00:28:42.255 --> 00:28:46.119
Yeah, and then some punched-out
drunk of an old boxer shoots you dead?


339
00:28:46.321 --> 00:28:48.513
-Do you think I want that?
-lt wasn't Pete!


340
00:28:48.721 --> 00:28:51.812
-lt was that guido, and you know that.
-Who cares?


341
00:28:52.021 --> 00:28:54.180
You know what?
I don't want your world.


342
00:28:54.388 --> 00:28:57.512
I want diamonds,
and I want sports cars...


343
00:28:57.721 --> 00:29:01.119
...and I want long dresses
and I want money. And I want lots of it.


344
00:29:01.321 --> 00:29:04.151
And where are you going to find
all that, Sand?


345
00:29:04.355 --> 00:29:07.344
I'm not gonna find it here.
Not in this toilet of a town.


346
00:29:07.721 --> 00:29:11.119
So you're too good for me?
You're too good for all of us? Is that it?


347
00:29:13.255 --> 00:29:16.687
I am too good for you,
and I am too good for this dump.


348
00:29:17.355 --> 00:29:19.718
-I'm going away, I'm going far away.
-All right.


349
00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:22.012
I'm gonna go
all over the world, become rich...


350
00:29:22.221 --> 00:29:25.244
...and no one is ever gonna know
that I came from this hole!


351
00:29:25.454 --> 00:29:27.045
No one.
And I am never coming back.


352
00:29:27.454 --> 00:29:28.920
Then do whatever you want, Sand!

353
00:29:30.388 --> 00:29:33.377
I don't care about you neither.
I never even wanna see you again!


354
00:29:33.587 --> 00:29:35.678
I hate you, Sand.

355
00:29:41.854 --> 00:29:43.979
I never saw her again.

356
00:29:45.121 --> 00:29:47.586
Word is she took off for Europe.

357
00:29:48.587 --> 00:29:51.519
I never knew if
she was alive or dead.

358
00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.409
Until now.

359
00:29:57.621 --> 00:30:00.587
There's only one way this locket
ended up in poor Sussman's hand.


360
00:30:00.787 --> 00:30:03.753
She was there. She was wearing it.
She is implicated.


361
00:30:03.954 --> 00:30:05.886
If she's doing business
with The Octopus...


362
00:30:06.088 --> 00:30:07.781
...then my feelings
don't mean a damn.


363
00:30:07.988 --> 00:30:10.419
I must find Sand Saref...

364
00:30:10.621 --> 00:30:12.519
...and bring her in.

365
00:30:21.521 --> 00:30:23.749
My beautiful Sand Saref.

366
00:30:23.954 --> 00:30:26.216
Are you missing something, my love?

367
00:30:27.188 --> 00:30:29.245
Nothing important.

368
00:30:31.255 --> 00:30:34.482
Just something I lost a long time ago.

369
00:30:44.088 --> 00:30:46.485
Mark this moment, all of you.

370
00:30:46.687 --> 00:30:49.017
A new age begins.

371
00:30:49.221 --> 00:30:51.278
An age of great deeds.

372
00:30:51.487 --> 00:30:55.442
An age of great power.

373
00:30:55.654 --> 00:30:57.745
Yes.

374
00:30:58.088 --> 00:31:00.576
All mine.

375
00:31:01.088 --> 00:31:04.713
The blood of Heracles is mine.

376
00:31:30.487 --> 00:31:33.385
I am sorely disappointed.

377
00:31:35.354 --> 00:31:36.877
Which one of you brought me this?

378
00:31:37.088 --> 00:31:38.747
I guess that'd be me.

379
00:31:39.154 --> 00:31:41.915
-On your knees, then.
-Sure thing.


380
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:45.352
What happened?
What went wrong?


381
00:31:45.554 --> 00:31:47.349
Nothing went wrong,
thanks for asking.


382
00:31:47.554 --> 00:31:50.315
Where's my vase? I'm supposed
to have a vase full of blood.


383
00:31:50.521 --> 00:31:53.715
-It's supposed to be in that box.
-Must've been in the other box.


384
00:31:53.921 --> 00:31:55.046
What other box?

385
00:31:55.255 --> 00:31:57.379
Must've been in the other box.

386
00:31:57.587 --> 00:31:59.450
What other box, you fart?

387
00:31:59.954 --> 00:32:02.647
The one the pretty lady run off with.
We was watching.


388
00:32:02.854 --> 00:32:04.150
Sand Saref.

389
00:32:04.487 --> 00:32:07.817
I thought I scared her off
with time to spare.


390
00:32:08.387 --> 00:32:10.512
What's she doing in Central City,
anyway?


391
00:32:10.721 --> 00:32:16.177
It didn't occur to you doorstops to
mention that there was a second box?


392
00:32:16.387 --> 00:32:19.615
Nope, but it looked just like this one.
We was watching.


393
00:32:21.754 --> 00:32:24.743
Seppuku across the stomach,
left to right.


394
00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.980
That tickles.

395
00:32:29.221 --> 00:32:32.016
With the sword, toe cheese.

396
00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:38.619
So Sand Saref has the blood.

397
00:32:38.821 --> 00:32:42.309
You know, you could've offed her
and brought back both boxes.


398
00:32:42.521 --> 00:32:44.714
That would've simplified things
considerably.


399
00:32:44.921 --> 00:32:47.183
Oh, I'm supposed
to do everything around here?


400
00:32:47.687 --> 00:32:49.312
Now, that'll wake you up.

401
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:51.510
You have to do something
about Sand Saref.


402
00:32:51.721 --> 00:32:54.119
Don't worry about Sand Saref.

403
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.514
That lady's got a thing for the bling.

404
00:32:57.854 --> 00:33:01.547
She was after that other box
and whatever it is that's inside of it.


405
00:33:01.754 --> 00:33:04.311
It's kind of creepy
the way it glows like that.


406
00:33:04.521 --> 00:33:07.510
So the situation's hardly a debacle.

407
00:33:07.721 --> 00:33:11.017
Sand Saref has
the blood of Heracles, yes.


408
00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.209
But we have what she wants.

409
00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:17.409
-All right, you fatheads listening to me?
-We sure are, boss.


410
00:33:17.621 --> 00:33:21.280
Find Sand Saref, find her now.
Tell her I have no problem with her.


411
00:33:21.487 --> 00:33:24.612
She can have her creepy,
blingy thingy.


412
00:33:25.921 --> 00:33:27.716
Get me that blood.

413
00:33:27.921 --> 00:33:29.012
And keep it safe!

414
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.948
Spill one drop
and I'll turn you all into hamburger.


415
00:33:32.154 --> 00:33:35.608
Don't forget about The Spirit.
He's someone to contend with.


416
00:33:35.821 --> 00:33:40.549
He's like a piece of gum stuck to the
bottom of your shoe that won't let go.


417
00:33:40.754 --> 00:33:42.152
You know what I mean?

418
00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:45.514
The kind you step on in the summer
that just won't let go.


419
00:33:45.721 --> 00:33:47.550
Am I doing this right?

420
00:33:47.754 --> 00:33:49.185
Yeah, looks good.

421
00:33:49.387 --> 00:33:51.478
I was just wondering,
because it really smarts.


422
00:33:51.687 --> 00:33:53.619
I hate stepping on gum,
even in winter.


423
00:33:53.821 --> 00:33:55.810
Makes you step funny.

424
00:33:56.287 --> 00:33:59.981
We're gonna kill The Spirit,
and we're gonna kill him now.


425
00:34:00.187 --> 00:34:01.448
Or sometime soon.

426
00:34:01.654 --> 00:34:03.279
He doesn't publish his address.

427
00:34:03.487 --> 00:34:05.885
We're not going to look for him.

428
00:34:06.088 --> 00:34:08.315
He's gonna come to us. Real soon.

429
00:34:08.954 --> 00:34:10.852
You have a plan.

430
00:34:11.054 --> 00:34:15.213
I left the man a clue
that will lead him right to us.


431
00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.978
Right soon, I promise.

432
00:34:18.187 --> 00:34:20.346
What's the hurries, anyway?

433
00:34:20.554 --> 00:34:23.077
If The Spirit drinks the blood...

434
00:34:23.287 --> 00:34:26.651
...if he so much as realizes
what it could do to him...


435
00:34:26.854 --> 00:34:29.285
...what it could turn him into,
then we're finished.


436
00:34:29.687 --> 00:34:31.346
And because I said so.

437
00:34:31.554 --> 00:34:33.782
I am a man
of my word, Ms. Saref.

438
00:34:36.187 --> 00:34:37.448
Are you?

439
00:34:37.654 --> 00:34:40.916
Take the promises you made
to your lovely new wife.


440
00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.087
"Forsaking all others," and all that.

441
00:34:43.287 --> 00:34:45.378
Let's not get personal, shall we?

442
00:34:45.587 --> 00:34:48.246
Oh, we shall.

443
00:34:48.454 --> 00:34:51.943
I commissioned you to find a certain
treasure for me, Mr. Donenfeld.


444
00:34:52.153 --> 00:34:55.176
It was to mark
the climax of my career.

445
00:34:55.921 --> 00:34:58.080
Its crown jewel.

446
00:34:58.287 --> 00:35:01.879
The lost treasure of the Argonauts.

447
00:35:02.088 --> 00:35:05.850
And it was even worth me
coming back to this horrid city...


448
00:35:06.487 --> 00:35:08.282
...just to touch it.

449
00:35:08.487 --> 00:35:09.783
To hold it.

450
00:35:09.988 --> 00:35:12.045
To have it be mine.

451
00:35:12.254 --> 00:35:16.152
The shiny thing
to end all shiny things.


452
00:35:16.521 --> 00:35:20.180
And I paid you a fortune for it.

453
00:35:20.387 --> 00:35:24.513
And it would've been worth
every nickel, but you screwed me.


454
00:35:24.721 --> 00:35:27.482
So now we're gonna take
every last one of those nickels...


455
00:35:27.687 --> 00:35:30.084
...and transfer them
into another bunch of accounts.


456
00:35:30.287 --> 00:35:32.344
What on earth are you talking about?

457
00:35:32.554 --> 00:35:34.452
You're gonna be
quite the philanthropist.


458
00:35:35.087 --> 00:35:39.179
Oh, type the numbers in for him,
darling. He seems a tad dyspeptic.


459
00:35:39.387 --> 00:35:42.376
I'm going to need your password,
sweetheart.


460
00:35:50.954 --> 00:35:52.442
All right.

461
00:35:52.654 --> 00:35:54.119
All right.

462
00:35:54.821 --> 00:35:56.480
It's robin.

463
00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:58.619
R
-O
-B-l
-N. Like the bird.

464
00:35:58.821 --> 00:36:00.343
Or like the kid sidekick.

465
00:36:00.554 --> 00:36:04.782
You know, the one with the cute
little tights and the tight little derriÃ¨re.


466
00:36:05.654 --> 00:36:07.552
It's going through.

467
00:36:08.954 --> 00:36:10.146
Transfer complete.

468
00:36:12.053 --> 00:36:13.986
Why the devil are you
doing this to me?


469
00:36:14.187 --> 00:36:15.949
You sold me out.

470
00:36:16.153 --> 00:36:18.676
-I didn't have any choice.
-lmagine my surprise...


471
00:36:18.888 --> 00:36:21.945
...when I show up at the drop point
and ran smack into The Octopus.


472
00:36:22.554 --> 00:36:24.611
I mean, what are the odds of that?

473
00:36:25.821 --> 00:36:29.844
Unless you sold
the Argo's treasure twice...


474
00:36:30.053 --> 00:36:33.383
...making a perfect ass of yourself.

475
00:36:35.387 --> 00:36:37.683
A perfect ass.

476
00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:40.316
Well, he didn't give me any choice.

477
00:36:40.754 --> 00:36:43.276
-He's The Octopus, he threatened my--
-Your family.


478
00:36:44.487 --> 00:36:46.783
Take a good look at those pictures.

479
00:36:46.988 --> 00:36:51.249
They'll reach your family and every
news service on the planet...


480
00:36:51.454 --> 00:36:54.079
...unless you render them irrelevant.

481
00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.886
At least die bravely...

482
00:37:00.454 --> 00:37:02.147
...rodent.

483
00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.177
Hold all calls.

484
00:37:21.621 --> 00:37:23.610
Excuse me, got any change?

485
00:37:28.454 --> 00:37:30.443
What can I say?

486
00:37:30.654 --> 00:37:34.017
Last night you were 20 minutes
from the morgue, and now look at you.


487
00:37:35.187 --> 00:37:36.744
Just look at you.

488
00:37:38.621 --> 00:37:42.451
I'd recommend three days' bed rest,
but why waste my breath?


489
00:37:42.654 --> 00:37:44.779
Look who's talking.
You take the night off.


490
00:37:44.987 --> 00:37:47.647
Yeah, I'm sure Mrs. Mahoney's
heart transplant can wait.


491
00:37:47.854 --> 00:37:52.286
And we might as well just hold off and
see if old Spankowitz's liver explodes.


492
00:37:52.487 --> 00:37:55.715
You need to have some fun.
Put your feet up, relax.


493
00:37:55.921 --> 00:37:57.511
Maybe go see a show.

494
00:37:59.554 --> 00:38:01.645
What about you, big man?

495
00:38:02.987 --> 00:38:05.579
-What's on your agenda tonight?
-Oh, I don't know.


496
00:38:05.787 --> 00:38:08.275
Things stay quiet,
I'd be up for anything.


497
00:38:08.721 --> 00:38:10.619
-Anything?
-Sure, anything.


498
00:38:10.821 --> 00:38:11.809
Dinner, movie.

499
00:38:12.387 --> 00:38:14.012
Anything.

500
00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.684
-So long as things stay quiet?
-Yeah.


501
00:38:17.888 --> 00:38:20.479
-So long as things stay quiet.
-Sure.


502
00:38:20.687 --> 00:38:23.744
Like every crook in Central City
goes on sabbatical?


503
00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.177
Or maybe if I break the rules.

504
00:38:28.854 --> 00:38:31.183
I feel like breaking all kinds of rules.

505
00:38:31.387 --> 00:38:33.182
-Lower the blinds.
-They're all down.


506
00:38:33.387 --> 00:38:35.080
Oh, fast hands.

507
00:38:35.287 --> 00:38:36.480
And quiet.

508
00:38:36.687 --> 00:38:39.016
-And sneaky.
-We'll keep things quiet, all right.


509
00:38:39.387 --> 00:38:41.012
Very, very quiet.

510
00:38:42.854 --> 00:38:46.513
Keep the mask on. Something tells me
it might be better that way.


511
00:38:56.687 --> 00:38:58.050
Oh, Ellen, I lo--

512
00:38:58.254 --> 00:39:01.812
You're in love with every woman
you meet, Mr. Spirit.


513
00:39:03.521 --> 00:39:05.282
You say lovely things to all of us...

514
00:39:06.287 --> 00:39:09.549
...and you mean every word you say.
Every time.


515
00:39:09.754 --> 00:39:12.185
Ellen, it's only you.

516
00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:15.750
But we don't even know
your real name.


517
00:39:17.153 --> 00:39:19.051
I'll tell you my name.

518
00:39:22.354 --> 00:39:24.718
Someday I'd love to do
your autopsy.


519
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.352
Oh, thanks for the thought.

520
00:39:26.554 --> 00:39:28.019
I'd make a fortune.

521
00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.345
Spirit! Front and center!

522
00:39:31.821 --> 00:39:34.787
-He's all yours. Fresh as a daisy.
-You should get some sleep.


523
00:39:34.987 --> 00:39:37.146
-You look like hell.
-Love you too, Daddy.


524
00:39:37.354 --> 00:39:40.445
It's an honor to meet you, Mr. Spirit.
I'm Morgenstern.


525
00:39:40.654 --> 00:39:43.176
Rookie, fresh from Baltimore.

526
00:39:44.621 --> 00:39:46.314
Good to have you aboard,
Morgenstern.


527
00:39:48.454 --> 00:39:50.647
Come on,
we haven't got the whole day.


528
00:39:57.654 --> 00:40:00.484
-Dr. Dolan, I can't thank you enough.
-Just doing my job, sir.


529
00:40:04.787 --> 00:40:05.911
Bastard.

530
00:40:11.687 --> 00:40:13.585
-Marry me.
-Just doing my job, sir.


531
00:40:13.786 --> 00:40:15.184
And what a job it is.

532
00:40:15.387 --> 00:40:17.615
Central City's own masked manhunter.

533
00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:19.480
You're worshipped by the kids.

534
00:40:19.687 --> 00:40:21.676
Anything you'd care
to share with them?


535
00:40:21.887 --> 00:40:24.853
Play it straight, youngsters.
Don't be too tough on your parents.


536
00:40:25.053 --> 00:40:27.178
They work hard. 
And remember...

537
00:40:27.387 --> 00:40:28.909
...brush your teeth.

538
00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.450
Every word a pearl of wisdom.

539
00:40:30.654 --> 00:40:32.983
Don't forget to remind them
to take their vitamins.


540
00:40:33.187 --> 00:40:34.448
And for the ladies?

541
00:40:34.654 --> 00:40:36.643
You know,
we hang on your every word.


542
00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:39.781
Well, I don't think I could say anything
other than thanks...


543
00:40:40.354 --> 00:40:43.752
...for being such amazing,
lovely creatures.


544
00:40:43.953 --> 00:40:45.112
No two alike.

545
00:40:48.554 --> 00:40:50.281
Jesus!

546
00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.651
-Ever meet a skirt you didn't chase?
-Just trying to be nice.


547
00:40:54.853 --> 00:40:56.285
You've been nice to my daughter.

548
00:40:56.487 --> 00:40:58.646
When will you break her heart,
lounge lizard?


549
00:40:58.853 --> 00:41:02.013
-Lounge lizard? Where do you get off?
-I'll call you anything I want.


550
00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.209
I don't know
why I bother talking with you.


551
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.318
Because we fight crime,
and right now we got our hands full.


552
00:41:07.521 --> 00:41:11.283
You noticed, have you? Thought with
all the tail you chase, you'd forgotten.


553
00:41:11.487 --> 00:41:12.714
It's The Octopus.

554
00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.386
Again with The Octopus.

555
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.742
He's up to something big
and it's got to do with me.


556
00:41:18.953 --> 00:41:20.885
He said some weird stuff
about him and me.


557
00:41:21.087 --> 00:41:23.679
I gotta find out what he's talking about.
It's important.


558
00:41:23.887 --> 00:41:25.217
Hold it.

559
00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.911
Can we forget about The Octopus
for one minute?


560
00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.949
Just one minute?

561
00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.380
Now, we got us a hot case
and a murder suspect...


562
00:41:35.587 --> 00:41:37.848
...who's hauling her butt
to the airport.


563
00:41:38.053 --> 00:41:39.679
-Her?
-Name is Sand Saref.


564
00:41:39.887 --> 00:41:41.716
-Sand Saref?
-Sand Saref.


565
00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.580
-Local girl.
-Only picture of her.


566
00:41:43.786 --> 00:41:44.979
It's over 1 5 years old.

567
00:41:45.187 --> 00:41:47.153
Father was a cop.
Took one in the face.


568
00:41:47.354 --> 00:41:49.286
Disappeared following
her father's murder--


569
00:41:49.487 --> 00:41:51.646
Told some snoop reporter
that she hated cops.


570
00:41:51.853 --> 00:41:54.615
-Right on TV, she said she hated cops.
-She hated cops.


571
00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.548
-That's what I said.
-Moved to Europe.


572
00:41:56.753 --> 00:41:59.947
Eight marriages later, runs every
jewelry heist this side of Bulgari.


573
00:42:00.153 --> 00:42:01.414
Except for in Central City.

574
00:42:01.621 --> 00:42:03.677
-She never came back.
-You never heard of her.


575
00:42:03.887 --> 00:42:07.342
-You never heard of her, right?
-She never came home.


576
00:42:07.786 --> 00:42:10.082
You on drugs or something?

577
00:42:11.953 --> 00:42:13.510
Come on.

578
00:42:14.554 --> 00:42:15.746
Behind the lines, folks.

579
00:42:15.953 --> 00:42:17.714
Behind the lines.

580
00:42:19.521 --> 00:42:21.646
-Commissioner.
-Sand Saref.


581
00:42:21.853 --> 00:42:24.081
She's overseen
hundreds of jewelry robberies...


582
00:42:24.287 --> 00:42:27.650
...and in not one case was
a police officer so much as wounded.


583
00:42:27.853 --> 00:42:29.876
Now, what are the odds
of that, huh?


584
00:42:30.087 --> 00:42:31.677
Sounds like an Electra complex.

585
00:42:31.887 --> 00:42:34.376
-What's that?
-Electra complex. Plain as your face.


586
00:42:34.587 --> 00:42:36.143
Honey, I'm just an alter cocker.

587
00:42:36.354 --> 00:42:37.785
Give me something to work with.

588
00:42:38.753 --> 00:42:39.776
Old fart.

589
00:42:39.987 --> 00:42:42.579
Jews today. Can't take time
to learn their own language.


590
00:42:42.786 --> 00:42:44.775
Electra complex.

591
00:42:44.987 --> 00:42:48.249
It's like an Oedipal complex
except it's for girls.


592
00:42:48.454 --> 00:42:50.079
She doesn't hate cops.

593
00:42:50.287 --> 00:42:52.344
She's just angry she lost her daddy.

594
00:42:52.554 --> 00:42:55.349
Electra complex, plain and simple.

595
00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.818
Damn. This girl's gonna
make detective in no time.


596
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.418
Thank you, sir.

597
00:43:01.454 --> 00:43:04.215
-You like her new jacket?
-Excuse me?


598
00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:07.147
You can't take your
eyes off the ladies.


599
00:43:07.354 --> 00:43:11.081
There's no chance in hell you haven't
noticed Morgenstern's new flak jacket.


600
00:43:11.287 --> 00:43:14.912
-Even if you are on drugs.
-I'm not on drugs.


601
00:43:17.287 --> 00:43:19.446
State of the art, these jackets.

602
00:43:19.653 --> 00:43:21.449
We had us a shipment
of these babies...


603
00:43:21.653 --> 00:43:23.983
...but we couldn't pay for them
until today...


604
00:43:24.187 --> 00:43:27.347
...when we got a very generous
private donation to the force.


605
00:43:27.554 --> 00:43:29.781
One hundred million dollars
generous.


606
00:43:29.987 --> 00:43:30.975
A lot of money.

607
00:43:31.187 --> 00:43:34.584
You're damn straight it is.
It was like a bolt out of the blue.


608
00:43:34.786 --> 00:43:37.480
An online donation. Anonymous.

609
00:43:37.686 --> 00:43:39.175
Yeah, sure, anonymous.

610
00:43:39.387 --> 00:43:42.682
Took our brain boys all of an hour
to track it right back here.


611
00:43:42.887 --> 00:43:46.149
To the offices of an expert
in ancient artifacts.


612
00:43:46.354 --> 00:43:49.411
Yeah, who turned said artifacts
into a fortune.


613
00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:52.018
You might say he was a purveyor
of stolen property...


614
00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.345
...or, as we put it in the vernacular,
a fence.


615
00:43:55.554 --> 00:43:59.486
A world-class fence
by the name of Donenfeld.


616
00:43:59.686 --> 00:44:00.674
Yeah.

617
00:44:00.887 --> 00:44:06.548
But quelle surprise, old Donenfeld,
he ain't looking so good.


618
00:44:07.254 --> 00:44:09.482
And my good buddy Seth here...

619
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.915
...he says the old man had a visitor...

620
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.484
...just about the same time
he got the hard goodbye.


621
00:44:14.686 --> 00:44:16.914
What did you say her name was
again there?


622
00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.348
Sand. Sand Saref.

623
00:44:19.553 --> 00:44:21.110
She didn't have an appointment.

624
00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.911
Sand Saref. Some moniker, huh?

625
00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.949
Yeah, it's a strange name.

626
00:44:27.153 --> 00:44:29.641
-It's one of a kind.
-Yeah.


627
00:44:30.853 --> 00:44:32.546
And my good buddy Seth here...

628
00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:36.208
...he couldn't be bothered
to even call it in.


629
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.477
My hands were tied, officer.

630
00:44:38.686 --> 00:44:41.016
Mr. Donenfeld had a standing order.

631
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:44.084
I was never to come into his office
unless he called me in.


632
00:44:44.287 --> 00:44:45.843
Never.

633
00:44:46.053 --> 00:44:48.110
Never, ever, ever.

634
00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.309
Yeah. Sure, kid.

635
00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.816
Morgenstern, get his number.

636
00:44:56.254 --> 00:44:58.482
No. Not murder, not her.

637
00:44:58.686 --> 00:45:00.312
It's not possible.

638
00:45:04.753 --> 00:45:07.219
-So you do know her.
-No.


639
00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.715
-lf you're holding back on me....
-I'm not.


640
00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.284
Your whole theory,
it doesn't make any sense.


641
00:45:12.486 --> 00:45:16.146
Hey, it fits together like goddamn
macramÃ© once you factor in her....


642
00:45:16.354 --> 00:45:18.081
What'd you call it again there?

643
00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:21.011
-Electra complex.
-Yeah, that.


644
00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:22.480
It's psychobabble.

645
00:45:22.853 --> 00:45:24.819
Trying to hang a murder rap
on that woman...


646
00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.610
...over some piece
of psychobabble?


647
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:30.684
Her name is Sand Saref and you
know her and you're covering for her.


648
00:45:30.887 --> 00:45:33.910
-I never heard of any Sand Saref.
-You're lying!


649
00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:36.779
-Get your hand off my arm, Dolan.
-You're lying to me.


650
00:45:36.987 --> 00:45:40.215
Let go of my arm
before I break yours.


651
00:45:45.254 --> 00:45:46.480
Orders, sir?

652
00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:48.808
Tail him.

653
00:45:50.586 --> 00:45:52.416
He's lying.

654
00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.280
You did a neat little job
up there, Sand.


655
00:45:58.486 --> 00:46:00.509
You shouldn't have signed it.

656
00:46:16.354 --> 00:46:21.013
Officer Morgenstern, you wanna help,
find me a lead to The Octopus.


657
00:46:27.553 --> 00:46:29.213
I will see it.

658
00:46:31.653 --> 00:46:32.983
-There.
-I'm in.


659
00:46:38.653 --> 00:46:41.949
And the aces have it.

660
00:46:54.586 --> 00:46:56.677
This I keep as a souvenir.

661
00:46:56.887 --> 00:47:00.444
The rest goes to the man who can
get a message to The Octopus.


662
00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:15.343
I thought I was closing in,
putting it all together.


663
00:47:15.553 --> 00:47:18.383
That three years on,
here in my second life...


664
00:47:18.586 --> 00:47:21.075
...I had a pretty good idea
of what I had to do.


665
00:47:21.287 --> 00:47:23.844
It all got down to me
and The Octopus.


666
00:47:24.053 --> 00:47:25.882
We were headed for a showdown.

667
00:47:26.087 --> 00:47:28.382
I was finally gonna scrub
the city clean of him...


668
00:47:28.586 --> 00:47:29.574
...once and for all.

669
00:47:29.786 --> 00:47:31.649
It wasn't pretty
but it was simple enough.


670
00:47:31.853 --> 00:47:34.217
Then you come along like
a sack of rocks to my face.


671
00:47:34.419 --> 00:47:37.215
What's the story, Sand?
What the heck is going on?


672
00:47:37.419 --> 00:47:39.715
All night, I've been rolling it around
in my skull.


673
00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.886
You and The Octopus?
You and murder?


674
00:47:43.087 --> 00:47:44.416
Dolan's gotta be wrong.

675
00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.677
There's gotta be more to this,
some explanation.


676
00:47:47.887 --> 00:47:49.853
Not murder, not you.

677
00:47:50.053 --> 00:47:52.416
Can't believe that about you.

678
00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:54.381
You were tough, Sand,
on the outside...


679
00:47:54.586 --> 00:47:56.246
...but inside, you were warm.

680
00:47:56.453 --> 00:47:58.544
And soft.

681
00:47:58.753 --> 00:48:01.117
All woman.

682
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.777
One thing I'd bet
my bottom dollar on:


683
00:48:03.987 --> 00:48:06.475
You wouldn't be caught dead
hiding out in a fleabag...


684
00:48:06.686 --> 00:48:09.209
...Iike any ordinary
criminal would. No.


685
00:48:09.419 --> 00:48:12.079
No, your taste was
always first-class.


686
00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:14.883
All the way.

687
00:48:18.353 --> 00:48:19.444
Weird.

688
00:48:21.419 --> 00:48:23.612
That's just plain damn weird.

689
00:48:23.820 --> 00:48:27.048
Sir, you promised the new
hyper-addictive synapse accelerant...


690
00:48:27.254 --> 00:48:29.378
...would be ready by last week.

691
00:48:29.586 --> 00:48:32.552
Don't you think
that's plain damn weird?


692
00:48:37.853 --> 00:48:41.285
Yes, sir. Just plain damn weird.

693
00:48:41.486 --> 00:48:43.918
Also, our profits
are down 20 percent.


694
00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:47.517
Good. I was beginning to think
it was just me.


695
00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.186
That's plain damn weird.

696
00:48:49.653 --> 00:48:50.676
Yes, sir.

697
00:48:50.887 --> 00:48:53.318
I was trying to
make us a smart one...

698
00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.816
...and this thing
just sort of popped out.


699
00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.747
Twenty percent across the board.

700
00:49:00.087 --> 00:49:03.348
Reduce the price on the old stuff,
we'll make it up in units.


701
00:49:03.553 --> 00:49:06.145
Word has hit the streets
about the side effects.


702
00:49:06.353 --> 00:49:09.410
No one likes having their teeth
turned into graham crackers.


703
00:49:10.453 --> 00:49:13.749
How can I get anything done
with all this time on my hands?


704
00:49:13.953 --> 00:49:16.680
Besides, when my buddies here
find Sand Saref...


705
00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:18.944
...I won't need profits,
I'll have the blood.


706
00:49:19.153 --> 00:49:21.345
Then if I want something,
I'll just take it.


707
00:49:21.553 --> 00:49:23.451
That's what gods do.

708
00:49:28.286 --> 00:49:31.446
He is really damn little.

709
00:49:32.319 --> 00:49:33.546
I mean...

710
00:49:33.753 --> 00:49:35.378
...it's really little.

711
00:49:35.586 --> 00:49:38.347
-They can't find her.
-Yeah, we can't find her.


712
00:49:38.553 --> 00:49:40.883
-We looked everywhere.
-Except where she was.


713
00:49:41.087 --> 00:49:43.019
-We should've looked there.
-We did look.


714
00:49:43.219 --> 00:49:45.118
-Where's that?
-Kill them all, please.


715
00:49:45.319 --> 00:49:46.580
Just kill them all.

716
00:49:46.786 --> 00:49:47.945
We can't spare them.

717
00:49:48.153 --> 00:49:49.277
-We're running low.
-Yeah.


718
00:49:49.486 --> 00:49:51.418
-You're running low on us.
-Floss said so.


719
00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.483
We was listening.

720
00:49:53.686 --> 00:49:55.709
I'm depressed.

721
00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:00.014
I wish The Spirit would come so
I could get me some real killing done.


722
00:50:00.219 --> 00:50:04.914
I told you already,
that's going to be complex.


723
00:50:13.586 --> 00:50:16.814
Spirit thinks he can't stay hurt.

724
00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:21.475
That stuff I put in him and me
is unstable.


725
00:50:21.887 --> 00:50:24.182
Might not last.

726
00:50:24.386 --> 00:50:27.012
The blood will take care of that.

727
00:50:27.553 --> 00:50:32.485
Meanwhile, I'm getting
El Espirito dead while I still can.


728
00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:34.649
To that end...

729
00:50:34.853 --> 00:50:37.341
...I got us another opinion.

730
00:50:37.786 --> 00:50:39.013
Brought in a specialist.

731
00:50:40.319 --> 00:50:43.945
Someone to seal the deal.

732
00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.485
You speak to my soul, monsieur.

733
00:51:06.353 --> 00:51:09.251
The black-eyed Venus
is in Suite 1 51 0.


734
00:51:12.653 --> 00:51:15.380
Long time no see, Sand.

735
00:51:21.486 --> 00:51:24.680
You gonna arrest me? Or do you have
something else in mind?


736
00:51:24.887 --> 00:51:26.443
I'm bringing you in.

737
00:51:26.653 --> 00:51:28.175
Hands behind your head.

738
00:51:29.987 --> 00:51:30.975
You sure about that?

739
00:51:31.353 --> 00:51:32.819
Don't make me repeat myself.

740
00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.815
Hands behind your head.

741
00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.383
Your wish is my command.

742
00:51:41.419 --> 00:51:42.510
Okay.

743
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:45.345
Put a robe on or something
but no tricks.


744
00:51:45.553 --> 00:51:48.178
Yes, sir, Mr. Spirit, sir.

745
00:51:51.953 --> 00:51:54.180
Oh, watch out for my husband,
you'll trip.


746
00:51:56.419 --> 00:51:58.408
Why this?

747
00:51:59.286 --> 00:52:02.377
It's not like I killed him.
He did it to himself about an hour ago.


748
00:52:02.586 --> 00:52:04.950
It's all the fault
of this goddamned vase.


749
00:52:05.152 --> 00:52:07.482
He tasted the stuff
and, well, see for yourself.


750
00:52:07.686 --> 00:52:10.277
-It's stolen.
-Oh, yeah.


751
00:52:10.486 --> 00:52:12.918
You are a common criminal.

752
00:52:13.119 --> 00:52:14.847
There's nothing common about me.

753
00:52:15.053 --> 00:52:19.212
You're a criminal. I'm bringing you in
for the murder of a fence, Donenfeld.


754
00:52:19.419 --> 00:52:21.045
If you're gonna lock me up...

755
00:52:21.253 --> 00:52:24.276
...do it over something
I am actually guilty of, stupid.


756
00:52:24.486 --> 00:52:25.747
Oh, you're guilty of a lot.

757
00:52:26.453 --> 00:52:30.078
I could burn a priest's ears
confessing the half of it.


758
00:52:30.286 --> 00:52:32.684
But this time, my hands are clean,
crime fighter.


759
00:52:32.887 --> 00:52:35.444
So run on home,
wait for the forensics report.


760
00:52:35.653 --> 00:52:38.017
I haven't shot anybody in days.

761
00:52:38.219 --> 00:52:41.310
There probably isn't a law
on the books that you wouldn't break.


762
00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.679
Do I look like a good girl?

763
00:52:44.486 --> 00:52:46.009
You don't care who you've hurt?

764
00:52:47.186 --> 00:52:49.175
What's that got to do with anything?

765
00:52:49.386 --> 00:52:53.682
Sand, The Octopus, that fence
and you?


766
00:52:55.186 --> 00:52:57.618
Now, after all of these....

767
00:53:00.753 --> 00:53:02.912
Nothing fits together.

768
00:53:03.119 --> 00:53:05.642
There's that crazy talk
from The Octopus about him and--


769
00:53:05.853 --> 00:53:07.682
Listen, mister...

770
00:53:07.887 --> 00:53:08.875
...I don't care.

771
00:53:09.086 --> 00:53:12.018
I don't even care about people
that I like and I don't know you.


772
00:53:12.219 --> 00:53:15.947
No, of course you don't.
But things, now, those you care about.


773
00:53:18.019 --> 00:53:20.451
I don't see what use
I could possibly be to you.


774
00:53:20.653 --> 00:53:23.312
I have nothing to offer
this rotten little town of yours.


775
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:26.384
As a matter of fact, I despise it.

776
00:53:26.586 --> 00:53:30.177
There's one thing between that river
and that ocean that I came here for.


777
00:53:30.386 --> 00:53:32.443
What? That stupid vase?

778
00:53:32.653 --> 00:53:34.642
It wasn't supposed to be a vase.

779
00:53:34.853 --> 00:53:38.216
It was supposed to be worth
something more than jewels.


780
00:53:38.887 --> 00:53:41.717
Something a little girl's dreams
are made of.


781
00:53:42.119 --> 00:53:44.950
I knew a little girl like that once.

782
00:53:46.286 --> 00:53:48.184
You don't know anything. Get out.

783
00:53:48.386 --> 00:53:51.250
She was a very sweet girl
but the world broke her heart.


784
00:53:51.453 --> 00:53:53.146
She wasn't after any vase.

785
00:53:53.353 --> 00:53:56.114
She was looking for a hero.
Weren't you, little girl?


786
00:53:56.319 --> 00:53:58.342
You were looking for a hero
and his armor.


787
00:53:58.553 --> 00:54:00.849
The only man who would know that
is dead.


788
00:54:01.052 --> 00:54:03.610
The Fleece. The Golden Fleece.

789
00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.080
Jason's Golden Fleece.

790
00:54:05.286 --> 00:54:08.411
He's dead.
You're dead. You're dead.


791
00:54:25.453 --> 00:54:27.510
-Will you look at that?
-Don't that beat all?


792
00:54:27.952 --> 00:54:28.975
Hey, it's The Spirit.

793
00:54:29.386 --> 00:54:31.852
-He's street pizza.
-He looks stupid.


794
00:54:32.052 --> 00:54:35.075
-Wanker.
-You'll believe a man can't fly.


795
00:54:35.286 --> 00:54:36.650
Jump already.

796
00:54:36.853 --> 00:54:38.512
Jump, jump, jump

797
00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:40.515
Jump, jump, jump

798
00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:51.315
Get me the hell out of here.

799
00:55:02.186 --> 00:55:03.777
Not right now. 
I'm kind of busy.

800
00:55:03.986 --> 00:55:06.179
It's Morgenstern.
I might have a lead for you.


801
00:55:06.386 --> 00:55:08.318
Nobody noticed all of that salt.

802
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.850
It was right under our noses.

803
00:55:10.052 --> 00:55:13.143
-Could you pick up the pace?
-Salt. Industrial salt.


804
00:55:13.353 --> 00:55:16.217
One of The Octopus' henchmen,
we found him dead near the flats.


805
00:55:16.419 --> 00:55:17.851
Remember where Sussman got shot?

806
00:55:18.052 --> 00:55:21.314
Industrial salt,
it was caked all over his shoes.


807
00:55:21.520 --> 00:55:23.816
Dolan was right.
you'll make detective in no time.


808
00:55:24.019 --> 00:55:25.349
Thank you, sir.

809
00:55:25.753 --> 00:55:27.480
I gotta go.

810
00:56:02.486 --> 00:56:03.713
I'll buy you a drink.

811
00:56:03.919 --> 00:56:06.477
All right, folks, show's over.
Time to move on.


812
00:56:06.686 --> 00:56:09.947
Yeah, well, Sand,
that went great, didn't it?


813
00:56:10.152 --> 00:56:13.744
Reunions between old sweethearts
will have to wait.


814
00:56:13.952 --> 00:56:17.043
I got bigger fish to fry.
I'm coming after you, Octopus...


815
00:56:17.253 --> 00:56:20.617
...but before I kill you, you're gonna
answer me some questions.


816
00:56:29.286 --> 00:56:33.719
Morgenstern said there was salt on
his shoes. There's plenty of it here.


817
00:56:35.553 --> 00:56:38.314
Plenty of bad guys too.

818
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:40.679
All the enemy has
is guns and knives.


819
00:56:41.986 --> 00:56:45.043
I have an entire city as my weapon.

820
00:56:50.286 --> 00:56:51.582
My arsenal:

821
00:56:51.785 --> 00:56:54.274
Iron-jawed fire escapes.

822
00:56:54.819 --> 00:56:56.342
Man-made lightning.

823
00:56:58.119 --> 00:56:59.517
Unforgiving pavement.

824
00:57:20.019 --> 00:57:22.076
She provides for me.

825
00:57:23.386 --> 00:57:24.817
She protects me.

826
00:57:27.653 --> 00:57:30.414
She is my mother, my city is.

827
00:57:32.486 --> 00:57:33.815
She's a good mother.

828
00:57:36.553 --> 00:57:38.610
She always shows me the way.

829
00:57:47.052 --> 00:57:49.610
What a fine detective.

830
00:57:49.819 --> 00:57:53.308
You followed the breadcrumbs
right to us.


831
00:58:02.186 --> 00:58:04.845
You're not doing anybody good
by falling asleep on the job.


832
00:58:05.052 --> 00:58:08.075
So why don't you go home,
get yourself some proper rest?


833
00:58:08.286 --> 00:58:10.445
You look like something
that the cat dragged in.


834
00:58:10.653 --> 00:58:12.619
So sweet of you to come by, Daddy.

835
00:58:12.819 --> 00:58:16.479
I was just checking in on Sussman.
They wouldn't let me see him. Twits.


836
00:58:16.686 --> 00:58:19.981
Sussman's still in critical,
they're trying to save his spine.


837
00:58:20.186 --> 00:58:23.448
Yeah? What's the odds
of him walking again?


838
00:58:23.653 --> 00:58:25.118
Hard to tell.

839
00:58:25.319 --> 00:58:26.750
Miracles do happen.

840
00:58:28.852 --> 00:58:30.580
Damn Spirit.

841
00:58:30.785 --> 00:58:32.808
-He's over the edge.
-Don't go there, Daddy.


842
00:58:33.019 --> 00:58:35.746
-He's a goddamn menace.
-He's something the world needs.


843
00:58:35.952 --> 00:58:37.145
He's a hero.

844
00:58:37.353 --> 00:58:40.114
He's a goddamn menace and my
own daughter's in love with him.


845
00:58:40.319 --> 00:58:42.444
He's why you're killing yourself,
waiting up.


846
00:58:42.653 --> 00:58:45.448
Yes. He's why I'm still here tonight.

847
00:58:45.653 --> 00:58:48.141
Yeah. Just in case
they wheel him in here...


848
00:58:48.353 --> 00:58:50.512
-...one more goddamn time.
-Just in case.


849
00:58:50.719 --> 00:58:53.311
So you can lose your youth
stapling his parts back?


850
00:58:53.719 --> 00:58:57.152
I'm not a child.
And I rarely use staples on anybody.


851
00:58:57.752 --> 00:59:01.150
-Can't you see what you're doing?
-I know exactly what I'm doing.


852
00:59:01.353 --> 00:59:03.251
I'm giving him exactly what he needs.

853
00:59:03.453 --> 00:59:05.714
-He's using you.
-He needs me.


854
00:59:05.919 --> 00:59:09.010
I'm the only one who knows his body.

855
00:59:09.219 --> 00:59:10.878
How to treat him.

856
00:59:12.752 --> 00:59:16.207
Plenty of dames who know all about
his body, from what I hear.


857
00:59:16.419 --> 00:59:17.510
That's not what I meant.

858
00:59:17.719 --> 00:59:20.742
Plenty of broads he's stretched across
a gurney or what have you...


859
00:59:20.952 --> 00:59:22.213
...knowing just what to say.

860
00:59:22.419 --> 00:59:24.476
So this is why you came here tonight.

861
00:59:24.685 --> 00:59:26.742
Melting them like butter
with his fingers--


862
00:59:26.952 --> 00:59:28.213
That's enough.

863
00:59:28.852 --> 00:59:31.216
Don't make me ask you to leave.

864
00:59:33.152 --> 00:59:36.141
Honey, I don't know
how to talk about this stuff.


865
00:59:37.219 --> 00:59:39.378
You surely don't.

866
00:59:39.819 --> 00:59:44.184
Why do you think I spend my nights
knocking around that house all alone?


867
00:59:44.819 --> 00:59:47.081
Guess she had her reasons.

868
00:59:51.619 --> 00:59:54.017
You're married to your job.

869
00:59:54.419 --> 00:59:55.407
So am l.

870
00:59:56.486 --> 00:59:58.179
So is he.

871
01:00:01.219 --> 01:00:04.651
You were so much happier
in the old days with Denny.


872
01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:07.784
Denny's dead.

873
01:00:09.386 --> 01:00:10.409
Yeah.

874
01:00:12.019 --> 01:00:13.644
Yeah, Denny Colt is dead.

875
01:00:13.852 --> 01:00:16.716
-Sweet kid.
-Yes, he was.


876
01:00:17.019 --> 01:00:19.951
And I'll never forget him
but we keep going.


877
01:00:22.253 --> 01:00:24.446
I lost my Boy Scout.

878
01:00:26.919 --> 01:00:29.749
Yeah. Yeah...

879
01:00:30.386 --> 01:00:32.681
...and I lost my little prom queen, huh?

880
01:00:34.486 --> 01:00:37.145
-Good night, sweetheart.
-Good night, Daddy.


881
01:00:37.353 --> 01:00:39.944
I just hope that son of a bitch
knows how lucky he is.


882
01:00:41.019 --> 01:00:42.644
He doesn't.

883
01:00:52.286 --> 01:00:54.445
I can feel you.

884
01:00:54.652 --> 01:00:56.709
You're so weary.

885
01:00:56.919 --> 01:01:01.409
Let me hold you.

886
01:01:04.785 --> 01:01:06.479
What smells dental?

887
01:01:11.019 --> 01:01:13.349
Dental and Nazi.

888
01:01:13.552 --> 01:01:14.779
Great.

889
01:01:16.585 --> 01:01:18.279
Oh, no.

890
01:01:22.486 --> 01:01:24.610
Oh, brother.

891
01:01:30.819 --> 01:01:34.979
I've known some pretty strange women
in my time, some darn strange women.


892
01:01:35.186 --> 01:01:36.549
But this one...

893
01:01:36.752 --> 01:01:40.480
...if she is who I think she is,
she's got the final word on strange.


894
01:01:54.719 --> 01:01:58.015
I am Plaster. Plaster of Paris.

895
01:02:14.952 --> 01:02:16.781
I will stick to my man.

896
01:02:21.152 --> 01:02:23.709
Till death do us part.

897
01:02:29.852 --> 01:02:31.443
Death.

898
01:02:33.419 --> 01:02:35.976
Death. Death, death.

899
01:02:37.685 --> 01:02:40.674
It's just about all we think about,
isn't it?


900
01:02:41.086 --> 01:02:42.551
We eat...

901
01:02:42.752 --> 01:02:43.979
...so we won't die.

902
01:02:44.186 --> 01:02:47.709
We mate so that
our seed will live on.


903
01:02:47.919 --> 01:02:50.385
Create art and build skyscrapers...

904
01:02:50.585 --> 01:02:54.279
...so that our names
will be remembered for centuries.


905
01:03:02.785 --> 01:03:06.478
Mr. Long, my good friend,
how are you?


906
01:03:06.685 --> 01:03:08.674
What can I do for you?

907
01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:09.977
A message?

908
01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:12.549
And from whom would that be?

909
01:03:13.652 --> 01:03:16.982
Sand Saref. Oh, yes, I know her.

910
01:03:17.253 --> 01:03:20.219
Well, you should've known better
than to play cards with her.


911
01:03:20.418 --> 01:03:22.509
And what would her message be?

912
01:03:22.886 --> 01:03:24.681
The projects?

913
01:03:25.019 --> 01:03:26.814
Out off that old main drag, oh.

914
01:03:27.019 --> 01:03:29.450
Hell, yeah, I know it.

915
01:03:29.652 --> 01:03:30.709
Tomorrow night, then.

916
01:03:31.219 --> 01:03:32.878
Let's say...

917
01:03:33.086 --> 01:03:34.949
...after dinner.

918
01:03:35.719 --> 01:03:38.049
Zai jian, my honored friend.

919
01:03:40.986 --> 01:03:42.952
-Where was l?
-Death.


920
01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.243
Death, yes.

921
01:03:46.186 --> 01:03:48.311
We live our short...

922
01:03:48.519 --> 01:03:51.644
...frantic, fearful lives,
twisting this way and that.


923
01:03:52.852 --> 01:03:54.613
Music and ambition.

924
01:03:54.819 --> 01:03:58.808
Making up gods, afterlives,
all to keep our eyes off...


925
01:03:59.019 --> 01:04:02.678
...that immovable, impassable,
diamond-hard retaining wall...


926
01:04:02.886 --> 01:04:07.716
...that is death,
realizing it will splatter our brains...


927
01:04:08.052 --> 01:04:09.279
...Iike eggs.

928
01:04:09.485 --> 01:04:11.644
Pardon me,
but is there a point to all this?


929
01:04:11.852 --> 01:04:14.545
Because I'm getting old
just listening to you.


930
01:04:15.253 --> 01:04:17.810
Man, you are really thick.

931
01:04:18.119 --> 01:04:21.551
You just don't get it.

932
01:04:21.752 --> 01:04:24.650
We're two of a kind, you and me.

933
01:04:25.219 --> 01:04:26.878
Ain't neither one of us getting old.

934
01:04:27.086 --> 01:04:29.881
Well, I sure as heck can get bored.

935
01:04:31.886 --> 01:04:34.977
You keep teasing about
how we're two of a kind.


936
01:04:35.186 --> 01:04:37.175
So how's that?

937
01:04:37.652 --> 01:04:39.481
What are we, Octopus?

938
01:04:39.685 --> 01:04:41.446
I'm getting to that.

939
01:04:41.652 --> 01:04:42.879
Well, move it along.

940
01:04:43.086 --> 01:04:45.608
Do you remember your death,
pretty boy?


941
01:04:45.819 --> 01:04:47.717
Not the sort of thing a guy forgets.

942
01:04:55.452 --> 01:04:56.748
Yeah, I remember.

943
01:05:01.552 --> 01:05:07.348
When they wheeled you in,
you were stone-cold dead.


944
01:05:07.552 --> 01:05:10.075
Not a breath of life in you.

945
01:05:11.285 --> 01:05:13.252
You were perfect.

946
01:05:14.086 --> 01:05:17.109
Dead as Star Trek.

947
01:05:17.318 --> 01:05:20.751
And I was your coroner.

948
01:05:20.952 --> 01:05:25.816
But I was, oh, so much, much
more than that.


949
01:05:26.019 --> 01:05:27.746
I'd built up a righteous drug trade.

950
01:05:27.952 --> 01:05:30.417
It's amazing how much a hospital
doesn't miss.


951
01:05:30.619 --> 01:05:34.211
All you have to do is water it down,
spruce it up and achtung.


952
01:05:34.418 --> 01:05:35.406
Swiss bank accounts.

953
01:05:35.819 --> 01:05:38.376
But mere money was never
what The Octopus was after.


954
01:05:39.186 --> 01:05:42.379
All right, so I give up.
What were you after?


955
01:05:43.385 --> 01:05:46.045
Immortality.

956
01:05:46.252 --> 01:05:49.083
All five sweet syllables of it.

957
01:05:49.285 --> 01:05:51.683
There had to be a better way
to keep someone alive...


958
01:05:51.886 --> 01:05:54.750
...other than cutting them open
like some free-range chicken.


959
01:05:54.952 --> 01:05:58.009
Free-range chickens with their big,
brown, ugly-ass eggs.


960
01:05:58.219 --> 01:05:59.207
They piss me off.

961
01:05:59.418 --> 01:06:03.612
Every time I think about those big,
brown eggs, they piss me off.


962
01:06:03.819 --> 01:06:06.341
Or pills.
They're just another way to stall death.


963
01:06:06.552 --> 01:06:08.575
Cling on for a heartbeat.
Hardly the answer.


964
01:06:08.785 --> 01:06:10.751
-I got down to basics.
-The essence of life.


965
01:06:10.952 --> 01:06:12.111
-I cracked code.
-Genetics.


966
01:06:12.318 --> 01:06:15.751
-That's how smart I am.
-Yeah, you're a real smart fella.


967
01:06:15.952 --> 01:06:18.145
Thank you. But it wasn't that easy.

968
01:06:18.352 --> 01:06:20.944
And I've got a freezer
full of stray beagles to prove it.


969
01:06:21.152 --> 01:06:24.845
Oh, what that serum did
to those poor dogs...


970
01:06:25.052 --> 01:06:26.779
...was just plain wrong.

971
01:06:27.819 --> 01:06:30.410
But when I got it right,
well, I had to try it out.


972
01:06:30.619 --> 01:06:33.915
I wasn't about to try it on myself.
I might've come out looking funny.


973
01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:35.812
I needed a human.

974
01:06:36.019 --> 01:06:37.575
And there I was.

975
01:06:37.785 --> 01:06:39.546
And there you was.

976
01:06:39.752 --> 01:06:42.809
I gave you a modest injection
and I waited.


977
01:06:56.752 --> 01:06:59.547
Your second life
began that very night.


978
01:06:59.752 --> 01:07:01.082
Do you remember?

979
01:07:06.119 --> 01:07:07.880
Oh, yeah, I remember.

980
01:07:10.719 --> 01:07:12.776
Somewhere in the midst
of all that praying...


981
01:07:12.986 --> 01:07:14.542
...and whimpering and sniveling...

982
01:07:14.752 --> 01:07:17.616
...you must have found
something sharp.


983
01:07:32.519 --> 01:07:34.678
You know, I always wanted to ask:

984
01:07:34.886 --> 01:07:36.875
Where did you go when you got out?

985
01:07:38.252 --> 01:07:40.582
I took a walk.

986
01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:47.250
I had myself a think.

987
01:07:49.685 --> 01:07:51.446
I visited an old friend.

988
01:07:51.652 --> 01:07:55.641
I don't know what happened,
but I still move, I still breathe.


989
01:07:55.852 --> 01:07:58.283
It's impossible, but I'm still alive.

990
01:07:59.086 --> 01:08:01.244
All my life, all I wanted to be
was a good cop.


991
01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:03.281
That's all changed.
Everything's changed.


992
01:08:03.485 --> 01:08:06.077
They're winning, sir.
The bad guys are winning.


993
01:08:06.285 --> 01:08:09.274
I think I've got something more
to fight back with now.


994
01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:12.344
I'm something else now.

995
01:08:12.552 --> 01:08:15.143
I can go places, I can do things
they won't let cops do.


996
01:08:15.352 --> 01:08:18.910
But I can't have any weaknesses.
No name. No friends.


997
01:08:19.118 --> 01:08:21.107
I have to stay dead
in everybody's eyes.


998
01:08:21.785 --> 01:08:23.478
Even Ellen's.

999
01:08:24.019 --> 01:08:25.575
But I could be your spy.

1000
01:08:26.086 --> 01:08:28.244
I could work with your men.

1001
01:08:28.452 --> 01:08:31.316
Behind them, in the shadows.

1002
01:08:31.519 --> 01:08:35.451
I could be
the city's protector, its-- lts--


1003
01:08:36.385 --> 01:08:37.908
Its spirit.

1004
01:08:39.151 --> 01:08:41.947
Exit hero cop, enter The Spirit.

1005
01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:45.249
Pain in the ass. 
Tough as nails.

1006
01:08:45.452 --> 01:08:48.475
Eureka!

1007
01:08:49.085 --> 01:08:53.245
So I shot myself up, and we became
brothers under the skin.


1008
01:08:53.452 --> 01:08:56.646
So, what the hell are we, Octopus?

1009
01:08:57.185 --> 01:08:59.049
You're works in progress.

1010
01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:01.943
And once he has the vase
and its contents...


1011
01:09:02.151 --> 01:09:05.413
...its mystic contents,
lost over millennia...


1012
01:09:05.619 --> 01:09:07.983
...he'll drink of it
and he'll become immortal.


1013
01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:10.083
Don't tease.

1014
01:09:10.285 --> 01:09:13.115
Seeing as how I'm gonna die anyway,
clue me in.


1015
01:09:13.318 --> 01:09:14.978
What's in the vase?

1016
01:09:15.185 --> 01:09:17.549
-Thor's hammer?
-No.


1017
01:09:17.986 --> 01:09:19.281
Better.

1018
01:09:19.485 --> 01:09:21.610
The DNA...

1019
01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:24.842
-...of a god.
-Not a god. Not exactly.


1020
01:09:25.051 --> 01:09:28.950
Yeah, because, you know, humans
and gods, well, they don't mix very well.


1021
01:09:29.151 --> 01:09:33.379
The only route to take is to find the
connection between man and god...


1022
01:09:33.585 --> 01:09:35.710
...the child of an immortal
and a human.


1023
01:09:35.919 --> 01:09:39.851
See, Zeus couldn't keep it in his pants,
so he made bags and bags of heroes.


1024
01:09:40.051 --> 01:09:42.381
Now, the greatest of them all
was Heracles.


1025
01:09:42.585 --> 01:09:44.710
And we found his ass.

1026
01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:47.441
Well, his blood anyway.
He left some blood around.


1027
01:09:47.652 --> 01:09:48.948
And we know where it is.

1028
01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:53.777
So that's the missing link
between science and magic.


1029
01:09:53.986 --> 01:09:58.281
Now, once Heracles' blood mixes
with Octopus' formula....


1030
01:09:58.485 --> 01:10:01.576
-I become a god.
-Or the next best thing.


1031
01:10:01.785 --> 01:10:03.614
I become a god.

1032
01:10:03.819 --> 01:10:06.808
And you'll be just one more
sad little byproduct.


1033
01:10:07.318 --> 01:10:09.250
One of his many, many, many failures.

1034
01:10:09.619 --> 01:10:12.084
Come on, now.
Rome wasn't built in a day.


1035
01:10:12.819 --> 01:10:16.444
Besides, look at all the lovely buddies
I've made along the way.


1036
01:10:16.652 --> 01:10:17.640
We was easy to make.

1037
01:10:17.852 --> 01:10:19.681
Yeah, the boss says
we was easy to make.


1038
01:10:19.886 --> 01:10:21.943
But your failures were several.

1039
01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:24.447
And unpleasant.

1040
01:10:24.985 --> 01:10:27.952
Yeah, you know,
you get so much as one little drop...


1041
01:10:28.151 --> 01:10:30.617
...the wrong temperature,
and everything just--


1042
01:10:31.185 --> 01:10:32.776
Let me show you.

1043
01:10:33.252 --> 01:10:34.979
It's kind of sad...

1044
01:10:35.185 --> 01:10:37.583
...but it's really kind of cool too.

1045
01:10:37.785 --> 01:10:39.045
This is Muffin.

1046
01:10:40.318 --> 01:10:42.147
She's my favorite.

1047
01:11:10.819 --> 01:11:12.546
We have to have people over
more often.


1048
01:11:12.752 --> 01:11:14.274
I like this.

1049
01:11:18.485 --> 01:11:20.508
The cat.

1050
01:11:23.118 --> 01:11:26.016
She is all the reason I need.

1051
01:11:26.352 --> 01:11:27.648
I will kill you.

1052
01:11:28.918 --> 01:11:32.282
-Oh, no, you have to die, Spirit.
-Yeah, because you got the juice, man.


1053
01:11:32.485 --> 01:11:35.917
Your system's been prepared.
You're the only one the blood won't kill.


1054
01:11:36.118 --> 01:11:38.482
One sip and you could be rendered
as immortal as he.


1055
01:11:38.685 --> 01:11:40.275
The Octopus can be the only one.

1056
01:11:40.485 --> 01:11:42.849
There can be no competition
once he's world ruler.


1057
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:45.279
Yes, then everyone
will have to do what I say.


1058
01:11:45.485 --> 01:11:50.917
They will all have to do what I say
because I will be the ruler of the world.


1059
01:11:51.118 --> 01:11:53.380
Then everything
will start to make sense.


1060
01:11:53.585 --> 01:11:55.551
Yes, everything will make sense.

1061
01:11:55.752 --> 01:11:58.217
Everything will start to make sense.

1062
01:11:59.285 --> 01:12:00.978
Let's get back to business.

1063
01:12:01.185 --> 01:12:02.549
Yes, back to business.

1064
01:12:03.685 --> 01:12:05.241
Back to killing your ass.

1065
01:12:06.318 --> 01:12:09.113
Now, here's where things
become a little tricky.


1066
01:12:09.318 --> 01:12:11.079
It's all about integration.

1067
01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:13.910
Now, in your current state,
you heal very quickly.


1068
01:12:14.118 --> 01:12:16.107
Your wounds mend in moments.

1069
01:12:16.318 --> 01:12:20.580
The only solution, it turns out, is to
affect your systemic disintegration.


1070
01:12:20.785 --> 01:12:22.683
In short...

1071
01:12:24.485 --> 01:12:28.042
...to render you into
so many different parts spread so far...


1072
01:12:28.252 --> 01:12:30.911
...that reintegration
would be impossible.


1073
01:12:32.552 --> 01:12:34.609
And being the man that I am...

1074
01:12:34.819 --> 01:12:39.080
...I like to start from the bottom
and work my way up.


1075
01:12:39.285 --> 01:12:42.217
Floss, bring me those bags.

1076
01:12:47.252 --> 01:12:50.309
I'm going to mail your ass
all over the country.


1077
01:12:51.519 --> 01:12:53.075
Plaster...

1078
01:12:53.285 --> 01:12:54.444
...bring me his toes.

1079
01:12:58.352 --> 01:12:59.750
Plaster.

1080
01:13:13.851 --> 01:13:15.249
Enough of this frog talk.

1081
01:13:15.452 --> 01:13:16.611
I don't understand it.

1082
01:13:17.918 --> 01:13:19.282
Paris...

1083
01:13:19.485 --> 01:13:21.542
...give me his toes.

1084
01:13:21.752 --> 01:13:24.240
That's an order.

1085
01:13:28.519 --> 01:13:29.712
I hate you.

1086
01:13:37.652 --> 01:13:38.947
This is for Sand.

1087
01:13:40.452 --> 01:13:41.611
This is for me.

1088
01:13:41.818 --> 01:13:44.410
And this one's for Muffin.

1089
01:13:52.418 --> 01:13:54.213
That all you got?

1090
01:14:01.418 --> 01:14:02.974
Who is this Sand?

1091
01:14:04.352 --> 01:14:06.716
Not now. Let's go.

1092
01:14:29.118 --> 01:14:30.845
The Spirit.

1093
01:14:31.318 --> 01:14:32.977
Plaster.

1094
01:14:45.085 --> 01:14:47.983
And this is for Sand.

1095
01:14:52.951 --> 01:14:56.315
I am Plaster of Paris.

1096
01:14:56.918 --> 01:14:59.850
The toast of Montmartre.

1097
01:15:00.918 --> 01:15:02.975
I will stick to my man.

1098
01:15:03.185 --> 01:15:05.447
Till death do us part.

1099
01:15:10.718 --> 01:15:13.082
You're close now.

1100
01:15:13.485 --> 01:15:16.576
Very, very close.

1101
01:15:24.519 --> 01:15:26.950
You can't fight me.

1102
01:15:27.151 --> 01:15:29.776
You. You are mine. Mine. Mine.

1103
01:15:48.485 --> 01:15:50.314
Hey, man, I know the feeling.

1104
01:15:50.519 --> 01:15:52.950
You should meet my wife.

1105
01:15:54.818 --> 01:15:58.410
Just put one foot
in front of the other.

1106
01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:33.145
Here we go again.

1107
01:16:34.018 --> 01:16:36.416
I'm dead again.

1108
01:16:39.051 --> 01:16:41.642
The fight's gone out of me.

1109
01:16:44.851 --> 01:16:46.714
I'm ready for you, Lorelei.

1110
01:16:46.918 --> 01:16:48.441
Come.

1111
01:16:48.651 --> 01:16:51.243
Come. Come. Come.

1112
01:16:51.452 --> 01:16:52.849
Come.

1113
01:16:53.051 --> 01:16:55.210
It is time.

1114
01:16:55.485 --> 01:16:57.542
Come. Come.

1115
01:16:58.218 --> 01:17:00.581
No more pain.

1116
01:17:00.985 --> 01:17:03.383
No more suffering.

1117
01:17:05.018 --> 01:17:07.677
Give up the last of it, Denny.

1118
01:17:10.018 --> 01:17:12.416
Give up the ghost.

1119
01:17:13.552 --> 01:17:15.211
Give up the spirit.

1120
01:17:15.584 --> 01:17:17.641
Yes, my darling. Yes.

1121
01:17:38.352 --> 01:17:39.783
No.

1122
01:17:41.651 --> 01:17:43.049
It is done.

1123
01:17:43.252 --> 01:17:45.843
It is done. It is done.

1124
01:17:46.051 --> 01:17:48.017
What's it they say about
when you die...


1125
01:17:48.218 --> 01:17:50.615
...about your whole life
flashing before your eyes?


1126
01:17:50.818 --> 01:17:52.079
Forget all that.

1127
01:17:52.285 --> 01:17:53.773
All I see are women.

1128
01:17:53.985 --> 01:17:58.815
My sweet Ellen, always there to put
my ragged pieces back together.


1129
01:17:59.018 --> 01:18:00.984
And Sand.

1130
01:18:01.618 --> 01:18:03.380
That poor lost soul.

1131
01:18:05.551 --> 01:18:08.949
Beautiful, beautiful Sand.

1132
01:18:17.951 --> 01:18:21.815
It's so funny my last thought
would be of Sand.


1133
01:18:30.452 --> 01:18:32.213
No.

1134
01:18:32.418 --> 01:18:34.679
Lorelei, you're not for me just yet.

1135
01:18:34.885 --> 01:18:37.147
No, not again.

1136
01:18:37.352 --> 01:18:39.681
They need me. I gotta go back.

1137
01:18:39.885 --> 01:18:42.680
I will always be with you, Denny Colt.

1138
01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.874
You won't escape me forever.

1139
01:18:46.352 --> 01:18:48.544
They need me.

1140
01:19:19.085 --> 01:19:20.914
Sand...

1141
01:19:21.252 --> 01:19:22.774
...at the projects.

1142
01:19:24.484 --> 01:19:26.746
Octopus.

1143
01:19:27.985 --> 01:19:30.178
Pieces.

1144
01:19:31.484 --> 01:19:33.814
Pieces of Sand.

1145
01:19:36.951 --> 01:19:38.416
Pieces.

1146
01:19:38.618 --> 01:19:40.380
Pieces of Octopus.

1147
01:19:40.584 --> 01:19:42.413
You son of a bitch, Octopus.
You're mine.


1148
01:19:42.618 --> 01:19:43.811
Always with The Octopus.

1149
01:19:44.018 --> 01:19:46.449
-Excuse me, but wasn't he, like--?
-Not right now.


1150
01:19:46.651 --> 01:19:49.549
But three hours with no vitals.
Shouldn't he ought to be dead?


1151
01:19:49.751 --> 01:19:50.944
It's a long story.

1152
01:19:51.151 --> 01:19:53.844
Somebody get me a tie.
And it sure as hell better be red.


1153
01:19:54.051 --> 01:19:56.448
-This time, you better know your place.
-Hold on.


1154
01:19:56.651 --> 01:19:58.947
You're supposed to be my spy,
not some vigilante.


1155
01:19:59.151 --> 01:20:02.412
If you go all cowboy on me again,
I am gonna blast you in half myself.


1156
01:20:02.618 --> 01:20:04.607
-You got that?
-I got an idea.


1157
01:20:04.951 --> 01:20:07.849
-I'm atwitter.
-No, it's good.


1158
01:20:08.051 --> 01:20:09.278
I promise.

1159
01:20:15.051 --> 01:20:18.813
Hey, you keep that thing pointed
at The Octopus.


1160
01:20:19.018 --> 01:20:21.211
When I give you the word,
you blow his head off.


1161
01:20:21.417 --> 01:20:24.111
Then it's on with our wedding night,
huh, baby?


1162
01:20:24.318 --> 01:20:27.045
Yeah, baby. Our wedding night.

1163
01:21:20.085 --> 01:21:21.812
Who the hell are you?

1164
01:21:22.018 --> 01:21:25.246
-You The Octopus' girlfriend?
-Oh, no, it's not like that.


1165
01:21:26.285 --> 01:21:28.046
-I mean, this is fun for me.
-Fun?


1166
01:21:28.252 --> 01:21:30.774
We show up here,
we look fabulous doing it...


1167
01:21:30.985 --> 01:21:32.610
...we swap things, then we leave.

1168
01:21:32.818 --> 01:21:36.012
-You're looking to get yourself killed.
-Would you lighten up?


1169
01:21:36.218 --> 01:21:37.945
-Should we start shooting?
-Don't know.


1170
01:21:38.151 --> 01:21:40.117
-No shooting.
-No shooting, you polyp.


1171
01:21:40.518 --> 01:21:42.677
No sign of The Octopus.

1172
01:21:42.885 --> 01:21:45.544
Hell of a waste of time
if he didn't show up.


1173
01:21:45.751 --> 01:21:50.241
Whenever he does, sir,
we are locked and loaded.


1174
01:21:50.451 --> 01:21:52.417
That cannon could take out the moon,
rookie.


1175
01:21:52.718 --> 01:21:54.014
Sir, I'm an excellent shot.

1176
01:21:54.218 --> 01:21:56.479
Is every goddamn woman
in this goddamn hellhole...


1177
01:21:56.684 --> 01:22:00.377
-...out of her goddamn mind?
-No, sir, we're just equipped.


1178
01:22:00.584 --> 01:22:02.447
Sweetie, he's just using you.

1179
01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:06.947
Sure he is. I run a very lucrative
operation and I'm great eye candy.


1180
01:22:07.151 --> 01:22:09.582
I walk away,
I have my Ph.D. all paid for.


1181
01:22:09.784 --> 01:22:12.148
Fine. Tell lug nuts over there
to give me the box.


1182
01:22:12.351 --> 01:22:14.817
And you, you start that walking.

1183
01:22:15.018 --> 01:22:17.643
As far away from that animal
as you possibly can.


1184
01:22:17.851 --> 01:22:21.215
He will kill you. 
He kills everything.

1185
01:22:21.651 --> 01:22:26.141
All right, fine. I just think you're taking
this way too seriously, that's all.


1186
01:23:05.684 --> 01:23:07.616
Give them the vase.

1187
01:23:15.918 --> 01:23:17.781
Boss said I start shooting now.

1188
01:23:22.484 --> 01:23:24.144
Get in the truck.

1189
01:23:27.851 --> 01:23:29.441
Nobody goes anywhere.

1190
01:23:30.851 --> 01:23:32.147
Floss...

1191
01:23:32.351 --> 01:23:34.011
...fetch me that vase, please.

1192
01:23:34.217 --> 01:23:35.240
Get in the truck.

1193
01:23:35.684 --> 01:23:39.309
Give me the blood of Heracles, now.

1194
01:23:39.518 --> 01:23:40.779
Walk.

1195
01:23:40.985 --> 01:23:42.042
Heracles?

1196
01:23:44.451 --> 01:23:46.781
I always thought it was "Hercules."

1197
01:23:48.051 --> 01:23:49.676
You.

1198
01:24:10.085 --> 01:24:13.209
Sand, you found your armor.

1199
01:24:13.417 --> 01:24:14.713
Use it.

1200
01:24:14.918 --> 01:24:16.281
What is it with you and women?

1201
01:24:20.150 --> 01:24:21.980
Octopus...

1202
01:24:22.184 --> 01:24:23.946
...you were right.

1203
01:24:24.150 --> 01:24:25.741
We're mistakes.

1204
01:24:25.951 --> 01:24:27.541
We never should have happened.

1205
01:24:39.851 --> 01:24:41.817
-Sir, this is crazy.
-Hold your horses.


1206
01:24:42.018 --> 01:24:44.313
He doesn't want any cops
getting killed.


1207
01:24:48.551 --> 01:24:51.142
You're not making this easy.

1208
01:24:58.518 --> 01:24:59.643
Come on, kid.

1209
01:25:09.684 --> 01:25:11.411
It ends tonight.

1210
01:25:12.985 --> 01:25:14.245
You got that right.

1211
01:25:14.718 --> 01:25:16.377
I'm The Octopus.

1212
01:25:16.584 --> 01:25:17.948
I got eight of everything.

1213
01:25:40.618 --> 01:25:42.709
There's shot to hell.

1214
01:25:42.918 --> 01:25:44.543
And shot to hell.

1215
01:25:45.284 --> 01:25:48.079
And there's just plain ridiculous.

1216
01:25:48.551 --> 01:25:50.346
Now.

1217
01:26:10.518 --> 01:26:12.074
You idiot, Octopus.

1218
01:26:12.284 --> 01:26:15.773
All we needed was to flush you
and your gunsels out.


1219
01:26:19.818 --> 01:26:21.477
Move, move.

1220
01:26:27.017 --> 01:26:28.415
Give it to him, boys.

1221
01:27:29.484 --> 01:27:31.313
Commissioner Dolan,
your daughter's here.


1222
01:27:32.984 --> 01:27:34.245
We need more men over there.

1223
01:27:34.451 --> 01:27:37.212
-Baby, you don't wanna be here.
-You're joking, right, Daddy?


1224
01:27:37.417 --> 01:27:40.144
Have you forgotten what I do
for a living? He might need me.


1225
01:27:40.351 --> 01:27:42.579
You'll be in his way,
he doesn't want you here.


1226
01:27:42.784 --> 01:27:43.942
You don't know that.

1227
01:27:44.150 --> 01:27:47.446
You don't know him.
You don't know a damn thing.


1228
01:27:47.651 --> 01:27:49.412
Stop her. Pull her back.

1229
01:27:49.784 --> 01:27:50.875
Yes, sir.

1230
01:27:56.618 --> 01:27:58.447
Runny eggs.

1231
01:28:10.684 --> 01:28:13.172
Finally. Yes.

1232
01:28:13.384 --> 01:28:14.407
Yes.

1233
01:28:14.618 --> 01:28:18.345
Yeah!

1234
01:28:27.684 --> 01:28:29.047
Wha--?

1235
01:28:34.751 --> 01:28:36.774
Nice investment, Sand.

1236
01:28:36.984 --> 01:28:38.575
Passes its first field test.

1237
01:28:46.150 --> 01:28:47.377
Let's die.

1238
01:28:57.751 --> 01:28:59.875
Oh, God. Oh, God, no.

1239
01:29:00.751 --> 01:29:02.239
No. Oh, God.

1240
01:29:04.417 --> 01:29:05.747
Mother.

1241
01:29:33.117 --> 01:29:35.606
I guess it's time
to finally drop your armor, Sand.


1242
01:29:40.050 --> 01:29:42.141
You lost something.

1243
01:29:45.917 --> 01:29:48.315
Old man Kurtzman said
he'd take it back.


1244
01:29:53.784 --> 01:29:55.215
Well...

1245
01:29:56.217 --> 01:29:58.240
...maybe I'll wear it now and then.

1246
01:29:58.451 --> 01:30:00.713
But it doesn't mean I'm your girl.

1247
01:30:39.351 --> 01:30:42.112
Ellen. Ellen, are you all right?

1248
01:31:12.317 --> 01:31:13.544
Goodbye, Sand.

1249
01:31:15.017 --> 01:31:16.778
Goodbye, Denny.

1250
01:31:40.884 --> 01:31:42.680
Goodbye, Spirit.

1251
01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:48.149
-ls that Saref?
-Give me this one, Dolan.


1252
01:31:48.351 --> 01:31:49.578
Just let her go.

1253
01:31:49.783 --> 01:31:52.477
She saved me.
She saved the world.


1254
01:31:52.683 --> 01:31:55.843
Yeah, well,
you had something to do with it.


1255
01:31:56.050 --> 01:31:58.516
All right. All right.
Just stay out of my face.


1256
01:32:04.351 --> 01:32:06.942
So who the hell was that back there?
Who is she?


1257
01:32:07.150 --> 01:32:08.411
Just an old flame.

1258
01:32:08.618 --> 01:32:10.584
Yeah, she looks old.

1259
01:32:10.783 --> 01:32:13.545
-It's you I love, baby. With all my heart.
-Yeah.


1260
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:16.012
Me and every other woman
you meet.


1261
01:32:17.317 --> 01:32:19.782
You are amazing.

1262
01:32:19.984 --> 01:32:21.575
Neat work yourself, rookie.

1263
01:32:24.017 --> 01:32:25.915
Bastard.

1264
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:53.114
We start from scratch.

1265
01:33:02.384 --> 01:33:04.611
Who knows what I'll do?

1266
01:33:12.351 --> 01:33:15.545
She wakes. Grouchy as always.

1267
01:33:16.783 --> 01:33:18.749
Endlessly noisy.

1268
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:22.114
Endlessly alive.

1269
01:33:23.084 --> 01:33:25.516
She's all I really have.

1270
01:33:26.150 --> 01:33:28.412
My only hope.

1271
01:33:29.217 --> 01:33:31.410
My only constant.

1272
01:33:33.150 --> 01:33:35.548
The secrets of The Octopus
died with him.


1273
01:33:38.251 --> 01:33:40.376
I don't know what I am
or how long I got.


1274
01:33:40.583 --> 01:33:42.776
Heck, maybe I'll live forever.

1275
01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:44.507
I hope not.

1276
01:33:44.717 --> 01:33:46.580
That's nothing any man
ought to have.


1277
01:33:46.783 --> 01:33:49.215
That's nothing any man
ought to want.


1278
01:33:49.583 --> 01:33:52.379
Denny Colt is dead.
I'm something else now...


1279
01:33:52.583 --> 01:33:55.516
...and I can never give my heart
to anyone but her.


1280
01:33:55.717 --> 01:33:59.377
She will always be mine
and I will always be hers.


1281
01:33:59.583 --> 01:34:02.277
She owns me, body and soul.

1282
01:34:02.484 --> 01:34:05.075
She is the love of my life.

1283
01:34:05.683 --> 01:34:07.945
She is my city.

1284
01:34:09.950 --> 01:34:11.745
And I...

1285
01:34:12.050 --> 01:34:14.278
...am her Spirit.
