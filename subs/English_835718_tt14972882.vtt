1
00:00:26.448 --> 00:00:30.452
Roy Silver, now he was
a character who showed up.


2
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:34.282
Kind of a...

3
00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:40.375
He's kind of like...
How can you put it?


4
00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:45.816
He was kind of like a hustler type
on the street, you know, somebody...


5
00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.732
You know, trying to make a deal
about this


6
00:00:49.907 --> 00:00:51.996
and make a deal about that.
He was a fast talker.


7
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.738
Well, I saw him perform
all the time.


8
00:00:55.913 --> 00:00:57.958
I hung out with him.

9
00:00:58.132 --> 00:01:02.615
I was the guy.
I was his manager.


10
00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.098
I mean...
So I was there wearing,


11
00:01:07.272 --> 00:01:10.492
at that time,
as was my practice,


12
00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:12.190
I was the only one

13
00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:16.455
in the entire Village
that wore a suit.


14
00:01:16.629 --> 00:01:20.981
Everyone else was in jeans,
etcetera, etcetera.


15
00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:25.116
But I had my little outfit
and so forth...


16
00:01:26.421 --> 00:01:29.294
that I wore.
So, I saw him all the time.


17
00:01:29.468 --> 00:01:32.863
I mean, we met on a daily basis,

18
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:37.084
trying to figure out
what to do next.


19
00:01:37.258 --> 00:01:42.046
And I was trying to...
There was no question.


20
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.049
I was trying to make him a star,

21
00:01:45.223 --> 00:01:49.923
and I knew that he could
and would be a star.


22
00:01:50.968 --> 00:01:54.319
In the '60s, it was...
It was great.


23
00:01:54.493 --> 00:01:58.932
There was so much talent around
at that point,


24
00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:02.370
and in an undiscovered area,

25
00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:04.068
folk music.

26
00:02:04.242 --> 00:02:07.462
My God, who knew
from folk music?


27
00:02:07.636 --> 00:02:12.859
I mean, the only person that was alive
that any of us knew was Pete Seeger.


28
00:02:13.033 --> 00:02:18.691
No one understood
what was happening at that time.


29
00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:22.651
I mean, no one woke up and said,
"Oh, my God, it's folk music!"


30
00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:24.784
We were just out there.

31
00:02:24.958 --> 00:02:30.007
I mean, Pete Seeger was God,

32
00:02:30.181 --> 00:02:34.054
and we were just people working
and trying to make a buck


33
00:02:34.228 --> 00:02:40.104
and hoping that this would all
turn into something fabulous.


34
00:02:40.278 --> 00:02:45.152
And it did. You could smell it,
that there was something going on


35
00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:51.593
at that period of time that
would do away with the old stuff.


36
00:02:52.377 --> 00:02:54.292
No one ever thought,

37
00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:57.860
no one that I remember
at that time period


38
00:02:58.035 --> 00:03:05.129
ever thought that this was one
day going to who'd be Bob Dylan.


39
00:03:05.303 --> 00:03:11.918
I remember that he was strange
and that I was not going to...


40
00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:15.617
This was not anyone
that I was going to have


41
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:19.665
an easy time communicating with.

42
00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:25.584
This would be... I'd have to
pull everything out of him


43
00:03:25.758 --> 00:03:28.413
because he didn't know
where he was


44
00:03:28.587 --> 00:03:31.851
or what he was doing,
and so forth and so on.


45
00:03:32.025 --> 00:03:36.203
I mean, he was new
to the Village.


46
00:03:36.377 --> 00:03:43.080
Gerde's Folk City was the highest
his dreams had ever gone to.


47
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.433
So, you know,
it was hard to figure out


48
00:03:48.607 --> 00:03:51.827
where we were all
going to go with this.


49
00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:56.789
With Bob, I took a piece of paper
out of whatever, or I asked someone,


50
00:03:56.963 --> 00:04:00.967
and wrote down that,
"I, Bob Dylan, do hereby


51
00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:06.451
"agree to be managed
by Roy Silver for 20%."


52
00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:12.848
I forget what the period of time
was and so forth.


53
00:04:13.023 --> 00:04:17.679
And Bobby signed it.
It was really no big deal.


54
00:04:19.464 --> 00:04:21.074
He was strange.

55
00:04:21.248 --> 00:04:26.775
You were dealing with a guy
who had a strange voice,


56
00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:31.650
who had a strange rhythm,

57
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:40.050
who was playing a guitar
in a strange, humdrum fashion.


58
00:04:40.224 --> 00:04:42.661
I mean, that was
really the response.


59
00:04:42.835 --> 00:04:47.492
No one leaped up from their seat
at the end of the show


60
00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:51.800
and said,
"My God, the Messiah has come."


61
00:04:51.974 --> 00:04:53.889
No one. I mean, it was hard.

62
00:04:54.064 --> 00:04:57.415
He went up. He did a show.
He came off. He didn't do a show.


63
00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.071
No one ever accused Bob
of being a great performer.


64
00:05:01.941 --> 00:05:04.204
I mean, at any time.

65
00:05:04.378 --> 00:05:09.818
Bob came running up to see me
to play a new song for me.


66
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.040
So I said okay, and I sat there,

67
00:05:14.214 --> 00:05:17.435
and Bob whipped out
his rusty guitar


68
00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:21.569
and he played this song for me
and I said,


69
00:05:21.743 --> 00:05:25.530
"This is the greatest song
I've ever heard."


70
00:05:25.704 --> 00:05:29.229
And he was thrilled
that I said to him


71
00:05:29.403 --> 00:05:31.188
that this was a great song,
and I said,


72
00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:33.451
"We have to
record it immediately


73
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:37.455
"because I know a place
where this should go."


74
00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.631
"I'm going to call Artie Mogull
and everything,


75
00:05:39.805 --> 00:05:42.851
"but first, we've got to go in
and record it."


76
00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:46.246
And my memory tells me
that we went...


77
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.077
I went downstairs at Third
Avenue, at the place that we were at.


78
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:55.734
It was a Chinese laundry,
and I borrowed $50,


79
00:05:55.908 --> 00:05:59.346
'cause no one
had any money then.


80
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.131
I borrowed $50

81
00:06:01.305 --> 00:06:05.091
so that I could go
to 1619 Broadway,


82
00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:10.227
or wherever it was,
to make a record.


83
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:12.272
That's how we spoke
in those days.


84
00:06:12.446 --> 00:06:15.754
We were going to make
an acetate.


85
00:06:15.928 --> 00:06:20.237
Bob would sing
and play simultaneously,


86
00:06:20.411 --> 00:06:22.456
and we would run and record it.

87
00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:24.241
And I did that,

88
00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:29.333
and then I sent him home
because he was boring to be with


89
00:06:29.507 --> 00:06:32.771
and I didn't want to hang out
anymore with him.


90
00:06:32.945 --> 00:06:35.730
And then I went over to...

91
00:06:37.558 --> 00:06:40.126
the publishing company, Witmark.

92
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:45.131
It was one of those songs
that you knew,


93
00:06:45.305 --> 00:06:47.786
if you were
in the music business,


94
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:52.530
you knew that a gold mine
had just been discovered.


95
00:06:52.704 --> 00:06:57.099
We just arbitrarily decided
that we would do it


96
00:06:57.274 --> 00:06:59.841
with Peter, Paul and Mary.

97
00:07:00.015 --> 00:07:01.974
Came out three weeks later,

98
00:07:02.148 --> 00:07:04.803
a little song called
Blowin' in the Wind,


99
00:07:06.544 --> 00:07:11.505
went on to absolutely establish
who Bob was


100
00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:17.598
and what his place was
in the world, and deservedly so.


101
00:07:17.772 --> 00:07:22.690
I mean it was, to this day...
I mean, I can listen to it.


102
00:07:22.864 --> 00:07:27.217
I just heard it the other day
on someone and it just...


103
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:32.700
Blowin' in the Wind. I mean,
it brings tears to your eyes.


104
00:07:34.615 --> 00:07:39.707
How he could think of all of
that, how he made that all work.


105
00:07:39.881 --> 00:07:46.366
This nice little Jewish kid,
with nice little Jewish parents,


106
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.327
who had changed his name,
which was a big enough shanda,


107
00:07:50.501 --> 00:07:52.329
that means "disgrace,"

108
00:07:52.503 --> 00:07:55.941
at that time period, you know.

109
00:07:56.115 --> 00:07:57.899
And then it was onward
and upward.


110
00:10:33.011 --> 00:10:34.447
Albert Grossman.

111
00:10:34.621 --> 00:10:37.798
The thing that I love
the most about Albert.


112
00:10:37.972 --> 00:10:40.105
Albert had this trick.

113
00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:43.369
He could sit there in a room

114
00:10:43.543 --> 00:10:48.113
longer than anyone in the world
and not say a word.


115
00:10:48.287 --> 00:10:52.552
It was such an amazing... So
that people would find themselves


116
00:10:52.726 --> 00:10:56.295
all of a sudden getting up
and saying, "I did it, I killed him."


117
00:10:56.469 --> 00:10:59.646
I mean, they would
confess to anything


118
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.346
so as not to have to sit
in a room with Albert


119
00:11:04.521 --> 00:11:07.698
and let that silence swell out.

120
00:11:07.872 --> 00:11:09.003
He had an office.

121
00:11:12.529 --> 00:11:15.140
Not many people had offices
at that point.


122
00:11:15.314 --> 00:11:16.881
We were all living
in the Village.


123
00:11:17.925 --> 00:11:23.540
So, Albert and I
went into business together.


124
00:11:24.715 --> 00:11:30.503
I could see that Albert Grossman

125
00:11:30.677 --> 00:11:33.811
really wanted to take over...

126
00:11:36.422 --> 00:11:38.511
Dylan. I could see that.

127
00:11:38.685 --> 00:11:43.516
I mean, and he...
Albert had the money to do it.


128
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:48.216
Albert is, at best,
a strange guy,


129
00:11:49.348 --> 00:11:52.438
and I have no money.

130
00:11:53.091 --> 00:11:57.312
And I see that Bobby,

131
00:11:57.487 --> 00:12:02.622
who is easily,
in my opinion, manipulated


132
00:12:02.796 --> 00:12:05.451
because he didn't give a shit
in any way.


133
00:12:05.625 --> 00:12:10.325
He was just busy
"writing them songs."


134
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:17.289
I see that I'm going to
lose out on this.


135
00:12:17.463 --> 00:12:22.468
That it's not going to work
the way that I want it to work.


136
00:12:22.642 --> 00:12:29.562
So I better move quickly,
and I come up with the scheme


137
00:12:29.736 --> 00:12:35.133
of selling my share
of Dylan's contract.


138
00:12:35.307 --> 00:12:37.831
We had split it 50-50,

139
00:12:38.876 --> 00:12:41.922
and my share should be sold,

140
00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:44.490
and I should get $10,000.

141
00:12:44.664 --> 00:12:48.189
I have to tell you that $10,000

142
00:12:48.363 --> 00:12:52.846
in 1961 was a fortune.

143
00:12:53.804 --> 00:12:57.111
That was a lot of money
at that point.


144
00:12:58.896 --> 00:13:04.031
But he was always
very sweet to me,


145
00:13:05.772 --> 00:13:09.820
you know, after the dissolution
and so forth and so on.


146
00:13:09.994 --> 00:13:15.216
And I felt that,
my own personal feeling...


147
00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:20.613
I always thought that Albert took
away so much of the fun of him.


148
00:13:21.658 --> 00:13:23.877
But that's my opinion.

149
00:13:24.051 --> 00:13:29.100
I thought he was a warmer,
more mellow guy


150
00:13:29.274 --> 00:13:32.016
than Albert had turned him into.

151
00:13:33.713 --> 00:13:37.108
The song Blowin' in the Wind,
my favorite song.


152
00:13:38.239 --> 00:13:40.198
And I was there.

153
00:13:40.372 --> 00:13:45.769
"How many roads must a man walk
down before they call him a man?


154
00:13:45.943 --> 00:13:50.382
"Yes, and how many seas
must a white dove sail


155
00:13:50.556 --> 00:13:52.950
"before she sleeps in the sand?

156
00:13:53.124 --> 00:13:57.389
"Yes, and how many times
must the cannonballs fly


157
00:13:57.563 --> 00:13:59.739
"before they're forever banned?

158
00:13:59.913 --> 00:14:03.395
"The answer, my friend,
is blowing in the wind.


159
00:14:03.569 --> 00:14:05.353
"The answer is blowing
in the wind."


160
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.797
Okay.

161
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:19.672
It's so funny
to read this lyric now.


162
00:14:20.717 --> 00:14:23.067
That's 100 years old.

163
00:14:23.241 --> 00:14:26.984
We've all heard it for,
you know, so long.


164
00:14:27.158 --> 00:14:31.162
Now it's become...
It's moved beyond what it was


165
00:14:31.336 --> 00:14:33.251
in a strange kind of a way.

166
00:14:35.079 --> 00:14:37.690
Although, I told you,
I heard it the other day.


167
00:14:38.952 --> 00:14:42.216
I forget where,
and I started to cry.


168
00:14:51.922 --> 00:14:54.141
I got out of the current
George Washington Bridge,


169
00:14:54.315 --> 00:14:56.274
took the subway down the road.

170
00:14:56.448 --> 00:14:59.625
Went to the Cafe Wha?,
I looked out at the crowd.


171
00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:04.456
"Does anybody know where a
couple of people could stay tonight?"


172
00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.284
I was ready for New York.

173
00:15:08.112 --> 00:15:10.201
So, this guy comes in.

174
00:15:10.375 --> 00:15:14.466
He didn't look too prepossessing,
didn't look the wild sort.


175
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:17.382
He looked like an ordinary kid.

176
00:15:20.167 --> 00:15:23.083
He said, "Listen, I got some
songs I want you to hear."


177
00:15:23.257 --> 00:15:26.521
So I was, "Oh, God. Can you
come tomorrow? Get out of here."


178
00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:28.480
He said, "No, I want
to sing you a song."


179
00:15:28.654 --> 00:15:30.047
So I let him sing the song.

180
00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.136
And then I started
pointing people.


181
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.070
I said, "Listen,
see that guy in the back room?


182
00:15:34.094 --> 00:15:36.096
"His name is Bob Dylan.
You should listen to him.


183
00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:38.664
"The guy's writing good songs,
he's terrific."


184
00:15:38.838 --> 00:15:41.885
Al Jolson was the first
successful folk manager


185
00:15:42.059 --> 00:15:44.278
who knew how to make money
out of the singles.


186
00:15:44.452 --> 00:15:46.541
Albert tells me one day
they're going to send a guy


187
00:15:46.716 --> 00:15:48.674
over to see me
named Bob Dylan.


188
00:15:48.848 --> 00:15:53.505
He's got a guitar with some kind
of a contraption around his neck,


189
00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:56.203
so that the harmonica
is up to his mouth.


190
00:15:56.377 --> 00:16:00.642
Now, believe me when I tell you,
nobody had ever seen this before.


191
00:16:00.817 --> 00:16:02.732
And he starts singing for me.

192
00:16:17.921 --> 00:16:22.621
The music business per se was
dominated by music publishers.


193
00:16:22.795 --> 00:16:24.971
In those days,
the song was important.


194
00:16:27.234 --> 00:16:29.671
When I heard "How many
ears must one man have


195
00:16:29.846 --> 00:16:32.762
"before he can hear people cry?"
I flipped.


196
00:16:32.936 --> 00:16:35.656
I can't even remember what the
songs were that he played me that day.


197
00:16:35.808 --> 00:16:37.984
But I said, "Okay, that's it.
I want you.


198
00:16:38.158 --> 00:16:40.073
"I'll give you
a writer's contract."


199
00:16:40.247 --> 00:16:42.902
And we got a contract ready
and he signed it.


200
00:16:43.076 --> 00:16:46.036
I didn't tell anybody for a bit
because, you know,


201
00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.038
I almost wasn't sure
it was happening myself.


202
00:16:48.212 --> 00:16:50.605
So I don't think
I really told anybody


203
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:53.608
until I actually
went through with the sessions.


204
00:17:01.225 --> 00:17:03.749
Now, Bob, when he started
to bring me songs,


205
00:17:03.923 --> 00:17:07.144
the lyrics were written on this
long yellow legal-size paper.


206
00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:10.408
Every one of the songs
came to me that way.


207
00:17:11.452 --> 00:17:14.151
The Times They Are A-Changin',
all the classics.


208
00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:16.980
And we would take him
into this little tiny studio


209
00:17:17.154 --> 00:17:20.026
that was across from my office
and he would make a tape,


210
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:23.813
singing the song,
playing the guitar.


211
00:17:23.987 --> 00:17:27.773
I would then take the tape
and give it to our head copyist,


212
00:17:27.947 --> 00:17:30.776
who was a guy
named Simeon Saber.


213
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:33.257
Simeon Saber was about

214
00:17:33.431 --> 00:17:37.783
and he'd been sitting there with
his green eyeshade for 45 years,


215
00:17:37.957 --> 00:17:41.787
copying the songs
of Victor Herbert, Rudolf Friml,


216
00:17:41.961 --> 00:17:46.618
and now I'm bringing him songs
about rats eating babies.


217
00:17:46.792 --> 00:17:48.750
He comes to me one day
and he says,


218
00:17:48.925 --> 00:17:52.015
"We've got to get a young
copyist in. I just can't do this."


219
00:17:52.189 --> 00:17:55.279
Strangely enough,
even the old people there,


220
00:17:55.453 --> 00:17:57.934
everybody got on
the Dylan bandwagon.


221
00:17:58.108 --> 00:18:01.154
Everybody started
to record Bob Dylan songs.


222
00:18:01.328 --> 00:18:03.528
Helped, of course, by the fact
that Peter, Paul and Mary


223
00:18:03.678 --> 00:18:06.246
didBlowin' in the Wind
and thenDon't Think Twice.


224
00:18:09.771 --> 00:18:12.122
And I think it was the fact

225
00:18:12.296 --> 00:18:15.255
that all these other artists
did Bob,


226
00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:18.258
is what made him
start to become so big.


227
00:18:29.313 --> 00:18:33.752
He was the first artist
who could record an album


228
00:18:33.926 --> 00:18:39.062
of 10 or 12 songs and be the
writer and publisher of all the songs.


229
00:18:39.236 --> 00:18:44.197
Previous to that, if Nat Cole
recorded an album of 12 songs,


230
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:46.852
12 different writers
and 12 different publishers


231
00:18:47.026 --> 00:18:49.289
wrote those songs.

232
00:18:49.463 --> 00:18:52.103
In Bob's case, he really was
writing all these great original songs


233
00:18:52.205 --> 00:18:55.426
and on all the publishing
and all the writing.


234
00:18:56.557 --> 00:18:59.256
It was the beginning of the end

235
00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.649
of what used to be known as
Tin Pan Alley.


236
00:19:16.055 --> 00:19:17.685
I wrote a lot of songs
in a quick amount of time.


237
00:19:17.709 --> 00:19:19.189
I could do that then.

238
00:19:19.363 --> 00:19:24.063
Because the process
was new to me.


239
00:19:36.902 --> 00:19:40.253
Yes, I don't think
a lot of people realize.


240
00:19:40.427 --> 00:19:43.735
Even I question,
where did this come from?


241
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:45.955
How does he come up with these?

242
00:19:46.129 --> 00:19:49.959
How did this kid
from Hibbing, Minnesota...


243
00:19:51.743 --> 00:19:53.658
How was this in him?

244
00:19:53.832 --> 00:19:56.113
I'll tell you something else
interesting about those demos


245
00:19:56.226 --> 00:19:57.836
that we used to make with Bob.

246
00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.056
Some place there exists
the tapes on those.


247
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:02.406
I have the tapes.

248
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.886
You actually found the tapes
from those demos he made?


249
00:20:05.061 --> 00:20:08.107
We have all the original tapes
from the demos in the original boxes.


250
00:20:08.281 --> 00:20:09.630
Well, that could be
a great album.


251
00:20:31.348 --> 00:20:33.959
Today's young people
have more leisure time


252
00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:36.353
than any previous generation,

253
00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:40.139
and more ways to fill those
hours between work and play.


254
00:20:42.228 --> 00:20:45.492
For practically everyone
twixt 12 and 20,


255
00:20:45.666 --> 00:20:49.322
one activity to beat the band
is music.


256
00:20:49.496 --> 00:20:53.413
Whether blasting from
a transistor radio at the beach


257
00:20:53.587 --> 00:20:56.242
or the record player
in your bedroom,


258
00:20:56.416 --> 00:20:59.941
music is in the air
that teenagers breathe.


259
00:21:00.116 --> 00:21:02.988
But like any healthy
teenage activity,


260
00:21:03.162 --> 00:21:07.645
music could be corrupted
by unscrupulous profiteers


261
00:21:07.819 --> 00:21:13.520
out to push the latest dubious
gimmick in the name of progress.


262
00:21:13.694 --> 00:21:16.132
You kids have to be careful
of these snake oil salesmen


263
00:21:16.306 --> 00:21:17.829
trying to sell you stereo sound.

264
00:21:18.003 --> 00:21:20.440
It's just a scam
to raise the price of records.


265
00:21:20.614 --> 00:21:23.313
But my boyfriend says that
stereo makes it sound


266
00:21:23.487 --> 00:21:26.272
like a group is playing
right in your bedroom.


267
00:21:26.446 --> 00:21:28.381
Yeah, and how would your dad
feel if one of these rock groups


268
00:21:28.405 --> 00:21:30.189
did come and play
in your bedroom?


269
00:21:30.363 --> 00:21:33.497
Well, I guess he wouldn't
really go for that.


270
00:21:33.671 --> 00:21:37.718
Darn right he wouldn't, and
neither would your neighbors.


271
00:21:37.892 --> 00:21:41.635
Stereo sound purports to split
the signal between two speakers,


272
00:21:41.809 --> 00:21:44.769
putting half the music in
one side and half in the other.


273
00:21:44.943 --> 00:21:47.685
They claim that when the music
is reassembled in your brain,


274
00:21:47.859 --> 00:21:49.426
it fools you into thinking

275
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.645
you're hearing a band
spread out around the room.


276
00:21:51.819 --> 00:21:53.604
Why would I want
to fool my brain?


277
00:21:53.778 --> 00:21:55.867
Exactly, Scottie.

278
00:21:56.041 --> 00:21:59.392
By introducing deceptive
patterns into the adolescent mind,


279
00:21:59.566 --> 00:22:03.440
stereo sound plays havoc
with the still-developing tissue


280
00:22:03.614 --> 00:22:08.140
of the teenage brain. Stereo
is designed to lie to you.


281
00:22:08.314 --> 00:22:10.273
The fallacy
of the stereo sales pitch


282
00:22:10.447 --> 00:22:12.362
is that it's based
on the false syllogism


283
00:22:12.536 --> 00:22:16.627
that two speakers
equal your two ears.


284
00:22:16.801 --> 00:22:19.499
But what it ignores
is that you only have one brain,


285
00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:21.806
and you don't listen to music
with your ears,


286
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.547
you listen with your brain.

287
00:22:25.114 --> 00:22:27.638
What is the antidote
to stereo?


288
00:22:27.812 --> 00:22:31.729
Well, it's been right
in your home all along.


289
00:22:31.903 --> 00:22:34.775
Good old American mono.

290
00:22:36.081 --> 00:22:37.256
In the recording studio,

291
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:39.998
each instrument
has its own microphone.


292
00:22:40.172 --> 00:22:43.088
Trained technicians on the
other side of the protective window


293
00:22:43.262 --> 00:22:45.830
balance the volume levels
to achieve an ideal blend.


294
00:22:47.571 --> 00:22:50.226
With mono recording,
you hear that same perfect blend


295
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.097
wherever you're standing.

296
00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:53.838
However, with stereo recording,

297
00:22:54.012 --> 00:22:55.772
you may hear a blaring trumpet
in the left speaker,


298
00:22:55.796 --> 00:22:58.408
an out-of-tune electric guitar
in the right speaker,


299
00:22:58.582 --> 00:23:01.802
and a honking Lowrey organ
somewhere on the ceiling.


300
00:23:01.976 --> 00:23:04.240
And here's
something you may not know.


301
00:23:04.414 --> 00:23:08.940
Today's most with-it groups
mix all their records in mono.


302
00:23:09.114 --> 00:23:11.029
That's the true recording.

303
00:23:11.203 --> 00:23:13.162
Stereo mixes are often done

304
00:23:13.336 --> 00:23:17.383
after the musicians you love
have left the room.


305
00:23:18.645 --> 00:23:21.039
This whole stereo stampede
is nothing but a flimflam


306
00:23:21.213 --> 00:23:23.607
to trick teenagers
into paying more for records.


307
00:23:24.434 --> 00:23:26.044
$3.50?

308
00:23:26.218 --> 00:23:28.177
That's more than
my whole allowance.


309
00:23:28.351 --> 00:23:30.570
Once customers
swallow high stereo prices,


310
00:23:30.744 --> 00:23:33.834
many stores may stop
selling mono records altogether.


311
00:23:34.008 --> 00:23:36.446
They can't do that, can they?

312
00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.971
Teenagers are
the future of America.


313
00:23:40.145 --> 00:23:43.409
These young twisters, swingers
and go-go kids


314
00:23:43.583 --> 00:23:45.803
will someday be our senators,

315
00:23:45.977 --> 00:23:48.806
astronauts and homemakers,

316
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.025
but to live in the future,

317
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.985
everyone will need
a fully functioning brain.


318
00:23:54.159 --> 00:24:01.253
Everyone will need to be able to
think clearly, straightforwardly in mono.


319
00:24:01.427 --> 00:24:02.950
I'm sticking with mono.

320
00:24:04.082 --> 00:24:05.953
I'm sticking with mono.

321
00:24:06.127 --> 00:24:09.261
Let's all
stick with mono.


322
00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:53.790
Between 1965 and 1966, Bob
Dylan recorded three albums


323
00:27:53.964 --> 00:27:57.097
that many believe changed
the course of modern music.


324
00:27:57.271 --> 00:27:58.838
Bringing It All Back Home,

325
00:27:59.012 --> 00:28:01.885
Highway 61 Revisited
andBlonde on Blonde.


326
00:28:02.059 --> 00:28:05.410
The Cutting Edge,
The Bootleg Series Volume 12


327
00:28:05.584 --> 00:28:07.281
takes you inside the studio

328
00:28:07.456 --> 00:28:10.502
during the recording of
these three legendary albums.


329
00:28:29.869 --> 00:28:32.698
With a staggering
wealth of unreleased songs,


330
00:28:32.872 --> 00:28:35.527
outtakes, rehearsals
and alternate versions,


331
00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:37.790
The Cutting Edge
provides a unique look


332
00:28:37.964 --> 00:28:41.054
into one man's
astonishing creative process.


333
00:28:41.664 --> 00:28:43.013
My Girl, take one.

334
00:28:44.623 --> 00:28:47.496
January 1965,
Dylan arrives


335
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:52.588
at CBS Recording Studios in
Manhattan looking for a new sound.


336
00:29:21.878 --> 00:29:24.141
OnThe Cutting Edge,
we follow that journey


337
00:29:24.315 --> 00:29:28.014
as the elements ofBringing It
All Back Home fall into place.


338
00:29:43.247 --> 00:29:45.510
Hey, I can't...

339
00:29:45.684 --> 00:29:48.164
Hey, the drumming is driving
me mad. I'm going out of my brain.


340
00:29:54.345 --> 00:29:57.348
Six months later, Bob
Dylan is back in the studio.


341
00:30:07.401 --> 00:30:09.534
At this point,
his switch to electric music


342
00:30:09.708 --> 00:30:11.710
has already alienated
some fans,


343
00:30:11.884 --> 00:30:15.192
at the same time
created a whole new audience.


344
00:30:16.933 --> 00:30:19.936
The resulting album,
Highway 61 Revisited


345
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.461
is Dylan's first
fully realized rock album.


346
00:30:53.404 --> 00:30:57.669
On his next album, the sonic
landscape shifts once again.


347
00:30:57.843 --> 00:30:59.976
It takes several tries
and multiple cities


348
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.457
to finally realize
Dylan's distinctive vision


349
00:31:03.632 --> 00:31:05.982
for rock's first double album.

350
00:31:06.722 --> 00:31:08.245
Blonde on Blonde.

351
00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.118
But onThe Cutting Edge,

352
00:31:12.292 --> 00:31:14.991
even the wrong directions
can yield glorious results.


353
00:31:23.086 --> 00:31:25.305
The Cutting Edge
presents an alternate history


354
00:31:25.479 --> 00:31:28.831
for some of the most
distinctive songs ever recorded.


355
00:31:46.849 --> 00:31:51.157
You are there for the evolution
of one classic after another,


356
00:31:51.331 --> 00:31:54.552
and all of it is tied together
with Dylan's unerring sense


357
00:31:54.726 --> 00:31:57.294
of lyrical and musical mastery.

358
00:32:32.851 --> 00:32:35.027
Hello, I'm Bob Egan of PopSpots,

359
00:32:35.201 --> 00:32:38.030
the website where I track down where
old record album covers were made.


360
00:32:38.204 --> 00:32:42.121
Today we're going to look at Bob
Dylan's Bringing It All back Home.


361
00:32:42.295 --> 00:32:44.863
Now, today I'm on Minetta Street
in Greenwich Village,


362
00:32:45.037 --> 00:32:46.778
the center of
the folk movement,


363
00:32:46.952 --> 00:32:49.694
and I'm standing next to what
used to be called The Commons.


364
00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:53.089
And in 1962, Dylan wrote
Blowin' in the Windright here.


365
00:32:53.263 --> 00:32:56.745
Now, back in that era,
he was a scruffy looking kid


366
00:32:56.919 --> 00:33:00.052
who just blew in from the Midwest,
and he would be photographed that way.


367
00:33:00.226 --> 00:33:03.186
But three years later,
he's a changed guy.


368
00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.883
Rock 'n' roll has come.

369
00:33:05.057 --> 00:33:05.754
The Beatles have come,
The Rolling Stones have come.


370
00:33:05.928 --> 00:33:07.973
New fashions have come.

371
00:33:08.147 --> 00:33:10.386
When he put out this album,
he's dressed like a country squire.


372
00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:12.084
He's in the middle
of a nice, beautiful house


373
00:33:12.108 --> 00:33:14.414
next to a beautiful woman,
he's got a Persian cat.


374
00:33:14.588 --> 00:33:19.202
Basically, what he's trying to do here
is say, "I'm past the folk movement.


375
00:33:19.376 --> 00:33:23.206
"I'm moving on." As a matter of
fact, half the record is acoustic,


376
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:25.904
that's the old world,
and half is electric.


377
00:33:26.078 --> 00:33:27.906
Right here,
this is Sally Grossman.


378
00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.735
Bob's manager was Albert
Grossman and that was his wife.


379
00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:33.651
This photograph is taken
on the Grossman's estate


380
00:33:33.825 --> 00:33:38.569
up in Bearsville, New York,
which is just west of Woodstock.


381
00:33:38.743 --> 00:33:41.311
How many pictures
did you take like this?


382
00:33:41.485 --> 00:33:42.921
Ten.

383
00:33:43.095 --> 00:33:45.054
And how did you decide
on this particular shot?


384
00:33:45.228 --> 00:33:48.231
The only one in which the cat
was looking at the lens.


385
00:33:48.405 --> 00:33:50.450
How'd you get that
yellow circle of light?


386
00:33:50.624 --> 00:33:52.104
As I explained to Bob that

387
00:33:52.278 --> 00:33:55.412
what would happen
if we do this effect,


388
00:33:55.586 --> 00:34:00.286
- we will have things blurry and moving...
- Yeah.


389
00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:03.376
...but you won't be moving
because you're the center.


390
00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:05.030
You know what's going on.

391
00:34:05.204 --> 00:34:09.818
But around you, there's
the turning of the world.


392
00:34:09.992 --> 00:34:12.211
Also the turning of the record.

393
00:34:12.385 --> 00:34:14.953
Any reason why you put
Dylan's own album in the back?


394
00:34:15.127 --> 00:34:16.757
Just kind of like his history,
is that it?


395
00:34:16.781 --> 00:34:19.131
My back pages.

396
00:34:19.305 --> 00:34:21.742
Bob put a lot of things in that
had some meaning for him.


397
00:34:21.917 --> 00:34:23.788
Bob Dylan with Daniel Kramer,

398
00:34:23.962 --> 00:34:26.042
they spent about three hours
going through the house,


399
00:34:26.138 --> 00:34:28.010
just picking up
all sorts of old stuff,


400
00:34:28.184 --> 00:34:30.708
including the record album
and, you know, movies.


401
00:34:30.882 --> 00:34:32.512
And then, you know,
like old world paintings.


402
00:34:32.536 --> 00:34:34.146
He's got these pink cufflinks.

403
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.757
They were a present to him
by Joan Baez.


404
00:34:36.932 --> 00:34:41.153
And he's got, you know, a lot of
the objects of his past,


405
00:34:41.327 --> 00:34:43.286
including one of his
old albums in the middle.


406
00:35:07.919 --> 00:35:09.766
Hi, I'm Bob Egan of PopSpots,
and on my website,


407
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:12.837
I searched down where famous
record album covers were done.


408
00:35:13.011 --> 00:35:15.013
Today I'm sitting
on the front steps


409
00:35:15.187 --> 00:35:18.582
of where Bob Dylan lived
for two years, starting in 1961.


410
00:35:18.756 --> 00:35:23.674
Today we're going to go look at
the location of Highway 61 Revisited.


411
00:35:23.848 --> 00:35:25.763
Bob lived here
and he took this photograph


412
00:35:25.937 --> 00:35:27.808
right down these steps,
down the street,


413
00:35:27.983 --> 00:35:29.583
right over to the corner
of Jones Street.


414
00:35:29.636 --> 00:35:31.551
They probably walked
right by this spot,


415
00:35:31.725 --> 00:35:34.008
where they took the shot for
Freewheelin' several years before.


416
00:35:34.032 --> 00:35:36.861
So now follow me
and we're gonna go see


417
00:35:37.035 --> 00:35:39.472
the rest of where
the other part of the shoot was


418
00:35:39.646 --> 00:35:41.648
for Highway 61.

419
00:35:41.822 --> 00:35:43.713
The street corner at Sixth
Avenue and West Fourth Street.


420
00:35:43.737 --> 00:35:46.871
And where they went,
this place called O' Henry's.


421
00:35:47.045 --> 00:35:49.395
And it was a famous,
old fashioned,


422
00:35:49.569 --> 00:35:52.790
you know, kind of
barbershop-quartet-era type restaurant


423
00:35:52.964 --> 00:35:54.748
that was located right here.

424
00:35:54.923 --> 00:35:58.839
After lunch, Bob and Daniel
went up to Gramercy Park.


425
00:35:59.014 --> 00:36:01.581
So, I'm always on the lookout
for different locations,


426
00:36:01.755 --> 00:36:05.150
you know, where album covers
were done and I saw a book that said


427
00:36:05.324 --> 00:36:08.893
that Janis Joplin used to sit on
the front steps of the building


428
00:36:09.067 --> 00:36:12.418
where it was taken,
and look out at Gramercy Park.


429
00:36:12.592 --> 00:36:15.378
When I found that Janis Joplin

430
00:36:15.552 --> 00:36:19.251
had been
at Albert Grossman's apartment,


431
00:36:19.425 --> 00:36:23.038
I zoomed in on the door and I
said, "This is the same door."


432
00:36:23.212 --> 00:36:24.735
I couldn't believe it because

433
00:36:24.909 --> 00:36:27.129
the whole time that I was
thinking about this album,


434
00:36:27.303 --> 00:36:31.916
I thought that it was done
indoors inside of a stage,


435
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:33.894
because it looks like
it's kind of like a theater arch


436
00:36:33.918 --> 00:36:35.441
on the right hand side.

437
00:36:35.615 --> 00:36:37.455
So I was... My mind was blown
when it turns out


438
00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:39.663
that it's outdoors
after all this time.


439
00:36:39.837 --> 00:36:41.839
This is a place
where Dylan stayed for,


440
00:36:42.013 --> 00:36:43.253
you know, long periods of time.

441
00:36:43.319 --> 00:36:46.104
When they got here, Dylan said,

442
00:36:46.278 --> 00:36:48.977
"I want to go in
and have you take a picture


443
00:36:49.151 --> 00:36:51.283
"using my new Triumph T-shirt."

444
00:36:51.457 --> 00:36:54.852
So he went and got the Triumph
T-shirt and he sat down.


445
00:36:55.026 --> 00:36:58.203
Usually, you have a plan,
especially for a cover.


446
00:36:58.377 --> 00:36:59.377
Yeah.

447
00:36:59.422 --> 00:37:01.554
And this wasn't the plan.

448
00:37:01.728 --> 00:37:04.296
This was kind of all naked here.

449
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:07.691
So I asked Neuwirth
if he'd stand here.


450
00:37:07.865 --> 00:37:13.653
So I grabbed my camera and I
said, "Bob, hold this camera."


451
00:37:13.827 --> 00:37:18.745
Now, once he did that, it seems
like something's going on.


452
00:37:18.919 --> 00:37:23.315
Not that we're taking a picture,
but there's a making of a picture.


453
00:37:23.489 --> 00:37:26.362
There's a photographer,
he's got his camera.


454
00:37:26.536 --> 00:37:29.060
This wasn't the plan.

455
00:37:29.234 --> 00:37:33.804
This wasn't even expected that
we would do a picture like this.


456
00:37:33.978 --> 00:37:35.849
Kramer then took
two different pictures


457
00:37:36.024 --> 00:37:37.503
and one of the pictures...

458
00:37:37.677 --> 00:37:40.289
You know, the last picture
of the day that they shot


459
00:37:40.463 --> 00:37:43.988
was the one that became
the album cover.


460
00:38:08.795 --> 00:38:10.232
This is Bob Egan from PopSpots.

461
00:38:10.406 --> 00:38:11.798
It's a website
where I track down


462
00:38:11.972 --> 00:38:13.670
where famous record album covers
were done.


463
00:38:13.844 --> 00:38:17.500
Today we're gonna look at where
Blonde On Blonde


464
00:38:17.674 --> 00:38:21.504
from 1966, Bob Dylan's album,
was photographed.


465
00:38:21.678 --> 00:38:24.507
Standing next to Jerry Schatzberg,
who took that photograph.


466
00:38:24.681 --> 00:38:26.596
This is your studio.
It was right up here.


467
00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:29.120
Dylan picked you
and one of your assistants up.


468
00:38:29.294 --> 00:38:30.894
And where did you go
to take the picture?


469
00:38:30.991 --> 00:38:34.343
What I remember was the
Meatpacking District downtown.


470
00:38:34.517 --> 00:38:36.823
- Okay, that's about 14th Street.
- Possibly.


471
00:38:36.997 --> 00:38:38.037
Way over on the west side.

472
00:38:38.173 --> 00:38:39.348
Let's go check it out.

473
00:38:43.352 --> 00:38:45.528
We're going to
the Meatpacking District


474
00:38:45.702 --> 00:38:50.359
because I know that I photographed
Dylan there for Blonde on Blonde.


475
00:38:50.533 --> 00:38:52.012
Or I think
I photographed him there.


476
00:38:52.187 --> 00:38:55.233
We're just trying
to discover where


477
00:38:55.407 --> 00:38:58.541
because they've gentrified
the areas so much.


478
00:38:58.715 --> 00:39:02.545
We're hoping to
uncover the mystery.


479
00:39:05.896 --> 00:39:10.379
Tell me exactly why the pictures
are blurred on the cover.


480
00:39:10.553 --> 00:39:12.250
It was pretty cold out,
you know.


481
00:39:12.424 --> 00:39:15.297
I know all the critics,
everybody trying to figure,


482
00:39:15.471 --> 00:39:19.257
"Oh, they were trying to do
a drug shot or something."


483
00:39:19.431 --> 00:39:23.479
It's not true. It was February.
He was wearing just that jacket.


484
00:39:23.653 --> 00:39:26.351
I was wearing something similar.
The two of us were really cold.


485
00:39:26.525 --> 00:39:29.615
And to his credit, he's the one
that chose that photograph.


486
00:39:31.095 --> 00:39:35.665
Some place in here
might be the building,


487
00:39:35.839 --> 00:39:37.754
but it's totally disguised now.

488
00:39:40.974 --> 00:39:44.935
So far, this is the closest thing
that I've seen in all these years.


489
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:47.155
They covered
over the brick here.


490
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:49.592
It could be this building, too,
without this top.


491
00:39:49.766 --> 00:39:53.117
I think this building
looks very possible.


492
00:39:54.074 --> 00:39:55.815
It's been a good experience
for me


493
00:39:55.989 --> 00:39:58.185
because I really thought that
the building would be torn down.


494
00:39:58.209 --> 00:40:00.049
Now I think that it might be
up here somewhere.


495
00:40:00.124 --> 00:40:02.405
- Still might be up...
- I think the job is up to you now.


496
00:40:02.518 --> 00:40:04.563
- I'll see you. Thanks, guys.
- Okay.


497
00:43:56.404 --> 00:43:58.014
The big show special!

498
00:44:13.682 --> 00:44:16.075
Well, if it isn't the Hunchback
of Notre Dame himself.


499
00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:20.210
How's it going to sound tonight?

500
00:44:20.384 --> 00:44:21.516
Great.

501
00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:23.605
Better than it has in days.

502
00:44:25.389 --> 00:44:27.478
Well, what was
life like on the road then?


503
00:44:27.652 --> 00:44:31.047
- You know, on that tour?
- Hectic.


504
00:44:31.221 --> 00:44:34.920
Hard, sleepless, driving.

505
00:44:36.835 --> 00:44:38.141
Crazy.

506
00:44:40.143 --> 00:44:42.058
You talking to me?

507
00:44:52.329 --> 00:44:54.113
Come up here and say that.

508
00:44:54.287 --> 00:44:55.874
It was the worst thing
anyone could go through, man.


509
00:44:55.898 --> 00:44:59.031
Can't even hear the guitar
to put it in tune.


510
00:44:59.205 --> 00:45:01.251
There's something wrong
with the sound system.


511
00:45:01.425 --> 00:45:03.601
It has got to be fixed.

512
00:45:03.775 --> 00:45:05.385
It never occurred
to me to question it.


513
00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:06.952
I was just doing it.

514
00:45:07.126 --> 00:45:10.216
They asked me to do it
and I did it.


515
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:11.890
- You can follow him.
- On the other side.


516
00:45:11.914 --> 00:45:13.698
- Show him what side.
- On the other side.


517
00:45:13.872 --> 00:45:15.744
You want me to show you
where I'm plugged in?


518
00:45:15.918 --> 00:45:17.718
I'll show you where
I'm plugged in, over here.


519
00:45:18.573 --> 00:45:20.096
I was always about the music.

520
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:24.448
I was never about the mechanics
of being a sound man.


521
00:45:24.622 --> 00:45:26.929
So if the music was good,
I was happy.


522
00:45:43.467 --> 00:45:45.121
I can't...

523
00:45:46.165 --> 00:45:48.603
It's not the same, you know?

524
00:45:49.473 --> 00:45:52.171
I can't hear it coming back.

525
00:45:52.345 --> 00:45:53.651
I don't know what it is, man.

526
00:45:53.825 --> 00:45:55.087
One, two.

527
00:45:56.306 --> 00:45:57.612
One, two.

528
00:45:58.526 --> 00:46:00.440
I didn't change anything.

529
00:46:00.615 --> 00:46:02.617
I bet something's wrong
with the wires.


530
00:46:26.423 --> 00:46:30.383
I lived in a fifth floor
walk-up on Bleecker Street,


531
00:46:30.558 --> 00:46:33.691
right across the street from
where the Village Gate was.


532
00:46:33.865 --> 00:46:36.476
And I just hung out
in the Village.


533
00:46:36.651 --> 00:46:39.175
And I met Bob
for the first time


534
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:42.308
when he was just playing
folk music and hanging out.


535
00:46:42.482 --> 00:46:47.009
My friend introduced me to
the new owners of the Gaslight.


536
00:46:47.183 --> 00:46:49.185
They had me
put in the sound system,


537
00:46:49.359 --> 00:46:51.056
and then somebody said,

538
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:54.669
"Well, Dylan's going to premiere
a bunch of songs after hours


539
00:46:54.843 --> 00:46:57.672
"and you should
come and tape it."


540
00:46:59.891 --> 00:47:02.677
The atmosphere was so wonderful
in the Gaslight.


541
00:47:02.851 --> 00:47:04.896
And it had a special quality

542
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:08.030
that studio recordings
could never have.


543
00:47:19.737 --> 00:47:21.696
It was just overwhelming.

544
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:26.396
I mean, I had seen all kinds
of people perform,


545
00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:28.746
and nobody gave me chills
like that.


546
00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.183
Nothing even came close to it.

547
00:47:32.097 --> 00:47:36.232
Tito, listen,
we seem to have a problem.


548
00:47:36.406 --> 00:47:39.975
I'd done a lot of live
sound work for Grossman.


549
00:47:40.149 --> 00:47:43.369
When it came time
for Dylan to go on tour,


550
00:47:43.543 --> 00:47:46.155
Grossman asked me
to build the sound system


551
00:47:46.329 --> 00:47:48.679
and I said yes.

552
00:47:48.853 --> 00:47:51.726
I need an electrician.
My power's all gone.


553
00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:54.163
It's Richard's power, man.
Come on.


554
00:47:54.337 --> 00:47:56.774
I fit perfectly
into that situation


555
00:47:56.948 --> 00:48:00.256
because I was really
a kind of hi-fi purist


556
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:01.953
as far as sound is concerned.

557
00:48:02.127 --> 00:48:04.608
Richard's power.
Give him his power back.


558
00:48:05.217 --> 00:48:06.741
Let's have the power.

559
00:48:06.915 --> 00:48:11.441
I had no rehearsals with Dylan
because I was busy


560
00:48:11.615 --> 00:48:14.270
getting the gear together
and setting it up.


561
00:48:19.449 --> 00:48:21.320
I built the sound system.

562
00:48:21.494 --> 00:48:23.932
I had to make up the tables
and I had to connect everything


563
00:48:24.106 --> 00:48:26.151
and I had to put it
into the road cases


564
00:48:26.325 --> 00:48:27.849
and get it on the plane.

565
00:48:28.719 --> 00:48:30.678
It was shipped to Honolulu.

566
00:48:31.809 --> 00:48:33.811
The first time I used
the whole sound system


567
00:48:33.985 --> 00:48:35.857
was on the stage in Honolulu.

568
00:48:36.031 --> 00:48:39.512
And I was still soldering wires
on the stage in Stockholm.


569
00:48:39.687 --> 00:48:42.124
I remember that very well.

570
00:48:42.298 --> 00:48:44.258
Just give me time
to get across to the other side.


571
00:48:44.343 --> 00:48:48.434
I mean, I barely had time
to get everything set up


572
00:48:48.608 --> 00:48:50.654
at every venue we were at.

573
00:48:54.658 --> 00:48:57.139
I knew that he had been
performing electric,


574
00:48:57.313 --> 00:49:00.533
but I had no idea
that the second half


575
00:49:00.708 --> 00:49:02.971
was going to be
what it turned out to be.


576
00:49:23.513 --> 00:49:24.819
Richard.

577
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:29.432
Everybody knew that they
came to see the Bob Dylan


578
00:49:29.606 --> 00:49:31.347
that they were expecting.

579
00:49:31.521 --> 00:49:35.177
Rock 'n' roll was something
that no one expected.


580
00:49:37.353 --> 00:49:39.659
There was a lot of booing.

581
00:49:39.834 --> 00:49:41.966
I mean, it was practically
everywhere we went.


582
00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:45.274
The audiences were hostile.

583
00:49:45.448 --> 00:49:49.365
And the band responded to
the hostility of the audience


584
00:49:49.539 --> 00:49:51.410
by playing more aggressively.

585
00:50:07.383 --> 00:50:11.082
The audience reaction,
that was mystifying...


586
00:50:11.256 --> 00:50:13.563
to everybody.
It was mystifying to me.


587
00:50:13.737 --> 00:50:15.826
I can remember, like,

588
00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.047
"Why doesn't everybody think
this stuff is as great as I do?"


589
00:50:21.005 --> 00:50:24.008
The tapings began
when we were in Europe


590
00:50:24.182 --> 00:50:26.271
because Bob wanted
to make a movie.


591
00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:44.724
He wanted to make
kind of a nouvelle vague movie


592
00:50:44.899 --> 00:50:47.075
of the whole process.

593
00:50:48.903 --> 00:50:50.382
Nobody ever thought
that those tapes


594
00:50:50.556 --> 00:50:53.733
would ever be issued
in the way they're being issued.


595
00:50:53.908 --> 00:50:55.228
All the stuff
that came from Paris


596
00:50:55.257 --> 00:50:57.346
is still being cleared
through customs.


597
00:50:58.347 --> 00:50:59.435
There's nothing here?

598
00:51:02.177 --> 00:51:04.788
- I can't believe it.
- It's a 7:30 show.


599
00:51:04.962 --> 00:51:06.964
- Nothing is there now?
- That's right.


600
00:51:07.138 --> 00:51:09.880
Just the stuff
that was left here.


601
00:51:10.054 --> 00:51:12.143
Two speakers and the organ,
and that's all set up.


602
00:51:12.317 --> 00:51:15.016
The stage is all set up,
but there's nothing else there.


603
00:51:16.756 --> 00:51:19.498
The gear was just the gear
that I was used to using.


604
00:51:19.672 --> 00:51:21.674
It was good microphones.

605
00:51:21.849 --> 00:51:24.242
They were all
individually mic'ed.


606
00:51:24.416 --> 00:51:27.028
There was one microphone
for everybody,


607
00:51:27.202 --> 00:51:29.465
maybe two microphones for Bob.

608
00:51:31.293 --> 00:51:32.294
Thank you.

609
00:51:43.348 --> 00:51:45.394
There wasn't
any theory.


610
00:51:45.568 --> 00:51:50.921
There wasn't any map to follow
about how you mic an electric band.


611
00:52:01.279 --> 00:52:05.327
It was just the way
the music sounded on stage.


612
00:52:05.501 --> 00:52:08.634
There was all one mix,
so I had to compromise.


613
00:52:08.808 --> 00:52:14.510
I mean, most of the concern was about
the music and about the performances,


614
00:52:14.684 --> 00:52:19.167
and the recordings were just
whatever went out into the hall.


615
00:52:19.341 --> 00:52:21.343
We'd all listen
to the tapes afterwards.


616
00:52:21.517 --> 00:52:24.520
I made some changes
and it definitely got better.


617
00:52:25.738 --> 00:52:30.221
He was singing wonderfully
and performing wonderfully,


618
00:52:30.395 --> 00:52:34.443
and the songs were very exciting,
and I was wrapped up in that.


619
00:52:35.009 --> 00:52:36.488
I don't know.

620
00:52:36.662 --> 00:52:38.553
You put good microphones up
in front of good music


621
00:52:38.577 --> 00:52:40.057
and it sounds good.

622
00:53:03.124 --> 00:53:07.258
I mean, obviously, the
musicians played their asses off.


623
00:53:07.432 --> 00:53:10.261
It wasn't even like
the studio recordings


624
00:53:10.435 --> 00:53:13.221
or like the performance
at Newport


625
00:53:13.395 --> 00:53:16.093
because Mickey Jones
was a much louder drummer


626
00:53:16.267 --> 00:53:18.356
and much more
aggressive drummer


627
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:21.881
than anybody else that
had played with him before.


628
00:53:22.056 --> 00:53:24.972
And it drove the music harder.

629
00:53:25.146 --> 00:53:28.540
It made Robbie play
some of the greatest stuff


630
00:53:28.714 --> 00:53:30.412
he ever played in his life.

631
00:53:35.808 --> 00:53:39.595
The Paris show was problematic
for any number of reasons.


632
00:53:49.213 --> 00:53:52.434
You see, my electric guitar
never goes out of tune.


633
00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.962
Bob took forever tuning his guitar,
I think, just to irritate everybody.


634
00:53:59.136 --> 00:54:02.313
He took like 20 minutes
to tune his guitar.


635
00:54:03.314 --> 00:54:07.057
The audience was hostile
from the get-go.


636
00:54:10.147 --> 00:54:11.975
Oh, I love you.

637
00:54:12.932 --> 00:54:14.673
You're all so wonderful.

638
00:54:15.848 --> 00:54:19.156
They had an attitude
about America already,


639
00:54:19.330 --> 00:54:23.508
that we were a bunch
of fascist warmongers.


640
00:54:23.682 --> 00:54:27.077
They opened the second half
with the biggest American flag


641
00:54:27.251 --> 00:54:29.166
that Bob could find in Paris.

642
00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.256
And the audience
didn't get the joke at all.


643
00:54:55.105 --> 00:54:57.238
It was
kind of dismissed.


644
00:54:58.413 --> 00:55:02.460
The recordings
weren't very important.


645
00:55:02.982 --> 00:55:04.680
It broke my heart.

646
00:55:04.854 --> 00:55:07.900
And Columbia just mishandled it

647
00:55:08.075 --> 00:55:09.595
because they wanted to use
their tapes.


648
00:55:09.685 --> 00:55:12.731
And they'd sent
expensive crews over.


649
00:55:12.905 --> 00:55:16.344
And the fact that Bob
wanted to use my recording


650
00:55:16.518 --> 00:55:22.524
was not compatible
with their desires.


651
00:55:22.698 --> 00:55:26.354
I think Grossman told me
to take the tapes to Columbia


652
00:55:26.528 --> 00:55:29.444
and turn them over,
and that was it.


653
00:55:29.618 --> 00:55:30.706
I never saw them again.

654
00:55:32.099 --> 00:55:34.101
I wanted the tapes
to sound good.


655
00:55:34.275 --> 00:55:36.886
I don't know why because...

656
00:55:38.931 --> 00:55:42.326
I didn't know till now that they
would ever become anything.


657
00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:46.722
And I'm glad that it's getting
appreciated after all this time.


658
00:56:30.244 --> 00:56:33.638
The year is 1967.

659
00:56:33.812 --> 00:56:35.814
It's winter in West Saugerties,

660
00:56:35.988 --> 00:56:39.731
a small town about a two-hour
drive north of Manhattan.


661
00:56:39.905 --> 00:56:43.822
Here, Bob Dylan is laid up
recovering from a motorcycle accident,


662
00:56:43.996 --> 00:56:48.349
a canceled tour and the
newfound pressures of fame.


663
00:56:48.523 --> 00:56:51.482
"Escaping the rat race,"
Dylan said.


664
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:54.790
His touring group lived nearby.

665
00:56:54.964 --> 00:56:56.574
They're called The Hawks,

666
00:56:56.748 --> 00:56:59.360
but we'd soon come to know them
as "The Band."


667
00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.372
Together with
Bob Dylan in the basement


668
00:57:11.546 --> 00:57:13.852
of a little country house
called Big Pink,


669
00:57:14.026 --> 00:57:19.249
they start recording originals,
country, folk and rockabilly classics,


670
00:57:19.423 --> 00:57:21.556
song sketches and ideas.

671
00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:25.603
Over the course of a year,
they have reels of new songs,


672
00:57:25.777 --> 00:57:28.127
but none of it
would see the light of day.


673
00:57:28.302 --> 00:57:30.521
No, these were demos

674
00:57:30.695 --> 00:57:33.481
made to hand over
to Dylan's publishing company.


675
00:57:33.655 --> 00:57:36.135
Music for other artists
to record.


676
00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:39.138
The cover versions
come almost overnight.


677
00:57:39.313 --> 00:57:42.316
And what happens next
surprises everyone.


678
00:57:49.236 --> 00:57:52.717
The songs,
they spark a public demand.


679
00:57:52.891 --> 00:57:54.545
They want the originals.

680
00:57:54.719 --> 00:57:57.287
Demo tapes recorded
in a country basement


681
00:57:57.461 --> 00:57:59.507
have found a following.

682
00:57:59.681 --> 00:58:01.509
And by 1969

683
00:58:01.683 --> 00:58:05.208
the first bootleg of the modern
rock 'n' roll age appears


684
00:58:05.382 --> 00:58:07.950
calledGreat White Wonder.

685
00:58:13.564 --> 00:58:15.871
The album compiles
the basement recordings


686
00:58:16.045 --> 00:58:19.396
and some lesser known
Dylan tracks into one album.


687
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:21.485
More bootlegs
follow more demand,


688
00:58:21.659 --> 00:58:24.619
and soon an underground
industry is born.


689
00:58:25.228 --> 00:58:27.317
Eventually, in 1975,

690
00:58:27.491 --> 00:58:31.060
Dylan and The Band bend to
the demand for the real deal


691
00:58:31.234 --> 00:58:34.106
and they release
The Basement Tapes.


692
00:58:34.281 --> 00:58:38.589
The record is an instant
success, but you know how it goes.


693
00:58:38.763 --> 00:58:42.985
The fans, they want more,
to hear it all, to know it all.


694
00:58:50.688 --> 00:58:52.603
It's been 47 years

695
00:58:52.777 --> 00:58:55.563
since Bob Dylan and The Band
made that two-hour drive


696
00:58:55.737 --> 00:58:58.130
north of New York City
to Big Pink.


697
00:58:58.305 --> 00:59:03.353
And the fans were still curious
aboutThe Basement Tapes.


698
00:59:03.527 --> 00:59:05.790
Are there more hidden reels
to be discovered?


699
00:59:05.964 --> 00:59:09.707
What do the original recordings
really sound like?


700
00:59:09.881 --> 00:59:15.844
Forty-seven years we've
wondered, and now we get to find out.


701
00:59:48.746 --> 00:59:53.011
In early '68,
this guy calls me up


702
00:59:53.185 --> 00:59:55.623
and we do the equivalent
of a dope deal,


703
00:59:55.797 --> 00:59:57.755
except there's
no money involved.


704
00:59:57.929 --> 01:00:01.542
He surreptitiously hands me
this cassette and said,


705
01:00:01.716 --> 01:00:03.805
"Don't tell anybody
where you got this."


706
01:00:05.284 --> 01:00:06.721
And I take it home
and listen to it


707
01:00:06.895 --> 01:00:08.810
and call up all my friends
and they come over


708
01:00:08.984 --> 01:00:12.291
and we all listen to it,
completely awestruck.


709
01:00:17.558 --> 01:00:19.168
To me,
it's always been the Holy Grail


710
01:00:19.342 --> 01:00:21.518
to actually fondle
the original reel.


711
01:00:21.692 --> 01:00:24.216
To actually... To say,
"Yeah, this is it.


712
01:00:24.391 --> 01:00:26.044
"This is the real thing."

713
01:00:26.218 --> 01:00:28.656
The goal was to get as much
out of the tapes as possible


714
01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:31.485
and to allow you
to be on the stairs


715
01:00:31.659 --> 01:00:33.182
that led down to the basement

716
01:00:33.356 --> 01:00:34.855
so you could hear,
"What are those guys playing?"


717
01:00:34.879 --> 01:00:36.291
You're in the room.
You're right there.


718
01:00:36.315 --> 01:00:38.187
You feel people breathing.

719
01:00:38.361 --> 01:00:42.539
Everything that's been
mythologized or turned into legend


720
01:00:42.713 --> 01:00:44.889
on behalf of what happened
in that Woodstock basement


721
01:00:45.063 --> 01:00:47.022
in the summer of '67 is true.

722
01:00:47.196 --> 01:00:51.200
The history of the reels
themselves. It's like a detective story.


723
01:00:51.374 --> 01:00:54.072
Robbie told me
he remembered Bob saying,


724
01:00:54.246 --> 01:00:57.902
"We ought to destroy this stuff.
We ought to just erase it."


725
01:00:58.076 --> 01:01:01.471
What if we recorded songs
that could never be released?


726
01:01:01.645 --> 01:01:03.212
What would they sound like?

727
01:01:03.386 --> 01:01:04.822
That's what you're hearing.

728
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:11.176
I think The Basement Tapes
stars.


729
01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:14.397
I think there's no question
with that world tour of '65-'66.


730
01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:16.399
They were unbelievably
grueling shows


731
01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:18.967
because, of course,
everywhere Bob went,


732
01:01:19.141 --> 01:01:22.231
he was badly received
by sections of the audience.


733
01:01:22.405 --> 01:01:28.019
At some shows, a large section
of the audience turned on him.


734
01:01:29.673 --> 01:01:31.893
Usually during
the electric set.


735
01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:33.590
This is a folk song.

736
01:01:34.765 --> 01:01:36.941
This is a folk song.
I wanna sing a folk song now.


737
01:01:40.249 --> 01:01:43.861
People did feel that something
had been taken away from them.


738
01:01:44.035 --> 01:01:48.562
Or something beautiful
had been destroyed by Bob Dylan


739
01:01:48.736 --> 01:01:53.958
leaving the music of the people
behind and going for the charts.


740
01:01:54.132 --> 01:02:00.835
It's taken as this outrage, as
this sellout, as this betrayal.


741
01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:02.924
Dylan talked about it
afterwards,


742
01:02:03.098 --> 01:02:05.753
he talked about it
with a sense of great defiance.


743
01:02:05.927 --> 01:02:07.319
Don't you think
your first records


744
01:02:07.494 --> 01:02:09.670
were much better than the ones
that you do now?


745
01:02:09.844 --> 01:02:11.410
Who said that?

746
01:02:11.585 --> 01:02:13.761
The sense of,
you know, "Fuck you.


747
01:02:13.935 --> 01:02:15.826
"This is the music I'm making,
this is the music I want to sing,


748
01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:17.504
"this is the music
I want to play.


749
01:02:17.678 --> 01:02:20.202
"If you don't like it,
stay away."


750
01:02:20.376 --> 01:02:22.813
Didn't you boo me last night?

751
01:02:22.987 --> 01:02:25.009
- I didn't, I didn't. Please, just a minute.
- We didn't boo you, Bob.


752
01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:28.340
Well, I want the names
of all of people that booed me.


753
01:02:28.515 --> 01:02:30.473
First half,
when they're all so quiet.


754
01:02:30.647 --> 01:02:32.997
I'll just break it, right?
I'll play four or five songs.


755
01:02:33.171 --> 01:02:36.827
They just don't make a sound.
All of a sudden, "Boo."


756
01:02:41.615 --> 01:02:44.313
Robbie Robertson, Richard
Manuel, Rick Danko, Garth Hudson.


757
01:02:44.487 --> 01:02:46.881
Levon Helm,
they become Bob Dylan's band.


758
01:02:47.055 --> 01:02:50.188
These guys are now
a band of brothers.


759
01:02:50.362 --> 01:02:52.495
This brings
these people together.


760
01:02:52.669 --> 01:02:54.671
By the time they reach
the United Kingdom


761
01:02:54.845 --> 01:02:59.371
in the spring of April 1966,

762
01:02:59.546 --> 01:03:01.635
they're meeting audiences
that made


763
01:03:01.809 --> 01:03:05.813
the angry audiences they
faced before look like nothing.


764
01:03:05.987 --> 01:03:07.684
This is a war.

765
01:03:07.858 --> 01:03:12.036
People come in organized groups
in order to stage walkouts.


766
01:03:12.210 --> 01:03:15.518
In other words, they're paying
money not to see the show.


767
01:03:15.692 --> 01:03:18.260
We paid to see
a flipping folk singer, not a...


768
01:03:18.434 --> 01:03:19.914
Not a big loser.

769
01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:21.089
Judas!

770
01:03:26.529 --> 01:03:28.009
I don't believe you.

771
01:03:32.056 --> 01:03:33.536
You're a liar.

772
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:35.712
The effects
were apocalyptic.


773
01:03:37.018 --> 01:03:41.109
In Torrance it's July '65,
with people booing him.


774
01:03:41.283 --> 01:03:42.937
You can't do that for a year

775
01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:44.765
without it getting to you
at some point.


776
01:03:44.939 --> 01:03:49.857
Effectively, you can carry on
for so long like that.


777
01:03:50.031 --> 01:03:53.904
But when you get to the end,
there's a crash.


778
01:03:54.078 --> 01:03:56.124
And the crash
can be metaphoric,


779
01:03:56.298 --> 01:04:00.041
or, as proved to be the case
in Dylan's life, literal.


780
01:04:06.874 --> 01:04:10.878
After that long, grueling tour,
he was going to take a break.


781
01:04:11.052 --> 01:04:12.836
June 1st, 1966.

782
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:15.926
He was going to kick back up at
the Yale Bowl on August 2, 1966,


783
01:04:16.797 --> 01:04:18.189
another whole leg of shows,

784
01:04:18.363 --> 01:04:20.670
and Dylan went back
to Woodstock to relax.


785
01:04:20.844 --> 01:04:22.561
They're supposed to be
going back on the road


786
01:04:22.585 --> 01:04:24.761
to promote his new album,

787
01:04:24.935 --> 01:04:27.218
which had only come out a
couple of weeks before the accident,


788
01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:28.547
Blonde on Blonde.

789
01:04:28.722 --> 01:04:30.637
Except Bob didn't want
to go back on the road.


790
01:04:30.811 --> 01:04:34.597
He decides, "I'm not going back
to this crazy life,


791
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:37.948
"at least for a while.
I'm gone."


792
01:04:38.514 --> 01:04:40.559
This is 1966.

793
01:04:40.734 --> 01:04:44.346
He doesn't go back on the road
again till 1974.


794
01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:46.304
That's a long time.

795
01:04:46.478 --> 01:04:48.350
Dylan took a year-a-half

796
01:04:48.524 --> 01:04:51.092
betweenBlonde on Blonde
andJohn Wesley Harding.


797
01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:55.313
People referred to this
as the period of silence.


798
01:04:55.487 --> 01:05:01.537
As if is that this was
some kind of a strange violation


799
01:05:01.711 --> 01:05:04.453
of the rules of time and space.

800
01:05:04.627 --> 01:05:06.934
In record business terms,
it was.


801
01:05:07.108 --> 01:05:10.067
The guy's 25 years old. He's
had this motorcycle accident.


802
01:05:10.241 --> 01:05:13.854
He has to come up
with some sort of a battle plan.


803
01:05:14.028 --> 01:05:16.378
And this is one reason
I find him so infatuating.


804
01:05:16.552 --> 01:05:18.772
I think in a way, he does it.

805
01:05:18.946 --> 01:05:21.862
He knows he wants to regress
but he doesn't know exactly how.


806
01:05:22.036 --> 01:05:23.907
When he finally gets better,

807
01:05:24.081 --> 01:05:25.929
I think it was that point
that Dylan had the moment of,


808
01:05:25.953 --> 01:05:27.824
"What am I doing with my life?

809
01:05:27.998 --> 01:05:32.133
"Could we not stop for a moment
and reassess where we are


810
01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:34.352
"and where I, Bob Dylan,
want to go?"


811
01:05:34.526 --> 01:05:38.269
Dylan is saying, "No, I'm
not giving you a new album.


812
01:05:38.443 --> 01:05:40.968
"No, I'm not going back on tour.

813
01:05:41.142 --> 01:05:42.883
"No, no.

814
01:05:43.057 --> 01:05:46.713
"I've got a note from my doctor
says I don't have to do this.


815
01:05:46.887 --> 01:05:49.716
"I can stay home."
And that's what he did.


816
01:05:54.764 --> 01:05:57.419
This is January '67.

817
01:05:57.593 --> 01:06:02.119
So they have been recording
and Bob had ideas for a film.


818
01:06:02.293 --> 01:06:04.339
Originally, the idea of
getting the guys


819
01:06:04.513 --> 01:06:06.863
to come up to Woodstock
was actually to work on that.


820
01:06:07.037 --> 01:06:08.691
And they're initially
filmed backing.


821
01:06:08.865 --> 01:06:11.607
Tiny Tim singing in the snow
one morning.


822
01:06:11.781 --> 01:06:14.741
And then they continue on
with other things.


823
01:06:14.915 --> 01:06:17.352
And they work on the movie
or they don't work on the movie.


824
01:06:17.526 --> 01:06:21.573
And they're bored.
What are they going to do?


825
01:06:21.748 --> 01:06:24.011
That's the way
these songs came together.


826
01:06:24.185 --> 01:06:27.579
Initially, it was just that,
getting back into playing music.


827
01:06:27.754 --> 01:06:30.191
Not making music,
but playing music.


828
01:06:43.595 --> 01:06:47.556
Initial sessions are held in the
Red Room, Bob Dylan's own house.


829
01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:49.297
And in typical
Bob Dylan fashion,


830
01:06:49.471 --> 01:06:52.082
I can report to you now
that the Red Room wasn't red.


831
01:06:52.256 --> 01:06:55.564
It had previously been red, but it
had been painted by the Dylans.


832
01:06:55.738 --> 01:06:57.914
The point of the Red Room
sessions is


833
01:06:58.088 --> 01:07:00.395
it's where Bob Dylan
starts to get his mojo back.


834
01:07:02.658 --> 01:07:04.939
They got all this equipment
together to record this stuff,


835
01:07:05.052 --> 01:07:07.054
and I can just see
all The Hawks going...


836
01:07:07.228 --> 01:07:11.275
Garth, you know, you could
figure out how that works, right?


837
01:07:11.449 --> 01:07:13.625
Once you set it up,
you can see how it's recording.


838
01:07:27.422 --> 01:07:29.641
Fortunately, in this case,
Garth Hudson


839
01:07:29.816 --> 01:07:34.037
is a very meticulous person who
seemed to be the responsible party


840
01:07:34.211 --> 01:07:36.474
to put the tape recorder
on top of his organ


841
01:07:36.648 --> 01:07:39.608
and a couple of mixers
with microphones


842
01:07:39.782 --> 01:07:42.524
leading in an experiment
how to record.


843
01:07:42.698 --> 01:07:48.008
Red Room tapes. My understanding
is that the microphone was put


844
01:07:48.182 --> 01:07:51.011
on top of a Wurlitzer electric
panel which was being played,


845
01:07:51.185 --> 01:07:53.970
it was like a little broadcast
mic stand without rubber feet.


846
01:07:54.144 --> 01:07:55.885
The mic is picking up
that vibration,


847
01:07:56.059 --> 01:07:57.974
and some of that stuff's
pretty distorted,


848
01:07:58.148 --> 01:08:00.429
but there's still good music
that you can hear through it.


849
01:08:06.983 --> 01:08:09.464
They leave Dylan's house
and they go where?


850
01:08:09.638 --> 01:08:12.119
Well, they're going to go
to where the guys...


851
01:08:12.293 --> 01:08:15.339
There's no female presence,
there's no family.


852
01:08:15.513 --> 01:08:19.169
There's no one to really bother,
so they go to Big Pink.


853
01:08:19.343 --> 01:08:22.999
Rick Danko said,
"You have to understand."


854
01:08:23.173 --> 01:08:25.132
He said,
"This was a club house."


855
01:08:26.307 --> 01:08:27.743
It was wonderful.

856
01:08:27.917 --> 01:08:29.440
Big Pink's
on the side of a hill.


857
01:08:29.614 --> 01:08:31.355
It's calledThe Basement Tapes

858
01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:33.489
because you leave the kitchen
and walk down to it.


859
01:08:44.673 --> 01:08:46.370
And they started recording,

860
01:08:46.544 --> 01:08:50.984
where the lion's share were done
in the basement of Big Pink.


861
01:09:33.896 --> 01:09:38.161
And at some point,
somebody flicks the trigger.


862
01:09:38.335 --> 01:09:42.035
You know, and suddenly
the floodgates open.


863
01:09:43.427 --> 01:09:45.386
It's speculation
when that happens.


864
01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.042
The evidence would appear to be
Tiny Montgomery,


865
01:09:49.216 --> 01:09:51.044
which is one of
the acetate songs.


866
01:09:51.218 --> 01:09:52.915
It's the first one
to be recorded.


867
01:10:23.032 --> 01:10:25.513
And, suddenly, all the imagery

868
01:10:25.687 --> 01:10:28.124
and all the ideas that are gonna
make The Basement Tapes


869
01:10:28.298 --> 01:10:30.735
this extraordinary body of work
come together in one song,


870
01:10:30.909 --> 01:10:32.085
and it's there.

871
01:10:37.307 --> 01:10:40.789
And it kind of opens up the
history of American popular music


872
01:10:40.963 --> 01:10:46.664
in this extraordinary way for
these guys during these sessions.


873
01:10:46.838 --> 01:10:49.580
You come in on the second
line all the time, it's very easy...


874
01:10:49.754 --> 01:10:53.062
Robbie said at one point,
"Bob was very subtle about this."


875
01:10:55.586 --> 01:10:58.154
But he was
taking us to school.


876
01:10:58.328 --> 01:10:59.764
He had prepped for this.

877
01:11:01.679 --> 01:11:04.813
These very sessions
when he would just drop in.


878
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:15.519
He'd come over with something
he wanted them to learn.


879
01:11:15.693 --> 01:11:19.871
Folk, blues, country music,

880
01:11:20.046 --> 01:11:24.137
child ballads,
contemporary folk music.


881
01:11:24.311 --> 01:11:26.487
Bob Dylan was teaching them.

882
01:11:26.661 --> 01:11:28.706
So here are these people.

883
01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.160
They learned
to trust each other.


884
01:11:30.317 --> 01:11:32.536
They can pick up
each other's cues.


885
01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:34.843
Nothing needs to be explained.

886
01:11:35.017 --> 01:11:37.193
They can work out
arrangements together.


887
01:11:37.367 --> 01:11:40.979
They are all speaking
the same language,


888
01:11:41.154 --> 01:11:43.112
and it's their language.

889
01:11:43.286 --> 01:11:45.941
And in a way, that's what
The Basement Tapesare.


890
01:11:46.115 --> 01:11:48.030
It's five people,

891
01:11:48.204 --> 01:11:51.164
later six,
speaking their own language.


892
01:12:19.496 --> 01:12:22.978
Once the dam burst,
I mean, it really burst.


893
01:12:23.152 --> 01:12:25.894
I mean, he just...
He seems to have been


894
01:12:26.068 --> 01:12:29.289
turning out masterpieces
on an almost daily basis.


895
01:12:29.463 --> 01:12:31.943
An acetate
is a recording.


896
01:12:32.118 --> 01:12:36.513
You give it to Jane or Joe so
they can hear the song and learn it.


897
01:12:36.687 --> 01:12:40.082
There were some acetates
made that got distributed


898
01:12:40.256 --> 01:12:42.345
for the purpose of
publishing demos.


899
01:12:42.519 --> 01:12:44.826
I think they decided
to do the acetate


900
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.915
once they'd recorded
a whole slew


901
01:12:47.089 --> 01:12:52.181
of original songs that sounded
great, that they were proud of.


902
01:12:53.226 --> 01:12:55.706
They weren't
just fooling around.


903
01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.491
They weren't just experiments.

904
01:12:57.665 --> 01:12:59.145
These songs are demanding

905
01:12:59.319 --> 01:13:02.191
from the musicians who made
them, "Finish me."


906
01:13:02.365 --> 01:13:04.933
And that's what happens
with Tears of Rage,


907
01:13:05.107 --> 01:13:08.632
I Shall be Released,
Too Much of Nothing,


908
01:13:08.806 --> 01:13:10.330
and so many other songs.

909
01:13:39.315 --> 01:13:41.035
The hits that came out
of The Basement Tapes


910
01:13:41.143 --> 01:13:42.318
were people like The Byrds

911
01:13:42.492 --> 01:13:43.774
and Manfred Mann
and Fairport Convention.


912
01:13:43.798 --> 01:13:44.799
Quinn the Eskimo.

913
01:13:44.973 --> 01:13:46.366
How the guys in Manfred Mann

914
01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:48.411
picked that and pulled it out,
it's great.


915
01:14:08.475 --> 01:14:11.565
You Ain't Going Nowhere is just one
of the funniest things you'll ever hear.


916
01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:15.351
Here is a song that everybody
knows. The Byrds obviously put it out.


917
01:14:15.525 --> 01:14:17.527
It's a single that's been
covered a million times,


918
01:14:17.701 --> 01:14:20.617
and it has that
very, very memorable chorus.


919
01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:22.663
"Whoo-ee, ride me high.

920
01:14:22.837 --> 01:14:25.187
"Today is the day
my bride's gonna come."


921
01:14:25.361 --> 01:14:28.538
And suddenly you hear this version
where he's almost sending himself up.


922
01:14:28.712 --> 01:14:30.540
"You ain't
no bunch of basement...


923
01:14:30.714 --> 01:14:34.240
"You ain't no head of lettuce,
just a bunch of basement noise."


924
01:14:37.417 --> 01:14:39.027
I mean, just, what is going on?

925
01:14:43.423 --> 01:14:45.623
Yeah, they're definitely having
a good time on that one.


926
01:14:53.824 --> 01:14:58.002
The original publishing demos
start to circulate in 1968.


927
01:14:58.176 --> 01:15:00.788
They get bootlegged on vinyl
in 1969.


928
01:15:00.962 --> 01:15:04.792
Two well-meaning long haired
guys in Los Angeles, California,


929
01:15:04.966 --> 01:15:09.623
decided that they would create a
Bob Dylan album of this material


930
01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:13.757
that they had heard, they had
assembled, as Dylan fanatics


931
01:15:13.931 --> 01:15:16.760
that no one else had heard, none
of the general public had heard.


932
01:15:16.934 --> 01:15:21.287
And they created
a very haphazard two-LP set


933
01:15:21.461 --> 01:15:23.114
called The Great White Wonder.

934
01:15:23.289 --> 01:15:27.249
It was the first pop music
bootleg of any real substance.


935
01:15:27.423 --> 01:15:31.384
It was literally just a white cover
that they had a rubber stamp made


936
01:15:31.558 --> 01:15:32.907
that said "Great White Wonder."

937
01:15:33.081 --> 01:15:34.517
And they went... Next.

938
01:15:34.691 --> 01:15:36.693
It's not a great recording.

939
01:15:36.867 --> 01:15:38.758
Some of the basement tape
songs, they're running fast.


940
01:15:38.782 --> 01:15:41.655
They didn't cut the record
particularly well.


941
01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:43.396
But how could they?

942
01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:45.650
They were enthusiastic amateurs
that loved Bob Dylan.


943
01:15:45.789 --> 01:15:48.488
Who would have dreamed
that in Sweden,


944
01:15:48.662 --> 01:15:51.099
a guy took their stuff,
added a couple things


945
01:15:51.273 --> 01:15:53.231
and put out another one?

946
01:15:53.406 --> 01:15:54.600
Who would've known a guy in
New York would have, you know...


947
01:15:54.624 --> 01:15:56.713
And this whole thing was like

948
01:15:56.887 --> 01:16:00.369
throwing a pebble in the placid
lake and the waves go like this...


949
01:16:00.543 --> 01:16:02.763
People start bootlegging
the bootleg.


950
01:16:02.937 --> 01:16:06.288
Almost immediately, and
possibly even simultaneously,


951
01:16:06.462 --> 01:16:09.247
other people who'd
got hold of the full acetate


952
01:16:09.422 --> 01:16:12.207
started issuing
just the acetate.


953
01:16:12.381 --> 01:16:15.471
And the proliferation
was so extreme


954
01:16:15.645 --> 01:16:18.039
that there's no way of
cataloging who was doing what.


955
01:16:18.213 --> 01:16:22.086
It didn't just start
a minor Bob Dylan fan club.


956
01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:24.437
It started a whole
bootleg industry.


957
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:35.970
There was a cover story
inRolling Stone by Jan Wenner


958
01:16:36.144 --> 01:16:38.625
saying Bob Dylan's
Basement Tape,


959
01:16:38.799 --> 01:16:40.975
and that's what it was
referred to, asThe Tape,


960
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:44.718
The Basement Tape, not "tapes,"
should be released.


961
01:16:44.892 --> 01:16:48.939
And he made an argument about
how this music not only was terrific,


962
01:16:49.113 --> 01:16:51.115
it was a different way
of looking at the world,


963
01:16:51.289 --> 01:16:52.334
and it had to be released.

964
01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:54.249
And why in the world wasn't it?

965
01:16:54.423 --> 01:16:55.685
Didn't make any sense.

966
01:16:55.859 --> 01:16:58.209
It was a secret
hidden in plain sight.


967
01:16:58.384 --> 01:17:01.822
All these songs were on the
radio so why not put it out?


968
01:17:02.823 --> 01:17:03.824
Good question.

969
01:17:09.873 --> 01:17:12.310
By 1975,
the band needed a boost,


970
01:17:12.485 --> 01:17:16.663
and I think putting this stuff out
was a way to make that happen.


971
01:17:16.837 --> 01:17:21.276
Plus, the music was obviously
stuff that the world ought to hear.


972
01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:23.321
Even if Bob Dylan said
he didn't understand


973
01:17:23.496 --> 01:17:26.934
why it made the top 10, he
thought everybody already had them.


974
01:17:27.108 --> 01:17:29.458
And Bob agreed
to let them put it out.


975
01:17:29.632 --> 01:17:31.329
I remember
John Rockwell


976
01:17:31.504 --> 01:17:33.810
inNew York Times said
it was the greatest record


977
01:17:33.984 --> 01:17:36.987
of the Western popular
music sphere, period.


978
01:17:37.161 --> 01:17:39.381
That's a paraphrasing.
But he did, he wrote that.


979
01:17:39.555 --> 01:17:41.862
When the two LP-set
came out in 1975,


980
01:17:42.036 --> 01:17:45.474
it should have, in theory, one
might think quench the thirst


981
01:17:45.648 --> 01:17:47.563
of the public for The
Basement Tapes... A-ha!


982
01:17:47.737 --> 01:17:50.392
People are going,
"What the hell is this?"


983
01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:55.658
Probably the two most famous songs
on The Basement Tapes are missing.


984
01:17:55.832 --> 01:17:59.445
I mean I Should Be Released
and Mighty Quinnare not on.


985
01:17:59.619 --> 01:18:03.057
If anything, it was like
putting kerosene on that flame


986
01:18:03.231 --> 01:18:06.539
andThe Basement Tapes myth
got another rocket boost.


987
01:18:06.713 --> 01:18:08.628
Very quickly...

988
01:18:09.716 --> 01:18:11.718
people realized that,
"This isn't it.


989
01:18:11.892 --> 01:18:13.284
"We need more."

990
01:18:13.459 --> 01:18:15.243
"There must be more.
Can't there be more?"


991
01:18:15.417 --> 01:18:17.201
"Sure, there's more.
We hope there's more."


992
01:18:17.375 --> 01:18:18.812
And the fans got out there

993
01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:21.118
and doing their detective work
soon found out


994
01:18:21.292 --> 01:18:23.381
these guys recorded for months.

995
01:18:23.556 --> 01:18:25.476
Anybody else, the two-LP set
would have come out,


996
01:18:25.601 --> 01:18:28.188
"Oh, great, that's what they did.
This is great. Now we've got it."


997
01:18:28.212 --> 01:18:31.172
But the Dylan fans,
they began to dig, dig, dig,


998
01:18:31.346 --> 01:18:33.609
and they found out there was
a lot more stuff done there,


999
01:18:33.783 --> 01:18:36.090
and it took 40-something years,
but here we are.


1000
01:18:42.705 --> 01:18:44.925
Stuff came out
in dribs and drabs


1001
01:18:45.099 --> 01:18:50.060
on LPs that included
tons of other stuff.


1002
01:18:50.234 --> 01:18:54.151
On tapes that people passed
from hand to hand.


1003
01:18:54.325 --> 01:19:00.723
Then in 1986, several reel to
reels turned up recordings


1004
01:19:00.897 --> 01:19:05.467
of Dylan and the band doing
reams and reams of country and folk


1005
01:19:05.641 --> 01:19:09.123
and all this amazing material
that nobody knew about.


1006
01:19:09.297 --> 01:19:12.169
And they came out on two famous
double albums, bootleg.


1007
01:19:12.343 --> 01:19:16.173
Those tapes originally came
from an ex-roadie of the band.


1008
01:19:16.347 --> 01:19:20.700
And then, six years later,
another ex-roadie of the band


1009
01:19:20.874 --> 01:19:23.920
helped himself to another bunch
of tapes that were lying around


1010
01:19:24.094 --> 01:19:27.881
in Garth's locker
and released those.


1011
01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:33.016
Suddenly, the scale of the amount
of material that had been recorded


1012
01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:37.064
becomes more than one
could necessarily comprehend.


1013
01:20:19.541 --> 01:20:23.414
One Too Many Mornings
with Richard and Bob singing.


1014
01:20:23.589 --> 01:20:25.765
The Richard part
has been inaudible.


1015
01:20:25.939 --> 01:20:29.856
You cannot hear it because the
left channel was recorded so low,


1016
01:20:30.030 --> 01:20:32.075
and we're able to raise
and level the channels


1017
01:20:32.249 --> 01:20:36.297
and then get rid of a lot
of the swirl of the hiss on top


1018
01:20:36.471 --> 01:20:38.604
so that their voices
could be equal.


1019
01:20:38.778 --> 01:20:40.475
Now, for the first time
on this set,


1020
01:20:40.649 --> 01:20:43.173
you can hear Richard and Dylan
sing that song at the same time.


1021
01:20:51.051 --> 01:20:53.967
We finally are getting
the real basement tapes


1022
01:20:54.141 --> 01:20:56.273
because they're
off the real reels.


1023
01:20:56.447 --> 01:20:59.842
And even in the instances
where they can't get access


1024
01:21:00.016 --> 01:21:03.454
to the real reels, nothing is
more than first generation.


1025
01:21:09.635 --> 01:21:11.985
There is one tape
called GHO 1,


1026
01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:16.076
the Garth Hudson 01 reel,
which is the tape that he mixed.


1027
01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:20.080
That was the model that we went
after. To how do you finish them?


1028
01:21:21.472 --> 01:21:23.779
We follow what Garth did.

1029
01:21:28.436 --> 01:21:30.220
It was great
to work with Garth.


1030
01:21:30.394 --> 01:21:33.441
It was great having him be there
and touch it again and bless it


1031
01:21:33.615 --> 01:21:35.748
and give his approval
for it to come out.


1032
01:21:35.922 --> 01:21:39.403
It's great that we've got 30 songs
that haven't been in circulation,


1033
01:21:39.577 --> 01:21:43.669
and some of which are as great
as anything we've previously heard.


1034
01:21:54.157 --> 01:21:57.508
The Basement Tapes
are a masterclass in Americana.


1035
01:21:57.683 --> 01:21:59.510
They help codify it.

1036
01:21:59.685 --> 01:22:01.034
They helped define it.

1037
01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:03.384
This is why
the Americana Acts of today


1038
01:22:03.558 --> 01:22:05.821
all revereThe Basement Tapes.

1039
01:22:05.995 --> 01:22:07.736
It's why I feel
The Basement Tapes


1040
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:10.062
and so many others feel The
Basement Tapes are important.


1041
01:22:10.086 --> 01:22:12.195
If you allow me to say the
inverted commas, "important."


1042
01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:16.005
Certain records and moments
in time are culturally important.


1043
01:22:16.179 --> 01:22:18.660
And the basement in Woodstock
is one of those times.


1044
01:22:18.834 --> 01:22:21.576
These people...
Think about it.


1045
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:23.534
They're looking at the past.

1046
01:22:27.713 --> 01:22:32.065
And they're learning from the
past, and they're listening to the past.


1047
01:22:38.854 --> 01:22:42.771
But the idea that if
the past isn't alive in you,


1048
01:22:42.945 --> 01:22:45.252
then the future will be empty.

1049
01:22:45.426 --> 01:22:47.123
That's what the music says.

1050
01:22:48.864 --> 01:22:50.997
That's what was so different.

1051
01:22:53.303 --> 01:22:59.353
The notion that these guys are

1052
01:22:59.527 --> 01:23:02.182
The "Holy Grail"
as some people say.


1053
01:23:03.792 --> 01:23:05.751
Maybe it's the ultimate bootleg.

1054
01:23:05.925 --> 01:23:08.579
Maybe it because when you talk
about bootlegs,


1055
01:23:08.754 --> 01:23:11.278
what has been more desired
than this?


1056
01:23:44.093 --> 01:23:46.226
Something that
Dylan's had over his career,


1057
01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:48.520
he tries these things,
everybody goes, "I don't know."


1058
01:23:48.663 --> 01:23:50.447
And he does it and we get it.

1059
01:23:50.621 --> 01:23:52.536
We go, "Absolutely."

1060
01:23:52.710 --> 01:23:55.539
I don't see him
attempting to reinvent himself.


1061
01:23:55.713 --> 01:23:57.367
People say that, you know.

1062
01:23:57.541 --> 01:23:59.543
But I don't see that.

1063
01:23:59.717 --> 01:24:02.317
I see him writing songs and going,
"What kind of songs do I have?"


1064
01:24:02.459 --> 01:24:05.767
Bob Dylan came from New York
to recordJohn Wesley Harding


1065
01:24:05.941 --> 01:24:10.990
and Nashville Skyline,
and it was a revolution.


1066
01:24:25.613 --> 01:24:29.660
It was a revolution
in music, in attitude


1067
01:24:29.835 --> 01:24:33.316
and understanding
how incredibly powerful


1068
01:24:33.490 --> 01:24:38.104
the cross pollination of
country and folk and rock was,


1069
01:24:39.018 --> 01:24:41.368
and natural for the time.

1070
01:24:44.197 --> 01:24:49.028
Here was a guy who was,
in his way, a revolutionary.


1071
01:24:49.202 --> 01:24:54.424
Bob had an enormous impact on
what was going on in Nashville.


1072
01:24:54.598 --> 01:24:57.819
He was following his instincts
to seek out these musicians


1073
01:24:57.993 --> 01:25:00.039
because it was inspiring to him.

1074
01:25:07.481 --> 01:25:09.309
A soon as I heard Dylan,

1075
01:25:09.483 --> 01:25:13.226
I realized that he needed
country background.


1076
01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:16.751
He needed the kind of musicians
we didn't have in New York.


1077
01:25:16.925 --> 01:25:19.841
The kind of people who work
with people like Johnny Cash.


1078
01:25:20.015 --> 01:25:24.324
Dad carried a record player
on the road with him on tour


1079
01:25:24.498 --> 01:25:28.371
and before his shows,
he would play Bob every night.


1080
01:25:28.545 --> 01:25:32.593
Bob was a fan of dad's, too,
to that famous line


1081
01:25:32.767 --> 01:25:34.987
of you heard him
coming out of the radio.


1082
01:25:35.161 --> 01:25:37.685
It was like a voice
from middle Earth.


1083
01:25:37.859 --> 01:25:40.166
Johnny Cash was the epitome
of country music.


1084
01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:43.386
He was the living
ultimate end.


1085
01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:47.521
He and I, we were writing each
other letters before we'd ever met.


1086
01:25:47.695 --> 01:25:50.524
First time I met him was at
the Newport Folk Festival.


1087
01:25:50.698 --> 01:25:53.875
He was an early supporter
of mine, told me so.


1088
01:25:54.049 --> 01:25:56.443
But I have been a fan of his
long before that.


1089
01:25:56.617 --> 01:26:00.012
Then one night, Bob Johnston
brought Bob Dylan to Nashville.


1090
01:26:00.186 --> 01:26:03.580
I had Dylan there,
and then I had Cash coming in.


1091
01:26:03.754 --> 01:26:06.366
So when Dylan got through,
Cash walked through the door.


1092
01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:09.151
He said, "What are doing here?"
He said, "I came down to record."


1093
01:26:09.325 --> 01:26:10.805
He said,
"Well, I just finished."


1094
01:26:10.979 --> 01:26:13.286
While he went to dinner,
I built a bar.


1095
01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:16.202
Blue lights,
I had whiskey bottle there,


1096
01:26:16.376 --> 01:26:19.466
clock and shit like that,
their guitars all tuned, ready.


1097
01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.817
Want me to get in closer on it?

1098
01:26:22.991 --> 01:26:25.037
When they came in,
they looked at each other,


1099
01:26:25.211 --> 01:26:27.604
and then they looked over at me
and they started smiling


1100
01:26:27.778 --> 01:26:31.086
and they took their guitars and
they went outside and tuned them


1101
01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:33.871
and started playing
for an hour-and-a-half.


1102
01:26:34.046 --> 01:26:36.222
And what do you want to hear?

1103
01:26:53.717 --> 01:26:57.591
Record company wouldn't
release it because they talked in it.


1104
01:26:57.765 --> 01:27:00.594
And they told me in Nashville,
"If you get a pair of scissors


1105
01:27:00.768 --> 01:27:03.597
"and cut the talking out
of Dylan and him


1106
01:27:03.771 --> 01:27:06.252
"then we can use the music
and all."


1107
01:27:06.426 --> 01:27:09.385
And I said,
"Oh, God, I'm so happy."


1108
01:27:09.559 --> 01:27:11.213
And he said, "Why?"

1109
01:27:11.387 --> 01:27:14.347
I said, "Not to have to be
around you fucking people."


1110
01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:17.785
And I walked out the door
and they still didn't release it.


1111
01:27:17.959 --> 01:27:20.048
And that's the one
they're talking about.


1112
01:27:20.222 --> 01:27:22.877
In Nashville,
their approach is different.


1113
01:27:23.051 --> 01:27:24.748
The negotiations that you make

1114
01:27:24.922 --> 01:27:27.447
with producers and engineers
and studio musicians


1115
01:27:27.621 --> 01:27:30.189
have a different tone and they
move at a different speed.


1116
01:27:30.363 --> 01:27:32.800
These guys
weren't messing around.


1117
01:27:32.974 --> 01:27:36.456
They were so deep musically.

1118
01:28:05.659 --> 01:28:07.400
The John Wesley
Harding record.


1119
01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:09.837
When I worked retail, and I
really discovered that record


1120
01:28:10.011 --> 01:28:13.710
back in the late '80s, early
'90s, that record, I just went...


1121
01:28:14.624 --> 01:28:16.844
I mean, when does it stop?

1122
01:28:17.018 --> 01:28:18.933
When does he stop being great?

1123
01:28:19.107 --> 01:28:20.848
All that country stuff
that he did,


1124
01:28:21.022 --> 01:28:22.782
you listen to the singer,
it's not even the same singer.


1125
01:28:22.806 --> 01:28:24.286
You got that...

1126
01:28:30.249 --> 01:28:32.990
He'd sing in this warm,
beautiful way


1127
01:28:33.165 --> 01:28:34.862
that you've never heard
Dylan sing before.


1128
01:28:40.476 --> 01:28:42.609
When you listen to Lay
Lady Lay you really go,


1129
01:28:42.783 --> 01:28:47.266
"Wow, this is one of the best singers
in the world." His voice is perfect.


1130
01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:50.399
It's beautiful.
It makes you feel every note.


1131
01:29:14.771 --> 01:29:19.298
It's beautiful that it arose out of
mutual respect and friendship.


1132
01:29:19.472 --> 01:29:25.478
That it was again
an authentic organic response


1133
01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:27.480
to what they felt
for each other.


1134
01:29:27.654 --> 01:29:28.698
All right.

1135
01:29:30.483 --> 01:29:32.833
I grew up in the north country,
you know.


1136
01:29:36.576 --> 01:29:38.143
I don't know
if I could do that, John.


1137
01:29:38.317 --> 01:29:42.103
The night that Bob
was on The Johnny Cash Show,


1138
01:29:42.277 --> 01:29:44.845
and he and my dad
sat next to each other,


1139
01:29:45.019 --> 01:29:46.673
I was 13 years old.

1140
01:29:46.847 --> 01:29:48.370
I went to school the next day.

1141
01:29:48.544 --> 01:29:52.766
Suddenly, the coolest

1142
01:29:54.942 --> 01:29:57.727
It's like an explosion
happened in the country.


1143
01:30:31.848 --> 01:30:34.262
Bob Dylan's appearance brought
a great deal of attention to Nashville


1144
01:30:34.286 --> 01:30:36.505
and then a lot of my peers

1145
01:30:36.679 --> 01:30:39.682
did not give him credit for it,
and people to follow who recorded


1146
01:30:39.856 --> 01:30:42.598
songs in Nashville
because Bob Dylan did.


1147
01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:16.850
It must have been
right around 1970.


1148
01:31:17.024 --> 01:31:18.591
I was living in New York City.

1149
01:31:18.765 --> 01:31:21.028
Bob used to come
when we'd play The Bitter End.


1150
01:31:21.202 --> 01:31:22.856
I know that
he'd seen me play there.


1151
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:26.076
I didn't think he noticed me.

1152
01:31:26.251 --> 01:31:31.386
I was introduced to him one night.
We said maybe six words to each other.


1153
01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:34.607
And that was all the personal
contact I had with him until


1154
01:31:34.781 --> 01:31:39.481
he called me one day and asked
me if I would help him try out a studio.


1155
01:31:39.655 --> 01:31:42.702
Trying out the studio turned out
to be recording Self Portrait.


1156
01:31:45.095 --> 01:31:48.316
The studio that I went to was
one of the Columbia Studios,


1157
01:31:48.490 --> 01:31:50.536
so I'm sure he'd been in there
many times before.


1158
01:31:50.710 --> 01:31:52.364
I'm sure of that now,
I wasn't then.


1159
01:31:52.538 --> 01:31:54.017
- Bob?
- Yeah.


1160
01:31:54.191 --> 01:31:55.845
Let's just
take this one. You ready?


1161
01:32:07.814 --> 01:32:09.381
He told me
he wanted to come in.


1162
01:32:09.555 --> 01:32:11.339
Said, "What do you think
about me doing it?"


1163
01:32:11.513 --> 01:32:14.255
The other people saw it.
I said "Great idea."


1164
01:32:14.429 --> 01:32:16.953
It was a good idea
for him to do anything.


1165
01:32:17.127 --> 01:32:18.694
And especially
something like that.


1166
01:32:18.868 --> 01:32:21.436
You never knew
what he was going to do


1167
01:32:21.610 --> 01:32:22.959
or how he was going to do it.

1168
01:32:23.133 --> 01:32:25.179
Bob is always Bob.

1169
01:32:25.353 --> 01:32:28.922
So when we're working on a
session, Bob is specifically always Bob.


1170
01:32:29.096 --> 01:32:33.405
I was there, I think,
for three, four days in a row.


1171
01:32:34.710 --> 01:32:40.150
And it was different than
the other sessions I had done.


1172
01:32:40.325 --> 01:32:44.067
I thought the album would be called
Folk Songs of America or something.


1173
01:32:44.894 --> 01:32:46.113
It was bizarre.

1174
01:32:46.287 --> 01:32:48.898
He wanted to
do folk songs, great.


1175
01:32:49.072 --> 01:32:50.509
I love playing that stuff.

1176
01:32:50.683 --> 01:32:52.293
It's one of
our old favorites.


1177
01:32:52.467 --> 01:32:55.035
Copper Kettlewe recorded,
just the two of us.


1178
01:33:06.829 --> 01:33:09.658
He put his own twist to it,
you know, and it's good.


1179
01:33:22.671 --> 01:33:25.326
He'd play a little bit
and that wouldn't be it,


1180
01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:27.067
then he'd go
into something else.


1181
01:33:27.241 --> 01:33:29.635
That was always Dylan,
ever-changing thing, man.


1182
01:33:29.809 --> 01:33:31.811
He's going, "If this didn't
work, that would work.


1183
01:33:31.985 --> 01:33:33.813
"If this didn't work,
that would work."


1184
01:33:37.382 --> 01:33:39.732
Remember this?
Remember Bob Gibson.


1185
01:33:39.906 --> 01:33:41.864
I think maybe he just
wanted to do a record


1186
01:33:42.038 --> 01:33:44.998
where he was the interpreter,
as opposed to the composer,


1187
01:33:45.172 --> 01:33:48.305
because he wasn't doing
any songs that he wrote.


1188
01:34:12.417 --> 01:34:15.245
It seems to me that
he called it Self Portrait


1189
01:34:15.420 --> 01:34:18.379
because this was the music
that he came out of.


1190
01:34:30.304 --> 01:34:33.176
A lot of the critics didn't want to
hear Bob do anything different.


1191
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:38.225
A lot of the critics wanted Bob to
remain what their idea of him was.


1192
01:34:38.399 --> 01:34:40.401
If he come with another album,

1193
01:34:40.575 --> 01:34:44.144
"Oh, yeah. Let's criticize this
one and see what this is like."


1194
01:34:44.318 --> 01:34:47.800
He knows all that shit. He's been
out there long enough for that.


1195
01:34:47.974 --> 01:34:51.325
They wanted what happened.
They wanted Rolling Stone.


1196
01:34:51.499 --> 01:34:53.066
They didn't want Self Portrait.

1197
01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:54.589
They didn't want
a change of pace.


1198
01:34:54.763 --> 01:34:56.417
They didn't want
a different sound.


1199
01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:58.114
People don't
really speak to you.


1200
01:34:58.288 --> 01:35:00.073
They speak to
their image of you.


1201
01:35:00.247 --> 01:35:02.075
They speak to your name
in caps.


1202
01:35:07.733 --> 01:35:09.430
Some people don't get anything.

1203
01:35:09.604 --> 01:35:12.346
Some people don't get the Bible,
there's a devil or whatever.


1204
01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:14.435
It didn't matter
what anybody saw.


1205
01:35:14.609 --> 01:35:17.003
Some of the people who really
were very critical of it,


1206
01:35:17.177 --> 01:35:19.788
have realized that there's some
marvelous things,


1207
01:35:19.962 --> 01:35:22.051
they just weren't the things
that they wanted to get


1208
01:35:22.225 --> 01:35:23.749
out of a Bob Dylan album.

1209
01:35:23.923 --> 01:35:27.230
Self Portrait, you know,
stood by itself.


1210
01:35:27.404 --> 01:35:28.928
It was very different.

1211
01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:41.462
As far as I could tell,
New Morningwas a reaction


1212
01:35:41.636 --> 01:35:44.813
to the criticism
of Self Portrait.


1213
01:35:44.987 --> 01:35:48.425
It was more like another album,
and it was very comfortable,


1214
01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:51.646
and that's why it was hurried,
if you will.


1215
01:35:51.820 --> 01:35:53.561
But it wasn't really hurried.

1216
01:35:53.735 --> 01:35:56.956
Didn't rush anything. When he
got through, that's when...


1217
01:35:57.130 --> 01:35:58.131
When he said,

1218
01:35:58.305 --> 01:35:59.480
"That's it, Bob,"

1219
01:36:00.263 --> 01:36:01.438
that's when it came out.

1220
01:36:01.613 --> 01:36:04.790
At the time,
there was a brief...


1221
01:36:06.052 --> 01:36:11.013
Flirtation with writing the
songs for a Broadway show.


1222
01:36:11.187 --> 01:36:17.237
I once accompanied him
to Archibald MacLeish's house


1223
01:36:17.411 --> 01:36:20.022
where they had
a discussion about that.


1224
01:36:20.196 --> 01:36:23.896
And it was some sort of
collaboration between the two of them.


1225
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:27.508
And then he decided not to do
that. But he had written the songs.


1226
01:36:27.682 --> 01:36:31.860
That's what comprised
New Morning.


1227
01:36:51.967 --> 01:36:54.361
I was hearing the songs
for the very first time.


1228
01:36:54.535 --> 01:36:57.059
And sometimes
those first times through


1229
01:36:57.233 --> 01:36:58.713
are what was on this album.

1230
01:36:58.887 --> 01:37:01.281
I never heard Bob
do rehearsal with the band.


1231
01:37:01.455 --> 01:37:03.326
He knew what he wanted.

1232
01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:06.765
He didn't necessarily tell us,
but he knew.


1233
01:37:06.939 --> 01:37:08.984
I told everybody,
"Never quit playing."


1234
01:37:09.158 --> 01:37:11.770
If you quit playing, get some
boot briefcase, and your hat


1235
01:37:11.944 --> 01:37:14.686
and go out the door
and wave goodbye at us.


1236
01:37:17.036 --> 01:37:21.301
It's like taking off in a rocket
ship to ever go in with Bob Dylan.


1237
01:37:21.475 --> 01:37:25.261
I was not at the sessions that
George Harrison did with Bob.


1238
01:37:25.435 --> 01:37:30.745
He was very careful about working
out every note that he played.


1239
01:37:30.919 --> 01:37:34.444
Bob is very spontaneous,
and he he wants you to...


1240
01:37:34.619 --> 01:37:37.186
He wants to hear
what your first thought is.


1241
01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:41.103
So the sessions that they did
must have been very different.


1242
01:37:41.277 --> 01:37:48.023
It was nice to hear him improvising,
and I thought I could hear at a point,


1243
01:37:48.197 --> 01:37:53.202
I thought I could hear him
thinking, "What's he doing now?"


1244
01:38:06.041 --> 01:38:07.216
Play it again.

1245
01:38:12.613 --> 01:38:16.791
We had cut New Morning,
and I said to Bob,


1246
01:38:16.965 --> 01:38:20.055
"I have a really good
horn arrangement for this.


1247
01:38:22.144 --> 01:38:23.276
"Can I do that?"

1248
01:38:24.277 --> 01:38:26.322
And he said yeah.

1249
01:38:26.496 --> 01:38:28.257
And I brought in the horn
session for New Morning.


1250
01:38:28.281 --> 01:38:32.807
And he kept just the French horn
playing a downward scale.


1251
01:38:33.503 --> 01:38:34.896
All the rest of it,

1252
01:38:35.070 --> 01:38:36.710
he said, "No, I'm just
going to erase it."


1253
01:38:55.177 --> 01:38:59.573
I'm so delighted that
horns were still there


1254
01:38:59.747 --> 01:39:02.271
so I could mix it, properly.

1255
01:39:02.445 --> 01:39:05.579
Same thing happened with the
strings in Sign on the Window.


1256
01:39:05.753 --> 01:39:09.670
On the original session,
I played an organ solo.


1257
01:39:09.844 --> 01:39:13.892
And my intention was to
take the organ out altogether.


1258
01:39:14.066 --> 01:39:15.066
He kept that.

1259
01:39:16.372 --> 01:39:18.679
And threw all those strings out.

1260
01:39:39.656 --> 01:39:41.484
I love the vocals.

1261
01:39:41.658 --> 01:39:45.837
The way he sings
the word "sleet" is amazing.


1262
01:39:46.011 --> 01:39:48.404
He puts "sleet" in his voice.

1263
01:39:48.578 --> 01:39:54.062
Those two tracks specifically
I've coveted for 40 years.


1264
01:39:54.236 --> 01:39:56.630
And then to find that
I could remix them


1265
01:39:56.804 --> 01:39:58.240
because he didn't erase them,

1266
01:39:58.414 --> 01:40:03.942
it was great to come back to it
and sit at my desk


1267
01:40:04.116 --> 01:40:06.335
and listen to the isolated vocal

1268
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:09.338
and go, "Boy, this is great."

1269
01:40:09.512 --> 01:40:14.343
New Morningl thought was
a great time of his singing.


1270
01:40:14.517 --> 01:40:18.521
I don't think that Bob has gotten
credit for what a great singer he is.


1271
01:40:18.695 --> 01:40:20.610
He is a great singer.

1272
01:40:20.785 --> 01:40:22.221
There's a difference between

1273
01:40:22.395 --> 01:40:24.195
having a great voice
and being a great singer.


1274
01:40:24.353 --> 01:40:27.400
The man can put across a song
like no one else can.


1275
01:40:27.574 --> 01:40:29.315
It just comes through.

1276
01:41:07.483 --> 01:41:11.966
I was very lucky to have been
asked to play on those records,


1277
01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:13.620
and I wouldn't trade it
for anything.


1278
01:41:13.794 --> 01:41:15.143
That's the way it was.

1279
01:41:15.317 --> 01:41:18.712
It was a complete
and utter joyous trip.


1280
01:41:18.886 --> 01:41:23.064
Bob is the equivalent
of William Shakespeare.


1281
01:41:24.022 --> 01:41:26.111
What Shakespeare did
in his time,


1282
01:41:26.763 --> 01:41:28.200
Bob does it in his time.

1283
01:41:28.374 --> 01:41:31.072
You think of all this
huge period of time


1284
01:41:31.246 --> 01:41:33.553
in which he's continued
to deliver,


1285
01:41:33.727 --> 01:41:35.163
it's pretty amazing.

1286
01:41:35.337 --> 01:41:37.687
Down the curve
and around the bend, he came.


1287
01:41:37.862 --> 01:41:41.387
And it'll never end now 'cause
he's been on this roller coaster ride


1288
01:41:41.561 --> 01:41:42.910
ever since he left Minnesota.

1289
01:41:43.084 --> 01:41:45.130
He's been brutalized, sunrised,

1290
01:41:45.304 --> 01:41:48.002
baptized in the waters
of the Village.


1291
01:41:48.176 --> 01:41:51.397
Still, it goes on from Soho
to Moscow to Oslo.


1292
01:41:51.571 --> 01:41:55.314
They speak of this trip,
this battleship who sailed


1293
01:41:55.488 --> 01:41:57.185
in the harbor of Tin Pan Alley

1294
01:41:57.359 --> 01:42:00.536
and sank it with his
Subterranean Homesick Blues.


1295
01:42:01.494 --> 01:42:03.844
There is none but one Bob Dylan.

1296
01:42:45.016 --> 01:42:47.540
When Bob was signed in '61,

1297
01:42:47.714 --> 01:42:51.065
he really changed the whole
image of Columbia Records.


1298
01:42:51.239 --> 01:42:53.807
Columbia was a MOR company.

1299
01:42:53.981 --> 01:42:57.376
It was sing-along with Mitch,
with Johnny Mathis.


1300
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:59.552
It was the tried and true.

1301
01:42:59.726 --> 01:43:05.297
And suddenly Bob came along
with a revolutionary outlook


1302
01:43:05.471 --> 01:43:07.081
for a new generation.

1303
01:43:08.343 --> 01:43:11.259
What's wonderful about
having Bob back now is


1304
01:43:11.433 --> 01:43:15.960
he tried making it
away from the company,


1305
01:43:16.134 --> 01:43:19.398
and he found out
that Columbia was his home.


1306
01:43:19.572 --> 01:43:24.881
And I think the album is going
to prove how different Bob is


1307
01:43:25.056 --> 01:43:27.797
when he's completely comfortable
with his surroundings.


1308
01:43:27.972 --> 01:43:30.409
Than he was, last year.

1309
01:43:30.583 --> 01:43:32.019
I get phone calls every day.

1310
01:43:32.193 --> 01:43:33.673
Reviewers wants to hear it

1311
01:43:33.847 --> 01:43:36.415
and certain retail accounts
where the clerks,


1312
01:43:36.589 --> 01:43:38.591
are aware that it's going on,
have called.


1313
01:43:38.765 --> 01:43:40.810
It's just become everywhere.

1314
01:43:40.985 --> 01:43:42.614
There's a great deal of anticipation
and a great deal of excitement


1315
01:43:42.638 --> 01:43:44.945
about this new
Blood on the Tracksalbum.


1316
01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:47.643
I was in the dentist chair
some morning...


1317
01:43:47.817 --> 01:43:49.428
Some afternoon in May.

1318
01:43:49.602 --> 01:43:51.038
I got a frantic call from

1319
01:43:52.083 --> 01:43:54.955
Owen Stegalstein's secretary

1320
01:43:55.129 --> 01:43:59.046
saying, "John,
Bob Dylan is in the building.


1321
01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:01.440
"Owen wants to know if you
could come right over."


1322
01:44:01.614 --> 01:44:05.487
I said, "I can't come right over.
I'll be over as soon as I can."


1323
01:44:05.661 --> 01:44:10.405
I guess they called me
because some 13 years ago,


1324
01:44:10.579 --> 01:44:13.060
I was the guy who
sort of stuck my neck out


1325
01:44:13.234 --> 01:44:16.542
and signed Bobby
originally to Columbia.


1326
01:44:16.716 --> 01:44:19.371
And they thought it might be
a nice idea if I were around


1327
01:44:19.545 --> 01:44:22.243
at some certain point
in this thing, so...


1328
01:44:23.331 --> 01:44:26.856
I got back to the office
about 45 minutes later.


1329
01:44:27.031 --> 01:44:30.295
And Bobby and Owen
were just finishing


1330
01:44:30.469 --> 01:44:36.997
what looked like an extremely
successful and friendly talk.


1331
01:44:37.171 --> 01:44:40.348
And they were going into
Goddard Lieberson's office.


1332
01:44:40.522 --> 01:44:45.701
And Dylan has always had a sort
of very special respect for Lieberson.


1333
01:44:45.875 --> 01:44:53.231
And they came in and Bobby
was very effusive with Goddard.


1334
01:44:53.405 --> 01:44:56.190
And Goddard looked up at Bobby
and said,


1335
01:44:56.364 --> 01:45:00.629
"Well, Bobby,
same temple, new rabbi".


1336
01:45:00.803 --> 01:45:05.591
When Bob came into the studio
this time, he was prepared.


1337
01:45:06.331 --> 01:45:09.029
Not only was he prepared,

1338
01:45:09.203 --> 01:45:15.340
he was marvelously certain
of what exactly he wanted to do.


1339
01:45:17.124 --> 01:45:20.997
When I used to record Bob
in '61 and '62,


1340
01:45:21.172 --> 01:45:23.174
it was a very different story.

1341
01:45:24.131 --> 01:45:25.828
Bob would come up,

1342
01:45:26.002 --> 01:45:30.703
he was writing about 11 to

1343
01:45:30.877 --> 01:45:35.751
And every time he had something,
he wanted to put it on tape.


1344
01:45:35.925 --> 01:45:37.362
And it was simple
in those days.


1345
01:45:38.667 --> 01:45:40.278
That was before the time

1346
01:45:40.452 --> 01:45:44.586
when people had to pay
for studio time, editing.


1347
01:45:45.761 --> 01:45:48.460
All the rest of the things
that happen now days,


1348
01:45:48.634 --> 01:45:50.549
and this didn't
cost Bob anything.


1349
01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:53.856
Every time he had
something new,


1350
01:45:54.901 --> 01:45:56.468
I'd put 'em in.

1351
01:45:56.642 --> 01:45:58.687
He was sort of sloppy
about the way he worked.


1352
01:45:59.949 --> 01:46:02.735
We had to build a special guard
around the microphone


1353
01:46:02.909 --> 01:46:05.129
because he popped so many P's.

1354
01:46:05.303 --> 01:46:07.174
Poor George Kanawa,

1355
01:46:07.348 --> 01:46:10.569
who was the engineer
at that time, was going crazy.


1356
01:46:10.743 --> 01:46:15.661
So Bob had to work further away
from a microphone.


1357
01:46:15.835 --> 01:46:20.187
But Bob, of course, was just
absolutely unique, sensational,


1358
01:46:20.361 --> 01:46:22.755
marvelous artist in those days.

1359
01:46:22.929 --> 01:46:24.887
And he turned out to be

1360
01:46:25.061 --> 01:46:30.241
even more of a unique, sensational
and marvelous artist this time.


1361
01:46:30.415 --> 01:46:34.375
Bob's always coming up
with a really unusual surprise.


1362
01:46:34.549 --> 01:46:36.856
On this one, he asked me
to get in touch with Pete Hamill


1363
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:38.988
because we had talked
about liner notes,


1364
01:46:39.163 --> 01:46:42.166
and he said he wanted Pete
Hamill to write the liner notes.


1365
01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:45.778
And we made
some maneuvers to contact Pete.


1366
01:46:45.952 --> 01:46:47.475
It was a little difficult
at first.


1367
01:46:47.649 --> 01:46:49.477
Bob and Pete
hit it off immediately.


1368
01:46:49.651 --> 01:46:53.655
Pete took notes and wrote
incredible liner notes for the album.


1369
01:46:53.829 --> 01:46:58.660
So, we've got a really unusual
merchandising support there.


1370
01:46:58.834 --> 01:47:00.754
It kind of explains
a little bit about the music,


1371
01:47:00.923 --> 01:47:04.971
a little bit about the society
in which we live.


1372
01:47:05.145 --> 01:47:08.279
And Bob's music
is kind of a portrait on life.


1373
01:47:08.453 --> 01:47:10.846
He covers so many areas
of music.


1374
01:47:11.020 --> 01:47:14.807
For example, his hard blues
numbers like Meet Me in the Morning.


1375
01:47:14.981 --> 01:47:16.504
Part of the album is acoustic.

1376
01:47:16.678 --> 01:47:19.159
Part of it has
Eric Weissberg's band.


1377
01:47:19.333 --> 01:47:22.597
On a few cuts,
Buddy Cage from the New Riders


1378
01:47:22.771 --> 01:47:24.556
plays steel guitar.

1379
01:47:24.730 --> 01:47:26.993
And as a matter of fact,
we should touch on


1380
01:47:27.167 --> 01:47:28.734
some things
that John had talked about,


1381
01:47:28.908 --> 01:47:31.302
with other musicians
or artists doing Bob's music.


1382
01:47:31.476 --> 01:47:34.348
The New Riders
have recorded You Angel You.


1383
01:47:34.522 --> 01:47:36.611
They used Bob's rough lyric,

1384
01:47:36.785 --> 01:47:39.832
as opposed to his finished lyric
on the Planet Wavealbum.


1385
01:47:40.006 --> 01:47:42.051
But they did a Dylan tune.

1386
01:47:42.226 --> 01:47:45.533
Dave Mason recorded
All Along the Watchtower.


1387
01:47:45.707 --> 01:47:49.363
And Richie Havens,
Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.


1388
01:47:49.537 --> 01:47:51.757
So people are still
recording his music.


1389
01:47:51.931 --> 01:47:54.629
Nothing has changed.
He's evolving, it's all growing.


1390
01:47:54.803 --> 01:47:58.851
And this album, there'll be tons of
songs that people are going to record.


1391
01:47:59.025 --> 01:48:02.637
Many artists will record the
songs in Blood on the Tracks.


1392
01:48:02.811 --> 01:48:04.683
There's a tune
calledldiot Wind,


1393
01:48:05.553 --> 01:48:07.816
which you have to listen to.

1394
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:10.590
You must listen to it several
times to get the significance of it.


1395
01:48:10.645 --> 01:48:13.561
There's a tune, Lily Rosemary
and the Jack of Hearts,


1396
01:48:13.735 --> 01:48:18.000
which touches on some of
the... You know, life is a gamble,


1397
01:48:18.174 --> 01:48:20.220
type of life that we all lead.

1398
01:48:20.394 --> 01:48:23.789
And the conflict
between women, men,


1399
01:48:23.963 --> 01:48:25.269
and just life in general.

1400
01:48:26.095 --> 01:48:28.359
But it kind of
paints a picture,


1401
01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:31.579
a story as it were

1402
01:48:31.753 --> 01:48:33.514
that's very different than some
of the things he's done before,


1403
01:48:33.538 --> 01:48:34.887
and yet it's very familiar.

1404
01:48:35.844 --> 01:48:37.672
So...

1405
01:48:37.846 --> 01:48:40.327
The album has a continuity,
a cohesiveness


1406
01:48:42.198 --> 01:48:43.635
that's exciting.

1407
01:48:43.809 --> 01:48:45.449
And there's an enthusiasm
that just builds


1408
01:48:45.506 --> 01:48:47.943
the difference of having
a little bit of acoustic music


1409
01:48:48.117 --> 01:48:51.991
and a bit of music with a band,
steel guitar, organ, etcetera.


1410
01:48:52.165 --> 01:48:55.603
Kind of creates a contrast
that in itself is exciting.


1411
01:48:55.777 --> 01:48:58.780
I don't think Bob consciously
plans this sort of thing.


1412
01:48:58.954 --> 01:49:02.088
But it came off beautifully,
really came off beautifully.


1413
01:49:02.262 --> 01:49:03.916
Let me tell you
about this album.


1414
01:49:05.091 --> 01:49:06.788
This album,

1415
01:49:06.962 --> 01:49:11.837
unlike any album that's cut
with groups these days,


1416
01:49:12.011 --> 01:49:17.495
was finished in five days
and mixed in two days.


1417
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:20.759
Now this is, you know,
absolutely unprecedented


1418
01:49:21.499 --> 01:49:24.023
the way Columbia works nowadays.

1419
01:49:26.155 --> 01:49:29.071
A Simon and Garfunkel album

1420
01:49:29.245 --> 01:49:33.641
or a Bruce Springsteen album.

1421
01:49:33.815 --> 01:49:36.252
This is six or seven months
in a studio


1422
01:49:36.427 --> 01:49:39.778
of, you know, experimentation,

1423
01:49:41.997 --> 01:49:45.653
of discarding this,
adding that, overdubbing.


1424
01:49:46.262 --> 01:49:47.829
None of that with Bob.

1425
01:49:48.003 --> 01:49:50.832
And this album has a flow

1426
01:49:51.006 --> 01:49:55.010
that you won't find in any other
album recorded in 1974.


1427
01:49:55.184 --> 01:49:57.970
The album cover
is a cover that


1428
01:49:58.144 --> 01:50:02.714
lends itself to everything,
the merchandiser's dream.


1429
01:50:02.888 --> 01:50:07.588
His name is big, the title is big.
He has liner notes on the package.


1430
01:50:07.762 --> 01:50:11.331
We're going to be ready
with point of purchase support


1431
01:50:11.505 --> 01:50:13.464
before the album ships.

1432
01:50:13.638 --> 01:50:15.640
We'll have time-buys
ready to run


1433
01:50:15.814 --> 01:50:18.207
the day the album
hits the stores.


1434
01:50:18.382 --> 01:50:19.644
We'll have all our print ads.

1435
01:50:19.818 --> 01:50:23.082
We've really done a job
up-front on this album


1436
01:50:23.256 --> 01:50:27.391
because Bob has allowed us the
time in a very professional...


1437
01:50:28.914 --> 01:50:31.482
"Professional enthusiasm,"
I think, might be a good phrase.


1438
01:50:31.656 --> 01:50:33.309
He just loves being back,

1439
01:50:33.484 --> 01:50:35.660
and he just knows
that we can do the job for him,


1440
01:50:35.834 --> 01:50:38.140
and it's going to be
really exciting.


1441
01:50:38.314 --> 01:50:40.055
And you'll get to
hear the album.


1442
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:41.709
And when you hear the album,

1443
01:50:41.883 --> 01:50:44.364
you know everything
that John and I have said


1444
01:50:44.538 --> 01:50:47.541
relates to an exciting future
with Bob Dylan.


1445
01:50:47.715 --> 01:50:49.848
This album, of course,
will get immediate airplay.


1446
01:50:50.022 --> 01:50:51.893
That's not unusual for Bob.

1447
01:50:52.067 --> 01:50:53.808
I think where
the difference comes here


1448
01:50:53.982 --> 01:50:57.029
is this album will stay
on the air for quite a while.


1449
01:50:57.203 --> 01:50:59.684
And it's certainly accessible
to Top 40 radio.


1450
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:03.078
Part of this

1451
01:51:03.252 --> 01:51:06.038
enthusiasm for the new release
is generated in the company.


1452
01:51:06.212 --> 01:51:10.521
We've played the tapes for
in-house personnel, of course,


1453
01:51:10.695 --> 01:51:13.437
and Larry Sloman wrote
the interview in Rolling Stone,


1454
01:51:13.611 --> 01:51:15.613
which you've probably
all read by now.


1455
01:51:15.787 --> 01:51:18.746
And part of what Larry talked
about was that this is the Dylan


1456
01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:21.532
that people have been
hungering for.


1457
01:51:21.706 --> 01:51:24.752
So there have been some little
rumbles of apprehension about,


1458
01:51:24.926 --> 01:51:27.538
"How are we going to sell
a new Dylan album?"


1459
01:51:27.712 --> 01:51:30.758
We've seen the problems electors
had the way they handle it.


1460
01:51:30.932 --> 01:51:33.282
I think we're unique.
We handle Bob differently.


1461
01:51:33.457 --> 01:51:35.676
We know Bob
and we understand Bob.


1462
01:51:35.850 --> 01:51:37.635
We know what to do
with his music.


1463
01:51:37.809 --> 01:51:39.769
We know how to handle
the reaction to the airplay,


1464
01:51:39.854 --> 01:51:41.856
and the reaction
in the market place.


1465
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:45.817
So we're going to go
out there well-prepared,


1466
01:51:45.991 --> 01:51:47.819
better prepared
than we've ever been probably,


1467
01:51:47.993 --> 01:51:50.082
and really do a number
with this album.


1468
01:51:50.256 --> 01:51:51.649
And it's going to be accepted.

1469
01:51:51.823 --> 01:51:53.477
People are waiting
for this album.


1470
01:52:03.748 --> 01:52:05.967
Over 2,000 concerts.

1471
01:52:08.404 --> 01:52:10.145
Six hundred songs.

1472
01:52:12.321 --> 01:52:14.019
Forty-four albums.

1473
01:52:16.412 --> 01:52:17.849
Five decades.

1474
01:52:20.199 --> 01:52:21.679
One artist.

1475
01:53:07.376 --> 01:53:08.552
Dylan.

1476
01:53:09.553 --> 01:53:13.992
His greatest songs.
October, '07.
