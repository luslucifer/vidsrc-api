00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:55.052
<i>Ever think back on how
you got somewhere, or why?</i>


2
00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:59.774
<i>Well, my somewhere was an art
town on the edge of the Pacific.</i>


3
00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:05.262
<i>The name of the place didn't matter much.
I just knew I didn't belong.</i>


4
00:01:31.074 --> 00:01:33.976
<i>I was just some loser kid
who ended up here.</i>


5
00:01:34.077 --> 00:01:35.894
<i>By mistake, sort of.</i>

6
00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:41.967
<i>You know, I read somewhere
that nothing is so beautiful</i>


7
00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:44.336
<i>that it can't be ugly
if you look really close.</i>


8
00:01:45.554 --> 00:01:46.738
<i>I can't remember who said it,</i>

9
00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:49.524
<i>but whoever it was
got it right.</i>


10
00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:10.996
That's a good painting, kid.
Really.


11
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:13.832
Thanks.

12
00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:16.235
Can't even see the numbers.

13
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:20.240
How much you, uh...
How much you want for that?


14
00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:23.843
Fifty bucks.

15
00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:27.146
Fifty bucks?
I would've paid double for that.


16
00:02:27.247 --> 00:02:29.799
- Here.
-  Hey!


17
00:02:30.718 --> 00:02:32.836
You, kid!

18
00:02:32.937 --> 00:02:35.772
What are you doing? What are
you doing with my painting?


19
00:02:35.873 --> 00:02:37.741
Wait a minute... Hey!

20
00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.979
- What the...?
- Looks good, huh?


21
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:46.182
Yeah, I'd say it looks good,
I did it.


22
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.424
You in there?

23
00:03:30.928 --> 00:03:33.063
Are you in there?

24
00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:41.555
I let you stay for more than a week.
I want you out of here, now.


25
00:03:43.191 --> 00:03:44.575
Hang on!

26
00:03:45.426 --> 00:03:47.110
I've got your money!

27
00:06:18.834 --> 00:06:22.753
- I feel bad after kicking him out.
- Yeah.


28
00:06:22.855 --> 00:06:24.856
He was here for
a whole week and never paid.


29
00:06:24.957 --> 00:06:28.692
- Really?
- I never did see his mom around.


30
00:06:28.793 --> 00:06:31.896
What do you think he was,

31
00:06:31.997 --> 00:06:34.631
Well, that's why I called you.

32
00:06:34.733 --> 00:06:37.601
Wait till you see
what he did to my room.


33
00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:50.164
Hm... What a mess.

34
00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:54.169
No, not that... that.

35
00:07:17.594 --> 00:07:21.129
- I have a hundred point assignment due.
- Hey! Picasso!


36
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:22.848
See you later.

37
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:26.852
Got any more paintings for sale?

38
00:07:28.621 --> 00:07:31.006
You're the kid who sold the
painting at the mission, right?


39
00:07:34.327 --> 00:07:37.595
Yeah.
How did you hear about that?


40
00:07:37.696 --> 00:07:39.981
It's a small town.

41
00:07:40.633 --> 00:07:42.083
Right.

42
00:07:43.837 --> 00:07:46.238
That's a nice outfit,
by the way.


43
00:07:47.174 --> 00:07:48.791
Thank you.

44
00:07:48.976 --> 00:07:50.743
It's required.

45
00:07:50.844 --> 00:07:54.231
Thank God. I was beginning to
think your grandma dressed you.


46
00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:57.984
- Really?
- Hm-mm.


47
00:07:58.085 --> 00:08:02.622
Well, I had no idea anyone still
thought heavy metal was cool, so...


48
00:08:02.823 --> 00:08:06.625
No, no. See, Black Flag
is punk rock, okay?


49
00:08:06.726 --> 00:08:08.244
- Oh.
- Yeah.


50
00:08:08.345 --> 00:08:10.730
And I'm supposed to take
the word of a con man, huh?


51
00:08:10.831 --> 00:08:14.384
Look, I'm not a con man, okay?
I painted that painting.


52
00:08:15.169 --> 00:08:17.954
Well, part of it, kind of.

53
00:08:19.089 --> 00:08:21.090
How old are you?

54
00:08:21.191 --> 00:08:24.060
- Freshman?
- No, I'm in tenth grade.


55
00:08:24.294 --> 00:08:28.198
- Hm.
- Well, I should be in tenth grade. I'm...


56
00:08:28.298 --> 00:08:30.434
See, I'm working on that.

57
00:08:30.535 --> 00:08:34.438
I don't think you can
talk your way out of this one.


58
00:08:35.373 --> 00:08:37.524
Amber, what are you doing?

59
00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:39.760
Didn't you hear the tardy bell?
Hm?


60
00:08:39.861 --> 00:08:42.029
- Did it ring?
- Yes, it did ring.


61
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.697
- I didn't hear it.
- Really?


62
00:08:43.798 --> 00:08:45.666
Okay, you know what,
are you being sarcastic with me?


63
00:08:45.767 --> 00:08:47.701
- No.
- No. Okay, you know what, let's go.


64
00:08:47.802 --> 00:08:49.270
And young man,
I don't know what you're doing,


65
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:51.605
but you should be in school.
It's after 1:00 p.m. Okay?


66
00:08:51.706 --> 00:08:53.757
- I'm going.
- Yeah, you're going to the principal's office.


67
00:08:53.858 --> 00:08:55.759
- And I'll tell you why...
- Hey, hey, buddy, look.


68
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.994
She said she's going to class,
just give her a break.


69
00:08:58.096 --> 00:09:01.164
You know what, young man? I don't
wanna have to call the police, okay?


70
00:09:01.266 --> 00:09:03.800
So thank you very much.
Take care.


71
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:06.120
You know, why don't you
pick on somebody else?


72
00:09:06.221 --> 00:09:07.204
What did you say?

73
00:09:07.305 --> 00:09:10.091
You hang around
with trash like this?


74
00:09:10.192 --> 00:09:12.226
- Okay, that's it, that's it, we're going right now.
- Ow!


75
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.695
- You need to listen and respect...
- Okay. You don't need to drag me.


76
00:09:14.796 --> 00:09:18.900
No, I am not dragging you. You just need
to respect the school. It's very simple.


77
00:09:19.001 --> 00:09:20.251
Hey!

78
00:09:20.352 --> 00:09:21.953
I said cut her a break,
would you?


79
00:09:22.054 --> 00:09:24.372
Hold on, son...

80
00:09:25.975 --> 00:09:27.542
...over the line here.
You're out of line.


81
00:09:27.643 --> 00:09:29.244
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.


82
00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:31.513
- You need to leave.
- What's up, did you push her?


83
00:09:31.614 --> 00:09:33.948
No, I didn't push her. This guy
grabbed her arm, he's nuts.


84
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.051
Get outta here, you kook!

85
00:09:36.152 --> 00:09:37.819
I was just trying to
make sure she was all right.


86
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.954
- Well, you did that.
- Are you okay?


87
00:09:40.056 --> 00:09:41.740
Yeah, I'm fine.

88
00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.708
- Get back, let's go back.
- Looks like a bum.


89
00:09:43.809 --> 00:09:45.943
- Aram, come on.
- Aram...


90
00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:48.780
- He looks like a homeless dude.
- Hey, let's get outta here, come on.


91
00:09:49.148 --> 00:09:51.933
- Back to school...
- Get as far away as possible. Okay?


92
00:09:52.034 --> 00:09:54.319
- Watch me!
- Hey!


93
00:09:56.355 --> 00:09:58.106
Huh? What now? Huh?

94
00:10:04.531 --> 00:10:05.748
Huh? Huh?

95
00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:08.418
- Huh?
- Hey!


96
00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:10.269
You've gotta stop,
we've gotta go. Come on, guys.


97
00:10:10.371 --> 00:10:12.321
Who was that guy?

98
00:10:12.506 --> 00:10:15.041
- I don't know.
- Let's go. Back to class.


99
00:10:15.142 --> 00:10:18.343
I'm sorry!

100
00:10:20.814 --> 00:10:22.682
- You all right?
- Yeah.


101
00:12:53.186 --> 00:12:54.587
Hello?

102
00:12:55.488 --> 00:12:57.089
Hello?

103
00:14:46.869 --> 00:14:48.770
No way.

104
00:17:42.014 --> 00:17:46.167
Fifteen-year-old juvenile, burglary.
Well, if that's all, Mr. Campbell...


105
00:17:46.334 --> 00:17:48.068
Check his pockets
while you got him.


106
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:49.703
See if he's got some cash
to pay for all this damage.


107
00:17:49.804 --> 00:17:52.073
Everly, you have a call.

108
00:17:52.309 --> 00:17:54.026
Give us a call
if you find anything else.


109
00:17:54.126 --> 00:17:55.644
Believe me, you'll be
the first to hear about it.


110
00:17:55.745 --> 00:17:57.446
I can't believe we got
druggies running around


111
00:17:57.547 --> 00:17:59.314
- in this neighborhood.
- It's an urgent call.


112
00:17:59.415 --> 00:18:01.183
All right.

113
00:18:01.284 --> 00:18:03.134
Excuse us.

114
00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:09.925
What did you do, Bernie?

115
00:18:10.026 --> 00:18:11.893
Wasn't me.

116
00:18:13.412 --> 00:18:16.064
How did this happen?

117
00:18:16.166 --> 00:18:19.568
- I think it was the boy.
- The boy? Are you kidding me?


118
00:18:22.138 --> 00:18:24.673
We only had half
a rough version.


119
00:18:27.326 --> 00:18:29.094
The boy?

120
00:18:29.195 --> 00:18:31.480
Well, it wasn't the maid.

121
00:18:36.202 --> 00:18:38.554
You haven't answered
my question.


122
00:18:40.674 --> 00:18:42.809
In 20 minutes.

123
00:18:46.697 --> 00:18:48.364
What about the next case?

124
00:18:48.465 --> 00:18:51.034
What about it?

125
00:18:51.135 --> 00:18:53.085
Doesn't it deserve your
attention, too?


126
00:18:53.186 --> 00:18:56.772
I give every person who walks through
that door my full attention.


127
00:19:01.178 --> 00:19:05.081
So, did your mother give you any
indication where she was headed


128
00:19:05.182 --> 00:19:10.169
- when she, uh... when she decided to...
- What? Leave me?


129
00:19:11.371 --> 00:19:16.759
Look, she didn't even
bother to say goodbye.


130
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.028
Do you really think
she told me where she was going?


131
00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.686
Joshua, are you an only child?

132
00:19:25.787 --> 00:19:29.489
- What does the file say?
- It's incomplete.


133
00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:35.012
Yeah, well, sounds like me.

134
00:19:35.113 --> 00:19:41.001
I know you know art, but you seem
unaware of my more provocative work.


135
00:19:41.102 --> 00:19:44.438
Major publications
have said my art harkens back


136
00:19:44.539 --> 00:19:49.677
to the work of the original Bohemian
masters who founded this community.


137
00:19:49.844 --> 00:19:52.897
And that's a quote.

138
00:19:52.998 --> 00:19:56.717
So what did I do
to earn this reputation?


139
00:19:56.818 --> 00:20:01.288
I took what the world of art
describes as a master style


140
00:20:01.389 --> 00:20:05.125
and I combined it with my own
interpretation of the intense beauty


141
00:20:05.127 --> 00:20:07.645
of the natural world around me.

142
00:20:07.746 --> 00:20:09.847
The lady from child services
is on the phone.


143
00:20:09.948 --> 00:20:11.450
Bernie, I'm not finished.

144
00:20:12.401 --> 00:20:14.419
They don't speak any English.

145
00:20:16.939 --> 00:20:18.457
Geez...

146
00:20:29.151 --> 00:20:32.804
I don't want to sound negative, but
as we said on the phone earlier,


147
00:20:32.905 --> 00:20:35.056
you're probably wasting
your time coming down here.


148
00:20:35.157 --> 00:20:38.110
- We have a whole process involved.
- I understand.


149
00:20:38.211 --> 00:20:40.579
And I came here,
despite what you said,


150
00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:44.466
because I was really hoping
you might reconsider my offer.


151
00:20:44.567 --> 00:20:48.069
You have a big heart,
offering your home to this kid.


152
00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:53.775
You know, I wasn't... I wasn't exactly
the straightest arrow myself.


153
00:20:53.876 --> 00:20:57.345
I... I think I understand
what this boy's going through.


154
00:20:57.446 --> 00:20:59.315
Well... he has a record.

155
00:20:59.416 --> 00:21:02.969
I'm prepared to
drop all the charges.


156
00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:07.507
Well, I did talk to him this morning. I
mean, he's not a threat or anything.


157
00:21:07.608 --> 00:21:09.291
He's 15 years old.

158
00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:11.761
He's been through enough
as it is.


159
00:21:11.862 --> 00:21:16.615
We do do emergency placements, but
only in extreme circumstances.


160
00:21:16.716 --> 00:21:20.336
What you're asking for is
definitely not standard procedure.


161
00:21:20.437 --> 00:21:22.621
This would be almost impossible
to get past a judge.


162
00:21:22.756 --> 00:21:25.474
Let me worry about that.

163
00:21:25.576 --> 00:21:30.196
I've played enough rounds on Pebble Beach
with these local judges, you know?


164
00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:34.600
Look, Ms. Reese,
I'm an artist myself.


165
00:21:34.701 --> 00:21:36.669
I was very much like this kid.

166
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:39.521
Scared, lost.

167
00:21:39.623 --> 00:21:41.407
The only thing that stopped me
from falling into the hole


168
00:21:41.508 --> 00:21:45.245
that I was rapidly digging
for myself was my talent.


169
00:21:45.346 --> 00:21:47.297
It saved me.

170
00:21:47.398 --> 00:21:50.384
It helped me to be somebody.

171
00:21:50.485 --> 00:21:54.471
- And Joshua, he has that talent.
- I'm not gonna bend the rules.


172
00:21:56.591 --> 00:22:00.460
Ms. Reese,
would you really uphold a rule,


173
00:22:00.561 --> 00:22:04.247
even when you knew it wasn't
in the boy's best interests?


174
00:22:18.212 --> 00:22:19.747
You don't like lox?

175
00:22:19.848 --> 00:22:22.799
Is it... Is it fish?

176
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.819
- Bernie, get the kid some waffles.
- Waffles?


177
00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.321
Or whatever it is kids eat.

178
00:22:33.745 --> 00:22:35.513
I got you a little gift.

179
00:22:35.614 --> 00:22:36.914
Try it.

180
00:22:45.157 --> 00:22:47.374
Yeah, it feels nice.

181
00:22:47.559 --> 00:22:49.793
That's not all you can
do with that, is it?


182
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:56.217
Well, you know, I have done some
reading on a couple of artists.


183
00:22:56.318 --> 00:23:00.855
One named Da Vinci.
He was really good at drawing.


184
00:23:00.956 --> 00:23:03.491
Another guy named Picasso.

185
00:23:03.592 --> 00:23:08.396
But you know,
one of my big favorites...


186
00:23:08.497 --> 00:23:11.499
...this guy named Hank Ketcham.

187
00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.968
Ketcham?
I don't know this artist.


188
00:23:14.069 --> 00:23:19.407
He is the creator of
Dennis the Menace.


189
00:23:26.599 --> 00:23:28.683
I like this kid, I like him.

190
00:23:29.886 --> 00:23:33.122
Dennis the Menace.
That's not bad.


191
00:23:33.223 --> 00:23:37.109
- So it's good.
- I didn't say it was good, I said it was not bad.


192
00:23:39.812 --> 00:23:43.231
The judge asked me to house you in
the hope that you might benefit


193
00:23:43.332 --> 00:23:45.400
from some tutelage from me.

194
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:49.672
Personally, I think you're a born
loser who's gonna squander his talent


195
00:23:49.773 --> 00:23:51.907
before he realizes
its full potential.


196
00:23:52.976 --> 00:23:56.695
Wow. That was some
motivational speech.


197
00:23:56.796 --> 00:24:00.115
Do you have any idea what great
things a professional art career


198
00:24:00.217 --> 00:24:01.450
can give you in your life?

199
00:24:01.551 --> 00:24:04.536
And I care about
that because...?


200
00:24:09.861 --> 00:24:12.812
<i>" Walking on a dream "</i>

201
00:24:12.913 --> 00:24:16.015
A person dedicated to their
craft can have toys like this.


202
00:24:17.351 --> 00:24:20.987
<i>" Talking to myself "</i>

203
00:24:21.088 --> 00:24:23.556
<i>" Will I see again? "</i>

204
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.598
People need to figure out...
how to find their success.


205
00:24:34.719 --> 00:24:37.804
And don't believe
that success is a luxury.


206
00:24:38.506 --> 00:24:41.290
It's a necessity. Trust me.

207
00:25:14.142 --> 00:25:17.444
You must be new
on the charity event circuit.


208
00:25:17.545 --> 00:25:19.747
Oh, yeah.

209
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.668
This is a very poor
use of canvas.


210
00:25:25.003 --> 00:25:27.237
Unless it's yours,
in which case it's...


211
00:25:27.338 --> 00:25:30.708
In which case? Oh...

212
00:25:30.809 --> 00:25:34.579
Everly will be disappointed in
your analysis of his new work.


213
00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:37.114
- Anne-Marie, how nice to see you.
- Hello, Everly.


214
00:25:37.215 --> 00:25:39.718
I see you've met our
young artist-in-residence?


215
00:25:39.819 --> 00:25:42.020
We chatted.

216
00:25:42.121 --> 00:25:45.824
- Anne-Marie, Joshua Mason.
- Hello, Josh.


217
00:25:47.293 --> 00:25:49.494
So, what were you talking about?
Me, I hope.


218
00:25:49.596 --> 00:25:51.597
Oh, actually, we were.

219
00:25:51.698 --> 00:25:56.101
Yes, Joshua was just giving a very
astute analysis of your new work.


220
00:25:56.202 --> 00:25:58.604
Well, he is very bright.

221
00:25:58.705 --> 00:26:00.472
And I feel a lot of this work
is very strong.


222
00:26:00.573 --> 00:26:04.676
I mean, I think I'm entering
a special phase in my career.


223
00:26:04.777 --> 00:26:08.179
- Special is the word.
- Thank you.


224
00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.716
Oh, I've just seen the mayor,
will you excuse me?


225
00:26:13.786 --> 00:26:16.788
Well... it was nice
meeting you, Anne-Marie.


226
00:26:16.889 --> 00:26:18.556
Likewise.

227
00:26:34.207 --> 00:26:35.875
Ryan.

228
00:26:37.711 --> 00:26:41.648
- Joshua.
- Nice to meet you, Josh.


229
00:26:41.749 --> 00:26:44.050
My sister told me
the whole story.


230
00:26:44.151 --> 00:26:48.154
I jumped in the other day without
knowing what was really going on.


231
00:26:50.223 --> 00:26:52.641
Man, you got a mean left hook.

232
00:26:52.742 --> 00:26:55.177
Ooh. Sorry about that.

233
00:26:55.279 --> 00:26:58.047
Hey, you know, your shots were
pretty good, too.


234
00:26:58.148 --> 00:27:00.249
I was feeling that the next day.

235
00:27:02.185 --> 00:27:05.938
Hey, thanks for
backing up my sister.


236
00:27:06.039 --> 00:27:07.189
It means a lot.

237
00:27:08.408 --> 00:27:10.076
No problem.

238
00:27:11.795 --> 00:27:14.565
So, what are you doing here?

239
00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:18.868
I just... I love hanging
out with old people.


240
00:27:18.969 --> 00:27:23.306
Or... two great minds...
think alike.


241
00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:29.212
I saw you talking to Anne-Marie.
What was that all about?


242
00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:32.449
Nothing.
She's just some crazy old lady.


243
00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.451
This town's, like, full of them.

244
00:27:34.552 --> 00:27:37.988
She's actually one
of the pretty cool ones.


245
00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:40.223
- For how famous she is.
- Really?


246
00:27:40.324 --> 00:27:42.643
Yeah. She's crazy rich.

247
00:27:42.744 --> 00:27:45.178
The word is,
she keeps tons of cash.


248
00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.380
That little art studio
by the beach,


249
00:27:47.481 --> 00:27:49.449
- it's like a little cottage down there.
- Yeah.


250
00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.700
Yeah.

251
00:27:51.035 --> 00:27:52.586
Huh.

252
00:29:02.626 --> 00:29:05.527
<i>I don't really remember
what I was looking for.</i>


253
00:29:05.629 --> 00:29:07.596
<i>Maybe it was the money.</i>

254
00:29:07.697 --> 00:29:10.499
<i>At least that would've gotten
me out of that crazy place.</i>


255
00:29:42.867 --> 00:29:44.484
What are you doing here?

256
00:29:44.585 --> 00:29:45.685
Nothing...

257
00:29:45.786 --> 00:29:47.253
What have you got there?

258
00:29:51.459 --> 00:29:53.593
His name was George.

259
00:29:55.012 --> 00:29:57.780
He brought art into this town.

260
00:29:57.881 --> 00:30:02.886
But he didn't have the strength
to stay alive in it.


261
00:30:04.221 --> 00:30:06.189
Why do you have
a picture of him?


262
00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.774
Well, he was
very close to my family.


263
00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:12.879
Very talented and very lost.

264
00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.082
- Oh, your ride's here.
- Is it the police?


265
00:30:16.183 --> 00:30:18.551
Everly.
You live with him, right?


266
00:30:19.404 --> 00:30:20.570
Not by choice.

267
00:30:21.339 --> 00:30:22.606
Oh...

268
00:30:22.707 --> 00:30:24.241
I'm so sorry about this,
Anne-Marie.


269
00:30:24.342 --> 00:30:25.910
Oh, not to worry.

270
00:30:26.011 --> 00:30:29.113
I appreciate your understanding.
Come on.


271
00:30:30.148 --> 00:30:31.849
Why is he living with you?

272
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:36.087
Oh, I've taken him on as
a kind of live-in art student.


273
00:30:36.188 --> 00:30:38.706
It's an alternative
work program.


274
00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:41.442
I had no idea you'd
become so philanthropic.


275
00:30:41.543 --> 00:30:43.677
Well, you know,
we all try to do...


276
00:30:44.612 --> 00:30:46.079
...whenever we can.

277
00:30:51.687 --> 00:30:52.903
Hey, Vanessa?

278
00:30:53.004 --> 00:30:55.606
Um, a Ms. Cole
is here to see you.


279
00:30:55.707 --> 00:30:57.141
Hi, Ms. Cole.

280
00:30:57.242 --> 00:31:00.427
Oh, yes,
I'm here about Joshua Mason.


281
00:31:00.528 --> 00:31:02.762
- We spoke on the phone.
- Great. Well, have a seat.


282
00:31:02.864 --> 00:31:04.098
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.


283
00:31:04.199 --> 00:31:05.665
No, I was just... you know,

284
00:31:05.767 --> 00:31:07.568
wanted to make sure
that he was all right.


285
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:09.670
Well, I've got him
in a wonderful home.


286
00:31:09.771 --> 00:31:11.506
- He's in great hands.
- Uh-huh.


287
00:31:11.607 --> 00:31:13.574
- Yeah.
- Good.


288
00:31:13.675 --> 00:31:17.845
Oh... What a wonderful piece.

289
00:31:17.946 --> 00:31:23.018
- You have an interest in art?
- Oh, well, a little bit.


290
00:31:23.119 --> 00:31:24.753
But I've always
loved children's art.


291
00:31:24.854 --> 00:31:29.174
It doesn't matter who they are or
what they've seen, they use it all.


292
00:31:29.959 --> 00:31:32.077
- Wonderful.
- Well...


293
00:31:32.127 --> 00:31:34.896
...let me show you something
else. Look at these.


294
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:41.802
Oh...

295
00:31:43.539 --> 00:31:45.706
Powerful stuff.

296
00:31:47.193 --> 00:31:50.978
- Are these his?
- They are.


297
00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.832
Those were taken in the motel room
where his mother abandoned him,


298
00:31:53.933 --> 00:31:59.288
- but I'm not allowed to talk about the details.
-  Well...


299
00:31:59.389 --> 00:32:04.377
No, I respect your need for privacy.
I'm a private person myself.


300
00:32:04.478 --> 00:32:06.846
But I do have to
tell you one thing.


301
00:32:06.947 --> 00:32:09.565
Keep your eye on Everly.

302
00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:16.004
He's not right for this.

303
00:32:16.106 --> 00:32:17.706
It's too much
for a kid to handle.


304
00:32:17.807 --> 00:32:20.976
He's 15, he has pimples.

305
00:32:21.078 --> 00:32:24.080
I'm not even sure
his voice has broken.


306
00:32:24.181 --> 00:32:28.967
He probably thinks the Impressionists
are a heavy metal band.


307
00:32:29.069 --> 00:32:31.737
He's talented, but he's a risk.

308
00:32:31.838 --> 00:32:34.407
We need to find someone else
to do the Winslow Homer


309
00:32:34.508 --> 00:32:38.277
- and Dauphine his money now.
- What other choice do I have?


310
00:32:38.378 --> 00:32:40.831
Leeway is dead, Bernie.
He's dead.


311
00:32:40.932 --> 00:32:44.301
He did 20 jobs for us,
but he can't do this one.


312
00:32:44.402 --> 00:32:46.069
Not from the grave.

313
00:32:47.238 --> 00:32:49.106
There's no one to
finish this in time.


314
00:32:50.374 --> 00:32:52.242
Maybe the boy...

315
00:32:54.211 --> 00:32:56.079
- Just maybe.
- That's one hell of a maybe.


316
00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:58.248
- He's got talent.
- Some, yes.


317
00:32:58.349 --> 00:33:00.450
Some? Some?

318
00:33:00.551 --> 00:33:03.953
When you've stopped smoking
crack, call me from planet Earth.


319
00:33:04.054 --> 00:33:05.272
Did you see what he did?

320
00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:09.426
He finished a half-completed
Charles Rollo Peters,


321
00:33:09.527 --> 00:33:12.428
matched his work perfectly.

322
00:33:19.303 --> 00:33:21.304
So how'd you find me?

323
00:33:21.405 --> 00:33:25.943
Well, you know, it's a small town.

324
00:33:28.564 --> 00:33:32.200
- How are things?
- Things are good.


325
00:33:32.301 --> 00:33:35.836
I made up with your brother.

326
00:33:35.938 --> 00:33:40.908
- He was just trying to protect me.
- Yeah. He's cool.


327
00:33:41.009 --> 00:33:45.046
But I do think that
after all my efforts,


328
00:33:45.147 --> 00:33:47.915
that I deserve a kiss.

329
00:33:48.016 --> 00:33:49.650
Whoo!

330
00:33:49.751 --> 00:33:52.787
Slow down!

331
00:33:52.888 --> 00:33:57.125
A kiss for the con man
who punched my brother.


332
00:33:57.793 --> 00:33:59.760
- Yeah.
- Hm...


333
00:33:59.861 --> 00:34:02.663
That sounds reasonable.
It's an idea.


334
00:34:03.932 --> 00:34:06.101
- I have an idea.
- What?


335
00:34:06.202 --> 00:34:12.039
How about you kiss my butt
when I beat you down the beach.


336
00:34:12.141 --> 00:34:15.794
- What do I get if I win?
- Nothing, and you'll like it!


337
00:34:15.895 --> 00:34:17.963
That's not fair!

338
00:34:20.132 --> 00:34:21.867
Whoo!

339
00:34:21.968 --> 00:34:24.954
- Amber!
- I won! Whoo!


340
00:34:25.055 --> 00:34:26.989
I won, I won!

341
00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:29.558
Hey... you dropped this.

342
00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:31.160
I know.

343
00:34:33.245 --> 00:34:34.646
You did that on purpose.

344
00:34:34.747 --> 00:34:36.231
Moi?

345
00:34:36.332 --> 00:34:37.266
Never.

346
00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:39.250
You cheated.

347
00:34:39.351 --> 00:34:40.819
You cheated. That's ridiculous.

348
00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.320
I have played with
cheaters before,


349
00:34:42.421 --> 00:34:43.789
but nothing like that.
That's...


350
00:34:43.890 --> 00:34:46.959
Big men can admit defeat.

351
00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.094
Well, yeah, but I didn't lose.

352
00:34:49.195 --> 00:34:51.180
But you didn't win.

353
00:34:52.115 --> 00:34:53.832
But I got these.

354
00:34:55.535 --> 00:34:56.735
- Give 'em!
- Nope. Nope.


355
00:34:56.836 --> 00:34:58.370
- Give 'em, give 'em!
- Nope.


356
00:35:04.962 --> 00:35:06.345
Give me the keys.

357
00:35:25.283 --> 00:35:27.417
Look at you.

358
00:35:27.518 --> 00:35:29.553
Cute doggy.

359
00:35:31.389 --> 00:35:33.623
Where's your owner? Huh?

360
00:35:36.326 --> 00:35:37.727
Let's see...

361
00:35:42.099 --> 00:35:43.733
Oh.

362
00:35:44.902 --> 00:35:47.638
You're Anne-Marie's dog,
Matilda.


363
00:35:47.739 --> 00:35:51.742
Come on. I'll take you home.
Let's go. Let's go.


364
00:35:51.843 --> 00:35:53.977
Good girl.

365
00:35:54.079 --> 00:35:55.546
Come on.

366
00:36:01.669 --> 00:36:03.304
Let's go.

367
00:36:03.404 --> 00:36:08.408
Hey, I... found your friend,
here, down at the beach today.


368
00:36:08.509 --> 00:36:10.077
- Thank you.
- Yeah.


369
00:36:10.178 --> 00:36:12.663
Oh, you're a naughty girl.

370
00:36:12.764 --> 00:36:14.298
Nah, she's really sweet.

371
00:36:14.399 --> 00:36:15.966
Not when she's hungry.

372
00:36:16.067 --> 00:36:22.039
I just happen to have
freshly-made soup in the kitchen.


373
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.590
Would you like to join me?

374
00:36:25.276 --> 00:36:28.061
Soup... Soup does sound nice.

375
00:36:28.547 --> 00:36:29.780
Come on.

376
00:36:42.561 --> 00:36:45.863
- It was good.
- Would you like some more? Seconds?


377
00:36:45.964 --> 00:36:48.366
Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks.

378
00:36:49.802 --> 00:36:51.670
I have an idea.

379
00:36:51.771 --> 00:36:55.440
While I'm cleaning up, I've got a
great collection of books over here


380
00:36:55.541 --> 00:36:58.559
and there might be something in
there that might interest you.


381
00:37:03.683 --> 00:37:08.002
Oh, and by the way,
I have a spare room out back.


382
00:37:08.104 --> 00:37:10.371
You're welcome to use it
any time you want.


383
00:37:12.274 --> 00:37:14.008
Thanks.

384
00:37:55.369 --> 00:37:58.053
<i>I was wearing cyanide...</i>

385
00:37:58.155 --> 00:38:00.957
<i>...a way out
for all those artists.</i>


386
00:38:01.058 --> 00:38:02.891
<i>But why?</i>

387
00:38:05.628 --> 00:38:08.265
<i>And then, I found the why.</i>

388
00:38:14.973 --> 00:38:20.093
<i>" Every scene is a long dream "</i>

389
00:38:20.194 --> 00:38:24.965
<i>" Give me some colors "</i>

390
00:38:34.925 --> 00:38:40.163
<i>" Every scene is a long dream "</i>

391
00:38:40.264 --> 00:38:45.168
<i>" Give me some colors "</i>

392
00:38:54.847 --> 00:39:00.067
<i>" Every scene is a long dream "</i>

393
00:39:00.168 --> 00:39:04.838

00:39:14.967 --> 00:39:19.287
<i>" Every scene is a long dream. "</i>

395
00:39:19.388 --> 00:39:20.822
The guy makes fakes.

396
00:39:20.923 --> 00:39:25.460
<i>" Give me some colors. "</i>

397
00:39:32.601 --> 00:39:34.535
This place is nice.

398
00:39:34.636 --> 00:39:37.505
Nothing but the best for you.
Thank you, Patrick.


399
00:39:38.239 --> 00:39:40.058
So, Everly...

400
00:39:40.159 --> 00:39:43.111
...I found something pretty
interesting down in your basement.


401
00:39:43.212 --> 00:39:44.680
Oh, what was that?

402
00:39:44.814 --> 00:39:47.199
I think you know
what I'm talking about.


403
00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:53.389
Well, let's just say I do.
Now what?


404
00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.824
You pay me.

405
00:39:57.093 --> 00:39:59.027
Excuse me?

406
00:39:59.128 --> 00:40:03.432
Well, either you pay me or I tell
everybody you're an art forgery dealer.


407
00:40:03.533 --> 00:40:05.517
I see.

408
00:40:05.568 --> 00:40:06.902
You're gonna pay my
way out of this town


409
00:40:07.003 --> 00:40:08.203
or else your little
secret's out.


410
00:40:08.304 --> 00:40:10.322
And what am I supposed
to pay you?


411
00:40:10.456 --> 00:40:14.109
- I was thinking about five.
- Thousand?


412
00:40:16.129 --> 00:40:21.433
I meant 500, but...
yeah, sure, five grand.


413
00:40:21.534 --> 00:40:23.969
What if I told you
I knew how to make millions?


414
00:40:25.639 --> 00:40:27.506
That piece of work
you saw in my house,


415
00:40:27.608 --> 00:40:30.210
do you even know
who the original artist was?


416
00:40:31.895 --> 00:40:33.780
No, I didn't think so.

417
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:38.217
Charles Rollo Peters. One of the
most celebrated artists of his era.


418
00:40:38.318 --> 00:40:43.089
And you matched his exact style.
Effortlessly.


419
00:40:44.124 --> 00:40:46.092
Joshua, you have...

420
00:40:47.728 --> 00:40:49.645
...you have talent.

421
00:40:49.663 --> 00:40:52.949
Capturing what I see has just
always come easy to me.


422
00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.668
I don't doubt it.

423
00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:59.255
So... you can really make that
much money by selling fakes?


424
00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:02.058
If you follow my lead
and don't question me.


425
00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:05.762
- That'll be hard.
- This is real, Joshua.


426
00:41:05.863 --> 00:41:07.497
You've gotta use
your talent for yourself.


427
00:41:07.598 --> 00:41:09.799
No one's gonna be looking out
for you, not even me.


428
00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.585
Are you messing with me?

429
00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:17.441
I've got a job coming up right
now. I could use your skills.


430
00:41:17.542 --> 00:41:19.559
If you pull it off,

431
00:41:19.694 --> 00:41:23.514
I'll split the money
from the sale with you. Cash.


432
00:41:24.999 --> 00:41:27.818
- Seriously?
- Trust me.


433
00:41:29.704 --> 00:41:33.423
Or I suppose I could just go fetch
the 500 bucks you asked me for.


434
00:41:37.596 --> 00:41:41.548
Basically, with the losses
at the Moli gallery,


435
00:41:41.649 --> 00:41:45.286
added to the losses
at the Laguna Beach gallery,


436
00:41:45.386 --> 00:41:48.622
added to the problems
that we're having here,


437
00:41:48.723 --> 00:41:53.794
the overhead is $212,000

438
00:41:53.895 --> 00:41:56.063
for this month alone.

439
00:41:56.164 --> 00:41:59.400
It's hard keeping three galleries
open with so little coming in.


440
00:41:59.501 --> 00:42:02.070
What about the gallery here?
We had a show last month.


441
00:42:02.171 --> 00:42:04.005
We moved two pieces.

442
00:42:04.106 --> 00:42:06.824
It's my birthday party coming
up. You know what could happen?


443
00:42:06.925 --> 00:42:08.727
- I'm fully aware.
- We gotta close this deal now.


444
00:42:08.911 --> 00:42:12.180
- And you think this boy is our best bet?
- I don't know.


445
00:42:12.281 --> 00:42:15.116
All I know is we've
gotta go to San Francisco


446
00:42:15.217 --> 00:42:17.418
and sell that Charles Rollo
Peters to the Emir,


447
00:42:17.519 --> 00:42:19.620
otherwise none
of this matters anyway.


448
00:42:20.723 --> 00:42:22.891
The Peters won't bring in much,
but...


449
00:42:22.992 --> 00:42:25.626
...if I can hook the Emir,
come my birthday,


450
00:42:25.728 --> 00:42:28.546
I'll have him eating
out of my hand.


451
00:42:30.916 --> 00:42:32.851
Every detail matters.

452
00:42:32.952 --> 00:42:35.853
You have raw ability, but you're gonna
have to be more strict with yourself


453
00:42:35.954 --> 00:42:37.405
than you've ever been.

454
00:42:37.506 --> 00:42:40.458
The new work has to match
the original perfectly.


455
00:42:40.559 --> 00:42:42.861
In every detail.

456
00:42:42.962 --> 00:42:46.430
Okay. So what are all these
hammers for and stuff?


457
00:42:46.532 --> 00:42:49.535
Oh, that's for later, when we
age the piece to perfection.


458
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:51.787
- Age it?
- Yeah.


459
00:42:51.888 --> 00:42:53.539
Yeah, you use the mallet
to tap the painting


460
00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:56.209
to develop the craquelure,
the cracks, if you will.


461
00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:58.177
It makes the painting
look older.


462
00:42:58.278 --> 00:43:01.481
Then you fill the cracks with dust,
makes it look all the more real.


463
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:05.418
But first,
we have to find a canvas.


464
00:43:07.254 --> 00:43:10.523
Now this is an inexpensive canvas
from the turn of the century,


465
00:43:10.624 --> 00:43:14.394
painted by an amateur.
Should match perfectly.


466
00:43:28.141 --> 00:43:29.942
What are you doing now?

467
00:43:30.043 --> 00:43:32.111
Stripping it.

468
00:43:32.295 --> 00:43:36.316
Okay, so you paint on a stripped
canvas to help fool the experts.


469
00:43:36.417 --> 00:43:39.069
You take a painting
by a particular artist,


470
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.072
a lesser known work
of little value...


471
00:43:44.409 --> 00:43:45.942
...you strip it...

472
00:43:47.712 --> 00:43:51.615
...and then paint a forgery
of a more valuable work over it.


473
00:43:51.716 --> 00:43:54.184
Wow, I guess you have
this thing down to a science.


474
00:43:54.385 --> 00:43:59.990
Many paintings hanging in
great museums are forgeries.


475
00:44:00.825 --> 00:44:03.127
Really? Like, even famous ones?

476
00:44:03.228 --> 00:44:05.145
You'd better believe it.

477
00:44:05.246 --> 00:44:08.332
Well, I guess sometimes there's more
than just meets the eye with a painting.


478
00:44:08.433 --> 00:44:14.554
Absolutely. In a lab, an oil painting
can be analyzed quite thoroughly.


479
00:44:14.655 --> 00:44:17.123
So we have to make sure
that no infrared


480
00:44:17.224 --> 00:44:20.929
or chemical test
will reveal us.


481
00:44:22.548 --> 00:44:25.266
Well, then I guess we gotta fool
with some pretty serious experts.


482
00:44:25.367 --> 00:44:27.101
Yeah.

483
00:44:27.202 --> 00:44:29.437
One in particular.

484
00:44:36.161 --> 00:44:38.413
It is gorgeous.

485
00:44:38.514 --> 00:44:41.766
Pinkus, we all know
you are the true expert.


486
00:44:41.867 --> 00:44:43.434
What do you say?

487
00:44:47.105 --> 00:44:50.675
I think I can vouch
for its authenticity.


488
00:44:53.545 --> 00:44:56.547
You have done it again,
Everly Campbell.


489
00:44:56.648 --> 00:44:59.700
My wife will love this. You know
how she feels about Peters.


490
00:44:59.802 --> 00:45:02.569
- The only other work she craves for is...
- Winslow Homer, yes.


491
00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:04.705
I saw your wife last month
at Monte Carlo.


492
00:45:04.707 --> 00:45:06.574
I hope she did not get
into one of her moods,


493
00:45:06.675 --> 00:45:08.377
like that time in Kuala Lumpur.

494
00:45:08.478 --> 00:45:11.580
- That was bad, as you may recall.
- I recall, but no.


495
00:45:11.681 --> 00:45:14.082
She was even more beautiful
and more gracious than ever.


496
00:45:14.184 --> 00:45:15.851
Clearly a jewel in your crown.

497
00:45:15.952 --> 00:45:19.838
Ah. Flattery will only...
make you rich.


498
00:45:19.939 --> 00:45:21.706
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- You're welcome.


499
00:45:21.807 --> 00:45:24.576
There is a bank note in there
for quarter of a million.


500
00:45:24.677 --> 00:45:27.295
- The tip is for good customer service.
- You're too gracious.


501
00:45:27.396 --> 00:45:31.166
I know. I want to be sure
we're still working towards


502
00:45:31.267 --> 00:45:36.037
- getting a Winslow Homer?
- I think I may just have found the painting your wife craves.


503
00:45:36.138 --> 00:45:39.825
The rarest Winslow Homer
the world has yet to see.


504
00:45:39.926 --> 00:45:41.894
I have it at home in storage.

505
00:45:41.995 --> 00:45:44.897
I came across it under
the most unusual circumstances.


506
00:45:44.981 --> 00:45:47.849
It's been hidden in Europe
since the first World War.


507
00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.501
How much do you want?

508
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:52.354
- An even ten million.
- Ah...


509
00:45:52.455 --> 00:45:56.193
I assure you, this painting
is going to stun the art world.


510
00:45:58.111 --> 00:46:00.763
- Pinkus?
- Of course, such a painting


511
00:46:00.864 --> 00:46:03.366
would require full
infrared analysis


512
00:46:03.467 --> 00:46:05.001
and a letter of provenance.

513
00:46:05.102 --> 00:46:06.769
If you wish to speak
for the painting,


514
00:46:06.871 --> 00:46:08.338
you're more than welcome
to do a public analysis


515
00:46:08.439 --> 00:46:10.307
at my birthday party.

516
00:46:10.407 --> 00:46:13.376
Then you and the entire world
will see the painting unveiled


517
00:46:13.477 --> 00:46:16.829
and publicly tested
to prove its authenticity.


518
00:46:18.716 --> 00:46:22.418
Pinkus, we will go to Carmel.

519
00:46:33.647 --> 00:46:36.616
I don't know how you do it,
Everly.


520
00:46:36.717 --> 00:46:39.219
We stick to the plan,
the kid finishes the painting,


521
00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:41.655
we send him off to New York,
get him out of Carmel.


522
00:46:41.756 --> 00:46:43.190
What about the police?

523
00:46:43.291 --> 00:46:45.092
We tell 'em he ran away.

524
00:46:45.193 --> 00:46:47.694
He's gonna bring problems.
I can feel it coming.


525
00:46:47.795 --> 00:46:51.232
Bernie, I am tinkering with his life,
but I wish somebody had done it for me.


526
00:46:51.333 --> 00:46:55.702
This kid is screwed up in the
head. He's an emotional wreck.


527
00:46:55.803 --> 00:46:58.839
You know how hard
a life in art is.


528
00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:02.743
Forgery isn't perfect, but he
could make a living at it.


529
00:47:02.844 --> 00:47:06.347
I'm giving him a way so he
never has to worry about money.


530
00:47:06.448 --> 00:47:08.115
Yeah, I'm tinkering,
but the little bastard


531
00:47:08.216 --> 00:47:10.951
- doesn't even know how lucky he is.
- Maybe.


532
00:47:11.052 --> 00:47:14.555
But if we commit to that date,
then we only have a month.


533
00:47:14.656 --> 00:47:16.323
We are committed.

534
00:47:16.424 --> 00:47:20.127
If we don't sell that Winslow
Homer, I lose everything I have.


535
00:47:24.166 --> 00:47:25.599
Everything.

536
00:47:27.035 --> 00:47:30.872
Really high-end forgeries
are the hardest to do.


537
00:47:30.973 --> 00:47:35.877
Some paintings are several centuries
old, they have under-paintings to them.


538
00:47:35.978 --> 00:47:37.745
What's an under-painting?

539
00:47:37.846 --> 00:47:41.216
In truth, it's something you
should not be concerned with yet.


540
00:47:41.317 --> 00:47:45.387
Homer's not known to
have his works painted over.


541
00:47:49.024 --> 00:47:51.259
Are you using
the blue I gave you?


542
00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.528
- Yeah.
- Show it to me.


543
00:47:56.465 --> 00:47:59.301
See, this is the
modern indigo blue.


544
00:47:59.402 --> 00:48:02.204
The pigment in modern oil paint
is not the same as the ones


545
00:48:02.305 --> 00:48:05.207
used in Homer's day.
They're completely different.


546
00:48:05.308 --> 00:48:08.610
Use the Prussian blue
like I told you.


547
00:48:08.711 --> 00:48:10.645
Scrape it off, start over.

548
00:48:18.054 --> 00:48:20.039
You must be Sasha.

549
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.773
Yeah, that's me.

550
00:48:22.676 --> 00:48:24.210
Thanks for coming down.

551
00:48:24.311 --> 00:48:26.845
How'd you get my probation
officer to get me down here?


552
00:48:26.946 --> 00:48:29.081
They owed me a little favor.

553
00:48:30.133 --> 00:48:32.367
Look, um...

554
00:48:32.469 --> 00:48:36.789
...I haven't seen Brynn in... it
must be about three years now.


555
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:39.291
Well, here's a police report.

556
00:48:39.392 --> 00:48:42.762
San Jose.
Says you two were arrested.


557
00:48:42.863 --> 00:48:45.548
Together. October 17th.

558
00:48:46.916 --> 00:48:49.185
Right. There was that.

559
00:48:49.286 --> 00:48:53.072
- Slipped your mind?
- Sure did, yep.


560
00:48:54.208 --> 00:48:56.292
I'm Joshua's case worker.

561
00:48:58.595 --> 00:49:02.816
- How is he?
- Well, Sasha, he's not doing very well.


562
00:49:02.917 --> 00:49:05.319
I've got him placed in a home,
temporarily,


563
00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:10.223
but he doesn't know where his mother
is, he doesn't know why she left.


564
00:49:10.425 --> 00:49:14.043
I haven't been able
to find any family, no friends.


565
00:49:14.144 --> 00:49:16.496
I mean, can you imagine
what's going through his head?


566
00:49:16.597 --> 00:49:20.450
- He's gotta be very confused.
- That's not good.


567
00:49:20.551 --> 00:49:22.235
No, it's not good.

568
00:49:23.454 --> 00:49:25.939
I want you to
help me find Brynn.


569
00:49:26.056 --> 00:49:29.442
Look, I already told you...
I don't know where she is.


570
00:49:29.543 --> 00:49:31.111
Well, you're lying to me.

571
00:49:32.062 --> 00:49:34.414
I don't have to take this.

572
00:49:35.967 --> 00:49:38.668
You're my only chance
to find Brynn.


573
00:49:38.769 --> 00:49:40.420
I'm not the police.

574
00:49:40.521 --> 00:49:43.723
I'm not here
to have her arrested.


575
00:49:43.824 --> 00:49:46.343
I just wanna help Joshua.

576
00:49:49.664 --> 00:49:51.265
He's a great little guy.

577
00:49:51.366 --> 00:49:53.618
Hm-mm. He's a great guy.

578
00:49:53.719 --> 00:49:58.455
Well, that little guy is almost

579
00:49:58.557 --> 00:50:00.191
That her?

580
00:50:06.599 --> 00:50:08.399
Yeah, that's Brynn all right.

581
00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:13.805
Both had bullshit parents.

582
00:50:15.841 --> 00:50:19.960
I talked to a guy recently. He's
a manager at a gentleman’s club.


583
00:50:20.061 --> 00:50:22.013
He said that you two
worked there together


584
00:50:22.114 --> 00:50:24.916
- and that you were waitresses...
- Oh, come on,


585
00:50:25.017 --> 00:50:28.119
you can say it, Ms. Reese.
It won't kill ya.


586
00:50:29.188 --> 00:50:30.871
...as strippers.

587
00:50:31.673 --> 00:50:33.691
So, where is Brynn?

588
00:50:36.563 --> 00:50:38.564
She's probably at her
loser boyfriend's house.


589
00:50:38.648 --> 00:50:40.616
Okay, do you have
an address for me?


590
00:51:06.492 --> 00:51:07.826
Ah!

591
00:51:07.927 --> 00:51:10.011
Are you going
to behave yourself?


592
00:51:11.765 --> 00:51:12.965
Yeah.

593
00:51:14.667 --> 00:51:17.119
All right. Come in.

594
00:51:19.105 --> 00:51:24.944
<i>¶ Christmas lights
around my neck ¶</i>


595
00:51:25.045 --> 00:51:26.996
That's really good.

596
00:51:28.065 --> 00:51:32.168
Thanks.
I had a great face to work with.


597
00:51:33.987 --> 00:51:36.272
Flattery is not gonna
get you out of the doghouse.


598
00:51:36.373 --> 00:51:41.894
We're just friends.
Friends hanging out, talking.


599
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:45.531
- Right.
- Is that cool?


600
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.668
Yeah.

601
00:51:48.769 --> 00:51:51.087
Yeah, but...

602
00:51:51.188 --> 00:51:54.407
But what?

603
00:51:54.508 --> 00:51:59.012
The other day at the beach,
I really... I really blew that.


604
00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.564
Yep.

605
00:52:01.665 --> 00:52:06.469
I missed out on a great opportunity and I just...
the kiss was so...


606
00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:07.671
Awful.

607
00:52:07.772 --> 00:52:10.324
Really awful.

608
00:52:10.425 --> 00:52:11.842
Worst ever.

609
00:52:11.944 --> 00:52:13.127
Worst?

610
00:52:13.862 --> 00:52:15.061
Ever.

611
00:52:15.864 --> 00:52:18.332
Yeah, sorry about that.

612
00:52:18.433 --> 00:52:20.484
Well, I'm here now.

613
00:52:20.586 --> 00:52:22.703
I'm on my best behavior.

614
00:52:22.804 --> 00:52:24.989
I'm just standing here, me,
with the door...


615
00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:27.524
...me and the door.

616
00:52:37.352 --> 00:52:40.137
- Sit.
- Really?


617
00:52:40.238 --> 00:52:42.156
Before I change my mind.

618
00:52:48.363 --> 00:52:50.297
When you kiss a girl...

619
00:52:50.398 --> 00:52:52.133
...you have to be gentle.

620
00:52:52.968 --> 00:52:55.487
- Right.
- Take my hand.


621
00:52:56.455 --> 00:52:59.307
Now kiss my hand, softly.

622
00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:04.363
No, no. On the top of my hand.

623
00:53:05.698 --> 00:53:09.718
Kiss the hand,
then kiss the girl.


624
00:53:09.819 --> 00:53:14.272
<i>" The halo spins. "</i>

625
00:53:16.708 --> 00:53:19.845
- Much better.
- Good.


626
00:53:21.514 --> 00:53:24.449
If only you were
a couple years older.


627
00:53:26.802 --> 00:53:31.106
Yeah, it's funny,
I was just thinking...


628
00:53:31.157 --> 00:53:34.860
...if only you were
a couple years younger.


629
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:38.296
What?

630
00:53:43.337 --> 00:53:45.537
- Oh, Ms. Reese. What a nice surprise.
- Mr. Campbell.


631
00:53:45.638 --> 00:53:47.340
I was in the neighborhood,
thought I'd come by.


632
00:53:47.441 --> 00:53:48.991
You know, I'm just heading out.

633
00:53:49.092 --> 00:53:51.127
I just wanted to talk
for a very quick minute,


634
00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:53.912
- if that's okay?
- Wonderful. You know, tomorrow night at six would be great.


635
00:53:54.013 --> 00:53:55.648
Oh, I meant right now,
just very quickly.


636
00:53:55.749 --> 00:53:57.350
Bernie, is the car ready?

637
00:53:57.451 --> 00:53:59.285
- I was hoping to talk to Josh.
- What was that?


638
00:53:59.386 --> 00:54:02.855
- I wanted to talk to Joshua.
- Bernie, I'll be outside, let's go!


639
00:54:02.956 --> 00:54:05.291
- Uh-huh?
- I'm fine to wait out here for him, it's not a problem.


640
00:54:05.392 --> 00:54:07.794
Would you excuse me just a moment? Hello?

641
00:54:07.895 --> 00:54:10.596
Yeah. Yeah, the papers
are in the car.


642
00:54:10.698 --> 00:54:13.900
Yeah, I'm on my way to
the symposium now. Uh-huh.


643
00:54:14.001 --> 00:54:17.003
Well, I'll... You're gonna have to
work that out with the Japanese.


644
00:54:17.104 --> 00:54:20.323
- Nice to see you, call me later. What?
- No, no... where is Joshua?


645
00:54:20.424 --> 00:54:22.891
He's not here,
he took off this morning.


646
00:54:22.993 --> 00:54:25.294
Wait, we need to talk then.

647
00:54:25.395 --> 00:54:28.364
Yeah, listen,
can I call you back?


648
00:54:29.083 --> 00:54:30.917
Mr. Campbell...

649
00:54:31.019 --> 00:54:33.320
If this is too much for you
to take care of Joshua,


650
00:54:33.421 --> 00:54:35.489
I'm more than happy to find
another home to place him in.


651
00:54:35.590 --> 00:54:37.374
No, no, no.
I've got a handle on this.


652
00:54:37.475 --> 00:54:39.042
It doesn't appear
that way to me.


653
00:54:39.144 --> 00:54:41.344
He's gone right now.
He'll be back.


654
00:54:41.445 --> 00:54:44.114
You know very well
you cannot let him go like that.


655
00:54:44.215 --> 00:54:47.651
You have to be supervising him or he has
to be working for you at all times.


656
00:54:47.752 --> 00:54:49.636
- It's the mandate of the court.
- Yeah, all right, I'll...


657
00:54:49.737 --> 00:54:51.037
This doesn't work for me.

658
00:54:51.138 --> 00:54:53.340
I'll find him immediately,
all right?


659
00:54:53.441 --> 00:54:56.410
Yes, of course, I'm sorry.
You're right, I'm sorry.


660
00:54:56.511 --> 00:54:58.878
Find him quickly, and you have to
call me as soon as you find him


661
00:54:58.979 --> 00:55:00.614
or I will get on the phone
with the judge.


662
00:55:00.715 --> 00:55:02.716
- No, no, no, that won't be necessary.
- Well, I will.


663
00:55:02.817 --> 00:55:05.319
- No, Ms. Reese...
- I'll talk to you soon, then.


664
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:10.557
So you live with Anne
-Marie?

665
00:55:10.658 --> 00:55:13.693
No, I just hang out with her,
she's cool.


666
00:55:13.795 --> 00:55:15.864
Old, but she's cool.

667
00:55:15.965 --> 00:55:18.032
Where's your mom and dad?

668
00:55:18.133 --> 00:55:21.035
Well, I, uh...
I don't really have a dad.


669
00:55:21.136 --> 00:55:24.172
Well, I never really knew him.

670
00:55:24.273 --> 00:55:26.624
- Sorry, I didn't mean to...
- Oh, no, it's cool.


671
00:55:26.808 --> 00:55:28.909
It's cool.
It's a normal question.


672
00:55:29.010 --> 00:55:34.782
And my mom, she... she left me.
Just kind of took off.


673
00:55:34.883 --> 00:55:38.653
That's... that's so scary.

674
00:55:38.754 --> 00:55:42.523
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

675
00:55:42.758 --> 00:55:46.193
At least you found Anne-Marie. I could
see how you two would get along.


676
00:55:46.295 --> 00:55:48.296
Yeah, she's all right.

677
00:55:49.432 --> 00:55:51.533
Do you know who she is?

678
00:55:51.634 --> 00:55:54.001
Yeah, she's like,
some famous artist.


679
00:55:54.102 --> 00:55:57.539
No, no, she's not just famous.

680
00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:00.341
Have you ever
taken art history?


681
00:56:00.443 --> 00:56:01.744
Not really.

682
00:56:01.845 --> 00:56:03.446
All right, well,
I'll tell you this...


683
00:56:03.547 --> 00:56:06.315
Tons of artists would kill
to have a conversation with her,


684
00:56:06.416 --> 00:56:09.117
talk to her about her life,
her art...


685
00:56:09.218 --> 00:56:12.354
Yeah, she is a piece of work.

686
00:56:12.456 --> 00:56:14.723
Well, I think she sees
something in you.


687
00:56:15.926 --> 00:56:17.693
She's got a good eye.

688
00:56:19.496 --> 00:56:22.765
Ah, that's adorable.
I think I'm gonna throw up.


689
00:56:22.999 --> 00:56:24.799
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?


690
00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:28.036
- How's it going?
- Hey. Wanna go surf?


691
00:56:28.137 --> 00:56:30.339
No, dude, I can't even swim.

692
00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.140
- You can't swim?
-  What?


693
00:56:32.375 --> 00:56:33.676
Come on, come on.

694
00:56:33.777 --> 00:56:36.361
Oh, my God, who you
hanging out with? You goony!


695
00:56:36.463 --> 00:56:38.263
We'll get him some floaties.

696
00:56:38.364 --> 00:56:40.716
- No, get him some swim lessons.
-  Yeah, some swim lessons.


697
00:56:40.817 --> 00:56:42.834
We'll throw you in,
see if you can swim.


698
00:56:42.935 --> 00:56:45.237
- I can't, though. I know I can't.
- I bet you can.


699
00:56:57.451 --> 00:56:59.018
Hey.

700
00:57:00.988 --> 00:57:04.657
The lady from
child services came by.


701
00:57:05.559 --> 00:57:07.710
I had to make an excuse.

702
00:57:16.971 --> 00:57:20.423
- Listen, Everly...
- Just shut up.


703
00:57:22.209 --> 00:57:24.077
We got work to do.

704
00:57:24.178 --> 00:57:25.545
Come on.

705
00:58:40.439 --> 00:58:41.873
Here.

706
00:58:43.108 --> 00:58:45.042
It looks good.

707
00:58:46.195 --> 00:58:48.863
Yeah, it's a passable job.

708
00:58:48.964 --> 00:58:51.032
As my dear mother used to say,
"Not bad, not bad,


709
00:58:51.183 --> 00:58:53.068
you can always do better.
Never forget it."


710
00:58:53.169 --> 00:58:56.138
My mom never noticed
I was good at anything.


711
00:58:56.239 --> 00:58:58.506
Hm. Your mother.

712
00:58:58.608 --> 00:59:00.475
I wonder what she's
doing right now.


713
00:59:00.543 --> 00:59:03.011
Probably taking drugs
in an alleyway somewhere.


714
00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.081
Oh, geez, what,
you're gonna cry now?


715
00:59:06.182 --> 00:59:08.301
- Great, that's all I need.
-  I wasn't...


716
00:59:08.402 --> 00:59:10.135
- Forget about your mother.
- I'm trying.


717
00:59:10.236 --> 00:59:12.271
- You gotta let go of all that.
- How can I?


718
00:59:12.372 --> 00:59:14.923
I can't just stop
thinking about it.


719
00:59:15.024 --> 00:59:16.959
Well, she stopped
thinking about you.


720
00:59:18.395 --> 00:59:19.828
She doesn't care about you.

721
00:59:19.929 --> 00:59:21.764
You're gonna have
to look after yourself.


722
00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:27.820
You're gonna be so rich.
You can buy yourself a new mom.


723
00:59:31.825 --> 00:59:35.377
<i>Everything he said was
right, and I hated him for it.</i>


724
00:59:35.479 --> 00:59:40.749
<i>There was only one way to hurt him back.
So, I took the painting.</i>


725
01:00:01.138 --> 01:00:04.908
It's a little overly-sentimental,
don't you think?


726
01:00:05.009 --> 01:00:06.276
No.

727
01:00:06.377 --> 01:00:10.113
- Really?
- Yeah, I like it.


728
01:00:10.214 --> 01:00:12.966
- Is it yours?
- Yes.


729
01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:15.219
Was she an old friend of yours?

730
01:00:16.187 --> 01:00:19.490
Well, she's about like you.

731
01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:22.576
Yeah, I like the colors.

732
01:00:22.677 --> 01:00:24.277
Her cheeks and her hair.

733
01:00:24.378 --> 01:00:25.612
Yeah, that's a technique.

734
01:00:25.714 --> 01:00:28.415
Now, as you are
a student of the arts,


735
01:00:28.516 --> 01:00:33.637
you know that canvases
come in different colors.


736
01:00:33.738 --> 01:00:38.659
So depending on the paints,
what's underneath comes through.


737
01:00:39.594 --> 01:00:40.861
Hm.

738
01:00:40.962 --> 01:00:42.380
I never thought
about it like that.


739
01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.449
Mm-hm.

740
01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:47.685
You know, I was walking
Matilda this morning


741
01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.954
and ran into
some friends of yours.


742
01:00:50.055 --> 01:00:53.057
They're having a party.
Maybe you should go.


743
01:00:53.158 --> 01:00:54.826
Yeah.

744
01:00:54.927 --> 01:00:58.112
Oh, that lovely girl
might be there.


745
01:00:59.148 --> 01:01:02.049
I wasn't really invited to go.

746
01:01:02.151 --> 01:01:05.452
When it comes to girls,
you make your own invitations.


747
01:01:05.553 --> 01:01:08.489
- Come on, go. You'll have a great time.
- Okay.


748
01:01:08.591 --> 01:01:10.357
Yeah, go.

749
01:01:44.461 --> 01:01:47.112
Come inside.
Ryan's playing pool.


750
01:01:47.213 --> 01:01:48.847
Come play pool.

751
01:02:03.846 --> 01:02:04.830
Josh, what's up?

752
01:02:06.399 --> 01:02:07.916
Hey.

753
01:02:09.102 --> 01:02:11.236
Hey! What are you doing, huh?

754
01:02:11.337 --> 01:02:13.405
- Stop! Stop!
- Whoa, whoa!


755
01:02:13.506 --> 01:02:15.875
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?


756
01:02:15.976 --> 01:02:17.977
- Calm down.
- I don't get you.


757
01:02:18.079 --> 01:02:20.947
- Stop it.
- Chill out.


758
01:02:21.481 --> 01:02:23.466
Whoa!

759
01:02:23.567 --> 01:02:26.102
Guys, stop it!

760
01:02:26.203 --> 01:02:28.888
- Stop!
- Stop!


761
01:02:31.559 --> 01:02:34.227
Stop! Calm down!

762
01:02:36.864 --> 01:02:39.315
Whoa, whoa. Stop!

763
01:02:40.735 --> 01:02:43.570
- It's our cousin.
- What?


764
01:02:43.671 --> 01:02:45.305
Keen is our cousin.

765
01:02:46.974 --> 01:02:48.908
Unbelievable.

766
01:02:57.485 --> 01:02:59.469
Oh...

767
01:03:00.471 --> 01:03:02.990
What happened at that party?

768
01:03:03.091 --> 01:03:05.326
I got into a fight.

769
01:03:05.427 --> 01:03:08.061
But you were
only gone for an hour.


770
01:03:08.163 --> 01:03:10.164
I didn't start it.

771
01:03:10.265 --> 01:03:12.333
The other guy did.
He was all over Amber.


772
01:03:12.434 --> 01:03:16.387
Oh. Oh, I see.

773
01:03:17.755 --> 01:03:22.092
So, this is the result
of what you thought you saw.


774
01:03:23.262 --> 01:03:25.529
Yeah, I was really stupid.

775
01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:28.515
No, you're not stupid.

776
01:03:29.785 --> 01:03:32.286
Here, let me explain
something to you.


777
01:03:32.387 --> 01:03:34.388
Take a look at that painting.

778
01:03:36.507 --> 01:03:40.093
Just take a good look at it.
Look at it in this light.


779
01:03:40.194 --> 01:03:41.845
You're not quite sure
what you're seeing,


780
01:03:41.947 --> 01:03:44.815
but it kind of looks
like something.


781
01:03:44.916 --> 01:03:46.600
But...

782
01:03:47.736 --> 01:03:49.705
...the minute I do this...

783
01:03:49.806 --> 01:03:51.740
...it's completely different.

784
01:03:51.791 --> 01:03:55.994
So it has a
completely different meaning.


785
01:03:56.095 --> 01:04:00.181
It's not what you expect at all.
Something different.


786
01:04:00.282 --> 01:04:01.950
What are you really saying?

787
01:04:02.051 --> 01:04:04.385
What I'm talking about is truth.

788
01:04:04.587 --> 01:04:08.056
Truth is about...

789
01:04:08.173 --> 01:04:12.010
...what you do
to get the proper perspective.


790
01:04:16.381 --> 01:04:19.034
Joshua, you know,

791
01:04:19.134 --> 01:04:22.671
I've been thinking
for quite a while now, and...


792
01:04:22.822 --> 01:04:25.173
...I was wondering...

793
01:04:25.274 --> 01:04:27.909
...would you like to
come and live with me here?


794
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:31.997
- Is it my own choice?
- Completely.


795
01:04:33.516 --> 01:04:38.588
- Do you really want me here?
- Yes, I really, really do.


796
01:04:41.458 --> 01:04:46.178
- Maybe, I could.
- Maybe, yes?


797
01:04:46.279 --> 01:04:48.397
Oh... Ah!

798
01:04:48.498 --> 01:04:51.350
It's been such a long time since
I've had a child in my house.


799
01:05:36.213 --> 01:05:37.547
Hello?

800
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.551
Hello?

801
01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:48.459
I'm looking for Joshua Mason's
mother, Brynn Mason?


802
01:05:50.728 --> 01:05:52.495
Brynn?

803
01:06:01.138 --> 01:06:03.840
Is there a Brynn in the house?

804
01:06:05.926 --> 01:06:08.328
You get back here right now, 
I'm gonna beat you!

805
01:06:08.429 --> 01:06:09.530
Whoa!

806
01:06:10.749 --> 01:06:12.500
Who the hell are you?

807
01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:17.939
- Are you Joshua Mason's mother?
- Yeah. So who are you?


808
01:06:19.024 --> 01:06:21.292
Well, what the hell's
going on here?


809
01:06:22.928 --> 01:06:26.430
I... I just asked you...
who are you?


810
01:06:28.834 --> 01:06:32.036
- No. Oh, no, you don't.
- This is CPS.


811
01:06:32.137 --> 01:06:34.989
- I'm talking to you, bitch!
- I have an endangered child. I need a black and white.


812
01:07:05.672 --> 01:07:07.505
Everly?

813
01:07:08.875 --> 01:07:10.475
Everly?

814
01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:24.924
Oh...

815
01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:27.970
Oh, no.

816
01:08:48.193 --> 01:08:50.061
Not again.

817
01:08:51.963 --> 01:08:54.665
I don't think
we've been burgled.


818
01:08:54.766 --> 01:08:56.983
It's probably something worse.

819
01:08:59.987 --> 01:09:01.922
You are scum.

820
01:09:02.023 --> 01:09:03.640
I want you out of my house, now.

821
01:09:03.741 --> 01:09:06.293
I can't believe
you're involving the boy.


822
01:09:06.594 --> 01:09:08.212
Oh, like he has
so many options?


823
01:09:08.313 --> 01:09:10.213
Well, of course he has options.

824
01:09:10.315 --> 01:09:12.716
- But what you do will only hurt him.
- By making him rich?


825
01:09:13.034 --> 01:09:15.871
By stunting his spirit...

826
01:09:15.972 --> 01:09:18.940
...at a moment that he
needs nurturing more than ever.


827
01:09:18.958 --> 01:09:20.976
The way I look at it,
I'm doing him a favor.


828
01:09:21.210 --> 01:09:23.861
As I see it,
you're up to your old tricks.


829
01:09:23.962 --> 01:09:25.997
He's at your house, isn't he?

830
01:09:26.098 --> 01:09:27.632
Maybe.

831
01:09:27.733 --> 01:09:29.200
I don't make his schedule.

832
01:09:29.301 --> 01:09:31.102
Yeah, well,
I want him back here. Today.


833
01:09:31.203 --> 01:09:35.273
We all want things. That doesn't
mean we're going to get them.


834
01:09:36.509 --> 01:09:38.827
Bernie will be picking him up
in 15 minutes.


835
01:09:38.928 --> 01:09:42.381
- He'd better have what belongs to me.
- I'll get the car ready.


836
01:09:42.482 --> 01:09:47.652
Relax, Bernie. Joshua needs
a little more time in bed.


837
01:09:47.753 --> 01:09:50.405
- He's injured and resting.
- Injured?


838
01:09:50.606 --> 01:09:55.343
Don't worry, Everly,
his hands are still intact.


839
01:09:56.628 --> 01:10:00.198
If you wanna get into this now,
just like this,


840
01:10:00.299 --> 01:10:02.334
I'm gonna tell
the whole world about you.


841
01:10:04.454 --> 01:10:07.923
It'll be great, huh?

842
01:10:08.024 --> 01:10:11.227
You without any dignity.

843
01:10:11.328 --> 01:10:14.496
You would take the
only thing I have left.


844
01:10:22.989 --> 01:10:25.691
Now, be very careful
with this one.


845
01:10:27.761 --> 01:10:30.730
- Still not here?
- No. What do you think happened to him?


846
01:10:30.831 --> 01:10:33.700
The little bastard's upset and
now he wants to see us sweat.


847
01:10:33.801 --> 01:10:36.268
Well, he's making
a good job of it.


848
01:10:36.370 --> 01:10:38.103
Yeah, well,
I've still got one more move.


849
01:10:38.339 --> 01:10:40.556
Well, now would
be the time to use it.


850
01:10:43.126 --> 01:10:47.029
Well... this is the call.

851
01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.219
- Hello?
- Everly, how's everything going.


852
01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:55.605
Fine, fine, it's all going well.

853
01:10:55.706 --> 01:10:57.891
I believe the show is
gonna go very, very well


854
01:10:57.992 --> 01:11:00.510
and we'll have everything
settled by next week, Dauphine.


855
01:11:00.611 --> 01:11:03.897
Everly, we are not a bank,
so let me be completely clear.


856
01:11:03.998 --> 01:11:06.834
Next week, you pay the
balance owed to my group,


857
01:11:06.935 --> 01:11:10.103
or you turn over your
entire holdings to us.


858
01:11:10.204 --> 01:11:13.940
Every house, every gallery,
every car, everything.


859
01:11:14.041 --> 01:11:16.827
No more extensions.

860
01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.697
Bernie, I want you to get
in your car and find that kid.


861
01:11:20.865 --> 01:11:22.499
- Well, I...
- Just find him!


862
01:11:26.988 --> 01:11:28.755
That's a good girl.

863
01:11:32.293 --> 01:11:34.311
What's up? Hm?

864
01:11:34.412 --> 01:11:37.381
Look, I don't
want any trouble, okay?


865
01:11:37.383 --> 01:11:38.933
I'm just messing with ya.

866
01:11:40.269 --> 01:11:43.504
Look, man, I'm sorry, okay?

867
01:11:43.605 --> 01:11:44.905
I was really stupid.

868
01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:48.826
You should be. 
It was stupid.

869
01:11:48.927 --> 01:11:51.896
But look, you gotta
make this right with my sister.


870
01:11:52.531 --> 01:11:55.500
Yeah. I messed that up.

871
01:11:55.651 --> 01:12:00.088
You did. But it's fixable.
Let's go fix it.


872
01:12:00.623 --> 01:12:02.106
All right.

873
01:12:06.512 --> 01:12:08.913
Yoo-hoo. You have a visitor.

874
01:12:09.748 --> 01:12:11.198
Hey, get over here.

875
01:12:12.668 --> 01:12:14.619
Ah... This is cute.

876
01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:17.622
- You two play nice.
- You're a brat.


877
01:12:18.156 --> 01:12:19.440
Weirdo.

878
01:12:21.059 --> 01:12:23.562
Hey.

879
01:12:26.399 --> 01:12:28.416
Look, Amber, I...

880
01:12:28.518 --> 01:12:31.053
...I just wanted to apologize

881
01:12:31.154 --> 01:12:33.655
for how things went
at the party.


882
01:12:35.892 --> 01:12:39.845
It was stupid. I was stupid.

883
01:12:39.946 --> 01:12:44.083
I just misread the whole situation
and I acted like an ass.


884
01:12:44.184 --> 01:12:47.870
Yeah, you did.
And you embarrassed yourself.


885
01:12:47.971 --> 01:12:49.688
<i>" All we are we are "</i>

886
01:12:49.789 --> 01:12:50.822
Yeah.

887
01:12:50.923 --> 01:12:55.260
<i>" All we are we are "</i>

888
01:12:55.361 --> 01:12:59.548
<i>" Every day is a start. "</i>

889
01:12:59.649 --> 01:13:02.184
You know,
you're lucky you're cute.


890
01:13:04.304 --> 01:13:05.855
I've heard that a few times.

891
01:13:05.956 --> 01:13:09.008
Cocky.

892
01:13:09.109 --> 01:13:14.113
So, uh... is that a
second chance then?


893
01:13:14.214 --> 01:13:17.266
I believe you're
on your third chance.


894
01:13:18.101 --> 01:13:21.287
Three strikes, you're out.

895
01:13:21.388 --> 01:13:23.907
- Got it?
- Yeah.


896
01:13:36.103 --> 01:13:37.903
Mind a little company?

897
01:13:38.738 --> 01:13:40.773
Think it's gonna rain?

898
01:13:41.675 --> 01:13:43.609
- Hard to say.
- True.


899
01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:47.180
I want that painting back. You've
gotta give it back to me, Joshua.


900
01:13:47.281 --> 01:13:49.515
Well, you know, I haven't
really made up my mind yet.


901
01:13:49.616 --> 01:13:51.550
You're playing with fire, kid.

902
01:13:51.651 --> 01:13:54.387
You know, Everly,
I like watching you squirm.


903
01:13:54.488 --> 01:13:56.890
You know, all I've done
is offer you a chance.


904
01:13:56.992 --> 01:14:00.927
I'm giving you a golden pass to a life
where you can look after yourself.


905
01:14:01.029 --> 01:14:02.363
Oh, really, like you?

906
01:14:02.464 --> 01:14:04.198
You're mad at me
because you think I used you.


907
01:14:04.299 --> 01:14:07.234
Well, it's true, I did. So what?
That's life. Nothing comes free.


908
01:14:07.335 --> 01:14:10.004
Although, Anne-Marie wouldn't
want you to think that.


909
01:14:10.105 --> 01:14:12.139
Whatever,
you're nothing like her.


910
01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:15.009
- Really?
- Yeah, really. She has integrity.


911
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:18.345
That woman's got you twisted up in the head.
She has no integrity.


912
01:14:18.446 --> 01:14:21.415
You wanna know about Anne-Marie?
I'll tell you.


913
01:14:21.516 --> 01:14:22.949
Check out her studio.

914
01:14:23.051 --> 01:14:25.785
Dig around. Dig deep.

915
01:14:25.887 --> 01:14:28.088
You might find
something familiar.


916
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:29.623
See you around, kid.

917
01:15:49.873 --> 01:15:51.457
Oh, good afternoon.

918
01:15:51.558 --> 01:15:53.058
Is it?

919
01:15:53.159 --> 01:15:57.479
What would you think
of calling Vanessa Reese today,


920
01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:01.167
and just having a little chat with
her, you know, talk things over?


921
01:16:01.268 --> 01:16:05.471
You know what I think?
This is what I think.


922
01:16:05.572 --> 01:16:06.806
Joshua...

923
01:16:06.907 --> 01:16:08.107
You're a liar.

924
01:16:09.676 --> 01:16:11.777
I am not.

925
01:16:11.878 --> 01:16:14.897
Why don't you listen to me? Why don't
you listen to what I have to say?


926
01:16:14.998 --> 01:16:17.551
No. You're just like
the rest of them.


927
01:16:29.930 --> 01:16:31.732
Oh...

928
01:16:31.932 --> 01:16:34.184
I did the research you wanted
on that woman, Anne-Marie Cole.


929
01:16:34.285 --> 01:16:37.420
- Oh, good, what'd you find?
- You wouldn't believe it.


930
01:16:37.522 --> 01:16:40.890
Apparently, Anne-Marie was
investigated by the police.


931
01:16:40.991 --> 01:16:42.960
Investigated, huh?

932
01:16:45.696 --> 01:16:47.480
Detectives questioned her
three different times


933
01:16:47.582 --> 01:16:49.799
about her involvement
in an art forgery scandal.


934
01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:51.618
You're kidding.
Was she arrested?


935
01:16:51.719 --> 01:16:53.570
No, but there were rumors

936
01:16:53.671 --> 01:16:55.305
that she painted the forgeries,

937
01:16:55.406 --> 01:16:57.174
because right after
the investigation was closed,


938
01:16:57.275 --> 01:16:59.509
she came up with
a huge chunk of money.


939
01:16:59.610 --> 01:17:03.497
Apparently, the money was used to
cover a surgery cost for her kid.


940
01:17:03.598 --> 01:17:06.167
- When did this happen?
- It was about 40 years ago.


941
01:17:06.268 --> 01:17:09.820
Her husband and kids burned
in an accidental house fire.


942
01:17:09.921 --> 01:17:13.608
Only one survived. She did what she had
to do, but even with the surgeries,


943
01:17:13.709 --> 01:17:15.443
her daughter passed away
a few weeks later.


944
01:17:15.677 --> 01:17:17.178
Let's see...

945
01:17:18.614 --> 01:17:21.683
Wow. Hm...

946
01:18:48.722 --> 01:18:51.291
Joshua, hi!

947
01:18:52.426 --> 01:18:54.427
Hi, thanks for meeting.

948
01:18:56.147 --> 01:18:58.548
It's gorgeous here, huh?

949
01:19:02.587 --> 01:19:04.320
How you doing?

950
01:19:06.774 --> 01:19:09.008
Everything okay at Everly's?

951
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:11.961
It's fine.

952
01:19:12.146 --> 01:19:16.233
You know, I know you and
Anne-Marie have become friends and


953
01:19:16.334 --> 01:19:18.968
I know she's a little eccentric,
but I brought something


954
01:19:19.069 --> 01:19:22.572
that might help you understand
why she is the way she is.


955
01:19:22.673 --> 01:19:25.342
I don't care. She's nuts.

956
01:19:25.443 --> 01:19:28.796
Really. Just read this,
it'll only take a sec.


957
01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:31.398
Look, I know why
you're really here.


958
01:19:38.373 --> 01:19:39.807
So...

959
01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.577
...did you ever find my mom?

960
01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:51.251
You know, sometimes it takes a while
to put pieces together and...


961
01:19:51.352 --> 01:19:53.020
I asked you a question.

962
01:19:53.221 --> 01:19:55.456
Did you find my mom?

963
01:19:58.409 --> 01:20:01.812
No, I didn't find your mom.

964
01:21:11.785 --> 01:21:13.686
The presentation is starting.

965
01:21:13.787 --> 01:21:16.022
If that painting doesn't arrive
in three minutes, I'm finished.


966
01:21:16.123 --> 01:21:17.623
I looked for Joshua.

967
01:21:17.724 --> 01:21:19.692
I drove all over town
all day looking for him.


968
01:21:19.793 --> 01:21:21.360
- He's disa...
- Oh...


969
01:21:24.197 --> 01:21:25.998
I thought you might like this.

970
01:21:26.099 --> 01:21:29.268
Yeah, it's good, it's good.
Get it out there, quick.


971
01:21:31.138 --> 01:21:32.872
Where the hell
were you hiding it?


972
01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:35.041
It's been safe the whole time.

973
01:21:35.142 --> 01:21:38.144
Joshua, I could...

974
01:21:40.180 --> 01:21:43.616
You did good. Here.

975
01:21:43.718 --> 01:21:45.986
In the morning, we're flying
private to New York.


976
01:21:46.087 --> 01:21:47.821
I got another piece
I want you to start working on,


977
01:21:47.922 --> 01:21:50.223
a $20 million Gustav Klimt.

978
01:21:50.324 --> 01:21:52.092
Finally, I'll get you
out of Carmel.


979
01:21:52.193 --> 01:21:53.960
- Gonna make you rich.
-  Ladies and gentlemen,


980
01:21:54.062 --> 01:21:56.697
please join the Sunset Center in
welcoming Mr. Everly Campbell.


981
01:22:06.491 --> 01:22:09.008
Thank you. Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.


982
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:14.348
Thank you for joining me on this very
special occasion of my 60th birthday.


983
01:22:14.449 --> 01:22:17.617
I want to open by saying that you
all know me as a businessman,


984
01:22:17.718 --> 01:22:22.222
but I've always thought of myself,
first and foremost, as an artist.


985
01:22:22.323 --> 01:22:26.343
And as any artist who wants
to be the best they can be,


986
01:22:26.444 --> 01:22:29.546
it's always been important to me
to honor and acknowledge


987
01:22:29.647 --> 01:22:31.181
those who came before.

988
01:22:31.282 --> 01:22:33.985
And it's in this spirit
that I have scoured the earth


989
01:22:34.085 --> 01:22:39.456
to find a painting by one of the greatest
of all American artists, Winslow Homer.


990
01:22:39.558 --> 01:22:43.511
And tonight, we can
unveil the rarest Winslow Homer

991
01:22:43.612 --> 01:22:46.314
the world has yet to see.

992
01:22:46.415 --> 01:22:48.850
This is a work
I acquired recently,


993
01:22:48.984 --> 01:22:53.204
a painting that was thought to have been
lost or destroyed during World War I.


994
01:22:53.339 --> 01:22:58.659
But it was found, perfectly intact,
and with a verifiable provenance.


995
01:22:58.761 --> 01:23:03.731
But, in order to prove
its authenticity beyond a doubt,


996
01:23:03.832 --> 01:23:08.535
Mr. Jeffrey Pinkus, one of the world's
foremost scientific art analysts,


997
01:23:08.637 --> 01:23:11.806
will begin to verify
the painting tonight,


998
01:23:11.907 --> 01:23:14.708
using an infrared analysis.

999
01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.761
Mr. Pinkus?

1000
01:23:17.230 --> 01:23:18.530
Bernie.

1001
01:23:36.232 --> 01:23:39.552
The camera is now
scanning the painting


1002
01:23:39.653 --> 01:23:43.539
and will construct an image of
what lies beneath the surface,


1003
01:23:43.640 --> 01:23:47.927
thereby revealing any irregularities
or underlying images.


1004
01:23:48.028 --> 01:23:49.879
It's an almost
instantaneous process


1005
01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:54.266
and will reveal the
true nature of the artwork.


1006
01:23:56.219 --> 01:23:58.386
Wait, stop! You can't do this!

1007
01:23:58.487 --> 01:24:01.073
It's a masterpiece! Security!

1008
01:24:01.173 --> 01:24:03.075
- You know it's all over.
- What are you doing?


1009
01:24:03.176 --> 01:24:08.598
Getting into it with you.
I swear, Everly Campbell,


1010
01:24:08.699 --> 01:24:11.368
you shut up and let me speak.

1011
01:24:13.937 --> 01:24:18.908
Ladies and gentlemen, all of you deserve
an explanation of what you've just seen.


1012
01:24:19.009 --> 01:24:21.611
It's about this painting...

1013
01:24:21.712 --> 01:24:24.297
...and this man...

1014
01:24:24.432 --> 01:24:30.536
...and demonstrates what can happen
and often does in the art world.


1015
01:24:31.438 --> 01:24:33.840
Ladies and gentlemen...

1016
01:24:33.941 --> 01:24:37.576
...this painting is a forgery.

1017
01:24:37.645 --> 01:24:40.296
She's a liar!

1018
01:24:40.398 --> 01:24:42.132
- What is going on here?
-  That's a lie!


1019
01:24:42.233 --> 01:24:43.917
A long time ago,

1020
01:24:44.018 --> 01:24:48.421
I created one of
Everly's masterpieces,


1021
01:24:48.572 --> 01:24:51.058
and it's haunted me ever since.

1022
01:24:51.159 --> 01:24:53.761
No, this is all
incredibly stupid...


1023
01:24:53.862 --> 01:24:55.663
Wait a minute!
There's something wrong.


1024
01:24:59.901 --> 01:25:01.619
There's an image
that shouldn't be here.


1025
01:25:01.803 --> 01:25:04.672
- What do you mean?
- There's an under-painting.


1026
01:25:04.773 --> 01:25:07.624
There shouldn't be any
under-painting on a Winslow Homer.


1027
01:25:07.725 --> 01:25:09.810
This is evidently a forgery.

1028
01:25:50.603 --> 01:25:55.056
Well! What are you doing here?
I thought you were mad at me.


1029
01:25:56.158 --> 01:25:57.992
I, uh...

1030
01:25:58.094 --> 01:26:00.195
I decided that...

1031
01:26:00.296 --> 01:26:03.164
...I'd like to stay with you.

1032
01:26:03.265 --> 01:26:05.183
You've come to the right place.

1033
01:26:05.935 --> 01:26:07.786
Come right in.

1034
01:26:07.803 --> 01:26:09.854
<i>I should've known what
I was looking for that night.</i>


1035
01:26:09.955 --> 01:26:12.073
<i>I crawled in
Anne-Marie's window.</i>


1036
01:26:12.174 --> 01:26:14.892
<i>I was looking
for a place to belong.</i>


1037
01:26:21.767 --> 01:26:26.421
<i>She knew that the moment she met me.
It just took me a while to believe it.</i>


1038
01:26:30.544 --> 01:26:33.346
<i>You could say I grew up in
Carmel, even though I didn't.</i>


1039
01:26:33.447 --> 01:26:35.248
<i>Not the way a normal kid does.</i>

1040
01:26:35.349 --> 01:26:38.567
<i>But it's where I got my
education, that's for sure.</i>


1041
01:26:53.016 --> 01:26:56.869
<i>I learned to use my talent...
the right way.</i>


1042
01:27:02.392 --> 01:27:04.910
<i>I learned how to say
"I'm sorry" and "thank you"</i>


1043
01:27:05.011 --> 01:27:08.814
<i>and how to keep
my fists to myself.</i>


1044
01:27:08.915 --> 01:27:12.085
<i>- But the best lesson I learned...
- Help me up.</i>


1045
01:27:12.186 --> 01:27:14.588
<i>First you kiss the hand...</i>

1046
01:27:14.705 --> 01:27:16.639
<i>...and then you kiss the girl.</i>

1047
01:30:12.836 --> 01:30:15.638
<i>We were sleeping in
for years</i>


1048
01:30:15.739 --> 01:30:20.644
<i>Letting go of our friends</i>

1049
01:30:20.745 --> 01:30:23.280
<i>Scaring our friends</i>

1050
01:30:23.381 --> 01:30:28.919
<i>We were seeing clearer
closing our eyes</i>


1051
01:30:29.020 --> 01:30:33.957
<i>And our lashes intertwined</i>

1052
01:30:34.058 --> 01:30:36.493
<i>The things you find</i>

1053
01:30:36.595 --> 01:30:41.732
<i>In the backseat
of your mind</i>


1054
01:30:41.833 --> 01:30:44.435
<i>What you find</i>

1055
01:30:44.536 --> 01:30:49.707
<i>And we filled each other's
footprints in the snow</i>


1056
01:30:49.807 --> 01:30:54.645
<i>Full of warm red alcohol</i>

1057
01:30:54.746 --> 01:30:59.916
<i>We were learning to make
the world stand still</i>


1058
01:31:00.017 --> 01:31:05.490
<i>And it will, but until</i>

1059
01:31:05.591 --> 01:31:10.428
<i>Do I lie in the backseat</i>

1060
01:31:10.529 --> 01:31:13.131
<i>Of your mind?</i>

1061
01:31:13.232 --> 01:31:15.533
<i>Do I lie?</i>

1062
01:31:15.635 --> 01:31:20.739
<i>Just a second
and we're gone</i>


1063
01:31:20.839 --> 01:31:25.877
<i>Just an imprint
when we're done</i>


1064
01:31:25.978 --> 01:31:31.082
<i>Just a second
and we're gone</i>


1065
01:31:31.183 --> 01:31:36.154
<i>Just an imprint
when we're done</i>


1066
01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:46.063
<i>It should be forever</i>

1067
01:31:46.165 --> 01:31:49.467
<i>God told me</i>

1068
01:31:51.204 --> 01:31:56.609
<i>We're born into
the wrong time</i>


1069
01:31:56.710 --> 01:32:01.914
<i>It should be forever</i>

1070
01:32:02.015 --> 01:32:05.351
<i>God told me</i>

1071
01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:12.625
<i>We're born into
