[Man Narrating]
As I've gotten older, I realize
I'm certain of only two things.


7
00:02:08.772 --> 00:02:14.369
Days that begin with rowing
on a lake are better
than days that do not.


8
00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:19.314
Second,
a man's character is his fate.


9
00:02:19.383 --> 00:02:23.217
And, as a student of history,
I find this hard to refute.


10
00:02:23.287 --> 00:02:27.451
For most of us,
our stories can be written
long before we die.


11
00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:32.154
There are exceptions
among the great men of history,

and I am not one of them.

I taught for 34 years.

One day I stopped teaching.

17

Those were the facts
of my life's chronicle.

00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:22.043
Hello.
Mr. Bell wanted to make sure
you were comfortable.

to tell you he's added an event...

why I had agreed to come.


38
00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:15.522
I'm not sure I knew.
It had something to do with hope.


39
00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:20.593
The young men that were
gathering here were among...


40
00:04:20.671 --> 00:04:24.471
the most successful and influential
of their generation.


41
00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:26.771
But I knew them
before any of that.


42
00:04:26.844 --> 00:04:29.278

[Man] Looking closer,
under the bishop's miter,


48
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.699
are the words, "Non sibi'...

or "Not for oneself."

00:05:30.074 --> 00:05:33.339
This embodies our philosophy
at Saint Benedict's.


51
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.710
The wisdom gained here
should be used for others...

And finally,
"Finis origine pendet. '"

"The end depends upon
the beginning. '"

could you define the word
"path" for me?


67
00:06:44.982 --> 00:06:48.145
Well, there are several
definitions, I suppose.


68
00:06:48.218 --> 00:06:51.483
Would "a route along which
someone or something moves"
be among them?

is a Saint Benedict's tradition.

It is a contest held each year
in two phases.


200

The first, is a series of quizzes...

at Saint Benedict's Hall...

Brutus is a pussy.
[Laughing]


302
00:20:25.134 --> 00:20:27.534
"A pussy"?

303
00:20:27.604 --> 00:20:30.164
Because he has
a conscience?


304
00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:32.868
Because he believes there's
a right way and a wrong way?
Oh, come on.


305
00:20:32.942 --> 00:20:35.376
Antony ended up
taking him down, right?


306
00:20:35.445 --> 00:20:37.470
Well, in a manner
of speaking, yes.


307
00:20:37.547 --> 00:20:39.538
He and Octavius, but...
But what?


308
00:20:39.616 --> 00:20:43.643
Had they killed him,
as the other guy suggested, uh...


309
00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:47.053
- Cassius.
- Yeah. Him.
If they'd done what he said,


310
00:20:47.123 --> 00:20:50.422
- Brutus might have
gone on to be king.
- Emperor, in fact.


311
00:20:50.493 --> 00:20:52.791
- Exactly.
- Which he had no desire to be.


312
00:20:52.862 --> 00:20:57.299
- Whatever. He would've won.
- Yes, but at what cost?
Remember Socrates?


313
00:20:57.367 --> 00:20:59.494
Not really.
[Chuckles]


314
00:20:59.569 --> 00:21:03.938
"It is not living
that is important,
but living rightly. '"


315
00:21:04.007 --> 00:21:07.602
Socrates chose to die
by unjust execution...


316
00:21:07.677 --> 00:21:11.078
rather than break the laws
of Athens to which he had
pledged obedience.


317
00:21:11.147 --> 00:21:14.947
Another genius.
[Bell Rings]


318
00:21:19.522 --> 00:21:22.218
[Chattering]

319
00:21:34.604 --> 00:21:36.970
[Shouting, Laughing]

320
00:21:40.076 --> 00:21:42.510
William, hold up.!

321
00:21:42.578 --> 00:21:44.569
Ellerby.
How are you, sir?


322
00:21:44.647 --> 00:21:46.615
Very well. How are things
in the Latin Quarter?


323
00:21:46.683 --> 00:21:48.947
Could not be happier.

324
00:21:49.018 --> 00:21:51.179
For making me feel
so much at home.


325
00:21:51.254 --> 00:21:54.519
I'm sure you have it,
but you might like it
'cause it's a first edition.


326
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.424
I found it in a rare bookshop
next to a copy of the Oresteia.
Oh, really?


327
00:22:00.263 --> 00:22:02.663
So young when he wrote this.

328
00:22:02.732 --> 00:22:05.633
I happen to have
attended a guest lecture
he gave at Dartmouth.


329
00:22:05.702 --> 00:22:07.636
Really?
Yeah.


330
00:22:07.704 --> 00:22:10.434
It must have been
something to grow up
around all that talent.


331
00:22:10.506 --> 00:22:12.633
Oh, it was. Indeed.

332
00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:17.246
Yes... Yes, he was...
[Bell Tolling]


333
00:22:18.614 --> 00:22:20.548
Thank you.
Sure.


334
00:22:20.616 --> 00:22:24.712
Very kind of you.
Farewell.
I'll see you later.


335
00:22:29.425 --> 00:22:33.327
- Okay. Fio.
- [Both] I am made. I become.


336
00:22:33.396 --> 00:22:35.330
Fis.
[Door Opening]


337
00:22:35.398 --> 00:22:37.389
Hey, guys.

338
00:22:38.601 --> 00:22:42.731
Fis.
[Both]
You are made. You become.


339
00:22:42.805 --> 00:22:45.569
[Martin]
Oh, okay, um...


340
00:22:45.641 --> 00:22:48.269
Fit?
[Deepak, Louis]
He, she, it is made.


341
00:22:48.344 --> 00:22:51.939
He, she, it becomes.
It is done.


342
00:22:52.014 --> 00:22:55.415
[Martin]
Okay, now for bonus points,
the plural of fit.


343
00:22:55.485 --> 00:22:57.419
F-Fiunt.
Yeah.


344
00:22:57.487 --> 00:22:59.751
[Martin]
Oh, okay. Um...


345
00:22:59.822 --> 00:23:03.019
Check it out.
It's from France.


346
00:23:03.092 --> 00:23:06.391
Thanks.
Um. Studio.


347
00:23:06.462 --> 00:23:08.396
I study.

348
00:23:08.464 --> 00:23:10.398
Um...
Oh, my God.


349
00:23:10.466 --> 00:23:12.559
[Martin] Come on. I think
we should be studying.
Oh, my God.


350
00:23:12.635 --> 00:23:16.401
- What?
- This shows hair.


351
00:23:17.774 --> 00:23:20.106
What do you mean by "hair"?

352
00:23:23.513 --> 00:23:25.606
Oh, my God.

353
00:23:27.784 --> 00:23:30.014

[Chuckles]

355
00:23:38.461 --> 00:23:41.294
Excuse me.

356
00:23:48.638 --> 00:23:52.802
Uh, can I point out that
if we get caught around
any of this we're dead?


357
00:23:52.875 --> 00:23:56.402
- I mean, seriously, we're dead.
- It'll be all right.


358
00:23:57.647 --> 00:24:00.241
[Scoffs]
I'm going to my room
to study.


359
00:24:00.316 --> 00:24:04.650
- Here, Marty. Study this.

[Boys Chuckling]

363
00:24:13.729 --> 00:24:16.425
[Martin]
Why are we doing this?
My allergies are killing me,


364
00:24:16.499 --> 00:24:19.297
rocks in my shoes,
poison ivy all over the place.


365
00:24:19.368 --> 00:24:22.701
I mean, the boathouse
is off-limits, and we can't
leave school property.


366
00:24:22.772 --> 00:24:25.400
What if this boat
has frickin' holes in it, huh?


367
00:24:25.475 --> 00:24:27.568
[Louis]
Get over it, Martin.
Oh, God!


368
00:24:27.643 --> 00:24:29.975
You guys just
don't understand
the consequences.


369
00:24:30.046 --> 00:24:32.879
They catch us and we get
kicked out and we don't get
our tuition back.


370
00:24:32.949 --> 00:24:36.385
[Deepak]
Martin, mellow out, man!
I can't just mellow out!


371
00:24:36.452 --> 00:24:39.683
I cannot get kicked out of here!
I'm a "legacy" for Christ's sake!


372
00:24:39.755 --> 00:24:41.689
My father was
Mr. Julius Caesar.


373
00:24:41.757 --> 00:24:45.557
Did he ever tell you
what question he won on?
Did he ever not tell me?


374
00:24:45.628 --> 00:24:48.188
"Which tribes invaded Rome
in 102 B.C.?"


375
00:24:48.264 --> 00:24:50.630
Teutons and the Cimbri.

376
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.225
The last words out of his mouth
before he dropped me off here.


377
00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.265
So, uh, Martin,

378
00:24:59.342 --> 00:25:02.004
Dare you really, like,
Nervous about...
Ohh!


379

[Laughing]
Incoming.
[Whizzing]


380
00:25:05.181 --> 00:25:07.149
[Firecracker Explodes]
Watch out, Marty.


381
00:25:08.885 --> 00:25:12.184
My informants tell me
if we head for that place...
Right, Saint Mary's?


382
00:25:12.255 --> 00:25:14.189
- Yeah.!
- No, no, no, no, no.


383
00:25:14.257 --> 00:25:16.691
The penalty for setting
foot on Saint Mary's property...
[Yells]


384
00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:20.525
What do you say, Deepak?
You want to go?
Yeah. I'll go.


385
00:25:20.596 --> 00:25:22.564
Louis?
Yeah. I'll go.


386
00:25:22.632 --> 00:25:25.658
See, Martin?
That's the problem
with democracy.


387
00:25:25.735 --> 00:25:29.762
[Martin]
Guys, I'm really nervous.
[Louis] Yeah. We know.


388
00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:32.364
I love uniforms.
L-I really think
we should turn around.


389
00:25:32.441 --> 00:25:35.205
[Deepak] Shut up, man.
[Girls' Voices, Indistinct]


390
00:25:36.913 --> 00:25:39.404
[Giggling]
[Martin] Seriously, we got
to turn around right now.


391
00:25:39.482 --> 00:25:41.746
This is not safe.!
[Louis]
Marty, shut up. Shut up.


392
00:25:41.817 --> 00:25:45.218
[Sedgewick]
Hey, come on. Easy does it, boys.


393
00:25:45.288 --> 00:25:47.552
Hi.
[Laughs]


394
00:25:47.623 --> 00:25:50.854
- You ladies go to school here?
- Duh.


395
00:25:50.927 --> 00:25:54.363
[All Giggling]

396
00:25:56.132 --> 00:25:59.101
We go across the lake.
We're on the crew team.


397
00:25:59.168 --> 00:26:01.932
He's our "coxman," so...
[Girl]
Coxswain.


398
00:26:02.004 --> 00:26:05.565
Right. No.
Right, I know.
Coxswain.


399
00:26:05.641 --> 00:26:08.371
So is it true what they say
about the guys who go...


400
00:26:08.444 --> 00:26:11.436
to "Saint Benedick's"?
[Laughing]


401
00:26:12.848 --> 00:26:16.614
I don't know.
Uh, what is that exactly?


402
00:26:17.687 --> 00:26:20.815
Tsk. So, uh,
what's your name?


403
00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:23.290
Um, I'm Sedgewick.
This is Deepak.


404
00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:24.724
Louis and Martin.
Hi.


405
00:26:24.794 --> 00:26:27.422
Marty, if you like.
Or Mar-Martin's fine.


406
00:26:27.496 --> 00:26:29.930
Why don't you give us
your phone number, and maybe
we'll call you sometime.


407
00:26:29.999 --> 00:26:32.900
- [Gasps] You are such...
- [Sedgewick]
Guys, what's our phone number?


408
00:26:32.969 --> 00:26:35.904
- [Deepak] 555-0169
- Um, area code 215.


409
00:26:37.707 --> 00:26:40.676
Okay.
So, um...


410
00:26:40.743 --> 00:26:43.075
Do you guys want to go
skinny-dipping?


411
00:26:43.145 --> 00:26:45.978
- Pardon me?
- You mean naked?


412
00:26:46.048 --> 00:26:48.107
[Girls Giggling]

413
00:26:49.652 --> 00:26:52.143
What?
What's he doin'?
[Girls Laughing]


414
00:26:52.221 --> 00:26:54.655
Oh, my God.

415
00:26:54.724 --> 00:26:58.353
So, uh, who's gonna
come with me then?


416
00:26:58.427 --> 00:27:01.988
[Girl]
Is he kidding?
[Girl #2] Oh, God.!


417
00:27:02.064 --> 00:27:04.692
Oh, no way.!
Not me. I don't want
to get my arm wet.


418
00:27:04.767 --> 00:27:06.758
Might lose your phone number.

419
00:27:06.836 --> 00:27:11.034
That's okay. I'll just
whisper it in your ear
so you won't forget.


420
00:27:11.107 --> 00:27:14.201
- I'll go!
- My God!


421
00:27:14.276 --> 00:27:16.540
I'll go too!
[Louis]
Disrobe men.!


422
00:27:16.612 --> 00:27:19.274
[Blubbering]
Yeah!


423
00:27:19.348 --> 00:27:20.781
[Girls Giggling]

424
00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:23.216
I'm going!

425
00:27:23.285 --> 00:27:26.618
Ladies.!
What is going on here?


426
00:27:26.689 --> 00:27:28.680
[Deepak]
Holy shit.!
[Louis] A nun.


427
00:27:28.758 --> 00:27:30.783
Oh, my God.

428
00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.021
There goes
your tuition, Marty.


429
00:27:33.095 --> 00:27:35.461
[Bell Tolling]
Come on!


430
00:27:35.531 --> 00:27:39.467
There is a code
at Saint Benedict's...


431
00:27:39.535 --> 00:27:42.299
of self-governance
based on mutual trust.


432
00:27:42.371 --> 00:27:46.364
[Tolling Continues]
You have violated that trust.


433
00:27:46.442 --> 00:27:50.310
And you've compromised
the reputation of this academy.


434
00:27:50.379 --> 00:27:54.008
If I thought you didn't know any
better, that would be one thing.


435
00:27:54.083 --> 00:27:58.179
But willful ignorance
is intolerable.


436
00:28:02.124 --> 00:28:05.491
You're confined to the dormitory
until 7:00 tomorrow morning.


437
00:28:05.561 --> 00:28:08.826
- What about dinner?
- [Both Laughing]


438
00:28:08.898 --> 00:28:12.425
- Excuse me?
- Well, I'm hungry, sir.


439
00:28:12.501 --> 00:28:15.061
- [Laughs]
Oh, my God!
- Mr. Masoudi?


440
00:28:17.773 --> 00:28:21.607
Mr. Hundert.
[Sputtering Laugh]
[Laughs]


441
00:28:25.614 --> 00:28:28.412
Have a good evening,
gentlemen.


442
00:28:36.892 --> 00:28:38.951
How you doing,
Mr. Hundert?


443
00:28:39.028 --> 00:28:40.962
Hi, Mr. H.

444
00:28:42.798 --> 00:28:45.858
Did you lock up the door?
I did.


445
00:28:45.935 --> 00:28:48.233
You did? Thanks.

to that question.

- Emperor?
- Yes!

Can you, please, name any
of the subsequent emperors...

00:30:16.792 --> 00:30:20.159
- There were 41.
- I only know seven.

can you in fact...

Oh.
Sedgewick, it seems,


538
00:36:00.602 --> 00:36:03.036
is not paying attention
in class, sir.


539
00:36:03.105 --> 00:36:06.006
Nor is he doing
the assigned reading.


540
00:36:06.074 --> 00:36:08.008
Let me ask you something.

541
00:36:08.076 --> 00:36:11.068
What's the good
of what you're teachin' those boys?


542
00:36:12.414 --> 00:36:14.974
- "The good"?
- Yes. The good.


543
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.814
Well, Senator,

544
00:36:19.188 --> 00:36:21.918
the Greeks and Romans provided...

545
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:24.424
a model of democracy, which,

546
00:36:24.493 --> 00:36:27.394
I don't need
to tell you, the framers
of our own Constitution...


547
00:36:27.462 --> 00:36:29.726
used as their inspiration.

548
00:36:29.798 --> 00:36:34.667
But more to the point,
I think when the boys
read Plato, Aristotle,


549
00:36:34.736 --> 00:36:37.261
Cicero, Julius Caesar even,

550
00:36:37.339 --> 00:36:39.637
they're put in direct contact
with men who,


551
00:36:39.708 --> 00:36:41.642
in their own age, exemplified...

552
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:44.508
the highest standards
of statesmanship,


553
00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.514

554
00:36:46.582 --> 00:36:48.573

Your job is to teach my son.

You teach him his times tables.

Teach him why the world is round.

Teach him who killed who
and when and where.

That is your job.

You, sir,
will not mold my son.

Do you know what...

00:38:16.204 --> 00:38:18.104
it's costing me to send
you to this place?

- What's wrong?
- Shut up.

My time is precious, son.
I thought I made that clear.


584
00:38:25.681 --> 00:38:28.115
I got better things to do
than to clean up after you.

You understand me?
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
I understand.

Don't forget it.

00:38:41.797 --> 00:38:44.459
So, what did she say, man.
What did she say?

Wrong girl.

Sedgewick and me a moment?
Yes, sir.


594

Thank you.
You're welcome, sir.


595
00:39:30.278 --> 00:39:33.304
I spoke to your father.
I know.

It was my textbook in high school.

has an outline...

of all the material which we'll
be covering this term.


602
00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.004
I thought it might
be helpful in preparing...

Sedgewick,
I'm lending you this book
because I believe in you.


607
00:40:19.294 --> 00:40:21.626
I think you could be
at the top of your class...

Well, you know what they say
about Rome.


617
00:41:51.887 --> 00:41:53.855
It wasn't
built in a day?


618
00:41:53.922 --> 00:41:55.856
No.
All roads lead to it.


619

You were right

is going to look at this book
between now and 7:00 a.m.


631
00:43:13.468 --> 00:43:15.493
I understand that, Mr. Bell.
I understand.


632
00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:20.064
Every boy in the third forum
has asked to check
this book out overnight.


633
00:43:20.141 --> 00:43:22.473
Now, if I let you have it,
that wouldn't be fair, would it?


634
00:43:22.544 --> 00:43:24.978
It would be fair.
I know in my heart
it would be.


635
00:43:25.046 --> 00:43:28.243
Mr. Bell,
you are exasperating.
Miss Peters,


636
00:43:28.316 --> 00:43:30.307
that is a great hairstyle.

637
00:43:30.385 --> 00:43:32.819
- Is that new?
- I've had it since 1958.


638
00:43:32.887 --> 00:43:36.254
Now, Mr. Bell, in order to be fair
to all the students,


639
00:43:36.324 --> 00:43:39.521
it is important that
this book always be available
here at this desk.


640
00:43:39.594 --> 00:43:41.585
It is
Saint Benedict's policy.


641
00:43:41.663 --> 00:43:44.257
And it will be
on your desk
tomorrow morning.


642
00:43:44.332 --> 00:43:46.266
I promise you.
You have my word.

No! No!

644
00:43:49.004 --> 00:43:51.837
Miss Peters, I can vouch
for this boy's character.


645
00:43:51.906 --> 00:43:53.897
He's one of my best students.

646

If he says it will be
on your desk first thing
in the morning,

it will be on your desk

a tremendous opportunity.


746
00:53:19.073 --> 00:53:22.065
Very good. Good.

747
00:53:30.585 --> 00:53:32.746
Well, you'll be missed.

748
00:53:33.955 --> 00:53:35.889
Both of you.

749
00:53:35.957 --> 00:53:39.358

And Sedgewick Bell.


765
00:55:03.911 --> 00:55:06.744
Of course, this competition,
this year's event,


766
00:55:06.814 --> 00:55:09.510
would not have been
possible if it hadn't been
for the passion...


767
00:55:09.583 --> 00:55:11.710
of our moderator.

768
00:55:11.786 --> 00:55:16.120
I give you
our learned Mr. Hundert.

Ladies.
Distinguished guests.


772
00:55:29.637 --> 00:55:32.572
Questions will be posed
to our three young scholars...


773
00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:34.574
in increasing levels
of difficulty.


774
00:55:34.642 --> 00:55:36.906
I ask you all to please
hold your applause...


775
00:55:36.977 --> 00:55:38.911
till the end
of each round.


776
00:55:38.979 --> 00:55:41.641
May the best man win.

777
00:55:45.219 --> 00:55:47.153
Mr. Masoudi,

778
00:55:47.221 --> 00:55:49.712
which emperor
sought to return...


779
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:51.724
all power to the Senate,

780
00:55:51.792 --> 00:55:54.226
only to garner
even greater power?


781
00:55:54.295 --> 00:55:56.490
Augustus, r-right?

782
00:55:56.564 --> 00:55:58.498
Correct.
Oh.


783
00:55:58.566 --> 00:56:00.500
Mr. Mehta,

784
00:56:00.568 --> 00:56:03.867
who introduced
the professional army to Rome?


785
00:56:03.938 --> 00:56:07.430
Gaius Marius, sir,
in 104 B.C.
Correct.


786
00:56:07.508 --> 00:56:09.908
Mr. Bell,

787
00:56:09.977 --> 00:56:12.172
on which Roman hill...

788
00:56:12.246 --> 00:56:15.113
was the infamous Tarpeian Rock?

789
00:56:22.356 --> 00:56:24.347
[Coughs]

790
00:56:31.665 --> 00:56:33.530
[Whispering]
It's Capitoline.


791
00:56:37.471 --> 00:56:40.634
Uh, Capitoline?

792
00:56:41.709 --> 00:56:43.973
Correct.

793
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:52.916
Mr. Masoudi, what is the full name
of the author of the Georgics?


794
00:56:52.987 --> 00:56:55.615
Publius Vergilius Maro.

795
00:56:55.689 --> 00:56:57.782
Military conquest
of 106 A.D. Involved
the bridging of the Danube?


796
00:56:57.858 --> 00:56:59.621
Trajan conquers Dacia.
Correct.


797
00:56:59.693 --> 00:57:02.253
What Roman Emperor might
the Greeks have characterized
"philosopher king"?


798
00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:05.765
- Marcus Aurelius.
- Correct.


799
00:57:08.869 --> 00:57:10.803
[Boy]
All right, Sedgewick.!


800
00:57:10.871 --> 00:57:14.500
Quiet.

801
00:57:14.575 --> 00:57:17.772
Quiet, please.

802
00:57:18.779 --> 00:57:20.713
Mr. Masoudi...

803
00:57:22.249 --> 00:57:24.581
Mr. Masoudi, who were
the first emperors...


804
00:57:24.652 --> 00:57:27.450
to rule over
the divided empire?


805
00:57:27.521 --> 00:57:31.252
Valentinian I
and Caecina.


806
00:57:31.325 --> 00:57:33.486
I'm sorry,
that is incorrect.


807

[Crowd Groans]

808
00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:38.089
Mr. Mehta?

809
00:57:38.165 --> 00:57:41.566
Valentinian I
and Valens.


810
00:57:41.635 --> 00:57:43.660
Correct.
Thank you, Mr. Masoudi.
[Applause]


811
00:57:43.737 --> 00:57:46.763
You may sit down.

812
00:57:46.841 --> 00:57:49.742
[Hundert] Well done.
[Boy]
Good job, man.


813
00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:59.342
Mr. Bell, which general...

814
00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:01.718
had the support
of the aristocrats...


815
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:05.384
in the civil war of 88 B.C.?

816
00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:32.680
[Whispering]
Sulla.


817
00:58:35.356 --> 00:58:37.517
Lucius Cornelius Sulla.

818
00:58:42.796 --> 00:58:45.560
That is correct.

819
00:58:45.633 --> 00:58:49.228
That's my boy!

820
00:58:52.706 --> 00:58:55.641
Mr. Woodbridge, I think
Sedgewick Bell is cheating.


821
00:58:57.077 --> 00:58:59.011
Let it go.
What?


822
00:58:59.079 --> 00:59:02.014
Ignore it.

823
00:59:02.082 --> 00:59:04.778
Ignore it?
Ignore it.


824
00:59:19.233 --> 00:59:24.170
Mr. Mehta, into how many
administrative regions
did Augustus divide Rome?


825
00:59:40.187 --> 00:59:42.985
Fourteen.

826
00:59:43.057 --> 00:59:45.355
Excuse me?
How many?


827
00:59:45.426 --> 00:59:47.417
- Fourteen.
- That is correct.


828
00:59:47.494 --> 00:59:50.930
[Boy]
All right, Deepak.! Whoo.!
[Applause]


829
01:00:05.312 --> 01:00:07.644
Mr. Bell,

830
01:00:09.183 --> 01:00:11.674
who was Hamilcar Barca?

831
01:00:24.365 --> 01:00:27.198
Would you repeat
the question, please?


832
01:00:27.267 --> 01:00:31.101
Who was Hamilcar Barca?

833
01:00:45.052 --> 01:00:47.850
I don't know.
[Crowd Groaning]


834
01:00:58.365 --> 01:01:00.731
Mr. Mehta,
who was Hamilcar Barca?


835
01:01:00.801 --> 01:01:05.795
The Carthaginian general
victorious in the battle
of Drepana in 249.


836
01:01:05.873 --> 01:01:10.003
An unequaled commander
with the misfortune
of being on the wrong side.


837
01:01:10.077 --> 01:01:12.875
That is correct.

838
01:01:12.946 --> 01:01:15.642
[Applause, Cheers]

839
01:01:29.797 --> 01:01:32.163
Thank you, Louis.
Thank you.


840
01:01:40.741 --> 01:01:42.675
Mr. Julius Caesar.

841
01:01:59.326 --> 01:02:02.227
Harrison, how's your sister?
You better not
speak to her.


842
01:02:02.296 --> 01:02:05.163
Mr. H., good job, man.
Good job, Mr. Hundert.


843
01:02:06.266 --> 01:02:08.393
[Boy]
Hey, Jeremy.! How you doin'?


844
01:02:11.004 --> 01:02:13.302
[Knocking]
[Door Opening]


845

[Door Closing]

846
01:02:23.484 --> 01:02:27.045
That was quite
an interesting performance
this afternoon.


847
01:02:27.121 --> 01:02:29.282
I knew you saw.

848
01:02:44.772 --> 01:02:48.640
Why, Sedgewick?

849
01:02:48.709 --> 01:02:50.768
You knew the material.

850
01:02:50.844 --> 01:02:53.677
Why not?

851
01:02:58.952 --> 01:03:02.115
How come you didn't stand up
and call me out?


852
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:06.250
It's a complicated matter,
Sedgewick.


853
01:03:08.629 --> 01:03:11.189
It wasn't because
of my father, was it?


854
01:03:14.001 --> 01:03:16.663
It had nothing to do
with your father.


855
01:03:20.541 --> 01:03:24.500
Sure, Mr. Hundert.
Sure.


856
01:03:48.468 --> 01:03:51.369
[Door Closing]

857
01:03:51.438 --> 01:03:54.168
William.!

858
01:03:54.241 --> 01:03:57.267
I came by
to congratulate you.
That was terrific.!


859
01:03:57.344 --> 01:04:00.575
Sedgewick Bell...
quite the surprise.
Yes.


860
01:04:00.647 --> 01:04:04.139
He's come a long way.
You must be very proud of him.


861
01:04:04.218 --> 01:04:06.186
It makes
for wonderful theater.


862
01:04:06.253 --> 01:04:09.814
In fact, I was thinking,
I might make the suggestion
to you, and to Mr. Woodbridge,


863
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:11.824
that in the future
more alumni are invited.


864
01:04:11.892 --> 01:04:16.022
Not just the parents
of the finalists,
but maybe all of the alumni.


865
01:04:16.096 --> 01:04:18.428
You know?
And instead of it happening
just on any old weekday,


866
01:04:18.498 --> 01:04:21.467
think about making it
a weekend event.


867
01:04:21.535 --> 01:04:24.663
You know, for fund-raising,
which would augur well
for your headmastership.


868
01:04:24.738 --> 01:04:29.038
Mmm.
What's wrong?


869
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:31.100
[Sighs]

870
01:04:33.714 --> 01:04:36.945
Sedgewick cheated.

871
01:04:37.017 --> 01:04:38.985
What?
Come in.


872
01:04:41.655 --> 01:04:44.852
Well, the pressure to succeed
can be oppressive.


873
01:04:44.925 --> 01:04:46.859
And, right or wrong,

874
01:04:46.927 --> 01:04:50.556
Woodbridge felt it was in the
best interests of the school's
endowment to let it pass.


875
01:04:50.631 --> 01:04:53.293
Come on. William, you didn't
put the boy up on the stage.


876
01:04:53.367 --> 01:04:55.301
He got there
on his own merit.


877
01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:57.360
All you did was inspire him...

878
01:04:57.437 --> 01:05:01.066
to study and to learn, and for that
you should be commended.


879
01:05:18.992 --> 01:05:21.961
And thus began
an uneasy truce...


880
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:24.896
between Sedgewick Bell
and myself.


881
01:05:24.965 --> 01:05:28.332
Whatever spark had ignited him
during the previous months...


882
01:05:28.402 --> 01:05:30.495
was now extinguished.

883
01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:32.970
And his brief flirtation
with diligence...


884
01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:35.975
was supplanted by
a renewed appetite for brashness,


885
01:05:36.043 --> 01:05:38.568
contempt and folly.

886
01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:44.915
As for his classmates,
his effect on them was almost hypnotic.


887
01:05:44.985 --> 01:05:46.919
Wherever he went,
they hovered,


888
01:05:46.987 --> 01:05:49.353
Sedgewick for class president.
Utterly blind to any
deficiencies in his character.


889
01:05:49.423 --> 01:05:51.414
Food fight!

890
01:05:51.491 --> 01:05:53.891
So, his remaining years at
Saint Benedict's passed...


891
01:05:53.961 --> 01:05:56.953
amidst an inexhaustible series
of pranks,


892
01:05:57.030 --> 01:05:59.464
and an avalanche
of C's and D's.


893
01:05:59.533 --> 01:06:02.161
Sedgewick Hyram Bell.

894
01:06:02.235 --> 01:06:05.102
And though his father's influence
guaranteed him a place at Yale,


895
01:06:07.007 --> 01:06:09.339
it was with a
profound sense of failure,


896
01:06:09.409 --> 01:06:12.845
that in the spring of 1976,

897
01:06:12.913 --> 01:06:17.577
I handed
Sedgewick Bell his diploma.


898
01:06:28.562 --> 01:06:30.860
[Bell Tolling]

899
01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:45.376
According to Heraclitus,

900
01:06:45.445 --> 01:06:48.073
we cannot step into
the same river twice.


901
01:06:48.148 --> 01:06:50.173
"In the flow of time, '"
he argued,


902
01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:53.413
"an opportunity lost
is lost forever. '"


903
01:06:56.823 --> 01:07:01.260
And yet, when Elizabeth's
marriage ended and she
returned home from England,


904
01:07:01.328 --> 01:07:03.694
the waters in which
we found ourselves swimming...


905
01:07:03.764 --> 01:07:09.600
were precisely as lovely
as those we had earlier only imagined.


906
01:07:09.669 --> 01:07:12.103
But if time had made
concessions for love,


907
01:07:12.172 --> 01:07:14.606
it made none for death.

908
01:07:14.674 --> 01:07:17.370
And when our headmaster,
Terence Woodbridge, passed away,


909
01:07:17.444 --> 01:07:19.969
I felt profound sadness.

910
01:07:20.047 --> 01:07:23.676
Though the incident
with Sedgewick Bell
had tested our friendship,


911
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:25.775
he had for half a century...

912
01:07:25.852 --> 01:07:30.846
devoted himself
to St. Benedict's tradition of
academic and moral leadership...


913
01:07:30.924 --> 01:07:33.893
A tradition, I realized,
that was now mine...


914
01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.019
to safeguard.

915
01:07:55.715 --> 01:07:57.649
Good luck, Mr. Hundert.

916
01:07:57.717 --> 01:08:00.242
Thank you, Mr. Horner.

917
01:08:01.521 --> 01:08:04.149
Everyone.
Welcome.


918
01:08:04.224 --> 01:08:06.488
Larry, good to see you.

919
01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:10.587
Hi.
Mr. Phillips.


920
01:08:10.664 --> 01:08:12.791
Mr. Hundert.
Good to see you again.


921
01:08:12.866 --> 01:08:14.834
Uh, please take a seat.

922
01:08:14.901 --> 01:08:17.131
Uh...
Let's get right to it,
shall we?


923
01:08:17.204 --> 01:08:21.038
As you wish.

924
01:08:21.108 --> 01:08:24.771
Mr. Hundert, your contributions
at Saint Benedict's
have been extraordinary.


925
01:08:24.845 --> 01:08:28.246
Your tenure is unmatched,
and you are loved and revered by all.


926
01:08:28.315 --> 01:08:31.307
The notion of taking you away
from your classroom...


927
01:08:31.384 --> 01:08:33.682
is one to which
we've given great thought.


928
01:08:33.753 --> 01:08:36.085
A headmaster's job
is a rigorous one.


929
01:08:36.156 --> 01:08:39.319
The travel demands
and meeting schedules
have become unending.


930
01:08:39.392 --> 01:08:43.158
One must be prepared
to do battle 24 hours a day
and sometimes longer.


931
01:08:43.230 --> 01:08:46.529
Well, having rowed our lake
every day, weather permitting,


932
01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.364
through the last seven
presidential administrations,


933
01:08:49.436 --> 01:08:51.927
I feel more than ready
to do battle.


934
01:08:56.042 --> 01:08:58.374
What we're saying,
Mr. Hundert, is...


935
01:09:00.847 --> 01:09:03.839
Mr. Hundert,
what experience do you have...


936
01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:07.512
with fund-raising
or building endowments?


937
01:09:07.587 --> 01:09:10.715
Mr. Hundert, we can't afford
to lose you as a teacher here.


938
01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:13.623
The reality is this.
Enrollment is down.


939
01:09:13.693 --> 01:09:16.628
People are thinking
of Saint Benedict's as old-fashioned.


940
01:09:16.696 --> 01:09:20.928
We need to look
more to the future
and less to the past.


941
01:09:26.072 --> 01:09:29.303
Then who?

942
01:09:30.577 --> 01:09:32.807
Someone from the outside?

943
01:09:32.879 --> 01:09:35.404
James Ellerby.

944
01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:39.384
Excuse me?

945
01:09:39.452 --> 01:09:42.250
You did realize he made
application for the job.


946
01:09:42.322 --> 01:09:44.790
Mr. Ellerby has proposed
some very exciting...
No.


947
01:09:44.858 --> 01:09:48.350
Fund-raising possibilities.

948
01:09:51.531 --> 01:09:54.728
Miss Johnston, I've been
assistant headmaster for 17 years.


949
01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:56.860
I fail to see how Mr. Ellerby's...

950
01:09:56.937 --> 01:09:58.871
qualifications as a fund-raiser...

951
01:09:58.939 --> 01:10:00.873
It's not just
about fund-raising.


952
01:10:00.941 --> 01:10:04.433
James Ellerby is
a forward-thinking man.


953
01:10:04.511 --> 01:10:06.445
He's reached out
to the community.


954
01:10:06.513 --> 01:10:09.914
He's built relationships to some
of the most important alumni.


955
01:10:09.983 --> 01:10:12.451
He is a wonderful communicator,

956
01:10:12.519 --> 01:10:14.453
with impeccable
moral standing...


957
01:10:14.521 --> 01:10:17.752
and an unwavering
commitment to this school.


958
01:10:18.925 --> 01:10:20.859
So...

959
01:10:23.163 --> 01:10:25.529
Then you leave me no choice
but to tender my resignation.


960
01:10:25.599 --> 01:10:29.262
I would ask you not to.

961
01:10:29.336 --> 01:10:32.032
You are a teacher, and
the finest one we've ever had.


962
01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.974
Please excuse me.

963
01:10:36.042 --> 01:10:40.240
Please understand, Mr. Hundert,
you will be welcome back here
at Saint Benedict's at any time.


964
01:10:40.313 --> 01:10:43.146
Th-The door
will forever be open.


965
01:11:37.237 --> 01:11:39.171
I'm still shocked
at James Ellerby.


966
01:11:39.239 --> 01:11:43.835
Oh, I'm not.
I'm only shocked
that I didn't see it coming.


967
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:47.937
I realize now he'd been
conducting a behind-the-scenes
campaign for years.


968
01:11:48.014 --> 01:11:53.179
He's godfather to two
of the board members' children,
for God's sake.


969
01:11:53.253 --> 01:11:55.346
[Sighs]

970
01:11:55.422 --> 01:11:57.890
I have...

971
01:11:57.957 --> 01:12:00.221
so many other things...

972
01:12:00.293 --> 01:12:02.659
that I've always
wanted to do.


973
01:12:02.729 --> 01:12:04.663
L-I've always
wanted to write.


974
01:12:04.731 --> 01:12:08.223
I have an idea
for a book on the early days
of the Republic.


975
01:12:08.301 --> 01:12:10.929
Well,

976
01:12:11.004 --> 01:12:13.302
here's to Saint Benedict's.

977
01:12:27.687 --> 01:12:29.917
I brought you some tea.

978
01:12:29.989 --> 01:12:31.923
Mmm.

979
01:12:31.991 --> 01:12:33.891
Going well?

980
01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.588
Oh, it's virtually
writing itself.


981
01:12:36.663 --> 01:12:39.723
Good.
Then I won't interrupt you.


982
01:12:39.799 --> 01:12:43.291
Carry on, then.
Good writing.


983
01:12:53.079 --> 01:12:55.013
[Sighs]

984
01:13:17.237 --> 01:13:20.138
William?

985
01:13:20.206 --> 01:13:22.936
James Ellerby's on the phone.

986
01:13:23.009 --> 01:13:27.946
The merger makes him C.E.O.
Of one of the largest
corporations in America.


987
01:13:28.014 --> 01:13:31.950
But what does any of this
have to do with me?


988
01:13:32.018 --> 01:13:34.248
Here's the thing.
He's informed us
that he would like to make...


989
01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.686
a substantial donation
to Saint Benedict's...


990
01:13:36.756 --> 01:13:38.690
with one condition.

991
01:13:38.758 --> 01:13:42.216
He would like to hold
a rematch of the
Mr. Julius Caesar contest.


992
01:13:42.295 --> 01:13:44.490
A rematch?

993
01:13:44.564 --> 01:13:46.794
With you
as master of ceremonies.


994
01:13:46.866 --> 01:13:49.232
Why?

995
01:13:49.302 --> 01:13:51.236
He says he would like to
reclaim his intellectual honor.


996
01:13:51.304 --> 01:13:55.172
And he says his secretary's
already located Louis Masoudi
and Deepak Mehta...


997
01:13:55.241 --> 01:13:58.108
and doesn't really
anticipate too much trouble
tracking down the others.


998
01:13:58.178 --> 01:14:00.669
Didn't you tell him
I had retired?


999
01:14:00.747 --> 01:14:03.580
Well, he asked
for you and only you.


1000
01:14:03.650 --> 01:14:06.141
He insisted on it
as a condition.


1001
01:14:06.219 --> 01:14:12.089
And did Mr. Bell say how much
of a donation he was planning
to make to Saint Benedict's?


1002
01:14:12.158 --> 01:14:15.855
Enough for a 25,000-square-foot
addition to the library...


1003
01:14:15.929 --> 01:14:17.863
in honor
of his father.


1004
01:14:17.931 --> 01:14:20.866
It would be the school's
single largest donation to date.


1005
01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:26.668
And a retired history professor
with no fund-raising ability
is the linchpin.


1006
01:14:26.873 --> 01:14:29.535
Yes.

1007
01:14:29.609 --> 01:14:32.009
It's ironic.

1008
01:14:32.078 --> 01:14:34.171
Life's a funny thing,
William, huh?


1009
01:14:34.247 --> 01:14:36.875
Where does he propose
to hold this rematch?


1010
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:40.716
[Ellerby] A resort
on the Gold Coast of Long Island
that his company owns.


1011
01:14:40.787 --> 01:14:42.721
The proposed itinerary
is all in here.


1012
01:15:03.076 --> 01:15:05.476
[Helicopter Whirring]

1013
01:15:35.542 --> 01:15:37.476
Ah, Mr. Hundert.

1014
01:15:37.544 --> 01:15:39.569
Mr. Bell.

1015
01:15:39.646 --> 01:15:41.876
And how was your trip?

1016
01:15:41.948 --> 01:15:43.882
It was unlike anything
I've ever experienced.


1017
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:47.181
I now know how Caesar Augustus
must have felt...


1018
01:15:47.253 --> 01:15:49.778
being carried head high
in the litter past the Tiber.
Oh, really?


1019
01:15:49.856 --> 01:15:52.723
It's all a bit overwhelming.

1020
01:15:52.792 --> 01:15:56.250
Well, don't let this fool you.
I am still the son of a pig farmer.


1021
01:15:56.329 --> 01:16:00.561
I really appreciate
you coming here
this weekend.


1022
01:16:00.633 --> 01:16:03.966
You know, you think things
that happen when you're 15
don't matter, but...


1023
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:18.281
[Chattering]

1024
01:16:24.023 --> 01:16:27.459
[Man]
Great party.
I'm so glad to see you.


1025
01:16:27.527 --> 01:16:30.291
[Bell] I mean, this guy...
you should have saw him
in boarding school.


1026
01:16:30.363 --> 01:16:32.627
I mean, oh...
Excuse me, guys,
I'll be right back.


1027
01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.934
Mr. Hundert. Please.

1028
01:16:36.002 --> 01:16:38.197
Sedgewick.
Please come and join us.


1029
01:16:38.271 --> 01:16:41.001
I'd like you to meet
my top two advisors.
This is John.


1030
01:16:41.074 --> 01:16:43.008
Hi, John.
Hi, Mr. Hundert.


1031
01:16:43.076 --> 01:16:45.067
- And Robert.
- How do you do, Mr. Hundert?


1032
01:16:45.144 --> 01:16:49.274
- Very well, thank you.
- And, my lovely wife, Victoria.


1033
01:16:49.349 --> 01:16:53.149
So nice to finally meet you, sir.
I've heard so much about you.


1034
01:16:53.219 --> 01:16:56.450
All right, all right!

1035
01:16:56.522 --> 01:16:58.490
[Bell]
This is the time of the evening...


1036
01:16:58.558 --> 01:17:01.254
where I'd like to
call upon a unique g...


1037
01:17:01.327 --> 01:17:04.421
Oh, Brewster.

1038
01:17:06.032 --> 01:17:08.159
I'd like to call upon
a unique gentleman,


1039
01:17:08.234 --> 01:17:12.500
one who managed to chisel
the rise and fall of
the Roman Empire into our minds,


1040
01:17:12.572 --> 01:17:15.598
whether we liked it or not.

1041
01:17:15.675 --> 01:17:18.542
- Our Mr. Hundert.
- [Man]
Hear.! Hear.!


1042
01:17:18.611 --> 01:17:20.806
[Applause]

1043
01:17:24.517 --> 01:17:28.044
I must say, um...
You've all grown up.


1044
01:17:28.121 --> 01:17:31.522
I feel as if
I should do roll call...


1045
01:17:31.591 --> 01:17:33.388
just to be sure
to whom I'm speaking.


1046
01:17:33.459 --> 01:17:37.054
Seriously,
to stand here among...


1047
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:39.360
my students...

1048
01:17:39.432 --> 01:17:41.491
[Laughing]

1049
01:17:45.605 --> 01:17:47.539
I expect to see
you all in detention.


1050
01:17:47.607 --> 01:17:49.541
[Together]
Oh, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!


1051
01:17:49.609 --> 01:17:52.305
Now, risen to become...

1052
01:17:52.378 --> 01:17:55.836
a bunch
of drunken reprobates...


1053
01:17:57.750 --> 01:18:01.083
who are now a veritable
who's who of American industry,


1054
01:18:01.154 --> 01:18:04.089
law, finance
and higher education.


1055
01:18:04.157 --> 01:18:08.526
Well, I can think
of few greater privileges.


1056
01:18:08.594 --> 01:18:10.528
I thank you.

1057
01:18:10.596 --> 01:18:13.258
[Laughs]

1058
01:18:14.667 --> 01:18:17.363
More coffee, sir?
Yes. Thank you.


1059
01:18:21.874 --> 01:18:25.275
Mr. Hundert?

1060
01:18:28.147 --> 01:18:33.050
Martin. Martin Blythe.

1061
01:18:33.119 --> 01:18:35.781
It's good
to see you again, sir.


1062
01:18:35.855 --> 01:18:39.052
When you weren't
at the dinner last night,
I was worried that perhaps...


1063
01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:41.252
That I wasn't
gonna make it?


1064
01:18:41.327 --> 01:18:43.795
Oh, come on, Mr. Hundert.
I wouldn't miss this.


1065
01:18:43.863 --> 01:18:45.797
You know, I was going
over my notes the other day...


1066
01:18:45.865 --> 01:18:48.231
in preparation
for the...
The competition.


1067
01:18:48.301 --> 01:18:51.202
Yes, and l-I came
across an essay...


1068
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:55.297
that you once wrote
on the Five Good Emperors.


1069
01:18:55.374 --> 01:18:57.399
It's amazing.
You were...


1070
01:18:57.477 --> 01:18:59.741
You were always
a wonderful student, Martin.


1071
01:18:59.812 --> 01:19:01.746
I, uh,

1072
01:19:01.814 --> 01:19:05.341
I never quite
gave you your due.


1073
01:19:05.418 --> 01:19:08.148
Now, why would
you say that?


1074
01:19:08.221 --> 01:19:11.748
Oh, I don't know, l...

1075
01:19:11.824 --> 01:19:14.918
My God, Mr. Hundert,
you...


1076
01:19:14.994 --> 01:19:19.055
That recommendation you wrote
when I applied for the Academy...


1077
01:19:19.132 --> 01:19:23.193
It was glowing. It was...

1078
01:19:23.269 --> 01:19:26.238
Of course
you gave me my due.


1079
01:19:26.305 --> 01:19:28.364
You gave me
more than my due.


1080
01:19:29.375 --> 01:19:31.309
[Shouting, Indistinct]

1081
01:19:31.377 --> 01:19:34.107
Grab his wrists! Push.

1082
01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:36.341
Okay, Deepak. With what emperor
did the Julio-Claudian dynasty
come to an end?


1083
01:19:36.415 --> 01:19:38.349
Mmm.
Masoudi?


1084
01:19:38.417 --> 01:19:40.783
Nero.

1085
01:19:40.853 --> 01:19:45.313
We did it! Yeah!
Good job, Robert.
All right, all right.


1086
01:19:45.391 --> 01:19:47.325
Time to study.

1087
01:19:47.393 --> 01:19:51.124
No. Come on, Dad.!
One more game?


1088
01:19:57.804 --> 01:19:59.863
[Knocking]

1089
01:19:59.939 --> 01:20:02.499
Come in.

1090
01:20:02.575 --> 01:20:05.305
- Sorry to bother you, sir.
- Oh, no bother.


1091
01:20:05.378 --> 01:20:07.312
How are you, Sedgewick?
I am fine.


1092
01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:10.508
I have something for you.

1093
01:20:10.583 --> 01:20:12.517
Oh, my God.

1094
01:20:12.585 --> 01:20:16.351
I hope there's
no late fee.


1095
01:20:16.422 --> 01:20:20.188
I understand now
why it meant so much to you.


1096
01:20:21.661 --> 01:20:25.757
"The Greeks carve cold marble
until it almost comes to life.


1097
01:20:25.832 --> 01:20:28.699
"The Greeks compose
great orations...


1098
01:20:28.768 --> 01:20:31.669
"and measure the heavens so well
they can predict the rising
of the stars.


1099
01:20:31.737 --> 01:20:34.797
"But you, Roman,
remember your great arts.


1100
01:20:34.874 --> 01:20:37.240
"To govern the people
with authority...


1101
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:39.835
"to establish peace
under the rule of law.


1102
01:20:39.912 --> 01:20:44.144
To conquer the mighty,
and to show them mercy
once they are conquered."


1103
01:20:50.423 --> 01:20:54.257
Well, it's nice to see
you haven't marked it up.
[Chuckles]


1104
01:20:55.628 --> 01:20:58.222
Yeah, I had my moments,
didn't I?


1105
01:20:58.297 --> 01:21:01.357
Your years, you mean.

1106
01:21:01.434 --> 01:21:04.961
Why did you
put up with me?


1107
01:21:06.973 --> 01:21:09.066
I suppose because...

1108
01:21:09.141 --> 01:21:13.908
I saw a young man who was
under a great deal of pressure.


1109
01:21:13.980 --> 01:21:16.710
And, not unlike your upbringing,

1110
01:21:16.782 --> 01:21:21.276
I too had a... a father
who was a very busy man.


1111
01:21:22.355 --> 01:21:25.847
[Chuckles]
You know, it's funny.


1112
01:21:25.925 --> 01:21:28.587
I remember traveling
with my father,


1113
01:21:28.661 --> 01:21:30.822
and there wasn't a person
he didn't know.


1114
01:21:30.897 --> 01:21:33.798
He talked, and he told stories,
and he was,


1115
01:21:33.866 --> 01:21:37.700
he was always full of advice,
always charming, and always...


1116
01:21:37.770 --> 01:21:39.704
the Senator.

1117
01:21:39.772 --> 01:21:43.606
But I can hardly remember
having a real conversation
with him.


1118
01:21:43.676 --> 01:21:46.577
In fact, I wonder if he ever
heard a word I'd spoken.


1119
01:21:49.115 --> 01:21:53.779
Years ago, I, uh,

1120
01:21:53.853 --> 01:21:56.981
visited him in the hospital
and he was very, very sick.


1121
01:21:57.056 --> 01:22:00.822
And it took a moment for him
to realize I was at his bedside.


1122
01:22:02.995 --> 01:22:06.431
And he began to cry.

1123
01:22:06.499 --> 01:22:08.729
And through his tears,
he looked up at me and he said,


1124
01:22:13.039 --> 01:22:15.735
"Talk to me."

1125
01:22:18.411 --> 01:22:21.437
[Chuckles]

1126
01:22:21.514 --> 01:22:24.574
I wondered where to begin.
I had no idea.


1127
01:22:25.818 --> 01:22:29.777
But at the very moment
I started to talk,


1128
01:22:30.957 --> 01:22:35.087
he closed his eyes
and he passed away...


1129
01:22:36.629 --> 01:22:41.293
without having heard a word.

1130
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:46.004
Ah, that son of a bitch.

1131
01:22:52.178 --> 01:22:54.772
Oh, God. Thanks.
Thanks again, Mr. Hundert,


1132
01:22:54.847 --> 01:22:58.112
for, uh, for making
all this possible.


1133
01:22:58.184 --> 01:23:00.118
It is my extreme pleasure.

1134
01:23:00.186 --> 01:23:02.347
I'm looking forward
to this evening. Best of luck.


1135
01:23:02.421 --> 01:23:05.618
Oh, much obliged.
I'll need all the help
I can get.


1136
01:23:05.691 --> 01:23:07.682
I don't think so.

1137
01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.490
See ya downstairs.
I'll see you downstairs.


1138
01:23:17.803 --> 01:23:19.896
[Applause]

1139
01:23:23.442 --> 01:23:25.433
[Man]
Go, Deepak!


1140
01:23:27.246 --> 01:23:29.373
[Man]
All right, Sedgewick!


1141
01:23:42.428 --> 01:23:45.556
It's not a good time.
I've gotta call you right back.
Thank you. Bye.


1142
01:23:45.631 --> 01:23:47.565
Sorry, sir.

1143
01:23:47.633 --> 01:23:50.397
Were you talking
to your broker?


1144
01:23:54.306 --> 01:23:56.365
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.


1145
01:23:56.442 --> 01:23:59.343
Our three scholars
will be posed questions...


1146
01:23:59.412 --> 01:24:02.347
on ancient history
in increasing levels of difficulty.


1147
01:24:02.415 --> 01:24:05.976
I ask you to please
hold your applause
until the end of each round.


1148
01:24:06.052 --> 01:24:08.213
May the best man win.

1149
01:24:13.292 --> 01:24:15.226
Mr. Masoudi, are you ready?

1150
01:24:15.294 --> 01:24:17.228
Mr. Hundert,
I am Julius Caesar.


1151
01:24:17.296 --> 01:24:20.424
[Laughing]

1152
01:24:21.867 --> 01:24:24.427
Mr. Caesar,

1153
01:24:24.503 --> 01:24:26.437
of the first eight emperors,

1154
01:24:26.505 --> 01:24:30.100
which name is omitted
from the following list?


1155
01:24:30.176 --> 01:24:32.110
Augustus, Tiberius,

1156
01:24:32.178 --> 01:24:35.944
Caligula, Nero, Vespasian,

1157
01:24:36.015 --> 01:24:39.280
Titus, Domitian.

1158
01:24:41.287 --> 01:24:43.312
Trajan.

1159
01:24:43.389 --> 01:24:46.381
I'm sorry.
That is incorrect.


1160
01:24:46.459 --> 01:24:48.825
Oh.
Was it Marcus Aurelius?


1161
01:24:48.894 --> 01:24:50.828
- No.
- Commodus?


1162
01:24:50.896 --> 01:24:52.989
- No.
- Oh. Septimus?


1163
01:24:53.065 --> 01:24:56.000
Nope.
Gaseous Flatulus?


1164
01:24:58.471 --> 01:25:00.405
I'm sorry.
None of the above.


1165
01:25:00.473 --> 01:25:03.465
[Clears Throat] The question
goes to Mr. Mehta. Would you
like me to repeat the question?


1166
01:25:03.542 --> 01:25:06.010
No, sir.
It's Claudius, sir.
That is correct.


1167
01:25:06.078 --> 01:25:08.012
- See, I knew that.
- It was a short reign,
but a happy one.


1168
01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.173
You may be seated, Mr. Masoudi.

1169
01:25:12.585 --> 01:25:15.554
Thank you.
Thank you for your kindness.


1170
01:25:15.621 --> 01:25:18.556
[Man]
That's all right, Lou.


1171
01:25:18.624 --> 01:25:20.558
Now you can
check your messages.


1172
01:25:20.626 --> 01:25:22.594
Uh, Mr. Bell,

1173
01:25:22.661 --> 01:25:27.291
please translate, if you will,
alea jacta est.


1174
01:25:27.366 --> 01:25:30.096
Tell me who uttered these words,
and on what occasion.


1175
01:25:30.169 --> 01:25:34.469
Alea jacta est.
"The die is cast."


1176
01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:37.976
Caesar spoke these words
as he crossed the Rubicon
in defiance of his government.


1177
01:25:38.043 --> 01:25:40.807
That is correct.

1178
01:25:43.249 --> 01:25:45.717
I've been studying.
I can see that.


1179
01:25:47.186 --> 01:25:49.120
Mr. Mehta,

1180
01:25:49.188 --> 01:25:52.851
what year was the Roman army
crushed at Lake Trasimene?


1181
01:25:52.925 --> 01:25:54.859
217 B.C., sir.

1182
01:25:54.927 --> 01:25:57.862
Correct.

1183
01:25:57.930 --> 01:26:00.490
Mr. Bell, who was
the last emperor...


1184
01:26:00.566 --> 01:26:02.557
of the Western Empire?

1185
01:26:12.845 --> 01:26:15.075
Romulus Augu...

1186
01:26:16.415 --> 01:26:20.249
[Clears Throat]
Romulus Augustulus.


1187
01:26:20.319 --> 01:26:22.514
Correct.

1188
01:26:29.895 --> 01:26:31.829
- Mr. Mehta.
- Milvian Bridge.


1189
01:26:31.897 --> 01:26:33.831
- Correct.
- Lex Vatinia.


1190
01:26:33.899 --> 01:26:35.764
- Very good.
- Praetorian Guard.


1191
01:26:35.834 --> 01:26:38.394
- [Bell]
Marcus Aurelius.
- Theodosius II.


1192
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:40.495
- That is correct.
- Comitia Tributa.


1193
01:26:40.573 --> 01:26:42.734
- The Hadrianic rotunda.
- Well done.


1194
01:26:49.415 --> 01:26:51.349
Mr. Bell,

1195
01:26:51.417 --> 01:26:55.444
which tribes
invaded Rome in 102 B.C.?


1196
01:26:58.123 --> 01:27:00.057
Um...

1197
01:27:00.125 --> 01:27:02.184
[Hundert]
Take your time.


1198
01:27:04.230 --> 01:27:06.164
The Teutons.

1199
01:27:06.232 --> 01:27:08.894
Oh, um... God.

1200
01:27:11.170 --> 01:27:14.037
Um...

1201
01:27:16.976 --> 01:27:18.910
[Sighs]

1202
01:27:37.630 --> 01:27:40.098
I'm gonna take a stab here.
Uh...

The Cimbri?

1204
01:27:48.407 --> 01:27:51.342
That is correct.

1205
01:27:57.916 --> 01:28:00.817
Well done. I'm impressed.

1206
01:28:02.721 --> 01:28:06.316
Thank you very much.
Good. I'm...

Mr. Mehta...

1208

What was Caracalla's
greatest constit...


1209
01:28:30.182 --> 01:28:33.481
greatest constitutional reform?

1210
01:28:33.552 --> 01:28:38.012
He granted citizenship
to all free male inhabitants
of the empire.


1211
01:28:38.090 --> 01:28:40.558
That is correct.

1212
01:28:46.899 --> 01:28:48.833
Mr. Bell,

1213
01:28:53.772 --> 01:28:55.706
who was Shutruk

Shutruk
-Nahhunte, huh?

1216
01:29:21.133 --> 01:29:23.567
Come on, Bell.
It was above the damn door.


1217
01:29:23.635 --> 01:29:27.332
The door.!
He's gotta know this.


1218
01:29:27.406 --> 01:29:29.499
The door, Sedgewick.!
Come on.!


1219
01:29:32.811 --> 01:29:34.540
Come on, Sedgewick.

1220
01:29:36.982 --> 01:29:38.916
The plaque!

1221
01:29:44.556 --> 01:29:47.184
I guess if Deepak
can nab this one,


1222
01:29:47.259 --> 01:29:50.353
then it's his ball game.

1223
01:29:57.870 --> 01:30:00.771
Mr. Mehta,
who was Shutruk-Nahhunte?


1224
01:30:00.839 --> 01:30:04.331
Shutruk-Nahhunte,
King of Ansham and Susa,


1225
01:30:04.410 --> 01:30:07.470
sovereign of the land of Elam.

1226
01:30:07.546 --> 01:30:11.312
That is correct.
[Cheering, Clapping]


1227
01:30:26.398 --> 01:30:29.492
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Julius Caesar!


1228
01:30:29.568 --> 01:30:31.798
- Hail, Caesar.!
- Hail, Caesar!


1229
01:30:33.839 --> 01:30:38.276
- Congratulations. Good job.
- [Man] Hail, Caesar.!


1230
01:30:38.644 --> 01:30:40.305
Congratulations, Deepak.

1231
01:30:40.379 --> 01:30:44.975
Thank you very much,
Mr. Hundert.
Good job.


1232
01:30:45.050 --> 01:30:47.883
I suppose if you're gonna lose,
you may as well lose to the brightest.

1234

And thanks again,
Mr. Hundert.


1235
01:30:56.161 --> 01:30:59.653
Your virtue is
a beacon of light.


1236
01:30:59.731 --> 01:31:03.167
All right, Mr. H...!

1237
01:31:03.235 --> 01:31:06.261
Oh, no, Mr. Hundert.
Please stay.


1238
01:31:07.439 --> 01:31:09.634
And thank you all.

1239
01:31:09.708 --> 01:31:11.642
We've had a great deal
of fun this weekend,


1240
01:31:11.710 --> 01:31:15.305
and we, uh, probably shouldn't
wait another 25 years
till we do it again.


1241
01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:18.042
[Man]
I'll say.


1242
01:31:18.116 --> 01:31:22.212
But there's a more serious side
to this gathering.


1243
01:31:22.287 --> 01:31:24.221
One that concerns
every one of us.


1244
01:31:24.289 --> 01:31:26.814
Because all of us here,
I believe,


1245
01:31:26.892 --> 01:31:29.360
care about the quality
of education in this country.


1246
01:31:29.428 --> 01:31:32.488
And not just at places
like Saint Benedict's,


1247
01:31:32.564 --> 01:31:35.761
not just for our children,

1248
01:31:35.834 --> 01:31:40.294
but for the nation's children.

1249
01:31:40.372 --> 01:31:43.864
Because we all care about
our country's future...


1250
01:31:43.942 --> 01:31:45.876
Marty...

1251
01:31:45.944 --> 01:31:48.174
about its moral leadership,

1252
01:31:48.247 --> 01:31:51.375
about its fiscal leadership.

1253
01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:55.511
And because we know that,
as a generation,


1254
01:31:55.587 --> 01:31:57.555
it is our time to lead.

1255
01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:04.551
And why I stand before you now,

1256
01:32:04.630 --> 01:32:08.760
to tell you my intentions
of following in the formidable
footsteps of my father,


1257
01:32:08.834 --> 01:32:12.565
and announce my bid for a seat
in the United States Senate.


1258
01:32:12.638 --> 01:32:16.472
And I want to ask you all
for your support.

He's got my vote.!

There's about, uh, 30 balding,
middle-aged men out there
looking for you, Professor.


1264
01:32:57.783 --> 01:33:00.616
Well, some things
can't wait.

1266

God, you were great
this evening.


1267
01:33:06.458 --> 01:33:09.985
You're like fine wine.
You improve with age.

Everything all right?

1270
01:33:16.368 --> 01:33:18.393
Yes, I'm fine.
Yeah? You don't...


1271
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:22.668
You don't look so fine.
I'm all right.
Thank you.


1272
01:33:24.509 --> 01:33:27.000
Well, then hurry up
and come join the celebration.


1273
01:33:29.915 --> 01:33:33.146

hard of hearing, Sedgewick?

you might've known.

Who's the poor mercenary
who was feeding you the answers?


1280
01:33:57.776 --> 01:34:02.475
Oh, just some graduate student.
Gave him a couple hundred bucks
and a warm meal.


1281
01:34:02.547 --> 01:34:05.846
I trust you'll keep this
between us.


1282
01:34:05.917 --> 01:34:07.851
As always.

1283
01:34:09.287 --> 01:34:11.812
I trust you will.

1284
01:34:14.326 --> 01:34:18.763
Do you mean am I going
to go out there...


1285
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:21.628
and expose you
for a liar and a cheat?


1286
01:34:21.700 --> 01:34:23.634
No.

1287
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:26.704
I'm a teacher, Sedgewick.

01:34:26.772 --> 01:34:30.503
And I failed you...

1289
01:34:30.575 --> 01:34:33.476
As a teacher.

1290
01:34:33.545 --> 01:34:36.173
But I will give you one last lecture,

1291
01:34:36.248 --> 01:34:38.307
if I may.

1292
01:34:38.383 --> 01:34:40.317
All of us,

1293
01:34:40.385 --> 01:34:44.048
at some point,
are forced...


1294
01:34:44.122 --> 01:34:46.647
to look at ourselves
in the mirror,


1295
01:34:46.725 --> 01:34:49.159
and see who we really are.

1296
01:34:49.227 --> 01:34:51.923
And when that day
comes for you, Sedgewick,


1297
01:34:51.997 --> 01:34:55.023
you will be confronted
with a life...

lived without virtue,

1299

without principle,

Honestly.

1305
01:35:16.922 --> 01:35:20.483
Who out there
gives a shit...


1306
01:35:20.559 --> 01:35:24.461
about your principles
and your virtues?

I mean, look at you.

What do you have
to show for yourself?


1309
01:35:31.837 --> 01:35:35.967
I live in the real world,
where people do what they need
to do to get what they want.


1310
01:35:36.041 --> 01:35:39.135
And if it's lying and it's cheating,
then so be it.


1311
01:35:39.211 --> 01:35:41.577
So, I am gonna
go out there,


1312
01:35:41.646 --> 01:35:44.308
and I am going to win
that election, Mr. Hundert,


1313
01:35:44.382 --> 01:35:46.509
and you will
see me everywhere.


1314
01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:50.888
And I'll worry
about my contribution later.

have a minute?

be here to see it.

Sedgewick was gonna
take it from him this time.

It was amazing.

to be you up there.

anything to you, but...

01:39:22.767 --> 01:39:27.170
Not at all.
But unfortunately
you've missed everyone.


1355
01:39:27.238 --> 01:39:29.798
Missed everyone?
Well, they seemed
to be rather in a hurry.


1356
01:39:29.874 --> 01:39:31.808
Some of them
had planes to catch.


1357
01:39:31.876 --> 01:39:34.401
But they did say
to say good-bye to you.


1358
01:39:34.479 --> 01:39:37.937
I'm sure I could find you
something to eat if you'd like.


1359
01:39:38.016 --> 01:39:40.041
No, no. Thank you.

[Chattering, Indistinct]

Get a picture really quick.
There it is.


1364
01:40:15.487 --> 01:40:18.354
[Shutter Clicks]
Look at him.
He looks great.


1365
01:40:18.423 --> 01:40:20.891
Oh, the bat!
Gimme the bat, the bat.


1366
01:40:20.959 --> 01:40:23.928
Mr... Mr. Hundert, we have
something we'd like
to present to you.

who could make Homer a hit,

our slugger, Mr. Hundert.

1369
01:40:28.666 --> 01:40:30.759
[Laughter]
Do you remember?


1370
01:40:30.835 --> 01:40:33.998
I remember.
Hey, be careful of
the window over there, Mr. H...!


1371
01:40:34.072 --> 01:40:39.032
Eloquently put, Mr. Masoudi,
et al.
Uh, thank you.


1372
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:41.874
Deepak, the, uh,
the, uh, plaque.

Whatever I may have
taught you gentlemen,


1384
01:41:21.252 --> 01:41:23.516
um, many years ago,

1385
01:41:23.588 --> 01:41:25.522
I want to thank you
for this weekend,


1386
01:41:25.590 --> 01:41:28.718
because you
have taught me something...


1387
01:41:28.793 --> 01:41:31.421
of inestimable value.

1388
01:41:31.496 --> 01:41:34.693
Thank you.

01:41:34.766 --> 01:41:37.633
To Mr. Hundert.
To you, sir.!

[Helicopter Whirring]

1394
01:41:48.246 --> 01:41:52.342
I had come here in the hope
that I had been wrong
about Sedgewick Bell.


1395
01:41:52.417 --> 01:41:54.977
Or rather,
that I had been right...


1396
01:41:55.053 --> 01:41:58.284
right to believe in him
all those years ago.


1397
01:41:58.356 --> 01:42:02.349
But this is a story
without surprises.


1398
01:42:02.427 --> 01:42:04.361
As a student of history,
I could be shocked...


1399
01:42:04.429 --> 01:42:07.990
neither by his audacity,
nor his success.


1400
01:42:08.066 --> 01:42:10.000
I had failed Sedgewick.

1401
01:42:10.068 --> 01:42:12.002
But the worth of a life
is not determined...


1402
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:15.801
by a single failure,
or a solitary success.


1403
01:42:15.874 --> 01:42:19.833
My other students
taught me that.


1404
01:42:20.778 --> 01:42:22.712
However much we stumble,

1405
01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:25.010
it is a teacher's burden
always to hope...


1406
01:42:25.083 --> 01:42:29.042
that with learning, a boy's
character might be changed.


1407
01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:32.055
And, so,
the destiny of a man.
