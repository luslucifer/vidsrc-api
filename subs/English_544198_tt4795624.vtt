1
00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.869
- I know
you have it in you.


2
00:00:29.903 --> 00:00:30.902
Bring it out.

3
00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.765
Bring it out.

4
00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:36.869
Bring it out.

5
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.248
- You've got the item?

6
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.903
- As promised.

7
00:00:55.938 --> 00:00:59.352
You'll never be
able to.


8
00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:02.490
â™ª Ooh

9
00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:49.938
- It wasn't that long
ago when it all went down.


10
00:01:49.972 --> 00:01:52.662
Sure, the bullets, the
blood and the bodies


11
00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:55.179
have all been cleaned
up by now, but,


12
00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:59.041
psychologically, the damage
had already been done.


13
00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:00.903
That's where I come in.

14
00:02:00.938 --> 00:02:02.455
It all started
with Jackson Bolt.


15
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.110
I did my best to clean up
that brother's head, but...


16
00:02:06.145 --> 00:02:08.352
God, I tried, I really did.

17
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:16.420
- Jackson.

18
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.386
What?

19
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:19.420
Jackson.

20
00:02:23.938 --> 00:02:25.352
- You're not listening to me.

21
00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:27.386
- Wait.

22
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:28.559
Jackson.

23
00:02:28.593 --> 00:02:30.765
Jackson, listen to me.

24
00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:32.397
- 'Cause
he's always over there.


25
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:33.352
- This is what
I'm talking about.


26
00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:35.145
You never listen.

27
00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:36.834
- Darla, we do this every time.

28
00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.972
Hold on a minute.

29
00:02:39.007 --> 00:02:40.006
- Where are you?

30
00:02:40.938 --> 00:02:42.086
- Don't
come any closer, man.


31
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.421
I don't wanna fucking shoot you.

32
00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:44.386
- You're
not gonna shoot me.


33
00:02:44.421 --> 00:02:45.662
Your safety's on.

34
00:03:03.628 --> 00:03:04.765
You know something?

35
00:03:05.834 --> 00:03:07.765
- Is that gunfire I can hear?

36
00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.696
- He better
not be wearing my robe.


37
00:03:10.834 --> 00:03:11.628
- You know, you know what?

38
00:03:11.662 --> 00:03:12.834
Forget it.

39
00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:14.588
- I don't
have time for this shit.


40
00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:17.385
- Kinda like this.

41
00:04:30.455 --> 00:04:32.179
- Can't believe
you killed 'em all.


42
00:04:34.938 --> 00:04:35.937
- Pow.

43
00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:45.490
- This is it, right?

44
00:04:45.524 --> 00:04:46.523
- Yep.

45
00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:50.247
- Everything?

46
00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:53.178
- Yeah.

47
00:04:55.455 --> 00:04:56.454
- Get out.

48
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:58.983
- Seems like
I was in Tommy's office


49
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:01.903
every other week, right
after another blood bath.


50
00:05:01.938 --> 00:05:03.592
But I didn't care.

51
00:05:03.627 --> 00:05:06.110
We kept him busy and it
kept the streets clean.


52
00:05:12.214 --> 00:05:15.041
Let's take a minute to meet
a couple of shall we say,


53
00:05:15.076 --> 00:05:16.938
service providers.

54
00:05:16.972 --> 00:05:20.558
They go by the name of Sky
Malone and Diamond Doll.


55
00:05:20.592 --> 00:05:21.637
They were always
trying to get away


56
00:05:21.661 --> 00:05:24.765
from their lowlife pimp, Jimmy.

57
00:05:30.765 --> 00:05:32.041
- What happened?

58
00:05:33.421 --> 00:05:37.007
- I almost threw myself
in front of a bus, but


59
00:05:37.041 --> 00:05:39.110
I keep seeing Naomi's face.

60
00:05:40.696 --> 00:05:42.386
- Listen to me.

61
00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:44.352
We're gonna get through this.

62
00:05:44.386 --> 00:05:45.421
I have a plan.

63
00:05:46.627 --> 00:05:48.627
I've been hiding money
in the trunk of my car,


64
00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:49.972
under the spare tire.

65
00:05:51.903 --> 00:05:53.696
Got exactly 2,500.

66
00:05:55.523 --> 00:05:57.214
All I need is 15.

67
00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:07.041
Found a guy, I'm gonna
pay him to kill Jimmy


68
00:06:08.214 --> 00:06:10.523
and we can leave this shithole.

69
00:06:10.558 --> 00:06:12.627
- Yeah, we'll we're
gonna get caught.


70
00:06:12.661 --> 00:06:15.248
- That's why I want you
to follow behind me.


71
00:06:15.283 --> 00:06:17.007
You make sure no
one's at my back.


72
00:06:21.041 --> 00:06:22.627
It's gonna be okay.

73
00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:25.316
- Okay.

74
00:06:28.869 --> 00:06:31.386
You're gonna see Naomi again.

75
00:06:31.421 --> 00:06:32.627
- Okay.

76
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:34.020
- You're gonna see
your baby again.


77
00:06:51.627 --> 00:06:54.110
- I really
did my job well,


78
00:06:54.145 --> 00:06:56.972
but damn, my home
life was a wreck.


79
00:06:58.007 --> 00:06:59.592
- I want us to work.

80
00:07:03.765 --> 00:07:05.869
Work, that's the problem.

81
00:07:08.523 --> 00:07:10.627
God, Jackson, I do miss you.

82
00:07:20.903 --> 00:07:21.902
- Darla.

83
00:07:25.248 --> 00:07:26.465
- I was just thinking about you.

84
00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:28.041
- I hope that's a good thing.

85
00:07:28.076 --> 00:07:28.972
- I think I can--

86
00:07:29.007 --> 00:07:30.454
- I've been thinking Darla.

87
00:07:30.489 --> 00:07:32.938
I'm not gonna take every case
that comes down the pike.


88
00:07:35.352 --> 00:07:36.454
How's your mom?

89
00:07:38.076 --> 00:07:40.489
- She's not happy I'm here
back in London, though.


90
00:07:40.523 --> 00:07:41.522
- Yeah.

91
00:07:42.352 --> 00:07:44.041
- I want us to work, Jackson.

92
00:07:44.076 --> 00:07:45.248
I really do.

93
00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.489
- I promise I won't
blow it this time.


94
00:07:50.592 --> 00:07:52.179
Just come home.

95
00:07:52.214 --> 00:07:54.592
- I'll be home soon.

96
00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:23.361
- I didn't
take your skateboard.


97
00:09:23.385 --> 00:09:24.558
- I know you took it.

98
00:09:24.592 --> 00:09:25.637
- I don't even have
your skateboard.


99
00:09:25.661 --> 00:09:27.523
- I know, you liar.

100
00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:29.214
- I didn't
take your skateboard.


101
00:09:30.179 --> 00:09:31.972
- Follow me.

102
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:36.730
- Hey Sarge, got her again.

103
00:09:36.765 --> 00:09:38.351
Maybe she shouldn't wear red.

104
00:09:38.385 --> 00:09:39.696
- I like it.

105
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.041
- Wanna book her?

106
00:09:41.076 --> 00:09:42.075
- Yeah.

107
00:09:44.489 --> 00:09:45.637
- Can you help me find my dog?

108
00:09:45.661 --> 00:09:47.282
His name is Jovar.

109
00:09:47.316 --> 00:09:48.420
He's this small.

110
00:09:51.316 --> 00:09:53.938
- Sergeant, I need your
attention on this right away.


111
00:09:55.282 --> 00:09:56.558
And help her find her dog.

112
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.972
- Me, trying
to be a super cop,


113
00:10:19.007 --> 00:10:22.351
I totally ignored the one
person I loved the most.


114
00:10:22.385 --> 00:10:23.384
Darla.

115
00:10:24.316 --> 00:10:25.420
Damn, I miss her.

116
00:10:31.765 --> 00:10:32.983
- Sorry, no one

117
00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:34.385
is available to
accept your call.


118
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.420
Please leave a message
after the tone.


119
00:10:37.661 --> 00:10:39.247
- Hi Darla.

120
00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.420
I don't know how we got here.

121
00:10:46.454 --> 00:10:47.869
All I know is that I miss you.

122
00:10:50.214 --> 00:10:51.558
I hope you get this message.

123
00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:55.350
I love you.

124
00:11:37.834 --> 00:11:39.110
This is Jimmy.

125
00:11:39.145 --> 00:11:41.661
He's the lowlife scum
of a human being pimp.


126
00:11:41.696 --> 00:11:43.454
He's the poster
boy for depravity.


127
00:11:43.489 --> 00:11:45.316
- Are all the little
fillies in my stable


128
00:11:45.351 --> 00:11:47.145
in a bad mood today?

129
00:11:47.178 --> 00:11:49.351
- How many more months
do I have to pay interest


130
00:11:49.385 --> 00:11:54.316
with my ass, literally,
to Bobby fucking No Nose?


131
00:11:55.558 --> 00:11:57.110
- 'Til Christmas.

132
00:11:57.145 --> 00:11:59.972
- I don't think I can
make it past Halloween.


133
00:12:00.007 --> 00:12:01.903
- Next time you
won't be so eager


134
00:12:01.938 --> 00:12:03.454
to borrow money from the mob.

135
00:12:04.558 --> 00:12:06.282
Payback's a bitch, isn't it?

136
00:12:13.316 --> 00:12:16.316
- Once I pay off
Bobby and pay you off,


137
00:12:16.351 --> 00:12:18.041
I need a little vacation.

138
00:12:19.938 --> 00:12:21.144
- Where are we gonna go?

139
00:12:21.178 --> 00:12:25.765
- No, I said I need
a little vacation.


140
00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:26.798
- Yeah?

141
00:12:27.592 --> 00:12:28.972
That reminds me.

142
00:12:29.007 --> 00:12:30.247
Bobby called.

143
00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:33.041
He needs his next
party this Sunday,


144
00:12:33.076 --> 00:12:34.799
right after nine o'clock mass.

145
00:12:39.282 --> 00:12:43.178
- Do you have any
compassion for anyone?


146
00:12:43.213 --> 00:12:44.282
- Yeah, for me.

147
00:12:56.282 --> 00:13:00.213
- Yeah, Jimmy had
a real way with the ladies.


148
00:13:14.109 --> 00:13:15.282
- Where the hell's Bolt?

149
00:13:17.938 --> 00:13:18.938
Get your ass in here.

150
00:13:22.075 --> 00:13:23.258
- And it
seems like I was in


151
00:13:23.282 --> 00:13:25.730
the chief's office
every other week, too.


152
00:13:25.765 --> 00:13:27.351
- Sit down.

153
00:13:27.385 --> 00:13:28.396
- I might
as well have my name


154
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:29.454
on the office door.

155
00:13:33.385 --> 00:13:34.558
- You know what this is?

156
00:13:34.592 --> 00:13:35.696
Tommy's report on you.

157
00:13:36.627 --> 00:13:37.626
It's bullshit.

158
00:13:39.144 --> 00:13:41.558
On top of that, I've
got the D.A. on my--


159
00:13:41.592 --> 00:13:43.178
- Chief Stone.

160
00:13:43.213 --> 00:13:47.385
Just the man I
wanna see behind bars.


161
00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.765
And you're gonna make it happen,

162
00:13:48.799 --> 00:13:51.592
so help me or it's
your ass, too.


163
00:13:51.627 --> 00:13:53.085
Jackson, you have
screwed this division


164
00:13:53.109 --> 00:13:54.627
for the last time.

165
00:13:54.661 --> 00:13:55.660
You're going down.

166
00:14:00.385 --> 00:14:02.420
- I can't keep
putting up with this.


167
00:14:02.454 --> 00:14:04.420
I can't keep covering
for your ass.


168
00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:07.074
Are you drinking?

169
00:14:10.489 --> 00:14:12.558
Get your personal shit
together, will you?


170
00:14:15.213 --> 00:14:16.212
Get West in here.

171
00:14:32.385 --> 00:14:35.040
This is a buddy of yours.

172
00:14:35.075 --> 00:14:36.247
You gotta check him out.

173
00:14:37.454 --> 00:14:39.351
And you two, get your
shit together, too.


174
00:14:45.282 --> 00:14:46.281
Well?

175
00:14:47.075 --> 00:14:48.074
Go.

176
00:15:10.454 --> 00:15:12.075
- Bobbo, hey.

177
00:15:12.109 --> 00:15:14.523
Yeah, yeah, we got
it set up for Sunday.


178
00:15:14.558 --> 00:15:16.489
Yeah, I wanna get you two,

179
00:15:16.523 --> 00:15:18.006
no, okay, okay one's enough.

180
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:19.051
Yeah, you're gonna like her.

181
00:15:19.075 --> 00:15:21.109
Okay, have a great day and

182
00:15:21.144 --> 00:15:23.109
got another call
coming in thanks.


183
00:15:23.144 --> 00:15:24.316
Vince.

184
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:25.523
Hey, I'm glad you called.

185
00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:27.085
Yes, I was gonna tell
you the good news.


186
00:15:27.109 --> 00:15:29.869
Everything is going really well

187
00:15:29.903 --> 00:15:32.765
and I'm gonna get those
files from you Tuesday


188
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.592
and I think the new office

189
00:15:35.627 --> 00:15:38.765
is gonna be open by wuh,
excuse me just a sec.


190
00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:41.627
Excuse me?

191
00:15:41.661 --> 00:15:44.075
You're coming out here
looking like this?


192
00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:45.489
Go fucking change.

193
00:15:46.454 --> 00:15:47.869
Go.

194
00:15:50.454 --> 00:15:52.937
Anyway, what I was saying
is, I think that things


195
00:15:52.971 --> 00:15:55.489
are gonna be pretty cool because

196
00:15:55.523 --> 00:16:01.282
once we get these girls out
and get new business going,


197
00:16:01.316 --> 00:16:03.661
I think I'm gonna be happier.

198
00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:05.351
You wouldn't believe
what I go through.


199
00:16:05.385 --> 00:16:10.247
My God, it's, all the
meditation, all the drugs,


200
00:16:10.282 --> 00:16:12.937
all the praying in the
world hasn't helped.


201
00:16:12.971 --> 00:16:15.869
These girls just don't
really know their job.


202
00:16:17.316 --> 00:16:19.765
Look, I'm gonna have
to call you back.


203
00:16:24.075 --> 00:16:25.765
- I got raped tonight.

204
00:16:29.282 --> 00:16:31.213
- You're a dirty little whore.

205
00:16:31.247 --> 00:16:34.937
That's kinda like saying a
boxer got beat up or something.


206
00:16:34.971 --> 00:16:36.696
Who cares?

207
00:16:37.869 --> 00:16:38.869
God.

208
00:16:38.902 --> 00:16:40.178
- I can't keep doing this.

209
00:16:42.316 --> 00:16:45.282
I wanna see my mom and my baby.

210
00:16:47.351 --> 00:16:49.765
- And you will, I
promise, very soon.


211
00:16:51.661 --> 00:16:53.454
- I wanna hold my baby.

212
00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:55.419
- I know.

213
00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:59.937
And you keep saying this but
focus on business.


214
00:16:59.971 --> 00:17:01.178
Okay?

215
00:17:01.213 --> 00:17:02.465
I've got some things
coming down the pike.


216
00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:03.534
I can't really tell
you about everything


217
00:17:03.558 --> 00:17:05.420
but everything's gonna change

218
00:17:05.454 --> 00:17:08.902
and you're gonna be a
free woman very, very soon


219
00:17:08.937 --> 00:17:10.902
but you gotta keep
your little mouth shut


220
00:17:10.937 --> 00:17:13.351
unless I tell you to open
it for certain things,


221
00:17:13.385 --> 00:17:14.937
if you know what I mean, okay?

222
00:17:19.454 --> 00:17:21.730
- I was raped tonight!

223
00:17:21.765 --> 00:17:23.937
- God sakes, woman.

224
00:17:23.971 --> 00:17:26.213
I'm trying to run
a business here.


225
00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:17.558
- Get your ass back in the car.

226
00:18:17.592 --> 00:18:18.454
- Who the fuck you
think you're talking to?


227
00:18:18.489 --> 00:18:19.558
- I'm talking to you, man.

228
00:18:19.592 --> 00:18:22.040
Get your ass back in the car.

229
00:18:25.489 --> 00:18:26.523
- Hey, hey.

230
00:18:26.558 --> 00:18:28.213
What's going on here?

231
00:18:32.178 --> 00:18:33.177
- Toy cop.

232
00:18:35.109 --> 00:18:36.592
- You guys accepting
applications?


233
00:18:36.627 --> 00:18:38.154
- The tip came in
that my old fight promoter


234
00:18:38.178 --> 00:18:39.937
was doing something illegal.

235
00:18:39.971 --> 00:18:41.696
Hi, can I help you?

236
00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:42.947
- I'm
here to see Danny.


237
00:18:42.971 --> 00:18:44.690
- Do you
have an appointment?


238
00:18:45.592 --> 00:18:47.282
- So, I
do what I do best.


239
00:19:00.213 --> 00:19:01.592
- I got the delivery.

240
00:19:05.971 --> 00:19:07.558
- Danny, Danny, Danny.

241
00:19:08.764 --> 00:19:09.696
- Just because
you killed somebody


242
00:19:09.729 --> 00:19:12.178
in the ring, you pussy out.

243
00:19:13.696 --> 00:19:16.798
And you cost me millions.

244
00:19:16.833 --> 00:19:18.489
- You know why I'm here.

245
00:19:18.523 --> 00:19:20.040
What is it this time?

246
00:19:20.075 --> 00:19:24.144
Gambling, prostitution?

247
00:19:24.178 --> 00:19:27.420
- No, I play chess.

248
00:20:15.764 --> 00:20:17.144
- Stop, ha!

249
00:20:33.385 --> 00:20:34.384
- Yeah?

250
00:20:37.558 --> 00:20:38.971
You guys are coming up short.

251
00:20:42.178 --> 00:20:44.075
Need to get your
asses over to 42.


252
00:20:45.385 --> 00:20:46.384
Like now.

253
00:20:50.523 --> 00:20:51.522
Now.

254
00:21:01.798 --> 00:21:03.040
Hey, wake up.

255
00:21:12.006 --> 00:21:13.626
- See ya tonight after business.

256
00:21:20.798 --> 00:21:22.523
- Little light on the weight.

257
00:21:22.558 --> 00:21:23.833
- Here you go pops.

258
00:21:24.695 --> 00:21:26.213
Bye.

259
00:21:26.247 --> 00:21:27.213
- Can you
do a fucking lightweight?


260
00:21:27.247 --> 00:21:28.040
Come on, man.

261
00:21:28.075 --> 00:21:28.971
- Don't worry about it.

262
00:21:29.006 --> 00:21:29.902
It's not your fucking problem.

263
00:21:29.937 --> 00:21:31.075
- Took you so fucking long?

264
00:21:31.109 --> 00:21:32.764
- I was only up
there for 10 minutes.


265
00:21:32.798 --> 00:21:33.591
- You was up there
for 20 minutes--


266
00:21:33.626 --> 00:21:34.729
- Whatever, man.

267
00:21:37.144 --> 00:21:37.937
- What the
fuck happened--


268
00:21:37.971 --> 00:21:38.970
- Man, get outta here.

269
00:21:41.902 --> 00:21:43.075
- How's Darla?

270
00:21:43.109 --> 00:21:44.108
- That's it.

271
00:21:45.109 --> 00:21:45.971
Get outta the car.

272
00:21:46.006 --> 00:21:47.005
- What?

273
00:21:52.557 --> 00:21:54.316
- I'm so tired of
your shit, man.


274
00:21:54.351 --> 00:21:55.626
Tired of your shit.

275
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.979
- What you pushing
on me for, man?


276
00:21:58.247 --> 00:21:59.420
The fuck, Bolt?

277
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.247
We're partners man!

278
00:22:04.282 --> 00:22:05.385
You can't do this.

279
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:06.902
- He was lucky.

280
00:22:06.937 --> 00:22:10.660
I felt like shit, but a call
came in about a drug deal


281
00:22:10.695 --> 00:22:13.075
going down in one of
Danny's apartments.


282
00:22:42.247 --> 00:22:43.591
- Fuckin' bitch.

283
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.040
Mother fuck.

284
00:22:54.075 --> 00:22:55.074
- What's up?

285
00:23:05.178 --> 00:23:06.177
- Efficient.

286
00:23:12.247 --> 00:23:14.557
- Fuck.

287
00:23:14.591 --> 00:23:15.971
Punk mother fucker.

288
00:23:25.282 --> 00:23:27.144
Son of fucking bitch.

289
00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.218
- My God, what the
hell's going on in here?


290
00:23:41.798 --> 00:23:44.488
- Before you go out, be
sure mess.


291
00:23:46.453 --> 00:23:47.452
- Screw yourself.

292
00:23:54.591 --> 00:23:56.971
- West, freeze.

293
00:23:57.006 --> 00:23:59.189
But then I realized I couldn't
pull the trigger on my gun.


294
00:23:59.213 --> 00:24:00.247
- Matter?

295
00:24:00.282 --> 00:24:01.420
Can't pull the trigger?

296
00:24:01.453 --> 00:24:02.557
Let me help you.

297
00:24:14.006 --> 00:24:16.419
Managed to slip through the
hands of some rookie cops.


298
00:24:34.971 --> 00:24:39.006
Diamond's 11:30 john found
her dead and called 9-1-1.


299
00:25:10.144 --> 00:25:12.557
While Jimmy rejoiced over
the paramedic's inability


300
00:25:12.591 --> 00:25:14.764
to resuscitate
Diamond, Sky was busy


301
00:25:14.798 --> 00:25:15.971
doing what she needed to do

302
00:25:16.006 --> 00:25:18.178
to make a downpayment
on Jimmy's demise.


303
00:25:29.764 --> 00:25:33.695
Jimmy cried like he cared,
but it was all just an act.


304
00:25:33.729 --> 00:25:35.591
Jimmy had a real
way with the ladies.


305
00:25:41.213 --> 00:25:44.040
- Yeah, I know, I
know, he's a problem,


306
00:25:44.075 --> 00:25:46.075
but it's our problem, not yours.

307
00:25:46.109 --> 00:25:47.384
Look, just do your job.

308
00:25:47.419 --> 00:25:48.418
We'll do ours.

309
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.660
- You wanted to see me, Chief?

310
00:25:56.695 --> 00:25:57.694
- Yeah.

311
00:25:58.729 --> 00:26:01.384
I had you transferred
here for a reason.


312
00:26:01.419 --> 00:26:04.453
Your buddy's in trouble
and you're gonna watch him.


313
00:26:06.419 --> 00:26:07.971
And you can start with his wife.

314
00:26:09.109 --> 00:26:10.798
But not like West.

315
00:26:14.247 --> 00:26:16.453
- David, is
this really necessary?


316
00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.419
- Darla, you and I both know
Jackson didn't kill anybody.


317
00:26:23.695 --> 00:26:24.694
His partner.

318
00:26:25.833 --> 00:26:27.109
I've got one word for you.

319
00:26:28.833 --> 00:26:30.419
Framed.

320
00:26:30.453 --> 00:26:33.247
- Look, I can assure
you he is not here.


321
00:26:33.281 --> 00:26:36.384
If you want to protect me, you
can do it from outside, okay?


322
00:26:37.868 --> 00:26:40.178
Now, I'm gonna go
upstairs to rest


323
00:26:40.213 --> 00:26:43.419
and when I wake up, I
want you out of my house.


324
00:26:47.626 --> 00:26:48.902
- I know he's here, Darla.

325
00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:10.833
- Hey.

326
00:27:10.868 --> 00:27:12.488
- Good job, baby.

327
00:27:12.522 --> 00:27:14.660
- He's gone, I think we're safe.

328
00:27:14.695 --> 00:27:16.522
- He's the only one I trust.

329
00:27:16.557 --> 00:27:17.798
- I know.

330
00:27:17.833 --> 00:27:18.832
- Hey.

331
00:27:21.626 --> 00:27:24.764
I need you to give him
this cell phone, okay?


332
00:27:24.798 --> 00:27:26.937
Don't let anybody see you do it.

333
00:27:26.971 --> 00:27:27.970
- Okay.

334
00:27:28.971 --> 00:27:30.868
- I'm gonna follow
up on a few things,


335
00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:37.937
kill some people and call
him in the morning, alright?


336
00:27:38.798 --> 00:27:40.075
- I gotta go.

337
00:27:40.109 --> 00:27:41.315
- Okay.

338
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:42.281
- I miss you.

339
00:27:42.315 --> 00:27:43.729
- I miss you, too.

340
00:27:47.798 --> 00:27:49.660
- Remember the time
when we went swimming


341
00:27:49.695 --> 00:27:51.075
and you fell in the pool?

342
00:27:52.833 --> 00:27:54.868
- Yes, I remember the time.

343
00:27:57.315 --> 00:27:58.314
- Those were good times.

344
00:28:05.695 --> 00:28:09.109
- When this is all over,
we need to talk, okay?


345
00:28:12.246 --> 00:28:13.245
- Okay.

346
00:28:44.902 --> 00:28:48.281
According to the news, that
man Bolt was on the run,


347
00:28:48.315 --> 00:28:50.729
but I was actually on the hunt.

348
00:28:50.764 --> 00:28:52.120
- Hey David, I got a
line on that Texas game.


349
00:28:52.143 --> 00:28:53.075
You in?

350
00:28:53.109 --> 00:28:53.868
- Yeah, man, I'm down.

351
00:28:53.902 --> 00:28:54.695
- Let's do it.

352
00:28:54.729 --> 00:28:55.728
- Let's do that.

353
00:28:58.419 --> 00:28:59.246
Hello?

354
00:28:59.281 --> 00:29:00.384
- David, hey it's J.B.

355
00:29:01.729 --> 00:29:03.177
You got anything on Danny?

356
00:29:03.212 --> 00:29:05.246
- Nah, and do I got
something for you.


357
00:29:05.281 --> 00:29:06.533
- How about
making that bet partner?


358
00:29:06.557 --> 00:29:08.177
- Get outta here.

359
00:29:09.695 --> 00:29:11.878
He's got this big old fight
lined up for Saturday night.


360
00:29:11.902 --> 00:29:14.729
Yeah, supposed to be
five guys against one.


361
00:29:14.764 --> 00:29:15.557
- This Saturday?

362
00:29:15.591 --> 00:29:16.453
Like, in a few days?

363
00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:17.315
- Yeah.

364
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.868
- Are there any details?

365
00:29:18.902 --> 00:29:21.488
- The who's who of fighters
and some surprise kickboxer.


366
00:29:21.522 --> 00:29:23.798
Yeah, some sort of mystery man.

367
00:29:23.833 --> 00:29:26.075
- Yeah, I think I know
who the kickboxer is.


368
00:29:26.108 --> 00:29:27.108
- Yeah.

369
00:29:27.143 --> 00:29:27.937
- Is there a website?

370
00:29:27.971 --> 00:29:29.315
- No website.

371
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.833
- Look, man.

372
00:29:30.868 --> 00:29:33.006
I got a little problem I
need you to help me with.


373
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.281
- So, that's why
your wife left you.


374
00:29:36.315 --> 00:29:38.626
- Man, I'm gonna kick your ass.

375
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.212
- Too soon?

376
00:29:40.246 --> 00:29:41.591
- Got this pain in my head.

377
00:29:42.971 --> 00:29:45.177
My God, it's ringing, it hurts.

378
00:29:45.212 --> 00:29:46.729
Can't pull the
trigger on my gun.


379
00:29:46.764 --> 00:29:47.729
- What?

380
00:29:47.764 --> 00:29:49.453
- I need you to research Danny.

381
00:29:49.488 --> 00:29:50.902
I'll catch up with you later.

382
00:29:54.591 --> 00:29:56.384
You can find Danny
in one of two places.


383
00:29:56.419 --> 00:29:58.315
His office or his bar.

384
00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.488
I decided to start
with his office.


385
00:30:00.522 --> 00:30:03.384
There was something about that
silver briefcase on his desk.


386
00:30:03.419 --> 00:30:05.281
I just had to know
what was in it.


387
00:30:05.315 --> 00:30:06.314
Hey!

388
00:30:23.315 --> 00:30:24.143
- Freeze!

389
00:30:24.177 --> 00:30:25.176
Don't move.

390
00:30:31.108 --> 00:30:32.107
Toy cop?

391
00:30:37.868 --> 00:30:38.867
- Toy cop.

392
00:30:51.695 --> 00:30:53.350
Sky had everything planned out.

393
00:30:56.212 --> 00:30:57.533
What she needed to do
was bring the money


394
00:30:57.557 --> 00:30:59.522
to a guy in the suit,
sitting by the window


395
00:30:59.557 --> 00:31:01.695
at the coffee shop
at a certain time.


396
00:31:01.729 --> 00:31:03.350
What could possibly go wrong?

397
00:31:06.315 --> 00:31:10.005
- Looks like we both clean
up pretty well, don't we?


398
00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:13.350
- I was just gonna get coffee.

399
00:31:13.384 --> 00:31:15.384
I was gonna see if you
wanted anything, too.


400
00:31:15.419 --> 00:31:16.937
- I want a lot,

401
00:31:16.971 --> 00:31:19.246
starting with your pretty
little ass in this chair.


402
00:31:25.315 --> 00:31:28.695
You know I was up all
night tossing and turning,


403
00:31:28.729 --> 00:31:32.902
agonizing over what to tell
you about my new business.


404
00:31:32.937 --> 00:31:34.557
- What new business?

405
00:31:35.626 --> 00:31:39.764
- My brother is a hired killer.

406
00:31:49.591 --> 00:31:52.143
He's been teaching
me everything.


407
00:31:52.177 --> 00:31:53.868
Pretty cool?

408
00:31:53.902 --> 00:31:56.177
- Can I get
you something to drink?


409
00:31:56.212 --> 00:31:58.039
You're good for now?

410
00:31:58.074 --> 00:31:59.557
- I'm doing fine, thank you.

411
00:32:02.557 --> 00:32:06.660
I did my first practice kill
last night and I love it.


412
00:32:06.695 --> 00:32:09.005
It's even better
than peddling flesh.


413
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.039
The other thing that I
haven't been telling you


414
00:32:13.074 --> 00:32:15.453
is that every day I have
to make a phone call


415
00:32:15.488 --> 00:32:18.798
to my brother down
in L.A. and every day


416
00:32:18.833 --> 00:32:22.453
I have to remind him not
to kill that nice woman


417
00:32:24.005 --> 00:32:27.902
and not to kill that
little bastard baby.


418
00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:31.453
And I have to tell him

419
00:32:32.798 --> 00:32:37.453
not to go to 4999
Manchester Circle.


420
00:32:39.522 --> 00:32:41.246
Apartment 18.

421
00:32:43.384 --> 00:32:44.764
- You know what, Jimmy?

422
00:32:44.798 --> 00:32:47.626
Someday, you're not
gonna hold all the cards,


423
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.557
and when that day comes,
you're gonna be sorry.


424
00:32:53.453 --> 00:32:57.039
- Here's to that day being
many years in the future.


425
00:32:57.074 --> 00:32:59.039
- I'd spit in your
fuckin' face right now


426
00:32:59.074 --> 00:33:01.108
if I didn't know that
you'd like it so much.


427
00:33:01.143 --> 00:33:03.695
- You paint me to
be such a perv, Sky.


428
00:33:03.729 --> 00:33:05.488
But look at yourself.

429
00:33:05.522 --> 00:33:08.177
- I'm paying for my sins, okay?

430
00:33:08.212 --> 00:33:10.419
At least I'm trying.

431
00:33:10.453 --> 00:33:11.452
You.

432
00:33:12.764 --> 00:33:16.315
Someone's gonna come along
and have to make you pay.


433
00:33:16.350 --> 00:33:18.005
- I can't wait.

434
00:33:21.901 --> 00:33:24.384
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I am Cecil J. Blondie,


435
00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:25.695
at least I used to be.

436
00:33:25.729 --> 00:33:27.660
So good to see you all
coming out here today


437
00:33:27.695 --> 00:33:29.970
to Sergeant Pepper's,
especially you, Frank.


438
00:33:30.005 --> 00:33:32.005
We've got a great show
for you lined up today


439
00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:34.153
as long as Jennifer remembers
to kick a little higher,


440
00:33:34.177 --> 00:33:35.740
keep her leg in the
air and it shouldn't be


441
00:33:35.764 --> 00:33:37.901
too much of a stretch
for her, we like to hope.


442
00:33:37.936 --> 00:33:39.350
Go ahead and put
your hands together


443
00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:42.039
but keep it in your
pants for the Frat Girls!


444
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:55.212
- Okay, let's start with
the burlesque stab and go.


445
00:33:56.695 --> 00:33:57.694
Slap.

446
00:34:06.695 --> 00:34:09.177
- Yeah, babies, come on.

447
00:34:10.901 --> 00:34:13.108
- Hey there, hey, hey, hey.

448
00:34:13.143 --> 00:34:14.142
- Son of a bitch!

449
00:34:14.798 --> 00:34:16.281
- Get out.

450
00:34:29.039 --> 00:34:30.050
- My bout
with depression


451
00:34:30.074 --> 00:34:32.039
was getting worse and worse.

452
00:34:32.074 --> 00:34:34.488
Killing Danny may not
prove my innocence,


453
00:34:34.522 --> 00:34:37.039
but it just might cheer
me up a little bit.


454
00:34:37.074 --> 00:34:38.246
- Jackson Bolt.

455
00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:41.315
Hard time as always, my brother.

456
00:34:44.384 --> 00:34:46.384
- Give me one reason
why I shouldn't fuckin'


457
00:34:46.419 --> 00:34:48.350
kill you right now.

458
00:34:48.384 --> 00:34:49.901
- Jackson.

459
00:34:49.936 --> 00:34:52.488
'Cause I'm the guy with
an eyewitness that knows


460
00:34:52.522 --> 00:34:53.936
you didn't really kill anybody.

461
00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:55.522
- But that would implicate you.

462
00:34:55.557 --> 00:34:58.867
- I never let the truth get
in the way of a good story.


463
00:34:58.901 --> 00:35:00.005
- I'm not following.

464
00:35:00.039 --> 00:35:01.522
- And you never will,

465
00:35:01.557 --> 00:35:03.222
because while you're running
around playing checkers,


466
00:35:03.246 --> 00:35:04.729
I'm playing a
thinking man's game.


467
00:35:04.763 --> 00:35:07.143
A civilized game, chess.

468
00:35:07.177 --> 00:35:09.763
It's more civilized
and highly profitable.


469
00:35:09.797 --> 00:35:13.005
You see, half these cops,
they wanna kill you.


470
00:35:13.039 --> 00:35:16.074
The other half, well,
your partner was no saint.


471
00:35:16.108 --> 00:35:18.039
He was screwing a
bunch of guys' wives.


472
00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:29.005
- Fuck you
and your badge.


473
00:37:11.832 --> 00:37:12.831
- Bitch.

474
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:18.936
- Hoo hooey, Jackson.

475
00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:20.728
You still got it, boy.

476
00:37:20.763 --> 00:37:25.143
But remember my friend,
king beats pawn every time.


477
00:37:26.315 --> 00:37:27.429
- Pretty sure
that was an audition


478
00:37:27.453 --> 00:37:29.039
for Danny's event in a few days.

479
00:37:30.315 --> 00:37:31.694
What the hell was he up to?

480
00:37:40.728 --> 00:37:43.728
- Hey pumpkin, you look so sad.

481
00:37:43.763 --> 00:37:45.074
What's going on?

482
00:37:46.212 --> 00:37:48.108
You know what today is?

483
00:37:48.143 --> 00:37:51.281
It's take your kid to work day.

484
00:37:51.315 --> 00:37:52.797
But you know what?

485
00:37:52.832 --> 00:37:56.557
Instead of you following
Daddy around all day,


486
00:37:56.591 --> 00:37:59.763
I need you to sit
tight and wait.


487
00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:02.694
Now, give me your hand.

488
00:38:02.728 --> 00:38:03.625
- What? No.

489
00:38:03.659 --> 00:38:04.832
- I said give me your hand.

490
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:19.832
- You're gonna be.

491
00:39:28.763 --> 00:39:30.521
- What'd you do?

492
00:39:30.556 --> 00:39:33.281
- I'm starting to
get the hang of this.


493
00:39:38.039 --> 00:39:39.521
â™ª Here's my rebuttal

494
00:39:39.556 --> 00:39:42.901
â™ª It's my time,
my time, my time


495
00:39:42.936 --> 00:39:47.246
â™ª Don't hate the
player, hate the game


496
00:39:47.281 --> 00:39:52.074
â™ª Don't hate the
player, hate the game


497
00:39:52.108 --> 00:39:56.728
â™ª Don't hate the
player, hate the game


498
00:39:56.763 --> 00:40:01.487
â™ª Don't hate the
player, hate the game


499
00:40:01.521 --> 00:40:03.419
â™ª Hear a lot of music

500
00:40:03.453 --> 00:40:06.212
â™ª Even in my dreams

501
00:40:06.246 --> 00:40:10.936
â™ª Sweet funky music
with a melody


502
00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:12.763
â™ª Straight from my heart

503
00:40:12.797 --> 00:40:15.694
â™ª I'm here today

504
00:40:15.728 --> 00:40:19.281
â™ª To display my music
in a funky way


505
00:40:19.315 --> 00:40:20.452
â™ª Everybody sing on

506
00:40:20.487 --> 00:40:25.039
â™ª Don't hate the
player, hate the game


507
00:40:25.074 --> 00:40:29.763
â™ª Don't hate the
player, hate the game


508
00:40:29.797 --> 00:40:34.521
â™ª Don't hate the
player, hate the game


509
00:40:34.556 --> 00:40:39.108
â™ª Don't hate the
player, hate the game


510
00:41:00.074 --> 00:41:01.281
- What the hell?

511
00:41:04.039 --> 00:41:06.625
Alright, come on.

512
00:41:06.659 --> 00:41:10.212
Let me see you.

513
00:41:10.246 --> 00:41:12.108
Goddamn, bro.

514
00:41:12.143 --> 00:41:14.418
Don't you know how to
make an appointment, man?


515
00:41:14.452 --> 00:41:15.867
- Two, you're all booked up.

516
00:41:17.452 --> 00:41:18.384
Better check your fridge.

517
00:41:18.418 --> 00:41:20.384
You're almost outta beer.

518
00:41:20.418 --> 00:41:22.867
- What the hell you doin'
in my refrigerator, anyway?


519
00:41:22.901 --> 00:41:23.900
- I got's thirsty.

520
00:41:28.074 --> 00:41:28.970
- Then drink.

521
00:41:29.005 --> 00:41:31.039
- It's like I was sayin' fellas.

522
00:41:31.074 --> 00:41:33.867
You know, I hired you guys
to track somebody down.


523
00:41:33.901 --> 00:41:36.970
Turns out, I know
exactly where he is.


524
00:41:37.005 --> 00:41:38.015
- Where's the guy?

525
00:41:38.039 --> 00:41:40.763
- It's Jackson Bolt, cop killer.

526
00:41:46.867 --> 00:41:48.556
- We got a job to do.

527
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.694
The address is 357 Gibbs Lane.

528
00:41:51.728 --> 00:41:53.315
We'll see ya there.

529
00:42:08.177 --> 00:42:11.074
- Okay, we've done this before.

530
00:42:11.108 --> 00:42:12.257
Just trying to get
something done.


531
00:42:12.281 --> 00:42:13.797
Sure you can handle
it this time?


532
00:42:16.177 --> 00:42:18.383
Alright, so I'll tell
ya what I'm gonna do.


533
00:42:18.418 --> 00:42:20.556
Just for the record,
I'm gonna record


534
00:42:20.590 --> 00:42:22.659
this conversation, alright?

535
00:42:25.728 --> 00:42:27.418
Okay, so what I
want you to do now


536
00:42:27.452 --> 00:42:29.315
is just try to relax, alright?

537
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:30.487
Just lay down.

538
00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:33.487
Let your mind wander, see if we

539
00:42:33.521 --> 00:42:35.074
can get something done, alright?

540
00:42:41.521 --> 00:42:47.212
So, try to remember all these
things that happened to you.


541
00:42:47.246 --> 00:42:47.763
Take me back there.

542
00:42:47.797 --> 00:42:49.108
Make me,

543
00:42:49.143 --> 00:42:50.177
make me remember them.

544
00:42:50.212 --> 00:42:51.418
Let me see them.

545
00:42:51.452 --> 00:42:52.797
Tell me.

546
00:42:56.694 --> 00:42:58.521
- Man, why do we
have to do this?


547
00:42:58.556 --> 00:43:00.039
- Just relax.

548
00:43:00.074 --> 00:43:02.039
Take a deep breath, alright?

549
00:43:02.074 --> 00:43:02.867
One more time.

550
00:43:02.901 --> 00:43:04.418
Tell me what you see.

551
00:43:04.452 --> 00:43:06.143
Tell me what you hear.

552
00:43:06.177 --> 00:43:07.349
Tell me what you smell.

553
00:43:12.832 --> 00:43:13.694
bringing back all
the things you went through,


554
00:43:13.728 --> 00:43:15.143
All the things that happened.

555
00:43:16.212 --> 00:43:18.936
Just, if you relax, will come.

556
00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:20.005
Don't fight me.

557
00:43:20.039 --> 00:43:21.038
Just relax.

558
00:43:24.108 --> 00:43:25.107
Talk to me.

559
00:43:37.763 --> 00:43:40.625
We go through this all the time.

560
00:43:40.659 --> 00:43:42.108
Tell me something.

561
00:43:42.143 --> 00:43:45.349
Tell me what you hear, what
you see, what you smell.


562
00:43:51.763 --> 00:43:52.901
- I see a guy.

563
00:43:55.245 --> 00:43:56.244
Maybe two.

564
00:44:01.694 --> 00:44:02.487
I'm sorry, Tommy.

565
00:44:02.521 --> 00:44:03.520
I can't do this.

566
00:44:05.728 --> 00:44:08.556
- Stop being a goddamn
pussy, alright?


567
00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:09.901
Talk to me.

568
00:44:09.936 --> 00:44:11.143
Tell me what you see.

569
00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:13.797
What you hear, come on.

570
00:44:18.556 --> 00:44:19.556
- Two guys.

571
00:44:22.556 --> 00:44:23.728
I think it smells...

572
00:44:33.797 --> 00:44:35.108
Two guys are hittin' me.

573
00:44:40.005 --> 00:44:41.694
- Come on, talk
to me, talk to me.


574
00:44:42.936 --> 00:44:44.521
- Man, can I
just go get a beer?

575
00:44:47.625 --> 00:44:48.763
- Yeah.

576
00:44:48.797 --> 00:44:49.763
This one you're gonna
have to pay for.


577
00:44:49.797 --> 00:44:50.796
Get out.

578
00:45:03.143 --> 00:45:05.797
- We're gonna take him upstairs.

579
00:45:15.763 --> 00:45:16.762
Upstairs.

580
00:45:29.005 --> 00:45:30.694
- Tommy told
me to go upstairs.


581
00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:32.349
He knew something wasn't right.

582
00:45:45.867 --> 00:45:46.867
I see a guy.

583
00:45:47.797 --> 00:45:49.211
Okay, I see two guys.

584
00:45:49.245 --> 00:45:50.244
Two guys.

585
00:45:52.245 --> 00:45:55.487
What are they doing?

586
00:46:00.625 --> 00:46:01.694
- What?

587
00:46:28.245 --> 00:46:30.039
- What's up with
the gun, baby girl?


588
00:46:30.074 --> 00:46:31.073
- Fuck you.

589
00:46:33.487 --> 00:46:34.486
Old man.

590
00:46:35.487 --> 00:46:36.486
- Whoa.

591
00:46:49.176 --> 00:46:50.176
That's easy to say.

592
00:46:50.211 --> 00:46:51.659
You got your gun in your hand.

593
00:46:51.694 --> 00:46:53.176
I got my piece over there.

594
00:46:53.211 --> 00:46:54.590
I mean, it's easy to do.

595
00:46:54.625 --> 00:46:56.118
Let me put this, for a
second, let me put this here.


596
00:46:56.142 --> 00:46:57.141
Can you hold this?

597
00:47:48.763 --> 00:47:50.118
- Still
think I'm a pussy?


598
00:47:50.142 --> 00:47:51.141
- Comme ci, comme Ã§a.

599
00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:01.383
- Jackson, I love you.

600
00:48:02.728 --> 00:48:03.727
I love you.

601
00:48:07.936 --> 00:48:09.970
- My grumpy little baby.

602
00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.314
Mama's got a surprise.

603
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:14.867
- 'Swhatever.

604
00:48:14.901 --> 00:48:16.325
I'm not used to having my
plans fall apart like this.


605
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:19.107
- Just 'cause you never done
anything like this before baby.


606
00:48:21.211 --> 00:48:22.383
- You gonna be alright?

607
00:48:22.418 --> 00:48:24.314
- Now will you
listen to my idea?


608
00:48:25.797 --> 00:48:26.694
- I don't know.

609
00:48:26.728 --> 00:48:27.867
I just can't find Jackson.

610
00:48:27.901 --> 00:48:28.901
I can't--

611
00:48:28.936 --> 00:48:30.728
- Shh, shh, shh.

612
00:48:30.763 --> 00:48:31.946
There's only so many
places he could go


613
00:48:31.969 --> 00:48:33.763
to have that thing removed.

614
00:48:33.797 --> 00:48:35.521
I'm already on it.

615
00:48:35.556 --> 00:48:36.487
- There was something in my head

616
00:48:36.521 --> 00:48:38.142
that had to come out.

617
00:48:38.176 --> 00:48:40.901
I just remember waking
up in the hospital.


618
00:48:40.936 --> 00:48:41.969
Did they get it out?

619
00:48:42.969 --> 00:48:44.280
- Seriously, Bolt?

620
00:48:44.314 --> 00:48:45.313
Pizza?

621
00:48:46.314 --> 00:48:48.383
You are on a clear liquid diet.

622
00:48:49.521 --> 00:48:50.520
That's your dinner.

623
00:48:55.383 --> 00:48:56.176
- Hell yeah, they got it.

624
00:48:56.211 --> 00:48:57.418
It's right here, man.

625
00:48:59.797 --> 00:49:01.142
Who knows I'm here?

626
00:49:01.176 --> 00:49:02.735
- Man, I checked you
in with a fake I.D.


627
00:49:02.763 --> 00:49:03.694
Only me and Darla.

628
00:49:03.728 --> 00:49:07.004
- Darla?

629
00:49:07.038 --> 00:49:08.566
Man, she's gonna want to
have to come up here and--


630
00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:10.038
- No, man, no.

631
00:49:10.073 --> 00:49:11.394
Now, calm down, she's good,
I told her all about it.


632
00:49:11.418 --> 00:49:12.418
Everything's fine.

633
00:49:14.487 --> 00:49:15.867
- What about the blonde?

634
00:49:15.901 --> 00:49:18.280
- That would
be Bonnie Cardoza.


635
00:49:18.314 --> 00:49:19.969
Yeah, she works at Genotech.

636
00:49:20.004 --> 00:49:22.004
She's friends with
your boy, Danny.


637
00:49:22.038 --> 00:49:23.901
I think he paid off
her gambling debts


638
00:49:23.935 --> 00:49:24.934
and in return,

639
00:49:26.073 --> 00:49:28.969
she got him this
mind control device.


640
00:49:30.418 --> 00:49:32.487
I'm sure they have bigger
plans than just you.


641
00:49:32.521 --> 00:49:33.520
- Wow.

642
00:49:34.556 --> 00:49:36.280
What'd you do with her?

643
00:49:36.314 --> 00:49:38.038
- You mean like
unnatural acts?


644
00:49:38.073 --> 00:49:40.797
- No, no, asshole.

645
00:49:40.832 --> 00:49:42.418
Where is she?

646
00:49:42.452 --> 00:49:43.211
- She's fine.

647
00:49:43.245 --> 00:49:44.383
She's safe.

648
00:49:44.418 --> 00:49:46.107
We did just that
homework like you asked.


649
00:49:46.142 --> 00:49:47.141
- Good.

650
00:49:47.867 --> 00:49:50.038
Good, did you bring my bag?

651
00:49:50.073 --> 00:49:51.072
- Duh.

652
00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:53.589
It's right here.

653
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:55.867
- Get me my thing out my bag.

654
00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.497
- You get up outta that
bed and I'll give you


655
00:49:57.521 --> 00:49:58.694
that thing in your bag.

656
00:50:01.452 --> 00:50:02.670
- I'm gonna kick your ass, man.

657
00:50:02.694 --> 00:50:04.176
- That's what you keep sayin'.

658
00:50:07.142 --> 00:50:09.349
Look a little
wobbly there, Chief.


659
00:50:14.935 --> 00:50:17.004
I think you're looking
for this, right here.


660
00:50:23.314 --> 00:50:24.313
You ready?

661
00:50:36.418 --> 00:50:38.521
- I'm looking for someone.

662
00:50:39.763 --> 00:50:40.762
Jackson.

663
00:50:41.625 --> 00:50:42.624
Jackson Bolt.

664
00:50:45.452 --> 00:50:46.487
- Sorry, sir.

665
00:50:50.245 --> 00:50:51.244
- Wrong answer.

666
00:51:06.521 --> 00:51:08.004
- Bolt.

667
00:51:10.211 --> 00:51:12.625
- Man, you almost got
us fuckin' killed.


668
00:51:13.694 --> 00:51:14.969
- I like his suit.

669
00:51:15.004 --> 00:51:16.590
- Hey, it will fit you, I think.

670
00:51:19.418 --> 00:51:21.176
- Freeze, get on
the fucking ground!


671
00:51:49.418 --> 00:51:50.417
- Bolt!

672
00:52:00.211 --> 00:52:01.452
- I'm good, man, I'm good.

673
00:52:01.487 --> 00:52:03.073
It went straight through.

674
00:52:03.107 --> 00:52:04.796
Take this, get 'em man.

675
00:52:04.831 --> 00:52:06.383
I got your back.

676
00:52:06.418 --> 00:52:08.866
Go get 'em, go get 'em.

677
00:52:11.796 --> 00:52:13.383
- Number One, check in.

678
00:52:13.418 --> 00:52:14.900
- Number One, checking in.

679
00:52:14.935 --> 00:52:15.934
We got cops, sir.

680
00:52:17.176 --> 00:52:18.349
Too many cops.

681
00:52:18.383 --> 00:52:19.807
I think we gotta
get outta here, man.


682
00:52:19.831 --> 00:52:21.452
- I don't pay you to think.

683
00:52:21.487 --> 00:52:23.418
I pay you to do your job.

684
00:52:23.452 --> 00:52:25.590
Now, if you leave this
building without securing


685
00:52:25.625 --> 00:52:29.142
the package, I will hunt you
down and kill you personally.


686
00:52:29.176 --> 00:52:30.349
Do you understand?

687
00:52:31.487 --> 00:52:32.969
- Roger that, sir.

688
00:52:43.314 --> 00:52:44.313
- I don't have a gun.

689
00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:46.625
- Number Three.

690
00:52:46.659 --> 00:52:48.590
Do you have the backpack?

691
00:52:48.625 --> 00:52:50.831
- 'Course I got the
fucking backpack.


692
00:52:55.452 --> 00:52:59.796
Fuck.

693
00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:05.727
- Mr. Roundtree.

694
00:53:05.762 --> 00:53:07.142
We need another specimen.

695
00:53:08.107 --> 00:53:09.118
- I just peed.

696
00:53:09.142 --> 00:53:10.211
- Well, drink some water.

697
00:53:10.245 --> 00:53:11.211
We need it.

698
00:53:11.245 --> 00:53:12.831
Ring the bell when you're done.

699
00:53:16.452 --> 00:53:17.831
- I gotta get outta here.

700
00:53:20.969 --> 00:53:22.349
Time for a mixed drink.

701
00:53:38.073 --> 00:53:39.072
Freedom.

702
00:53:57.452 --> 00:53:59.727
This bitch just got peed on.

703
00:54:15.624 --> 00:54:16.727
- Yeah, yeah.

704
00:55:58.969 --> 00:56:00.118
- Okay, ladies,
let's get this liver in.


705
00:56:00.142 --> 00:56:01.280
I've got a date tonight.

706
00:56:02.866 --> 00:56:04.073
- Thank God.

707
00:56:04.107 --> 00:56:04.935
- There's
always an option.


708
00:56:04.969 --> 00:56:06.038
Hey!

709
00:56:06.073 --> 00:56:07.314
- Shh.

710
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.969
- What are
you doing in here?


711
00:56:08.004 --> 00:56:08.935
- Shh, shh, shh.

712
00:56:08.969 --> 00:56:09.727
- Excuse me, sir.

713
00:56:09.762 --> 00:56:10.245
Sir, can't you see--

714
00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:11.279
- Shh.

715
00:56:17.038 --> 00:56:17.935
- Gentlemen.

716
00:56:17.969 --> 00:56:19.073
- Shut up.

717
00:56:19.107 --> 00:56:19.900
- Gentlemen.

718
00:56:19.935 --> 00:56:20.727
This is an O.R.

719
00:56:20.762 --> 00:56:22.383
- I said shut up!

720
00:57:20.107 --> 00:57:21.106
- Sorry, man.

721
00:57:22.935 --> 00:57:24.900
It's the way it's gotta be.

722
00:57:31.727 --> 00:57:33.703
- In case you
were missing Jimmy and Sky,


723
00:57:33.727 --> 00:57:35.349
here they are, right
on time just to do


724
00:57:35.383 --> 00:57:36.935
a little dirty work for Danny.

725
00:57:36.969 --> 00:57:40.314
- So, what you're saying
is, this is a two-man job?


726
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:42.417
- Like I said a
hundred times, yes.


727
00:57:42.451 --> 00:57:43.693
Of course it is.

728
00:57:43.727 --> 00:57:45.796
- What I mean is,
I can't fuck up


729
00:57:45.831 --> 00:57:47.142
or you lose your paycheck.

730
00:57:56.796 --> 00:57:58.969
Don't make me fall
in love with you.


731
00:57:59.004 --> 00:58:00.796
- Jimmy, you're not getting me.

732
00:58:00.831 --> 00:58:03.727
- I'm getting
you alright, Sky,


733
00:58:03.762 --> 00:58:05.969
but what I don't want is for you

734
00:58:06.004 --> 00:58:09.796
to get kinda goofy all of a
sudden and change the plans


735
00:58:09.831 --> 00:58:12.727
because I might
accidentally grab this gun


736
00:58:12.762 --> 00:58:16.935
and spray your gray matter all
over the concrete out there.


737
00:58:16.969 --> 00:58:18.693
Do you want that?

738
00:58:18.727 --> 00:58:22.969
Your 100% commitment
to me is more important


739
00:58:23.004 --> 00:58:24.349
than this little gig here.

740
00:58:24.382 --> 00:58:27.831
Now, let's get out
there and do it.


741
00:58:38.176 --> 00:58:39.486
Mrs. Bolt?

742
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:40.969
- Yes.

743
00:58:41.004 --> 00:58:44.520
- Hi, I'm Officer DeSouza,
this is Officer Wright


744
00:58:44.555 --> 00:58:46.451
and we're here to
replace the gentlemen


745
00:58:46.486 --> 00:58:48.004
who have been watching you.

746
00:58:48.038 --> 00:58:49.969
- What happened to Greg?

747
00:58:50.004 --> 00:58:51.969
- He's dead to the world, tired.

748
00:58:52.004 --> 00:58:53.417
We had to let him go.

749
00:58:53.451 --> 00:58:55.049
- There is one thing
you could do for me.


750
00:58:55.073 --> 00:58:56.004
- Sure.

751
00:58:56.038 --> 00:58:56.969
- I need to go somewhere.

752
00:58:57.004 --> 00:58:58.382
- You know what?

753
00:58:58.417 --> 00:59:01.004
We have strict instructions
to take you nowhere


754
00:59:01.038 --> 00:59:03.107
unless you had to
go to the hospital.


755
00:59:03.142 --> 00:59:05.314
- Yes, I do.

756
00:59:05.348 --> 00:59:06.107
I need to go to the hospital.

757
00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:06.935
- Which one?

758
00:59:06.969 --> 00:59:08.004
- Mercy Hospital.

759
00:59:08.038 --> 00:59:09.142
- Let's get crackin'.

760
00:59:09.176 --> 00:59:10.107
Come on.

761
00:59:10.142 --> 00:59:12.520
- Great, I'll just get my bag.

762
00:59:16.624 --> 00:59:18.107
- After you.

763
00:59:22.211 --> 00:59:24.176
- Thank you so much for this.

764
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.073
- So sorry about this.

765
00:59:36.245 --> 00:59:37.382
You know what?

766
00:59:37.417 --> 00:59:38.969
Seems much worse than it is, but

767
00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:41.073
now that we're together,

768
00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:46.762
I think you and I
can make things work.


769
00:59:46.796 --> 00:59:47.969
We're both victims here.

770
00:59:48.866 --> 00:59:51.038
- I'm nothing like you.

771
00:59:51.073 --> 00:59:53.107
- Yes, you are.

772
00:59:53.142 --> 00:59:58.107
You know, you're a lady,
and I understand that.


773
00:59:59.382 --> 01:00:02.935
But right now, you're my lady,

774
01:00:04.211 --> 01:00:07.211
and when we get through
this little ordeal,


775
01:00:07.245 --> 01:00:11.589
I think maybe we
can both escape.


776
01:00:11.624 --> 01:00:13.831
- Don't be stupid.

777
01:00:13.866 --> 01:00:15.762
He'll kill us both
and you know it.


778
01:00:16.727 --> 01:00:17.520
- You know what?

779
01:00:17.555 --> 01:00:18.796
I don't think so.

780
01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:20.831
I'm extremely valuable to him.

781
01:00:20.866 --> 01:00:21.831
- Pfft.

782
01:00:21.866 --> 01:00:24.004
- He's got a lot
of plans for me,


783
01:00:24.038 --> 01:00:25.037
and you know what?

784
01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:27.520
I've got a few plans for you.

785
01:00:28.762 --> 01:00:33.244
But, do this right, this
doesn't have to go down


786
01:00:33.279 --> 01:00:36.038
your throat 'cause I'd
hate to see what would


787
01:00:36.073 --> 01:00:39.211
happen to those
beautiful.


788
01:00:40.486 --> 01:00:43.969
So, what do you say
we work together?


789
01:00:44.004 --> 01:00:44.796
Okay?

790
01:00:44.831 --> 01:00:45.900
- Fuck you.

791
01:00:45.935 --> 01:00:47.142
- Okay.

792
01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:47.969
That's a great idea.

793
01:00:48.004 --> 01:00:50.313
- Don't touch me.

794
01:00:50.348 --> 01:00:52.176
- Please, dear.

795
01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:55.900
You don't understand
me at all, do you?


796
01:00:55.935 --> 01:00:57.279
- Keep away from me.

797
01:00:59.313 --> 01:01:04.451
- How could I keep away from
something so precious like you?


798
01:01:04.486 --> 01:01:05.796
Please understand.

799
01:01:10.796 --> 01:01:13.451
My, this is
always how it starts.


800
01:01:15.417 --> 01:01:16.520
I think this is yours.

801
01:01:33.693 --> 01:01:35.004
I think she doesn't like me.

802
01:01:35.038 --> 01:01:36.969
- Zip it up.

803
01:01:37.004 --> 01:01:39.004
One day that dick's
gonna get you killed.


804
01:01:41.555 --> 01:01:42.554
- Idea.

805
01:01:43.796 --> 01:01:44.795
Threesome.

806
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:48.589
- Fuck you.

807
01:01:48.624 --> 01:01:49.623
Partner.

808
01:01:58.658 --> 01:02:00.831
- Your man is an asshole.

809
01:02:00.866 --> 01:02:02.313
- He's not my man.

810
01:02:03.555 --> 01:02:07.175
So, maybe you can help
me get away from him.


811
01:02:08.555 --> 01:02:09.796
- You got a gun.

812
01:02:09.831 --> 01:02:10.624
- This?

813
01:02:10.658 --> 01:02:12.038
It's not even loaded.

814
01:02:12.073 --> 01:02:13.072
He took my clip.

815
01:02:30.141 --> 01:02:31.348
- Comfortable?

816
01:02:31.382 --> 01:02:32.624
Is that better?

817
01:02:32.658 --> 01:02:34.220
'Cause that borrowed
suit you was wearing,


818
01:02:34.244 --> 01:02:35.693
it was a little snug.

819
01:02:35.727 --> 01:02:36.945
Kinda worried about ya,
thought you were gonna


820
01:02:36.969 --> 01:02:39.210
start singing soprano in
the Vienna Boys' Choir.


821
01:02:42.073 --> 01:02:43.072
Tough name.

822
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:46.175
Anyway, it's like they say man.

823
01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:48.969
All's fair in love
and war and us,


824
01:02:49.004 --> 01:02:50.866
we're almost the
end of the line.


825
01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.141
- End of the line?

826
01:02:52.175 --> 01:02:54.727
Danny, what are
you talking about?


827
01:02:54.762 --> 01:02:58.106
- Mother fucker,
chess, I told you.


828
01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:01.106
I'm about to castle my rook
and I know you wanna knock


829
01:03:01.141 --> 01:03:03.693
all the pieces off the
board, make a big mess,


830
01:03:03.727 --> 01:03:05.520
but this game's still in effect.

831
01:03:06.727 --> 01:03:07.935
- What game?

832
01:03:07.969 --> 01:03:09.287
Danny, what are
you talking about?


833
01:03:09.693 --> 01:03:10.451
- Ha, not now, my friend.

834
01:03:10.486 --> 01:03:12.073
I think we have guests.

835
01:03:12.106 --> 01:03:13.141
Ruby?

836
01:03:21.038 --> 01:03:22.762
You're gonna love this.

837
01:03:22.796 --> 01:03:23.658
Check it out.

838
01:03:23.693 --> 01:03:25.555
Look what I did for you.

839
01:03:30.693 --> 01:03:32.703
Ladies and gentlemen, I know
you have a lot of questions.


840
01:03:32.727 --> 01:03:34.244
Let's get started.

841
01:03:34.279 --> 01:03:36.049
- What are your plans for a
sports themed fashion line?


842
01:03:36.072 --> 01:03:38.969
- Hey, hey, hey, this
is a Danny original.


843
01:03:39.004 --> 01:03:40.048
This man looks good, don't he?

844
01:03:40.072 --> 01:03:42.175
- When was your last fight?

845
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:43.866
- It's been awhile,
it's been awhile,


846
01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:45.382
but it'll be alright.

847
01:03:45.417 --> 01:03:46.348
- Is there any truth to
the rumor that this fight


848
01:03:46.382 --> 01:03:48.004
isn't properly sanctioned?

849
01:03:48.038 --> 01:03:49.935
- We have all of our paperwork.

850
01:03:49.969 --> 01:03:52.417
I'll have my secretary get
it to you in the morning.


851
01:03:53.693 --> 01:03:54.589
- Danny, I heard
you were indicted


852
01:03:54.624 --> 01:03:55.520
for illegal sports activity.

853
01:03:55.555 --> 01:03:56.727
Can you explain?

854
01:03:58.658 --> 01:03:59.589
- It's all conjecture.

855
01:03:59.624 --> 01:04:01.072
Nothing's ever been proven.

856
01:04:01.106 --> 01:04:03.244
- I heard that you had
to fight four pit bulls


857
01:04:03.279 --> 01:04:04.358
just to prepare for this fight.

858
01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:05.210
Is that true?

859
01:04:05.244 --> 01:04:06.451
- Hey, hey, hey.

860
01:04:06.486 --> 01:04:08.072
No dogs were hurt
during the training.


861
01:04:08.106 --> 01:04:08.900
We're animal lovers.

862
01:04:08.935 --> 01:04:10.141
We are dog people.

863
01:04:10.175 --> 01:04:11.624
Love dogs.

864
01:04:11.658 --> 01:04:13.186
- Mr. Bolt, it's been 10
years since your last fight.


865
01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:15.175
Are you properly
trained for this?


866
01:04:15.210 --> 01:04:16.555
- This man is a machine.

867
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:17.935
This man is an
officer of the law.


868
01:04:17.969 --> 01:04:19.451
He is a policeman.

869
01:04:19.486 --> 01:04:21.831
Every day out there on those
streets, that's his training.


870
01:04:21.866 --> 01:04:23.313
He's gonna be ready.

871
01:04:23.348 --> 01:04:24.911
- Danny, is there any truth
to the rumor that you're


872
01:04:24.935 --> 01:04:27.831
connected to a prostitution
ring with a man named Jimmy?


873
01:04:27.866 --> 01:04:29.313
- Ha ha ha!

874
01:04:29.348 --> 01:04:30.969
This press conference is over.

875
01:04:31.003 --> 01:04:32.210
Ruby.

876
01:04:32.244 --> 01:04:33.417
- You heard him.

877
01:04:33.451 --> 01:04:35.037
Get the fuck out!

878
01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:37.105
- Cheers.

879
01:04:38.693 --> 01:04:40.382
Y'all have a good day.

880
01:04:40.417 --> 01:04:41.210
Thank you for coming out.

881
01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.243
Appreciate you.

882
01:04:58.210 --> 01:04:59.106
- Remember that guy

883
01:04:59.141 --> 01:05:00.255
who helped me pull the trigger?

884
01:05:00.279 --> 01:05:02.175
Yeah, that's Rusty Brown.

885
01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:05.279
Another two-bit wannabe
gangster that works for Danny.


886
01:05:05.313 --> 01:05:07.141
His prints were all over my gun.

887
01:05:07.175 --> 01:05:09.658
- I tell you I had nothing
to do with it, man.


888
01:05:14.900 --> 01:05:16.175
You don't have any weapon.

889
01:05:17.762 --> 01:05:19.762
- You need us to show
it to you, dummy?


890
01:05:19.796 --> 01:05:22.658
We found the gun used to kill
Detective West Rassmuesen.


891
01:05:24.072 --> 01:05:26.382
- It's got your
fingerprints all over it.


892
01:05:28.003 --> 01:05:29.072
- I been set up.

893
01:05:30.555 --> 01:05:34.451
- We got evidence tying you to
this and 10 other homicides.


894
01:05:34.486 --> 01:05:37.072
- You've got
five minutes to think


895
01:05:37.106 --> 01:05:40.417
about what you're gonna do.

896
01:05:40.451 --> 01:05:41.866
It's gonna change your life.

897
01:05:43.831 --> 01:05:44.831
- Not in a good way.

898
01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:49.555
He ain't no killer.

899
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:50.382
We should just let him go.

900
01:05:50.417 --> 01:05:51.934
- Yeah, bullshit.

901
01:05:51.968 --> 01:05:54.313
- Just open the door, we don't
got enough evidence, do we?


902
01:05:54.348 --> 01:05:56.141
- Yeah, like I said.

903
01:05:57.106 --> 01:05:58.693
- We're gonna be here all night.

904
01:06:01.831 --> 01:06:03.520
- Have you talked
to your wife today?


905
01:06:03.555 --> 01:06:04.831
Do you know where she is?

906
01:06:06.313 --> 01:06:07.600
- Do you want me to
throw the fight, Danny?


907
01:06:07.624 --> 01:06:08.762
Is that it?

908
01:06:08.796 --> 01:06:10.037
- Throw the fight?

909
01:06:10.072 --> 01:06:13.003
I want you to die in the ring.

910
01:06:13.037 --> 01:06:14.106
Make it look good.

911
01:06:14.141 --> 01:06:17.693
Nine, 10 rounds, but die.

912
01:06:17.727 --> 01:06:20.486
And that's gonna be
checkmate mother fucker.


913
01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.427
- How does a man
on the run wanted for killing


914
01:06:22.451 --> 01:06:24.175
his partner
boxing ring?


915
01:06:27.106 --> 01:06:30.175
Somehow, Danny took
care of everything.


916
01:06:44.555 --> 01:06:47.313
What about that
chick in my dreams?


917
01:06:47.348 --> 01:06:49.348
Turns out, she was an
expert at implanting


918
01:06:49.382 --> 01:06:51.175
mind control devices.

919
01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:53.417
She worked for
Danny, or that's what


920
01:06:53.451 --> 01:06:54.462
everyone thought at the time.

921
01:06:54.486 --> 01:06:55.658
- Get the fuck up.

922
01:06:57.658 --> 01:06:58.772
And you are gonna
tell me everything


923
01:06:58.796 --> 01:07:00.727
I fucking wanna know right now.

924
01:07:00.762 --> 01:07:02.279
- Please.

925
01:07:02.313 --> 01:07:03.899
- I wanna know where Darla is!

926
01:07:03.934 --> 01:07:05.313
- You don't understand.

927
01:07:05.348 --> 01:07:07.899
- I don't care.

928
01:07:07.934 --> 01:07:09.589
- He's going to kill me!

929
01:07:09.624 --> 01:07:12.037
- I need to know
where Darla is now!


930
01:07:25.934 --> 01:07:26.933
- Whoo!

931
01:08:03.762 --> 01:08:05.313
- Yeah! Yeah!

932
01:08:05.348 --> 01:08:07.037
- Whoo, whoo, whoo!

933
01:08:36.244 --> 01:08:37.486
- Jackson.

934
01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.838
What the fuck did
you get me into?


935
01:08:43.555 --> 01:08:44.968
- Red, are you there?

936
01:08:45.003 --> 01:08:46.899
Red, it's about dinnertime.

937
01:08:46.934 --> 01:08:49.624
- Yeah, one more perimeter
sweep, then I'll take it in.


938
01:09:20.037 --> 01:09:22.313
- They should stop the fight.

939
01:09:41.726 --> 01:09:43.451
- All I had
to do to save Darla


940
01:09:43.486 --> 01:09:45.968
was allow myself to
get beaten to death.


941
01:09:46.003 --> 01:09:48.865
I'd do anything for Darla,
even laid out my life,


942
01:09:48.899 --> 01:09:50.313
and Danny knew that.

943
01:09:50.348 --> 01:09:53.486
He bet his entire life savings
on these fights tonight.


944
01:10:01.244 --> 01:10:02.313
- He's gettin' up.

945
01:10:02.348 --> 01:10:04.037
I can't believe it!

946
01:10:42.968 --> 01:10:45.417
- Man, you guys really
need to learn how to shoot.


947
01:11:02.313 --> 01:11:03.830
- You think you're okay?

948
01:11:03.865 --> 01:11:06.417
- You do care about
me, don't you?


949
01:11:06.451 --> 01:11:09.003
- I just think we
make a great team.


950
01:11:09.037 --> 01:11:12.244
- Yeah, I think so too.

951
01:11:12.279 --> 01:11:15.761
- Were you serious
about going to Mexico?


952
01:11:15.795 --> 01:11:17.210
- Deadly serious.

953
01:11:18.486 --> 01:11:20.003
- So, we're really
leaving tonight?


954
01:11:20.037 --> 01:11:20.934
- We are.

955
01:11:20.968 --> 01:11:22.451
I've got the tickets right here.

956
01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:24.313
Midnight tonight.

957
01:11:25.588 --> 01:11:27.555
- Can you do me a favor, then?

958
01:11:27.588 --> 01:11:28.657
Please?

959
01:11:28.692 --> 01:11:29.691
- What is it?

960
01:11:30.761 --> 01:11:34.175
- Will you call your
brother and just ask him


961
01:11:34.210 --> 01:11:38.348
to leave my mom alone and
don't do anything to my baby?


962
01:11:38.382 --> 01:11:39.175
Just, just--

963
01:11:39.210 --> 01:11:40.037
- Come on.

964
01:11:40.072 --> 01:11:41.313
- Just for a few days.

965
01:11:41.348 --> 01:11:42.141
- Why? Why?

966
01:11:42.175 --> 01:11:43.037
- Please.

967
01:11:43.072 --> 01:11:43.899
- Why should I?

968
01:11:43.934 --> 01:11:44.933
- Please.

969
01:11:50.210 --> 01:11:51.520
- Bro.

970
01:11:51.554 --> 01:11:53.106
Yeah, it's me.

971
01:11:53.141 --> 01:11:54.175
You know what?

972
01:11:55.899 --> 01:11:58.623
I'm not gonna be calling
you for a few days.


973
01:11:58.657 --> 01:12:00.623
I'm gonna be gone
and when I get back


974
01:12:00.657 --> 01:12:02.657
that's when I'll call you,
so don't call me, okay?


975
01:12:02.692 --> 01:12:03.691
Goodbye.

976
01:12:13.244 --> 01:12:14.657
- Ha!

977
01:12:27.692 --> 01:12:28.691
- Are you okay?

978
01:12:32.486 --> 01:12:33.485
- I am now.

979
01:12:35.899 --> 01:12:37.106
Where's Darla?

980
01:12:37.141 --> 01:12:38.140
- There.

981
01:12:42.106 --> 01:12:45.417
- This is the fighter that
Jackson Bolt is waiting for.


982
01:12:45.451 --> 01:12:49.210
The only fighter to beat
Jackson, 10 years ago.


983
01:12:49.244 --> 01:12:50.726
Over to Sheila,
with the interview.


984
01:12:50.761 --> 01:12:51.692
- Thank you, Rick.

985
01:12:51.726 --> 01:12:53.003
Hi, I'm here with Abrafo.

986
01:12:53.037 --> 01:12:54.934
How are you feeling
about today's fight?


987
01:12:54.968 --> 01:12:57.003
- I ain't thinking about it.

988
01:12:57.037 --> 01:12:58.048
- Is there anything
new that we should


989
01:12:58.072 --> 01:12:59.313
be expecting from you today?

990
01:12:59.348 --> 01:13:00.979
I know you're a very
successful kickboxer,


991
01:13:01.003 --> 01:13:03.048
so, we're all anticipating to
see what you do in the ring.


992
01:13:03.072 --> 01:13:04.899
- I'm gonna do the
same shit I did to Bolt


993
01:13:04.934 --> 01:13:07.657
that I did last
time, whoop his ass.


994
01:13:11.588 --> 01:13:14.417
- Abrafo was the one
fighter I could never beat.


995
01:13:24.037 --> 01:13:26.003
I guess this is the end.

996
01:13:30.417 --> 01:13:31.761
- David, my God.

997
01:13:31.795 --> 01:13:32.692
Get these things off me.

998
01:13:32.726 --> 01:13:34.485
- I got you, I got you.

999
01:13:48.968 --> 01:13:49.967
I got you.

1000
01:13:53.037 --> 01:13:54.244
- Where's Jackson?

1001
01:13:58.382 --> 01:13:59.381
- Hello?

1002
01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:03.450
Jackson, it's for you.

1003
01:14:03.485 --> 01:14:04.484
- Jackson.

1004
01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:07.313
She's safe, I got her, man.

1005
01:14:08.865 --> 01:14:09.864
I got her.

1006
01:14:24.175 --> 01:14:27.588
- I don't know what
the heck's happening.


1007
01:14:43.382 --> 01:14:44.554
- I don't believe this.

1008
01:14:44.588 --> 01:14:46.037
He's gonna throw
him outta the ring!


1009
01:14:48.692 --> 01:14:51.450
- Danny lost
every cent he had that day.


1010
01:15:00.899 --> 01:15:04.210
All he had to do was open his
briefcase and press a button.


1011
01:15:28.244 --> 01:15:30.013
- Unless, of
course, someone thought


1012
01:15:30.037 --> 01:15:31.726
Danny was too much
of a liability.


1013
01:15:45.657 --> 01:15:46.588
â™ª I'm a statement

1014
01:15:46.623 --> 01:15:47.934
â™ª

1015
01:15:47.968 --> 01:15:49.313
â™ª No feelings at all

1016
01:15:49.347 --> 01:15:51.313
- Is that pineapple
pizza I can smell?


1017
01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:53.210
- Yeah, I was hungry.

1018
01:15:53.244 --> 01:15:54.761
- And you're not having this.

1019
01:15:57.692 --> 01:16:00.141
- You know you shouldn't
be eating that.


1020
01:16:00.175 --> 01:16:02.141
- I'm hungry, come on.

1021
01:16:02.175 --> 01:16:03.899
- Why can't I look after you?

1022
01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:05.692
David, hi.

1023
01:16:05.726 --> 01:16:07.245
The big guy was just
talking about you.


1024
01:16:07.279 --> 01:16:09.450
- Yeah, talking about
kicking my ass, right?


1025
01:16:09.485 --> 01:16:10.830
- That's what it was.

1026
01:16:10.865 --> 01:16:13.141
See, I thought he
said, "Kiss my ass."


1027
01:16:13.175 --> 01:16:14.485
- No, I know I'm right.

1028
01:16:14.519 --> 01:16:15.554
I'm sure of it.

1029
01:16:16.588 --> 01:16:17.934
- Sky, how are you?

1030
01:16:17.968 --> 01:16:19.381
- Marvelous.

1031
01:16:19.416 --> 01:16:22.381
Now that I met the most
beautiful man I've ever seen.


1032
01:16:23.623 --> 01:16:24.519
- Beautiful.

1033
01:16:24.554 --> 01:16:26.141
She calls this beautiful.

1034
01:16:27.278 --> 01:16:28.381
Whatever.

1035
01:16:29.623 --> 01:16:30.902
- Shall I give
you guys a minute?


1036
01:16:30.934 --> 01:16:33.450
- Nah, we just came in
to check on ya, buddy,


1037
01:16:33.485 --> 01:16:34.312
see how you're doing.

1038
01:16:34.347 --> 01:16:35.519
Want you to rest up.

1039
01:16:35.554 --> 01:16:36.668
We'll come back and
see ya tomorrow.


1040
01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:37.692
- Love you, partner.

1041
01:16:37.726 --> 01:16:38.899
- Love you too, brother.

1042
01:16:42.934 --> 01:16:44.657
- Thank you, Jackson.

1043
01:16:48.899 --> 01:16:49.968
- Get outta here.

1044
01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:51.899
- } Hello?

1045
01:16:51.934 --> 01:16:52.726
- Hello, Darla?

1046
01:16:52.761 --> 01:16:54.312
- Hi.

1047
01:16:54.347 --> 01:16:55.485
How is your day going?

1048
01:16:55.519 --> 01:16:56.934
- Nah, it's all going good.

1049
01:16:56.968 --> 01:16:57.865
It's all going good.

1050
01:16:57.899 --> 01:16:59.210
- Can he make an appointment?

1051
01:16:59.244 --> 01:17:00.726
- No, that's a good idea.

1052
01:17:00.761 --> 01:17:03.795
I think it would be nice if
both of you came in together.


1053
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:05.554
I'd love to see
both of you, okay?


1054
01:17:05.588 --> 01:17:07.003
- Thanks, Tommy.

1055
01:17:07.037 --> 01:17:08.623
- Alright, I look forward to it.

1056
01:17:08.657 --> 01:17:09.656
Bye.

1057
01:17:13.899 --> 01:17:15.037
- Tommy.

1058
01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:19.416
You know how I feel about him.

1059
01:17:19.450 --> 01:17:21.761
- I know, but you
need to see him.


1060
01:17:25.312 --> 01:17:26.554
- Go get me a pizza.

1061
01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:28.449
- Stop it.

1062
01:17:33.175 --> 01:17:34.072
- God.

1063
01:17:34.106 --> 01:17:36.347
- Get some rest, okay?

1064
01:17:36.381 --> 01:17:38.243
- Alright, love you.

1065
01:17:38.278 --> 01:17:39.278
- Love you, too.

1066
01:17:39.312 --> 01:17:40.312
- Get outta here.

1067
01:18:06.003 --> 01:18:07.554
â™ª I try to forget you

1068
01:18:07.588 --> 01:18:09.968
â™ª I try to escape

1069
01:18:10.003 --> 01:18:13.347
â™ª This feeling in my heart

1070
01:18:13.381 --> 01:18:14.934
â™ª Try to erase you

1071
01:18:14.968 --> 01:18:17.416
â™ª By running away

1072
01:18:17.450 --> 01:18:21.209
â™ª But your love has
left me scarred


1073
01:18:21.243 --> 01:18:25.003
â™ª Now I feel so lost inside

1074
01:18:25.037 --> 01:18:28.761
â™ª My whole world's gone empty

1075
01:18:28.795 --> 01:18:31.968
â™ª I just wanna feel alive

1076
01:18:32.003 --> 01:18:34.865
â™ª Alive

1077
01:18:34.899 --> 01:18:38.588
â™ª I climb the highest mountain

1078
01:18:38.623 --> 01:18:42.795
â™ª Swim the seven seas

1079
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:46.830
â™ª Do anything for a
second chance at love


1080
01:18:46.865 --> 01:18:49.347
â™ª That was meant for me

1081
01:18:49.381 --> 01:18:52.106
â™ª There's no other
way of saying


1082
01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:53.692
â™ª No other way to

1083
01:18:53.726 --> 01:18:57.003
â™ª Get around these feelings

1084
01:18:57.037 --> 01:18:59.140
â™ª You're the one

1085
01:18:59.174 --> 01:19:00.347
â™ª You're the one

1086
01:19:00.381 --> 01:19:05.072
â™ª Every day you
are my everything


1087
01:19:06.209 --> 01:19:09.761
â™ª I don't want
nobody else but you


1088
01:19:12.312 --> 01:19:17.278
â™ª And if loving
all I wanna do


1089
01:19:19.726 --> 01:19:22.554
â™ª And if you don't come back

1090
01:19:22.588 --> 01:19:27.278
â™ª My whole life is through

1091
01:19:27.312 --> 01:19:32.312
â™ª So I don't want
nobody else but you


1092
01:19:34.072 --> 01:19:39.037
â™ª Nobody else but you

1093
01:19:39.968 --> 01:19:41.312
â™ª Don't tell me it's over

1094
01:19:41.347 --> 01:19:43.761
â™ª It's never too late

1095
01:19:43.795 --> 01:19:47.003
â™ª If hope is all I have

1096
01:19:47.037 --> 01:19:48.726
â™ª Then I'll keep on wishing

1097
01:19:48.761 --> 01:19:51.072
â™ª I'll pray every day

1098
01:19:51.105 --> 01:19:55.209
â™ª For the love that I once had

1099
01:19:55.243 --> 01:19:58.485
â™ª 'Cause I feel so lost inside

1100
01:19:58.519 --> 01:20:02.381
â™ª My whole world's gone empty

1101
01:20:02.416 --> 01:20:07.416
â™ª I just wanna feel alive

1102
01:20:08.726 --> 01:20:12.381
â™ª I'll climb the
highest mountain


1103
01:20:12.416 --> 01:20:15.968
â™ª Sail the seven seas

1104
01:20:16.003 --> 01:20:20.588
â™ª Do anything for a
second chance at love


1105
01:20:20.623 --> 01:20:22.968
â™ª That was meant for me

1106
01:20:23.003 --> 01:20:25.865
â™ª There's no other
way of saying


1107
01:20:25.899 --> 01:20:27.140
â™ª No other way to

1108
01:20:27.174 --> 01:20:31.036
â™ª Get around these feelings

1109
01:20:31.071 --> 01:20:32.761
â™ª You're the one

1110
01:20:32.795 --> 01:20:35.036
â™ª You're the one every day

1111
01:20:35.071 --> 01:20:39.174
â™ª You're my everything

1112
01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:44.140
â™ª I don't want
nobody else but you


1113
01:20:46.071 --> 01:20:51.003
â™ª And if loving

1114
01:20:53.519 --> 01:20:55.795
â™ª And if you don't come

1115
01:20:55.830 --> 01:21:00.726
â™ª I realize it's through

1116
01:21:01.865 --> 01:21:06.105
â™ª So I don't want
nobody else but you


1117
01:21:07.519 --> 01:21:12.554
â™ª Nobody else but you

1118
01:21:16.036 --> 01:21:19.347
â™ª Nobody else, nobody else

1119
01:21:19.381 --> 01:21:23.209
â™ª No

1120
01:21:23.243 --> 01:21:26.657
â™ª There's nobody
else, nobody else


1121
01:21:26.692 --> 01:21:30.657
â™ª Nobody else but you

1122
01:21:30.692 --> 01:21:32.554
â™ª There's nobody else

1123
01:21:32.588 --> 01:21:34.105
â™ª Nobody else

1124
01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:38.209
â™ª Nobody else but you

1125
01:21:38.243 --> 01:21:41.519
â™ª There's nobody
else, nobody else


1126
01:21:41.554 --> 01:21:46.174
â™ª Nobody else but you

1127
01:21:46.209 --> 01:21:48.967
â™ª Nobody else, nobody else

1128
01:21:49.002 --> 01:21:52.105
â™ª Nobody else but you
