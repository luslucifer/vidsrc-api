3
00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:26.226
- So what you're telling me
Syfal,


4
00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:28.395
is that you haven't seen or
heard anything


5
00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:30.647
out of the ordinary lately?

6
00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:34.943
- (heavy breathing) Cayla
please,
I'm telling you the truth.


7
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:38.863
I have not seen

8
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:41.825
anything.

9
00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:45.286
- And you are certain
you haven't seen anybody


10
00:01:45.286 --> 00:01:47.330
who may of looked odd uh?

11
00:01:48.164 --> 00:01:53.169
- No, no I haven't seen
anything out of the ordinary.


12
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:55.380
Cayla please!

13
00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:59.050
I don't want to die!

14
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.886
- Sil has seen this man in his
visions,


15
00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:04.556
so I know he's somewhere near.

16
00:02:04.556 --> 00:02:06.933
And you were given a simple task

17
00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:10.729
of keeping your eye open
and nose to the ground.


18
00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.400
- I'm telling you the truth.
(footsteps crunching)


19
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.985
I haven't heard anything.

20
00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.030
- And I understand information

21
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.699
can be elusive at times, I get
that.


22
00:02:23.783 --> 00:02:27.245
But what I don't get is
why you would do business


23
00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:30.081
with the resistance,
those underground shits


24
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:33.752
who think that they can
overthrow Sil, your new Lord!


25
00:02:33.752 --> 00:02:35.253
- Wait Cayla, please!

26
00:02:35.253 --> 00:02:36.921
(heavy breathing)
(Cayla laughs)


27
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:39.758
- You think we wouldn't find
out?


28
00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:41.926
- (groaning) Please!

29
00:02:45.597 --> 00:02:49.350
Cayla please, I was trying
to get information for you.


30
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.478
- Shut up you lying shit!

31
00:02:51.478 --> 00:02:53.897
(Syfal screams)
- I never liked you Syfal.


32
00:02:53.897 --> 00:02:56.900
I would of slit your
throat a long time ago


33
00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.487
but Sil found your influence
useful.


34
00:03:00.487 --> 00:03:03.323
All you were to do was
to keep an eye on things


35
00:03:03.323 --> 00:03:06.910
and report back and in return
your family stays safe.


36
00:03:07.994 --> 00:03:09.746
But what do you do?

37
00:03:09.746 --> 00:03:12.749
Go and mingle with a
bunch of has been soldiers


38
00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:14.793
who think that they can
overthrow a God!


39
00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:15.960
Are you mad?

40
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.920
(thudding)

41
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.589
- Commander, he claims
to have seen two people


42
00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:21.091
running from the forest.

43
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.644
- So child, tell me what you
saw.


44
00:03:32.644 --> 00:03:34.312
- I was chasing down a weasel
for food


45
00:03:34.312 --> 00:03:37.190
when I saw two people run from
the forest.


46
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.817
- Did they run past you?

47
00:03:38.817 --> 00:03:41.027
- No, I was about 100 feet
behind a tree


48
00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:42.153
when I noticed them.

49
00:03:42.153 --> 00:03:46.116
- You said they ran out
of a forest, which forest?


50
00:03:46.116 --> 00:03:48.159
- The Forest of SiKoran.

51
00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.285
(heavy drum beat)

52
00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:51.621
- Are you sure it was SiKoran?

53
00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:52.455
- Yes

54
00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:56.501
- What did they look like?

55
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.462
- They were too far for me to
see,


56
00:03:59.462 --> 00:04:02.340
but one had on a black
jacket with a hood and he was


57
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.883
pulling someone else behind him.

58
00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:04.884
- Pulling?
- Yes!


59
00:04:04.884 --> 00:04:06.511
They were running pretty fast.

60
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:08.721
- Why were they being chased?

61
00:04:08.721 --> 00:04:10.849
- I don't know, I didn't
see anyone behind them.


62
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.059
(forboding music)

63
00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:14.435
- You shit!

64
00:04:14.435 --> 00:04:15.478
All this time you knew!

65
00:04:15.478 --> 00:04:16.813
(sword whooshing)
- No, no.


66
00:04:16.813 --> 00:04:18.356
(splattering)

67
00:04:18.356 --> 00:04:21.526
(footsteps crunching)

68
00:04:24.237 --> 00:04:27.073
- (sighs) Get up!

69
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:32.453
(sword scraping)
Is that all you saw?


70
00:04:32.453 --> 00:04:33.538
- Yes Ms. Korvesian.

71
00:04:40.378 --> 00:04:44.257
- If you're lying to me
about any of this boy,


72
00:04:44.257 --> 00:04:47.051
I'll gut you and feed you to my
dogs.


73
00:04:47.927 --> 00:04:49.053
Do you understand?

74
00:04:49.053 --> 00:04:50.555
- Ye, Yes Ms. Korvesian.

75
00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:53.558
- Good, what's your name?

76
00:04:53.558 --> 00:04:54.475
- Orin.

77
00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:58.271
- Orin, you will take over
Syfal's role.


78
00:04:58.271 --> 00:05:02.108
Find information on any
nearby resistance groups


79
00:05:02.108 --> 00:05:04.652
and what roles Syfal played in
them.


80
00:05:04.652 --> 00:05:07.989
You have two weeks to report
back to me.


81
00:05:07.989 --> 00:05:09.199
Is that clear?

82
00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.201
- Yes, yes thank you Ms.
Kovesian.


83
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:12.368
I won't let you down.

84
00:05:12.368 --> 00:05:15.580
- Of course, your life depends
on it.


85
00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:19.083
Go, begin!

86
00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:22.587
(footsteps crunching)

87
00:05:22.587 --> 00:05:24.589
- LyGon
-Ril
-Cylus
-CorRegin!

88
00:05:24.589 --> 00:05:25.798
(clashing)

89
00:05:25.798 --> 00:05:30.803
(electric zapping)
(grunting)


90
00:05:33.932 --> 00:05:34.766
- Ah.

91
00:05:37.018 --> 00:05:38.144
Hmm.

92
00:05:38.144 --> 00:05:40.897
(dramatic chord)

93
00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:46.778
(blade whooshing)
(squelching)


94
00:05:46.778 --> 00:05:48.279
- Ah!
(thuds)


95
00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.323
- All of you, listen up!

96
00:05:50.323 --> 00:05:54.410
I am Cayla Korvesian,
commander of Sil's army.


97
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:57.789
And you are now under the
rule of the new republic,


98
00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:59.624
Sil's republic!

99
00:05:59.624 --> 00:06:02.210
Your days of freedom are over!

100
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.463
We decide what you can and
cannot have!


101
00:06:05.463 --> 00:06:09.133
We decide what you can and
cannot do!


102
00:06:09.133 --> 00:06:11.928
Your fate lies with us!

103
00:06:11.928 --> 00:06:13.554
Do you understand?

104
00:06:13.554 --> 00:06:14.555
- [All] Yes.

105
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:20.645
- I can see in your eyes you
want me dead.


106
00:06:21.896 --> 00:06:26.234
Well I want you dead too
but my king has plans.


107
00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:32.740
If any of you decide to
run off, I will personally


108
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.744
hunt you down and hang your
body parts from the trees.


109
00:06:36.744 --> 00:06:39.122
Do you understand?

110
00:06:39.122 --> 00:06:40.081
- [All] Yes.

111
00:06:40.081 --> 00:06:42.458
We own you!

112
00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:47.213
(footsteps)

113
00:06:47.213 --> 00:06:49.841
(upbeat music)

114
00:06:55.555 --> 00:06:58.224
(door clicking)

115
00:07:07.984 --> 00:07:09.277
- What?

116
00:07:09.277 --> 00:07:13.948
Monica, damn, can somebody
have a moment of peace?


117
00:07:13.948 --> 00:07:16.534
- What are you doing in a
bar this early in the morning


118
00:07:16.534 --> 00:07:18.119
during working hours?

119
00:07:18.119 --> 00:07:19.787
- For your information,
the owner let me in here


120
00:07:19.787 --> 00:07:22.457
and technically it's not open.

121
00:07:22.457 --> 00:07:24.709
Anyways, how the hell did you
find me?


122
00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:26.377
- That's what I do!

123
00:07:26.377 --> 00:07:28.254
Anyway, where is your little
friend Eric?


124
00:07:28.254 --> 00:07:30.340
- I don't know, you're his boss

125
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.382
shouldn't you know?

126
00:07:35.428 --> 00:07:37.472
and all I got was his
corny little voicemails.


127
00:07:37.472 --> 00:07:41.059
- Well there you go, maybe
he got lucky and overslept.


128
00:07:41.059 --> 00:07:42.727
He did catch a nice one last
night.


129
00:07:42.727 --> 00:07:43.978
- Pff!

130
00:07:43.978 --> 00:07:46.481
- What, you jealous?

131
00:07:46.481 --> 00:07:49.525
- Ah no, it's just disgusting
how you guys


132
00:07:49.525 --> 00:07:51.069
see us as catches.

133
00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:54.739
- Yes we see them as catches.

134
00:07:54.739 --> 00:07:56.324
I didn't say anything about you.

135
00:07:57.241 --> 00:07:58.659
- Oh shut up!

136
00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:01.371
If you hear from him,
tell him to see me pronto,


137
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:03.247
if he doesn't want to get
written up.


138
00:08:03.247 --> 00:08:05.083
Oh and also, Mills has some more
reports


139
00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:06.542
he needs him to do.

140
00:08:06.542 --> 00:08:07.418
- More work?

141
00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:10.922
He's already swamped with the
work you gave him yesterday.


142
00:08:10.922 --> 00:08:13.216
- Yeah well not much I can do.

143
00:08:13.216 --> 00:08:14.467
Mills is trying to save his ass

144
00:08:14.467 --> 00:08:15.593
by getting these reports ready

145
00:08:15.593 --> 00:08:17.136
for his presentation next month.

146
00:08:17.136 --> 00:08:19.472
- At Eric's expense?

147
00:08:19.472 --> 00:08:20.640
Unbelievable!

148
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.850
- Like I said, not much I can
do.


149
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:26.604
- Whatever, if you're done,
can I get back to work please?


150
00:08:26.604 --> 00:08:28.481
You're killing my vibe girl.

151
00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:29.982
- Vibe?

152
00:08:29.982 --> 00:08:31.734
You're not even suppose
to be listening to music


153
00:08:31.734 --> 00:08:34.112
on the job anyway, let alone in
a bar


154
00:08:34.112 --> 00:08:35.780
during working hours.

155
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:38.241
- Shoo, go so I can get my work
done.


156
00:08:38.241 --> 00:08:39.742
- Shoo?

157
00:08:39.742 --> 00:08:41.160
You don't shoo me.

158
00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.453
You think you can just wave your
hand


159
00:08:42.453 --> 00:08:44.705
and I'll go running away 'cause
you wanna listen to music


160
00:08:44.705 --> 00:08:46.124
and act like you're doing work?

161
00:08:46.124 --> 00:08:47.458
In a bar?

162
00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:49.961
(laughs) Who do you think you
are?


163
00:08:49.961 --> 00:08:50.795
Prince?

164
00:08:52.296 --> 00:08:54.966
- Monica, you know I still
have that photo of you


165
00:08:54.966 --> 00:08:56.592
back in your experimental
college days.


166
00:08:56.592 --> 00:09:01.139
- Oh, don't you dare Jimmy,
you better give me that photo.


167
00:09:01.139 --> 00:09:02.723
- Then you let me get back to
work


168
00:09:02.723 --> 00:09:05.017
and you leave Eric alone.

169
00:09:05.017 --> 00:09:06.894
- Fine, whatever!

170
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.021
But I'm still watching you.

171
00:09:09.021 --> 00:09:09.856
- Ew!

172
00:09:11.023 --> 00:09:11.983
- F
-U Jimmy!

173
00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.323
- Ooh, whoever she is Eric,
I hope she's worth it.


174
00:09:19.323 --> 00:09:21.909
(upbeat music)

175
00:09:23.161 --> 00:09:26.164
(footsteps tapping)

176
00:09:27.415 --> 00:09:29.750
(door clicking)

177
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.835
(electric zapping)

178
00:09:30.835 --> 00:09:32.545
- Must you keep throwing me
around?


179
00:09:34.297 --> 00:09:37.049
- What is, what is this, what is
this?


180
00:09:37.049 --> 00:09:40.219
- Good, the king's coming
through.


181
00:09:40.219 --> 00:09:43.222
(footsteps tapping)

182
00:09:47.185 --> 00:09:48.519
- What were those things

183
00:09:48.519 --> 00:09:51.147
that attacked me in the forest,
huh?


184
00:09:51.147 --> 00:09:53.816
Sofia, is that even your real
name?


185
00:09:53.816 --> 00:09:55.985
What is going on?

186
00:09:55.985 --> 00:09:59.030
(footsteps tapping)

187
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:00.490
- Things that attacked you in
the forest


188
00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:02.325
are called The Children,

189
00:10:02.325 --> 00:10:04.952
mastered by an evil sorceress
named Sidra.


190
00:10:04.952 --> 00:10:07.371
Eric, I'll explain more later.

191
00:10:08.289 --> 00:10:10.875
I just need you to be quiet and
be still.


192
00:10:12.043 --> 00:10:14.754
(bottle clinking)
Here, have a drink!


193
00:10:14.754 --> 00:10:17.757
(footsteps tapping)

194
00:10:28.768 --> 00:10:29.727
- Sofia I...

195
00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:34.607
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't
realize you were changing.


196
00:10:36.651 --> 00:10:39.403
- Eric please, haven't
seen a woman before?


197
00:10:39.403 --> 00:10:42.240
- Well yeah of course, I
didn't want you to think--


198
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:44.742
- Alright, alright, stay where
you are


199
00:10:44.742 --> 00:10:47.078
if it makes you feel better.

200
00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:59.048
(fabric crinkling)

201
00:10:59.048 --> 00:11:01.551
(zipper zips)

202
00:11:05.429 --> 00:11:08.349
(footsteps tapping)

203
00:11:08.349 --> 00:11:09.475
- Wow, um.

204
00:11:13.312 --> 00:11:15.106
- Let me properly introduce
myself.


205
00:11:15.106 --> 00:11:19.652
My name is Sofia Hayden, army
commander of The City of Merc,


206
00:11:19.652 --> 00:11:21.946
your city Sire, and my duty

207
00:11:21.946 --> 00:11:23.739
is to help you get your memory
back.


208
00:11:24.657 --> 00:11:28.578
- My memory back, my memory is
just fine.


209
00:11:28.578 --> 00:11:31.455
I clearly remember you
slapping me on stage.


210
00:11:31.455 --> 00:11:33.541
- That I did, but I'm here

211
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:35.793
to help you remember your true
self.


212
00:11:35.793 --> 00:11:37.128
- What?
- Please, sit down.


213
00:11:37.128 --> 00:11:38.129
Let me explain.

214
00:11:39.463 --> 00:11:41.340
- Uh, uh, oh on the floor?

215
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.342
- Yes Eric, on the floor.

216
00:11:58.149 --> 00:11:59.734
- How do you feel?

217
00:11:59.734 --> 00:12:03.029
- Well, I mean, I mean, how,
how am I supposed to feel?


218
00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:05.448
Okay, I am trapped in a theater
with you


219
00:12:05.448 --> 00:12:07.116
and all I want
to do is go home.

220
00:12:07.116 --> 00:12:09.952
- Do you feel any comfort at
all?


221
00:12:09.952 --> 00:12:10.786
- No!

222
00:12:12.496 --> 00:12:13.831
- Are you feeling stronger?

223
00:12:13.831 --> 00:12:15.499
- No Sofia I don't!

224
00:12:17.501 --> 00:12:19.295
- Okay, let me explain.

225
00:12:20.463 --> 00:12:23.382
You are on a planet
named Ressear, our Mother


226
00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:27.011
and you are not really Eric
Wilson.


227
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:30.848
You are the reincarnation of
a King named Zhayian Crehin.


228
00:12:31.682 --> 00:12:36.187
Lord of Merc, master of
the Nebtonian art form.


229
00:12:36.187 --> 00:12:40.024
You ruled over the Eastern
sector 2000 years ago.


230
00:12:40.024 --> 00:12:42.985
- Wait, wait, hold on.

231
00:12:42.985 --> 00:12:46.072
So your saying that this is not
Earth


232
00:12:46.072 --> 00:12:48.824
but a planet called Rosser.

233
00:12:49.825 --> 00:12:51.535
- It's pronounced Ressear.

234
00:12:53.663 --> 00:12:55.873
- Okay, alright, yes, so if
that's true,


235
00:12:55.873 --> 00:12:57.208
how did I get here?

236
00:12:57.208 --> 00:12:59.293
Do you own a spaceship or
something?


237
00:12:59.293 --> 00:13:01.212
- No, I bridged you over.

238
00:13:01.212 --> 00:13:06.217
- Bridged me over, you mean
like beam me up Scotty?


239
00:13:06.217 --> 00:13:09.553
- Something like that, just more
organic.


240
00:13:10.388 --> 00:13:11.389
- Okay, yeah.

241
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:15.226
- Don't mock me Eric, this is
not a joke!


242
00:13:15.226 --> 00:13:17.228
A great soldier and good
friend gave his life


243
00:13:17.228 --> 00:13:19.814
creating this bridge to find
you!


244
00:13:19.814 --> 00:13:21.482
- I'm sorry, I am sorry.

245
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.860
- His name was Akinnis, remember
that!


246
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.323
He was the only one that
believed in prophecy.


247
00:13:29.323 --> 00:13:30.741
He believed in you.

248
00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:33.202
- Alright alright.

249
00:13:33.202 --> 00:13:34.662
- We have a new threat.

250
00:13:34.662 --> 00:13:38.207
(fire flickering)
A gifted warlock named Yahzeel


251
00:13:38.207 --> 00:13:40.209
who's taking over most of
Ressear.


252
00:13:40.209 --> 00:13:41.043
(screeching)

253
00:13:45.256 --> 00:13:49.260
Combine forces and take over
both Ressear


254
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.553
and your planet, Earth.

255
00:13:51.762 --> 00:13:53.764
- Why does he need Yahzeel?

256
00:13:53.764 --> 00:13:55.766
- Because he can't do it
himself.


257
00:13:55.766 --> 00:13:56.809
(whooshing)

258
00:14:01.647 --> 00:14:03.858
Only Yahzeel
(background screeching)


259
00:14:03.858 --> 00:14:06.777
has the power and intellect to
do so.


260
00:14:06.777 --> 00:14:10.281
- And so you think that
I can help with this?


261
00:14:10.281 --> 00:14:12.199
- Of course, you're Lord Crehin.

262
00:14:13.492 --> 00:14:15.411
But you can't do it yourself.

263
00:14:15.411 --> 00:14:16.746
You need to find the other three

264
00:14:16.746 --> 00:14:18.956
and assemble the Royal Four.

265
00:14:18.956 --> 00:14:20.249
- The Royal Four?

266
00:14:20.249 --> 00:14:23.544
- Yes, that is how the
citizens began to call you


267
00:14:23.544 --> 00:14:25.671
after you defeated Yahzeel.

268
00:14:25.671 --> 00:14:29.425
- Look Sofia, look, lo,
I am no hero king, okay,


269
00:14:29.425 --> 00:14:32.136
and this world that you
live in doesn't even


270
00:14:32.136 --> 00:14:35.306
sound like a place that I
wanna be a part of, okay?


271
00:14:35.306 --> 00:14:38.350
I am just Eric Wilson an
analyst, alright?


272
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:40.352
And thanks to you, I--
- Okay.


273
00:14:42.146 --> 00:14:46.233
I'll take you back, but let
me do this one first, okay?


274
00:14:50.571 --> 00:14:52.281
- This is the Stone of Essence.

275
00:14:53.866 --> 00:14:55.701
After you guys defeated Yahzeel,

276
00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:58.162
you had the four of you insert a
part


277
00:14:58.162 --> 00:15:00.831
of your essence into this stone.

278
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:01.665
- Why?

279
00:15:03.751 --> 00:15:05.669
- To help find you in your new
bodies,


280
00:15:05.669 --> 00:15:08.631
in case a great evil
threatens our Mother again.


281
00:15:10.007 --> 00:15:11.467
And only someone strong

282
00:15:11.467 --> 00:15:14.845
and pure of heart would
be able to command it.


283
00:15:14.845 --> 00:15:18.390
- So I'm guessing you're the
strong and pure of heart.


284
00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:19.892
- So far.

285
00:15:19.892 --> 00:15:22.770
- To be sure that you're Lord
Crehin,


286
00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.480
I need to see if your blood
flows


287
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.606
with our Mothers energy.

288
00:15:25.606 --> 00:15:28.192
- Wha, wait, hold on, so you
plan on


289
00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:29.735
cutting me open or something?

290
00:15:29.735 --> 00:15:32.154
- No, I just need you to stay
seated


291
00:15:33.155 --> 00:15:34.824
and if this doesn't work,

292
00:15:34.824 --> 00:15:38.077
I promise, I will take
you back myself, okay?


293
00:15:38.994 --> 00:15:40.538
(clicks tongue)

294
00:15:40.538 --> 00:15:41.789
(sighs)

295
00:15:41.789 --> 00:15:45.376
- Alright, fine, let's get this
over with.


296
00:15:45.376 --> 00:15:47.461
- Keep your palms closed.

297
00:15:55.719 --> 00:16:00.724
(Sofia softly chants)
(ominous music)


298
00:16:05.771 --> 00:16:09.233
(loud whooshing)

299
00:16:09.233 --> 00:16:10.234
(grinding)

300
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:22.413
Ooh! (groaning) stop
please, please stop, stop!


301
00:16:36.594 --> 00:16:39.430
(heavy breathing)

302
00:16:41.015 --> 00:16:44.101
(gentle music)

303
00:16:44.101 --> 00:16:44.935
- No, no.

304
00:16:49.398 --> 00:16:50.983
But the stone glowed.

305
00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.113
Maybe I was in the right area

306
00:16:56.113 --> 00:16:57.406
but I had the wrong guy.

307
00:16:59.533 --> 00:17:00.367
So why?

308
00:17:00.367 --> 00:17:03.245
(heavy breathing)

309
00:17:03.245 --> 00:17:04.079
All I have to do

310
00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:05.289
is take him back
(digital zapping)


311
00:17:05.289 --> 00:17:07.458
and look for a more robust man.

312
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.045
Yeah.

313
00:17:12.922 --> 00:17:14.298
(electric zapping)

314
00:17:14.298 --> 00:17:16.175
- Gom BY Ronen Boa!

315
00:17:16.175 --> 00:17:17.468
(loud bang)

316
00:17:17.468 --> 00:17:20.304
(heavy thud)
- Ah!


317
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.476
(heavy breathing)

318
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.230
- Go Ron Bi Corr Vel Oa!

319
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.399
(loud bang)

320
00:17:32.399 --> 00:17:33.943
Where's my wife?

321
00:17:33.943 --> 00:17:35.736
Where is my son?

322
00:17:35.736 --> 00:17:37.237
Speak maggot!

323
00:17:37.237 --> 00:17:38.072
- I brought you back

324
00:17:40.574 --> 00:17:41.575
Speak!

325
00:17:41.575 --> 00:17:43.994
- Our Mother is in great danger.

326
00:17:43.994 --> 00:17:46.497
We need you to help
assemble the Royal Four!


327
00:17:46.497 --> 00:17:48.082
- What do you know of us?

328
00:17:48.082 --> 00:17:50.000
- I know you are heroes.

329
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.836
You saved our Mother from
Yahzeel


330
00:17:52.836 --> 00:17:55.297
and you created the Stone
of Essence to find you.


331
00:17:55.297 --> 00:17:57.675
- Only the strong and pure of
heart


332
00:17:57.675 --> 00:18:00.636
can find the Stone of
Essence and wheel its power.


333
00:18:00.636 --> 00:18:01.512
Is this you?

334
00:18:01.512 --> 00:18:02.930
- Yes sire.

335
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.932
- Then show me my stone.

336
00:18:08.435 --> 00:18:11.480
- Here is the Stone of Essence.

337
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.817
(dramatic music)

338
00:18:14.817 --> 00:18:19.822
- (exhales sharply) It's
been a long time my friend.


339
00:18:21.407 --> 00:18:24.076
I can still feel us all in here.

340
00:18:25.327 --> 00:18:26.662
Let's find our comrades.

341
00:18:28.205 --> 00:18:29.665
- Sire?

342
00:18:29.665 --> 00:18:32.042
- Who are you and what is your
title?


343
00:18:32.042 --> 00:18:35.879
- I'm Sofia Hayden, army
commander of your kingdom Merc.


344
00:18:35.879 --> 00:18:38.215
- Army commander?
- Yes sire.


345
00:18:39.383 --> 00:18:40.759
- What day and age is this?

346
00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:42.052
- 21st century sire.

347
00:18:43.887 --> 00:18:44.722
- Interesting.

348
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.768
If you are who you say you are,
show me your soldiers mark.


349
00:18:56.608 --> 00:18:59.028
- Army commander, good to meet
you.


350
00:19:00.195 --> 00:19:02.448
Now who's this creature
that threatens our Mother?


351
00:19:02.448 --> 00:19:04.033
- His name is Sil.

352
00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:07.369
He's taken over many
lands and plans on finding


353
00:19:07.369 --> 00:19:10.539
and resurrect Yahzeel.
- (loud crunching) Yahzeel!


354
00:19:10.539 --> 00:19:12.249
What does he know about Yahzeel?

355
00:19:12.249 --> 00:19:13.584
- I believe he wants to use him

356
00:19:13.584 --> 00:19:16.253
to take over--
- Yahzeel cannot be used.


357
00:19:16.253 --> 00:19:18.255
He cannot be reasoned with.

358
00:19:18.255 --> 00:19:20.924
That's why we buried
his corpse so far down.


359
00:19:20.924 --> 00:19:21.925
There nobody--
(loud bang)


360
00:19:21.925 --> 00:19:24.928
(voices whispering)

361
00:19:24.928 --> 00:19:25.763
Ooh!

362
00:19:27.514 --> 00:19:29.975
Who are these people in my head?

363
00:19:29.975 --> 00:19:32.770
(loud whooshing)

364
00:19:34.855 --> 00:19:36.440
Get out of my head!

365
00:19:37.357 --> 00:19:42.029
(screaming)
(whooshing)


366
00:19:42.905 --> 00:19:44.615
(loud banging)

367
00:19:44.615 --> 00:19:45.449
Ah!

368
00:19:47.367 --> 00:19:48.619
By Loe Bor, Ah!

369
00:19:50.871 --> 00:19:52.206
(loud whooshing)

370
00:19:52.206 --> 00:19:53.290
- Sofia!

371
00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:55.876
(groaning)

372
00:19:55.876 --> 00:19:57.086
What are you doing?

373
00:19:57.086 --> 00:19:58.629
(loud bang)

374
00:19:58.629 --> 00:19:59.463
- Gah!

375
00:20:02.424 --> 00:20:05.135
(loud whooshing)

376
00:20:11.225 --> 00:20:12.810
- Sire, sire, sire?

377
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.397
Sire, sire.

378
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.235
Hm.

379
00:20:23.112 --> 00:20:24.613
Welcome home sire.

380
00:20:26.949 --> 00:20:29.701
(birds tweeting)

381
00:20:30.994 --> 00:20:34.164
(footsteps crunching)

382
00:20:41.547 --> 00:20:44.383
(heavy breathing)

383
00:20:58.522 --> 00:21:01.441
(foreboding music)

384
00:21:15.998 --> 00:21:17.332
- They're close.

385
00:21:20.836 --> 00:21:23.505
(low growling)

386
00:21:23.505 --> 00:21:26.008
(tense music)

387
00:21:29.386 --> 00:21:31.638
(growling)

388
00:21:55.412 --> 00:22:00.417
(suspenseful music)
(creature growling)


389
00:22:19.603 --> 00:22:22.314
(dramatic music)

390
00:23:58.493 --> 00:23:59.703
- You were one of us?

391
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.042
Oh my god.

392
00:24:05.042 --> 00:24:06.626
What has Sil done to you?

393
00:24:06.626 --> 00:24:07.461
To us?

394
00:24:08.837 --> 00:24:10.047
If I had known brother...

395
00:24:15.385 --> 00:24:16.970
Rest,

396
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:19.139
and may Mother find you a
peaceful vessel.


397
00:24:19.139 --> 00:24:21.892
(dramatic music)

398
00:24:28.106 --> 00:24:32.652
(hisses)
(dramatic music)


399
00:24:32.652 --> 00:24:37.657
(growling)
(bones cracking)


400
00:24:39.618 --> 00:24:42.412
- [Soldier] Lord, are you
alright?


401
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.083
(dramatic music)

402
00:24:52.297 --> 00:24:54.591
- Commander, it's Lord Sil.

403
00:24:56.885 --> 00:24:59.012
- Yes, my love.
- Where are you?


404
00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.432
- I just leaving Syfal.
- Good.


405
00:25:02.432 --> 00:25:05.602
Meet me at the northern end
of SiKoran by the bridge.


406
00:25:05.602 --> 00:25:08.021
- SiKoran, why in--
- Cayla, just be there!


407
00:25:09.106 --> 00:25:10.190
- What is it?

408
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.442
- He wants us to meet him in
SiKoran.


409
00:25:13.318 --> 00:25:15.821
- SiKoran, why?
- I don't know,


410
00:25:15.821 --> 00:25:18.949
but if he insists, it must be
important.


411
00:25:20.409 --> 00:25:23.078
(phone ringing)

412
00:25:24.287 --> 00:25:27.207
- Ahh, Vowlan, I haven't heard
from you in quite some time.


413
00:25:27.207 --> 00:25:28.959
You better have good news for
me.


414
00:25:28.959 --> 00:25:32.087
- [Vowlan] Yes, my lord,
we have got Yahzeel.


415
00:25:32.087 --> 00:25:33.588
- Are you sure it's Yahzeel?

416
00:25:33.588 --> 00:25:34.965
- [Vowlan] It is him.

417
00:25:34.965 --> 00:25:36.967
- Are you positive?

418
00:25:36.967 --> 00:25:38.468
- [Vowlan] Yes, I am very
positive.


419
00:25:38.468 --> 00:25:41.054
- Good work Vowlan, very good.

420
00:25:42.472 --> 00:25:43.974
Make sure to secure the area.

421
00:25:44.808 --> 00:25:46.059
- [Vowlan] But there was a
problem.


422
00:25:46.059 --> 00:25:47.811
SiKoran has woken.

423
00:25:47.811 --> 00:25:48.770
- What?

424
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.147
- [Vowlan] He's killing
everyone.


425
00:25:50.147 --> 00:25:51.440
- I'll take care of it.

426
00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.025
You just make sure nothing
comes near that site.


427
00:25:54.025 --> 00:25:55.277
You understand!

428
00:25:55.277 --> 00:25:57.028
- [Vowlan] Yes, I do.

429
00:25:58.655 --> 00:26:01.408
(dramatic music)

430
00:26:18.675 --> 00:26:21.511
- Where did you learn
to fight like that, boy?


431
00:26:22.721 --> 00:26:24.389
- Fight like what?

432
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:26.683
I was just trying to defend
myself.


433
00:26:26.683 --> 00:26:29.269
- Don't lie to me.

434
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:31.980
Where did you learn to fight
like that?


435
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.356
Who trained you?

436
00:26:34.232 --> 00:26:36.526
What is your species?

437
00:26:36.526 --> 00:26:38.695
- I, I'm just a villager, I
swear.


438
00:26:38.695 --> 00:26:40.071
That goon was trying to kill me,
okay.


439
00:26:40.071 --> 00:26:43.241
I just did what came natural.
- Exactly!


440
00:26:43.241 --> 00:26:48.205
Common villagers don't
fight like that, unless


441
00:26:48.371 --> 00:26:50.165
they're some type of spy.

442
00:26:51.166 --> 00:26:52.709
Are you this,

443
00:26:52.709 --> 00:26:54.336
a spy,

444
00:26:54.336 --> 00:26:55.879
villager?

445
00:26:55.879 --> 00:26:58.715
Are you some sort of resistance
groupie


446
00:26:58.715 --> 00:27:01.885
hoping to bring back the good
old days?


447
00:27:01.885 --> 00:27:04.554
(laughs)

448
00:27:04.554 --> 00:27:05.597
Maybe I should open you up

449
00:27:05.597 --> 00:27:08.266
and spill your hope all over the
ground.


450
00:27:08.266 --> 00:27:09.809
- Please, Miss, I'm not a spy
for the--


451
00:27:09.809 --> 00:27:12.979
- It's Lieutenant Kryst to you,
boy.


452
00:27:14.856 --> 00:27:16.775
- I'm sorry Lieutenant.

453
00:27:17.984 --> 00:27:20.028
But I'm not a spy for the
resistance.


454
00:27:21.196 --> 00:27:23.240
I'm a spy for the New Republic.

455
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.199
- Really?

456
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.077
How so?

457
00:27:27.077 --> 00:27:29.246
- Commander Korvesian
tasked with a mission.


458
00:27:30.497 --> 00:27:32.415
I'm supposed to locate any
nearby resistance groups


459
00:27:32.415 --> 00:27:34.084
and report back to her.

460
00:27:34.084 --> 00:27:36.586
- Commander Cayla Korvesian

461
00:27:36.586 --> 00:27:38.880
task you with a mission?

462
00:27:39.756 --> 00:27:41.091
- Yes.

463
00:27:41.091 --> 00:27:42.300
I'm supposed to infiltrate their
ranks


464
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.927
and find out what my town leader
knew


465
00:27:43.927 --> 00:27:45.095
and report back to her.

466
00:27:47.597 --> 00:27:50.183
- What sector are you from?

467
00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:53.395
- The western sector.

468
00:27:55.146 --> 00:27:57.023
- That's Syfal's area.

469
00:27:57.983 --> 00:28:00.777
How you plan to do this
without him knowing?


470
00:28:04.072 --> 00:28:04.906
- He's dead.

471
00:28:06.408 --> 00:28:07.242
Cayla killed him.

472
00:28:08.994 --> 00:28:11.079
- That would make it easier.

473
00:28:12.747 --> 00:28:15.292
Does the Commander know
about your fighting skill?


474
00:28:16.293 --> 00:28:17.752
- No, I don't have one.

475
00:28:17.752 --> 00:28:20.088
Look, I've seen your
soldiers fight before.


476
00:28:20.088 --> 00:28:22.591
I just tried a few moves and got
lucky.


477
00:28:22.591 --> 00:28:26.970
- Moves like that are not built
with luck.


478
00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:29.848
You'll come with us and I'll
find out who you really are.


479
00:28:31.057 --> 00:28:32.350
- Please, Lieutenant, please

480
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.144
I have to complete this mission,

481
00:28:34.144 --> 00:28:36.438
otherwise my village is
gonna be slaughtered.


482
00:28:36.438 --> 00:28:39.357
- That is not my concern.

483
00:28:40.442 --> 00:28:41.651
Guard.

484
00:28:41.651 --> 00:28:46.656
(dramatic music)
(phone keys beeping)


485
00:28:46.656 --> 00:28:48.283
- [Quilinresh] This is
Supreme World Alliance.


486
00:28:48.283 --> 00:28:49.868
- Hello Quilinresh,

487
00:28:49.868 --> 00:28:51.578
I'm needing to schedule
an emergency meeting


488
00:28:51.578 --> 00:28:53.455
with the committee tonight.

489
00:28:53.455 --> 00:28:54.998
- [Quilinresh] Ooh, it's
kind of last minute.


490
00:28:54.998 --> 00:28:55.832
I don't know if I can--

491
00:28:55.832 --> 00:28:57.083
- I'm sure you can gather them.

492
00:28:57.083 --> 00:28:58.418
- [Quilinresh] Well, you
know tomorrow is the event--


493
00:28:58.418 --> 00:29:00.629
- Yes, yes, I know Kyten is-
- Good,


494
00:29:00.629 --> 00:29:02.213
so they don't really want any
disturbance during this time.


495
00:29:02.213 --> 00:29:04.174
- Cut me off again, Quilinresh,

496
00:29:04.174 --> 00:29:07.385
and I will send Cayla to visit
your family tonight instead.


497
00:29:08.553 --> 00:29:09.888
- [Quilinresh] What about 9:00
p.m.?


498
00:29:09.888 --> 00:29:12.349
- Yes, 9:00 p.m. will be
perfect.


499
00:29:12.349 --> 00:29:13.183
- [Quilinresh] Good.

500
00:29:13.183 --> 00:29:14.184
- We'll be dining in the Red
Chamber.


501
00:29:14.184 --> 00:29:15.935
- [Quilinresh] Then I'll
go and contact them.


502
00:29:15.935 --> 00:29:17.604
- Good, see you there.

503
00:29:24.319 --> 00:29:27.322
- Lieutenant, please listen to
me.


504
00:29:27.322 --> 00:29:28.448
If I was to come with you,

505
00:29:28.448 --> 00:29:29.908
and Commander Korvesian finds
out


506
00:29:29.908 --> 00:29:31.159
that you interfered with a
mission


507
00:29:31.159 --> 00:29:32.369
directly instructed by her,

508
00:29:32.369 --> 00:29:34.371
how is that gonna look on you?

509
00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.040
You really want to take that
chance?


510
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.542
She's known as The Daughter of
Demons.


511
00:29:40.543 --> 00:29:42.337
Do you really wanna gamble with
her?


512
00:29:45.382 --> 00:29:46.716
- Guard,

513
00:29:46.716 --> 00:29:48.259
call headquarters.

514
00:29:48.259 --> 00:29:49.761
Confirm the story.

515
00:29:58.144 --> 00:30:01.314
- Lieutenant, they do not
know anything about this.


516
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:03.274
- Of course they wouldn't.

517
00:30:03.274 --> 00:30:04.734
I just came from her an hour
ago.


518
00:30:07.153 --> 00:30:08.238
- Call the Commander!

519
00:30:09.072 --> 00:30:10.448
- Directly?

520
00:30:10.448 --> 00:30:11.533
We're normally not allowed to--

521
00:30:11.533 --> 00:30:13.535
- Shut up and just do it!

522
00:30:17.914 --> 00:30:20.583
(phone ringing)

523
00:30:21.668 --> 00:30:23.086
- No one's answering.

524
00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.758
- It's your call, Lieutenant.

525
00:30:28.758 --> 00:30:30.427
- I know it's my call!

526
00:30:30.427 --> 00:30:32.137
Just shut up and let me think!

527
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.934
Fuck!

528
00:30:39.018 --> 00:30:40.145
Okay,

529
00:30:40.145 --> 00:30:41.521
spy!

530
00:30:41.521 --> 00:30:44.315
Go ahead and complete your task.

531
00:30:45.275 --> 00:30:48.319
But if I find out you're lying
to me...


532
00:30:52.949 --> 00:30:57.203
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Don't thank me.


533
00:30:57.203 --> 00:31:00.248
You just better be right for
your sake.


534
00:31:07.922 --> 00:31:09.632
Keep a tag on him.

535
00:31:09.632 --> 00:31:12.427
As soon as he reaches the
resistance,


536
00:31:12.427 --> 00:31:14.637
send me his coordinates.

537
00:31:17.348 --> 00:31:20.310
It's time for things
to change around here.


538
00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:23.062
(dramatic music)

539
00:31:56.721 --> 00:31:57.680
- [Guard] Lord Sil.

540
00:32:01.726 --> 00:32:03.353
[Both] My love.

541
00:32:03.353 --> 00:32:06.147
- My beautiful demons, tell
me, what have you learned?


542
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:08.107
- Not much,

543
00:32:10.735 --> 00:32:13.738
out of this forest by
someone in a black cloak.


544
00:32:14.823 --> 00:32:15.657
- Who saw him?

545
00:32:17.283 --> 00:32:20.787
- A young boy from Syfal's
village named Orin.


546
00:32:20.787 --> 00:32:22.205
- Was Syfal aware of this?

547
00:32:22.205 --> 00:32:24.707
- [Cayla] He was, but he lied
about it.


548
00:32:24.707 --> 00:32:26.376
- [Sil] Where is he now?

549
00:32:26.376 --> 00:32:29.879
- Still in the barn with a
severed head.


550
00:32:29.879 --> 00:32:31.047
- Good.

551
00:32:31.047 --> 00:32:32.590
Anything on the Resistance?

552
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.343
- No, but I gave that young Orin
a task


553
00:32:35.343 --> 00:32:36.553
to find out what he can

554
00:32:36.553 --> 00:32:39.097
and report back to me in two
weeks.


555
00:32:39.097 --> 00:32:41.224
- [Sil] Are you so sure
you can trust this kid?


556
00:32:41.224 --> 00:32:43.935
- If he wants a family to come
back to.


557
00:32:43.935 --> 00:32:47.897
Besides, no one knows Syfal's
dead beyond that barn.


558
00:32:47.897 --> 00:32:51.192
The Resistance will just
look at him as some loner.


559
00:32:51.192 --> 00:32:52.777
- And from what we gathered,

560
00:32:52.777 --> 00:32:54.529
the king's protector may have
taken him


561
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:56.281
to the northern sector of the
city.


562
00:32:57.907 --> 00:32:59.576
- Well, you may not
need to concern yourself


563
00:32:59.576 --> 00:33:01.619
with his location any longer.

564
00:33:01.619 --> 00:33:05.248
I've just had a very clear
vision of him running down a
road


565
00:33:05.248 --> 00:33:06.499
alone.

566
00:33:06.499 --> 00:33:08.209
- Can you see which road he's
on?


567
00:33:08.209 --> 00:33:10.420
- No, which is why I brought you
here.


568
00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:12.463
As you know,

569
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:15.758
we stand in the mighty Forest of
SiKoran


570
00:33:17.051 --> 00:33:18.720
grown from the ashes of the
legendary monk


571
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.433
Reynu SiKoran himself,
thousand of years ago.


572
00:33:23.433 --> 00:33:26.936
His roots run deep within
Mother,


573
00:33:26.936 --> 00:33:29.814
linking us all in millions of
ways.


574
00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:34.611
I can use his essence to
find their exact location.


575
00:33:35.945 --> 00:33:38.489
- My love, entering into
an immortal's essence pool


576
00:33:38.489 --> 00:33:39.782
is suicide.

577
00:33:39.782 --> 00:33:41.242
It's too dangerous.

578
00:33:41.242 --> 00:33:42.869
It's pull is too strong.

579
00:33:42.869 --> 00:33:44.787
It could drain you till you're
dead.


580
00:33:44.787 --> 00:33:46.205
- Il
-Roserious is right.

581
00:33:46.205 --> 00:33:48.541
You very powerful my love,

582
00:33:48.541 --> 00:33:52.837
but SiKoran is one of the Five
Immortal Wonders of Ressear.


583
00:33:52.837 --> 00:33:54.505
No one has ever survived

584
00:33:54.505 --> 00:33:56.507
after tampering with their
essence pool.


585
00:34:01.304 --> 00:34:02.889
- None of them were me.

586
00:34:06.017 --> 00:34:09.395
It is time for SiKoran
and all life on Ressear


587
00:34:09.395 --> 00:34:11.064
to know that I am a God!

588
00:34:12.106 --> 00:34:15.109
(creature growling)

589
00:34:17.862 --> 00:34:20.073
Stay down you wicked creature!

590
00:34:20.073 --> 00:34:22.158
I am your Lord now!

591
00:34:22.158 --> 00:34:27.163
(creature growling)
(speaking in foreign language)


592
00:34:31.417 --> 00:34:34.504
You listen to me now Reynu!

593
00:34:34.504 --> 00:34:37.674
(creature screeching)

594
00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.391
(growling)

595
00:34:46.391 --> 00:34:47.558
Down creature!

596
00:35:01.447 --> 00:35:03.366
- My Lord you...

597
00:35:03.366 --> 00:35:04.659
What you did was...

598
00:35:05.576 --> 00:35:07.453
The power running through your
body


599
00:35:07.453 --> 00:35:09.706
would have killed the
strongest of art forms.


600
00:35:10.707 --> 00:35:11.833
How do you feel?

601
00:35:13.376 --> 00:35:14.544
- I feel marvelous!

602
00:35:15.712 --> 00:35:19.048
SiKorn's essence is everything I
imagined.


603
00:35:20.008 --> 00:35:22.176
And now he belongs to me.

604
00:35:22.176 --> 00:35:23.553
He's under my control.

605
00:35:24.971 --> 00:35:26.139
- Do you need anything?

606
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:29.392
- Yes.

607
00:35:29.392 --> 00:35:32.270
I need for you to bring me
the king's head in a bag


608
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:33.813
and place it on my table.

609
00:35:35.148 --> 00:35:37.692
I wanna be able to look him in
the eyes


610
00:35:37.692 --> 00:35:39.402
While I enjoy my meal.

611
00:35:40.653 --> 00:35:42.947
- Did you happen to see where he
is?


612
00:35:44.323 --> 00:35:47.160
(dramatic music)

613
00:35:48.786 --> 00:35:51.581
- The king is headed for the
Ti Forest on the west end.


614
00:35:52.582 --> 00:35:54.876
He'll be there within the hour.

615
00:35:54.876 --> 00:35:56.419
- You should join us my love.

616
00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:58.254
It will be fun.

617
00:35:59.422 --> 00:36:01.424
- You go enjoy yourselves.

618
00:36:01.424 --> 00:36:02.592
I have much to do.

619
00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.804
But hurry, we're having company
tonight.


620
00:36:06.804 --> 00:36:08.181
A new era has begun.

621
00:36:13.186 --> 00:36:15.688
(tense music)

622
00:36:17.815 --> 00:36:20.651
(dramatic music)

623
00:36:21.652 --> 00:36:23.946
You thought you can hide Yahzeel
from me,


624
00:36:23.946 --> 00:36:25.323
didn't you SiKoran?

625
00:36:26.074 --> 00:36:27.241
Do you need help, miss?

626
00:36:28.409 --> 00:36:30.369
You answer to me now.

627
00:36:30.369 --> 00:36:32.622
(growling)

628
00:36:32.622 --> 00:36:33.790
Once I revive Yahzeel

629
00:36:35.124 --> 00:36:38.127
and learn the art forms of the
Royal 4,


630
00:36:38.127 --> 00:36:41.506
I will be a god among gods.

631
00:36:41.506 --> 00:36:43.007
(dramatic music)

632
00:36:43.007 --> 00:36:43.841
Ressear,

633
00:36:43.966 --> 00:36:45.426
(Fire swoosh)

634
00:36:45.593 --> 00:36:46.844
Earth,

635
00:36:48.012 --> 00:36:51.641
and all living things will bow
before me.


636
00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.813
(dramatic music)

637
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.825
- Hello?

638
00:37:10.409 --> 00:37:11.244
Are you okay?

639
00:37:12.328 --> 00:37:13.830
My name, my name is Eric.

640
00:37:14.163 --> 00:37:15.832
Do you need help, Ms. Um...

641
00:37:17.959 --> 00:37:19.418
- Well, hello.

642
00:37:19.418 --> 00:37:22.171
(dramatic music)

643
00:37:24.507 --> 00:37:27.176
(Eric grunting)

644
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:30.096
- Who are you people?

645
00:37:30.096 --> 00:37:31.180
Are you with Sophia?

646
00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.348
- Sophia?

647
00:37:32.348 --> 00:37:35.601
I don't know any Sophia, but I
know you.


648
00:37:35.601 --> 00:37:39.522
My Lord says you are one of the
legendary Royal 4.


649
00:37:39.522 --> 00:37:41.732
- Look, I don't know what you're
talking about, okay?


650
00:37:41.732 --> 00:37:43.651
I am no king.

651
00:37:43.651 --> 00:37:45.862
- How did you know we were
talking about kings?


652
00:37:45.862 --> 00:37:47.280
- Does it matter?

653
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.114
Okay?

654
00:37:48.114 --> 00:37:50.533
I am not part of no Royal 4.

655
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:54.829
- Yes you are, yes you are.

656
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:58.499
Sil says you are the
reincarnation, one of the kings.


657
00:37:58.499 --> 00:38:00.710
So which one are you?

658
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:04.714
- (grunts) Look, this is just a
big misunderstanding, okay?


659
00:38:04.714 --> 00:38:05.590
I was held--

660
00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.258
(shushing)

661
00:38:07.258 --> 00:38:09.260
(Cayla sniffs)

662
00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.095
- You do smell different.

663
00:38:12.096 --> 00:38:14.724
- (grunts) Ah, bitch.

664
00:38:14.724 --> 00:38:16.767
- No, my name is Cayla.

665
00:38:18.561 --> 00:38:21.230
(ominous music)

666
00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.363
You are special.

667
00:38:29.363 --> 00:38:33.242
I've never tasted blood from an
ancient before.


668
00:38:33.242 --> 00:38:35.161
You could say you're my first.

669
00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:38.080
(metal scraping)

670
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.208
(Eric grunting)

671
00:38:40.208 --> 00:38:43.753
You haven't realized yet, but
before you do,


672
00:38:43.753 --> 00:38:45.796
Sil wants your head back in a
bag.


673
00:38:46.756 --> 00:38:49.133
Of course, I'd prefer to keep
you as my pet,


674
00:38:53.304 --> 00:38:54.513
but such is life.

675
00:38:56.098 --> 00:38:57.600
(whizzing)

676
00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.436
(dramatic music)

677
00:39:15.284 --> 00:39:17.286
- Sire, stay behind me.

678
00:39:23.251 --> 00:39:26.295
- Did you just hit me with a
rock?


679
00:39:26.295 --> 00:39:28.339
That wasn't very nice.

680
00:39:29.507 --> 00:39:32.134
So what do we call you?

681
00:39:33.636 --> 00:39:37.473
- My name is Sofia Hayden, army
commander of Merc.


682
00:39:39.558 --> 00:39:40.685
- The City of Merc?

683
00:39:42.561 --> 00:39:45.398
I thought we buried all you
cockroaches.


684
00:39:45.398 --> 00:39:47.650
- [Sofia] As long as I still
breath,


685
00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:49.694
Merc lives, Cayla Korvesian.

686
00:39:51.737 --> 00:39:53.406
- Oh, so you know me?

687
00:39:54.532 --> 00:39:58.411
- Of course, a sadistic bitch
with daddy issues.


688
00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:04.625
- Well, I killed daddy, so he's
not an issue anymore.


689
00:40:07.503 --> 00:40:10.881
Look, let's get this over with,
shall we?


690
00:40:10.881 --> 00:40:13.217
Hand over your king and I'll let
you live.


691
00:40:14.176 --> 00:40:15.803
- So let's get it over with.

692
00:40:18.848 --> 00:40:20.683
Talingol byne kon-yet.

693
00:40:22.435 --> 00:40:24.270
(fire roaring)

694
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.605
(whooshing)

695
00:40:34.447 --> 00:40:37.158
So what they say is true about
the Korvesians.


696
00:40:38.492 --> 00:40:41.329
Your bloodline is resistant to
chants.


697
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:43.039
- Well, this isn't fair.

698
00:40:43.039 --> 00:40:44.957
You know quite a bit about me,

699
00:40:44.957 --> 00:40:49.587
but I've never heard of you,
Sofia Hayden.


700
00:40:49.587 --> 00:40:51.047
- Commander Hayden to you!

701
00:40:53.883 --> 00:40:56.886
(pistol firing)

702
00:40:56.886 --> 00:40:59.638
(metal clanging)

703
00:41:02.058 --> 00:41:04.643
- Girl, if you wanna piece of
me,


704
00:41:04.643 --> 00:41:07.021
you're gonna have to do it the
old fashion way.


705
00:41:10.274 --> 00:41:13.986
- Then, so be it.

706
00:41:13.986 --> 00:41:16.989
(suspenseful music)

707
00:41:32.046 --> 00:41:37.051
(swords clanging) (tense music)

708
00:41:47.269 --> 00:41:50.231
(thuds) (Cayla grunts)

709
00:41:50.231 --> 00:41:53.025
(swords clanging)

710
00:41:53.025 --> 00:41:55.027
(thuds)

711
00:41:56.195 --> 00:41:57.822
(Sofia grunts)

712
00:41:57.822 --> 00:42:00.658
(inhales sharply)

713
00:42:18.759 --> 00:42:22.221
(swords faintly clanging)

714
00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.308
- The king is over there.

715
00:42:26.308 --> 00:42:28.644
I'm gonna go get the king, you
help Cayla.


716
00:42:33.315 --> 00:42:35.651
(tense music)

717
00:42:35.651 --> 00:42:37.653
(thuds)

718
00:42:39.071 --> 00:42:41.574
(Sofia sighs)

719
00:42:42.575 --> 00:42:44.743
- Come on soldier, you're not
gonna let


720
00:42:44.743 --> 00:42:46.996
a little tap on the jaw stop all
this fun.


721
00:42:54.336 --> 00:42:55.629
(swords clanging)

722
00:42:55.629 --> 00:42:58.632
(suspenseful music)

723
00:43:00.676 --> 00:43:02.011
- Come on, girl.

724
00:43:02.928 --> 00:43:07.933
Don't let a little push on the
jaw stop all this fun.


725
00:43:14.482 --> 00:43:17.443
(swords clanging)

726
00:43:17.443 --> 00:43:19.445
(thuds)

727
00:43:26.368 --> 00:43:29.205
(Sophia grunting)

728
00:43:38.672 --> 00:43:40.216
- Sofia, watch out!

729
00:43:54.605 --> 00:43:58.734
- By day or by night, I raise my
sword to the light,


730
00:43:58.734 --> 00:44:01.737
I raise my sword to fight.

731
00:44:01.737 --> 00:44:06.617
To protect the kingdom of Merc,
as mother as my might.


732
00:44:09.203 --> 00:44:10.079
(Tenan yells)

733
00:44:10.079 --> 00:44:12.206
(thuds)

734
00:44:12.206 --> 00:44:13.040
(whooshing) (scraping)

735
00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.333
(thuds)

736
00:44:14.333 --> 00:44:15.918
(gurgling)

737
00:44:15.918 --> 00:44:17.378
(whooshing)

738
00:44:17.378 --> 00:44:19.755
- Commander, you're all clear!

739
00:44:19.755 --> 00:44:20.798
Kick her ass!

740
00:44:24.301 --> 00:44:25.261
You alright?

741
00:44:25.261 --> 00:44:27.096
- Yeah, yeah.

742
00:44:27.096 --> 00:44:28.013
- Behind you, behind you!

743
00:44:28.013 --> 00:44:30.516
(tense music)

744
00:44:31.767 --> 00:44:33.936
- Ah, the famous Tenan Fy.

745
00:44:35.729 --> 00:44:36.564
(Tenan grunts)

746
00:44:36.564 --> 00:44:38.566
(thuds)

747
00:44:39.775 --> 00:44:42.278
(tense music)

748
00:44:48.492 --> 00:44:50.786
- I see you're still on the
wrong side of things--


749
00:44:50.786 --> 00:44:51.870
- Don't!

750
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:52.705
She's dead.

751
00:44:53.789 --> 00:44:58.377
I'm now IL-Roserious,
Quinsentian leader,


752
00:44:58.377 --> 00:45:00.963
better known as the Painted
Guard.


753
00:45:02.006 --> 00:45:06.176
And I am gonna make certain that
you fall!


754
00:45:07.136 --> 00:45:08.470
- How did it come to this?

755
00:45:09.888 --> 00:45:11.974
- My eyes are open, Tenan.

756
00:45:11.974 --> 00:45:13.309
Wake up!

757
00:45:13.309 --> 00:45:15.185
The Nebtonian life is over!

758
00:45:16.061 --> 00:45:18.522
This world belongs to Sil now.

759
00:45:18.522 --> 00:45:21.191
Accept it or die, Tenan.

760
00:45:22.985 --> 00:45:25.654
- Okay, fine.

761
00:45:25.654 --> 00:45:28.032
You choose to die by the hand of
an old friend,


762
00:45:28.949 --> 00:45:29.867
then come on!

763
00:45:30.701 --> 00:45:33.454
(dramatic music)

764
00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.841

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:10.032
(thuds)

770
00:46:11.158 --> 00:46:14.411
- Your skin can't hold up
against my blades forever,
Tenan!


771
00:46:14.411 --> 00:46:15.663
(grunts)

772
00:46:15.663 --> 00:46:20.542

(blades whooshing)

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.857
(Painted Guard yelling)

778
00:46:43.857 --> 00:46:44.692
- Fuck!

779
00:46:45.567 --> 00:46:46.402
(Painted Guard grunts)

780
00:46:46.402 --> 00:46:47.277
(Tenan grunts)

781
00:46:47.277 --> 00:46:49.279
(thuds)

(thuds)

787
00:47:13.804 --> 00:47:14.972
- Tam-ki-yian!

788
00:47:16.765 --> 00:47:18.600
(whooshing)

789
00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.144
(booming explosion)

00:47:20.144 --> 00:47:21.103
(ominous music)

(metallic rattling)

797
00:48:08.442 --> 00:48:10.277
- Look, I don't know how you
are,


798
00:48:10.277 --> 00:48:12.404
but you seem to be the reason
for all this.


799
00:48:12.404 --> 00:48:14.656
Stay down and don't move.

800
00:48:14.656 --> 00:48:15.991
- [Eric] Okay, okay.

801
00:48:15.991 --> 00:48:18.619
- And if I catch you trying to
leave, I'll kill you.


802
00:48:18.619 --> 00:48:19.495
- [Eric] Understood.

803
00:48:19.495 --> 00:48:24.500
- Okay? 
- Yeah.

804
00:48:25.918 --> 00:48:28.378
(tense music)

805

(thuds)

806
00:48:45.896 --> 00:48:47.064
- Threesome, huh?

807
00:48:48.398 --> 00:48:49.233
Okay.

808
00:48:55.364 --> 00:48:56.240
(Cayla yells)

809
00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.826
(Tenan grunts)

810
00:49:00.327 --> 00:49:01.703
You're a Croarthian!

811
00:49:02.955 --> 00:49:05.207
No matter, I'll find your weak
spot


812
00:49:05.207 --> 00:49:07.167
and I'll gut you all over this
forest!


813
00:49:08.794 --> 00:49:11.380
(low zapping)

814
00:49:18.303 --> 00:49:19.471
- Great shot, Chip!

815
00:49:22.432 --> 00:49:24.101
- Hey, guys!

816
00:49:24.101 --> 00:49:25.644
There's a guy, he's hurt.

817
00:49:28.438 --> 00:49:29.398
So, you're alright?

818
00:49:30.732 --> 00:49:32.734
- Yeah, yeah I think so.

819
00:49:32.734 --> 00:49:33.694
- What's your name?

820
00:49:35.237 --> 00:49:36.071
- Eric, Eric.

821
00:49:37.281 --> 00:49:39.116
- So your gonna thank me, Eric?

822
00:49:41.076 --> 00:49:44.830
- Yeah, yeah, thank you for
picking me up.


823
00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:47.875
- No, for saving your life.

824
00:49:47.875 --> 00:49:49.209
- Saving my life?

825
00:49:49.209 --> 00:49:52.087
- Yeah, she was waking up.

826
00:49:52.087 --> 00:49:55.299
She was gonna kill ya.

827
00:49:55.299 --> 00:49:57.426
- Yeah, yeah, thanks.

828
00:49:59.094 --> 00:50:00.470
- You're welcome.

829
00:50:02.097 --> 00:50:03.515
- We must kill her.

830
00:50:03.515 --> 00:50:05.100
She's too dangerous to survive.

831
00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:05.934
- I know.

832
00:50:07.102 --> 00:50:08.186
Now go help your king.

833
00:50:09.062 --> 00:50:10.397
I'll be there in a minute.

834
00:50:11.732 --> 00:50:12.608
- [Tenan Voiceover] King?

835
00:50:12.608 --> 00:50:14.610
What king is she talking about?

836
00:50:14.610 --> 00:50:19.323
- When I kill you, I want you to
know it's me.


837
00:50:19.323 --> 00:50:21.491
Until then, Cayla.

838
00:50:21.491 --> 00:50:23.285
- [Tenan] Sophia!

839
00:50:23.285 --> 00:50:25.370
(tense music)

840
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:28.749
(footsteps quickly rustling)

841
00:50:28.749 --> 00:50:30.959
(rustling)

842
00:50:34.838 --> 00:50:37.466
(inhales sharply)

843
00:50:37.466 --> 00:50:38.300
- Get off me!

844
00:50:40.302 --> 00:50:44.056
Take two of your men and head
that way.


845
00:50:44.056 --> 00:50:45.891
There are four of them.

846
00:50:45.891 --> 00:50:48.143
Bring me back the odd one.

847
00:50:49.978 --> 00:50:52.022
- Yes, Commander.

848
00:50:52.022 --> 00:50:54.191
You and you, come with me.

849
00:50:59.154 --> 00:51:03.867
- Commander, Lord Sil requests
you come home immediately.


850
00:51:03.867 --> 00:51:06.954
He's scheduled a meeting with
the committee.


851
00:51:06.954 --> 00:51:08.080
- Fine.

852
00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.456
Bring me my car.

853
00:51:12.167 --> 00:51:14.836
(ominous music)

854
00:52:13.854 --> 00:52:17.858
(whooshing)
(birds calling)


855
00:52:17.858 --> 00:52:20.694
(heavy footsteps)

856
00:52:57.522 --> 00:53:00.108
(chants words)

857
00:53:01.276 --> 00:53:03.904
(mysterious booming)

858
00:53:03.904 --> 00:53:05.489
- Come on, come on!

859
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.786
(chants words)

860
00:53:14.081 --> 00:53:15.624
- [Man] Akinnis!

861
00:53:15.624 --> 00:53:16.458
Akinnis!

862
00:53:21.797 --> 00:53:25.133
- [Goon] Are you trying to
build a bridge to Earth?


863
00:53:26.468 --> 00:53:27.969
That's a myth, soldier!

864
00:53:29.012 --> 00:53:33.308
Those rebels filled your head
with talk of a sister planet.


865
00:53:33.308 --> 00:53:39.314
Akinnis, do what's right,
and vow your allegiance to Sil.


866
00:53:39.773 --> 00:53:43.693
- I am getting really tired of
seeing your ugly face, Goon!


867
00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.866
(battle music)

868
00:53:53.245 --> 00:53:55.413
(roaring)

869
00:54:00.252 --> 00:54:02.838
(chants words)

870
00:54:05.674 --> 00:54:10.387
- [Goon] Akinnis, you really
think this will stop you?


871
00:54:10.387 --> 00:54:12.722
(whooshing)

872
00:54:23.358 --> 00:54:26.069
(battle music)

873
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.903
Argh!

874
00:54:42.377 --> 00:54:43.587
- Fucking Goon.

875
00:54:47.215 --> 00:54:49.426
(grunting)

876
00:54:52.596 --> 00:54:54.055
- [Goon] Akinnis!

877
00:54:55.599 --> 00:54:56.933
Give up already!

878
00:54:58.393 --> 00:55:01.438
Your band of rebels are all but
dead!


879
00:55:01.438 --> 00:55:02.939
Your race is dead.

880
00:55:04.232 --> 00:55:07.194
Sil is the true law of this
planet!


881
00:55:07.194 --> 00:55:09.487
Can't you see that?

882
00:55:09.487 --> 00:55:11.948
- Sil's days are numbered, the
royal four


883
00:55:11.948 --> 00:55:14.868
will return to put him down.

884
00:55:14.868 --> 00:55:17.329
- [Goon] You were once a
revered soldier of Merc,


885
00:55:18.371 --> 00:55:22.751
a legend of your race,
but look at you now.


886
00:55:22.751 --> 00:55:25.629
Running around, looking for
ghosts with a band of misfits.


887
00:55:28.089 --> 00:55:30.759
What would your dead family
think?


888
00:55:30.759 --> 00:55:31.968
(laughs)

889
00:55:31.968 --> 00:55:34.095
- Shut up and just die!

890
00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.266
(action music)

891
00:55:48.526 --> 00:55:50.779
(snapping)

892
00:56:03.708 --> 00:56:06.044
(whooshing)

893
00:56:07.796 --> 00:56:10.799
- [Creature] Shit, the children.

894
00:56:10.799 --> 00:56:12.467
- Go ahead, kill me!

895
00:56:13.802 --> 00:56:16.471
The kings will be found!

896
00:56:16.471 --> 00:56:18.223
And Sil will be done.

897
00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:29.526
(action music)

898
00:56:36.491 --> 00:56:38.994
(funky music)

899
00:57:17.741 --> 00:57:19.326
- Eric.

900
00:57:19.326 --> 00:57:20.535
Eric.

901
00:57:20.535 --> 00:57:21.453
Eric!

902
00:57:23.538 --> 00:57:25.373
- Yeah, I noticed that.

903
00:57:25.373 --> 00:57:26.875
Hey, you wanna hit that new bar

904
00:57:26.875 --> 00:57:28.710
around the corner after work?

905
00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:33.715
- Naw, I may just stay
home tonight and meditate.


906
00:57:34.007 --> 00:57:35.091
- Meditate?

907
00:57:35.091 --> 00:57:38.595
Look, Raquel's a bitch
bro, she played all of us.


908
00:57:38.595 --> 00:57:40.055
- Yeah maybe.

909
00:57:41.431 --> 00:57:43.475
- Yeah, you need to let her go.

910
00:57:43.475 --> 00:57:44.726
You need to meet me down to the
bar


911
00:57:44.726 --> 00:57:46.561
so we can find another Raquel.

912
00:57:46.561 --> 00:57:47.937
- Huh, what?

913
00:57:47.937 --> 00:57:49.689
- Yeah, I'm just saying.

914
00:57:55.445 --> 00:57:56.363
Damn!

915
00:57:59.282 --> 00:58:02.077
he is going to need a report
on each of these by the 16th.


916
00:58:02.077 --> 00:58:04.746
- The 16th, that only
leaves me 5 days, Monica,


917
00:58:04.746 --> 00:58:05.663
I don't know if--

918
00:58:05.663 --> 00:58:07.582
- Well you need to.

919
00:58:07.582 --> 00:58:10.543
If you have a problem with
it take it up with Mills.


920
00:58:10.543 --> 00:58:13.463
And you know what, that
means you will be fired.


921
00:58:13.463 --> 00:58:14.631
So pick your poison.

922
00:58:15.548 --> 00:58:18.051
- Yeah, yeah, I'll get on it,
it's fine.


923
00:58:19.928 --> 00:58:21.304
- Jimmy, would you mind?

924
00:58:21.304 --> 00:58:23.932
- You know Monika, your horns
are showing.


925
00:58:23.932 --> 00:58:24.849
- Eff you Jimmy!

926
00:58:27.685 --> 00:58:29.312
- That's one crazy bitch.

927
00:58:30.397 --> 00:58:34.526
Hey, five thirty, me, you,
women, new bar?


928
00:58:34.526 --> 00:58:36.152
- Man, you heard that demon.

929
00:58:36.152 --> 00:58:37.987
I gotta get this done by next
week


930
00:58:37.987 --> 00:58:40.281
and I need all the time that I
can get.


931
00:58:41.157 --> 00:58:46.121
- Look, you need to relax and
get laid before you explode.


932
00:58:47.789 --> 00:58:49.124
I'm gonna help you this weekend

933
00:58:49.124 --> 00:58:51.626
and get this project done, okay?

934
00:58:51.626 --> 00:58:53.461
- Come on Jimmy, seriously.

935
00:58:54.295 --> 00:58:55.964
Hey let me ask you something.

936
00:58:57.132 --> 00:58:58.758
Have you ever felt you were
meant for


937
00:58:58.758 --> 00:59:02.387
something larger in life, you
know, like something better


938
00:59:02.387 --> 00:59:04.222
than where we are now?

939
00:59:04.222 --> 00:59:06.474
- What, Eric what are you
talking about?


940
00:59:06.474 --> 00:59:08.560
- You know, like you
were meant for something


941
00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:10.895
more meaningful that can change
the world?


942
00:59:10.895 --> 00:59:13.231
- Eric are you smoking your
socks?


943
00:59:13.231 --> 00:59:14.315
- I'm serious Jimmy,

944
00:59:14.315 --> 00:59:18.319
I feel like something big
is coming my way real soon.


945
00:59:18.319 --> 00:59:20.655
- I hope so, boobs, in your
face.


946
00:59:20.655 --> 00:59:22.657
- I'm serious bro, I
don't know what it is,


947
00:59:22.657 --> 00:59:24.701
but something is coming.

948
00:59:25.743 --> 00:59:28.997
- All I know is, you need to get
laid.


949
00:59:28.997 --> 00:59:32.333
You need to meet me tonight, at
the bar,


950
00:59:33.918 --> 00:59:35.295
with the bitches.

951
00:59:49.017 --> 00:59:52.187
[Mysterious Voices] Help us,
hurry.


952
00:59:52.187 --> 00:59:54.272
Help us, hurry.

953
00:59:54.272 --> 00:59:56.691
- Jimmy, stop screwing around.

954
00:59:58.026 --> 01:00:02.071
- [Mysterious Voices] Come back,
help us.


955
01:00:02.071 --> 01:00:04.449
- Jimmy, you know what,
if you're out there.


956
01:00:07.285 --> 01:00:10.038
- [Mysterious Voices] Remember.

957
01:00:10.038 --> 01:00:10.872
- Jimmy?

958
01:00:12.373 --> 01:00:13.208
Anybody?

959
01:00:16.669 --> 01:00:18.379
I think I'll have those drinks
now.


960
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.566
- Let's do a toast, hey, my man
Eric!


961
01:00:39.651 --> 01:00:41.277
- [Crowd] Eric!

962
01:00:41.277 --> 01:00:43.530
(cheering)

963
01:00:47.534 --> 01:00:50.662
- Hey Jimmy, hey everyone,
thank you, thank you.


964
01:00:50.662 --> 01:00:52.997
- Glad to see you're gonna
live a little bit, huh?


965
01:00:54.582 --> 01:00:57.377
- Yeah yeah, I just needed
to take a break, that's all.


966
01:00:58.211 --> 01:01:01.923
- Look, Mills and watchdog,
don't worry about them, man,


967
01:01:01.923 --> 01:01:03.925
we'll get you a job somewhere
else.


968
01:01:03.925 --> 01:01:05.635
- Yeah, true, I just
don't want to start over


969
01:01:05.635 --> 01:01:08.471
somewhere else with some new
assholes and new ass rules.


970
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:12.100
- There's gonna be assholes
you're gonna deal with in life,


971
01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.935
all the time, E.

972
01:01:13.935 --> 01:01:16.396
Your job is not let them
get you in your heart.


973
01:01:17.564 --> 01:01:20.233
- Yeah, thanks Jimmy,
you made sense for once.


974
01:01:20.233 --> 01:01:22.485
- Oh, you're trying to
be Mr Funny Man now, huh?


975
01:01:22.485 --> 01:01:23.319
- Hey Jim,

976
01:01:25.321 --> 01:01:27.490
buy me a drink Jimmy.

977
01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:28.616
- What's in it for me?

978
01:01:30.159 --> 01:01:31.703
- Think of something.

979
01:01:31.703 --> 01:01:33.288
- Slick, let me get another two.

980
01:01:45.592 --> 01:01:47.927
(footsteps)

981
01:01:54.684 --> 01:01:55.518
- Ahem.

982
01:01:56.728 --> 01:01:57.562
- Oh hi.

983
01:01:58.688 --> 01:01:59.564
- I'm Sofia.

984
01:02:01.899 --> 01:02:05.820
- Sofia, er, hi, I'm Eric, Eric
Wilson.


985
01:02:07.113 --> 01:02:08.281
- Go Eric!

986
01:02:12.035 --> 01:02:14.162
- Oh, I'm sorry, were you
sitting here?


987
01:02:14.162 --> 01:02:15.913
- I just saw you with your
friend.


988
01:02:17.123 --> 01:02:18.833
He look like he'd rather buy
drinks


989
01:02:18.833 --> 01:02:20.335
than hang with hims friend.

990
01:02:21.419 --> 01:02:23.338
- Well you have to get to know
Jimmy


991
01:02:23.338 --> 01:02:25.131
to understand that he's a good
guy.


992
01:02:27.175 --> 01:02:30.011
Oh, I'm sorry, would you like to
sit down?


993
01:02:30.011 --> 01:02:31.012
- [Sofia] Thank you.

994
01:02:34.849 --> 01:02:37.226
- Is everything all right, did
I spill something on my face,


995
01:02:37.226 --> 01:02:38.936
or did I spill something on
myself?


996
01:02:38.936 --> 01:02:40.688
- No, no you look good.
- Oh.


997
01:02:40.688 --> 01:02:44.317
- You just look familiar, that's
all.


998
01:02:44.317 --> 01:02:47.695
- So, erm, do you come here
often?


999
01:02:47.695 --> 01:02:50.114
Oh no no no, that was so
bad, I'm sorry, just, I'm.


1000
01:02:50.114 --> 01:02:50.948
- Relax.

1001
01:02:51.908 --> 01:02:53.993
(laughs)

1002
01:02:59.957 --> 01:03:03.211
- And that's why got
punished for two weeks.


1003
01:03:04.879 --> 01:03:08.841
- So I guess you played it
safe and became an analyst.


1004
01:03:08.841 --> 01:03:10.551
- Yeah, I guess you could say
that.


1005
01:03:11.761 --> 01:03:15.264
It pays the bills, but um,
can I ask you something?


1006
01:03:16.224 --> 01:03:18.059
No no, nevermind, forget it.

1007
01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:20.978
- Too late, what is it?

1008
01:03:21.854 --> 01:03:23.356
- Well,

1009
01:03:23.356 --> 01:03:28.152
sometimes I feel that I'm
destined for bigger things,


1010
01:03:28.152 --> 01:03:31.280
like something important
is going to happen


1011
01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:36.285
and I can be free of
this everyday hum drum.


1012
01:03:36.285 --> 01:03:38.913
I don't know, it' just crazy
talk, but.


1013
01:03:38.913 --> 01:03:42.375
- Not at all, I believe that

1014
01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:47.380
everyone was someone else
at one time or another


1015
01:03:47.588 --> 01:03:51.426
in another life, if you
believe in that sort of things.


1016
01:03:51.426 --> 01:03:54.303
- Actually, I do, I feel like
I'm built


1017
01:03:54.303 --> 01:03:55.763
in a different day and age,

1018
01:03:55.763 --> 01:03:57.765
you know like at a different
time,


1019
01:03:57.765 --> 01:04:01.269
and I have the ability
to make a positive impact


1020
01:04:01.269 --> 01:04:02.854
in people's lives.

1021
01:04:02.854 --> 01:04:05.940
- Well, let's talk about
going somewhere different.


1022
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:08.317
- Sure, yeah, where would you
like to go?


1023
01:04:09.944 --> 01:04:11.738
- I know this great lounge
across town


1024
01:04:11.738 --> 01:04:13.906
that makes great wings.

1025
01:04:13.906 --> 01:04:16.826
- Wings and a lounge, sign me
up.


1026
01:04:16.826 --> 01:04:18.369
- I'll get the cab.

1027
01:04:18.369 --> 01:04:19.287
- And I'll be back.

1028
01:04:26.753 --> 01:04:29.088
You got this Eric, you got this.

1029
01:04:29.088 --> 01:04:30.631
Can't screw this up, all right.

1030
01:04:30.631 --> 01:04:32.800
You're a man, you're a man.

1031
01:04:34.802 --> 01:04:36.012
We can do this.

1032
01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.695
- I got it, crazy!

1033
01:05:01.996 --> 01:05:04.791
- [Eric] So what's this
place called again?


1034
01:05:04.791 --> 01:05:06.417
- [Sofia] I forget,

1035
01:05:06.417 --> 01:05:09.879
but I already told the driver
where to go.


1036
01:05:13.466 --> 01:05:15.676
(groaning)

1037
01:05:17.136 --> 01:05:19.764
(birds calling)

1038
01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:38.825
- Where am I?

1039
01:05:39.659 --> 01:05:41.244
Where is everybody?

1040
01:05:45.456 --> 01:05:46.290
Jimmy?

1041
01:05:48.167 --> 01:05:49.001
Sofia?

1042
01:06:35.256 --> 01:06:37.592
(screeching)

1043
01:06:37.592 --> 01:06:39.093
What is that?

1044
01:06:39.093 --> 01:06:41.262
(yelling)

1045
01:06:44.181 --> 01:06:46.601
(leaves rustling)

1046
01:06:46.601 --> 01:06:49.353
(sinister music)

1047
01:07:01.616 --> 01:07:04.035
(screeching)

1048
01:07:07.079 --> 01:07:08.956
Get away from me!

1049
01:07:08.956 --> 01:07:09.916
Get off me!

1050
01:07:31.729 --> 01:07:35.441
- [Figure] Come on, get up,
they'll be back soon, move!


1051
01:07:35.441 --> 01:07:38.027
(action music)

1052
01:08:36.794 --> 01:08:38.546
- Is it one of therm?

1053
01:08:39.922 --> 01:08:40.756
- Yes.

1054
01:08:42.049 --> 01:08:44.010
- Is it a king, or the queen?

1055
01:08:45.678 --> 01:08:47.138
- King, perhaps.

1056
01:08:49.432 --> 01:08:51.642
- Can you tell if he has
realized yet?


1057
01:08:54.854 --> 01:08:57.565
- I don't believe he has
realized who he is, yet.


1058
01:08:58.566 --> 01:09:01.485
This cloak over his location
I haven't felt before.


1059
01:09:02.361 --> 01:09:06.032
- Sire, who is this king
you are concerned with?


1060
01:09:08.659 --> 01:09:12.204
- Cayla, do you remember when
your father had you put away?


1061
01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.373
For you own good, he said.

1062
01:09:15.249 --> 01:09:20.254
Said your ways were, how did
he put it, unconventional.


1063
01:09:20.588 --> 01:09:22.298
- [Cayla] Yes.

1064
01:09:22.298 --> 01:09:23.799
- But you didn't believe that.

1065
01:09:25.051 --> 01:09:28.846
Slaughtering your entire
family was mighty cold.


1066
01:09:28.846 --> 01:09:30.431
Overkill, perhaps.

1067
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:34.810
But you were simply
nourishing your true nature.


1068
01:09:34.810 --> 01:09:36.854
The real Cayla was born that
night.


1069
01:09:36.854 --> 01:09:40.399
- Yes, a glorious evening it
was.


1070
01:09:41.692 --> 01:09:46.155
- This king wants to destroy
everything we've built


1071
01:09:46.155 --> 01:09:49.075
and stand in the way of our
progress.


1072
01:09:49.075 --> 01:09:51.368
- Yes, sire, but,

1073
01:09:51.368 --> 01:09:54.080
haven't we killed all
of the opposing kings?


1074
01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:54.955
- Not this one.

1075
01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:57.541
This is one returned.

1076
01:09:59.126 --> 01:10:00.628
One of those who imprisoned
Yahzeel


1077
01:10:00.628 --> 01:10:02.129
two thousand years ago.

1078
01:10:03.672 --> 01:10:05.800
I just can't be sure which one
it is.


1079
01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:07.009
- The legend?

1080
01:10:07.009 --> 01:10:09.303
Of the queen and three kings.

1081
01:10:10.137 --> 01:10:11.222
I thought that was a myth.

1082
01:10:11.222 --> 01:10:14.892
- This is no myth, he is one of
them.


1083
01:10:14.892 --> 01:10:16.560
And you need to make him go
away.


1084
01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:20.231
Go and make him a myth for me,

1085
01:10:22.024 --> 01:10:23.317
and bring me back his head.

1086
01:10:23.317 --> 01:10:25.486
- It would be a pleasure, sire,

1087
01:10:25.486 --> 01:10:28.864
I can't wait to taste
the blood of an ancient.


1088
01:10:28.864 --> 01:10:31.158
How would I identify him?

1089
01:10:31.158 --> 01:10:32.743
- He will stand out.

1090
01:10:32.743 --> 01:10:35.162
He'll be the one they all
protect.


1091
01:10:35.162 --> 01:10:38.666
Go, be quick, he'll be a
bigger problem if he realizes.


1092
01:10:47.341 --> 01:10:49.677
- Sil, the children,

1093
01:10:51.178 --> 01:10:53.681
I feel they're in some sort of
pain.


1094
01:10:54.515 --> 01:10:55.558
That's impossible.

1095
01:10:58.686 --> 01:11:01.897
with ancient magic, well the
ancient magic can affect them.


1096
01:11:02.773 --> 01:11:04.900
So either his protector is well-
versed,


1097
01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:07.444
or the ancient essence
running through his veins


1098
01:11:07.444 --> 01:11:08.696
is enough to protect him.

1099
01:11:09.655 --> 01:11:13.325
- Maybe not, maybe it was
the level of intensity


1100
01:11:13.325 --> 01:11:16.537
and energy that we unleashed
in our last takeover.


1101
01:11:16.537 --> 01:11:19.123
It could have made a rip between
worlds.


1102
01:11:19.123 --> 01:11:20.541
- No, I would have felt it.

1103
01:11:21.542 --> 01:11:23.669
I didn't feel it open this time.

1104
01:11:25.546 --> 01:11:27.089
We gotta field this king.

1105
01:11:29.758 --> 01:11:31.760
This is not good.

1106
01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:35.306
- Sil, our time is here and now.

1107
01:11:35.306 --> 01:11:38.309
We need to find and resurrect
Yahzeel immediately,


1108
01:11:38.309 --> 01:11:41.729
and end this fear of kings and
queens.


1109
01:11:42.646 --> 01:11:44.440
You are the only king.

1110
01:11:45.274 --> 01:11:48.527
You are the only real king
Ressear needs.


1111
01:11:50.112 --> 01:11:52.531
Everything is yours.

1112
01:11:52.531 --> 01:11:54.783
One Cayla Find and kills that
creature,


1113
01:11:54.783 --> 01:11:57.620
he will be a myth once more.

1114
01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:00.247
Let's continue with the plan

1115
01:12:00.247 --> 01:12:03.500
and become the god you are meant
to be.


1116
01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.085
- You are something, aren't you?

1117
01:12:06.086 --> 01:12:08.422
Prepare the plane for
home, we have much to do.


1118
01:12:44.124 --> 01:12:46.252
(snarls)

1119
01:12:55.094 --> 01:12:57.221
- [Figure] Come, on come on,
move.


1120
01:12:57.221 --> 01:12:59.390
(panting)

1121
01:13:00.808 --> 01:13:02.643
Come on, come on.

1122
01:13:02.643 --> 01:13:03.978
- Wait, wait, wait.

1123
01:13:03.978 --> 01:13:06.063
(grunts)

1124
01:13:08.065 --> 01:13:10.651
(chants words)

1125
01:13:15.948 --> 01:13:18.200
(groaning)

1126
01:13:21.078 --> 01:13:23.664
(chants words)

1127
01:13:26.333 --> 01:13:28.794
Look, look, look, I
have money int he bank,


1128
01:13:28.794 --> 01:13:30.045
I can give you it, I promise,

1129
01:13:30.045 --> 01:13:31.964
if you let me go I won't
say anything to anyone,


1130
01:13:31.964 --> 01:13:32.798
I don't even know--

1131
01:13:32.798 --> 01:13:33.674
- [Figure] Be quiet!

1132
01:13:40.848 --> 01:13:42.933
Does anything look familiar to
you?


1133
01:13:42.933 --> 01:13:45.102
- No, no, it doesn't.

1134
01:13:53.777 --> 01:13:55.237
- Hello, Eric.

1135
01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.114
- Sofia?

1136
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:59.158
Whoa re you?

1137
01:13:59.158 --> 01:14:01.702
Why, why are you dressed liked
that?


1138
01:14:01.702 --> 01:14:02.995
What the fuck is going on?

1139
01:14:05.205 --> 01:14:09.960
- You are the beginning
piece of saving our planet.


1140
01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:11.545
- Saving our planet?

1141
01:14:11.545 --> 01:14:13.881
Look, I don't know what
kind of drugs you're on,


1142
01:14:13.881 --> 01:14:16.050
but I know a facility that
can help you with that--


1143
01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:18.385
- Shut up, and listen to me!

1144
01:14:19.386 --> 01:14:22.723
You need to remember who you
really are.


1145
01:14:24.892 --> 01:14:28.020
Remember when you told me
about a feeling you had


1146
01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:30.606
of being part of something
larger?


1147
01:14:30.606 --> 01:14:34.151
Something important,
something worth fighting for?


1148
01:14:35.027 --> 01:14:38.322
Well that day is today.

1149
01:14:42.242 --> 01:14:43.285
Welcome back, sire.

1150
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:46.538
- Sire?

1151
01:14:46.538 --> 01:14:47.873
What?

1152
01:14:47.873 --> 01:14:50.751
