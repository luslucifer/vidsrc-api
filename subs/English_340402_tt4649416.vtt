00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.472
<i>It's</i> a
<i>beautiful Birmingham morning</i>


2
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.156
<i>and the holiday season
looks merry and bright.</i>


3
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.238
<i>Are you ready for the holidays?</i>

4
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.675
<i>Not me.</i>

5
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.918
<i>Man, I got five kids.</i>

6
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.560
<i>Four of them are mine.</i>

7
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.399
<i>Allegedly.</i>

8
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.719
<i>Have you been naughty?
Or have you been nice?</i>


9
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.672
<i>So many people coming into town.</i>

10
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.751
<i>What about you?</i>

11
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.559
<i>You got family or friends
coming to town?</i>


12
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:06.197
<i>Me?</i>

13
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.591
<i>I hope it's not my in-laws.</i>

14
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.274
<i>Unless they're listening.</i>

15
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.196
<i>If so, I can't wait to see ya!</i>

16
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.995
<i>On the way, a little music to
get you in the holiday spirit.</i>


17
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.196
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

18
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.876
Yeah.

19
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.751
All right.

20
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.196
Here we go.

21
00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.431
I'm sorry.
I need to take this. Here.


22
00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:00.831
Daddy, what's going on?
Your message sounded urgent.


23
00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.436
I can't find that tin of hers.

24
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.000
The ones with Mama's recipes?

25
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.151
<i>Yeah.</i>

26
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.676
They're where the pots
and pans are, Daddy.


27
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.195
You're not trying
to cook, are you?


28
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.557
Not without those recipes,
I'm not.


29
00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.677
Okay, good.

30
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.910
Now, don't drive yourself
too crazy with it, all right?


31
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.520
You know how you can get.

32
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.479
<i>I can't wait to see you all.</i>

33
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.712
Even your sister?

34
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.555
<i>I can count on you two to be
civil with each other, right?</i>


35
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.519
Yeah, of course.
I can't wait to see Rachel.


36
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.639
<i>I'll be civil with her as
long as she's civil with me.</i>


37
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.046
You know,
I'm looking forward to it.


38
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.150
Rach, can I please
finish what I'm saying?


39
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.519
Look, I'm just saying that we all want to
spend as much time as we can with Dad.


40
00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.326
What's wrong with me trying
to get you there faster?


41
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.390
<i>I'm not some charity case.</i>

42
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.752
Just because I'm in law school doesn't
mean I can't afford to buy plane tickets.


43
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.990
That's exactly what it means.

44
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.436
We talked about this.

45
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.520
Ma'am?
Yes?


46
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:48.921
This tire's got a hole in it.

47
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.473
Just put on the spare.

48
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.350
You mean, one of the two
you're already using?


49
00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.514
Hey! Yeah, I gotta go.

50
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.792
Well, there's always the bus.

51
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:02.951
Why?

52
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.086
Promise me you are not gonna be
on that phone the entire holiday.


53
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.111
I'm not. That was Rach.

54
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.557
And you do realize I'm in the
middle of a campaign, right?


55
00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.041
Yes, and I support you.

56
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.236
Give me that bunny!

57
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.391
No!

58
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.517
Slow, please.

59
00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.550
But family time is important too, which
is why you have a campaign manager.


60
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.273
Besides, it's only a week.

61
00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.632
Promise me we'll have fun
at your dad's.


62
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:27.791
Promise.

63
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.471
Family time.

64
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:36.076
I was cutting it off.

65
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.312
I thought you were
getting here last night?


66
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.075
Well, coach dropped another practice
on us, but I'm on my way now.


67
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.232
All right, all right.
Just drive safe.


68
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.598
And none of that Tweetbooking,
or Faceprogramming


69
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.910
<i>or Snap whatever that is, okay?</i>

70
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.031
Dad, it's...

71
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:51.446
I gotta go. Yeah.
I'ma see you soon.


72
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.471
Okay. I love you.

73
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:54.518
Love you too, Pops.
No, stay down. Stay down.


74
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:58.078
Got an early Christmas gift.

75
00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.121
Shoulder's good as new.
Yes!


76
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.716
You can finally get off those
meds and back on the field


77
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.714
because you've been cleared
for the bowl game!


78
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:07.791
Yes!

79
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.635
Yo, 88 is back
in the building, man!


80
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.075
Yeah. Thank you, Coach.

81
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.477
Listen, I am really proud of all the hard
work you've been putting in lately.


82
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.551
Thanks.

83
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:22.321
And I know that this is gonna be
your first holiday at home since...


84
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:23.391
Coach, you know what?

85
00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.795
I'm really good. I'm good.

86
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.560
All right. Happy holidays.

87
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.956
Yeah, same.

88
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:34.033
All right.
Listen up, everyone.


89
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.318
I don't want you pigging out
over the holidays.


90
00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:37.437
Gotta win this thing.

91
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:39.399
Come on, Coach.
It's Christmas!


92
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.481
I love how the ring
just glimmers.


93
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.279
See? When the light hits it?

94
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.439
I was a champion in Croatia.

95
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.080
You know I played
in the NBA also?


96
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.312
1991, Seattle SuperSonics.

97
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.712
I made the last shot
in the playoffs.


98
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.953
They called me
Lonnie "Shatao" Maclay.


99
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:10.030
You know what Shatao is?

100
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:13.438
Shatao is the sound that the ball
makes when it goes through the net.


101
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.877
Shatao! Like, Shatao!

102
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.317
So, would you like
a mid-size or a sedan?


103
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.438
Could I get a little
help here, Lonnie, huh?


104
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:21.557
A sedan!

105
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.473
What are you talking
about over there?


106
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:25.279
Will you help me with the bags?

107
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.752
Here's a little
early Christmas gift.


108
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.517
Could be worth a lot
of money on eBay.


109
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.155
But let it marinate.

110
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.595
Okay. Okay?

111
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.351
Lonnie!

112
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.830
Did you bring those damn cards?

113
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.631
Shatao!

114
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.911
Your face.

115
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:56.951
Yeah.

116
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:11.356
Shit!

117
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.511
Yeah!

118
00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:36.435
Oh, man.

119
00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:39.591
I'm trying.

120
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:57.200
May Devaroux, Johnson, Davis...

121
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:58.715
Shit, there was a lot of them.

122
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.993
I am here. And how's my
favorite brother-in-law doing?


123
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:04.991
May, I'm your only
brother-in-law.


124
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:06.521
Well, lucky you!

125
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:09.356
Damn, I forgot how old you are.

126
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.600
Come on, give it to me.

127
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:14.875
How you doing, baby?

128
00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:15.951
It's coming.

129
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.201
It's coming.

130
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.471
You holding on?

131
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:20.551
I'm holding on.

132
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.711
You holding on, baby.

133
00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:26.751
Yeah, I was expecting you
in a day, or two, or three...


134
00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:28.560
If I'd have known,
I would have...


135
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.439
Dusted. Damn, Walter!

136
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.190
Changed the locks.

137
00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:35.198
Your ass is old, so I'm
gonna let that one slide.


138
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.721
Now, I just thought my brother-in-law
could use a little extra help


139
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.235
so I said, what the hell.

140
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.115
And Stevie Wonder blind ass
done canceled the tour


141
00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:44.526
because they gave him
the schedule.


142
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.838
Who gonna give his blind ass
the schedule? Damn!


143
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.674
Messing with my money, baby.

144
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.957
But such is the life
of a background singer.


145
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:56.759
Now, listen, my bags are in the driveway
so be a dear and go get them for me.


146
00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:58.206
And I'ma whip
a little something up


147
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.966
so the kids have something
to eat when they get here.


148
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.118
Perfect. As long as
I don't have to eat it.


149
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.273
Walter Meyers, you can kiss
all my ass, okay?


150
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.274
You know the shit I cook is
good shit. Don't do that now.


151
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.070
You've been eating that bad shit.
That's why your ass looks so frail.


152
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.960
Look at yourself.
Knees knocking and shit.


153
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.436
And where's the liquor, Walter?

154
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.678
And I hope it ain't
that dark liquor, damn it.


155
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.799
Because that dark liquor
make a bitch wanna fight!


156
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.150
<i>Pop-pop!</i>

157
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.081
We made it!

158
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.800
Hi, Grandpa!
Hi!


159
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:28.599
You're even prettier
than I last saw you.


160
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:32.000
Yeah! How do you do that?

161
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.071
I don't know.

162
00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.720
How you doing, Granddad?

163
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.873
You still hitting those books, I see.
Yes, sir.


164
00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.715
Yes, he got six A's and one B.

165
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.280
The B was in gym.

166
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:45.075
When your Uncle Evan gets here,
he can help you out with that.


167
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.959
Grandpa, can I go inside
and get some cookies?


168
00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.395
Of course you can!

169
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:51.394
Cameron! Just one. Just one!
I want some too!


170
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.566
It'll be fine. Just, come on.
Honey?


171
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.766
He's always working.
Give me a second.


172
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:54.996
Sweetheart!

173
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:56.754
Hey! Hey! Hey! Pop!

174
00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.481
Man, don't do that.

175
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:01.831
Aw!

176
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:04.391
How are you, Pop?

177
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:07.599
I'm a little tired, but a
lot better seeing you all.


178
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.192
Oh, my God! ls that...

179
00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.001
Christian, you promised.
Family time.


180
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:14.966
No, no. That's what this will...
That's what this is.


181
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.073
He's here so that I won't have
to be on the phone as much.


182
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:20.198
Which gives me more time for family.
Oh, my God.


183
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:21.646
Andy Brooks.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.


184
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.086
He's my campaign manager, Pop.

185
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.831
Boy, you have raised a very
promising, young, future congressman


186
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.561
and his beautiful wife,
who you didn't raise.


187
00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.836
You raised him. 
He's your son.

188
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.630
Hope that doesn't come
as a surprise to you.


189
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.566
I didn't know you're
campaigning over the holidays.


190
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.671
These cookies are amazing!

191
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:36.831
Give me that.

192
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:39.636
Hey, Cameron. Take
your aunt's luggage in. There.


193
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.155
That's a lot of luggage.

194
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:42.755
Probably half of them are wigs.

195
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.321
Hey, and take yours in.

196
00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.551
We're staying here?

197
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:48.001
Mmm-hmm.
Yay!


198
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.721
Hold on, son. We're not staying here.
We're staying at a hotel.


199
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:52.121
We are staying at the hotel?

200
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:54.238
I thought we were. I assumed.
Let me talk.


201
00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.596
No.
No.


202
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:58.753
Pop, we got a hotel room because
we didn't wanna be a bother.


203
00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:00.514
Family is never a bother.

204
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.594
We're all going
to stay right here.


205
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.752
The kids can sleep in
the bunk beds in the basement.


206
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:07.320
Aw! Thanks, Pop.
Yeah. Okay.


207
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.119
This is great.
Sounds good to me.


208
00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.794
Sounds good to you?

209
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.315
Really, Brooks?

210
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.598
You know what?
I'm gonna like that hotel.


211
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:18.800
It's actually a really good hotel. They
got a free breakfast and a free spa.


212
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:21.396
And I encourage everybody
to join me. For the breakfast.


213
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:24.201
I think the four of us
in a spa would...


214
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.406
Just a little bit. Thanks.
Okay.


215
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:27.846
This is the last time
I'm gonna let you...


216
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:29.076
I know. I know.

217
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.079
He's a lot, but he's
the best at what he does.


218
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:32.390
Sir, sir.

219
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:36.757
I just wanted to express
my condolences on your loss.


220
00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:40.152
The African American woman is the
backbone of the black family.


221
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:42.153
Really of the whole
American family.


222
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.757
I mean, who wasn't raised by a black woman?
I know I was.


223
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:46.926
You know what?
I'm getting a phone call,


224
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:50.511
so I'm gonna have to put a
pause on this conversation,


225
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.001
which I'm really
enjoying. It's...


226
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.756
You're a wonderful conversationalist.
I hope someone's told you that.


227
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.241
Dan! Dan, you said
the call was in 15 minutes.


228
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:00.911
See them at the game.

229
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:03.078
Yeah, man. I got the pics.
I'm on my way.


230
00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.800
Hey, what's up?
Hey, Evan.


231
00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.511
I got them, man.
I'm on my way right now.


232
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:10.566
I'ma hit you tomorrow though,
because I can't kick it tonight.


233
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:11.796
I'ma hit you after church.

234
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.601
Boy, you ain't going to church, man.
Get outta here.


235
00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.161
No, no! No, I got it.
All right.


236
00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:27.073
I got it.
Happy holidays.


237
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.190
Okay.

238
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:33.311
Twigs!

239
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:34.791
Who's Twigs?

240
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.073
My nickname in high school.

241
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:39.238
Rachel, Rachel, Rachel.
What's up?


242
00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.516
Hey!

243
00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:42.161
You must be Niya.

244
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:44.710
We haven't been properly
introduced. I'm Malachi.


245
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:46.191
Nice to meet you.

246
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.079
Let me grab these bags.
I got it.


247
00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.079
Don't bother. Let me
help you with your bags.


248
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.152
Why? Because I'm a woman,
I can't help myself?


249
00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:54.956
No. Because I'm a grown man,
and that's what grown men do.


250
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:56.191
Munchie?

251
00:15:56.390 --> 00:16:00.315
Munchie, don't forget to get the
Eskimo Pies from the store, baby.


252
00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:01.391
Okay, Mama.

253
00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:04.713
And would you get
me the vinegar potato chips, baby?


254
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.276
All right, and a mud pie.

255
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:07.556
Okay, Mama.

256
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:09.755
Hey, Rachel!

257
00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:11.997
You know he's single.

258
00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.191
Ha.

259
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:15.833
Rach!
Auntie!


260
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.594
Hey!
Hi, baby!


261
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.511
Hey, Malachi!

262
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:21.835
Cameron! Dee!

263
00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:27.070
So, where's your husband?

264
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:30.800
Ex-husband.
Yeah?


265
00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.952
Oh. Oh.

266
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:37.159
Since I'm here visiting my mom for
the week, maybe we can grab a...


267
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:38.231
I'm okay.

268
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:42.601
You sure you don't want a hand?

269
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:43.911
No, thanks.

270
00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.112
No, no. No, I got it. Thank you.
You sure?


271
00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.470
It's not a problem.
No. I got it.


272
00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.921
Those bags look heavy.

273
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:50.111
I got it.

274
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.158
Clearly,
it's a different technique.


275
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:56.756
See? I had it.

276
00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.231
Had it the whole time.
I do Pilates. So...


277
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:01.791
This girl.

278
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:03.679
Somebody come
help me with these bags!


279
00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:11.954
I was in the kitchen.
I was helping Aunt May.


280
00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.270
Hi!

281
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.551
What's... It still
doesn't even seem real.


282
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:20.398
I know. I know.

283
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:22.831
How was your trip?

284
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.914
Good. Good.

285
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:27.071
How's school?

286
00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:31.160
Good. I may have
to sit out next semester...


287
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.675
What? What are you
talking about?


288
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.831
No. It's expensive.

289
00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:35.753
Who's that making
all that noise out here?


290
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:37.554
Part-time job. I'll be okay.
Okay.


291
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.076
Hey, Daddy!

292
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.710
How are you?

293
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:41.837
God!

294
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.278
A lot better now that
my little baby girl's here.


295
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.478
How are you really?

296
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:48.591
Um...

297
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.355
It's Christmas.

298
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:54.396
I miss you.

299
00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.879
Somebody else is here.

300
00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.193
Guess who? Hi! Daddy!

301
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.635
Hey! Look at you!

302
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.191
Look at you!

303
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.271
God!

304
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.875
Sonya!

305
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.635
Cheryl, I missed you.

306
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:17.552
You look amazing!
Politics agrees with you.


307
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:18.870
Thank you!

308
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:20.831
Hey!

309
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.357
Rachel!

310
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.761
Hi, Cheryl.

311
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.753
Wait. Who is that?
Lonnie!


312
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.516
Hey, Lonnie.

313
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.161
Merry Christmas, everybody!

314
00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:36.156
Good to be here!

315
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:38.471
Uh-oh. I got a little
something for you.


316
00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:41.360
How about an early
Christmas gift for everybody.


317
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.353
Lonnie, nobody
wants that right now.


318
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.761
Everybody wants it. Come on.

319
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.036
Here you go. One for you.

320
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:48.046
You get one, and you're going
to appreciate that one.


321
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.286
What is this?
One for you.


322
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:50.391
You have hair!

323
00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:51.710
Of course I had hair in '93.

324
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.071
Hey, that's going to be
very valuable one day.


325
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.646
I'm telling you, if something happens
to me, something happens to you!


326
00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.195
In a good way,
if you know what I mean.


327
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.075
So, hold on to it.

328
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:03.313
Walter, I'm so hungry. I've been traveling.
Right, baby? Oh!


329
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.606
Anything in the kitchen to eat?

330
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:06.473
Aunt May's putting
something together to eat.


331
00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.757
Why does that sound like
a terrorist threat to me?


332
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:11.879
Say another damn thing, Lonnie!
Your ass is whooped in here tonight!


333
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.606
I'm going to make sure these
two don't kill each other.


334
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:15.917
Granddad! Can we please
turn on rooftop Santa?


335
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:17.480
When are we going to turn it on?

336
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.680
I'm sorry, buddy, but I couldn't
get it to work this year.


337
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:26.433
Oh! You know, when I left the
league, I dabbled in electronics.


338
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:27.511
You know what that means?

339
00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:31.034
That means I'm going to have
that Santa working in no time.


340
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:32.111
Ding, ding, ding!

341
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:34.155
Thanks, Uncle Lonnie!

342
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.718
Uncle Lonnie's going
to fix rooftop Santa!


343
00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.315
You worked
two weeks at Best Buy.


344
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:41.036
You're right.
But I worked like a dog!


345
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.876
If I do my math right, that's
like 14 weeks in dog years.


346
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:46.554
I left that place barking.

347
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:48.792
They will never forget
Lonnie Maclay.


348
00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.481
Uh-oh! Auntie May,
I smell that food.


349
00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:52.881
Uh-oh. Wait a minute.

350
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.311
I'm in the bathroom!

351
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.394
He's a regular Renaissance man.
You should be so proud.


352
00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:02.793
Well, why don't you all
get settled in?


353
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:05.874
I have to run down to the shelter.
I'll be back in a minute.


354
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.326
Do you want me
to come with you, Daddy?


355
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.193
No, no, no.
Yeah, no. I'll come.


356
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.479
No, no, no.
You two, you connect up.


357
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:14.957
You haven't seen each other,
I don't know when.


358
00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.680
I'll be back, okay?

359
00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.595
Love you both.

360
00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:23.871
Walter?

361
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:26.314
Hi!

362
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.677
Oh. Good.

363
00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.078
My goodness!
It's so good to have you here.


364
00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:33.150
Oh, boy.

365
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.080
Christmas would not be
Christmas without you.


366
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.551
And my Grace, you couldn't
drag her away from here.


367
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.041
Remember when
the lights went out?


368
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:46.111
Yeah, the lights went out. You
know I'm scared of the dark.


369
00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.272
We tried to find
candles everywhere.


370
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.715
Everything.

371
00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:52.920
I'm telling you, you and Grace
were my best friends.


372
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:55.038
I know.
I've missed you guys so much.


373
00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.436
Thank you so much.
Thank you.


374
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.557
Hey, Walter.
All right.


375
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:00.793
Thank you. I have something for you.
Okay.


376
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:02.601
I do.

377
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.672
Grace had it framed

378
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:07.321
and she didn't have a chance
to give it to you.


379
00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:10.633
Who knew her sweet heart
would give out so suddenly?


380
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:16.397
She's so beautiful.

381
00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:17.837
I'll be right back.

382
00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.355
All right.

383
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:22.036
Hi, kids! Don't forget, we have
finger painting later today.


384
00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:23.111
Wow.

385
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:25.998
You sure are fine, girl.

386
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.712
I don't look that bad either.

387
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.806
Sorry it took so long for dinner.
I hope y'all ready.


388
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.846
I figured y'all would be hungry
from all that traveling,


389
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:44.366
so I put a little something
together for y'all.


390
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:46.472
You shouldn't have.

391
00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:48.366
You didn't have to go through
all that trouble, Aunt May.


392
00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:51.473
Baby, this is no trouble at all.
Now y'all are my family.


393
00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:52.951
And this right here,

394
00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:57.433
this is my spiced mung bean
winter casserole.


395
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.752
Got that from Ike
and Tina Turner, 1972.


396
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.356
And right here,

397
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:06.641
this is my Korean dry, squid
salad with authentic kimchi.


398
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:10.237
Mick Jagger, 1983.
That was a special tour.


399
00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:13.076
This looks like
all the ingredients to vomit.


400
00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:15.801
And this here is Aunt May's
prized possession, baby.


401
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.321
I put my foot in this.

402
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.200
This is my potato salad
from Poland.


403
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.399
Pickled fish, duck sausage
with mayonnaise.


404
00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:24.960
And to wash it all down,

405
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:28.916
some milk tea
with boiled tapioca balls.


406
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:31.072
Little Richard gave me
that one. Yes!


407
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:34.111
Who wants pizza?
Me!


408
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:35.191
I do!
Extra sausage.


409
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:36.566
- Pepperoni!
- We like thick crust.


410
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:38.126
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Thick crust.


411
00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:39.231
Hey! Wait a minute.

412
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:43.201
Your Aunt May went through a lot
of trouble preparing all this.


413
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:44.317
Yes, I did.

414
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:46.757
The least we could do

415
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.152
is to eat her...

416
00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:52.677
What's this?

417
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:53.750
Thank you, Walter.

418
00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.235
Because this right here, baby,

419
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:59.679
this is my spiced mung bean
winter casserole


420
00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:00.791
with a hint of...

421
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:01.871
Spam.

422
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.554
Limburger cheese.
Baby lotion?


423
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.076
You all remind my ass
when to laugh, okay?


424
00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:09.120
Aunt May, this looks
like a million bucks.


425
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.191
Thank you, baby.

426
00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:12.398
And Cameron is going to be
the first one to try it.


427
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.076
Wait! Why do I have to eat it?
I didn't do anything wrong!


428
00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:16.446
Don't talk back
to your mother, boy.


429
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:17.596
Why can't you eat it?

430
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:18.766
Don't talk back to your daddy.

431
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.792
Y'all are all going
to owe me a huge apology.


432
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:22.076
Here we go.

433
00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:24.551
Just a little taste
to kick off the celebration.


434
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.630
I don't want to die.

435
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:26.956
Open your mouth.

436
00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:30.557
Here, hold his nose. Hold his
nose so he opens his mouth.


437
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:32.394
Be a man now.
Hold his nose!


438
00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:34.512
Open! Okay.
Open up. Get it in.


439
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.240
There you go.
Seal it!


440
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:37.795
- Chew it!
- Cameron, are you okay?


441
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:39.440
You ungrateful bastards!

442
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:40.796
The whole lot of you!

443
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:42.966
Now I'm in there slaving my ass
off trying to make it right.


444
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:46.073
You think his ass upset right now? Wait
till he finds out you not his daddy.


445
00:24:46.150 --> 00:24:47.151
Aunt May!
Aunt May!


446
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:49.756
It's not that we wouldn't like it.
We just don't recognize it.


447
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:50.991
Kiss my ass.

448
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:52.720
Put it on a plate then.

449
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.766
And I guarantee you it's better
than this food on this table.


450
00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:56.440
And I don't know
where your ass been at.


451
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:57.557
Lonnie.

452
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:59.871
Am I wrong?

453
00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:01.191
I'm sorry, Walter.

454
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.510
Look, well, at least
there's bread.


455
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:05.846
Here, baby, have some bread.
Here, have some bread.


456
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.526
Baby, you know, Brooks has
got me on a meal plan.


457
00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.631
Mommy!

458
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:09.766
It doesn't look good in here.

459
00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:10.837
It's a low-carb...

460
00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:15.472
Daddy, Aunt May doesn't think she's actually
cooking Christmas dinner, does she?


461
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.961
With any luck, she's not.

462
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:20.477
Grace always believed in
everybody pitching in.


463
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:22.471
Grandma let me snap the peas.

464
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.473
She did, she did.

465
00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:26.200
She used to make me
clean a tub of greens.


466
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:29.353
She would be like, "Rachel, make sure
you get those bugs out them greens."


467
00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:30.477
Yeah.

468
00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:34.111
Somehow I always ended up having a
ton of bugs in my greens anyway.


469
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.353
But you barreled through. Didn't you?
Didn't let that stop you.


470
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.955
Extra protein.
Yeah.


471
00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:43.036
Remember after I got married, Mom
finally let me make the stuffing?


472
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.760
That obviously didn't work out.

473
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:45.991
Okay, really?

474
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.311
I was talking
about the dressing.


475
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:50.233
You cannot help yourself,
and it is baffling.


476
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.358
We were talking about our mother

477
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.046
and somehow you made it
about my marriage.


478
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:57.040
I wasn't talking about your marriage.
I was talking about your divorce.


479
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.630
At least I was smart enough
to get one.


480
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.674
Smartness! Hey, I'm still in the room.
Okay? Girls!


481
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:04.401
88's in the house!

482
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:08.236
Are y'all fighting already?

483
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.686
Niya, pack your stuff.
We're going to a hotel.


484
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.366
A hotel? A hostel, hotel,
it's the same thing.


485
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:12.566
Girls! It'll be an adventure.
Come on.


486
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:14.240
Don't waste a bus pass
on my account.


487
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:16.886
Pack your bags, Lonnie.
Hey, Rachel! That's called karma.


488
00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.151
We're getting the hell out of here.
Hey, Rachel! Cheryl!


489
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:20.996
Here we go.

490
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:22.959
You two. Get down here now!

491
00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.686
What's wrong with you two?
I didn't start this, Daddy.


492
00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:27.806
Oh, my God! You always start it.
Actually, you both started it.


493
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:29.710
You stay out of it.
You're just making it worse.


494
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:31.752
I'm makin'...
Okay. I'm Lonnie, now.


495
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:33.992
This is exactly why I wanted
to stay in a hotel, Pop.


496
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.206
Well, what's stopping you
now, huh?


497
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:36.470
Nothing's stopping me.

498
00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.832
Quiet! Quiet! Hey, quiet!

499
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:48.790
What would your mother say if she could
see you carrying on like this, huh?


500
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:51.836
Five days.

501
00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.631
Just five days for you all
to act like a family.


502
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:02.475
To act like you have the good
sense you were raised with.


503
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:07.031
Five days so we can make it
through Christmas.


504
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.191
That's all I'm asking.

505
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:10.600
Can you do that? Huh?

506
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.070
Love you, Pops.

507
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.152
You gotta hug me back.
I need it. There it is!


508
00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:37.598
You all should feel
like a bunch of dumbasses.


509
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:40.753
No, Aunt May, I came here with
the purest of intentions.


510
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:42.474
You are just
straight up delusional!


511
00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.040
Shut up!
You're the one being stupid!


512
00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.191
Shut up!

513
00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:48.001
Now just shut the shit up!
I'm sick of it.


514
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.118
Your daddy too damn old
for all this bullshit.


515
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.526
Now if y'all don't get your asses in
that kitchen and apologize right now,


516
00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:56.201
I'm kicking everybody's ass
in here. Come on.


517
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.431
Well, I just walked in.

518
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:58.841
Boy, listen here.

519
00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:02.471
Your little ass got on them red Bozo shoes.
That's why you gotta apologize.


520
00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:03.915
Get your asses in the kitchen.

521
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:07.806
Y'all need to get yourselves together
so we can go to church tomorrow.


522
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.879
Look at this.
Look at this young shit, here.


523
00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:13.159
Push a bitch again!

524
00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:16.074
Push a bitch again!
God damn it!


525
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:18.631
Y'all gotta go to church
tomorrow. You get there early.


526
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.077
Lonnie, get your ass
away from me.


527
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.914
This don't make no sense.

528
00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:26.272
They're just going
to blow my buzz.


529
00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.277
We're not going to make it
to Christmas, are we?


530
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.193
Huh! Not a damn chance.

531
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.590
<i>That's some good liquor
right there, baby.</i>


532
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:39.550
And the award for the most
outstanding performance


533
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.480
on offense, defense,
and special teams


534
00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:45.156
for the Sportsman
of the Universe...


535
00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:47.432
I'm talking
for the entire millennium.


536
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:50.912
Ladies and gentlemen,
number 88, Evan Meyers!


537
00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:54.437
Is it...

538
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:57.080
I can't...

539
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.436
You guys are so kind.
My gosh! Thank you!


540
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:08.117
You know what I mean.
That's just how I do.


541
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:31.037
Uncle Evan, Granddad said hurry
up. We're going to be late for church.


542
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.839
All right, Cam. I'm coming.

543
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:11.714
<i>God, you're holy Yes, you are</i>

544
00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:14.236
<i>God, you're worthy Yes, you are</i>

545
00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:15.994
<i>We give you our praise</i>

546
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:21.631
Now, you know not one of us has been
to church since we left Birmingham.


547
00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:23.806
And now we're just supposed to
come in here and act like...


548
00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:25.320
We anointed!

549
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.119
Praise Him!
Hallelujah!


550
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.476
How are you?

551
00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:29.790
<i>Yes, you are Yes, you are</i>

552
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.838
<i>Yes, you are Yes, you are</i>

553
00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:33.992
<i>Yes, you are Yes, you are</i>

554
00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:43.354
"Unto us a child is born.

555
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:47.074
"Unto us, a son is given.

556
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.037
"And his name

557
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.158
"shall be called Wonderful."

558
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.874
Wonderful!

559
00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:55.634
Before we get started
this morning,


560
00:30:55.710 --> 00:31:00.750
I want to welcome all of our
visitors and our CME Christians.


561
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:03.640
They only make it on Christmas,
Mother's Day, and Easter.


562
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:10.032
Also, want to recognize
one of our longest serving


563
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.317
and dearest brothers in Christ,

564
00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:16.475
Brother Walter Meyers, here
with his beautiful family.


565
00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.120
Lonnie! Lonnie!

566
00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.041
Let's not make it about me.
This is about Jesus.


567
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.433
Stop it. Sit down.

568
00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:32.318
Now we haven't seen
Brother Meyers for a while


569
00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:35.360
since the passing
of our dearest Grace.


570
00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:36.670
You all right, son?

571
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.406
If you're in the
neighborhood... Yeah.


572
00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.114
Stop on by and say hello.
Okay.


573
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.192
I'm sure he would
welcome the company.


574
00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.271
Amen.

575
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:44.431
Amen.

576
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:48.481
Amen.

577
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:52.555
Uncle Lonnie, are we still going
to fix rooftop Santa tonight?


578
00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:54.394
Has Uncle Lonnie
ever let you down?


579
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.116
Yes!
Yes!


580
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.515
Lonnie, don't you think
you should wait for Evan?


581
00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.598
Hey, I'm doing it for the kids!

582
00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:02.796
Your kids!

583
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:06.751
My hands are going up your ass.
Ain't got no gloves or nothing.


584
00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:10.001
Last time a man gave you a
prostate exam with no gloves on?


585
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.721
I really don't think you should be
messing around in there, Lonnie.


586
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:15.236
Don't listen to the Grinch,
okay? I got this.


587
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.914
Uncle Lonnie got this for you!

588
00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:18.640
Are you kids ready for Santa?

589
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:20.201
Yeah!
Yeah!


590
00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.479
I said, who's ready for Santa?

591
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:25.120
We are!
We are!


592
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:26.286
I'm going to make you an icepack

593
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:28.916
for the knot that's going to
be on your head when you fall.


594
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:31.206
Come on, give it up for the Grinch.
Give it up for the Grinch.


595
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:34.040
Cut that out! It's freezing out here.
Let's get in the house!


596
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:36.511
Auntie, please. Can we stay
for just a little bit longer?


597
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.314
Please, Mommy?

598
00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:41.111
All right.

599
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.356
But the minute he's done,
you come inside, okay?


600
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.512
Okay, Mommy.
Okay, bunny.


601
00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.601
Okay.

602
00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:52.876
Careful, Lonnie!

603
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.156
Whatever.

604
00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.316
I got this. Uncle Lonnie
got this for you, okay?


605
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.960
Uncle Lonnie said
he would do it...


606
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.991
Ooh!

607
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:05.678
Get out! Ow! Ow!

608
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:07.311
Whoo!

609
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:10.192
I got a little buzz
on my finger that time.


610
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.638
Does Uncle Lonnie know
what he's doing?


611
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:13.757
No.

612
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:17.113
<i>Ho! Ho! Ho! 
Merry Christmas!</i>

613
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:18.430
It's working!

614
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:19.871
He actually got it!

615
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:20.951
Great job, Uncle Lonnie.

616
00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:22.111
Who's the man?

617
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:23.635
Uncle Lonnie!

618
00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.070
That's what it's all about!

619
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.157
Ding, ding, ding-
Ding, ding, ding-


620
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:30.951
Good job, Uncle Lonnie!

621
00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.158
Good job! You actually did it!

622
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:35.961
I did not let the Grinches
ruin Christmas for you.


623
00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:37.555
Uncle Lonnie!
Uncle Lonnie!


624
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.597
That's not good.

625
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:42.717
Oh! Shit!

626
00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:47.437
Shit!

627
00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:53.397
Oh, shit!

628
00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:56.390
<i>Ho-ho-ho!</i>

629
00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:59.194
Uncle Lonnie killed Santa!

630
00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:01.834
- Hold it! Hold it!
- Mommy!


631
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.799
Did you get that?
I just posted it.


632
00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:04.910
- Good.
- Mommy!


633
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:07.840
Don't tell Cheryl.
Do not tell Cheryl, okay?


634
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:09.400
Uncle Lonnie has it, okay?

635
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.160
Shit!
My gosh!


636
00:34:12.070 --> 00:34:13.231
Shit!

637
00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.080
Is he still breathing?

638
00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:26.433
We should take a selfie.

639
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:31.396
Don't tell Cheryl.

640
00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:55.151
Hmm.

641
00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.111
You could tell me
where the tin is.


642
00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:06.720
Thought I heard somebody
down here.


643
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.679
Hey, sweetheart.
Hey.


644
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:09.791
<i>HEY-</i>

645
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:14.080
God, she had the best smile.

646
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:17.791
Yeah, she had the best everything.

647
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:22.314
It's good to have you
home. Yeah.


648
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.791
I wish you and Cheryl
were getting along better.


649
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:25.996
Yeah.

650
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:27.835
Been that way
since we were kids.


651
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:32.120
I don't know, I mean, I guess even in
family sometimes people just don't fit.


652
00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.590
You should have seen how I used
to fight with my big brother.


653
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.486
I know you're not trying to make
Mom's sweet potato pie, are you?


654
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:43.673
There's never been a Meyers
Christmas without it.


655
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:45.758
And if I'm going to make it,

656
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:48.681
I'm going to make it right.

657
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:55.046
<i>The top five in the
draft were supposed to be</i> a <i>lock.</i>


658
00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.232
<i>However, now that doctors
have cleared Evan Meyers</i>


659
00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:58.526
<i>to play in
the upcoming bowl game,</i>


660
00:35:58.550 --> 00:36:01.360
<i>that changes everything, everybody.
That changes everything!</i>


661
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:04.274
<i>He may be naughty, but the
boy's game is real nice.</i>


662
00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:06.114
Poetic injustice, good morning.

663
00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:09.114
Look. It's the accident child
in his natural habitat.


664
00:36:10.070 --> 00:36:12.721
He's unfunny and, therefore,
a liability to the pride.


665
00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:16.075
It's a shame, he won't make it.

666
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:17.750
I was not an accident.

667
00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:21.516
Everyone has their fourth child
in their 50s. That's common.


668
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.486
<i>You better not
shrink from the spotlight.</i>


669
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.319
<i>Merry Christmas, young man.</i>

670
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:26.876
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

671
00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:36.671
Hey. Evan.

672
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.155
You locked me out.
What?


673
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.561
You locked me out!

674
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.120
What? I can't hear you.
What happened?


675
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.316
Evan, quit playing.

676
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:45.472
I am freezing out here,
and I'm in my underwear.


677
00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:47.992
Oh! I'm sorry.
It must have been an accident.


678
00:36:48.070 --> 00:36:52.155
Evan. Evan!
I'm melting!


679
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:53.994
Evan! Evan!

680
00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:59.199
Happy Kwanzaa, Mrs. Olakanday.

681
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:00.591
Mmm-hmm.

682
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:03.800
Evan! Evan! Evan!

683
00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:07.591
Okay.

684
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:28.271
Oh!

685
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.351
No!

686
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:31.432
Evan, come on. Evan?

687
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:35.560
Come on. Evan? Evan! I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


688
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.201
You're not an accident.
Evan, don't be like this.


689
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:40.716
Don't be like this.
God does not like ugly, Evan.


690
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:42.030
Evan, please.

691
00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:44.556
Please, please. Come on!

692
00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.517
Twigs. You need some help?

693
00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.671
No, I'm fine.

694
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:54.033
Is there a reason you have a
tattoo that says "sesame chicken"?


695
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:55.606
It does not say
"sesame chicken," okay?


696
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:56.670
If you were more cultured,

697
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:58.830
you would know that it says
"Unbreakable" in Mandarin.


698
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:01.919
Well, I actually took Mandarin
for a semester in college,


699
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:03.913
I'm pretty sure it says
"sesame chicken."


700
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:05.401
Stop looking at my ass.

701
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:07.472
You know what? You're right.

702
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:08.996
You got it.

703
00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.233
I think it says, "Free fortune
cookie with delivery."


704
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:14.790
Really?

705
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:16.126
Let me try to get you
out of here.


706
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:18.312
No! No, no, no.

707
00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:20.766
It's not that kind of party! Okay?
It's not that kind of party.


708
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.157
Let me use two hands. I just...
Get from behind me!


709
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.119
No! No!

710
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.157
Get... Get from behind me! No!
Just...


711
00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:33.398
Hold on.
Back up off of my butt!


712
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.833
No! No! No!

713
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.596
There you go.

714
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.274
You okay?
Yeah. I'm good.


715
00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:40.875
What's wrong with you?
I'm good. Okay?


716
00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.036
I got it.

717
00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:46.591
You Okay?

718
00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.319
Evan, I'm going to kill you!

719
00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:57.239
Phew! Everybody
got everything?


720
00:38:57.310 --> 00:38:58.391
Hey, Mom.
Hey.


721
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:59.551
Hey, Aunt Rachel.

722
00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:01.234
Look who's up!
How was your morning?


723
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:02.311
Don't ask.

724
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:03.915
Hey, baby girl.
Hey.


725
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.475
We got a lot of food.

726
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.040
I see this.

727
00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:10.080
I swear, if I close my eyes,

728
00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:13.034
I can almost see her in here
like it was yesterday.


729
00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:15.511
The thought of having Christmas
dinner without her...


730
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:17.326
Thought of cooking Christmas
dinner without her...


731
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:19.239
She was a great cook.

732
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:20.880
Guess it runs in the family.

733
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:23.356
You need a cough drop, baby?

734
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.792
It's a shame
we can't find her recipes.


735
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:27.799
- Where are they?
- Who knows?


736
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:30.231
She stashed them in a tin
around here somewhere.


737
00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:31.311
That's right.
You know,


738
00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:35.031
I saw her make those recipes a
million times. I should know them.


739
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:38.310
I just always thought
she'd be here.


740
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:39.681
She is here.

741
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:43.597
She's in every pot,
in every pan, every cabinet,


742
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.675
and every drawer.

743
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:48.754
We are all standing
on holy ground.


744
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.481
This is the Church of Grace.

745
00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:55.834
Y'all didn't hear me?
This is the Church of Grace!


746
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:58.356
Hallelujah!

747
00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:00.637
In the Church of Grace,
we need music.


748
00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.046
Let's get that music, Miss Niya.
Thank you, Jesus!


749
00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.070
Let's do it!

750
00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:05.839
Put your music on, Miss Niya.
Here we go.


751
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:07.600
Let's see what
you gonna work with.


752
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:12.200
This is not church dancing!

753
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:14.272
Don't you get down!
Don't you get down!


754
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:15.871
Come on, Mom.

755
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.271
Give it to 'em.
Show 'em what you got.


756
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:21.086
All right, Aunt May. Show Aunt
May what you're working with.


757
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:22.510
What do y'all know
about this stuff?


758
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:26.640
You got my jam!

759
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:31.994
Sonya, you better get your
titties off my back, girl,


760
00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.879
with your non-dancing ass!

761
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:35.031
Right here.

762
00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:36.316
Cheryl! Cheryl!
Do our routine!


763
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:39.155
Wait, let me get my shoes off!

764
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.554
That's it!
Okay, that's enough of that.


765
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:47.836
We got it.

766
00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.475
What? What?

767
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:52.076
Let Aunt May play
some real music.


768
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:55.841
Okay, there go mine.
Remember that? Remember that?


769
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:58.246
Remember, Aunt May taught y'all
that when y'all was little girls?


770
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.113
Remember that? Come on.
What you got?


771
00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.072
Bring it back. Bring it back.
Now take it low.


772
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:04.914
What? What? Now pop that.

773
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.401
All right.
I'm doing second round.


774
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:08.319
- Come on. Come on.
- Here we go.


775
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:10.040
Now, take it back. Come on.

776
00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.112
Bring it back. Come on.
Pump that.


777
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:15.911
Remember? Step! Bring it up.

778
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.235
Here it goes!

779
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.596
There it goes!

780
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:23.320
Now, take it back!

781
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:24.596
Come on, Aunt May.

782
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:28.840
Wait, Aunt May,
you been drinking again?


783
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:30.526
Join us, Pop-pop.
You gotta move it.


784
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.756
Daddy, Daddy!

785
00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.197
Come on, Walter.
Bring your old ass in here.


786
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:40.030
Go, Daddy. Go, Daddy.
Go, Daddy.


787
00:41:44.510 --> 00:41:46.239
Get 'em, Pop! Show 'em!

788
00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.559
Push, Lonnie. Dang!

789
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:50.200
Push with your legs.

790
00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:52.476
Y'all did it.

791
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.599
That's the biggest tree
I've ever seen.


792
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:56.796
We've had bigger, sweetie.

793
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:57.917
Yeah!

794
00:41:57.990 --> 00:42:00.152
Like the year Mom
let Evan pick the tree.


795
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:04.473
It was so big we had to saw off the
top just to get it in the house.


796
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:06.552
What did you do with
the other half you sawed off?


797
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:09.554
We stood it up next to the bigger half.
We had two trees that year.


798
00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.075
You're welcome, by the way.

799
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:14.199
Like your mother always said,
"The bigger the tree..."


800
00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:16.074
"The bigger the love!"

801
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:20.231
Man.

802
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:23.191
Yeah.

803
00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:28.676
Look here. I'm going to go into the
garage and get the ornaments. Okay?


804
00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:29.831
You need some help, Daddy?

805
00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:32.595
I'm all right, sweetie.
All right.


806
00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:34.406
All right, y'all. Well, let's
bring this thing to life.


807
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:36.046
Yes. Christian, go get
some water for the tree.


808
00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:38.914
I can't. I gotta go meet
Brooks in town square.


809
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:41.715
Well, the kids would love to go
to town square and meet Santa.


810
00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.838
Come on, y'all. Let's do this.
All right, have fun.


811
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:46.366
All right, Evan, baby. Get a broom
so we can get up these pine needles.


812
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:48.566
I can't. I told Eric that I'ma
hang with him for a little bit.


813
00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:50.035
But you love
decorating the tree.


814
00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.875
I know. But when y'all
mess up, then I get to fix it.


815
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:54.726
Don't be chasing
them fast-ass girls.


816
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:56.673
- Nah. Bye, y'all.
- Be careful, baby.


817
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.206
Now, Rachel and Cheryl,
do y'all think


818
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:59.806
y'all can go in the kitchen
and put something together?


819
00:42:59.830 --> 00:43:01.246
Some snacks,
without killing each other?


820
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:02.396
Yes.
I appreciate that.


821
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.310
Y'all go on and be
big girls for Aunt May.


822
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.071
Depending on y'all.

823
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:08.606
And, Lonnie, I'm going to need you
to get me the dustpan and the broom


824
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.046
so you can help me
get up these pine needles.


825
00:43:10.070 --> 00:43:12.118
Okay. We'll get 'em up.
Thank you.


826
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:14.551
But let me tell you something.
What?


827
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:16.712
I love how your hair
just drapes your face.


828
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:18.474
It just like...

829
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:19.881
You know, you feathered it.

830
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:23.477
And it's just so nice how it just, you
know, shapes your face real nice.


831
00:43:23.590 --> 00:43:25.606
Thank you, Lonnie. I appreciate that.
Take care of yourself.


832
00:43:25.630 --> 00:43:26.870
Thank you. Yes, indeed.

833
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:31.399
It's like you did a big-ass
peach and a big-ass wig


834
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:34.713
and you put that wig on top of that
peach, and you drape it the same way.


835
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:36.838
Lonnie, go on, boy.

836
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:39.366
I don't feel like you right now.
Get you on. All right, all right.


837
00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.119
Let me get that broom.
Get on!


838
00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:57.516
<i>Which tree do you think
we should take home, Evan?</i>


839
00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.830
This one?

840
00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:01.676
<i>I want this one, Mommy.</i>

841
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:04.594
<i>Perfect. Just like you.</i>

842
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:26.120
<i>Feliz Navidad!</i>

843
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:28.192
What up, fam?
Come on, Santa Claus!


844
00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:29.920
Time to go get
them ho, ho, ho's.


845
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:32.880
Good to see you, boy. You
always shining like a little...


846
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:34.600
God damn!
What's that? Soul Glo?


847
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:36.195
Man, beauty supply store.
Aisle two.


848
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.598
I'm up here way too high.
Hang on. There it is.


849
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.439
Hold up. Boy, you ain't cool enough.
What?


850
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.510
Come on, baby. You ain't
going to leave me behind.


851
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:45.126
Come on, now.
Who do you think taught you?


852
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:46.720
You ready?
I'm ready. Let's go.


853
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:48.086
Hold on, I'm gonna put
my seat belt on.


854
00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:49.206
Because we all know
you can't drive.


855
00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.154
Let's get it. You know
what I'm saying?


856
00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:55.646
Okay... Daddy!
Can we go see Santa, Daddy?


857
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:56.671
Huh?

858
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:58.240
Can we go see Santa?

859
00:44:58.310 --> 00:44:59.311
Santa?

860
00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:02.314
You know, 75% of all sidewalk
Santa's have Hepatitis C.


861
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:04.472
Don't put your fingers
in his beard.


862
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:06.917
Thank you for that
very fun fact, Brooks.


863
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:08.366
Look, baby, soon
as Daddy's done here,


864
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:10.286
I'm going to take you to do
whatever you want to do, okay?


865
00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:11.800
Like that's going to happen.

866
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:13.952
Come on. I'll take you. Okay.

867
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:15.520
He gets that from his mother.

868
00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:17.399
Let's take a walk.

869
00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:20.281
We just lost Van Kirk.
He's supporting Baxter.


870
00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:21.431
What?

871
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:25.240
Our biggest donor
just backed out? Wow.


872
00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.351
Politics.

873
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:27.636
Yeah, so what do we do now?

874
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:30.361
Well, the Brigham Group is
still looking for a way to...


875
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:31.477
Control our campaign.

876
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:32.550
No.
Yeah.


877
00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:33.671
To support you...
Not me.


878
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:35.446
Because they believe in
your vision to invest in you.


879
00:45:35.470 --> 00:45:38.646
No, what they believe in is that if we win,
they're the first in line for a favor.


880
00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:41.514
Their last favor
downsized a factory!


881
00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:44.474
1,500 people out of work! Their
last candidate is now a senator.


882
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:46.518
Andy Brooks, just, please.

883
00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:48.206
I'm an adult.
Just tell me what they want.


884
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:49.720
It's not even a done deal yet.

885
00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:51.918
We will talk more about this
after the interview.


886
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:53.636
What interview?

887
00:45:53.790 --> 00:45:57.511
<i>We are here with congressional
candidate Christian Meyers.</i>


888
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:59.046
<i>New poll numbers show...
Christian's on</i> TV!


889
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.326
<i>- That you really have</i>
a <i>good chance-</i> What?


890
00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:01.526
<i>Yeah, but we will not stop</i>

891
00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:02.910
<i>until the last vote is in.</i>
My <i>gosh!</i>


892
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:06.870
Politics aside, how are you enjoying being
home for the holidays with your family?


893
00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:09.317
Daddy! Daddy!
It's Christian! Hurry!


894
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:12.637
Hey! That's the tie
I bought him!


895
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.030
Move, Cheryl. Move!
Geez Louise!


896
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:15.566
<i>And the other highlight
is Santa Claus.</i>


897
00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:17.479
<i>Have you had a chance
to sit on his lap yet?</i>


898
00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:18.950
<i>No, I'm leaving that up
to the kids.</i>


899
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:21.393
If you did sit on Santa's lap,

900
00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:23.766
I'm sure everyone at home would love
to know what you would ask for.


901
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:25.519
Ask for a suit that fits.

902
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.566
Because he going to mess around
and get a yeast infection.


903
00:46:27.590 --> 00:46:29.606
May! And that cream
don't work on men, Cheryl.


904
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:31.041
You used to keep
a yeast infection.


905
00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:32.441
Aunt May!
That itching, burning...


906
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:34.239
It didn't do good for you.

907
00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:36.597
They ain't Instagram
models, but they a'ight.


908
00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:39.206
'Cause anytime you ask them to do
something, they gonna be like, "A'ight."


909
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.486
Put some gas in the car. "A'ight."
Pour my bath water. "A'ight."


910
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:43.194
I don't even take baths.
I take showers.


911
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:44.271
What can I get for you?

912
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:45.471
Everything.

913
00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:47.999
Can I get
the chili cheese bacon burger?


914
00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:49.521
And can I get some fries?

915
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:51.046
And can you please tell them
to make it crispy.


916
00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:53.766
I need to hear the
when I eat. You know what I'm saying?


917
00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:55.997
And can I get a milkshake?

918
00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:57.637
With extra whipped cream.

919
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:59.326
Because last time,
they forgot my whipped cream.


920
00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:01.006
So I'm going to need
my last time whipped cream


921
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.032
and this time whipped cream,
and some apple pie.


922
00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:04.600
Can I just get a chicken breast,

923
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:06.486
side of asparagus,
and some brown rice, please?


924
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:07.636
Absolutely.

925
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:09.399
Everything's coming right up, baby.
Okay.


926
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:11.279
All right, baby.
You got mine? Baby?


927
00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:14.797
Baby, baby, baby! I heard you

928
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:16.126
Obviously you didn't.
A bag of sugar.


929
00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:17.446
<i>A</i> bag of sugar.
Two sticks of butter.


930
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:18.926
<i>Two sticks of butter.
And some vanilla extract.</i>


931
00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:20.190
<i>Don't forget, Lonnie.</i>

932
00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.246
<i>And the vanilla wafers, and
bananas...</i> I'ma call <i>you</i> back.


933
00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:23.999
Call you back!

934
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:25.430
Let me give you
a hand with that.


935
00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:26.871
Oh! See that?

936
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:30.079
I'm used to putting my hands up like that.
Crashing the boards.


937
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:32.960
I know a little bit
about boxing out, myself.


938
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:34.953
Okay. You play basketball?

939
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:36.316
I did.

940
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:37.994
I did. What about you?

941
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:40.195
You know, a little bit.

942
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:42.591
Who hasn't?

943
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:45.081
Lonnie Maclay?

944
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:50.837
My dad is a huge
Seattle SuperSonics fan.


945
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:51.957
Wow.

946
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:54.271
I remember game four,

947
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.395
1991, game-winning shot.

948
00:47:57.470 --> 00:48:00.076
You remember?
You saw that game?


949
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:01.675
Did I?

950
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:04.151
We wore green
for like a week straight!


951
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.073
Wow.
Shatao!


952
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:09.073
Don't tell me you know
about "shatao."


953
00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:11.517
I know all about "shatao."

954
00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:13.351
Wow.

955
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:17.436
I don't think anyone's going to
believe that I actually met you.


956
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:19.274
Would you mind
if I take a selfie?


957
00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:22.354
If you know about "shatao," you can
take as many photos <i>as</i> you want.


958
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:23.431
Okay.

959
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.238
Love that!
Can we take another?


960
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:31.436
Funny face.
Okay.


961
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:33.239
All right, you ready? Okay.
Mmm-hmm.


962
00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:40.272
Love that!
Let me see.


963
00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:41.875
That's great!
Right?


964
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:44.191
You know what? I would love
a copy of that picture.


965
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:45.556
Yeah.

966
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.326
You want to put
your number in my phone?


967
00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:48.726
And I'll just send it
to you when I get off?


968
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.912
Okay, I'll put my number.
Okay, put it in.


969
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:52.480
My number in here.

970
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:56.398
I would love to put
this photo on my fan wall.


971
00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:58.871
Especially someone
as beautiful as you.


972
00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:00.791
That's me.

973
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:03.471
I got it.

974
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:05.795
So, I'll send it.

975
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:07.474
You better send it.

976
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:08.631
I will.

977
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:11.237
But you're not going
to get me fired. Okay.


978
00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:14.034
It's a pleasure
meeting you, Lonnie.


979
00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:15.246
<i>Attention, all shoppers.</i>

980
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:18.353
<i>Special holiday savings today
with your Clubs Card.</i>


981
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:20.432
Pleasure's all mine.

982
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:23.276
Twigs!

983
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:24.796
Twigs! Hold up!

984
00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:27.310
Cool!

985
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:29.313
Workout partner for the week.

986
00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:32.241
I missed the last three days.
Had to double up.


987
00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:33.550
How far do you usually run?

988
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:35.837
A lot farther when people
aren't talking to me.


989
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:38.675
Me, I love the company.
Helps the time go by.


990
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:40.519
I don't. It distracts me.

991
00:49:42.350 --> 00:49:44.751
Girl, I swear, you haven't
changed one bit.


992
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:48.671
Except for this jogging thing.

993
00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:50.195
Looks good on you.

994
00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.034
And neighborhood's looking good.

995
00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:54.590
I gotta say, your pops did a real
good job fixing up the house.


996
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:57.958
Okay, what part of "it's
distracting" don't you understand?


997
00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:01.916
Probably the same part of
"there's a cicada in your hair"


998
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:03.435
that you don't understand.

999
00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:07.919
Get it! Get it! Get it!

1000
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:09.151
Have a good rest of the day.

1001
00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:10.277
Get it! Get it! Get it!

1002
00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:13.680
Get it Off!

1003
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:18.553
Did you find everything
you need?


1004
00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:25.117
Sometimes you find things that
you're not even looking for.


1005
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:27.231
Crazy.

1006
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:30.155
I seen your interview, E.

1007
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:31.277
What interview?

1008
00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:32.431
The one on ESPN.

1009
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:34.390
They said your shoulder
was good. You all right?


1010
00:50:35.550 --> 00:50:36.881
Yeah.

1011
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:38.281
Coach is...

1012
00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:41.593
He's trying to get me to stay on these
pills for like another week or two.


1013
00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:45.275
I just forgot to get my
prescription filled before I left.


1014
00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:46.606
You think your boy
can get me some?


1015
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:48.553
Who? Lil' Discount?
Mmm-hmm.


1016
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:49.677
Man. He good.

1017
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:52.640
Got your suits, pills,
negative pregnancy results.


1018
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:54.752
Listen, the baby is not yours.

1019
00:50:56.430 --> 00:50:58.034
Ask him if he can get these.

1020
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.201
My man can do it all, bro.
I got you.


1021
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:04.510
I'ma to talk to him for you.

1022
00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:05.671
Thanks, man.

1023
00:51:06.310 --> 00:51:07.436
Oh, God.

1024
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:10.196
I found her!

1025
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:14.834
Hey!
Hey.


1026
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.481
Who's Munchie?

1027
00:51:26.110 --> 00:51:30.274
His name is Malachi, and we used
to be friends in high school.


1028
00:51:30.350 --> 00:51:32.310
Then why didn't you let him
help us with the bags?


1029
00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:35.001
Because first they help you
with your bags


1030
00:51:35.070 --> 00:51:37.486
and next thing you know, they're
taking somebody else to prom.


1031
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:40.241
Mom, can I tell you something?

1032
00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:41.875
And not get in trouble for it?

1033
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:43.631
What?

1034
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:45.480
Am I going to get in trouble?

1035
00:51:45.550 --> 00:51:46.551
Probably.

1036
00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:48.560
You're an attractive woman.

1037
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:52.271
You have a lot to offer a guy but
you gotta stop running them off.


1038
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:53.726
I'm not running anybody off.

1039
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:54.797
Really?

1040
00:51:55.110 --> 00:51:57.556
Remember my gym teacher, Mr.
Harrison? Yeah.


1041
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:59.871
He said you were beautiful.
He said he loved your hair.


1042
00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:02.874
And you said, "So if I was bald,
I wouldn't be beautiful?"


1043
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:07.274
No. See, I just don't think a woman's
beauty should be defined by her hair.


1044
00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:08.840
Well, what about
the gas station?


1045
00:52:08.910 --> 00:52:11.246
It was storming, and that really
cute guy asked to pump our gas.


1046
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:12.635
And I let him.

1047
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:13.791
Well, yeah.

1048
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:15.918
Until he hit regular unleaded,
and you said,


1049
00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:18.561
"So a black woman
can't afford premium?"


1050
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:19.630
Exactly.

1051
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.560
You had to pump your gas in the
rain while it ruined your hair.


1052
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:24.359
I was getting my hair done
the next day.


1053
00:52:24.430 --> 00:52:26.876
Mom, you're missing the point.

1054
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:28.520
Men aren't that smart.

1055
00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:30.950
So we have to trick them into
thinking things are their idea


1056
00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:32.116
when it's really ours.

1057
00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:33.246
Like Brandon, my boyfriend.

1058
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:34.351
I'm sorry.

1059
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:37.031
You have a boyfriend?

1060
00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:38.236
Mom, stay focused.

1061
00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:39.766
I don't like carrying
my bag all the time.


1062
00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:42.031
So when Brandon's around, I
act like it hurts my shoulder


1063
00:52:42.110 --> 00:52:43.350
and he carries it for me.

1064
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:45.486
He gets to be a hero, and I
don't have to carry my bag.


1065
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:46.670
When did you get a boyfriend?

1066
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:48.395
Focus, Mom.

1067
00:52:49.110 --> 00:52:50.111
Trust me.

1068
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:53.911
Life's a whole lot easier when there's
someone to help carry the load.


1069
00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:56.718
Even if you can
carry it yourself.


1070
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:07.246
People want jobs, and
small businesses want capital.


1071
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:09.166
It's not enough to create
centers for small businesses.


1072
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:10.954
We have to pool...

1073
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:13.761
We have to cultivate resources.

1074
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:16.601
Pop. Hey, morning! Morning!
Morning!


1075
00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:18.366
I'm gonna whip up some pancakes here.
You want some?


1076
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:21.758
No, I'm trying to lay off them
processed carbs right now.


1077
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:23.356
Yeah.

1078
00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:30.752
I cannot tell you how excited we
were watching you on TV yesterday.


1079
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:35.118
You know, it's not often

1080
00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:42.154
the son of an old mechanic becomes
a United States congressman.


1081
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:44.995
You own six auto shops, Pop.

1082
00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:46.913
And I do have
to win the election first.


1083
00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:48.754
It's only a formality.

1084
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:52.274
Hey, your mother...

1085
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:58.755
She would have turned this whole house
into your campaign headquarters.


1086
00:53:58.830 --> 00:53:59.956
Yep-

1087
00:54:00.830 --> 00:54:02.878
She'd have been so proud of you.

1088
00:54:06.590 --> 00:54:09.560
You know, maybe you can say a few
words at the shelter this year.


1089
00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:11.678
I mean, hearing
from a future congressman


1090
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:15.319
would make the year
even more special.


1091
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:20.281
I'd love to.

1092
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:23.271
Hey!

1093
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:25.954
Oh! Buddy.

1094
00:54:27.750 --> 00:54:29.798
You ain't worried about me
embarrassing you?


1095
00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:33.321
Whoo! Here we go.

1096
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:36.678
I thought we supposed
to be playing some football.


1097
00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:38.599
Come on, old man. Let's go!

1098
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:41.633
Who you talking to?

1099
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:43.951
Hey. Come on, old man.

1100
00:54:44.630 --> 00:54:45.791
Hut! Hike!

1101
00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:49.151
Here I come!

1102
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:52.560
Get him, son. Get him!

1103
00:54:53.310 --> 00:54:55.995
This is great.
Quality family time.


1104
00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:58.596
A beautiful day. Beautiful day.
Yes, it is.


1105
00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.240
They gonna kill
each other out there.


1106
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:03.994
- Block!
- Look at the old man!


1107
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:06.600
Here! Right here!
Throw the ball!


1108
00:55:06.670 --> 00:55:08.166
- Lonnie, heads up!
- Nice catch, Lonnie.


1109
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:10.272
That's how
they did it in Croatia.


1110
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:12.239
What's up with those
pink pants, Malibu Barbie?


1111
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:13.686
I left mine at home.
These are Cheryl's.


1112
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:15.439
Yeah. No, we all believe that.

1113
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:20.911
I'm down.

1114
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:22.191
First down for me.
It's touch!


1115
00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:24.398
Get off my sister, man.
I got you.


1116
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:25.796
I was down, Lonnie!

1117
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:31.680
Cheryl, that's how you do it.

1118
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:34.111
Whoo!
What are y'all doing?


1119
00:55:34.190 --> 00:55:37.160
I taught you that!
I taught you that, baby.


1120
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:38.914
We got skills over here.

1121
00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:40.790
Hey, Aunt May.

1122
00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:43.717
That's for you, baby.
She don't want you!


1123
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:46.272
Uh-oh!
Somebody got a boyfriend!


1124
00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:49.599
They'd make an excellent couple.

1125
00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:52.719
I got vibrators
older than that child.


1126
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:57.238
Go, baby! Go, baby!

1127
00:55:57.390 --> 00:55:58.835
Rachel, stop trying to pump him.

1128
00:55:58.990 --> 00:56:00.992
What's all this freaking
going on? Come on!


1129
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:02.680
What are you doing?

1130
00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:04.639
Cameron, don't you want to play?

1131
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:07.714
Is it better to be
on the team or own it?


1132
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:11.231
Where's the flag?

1133
00:56:11.310 --> 00:56:12.686
Get your ass up, boy.
Come on. Get up, boy.


1134
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:14.041
Come on, Ev.
Damn!


1135
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:20.237
'Got it!

1136
00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.357
What was that, Lonnie?

1137
00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:22.920
Evan! Evan! Don't!

1138
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:24.966
What the hell was that? You tripped him!
What are you doing?


1139
00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:26.116
Lonnie, don't!

1140
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:28.713
World Star!

1141
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:30.679
Lonnie, have you lost your damn mind?
Lonnie!


1142
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:32.230
- Lonnie!
- Wait a minute!


1143
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:34.150
Man, you saw where I was going!

1144
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:35.680
You gonna try to trip me?
Stop it!


1145
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:37.195
You had to trip him?

1146
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:38.681
That's his career!

1147
00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:40.479
Not your dumb, made up one!

1148
00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:41.726
Really?
What's that, right there?


1149
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:43.354
What is that?
Everyone knows


1150
00:56:43.430 --> 00:56:45.637
you go overseas when you
don't make it in the NBA.


1151
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:46.996
You're a joke!

1152
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.676
Oh. At least he had a career,
Miss Teacher-Veterinarian.


1153
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:50.876
Or is it attorney now?

1154
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:52.998
Which, given the salary
of a divorced, single mom


1155
00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:55.198
working graveyard shifts
at the Waffle House,


1156
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:57.113
will take till 2050 to afford.

1157
00:56:57.190 --> 00:56:58.874
Rachel, Cheryl! Okay.

1158
00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:02.081
Okay, game's over!
Game's over.


1159
00:57:02.190 --> 00:57:04.955
Good game! Good game!
Good game! Yeah!


1160
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:06.714
Good game. Let's go get...

1161
00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:08.554
Let's go get dinner. Okay?

1162
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:10.632
As long as
it's not Waffle House.


1163
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:12.360
The hell is wrong with him?

1164
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:18.033
Go ahead. I got the baby.
Come on, babies.


1165
00:57:18.110 --> 00:57:19.794
I got y'all. Come on. Come on.

1166
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:25.801
We were doing so well.

1167
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:37.155
You were great, Mom.

1168
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:42.552
Yeah, man. I'm all right.
I almost whooped that...


1169
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:44.752
We almost whooped his ass.

1170
00:57:44.830 --> 00:57:46.116
Yo, you got that
for me, or what?


1171
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:47.715
Yeah, I got it.

1172
00:57:49.230 --> 00:57:50.311
Yes!

1173
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:52.034
Damn, man!
I didn't need this many!


1174
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:53.993
No, a couple of 'em SweeTARTS.

1175
00:57:57.590 --> 00:57:59.086
Come on, Christian.
Just hear me out.


1176
00:57:59.110 --> 00:58:02.239
This is exactly why I said I didn't
want them to back my campaign!


1177
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:05.075
They just blow into town and start
steamrolling over small businesses.


1178
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:07.950
No, they blow into town, and they
turn state senators into congressmen.


1179
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:10.391
This is not good!
I can't do this!


1180
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:11.686
I think you're
over thinking this.


1181
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:12.766
They're just going
to go downtown.


1182
00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:15.286
They're going to turn some old, shitty
buildings into beautiful lofts.


1183
00:58:15.310 --> 00:58:17.074
What's the problem?
My mom.


1184
00:58:17.390 --> 00:58:20.121
The homeless shelter
is in the district.


1185
00:58:20.190 --> 00:58:21.794
It meant a lot to my mom.

1186
00:58:24.550 --> 00:58:26.791
Look, after you're elected,

1187
00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.526
you're going to rebuild
that homeless shelter.


1188
00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:31.156
And it's going to be beautiful.
Your mother would love it.


1189
00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:33.073
Andy Brooks,

1190
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:35.994
no announcement
until after the holidays.


1191
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:42.031
Fine.

1192
00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:52.075
Hey, Lonnie.

1193
00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:55.073
Can I get some help in the back?

1194
00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:48.121
Hmm!

1195
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:50.120
No, you didn't.

1196
00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:53.351
Ooh!

1197
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:56.110
Sorry.

1198
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:02.191
Rachel.

1199
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:04.316
Rachel Meyers.

1200
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:05.710
Do we know each other?

1201
01:00:06.830 --> 01:00:08.832
Jasmine.
Chloe's little sister.


1202
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:10.839
From high school.

1203
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:12.958
Yeah, right!
Right. How is she?


1204
01:00:13.070 --> 01:00:15.641
She's good. She's coaching
women's basketball at Kansas.


1205
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:16.950
Nice!
Yeah.


1206
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.237
Wow! You look the same.

1207
01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:21.119
Like no time passed.

1208
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:22.277
How have you been?

1209
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:26.480
Seem to be blowing up
over there.


1210
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:28.151
Boyfriend?

1211
01:00:28.310 --> 01:00:29.311
Um...

1212
01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:34.281
He just invited me to Chicago
for the weekend.


1213
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.234
Must be nice.
$8.49.


1214
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:39.841
He can't get enough of you.

1215
01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:42.635
Do you mind?

1216
01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:44.121
He's so cute.

1217
01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:46.039
Look how perfect
we are together.


1218
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:47.836
Shit.

1219
01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:49.514
That's what I said.

1220
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:51.996
Want to see another?

1221
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:53.521
Um... Oh!

1222
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:57.720
Yeah. Confirmation
of your love.


1223
01:00:59.630 --> 01:01:02.156
I was hoping I wouldn't have
to spend Christmas alone.


1224
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:04.110
But he's got to take care
of his Grandma Cheryl.


1225
01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:06.551
She's really old.

1226
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:09.951
Yeah.

1227
01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:13.559
I had an old
Grandma Cheryl once.


1228
01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:15.553
She was a mean, old bitch.

1229
01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.317
You said you were going
to be alone on Christmas?


1230
01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:22.441
Yeah.

1231
01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:24.000
You don't have to be.

1232
01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:26.720
I don't?
Nope.


1233
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:30.151
Our family has
so much love to give.


1234
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:32.635
Obviously.

1235
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:34.075
That's what's up.

1236
01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:11.030
Some game, huh?

1237
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:14.511
Yeah.

1238
01:02:14.590 --> 01:02:16.672
Hey, don't worry
about what your sister said.


1239
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:17.831
Being single isn't bad.

1240
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:19.150
Thanks. Feel a lot better.

1241
01:02:19.590 --> 01:02:20.637
What is wrong with you?

1242
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:22.551
You know, nothing.

1243
01:02:22.630 --> 01:02:27.033
Except that you keep trying to act
like we're cool when we're not.


1244
01:02:27.790 --> 01:02:29.679
Why aren't we cool?
Really?


1245
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:34.035
Belinda "Big teeth"?

1246
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:35.157
Who?

1247
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:37.631
Your prom date? Horse face?

1248
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:40.991
Her teeth weren't really that big.
She had a small mouth.


1249
01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:43.006
And, okay, I took her to the prom.
What's the big problem?


1250
01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:44.606
You took her to the prom!
That's the problem.


1251
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:46.519
After you canceled on me
at the last minute.


1252
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:48.080
Like you even wanted
to go with me!


1253
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:49.834
Why do you think
I asked you to go?


1254
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:54.796
I heard him.

1255
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:56.720
Heard who?
Your dumb jock friend.


1256
01:02:56.790 --> 01:03:00.078
He was laughing about how easy it would
be for the star basketball player


1257
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:03.074
to take his nerdy next-door
neighbor to bed that night.


1258
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:05.391
I heard him. And you just
let him talk about me.


1259
01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:07.313
You didn't say anything!

1260
01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:11.356
You're right. I didn't.

1261
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:15.353
And neither did he
after I broke his nose.


1262
01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:18.994
That's how Damien
broke his nose?


1263
01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:21.914
You would have known if you weren't
such a dramatic little princess.


1264
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:25.119
You would have known why I canceled
if you weren't such a dumb jock.


1265
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:26.286
Wouldn't have mattered anyway

1266
01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:29.310
'cause there wouldn't have been enough
room in the limo for the three of us.


1267
01:03:29.350 --> 01:03:30.590
The three of us?
Yeah.


1268
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:32.081
Me, you, and your ego.

1269
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:34.239
Oh. We'd have fit.

1270
01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:36.910
Because your low self-esteem doesn't
take up too much real estate.


1271
01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:41.640
You know what?
I'm glad we didn't go.


1272
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:44.111
That makes two of us. It
would've been a terrible night.


1273
01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:45.271
Worst prom ever.

1274
01:03:45.350 --> 01:03:47.273
Absolute worst!

1275
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:04.519
It would have been
a horrible night.


1276
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:05.991
Awful.

1277
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:29.231
Ooh!

1278
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:33.670
Okay. Here.

1279
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:38.237
Aunt May, I gotta go
to the bathroom.


1280
01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:41.280
Hold it. Aunt May
is in concert, baby.


1281
01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:43.830
You don't interrupt
Aunt May's concerts.


1282
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:47.472
Just hold it
a little longer, Cam.


1283
01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:49.675
Is Cameron all right?

1284
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:51.912
That food is still running
through him.


1285
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:06.112
<i>Heaven and nature sing</i>

1286
01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:10.001
<i>Heaven and nature sing</i>

1287
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:19.160
I've been sipping!

1288
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:20.635
This is good to me.

1289
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:22.711
Ah!

1290
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:25.037
Come on.

1291
01:05:25.110 --> 01:05:27.158
It's getting me up
outta my seat!


1292
01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:29.790
You feel that?

1293
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:32.271
You sound beautiful, Aunt May.

1294
01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:34.558
I'm gonna go ahead
and let Cameron sip some.


1295
01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:36.201
Hell no.

1296
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.111
Double the temperature,

1297
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:57.001
half the time.

1298
01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:58.197
Boom!

1299
01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:05.472
<i>You've got to finish strong, baby.</i>

1300
01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:15.726
<i>I haven't even done
my small business speech yet.</i>


1301
01:06:15.750 --> 01:06:17.354
That's our "Yes, 
We Can" speech.

1302
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:19.766
I don't know what's in that
speech, but just keep saying it


1303
01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:21.474
because you're now
the growth candidate.


1304
01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:23.917
That means
that you are going to be...


1305
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:25.037
What the hell is this?

1306
01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:34.006
The rezoning's going to happen
with or without me, Pop.


1307
01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:35.846
They don't need my support.
Our prime purpose in life...


1308
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:38.086
If I plan to get into office, I
need theirs... is to help others.


1309
01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:40.166
If you can't help them, at the
very least, don't hurt them.


1310
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:42.326
But if I do not get elected into
office, how can I help, Pop?


1311
01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:44.557
Great progress
requires great sacrifice.


1312
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:46.195
Did you come up
with that yourself?


1313
01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:48.113
Or did your campaign manager
write it for you?


1314
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:51.239
People figure it out, Pop.
They always figure it out.


1315
01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:53.995
Your mother was seven years
old when your aunt was born.


1316
01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:55.206
Pop, please don't bring
Mom into this.


1317
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:57.119
Your grandparents
were having a tough time


1318
01:06:57.190 --> 01:07:01.081
and having another mouth to
feed didn't make it any easier.


1319
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:04.358
They ended up losing their home.

1320
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:06.160
And moving into a shelter.

1321
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:08.875
That shelter.

1322
01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:12.391
That's why it was
so important to her.


1323
01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:17.311
So the next time you talk
about people figuring it out,


1324
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:21.751
remember, one of those people
was your mother.


1325
01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:37.996
Oh, my God!

1326
01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:39.310
What the hell?

1327
01:07:42.670 --> 01:07:44.559
My macaroni and cheese!

1328
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:46.997
It was going to be disgusting.
I did you a favor.


1329
01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:49.681
Well, then do me a damn favor.
Don't burn down the damn house!


1330
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:50.797
'Got it!

1331
01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:51.996
Damn!
Lonnie!


1332
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:55.831
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

1333
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:57.674
What the hell did you all do?

1334
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:59.446
And you done sprayed some shit
on me, Lonnie?


1335
01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:01.518
I ought to whip your ass.
You raise your goddamn...


1336
01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:02.796
Shut up!

1337
01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:05.516
You can't afford to buy me
no more outfits like this.


1338
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:06.836
This my damn Chaka Khan.

1339
01:08:06.990 --> 01:08:08.435
Chaka Khan. Chaka Khan!

1340
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:15.757
Five days.

1341
01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:18.638
I knew it was going to be tough.

1342
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:22.957
But I said, "Surely the
children she loved so much


1343
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:25.556
"and damn near gave her life for

1344
01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:28.714
"would find a way
to make it work."


1345
01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:32.674
Obviously, I was wrong.

1346
01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:36.275
And disappointed.

1347
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:41.036
I expect you all
will clean this up.


1348
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:48.555
I'll tell you what. I'll be the better
man between the both of us. Okay?


1349
01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:49.956
I'm sorry.

1350
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:52.150
You going to be the better man
between the both of us?


1351
01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:57.033
There! Messed up
my damn Chaka Khan wig.


1352
01:08:57.150 --> 01:08:59.286
You see what happened just now?
Do you see what happened?


1353
01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:00.646
You don't do that to a man!

1354
01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:02.606
That wasn't no man I did it to.
Here, you take this rag.


1355
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:04.646
You old big-lipped son of a bitch.
You take that one.


1356
01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:05.717
Good luck.

1357
01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:07.554
No. Don't even try, Christian.

1358
01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:09.966
I'm not the one who tried to
deep-fry the whole kitchen, am I?


1359
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:12.960
No. And I don't think I was making the
blackeroni and cheese over there.


1360
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:14.640
So I think we should just go.

1361
01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:16.166
You want some pizza
and wings or something?


1362
01:09:16.190 --> 01:09:17.486
You know I gotta watch
my carbs, right?


1363
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:18.557
That's fine.

1364
01:09:18.630 --> 01:09:20.686
They got that high school cheerleader
menu you can order from.


1365
01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:21.950
Shut up, dude.

1366
01:09:22.030 --> 01:09:23.270
It's all good.
Right?


1367
01:09:41.190 --> 01:09:42.840
Okay, I'm done.

1368
01:09:43.190 --> 01:09:44.191
Great!

1369
01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:48.476
So now, I can remake
the macaroni you ruined.


1370
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:51.201
No. I'm going to make
the dressing you ruined.


1371
01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:54.359
Rachel, you're being ridiculous.
No. I need to get my stuff.


1372
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:55.955
Rachel, stop.
You always do this.


1373
01:09:56.070 --> 01:09:57.276
I need all this.

1374
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:58.636
Why are you taking my stuff?

1375
01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:00.712
I need the noodles.
No.I need...


1376
01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:04.595
Oh, my God.

1377
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:06.271
Oh.

1378
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:45.516
Mom's fried chicken.

1379
01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:48.434
"Always use
a cast iron skillet."


1380
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:50.926
That's why mine
never turned out right.


1381
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:52.395
Yeah, she did.

1382
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:55.874
Buttermilk biscuits.

1383
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:58.954
Christian would kill for this.

1384
01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:01.112
And Brooks would kill us.

1385
01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:02.874
Let's give it to him.

1386
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:04.281
Carbs!

1387
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:10.598
Her collard green recipe.

1388
01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:13.401
Smoked turkey necks,
half a cup of sugar,


1389
01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.393
and a pinch of bugs.
Bugs.


1390
01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.436
So amazing.

1391
01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:22.354
Did you find
the sweet potato pie recipe?


1392
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:26.480
Oh, God. Mom made it so often I
don't even think she wrote it down.


1393
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:29.879
Look at this.
Wow.


1394
01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:32.431
Aw!

1395
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:50.836
I think I'm going
to go outside for a minute.


1396
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:08.116
<i>What's up? It's your girl,
Jazz. Leave a message.</i>


1397
01:12:09.310 --> 01:12:10.960
Hey, Jasmine. It's Rachel.

1398
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:15.035
Look, I made a mistake
in inviting you to dinner.


1399
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:16.600
And I'm really sorry.

1400
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:19.281
And I hope it doesn't totally
screw up your whole day.


1401
01:12:20.710 --> 01:12:22.121
Merry Christmas.

1402
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:38.838
There's maybe
more sugar, butter.


1403
01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:41.675
It looks like Grace's.

1404
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:46.154
Will it taste like it?
Let's see.


1405
01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:54.280
What are you doing here?

1406
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:57.433
Me and bunny were elected
to tell you that


1407
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:59.239
everyone is really sorry.

1408
01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:02.394
They say you wouldn't be mad
at me 'cause I'm too cute.


1409
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.275
And they are right.

1410
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:07.159
You all ready for Santa?

1411
01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:08.231
Am I'.>

1412
01:13:08.310 --> 01:13:11.280
I get to see all my presents,
and eat all the dessert I want,


1413
01:13:11.390 --> 01:13:13.677
and not get in trouble.

1414
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:17.277
And Nana's sweet potato pie
is my favorite.


1415
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:19.474
Mine too.

1416
01:13:19.550 --> 01:13:22.520
I just hope my version
doesn't disappoint everyone.


1417
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:25.353
So far, it hasn't been
going that good.


1418
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:27.353
Are you smiling
when you make it?


1419
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:30.641
When Nana cooked,
she always smiled.


1420
01:13:30.710 --> 01:13:32.599
You haven't smiled a lot,
Pop-pop.


1421
01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:34.115
When I get sad,

1422
01:13:34.190 --> 01:13:37.478
I just think about all the
things that make me happy.


1423
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:38.790
And then I smile.

1424
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:42.199
Maybe you should try it.

1425
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:47.674
Maybe I will.

1426
01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:06.751
Hot!

1427
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:17.795
What do you think, love?

1428
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:32.161
Eggs.

1429
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:41.839
Just a little bit of cinnamon.
Now, remember that. Little bit.


1430
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:44.880
Sweet vanilla.

1431
01:14:45.790 --> 01:14:47.201
All right?

1432
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:48.601
And nutmeg.

1433
01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:50.471
That's the bomb.

1434
01:14:52.190 --> 01:14:55.911
I can't remember how much milk
you put in this.


1435
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:57.797
Uh-huh.

1436
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:01.716
Yeah.

1437
01:15:31.550 --> 01:15:34.918
Hey, yo, Pops.
Santa came early.


1438
01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:47.916
Oh, man.

1439
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:31.119
You want some
sweet potatoes, baby?


1440
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:33.031
30. Daddy?
Hmm?


1441
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:35.230
How do you like the cranberry salad?
Pretty good, huh?


1442
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:36.317
Very good.

1443
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:39.078
I made the stuffing.
Do you like it?


1444
01:16:39.150 --> 01:16:40.993
Tasty.
Cheryl, would you like some?


1445
01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:45.279
Yes. I would, Rachel.

1446
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:46.795
That's very nice of y'all.

1447
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:48.713
There you go.
I'm going to be a copycat.


1448
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:50.280
Thank you.
I want some stuffing too.


1449
01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:52.671
You can't get
enough stuffing, can you?


1450
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.195
Sure can't.

1451
01:16:54.430 --> 01:16:55.477
Let me get that.

1452
01:16:55.670 --> 01:16:57.399
Do you want some stuffing, baby?

1453
01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:00.552
Boy, I'm a grown-ass woman.

1454
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:02.446
Cameron, you mind passing me
the green beans, please?


1455
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:03.631
Don't eat too much.

1456
01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:05.872
We should save some for
the shelter. Right, Granddad?


1457
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:07.190
That's right, buddy.

1458
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:08.556
This is really delicious.

1459
01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:11.594
Listen, if I promise not to cook,
can we do it again tomorrow?


1460
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:16.192
Oh. Careful. Watch the floors
there, Cam.


1461
01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:18.591
Never know when
we gotta resell. Right, Pops?


1462
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:21.270
Right.

1463
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:24.479
If you want to get scratches out of
wood floors, here's a little trick.


1464
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:27.394
You get some shoe polish
and some Crisco oil.


1465
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:28.756
Get a pair of old underwear.

1466
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:31.561
Wrap the old underwear around
your hand, nice and tight,


1467
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:33.635
and you buff it out.

1468
01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:36.520
Put a little muscle to it.
Buff it out real good.


1469
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:39.246
I'm sure you got a pair of old
underwear lying around, Walter.


1470
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:40.920
Little trick I learned
over in Croatia.


1471
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:42.631
Listen.

1472
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:46.240
I'ma stab your ass with this fork.
Do you hear me?


1473
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:47.471
I would love that.

1474
01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:48.711
Evan.

1475
01:17:49.710 --> 01:17:52.006
What's going on with you? You've
been moping around all day.


1476
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:53.790
Nothing, yo. I guess
I just lost my appetite.


1477
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:55.190
Well, that's never
happened before.


1478
01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:57.790
I love the new paint
on the porch, Pops.


1479
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:59.790
Evan, we were talking to you.

1480
01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:00.996
And the hedges.

1481
01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:03.916
You've been meaning to clean those
up for a while now. It's nice.


1482
01:18:04.230 --> 01:18:06.676
I guess you finally
got around to it now, huh?


1483
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:10.591
Yeah.

1484
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:12.671
I guess I did.

1485
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:17.876
You know they have these new
fiberglass gutters, right?


1486
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:20.038
- Lonnie, shut your ass up.
- Lonnie, please.


1487
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:21.596
Now, damn!

1488
01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:24.150
Evan, baby,
what you talking about?


1489
01:18:25.190 --> 01:18:26.999
What am I talking about?

1490
01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:32.394
Tell 'em, Dad. Tell everybody
what it is I'm talking about.


1491
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:34.070
Wait a minute.
What the hell is going on?


1492
01:18:37.150 --> 01:18:38.390
Dad, you're selling the house?

1493
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:40.952
No. You're joking, right?

1494
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:44.752
You did this without
saying anything to us?


1495
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:46.486
Cheryl, give that to me.
That's not what that is.


1496
01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:48.319
Let me see this.

1497
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:50.518
Come on now, Walter.

1498
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:51.886
You know you should've
said something to somebody.


1499
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:54.206
Pop, Mom would have
spoken to everyone in this house


1500
01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:55.710
before she made
that kind of decision.


1501
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:57.486
Mom wouldn't even think
about selling the house.


1502
01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:58.636
This is the family home.

1503
01:18:58.710 --> 01:18:59.871
It's my house.

1504
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:02.086
Let me tell y'all something.
I understand...


1505
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:03.635
We're just a little confused.

1506
01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:05.314
It's really sudden, Dad.

1507
01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:07.311
It's my house.

1508
01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:08.926
Why would you
even consider that?


1509
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:11.112
It's my house!

1510
01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:21.279
I'm supposed to ask your
permission to sell my house?


1511
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:24.234
Evan, baby. Get him.

1512
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:25.471
Evan!

1513
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:26.676
Evan, come back!

1514
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:45.398
Well, at least we know
it can't get any worse.


1515
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:48.916
I'll get it.

1516
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:02.437
Hey, everybody,
there's a lady named Jasmine.


1517
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:04.120
She says
she's Aunt Rachel's friend.


1518
01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:15.757
Hey!

1519
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:16.991
Hey!
What are you doing here?


1520
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:18.595
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas!


1521
01:20:18.670 --> 01:20:19.796
You invited me.

1522
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:22.077
I did. Did you not
get my message?


1523
01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:23.356
No. Oh.

1524
01:20:23.670 --> 01:20:24.671
Um...

1525
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:27.790
I never check my voicemails.
I'm a texter.


1526
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:30.914
What was it?
Am I not supposed...


1527
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:31.990
No. No.

1528
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:34.112
I just wanted to make sure
you brought something.


1529
01:20:34.190 --> 01:20:36.079
And you did!
You're a mind reader.


1530
01:20:36.150 --> 01:20:37.231
This is great.

1531
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:38.311
Jasmine,

1532
01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:40.237
this is my family.

1533
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:41.311
Family, this is Jasmine.

1534
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:42.721
Okay, we have names.

1535
01:20:43.230 --> 01:20:46.200
That's sister, father,
brother, sister-in-law, child.


1536
01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:47.470
Nice to meet you all.

1537
01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:50.350
- You can sit right here.
- Welcome.


1538
01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:52.596
Why would you do that?

1539
01:20:52.670 --> 01:20:54.046
Why would I do that?
Why would you do that?


1540
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:55.486
What are you trying to do?
Break up a happy home?


1541
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:56.686
Obviously, it's not that happy

1542
01:20:56.710 --> 01:20:58.830
if you are banging the cashier
from the Piggly Wiggly.


1543
01:20:58.870 --> 01:21:02.841
You invited her to Christmas
dinner with your sister.


1544
01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:06.312
Who does that?

1545
01:21:06.390 --> 01:21:07.471
Who does what?

1546
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:11.680
Who puts paprika
in potato salad?


1547
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:13.718
Who does that?

1548
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:15.673
Everybody.
Not my family.


1549
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:18.794
We don't put paprika on potato salad.
We just don't do that.


1550
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:21.111
Okay, Lonnie, you're being
ridiculous. Come on.


1551
01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:22.606
I'm talking to your sister
about the potato salad.


1552
01:21:22.630 --> 01:21:24.326
Okay, we're in the middle
of Christmas dinner.


1553
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:25.795
You can talk to her later.
Okay.


1554
01:21:25.870 --> 01:21:27.474
Come on now. Come on.

1555
01:21:28.710 --> 01:21:29.836
Help me!

1556
01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:33.757
Okay. You like
them brownies, don't you?


1557
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:35.719
This must be a special recipe.

1558
01:21:42.590 --> 01:21:43.751
I love your home, by the way.

1559
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:45.116
Yeah? Thank you.

1560
01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:46.396
It's so beautiful.

1561
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:47.806
I really think
you should. They're very good.


1562
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:48.846
I already had 'em, baby.

1563
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:49.917
Really pretty.

1564
01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:57.240
I love your family.

1565
01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:58.436
Thank you.

1566
01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:59.796
I still have some.

1567
01:21:59.870 --> 01:22:02.032
That's okay.
That's okay.


1568
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:03.600
Yeah, they are good.

1569
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:15.951
Is there any more dressing?

1570
01:22:16.030 --> 01:22:19.079
No dressing on this table.
I'm going to go grab some.


1571
01:22:19.150 --> 01:22:20.276
Lonnie, sit down.

1572
01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:23.156
Lonnie?

1573
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:25.513
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.


1574
01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:27.680
What are you doing here?

1575
01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:30.475
Rachel, you know Lonnie.

1576
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:33.159
I'd love some ham. Thank you.

1577
01:22:33.230 --> 01:22:34.231
Some ham?

1578
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:37.678
How about I just stick a slice
at a time in your mouth?


1579
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:40.871
You were trying to surprise me.

1580
01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:45.316
That is so sweet.

1581
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:47.393
So, you two know each other?

1582
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:52.515
Yeah, well, when you called me
from the supermarket


1583
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:55.275
when I was getting those ingredients
for the banana pudding.


1584
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:57.631
Bananas, the vanilla,
the vanilla wafers.


1585
01:22:57.710 --> 01:23:00.759
It's not every day around here you
run into a professional athlete


1586
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:04.232
who invites you to spend
a weekend in Chicago.


1587
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:08.166
- What is going on?
- And you definitely don%run


1588
01:23:08.190 --> 01:23:11.797
into people nice enough to invite you
to such a beautiful Christmas dinner.


1589
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:18.351
So, Rachel knew that you knew Lonnie
when she invited you to our dinner?


1590
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:19.471
Mmm-hmm.

1591
01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:22.798
I got a little toothache here.

1592
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:23.917
Orajel.

1593
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:25.276
You were saying?

1594
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:26.397
Well...

1595
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:29.041
See, she recognized him
from one of our pictures.


1596
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:30.111
Oh!

1597
01:23:30.430 --> 01:23:32.114
There's pictures!

1598
01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:33.237
Shit!

1599
01:23:33.310 --> 01:23:34.596
You got a Instagram?

1600
01:23:34.670 --> 01:23:35.717
Want to see?

1601
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:37.271
No.

1602
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:38.721
I'd love to.

1603
01:23:40.910 --> 01:23:42.321
Are you getting this?

1604
01:23:45.470 --> 01:23:46.801
How sweet!

1605
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:47.951
Right?

1606
01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:50.072
Just cute.

1607
01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:51.515
Christian?

1608
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:58.472
Oh. Uh... Don't swipe left.

1609
01:23:59.550 --> 01:24:02.315
I was thinking Lonnie and I wouldn't
get to spend Christmas together


1610
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:04.313
because of his grandma.

1611
01:24:06.190 --> 01:24:07.191
Cheryl?

1612
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:08.550
Oh! Shit!

1613
01:24:08.630 --> 01:24:09.995
Shit!
Hey, Cameron,


1614
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:11.406
you and Niya take
your sister downstairs.


1615
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:12.646
Finish your meal
down there, okay?


1616
01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:14.726
- But I didn't even get to see the pictures.
- Now!


1617
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:16.718
I need to see these pictures.

1618
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:18.280
You get your plate.

1619
01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:21.326
- And you get yours. And your napkin.
- You can move faster than that.


1620
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:23.486
See? I always get treated like this.
You need to whip his ass.


1621
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:25.006
This is the problem
with these children nowadays.


1622
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:26.714
I never get to see stuff.

1623
01:24:26.790 --> 01:24:28.997
Sonya, you gotta take
more control.


1624
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:30.714
This is not fair.

1625
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:32.756
Be on back.

1626
01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:33.911
Is that oil?

1627
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:35.111
I Skyped you.

1628
01:24:35.190 --> 01:24:36.630
- Thank you.
- Wait for me.


1629
01:24:40.230 --> 01:24:41.959
All right. Here we go.

1630
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:46.197
Your Grandma Cheryl.

1631
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:51.632
It's obvious that
she misunderstood...


1632
01:24:51.710 --> 01:24:53.360
Thanks.
What I said.


1633
01:24:54.430 --> 01:24:57.354
You said your grandmother was sick,
and you had to take care of her.


1634
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:58.566
And I love that about you, babe.

1635
01:24:58.590 --> 01:25:00.606
- Just shut up.
- So proud of you.


1636
01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:04.271
Where is she? I would love
to meet your grandma.


1637
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:05.840
I'd love to meet Grandma Cheryl.

1638
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:09.039
No, baby. You don't want
to meet Grandma Cheryl.


1639
01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:10.311
You know what?

1640
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:12.750
I'll get Grandma.

1641
01:25:13.470 --> 01:25:14.471
Baby.

1642
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:16.958
Aunt May going to ask you
not to go get Grandma.


1643
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:18.156
Don't disturb Grandma.

1644
01:25:18.230 --> 01:25:19.959
I think it's the perfect time
for it.


1645
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:21.166
I'ma ask that
you let Grandma rest


1646
01:25:21.190 --> 01:25:25.434
because every time Grandma come out,
something different starts to happen.


1647
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:27.751
We don't have to impress
nobody with Grandma.


1648
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:30.561
Walter, your old ass need
to do something.


1649
01:25:30.670 --> 01:25:32.566
Now, you sitting there like
you don't hear this shit.


1650
01:25:32.590 --> 01:25:33.671
Lonnie,

1651
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.678
you don't want her
to get Grandma.


1652
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:38.951
Christian.

1653
01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:41.399
Let's go in the kitchen.
How about that?


1654
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:42.471
I'm good.

1655
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:44.435
Sonya.

1656
01:25:46.710 --> 01:25:50.601
Auntie May, let's go
make some kimchi balls.


1657
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:53.401
Hey, Lonnie. Can't help you.

1658
01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:56.874
Baby, did I say something wrong?

1659
01:25:57.430 --> 01:25:59.114
You said a lot of things wrong.

1660
01:25:59.190 --> 01:26:00.476
You want to meet Grandma?

1661
01:26:02.430 --> 01:26:03.636
Well, here she is.

1662
01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:06.206
- Don't shoot me!
- Wait a minute.


1663
01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:08.278
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!


1664
01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:10.799
Cheryl! Cheryl! Wait!

1665
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:13.430
Give me that gun!

1666
01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:16.834
You all knew who Grandma was!

1667
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.991
That's not Grandma!

1668
01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:20.357
This is ridiculous!
Somebody say something!


1669
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:21.801
Lonnie, what the hell
is going on?


1670
01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:22.871
Shut up!

1671
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:24.236
I'm his wife, you dumb bitch.

1672
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:25.590
Who you calling a dumb bitch?

1673
01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:28.037
You! You dumb bitch, young
bitch, silly bitch, dead bitch.


1674
01:26:28.110 --> 01:26:29.236
She got the gun, bitch.

1675
01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:31.686
Lonnie, if you're going to bring
bitches in here, bring a smart bitch.


1676
01:26:31.710 --> 01:26:33.792
Give me that rifle,
and give it to me right now!


1677
01:26:33.870 --> 01:26:35.440
Stay out of this, Christian.

1678
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:36.637
Christian, get her!

1679
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:40.234
I'm too old for this shit.

1680
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:42.271
Shit!

1681
01:26:43.350 --> 01:26:44.397
Shit!

1682
01:26:44.550 --> 01:26:45.551
Christian, stop her.

1683
01:26:45.750 --> 01:26:49.232
Cheryl, please! No, no, no!

1684
01:26:49.710 --> 01:26:50.830
Cheryl, drop the gun.

1685
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:53.915
Cheryl, you're not going
to shoot me.


1686
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:56.800
You're not going to shoot me outside
in front of all these people.


1687
01:26:58.110 --> 01:26:59.760
- Cheryl, please!
- Enough!


1688
01:26:59.830 --> 01:27:01.126
- Walter.
- Okay. That's enough.


1689
01:27:01.150 --> 01:27:03.437
Shit! You shot me!
Cheryl, please. Enough.


1690
01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:06.161
She's the best shot
in the family, Lonnie.


1691
01:27:06.230 --> 01:27:09.916
If she wanted to shoot
your ass, she would have.


1692
01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:14.076
Come on.
I'm taking the gun now.


1693
01:27:14.190 --> 01:27:16.511
Give it to him, baby.
Let me have it.


1694
01:27:17.550 --> 01:27:18.711
I got you.

1695
01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:20.601
We all got you.

1696
01:27:21.510 --> 01:27:23.399
We all got you, all right?

1697
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:38.361
Something happened
to Uncle Evan!


1698
01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:39.636
What?

1699
01:27:51.790 --> 01:27:53.315
Evan's going to be fine.
Thank God.


1700
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:56.075
He's a little banged up,
but very lucky.


1701
01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:59.399
We still need to run a few more tests,
but he should be okay to go home.


1702
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:20.911
I don't need...

1703
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:22.116
Any help.

1704
01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:23.991
I know.

1705
01:28:37.830 --> 01:28:39.832
I can't believe this is
how we're going to remember


1706
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:41.833
our last Christmas in the house.

1707
01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:45.240
At least Evan's okay.

1708
01:28:47.910 --> 01:28:49.116
Cheryl...

1709
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:53.594
What I did...

1710
01:28:55.710 --> 01:28:58.111
No matter what,
no matter how I felt,


1711
01:29:00.150 --> 01:29:01.151
it was awful.

1712
01:29:04.110 --> 01:29:05.714
Yeah, it was.

1713
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:09.281
I'm sorry.

1714
01:29:18.710 --> 01:29:20.200
No.

1715
01:29:20.350 --> 01:29:22.512
You probably did me a favor.

1716
01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:27.393
Lonnie had a wandering eye

1717
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:30.113
and a wandering everything else.

1718
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:31.840
He wasn't going to change.

1719
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:34.919
And he refused to floss.

1720
01:29:41.790 --> 01:29:45.192
But as much as I want to blame
Lonnie for everything,


1721
01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:51.237
I probably could have been
a little less...


1722
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:52.636
Overbearing?

1723
01:29:55.550 --> 01:29:57.075
Controlling.

1724
01:29:58.910 --> 01:30:01.197
You're also ambitious
and generous


1725
01:30:01.270 --> 01:30:03.352
and the smartest woman
that I know.


1726
01:30:04.270 --> 01:30:05.760
I always wanted to be like you.

1727
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:10.636
You wanted to be like me?

1728
01:30:10.710 --> 01:30:14.192
Yeah! You're my big sister.
Of course.


1729
01:30:14.270 --> 01:30:15.681
I was always jealous of you.

1730
01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:20.034
I mean, Mom and Dad always let you
just figure it out on your own.


1731
01:30:21.190 --> 01:30:22.954
Highly overrated.

1732
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:28.801
I was jealous of you
because you never had to.


1733
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:31.757
Also overrated.

1734
01:30:36.670 --> 01:30:40.516
So, what are you going to do?

1735
01:30:43.510 --> 01:30:44.750
I don't know.

1736
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:51.350
Maybe you could help me
with my divorce?


1737
01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:54.514
If you ever get that law degree.

1738
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:57.080
You can't help yourself,
can you?


1739
01:30:57.710 --> 01:31:00.793
I just can't.
Just gotta... You know?


1740
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:02.713
Learned this one.
I earned it.


1741
01:31:07.230 --> 01:31:08.561
How you doing?

1742
01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:12.912
Okay.
Yeah.


1743
01:31:18.350 --> 01:31:20.000
Quite an accident, huh?

1744
01:31:22.390 --> 01:31:25.314
Being high on pain pills
probably didn't help.


1745
01:31:31.670 --> 01:31:34.116
Mom's never going
to see me graduate,


1746
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:37.592
never see me in pros,

1747
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:39.954
get married,

1748
01:31:40.670 --> 01:31:42.399
have my first kid.

1749
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:47.711
She was supposed
to be my date to the draft.


1750
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:50.839
We talked about what we was
going to wear and everything.


1751
01:31:52.990 --> 01:31:55.072
I know you're missing
your mother.


1752
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:58.552
She was always there for you.

1753
01:31:58.630 --> 01:31:59.756
Yeah.

1754
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:02.954
Yeah, she was.

1755
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:07.757
She was always cheering
the loudest.


1756
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:15.552
Every time I caught the ball.

1757
01:32:16.750 --> 01:32:20.277
Every time I dropped the ball, she
still was cheering the loudest.


1758
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:23.711
Every moment in my life,

1759
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:27.071
my mother was there for me.

1760
01:32:30.150 --> 01:32:31.959
The one time...

1761
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:35.079
The one moment
that she needed me,


1762
01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:37.073
I was not there for her.

1763
01:32:37.230 --> 01:32:38.356
Evan.

1764
01:32:39.230 --> 01:32:42.200
You were exactly
where she wanted you.


1765
01:32:42.630 --> 01:32:45.918
Watching you do what you love

1766
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:49.038
is what she loved.

1767
01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:53.360
I mean, she's still watching you
and loving every minute of it.


1768
01:32:55.230 --> 01:32:57.153
It's not fair.

1769
01:32:59.150 --> 01:33:01.039
It's not. I know.

1770
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:04.077
But numbing the pain
doesn't make it go away.


1771
01:33:04.150 --> 01:33:06.198
Neither does selling the house.

1772
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:20.441
Without

1773
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:23.914
your mother,

1774
01:33:27.230 --> 01:33:28.436
it's like...

1775
01:33:29.630 --> 01:33:30.756
It's like

1776
01:33:31.790 --> 01:33:33.679
learning to walk again.

1777
01:33:41.630 --> 01:33:42.995
Though...

1778
01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:46.393
I guess we're gonna
both have to learn together.


1779
01:33:57.790 --> 01:34:00.760
There they are. Managing
directors of Brigham's.


1780
01:34:00.830 --> 01:34:02.406
They just want to meet you
before they leave town.


1781
01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:03.431
It's not a big deal.

1782
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:04.766
Let's just get it over with.
All right?


1783
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:06.310
Let's get it over with.
Come on. Smile.


1784
01:34:12.350 --> 01:34:15.399
Walter, I'm so glad
you could make it.


1785
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:18.231
We needed you more
than ever this year.


1786
01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:21.197
I think I needed you even more.

1787
01:34:23.710 --> 01:34:25.041
Merry Christmas.

1788
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:28.199
Merry Christmas.

1789
01:34:29.710 --> 01:34:31.366
- That is so true.
- I tell ya.


1790
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:34.234
Because the truth is, we are going
to make more money than anybody.


1791
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:36.358
It's going to make people sick.
And you, my man...


1792
01:34:36.830 --> 01:34:38.514
We're going to take you
to the White House.


1793
01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:41.439
Yes, sir. I'm not joking.

1794
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:42.955
Don't think I'm playing.

1795
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:49.151
<i>Our prime purpose in life</i>

1796
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:50.874
<i>is to help people.</i>

1797
01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:56.392
<i>And if we cannot help them, at
the very least, don't hurt them.</i>


1798
01:34:58.870 --> 01:35:00.006
You're going to be happy.

1799
01:35:00.030 --> 01:35:01.550
And you, my man,
are going to be happy.


1800
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:02.791
Right?

1801
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:05.195
I can't do this.

1802
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:08.677
I'm serious. We can take
it to the top. What?


1803
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:11.521
I believe it. I know we can.

1804
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:13.513
Have a good evening, gentlemen.

1805
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:18.998
Merry Christmas and God bless.

1806
01:35:27.670 --> 01:35:32.119
I'm not allowing this place
to go without a fight.


1807
01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:37.120
Don't worry, Pop.
You won't be fighting alone.


1808
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:43.838
You see this old man
skimping on your dressing?


1809
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:45.395
Come on, Pop.

1810
01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:47.438
That's more like it.

1811
01:35:47.590 --> 01:35:48.955
Merry Christmas to you.

1812
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:50.271
Thank you.

1813
01:35:57.670 --> 01:35:59.718
I love you, Pop.
I love you, son.


1814
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:23.194
"If you're going to help me
with my divorce,


1815
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:26.672
"you gotta finish law school
first. Cheryl."


1816
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:32.311
Wow.

1817
01:36:59.830 --> 01:37:03.357
<i>Is this Grandmaster Munchie
Mega Mellow Mix, Volume 7?</i>


1818
01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:07.956
<i>It's Mellow Mega Mix, Volume 8.</i>

1819
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:09.270
The one I made just for you.

1820
01:37:11.510 --> 01:37:13.353
That was a good mix tape.

1821
01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:15.561
It was.

1822
01:37:15.750 --> 01:37:17.036
What are you doing?

1823
01:37:19.670 --> 01:37:22.071
We missed out on something
special 20 years ago.


1824
01:37:22.190 --> 01:37:24.670
And I'll be damned
if I let that happen again.


1825
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:30.233
So, I was wondering,
if you're not busy tonight


1826
01:37:31.190 --> 01:37:33.113
will you let me take you
to the prom?


1827
01:37:38.670 --> 01:37:39.671
Rachel?

1828
01:37:40.190 --> 01:37:41.191
Rachel?

1829
01:37:49.710 --> 01:37:51.474
Just gonna leave me
out here like that?


1830
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:55.959
I was digging through my mother's attic
for two hours looking for this tape.


1831
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:58.206
Munchie? You
making a lot of noise out there...


1832
01:37:58.230 --> 01:38:00.312
Ma, go to bed!

1833
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:02.881
This is crazy.

1834
01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:05.199
She ain't never gonna change.

1835
01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:17.591
Damn.

1836
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:25.881
Damn.

1837
01:38:34.470 --> 01:38:35.835
It's Cheryl's.

1838
01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:39.960
I kind of barbecued mine

1839
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:41.913
after, you know...

1840
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:47.400
May I have this dance?

1841
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:50.871
Yeah.

1842
01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:05.350
It's gonna be a terrible night.

1843
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:08.114
Absolute worst.

1844
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:57.353
Talk about going out
with a bang.


1845
01:40:00.990 --> 01:40:02.230
Yeah.

1846
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:05.121
I sure am going
to miss this old house.


1847
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:08.156
Yeah.

1848
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:11.031
Hmm.

1849
01:40:13.190 --> 01:40:14.237
When I

1850
01:40:16.230 --> 01:40:18.073
proposed to Grace,

1851
01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:24.439
I knew I was going
to do everything I could


1852
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:26.751
to give her
the best life possible.


1853
01:40:31.670 --> 01:40:33.081
Sometimes I...

1854
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:38.592
Sometimes I think
I didn't do enough.


1855
01:40:40.710 --> 01:40:43.236
I really didn't think
it was possible.


1856
01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:46.751
But you really are dumber
than you look.


1857
01:40:49.230 --> 01:40:50.595
You know,

1858
01:40:51.630 --> 01:40:56.318
I've performed with some
of the greatest entertainers


1859
01:40:56.670 --> 01:40:58.911
to ever grace a stage.

1860
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:04.033
And I've dined atop
of the Eiffel Tower


1861
01:41:04.230 --> 01:41:08.474
as the lights shined as
bright as a thousand stars.


1862
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:13.718
Even got drunk
in a pub in Denmark


1863
01:41:13.870 --> 01:41:16.316
with the Count of Rosenberg.

1864
01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:19.560
He was a huge fan.

1865
01:41:19.710 --> 01:41:22.520
That was when I was on that
Sly and the Family Stone tour.


1866
01:41:22.590 --> 01:41:23.630
Mmm-hmm.
Remember that one?


1867
01:41:23.670 --> 01:41:24.910
Little Sister.
Yes.


1868
01:41:26.910 --> 01:41:28.241
Yes, indeed.

1869
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:33.070
You know,

1870
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:40.199
I'm living
my happily ever after.


1871
01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:43.394
And because of you

1872
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:45.515
and with you,

1873
01:41:46.590 --> 01:41:49.196
my beautiful sister

1874
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:52.513
got to live
her happily ever after, too.


1875
01:42:01.150 --> 01:42:02.515
Yes, she did.

1876
01:42:10.990 --> 01:42:12.594
How you like it?

1877
01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:13.796
That's Turkish coffee.

1878
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:17.670
Got that on the Chaka Khan tour.
Tell Me Something Good, 1982!


1879
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:20.080
Best coffee I ever had.

1880
01:42:21.110 --> 01:42:22.157
Yes, indeed.

1881
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:26.841
You know what?

1882
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:30.237
We ain't tried your pie, Walter.

1883
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:32.278
Maybe it's for the best.
No.


1884
01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:34.239
How bad could it be?

1885
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:36.631
Well. Well, we gonna see.

1886
01:42:39.670 --> 01:42:41.513
I'm tryin' to scoop
that piece out of there.


1887
01:42:42.190 --> 01:42:46.081
You put this together, Walter. Now,
let's see what we're dealing with.


1888
01:43:35.110 --> 01:43:36.316
I'll be damned.

1889
01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:42.161
Well, wait a minute,
Walter. Damn!


1890
01:43:42.230 --> 01:43:44.232
You ain't gonna eat
all of it! Give me some.


1891
01:43:44.910 --> 01:43:46.275
There's a little crust there.

1892
01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:49.911
Hey!

1893
01:43:50.750 --> 01:43:53.037
Hey, Cheryl! Sonya!

1894
01:43:53.710 --> 01:43:56.236
Come on.
Rachel, come on. All of you!


1895
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:58.677
Come on down here
and get some of this pie!


1896
01:43:58.750 --> 01:43:59.911
I did it!

1897
01:44:01.150 --> 01:44:02.231
I did it!

1898
01:44:03.310 --> 01:44:05.631
I'ma get some more of this
Turkish coffee for everybody.


1899
01:44:05.710 --> 01:44:06.871
Okay, then.

1900
01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:10.318
Hey! Come and get
some of this pie! I did it!


1901
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:11.880
Come on, all of you!

1902
01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:13.315
Hey, Christian, all of you!

1903
01:44:13.390 --> 01:44:15.996
Hey, Cheryl! Evan! Rachel!

1904
01:45:05.950 --> 01:45:06.951
Nuts.

1905
01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:09.995
Am I tasting your nuts?

1906
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:16.916
You feeling like that,
Rachel? Huh?


1907
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:18.196
'Cause I'm every woman.

1908
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:20.006
I ain't scared of you, Aunt May.
Well, then bring...


1909
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:21.191
Bitch!

1910
01:45:24.150 --> 01:45:26.118
Cut. Cut!

1911
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:28.517
Okay, Santa.
I'm going back in, baby.


1912
01:45:29.670 --> 01:45:30.876
How do you like that?

1913
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:34.119
Too much, Santa?

1914
01:45:34.190 --> 01:45:35.191
Hold on, now.

1915
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:40.356
To wash it all down, some milk
tea with boiled tapioca balls.


1916
01:45:40.670 --> 01:45:42.035
We don't put balls in our mouth.

1917
01:45:42.190 --> 01:45:43.840
Not necessarily.

1918
01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:50.471
Aunt May studied tae kwon do
in a dojo in Taipei,


1919
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:53.156
and they called me
Sensei Titty Chop.


1920
01:45:53.230 --> 01:45:56.313
You know why they called me that?
Because I chops bitches' titties.


1921
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:57.596
Ask Tina Turner about me.

1922
01:45:57.870 --> 01:46:01.113
I can always kick her ass. One time,
I had to titty-chop that bitch.


1923
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:03.846
Well, I'ma tell you, you can't
have none of this ass, Lonnie.


1924
01:46:03.870 --> 01:46:07.110
If you were biting your wife's ass some
more, maybe y'all have a happier marriage.


1925
01:46:07.510 --> 01:46:09.126
Bite it, lick it,
whatever you need to do.


1926
01:46:09.150 --> 01:46:10.510
She look unhappy
as shit out there,


1927
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:13.076
worrying about do the fish
have goddamn teeth.


1928
01:46:13.230 --> 01:46:14.516
Baby, do I bite your ass?

1929
01:46:14.670 --> 01:46:16.081
Every night.

1930
01:46:16.590 --> 01:46:17.876
You heard that?

1931
01:46:21.550 --> 01:46:23.518
My bags are in the car.
Mmm-mm.


1932
01:46:23.630 --> 01:46:25.155
My bags aren't in the damn car.

1933
01:46:25.230 --> 01:46:27.153
They in the driveway. Okay?

1934
01:46:27.230 --> 01:46:28.726
That's where my shit is.

1935
01:46:28.750 --> 01:46:30.832
And because I ain't had
my medication,


1936
01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:33.277
I don't know what I'm saying,
goddamn Walter.


1937
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:34.391
Damn!

1938
01:46:34.470 --> 01:46:37.997
You could just have something rolled for
me or something when I come to visit.


1939
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:40.198
That's why you killed
my damn sister off.


1940
01:46:40.270 --> 01:46:41.840
Because you
don't treat her right.


1941
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:42.957
Shit!

1942
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:48.797
Cut.

1943
01:46:51.110 --> 01:46:52.635
<i>All right, cut! Cut!</i>

1944
01:46:53.950 --> 01:46:55.714
<i>Cut! Cut. Let's do it again.</i>
