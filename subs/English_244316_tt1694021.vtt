1
00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:06.121
Come on.

2
00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.418
Hey, Beckett. Why don't
I get to carry the rifle?


3
00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:33.782
'Cause you're too young.

4
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:53.036
Try to keep up!

5
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.747
Rowan!

6
00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:06.748
Rowan!

7
00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:10.886
Rowan!

8
00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:16.260
Get away from my brother!

9
00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.101
I packed what I could.

10
00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.876
- There's a map and the trail is marked.
- Good.


11
00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.674
OK. Listen, I'm gonna set out tomorrow.
I'll be gone three days, tops.


12
00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.150
Sit tight. Don't talk to anybody.

13
00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.948
You did the right thing.

14
00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:17.347
We'll find Johnny. 
Don't you worry.

15
00:04:18.324 --> 00:04:19.314
Rowan?

16
00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.183
Be careful.

17
00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:25.054
You're taking too many.
It's not right.


18
00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:28.361
The mother's with cubs. 
It's off limits.

19
00:05:30.963 --> 00:05:32.625
It's gettin' late.

20
00:05:49.148 --> 00:05:50.741
I think we got a problem.

21
00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:53.784
Johnny Cadillac's not too happy.

22
00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:06.760
We're headin' back, tomorrow.

23
00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:07.994
No, we're not.

24
00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:09.968
Well, you've taken enough, already.

25
00:06:10.303 --> 00:06:11.635
Sheriff gave us a week, to hunt.

26
00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:15.170
And you don't get paid until we're done.
You got that?


27
00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:17.606
I don't want your money.

28
00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:30.454
This is gonna complicate things.

29
00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:32.287
I know pretty, when I see it.

30
00:06:32.358 --> 00:06:34.657
You stay here. 
I'll clean this shit up.

31
00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.338
Pike?

32
00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.312
What the...

33
00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.693
Well, hello!

34
00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:43.685
Hi.

35
00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:46.224
You gonna let a woman dance by herself?

36
00:07:47.867 --> 00:07:49.096
No, we can't have that.

37
00:08:21.234 --> 00:08:25.965
- Hey! Gently!
- I haven't... I'm sorry. I'm sorry.


38
00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:28.273
Here we go. Here we go.

39
00:08:28.908 --> 00:08:31.343
Haven't been with a girl
in a while, have you?

40
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:33.543
You don't know the half of it.

41
00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:47.017
- I am gonna take care of you.
- C'mere, c'mere, c'mere.


42
00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.652
No. First you gotta take care of me.

43
00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.492
Guess you wanna be
on the bed for that?

44
00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:55.156
- No. No, I was talking about money, dummy.
- The money?


45
00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:57.192
Yeah.

46
00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:00.898
Jesus.

47
00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:01.963
Listen, I, uh...

48
00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:06.005
OK, wait, wait. 
I didn't know this was...

49
00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.947
You know... no, no, no, no, no.

50
00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:12.082
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Hold up. Whoa, whoa, whoa.


51
00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.212
You have to go.

52
00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:16.222
- What?
- You gotta go.


53
00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:20.083
Well, it doesn't really work like that.
I mean, you brought me here so...


54
00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:23.155
Use me, or not, but you gotta pay.

55
00:09:23.229 --> 00:09:25.562
What'd you think? That this was
your lucky night, or some shit?


56
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.291
Come on, let's just...

57
00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:31.861
Just give me something, I...
I can't go back like this.


58
00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:38.472
Come on. You gotta leave.

59
00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:39.840
Fuck you!

60
00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.551
<i>What the fuck did I tell you!</i>

61
00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:52.683
Get the fuckin' money first! Huh?
Did I tell ya?


62
00:09:56.796 --> 00:09:58.822
<i>Huh? What am I supposed to do, huh?</i>

63
00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:05.035
I always say get the fuckin' money.

64
00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:07.339
<i>Huh? What? What? What?</i>

65
00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:14.673
This piece of shit here, huh? Yeah? Yeah.

66
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:32.188
Hey, hey. Hey! 
Hey, hands where I can see 'em.

67
00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:35.232
Come on. Hey! Dammit! 
Get your hands up.

68
00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:38.398
Hey, wider. Ha-ha.

69
00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:48.136
Son of a bitch. Come here.

70
00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:50.575
Get up. Get up, you little shit.

71
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.616
How'd you like that?

72
00:10:52.685 --> 00:10:54.745
- Fuck you!
- Shut up. Hands on your head.


73
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.413
Get your head down.

74
00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:01.216
Beckett!

75
00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.060
What's goin' on?

76
00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:04.256
Rowan's back.

77
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.799
- Your Rowan? What's he doin' here?
- Hell if I know.


78
00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:10.192
- Please, give us a second.
- Hey.


79
00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:14.033
- Well, he got you pretty good, huh?
- That fuckin' psycho attacked me.


80
00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:15.472
Lemme see. Huh, yeah...

81
00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:18.808
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Fuckin' asshole!


82
00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:20.608
- Slow it down.
- God!


83
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.616
This is a small... quiet town, Franco.

84
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:29.045
Sully, here, is near retired. He doesn't
need trouble from a guy like you, so...


85
00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:33.586
I see you here again, you're gonna
get a lot more than a broken nose.


86
00:11:33.659 --> 00:11:35.287
Go on. Get outta here.

87
00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:36.420
What about her?

88
00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:40.428
I'll drive her home. 
You deal with your brother.

89
00:11:41.834 --> 00:11:42.824
Yeah...

90
00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:54.406
- What you doin' here?
- I grew up here, remember?


91
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.708
- I remember. When'd you get out?
- What do you care?


92
00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:01.676
Seven years.

93
00:12:04.056 --> 00:12:06.787
Seven years, you come back here,
like some random act of violence.


94
00:12:06.859 --> 00:12:09.192
- You point a fuckin' gun at me?
- Police procedure, pal.


95
00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:11.490
- Fine. OK.
- No family discounts.


96
00:12:11.864 --> 00:12:14.197
Hey, you sure you got the
right guy, lawman? Really?


97
00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:18.294
No. When you left, 
I was worried sick about you.

98
00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:21.800
Then I heard what you did. 
That you shot a man.

99
00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:29.174
Then I said... 
No... no, that's not my brother.

100
00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:35.514
You know, I thought you'da learned by now, that
there's consequences to your actions, but...


101
00:12:37.323 --> 00:12:38.916
maybe you need another lesson.

102
00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:44.493
Boy, that's some boyfriend you got there, lady.

103
00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.613
Welcome home.

104
00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.897
You changed the place.

105
00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:22.423
Yeah.

106
00:13:26.806 --> 00:13:28.775
There's a new boss of the house.

107
00:13:30.176 --> 00:13:31.337
Where's she?

108
00:13:33.746 --> 00:13:35.408
She's out in the bush.

109
00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.956
- Michelle needed a workspace, so...
- Yeah.


110
00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:56.659
She was a photojournalist, from
the east coast. She, uh...


111
00:13:56.735 --> 00:14:02.335
fell in love with the wildlife,
became a biologist, a researcher...


112
00:14:02.408 --> 00:14:05.037
Now, she's out on
the trail, almost every day.

113
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.772
- This her, here?
- Yeah.


114
00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:11.477
Conservationist, huh?
How'd you get her to marry you?


115
00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.085
I put away my hunting rifle.

116
00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:20.448
- For good?
- Yep.


117
00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:26.196
- What's this?
- Radio frequency identifications..


118
00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:29.531
We've collared about 200 animals,
in the past couple years.


119
00:14:29.602 --> 00:14:31.969
Had to wear one of these
on my ankle, for a year.

120
00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:35.138
Why are you here, Rowan?

121
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:41.706
I was gonna go out to the Grizzly Maze and pay
respect to dad, where it really meant something.


122
00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.477
Couple of nights, come back, disappear,
and you wouldn't even know I was here.


123
00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:46.783
I'm not here to mess with your life.

124
00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:53.415
Well, you can sleep in
my old room... if you want.

125
00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:55.923
Think I'll take the couch.

126
00:15:34.466 --> 00:15:36.230
Keep your eyes out.

127
00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:43.100
Hey!

128
00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:50.111
- So, what do we got?
- Right there, just like I said.


129
00:16:49.241 --> 00:16:50.265
Marcus!

130
00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.672
Marcus!?

131
00:16:58.717 --> 00:16:59.912
Marcus!

132
00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.451
Don't even think about it.

133
00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:15.817
Hey, listen...

134
00:18:17.362 --> 00:18:19.593
Technically, half of all this, is mine.

135
00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:22.131
Well... well, I don't mean
to burst your bubble, Rowan,


136
00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:24.295
But I don't think you
made it into the will.

137
00:18:26.638 --> 00:18:28.470
Don't worry, I'll be gone, soon.

138
00:18:30.142 --> 00:18:34.546
I was gonna go join Michelle, a
little later, out at dad's flats, and


139
00:18:35.214 --> 00:18:38.378
check on some snares and,
if you wanna wait for me...


140
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.419
Yeah, thanks, but, uh... I
gotta do this one alone.


141
00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:43.078
Yeah. Great.

142
00:18:54.099 --> 00:18:55.192
Hey, uh...

143
00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:00.932
Now that you're a free man.

144
00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.122
It was like a lifetime ago.

145
00:19:23.929 --> 00:19:27.226
Well, I gotta get to work, so,
I'll meet you upstairs, uh...


146
00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:29.925
Alright.

147
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:46.930
Hey, uh...

148
00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:53.790
Bear spray and a tranquilizer gun?

149
00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:58.188
Yeah, I thought about usin' it on the bastards
that've been huntin' around here without a permit.


150
00:19:58.263 --> 00:19:59.663
Jesus! Who the hell are you?

151
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.369
I don't know. Talkin' about
makin' the maze a protected zone.


152
00:20:04.836 --> 00:20:06.668
Dad would've appreciated that.

153
00:20:07.339 --> 00:20:12.473
Yeah. You know, we'll be campin' out there
in dad's flats, if you change your mind.


154
00:20:14.279 --> 00:20:18.307
I'll probably be in the maze, by then, so...
but... thanks.


155
00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:25.147
What're you up to, Rowan?

156
00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:31.320
I was gonna wait for you to leave and... go rob a
bank, you know, score a fix. The usual, you know.


157
00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:35.423
- I know you. Somethin's up.
- You don't know me.


158
00:21:58.283 --> 00:22:00.081
We got a real mess.

159
00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:04.011
- Couple bootleg cutters, or what's left of 'em...
- Yeah?


160
00:22:04.089 --> 00:22:06.947
- Blood everywhere, no bodies.
- Jesus.


161
00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:09.252
- Yeah.
- Last night or this morning?


162
00:22:09.328 --> 00:22:11.661
I don't know. We'll get up there.
See what's going on.


163
00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:13.624
Hey, Kaley.

164
00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:15.163
- Hey.
- Hey.


165
00:22:15.233 --> 00:22:18.362
Coroner's on his way. He wanted me to
come up and start collecting the remains.


166
00:22:18.437 --> 00:22:22.097
Kaley... what we gonna do without you?

167
00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:24.871
I guess he'll have
to get his hands dirty.

168
00:22:34.486 --> 00:22:43.174
- Hi, folks.
- What's goin' on?


169
00:22:37.189 --> 00:22:40.591
Well, the guns weren't fired. One
of the saws is still in the tree.


170
00:22:40.859 --> 00:22:42.725
Hand clutching the trigger.

171
00:22:42.794 --> 00:22:45.389
Some body parts scattered,
but most of it's gone.


172
00:22:46.498 --> 00:22:49.224
- Yeah, it's a bear.
- You're goddam right, it's a bear.


173
00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:52.101
It's a nasty one, too.

174
00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:57.475
What the hell kind of animal would come
around a man with a runnin' chainsaw?


175
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:59.642
I ain't ever seen that before.

176
00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:03.780
- Well, he's certainly hungry.
- No. Desperate's more like it, uh...


177
00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:07.010
It's when they get dangerous,
when they're desperate.


178
00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:08.417
Douglas, what're you doin' here, huh?

179
00:23:10.422 --> 00:23:12.618
It's a crime scene. Go on.

180
00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:16.723
I was huntin' bears when you were still
playin' with tiddly winks, asshole.


181
00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:21.660
Back to business, I wouldn't be a bit surprised
this wasn't one of your pets that done it.


182
00:23:21.733 --> 00:23:22.894
You got a bear around here?

183
00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:25.597
No, I don't have a bear around here.
It's not one of my collars.


184
00:23:25.771 --> 00:23:27.330
What're you. some kind of psychic?

185
00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:30.337
Let's check the signals.

186
00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:36.011
- Beckett, check the fuckin' signals.
- Yeah, I'll check. I'll check 'em.


187
00:23:37.015 --> 00:23:39.610
- Alright, that's our current position, right now.
- Mmm-hmm.


188
00:23:39.684 --> 00:23:41.778
- And... yeah, there's one bear.
- Mmm-hmm.


189
00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:44.254
Sheriff, it looks like you
want me to go huntin' now, huh?


190
00:23:44.322 --> 00:23:45.790
You got the money, 
I got the time.

191
00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:48.417
Hey, hey, hey. You can't
shoot a collared bear, pal.


192
00:23:48.493 --> 00:23:50.860
OK? You understand? That's the law. Alright?

193
00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:52.795
- Not without proof, understand?
- Back up. Back up, there.


194
00:23:52.864 --> 00:23:54.492
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You understand the law?


195
00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:56.296
- What?
- You're wife's out there. Your brother.


196
00:23:56.568 --> 00:23:58.503
You're worried about a fuckin' bear?

197
00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:00.870
Somebody's gonna go after this thing.

198
00:24:01.072 --> 00:24:02.335
He's the best tracker I know.

199
00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:04.399
He's a butcher, OK? 
That's all he is.

200
00:24:04.776 --> 00:24:09.839
I'm gonna go out there myself. I'll get Michelle
out and I'll capture the damn bear, OK?


201
00:24:09.915 --> 00:24:13.682
You wanna use this guy so bad, have him
set up traps around here, in this area.


202
00:24:13.752 --> 00:24:16.722
But he stays the
hell away from the forest.

203
00:24:16.788 --> 00:24:18.188
- Alright? I mean it.
- Anything you say, Deputy.


204
00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:23.000
I'm just here to help. But just so you
know, this ain't your average bear.


205
00:24:23.394 --> 00:24:24.394
This is a clever one.

206
00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:27.827
I mean, how you think somethin'
that big can hide that good.


207
00:24:27.899 --> 00:24:31.995
Surprise two men in a clearing before
they can get even one shot off?


208
00:24:32.904 --> 00:24:34.873
It's a smart fucker, that's how.

209
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.136
You never met a
bear like this, before, Beckett.

210
00:24:37.209 --> 00:24:39.007
And if you did, you wouldn't
know what to do with it.


211
00:24:39.077 --> 00:24:40.101
Alright, are you done?

212
00:24:40.178 --> 00:24:41.646
- Yeah, I'm done.
- OK.


213
00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:45.175
- I'm just tellin' ya.
- And I'm hearin' ya.


214
00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:49.419
Sully, call me after you find the
next body, 'cause you will find it.


215
00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:51.145
Beckett!

216
00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:58.595
When you're out there... and you see that, listen
to me... and you see that bear, you kill it.


217
00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:02.695
Now go up there, find your wife
and get her the hell outta there.


218
00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:05.100
I'll close down the trails. Go on.

219
00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:09.007
Hey, Beckett.

220
00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:10.840
I'm comin' with you.

221
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:14.804
Gerry, find out how many people we got out
there and find a way to get 'em back.


222
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.715
Zoe, put out signs. Close all the trails.
Close 'em all.


223
00:25:18.783 --> 00:25:20.411
- You got it, boss.
- Alright.


224
00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:27.549
Here. You mind... carryin' this for me?

225
00:26:28.553 --> 00:26:32.051
- It's a tranquilizer gun.
- You really wanna capture this bear?


226
00:26:32.123 --> 00:26:33.386
Well, I... prefer to save it.

227
00:26:33.458 --> 00:26:37.723
Just in case.

228
00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:39.860
Watch it.

229
00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:46.728
C'mon, Kaley.

230
00:26:50.342 --> 00:26:53.141
Michelle can't be too far ahead,
if she left this morning.


231
00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:55.442
We gotta catch her
before she heads off trail.

232
00:26:55.513 --> 00:26:56.640
Why would she do that?

233
00:26:57.182 --> 00:27:01.984
Snares. She likes to set 'em when,
when she finds a bear trail.


234
00:27:06.424 --> 00:27:08.518
Look, why don't you head back?

235
00:27:09.928 --> 00:27:13.330
Look, I wanna help, I'm not
gonna slow you down, OK?


236
00:27:13.398 --> 00:27:16.095
Rowan's out here fast. 
You know that.

237
00:27:16.167 --> 00:27:18.762
- And why is he here?
- Hell if I know.


238
00:28:55.667 --> 00:28:56.828
You OK?

239
00:28:58.336 --> 00:29:00.771
Oh, boy. We need to get outta here.

240
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.278
You're Michelle.

241
00:29:07.345 --> 00:29:09.177
I'm
-I'm Rowan. I'm Beckett's brother.

242
00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:16.151
Holy shit! You're deaf! We
gotta get you outta here.


243
00:29:16.888 --> 00:29:19.790
Alright, alright, alright, alright. Here.

244
00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:21.491
Do you have... Listen, do
you have a first-aid kit?


245
00:29:21.993 --> 00:29:23.427
First-aid? A bandage?

246
00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:30.096
I'm deaf, not stupid.

247
00:29:31.402 --> 00:29:33.132
Fair enough. You read lips?

248
00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:35.336
Where is it, then?

249
00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:36.768
Over here? OK.

250
00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:57.451
- You ready? Come on.
- Yeah.


251
00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:26.818
Sheriff's department.

252
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:28.985
Douglas, you in there?

253
00:30:30.628 --> 00:30:33.097
Yo, Douglas! It's Sully. You here?

254
00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:49.770
Douglas?

255
00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.672
Sully, you nearly got your head blown off.

256
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:29.351
Listen, Douglas, if you're still up
for it I want ya to kill this bear.


257
00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:33.990
Thought Beckett was gonna adopt it, or somethin'.

258
00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:37.256
He's lookin' for his wife. 
I need a hunter.

259
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:40.396
So, that's why you're comin' to me, now?

260
00:31:41.232 --> 00:31:42.530
Sure. Why else?

261
00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:46.037
I dunno, maybe you're worried that
people might think it's your fault


262
00:31:46.104 --> 00:31:49.040
for lettin' assholes like Johnny
Cadillac take poachers out there?


263
00:31:49.574 --> 00:31:52.408
I mean, I'm not judgin' ya, Sully.
I can't even say I blame ya.


264
00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:55.140
I mean, a man's gotta do what he's
gotta do to survive. But, uh...


265
00:31:55.213 --> 00:31:59.776
With all the loggers and poachers,
out there, it upsets the balance.


266
00:31:59.851 --> 00:32:04.520
See, this bear, it... it's not
just territorial, or hungry...


267
00:32:05.189 --> 00:32:06.350
What is it?

268
00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:08.619
It's pissed off.

269
00:32:09.794 --> 00:32:12.161
Just a case of mother nature fightin' back.

270
00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:15.299
You're welcome to stay,
Sully, but I got shit to do.


271
00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:24.098
I just need you to kill this fuckin' bear.
The sooner, the better.


272
00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:27.838
Sully, I've been waitin' on
this bear my whole life.


273
00:32:27.912 --> 00:32:30.347
I'm just surprised it took this long.

274
00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:32.140
<i>Hey, Sheriff, come in?</i>

275
00:32:31.735 --> 00:32:32.801
Donne-moi ta main.

276
00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:34.981
Yeah, Zoe.

277
00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:39.248
I, uh... just posted a sign at Skyline.
I found something, here.


278
00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:41.054
I think you guys
should come take a look.

279
00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.956
- <i>What is it?</i>
- It's Johnny Cadillac's car.


280
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.389
Any sign of him?

281
00:32:47.799 --> 00:32:49.529
Huh-uh. It's been here awhile.

282
00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:52.292
Sheriff?

283
00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:54.195
Zoe?

284
00:32:59.711 --> 00:33:01.236
Zoe! Come in!

285
00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:07.174
Zoe!

286
00:33:15.493 --> 00:33:17.996
- I'll call ya when it's done.
- Let's go.


287
00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:25.030
<i>Beckett, come in!</i>

288
00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:27.837
Hey, go, Sully.

289
00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:29.396
- You find Michelle?
- <i>No.</i>


290
00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:30.567
No, not yet.

291
00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:32.872
I sent Douglas after the bear.

292
00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:36.972
- Ah, Christ, Sully, why the hell...
- <i>There's been another attack.</i>


293
00:33:37.615 --> 00:33:40.346
Zoe. I think she's gone.

294
00:33:44.589 --> 00:33:46.455
- Where?
- <i>Skyline Trailhead.</i>


295
00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:48.458
<i>Found a car. 
Johnny Cadillac's.</i>

296
00:33:49.127 --> 00:33:51.096
This bear's near ya, son.

297
00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:54.127
Find your wife. 
Get the hell outta there.

298
00:33:54.198 --> 00:33:55.188
Yeah.

299
00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.631
Copy that. OK, thanks.

300
00:34:00.004 --> 00:34:01.666
- You ever use one of these?
- Yeah.


301
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:05.171
Thumb down, safety off. Alright?

302
00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:08.943
Won't stop a bear, but...
might scare it.


303
00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:11.542
Maybe.

304
00:34:25.706 --> 00:34:26.572
You OK?

305
00:34:28.948 --> 00:34:29.748
OK.

306
00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:32.768
I'm gonna pitch the tent, make a fire.

307
00:34:32.988 --> 00:34:33.988
Alright?

308
00:34:34.508 --> 00:34:35.508
OK.

309
00:34:36.328 --> 00:34:37.928
Here we go.

310
00:34:41.077 --> 00:34:42.610
Oh, shit, Zoe.

311
00:34:51.209 --> 00:34:52.276
Stay cool.

312
00:34:53.096 --> 00:34:55.096
One step at a time.

313
00:34:55.116 --> 00:34:57.816
Whaddaya think happened to
Johnny and those poachers?


314
00:34:57.836 --> 00:34:59.536
I figure they're gone, too.

315
00:34:59.556 --> 00:35:01.056
You don't know that.

316
00:35:01.076 --> 00:35:06.076
It's been twelve days. Twelve days,
Gerry, and they're not back yet.


317
00:35:08.653 --> 00:35:11.853
Sully, maybe you need
to come clean on this.

318
00:35:11.873 --> 00:35:14.673
Zoe's dead. What else you gonna do?

319
00:35:15.493 --> 00:35:19.093
Give Beckett some help. Worry
about the rest, later.


320
00:35:32.732 --> 00:35:33.799
Holy shit.

321
00:35:41.734 --> 00:35:43.534
She used her bear spray.

322
00:35:43.554 --> 00:35:45.554
What the hell happened here?

323
00:35:47.993 --> 00:35:50.026
I'm deaf, not stupid.

324
00:35:50.746 --> 00:35:52.746
I think she met Rowan.

325
00:35:52.766 --> 00:35:56.866
<i>Douglas and Beckett's dad were the
same kind of hunters, old school.</i>


326
00:35:56.886 --> 00:35:59.986
- Lived on what they got.
- Thought they were guides.


327
00:36:00.006 --> 00:36:05.606
Yeah, to pay the rent, now and then, but they'd
never take hunters into the Grizzly Maze.


328
00:36:05.626 --> 00:36:08.326
Never. Place was sacred to 'em.

329
00:36:08.346 --> 00:36:13.246
Then, one night... Douglas was
out with four Canadians...


330
00:36:13.266 --> 00:36:16.166
Bear got into their camp.

331
00:36:16.186 --> 00:36:19.760
Attacked Douglas, in his
sleep and Douglas managed to


332
00:36:19.981 --> 00:36:23.806
get his knife out and stab
the bear, under the chin.


333
00:36:23.826 --> 00:36:26.326
Right in the jugular. 
Saved his ass.

334
00:36:26.946 --> 00:36:29.846
- Jesus! That's impressive!
- Yeah.


335
00:36:30.466 --> 00:36:32.466
But he snapped...

336
00:36:33.686 --> 00:36:37.186
Week after he got out of the
hospital, he went back out there.


337
00:36:37.206 --> 00:36:40.506
Inside a few days, killed over 20 bears,

338
00:36:40.526 --> 00:36:42.526
left 'em all to rot on the ground.

339
00:36:42.546 --> 00:36:46.246
Then he started takin' hunters
into the maze, makin' money.


340
00:36:46.866 --> 00:36:50.366
Beckett's dad never talked to him, after that.

341
00:36:54.234 --> 00:36:56.234
- Ya alright?
- I got it.


342
00:37:02.649 --> 00:37:03.782
Welcome.

343
00:37:04.202 --> 00:37:06.202
Welcome to dad's flats.

344
00:37:06.822 --> 00:37:08.022
Wow.

345
00:37:09.242 --> 00:37:11.242
I've never been over
this side of the ridge.

346
00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:18.509
Hey.

347
00:37:26.973 --> 00:37:28.073
Hey!

348
00:37:28.293 --> 00:37:29.393
Hi!

349
00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.380
Bad girl. What happened to your leg?

350
00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.600
Here, let me take a look.

351
00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.320
Yeah, will ya?

352
00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.560
Bear. Rowan, O
-K.

353
00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.680
Where is he?

354
00:37:51.507 --> 00:37:53.674
You sure you're OK?

355
00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:08.173
Mind moving from there?

356
00:38:09.793 --> 00:38:11.693
Makin' me nervous.

357
00:38:15.487 --> 00:38:18.120
So that's the infamous Grizzly Maze.

358
00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.140
Yeah, that's what my
dad used to call it.

359
00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.460
'Cause even grizzly's can get lost down there.

360
00:38:26.963 --> 00:38:30.830
- You remember.
- Of course, I do.


361
00:38:33.161 --> 00:38:36.394
Why are you... why are you here?
What are you doin' up here?


362
00:38:36.614 --> 00:38:39.114
- Came with Beckett.
- Oh.


363
00:38:39.134 --> 00:38:41.034
He's down there.

364
00:38:41.054 --> 00:38:42.654
Came to find Michelle.

365
00:39:28.484 --> 00:39:32.351
- Excuse me.
- Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'?


366
00:39:33.382 --> 00:39:34.315
Leavin'.

367
00:39:34.335 --> 00:39:38.335
No, you're not, alright? No, 'cause I need you
to take the girls back down, tomorrow, OK?


368
00:39:38.355 --> 00:39:42.455
There's a killer bear out here. Three people
are already dead. I need to get after it.


369
00:39:44.241 --> 00:39:46.270
Hey, hey! You hear what I said?
You're not leavin'!


370
00:39:46.291 --> 00:39:47.695
I'm not asking your permission.

371
00:39:47.715 --> 00:39:50.015
- Alright, guys. Just relax.
- Kaley... stay out of it.


372
00:39:50.035 --> 00:39:53.135
You lied to me. You wanna tell
me about Johnny Cadillac?


373
00:39:53.155 --> 00:39:55.155
- Get out of my way.
- No!


374
00:39:55.175 --> 00:39:58.275
You're gonna tell me what the hell you're
doin' out here, or I'm going to arrest ya.


375
00:39:58.295 --> 00:40:01.695
Ha! You're gonna arrest me?
For carryin' bear insurance.


376
00:40:01.715 --> 00:40:04.715
Nope. For illegal possession of a firearm.

377
00:40:11.927 --> 00:40:13.027
Hey! Hey!

378
00:40:15.524 --> 00:40:16.757
Guys, come on!

379
00:40:16.977 --> 00:40:18.677
Are you done, yet?!

380
00:40:30.643 --> 00:40:32.043
What're you, fucking twelve?

381
00:40:33.544 --> 00:40:34.544
Jesus!

382
00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:42.113
Johnny was supposed to
be back five days ago.

383
00:40:42.433 --> 00:40:45.533
Took poachers into the maze, never came back.

384
00:40:45.553 --> 00:40:48.453
Mary called me. Didn't wanna come to you.
Didn't wanna come to Sully.


385
00:40:48.473 --> 00:40:50.173
Thought you'd throw him in jail.

386
00:40:50.193 --> 00:40:51.693
That's what I'm here for.

387
00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.783
To help the one guy,
who stood up for me.

388
00:40:55.803 --> 00:40:57.803
Thought it'd be a great
idea to hide it from me?

389
00:40:58.723 --> 00:41:02.123
Three people dead. 
Michelle got attacked.

390
00:41:02.143 --> 00:41:06.043
- Yeah, that's right, and I saved her life.
- That's not what I'm talkin' about, dumbass!


391
00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:10.263
I tell you my wife is out here
campin' and you keep quiet?


392
00:41:12.083 --> 00:41:15.583
Johnny Cadillac and a couple of
poachers didn't go down by no bear.


393
00:41:15.603 --> 00:41:19.903
You take the girls home, tomorrow.
If I see your bear, I'll kill it.


394
00:41:19.923 --> 00:41:21.023
Fine.

395
00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.590
Come on, at least stay the night.
Go back in the morning.


396
00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:32.010
Grizzly out here might be comin' around.

397
00:41:34.038 --> 00:41:35.138
Please.

398
00:42:08.995 --> 00:42:12.128
All my other collars are... migrating north...

399
00:42:12.148 --> 00:42:14.648
in a pretty big radius.

400
00:42:17.108 --> 00:42:20.908
Michelle says, uh, she thinks
the bear is just scared.


401
00:42:20.928 --> 00:42:25.128
Looks like they're all leavin' the maze, you know?
Like they're runnin' from somethin'.


402
00:42:25.148 --> 00:42:27.848
That's gotta be the same bear
that went after Michelle.


403
00:42:27.868 --> 00:42:30.068
Yeah. Did you get
a good look at him?

404
00:42:30.088 --> 00:42:32.888
No, he stayed off in the woods.

405
00:42:32.908 --> 00:42:35.408
It's almost like he knew better
than to give me a clean shot.


406
00:42:35.428 --> 00:42:37.428
That was the biggest bear I've ever seen.

407
00:42:38.848 --> 00:42:42.348
Michelle says that it's... she
never got a chance to thank you.


408
00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:46.996
It's OK.

409
00:42:51.601 --> 00:42:55.668
And... I'm
-I'm sorry, OK?

410
00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.577
I could really use your help on this.

411
00:42:59.597 --> 00:43:03.397
Look, I'm not givin' up on Johnny, so whatever
you need from me, just don't ask me to do that.


412
00:43:03.417 --> 00:43:06.217
And if Douglas is out there, he's
gonna beat us to it, anyway.


413
00:43:06.237 --> 00:43:08.237
That's what I'm afraid of.

414
00:43:08.257 --> 00:43:12.057
Do you wanna kill this bear, or do you wanna
save it? You gotta make up your mind.


415
00:43:12.077 --> 00:43:14.077
I wanna kill the right bear.

416
00:43:14.097 --> 00:43:16.097
Jesus Christ, you gotta be kidding me!

417
00:43:16.117 --> 00:43:17.917
I got a friend out
there that needs my help.

418
00:43:17.937 --> 00:43:20.283
And if he gets killed out here,
runnin' around in the woods,


419
00:43:20.304 --> 00:43:22.457
poachin' bears, then he got
what he deserved, didn't he?


420
00:43:22.477 --> 00:43:24.477
You're a righteous prick.

421
00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:27.703
I'll take first watch.

422
00:43:38.919 --> 00:43:40.786
Did a nice job on her ankle.

423
00:43:42.611 --> 00:43:46.578
- Is it bad?
- No. It's OK. She'll walk.


424
00:43:47.173 --> 00:43:49.073
Assuming I can keep it from getting infected.

425
00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:51.893
So, you're a doctor, now... huh?

426
00:43:53.113 --> 00:43:57.213
That's funny, I... always
figured you'd leave this place.


427
00:43:59.166 --> 00:44:00.266
I am.

428
00:44:01.858 --> 00:44:03.125
In two weeks.

429
00:44:04.711 --> 00:44:05.844
Toronto.

430
00:44:07.582 --> 00:44:08.649
Really?

431
00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:13.503
Do you know how many
times I tried to contact you?

432
00:44:16.825 --> 00:44:18.892
What do you want from me?

433
00:44:19.361 --> 00:44:20.528
I don't know.

434
00:44:21.865 --> 00:44:23.032
Some answers.

435
00:44:25.779 --> 00:44:29.646
Stick to what you believe.
It's as good a story as any.


436
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:35.683
I once had my whole life planned
out, with you, in my head.


437
00:44:37.299 --> 00:44:39.366
What was I thinkin', huh?

438
00:44:41.005 --> 00:44:42.272
G'night.

439
00:45:53.945 --> 00:45:54.845
Kaley!

440
00:45:55.626 --> 00:45:58.126
Gimme your hand, gimme your hand!

441
00:46:06.002 --> 00:46:06.802
Kaley!

442
00:46:08.912 --> 00:46:09.712
Hey!

443
00:46:11.074 --> 00:46:11.874
Hey!

444
00:46:19.395 --> 00:46:20.862
Shoot, goddammit!

445
00:46:34.612 --> 00:46:35.945
You hurt? He get ya?

446
00:46:38.392 --> 00:46:40.858
Looks like your bear was trackin' us.

447
00:46:43.606 --> 00:46:45.639
Let's get our shit and get outta here.

448
00:47:05.502 --> 00:47:09.035
You mind explainin' to me
what that was all about?

449
00:47:09.795 --> 00:47:11.428
You know what I'm talkin' about.

450
00:47:11.448 --> 00:47:13.448
- I didn't have a shot.
- You didn't have a shot?


451
00:47:13.468 --> 00:47:15.668
Come on. You might
not get a better one.

452
00:47:16.088 --> 00:47:18.088
What were you doin' in that tent?

453
00:47:18.917 --> 00:47:21.017
- What?
- Shoulda been outside.


454
00:47:21.437 --> 00:47:23.837
- Was freezin' outside.
- Uh-huh.


455
00:47:29.276 --> 00:47:31.209
<i>Oh, come on... you were cold.</i>

456
00:47:42.211 --> 00:47:43.278
-What's goin' on?
- What's wrong?


457
00:47:48.552 --> 00:47:51.319
-Move yourself, right now.
- Get her arm, get her arm.


458
00:47:56.025 --> 00:47:57.025
You alright?

459
00:48:02.399 --> 00:48:04.132
We're in the kill zone.

460
00:48:04.818 --> 00:48:07.752
- Let's get outta here.
- Yeah. Let's move. C'mon.


461
00:48:27.012 --> 00:48:30.712
Damn. What do you think we should do?

462
00:48:31.844 --> 00:48:33.555
Let's just stick to Johnny's trail.

463
00:48:33.576 --> 00:48:36.264
I don't wanna take these
girls down in that maze.


464
00:48:36.284 --> 00:48:38.907
We should stick to
Johnny's trail. It leads us,

465
00:48:38.927 --> 00:48:41.503
right down to Teredo Point, it's
just on the other side of the maze.


466
00:48:41.523 --> 00:48:45.523
We radio Sully. He can come in,
pick us up, take us out by boat.


467
00:48:50.221 --> 00:48:53.088
Wanna go back up that
way, the way we came?

468
00:48:54.343 --> 00:48:58.643
- He's on our trail.
- Alright, let's try to lose him in the maze.


469
00:48:59.481 --> 00:49:00.947
It's our only shot.

470
00:49:14.288 --> 00:49:16.621
Sullivan, this is Beckett. Come in.

471
00:49:31.982 --> 00:49:32.982
Sully, wait up.

472
00:49:34.084 --> 00:49:40.384
Appreciate the help, Gerry, but I told ya already,
I need you back here to keep everybody calm.


473
00:49:40.404 --> 00:49:41.504
You're not going in there alone.

474
00:49:41.524 --> 00:49:45.324
If you haven't heard from me, by
tomorrow afternoon, call Fish and Game.


475
00:49:45.344 --> 00:49:49.144
- I should go with ya.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.


476
00:50:06.426 --> 00:50:07.359
Douglas!

477
00:50:08.179 --> 00:50:10.179
Man, that better not
be one of my bears!

478
00:50:10.836 --> 00:50:12.536
Are you lookin' for this?

479
00:50:13.149 --> 00:50:17.415
Dammit! I told you, man. If you
fuck with one of my bears again...


480
00:50:19.331 --> 00:50:21.831
- I'll deal with it.
- I'll be damned! Rowan, is that you back there?


481
00:50:22.051 --> 00:50:25.151
They let you out? 
I guess I was wrong.

482
00:50:25.171 --> 00:50:26.971
There is a fellow
hunter out here with me.

483
00:50:26.991 --> 00:50:29.591
I's just fixin' to cut this thing
open, you wanna come help me with it?


484
00:50:29.611 --> 00:50:32.111
I'd rather not. 
Back the fuck up!

485
00:50:32.131 --> 00:50:33.731
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!

486
00:50:33.751 --> 00:50:37.451
There's a camera on there, ya butcher! All
we gotta do is plug it in, see what he ate.


487
00:50:37.471 --> 00:50:39.571
Don't you go soft on me, too, son.

488
00:50:39.591 --> 00:50:42.239
Your brother, Beckett, here,
he thinks he knows bears


489
00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.711
'cause he puts them
cute little necklaces on 'em.

490
00:50:44.731 --> 00:50:48.731
- But you and me know when there's a problem.
- You're the only fuckin' problem here, old man.


491
00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:53.302
Hey, Rowan, now you been
gone a long time, bud.

492
00:50:53.322 --> 00:50:56.122
Lotta strange shit's happenin' around here.

493
00:50:56.742 --> 00:51:01.042
Beetle outbreaks. Salmon don't
swim upstream like they used to.


494
00:51:01.362 --> 00:51:03.362
Bears ain't got anything to eat.

495
00:51:03.782 --> 00:51:06.882
Throw people into that mix,
you're askin' for trouble.


496
00:51:06.902 --> 00:51:12.402
'Cause when a grizzly gets angry he don't give
a shit if you're a logger or a tree hugger.


497
00:51:13.222 --> 00:51:15.222
All of ya taste the same.

498
00:51:15.242 --> 00:51:18.242
Anyway, this ain't our bear.

499
00:51:18.262 --> 00:51:23.762
Don't look so sad, honey. That one was hurt, just
limpin' around. I just put it out of it's misery.


500
00:51:24.677 --> 00:51:29.810
But somewhere around here... there's a real rogue.

501
00:51:29.830 --> 00:51:32.630
A big, nasty, mean son of a bitch,

502
00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:35.950
and he don't give a shit what's
in his way, he'll eat it.


503
00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:37.570
Anything to survive.

504
00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:41.444
When a bear like that encounters man
for the first time, he just looks


505
00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:45.210
at him as a predator he's gotta get
rid of, 'fore it gets rid of him.


506
00:51:46.842 --> 00:51:50.042
- Yeah, well, let's find out.
- What you got?


507
00:51:56.824 --> 00:51:59.691
Holy shit! That's the bear from last night.

508
00:51:59.711 --> 00:52:03.811
See there? I told you so. Ripped
the collar off and broke his neck.


509
00:52:05.203 --> 00:52:06.403
Looks it. Yeah.

510
00:52:09.909 --> 00:52:13.309
Well, if y'all do run into him again...

511
00:52:13.929 --> 00:52:16.709
Split up to a 180. 
That way somebody can get a

512
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:19.349
side shot, 'cause if he's
chargin', you won't get 'im.


513
00:52:20.735 --> 00:52:22.335
Y'all have fun.

514
00:52:24.198 --> 00:52:27.731
Ya say, Beck? Still wanna
play darts with this thing?


515
00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:34.757
I like it.

516
00:52:59.445 --> 00:53:00.345
Bear!

517
00:53:18.744 --> 00:53:19.811
Watch your step!

518
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:33.790
No!

519
00:53:33.879 --> 00:53:34.679
Jesus!

520
00:53:34.699 --> 00:53:35.699
Kaley!

521
00:53:45.539 --> 00:53:46.439
Oh, my...

522
00:53:56.796 --> 00:53:58.696
- Tell me what to do. What do I do?
- OK.


523
00:53:58.716 --> 00:54:00.016
You need to cut the branch.

524
00:54:00.036 --> 00:54:02.036
- Cut the branch.
- Yeah.


525
00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.720
OK. You're OK. 
We're gonna get you outta here.

526
00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:06.940
It's not as bad as it looks.

527
00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.860
OK. Alright. Is anything broken?
Alright. Think it's broken?


528
00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:11.880
I gotta see it. 
I gotta see it.

529
00:54:12.337 --> 00:54:13.604
- Let's cut this off.
- How red's it get?


530
00:54:20.715 --> 00:54:21.615
It's fucking...

531
00:54:28.496 --> 00:54:30.063
You gotta pull it out.

532
00:54:30.116 --> 00:54:32.116
- What?
- You gotta pull it out.


533
00:54:32.136 --> 00:54:33.736
We got-you gotta pull it out.
You gotta pull it out.


534
00:54:33.756 --> 00:54:36.456
No, no, no. We pull it out,
she's gonna lose a lotta blood.


535
00:54:36.476 --> 00:54:37.776
Walkin' around with a stick in her leg?

536
00:54:37.796 --> 00:54:39.396
Well, just gimme a second. 
I can cut it off.

537
00:54:39.416 --> 00:54:41.716
- Then we're still hangin' around...
- No, no, don't, no. Just pull it out, OK?


538
00:54:41.736 --> 00:54:44.336
We're gonna stop the bleeding.
I can get up and stitch, OK?


539
00:54:44.356 --> 00:54:46.556
Just stabilize the ankle and
then he can pull it out.


540
00:54:49.214 --> 00:54:52.614
- I'll get the knee, you get the ankle.
- Alright. Keep it steady.


541
00:54:53.534 --> 00:54:54.434
OK.

542
00:54:54.454 --> 00:54:55.854
OK. On three, alright?

543
00:54:55.874 --> 00:55:00.174
- Ah!
- One, two... three.


544
00:55:02.575 --> 00:55:03.475
OK.

545
00:55:05.830 --> 00:55:06.930
God!

546
00:55:10.305 --> 00:55:13.072
- Almost done.
- Pressure, pressure.


547
00:55:13.092 --> 00:55:15.092
Gauze! Here's some gauze.

548
00:55:15.512 --> 00:55:17.512
- OK. Put this, on here.
- Both sides.


549
00:55:22.283 --> 00:55:24.483
W-what'd she say? 
What'd she say?

550
00:55:24.503 --> 00:55:27.503
When a bear smells the blood... we
gotta get rid of these clothes.


551
00:55:28.466 --> 00:55:31.166
You'll be alright. 
We'll get you outta here.

552
00:55:33.666 --> 00:55:34.600
We gotta move.

553
00:55:37.653 --> 00:55:39.986
Radio Sully. I'm sure he's on his way.

554
00:55:40.007 --> 00:55:42.607
Uh, go on. Here
we go. There we go.

555
00:55:42.627 --> 00:55:45.227
There you go, darlin'. 
We gotcha, we gotcha.

556
00:55:48.168 --> 00:55:51.034
Sully. Sully, come in.

557
00:55:58.675 --> 00:56:00.408
Sullivan, this is Beckett.

558
00:56:00.628 --> 00:56:01.828
Come in.

559
00:56:02.482 --> 00:56:03.582
Anything?

560
00:56:04.999 --> 00:56:07.066
Too deep in the maze.

561
00:56:09.257 --> 00:56:12.990
- Fuck.
- Sullivan. Do you read me? This is Beckett.


562
00:56:41.722 --> 00:56:43.289
Jesus Christ!

563
00:56:51.199 --> 00:56:52.132
Alright.

564
00:56:57.644 --> 00:57:00.311
- Uh, it's so slippery. Uh!
- OK.


565
00:57:03.436 --> 00:57:05.269
- Hang on.
- Wait here a minute.


566
00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.696
- Alright.
- What-what is it?


567
00:57:15.843 --> 00:57:18.510
- It's a cabin.
- Oh, thank God.


568
00:57:22.874 --> 00:57:24.607
OK, now, just lean on me.

569
00:57:29.774 --> 00:57:30.674
Oh...

570
00:57:36.857 --> 00:57:38.190
Here. Sit down here.

571
00:57:38.525 --> 00:57:39.558
There you go, honey.

572
00:57:39.578 --> 00:57:41.078
- Ya got her?
- Yeah.


573
00:57:41.098 --> 00:57:42.598
Hey, easy, now.

574
00:57:43.118 --> 00:57:45.118
There, that's it.

575
00:57:52.063 --> 00:57:57.463
Rowan! Wait! Wait, 
God... damn it!

576
00:58:02.005 --> 00:58:03.805
See this?

577
00:58:03.825 --> 00:58:05.825
- Gall bladders.
- Paws.


578
00:58:07.509 --> 00:58:09.509
Oh, the big money.

579
00:58:17.867 --> 00:58:21.067
Who's that? Is that him? 
Is that Johnny?

580
00:58:23.442 --> 00:58:24.342
Nah.

581
00:58:26.468 --> 00:58:27.668
Get the hell outta here.

582
00:58:29.008 --> 00:58:30.508
Don't touch anything!

583
00:58:33.132 --> 00:58:34.232
Let's go.

584
00:58:37.453 --> 00:58:38.920
C'mon, we gotta go.

585
00:58:39.039 --> 00:58:42.006
- What's wrong?
- We can't stay here.


586
00:58:42.947 --> 00:58:45.613
Still think those guys are worth savin'?

587
00:58:46.853 --> 00:58:47.887
Oh, my God.

588
00:58:49.584 --> 00:58:51.384
Goddamn savages.

589
00:58:53.319 --> 00:58:54.219
C'mon.

590
00:58:55.113 --> 00:58:57.613
- Let's go.
- OK.


591
00:58:58.904 --> 00:59:00.671
Watch it. Watch yourself.

592
00:59:03.103 --> 00:59:05.203
Hey. Lean on me, there.

593
00:59:10.042 --> 00:59:11.142
I gotcha.

594
00:59:23.963 --> 00:59:25.396
There's your boy.

595
00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:33.234
- No, don't do that. Leave 'im...
- Fuck off!


596
00:59:33.254 --> 00:59:35.190
Leave 'im up there. 
We'll come back and get help.

597
00:59:35.211 --> 00:59:39.074
You take 'im down now, the goddam
bear'll leave nothin' to bury.


598
00:59:41.424 --> 00:59:45.157
- I imagine you woulda liked that.
- Look, I'm sorry about that, OK?


599
00:59:47.692 --> 00:59:48.758
It's back!

600
00:59:49.098 --> 00:59:51.631
Douglas! What the hell
you doin' out here, man?

601
00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:53.251
Fucking hell, Douglas.

602
00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:56.057
Looks like your bear found Johnny.

603
00:59:58.852 --> 01:00:00.052
Good God almighty!

604
01:00:01.716 --> 01:00:03.049
Lord, have mercy!

605
01:00:03.252 --> 01:00:05.585
Chewed his leg, right off.

606
01:00:05.632 --> 01:00:08.499
It wasn't the bear that killed him, though.
Lookee, there.


607
01:00:08.519 --> 01:00:10.019
He was shot.

608
01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:13.139
I had a bad feelin' when I saw
him hangin' out with them guys.


609
01:00:13.159 --> 01:00:15.159
You have anything to do with this, Douglas?

610
01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:16.879
With this? Hell, no!

611
01:00:18.165 --> 01:00:23.965
They came to me, first, and they was snoopin'
around for a guide and... I turned 'em down.


612
01:00:23.985 --> 01:00:26.785
- I knew what they was up to.
- What?


613
01:00:26.805 --> 01:00:29.605
I seen 'em down at
the truck stop, all of 'em.

614
01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:31.225
What you talkin' about?

615
01:00:33.132 --> 01:00:36.799
- Why don't you ask your boss?
- My boss. Sully?


616
01:00:36.819 --> 01:00:39.719
You spend too much time huggin' trees, pardner.

617
01:00:40.339 --> 01:00:42.339
Johnny shoulda known better.

618
01:00:42.359 --> 01:00:44.959
I may be a lotta things, y'all, but...

619
01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:48.675
what these guys are
up to is pure evil.

620
01:00:48.995 --> 01:00:52.095
You start messin' with evil, you
open up the door to the devil.


621
01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:54.815
Well, so we're in hell, now.

622
01:00:55.932 --> 01:00:57.832
What're you up to, over there?

623
01:00:57.852 --> 01:01:00.952
Kaley's hurt. She can't walk.
Gonna take your horse.


624
01:01:00.972 --> 01:01:04.072
- Is that right?
- That's right.


625
01:01:04.092 --> 01:01:07.764
Well, listen, normally, I wouldn't mind
givin' y'all a ride on ol' Gus, but


626
01:01:07.785 --> 01:01:11.212
see, right now, we're huntin', and
we don't need no damn distractions.


627
01:01:11.232 --> 01:01:15.532
Well, you can keep on huntin'...
I just need ol' Gus.


628
01:01:15.552 --> 01:01:20.252
See, if I don't find that bear, before it
finds y'all... ain't gonna make it, anyway.


629
01:01:20.872 --> 01:01:24.372
- And it will hunt you. Trust me.
- That's a risk we'll take.


630
01:01:24.392 --> 01:01:26.992
Give the old man his horse back, Rowan.

631
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:30.203
Give 'im the horse, Rowan.

632
01:01:35.512 --> 01:01:36.779
Come on, Gus.

633
01:01:37.399 --> 01:01:38.899
Y'all like bein' hunted?

634
01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:43.119
Ain't a damn bit o' fun, believe me.

635
01:01:47.062 --> 01:01:49.529
I hope you know what you're doin'.

636
01:01:54.249 --> 01:01:55.582
Leaks more, we gotta carry her.

637
01:01:56.002 --> 01:01:57.902
Take my arm, let's carry ya.

638
01:01:57.922 --> 01:02:00.622
- OK, I got her.
- Gotcha.


639
01:02:00.942 --> 01:02:03.142
How come you never asked me what happened?

640
01:02:03.562 --> 01:02:06.762
What's there to know? Ya...
smuggled booze and shot a man.


641
01:02:06.782 --> 01:02:09.482
Alright! I got it.

642
01:02:09.902 --> 01:02:13.702
Let's just get outta here... and go our
separate ways, for good? How 'bout that?


643
01:02:13.722 --> 01:02:15.722
That's the best idea you've ever had.

644
01:02:15.742 --> 01:02:17.742
Uh, I don't feel too good.

645
01:02:17.762 --> 01:02:20.362
OK, I need to
keep it elevated for awhile.

646
01:02:20.382 --> 01:02:23.582
Michelle says... 
Kaley needs the restroom.

647
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:27.263
Oh, what? No, no.

648
01:02:27.284 --> 01:02:30.984
It's taken us two hours to go one mile. It's
double the amount of time it shoulda taken.


649
01:02:31.104 --> 01:02:32.904
We got no time.

650
01:02:32.924 --> 01:02:36.724
No, you're... I'm not bein' stubborn! You're
the one bein' stubborn. I know she's hurt.


651
01:02:37.944 --> 01:02:41.301
Alright, w... we're gonna wait here...
for a little while,


652
01:02:41.322 --> 01:02:45.764
but we gotta get outta here, way
before the sun comes up. OK?


653
01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:02.797
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.


654
01:03:03.927 --> 01:03:05.527
Can you get some sleep?

655
01:03:06.748 --> 01:03:08.548
Did you really shoot a man?

656
01:03:12.407 --> 01:03:14.440
- Get some sleep.
- Please, Rowan.


657
01:03:15.061 --> 01:03:19.161
I need to know. 
Don't make it be for nothing.

658
01:03:20.181 --> 01:03:23.985
You know, the last time I came up here
was with my dad, in the dead of Winter.


659
01:03:24.006 --> 01:03:28.601
My mom was not doin' great.
She needed the operation.


660
01:03:29.621 --> 01:03:31.221
But we had nothing.

661
01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:35.941
All I knew was, may dad just...
he needed to be up here.


662
01:03:36.561 --> 01:03:40.661
It's, like, the only place in the
world, he felt, made any sense to him.


663
01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:42.807
And the first night...

664
01:03:43.881 --> 01:03:47.876
I wake up and I
hear this... weird sound, and

665
01:03:47.897 --> 01:03:51.401
so I poked my head outside the
tent and it's snowing, and...


666
01:03:52.901 --> 01:03:55.101
and I see him. 
He's got his back turned to me...

667
01:03:56.148 --> 01:03:59.281
and he's... sobbing.

668
01:04:00.409 --> 01:04:03.377
Dad was the strongest man I've
ever met, and could survive


669
01:04:03.398 --> 01:04:05.962
in the wilderness, with a
hunting knife, for weeks.


670
01:04:05.982 --> 01:04:10.782
And there he was... cryin' his heart
out 'cause he couldn't save my mom.


671
01:04:13.635 --> 01:04:17.868
And that... uh... wrecked me.

672
01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:23.388
So, I went to Johnny Cadillac. He was the only
guy I knew who could get money, on the fly.


673
01:04:23.408 --> 01:04:28.308
I mean, he was harmless, I mean, he was
sellin' weed, to, you know, make ends meet.


674
01:04:28.328 --> 01:04:30.228
But his supplier was, the real deal.

675
01:04:30.248 --> 01:04:35.048
They were smuggling booze to, some of the
Indian towns, and they needed a guide.


676
01:04:35.068 --> 01:04:40.568
Um... the way I saw it, I didn't really
have a choice. So, I took the job.


677
01:04:40.588 --> 01:04:44.288
Um, easy enough. Everything went
smoothly, right up to the exchange.


678
01:04:44.308 --> 01:04:49.008
The, all of a sudden, we
get hit by State Troopers.


679
01:04:50.028 --> 01:04:52.928
And I found myself right in the
middle of a fuckin' shootout.


680
01:04:53.268 --> 01:04:54.435
So, what did you do?

681
01:04:54.456 --> 01:04:57.655
Well, I took the bag of money
and I ran off into the woods.


682
01:04:57.675 --> 01:05:02.075
I noticed there was a Trooper that'd...
been hit in the leg,


683
01:05:03.295 --> 01:05:07.795
crawlin' away, for his life, and one of
the smugglers, comin' up from behind him,


684
01:05:07.815 --> 01:05:09.815
just ready to put another
one right in his head.

685
01:05:11.171 --> 01:05:14.304
Jesus, one of those moments, when
you're just, like, what the f...


686
01:05:14.324 --> 01:05:17.424
How the hell did I
get here, in the first place?

687
01:05:21.979 --> 01:05:26.879
So, as soon as I saw the guy
raise his gun, I just...


688
01:05:28.099 --> 01:05:30.099
well, I stopped and I shot him.

689
01:05:31.976 --> 01:05:33.709
I weirded everyone my way.

690
01:05:35.271 --> 01:05:38.004
Fifteen seconds cost me seven years.

691
01:05:39.224 --> 01:05:42.424
- But, you saved a cop's life.
- I still killed a man.


692
01:05:43.044 --> 01:05:45.244
And I was the one holdin' the cash.

693
01:05:45.264 --> 01:05:50.964
I remember handin' over that bag of money
was like... puttin' my mom in the grave.


694
01:05:53.099 --> 01:05:55.599
Why didn't you tell anyone?

695
01:05:55.619 --> 01:06:01.919
I don't really have a great history of... people
in this town believin' what I have to say.


696
01:06:04.128 --> 01:06:06.328
You could've told me.

697
01:06:11.881 --> 01:06:13.614
I'm sorry, Rowan.

698
01:06:14.234 --> 01:06:17.534
- I'm so sorry.
- It's OK.


699
01:06:20.130 --> 01:06:21.630
Get some sleep.

700
01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:25.550
Michelle's probably freezin' out there.

701
01:06:54.741 --> 01:07:00.674
Listen, I was thinkin' maybe, uh... maybe
you and Michelle should just keep movin'.


702
01:07:01.494 --> 01:07:04.594
- I'll stay back, with Kaley, and...
- No.


703
01:07:08.714 --> 01:07:11.247
This time, we're stickin' together.

704
01:07:14.324 --> 01:07:18.924
For better or for worse. 
We stick together.

705
01:07:36.881 --> 01:07:37.881
Whoa.

706
01:07:58.103 --> 01:08:00.836
Buddy, I think we're
in for a long night.

707
01:08:21.946 --> 01:08:24.613
- Hear that?
- Gotta give it to him. He's one hell of a hunter.


708
01:08:35.705 --> 01:08:38.072
- Jesus, Rowan, you alright?
- Yeah.


709
01:08:41.903 --> 01:08:42.936
Douglas!

710
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:44.903
Douglas!

711
01:08:47.754 --> 01:08:48.821
Holy hell!

712
01:08:54.102 --> 01:08:55.202
Beck!

713
01:09:03.174 --> 01:09:04.174
Oh, shit.

714
01:09:07.392 --> 01:09:09.259
Rowan?! Rowan!

715
01:09:10.138 --> 01:09:12.038
- Kaley!
- Kaley!


716
01:09:12.566 --> 01:09:13.466
Kaley!

717
01:09:15.696 --> 01:09:17.196
Oh, what happened?

718
01:09:17.367 --> 01:09:19.334
Douglas is dead. He's dead.

719
01:09:19.354 --> 01:09:22.154
Leave the tent. Leave everything.
We're gettin' the hell outta here.


720
01:09:22.374 --> 01:09:24.474
- I'm stayin' here.
- What?


721
01:09:24.494 --> 01:09:25.994
- You heard me.
- The hell, you are!


722
01:09:26.014 --> 01:09:29.014
- Trust me, I know what I'm doin'.
- Rowan, no. It's suicide.


723
01:09:29.434 --> 01:09:31.434
I'm gonna lead it in the other direction.

724
01:09:31.756 --> 01:09:34.723
- You take the girls down to the beach.
- What?! No!


725
01:09:34.743 --> 01:09:38.343
- You heard me. Come on.
- No, you know, I'll do it. OK?


726
01:09:38.363 --> 01:09:41.363
I'm faster, and what, you're stronger.
Carry Kaley on your back.


727
01:09:43.276 --> 01:09:44.409
Come on.

728
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:48.750
There's five rounds left.

729
01:09:48.770 --> 01:09:50.770
There's one in the chamber.

730
01:09:51.079 --> 01:09:52.945
Make every shot count.

731
01:09:55.944 --> 01:09:58.877
- Asshole.
- Yeah, I know.


732
01:10:03.794 --> 01:10:06.661
It's not gonna be able to move
as fast as me, in the maze.


733
01:10:06.681 --> 01:10:08.681
Wait, what are-what are you doing?

734
01:10:08.701 --> 01:10:11.901
You're gonna play tag with it? It's crazy.

735
01:10:11.921 --> 01:10:16.221
Please.... it's our best shot.

736
01:10:29.456 --> 01:10:30.256
Go.

737
01:10:31.276 --> 01:10:34.076
Get outta here. Go!

738
01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:17.303
How far?

739
01:11:17.723 --> 01:11:19.323
Two miles, maybe.

740
01:11:19.328 --> 01:11:21.695
I need-I need a break
because it's really painful.


741
01:11:21.714 --> 01:11:24.314
OK, OK, here. By this tree.

742
01:11:24.834 --> 01:11:25.934
Easy.

743
01:11:32.112 --> 01:11:34.912
I'm gonna have to take
a look at this leg.

744
01:11:35.226 --> 01:11:38.393
Easy, now. Just gonna cut these off. Alright.

745
01:11:41.643 --> 01:11:42.776
Oh, God.

746
01:12:31.133 --> 01:12:32.333
Let's go.

747
01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:47.181
Oh, shit!

748
01:12:54.943 --> 01:12:56.143
Oh, fuck!

749
01:14:10.904 --> 01:14:11.937
Wait up.

750
01:14:18.698 --> 01:14:19.798
Rowan!

751
01:14:20.518 --> 01:14:21.718
Rowan!

752
01:14:30.521 --> 01:14:31.655
That's not Rowan!

753
01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:06.280
Where the hell is he?

754
01:15:17.778 --> 01:15:18.878
Fuck!

755
01:16:25.639 --> 01:16:26.539
Hey!

756
01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:17.130
God.

757
01:17:17.710 --> 01:17:18.710
OK.

758
01:17:37.235 --> 01:17:38.935
I gotta put you down.

759
01:17:41.828 --> 01:17:44.261
- Where's Sully?
- He's here.


760
01:17:45.454 --> 01:17:47.687
Help me. Help me.

761
01:18:07.629 --> 01:18:09.063
