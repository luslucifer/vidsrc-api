00:00:48.252 --> 00:00:50.819
Skye? Skye? Where are you?

13
00:00:50.993 --> 00:00:52.169
Amanda?

14
00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.694
There you are.
Gabriella wants to see us.


15
00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:57.609
It's important.
Something about the new line.


16
00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:00.655
Really? Did she like the
swatches I left on her desk?


17
00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.440
There's a great
new rose pink suede.


18
00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:06.096
It's all organic
and fade resistant.


19
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.532
Pink? That is so off trend.

20
00:01:07.706 --> 00:01:09.621
Ecru and slate, please.

21
00:01:09.795 --> 00:01:12.711
And don't bring up that pattern
sizing program of yours again.


22
00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.105
It's too expensive
and Gabriella doesn't care about


23
00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:17.237
anyone outside of
her target market.


24
00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:18.717
But it's--

25
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.154
Just don't, okay?
Know your audience.


26
00:01:23.548 --> 00:01:24.853
The items for
the fall line are here.


27
00:01:25.027 --> 00:01:28.118
These are going
to be so on trend!


28
00:01:28.292 --> 00:01:30.337
What kind of stitching is this?

29
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:31.556
Is this-- is this glue?

30
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.166
It's the latest thing.

31
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.603
It lowers the price
per item by two percent.


32
00:01:35.777 --> 00:01:38.693
Yeah, and it's awful.
There's barely any give.


33
00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:40.652
This one's already
falling apart.


34
00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:43.785
It's a minor flaw.
No one will notice.


35
00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.179
I don't think any of these are
going to last a dozen washings.


36
00:01:46.353 --> 00:01:50.052
Then we'll put
dry-clean only tags on them.


37
00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:52.403
Do we know how the chemicals
will react with the glue?


38
00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:54.666
Skye, it doesn't matter.

39
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.842
Trends don't last longer
than a season anyway.


40
00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.670
You know that.

41
00:01:58.844 --> 00:02:00.237
What about the people
who don't care about trends


42
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:02.195
and they really love this top?

43
00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.849
I mean, they're going to be
heartbroken when they can't


44
00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.764
wear it anymore.

45
00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:09.594
Well, I for one
do care about trends.


46
00:02:09.768 --> 00:02:12.423
Especially the one that
I've noticed in you, Skye.


47
00:02:12.597 --> 00:02:13.815
Me?

48
00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.687
Yes, you.

49
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:18.255
You seem incapable of
getting behind the Claw'd brand.


50
00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:22.084
I'm sorry. I didn't realize.

51
00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.087
It's just that

52
00:02:25.262 --> 00:02:28.090
fashion isn't about
how many units you can sell


53
00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:30.702
as fast as you can
no matter what.


54
00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:33.444
It's-
- It's about creativity

55
00:02:33.618 --> 00:02:36.664
and expression and joy.

56
00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:43.758
You got fired over a shirt?

57
00:02:43.932 --> 00:02:46.152
You know you'd never want
Froman's to sell something


58
00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:50.200
that poorly made,
no matter how trendy it was.


59
00:02:50.374 --> 00:02:51.505
So, what are you going to do?

60
00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:53.377
I don't know.

61
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:54.943
They're looking for a new
head buyer of women's apparel


62
00:02:55.117 --> 00:02:56.858
at Froman's.

63
00:02:57.032 --> 00:02:58.773
Maybe it's time that I really
try to start my own line.


64
00:02:58.947 --> 00:03:01.515
I've been dreaming
about it for years and--


65
00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:04.649
Wait. You're the head buyer
for women's apparel at Froman's.


66
00:03:04.823 --> 00:03:06.172
Not as of this morning.

67
00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:07.565
Your promotion
finally came through?


68
00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.131
You are now looking at the new

69
00:03:09.306 --> 00:03:11.438
Assistant Chief
Merchandising Officer


70
00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:12.874
of all apparel!

71
00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:14.572
That's amazing!

72
00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:17.705
I'm so happy for you.

73
00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:19.794
You have worked
so hard for this!


74
00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.974
So, is there something
you wanted to ask me?


75
00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:30.327
Of course.

76
00:03:32.416 --> 00:03:35.419
Would you like me to put
in a good word for you


77
00:03:35.593 --> 00:03:37.377
at my old job?

78
00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:40.815
Patrick, you've said so many
times that when you reached


79
00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.557
the next stage in your
career that you and I,


80
00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:44.776
we'd get engaged.

81
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.865
This isn't the next stage.

82
00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.477
I'm only the Assistant Chief
Merchandising Officer.


83
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:53.088
Oh.

84
00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:56.788
I just assumed because of
all of the times you've said--


85
00:03:56.962 --> 00:04:01.401
Skye, you're the most
amazing, talented,


86
00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:03.882
kind person I've ever met,
and I just want to make sure


87
00:04:04.056 --> 00:04:05.927
I'm in a place
where I deserve you.


88
00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:10.367
That's the exact same
speech you gave the last time


89
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:12.194
you put off our engagement.

90
00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:14.022
We're such a great couple.

91
00:04:14.196 --> 00:04:15.633
I just don't understand
why things have to change.


92
00:04:15.807 --> 00:04:18.592
Patrick, we've been
dating for five years.


93
00:04:18.766 --> 00:04:20.246
If we're not serious about this,

94
00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.075
then I don't think
I can do it anymore.


95
00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:26.557
You're breaking up with me?

96
00:04:26.731 --> 00:04:28.907
No, I'm not.

97
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:31.562
I just need some time and space

98
00:04:31.736 --> 00:04:34.260
to think about this.

99
00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:03.942
♪

100
00:05:08.903 --> 00:05:11.036
Amanda! Hi. Come on in.

101
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.952
Hi, Skye. There were a few
things left on your desk


102
00:05:14.126 --> 00:05:15.475
that I thought you would want.

103
00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:17.172
That's so sweet of you.

104
00:05:17.347 --> 00:05:19.827
And a cupcake,

105
00:05:20.001 --> 00:05:21.960
'cause, well, who doesn't
need a cupcake after?


106
00:05:22.134 --> 00:05:25.267
That's doubly sweet of you.

107
00:05:25.442 --> 00:05:28.923
Oh, what's this?

108
00:05:29.097 --> 00:05:30.708
It's a vision board
for the fashion line


109
00:05:30.882 --> 00:05:33.275
that I've always
wanted to start.


110
00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.103
That's my Grandma Maybelle.

111
00:05:35.277 --> 00:05:37.671
She taught me the three most
important C's of fashion.


112
00:05:37.845 --> 00:05:39.151
Which are?

113
00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:40.805
Color, connection,
and confidence.


114
00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:44.678
I'm going to base
my entire line around them.


115
00:05:44.852 --> 00:05:48.290
You're own line?
I don't know, Skye.


116
00:05:48.465 --> 00:05:51.163
It's really hard for unknown
lines to get off the ground.


117
00:05:51.337 --> 00:05:53.774
Almost impossible.

118
00:05:53.948 --> 00:05:55.646
I know it won't be easy,

119
00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.693
but it's just
always been my dream.


120
00:05:59.867 --> 00:06:03.044
I have a ton of
samples all ready.


121
00:06:04.306 --> 00:06:07.048
I'm going to figure out
a way to make it happen.


122
00:06:07.222 --> 00:06:09.399
Well, good luck.

123
00:06:15.535 --> 00:06:18.625
♪

124
00:06:18.799 --> 00:06:22.281
Maybelle is all about color,
confidence, and connection.


125
00:06:22.455 --> 00:06:24.370
Using high quality
fabrics and dyes,


126
00:06:24.544 --> 00:06:28.026
Maybelle clothes stay
looking their best for years.


127
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.376
That's right, I said years.

128
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.987
Hello? Hello?

129
00:06:34.467 --> 00:06:37.078
Well, I can't say
Amanda didn't warn me.


130
00:06:37.252 --> 00:06:40.778
But there's more than
one way to sew a seam.


131
00:06:46.392 --> 00:06:47.828
- Hi?
- Hey, Skye.


132
00:06:48.002 --> 00:06:49.830
- Patrick.
- Do you have a moment to talk?


133
00:06:50.004 --> 00:06:51.528
You know what? I going to need
a little more time before we


134
00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:53.007
talk about you and me and--

135
00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:54.226
I know! I know.
It's not about us.


136
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.357
It's about your clothing line.

137
00:06:55.532 --> 00:06:57.011
What about it?

138
00:06:57.185 --> 00:06:58.578
Well, I showed some of
the sketches you left at


139
00:06:58.752 --> 00:07:01.363
my place to my boss.
She loves them.


140
00:07:01.538 --> 00:07:03.365
Really?!

141
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.150
She thinks they'd make a great
capsule collection for Froman's.


142
00:07:05.324 --> 00:07:08.588
Patrick, that's wonderful,
but, you know, I don't know


143
00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:10.938
if I feel right with you
doing this for me when we're--


144
00:07:11.112 --> 00:07:13.332
My job is to bring
great clothes to my boss.


145
00:07:13.506 --> 00:07:16.030
- I'm just doing my job.
- Yeah, I don't know.


146
00:07:16.204 --> 00:07:18.032
You can't pass up
this opportunity.


147
00:07:18.206 --> 00:07:20.252
Your designs will be in hundreds
of stores across the country.


148
00:07:20.426 --> 00:07:23.690
Imagine how many people would
have access to your clothes!


149
00:07:23.864 --> 00:07:26.780
Yeah, in that case.

150
00:07:26.954 --> 00:07:28.434
If you're sure.

151
00:07:28.608 --> 00:07:30.915
I am!

152
00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:32.438
Okay. I'd love to.

153
00:07:32.612 --> 00:07:34.440
There is just--
There is just one thing.


154
00:07:34.614 --> 00:07:37.095
My boss. I need to prove to
her there's a consumer base


155
00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:38.488
for Maybelle clothes.

156
00:07:38.662 --> 00:07:40.446
What do you mean,
a consumer base?


157
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:42.448
You need to sell $10,000

159
00:07:44.406 --> 00:07:48.062
10,000? Okay, I'll figure
out a way to make it happen.


160
00:07:51.196 --> 00:07:54.286
Oh, I'm so sorry! Are you okay?

161
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:56.941
Did anybody get the license
plate on that rainbow?


162
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.293
Oh. Hi.

163
00:08:01.467 --> 00:08:03.817
Hi.

164
00:08:03.991 --> 00:08:05.776
Oh, my jacket!

165
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.605
I know how you feel.

166
00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:10.389
Oh, I'm so sorry!

167
00:08:10.563 --> 00:08:12.217
I got really distracted
there for a moment


168
00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.219
and I'm sorry about
the rainbow-- I mean, the rack!


169
00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:17.439
Please, let me clean this up
for you and I will have it back

171
00:08:18.876 --> 00:08:21.095
I'm not really-
- Okay.

172
00:08:21.269 --> 00:08:23.228
Here.

173
00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:24.969
Oh, wow.

174
00:08:25.143 --> 00:08:28.494
Yeah, I can never
get these things right.


175
00:08:28.668 --> 00:08:30.844
That's why I always
wear the jacket.


176
00:08:31.018 --> 00:08:32.237
Right, right.

177
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:33.978
Yeah.

178
00:08:34.152 --> 00:08:35.457
So, where do I bring the jacket?

179
00:08:35.632 --> 00:08:37.938
My what?

180
00:08:38.112 --> 00:08:39.636
The jacket?

181
00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:40.854
Right.

182
00:08:41.028 --> 00:08:42.639
Yes, of course, um...

184
00:08:48.296 --> 00:08:51.822
Well, Jason, I'm going to
get right on this stain.


185
00:08:51.996 --> 00:08:56.391
Don't want to let it set!

Hey, Jason!
Someone's here to see you!

Haven't you ever
heard of texting, Mo?

Hi.

210
00:10:52.507 --> 00:10:54.248
Oh, I brought your jacket back.

Oh, wow! That's amazing!

You must be the best
dry cleaner in town.


214
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:02.866
Oh, no. I'm not a dry cleaner.
I'm a fashion designer.


215
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:04.737
Really?

216

I don't suppose you'd be
willing to sell me your secret?


217
00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.306
I'm looking for
a new business start-up.


218
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.699
I just sold my last company.

219
00:11:09.873 --> 00:11:10.961
A dry cleaning company?

220
00:11:11.135 --> 00:11:12.484
No, underwater drones.

221
00:11:12.658 --> 00:11:14.704
Jason here is
a serial entrepreneur.


222
00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:15.966
Like cornflakes?

223
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.794
No.

224
00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:20.057
More like I build a company
up until it achieves value


225
00:11:20.231 --> 00:11:21.667
and then I sell it for a profit.

226
00:11:21.841 --> 00:11:23.060
Why would you let
go of a company just when


227
00:11:23.234 --> 00:11:25.279
it becomes valuable?

228
00:11:25.453 --> 00:11:27.673
That's how you
achieve a successful exit.


229

Is there any man not
terrified of commitment?

Oh, yeah.
There's even a word for them.

Married.

232

Don't be too
impressed with him, though.


233
00:11:36.856 --> 00:11:39.685
King Entrepreneur has at
least one dent in his crown.


234
00:11:39.859 --> 00:11:41.208
I thought we agreed
not to bring that up.


235
00:11:41.382 --> 00:11:42.819
Oh, no.
You agreed not to bring it up.


236
00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:44.646
I agreed to give
you room and board


237
00:11:44.821 --> 00:11:47.475
and in exchange tease you
about it as much as I like.


238
00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:52.350
Taco Burger?!

239
00:11:52.524 --> 00:11:54.308
What on earth is a taco burger?

240
00:11:54.482 --> 00:11:56.354
It was a taco in a burger.

241
00:11:56.528 --> 00:11:58.356
It was two all-time
favorites combined into one


242
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:00.097
simple yet elegant product.

243
00:12:00.271 --> 00:12:02.012
That looked and tasted
like a dog's dinner.


244
00:12:02.186 --> 00:12:04.884
He insisted on cooking even
though he can barely boil water.


245
00:12:05.058 --> 00:12:06.581
It's my one failure.

246
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.892
I bet there's a market
for a mobile dry cleaners.


247
00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.502
Sure you won't reconsider?
We could go 50/50.


248
00:12:14.676 --> 00:12:16.591
Oh, no, I'm actually
starting my own business.


249
00:12:16.766 --> 00:12:18.028
Working on it.

250
00:12:18.202 --> 00:12:20.073
It's a fashion line
called Maybelle.


251
00:12:20.247 --> 00:12:22.902
I just need to sell $10,000 in
clothes and then I get my own


252
00:12:23.076 --> 00:12:24.382
line in a major
department store.


253
00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:26.079
That's easy enough.

254
00:12:26.253 --> 00:12:27.428
You set up an online
store in under an hour.


255
00:12:27.602 --> 00:12:28.821
Absolutely not!

256
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:34.261
You can't feel the way
clothes lay on your skin online.


257
00:12:34.435 --> 00:12:36.655
Or the way a color
makes your skin glow.


258
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:39.397
Or how you stand a little
bit taller when you find


259
00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:42.226
that perfect thing just for you.

260
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.184
Online is great
for a lot of things,


261
00:12:44.358 --> 00:12:46.143
but not my clothes.

262
00:12:46.317 --> 00:12:49.624
But I'm still trying to find
a way to get them to people.


263
00:12:51.931 --> 00:12:53.715
Isn't that ironic.

264
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.196
You have stuff to sell
and no way to get it to people,


265
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:59.896
and you have a way to get stuff
to people and nothing to sell.


266
00:13:02.202 --> 00:13:03.856
That's ridiculous.

267
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.553
That's crazy.

268
00:13:09.906 --> 00:13:11.777
A mobile boutique?

269
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:14.040
The overhead would be a lot
less than a traditional store.


270
00:13:14.214 --> 00:13:16.521
No. It's a really bad idea.

271
00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.175
Why not?

272
00:13:18.349 --> 00:13:20.133
Because it's just not
the way things are done.


273
00:13:20.307 --> 00:13:21.439
You just said you gotta
start thinking outside the box.

He means inside the truck.

275

What? This turkey of a truck?

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.979
Before that it was remote
team-building software.


317
00:15:50.153 --> 00:15:52.459
And before that it was daffodils
that bloomed year round.


318
00:15:52.633 --> 00:15:54.984
I Googled you.

319
00:15:55.158 --> 00:15:57.769
I'm flattered, but if you came
back here because you changed


320
00:15:57.943 --> 00:16:00.032
your mind,
I'm not interested any more.


321
00:16:00.206 --> 00:16:01.686
Why not?

322
00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.644
You know nothing about
starting a business.


323
00:16:03.818 --> 00:16:05.907
You know nothing about fashion,
but you never let that stop you.


324
00:16:06.082 --> 00:16:09.607
Okay. Here's the deal.

325
00:16:09.781 --> 00:16:12.218
You're the supplier,
I'm the retailer.


326
00:16:12.392 --> 00:16:13.959
You bring me the goods,
I take them out,


327
00:16:14.133 --> 00:16:16.179
I bring back the money.
We split the profits.


328
00:16:16.353 --> 00:16:18.398
If you think that I'm just
going to hand over my samples,


329
00:16:18.572 --> 00:16:20.009
close my eyes,
and cross my fingers,


330
00:16:20.183 --> 00:16:21.445
then you're crazier
than a taco burger.


331
00:16:21.619 --> 00:16:23.447
Take it or leave it.

332
00:16:23.621 --> 00:16:25.014
Don't you think it would have
been more successful if you


333
00:16:25.188 --> 00:16:27.886
would have hired an actual chef?

334
00:16:31.455 --> 00:16:33.631
Entrepreneurial rule number #3.

335
00:16:33.805 --> 00:16:35.415
Learn from your mistakes.

336
00:16:35.589 --> 00:16:37.287
What are you talking about?

337
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:38.549
It's one of the nine great
rules of entrepreneurship.


338
00:16:38.723 --> 00:16:40.246
According to who?

339
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:41.943
Me.

340
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:45.469
You should be on the truck.

341
00:16:45.643 --> 00:16:47.123
- Deal.
- Deal.


342
00:16:49.125 --> 00:16:50.126
How soon can you start?

343
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:51.823
Now!

344
00:17:03.008 --> 00:17:04.488
So, the parts
I need for the truck


345
00:17:04.662 --> 00:17:06.620
should be in tomorrow.

346
00:17:06.794 --> 00:17:07.795
Hey, are you guys hungry?

347
00:17:07.969 --> 00:17:09.319
Starved.

348
00:17:09.493 --> 00:17:11.103
Great. Jason,
you make a pupusa run.


349
00:17:11.277 --> 00:17:12.278
You fly, I'll buy.

350
00:17:12.452 --> 00:17:15.064
Little busy. You fly, I'll buy.

351
00:17:15.238 --> 00:17:16.326
Hey, Skye.

352
00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.327
Yeah?

353
00:17:17.501 --> 00:17:19.155
Nice job.

354
00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:21.287
You know what? I'll just wait
until you guys are done.


355
00:17:21.461 --> 00:17:22.680
It's just pupusas.

356
00:17:22.854 --> 00:17:23.855
Yeah, I'm actually
not that hungry.


357
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.986
I am.

358
00:17:25.161 --> 00:17:26.466
It'll just take a mo', Mo.

359
00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:28.077
You know what?
I'll order Chinese.


360
00:17:31.471 --> 00:17:33.299
What was that all about?

361
00:17:33.473 --> 00:17:35.519
Mo's had a crush for months
on the chef who runs the best


362
00:17:35.693 --> 00:17:37.782
pupusa place in Brooklyn.

363
00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:39.262
But she's too shy
to even go near it,


364
00:17:39.436 --> 00:17:41.090
much less ask Angel for a date.

365
00:17:41.264 --> 00:17:43.135
Aw, but Mo's so great!

366
00:17:43.309 --> 00:17:45.355
She shouldn't be shy
about something like that.


367
00:17:45.529 --> 00:17:47.226
You really think so?

368
00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.750
Yeah. I mean, you gotta
get past the engine grease.


369
00:17:49.924 --> 00:17:54.494
But she's obviously
smart and caring.


370
00:17:54.668 --> 00:17:56.714
She's giving us such
a deal on the repairs,


371
00:17:56.888 --> 00:18:00.239
I would love to do
something special for her.


372
00:18:01.893 --> 00:18:03.634
I can give her
a wardrobe makeover!


373
00:18:04.765 --> 00:18:07.551
I have plenty of
samples in her size.


374
00:18:07.725 --> 00:18:09.422
How is that going to help her?

375
00:18:09.596 --> 00:18:10.728
Angel won't like her more
just because she's wearing


376
00:18:10.902 --> 00:18:12.382
a different pair of jeans.

377
00:18:12.556 --> 00:18:14.993
Of course, but it's
all about one of the C's.


378
00:18:16.603 --> 00:18:18.170
Confidence.

379
00:18:18.344 --> 00:18:20.129
Good clothes, and clothes
that are right for you,


380
00:18:20.303 --> 00:18:22.957
can make a huge difference
in how you feel about yourself.


381
00:18:23.132 --> 00:18:25.134
And then the whole
world can see that you feel


382
00:18:25.308 --> 00:18:26.744
as good as you look.

383
00:18:26.918 --> 00:18:28.833
Ow!

384
00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:31.923
Something tells me right now,
you look better than you feel.


385
00:18:37.755 --> 00:18:39.148
Almost.

386
00:18:43.152 --> 00:18:44.196
Now?

387
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:45.893
Just about.

388
00:18:47.373 --> 00:18:48.244
And...

389
00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:50.420
Done!

390
00:18:50.594 --> 00:18:52.248
- Okay.
- Okay, ready?


391
00:18:52.422 --> 00:18:53.945
Yeah.

392
00:18:58.471 --> 00:19:00.169
Oh.

393
00:19:05.652 --> 00:19:07.088
Oh, it looks good.

394
00:19:07.263 --> 00:19:08.786
It's perfect.

395
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.877
It just needs one more thing.

396
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:16.141
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't you dare!


397
00:19:16.315 --> 00:19:19.100
You wouldn't!

398
00:19:19.275 --> 00:19:21.277
I'm just kidding.

399
00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:22.452
Or am I?

400
00:19:23.844 --> 00:19:25.194
It's perfect.

401
00:19:25.368 --> 00:19:26.760
I kinda love it.

402
00:19:28.327 --> 00:19:29.720
Yeah.

403
00:19:37.249 --> 00:19:38.816
We should get these puppies
loaded up for the morning.


404
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.079
Yeah. Oh, you've got
paint all over your hands!


405
00:19:43.951 --> 00:19:45.518
So do you.

406
00:19:45.692 --> 00:19:47.564
Oh.

407
00:19:47.738 --> 00:19:49.566
It's not coming off.

408
00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.308
Don't worry. I know where Mo
keeps the heavy duty cleaners.


409
00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:54.745
Great.

410
00:19:54.919 --> 00:19:56.137
Come on.

411
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:03.884
It's not coming off.

412
00:20:06.147 --> 00:20:07.801
Here.

413
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:19.150
♪

414
00:20:26.472 --> 00:20:28.387
Hello? Skye?

415
00:20:28.561 --> 00:20:29.867
Hi. Who are you?

416
00:20:30.041 --> 00:20:32.348
I'm Patrick.
I'm Skye's boyfriend.


417
00:20:32.522 --> 00:20:34.915
Oh. Hi.

418
00:20:35.089 --> 00:20:36.743
I didn't realize
Skye had a boyfriend.


419
00:20:36.917 --> 00:20:38.136
Patrick,
what are you doing here?


420
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:40.312
I saw ShareZees posts.

421
00:20:40.486 --> 00:20:42.271
Ah, right. Those.

422
00:20:42.445 --> 00:20:44.011
You seemed so excited
about the mobile boutique


423
00:20:44.185 --> 00:20:45.491
I thought I'd come
check it out.


424
00:20:45.665 --> 00:20:47.363
And I brought dinner.

425
00:20:47.537 --> 00:20:49.365
I don't know if there's
enough for everyone though.


426
00:20:49.539 --> 00:20:52.542
Oh, that's okay. I promised
Mo I'd go pick up pupusas.


427
00:20:52.716 --> 00:20:54.152
Jason, are you sure?

428
00:20:54.326 --> 00:20:56.067
Yeah. I'll see you
first thing tomorrow.


429
00:20:56.241 --> 00:20:58.069
Nice to meet you.

430
00:20:58.243 --> 00:21:01.725
So, let's check this truck out!

431
00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.858
Skye: It's pretty great, right?

432
00:21:05.032 --> 00:21:07.557
Patrick: I don't know, Skye.
It seems a little disruptive.


433
00:21:07.731 --> 00:21:09.210
Disruptive?

434
00:21:09.385 --> 00:21:10.777
I don't know what
Froman's is going to think.


435
00:21:10.951 --> 00:21:12.779
You know,
they're very mainstream.


436
00:21:12.953 --> 00:21:15.478
I mean, I have to sell
my clothes some way.


437
00:21:15.652 --> 00:21:17.175
There's always online.

438
00:21:17.349 --> 00:21:20.439
I know. I know.
Touch, feel, fit, etcetera.


439
00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:22.572
How is this going to
get you ShareZees followers?


440
00:21:22.746 --> 00:21:24.661
I'm--
I'm still working on that part.


441
00:21:24.835 --> 00:21:26.532
Well, work quickly.
Remember what I said.


442
00:21:26.706 --> 00:21:29.056
You got to start following
people, tag other brands.


443
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.841
Yup.

444
00:21:31.015 --> 00:21:33.147
Skye, this is serious.
Tomorrow is Follow Friday.


445
00:21:33.322 --> 00:21:36.063
I know. I know,
and I am taking it seriously.


446
00:21:36.237 --> 00:21:38.936
I was up all night last night
thinking of creative hashtags.


447
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.633
Good. Great. Just think of
social media as the world's


448
00:21:40.807 --> 00:21:43.070
biggest runway. 
Enough hiding.

449
00:21:43.244 --> 00:21:46.073
It's time to explode your brand.

450
00:21:46.247 --> 00:21:48.946
Hashtag be bold.

451
00:21:55.082 --> 00:21:57.258
Hashtag disaster.

452
00:22:06.006 --> 00:22:09.793
Entrepreneurial rule #2.
On time is good.


453
00:22:09.967 --> 00:22:12.578
Early is better
and it comes with coffee!


454
00:22:12.752 --> 00:22:13.797
Thank you.

455
00:22:13.971 --> 00:22:14.798
You ready to do this?

456
00:22:14.972 --> 00:22:17.322
Let's go.

457
00:22:17.496 --> 00:22:19.368
- Oh, sorry.
- Sorry.


458
00:22:19.542 --> 00:22:21.500
I thought you'd drive
since it's your truck.


459
00:22:21.674 --> 00:22:23.894
Well, I thought you'd drive so
I could strategize on the road.


460
00:22:24.068 --> 00:22:25.548
You can't drive and strategize?

461
00:22:25.722 --> 00:22:27.158
You can't drive a truck?

462
00:22:27.332 --> 00:22:30.640
I can't drive
manual transmission.


463
00:22:30.814 --> 00:22:32.729
Well, that won't do.

464
00:22:32.903 --> 00:22:35.122
We've got time. 
I'll teach you.

465
00:22:35.296 --> 00:22:36.646
It'll be fun.

466
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.430
You told me this was easy.

467
00:22:38.604 --> 00:22:40.301
Try again. Tenth--

468
00:22:40.476 --> 00:22:41.520
Eleventh.

469
00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:44.001
Eleventh time is a charm.

470
00:22:45.742 --> 00:22:46.786
Okay.

471
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.049
Foot on the brake.

472
00:22:49.223 --> 00:22:50.834
- Push in the clutch.
- Push in the clutch.


473
00:22:51.008 --> 00:22:53.619
Put it in neutral.

474
00:22:53.793 --> 00:22:54.794
Let out the clutch.

475
00:22:54.968 --> 00:22:55.882
Let out
the clutch.


476
00:22:56.056 --> 00:22:58.407

First.

00:23:06.197 --> 00:23:10.636
Now, let out the clutch slowly

483
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:11.985
and push on the gas.

484

00:30:35.515 --> 00:30:37.953
Yup! Remember when
I said it would just be easier


638
00:30:38.127 --> 00:30:39.650
to say yes to me?

639
00:30:41.391 --> 00:30:44.655
Angel's wonderful.

640
00:30:47.005 --> 00:30:49.355
He's kind and funny

641
00:30:49.529 --> 00:30:51.749
and he's got these gorgeous eyes

642
00:30:51.923 --> 00:30:55.492
and he's just wonderful.

643
00:30:56.972 --> 00:30:58.321
So, what's the problem?

644
00:30:58.495 --> 00:31:00.149
Why don't you
ask him out on a date?


645
00:31:00.323 --> 00:31:02.716
Isn't this girl talk thing
supposed to work both ways?


646
00:31:02.891 --> 00:31:05.763
Tell me about your boyfriend.
Jason said he stopped by.


647
00:31:05.937 --> 00:31:09.201
Patrick and I
are taking some space.


648
00:31:09.375 --> 00:31:11.334
Not how Jason made it sound.

649
00:31:11.508 --> 00:31:13.597
Well, we are.

650
00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:17.296
Patrick's great but he keeps
saying he doesn't want to get


651
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.778
engaged because he has to hit
this milestone or that one,


652
00:31:20.952 --> 00:31:24.564
and then he does
and somehow there's always


653
00:31:24.738 --> 00:31:28.917
another milestone instead
of the other kind of stone.


654
00:31:30.483 --> 00:31:32.659
Wow, is there
something about you


655
00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:36.185
that just attracts
commitment-phobes?


656
00:31:36.359 --> 00:31:37.838
What do you mean?

657
00:31:38.013 --> 00:31:39.536
Jason, of course!

658
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:43.105
I don't attract Jason.

659
00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:44.323
Mm-hm.

660
00:31:44.497 --> 00:31:45.759
He's just my business partner.

661
00:31:45.934 --> 00:31:47.544
Well, good for you.

662
00:31:47.718 --> 00:31:49.676
He's never been one
to commit to anything.


663
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:52.288
Not his startups.
Not his girlfriends.


664
00:31:52.462 --> 00:31:54.159
Not even a cell phone carrier.

665
00:31:54.333 --> 00:31:57.380
He calls it
strategic vision, but--


666
00:31:57.554 --> 00:32:01.123
Whoa! Wait! What is this?

667
00:32:02.776 --> 00:32:04.343
Nothing.

668
00:32:04.517 --> 00:32:06.215
It's not that bad.
It's a little out of date,


669
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:10.393
but the color is gorgeous
and the cut is perfect for you.


670
00:32:10.567 --> 00:32:13.309
What made you hold
onto it this long?


671
00:32:14.397 --> 00:32:16.181
I told you.

672
00:32:16.355 --> 00:32:19.750
It's just easier to shove things
away and forget about them.


673
00:32:23.623 --> 00:32:25.321
You will take my advice
about Jason, though, right?


674
00:32:25.495 --> 00:32:28.063
I love my brother,
but he's not the type to


675
00:32:28.237 --> 00:32:30.021
settle down for anything.

676
00:32:30.195 --> 00:32:33.068
Ha! Believe me, that is
the last thing I need right now.

678
00:32:47.952 --> 00:32:50.085
Well, at least it's not
a safety hazard anymore.


679
00:32:50.259 --> 00:32:51.825
How's this makeover going?

680
00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.698
Oh, and you said I know
nothing about fashion?


681
00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:57.614
You have to make room
before you can makeover!


682
00:32:57.788 --> 00:32:59.268
It turns out my closet
was full of clothes


683
00:32:59.442 --> 00:33:00.747
that I never wear anymore.

684
00:33:00.921 --> 00:33:02.532
I'll donate them in the morning.

685
00:33:09.234 --> 00:33:10.583
Dare I ask?

686
00:33:10.757 --> 00:33:12.107
Better you didn't.

687
00:33:24.119 --> 00:33:25.120
Jason: Hey, guys. 
How you doing?

688
00:33:25.294 --> 00:33:26.121
Skye: Hi, guys.

689
00:33:26.295 --> 00:33:28.123
Jason: Alright.

690
00:33:28.297 --> 00:33:29.211
Hi.

Hi, how are you today?

692
00:33:33.128 --> 00:33:33.954
Hi, guys.

693
00:33:34.129 --> 00:33:36.479
Hi there. Hi.

694
00:33:42.572 --> 00:33:44.661
The phone service
is way better here.


695
00:33:44.835 --> 00:33:47.707
But the foot traffic is worse.
No one knows we're here!


696
00:33:47.881 --> 00:33:49.666
Well, don't worry.
I dropped a pin


697
00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:51.668
and I made up these
flyers with a map.


698
00:33:51.842 --> 00:33:54.105
Every day we can mark our
location and hand them out.


699
00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:56.194
That's brilliant, but who's
going to hand them out?


700
00:33:56.368 --> 00:33:59.110
I am.

701
00:33:59.284 --> 00:34:01.069
I know, but they're just flyers.

702
00:34:01.243 --> 00:34:05.073
Okay, you wait here
and get ready for customers.

I thought I'd come by

It's not too late

No, we're fine.
We're doing great.

We're just trying

You can see them
three streets away.

How'd it go with the flyers?

714
00:34:58.561 --> 00:35:00.084
Oh. It was okay.

715

I got something
that can actually help.


716
00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.871
So, I had the advertising
team do some research,


717
00:35:05.045 --> 00:35:08.397
and this tested extremely
well in the 15 to 20 age range


718
00:35:08.571 --> 00:35:12.009
and they rated it
highly recognizable.


719
00:35:12.183 --> 00:35:14.881
Yeah, from space.

720

Patrick, that's really
thoughtful of you but--


721
00:35:17.275 --> 00:35:19.059
And you know what else?
I actually know somebody who

works for Mary B.
His name's Harry,


723
00:35:20.626 --> 00:35:22.150
and I think I can
give him a call.


724
00:35:22.324 --> 00:35:24.064
It'd be really great.
You can use that contact.


725
00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:28.112
Um, I feel really uncomfortable
with you helping me out so much

So, should we go here?

Hi, Maybelle on Wheels.
We're a mobile boutique.


734
00:35:49.264 --> 00:35:51.004
High fashion store.

735
00:35:51.179 --> 00:35:53.442
Hi, would you like your

Hey, guys. How you doing?
This is Maybelle on Wheels.


738
00:35:58.186 --> 00:36:00.144
The map's here. Yeah, she'll be
in Greenwich tomorrow,


739
00:36:00.318 --> 00:36:02.973
she'll be in Hoboken. Yeah.
She designed this, for sure.


740
00:36:03.147 --> 00:36:05.976
She's going to be at
the Rockefeller Center.


741

You guys want to pass
these to your friends?

It's Maybelle on Wheels.
Yeah. Thank you.


744
00:36:12.635 --> 00:36:14.680
I appreciate that.
How you doing?


745
00:36:17.944 --> 00:36:20.164
Oh, come on.

746
00:36:20.338 --> 00:36:22.297
They are not that bad.

747
00:36:22.471 --> 00:36:25.822
Then why did you
ask for my help?


748
00:36:25.996 --> 00:36:29.304
They're not bad.
They're just boring.


749
00:36:29.478 --> 00:36:31.393
Well, fuchsia isn't my color.

750
00:36:31.567 --> 00:36:35.005
Apparently,
color isn't your color.


751
00:36:35.179 --> 00:36:36.398
I like to keep things simple.

752
00:36:36.572 --> 00:36:38.835
You like to keep things safe,

753
00:36:39.009 --> 00:36:41.185
and fashion's not
about being safe.


754
00:36:41.359 --> 00:36:42.752
I thought you said
it's about being yourself.


755
00:36:42.926 --> 00:36:45.058
Exactly. It's about showing up

756
00:36:45.233 --> 00:36:46.843
and not being afraid
to tell the world,


757
00:36:47.017 --> 00:36:50.803
"Here I am! This is me!"

758
00:36:50.977 --> 00:36:52.631
You think that
doesn't take courage?


759
00:36:52.805 --> 00:36:55.286
Here, and this.

760
00:36:57.462 --> 00:36:58.768
Oh, come on.

761
00:36:58.942 --> 00:37:00.596
You're willing to
take a risk on the great


762
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:04.208
Taco Burger experiment
and not on electric cobalt?


763
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:15.132
Good day together, huh?

764
00:37:15.306 --> 00:37:17.003
Go teamwork.

765
00:37:17.177 --> 00:37:18.353
I guess you can call it that.

766
00:37:18.527 --> 00:37:20.355
What's that supposed to mean?

767
00:37:20.529 --> 00:37:24.576
I mean, why didn't you tell
Patrick his logo was terrible?


768
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.317
It wasn't terrible!

769
00:37:28.014 --> 00:37:31.670
It wasn't terrible if you're
opening a laser tag facility.


770
00:37:34.064 --> 00:37:35.892
Do we have to do this now?

771
00:37:36.066 --> 00:37:37.807
It completes the look!

772
00:37:41.419 --> 00:37:45.597
That logo was terrible
for Maybelle and for you.


773
00:37:45.771 --> 00:37:47.251
You don't see that?

774
00:37:51.211 --> 00:37:52.387
Be a team player.

775
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:54.345
Whose team?

776
00:37:54.519 --> 00:37:57.783
Because whatever team that
logo's for, you weren't on it.


777
00:37:57.957 --> 00:37:59.742
Did you just ask me to
help you with your clothes


778
00:37:59.916 --> 00:38:02.222
because of Patrick?

779
00:38:02.397 --> 00:38:04.616
No.

780
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:06.531
Yes.

781
00:38:06.705 --> 00:38:09.926
I mean, he showed me what
a difference it can make.


782
00:38:11.188 --> 00:38:12.450
If we're going to
be on the same team


783
00:38:12.624 --> 00:38:14.060
I better wear the uniform,
right?


784
00:38:15.888 --> 00:38:17.412
It does look good.

785
00:38:25.594 --> 00:38:26.595
Wow.

786
00:38:26.769 --> 00:38:28.423
Mm-hm.

787
00:38:31.251 --> 00:38:32.514
It's still
missing something though.


788
00:38:32.688 --> 00:38:34.342
What?

789
00:38:38.824 --> 00:38:41.653
Hey! Hey!

790
00:38:41.827 --> 00:38:43.176
You're going to mess it up!

791
00:38:43.351 --> 00:38:45.178
That is impossible!
You already did.


792
00:38:45.353 --> 00:38:47.224
Just let me.

793
00:38:56.581 --> 00:38:58.061
I-
- I should go.

794
00:38:58.235 --> 00:39:00.063
Right.

795
00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:01.978
Yeah. I told Mo that I was going
to meet her back at my place.


796
00:39:02.152 --> 00:39:03.675
- So, yeah.
- Yeah. Of course.


797
00:39:03.849 --> 00:39:05.329
So, yeah.

798
00:39:05.503 --> 00:39:06.635
If you ever need a reference.

799
00:39:06.809 --> 00:39:08.463
I know who to tell them to call.

800
00:39:10.116 --> 00:39:20.116
♪

801
00:39:22.085 --> 00:39:24.000
We're going to
try an experiment.


802
00:39:24.174 --> 00:39:25.436
I don't like this already.

803
00:39:25.610 --> 00:39:27.003
You are going to
try on some things,


804
00:39:27.177 --> 00:39:29.135
but you can't see
what they look like first.


805
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:30.876
Why not?

806
00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:32.835
Because most people
have no idea what actually


807
00:39:33.009 --> 00:39:34.837
looks good on them. It's true.

808
00:39:35.011 --> 00:39:37.187
They get some idea
or rule in their head


809
00:39:37.361 --> 00:39:39.276
and then they never
question it again.


810
00:39:39.450 --> 00:39:41.321
They have to wear trends
or they can't wear trends


811
00:39:41.496 --> 00:39:44.020
or they have to wear
these colors and those styles,


812
00:39:44.194 --> 00:39:46.370
but none of that matters.

813
00:39:46.544 --> 00:39:49.199
The only thing that matters
is when you put the clothes on,


814
00:39:49.373 --> 00:39:52.158
they make you feel your best.

815
00:39:52.332 --> 00:39:54.204
Here, put this on.

816
00:39:56.075 --> 00:39:57.686
Why am I doing this again?

817
00:39:57.860 --> 00:39:59.383
Because clothes
make connections.


818
00:39:59.557 --> 00:40:01.385
They're a shorthand that
allow us to communicate


819
00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:04.867
with each other, and it's
just easier than fighting me.


820
00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:09.132
Okay.

821
00:40:12.091 --> 00:40:13.441
Top off.

822
00:40:15.704 --> 00:40:18.184
Here. One arm in.

823
00:40:19.011 --> 00:40:20.448
There you go.

824
00:40:22.537 --> 00:40:23.842
So, you never did tell me why

825
00:40:24.016 --> 00:40:25.931
you wouldn't ask
Angel out on a date.


826
00:40:27.063 --> 00:40:29.500
Now?
You really want to do this now?


827
00:40:29.674 --> 00:40:30.806
Yup.

828
00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.764
I don't know.

829
00:40:32.938 --> 00:40:34.418
I just...

830
00:40:34.592 --> 00:40:37.073
Angel wouldn't want
to date someone like me.


831
00:40:37.247 --> 00:40:39.554
Right, because smart,
competent, caring women


832
00:40:39.728 --> 00:40:41.251
are so unattractive.

833
00:40:42.557 --> 00:40:44.384
Don't look yet.

834
00:40:44.559 --> 00:40:48.258
First, I want you to
know how it feels.


835
00:40:48.432 --> 00:40:50.956
I thought fashion was supposed
to be all about how you look.


836
00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.392
Sometimes, but it shouldn't be.

837
00:40:52.567 --> 00:40:56.440
It should be about how you feel.

838
00:40:56.614 --> 00:40:58.790
You don't stare into
a mirror all day long,


839
00:40:58.964 --> 00:41:00.400
but you do feel the clothes

840
00:41:00.575 --> 00:41:02.402
against your skin
the whole time.


841
00:41:02.577 --> 00:41:03.621
So, how does it feel?

842
00:41:03.795 --> 00:41:05.057
A little tight in the shoulders.

843
00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:06.755
Enough said. Take it off.

844
00:41:06.929 --> 00:41:08.234
I'm not even gonna look at it?

845
00:41:08.408 --> 00:41:10.454
Why?
If you're never gonna wear it,


846
00:41:10.628 --> 00:41:12.151
then what do you care
what it looks like?


847
00:41:12.325 --> 00:41:13.892
Hmm.

848
00:41:14.066 --> 00:41:17.983
Ahh. Yeah, this one next.

849
00:41:19.332 --> 00:41:21.900
Oh, no.
Way too scratchy already.


850
00:41:22.074 --> 00:41:23.511
Got it. Next.

851
00:41:25.991 --> 00:41:27.384
Try this one.

852
00:41:27.558 --> 00:41:28.646
Ooh.

853
00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:31.301
- Yeah?
- Stretchy.


854
00:41:31.475 --> 00:41:32.520
Huh.

855
00:41:32.694 --> 00:41:33.738
So?

856
00:41:33.912 --> 00:41:35.784
What do you think?

857
00:41:35.958 --> 00:41:38.613
This is actually

858
00:41:38.787 --> 00:41:39.831
not too bad.

859
00:41:40.005 --> 00:41:42.486
Great.

860
00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.053
Hmm...

861
00:41:44.227 --> 00:41:47.447
Don't look yet.
There's one more part.


862
00:41:50.973 --> 00:41:52.888
Stand up, please.

863
00:41:53.758 --> 00:41:55.238
Arm out.

864
00:41:59.024 --> 00:42:00.765
How does this feel?

865
00:42:00.939 --> 00:42:02.985
Oh, like butter.

866
00:42:03.159 --> 00:42:04.856
Now, we're talkin'.

867
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:06.641
Take a look.

868
00:42:11.167 --> 00:42:12.647
What do you think?

869
00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:16.259
I love it.

870
00:42:18.478 --> 00:42:20.002
Hmm.

871
00:42:20.176 --> 00:42:21.656
Yeah.

872
00:42:25.268 --> 00:42:27.009
Both dresses
are gorgeous. Decide.


873
00:42:27.183 --> 00:42:29.751
Based on comfort, which
dress can you see yourself...


874
00:42:29.925 --> 00:42:31.404
Uh, excuse me?

875
00:42:31.579 --> 00:42:32.971
...just dancing around
the living room in?


876
00:42:33.145 --> 00:42:34.843
Excuse me?
I just want to pay for this.


877
00:42:35.017 --> 00:42:36.496
I'll be right with you, sir.

878
00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.499
I don't know. Flip a coin?

879
00:42:39.674 --> 00:42:40.675
Wait, wait, wait!

880
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:42.067
No. Please, wait one second.

881
00:42:42.241 --> 00:42:46.245
It'll just be another moment.

882
00:42:46.419 --> 00:42:47.812
You have got to let me help you.

883
00:42:47.986 --> 00:42:49.422
You know nothing about--

884
00:42:49.597 --> 00:42:51.337
Yeah, yeah, I know
nothing about fashion,


885
00:42:51.511 --> 00:42:54.297
but I can run a credit card
machine as well as anybody.


886
00:42:56.473 --> 00:43:00.695
Thank you.
Hi. I can help you right here.


887
00:43:00.869 --> 00:43:01.913
Perfect.
What a beautiful choice.


888
00:43:02.087 --> 00:43:03.306
Okay, what do you think?

889
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.481
Okay...

890
00:43:04.655 --> 00:43:06.048
Look at the colors on that.

891
00:43:08.354 --> 00:43:09.660
- Excuse me.
- Skye: Hi.


892
00:43:09.834 --> 00:43:11.575
Do you have this top
in a larger size?


893
00:43:11.749 --> 00:43:13.882
Oh, unfortunately all of our
garments are one of a kind.


894
00:43:14.056 --> 00:43:15.100
Oh.

895
00:43:15.274 --> 00:43:17.581
Well, I'll take this one anyway.

896
00:43:17.755 --> 00:43:19.104
Great. I'll just
ring that up for you.


897
00:43:19.278 --> 00:43:22.020
But have you tried it on?
How does it fit?


898
00:43:22.194 --> 00:43:25.589
It was great.
Um, maybe a little snug.


899
00:43:25.763 --> 00:43:28.461
But it's such a pretty top.
I have to have it.


900
00:43:28.636 --> 00:43:30.855
And have it you shall.
Will that be cash or credit?


901
00:43:31.029 --> 00:43:32.291
Why would you want
to buy something


902
00:43:32.465 --> 00:43:33.641
that doesn't
fit you quite right?


903
00:43:34.729 --> 00:43:35.991
I don't know.

904
00:43:36.165 --> 00:43:39.211
I thought it might someday.

905
00:43:39.385 --> 00:43:40.560
It could expand in the wash.

906
00:43:40.735 --> 00:43:41.779
That's not a thing.

907
00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:42.998
Excuse us for just a second.

908
00:43:43.172 --> 00:43:44.869
Sure.

909
00:43:45.043 --> 00:43:46.175
I might have missed something,
but are you seriously


910
00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:47.785
trying to talk us
out of a sale?


911
00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:49.657
I started Maybelle
because I want my clients


912
00:43:49.831 --> 00:43:51.920
to have beautiful,
well-made clothes


913
00:43:52.094 --> 00:43:53.530
that are perfect for them,

914
00:43:53.704 --> 00:43:55.314
and they can't be perfect
if they don't fit!


915
00:43:55.488 --> 00:43:56.794
Who cares, if owning
it gives her joy?


916
00:43:56.968 --> 00:43:58.796
But it's not
going to give her joy.


917
00:43:58.970 --> 00:44:01.886
Every time she opens her
closet and sees that top,


918
00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.627
she's gonna feel sad

919
00:44:03.801 --> 00:44:05.498
because it's beautiful
and she loves it


920
00:44:05.673 --> 00:44:07.587
and she's never gonna
be able to wear it.


921
00:44:07.762 --> 00:44:09.067
There's no joy in that.

922
00:44:10.286 --> 00:44:11.983
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

923
00:44:12.157 --> 00:44:14.551
What are you doing?

924
00:44:14.725 --> 00:44:16.945
I'm thinking.

925
00:44:17.119 --> 00:44:18.337
It looks really painful.

926
00:44:18.511 --> 00:44:20.122
Rule #6.

927
00:44:20.296 --> 00:44:22.690
What's rule #6?

928
00:44:22.864 --> 00:44:25.127
Find a way to "yes."

929
00:44:28.826 --> 00:44:31.307
Is that shirt part
of the computerized


930
00:44:31.481 --> 00:44:33.265
sizing program you're
always talking about?


931
00:44:33.439 --> 00:44:35.398
Yes.

932
00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:37.835
My second start-up
was a 3D modelling app.


933
00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:39.315
The programmer still
owes me a favor,


934
00:44:39.489 --> 00:44:42.231
one big enough for a rush job.

935
00:44:43.319 --> 00:44:44.842
Hi. Can I borrow
that for one second?


936
00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:46.061
Customer: Sure.

937
00:44:46.235 --> 00:44:48.324
Thank you.

938
00:44:53.198 --> 00:44:55.984
So, we combine Skye's
pattern sizing program


939
00:44:56.158 --> 00:44:57.942
with a 3D modelling app.

940
00:44:58.116 --> 00:45:00.771
We can show you exactly what
that top would look like on you.


941
00:45:01.816 --> 00:45:02.817
There we go.

942
00:45:05.167 --> 00:45:06.690
Skye: And then,
the program extrapolates


943
00:45:06.864 --> 00:45:09.475
the pattern to fit
your custom measurements.


944
00:45:09.649 --> 00:45:12.174
And we'll have your custom-made,
perfectly fitting top


945
00:45:12.348 --> 00:45:13.523
ready for you next week.

946
00:45:13.697 --> 00:45:15.830
Yeah.

947
00:45:16.004 --> 00:45:17.701
Great.

948
00:45:24.839 --> 00:45:27.406
And...

949
00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.583
...that is the grand
total for the day.


950
00:45:30.758 --> 00:45:32.237
What?

951
00:45:32.411 --> 00:45:34.762
This is our best day by far.
At this rate--


952
00:45:34.936 --> 00:45:38.026
We won't have enough
followers for another ten years.


953
00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.201
I told you,
Maybelle needs a website.


954
00:45:39.375 --> 00:45:41.420
I guess.

955
00:45:41.594 --> 00:45:44.293
You're right. You're right.

956
00:45:44.467 --> 00:45:45.816
Finally.

957
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:48.732
For marketing.
I am not selling online.


958
00:45:48.906 --> 00:45:52.344
So, how does this whole
website thing work anyway?


959
00:45:52.518 --> 00:45:54.216
No idea.

960
00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:57.175
It's entrepreneurial rule #7,
consult the expert.


961
00:45:58.568 --> 00:46:00.396
- Mo, over here.
- Mo: Hey.


962
00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:01.614
Hey.

963
00:46:01.789 --> 00:46:03.573
Skye wants a website.

964
00:46:03.747 --> 00:46:04.922
Oh, finally.

965
00:46:05.096 --> 00:46:06.881
You program, too?

966
00:46:07.055 --> 00:46:08.447
Yeah. Most cars have computers,

967
00:46:08.621 --> 00:46:10.101
not carburetors
these days, you know?


968
00:46:10.275 --> 00:46:13.191
And does Angel know
about this super power?


969
00:46:13.365 --> 00:46:14.584
It's something you
two can talk about


970
00:46:14.758 --> 00:46:16.586
the next time you
see each other.


971
00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:18.936
Nothing wrong with singing
your own praises a little.


972
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:22.374
That is entrepreneurial rule #4,
sing your own praises.


973
00:46:22.548 --> 00:46:24.420
No. I will take
dating advice from Skye,


974
00:46:24.594 --> 00:46:25.856
but not from you, dear brother.

975
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:27.336
Hey! Why not?

976
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:28.859
Because Skye actually
has a boyfriend.


977
00:46:29.033 --> 00:46:29.860
Jason: Oh, right.

978
00:46:30.034 --> 00:46:31.427
We're on a break.

979
00:46:31.601 --> 00:46:33.429
And you have a string
of relationships


980
00:46:33.603 --> 00:46:35.823
you always give up on before
they ever really get started,


981
00:46:35.997 --> 00:46:37.694
kind of like your businesses.

982
00:46:37.868 --> 00:46:39.783
I did not give up
on my businesses.


983
00:46:39.957 --> 00:46:42.264
I sold them,
and all for a profit, too.


984
00:46:42.438 --> 00:46:44.527
If they were successful,
why did you sell?


985
00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:46.050
Because that's what I do.

986
00:46:46.224 --> 00:46:47.922
I bring a product to the market,

987
00:46:48.096 --> 00:46:49.793
I create a consumer base,

988
00:46:49.967 --> 00:46:52.100
and then it's time to move on,
find a new challenge.


989
00:46:52.274 --> 00:46:53.797
The same way he is with women.

990
00:46:53.971 --> 00:46:56.626
And render.

991
00:46:58.019 --> 00:46:59.455
Not half bad.

992
00:46:59.629 --> 00:47:02.458
Still needs
a bit of work, but...


993
00:47:07.115 --> 00:47:09.030
- Wow.
- Wow.


994
00:47:09.204 --> 00:47:11.249
Swim shorts
and a Hawaiian shirt?


995
00:47:11.423 --> 00:47:13.817
Yeah, it's a fashion statement.

996
00:47:13.991 --> 00:47:15.123
A statement that says, "Help!"

997
00:47:17.299 --> 00:47:18.822
Okay.

998
00:47:21.825 --> 00:47:23.348
Hey.

999
00:47:24.959 --> 00:47:26.743
Oh.

1000
00:47:28.266 --> 00:47:32.270
You know, I think I know a way
to get us some more followers.

Skye! Is that you?

1066
00:50:54.472 --> 00:50:58.172
Amanda?! Hi!
It's so good to see you!


1067
00:50:58.346 --> 00:51:01.000
What-- what are you doing here?

1068
00:51:01.175 --> 00:51:04.003
It's a long story, but...

1069
00:51:04.178 --> 00:51:06.789
I have a really amazing chance
at getting a capsule collection


1070
00:51:06.963 --> 00:51:08.921
in at Forman's Department Store.

1071
00:51:09.096 --> 00:51:10.532
I just have to show
them that there's a market


1072
00:51:10.706 --> 00:51:12.882
for my Maybelle line
by doing $10,000 in sales


1073
00:51:13.056 --> 00:51:14.362
and getting 10,000
ShareZees followers.


1074
00:51:14.536 --> 00:51:16.190
So, you're selling

1075
00:51:16.364 --> 00:51:20.542
your beautiful samples
out of a food truck?


1076
00:51:20.716 --> 00:51:23.719
It's a mobile boutique.

1077
00:51:23.893 --> 00:51:25.373
And I love getting to meet

1078
00:51:25.547 --> 00:51:27.462
the people who are
wearing my clothes.


1079
00:51:27.636 --> 00:51:29.681
Do you remember my
pattern sizing program?


1080
00:51:29.855 --> 00:51:31.596
Okay, so my partner Jason,

1081
00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:34.338
he combined it with
a 3D modelling app,


1082
00:51:34.512 --> 00:51:35.861
so now, people can order clothes

1083
00:51:36.035 --> 00:51:39.169
that actually
fit them perfectly.


1084
00:51:39.343 --> 00:51:40.562
You're still making
clothes yourself?


1085
00:51:40.736 --> 00:51:42.868
Just... Just for now.

1086
00:51:43.042 --> 00:51:46.829
Gabriella was wrong to
fire you just for speaking up,


1087
00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:48.874
but she was right
about one thing,


1088
00:51:49.048 --> 00:51:51.616
there's only one way
to make it in fashion.


1089
00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:54.663
Glamour, and scale,
and exclusivity,


1090
00:51:54.837 --> 00:51:58.449
and this,
this isn't any of that.


1091
00:51:58.623 --> 00:52:00.799
I'm so sorry.

1092
00:52:05.978 --> 00:52:07.589
Foot traffic is tapering off.

1093
00:52:07.763 --> 00:52:09.895
Think it's about
time we pack it in?


1094
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:12.724
I guess, yeah.

1095
00:52:12.898 --> 00:52:16.554
I was thinking about
your shopping avatar.


1096
00:52:16.728 --> 00:52:18.513
I think it needs a name,

1097
00:52:18.687 --> 00:52:21.255
something jaunty and fun
that you can't forget,


1098
00:52:21.429 --> 00:52:25.084
like, uh, "My Shopping Buddy"
or "MeMyMo".


1099
00:52:25.259 --> 00:52:27.391
Uh, I talked to a patent lawyer.

1100
00:52:27.565 --> 00:52:29.480
She thinks we can get a patent,

1101
00:52:29.654 --> 00:52:31.395
license your product
to retailers.


1102
00:52:31.569 --> 00:52:32.875
We could change the industry.

1103
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:34.398
What?

1104
00:52:34.572 --> 00:52:36.531
You don't think
I can pull this off.


1105
00:52:36.705 --> 00:52:38.924
Are you kidding? We're breaking
our own sales records every day.


1106
00:52:39.098 --> 00:52:42.798
Then, why are you talking
about patents and licensing,


1107
00:52:42.972 --> 00:52:45.453
instead of getting
Maybelle into Forman's?


1108
00:52:45.627 --> 00:52:47.063
Well, because I--

1109
00:52:47.237 --> 00:52:48.978
no, you're right.
That was a stupid thought.


1110
00:52:50.458 --> 00:52:52.373
No, it wasn't.

1111
00:52:52.547 --> 00:52:54.157
No matter how
good our sales are,


1112
00:52:54.331 --> 00:52:55.854
I still don't
have enough followers


1113
00:52:56.028 --> 00:52:58.161
and I'm running out of time.

1114
00:52:58.335 --> 00:53:00.772
Would it be so bad if
Maybelle on Wheels went on?


1115
00:53:00.946 --> 00:53:04.254
Maybelle on Wheels is great,
but at some point,


1116
00:53:04.428 --> 00:53:09.172
I'm going to run out of samples
and I can't create new designs


1117
00:53:09.346 --> 00:53:13.698
if I'm always working to
reproduce the ones I have.


1118
00:53:13.872 --> 00:53:17.354
My dream is to be a designer,
not a seamstress,


1119
00:53:17.528 --> 00:53:20.618
and for that to happen, I have
to get places like Forman's


1120
00:53:20.792 --> 00:53:22.490
to want to carry my line,

1121
00:53:22.664 --> 00:53:25.406
instead of me having to go to
every market and park


1122
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.538
to showcase it myself.

1123
00:53:27.712 --> 00:53:28.800
Dreams change.

1124
00:53:28.974 --> 00:53:30.933
You would say that.

1125
00:53:31.107 --> 00:53:32.456
You'll probably have moved on

1126
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:34.850
to some other business
by summer anyway.


1127
00:53:35.024 --> 00:53:36.330
Indoor avocado farming

1128
00:53:36.504 --> 00:53:39.855
or personal
cell phone satellites?


1129
00:53:41.509 --> 00:53:43.206
I don't know. Maybe.

1130
00:53:45.077 --> 00:53:47.166
Patrick: Am I interrupting?

1131
00:53:47.341 --> 00:53:48.907
- Skye: Patrick?
- Hey.


1132
00:53:49.081 --> 00:53:50.909
No, we're-- we're just
packing up for the day.


1133
00:53:51.083 --> 00:53:52.520
Good, good. I'm glad I could
catch you before you left.


1134
00:53:52.694 --> 00:53:54.478
- It was a good day?
- Skye: Very.


1135
00:53:54.652 --> 00:53:56.654
We're right on track to meeting
the sales goal we need.


1136
00:53:56.828 --> 00:53:58.134
Patrick: That's great.

1137
00:53:58.308 --> 00:53:59.701
Skye: But my
ShareZees followers--


1138
00:53:59.875 --> 00:54:01.224
Got a big boost
from the dancing video.


1139
00:54:01.398 --> 00:54:02.312
We can do another
one on the weekend


1140
00:54:02.486 --> 00:54:03.705
if we get some new models.

1141
00:54:03.879 --> 00:54:06.185
Actually, I've got this.

1142
00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.926
You gotta come meet her.

1143
00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:09.145
Skye: Her?

1144
00:54:09.319 --> 00:54:11.190
Mary B.

1145
00:54:11.365 --> 00:54:12.844
There's an opportunity to work
with her and you're gonna get


1146
00:54:13.018 --> 00:54:14.629
all the ShareZees
followers you could ever need.


1147
00:54:14.803 --> 00:54:16.413
You're serious?

1148
00:54:16.587 --> 00:54:17.806
Had to pull a few strings,
call in a few favors,


1149
00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:21.679
but it's guaranteed to work.

1150
00:54:23.202 --> 00:54:24.769
Do you mind--

1151
00:54:24.943 --> 00:54:26.597
You should go.
Entrepreneurial rule #7, right?


1152
00:54:26.771 --> 00:54:28.860
"Consult the expert?"

1153
00:54:29.818 --> 00:54:31.254
Let's go, then.

1154
00:54:33.517 --> 00:54:35.389
Patrick: I'm really excited
about this opportunity.


1155
00:54:35.563 --> 00:54:37.565

her red carpet gown


1166
00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:09.640
at the ISM Fashion Awards
next week.


1167
00:55:09.814 --> 00:55:11.425
But...

1168
00:55:11.599 --> 00:55:14.428
But I haven't designed
a red carpet gown since...


1169
00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.388
...ever,
much less actually made one.


1170
00:55:18.562 --> 00:55:20.216
Why not?

1171
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:22.610
Because I design clothes
that people actually live in.


1172
00:55:22.784 --> 00:55:24.220
Red carpet gowns,
they're beautiful,


1173
00:55:24.394 --> 00:55:27.049
but they're not very me.

Well, just, you know,
make this one you,

but make it Mary B as well.

1176
00:55:30.748 --> 00:55:32.750
I mean, everything she wears
gets photographed to death


1177
00:55:32.924 --> 00:55:34.012
and posted everywhere.

Mary B, I'm Patrick Scott.
This is Skye Gozen.

She's gonna be your designer

So good to meet you. Mm.

1186
00:55:54.511 --> 00:55:57.166
I have been really
enjoying your feed.


1187
00:55:57.340 --> 00:55:58.515
Feed?

1188
00:55:58.689 --> 00:56:00.648
- ShareZees feed.
- Oh.


1189
00:56:02.258 --> 00:56:04.739
You have so many
cute, cute clothes,


1190
00:56:04.913 --> 00:56:07.132
and I would like
something just like that.


1191
00:56:07.306 --> 00:56:08.873
Thank you. I can show you--

1192
00:56:09.047 --> 00:56:12.790
Only red carpet.
You can do red carpet, right?


1193
00:56:12.964 --> 00:56:16.228
I, um... Yes. yes.

1194
00:56:16.403 --> 00:56:19.014
You know what? 
Go over there.

1195
00:56:20.319 --> 00:56:21.669
Wonderful.

1196
00:56:23.018 --> 00:56:25.237
I'll leave you to it.

1197
00:56:25.412 --> 00:56:26.848
Oh, you're not
going to be staying?


1198
00:56:27.022 --> 00:56:28.676
Oh, no, no. You just
send everything to Harry.


1199
00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:30.286
Harry knows what I like.

1200
00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:32.201
Stunning.

1201
00:56:32.375 --> 00:56:33.420
I know. Bye.

1202
00:56:33.594 --> 00:56:35.552
Bye.

1203
00:56:35.726 --> 00:56:38.163
- She's the best.
- Absolutely.


1204
00:56:40.427 --> 00:56:44.866
So, I'm thinking a classic
Grecian style dress.


1205
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:48.391
Simple, clean lines,
beautiful draping


1206
00:56:48.565 --> 00:56:50.524
and maybe a little
detail right here.


1207
00:56:50.698 --> 00:56:52.351
- I like it.
- You do?


1208
00:56:52.526 --> 00:56:54.092
Yeah, it's great.

1209
00:56:54.266 --> 00:56:56.051
Wow. I thought this was
gonna be a lot harder.


1210
00:56:56.225 --> 00:56:57.531
But with some volume.

1211
00:56:57.705 --> 00:56:59.010
Volu-- volume?

1212
00:56:59.184 --> 00:57:01.491
On a Grecian style dress?

1213
00:57:01.665 --> 00:57:03.972
Oh, definitely volume.

1214
00:57:05.147 --> 00:57:07.018
- Uh...
- Mm-hmm. Great.


1215
00:57:07.192 --> 00:57:08.455
Okay.

1216
00:57:08.629 --> 00:57:09.934
- Great. Just keep going.
- Okay.


1217
00:57:10.108 --> 00:57:11.545
Keep going,
keep going, keep going.


1218
00:57:11.719 --> 00:57:13.198
Perfect.

1219
00:57:13.372 --> 00:57:14.417
Oh...

1220
00:57:14.591 --> 00:57:15.766
high necklines are trending,

1221
00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:17.159
so let's go with that.

1222
00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:19.204
Are you sure?

1223
00:57:19.378 --> 00:57:20.902
You don't really see many red
carpet gowns with high necks.


1224
00:57:21.076 --> 00:57:22.817
Yeah, Mary B isn't
afraid to be innovative.


1225
00:57:22.991 --> 00:57:25.254
Is she afraid of melting?

1226
00:57:26.516 --> 00:57:28.387
It's already gonna
be really hot that night.


1227
00:57:28.562 --> 00:57:30.477
With the bulk of the dress and
the high neck, she just might--


1228
00:57:30.651 --> 00:57:31.913
You know, she never
really cares about that,


1229
00:57:32.087 --> 00:57:33.523
so long as she looks good.

1230
00:57:33.697 --> 00:57:34.872
But you know what?
I actually have a call


1231
00:57:35.046 --> 00:57:36.526
that I have to jump on.

1232
00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:38.485
Is this enough for you
to get started with?


1233
00:57:38.659 --> 00:57:40.269
Uh, I guess.

1234
00:57:42.663 --> 00:57:44.621
I like my clothes to be joyful.

1235
00:57:44.795 --> 00:57:49.017
I like to use bright blues
and pinks and yellows and--

Yeah,
that's great, that's great.


1237
00:57:51.585 --> 00:57:54.457
Oh, but make this gown
in grey, slate grey.


1238
00:57:54.631 --> 00:57:56.894
It's very on trend.

1239
00:57:57.068 --> 00:57:59.506
And add a veil,

1240
00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.290
like a thick one.

1241

1272
01:00:43.278 --> 01:00:45.715
But it's ugly.

1273
01:00:45.889 --> 01:00:47.761
You know, if you knew
anything about fashion,


1274
01:00:47.935 --> 01:00:49.850
I'd be really hurt by that.

1275
01:00:50.024 --> 01:00:51.068
It's not even you.

1276
01:00:51.242 --> 01:00:52.374
Well, you've just never seen me

1277
01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:54.463
do a red carpet gown before.

1278
01:00:54.637 --> 01:00:56.987
I've seen you do every
other kind of look.


1279
01:00:57.161 --> 01:00:58.946
I might not know fashion,
but I would know


1280
01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.296
one of your pieces
anywhere and this is


1281
01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:04.168
not you, except for
that pretty little bit.


1282
01:01:08.129 --> 01:01:10.522
Well, the client is
allowed some say.


1283
01:01:10.697 --> 01:01:12.481
All of the say, I'd say.

1284
01:01:12.655 --> 01:01:15.527
I thought you didn't want to
do things like this anymore,


1285
01:01:15.702 --> 01:01:19.227
design what other people want,
instead of what's true to you.


1286
01:01:19.401 --> 01:01:22.230
What's true to me is
getting my line into Forman's


1287
01:01:22.404 --> 01:01:25.494
and reaching a thousand
new clients every day.


1288
01:01:25.668 --> 01:01:27.148
I mean,
it's not the end of the world


1289
01:01:27.322 --> 01:01:29.454
if I have to compromise
over a little dress.


1290
01:01:29.628 --> 01:01:31.282
Little?

1291
01:01:31.456 --> 01:01:32.936
There is absolutely nothing
little about this dress.


1292
01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:34.459
This discussion is over.

1293
01:01:34.633 --> 01:01:36.157
Let's just get
to the truck and go.


1294
01:01:36.331 --> 01:01:37.724
Let's just be a team
with us in the truck.


1295
01:01:37.898 --> 01:01:39.203
We'll get you all
the followers you need.


1296
01:01:39.377 --> 01:01:40.770
Nope, we can't.

1297
01:01:40.944 --> 01:01:42.511
Mary B wants
to see what I have so far.


1298
01:01:42.685 --> 01:01:43.860
Let's go, then.

1299
01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.514
Oh, no. You're not coming.

1300
01:01:45.688 --> 01:01:47.690
Are you gonna take
this thing on the subway?


1301
01:01:47.864 --> 01:01:49.126
This plenty of room
for this in the truck.


1302
01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:51.563
Ah.
And you're gonna drive.


1303
01:01:52.826 --> 01:01:54.610
Fine. You get the train.

1304
01:01:56.307 --> 01:01:57.613
It has a train?

1305
01:01:57.787 --> 01:01:59.397
Oh, I can't wear this.

1306
01:01:59.571 --> 01:02:00.964
I've got to change. Here.

1307
01:02:01.138 --> 01:02:03.271
I'll meet you down there.

1308
01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.017
Is Mary B
going to be here soon?


1309
01:02:10.191 --> 01:02:12.410
I'd love to hear
what she thinks.


1310
01:02:12.584 --> 01:02:15.674
Mary B had to fly out
to London last night.


1311
01:02:15.849 --> 01:02:17.067
But how are we--

1312
01:02:17.241 --> 01:02:19.287
Oh, we think alike
on everything.


1313
01:02:19.461 --> 01:02:21.028
Hmm. Looks good on still,

1314
01:02:21.202 --> 01:02:24.205
but I just don't
know about video.


1315
01:02:24.379 --> 01:02:27.686
It needs to have movement.
Does this move?


1316
01:02:27.861 --> 01:02:29.297
It's a boulder.

1317
01:02:30.515 --> 01:02:32.039
No, I need to see it walk.

1318
01:02:32.213 --> 01:02:33.867
We're gonna need
somebody to model it.


1319
01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:35.869
Yeah.

1320
01:02:37.522 --> 01:02:39.481
Oh, no.

1321
01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:43.137
Hope you had a good breakfast.
That thing weighs a ton.


1322
01:02:57.238 --> 01:02:59.240
Oh.

1323
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:03.287
I just came by
to see how you're doing.


1324
01:03:05.463 --> 01:03:07.117
Harry: Okay, just walk
over to that corner of the room.


1325
01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:09.903
Okay.

1326
01:03:10.077 --> 01:03:12.383
Harry: Mm-hmm.

1327
01:03:12.557 --> 01:03:13.907
Oh...

1328
01:03:14.081 --> 01:03:15.343
I'm good.

1329
01:03:15.517 --> 01:03:16.823
Okay, now,
give us a little spin.


1330
01:03:19.564 --> 01:03:21.262
No, it definitely
needs more movement.


1331
01:03:21.436 --> 01:03:23.351
Well, maybe if I
took out some of the volume in--


1332
01:03:23.525 --> 01:03:25.309
No! No. Volume is good.

1333
01:03:25.483 --> 01:03:27.442
Volume is in.

1334
01:03:27.616 --> 01:03:29.096
But we need movement.

1335
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:31.620
Let me just check
what the trends are saying.


1336
01:03:35.537 --> 01:03:39.410
Can you give me
a hand here? Please?


1337
01:03:39.584 --> 01:03:42.631
Of course,
Princess Thunder Cloud.


1338
01:03:47.679 --> 01:03:49.072
Thanks.

1339
01:03:49.246 --> 01:03:50.073
Streamers!

1340
01:03:50.247 --> 01:03:51.770
What?

1341
01:03:51.945 --> 01:03:54.208
Yes, streamers.
Streamers pouring from the back,


1342
01:03:54.382 --> 01:03:56.123
the sides, and the sleeves.

1343
01:03:56.297 --> 01:03:58.299
But there aren't any sleeves.

1344
01:03:58.473 --> 01:03:59.866
There will be. 
Yeah, in fact,

1345
01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:02.042
let's move all the
volume up from the skirt


1346
01:04:02.216 --> 01:04:03.565
and into the sleeves.

1347
01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:04.609
But I stayed up
all night working on


1348
01:04:04.783 --> 01:04:05.741
the volume in this skirt.

1349
01:04:05.915 --> 01:04:07.830
Okay. Is that a problem?

1350
01:04:08.004 --> 01:04:09.876
Well, it's...

1351
01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:11.312
Oh, you know what?

1352
01:04:11.486 --> 01:04:13.880
Actually, I have to take this.

1353
01:04:14.054 --> 01:04:16.883
Seems like it's going
pretty great, huh?


1354
01:04:17.057 --> 01:04:18.754
I don't think this is
working out, Patrick.


1355
01:04:18.928 --> 01:04:21.713
Harry keeps changing
the design every three hours,


1356
01:04:21.888 --> 01:04:23.324
and I stayed up all night,
working on this skirt,


1357
01:04:23.498 --> 01:04:25.326
and I couldn't get out
with the truck.


1358
01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.154
Maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.


1359
01:04:27.328 --> 01:04:29.634
Are you kidding me?

1360
01:04:29.808 --> 01:04:31.158
Have you seen how many
followers you have?


1361
01:04:31.332 --> 01:04:32.376
The event isn't until next week.

1362
01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:34.204
Harry's posting everything.

1363
01:04:34.378 --> 01:04:36.815
He takes your sketches,
work in progress pictures,


1364
01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:38.556
and he tags you.
You have over 5000 followers.


1365
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:39.644
Look.

1366
01:04:39.818 --> 01:04:41.211
- What?
- Yeah.


1367
01:04:41.385 --> 01:04:43.692
That's amazing.

1368
01:04:43.866 --> 01:04:46.260
Here, I'll show you
how you're trending.


1369
01:04:46.434 --> 01:04:48.131
It's working, Jason.

1370
01:04:48.305 --> 01:04:50.612
That's great.

1371
01:04:53.354 --> 01:04:55.443
Let's get this grey giant

1372
01:04:55.617 --> 01:04:57.227
back to your place
for round two, then.


1373
01:04:57.401 --> 01:05:00.230
Well, actually,
I think it'd be okay with Harry


1374
01:05:00.404 --> 01:05:01.971
if she worked on it here.

1375
01:05:02.145 --> 01:05:03.799
And that way, you don't
have to keep coming over.


1376
01:05:03.973 --> 01:05:06.367
That's a good idea. I can get
started on it right away.


1377
01:05:06.541 --> 01:05:08.369
There's lots to do.

1378
01:05:08.543 --> 01:05:11.372
Oh. Sure. Right, then.

1379
01:05:11.546 --> 01:05:14.375
Uh, I'll leave you to it.

1380
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:23.514
Patrick: So, what changes
do you have planned?


1381
01:05:27.344 --> 01:05:37.344
♪

1382
01:05:42.751 --> 01:05:45.536
Mo: What are you looking at
with so much enthusiasm?


1383
01:05:47.234 --> 01:05:49.540
New start up ideas.

1384
01:05:49.714 --> 01:05:51.586
"Pharmaceutical resales."

1385
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.676
"Headhunting apps
for security firms."


1386
01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.722
Ooh, "corporate
wellness services."


1387
01:05:57.896 --> 01:06:00.595
Wow. See you can
barely contain yourself.


1388
01:06:03.337 --> 01:06:05.121
What about Maybelle on Wheels?

1389
01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:07.036
Skye's about to nail
her department store deal,


1390
01:06:07.210 --> 01:06:09.865
then she won't need
Maybelle on Wheels anymore.


1391
01:06:10.039 --> 01:06:12.781
Huh, there's a first,
business and a woman leaving you


1392
01:06:12.955 --> 01:06:14.304
before you can
leave either of them.


1393
01:06:14.478 --> 01:06:16.741
Nobody is getting left.

1394
01:06:16.915 --> 01:06:19.179
This was the plan for
Maybelle on Wheels all along.


1395
01:06:19.353 --> 01:06:20.745
What about getting left by Skye?

1396
01:06:20.919 --> 01:06:25.707
She can't leave.
She was never with me.


1397
01:06:25.881 --> 01:06:28.797
Not like that.
She has a boyfriend, remember?


1398
01:06:28.971 --> 01:06:30.190
But I thought
they were on a break.


1399
01:06:30.364 --> 01:06:31.582
Are the sparks still flying?

1400
01:06:31.756 --> 01:06:34.281
Well, not flying,

1401
01:06:34.455 --> 01:06:37.240
but simmering for him.

1402
01:06:37.414 --> 01:06:38.850
But not for her?

1403
01:06:39.025 --> 01:06:40.548
I'm sure she never
turns to him and says,


1404
01:06:40.722 --> 01:06:43.333
"You know nothing
about fashion."


1405
01:06:45.422 --> 01:06:46.989
Speaking of simmering.

1406
01:06:47.163 --> 01:06:49.339
Ahh, no. I have an Easy-On
tool demo to get to.


1407
01:06:49.513 --> 01:06:50.862
How is your makeover going?

1408
01:06:51.037 --> 01:06:52.125
When are you gonna
get up the courage


1409
01:06:52.299 --> 01:06:53.648
to go ask Angel on a date?

1410
01:06:53.822 --> 01:06:55.998
Probably never?

1411
01:06:56.172 --> 01:06:58.044
Besides,
Angel's brother Hector told me


1412
01:06:58.218 --> 01:07:00.350
that Angel has to go to
El Salvador for a month


1413
01:07:00.524 --> 01:07:02.309
to visit family,
so there's no point.


1414
01:07:02.483 --> 01:07:03.658
Well, when's he leave?

1415
01:07:03.832 --> 01:07:04.746
Next week.

1416
01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:05.964
That's plenty of time.

1417
01:07:06.139 --> 01:07:08.097
Bye.

1418
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:18.455
Everything okay?

1419
01:07:18.629 --> 01:07:20.196
- Skye...
- I wanted to bring these by


1420
01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.677
for Mo, but I tried to
stop her on her way out


1421
01:07:22.851 --> 01:07:25.462
and she muttered something
about tools and kept going.


1422
01:07:25.636 --> 01:07:27.073
She's got a meeting
with an Easy-On rep.


1423
01:07:27.247 --> 01:07:30.293
Well, do you have a second?

1424
01:07:30.467 --> 01:07:31.903
I'm desperate for some ice cream

1425
01:07:32.078 --> 01:07:35.168
and I really hate
getting chip-faced alone.


1426
01:07:35.342 --> 01:07:37.431
- I could eat.
- Hmm.


1427
01:07:40.173 --> 01:07:41.826
When Mo was leaving,

1428
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.395
you said that she
still had plenty of time.


1429
01:07:45.569 --> 01:07:47.005
Time for what?

1430
01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:49.182
To ask Angel for a date.

1431
01:07:49.356 --> 01:07:51.271
She's got one week left.

1432
01:07:51.445 --> 01:07:53.055
What happens after a week?

1433
01:07:53.229 --> 01:07:55.188
Trip back to El Salvador
to see his family, I think.


1434
01:07:55.362 --> 01:07:57.015
Oh.

1435
01:07:57.190 --> 01:08:00.410
I don't know if your
makeover sessions are working.


1436
01:08:00.584 --> 01:08:02.804
Hey, they're working a little.

1437
01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:04.501
Then, why doesn't
she have the confidence


1438
01:08:04.675 --> 01:08:07.156
to ask for a date already?

1439
01:08:07.330 --> 01:08:12.248
Well, confidence isn't
like a set of rules you learn.


1440
01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:15.599
It's a state of mind.

1441
01:08:15.773 --> 01:08:19.560
It's about accepting
yourself without judgement.


1442
01:08:19.734 --> 01:08:23.477
Right. Well...

1443
01:08:25.609 --> 01:08:27.045
That's not happening.

1444
01:08:27.220 --> 01:08:29.961
Mo's so focused on
what she doesn't have


1445
01:08:30.136 --> 01:08:32.660
that she can't
see what she does.


1446
01:08:32.834 --> 01:08:34.618
I'm gonna think on
how to help her with that.


1447
01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:41.059
Last I checked,
you were still trending.


1448
01:08:41.234 --> 01:08:42.496
Congratulations.

1449
01:08:42.670 --> 01:08:44.367
You don't mean that.

1450
01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:46.021
Yeah, I do.

1451
01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.938
I shouldn't have said
those things about your work.


1452
01:08:50.112 --> 01:08:53.768
I'm sorry.
I may not know fashion,


1453
01:08:53.942 --> 01:08:56.988
but I'm smart enough to
know you're really special.


1454
01:08:58.773 --> 01:09:02.516
Thank you for saying that

1455
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:05.214
and for apologizing.

1456
01:09:05.388 --> 01:09:08.435
I know I said you know
nothing about fashion,


1457
01:09:08.609 --> 01:09:10.088
which was true.

1458
01:09:10.263 --> 01:09:12.743
"Was" true.

1459
01:09:12.917 --> 01:09:14.919
But you've been really
open to learning and adapting.


1460
01:09:15.093 --> 01:09:16.791
Not that many
people can do that.


1461
01:09:18.227 --> 01:09:20.751
I think you're
pretty special, too.


1462
01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:23.145
You're ice cream's melting.

1463
01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:24.451
So is yours.

1464
01:09:24.625 --> 01:09:26.061
Oh.

1465
01:09:27.367 --> 01:09:29.151
Here, hold this.

1466
01:09:29.325 --> 01:09:31.719
I think I know what Mo needs.

1467
01:09:34.330 --> 01:09:35.810
Turn around.

1468
01:09:49.171 --> 01:09:50.825
There.

1469
01:09:55.569 --> 01:09:58.006
Can you make sure to
put this in the jacket pocket?


1470
01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.273
Okay.

1471
01:10:10.323 --> 01:10:20.323
♪

1472
01:10:28.689 --> 01:10:30.212
Okay.

1473
01:10:32.258 --> 01:10:35.739
We're gonna ask
Angel out on that date.


1474
01:10:35.913 --> 01:10:37.785
You got this.

1475
01:10:37.959 --> 01:10:39.134
Ugh!

1476
01:10:39.308 --> 01:10:43.399
Who am I kidding?

1477
01:10:51.712 --> 01:10:53.148
Skye:
"You are amazing.


1478
01:10:53.322 --> 01:10:56.717
"You are beautiful.
You are enough."


1479
01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.560
What is that?

1480
01:11:13.734 --> 01:11:15.213
Mo: I knew I shouldn't
have done this.


1481
01:11:15.388 --> 01:11:16.693
Stay here.

1482
01:11:16.867 --> 01:11:17.999
Mo:
Please come back another time!


1483
01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:19.653
- Hey, Mo?
- We're closed.


1484
01:11:19.827 --> 01:11:20.784
- Mo, it's me.
- Jason, please just go away.


1485
01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:22.264
Harry Skye.

1486
01:11:22.438 --> 01:11:24.527
Skye:
Harry, I finished the gown.


1487
01:11:24.701 --> 01:11:26.007
Harry:
Oh, that's great.


1488
01:11:26.181 --> 01:11:27.574
There have been
some more changes.


1489
01:11:27.748 --> 01:11:29.097
You are going to love it.

1490
01:11:29.271 --> 01:11:32.056
But the ISM Awards
are tomorrow night.


1491
01:11:32.230 --> 01:11:33.754
Harry: ...pants!

1492
01:11:33.928 --> 01:11:35.495
Harry?

1493
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:37.061
Harry, my phone's about to die.
What changes?


1494
01:11:37.235 --> 01:11:38.759
We're going with pants.

1495
01:11:38.933 --> 01:11:40.761
Mo: Why couldn't I have
just followed my gut?


1496
01:11:42.806 --> 01:11:45.243
No!

1497
01:11:47.028 --> 01:11:49.335
What? What is this?

1498
01:11:49.509 --> 01:11:50.336
Mo asked Angel for a date.

1499
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:51.554
And?

1500
01:11:51.728 --> 01:11:52.903
Does it sound like he said yes?

1501
01:11:53.077 --> 01:11:57.125
Oh, Mo.
I should go talk to her.


1502
01:11:57.299 --> 01:11:58.605
No. You had your chance
to talk to her before


1503
01:11:58.779 --> 01:11:59.823
and you cancelled
to work on that--


1504
01:11:59.997 --> 01:12:01.085
that dust bunny of a dress.

1505
01:12:01.259 --> 01:12:02.522
Why'd you even bother to start

1506
01:12:02.696 --> 01:12:04.175
if you were never
planning to stay?


1507
01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:06.003
You're not mad about
Mo getting turned down.


1508
01:12:06.177 --> 01:12:07.570
No, I am.

1509
01:12:07.744 --> 01:12:09.180
No, you're mad
because you think that,


1510
01:12:09.355 --> 01:12:10.747
for the first time,
something or someone


1511
01:12:10.921 --> 01:12:12.401
might walk away from you
before you have a chance


1512
01:12:12.575 --> 01:12:13.794
to walk away from them,

1513
01:12:13.968 --> 01:12:15.752
like every woman
you've ever dated,


1514
01:12:15.926 --> 01:12:17.624
every business
you've ever started.


1515
01:12:17.798 --> 01:12:19.800
I sold out of my businesses.

1516
01:12:19.974 --> 01:12:22.803
I didn't sell
myself out like you're doing.


1517
01:12:22.977 --> 01:12:24.848
What are you even talking about?

1518
01:12:25.022 --> 01:12:26.459
I've seen literally hundreds,
if not thousands


1519
01:12:26.633 --> 01:12:28.112
of your designs.

1520
01:12:28.286 --> 01:12:30.245
I've seen you use every
color known to man


1521
01:12:30.419 --> 01:12:33.901
and a few I'm pretty
sure only cats can see.


1522
01:12:34.075 --> 01:12:35.816
None of your designs,
none of 'em,


1523
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:37.905
have ever been grey,

1524
01:12:38.079 --> 01:12:39.863
and you're changing
the design every ten minutes.


1525
01:12:40.037 --> 01:12:42.388
Designs get
revised all the time.


1526
01:12:42.562 --> 01:12:44.346
Sure, because you
get a better idea


1527
01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.956
or something isn't working,

1528
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:47.567
not because you're
chasing some silly trend,


1529
01:12:47.741 --> 01:12:49.220
trying to please a client
you've barely met.


1530
01:12:49.395 --> 01:12:52.485
I'm doing what I have
to do to get my dream!


1531
01:12:52.659 --> 01:12:54.356
Is that really
the most important thing?


1532
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:56.619
Yes!

1533
01:12:56.793 --> 01:12:58.926
Why do you think
I'm doing all of this?


1534
01:13:00.493 --> 01:13:02.582
Well, you better go do it, then,

1535
01:13:02.756 --> 01:13:04.148
but you're on your own.

1536
01:13:05.019 --> 01:13:06.412
Do you really mean that?

1537
01:13:07.587 --> 01:13:09.502
Yeah, I do.

1538
01:13:09.676 --> 01:13:11.242
Fine, then.

1540

You still can't drive stick!

1541
01:13:22.863 --> 01:13:24.038
Sorry.

1542
01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.526
Jason.

1543
01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:35.179
Ugh!

1544
01:13:35.353 --> 01:13:36.659
You can do this.

1545
01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:38.182
You're just
psyching yourself out.


1546

Don't let the truck
intimidate you.


1547
01:13:41.055 --> 01:13:43.927
Okay. Foot on the brake.

1548
01:13:44.101 --> 01:13:46.974
Push in the clutch.

1549

Put it in neutral.

1550
01:13:51.718 --> 01:13:54.242
Put it into first.

1551
01:13:55.591 --> 01:13:59.377
Let out the clutch slowly.

01:13:59.552 --> 01:14:02.076
Push on the gas.

Woo-hoo!

Woo-hoo-hoo!

Oh, there's an article
in The Times today


1560
01:14:46.207 --> 01:14:47.600
about the rising popularity
of rainbow trout

01:14:47.774 --> 01:14:49.340
in haute cuisine.

1562

What about Skye?

Don't tell me you're
leaving a business and a woman


1568
01:15:01.701 --> 01:15:04.486
at the same time.
That's too much, even for you.

She's over. They're over.
Skye and Maybelle on Wheels.

By tonight, she'll have
all the followers she needs


1571
01:15:11.493 --> 01:15:14.148
to seal the collection deal
and she won't need me anymore.


1572
01:15:14.322 --> 01:15:16.019
You asked her to leave,
didn't you?


1573
01:15:16.193 --> 01:15:19.501
Don't you defend her, too.
She let you down.

The missed appointments,

the way that Angel
turned you down.


1577

You can't blame Skye
for Angel turning me down.


1578
01:15:28.205 --> 01:15:30.468
But if she hadn't started,
you wouldn't have asked


1579
01:15:30.643 --> 01:15:32.514
and then you wouldn't
have got your heart broken.

I'm not heartbroken.
Okay, I might have overreacted

a tiny little bit there,
just towards the beginning.

turned down for date,

Besides, I'm glad I did it.

1585
01:15:47.398 --> 01:15:49.313
- Are you really?
- Yeah.


1586
01:15:49.487 --> 01:15:51.881
Now, I can stop bribing you
to get me pupusas all the time.


1587
01:15:55.363 --> 01:15:56.843
Well, I'm not gonna stand
around here and watch you


1588
01:15:57.017 --> 01:15:58.888
pack up and run away
from yet another business


1589
01:15:59.062 --> 01:16:00.890
- and another relationship.
- Hey!


1590
01:16:01.064 --> 01:16:01.935
No. Sorry. If you don't know
a good thing when you have it,


1591
01:16:02.109 --> 01:16:04.024
I can't help you.

1592
01:16:04.198 --> 01:16:05.982
Besides, I have a date.

1593
01:16:06.156 --> 01:16:07.201
I thought Angel said no.

1594
01:16:07.375 --> 01:16:09.638
Yeah, he did, he did, all right.

1595
01:16:09.812 --> 01:16:10.857
But Chris, however,

1596
01:16:11.031 --> 01:16:12.685
the Easy
-On Tool rep...

1597
01:16:15.035 --> 01:16:16.558
He did not.

1598
01:16:52.855 --> 01:16:54.509
Oh!

1599
01:16:56.424 --> 01:16:58.513
Hey.

1600
01:16:58.687 --> 01:17:00.341
Excuse me.

1601
01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:01.995
Excuse me, you don't know me,

1602
01:17:02.169 --> 01:17:03.518
but that dress that
you're wearing, I ac--


1603
01:17:03.692 --> 01:17:04.519
Amanda?

1604
01:17:04.693 --> 01:17:06.303
Skye, hi!

1605
01:17:06.477 --> 01:17:07.522
That's my dress!

1606
01:17:07.696 --> 01:17:08.871
Yeah.

1607
01:17:09.045 --> 01:17:10.786
I couldn't stop thinking about

1608
01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.875
your mobile boutique idea
and went back for another look.


1609
01:17:13.049 --> 01:17:15.965
You were off somewhere,
but your partner


1610
01:17:16.139 --> 01:17:18.576
insisted I try it on and...

1611
01:17:20.230 --> 01:17:23.103
Now, it's my favorite
thing in my closet.


1612
01:17:23.277 --> 01:17:24.670
He really has
an eye for fashion.


1613
01:17:24.844 --> 01:17:27.585
Yeah, he really does now.

1614
01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:30.545
It looks so beautiful on you.

1615
01:17:31.851 --> 01:17:33.287
I'd love to grab a coffee

1616
01:17:33.461 --> 01:17:35.506
and hear all about
your mobile boutique.


1617
01:17:35.681 --> 01:17:38.248
I... I think I was
too quick to judge before.


1618
01:17:38.422 --> 01:17:40.773
I have a meeting
to get to right now,


1619
01:17:40.947 --> 01:17:42.557
but I'd love that, too.

1620
01:17:42.731 --> 01:17:43.993
Soon, okay?

1621
01:17:44.167 --> 01:17:45.821
That would be great.

1622
01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:48.781
Great. Bye.

1623
01:17:55.918 --> 01:17:57.790
- Patrick...
- Patrick: Hey.


1624
01:17:57.964 --> 01:18:00.314
You didn't think I'd miss your
big moment of triumph, right?


1625
01:18:00.488 --> 01:18:01.750
Uh, Mary B's almost ready.

1626
01:18:01.924 --> 01:18:04.144
Okay.

1627
01:18:09.889 --> 01:18:12.500
Oh, this is gonna get
photographed to death.


1628
01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.815
Skye, thank you so much.

1629
01:18:22.989 --> 01:18:24.642
I cannot wait to tell everyone

1630
01:18:24.817 --> 01:18:28.429
that I am wearing
a Skye Gozen original.


1631
01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:30.518
And I don't know how you came
up with the idea of this dress


1632
01:18:30.692 --> 01:18:33.042
because I have
never even imagined


1633
01:18:33.216 --> 01:18:34.565
anything like this.

1634
01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:35.958
Oh, but I thought
that you were--


1635
01:18:36.132 --> 01:18:37.960
You know what?

1636
01:18:38.134 --> 01:18:42.269
I'm, uh, just gonna do a couple
more styling tweaks, okay?


1637
01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:49.058
I thought that the changes
Harry kept giving me


1638
01:18:49.232 --> 01:18:51.191
we're coming from Mary B.

1639
01:18:51.365 --> 01:18:52.714
I don't think she had any idea.

1640
01:18:52.888 --> 01:18:54.368
It doesn't matter
who's idea it was,


1641
01:18:54.542 --> 01:18:56.500
that dress is still yours.

1642
01:18:56.674 --> 01:18:58.067
No, it's not.

1643
01:18:58.241 --> 01:18:59.242
That dress is going to
make headlines,


1644
01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:01.027
Skye, along with your name.

1645
01:19:01.201 --> 01:19:03.377
Forman's is gonna beg you
to give them a collection


1646
01:19:03.551 --> 01:19:06.684
and they're gonna promote me
for discovering you.


1647
01:19:06.859 --> 01:19:09.383
I told you,
we make the perfect couple.


1648
01:19:09.557 --> 01:19:14.127
This is too good not
to start photographing.


1649
01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:37.063
Skye: "You are amazing.
You are beautiful.


1650
01:19:37.237 --> 01:19:39.587
"You are enough."

1651
01:19:39.761 --> 01:19:43.547
Patrick:
Time to post and tag Skye.


1652
01:19:45.854 --> 01:19:47.421
No.

1653
01:19:48.596 --> 01:19:50.772
Don't do that. Don't tag me

1654
01:19:50.946 --> 01:19:53.166
and don't tell anyone
that I designed this dress.


1655
01:19:53.340 --> 01:19:55.124
- It's not mine.
- Skye...


1656
01:19:55.298 --> 01:19:58.562
Patrick, I can't take credit for
something that is not my design,


1657
01:19:58.736 --> 01:20:02.740
not even for my collection,
not even for you.


1658
01:20:05.918 --> 01:20:07.223
You should probably get going.

1659
01:20:07.397 --> 01:20:09.573
You don't want to
miss the red carpet.


1660
01:20:11.967 --> 01:20:14.274
But wait,

1661
01:20:14.448 --> 01:20:15.928
who am I going to tell
everyone I'm wearing?


1662
01:20:16.102 --> 01:20:18.931
Maybe Harry can tell you.

1663
01:20:19.105 --> 01:20:20.236
Yeah.

1664
01:20:20.410 --> 01:20:24.588
Um... funny story, um...

1665
01:20:26.547 --> 01:20:29.593
I-- I can't believe
you just did that.


1666
01:20:29.767 --> 01:20:32.118
You really can't believe that
I wouldn't want to take credit


1667
01:20:32.292 --> 01:20:33.771
for a design that isn't mine?

1668
01:20:33.946 --> 01:20:35.948
No, not when it means
giving up on your dreams


1669
01:20:36.122 --> 01:20:38.037
of having your collection
in hundreds of stores,


1670
01:20:38.211 --> 01:20:40.822
or both of us getting exactly
the careers we've always wanted.


1671
01:20:40.996 --> 01:20:42.476
Both of us?

1672
01:20:44.652 --> 01:20:46.523
Patrick, was this
whole thing just about you


1673
01:20:46.697 --> 01:20:48.699
getting approval
from your bosses?


1674
01:20:48.874 --> 01:20:51.311
All I know is
we were taking a break


1675
01:20:51.485 --> 01:20:52.790
and then everything
seemed to change.


1676
01:20:52.965 --> 01:20:54.967
This is more than a break.
It's...


1677
01:20:56.359 --> 01:20:57.795
It's a break-up.

1678
01:20:57.970 --> 01:21:00.581
Are you serious?

1679
01:21:00.755 --> 01:21:02.496
Yeah, I am.

1680
01:21:03.801 --> 01:21:08.458
I need to be with someone
who wants me to be me.


1681
01:21:10.634 --> 01:21:14.551
Goodbye, Patrick. Good luck.

1682

What are you gonna
do now, Skye?

You know, there's really
only one thing I wanna do.

Yeah, we're going to
the airport.


1687

So, you've moved on
to a new business already.

Uh, yeah. Trout.

Do you need a ride?

Can the transmission take it?

This truck and I have
come to an understanding.

- I'm such an idiot.
- I don't know.

Trout's been getting
really popular lately.

Yeah, I've been pretty

01:22:55.652 --> 01:22:57.785
I didn't realize that
the dress I was making for


1700
01:22:57.959 --> 01:23:02.355
Mary B was actually
Harry's design and not my own.


1701
01:23:02.529 --> 01:23:04.009
In my defense, though,

1702
01:23:04.183 --> 01:23:06.098
he was really sneaky
about the whole thing.


1703
01:23:06.272 --> 01:23:07.316
So, what did you do?

1704
01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:09.579
I refused to take credit for it.

But without that dress--

No ShareZees followers,

1707
01:23:12.495 --> 01:23:15.020
which means no line at Froman's

as it turns out.

- It's okay.

We weren't the perfect couple
that he thought we were.


1712

I thought that having my clothes
in a big store like Froman's


1713
01:23:32.428 --> 01:23:36.476
was my dream, but it's not.

It was just the way to my dream.

This is my dream,
as it turns out.


1716
01:23:45.746 --> 01:23:48.314
To make beautiful clothes

1717
01:23:48.488 --> 01:23:52.144
and to help people find the ones
that are perfect for them.


1718
01:23:54.624 --> 01:23:57.062
And I couldn't have
done it without you,

not without your help
and your faith

and even your
entrepreneur rules.

01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:17.838
This is a great idea.
LA runs on wheels.


1741
01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:19.883
I can't believe
we're expanding already.


1742
01:25:20.057 --> 01:25:23.626
Jason: Six trucks was
all New York could handle.


1743
01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.629
Jason, you're not getting
bored yet, are you?


1744
01:25:26.803 --> 01:25:30.198
I mean, wishing you'd gotten
into fishing hatcheries


1745
01:25:30.372 --> 01:25:34.246
or solar panel futures
or anything like that?


1746
01:25:34.420 --> 01:25:35.812
Bored?

1747
01:25:37.771 --> 01:25:39.686
How could I ever
be bored with you?
