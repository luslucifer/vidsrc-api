00:00:35.673 --> 00:00:36.708
What?

2
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:39.276
♪ Today is your birthday ♪

3
00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.713
- ♪ It's my birthday too ♪
- It's not my birthday,


4
00:00:41.746 --> 00:00:43.547
you piece of shit.

5
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:45.215
Every day is your birthday,

6
00:00:45.248 --> 00:00:46.851
and today is the gift
of conversation.


7
00:00:46.884 --> 00:00:48.620
I don't want your conversation.

8
00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:51.856
Your voice is making me
wanna pour Drano down my ears.


9
00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:54.726
Aww, that's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me!


10
00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:57.260
I love you so much,
I'll take that to my...


11
00:01:12.577 --> 00:01:13.945
- Mm.
- Mm.


12
00:01:13.978 --> 00:01:14.946
Can I help you?

13
00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.279
I didn't mean
to blow you off last night,


14
00:01:16.313 --> 00:01:17.414
okay?

15
00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:18.482
Okay.

16
00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:19.316
Wait!

17
00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:20.785
I took two Nyquil
and passed out.


18
00:01:20.818 --> 00:01:23.588
I didn't wake up until
after midnight, I swear.


19
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:25.590
I put on normal clothes for you.

20
00:01:25.623 --> 00:01:26.891
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:26.924 --> 00:01:30.862
But I got you Pedialyte
and a burrito.


22
00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:32.630
I think it's cheese.

23
00:01:32.664 --> 00:01:34.599
I assumed you might need it
after the very aggressive


24
00:01:34.632 --> 00:01:36.834
and slurred hate message
you left me.


25
00:01:36.868 --> 00:01:40.370
- Don't make any jokes.
- Right. Sorry.


26
00:01:40.404 --> 00:01:42.272
Can I come in?

27
00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:43.875
Please?

28
00:01:43.908 --> 00:01:47.578
You're, uh, glowing today,
by the way.


29
00:01:47.612 --> 00:01:49.312
You are! You're...
you're beautiful,


30
00:01:49.346 --> 00:01:50.948
you're a queen,
I'm serious, please.


31
00:01:50.982 --> 00:01:52.449
If you do that again,

32
00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:54.952
you better ingest
every Nyquil pill you own.


33
00:01:54.986 --> 00:01:56.486
Done.

34
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.489
- I'm serious.
- I... fuckin' promise.


35
00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:00.892
Okay, then,
wipe that smile off your face!


36
00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:03.661
I'm... I'm trying, but it's...

37
00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:05.963
- I'm serious.
- Can I fuckin' enter, or...


38
00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.373
Uh-uh-uh!

39
00:02:16.406 --> 00:02:17.875
What?

40
00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.509
Burrito.

41
00:02:19.543 --> 00:02:20.678
Mm.

42
00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:27.350
Thank you.

43
00:02:29.721 --> 00:02:32.422
Uh! Scratch my back.

44
00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:36.526
All right.

45
00:02:40.363 --> 00:02:42.466
- Like this?
- Harder.


46
00:02:42.499 --> 00:02:44.468
Down.

47
00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:45.569
- Mm.
- Mm-hm.


48
00:02:45.603 --> 00:02:47.537
To the left a little.

49
00:02:47.572 --> 00:02:49.006
Yeah.

50
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.508
Do that one thing
that I like.


51
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:53.310
Mm-hm.

52
00:02:53.343 --> 00:02:54.879
- That's not what I like!
- This one thing.


53
00:02:54.912 --> 00:02:56.279
- No.
- I'm outta here.


54
00:02:56.313 --> 00:02:57.380
No!

55
00:02:57.414 --> 00:02:59.984
Nathan, stop.

56
00:03:00.017 --> 00:03:01.719
Ouch!

57
00:03:01.753 --> 00:03:02.820
Ow.

58
00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:05.957
- No.
- What?


59
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.825
- Stop.
- Keep going?


60
00:03:09.426 --> 00:03:10.995
- Oh, I make you so wet!
- You a good boy?


61
00:03:11.028 --> 00:03:12.897
You gonna do everything
I tell you to do?


62
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:13.865
- Yeah.
- Yeah?


63
00:03:13.898 --> 00:03:14.732
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?


64
00:03:14.766 --> 00:03:16.500
- Yes.
- Okay, keep fucking me, then.


65
00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:18.836
Harder, you little bitch!

66
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.905
Always such a fucking pussy!

67
00:03:20.938 --> 00:03:22.439
Fucking me.

68
00:03:22.472 --> 00:03:23.708
Don't come yet.

69
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:25.542
- Hold it in!
- Oh, I'm so close!


70
00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:28.713
Oh, I'm sorry!

71
00:03:45.797 --> 00:03:48.331
All right.

72
00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.604
Oh, man.

73
00:04:00.945 --> 00:04:06.651
Um... yeah, can I get
a white chocolate mocha...


74
00:04:06.684 --> 00:04:08.552
decaf?

75
00:04:08.586 --> 00:04:12.957
Oh, and with skim milk,
not regular milk.


76
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:14.558
Size?

77
00:04:14.592 --> 00:04:16.359
Um...

78
00:04:20.698 --> 00:04:21.933
Medium.

79
00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:24.401
Oh wait, no, no... large.

80
00:04:24.434 --> 00:04:25.903
Actually...

81
00:04:27.404 --> 00:04:30.107
Can I get a medium
in a large cup


82
00:04:30.141 --> 00:04:33.510
with extra whipped cream?

83
00:04:35.947 --> 00:04:38.749
Yeah, sure.
Anything else?


84
00:04:38.783 --> 00:04:41.986
Oh yeah. Can I get
one of those low-cal bagels?


85
00:04:44.421 --> 00:04:47.658
Oh, um, the freshest one?

86
00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:52.063
No... not that one.
The one in the back.


87
00:04:53.798 --> 00:04:55.967
Hey, man, you wanna
do your job?


88
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.902
I'm trying to get an education,

89
00:04:57.935 --> 00:04:59.871
make a better life for myself.

90
00:04:59.904 --> 00:05:02.006
- You're reading manga.
- Yeah.


91
00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.075
- Hm.
- Does that turn you on?


92
00:05:04.108 --> 00:05:06.978
A cultured man reading
Japanese literature?


93
00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:09.714
My vagina has literally
never been so dry.


94
00:05:09.747 --> 00:05:10.681
I'm into that.

95
00:05:10.715 --> 00:05:12.683
- Just like...
- Fine.


96
00:05:12.717 --> 00:05:14.451
Sage?

97
00:05:14.484 --> 00:05:15.820
A word.

98
00:05:15.853 --> 00:05:16.988
Kyle.

99
00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:23.060
Sage, it's all about keeping
the order side of the cup


100
00:05:23.094 --> 00:05:24.862
facing out.

101
00:05:24.896 --> 00:05:27.832
Expedited service,
keeping it smooth, slick.


102
00:05:27.865 --> 00:05:32.502
After all, we are
a well-oiled machine.


103
00:05:32.535 --> 00:05:33.871
- Yes.
- Got it.


104
00:05:33.905 --> 00:05:37.708
Good, good, good.
Also... ahem...


105
00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:40.443
We need to discuss
your upsell tactics?


106
00:05:40.477 --> 00:05:41.178
Mm-hm.

107
00:05:42.847 --> 00:05:46.918
You know, this was brewed
by Somalian street orphans.


108
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:50.588
Lot of children had to die
for this coffee.


109
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:53.224
Here.

110
00:05:53.257 --> 00:05:55.826
Take it.
It's yours.


111
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.662
Take it.

112
00:05:57.695 --> 00:05:58.829
Goodbye.

113
00:05:58.863 --> 00:06:00.563
Enjoy!

114
00:06:00.598 --> 00:06:03.000
Think about it like
carpe diem.


115
00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:04.936
Seize the opportunity.

116
00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.505
Make them want
what they don't have.


117
00:06:08.538 --> 00:06:09.607
We're a model store.

118
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.876
Other locations
look up to us.


119
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:13.644
I mean, it's like
we are delivering


120
00:06:13.678 --> 00:06:15.713
the opiate of the masses.

121
00:06:15.746 --> 00:06:18.481
It's... it's a domino effect,

122
00:06:18.515 --> 00:06:21.852
really.

123
00:06:21.886 --> 00:06:24.021
Okay.

124
00:06:24.055 --> 00:06:25.089
- Was that it?
- Yeah, that's all,


125
00:06:25.122 --> 00:06:27.557
back to the register.

126
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.261
All right, people,
let's keep it moving.


127
00:06:40.137 --> 00:06:41.238
Hey, Sage!

128
00:06:41.272 --> 00:06:43.674
C'mere, come on.

129
00:06:43.708 --> 00:06:45.943
I just... I don't want
you to forget


130
00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:49.647
to wipe down the tables,
so...


131
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.615
this is for you!

132
00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:54.685
I hope you choke on your vomit
and die in your sleep.


133
00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:56.854
Stop flirting with me
in the workplace.


134
00:06:56.887 --> 00:06:58.756
This is a sacred environment!

135
00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:00.791
Fine! I'll go out with you!

136
00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:01.993
Come back.
Please come back.


137
00:07:02.026 --> 00:07:03.160
No.

138
00:07:05.663 --> 00:07:09.000
I really can't tell
if I'm turned on


139
00:07:09.033 --> 00:07:10.968
or if I wanna, like,
gouge out his eyes


140
00:07:11.002 --> 00:07:12.970
and force-feed him
his own testicles, you know?


141
00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:14.972
Ooh! That, I can
get on board with.


142
00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:16.539
How many times
is he gonna upset you


143
00:07:16.574 --> 00:07:19.010
before you realize
you just gotta move on?


144
00:07:19.043 --> 00:07:20.311
I suck at this game.

145
00:07:20.344 --> 00:07:22.079
You gotta give
more hand jobs.


146
00:07:22.113 --> 00:07:24.582
Exercise that wrist.

147
00:07:24.615 --> 00:07:26.717
- Nobody likes hand jobs.
- Whoa.


148
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:28.285
Seventh-graders like hand jobs.

149
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:29.587
That's true.

150
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.222
- Ew.
- You could masturbate.


151
00:07:31.255 --> 00:07:32.923
I hate masturbating.

152
00:07:34.725 --> 00:07:35.693
What did you say?

153
00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:36.961
My arm gets tired.

154
00:07:36.994 --> 00:07:38.129
Better start
flickin' that clit.


155
00:07:38.162 --> 00:07:39.663
Ew, stop!

156
00:07:39.697 --> 00:07:40.731
You really need
to get more comfortable


157
00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:42.099
with your sexuality.

158
00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:43.734
It has nothing to do
with my sexuality.


159
00:07:43.768 --> 00:07:45.236
I just don't like that word.

160
00:07:45.269 --> 00:07:47.071
- "Clit"?
- Yes.


161
00:07:47.104 --> 00:07:48.706
Or it really might be
your sexuality.


162
00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:51.075
- Thank you.
- I love sex!


163
00:07:51.108 --> 00:07:54.178
Cum! Penis! Vagina! Areola!

164
00:07:54.211 --> 00:07:55.212
Tip of the dick!

165
00:07:55.246 --> 00:07:56.981
I don't fuckin' know,
I just don't like


166
00:07:57.014 --> 00:07:58.716
that specific word.

167
00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:02.620
Oh, shit!

168
00:08:02.653 --> 00:08:03.821
Eight!

169
00:08:03.854 --> 00:08:05.856
Sorry, Casey, you lose.

170
00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:09.894
So you can swallow jizz
but you can't take down


171
00:08:09.927 --> 00:08:12.229
two ounces of tequila?

172
00:08:12.263 --> 00:08:14.632
I don't swallow.

173
00:08:17.101 --> 00:08:18.903
What do you do in bed?

174
00:08:20.838 --> 00:08:22.239
You swallow?

175
00:08:22.273 --> 00:08:23.707
Duh.

176
00:08:26.911 --> 00:08:28.245
Do you swallow?

177
00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:31.382
It depends on the guy, but...
yeah.


178
00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:35.719
I mean, the consistency!
It's like...


179
00:08:35.753 --> 00:08:37.655
melted rubber.

180
00:08:37.688 --> 00:08:40.124
That's why you gotta...
deep-throat


181
00:08:40.157 --> 00:08:41.692
and just let it shoot back.

182
00:08:41.725 --> 00:08:43.294
It also sounds like
he might be eating something


183
00:08:43.327 --> 00:08:44.495
that he should not be eating.

184
00:08:44.528 --> 00:08:46.297
I don't know, I think
I'm just not a texture person


185
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.565
or something.

186
00:08:47.598 --> 00:08:50.401
You can't complain about cum
until you've had Jason Michaels


187
00:08:50.434 --> 00:08:52.269
blow his wad all over you.

188
00:08:53.971 --> 00:08:55.206
I forgot about Jason.

189
00:08:55.239 --> 00:08:57.708
- Who was Jason?
- Junk jizz.


190
00:08:57.741 --> 00:09:00.311
A piece of jizz literally
flew out of his dick


191
00:09:00.344 --> 00:09:02.680
onto my hand.

192
00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:05.683
Like the peelable glue
that you get


193
00:09:05.716 --> 00:09:08.285
in magazine perfume samples.

194
00:09:11.255 --> 00:09:12.690
That's repulsive.

195
00:09:12.723 --> 00:09:13.858
Not as bad
as Colgate jizz.


196
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:15.259
- Debatable.
- No!


197
00:09:15.292 --> 00:09:16.861
- Yes!
- It's so much worse!


198
00:09:16.894 --> 00:09:17.828
- Go.
- Okay.


199
00:09:17.862 --> 00:09:19.263
This guy, when he came,
it was literally like


200
00:09:19.296 --> 00:09:20.498
squeezing a tube of toothpaste.

201
00:09:20.531 --> 00:09:25.202
The jizz just, like, spiraled
out of the tip of his dick.


202
00:09:25.236 --> 00:09:26.770
Does that sound right to you?

203
00:09:26.804 --> 00:09:28.205
Does that sound right
to you?


204
00:09:28.239 --> 00:09:31.342
- That is rich.
- Gross adjectives.


205
00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:33.043
Why do you guys
do this to me?


206
00:09:33.077 --> 00:09:34.845
And now you have rubber jizz,
so, you know,


207
00:09:34.879 --> 00:09:36.747
it's like we're a team.

208
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.449
Worst league ever.

209
00:09:38.482 --> 00:09:40.918
Whatever, man.

210
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:42.386
- Oh, fuck!
- What?


211
00:09:42.419 --> 00:09:44.355
I need to start handling
my own prints,


212
00:09:44.388 --> 00:09:47.124
because I'm making, like,
$2 through a third party.


213
00:09:47.158 --> 00:09:48.392
It's a total scam.

214
00:09:48.425 --> 00:09:49.493
- Hm.
- Well, better start wearing


215
00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:52.463
low-cut shirts to work
and rack up that tip money.


216
00:09:52.496 --> 00:09:55.199
Okay, yeah, first of all,
I don't have boobs,


217
00:09:55.232 --> 00:09:56.901
if you didn't notice;
secondly,


218
00:09:56.934 --> 00:09:58.335
please do not bring up work.

219
00:09:58.369 --> 00:09:59.403
I'll drink to that.

220
00:09:59.436 --> 00:10:02.006
What? I thought the
publishing house was going well.


221
00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:05.176
An unpaid internship's
not really helping with rent.


222
00:10:05.209 --> 00:10:06.377
You're still interning?

223
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:07.511
I guess they're hesitant
to move someone up


224
00:10:07.545 --> 00:10:11.182
with no college credentials
and a late-in-life GED.


225
00:10:11.215 --> 00:10:13.083
I have a degree
and I serve coffee for a living,


226
00:10:13.117 --> 00:10:14.885
if that makes you feel better.

227
00:10:14.919 --> 00:10:16.820
It does! Thank you.

228
00:10:16.854 --> 00:10:18.355
Yeah, but that's an art degree.

229
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:20.224
Wow.

230
00:10:20.257 --> 00:10:22.459
Thank you for putting my failure
into perspective.


231
00:10:22.493 --> 00:10:25.196
Okay, I didn't mean it
like that.


232
00:10:25.229 --> 00:10:27.298
I just...

233
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:28.966
There's no, like,
set career path.


234
00:10:28.999 --> 00:10:30.734
Oh, believe me, I would much
rather have a career


235
00:10:30.768 --> 00:10:33.437
with a path as clear-cut
as selling insurance.


236
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.172
Okay.

237
00:10:35.206 --> 00:10:37.274
It's a transitional job.

238
00:10:37.308 --> 00:10:39.310
And it pays well.

239
00:10:39.343 --> 00:10:41.245
Not that that money's
actually enjoyed.


240
00:10:41.278 --> 00:10:42.846
I love your dad,

241
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.281
but he's draining you dry,
honey.


242
00:10:44.315 --> 00:10:46.784
And how, exactly,
are you paying for things?


243
00:10:46.817 --> 00:10:48.719
- Savings.
- Hm.


244
00:10:49.887 --> 00:10:51.822
I don't have a lot of time.

245
00:10:51.855 --> 00:10:54.024
My conference is in 20 minutes.

246
00:10:54.058 --> 00:10:56.293
That's plenty.

247
00:10:56.327 --> 00:10:57.461
Sit down.

248
00:11:09.273 --> 00:11:10.941
Take off my pants.

249
00:11:29.827 --> 00:11:31.895
- Oh no, I'm good, thank you.
- Drink it.


250
00:11:38.102 --> 00:11:40.371
Look at me.

251
00:11:40.404 --> 00:11:41.805
Yeah.

252
00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:45.109
Just like that.

253
00:11:45.142 --> 00:11:46.243
Keep drinking.

254
00:11:50.481 --> 00:11:53.150
Tastes good, doesn't it?

255
00:11:53.183 --> 00:11:56.588
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.


256
00:12:10.901 --> 00:12:14.471
Stop! Don't swallow!

257
00:12:14.505 --> 00:12:16.206
Oh, God!

258
00:12:18.242 --> 00:12:19.977
Slap me.

259
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.515
Harder.

260
00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:27.585
Hit me again.

261
00:12:27.619 --> 00:12:30.120
Hit me again!

262
00:12:30.154 --> 00:12:31.322
Now, the water!

263
00:12:31.355 --> 00:12:33.057
Spit it in my face!

264
00:12:50.575 --> 00:12:52.343
You can go now.

265
00:13:20.404 --> 00:13:21.673
There you go.

266
00:13:27.244 --> 00:13:31.048
I think it's best to keep
a positive perspective.


267
00:13:31.081 --> 00:13:32.549
I know this feels like
a low point,


268
00:13:32.584 --> 00:13:36.588
but perhaps this could be
a renewed beginning.


269
00:13:36.621 --> 00:13:38.021
If you'd like to come in
twice a week,


270
00:13:38.055 --> 00:13:40.124
I do have an opening
on Thursdays.


271
00:15:57.194 --> 00:16:00.297
Medium latte,
triple shot, iced.


272
00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:01.599
Ahem!

273
00:16:08.272 --> 00:16:09.807
Are you sure
you wouldn't like a large


274
00:16:09.841 --> 00:16:12.175
for just 25 cents more?

275
00:16:15.112 --> 00:16:16.781
I'm sure that
I'd like a medium.


276
00:16:16.814 --> 00:16:18.382
Because if I wanted a large,

277
00:16:18.415 --> 00:16:20.117
I would have ordered a large.

278
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:21.485
And I'm also sure
that I can't be late


279
00:16:21.518 --> 00:16:23.420
to a very important meeting,
so,


280
00:16:23.453 --> 00:16:25.757
if you could do your job
quickly


281
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.792
and get me the medium iced latte
I ordered,


282
00:16:27.825 --> 00:16:30.394
I can give you this as a tip

283
00:16:30.427 --> 00:16:32.329
and we can say our goodbyes.

284
00:16:34.832 --> 00:16:37.200
Okay.

285
00:16:37.234 --> 00:16:38.836
Anything else?

286
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.248
Thanks.

287
00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.789
- Hello.
- Hi.


288
00:16:57.822 --> 00:16:59.323
Are you gonna help us close?

289
00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:00.825
Uh, no thanks.

290
00:17:00.858 --> 00:17:01.793
Okay, cool!

291
00:17:01.826 --> 00:17:05.462
Just remember,
drive fast and take chances!


292
00:17:08.398 --> 00:17:09.533
Here.

293
00:17:11.234 --> 00:17:13.370
That is a solid amount of cash
to be flaunting.


294
00:17:13.403 --> 00:17:16.641
Don't get overzealous
and spend it all in one place.


295
00:17:16.674 --> 00:17:18.710
- Seventeen dollars?
- America.


296
00:17:18.743 --> 00:17:20.210
Land of opportunity.

297
00:17:20.243 --> 00:17:21.713
No, I'm excited.

298
00:17:21.746 --> 00:17:23.380
It's the exact down payment
I needed for my ad, actually,


299
00:17:23.413 --> 00:17:24.816
so...

300
00:17:24.849 --> 00:17:25.883
Ha-ha! Hard work
really does pay off.


301
00:17:25.917 --> 00:17:28.185
It does!

302
00:17:28.218 --> 00:17:29.519
So.

303
00:17:29.553 --> 00:17:30.554
How's the art stuff?

304
00:17:30.588 --> 00:17:33.591
It's good, it's a nice,
consistent reminder


305
00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:35.827
of my unfulfilled potential.

306
00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.494
So I should expect
to see your work at the Getty


307
00:17:37.527 --> 00:17:38.763
in the near future.

308
00:17:38.796 --> 00:17:40.530
Oh yeah, any day now.

309
00:17:40.564 --> 00:17:42.332
You know, I really hope
they display the one


310
00:17:42.366 --> 00:17:44.936
with the, uh, Grim Reaper
and the coffee cup,


311
00:17:44.969 --> 00:17:47.337
I think that's my favorite.

312
00:17:47.371 --> 00:17:48.238
You asshole.

313
00:17:48.271 --> 00:17:50.575
I couldn't help myself.

314
00:17:50.608 --> 00:17:51.743
I'm sorry!

315
00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:54.411
I saw an opportunity while
you were cleaning the bathroom!


316
00:17:54.444 --> 00:17:55.813
You're triggering
some very sensitive issues


317
00:17:55.847 --> 00:17:57.514
from my childhood right now,
please stop.


318
00:17:57.547 --> 00:17:58.415
Please stop.

319
00:17:58.448 --> 00:17:59.416
Ew! Get that out of my face
right now.


320
00:17:59.449 --> 00:18:00.484
I'm serious.

321
00:18:00.517 --> 00:18:01.819
No, you made
a very serious mistake.


322
00:18:01.853 --> 00:18:03.821
Okay. I have acne-prone skin.

323
00:18:03.855 --> 00:18:04.922
Why is it red?

324
00:18:04.956 --> 00:18:06.390
Because I used it to clean up
the menstrual blood


325
00:18:06.423 --> 00:18:07.625
in the women's stall.

326
00:18:07.659 --> 00:18:09.861
What the fuck? No! Ew! No!

327
00:18:09.894 --> 00:18:12.229
No, and my guess is
I'll really have you...


328
00:18:12.262 --> 00:18:13.865
Okay, please, I will do anything
to make it up to you.


329
00:18:13.898 --> 00:18:15.967
- Please stop!
- It's too late for that.


330
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.235
Okay, I have a bowl
in the back!


331
00:18:26.811 --> 00:18:28.579
Can I hit that yet?

332
00:18:29.947 --> 00:18:32.482
Nope.

333
00:18:32.516 --> 00:18:34.484
Can't believe you were gonna
wipe period on my face.


334
00:18:34.518 --> 00:18:36.486
It was strawberry syrup,
relax.


335
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.589
You think I'd touch that rag?

336
00:18:41.693 --> 00:18:44.294
Your work really is great.

337
00:18:44.327 --> 00:18:47.832
Yeah, well, you and Edna
seem to be the only two people


338
00:18:47.865 --> 00:18:49.734
that think that, so...

339
00:18:49.767 --> 00:18:51.234
- Edna?
- Oh yeah.


340
00:18:51.268 --> 00:18:53.336
She's a repeat Etsy customer
I have.


341
00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:56.908
She's, like, 60, has a parrot,
and is a devout Wiccan,


342
00:18:56.941 --> 00:18:58.508
according to her profile.

343
00:18:58.542 --> 00:19:00.978
Whoa.

344
00:19:01.012 --> 00:19:03.881
Hey, at least you know
you have a wide target audience.


345
00:19:03.915 --> 00:19:05.950
I really think you should make,
like,


346
00:19:05.983 --> 00:19:09.620
a coffee table book
or something, you know?


347
00:19:09.654 --> 00:19:11.555
Yeah, and then sell it
to Urban Outfitters


348
00:19:11.589 --> 00:19:13.523
so edgy teens can purchase it?

349
00:19:13.557 --> 00:19:14.926
- Totally.
- Fuck you, I'm being serious.


350
00:19:14.959 --> 00:19:17.628
You can put, like, little
witty one-liners underneath.


351
00:19:17.662 --> 00:19:18.963
It'd be cool.

352
00:19:18.996 --> 00:19:21.331
No more input from you.

353
00:19:21.364 --> 00:19:24.736
Look. I'm just trying to keep
the artistic spirit alive.


354
00:19:24.769 --> 00:19:27.337
And I, for one, appreciate
your dark sense of humor.


355
00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.741
It reminds me of this director
I've been getting into.


356
00:19:29.774 --> 00:19:31.576
He just did a movie
about a widowed mortician


357
00:19:31.609 --> 00:19:33.611
that falls in love
with one of his corpses,


358
00:19:33.644 --> 00:19:36.546
and, um, well, they're actually
screening it this week,


359
00:19:36.581 --> 00:19:38.381
- I wanted to...
- No.


360
00:19:38.415 --> 00:19:39.751
Yeah, I mean, I get it,
you don't want to spend


361
00:19:39.784 --> 00:19:41.819
your hard-earned money
on movie tickets.


362
00:19:41.853 --> 00:19:44.021
Which, uh, happens
to work out perfectly,


363
00:19:44.055 --> 00:19:45.690
considering
I have two tickets.


364
00:19:45.723 --> 00:19:46.858
Kyle!

365
00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:49.761
- I know what you're gonna say.
- I don't date.


366
00:19:49.794 --> 00:19:50.862
Right.

367
00:19:50.895 --> 00:19:52.597
That's what I was getting to.

368
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:53.765
And I also don't like
saying no,


369
00:19:53.798 --> 00:19:56.667
so the less you ask,
the less I'll have to do that.


370
00:19:56.701 --> 00:19:58.368
For sure, for sure.

371
00:19:58.401 --> 00:20:00.872
Look. I respect
your life choices.


372
00:20:00.905 --> 00:20:02.974
I, um, I just think
you're missing


373
00:20:03.007 --> 00:20:04.809
a profound opportunity.

374
00:20:04.842 --> 00:20:07.578
Opportunity leads
to disappointment.


375
00:20:07.612 --> 00:20:09.580
See, and then you say
stuff like that


376
00:20:09.614 --> 00:20:12.650
and you lead me on
and it's cruel.


377
00:20:14.819 --> 00:20:16.419
It's not you.

378
00:20:16.453 --> 00:20:19.523
You know that.

379
00:20:19.556 --> 00:20:20.792
What?

380
00:20:24.427 --> 00:20:26.496
Okay.

381
00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:27.999
We flirt, right?

382
00:20:28.032 --> 00:20:28.933
We hook up.

383
00:20:28.966 --> 00:20:29.867
We date for two years.

384
00:20:29.901 --> 00:20:31.035
Shit hits the fan,

385
00:20:31.068 --> 00:20:33.070
we take another two years
to call it off, and by then,


386
00:20:33.104 --> 00:20:35.773
we're, like, 30
with nothing but wasted time,


387
00:20:35.807 --> 00:20:37.340
wasted youth,
wasted emotions,


388
00:20:37.374 --> 00:20:41.679
and we've totally
fucked each other up.


389
00:20:41.712 --> 00:20:47.118
I was thinking maybe we start
with bowling or something?


390
00:20:47.151 --> 00:20:48.786
Hey, I'll let you
think about it.


391
00:20:50.154 --> 00:20:51.222
You can finish that, I'm good.

392
00:20:51.255 --> 00:20:55.693
I'm gonna go mop up
back of house or something.


393
00:21:42.073 --> 00:21:44.507
Hello, excuse me, excuse me!

394
00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:48.545
- Did she notice?
- Nah, girl. You're good.


395
00:21:48.579 --> 00:21:50.081
Trish, you are
a fucking angel.


396
00:21:50.114 --> 00:21:52.817
I know.

397
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:53.784
Hi!

398
00:21:53.818 --> 00:21:55.485
Hi.

399
00:21:55.518 --> 00:21:57.889
Sorry, I get really sucked in
when I'm reading.


400
00:21:57.922 --> 00:21:59.556
You must be Margaret.

401
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.524
- Morgan.
- Morgan, yes... no, sorry.


402
00:22:01.558 --> 00:22:03.928
I know I knew that.

403
00:22:03.961 --> 00:22:07.430
- Fuck!
- That's okay. Close enough.


404
00:22:10.001 --> 00:22:11.135
And you are?

405
00:22:11.168 --> 00:22:13.536
Oh, Myles.

406
00:22:13.570 --> 00:22:16.974
I'm gonna be interning
with you guys... girls, girls.


407
00:22:17.008 --> 00:22:20.011
- Female girls.
- Cool!


408
00:22:20.044 --> 00:22:21.478
What happened to Amy?

409
00:22:21.511 --> 00:22:22.847
They moved her
to the assistant position


410
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.016
in Young Adult,
lucky bitch.


411
00:22:25.049 --> 00:22:26.817
Good for her, though!

412
00:22:26.851 --> 00:22:29.053
I
-I
-I meant, like, uh,

413
00:22:29.086 --> 00:22:32.223
women advancing
and the glass ceiling, and...


414
00:22:32.256 --> 00:22:33.891
Myles.

415
00:22:33.925 --> 00:22:35.126
Shut the fuck up.

416
00:22:35.159 --> 00:22:37.595
Okay.

417
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:46.237
Olivia?

418
00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.739
Alan?

419
00:22:48.773 --> 00:22:50.775
Come on in.

420
00:22:55.179 --> 00:22:58.082
Make yourself comfortable.

421
00:23:21.839 --> 00:23:26.110
So, Alan.

422
00:23:26.143 --> 00:23:28.713
What do you want?

423
00:23:28.746 --> 00:23:31.282
Oh boy, um...

424
00:23:31.315 --> 00:23:34.852
I'm not entirely sure, uh...

425
00:23:34.885 --> 00:23:42.093
I do have some ideas,
but I've...


426
00:23:42.126 --> 00:23:44.929
I've never done this before.

427
00:23:44.962 --> 00:23:46.731
Shy, huh?

428
00:23:46.764 --> 00:23:48.599
I like that.

429
00:23:48.632 --> 00:23:51.035
Don't be nervous.

430
00:23:51.068 --> 00:23:54.105
We'll work through it
together.


431
00:23:54.138 --> 00:23:56.040
Let's start at the beginning.

432
00:23:56.073 --> 00:23:58.976
How do you like it?

433
00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.612
Hard or soft?

434
00:24:01.645 --> 00:24:02.980
Hard.

435
00:24:03.014 --> 00:24:04.749
Hard and fast
or hard and slow?


436
00:24:04.782 --> 00:24:06.851
Oh, hard and slow.

437
00:24:06.884 --> 00:24:11.822
- I like hard and slow, too.
- That's... that's great.


438
00:24:11.856 --> 00:24:14.058
Close your eyes for me.

439
00:24:19.296 --> 00:24:23.234
I want you to tell me exactly
what you want to do to me.


440
00:24:23.267 --> 00:24:26.971
Okay?

441
00:24:27.004 --> 00:24:28.906
Okay.

442
00:24:32.009 --> 00:24:35.746
We're on the bed,

443
00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:42.186
and you're stroking my knee.

444
00:24:46.924 --> 00:24:48.692
It tickles.

445
00:24:48.726 --> 00:24:50.227
Do you like it
when I stroke your knee?


446
00:24:50.261 --> 00:24:53.064
I like it
when you stroke my knee.


447
00:24:53.097 --> 00:24:55.733
What else am I doing
that you like?


448
00:24:55.766 --> 00:24:58.936
You unbutton my shirt,

449
00:24:58.969 --> 00:25:04.175
and then you...
you take it off,


450
00:25:04.208 --> 00:25:10.915
and then my pants,
you take those off too.


451
00:25:10.948 --> 00:25:15.953
And then... and then,
you take your clothes off.


452
00:25:15.986 --> 00:25:21.625
So now,
no one's wearing clothes.


453
00:25:21.659 --> 00:25:24.328
And...

454
00:25:24.361 --> 00:25:28.833
and then,
you kiss me,


455
00:25:28.866 --> 00:25:37.641
and you kiss the...
the tip of my penis,


456
00:25:37.675 --> 00:25:44.248
and you lick it,
you lick it with your tongue.


457
00:25:44.281 --> 00:25:48.285
And you're sucking on it,

458
00:25:48.319 --> 00:25:50.821
and you're gagging.

459
00:25:50.855 --> 00:25:52.389
You're gagging so loud,

460
00:25:52.423 --> 00:25:56.694
and I slap you in the face
with it.


461
00:25:56.727 --> 00:25:58.829
I dick-slap you
right in the face,


462
00:25:58.863 --> 00:26:01.432
and you say,
"Oh, slap me again, Daddy,


463
00:26:01.465 --> 00:26:04.201
with your big, fat cock!"

464
00:26:04.235 --> 00:26:07.004
And so I do.

465
00:26:07.037 --> 00:26:09.707
And then I grab you
by the back of the hair


466
00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.809
and I pull you up

467
00:26:11.842 --> 00:26:16.113
and I press your face
against the wall


468
00:26:16.147 --> 00:26:19.850
and I tell you
what a bad girl you've been.


469
00:26:19.884 --> 00:26:22.920
And you beg me
not to punish you,


470
00:26:22.953 --> 00:26:26.390
but bad girls need
to get punished.


471
00:26:26.423 --> 00:26:28.359
So I spank you,

472
00:26:28.392 --> 00:26:30.995
I spank you so hard,

473
00:26:31.028 --> 00:26:33.397
and you say,
"I'll be a good girl, Daddy,


474
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.332
I promise!"

475
00:26:35.366 --> 00:26:38.469
And I say, "That's what
you said last time.


476
00:26:38.502 --> 00:26:41.172
You need to learn your lesson,

477
00:26:41.205 --> 00:26:44.041
and I'm gonna
fuck it into you."


478
00:26:44.074 --> 00:26:46.343
So that's what I do.

479
00:26:46.377 --> 00:26:48.012
I bend you over

480
00:26:48.045 --> 00:26:50.181
and I'm fucking you
with my big cock,


481
00:26:50.214 --> 00:26:54.351
and your cum
is dripping down my balls,


482
00:26:54.385 --> 00:26:58.322
and you're moaning
and I'm spanking you


483
00:26:58.355 --> 00:27:00.457
and I'm choking you,

484
00:27:00.491 --> 00:27:03.727
hitting your head
against the wall,


485
00:27:03.761 --> 00:27:05.763
and then I cum.

486
00:27:05.796 --> 00:27:09.500
I cum so hard,
it shoots all over your face.


487
00:27:09.533 --> 00:27:12.169
And it's in your eyes,

488
00:27:12.203 --> 00:27:14.738
and it's dripping
down your nose,


489
00:27:14.772 --> 00:27:18.309
and it's all over
the filthy bathroom.


490
00:27:18.342 --> 00:27:20.878
And I look at you
and I say,


491
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:24.215
"Look at the mess you made,
you dirty little bitch.


492
00:27:24.248 --> 00:27:27.051
Clean it up."

493
00:27:31.288 --> 00:27:34.858
So was it as good
as the last time?


494
00:27:34.892 --> 00:27:36.994
Excuse me?

495
00:27:37.027 --> 00:27:38.495
Uh, the food.

496
00:27:38.529 --> 00:27:39.964
Full disclosure:

497
00:27:39.997 --> 00:27:41.031
I'm not trying to be creepy.

498
00:27:41.065 --> 00:27:42.132
I saw you here
the other day


499
00:27:42.166 --> 00:27:43.200
and I was gonna say something,

500
00:27:43.234 --> 00:27:44.969
but then I didn't,

501
00:27:45.002 --> 00:27:47.838
because I kinda find you
incredibly intimidating.


502
00:27:47.871 --> 00:27:49.807
You think I'm intimidating.

503
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.509
- Very much so.
- Wow.


504
00:27:52.543 --> 00:27:54.411
That's some poor judgment.

505
00:27:54.445 --> 00:27:57.181
No, I think you need
to give yourself more credit.


506
00:27:57.214 --> 00:27:58.949
Well, I can't be
that intimidating


507
00:27:58.983 --> 00:28:00.918
with the quick turnaround.

508
00:28:00.951 --> 00:28:02.152
Oh... no, I had a beer.

509
00:28:02.186 --> 00:28:06.090
- Ah. The truth comes out.
- So it does.


510
00:28:11.996 --> 00:28:13.797
I'm Lowick.

511
00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:15.032
Morgan.

512
00:28:15.065 --> 00:28:16.433
Just so you know,

513
00:28:16.467 --> 00:28:19.403
I kinda consider myself
a pho connoisseur.


514
00:28:19.436 --> 00:28:22.940
That is...
that is painfully dorky.


515
00:28:22.973 --> 00:28:24.008
Speaking of,

516
00:28:24.041 --> 00:28:26.810
you are more than welcome
to come sit over here,


517
00:28:26.844 --> 00:28:28.245
if you want.

518
00:28:28.279 --> 00:28:29.546
Because you're eating alone

519
00:28:29.581 --> 00:28:32.349
and you look like
a total loser.


520
00:28:32.383 --> 00:28:34.586
You're eating alone.

521
00:28:34.619 --> 00:28:35.986
Well, yeah, but I already have
the whole dork thing


522
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.187
going on pretty strong,

523
00:28:37.221 --> 00:28:38.989
so loser suits me.

524
00:28:39.023 --> 00:28:40.858
I do like sports, though.

525
00:28:40.891 --> 00:28:43.027
- I don't think that helps.
- Shit.


526
00:28:48.499 --> 00:28:50.234
You know what?

527
00:28:50.267 --> 00:28:52.102
Just forget I said anything.

528
00:28:52.136 --> 00:28:56.106
Or I... you look like
you've had a hard week.


529
00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:58.175
So I'm... I'm gonna come
over there with this.


530
00:29:04.281 --> 00:29:05.316
Hi!

531
00:29:05.349 --> 00:29:08.485
Hi.

532
00:29:08.519 --> 00:29:10.854
- You know what's crazy?
- What?


533
00:29:10.888 --> 00:29:12.523
Sitting at a table
with another human being


534
00:29:12.556 --> 00:29:14.892
can make you feel so much better
about your life.


535
00:29:16.927 --> 00:29:18.262
So what happened?

536
00:29:18.295 --> 00:29:20.130
With what?

537
00:29:20.164 --> 00:29:21.465
You know. Your day.

538
00:29:21.498 --> 00:29:22.533
You look like
you had a hard day,


539
00:29:22.566 --> 00:29:24.234
and we've established
it can't possibly be


540
00:29:24.268 --> 00:29:26.003
about the food.

541
00:29:26.036 --> 00:29:27.338
Just work stuff.

542
00:29:27.371 --> 00:29:29.239
Mm. I get that.

543
00:29:29.273 --> 00:29:31.909
Work can be a pain in the ass.

544
00:29:31.942 --> 00:29:34.111
You have no idea.

545
00:29:34.144 --> 00:29:35.312
Why? What do you do?

546
00:29:35.346 --> 00:29:36.280
It's lame.

547
00:29:36.313 --> 00:29:37.948
Oh my God.

548
00:29:37.981 --> 00:29:39.651
- You just lied to me.
- No I didn't.


549
00:29:39.684 --> 00:29:41.318
We just shared
our first lie,


550
00:29:41.352 --> 00:29:42.953
and it came
from your mouth.


551
00:29:42.986 --> 00:29:44.221
- No!
- Here's the thing about lying.


552
00:29:44.254 --> 00:29:46.056
Lying is something
that I do not mess around with,


553
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:47.091
me personally.

554
00:29:47.124 --> 00:29:48.425
If this is something
we're gonna continue...


555
00:29:48.459 --> 00:29:49.560
"This"?

556
00:29:49.594 --> 00:29:51.161
Yeah, eating
at the same restaurant.


557
00:29:51.195 --> 00:29:52.396
Got it.

558
00:29:52.429 --> 00:29:56.133
Then I'm gonna need you to be
completely honest with me.


559
00:29:56.166 --> 00:29:58.902
I think I can manage that.

560
00:29:58.936 --> 00:30:00.672
So, Morgan.

561
00:30:00.705 --> 00:30:03.407
- Yes.
- What do you do?


562
00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.476
I'm an almost-publisher.

563
00:30:05.509 --> 00:30:07.244
- Mm.
- Mm.


564
00:30:07.277 --> 00:30:08.479
So you just loiter
outside of the building


565
00:30:08.512 --> 00:30:09.681
demanding pay?

566
00:30:09.714 --> 00:30:11.616
- Yes.
- Oh, I'm sorry.


567
00:30:11.649 --> 00:30:15.252
I didn't mean to, uh,
underestimate your position.


568
00:30:15.285 --> 00:30:19.556
Okay. What kind of books
do you pretend-publish?


569
00:30:19.591 --> 00:30:21.191
Fantasy.

570
00:30:24.495 --> 00:30:25.429
Say that again.

571
00:30:25.462 --> 00:30:26.530
Fantasy.

572
00:30:26.563 --> 00:30:28.065
- No, I heard you the first time.
- Okay.


573
00:30:28.098 --> 00:30:30.234
You were making fun of me
and calling me a loser.


574
00:30:30.267 --> 00:30:32.002
Fantasy can be really cool.

575
00:30:32.035 --> 00:30:33.971
Yeah, if you're
my nine-year-old nephew


576
00:30:34.004 --> 00:30:35.439
and you're in love
with Twilight.


577
00:30:35.472 --> 00:30:36.608
Your nephew likes Twilight?

578
00:30:36.641 --> 00:30:38.075
He loves Twilight.

579
00:30:38.108 --> 00:30:40.077
He's not very popular
with the ladies.


580
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:41.512
Oh. I've got cash.

581
00:30:41.545 --> 00:30:42.580
No, it's fine, I got it.

582
00:30:42.614 --> 00:30:44.415
Put it on the card. Thanks.

583
00:30:44.448 --> 00:30:46.684
You're good, he's gone.

584
00:30:46.718 --> 00:30:48.285
Okay, hm.

585
00:30:48.318 --> 00:30:52.322
What is the best almost-book
you've ever read?


586
00:30:52.356 --> 00:30:55.459
- Really?
- Yeah.


587
00:30:55.492 --> 00:30:58.061
Okay, um...

588
00:30:58.095 --> 00:31:00.497
it's about these two worlds
that exist.


589
00:31:00.531 --> 00:31:02.734
One is well-manicured,
it's for the elite,


590
00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:04.568
and the other one is rural,

591
00:31:04.602 --> 00:31:08.472
- it's incredibly impoverished.
- It's like Elysium.


592
00:31:08.505 --> 00:31:09.574
The Matt Damon movie.

593
00:31:09.607 --> 00:31:11.241
If this is dumb, we really
don't have to do this.


594
00:31:11.275 --> 00:31:13.110
No, keep talking
I'm listening, I'm sorry.


595
00:31:13.143 --> 00:31:14.511
- I'll shut up.
- Yeah? Okay.


596
00:31:14.545 --> 00:31:16.681
So, this child is born
in the second world,


597
00:31:16.714 --> 00:31:19.983
but this mom, she doesn't
want her child to live, like,


598
00:31:20.017 --> 00:31:21.185
through a life of struggles.

599
00:31:21.218 --> 00:31:23.153
So she smuggles the baby
to the first world.


600
00:31:23.187 --> 00:31:24.689
Naturally.

601
00:31:26.624 --> 00:31:27.759
That's it.

602
00:31:27.792 --> 00:31:29.026
That's all you're gonna tell me.

603
00:31:29.059 --> 00:31:30.127
Yes.

604
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.629
You're just gonna leave me
on a cliff like that.


605
00:31:31.663 --> 00:31:33.363
Well, you're engaged, right?

606
00:31:33.397 --> 00:31:35.199
This is like
the end of The Sopranos.


607
00:31:35.232 --> 00:31:37.000
- Well, you're not gonna...
- You just cut to bl...


608
00:31:41.038 --> 00:31:43.307
Seem a little tense, kiddo.

609
00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:45.777
I'm fine.

610
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.511
Work stuff.

611
00:31:47.544 --> 00:31:48.713
I'm telling you,

612
00:31:48.746 --> 00:31:51.114
you have to check out this forum
that I've been attending.


613
00:31:52.349 --> 00:31:54.117
Don't laugh.

614
00:31:54.151 --> 00:31:57.789
Okay? It's about
choosing your happiness, okay?


615
00:31:57.822 --> 00:31:59.423
Being proactive.

616
00:31:59.456 --> 00:32:02.025
None of this manifesting
or meditation bullshit.


617
00:32:02.059 --> 00:32:03.661
I mean, it's real stuff
that you can use


618
00:32:03.695 --> 00:32:05.797
and make an immediate impact
in your life.


619
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:07.765
- Immediate?
- Yeah. Well...


620
00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:10.602
it still takes time
and work, you know,


621
00:32:10.635 --> 00:32:12.169
but it's...
it's really incredible.


622
00:32:12.202 --> 00:32:15.305
No, it sounds like
a pyramid scheme.


623
00:32:15.339 --> 00:32:16.774
It's not...

624
00:32:16.808 --> 00:32:18.542
- Forget it.
- No, I'm sorry, Dad, I'm sorry,


625
00:32:18.576 --> 00:32:22.246
keep telling me
about your cult.


626
00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:24.381
It's not a cult.

627
00:32:24.414 --> 00:32:25.750
Look, all I'm saying is,

628
00:32:25.783 --> 00:32:27.551
it pushes you to get out there

629
00:32:27.585 --> 00:32:29.787
and make the most
of our time here.


630
00:32:29.821 --> 00:32:31.154
Hm.

631
00:32:31.188 --> 00:32:32.389
Did you know

632
00:32:32.422 --> 00:32:34.759
that the chances of us being
who we are,


633
00:32:34.792 --> 00:32:37.361
alive,
right now at this time,


634
00:32:37.394 --> 00:32:39.496
is one in three trillion?

635
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.398
- Oh wow.
- Yeah. Isn't that amazing?


636
00:32:41.431 --> 00:32:43.567
- Can I get you anything else?
- Yeah, another mimosa, please.


637
00:32:43.601 --> 00:32:45.335
Definitely.

638
00:32:45.369 --> 00:32:47.504
- And for you, sir?
- Uh, yeah, um...


639
00:32:47.538 --> 00:32:49.641
I'll just take
some more coffee and, uh...


640
00:32:49.674 --> 00:32:51.609
and the check, please.

641
00:32:51.643 --> 00:32:55.112
- Thank you.
- Thank you.


642
00:32:57.214 --> 00:32:59.316
You can talk to me.

643
00:32:59.349 --> 00:33:01.653
I know. I know!

644
00:33:01.686 --> 00:33:03.253
I know I can.

645
00:33:06.724 --> 00:33:09.092
I love you.

646
00:33:09.126 --> 00:33:11.094
I love you too.

647
00:33:11.128 --> 00:33:12.830
Promise me you'll
check into the forum?


648
00:33:14.431 --> 00:33:17.167
Hey! Thank you,
I got that.


649
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:20.537
Oof. Um, yeah,
got my, uh, cards right here,


650
00:33:20.571 --> 00:33:24.107
packed them, yeah...

651
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:25.275
Wait a second.

652
00:33:25.309 --> 00:33:26.844
Coulda sworn
I put them right here.


653
00:33:26.878 --> 00:33:29.279
I woke up this morning,
I put it in my... yes, I know,


654
00:33:29.313 --> 00:33:32.516
they've gotta be here,
I know they're here.


655
00:33:32.549 --> 00:33:34.752
Dammit.

656
00:33:34.786 --> 00:33:36.553
I put it here,
I know I put it here today,


657
00:33:36.588 --> 00:33:37.689
- I put it right here.
- You know, Dad, totally fine.


658
00:33:37.722 --> 00:33:38.856
- I got it.
- No, no, no, no, no.


659
00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:39.691
- Don't even worry about it.
- A father should be able


660
00:33:39.724 --> 00:33:41.558
to take his daughter
out for lunch.


661
00:33:41.593 --> 00:33:42.559
Just give me one second, please.

662
00:33:42.594 --> 00:33:44.161
- Put it on there...
- I'll take that, please,


663
00:33:44.194 --> 00:33:45.562
just do that.

664
00:33:45.597 --> 00:33:47.865
Dad, totally fine,
not a big deal.


665
00:33:47.899 --> 00:33:50.167
Put that right there,
hold on a second, I think...


666
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.769
ahh!

667
00:33:51.803 --> 00:33:52.837
Forgot I put 'em
in my pants.


668
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.571
- Could you do me a favor?
- Oh, he has two cards.


669
00:33:54.606 --> 00:33:55.707
- Thirty on this one.
- Thirty on that.


670
00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.407
And then the rest on...

671
00:33:57.441 --> 00:33:58.442
- Is that the same card?
- You know what?


672
00:33:58.475 --> 00:33:59.409
He'll pay me back.

673
00:33:59.443 --> 00:34:00.678
- Thank you so much.
- Dad, I was a waiter,


674
00:34:00.712 --> 00:34:01.813
that's really difficult,
please.


675
00:34:01.846 --> 00:34:03.180
- No, it's not!
- Okay, fine.


676
00:34:03.213 --> 00:34:05.515
Oh my God, Dad, please!

677
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:07.184
Here, it's totally fine,
thank you.


678
00:34:07.217 --> 00:34:08.620
You know what? Hey, hey...

679
00:34:10.588 --> 00:34:12.790
It's totally fine.

680
00:34:20.898 --> 00:34:22.199
You didn't have to do that.

681
00:34:22.232 --> 00:34:25.670
Dad, it's fine.

682
00:34:25.703 --> 00:34:27.471
You think I like my daughter
paying for herself


683
00:34:27.504 --> 00:34:29.807
- around me?
- I'm an adult!


684
00:34:29.841 --> 00:34:32.175
It's okay.

685
00:34:32.209 --> 00:34:33.611
Maybe.

686
00:34:33.645 --> 00:34:35.345
But you're still my child.

687
00:34:35.379 --> 00:34:37.280
Okay.

688
00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:41.385
Bottoms up.

689
00:34:51.729 --> 00:34:53.865
Oh my God!

690
00:34:53.898 --> 00:34:55.198
No, that's not true.

691
00:34:55.232 --> 00:34:56.868
No, it's fine, I'm...

692
00:34:59.469 --> 00:35:00.738
No! Somebody's gonna see.

693
00:35:00.772 --> 00:35:02.305
Nobody's gonna see.

694
00:35:02.339 --> 00:35:03.975
- It's gonna be fine.
- Yes, they are!


695
00:35:04.008 --> 00:35:06.276
I'm into it, I'm into it.

696
00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:07.612
My God, no, just come in.

697
00:35:07.645 --> 00:35:08.946
It's a quiet hallway.

698
00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.615
Do you wanna...
do you wanna come in?


699
00:35:10.648 --> 00:35:14.284
Yeah, let's...
let's go inside.


700
00:35:15.452 --> 00:35:17.421
Give me a break.

701
00:35:17.454 --> 00:35:18.656
Come on. Go ahead.

702
00:35:59.429 --> 00:36:00.965
Casey.

703
00:36:00.998 --> 00:36:02.265
It's good to see you.

704
00:36:02.299 --> 00:36:03.433
I thought you were
out of town, Max.


705
00:36:03.467 --> 00:36:04.802
I was.

706
00:36:04.836 --> 00:36:07.437
But I'm back now.

707
00:36:07.471 --> 00:36:08.806
But don't worry,
these walls are...


708
00:36:09.874 --> 00:36:11.743
...pretty thick.

709
00:36:11.776 --> 00:36:13.711
Is Nathan home?

710
00:36:13.745 --> 00:36:15.445
Maybe.

711
00:36:15.479 --> 00:36:17.982
I think he was, uh,
texting some girl.


712
00:36:22.352 --> 00:36:23.553
Hey, sexy.

713
00:36:23.588 --> 00:36:25.522
Hey.

714
00:36:25.555 --> 00:36:27.457
Hey, sexy.

715
00:36:27.491 --> 00:36:29.559
Um, right back at you.

716
00:36:29.594 --> 00:36:30.728
Thank you.

717
00:36:30.762 --> 00:36:32.362
This is a very,

718
00:36:32.395 --> 00:36:34.464
very, very, very,
very pleasant surprise.


719
00:36:34.498 --> 00:36:36.000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


720
00:36:36.033 --> 00:36:38.970
Well, lucky for you
I have another surprise for you.


721
00:36:39.003 --> 00:36:40.303
Gimme your hand.

722
00:36:44.108 --> 00:36:46.476
- No underwear.
- Mm-hm.


723
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:48.411
- Smooth.
- Yeah.


724
00:36:54.018 --> 00:36:56.386
Oh, you're smooth too.

725
00:36:56.419 --> 00:36:58.656
We really gotta work
on our sex talk.


726
00:36:58.689 --> 00:37:01.659
Yeah, we do.

727
00:37:04.962 --> 00:37:07.098
Ow, ow, ow, my ear.

728
00:37:09.566 --> 00:37:10.567
Sorry, sorry.

729
00:37:11.669 --> 00:37:12.904
Good try, yeah.

730
00:37:24.649 --> 00:37:26.918
And one more thing,
just to conclude.


731
00:37:26.951 --> 00:37:29.386
The employee
with the most upsells...


732
00:37:29.419 --> 00:37:31.088
remember, upsells...

733
00:37:31.122 --> 00:37:32.924
at the end of each month
will get a prize.


734
00:37:32.957 --> 00:37:35.358
This month,
the prize will be...


735
00:37:35.392 --> 00:37:37.628
drumroll, please.

736
00:37:45.102 --> 00:37:47.470
Yeah, thanks, Jeff.

737
00:37:47.504 --> 00:37:51.042
The winner will get

738
00:37:51.075 --> 00:37:54.444
What? Yes!

739
00:37:54.477 --> 00:37:56.113
- I have a question.
- What?


740
00:37:56.147 --> 00:37:58.381
Is that exchangeable?

741
00:37:58.415 --> 00:37:59.516
Exchangeable for what?

742
00:37:59.549 --> 00:38:01.018
- Well, real money.
- For cash.


743
00:38:01.052 --> 00:38:02.552
I don't go to Dave & Buster's.

744
00:38:02.587 --> 00:38:05.656
No, shut up.
Anyone else?


745
00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:07.692
- When's this meeting over?
- Pardon?


746
00:38:07.725 --> 00:38:09.093
Never mind.

747
00:38:09.126 --> 00:38:11.796
Do you even work here?

748
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:13.865
Ma'am, I'm sorry,
we open at 5 a.m.


749
00:38:13.898 --> 00:38:15.766
You have to stop doing this.

750
00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.168
It's not funny, Sage.

751
00:38:17.201 --> 00:38:18.535
Sorry.

752
00:38:18.568 --> 00:38:19.904
It's not funny.

753
00:38:19.937 --> 00:38:21.504
Can we lock the doors next time?

754
00:38:21.538 --> 00:38:24.041
- All right.
- Yeah, thanks.


755
00:38:39.489 --> 00:38:41.726
Oh, loser!

756
00:38:41.759 --> 00:38:43.995
Okay, I was going easy on you,

757
00:38:44.028 --> 00:38:45.562
but I'm done doing it.

758
00:38:50.768 --> 00:38:52.136
You scored on yourself!

759
00:38:52.169 --> 00:38:53.436
All right,
you see this?


760
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:54.839
- Yeah.
- So let's talk about...


761
00:38:54.872 --> 00:38:57.074
- Talk about what?
- ...the next...


762
00:38:58.709 --> 00:39:00.177
Ooh. This is a fast game.

763
00:39:07.251 --> 00:39:08.219
Come on, then.

764
00:39:10.755 --> 00:39:14.524
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

765
00:39:14.557 --> 00:39:15.927
Man, I can't wait
to see the face you make


766
00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.194
when you lose.

767
00:39:17.228 --> 00:39:18.863
Yeah, that's...
yeah, that's rich.


768
00:39:18.896 --> 00:39:21.065
You're a goddamned
fucking comedian.


769
00:39:21.098 --> 00:39:22.667
Thank you.

770
00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.135
No, no... wait, wait!

771
00:39:24.168 --> 00:39:25.670
Stakes.

772
00:39:25.703 --> 00:39:28.538
Ooh. Forgot about stakes.

773
00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:29.807
Name your price.

774
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.144
I win,
you get a Sailor Moon tattoo


775
00:39:33.177 --> 00:39:34.345
on your ass.

776
00:39:34.378 --> 00:39:38.849
Mm. Yeah, no, I was thinking
more in the realm of, like,


777
00:39:38.883 --> 00:39:40.051
mm, I buy you dinner.

778
00:39:40.084 --> 00:39:41.551
You already bought me dinner.

779
00:39:41.585 --> 00:39:43.988
Okay. Use it as
a frame of reference.


780
00:39:44.021 --> 00:39:46.824
Um...

781
00:39:46.857 --> 00:39:48.859
Oh, oh, oh, ha!

782
00:39:48.893 --> 00:39:50.194
I win,

783
00:39:50.227 --> 00:39:53.264
you shave off
both your eyebrows.


784
00:39:53.297 --> 00:39:55.066
No. But closer.

785
00:39:55.099 --> 00:39:56.200
Pussy?

786
00:39:56.233 --> 00:39:58.636
Sure. Yeah, you win,
I get your pussy.


787
00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:07.244
It was a joke, I don't want
any of your pussy.


788
00:40:07.278 --> 00:40:09.847
I am so sorry,
that was such a bad joke.


789
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.149
Ooh! I win,

790
00:40:12.183 --> 00:40:14.185
you paint your nails hot pink.

791
00:40:14.218 --> 00:40:16.153
I'm not really sure
how you made that leap,


792
00:40:16.187 --> 00:40:17.188
but done!

793
00:40:17.221 --> 00:40:18.656
- Toenails included.
- Fine.


794
00:40:18.689 --> 00:40:20.691
But, if I win...

795
00:40:20.725 --> 00:40:22.593
Unlikely.

796
00:40:22.626 --> 00:40:23.828
...you have to tell me
something about yourself


797
00:40:23.861 --> 00:40:26.529
that most people don't know.

798
00:40:26.563 --> 00:40:27.732
You're a closed book.

799
00:40:27.765 --> 00:40:29.700
Gotta get the story out
somehow.


800
00:40:29.734 --> 00:40:31.202
Although I don't know
why you'd be worried


801
00:40:31.235 --> 00:40:32.703
unless you think maybe
there's some chance


802
00:40:32.737 --> 00:40:35.072
you might lose?

803
00:40:35.106 --> 00:40:36.974
Funny,
you fucking bastard.


804
00:40:37.008 --> 00:40:37.942
You ready?

805
00:40:37.975 --> 00:40:38.843
Oh, I'm ready.

806
00:40:38.876 --> 00:40:41.779
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


807
00:40:43.714 --> 00:40:45.583
Almost.

808
00:40:45.616 --> 00:40:46.584
- Oh!
- Oh my God,


809
00:40:46.617 --> 00:40:47.718
you're so angry.

810
00:40:50.154 --> 00:40:51.122
Oh, God.

811
00:40:53.657 --> 00:40:56.827
- Yes!
- Nooo! No, no, no, no!


812
00:40:56.861 --> 00:41:00.264
- I told you I'd win.
- No! Oh, I can't breathe.


813
00:41:00.297 --> 00:41:01.165
Oh, that is rich.

814
00:41:01.198 --> 00:41:02.633
- Hold still.
- No, no.


815
00:41:02.666 --> 00:41:04.168
Okay, good. Hold still,
hold still, hold still.


816
00:41:04.201 --> 00:41:06.003
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

817
00:41:06.037 --> 00:41:07.805
- No, no!
- That's good, that's perfect.


818
00:41:07.838 --> 00:41:09.640
Oh, look, look!

819
00:41:09.673 --> 00:41:12.009
- Oh, the face of defeat...
- Help me!


820
00:41:12.043 --> 00:41:13.110
...is rich!

821
00:41:16.714 --> 00:41:19.583
It is like that homeless man
bent over and released


822
00:41:19.617 --> 00:41:22.353
an inhuman amount
of explosive diarrhea,


823
00:41:22.386 --> 00:41:24.789
and then decided to just do,
like,


824
00:41:24.822 --> 00:41:27.291
a 360 while he was at it.

825
00:41:27.324 --> 00:41:29.827
Wow. Is that what you say
to all the ladies?


826
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.062
Just you.

827
00:41:31.095 --> 00:41:32.096
Touched.

828
00:41:32.129 --> 00:41:34.265
Hey, do you think
the ceiling fan in the back


829
00:41:34.298 --> 00:41:36.067
is high enough for me
to hang a noose from?


830
00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.135
Come on,
don't sound so bleak.


831
00:41:38.169 --> 00:41:40.838
You've got those Dave & Buster's
bucks to look forward to,


832
00:41:40.871 --> 00:41:42.039
you can't forget that,

833
00:41:42.073 --> 00:41:43.641
it's important information.

834
00:41:43.674 --> 00:41:44.675
All right, I'm just
gonna come out and say it,


835
00:41:44.708 --> 00:41:46.210
'cause I know everyone else
is thinking it.


836
00:41:46.243 --> 00:41:47.978
You're gay?

837
00:41:48.012 --> 00:41:49.046
I wish.

838
00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.681
My romantic life would be
a lot less depressing


839
00:41:50.714 --> 00:41:51.849
if that was the case.

840
00:41:51.882 --> 00:41:53.918
Well, word on the street is
you've given a blow job,


841
00:41:53.951 --> 00:41:55.886
so I'm sure if you enjoyed that,

842
00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:58.289
you will be
pleasantly surprised by it.


843
00:41:58.322 --> 00:41:59.757
Okay, first of all,

844
00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:01.725
I was on the receiving end
of that blow job,


845
00:42:01.759 --> 00:42:03.360
and that was
a onetime experiment,


846
00:42:03.394 --> 00:42:04.962
it doesn't make me gay.

847
00:42:04.995 --> 00:42:06.397
It's not...

848
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:07.898
It definitely brings
your level of straight


849
00:42:07.932 --> 00:42:08.799
into question.

850
00:42:08.833 --> 00:42:09.733
Like you're so pure,

851
00:42:09.767 --> 00:42:12.903
Miss "It's easier
to go down on a girl


852
00:42:12.937 --> 00:42:15.106
than it is to suck a dick."

853
00:42:16.307 --> 00:42:18.876
Yeah. It is.
It absolutely is.


854
00:42:18.909 --> 00:42:20.644
And that was
a threesome situation,


855
00:42:20.678 --> 00:42:23.180
not one-on-one,
so totally different scenario.


856
00:42:23.214 --> 00:42:24.281
You know what?

857
00:42:24.315 --> 00:42:26.317
Those certificates are going
straight to Grace Kim,


858
00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:27.284
by the way.

859
00:42:27.318 --> 00:42:29.386
Who, by pure chance
being of Asian descent


860
00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:33.257
has the natural ability
to just beat all of us,


861
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:34.158
because she's Asian.

862
00:42:34.191 --> 00:42:35.960
Yeah, I don't think
the ceiling fan


863
00:42:35.993 --> 00:42:38.129
will sustain your weight,
but...


864
00:42:38.162 --> 00:42:40.264
you could try the exposed pipe
in the walk-in freezer.


865
00:42:40.297 --> 00:42:41.866
Just a thought.

866
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.435
I love my life.

867
00:42:44.468 --> 00:42:46.704
Well, it could be worse.

868
00:42:46.737 --> 00:42:48.372
You could be Laurel.

869
00:42:48.405 --> 00:42:50.074
I never thought about that.

870
00:42:50.107 --> 00:42:52.076
- That's really dark.
- That's super dark.


871
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:53.811
That's also funny!

872
00:42:53.844 --> 00:42:56.247
I'm telling you, you got
this dark humor thing down.


873
00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.715
You should really
capitalize on it,


874
00:42:57.748 --> 00:42:58.983
do some stand-up.

875
00:42:59.016 --> 00:43:01.152
In fact, there's this
really cool open mic


876
00:43:01.185 --> 00:43:03.020
- Thursday...
- No!


877
00:43:03.053 --> 00:43:03.854
What can I do?

878
00:43:03.888 --> 00:43:05.322
What can I do
to change your mind?


879
00:43:06.924 --> 00:43:09.093
Not suck dick, yeah.

880
00:43:09.126 --> 00:43:11.295
I told you,
I was on the receiving end.


881
00:43:11.328 --> 00:43:14.131
Oh my God, I forgot, yeah, and
also not get your dick sucked


882
00:43:14.165 --> 00:43:15.232
by other dudes.

883
00:43:15.266 --> 00:43:17.468
See? Now you're just
setting me up for failure.


884
00:43:17.501 --> 00:43:18.637
Why do you do that?

885
00:43:18.669 --> 00:43:20.905
Oh no, you are doing that
all on your own, I promise.


886
00:43:20.938 --> 00:43:23.874
So if I hadn't let Martin
have his way with me,


887
00:43:23.908 --> 00:43:25.142
then you'd let me date you?

888
00:43:25.176 --> 00:43:26.710
Honestly?

889
00:43:26.744 --> 00:43:28.345
I don't even care
that you like dudes, whatever.


890
00:43:28.379 --> 00:43:32.349
It's your... general existence
that repels me,


891
00:43:32.383 --> 00:43:34.018
it's just like, ugh.

892
00:43:34.051 --> 00:43:36.253
Wow. Okay, you know what?

893
00:43:36.287 --> 00:43:37.488
I don't even like you anymore.

894
00:43:37.521 --> 00:43:39.056
All right? There. I said it.

895
00:43:39.089 --> 00:43:40.257
I've been over you for a while.

896
00:43:40.291 --> 00:43:41.358
And you know what?

897
00:43:41.392 --> 00:43:44.295
Martin loves me
for who I am,


898
00:43:44.328 --> 00:43:47.798
so fuck you.

899
00:43:47.831 --> 00:43:49.133
Where are you going?

900
00:43:49.166 --> 00:43:52.937
I'm going to hang myself
from the freezer.


901
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.038
Unless you'd miss me.

902
00:43:54.071 --> 00:43:56.240
Oh no, you go ahead,
you have fun.


903
00:43:56.273 --> 00:43:58.175
Bye!

904
00:43:59.009 --> 00:44:01.412
Okay.

905
00:44:01.445 --> 00:44:05.082
Have I got something
special for you.


906
00:44:07.318 --> 00:44:09.086
So what is it?

907
00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:11.822
Some red wine.

908
00:44:11.855 --> 00:44:13.490
- Tell me. Tell me.
- It's a good cab,


909
00:44:13.524 --> 00:44:16.126
cab sauvignon, somethin'.

910
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.095
It's Trader Joe's house wine.

911
00:44:18.128 --> 00:44:19.763
That's, like, six bucks.

912
00:44:19.797 --> 00:44:22.066
Four. Got it on clearance.

913
00:44:22.099 --> 00:44:23.167
Well, then,
I hope it has mold


914
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:25.469
and you go into
anaphylactic shock.


915
00:44:25.502 --> 00:44:28.906
That could very potentially lead
to both of our deaths.


916
00:44:28.939 --> 00:44:30.841
I welcome death.

917
00:44:30.874 --> 00:44:33.377
Hm. Cheers.

918
00:44:34.478 --> 00:44:35.379
To our mass suicide.

919
00:44:35.412 --> 00:44:36.981
Okay.

920
00:44:40.585 --> 00:44:42.553
Oh, it's terrible!

921
00:44:42.587 --> 00:44:45.189
I am so sorry.

922
00:44:45.222 --> 00:44:46.323
That's all right.

923
00:44:46.357 --> 00:44:47.825
I don't think so,
I think it's the worst thing


924
00:44:47.858 --> 00:44:50.160
that's ever been
inside my mouth.


925
00:44:50.194 --> 00:44:52.896
There's been some weird shit
in my mouth.


926
00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:54.331
But that is bad.

927
00:44:54.365 --> 00:44:56.867
Uggh!

928
00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.469
Okay.

929
00:44:58.502 --> 00:44:59.903
You ready?

930
00:44:59.937 --> 00:45:01.805
For what?

931
00:45:05.042 --> 00:45:05.976
What?

932
00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:07.044
- Talk.
- No.


933
00:45:07.077 --> 00:45:08.112
- Yeah.
- No, we really don't


934
00:45:08.145 --> 00:45:09.046
have to do this.

935
00:45:09.079 --> 00:45:09.947
Oh, we really do,
because if I had lost,


936
00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:11.849
you'da made me
paint my fingernails,


937
00:45:11.882 --> 00:45:13.884
so you're...
you're gonna talk.


938
00:45:13.917 --> 00:45:14.785
But whatever
I'm gonna come up with


939
00:45:14.818 --> 00:45:17.421
is gonna be lame
and depressing so, no.


940
00:45:17.454 --> 00:45:18.555
I love lame and depressing,

941
00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:20.024
that's why I asked you out.

942
00:45:20.057 --> 00:45:21.425
Fuck you.

943
00:45:21.458 --> 00:45:23.827
Fine. Okay.

944
00:45:23.861 --> 00:45:28.832
I haven't talked
with my parents in 10 years.


945
00:45:31.335 --> 00:45:33.971
- Okay.
- That's it.


946
00:45:34.004 --> 00:45:36.407
You have any cheese
that can go with this?


947
00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.609
You're not gonna
get away with that.


948
00:45:37.642 --> 00:45:39.410
If I drink
on an empty stomach,


949
00:45:39.443 --> 00:45:41.545
things tend to get
a little slutty.


950
00:45:41.579 --> 00:45:42.446
And I like you,

951
00:45:42.479 --> 00:45:46.417
so I wanna just
stay a little classy.


952
00:45:48.519 --> 00:45:50.921
You said you like me!

953
00:45:50.954 --> 00:45:52.556
Oh.

954
00:45:54.291 --> 00:45:55.993
- Did you like that?
- Don't ever do that ever again.


955
00:45:56.026 --> 00:45:57.461
- No?
- Could you maybe, like,


956
00:45:57.494 --> 00:45:59.063
talk a little low, maybe that?

957
00:45:59.096 --> 00:46:01.165
- Like Vin Diesel?
- Yes.


958
00:46:01.198 --> 00:46:02.499
Family.

959
00:46:03.534 --> 00:46:06.270
I can't really
lower my voice that much, but...


960
00:46:06.303 --> 00:46:08.939
- family.
- Oh!


961
00:46:08.972 --> 00:46:10.541
- Fantastic.
- Fine!


962
00:46:10.575 --> 00:46:11.975
- What?
- If I get you cheese,


963
00:46:12.009 --> 00:46:13.410
will you please finish?

964
00:46:13.444 --> 00:46:15.512
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
get the cheese!


965
00:46:15.546 --> 00:46:17.047
Yes!

966
00:46:23.354 --> 00:46:25.923
Uggh!

967
00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.129
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

968
00:46:32.162 --> 00:46:35.499
Okay. Cheese, knife, crackers.

969
00:46:35.532 --> 00:46:38.135
- Are you serious?
- I'm very serious.


970
00:46:38.168 --> 00:46:39.870
Blue cheese?

971
00:46:41.438 --> 00:46:43.340
What else do you want from me?

972
00:46:43.374 --> 00:46:48.078
Who hurt you as a child
that you put out blue cheese?


973
00:46:54.151 --> 00:46:56.654
- I like you.
- Aww!


974
00:46:56.688 --> 00:46:58.055
A little bit.

975
00:47:00.725 --> 00:47:02.627
No matter what you tell me,

976
00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:05.429
that's not gonna change.

977
00:47:05.462 --> 00:47:07.264
I promise.

978
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.045
Okay.

979
00:47:25.182 --> 00:47:28.318
Um...

980
00:47:28.352 --> 00:47:30.722
My dad,

981
00:47:30.755 --> 00:47:32.222
he used to drink.

982
00:47:32.256 --> 00:47:33.625
And one night,

983
00:47:33.658 --> 00:47:35.693
we were watching TV
in the living room,


984
00:47:35.727 --> 00:47:41.098
my mom had fallen asleep putting
my little brother to bed.


985
00:47:41.131 --> 00:47:43.200
My head was in my dad's lap.

986
00:47:43.233 --> 00:47:45.569
He was stroking my hair.

987
00:47:45.603 --> 00:47:50.675
And, um, then I felt
this hand go up my shirt.


988
00:47:52.509 --> 00:47:56.313
First, I didn't know
what to do,


989
00:47:56.346 --> 00:47:59.082
but eventually,
I snapped up,


990
00:47:59.116 --> 00:48:00.752
walked back to my room,

991
00:48:00.785 --> 00:48:06.190
and I slept with the desk chair
pushed against the doorknob.


992
00:48:08.292 --> 00:48:09.259
And the next day,

993
00:48:09.293 --> 00:48:13.197
he pretended like
nothing had ever happened.


994
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:15.499
So at first I thought
maybe he didn't remember


995
00:48:15.532 --> 00:48:20.772
or maybe I was
remembering it wrong, but...


996
00:48:20.805 --> 00:48:24.541
every time we would be alone
in a room together,


997
00:48:24.576 --> 00:48:27.444
he would look at me
like he remembered.


998
00:48:27.478 --> 00:48:31.181
Sure enough, another night,
I woke up, and...


999
00:48:37.722 --> 00:48:40.557
Well, anyways,

1000
00:48:40.592 --> 00:48:44.528
I ended up telling my mom
couple months later.


1001
00:48:44.561 --> 00:48:47.498
She freaked out,

1002
00:48:47.531 --> 00:48:48.766
and my dad said
that he was hurt


1003
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.000
that I would say
something like that,


1004
00:48:50.033 --> 00:48:53.337
that he would never hurt me
in a million years, that I...


1005
00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:56.674
that I was his little girl.

1006
00:49:00.177 --> 00:49:03.213
But my mom threw me
out of the house,


1007
00:49:03.247 --> 00:49:08.352
and I haven't seen either them
or my little brother since.


1008
00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:17.494
I'm so sorry.

1009
00:49:17.528 --> 00:49:20.632
It happens.

1010
00:49:20.665 --> 00:49:24.736
And now, end Chapter One,
right?


1011
00:49:24.769 --> 00:49:26.838
I really hope that I didn't
make you talk about something


1012
00:49:26.871 --> 00:49:28.806
that you didn't want
to talk about, I...


1013
00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:32.242
I kinda feel like
a total asshole right now.


1014
00:49:32.276 --> 00:49:34.712
That's because
you are an asshole.


1015
00:49:38.215 --> 00:49:42.452
I hope I didn't
scare you off too much.


1016
00:49:42.486 --> 00:49:43.688
No, no...

1017
00:49:43.721 --> 00:49:45.188
No, I'm just kidding.

1018
00:49:46.791 --> 00:49:49.493
Not at all.

1019
00:49:52.362 --> 00:49:54.766
What? No. Ugh!

1020
00:49:54.799 --> 00:49:56.433
Okay, fine.

1021
00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:23.928
I can make you something.

1022
00:50:23.962 --> 00:50:25.730
- You want eggs?
- No, I don't have time for that,


1023
00:50:25.763 --> 00:50:26.764
I'm already late.

1024
00:50:26.798 --> 00:50:27.699
I can make it real quick!

1025
00:50:27.732 --> 00:50:28.666
No!

1026
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:30.868
- They're eggs!
- No!


1027
00:50:30.902 --> 00:50:32.169
All right, well, just
grab something from the kitchen


1028
00:50:32.202 --> 00:50:33.170
before you go.

1029
00:50:33.203 --> 00:50:34.571
- I already did.
- Oh! Sneaky little shithead.


1030
00:50:34.606 --> 00:50:36.774
- I know.
- Mm.


1031
00:50:38.810 --> 00:50:39.711
Gonna miss you.

1032
00:50:39.744 --> 00:50:41.378
Gonna miss you too.

1033
00:50:41.411 --> 00:50:43.246
- Bye.
- Bye.


1034
00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.448
Mm, so minty fresh!

1035
00:50:44.481 --> 00:50:46.350
You're minty fresh.

1036
00:50:46.383 --> 00:50:48.218
Where you going?

1037
00:50:48.251 --> 00:50:49.721
Dude.

1038
00:50:49.754 --> 00:50:52.890
Are you even reading
or just staring?


1039
00:50:52.924 --> 00:50:55.192
- I'm staring.
- I know.


1040
00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:58.362
Did she notice?

1041
00:50:58.395 --> 00:50:59.296
- Yeah.
- Yep.


1042
00:50:59.329 --> 00:51:00.598
Shit.

1043
00:51:00.632 --> 00:51:03.500
Okay, um...
was she pissed?


1044
00:51:03.533 --> 00:51:04.669
I mean, it's hard to tell.

1045
00:51:04.702 --> 00:51:05.903
She asked where you were.

1046
00:51:05.937 --> 00:51:09.306
Fuck!

1047
00:51:09.339 --> 00:51:10.675
Leeds?

1048
00:51:11.676 --> 00:51:14.344
My office.

1049
00:51:16.814 --> 00:51:18.850
She's... she's in a good mood.

1050
00:51:18.883 --> 00:51:20.718
- Hmph.
- No she's not.


1051
00:51:20.752 --> 00:51:22.319
Shut up!

1052
00:51:28.258 --> 00:51:30.662
Do you enjoy
working for this company?


1053
00:51:30.695 --> 00:51:32.362
Absolutely, ma'am.

1054
00:51:32.396 --> 00:51:35.532
We want a team of people
who take a serious interest


1055
00:51:35.565 --> 00:51:38.636
in building a future
at this company.


1056
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:39.804
Okay.

1057
00:51:39.837 --> 00:51:41.204
We have an opening
in Adult Fiction.


1058
00:51:41.238 --> 00:51:42.472
It's not a huge
starting salary,


1059
00:51:42.506 --> 00:51:44.609
but a definite pay jump
from zero,


1060
00:51:44.642 --> 00:51:48.545
plus benefits
and room to advance.


1061
00:51:48.579 --> 00:51:51.783
We can draft up a contract
starting Monday.


1062
00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:55.720
I can take that as a yes?

1063
00:51:55.753 --> 00:51:57.554
I'm so proud of you,

1064
00:51:57.588 --> 00:52:00.858
you beautiful,
beautiful creature!


1065
00:52:00.892 --> 00:52:02.827
Oh, here we go, okay.

1066
00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:04.227
Hey, you ready,
or should I give you a moment?


1067
00:52:04.261 --> 00:52:05.395
Another round of Bellinis,
please,


1068
00:52:05.429 --> 00:52:06.898
and make them real strong.

1069
00:52:06.931 --> 00:52:08.565
Or something
less embarrassing.


1070
00:52:08.599 --> 00:52:09.600
We're celebrating,

1071
00:52:09.634 --> 00:52:11.401
so we need it to be fancy!

1072
00:52:11.435 --> 00:52:14.706
And add in some mortification
to balance out the good news.


1073
00:52:14.739 --> 00:52:16.607
With Bellinis.

1074
00:52:16.641 --> 00:52:19.509
- Apparently.
- She just got a promotion.


1075
00:52:19.543 --> 00:52:22.512
- Congratulations!
- Thank you...


1076
00:52:22.546 --> 00:52:23.748
Adrian.

1077
00:52:23.781 --> 00:52:24.782
...Adrian.

1078
00:52:24.816 --> 00:52:26.416
Can I also get
a shot of tequila,


1079
00:52:26.450 --> 00:52:27.484
something redemptive?

1080
00:52:27.517 --> 00:52:29.787
Can you make that
two shots of tequila, please?


1081
00:52:29.821 --> 00:52:30.955
Sure.

1082
00:52:32.355 --> 00:52:33.323
Really?

1083
00:52:33.356 --> 00:52:34.759
I'm out just having fun.

1084
00:52:34.792 --> 00:52:35.893
Really?

1085
00:52:35.927 --> 00:52:38.295
You know what, I'll get in
on that shot, please.


1086
00:52:38.328 --> 00:52:39.731
Yes!

1087
00:52:39.764 --> 00:52:42.566
I'm warding off depression,
it's a serious thing.


1088
00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.836
All right, tequila preference?

1089
00:52:44.869 --> 00:52:45.770
Well.

1090
00:52:45.803 --> 00:52:48.773
Wow, must've been
some kind of promotion.


1091
00:52:48.806 --> 00:52:52.309
Unpaid to paid,
so in some respects, yes.


1092
00:52:52.342 --> 00:52:57.014
I haven't quite made the jump
from well brand.


1093
00:52:57.048 --> 00:53:00.818
Casamigos, on me.

1094
00:53:00.852 --> 00:53:01.819
Thank you.

1095
00:53:03.988 --> 00:53:06.758
- Casamigos is the best.
- Yes.


1096
00:53:06.791 --> 00:53:07.992
Enjoy.

1097
00:53:09.861 --> 00:53:10.995
Oh, very nice.

1098
00:53:11.028 --> 00:53:12.930
Is your vagina
always this magnetic?


1099
00:53:12.964 --> 00:53:16.299
Dude, he is really hot,
just saying.


1100
00:53:22.673 --> 00:53:26.577
Oh, God, I admire someone
who can chug a Bellini.


1101
00:53:26.611 --> 00:53:27.845
Seriously, I'm just having...

1102
00:53:27.879 --> 00:53:28.980
Having fun, we heard.

1103
00:53:29.013 --> 00:53:31.082
I personally am a fan
of drunk Casey.


1104
00:53:31.115 --> 00:53:32.083
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


1105
00:53:32.116 --> 00:53:34.484
Oh, good, then you can be
the one she gropes


1106
00:53:34.518 --> 00:53:35.586
when she passes her limit.

1107
00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.789
Okay, that was one time.

1108
00:53:37.822 --> 00:53:40.925
- It was more than once.
- It was more than once.


1109
00:53:40.958 --> 00:53:43.094
I'm just having fun tonight.

1110
00:53:43.127 --> 00:53:45.630
Oh, you said that.

1111
00:53:45.663 --> 00:53:47.899
Let's go have some fun!

1112
00:53:54.437 --> 00:53:55.807
Hyperbole.

1113
00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:01.478
Why is that so funny?

1114
00:54:01.511 --> 00:54:02.814
I have no idea.

1115
00:54:02.847 --> 00:54:04.347
I'm getting dropped off.

1116
00:54:04.381 --> 00:54:05.549
No!

1117
00:54:05.583 --> 00:54:07.852
No, you cannot leave.

1118
00:54:07.885 --> 00:54:08.920
We are a tribe.

1119
00:54:08.953 --> 00:54:10.520
Yeah, Sage, we're a tribe.

1120
00:54:10.554 --> 00:54:12.489
Uh-huh, lesbian tribe.

1121
00:54:12.522 --> 00:54:13.390
Okay.

1122
00:54:13.423 --> 00:54:16.459
You can't leave,
that is child abuse.


1123
00:54:16.493 --> 00:54:20.598
Sir, tell her she cannot leave
because that is child abuse.


1124
00:54:24.501 --> 00:54:27.104
Okay, I think only dolphins
could hear that.


1125
00:54:29.941 --> 00:54:31.709
Look at these breasts!

1126
00:54:31.742 --> 00:54:35.445
They're so perfect and shiny

1127
00:54:35.478 --> 00:54:38.115
and soft.

1128
00:54:38.149 --> 00:54:40.618
You could have one to two
nipples in your mouth


1129
00:54:40.651 --> 00:54:44.421
at any given moment,
and, oh, it would just be...


1130
00:54:44.454 --> 00:54:45.723
heaven, wouldn't it?

1131
00:54:45.756 --> 00:54:47.592
Okay, you don't need
to answer that.


1132
00:54:47.625 --> 00:54:49.026
- Thank you.
- He's gonna answer.


1133
00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.127
Let the man be heard.

1134
00:54:50.161 --> 00:54:52.096
Would it be heaven or would...

1135
00:54:52.129 --> 00:54:54.632
Sir, I have a question for you.

1136
00:54:54.665 --> 00:54:57.168
Yeah?

1137
00:54:57.201 --> 00:55:00.071
What kind of jizz do you have?
Does it taste like rubber?


1138
00:55:00.104 --> 00:55:02.139
- Okay!
- What?


1139
00:55:02.173 --> 00:55:05.610
It's human nature.
Stop being embarrassing.


1140
00:55:05.643 --> 00:55:06.476
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1141
00:55:06.509 --> 00:55:08.679
You know what else is natural?
Yeah?


1142
00:55:08.713 --> 00:55:11.182
Melatonin and hot tea, okay?

1143
00:55:11.215 --> 00:55:13.117
Let's get you some of that.

1144
00:55:13.150 --> 00:55:15.019
- Yeah?
- I think I'm gonna puke.


1145
00:55:15.052 --> 00:55:17.922
No, no, there's no puking
in the car, okay?


1146
00:55:17.955 --> 00:55:19.156
Can you hear that, Casey?

1147
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:22.193
If you puke,
you have to swallow it.


1148
00:55:22.226 --> 00:55:23.861
You gotta swallow it, okay?

1149
00:55:23.895 --> 00:55:26.898
- Okay.
- It's okay, baby, it's okay.


1150
00:55:26.931 --> 00:55:28.733
We'll get you home.

1151
00:55:28.766 --> 00:55:30.533
We'll catch it right in here.

1152
00:55:31.903 --> 00:55:33.070
Let's go somewhere else.

1153
00:55:33.104 --> 00:55:34.705
No, go back to sleep.

1154
00:55:34.739 --> 00:55:36.207
Go back to sleep, please.

1155
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.175
Please put her back to sleep.

1156
00:55:38.209 --> 00:55:41.178
My nipple 'bout to pop out.

1157
00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:01.198
Hello?

1158
00:56:01.232 --> 00:56:03.000
What are you wearing?

1159
00:56:03.034 --> 00:56:04.467
You just get home?

1160
00:56:04.501 --> 00:56:05.803
Mm-hmm.

1161
00:56:05.836 --> 00:56:07.570
- You have fun?
- Mm-hmm.


1162
00:56:07.605 --> 00:56:08.673
Did you have fun?

1163
00:56:08.706 --> 00:56:12.176
Mmm, went to bed at 10 p.m.,
so, yeah, had a blast.


1164
00:56:12.209 --> 00:56:13.844
Well, you should come over
to my bed


1165
00:56:13.878 --> 00:56:16.080
and blast something in my face.

1166
00:56:16.113 --> 00:56:17.815
Look, as much fun
as that sounds,


1167
00:56:17.848 --> 00:56:18.983
I can't tonight.

1168
00:56:19.016 --> 00:56:20.685
What, why?

1169
00:56:20.718 --> 00:56:21.919
Because it's 3 a.m.

1170
00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:24.722
So?

1171
00:56:24.755 --> 00:56:27.490
So, I have to wake up early.

1172
00:56:28.726 --> 00:56:30.127
Please?

1173
00:56:30.161 --> 00:56:33.064
I really can't.

1174
00:56:33.097 --> 00:56:35.498
I'll swallow!

1175
00:56:35.532 --> 00:56:37.567
Call you tomorrow, okay?

1176
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:28.085
It's just a mock-up,
it's not the final thing.


1177
00:57:28.119 --> 00:57:31.088
Oh, okay, cool.

1178
00:57:31.122 --> 00:57:32.823
Yeah, I was looking
for a nice way


1179
00:57:32.857 --> 00:57:35.926
to tell you how shitty it is.

1180
00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:37.928
I'm kidding!

1181
00:57:37.962 --> 00:57:40.097
Okay, well, what do you think?

1182
00:57:40.131 --> 00:57:42.967
I think I should've
trademarked that.


1183
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.636
Does this mean that
I actually inspired you?


1184
00:57:45.669 --> 00:57:46.737
Don't get cocky.

1185
00:57:46.771 --> 00:57:48.739
Ooh, don't say "cock" around me,
that turns me on.


1186
00:57:48.773 --> 00:57:50.341
Okay, bye-bye, you're done.

1187
00:57:50.374 --> 00:57:52.610
- That was a compliment.
- Don't touch that.


1188
00:57:52.643 --> 00:57:54.678
Okay, I won't.

1189
00:58:03.287 --> 00:58:04.889
Whoa.

1190
00:58:04.922 --> 00:58:06.690
I'm not asking you
if it's boring.


1191
00:58:06.724 --> 00:58:08.993
I'm telling you that you said
that looked fair,


1192
00:58:09.026 --> 00:58:10.227
but it was very foul.

1193
00:58:10.261 --> 00:58:12.830
Oh my God, you are so creepy!

1194
00:58:12.863 --> 00:58:13.964
- Hi.
- Hi.


1195
00:58:13.998 --> 00:58:16.801
Um, Skylar, this is Morgan;
Morgan, this is Skylar.


1196
00:58:16.834 --> 00:58:18.636
- Oh my God, Morgan.
- Hi.


1197
00:58:18.669 --> 00:58:20.604
- Stoked to finally meet you!
- Really?


1198
00:58:20.638 --> 00:58:22.139
Oh my gosh! Yes!

1199
00:58:22.173 --> 00:58:24.375
Oh, uh, I'm gonna get a drink.

1200
00:58:24.408 --> 00:58:25.876
Okay. You can stay.

1201
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:27.344
I'm just gonna get a drink,
like real...


1202
00:58:27.378 --> 00:58:29.280
- You can go get a drink.
- I'm gonna be like right back.


1203
00:58:29.313 --> 00:58:30.381
- You can stay.
- I promise.


1204
00:58:30.414 --> 00:58:32.650
- You can get a drink.
- It's so good to meet you.


1205
00:58:35.786 --> 00:58:38.055
Are you fucking kidding me?

1206
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:39.056
I hate...

1207
00:58:41.025 --> 00:58:42.827
- Don't flick me.
- Don't flick me!


1208
00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:44.929
Hey, be nice, be nice,
or no more fries!


1209
00:58:44.962 --> 00:58:46.630
I'll be nice.

1210
00:58:46.664 --> 00:58:48.232
- Okay.
- Yeah.


1211
00:58:48.265 --> 00:58:49.500
- Have some more fries.
- Thank you.


1212
00:58:49.533 --> 00:58:52.203
We'll head out of here
as soon as this inning's over.


1213
00:58:52.236 --> 00:58:54.905
Oh, I love it
when you talk frat to me.


1214
00:58:54.939 --> 00:58:57.141
Come here, come here.

1215
00:58:58.008 --> 00:59:00.144
By God, you're still
minty fresh!


1216
00:59:00.177 --> 00:59:02.146
My gum's still minty fresh!

1217
00:59:02.179 --> 00:59:04.215
You have a little Buffalo sauce
on your face.


1218
00:59:04.248 --> 00:59:06.383
- I was saving it for you.
- Yeah?


1219
00:59:06.417 --> 00:59:07.852
You're the sweetest.

1220
00:59:07.885 --> 00:59:09.353
- You have no idea.
- No?


1221
00:59:09.386 --> 00:59:11.956
Reach into my pocket.

1222
00:59:11.989 --> 00:59:13.290
Okay.

1223
00:59:13.324 --> 00:59:14.425
- There you go.
- Yeah?


1224
00:59:14.458 --> 00:59:15.693
- Lower.
- Okay.


1225
00:59:15.726 --> 00:59:16.994
- Grab it.
- Okay.


1226
00:59:17.027 --> 00:59:18.062
Get it!

1227
00:59:18.095 --> 00:59:19.363
That's it!

1228
00:59:19.396 --> 00:59:20.798
- You didn't.
- I did.


1229
00:59:20.831 --> 00:59:22.666
No!

1230
00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:23.934
Tums!

1231
00:59:23.968 --> 00:59:26.770
For later,
'cause you burp so much.


1232
00:59:26.804 --> 00:59:28.439
Fuck you, but thank you!

1233
00:59:28.472 --> 00:59:31.709
Hey, Jared, Morgan;
Morgan, Jared.


1234
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:36.080
Hi... Morgan.

1235
00:59:36.113 --> 00:59:37.681
Good to finally meet you.

1236
00:59:37.715 --> 00:59:38.782
Same.

1237
00:59:43.721 --> 00:59:47.992
So, remind me, how long
have you two been together?


1238
00:59:49.093 --> 00:59:51.328
Since February.

1239
00:59:51.362 --> 00:59:53.330
Wow, that...

1240
00:59:53.364 --> 00:59:55.733
that's a long time.

1241
00:59:55.766 --> 00:59:58.269
Jared and I go way back.

1242
00:59:58.302 --> 01:00:00.337
All the way to middle school.

1243
01:00:00.371 --> 01:00:02.106
- No way.
- Way.


1244
01:00:02.139 --> 01:00:03.974
Yeah, surprising we still talk,
actually,


1245
01:00:04.008 --> 01:00:05.843
considering how much
we hated each other.


1246
01:00:07.144 --> 01:00:08.946
That's very funny.

1247
01:00:08.979 --> 01:00:11.882
- Hilarious.
- Yeah, he, uh...


1248
01:00:11.916 --> 01:00:13.284
Well, I'll say this
to your face


1249
01:00:13.317 --> 01:00:14.919
'cause you're sitting
right in front of me.


1250
01:00:14.952 --> 01:00:16.387
You were a total dickhole.

1251
01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:17.688
Oh, not in front of the lady.

1252
01:00:17.721 --> 01:00:20.291
He was, he knows that though,
I've told him a million times.


1253
01:00:20.324 --> 01:00:22.760
- Different now.
- He's a changed man.


1254
01:00:23.827 --> 01:00:25.996
Just depends on the day.

1255
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:28.799
And yet, here we are,

1256
01:00:28.832 --> 01:00:31.068
all these years later.

1257
01:00:31.101 --> 01:00:31.936
Go!

1258
01:00:31.969 --> 01:00:33.370
- Oh!
- Jesus.


1259
01:00:33.404 --> 01:00:36.073
It's out! It's out!

1260
01:00:36.106 --> 01:00:37.174
This is fun.

1261
01:00:42.413 --> 01:00:43.380
What?

1262
01:00:43.414 --> 01:00:46.150
Are you mad at me?

1263
01:00:46.183 --> 01:00:48.452
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't come over, okay?


1264
01:00:48.485 --> 01:00:50.487
I was half asleep
when you called.


1265
01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:52.256
Okay.

1266
01:00:52.289 --> 01:00:54.124
Let me take you out
to dinner tonight.


1267
01:00:54.158 --> 01:00:56.527
Stop bribing me with food.

1268
01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:58.128
Please.

1269
01:00:58.162 --> 01:00:59.330
Even if I wanted to,

1270
01:00:59.363 --> 01:01:01.832
my head feels like
it's peeling in half.


1271
01:01:01.865 --> 01:01:05.069
So, there's not much movement
going on right now.


1272
01:01:05.102 --> 01:01:07.871
I'll take it.
I'll call you around 6.


1273
01:01:07.905 --> 01:01:11.875
I'll bring you whatever
you want, just text me.


1274
01:01:11.909 --> 01:01:13.844
I love you.

1275
01:01:16.347 --> 01:01:17.548
Shit.

1276
01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.087
Hello?

1277
01:01:57.121 --> 01:01:59.323
Sage, hey, it's Aubrey!

1278
01:01:59.356 --> 01:02:01.825
Um, can you work tonight?

1279
01:02:01.859 --> 01:02:02.926
Uh...

1280
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.428
I can't tonight.

1281
01:02:04.461 --> 01:02:05.597
Please, Sage.

1282
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:08.499
If I get one more write-up,
Laurel is gonna fire me,


1283
01:02:08.532 --> 01:02:10.067
and I can't lose this job.

1284
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.969
I just enrolled in acting class,

1285
01:02:12.002 --> 01:02:13.904
and my agent says
I need to do a self-tape,


1286
01:02:13.937 --> 01:02:14.905
and then
my acting teacher's like,


1287
01:02:14.938 --> 01:02:16.507
"Hey, you should probably take
a yoga class,"


1288
01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:18.309
you know, just like,
to loosen up and stuff


1289
01:02:18.342 --> 01:02:20.511
because I'm just really tense
all the fucking time.


1290
01:02:20.544 --> 01:02:22.012
So, how am I gonna afford
a yoga class...


1291
01:02:22.046 --> 01:02:23.314
Did you ask Grace Kim already?

1292
01:02:23.347 --> 01:02:25.082
She quit.

1293
01:02:25.115 --> 01:02:26.116
What, when?

1294
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.950
Like a month ago.

1295
01:02:26.984 --> 01:02:28.886
She got into med school
or something,


1296
01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:30.988
which is great,
you know, whatever,


1297
01:02:31.021 --> 01:02:33.157
but I have this huge audition,

1298
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:35.359
and now I'm totally fucked.

1299
01:02:35.392 --> 01:02:37.461
I'm supposed to be playing
this meth addict


1300
01:02:37.494 --> 01:02:39.631
who finds herself
through violin.


1301
01:02:39.664 --> 01:02:42.433
It's really hard to explain,
but it's a comedy pilot,


1302
01:02:42.466 --> 01:02:44.636
and I just, like,
really need time


1303
01:02:44.669 --> 01:02:50.107
to, like, focus on my craft,
you know?


1304
01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.576
Please, Sage.

1305
01:02:51.609 --> 01:02:53.210
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.


1306
01:02:53.243 --> 01:02:55.913
Yeah, okay, all right,
fine, yes, I will do it.


1307
01:02:55.946 --> 01:02:58.182
Oh my God, thank you so much!

1308
01:02:58.215 --> 01:02:59.883
You're the fucking best,
I owe you.


1309
01:02:59.917 --> 01:03:01.952
Okay, gotta go, bye.

1310
01:03:01.985 --> 01:03:03.087
We're good, let's do it.

1311
01:03:04.689 --> 01:03:07.224
I done had a long-ass morning.

1312
01:03:07.257 --> 01:03:10.060
The fuck you mean
you can't take my coupon?


1313
01:03:10.094 --> 01:03:13.030
- It's expired.
- By one day.


1314
01:03:13.063 --> 01:03:15.232
Yeah, which makes it expired.

1315
01:03:15.265 --> 01:03:17.067
See, this is some bullshit.

1316
01:03:17.101 --> 01:03:19.436
Okay, I physically can't take
your coupon


1317
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:22.172
because the button for it
doesn't exist anymore.


1318
01:03:27.111 --> 01:03:29.213
It's 'cause I'm Black, ain't it?

1319
01:03:30.715 --> 01:03:32.549
Man, fuck this whole
racist-ass shit,


1320
01:03:32.584 --> 01:03:34.451
that little fake-ass smile
you do.


1321
01:03:37.054 --> 01:03:39.323
Fucking white mints.
Fuck your white mints.


1322
01:03:39.356 --> 01:03:41.358
What the hell you lookin' at?
What you holdin'?


1323
01:03:41.392 --> 01:03:42.694
Man, you got shit in your hand.

1324
01:03:42.727 --> 01:03:44.228
Turn around, motherfucker!

1325
01:03:44.261 --> 01:03:45.630
Go back there
and make some coffee.


1326
01:03:45.663 --> 01:03:48.198
Look at me!
Now go make some fucking coffee!


1327
01:03:48.232 --> 01:03:51.135
Y'all motherfuckers just lost
yourselves a valuable customer.


1328
01:03:54.238 --> 01:03:55.439
Great, thanks!

1329
01:03:55.472 --> 01:03:57.441
Thank you so much!

1330
01:04:01.979 --> 01:04:03.447
Sage.

1331
01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:10.120
Now.

1332
01:04:11.355 --> 01:04:13.524
I have my phone
and my wallet,


1333
01:04:13.557 --> 01:04:17.060
but I cannot find my jacket.

1334
01:04:17.094 --> 01:04:19.697
I don't know, I don't know
where your jacket is.


1335
01:04:25.169 --> 01:04:26.370
Duty calls.

1336
01:04:26.403 --> 01:04:28.238
Come here.

1337
01:04:32.242 --> 01:04:33.977
Thank you.

1338
01:04:34.011 --> 01:04:35.479
For what?

1339
01:04:35.512 --> 01:04:37.181
For everything.

1340
01:04:37.214 --> 01:04:41.653
For making me feel wanted
and important.


1341
01:04:41.686 --> 01:04:43.153
Just being nice.

1342
01:04:43.187 --> 01:04:44.555
What's going on?

1343
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:46.089
Okay.

1344
01:04:46.123 --> 01:04:47.324
I'm just...

1345
01:04:47.357 --> 01:04:51.729
very much in like with you.

1346
01:04:51.763 --> 01:04:53.397
Like love.

1347
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:57.267
I'm in like-love with you.

1348
01:04:57.301 --> 01:05:00.337
I've never told anyone that
before,


1349
01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:03.173
and I just thought
you should know that.


1350
01:05:09.513 --> 01:05:12.349
I really like-love you too.

1351
01:05:12.382 --> 01:05:14.551
You don't have to say that.

1352
01:05:14.586 --> 01:05:16.220
I don't care if you do or don't.

1353
01:05:16.253 --> 01:05:18.522
Yet despite your indifference
to my feelings,


1354
01:05:18.555 --> 01:05:20.692
um, I really do.

1355
01:05:22.192 --> 01:05:25.229
Even if you are
a ginormous nerd.


1356
01:05:26.263 --> 01:05:27.464
How dare you?

1357
01:05:27.498 --> 01:05:28.733
You know that I don't
just, like, watch


1358
01:05:28.766 --> 01:05:30.467
that much Harry Potter
for anyone, right?


1359
01:05:30.501 --> 01:05:31.669
You like those movies.

1360
01:05:31.703 --> 01:05:35.072
No, I like those movies because
I have to like those movies.


1361
01:05:35.105 --> 01:05:38.242
Whatever, I watched
The Bachelor for you.


1362
01:05:38.275 --> 01:05:40.812
You promise me that is not
something we will speak of.


1363
01:05:42.412 --> 01:05:44.749
- Promise.
- You won't tell.


1364
01:05:44.782 --> 01:05:46.618
All right, bye.

1365
01:05:46.651 --> 01:05:48.118
Bye.

1366
01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:11.843
Okay, bye for real.

1367
01:06:31.663 --> 01:06:33.798
Hey, um,

1368
01:06:33.831 --> 01:06:36.567
it's almost 9 p.m.

1369
01:06:36.601 --> 01:06:39.804
I'm guessing you're not coming
over with dinner anymore.


1370
01:06:42.172 --> 01:06:44.709
Look, I'm not even mad, I just
want to make sure you're okay,


1371
01:06:44.742 --> 01:06:47.210
so... call me back.

1372
01:06:49.614 --> 01:06:51.114
Bye.

1373
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:08.432
Hey, congratulations
on your first write-up.


1374
01:07:08.465 --> 01:07:10.702
- It's my second.
- Oh.


1375
01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:12.536
Well, if you want to vent
about it, there's...


1376
01:07:12.569 --> 01:07:15.372
Why, why do you ask when
you know the answer already?


1377
01:07:15.405 --> 01:07:17.374
I thought maybe I caught you
on an off day.


1378
01:07:17.407 --> 01:07:18.743
Nope.

1379
01:07:18.776 --> 01:07:20.110
My bad.

1380
01:07:22.614 --> 01:07:25.750
Shit, there's another
homeless guy.


1381
01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:28.753
Shit.

1382
01:07:30.554 --> 01:07:31.856
Am I overreacting?

1383
01:07:31.889 --> 01:07:34.592
Not at all.
He could've texted or called.


1384
01:07:34.626 --> 01:07:38.328
It's not even that he treats me
bad, per se, it's just like,


1385
01:07:38.362 --> 01:07:41.331
it feels... I don't know,

1386
01:07:41.365 --> 01:07:43.668
like he doesn't even care
if I'm there or if I'm not.


1387
01:07:43.701 --> 01:07:45.670
It's just convenient.
I'm a human Fleshlight.


1388
01:07:45.703 --> 01:07:47.537
He cares about you,
obviously, I mean,


1389
01:07:47.571 --> 01:07:50.540
you guys have been together
since you were, what, 14?


1390
01:07:50.575 --> 01:07:52.509
Sixteen.

1391
01:07:52.542 --> 01:07:54.712
- On and off.
- My point is,


1392
01:07:54.746 --> 01:07:56.714
you cannot take someone
like that seriously.


1393
01:07:56.748 --> 01:07:59.249
It's like... it's like
he's a carnival ride.


1394
01:07:59.282 --> 01:08:00.952
Fun but totally unreliable.

1395
01:08:00.985 --> 01:08:02.219
Great analogy.

1396
01:08:02.252 --> 01:08:03.655
I got stuck on Zipper once.

1397
01:08:03.688 --> 01:08:06.390
It was incredibly traumatic.

1398
01:08:07.659 --> 01:08:08.893
I'm sorry.

1399
01:08:08.926 --> 01:08:11.596
I hate being that person
that's always...


1400
01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.598
crying about a boyfriend,
it's embarrassing.


1401
01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:14.832
If it makes you feel any better,

1402
01:08:14.866 --> 01:08:16.934
you're definitely the best
customer we've had all day.


1403
01:08:16.968 --> 01:08:20.470
It's true, yeah.

1404
01:08:20.504 --> 01:08:22.472
Casey, I know you don't want
to hear this,


1405
01:08:22.506 --> 01:08:24.842
but the dude is
a self-indulgent twig


1406
01:08:24.876 --> 01:08:25.977
with a faux hawk.

1407
01:08:26.010 --> 01:08:27.912
- Oh...
- I don't know the guy,


1408
01:08:27.945 --> 01:08:29.814
but that sends
a lot of red flags.


1409
01:08:29.847 --> 01:08:31.348
Kyle!

1410
01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:33.517
I was talking to myself.

1411
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:36.353
Okay, the faux hawk was a phase.

1412
01:08:36.386 --> 01:08:38.555
I can't believe
we're having this conversation.


1413
01:08:38.589 --> 01:08:41.491
Well, maybe this is the push
you need to move on.


1414
01:08:41.525 --> 01:08:43.560
Stop prolonging
your own suffering.


1415
01:08:45.897 --> 01:08:47.264
You want some more tea?

1416
01:08:47.297 --> 01:08:48.933
Oh, I have a whiskey flask
in the back.


1417
01:08:48.966 --> 01:08:50.835
I can make you a hot toddy
or something.


1418
01:08:50.868 --> 01:08:51.903
Absolutely.

1419
01:08:51.936 --> 01:08:54.271
Are you sure you want
to be drinking right now?


1420
01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:56.641
Please let me mourn
without judgment.


1421
01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:59.543
You know, the best way
to get over someone


1422
01:08:59.577 --> 01:09:01.511
is to get under someone.

1423
01:09:01.545 --> 01:09:03.915
Consider this:

1424
01:09:03.948 --> 01:09:04.882
orgy.

1425
01:09:04.916 --> 01:09:06.684
Okay, do you want to go drink
at my house?


1426
01:09:06.718 --> 01:09:07.685
- Yes!
- Okay.


1427
01:09:07.719 --> 01:09:08.953
- We're leaving.
- Can I come?


1428
01:09:08.986 --> 01:09:09.921
Nope.

1429
01:09:09.954 --> 01:09:10.855
- Why not?
- Not invited.


1430
01:09:10.888 --> 01:09:12.590
Because you have to stay here
and clean.


1431
01:09:12.623 --> 01:09:14.592
- Okay.
- Later days.


1432
01:09:14.625 --> 01:09:16.928
- I love you.
- Bye.


1433
01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:21.398
Fuck.

1434
01:09:32.076 --> 01:09:33.678
Hello?

1435
01:09:38.649 --> 01:09:41.418
Thank you for letting me eat
Lowick's pizza.


1436
01:09:41.451 --> 01:09:42.620
And his wine.

1437
01:09:42.653 --> 01:09:45.990
It was a surprise anyway,
so he won't know the difference.


1438
01:09:46.023 --> 01:09:47.759
You know, you can put
the shoe down.


1439
01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:49.894
It's not gonna make the glue
dry any faster.


1440
01:09:49.927 --> 01:09:52.362
- It's my favorite pair.
- Dude, you're fine.


1441
01:09:52.395 --> 01:09:55.465
That stuff can glue a baby
to the back of a bus.


1442
01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.670
Okay, that would never happen,
never.


1443
01:09:59.704 --> 01:10:01.739
Yeah, 'cause
the Lifetime Movie Network


1444
01:10:01.773 --> 01:10:03.540
is known for its realism.

1445
01:10:03.573 --> 01:10:05.777
Suspension of disbelief.

1446
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:07.578
Dude, now I'm in
on a Friday night.


1447
01:10:07.612 --> 01:10:08.880
Just when I was
starting to feel


1448
01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:10.413
a little bit better
about myself.


1449
01:10:10.447 --> 01:10:11.883
Hey, you're not watching alone.

1450
01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:13.651
That's true, feel you.

1451
01:10:13.684 --> 01:10:15.620
You know what?

1452
01:10:15.653 --> 01:10:19.523
So what we're not getting
shit-faced on a Friday night.


1453
01:10:19.556 --> 01:10:21.391
We're bonding!

1454
01:10:21.424 --> 01:10:23.393
Big deal!

1455
01:10:23.426 --> 01:10:26.697
I mean, there is nothing
to be ashamed of.


1456
01:10:26.731 --> 01:10:31.568
Whatever happened to real,
intellectual conversation?


1457
01:10:33.604 --> 01:10:35.372
We are watching a TV movie

1458
01:10:35.405 --> 01:10:37.474
about a teenager
trying to steal a fetus.


1459
01:10:37.507 --> 01:10:41.344
I don't think that qualifies
as intellectual conversation.


1460
01:10:41.378 --> 01:10:43.648
So then... let's talk.

1461
01:10:43.681 --> 01:10:45.817
- About what?
- Anything.


1462
01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:49.053
- Except boys.
- Or work.


1463
01:10:51.722 --> 01:10:52.957
Thanks.

1464
01:10:55.159 --> 01:10:57.460
- I have a question.
- Splash zone.


1465
01:10:59.462 --> 01:11:01.565
What, what's your question?

1466
01:11:01.599 --> 01:11:03.634
Are you guys' vaginas
symmetrical?


1467
01:11:03.668 --> 01:11:06.403
Morgan!

1468
01:11:06.436 --> 01:11:08.105
Elaborate.

1469
01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.641
I just feel like
the right side of mine


1470
01:11:10.675 --> 01:11:12.109
is just a little bit longer.

1471
01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:13.978
- The inside or the outside?
- Inside.


1472
01:11:14.011 --> 01:11:16.647
It's not hugely noticeable,
it's just...


1473
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:19.116
It just feels like
it's just a little bit longer.


1474
01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.651
Mine is like that on the left.

1475
01:11:20.685 --> 01:11:23.788
- Like you have to tuck it in?
- Ew, you guys!


1476
01:11:24.889 --> 01:11:25.923
Well, thank you.

1477
01:11:25.957 --> 01:11:27.658
That's all I needed to hear.

1478
01:11:27.692 --> 01:11:28.993
Oh my God.

1479
01:11:31.095 --> 01:11:33.030
- What?
- It's Nathan, what do I do?


1480
01:11:33.064 --> 01:11:34.866
- You ignore it.
- Mm-hmm.


1481
01:11:34.899 --> 01:11:35.933
That's what you do.

1482
01:11:35.967 --> 01:11:37.702
No, but I just want to know
what his excuse is.


1483
01:11:37.735 --> 01:11:39.436
- No, no!
- Who cares?


1484
01:11:39.469 --> 01:11:40.304
I do!

1485
01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:42.673
Casey, don't answer that,
come on.


1486
01:11:42.707 --> 01:11:44.141
Just, okay,
just talk really loud


1487
01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:45.977
like we're out and we're having
a really fun time


1488
01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:46.944
and we're at a party
or something.


1489
01:11:46.978 --> 01:11:51.548
- Just do it!
- Um, I am having so much fun!


1490
01:11:53.516 --> 01:11:56.787
Oh my God, you guys, stop,
you're hilarious!


1491
01:11:56.821 --> 01:11:57.788
Hello?

1492
01:11:57.822 --> 01:12:00.091
Hey, babe, it's me... shut up.

1493
01:12:00.124 --> 01:12:01.893
Who?

1494
01:12:01.926 --> 01:12:02.960
Nathan.

1495
01:12:02.994 --> 01:12:04.161
Oh, hey, what's up?

1496
01:12:04.195 --> 01:12:07.832
Sorry, it's just so loud
at this party that I'm at.


1497
01:12:07.865 --> 01:12:10.034
Is... is that Morgan?

1498
01:12:10.067 --> 01:12:11.802
Uh, yeah, it is.

1499
01:12:11.836 --> 01:12:12.937
She's... she's with me.

1500
01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:14.672
You know what, one second.

1501
01:12:16.073 --> 01:12:17.575
I'm in the bathroom now.

1502
01:12:17.608 --> 01:12:18.910
Sorry, crazy in there.

1503
01:12:18.943 --> 01:12:21.544
But enough about my night.
Where are you?


1504
01:12:21.579 --> 01:12:22.880
I thought we had plans.

1505
01:12:22.914 --> 01:12:24.782
Yeah, I know, look, I'm sorry,

1506
01:12:24.815 --> 01:12:27.852
but Max had tickets to go see
Chance the Rapper last minute,


1507
01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:31.554
and then my phone died,
so, um...


1508
01:12:31.589 --> 01:12:33.624
Anyway, we're at
this after-party now,


1509
01:12:33.658 --> 01:12:36.961
and I finally found a charger
so I can call you.


1510
01:12:36.994 --> 01:12:39.030
You're at... you're at
an after-party right now?


1511
01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.464
Yeah, yeah.

1512
01:12:41.498 --> 01:12:43.634
Look, I... I owe you

1513
01:12:43.668 --> 01:12:46.503
and I will make this up to you,
I promise.


1514
01:12:46.536 --> 01:12:50.540
But it sounds like you're having
a really good time anyway.


1515
01:12:50.573 --> 01:12:51.742
Yeah, I am.

1516
01:12:51.776 --> 01:12:55.980
You know, I am
at an after-party too, actually.


1517
01:12:56.013 --> 01:12:57.581
For Ludacris.

1518
01:12:57.615 --> 01:12:59.250
Wait, what, you're at an...

1519
01:12:59.283 --> 01:13:01.252
you're at an after-party
for Ludacris?


1520
01:13:01.285 --> 01:13:04.722
We are having a banging time,
and I mean that literally.


1521
01:13:04.755 --> 01:13:07.591
I let him and his rapper friends
gang-bang me


1522
01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:09.994
with their big, huge cocks!

1523
01:13:10.027 --> 01:13:12.163
Oh, oh, oh, here they come.

1524
01:13:12.196 --> 01:13:14.899
- Okay.
- Banging on the bathroom door.


1525
01:13:14.932 --> 01:13:15.800
Ooh!

1526
01:13:15.833 --> 01:13:19.704
Uh... this bathroom,
it's so shiny.


1527
01:13:19.737 --> 01:13:21.238
- So nice!
- I'm sorry,


1528
01:13:21.272 --> 01:13:22.940
what were you saying?

1529
01:13:22.974 --> 01:13:24.275
Casey, look, I'm sorry.

1530
01:13:24.308 --> 01:13:26.177
I guess I messed up, didn't I?

1531
01:13:26.210 --> 01:13:27.611
- So, um...
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,


1532
01:13:27.645 --> 01:13:29.512
it's just so hard
to hear you because


1533
01:13:29.546 --> 01:13:30.982
Pharrell jizzed
in my ears earlier,


1534
01:13:31.015 --> 01:13:34.151
and the semen is making it
really hard to hear.


1535
01:13:34.185 --> 01:13:39.290
Just a big, fat wad
of non-rubber rapper jizz


1536
01:13:39.323 --> 01:13:40.958
all in my mouth!

1537
01:13:40.992 --> 01:13:43.027
Woo! Oh, oh my God!

1538
01:13:43.060 --> 01:13:47.932
Kid Cudi, your balls
are so fucking soft!


1539
01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:52.803
Okay, you know what, um,
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?


1540
01:13:55.572 --> 01:13:57.174
He hung up.

1541
01:13:57.208 --> 01:13:59.310
You're fine.

1542
01:13:59.343 --> 01:14:02.113
Yeah, it was really articulate.

1543
01:14:09.286 --> 01:14:11.055
Hi.

1544
01:14:12.857 --> 01:14:14.925
Hi.

1545
01:14:14.959 --> 01:14:16.093
Long night?

1546
01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:20.031
Very.

1547
01:14:20.064 --> 01:14:22.600
Thought you'd be in bed by now.

1548
01:14:23.768 --> 01:14:26.103
Uh, yeah, I, uh...

1549
01:14:26.137 --> 01:14:28.105
couldn't sleep.

1550
01:14:28.139 --> 01:14:29.974
Casey wasn't feeling well,

1551
01:14:30.007 --> 01:14:33.344
so I was with her and Sage.

1552
01:14:33.377 --> 01:14:36.013
Were you?

1553
01:14:36.047 --> 01:14:41.652
Yeah, hence... leftover pizza.

1554
01:14:41.685 --> 01:14:45.222
There was more,
but the other pieces got mugged.


1555
01:14:45.256 --> 01:14:46.857
Yeah, I'm not really hungry.

1556
01:14:46.891 --> 01:14:48.092
I, um...

1557
01:14:51.762 --> 01:14:53.697
I got dinner with Jared.

1558
01:14:58.903 --> 01:15:00.204
Oh.

1559
01:15:04.175 --> 01:15:06.644
Yeah.

1560
01:15:06.677 --> 01:15:08.379
Why didn't you tell me?

1561
01:15:08.412 --> 01:15:10.714
I didn't know how.

1562
01:15:10.748 --> 01:15:14.718
Were you planning
on telling me?


1563
01:15:14.752 --> 01:15:17.621
I don't know.

1564
01:15:17.655 --> 01:15:22.093
I was embarrassed, okay?

1565
01:15:22.126 --> 01:15:24.128
You were embarrassed?

1566
01:15:25.096 --> 01:15:27.064
Imagine how I felt

1567
01:15:27.098 --> 01:15:28.632
when my best friend told me

1568
01:15:28.666 --> 01:15:30.634
that my girlfriend
fucks for money.


1569
01:15:30.668 --> 01:15:31.836
Fucked.

1570
01:15:31.869 --> 01:15:34.138
Past tense.

1571
01:15:34.171 --> 01:15:38.142
Just out of curiosity,
when was the last guy?


1572
01:15:38.175 --> 01:15:40.911
Was it the week we met?

1573
01:15:40.945 --> 01:15:44.115
Was it the day we met?

1574
01:15:48.252 --> 01:15:50.254
Okay, um...

1575
01:15:54.058 --> 01:15:56.260
Right, I guess next topic,

1576
01:15:56.293 --> 01:15:59.663
are there... are there any kids

1577
01:15:59.697 --> 01:16:01.966
that I should know about?

1578
01:16:01.999 --> 01:16:04.335
No?

1579
01:16:04.368 --> 01:16:06.670
Okay, well, that's good,
no kids.


1580
01:16:06.704 --> 01:16:08.205
Um...

1581
01:16:08.239 --> 01:16:09.707
Do you run a drug cartel?

1582
01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:10.975
I wanted to tell you.

1583
01:16:11.008 --> 01:16:12.309
God, Morgan, you...

1584
01:16:12.343 --> 01:16:14.178
you lied to me.

1585
01:16:14.211 --> 01:16:17.014
I didn't lie.

1586
01:16:17.047 --> 01:16:19.884
Come on.

1587
01:16:30.027 --> 01:16:34.732
You know, I really think that...
I need to be alone tonight.


1588
01:16:34.765 --> 01:16:36.133
Lowick, it's three
in the morning.


1589
01:16:36.167 --> 01:16:37.434
I know it's three
in the morning,


1590
01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:39.170
but I don't think
it's a good idea


1591
01:16:39.203 --> 01:16:41.472
that we be in the same room
right now.


1592
01:16:41.505 --> 01:16:43.774
- Please, let's just go to bed.
- Morgan, um,


1593
01:16:43.807 --> 01:16:45.709
I need you to leave.

1594
01:16:47.878 --> 01:16:50.714
Please.

1595
01:16:50.748 --> 01:16:54.185
I'm... please,
I'm asking you to leave.


1596
01:17:02.793 --> 01:17:04.361
I'll, um...

1597
01:17:09.033 --> 01:17:11.902
I'll, um, put the pizza
in the fridge.


1598
01:17:11.936 --> 01:17:14.138
It's your favorite, by the way.

1599
01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:17.808
Um, pepperoni and olive
on gluten-free crust,


1600
01:17:17.841 --> 01:17:20.477
even though gluten-free doesn't
really constitute as pizza,


1601
01:17:20.511 --> 01:17:22.513
but, you know, I got it anyways
because you like it,


1602
01:17:22.546 --> 01:17:25.482
- and I thought you'd want some...
- Morgan.


1603
01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:27.318
Yeah.

1604
01:17:30.821 --> 01:17:33.390
You can leave my key
on the counter.


1605
01:17:37.394 --> 01:17:40.364
Yeah, um...

1606
01:17:41.932 --> 01:17:44.935
I'll, um...

1607
01:17:44.969 --> 01:17:47.771
I'll leave it right here
next to the pizza.


1608
01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:58.075
Late night with Pharrell?

1609
01:18:58.108 --> 01:19:00.010
- Can we talk?
- No.


1610
01:19:00.044 --> 01:19:01.545
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

1611
01:19:01.579 --> 01:19:03.280
We both fucked up,
let's just reset and...


1612
01:19:03.314 --> 01:19:05.549
No, I didn't fuck up.

1613
01:19:05.583 --> 01:19:07.051
You fucked up.

1614
01:19:07.084 --> 01:19:09.219
Can we handle this
like adults, please?


1615
01:19:09.253 --> 01:19:11.555
You know what, no,
we can't handle this like adults


1616
01:19:11.589 --> 01:19:13.924
because you are not an adult.

1617
01:19:13.957 --> 01:19:15.593
- You are a child.
- Casey...


1618
01:19:15.627 --> 01:19:17.494
- And I cant do this anymore.
- Come on.


1619
01:19:17.528 --> 01:19:19.196
- I'm done.
- Doing what?


1620
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:21.932
You lie every time you say
you're coming over...


1621
01:19:21.965 --> 01:19:24.902
I will come over, it's just...
sometimes shit comes up.


1622
01:19:24.935 --> 01:19:26.136
- Shit comes up!
- Shit comes up


1623
01:19:26.170 --> 01:19:28.038
like a Chance the Rapper
fucking after-party?


1624
01:19:28.072 --> 01:19:29.406
Are you out
of your goddamn mind?


1625
01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.008
You know he's
my favorite fucking artist!


1626
01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:34.178
Oh my God!

1627
01:19:34.211 --> 01:19:35.647
What the fuck?

1628
01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:37.047
Take your bag of shit,

1629
01:19:37.081 --> 01:19:38.650
lose my number,
and get the hell out!


1630
01:19:38.683 --> 01:19:40.484
Chill the fuck out,
you're being dramatic, okay?


1631
01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:44.021
What did you just say to me?

1632
01:19:44.054 --> 01:19:45.389
You honestly think
you're not making this


1633
01:19:45.422 --> 01:19:48.292
a much bigger deal
than it is, really?


1634
01:19:50.561 --> 01:19:51.462
Fuck, what the fuck!

1635
01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:53.497
Now you're liable
to call me dramatic!


1636
01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:55.600
Oh, you fucking punched me!

1637
01:19:55.633 --> 01:19:58.001
You fucking punched me!

1638
01:19:58.035 --> 01:20:00.037
Ah, fuck!

1639
01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:04.041
I come all the way out here
to check on you...


1640
01:20:04.074 --> 01:20:05.275
and make sure you're okay.

1641
01:20:05.309 --> 01:20:08.412
The least you can do is come
outside and talk to me, babe.


1642
01:20:11.583 --> 01:20:14.284
Come on, just...

1643
01:20:14.318 --> 01:20:17.254
Just come outside
and talk to me.


1644
01:20:18.489 --> 01:20:19.691
Please.

1645
01:20:23.327 --> 01:20:25.529
Ah, fuck.

1646
01:20:27.464 --> 01:20:29.466
Thank you...
Woah, dude, what the fuck!


1647
01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.502
Number one,
don't fucking call me dramatic.


1648
01:20:31.535 --> 01:20:33.404
I didn't mean it like that,
I didn't mean it like that!


1649
01:20:33.437 --> 01:20:35.272
Two, don't call me dude!

1650
01:20:35.305 --> 01:20:36.940
Will you put
the fucking knife down?


1651
01:20:36.974 --> 01:20:38.409
And three,
I have a fucking hangover,


1652
01:20:38.442 --> 01:20:40.210
so stop pounding on my door!

1653
01:20:40.244 --> 01:20:42.279
Casey, what the fuck!

1654
01:20:45.182 --> 01:20:47.985
Get the fuck outta here,
I swear to God,


1655
01:20:48.018 --> 01:20:49.587
I'll fucking cut you!

1656
01:20:51.422 --> 01:20:53.157
Will you just stop and listen?

1657
01:20:53.190 --> 01:20:55.259
I don't know how to tell you
to calm down


1658
01:20:55.292 --> 01:20:56.126
without offending you.

1659
01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.495
Just chill out
so we can talk, okay?


1660
01:20:58.529 --> 01:21:01.165
And if you stab me,
it won't count as self-defense,


1661
01:21:01.198 --> 01:21:02.499
so please.

1662
01:21:02.533 --> 01:21:04.268
Just talk to me.

1663
01:21:05.536 --> 01:21:07.639
I think we should break up.

1664
01:21:09.006 --> 01:21:10.974
What?

1665
01:21:46.811 --> 01:21:48.245
You're back.

1666
01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:51.248
Let me guess,
they bumped you up to CEO.


1667
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:54.351
Still assistant,
but I feel very strongly


1668
01:21:54.384 --> 01:21:55.787
an offer's about to be made.

1669
01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:00.524
Celebratory drink.

1670
01:22:00.557 --> 01:22:01.759
That's fast service.

1671
01:22:01.793 --> 01:22:03.360
Yeah, I'll be right back.

1672
01:22:04.428 --> 01:22:05.797
Don't go anywhere.

1673
01:22:06.731 --> 01:22:09.566
I could also stay,
if you want company.


1674
01:22:09.601 --> 01:22:12.202
- It's not a big deal.
- No, you should go.


1675
01:22:12.236 --> 01:22:13.504
Yeah, no, I've already left.

1676
01:22:13.537 --> 01:22:15.572
- I'm not even here.
- Okay.


1677
01:22:15.607 --> 01:22:18.041
- Huh, who are you?
- Go, leave me alone.


1678
01:22:18.075 --> 01:22:19.042
Okay.

1679
01:23:57.842 --> 01:24:00.878
Oh, fuck.

1680
01:24:10.888 --> 01:24:13.390
Uh-uh, don't, no.

1681
01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:15.893
No, we offered him
two extensions.


1682
01:24:15.927 --> 01:24:17.494
This book needs
to be ready to print


1683
01:24:17.527 --> 01:24:18.663
before the end of the year.

1684
01:24:18.696 --> 01:24:21.733
If the proposal's not on my desk
by the end of this week,


1685
01:24:21.766 --> 01:24:23.467
he can take the material
somewhere else


1686
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:26.203
and stop wasting my time.

1687
01:24:29.674 --> 01:24:31.174
- Morgan.
- Yes.


1688
01:24:31.208 --> 01:24:32.744
I don't have a lot of time,
don't sit.


1689
01:24:32.777 --> 01:24:33.678
Okay.

1690
01:24:33.711 --> 01:24:35.512
Finally got word back
about that sample


1691
01:24:35.545 --> 01:24:37.547
you had me forward
to Illustration.


1692
01:24:37.582 --> 01:24:39.282
Turns out the department's
very interested.


1693
01:24:39.316 --> 01:24:41.318
- Really?
- But that's all they expressed.


1694
01:24:41.351 --> 01:24:43.888
Interest, okay?
Nothing set in stone.


1695
01:24:43.921 --> 01:24:45.590
- Okay.
- They have a few ideas they want


1696
01:24:45.623 --> 01:24:48.291
to go over, so can you set up
a meeting for next week?


1697
01:24:48.325 --> 01:24:50.494
Also, push my 5 p.m.
to next Wednesday.


1698
01:24:50.527 --> 01:24:51.863
I need to leave
the office early.


1699
01:24:51.896 --> 01:24:53.598
Yeah, absolutely.

1700
01:24:53.631 --> 01:24:57.835
Oh, why does my cappuccino
taste like a mocha?


1701
01:24:57.869 --> 01:24:59.871
Um, the barista was new,

1702
01:24:59.904 --> 01:25:02.272
so maybe she made it wrong.

1703
01:25:02.305 --> 01:25:03.775
I don't get it.
One job, make coffee,


1704
01:25:03.808 --> 01:25:05.877
and somehow it's
an impossible feat?


1705
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:07.845
Truly amazes me.

1706
01:25:07.879 --> 01:25:09.847
What are you doing here?

1707
01:25:09.881 --> 01:25:11.849
Oh, just living out
the no-condom mistake


1708
01:25:11.883 --> 01:25:12.917
my parents made.

1709
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:14.919
I meant here at work.

1710
01:25:14.952 --> 01:25:17.955
Is the answer to that
not self-explanatory?


1711
01:25:19.891 --> 01:25:21.258
- Rough morning?
- Yeah.


1712
01:25:21.291 --> 01:25:23.427
I was up until five
working on some pieces.


1713
01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:25.262
I thought Aubrey
was on the schedule.


1714
01:25:25.295 --> 01:25:26.263
Yeah, she was.

1715
01:25:26.296 --> 01:25:28.398
I got the honor
of covering her.


1716
01:25:28.432 --> 01:25:31.435
Why does she work here
if she's never going to show up?


1717
01:25:31.468 --> 01:25:33.236
Well, she doesn't work here
anymore.


1718
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:34.605
She finally got herself fired?

1719
01:25:34.639 --> 01:25:37.240
No, she booked a series regular
or something


1720
01:25:37.274 --> 01:25:41.378
on, uh, some shitty sitcom.

1721
01:25:41.411 --> 01:25:42.647
Yeah, I don't get it either.

1722
01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:43.881
I never thought
she was that funny,


1723
01:25:43.915 --> 01:25:47.952
but, hey, that just goes to show
the quality of American humor.


1724
01:25:49.352 --> 01:25:50.454
You okay?

1725
01:25:50.487 --> 01:25:51.989
Yup, fine.

1726
01:25:52.023 --> 01:25:54.524
- That's clearly a lie.
- You kidding?


1727
01:25:54.558 --> 01:25:57.327
I love when untalented people
achieve success.


1728
01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:01.431
It really... reaffirms
my life choices.


1729
01:26:15.646 --> 01:26:16.614
Check this out.

1730
01:26:16.647 --> 01:26:19.884
Ew, stop, that was on the floor!

1731
01:26:19.917 --> 01:26:22.754
Come on, let's go.

1732
01:26:22.787 --> 01:26:24.589
Hey, hey!

1733
01:26:24.622 --> 01:26:26.423
Hi, yeah, I'm talking to you.

1734
01:26:26.456 --> 01:26:28.525
First of all, you shouldn't
even be using straws


1735
01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:29.660
because our planet is dying.

1736
01:26:29.694 --> 01:26:31.428
Secondly, pick up
your used shit,


1737
01:26:31.461 --> 01:26:32.797
you fucking privileged ingrate.

1738
01:26:32.830 --> 01:26:34.732
What the hell are you doing?

1739
01:26:34.766 --> 01:26:37.501
Pick up your shit.

1740
01:26:45.375 --> 01:26:47.044
Sage!

1741
01:26:52.984 --> 01:26:55.953
The beans were actually
handpicked by Korean amputees.


1742
01:26:55.987 --> 01:26:59.023
Well, those who had hands,
anyways.


1743
01:27:01.125 --> 01:27:02.727
Uh, excuse me...

1744
01:27:07.497 --> 01:27:10.001
Sage, hey, wait up.

1745
01:27:10.034 --> 01:27:11.068
Green tea latte.

1746
01:27:11.102 --> 01:27:12.837
I wanted to... I don't know,

1747
01:27:12.870 --> 01:27:14.972
give you something
to remember me by.


1748
01:27:15.907 --> 01:27:18.876
Huh, thank you.

1749
01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:21.112
It's, uh,

1750
01:27:21.145 --> 01:27:24.347
it's really gonna suck
not working with you.


1751
01:27:24.381 --> 01:27:25.883
Yeah, well, I guess
you're gonna have to find


1752
01:27:25.917 --> 01:27:27.852
someone else
to sexually harass now, huh?


1753
01:27:27.885 --> 01:27:31.022
Oh, I've had my eye on Jeff
for a while, we're good.


1754
01:27:31.055 --> 01:27:32.355
Well, it's a good pick.

1755
01:27:32.389 --> 01:27:36.727
He's scrawny, so you'll be able
to pin him easy when he resists.


1756
01:27:36.761 --> 01:27:38.328
Yeah, yeah.

1757
01:27:42.934 --> 01:27:44.101
Yeah.

1758
01:27:44.135 --> 01:27:45.468
Well, uh...

1759
01:27:47.104 --> 01:27:49.406
Bye, Sage.

1760
01:27:50.641 --> 01:27:51.742
Bye.

1761
01:27:53.443 --> 01:27:54.779
Yeah.

1762
01:28:09.026 --> 01:28:10.695
I don't get grinding.

1763
01:28:10.728 --> 01:28:12.663
It's for people who have
nothing to talk about


1764
01:28:12.697 --> 01:28:14.599
but want to fuck.

1765
01:28:14.632 --> 01:28:16.767
So why don't they just have sex?

1766
01:28:16.801 --> 01:28:19.804
Because we live in a society
where people can't just be like,


1767
01:28:19.837 --> 01:28:22.807
"Hey, you wanna fuck?"
"Yeah, okay, cool!"


1768
01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.709
And they have to, like,
play hard-to-get


1769
01:28:24.742 --> 01:28:27.578
and keep their dignity and shit,
so they come here


1770
01:28:27.612 --> 01:28:29.046
and bang their genitals
against each other


1771
01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:31.983
so they feel like
they applied some effort.


1772
01:28:32.016 --> 01:28:35.119
It's low-culture socioecology.

1773
01:28:36.519 --> 01:28:38.890
- Oh, hello.
- Ah, perfect timing.


1774
01:28:38.923 --> 01:28:40.157
If you enjoy critical thinking,

1775
01:28:40.191 --> 01:28:41.692
you're gonna want
to check this out.


1776
01:28:41.726 --> 01:28:42.927
Move, scooch.

1777
01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.061
Oh, you need to sit here?

1778
01:28:46.998 --> 01:28:47.932
Sorry.

1779
01:28:51.936 --> 01:28:53.638
I want to make a toast.

1780
01:28:53.671 --> 01:28:56.573
To my early retirement
and inevitable suicide?


1781
01:28:56.607 --> 01:28:58.643
You guys,
I can't toast with water.


1782
01:28:58.676 --> 01:29:00.645
It's bad sex for seven years.

1783
01:29:00.678 --> 01:29:03.614
Oh, yeah, because we've had
such good sex up until now.


1784
01:29:03.648 --> 01:29:05.750
- Speak for yourself.
- Okay, Sage,


1785
01:29:05.783 --> 01:29:09.153
you can stop being upset about
the life-sucking coffeehouse


1786
01:29:09.186 --> 01:29:11.889
because
the Illustration department


1787
01:29:11.923 --> 01:29:13.758
loved your book sample.

1788
01:29:13.791 --> 01:29:14.859
- What?
- Yup.


1789
01:29:14.892 --> 01:29:16.526
They want to meet with you
next week.


1790
01:29:16.559 --> 01:29:18.528
- Congratulations.
- Are you messing with me?


1791
01:29:18.561 --> 01:29:20.598
I'm not that cruel, okay?

1792
01:29:20.631 --> 01:29:23.200
Sagey, what,
I'm so proud of you!


1793
01:29:23.234 --> 01:29:26.536
You're too talented to be stuck
behind a register anyways.


1794
01:29:26.569 --> 01:29:27.638
Yeah.

1795
01:29:27.672 --> 01:29:30.675
And I know this is only one
of many amazing things


1796
01:29:30.708 --> 01:29:33.611
that you're gonna accomplish
in your lifetime.


1797
01:29:33.644 --> 01:29:35.512
So I'm really glad
that you cussed out


1798
01:29:35.545 --> 01:29:38.215
a group of minors
and got yourself fired!


1799
01:29:38.249 --> 01:29:40.718
- Thank you.
- I love you guys.


1800
01:29:40.751 --> 01:29:42.219
Oh, we love you too.

1801
01:29:42.253 --> 01:29:43.486
What the fuck!

1802
01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:45.022
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1803
01:29:45.056 --> 01:29:46.190
Wrong with me?

1804
01:29:52.129 --> 01:29:54.999
Can I have another napkin,
please?


1805
01:29:55.032 --> 01:29:56.701
Excuse me.

1806
01:29:58.002 --> 01:29:59.070
Sorry.

1807
01:30:00.671 --> 01:30:01.839
Hi.

1808
01:30:01.872 --> 01:30:03.207
Hey.

1809
01:30:05.142 --> 01:30:08.511
Some bitch spilled my drink
on Sage, so...


1810
01:30:08.545 --> 01:30:09.512
Hi.

1811
01:30:09.546 --> 01:30:11.015
Good to see you guys.

1812
01:30:11.916 --> 01:30:13.584
Hi, I'm Morgan.

1813
01:30:13.617 --> 01:30:14.919
Sarah.

1814
01:30:14.952 --> 01:30:17.221
Love your dress, very fancy.

1815
01:30:17.254 --> 01:30:19.522
- Thank you.
- We're out celebrating


1816
01:30:19.556 --> 01:30:21.058
because Sage may get
a book deal.


1817
01:30:21.092 --> 01:30:22.893
That's amazing, congratulations.

1818
01:30:22.927 --> 01:30:24.895
Thanks!

1819
01:30:24.929 --> 01:30:26.163
What's your book about?

1820
01:30:26.197 --> 01:30:27.832
It's an art book.

1821
01:30:27.865 --> 01:30:29.834
All drawings
of morbid life moments


1822
01:30:29.867 --> 01:30:32.103
that involve coffee,
which I incidentally named


1823
01:30:32.136 --> 01:30:33.704
"The Coffee Table Book."

1824
01:30:36.007 --> 01:30:38.275
I'm not very good
at pitching it, clearly.


1825
01:30:38.309 --> 01:30:40.144
No, it sounds cute!

1826
01:30:41.812 --> 01:30:43.047
Thanks.

1827
01:30:45.216 --> 01:30:47.284
So, you're on a date then?

1828
01:30:48.252 --> 01:30:49.286
Uh, yeah.

1829
01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:51.856
This would... be a date.

1830
01:30:51.889 --> 01:30:54.225
All right, well...

1831
01:30:54.258 --> 01:30:55.126
there you go.

1832
01:30:55.159 --> 01:30:58.996
Okay, um, Sarah,
pleasure to meet you,


1833
01:30:59.030 --> 01:31:01.632
and again, lovely dress.

1834
01:31:01.665 --> 01:31:03.634
Glad you're doing well.

1835
01:31:04.802 --> 01:31:06.103
Fantastic.

1836
01:31:10.274 --> 01:31:11.709
Bye.

1837
01:31:17.314 --> 01:31:19.950
- You okay?
- Hmm.


1838
01:31:19.984 --> 01:31:21.685
If it makes you feel
any better,


1839
01:31:21.719 --> 01:31:24.321
he looked more happy to see you
than terrified.


1840
01:31:24.355 --> 01:31:26.257
I have to tell him
that I have it?


1841
01:31:26.290 --> 01:31:27.958
No, you're good.
If you have, like, herpes,


1842
01:31:27.992 --> 01:31:29.894
then you have to tell him,
but not HPV


1843
01:31:29.927 --> 01:31:31.228
because they can't get it.

1844
01:31:31.262 --> 01:31:32.930
Can we please talk

1845
01:31:32.963 --> 01:31:35.199
about that girl
all over Brett, though?


1846
01:31:35.232 --> 01:31:36.901
- Super extra.
- Right.


1847
01:31:36.934 --> 01:31:39.336
- But she's a hooker, so...
- Shut up.


1848
01:31:39.370 --> 01:31:41.739
She's been with, like,
a ton of old dudes.


1849
01:31:41.772 --> 01:31:42.706
Stop, I can't even.

1850
01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:44.375
I don't care how much money
you pay me,


1851
01:31:44.408 --> 01:31:45.943
I'd fucking kill myself.

1852
01:31:54.385 --> 01:31:56.087
It's fine, no, it's fine.

1853
01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:58.923
- You don't need to say bye.
- I'll say bye, it's fine.


1854
01:31:58.956 --> 01:32:00.224
- Don't.
- It's fine, it's fine.


1855
01:32:02.259 --> 01:32:04.762
We're leaving,
so I thought I'd say bye.


1856
01:32:04.795 --> 01:32:08.399
Cool. Wine.

1857
01:32:08.432 --> 01:32:09.834
Wow, that's good.

1858
01:32:09.867 --> 01:32:11.235
What is this?

1859
01:32:11.268 --> 01:32:13.671
Uh... Merlot.

1860
01:32:13.704 --> 01:32:15.406
That's much better
than the clearance bullshit


1861
01:32:15.439 --> 01:32:17.074
that we had on our first date.

1862
01:32:17.108 --> 01:32:18.976
You remember that, right?

1863
01:32:19.009 --> 01:32:20.744
Mmm.

1864
01:32:20.778 --> 01:32:22.713
Fucking delicious.

1865
01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:25.116
- Morgan...
- Oh, I'm sorry.


1866
01:32:25.149 --> 01:32:27.718
Did you not tell her
that we used to date?


1867
01:32:27.751 --> 01:32:29.320
- We used to date.
- Yeah, I gathered.


1868
01:32:29.353 --> 01:32:31.755
Perceptive, I love it.

1869
01:32:31.789 --> 01:32:35.092
Lowick, man, he is
such the sweet guy.


1870
01:32:35.126 --> 01:32:36.961
Morgan, we should really go.

1871
01:32:36.994 --> 01:32:38.696
Yeah, definitely, definitely,
yeah, yeah.


1872
01:32:38.729 --> 01:32:41.065
I was just telling, um...

1873
01:32:41.098 --> 01:32:43.033
- Sarah.
- ...Sarah here


1874
01:32:43.067 --> 01:32:47.104
how lucky she is to be
with such a gosh-darn sweet guy.


1875
01:32:47.138 --> 01:32:49.073
You know what I like most
about him?


1876
01:32:49.106 --> 01:32:52.109
How much he values
total honesty.


1877
01:32:52.143 --> 01:32:54.411
- I told him I loved him...
- Um, Morgan, why don't we...


1878
01:32:54.445 --> 01:32:57.047
No, don't touch me!

1879
01:32:57.081 --> 01:32:58.349
This is a really great story.

1880
01:32:58.382 --> 01:33:00.151
After we said, "I love you,"

1881
01:33:00.184 --> 01:33:02.052
he found out
that I fucked for money,


1882
01:33:02.086 --> 01:33:03.821
and he kicked me
out of his house


1883
01:33:03.854 --> 01:33:05.890
in the middle of the night
and never returned


1884
01:33:05.923 --> 01:33:08.926
a single one
of my calls or texts.


1885
01:33:08.959 --> 01:33:11.395
Man, that is rich.

1886
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:16.367
Still as funny
as the first time it happened.


1887
01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.935
Ooh.

1888
01:33:17.968 --> 01:33:19.470
I know that look.

1889
01:33:19.503 --> 01:33:21.772
That is a look of a person
finding out


1890
01:33:21.805 --> 01:33:23.374
for the very first time.

1891
01:33:23.407 --> 01:33:26.343
Did you not tell her that
you used to fuck a prostitute?


1892
01:33:26.377 --> 01:33:28.879
- Did he not tell you that?
- Hadn't gotten to that yet, no.


1893
01:33:28.913 --> 01:33:30.014
You're welcome.

1894
01:33:30.047 --> 01:33:34.318
I saved you one very awkward
conversation, my friend.


1895
01:33:34.351 --> 01:33:35.920
So please, Stacy...

1896
01:33:35.953 --> 01:33:39.323
- Sarah.
- Sarah, so close.


1897
01:33:39.356 --> 01:33:41.725
Don't worry,
I'm very much into health.


1898
01:33:41.759 --> 01:33:43.928
I got checked constantly,

1899
01:33:43.961 --> 01:33:46.197
especially after
we stopped using condoms.


1900
01:33:46.230 --> 01:33:47.398
Okay, Morgan.

1901
01:33:47.431 --> 01:33:48.532
I really think we should go.

1902
01:33:48.566 --> 01:33:51.135
Oh, I completely forgot
you guys were standing here.


1903
01:33:51.168 --> 01:33:54.038
Sarah, lovely to meet you.

1904
01:33:54.071 --> 01:33:56.173
Lowick...

1905
01:33:57.408 --> 01:33:59.944
I'm sorry.

1906
01:34:09.820 --> 01:34:11.155
Morgan, can you just wait
a second?


1907
01:34:11.188 --> 01:34:12.756
I don't want to hear
about what I should


1908
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:13.924
or should not have done.

1909
01:34:13.958 --> 01:34:15.125
I just needed to say that.

1910
01:34:15.159 --> 01:34:16.860
Why did you say all of that?

1911
01:34:16.894 --> 01:34:18.829
Can we not do this right now?

1912
01:34:18.862 --> 01:34:21.232
Sorry if I don't feel
like brushing all of that


1913
01:34:21.265 --> 01:34:25.135
under the rug
like it was nothing.


1914
01:34:25.169 --> 01:34:26.837
Did you know about this?

1915
01:34:31.809 --> 01:34:32.910
You're my best fucking friend.

1916
01:34:32.943 --> 01:34:34.411
- What were you thinking?
- Well, you're not exactly


1917
01:34:34.445 --> 01:34:36.380
the most open-minded person
that I know.


1918
01:34:36.413 --> 01:34:39.016
This is why I don't cheers
with water!


1919
01:34:39.049 --> 01:34:40.517
Casey!

1920
01:34:40.551 --> 01:34:43.420
Casey, Casey!

1921
01:34:43.454 --> 01:34:46.290
Dude, where are you going?

1922
01:34:46.323 --> 01:34:49.226
Far, far away!

1923
01:34:57.602 --> 01:34:58.869
Sage.

1924
01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:00.304
- What?
- Get up.


1925
01:35:00.337 --> 01:35:01.538
No.

1926
01:35:01.572 --> 01:35:03.440
The ground is disgusting.
Come on.


1927
01:35:03.474 --> 01:35:05.342
Whatever, we probably
already have hep C


1928
01:35:05.376 --> 01:35:07.378
from walking barefoot anyway,
so it doesn't matter.


1929
01:35:07.411 --> 01:35:11.515
I am way too tired for
this bullshit right now, okay?


1930
01:35:11.548 --> 01:35:13.884
I don't care, I'm protesting.

1931
01:35:13.917 --> 01:35:16.153
So, what, you're just gonna lay
on the ground all night?


1932
01:35:16.186 --> 01:35:18.455
If it means not walking
in awkward silence anymore,


1933
01:35:18.489 --> 01:35:20.224
yeah, absolutely.

1934
01:35:20.257 --> 01:35:22.326
You're probably laying
in dry pee.


1935
01:35:22.359 --> 01:35:24.328
At least it's not wet pee.

1936
01:35:26.363 --> 01:35:28.866
Casey!

1937
01:35:30.067 --> 01:35:32.369
If she's trying to kill herself
by running into traffic,


1938
01:35:32.403 --> 01:35:34.238
tell her none of that
sideswipe bullshit.


1939
01:35:34.271 --> 01:35:36.273
It has to be head-on.

1940
01:35:38.643 --> 01:35:40.944
Guys?

1941
01:35:40.978 --> 01:35:41.845
Oh, what the...

1942
01:35:41.879 --> 01:35:43.581
You're not supposed
to just leave me


1943
01:35:43.615 --> 01:35:46.517
in the middle of the street!

1944
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:49.253
Casey!

1945
01:35:49.286 --> 01:35:50.888
Casey, stop!

1946
01:35:50.921 --> 01:35:53.390
Someone's gonna call
the cops on us.


1947
01:35:58.329 --> 01:36:00.097
Oh, Jesus.

1948
01:36:03.167 --> 01:36:07.171
Casey, we got kicked out
last time we did this.


1949
01:36:07.204 --> 01:36:09.006
How long you gonna
ignore me for?


1950
01:36:13.043 --> 01:36:15.446
You assholes know
this unlocks, right?


1951
01:36:15.479 --> 01:36:17.181
Why are you so far behind?

1952
01:36:17.214 --> 01:36:18.949
Oh, I don't know,
maybe because you left me


1953
01:36:18.982 --> 01:36:20.250
in the middle
of the freaking street.


1954
01:36:20.284 --> 01:36:21.285
I'm sorry.

1955
01:36:23.621 --> 01:36:25.289
No.

1956
01:36:25.322 --> 01:36:26.990
- Yes.
- No.


1957
01:36:39.203 --> 01:36:40.672
God, is it cold?

1958
01:36:40.705 --> 01:36:42.139
Come on, it's not bad.

1959
01:36:42.172 --> 01:36:43.307
I think I don't believe you.

1960
01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:44.508
Oh, now it's cold.

1961
01:36:47.277 --> 01:36:48.912
Oh!

1962
01:36:48.946 --> 01:36:50.981
Eeh!

1963
01:36:51.014 --> 01:36:54.051
Why are you staring
at me like that?


1964
01:36:54.084 --> 01:36:57.287
I didn't do anything,
you should be mad at her!


1965
01:37:04.428 --> 01:37:06.163
Are you gonna get in?

1966
01:37:06.196 --> 01:37:08.600
- No.
- We're gonna peer-pressure you.


1967
01:37:08.633 --> 01:37:09.634
No.

1968
01:37:09.667 --> 01:37:11.435
Please.

1969
01:37:11.468 --> 01:37:13.303
- You have to.
- I don't want to.


1970
01:37:13.337 --> 01:37:15.105
But... but you have to.

1971
01:37:15.139 --> 01:37:17.574
- I really don't.
- Lovely in here.


1972
01:37:17.609 --> 01:37:19.109
I really fucking don't.

1973
01:37:19.143 --> 01:37:21.478
Do you wanna play colors?

1974
01:37:21.512 --> 01:37:23.447
I don't.

1975
01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:26.450
- You don't?
- No, I'm lazy.


1976
01:37:26.483 --> 01:37:28.018
Marco Polo?

1977
01:37:30.521 --> 01:37:32.389
Just get in the freaking pool!

1978
01:37:32.423 --> 01:37:34.024
Sharks?

1979
01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:35.192
What... what is that?

1980
01:37:35.225 --> 01:37:36.594
That's not even a game.

1981
01:37:36.628 --> 01:37:39.631
She's just naming
aquatic life now.


1982
01:37:39.664 --> 01:37:42.132
- Get in!
- Mermaids?


1983
01:37:42.166 --> 01:37:43.567
No, no, no!

1984
01:37:43.601 --> 01:37:46.003
Don't fucking touch me.

1985
01:37:46.036 --> 01:37:48.238
- Get in the pool.
- Fine.


1986
01:37:51.074 --> 01:37:54.511
She listens to me
if I just, like...


1987
01:37:54.545 --> 01:37:56.547
- Oh, do I?
- ...dagger her.


1988
01:37:56.581 --> 01:38:00.050
- It's nice, right?
- You are a liar.


1989
01:38:00.083 --> 01:38:02.186
I hate you.

1990
01:38:06.591 --> 01:38:08.593
You're being a baby.

1991
01:38:13.363 --> 01:38:16.033
Having so much fun tonight.

1992
01:38:16.066 --> 01:38:17.501
So...

1993
01:38:19.036 --> 01:38:21.505
So, guys, I found out

1994
01:38:21.538 --> 01:38:24.341
that I'm manic depressive,
by the way.


1995
01:38:28.613 --> 01:38:31.783
- Wait, what?
- Excuse me?


1996
01:38:31.816 --> 01:38:34.117
Yeah.

1997
01:38:34.151 --> 01:38:39.591
I got the official word,
like, six months ago.


1998
01:38:39.624 --> 01:38:43.327
So, I know why
you didn't tell me.


1999
01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:44.696
I get it.

2000
01:38:44.729 --> 01:38:47.765
Wait, so you have
a legal mental illness?


2001
01:38:49.199 --> 01:38:51.068
Apparently.

2002
01:38:51.101 --> 01:38:52.737
Does that come
with a handicap placard?


2003
01:38:52.770 --> 01:38:54.639
'Cause that could really benefit
all of us.


2004
01:38:56.073 --> 01:38:58.475
Just thinking
about the parking situation.


2005
01:38:58.509 --> 01:39:00.712
- Too soon.
- I'm thinking ahead!


2006
01:39:00.745 --> 01:39:03.080
- A bit funny.
- Planning for the future.


2007
01:39:03.113 --> 01:39:05.349
- I'm kidding!
- Help me.


2008
01:39:05.382 --> 01:39:06.784
Come here.

2009
01:39:13.758 --> 01:39:15.325
Help me, I'm bored.

2010
01:39:17.427 --> 01:39:19.263
Just roll it!

2011
01:39:19.296 --> 01:39:21.131
Okay.

2012
01:39:24.368 --> 01:39:26.804
Un-fucking-believable.

2013
01:39:26.838 --> 01:39:28.640
Can we not learn
to play another game?


2014
01:39:28.673 --> 01:39:30.440
- No.
- No.


2015
01:39:30.474 --> 01:39:32.109
Here you go, congratulations.

2016
01:39:32.142 --> 01:39:33.611
No!

2017
01:39:33.645 --> 01:39:35.112
It's olive juice, okay?

2018
01:39:35.145 --> 01:39:36.681
Your sobriety is safe,
I promise.


2019
01:39:36.714 --> 01:39:37.849
Okay, fine.

2020
01:39:41.251 --> 01:39:42.452
You disgrace me.

2021
01:39:44.856 --> 01:39:47.692
I have something to show you,
I totally forgot.


2022
01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:52.830
What is this?

2023
01:39:54.632 --> 01:39:55.465
Hmm.

2024
01:39:55.499 --> 01:39:58.335
"In the event
I never see you again,


2025
01:39:58.368 --> 01:40:01.739
it was a real displeasure
working with you.


2026
01:40:01.773 --> 01:40:04.742
When your book sells out
at Urban Outfitters,


2027
01:40:04.776 --> 01:40:06.878
I'm gonna gloat
about knowing you


2028
01:40:06.911 --> 01:40:11.315
back when you were
a super bitchy barista.


2029
01:40:11.348 --> 01:40:15.587
And I definitely won't think
of you when I jack off anymore."


2030
01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.589
- That's so cute!
- That's disgusting.


2031
01:40:17.622 --> 01:40:18.590
I think it's funny.

2032
01:40:18.623 --> 01:40:19.456
- It is.
- Thank you.


2033
01:40:19.489 --> 01:40:23.160
"Best of luck
in this shitty world.


2034
01:40:23.193 --> 01:40:25.128
Kyle."

2035
01:40:26.731 --> 01:40:29.901
"In case you ever... lover..."

2036
01:40:29.934 --> 01:40:31.368
- Lower.
- "Lower."


2037
01:40:31.401 --> 01:40:33.537
- Lower.
- His handwriting is very shitty.


2038
01:40:33.570 --> 01:40:36.506
"...your standards,
you know where to find me.


2039
01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:38.241
Let's fuck each other up."

2040
01:40:38.275 --> 01:40:39.877
Oh my God, I love him.

2041
01:40:39.911 --> 01:40:41.478
- Really?
- Yeah.


2042
01:40:41.511 --> 01:40:42.814
He's a weirdo.

2043
01:40:42.847 --> 01:40:44.682
Wait, you're not actually
gonna call him.


2044
01:40:44.716 --> 01:40:46.918
He is so greasy, Sage.

2045
01:40:46.951 --> 01:40:48.786
Of course she's gonna call him.

2046
01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:50.755
Weirdos do all
the fun, kinky shit.


2047
01:40:51.789 --> 01:40:53.390
Do you think his cum is greasy?

2048
01:40:53.423 --> 01:40:55.593
Okay, I am not...
not at that level yet.


2049
01:40:55.627 --> 01:40:57.327
Grease jizz!

2050
01:40:57.361 --> 01:40:58.796
Yes!

2051
01:40:58.830 --> 01:41:00.397
New addition to the team.

2052
01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:01.531
He's not greasy!

2053
01:41:01.565 --> 01:41:04.936
Why do you guys always have
to circle back to jizz?


2054
01:41:04.969 --> 01:41:07.504
- Why not? Why should we not?
- Anything else.


2055
01:41:07.537 --> 01:41:09.272
- Why is she shushing us?
- I don't know.


2056
01:41:09.306 --> 01:41:10.908
- You're judging me.
- Is Kyle, like, outside?


2057
01:41:10.942 --> 01:41:14.378
- Of course I'm judging you.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.


2058
01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:21.418
I don't want your jizz
grease breath on me!


2059
01:41:21.451 --> 01:41:23.755
Ew, why am I talking
about jizz now?


2060
01:41:23.788 --> 01:41:26.791
- You guys have changed me.
- You're corrupted!


2061
01:41:26.824 --> 01:41:28.325
I'm sorry, honey.

2062
01:41:32.529 --> 01:41:34.564
You scared the shit out...

2063
01:41:34.599 --> 01:41:36.299
You bitch!

2064
01:41:37.969 --> 01:41:39.569
Got 'em.

2065
01:41:39.604 --> 01:41:41.639
Yeah, you did.

2066
01:41:41.673 --> 01:41:44.241
When was the last time
you shaved your legs?


2067
01:41:44.274 --> 01:41:45.542
Give me your hand.

2068
01:41:48.278 --> 01:41:52.382
I like Kyle now, he loves
our girl for who she is.


2069
01:41:52.416 --> 01:41:54.351
Even with hairy legs.

2070
01:41:55.987 --> 01:41:58.690
I'm leaving you, I'm going pee.
I'm done with you guys.


2071
01:41:58.723 --> 01:42:00.524
- Go pee.
- Okay, bye.


2072
01:42:00.557 --> 01:42:03.427
- Yeah, I'm leaving.
- Love you, mean it.


2073
01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:05.562
I hope you enjoy
your life without me,


2074
01:42:05.596 --> 01:42:07.464
'cause it's gonna be
a long one.


2075
01:42:07.497 --> 01:42:09.499
- Sagey.
- A very long life.


2076
01:42:09.533 --> 01:42:10.968
Okay, wait, don't leave us.

2077
01:42:11.002 --> 01:42:12.837
We're a lesbian tribe!

2078
01:42:14.739 --> 01:42:17.842
- It's too late, I'm gone.
- Okay, bye then.


2079
01:42:17.875 --> 01:42:19.409
I'm dead and I'm dying.

2080
01:42:19.443 --> 01:42:21.344
We'll survive without you.

2081
01:42:21.378 --> 01:42:23.781
- No, we won't, actually.
- No?
