Hey!

3
00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.375
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

4
00:02:05.463 --> 00:02:08.382
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>


5
00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:10.009
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

6
00:02:10.092 --> 00:02:12.428
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>


7
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:16.348
<i>and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Re√°l in a dead heat.</i>


8
00:02:16.432 --> 00:02:17.933
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

9
00:02:18.017 --> 00:02:21.479
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>


10
00:02:21.562 --> 00:02:25.608
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>


11
00:02:25.691 --> 00:02:27.443
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

12
00:02:27.526 --> 00:02:30.279
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>


13
00:02:30.363 --> 00:02:31.822
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>


14
00:02:31.906 --> 00:02:36.077
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>


15
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.954
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>


16
00:02:39.038 --> 00:02:40.414
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>


17
00:02:40.498 --> 00:02:41.415
<i>Now wait... 
Now hang on.</i>

18
00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.751
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>


19
00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:44.877
<i>Under my administration,</i>

20
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.756
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>


21
00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:52.343
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>


22
00:02:52.426 --> 00:02:54.720
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>


23
00:02:54.804 --> 00:02:55.763
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

24
00:02:55.846 --> 00:02:57.139
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

25
00:02:57.223 --> 00:02:58.182
<i>But listen...</i>

26
00:02:58.265 --> 00:02:59.683
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>


27
00:02:59.767 --> 00:03:01.227
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

28
00:03:05.731 --> 00:03:06.732
Hey.

29
00:03:09.193 --> 00:03:10.903
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

30
00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:17.785
Why is she still tied?

31
00:03:22.373 --> 00:03:25.376
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.


32
00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:34.885
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.


33
00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:36.846
Just call me in the morning, okay?

34
00:03:40.057 --> 00:03:42.476
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>


35
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.104
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>


36
00:03:45.187 --> 00:03:47.857
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>


37
00:05:06.644 --> 00:05:09.647
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

38
00:05:22.493 --> 00:05:25.246
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>


39
00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:30.084
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

40
00:05:33.587 --> 00:05:37.049
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

41
00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:40.052
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

42
00:05:41.554 --> 00:05:43.055
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

43
00:05:44.098 --> 00:05:45.808
<i>Watching.</i>

44
00:05:47.393 --> 00:05:51.814
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>


45
00:05:57.194 --> 00:05:59.989
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

46
00:06:13.627 --> 00:06:15.463
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.


47
00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:18.257
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!


48
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.842
<i>It's a big city.</i>

49
00:06:24.472 --> 00:06:26.182
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

50
00:06:36.776 --> 00:06:38.694
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

51
00:06:43.866 --> 00:06:45.618
Look at this guy, man.

52
00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:51.791
Boom!

53
00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:53.125
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

54
00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:58.714
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!


55
00:06:58.798 --> 00:07:00.216
Yo, let's see your hits.

56
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.426
That's you.

57
00:07:22.905 --> 00:07:26.826
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>


58
00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:30.788
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

59
00:07:31.664 --> 00:07:33.666
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

60
00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:36.794
<i>It's a warning.</i>

61
00:07:38.587 --> 00:07:39.588
<i>To them.</i>

62
00:07:49.306 --> 00:07:50.516
<i>Fear...</i>

63
00:07:53.853 --> 00:07:55.646
<i>is a tool.</i>

64
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:09.910
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!


65
00:08:21.756 --> 00:08:24.300
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

66
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:28.262
Come on!

67
00:08:36.687 --> 00:08:38.606
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

68
00:08:57.375 --> 00:08:58.959
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!


69
00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:01.420
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!


70
00:09:01.504 --> 00:09:02.963
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?


71
00:09:03.923 --> 00:09:05.174
Help!

72
00:09:05.257 --> 00:09:06.467
Somebody help me!

73
00:09:07.259 --> 00:09:09.261
Help, help!

74
00:09:16.143 --> 00:09:17.353
Where you goin', huh?

75
00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:23.109
Come on.

76
00:09:23.192 --> 00:09:24.860
Come on, man. Break it.

77
00:09:27.029 --> 00:09:28.447
You can't move, huh?

78
00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:30.533
Now knock his ass out.

79
00:09:30.616 --> 00:09:32.326
Showtime. Showtime, man.

80
00:09:32.868 --> 00:09:33.953
Come on, man.

81
00:09:34.036 --> 00:09:35.287
Come on. Do it, man.

82
00:10:10.614 --> 00:10:12.241
You see this guy?

83
00:10:19.457 --> 00:10:21.083
The hell are you supposed to be?

84
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.393
I'm vengeance.

85
00:10:40.519 --> 00:10:42.438
Holy shit. It's him.

86
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.256
Hey, man. No, no, no!

87
00:11:51.006 --> 00:11:52.383
Please don't hurt me.

88
00:12:28.419 --> 00:12:30.004
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

89
00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.798
Police action.

90
00:12:33.382 --> 00:12:35.051
He's with me, Officer.

91
00:12:37.303 --> 00:12:38.888
Are you kidding me, sir?

92
00:12:39.805 --> 00:12:41.557
You're gonna let him in here?

93
00:12:42.224 --> 00:12:45.019
Martinez, let him through.

94
00:12:58.657 --> 00:13:00.409
Goddamn freak.

95
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.385
What do we know?

96
00:13:28.229 --> 00:13:29.605
Detective?

97
00:13:29.688 --> 00:13:31.315
Sorry, Lieutenant.

98
00:13:32.191 --> 00:13:36.696
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.


99
00:13:37.446 --> 00:13:40.616
He got hit a
lot of times. And hard.

100
00:13:43.786 --> 00:13:45.413
All this blood is from his head?

101
00:13:45.871 --> 00:13:46.872
No.

102
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:52.420
Excuse me.

103
00:13:54.714 --> 00:13:56.590
Most of it's from his hand.

104
00:14:02.054 --> 00:14:03.097
Thumb was severed.

105
00:14:04.724 --> 00:14:06.934
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

106
00:14:07.309 --> 00:14:09.228
He was alive when it was cut off.

107
00:14:10.521 --> 00:14:11.939
Ecchymosis...

108
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:14.734
around the wound.

109
00:14:29.957 --> 00:14:31.667
Security detail downstairs

110
00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:33.961
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.


111
00:14:35.463 --> 00:14:37.673
The mayor was up here alone.

112
00:14:40.092 --> 00:14:42.803
Killer may have come
through the skylight.


113
00:14:49.185 --> 00:14:50.978
You said there was a card.

114
00:14:51.062 --> 00:14:52.646
Yeah.

115
00:15:02.782 --> 00:15:05.826
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

116
00:15:07.119 --> 00:15:08.829
Haven't a clue?

117
00:15:08.913 --> 00:15:11.290
Let's play a game, just me and you.

118
00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:14.877
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

119
00:15:16.212 --> 00:15:18.297
There's a cipher too.

120
00:15:25.054 --> 00:15:26.931
Any of this mean anything to you?

121
00:15:29.475 --> 00:15:30.684
What's going on here?

122
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:35.189
I asked him to come, Pete.

123
00:15:35.272 --> 00:15:36.941
This is a crime scene.

124
00:15:37.024 --> 00:15:39.360
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

125
00:15:39.443 --> 00:15:41.445
I got the press downstairs.

126
00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:44.281
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.


127
00:15:44.365 --> 00:15:46.200
But this is way over the line.

128
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:50.955
Wait.

129
00:15:51.038 --> 00:15:52.748
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.


130
00:15:52.832 --> 00:15:53.958
How do you know?

131
00:15:54.041 --> 00:15:57.044
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!


132
00:15:57.128 --> 00:15:58.879
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.


133
00:15:58.963 --> 00:16:00.589
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.


134
00:16:00.673 --> 00:16:02.216
He lies still.

135
00:16:03.718 --> 00:16:04.719
Excuse me?

136
00:16:06.262 --> 00:16:07.346
The riddle.

137
00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:11.350
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.


138
00:16:20.484 --> 00:16:21.986
Oh, Jesus.

139
00:16:25.239 --> 00:16:28.034
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?


140
00:16:29.035 --> 00:16:30.870
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

141
00:16:31.662 --> 00:16:33.289
Excuse me, Commissioner.

142
00:16:34.373 --> 00:16:36.042
They're ready for your statement.

143
00:16:40.087 --> 00:16:41.797
I want him outta here.

144
00:16:42.423 --> 00:16:43.507
Now!

145
00:16:50.097 --> 00:16:51.307
Come on.

146
00:17:04.111 --> 00:17:05.321
Yeah.

147
00:17:06.572 --> 00:17:07.990
The kid found him.

148
00:17:12.995 --> 00:17:15.998
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?


149
00:17:32.431 --> 00:17:34.600
We really gotta go, man.

150
00:17:40.189 --> 00:17:43.901
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

151
00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.195
A wife lost a husband.

152
00:17:47.405 --> 00:17:48.948
And I lost a friend.

153
00:17:50.032 --> 00:17:52.576
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,


154
00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:55.746
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.


155
00:17:56.205 --> 00:17:58.374
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

156
00:17:59.125 --> 00:18:02.545
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>


157
00:18:02.628 --> 00:18:06.716
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>


158
00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:08.050
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

159
00:18:08.134 --> 00:18:10.970
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>


160
00:18:11.053 --> 00:18:12.638
<i>but I don't know.</i>

161
00:18:18.561 --> 00:18:21.439
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

162
00:18:21.522 --> 00:18:23.607
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

163
00:18:24.358 --> 00:18:25.693
<i>And now this.</i>

164
00:18:27.862 --> 00:18:29.447
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

165
00:18:32.158 --> 00:18:33.409
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

166
00:18:35.494 --> 00:18:37.788
<i>But I have to try.</i>

167
00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:39.832
<i>Push myself.</i>

168
00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.422
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

169
00:19:29.382 --> 00:19:31.300
<i>behind the mask.</i>

170
00:19:35.805 --> 00:19:38.099
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

171
00:19:39.892 --> 00:19:42.061
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

172
00:19:44.438 --> 00:19:46.023
<i>everything that happened.</i>

173
00:20:00.579 --> 00:20:02.164
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>


174
00:20:02.248 --> 00:20:06.127
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>


175
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.046
<i>was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>


176
00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.881
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

177
00:20:10.965 --> 00:20:12.633
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

178
00:20:12.717 --> 00:20:14.218
<i>still have not been released,</i>

179
00:20:14.301 --> 00:20:17.179
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>


180
00:20:17.263 --> 00:20:20.516
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>


181
00:20:20.641 --> 00:20:22.435
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

182
00:20:22.518 --> 00:20:25.062
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>


183
00:20:25.146 --> 00:20:29.400
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>


184
00:20:29.483 --> 00:20:31.235
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>


185
00:20:31.318 --> 00:20:33.279
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

186
00:20:33.362 --> 00:20:36.198
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>


187
00:20:36.282 --> 00:20:40.119
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>


188
00:20:40.202 --> 00:20:41.996
<i>Don Mitchell, 
Jr.'s political career</i>

189
00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:44.749
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>


190
00:20:44.832 --> 00:20:48.085
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>


191
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:52.131
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>


192
00:20:52.214 --> 00:20:56.385
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>


193
00:20:56.469 --> 00:20:57.887
I assume you heard about this.

194
00:20:59.764 --> 00:21:01.015
Yeah.

195
00:21:08.022 --> 00:21:09.356
Oh, I see.

196
00:21:10.191 --> 00:21:12.109
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

197
00:21:12.651 --> 00:21:13.861
Dear God.

198
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.663
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

199
00:21:32.671 --> 00:21:34.965
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

200
00:21:38.135 --> 00:21:39.929
The killer left this for the Batman?

201
00:21:41.347 --> 00:21:43.015
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

202
00:21:43.099 --> 00:21:44.100
Apparently.

203
00:21:44.392 --> 00:21:46.268
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

204
00:21:48.312 --> 00:21:49.647
Why is he writing to you?

205
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:51.148
<i>It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!</i>

206
00:21:51.232 --> 00:21:52.274
I don't know yet.

207
00:21:52.358 --> 00:21:53.901
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

208
00:21:55.778 --> 00:21:57.196
Have a shower.

209
00:21:58.656 --> 00:22:00.324
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises


210
00:22:00.408 --> 00:22:01.325
are coming for breakfast.

211
00:22:01.409 --> 00:22:03.411
Here? Why?

212
00:22:03.494 --> 00:22:04.578
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

213
00:22:04.662 --> 00:22:05.746
I haven't got time for this.

214
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:07.498
It's getting serious, Bruce.

215
00:22:07.581 --> 00:22:10.668
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.


216
00:22:10.751 --> 00:22:12.336
I don't care about that.

217
00:22:13.254 --> 00:22:14.130
Any of that.

218
00:22:14.213 --> 00:22:15.715
You don't care about
your family's legacy?


219
00:22:18.092 --> 00:22:21.220
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

220
00:22:21.303 --> 00:22:23.472
If I can't change things here,

221
00:22:24.014 --> 00:22:25.933
if I can't have an effect,

222
00:22:27.017 --> 00:22:28.644
then I don't care what happens to me.

223
00:22:28.728 --> 00:22:29.854
That's what I'm afraid of.

224
00:22:29.937 --> 00:22:31.564
Alfred, stop.

225
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:34.400
You're not my father.

226
00:22:37.194 --> 00:22:38.612
I'm well aware.

227
00:23:12.938 --> 00:23:15.191
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

228
00:23:40.841 --> 00:23:42.426
Some fresh berries there.

229
00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.726
What are you doing?

230
00:23:51.102 --> 00:23:54.772
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.


231
00:23:55.147 --> 00:23:59.068
This is actually quite elusive.

232
00:24:02.071 --> 00:24:03.739
Where'd you get those O's?

233
00:24:05.282 --> 00:24:08.077
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

234
00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.579
It only gives us H,
E, L, I, S, and T.

235
00:24:10.663 --> 00:24:14.709
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,


236
00:24:14.792 --> 00:24:16.168
see where it leads.

237
00:24:18.087 --> 00:24:19.088
That's interesting.

238
00:24:20.339 --> 00:24:21.465
Mr. Pennyworth?

239
00:24:21.841 --> 00:24:22.842
Yes, Dory?

240
00:24:23.175 --> 00:24:24.635
The accountants are here.

241
00:24:24.719 --> 00:24:26.554
See them in, please, Dory.

242
00:24:29.473 --> 00:24:31.684
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

243
00:24:31.767 --> 00:24:33.352
What do you mean?

244
00:24:33.436 --> 00:24:35.271
What if this is the whole key?

245
00:24:36.188 --> 00:24:38.733
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.


246
00:24:38.816 --> 00:24:40.860
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...


247
00:24:40.943 --> 00:24:42.111
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

248
00:24:42.194 --> 00:24:44.321
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.


249
00:24:44.405 --> 00:24:46.240
I don't see how that's gonna...

250
00:24:48.784 --> 00:24:49.785
Oh.

251
00:25:03.591 --> 00:25:05.259
Damn.

252
00:25:05.426 --> 00:25:07.678
Yeah, he's got a car.

253
00:25:08.596 --> 00:25:10.973
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

254
00:25:11.057 --> 00:25:12.725
Where to even start?

255
00:25:13.309 --> 00:25:15.644
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.


256
00:25:15.728 --> 00:25:16.729
You don't trust me?

257
00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:19.356
You mean like you trust me?

258
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.318
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.


259
00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.446
There.

260
00:25:48.552 --> 00:25:49.845
What are we looking for?

261
00:25:50.471 --> 00:25:52.014
A USB port.

262
00:25:52.098 --> 00:25:53.224
USB?

263
00:26:00.314 --> 00:26:01.482
What?

264
00:26:06.862 --> 00:26:09.115
"Thumb" drive.

265
00:26:09.907 --> 00:26:11.534
Jesus.

266
00:26:15.162 --> 00:26:16.664
It's encrypted.

267
00:26:20.084 --> 00:26:21.377
Try this.

268
00:26:28.384 --> 00:26:30.761
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

269
00:26:39.645 --> 00:26:42.231
Oh, well, well, well.

270
00:26:42.648 --> 00:26:44.900
So much for family values.

271
00:26:45.067 --> 00:26:46.235
Who is she?

272
00:26:46.318 --> 00:26:47.903
No idea.

273
00:26:48.821 --> 00:26:51.657
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.


274
00:26:51.991 --> 00:26:53.492
I know who he is.

275
00:26:53.951 --> 00:26:54.952
What was that?

276
00:26:56.704 --> 00:26:59.540
Shit, shit! The drive.

277
00:27:00.291 --> 00:27:02.626
It sent out the photos from my account.

278
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:05.254
<i>Gotham Post, 
Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

279
00:27:05.337 --> 00:27:07.423
Jesus.

280
00:27:07.506 --> 00:27:09.884
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.


281
00:27:09.967 --> 00:27:11.427
"He lies still."

282
00:27:11.635 --> 00:27:12.678
About her?

283
00:27:13.929 --> 00:27:15.514
Maybe.

284
00:27:15.681 --> 00:27:17.558
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

285
00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:21.062
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.


286
00:27:21.145 --> 00:27:23.272
Never get in there without a warrant.

287
00:27:25.608 --> 00:27:26.692
Yeah.

288
00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:40.998
Know who I am?

289
00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:44.585
Yeah. I got an idea.

290
00:27:45.044 --> 00:27:46.462
I want to see the Penguin.

291
00:27:47.171 --> 00:27:49.423
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.


292
00:27:54.804 --> 00:27:55.805
What's the problem?

293
00:27:55.888 --> 00:27:57.306
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

294
00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.558
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

295
00:27:59.642 --> 00:28:01.268
That's what I tried to tell him.

296
00:28:01.352 --> 00:28:03.646
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

297
00:28:03.729 --> 00:28:05.606
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.


298
00:28:06.982 --> 00:28:08.067
Mine or yours?

299
00:28:16.409 --> 00:28:17.368
Get him!

300
00:28:17.451 --> 00:28:18.619
I saw that whole thing.

301
00:28:18.703 --> 00:28:19.912
He's over there!

302
00:28:19.995 --> 00:28:21.330
What is your problem?

303
00:29:03.998 --> 00:29:06.167
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!


304
00:29:16.761 --> 00:29:18.179
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

305
00:29:18.304 --> 00:29:20.431
Take it easy, sweetheart.

306
00:29:20.514 --> 00:29:22.308
You looking for me?

307
00:29:23.017 --> 00:29:24.935
I see you met the twins.

308
00:29:25.895 --> 00:29:29.190
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?


309
00:29:30.066 --> 00:29:31.567
I guess we both are.

310
00:29:33.611 --> 00:29:35.029
How you doing?

311
00:29:35.654 --> 00:29:37.073
I'm Oz.

312
00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.871
Who is she?

313
00:29:46.916 --> 00:29:48.834
I really don't know, chief.

314
00:29:49.543 --> 00:29:51.754
I might have been coming out
at the same time,


315
00:29:51.837 --> 00:29:53.214
but I wasn't rolling with them.

316
00:30:06.644 --> 00:30:07.645
It's okay, baby.

317
00:30:08.187 --> 00:30:11.982
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.


318
00:30:37.717 --> 00:30:38.926
Thank you, honey.

319
00:30:45.433 --> 00:30:47.268
Here you go, champ.

320
00:30:47.351 --> 00:30:50.896
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.


321
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.773
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.


322
00:30:53.274 --> 00:30:54.650
Is that the mayor?

323
00:30:54.734 --> 00:30:56.527
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

324
00:30:57.737 --> 00:30:59.030
Don't make me hurt you.

325
00:30:59.113 --> 00:31:03.284
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?


326
00:31:03.367 --> 00:31:06.328
Yeah, I do. Do you?

327
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.582
Look...

328
00:31:10.833 --> 00:31:13.627
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

329
00:31:14.462 --> 00:31:18.758
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.


330
00:31:27.099 --> 00:31:28.684
Tell you one thing.

331
00:31:30.853 --> 00:31:34.440
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

332
00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.443
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.


333
00:31:40.696 --> 00:31:42.531
What? Too soon?

334
00:31:52.375 --> 00:31:54.752
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.


335
00:32:04.053 --> 00:32:05.054
Taxi!

336
00:32:07.556 --> 00:32:08.557
Taxi!

337
00:32:27.326 --> 00:32:28.619
Hey, it's me.

338
00:32:29.912 --> 00:32:31.247
Baby, what's wrong?

339
00:32:31.914 --> 00:32:33.916
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...


340
00:32:36.377 --> 00:32:37.795
On the news?

341
00:32:38.462 --> 00:32:41.757
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?


342
00:32:41.841 --> 00:32:43.551
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

343
00:32:44.719 --> 00:32:48.347
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.


344
00:32:49.056 --> 00:32:51.684
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.


345
00:32:52.601 --> 00:32:53.769
Uh...

346
00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.314
God damn it.

347
00:33:17.293 --> 00:33:19.295
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>


348
00:33:19.378 --> 00:33:21.255
<i>with a younger mystery woman.</i>

349
00:33:21.338 --> 00:33:24.175
<i>In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...</i>


350
00:33:57.625 --> 00:34:00.544
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

351
00:36:15.054 --> 00:36:16.389
You're pretty good at that.

352
00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:50.131
Hey! Give me that.

353
00:36:53.759 --> 00:36:56.303
"Kosolov, Annika."

354
00:36:57.805 --> 00:36:59.890
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

355
00:36:59.974 --> 00:37:02.727
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...


356
00:37:40.806 --> 00:37:43.434
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?


357
00:37:43.517 --> 00:37:45.978
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.


358
00:37:46.062 --> 00:37:47.438
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,


359
00:37:47.521 --> 00:37:49.273
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.


360
00:37:49.356 --> 00:37:50.733
What does she know?

361
00:37:50.816 --> 00:37:52.943
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.


362
00:37:53.027 --> 00:37:54.612
She did seem upset.

363
00:37:56.405 --> 00:37:57.907
Back at your place.

364
00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:01.452
Let's go talk to her.

365
00:38:27.645 --> 00:38:28.729
Anni!

366
00:38:30.022 --> 00:38:31.107
Baby!

367
00:38:32.691 --> 00:38:33.776
Anni!

368
00:38:37.822 --> 00:38:39.073
Anni!

369
00:38:41.534 --> 00:38:42.910
<i>It's gonna be cool this evening.</i>

370
00:38:42.993 --> 00:38:45.204
<i>It's gonna be down into the 40s.</i>

371
00:38:45.746 --> 00:38:47.164
<i>More breaking news this hour</i>

372
00:38:47.248 --> 00:38:52.628
<i>as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.</i>


373
00:38:52.712 --> 00:38:55.005
<i>And this time, the killer has
come forward to claim credit online...</i>


374
00:38:55.089 --> 00:38:57.925
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.


375
00:38:59.802 --> 00:39:01.554
Shit, they took my phone.

376
00:39:01.637 --> 00:39:03.013
<i>His victim, longtime head

<i>inside the Police Athletic League
facilities in the Tricorner area.</i>


380
00:39:10.104 --> 00:39:13.441
<i>The killer posted the following message
on social media,</i>


381
00:39:13.524 --> 00:39:16.402
<i>and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.</i>


382
00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:24.201
<i>Hello, people of Gotham.</i>

383
00:39:24.285 --> 00:39:26.245
<i>This is the Riddler speaking.</i>

384
00:39:27.747 --> 00:39:29.373
<i>On Halloween night,</i>

385
00:39:29.457 --> 00:39:34.253
<i>I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.</i>


386
00:39:34.336 --> 00:39:36.380
<i>But I am not done.</i>

387
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.719
<i>Here is another...</i>

388
00:39:46.223 --> 00:39:49.018
<i>who will soon be losing face.</i>

389
00:39:50.352 --> 00:39:54.565
<i>I will kill again, and again, and again,</i>

390
00:39:54.648 --> 00:39:56.484
<i>until our day of judgment</i>

391
00:39:56.567 --> 00:40:01.572

392
00:40:02.365 --> 00:40:04.367

393
00:40:05.951 --> 00:40:07.703
<i>Goodbye!</i>

394
00:40:11.957 --> 00:40:13.584
<i>Commissioner Savage

<i>30-year career on the GCPD...</i>

396
00:40:15.878 --> 00:40:18.089
Holy shit, I seen that guy too.

397
00:40:19.465 --> 00:40:20.466
At the club.

398
00:40:22.134 --> 00:40:23.552
The Iceberg Lounge?

399
00:40:24.303 --> 00:40:25.763
44 Below.

400
00:40:27.681 --> 00:40:28.682
What is that?

401
00:40:31.936 --> 00:40:33.479
The club within the club.

402
00:40:34.563 --> 00:40:36.482
The real club.

403
00:40:38.776 --> 00:40:40.528
It's a mob hangout.

404
00:40:40.986 --> 00:40:42.405
Is that where you work?

405
00:40:44.323 --> 00:40:45.157
Selina?

406
00:40:51.038 --> 00:40:52.915
No, I just work the bar upstairs.

407
00:40:56.377 --> 00:40:57.920
But I see 'em come in.

408
00:40:58.003 --> 00:40:59.213
Who?

409
00:40:59.797 --> 00:41:02.216
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.


410
00:41:03.801 --> 00:41:06.470
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

411
00:41:08.723 --> 00:41:10.266
You're gonna help me on this.

412
00:41:10.891 --> 00:41:12.393
For your friend.

413
00:41:22.987 --> 00:41:24.321
You got a lot of cats.

414
00:41:25.823 --> 00:41:27.742
I have a thing about strays.

415
00:41:31.871 --> 00:41:33.205
You're not safe here.

416
00:41:34.331 --> 00:41:35.499
I can take care of myself.

417
00:41:35.583 --> 00:41:38.377
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>


418
00:41:38.461 --> 00:41:40.004
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

419
00:41:40.087 --> 00:41:43.340
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>


420
00:41:43.424 --> 00:41:46.260
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>


421
00:42:04.278 --> 00:42:07.448
He waited for him at the gym.

422
00:42:08.574 --> 00:42:10.618
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,


423
00:42:10.701 --> 00:42:12.828
when no one else was around.

424
00:42:13.954 --> 00:42:15.373
There's a needle mark on his neck.

425
00:42:15.456 --> 00:42:17.416
Injected him with arsenic.

426
00:42:19.418 --> 00:42:20.753
Rat poison.

427
00:42:21.545 --> 00:42:23.130
Yeah.

428
00:42:23.297 --> 00:42:25.758
That seems to be his theme here.

429
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.676
Look at this thing.

430
00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:37.561
It's a maze.

431
00:42:40.147 --> 00:42:43.442
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?


432
00:42:46.195 --> 00:42:47.279
More symbols.

433
00:42:49.782 --> 00:42:51.367
It's another cipher.

434
00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.203
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.


435
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:57.456
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

436
00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:00.668
That guy pushes drops. 
On the east end.

437
00:43:02.253 --> 00:43:03.587
I don't get it.

438
00:43:03.671 --> 00:43:06.048
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?


439
00:43:06.966 --> 00:43:08.968
Looks like he got greedy.

440
00:43:09.051 --> 00:43:10.094
You kidding me?

441
00:43:10.177 --> 00:43:12.888
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?


442
00:43:12.972 --> 00:43:16.225
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?


443
00:43:16.308 --> 00:43:18.519
Maybe he's not who you thought.

444
00:43:20.062 --> 00:43:22.106
You make it sound
like he had it coming.

445
00:43:24.358 --> 00:43:25.818
He was a cop.

446
00:43:27.153 --> 00:43:28.446
Crossed a line.

447
00:43:59.685 --> 00:44:01.353
"I'm mad about you.

448
00:44:01.437 --> 00:44:05.107
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."


449
00:44:12.239 --> 00:44:15.326
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

450
00:44:15.493 --> 00:44:19.080
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."


451
00:44:19.163 --> 00:44:20.873
The hell is that?

452
00:44:21.624 --> 00:44:24.794
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?


453
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:27.421
I don't know.

454
00:44:28.297 --> 00:44:29.465
Lieutenant.

455
00:44:29.548 --> 00:44:30.966
They're coming back.

456
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.301
We got to get out of here.

457
00:44:36.389 --> 00:44:37.598
Come on.

458
00:44:42.686 --> 00:44:43.729
Ow!

459
00:44:45.189 --> 00:44:46.524
I don't know about these things.

460
00:44:46.607 --> 00:44:50.069
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.


461
00:44:54.073 --> 00:44:56.659
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?


462
00:44:58.536 --> 00:44:59.995
I'm just looking for Annika.

463
00:45:04.291 --> 00:45:05.918
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

464
00:45:07.044 --> 00:45:09.672
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?


465
00:45:19.223 --> 00:45:20.433
Look at me.

466
00:45:30.067 --> 00:45:32.236
Looks good. Here.

467
00:46:15.404 --> 00:46:17.406
I got you. Can you hear me?

468
00:46:18.366 --> 00:46:19.367
Yeah.

469
00:46:28.042 --> 00:46:29.043
Hey, where you goin'?

470
00:46:29.668 --> 00:46:30.795
Hospitality.

471
00:46:31.545 --> 00:46:34.382
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>


472
00:46:36.175 --> 00:46:37.676
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

473
00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:46.435
"Kenzie, William."

474
00:46:46.519 --> 00:46:47.978
He's an off-duty cop.

475
00:46:49.855 --> 00:46:51.524
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?


476
00:46:51.857 --> 00:46:53.901
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

477
00:47:10.459 --> 00:47:13.587
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.


478
00:47:13.671 --> 00:47:14.797
Great.

479
00:47:22.054 --> 00:47:24.348
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?


480
00:47:24.432 --> 00:47:26.016
Feels good, doesn't it?

481
00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:28.310
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

482
00:47:34.358 --> 00:47:35.985
<i>Jesus, I hate dropheads.</i>

483
00:47:36.068 --> 00:47:37.111
Really?

484
00:47:37.194 --> 00:47:38.154
'Cause when I first saw you,

485
00:47:38.237 --> 00:47:39.447
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.


486
00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:41.782
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...


487
00:47:42.408 --> 00:47:44.160
Can we not do this right now?

488
00:47:46.078 --> 00:47:47.621
Wait. Who was that?

489
00:47:47.705 --> 00:47:48.873
Oh, I saw him.

490
00:47:48.956 --> 00:47:50.041
<i>Look back.</i>

491
00:47:50.124 --> 00:47:51.917
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.


492
00:47:52.001 --> 00:47:53.335
I need to see his face.

493
00:47:55.004 --> 00:47:56.464
Jesus.

494
00:48:04.472 --> 00:48:05.639
That's the DA.

495
00:48:05.723 --> 00:48:06.766
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

496
00:48:06.849 --> 00:48:08.517
And he's coming over. You happy?

497
00:48:08.601 --> 00:48:09.810
<i>Talk to him.</i>

498
00:48:12.938 --> 00:48:14.023
Hey. How you doing?

499
00:48:14.106 --> 00:48:15.191
Hi.

500
00:48:15.274 --> 00:48:16.108
I'm Gil.

501
00:48:17.318 --> 00:48:18.944
Hey, aren't you the DA?

502
00:48:19.028 --> 00:48:19.987
Yeah.

503
00:48:20.196 --> 00:48:22.365
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

504
00:48:22.448 --> 00:48:23.824
Is that right?

505
00:48:24.241 --> 00:48:26.452
I haven't seen you around here before.

506
00:48:27.453 --> 00:48:29.497
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,


507
00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:32.124
'cause people are all a little on edge.

508
00:48:32.208 --> 00:48:33.709
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

509
00:48:33.793 --> 00:48:34.794
<i>Is that right?</i>

510
00:48:35.086 --> 00:48:36.295
<i>I like that.</i>

511
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:37.713
Do you want to come over?

512
00:48:37.797 --> 00:48:38.923
Sure.

513
00:48:41.926 --> 00:48:43.260
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>


514
00:48:43.344 --> 00:48:44.762
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

515
00:48:45.054 --> 00:48:46.931
- <i>Richie, Glen.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>


516
00:48:48.391 --> 00:48:49.892
That's half the DA's office.

517
00:48:49.975 --> 00:48:51.143
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

518
00:48:51.227 --> 00:48:52.186
Hi.

519
00:48:52.269 --> 00:48:54.313
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.


520
00:48:54.397 --> 00:48:56.273
Drowning our sorrows.

521
00:48:56.607 --> 00:48:57.900
<i>You want a drop?</i>

522
00:48:57.983 --> 00:49:00.027
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>


523
00:49:01.987 --> 00:49:03.656
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

524
00:49:03.739 --> 00:49:05.783
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>


525
00:49:06.242 --> 00:49:07.201
He's wasted.

526
00:49:07.284 --> 00:49:08.327
No shit.

527
00:49:09.995 --> 00:49:10.996
<i>I like this girl.</i>

528
00:49:11.455 --> 00:49:13.040
Oh, hey, I like you too!

529
00:49:16.585 --> 00:49:19.922
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>


530
00:49:20.005 --> 00:49:21.090
<i>He knows so much.</i>

531
00:49:21.173 --> 00:49:22.466
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

532
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:24.802
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>


533
00:49:24.885 --> 00:49:25.803
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

534
00:49:25.886 --> 00:49:27.805
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.


535
00:49:27.888 --> 00:49:29.849
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.


536
00:49:31.851 --> 00:49:33.686
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

537
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:45.239
<i>I mean...</i>

538
00:49:46.073 --> 00:49:49.660
<i>there was a rat. 
We had an informant.</i>

539
00:49:50.244 --> 00:49:52.663
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>


540
00:49:52.747 --> 00:49:54.457
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>


541
00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.125
He's talking about the Maroni case.

542
00:49:56.208 --> 00:49:59.503
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>


543
00:50:00.087 --> 00:50:02.381
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>


544
00:50:02.465 --> 00:50:04.383
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

545
00:50:04.467 --> 00:50:07.094
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>


546
00:50:07.178 --> 00:50:08.429
What do you know about that?

547
00:50:10.056 --> 00:50:11.223
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

548
00:50:11.307 --> 00:50:12.266
<i>I want a drink.</i>

549
00:50:12.433 --> 00:50:13.684
Keep him talking.

550
00:50:16.771 --> 00:50:17.855
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

551
00:50:17.938 --> 00:50:18.981
She knows Annika.

552
00:50:19.065 --> 00:50:20.483
No, stay on the DA.

553
00:50:20.566 --> 00:50:22.485
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

554
00:50:24.612 --> 00:50:26.739
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.


555
00:50:26.822 --> 00:50:27.865
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

556
00:50:27.948 --> 00:50:30.493
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>


557
00:50:30.576 --> 00:50:31.827
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

558
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:34.372
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

559
00:50:34.455 --> 00:50:37.375
There's no problem. 
It's just girl talk.

560
00:50:37.458 --> 00:50:38.959
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>


561
00:50:39.043 --> 00:50:40.127
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

562
00:50:44.882 --> 00:50:45.925
<i>Hey.</i>

563
00:50:46.509 --> 00:50:47.593
Hey.

564
00:50:48.761 --> 00:50:51.931
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.


565
00:50:53.224 --> 00:50:54.433
How you been?

566
00:50:56.769 --> 00:50:58.479
Yeah, I've been okay.

567
00:50:59.814 --> 00:51:01.190
<i>I was just...</i>

568
00:51:03.234 --> 00:51:05.069
I was just headed back upstairs.

569
00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:06.821
Well...

570
00:51:07.905 --> 00:51:09.573
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

571
00:51:23.671 --> 00:51:26.048
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.


572
00:51:26.132 --> 00:51:27.717
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.


573
00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.593
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>


574
00:51:29.677 --> 00:51:31.512
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>


575
00:51:31.595 --> 00:51:32.680
Wait, what are you doing?

576
00:51:32.763 --> 00:51:35.182
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!


577
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:40.771
Taxi!

578
00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:45.735
Hey!

579
00:51:47.445 --> 00:51:48.529
I lost you in there.

580
00:51:48.612 --> 00:51:49.697
Yeah, I gotta go.

581
00:51:50.573 --> 00:51:51.991
Oh, you need a ride?

582
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.993
That's me right there.

583
00:52:00.082 --> 00:52:01.167
Taxi!

584
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:02.376
I'm good.

585
00:52:04.086 --> 00:52:05.504
I hope, uh...

586
00:52:10.092 --> 00:52:11.510
I'll see you around.

587
00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:41.976
Just hold still.

588
00:54:40.326 --> 00:54:41.243
What do you know about

589
00:54:41.327 --> 00:54:43.621
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?


590
00:54:46.707 --> 00:54:48.417
Yeah, sure, there was.

591
00:54:49.126 --> 00:54:50.961
That's the rat we're looking for.

592
00:54:51.879 --> 00:54:53.756
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

593
00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:57.343
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.


594
00:54:57.426 --> 00:54:58.886
Where are you getting this?

595
00:54:58.969 --> 00:55:01.847
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.


596
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.100
Gil's very nervous.

597
00:55:05.059 --> 00:55:07.603
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.


598
00:55:07.686 --> 00:55:09.563
I worked that case.

599
00:55:09.647 --> 00:55:11.607
Riddler's not after you.

600
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:12.608
How do you know?

601
00:55:12.983 --> 00:55:14.402
You're not corrupt.

602
00:55:15.444 --> 00:55:16.987
Colson's dirty?

603
00:55:22.868 --> 00:55:24.370
Maybe I, uh...

604
00:55:25.037 --> 00:55:28.374
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.


605
00:55:28.457 --> 00:55:31.752
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.


606
00:55:32.503 --> 00:55:34.296
Who knows how many people it touches.

607
00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:37.591
Politicians. Police. The courts.

608
00:55:38.884 --> 00:55:40.594
It could tear the whole city apart.

609
00:55:41.011 --> 00:55:43.055
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

610
00:55:44.682 --> 00:55:46.434
And Riddler's the match.

611
00:55:47.309 --> 00:55:48.477
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

612
00:55:48.561 --> 00:55:49.854
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

613
00:55:49.937 --> 00:55:51.355
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>


614
00:55:51.439 --> 00:55:52.940
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

615
00:55:53.983 --> 00:55:55.568
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>


616
00:55:55.651 --> 00:55:57.319
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>


617
00:55:58.446 --> 00:55:59.905
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

618
00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:01.032
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

619
00:56:01.115 --> 00:56:02.742
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>


620
00:56:02.825 --> 00:56:04.660
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>


621
00:56:04.744 --> 00:56:05.995
Pretty.

622
00:56:07.997 --> 00:56:09.373
She a new friend of yours?

623
00:56:13.961 --> 00:56:15.171
I'm not so sure.

624
00:56:16.005 --> 00:56:17.506
Looks like you upset her.

625
00:56:18.674 --> 00:56:20.801
Shall I take this as a good sign?

626
00:56:20.885 --> 00:56:21.886
What?

627
00:56:21.969 --> 00:56:22.887
Your attire.

628
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:25.097
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?


629
00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:27.183
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.


630
00:56:27.266 --> 00:56:29.935
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.


631
00:56:30.978 --> 00:56:32.563
Riddler might not be able to resist.

632
00:56:32.646 --> 00:56:34.106
Oh, that reminds me.

633
00:56:35.274 --> 00:56:39.236
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.


634
00:56:39.779 --> 00:56:41.280
The one from the rat maze.

635
00:56:41.697 --> 00:56:44.784
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

636
00:56:45.117 --> 00:56:46.994
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,


637
00:56:47.078 --> 00:56:50.331
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

638
00:56:50.956 --> 00:56:52.375
<i>Rata Alada?</i>

639
00:56:52.458 --> 00:56:53.667
"Rat with wings"?

640
00:56:53.751 --> 00:56:56.253
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?


641
00:56:56.337 --> 00:56:57.588
Yeah.

642
00:56:59.048 --> 00:57:00.174
A stool pigeon.

643
00:57:00.424 --> 00:57:02.051
Where are your cufflinks?

644
00:57:02.134 --> 00:57:03.094
I couldn't find them.

645
00:57:04.553 --> 00:57:06.514
Well, you can't go out like that.

646
00:57:06.597 --> 00:57:08.391
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

647
00:57:12.561 --> 00:57:15.356
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.


648
00:57:17.066 --> 00:57:19.276
And what about you? 
Are you a Wayne?

649
00:57:20.277 --> 00:57:22.071
Your father gave them to me.

650
00:57:27.827 --> 00:57:30.955
No more lies! No more lies!

651
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:52.101
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.


652
00:58:04.655 --> 00:58:06.407
Is that Bruce Wayne?

653
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:09.118
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!


654
00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:19.211
Hold it.

655
00:58:20.546 --> 00:58:21.797
You good, fellas?

656
00:58:22.381 --> 00:58:23.382
Good.

657
00:58:25.509 --> 00:58:26.594
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

658
00:58:44.403 --> 00:58:45.404
Sir?

659
00:59:05.091 --> 00:59:06.050
Hey!

660
00:59:06.133 --> 00:59:08.135
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?


661
00:59:09.095 --> 00:59:10.930
Hey, watch it, fellas.

662
00:59:11.389 --> 00:59:13.682
You got the prince of the city there.

663
00:59:16.519 --> 00:59:18.354
Some event, huh?

664
00:59:18.437 --> 00:59:21.399
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.


665
00:59:21.482 --> 00:59:23.943
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

666
00:59:24.026 --> 00:59:25.653
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?


667
00:59:25.736 --> 00:59:27.738
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

668
00:59:28.614 --> 00:59:30.032
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

669
00:59:30.658 --> 00:59:32.118
Wow. Is that right?

670
00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:34.245
His father saved my life.

671
00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:38.416
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

672
00:59:39.625 --> 00:59:43.129
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.


673
00:59:43.421 --> 00:59:46.632
Operated right on the dining room table.

674
00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:51.971
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.


675
00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:55.391
I remember your face.

676
00:59:57.393 --> 00:59:59.353
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?


677
00:59:59.729 --> 01:00:01.856
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

678
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:04.775
"Hippocratic oath."

679
01:00:07.319 --> 01:00:08.529
That's good.

680
01:00:09.071 --> 01:00:10.239
Excuse me.

681
01:00:13.826 --> 01:00:14.660
Yes.

682
01:00:28.841 --> 01:00:29.925
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

683
01:00:30.009 --> 01:00:31.594
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>


684
01:00:31.677 --> 01:00:34.055
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

685
01:00:34.138 --> 01:00:35.931
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

686
01:00:36.015 --> 01:00:37.433
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

687
01:00:37.516 --> 01:00:38.934
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>


688
01:00:39.018 --> 01:00:40.436
<i>consider a donation to</i>

689
01:00:40.519 --> 01:00:42.563
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

690
01:00:42.646 --> 01:00:44.899
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

691
01:00:44.982 --> 01:00:46.192
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

692
01:00:46.567 --> 01:00:49.111
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?


693
01:00:50.196 --> 01:00:53.949
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.


694
01:00:54.033 --> 01:00:57.244
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.


695
01:00:58.245 --> 01:01:00.122
He got what he deserved.

696
01:01:02.041 --> 01:01:03.042
Know what I mean?

697
01:01:04.335 --> 01:01:06.462
Hey, don't I know you?

698
01:01:06.545 --> 01:01:07.630
Bruce Wayne.

699
01:01:08.547 --> 01:01:10.508
Why haven't you called me back?

700
01:01:10.591 --> 01:01:11.592
I'm sorry?

701
01:01:11.884 --> 01:01:14.220
I'm Bella Re√°l. 
I'm running for mayor.

702
01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:15.513
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

703
01:01:15.596 --> 01:01:18.265
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.


704
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:19.683
Will you walk with me?

705
01:01:24.855 --> 01:01:26.190
Mr. Wayne.

706
01:01:26.273 --> 01:01:27.483
Mr. Wayne.

707
01:01:28.192 --> 01:01:31.278
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.


708
01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:33.698
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,


709
01:01:33.781 --> 01:01:36.200
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.


710
01:01:36.283 --> 01:01:38.744
If I'm elected, 
I want to change that.

711
01:01:39.328 --> 01:01:40.621
Thank you.

712
01:01:41.497 --> 01:01:42.498
My God.

713
01:01:44.333 --> 01:01:46.836
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?


714
01:01:46.919 --> 01:01:48.546
I want to continue this.

715
01:01:52.758 --> 01:01:53.634
Excuse me.

716
01:01:55.678 --> 01:01:57.555
I'm so sorry for your loss.

717
01:01:59.765 --> 01:02:00.683
Thank you.

718
01:02:00.766 --> 01:02:02.518
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?


719
01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:05.730
Gil Colson is missing.

720
01:02:05.813 --> 01:02:07.106
What?

721
01:02:07.189 --> 01:02:09.483
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.


722
01:02:09.567 --> 01:02:10.609
Christ, not again.

723
01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:12.778
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

724
01:02:15.072 --> 01:02:17.116
You got people looking for him, Jim?

725
01:02:17.783 --> 01:02:20.077
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.


726
01:02:20.161 --> 01:02:21.078
What'd his wife say?

727
01:02:21.162 --> 01:02:22.371
She hadn't heard from him.

728
01:03:17.134 --> 01:03:18.052
Get out of the car!

729
01:03:18.803 --> 01:03:21.013
Get out of the
car and show your hands!

730
01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:23.641
Get out!

731
01:03:34.151 --> 01:03:35.444
Get 'em up!

732
01:03:35.528 --> 01:03:37.279
Get out! Show 'em!

733
01:03:41.742 --> 01:03:43.327
Christ, it's Colson.

734
01:03:43.411 --> 01:03:45.121
There's a bomb around his neck!

735
01:04:00.177 --> 01:04:01.721
Let's clear this place out now!

736
01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.431
We've got to get this place cleared out!

737
01:04:37.673 --> 01:04:40.426
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

738
01:04:43.429 --> 01:04:44.847
We don't know if he's in on it.

739
01:04:47.975 --> 01:04:49.310
What's he looking at?

740
01:05:08.079 --> 01:05:09.413
Holy shit.

741
01:05:10.456 --> 01:05:12.124
Are you kidding me?

742
01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:14.960
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

743
01:05:15.795 --> 01:05:18.255
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.


744
01:05:34.021 --> 01:05:35.231
Please.

745
01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:38.150
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.


746
01:05:38.567 --> 01:05:40.778
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.


747
01:05:40.861 --> 01:05:41.862
I'm so sorry.

748
01:05:42.363 --> 01:05:44.031
Looks like a combination lock.

749
01:05:44.115 --> 01:05:45.574
Can't we just cut it off?

750
01:05:46.325 --> 01:05:47.993
Not if you want to keep your head.

751
01:06:24.697 --> 01:06:25.948
<i>You came.</i>

752
01:06:27.783 --> 01:06:28.868
Who are you?

753
01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:30.411
<i>Me?</i>

754
01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:34.415
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

755
01:06:35.875 --> 01:06:38.294
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

756
01:06:38.377 --> 01:06:42.673
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>


757
01:06:43.215 --> 01:06:44.300
"Unmask"?

758
01:06:44.383 --> 01:06:45.551
<i>Yes.</i>

759
01:06:46.385 --> 01:06:49.221
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

760
01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:51.724
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

761
01:06:52.391 --> 01:06:54.727
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

762
01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.604
How am I a part of this?

763
01:06:56.687 --> 01:06:58.606
<i>You'll see.</i>

764
01:06:58.689 --> 01:07:00.441
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.


765
01:07:00.524 --> 01:07:02.610
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

766
01:07:02.693 --> 01:07:03.944
<i>We're live.</i>

767
01:07:04.028 --> 01:07:07.031
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

768
01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.408
<i>At the moment,</i>

769
01:07:09.492 --> 01:07:12.870
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

770
01:07:12.953 --> 01:07:13.996
<i>is dead.</i>

771
01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.082
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!


772
01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:17.124
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

773
01:07:17.208 --> 01:07:20.336
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>


774
01:07:20.419 --> 01:07:23.422
<i>You hear me?</i>

775
01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:24.507
Okay.

776
01:07:33.265 --> 01:07:35.351
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

777
01:07:37.103 --> 01:07:39.271
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

778
01:07:41.315 --> 01:07:42.358
<i>Now,</i>

779
01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:46.153
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

780
01:07:46.237 --> 01:07:49.824
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

781
01:07:50.408 --> 01:07:52.827
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

782
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:56.247
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

783
01:07:56.330 --> 01:08:01.544
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>


784
01:08:01.627 --> 01:08:03.879
You want me to do puzzles?

785
01:08:03.963 --> 01:08:06.716
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

786
01:08:06.799 --> 01:08:10.886
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>


787
01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:13.305
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.


788
01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:15.558
Okay, okay. So I just...

789
01:08:15.641 --> 01:08:16.726
You want me to...

790
01:08:16.851 --> 01:08:19.186
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

791
01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:22.898
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

792
01:08:22.982 --> 01:08:27.653
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>


793
01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:30.156
Wait, wait, wait! 
Can you repeat that?

794
01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:31.323
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

795
01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.825
- "Justice."
- Huh?


796
01:08:32.908 --> 01:08:33.951
The answer's "justice."

797
01:08:34.035 --> 01:08:35.244
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>


798
01:08:35.327 --> 01:08:36.912
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>


799
01:08:36.996 --> 01:08:41.333
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>


800
01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:43.794
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>


801
01:08:43.878 --> 01:08:46.255
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

802
01:08:46.338 --> 01:08:47.548
Of course, of course. Of course.

803
01:08:47.631 --> 01:08:50.009
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

804
01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:54.221
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

805
01:08:54.305 --> 01:08:58.476
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

806
01:08:58.559 --> 01:09:00.352
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."


807
01:09:00.436 --> 01:09:01.687
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

808
01:09:01.771 --> 01:09:03.939
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.


809
01:09:05.357 --> 01:09:06.484
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

810
01:09:06.567 --> 01:09:07.818
- How much?
- Nothing!


811
01:09:07.902 --> 01:09:10.112
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.


812
01:09:10.196 --> 01:09:12.490
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.


813
01:09:12.573 --> 01:09:13.407
What cases?

814
01:09:13.491 --> 01:09:14.617
He didn't ask me that!

815
01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:15.701
Come on! Ten grand.

816
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:19.121
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>


817
01:09:19.205 --> 01:09:21.832
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

818
01:09:21.916 --> 01:09:25.753
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>


819
01:09:25.836 --> 01:09:28.255
<i>Last riddle.</i>

820
01:09:28.339 --> 01:09:32.676
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

821
01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:37.056
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>


822
01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:39.225
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.


823
01:09:39.308 --> 01:09:41.852
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.


824
01:09:41.936 --> 01:09:43.729
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?


825
01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:45.022
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

826
01:09:45.106 --> 01:09:46.774
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.


827
01:09:46.857 --> 01:09:48.818
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?


828
01:09:48.901 --> 01:09:50.444
If I go out
this way, it's just me.

829
01:09:50.528 --> 01:09:53.656
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.


830
01:09:53.739 --> 01:09:55.199
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?


831
01:09:55.282 --> 01:09:56.617
- People are watching.
- What people?


832
01:09:56.701 --> 01:09:58.828
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.


833
01:09:58.911 --> 01:10:01.080
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>


834
01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:02.039
<i>Four!</i>

835
01:10:02.123 --> 01:10:03.499
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>


836
01:10:03.582 --> 01:10:05.459
<i>Goodbye!</i>

837
01:10:35.656 --> 01:10:37.033
Who do you think he is under there?

838
01:10:37.116 --> 01:10:37.950
Take it easy.

839
01:10:38.034 --> 01:10:39.035
I want to see.

840
01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:41.579
What is that thing? Leather?

841
01:10:45.332 --> 01:10:46.792
What's he got on his eyes?

842
01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:48.335
Who cares?
I want to see his face.


843
01:10:48.419 --> 01:10:49.628
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...


844
01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:50.880
Hey!

845
01:10:51.464 --> 01:10:54.592
Hey! Hey! Hey!

846
01:10:54.675 --> 01:10:56.343
Relax, God damn it!

847
01:10:56.427 --> 01:10:57.928
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

848
01:10:59.346 --> 01:11:01.891
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.


849
01:11:01.974 --> 01:11:04.393
Colson's blood is on his hands.

850
01:11:04.477 --> 01:11:05.895
Maybe it's on yours.

851
01:11:07.354 --> 01:11:08.397
What'd you say?

852
01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:10.066
He would rather die than talk.

853
01:11:10.649 --> 01:11:12.151
What was he afraid of?

854
01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:13.986
You?

855
01:11:21.118 --> 01:11:22.536
You son of a bitch.

856
01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:26.123
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?


857
01:11:26.207 --> 01:11:27.917
You could be an accessory to murder.

858
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.001
Why are we playing games...

859
01:11:31.128 --> 01:11:32.004
Get him! Come on!

860
01:11:32.088 --> 01:11:34.090
Back off! Back off!

861
01:11:34.173 --> 01:11:36.467
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!


862
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:38.636
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!


863
01:11:38.719 --> 01:11:41.514
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!


864
01:11:44.183 --> 01:11:45.726
You too now?

865
01:11:45.810 --> 01:11:48.354
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.


866
01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:51.023
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?


867
01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:53.359
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.


868
01:11:56.153 --> 01:11:57.655
Okay, give him the room.

869
01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:14.588
Two minutes.

870
01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:27.935
You listen to me.

871
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.522
We gotta get you out of here.

872
01:12:33.190 --> 01:12:35.151
That would put a
lot of heat on you.

873
01:12:35.234 --> 01:12:36.902
Well, you punched me in the face.

874
01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:40.448
Take this key.

875
01:12:41.741 --> 01:12:45.119
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.


876
01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:47.872
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?


877
01:12:48.873 --> 01:12:51.167
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

878
01:12:54.545 --> 01:12:56.922
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

879
01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:03.054
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

880
01:13:03.137 --> 01:13:06.057
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.


881
01:13:06.974 --> 01:13:09.602
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?


882
01:13:12.313 --> 01:13:14.273
Or he moonlights as a cop.

883
01:13:18.861 --> 01:13:20.363
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!


884
01:13:20.446 --> 01:13:21.947
Somebody stop him!

885
01:14:00.152 --> 01:14:01.696
- There he is!
- Freeze!


886
01:14:48.075 --> 01:14:49.994
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.


887
01:14:50.536 --> 01:14:51.746
I did.

888
01:14:51.829 --> 01:14:55.207
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?


889
01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:57.334
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

890
01:14:57.418 --> 01:14:58.544
I only trust you.

891
01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:00.963
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?


892
01:15:01.047 --> 01:15:04.425
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.


893
01:15:05.176 --> 01:15:06.302
You think Penguin's the rat?

894
01:15:06.385 --> 01:15:09.430
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.


895
01:15:09.513 --> 01:15:11.474
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.


896
01:15:11.557 --> 01:15:12.892
DA was a regular too.

897
01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:16.479
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.


898
01:15:17.563 --> 01:15:18.773
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

899
01:15:18.856 --> 01:15:19.815
The what?

900
01:15:19.899 --> 01:15:21.358
Riddler's latest.

901
01:15:21.442 --> 01:15:23.152
The cipher in the maze.

902
01:15:23.235 --> 01:15:25.738
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.


903
01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:28.949
A penguin's got wings too.

904
01:15:30.951 --> 01:15:32.912
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.


905
01:15:32.995 --> 01:15:34.663
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.


906
01:15:34.747 --> 01:15:37.958
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.


907
01:15:38.042 --> 01:15:41.212
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.


908
01:15:43.839 --> 01:15:45.674
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

909
01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:47.927
There's Penguin.

910
01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:49.887
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

911
01:15:51.514 --> 01:15:52.765
<i>You want to move in?</i>

912
01:15:54.642 --> 01:15:56.102
<i>Let's follow.</i>

913
01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:18.165
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.


914
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:19.542
<i>I'm here.</i>

915
01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.628
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?


916
01:16:22.712 --> 01:16:25.214
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.


917
01:16:44.442 --> 01:16:46.986
It's a drug lab. Drops.

918
01:16:47.069 --> 01:16:48.279
This is a buy.

919
01:16:48.362 --> 01:16:51.532
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.


920
01:16:51.615 --> 01:16:52.783
Or they never shut it down at all.

921
01:16:52.867 --> 01:16:53.743
<i>What are you saying?</i>

922
01:16:53.826 --> 01:16:56.954
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?


923
01:17:21.312 --> 01:17:22.730
This just got complicated.

924
01:17:23.481 --> 01:17:24.648
What do you mean?

925
01:17:30.571 --> 01:17:32.031
Hey! What happened?

926
01:17:32.114 --> 01:17:33.449
You all right?

927
01:17:44.168 --> 01:17:45.961
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

928
01:17:46.087 --> 01:17:47.713
Jesus.

929
01:17:48.464 --> 01:17:50.299
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

930
01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.134
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

931
01:17:52.218 --> 01:17:53.928
Is that why you work in the club?

932
01:17:54.678 --> 01:17:55.721
It was all just a score?

933
01:17:55.805 --> 01:17:59.600
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...


934
01:18:00.976 --> 01:18:02.895
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

935
01:18:14.198 --> 01:18:15.157
Jesus!

936
01:18:43.769 --> 01:18:44.895
Hey, Vengeance!

937
01:18:47.064 --> 01:18:49.775
You think you can
come after my money, huh?


938
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:32.276
Kenzie! Get the money!

939
01:19:37.698 --> 01:19:38.949
Hey! What the...

940
01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:30.918
Whoa!

941
01:20:34.130 --> 01:20:35.715
Come on! Come on!

942
01:20:38.884 --> 01:20:40.219
This guy's crazy!

943
01:20:41.971 --> 01:20:43.681
Come on! Hey!

944
01:21:33.147 --> 01:21:34.148
Move!

945
01:22:38.963 --> 01:22:40.840
Get out of the way!

946
01:22:51.976 --> 01:22:53.060
Come on!

947
01:23:01.777 --> 01:23:02.903
Get out of the way!

948
01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:42.193
I got you!

949
01:23:43.444 --> 01:23:44.779
I got you!

950
01:23:44.862 --> 01:23:47.198
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

951
01:23:47.281 --> 01:23:48.741
I got you!

952
01:25:05.192 --> 01:25:08.029
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?


953
01:25:08.112 --> 01:25:10.740
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?


954
01:25:10.823 --> 01:25:12.116
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

955
01:25:12.199 --> 01:25:13.617
Cops caught you doing something.

956
01:25:13.701 --> 01:25:15.327
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.


957
01:25:15.411 --> 01:25:17.288
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.


958
01:25:17.371 --> 01:25:19.498
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

959
01:25:19.582 --> 01:25:20.791
His drops operation.

960
01:25:20.875 --> 01:25:23.335
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,


961
01:25:23.419 --> 01:25:27.048
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.


962
01:25:27.131 --> 01:25:28.883
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,


963
01:25:28.966 --> 01:25:31.302
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.


964
01:25:31.385 --> 01:25:34.597
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.


965
01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:35.848
What are you, crazy?

966
01:25:35.931 --> 01:25:37.016
That why you killed the girl?

967
01:25:37.099 --> 01:25:38.059
I didn't kill no girl!

968
01:25:38.142 --> 01:25:39.935
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.


969
01:25:40.019 --> 01:25:41.312
But she got too close, right?

970
01:25:41.395 --> 01:25:43.606
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.


971
01:25:43.689 --> 01:25:45.649
But somehow Riddler found out too.

972
01:25:45.733 --> 01:25:47.651
He knows so much about you.

973
01:25:47.735 --> 01:25:49.779
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?


974
01:25:50.363 --> 01:25:52.573
Boy, you guys are a
hell of a duet here.

975
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:54.158
Why don't you start harmonizing?

976
01:25:54.492 --> 01:25:57.161
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?


977
01:25:57.244 --> 01:25:58.579
I ain't no rat!

978
01:25:58.662 --> 01:26:00.498
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me


979
01:26:00.581 --> 01:26:01.665
if he heard this kind of talk?

980
01:26:01.749 --> 01:26:03.918
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?


981
01:26:04.001 --> 01:26:06.545
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.


982
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:08.172
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

983
01:26:08.255 --> 01:26:09.882
- This was around his head!
- Come on!


984
01:26:09.965 --> 01:26:11.884
Open your eyes!

985
01:26:15.805 --> 01:26:17.390
Are you <i>El Rata Alada?</i>

986
01:26:17.473 --> 01:26:18.974
<i>El Rata Alada?</i>

987
01:26:19.058 --> 01:26:20.893
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.


988
01:26:20.976 --> 01:26:23.312
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.


989
01:26:23.396 --> 01:26:25.981
It says you are <i>El Rata Alada.</i>

990
01:26:26.065 --> 01:26:27.441
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

991
01:26:27.525 --> 01:26:28.734
Why, you got something to tell us?

992
01:26:28.818 --> 01:26:29.694
Yeah!

993
01:26:30.361 --> 01:26:31.404
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.


994
01:26:31.487 --> 01:26:32.321
What?

995
01:26:32.738 --> 01:26:34.073
It's <i>"La."</i>

996
01:26:34.156 --> 01:26:35.449
<i>"La" rata.</i>

997
01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:37.952
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?


998
01:26:38.035 --> 01:26:39.912
Jesus! Look at you two.

999
01:26:40.329 --> 01:26:42.581
World's greatest detectives!

1000
01:26:42.998 --> 01:26:45.292
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>


1001
01:26:45.376 --> 01:26:46.460
Jesus!

1002
01:26:46.544 --> 01:26:48.045
<i>No habla espa√±ol,</i> fellas?

1003
01:26:48.129 --> 01:26:50.131
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1004
01:26:51.549 --> 01:26:52.633
You think he made a mistake?

1005
01:26:52.717 --> 01:26:53.926
He doesn't make mistakes.

1006
01:26:54.009 --> 01:26:55.052
A rat with wings?

1007
01:26:55.136 --> 01:26:56.721
You know what that sounds like to me?

1008
01:26:56.804 --> 01:26:59.974
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?


1009
01:27:00.057 --> 01:27:02.059
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

1010
01:27:07.690 --> 01:27:11.569
"You are <i>el."</i>

1011
01:27:20.244 --> 01:27:21.746
Maybe it was a mistake.

1012
01:27:22.163 --> 01:27:22.997
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1013
01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:23.914
Wait.

1014
01:27:27.334 --> 01:27:28.669
Is that him?

1015
01:27:29.545 --> 01:27:31.380
Holy shit.

1016
01:27:51.275 --> 01:27:52.860
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?


1017
01:28:22.264 --> 01:28:25.893
"I grew up from a
seed, tough as a weed.

1018
01:28:25.976 --> 01:28:28.813
But in a mansion, in a slum,

1019
01:28:28.896 --> 01:28:30.815
I'll never know where I come from.

1020
01:28:31.690 --> 01:28:33.025
Do you know what I am?"

1021
01:28:33.109 --> 01:28:34.110
Any idea?

1022
01:28:34.652 --> 01:28:35.653
Yeah.

1023
01:28:37.071 --> 01:28:38.322
It's an orphan.

1024
01:28:47.206 --> 01:28:48.958
A mansion in a slum.

1025
01:28:50.501 --> 01:28:53.087
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?


1026
01:28:53.170 --> 01:28:54.880
It was part of the Wayne estate.

1027
01:28:55.506 --> 01:28:57.091
They donated it
after they built the tower.


1028
01:28:57.174 --> 01:28:58.008
Let's go.

1029
01:29:01.262 --> 01:29:03.723
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

1030
01:29:04.765 --> 01:29:06.142
You gonna untie me?

1031
01:29:06.225 --> 01:29:07.685
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?


1032
01:29:11.605 --> 01:29:12.606
Hey!

1033
01:29:14.066 --> 01:29:16.485
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1034
01:29:30.583 --> 01:29:32.752
No guns.

1035
01:29:34.211 --> 01:29:36.255
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

1036
01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:58.569
What's that?

1037
01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:10.998
Hey! Hey!

1038
01:30:17.463 --> 01:30:18.672
Dropheads.

1039
01:30:26.097 --> 01:30:27.723
What the hell is that?

1040
01:30:39.485 --> 01:30:41.862
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

1041
01:30:41.946 --> 01:30:43.239
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

1042
01:30:45.991 --> 01:30:48.035
<i>Thank you all. 
Thank you, uh...</i>

1043
01:30:48.452 --> 01:30:50.037
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

1044
01:30:51.789 --> 01:30:53.374
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

1045
01:30:54.667 --> 01:30:56.460
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

1046
01:30:57.670 --> 01:31:01.132
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>


1047
01:31:01.674 --> 01:31:03.467
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

1048
01:31:03.551 --> 01:31:06.387
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>


1049
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:09.807
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>


1050
01:31:10.349 --> 01:31:12.226
<i>Win or lose,</i>

1051
01:31:12.309 --> 01:31:15.104
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>


1052
01:31:15.563 --> 01:31:18.399
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>


1053
01:31:18.983 --> 01:31:23.029
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>


1054
01:31:23.112 --> 01:31:25.031
<i>who need it now,</i>

1055
01:31:25.114 --> 01:31:26.574
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

1056
01:31:26.657 --> 01:31:28.075
"Sins of the father."

1057
01:31:28.159 --> 01:31:30.619
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>


1058
01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.166
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

1059
01:31:39.045 --> 01:31:41.255
Shall be visited upon the son.

1060
01:31:43.257 --> 01:31:46.385
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

1061
01:31:50.973 --> 01:31:52.391
Hey!

1062
01:32:52.076 --> 01:32:54.620
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!


1063
01:32:54.704 --> 01:32:56.539
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!


1064
01:32:56.622 --> 01:32:58.249
Something terrible is gonna happen!

1065
01:32:58.916 --> 01:33:01.001
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1066
01:33:12.805 --> 01:33:14.557
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

1067
01:33:15.725 --> 01:33:17.393
I'm so sorry.

1068
01:33:18.853 --> 01:33:20.604
I've been trying to reach you.

1069
01:33:23.357 --> 01:33:25.025
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

1070
01:33:25.568 --> 01:33:29.321
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.


1071
01:33:52.053 --> 01:33:53.679
We've sedated him.

1072
01:33:53.763 --> 01:33:55.389
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

1073
01:33:56.265 --> 01:33:58.976
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.


1074
01:33:59.518 --> 01:34:01.270
Is there anyone else to notify?

1075
01:34:02.605 --> 01:34:04.023
Next of kin?

1076
01:34:09.153 --> 01:34:10.237
No.

1077
01:34:11.364 --> 01:34:12.990
It's just me.

1078
01:35:56.093 --> 01:35:57.344
Selina?

1079
01:36:03.976 --> 01:36:04.977
<i>Can you see me?</i>

1080
01:36:08.105 --> 01:36:10.524
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>


1081
01:36:11.400 --> 01:36:12.485
<i>Where can we go?</i>

1082
01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:33.089
Cat burglar pulling another score?

1083
01:36:34.173 --> 01:36:36.634
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.


1084
01:36:36.717 --> 01:36:39.178
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...


1085
01:36:39.845 --> 01:36:41.597
How could they do that to her?

1086
01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:43.641
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1087
01:36:43.724 --> 01:36:45.643
Her body was in his car.

1088
01:36:45.726 --> 01:36:48.604
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?


1089
01:36:48.687 --> 01:36:51.690
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."


1090
01:36:51.774 --> 01:36:53.317
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.


1091
01:36:53.401 --> 01:36:55.027
She didn't know any better.

1092
01:36:55.111 --> 01:36:56.445
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.


1093
01:36:56.529 --> 01:36:58.072
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1094
01:36:58.155 --> 01:36:59.657
It means your choices have consequences.

1095
01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:02.118
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1096
01:37:02.201 --> 01:37:04.912
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.


1097
01:37:04.995 --> 01:37:06.831
- Was it worth it?
- What?


1098
01:37:07.164 --> 01:37:09.333
Compromising yourself for money?

1099
01:37:10.710 --> 01:37:12.962
What did you have to do
to set up that score?


1100
01:37:14.588 --> 01:37:18.259
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?


1101
01:37:18.342 --> 01:37:19.677
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.


1102
01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.095
Falcone owes me that money.

1103
01:37:21.178 --> 01:37:22.930
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.


1104
01:37:23.013 --> 01:37:23.848
Oh, really? Why's that?

1105
01:37:23.931 --> 01:37:24.849
You know what? 
I can't even talk to you.

1106
01:37:24.932 --> 01:37:26.684
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone


1107
01:37:26.767 --> 01:37:27.768
would owe you anything.

1108
01:37:27.852 --> 01:37:30.187
Because he's my father!

1109
01:37:39.321 --> 01:37:42.116
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1110
01:37:43.617 --> 01:37:44.910
Just like Anni.

1111
01:37:47.079 --> 01:37:49.623
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.


1112
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:53.044
To the club?

1113
01:37:53.961 --> 01:37:54.962
Yeah.

1114
01:37:57.673 --> 01:38:00.551
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.


1115
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:02.762
Used to see him there.

1116
01:38:03.512 --> 01:38:05.514
He scared the shit out of me.

1117
01:38:07.475 --> 01:38:10.936
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.


1118
01:38:11.479 --> 01:38:15.316
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.


1119
01:38:18.694 --> 01:38:21.030
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.


1120
01:38:21.697 --> 01:38:23.199
Strangled.

1121
01:38:23.616 --> 01:38:27.078
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.


1122
01:38:28.954 --> 01:38:31.040
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,


1123
01:38:31.123 --> 01:38:33.292
and he didn't say a thing.

1124
01:38:35.127 --> 01:38:36.921
Couldn't even look at me.

1125
01:38:40.674 --> 01:38:42.426
He owes me that money.

1126
01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:45.638
I'm sorry.

1127
01:38:46.764 --> 01:38:47.932
For what I said.

1128
01:38:49.308 --> 01:38:50.726
Oh, it's all right.

1129
01:38:54.271 --> 01:38:56.357
You assume the worst in people.

1130
01:38:57.274 --> 01:38:58.651
Which, well...

1131
01:39:00.945 --> 01:39:02.863
maybe we're not so different after all.

1132
01:39:08.327 --> 01:39:10.079
Who are you under there?

1133
01:39:16.168 --> 01:39:18.045
What are you hiding?

1134
01:39:20.423 --> 01:39:22.258
Are you just...

1135
01:39:23.843 --> 01:39:25.553
hideously scarred?

1136
01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:28.681
Yeah.

1137
01:39:35.938 --> 01:39:37.356
Listen to me.

1138
01:39:38.899 --> 01:39:41.777
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.


1139
01:39:42.945 --> 01:39:47.616
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.


1140
01:39:48.242 --> 01:39:51.328
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1141
01:39:51.412 --> 01:39:52.663
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1142
01:39:52.747 --> 01:39:53.998
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1143
01:39:54.081 --> 01:39:56.125
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.


1144
01:39:56.208 --> 01:39:57.460
I think you'd be on his side.

1145
01:39:57.543 --> 01:39:59.170
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?


1146
01:39:59.253 --> 01:40:01.213
What, do you live in a cave?

1147
01:40:01.297 --> 01:40:03.382
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.


1148
01:40:04.467 --> 01:40:08.345
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,


1149
01:40:08.429 --> 01:40:09.638
will you help me?

1150
01:40:10.890 --> 01:40:12.183
Please.

1151
01:40:14.977 --> 01:40:16.896
Come on, Vengeance.

1152
01:40:19.356 --> 01:40:21.609
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?


1153
01:40:21.692 --> 01:40:23.319
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...


1154
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:34.413
I told you, baby.

1155
01:40:36.332 --> 01:40:38.918
I can take care of myself.

1156
01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:53.015
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>


1157
01:41:00.856 --> 01:41:04.443
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>


1158
01:41:04.568 --> 01:41:06.404
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

1159
01:41:06.612 --> 01:41:09.031
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>


1160
01:41:09.198 --> 01:41:10.658
<i>it's a passion.</i>

1161
01:41:11.367 --> 01:41:13.703
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

1162
01:41:14.912 --> 01:41:17.248
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

1163
01:41:17.331 --> 01:41:19.792
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

1164
01:41:19.875 --> 01:41:23.045
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

1165
01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:29.051
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>


1166
01:41:29.135 --> 01:41:32.805
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

1167
01:41:33.514 --> 01:41:35.057
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

1168
01:41:35.141 --> 01:41:37.643
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

1169
01:41:37.727 --> 01:41:39.353
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

1170
01:41:39.437 --> 01:41:45.025
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>


1171
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:49.780
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>


1172
01:41:49.864 --> 01:41:52.241
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

1173
01:41:53.075 --> 01:41:55.578
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>


1174
01:41:55.661 --> 01:41:59.582
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>


1175
01:41:59.707 --> 01:42:01.751
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

1176
01:42:02.251 --> 01:42:06.547
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>


1177
01:42:06.630 --> 01:42:09.216
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

1178
01:42:09.341 --> 01:42:12.386
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

1179
01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:18.225
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

1180
01:42:18.726 --> 01:42:21.103
<i>I hope you're listening, 
Bruce Wayne.</i>

1181
01:42:21.187 --> 01:42:23.564
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

1182
01:42:23.647 --> 01:42:27.109
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

1183
01:42:27.193 --> 01:42:29.987
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

1184
01:42:31.530 --> 01:42:33.366
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1185
01:42:39.121 --> 01:42:40.206
Do you know who I am?

1186
01:42:41.832 --> 01:42:42.958
You're Bruce Wayne.

1187
01:42:43.042 --> 01:42:44.919
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1188
01:42:55.679 --> 01:42:56.680
See?

1189
01:43:07.983 --> 01:43:10.611
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?


1190
01:43:11.362 --> 01:43:13.489
Must have made a fortune.

1191
01:43:13.948 --> 01:43:15.700
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?


1192
01:43:17.201 --> 01:43:19.662
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?


1193
01:43:19.745 --> 01:43:20.746
No, boss.

1194
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:23.165
$1,183.

1195
01:43:23.749 --> 01:43:25.710
You know why communism failed, right?

1196
01:43:25.793 --> 01:43:26.794
No, boss.

1197
01:43:28.713 --> 01:43:29.964
Austerity.

1198
01:43:32.216 --> 01:43:33.843
All right. All right.

1199
01:43:34.135 --> 01:43:36.512
Look at that. Perfect.

1200
01:43:36.595 --> 01:43:38.347
It's never gonna be that good again.

1201
01:43:40.558 --> 01:43:43.060
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1202
01:43:43.144 --> 01:43:44.311
What are you doing here?

1203
01:43:46.230 --> 01:43:48.065
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1204
01:43:48.983 --> 01:43:50.025
Come on.

1205
01:43:51.944 --> 01:43:53.154
See ya, champ.

1206
01:43:54.155 --> 01:43:55.406
Come on, sweetheart.

1207
01:43:57.366 --> 01:43:58.367
Have a seat.

1208
01:44:00.411 --> 01:44:02.204
I thought I might hear from you.

1209
01:44:03.372 --> 01:44:06.500
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...


1210
01:44:08.044 --> 01:44:09.837
stirring things up, huh?

1211
01:44:09.920 --> 01:44:11.630
- Is it true?
- What?


1212
01:44:12.923 --> 01:44:14.550
That reporter business?

1213
01:44:15.885 --> 01:44:17.094
What do you want to know here, kid?

1214
01:44:17.178 --> 01:44:19.972
Did you kill him? 
For my father?

1215
01:44:20.056 --> 01:44:22.808
Look, your father was in trouble.

1216
01:44:23.684 --> 01:44:25.478
This reporter had some dirt.

1217
01:44:25.561 --> 01:44:27.188
Some very...

1218
01:44:28.355 --> 01:44:32.109
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.


1219
01:44:32.193 --> 01:44:34.904
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.


1220
01:44:34.987 --> 01:44:36.447
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,


1221
01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:38.449
not right before the election.

1222
01:44:38.908 --> 01:44:41.202
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,


1223
01:44:41.285 --> 01:44:42.912
but he wasn't going for it.

1224
01:44:42.995 --> 01:44:46.165
So, he came to me.

1225
01:44:46.248 --> 01:44:48.626
Well, I never seen him like that.

1226
01:44:49.460 --> 01:44:51.295
He said, "Carmine,

1227
01:44:52.088 --> 01:44:56.801
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."


1228
01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:02.139
And when fear isn't enough...

1229
01:45:02.807 --> 01:45:04.642
Oof. Hmm.

1230
01:45:05.976 --> 01:45:09.313
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.


1231
01:45:10.314 --> 01:45:12.149
I handled it.

1232
01:45:13.859 --> 01:45:15.277
I know.

1233
01:45:15.361 --> 01:45:17.613
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1234
01:45:18.864 --> 01:45:20.700
But you'd be surprised

1235
01:45:20.783 --> 01:45:23.160
what even a good man like him

1236
01:45:23.244 --> 01:45:25.830
is capable of in the right situation.

1237
01:45:28.082 --> 01:45:29.542
Do me a favor.

1238
01:45:29.875 --> 01:45:31.919
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1239
01:45:32.628 --> 01:45:34.213
This reporter

1240
01:45:35.047 --> 01:45:36.632
was a lowlife.

1241
01:45:36.716 --> 01:45:38.175
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1242
01:45:39.802 --> 01:45:41.429
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.


1243
01:45:42.179 --> 01:45:45.433
He could never stand
your father and I had history.


1244
01:45:46.851 --> 01:45:50.354
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried


1245
01:45:50.438 --> 01:45:52.773
that your father would be in my pocket,

1246
01:45:53.524 --> 01:45:54.525
forever.

1247
01:45:55.192 --> 01:45:57.236
He would have done anything

1248
01:45:57.319 --> 01:45:59.488
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1249
01:45:59.572 --> 01:46:00.906
You understand?

1250
01:46:02.116 --> 01:46:06.662
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?


1251
01:46:06.746 --> 01:46:08.789
Do I know it for a fact?

1252
01:46:11.208 --> 01:46:13.294
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.


1253
01:46:14.670 --> 01:46:16.964
This is what you wanted, huh?

1254
01:46:17.048 --> 01:46:19.467
This little conversation here?

1255
01:46:21.886 --> 01:46:24.055
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1256
01:46:26.682 --> 01:46:28.809
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1257
01:47:38.212 --> 01:47:39.505
You lied to me...

1258
01:47:42.341 --> 01:47:43.968
my whole life.

1259
01:47:49.140 --> 01:47:51.183
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1260
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:57.565
He told me what
he did for my father.

1261
01:48:01.569 --> 01:48:03.070
About Salvatore Maroni.

1262
01:48:05.072 --> 01:48:07.783
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1263
01:48:07.867 --> 01:48:09.618
Had my father killed.

1264
01:48:12.079 --> 01:48:14.290
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1265
01:48:17.043 --> 01:48:21.589
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,


1266
01:48:21.672 --> 01:48:24.008
believing that he was a good man.

1267
01:48:24.091 --> 01:48:25.676
He was a good man.

1268
01:48:26.844 --> 01:48:28.554
You listen to me.

1269
01:48:28.637 --> 01:48:32.058
Your father was a good man.

1270
01:48:35.686 --> 01:48:37.605
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."


1271
01:48:37.688 --> 01:48:39.607
He had a man killed.

1272
01:48:39.690 --> 01:48:40.775
Why?

1273
01:48:41.942 --> 01:48:45.196
To protect his family image?

1274
01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:47.531
His political aspirations?

1275
01:48:47.615 --> 01:48:51.160
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.


1276
01:48:53.746 --> 01:48:55.289
He was protecting your mother.

1277
01:48:56.248 --> 01:48:59.794
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.


1278
01:48:59.877 --> 01:49:02.004
He cared about her,

1279
01:49:02.088 --> 01:49:03.381
and you,

1280
01:49:03.464 --> 01:49:06.384
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.


1281
01:49:06.467 --> 01:49:09.929
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.


1282
01:49:10.805 --> 01:49:14.141
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything


1283
01:49:14.225 --> 01:49:17.353
to finally have something on him
that he could use.


1284
01:49:17.436 --> 01:49:19.271
That's who Falcone is.

1285
01:49:21.524 --> 01:49:23.734
And that was your father's mistake.

1286
01:49:23.818 --> 01:49:25.861
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,


1287
01:49:25.945 --> 01:49:28.698
your father was distraught.

1288
01:49:29.573 --> 01:49:32.785
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,


1289
01:49:32.868 --> 01:49:35.037
that he would confess everything.

1290
01:49:36.539 --> 01:49:38.541
And that night,

1291
01:49:38.624 --> 01:49:42.545
your father and your mother were killed.

1292
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:49.802
It was Falcone?

1293
01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:57.977
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1294
01:50:02.690 --> 01:50:06.235
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street


1295
01:50:06.318 --> 01:50:09.071
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.


1296
01:50:09.155 --> 01:50:14.368
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...


1297
01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:19.999
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?


1298
01:50:20.666 --> 01:50:22.460
I know you always blamed yourself.

1299
01:50:22.543 --> 01:50:25.087
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1300
01:50:27.256 --> 01:50:29.550
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1301
01:50:30.968 --> 01:50:33.345
but I didn't know how to help.

1302
01:50:33.429 --> 01:50:35.931
I could teach you how to fight,

1303
01:50:37.308 --> 01:50:39.977
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.


1304
01:50:40.061 --> 01:50:41.896
You needed a father.

1305
01:50:43.856 --> 01:50:46.275
And all you had was me.

1306
01:50:48.652 --> 01:50:49.862
I'm sorry.

1307
01:50:51.614 --> 01:50:53.532
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1308
01:51:00.331 --> 01:51:01.415
God.

1309
01:51:04.460 --> 01:51:08.881
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.


1310
01:51:11.592 --> 01:51:13.719
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1311
01:51:20.142 --> 01:51:21.394
I mean,

1312
01:51:22.603 --> 01:51:24.730
I'm not afraid to die.

1313
01:51:26.482 --> 01:51:28.859
I realize now there's something

1314
01:51:29.985 --> 01:51:31.862
I haven't got past.

1315
01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:34.532
This fear...

1316
01:51:36.992 --> 01:51:39.954
of ever going through any of that again.

1317
01:51:44.208 --> 01:51:46.419
Of losing somebody I care about.

1318
01:52:37.011 --> 01:52:37.970
Hey.

1319
01:52:38.054 --> 01:52:40.806
I saw the signal. 
That's not you?

1320
01:52:40.890 --> 01:52:42.808
I thought it was you.

1321
01:52:55.738 --> 01:52:57.281
- I found him!
- I see that.


1322
01:52:57.365 --> 01:52:58.866
He had my shit and my phone.

1323
01:52:58.949 --> 01:53:00.159
She left a message
the night they took her.


1324
01:53:00.242 --> 01:53:01.160
She called me...

1325
01:53:01.243 --> 01:53:02.953
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1326
01:53:03.037 --> 01:53:04.330
She got my gun!

1327
01:53:05.664 --> 01:53:07.375
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.


1328
01:53:08.918 --> 01:53:11.462
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!


1329
01:53:16.050 --> 01:53:18.135
Here. Listen.

1330
01:53:20.096 --> 01:53:21.764
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

1331
01:53:21.889 --> 01:53:24.058
<i>Where you going? 
Come back here!</i>

1332
01:53:24.141 --> 01:53:26.227
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>


1333
01:53:26.310 --> 01:53:27.645
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

1334
01:53:27.728 --> 01:53:29.438
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

1335
01:53:29.522 --> 01:53:30.564
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

1336
01:53:30.648 --> 01:53:31.941
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

1337
01:53:32.024 --> 01:53:34.694
<i>Hey, don't be scared. 
Come here.</i>

1338
01:53:36.570 --> 01:53:38.614
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

1339
01:53:39.323 --> 01:53:41.867
- <i>What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
- <i>No, nothing. He...</i>


1340
01:53:41.951 --> 01:53:44.870
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>


1341
01:53:44.954 --> 01:53:47.665
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

1342
01:53:48.207 --> 01:53:50.209
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>


1343
01:53:50.918 --> 01:53:53.796
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>


1344
01:53:53.879 --> 01:53:56.590
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>


1345
01:53:56.674 --> 01:53:58.801
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>


1346
01:53:58.884 --> 01:54:02.012
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>


1347
01:54:02.847 --> 01:54:05.391
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

1348
01:54:06.475 --> 01:54:07.810
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

1349
01:54:08.602 --> 01:54:12.148
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>


1350
01:54:12.648 --> 01:54:13.858
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1351
01:54:13.941 --> 01:54:15.901
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1352
01:54:15.985 --> 01:54:17.278
<i>The deal.</i>

1353
01:54:17.361 --> 01:54:22.283
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>


1354
01:54:22.366 --> 01:54:25.077
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1355
01:54:25.161 --> 01:54:27.538
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1356
01:54:27.621 --> 01:54:28.748
<i>Right.</i>

1357
01:54:29.498 --> 01:54:30.875
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1358
01:54:31.834 --> 01:54:34.003
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

1359
01:54:41.677 --> 01:54:43.012
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

1360
01:54:43.095 --> 01:54:44.638
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1361
01:54:44.722 --> 01:54:47.767
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1362
01:54:56.984 --> 01:54:58.277
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

1363
01:55:03.032 --> 01:55:04.825
A falcon has wings too.

1364
01:55:05.159 --> 01:55:06.994
Falcone is the rat?

1365
01:55:17.963 --> 01:55:21.133
Falcone works for you guys?

1366
01:55:21.801 --> 01:55:24.345
The mayor? The DA?

1367
01:55:27.348 --> 01:55:28.432
No.

1368
01:55:31.519 --> 01:55:32.812
We work for him.

1369
01:55:33.813 --> 01:55:35.064
Everybody does.

1370
01:55:35.147 --> 01:55:36.148
How?

1371
01:55:36.232 --> 01:55:37.817
Through Renewal.

1372
01:55:38.609 --> 01:55:39.985
Renewal is everything.

1373
01:55:40.069 --> 01:55:41.404
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.


1374
01:55:41.987 --> 01:55:45.700
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.


1375
01:55:45.783 --> 01:55:49.370
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.


1376
01:55:49.453 --> 01:55:52.832
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.


1377
01:55:52.915 --> 01:55:55.000
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.


1378
01:55:55.084 --> 01:55:56.794
Everybody got a piece.

1379
01:55:56.877 --> 01:55:58.713
But Falcone wanted more.

1380
01:56:00.506 --> 01:56:03.718
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.


1381
01:56:05.136 --> 01:56:07.471
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1382
01:56:07.847 --> 01:56:10.558
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,


1383
01:56:10.641 --> 01:56:13.102
then install them all as his puppets.

1384
01:56:13.185 --> 01:56:15.730
You think this goddamn election matters?

1385
01:56:17.356 --> 01:56:19.275
Falcone's the mayor.

1386
01:56:20.234 --> 01:56:22.737
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.


1387
01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:24.196
Come on, Vengeance.

1388
01:56:24.905 --> 01:56:26.741
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1389
01:56:27.450 --> 01:56:29.076
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!


1390
01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:29.994
No!

1391
01:56:31.454 --> 01:56:32.663
We'll get him.

1392
01:56:33.330 --> 01:56:35.207
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!


1393
01:56:35.291 --> 01:56:36.417
He owns the city!

1394
01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:37.752
Cross that line...

1395
01:56:38.544 --> 01:56:39.837
you'll become just like him.

1396
01:56:40.546 --> 01:56:42.089
Listen to me.

1397
01:56:42.173 --> 01:56:44.050
Don't throw your life away.

1398
01:56:50.598 --> 01:56:51.974
Don't worry, honey.

1399
01:56:55.061 --> 01:56:56.520
I got nine of 'em.

1400
01:56:56.645 --> 01:56:58.606
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1401
01:56:59.899 --> 01:57:01.192
Oh, God!

1402
01:57:10.493 --> 01:57:11.619
She won't get out of there alive.

1403
01:57:11.786 --> 01:57:14.372
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.


1404
01:57:14.455 --> 01:57:15.456
I have to stop her.

1405
01:57:15.623 --> 01:57:16.582
Don't you mean "we"?

1406
01:57:17.917 --> 01:57:19.460
I gotta do this my way.

1407
01:57:19.794 --> 01:57:20.795
And then what?

1408
01:57:21.670 --> 01:57:23.047
We do what Riddler said.

1409
01:57:23.881 --> 01:57:25.508
Bring the rat into the light.

1410
01:58:01.460 --> 01:58:03.504
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?


1411
01:58:03.587 --> 01:58:05.047
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1412
01:58:05.673 --> 01:58:07.007
Tell him it's about Annika.

1413
01:58:10.261 --> 01:58:11.595
Hey!

1414
01:58:12.430 --> 01:58:13.848
Look who it is, huh?

1415
01:58:13.931 --> 01:58:16.350
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.


1416
01:58:16.434 --> 01:58:18.436
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?


1417
01:58:18.602 --> 01:58:20.062
Absolutely.

1418
01:58:21.814 --> 01:58:22.815
Alone?

1419
01:58:39.373 --> 01:58:40.458
Hey!

1420
01:58:51.010 --> 01:58:52.219
I'm just so worried.

1421
01:58:52.303 --> 01:58:53.929
I don't know where she is.

1422
01:58:55.681 --> 01:58:59.060
And I know
that you're a very important man.


1423
01:58:59.143 --> 01:59:02.563
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...


1424
01:59:04.065 --> 01:59:06.442
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...


1425
01:59:07.902 --> 01:59:09.028
I'm sorry.

1426
01:59:09.236 --> 01:59:10.321
It's okay.

1427
01:59:10.404 --> 01:59:12.531
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.


1428
01:59:12.698 --> 01:59:15.576
No, that's okay, 
I have a tissue.

1429
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:20.748
Mr. Falcone?

1430
01:59:20.831 --> 01:59:22.291
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1431
01:59:22.375 --> 01:59:25.294
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.


1432
01:59:27.671 --> 01:59:29.173
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1433
01:59:29.256 --> 01:59:30.674
I'll be right back.

1434
01:59:45.981 --> 01:59:47.066
Holy shit.

1435
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:48.818
<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

02:00:01.080 --> 02:00:02.623
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

1441
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:04.458
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

1442
02:00:04.542 --> 02:00:06.043
<i>The deal.</i>

1443
02:00:06.127 --> 02:00:10.923

1444

<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

1445
02:00:14.009 --> 02:00:16.554
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

1446
02:00:16.637 --> 02:00:17.638
<i>Right.</i>

1447
02:00:18.514 --> 02:00:19.724

1448
02:00:19.807 --> 02:00:21.016

02:00:30.735 --> 02:00:31.986
<i>as a mafia informant...</i>

1451
02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:33.821
Hey, Dad.

1452
02:00:34.864 --> 02:00:35.865
What?

1453
02:00:36.323 --> 02:00:38.367
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1454
02:00:39.994 --> 02:00:41.454
You remember her?

1455
02:00:43.497 --> 02:00:44.540
Yeah.

1456
02:00:48.836 --> 02:00:49.920
Just put down the gun, honey.

1457
02:00:50.004 --> 02:00:51.088
This is for my mother.

1458
02:01:48.354 --> 02:01:49.522
I see him!

1459
02:02:33.566 --> 02:02:35.317
You don't think this hurts me?

1460
02:02:39.905 --> 02:02:42.199
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1461
02:02:58.591 --> 02:03:00.426
You made me do this.

1462
02:03:01.844 --> 02:03:03.637
Just like your mother.

1463
02:03:09.643 --> 02:03:10.978
He has to pay!

1464
02:03:14.899 --> 02:03:16.025
You don't have to pay with him.

1465
02:03:19.653 --> 02:03:21.155
You paid enough.

1466
02:03:55.731 --> 02:03:56.857
Jesus.

1467
02:03:56.941 --> 02:03:59.652
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?


1468
02:03:59.735 --> 02:04:02.822
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?


1469
02:04:02.905 --> 02:04:04.156
I'm gonna start crying,

1470
02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:06.742
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?


1471
02:04:06.826 --> 02:04:08.452
Let me tell you something.

1472
02:04:08.536 --> 02:04:10.246
Whatever I know,

1473
02:04:10.329 --> 02:04:12.206
whatever I've done,

1474
02:04:12.289 --> 02:04:16.627
it's all going with me to my grave.

1475
02:04:27.179 --> 02:04:29.140
What, are you with Zorro over here?

1476
02:04:30.766 --> 02:04:33.060
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?


1477
02:04:40.985 --> 02:04:43.320
I guess we don't all work for you.

1478
02:04:52.329 --> 02:04:53.873
You have the right to remain silent.

1479
02:04:54.707 --> 02:04:58.210
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.


1480
02:04:58.294 --> 02:04:59.628
You have the right to an attorney.

1481
02:04:59.712 --> 02:05:00.880
If you cannot afford one,

1482
02:05:00.963 --> 02:05:02.757
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.


1483
02:05:02.840 --> 02:05:04.550
Do you understand these rights?

1484
02:05:06.052 --> 02:05:07.636
Do you understand?

1485
02:05:09.597 --> 02:05:10.681
Yeah.

1486
02:05:10.765 --> 02:05:12.850
I'll see you when I walk out.

1487
02:05:12.933 --> 02:05:13.934
With these rights in mind,

1488
02:05:14.018 --> 02:05:15.311
is there anything else
you wish to tell...


1489
02:05:15.394 --> 02:05:16.645
Goddamn rat.

1490
02:05:18.606 --> 02:05:19.940
What'd you say?

1491
02:05:20.024 --> 02:05:21.776
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.

1492
02:05:22.902 --> 02:05:24.153
Probably be your last.

1493
02:05:24.403 --> 02:05:27.448
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

1494
02:05:27.531 --> 02:05:28.616
Maybe I am.

1495
02:05:28.699 --> 02:05:29.909
Really, Oz?

1496
02:05:29.992 --> 02:05:34.705
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.


1497
02:05:34.789 --> 02:05:35.873
I'll spray paint your ass!

1498
02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.045
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

1499
02:05:41.504 --> 02:05:43.506
I didn't shoot! 
I didn't shoot!

1500
02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:46.300
Get your hands off of me!

1501
02:06:05.861 --> 02:06:07.863
"Bring him into the light.

1502
02:06:11.450 --> 02:06:13.411
And you'll find where I'm at."

1503
02:06:13.494 --> 02:06:14.578
There!

1504
02:06:14.662 --> 02:06:16.497
The shots came from up there!

1505
02:06:18.082 --> 02:06:19.083
It's Riddler.

1506
02:06:21.168 --> 02:06:22.336
Gage, on me.

1507
02:06:22.420 --> 02:06:25.131
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!


1508
02:07:39.330 --> 02:07:40.539
He's gone.

1509
02:07:50.341 --> 02:07:52.301
He's been here this whole time.

1510
02:07:52.385 --> 02:07:54.720
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?


1511
02:07:54.804 --> 02:07:55.930
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

1512
02:07:56.013 --> 02:07:58.682
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>


1513
02:07:58.766 --> 02:08:01.227
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

1514
02:08:01.310 --> 02:08:04.230
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>


1515
02:08:19.745 --> 02:08:21.831
Police! Hands up!

1516
02:08:24.875 --> 02:08:28.379
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.


1517
02:08:47.523 --> 02:08:49.442
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1518
02:08:52.403 --> 02:08:53.696
Stay still!

1519
02:08:53.779 --> 02:08:54.780
Now!

1520
02:09:23.434 --> 02:09:25.227
Which one is you?

1521
02:09:25.311 --> 02:09:26.812
You tell me.

1522
02:09:27.646 --> 02:09:29.106
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1523
02:09:32.193 --> 02:09:33.944
Get that son of
a bitch out of here!

1524
02:09:48.459 --> 02:09:51.379
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>


1525

1526
02:09:54.131 --> 02:09:56.717

1527
02:09:56.801 --> 02:09:57.843
Hey.

1528
02:10:22.284 --> 02:10:23.994
What are all these diaries?

1529
02:10:24.078 --> 02:10:26.497
They're ledgers. 
He's got thousands.

1530
02:10:26.580 --> 02:10:30.126
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.


1531
02:10:30.209 --> 02:10:31.752
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1532
02:10:31.836 --> 02:10:34.130
Edward Nashton. 
Works at KTMJ.

1533
02:10:34.213 --> 02:10:36.048
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?


1534
02:10:36.132 --> 02:10:38.551
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?


1535
02:10:38.634 --> 02:10:40.386
What about chain of evidence?

1536
02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:42.430
You should see this.

1537
02:10:48.394 --> 02:10:49.895
He's wearing gloves.

1538
02:10:51.355 --> 02:10:53.607
"Friday, July 16th.

1539
02:10:53.691 --> 02:10:57.403
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,


1540
02:10:57.737 --> 02:11:00.781
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1541
02:11:00.865 --> 02:11:02.283
But then, today, I saw it.

1542
02:11:02.366 --> 02:11:06.495
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.


1543
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:09.623
'Renewal.'

1544
02:11:09.707 --> 02:11:14.128
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.


1545
02:11:14.211 --> 02:11:17.339
One look inside,
and finally I understood.


1546
02:11:17.423 --> 02:11:20.760
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.


1547
02:11:20.843 --> 02:11:23.304
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1548
02:11:23.387 --> 02:11:26.390
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."


1549
02:11:27.516 --> 02:11:29.351
"If you want people to understand,

1550
02:11:29.435 --> 02:11:31.270
really understand,

1551
02:11:31.353 --> 02:11:33.647
you can't just give them the answers.

1552
02:11:33.731 --> 02:11:35.191
You have to confront them,

1553
02:11:35.274 --> 02:11:37.693
torture them
with the horrifying questions,


1554
02:11:37.777 --> 02:11:39.945
just like they tortured me.

1555
02:11:40.029 --> 02:11:42.823
I know now what I must become."

1556
02:11:45.785 --> 02:11:47.119
Jesus.

1557
02:11:53.209 --> 02:11:55.169
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1558
02:11:55.711 --> 02:11:57.213
This one's not a rat.

1559
02:12:13.854 --> 02:12:14.980
What is that?

1560
02:12:46.595 --> 02:12:47.805
Some kind of pry tool?

1561
02:12:47.888 --> 02:12:49.265
Is it a chisel?

1562
02:12:49.348 --> 02:12:50.808
It's a murder weapon.

1563
02:12:50.891 --> 02:12:52.268
He killed Mitchell with it.

1564
02:12:52.935 --> 02:12:55.813
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.


1565
02:13:04.405 --> 02:13:06.407
"My confession"?

1566
02:13:06.490 --> 02:13:09.368
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.


1567
02:13:09.452 --> 02:13:10.828
This isn't over.

1568
02:13:10.911 --> 02:13:13.330
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.


1569
02:13:13.748 --> 02:13:15.958
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.


1570
02:13:24.050 --> 02:13:26.260
His final post was last night.

1571
02:13:26.343 --> 02:13:29.555
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.


1572
02:13:29.638 --> 02:13:32.641
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.


1573
02:13:32.767 --> 02:13:36.187
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1574
02:13:47.531 --> 02:13:50.076
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.


1575
02:13:51.702 --> 02:13:53.412
"The Truth Unmasked."

1576
02:13:54.246 --> 02:13:55.873
I think I'm his last target.

1577
02:13:58.459 --> 02:13:59.543
You?

1578
02:13:59.919 --> 02:14:01.962
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1579
02:14:02.505 --> 02:14:03.881
What is?

1580
02:14:04.340 --> 02:14:05.758
The Batman.

1581
02:14:11.138 --> 02:14:12.306
Yeah?

1582
02:14:23.609 --> 02:14:24.819
Right.

1583
02:14:27.697 --> 02:14:31.659
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

1584
02:14:39.125 --> 02:14:40.626
You're a good cop.

1585
02:15:05.234 --> 02:15:07.611
<i>I told you I'd see you in hell.</i>

1586
02:15:08.362 --> 02:15:10.197
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

1587
02:15:10.281 --> 02:15:11.824
"Want"?

1588
02:15:12.408 --> 02:15:16.037
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>


1589
02:15:17.246 --> 02:15:18.581
<i>For this moment.</i>

1590
02:15:19.623 --> 02:15:22.626
I've been invisible my whole life.

1591
02:15:23.711 --> 02:15:26.338
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

1592
02:15:27.882 --> 02:15:30.301
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

1593
02:15:30.384 --> 02:15:32.219
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

1594
02:15:42.605 --> 02:15:44.565
<i>Bruce...</i>

1595
02:15:47.443 --> 02:15:49.278
<i>Wayne.</i>

1596
02:15:51.655 --> 02:15:55.409
Bruce...

1597
02:15:56.827 --> 02:15:59.705
<i>Wayne.</i>

1598
02:16:10.966 --> 02:16:13.386
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

1599
02:16:15.971 --> 02:16:19.350
<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>


1600
02:16:19.433 --> 02:16:21.811
<i>made all those promises.</i>

1601
02:16:24.271 --> 02:16:28.526
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>


1602
02:16:29.068 --> 02:16:32.613
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>


1603
02:16:32.697 --> 02:16:36.367
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

1604
02:16:36.951 --> 02:16:38.494
<i>Orphan.</i>

1605
02:16:44.166 --> 02:16:49.296
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>


1606
02:16:50.589 --> 02:16:55.219
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>


1607
02:16:55.886 --> 02:16:57.430
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

1608
02:17:00.057 --> 02:17:02.727
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1609
02:17:03.102 --> 02:17:05.688
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

1610
02:17:06.981 --> 02:17:11.027
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>


1611
02:17:12.737 --> 02:17:17.408
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>


1612
02:17:18.576 --> 02:17:21.746
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

1613
02:17:21.829 --> 02:17:24.123
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

1614
02:17:25.416 --> 02:17:28.002
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

1615
02:17:30.921 --> 02:17:34.091
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>


1616
02:17:34.175 --> 02:17:37.094
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>


1617
02:17:37.178 --> 02:17:38.179
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

1618
02:17:39.638 --> 02:17:41.682
<i>Bruce...</i>

1619
02:17:42.725 --> 02:17:44.643
<i>Wayne.</i>

1620
02:17:48.314 --> 02:17:51.400
<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

1621
02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:57.948
<i>But we got the
rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

1622
02:17:59.408 --> 02:18:03.287
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

1623
02:18:06.457 --> 02:18:07.625
<i>God.</i>

1624
02:18:08.626 --> 02:18:09.919
<i>Look at you.</i>

1625
02:18:11.587 --> 02:18:14.048
Your mask is amazing.

1626
02:18:14.131 --> 02:18:17.051
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1627
02:18:17.134 --> 02:18:18.219
Ain't it funny?

1628
02:18:18.302 --> 02:18:22.723
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>


1629
02:18:24.183 --> 02:18:26.227
<i>You and I both know</i>

1630
02:18:27.186 --> 02:18:29.688
I'm looking at the real you right now.

1631
02:18:29.772 --> 02:18:33.401
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.


1632
02:18:33.484 --> 02:18:35.027
<i>No shame,</i>

1633
02:18:35.945 --> 02:18:36.946
<i>no limits.</i>

1634
02:18:37.029 --> 02:18:38.698
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

1635
02:18:39.573 --> 02:18:40.574
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1636
02:18:40.658 --> 02:18:42.368
<i>All those cards.</i>

1637
02:18:42.451 --> 02:18:43.661
<i>I told you,</i>

1638
02:18:44.370 --> 02:18:46.288
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>


1639
02:18:46.372 --> 02:18:48.582
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.


1640
02:18:48.666 --> 02:18:50.126
<i>What did we just do?</i>

1641
02:18:50.209 --> 02:18:52.211
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>


1642
02:18:52.294 --> 02:18:53.462
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

1643
02:18:53.546 --> 02:18:54.547
<i>We're not a team.</i>

1644
02:18:54.630 --> 02:18:57.133
I never could have
gotten him out of there.


1645
02:18:57.216 --> 02:18:59.635
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>


1646
02:18:59.719 --> 02:19:02.888
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>


1647
02:19:02.972 --> 02:19:04.598
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.


1648
02:19:04.682 --> 02:19:05.891
You gave me that.

1649
02:19:05.975 --> 02:19:07.101
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

1650
02:19:07.184 --> 02:19:09.770
You showed me what was possible.

1651
02:19:09.854 --> 02:19:14.734
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>


1652
02:19:14.817 --> 02:19:16.360
<i>You inspired me.</i>

1653
02:19:16.444 --> 02:19:17.945
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

1654
02:19:19.071 --> 02:19:20.156
<i>What?</i>

1655
02:19:20.239 --> 02:19:22.408
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>


1656
02:19:22.491 --> 02:19:23.868
<i>How can you say that?</i>

1657
02:19:23.951 --> 02:19:25.453
You think you'll be remembered?

1658
02:19:25.536 --> 02:19:27.204
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

1659
02:19:27.705 --> 02:19:29.457
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>


1660
02:19:29.540 --> 02:19:31.208
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.


1661
02:19:31.292 --> 02:19:32.334
<i>No, no!</i>

1662
02:19:32.418 --> 02:19:33.335
<i>A nobody!</i>

1663
02:19:35.129 --> 02:19:36.922
<i>No!</i>

1664
02:19:38.841 --> 02:19:41.218
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1665
02:19:41.469 --> 02:19:44.055
<i>This is not how
this was supposed to go!</i>

1666
02:19:45.014 --> 02:19:48.642
<i>Ahhh!</i>

1667
02:19:48.726 --> 02:19:51.353
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

1668
02:19:52.354 --> 02:19:54.356
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

1669
02:19:54.732 --> 02:19:58.027
We could watch the whole thing together.

1670
02:19:58.110 --> 02:19:59.111
<i>Watch what?</i>

1671
02:19:59.195 --> 02:20:00.946
<i>Everything!</i>

1672
02:20:09.288 --> 02:20:10.956
<i>It was all there.</i>

1673
02:20:13.125 --> 02:20:15.461
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

1674
02:20:19.757 --> 02:20:23.677
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>


1675
02:20:25.721 --> 02:20:27.807
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

1676
02:20:28.265 --> 02:20:29.517
<i>What have you done?</i>

1677
02:20:30.226 --> 02:20:35.106
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

1678
02:20:37.942 --> 02:20:39.777
<i>You.</i>

1679
02:20:41.445 --> 02:20:43.572
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>


1680
02:20:44.907 --> 02:20:46.450
<i>What have you done?</i>

1681
02:20:47.993 --> 02:20:53.833
<i>Ave Maria</i>

1682
02:20:54.250 --> 02:20:56.127

What are you doing in here?

1689
02:22:08.115 --> 02:22:10.701
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.


1690

You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1745
02:26:53.984 --> 02:26:57.780
<i>We'll give them real, real change now.</i>

1746
02:26:57.863 --> 02:27:02.868
<i>We've spent our lives in this
wretched place, suffering!</i>


1747
02:27:03.327 --> 02:27:05.830
<i>Wondering, "Why us?"</i>

1748
02:27:05.913 --> 02:27:09.041
<i>Now they will spend
their last moments wondering,</i>


1749
02:27:09.125 --> 02:27:11.293
<i>why them?</i>

1750
02:27:11.377 --> 02:27:13.421
I can't get through! 
The lines are down.

1751
02:27:19.051 --> 02:27:21.220
Hey, hey, hey! 
Road's closed!

1752
02:27:21.804 --> 02:27:23.431
I'm just trying to
get out of town, man!

1753
02:27:23.514 --> 02:27:26.392
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.


1754
02:27:26.475 --> 02:27:28.436
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.


1755
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:39.739
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.


1756
02:27:39.822 --> 02:27:41.323
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.


1757
02:27:41.407 --> 02:27:43.242
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1758
02:27:43.325 --> 02:27:44.577
We got an active situation.

1759
02:27:44.702 --> 02:27:45.995
We need to sweep the building
for explosives


1760
02:27:46.078 --> 02:27:47.288
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.


1761
02:27:47.371 --> 02:27:48.289
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.


1762
02:27:48.372 --> 02:27:49.206
Come!

1763
02:28:25.242 --> 02:28:26.660
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.


1764
02:28:26.744 --> 02:28:27.620
...we're gonna have huge problems.

1765
02:28:27.703 --> 02:28:29.080
The water's already started to breach.

1766
02:28:29.163 --> 02:28:30.706
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.


1767
02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:33.000
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.


1768
02:28:33.084 --> 02:28:34.919
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.


1769
02:28:35.002 --> 02:28:37.338
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.


1770
02:28:37.421 --> 02:28:39.673
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Re√°l.


1771
02:28:39.757 --> 02:28:42.009
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.


1772
02:28:42.093 --> 02:28:43.928
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.


1773
02:28:44.011 --> 02:28:47.014
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.


1774
02:28:47.098 --> 02:28:48.599
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...


1775
02:28:53.771 --> 02:28:57.233
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.


1776
02:28:57.316 --> 02:28:59.610
Please! I just need your attention!

1777
02:29:15.501 --> 02:29:16.627
You're okay!

1778
02:30:47.551 --> 02:30:50.179
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1779
02:30:50.262 --> 02:30:51.472
Follow me, sir.

1780
02:33:01.477 --> 02:33:02.978
No, no. It's okay.

1781
02:33:03.062 --> 02:33:04.105
It's okay.

1782
02:33:05.272 --> 02:33:06.315
It's okay.

1783
02:33:07.942 --> 02:33:10.069
It's done now. It's done.

1784
02:33:12.780 --> 02:33:14.115
It's over.

1785
02:34:09.962 --> 02:34:13.424
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1786
02:34:14.133 --> 02:34:16.469
Take it easy. Easy.

1787
02:34:45.039 --> 02:34:46.165
Jesus.

1788
02:34:56.008 --> 02:34:57.676
Who the hell are you?

1789
02:35:01.889 --> 02:35:02.890
Me?

1790
02:35:06.060 --> 02:35:07.478
I'm Vengeance.

1791
02:38:39.940 --> 02:38:42.234
<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

1792
02:38:45.446 --> 02:38:47.323
<i>The city is underwater.</i>

1793
02:38:49.658 --> 02:38:51.410
<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

1794
02:38:53.704 --> 02:38:55.706
<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

1795
02:38:56.624 --> 02:38:58.250
<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

1796
02:39:01.462 --> 02:39:05.174
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

1797
02:39:05.257 --> 02:39:07.802
<i>in the parts of the city
no one can get to.</i>


1798
02:39:08.969 --> 02:39:12.681
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>


1799
02:39:15.643 --> 02:39:18.771
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>


1800
02:39:20.147 --> 02:39:21.524
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

1801
02:39:22.149 --> 02:39:23.609
But not just our city.

1802
02:39:24.318 --> 02:39:28.531
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,


1803
02:39:28.614 --> 02:39:30.700
in our elected officials,

1804
02:39:30.783 --> 02:39:32.076
in each other.

1805
02:39:32.868 --> 02:39:36.205
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.


1806
02:39:40.543 --> 02:39:42.211
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

1807
02:39:43.671 --> 02:39:45.840
<i>I have had an effect here...</i>

1808
02:39:47.925 --> 02:39:49.844
<i>but not the one I intended.</i>

1809
02:39:52.221 --> 02:39:55.266
<i>Vengeance won't change the past,</i>

1810
02:39:56.600 --> 02:39:58.978
<i>mine or anyone else's.</i>

1811
02:40:01.397 --> 02:40:03.441
<i>I have to become more.</i>

1812
02:40:06.527 --> 02:40:08.154
<i>People need hope.</i>

1813
02:40:09.363 --> 02:40:11.574
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

1814
02:40:15.369 --> 02:40:17.038
<i>The city's angry,</i>

1815
02:40:17.955 --> 02:40:19.331
<i>scarred,</i>

1816
02:40:20.249 --> 02:40:21.500
<i>like me.</i>

1817
02:40:23.627 --> 02:40:25.713
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

1818
02:40:27.089 --> 02:40:29.800
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>


1819
02:40:31.427 --> 02:40:33.179
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

1820
02:40:34.680 --> 02:40:36.557
<i>they can transform us.</i>

1821
02:40:38.434 --> 02:40:40.352
<i>They can give us the power</i>

1822
02:40:41.312 --> 02:40:42.813
<i>to endure...</i>

1823
02:40:44.190 --> 02:40:46.317
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

1824
02:40:49.236 --> 02:40:51.405
<i>We are live. 
As you can see,</i>

1825
02:40:51.489 --> 02:40:54.283
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>


1826
02:40:54.367 --> 02:40:55.951
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

1827
02:40:56.035 --> 02:40:57.661
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

1828
02:40:57.745 --> 02:41:00.748
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>


1829
02:41:00.831 --> 02:41:03.376
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

1830
02:41:03.459 --> 02:41:05.795
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>


1831
02:41:05.878 --> 02:41:08.339
Isn't that just terrible?

1832
02:41:09.715 --> 02:41:11.634
Him...

1833
02:41:11.717 --> 02:41:14.595
raining on your parade like that?

1834
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:22.311
What is it they say?

1835
02:41:23.479 --> 02:41:25.648
"One day you're on top,

1836
02:41:27.191 --> 02:41:28.859
the next...

1837
02:41:30.236 --> 02:41:32.154
you're a clown."

1838
02:41:34.532 --> 02:41:35.700
Well,

1839
02:41:37.493 --> 02:41:40.329
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.


1840
02:41:42.623 --> 02:41:45.292
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1841
02:41:46.585 --> 02:41:48.421
You did so well.

1842
02:41:52.925 --> 02:41:53.926
And you know,

1843
02:41:55.594 --> 02:41:58.806
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1844
02:42:08.858 --> 02:42:10.234
Who are you?

1845
02:42:10.776 --> 02:42:13.195
Well, that's the question,

1846
02:42:14.447 --> 02:42:15.614
isn't it?

1847
02:42:18.534 --> 02:42:20.911
Riddle me this...

1848
02:42:23.372 --> 02:42:25.499
"The less of them you have,

1849
02:42:26.250 --> 02:42:30.087
the more one is worth."

1850
02:42:35.509 --> 02:42:37.261
A friend.

1851
02:43:03.496 --> 02:43:04.497
You're leaving.

1852
02:43:05.414 --> 02:43:06.499
Jesus.

1853
02:43:08.250 --> 02:43:09.835
Don't you ever just say hello?

1854
02:43:14.924 --> 02:43:16.342
Where will you go?

1855
02:43:17.843 --> 02:43:20.262
I don't know. Upstate.

1856
02:43:20.679 --> 02:43:22.390
Bludhaven, maybe.

1857
02:43:23.265 --> 02:43:24.266
Why?

1858
02:43:25.476 --> 02:43:26.685
You asking me to stay?

1859
02:43:33.734 --> 02:43:35.861
You know this place
is never gonna change.


1860
02:43:36.278 --> 02:43:38.614
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.


1861
02:43:38.698 --> 02:43:40.616
There's gonna be a power grab.

1862
02:43:42.243 --> 02:43:43.369
It'll be bloody.

1863
02:43:43.994 --> 02:43:45.204
I know.

1864
02:43:46.747 --> 02:43:47.832
But the city can change.

1865
02:43:47.915 --> 02:43:49.166
It won't.

1866
02:43:50.292 --> 02:43:51.293
I have to try.

1867
02:43:51.377 --> 02:43:53.170
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.


1868
02:43:55.464 --> 02:43:56.590
Listen.

1869
02:43:59.009 --> 02:44:00.261
Why don't you come with me?

1870
02:44:01.220 --> 02:44:02.722
Get into some trouble.

1871
02:44:03.472 --> 02:44:06.976
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.


1872
02:44:07.643 --> 02:44:09.270
The bat and the cat.

1873
02:44:10.771 --> 02:44:12.440
It's got a nice ring.

1874
02:44:25.786 --> 02:44:27.204
Who am I kidding?

1875
02:44:28.664 --> 02:44:30.791
You're already spoken for.

1876
02:44:42.678 --> 02:44:44.096
You should go.

1877
02:44:52.438 --> 02:44:53.439
Selina...

1878
02:44:57.526 --> 02:44:59.195
Take care of yourself.

1879
02:47:02.457 --> 02:47:07.457
