1
00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:23.541
<i>Detroit, give it up...</i>

2
00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:26.711
<i>for Trevor Noah!</i>

3
00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.072
What's going on, Detroit?

4
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.952
Oh! How you doing tonight, everybody?
How you doing?


5
00:00:59.035 --> 00:01:00.870
Welcome to the show.

6
00:01:00.954 --> 00:01:02.622
Thank you so much for coming out.

7
00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:04.958
Look at this.
What a night. What a feeling.


8
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:06.793
Here we are. Detroit, Michigan.

9
00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:08.461
We made it.

10
00:01:12.632 --> 00:01:15.426
I've really been enjoying it.
I'm enjoying everywhere, honestly.


11
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.347
I'm having more fun in my life now
than I think I've ever had.


12
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.435
I'm enjoying America more now
than I've ever, ever enjoyed it.


13
00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:27.313
Every day.

14
00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:30.567
I don't even know what it is.

15
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.901
I think it's...

16
00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:35.154
You enjoy a place differently
when it might be ending, you know?


17
00:01:35.238 --> 00:01:36.239
It just has a...

18
00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:39.742
It has a different feeling to it, like...

19
00:01:39.826 --> 00:01:41.202
"Mmm, what is that taste?"

20
00:01:41.286 --> 00:01:43.204
"The final season? Mmm-mmm-mmm"

21
00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:49.919
'Cause you never know with America.
You really never know.


22
00:01:50.503 --> 00:01:53.590
Every day is the best day,
and possibly the last day.


23
00:01:55.925 --> 00:01:58.636
I'm having an amazing time, I truly am.

24
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.014
This year was such a blessing, because...

25
00:02:01.097 --> 00:02:02.849
I got to travel around the world,

26
00:02:02.932 --> 00:02:05.059
doing shows in places
I had never performed before.


27
00:02:05.143 --> 00:02:08.980
Places I've always wanted to do comedy,
I've always wanted to try it out.


28
00:02:09.063 --> 00:02:13.443
I did shows in Berlin, Germany,
for the first time ever.


29
00:02:13.526 --> 00:02:14.986
That was really amazing.

30
00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.156
I won't lie, people freaked me out
before I went there.


31
00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.368
Similar to Detroit, where people are like,
"Oh, watch out, Detroit."


32
00:02:22.452 --> 00:02:24.621
People were like that
with Germany as well.


33
00:02:24.704 --> 00:02:27.749
Like, when I was going to Berlin,
people were like, "Dude, Germany?"


34
00:02:27.832 --> 00:02:29.292
"Do they even laugh?"

35
00:02:30.668 --> 00:02:32.795
I'm like, "What do you mean?
They're human beings."


36
00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.672
"I don't know, man. 
Do they laugh?"

37
00:02:35.757 --> 00:02:36.758
People got to me.

38
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:38.676
At a point
when I was heading to Germany,


39
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.596
I was like, maybe Germans just sit
in the audience, like,


40
00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:44.140
"Uh-huh. <i>Ja, ja,</i> uh-huh."

41
00:02:44.224 --> 00:02:46.017
"That was a comedy show."

42
00:02:48.144 --> 00:02:50.146
But they don't. They laugh.

43
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.023
They're actually great audiences.

44
00:02:52.607 --> 00:02:54.776
I had an amazing time in Berlin.

45
00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.737
It's a city that sneaks up on you,
because it's...


46
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.366
It's so culturally diverse. You know?

47
00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:03.701
It has a burgeoning art scene.

48
00:03:04.243 --> 00:03:06.120
Fantastic music.

49
00:03:06.204 --> 00:03:07.372
The history...

50
00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.626
The history in Berlin
is truly deep and rich.


51
00:03:12.377 --> 00:03:17.423
I love traveling and seeing places
whenever I'm in certain cities


52
00:03:17.507 --> 00:03:20.760
and in Berlin,
I went out with a tour group


53
00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:22.470
and I had a great time.

54
00:03:22.553 --> 00:03:27.308
But I wish someone had warned me
how painful a lot of Berlin's history is.


55
00:03:27.392 --> 00:03:31.229
'Cause that was basically
the headquarters of the Nazi Party.


56
00:03:31.312 --> 00:03:34.399
So everything ties back to Hitler.
I didn't know this.


57
00:03:34.482 --> 00:03:36.651
I thought we're going
on a cute little tour.


58
00:03:37.193 --> 00:03:39.404
I ask a lot of questions.
I'm curious.


59
00:03:39.946 --> 00:03:41.531
This brought the mood down.

60
00:03:44.742 --> 00:03:45.994
We're out and about.

61
00:03:46.077 --> 00:03:47.704
The tour guide was doing his schtick.

62
00:03:47.787 --> 00:03:48.913
He was happy as well.

63
00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:51.040
"Here, behind me, you can see,

64
00:03:51.124 --> 00:03:55.086
this is one of the largest airports
that was ever built in the world."


65
00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.840
<i>"Ja,</i> it is a world famous airport
here in Berlin,


66
00:03:58.923 --> 00:04:01.676
and it is so large
that we were able..."


67
00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:06.681
"They filmed the Hollywood movie
<i>The Hunger Games</i> inside this airport."


68
00:04:06.764 --> 00:04:08.474
<i>"Ja,</i> any questions?"

69
00:04:08.558 --> 00:04:11.144
I said,
"Yeah. Wow. How old is this thing?"


70
00:04:11.227 --> 00:04:13.813
"This is almost 100 years old."

71
00:04:13.896 --> 00:04:14.981
And I'm like,

72
00:04:15.064 --> 00:04:16.149
"Damn! Who built it?"

73
00:04:22.155 --> 00:04:24.741
"Yeah. That is
the unfortunate part of the...


74
00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.660
of the story here."

75
00:04:28.286 --> 00:04:31.331
"This airport was built by, uh, Hitler."

76
00:04:33.082 --> 00:04:35.251
I could see I'd messed things up.

77
00:04:35.335 --> 00:04:36.836
I tried to bring the mood up.

78
00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.421
I was like, "Which Hitler?"

79
00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:42.425
He says,
"Which Hitler?"


80
00:04:42.508 --> 00:04:43.926
"Which other Hitler is there?"

81
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.596
I was like, "Could be Henry Hitler."
"Henry Hitler?"


82
00:04:46.679 --> 00:04:48.264
"Who the hell is Henry Hitler?"

83
00:04:48.348 --> 00:04:50.475
I was like, "You don't know Henry Hitler?"

84
00:04:51.434 --> 00:04:52.477
It didn't work.

85
00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.314
Like, "Yo, man."

86
00:04:57.648 --> 00:04:59.317
It was tense, but it was good.

87
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.902
And what I mean by good...

88
00:05:01.486 --> 00:05:02.987
It was nice to be in a place

89
00:05:03.696 --> 00:05:07.200
where people don't bury their history.

90
00:05:08.117 --> 00:05:10.244
What I mean by that...

91
00:05:13.664 --> 00:05:18.086
What I mean by that is that
when you travel through Germany,


92
00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.883
even if you don't go to museums,
you cannot escape the past


93
00:05:23.966 --> 00:05:26.886
of both Berlin and what Germany did.

94
00:05:27.678 --> 00:05:30.181
There are monuments
scattered throughout the city.


95
00:05:30.264 --> 00:05:31.849
Prominent monuments.

96
00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:35.937
They are memorializing what Germany did
to millions of Jewish people


97
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.022
and other people around the world.

98
00:05:38.106 --> 00:05:40.691
You see it, you understand it,
they talk about it.


99
00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:43.945
They teach their kids about it.
They teach children in school.


100
00:05:44.028 --> 00:05:46.697
They're like,
"Hey, this is what Germany did."


101
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:48.032
They make sure they know.

102
00:05:48.116 --> 00:05:50.743
But they don't make them
feel guilty about it.


103
00:05:51.327 --> 00:05:53.913
Which is an amazing balance
for them to strike.


104
00:05:53.996 --> 00:05:57.542
They'll say to the kids, they're like,
"Hey, kids. I hope you understand."


105
00:05:58.084 --> 00:05:59.335
"Germany did this."

106
00:05:59.418 --> 00:06:02.588
"You're not responsible
because you weren't there."


107
00:06:02.672 --> 00:06:06.551
"However, because you're
the future of Germany,


108
00:06:06.634 --> 00:06:09.971
it's your responsibility
to make sure this doesn't happen again."


109
00:06:16.727 --> 00:06:18.980
You know, what I loved
about being in Germany


110
00:06:19.063 --> 00:06:22.984
when they were talking about their history
is how forthright they are about it.


111
00:06:23.067 --> 00:06:24.318
They know it's painful.

112
00:06:24.402 --> 00:06:26.737
They know that it's a terrible blight

113
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.074
on who they are,
but they don't hide from it.


114
00:06:30.908 --> 00:06:33.119
When I saw them doing this, I went,

115
00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:35.913
"Man, I wish
America did this with history." You know?


116
00:06:37.874 --> 00:06:39.125
'Cause you...

117
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.921
You ever see how awkward it is,

118
00:06:44.547 --> 00:06:46.716
speaking about history in America?

119
00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:47.800
It gets tense.

120
00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:51.179
Doesn't matter what history it is.
It gets tense.


121
00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:54.473
Columbus Day is one of those days.

122
00:06:54.557 --> 00:06:58.394
Every year in New York, there's a fight.
Here in Detroit, there was a fight.


123
00:06:58.477 --> 00:07:01.814
There was a bust of Christopher Columbus,
was around for 110 years.


124
00:07:01.898 --> 00:07:04.650
At a point, half of Detroit was like,
"We need to get rid of it."


125
00:07:04.734 --> 00:07:07.445
The other half said, "Don't get rid
of it." It was a huge fight.


126
00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:10.781
New York, same thing, every year.
Columbus Day, Indigenous Peoples' Day.


127
00:07:10.865 --> 00:07:13.451
Columbus Day, Indigenous Peoples' Day.

128
00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:16.162
There was an interview
on the news I saw once.


129
00:07:16.245 --> 00:07:18.873
It wasn't supposed to be funny,
but I found it funny.


130
00:07:20.124 --> 00:07:22.001
The reporter went to a guy and asked,

131
00:07:22.084 --> 00:07:24.295
"What will you be doing
for Indigenous Peoples' Day?"


132
00:07:24.378 --> 00:07:26.839
He was like,
"It's Columbus Day,


133
00:07:26.923 --> 00:07:30.009
I'm sick and tired of people coming in
and changing the name."


134
00:07:30.092 --> 00:07:31.427
"We're proud of that day."

135
00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:34.889
"It's Christopher Columbus.
Columbus Day. It's not gonna change."


136
00:07:34.972 --> 00:07:37.558
"In fact, how would you feel
if somebody came along,


137
00:07:37.642 --> 00:07:40.269
took something
that's been around for a long time,


138
00:07:40.353 --> 00:07:43.439
and just decided to switch it
and call it something else?"


139
00:07:43.523 --> 00:07:45.691
"Huh? How would you feel?"

140
00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:51.822
I was like, "But, sir,

141
00:07:52.406 --> 00:07:54.492
isn't that the spirit of Columbus Day?"

142
00:07:58.746 --> 00:08:01.791
I'll be honest. I'm not a big fan
of Indigenous Peoples' Day.


143
00:08:01.874 --> 00:08:04.585
The title, I don't like...
I think it's a cop-out.


144
00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:06.921
I don't think it's specific enough.
It's lazy.


145
00:08:07.004 --> 00:08:09.715
"Indigenous Peoples' Day."
Which Indigenous people? Where? How?


146
00:08:09.799 --> 00:08:11.050
Give me something.

147
00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:13.344
You know what I liked about Columbus Day?

148
00:08:13.427 --> 00:08:14.804
It's that it was specific.

149
00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:20.351
Yeah. It was a specific, inspiring story

150
00:08:20.935 --> 00:08:24.313
of a man by the name Christopher Columbus

151
00:08:24.897 --> 00:08:26.857
who believed, against all odds,

152
00:08:27.608 --> 00:08:30.653
that he could sail
the wrong way around the world


153
00:08:32.989 --> 00:08:35.199
and get to India from the other side.

154
00:08:37.118 --> 00:08:38.369
Nobody believed in him.

155
00:08:38.869 --> 00:08:40.037
Yeah.

156
00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:43.374
He said, "I'm gonna do this."
They said, "You can't do it, Chris."


157
00:08:43.457 --> 00:08:46.168
He was like, "I will."
They're like, "You can't do it!"


158
00:08:46.252 --> 00:08:48.796
He said, "I will!" They said, "You can't!"

159
00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:52.550
And he raised money, he fought for years,
he finally got the ships.


160
00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:56.470
And he sailed the wrong way
around the world and he didn't do it.


161
00:09:02.435 --> 00:09:05.354
Not only did he not land
on the other side of India,


162
00:09:05.438 --> 00:09:08.232
he found himself in a place
called the Caribbean.


163
00:09:08.316 --> 00:09:11.193
And he was like, "This is India."

164
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.573
And the people went,
"I don't know


165
00:09:15.656 --> 00:09:18.284
if you've been eating
some of the herb we've been leaving about,


166
00:09:18.367 --> 00:09:19.827
but this is totally not India."

167
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:22.622
He was like, "This is India
and you guys are Indians."


168
00:09:22.705 --> 00:09:24.874
They're like,
"Brother, we are not Indians."


169
00:09:24.957 --> 00:09:27.460
He's like, "I know Indians
when I don't see them."


170
00:09:27.543 --> 00:09:30.087
"You're Indians, just on the far side."

171
00:09:30.171 --> 00:09:31.547
"So you're West Indians."

172
00:09:35.343 --> 00:09:36.469
And he stuck with it.

173
00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:40.514
Christopher Columbus
stuck with it his entire life.


174
00:09:40.598 --> 00:09:43.184
Other explorers would come to him
like, "Yo, Chris."


175
00:09:43.267 --> 00:09:46.270
"I don't think you made it to India."

176
00:09:46.354 --> 00:09:47.938
He's like, "It's India."

177
00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:51.275
They're like, "I don't think it's India."
He's like, "It's India."


178
00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:54.028
He died refusing
to acknowledge the possibility


179
00:09:54.111 --> 00:09:56.614
that he never made it to India.

180
00:09:56.697 --> 00:10:01.369
Not only that, my friends,
he never set foot in America,


181
00:10:02.078 --> 00:10:03.079
ever.

182
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:04.872
Ever.

183
00:10:04.955 --> 00:10:08.668
And yet, he had a public holiday

184
00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:11.837
named after him

185
00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:14.090
in America.

186
00:10:15.925 --> 00:10:18.886
That, my friends, is the inspiring story

187
00:10:21.097 --> 00:10:23.182
of how white men can fail up.

188
00:10:34.151 --> 00:10:37.405
Do you know how much confidence
you have to have to pull that off?


189
00:10:37.947 --> 00:10:40.074
Nobody else. That is white man confidence.

190
00:10:40.157 --> 00:10:42.493
Nobody else possesses
that level of confidence.


191
00:10:43.202 --> 00:10:45.371
Go the wrong way.
End up in the wrong place.


192
00:10:45.454 --> 00:10:48.124
Call the wrong people the wrong name
and be like, "I'm right."


193
00:10:48.207 --> 00:10:49.583
"Give me a holiday."

194
00:10:51.502 --> 00:10:52.753
No one else can do that.

195
00:10:52.837 --> 00:10:56.215
That is the level of confidence
we should all aspire to,


196
00:10:56.298 --> 00:10:59.468
is white man levels of confidence.
Women couldn't pull that off.


197
00:10:59.552 --> 00:11:02.263
If a woman said, "I'll sail
the wrong way around the Earth."


198
00:11:02.346 --> 00:11:04.724
They'll be like,
"Burn her. She's a witch!"


199
00:11:07.768 --> 00:11:10.104
You think people of color could
pull that off?


200
00:11:10.187 --> 00:11:12.314
You think Black people could?
Wow, really?


201
00:11:12.398 --> 00:11:15.401
Like he was gonna sail around the world
the wrong way around.


202
00:11:15.484 --> 00:11:17.653
Get to the place
they're not supposed to be.


203
00:11:17.736 --> 00:11:19.697
Probably get arrested for trespassing.

204
00:11:20.948 --> 00:11:22.825
Like, "What are you doing here?"

205
00:11:22.908 --> 00:11:26.954
"My bad,
I thought I was getting to India."


206
00:11:27.037 --> 00:11:29.165
"Man, I don't know what I was thinking."

207
00:11:29.248 --> 00:11:32.418
"We should've never messed with ships.
It never turns out good."


208
00:11:32.501 --> 00:11:35.421
"I apologize. I apologize, man."

209
00:11:35.504 --> 00:11:36.881
"This won't happen again."

210
00:11:43.053 --> 00:11:45.014
Why would you wanna bury your history?

211
00:11:46.056 --> 00:11:48.517
There's so much joy
and so much to learn.

212
00:11:49.101 --> 00:11:50.019
You know?

213
00:11:50.102 --> 00:11:52.855
It feels like America
is moving in that direction.


214
00:11:52.938 --> 00:11:55.941
It wants less and less of its history,
less and less context.


215
00:11:56.025 --> 00:11:58.319
You look what's happening
with textbooks.


216
00:11:58.402 --> 00:12:01.363
Places like Florida,
they wanna ban textbooks


217
00:12:01.447 --> 00:12:05.326
or cut out the parts of the textbooks
that have slavery in the books.


218
00:12:05.409 --> 00:12:07.828
And now parents are fighting.
They're like,


219
00:12:07.912 --> 00:12:12.041
"No, no, take the slavery out.
It's making the kids feel bad."


220
00:12:12.124 --> 00:12:14.168
Other parents are like,
"Keep the slavery in."


221
00:12:14.251 --> 00:12:15.461
"It teaches children."

222
00:12:15.544 --> 00:12:18.714
And they're fighting
back and forth. I'm like, "Why?"


223
00:12:18.797 --> 00:12:20.799
You don't need to be fighting about...

224
00:12:20.883 --> 00:12:22.760
No one should be fighting about this.

225
00:12:23.719 --> 00:12:25.346
Kids don't read textbooks.

226
00:12:33.145 --> 00:12:34.522
They watch TikTok.

227
00:12:35.481 --> 00:12:37.858
If you wanna get to the kids,
that's where you gotta be.


228
00:12:37.942 --> 00:12:39.235
<i>♪ There was slavery ♪</i>

229
00:12:39.318 --> 00:12:40.402
<i>♪ Ships came ♪</i>

230
00:12:40.486 --> 00:12:41.486
<i>♪ Yeah... ♪</i>

231
00:12:50.412 --> 00:12:54.416
I'll be honest. I don't think
that textbook thing is like a real issue.


232
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.086
I feel like it's one of those
manufactured issues


233
00:12:57.169 --> 00:13:00.339
that often happens in America
that gets people riled up


234
00:13:00.923 --> 00:13:03.050
and gets them fired up,

235
00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:06.262
fighting about something
that was never an issue to begin with.


236
00:13:06.845 --> 00:13:09.306
I say this
because that's honestly what I believe.


237
00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.810
I feel like in America,
politicians have done a really good job


238
00:13:12.893 --> 00:13:16.355
of tricking Americans
into fighting about issues


239
00:13:16.438 --> 00:13:18.649
that were never an issue to begin with,

240
00:13:18.732 --> 00:13:21.944
so that you don't pay attention
to the issues that actually are.


241
00:13:23.445 --> 00:13:24.446
You know?

242
00:13:28.325 --> 00:13:30.703
If you're fighting
about what's in a textbook,


243
00:13:30.786 --> 00:13:34.206
you don't pay attention to the fact
that inflation is out of control.


244
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.293
You don't pay attention
that rents are out of control.


245
00:13:37.376 --> 00:13:39.003
People cannot afford to live anywhere.

246
00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:41.213
Salaries have never
kept up with inflation.


247
00:13:41.297 --> 00:13:43.841
Corporations steal billions
and billions of dollars


248
00:13:43.924 --> 00:13:46.176
from their employees
with no ramifications.


249
00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.220
You don't pay attention to any of that.

250
00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:51.974
You pay attention to what's catchy,
what's easy to keep up with.


251
00:13:52.057 --> 00:13:53.851
It keeps you going, you know?

252
00:13:53.934 --> 00:13:57.104
"Ooh,
can trans people use public bathrooms?"


253
00:13:57.187 --> 00:13:58.439
"Ooh!"

254
00:13:59.982 --> 00:14:01.483
It's manufactured.

255
00:14:01.567 --> 00:14:04.111
Who was dealing with this issue? Honestly.

256
00:14:04.194 --> 00:14:06.405
Who was actually dealing with this issue?

257
00:14:06.488 --> 00:14:09.283
You know what they did?
Some politician figured out, they go,


258
00:14:09.366 --> 00:14:12.244
"Here's a small story affecting
a few people in a random place."


259
00:14:12.328 --> 00:14:14.705
"I'll make it seem
like a nationwide issue,


260
00:14:14.788 --> 00:14:17.458
then everyone starts fighting."
But who was dealing with it?


261
00:14:17.541 --> 00:14:21.003
Who has ever been in a situation
where you were in a bathroom,


262
00:14:21.086 --> 00:14:23.881
and all of a sudden a skirmish broke out
and people go,


263
00:14:23.964 --> 00:14:26.717
"Excuse me, is this the gender
that you were born with?"


264
00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.470
"Does it coincide
with the sign on the door?"


265
00:14:29.553 --> 00:14:31.805
"Is your genitalia matching this?"

266
00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:33.015
"Can I see it?"

267
00:14:33.098 --> 00:14:34.516
Who's ever seen that?

268
00:14:35.225 --> 00:14:36.225
Nobody.

269
00:14:37.645 --> 00:14:39.021
Nobody.

270
00:14:41.482 --> 00:14:44.276
But they make us fight about it
because it's catchy.


271
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:46.946
"Who can use which bathroom."
Who cares?


272
00:14:47.613 --> 00:14:49.865
Who cares? I mean it, who cares?

273
00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:51.825
I know some would be like,
"Trans people care."


274
00:14:51.909 --> 00:14:54.036
They wanna know
if they can use a public bathroom.


275
00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:57.164
Yeah, use whichever bathroom you want.
Who's gonna stop you?


276
00:14:58.082 --> 00:15:01.168
No, seriously, it's a public toilet.

277
00:15:01.251 --> 00:15:03.003
Who is going to stop you?

278
00:15:03.087 --> 00:15:05.839
You tell me
who's gonna enforce that law?


279
00:15:06.715 --> 00:15:08.258
We can't even enforce the idea

280
00:15:08.342 --> 00:15:10.386
that people should shit into the toilet.

281
00:15:13.555 --> 00:15:17.810
But you think magically they're gonna
figure out if you were born this way.


282
00:15:19.228 --> 00:15:22.773
Use whichever one you want.
Why are we wasting our time?


283
00:15:24.024 --> 00:15:25.150
Other people are like,

284
00:15:25.234 --> 00:15:27.569
"We'll fight
because you gotta know who's..."


285
00:15:27.653 --> 00:15:30.572
Let me tell you something.
If you are spending enough time


286
00:15:30.656 --> 00:15:33.784
to know the genitalia of the other people
in a public bathroom,


287
00:15:33.867 --> 00:15:35.077
you're the creep.

288
00:15:37.788 --> 00:15:38.956
I'm worried about you.

289
00:15:42.501 --> 00:15:45.629
There is a simple rule
to every public toilet around the world.


290
00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:48.841
And that rule is, you get in,
pay no attention to anyone else,


291
00:15:48.924 --> 00:15:50.592
hold your breath and you get out.

292
00:15:52.344 --> 00:15:54.680
Quit standing around
staring at other people.


293
00:15:54.763 --> 00:15:56.974
Every man in this room knows
when we use the toilet,


294
00:15:57.057 --> 00:16:00.185
we get in, public toilet,
you stare dead ahead, you pee,


295
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:02.396
do your thing.
Do not look to either side.


296
00:16:02.479 --> 00:16:04.398
If you're fidgety, look up, look down.

297
00:16:04.481 --> 00:16:06.066
You do not look at anyone else.

298
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.944
The guy next to you can start choking.
You don't turn your head.


299
00:16:09.028 --> 00:16:11.155
You don't shake, you don't move.

300
00:16:11.238 --> 00:16:12.448
You hear him, like...

301
00:16:14.324 --> 00:16:16.577
You be like, "Hey, man, hey. Hey."

302
00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.038
"Hey, you all right? Yo, yo."

303
00:16:19.121 --> 00:16:20.539
"Hey, man, you okay?"

304
00:16:20.622 --> 00:16:23.208
"Yo, yo. You want me to call...
Hey, man, are you okay?"


305
00:16:23.292 --> 00:16:26.128
"You wanna call... ""Don't look at me!"

306
00:16:30.632 --> 00:16:31.632
What are we doing?

307
00:16:33.052 --> 00:16:34.428
What are we fighting about?

308
00:16:35.554 --> 00:16:36.972
Public bathrooms.

309
00:16:37.056 --> 00:16:41.018
If you know your history, you know
this happens all the time in America.


310
00:16:41.101 --> 00:16:44.313
It happens over and over and over again.

311
00:16:44.396 --> 00:16:48.275
There was a time when women had to fight
to use public bathrooms in America.


312
00:16:48.358 --> 00:16:49.359
Imagine that.

313
00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:52.654
There was literally a time when women
weren't allowed to use public bathrooms


314
00:16:52.738 --> 00:16:54.823
all across America and they had to fight.

315
00:16:54.907 --> 00:16:57.743
And there were men who were angry.
They were like, "This is crazy."


316
00:16:57.826 --> 00:17:02.164
"You're gonna have women
in public bathrooms? That's insane!"


317
00:17:02.247 --> 00:17:04.708
"How does it work, huh?"

318
00:17:04.792 --> 00:17:08.128
"What, they're gonna come in there
while we're peeing?"


319
00:17:08.212 --> 00:17:10.714
"And then what?
They're gonna look at our wieners?"


320
00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:13.217
"And they're gonna laugh, huh?"

321
00:17:16.553 --> 00:17:17.930
Think about this, ladies.

322
00:17:18.013 --> 00:17:23.852
There was a time when women were first
allowed to step into the workplace,


323
00:17:23.936 --> 00:17:26.563
where there were no public bathrooms
they could use.


324
00:17:26.647 --> 00:17:29.983
So, ladies, if you were out and about
back then, you needed to pee,


325
00:17:30.067 --> 00:17:31.652
you needed to poo,
you had to go home.


326
00:17:31.735 --> 00:17:33.570
Yeah. And I say poo theoretically,

327
00:17:33.654 --> 00:17:35.447
I don't know if you actually do.

328
00:17:36.198 --> 00:17:39.451
No, I don't think any guy does.
Let's be honest. We don't.


329
00:17:39.535 --> 00:17:44.248
We assume this on a biological level,
but I don't know for certain


330
00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:46.208
that any woman actually...

331
00:17:46.291 --> 00:17:49.169
In fact, any man in here,
think of any woman in your life.


332
00:17:49.253 --> 00:17:52.214
Do you know the last time she pooed?
I don't think you know.


333
00:17:52.297 --> 00:17:53.757
I don't think you know.

334
00:17:53.841 --> 00:17:56.552
There is no forensic evidence
to back up that claim.


335
00:17:57.094 --> 00:17:58.220
There is no smell.

336
00:17:59.054 --> 00:18:01.098
There is no stain.
There is no nothing.


337
00:18:02.015 --> 00:18:04.351
Ladies, I don't know
who does your bathroom PR,


338
00:18:04.434 --> 00:18:06.103
but they are doing a stellar job.

339
00:18:06.186 --> 00:18:07.855
Stellar job.

340
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:11.692
Women go to the bathroom,
smells better when they come out of it.


341
00:18:11.775 --> 00:18:12.775
How?

342
00:18:13.235 --> 00:18:16.655
You never know
when a lady is pooing. Never.


343
00:18:17.197 --> 00:18:19.658
Because also,
women keep the same amount of time.


344
00:18:19.741 --> 00:18:22.286
That's the most impressive thing.
You give nothing away.


345
00:18:22.369 --> 00:18:24.955
Yeah, a woman's gonna go pee,
it takes ten minutes.


346
00:18:25.038 --> 00:18:26.874
She goes to the bathroom. All right.

347
00:18:26.957 --> 00:18:30.544
Gets there, tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
comes out, washes her hand,


348
00:18:30.627 --> 00:18:33.505
powders her face, texts on the phone,
comes back to the table.


349
00:18:33.589 --> 00:18:35.007
You have no clue. Yeah.

350
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:37.301
She's gonna go poo,
same thing, ten minutes.


351
00:18:37.384 --> 00:18:38.510
Goes to the bathroom,

352
00:18:38.594 --> 00:18:40.929
pellets, pellets, pellets,
comes back out.


353
00:18:41.013 --> 00:18:44.683
Wash her hands, powder the nose,
text her friends. Get back out there.


354
00:18:45.642 --> 00:18:46.643
You have no clue.

355
00:18:47.561 --> 00:18:49.813
With men,
you know exactly what we're doing.


356
00:18:51.773 --> 00:18:53.358
Discretion is not our forte.

357
00:18:55.027 --> 00:18:57.613
You know when every single man
is gonna go pee. Why?


358
00:18:57.696 --> 00:18:58.989
Two minutes.

359
00:18:59.573 --> 00:19:02.451
Off to the bathroom, we're in there.
Quickest thing ever.


360
00:19:02.534 --> 00:19:03.952
It's like a NASCAR pit stop.

361
00:19:04.786 --> 00:19:07.122
Yeah, we get in, we
pee, we come back out,

362
00:19:07.206 --> 00:19:09.708
act like we're washing our hands
and we're back.


363
00:19:13.629 --> 00:19:15.672
How do you know
when we take a dump?


364
00:19:15.756 --> 00:19:18.675
'Cause it's obvious.
We go to the bathroom, never come back.


365
00:19:20.093 --> 00:19:22.512
That's the last time you'll ever see us.

366
00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:25.474
Your family's putting up
wanted posters in the restaurant.


367
00:19:25.557 --> 00:19:27.351
"Have you seen this man?"

368
00:19:30.979 --> 00:19:34.399
Imagine, people were fighting
about bathrooms every time in America.


369
00:19:34.483 --> 00:19:37.653
Every time. There was a time
when Black people had to fight


370
00:19:37.736 --> 00:19:39.696
to use public bathrooms. Huh.

371
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.951
Same thing. Black people were like,
"Why can we not use public bathrooms?"


372
00:19:44.493 --> 00:19:45.953
And again, people were angry.

373
00:19:46.036 --> 00:19:47.371
"This is crazy."

374
00:19:47.454 --> 00:19:51.208
"You're gonna have Black people in this
in a public bathroom?"


375
00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:53.252
"How does that even work, huh?"

376
00:19:53.335 --> 00:19:57.130
"So what? They're gonna be
standing there while I pee, huh?"


377
00:19:57.214 --> 00:19:59.424
"They're gonna be
looking at my wiener? Huh?"


378
00:19:59.508 --> 00:20:01.718
"And they're gonna laugh? Huh?"

379
00:20:08.267 --> 00:20:09.893
I'm old enough to remember

380
00:20:10.686 --> 00:20:12.604
when there was a discussion in America

381
00:20:12.688 --> 00:20:15.274
about whether gay people
could use public bathrooms.


382
00:20:15.857 --> 00:20:17.859
This was an actual topic of discussion.

383
00:20:18.777 --> 00:20:21.154
I remember people on the news
being interviewed.


384
00:20:21.238 --> 00:20:24.366
"Do you think gay men should
be allowed into the same bathrooms


385
00:20:24.449 --> 00:20:27.536
as straight men?" They'll be like,
"I don't mind what they do,


386
00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:29.705
if they keep it to themselves,
that's fine."


387
00:20:29.788 --> 00:20:33.875
"But just answer me this.
Answer me this. How is it gonna work?"


388
00:20:34.501 --> 00:20:37.462
"So what? You're in the bathroom
with them and then what?"


389
00:20:37.546 --> 00:20:39.673
"He's gay and I'm just standing there

390
00:20:39.756 --> 00:20:41.133
and I'm peeing, huh?"

391
00:20:41.216 --> 00:20:44.136
"And he's looking at my wiener? Huh?"

392
00:20:44.219 --> 00:20:46.388
"And then he grabs it, huh?"

393
00:20:47.264 --> 00:20:49.433
"And he starts yanking on it, huh?"

394
00:20:49.516 --> 00:20:50.976
"He just starts tugging away

395
00:20:51.059 --> 00:20:53.854
and I get hard
and I'm enjoying it, huh?"

396
00:20:53.937 --> 00:20:57.733
"And then this is one of the best
experiences I've ever had, huh?"


397
00:20:58.317 --> 00:21:00.152
"And then I start coming back weekly

398
00:21:00.235 --> 00:21:02.863
hoping I'll bump into
him and I do, huh?"

399
00:21:02.946 --> 00:21:05.240
"And then at some point
we agree to meet outside,


400
00:21:05.324 --> 00:21:08.660
a nice little restaurant that's cozy
and get to know each other, huh?"


401
00:21:08.744 --> 00:21:10.996
"And then a few years later,
we get married


402
00:21:11.079 --> 00:21:13.540
and our families are joined
and we live happily ever after?"


403
00:21:13.623 --> 00:21:15.042
"Is that what you want?"

404
00:21:20.005 --> 00:21:21.006
Wow.

405
00:21:24.384 --> 00:21:25.510
Public bathrooms.

406
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.724
It's why you shouldn't bury your history.

407
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.229
If you know what's happened,
you know what to predict.


408
00:21:36.313 --> 00:21:39.024
You understand why it happened
in the first place.


409
00:21:39.107 --> 00:21:41.568
Germany does that
in a truly astounding way.


410
00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:43.320
It will never be perfect.

411
00:21:43.403 --> 00:21:46.073
But Germany is one of the only countries
in the world


412
00:21:46.156 --> 00:21:48.950
that has actively
paid reparations for what they did.


413
00:21:50.077 --> 00:21:54.164
One of the only countries in the world
that has actively apologized


414
00:21:55.499 --> 00:21:59.086
and one of the only countries in the world
that's set about changing


415
00:21:59.169 --> 00:22:02.297
how they see themselves
and how the world sees them.


416
00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:06.385
After World War II,
Germany changed a bunch of laws.


417
00:22:06.468 --> 00:22:08.887
They changed the iconography
of the country.


418
00:22:08.970 --> 00:22:10.847
What you could hang,
where you could hang it.


419
00:22:10.931 --> 00:22:13.016
They changed their national anthem.

420
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.852
Yeah, imagine that,
they changed the national anthem.


421
00:22:16.686 --> 00:22:19.731
They felt that the national anthem
was a nationalist song


422
00:22:19.815 --> 00:22:22.567
that the Nazis used to inspire people
to think the wrong things.


423
00:22:22.651 --> 00:22:24.903
They changed it.
The original song was called


424
00:22:24.986 --> 00:22:27.030
<i>"Deutschland, 
Deutschland über alles."</i>

425
00:22:27.114 --> 00:22:29.658
You've probably heard it
in old movies or whatever.


426
00:22:29.741 --> 00:22:30.617
The song went like...

427
00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:40.794
And translated into English, it means...

428
00:22:40.877 --> 00:22:44.673
<i>♪ Germany, 
Germany over everything ♪</i>

429
00:22:44.756 --> 00:22:48.009
<i>♪ Over everything in the world ♪</i>

430
00:22:49.511 --> 00:22:50.846
And clearly they meant it.

431
00:22:52.556 --> 00:22:56.893
Yeah, where most anthems are theoretical,
the Germans are precise.


432
00:22:59.938 --> 00:23:03.817
But after World War II, they were like,
"We can't have that same attitude."


433
00:23:04.359 --> 00:23:05.944
And so they changed the anthem.

434
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:07.612
And new lyrics.

435
00:23:07.696 --> 00:23:09.030
The new lyrics are...

436
00:23:17.289 --> 00:23:19.291
Which translated into English is...

437
00:23:19.833 --> 00:23:24.004
<i>♪ Unity and rights and freedom ♪</i>

438
00:23:24.087 --> 00:23:27.507
<i>♪ For all the people
who live in Germany ♪</i>

439
00:23:30.427 --> 00:23:33.305
Which... Which is adorable.

440
00:23:35.098 --> 00:23:37.350
It's adorable.
They may as well have made the song...


441
00:23:37.434 --> 00:23:40.478
<i>♪ Sorry, sorry
We're so, so sorry ♪</i>


442
00:23:40.562 --> 00:23:43.523
<i>♪ Sorry, sorry, sorry
for what we did ♪</i>

443
00:23:46.776 --> 00:23:49.988
I appreciate that they did it,
but I wouldn't have gone that far.


444
00:23:50.071 --> 00:23:52.199
I won't lie.
I wouldn't have gone that far.


445
00:23:52.282 --> 00:23:55.410
I think <i>über alles</i> is terrible.
That's not a good way to think.


446
00:23:55.493 --> 00:23:57.871
But you still gotta have
a bit of kick in your anthem.


447
00:23:57.954 --> 00:24:00.665
You still gotta have a...
I would've found a middle ground.


448
00:24:00.749 --> 00:24:01.833
Mine would have been...

449
00:24:01.917 --> 00:24:04.461
<i>♪ Germany
Germany, somewhere... ♪</i>


450
00:24:04.544 --> 00:24:06.046
...in the top five.

451
00:24:07.047 --> 00:24:09.925
<i>♪ Not over everything in the world ♪</i>

452
00:24:11.051 --> 00:24:13.970
<i>♪ Because we are definitely
In the top five ♪</i>


453
00:24:14.054 --> 00:24:15.764
<i>♪ When you think about it ♪</i>

454
00:24:15.847 --> 00:24:17.349
<i>♪ America's number one ♪</i>

<i>über alles</i> of the world!

467
00:24:55.303 --> 00:24:57.806
It's one
of the biggest things they did,


468
00:24:57.889 --> 00:24:59.724
and nobody knows that they did it.

469
00:25:00.892 --> 00:25:03.144
I was chatting to a German guy.

470
00:25:03.812 --> 00:25:06.481
And he was perplexed by this.
Absolutely perplexed.


471
00:25:06.564 --> 00:25:09.859
He said... "In Germany
we've done so many things."


472
00:25:09.943 --> 00:25:12.320
"The national anthem
was a big change for us."


473
00:25:12.404 --> 00:25:14.572
"I'm sure
the whole world talks about this."


474
00:25:16.574 --> 00:25:18.702
I said, "Nope."

475
00:25:19.286 --> 00:25:20.912
He was like, "What do you mean?"

476
00:25:20.996 --> 00:25:23.331
"What do you mean?
Who doesn't talk about it?"


477
00:25:23.415 --> 00:25:25.583
I was like, "Nobody.
Nobody talks about it."


478
00:25:25.667 --> 00:25:28.503
"Who's nobody?"
I was like, "Nobody. No one."


479
00:25:28.586 --> 00:25:30.755
"No one outside of Germany
even knows this."


480
00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:33.800
"How can they not know?"
I was like, "What do you mean?"


481
00:25:33.883 --> 00:25:36.469
"It's German. No one speaks German
outside Germany."


482
00:25:36.553 --> 00:25:37.762
"How would anyone know?"

483
00:25:37.846 --> 00:25:39.764
"Also, you guys did something weird."

484
00:25:39.848 --> 00:25:43.601
"You changed the lyrics,
but you kept the beat."


485
00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.148
It's a strange move.

486
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:52.694
You're like, "This song
is terrible, and we're changing it."


487
00:25:52.777 --> 00:25:54.112
<i>"Ja.</i> What about the beat?"

488
00:25:54.195 --> 00:25:57.365
"No, we are keeping that 'cause
I've learned all the moves. <i>Ja."</i>


489
00:26:01.286 --> 00:26:04.539
That's probably why most people
don't know it changed.


490
00:26:04.622 --> 00:26:08.376
You've kept the beat.
Most people don't know the lyrics.


491
00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.878
We just know the beat.

492
00:26:09.961 --> 00:26:12.589
No one knew Michael Jackson
was saying, "You're a vegetable."


493
00:26:12.672 --> 00:26:13.965
None of us knew that.

494
00:26:14.049 --> 00:26:16.634
Some of you are like,
"When did he say 'vegetable'?"


495
00:26:16.718 --> 00:26:18.386
Been singing it your whole life...

496
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:19.679
<i>♪ You're a vegetable ♪</i>

497
00:26:21.806 --> 00:26:24.059
No one knows lyrics.
We just know the beat.


498
00:26:26.019 --> 00:26:28.021
That's what Germany did. It's weird.

499
00:26:28.772 --> 00:26:33.360
It's weird to not change the music.
'Cause the music comes with emotion.


500
00:26:34.277 --> 00:26:37.030
I was trying to explain this to him.
He didn't get it.


501
00:26:37.989 --> 00:26:40.075
And I realized,
you know what it's like.


502
00:26:40.158 --> 00:26:41.159
What Germany did,

503
00:26:41.785 --> 00:26:44.329
it would be like
if in <i>Star Wars,</i> right?

504
00:26:44.412 --> 00:26:48.208
You know <i>Star Wars.</i>
All right, let's say, Darth Vader.


505
00:26:48.291 --> 00:26:50.293
Whenever Darth Vader came into a scene,

506
00:26:50.377 --> 00:26:52.629
whenever he landed
on one of those planets,


507
00:26:52.712 --> 00:26:55.173
you always knew something
was about to go down,


508
00:26:55.256 --> 00:26:56.508
something bad,

509
00:26:56.591 --> 00:26:58.009
because he had his music.

510
00:26:58.676 --> 00:27:01.262
All right?
The music told you what was gonna happen.


511
00:27:01.346 --> 00:27:02.472
The ship would land...

512
00:27:04.641 --> 00:27:05.642
Door would open...

513
00:27:07.268 --> 00:27:08.645
And he'd be standing there.

514
00:27:13.441 --> 00:27:14.526
But he would never...

515
00:27:14.609 --> 00:27:17.904
He would never come into the game
without his song playing.


516
00:27:17.987 --> 00:27:20.907
Never. He'll be there,
DJ on the side, like,


517
00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.951
"DJ, play my jam."

518
00:27:31.543 --> 00:27:32.544
"That's right."

519
00:27:36.714 --> 00:27:37.714
"Uh-huh."

520
00:27:41.678 --> 00:27:43.805
And then you knew it
was about to go down.

521
00:27:44.681 --> 00:27:45.557
Get down there...

522
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.725
"Kneel before me, Jedi."

523
00:27:47.809 --> 00:27:50.061
"We'll never kneel
before you."


524
00:27:54.691 --> 00:27:56.943
"You cannot defeat me."

525
00:27:57.026 --> 00:27:59.821
"He's so strong.
I don't know if we're gonna win."


526
00:27:59.904 --> 00:28:01.406
"Defeat him, we shall."

527
00:28:04.284 --> 00:28:05.535
"Use the Force, we will."

528
00:28:08.204 --> 00:28:12.208
"Ahh, you have defeated me!"

529
00:28:12.292 --> 00:28:14.544
"We did it, Master Yoda! We did it!

530
00:28:14.627 --> 00:28:16.004
"We defeated Darth Vader!"

531
00:28:16.087 --> 00:28:17.630
"Indeed, we have."

532
00:28:17.714 --> 00:28:18.882
"What do we do now?"

533
00:28:18.965 --> 00:28:20.925
"Free the Empire, we shall."

534
00:28:21.009 --> 00:28:23.344
"Travel around,
the good news we shall spread."


535
00:28:23.428 --> 00:28:24.304
"Let's do it."

536
00:28:24.387 --> 00:28:26.681
"Yes, a new song we shall play."

537
00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.061
"You're free."

538
00:28:35.732 --> 00:28:37.442
It's weird.

539
00:28:48.286 --> 00:28:50.663
It's still impressive, though.
Still impressive.


540
00:28:50.747 --> 00:28:54.876
Changing your national anthem
is no small thing.


541
00:28:54.959 --> 00:28:55.960
It truly isn't.

542
00:28:56.753 --> 00:28:58.046
Changing anything.

543
00:28:58.129 --> 00:28:59.881
We were having this conversation.

544
00:29:00.465 --> 00:29:03.134
And afterwards, he said
something interesting, he's like,


545
00:29:03.218 --> 00:29:06.513
"Because we saw
how Germany had to change


546
00:29:06.596 --> 00:29:09.766
how it saw itself
in order to change what it did,


547
00:29:09.849 --> 00:29:11.643
it's why we changed the anthem."

548
00:29:11.726 --> 00:29:13.311
I was like, "That's powerful."

549
00:29:13.394 --> 00:29:15.688
He's like, "Do you think
America would ever change..."


550
00:29:15.772 --> 00:29:18.274
I was like,
"Don't even finish that sentence."


551
00:29:18.358 --> 00:29:22.070
"You don't even finish that sentence."

552
00:29:23.488 --> 00:29:27.826
If there's one thing I've learned,
America hates change.


553
00:29:28.493 --> 00:29:33.039
Whoo! America does not like change.

554
00:29:34.332 --> 00:29:36.209
You wanna change
the things Germany changed?


555
00:29:36.292 --> 00:29:38.795
The money, the flags, the anthem.
Are you kidding me?


556
00:29:38.878 --> 00:29:41.297
Remember when they tried
to change the $20 bill?


557
00:29:41.881 --> 00:29:43.132
Remember that?

558
00:29:43.216 --> 00:29:45.552
They said they'd put
Harriet Tubman on the bill.


559
00:29:45.635 --> 00:29:48.805
People got so angry,
they postponed it indefinitely.


560
00:29:49.889 --> 00:29:52.350
People were furious. "What are you doing?"

561
00:29:52.433 --> 00:29:54.561
"We're putting Harriet..."
"How dare you?"


562
00:29:54.644 --> 00:29:58.398
"How dare you take
an American president off the $20?"


563
00:29:58.481 --> 00:29:59.816
"How dare you take..."

564
00:29:59.899 --> 00:30:01.401
"Who's on the $20?"

565
00:30:02.068 --> 00:30:06.990
"How dare you take Andrew Jackson
off the $20 bill?"


566
00:30:07.073 --> 00:30:09.909
"They're just putting
Harriet Tubman on the front,


567
00:30:09.993 --> 00:30:11.703
and Andrew Jackson will be on the back."

568
00:30:11.786 --> 00:30:15.415
"You're putting an American president
on the back? On the back?"


569
00:30:15.498 --> 00:30:17.083
"That's disrespectful!"

570
00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:18.418
It's not, really.

571
00:30:18.501 --> 00:30:20.503
If you know your history,
you would know,


572
00:30:20.587 --> 00:30:23.381
Andrew Jackson would love to be
on the back side of a Black woman,


573
00:30:23.464 --> 00:30:25.466
so I don't know why you're so stressed.

574
00:30:27.302 --> 00:30:28.803
I feel like everybody wins.

575
00:30:35.143 --> 00:30:36.978
People were furious, though.

576
00:30:37.687 --> 00:30:40.523
And now you're gonna suggest
changing the flag?


577
00:30:40.607 --> 00:30:42.984
Suggest changing the anthem? Whoo!

578
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:46.154
There's two things I've learned,
living in America.


579
00:30:46.237 --> 00:30:50.116
It's you respect the flag
and you respect the anthem.


580
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:52.327
I don't know what it means.

581
00:30:53.745 --> 00:30:55.038
But I follow the rules.

582
00:30:56.956 --> 00:30:59.459
I say I don't know
what it means is because it's confusing.


583
00:30:59.542 --> 00:31:02.879
You'll meet people like,
"You respect the flag!" and I get it.


584
00:31:02.962 --> 00:31:05.340
But then I'll see those same people
on July 4th,


585
00:31:05.423 --> 00:31:07.634
and they'll be wearing the flag
as underwear.


586
00:31:11.971 --> 00:31:12.972
Does that count?

587
00:31:14.307 --> 00:31:16.100
And you looked up
and you were like,


588
00:31:16.184 --> 00:31:17.769
"That flag, these balls."

589
00:31:25.693 --> 00:31:27.820
I would never suggest changing any of it.

590
00:31:27.904 --> 00:31:29.822
The anthem? Oh, no, never the anthem.

591
00:31:30.365 --> 00:31:32.992
Even though it could.
Maybe it could do with a little change.


592
00:31:33.076 --> 00:31:35.370
It is a very violent anthem.

593
00:31:35.995 --> 00:31:38.331
And America struggles with violence,

594
00:31:38.414 --> 00:31:39.749
Maybe like a softer...

595
00:31:39.832 --> 00:31:41.250
It's a violent anthem.

596
00:31:41.334 --> 00:31:45.421
It's the only anthem I've ever heard
that has bombs blowing up in it.


597
00:31:46.047 --> 00:31:50.134
Yeah. There are bombs and rockets
in your national anthem.


598
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.804
It's like a Michael
Bay movie in a song.

599
00:31:53.721 --> 00:31:55.723
Everything blowing up in slow motion.

600
00:31:57.892 --> 00:32:00.853
It's almost like you're threatening
other countries as well.


601
00:32:00.937 --> 00:32:04.190
It's like, "Yeah, bombs bursting
and rockets were flaring."


602
00:32:04.273 --> 00:32:05.273
"Try us."

603
00:32:07.443 --> 00:32:09.404
It's like a gangster rap, to be honest.

604
00:32:10.571 --> 00:32:11.406
It really is.

605
00:32:11.489 --> 00:32:13.783
The American anthem
is like a gangster rap.


606
00:32:13.866 --> 00:32:15.660
It has all the same elements.

607
00:32:15.743 --> 00:32:17.787
It has the violence, it has the threats.

608
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:19.914
You know how it's similar
to a gangster rap?


609
00:32:19.998 --> 00:32:23.876
The American anthem is the only anthem
where you can put the word "bitch"


610
00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.837
at the end of any line

611
00:32:28.006 --> 00:32:30.008
and the song still makes sense.

612
00:32:32.885 --> 00:32:36.681
<i>♪ Gave proof through the night ♪</i>

613
00:32:36.764 --> 00:32:39.976
<i>♪ That our flag was still there ♪</i>

614
00:32:40.059 --> 00:32:41.144
<i>♪ Bitch ♪</i>

615
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.492
I love the American national anthem,
I won't lie.


616
00:32:57.201 --> 00:33:00.872
It's exciting, and I know all the words.
I didn't try, but I know them.


617
00:33:00.955 --> 00:33:03.666
It's one of those songs
that you hear so much that you know it.


618
00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:04.584
Sort of like

619
00:33:04.667 --> 00:33:06.419
<i>♪ Nationwide is on your side ♪</i>

620
00:33:06.502 --> 00:33:07.502
Same...

621
00:33:07.545 --> 00:33:10.673
Same thing. Don't wanna know that.
Don't need to know that.


622
00:33:10.757 --> 00:33:13.676
Wish I could reclaim the space
in my brain, but it's there.


623
00:33:15.094 --> 00:33:19.390
America's national anthem is like that,
'cause you hear it so much in America.


624
00:33:20.266 --> 00:33:23.144
Now, this is the only country
I've ever ever lived in


625
00:33:23.227 --> 00:33:25.021
where you play the national anthem

626
00:33:25.521 --> 00:33:27.732
when there is no other country
in attendance.


627
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:32.862
It would be like basketball games,

628
00:33:32.945 --> 00:33:33.988
football games,

629
00:33:34.072 --> 00:33:35.239
beer pong games,

630
00:33:35.323 --> 00:33:36.491
national anthem.

631
00:33:38.117 --> 00:33:41.579
Which I know is normal
if you've lived in America all your life.


632
00:33:41.662 --> 00:33:44.457
"What other way is there, Trevor?"
I'll tell you...


633
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.044
I'll tell you as somebody
who comes from the rest of the world,


634
00:33:49.879 --> 00:33:51.339
that's not a thing.

635
00:33:52.757 --> 00:33:54.509
It's not. Most places in the world,

636
00:33:54.592 --> 00:33:56.928
you play the national anthem
maybe once a year,


637
00:33:57.011 --> 00:33:59.097
on a national event,
or when you're competing


638
00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.265
against another country.
Then you play it.


639
00:34:01.349 --> 00:34:05.645
'Cause the other country is there
and you have to prove to your country


640
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.689
that you're loyal.
That's why you sing the song.


641
00:34:09.482 --> 00:34:11.442
'Cause countries are very insecure.

642
00:34:13.236 --> 00:34:14.570
You have to reassure them.

643
00:34:15.279 --> 00:34:16.405
Constantly reassuring.

644
00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:18.116
They should go to therapy,

645
00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:20.660
deal with their attachment issues,
but they don't.


646
00:34:21.327 --> 00:34:24.080
You only realize
how insecure countries are


647
00:34:24.163 --> 00:34:25.998
when you leave your country.

648
00:34:26.082 --> 00:34:27.458
Have you ever left and come back?

649
00:34:27.542 --> 00:34:29.394
Have you seen the questions
your country asks you?


650
00:34:29.418 --> 00:34:31.629
So insecure, so jealous.

651
00:34:31.712 --> 00:34:34.590
Just like, "Where have you been, huh?"

652
00:34:35.258 --> 00:34:37.385
"Where have you been? 
Which countries?"

653
00:34:37.468 --> 00:34:39.595
"So what? You have another country now?"

654
00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:41.973
"Is that what you're doing, huh? Huh?"

655
00:34:42.056 --> 00:34:45.685
"Which stamps are these? Let's see
who's been stamping your passport."


656
00:34:45.768 --> 00:34:48.771
You're like, "Damn, country.
Let me get my privacy."


657
00:34:52.483 --> 00:34:56.696
That's why you only sing the anthem
when there's another country attending.


658
00:34:56.779 --> 00:34:58.406
The only time you do it.

659
00:34:58.489 --> 00:35:01.117
That's what it's for,
to make your country feel good.


660
00:35:01.868 --> 00:35:02.785
All right?

661
00:35:02.869 --> 00:35:04.620
You know what national anthems are?

662
00:35:04.704 --> 00:35:10.751
National anthems are the geopolitical
equivalent of that thing women do


663
00:35:11.377 --> 00:35:12.420
to us men.

664
00:35:13.462 --> 00:35:17.258
Like, ladies, you know that trick
you have for that man in your life?


665
00:35:17.341 --> 00:35:20.178
Like, whenever his ego is bruised,

666
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.598
and you have to
you try and heal it.

667
00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.351
Every woman in this room has a trick

668
00:35:27.435 --> 00:35:29.145
that works on every man.

669
00:35:29.228 --> 00:35:33.065
And right now, I know a lot of the women
are like, "Shut up, Trevor!"


670
00:35:33.149 --> 00:35:35.818
"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!"

671
00:35:36.819 --> 00:35:38.946
It's a beautiful, subtle technique.

672
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.866
Yeah, you'll be out
having lunch or something,


673
00:35:41.949 --> 00:35:44.243
and some guy will
come up to the table.

674
00:35:44.327 --> 00:35:46.954
He's buff, works out,
you know, looks really good.


675
00:35:47.038 --> 00:35:49.749
He's like,
"Oh, my God, Michelle? Michelle?"


676
00:35:49.832 --> 00:35:52.919
Like, "Oh, Justin? Oh, my God."

677
00:35:53.002 --> 00:35:54.420
"Wow. How are you?"

678
00:35:54.503 --> 00:35:57.423
And you're like,
"Who the hell is Justin? What's going on?"


679
00:35:57.506 --> 00:36:00.509
He's like, "This is crazy.
Twice in two weeks?"


680
00:36:01.552 --> 00:36:05.056
And you go like, "Twice?
When was once? Who is this?"


681
00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:07.475
"I know. Oh, my God. How are you?"

682
00:36:07.558 --> 00:36:10.895
"I'm doing good. We gotta catch up.
We gotta talk about college."


683
00:36:10.978 --> 00:36:13.773
"I was thinking about it.
We were so crazy in college."


684
00:36:13.856 --> 00:36:15.691
"You remember that night?"

685
00:36:15.775 --> 00:36:18.152
"You went to college? 
What's going on?"

686
00:36:19.362 --> 00:36:23.658
She can feel your ego
slowly withering like a raisin in the sun.


687
00:36:25.576 --> 00:36:27.245
And she won't look at you.

688
00:36:27.328 --> 00:36:28.913
She won't make it a big thing.

689
00:36:28.996 --> 00:36:30.665
She'll continue the conversation.

690
00:36:30.748 --> 00:36:33.376
But they'll gently just
put their hand on your thigh.


691
00:36:34.627 --> 00:36:36.587
And then just start rubbing it.

692
00:36:37.672 --> 00:36:39.757
She'll carry on like nothing's happening.

693
00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.511
"I know, those were crazy. I was
a cheerleader. What are you gonna do?"


694
00:36:43.594 --> 00:36:45.972
"It's just one of those."
And the hand is going,


695
00:36:46.055 --> 00:36:48.266
"Shh. Shh, shh, shh."

696
00:36:49.308 --> 00:36:51.644
"Shh. It's okay. It's okay."

697
00:36:52.270 --> 00:36:55.106
"It's okay, you're a big man. Big man."

698
00:36:56.107 --> 00:36:58.526
"Strong man. That's right."

699
00:36:58.609 --> 00:37:02.863
"There's no other man in the world.
Just you. Look at you. Wow."


700
00:37:02.947 --> 00:37:04.657
"What a big man. Yeah."

701
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.076
"Who, this guy?
I don't even know who he is."


702
00:37:07.827 --> 00:37:09.453
"Yeah, no, with his muscles."

703
00:37:09.537 --> 00:37:11.163
"Oh, I don't like muscles, no."

704
00:37:11.831 --> 00:37:13.708
"I hate muscles. 
They're disgusting."

705
00:37:13.791 --> 00:37:18.045
"Look at him, all working out
and everything's in shape and bulging."


706
00:37:18.129 --> 00:37:19.255
"No, it's disgusting."

707
00:37:19.338 --> 00:37:22.091
"What, six-packs?
No, I don't want a six-pack."


708
00:37:22.174 --> 00:37:24.885
"I don't like six-packs.
That's why I like you." Boop!


709
00:37:30.975 --> 00:37:32.643
That's what a national anthem is.

710
00:37:40.443 --> 00:37:42.361
You reassuring your country.

711
00:37:45.406 --> 00:37:48.284
The American anthem
is such an interesting one. You know?


712
00:37:48.367 --> 00:37:51.162
Everything that represents America
is the anthem.


713
00:37:51.245 --> 00:37:54.290
America has the most fun
anthem rules in the world.


714
00:37:54.373 --> 00:37:58.210
Only country in the world
where you're allowed to sing the anthem


715
00:37:58.294 --> 00:37:59.712
however you want.

716
00:38:00.838 --> 00:38:03.341
However you want.

717
00:38:03.424 --> 00:38:05.134
You can't do that anywhere else.

718
00:38:05.217 --> 00:38:07.887
Everywhere else,
the anthem is the way it is written.


719
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:09.513
It's boring, and that's the point.

720
00:38:09.597 --> 00:38:10.848
You can't just change it.

721
00:38:10.931 --> 00:38:12.892
In America,
you can do whatever you please.


722
00:38:13.934 --> 00:38:15.394
I noticed it the first time.

723
00:38:15.478 --> 00:38:18.147
The first time I noticed it
was at a basketball game.


724
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:22.360
It was the New York Knicks
against the Toronto Raptors, right?


725
00:38:22.443 --> 00:38:25.029
And because the Raptors are from Canada,

726
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:30.743
they had to play two national anthems
before the game, which is rare.


727
00:38:31.744 --> 00:38:35.247
And so we're in the arena
and then the voice comes on.


728
00:38:35.331 --> 00:38:36.957
"Ladies and gentlemen,

729
00:38:37.041 --> 00:38:39.877
please stand
for the Canadian national anthem."


730
00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.379
And everybody stood,

731
00:38:42.296 --> 00:38:44.423
and then they just played,
like, a tape somewhere.


732
00:38:47.426 --> 00:38:49.095
You could tell they didn't care.

733
00:38:50.388 --> 00:38:53.224
And it was the song,
the Canadian song. It's always the same.


734
00:38:53.307 --> 00:38:55.893
<i>♪ O Canada... ♪</i>

735

737
00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.659
You know the song, man.
I don't have time for that. Whatever.


738
00:39:12.201 --> 00:39:13.869
They sang the Canadian anthem.

739
00:39:14.453 --> 00:39:15.453
They were done.

740
00:39:16.497 --> 00:39:17.706
The announcer came back,

741
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.417
"And now, ladies and gentlemen,

742
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:22.294
please stay standing
for the American national anthem."


743
00:39:23.087 --> 00:39:24.505
And that's my favorite part.

744
00:39:25.756 --> 00:39:27.425
Yeah, the lights will go dark.

745
00:39:29.218 --> 00:39:31.429
Someone walks to the middle of the arena.

746
00:39:32.138 --> 00:39:34.640
It's always so intense, complete silence.

Why are you trying to make
the anthem sexy? What are you doing?


753
00:40:59.642 --> 00:41:00.893
I never understand that.

754
00:41:00.976 --> 00:41:03.896
Why are you trying to
make it a sexy song?

755
00:41:08.526 --> 00:41:12.279
You'll never be in England
and see someone like, "Remix!"

Come on, save that Queen ♪</i>


760
00:41:27.211 --> 00:41:28.211
Oh, man.

761
00:41:37.513 --> 00:41:38.514
So, Germany was fun.

762
00:41:42.101 --> 00:41:47.106
And then we headed
to Paris, France, to do shows


763
00:41:47.731 --> 00:41:49.275
for the first time in my life,

764
00:41:49.358 --> 00:41:50.484
I was very excited.

765
00:41:50.568 --> 00:41:52.403
I always wanted to perform in Paris.

766
00:41:52.486 --> 00:41:54.905
Didn't know what it would be.
But can I tell you?


767
00:41:54.989 --> 00:41:57.908
Paris is everything they tell you it is.

768
00:41:57.992 --> 00:42:04.248
It is easily one of the most romantic
cities I have ever been to in my life.


769
00:42:04.331 --> 00:42:07.585
I fell in love 1,000 times.

770
00:42:08.335 --> 00:42:10.170
I was by myself. 
It didn't matter.

771
00:42:11.046 --> 00:42:11.964
Yeah.

772
00:42:12.047 --> 00:42:14.633
Every night, it was just me
and those bedbugs, baby.


773
00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:26.729
I really enjoyed Paris
because I got to meet Parisians.


774
00:42:27.438 --> 00:42:28.439
In person.

775
00:42:28.522 --> 00:42:30.899
Not stereotypes,
not things you're told about.


776
00:42:30.983 --> 00:42:34.945
No, actually meet French people,
learn about them from them.


777
00:42:35.029 --> 00:42:37.448
And I learned some truly amazing things.

778
00:42:37.531 --> 00:42:42.536
For instance, the French have
a very different relationship with work


779
00:42:43.245 --> 00:42:45.372
than the rest of us, all right?

780
00:42:45.456 --> 00:42:47.666
In that they don't
give a shit about it.

781
00:42:52.212 --> 00:42:54.506
Which, honestly, 
I found inspiring.

782
00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.050
Yeah. I feel like a lot of us

783
00:42:56.133 --> 00:42:58.927
have become a little
too attached to our work, you know?


784
00:42:59.011 --> 00:43:00.471
We identify with our work.

785
00:43:00.554 --> 00:43:03.223
Ever asked somebody like,
"Tell me about yourself"?


786
00:43:03.307 --> 00:43:04.850
"I'm an architect..."

787
00:43:04.933 --> 00:43:07.478
"Tell me about yourself."
"I own a hair salon and..."


788
00:43:07.561 --> 00:43:09.688
"Tell me about yourself."
"I'm a teacher..."


789
00:43:09.772 --> 00:43:11.065
"Tell me about yourself,"

790
00:43:11.148 --> 00:43:13.359
and people will tell you
about what they do.


791
00:43:13.442 --> 00:43:17.112
You know, it's become the thing
that people focus on.


792
00:43:17.196 --> 00:43:19.365
The French don't do that. No.

793
00:43:19.448 --> 00:43:21.909
You'll never meet
a French person who does that.


794
00:43:21.992 --> 00:43:25.120
You go up to a French person and be like,
"Excuse me. What do you do?"


795
00:43:25.204 --> 00:43:29.291
Be like, "Oh, me?
I go for walks with my friends and, uh...


796
00:43:29.375 --> 00:43:32.544
I like to eat good food and..."

797
00:43:32.628 --> 00:43:35.464
You're like, "No,
what do you do for a living?"


798
00:43:35.547 --> 00:43:37.257
"For a living? <i>Pardon."</i>

799
00:43:37.341 --> 00:43:38.467
"Okay, for a living."

800
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:41.220
"Okay, no, I, uh, breathe and, uh..."

801
00:43:42.137 --> 00:43:44.473
"You know, I drink water
and, uh, you know..."


802
00:43:44.556 --> 00:43:47.101
"Of course,
I have to make love, you know."


803
00:43:50.938 --> 00:43:53.649
It's just a different way to be, man.

804
00:43:53.732 --> 00:43:56.735
You know, not being
so attached to your work. It was lovely.


805
00:43:56.819 --> 00:44:02.032
I learned this because
when I flew to Paris, my luggage was lost.


806
00:44:02.741 --> 00:44:04.034
All right? Yeah.

807
00:44:04.118 --> 00:44:08.539
Landed in the airport,
and bags were gone, didn't arrive.


808
00:44:08.622 --> 00:44:10.833
I discovered this at the carousel,

809
00:44:10.916 --> 00:44:13.460
which is a shitty thing
that airlines do to you.


810
00:44:14.378 --> 00:44:16.130
They know your bags are not coming.

811
00:44:18.382 --> 00:44:21.051
Yeah, they know where your bag is
every single moment.


812
00:44:21.844 --> 00:44:23.053
But they don't tell you.

813
00:44:23.137 --> 00:44:25.222
They'll let you stand there like an idiot

814
00:44:25.931 --> 00:44:27.141
with hope in your heart.

815
00:44:29.059 --> 00:44:32.187
They could come to your seat
before take-off and be like,


816
00:44:32.271 --> 00:44:33.355
"It's not coming."

817
00:44:35.607 --> 00:44:37.151
"Spoiler alert."

818
00:44:38.694 --> 00:44:40.362
But they don't.

819
00:44:40.446 --> 00:44:43.532
They let you take off
with all that joy like an idiot.


820
00:44:43.615 --> 00:44:44.615
Whee!

821
00:44:45.617 --> 00:44:47.035
I landed in Paris.

822
00:44:47.119 --> 00:44:49.329
Thought it was
the beginning of a great trip.


823
00:44:49.413 --> 00:44:52.124
I was skipping around.
I had my full-luggage swag,


824
00:44:52.207 --> 00:44:53.834
"I'm going get my bags,

825
00:44:53.917 --> 00:44:55.752
go into Paris, start exploring."

826
00:44:55.836 --> 00:44:57.296
Got to the carousel. I was like,

827
00:44:57.379 --> 00:44:59.256
"Mmm-mmm, full luggage swag."

828
00:44:59.339 --> 00:45:01.842
"That's right.
Let me get my luggage, everybody."


829
00:45:01.925 --> 00:45:03.677
I was like, "Excuse me."

830
00:45:03.802 --> 00:45:04.887
"Make space, please."

831
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:06.972
"I would like to lean over the carousel."

832
00:45:07.055 --> 00:45:08.432
"Makes the bags come quicker."

833
00:45:08.515 --> 00:45:10.058
"Come on, lucky bag."

834
00:45:14.855 --> 00:45:16.899
I had full luggage swag.

835
00:45:16.982 --> 00:45:20.068
Bags started coming out
and I was standing there, judging them.


836
00:45:20.152 --> 00:45:22.279
"Ha-ha! Who still uses Samsonite?"

837
00:45:24.239 --> 00:45:25.866
"Ah! Where's my bag?"

838
00:45:25.949 --> 00:45:28.035
Bags going around, going around,

839
00:45:28.118 --> 00:45:30.120
and then new bags stopped coming out.

840
00:45:30.204 --> 00:45:31.455
I started worrying.

841
00:45:32.581 --> 00:45:34.666
Then there were fewer and fewer bags.

842
00:45:35.209 --> 00:45:36.460
And I was like, "Oh, my bag..."

843
00:45:37.419 --> 00:45:38.545
"My bag's not coming."

844
00:45:39.922 --> 00:45:43.217
And I realized my bag hadn't arrived.

845
00:45:44.676 --> 00:45:47.054
It was terrible. 
I had the same feeling,

846
00:45:47.137 --> 00:45:48.889
the same feeling I had as a child

847
00:45:49.556 --> 00:45:51.558
when my mom would forget me at school.

848
00:45:52.935 --> 00:45:53.977
Exactly the same.

849
00:45:54.061 --> 00:45:57.439
Standing at the carousel, felt like
I was ten years old again, like...


850
00:46:02.027 --> 00:46:05.781
"No, Mr. Wilkinson,
it's fine, you can go."


851
00:46:05.864 --> 00:46:08.575
"My mom's going to come.
Don't worry, you can go home."


852
00:46:08.659 --> 00:46:11.578
"She's coming. 
She wouldn't forget me."

853
00:46:11.662 --> 00:46:13.205
"No... She's..."

854
00:46:13.288 --> 00:46:15.832
"She's probably dead somewhere right now."

855
00:46:15.916 --> 00:46:19.211
"She's probably in a ditch lying dead."

856
00:46:22.297 --> 00:46:24.091
She forgot me.

857
00:46:25.092 --> 00:46:26.885
She'd forget me occasionally.

858
00:46:26.969 --> 00:46:28.679
And then I'd have to walk home.

859
00:46:28.762 --> 00:46:30.055
It was like an hour walk.

860
00:46:30.639 --> 00:46:32.516
And I'd get home,

861
00:46:32.599 --> 00:46:35.018
and she'd always have
the same reaction when I walked in,


862
00:46:35.102 --> 00:46:36.520
'cause she worked from home.

863
00:46:36.603 --> 00:46:39.231
She'd have a little computer
where she'd be typing away,


864
00:46:39.314 --> 00:46:41.900
and I'd walk into the house
and I'll close the door like...


865
00:46:41.984 --> 00:46:44.403
Always the same reaction, she'll be like...

866
00:46:45.571 --> 00:46:49.032
"No, no, no, no, no, baby, no!
No, no, no, no! Oh!"


867
00:46:49.116 --> 00:46:50.158
"What time is it?"

868
00:46:50.242 --> 00:46:52.869
And I'll be like, "It's too late."

869
00:46:58.333 --> 00:47:01.587
I'm not going to lie.
I hated being forgotten at school,


870
00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:03.380
but I savored those moments.

871
00:47:04.131 --> 00:47:07.926
'Cause it wasn't any sweat,
to be honest. I liked walking.


872
00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:10.429
It's not like I
was stressed on the walk.

873
00:47:11.096 --> 00:47:13.473
I'd be kicking stones,
singing on the way back.


874
00:47:13.557 --> 00:47:16.810
I'd get to the house
and be like, "No, wait a minute. Hmm."


875
00:47:18.604 --> 00:47:20.314
I loved it 'cause
that was the one moment

876
00:47:20.397 --> 00:47:23.817
when I was allowed to give my mom
unlimited attitude with no repercussions.


877
00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.027
None.

878
00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:26.361
'Cause when I was a kid,

879
00:47:26.445 --> 00:47:28.739
you couldn't give attitude
to your parents.


880
00:47:28.822 --> 00:47:31.867
I wasn't a white child.
You know what I mean? You couldn't...


881
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:33.160
I had to watch myself.

882
00:47:34.411 --> 00:47:36.413
But when she messed
up, ooh, I loved it.

883
00:47:36.496 --> 00:47:38.206
She'd be like, "Can you forgive me, baby?"

884
00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:40.125
I'll be like, "I'll think about it."

885
00:47:44.838 --> 00:47:47.215
Now I had to
find somebody to help me.

886
00:47:47.799 --> 00:47:49.009
I look around,

887
00:47:49.092 --> 00:47:51.887
there's an older
French gentleman standing on the side,


888
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.805
gray hair, rosy cheeks,

889
00:47:53.889 --> 00:47:55.515
short little guy with glasses.

890
00:47:55.599 --> 00:47:57.100
So I walked over to him.

891
00:47:57.184 --> 00:47:58.727
And he was wearing a red vest.

892
00:47:59.269 --> 00:48:01.897
And in French, it read <i>"Information,"</i>

893
00:48:02.564 --> 00:48:04.107
and then underneath in English

894
00:48:04.191 --> 00:48:05.400
said, "Information."

895
00:48:06.818 --> 00:48:08.111
I was like, "Phew!"

896
00:48:10.781 --> 00:48:13.200
"Ah. <i>Bonjour.</i> Hello. Hi."

897
00:48:13.283 --> 00:48:15.494
He's like, "Hello. <i>Bonjour."</i>

898
00:48:15.577 --> 00:48:17.537
I said, "English, French?"

899
00:48:17.621 --> 00:48:19.122
Said, "English, yeah, <i>oui."</i>

900
00:48:19.206 --> 00:48:21.291
I said, "Could you help me, please?"

901
00:48:21.375 --> 00:48:24.002
"Um... My, um...
My luggage didn't arrive."


902
00:48:24.086 --> 00:48:26.838
"Um, I would like to know,
what do I need to do?"


903
00:48:26.922 --> 00:48:29.758
He's like, "There's your luggage...
It didn't come..."


904
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.201
I was like, "Okay." Um...

905
00:48:56.284 --> 00:48:57.284
"All right."

906
00:48:58.161 --> 00:48:59.413
"Let's try French."

907
00:49:01.748 --> 00:49:04.042
"Let's, uh, see what happens."

908
00:49:06.211 --> 00:49:08.171
Finally, we figured it out.

909
00:49:08.964 --> 00:49:12.551
He sent me off to a special area
where you go and make a report.


910
00:49:13.135 --> 00:49:16.430
There's another French guy
behind the counter, much younger.


911
00:49:16.513 --> 00:49:18.932
He was maybe Algerian
or Moroccan of descent.


912
00:49:19.015 --> 00:49:20.851
Very French, very French. Cool guy.

913
00:49:20.934 --> 00:49:22.060
He's helping somebody.

914
00:49:22.144 --> 00:49:24.104
"Okay, thank you very much. 
Next, please."

915
00:49:24.187 --> 00:49:25.313
I walk up, "Hey, man."

916
00:49:25.397 --> 00:49:27.399
He's like,
"What's going on, my brother?"


917
00:49:27.482 --> 00:49:29.317
"How are you? What's up with you?"

918
00:49:29.401 --> 00:49:31.361
I was like, "I need your help, please."

919
00:49:31.445 --> 00:49:35.323
"My luggage, um, it didn't come.
It's, uh, lost."


920
00:49:35.407 --> 00:49:38.410
He's like, "Oh, no, dude,
your luggage didn't come."


921
00:49:38.493 --> 00:49:39.828
"Oh, man."

922
00:49:39.911 --> 00:49:41.037
"Did you look for it?"

923
00:49:44.583 --> 00:49:47.127
I said, "What?
Yeah, that's the first thing I did."


924
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:48.920
"You think I'm here for company?"

925
00:49:49.004 --> 00:49:50.172
"Of course, that's..."

926
00:49:50.255 --> 00:49:51.840
He's like, "No. 
Just checking."

927
00:49:51.923 --> 00:49:53.884
"So, the bag is gone? 
It's totally..."

928
00:49:53.967 --> 00:49:54.843
I'm like, "Yeah."

929
00:49:54.926 --> 00:49:58.388
He's like, "Oh, man, that sucks, man,
I'm so sorry for you, man."


930
00:49:58.472 --> 00:49:59.598
"That's terrible."

931
00:50:00.182 --> 00:50:02.142
"Yeah. So, what do
you want to do now?"

932
00:50:04.811 --> 00:50:06.062
"What do I want to do?"

933
00:50:06.688 --> 00:50:10.859
I said, "I would like
you to do something."


934
00:50:10.942 --> 00:50:13.028
"Can we make a report or something?"

935
00:50:13.111 --> 00:50:15.697
"You want to make
some paperwork or something?"


936
00:50:15.781 --> 00:50:18.992
"It's for your for your insurance
so they can pay you for it?"


937
00:50:19.075 --> 00:50:22.370
I said, "No, it's so that
you can find it and bring it to me."


938
00:50:22.454 --> 00:50:24.498
He's like, "Oh, don't worry, man."

939
00:50:24.581 --> 00:50:26.082
"We are not going to find it."

940
00:50:26.166 --> 00:50:27.166
"No, man."

941
00:50:27.793 --> 00:50:29.127
"Don't worry about that."

942
00:50:29.211 --> 00:50:30.921
"No. You know, it's Paris, man."

943
00:50:31.004 --> 00:50:33.590
"When the bags are gone,
they're probably gone."


944
00:50:33.673 --> 00:50:36.426
"They don't ever pop up.
Sometimes, if you're lucky."


945
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:39.012
"But if it is not here by now,
it's probably gone."


946
00:50:39.095 --> 00:50:41.348
"It's Friday.
There are some strikes. Just..."


947
00:50:41.431 --> 00:50:44.351
"You can leave. Don't stress yourself.
You can go."


948
00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:46.937
It's like, "Don't even stress..."

949
00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:48.313
"Yo, It's my luggage."

950
00:50:48.939 --> 00:50:50.190
"That's all my clothes."

951
00:50:50.273 --> 00:50:52.150
He's like, "But you are in Paris."

952
00:50:52.234 --> 00:50:54.528
"You need clothes? 
This is Paris, man."

953
00:50:54.611 --> 00:50:56.738
"Come on, Paris, go and buy some clothes."

954
00:50:56.822 --> 00:50:58.824
"What's wrong with you, man? Chill."

955
00:50:59.407 --> 00:51:00.742
He was so confident,

956
00:51:01.618 --> 00:51:03.537
he made me feel like I was wrong.

957
00:51:04.871 --> 00:51:06.039
Like, I doubted myself.

958
00:51:06.122 --> 00:51:08.792
I walked away and I was like,
"Am I wrong?"


959
00:51:09.709 --> 00:51:11.503
"Am I too attached to my luggage?"

960
00:51:15.048 --> 00:51:17.884
He wasn't lying.
Paris has a great selection of clothing.


961
00:51:17.968 --> 00:51:19.511
I had to go and buy clothes

962
00:51:19.594 --> 00:51:21.763
because I had nothing
for my shows, for anything.


963
00:51:21.847 --> 00:51:24.683
And if you ever do go to Paris,
take some extra money


964
00:51:24.766 --> 00:51:26.977
for the clothes shopping. It's amazing.

965
00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:29.104
And try and also pack

966
00:51:29.187 --> 00:51:30.981
an extra pair of self-esteem.

967
00:51:32.774 --> 00:51:35.318
Yeah, you'll need it
when you shop with the French.


968
00:51:36.027 --> 00:51:38.154
'Cause they're not your friends.

969
00:51:38.238 --> 00:51:39.781
Yeah. I've never been to a country

970
00:51:39.865 --> 00:51:42.492
where you are truly on your own
when you're shopping.


971
00:51:42.576 --> 00:51:45.787
You walk into a store,
nobody helps you. Nothing.


972
00:51:45.871 --> 00:51:48.498
You don't know who works there,
who's doing anything.


973
00:51:48.582 --> 00:51:50.750
Literally, it's like <i>Undercover Employee.</i>

974
00:51:51.543 --> 00:51:53.420
Just walking around.

975
00:51:53.503 --> 00:51:55.380
It was 20 minutes, nobody helped me.

976
00:51:55.463 --> 00:51:57.257
Finally I started picking my own clothes,

977
00:51:57.340 --> 00:52:00.510
and I heard an annoyed voice behind me.
"Can I help you?"


978
00:52:01.094 --> 00:52:03.805
I was like, "Hi. Yes.
I need to get clothes, please."


979
00:52:03.889 --> 00:52:05.223
"My luggage was lost."

980
00:52:05.307 --> 00:52:07.183
And then, Detroit, I got roasted

981
00:52:08.602 --> 00:52:11.479
more than I've ever
been roasted in my life. Ever.


982
00:52:12.063 --> 00:52:14.816
Ever. Everything I chose

983
00:52:15.525 --> 00:52:16.985
came with a scathing review.

984
00:52:18.653 --> 00:52:21.781
I was like, "Yeah,
could I please, um, get this in a medium?"


985
00:52:21.865 --> 00:52:25.160
He was like, "Medium?
No, you mean large or extra-large, no?"


986
00:52:26.745 --> 00:52:28.997
"Yeah, no,
this one is medium for your body?"


987
00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:30.373
"I don't think so, no?"

988
00:52:31.333 --> 00:52:32.834
I was like, "I'm sorry, what?"

989
00:52:32.918 --> 00:52:36.046
He's like, "I think you're a large.
I can bring that one for you."


990
00:52:36.129 --> 00:52:38.256
"Medium is too much for the shirt, okay?"

991
00:52:39.507 --> 00:52:41.092
I'm like, "What?"

992
00:52:41.176 --> 00:52:42.719
Yo, everything, everything.

993
00:52:43.303 --> 00:52:45.096
There was a jacket I wanted to buy.

994
00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:46.306
"Could I get this?"

995
00:52:46.389 --> 00:52:49.267
He's like, "No, this one
for your skin tone is not great."


996
00:52:49.351 --> 00:52:52.938
"No, You have to think about
what is complementary for the colors


997
00:52:53.021 --> 00:52:54.230
inside the fabric

998
00:52:54.314 --> 00:52:56.149
and also inside your face, okay?"

999
00:52:56.733 --> 00:52:58.610
"This one is not the best."

1000
00:52:58.693 --> 00:53:01.696
I was like, "Yo,
I already own something like this."


1001
00:53:01.780 --> 00:53:03.782
He's like, "Ah, and you're wearing it?"

1002
00:53:06.826 --> 00:53:07.911
"Well, not anymore."

1003
00:53:09.371 --> 00:53:11.164
"No, you can wear it if you want."

1004
00:53:11.247 --> 00:53:12.749
<i>"C'est tranquille.</i> Go ahead."

1005
00:53:12.832 --> 00:53:14.626
"No, you threatened me now."

1006
00:53:17.671 --> 00:53:20.090
You know what? 
It's just different.

1007
00:53:20.799 --> 00:53:24.052
A friend said to me,
"Dude, the French are assholes, right?"


1008
00:53:24.135 --> 00:53:26.304
I was like,
"I don't think that they're assholes."


1009
00:53:26.388 --> 00:53:28.515
"I think they're just very honest."

1010
00:53:29.057 --> 00:53:29.891
All right?

1011
00:53:29.975 --> 00:53:32.394
It's hard to tell
the difference between the two.


1012
00:53:34.062 --> 00:53:38.692
'Cause one day
I was speaking to a French woman


1013
00:53:38.775 --> 00:53:41.778
and I worked up
the courage to ask her,

1014
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:43.780
I said, "Hey, um..."

1015
00:53:45.115 --> 00:53:47.075
"Why are the French...

1016
00:53:48.034 --> 00:53:49.160
like this?"

1017
00:53:51.538 --> 00:53:53.206
And she said, "What do you mean?"

1018
00:53:53.289 --> 00:53:54.624
I said, "When you're in a store,

1019
00:53:54.708 --> 00:53:55.834
they seem very mean."

1020
00:53:55.917 --> 00:53:59.337
"No, they're not being mean.
They're just being themselves, no?"


1021
00:53:59.421 --> 00:54:03.299
"Maybe because you are used to
coming in a country where people,


1022
00:54:03.383 --> 00:54:06.052
they are so afraid
that you're not going to tip them,


1023
00:54:06.136 --> 00:54:07.887
that they are all on top of you."

1024
00:54:07.971 --> 00:54:09.472
"'Can I help you? 
Can I help you?'"

1025
00:54:09.556 --> 00:54:12.809
"But in France, we make sure
that everybody is getting a good salary."


1026
00:54:12.892 --> 00:54:13.768
"A good wage."

1027
00:54:13.852 --> 00:54:16.354
"So we are not,
you know, so stressed about that."


1028
00:54:16.438 --> 00:54:18.857
"In America, it's like,
'The customer is king.'"


1029
00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:21.192
"But in France,
you know what we do to kings."


1030
00:54:21.276 --> 00:54:22.276
"So, you know..."

1031
00:54:23.361 --> 00:54:24.612
"It's not the same here."

1032
00:54:30.952 --> 00:54:32.620
The French don't play that game.

1033
00:54:34.289 --> 00:54:36.332
You've been
so much fun tonight, Detroit.


1034
00:54:36.416 --> 00:54:37.542
Thank you.

1035
00:54:41.504 --> 00:54:42.547
Thank you so much.

1036
00:54:44.215 --> 00:54:45.550
Proved me right.

1037
00:54:45.633 --> 00:54:47.844
This is why you go to Detroit.

1038
00:54:47.927 --> 00:54:49.971
For real. It's an amazing audience.

1039
00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.725
Beautiful, diverse.

1040
00:54:56.644 --> 00:54:58.146
And the city's been cool, too.

1041
00:54:58.229 --> 00:55:00.482
We've been seeing
a few things here and there.


1042
00:55:00.565 --> 00:55:02.859
I had a fight with my friend Dave.

1043
00:55:02.942 --> 00:55:04.944
He directs these specials

1044
00:55:05.612 --> 00:55:07.405
and he said to me one day,

1045
00:55:07.489 --> 00:55:09.657
"Yo, what are you doing during the day?"

1046
00:55:09.741 --> 00:55:11.785
And I was, "Might go eat, do something."

1047
00:55:11.868 --> 00:55:15.288
He's like, "Dude, why don't we go
check out all the museums in Detroit?"


1048
00:55:15.371 --> 00:55:17.040
I was like, "Maybe like one."

1049
00:55:18.625 --> 00:55:20.001
He said, "What do you mean, one?"

1050
00:55:20.085 --> 00:55:22.253
I was like, "Yeah, not all.
What do you mean, all?"


1051
00:55:22.337 --> 00:55:24.798
He's like, "Dude,
have you been here before?"


1052
00:55:24.881 --> 00:55:27.050
"You know how many
amazing museums they got?"


1053
00:55:27.133 --> 00:55:29.177
"Yes, but it's still a museum."

1054
00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.054
"I'll do like one, and that's it."

1055
00:55:32.764 --> 00:55:35.809
"I don't have that much stamina.
I can't do as many as you."


1056
00:55:35.892 --> 00:55:38.728
"What do you mean
you can't do as many as me?"


1057
00:55:38.812 --> 00:55:41.689
"Dude, because you're white,
like, you enjoy doing that."


1058
00:55:43.066 --> 00:55:45.318
And I was just joking.
I was just teasing him.


1059
00:55:45.401 --> 00:55:46.402
Just teasing him.

1060
00:55:46.486 --> 00:55:48.947
He got so offended so quickly, right?

1061
00:55:49.489 --> 00:55:51.366
He's like, "What did you say?"

1062
00:55:52.951 --> 00:55:53.952
"Because you're..."

1063
00:55:54.035 --> 00:55:56.621
He's like, "Dude,
white people don't love museums."


1064
00:55:56.704 --> 00:55:58.790
"What are you even talking about?"

1065
00:55:58.873 --> 00:56:03.670
"Like, museums aren't even in the top
five things white people love, okay?"


1066
00:56:05.004 --> 00:56:07.549
He said it with such confidence.

1067
00:56:08.466 --> 00:56:10.343
and with such conviction,

1068
00:56:10.426 --> 00:56:12.262
I was like, "What is the top five?"

1069
00:56:13.429 --> 00:56:16.266
'Cause what a strange...
"That's not even in the top five."


1070
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:19.185
Like, in his bedroom,
he has a list on the wall


1071
00:56:19.269 --> 00:56:20.770
of the top ten things.

1072
00:56:20.854 --> 00:56:22.188
It was amazing.

1073
00:56:23.481 --> 00:56:25.650
I thought about it.
I was like, "No, it is."


1074
00:56:25.733 --> 00:56:27.152
"I stick with my decision."

1075
00:56:27.235 --> 00:56:28.111
Museums would be.

1076
00:56:28.194 --> 00:56:29.863
'Cause, no, it's not even a bad thing.

1077
00:56:29.946 --> 00:56:31.281
White people love museums.

1078
00:56:32.073 --> 00:56:33.741
A lot of people enjoy museums,

1079
00:56:33.825 --> 00:56:37.620
but white people love museums.

1080
00:56:37.704 --> 00:56:38.913
Love museums.

1081
00:56:38.997 --> 00:56:40.748
There's not a single place on Earth

1082
00:56:40.832 --> 00:56:43.168
where white people have settled
and not built a museum.


1083
00:56:43.251 --> 00:56:45.795
It doesn't matter.
White people love museums.


1084
00:56:45.879 --> 00:56:47.797
You ever seen
white people in a museum?


1085
00:56:47.881 --> 00:56:50.758
Walking around smiling
with their hands behind their back?


1086
00:56:57.432 --> 00:56:58.975
"Yep, that was us."

1087
00:57:00.435 --> 00:57:01.769
"That was us, too."

1088
00:57:03.021 --> 00:57:04.522
"It's been a good run."

1089
00:57:06.107 --> 00:57:08.151
White people love museums.

1090
00:57:08.651 --> 00:57:11.654
I wouldn't put it at number one,
but it'd be in the top five.


1091
00:57:12.197 --> 00:57:13.197
I thought about it.

1092
00:57:13.239 --> 00:57:15.325
If there were
top five things white people love,


1093
00:57:15.408 --> 00:57:17.243
I'd put museums at number five.

1094
00:57:17.327 --> 00:57:20.413
At number four,
I'd put swimming. All right?


1095
00:57:20.496 --> 00:57:22.207
'Cause white people love swimming.

1096
00:57:22.290 --> 00:57:24.751
Nothing wrong with that.
Have you seen white people swim?


1097
00:57:24.834 --> 00:57:26.252
You look stunning.

1098
00:57:26.336 --> 00:57:27.629
Stunning.

1099
00:57:27.712 --> 00:57:30.131
When white people swim,
you do that thing with your hair.


1100
00:57:30.215 --> 00:57:31.575
You come out of the water, like...

1101
00:57:33.468 --> 00:57:35.386
Just go perfectly back like a duck.

1102
00:57:37.931 --> 00:57:39.307
I would love swimming, too.

1103
00:57:40.016 --> 00:57:41.601
White people love swimming.

1104
00:57:41.684 --> 00:57:44.062
White people love swimming so much,

1105
00:57:44.145 --> 00:57:46.397
that they made it
that you can win more medals


1106
00:57:46.481 --> 00:57:48.358
at the Olympics, swimming,

1107
00:57:48.441 --> 00:57:49.776
than any other discipline.

1108
00:57:51.277 --> 00:57:53.821
Yeah, that's how much
white people love swimming.


1109
00:57:54.322 --> 00:57:55.532
I realized this one day.

1110
00:57:55.615 --> 00:57:59.244
There was an argument going on about
who the greatest Olympian of all time is.


1111
00:57:59.327 --> 00:58:02.163
And the final two was Michael Phelps

1112
00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:03.998
and Usain Bolt.

1113
00:58:04.582 --> 00:58:06.209
And then one of the arguments was,

1114
00:58:06.292 --> 00:58:09.254
"Well, Michael Phelps is better
because he has more medals."


1115
00:58:09.337 --> 00:58:11.548
And I was like,
"Yeah, because he cheated."


1116
00:58:12.215 --> 00:58:13.883
"He won them swimming."

1117
00:58:14.968 --> 00:58:16.761
I'm not saying
Michael Phelps is not great.


1118
00:58:16.844 --> 00:58:19.264
I'm saying you can't count
the medals in the argument.


1119
00:58:19.347 --> 00:58:21.558
Because in swimming
it's the only discipline


1120
00:58:21.641 --> 00:58:23.768
where you win more medals
for doing the same thing


1121
00:58:23.851 --> 00:58:26.187
in a slightly less efficient manner.

1122
00:58:27.438 --> 00:58:28.523
It makes no sense.

1123
00:58:29.857 --> 00:58:32.777
Think about it. It's like,
"100-meter freestyle."


1124
00:58:37.407 --> 00:58:38.449
Done. Gold medal.

1125
00:58:38.533 --> 00:58:40.034
Yeah. And now this.

1126
00:58:46.124 --> 00:58:47.250
Another medal. Yeah.

1127
00:58:47.333 --> 00:58:48.333
And this one?

1128
00:58:54.382 --> 00:58:56.551
Another medal. 
But what about this one?

1129
00:59:01.472 --> 00:59:02.307
Another medal.

1130
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:04.976
That's some bullshit.
I don't care what anyone says.


1131
00:59:05.935 --> 00:59:07.979
You can't win more medals.

1132
00:59:10.898 --> 00:59:13.067
Usain Bolt doesn't have that luxury.

1133
00:59:13.901 --> 00:59:16.738
When Usain Bolt runs,
it's the 100-meter and it's done.


1134
00:59:16.821 --> 00:59:18.323
"On your marks, set..."

1135
00:59:18.406 --> 00:59:19.866
Run, run, run, run.

1136
00:59:19.949 --> 00:59:22.076
Get to the end, win, gold medal.

1137
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.160
That's it.

1138
00:59:23.202 --> 00:59:24.537
He can't turn around like,

1139
00:59:24.621 --> 00:59:27.832
"Amazing race. And now
I'm going to do it butterfly style."


1140
00:59:35.506 --> 00:59:36.633
It's not a thing.

1141
00:59:38.468 --> 00:59:40.678
I mean, it should be, but it's not.

1142
00:59:44.974 --> 00:59:48.102
White people love swimming,
so they made up the rule. I get it.


1143
00:59:49.228 --> 00:59:51.064
It would have to be, yeah.

1144
00:59:51.147 --> 00:59:54.067
Of my top five things,
I'd go museums at number five,


1145
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:55.860
swimming at number four.

1146
00:59:55.943 --> 00:59:57.153
Number three,

1147
00:59:57.236 --> 00:59:58.446
being flabbergasted.

1148
01:00:00.448 --> 01:00:03.076
White people love
being flabbergasted. Come on.


1149
01:00:03.159 --> 01:00:05.244
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

1150
01:00:05.828 --> 01:00:08.706
Have you ever seen
when a white person's having a bad day,


1151
01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:09.999
something's gone wrong,

1152
01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:13.044
they do that thing with their face,
get flabbergasted like...


1153
01:00:23.638 --> 01:00:25.556
White people love being flabbergasted.

1154
01:00:26.474 --> 01:00:28.601
You'll see it
in supermarkets all the time.


1155
01:00:28.685 --> 01:00:30.812
There's like a long line. All right?

1156
01:00:31.354 --> 01:00:33.481
But only one cashier is open.

1157
01:00:34.357 --> 01:00:35.566
Everyone's standing patiently.

1158
01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:38.403
There's always
one white person who pops out like...


1159
01:00:42.824 --> 01:00:45.159
"Why don't they open the other..."

1160
01:00:45.243 --> 01:00:46.494
"Are you serious?"

1161
01:00:46.577 --> 01:00:48.663
"What are they... Are you..."

1162
01:00:49.956 --> 01:00:51.833
The only thing white people love more

1163
01:00:51.916 --> 01:00:54.210
is finding another
white person to flabbergast with.


1164
01:00:54.293 --> 01:00:55.293
Have you seen that?

1165
01:00:57.338 --> 01:00:59.465
Yo, whenever that happens, magic.

1166
01:00:59.549 --> 01:01:01.217
It is absolute magic.

1167
01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:03.594
A white person will be flabbergasting.

1168
01:01:03.678 --> 01:01:05.763
They'll make eye contact
with another white person,


1169
01:01:05.847 --> 01:01:07.765
and then they'll flabbergast together.

1170
01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:11.269
It's like they Voltron their
flabbergasting into a super flabbergast.


1171
01:01:11.352 --> 01:01:13.813
You see them look over. "You see this?"

1172
01:01:13.896 --> 01:01:14.896
"I know."

1173
01:01:22.697 --> 01:01:24.782
That's one of the keys to flabbergasting.

1174
01:01:24.866 --> 01:01:26.743
You have to exhale. 
Let it all out.

1175
01:01:26.826 --> 01:01:29.120
Life is so hard
that the air has to leave your body.


1176
01:01:29.203 --> 01:01:30.788
You can no longer even breathe.

1177
01:01:33.916 --> 01:01:36.502
That's why there's
so many tornadoes in the Midwest.


1178
01:01:36.586 --> 01:01:38.504
It's just white people flabbergasting...

1179
01:01:47.221 --> 01:01:49.599
White people love being flabbergasted.

1180
01:01:50.725 --> 01:01:52.727
Has to be. Has to be top five.

1181
01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:55.271
That would be my list.
Top five things white people love.


1182
01:01:55.354 --> 01:01:56.856
I've got museums at number five.

1183
01:01:56.939 --> 01:01:59.233
All right, swimming at number four.

1184
01:01:59.317 --> 01:02:01.402
Being flabbergasted, number three.

1185
01:02:01.486 --> 01:02:03.029
Number two, being white.

1186
01:02:04.614 --> 01:02:06.574
It's a sweet gig. 
I don't blame you.

1187
01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:09.327
And then there's number one.

1188
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:12.872
And look, this is my personal list.
I'm not dictating anything.


1189
01:02:12.955 --> 01:02:15.333
If you don't agree, make your own, right?

1190
01:02:15.416 --> 01:02:17.126
It's a personal preference.

1191
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:18.669
But there is one thing,

1192
01:02:19.337 --> 01:02:20.505
and one thing alone,

1193
01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:26.010
that white people love
more than anything on this planet.


1194
01:02:28.221 --> 01:02:29.639
"Sweet Caroline."

1195
01:02:37.730 --> 01:02:39.482
Let me tell you something, Detroit.

1196
01:02:39.565 --> 01:02:43.027
There is nothing that brings more joy

1197
01:02:44.195 --> 01:02:45.905
to the soul of a white person

1198
01:02:46.906 --> 01:02:49.033
than the sounds of that Neil Diamond song.

1199
01:02:51.744 --> 01:02:53.579
I don't care where it is.

1200
01:02:53.663 --> 01:02:55.832
I've been on every continent,

1201
01:02:55.915 --> 01:02:57.083
in many countries.

1202
01:02:57.166 --> 01:02:59.210
When that song plays,

1203
01:02:59.293 --> 01:03:02.255
you see white people's eyes light up...

1204
01:03:05.007 --> 01:03:07.510
like sleeper agents
who've just been activated.


1205
01:03:11.389 --> 01:03:13.266
It happens every time, without fail.

1206
01:03:13.349 --> 01:03:15.393
Every single time.

1207
01:03:16.269 --> 01:03:18.938
It's not about music,
other songs will be playing.


1208
01:03:19.021 --> 01:03:21.816
They'll be at a cookout
or a baseball game,


1209
01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:23.526
a company event.

1210
01:03:23.609 --> 01:03:26.612
All the other songs are in the background.
They pay them no heed.


1211
01:03:26.696 --> 01:03:28.948
But when that song kicks in,

1212
01:03:29.031 --> 01:03:31.492
it taps into the very DNA of whiteness.

1213
01:03:31.576 --> 01:03:33.035
I don't know what it is.

1214
01:03:34.078 --> 01:03:35.997
But it interrupts everything else.

1215
01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.124
You'll see white people hanging out.

1216
01:03:38.207 --> 01:03:39.458
They'll be like, "Yeah,

1217
01:03:39.542 --> 01:03:41.377
business, mergers and acquisitions."

1218
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:42.795
"It's one of those things."

1219
01:03:42.879 --> 01:03:44.505
"I know, we should circle back."

1220
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:47.049
"Let's put a pin in it."

1221
01:03:48.885 --> 01:03:50.720
And that song comes in,

1222
01:03:50.803 --> 01:03:52.346
and every single time...

1223
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:54.932
You think it won't happen.
It always creeps in.


1224
01:03:55.016 --> 01:03:57.435
It always seems like it won't happen.

1225
01:03:57.518 --> 01:03:59.395
But it's always the same, just like...

01:04:25.796 --> 01:04:27.673
I didn't say, "All together now."

1232
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:30.051
Or, "On the count of three."

1233
01:04:30.134 --> 01:04:32.136
That was just your whiteness coming out.

1234
01:04:32.219 --> 01:04:33.304
Did you feel that?

1235
01:04:34.263 --> 01:04:35.097
Huh?

1236
01:04:35.181 --> 01:04:37.767
That was just you.
You were like, "This is it!"


1237
01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:39.685
"This is our moment!"

Look at you right now.
You're beaming! Look at your face.


1242
01:04:51.781 --> 01:04:53.658
Look at you. Look at that joy.

1243
01:04:53.741 --> 01:04:56.077
Ten minutes ago,
"I don't know about this guy."


1244
01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.329
Now you're like, "Best comedian ever!"

1245
01:05:00.498 --> 01:05:01.999
Don't ever lose that joy.

1246
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:04.043
None of you white people.

1247
01:05:04.126 --> 01:05:06.379
You hold on to it. 
It is a treasure.

1248
01:05:06.462 --> 01:05:08.881
It is the most
adorable thing in the world.


1249
01:05:09.924 --> 01:05:12.927
Nothing makes white people
happier than that song. Nothing.


1250
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.763
That song is pure, uncut Caucasian joy.

1251
01:05:15.846 --> 01:05:17.473
That's what that song is.

1252
01:05:19.225 --> 01:05:20.935
White people cannot resist it.

1253
01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:23.771
Yeah, forget 23andMe.

1254
01:05:23.854 --> 01:05:26.440
If you want to know
how much white you have in you,


1255
01:05:26.524 --> 01:05:27.692
play that song.

1256
01:05:27.775 --> 01:05:29.944
The louder you respond,
the whiter you are.


1257
01:05:30.486 --> 01:05:31.904
I just saved you some money.

1258
01:05:33.406 --> 01:05:35.533
There's no white person I've seen...

1259
01:05:35.616 --> 01:05:38.327
It is the Marco to your Polo.
That's what that song is.


1260
01:05:39.203 --> 01:05:40.121
I'll tell you,

1261
01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:43.207
if there was ever, like,
a giant earthquake, God forbid,


1262
01:05:43.290 --> 01:05:45.459
and people were
trapped beneath the rubble,


1263
01:05:47.211 --> 01:05:49.380
I'd volunteer to find
all the white people.


1264
01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:52.800
I'll be like,
"You guys find everybody else."

"Trevor, we like that song,
but it's not the most important to us."


1271

Yeah? Then how come
you didn't help me sing the anthem?
