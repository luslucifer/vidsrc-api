Granfer?

15
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.875
- Yeah?
- Can I come out on the boat with you?


16
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.666
You got school today, my love.
Lessons to learn.


17
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.166
They can't teach me
how to bait a lobster pot.


18
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.916
I think your mother might use me as bait
if I let you play hooky.


19
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.375
Now, here.

20
00:02:04.458 --> 00:02:06.458
I'll take you out on Saturday. All right?

21
00:02:07.125 --> 00:02:08.125
Go on.

22
00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.250
<i>What the bloody hell's
going on down here, Jago?</i>


23
00:02:17.041 --> 00:02:20.166
I can't find her.

24
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.500
A grown man... wandering around...

25
00:02:25.416 --> 00:02:28.541
with a pixie in his pocket
needs his head examining.


26
00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:31.833
Hey, you won't say that when
I'm dragged down to Davy Jones' locker.


27
00:02:31.916 --> 00:02:34.250
Well, at least
I'll get a decent night's sleep. Here!


28
00:02:38.416 --> 00:02:41.833
Have a good day, my darlin' maid.

29
00:02:42.666 --> 00:02:44.458
'Tis still the middle
of the bleedin' night.


30
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:46.625
- Ahh.
- Oh, no!


31
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.340
Here, let me give you a hand with that,
Father.


32
00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:57.666
All set, Jim.

33
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.875
Good lad.

34
00:03:00.291 --> 00:03:03.958
Here he is, just like clockwork.
Turns up when all the work's done.


35
00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:07.708
- What time do you call this then?
- Ungodly!


36
00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.540
<i>Here. Dad and I
found another song last night.</i>


37
00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:15.583
- Yeah?
- Yeah.


38
00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:17.750
- What's that, then?
- "Nelson's Blood."


39
00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:20.791
- Love song, is it?
- Oh, no. Not quite.


40
00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:24.458
So, apparently,
at the Battle of Trafalgar,


41
00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:29.666
they had to put Lord Nelson's corpse
in a big, bloody barrel of brandy.


42
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.166
What did they use? 
Martell or Courvoisier?

43
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.041
A big word for
this time of day, innit?

44
00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.458
Well, how's the song go, then?

45
00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:40.750

What's going on?

60
00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:45.809
It's going straight to voice mail.

61
00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:48.500
- Let's just leave without him.
- Totally. You snooze, you lose.


62
00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:50.684
There is no way he's getting out
of your stag do that easy.


63
00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:56.333
Yeah.

64
00:04:56.416 --> 00:04:57.625
<i>I'm on my way, Troy.</i>

65
00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:03.958
See, what I don't get,
is why a smart-arse lawyer


66
00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:05.500
wouldn't insist on a prenup.

67
00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:07.125
It's called trust, Danny.

68
00:05:07.208 --> 00:05:09.458
Is that why Abigail
didn't trust you to go to Vegas?


69
00:05:09.541 --> 00:05:12.000
She did. She just didn't trust you guys
to take care of me.


70
00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:15.833
No, sailing a yacht
out into the wide blue yonder.


71
00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:17.125
That's much more of a buzz.

72
00:05:17.208 --> 00:05:18.368
If you ever hear me say that,

73
00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:21.458
fly me to Switzerland and check me
into the euthanasia clinic, pronto.


74
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:23.333
With pleasure, mate.

75
00:05:23.416 --> 00:05:26.136
You're just cynical because
you've not met the right girl yet, Danny.


76
00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:29.583
No. It's because monogamy...
It isn't natural.


77
00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:31.583
That is... That is right. 
That is right.

78
00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:33.708
In mammals,
it is practically non-existent.


79
00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:36.541
What about penguins?

80
00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:38.976
They mate for life. I saw it
on a documentary on <i>Animal Planet.</i>


81
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.458
Penguins live on the South Pole, Henry,
where it's a hundred below zero.


82
00:05:42.541 --> 00:05:45.541
No way they're gonna get their
crown jewels out for a bit on the side.


83
00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:48.916
For them, monogamy is all about
keeping their bollocks warm.

- Yup.


91
00:06:16.958 --> 00:06:19.333
- Two times two.
- Four.


92
00:06:19.416 --> 00:06:21.375

- Nine.

Stop repeating yourself, woman!

95
00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:30.392
Henry, you better get used to it.
That's what marriage sounds like.


96
00:06:30.416 --> 00:06:32.750
- Four times four?
- Sixteen.

- Mmm.


98
00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:39.125
Hey.

99
00:06:39.208 --> 00:06:41.768
- You have to reverse.
- You gonna have to back up, mate.


100
00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:44.916
- Any damage is coming out of your bonus.
- No pressure, mate.


101
00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:48.583
One of you's gonna have to get out
and help me. Please?


102
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.916
I'll deal with it.

103
00:06:57.541 --> 00:06:58.583
Sorry, love.

104
00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.250
Um, would you mind backing up?

105
00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:07.375
Only it's a bit tight down this end,
and my friend's only just passed his test.


106
00:07:07.458 --> 00:07:10.458
Yeah, I'm amazed he got a licence
considering he's visually impaired.


107
00:07:10.541 --> 00:07:12.416
- It's a one-way street.
- What?


108
00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:18.875
Sorry about that.
We're from out of town.


109
00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:22.000
Yeah, you don't say. Only an idiot
would bring that thing down here.


110
00:07:22.083 --> 00:07:24.392
Oh, nothing to do with the bright spark
who designed a road system


111
00:07:24.416 --> 00:07:25.642
that's too narrow to drive down.

112
00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:28.166
Yeah, how short-sighted
of the 17th century town planner


113
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.875
not to account for that cock extension.

114
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.666
You're gonna have to back up.

115
00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:40.916
What a tosser.

116
00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:43.583
What's a... tosser?

117
00:07:44.666 --> 00:07:46.000
Well...

118
00:07:46.083 --> 00:07:48.291
<i>So let's have a toast, ay?</i>

119
00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:50.750
<i>To
-To the newest resident of Port Isaac.</i>

120
00:07:51.666 --> 00:07:54.208
- To Kenwyn.
- To Kenwyn.


121
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:58.541
May he bring as much joy, laughter
and wisdom to our world as...


122
00:07:58.625 --> 00:07:59.666
as his granfer did.

123
00:08:00.791 --> 00:08:01.791
Thanks, Jim.

124
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.875
I'll be there in a minute.

125
00:08:05.958 --> 00:08:07.416
Who's Sir Walter Raleigh?

126
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.791
Some wanker from London.

127
00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:11.851
Apparently, they're staying up
at Charles Montegue's place.


128
00:08:11.875 --> 00:08:14.333
Huh? Damn bloody emmets.

129
00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:17.875
Coming down here like they own the place
with their second homes,


130
00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:20.916
and... only visit twice a bloody year.

131
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Gives us two chances to take their money,
son.


132
00:08:24.083 --> 00:08:25.351
If it were down to me,

133
00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:29.166
we'd have toll booths on every road
crossing the River Tamar.


134
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:30.458
That's what they do in Wales.

135
00:08:30.541 --> 00:08:32.750
Charge the buggers
for the privilege of coming in.


136
00:08:32.833 --> 00:08:36.875
Hey, you get any more militant, my son,

137
00:08:36.958 --> 00:08:39.500
you'll have to join
the Cornish National Liberation Army.


138
00:08:39.583 --> 00:08:41.125
- I never left, Father.
- Good boy.


139
00:08:43.416 --> 00:08:45.500
- Hello, gentlemen.
- How are you?


140
00:08:45.583 --> 00:08:47.958
- Four pints of lager, please.
- Lager?


141
00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:51.500
I'm afraid we don't have much call
for fizzy drinks this time of year.


142
00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:56.166
We've got Tribute, Proper Job
and guest ale, Bishop's Finger.


143
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.625
Do we know where it's been?

144
00:08:57.708 --> 00:09:00.583
That was good, man. 
That was good.

145
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:05.250
No. But I got a pretty good idea
where he could stick it.


146
00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:19.625
Oh, here he is. 
Captain Pugwash.

147
00:09:19.708 --> 00:09:21.291
- Don't shout.
- Morning, chaps.


148
00:09:21.875 --> 00:09:23.666
Slight change of plan, I'm afraid.

149
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.208
We won't be casting off
or trimming the jib today.


150
00:09:26.291 --> 00:09:27.559
Is that a euphemism?

151
00:09:27.583 --> 00:09:30.250
No, the boat's stuck in Milford Haven
with a ripped sail.


152
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:33.125
- Where's Milford Haven?
- Wales.


153
00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:35.250
- How we gettin' there?
- We're not, Driss.


154
00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:38.500
You're telling me I gave up a seat
at the roulette table in the Bellagio


155
00:09:38.583 --> 00:09:39.666
for a weekend yachting,

156
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:41.000
and we don't have a yacht?

157
00:09:41.458 --> 00:09:42.458
Correct.

158
00:09:42.541 --> 00:09:44.333
Well, what are we gonna do instead?

159
00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:50.750
Whoa!

160
00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:54.625
It's last man standing!

161
00:09:56.875 --> 00:09:58.583
Hey, guys. I'm getting the hang of this.

162
00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:00.625
Oh, oh, New York, here I come!

163
00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:04.250
- No sign of those numpties?
- No.


164
00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:06.708
- When were they due back?
- About two hours ago.


165
00:10:10.833 --> 00:10:13.153
- We've gotta get those boards.
- I am staying on dry land.


166
00:10:13.208 --> 00:10:15.250
Another 20 minutes,
and there won't be any!


167
00:10:15.333 --> 00:10:17.291
Hey, hey. You can get that one.
Get that one.


168
00:10:17.375 --> 00:10:18.750
I'm not sure. I'll try.

169
00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.809
Henry, no.
He's gonna fall and crack his head open.


170
00:10:20.833 --> 00:10:22.642
- Danny, he could get that one.
- I'm gonna fall...


171
00:10:22.666 --> 00:10:25.208
- No, he can get it.
- Help!


172
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.125
Jago, I need you to come
and help me get these sheets off the line.


173
00:10:30.208 --> 00:10:32.916
He's a fisherman, Maggie,
not a bloody chambermaid.


174
00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:37.625
This has to be
the worst stag do of all time.


175
00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:42.500
Christ, we've got a shout!

176
00:10:42.583 --> 00:10:43.708
Where's me pager, Maggie?

177
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:48.541
Don't ask me. I'm a barmaid,
not a Lifeboat Operations Manager.


178
00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:52.041
- What we got?
- Three men in the water off Tag's Pit!


179
00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:53.125
Dig! Dig!

180
00:10:58.916 --> 00:11:01.541
- Over here!
- Boat! Help!


181
00:11:03.958 --> 00:11:06.791
All right now. Stay calm. Wait.

182
00:11:07.916 --> 00:11:09.750
- One at a time!
- Move. Move.


183
00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:12.416
- One at a time!
- Careful. Get up. Get up.


184
00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.458
All right. You. Get on.

185
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:17.741
Oh, thank you so much.
I thought we were goners.


186
00:11:33.625 --> 00:11:35.666
Here, ladies. You forgot your handbag.

187
00:11:36.375 --> 00:11:39.000
Oof. Oh.

188
00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:41.625
We're on a stag do.

189
00:11:41.708 --> 00:11:44.059
You're never gonna get to the wedding
if you carry on like that.


190
00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:46.803
- Take it easy, Jim.
- Well, they're hangin'. All of 'em.


191
00:11:47.375 --> 00:11:49.375
Probably been on the wacky backy too.

192
00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:50.559
- Wacky backy?
- Jim, come on.


193
00:11:50.583 --> 00:11:53.333
Well, why else would they drag us out
on a day like this?


194
00:11:53.416 --> 00:11:55.958
Hey, relax, chief.
We come in peace, man. Okay?


195
00:11:56.041 --> 00:11:57.166
Chief?

196
00:11:57.666 --> 00:12:00.583
Hey, listen. We're just not
used to the ocean, all right?


197
00:12:00.666 --> 00:12:03.041
You'd do well to show her
a bit of respect.


198
00:12:03.125 --> 00:12:04.166
- Oh, shit!
- What?


199
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:05.500
Driss!

200
00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:09.958
Help!

201
00:12:12.583 --> 00:12:14.416
Help!

202
00:12:15.083 --> 00:12:17.416
Help.

203
00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.166
<i>Port Isaac, this is Whisky Bravo 178.</i>

204
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:24.166

of Tag's Pit.</i>


205

207

One, two, one, two, one, two.

208
00:12:37.375 --> 00:12:41.666
I thought we was having a sing-song,
not putting on a bloody rock concert.


209
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.333
You're not here to hide, Jago.
You're here to be heard.


210
00:12:44.416 --> 00:12:45.750
<i>Thank you, Yoko Ono.</i>

211
00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:49.000
- I shall be listening.
- I know you will.


212
00:12:51.375 --> 00:12:52.458
See you, Sal.

213
00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:55.250
Can't keep ignoring the bank, Rowan.

214
00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:01.666
You need to call them.

215
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:04.958
I'm not sure what to say.

216
00:13:05.041 --> 00:13:06.875
This came from the Inland Revenue.

217
00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:22.291
I am not the pheasant plucker.

218
00:13:22.375 --> 00:13:24.833
I'm the pheasant plucker's mate.

219
00:13:25.125 --> 00:13:30.250
And I'm only plucking pheasants
'cause the pheasant plucker's late.


220
00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:32.458
I'm only fucking pheas...

221
00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:35.000
No, I... I can't
get my tongue round it!

222
00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:37.750
Well, that's not what Rowan's
been telling everyone.


223
00:13:39.458 --> 00:13:41.583
Get off me, you great arse!

224
00:13:41.666 --> 00:13:44.791
Here, do you two want to get a room
or shall we get on with it, eh?


225
00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:46.750
Ooh!

226
00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:53.583
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're the Fisherman's Friends.


227
00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:55.625
We all hail from Port Isaac,

228
00:13:55.708 --> 00:13:58.958
and the songs we're singing today
are about sailors and the sea.


229
00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:02.291
These songs come from a time
when sailors were clapped in irons,


230
00:14:02.375 --> 00:14:05.250
hung from the highest yardarm,
nailed to the mast,


231
00:14:05.333 --> 00:14:06.333
shanghaied, wanghaied...

232
00:14:06.416 --> 00:14:08.267
- Hey, stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
- What? Here?


233
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:09.809
- Yeah, here. Right here. Pull in.
- Why?


234
00:14:09.833 --> 00:14:12.125
...rum, bum, buggered, blinded...

235
00:14:15.083 --> 00:14:16.666
And that was all before they set sail.

236
00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:20.875
Jim over there,
he's been sufferin' from a sore throat.


237
00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:24.583
Sounds nasty. Have you consulted
your health care professional about it?


238
00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:25.958
Yes, I have, son.

239
00:14:26.041 --> 00:14:29.750
Well, if the antibiotics don't work, you
can always suck on a Fisherman's Friend.


240
00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:32.250
Oh.

241
00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:37.083
This next song is John Kanaka,
a right rascal if ever there was one.

Yeah, why don't you
sign 'em up for life?

Oh, don't be so cynical.

257
00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:21.875
These songs
are reminiscent of the work songs


258
00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:24.000
sung on the plantations by my people.

259
00:15:24.083 --> 00:15:26.541
I'm not sure these are slave songs, Troy.

260
00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:31.666
Well, okay,
but fishermen are slaves to the sea,


261
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.541
and exploited peoples across the globe

262
00:15:33.625 --> 00:15:35.958
have always shared their suffering
through song.

The rock 'n' roll of 1752.

You'd better come and talk to the boys.

299
00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:36.791
For your information,
my Jago is the Roger Daltry of the group.


300
00:17:37.416 --> 00:17:39.083
Well, I'll bear that in mind.

301
00:17:41.416 --> 00:17:43.583
Here, you'll never guess what.

302
00:17:44.416 --> 00:17:47.708
- Our boys have just been talent-spotted.
- By who?


303
00:17:47.791 --> 00:17:49.125
Your admirer.

304
00:17:49.791 --> 00:17:52.916
Apparently, he's some kind of big shot
in the music industry.


305
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.875
Watching you sing was one of those...
rare moments in the music business


306
00:17:57.958 --> 00:18:01.833
when you realise you are
witnessing something truly original.


307
00:18:01.916 --> 00:18:04.875
The bottom line is...
you've got a unique sound.


308
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:08.916
And we believe we can help you
get it released by a major label.


309
00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:22.000
You can't be...

310
00:18:22.083 --> 00:18:24.458
Now, all right, all right.
Now look, look, look.


311
00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:27.166
I'm serious.

312
00:18:28.291 --> 00:18:31.166
So how's about we crack open the champagne
and get this deal done?


313
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:32.541
Right here. Right now.

314
00:18:32.625 --> 00:18:34.708
Hang on. You mean this is for real?

315
00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:39.041
Thanks for the offer, son,
but we're just fishermen, see.


316
00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:42.666
We have no need to sell our souls
for 15 minutes of fame.


317
00:18:43.625 --> 00:18:45.041
Especially to an emmet.

318
00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:47.541
An emmet?

319
00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:49.541
It's old Cornish for an ant.

320
00:18:50.333 --> 00:18:53.041
Something that invades in large numbers,

321
00:18:53.958 --> 00:18:57.833
causes great irritation
and is a helluva job to get rid of.


322
00:18:57.916 --> 00:18:59.750
Now, if you don't mind...

323
00:19:01.791 --> 00:19:04.208
some of us have got
some real work to do.

324
00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:12.166
Thanks for your time.

325
00:19:16.625 --> 00:19:17.666
Where's the...?

326
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:29.333
Oh. Come on.

327
00:19:31.666 --> 00:19:32.916
Fuck it. Just one bar.

328
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.041
The only place you'll get reception
down here is on the sea wall.


329
00:19:36.583 --> 00:19:38.083
Way out there?

330
00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.333
- Is that Danny?
- Mmm.


331
00:19:45.416 --> 00:19:47.875
Is that... Wait. All right. All right.
All right, get it.


332
00:19:47.958 --> 00:19:50.333
Hey, Danny, what's going on, man?

333
00:19:50.416 --> 00:19:52.416
Where the bloody hell
have you parked the car?


334
00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.750
- Ah, sorry, bro. We had to peel out.
<i>- Eh?</i>


335
00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:58.375
- Major, major crisis.
- Well, what about <i>this</i> major crisis?


336
00:19:58.458 --> 00:20:01.333
Look,
you never leave a man behind enemy lines.


337
00:20:01.416 --> 00:20:02.583
<i>First rule of war!</i>

338
00:20:02.666 --> 00:20:04.684
First rule of rock 'n' roll,
don't forget the money.


339
00:20:04.708 --> 00:20:07.291
As soon as they've signed,
we'll get you out of there.


340
00:20:07.375 --> 00:20:10.541
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
but they ain't signing anything, mate.


341
00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.458
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Oh, oh, Danny.


342
00:20:13.541 --> 00:20:14.583
<i>Hello?</i>

343
00:20:14.666 --> 00:20:16.750
I'm... I'm sorry.
Have-Have you lost your touch?


344
00:20:16.833 --> 00:20:19.708
No. These guys aren't interested
in fame and fortune.


345
00:20:19.791 --> 00:20:22.708
Hey, hey. Everybody's interested
in fame and fortune.


346
00:20:22.791 --> 00:20:25.125
So do your job and close the deal.

347
00:20:25.875 --> 00:20:29.333
I don't want to wake up and find out
somebody else has beat us to it.


348
00:20:32.708 --> 00:20:36.208
Hello. Hello? Shit.

349
00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:40.541
Ooh.

350
00:20:42.166 --> 00:20:44.291
Hold up! Whoa, whoa. Hold up.

351
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.458
What's it gonna take
to get you boys over the line, eh?


352
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.083
Sorry, Danny. It isn't going to happen.

353
00:20:53.958 --> 00:20:56.541
For me, Leadville and Rowan
'tis a dream come true, but...


354
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.250
but me boy and a
few others ain't so keen.

355
00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:02.333
We don't need the others, Jago.
Five is more than enough.


356
00:21:02.416 --> 00:21:05.541
In fact, five is the magic number
when it comes to any boy band.


357
00:21:05.625 --> 00:21:08.375
You know, look at, er, the Jackson Five,
Take That.


358
00:21:09.291 --> 00:21:12.333
Now, we got to stick together down here,
one an' all.


359
00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:17.041
That's the difference between
sinking or swimming in a place like this.


360
00:21:17.125 --> 00:21:20.916
Yup, the only way this'll work
is if you manage to convince Jim.


361
00:21:21.708 --> 00:21:23.916
Well, how do I do that?

362
00:21:24.791 --> 00:21:26.958
There's an old Corny saying.

363
00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:31.625
You never know a man till you find out
what his legs is made of at sea.


364
00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:45.958
Where's the lift?

365
00:21:59.666 --> 00:22:02.458
I thought I'd made my position
perfectly clear.


366
00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:05.708
You did,
but us ants are tricky to get rid of.


367
00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:06.833
Hello, darling'.

368
00:22:07.375 --> 00:22:09.416
Jago said there may
be room at the inn.

369
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:12.583
Yeah, you...
You'd have to ask my daughter about that.


370
00:22:12.666 --> 00:22:14.541
She runs the B
& B side of things.

371
00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.041
Tam, could you go and fetch your mother,
please. Thanks, darling.


372
00:22:18.125 --> 00:22:19.791
Mam! The tosser's at the door!

373
00:22:22.666 --> 00:22:23.708
Yeah?

374
00:22:27.666 --> 00:22:28.666
Tosser.

375
00:22:36.541 --> 00:22:37.583
Hello again.

376
00:22:38.708 --> 00:22:40.083
I'm looking for a room.

377
00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.541
I'm sorry. We're full.

378
00:22:43.291 --> 00:22:45.875
Well, that's...
not what it says on the sign.


379
00:22:48.208 --> 00:22:51.333
Look. It's just for one night,
and I've got an early start.


380
00:23:08.791 --> 00:23:10.517
<i>Severe gale nine...</i>

381
00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:12.208
<i>to violent storm eleven.</i>

382
00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:14.208
<i>Rain then squally showers.</i>

383
00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:17.166
<i>Poor becoming moderate. Jersey...</i>

384
00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:20.666
Mr Anderson.

385
00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.583
You're waking up the other guests.

386
00:23:27.333 --> 00:23:28.791
Mr Anderson.

387
00:23:37.208 --> 00:23:38.500
Mr Anderson!

388
00:23:40.791 --> 00:23:42.416
Oh! Oh!

389
00:23:44.458 --> 00:23:45.458
Your wake-up call.

390
00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:48.458
Oh, er... What is it?

391
00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:56.375
I'm coming!

392
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Pull up the anchor. I'm here.


393
00:24:05.583 --> 00:24:08.541
Sorry I'm late.

394
00:24:09.208 --> 00:24:10.875
What have you come as, then?

395
00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:13.791
We're going fishing, son,
not competing in The America's Cup.


396
00:24:16.125 --> 00:24:18.333
You're gonna have to
change that jumper, boy.


397
00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:20.250
Fishermen don't wear green.

398
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.666
Makes the boat seek land.

399
00:24:25.458 --> 00:24:27.458
And don't whistle on board.

400
00:24:28.625 --> 00:24:30.833
To whistle
is to challenge the wind herself.


401
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:33.875
She might whip up a proper storm.

402
00:24:34.833 --> 00:24:36.625
- Anything else?
- Yeah,


403
00:24:36.708 --> 00:24:38.833
turn starboard after leaving the dock.

404
00:24:38.916 --> 00:24:41.208
Always kiss the first fish you catch.

405
00:24:41.708 --> 00:24:46.083
Never, ever, under any circumstance,
say the word "rabbit"!


406
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:48.958
- Rabbit?
- Shh!


407
00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:55.250
<i>♪ Yo, ho, heave ho
Yo, ho, heave ho ♪</i>


408
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.666
<i>♪ Yo, ho, heave ho
Yo, ho, heave ho ♪</i>


409
00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:04.125

412
00:25:08.583 --> 00:25:11.416
- You all right, Danny?
- Yeah.


413
00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:14.875
- Do you want an orange?
- Will it stop me feeling sick?


414
00:25:14.958 --> 00:25:17.625
No, just makes it smell sweeter
when it comes up.


415
00:25:21.375 --> 00:25:23.166
Oh, oh.

416
00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.500
Here, answer me this, then.

417
00:25:26.583 --> 00:25:27.958
What I don't understand...

418
00:25:28.541 --> 00:25:31.875
is why anyone would wanna part
with their hard-earned cash


419
00:25:32.583 --> 00:25:35.708
to buy a record sung
by ten hairy-ass fishermen.


420
00:25:35.791 --> 00:25:38.375
Because deep down,
there's a sailor in all of us.


421
00:25:38.458 --> 00:25:41.875
There's never been a sailor in me!

422
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.250
Your songs...

423
00:25:45.458 --> 00:25:47.708
transport the listener
to distant shores...


424
00:25:48.208 --> 00:25:51.458
and allows them to return stronger
and braver than they've ever felt before.


425
00:25:51.541 --> 00:25:53.541
I never thought I'd say this to anyone,

426
00:25:53.875 --> 00:25:55.791
but I think you talk more bollocks
than my wife.


427
00:25:55.875 --> 00:25:57.333
God rest her soul.

428
00:25:57.958 --> 00:26:00.791
Look, what I'm proposing
is that you come up to London,


429
00:26:00.875 --> 00:26:03.625
record a demo
so the labels have got something to hear.


430
00:26:04.083 --> 00:26:07.250
We can't go on a jolly like that,
we got lobster to catch.


431
00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:09.625
Well, okay.
Then, we'll record it down here.


432
00:26:09.708 --> 00:26:11.500
Duke Management will cover
all your expenses.


433
00:26:11.583 --> 00:26:13.041
Is there any money in it for us?

434
00:26:13.125 --> 00:26:15.458
Well, if we're lucky enough
to land a deal, yeah.


435
00:26:15.875 --> 00:26:19.916
Not a fortune, mind you, but, you know,
definitely enough to go on a nice holiday.


436
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.333
Maggie Googled him.

437
00:26:23.125 --> 00:26:24.666
He is who he says he is.

438
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:26.458
Sally reckons he's a proper big shot.

439
00:26:27.208 --> 00:26:28.916
Proper big mouth, more like.

440
00:26:29.375 --> 00:26:33.000
Come on, Dad. You always told me,
"Never trust an emmet,"


441
00:26:33.083 --> 00:26:36.208
and I've never met one yet
who could prove you wrong.


442
00:26:37.125 --> 00:26:41.375
Listen, son.
One thing I've learned in my old age.


443
00:26:41.916 --> 00:26:44.458
It ain't so much black and white
as them an' us.


444
00:26:45.375 --> 00:26:47.791
We have to take every man
on his own merit.


445
00:26:48.125 --> 00:26:50.541
Yeah. We might even
make money out of it.

446
00:26:51.125 --> 00:26:54.791
Come on, Rowan.
It's a bloody pipe dream, and you know it.


447
00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.750
Right now, I'll give anything a shot.

448
00:27:05.541 --> 00:27:09.750
Ooh. No charge for the wake-up call then?

449
00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:12.125
All part of the service.

450
00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:15.125
I'll make sure I mention it
in my Trip Advisor review.


451
00:27:19.458 --> 00:27:21.333
Mr Anderson, I'm glad I caught you.

452
00:27:22.208 --> 00:27:24.500
- Can we have a word?
- Yeah.


453
00:27:25.041 --> 00:27:26.041
Come on in. Sit down.

454
00:27:27.041 --> 00:27:28.041
Here.

455
00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:30.250
Ah, now.

456
00:27:35.416 --> 00:27:36.416
Now...

457
00:27:37.625 --> 00:27:39.875
just for clarity's sake...

458
00:27:41.291 --> 00:27:43.750
if we did agree
to let you manage us...

459
00:27:44.875 --> 00:27:48.125
you'd have to understand
that our real work comes first.


460
00:27:48.208 --> 00:27:51.083
Now we, we got boats,
businesses to run and...


461
00:27:51.958 --> 00:27:54.916
and they'd have to...
be looked after before anything else.


462
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.083
Absolutely.

463
00:27:58.208 --> 00:28:02.250
And you'd have to promise
you wouldn't take the piss.


464
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.250
Now, we've got our ways down here.

465
00:28:06.333 --> 00:28:11.333
And once you cross the River Tamar,
you're not in England any more.


466
00:28:12.416 --> 00:28:13.666
We're a land apart.

467
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.958
Now you-you get my drift, son?

468
00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.916
I give you my word.

469
00:28:21.333 --> 00:28:22.333
Good.

470
00:28:24.166 --> 00:28:25.375
'Cause down here...

471
00:28:27.041 --> 00:28:31.000
a man's word is... strong as Cornish oak.

472
00:28:42.333 --> 00:28:44.875
- Danny's on line three.
- All right, put him through.


473
00:28:47.708 --> 00:28:50.458
If it isn't the Pirate of Penzance!

474
00:28:50.541 --> 00:28:54.250
Yeah. I forgot
what a gifted comedian you are, Troy.


475
00:28:54.333 --> 00:28:57.125
Danny, have you plundered the village
and found any hidden treasures?


476
00:28:57.208 --> 00:28:58.458
<i>I did indeed, Henry.</i>

477
00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:01.916
Not only have I persuaded all
ten fishermen to sign on the dotted line,


478
00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.166
they're also up for recording a demo.

479
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:07.791
<i>Oh, my God. Oh!</i>

480
00:29:07.875 --> 00:29:10.708
I cannot believe you fell for that!
You knobber!


481
00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:11.791
What?

482
00:29:12.916 --> 00:29:14.958
Danny, it was a joke, bro!

483
00:29:15.041 --> 00:29:18.708
Do you really think we would sign
a boy band with a combined age of 653?


484
00:29:19.208 --> 00:29:20.625
You bastards.

485
00:29:21.541 --> 00:29:23.666
<i>Now, I suggest you tear up that contract</i>

486
00:29:24.125 --> 00:29:26.750
and get yourself back within the M25
where you belong.


487
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.750
- I can't.
- Why?


488
00:29:33.083 --> 00:29:34.458
I've given them my word.

489
00:29:34.958 --> 00:29:37.708
When did that ever count for anything?

490
00:30:00.875 --> 00:30:01.875
Hi, there.

491
00:30:03.208 --> 00:30:04.416
I'm impressed.

492
00:30:05.833 --> 00:30:06.833
You are?

493
00:30:07.541 --> 00:30:09.621
Can't believe you got 'em
to give up a day's fishing.


494
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:12.416
Yeah.

495
00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.125
I just hope you make all this bother
worth their while.


496
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.083
Well, that's the plan.

497
00:30:17.625 --> 00:30:20.541
I mean, after all,
I gave your dad my word.

00:31:48.666 --> 00:31:52.666
Lord Almighty. 
We're scuppered now.

516
00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.041
Sorry? Scuppered?

517
00:31:54.416 --> 00:31:55.708
It's a sign.

518
00:31:56.166 --> 00:31:58.333
Like the albatross in the <i>Ancient Mariner.</i>

519
00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:00.666
Samuel Taylor Coleridge, you know?

520
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:04.666
- No.
- Kills the albatross is becalmed.


521
00:32:05.125 --> 00:32:06.500
Becalmed?

522
00:32:06.583 --> 00:32:07.916
Dead in the water, mate.

523
00:32:08.625 --> 00:32:12.208
Water, water everywhere,
but not a bloody drop to drink.


524
00:32:13.041 --> 00:32:15.333
Yeah, but it's a... It's a seagull.
It's not an albatross.


525
00:32:16.208 --> 00:32:17.708
It's the same difference, Danny.

526
00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:21.541
Yeah. A curse is a curse.

527
00:32:26.208 --> 00:32:27.375
How's it going?

528
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.000
Oh. Got some great guest vocals
from the seagulls.


529
00:32:32.833 --> 00:32:34.916
Why don't you try recording in the church?

530
00:32:35.666 --> 00:32:38.208
It's where they all learned to sing.
It's brilliant acoustics.


531
00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:41.833
I-I reckon it'll be easier
if we went into the studio.


532
00:32:42.541 --> 00:32:44.333
Then you risk losing their charm.

533
00:32:44.916 --> 00:32:48.708
The people that come and listen to them
don't care if they hit the high notes.


534
00:32:48.791 --> 00:32:50.833
They want to be transported
to the high seas.

No. You were right. 
The sound's great.

549
00:33:49.125 --> 00:33:52.333
Although I was picking up a little bit
of interference in the last verse.


550
00:33:52.416 --> 00:33:55.041
Might be me pacemaker.

551
00:33:55.125 --> 00:33:58.208
Now you don't want to be turning that off,
Father.


552
00:34:03.458 --> 00:34:06.291
Right. Take five, lads,
but, um, well done, everyone.


553
00:34:06.375 --> 00:34:08.250
Sounding... brilliant.

554

Do me a favour and
take care of it, Driss.

555
00:34:16.458 --> 00:34:20.000
Yeah, j-just tell Troy I'll be back
by the end of the week. Okay?


556
00:34:21.333 --> 00:34:22.653
Yeah, listen. I've got to bounce.

557
00:34:24.541 --> 00:34:27.208
- Off already?
- Got to pick Tamsyn up from school.


558
00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.750
Ah. Listen, thanks again for the tip-off.

559
00:34:30.833 --> 00:34:32.875
I mean, this place is a real discovery.

560
00:34:34.125 --> 00:34:36.833
Hardly. I've been coming here all my life.

561
00:34:36.916 --> 00:34:38.596
Six generations of my family buried there.

562
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.791
Um, could I...
buy you a drink later to say thank you?


563
00:34:47.166 --> 00:34:49.166
Sorry, I already got plans.

564
00:34:50.375 --> 00:34:51.833
Anything exciting?

565
00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:55.916
Homework. Big pile of laundry.

566
00:34:57.208 --> 00:34:58.791
Well, maybe some other time then.

567
00:34:59.583 --> 00:35:00.875
Yeah, maybe.

568
00:35:04.083 --> 00:35:05.541
About that curse?

569
00:35:07.458 --> 00:35:09.541
They're winding you up, Danny.

570
00:35:29.791 --> 00:35:31.166
Okay, lads.

571
00:35:31.791 --> 00:35:34.333
Now, we've got nine shanties in the can,

572
00:35:34.416 --> 00:35:36.750
which means we're one track
short of an album.


573
00:35:37.375 --> 00:35:39.175
- Well, can I make a suggestion?
- Yeah.


574
00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:42.500
Something more melodic. "Widow Woman."

575
00:35:42.583 --> 00:35:43.642
Mm, aye.

576
00:35:43.666 --> 00:35:45.500
Oh, I'm... I'm not singing that.

577
00:35:45.583 --> 00:35:47.101
Come on, now, Rowan.
Don't be shy. Come on.


578
00:35:47.125 --> 00:35:49.017
- No.
- It's one of your best songs.


579
00:35:49.041 --> 00:35:50.201
- Come on, my lovely.
- Go on.


580
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.708

Down Port Quin.

Herring fleet went out.

594

They say the gale blowed up
in a couple of hours.


595
00:37:15.208 --> 00:37:16.208
All was lost.

596
00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:19.958
Two dozen widows was made that day.

597
00:37:23.333 --> 00:37:25.500
We still suffer tragedies
from time to time,

00:37:32.208 --> 00:37:35.833
which one of you fair maids

00:37:36.333 --> 00:37:37.583
Oh, bollocks!

603
00:37:38.208 --> 00:37:40.500
What we lack in traffic wardens down here,
Danny,


604
00:37:40.583 --> 00:37:43.791
we more than make up for
with the fast incoming spring tide, see.


605
00:37:51.583 --> 00:37:52.583
Driss!

611
00:38:12.708 --> 00:38:15.666
Yeah. I've been trying to contact Danny.

612
00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.559
His phone keeps going to voice mail.
What's going on?


613
00:38:17.583 --> 00:38:20.250
Pillock's still in Cornwall,
trying to bang that bird.


614
00:38:21.166 --> 00:38:23.541
- What bird?
- The girl with the Noddy car.


615
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.166
Who's Noddy?

Danny. Telephone for you.

620
00:38:48.833 --> 00:38:50.000
Thank you.

621
00:38:53.041 --> 00:38:54.250
Hello.

622
00:38:54.333 --> 00:38:55.958
<i>You proved your point, Danny.</i>

623
00:38:56.041 --> 00:39:00.125
- Now it's time to get back to business.
- This is business, Troy.


624
00:39:00.208 --> 00:39:04.041
<i>Cut the bullshit, Danny. I know
you're down there just trying to get laid.</i>


625
00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:05.958
All right, hands up, I <i>was.</i>

626
00:39:06.416 --> 00:39:07.875
<i>But things have changed.</i>

627
00:39:07.958 --> 00:39:11.250
Listen, I was reading up on sea shanties,
and you're right.


628
00:39:11.333 --> 00:39:14.000
They do have universal appeal.
I mean, after all,


629
00:39:14.083 --> 00:39:17.041
maritime work songs
were the rock 'n' roll of 1752.


630
00:39:17.458 --> 00:39:19.208
Has all the ocean
air gone to your head?

631
00:39:19.291 --> 00:39:22.666
All right, maybe. But I genuinely think
these guys have got something to say.


632
00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:24.453
<i>I'm recording one more song,</i>

633
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.059
<i>then I've got an album
to send out to the labels.</i>


634
00:39:26.083 --> 00:39:28.041
- Let them be the judge.
<i>- Hey! Hey!</i>


635
00:39:29.083 --> 00:39:30.583
<i>This has gone far enough, Danny.</i>

636
00:39:30.666 --> 00:39:32.416
<i>I want you back at your desk...</i>

637
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.708
after Henry's wedding

638
00:39:33.791 --> 00:39:36.375
to deal with the acts
that actually make us commission!


639
00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:39.166
What's wrong?

640
00:39:41.208 --> 00:39:42.458
Danny's gone native.

641
00:39:47.583 --> 00:39:48.958
Come in.

642
00:39:51.125 --> 00:39:52.416
Hiya.

643
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:55.150
Helping your mum with her homework?

644
00:39:55.208 --> 00:39:58.333
We're doing kings and queens of England.

645
00:39:58.416 --> 00:40:00.125
My favourite is King Canute.

646
00:40:00.208 --> 00:40:01.559
That's the one who stopped the tide,

647
00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:03.583
and then the tide won
and he got soaked, right?


648
00:40:03.666 --> 00:40:07.416
Yeah, what an idiot.
Everyone knows you can't stop the sea.


649
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.875
Um, I just wanted to ask
about those photographs


650
00:40:11.958 --> 00:40:13.238
of the fishermen in the hallway.

651
00:40:13.291 --> 00:40:15.208
Er, you don't happen
to know who took them?


652
00:40:15.916 --> 00:40:17.000
I did.

653
00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:19.875
Seriously?

654
00:40:21.625 --> 00:40:22.666
Well, they're fantastic.

655
00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:24.833
Thank you.

656
00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:28.625
It would be great if we had some pictures
of them to send out with the demo.


657
00:40:28.708 --> 00:40:30.625
I don't suppose you'd be interested?

658
00:40:30.708 --> 00:40:33.000
Yeah. What were you thinking?

659
00:40:33.083 --> 00:40:35.875
Well, something with a nautical theme
that would stand out


660
00:40:35.958 --> 00:40:37.375
in a supermarket checkout.

661
00:40:39.458 --> 00:40:40.916
Sounds a bit naff.

662
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:44.041
Well, to be fair,
I haven't really given it much thought.


663
00:40:45.708 --> 00:40:48.666
Well, if you're interested in capturing
who they really are,


664
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:50.208
that's something I can do.

665
00:40:51.375 --> 00:40:52.375
Great.

00:41:19.583 --> 00:41:22.625

- Coming to give us an hard time.


675
00:41:22.708 --> 00:41:24.458
And to make sure
we can't earn a living.

676
00:41:24.541 --> 00:41:26.083
It's all right. 
I'll deal with them.

677
00:41:30.291 --> 00:41:32.916
We're not fishing today, Officer.
We're just taking a few photos.


678
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:35.851
I'm still going to need to
check the hold and your log books.


679
00:41:35.875 --> 00:41:37.333
Twenty minutes, we lose the light.

680
00:41:37.833 --> 00:41:40.541
Officer, you're wasting your time
as well as ours.


681
00:41:40.625 --> 00:41:43.392
- You can see there's no fish.
- Stand back, sir. I'm only doing my job.


682
00:41:43.416 --> 00:41:46.625
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought your job
was to protect our shores.


683
00:41:47.375 --> 00:41:50.333
Not to harass ordinary working men
who are trying to earn a living.


684
00:41:50.833 --> 00:41:53.333
Do you know?
I think the taxpayer has a right to know


685
00:41:53.416 --> 00:41:55.333
how their hard-earned money
is being spent.


686
00:41:55.416 --> 00:41:56.625
Give us that.

687
00:41:57.041 --> 00:41:59.458
Smile.
Your 15 minutes of fame is about to start.


688
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:02.375
- Put that away, sir.
- Or what?


689
00:42:11.083 --> 00:42:12.125
What did you get?

690
00:42:12.208 --> 00:42:14.000
Let me off with a caution.

691
00:42:14.083 --> 00:42:16.723
But I don't think I'll be getting
me fishing licence any time soon.


692
00:42:17.666 --> 00:42:19.375
Come on. Get in.

693
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.875
My Dad'll kill me
if I'm late for quiz night.


694
00:42:44.041 --> 00:42:46.000
There he is, the hero of the hour.

695
00:42:46.458 --> 00:42:47.541
Thank you.

696
00:42:47.625 --> 00:42:49.666
You should come out with us more often,
son.


697
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.750
- Buggers might stop bothering us then.
- Don't know about that.


698
00:42:52.833 --> 00:42:57.083
Eh, tribute, my ass. It's time to open
that rare bottle of Jamaican rum.


699
00:42:57.166 --> 00:42:58.875
Oh!

700
00:42:58.958 --> 00:43:00.708
Now, this is courtesy of a shipwreck.

701
00:43:00.791 --> 00:43:03.500
Father always used to say it was like
<i>Whiskey Galore</i> all over again.


702
00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:07.125
Oh, aye. Please, Lord.

703
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.791
Let us pray for
all those on the sea.

704
00:43:11.875 --> 00:43:16.041
If's there's going to be shipwrecks,
then send them to me!


705
00:43:17.666 --> 00:43:20.541
Although it wasn't always nature
taking its course, was it, Grandma?


706
00:43:20.625 --> 00:43:24.458
One of Mother's ancestors was hanged
at Bodmin Assizes in 1786,


707
00:43:24.541 --> 00:43:27.416
for waving a lantern up there
on the clifftop, see.


708
00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.000
Trying to lure passing ships
on to the rocks.


709
00:43:30.083 --> 00:43:32.708
Great, Great, Great, 
Great Uncle Hedrick.

710
00:43:32.791 --> 00:43:35.166
Mind, he was the black sheep
of the family, you know.


711
00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.458
Oh, he was a rascal.
He was a right heller.


712
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:40.583
No resemblance then.

713
00:43:45.458 --> 00:43:47.333
- Alwyn.
- Trieve.


714
00:43:48.875 --> 00:43:52.541
Here, how's your general knowledge
then, son?


715
00:43:56.416 --> 00:43:59.166
<i>Okay. Next round.</i>

716
00:43:59.833 --> 00:44:00.958
<i>Music.</i>

717
00:44:01.375 --> 00:44:02.750
No pressure, Danny.

718
00:44:03.541 --> 00:44:06.500
<i>"Walk On By",
"Say A Little Prayer For Me",</i>


719
00:44:06.583 --> 00:44:12.375

for Dionne Warwick.</i>


720

<i>Now, Burt Bacharach composed the music...</i>

00:44:23.875 --> 00:44:26.166
- It's Hal David.
<i>- Number two.</i>

<i>of the UK Hit Parade ever?</i>

726

727
00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:40.530
- It's the Beatles.
- It's Elvis.


728
00:44:40.583 --> 00:44:42.291
- Well, which is it?
- Dad, it's Elvis.


729
00:44:42.375 --> 00:44:43.476
- Put Elvis.
<i>- Three.</i>


730
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.180
I thought this
was your specialist subject?


731
00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:46.333
So did I.

732
00:44:46.958 --> 00:44:50.708
<i>"Sorrow Is A Woman" was on which album?</i>

733
00:44:50.791 --> 00:44:51.958
All Through The Night!

734
00:44:52.041 --> 00:44:53.166
Hang on a minute.

735
00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.916
They got a bloody ringer on their team.

736
00:44:56.625 --> 00:44:59.500
Well, they can ask to have
another member if they want.


737
00:45:00.791 --> 00:45:03.000
You'd be better off sorting out
your own team,


738
00:45:03.083 --> 00:45:06.291
you miserable lot of town crows.

739
00:45:10.166 --> 00:45:12.125
Lost control of your wife again,
yarnigoat?


740
00:45:12.875 --> 00:45:13.875
- Jim.
- Dad!


741
00:45:13.958 --> 00:45:15.226
- Jim!
- Dad, leave it.


742
00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:16.458
Sit back down!

743
00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.625
Before I put you right on your arse!

744
00:45:21.375 --> 00:45:23.250
I done it before, Trieve.

745
00:45:23.625 --> 00:45:26.916
I would be so
happy to do it again.

746
00:45:27.875 --> 00:45:30.875
Now, calm yourself down, lads.

747
00:45:31.458 --> 00:45:34.375
None of us wants to be hauled up
back in front of the magistrate.


748
00:45:36.583 --> 00:45:39.666
Come on, my darling. Sit down, sweetheart.
Come on. Sit down, love.


749
00:45:44.125 --> 00:45:47.291
I take it being called a yarnigoat
isn't a term of endearment.


750
00:45:47.375 --> 00:45:49.208
No. Far from it.

751
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:51.250
I mean, the people from Padstow

752
00:45:51.333 --> 00:45:53.791
think that we spend
most of our time telling yarns.


753
00:45:53.875 --> 00:45:55.333
And we call them town crows

754
00:45:55.416 --> 00:46:00.291
because all they do is strut about town
crowing about how many fish they caught.


755
00:46:00.375 --> 00:46:01.375
Ah.

756
00:46:01.666 --> 00:46:03.458
So the goats and the crows, eh?

757
00:46:03.541 --> 00:46:06.916
- A bit like the Sharks and the Jets.
- Yeah, well, bloodier.


758
00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.125
Because back in the 1700s,
they used to send press gangs over here


759
00:46:10.208 --> 00:46:12.791
to grab our boys
and send them to the King's Navy.


760
00:46:14.125 --> 00:46:15.541
Ah.

761
00:46:17.166 --> 00:46:19.375
But it's also a bit more personal
than that.


762
00:46:20.708 --> 00:46:21.708
Ah?

763
00:46:22.916 --> 00:46:26.708
The guy that my dad was threatening,
he used to be my father-in-law.


764
00:46:29.875 --> 00:46:32.083
So, you were sleeping with the enemy.

765
00:46:33.291 --> 00:46:34.875
Yeah, you could say that.

766
00:46:37.125 --> 00:46:38.666
So, how long were you with him?

767
00:46:39.791 --> 00:46:41.375
Nearly five years.

768
00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:44.583
It was a really painful breakup, but...

769
00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:48.416
at least Tamsyn doesn't have to compete
with another child any more.


770
00:46:51.083 --> 00:46:52.541
- What about you?
- Hmm?


771
00:46:52.625 --> 00:46:53.750
You ever been married?

772
00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.083
Yeah,

773
00:46:56.166 --> 00:46:57.333
to the job.

774
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Thanks.

775
00:47:00.958 --> 00:47:02.125
I should go up.

776
00:47:02.833 --> 00:47:04.291
Early start for the school run.

777
00:47:07.083 --> 00:47:10.125
Who was the first artist to have
a posthumous number one in the UK?


778
00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.583
Otis Redding.

779
00:47:13.416 --> 00:47:14.916
"Dock of the Bay," 1968.

780
00:47:18.208 --> 00:47:19.416
Night, Danny.

781
00:47:20.875 --> 00:47:22.708
- Night, Dad.
- Night, my love.


782
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.708
Fancy a nightcap, man?

783
00:47:30.583 --> 00:47:31.833
Yeah, yeah.

784
00:47:44.833 --> 00:47:47.166
Certainly beats the sounds of the city.

785
00:47:50.416 --> 00:47:51.416
Yeah.

786
00:47:56.333 --> 00:47:59.291
You... You got a girlfriend up there,
or what, then?


787
00:48:01.666 --> 00:48:02.666
No.

788
00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.250
Yeah. I'm yet to meet someone
who'll put up with me.


789
00:48:08.875 --> 00:48:09.875
Right.

790
00:48:15.291 --> 00:48:17.583
Saves you getting hurt, mind?

791
00:48:28.875 --> 00:48:31.750
Well. That's, uh... 
That's me, then.

792
00:48:33.541 --> 00:48:34.541
Night, Jim.

793
00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:57.375
Okay, just check
you've got your math book...


794
00:49:02.083 --> 00:49:03.333
All right. Come on, then.

795
00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.458
With the pub running at such a loss,

796
00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:12.291
I don't see you've got any choice
but to consider selling up.


797
00:49:12.375 --> 00:49:15.125
You know as well as anyone
how much the pub means to the village.


798
00:49:15.208 --> 00:49:19.250
I do. But you've got to consider
what's best for your family, Rowan.


799
00:49:22.625 --> 00:49:23.750
All right, Father.

800
00:49:25.583 --> 00:49:28.375
- How's my little mermaid then, eh?
- Fine.


801
00:49:29.083 --> 00:49:30.875
Go and see your great granfer, go on.

802
00:49:31.583 --> 00:49:32.708
Hey, princess!

803
00:49:32.791 --> 00:49:34.625
Why didn't she spend the weekend
with her dad?


804
00:49:35.333 --> 00:49:36.666
He didn't show up again.

805
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.333
What kind of man does that?

806
00:49:41.791 --> 00:49:43.833
The kind I decided
not to spend my life with.


807
00:49:44.916 --> 00:49:47.041
Tamsyn, come on, darling.

808
00:49:50.625 --> 00:49:51.750
Be a good girl, all right?

809
00:49:52.333 --> 00:49:53.375
Say, "Bye."

810
00:49:59.833 --> 00:50:03.083
- They drink you dry last night?
- Yeah.


811
00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:05.083
Jago was the last man standing.

812
00:50:05.416 --> 00:50:08.041
Swaying, but standing.

813
00:50:08.125 --> 00:50:09.166
Catch you later.

814
00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:10.958
- Danny?
- Yeah?


815
00:50:11.416 --> 00:50:13.125
Have you got time for a quick chat?

816
00:50:13.541 --> 00:50:14.625
Yeah, sure.

817
00:50:19.333 --> 00:50:20.333
Come in, mate.

818
00:50:21.791 --> 00:50:24.458
I tried re-mortgaging,
but they won't accept.


819
00:50:24.541 --> 00:50:27.125
It's not surprising,
seeing as we aren't making much profit,


820
00:50:27.208 --> 00:50:28.375
any profit, in fact.

821
00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:31.000
Then, your solicitor
is probably right about selling up.


822
00:50:31.958 --> 00:50:35.041
What about the band? I mean,
could we make some money if it went well?


823
00:50:35.125 --> 00:50:37.708
Even if we do manage
to secure a record deal...


824
00:50:38.916 --> 00:50:42.000
anything the band makes,
you've got to split ten ways.


825
00:50:49.125 --> 00:50:50.125
Look.

826
00:50:50.791 --> 00:50:53.375
I might know someone
who'd be interested in buying the pub,


827
00:50:53.458 --> 00:50:56.666
if you were willing to do a private sale.
Cut out the middle man and all that.


828
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:57.875
It's not that easy.

829
00:50:58.291 --> 00:51:00.583
This has always been
the heart of our village.


830
00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:03.166
It means a lot
to a lot of people.

831
00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:05.958
In my experience, 
Rowan, emotions...

832
00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:07.666
They have no place in business.

833
00:51:16.333 --> 00:51:18.541
Danny, my man on the ground.

834
00:51:19.208 --> 00:51:21.333
I was just about to call you
for some local intel.


835
00:51:21.416 --> 00:51:22.416
Why, what's up?

836
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:24.833
<i>Abigail's morphed into bridezilla.</i>

837
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:27.916
<i>We need a UN peacekeeping envoy
to solve the seating plan</i>


838
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.291
and we've just lost
the official wedding photographers.


839
00:51:30.666 --> 00:51:33.166
<i>Well, I think I can probably help you out
with the photos.</i>


840
00:51:33.416 --> 00:51:35.166
That would be great.

841
00:51:35.875 --> 00:51:36.916
<i>One more thing...</i>

842
00:51:37.416 --> 00:51:40.583
<i>Abigail keeps bugging me about having
the Fishermen sing at the reception.</i>


843
00:51:40.666 --> 00:51:41.666
Seriously?

844
00:51:41.708 --> 00:51:44.428
She wants to give our guests
a flavour of the real Cornwall.


845
00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.500
I don't know.

846
00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:47.416
<i>Okay, I'll see what I can do.</i>

847
00:51:48.041 --> 00:51:50.125
Listen, the reason
why I'm calling you, yeah...


848
00:51:50.458 --> 00:51:53.458
I've just had a tip-off.
The village pub is coming up for sale.


849
00:51:53.541 --> 00:51:55.541
I thought it might interest
your father-in-law.


850
00:51:55.625 --> 00:51:58.500
Nice spot.
I'll speak to him about it this evening.


851
00:51:58.583 --> 00:52:00.041
<i>- See you now. Bye.</i>
- Thanks, Danny.


852
00:52:01.958 --> 00:52:03.125
Heads up, lads.

853
00:52:03.875 --> 00:52:05.041
Good news.

854
00:52:05.125 --> 00:52:07.166
I've got you your first professional gig.

855
00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:11.500
Ah-ah. Before you get too excited,
it's only local.


856
00:52:11.583 --> 00:52:12.750
A place called Rock.

857
00:52:13.083 --> 00:52:14.916
That ain't local 'round here.

858
00:52:15.666 --> 00:52:17.767
Our head of Business Affairs
is getting married there.


859
00:52:17.791 --> 00:52:20.351
- We look like wedding singers to you?
- A lot of powerful people


860
00:52:20.416 --> 00:52:21.851
from the music industry will be there.

861
00:52:21.875 --> 00:52:24.125
Could be a great opportunity
for a showcase.


862
00:52:25.541 --> 00:52:26.541
Well, all right.

863
00:52:27.291 --> 00:52:29.125
We won't be taking any requests, mind.

864
00:52:29.708 --> 00:52:31.083
Come on, Dad. Give us a hand.

865
00:52:31.875 --> 00:52:32.875
Good man.

866
00:52:33.958 --> 00:52:35.642
Okay, big smile.

867
00:52:35.666 --> 00:52:36.875
Okay, this time looking at me.

868
00:52:36.958 --> 00:52:38.625
Gentlemen, you're gonna step over here.

869
00:52:39.125 --> 00:52:40.333
That way? That way.

870
00:52:40.416 --> 00:52:41.791
- Facing in.
- This way?


871
00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:44.333
And then all are facing
in the same direction.


872
00:52:44.416 --> 00:52:46.333
Wait, let me just check.
Oh, no, you're good.


873
00:52:46.416 --> 00:52:49.250
Big smiles.

874
00:52:55.458 --> 00:52:57.083
Lobbers Point. 
Men in the water.

875
00:53:09.375 --> 00:53:11.750
Hey. Hey, listen.

876
00:53:12.958 --> 00:53:14.666
I'm no photographer,

877
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:18.250
but I can picture me and you together.

878
00:53:19.666 --> 00:53:21.916
Seriously, that's an image
that will never be captured.


879
00:53:24.083 --> 00:53:25.958
Well, that's a big bloody tent.

880
00:53:27.625 --> 00:53:28.875
Must have cost a bit.

881
00:53:30.291 --> 00:53:32.625
Henry passed on the details
of the Golden Lion.


882
00:53:32.708 --> 00:53:35.625
I have to say, I'm surprised
the family are thinking of selling up.


883
00:53:35.708 --> 00:53:36.750
The bloke's desperate.

884
00:53:37.583 --> 00:53:40.458
- And when's he thinking of off-loading it?
- The sooner the better.


885
00:53:40.833 --> 00:53:42.166
And your finder's fee?

886
00:53:43.166 --> 00:53:44.166
Two per cent.

887
00:53:45.625 --> 00:53:46.750
One and a half,

888
00:53:47.333 --> 00:53:49.000
- you've got yourself a deal.
- Done.


889
00:53:50.333 --> 00:53:51.333
I'll be in contact.

890
00:53:51.416 --> 00:53:52.916
- Lovely.
- Enjoy the wedding.


891
00:54:00.166 --> 00:54:02.041
All right. Grab my arm.

892
00:54:04.833 --> 00:54:05.833
Where's everyone else?

893
00:54:06.625 --> 00:54:08.291
They have something more important to do.

894
00:54:09.083 --> 00:54:10.083
Jago,

895
00:54:10.458 --> 00:54:12.833
you're singing
in front of some big players here.


896
00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.583
What can be more important than that?

897
00:54:14.666 --> 00:54:16.333
Saving lives, Danny.

898
00:54:19.458 --> 00:54:20.458
Yeah, okay.

899
00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:23.625
- You're sure you can handle the crowd?
- 'Course he can.


900
00:54:23.708 --> 00:54:26.333
He's Port Isaac's number one bingo caller.

901
00:54:26.416 --> 00:54:28.208
Testing. One, two.

902
00:54:28.291 --> 00:54:29.875
One, two.

903
00:54:29.958 --> 00:54:33.541
Hello, Kensington-on
-Sea.

904
00:54:34.666 --> 00:54:40.208
We've played to uglier audiences,
but I can't recall one right now.


905
00:54:40.291 --> 00:54:42.458
Bloody hell.
They're a miserable bunch, inum?


906
00:54:42.541 --> 00:54:44.061
Danny, what the hell is going on here?

907
00:54:44.125 --> 00:54:46.208
Abigail wanted the Fishermen to perform.

908
00:54:46.541 --> 00:54:49.041
I thought half of London
was on antidepressants.


909
00:54:49.125 --> 00:54:50.791

920
00:55:20.666 --> 00:55:23.208
This is career suicide.
Plug the plug. Now!


921
00:55:23.291 --> 00:55:25.291
I can't go up there
and drag them off, can I?


922
00:55:25.375 --> 00:55:27.175
This is not just your credibility
on the line.


923
00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:28.333
It is mine too.

924
00:55:28.416 --> 00:55:29.583
This is on you.

925
00:55:29.666 --> 00:55:31.267
- Look, just give 'em a chance.
- No chance.


926
00:55:31.291 --> 00:55:32.375
Fix it.

But you cannot judge the band
on that performance alone, Troy.


932
00:55:47.041 --> 00:55:48.892
Oh, man.
Oh, they've been judged, man.


933
00:55:48.916 --> 00:55:51.677
They've been judged, and they've been
found guilty of being horseshit.


934
00:55:51.708 --> 00:55:53.916
They're something there.
All right? Trust me.


935
00:55:54.791 --> 00:55:58.416
I've heard them sing with genuine passion
about something we've all lost.


936
00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:00.583
The only thing you appear to have lost
is your mind.


937

I'm talking about a way of life.

938

that I didn't even know existed any more.

I don't know what you've been smoking,
and quite frankly, I don't care.


940
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:13.833
But as your boss, I am commanding you
to get rid of them now.


941
00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.458
Legally, you can't do that.

942
00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:19.583
- Really?
- Yeah.


943
00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.541
Our arrangement
is that I have full control


944
00:56:22.625 --> 00:56:24.208
over every artist I sign.

945
00:56:25.250 --> 00:56:26.250
Yes.

946
00:56:28.875 --> 00:56:30.583
- Besides...
- Danny.


947
00:56:30.666 --> 00:56:32.226
I've already sent the album
out to the labels.


948
00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:33.666
You did what? You...

949
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:34.750
I have to go.

950
00:56:34.833 --> 00:56:37.351
Something's gone wrong on the rescue.
Apparently, Dad went in the water.


951
00:56:37.375 --> 00:56:38.500
Is he okay?

952
00:56:38.583 --> 00:56:41.103
They're calling the coastguard,
but they're bringing him in now.


953
00:56:41.291 --> 00:56:42.851
Come on, darling. Come on. Let's go.

954
00:56:42.875 --> 00:56:43.958
I'll come with you.

955
00:57:00.666 --> 00:57:01.666
Father.

956
00:57:05.416 --> 00:57:06.500
Dad, are you okay?

957
00:57:09.208 --> 00:57:12.333
<i>Sea mist came in.
The navigation system failed.</i>


958
00:57:12.416 --> 00:57:14.458
Boat ended up on the rocks
at Lobber point.


959
00:57:14.541 --> 00:57:15.625
Broke up in minutes.

960
00:57:15.708 --> 00:57:17.875
By the time we got there,
there were two in the water.


961
00:57:17.958 --> 00:57:19.198
Now, we got 'em both out, mind.

962
00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:24.476
<i>We must get you
to the hospital now, Mr Trevellion.</i>


963
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:27.333
You've had a nasty knock to the head.
Suspected concussion.


964
00:57:27.416 --> 00:57:28.809
Time for being brave is over.

965
00:57:28.833 --> 00:57:30.476
Dad, just do as they ask.

966
00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:33.041
- Enough. I'm going home.
- Jim.


967
00:57:33.125 --> 00:57:34.965
- Uh, Mr Trevellion.
- Dad.


968
00:57:37.666 --> 00:57:38.666
Stubborn!

969
00:57:42.875 --> 00:57:45.166
Your dad is one of the toughest blokes
I know.


970
00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.600
- <i>Sorry we let you down, Danny.
- How'd it go?</i>


971
00:57:55.041 --> 00:57:56.125
They did you proud.

972
00:58:14.333 --> 00:58:15.333
Oh!

973
00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:16.625
Hello, Tamsyn.

974
00:58:18.041 --> 00:58:20.166
What you doing sitting out here
on your own?


975
00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:21.500
Waiting for my dad.

976
00:58:30.416 --> 00:58:32.583
- You want me to wait with you?
- Sure.


977
00:58:38.833 --> 00:58:42.875
Is it true you're gonna turn Granfer Jim
into a famous pop star like Justin Bieber?


978
00:58:44.875 --> 00:58:46.375
Well, I'm gonna try.

979
00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.875
Do you think he's got the X factor?

980
00:58:50.708 --> 00:58:53.666
Well, uh, the thing
about being a Belieber...


981
00:58:55.208 --> 00:58:57.083
is that anything is possible, right?

982
00:59:00.375 --> 00:59:02.166
- Here you go.
- Hmm.


983
00:59:03.833 --> 00:59:04.833
All right?

984
00:59:05.666 --> 00:59:06.791
Hello, Jim.

985
00:59:07.375 --> 00:59:09.250
How long before
you're back out on the boat?


986
00:59:09.708 --> 00:59:10.708
Directly.

987
00:59:12.291 --> 00:59:13.291

988
00:59:13.708 --> 00:59:15.250
Yeah, it's like <i>mañana.</i>

989
00:59:15.958 --> 00:59:16.958
Only slower.

990
00:59:20.291 --> 00:59:21.750
- Granfer?
- Yeah?


991
00:59:22.541 --> 00:59:24.375
My dad's not coming, is he?

992
00:59:25.416 --> 00:59:27.875
No, I don't think he is, sweetheart,
but...


993
00:59:29.375 --> 00:59:32.083
Maybe he just got held up. 
That's all, eh?

994
00:59:36.041 --> 00:59:37.416
How about we go and ask your mum

01:04:03.791 --> 01:04:06.166
What happens when it finishes,
that concerns me.


1064
01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:09.083
- Well, this is different.
- Well, how can you possibly know that?


1065
01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.416
Sorry. It's just, uh, you know...

1066
01:04:16.583 --> 01:04:18.500
You know as well as I do that...

1067
01:04:20.208 --> 01:04:22.125
ever since your mother left...

1068
01:04:22.208 --> 01:04:23.708
And you did an amazing job.

1069
01:04:24.333 --> 01:04:26.166
I can't just stop though, Alwyn.

1070
01:04:28.791 --> 01:04:30.583
I'm always gonna worry about you.

1071
01:04:33.125 --> 01:04:36.458
Put yourself in my shoes
and imagine it was Tamsyn.


1072
01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:40.125
Oh, yeah, if it was, I wouldn't want her
hiding away for the rest of her life...


1073
01:04:40.666 --> 01:04:42.666
too scared to let anyone in.

1074
01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:48.500
Dad, I'm big enough
to make my own mistakes, okay?


1075
01:04:50.916 --> 01:04:53.596
I just don't want to see your little heart
broken again. That's all.


1076
01:04:53.666 --> 01:04:55.392
You'll never guess what!

1077
01:04:55.416 --> 01:04:56.750
I asked for croissants,

1078
01:04:56.833 --> 01:04:59.916
she said, "You're in Cornwall,
my lover, not Calais!"


1079
01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:05.500
You can take the piss out of my accent,
son,


1080
01:05:06.375 --> 01:05:08.750
but don't you ever
take the piss out of my daughter.


1081
01:05:08.833 --> 01:05:09.833
Dad.

1082
01:05:10.291 --> 01:05:12.125
No, I'm not here to hurt anyone, Jim.

1083
01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:15.333
Good.

1084
01:05:17.041 --> 01:05:18.250
Glad to hear it.

1085
01:05:21.416 --> 01:05:22.750
Sorry about my dad.

1086
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.708
He's always been protective.

1087
01:05:27.625 --> 01:05:28.750
I don't blame him.

1088
01:05:31.708 --> 01:05:34.583
Ever since he discovered
my mum was having an affair,


1089
01:05:34.666 --> 01:05:36.583
he's found it hard to trust anyone.

1090
01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:38.833
What happened?

1091
01:05:39.416 --> 01:05:40.416
She left him...

1092
01:05:41.125 --> 01:05:43.666
for a sailing instructor
from the Isle of Wight.


1093
01:05:44.875 --> 01:05:46.833
I guess his boat
was bigger than my dad's.

1094
01:05:53.083 --> 01:05:54.333
Sorry. I've got to take this.

1095
01:05:55.208 --> 01:05:56.208
Hello?

1096
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Yeah.

1097
01:06:03.083 --> 01:06:05.916
Well, why does he want
to slag 'em off to the labels like that?


1098
01:06:09.750 --> 01:06:11.625
Yeah, I'll tell you what. 
Do me a favour.

1099
01:06:11.708 --> 01:06:14.125
Tell him I don't want to be associated
with <i>him</i> any more.


1100
01:06:16.041 --> 01:06:17.041
Lads.

1101
01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.000
We've been sabotaged.

1102
01:06:20.083 --> 01:06:21.458
It's my former boss.

1103
01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.250
He isn't a fan of your music,

1104
01:06:23.333 --> 01:06:26.166
and he's been pressurising the labels
not to take the album.


1105
01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:28.083
What do you mean, your "former boss"?

1106
01:06:30.416 --> 01:06:32.041
- I resigned.
- Resign?


1107
01:06:32.125 --> 01:06:34.541
What'd you do that for, you daft bugger?

1108
01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:36.458
Because I believe in you.

1109
01:06:38.541 --> 01:06:42.208
I believe in the music, and
I believe I can secure you a record deal.


1110
01:06:42.666 --> 01:06:45.208
Well, you're a stubborn sod.
I'll give you that.


1111
01:06:45.291 --> 01:06:46.750
Takes one to know one.

1112
01:06:48.125 --> 01:06:50.291
Now, who's up for a road trip?

A reservoir of seadogs?

1118
01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:07.708
Special offer was it, Father?
A pound a pair to avoid the glare?


1119
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.250
Remember what
the well-known Irish singer said, Jim.


1120
01:07:11.708 --> 01:07:14.416
"I may be plain old Paul Hewson
from Dublin.

Right, let's get this pub crawl started.

I had done in Manila.

1173
01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:50.875
Nineteen sixty-four.

1174
01:09:51.625 --> 01:09:54.500
I was on shore
leave in the merchant navy.

Him and half the British fleet.

to make a permanent declaration.

I've got to take this call. Hold on.

1219

Danny.

1220
01:12:01.583 --> 01:12:04.041
Yeah, Dan. I just, uh, just nodding off.

1221
01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:07.291
I got Rowan fast asleep
in the bed next to me.


1222
01:12:07.375 --> 01:12:08.375
Asleep?

1223
01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:11.791
We're supposed to be meeting up
for a spot of grub, Jim.


1224
01:12:11.875 --> 01:12:15.458
Oh, yeah, mate. Sorry about that.
We... We thought we should turn in.


1225
01:12:15.541 --> 01:12:17.750
All that sightseeing, see, did us over.

1226
01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.642
Are you sure you boys
haven't been out on the lash?


1227
01:12:19.666 --> 01:12:21.583
On the lash? No.

1228
01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:25.291
No, Danny. We're saving our voices
for the morning, see.


1229
01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:27.541
Glad to hear you're taking it seriously.
Listen.

All in. All in. All in.

1244
01:13:22.875 --> 01:13:25.333
Now, remember what John Lennon said, lads.

1245
01:13:25.416 --> 01:13:27.958
"A dream you dream
alone is only a dream.

1246
01:13:28.333 --> 01:13:31.166
A dream you dream together is reality."

1247

- Danny, did we have an appointment?
- No.


1270
01:15:04.916 --> 01:15:07.208
But it's your job to find great artists.

1271
01:15:07.291 --> 01:15:08.625
And I've got ten of 'em.

1272
01:15:08.708 --> 01:15:11.541
Meet Port Isaac's Fisherman's Friends.

1273
01:15:13.791 --> 01:15:14.791
We need a word.

1274
01:15:23.041 --> 01:15:25.833
Danny, we deal in originality.

1275
01:15:25.916 --> 01:15:26.916
Leah...

1276
01:15:27.875 --> 01:15:30.666
I guarantee you've never heard
anything like that before.


1277
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:32.916
The song they were singing
was about prostitution.


1278
01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:34.083
Yes.

1279
01:15:34.166 --> 01:15:37.000
So was "Roxanne."
That didn't work out too badly for Sting.


1280
01:15:39.416 --> 01:15:40.708
Look, come on, Leah.

1281
01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:45.250
We may live in the age of <i>The X Factor,</i>
but what that show has taught us


1282
01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:48.750
is that the public love to see
real people with real talent.


1283
01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:51.458
And it doesn't get any more real

1284
01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:55.666
than singing fishermen
who risk their lives out at sea every day.


1285
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:58.416
I mean, think of the marketing angles.

1286
01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:00.583
You won't just be signing a new act.

1287
01:16:00.666 --> 01:16:03.375
You'll be signing 500 years
of naval history.


1288
01:16:07.416 --> 01:16:09.208
I'm sorry, Danny.

1289
01:16:09.291 --> 01:16:11.875
You know how much ongoing business
we've got with Troy.


1290
01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:16.250
If I take a punt on Popeye and his pals,
I'd risk jeopardising that.


1291
01:16:17.083 --> 01:16:19.750
All I'm asking for
is a basic one-album deal.


1292
01:16:19.833 --> 01:16:21.083
You'll spend less on this

1293
01:16:21.166 --> 01:16:24.250
than you would on a music video
for one of your A-list artists.


1294
01:16:25.291 --> 01:16:26.833
- I'm sorry, Danny.
- Leah.


1295
01:16:27.458 --> 01:16:28.666
Maybe next time.

1296
01:16:40.916 --> 01:16:44.541
Don't be too hard on yourself, Danny.

1297
01:16:44.625 --> 01:16:46.500
You give it your best shot.

1298
01:16:47.083 --> 01:16:49.250
Wasn't good enough though, was it, Jago?

1299
01:16:49.333 --> 01:16:50.750
Hello, Danny?

1300
01:16:52.416 --> 01:16:53.416
Afternoon, Sian.

1301
01:16:54.125 --> 01:16:55.541
That was fantastic.

1302
01:16:55.625 --> 01:16:58.791
Shame the powers that be
didn't think so.


1303
01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.125
Well, I've got a TV show
that are looking for someone to step in


1304
01:17:02.208 --> 01:17:04.958
and sing the national anthem
for the queen's birthday next week.


1305
01:17:05.041 --> 01:17:07.708
We've had a last-minute dropout,
if you're interested.


1306
01:17:10.083 --> 01:17:12.083
Let me run it past the boys.

1307
01:17:15.375 --> 01:17:19.083
Look, I know
this isn't what we had in mind,


1308
01:17:19.166 --> 01:17:22.750
but this could be a golden opportunity
to reach a wider audience.


1309
01:17:27.166 --> 01:17:29.333
Jim, at least consider it.

1310
01:17:35.125 --> 01:17:38.083
Yeah, we'd be honoured to, my fair maiden.

1311
01:17:38.166 --> 01:17:39.208
We would?

1312
01:17:39.291 --> 01:17:40.625
We would.

1313
01:17:41.916 --> 01:17:45.916
And now to celebrate the queen's birthday,
something a little different.


1314
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:49.083
Singing the national anthem,

Yeah, so are all the people tuning in

1336
01:18:46.583 --> 01:18:50.041
And you've just gone and alienated
every single last one of them!


1337
01:18:50.125 --> 01:18:52.208
And spoiled our chances of a knighthood.

1338
01:18:52.291 --> 01:18:54.166
Come on.

1339
01:18:58.625 --> 01:19:01.416
That's it. I got nothing left.

1340
01:19:02.708 --> 01:19:07.458
Can you assure me
that it's always gonna be a public house?


1341
01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:10.625
That's certainly my intention, Rowan.

1342

We don't have a choice, love.

1343
01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:17.500
So, do we have
ourselves a deal, or what?

1344
01:19:27.250 --> 01:19:30.208
- What's going on?
- The inevitable.


1345
01:19:32.833 --> 01:19:34.833

1346
01:19:34.916 --> 01:19:36.208
Nobody does.

1347
01:19:37.041 --> 01:19:39.333
Rowan's gotta find
the right moment to explain.

I've known most of ees

1425

talk, fish,

1427
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:57.541

1428
01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:02.541
But you've given me back
so much more than I can...


1429
01:24:02.625 --> 01:24:04.750
- that I could ever...
- Oh, Dad.


1430
01:24:04.833 --> 01:24:07.541
Come on, guys.

1431
01:24:08.125 --> 01:24:09.291
I...

1432
01:24:10.041 --> 01:24:14.083
I'd like to say a
few words, if he can't.

1433
01:24:14.166 --> 01:24:18.208
When we first devised the plan
to escape the wives once a week


1434
01:24:18.291 --> 01:24:20.791

1435
01:24:21.291 --> 01:24:22.958
Speak for yourself, boy.

1436
01:24:23.041 --> 01:24:25.041
...all those years ago,

1437
01:24:25.125 --> 01:24:28.041
none of us would ever have believed
we'd end up with a record deal.


1438
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.041
I-I-I was the most sceptical,
I will admit that,


1439
01:24:33.125 --> 01:24:35.125
of anyone here.

1440
01:24:35.208 --> 01:24:36.833
It's all been down to the...

1441
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:40.416
the tenacity and belief of one man.

1442
01:24:41.625 --> 01:24:43.875
- Danny Anderson.
- Yeah!


1443
01:24:45.458 --> 01:24:49.666
So I'll make a toast.
To old friends and new.


1444
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.791

1446
01:25:12.791 --> 01:25:14.416
Mm-hmm.

1447
01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.375
And Rowan's dad, Kenwyn.

1448
01:25:17.208 --> 01:25:19.583
That's outside the old lifeboat station.

1449
01:25:20.458 --> 01:25:21.898
They were both part of the same crew

1450
01:25:21.958 --> 01:25:24.291
that answered an emergency call
at Hawker's Cove.


1451
01:25:25.166 --> 01:25:29.625
And during the rescue, a freak wave
hit the lifeboat and capsized it.


1452
01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.666
They were the only two members to survive.

1453
01:25:32.208 --> 01:25:34.291
Well, Kenwyn never got over it.

1454
01:25:34.375 --> 01:25:35.916
He didn't go out to sea again.

1455
01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.309
And then when the village
was granted a new lifeboat house,


1456
01:25:38.333 --> 01:25:41.500
then Kenwyn bought the old one
and turned it into the Golden Lion.


1457
01:25:42.958 --> 01:25:44.958
That's why it's so important to us all.

1458
01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.541

<i>- Henry?</i>

1461

New owners, did you say, was that?

What's that about new owners, Rowan?

1492
01:29:19.833 --> 01:29:21.666
I didn't have a choice, Jim.

1493
01:29:22.708 --> 01:29:25.416
There was no other
way to settle the debt.

1494
01:29:29.041 --> 01:29:31.958
Well, why didn't you come
and speak to me about it?


1495
01:29:32.041 --> 01:29:36.083
I wanted to tell you,
but what with the band and the baby and...


1496
01:29:36.166 --> 01:29:38.458
well, then your father, I...

1497
01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:42.583
- Th-There just hasn't been a right moment.
- Who bought it then?


1498
01:29:45.375 --> 01:29:47.416
Charles Montegue.

1499
01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.583
You sold it to that grabbin' bastard?

1500
01:29:49.666 --> 01:29:54.083
'Twas his ancestors who drove us overseas
and down the bloody mines.


1501
01:29:54.166 --> 01:29:57.416
He offered a fair price,
and he promised to keep it as a pub.


1502
01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.500
You've been a damn fool, Rowan.

1503
01:30:01.708 --> 01:30:04.875
Businessman like Charles Montegue...

1504
01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:09.041
he's not gonna want to
keep this place as it is.


1505
01:30:09.125 --> 01:30:11.291
He's gonna want to make
a tidy profit out of it.


1506
01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:16.958
That'll probably mean turning it into
one of them boutique hotels or summat.


1507
01:30:17.041 --> 01:30:20.125
There'll be no place here for us.
You do know that, don't you?


1508
01:30:20.208 --> 01:30:22.250
Well, that's not true. Is it, Danny?

1509
01:30:23.833 --> 01:30:26.750
- What's it got to do with Danny?
- Well, he made the introduction.


1510
01:30:32.333 --> 01:30:36.458
Rowan came to me for business advice.
He was in an impossible situation.


1511
01:30:37.291 --> 01:30:40.708
Oh, you... you went to an emmet?

1512
01:30:40.791 --> 01:30:42.375
In your hour of need?

1513
01:30:42.458 --> 01:30:46.708
Rowan and Sally
didn't make this decision easily, my son.


1514
01:30:46.791 --> 01:30:48.583
Wh... Y
-You knew?

1515
01:30:48.666 --> 01:30:51.375
Well, what else would you lot
want him to do?


1516
01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:53.666
Go bankrupt? Be homeless?

1517
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:56.208
Look, I'm sorry.

1518
01:30:56.291 --> 01:30:57.958
I was just trying to help.

1519
01:30:58.041 --> 01:31:00.708
You're only sorry
because you were found out.


1520
01:31:00.791 --> 01:31:04.250
You're just full of showbiz bullshit,
aren't you, son?


1521
01:31:04.333 --> 01:31:05.875
Huh?

1522
01:31:05.958 --> 01:31:10.375
With your million-pound record deals
and your fake handshakes and all that.


1523
01:31:10.458 --> 01:31:12.750
Jim, look. Listen, just hear me out.

1524
01:31:12.833 --> 01:31:15.541
When I spoke to Rowan,
I didn't know anything about the pub,


1525
01:31:15.625 --> 01:31:17.666
its history,
or what it means to the community.


1526
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:19.666
But you know now because I told you.

1527
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:22.333
Yeah, but by then
the deal had already gone through.


1528
01:31:22.416 --> 01:31:24.500
So you were getting a cut, were you?

1529
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.791
And you didn't want to risk
losing your commission.


1530
01:31:28.875 --> 01:31:31.333
No, Alwyn, wait.

1531
01:31:41.458 --> 01:31:43.583
Alwyn!

1532
01:31:44.375 --> 01:31:45.791
Let me explain!

1533
01:31:53.083 --> 01:31:55.583
Alwyn, please, just hear me out!

1534
01:31:57.791 --> 01:31:59.151
Keep your voice down.

1535
01:31:59.208 --> 01:32:01.958
Go away, Danny. I'm not interested
in anything you've got to say.


1536
01:32:02.041 --> 01:32:04.291
No, wait, wait! Look, um...

1537
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:07.333
I
-I
-I'm gonna talk to Charles.

1538
01:32:07.416 --> 01:32:09.375
I
-I'll make sure things don't change.

1539
01:32:09.458 --> 01:32:11.125
Everything's changed.

1540
01:32:16.041 --> 01:32:18.083
Cornish oak, my ass.

1541
01:32:19.041 --> 01:32:22.833
Your word is like... 
It's like willow...

1542
01:32:23.541 --> 01:32:25.625
blowing in the wind.

1543
01:32:25.708 --> 01:32:26.708
Yeah.

1544
01:32:26.791 --> 01:32:30.750
I warned you
not to take the piss out of us.


1545
01:32:30.833 --> 01:32:34.291
And I warned you
not to hurt my daughter.

1546
01:32:34.375 --> 01:32:36.875
It wasn't intentional, Jim. I promise.

1547
01:32:36.958 --> 01:32:39.541
I think it might be time
for you to leave, Danny.


1548
01:32:40.916 --> 01:32:45.333
Unless you want me to drag you
through the River Tamar myself.

Mmm. When is the world's oldest boy band
shuffling into shops?


1581
01:34:55.875 --> 01:34:58.541
The album is released on Friday.

Oh, man. No pressure, right?

1583

Only up against Lady Gaga, Paul Weller,

- Why on earth not?


1598
01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:02.950
Because I'd like something else instead.

1599
01:36:29.125 --> 01:36:31.166
Come on, Dad.

1600
01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:33.291
This isn't the time to be stubborn.

1601
01:36:33.375 --> 01:36:35.375
It's Rowan and Sally's
last day at the pub.


1602
01:36:35.458 --> 01:36:38.416
No, I'm... I'm in
no mood for a drink.

1603
01:36:39.208 --> 01:36:42.083
Don't you think you've made your point?

1604
01:36:42.166 --> 01:36:44.208
Rowan has torn the heart
out of this village.


1605
01:36:46.291 --> 01:36:48.875
The heart of the village isn't the pub,
Dad.


1606
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:51.166
It's the people.

1607
01:37:14.500 --> 01:37:16.500
I owe you an apology, Rowan.

1608
01:37:17.583 --> 01:37:19.583
I
-I've been a stubborn fool.

1609
01:37:20.583 --> 01:37:23.458
You did what you did
for the sake of your family,


1610
01:37:23.541 --> 01:37:26.333
and I should never have let that
come between us.


1611
01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:29.083
I'm sorry.

1612
01:37:31.083 --> 01:37:32.916
One and all?

1613
01:37:34.583 --> 01:37:36.000
One and all.

1614
01:37:40.916 --> 01:37:42.166
- The usual?
- Yeah.


1615
01:37:42.250 --> 01:37:44.208
That's more like it, mate.

1616
01:37:57.708 --> 01:38:00.125
Come on. Come on!

1617
01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:03.916
Top 40's on in a minute.

1618
01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.416
I'd tune into the top
400 if I were you.

1619
01:38:08.166 --> 01:38:10.333
- Dad!
- Don't be such a pessimist!


1620
01:38:14.416 --> 01:38:16.000
Danny!

1621
01:38:16.083 --> 01:38:17.833
Tamsyn. Oh.

1622
01:38:18.625 --> 01:38:20.500
I missed you.

1623
01:38:20.583 --> 01:38:22.583
What you doing here then?

1624
01:38:31.458 --> 01:38:34.916
I came here to tell you that the pub is
gonna remain the way it always has been.


1625
01:38:36.375 --> 01:38:38.083
How's that possible?

1626
01:38:40.750 --> 01:38:42.166
Because I bought it.

1627
01:38:44.083 --> 01:38:45.833
Well, in case you've forgotten,

1628
01:38:45.916 --> 01:38:48.250
we're not too fond
of second-home owners round here.


1629
01:38:48.333 --> 01:38:50.333
Well, that's good,
because I've only got one.


1630
01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:56.833
I gave Charles Montegue my London flat
in exchange for this.


1631
01:38:59.166 --> 01:39:01.666
And I'd like Rowan and Sally
to keep it running.


1632
01:39:02.416 --> 01:39:04.333
Did you hear that?

1633
01:39:07.916 --> 01:39:09.333
Alwyn, wait.

1634
01:39:10.958 --> 01:39:12.541
Alwyn, uh, wait.

1635
01:39:12.625 --> 01:39:14.875
- Wait, please.
- What are you doing, Danny?


1636
01:39:16.291 --> 01:39:17.934
Just because
you made things right with the pub,


1637
01:39:17.958 --> 01:39:20.166
that doesn't mean
you made things right with me.


1638
01:39:20.250 --> 01:39:22.083
I'm not expecting anything.

1639
01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:28.375
I want you to know that I've done a lot
of thinking over the last few months.


1640
01:39:29.791 --> 01:39:31.625
Everything I thought I cared about...

1641
01:39:32.708 --> 01:39:36.916
money, status,
the flat, the cars, the toys...


1642
01:39:40.041 --> 01:39:41.625
none of them have ever made me happy.

1643
01:39:44.833 --> 01:39:47.708
But being down here
with you and Tamsyn did.


1644
01:39:49.583 --> 01:39:51.625
Come on, you two!

1645
01:39:51.708 --> 01:39:54.166
You're missing the countdown. Come on!

1646
