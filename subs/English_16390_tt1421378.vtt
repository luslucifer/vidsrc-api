1
00:01:04.424 --> 00:01:05.676
Huh?

2
00:01:21.358 --> 00:01:23.907
Kenji. Kenji.
Aah!


3
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:29.459
I'm paying you to clean the floors,
not stare off into space.


4
00:01:29.658 --> 00:01:33.708
I am sorry, Takagawa san,
but I got distracted.


5
00:01:35.122 --> 00:01:41.095
Sadly, that is why no one comes
to the museum anymore.


6
00:01:42.045 --> 00:01:44.673
Too many distractions.
No discipline.


7
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:48.135
No respect for the old ways.

8
00:01:48.343 --> 00:01:50.345
Come with me. I will show you.

9
00:01:50.554 --> 00:01:53.103
But I saw...

10
00:02:05.694 --> 00:02:10.916
Behold, the Black Samurai.

11
00:02:16.037 --> 00:02:19.041
The Black Samurai.

12
00:02:19.249 --> 00:02:21.502
Never heard of him.

13
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.964
The most fearsome warlord
in the history of Japan.


14
00:02:25.172 --> 00:02:28.176
Do you see what I am
getting at, Kenji?


15
00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:30.223
Uh...

16
00:02:30.427 --> 00:02:32.350
Yes, Takagawa san.

17
00:02:32.554 --> 00:02:34.602
You want me to mop in here.

18
00:02:34.806 --> 00:02:40.404
No, that this exhibit
could save the museum.


19
00:02:49.696 --> 00:02:51.198
What is happening?

20
00:03:15.138 --> 00:03:16.936
I live.

21
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.768
Kenji, do something.

22
00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:21.273
<i>Bonsai!</i>

23
00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:26.324
Uh?

24
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:51.638
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.


25
00:05:12.923 --> 00:05:15.301
<i>Welcome to Shibuya Station.</i>

26
00:05:15.508 --> 00:05:17.761
<i>Now arriving on Track 5.</i>

27
00:05:19.387 --> 00:05:21.230
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

28
00:05:49.167 --> 00:05:51.716
Wow, we made it, gang.

29
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.217
Shibuya Station.

30
00:05:53.421 --> 00:05:56.220
The most popular meeting
place in all of Tokyo.


31
00:05:56.424 --> 00:05:57.767
And I can see why.

32
00:05:57.968 --> 00:06:00.346
Everyone in Japan
is already here.


33
00:06:01.096 --> 00:06:02.598
But, like, wouldn't you know it?

34
00:06:02.806 --> 00:06:05.685
We're all out of Scooby Snacks.

35
00:06:19.614 --> 00:06:22.788
Scooby Snacks. 
Scooby Snacks.

36
00:06:22.993 --> 00:06:25.746
Way to go, Scoob.
A Scooby Snack vending machine.


37
00:06:27.205 --> 00:06:28.923
Like, it's the wave
of the future.


38
00:06:34.713 --> 00:06:37.011
Hey, I've got a text
message from Miyumi.


39
00:06:37.215 --> 00:06:40.845
She says, "Meet me at
the statue of Hachiko."


40
00:06:41.052 --> 00:06:43.896
Any idea what this Hachiko person
looks like?


41
00:06:44.097 --> 00:06:47.101
Let's see.
Hachiko. Hachiko.


42
00:06:47.308 --> 00:06:49.276
Hachiko. Take a picture.

43
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.568
Hachiko.

44
00:06:56.735 --> 00:06:58.328
Like, check it out, Scoob.

45
00:06:58.528 --> 00:07:00.781
Hachiko's not a person,
he's a pooch.


46
00:07:00.989 --> 00:07:02.036
Here it is.

47
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.790
Hachiko used to greet his master every
day when he came home on the train.


48
00:07:05.994 --> 00:07:07.246
One day his master died...

49
00:07:07.454 --> 00:07:09.673
...and Hachiko
spent the rest of his life...


50
00:07:09.873 --> 00:07:13.093
...waiting at the station
for his master to return.


51
00:07:13.585 --> 00:07:17.135
Wow, sounds like
he was one cool canine.


52
00:07:17.338 --> 00:07:21.559
Heh, heh. Hey, Scoob. Like, maybe
they'll put up a statue of you some day.


53
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.933
Me? Oh, boy.

54
00:07:26.014 --> 00:07:30.064
Ta-da. Bow-wow. Ruff.

55
00:07:30.268 --> 00:07:32.942
Look at Scooby. What a ham.

56
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.739
It's going to take more than that.
Huh?


57
00:07:42.947 --> 00:07:45.370
If you want to have a statue
of your own in Japan...


58
00:07:45.575 --> 00:07:48.249
...you must first become a legend.

59
00:07:48.453 --> 00:07:50.421
Just like Hachiko.

60
00:07:50.622 --> 00:07:53.171
Today, in honor of
his great loyalty...


61
00:07:53.374 --> 00:07:58.676
...his statue serves as a special
place for faithful friends to meet.


62
00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:01.383
Uh, I'm sorry, but have we met?

63
00:08:01.591 --> 00:08:03.434
Huh! You must be Miyumi.

64
00:08:03.635 --> 00:08:06.104
And you are Miss Daphne Blake.

65
00:08:06.304 --> 00:08:09.433
I have heard all about you
and the Scooby gang.


66
00:08:09.641 --> 00:08:11.109
What do you know, Scoob?

67
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:14.859
Looks like our
reputation precedes us.


68
00:08:15.105 --> 00:08:17.449
Like, I hope that's a good thing.

69
00:08:17.649 --> 00:08:20.027
Heh-heh-heh.
Of course it is.


70
00:08:20.235 --> 00:08:21.657
Can I tell you a secret?

71
00:08:21.861 --> 00:08:25.786
I sometimes wish I could be a
member of the Scooby gang too.


72
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:27.082
Like, tell you what.

73
00:08:27.283 --> 00:08:31.538
Next time there's a gruesome ghost up
in our grill, you've got first dibs.


74
00:08:31.746 --> 00:08:33.623
Uh-huh.

75
00:08:33.832 --> 00:08:35.505
Hey, don't worry, guys.

76
00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:38.052
We're not here to solve
any mysteries this time.


77
00:08:38.253 --> 00:08:41.974
We're here to watch Daphne compete
in the big martial-arts competition.


78
00:08:42.173 --> 00:08:44.972
I'm so honored
to be invited to the tournament.


79
00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:46.598
And so should you be.

80
00:08:46.803 --> 00:08:51.650
Miss Mirimoto runs the most exclusive
martial-arts academy in all the world.


81
00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.229
Only the most exemplary students
are accepted by her.


82
00:08:55.436 --> 00:08:59.566
But first, you must survive
the tournament.


83
00:09:01.025 --> 00:09:03.119
Survive?

84
00:09:03.862 --> 00:09:07.992
Oh, I'm sorry. Did I say "survive"?
Ha, ha. I meant "win."


85
00:09:08.199 --> 00:09:10.247
First, you must win
the tournament.


86
00:09:25.425 --> 00:09:27.098
Wow, what a sweet ride.

87
00:09:27.302 --> 00:09:30.476
All it needs
is a groovy green paint job.


88
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.557
Uh, not quite, Freddy.

89
00:09:32.765 --> 00:09:34.813
I can think of one
more thing it needs.


90
00:09:35.018 --> 00:09:37.396
Like, how about a pilot?

91
00:09:37.604 --> 00:09:40.323
Huh?
Don't worry. We're perfectly safe.


92
00:09:40.523 --> 00:09:46.075
The hover jet is the world's first
fully functioning robotic plane.


93
00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:47.622
That's amazing.

94
00:09:47.822 --> 00:09:49.870
I've studied mechanical
engineering...


95
00:09:50.074 --> 00:09:52.497
...but I've never heard
of anything this advanced.


96
00:09:52.702 --> 00:09:55.376
Here in Japan, technology is
taking over everything...


97
00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.130
...while many of the old
traditions are fading away.


98
00:10:21.105 --> 00:10:25.656
Please, Miss Mirimoto,
you must believe me.


99
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:29.080
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.


100
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.035
Soon, he will come
for the Destiny Scroll.


101
00:10:36.287 --> 00:10:40.258
A very entertaining story,
Mr. Takagawa.


102
00:10:40.458 --> 00:10:45.589
I am sure that it will bring many
new visitors to see your exhibit.


103
00:10:45.797 --> 00:10:50.098
Now, as you can see, our grand
tournament is about to begin.


104
00:10:50.301 --> 00:10:53.976
We would be most pleased
to have you join us.


105
00:10:54.180 --> 00:11:01.109
Sojo, please show our
honored guest to his seat.


106
00:11:01.312 --> 00:11:02.814
You must listen.

107
00:11:04.941 --> 00:11:07.285
The scroll...

108
00:11:07.735 --> 00:11:11.035
...must be protected.

109
00:11:11.239 --> 00:11:13.583
I can assure you, Mr. Takagawa...

110
00:11:13.783 --> 00:11:15.410
...ghost or no ghost...

111
00:11:15.618 --> 00:11:20.715
...the Destiny Scroll will be
quite safe behind these walls.


112
00:11:20.915 --> 00:11:24.089
If you say so.

113
00:11:24.627 --> 00:11:27.426
Sojo. Release him.

114
00:11:30.967 --> 00:11:33.345
You must forgive poor Sojo.

115
00:11:33.553 --> 00:11:35.806
He does only as he is told.

116
00:11:36.014 --> 00:11:39.393
His loyalty to me
is unquestioned.


117
00:11:42.103 --> 00:11:43.480
The plane.

118
00:11:43.688 --> 00:11:45.736
The plane.

119
00:11:52.488 --> 00:11:56.038
Ah, the last of our
guests to arrive.


120
00:11:56.242 --> 00:11:58.961
Have them report
to the staging ground immediately.


121
00:11:59.162 --> 00:12:02.257
We shall have a demonstration.

122
00:12:09.547 --> 00:12:12.391
Wow, what a beautiful airport.

123
00:12:12.592 --> 00:12:14.720
It's not an airport, Freddy.

124
00:12:14.927 --> 00:12:17.771
This is a traditional
Japanese garden.


125
00:12:20.892 --> 00:12:24.522
Can't you just feel the peace
and tranquility?


126
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.652
Oh, yeah.

127
00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:34.990
Scoob, old buddy, like, from here
on out, no matter what happens...


128
00:12:35.198 --> 00:12:37.951
...I'm just gonna
go with the flow.


129
00:12:38.159 --> 00:12:41.333
Go with the flow.

130
00:12:41.537 --> 00:12:44.006
All must Wear uniform.

131
00:12:44.207 --> 00:12:48.178
Gulp! Like, my go-with-the-flow
just got up and went.


132
00:12:48.377 --> 00:12:49.845
Zoinks!

133
00:12:56.719 --> 00:12:59.017
No, Sojo. Bad, Sojo.

134
00:12:59.222 --> 00:13:02.066
Not them. Her.

135
00:13:02.266 --> 00:13:04.735
All must Wear uniform.

136
00:13:04.936 --> 00:13:06.688
Hyah!
Aah!


137
00:13:10.233 --> 00:13:13.908
Sorry, Sojo, but I handle
my own wardrobe.


138
00:13:19.242 --> 00:13:21.210
Ha-ha-ha. Check it out, Scoob.

139
00:13:21.411 --> 00:13:23.288
Like, it's a carnival of karate.

140
00:13:23.496 --> 00:13:25.169
Ooh! Uh-huh.

141
00:13:25.373 --> 00:13:27.967
The competition this
year is fierce.


142
00:13:28.167 --> 00:13:32.718
That's Kerry Kilpatrick,
the Irish national champion.


143
00:13:34.674 --> 00:13:37.678
He's a two-fisted
demolition dynamo.


144
00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:40.517
- Hyah!
- Sapphire Sonja.


145
00:13:40.721 --> 00:13:45.227
The only thing deadlier than
her kick is her beauty.


146
00:13:45.893 --> 00:13:47.566
- Rah!
- Zoinks!


147
00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:51.070
And that's Japan's own
Mad Dog Masimoto.


148
00:13:51.274 --> 00:13:53.151
A favorite to win this year.

149
00:13:53.359 --> 00:13:56.579
Once he's off his leash,
you're really in the doghouse.


150
00:14:02.201 --> 00:14:03.453
Huh!

151
00:14:17.717 --> 00:14:18.809
Gee whiz.

152
00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.980
Like, talk about a creep
with a canine complex.


153
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.227
Yeah.

154
00:14:29.562 --> 00:14:32.486
Most honored participants...

155
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:37.912
...welcome to Mirimoto Academy's
Tournament of Champions.


156
00:14:38.112 --> 00:14:40.831
The finest martial artists
in all the world...


157
00:14:41.032 --> 00:14:45.583
...have gathered here today
for one single purpose:


158
00:14:45.786 --> 00:14:49.541
to prove that they are the best.

159
00:14:52.001 --> 00:14:53.924
By this time tomorrow...

160
00:14:54.128 --> 00:14:59.726
...most of you will be sent home
in humiliating defeat.


161
00:15:03.221 --> 00:15:04.848
But there is one among you...

162
00:15:05.056 --> 00:15:09.027
...who has already displayed
the heart of a champion.


163
00:15:09.227 --> 00:15:11.855
Miss Daphne Blake?

164
00:15:14.524 --> 00:15:16.242
Um, over here.

165
00:15:16.442 --> 00:15:17.989
Hello.

166
00:15:18.194 --> 00:15:19.787
Can this be?

167
00:15:19.987 --> 00:15:21.785
The tournament has
not yet begun...


168
00:15:21.989 --> 00:15:26.335
...and already you have defeated
the mighty Sojo.


169
00:15:26.536 --> 00:15:29.915
I didn't mean to.
It's just that-- Eh--


170
00:15:30.122 --> 00:15:32.124
This is most impressive.

171
00:15:32.333 --> 00:15:34.085
Perhaps you would honor us...

172
00:15:34.293 --> 00:15:38.014
...with a demonstration
of your superior skill.


173
00:15:38.214 --> 00:15:40.342
As in right now?

174
00:15:40.549 --> 00:15:45.225
Your opponent will always attack
when you least expect it.


175
00:16:15.835 --> 00:16:17.087
Huh?

176
00:16:24.719 --> 00:16:28.895
Like, meow. Talk about a
kung-fu cat-fight, ha.


177
00:16:29.098 --> 00:16:31.226
Uh-huh. Meow.

178
00:16:52.705 --> 00:16:55.834
My hair band. I can't see.

179
00:16:58.002 --> 00:17:01.131
Hey, that was a dirty trick.

180
00:17:01.339 --> 00:17:03.592
The first rule of
Mirimoto Academy:


181
00:17:03.799 --> 00:17:04.846
If you want to win...

182
00:17:05.051 --> 00:17:09.147
...you must be willing to do that
which others are not willing to do.


183
00:17:09.847 --> 00:17:12.100
Most impressive, Miss Blake.

184
00:17:12.308 --> 00:17:13.935
You lack proper training...

185
00:17:14.143 --> 00:17:18.819
...but I see in you
much potential.


186
00:17:20.649 --> 00:17:23.744
The tournament begins tomorrow
at sunrise...


187
00:17:23.945 --> 00:17:29.122
...but tonight, a feast has
been prepared in your honor.


188
00:17:32.078 --> 00:17:33.170
Hear that, Scoob?

189
00:17:33.371 --> 00:17:34.873
Like, a feast in our honor.

190
00:17:35.081 --> 00:17:36.458
Oh, boy.

191
00:17:37.917 --> 00:17:41.842
Finally, something
worth fighting for.


192
00:18:10.449 --> 00:18:13.544
Boy, the service here is great...

193
00:18:14.537 --> 00:18:18.292
...but, uh, our waitress
sure could use a suntan.


194
00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:21.594
She's not a waitress, Freddy.
She's a geisha girl.


195
00:18:21.794 --> 00:18:26.265
Geisha, the ancient Japanese tradition
celebrating exquisite beauty.


196
00:18:26.465 --> 00:18:29.264
Speaking of beauty,
check out the buffet table.


197
00:18:29.468 --> 00:18:30.515
Oh, ho, ho!

198
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.600
It's like there's a party in my
stomach and everything's invited.


199
00:18:34.807 --> 00:18:35.854
Yeah.

200
00:18:40.813 --> 00:18:41.939
Hyah!

201
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.625
Ha-ha-ha. Like, you must be
a black belt in kung food.


202
00:18:54.076 --> 00:18:55.123
Yeah.

203
00:18:56.787 --> 00:19:00.917
Forget the karate chop.
Like, check out my karate chomp.


204
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.388
Huh?

205
00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:09.383
Huh! Ninjas!

206
00:19:20.311 --> 00:19:24.737
Wow, real-life ninjas. How cool.

207
00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.113
I don't think these guys
are part of the act.


208
00:19:29.111 --> 00:19:30.203
Watch out.

209
00:19:31.947 --> 00:19:33.915
If it's a fight you
be looking for...


210
00:19:34.116 --> 00:19:36.665
...then you've found the bloke
to oblige you.


211
00:19:41.874 --> 00:19:43.171
Out of my way.

212
00:19:43.375 --> 00:19:46.845
Let Sapphire Sonja
show you how to kick it.


213
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:01.857
Hmm?

214
00:20:17.993 --> 00:20:19.290
We're surrounded.

215
00:20:35.427 --> 00:20:36.474
Who's that?

216
00:20:36.679 --> 00:20:39.478
Gulp! Who cares?
Not me.


217
00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:42.727
Let's get out of here.

218
00:21:49.126 --> 00:21:50.594
Huh?

219
00:21:58.385 --> 00:21:59.807
Huh?

220
00:22:40.177 --> 00:22:41.599
Yipes!

221
00:22:41.804 --> 00:22:44.057
Like, I almost forgot.

222
00:22:44.265 --> 00:22:46.643
We're afraid of heights.

223
00:22:55.943 --> 00:22:58.913
Shaggy, look.

224
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:05.127
At long last...

225
00:23:05.327 --> 00:23:10.925
...the Destiny Scroll is mine.

226
00:23:13.961 --> 00:23:16.339
Stop, thief.
Huh?


227
00:23:17.756 --> 00:23:20.635
You will not be
allowed to escape.


228
00:23:25.097 --> 00:23:27.225
You are too late.

229
00:23:27.433 --> 00:23:30.277
We shall let steel decide.

230
00:23:46.493 --> 00:23:47.540
Yipes!

231
00:23:59.673 --> 00:24:03.018
The Black Samurai
will live again...


232
00:24:03.218 --> 00:24:05.516
...forever!

233
00:24:12.186 --> 00:24:13.233
So it is true.

234
00:24:13.437 --> 00:24:16.816
The ghost of the Black Samurai
has returned.


235
00:24:17.024 --> 00:24:19.948
Gulp! Ghost?

236
00:24:21.612 --> 00:24:23.205
It just doesn't add up.

237
00:24:23.405 --> 00:24:26.079
The artwork in this collection
must be worth a fortune.


238
00:24:26.283 --> 00:24:29.833
So why go through all that trouble
just to steal one scroll?


239
00:24:30.037 --> 00:24:32.005
Well, gang,
it looks like we've landed...


240
00:24:32.206 --> 00:24:35.335
...smack dab
in the middle of another mystery.


241
00:24:35.542 --> 00:24:38.170
It is no mystery.

242
00:24:39.046 --> 00:24:44.143
The legend of the Black Samurai
has been told for centuries.


243
00:24:44.343 --> 00:24:47.062
May I present
Mr. Takagawa...


244
00:24:47.262 --> 00:24:52.439
...most honored curator from the
Tokyo Museum of Cultural History.


245
00:24:52.935 --> 00:24:54.858
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Takagawa.


246
00:24:55.062 --> 00:24:56.564
You'll have to excuse us.

247
00:24:56.772 --> 00:24:59.491
We don't really know much
about Japanese folklore.


248
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:01.739
But ghosts are kind
of our specialty.


249
00:25:01.944 --> 00:25:03.662
Speak for yourself.

250
00:25:03.862 --> 00:25:07.116
My specialty is a triple-decker
Scooby Snack-and-ice-cream...


251
00:25:07.324 --> 00:25:08.826
...with-chocolate-sauce sandwich.

252
00:25:09.034 --> 00:25:11.162
Ha, ha. Mine too.

253
00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:12.417
Yum, yum, yum.

254
00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.708
The legend began
hundreds of years ago...


255
00:25:15.916 --> 00:25:19.295
...when fierce warriors
known as the samurai...


256
00:25:19.503 --> 00:25:24.600
...served the warlords of Japan
with absolute loyalty.


257
00:25:25.217 --> 00:25:27.265
<i>The most fearsome of all...</i>

258
00:25:27.469 --> 00:25:30.939
<i>...were the ronin, the samurai
who had lost his master.</i>


259
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.520
<i>Set adrift, like a wave
on the open sea.</i>


260
00:25:37.896 --> 00:25:42.823
<i>One ronin sought out
the master swordmaker Masamune.</i>


261
00:25:43.027 --> 00:25:46.827
<i>The legendary master agreed
to forge the samurai...</i>


262
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:50.079
<i>...a sword of great
mystical power...</i>


263
00:25:50.284 --> 00:25:55.586
<i>...but it would take an entire
year to complete the work.</i>


264
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:59.134
<i>The master's evil-minded
apprentice, Muramasa...</i>


265
00:25:59.334 --> 00:26:06.263
<i>...offered to forge him another
sword, but in only half the time.</i>


266
00:26:13.849 --> 00:26:15.943
<i>The samurai returned...</i>

267
00:26:16.143 --> 00:26:19.067
<i>...and upon drawing the blade...</i>

268
00:26:19.271 --> 00:26:23.242
<i>...felt a surge of
uncontrollable dark power.</i>


269
00:26:23.442 --> 00:26:28.699
<i>The evil spirit of the apprentice
had passed into the blade itself.</i>


270
00:26:28.906 --> 00:26:31.125
<i>It was a sword of hatred.</i>

271
00:26:31.325 --> 00:26:33.168
<i>A sword of darkness.</i>

272
00:26:33.368 --> 00:26:36.372
<i>A Sword of Doom.</i>

273
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:42.678
<i>And in that moment was born
the Black Samurai.</i>


274
00:26:46.715 --> 00:26:50.561
<i>Finally,
the master's blade was complete.</i>


275
00:26:50.761 --> 00:26:54.356
<i>He named it the Sword of Fate...</i>

276
00:26:54.556 --> 00:27:00.404
<i>...and entrusted its mystical
power to a fearsome green dragon.</i>


277
00:27:00.604 --> 00:27:04.905
<i>Heaven and earth trembled
as the two great swords clashed.</i>


278
00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:12.624
<i>Until, using his sacred magic...</i>

279
00:27:12.825 --> 00:27:16.455
<i>...the Green Dragon
defeated the Black Samurai...</i>


280
00:27:16.662 --> 00:27:22.169
<i>...imprisoning him forever
within the Sword of Doom.</i>


281
00:27:22.376 --> 00:27:26.552
No!

282
00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:34.769
Centuries passed,
and the story faded into legend.


283
00:27:34.972 --> 00:27:38.397
Wow, Mr. Takagawa,
that's some story.


284
00:27:39.685 --> 00:27:43.360
Like, story nothing.
That sounds more like a nightmare.


285
00:27:43.564 --> 00:27:45.532
Yeah.

286
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:50.280
But what does all of this have
to do with the Destiny Scroll?


287
00:27:50.487 --> 00:27:53.661
The Destiny Scroll
holds the only clue...


288
00:27:53.865 --> 00:27:57.620
...to the secret location
of the Sword of Doom...


289
00:27:57.828 --> 00:28:01.378
...in the form of
an ancient riddle.


290
00:28:01.582 --> 00:28:04.131
If the ghost can solve
the riddle of the scroll...


291
00:28:04.334 --> 00:28:06.302
...he will reclaim
the Sword of Doom...


292
00:28:06.503 --> 00:28:09.882
...and free his evil spirit.

293
00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:12.513
If only we'd gotten a good look
at that scroll...


294
00:28:12.718 --> 00:28:15.096
...maybe we could have solved
the riddle first.


295
00:28:15.303 --> 00:28:18.603
Yeah, like, too bad
the scroll is gone.


296
00:28:18.807 --> 00:28:21.230
Aw, too bad.

297
00:28:21.435 --> 00:28:24.484
Heh-heh-heh. Guess that's
the end of this mystery.


298
00:28:24.688 --> 00:28:28.534
No, my friends,
the mystery has only begun.


299
00:28:33.989 --> 00:28:39.086
Huh! The Destiny Scroll.

300
00:28:40.329 --> 00:28:42.252
So the other scroll was a fake.

301
00:28:42.456 --> 00:28:45.050
Ha, ha. Psyche.

302
00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:49.380
Yes, but the Black Samurai
will soon realize the deception...


303
00:28:49.588 --> 00:28:51.682
...and return.

304
00:28:53.675 --> 00:28:56.224
I will translate the inscription.

305
00:28:56.428 --> 00:29:02.401
"The journey of a thousand miles
begins with a single step.


306
00:29:02.601 --> 00:29:05.730
The paper dragon shows the way."

307
00:29:05.937 --> 00:29:08.486
The journey of a
thousand miles...


308
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:11.239
Begins with a single step?

309
00:29:11.443 --> 00:29:14.822
The paper dragon shows the way.

310
00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:16.907
I've got it.

311
00:29:17.115 --> 00:29:18.617
Like, check it out, Scoob.

312
00:29:18.825 --> 00:29:22.045
An origami octopus. Beat that.
Ha-ha-ha.


313
00:29:22.245 --> 00:29:23.713
Hmm...

314
00:29:27.042 --> 00:29:29.010
Look. Snowflakes.

315
00:29:32.422 --> 00:29:37.269
That's it. The paper dragon
must be a reference to origami...


316
00:29:37.469 --> 00:29:39.813
...the Japanese art
of folding paper.


317
00:29:40.013 --> 00:29:41.731
Velma's right.

318
00:29:41.932 --> 00:29:47.405
Okay, guys, give us an origami
dragon but this time use the scroll.


319
00:29:47.854 --> 00:29:49.071
No.

320
00:29:49.564 --> 00:29:52.613
Just a little tuck
here, a fold there.


321
00:29:52.818 --> 00:29:56.539
This goes under, that goes over.

322
00:29:59.366 --> 00:30:00.583
Ta-da!

323
00:30:02.244 --> 00:30:04.542
The words have been rearranged.

324
00:30:04.746 --> 00:30:06.965
Yes. It now reads:

325
00:30:07.165 --> 00:30:11.796
"The journey begins
with a thousand steps."


326
00:30:12.003 --> 00:30:14.847
The journey begins
with a thousand steps?


327
00:30:15.048 --> 00:30:16.391
How is that any different?

328
00:30:16.591 --> 00:30:19.845
Hang on, gang.
I think I've got something.


329
00:30:20.053 --> 00:30:22.772
The Temple of a Thousand Steps.

330
00:30:23.515 --> 00:30:24.767
Huh?

331
00:30:24.975 --> 00:30:30.448
An ancient ruin located on a remote
jungle island in the South Pacific Ocean.


332
00:30:30.647 --> 00:30:32.274
Yes. I've got it too.

333
00:30:32.482 --> 00:30:34.860
The island temple is devoted to...

334
00:30:36.319 --> 00:30:39.038
...the Green Dragon.

335
00:30:39.239 --> 00:30:42.618
The Sword of Doom
must be hidden in the temple.


336
00:30:42.826 --> 00:30:46.205
Then we've gotta find a way
to get to that island.


337
00:30:46.413 --> 00:30:48.836
<i>Sojo, ready the hover jet.
Hai.</i>


338
00:30:49.041 --> 00:30:54.218
Miyumi will accompany you on your
journey as my representative.


339
00:30:54.421 --> 00:30:56.389
Huh! Thank you, sensei.

340
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:01.721
Mr. Takagawa, you will go along
as the team's translation expert.


341
00:31:01.928 --> 00:31:05.148
I will serve with distinction.

342
00:31:05.348 --> 00:31:08.192
A tropical-island vacation
in the sunny South Pacific?


343
00:31:09.811 --> 00:31:11.905
Like, now you're speaking
our language.


344
00:31:12.105 --> 00:31:13.573
Uh-huh.

345
00:31:22.449 --> 00:31:24.122
We should be getting close.

346
00:31:24.326 --> 00:31:27.125
I've uploaded the coordinates
into the navigation system...


347
00:31:27.329 --> 00:31:30.128
...using my laptop's
wireless interface.


348
00:31:30.582 --> 00:31:33.506
It's very exciting for me
to join you on this mystery.


349
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.839
I'm usually not allowed to venture
so far from Miss Mirimoto.


350
00:31:37.047 --> 00:31:39.846
She seems like a
really great sensei.


351
00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:41.097
She is...

352
00:31:41.301 --> 00:31:44.931
...but she demands absolute
loyalty, like that of a samurai.


353
00:31:45.138 --> 00:31:46.185
Indeed.

354
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:49.689
Someone who still cares
for the old ways.


355
00:31:49.893 --> 00:31:52.112
Yeah, like, the good old days...

356
00:31:52.312 --> 00:31:55.191
...when people chased each
other around with big swords.


357
00:31:55.398 --> 00:31:59.494
Pardon my saying so, but that
puts the mental in sentimental.


358
00:31:59.694 --> 00:32:01.162
Uh-huh.

359
00:32:05.742 --> 00:32:06.914
Here we go, gang.

360
00:32:12.582 --> 00:32:14.300
I can't see anything.

361
00:32:14.501 --> 00:32:17.380
It's like the whole world
just disappeared.


362
00:32:17.587 --> 00:32:21.888
Zoinks! Like, so much for our
sunny South Pacific vacation.


363
00:32:22.092 --> 00:32:25.187
The island should be right
in front of us.


364
00:32:25.887 --> 00:32:27.309
Whoa!

365
00:32:35.272 --> 00:32:37.195
Look, gang. There it is.

366
00:32:37.607 --> 00:32:41.237
The Temple of a Thousand Steps.

367
00:32:43.989 --> 00:32:46.287
Nine hundred and ninety-seven.

368
00:32:46.491 --> 00:32:48.710
Nine hundred and ninety-eight.

369
00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:51.208
Nine hundred and ninety-nine.

370
00:32:51.913 --> 00:32:53.256
One thousand.

371
00:32:53.456 --> 00:32:55.424
Phew! We made it, Scoob.

372
00:32:56.876 --> 00:33:00.301
Like, in your face,
Temple of a Thousand Steps.


373
00:33:00.505 --> 00:33:03.679
<i>Thousand Steps.</i>

374
00:33:03.884 --> 00:33:05.978
Yeah.

375
00:33:06.177 --> 00:33:10.603
Scooby
-Dooby-
- I'm pooped.

376
00:33:10.807 --> 00:33:12.400
We made it, gang.

377
00:33:12.601 --> 00:33:15.855
And check out that stone
carving above the temple door.


378
00:33:17.314 --> 00:33:19.567
The Green Dragon.

379
00:33:24.738 --> 00:33:27.332
Check out the
size of that disco ball.


380
00:33:27.532 --> 00:33:29.159
That's no disco ball, Shaggy.

381
00:33:29.367 --> 00:33:31.244
It's a Japanese lantern.

382
00:33:31.453 --> 00:33:35.083
Hey, maybe that's got something
to do with the next clue.


383
00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:40.421
Or maybe we should just say we
tried and, like, call it a day.


384
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:42.302
Zoinks!

385
00:33:53.433 --> 00:33:54.480
Jinkies.

386
00:33:54.684 --> 00:33:57.563
Shaggy, you did it.
I did?


387
00:33:57.771 --> 00:33:59.694
I mean, I did.

388
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:02.992
Like, what did I do, Scoob?

389
00:34:03.193 --> 00:34:04.866
I don't know.

390
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.789
it looks like some
kind of treasure map.


391
00:34:07.989 --> 00:34:10.458
Showing the whole island.

392
00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.536
Is that the Sword of Doom?

393
00:34:12.744 --> 00:34:15.964
Huh! Yes, it must be.

394
00:34:16.164 --> 00:34:18.542
But it's on the other
side of the island.


395
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:21.219
I will translate the inscription.

396
00:34:21.419 --> 00:34:26.801
"The secret falls
from the mouth of the dragon."


397
00:34:27.008 --> 00:34:28.555
Another dragon riddle?

398
00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.387
Uh, speaking of riddles...

399
00:34:30.595 --> 00:34:35.021
...like, does this mean
there's a cafeteria on this island?


400
00:34:41.606 --> 00:34:44.359
No. We must get out of here.

401
00:34:45.735 --> 00:34:47.487
Like, why?

402
00:34:49.364 --> 00:34:51.458
Hurry, before they catch us.

403
00:35:10.135 --> 00:35:11.978
Okay, everybody just stay calm...

404
00:35:12.178 --> 00:35:13.725
...and let me do all the talking.

405
00:35:15.807 --> 00:35:17.525
Hello there. Heh.

406
00:35:17.726 --> 00:35:20.104
We're from America.

407
00:35:23.064 --> 00:35:26.910
Like, how do we get ourselves
into these things?


408
00:35:29.279 --> 00:35:32.408
...Droo-ga-ga.

409
00:35:33.158 --> 00:35:36.879
Droo-ga-ga. Droo-ga-ga.

410
00:35:37.078 --> 00:35:38.546
"Droo-ga-ga"?

411
00:35:38.747 --> 00:35:41.717
It must be their name
for the Green Dragon.


412
00:35:41.917 --> 00:35:44.670
They are going to offer us
as a sacrifice.


413
00:35:47.088 --> 00:35:51.264
And I think we're going to be
married to that icky tribal chief.


414
00:35:56.097 --> 00:35:57.314
Ew.

415
00:35:57.515 --> 00:35:58.641
Not if I can help it.

416
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:00.978
Miyumi, if you can
reach my bag...


417
00:36:01.186 --> 00:36:03.814
...I've got a plan to
save all our skins.


418
00:36:04.022 --> 00:36:05.490
Okay.

419
00:36:21.206 --> 00:36:23.709
Boy, you guys really know
how to cook...


420
00:36:25.543 --> 00:36:28.296
...hmm, but there's something
still missing.


421
00:36:29.297 --> 00:36:30.719
Huh?

422
00:36:36.846 --> 00:36:39.895
Mmm.
Hey, now that's more like it.


423
00:36:40.392 --> 00:36:42.736
Here, taste.

424
00:36:48.525 --> 00:36:53.076
Well, what are you waiting for?
Come on in, the water's fine.


425
00:36:54.906 --> 00:36:57.250
Like, now we're cooking.
Right, Scoob?


426
00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.497
Yeah.

427
00:37:10.463 --> 00:37:13.842
I mean, mmm! Yummy.

428
00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:16.519
Okay, that should do it.

429
00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.974
Now, just cover and
simmer for one hour.


430
00:37:20.181 --> 00:37:21.854
Huh?

431
00:37:28.648 --> 00:37:29.740
Zoinks!

432
00:37:29.941 --> 00:37:33.195
Ha, ha. That's the problem
with gourmet cooking nowadays.


433
00:37:33.403 --> 00:37:36.202
Like, everyone's a critic.

434
00:37:40.577 --> 00:37:43.456
Huh! Droo-ga-ga!

435
00:37:54.257 --> 00:37:56.225
Huh! You did it, Velma.

436
00:37:56.426 --> 00:37:58.474
Lucky for us the plane's
robotic navigator...


437
00:37:58.678 --> 00:38:00.897
...is still connected
to my wireless interface.


438
00:38:01.097 --> 00:38:03.976
The villagers must think the
hover jet is the Green Dragon.


439
00:38:04.184 --> 00:38:06.437
So, like, what are we dragging
our feet for?


440
00:38:06.644 --> 00:38:07.896
Come on.

441
00:38:32.629 --> 00:38:35.508
Look, how magnificent.

442
00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.390
The secret falls
from the mouth of the dragon.


443
00:38:39.594 --> 00:38:43.349
The riddle is
pointing to the waterfall.


444
00:38:43.556 --> 00:38:45.979
So, like, what do we do next?

445
00:38:46.518 --> 00:38:48.896
We go in for a closer look.

446
00:38:49.104 --> 00:38:52.825
Like, I was afraid
you were gonna say that.


447
00:39:14.212 --> 00:39:16.556
- Weird.
- Check it out.


448
00:39:18.466 --> 00:39:19.513
Huh?

449
00:39:26.349 --> 00:39:27.396
Come on, Scoob.

450
00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:29.352
There's nothing to be afraid of.

451
00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:30.608
Yeah, see?

452
00:39:30.812 --> 00:39:33.110
Like, they're only statues.

453
00:39:33.314 --> 00:39:35.692
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Uh-uh!

454
00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:38.403
Would you come with us
for a Scooby Snack?


455
00:39:39.862 --> 00:39:41.614
Nope.

456
00:39:41.823 --> 00:39:44.622
Would you do it
for two Scooby Snacks?


457
00:39:44.826 --> 00:39:46.294
Uh-uh.

458
00:39:46.494 --> 00:39:48.292
How about 10 Scooby Snacks?

459
00:39:51.165 --> 00:39:53.338
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:39:55.003 --> 00:39:57.472
Scooby
-Dooby
-Doo!

461
00:40:02.719 --> 00:40:05.814
Wow, look at this place.

462
00:40:06.556 --> 00:40:09.150
We've found it at last.

463
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:13.105
The Sword of Doom.

464
00:40:16.649 --> 00:40:18.902
So, like, what are we waiting for?

465
00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:22.489
Let's grab the sword
and blow this pop stand.


466
00:40:22.697 --> 00:40:24.574
Uh-huh.

467
00:40:24.782 --> 00:40:26.284
I don't know, guys.

468
00:40:26.826 --> 00:40:30.000
Something doesn't feel right
about this.


469
00:40:30.205 --> 00:40:34.551
But Miss Mirimoto is expecting us
to bring the sword back to Japan.


470
00:40:36.002 --> 00:40:37.629
If you want to win...

471
00:40:37.837 --> 00:40:42.217
...you must be willing to do that
which others are not willing to do.


472
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:50.313
Zoinks! That did it.

473
00:40:57.273 --> 00:40:59.901
Run for it!

474
00:41:20.296 --> 00:41:22.549
Huh? Yikes!

475
00:41:25.468 --> 00:41:27.470
Foolish mortals.

476
00:41:28.012 --> 00:41:34.520
Return the sword to me
and I shall destroy you quickly.


477
00:41:34.727 --> 00:41:37.446
Return the sword
and be destroyed?


478
00:41:38.898 --> 00:41:41.572
Like, I'd hate to hear
option number two.


479
00:42:36.622 --> 00:42:38.044
- Hey!
- Oof!


480
00:42:38.875 --> 00:42:40.047
My glasses.

481
00:42:40.251 --> 00:42:43.221
Oh, I can't see a thing
without my glasses.


482
00:42:44.672 --> 00:42:47.926
That's funny, I can't see a
thing with your glasses.


483
00:42:53.806 --> 00:42:55.274
Zoinks!

484
00:42:59.979 --> 00:43:01.652
Run!

485
00:43:08.571 --> 00:43:10.039
Huh?

486
00:43:13.618 --> 00:43:15.040
ALL So

487
00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:22.752
It's all very simple.

488
00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.555
Sojo has been behind these
samurai shenanigans all along.


489
00:43:26.756 --> 00:43:29.635
He stole the Black Samurai's armor
from the museum.


490
00:43:29.842 --> 00:43:34.393
And he used this high-tech mini jetpack
to fly around like a real live ghost.


491
00:43:34.597 --> 00:43:36.725
Scooby
-Dooby
-Doo!

492
00:43:38.935 --> 00:43:42.109
Sojo's master plan was to bring the
legend of the Black Samurai to life...


493
00:43:42.313 --> 00:43:44.816
...and scare everyone away
from the tournament.


494
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.278
<i>That way he could steal
the Destiny Scroll...</i>


495
00:43:48.486 --> 00:43:51.956
<i>...then search for the
Sword of Doom on his own.</i>


496
00:43:54.534 --> 00:43:56.332
Once we set out
to solve the mystery...


497
00:43:56.536 --> 00:43:59.631
...his only hope was to steal
the sword from us.


498
00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:02.424
Like, talk about a
sneaky samurai.


499
00:44:02.625 --> 00:44:05.799
Yeah, sneaky.

500
00:44:06.003 --> 00:44:07.050
Yes.

501
00:44:07.255 --> 00:44:09.303
And he would have gotten away
with it too...


502
00:44:09.507 --> 00:44:11.930
...if it weren't for
you meddling kids.


503
00:44:12.134 --> 00:44:13.386
Sojo!

504
00:44:21.853 --> 00:44:23.446
Zoinks!
Yikes!


505
00:44:23.646 --> 00:44:26.570
Jeepers!
Jinkies!


506
00:44:27.483 --> 00:44:30.737
Dang, I still don't
have a catch phrase.


507
00:44:30.945 --> 00:44:32.538
We must protect the sword.

508
00:44:36.784 --> 00:44:38.661
Huh! They're robots.

509
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:40.213
Ninja robots!

510
00:44:40.413 --> 00:44:41.665
Double cool!

511
00:44:41.873 --> 00:44:44.422
Uh, sorry, I--
I geeked out there for a sec.


512
00:44:44.625 --> 00:44:47.344
So, like, the ninjas
were your own robots?


513
00:44:47.545 --> 00:44:50.014
Huh? I don't get it.

514
00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.519
The tournament was
just an excuse...


515
00:44:54.719 --> 00:44:59.316
...to gather the greatest martial
artists from around the world.


516
00:45:05.479 --> 00:45:07.026
<i>Using computer analysis...</i>

517
00:45:07.231 --> 00:45:11.202
<i>...their various fighting styles
were digitized...</i>


518
00:45:11.402 --> 00:45:13.951
<i>...into my ninja robots.</i>

519
00:45:15.281 --> 00:45:18.330
After that, all I needed
was to find someone...


520
00:45:18.534 --> 00:45:21.538
...who could solve
the riddle of the Destiny Scroll.


521
00:45:21.746 --> 00:45:25.796
And who better than the world's
greatest teenage detectives?


522
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.172
Come on, Miyumi.

523
00:45:27.376 --> 00:45:29.720
We can fight them together.

524
00:45:30.463 --> 00:45:31.885
Miyumi?

525
00:45:32.089 --> 00:45:35.059
Huh! You're one of them.

526
00:45:35.259 --> 00:45:39.355
I'm sorry, but I must remain
loyal to my sensei.


527
00:45:39.555 --> 00:45:41.774
Tomorrow night,
when the moon is full...


528
00:45:41.974 --> 00:45:45.854
...I will resurrect the Black
Samurai from the Sword of Doom.


529
00:45:46.062 --> 00:45:51.239
Once I have freed his spirit,
he will call me master.


530
00:45:51.901 --> 00:45:52.948
No.

531
00:45:53.152 --> 00:45:54.620
This is madness.

532
00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.868
Once the Black Samurai
has returned...


533
00:45:57.073 --> 00:45:59.667
...I will order him
to lead my robot ninjas...


534
00:45:59.867 --> 00:46:03.167
...against the ignorant forces
of this modern age.


535
00:46:03.371 --> 00:46:05.794
Then the ancient world
of the samurai...


536
00:46:05.998 --> 00:46:08.092
...and the new world
of technology...


537
00:46:08.292 --> 00:46:12.638
...shall exist in
perfect harmony.


538
00:46:12.838 --> 00:46:15.717
Oh.
Hmm, it could work.


539
00:46:15.925 --> 00:46:19.225
Miyumi, did you know about this?
No.


540
00:46:19.428 --> 00:46:21.772
My only instructions
were to earn your trust...


541
00:46:21.973 --> 00:46:24.146
...by becoming your friend.

542
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:27.103
The first rule of
Mirimoto Academy.


543
00:46:27.311 --> 00:46:28.938
If you want to win...

544
00:46:29.146 --> 00:46:34.198
...you must be willing to do that
which others are not willing to do.


545
00:46:34.402 --> 00:46:36.996
But if you do things
that a winner wouldn't do...


546
00:46:37.196 --> 00:46:39.665
...that automatically
makes you a loser.


547
00:46:39.866 --> 00:46:41.459
Hyah!

548
00:46:42.326 --> 00:46:43.794
Huh?

549
00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:45.997
Zoinks!
Uh-oh!


550
00:46:46.372 --> 00:46:47.715
Whoa!

551
00:46:54.672 --> 00:46:58.051
Like, all aboard
the Samurai Sword Express.


552
00:46:58.259 --> 00:47:00.387
Shaggy and Scooby
got away.


553
00:47:00.594 --> 00:47:04.690
But you will not be
so fortunate.


554
00:47:06.267 --> 00:47:08.565
Miyumi, Sojo, come.

555
00:47:08.769 --> 00:47:11.318
I hope you will enjoy
your new role...


556
00:47:11.522 --> 00:47:16.369
...as part of the museum's
permanent collection.


557
00:47:58.903 --> 00:48:00.280
Shaggy?

558
00:48:17.505 --> 00:48:18.973
Zoinks!

559
00:48:23.177 --> 00:48:25.771
Way to go, Scoob.
I think we lost them.


560
00:48:25.971 --> 00:48:27.644
Huh?

561
00:48:27.848 --> 00:48:31.648
Gulp! Speaking of losing,
like, we're losing altitude.


562
00:48:35.272 --> 00:48:37.195
- Ungh!
- Phew.


563
00:48:38.734 --> 00:48:40.202
Huh?

564
00:48:55.626 --> 00:48:59.256
Welcome to Green Dragon Sushi.
You sit.


565
00:48:59.463 --> 00:49:02.262
Eat sushi. Good for you, eh?

566
00:49:02.466 --> 00:49:05.561
Like, you got anything back there
without a head on it?


567
00:49:08.222 --> 00:49:10.441
Ew.

568
00:49:10.641 --> 00:49:13.440
You like miso soup?

569
00:49:13.644 --> 00:49:16.523
Misc soup?
Sounds perfect- Ha, ha.


570
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:18.528
Like, me so hungry.

571
00:49:18.733 --> 00:49:22.328
Yeah. Me so hungry too.

572
00:49:26.407 --> 00:49:29.627
Ah! Like, that
really hit the spot.


573
00:49:29.827 --> 00:49:31.670
Yum, yum.

574
00:49:33.706 --> 00:49:37.131
I am Matsuhiro.

575
00:49:37.334 --> 00:49:38.677
Menu?

576
00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.047
Hey, check it out, Scoob.

577
00:49:41.255 --> 00:49:44.850
Like, it's our old friend,
the Green Dragon.


578
00:49:45.051 --> 00:49:48.897
Ah! So you know the legend.

579
00:49:49.889 --> 00:49:51.436
You could say that.

580
00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.813
Do you know what I like most
about legends?


581
00:49:54.018 --> 00:49:57.522
New chapters are being written
all the time.


582
00:49:58.981 --> 00:50:00.983
You never know
what is going to happen next.


583
00:50:06.697 --> 00:50:07.949
- Zoinks!
- Yipes!


584
00:50:08.157 --> 00:50:12.287
Gulp! Like, Sword of Doom,
don't fail us now.


585
00:50:12.494 --> 00:50:15.589
Eh? The Sword of Doom?

586
00:50:15.789 --> 00:50:17.336
But how?

587
00:50:17.541 --> 00:50:18.838
Like, we'll tell you later.

588
00:50:19.043 --> 00:50:23.014
Right now, we've got a serious case
of the robot ninjas.


589
00:50:23.213 --> 00:50:25.056
Robot ninjas?

590
00:50:28.719 --> 00:50:30.562
Hyah!

591
00:50:30.763 --> 00:50:33.357
Now we will have some fun.

592
00:50:48.072 --> 00:50:51.622
No! The Sword of Doom.

593
00:50:56.872 --> 00:50:58.545
They are gone.

594
00:50:58.749 --> 00:51:01.047
Gee whiz, for a sushi chef...

595
00:51:01.251 --> 00:51:04.221
...you're no cold fish
with a samurai sword.


596
00:51:04.421 --> 00:51:09.803
That is because I am samurai.

597
00:51:17.226 --> 00:51:21.106
Give it up, Freddy.
Those doors must be 3 feet thick.


598
00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.533
We gotta get out of here somehow.

599
00:51:24.733 --> 00:51:27.486
I'll chop away all
night if I have to.


600
00:51:29.363 --> 00:51:31.957
We do not have all night.

601
00:51:33.575 --> 00:51:37.250
I should not have been so critical
of this modern age.


602
00:51:37.872 --> 00:51:40.421
If only I had one more chance...

603
00:51:40.624 --> 00:51:46.552
...I would fight to save this
world like a modern-day samurai.


604
00:51:48.007 --> 00:51:49.054
Huh?

605
00:52:00.603 --> 00:52:04.107
You've freed us, Kenji.
You're a hero.


606
00:52:06.108 --> 00:52:07.781
Takagawa san?

607
00:52:07.985 --> 00:52:10.238
Why did you lock yourself
in the vault?


608
00:52:10.446 --> 00:52:12.198
There is no time to explain.

609
00:52:13.657 --> 00:52:18.914
There will be more than one
samurai brought back to life.


610
00:52:22.625 --> 00:52:26.630
How could we let those rotten
robots take the Sword of Doom?


611
00:52:26.837 --> 00:52:28.305
What are we gonna do now?

612
00:52:29.757 --> 00:52:30.804
I don't know.

613
00:52:31.008 --> 00:52:32.976
Look there.

614
00:52:33.177 --> 00:52:36.226
The great mountain,
Fuji san.


615
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:42.233
Sacred training ground
for generations of samurai.


616
00:52:42.436 --> 00:52:43.688
Samurai?

617
00:52:43.896 --> 00:52:47.275
But, like, we don't know anything
about being samurai warriors.


618
00:52:47.483 --> 00:52:48.780
Mm-mm.

619
00:52:50.486 --> 00:52:51.908
Do not be afraid.

620
00:52:52.112 --> 00:52:55.366
A samurai must overcome his fear.

621
00:52:55.574 --> 00:52:57.076
When fear is gone...

622
00:52:57.284 --> 00:52:59.833
...the mind will be empty.

623
00:53:01.288 --> 00:53:03.165
Ha, ha. Like, an empty mind?

624
00:53:03.373 --> 00:53:05.751
Well, why didn't you just say so?
Ha-ha-ha.


625
00:53:05.959 --> 00:53:08.087
Now, that's something
I've got already.


626
00:53:08.295 --> 00:53:10.263
Uh-huh. Me too.

627
00:53:11.131 --> 00:53:12.883
The samurai never hesitates.

628
00:53:13.091 --> 00:53:15.719
He acts, he fights, he wins.

629
00:53:15.928 --> 00:53:19.478
Without fear, without anger,
without mind.


630
00:53:19.681 --> 00:53:21.604
And without lunch breaks.

631
00:53:21.809 --> 00:53:25.564
Like, I'm ready to trade in this
samurai sword for a shish kebab.


632
00:53:25.771 --> 00:53:28.775
Oh, shish kebab.

633
00:53:28.982 --> 00:53:31.076
Yum, yum.

634
00:53:37.116 --> 00:53:39.710
That's it, Scoob. We did it.

635
00:53:43.122 --> 00:53:44.749
Well done, tomodachi.

636
00:53:44.957 --> 00:53:46.800
You are ready to begin.

637
00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.219
Gulp! Begin?

638
00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:51.388
The last chapter has ended.

639
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:55.184
The next is yet to be written.

640
00:53:59.096 --> 00:54:01.565
These are the four gates:

641
00:54:02.099 --> 00:54:04.272
Earth, Air...

642
00:54:04.476 --> 00:54:06.774
...Fire and Water.

643
00:54:06.979 --> 00:54:09.823
Passing through each,
you will be purified.


644
00:54:10.023 --> 00:54:13.027
You have already found
the Gate of Earth.


645
00:54:13.235 --> 00:54:14.487
Huh?

646
00:54:14.695 --> 00:54:19.041
All you must do now
is pass through.


647
00:54:20.618 --> 00:54:22.586
Ha, ha.
Like, that was easy.


648
00:54:22.786 --> 00:54:24.629
The journey has begun.

649
00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:28.505
There can be no going back now.

650
00:54:28.709 --> 00:54:30.928
Okay.
Like, where to next?


651
00:54:31.128 --> 00:54:33.381
The legend tells of two swords...

652
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:37.935
...the Sword of Doom
and the Sword of Fate.


653
00:54:38.469 --> 00:54:43.225
Pass beyond the four gates
to the lair of the Green Dragon.


654
00:54:43.432 --> 00:54:46.185
Wake him from his
ancient slumber...


655
00:54:46.393 --> 00:54:49.397
...and seize the Sword of Fate.

656
00:54:49.605 --> 00:54:53.985
Gulp! Like, any chance you'd throw in a
couple of Scooby Snacks for the road?


657
00:54:55.569 --> 00:54:57.947
Like, Scoob, old buddy...

658
00:54:58.155 --> 00:55:01.625
...remind me again
how we got talked into this.


659
00:55:01.825 --> 00:55:05.420
I don't remember.

660
00:55:07.039 --> 00:55:08.882
There it is.

661
00:55:09.083 --> 00:55:10.801
That must be the Gate of Air.

662
00:55:12.252 --> 00:55:15.176
Like, last one there
is a rotten samurai.


663
00:55:19.676 --> 00:55:21.678
Ha, ha. We made it.

664
00:55:21.887 --> 00:55:23.355
Huh?

665
00:55:23.555 --> 00:55:24.602
Yipes!

666
00:55:24.807 --> 00:55:30.029
Gulp! Like, whatever you do,
Scoob, don't look down.


667
00:55:30.229 --> 00:55:31.697
Yikes!

668
00:55:41.824 --> 00:55:44.794
Phew! Like, that was a close one.

669
00:55:44.993 --> 00:55:46.040
SCOOBY
Huh?


670
00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:01.093
Like, check us out, Scoob.
We're hanging 10.


671
00:56:01.301 --> 00:56:04.896
Gulp! Ten thousand degrees
Fahrenheit, that is.


672
00:56:09.351 --> 00:56:12.321
There it is, Scoob.
The Gate of Fire.


673
00:56:21.446 --> 00:56:23.540
Whoa!

674
00:56:31.373 --> 00:56:33.046
The Gate of Water.

675
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:34.297
Water.

676
00:56:41.717 --> 00:56:42.764
- Huh?
- Ooh!


677
00:56:43.343 --> 00:56:44.811
We made it, Scoob.

678
00:56:45.011 --> 00:56:48.106
This must be the Green Dragon's
groovy grotto.


679
00:56:48.307 --> 00:56:52.938
Like, not bad for a mystical dragon
who probably doesn't even exist.


680
00:56:53.145 --> 00:56:58.276
Who dares enter my sacred grove?

681
00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:02.996
Be ye samurai?

682
00:57:03.905 --> 00:57:07.079
You bet. Like,
I'm Shogun Shaggy...


683
00:57:07.284 --> 00:57:11.414
...and this is my faithful
companion, Samurai Scooby-Doo.


684
00:57:11.622 --> 00:57:13.340
Gulp! Hello.

685
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:17.761
O Great Green One,
we come bearing rotten news.


686
00:57:17.961 --> 00:57:22.967
The Sword of Doom is back and the
Black Samurai is on the attack.


687
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:28.768
Impossible.

688
00:57:30.682 --> 00:57:34.562
Ages ago, the Sword of
Doom was hidden away...


689
00:57:34.770 --> 00:57:40.277
...protected by guardians of stone,
high atop a secret mountain...


690
00:57:40.484 --> 00:57:46.537
...on a savage island surrounded
by an impenetrable fog.


691
00:57:50.702 --> 00:57:52.875
Yeah, funny story about that.

692
00:57:56.667 --> 00:58:00.638
But, like, that's all ancient history.
Tonight, the modern world is in danger...


693
00:58:00.837 --> 00:58:02.680
...and we need your help.

694
00:58:03.298 --> 00:58:06.848
There is no place left
in the world for dragons.


695
00:58:09.971 --> 00:58:11.018
What are you?

696
00:58:11.223 --> 00:58:15.729
A big green dragon
afraid of a little sword fight?


697
00:58:20.315 --> 00:58:24.161
You don't look like samurai.

698
00:58:28.407 --> 00:58:30.330
Tell him, Shaggy.
Gulp!


699
00:58:30.534 --> 00:58:31.911
Like, the truth is--

700
00:58:40.043 --> 00:58:42.637
That's better.

701
00:58:43.046 --> 00:58:44.172
Like, wow. Ha, ha.

702
00:58:44.381 --> 00:58:48.557
Check it out, Scoob. We're rolling
old-school, samurai-style.


703
00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.388
Yeah, old-school.

704
00:58:53.139 --> 00:58:56.734
For centuries, I have guarded
the Sword of Fate...


705
00:58:56.935 --> 00:59:00.360
...awaiting the day when its
service would again be needed.


706
00:59:00.564 --> 00:59:03.989
That day has finally come.

707
00:59:09.364 --> 00:59:14.461
The legend must end
where it all began.


708
00:59:14.661 --> 00:59:18.006
Like, up, up and away we go.

709
00:59:18.206 --> 00:59:20.300
Whee!

710
00:59:31.094 --> 00:59:32.437
Sojo, come.

711
00:59:32.637 --> 00:59:34.139
It is time.

712
00:59:44.983 --> 00:59:49.989
The Destiny Scroll
still holds one last secret.


713
00:59:52.782 --> 00:59:54.876
"Standing on the bridge
of his defeat...


714
00:59:55.077 --> 00:59:58.377
...hold the Sword of Doom
to the rising full moon.


715
00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:00.708
The spell will be broken...

716
01:00:00.916 --> 01:00:03.419
...and the spirit of
the Black Samurai...


717
01:00:03.627 --> 01:00:07.006
...shall be set free."

718
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:11.014
Sojo, walk to the bridge.

719
01:00:11.218 --> 01:00:14.438
Sojo walk to bridge.

720
01:00:17.599 --> 01:00:20.648
Miyumi, do not fail
me this night.


721
01:00:20.852 --> 01:00:25.073
Your loyalty shall be rewarded
in the coming new world.


722
01:00:25.274 --> 01:00:27.572
Yes, sensei.

723
01:00:33.907 --> 01:00:35.454
Okay, gang, get ready.

724
01:00:35.992 --> 01:00:38.962
I can't believe Miyumi's
really going through with this.


725
01:00:39.162 --> 01:00:42.883
Ohh! With friends like her,
who needs enemies?


726
01:00:46.628 --> 01:00:49.723
Miyumi, sword.

727
01:00:49.923 --> 01:00:51.766
Huh? Huh?

728
01:00:55.429 --> 01:00:57.978
The treacherous little fool.
Ugh!


729
01:00:58.181 --> 01:01:00.855
Yahoo! Way to go, Miyumi.

730
01:01:01.059 --> 01:01:02.902
I knew you were one of us.

731
01:01:05.522 --> 01:01:08.071
Oops!
Now, Velma.


732
01:01:08.608 --> 01:01:09.780
Hit it, Kenji.

733
01:01:19.494 --> 01:01:21.292
Magnetic pulse away.

734
01:01:28.336 --> 01:01:32.261
The magnetic pulse is knocking
out their electrical systems.


735
01:01:34.509 --> 01:01:36.227
It Worked.

736
01:01:56.364 --> 01:01:59.789
Hmm. Maybe it worked
a little too well.


737
01:02:03.747 --> 01:02:05.294
Ungrateful child.

738
01:02:05.499 --> 01:02:10.630
I was blinded by my loyalty to you,
but now I can see clearly.


739
01:02:10.837 --> 01:02:14.011
How dare you disobey me?

740
01:02:22.599 --> 01:02:24.021
Huh! The sword!

741
01:02:27.479 --> 01:02:29.356
<i>Bansai!</i>

742
01:02:58.551 --> 01:03:04.058
The Black Samurai lives again.

743
01:03:07.978 --> 01:03:09.230
No, samurai.

744
01:03:09.437 --> 01:03:11.189
I am the master here.

745
01:03:11.398 --> 01:03:13.275
Bow before me...

746
01:03:13.483 --> 01:03:16.453
...and I will give you the world.

747
01:03:19.698 --> 01:03:21.826
Foolish one.

748
01:03:25.787 --> 01:03:30.543
It is you who shall
call me master.


749
01:03:33.628 --> 01:03:34.880
MOANS]

750
01:03:35.088 --> 01:03:39.264
Bow before me, mortals.

751
01:03:40.969 --> 01:03:43.063
- Unh!
- Unh! Whoa!


752
01:03:45.265 --> 01:03:47.688
- Unh!
- Unh! Whoa!


753
01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:54.983
All shall serve me...

754
01:03:55.191 --> 01:03:57.944
...forever!

755
01:04:02.198 --> 01:04:04.200
Shaggy, look.

756
01:04:09.664 --> 01:04:14.670
At last, freedom is mine.

757
01:04:14.878 --> 01:04:17.097
Oh, no. Like, we're too late.

758
01:04:17.297 --> 01:04:18.344
Fear not.

759
01:04:18.548 --> 01:04:21.677
Shogun Shaggy, 
Samurai Scooby...

760
01:04:21.885 --> 01:04:24.434
...you must carry on the fight.

761
01:04:24.637 --> 01:04:26.981
Unsheathe the Sword of Fate...

762
01:04:27.182 --> 01:04:31.062
...so that my spirit
may enter the blade.


763
01:04:31.269 --> 01:04:34.022
I shall be with you always...

764
01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:39.282
...guiding the sword from within.

765
01:04:50.246 --> 01:04:51.714
Guys, look.

766
01:04:51.915 --> 01:04:53.758
Huh! It's Shaggy and Scooby.

767
01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:55.460
Ow! My neck.

768
01:04:56.878 --> 01:04:59.973
Like, right on time,
late as usual.


769
01:05:11.309 --> 01:05:16.065
Who dares challenge
the Black Samurai?


770
01:05:16.272 --> 01:05:18.400
Zoinks!
Like, here we go, Scoob.


771
01:05:18.608 --> 01:05:21.327
Remember what they taught us
in samurai school.


772
01:05:21.528 --> 01:05:24.407
Uh... Uh, I forgot.

773
01:05:33.456 --> 01:05:35.208
Huh?

774
01:05:35.959 --> 01:05:38.712
The Sword of Fate?

775
01:05:39.462 --> 01:05:41.089
Impossible.

776
01:05:41.297 --> 01:05:43.049
Like, you think
that's impossible...


777
01:05:43.258 --> 01:05:46.728
...try flying into Tokyo
on a green dragon sometime.


778
01:06:33.558 --> 01:06:34.935
Hyah!

779
01:06:48.406 --> 01:06:51.205
Fools. You are no match for me.

780
01:06:53.912 --> 01:06:55.664
- Aah!
- Yipes!


781
01:06:58.791 --> 01:07:02.216
A samurai must overcome his fear.

782
01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:07.802
When fear is gone,
the mind will be empty.


783
01:07:08.009 --> 01:07:09.886
Like, did you hear that, Scoob?

784
01:07:10.094 --> 01:07:12.347
Yeah, I did.

785
01:07:12.555 --> 01:07:15.024
It's that sushi sword master,
Matsuhiro.


786
01:07:15.224 --> 01:07:16.396
He's in my head.

787
01:07:16.601 --> 01:07:18.695
No, I'm not. I'm over here.

788
01:07:18.895 --> 01:07:22.024
The samurai acts without anger.

789
01:07:22.231 --> 01:07:24.905
He fights without mind.

790
01:07:29.781 --> 01:07:30.828
Yikes!

791
01:07:31.032 --> 01:07:33.000
Don't think, Scoob.
Just let it go.


792
01:07:33.201 --> 01:07:35.203
Like, no mind.

793
01:07:35.411 --> 01:07:37.539
Oh, yeah.

794
01:07:38.915 --> 01:07:44.422
The Sword of Doom
shall be your destroyer.


795
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:55.977
Hyah!

796
01:07:59.769 --> 01:08:04.024
No!

797
01:08:17.495 --> 01:08:21.170
Ha, ha. Like, that psychotic
samurai forgot one thing.


798
01:08:21.374 --> 01:08:24.628
When it comes to no mind,
we've got everybody beat.


799
01:08:24.836 --> 01:08:26.759
Like, our minds are
always empty.


800
01:08:26.963 --> 01:08:28.590
Yeah.

801
01:08:30.425 --> 01:08:33.850
Scooby, Shaggy,
that was amazing.


802
01:08:38.057 --> 01:08:39.149
Huh?

803
01:08:45.773 --> 01:08:48.572
Like, it's just a little old man.

804
01:08:48.776 --> 01:08:50.119
Thank you...

805
01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:53.915
...most honored friends.

806
01:08:54.115 --> 01:08:56.163
You have released my spirit...

807
01:08:56.367 --> 01:09:00.747
...from the evil power
of that cursed sword...


808
01:09:00.955 --> 01:09:03.799
...and saved your world.

809
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.927
I shall be eternally grateful.

810
01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:12.930
You are indeed samurai...

811
01:09:13.134 --> 01:09:16.638
...and your legend
shall be told...


812
01:09:17.346 --> 01:09:20.065
...forever.

813
01:09:23.478 --> 01:09:24.525
Wow.

814
01:09:24.729 --> 01:09:26.106
He disappeared.

815
01:09:26.314 --> 01:09:28.112
Well, you gotta hand it to him.

816
01:09:28.316 --> 01:09:31.115
He went out in real
samurai-style.


817
01:09:33.404 --> 01:09:34.747
Congratulations...

818
01:09:35.448 --> 01:09:37.917
...samurai.

819
01:09:38.659 --> 01:09:43.085
The last chapter of the legend
has finally been written...


820
01:09:43.289 --> 01:09:45.963
"by you.

821
01:09:48.127 --> 01:09:49.549
<i>Welcome to...</i>

822
01:09:49.754 --> 01:09:51.848
<i>...the new Tokyo Museum
of Cultural History...</i>


823
01:09:52.048 --> 01:09:55.769
<i>...and the grand opening
of our most legendary exhibit...</i>


824
01:09:55.969 --> 01:10:00.315
<i>...the ghost of the
Black Samurai.</i>


825
01:10:00.932 --> 01:10:04.311
And so, it is with
great honor that I present...


826
01:10:04.519 --> 01:10:09.946
...for loyal service to his friends,
to Japan and to all the world...


827
01:10:10.149 --> 01:10:12.618
...this statue...

828
01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:16.956
...in honor of Scooby
-Doo.

829
01:10:22.078 --> 01:10:25.127
Droo-ga-ga. Droo-ga-ga.

830
01:10:28.668 --> 01:10:31.717
Scoob, you really did get
your own statue.


831
01:10:31.921 --> 01:10:34.549
Ha, ha. And, like,
they even got your good side.


832
01:10:34.757 --> 01:10:35.974
Yeah.

833
01:10:37.427 --> 01:10:40.226
Ha, ha. Congratulations, Scooby.

834
01:10:41.014 --> 01:10:44.814
Now Japan will
remember you forever.


835
01:10:45.018 --> 01:10:47.487
Are you sure you won't come
with us, Miyumi?


836
01:10:47.687 --> 01:10:50.236
There's bound to be other
mysteries that need solving.


837
01:10:50.439 --> 01:10:53.067
And there's always room for one
more in the Mystery Machine.


838
01:10:53.276 --> 01:10:55.950
Yeah, like, you could sit
in the back with me and Scooby.


839
01:10:56.154 --> 01:10:58.202
Yeah, sit with me.

840
01:10:58.698 --> 01:11:00.325
You're all very sweet...

841
01:11:00.533 --> 01:11:02.661
...but solving mysteries
is what you do best.


842
01:11:02.869 --> 01:11:05.998
Now I need to figure out
what it is that I do best.


843
01:11:06.206 --> 01:11:07.423
Then maybe someday...

844
01:11:07.623 --> 01:11:10.297
...I will have what it takes
to become a legend too.


845
01:11:10.501 --> 01:11:12.299
Just like you, Scooby.

846
01:11:14.297 --> 01:11:15.844
Aw...

847
01:11:23.639 --> 01:11:25.687
Heh, heh. Oh, brother.

848
01:11:25.892 --> 01:11:27.064
This could take a while.

849
01:11:28.519 --> 01:11:31.773
We may just have to leave Scooby
here and take the statue home.


850
01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:41.621
Scooby
-Dooby
-Doo!
