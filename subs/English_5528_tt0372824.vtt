1
00:00:29.315 --> 00:00:30.316
Yes?

2
00:00:30.984 --> 00:00:34.320
Pierre, there's
an urgent call from France.


3
00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.991
After the concert.

4
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:43.997
It's about your mother.

5
00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:54.007
Yes?

6
00:02:53.543 --> 00:02:55.962
Do you remember me?

7
00:02:57.213 --> 00:02:59.007
Fond de I'étang.

8
00:02:59.132 --> 00:03:01.593
"My father is coming for me
on Saturday."


9
00:03:03.344 --> 00:03:05.763
Pépinot.

10
00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:07.640
Of course.

11
00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:10.018
Pépinot.

12
00:03:11.102 --> 00:03:14.314
- How long has it been?
- About 50 years.


13
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.902
Fond de I'étang.

14
00:03:22.196 --> 00:03:25.366
You're the little guy in the front row.

15
00:03:25.408 --> 00:03:27.577
And there you are.

16
00:03:27.702 --> 00:03:30.371
Do you remember the prefect's name?

17
00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:32.415
Clément Mathieu.

18
00:03:32.498 --> 00:03:34.042
Clément Mathieu.

19
00:03:36.044 --> 00:03:38.588
I wonder what happened to him.

20
00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:42.508
Open it.

21
00:03:47.305 --> 00:03:48.848
"Fond de I'étang.

22
00:03:48.932 --> 00:03:50.683
1949."

23
00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:54.646
Mathieu kept a journal
while he worked at Fond de I'étang.


24
00:03:54.687 --> 00:03:57.815
That's his story. Ours too.

25
00:03:59.108 --> 00:04:01.152
He wanted you to have it.

26
00:04:01.236 --> 00:04:05.406
I'd have preferred to deliver it
under different circumstances, but...


27
00:04:09.327 --> 00:04:11.704
"January 15, 1949.

28
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.334
After failing for so long
in so many fields,


29
00:04:16.417 --> 00:04:19.629
I was sure the
worst was still to come."

30
00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:25.218
It was a boarding school where
troubled children were rehabilitated.


31
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.596
That's what the advertisement said.

32
00:04:28.638 --> 00:04:30.723
Fond de I'étang.

33
00:04:30.807 --> 00:04:34.102
Even the name seemed
to fit me like a glove.


34
00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:36.437
Hello.

35
00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:39.899
You're all alone?

36
00:04:40.525 --> 00:04:42.318
What are you doing there?

37
00:04:43.403 --> 00:04:45.655
Waiting for Saturday.

38
00:04:45.697 --> 00:04:47.073
Why?

39
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:50.952
My father is coming for me.

40
00:04:51.035 --> 00:04:53.162
But it's not Saturday.

41
00:04:53.246 --> 00:04:54.205
Pépinot.

42
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.708
Pépinot.

43
00:04:57.709 --> 00:05:01.296
Hello. I'm Clément Mathieu,
the new prefect.


44
00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.341
Have you done this type of work before?

45
00:05:05.425 --> 00:05:07.427
I taught some classes in private school.

46
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.512
- What did you teach?
- Music.


47
00:05:09.596 --> 00:05:14.142
You'll like Rachin, our headmaster.
He used to play the trumpet.


48
00:05:14.225 --> 00:05:15.810
- Hello, Pépinot.
- Hello.


49
00:05:15.893 --> 00:05:18.354
His daughters. 
He lives right there.

50
00:05:20.815 --> 00:05:23.818
- You haven't met Mr. Rachin?
- Not yet, no.


51
00:05:23.902 --> 00:05:26.571
- Mrs. Boissemand recommended me.
- Really?


52
00:05:26.654 --> 00:05:28.781
That was old Maxence.

53
00:05:28.865 --> 00:05:32.243
He told me on the spot
that he was the school watchman,


54
00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:35.830
as well as its nurse,
storekeeper and glazier.


55
00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:41.961
- What is he doing?
- Serving detention for Mr. Rachin.


56
00:05:42.545 --> 00:05:45.757
Fifteen days of community work.
In other words, school drudge.


57
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.468
What kind of children are they, exactly?

58
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:50.762
- No one told you?
- No.


59
00:05:52.597 --> 00:05:55.308
My infirmary. I'll show you
my vegetable garden later.


60
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.935
I'd like that.

61
00:05:59.771 --> 00:06:02.523
- Damn it! What have they done now?
- I'll help you.


62
00:06:02.607 --> 00:06:04.609
Are you Clément Mathieu?

63
00:06:04.651 --> 00:06:06.486
The headmaster...

64
00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.239
Rachin, the school's headmaster.

65
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.491
Headmaster, I'm sorry...

66
00:06:11.532 --> 00:06:14.160
- Yes, you're late.
- I had the wrong bus schedule.


67
00:06:14.244 --> 00:06:16.162
Punctuality is essential here.

68
00:06:16.246 --> 00:06:17.956
Very well.

69
00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:18.998
Headmaster.

70
00:06:20.124 --> 00:06:21.584
Very well, Headmaster.

71
00:06:21.626 --> 00:06:23.378
Come with me.

72
00:06:24.045 --> 00:06:27.298
First you should study
the school regulations,


73
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.468
then you can supervise
the 4:00 study period before you...


74
00:06:33.763 --> 00:06:36.266
What are you doing? Answer me.

75
00:06:36.307 --> 00:06:38.184
- Take this.
- It's my eye.


76
00:06:38.268 --> 00:06:41.437
Another trap. You can appreciate
our boarders' finer instincts.


77
00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:43.606
Get him over there.

78
00:06:43.648 --> 00:06:45.400
I'm blinded.

79
00:06:45.483 --> 00:06:48.403
Don't make a fuss. Show me.

80
00:06:48.486 --> 00:06:50.613
It's not pretty.

81
00:06:50.655 --> 00:06:52.907
Ring the bell. 
School assembly.

82
00:06:52.991 --> 00:06:55.868
- We should call a doctor.
- Do you know how much they charge?


83
00:06:55.952 --> 00:06:58.413
What did I say? 
Ring the assembly.

84
00:06:58.454 --> 00:06:59.831
The bell?

85
00:06:59.914 --> 00:07:02.375
Next to the door,
right in front of you.


86
00:07:02.417 --> 00:07:03.418
All right.

87
00:07:06.588 --> 00:07:08.131
Assembly.

88
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:11.134
Assembly.

89
00:07:12.468 --> 00:07:15.430
- Are they always like that?
- Keep ringing the bell.


90
00:07:25.106 --> 00:07:26.941
Two abreast.

91
00:07:30.945 --> 00:07:33.573
Everybody in the schoolyard.
Assembly.


92
00:07:37.243 --> 00:07:38.745
Hurry up.

93
00:07:39.537 --> 00:07:41.748
Move faster. Be silent.

94
00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:44.792
- Chrome Dome.
- Be silent.


95
00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:48.421
- Chrome Dome.
- Be silent.


96
00:07:50.465 --> 00:07:51.591
Be silent.

97
00:07:51.674 --> 00:07:53.676
- I didn't say anything.
- Be silent.


98
00:08:00.683 --> 00:08:02.852
I called this assembly

99
00:08:02.894 --> 00:08:06.648
because of a despicable attempt
against old Maxence.


100
00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:10.902
Under our action-reaction rule,
the culprit will be severely punished.


101
00:08:12.528 --> 00:08:15.657
I want the culprit's name
within the next three seconds,


102
00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:18.952
or it's six hours of lock-up
for each one of you.


103
00:08:19.035 --> 00:08:23.706
Effective until he's betrayed
or gives himself up.


104
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.250
Is that clear?

105
00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:27.043
One...

106
00:08:27.126 --> 00:08:28.586
Two...

107
00:08:28.711 --> 00:08:30.421
Three.

108
00:08:30.505 --> 00:08:32.006
No volunteers?

109
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.509
Of course. Come closer.

110
00:08:36.427 --> 00:08:38.304
- Mathieu.
- Me?


111
00:08:38.346 --> 00:08:40.306
Come closer.

112
00:08:40.348 --> 00:08:42.392
The school register, Mr. Chabert.

113
00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:43.977
Thank you.

114
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.522
Mr. Mathieu, your new prefect,
has been spared your acquaintance.


115
00:08:47.605 --> 00:08:50.191
- Chrome Dome.
- Be silent.


116
00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:53.778
So he can choose
who goes first without bias.


117
00:08:57.907 --> 00:08:59.075
Be silent.

118
00:08:59.158 --> 00:09:01.286
Pick a name.

119
00:09:01.369 --> 00:09:03.079
At random?

120
00:09:05.248 --> 00:09:07.917
- A word of advice...
- Don't interfere. Go on.


121
00:09:11.546 --> 00:09:12.839
Boniface.

122
00:09:14.966 --> 00:09:17.093
Too bad. Chabert, get Boniface.

123
00:09:19.762 --> 00:09:22.265
- Sir, I didn't do anything.
- Shut up.


124
00:09:22.307 --> 00:09:25.184
- It's lousy, I didn't do anything.
- Watch your language.


125
00:09:25.268 --> 00:09:26.686
Move.

126
00:09:26.728 --> 00:09:29.063
- I won't go.
- I'll kick your backside for you.


127
00:09:29.147 --> 00:09:31.149
Be silent.

128
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:33.693
Furthermore,
until I've found the culprit,


129
00:09:33.776 --> 00:09:36.905
there will be no recess
and no visitors.


130
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:39.490
I advise you to give him up quickly.

131
00:09:39.574 --> 00:09:41.910
It's an encouragement to turn informer.

132
00:09:42.785 --> 00:09:45.747
You're full of noble illusions
like any new staff member.


133
00:09:45.788 --> 00:09:47.832
Come see me in eight days.

134
00:09:47.916 --> 00:09:51.210
You'll be replacing Mr. Régent.
He'll explain your duties.


135
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.550
Clean sheets.

136
00:09:57.634 --> 00:09:58.968
Thank you.

137
00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:03.181
Why are you leaving?

138
00:10:04.766 --> 00:10:07.060
Ten stitches.

139
00:10:07.143 --> 00:10:09.562
Cut with scissors.

140
00:10:09.646 --> 00:10:12.523
Just for confiscating
Mouton's cigarettes.


141
00:10:12.607 --> 00:10:15.401
- Mouton?
- The boy's name is Mouton.


142
00:10:17.487 --> 00:10:19.614
And Mouton's still here?

143
00:10:22.408 --> 00:10:25.453
By the way, Le Querrec
booby-trapped Maxence's door.


144
00:10:25.495 --> 00:10:28.498
I heard him talking about it
in the corridor.


145
00:10:28.581 --> 00:10:31.501
- And you didn't say anything?
- I didn't want to miss the bus.


146
00:10:32.502 --> 00:10:35.213
Old Maxence punished him
for breaking some glass panes.


147
00:10:35.296 --> 00:10:37.590
Simple revenge. 
That's just his style.

148
00:10:38.591 --> 00:10:39.926
Le Querrec.

149
00:10:41.427 --> 00:10:43.846
Don't forget that name: Le Querrec.

150
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.431
- Morhange too.
- Yes.


151
00:10:45.515 --> 00:10:48.518
Morhange doesn't talk much,
but keep an eye on him.


152
00:10:48.601 --> 00:10:51.604
Looks like an angel,
acts like the devil.


153
00:10:51.688 --> 00:10:53.731
Action-reaction.

154
00:10:53.815 --> 00:10:55.817
That's all they understand.

155
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.322
They're all yours.

156
00:11:03.074 --> 00:11:05.243
- Good luck.
- Thank you.


157
00:11:13.167 --> 00:11:14.877
Our benefactresses.

158
00:11:15.003 --> 00:11:16.921
The timetable's over there.

159
00:11:17.046 --> 00:11:19.507
Classes were shared
between the headmaster,


160
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:21.593
who taught French and History,

161
00:11:21.676 --> 00:11:25.305
and Mr. Langlois,
who taught every other subject.


162
00:11:25.388 --> 00:11:27.640
Mr. Langlois, here's the new prefect.

163
00:11:27.724 --> 00:11:29.517
Clément Mathieu.

164
00:11:29.601 --> 00:11:33.271
- A prefect at your age?
- Yes, but I used to teach.


165
00:11:33.396 --> 00:11:35.732
Very well then.

166
00:11:39.777 --> 00:11:42.196
And he's the funny one.

167
00:11:42.238 --> 00:11:46.242
Take your study period. You're late.
No need to show you the way.


168
00:12:09.682 --> 00:12:11.601
Watch out. Chrome Dome's coming.

169
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:21.819
Gentlemen.

170
00:12:26.908 --> 00:12:28.868
No smoking during class.

171
00:12:30.328 --> 00:12:33.039
The rules apply to everyone.
Even you, sir.


172
00:12:37.126 --> 00:12:39.754
Give it back.

173
00:12:39.837 --> 00:12:41.297
Be quiet.

174
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:42.966
Give it back.

175
00:12:43.925 --> 00:12:46.094
Be silent.

176
00:12:46.135 --> 00:12:47.637
Give it back.

177
00:12:51.057 --> 00:12:54.143
An auspicious beginning.
Congratulations, Mathieu.


178
00:12:54.227 --> 00:12:55.812
Sit.

179
00:12:58.565 --> 00:12:59.857
Of course.

180
00:12:59.899 --> 00:13:02.735
You again.

181
00:13:02.819 --> 00:13:06.072
What did he do?

182
00:13:06.197 --> 00:13:07.657
Nothing, Headmaster.

183
00:13:08.741 --> 00:13:12.078
What do you mean, "nothing?"
You were about to punish him.


184
00:13:12.161 --> 00:13:14.664
I asked him to go to the blackboard

185
00:13:14.747 --> 00:13:17.083
and I was just telling them
to be silent.


186
00:13:17.166 --> 00:13:19.919
Not a minute too soon.

187
00:13:20.878 --> 00:13:22.880
Don't make me come back.

188
00:13:29.262 --> 00:13:31.806
Stand in the corner.

189
00:13:33.016 --> 00:13:34.976
Very well.

190
00:13:35.018 --> 00:13:40.064
Now that you've come to know me,
we need to set things straight.


191
00:13:40.148 --> 00:13:43.234
Right now,
one of your classmates is in lock-up.


192
00:13:43.318 --> 00:13:45.278
For no good reason.

193
00:13:45.361 --> 00:13:48.656
I may not look like much
but I'm no fool.


194
00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:50.700
I know who did it.

195
00:13:50.783 --> 00:13:53.870
He has 15 seconds to give himself up.

196
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.917
I'm waiting.

197
00:14:00.668 --> 00:14:03.630
You'll regret it. 
Five seconds left.

198
00:14:05.632 --> 00:14:07.842
Too late.

199
00:14:08.718 --> 00:14:10.178
Le Querrec.

200
00:14:11.262 --> 00:14:12.805
Who is Le Querrec?

201
00:14:13.765 --> 00:14:15.934
I am, sir.

202
00:14:17.143 --> 00:14:18.937
What a surprise.

203
00:14:19.437 --> 00:14:22.857
- You hurt Mr. Maxence.
- No, sir. I didn't do it.


204
00:14:22.941 --> 00:14:25.652
- That wasn't a question.
- I didn't do anything.


205
00:14:25.693 --> 00:14:28.863
Between the two of us, I wonder
who the headmaster will believe.


206
00:14:28.947 --> 00:14:34.327
I need someone dependable
to keep an eye on things while I'm gone.


207
00:14:34.369 --> 00:14:38.456
According to my sixth sense,
that dependable student must be...


208
00:14:38.539 --> 00:14:40.333
...Mr. Morhange.

209
00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.380
Come on, come on.
Who is Mr. Morhange?


210
00:14:46.506 --> 00:14:48.299
That's me, sir.

211
00:14:55.431 --> 00:14:58.226
So you're the angel.

212
00:14:59.227 --> 00:15:03.147
Go down. You'll supervise
the class while I'm gone.


213
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:04.983
Go on.

214
00:15:05.066 --> 00:15:09.487
Nice. You could pull out
your shirt a bit more.


215
00:15:09.571 --> 00:15:13.825
I'm told the rebellious have
strong leadership skills. Prove it.


216
00:15:14.826 --> 00:15:17.579
Come to the headmaster's office.

217
00:15:19.956 --> 00:15:22.417
- Have mercy, sir.
- Mercy?


218
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:26.212
What about the boy who's taken
your place? And old Maxence?


219
00:15:26.254 --> 00:15:28.756
I didn't want to hurt him.
It was just a joke.


220
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.508
A joke?

221
00:15:30.592 --> 00:15:35.638
...a little stint in lock-up.
I've had enough of you.


222
00:15:35.722 --> 00:15:39.225
But first, I'm going to give you
the flogging of your life.


223
00:15:42.312 --> 00:15:44.397
- Who is it?
- Leclerc.


224
00:15:44.439 --> 00:15:48.943
He's tried to run away three times.
He's taking him to lock-up.


225
00:15:48.985 --> 00:15:51.279
- So you won't be alone.
- Don't.


226
00:15:54.657 --> 00:15:58.286
Maybe we can come to an agreement.

227
00:15:58.369 --> 00:16:00.872
You hurt Mr. Maxence. Badly.

228
00:16:00.955 --> 00:16:04.417
I won't take you to the headmaster
but I have to punish you.


229
00:16:05.501 --> 00:16:10.340
Instead of fooling around during recess,
you'll work in the infirmary.


230
00:16:10.381 --> 00:16:12.926
You'll be old Maxence's nurse.

231
00:16:12.967 --> 00:16:15.678
You'll look after him until he's cured.

232
00:16:15.762 --> 00:16:17.221
All right?

233
00:16:36.032 --> 00:16:37.909
Not bad.

234
00:16:37.992 --> 00:16:39.786
What do you think?

235
00:16:39.869 --> 00:16:43.373
But I can do better. Give me the chalk.
Stand in profile.


236
00:16:43.498 --> 00:16:45.166
Profile.

237
00:16:58.972 --> 00:17:01.516
Let's see a smile for a change.

238
00:17:01.599 --> 00:17:04.519
You can look now.

239
00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:08.064
I almost forgot...
Some color would be nice.


240
00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:14.112
Much better. Get back to your seat.

241
00:17:15.822 --> 00:17:17.740
Very well.

242
00:17:17.824 --> 00:17:22.495
I want to get to know you,
so you're going to write your name,


243
00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:26.207
your age and your dream job
on a piece of paper.


244
00:17:32.505 --> 00:17:36.301
I was astonished when
they all did as they were told.


245
00:17:40.471 --> 00:17:43.391
All except one.

246
00:17:47.228 --> 00:17:49.230
You're not writing?

247
00:17:51.774 --> 00:17:54.777
How long have you been here?

248
00:17:54.819 --> 00:17:57.363
A long time?

249
00:17:57.405 --> 00:17:59.532
I don't know.

250
00:18:01.326 --> 00:18:03.411
Write, little fellow.

251
00:18:19.385 --> 00:18:22.013
An exhausting first day.

252
00:18:22.055 --> 00:18:25.308
I forgot why I came here
in the first place.


253
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:29.646
Rachin scares me, the building
scares me, even the children scare me.


254
00:18:29.687 --> 00:18:34.067
I keep expecting them
to slip into my recess and murder me.


255
00:18:34.108 --> 00:18:35.610
My blanket.

256
00:18:36.861 --> 00:18:39.322
- Got a cigarette?
- Shut up.


257
00:18:39.405 --> 00:18:40.907
Go to bed.

258
00:18:56.464 --> 00:18:59.801
I read the assignments again.

259
00:18:59.884 --> 00:19:02.387
They all had fabulous dreams.

260
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:05.848
Two firemen, three cowboys,
one tiger tamer, one fighter pilot,


261
00:19:05.932 --> 00:19:10.728
two spies, a general under Napoleon,
one balloonist, three legionaries...


262
00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:14.190
Not one school prefect.

263
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.070
It was nice of you
to volunteer to be my nurse.


264
00:19:19.153 --> 00:19:24.534
Doctor, the new prefect asked
for a volunteer to take care of me.


265
00:19:24.576 --> 00:19:27.537
And he raised his hand right away.

266
00:19:27.579 --> 00:19:30.123
Proof that
we should believe in miracles.


267
00:19:30.164 --> 00:19:32.166
Come in.

268
00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:34.961
Mr. Mathieu, the new prefect.

269
00:19:36.838 --> 00:19:38.047
So?

270
00:19:38.131 --> 00:19:41.259
It's pretty bad, Maxence.

271
00:19:41.342 --> 00:19:44.345
If they've started attacking you,
they're beyond help.


272
00:19:44.429 --> 00:19:47.473
You're so patient with them.

273
00:19:47.557 --> 00:19:51.227
I've got a thick skull.
You shouldn't be feeling sorry for me.


274
00:19:51.311 --> 00:19:54.939
I feel sorry for those poor kids.
Don't forget one of them is dead.


275
00:19:55.023 --> 00:19:56.441
Dead?

276
00:19:56.524 --> 00:19:59.277
His name was Mouton.
He jumped off the roof.


277
00:19:59.402 --> 00:20:01.613
Good thing he was an orphan.

278
00:20:01.696 --> 00:20:04.866
Look at him. Everyone says
he's a lost cause. It's not true.


279
00:20:04.949 --> 00:20:08.411
He's a good boy.
You just have to know him.


280
00:20:08.494 --> 00:20:10.663
Old Maxence is a nice guy.

281
00:20:12.248 --> 00:20:15.960
I'm talking to you, Le Querrec.
Don't you think he's nice?


282
00:20:17.295 --> 00:20:19.297
No?

283
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.381
Yes.

284
00:20:20.465 --> 00:20:22.967
- I didn't hear you.
- Leave him alone. He's shy.


285
00:20:23.051 --> 00:20:24.761
Like me.

286
00:20:26.387 --> 00:20:28.598
One, two, three, four...

287
00:20:31.059 --> 00:20:33.019
Faster.

288
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:36.606
Yes?

289
00:20:36.689 --> 00:20:39.317
- I'd like a word, Headmaster.
- Leaving us so soon?


290
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.862
- No, I'd like to try something.
- You don't say.


291
00:20:42.946 --> 00:20:46.074
About the accident.

292
00:20:46.157 --> 00:20:48.534
- That was no accident.
- Quite.


293
00:20:48.576 --> 00:20:50.620
I need three things from you.

294
00:20:50.703 --> 00:20:53.831
- Is that all?
- One, cancel the group punishment,


295
00:20:53.915 --> 00:20:59.921
two, let me deal with the culprit,
and three, don't ask me for his name.


296
00:21:00.046 --> 00:21:02.257
You'd have to know it first.

297
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.800
Naturally.

298
00:21:03.883 --> 00:21:08.054
Your arrogance astounds me.
Do you really think you'll find him?


299
00:21:08.137 --> 00:21:12.058
Very well. If you succeed,
I'll cancel the group punishment.


300
00:21:12.141 --> 00:21:15.728
But you'll never get the culprit
or I'm the biggest fool in nature.


301
00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.233
I know who did it, Headmaster.

302
00:21:21.526 --> 00:21:23.736
Congratulations.

303
00:21:23.778 --> 00:21:26.322
Who is it?

304
00:21:26.406 --> 00:21:28.658
You said I wouldn't have to tell you.

305
00:21:30.076 --> 00:21:32.912
Fine. Very well then.

306
00:21:32.954 --> 00:21:35.039
But I don't like your manners.

307
00:21:35.123 --> 00:21:38.001
You'd better make sure
your students behave.


308
00:21:38.042 --> 00:21:41.713
- I've already got them under control.
- That's what you think.


309
00:21:41.754 --> 00:21:44.549
One, two, three, four... Go on.

310
00:21:45.758 --> 00:21:47.010
Faster.

311
00:22:01.065 --> 00:22:04.903
- There's no pictures of naked women.
- I never said there were naked women.


312
00:22:04.944 --> 00:22:06.946
What does yours say?

313
00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.825
"Ave Maria for soprano
by Clément Mathieu."


314
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:14.495
I've got, "String quartet...

315
00:22:14.537 --> 00:22:17.707
...by Clément Mathieu."
- Looks like music.


316
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.293
- What do you know about it?
- Maybe it's Morse.


317
00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:22.837
- Or some secret code.
- Maybe he's no prefect.


318
00:22:22.879 --> 00:22:25.340
Maybe he's an undercover spy.

319
00:22:25.423 --> 00:22:26.716
Chrome Dome.

320
00:22:37.518 --> 00:22:39.479
Give it back to me.

321
00:22:39.604 --> 00:22:42.190
- What is it, sir?
- None of your business.


322
00:22:42.273 --> 00:22:45.193
Is there a problem, Mathieu?

323
00:22:45.276 --> 00:22:47.445
No problem.

324
00:22:47.487 --> 00:22:49.489
It's just music.

325
00:22:49.572 --> 00:22:51.282
What for?

326
00:22:52.242 --> 00:22:53.701
A chorus.

327
00:22:54.744 --> 00:22:56.746
In the water closets?

328
00:22:58.331 --> 00:23:00.792
Clear out, chorus.

329
00:23:06.339 --> 00:23:08.925
- Not here, Mathieu.
- What?


330
00:23:09.008 --> 00:23:11.719
- Don't play the idiot.
- You're not suggesting...?


331
00:23:11.761 --> 00:23:13.846
I won't say anything this time.

332
00:23:14.931 --> 00:23:18.351
- You really see evil everywhere.
- In here? Yes.


333
00:23:25.775 --> 00:23:28.194
Baldy, you are through

334
00:23:28.236 --> 00:23:31.072
The rules won't be made by you

335
00:23:31.155 --> 00:23:33.658
Baldy, you are through

336
00:23:33.741 --> 00:23:36.119
The rules won't be made by you

337
00:23:52.427 --> 00:23:54.596
The rules won't be made by you

338
00:23:54.679 --> 00:23:57.015
Chickening out, guys?

339
00:23:58.892 --> 00:24:01.936
- You're Corbin.
- Yes, sir, but I didn't do anything.


340
00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.147
- You were singing.
- No, sir. I swear.


341
00:24:04.272 --> 00:24:08.318
You were singing. Badly.
And you couldn't even tell.


342
00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:09.861
Go on. Sing.

343
00:24:09.903 --> 00:24:12.488
I'm listening.

344
00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.950
Would you prefer to sing
for the headmaster? Go on.


345
00:24:16.034 --> 00:24:18.536
Chrome Dome
Prepare to meet your doom


346
00:24:19.621 --> 00:24:21.664
Chrome Dome
Prepare to meet your doom


347
00:24:21.706 --> 00:24:24.042
You're not the boss of us

348
00:24:24.125 --> 00:24:26.544
You're not the boss of us

349
00:24:26.586 --> 00:24:28.963
No one ever told you
you couldn't sing?


350
00:24:29.047 --> 00:24:32.300
Sir? Is that really music
in your satchel?


351
00:24:32.383 --> 00:24:34.469
Mind your own business.

352
00:24:36.179 --> 00:24:40.350
By the way, if I ever catch
one of you messing with my things...


353
00:24:41.893 --> 00:24:44.187
...he'll be very sorry.

354
00:24:44.229 --> 00:24:46.981
Now be quiet.
Time to go to bed. Hurry up.


355
00:24:47.065 --> 00:24:48.566
It's over.

356
00:25:03.665 --> 00:25:05.667
Go to sleep.

357
00:25:24.102 --> 00:25:27.188
I couldn't get their ditty
out of my head.


358
00:25:27.272 --> 00:25:30.608
They're not very good at it,
but they are singing.


359
00:25:30.692 --> 00:25:33.570
I even spotted a few good voices.

360
00:25:34.737 --> 00:25:38.324
Are those kids really a lost cause?

361
00:25:38.408 --> 00:25:41.452
And I had sworn never
to touch my music again.


362
00:25:43.204 --> 00:25:45.081
Never say never.

363
00:25:46.082 --> 00:25:48.960
Nothing is ever truly lost.

364
00:25:57.385 --> 00:25:59.178
January 23rd.

365
00:25:59.262 --> 00:26:03.349
One week after his accident, old Maxence
suddenly took a turn for the worse.


366
00:26:03.433 --> 00:26:06.144
The doctor sent him to the hospital.

367
00:26:11.316 --> 00:26:13.860
Is he going to die?

368
00:26:14.861 --> 00:26:17.196
No, we'll save him.

369
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:22.035
The very same day,
Pépinot got into trouble.


370
00:26:22.076 --> 00:26:25.121
Mr. Pépinot, you're a dunce.

371
00:26:25.204 --> 00:26:30.043
Final question. The last one.
How did Marshal Ney die?


372
00:26:38.968 --> 00:26:40.720
I'm waiting.

373
00:26:51.439 --> 00:26:52.732
Hunting?

374
00:26:54.776 --> 00:26:55.735
Zero.

375
00:26:55.818 --> 00:26:59.322
One hundred lines by tomorrow:
"Marshal Ney was shot."


376
00:27:00.323 --> 00:27:01.866
Get out.

377
00:27:10.208 --> 00:27:12.502
Boniface. Come here, boy.

378
00:27:16.089 --> 00:27:18.758
Here, as a reward for your essay.

379
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.177
Give it to Mrs. Marie
and you'll get a cookie.


380
00:27:21.261 --> 00:27:24.264
You knew Ney had been shot, eh?

381
00:27:24.347 --> 00:27:26.391
Of course, sir. 
Just like Napoleon.

382
00:27:28.351 --> 00:27:29.769
Get out.

383
00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.565
Hold on, Mr. Morhange.

384
00:27:33.648 --> 00:27:35.692
I saw you taking notes during class.

385
00:27:35.733 --> 00:27:40.572
This is a rare occurrence indeed.
Bring me your notebook.


386
00:27:57.088 --> 00:27:58.214
Charming.

387
00:28:02.677 --> 00:28:06.014
Read it.
Admire the spelling.


388
00:28:11.895 --> 00:28:15.356
"Mr. Rachin eats shit by the bushel."

389
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.025
He wrote "Mr.?"

390
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:19.485
No.

391
00:28:19.569 --> 00:28:22.530
Action-reaction, Mr. Mathieu.

392
00:28:22.614 --> 00:28:24.073
Lock-up.

393
00:28:29.787 --> 00:28:31.247
Come on.

394
00:28:53.144 --> 00:28:56.522
- Gentlemen, enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.


395
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:59.734
Are you hungry, Pépinot?

396
00:29:05.365 --> 00:29:07.617
Now you can eat.

397
00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.118
Pépinot?

398
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.578
He's an orphan.

399
00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.747
His parents died
during the Occupation.


400
00:29:13.790 --> 00:29:15.875
- How did they die?
- I don't know.


401
00:29:15.917 --> 00:29:19.045
The kid thinks his father
will come for him on a Saturday.


402
00:29:20.964 --> 00:29:23.049
No one ever comes on Saturday.

403
00:29:23.132 --> 00:29:26.177
So we tell him he'll come
next Saturday, and so on.


404
00:29:26.261 --> 00:29:28.346
It'd be easier to tell him the truth.

405
00:29:28.388 --> 00:29:31.599
We must have told him 100 times.
He won't listen.


406
00:29:31.683 --> 00:29:36.521
Now we let him wait by the gate.
Let him enjoy himself.


407
00:29:38.064 --> 00:29:39.774
Be quiet!

408
00:29:41.442 --> 00:29:44.487
Did you see that? 
Action-reaction.

409
00:29:44.571 --> 00:29:46.114
Meaning?

410
00:29:46.197 --> 00:29:47.699
Action.

411
00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.367
Reaction.

412
00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.120
There's a visitor for young Morhange.

413
00:29:52.203 --> 00:29:54.080
Morhange is in lock-up.

414
00:29:54.205 --> 00:29:56.666
No visitors for the punished.
You know the rules.


415
00:29:56.749 --> 00:29:59.711
Go tell his visitor then.

416
00:30:25.153 --> 00:30:26.988
Good day, madame.

417
00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:28.531
Good day.

418
00:30:28.573 --> 00:30:30.700
I'm the new prefect.

419
00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:33.411
I'm Pierre Morhange's mother.

420
00:30:33.494 --> 00:30:35.455
Clément Mathieu.

421
00:30:35.496 --> 00:30:39.584
I know this isn't the right day,
but it's the only time I could...


422
00:30:39.667 --> 00:30:43.087
- No, that's not the problem.
- Has he been punished again?


423
00:30:43.212 --> 00:30:45.715
No, nothing like that...

424
00:30:45.798 --> 00:30:48.176
...but he's not here.

425
00:30:48.259 --> 00:30:50.386
What do you mean?

426
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:53.848
They took him to the dentist.
He had a toothache.


427
00:30:53.932 --> 00:30:55.558
A toothache?

428
00:30:55.642 --> 00:30:59.354
Yes, but nothing serious.
He'll be back tonight.


429
00:31:00.521 --> 00:31:03.816
I can't wait.
I'm going back to work at 5.


430
00:31:04.859 --> 00:31:06.861
Can I leave something for him?

431
00:31:06.945 --> 00:31:08.988
Of course.

432
00:31:12.283 --> 00:31:16.162
Her name is Violette.
Violette Morhange.


433
00:31:16.204 --> 00:31:19.207
A single mother at her wits' end
about her son,


434
00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:24.462
a thieving introvert expelled from
school because he kept running away.


435
00:31:24.504 --> 00:31:28.675
When Pierre was sent to Fond de
I'étang against his mother's wishes,


436
00:31:28.758 --> 00:31:33.680
she told the judge, "At least
he'll get a hot meal twice a day."


437
00:31:35.932 --> 00:31:38.309
January 30th. The experience begins.

438
00:31:38.601 --> 00:31:41.688
In Brittany, the hats are...

439
00:31:42.188 --> 00:31:45.567
In Brittany, the hats are round

440
00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:48.945
That's why I'm Brittany bound

441
00:31:48.987 --> 00:31:52.115
Soprano. Go left.

442
00:31:52.156 --> 00:31:53.866
Leclerc.

443
00:31:56.244 --> 00:32:01.040
He is born, the Holy Child
Let us greet His coming


444
00:32:01.124 --> 00:32:03.585
Almost in tune.
Alto, go left.


445
00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.004
Delaire.

446
00:32:08.339 --> 00:32:11.843
Three miles on foot
What does it use?


447
00:32:11.968 --> 00:32:14.679
Three miles on foot
eats up your shoes


448
00:32:14.762 --> 00:32:16.264
Do it again.

449
00:32:16.347 --> 00:32:19.475
Four miles on foot
What does it use?


450
00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:22.020
Four miles on foot
eats up your shoes


451
00:32:22.145 --> 00:32:25.523
I was right. Bass, go right.

452
00:32:25.565 --> 00:32:27.066
Ricoeur.

453
00:32:29.569 --> 00:32:33.531
I've got tobacco in my pouch

454
00:32:33.573 --> 00:32:35.575
I'll give it away, not today

455
00:32:35.658 --> 00:32:38.661
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
Alto, left.


456
00:32:39.662 --> 00:32:41.247
Illouz.

457
00:32:44.459 --> 00:32:47.378
Love is a gypsy child

458
00:32:47.462 --> 00:32:50.423
That obeys no one's laws

459
00:32:50.465 --> 00:32:53.843
Soprano, of course. Left.

460
00:32:53.927 --> 00:32:56.137
Very well. Pépinot.

461
00:32:59.974 --> 00:33:01.935
I don't know any songs.

462
00:33:02.018 --> 00:33:04.354
That's fine. I'll teach you some.

463
00:33:05.813 --> 00:33:10.068
In the meantime,
you can be Assistant Chorus Master.


464
00:33:12.403 --> 00:33:13.696
Over there.

465
00:33:16.699 --> 00:33:19.410
Boniface.

466
00:33:21.204 --> 00:33:24.374
Marshal Pétain, here we are

467
00:33:24.457 --> 00:33:27.835
- Who taught you that?
- My grandfather.


468
00:33:27.877 --> 00:33:30.296
A little old-fashioned. Left.

469
00:33:31.214 --> 00:33:32.382
Clément.

470
00:33:34.842 --> 00:33:38.471
Citizens to arms
Display your charms


471
00:33:38.555 --> 00:33:40.014
Enough. Right.

472
00:33:40.056 --> 00:33:42.183
My camp counselor's a jerk

473
00:33:42.225 --> 00:33:45.061
He doesn't do any work

474
00:33:45.103 --> 00:33:46.187
Go left.

475
00:33:46.229 --> 00:33:49.357
Cuckoo, booboo
Cuckoo, booboo


476
00:33:52.735 --> 00:33:54.153
Good. Alto.

477
00:34:05.123 --> 00:34:07.250
Strong beat.

478
00:34:07.333 --> 00:34:09.085
Strong beat.

479
00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:24.559
Show me, Corbin.

480
00:34:32.066 --> 00:34:35.153
Sorry, there's no such note.
Come here.


481
00:34:36.237 --> 00:34:38.656
Mr. Pépinot, hand me the score.

482
00:34:39.157 --> 00:34:41.993
Thank you. Open your hands.

483
00:34:42.076 --> 00:34:44.662
Hold them like this.

484
00:34:44.746 --> 00:34:46.706
Good. You can be our lectern.

485
00:34:48.708 --> 00:34:50.418
Baton, Mr. Pépinot.

486
00:34:51.461 --> 00:34:53.129
Thank you.

487
00:34:55.173 --> 00:34:57.091
Get ready. On three...

488
00:35:04.766 --> 00:35:05.725
Again.

489
00:35:09.979 --> 00:35:11.522
That's it.

490
00:35:11.606 --> 00:35:13.316
One, two, three, four.

491
00:35:13.399 --> 00:35:16.527
Le Querrec's on bread and water...

492
00:35:16.653 --> 00:35:19.864
Every night, I make them practice
a simple tune of my own.


493
00:35:19.948 --> 00:35:23.076
Carpentier has lost his way

494
00:35:23.117 --> 00:35:26.955
Fond de I'Etang is where
we're stuck, just our luck


495
00:35:26.996 --> 00:35:30.750
Fond de I'Etang is where we'll be
for all eternity


496
00:35:39.592 --> 00:35:41.469
Not bad.

497
00:35:41.511 --> 00:35:44.514
It wasn't Mozart,
but I had their attention now.


498
00:35:44.597 --> 00:35:48.351
From now on, I would need
the support of my superiors.


499
00:35:48.393 --> 00:35:50.895
What?

500
00:35:50.979 --> 00:35:52.897
A chorus?

501
00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:54.190
Yes.

502
00:35:54.315 --> 00:35:58.236
My poor man, you've completely lost it.

503
00:35:58.278 --> 00:36:02.073
A chorus. You won't get a single note
from them or I'm the biggest fool...


504
00:36:02.115 --> 00:36:04.784
Please, Headmaster,
don't finish your sentence.


505
00:36:04.826 --> 00:36:06.578
Why not?

506
00:36:06.661 --> 00:36:08.538
They're singing already.

507
00:36:08.663 --> 00:36:10.123
Really?

508
00:36:10.164 --> 00:36:11.624
Just a few notes.

509
00:36:11.708 --> 00:36:15.295
Why ask my permission
if you're already doing it?


510
00:36:15.378 --> 00:36:17.380
I don't like your manners.

511
00:36:17.463 --> 00:36:20.091
- Headmaster...
- You're annoying me.


512
00:36:20.174 --> 00:36:22.302
I have other things on my mind.

513
00:36:22.385 --> 00:36:25.722
Very well. I enjoy a good laugh.

514
00:36:25.763 --> 00:36:27.724
Make them sing.

515
00:36:27.765 --> 00:36:31.144
But if everything goes sour,
you'll lose your job.


516
00:36:34.564 --> 00:36:37.191
Thank you for your support, Headmaster.

517
00:36:42.071 --> 00:36:43.740
February 8th.

518
00:36:43.823 --> 00:36:47.285
As we begin rehearsals,
Rachin starts on Morhange.


519
00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:50.121
As soon as he's out of lock-up,
he lowers the axe:


520
00:36:50.204 --> 00:36:52.248
one month of community work.

521
00:36:52.332 --> 00:36:54.667
From the beginning. Get ready.

522
00:37:16.773 --> 00:37:19.234
Hey, skivvy. Don't forget my bed.

523
00:37:55.019 --> 00:37:56.563
February 15th.

524
00:37:56.646 --> 00:37:59.440
We're visited by Dr. Dervaux,
a psychiatrist.


525
00:37:59.482 --> 00:38:01.734
He brought us a gift.

526
00:38:01.776 --> 00:38:06.239
We've decided to take this boy
out of St. Féréol Reformatory


527
00:38:06.281 --> 00:38:11.703
to study his capacity to adapt
to a... more liberal environment.


528
00:38:11.786 --> 00:38:14.455
Unlike most of his classmates,

529
00:38:14.539 --> 00:38:16.749
Pascal Mondain has begun
to read and write.


530
00:38:16.833 --> 00:38:20.128
At any rate, he can speak
more or less normally.


531
00:38:20.253 --> 00:38:23.298
We assessed his potential
with the Binet-Simon Test.


532
00:38:23.381 --> 00:38:25.383
The Binet
-Simon.

533
00:38:25.425 --> 00:38:28.428
We also administered
the Rorschach and Drüss Fables.


534
00:38:28.511 --> 00:38:30.930
- Excellent.
- As you know, this test...


535
00:38:31.014 --> 00:38:33.975
That test sorted children
into seven different categories:


536
00:38:34.058 --> 00:38:35.435
normal, adequate,

537
00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.980
borderline, mildly,
moderately or severely retarded.


538
00:38:39.063 --> 00:38:41.107
And finally, imbeciles.

539
00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:45.820
Mondain scored
within the borderline zone.


540
00:38:45.904 --> 00:38:49.115
He isn't actually mad,
but I should warn you...


541
00:38:50.199 --> 00:38:53.745
According to his profile,
he's a gregarious pervert.


542
00:38:56.039 --> 00:38:57.749
Interesting.

543
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.250
And what does that mean?

544
00:39:00.335 --> 00:39:02.503
Well...

545
00:39:02.545 --> 00:39:05.423
- Doctor?
- A tendency to be cruel, parasitic,


546
00:39:05.465 --> 00:39:09.802
destructive and above all...
Above all, a mythomaniac.


547
00:39:09.844 --> 00:39:13.097
- There you go.
- The place is full of them.


548
00:39:13.181 --> 00:39:16.351
Here the children face
non-specialized methods of discipline.


549
00:39:16.434 --> 00:39:19.145
Mondain's integration will provide
a good case study.


550
00:39:20.855 --> 00:39:22.774
Happy to oblige.

551
00:39:22.857 --> 00:39:25.777
We'll try to meet
your scientific requirements.


552
00:39:25.818 --> 00:39:28.029
Gentleman, this fellow is in your hands.

553
00:39:28.112 --> 00:39:30.281
- Will you stay for lunch?
- Gladly.


554
00:39:30.365 --> 00:39:32.325
Take good care of him.

555
00:39:32.408 --> 00:39:34.369
Action-reaction.

556
00:39:44.003 --> 00:39:46.047
You're not allowed to smoke.

557
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:50.802
For the experience to succeed,
I had to get the upper hand.


558
00:39:56.182 --> 00:39:58.685
You really look like an idiot.

559
00:39:59.727 --> 00:40:02.480
You'd better behave
or you'll get what's coming to you.


560
00:40:03.773 --> 00:40:05.149
All right.

561
00:40:10.655 --> 00:40:12.198
What's coming?

562
00:40:17.787 --> 00:40:19.831
You probably know a song, right?

563
00:40:21.207 --> 00:40:23.167
Yeah, but...

564
00:40:23.251 --> 00:40:24.752
But?

565
00:40:24.836 --> 00:40:26.838
You won't like it.

566
00:40:28.047 --> 00:40:31.175
Why don't you try me? Come here.

567
00:40:31.259 --> 00:40:32.218
Come on.

568
00:40:38.182 --> 00:40:39.684
I'm listening.

569
00:40:41.019 --> 00:40:43.563
One summer day
I took out my knob


570
00:40:43.605 --> 00:40:46.024
To give myself a nice hand job

571
00:40:46.107 --> 00:40:47.901
- All right.
- Up yours I go


572
00:40:47.984 --> 00:40:49.235
All right.

573
00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:53.031
Told you so.

574
00:40:53.072 --> 00:40:54.574
Not bad.

575
00:40:54.657 --> 00:40:57.410
You'll need to practice,
but you have a good baritone.


576
00:40:57.493 --> 00:40:58.578
What?

577
00:40:58.661 --> 00:41:01.080
Baritone. It's not an insult.

578
00:41:01.122 --> 00:41:03.750
When you sing,
your voice is low-pitched.


579
00:41:03.791 --> 00:41:06.252
Go to the back with the basses.

580
00:41:08.504 --> 00:41:11.549
- Fuck.
- And forget about the fucking.


581
00:41:11.674 --> 00:41:13.509
Next one to laugh gets punched out.

582
00:41:13.551 --> 00:41:16.095
Whenever you're ready, Mondain.

583
00:41:18.723 --> 00:41:21.142
He's allowed back in class.

584
00:41:21.184 --> 00:41:24.145
And here's Pépinot.
You forgot him by the gate.


585
00:41:25.438 --> 00:41:27.607
What's wrong, Pépinot?
It's not Saturday.


586
00:41:29.359 --> 00:41:31.110
By the way,

587
00:41:31.194 --> 00:41:34.113
when you write to your family...

588
00:41:34.197 --> 00:41:35.990
I don't have any.

589
00:41:36.032 --> 00:41:38.284
Well, for those who do,

590
00:41:38.368 --> 00:41:42.288
remind them that visits are on the
first and third Thursday of the month.


591
00:41:42.372 --> 00:41:44.457
Morhange, you're not paying attention.

592
00:41:44.499 --> 00:41:47.794
- What did I just say?
- I don't know.


593
00:41:47.835 --> 00:41:51.339
I said, you could write your mother
telling her that she can see you


594
00:41:51.422 --> 00:41:54.884
on the first or third Thursday
of the month. Or even both days.


595
00:41:54.968 --> 00:41:58.304
Understood? But the punished
can't have visitors, so be careful.


596
00:41:58.388 --> 00:42:00.306
I don't want to see the old goats.

597
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:02.267
Maybe Morhange
wants to see his mother.


598
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:04.561
Maybe he's not the only one.

599
00:42:07.105 --> 00:42:09.899
See, Morhange?
We have a real chorus.


600
00:42:09.983 --> 00:42:12.485
- I don't care.
- Why don't you care?


601
00:42:12.569 --> 00:42:15.446
Let's hear your voice.
Sing for me. Do...


602
00:42:16.614 --> 00:42:18.157
Go ahead.

603
00:42:18.199 --> 00:42:21.077
You want to go back?
Your range, quickly.


604
00:42:26.666 --> 00:42:29.752
Coarseness doesn't suit you, kid.

605
00:42:29.794 --> 00:42:32.505
We can't all be like Mondain.

606
00:42:32.547 --> 00:42:34.757
All right.
From the top.


607
00:42:36.801 --> 00:42:39.137
- Where are you going?
- I need to pee.


608
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:40.722
Mondain, wait.

609
00:42:41.973 --> 00:42:44.350
- Corbin.
- Can I go pee too, sir?


610
00:42:45.894 --> 00:42:47.896
Fine, everyone out.

611
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:01.868
And be quiet. Quiet.

612
00:43:23.431 --> 00:43:25.767
You have a nice voice, beautiful.

613
00:43:28.186 --> 00:43:30.146
Want a drag?

614
00:43:30.813 --> 00:43:33.024
They left you all alone?

615
00:43:33.107 --> 00:43:35.026
I'll protect you.

616
00:43:36.861 --> 00:43:38.571
Wait for me.

617
00:43:38.613 --> 00:43:40.323
We're the same.

618
00:43:40.406 --> 00:43:42.992
My parents are a couple of buggers.

619
00:43:44.035 --> 00:43:46.496
Your mother's the same.

620
00:43:46.579 --> 00:43:48.957
She got rid of
you to have some fun.

621
00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.500
No, she's working.

622
00:43:50.583 --> 00:43:53.920
- So the others are telling the truth?
- What?


623
00:43:55.004 --> 00:43:57.006
They say she's a whore.

624
00:44:00.009 --> 00:44:01.386
I'll rearrange your face.

625
00:44:01.469 --> 00:44:03.137
Get out.

626
00:44:05.598 --> 00:44:07.600
You're a dead man.

627
00:44:07.684 --> 00:44:09.185
Really?

628
00:44:20.488 --> 00:44:23.741
That day, Morhange
missed the 3:00 roll call.


629
00:45:02.655 --> 00:45:06.326
No one ever knew where he went,
but he'd come back.


630
00:45:06.409 --> 00:45:08.703
That was the important part.

631
00:45:11.289 --> 00:45:13.625
What are you doing there?

632
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:20.798
I can't go up.

633
00:45:20.882 --> 00:45:24.177
What do you mean,
you can't go up?


634
00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.263
Why not?

635
00:45:27.347 --> 00:45:29.015
I have no money.

636
00:45:29.098 --> 00:45:31.809
You need money to sleep?
That doesn't make sense.


637
00:45:33.353 --> 00:45:35.021
It's Mondain.

638
00:45:35.104 --> 00:45:39.025
He won't let me come up
unless I give him money.


639
00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.366
We have to be careful.

640
00:45:49.619 --> 00:45:51.996
At my last place,
the prefect caught me.


641
00:45:52.038 --> 00:45:55.333
- So I had to take care of him.
- How?


642
00:45:55.375 --> 00:45:58.878
With a bayonet. 
He bled like a pig.

643
00:45:58.962 --> 00:46:01.422
- You killed him?
- Kind of, yeah.


644
00:46:01.506 --> 00:46:04.759
It's no different here.
Chrome Dome had better watch out.


645
00:46:04.842 --> 00:46:07.178
- Mathieu isn't so bad.
- Yeah, right.


646
00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.723
They sing you a lullaby and when
you're asleep, they start pawing you.


647
00:46:10.807 --> 00:46:13.059
We've got to kill their kind.

648
00:46:15.353 --> 00:46:17.230
Good evening, gentlemen.

649
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:24.112
- Enjoy your meal.
- Sir, I swear I didn't do anything.


650
00:46:24.195 --> 00:46:26.906
You keep good company, Corbin.

651
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:30.702
Get out.

652
00:46:38.418 --> 00:46:40.461
Forget about the feast.

653
00:46:40.545 --> 00:46:43.089
I won't tell on you. A gift.

654
00:46:43.214 --> 00:46:47.135
But I'm warning you:
don't speak to Pépinot again.


655
00:46:47.218 --> 00:46:50.972
Don't go near him.
Don't even look at him.


656
00:46:51.055 --> 00:46:53.224
Do you understand?

657
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:58.730
One look in his direction, and
your life will turn into a nightmare.


658
00:47:05.194 --> 00:47:07.614
See on your way

659
00:47:07.739 --> 00:47:11.159
Forgotten kids who've strayed

660
00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.244
Give them a helping hand

661
00:47:13.328 --> 00:47:18.541
Lead them to new horizons
Help them understand


662
00:47:18.583 --> 00:47:23.046
Feel, in the depths of despair

663
00:47:24.547 --> 00:47:27.175
A surging wave of hope

664
00:47:27.258 --> 00:47:30.929
The fervor of life

665
00:47:31.012 --> 00:47:33.556
The glorious path

666
00:47:35.975 --> 00:47:38.436
What are you doing, Morhange?

667
00:47:38.519 --> 00:47:40.230
Nothing, sir.

668
00:47:40.355 --> 00:47:43.733
So I heard voices?
I must be tired.


669
00:47:45.693 --> 00:47:47.820
Section 8 of the interior rules:

670
00:47:47.904 --> 00:47:51.199
Students will not enter
a classroom without supervision.


671
00:47:51.282 --> 00:47:54.244
Mr. Rachin would make you do

672
00:47:54.327 --> 00:47:56.996
And who knows
what he'd tell your mother.


673
00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:59.415
I don't give a damn about my mother.

674
00:47:59.499 --> 00:48:01.542
- Why? Tell me.
- I'll tell you nothing.


675
00:48:01.626 --> 00:48:04.295
Wait. I'm not through.
That's a little too easy.


676
00:48:04.379 --> 00:48:07.340
You pay for everything here.
Ask Pépinot.


677
00:48:08.341 --> 00:48:12.011
Morhange, strangely enough,
the things you do don't resemble you.


678
00:48:12.053 --> 00:48:15.056
Running away, fighting,
pretending to be a hoodlum.


679
00:48:15.139 --> 00:48:18.977
Your classmates may laugh,
but I won't. I'm not playing along.


680
00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:23.398
Starting tomorrow, you will attend
every chorus practice


681
00:48:23.481 --> 00:48:26.734
and take a music lesson every day.
Go to bed now.


682
00:48:27.902 --> 00:48:29.320
Go on.

683
00:48:30.989 --> 00:48:32.574
March 3rd.

684
00:48:32.657 --> 00:48:36.369
He can't possibly know, but I do.
His voice is a miracle.


685
00:48:36.494 --> 00:48:38.955
The rare promise of an exceptional gift.

686
00:48:39.038 --> 00:48:40.999
Please go out quietly.

687
00:48:44.377 --> 00:48:46.129
I said quietly.

688
00:48:46.671 --> 00:48:49.924
Gradually, as my chorus takes shape,

689
00:48:50.008 --> 00:48:52.468
I bring my new singer
out of his shell.


690
00:49:09.736 --> 00:49:12.322
Childish delights

691
00:49:12.405 --> 00:49:15.366
Too soon forgotten and erased

692
00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:18.369
A golden light that burns forever

693
00:49:18.411 --> 00:49:21.247
At the end of the path

694
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:31.090
Feel, in the depths of despair

695
00:49:31.174 --> 00:49:33.009
A surging wave of hope

696
00:49:33.051 --> 00:49:36.137
The fervor of life

697
00:49:36.221 --> 00:49:38.848
The glorious path

698
00:50:15.927 --> 00:50:18.179
Get your arithmetic notebooks.

699
00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:25.812
You're the one making them sing?

700
00:50:25.895 --> 00:50:27.355
Yes, sir.

701
00:50:27.438 --> 00:50:29.941
- Is that a criticism?
- Of course not.


702
00:50:30.024 --> 00:50:34.153
I adore music.
Occasionally I even sing a little.


703
00:50:34.237 --> 00:50:35.196
Really?

704
00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.740
Why are we waiting?
Let's get happy


705
00:50:37.782 --> 00:50:41.411
Why are we waiting?
Let's have a ball


706
00:50:45.748 --> 00:50:48.626
- Have a nice day.
- You too, dear colleague.


707
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:53.423
Arithmetic. Page 27.

708
00:51:26.122 --> 00:51:28.458
Good day.

709
00:51:28.541 --> 00:51:30.460
Good day, madame.

710
00:51:30.543 --> 00:51:33.338
- Pierre has been told. He's coming.
- Is something wrong?


711
00:51:33.421 --> 00:51:35.548
Everything's fine.

712
00:51:35.632 --> 00:51:38.843
- What about his teeth?
- Not a problem anymore.


713
00:51:38.885 --> 00:51:41.721
Did you tell him
I came for a visit?

714
00:51:41.804 --> 00:51:43.306
No.

715
00:51:43.348 --> 00:51:45.016
Why not?

716
00:51:45.099 --> 00:51:49.604
I thought I'd better not.
Pierre is very sensitive...


717
00:51:49.646 --> 00:51:51.147
...and gifted.

718
00:51:51.189 --> 00:51:53.483
At acting like an idiot, yes.

719
00:51:53.524 --> 00:51:58.696
Not exclusively. By the way,
I need to talk to you.


720
00:51:59.572 --> 00:52:02.200
Singing? No one taught him.

721
00:52:02.242 --> 00:52:04.827
It's a gift.
We have to do something.


722
00:52:07.205 --> 00:52:08.790
Hello.

723
00:52:10.166 --> 00:52:13.878
I'll leave you two alone.
Visit him whenever you like.


724
00:52:17.006 --> 00:52:19.634
I told her you went
to the dentist last time.


725
00:52:19.717 --> 00:52:21.678
Don't give me away.

726
00:52:46.035 --> 00:52:48.538
- So you're a good singer?
- Yeah.


727
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:55.545
That man seems
to think you're doing well.


728
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:58.256
Is he nice to you?

729
00:52:58.339 --> 00:52:59.841
He's all right.

730
00:53:03.011 --> 00:53:05.471
I brought you some clean clothes

731
00:53:05.555 --> 00:53:08.224
and I made your chocolate cake.

732
00:53:09.392 --> 00:53:11.394
Are you happy?

733
00:53:21.237 --> 00:53:23.740
April. Those children inspire me.

734
00:53:23.781 --> 00:53:27.493
I knew that one day,
someone would play my music.


735
00:53:27.577 --> 00:53:29.454
My name is Clément Mathieu.

736
00:53:29.537 --> 00:53:33.041
I'm a musician and each night,
I compose for them.


737
00:54:13.373 --> 00:54:19.379
Like a caress on the ocean

738
00:54:20.088 --> 00:54:26.094
Lightly lands the gull

739
00:54:26.719 --> 00:54:32.684
On the rocks of a sunken isle

740
00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:42.026
Ephemeral winter breeze

741
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:49.033
At last your cold breath fades away

742
00:54:50.076 --> 00:54:54.622
Far into the mountains high

743
00:54:54.706 --> 00:54:57.917
Face the wind
and spread your wings


744
00:54:57.959 --> 00:55:00.503
In the gray eastern dawn

745
00:55:00.587 --> 00:55:03.172
Find a path to the rainbow

746
00:55:03.256 --> 00:55:06.676
And spring will reveal
itself to you


747
00:55:06.759 --> 00:55:09.804
Calmly

748
00:55:09.846 --> 00:55:15.852
On the ocean

749
00:55:21.357 --> 00:55:22.859
No good, sir?

750
00:55:22.942 --> 00:55:25.528
It was nice.

751
00:55:25.653 --> 00:55:27.280
Very nice.

752
00:55:27.322 --> 00:55:29.532
Move, you swine.

753
00:55:29.657 --> 00:55:31.326
Little shit. Move.

754
00:55:31.409 --> 00:55:32.911
Move.

755
00:55:32.994 --> 00:55:35.747
- What did he do?
- He stole my watch.


756
00:55:35.872 --> 00:55:38.791
I caught him in my bedroom.
So I brought him to Rachin.


757
00:55:38.917 --> 00:55:40.376
Action-reaction.

758
00:55:40.418 --> 00:55:43.338
- Where are you taking him?
- Lock-up. Fifteen days. Move.


759
00:55:43.379 --> 00:55:45.340
- Wait.
- Wait for what?


760
00:55:46.382 --> 00:55:48.384
He's my only baritone.

761
00:55:53.723 --> 00:55:55.391
Yes, Headmaster?

762
00:55:55.475 --> 00:55:57.477
I found more graffiti in the...

763
00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:03.650
Forgive them, Headmaster.
It's just a wild ball.


764
00:56:05.652 --> 00:56:07.320
Make way.

765
00:56:08.321 --> 00:56:10.949
Mathieu, Chabert...

766
00:56:13.201 --> 00:56:15.161
...you're with me.

767
00:56:17.330 --> 00:56:21.751
May. With each passing week,
I take in new victories.


768
00:56:21.793 --> 00:56:24.337
Wake-up time. Get up.

769
00:56:32.804 --> 00:56:34.347
- Leclerc.
- Yeah?


770
00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:36.349
- We're still friends?
- Yeah, why?


771
00:56:36.432 --> 00:56:37.850
Five and three add up to what?

772
00:56:37.934 --> 00:56:40.144
- Fifty-three.
- Are you sure?


773
00:56:40.228 --> 00:56:42.063
- Yeah.
- Thanks.


774
00:57:02.125 --> 00:57:04.294
Perhaps it's an illusion,

775
00:57:04.377 --> 00:57:07.547
but even our headmaster
seems to be changing.


776
00:57:50.757 --> 00:57:52.133
Five.

777
00:57:56.012 --> 00:57:58.473
Look, it's old Maxence.

778
00:58:08.608 --> 00:58:10.485
Nobody move.

779
00:58:12.028 --> 00:58:13.613
Smile.

780
00:58:19.452 --> 00:58:21.913
Come on. Come out, Mondain.

781
00:58:31.714 --> 00:58:34.592
It's over, kid.

782
00:58:43.101 --> 00:58:45.520
Come on. One, two...

783
00:58:51.734 --> 00:58:56.197
Chabert, I just told Mr. Rachin
that Mathieu's chorus is sensational.


784
00:58:56.281 --> 00:58:57.949
Hurry up.

785
00:58:58.032 --> 00:59:00.743
- I'm tired.
- You're always tired. 29.


786
00:59:00.868 --> 00:59:04.163
- What did he say?
- "Get lost." That's it.


787
00:59:05.206 --> 00:59:07.250
Where's Mondain?

788
00:59:09.294 --> 00:59:11.671
You didn't notice
he was gone before the run?


789
00:59:11.754 --> 00:59:14.883
He attended roll call this morning,
Headmaster. He left later.


790
00:59:14.966 --> 00:59:17.427
No one goes out
for the rest of the year.


791
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:20.388
- How much did he take?
- Almost 200,000 francs.


792
00:59:20.471 --> 00:59:22.765
How will I pay our suppliers?

793
00:59:22.807 --> 00:59:25.435
I should never have taken him.

794
00:59:25.518 --> 00:59:28.521
All for the sake of an experience.
Experience my...


795
00:59:28.563 --> 00:59:31.357
Just like your music.

796
00:59:34.485 --> 00:59:37.238
I won't order coal
for the boiler until next week.


797
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:39.741
In the meantime, 
I'm calling the police.

798
00:59:40.533 --> 00:59:42.535
When Rachin in his coffin lay

799
00:59:42.577 --> 00:59:45.121
His cock was hard, they say

800
00:59:45.163 --> 00:59:48.416
His cock was his last bid
to lift up the coffin lid


801
00:59:48.458 --> 00:59:52.337
Yes, indeed, he's a funny breed

802
01:00:01.471 --> 01:00:04.140
Singing is really developing
their minds, Mathieu.


803
01:00:04.224 --> 01:00:06.226
Very impressive.

804
01:00:06.267 --> 01:00:08.645
They've spent three weeks
without hot water.


805
01:00:08.686 --> 01:00:11.189
Cold water activates
the circulation. Get out.


806
01:00:13.733 --> 01:00:16.444
By the way, Mathieu,
forget the chorus.


807
01:00:18.863 --> 01:00:21.741
- But, Headmaster...
- Thank you, Mr. Mathieu.


808
01:00:21.824 --> 01:00:23.952
Give me the police.

809
01:00:32.544 --> 01:00:34.420
I don't know what to do
about the chorus,


810
01:00:34.462 --> 01:00:37.674
but for the kids,
we can use wood.


811
01:00:37.799 --> 01:00:39.717
We're out of wood.

812
01:00:44.806 --> 01:00:46.558
Here.

813
01:00:46.641 --> 01:00:49.602
The headmaster's private stock.

814
01:00:49.686 --> 01:00:52.230
Chabert. Action-reaction.

815
01:00:52.313 --> 01:00:53.648
Chabert surprised me.

816
01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:55.942
I used to think he was
Rachin's zealous double,


817
01:00:56.025 --> 01:00:58.945
but I discovered
that he was a nice guy


818
01:00:58.987 --> 01:01:02.532
for whom sports and music were
the key elements of national unity.


819
01:01:02.615 --> 01:01:04.450
Le Querrec, are you invisible?

820
01:01:04.534 --> 01:01:07.787
With his help,
I'm organizing the resistance.


821
01:01:08.788 --> 01:01:11.332
Our chorus is going underground.

822
01:01:35.523 --> 01:01:38.526
You tend to lower your pitch
at the end of a verse.


823
01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:41.279
For the last time,
please detach every single note.


824
01:01:41.821 --> 01:01:43.823
It's late. Let's stop.

825
01:01:43.907 --> 01:01:46.576
Sir, what about the second part?

826
01:01:46.659 --> 01:01:49.120
- I didn't teach you the solo.
- I learned it.


827
01:01:49.203 --> 01:01:51.414
How could you learn it?

828
01:01:55.293 --> 01:01:57.253
All right. Second part.

829
01:02:39.087 --> 01:02:40.713
Get out.

830
01:02:42.298 --> 01:02:47.262
On May 13, just after 3:00,
Mondain came back.


831
01:03:00.275 --> 01:03:02.277
- Where's the money?
- I don't know.


832
01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.362
- So who stole it?
- It wasn't me.


833
01:03:06.239 --> 01:03:08.241
Do you want more?

834
01:03:08.324 --> 01:03:09.325
So?

835
01:03:10.493 --> 01:03:13.079
- He's been hitting him?
- For half an hour.


836
01:03:13.162 --> 01:03:15.665
- He's crazy.
- And he's wasting his time.


837
01:03:15.707 --> 01:03:17.542
The boy won't talk.

838
01:03:19.669 --> 01:03:22.255
Very well.

839
01:03:22.338 --> 01:03:24.841
Let's start from the beginning.

840
01:03:24.883 --> 01:03:27.427
Where's the money?

841
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:28.678
Speak!

842
01:03:31.264 --> 01:03:33.099
Where's the money?

843
01:03:36.144 --> 01:03:37.687
Let him go!

844
01:03:38.771 --> 01:03:40.231
Let him go.

845
01:03:43.318 --> 01:03:44.986
Calm down.

846
01:03:45.069 --> 01:03:46.946
Calm down!

847
01:03:48.114 --> 01:03:51.367
The boy just confessed. Excellent.
I'm calling the police.


848
01:03:52.285 --> 01:03:54.954
You're going to see
new horizons, my boy.


849
01:03:55.038 --> 01:03:57.498
With new guards and brand-new bars.

850
01:04:17.185 --> 01:04:20.021
In order to spare
the children's fragile trust,


851
01:04:20.063 --> 01:04:22.941
we hid Mondain's fate from them.

852
01:04:24.692 --> 01:04:28.196
Officially, he had gone back
to his old school.


853
01:04:29.405 --> 01:04:31.574
One hen

854
01:04:31.658 --> 01:04:34.535
produces an average...

855
01:04:35.995 --> 01:04:39.999
...of 84 eggs a year.

856
01:04:41.668 --> 01:04:44.212
Well-fed...

857
01:04:45.588 --> 01:04:48.508
...and kept...
- I saw Rachin's daughters today.


858
01:04:48.591 --> 01:04:49.676
Naked?

859
01:04:49.717 --> 01:04:51.678
- No.
...inside a well-ventilated...


860
01:04:51.719 --> 01:04:56.975
...and clean henhouse,
the same hen will lay 150 eggs.


861
01:04:58.059 --> 01:05:04.065
Under such conditions,
how many more eggs could...


862
01:05:04.107 --> 01:05:09.529
...a farmer get...

863
01:05:09.571 --> 01:05:11.656
...out of her nine hens?

864
01:05:26.588 --> 01:05:28.423
Nice day.

865
01:05:29.591 --> 01:05:33.094
It's nice to feel the sun.
Summer will soon be here.


866
01:05:37.181 --> 01:05:40.393
Pierre is a constant source
of surprise to me.


867
01:05:40.476 --> 01:05:43.730
I wanted to thank you for helping him.

868
01:05:43.771 --> 01:05:46.941
I'm doing it for you too.

869
01:05:47.025 --> 01:05:50.069
I mean, if Pierre is doing well,
you're doing well, so...


870
01:05:54.407 --> 01:05:56.409
- Let me.
- It's nothing.


871
01:05:57.827 --> 01:05:59.078
It's only ink.

872
01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:03.082
- Why are you such an ass?
- You want to send us to lock-up?


873
01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:05.627
What's going on?

874
01:06:07.253 --> 01:06:09.422
Why are you hitting him?

875
01:06:10.465 --> 01:06:11.966
Tell me, Bébert.

876
01:06:12.008 --> 01:06:14.969
Because Morhange threw the ink.

877
01:06:15.303 --> 01:06:18.431
You couldn't just shut up?

878
01:06:18.556 --> 01:06:20.892
I'm ashamed of you, Pierre.

879
01:06:23.436 --> 01:06:25.438
Wait.

880
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.316
It doesn't matter. 
It's only ink.

881
01:06:29.359 --> 01:06:32.195
It's just pride
because you're beautiful.


882
01:06:32.278 --> 01:06:33.321
Beautiful?

883
01:06:33.363 --> 01:06:36.616
You're nothing like
the other mothers who come here.


884
01:06:36.699 --> 01:06:38.701
Because I live alone?

885
01:06:38.785 --> 01:06:40.537
So do I.

886
01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:42.956
- But you have no children.
- No.


887
01:06:43.081 --> 01:06:45.083
In fact, I've got 60 kids.

888
01:06:45.124 --> 01:06:48.419
When you come here,
they see the woman of their dreams.


889
01:06:48.503 --> 01:06:51.839
Well, the mother
they've all imagined.


890
01:06:51.881 --> 01:06:54.342
It's different for Pierre.
You are his mother.


891
01:06:54.425 --> 01:06:57.845
Like any other child,
he doesn't like to share.


892
01:06:57.887 --> 01:06:59.889
We have to get him out of there.

893
01:06:59.973 --> 01:07:04.519
- He should go to music school.
- I want him to learn a good trade.


894
01:07:04.602 --> 01:07:08.314
Music is a good trade,
as long as you've been well taught.


895
01:07:08.398 --> 01:07:10.775
He could go to the Conservatory in Lyon.

896
01:07:10.858 --> 01:07:13.278
I'd follow his progress
to prevent any bad habits.


897
01:07:13.361 --> 01:07:15.863
Even there, he could meet
mediocre teachers.


898
01:07:15.947 --> 01:07:17.407
And later?

899
01:07:17.490 --> 01:07:20.201
He'll become who he should be.

900
01:07:22.203 --> 01:07:26.416
Pierre is special, and I'll do anything
to help him achieve his dreams.


901
01:07:26.499 --> 01:07:28.501
I need your help too.

902
01:07:28.543 --> 01:07:30.503
I understand.

903
01:07:30.545 --> 01:07:32.088
Thank you.

904
01:07:56.779 --> 01:07:58.364
No, it's all wrong.

905
01:07:58.448 --> 01:08:00.950
What's the matter?
Are you asleep?


906
01:08:01.034 --> 01:08:02.869
Boniface, your posture.

907
01:08:02.952 --> 01:08:05.622
How can you sing that way?
Stand up straight.


908
01:08:06.748 --> 01:08:09.459
From "Such a sweet concert".

909
01:08:44.202 --> 01:08:46.120
What about my solo?

910
01:08:46.204 --> 01:08:47.705
What solo?

911
01:08:47.789 --> 01:08:49.082
My solo.

912
01:08:49.165 --> 01:08:51.709
Your solo, right. It's gone.

913
01:08:51.793 --> 01:08:54.546
Your voice isn't bad,
but nobody's indispensable.


914
01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:58.424
I don't care if you sing or not.
We can do it without you. Listen.


915
01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:01.553
Start from...

916
01:09:04.764 --> 01:09:07.559
Let's start from O night.

917
01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.105
O Night

918
01:09:12.188 --> 01:09:16.442
Bring to

919
01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:19.445
The Earth

920
01:09:19.487 --> 01:09:24.367
The enchanting calm

921
01:09:24.450 --> 01:09:28.246
Of your mystery

922
01:09:28.371 --> 01:09:30.415
Mathieu.

923
01:09:30.498 --> 01:09:33.668
- You're going to get it, sir.
- Mr. Chabert said he was in town.


924
01:09:33.751 --> 01:09:36.254
Thank you, children.
You can go outside.


925
01:09:45.054 --> 01:09:47.515
You do know that you're
annoying me?


926
01:09:47.599 --> 01:09:50.602
Headmaster, I assure you,
all their homework is done.


927
01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:53.688
Our lady benefactresses
heard about your chorus.


928
01:09:53.771 --> 01:09:58.067
A personal letter from the Countess.
She's coming on Sunday, with friends.


929
01:09:58.151 --> 01:10:00.069
- They want to hear this.
- Wonderful.


930
01:10:00.153 --> 01:10:02.322
Well, it's nice.

931
01:10:02.363 --> 01:10:05.199
I can imagine the scene.
Airs and graces, music.


932
01:10:05.283 --> 01:10:07.202
Some pastries perhaps?

933
01:10:07.285 --> 01:10:10.246
I have to bear the brunt
of your idiocies.


934
01:10:11.331 --> 01:10:15.335
Headmaster, you have to admit music
doesn't interfere with discipline.


935
01:10:15.418 --> 01:10:18.046
- We've had fewer problems lately.
- Chance.


936
01:10:18.087 --> 01:10:21.299
- I don't believe in chance, Headmaster.
- I realize that.


937
01:10:21.424 --> 01:10:24.219
Who else could have told
the Foundation?


938
01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.637
I did.

939
01:10:28.181 --> 01:10:29.849
You can write?

940
01:10:29.933 --> 01:10:33.228
- Mr. Maxence acted for the best...
- Spare me your comments.


941
01:10:33.269 --> 01:10:35.271
I don't like your manners, Mathieu.

942
01:10:35.355 --> 01:10:37.357
You don't like anything, Headmaster.

943
01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.401
Mr. Rachin. You're wanted
in the visiting room.


944
01:10:42.612 --> 01:10:43.988
Later.

945
01:10:47.492 --> 01:10:49.619
This is for you.

946
01:10:49.702 --> 01:10:52.789
Sometimes I think we should have
let Mondain strangle him.


947
01:10:57.335 --> 01:11:00.255
Violette was thanking me
for helping her son.


948
01:11:00.296 --> 01:11:04.968
She wanted to speak to me privately
to share some important news


949
01:11:05.051 --> 01:11:08.680
at the Café de la Place,
on the 20th, at 4:00.


950
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:13.560
I wrote to the Conservatory in Lyon.
I'm acquainted with the director.


951
01:11:13.601 --> 01:11:17.188
He was very nice about it.
He'll be happy to give him an audition


952
01:11:17.272 --> 01:11:21.234
and if he's admitted, he'll try
very hard to get him a scholarship.


953
01:11:22.777 --> 01:11:26.197
I believe things are about to change
for the better.


954
01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:27.782
Really?

955
01:11:28.116 --> 01:11:31.035
Since I met you,

956
01:11:31.077 --> 01:11:34.497
I... well...

957
01:11:34.539 --> 01:11:37.166
...my life has... 
How can I say it?

958
01:11:38.209 --> 01:11:39.544
Changed dramatically?

959
01:11:39.627 --> 01:11:41.212
Yes.

960
01:11:42.255 --> 01:11:44.674
Thanks to you.

961
01:11:44.757 --> 01:11:48.177
- It's such a surprise.
- I'd lost faith too.


962
01:11:49.804 --> 01:11:53.349
Maybe I shouldn't get my hopes up yet.

963
01:11:53.433 --> 01:11:56.227
You can trust me.

964
01:11:57.103 --> 01:11:59.689
You did bring me luck.

965
01:11:59.731 --> 01:12:00.940
Luck?

966
01:12:05.695 --> 01:12:07.280
I met someone.

967
01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.160
He's an engineer.
From Lyon, of all things.


968
01:12:12.243 --> 01:12:17.248
I met him at the café.
He's building a bridge in the area.


969
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:26.174
Are you all right?

970
01:12:26.257 --> 01:12:30.220
I'm fine. It's a great opportunity
for you and for Pierre.


971
01:12:33.306 --> 01:12:36.017
Don't be upset, but I have to go.

972
01:12:36.142 --> 01:12:38.811
I'd like the three of us
to have lunch someday.


973
01:12:40.396 --> 01:12:43.650
You can tell him all about Pierre.
Will you do it?


974
01:12:43.733 --> 01:12:45.568
Why not?

975
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:48.905
Goodbye.

976
01:12:50.448 --> 01:12:51.908
Goodbye.

977
01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.413
Thank you for everything.

978
01:13:00.583 --> 01:13:02.293
I almost forgot.

979
01:13:02.335 --> 01:13:04.420
Don't tell Pierre right away.

980
01:13:18.726 --> 01:13:20.895
Excuse me. May I take the chair?

981
01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:22.814
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.


982
01:14:49.317 --> 01:14:52.237
Countess, a few flowers.

983
01:14:52.278 --> 01:14:55.490
I didn't understand everything,
but I got the feelings.


984
01:14:55.573 --> 01:14:57.242
Thank you, child.

985
01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.285
Take these.

986
01:14:59.369 --> 01:15:03.456
Countess, let me introduce
Mr. Mathieu, our prefect,


987
01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:05.792
who's in charge of the chorus.

988
01:15:05.875 --> 01:15:08.211
- Countess.
- Well done, sir.


989
01:15:08.294 --> 01:15:13.216
Mr. Rachin's humane teaching style
is of great interest to us,


990
01:15:13.299 --> 01:15:16.010
and we thank you for your support.

991
01:15:16.052 --> 01:15:19.055
By the way, who decided
to form a chorus?


992
01:15:19.097 --> 01:15:21.683
- Well...
- I did, Countess.


993
01:15:21.766 --> 01:15:23.226
I did.

994
01:15:23.309 --> 01:15:25.770
Indeed, Countess,

995
01:15:25.812 --> 01:15:28.898
I'm very happy to help
such an understanding headmaster.


996
01:15:28.982 --> 01:15:31.317
Well, let them sing.

997
01:15:33.528 --> 01:15:36.281
He's too modest
to enjoy compliments.


998
01:15:36.364 --> 01:15:40.577
- Very true.
- What are they going to sing for us?


999
01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:43.580
Rameau's Hymn to Night,
Countess.


1000
01:15:43.663 --> 01:15:45.540
It must be marvelous.

1001
01:15:48.668 --> 01:15:50.420
Excuse me?

1002
01:15:50.461 --> 01:15:54.007
Who's the little boy standing aside?
Has he been punished?


1003
01:15:54.090 --> 01:15:56.342
- That one?
- Yes.


1004
01:15:56.384 --> 01:15:58.553
He's a special case.

1005
01:15:58.636 --> 01:16:00.430
May I?

1006
01:16:12.692 --> 01:16:16.362
O Night

1007
01:16:16.487 --> 01:16:20.658
Bring to

1008
01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:24.245
The Earth

1009
01:16:24.287 --> 01:16:28.666
The enchanting calm

1010
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:34.714
Of your mystery

1011
01:16:34.839 --> 01:16:38.593
The shadow which follows you

1012
01:16:38.635 --> 01:16:41.638
Is so sweet

1013
01:16:41.679 --> 01:16:46.768
It is such a sweet concert

1014
01:16:46.809 --> 01:16:52.815
Your voices chanting hope

1015
01:16:53.399 --> 01:16:57.612
Your power is so great

1016
01:16:57.695 --> 01:17:01.783
Transforming all into a dream

1017
01:17:25.056 --> 01:17:28.601
O Night

1018
01:17:29.769 --> 01:17:33.982
O leave still

1019
01:17:34.065 --> 01:17:37.777
To the Earth

1020
01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:42.156
The enchanting calm

1021
01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:48.246
Of your mystery

1022
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:53.626
The shadow which follows you

1023
01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:56.004
Is so sweet

1024
01:17:56.045 --> 01:18:00.717
Is there anything more beautiful

1025
01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:06.431
Than a dream?

1026
01:18:06.514 --> 01:18:11.269
Is there any truth

1027
01:18:11.352 --> 01:18:14.272
Sweeter

1028
01:18:14.355 --> 01:18:20.361
Than hope?

1029
01:18:35.835 --> 01:18:39.130
Morhange's eyes followed my tempo,

1030
01:18:39.172 --> 01:18:41.841
and in them,
I suddenly read many things:


1031
01:18:41.925 --> 01:18:44.802
pride and
the joy of my forgiveness,


1032
01:18:44.886 --> 01:18:47.805
but also something quite new to him.

1033
01:18:47.889 --> 01:18:49.766
A feeling of gratitude.

1034
01:18:51.935 --> 01:18:54.270
First day of summer.

1035
01:18:54.354 --> 01:18:57.148
Our chorus has a new member.

1036
01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:05.156
I'm sorry, I missed the reprise.
My fault. Go on.


1037
01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.991
All right. Again.

1038
01:19:32.183 --> 01:19:35.853
In their eyes,
I can see the desire to flee,


1039
01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:38.481
to build a hut
way up in the sky.

1040
01:19:38.565 --> 01:19:41.025
This fine weather makes them sad.

1041
01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:03.631
You have to see this. 
It's important.

1042
01:20:06.843 --> 01:20:09.470
While I was cleaning graffiti
off the toilet walls,


1043
01:20:09.554 --> 01:20:12.015
I lifted a stone and found this.

1044
01:20:12.724 --> 01:20:15.018
- That's Corbin's harmonica.
- And that.


1045
01:20:15.101 --> 01:20:17.228
It's 200,000 or more.

1046
01:20:26.905 --> 01:20:29.157
No one knew about your hideaway.

1047
01:20:30.700 --> 01:20:33.786
So don't tell me
it was there by chance.


1048
01:20:33.828 --> 01:20:36.873
You know they expelled Mondain
because of the theft.


1049
01:20:36.956 --> 01:20:38.917
I didn't know.

1050
01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.086
That's true. You didn't know.

1051
01:20:42.128 --> 01:20:44.130
Now you know.

1052
01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.674
Why? What did you
want to do with it?

1053
01:20:48.134 --> 01:20:50.720
If I tell you,
will you tell anyone else?


1054
01:20:50.803 --> 01:20:52.430
No one.

1055
01:20:52.472 --> 01:20:54.474
I swear.

1056
01:20:56.476 --> 01:20:58.561
I wanted to buy...

1057
01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:00.563
To buy what?

1058
01:21:01.397 --> 01:21:03.524
A hot air balloon.

1059
01:21:04.943 --> 01:21:07.987
I don't know who took it,
but it proves Mondain's innocence.


1060
01:21:08.071 --> 01:21:10.532
He'd never have left without the money.

1061
01:21:10.573 --> 01:21:13.034
I'll investigate when I come back.

1062
01:21:13.117 --> 01:21:15.161
But don't worry about it, Mathieu.

1063
01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:19.249
Even if Mondain was innocent,
it won't last. We can't help his type.


1064
01:21:19.332 --> 01:21:22.669
- What about justice?
- Let her take care of him.


1065
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:24.963
Headmaster, wait for me.
Wait for me.


1066
01:21:25.004 --> 01:21:26.965
Are you leaving too?

1067
01:21:27.006 --> 01:21:30.134
I'm getting a lift. I'm spending
the holidays with relatives.


1068
01:21:30.176 --> 01:21:31.970
At my sister's house.

1069
01:21:33.137 --> 01:21:34.973
They have a piano.

1070
01:21:44.607 --> 01:21:46.526
Do you know why Rachin
went to Lyon?


1071
01:21:46.609 --> 01:21:50.488
I think he's supposed to discuss
the balance sheet with the committee.


1072
01:21:51.656 --> 01:21:53.283
- No?
- Yes.


1073
01:21:53.366 --> 01:21:57.120
But he's mostly going to run
after a promotion and a medal.


1074
01:21:58.329 --> 01:22:00.790
Do you think he'll get them?

1075
01:22:00.832 --> 01:22:04.669
He's really smart. He's going
to present an impeccable report


1076
01:22:04.711 --> 01:22:08.047
without saying a word
about all the horrible things.


1077
01:22:08.131 --> 01:22:11.050
He'll even claim the success
of the chorus for himself.


1078
01:22:11.134 --> 01:22:12.135
Success?

1079
01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:14.804
Certainly. I heard them.
They're good.


1080
01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:18.766
Sir, is it true that
Langlois left with the head?


1081
01:22:18.808 --> 01:22:22.145
Yes. Chabert and Carpentier
have taken two weeks' holidays.


1082
01:22:22.186 --> 01:22:24.772
- We're in charge.
- There's no class today?


1083
01:22:26.941 --> 01:22:28.318
No.

1084
01:22:28.359 --> 01:22:30.904
- What are we going to do?
- Take a nap.


1085
01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:33.448
I have a better idea.

1086
01:22:37.869 --> 01:22:39.495
Thank you.

1087
01:22:39.579 --> 01:22:42.665
I don't want to...

1088
01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:45.168
- Your rosette?
- Yes.


1089
01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.422
The bird is in the nest, Mr. Rachin.

1090
01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:53.259
I can't thank you enough.

1091
01:22:55.595 --> 01:22:58.514
I'm sorry, Headmaster.
You're wanted on the telephone.


1092
01:23:04.395 --> 01:23:05.980
I'm sorry.

1093
01:23:23.998 --> 01:23:25.375
Headmaster!

1094
01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:29.170
- Do something. My son is up there.
- Let me through.


1095
01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:31.714
The fire had caught under the eaves.

1096
01:23:31.798 --> 01:23:35.677
The dormitories, where the children
had last been seen, were in flames.


1097
01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.845
Sixty unfortunate children,

1098
01:23:37.929 --> 01:23:40.098
caught in a snare.

1099
01:23:40.181 --> 01:23:42.850
Rachin saw his promotion
and his rosette


1100
01:23:42.892 --> 01:23:45.061
destroyed before his very eyes.

1101
01:23:45.144 --> 01:23:46.938
But, suddenly...

1102
01:24:36.279 --> 01:24:40.617
After breakfast, we used the door
leading out of the vegetable patch


1103
01:24:40.658 --> 01:24:43.786
to avoid old Marie and the villagers.

1104
01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:45.788
We went to the forest of Lignan.

1105
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:48.124
For what purpose?

1106
01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:51.711
A treasure hunt.
They were so happy.


1107
01:24:54.964 --> 01:24:59.135
I don't need to tell you
how disappointed I am, Mr. Maxence.


1108
01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:02.138
This was entirely my idea, Headmaster.

1109
01:25:02.222 --> 01:25:05.975
Mr. Maxence never stopped
trying to dissuade me.


1110
01:25:06.059 --> 01:25:07.644
Not very convincing.

1111
01:25:07.685 --> 01:25:11.648
We could also consider the fact
that we saved the children's lives.


1112
01:25:11.731 --> 01:25:15.360
If you hadn't left the school,
it wouldn't have caught fire.


1113
01:25:15.443 --> 01:25:17.946
I don't even know
why I'm listening to you.


1114
01:25:18.029 --> 01:25:23.076
Mr. Maxence, owing to your long years
of service, I'll just suspend you.


1115
01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.788
As for you, Mr. 
Mathieu, you're fired.

1116
01:25:26.871 --> 01:25:29.040
For breaking the rules.

1117
01:25:29.082 --> 01:25:31.084
Then you should fire me too.

1118
01:25:31.125 --> 01:25:33.086
You don't get to decide.

1119
01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:37.257
It's nice of you, Mr. Maxence,
but you're needed here.


1120
01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:40.802
Think about the children,
since this gentleman never does.


1121
01:25:44.055 --> 01:25:46.391
I've settled up with you. Here.

1122
01:25:46.432 --> 01:25:49.686
You're leaving right now,
on the 6:00 bus.


1123
01:25:49.727 --> 01:25:52.939
You're allowed no contact
with your former students. None.


1124
01:25:53.022 --> 01:25:55.483
- What?
- Mr. Maxence, see to it.


1125
01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:57.360
Get out.

1126
01:26:01.531 --> 01:26:06.953
Headmaster, before I go,
I'll tell you what I think of you.


1127
01:26:07.036 --> 01:26:10.123
- I already know, Mathieu.
- You're an incompetent,


1128
01:26:10.164 --> 01:26:12.333
- truly evil man.
- What about them?


1129
01:26:12.417 --> 01:26:14.377
They're not here by choice.

1130
01:26:14.460 --> 01:26:16.796
Neither am I.
I never wanted to be a teacher.


1131
01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:19.841
Don't tell me you wanted to come
to that miserable place.


1132
01:26:19.924 --> 01:26:23.052
- You had other ambitions? So did I.
- Don't take it out on them.


1133
01:26:23.094 --> 01:26:25.638
Do you think I like being a warden?

1134
01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.640
Someone has to do it.

1135
01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:30.977
Pack up your bags and go to Paris.
Make the Ministry rounds.


1136
01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:33.104
Knock-knock.
"Hello. My name is Mathieu.


1137
01:26:33.187 --> 01:26:35.398
We need real teachers
instead of washouts."


1138
01:26:35.481 --> 01:26:37.984
Fight for the cause
if you believe in it, Mathieu.


1139
01:26:38.067 --> 01:26:40.361
Saint Mathieu.

1140
01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:42.697
You're nothing but a failed musician.

1141
01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:45.867
A prefect. A small prefect.
Small, small, small.


1142
01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:49.329
"What do you do, Mr. Mathieu?"
"I'm a prefect."


1143
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.831
Small. Small. Small.

1144
01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:54.459
You're crazy.

1145
01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:56.127
I'm tired.

1146
01:26:56.211 --> 01:26:57.837
Go to the devil.

1147
01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:00.423
No, I'm leaving him behind.

1148
01:27:13.436 --> 01:27:17.941
I had hoped a few students
would break the rules to say goodbye.


1149
01:27:17.982 --> 01:27:19.984
I saw no one.

1150
01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:23.363
The wisdom of these children
came across as indifference.


1151
01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:26.449
And Morhange...

1152
01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:28.326
Enough.

1153
01:27:47.178 --> 01:27:49.013
"See you soon, Mr. Mathieu."

1154
01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:50.598
"Goodbye, Chrome Dome."

1155
01:27:59.774 --> 01:28:03.069
On the first note, I recognized
Boniface's careful script.


1156
01:28:03.152 --> 01:28:07.323
The spelling mistakes
were Pépinot's, of course.


1157
01:28:07.407 --> 01:28:10.994
This one, filled with music notes,
came from Morhange.


1158
01:28:12.078 --> 01:28:14.247
And this one...

1159
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:15.832
And that one...

1160
01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:42.525
Be silent! Make them stop!

1161
01:28:42.567 --> 01:28:44.777
The door's locked.

1162
01:28:44.861 --> 01:28:46.529
Open up!

1163
01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:50.742
Right then I felt a sudden burst
ofjoy and optimism.


1164
01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:53.286
I wanted to share it
with the entire world.


1165
01:28:53.369 --> 01:28:55.371
But who would have listened?

1166
01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:58.249
No one even knew I was alive.

1167
01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:02.212
The great artist would soon
give way to the ordinary man.


1168
01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:05.340
I'm Clément Mathieu,

1169
01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:08.343
a failed musician,
an unemployed prefect.


1170
01:29:08.426 --> 01:29:10.511
"I'm Clément Mathieu,

1171
01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:14.432
a failed musician,
an unemployed prefect."


1172
01:29:28.446 --> 01:29:30.698
What happened next?

1173
01:29:30.740 --> 01:29:33.743
He never finished his journal.

1174
01:29:36.287 --> 01:29:39.040
But I can tell you the story.

1175
01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:44.045
Pépinot answered my questions.

1176
01:29:44.087 --> 01:29:49.133
The following day, on the way back,
my childhood caught me by the throat.


1177
01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:54.138
When Mathieu was fired,
my mother took me back home.


1178
01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:57.350
We left for Lyon, where
I was admitted to the Conservatory.


1179
01:29:58.935 --> 01:30:01.396
The engineer tried
to send me to boarding school.


1180
01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:04.357
She refused. He left us.

1181
01:30:05.108 --> 01:30:11.114
Chabert, Langlois and old Maxence
joined forces to expose Rachin's abuse.


1182
01:30:11.155 --> 01:30:15.243
The children were questioned
and Rachin was fired.


1183
01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:24.085
Clément Mathieu gave music lessons
for the rest of his life,


1184
01:30:24.168 --> 01:30:26.671
without courting notoriety.

1185
01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:29.465
Everything he did, he kept for himself.

1186
01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:33.761
For himself? No, not quite.

1187
01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:35.638
Mr. Mathieu.

1188
01:30:38.057 --> 01:30:39.851
Mr. Mathieu.

1189
01:30:42.228 --> 01:30:43.980
Wait a bit.

1190
01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:48.943
Mr. Mathieu.

1191
01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:55.950
What are you doing?

1192
01:30:56.034 --> 01:30:58.620
Can you take me with you?

1193
01:30:58.703 --> 01:31:00.163
Sir.

1194
01:31:00.205 --> 01:31:04.167
I can't do that. You have to go back
to school. They'll punish you.


1195
01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:05.251
Please?

1196
01:31:05.335 --> 01:31:07.545
- Can we go now?
- Coming.


1197
01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:10.798
It's forbidden.
I can't take you with me.


1198
01:31:10.882 --> 01:31:12.550
Go back.

1199
01:31:12.634 --> 01:31:14.302
Go on.

1200
01:31:14.636 --> 01:31:16.304
Go on.

1201
01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:44.457
Pépinot had been right all along.

1202
01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:47.335
Mathieu was fired on a Saturday.
