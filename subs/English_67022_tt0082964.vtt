00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.810
(soft music)

2
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.650
(honking)

3
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.130
- Mado, look at this.

4
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.170
Napoleon's.

5
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.490
- Napoleon's?
- Mm-hmm. Napoleon's sabre.


6
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.690
(in French):

7
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.530
One of his sabres, I suppose.

8
00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.730
He must've had several of them.

9
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.290
A man like Napoleon.

10
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.730
(distant shouting)

11
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.450
- Stephan?

12
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:43.450
- Well?

13
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.850
- Where did you get that sword?

14
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.890
- From a Frenchman
named de Coligny.


15
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.530
It belongs to his family.

16
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.770
- Why are they selling it?

17
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.330
- Because they need the money.
Everybody needs money.


18
00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.610
You know that. I know that.

19
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.170
- But shouldn't he be taking it
to a museum?


20
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.330
- He has to
do it on the sly.

21
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.330
His uncle and his mother
don't want him to sell it.


22
00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:12.570
They would stop him
if they could.


23
00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.690
- He probably has no right to sell it
without his mother's consent.


24
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.570
- His mother has nothing to say.

25
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.330
- What you going to do with it?

26
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.930
- I'm going to send it
to America.


27
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.610
- But... that's illegal.

28
00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.570
- I saw a dress in the window
of Jean Veron's today.


29
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.410
A sort of peach colour.

30
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.210
You might call it apricot.

31
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.530
It would suit you.

32
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.010
- Really?

33
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.930
- Oh, you don't think
I'm too pale?


34
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.650
- Oh, you can't take
strong colours.


35
00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.130
- You're probably right.
- No, except black.


36
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.850
I like you in black.
(laughing)


37
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.330
- My black crepe de Chine,
that's chic, isn't it?


38
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.410
- Mm. Makes you look
like a little nun.


39
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.210
We should get you
a white-lace collar to go with it.


40
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.850
(soft piano music playing)

41
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.290
- Ah, there you are, Anna.

42
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.410
- Lola's in the Select.
She'll be along in a minute.


43
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.290
(indistinct chatter)

44
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.810
I'm not in my assiette,
as the dear French say.


45
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.290
- Now,
what are we going to have?


46
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:33.370
- I've been trying to decide
who's worse: men or women.


47
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.450
- Well, are we ready to order?

48
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.090
- Women are worse. They'll kick your face
to bits if you let them.


49
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.810
- Oh, darling,
don't be depressed.


50
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.290
Have a fine.

51
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.690
H.J., do call Lefranc.
We are ready to order.


52
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.930
- Monsieur Lefranc.
(background chatter)


53
00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:56.690
- Did you see Cri-Cri
count me dead, H.J.?


54
00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.250
Considering she came to my party
last Saturday.


55
00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.290
- Oh, don't worry about her, my dear.
She's having her little hour.


56
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.050
- Till her painter
throws her out.


57
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.930
- She's a character.
She's a type.


58
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.890
They have their little hour,
then we hear no more about them.


59
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.930
- Mar ya.

60
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.490
- Hello.

61
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.050
- There's that little...
Zelli girl.


62
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.210
- Couldn't you turn up tomorrow?
I wish you would.


63
00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:24.650
I'd like to talk to you.

64
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.530
- I can't.
I have to meet my husband.


65
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.490
- Where did she come from?
Does anybody know?


66
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.730
- Somewhere rather vague
and exotic.


67
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.850
Martinique? Could that be right?

68
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.130
Anyway, her mother's
supposed to be a West Indian.


69
00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:38.370
- That means she's a Creole.

70
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.210
- What is a Creole?

71
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.490
- I thought it was a way of cooking chicken.
(nearby laughter)


72
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.730
- Oh, you know the Heidlers,
do you?


73
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:48.170
- Not very well.

74
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.290
- Keep it that way.
- Why?


75
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.290
If you have something to say,
I wish you'd say it.


76
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.170
- I'm not too clear
about the whole thing, but...


77
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.250
it seems there was a girl
who killed herself.


78
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.050
Someone Heidler
had had an affair with.


79
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.250
And then he had
some sort of breakdown,


80
00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:10.130
and his wife
had to take him away.


81
00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.770
To New York or somewhere.

82
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:15.050
I believe Mrs. 
Heidler paints.

83
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.450
It's pretty awful to think of
the hundreds of women round here


84
00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.010
painting away, isn't it?

85
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.210
- She's a decorative
little person.


86
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.570
You should get her
to sit for you, Lois.


87
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.530
(background chatter)

88
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.610
- What does he do?
- He's a very important man.


89
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.410
He makes discoveries.

90
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.610
He helps young people.

91
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.890
He has flair.

92
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.170
He also has money, of course.
And that helps.


93
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.450
- ...working their fingers
to the bone for him,


94
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:44.810
he doesn't have to do a thing;

95
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.250
he doesn't have to pay
for servants.


96
00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.370
(French chatter)

97
00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.650
- I hate all that kind of thing.
Astral bodies and all the rest of it.


98
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.210
- Astral bodies is theosophy.
- You've been neglecting us.


99
00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.170
You want to avoid English people
in Paris.


100
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.410
H.J. and I most completely agree
with you.


101
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.770
If you see only Anglo-Americans
in Paris,


102
00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.210
what's the use of being here
at all?


103
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.570
Oh, your husband's French,
of course.


104
00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.090
- He's a Pole.

105
00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.570
- And he, uh...
- He's an art dealer.


106
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.170
He acts between Frenchmen
who want to sell and foreigners.


107
00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.650
It's usually foreigners
who want to buy.


108
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.730
- And what do the Frenchmen
want to sell?


109
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:37.250
- Pictures, fur coats...

110
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:39.930
Madame Dubarry's prie-dieu.

111
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.130
Anything.

112
00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.050
-H.J.and I
have quite made up our minds


113
00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:46.050
that eating is the greatest
pleasure in life.


114
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.810
Haven't we, H.J.?

115
00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:49.610
Well, I mean, it is, isn't it?

116
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.810
It's one of the few pleasures
that never let you down.


117
00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.490
- Oh, the music.
(indistinct chatter)


118
00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:58.050
- What about sex?
I mean, really. What about sex?


119
00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:00.690
(indistinct chatter)

120
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.290
Well, are you forgetting about the sex?
- What?


121
00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.290
- He... he didn't say anything?

122
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.610
(soft piano music)

123
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.050
(indistinct chatter)

124
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.570
- I see that the Zelli girl's husband...
been sentenced.


125
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.490
One year, to be followed
by expulsion from France.


126
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:10.770
In other words, theft.

127
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.090
- Ah, I feel sorry for her,
all the same.


128
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.930
I can just see how it happened.

129
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.410
People do get hold
of girls like that.


130
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:21.810
- We should do something
for her.


131
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.530
- Poor little devil.

132
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.930
What did you have in mind?

133
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.050
- We could have her
in the spare room.


134
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:34.570
She probably hasn't got a bean.

135
00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.690
- Huh. But... we don't know
anything about her.


136
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.930
We don't even know
where she's from.


137
00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.170
People say she was born
in the West Indies, Martinique,


138
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.930
or some place like that.

139
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.410
- Is that supposed to be good,
or bad?


140
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.650
- I'm not saying it's either.
I'm merely stating a fact.


141
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.730
We don't know anything
about her,


142
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.850
except that her husband
is in jail.


143
00:13:58.090 --> 00:13:59.490
It's true.

144
00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.490
- I'm not going to have a discussion
on that sort of level.


145
00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.570
- I think you're getting bored
again.


146
00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:12.930
That's the reason you're ready
to bring in anybody at any cost.


147
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.970
- You just want to shut me off and shut me in,
make me into a tame husband.


148
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:19.970
- As if anyone could do that.
- I won't live like that.


149
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.850
- It's no use doing too much
for people, H...


150
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.330
It's simply no use
doing too much for people.


151
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.050
You know that, H.J.

152
00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:52.210
- All we've ever done for anyone
is to have them in the spare room.


153
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.330
- And look what trouble
they brought with them.


154
00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:56.770
All those types
we tried to be kind to.


155
00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:00.410
- I'm not interested in being kind
to anyone. I'm interested in them.


156
00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:03.010
In character.

157
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.370
In forms of life.

158
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:09.610
You should've married
a stockbroker


159
00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.410
and stayed with him
in South Kensington.


160
00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.130
- That is unfair. H.J.

161
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.410
You know perfectly well
I'm only thinking of you. I...


162
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:23.570
...I don't want us to get into
any more impossible situations.


163
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.170
- Don't you see
how dangerous it is to... to...


164
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:36.330
close oneself off?

165
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.170
Be afraid of...

166
00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.730
Well, just because of some...

167
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.330
...unpleasant experience
in the past?


168
00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.490
(birdsong)

169
00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.210
It's only a cubbyhole of a place,
but she'll be alright.


170
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:58.530
(coughing)

171
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.530
(coughing)

172
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.970
(loud background chatter)

173
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.970
- Hello, Mado.
- My poor boy.


174
00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.290
What rotten luck.

175
00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.290
- Mado, listen.

176
00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:15.170
The worst, th-the very worst,

177
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:17.330
is that this has happened
when I have no money.


178
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.530
What will you do?
I worry myself to death about you.


179
00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:22.210
- I'll manage something.

180
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.810
Tell me what happened exactly.
I'd rather know.


181
00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:30.770
- It's so stupid.

182
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.290
My defending lawyer
didn't know his métier.


183
00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.090
Instead of making a case...

184
00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.050
Instead of making a case,

185
00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.330
he told the court
how I speak six languages.


186
00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:45.610
Well... no luck.

187
00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.730
If only I had some money
for you.


188
00:18:51.170 --> 00:18:54.210
You must write at once to your family
to send you some money.


189
00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.530
Have you written yet?
- Yes.


190
00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.050
Mm... no.

191
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.250
I'll manage. I'm telling you.
- How?


192
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.850
- I will. Only, I have
such an awful cold, I can't think now.


193
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.250
This noise.

194
00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.650
- What will you do?!

195
00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.730
- Never mind.

196
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:14.930
As a matter of fact,

197
00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.290
some people asked me
to go and live with them.


198
00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:20.010
- Who? For godsakes, speak up!

199
00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.370
- The Heidlers. You don't know them.
They're English.


200
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.770
- It's alright, then.
You go and live with them.


201
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.290
- I don't want to.
- Listen.


202
00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.890
Do you want drive me mad?
They'll take care of you.


203
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.410
And I can have
some peace of mind about you.


204
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:35.570
- My darling, I love you.

205
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.610
You'll be out in spring.
The time will pass quickly.


206
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.610
- Quickly? My God, that's funny.
Quickly.


207
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.090
- I'll come to see you
every week.


208
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:51.850
And... in spring, we'll go away.

209
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:53.410
To...

210
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.930
to Berlin or Brussels.

211
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:59.570
- Promise you'll go and stay
with these people. Promise.


212
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:03.170
- Yes, yes. Yes.

213
00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.650
- Say something.
Quick, speak to me.


214
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:10.290
- I love you.

215
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.250
I do.

216
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:18.090
- Alright. And you go and live
with these English people.


217
00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.330
Good. Finally.

218
00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:24.930
My poor little Mado.

219
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.530
Are they nice?

220
00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.570
- Oh, yes.

221
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:31.890
Very nice.
(sniffling)


222
00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:34.970
- I won't be able to stand it.

223
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:26.090
- It's awfully good of you
to worry about me.


224
00:22:26.250 --> 00:22:28.090
- Oh, nonsense. Rubbish.

225
00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.810
We're your friends.

226
00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.890
- Of course we are.
- I do love your frock.


227
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.330
I shall paint you
with short black gloves on.


228
00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.250
Or - no,
she'll have short green gloves.


229
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.090
What do you think, H.J.?

230
00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:43.170
- Do show her the room.

231
00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.690
- So here we are.

232
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:59.970
- You are very kind, you know,
but--


233
00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:02.490
- Oh, if you mean you're afraid
of being a bother,


234
00:23:02.610 --> 00:23:04.330
put that right out of your head.

235
00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:06.250
I'm used to it.

236
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:09.450
H.J. is always rescuing
some young genius or the other


237
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:10.850
and installing them in here.

238
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:13.410
- I really haven't got any money
at all.


239
00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.770
I feel I ought to do something
about it.


240
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.370
- Well, what...
what will you do?


241
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.250
- I used to be on the stage,
just sort in the chorus,


242
00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.730
in England.

243
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:31.050
- You must let us
take care of you.


244
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:32.490
I want it.

245
00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.130
H.J. wants it.

246
00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:42.050
I shall be awfully disappointed,
and hurt, if you don't let me.


247
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.770
I know what it is.

248
00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:48.050
I love H.J. so terribly, but...

249
00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:53.050
...he isn't always awfully nice
to me.


250
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:56.970
- It's just so difficult for me
to trust anyone.


251
00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.330
- Well, naturally, with the life you've led
and your marriage.


252
00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.770
- I didn't mean my marriage.
Not Stephan.


253
00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:06.970
- Y-you mustn't think
I don't see the...


254
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:09.650
the angle that you look
at life from.


255
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:11.690
Because I do.

256
00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:14.690
Please rest now.

257
00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.530
Do rest.
Don't let's talk anymore.


258
00:24:21.610 --> 00:24:25.290
- It really wasn't any use
talking to Lois about Stephan,


259
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.610
or how things were with me
when I met him.


260
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.770
Women like Lois,
who've always had money,


261
00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:35.330
just don't understand
what it's like for somebody like me,


262
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.850
who've never had any.

263
00:24:56.850 --> 00:24:58.810
(indistinct chatter)

264
00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.650
(French chatter)

265
00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.930
(operatic singing)

266
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.730
- Oh, I'm sorry!

267
00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.530
- I wasn't looking.
- Oh, you speak English.


268
00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:15.530
Very good.

269
00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:17.450
Very nice.

270
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.690
Uh... I...

271
00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.450
I understand perfectly.

272
00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:23.810
You'd just come down
from the second floor.


273
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:26.850
M. Gauthier, impresario.
And there was no job.


274
00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:29.170
And you're feeling rotten.
- Yes.


275
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:32.090
- But I... I'm going up
to the third floor,


276
00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.450
in hope and joy,
to M. Perron et Dussolier,


277
00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.130
art dealers, auctioneers,
with this precious object,


278
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.050
which you nearly--
- What is it?


279
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.050
- Voila.

280
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.090
Yes, to you,
an ordinary rocking horse,


281
00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:53.850
but do you know who sat on it?

282
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:58.330
One of Swinburne's children.
The great English poet.


283
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:02.090
- He didn't have any children.
- Uh, then it was Millet,


284
00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:03.930
the great English painter.

285
00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.090
He had many children.

286
00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:09.010
Please, don't deny me again.

287
00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:11.970
I've set all my hopes...

288
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.770
on this little horse.

289
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:17.210
- Stephan, Stephan.

290
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:50.770
(bell tolling)

291
00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.130
- That's right, she likes it.

292
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:08.730
(clanging)

293
00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.650
(Lois): Do you intend
to keep going there?


294
00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.290
- To see Stephan? Yes.

295
00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.530
- Well... we don't approve.

296
00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.490
You know, lots of girls
make extraordinary marriages.


297
00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.410
You know,
for all sorts of reasons.


298
00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:42.290
But the time comes
when you must cut loose.


299
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:45.610
Can't you see that?

300
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.050
- No, I can't.

301
00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.690
- Tsk.
You're a very tiresome child.


302
00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.970
You'll be alright.

303
00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.690
You'll row your little boat along,

304
00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:58.530
but if you try to help
your husband, you are done.


305
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:02.010
(sighing)
I hate myself made up.


306
00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.010
I don't think it's my genre.

307
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.210
But H.J. likes it.

308
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.690
And I always give way to H.J.

309
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.290
I give him what he wants -
till his mood changes.


310
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:15.610
- Will you lend me 100 francs?

311
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.050
If I had 100 francs,
I could leave.


312
00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.370
- Well... why on earth
should you want to leave?


313
00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.330
- You'll never have to see me
again.


314
00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.930
- We are making a great deal of fuss
about nothing at all, aren't we?


315
00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:39.290
Drama is catching, I find.

316
00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:44.050
Don't let H.J. hear you,
or he'll be very cross.


317
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:45.570
With both of us.

318
00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:47.810
- You ought to do it often.

319
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:49.930
(chuckling)
- Do you think so?


320
00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:55.410
- Don't rush off.

321
00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:05.770
Oh, God, I get so utterly sick
of myself sometimes.


322
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.570
(sniffing)

323
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.930
Do you ever get sick
of yourself?


324
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.970
- No.
- Well, I get sick of myself.


325
00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:26.490
(honking)

326
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.410

329
00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.010
Don't bother with coats...

330
00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.650
- Ah, bonsoir, monsieur.
(indistinct chatter)


331
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:43.050
Pardon.

Where have you been?

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:26.250
- Oh, I've been hiding
in the fog.


357
00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:28.090
I didn't think anyone
would want to see me.

(indistinct chatter)

359
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:38.290
- What is it?
(sniffing)


360
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:41.730
- Oh, look.
- Oh, yes!


361
00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:45.090
- Would you like to try?
I can drink whatever I like,


362
00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:48.010
and pull myself together
in a second with that.


363
00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:51.170
Break it. Sniff it up.

364
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.130
- Oh.

365
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:54.690
- Oh, my dear,
it was in all the newspapers.


366
00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:56.730
(voices distorting)

367
00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:11.930
- What's this rubbish
we've got here?


368
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:14.410
(indistinct chatter)

369
00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:24.410
- What are you trying to do?

370
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:27.570
(whispering)

371
00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:29.530
Heidler doesn't like me talking to you.

372
00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:32.770
- Why shouldn't he?
You're imagining it.


373
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:35.810
He's very kind.

374
00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:37.250
- Kind?

375
00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:39.570
Heidler kind?

376
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.530
My God.

377
00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.770
- I can't stand that self-righteous American
Cairn fellow


378
00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:48.570
Mar ya keeps on seeing.

379
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.130
I wonder if she's alright.

380
00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.130
You're such a fool, Guy.

381
00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:00.010
- Don't shout in my ear.

382
00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.850
- Well, get out of the way.
Blocking up the bar.


383
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:03.490
- It's my bar.

384
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:05.450
- Then you ought to give
your clients a chance.


385
00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:08.050
Come, my dear.
You alright?


386
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:21.890
- French people pretend
just as much as anybody else.


387
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:24.010
Ha. Maybe they pretend
about different things.


388
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:26.650
Maybe not quite so obvious,
but they all pretend.


389
00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:28.290
(Lois chuckling)
You'll find that out, dear,


390
00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:30.330
when you've been here
as long as I have.


391
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:31.850
- Sure. Excuse me.

392
00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.770
- You see, Michel,
men feel disgusted by what they do,


393
00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:41.010
and so they drink,
they take drugs,


394
00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:42.730
and they're forever changing
partners.


395
00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.770
- What about women?
- Oh, that's quite different.


396
00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:46.730
They can stay happy
with each other


397
00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:48.850
because they only do
what is beautiful.


398
00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:50.530
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

399
00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:56.170
- They're like members of a harem
who can't get on.


400
00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.130
- It'll all blow over, no doubt.

401
00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.810
- He doesn't know himself.
That's what's so frightening.


402
00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:10.930
He doesn't know his own nature.
(sniffling)


403
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.090
I suppose it's a sort
of innocence in him, really.


404
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:17.890
(people cheering)
Oh, God, this damn thing hurts my head.


405
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.290
- Do you know why your door
is open every morning?


406
00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:26.810
Come over here,
listen to what I have to say.


407
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.250
Must you do that? When I'm alone
with you for five minutes,


408
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:35.330
you paint your mouth
or perform some other monkey trick.


409
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:38.810
Your door is open,
because I come up at night,


410
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.730
I look at you,
and then I go away again.


411
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:44.810
Don't you know I've wanted you
from the first moment I saw you?


412
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.250
Well, I kept off you, didn't I?

413
00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:50.930
I knew I could have you
by putting my hands on you,


414
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:52.570
but I kept off you.

415
00:37:53.410 --> 00:37:55.330
I thought it wouldn't be playing
the game, you see,


416
00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:56.970
but there comes a limit.

417
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.890
I watched you tonight
and now I know


418
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.050
that somebody else will get you
if I don't. You're that sort.


419
00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.050
- You're abominably rude
and stupid.


420
00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:06.850
You have no idea
how other people feel.


421
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:09.410
- You think I don't know
how you feel?


422
00:38:11.770 --> 00:38:14.610
- It's odd, the way he always
picks out the same kind of girl.


423
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:16.850
The crushed-petal type.

424
00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.650
- This one's quite tough.
- Mm-hmm.


425
00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:24.450
- But they tend to wear the same kind
of little-girl's frocks.


426
00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.690
You know...
You know, and the other one...


427
00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:31.930
...when she died...

428
00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.730
...I cleared out the spare room.
I got rid of all her things,


429
00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.610
except this one
pathetic little frock.


430
00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:41.370
It was the one I painted her in.
God knows why I kept it.


431
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.850
I pushed it out of sight
up on a shelf.


432
00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:48.570
Somehow I...

433
00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.330
I just couldn't bring myself
to throw it away.


434
00:38:51.450 --> 00:38:52.930
It... it seemed...

435
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:56.050
It was too like a person.
It was like her.


436
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:59.610
I found it the other day

437
00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:01.610
when I went to get
the room ready for Mar ya.


438
00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:04.290
Oh, God.

439
00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:07.370
Just to touch it
made me feel sick.


440
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.170
I hid it before H.J. came in.

441
00:39:12.330 --> 00:39:14.450
God knows why I didn't burn it.

442
00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:17.290
Bad enough I had to see it.

443
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.850
No need for him
to go over all that again.


444
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:23.650
- You take very good care
of him.


445
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:26.810
- She'll take care of herself.

446
00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:28.850
I'm there to take care of him.

447
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.610
That's what he depends on,
that in the end I'll pull him through.


448
00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:37.730
- What about Lois?

449
00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:40.850
- My dear, you simply
don't understand Lois at all.


450
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:42.650
You are a funny little thing.

451
00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.810
Why, look here. Do you know
what she said about you?


452
00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:48.610
I tell you this because I...
I want you to realize


453
00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:53.010
that Lois simply doesn't come into this at all
between you and me.


454
00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:57.170
She said, "The matter with Mado
is she's too virtuous."


455
00:39:57.850 --> 00:40:00.810
There. That's what she thinks
about the situation.


456
00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:02.930
- Ah, there you are.

457
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.370
- Come on.

458
00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:12.930
- Miss Mar ya?

459
00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:17.450
- You don't know anything about him,
what he's like, or anything.


460
00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:19.690
- Oh, what is he like?
(cheering and applause)


461
00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:24.970
- I detest all this self-restraint we're all
supposed to be exercising all the time.


462
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.530
I'm sick of it.
One might as well be dead.


463
00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:30.890
One is dead.

464
00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.730
- He's right, huh? I haven't got
any money myself, as you know.


465
00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:43.010
But I'll borrow some for you.
I'll borrow 500 francs.


466
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:45.370
It's not a whole lot,
but at least that way,


467
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.130
you can live for a while at the Dome
on coffee and croissants.


468
00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:49.770
- I don't need money.

469
00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:51.850
- Heidler is a humbug.

470
00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:54.730
And God help you
if you don't see that.


471
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:59.530
J I need a good time huggin' &

472
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:04.330
<i>3 Good time kissin' man &</i>

473
00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:08.610
J Don't want a part-time lover &

474
00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:12.330
J Want a good time huggin' J

475
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:16.810
J Full-time lover man &

476
00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:31.130
Kisses. Kisses for you?

477
00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:37.610
Ah, drink, drink, drink.

478
00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:44.930
- What are you doing
out here in the cold?


479
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:48.690
We're looking for you.
Lois is very worried about you. Come.


480
00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:51.810
- Will you lunch with me again on Tuesday?
- Tuesday.


481
00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:57.290
(piano music continues)

482
00:42:04.530 --> 00:42:07.570
- There's something not right about Cairn.
I can't put my finger on it,


483
00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:09.650
but I don't think
he's the sort of person


484
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.210
you ought to know,
quite frankly.


485
00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:13.610
I'd like it
if you didn't see him again.


486
00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:16.810
Look, we don't have to stay here
if you don't want to.


487
00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:18.770
- I want to.
- Why?


488
00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:22.010
They're an abominable lot
of people.


489
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.890
It's just scruff.

490
00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.450
- You don't know what it is
to want to be like other people


491
00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:28.210
and have a good time
and be happy.


492
00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:30.810
- Why are you drinking that?
You're drunk already.


493
00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.450
- It makes me feel wonderful.

494
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.850
- I love you so much,
I wish I were dead.


495
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:38.330
Be nice to me.

496
00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:43.050
I'll make you happy.
That's what I'm here for.


497
00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:48.890

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:30.930
(applause and cheering)

508
00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.730
- Do you think I'm mad?

509
00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.170
Possessed?

510
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:12.570
(groaning)

511
00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:14.250
- Shhh.

512
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:08.730
- Go away.

513
00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.410
- I want to comfort you.

514
00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.170
- I'm so scared.
- I want to hold you safe and tight.


515
00:45:14.290 --> 00:45:16.530
- I'm so scared of being happy.

516
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:18.970
- There. There now. You're--

517
00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:21.010
- I can't stand anymore.
- You're excitable.


518
00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:23.970
You'll tear yourself to bits.
I'm holding you safe.


519
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:25.690
Safe and tight.

520
00:45:26.650 --> 00:45:29.250
(whispering)
Yes.


521
00:45:29.970 --> 00:45:32.370
(Mar ya whimpering)
Wh-wh-what are you saying?


522
00:45:32.490 --> 00:45:34.530
- You don't understand.
- Oh, yes, I do.


523
00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:37.210
I do, my dear, I do. I do.

524
00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:39.970
(birdsong)

525
00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:14.290
Ah.

526
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.370
(background chatter)

527
00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:32.410
- And, uh, what about the job
with the modiste?


528
00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:35.490
- They wanted to see
my work permit.


529
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:36.970
- Same old story.

530
00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:39.290
What it is to be foreigner
in Paris.


531
00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:45.330
You will be able to come,
won't you, next Sunday?


532
00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:48.210
I mean, it's not too much
trouble for you, is it?


533
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:51.650
- It's only half an hour
on the tram. I told you.


534
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:53.370
It's nothing.

535
00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:55.610
- Perhaps it's true, then.

536
00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:57.930
You do care for me.

537
00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:00.930
- I love you.

538
00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:03.530
I'm waiting.

539
00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.970
- You went to the prison again
today, didn't you?


540
00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.410
(clucking tongue)

541
00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:58.050
You can't go to those places and...

542
00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.970
come home and expect everything
to be alright.


543
00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:07.090
- Lois? I want to leave.

544
00:48:08.490 --> 00:48:09.770
The sooner, the better.

545
00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:13.330
- Don't be silly, Mado.

546
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.690
You know that I'm pulling
every string I can to fix you up.


547
00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:19.610
So is H.J.

548
00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:24.770
I'm almost sure I can get you
a mannequin job in about a month or six weeks


549
00:48:24.930 --> 00:48:27.210
with... what's his name
on the Rue Royale?


550
00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:29.610
I don't believe
in forcing things.


551
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:31.410
I believe in letting them alone.

552
00:48:31.530 --> 00:48:33.250
And I hate scenes.

553
00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:35.650
Of course you can't go.

554
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:40.330
- The stupid thing is,
I really can't,


555
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:42.730
unless you lend me some money.

556
00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:44.970
- Could you move your head
a bit?


557
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:47.330
No, to... to the left.

558
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:42.370
- The only thing I can think about
is not getting paid!


559
00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:44.130
It inhibits my performance.

560
00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:00.010
- We must get Mado another hat, H.J.

561
00:53:00.130 --> 00:53:02.890
She must be chic.
She must do us credit.


562
00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:05.530
Is she coming to the country
this weekend?


563
00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:09.090
Oh, no. No,
she's going to the prison again.


564
00:53:09.730 --> 00:53:11.490
You must stop her, H.J.

565
00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:15.690
Ah, aren't they pathetic?

566
00:53:15.810 --> 00:53:18.130
They really look as if
they could do with a good meal.


567
00:53:18.810 --> 00:53:20.490
Not to speak of a bath.

568
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:25.490
You wouldn't care to have them
in the spare room, would you, H.J.?


569
00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:39.690
Do sit down, darling.
I can't see a thing.


570
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:44.930
- I may be young and innocent...

571
00:53:45.850 --> 00:53:47.730
...but I know a hussy
when I see one.


572
00:53:48.370 --> 00:53:50.410
- Darling Mar ya!

573
00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:53.290
Ah, really, Guy,
you don't know her very well.


574
00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:56.290
She's a sweet, young thing,
on the sentimental side.


575
00:53:56.410 --> 00:53:57.970
- You go away, Guy!

576
00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:00.090
- He wasn't doing anything.

577
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:02.450
He's just a little pink-eyed,
aren't you, darling?


578
00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:04.090
I like your scarf.

579
00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:05.850
Very dashing.

580
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:09.290
- It's Hugo's. It's the only thing
he left behind when he ran off.


581
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:11.650
- I expect you to come
to the country this weekend.


582
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:14.890
- You know I have
to see Stephan next Sunday.


583
00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:18.130
- Must we have all that again?
- Let's go to Luna Park.


584
00:54:18.250 --> 00:54:20.250
We'll put Mado on the joy wheel

585
00:54:20.410 --> 00:54:21.810
and watch her
being banged about a bit.


586
00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:24.890
Well, she ought to amuse us
sometimes.


587
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:26.370
She ought to sing
for her supper.


588
00:54:26.490 --> 00:54:28.970
That's what she's here for,
after all, isn't it?


589
00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:31.890
Well, shall we go to Luna Park?

590
00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:34.210
- No, I don't think so.

591
00:54:36.050 --> 00:54:38.570
- I'm bored to death
with Montparnasse!


592
00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:41.370
Bored, bored... bored!

593
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:44.730
Well, let's go
to a proper musical.


594
00:54:44.850 --> 00:54:47.970
That's what I feel like.
Something really low-life.


595
00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:50.650
- What?
- You'd like that, wouldn't you, Mar ya?


596
00:54:50.770 --> 00:54:52.610
Something really canaille?

597
00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:21.650
- You're coming to Brunoy
on Saturday, aren't you?


598
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:23.850
What's the matter?

599
00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:25.170
- Nothing.

600
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:27.290
- Can't you come?
Just to please me.


601
00:55:28.450 --> 00:55:30.890
Can't you not go to the prison
just for once?


602
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:44.450
(indistinct chatter)

603
00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:50.850
- Do you think I'm the maid
to be made love to...


604
00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:53.490
every time
the mistress's back is turned?


605
00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:00.290
(birdsong)

606
00:57:01.650 --> 00:57:03.410
(dog whining)

607
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:06.530
(gunfire)

608
00:57:08.730 --> 00:57:10.570
(barking)

609
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:31.650
(indistinct chatter)

610
00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:37.090
H.J., I can't go on with this.

611
00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:39.650
It isn't my line at all.

612
00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.010
- But that's not playing
the game, is it?


613
00:57:43.530 --> 00:57:44.730
Not any sort of game.

614
00:57:44.850 --> 00:57:47.810
- What game? Your game?
Lois's game?


615
00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:50.370
Why should I be playing
Lois's game?


616
00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:53.890
- I must tell you that
you misunderstand Lois utterly.


617
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:56.610
You will persist in judging us

618
00:57:56.730 --> 00:57:58.450
by the standards of the awful life
you've lived.


619
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:02.170
Can't you see
you're in a different world now?


620
00:58:04.170 --> 00:58:07.570
You're not going to be let down.
You're with friends.


621
00:58:10.690 --> 00:58:12.610
Now what's she doing there?
What's keeping her?


622
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:17.970
My dear, must we have
this conversation now?


623
00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:20.570
Lois doesn't want
to be given away.


624
00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:22.370
She just doesn't want
anybody to know.


625
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:26.130
And I assure you,
that is all she cares about.


626
00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:30.130
(bell tolling)
- I see.


627
00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:24.650
(indistinct chatter)

628
00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:29.410
(Lois): Why don't you take Mar ya?
They'll be some company for you.


629
00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:32.410
(H.J.): She may refuse.
You know how she is.


630
00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:34.570
- Yes, she is terribly surly.

631
00:59:35.170 --> 00:59:37.250
She's very embarrassing
sometimes,


632
00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:39.210
you know,
when there are people.


633
00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.010
You ought to tell her.

634
00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:42.810
- Don't forget her background.

635
00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:46.290
- You mustn't think
that I don't know


636
00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:49.570
the arrangement that you two
have made about me!


637
00:59:50.610 --> 00:59:53.610
- You're mad.
- You've made an arrangement:


638
00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:55.730
If he wants the woman,
let him have her.


639
00:59:55.850 --> 00:59:57.410
Do you think I don't know?!

640
00:59:58.330 --> 00:59:59.730
- Don't shout.

641
00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:01.490
They can hear every
single word next door.


642
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:05.410
(shouting)
- No, no, let me talk to her!


643
01:00:05.530 --> 01:00:07.690
You don't understand how to deal
with a woman of this sort. I do.


644
01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:09.490
- Look out, Heidler,
I'll kill you!


645
01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:11.490
- You're hysterical!
Talk calmly.


646
01:00:11.610 --> 01:00:14.130
- I am not going to live
with Lois and you any longer!


647
01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:15.130
I am not!

648
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:17.450
- What's this all about?
What do you want? Money?


649
01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:19.730
- Swine!!! Incredible swine!!!

650
01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.850
(grunting)
Let me get at him again!


651
01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:26.250
- You're right, you're right!
Oh, God. Oh, God.


652
01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:29.650
Leave me alone!
I'm done with you!


653
01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:31.770
- Oh, H.J., my dearest--
- Damn you! Leave me alone!


654
01:00:37.970 --> 01:00:40.530
- Hadn't you better
get back to bed, Mar ya?


655
01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:45.290
- I'm going to bed.
I'm very drunk.


656
01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:50.170
I shan't remember anything at all
about this in the morning.


657
01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:59.530
- He always does that.
When there's been a scene,


658
01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:01.370
he always says next morning

659
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:03.330
that he was too drunk
to remember anything.


660
01:01:03.450 --> 01:01:05.210
It's his way
of getting out of things.


661
01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:10.690
I say, you're not going to talk
to anybody in Paris...


662
01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:12.450
about this, are you?

663
01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:14.930
- Is that all
you're worried about?


664
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.890
- Yes... as a matter of fact.

665
01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:44.090
- Shall I send Lois away?
I'll do anything you want.


666
01:01:44.850 --> 01:01:48.330
If you're not happy with us,
I'll find somewhere else for you.


667
01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:50.890
There now. Be quiet now.

668
01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:52.890
It's all going to be alright.

669
01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:55.090
I'll break with her.

670
01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:57.170
I'll take you away somewhere.
Is that what you want?


671
01:01:57.290 --> 01:01:59.130
- No.
- I'll take a hotel room for you.


672
01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:00.810
We'll have a place of our own.

673
01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:03.250
Don't worry.

674
01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:08.290
- H.J.? I'm coming up.

675
01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:11.770
- H.J., be good to Lois.
You must be good to Lois.


676
01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:14.450
- I shouldn't worry too much
about Lois if I were you.


677
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:18.770
I don't intend to let you go.

678
01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:21.530
Make no mistake about that.

679
01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:54.130
(crying)

680
01:02:54.250 --> 01:02:56.490
(sobbing)

681
01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:02.130
Get up at once.

682
01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:05.970
Please. Get up.

683
01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:09.650
I can't stand this.
I won't tolerate this.


684
01:03:09.770 --> 01:03:13.090
(Lois sobbing)
Lois, please, please. Get up.


685
01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:16.330
(sniffling and sobbing)

686
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:18.210
Now, now, now.

687
01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:19.890
Go and wash your face.

688
01:03:26.770 --> 01:03:28.290
Please.

689
01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:29.770
Here, here, here.

690
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:40.930
Please.

691
01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:44.010
Please.

692
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:48.530
(background chatter)
- You left those people?


693
01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:51.210
Really, you must be mad.

694
01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:52.730
Where are you now?

695
01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:54.610
- In a hotel.

696
01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:58.610
What's it matter where I am?
I'm waiting for you.


697
01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:00.850
- And when I am free,
I'll have no money.


698
01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:02.090
I will have to leave France.

699
01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:03.770
You have friends
and you lose them.


700
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:05.410
It's not so funny, you know!

701
01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:06.970
- Don't quarrel with me.

702
01:04:11.770 --> 01:04:14.090
- Forgive me. I'm, uh...

703
01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:16.050
I'm going off my head in here.

704
01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:21.650
Last Sunday,
when you didn't come--


705
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:23.490
- No, don't.

706
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.370
- You couldn't help it.
You were ll.


707
01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:28.170
- Yes.

708
01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:30.970
(metal rattling)
(French chatter)


709
01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:37.770
- Every number they called,
I thought it was mine.


710
01:04:38.010 --> 01:04:40.370
I was glad when the time was up,
I can tell you.


711
01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:45.970
You go mad, shut away in here.

712
01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:49.690
- I never will not turn up
again, Stephan.


713
01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:52.410
So don't worry.

714
01:05:08.330 --> 01:05:11.290
- I'm not late.
Your clock is fast.


715
01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:16.370
- What happened
the day before yesterday?


716
01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:17.890
And Saturday.

717
01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:25.050
One week.

718
01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:27.890
I haven't seen you for one week.

719
01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:11.050
- Open your eyes, savage.

720
01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:16.410
- I feel as if I'd fallen down
a precipice.


721
01:06:16.530 --> 01:06:17.970
(H.J. chuckling)

722
01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:19.690
- You funny thing.

723
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:22.210
- Please.
- Hmm?


724
01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:23.570
- Be nice with me.

725
01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:25.530
I love you so.

726
01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:27.890
- There. There.

727
01:06:29.170 --> 01:06:31.450
There. You're such a darling...

728
01:06:32.810 --> 01:06:33.850
...pretty little thing.

729
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:37.450
Such a funny,
pretty little thing.


730
01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:43.410
I say, did you notice what I did
with my wristwatch?


731
01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:52.810
(sighing)

732
01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:59.130
Lois has got hold
of two Hungarians for tonight.


733
01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:02.090
I promised I'd turn up.

734
01:07:02.970 --> 01:07:06.530
Lois asked me to meet that young
American guy, what's-his-name...


735
01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:09.250
Sculptor.

736
01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:12.850
Are you alright for money?

737
01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:17.250
Better leave you some money and,
uh...


738
01:07:22.570 --> 01:07:24.930
Whew. Say,
it's frightfully hot in here. Ahem.


739
01:07:26.970 --> 01:07:30.170
Mind if I open the window?
Get some air in.


740
01:07:32.490 --> 01:07:34.490
(window rattling)
Ah. It's better.


741
01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:36.690
Now, where's your handbag, hmm?

742
01:07:41.010 --> 01:07:42.090
Now, look here.

743
01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:46.410
Do go and dine somewhere decent,
for godsake. Hmm?


744
01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:50.570
Lois is expecting you
on Saturday. You know that.


745
01:07:50.690 --> 01:07:53.010
- Oh, she is, is she?
- She certainly is.


746
01:07:53.130 --> 01:07:54.330
And so am I.

747
01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:57.810
- Why should I be a butt
for Lois and her friends?


748
01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:00.730
She wants me there
so she can talk at me,


749
01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:02.490
so she can watch
for the right moment


750
01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:04.010
to put her enormous foot down!

751
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:06.970
- You talk the most awful
nonsense sometimes, don't you?


752
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:09.770
- Aren't Lois's feet enormous?

753
01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:11.850
Huge, big feet like puddles?

754
01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:13.730
(laughing)

755
01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:19.770
Alright, I'll come.

756
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:23.770
What's it matter, anyway?

757
01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:32.610
- I hate
having to explain things.


758
01:08:35.610 --> 01:08:37.330
I hate having to talk
about things.


759
01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:41.850
Surely you must see
that you can't let Lois down.


760
01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:44.650
- What about letting me down?

761
01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:48.290
- We must keep up appearances.

762
01:08:49.490 --> 01:08:51.210
We must play the game.

763
01:08:53.530 --> 01:08:54.730
Savage.

764
01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:58.090
Bolshevist.

765
01:08:59.690 --> 01:09:02.210
You'll end up in Red Russia.
That's what'll happen to you.


766
01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:06.690
- It's horrible when someone
has no self-control,


767
01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:09.090
the consequences
for everyone else around.


768
01:09:09.210 --> 01:09:10.250
- She was pretty.

769
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:12.250
- Mm. She tried to kill herself
at least twice.


770
01:09:12.370 --> 01:09:14.730
And that was ages
before we even knew her.


771
01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:16.450
Once,
she tried to cut her throat.


772
01:09:17.130 --> 01:09:20.450
I didn't put the scar in, of course,
but one could distinctly see it.


773
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:24.370
(French chatter)

774
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.690
(bell tolling)

775
01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:39.490
"It's as if all the blood
in my body


776
01:10:39.610 --> 01:10:42.410
is being drained very slowly,

777
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:44.130
all the time.

778
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:46.530
All the blood in my heart.

779
01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:50.330
What can I say
to make you believe me?"


780
01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:53.210
- You're right, of course.

781
01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:57.010
It's my fault
for getting involved


782
01:10:57.130 --> 01:10:58.650
with these neurasthenics.

783
01:11:01.930 --> 01:11:04.130
But it's not I
who seek them out.


784
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:06.970
They who find me.

785
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:28.250
It's as if they sensed
a weakness in me that...


786
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:31.370
...they fasten onto.

787
01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:12.610
- Ah, Mar ya! Hello, my dear.

788
01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:15.130
Now, you just pop upstairs,
put on something warm,


789
01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:17.410
we'll go out
and have a lovely day together, huh?


790
01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:18.730
- Who sent you?

791
01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:21.730
- Sent me?
I've come to take you out.


792
01:12:31.770 --> 01:12:33.650
(bird calls)

793
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:47.890
- Lois sent you, didn't she?

794
01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:54.330
- She thought you might be seedy
when she got your letter to them.


795
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.090
- My letter to them?

796
01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:01.890
- You did write to them,
didn't you, saying you were ill or something?


797
01:13:02.730 --> 01:13:04.690
- You mean she read my letter?

798
01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:07.290
My letter to H.J.?

799
01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:12.410
- I find...

800
01:13:13.330 --> 01:13:16.810
don't you, that married people
often have rather strange relationships?


801
01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:19.490
Everyone thinks they're on the point
of breaking up,


802
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:21.610
and then it turns out
they're thicker than ever.


803
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:24.450
Of course, you'd know
better than I do,


804
01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:26.010
being married yourself.

805
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:32.490
Lois...

806
01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:35.930
...Is a very rare person.

807
01:13:37.010 --> 01:13:38.810
I'm very, very fond of her.

808
01:13:40.570 --> 01:13:43.970
If I were to tell you everything
she's been through with him...


809
01:13:45.610 --> 01:13:48.810
I don't know why she puts up
with him, really. Do you?


810
01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:52.530
But that's the sort of person
she is.


811
01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:54.410
(clucking tongue)
Come on.


812
01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:01.130
Really, don't you think...

813
01:14:01.250 --> 01:14:04.850
Honestly, don't you think women
are truly superior beings?


814
01:14:06.330 --> 01:14:08.330
I only have to think
of my own parents.


815
01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:11.650
Father -
very charming and all that,


816
01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:14.010
but weak, shiftless.

817
01:14:14.690 --> 01:14:17.650
Oh, we children were on Mother's side.
Absolutely.


818
01:14:18.930 --> 01:14:21.090
I suppose that's made me
the way I am.


819
01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:27.370
I can't bear to see a woman
taken advantage of,


820
01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:31.370
whether it's you or Lois or...
whoever.


821
01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:35.810
What a beast.

822
01:14:42.690 --> 01:14:45.050
She's most extraordinarily fond
of you.


823
01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:47.890
She thinks about you,

824
01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:50.050
wants to help you.

825
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:55.490
Ah. Really fears...
for you sometimes.


826
01:14:56.610 --> 01:15:00.050
But I told her that basically
you're quite a sensible sort of person.


827
01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:02.810
You wouldn't
ever do anything silly.


828
01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:07.650
- So Lois has sent you
to make sure I don't kill myself,


829
01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:10.010
like the other girl.
(laughing)


830
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:12.970
- You mustn't get hysterical.

831
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:18.410
You really mustn't.

832
01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:34.850
(creaking)

833
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:40.850
(gong ringing)

834
01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:02.130
(dissonant music)

835
01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:04.090
(up-tempo music)

836
01:16:10.770 --> 01:16:14.090
- I didn't like those dark
circles around your eyes.


837
01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:15.290
(background chatter)

838
01:16:15.410 --> 01:16:18.010
I hope you haven't been
overdoing anything.


839
01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:20.890
- She was singing
an English parody!


840
01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:28.010
- ...French are like, sometimes.
- I hate people who try


841
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:31.090
to get by with nothing
but their sensitivity.


842
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:44.410
- Your sensitivity, what is it?

843
01:16:44.850 --> 01:16:48.810
Clergymen's daughters with long,
slim fingers and no money.


844
01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:52.650
- Don't worry.
They're getting killed off slowly.


845
01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:12.290
- I say, a riddle.

846
01:17:13.050 --> 01:17:15.730
Why is love like Rasputin?

847
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:25.170
- Why do you want money?
- Stephan is coming out next week.


848
01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:27.530
- If you go back
to your husband,


849
01:17:27.770 --> 01:17:29.730
I can't see you again.
You understand that?


850
01:17:30.450 --> 01:17:32.970
- Are you going to try and stop me,
you and your damned Lois?!


851
01:17:33.090 --> 01:17:34.610
- What... what's the matter?

852
01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:36.850
- She's getting worked up again.
Her husband's coming out.


853
01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:39.890
Your husband will be expelled
from France.


854
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:44.370
He'll go to Brussels and then
to Amsterdam, from pillar to post.


855
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:47.090
Then he'll try and get back to Paris,
where they'll arrest him again.


856
01:17:47.210 --> 01:17:49.530
Now, is that the sort of life
you want to share with him?


857
01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:51.250
- And what sort of life
do you think


858
01:17:51.370 --> 01:17:53.690
I'm going to share with you
and her?!


859
01:17:54.090 --> 01:17:56.090
- I'm not going
to have my party spoiled.


860
01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:02.170
- Were you trying
to borrow money from him?


861
01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:11.330
- Why don't you give it to me?
You should want to.


862
01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:16.410
- Well, H.J. calls the shots,
you know.


863
01:18:21.170 --> 01:18:25.570
- Why is love... like Rasputin?

864
01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:30.490
Why is love... like Rasputin?

865
01:18:30.650 --> 01:18:32.290
- I haven't the faintest idea.

866
01:18:33.010 --> 01:18:35.730
- Because... you can...

867
01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:38.970
...poison it...

868
01:18:39.690 --> 01:18:41.290
and you can...

869
01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:43.050
stab it!

870
01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:44.490
And you can...

871
01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:46.810
knock it down in the mud...

872
01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:50.170
...and it will always
get up again.


873
01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:51.370
- Ha!

874
01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:53.850
- Well, don't you think
that's good?


875
01:18:54.770 --> 01:18:56.450
Don't you think that's funny?

876
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:01.690
Love will not die.

877
01:19:03.450 --> 01:19:05.010
It simply will not die.

878
01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:08.850
Just like Rasputin.

879
01:19:23.890 --> 01:19:25.650
(birdsong)

880
01:19:34.490 --> 01:19:36.290
- Why is your hair so long?

881
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:39.650
- The barber there always lets
people grow it before they come out.


882
01:19:40.330 --> 01:19:41.650
Decent of him.

883
01:19:44.850 --> 01:19:47.410
A lot of the wardens
are quite decent types.


884
01:19:48.370 --> 01:19:49.850
They do their work.

885
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:52.090
I expect they'd prefer
to do something else.


886
01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:54.530
Now what do you wish?

887
01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:57.530
An éclair?

888
01:19:58.170 --> 01:19:59.770
Choux a la creme?

889
01:20:00.210 --> 01:20:02.530
Meringue? The ones you like!

890
01:20:03.250 --> 01:20:04.970
- But I can't eat
all those cakes.


891
01:20:05.090 --> 01:20:08.050
- But you must.
Mado, you don't look well.


892
01:20:09.130 --> 01:20:10.770
You haven't been eating
properly.


893
01:20:11.490 --> 01:20:13.570
You haven't been taking care
of yourself.


894
01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:14.890
Now, come on.

895
01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:23.450
I'll be able to stay four days
in Paris.


896
01:20:24.490 --> 01:20:28.450
A type I left Fresnes with this morning
may be able to lend me some money.


897
01:20:28.570 --> 01:20:30.530
Bernadet. Marcel Bernadet.

898
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:33.010
Lives with a girl in Montmartre.

899
01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:35.250
She was there to see him
this morning.


900
01:20:35.370 --> 01:20:38.290
A bit cold it seems,
but she's a good girl.


901
01:20:38.410 --> 01:20:41.770
Huh. She was so pleased
to see him, she cried.


902
01:20:41.890 --> 01:20:43.250
Ah.

903
01:20:44.690 --> 01:20:46.930
The fun of that man is women,
you know.


904
01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:50.130
You've got some cream
on your lip.


905
01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:58.410
I don't blame you.

906
01:21:02.770 --> 01:21:05.130
- Will you just be kind to me
for a little?


907
01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:12.850
- A year in jail doesn't make
a man appetizing, huh?


908
01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:16.610
(background chatter)

909
01:21:25.050 --> 01:21:27.770
- That'll be Schlamovitz
arguing with his lady friend.


910
01:21:28.690 --> 01:21:30.970
Still, it's nice of him
to let me stay here.


911
01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:34.210
He was in there with me.
Came out two weeks ago.


912
01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:37.970
Pierre.

913
01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:01.970
Pity.

914
01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:17.010
Transparent soaps.

915
01:22:27.690 --> 01:22:29.050
Skin food.

916
01:22:38.130 --> 01:22:39.690
A very good business.

917
01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:57.290
- I know a type who makes
a fortune every three years in the Argentine.


918
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:02.610
Then he comes to Paris
to spend it, the fool.


919
01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:05.250
My God. Paris.

920
01:23:22.690 --> 01:23:24.370
- Yes.

921
01:23:24.530 --> 01:23:27.890
Provided you turn your back on the towns
and go right out in the country.


922
01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:35.890
- But you can't ride.
- I can always learn.


923
01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:43.050
- Yes.

924
01:23:43.170 --> 01:23:45.730
In charge of accounts.
(woman laughing)


925
01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:49.530
- Do you think you could get
a job like that?


926
01:23:51.010 --> 01:23:52.410
- I need a haircut.

927
01:24:10.210 --> 01:24:12.770
- I met her one night
at the Moulin de la Galette.


928
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:15.450
She had nowhere to go,
so I brought her home.


929
01:24:26.610 --> 01:24:28.170
(man shouting)

930
01:24:41.090 --> 01:24:45.450
- Hmm.
You have very nice, soft hair, monsieur.


931
01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:49.810
I'm glad you don't use pomade.
Not like that one.


932
01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:52.450
Makes you sick,
so much pomade.


933
01:24:53.770 --> 01:24:56.130
- If I tell you he has to leave Paris
as quickly as possible,


934
01:24:56.290 --> 01:24:57.810
I say it for his sake.

935
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:03.730
A man thinks: I'm quite safe;

936
01:25:03.850 --> 01:25:06.010
nobody's bothering about me.

937
01:25:06.170 --> 01:25:10.090
He goes out and someone who knows him
sees him on the boulevard...


938
01:25:15.170 --> 01:25:17.610
- You've been very kind to him,
Mr. Schlamovitz.


939
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:19.610
Thank you.

940
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:28.010
We worked together
in the library there.


941
01:25:28.610 --> 01:25:30.370
They have some
very fascinating books.


942
01:25:30.530 --> 01:25:33.730
You would be surprised.
One can get an education


943
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:37.010
- I had a friend who went to Berlin
when he came out.


944
01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:39.810
He did very well there.

945
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:42.770
- I was thinking more
of Amsterdam.


946
01:25:43.050 --> 01:25:45.450
- Well, Amsterdam can be nice,
too.


947
01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:47.930
- I thought you were
so enchanted with Paris.


948
01:25:48.570 --> 01:25:52.610
- Well, every place can be nice
with a nice friend.


949
01:25:53.930 --> 01:25:55.290
(lively music playing)

950
01:25:55.410 --> 01:25:56.730
- They are late.

951
01:25:58.250 --> 01:26:00.130
Are we sure we want to do this?

952
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:03.090
My poor H.J.

953
01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:07.130
- I thought we decided that
we were going to see it through.


954
01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:21.050
- Don't let's go.
- But they're waiting for us.


955
01:26:21.730 --> 01:26:24.210
I don't care. I want to be able
to thank your friends.


956
01:26:24.970 --> 01:26:26.330
- I don't want to see them.

957
01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:28.530
I don't want them to see you.

958
01:26:28.930 --> 01:26:30.250
- Naturally not.

959
01:26:30.850 --> 01:26:32.650
- It's they
who are not good enough.


960
01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:36.210
- Stephan...

961
01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:39.610
...wherever you're going,
don't go without me.


962
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:43.730
- I only have just enough
for my own fare.


963
01:26:44.570 --> 01:26:47.730
- I'll borrow some money from the Heidlers,
and then I can go with you.


964
01:26:52.810 --> 01:26:55.130
Why not? Why not?

965
01:26:55.250 --> 01:26:57.090
- I must get away.

966
01:26:57.210 --> 01:26:58.970
I've lost my luck.

967
01:26:59.770 --> 01:27:02.450
- We always said we'd be together
when you came out.


968
01:27:03.410 --> 01:27:06.930
- You don't come out.
Nobody ever comes out.


969
01:27:19.410 --> 01:27:22.970
- For godsake, ask the waiter
for another fine. I'm so thirsty.


970
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:25.250
- Don't have brandy, Mado.
She oughtn't to drink brandy.


971
01:27:26.930 --> 01:27:29.050
- I'm afraid you must come.
- You're coming back with us, aren't you?


972
01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:30.850
We'll drop you off
at your hotel.


973
01:27:30.970 --> 01:27:32.450
- You're very kind, monsieur.
I'll take her home.


974
01:27:32.610 --> 01:27:35.250
- No, no, no, I think she should come
with us. It's all on the way.


975
01:27:36.170 --> 01:27:37.330
- Let's dance.

976
01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:55.890
- You've done so much
for my wife, madame.


977
01:27:56.050 --> 01:27:56.970
You are very kind.

978
01:27:57.690 --> 01:27:59.570
There's nothing I can do
to thank you.


979
01:28:00.130 --> 01:28:01.850
- But you don't need me
to tell you


980
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:03.850
that she's a very highly strung girl.

981
01:28:04.690 --> 01:28:06.490
There have been difficulties.

982
01:28:06.610 --> 01:28:09.490
One has had to protect her,
rather.


983
01:28:09.610 --> 01:28:13.010
- Against whom?
- Against herself, principally.


984
01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:17.290
We've seen too many girls left alone
to drift around Paris.


985
01:28:17.410 --> 01:28:20.170
- Yes.
People take advantage of them.


986
01:28:21.690 --> 01:28:23.730
- So it all comes down
to a question of money.


987
01:28:24.210 --> 01:28:25.730
I might've known with you!

988
01:28:25.850 --> 01:28:29.930
- Do look at H.J.
He can't dance and he hates it.


989
01:28:31.290 --> 01:28:33.850
I don't know
why he's doing it with her.


990
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:35.050
Do you?

991
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:37.410
- I expect you can tell me.

992
01:28:38.690 --> 01:28:41.450
Don't forget... 
I've been away.

993
01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:44.370
- I'm the last person to be able
to forget that,


994
01:28:44.490 --> 01:28:46.530
Monsieur... Zelli.

995
01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:56.170
Let's just sit here
and wait for them, shall we?


996
01:28:56.290 --> 01:28:57.690
- You've made a mistake, madame.

997
01:28:58.210 --> 01:29:00.210
I'm not the type to sit and wait.

998
01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:04.290
- I've had to long enough.

999
01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:11.570
- I've never shared a woman
in my life,


1000
01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:14.370
and now to have to share her
with someone like that.


1001
01:29:14.490 --> 01:29:16.410
He smells of jail.

1002
01:29:16.530 --> 01:29:18.330
- Oh, you disgust me.

1003
01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:22.450
- I have a horror of you.

1004
01:29:23.130 --> 01:29:25.170
When I think of you,
I feel sick!


1005
01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:26.890
(Mar ya laughing)

1006
01:29:27.010 --> 01:29:28.650
- Don't let her
stew up our game.


1007
01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:32.010
- What is it
that you want of me?


1008
01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:35.330
I told you I have to leave Paris
very soon.


1009
01:29:35.930 --> 01:29:37.250
- Take her with you.

1010
01:29:38.690 --> 01:29:40.490
Don't you see what will happen?

1011
01:29:41.050 --> 01:29:42.650
- That's between
the three of you.


1012
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:44.050
- She is your wife.

1013
01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:46.450
- I carry very little
when I travel.


1014
01:29:47.010 --> 01:29:50.090
- That must be very convenient,
but not everyone can do it.


1015
01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:52.810
Some of us have to put up
with things.


1016
01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:54.210
- Well, I wouldn't.

1017
01:29:54.490 --> 01:29:57.770
I'm used to living in a decent way
among decent people.


1018
01:30:00.730 --> 01:30:02.570
- You know the conditions.

1019
01:30:02.690 --> 01:30:05.690
- As if I could...
leave him that way.


1020
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:08.650
- It's all so abominably sordid.

1021
01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:10.490
And pitiful.

1022
01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:12.730
Pitiful.

1023
01:30:13.770 --> 01:30:15.450
- You should stay with Lois.

1024
01:30:16.810 --> 01:30:18.370
Just be with her.

1025
01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:21.170
She's your sort.

1026
01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:23.610
- Don't you think I long to?

1027
01:30:23.730 --> 01:30:25.530
So that I can be rid of you
once and for all.


1028
01:30:26.290 --> 01:30:29.330
And let you stay with your sort,
your convict husband.


1029
01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:34.010
(exclaiming)
(murmurings)


1030
01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:36.490
Ah.

1031
01:30:42.530 --> 01:30:44.810
Don't you think it's time
we rejoined our companions?


1032
01:31:21.490 --> 01:31:22.890
He went off, did he?

1033
01:31:23.490 --> 01:31:24.850
- He went off.

1034
01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:28.730
- Thank God.

1035
01:31:34.930 --> 01:31:36.890
(background chatter)

1036
01:32:21.090 --> 01:32:22.650
- Are you going alone?

1037
01:32:27.130 --> 01:32:28.610
I've had enough, too!

1038
01:32:28.730 --> 01:32:30.450
Up to here!

1039
01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:52.650
- So now we know.

1040
01:32:54.170 --> 01:32:56.130
- You've got to take me away
with you.


1041
01:32:56.890 --> 01:32:58.290
Away from them.

1042
01:32:59.170 --> 01:33:00.490
Please help me.

1043
01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:03.330
- You must think
I'm Jesus Christ.


1044
01:33:04.730 --> 01:33:06.650
So all the time you came
to visit me in jail,


1045
01:33:06.770 --> 01:33:07.930
you were Heidler's mistress.

1046
01:33:08.050 --> 01:33:10.810
You just came to laugh at me,
well put away behind the bars.


1047
01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:14.890
- Don't leave me, Stephan.

1048
01:33:16.930 --> 01:33:18.490
You're all I have.

1049
01:33:19.770 --> 01:33:20.890
Please.

1050
01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:23.530
Help me.

1051
01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:25.170
(Stephan muttering)

1052
01:33:27.530 --> 01:33:28.690
- Tell me...

1053
01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:31.330
when you were living
in the hotel...


1054
01:33:32.170 --> 01:33:33.770
Heidler came to visit you.

1055
01:33:34.410 --> 01:33:36.930
When did he come? Huh? Often?

1056
01:33:37.050 --> 01:33:38.570
(sniffling)
- No!


1057
01:33:38.690 --> 01:33:40.850
I don't remember.
It doesn't matter!!


1058
01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:42.490
- It doesn't matter.

1059
01:33:43.890 --> 01:33:45.450
You're funny, you.

1060
01:33:45.610 --> 01:33:47.730
You have a special way
of looking at things.


1061
01:33:48.570 --> 01:33:50.690
- He said he
had a horror of me.

1062
01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:53.170
And when he thought of me,
he felt sick.


1063
01:33:56.610 --> 01:33:58.370
Be kind to me, Stephan.

1064
01:33:59.330 --> 01:34:00.610
Be good to me.

1065
01:34:01.690 --> 01:34:04.330
Because I'm unhappy that I think
I'm going to die of it.


1066
01:34:04.450 --> 01:34:06.530
- Unhappy?
Of course you're unhappy.


1067
01:34:08.770 --> 01:34:11.970
Can't you see that this man,
who is at the end of his love,


1068
01:34:12.090 --> 01:34:14.010
this bag of bluff,

1069
01:34:14.130 --> 01:34:17.210
he just wants you as a sort of dessert
to finish off his meal?


1070
01:34:20.690 --> 01:34:22.170
My poor Mado.

1071
01:34:23.210 --> 01:34:24.490
Poor Mado.

1072
01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:27.250
- No, don't touch me.
Don't kiss me.


1073
01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:30.170
That isn't what I want.
- Then what is it you want?


1074
01:34:33.850 --> 01:34:35.210
Alright, I'll help you.

1075
01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:37.410
Only, do this.

1076
01:34:37.530 --> 01:34:39.770
Send a pneumatique to Heidler,
tell him to come here.


1077
01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:43.010
Say you have to speak to him urgently.
Go on, do it now.


1078
01:34:43.890 --> 01:34:45.610
- And then?
- Then [I'll be waiting for him.


1079
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:48.570
- You must be mad.
- He's made a fool of you.


1080
01:34:48.690 --> 01:34:50.570
He forgot me when he did that.

1081
01:34:50.690 --> 01:34:52.130
I'll be waiting for him.

1082
01:34:53.010 --> 01:34:54.970
I'll jump on him from behind the door
and break his back!


1083
01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:57.450
- You are mad!
- Go on, send a pneumatique.


1084
01:34:57.570 --> 01:34:59.130
I'll come with you.

1085
01:34:59.250 --> 01:35:01.810
- No!
- You poor thing, you.


1086
01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:04.250
What fools women are.

1087
01:35:05.330 --> 01:35:07.930
And it isn't only that they are
beasts and traitors,


1088
01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:09.450
but they are such fools!

1089
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:12.730
Well, stay here and weep.
I'll go and find Heidler myself.


1090
01:35:12.850 --> 01:35:14.130
Look here. You see this?

1091
01:35:14.850 --> 01:35:17.130
You thought I was well put away
behind the bars.


1092
01:35:17.850 --> 01:35:20.090
Wait a bit. Let me pass.

1093
01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:21.250
- No!
- Let me pass!


1094
01:35:21.410 --> 01:35:23.130
- No! you think
I'd let you touch him?!


1095
01:35:23.290 --> 01:35:25.410
I love him. I love him!

1096
01:35:25.530 --> 01:35:27.970
You think I care for you?
Not this much!


1097
01:35:28.090 --> 01:35:31.170
It's him. I love him! Heidler!

1098
01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:32.570
- Will you get away
from that door?


1099
01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:35.530
- You shan't go!
If you go, I'll call the police!


1100
01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:38.290
I'll go straight to the police station
and give you up!!


1101
01:35:38.930 --> 01:35:39.810
No!

1102
01:36:05.930 --> 01:36:07.850
- Ah!
(sniffling)


1103
01:36:26.370 --> 01:36:27.330
- Take me with you.

1104
01:36:27.450 --> 01:36:29.290
- No, I don't want anyone.
I'm late. Please leave me alone.


1105
01:36:29.410 --> 01:36:30.370
- Take me with you.

1106
01:36:30.490 --> 01:36:31.890
- I don't have any money.
- Well, I have some.


1107
01:36:32.010 --> 01:36:34.210
- I'm going to miss my train.
Please.


1108
01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:36.530
- I know a little hotel
in Amsterdam where we can stay.


1109
01:36:36.650 --> 01:36:37.890
Come. Hurry up.

1110
01:36:50.570 --> 01:36:51.770
- Stephan!!!

1111
01:38:02.530 --> 01:38:04.210
- Never mind, mademoiselle.

1112
01:38:05.170 --> 01:38:07.010
There are hundreds like them.

1113
01:38:08.490 --> 01:38:10.850
I must explain to you,
mademoiselle...


1114
01:38:11.530 --> 01:38:14.090
...that I am an old-fashioned
sort of person.


1115
01:38:14.890 --> 01:38:17.890
You can call me conservative
or traditionalist if you like,


1116
01:38:18.010 --> 01:38:19.890
but I believe in the family.

1117
01:38:20.690 --> 01:38:23.370
Parents and grandparents,

1118
01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:25.050
grandchildren, children.

1119
01:38:25.530 --> 01:38:28.810
Nowadays...
people live in a dirty way.


1120
01:38:31.090 --> 01:38:32.610
There's no tradition.

1121
01:38:38.690 --> 01:38:40.410
There's nothing beautiful.

1122
01:40:48.810 --> 01:40:50.770
